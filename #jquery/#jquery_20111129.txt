[00:00:46] <sanjayb> endra: yes, i'd say you just need to probably just return false or something if the element is currently animating .. or, yes, what is the ideal case of what should happen .. ?
[00:01:18] <endra> Eviltwin: first time: ':last' returns the last element, lets say #5 in the list, and is taking 500ms to slide it up. Once it is done sliding it up, then it removes it. If the second click is within 500ms, then it will attempt to slide/remove the last element twice. Other calculations are also done incorrectly due to this.
[00:01:32] <sanjayb> OR, remove / change the elements class before you slideUp() so that then the previous element will immediately be :last  .. if that's the only problem ..
[00:01:42] <Eviltwin> That's what I suggest
[00:03:21] <Eviltwin> endra: Alternatively you could do this: http://pastebin.com/JGZHmVgg
[00:03:39] <Eviltwin> Two quick dels in a row will only cause the first one to be removed
[00:03:42] <Eviltwin> The second will be ignored
[00:03:50] <megatrond> eviltwin: yes
[00:04:18] <Eviltwin> megatrond: Yes what?
[00:04:26] <Eviltwin> It has the issue?
[00:04:39] <endra> Thank you for the solutions. I'll look into them further and pick whichever one I think suits the problem the most.
[00:04:48] <megatrond> at least if i change the slideup with animate
[00:05:47] <Eviltwin> Did the link I sent work in IE7 or not?
[00:05:50] <Eviltwin> (Unmodified)
[00:07:58] <megatrond> Eviltwin: unmodified the image will display in its full, and then disappear
[00:08:18] <megatrond> while the border collapses behind it
[00:08:51] <Eviltwin> megatrond: Have you looked at this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1830328/jquery-slidedown-slideup-not-working-in-ie7
[00:09:40] <megatrond> Eviltwin: i'll try that
[00:10:16] <Eviltwin> Well I'm headed out
[00:10:20] <Eviltwin> So you're on your own
[00:10:22] <Eviltwin> Good luck

[01:32:55] <GoSox> So I have a form that I submit. I have some animation on "beforeSubmit" that takes one second. Then I have animation on "success" that also takes one second. Is there an easy way I can make the "success" animation hold, and wait until the first animation is done? Otherwise, if the server response is very fast, the animations overlap. When I'd rather have them go one, then the other
[01:33:41] <GoSox> I originally had the second animation as a callback of the first, both in the "success" handler. But then the problem is that if the server response is slow, the whole form hangs until the server response. I want the initial animation to happen right away
[01:33:58] <Zogot> Surely though, the animations are there to show its working in case its slow
[01:34:06] <Zogot> People are looking for the data not pictures right?
[01:34:34] <Zogot> If it doesn't need a loading bar, thats a good thing :)
[01:34:59] <GoSox> i'm talking about jquery animations, not animated images
[01:37:26] <clasificado> maybe you can use the .stop().animate() chain, so the "sending" animation dont make the user wait, but also dont overlap with the "success" animation
[01:39:10] <GoSox> when i say animation, i'm talking about a .hide(1000); and a .show(1000);
[01:39:38] <clasificado> thats okay, you can use .stop().show(1000);
[01:39:54] <GoSox> and what does that do?
[01:40:05] <dgx> Can I use a callback functiion(with .ajax in it) in another .ajax function? I think there won't be any problems, right?
[01:40:24] <clasificado> it terminates the .hide() operation at the current frame, and starts the show one with the current values
[01:40:43] <dgx> Something like : click for vote, and when the user click on #vote, the votes are update(aka facebook style)?
[01:40:59] <GoSox> clasificado: that's not going to help. Then I'm going to have a half-hidden form sitting on the page, with a submission message next ot it
[01:41:37] <Philipp__> hey guys... I'm using jqureyUI for creating dialogs.. Is it possible to bind a rightclick event on the buttons created by jquery?
[01:42:19] <GoSox> not all computers have right click, probably not a good idea to use it
[01:42:34] <GoSox> other than as a shortcut
[01:42:47] <Philipp__> no..I'd like to prevent rightclicking..
[01:42:57] <GoSox> oh
[01:42:58] <Kingsy> if I have a variable with a html get() result in it... what is the best way of taking out a specific tag and its contents?
[01:43:07] <Philipp__> because I'm using a form submitted by ajax.. and when rightclick is triggered it sends the data without ajax
[01:43:28] <Cork> Kingsy: $(result).find('selector')
[01:43:47] <Kingsy> Cork: but the result is in a variable...
[01:44:04] <Kingsy> so isnt it something like  result = result.find('blhag'); ?
[01:47:04] <Kingsy> ah got it
[01:51:24] <Cork> Kingsy: if result is html, then you need to parse it first

[01:53:29] <seutje> bot-t1: tell Philipp__ you left within 5 mins of posing a question, here's your answer: don't bind a click handler to a submit button, bind a submit handler to a form

I would like to click the link on the left and to load the image on the rigth.... small exemple --> http://dpaste.com/663233/  how should i do?
[02:11:18] <sanjayb> xro: $('img').attr("src", newSrc);
[02:11:42] <seutje> deebo: have whatever modifies the DOM to dispatch an event
[02:12:20] <arepie> Hello
[02:12:54] <xro> sanjayb, i'm sorry but i just begin with Jquery :(   i need to tag my link on the right, no?
[02:13:12] <xro> sanjayb, left!
[02:14:18] <aaronmcadam> deebo: you'd need to use pubsub for something like that
[02:14:21] <sanjayb> xro: hm, yea .. looking at your code .. lemme give u an example, then im on my way ..
[02:14:47] <aaronmcadam> deebo: https://gist.github.com/1321768
[02:16:07] <arepie> i would like to ask, im using jqueryui dialog, and inside the dialog i have a form and a single textarea. Is there any way i could find the name of the textarea inside the dialog. The text area is reated dynamiccaly
[02:16:15] <aaronmcadam> xro: $('img')[0].src = ''
[02:17:28] <sanjayb> xro: look through this: http://dpaste.com/663239/ .. its kind've crude, but try n understand what it does, why, etc. and hopefully you can figure it out ..
[02:17:30] <xro> aaronmcadam, yes i read about the $('img').... and so on... but it's a bit obscur for me (it's my first time)... So, i wait on the sanjayb exemple to understanf
[02:17:42] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[02:17:49] <aaronmcadam> what's hard about that?
[02:17:57] <xro> sanjayb, thank you.. i'll read it
[02:18:02] <aaronmcadam> select an img and set the src property to whatever
[02:18:23] <aaronmcadam> u don't need to use attr
[02:18:26] <aaronmcadam> but ok
[02:18:28] <xro> aaronmcadam, first time is always hard... And i'm not a web developper...
[02:18:39] <aaronmcadam> so what are u then? haha
[02:19:41] <xro> aaronmcadam, a IT security guy... presentation is not really my job... but i have to sometimes...
[02:19:54] <sanjayb> xro: you really should spend some time reading up about basic html / selectors / jquery before you delve into this stuff, though.

[02:20:38] <xro> i'll read it... to have a better understanding of the magic and obscur Jquery language :)
[02:20:45] <aaronmcadam> it's not a language
[02:20:48] <aaronmcadam> it's a library
[02:20:53] <xro> yes lib...

[02:21:16] <aaronmcadam> ?jsisjs
[02:21:16] <bot-t1> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.

[02:24:57] <sanjayb> xro: http://dpaste.com/663242/
[02:25:45] <sanjayb> nFFF: jquery is compatible, yes. but it won't magically make whatever you're trying to do work in ie7 and ie8 .. is there something specific that's "not working" ?
[02:26:00] <nFFF> sanjayb, yes

[02:27:17] <nFFF> Howeevr in IE 7/8 it doesnt work correctly

[02:27:37] <nFFF> where as in i. 7/8 only the border of the input does
[02:27:58] <arepie> i have 1 more question, does ajax have character limit to send on post ?
[02:29:51] <sanjayb> nFFF: hm, i dont have IE to test, but perhaps if you're trying to use "opacity", IE does not like that so much?

[02:36:25] <Haraldson> with .on(), is it possible to retrieve the parent element the listener is attached to? I have multiple possible containers, but only one matches at a time
[02:36:26] <Haraldson> $('#container1, #container2')
[02:36:26] <Haraldson>     .on('click', '.pick-std-image', function(e)
[02:36:26] <Haraldson>     {
[02:36:26] <Haraldson>         // I want to refer to the parent, #container1 or #container2 dynamically here
[02:36:26] <Haraldson>     });
[02:37:34] <MrBenn> e.target
[02:37:40] <MrBenn> harladson ^
[02:37:48] <MrBenn> haraldson*
[02:38:37] <Haraldson> I thought the e.target would still be the innermost element matched by .on's selector argument, but I guess you're right
[02:38:38] <Haraldson> silly me
[02:39:35] <milligan> Using JQueryUI I am opening new pages in a .dialog(). Can I "contain" the new pages inside the dialog so that links clicked etc will operate inside the dialog? I want to base my page on a panel type of design where a user can open several panels and work with at the same time...
[02:39:57] <MrBenn> Ah
[02:40:33] <Cork> milligan: no, you can't contain it; you can load a separat page in an iframe but no other way
[02:40:33] <MrBenn> Sorry Haraldson, if the selector is a child of the container then you just do e.target.parentNode
[02:41:09] <milligan> Corey, I presume opening an iframe inside the dialog would be considered very poor programming? :P
[02:41:14] <milligan> Cork *
[02:41:15] <Haraldson> MrBenn: Don't want to tie it too closely to the exact DOM structure
[02:41:40] <Cork> milligan: its not something you want to do if you can avoide it no
[02:42:04] <milligan> hmz. Guess that's my plan down the drain :(
[02:42:14] <Cork> milligan: but you can't load other sites into your own through ajax so there isn't really another choice, except proxying it through your own server
[02:43:02] <milligan> Cork, it's not a remote site I want opening .. I'm writing a control panel sort of system for different services locally .. and I would like each operator menu to work from a panel ..
[02:43:19] <Cork> milligan: then it is doable
[02:43:46] <milligan> Cork, using dialog, or should I be using .draggable() and designing my own containers ?
[02:43:46] <Zogot> Does anything have some example of some OOP style jQuery?
[02:43:52] <Cork> milligan: bind a delegate to the dialog and find all link tags with it
[02:44:22] <Cork> milligan: then block them from doing there normal action and load them through ajax, and do what they should do in the dialog
[02:44:49] <Cork> milligan: i do that for a wiki service i use on a page
[02:46:56] <milligan> Cork, can I open a new page in an existing dialog? I.e if I click a link.. ?
[02:47:06] <Cork> sure
[02:47:30] <milligan> How do I make it open in the dialog and not in the parent window ?
[02:47:40] <Cork> just $('#my-dialog').html(new_content);
[02:47:55] <Cork> milligan: you block all the links from changing page
[02:48:04] <Cork> milligan: and instead load the page thorugh ajax
[02:48:21] <Cork> milligan: preferably the server only sends the body part so you don't have to filter that out
[02:48:28] <milligan> the dialogs get generated on the fly, so they don't have ids .. I guess $(this).html then ..
[02:48:49] * milligan tests
[02:49:21] <walid> hi all! i'm trying to implement isotope, a tiling plugin, but i don't get the expected result..
[02:49:38] <walid> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/index.html
[02:49:44] <walid> would anyone mind taking a look?
[02:49:57] <alex88> hi guys, is possible to select divs giving a coordinate?
[02:49:59] <walid> this is my site: http://vbbros.net/advent/
[02:52:35] <Cork> alex88: no, not from content
[02:52:56] <Cork> alex88: you can do it from mousemove or things like that though
[02:53:32] <alex88> Cork: but you'll have to check each div if it has mouse, not from mouse to divs right?
[02:54:10] <Cork> alex88: you can bind mousemove to the window or body and check event.target
[02:55:02] <alex88> Cork: won't it return just the objects you've binded on? or also elements (and maybe only element on top)?
[02:55:33] <Cork> alex88: the target is the element you hovered over
[02:55:53] <Cork> alex88: ah, yes it will the the top one if there is several in a layer
[02:56:59] <alex88> Cork: ok thank you very much for helping
[02:57:43] <alex88> Cork: there is also a document.elementFromPoint but it gives too only the top element
[02:59:15] <sanjayb> there's document.elementFromPoint .. wow :-)
[02:59:16] <SoulRaven> hi
[02:59:55] <SoulRaven> when using .on() , is it posibile to define multiple element for the same event trigger?
[03:00:05] <SoulRaven> something: $(')
[03:00:31] <Cork> SoulRaven: sure just use a normal selector in the element part
[03:00:39] <walid> SoulRaven: not sure what you want, but you can use $('.trigger1').add('.trigger2')
[03:00:44] <solidus-lake> what trigger does a form element throw before it submits
[03:00:46] <SoulRaven> something: $('warrper').on('click', #element1, #element2, element3, function(){    });
[03:00:54] <solidus-lake> i want to run a function pior to the data getting sent from the form
[03:00:59] <walid> if you dont want to $('trigger1, trigger2')
[03:01:00] <Cork> SoulRaven: exactly
[03:01:05] <walid> use*
[03:01:20] <Cork> walid: that will bind one event to each element
[03:01:43] <sanjayb> solidus-lake: $('form').submit(function(e) { ... }); ... ?
[03:01:53] <walid> Cork: just re-read the question
[03:01:55] <walid> sry ^^
[03:02:19] <walid> i have a problem using isotope with big elements..
[03:03:01] <MrBenn> big elements?
[03:03:06] <walid> trying to tile elements, but i don't get expected results
[03:03:11] <walid> MrBenn: well i have this:
[03:03:14] <walid> http://vbbros.net/advent/
[03:03:32] <walid> MrBenn: working more or less fine.
[03:03:59] <walid> thing is i have inside these boxes images of variable sizes.
[03:04:46] <walid> (i turned this off ftm). so the plugin works, but as soon as i add my images(which i'll do now), you can see the difference.
[03:04:50] <MrBenn> you need to add a conditional to check the date too :P
[03:04:58] <MrBenn> so people can't cheat and open them all one one day
[03:05:16] <walid> MrBenn: i did :P
[03:05:19] <SoulRaven> Cork: but the elements are array, how i put multiple element in on method
[03:05:30] <SoulRaven> ^.on()
[03:05:34] <MrBenn> oh I see
[03:05:40] <MrBenn> Yeah
[03:05:46] <walid> see now?
[03:05:50] <Cork> SoulRaven: are array?
[03:05:54] <MrBenn> I didn't realise some of them where in november :P
[03:06:00] <Cork> SoulRaven: you mean before you add them to the dom?
[03:06:01] <MrBenn> were*
[03:06:05] <SoulRaven> object, my mistake
[03:06:16] <walid> MrBenn: (plus it's just a small gift for my gf, no need to over engineer anything )
[03:06:33] <walid> MrBenn: yes it's an advent calendar!
[03:06:43] <MrBenn> Nice idea
[03:07:05] <walid> (but little time no money, i thought i'd do it this way. plus i can populate it day by day, which is pretty neat ^^)
[03:07:18] <walid> so anyways, the tiling isn't working.. :(
[03:07:35] <greytrilby> Just a quicky here - have a page that operates as a holder. Uses jquery/ajax to load content into a central holding div. Content pages also require jquery for some of their functionality. Do I need to call jquery .js file in each page, or is the fact that I called it for the very first page enough?
[03:08:21] <Cork> greytrilby: your loading the other pages inline or in iframe?
[03:08:32] <walid> MrBenn: any clue?
[03:08:34] <greytrilby> Cork: inline
[03:08:42] <Muimi> Is a "compound css selector" a selector which selects multiple elements?
[03:08:52] <Cork> greytrilby: then no you don't need to load jquery
[03:09:04] <SoulRaven> Cork: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/65795002
[03:09:32] <greytrilby> @Cork: Cheers - that's what I thought - had some trouble with stuff not working until I added jquery .js link, but I think that was right at the beginning (when I was working in an iframe!)
[03:09:48] <sanjayb> greytrilby: you don't need to include jquery again -- but any event handlers, etc. that get attached to elements on the pages you load via ajax you would need to make sure they get attached, or use .live() or so
[03:10:09] <pyparadigm> Is there any way to not lose a :hover on element, once you change the element via .css() ?
[03:10:30] <greytrilby> @sanjay - cheers - most stuff like that i've loaded into a function which I then call in the 'success' parameter
[03:10:34] <MrBenn> walid: maybe a height/width declaration issue?
[03:10:37] <pyparadigm> I have a :hover, it works fine until I run element.css() then :hover no longer works
[03:10:59] <walid> MrBenn: so i should explicitely tell each div their sizes, you reckon?
[03:11:01] <Cork> SoulRaven: thats not selectors, thats the data
[03:11:04] <walid> that sucks.. ;)
[03:11:15] <Cork> SoulRaven: your only sending true/false
[03:11:18] <MrBenn> Yeah, I've had issues with that on stuff before
[03:11:26] <MrBenn> pain in the arse
[03:11:31] <walid> if that's the case, i'm probably better off using the imgs as background images or so...
[03:11:41] <greytrilby> @cork, @sanjayb - at the moment I have quite a few 'content' pages that still call the jquery.js file - would that have a performance impact? Have noticed that when I'm running the app for a period of time, FF starts to have hissy fits. Not sure if that's FF or the fact that I keep loading js files over and over!
[03:12:10] <Cork> greytrilby; yes, that can cause problems
[03:13:14] <greytrilby> @cork - cheers fella - had a horrible feeling that was the case!
[03:13:21] * greytrilby trudges back to netbeans
[03:14:25] <timing> guys, I get a lot of these warnings: event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future.
[03:14:38] <timing> running 1.7.1
[03:14:50] <solidus-lake> sanjayb: hmm, it doesnt seem that submit is doing its job, its as though the form can be altered but what gets submitted isn't based on the state of the form after the function
[03:17:06] <timing> O wait, it might be highcharts, never mind!
[03:17:09] <sanjayb> solidus-lake: hm, i think there maybe a beforeSubmit() maybe what u want .. or inside the .submit(function(e) { ... }); call e.preventDefault(); make your modifications, and submit the form yourself ..
[03:17:21] <beasty> bah
[03:17:26] <beasty> i hate uniform.js
[03:18:04] <beasty> for some reason the <div> is generated outside the <p></p>
[03:21:13] <solidus-lake> sanjayb: cool, those are good solutions and good ways to think, i ended up modifying the logic so that the event that triggers something is the 'change' event of the form element its dependent on
[03:21:31] <janet_xoxo> oeu
[03:22:00] <beasty> hmm
[03:22:11] <sanjayb> solidus-lake: sure, cool - not sure why changing values before submitting did not work tho :( - i generally do e.preventDefault() and submit forms via ajax tho, or just direct submit without any js in the middle, so have not run into that specific issue ..
[03:22:12] <beasty> anyknown issues with after(); before(); ?
[03:22:20] <beasty> for some reason the html is messed up
[03:22:38] <sanjayb> beasty: possibly the issue is with the way you're using it? :-) .. paste some code?
[03:23:22] <beasty> sanjayb: ok
[03:23:23] <deleted> hello, i got a problem, Someone can tell me how to replace all the space in a string? (myString.replace(" ", "-"); replace juste the first space)
[03:24:59] <deleted> no idea?
[03:25:35] <beasty> sanjayb: https://gist.github.com/9ab14fbfca70ce9951ab
[03:25:44] <sanjayb> deleted: myString.replace(/\s/g, "-")
[03:26:31] <deleted> sanjayb: Thanks !
[03:26:52] <beasty> brb feeding time
[03:32:03] <walid> MrBenn: argh i'm going crazy here i don't know how to do this without explicitely giving each div a dimension, which i can't really know in advance..
[03:32:12] <walid> i tried this: $('.day').height($(this).filter(':first').height()); 	$('.day').width($(this).filter(':first').width());
[03:36:25] <sanjayb> walid: what exactly are you trying to achieve ... ?
[03:36:46] <walid> sanjayb: i'm trying to implement the isotope plugin
[03:36:55] <walid> ( http://isotope.metafizzy.co/ )
[03:36:55] <sanjayb> walid: ah okay, sorry - not familiar with it.
[03:37:27] <walid> on my page. it's basically just a tiling plugin
[03:37:38] <walid> sanjayb: thanks anyways!
[03:37:39] <walid> :)
[03:40:45] <doktorj> hi - can someone tell me how to select all text inputs that are currently hidden with a class .div  ?
[03:41:33] <doktorj> $(".row input:hidden")  or something?
[03:48:22] <Karamon> Hello, I'm having an issue setting up a handler to stop execution of a normal submit event and then doing stuff after that.  The page submits normally which is what I don't want.. thoughts?  http://pastebin.com/mFjBMMLC
[03:49:40] <shellox> hi
[03:49:57] <MrBenn> conditional on line 18 isn't returning false maybe?
[03:50:03] <MrBenn> Karamon ^
[03:50:05] <shellox>   $('.fo').click(function() {
[03:50:05] <shellox>         alert('hi');
[03:50:07] <shellox>       });
[03:50:44] <josefrichter> why this string.replace doesn't work please? http://jsfiddle.net/josefrichter/Fz9t9/
[03:50:55] <shellox> i have a question to this code: it is between a <form> and it alert hi first, but submit then. Why did this happen?
[03:51:27] <Karamon> MrBenn, the page submits before any code executes from what I can tell, so I don't think its getting that far.
[03:51:48] <MrBenn> because the .fo element is set to submit type, shellox
[03:52:00] <MrBenn> set to type button shellox
[03:52:33] <MrBenn> Karamon are you sure the event is being applied to the right form?
[03:52:52] <shellox> MrBenn: it isnt!
[03:53:30] <MrBenn> Shellox does it need to be inside the form element? try moving it outside of the form tags if possible.
[03:53:32] <shellox> <button class='fo'>+</button>
[03:53:37] <MrBenn> oh
[03:53:45] <shellox> i have no idea why this happens
[03:53:45] <MrBenn> yeah by default its a submit type
[03:53:50] <MrBenn> you need to add type='button'
[03:54:02] <shellox> wtf, really?
[03:54:04] <MrBenn> Yes
[03:54:13] <shellox> button type='button'?
[03:54:13] <Kingsy> if I have a var that contains markup how do I insert that markup into the page before another tag as a reference point?
[03:54:22] <Karamon> MrBenn: I could pastebin up the HTML for the form as a sanity check but I'm pretty confident my ducks are in order in that regard.
[03:54:32] <GreyTrilby> @Cork - you around?
[03:55:03] <shellox> MrBenn: ok, thanks for your help\
[03:55:59] <shellox> MrBenn: never thought that such a shit exists >.< WTH, it's submit by default?
[03:56:05] <MrBenn> Karamon, you need to put the .submit call inside a .click/.on('click') call for the submit button
[03:56:10] <MrBenn> or it will submit on load
[03:56:27] <MrBenn> Shellox: I know it's a pain in the arse
[03:57:25] <shellox> MrBenn: yep! I failed for 2 hours with this and tried really everything
[03:57:38] <shellox> what a waste of time :/
[03:58:40] <Kingsy> hmm looks like after() and append() don't do what i need..
[03:58:43] <Kingsy> any ideas anyone?
[03:58:53] <Karamon> MrBenn: Not that I can't try that, but the jQuery docs should be updated then, they don't have any hooks for click events in the info http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[03:59:06] <GreyTrilby> @Kingsy - have you tried prependTo()?
[03:59:34] <GreyTrilby> Problem with loading scripts. Have a holding page which loads content. Content (loaded inline, not in iframe) is usually a page with JQueryUI tabs. Tabs then load sub-pages via ajax/load. Used to have each subage calling jquery.js, but then was sagely advised this would be bad :) Have now removed references to load jquery on each content page (aka 'holder') and each subpage. Problem now is that half my scripts have stopped working,
[04:00:14] <aleray_> Hi, i'm looking for the equivalent of set() in python
[04:00:36] <aleray_> I found jQuery.unique() but it only works for dom elements
[04:01:40] <Kingsy> GreyTrilby: well no, cos that says append an html element to another.. so say this example     <div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>  (just imagine that those p's have classes so we could select em) you could append something to the div but you couldnt say where it was going to appear in the div.. what if I wanted to get an element to appear before the third p tag? say it had a classname of   "third_p"
[04:01:47] <nFFF> Guys I have some input elements, with inline labels, and when you click the input element via jQuery, it updates the label CSS so the opacity goes to 0, which is fine. However in another scenario the form data comes already set, and the labels are still visible
[04:02:13] <nFFF> Is there any way function in jQuery that would recognise if the input field already has a value set
[04:02:48] <Kingsy> oh hang on it might
[04:03:22] <Kingsy> no it still inserts it inside the tag you specify
[04:03:53] <GreyTrilby> and doing after doesn't work either? Are you sure the selector is working properly?
[04:04:04] <Karamon> MrBenn: I wrapped the handler in window.onload stuff and that fixed it, didn't realize that was necessary.
[04:04:12] <MrBenn> Ah
[04:04:14] <MrBenn> Yeah
[04:04:37] <Kingsy> hmm must be, let me double check
[04:05:39] <MrBenn> nFFF try .val()
[04:08:09] <burzum> how can i figure out if an element has any js events attached or listen to it?
[04:09:21] <Zogot> from the front end?
[04:09:40] <Zogot> you can use something like chromes inspector.  It shows at the very bottom of the right panel and listeners
[04:09:51] <burzum> Zogot thanks, let me check that
[04:12:36] <beasty> sanjayb: stil alive ?
[04:13:39] <jes> How do I toggle the child div of the div clicked?
[04:14:03] <burzum> Zogot i see that i can set dom breakpoints somehow, but how do i tell the inspector it should break on my element i suspect to have the event attached im looking for?
[04:14:07] <nFFF> MrBenn thanks
[04:14:16] <nFFF> Is there any reason to have inline javascript on a page
[04:14:21] <solidus-lake> in jquery how do i do an || operator in my filter?
[04:14:24] <nFFF> why not keep it in seperate .js files?
[04:14:42] <solidus-lake> $(".class || .other_class || .third_class")
[04:14:45] <Karamon> nFFF: Its just a style choice.  It does keep the page cleaner if it isn't horked full of JS
[04:14:49] <solidus-lake> erm, selector
[04:14:52] <Cork> solidus-lake: css selectors do comma as separators
[04:14:54] <beasty> $(this).children('div').toggle();
[04:15:09] <solidus-lake> Cork: thanks!
[04:15:12] <nFFF> Karamon, Im building on top of a CMS, which for any one page could like 10-15 files
[04:15:17] <nFFF> all contian inline javascript
[04:15:23] <nFFF> fucking nightmare for me to add and change thigns
[04:15:37] <Karamon> nFFF: Welcome to the wonderful world of web development :D
[04:15:42] <beasty> nFFF: that's not a problem

[04:16:03] <beasty> css/js/images
[04:16:03] <nFFF> its just annoying
[04:16:19] <nFFF> and time consuming, and illogical
[04:16:45] <Karamon> nFFF: moar coffee (or whiskey)
[04:17:58] <sanjayb> beasty: was afk, and on my way out .. sorry i didn't really understand what you were trying to do with looking at your paste ..
[04:19:36] <beasty> easy
[04:19:46] <nFFF> How in jQuery do I see if a variable exists: if($(input).val) ?
[04:19:48] <beasty> sanjayb: i have a <div></div> containing html
[04:20:00] <beasty> sanjayb: and it needs to be appended in another <div>
[04:20:06] <nFFF> Would that if statement work
[04:20:42] <JKarsrud> if($('input').val() != "")
[04:21:00] <JKarsrud> or === "whatever val you want to check against"
[04:21:20] <xec> maybe !== rather than != too
[04:21:38] <xec> depending on what you want
[04:22:44] <beasty> Oldskool baby!
[04:23:05] <beasty> oh crap highlighted someone
[04:23:06] <beasty> :s
[04:23:10] <beasty> and hi xec
[04:23:34] <xec> hehe, hi
[04:23:35] <nFFF> JKarsrud thanks
[04:23:37] <nFFF> if (jQuery('input').val() != "") {
[04:23:37] <nFFF> 		jQuery(this).prev("label").addClass("changed");
[04:23:37] <nFFF> 		}
[04:23:44] <nFFF> any reason why this doesnt work
[04:23:46] <beasty> mm this is weird
[04:23:56] <beasty> my html gets deformed after a .append();
[04:23:57] <nFFF> should add class 'changed' to every label whos input has a value
[04:23:59] <xec> ?demo @ nFFF
[04:23:59] <bot-t1> nFFF, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[04:25:03] <xec> nFFF: .val() will return the value of the *first* element in the set, iirc
[04:25:47] <xec> nFFF: so if you want to check each of the inputs, maybe see ?each

[04:27:38] <xec> you mean left hand side?
[04:27:42] <xec> :)
[04:27:44] <nFFF> Sorry yes
[04:27:52] <xec> but yeah, i see the mess
[04:28:13] <nFFF> Quite simply, it isn't adding class 'changed'

[04:28:48] <xec> nFFF: when?
[04:28:58] <nFFF> When the form loads
[04:29:04] <nFFF> all the input's that have a value
[04:29:11] <nFFF> should add class 'changed' to the prev. label
[04:29:30] <Karamon> nFFF: Think xec is right, each is what yer lookin' for

[04:35:29] <nFFF> Ok great .each()
[04:36:30] <nFFF> works
[04:39:52] <xec> nFFF: for reference, this is what i meant with pared-down: http://jsfiddle.net/QZG5x/2/
[04:40:15] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/QZG5x/3/ Ok, now its adding class 'changed' to label elements, who's mathcing <inptu doesn;t have a value
[04:40:26] <Karamon> xec: value lol = win
[04:40:51] <Oldskool> beasty: hello again ^^
[04:41:04] <xec> Karamon: should have thrown in a "hotpink" too, for good measure :D
[04:42:13] <jes> I have a lot of divs (I don't know their ID's when someone clicks them) how do I envoke the click method on the one I cliked?
[04:42:37] <nFFF> xec, I understand but sometimes, pared-down version don't reproduce the whole picture :>
[04:43:02] <Karamon> jes: I don't understand what your trying to do, could you explain what you want the user to experience?
[04:43:32] <jes> Karamon: i have a lot of data in divs. When i click a div I want part of it to toggle.
[04:43:47] <jes> Doing $(this).children("div").toggle(); makes the whole page disspear
[04:44:07] <jes> oops $('div').click(function() { $(this).children('div').toggle(); });
[04:44:23] <nFFF> xec, http://jsfiddle.net/QZG5x/4/
[04:44:26] <nFFF> pared down version
[04:44:32] <nFFF> It now works
[04:44:49] <nFFF> But its adding class 'changed' to labels whos input's value isnt set
[04:44:51] <Cork> jes: whats the first element in your body?
[04:45:08] <jes> div i guess
[04:45:26] <Cork> you prob want to do event.stopPropagation() in your click
[04:45:36] <xec> you're basically putting a click event on every div you have
[04:45:38] <Cork> so the div you click stops parent divs from triggering
[04:45:56] <beasty> hmm
[04:45:58] <Cork> xec: not basically, thats exactly what he's doing :)
[04:46:00] <jes> Yeah so the question is: how do I invoke the click for the div i cliked (i don't know the id)
[04:46:03] <beasty> it's getting weirder by the second
[04:46:20] <Cork> jes: you prob want to do event.stopPropagation() in your click <--
[04:46:24] <Karamon> jes: You probably want to assign a ID or class to the elements you want toggle-able
[04:46:30] <Cork> jes: thats the solution
[04:46:31] <xec> causing the outermost div to hide its children div (as well as triggering any others you clicked)
[04:46:55] <Karamon> jes: And that would help you narrow the scope of what is clickable (along with the other suggestions)
[04:47:58] <jes> Cork: now something strange is happening, it toggles the div selected, but after like 0.5 sec it toggles back.
[04:48:36] <Cork> jes: sounds like you have multible event listners or something
[04:48:52] <beasty> hmm
[04:48:59] <nFFF> xec, fixed it, thanks
[04:49:02] <beasty> it seems my js is adding extra <p></p> tags
[04:49:03] <xec> nFFF: you're selecting "input" inside your loop, rather than using the current iteration
[04:49:04] <Cork> jes: you prob want to look at live or delegate instead of binding the event on each element
[04:49:10] <nFFF> xec, yes, stupid error
[04:49:19] <Cork> jes: that would be much more efficient, nad you wouldn't have to rebind it all the time
[04:49:22] <nFFF> just needed to change it to 'this'
[04:49:28] <Cork> (if its dynamic)
[04:49:28] <xec> indeed :)
[04:49:52] <beasty> xec: ever seen that ?
[04:50:56] <jes> Cork: actually it works, I was clicking on an a in the div and it was refreshing the page. Silly me. :)
[04:51:06] <jes> thanks guys. :)
[04:51:14] <Cork> lol
[04:51:16] <xec> beasty: nope
[04:51:35] <Cork> jes: the statement still stands, creating that many event listners slow down the dom
[04:51:47] <Cork> jes: so you prob want to look at a more efficient way to do it
[04:51:55] <jes> what would that be?
[04:52:11] <Cork> jes: see ?.live and see ?.delegate
[04:52:12] <bot-t1> jes, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[04:52:12] <bot-t1> jes, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:52:27] <jes> thanks
[04:52:31] <Cork> jes: those attach one event listner to a parent, and filter that
[04:52:38] <Cork> its MUCH more efficient
[04:53:26] <jes> got it. :)
[04:53:55] <xec> jes: or, if you have version 1.7 or later, use http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:55:02] <jes> Also there's a problem with my solution, cause whenever I click a div that is forming page loyout if it has children it hides them. Lol.
[04:55:46] <Cork> jes: well parent hides children when they hide
[04:56:04] <Cork> jes: you might want to set a class on the elements you want to be able to hide and use that instead?
[04:56:13] <jes> oh right.
[04:58:32] <beasty> is there a know issue that firefox automaticly closes a p tag?
[04:58:48] <Cork> closes?
[04:59:09] <beasty> yes it's realy weirds
[04:59:13] <Cork> well the error correction kicks in when you append the html to the dom
[04:59:23] <Cork> other then that, no
[05:02:17] <SoulRaven> if i have a costum event defined with .bind() cand trigger that event using .on()
[05:02:18] <SoulRaven> ?
[05:02:56] <beasty> Cork: https://gist.github.com/68e205a6fa0af0f1c7fb
[05:03:08] <Cork> ?.trigger @ SoulRaven
[05:03:09] <bot-t1> SoulRaven, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[05:03:58] <Cork> beasty: culd you pg the code your using to?
[05:04:07] <SoulRaven> Cork: ok, but i want to capture the event end execute when is happend
[05:04:23] <SoulRaven> to capture live, like .on()
[05:04:25] <Cork> SoulRaven: capture should work with .on yes
[05:05:14] <beasty> cork sure
[05:05:18] <beasty> hang on
[05:06:53] <JillesCode> hello guys I have an input box, and I want the value (which is "Search here") to fade out, on the first time you click it, how'd I do that?
[05:07:19] <JillesCode> nevermind I know how, sorry!
[05:07:48] <beasty> Cork: https://gist.github.com/862e040a3a18635b97b1
[05:07:55] <beasty> that should give you a idea
[05:09:47] <Cork> beasty: and its like 82 where you get the extra p?
[05:10:21] <beasty> Cork: yes
[05:11:00] <Cork> beasty: the extra p start tag might com from the error correction ya
[05:11:15] <beasty> excuse me ?
[05:11:40] <beasty> ya ?
[05:11:48] <Cork> beasty: throw the html through a html validator so you don't have an unclosed tag somewhere
[05:11:57] <Cork> that can give effects like that
[05:13:36] <nFFF> How would you check to see if any element has any sub elements
[05:14:23] <dabear> nFFF: check its .children().length
[05:14:28] <Cork> nFFF: you mean direct child?
[05:14:40] <Cork> or just if it has any children at all?
[05:14:53] <nFFF> yea child
[05:14:58] <nFFF> any children at all
[05:15:08] <dabear> Cork: if it has a child then it mus also have a direct child
[05:15:26] <nFFF> I need to check to see if it has any children
[05:15:28] <dabear> nFFF: .children().length
[05:15:33] <Cork> dabear: the difference was if he wanted to find a specific children
[05:15:36] <Cork> *child
[05:15:51] <nFFF> dabear, .children().length != 0) ?
[05:15:53] <Cork> but that won't work as a selector
[05:16:15] <dabear> nFFF: yes
[05:16:35] <dabear> !!$(foo).children().length
[05:16:46] <dabear> is what I would have done though
[05:17:40] <ajaxbud> Hi there.. I am having a problem using .submit with jquery 1.4.4
[05:17:47] <dabear> ok
[05:17:52] <Cork> nFFF: if you want to find all elements that have children something like this is the best i can think of $('*').grep(function(elm) { return $(elm).children().length > 0; })
[05:17:53] <ajaxbud> My code is comething liek this
[05:18:01] <ajaxbud> $('#Form1').submit(function() {
[05:18:01] <ajaxbud>                     document.getElementById('message').innerHTML = '';
[05:18:01] <ajaxbud>                     $(this).ajaxSubmit(options);
[05:18:01] <ajaxbud>                     alert("I am here");
[05:18:01] <ajaxbud>                     return false;
[05:18:02] <ajaxbud>                 });
[05:18:07] <Cork> ...
[05:18:19] <ajaxbud> it never alerts the message
[05:18:20] <Cork> ajaxbud: never EVER post multible lines of code in the channel
[05:18:27] <ajaxbud> oh sorry

[05:19:17] <bittyx-work> i want to start 3 animations at the same time, and do something once only when all of them are finished. how do i do this/where do i look?

[05:21:02] <xec> bittyx-work: what are these animations? maybe you can do-all-the-things in one animation?
[05:21:14] <impi> hey guys, i get a date like this: new Date; but i want to add minutes, hours and seconds to it, cant seem to get it right :(
[05:21:55] <bittyx-work> xec: nah, i need to animate separate objects with separate arguments (i thought about ways to do it all at once, but stuff i thought of really seems to hacky and just not right)
[05:22:06] <xec> impi: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[05:22:27] <devnill> quick question: how do I select by anchor in a href?
[05:22:58] <devnill> as in <a href="#thisPart">...
[05:23:11] <bittyx-work> devnill: $('a#thisPart') ?
[05:23:15] <flyblackb> hello
[05:23:18] <impi> xec: so helpful, thank you so much man
[05:23:28] <devnill> cool, thanks

[05:25:19] <acconrad> I'm not sure how to search for this question…I have a div drop down that appears on click…I want to hide it when you click outside of the drop down, but I'm not sure what to search for in how to do that.
[05:25:21] <beasty> hmm i used a span around it
[05:25:24] <beasty> is fixed now
[05:25:26] <xec> bittyx-work: you can se queue to false, in order to do multiple animations at once iirc, and maybe deferreds can help with the "when all the things are done" part
[05:25:35] <dabear> devnill: $("a[href='\\#thispart']")
[05:25:36] <xec> s/se/set
[05:26:04] <acconrad> I tried doing something like $('html').live('click', function { close-it }); but that instantly closes it as soon as it pops up so I need something a bit more elegant
[05:26:15] <bittyx-work> xec: yes, i thought deferreds and particularly .promise() could help, but couldn't find any simple examples of how they work for what i want to do
[05:26:20] <dabear> acconrad: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[05:26:56] <impi> xec: dude...you sorted me out only but gooood
[05:27:03] <ajaxbud> ok how do I share my code from jsfiddle.net
[05:27:14] <xec> bittyx-work: i don't have any experience with this personally, but google found me this: http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/02/merging-jquery-deferreds-and-animate
[05:27:22] <acconrad> dabear: whoa, sweet thanks!
[05:27:39] <xec> impi: did you mean "good" or "god"?
[05:27:50] <flyblackb> ajaxbud i am attempting this too currently
[05:28:06] <impi> good
[05:28:06] <flyblackb> to use jsfiddle
[05:28:09] <ajaxbud> I see. But how can we do it possibly?
[05:28:18] <ajaxbud> flyblackb
[05:28:22] <bittyx-work> xec: awesome, that looks interesting, i'll read it. thanks a lot.
[05:29:22] <dabear> acconrad: then clickoutside should be fine
[05:30:19] <ajaxbud> can somebody tell me how to share this jsfiddle.net link
[05:31:03] <Zogot> theres a share button
[05:31:06] <Zogot> or press ctrl s
[05:31:10] <Zogot> and copy the url
[05:31:21] <ajaxbud> ok another question.. I am trying to upload an image and display it on the same page. More like a profile picture on social networking sites.. COuld somebody suggest me an easy method
[05:31:35] <ajaxbud> http://jsfiddle.net/thefunkystud/N234u/embedded/result/
[05:32:13] <flyblackb> http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/VM8XG/
[05:32:21] <MariusKarthaus> is there a way to detect if a certain css class has been defined in (one of) the css files ?
[05:33:04] <ajaxbud> hi there could somebody look in to this code here http://jsfiddle.net/thefunkystud/N234u/embedded/result/
[05:33:13] <ajaxbud> My .submit is not working
[05:33:14] <dabear> MariusKarthaus: yes, but that would not be easy to implement
[05:33:44] <MariusKarthaus> dabear: how can it be done?
[05:33:44] <ajaxbud> dabear could you please look in to my code and suggest me anything?
[05:33:50] <acconrad> dabear: sweet, downloaded it and its working like a charm
[05:34:25] <ajaxbud> Does anyone have an ajx script using jquery to display an uploaded image from the database?
[05:34:57] <dabear> MariusKarthaus: by iterating over the CSSRuleList of a CSSStylesheet interface.
[05:35:02] <dabear> MariusKarthaus: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/CSSStyleSheet
[05:36:01] <MariusKarthaus> dabear: does that exist in other browsers (IE) ?
[05:37:15] <MariusKarthaus> dabear: never mind found it thank you
[05:38:11] <dabear> MariusKarthaus: what did you find out then?
[05:39:25] <MariusKarthaus> dabear: that the CSSStyleSheet should exist in IE 6+ and is not mozillaonly
[05:40:08] <dabear> MariusKarthaus:  In IE (Win), use rules[] instead of CSSRules[]
[05:40:52] <dabear> ie also has removeRule, while mozilla has deleteRule
[05:40:53] <dabear> lol
[05:41:02] <dabear> IE can't do ANYTHING right :p
[05:41:44] <MariusKarthaus> dabear: that is why i immediately assumed that CSSStyleSheet whould be something i could not use in IE :P
[05:42:20] <EdwardIII> hey
[05:42:33] <EdwardIII> is there some way i can say "after this object has changed, post the form?" http://api.jquery.com/change/
[05:42:40] <EdwardIII> perhaps i can .change().promise(function(){... ?
[05:42:57] <ajaxbud> anybody here
[05:43:01] <dabear> MariusKarthaus: can I ask why you have to check the presence of the rule it self, rather than it's effects? e.g. a rule will say something like color this object red, whereby you would notmally just check if that element is red, rather than checking the cssrule list
[05:43:11] <EdwardIII> i'm doing a submit inside change but it's posting the previously selected value rather than the new one
[05:43:36] <ajaxbud> my code is in the middle of the ocean approaching bermuda triangle,I want rescue team to evacuate it and get it to a safer place
[05:44:06] <dabear> EdwardIII: .change( function(){ this.form.submit(); })
[05:44:12] <beasty> Cork: can i exclude a element ?
[05:44:16] <EdwardIII> dabear: hrm, tried that
[05:44:23] <beasty> for ex i have four .hi's
[05:44:33] <beasty> and i want to exclude the .hi in $(this)
[05:44:49] * EdwardIII jsfiddles
[05:46:15] <EdwardIII> hrm, this doesn't seem to post at all when i put it in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/GB2Hu/
[05:47:02] <EdwardIII> html cleaned up: http://jsfiddle.net/GB2Hu/1/
[05:50:12] <ajaxbud> tcud soebody handle this poor guy here -> http://fixee.org/paste/s9vxhul/#4191
[05:50:36] <ajaxbud> I am trying to upload an image in to my database and then displaying it
[05:50:50] <ajaxbud> but unfortunately when I hit the submit button nothing seems to happen..
[05:51:02] <devnill> How can I select the href from an a tag. I tried $("a#search") but it selects the ID instead.
[05:51:03] <ajaxbud> I am using ajax to do this dynamically
[05:51:15] <devnill> can you put it on pastebin?
[05:51:44] <dabear> devnill: $("a[href='\\#thispart']")
[05:51:45] <muzone> uh oh jsfiddle down
[05:51:54] <devnill> thanks dabear
[05:52:04] <dabear> devnill: are you reading what people are posting to you?
[05:52:13] <dabear> I posted that several minutes ago
[05:52:25] <ajaxbud> dabear can I use your help to fix my code?
[05:53:10] <EdwardIII> https://gist.github.com/1404859
[05:53:23] <ajaxbud> dabear: could I use your help to fix my code
[05:54:00] <devnill> I didn't see it dabear, someone suggested the $(a#thispart)
[05:54:02] <EdwardIII> it's being very naughty - the alert shows the correctly selected value, but the post actually has the originally selected value
[05:54:10] <devnill> I appreciate that you reposted it
[05:55:39] <dabear> EdwardIII: .promise() on a jquery object is only usefull for elements with active animations
[05:55:47] <EdwardIII> right-o
[05:55:58] <dabear> EdwardIII: I see no animations there
[05:56:08] <EdwardIII> assuming the problem is what i think it is, how do i say "perform this action after the change event?"
[05:57:45] <dabear> EdwardIII: http://jsfiddle.net/GB2Hu/5/
[05:57:57] <dabear> the action part of the form has to be defined
[05:59:04] <remysharp> Reading Rey's blog post: http://blog.reybango.com/2010/07/09/not-using-jquery-javascript-templates-youre-really-missing-out/ - anyone want to confirm the template is rendering produces 3 anchor elements (after being normalised), then gets inserted in to a UL which gets normalised again and wraps with <li> elements?
[05:59:04] <bot-t> (177 hours ago) <JonathanNeal> tell remysharp: the htc file solution rewriting the innerHTML kills iframes, so my current work @ http://sandbox.thewikies.com/temp-html5shim/ is actually pretty solid, I think.
[06:02:03] <MW__> Gd day, how to use .live or .delegate or .on ( i don't know which is better) when I make some content visible, but not using 'click' event?
[06:02:36] <MW__> !help
[06:02:51] <MW__> !time
[06:02:55] <dabear> MW__: look at the manual pages at http://api.jquery.com
[06:03:03] <ajaxbud> dabear:
[06:03:09] <ajaxbud> waiting for your help..
[06:03:13] <MW__> Did it already ;)
[06:03:49] <EdwardIII> dabear: any idea how to fix the problem?
[06:04:14] <EdwardIII> dabear: the wrong-option-value-posted problem?
[06:04:16] <dabear> ajaxbud: waiting for you to show me relevant code that fails. I don't wanna debug a shit load of code when it's just parts of it that fails etc
[06:04:24] <dabear> EdwardIII: ?
[06:05:34] <EdwardIII> dabear: the post wasn't a problem locally, only on j.s. fiddle - the issue is that when i hit 'post' it doesn't post the value that's been selected and that triggers the change event
[06:05:45] <EdwardIII> dabear: so i'm guessing i need to trigger the submit event *after* the change rather than during?
[06:06:39] <dabear> EdwardIII: do a demo, and make it post to a php page with var_dump($_GET)
[06:06:57] <dabear> EdwardIII: .change() *is* called after the change has occured
[06:08:13] <EdwardIII> dabear: i have done - same issue: https://gist.github.com/1404859/f2adfb1a276ee973612cb5aa908113e6b3f5f1c5
[06:08:32] <dabear> EdwardIII: ??
[06:08:36] <dabear> that is a paste
[06:08:37] <ajaxbud> dbear: here -> http://fixee.org/paste/rdr7o5h/
[06:08:45] <dabear> I need to look at something I can actually debug
[06:09:27] <ajaxbud> the alert message never really comes up from the code that I have pasted
[06:10:26] <EdwardIII> dabear: wget https://raw.github.com/gist/1404859/aab6a440c1caea55c80bed057256ac7365295dc1/gistfile1.txt && chromium gistfile1.txt # any good for you?
[06:10:58] <dabear> EdwardIII: upload it
[06:11:11] <seutje> hahahaha :')
[06:11:30] <seutje> ajaxbud: does the ajaxSubmit get fired?
[06:11:44] <ajaxbud> I guess the problem lies in tht
[06:11:57] <ajaxbud> seutje:but How do I find it out??
[06:12:03] <seutje> OHAI ericduran!
[06:12:25] <ericduran> seutje: :)
[06:12:27] <seutje> ajaxbud: use ur browser's developer tools
[06:12:48] <seutje> like a "network" tab, if your flavour comes with this
[06:13:07] <ajaxbud> oh I use Chrome
[06:13:11] <seutje> it'll show u a post to that script if it happens
[06:13:16] <ajaxbud> oh ok..
[06:13:45] <ajaxbud> you mean something like firebug?
[06:14:41] <seutje> no, something like dragonfly
[06:14:50] <seutje> I'm jk, yea, something like firebug
[06:14:57] <seutje> it's called "developer tools" in chrome iirc
[06:15:01] <seutje> ctrl+shift+i
[06:15:09] <seutje> or cmd+shift+i if u swing that way
[06:15:22] <Zogot> or ctrl f12 :p
[06:15:26] <Zogot> sorry, just f12
[06:15:39] <seutje> oh shit, that works in chrome now?
[06:15:58] <seutje> when did they add that shortcut key? used to annoy the piss outta me that it didn't pop up on F12
[06:16:17] <Zogot> not sure :p
[06:16:41] <seutje> TIL... :')
[06:18:23] <EdwardIII> dabear: was something to do with manipulating $(this).val() inside the onchange, switched to using PHP to filter out the -cat instead, now jquery just submits the form and it works fine!
[06:18:29] * EdwardIII shrugs
[06:19:22] <ajaxbud> seutje
[06:19:26] <ajaxbud> are you there?
[06:19:46] <ajaxbud> Well it says Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[06:19:47] <ajaxbud> (anonymous function)
[06:20:09] <seutje> ajaxbud: did u forget to add the jQuery library to the page?
[06:20:29] <ajaxbud> I am using jQuery.form
[06:20:41] <ajaxbud> and it is well included in the script
[06:21:00] <helllen> helllo
[06:21:23] <helllen> I have a selector like this '.content li.group div.row .message'
[06:21:37] <helllen> I would like it has exactly this order
[06:21:54] <helllen> and between first element and second element no components
[06:22:20] <helllen> first: class => .content
[06:22:34] <helllen> second: class => li.group
[06:22:49] <helllen> no elements between first and second componts
[06:22:54] <helllen> how could I do that?
[06:22:57] <ablomen> helllen, .class1 > .class2 > .class3
[06:23:59] <ajaxbud> ok..hey..seutje u there?
[06:24:08] <ajaxbud> the problem seems to be like this..
[06:24:20] <Zogot> don't know where i'd be doing a site with css without using that.  I like doing my css based purely off that required hierachy.  Allowing the css names not to be long convoluted combination of 4+ words
[06:24:23] <Zogot> on big sites anyway
[06:24:30] <ajaxbud> hey Zogot
[06:24:35] <ajaxbud> can U address my issue
[06:24:38] <Zogot> I only wish Netbeans auto correct didn't remove the css indentation
[06:24:42] <Zogot> which'/
[06:24:43] <helllen> works
[06:24:47] <helllen> thanks ablomen
[06:25:27] <seutje> Zogot: tried netbeans with scss?
[06:26:00] <ajaxbud> seutje.. My json object is not being handled correctly
[06:26:03] <ajaxbud> I feel so..
[06:26:30] <seutje> how so?
[06:26:30] <ajaxbud> because the error also says that Object #<Object> has no method 'ajaxSubmit'
[06:26:41] <ajaxbud> where my Object datatype is json
[06:27:04] <seutje> uhm, what?
[06:27:25] <ajaxbud> let me show you my entire script code
[06:27:31] <ajaxbud> would that be fine with you?
[06:27:34] <seutje> pretty sure it has nothing to do with ur JSON parsing
[06:27:53] <ajaxbud> oh
[06:27:55] <ajaxbud> http://fixee.org/paste/rdr7o5h/
[06:28:14] <ajaxbud> json is my datatype which holds the info about the image that I upload
[06:28:14] <seutje> if u go $('#foo').bla() and it says "Object #Object has no method bla", it doesn't mean JSON is broken
[06:28:23] <ajaxbud> oh
[06:28:31] <ajaxbud> so what might be the issue seutje?
[06:28:33] <seutje> it just means there is no $.fn.bla
[06:29:00] <ajaxbud> but how could that happen. I have included all the jQuery files required
[06:29:14] <seutje> which probably means jquery.bla.min.js wasn't loaded properly
[06:29:36] <seutje> (where "bla" is the plugin name)
[06:30:16] <seutje> ajaxbud: it could happen coz of a typo in the filename, an external service being down, or about 700 million other reasons
[06:30:20] <ajaxbud> it is loaded properly as I can see the code on Netbeans when ctrl+left click it
[06:30:55] <seutje> that's ur reason for thinking the browsers loads it properly?
[06:31:04] <seutje> u don't test browser related shit... in a browser?
[06:31:15] <ajaxbud> I dont say so..
[06:31:24] <seutje> my head is starting to hurt
[06:31:30] <ajaxbud> but I am pretty sure my script files are well loaded
[06:31:51] <seutje> then there's a mystical issue that causes that method to be non-existent
[06:31:55] <ajaxbud> so where would you want me to debug it right now?
[06:32:17] <ajaxbud> I can see the script files by ctrl+left clicking in Netbeans
[06:32:25] <seutje> open ur dev tools, go to script tab and open the form script thingy
[06:32:44] <ajaxbud> like say it I left click on the used version of jQuery.form.js(which is being used) it shows me the code in the editor
[06:32:53] <seutje> and I can see my belly button when I lift my shirt, this doesn't mean my browser can see my belly button
[06:33:02] <ajaxbud> lol
[06:33:04] <ajaxbud> ok
[06:33:20] <seutje> then I have no clue why that method isn't defined
[06:33:52] <seutje> and will probably remain to have no clue until I can look at an isolated test-case
[06:34:04] <seutje> sorry, good luck!
[06:34:48] <ajaxbud> can I send you the link through fixee?
[06:35:21] <ajaxbud> well the script opens n the browser too
[06:35:37] <ajaxbud> and it shows some uncaught exception at the last line of the jQuery.Form.js
[06:36:06] <thdbased> Anyone have a good tutorial for using jquery for ajax rest requests
[06:36:50] <ajaxbud> seutje u therE?
[06:37:03] <_thumper_> Hey, how do I check an image attribute in an if statement? if ($("#Image").attr("src", "images/test.png"))
[06:37:06] <_thumper_> Would that work?
[06:37:35] <ajpiano> _thumper_: if ( $("#image").attr("src") == "images/test.png") ) { }
[06:37:51] <_thumper_> ajpiano: thanks :)
[06:39:14] <ajaxbud> seutje do you feel there is some problem with my js file?
[06:44:21] <JillesCode> Can anyone help met with $.ajax()? http://pastebin.com/dJ2qawBf my problem is descriped in the paste :)
[06:45:36] <especially-corn> when making a login form is it a bad idea to use ajax?
[06:45:51] <Zogot> missing an s on the success
[06:45:53] <Zogot> line 10?
[06:46:31] <xro> Hi, i would like to hide/show <p> with jquery. my <p> contain ID. Should i set them all as hidden? what jwuery function should i use? --> little code exemple --> http://dpaste.com/663319/
[06:46:59] <JillesCode> Zogot? uhh no that is correct, I want te result of data.php to be the .html() of #results
[06:47:13] <kborchers> JillesCode: see ?ajax and look at the part about success
[06:47:13] <bot-t> JillesCode, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:47:42] <Mkop> xro: $("p").hide() or add a class and do $(".changeDiffInfo").hide() or do $("#changeDiffInfo_1,#changeDiffInfo_2,#changeDiffInfo_3").hide()
[06:47:46] <Zogot> JillesCode, you spelt success wrong :p
[06:48:06] <GilbertCode> JillesCode, you're here?
[06:48:13] <Mkop> especially-corn: what would be wrong with ajax?
[06:48:31] <especially-corn> Mkop, a get request would be bad because you can see the password in the uri
[06:48:46] <Mkop> a) don't GET. b) use https
[06:49:06] <xro> Mkop, should i use hide() to hide all except the one i would like to show or show() function?
[06:49:19] <Mkop> xro: you could do it either way
[06:49:59] <xro> Mkop, and put all the <p> as hidden at the beggining?
[06:50:17] <Mkop> yes
[06:50:37] <_thumper_> How is Jquery remember the state of a div collapsed with .slideToggle()?
[06:50:39] <Mkop> you could also do $(".changeDiffInfo").not("#changeDiffInfo_2").hide()
[06:50:41] <_thumper_> remembering*
[06:51:09] <_thumper_> Also, is there a way to get the state of a div?
[06:51:17] <xro> Mkop, ok i'll try it
[06:51:18] <_thumper_> If it is open or collapsed
[06:53:31] <photosbyme> hope some one can help, I am trying to implement a slider feature into an existing one - I am using bxSlider which uses thumbnails to control the main slides, I wan to also the thumbnails as they overflow  the page content - i guess its like adding a scroller but not with css hope this makes some kind of sense
[06:55:41] <PupenoW> I need to have a little piece of dom hidden away somewhere, a <li> with some things inside it, that would get duplicated and added to an <ol> every time the user clicks a button or something. Essentially a list the user can expand. What would be the best approach to this?
[06:56:26] <photosbyme> trying to do something like this: http://www.alexanderwang.com/lookbook/SPRING-2012/READY-TO-WEAR-WOMENS
[06:57:25] <hazamonzo_> Hey folks. I have a textarea input with a id of foo. If i wanted to add the attribute size="10" to change the width of the textbox would something like this not work? $('#foo').attr("size", "10");
[06:58:04] <Mkop> hazamonzo_: should work
[06:58:29] <hazamonzo_> hmm, must be doing something else wrong then :) Cheers for verifying
[07:00:16] <Mkop> hazamonzo_: post a demo on ?jsfiddle
[07:00:22] <Mkop> ?jsfiddle
[07:00:22] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres
[07:01:02] <hazamonzo_> Mkop: Thats appreciated but this little code snippet is wrapped in some crazy application so it woul really make much sense. I'll get it though. Just wanted to make sure that the basic line was correct
[07:01:15] <xro> Mkop, ohhh, i could work but my hidden <p> take place in the HTML place... so the visible <p> is not at the right place... is there a solution?
[07:01:42] <Mkop> huh? you confused me
[07:02:04] <Mkop> hazamonzo_: sometimes the specific effort of reducing the problem to its smallest components is what helps you figure it out
[07:02:28] <photosbyme> could i bind the class to .scroll( [eventData], handler(eventObject) ) could this work so if someone hovers left it goes left and right if you hover right
[07:02:31] <Mkop> hazamonzo_: the line looks correct, but I haven't tested. if you test on jsfiddle, you might prove me wrong
[07:02:49] <hazamonzo_> Mkop: Ah okay. Will give it a shot
[07:04:31] <Karamon> .toggle() @ PupenoW
[07:04:35] <Karamon> ?.toggle() @ PupenoW
[07:04:35] <bot-t> PupenoW, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[07:08:13] <hazamonzo_> Mkop: The line was good. It just happens that where i placed it was bad so it wasn't being executed (im adding it to a webapp that will fire code at certain points. My code was in the wrong place so it wasn't being fired :) )
[07:09:00] <Mkop> you see? reducing to the smallest component helped!
[07:09:13] <Mkop> it showed that the component itself worked, and the problem was integration
[07:09:21] <hazamonzo_> Mkop: Indeed! I've made a note of it :)
[07:10:03] <photosbyme> ?
[07:10:48] <PupenoW> Karamon: what?
[07:20:18] <photosbyme> ok, think i need to add some kind of slider to it
[07:26:12] <photosbyme> will come back and ask later
[07:45:07] <namero999> hi everyone, I've got a super question. Is it possible some how to get the image data of the rendered viewport?
[07:45:28] <namero999> totally don't care about browser/version/compatibility
[07:46:35] <Butch128> Any idea why just including jquery 1.7.1 in my page causes horizontal scrolling?  Including 1.4.2 does not induce the same behaviour
[07:46:50] <Butch128> sorry, this is in ie6
[07:47:32] <Jon47> namero999 let me get this straight, you want to get a snapshot of the browser as an image?
[07:48:39] <Butch128> 1.6.1 also does not induce this behaviour... only 1.7+
[07:48:54] <namero999> yeah. like, a rendered version of the page, as an image data (to feed ca canvas object)
[07:49:37] <namero999> (to feed a canvas object) *
[07:50:09] <Jon47> Butch128 is jquery the *only* thing you're swapping to observe this?
[07:50:16] <Butch128> Jon47 - yes
[07:50:22] <Butch128> I'll make a test page, sec
[07:50:25] <nwksystems> hi :)
[07:50:31] <ravic> Hi guys, I was looking some cool login validation scipt
[07:50:32] <Jon47> namero999 this stack-exchange thread suggests it's not possible with only javascript: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3316193/take-screenshot-of-browser-via-javascript
[07:50:55] <Jon47> and actually it makes me feel good that it's not possible ;)
[07:51:33] <Jon47> this is probably the best you can do: http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/
[07:51:51] <namero999> Jon47 thanks will check it out. no malicious usage of this tecnique, just some artistical experiments :)
[07:52:09] <Jon47> haha, yeah i'm sure, good luck sir
[07:54:14] <Butch128> jquery 170 -> http://ext-butch.polldev.com/tests/jquery170.html
[07:54:14] <Butch128> jquery164 -> http://ext-butch.polldev.com/tests/jquery164.html
[07:54:31] <Butch128> same page, only difference is 1.6.4 vs 1.7.0 - in IE6, one has a scrollbar, the other doesn't
[07:57:30] <namero999> for example, there are extensions for chrome out there
[07:57:33] <ravic> can someone help me on login scipt?
[07:57:39] <namero999> that allows you to take screenshots
[07:57:54] <namero999> I would guess they use browser apis, and not plain JS?
[08:05:49] <glima> i've been search, but no luck yet. is there a way to have scrollable text lists which scroll on mouse down+move+up?
[08:14:05] <ThunderX> Anyone know if we can print the properties of a plugin?
[08:14:12] <ThunderX> or how to retrieve the plugin object?
[08:14:58] <Eviltwin> What?
[08:17:13] <ThunderX> for example, I assigned $('.ui-sortable').sortable({}); to all objects
[08:17:22] <ThunderX> I want to get the options of what I assigned later
[08:17:38] <ThunderX> I want to know what I had for the stop function property and see if I extend upon it
[08:18:14] <ockham_> hi, i'm trying to extend the jquery-kwicks module, but I'm having a bit of trouble
[08:18:31] <ockham_> maybe someone can help me. i've setup an example at http://jsfiddle.net/y6muQ/
[08:18:35] <Eviltwin> ThunderX: You might be able to get the full settings
[08:18:42] <Eviltwin> ThunderX: Including the defaults you didn't change
[08:18:59] <topriddy> i want to be able to test if a var is an instance of json?
[08:19:18] <ThunderX> Eviltin: How do you suggest I do that? Calling an object with sortable doesn't return the object sortable but just becomes the setter (not the getter)
[08:19:35] <ThunderX> I have a print_r function that prints out an objects properties and values
[08:19:50] <ThunderX> but I'm having trouble accessing getters of DOM objects
[08:20:08] <ThunderX> like if I wanted to see what properties a clickable DOM object has...etc..
[08:20:14] <Eviltwin> ThunderX: Since you're setting the properties
[08:20:22] <Eviltwin> You should be more than capable of tracking them
[08:20:44] <ockham_> i'm using the "sticky" option which, after mouseleave, makes the last selected "kwick" remain expanded
[08:21:08] <ockham_> with defaultKwick, I select the second kwick to be expanded on loading
[08:21:43] <ThunderX> Eviltwin: I'm not the one setting the properties though...like if I call an outside script that executes upon ajax call.
[08:21:52] <ockham_> what I'd like to do now is make that (second) kwick expand after mouse leave, not the last one hovered over.
[08:21:53] <ThunderX> I also want to be able to see what the properties are at a given time
[08:22:06] <ThunderX> in simple, what are the jquery getters of an object?
[08:22:06] <ockham_> i've tried to adapt the code, but so far, to no avail :-(
[08:23:02] <Eviltwin> ThunderX: $('.ui-sortable').data('sortable').options
[08:23:18] <Eviltwin> That's the current settings for the sortable
[08:23:43] <Eviltwin> ThunderX: It should be what you need to make an exact copy
[08:23:45] <ThunderX> thanks Eviltwin, could I do that for anything else as well? Like $('.clickable').data('click') ?
[08:24:07] <ThunderX> for an assigned $('.clickable').click(function(){....});
[08:24:20] <Eviltwin> No, that's not a plugin
[08:24:23] <Eviltwin> It's an event listener
[08:24:36] <DCD> Hello, all.
[08:25:15] <ThunderX> right Eviltwin - and how could I get properties of the event listener, I apologize for hounding on you :P
[08:25:29] <ThunderX> like if I wanted to know all associated functions with keypress(), click(), etc
[08:25:30] <Eviltwin> Why are you trying to get all of these things?
[08:25:40] <Eviltwin> Are you trying to copy it or something?
[08:25:44] <ThunderX> I'm trying to extend an outside 3rd party script
[08:26:09] <ThunderX> like a 3rd party script will attach these events, sortable to the DOM objects in jQuery, I want to do checks, remove some
[08:26:10] <ThunderX> etc
[08:26:19] <DCD> Best/favorite practice - use jquery.validation plugin or a third-party form validator?
[08:26:35] <ThunderX> like if the 3rd party script called click(function() {return TheFunction()});
[08:26:49] <ThunderX> I want to make sure TheFunction() is called, but not called twice
[08:26:55] <ThunderX> and keep the rest of the click events
[08:27:29] <Eviltwin> ThunderX: Take a look at $(".ui-sortable").data() on http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[08:27:38] <Eviltwin> Use Firebug or something
[08:27:40] <Eviltwin> And console.log
[08:28:41] <Eviltwin> The events and stuff are tracked under the jQuery instance
[08:29:07] <Eviltwin> And the instance has a random number appended to it
[08:29:42] <barraponto> can i fire an event only when a checkbox is checked?
[08:29:59] <Eviltwin> ThunderX: In other words, not recommended
[08:30:16] <ThunderX> so just unbind and rebind?
[08:30:20] <barraponto> or should i use change and check for something?
[08:30:47] <Eviltwin> barraponto: Use change and use $(this).is(":checked")
[08:31:02] <jcp_> for some reason my forms won't submit… is it because i'm only validating on click? http://bit.ly/tGE154
[08:31:51] <barraponto> Eviltwin: thanks a lot
[08:32:02] <barraponto> Eviltwin: i was trying with val(), but it didn't work...
[08:32:53] <especially-corn> what's the proper way to send data via jquery
[08:33:06] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ jcp_
[08:33:06] <bot-t> jcp_, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[08:33:11] <Eviltwin> especially-corn: $.ajax
[08:33:20] <especially-corn> data: { name = $('#name').html()} or data: { 'name' = $('#name').html()}
[08:33:46] <DRSK> I'm getting the current selected value in select by var value = jQuery("#select").val(); and then I'm trying to use this value with value, but it's empty it doesn't change. I'm trying to append the value to a link like: return this.href + "&sep=" + value; but it doesn't append anything as a value
[08:33:47] <especially-corn> Eviltwin, do i need to escape the name or not? it works either way on my browser
[08:33:49] <Eviltwin> data: {name: $("#name").html()} or {"name": $("#name").html()}
[08:34:03] <especially-corn> do i need to stringify the name*
[08:34:39] <especially-corn> the official ajax jquery page doesn't say to " " the name
[08:35:06] <Eviltwin> especially-corn: Passing in the object takes care of the stringification
[08:35:25] <especially-corn> Eviltwin, i had problems like this once
[08:35:29] <especially-corn> i had a switch on a value
[08:35:35] <especially-corn> and the cases weren't stringified
[08:35:48] <especially-corn> it worked fine on my browser but i was surprised to see they didn't at school
[08:36:32] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure what that means
[08:36:46] <ThunderX> Eviltwin: I'm trying to get the events of sortable, is there a way to get those?
[08:37:00] <Eviltwin> ThunderX: Events aren't tracked by plugin, they're tracked by element
[08:37:14] <especially-corn> Eviltwin, the action didn't execute in firefox
[08:37:37] <ThunderX> Ok, how can I get the events of an element then? I just want the sortable events
[08:37:47] <especially-corn> i had switch(event) {case trigger1: action...} instead of 'trigger1': action }
[08:37:56] <Eviltwin> ThunderX: You have absolutely no way of being able to tells the difference
[08:38:01] <Eviltwin> especially-corn: That only works with numbers
[08:38:11] <photosbyme> trying to use jquery to add an Id value to a div that is created by a plugin, so far I have tried this $('.bx-pager').attr('id', 'thumbs');
[08:38:11] <Eviltwin> If you're rrying to match a string you need to use a string
[08:38:21] <especially-corn> thanks
[08:38:40] <ThunderX> k...
[08:49:56] <ockham_> ockham_: can anyone help me pls? ^^^
[08:54:00] <BillCriswell> ockham_: Ask.
[08:59:01] <photosbyme> can i ask again: trying to use jquery to add an Id value to a div that is created by a plugin, so far I have tried this $('.bx-pager').attr('id', 'thumbs');
[08:59:32] <ockham_> BillCriswell: thx! well, see http://jsfiddle.net/y6muQ/1/
[09:00:12] <ockham_> i can set the second tab to be expanded on load, but i can't make it expand again when i mouse-leave the area
[09:00:33] <Pookz> Can I append hidden input fields to a form then submit through post?
[09:01:08] <Eviltwin> Prot: Yes
[09:02:33] <ockham_> though i'm trying to do that with some lines of code, see after if (o.toDefault)
[09:02:58] <Eviltwin> photosbyme: http://jsfiddle.net/utANE/
[09:04:09] <photosbyme> thank you, Eviltwin
[09:04:14] <sadmicrowave> hey everyone!
[09:04:26] <Eviltwin> photosbyme: The first part sets the ID, the second part shows you it was set
[09:04:59] <amirite> how do I unbind a specific function?
[09:05:15] <amirite> i.e. not unbind all attached callbacks, just a single one
[09:05:24] <Eviltwin> .bind("click",myFunction) -> .unbind("click",myFunction)
[09:06:26] <sadmicrowave> I'm needing some assistance optimizing this code.  I need to find the height of a string and do a condition based on the outcome but there HAS to be a better way of doing this. http://jsfiddle.net/dfvSt/ any thoughts?
[09:07:03] <sadmicrowave> ^sorry, do an action based on a condition*
[09:07:30] <Eviltwin> The height of a string?
[09:07:38] <sadmicrowave> indeed
[09:07:39] <photosbyme> nope didin't work, this s*** plugin I am using : http://bxslider.com/examples/thumbnails-pager-method-2
[09:07:40] <Eviltwin> Strings don't have heights
[09:07:52] <sadmicrowave> Eviltwin, correct, which is why I have to put it in the DOM first
[09:08:23] <Eviltwin> photosbyme: I can assure you that .attr("id","foo") sets the ID to foo
[09:09:02] <photosbyme> its the plugin, it seems to strip it am using firebug to check and its not there :(
[09:11:17] <Eviltwin> photosbyme: Then maybe get a better plugin?
[09:12:06] <photosbyme> lol, its the only one that i can find that come close to doing this : http://www.alexanderwang.com/lookbook/SPRING-2012/READY-TO-WEAR-WOMENS
[09:12:40] <photosbyme> any suggestions and i'll be on it like white on rice!
[09:13:09] <Eviltwin> I don't see anything in this plugin where it removes IDs
[09:13:16] <slyisarenko-ilya> join #jquery-dev
[09:14:12] <ThunderX> Eviltwin: you there?
[09:14:22] <photosbyme> Eviltwin: the .bx-pager class is what I am trying to add the Id to, if I can do that maybe I can get the thumbnails to scroll
[09:14:28] <ThunderX> Anyone know how I can store a reference to a jQuery object?
[09:14:42] <ThunderX> I tried data('jobj', jQuery(this)) but it's not working
[09:15:01] <Eviltwin> ThunderX: Store it with what and where?
[09:15:08] <ThunderX> a reference in a DOM object
[09:15:15] <Whirl3d> $(element).data(""job",$(this)) should work
[09:15:25] <Whirl3d> *"job"
[09:15:30] <ThunderX> like for example when a dropable element is placed I want a perm reference to ui.draggable
[09:15:35] <ThunderX> hmm I'll try again
[09:16:16] <Eviltwin> .data isn't a replacement for var
[09:17:33] <ThunderX> oh, how should I reference it then?
[09:17:43] <ThunderX> I guess I can create IDs for both
[09:17:53] <Eviltwin> That entirely depends on the specifics of what you're trying to do
[09:17:57] <Eviltwin> And you haven't given us those specifics
[09:19:12] <ThunderX> I'm working with draggable and droppable
[09:19:27] <ThunderX> Upon droppable I want to add actionable items, like onclick behavior
[09:19:40] <ThunderX> I want that onclick behavior to be able to reference the original ui.draggable element
[09:19:51] <ryanneufeld> ?on @ ThunderX
[09:19:52] <bot-t> ThunderX, The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:20:01] <Eviltwin> Do you have code we can see?
[09:20:14] <ryanneufeld> use the delegate pattern
[09:21:13] <Whirl3d> which is better:    var blnk=val==undefined||val==""||val==deflt;   or   var blnk=val===undefined||val==""||val==deflt?true:false;
[09:21:51] <sadmicrowave> ThunderX, can you not bind on the already created 'drop' event from the droppable ui?
[09:22:42] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: There's no difference
[09:23:06] <Eviltwin> The second just wastes CPU time
[09:23:13] <sadmicrowave> i.e. $('select').droppable({drop: function(event,ui){ alert('I just dropped it!'); });
[09:23:21] <Eviltwin> Although you probably want more ==='s and less =='s
[09:23:27] <Eviltwin> Exact comparison
[09:23:35] <ThunderX> Thanks bot-t
[09:23:35] <Eviltwin> (Which is also faster)
[09:23:35] <bot-t> ThunderX, I'm a bot you know..
[09:23:53] <especially-corn> how can i make a clickHandler for multiple functions
[09:23:59] <ThunderX> sadmicrowave, Eviltwin: - I worked around it
[09:24:01] <Eviltwin> especially-corn: ?
[09:24:01] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, thx.
[09:24:13] <ThunderX> I was trying to store the original ui.draggable DOM object, but I just set unique IDs them
[09:24:37] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[09:24:39] <especially-corn> Eviltwin, you know the action you define on click for something, i want that to be performed even if i press enter, so i need a way to store that procedure instead of defining it every time
[09:24:42] <Eviltwin> IDs disgust me
[09:24:56] <Eviltwin> especially-corn: It's callde a function
[09:24:58] <Eviltwin> called*
[09:25:01] <Eviltwin> A named function
[09:25:15] <especially-corn> so how can i do it?
[09:25:17] <Eviltwin> like function myClickOrKeyPressHandler(event) {... }
[09:25:35] <Eviltwin> $("myselector").click(myClickOrKeyPressHandler)
[09:25:42] <Eviltwin> $("myotherselector").keypress(myClickOrKeyPressHandler)
[09:25:58] <zalabim> hi guys, anyone mind taking a look and tell me what i'm doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/zeWu7/ (just 3 lines)
[09:26:07] <Whirl3d> if I am trying to do live input field validation, would this be a good time to use a deferred object (I'm trying to learn deferreds/promises and when to use them)
[09:26:17] <ajpiano> or $("myselector").on("keypress click", fn);
[09:26:28] <Eviltwin> If it's the same for both, yes
[09:27:07] <Eviltwin> zalabim: A lot
[09:27:18] <natrixnatrix89> I'm going through how jquery animate() works.. and it looks like it is using setInterval with 13 miliseconds long interval.. Does anyone know why exactly 13?
[09:27:44] <Eviltwin> zalabim: http://jsfiddle.net/zeWu7/1/
[09:27:57] <ajpiano> natrixnatrix89: typically the smallest timing interval that browsers actually honour is 13ms
[09:28:05] <ajpiano> ?g john resig accuracy of javascript timers
[09:28:06] <bot-t> ajpiano, John Resig - Accuracy of JavaScript Time - http://ejohn.org/blog/accuracy-of-javascript-time/
[09:28:16] <natrixnatrix89> thank you
[09:28:31] <Eviltwin> And 13 still means ~76 / sec
[09:28:39] <Eviltwin> Movies are typically 24 frames / sec
[09:28:42] <zalabim> Eviltwin: wow, that was really quick
[09:28:45] <Eviltwin> Up to 30
[09:29:26] <especially-corn> Eviltwin, $("#send").click(performAjax()); doesn't work
[09:30:17] <especially-corn> Eviltwin, it performs the action, it doesn't wait like i would expect it to
[09:30:51] <ajpiano> especially-corn: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide32
[09:31:00] <Eviltwin> I need to bookmark that
[09:31:06] <Eviltwin> That's the second time in two days someone has done that
[09:31:21] <natrixnatrix89> ajpiano: can you explain me how exactly the animate works..
[09:31:21] <natrixnatrix89> I mean what happens in case when the pc is too slow to render a new frame every 13ms.. then it reaches the next ticks, but movements that would have to be made now have to be stacked in a huge queue? But jquery somehow manages to jump to the appropriate frames.. and if it is said that the animation is only 600 ms, then it is.. even with some frames of it skipped.. Do you know how does it do that? does it calculate the delta of time or what?
[09:31:35] <ajpiano> i cannot explain that
[09:31:39] <ajpiano> gnarf: might be able to
[09:32:16] <especially-corn> ajpiano, you're most certainly right! thank you
[09:32:18] <natrixnatrix89> I just want to understand what would be the best way if I wanted to make some animations myself.. with sprites..
[09:32:27] <zalabim> Eviltwin: why this versoin won't work? What am I missing? http://jsfiddle.net/zeWu7/2/ (did a little update) Still think your's looks cleaner
[09:34:08] <Eviltwin> natrixnatrix89: I believe it uses (new Date).getTime()
[09:34:20] <Eviltwin> natrixnatrix89: To check to see how much wall clock time has actually passed
[09:34:21] <Zzaichik> zalabim: you're missing the jQuery in front of the (this).stop()
[09:34:42] <zalabim> Eviltwin: Oh, that was dumb lol
[09:34:59] <zalabim> Eviltwin: It's basically the same besides that right?
[09:35:05] <natrixnatrix89> hmm gotta search
[09:35:28] <Eviltwin> zalabim: Try it and find out
[09:36:06] <Eviltwin> natrixnatrix89: Look for occurrences of jQuery.now()
[09:36:17] <Eviltwin> Or maybe .now()
[09:36:17] <natrixnatrix89> yes
[09:36:21] <natrixnatrix89> I'm searching
[09:36:22] <natrixnatrix89> now
[09:36:38] <Zzaichik> zalabim: I'm not Eviltwin but I think it looks fairly straight forward. And why not just use ' $ ' instead of 'jQuery'?
[09:36:40] <zalabim> Eviltwin: I meant the way the code was written, are there any signifcant differences between doing that init thing?
[09:36:47] <Eviltwin> Which is used by createFxNow
[09:36:52] <gnarf> natrixnatrix89: it actually just calculates where it should be based on the start time and the end time
[09:37:15] <natrixnatrix89> hmm. right.. so it's convenient..
[09:37:22] <gnarf> it doesn't ever rely on a frame every interval, it just draws it where it should be when it gets a frame
[09:37:24] <Eviltwin> zalabim: Depends on what you're trying to do
[09:37:33] <zalabim> Zzaichik: Oh I got confused, sorry. I was using jQuery because of the no conflict thing, but now i'll use the dollar ;)
[09:37:55] <natrixnatrix89> but the setInterval.. doesn't it create an action to be created every 13ms? or it just makes browser execute it as fast as it can?
[09:38:23] <natrixnatrix89> so depending on the code complexity ticks in 600ms would vary?
[09:39:11] <Eviltwin> natrixnatrix89: If the code takes more than 13ms to run, the function will be executed more than 13ms apart
[09:39:26] <natrixnatrix89> oh.. that's exactly what I wanted to know
[09:39:28] <natrixnatrix89> thanks
[09:39:35] <zalabim> I just want a nice hover effect
[09:39:56] <Eviltwin> This is an example I made to explain why async: false AJAX can be bad
[09:40:06] <Eviltwin> This is async: true (by default) http://jsfiddle.net/g9dT5/
[09:40:17] <Eviltwin> This is aync: false http://jsfiddle.net/FStR5/
[09:40:22] <Eviltwin> Look what happens in the second one
[09:41:08] <natrixnatrix89> it doesn't work as intended..
[09:41:12] <natrixnatrix89> it waits for the page to load..
[09:41:24] <Eviltwin> Right
[09:41:25] <natrixnatrix89> right?
[09:41:31] <Eviltwin> In fact the browser window might even freeze
[09:41:37] <natrixnatrix89> yeah
[09:41:49] <Eviltwin> Effectively that function waits for 3 seconds
[09:41:52] <Eviltwin> And meanwhile nothing else can run
[09:41:55] <_thumper_> Hey, is this valid, it keeps hanging my code
[09:41:59] <_thumper_> $.cookie("ToggleStatus", "0");
[09:42:04] <natrixnatrix89> but that's basically the definition of synchronous load
[09:42:18] <ryanneufeld> _thumper_: do you have the jquery cookie plugin?
[09:42:20] <Eviltwin> Yes but what some people fail to understans
[09:42:24] <Eviltwin> understand*
[09:42:31] <Eviltwin> Is that JavaScript is single-threaded
[09:42:49] <Eviltwin> When you setTimeout or setInterval that's scheduling stuff to be done later when your functions have all returned
[09:42:53] <Eviltwin> In the same thread
[09:43:06] <_thumper_> ryanneufeld, no didn't know I needed one, thanks
[09:43:25] <Eviltwin> You can kind of think of it as user-level threading
[09:43:28] <ryanneufeld> _thumper_: $.cookie doesn't just magically appear
[09:43:40] <Eviltwin> But it's more like a run-loop
[09:43:56] <_thumper_> ryanneufeld, I know I thought it was defined in the main library
[09:44:13] <t0th> hi
[09:44:18] <ryanneufeld> _thumper_: ah
[09:44:24] <t0th> i have a click event in a class="remover"
[09:44:38] <t0th> but some times quen i click the event are triggered 2 times..
[09:44:40] <t0th> why?
[09:45:04] <Eviltwin> t0th: Without seeing your code, we can't tell you exactly
[09:45:09] <Eviltwin> Except that perhaps you've bound it twice
[09:45:26] <ryanneufeld> _thumper_: http://plugins.jquery.com/files/jquery.cookie.js__1.txt try that one maybe
[09:45:29] <Zzaichik> zalabim: cool. You could just as easily use .hover()
[09:46:21] <gho5t> is there a reason why my selector would find an element but not be able to change its css properties or hide it? alert($('#addForm').length); <-- alerts 1. $('#addForm')hide(); <!-- doesn't work
[09:46:28] <gho5t> should be .hide()
[09:46:48] <ryanneufeld> _thumper_: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/VD2Gz/ we use that one, which apparently is about 4 years old
[09:46:54] <Eviltwin> Do you have more than one element with that ID?
[09:46:57] <t0th> [Eviltwin]: this problem
[09:47:04] <t0th> one click fire many times
[09:47:09] <ryanneufeld> _thumper_: that one I know works, the newer one, i have not tested
[09:47:11] <gho5t> no because it's alerting "1"
[09:47:29] <ryanneufeld> $('#addForm').hide();
[09:47:38] <ryanneufeld> gho5t: you need a dot in there
[09:47:41] <Eviltwin> gho5t: No, $("#foo") will always return 0 or 1
[09:47:53] <Eviltwin> Regardless of whether or not there are 20 of them
[09:48:02] <Eviltwin> Because IDs are *supposed* to be unique
[09:48:12] <gho5t> eve: i put length
[09:48:16] <gho5t> ok
[09:48:21] <gho5t> but you meant with .length right
[09:48:42] <Eviltwin> gho5t: http://jsfiddle.net/rhmP7/
[09:48:44] <gho5t> you're right. i switched to be a class and it worked
[09:48:54] <gho5t> have another one there somewhere. thanks
[09:49:21] <gho5t> Eviltwin: I like the example though. : p funny
[09:51:13] <_thumper_> ryanneufeld: The newer one worked perfectly :) Thanks alot!
[09:51:55] <ryanneufeld> np
[09:52:54] <DobreJoe> how do I select an input tag with a specified name? i.e. <input name="foo" />
[09:53:16] <Eviltwin> $("input[name=foo]")
[09:53:16] <Zzaichik> DobreJoe: You know CSS, yes?
[09:53:20] <Mkop> DobreJoe: $("input[name='foo']")
[09:53:35] <DobreJoe> yes, i'm light headed. Thanks.
[09:59:26] <innociv_> What javascript IDE do you guys use?

[10:03:19] <appl3s> hello
[10:03:54] <Zzaichik> jsfiddle is awesome, I've heard good things about WebStorm? I think that's what it's called
[10:04:25] <Eviltwin> I don't actually use jsFiddle as my IDE, I generally use emacs (or vi) as everything
[10:04:43] <Zzaichik> I mainly use VIM or TextMate
[10:04:59] <Zzaichik> but jsFiddle is still awesome. :)
[10:05:09] <Eviltwin> jsFiddle is awesome
[10:05:15] <Eviltwin> Which is why we plug it so hard here
[10:05:56] <tfitts> can anyone recommend a good way to add items to the browser history based on ajax calls?
[10:06:14] <Eviltwin> tfitts: You can't unless the browser has pushState

[10:07:53] <lduros> does anybody know of a search engine that would allow to search the html source code of pages rather than the actual textual content?
[10:08:49] <oojacoboo> lduros: don't all search that as well and just filter it out ;)
[10:11:02] <Eviltwin> lduros: Unfortunately no
[10:11:09] <Eviltwin> lduros: code.google.com searches code
[10:11:19] <Eviltwin> But I think it only searches the code they host
[10:12:34] <necromancer> is there a way to select when a single element has loaded?
[10:12:56] <necromancer> like there's $(document).ready which fires when the whole page loaded. but is there a .ready()-like callback for single elements?
[10:13:09] <Eviltwin> necromancer: What would it tell you?
[10:13:21] <Eviltwin> When they're added to the DOM?
[10:13:26] <lduros> Eviltwin: it searches code but not html source of pages online
[10:13:31] <Eviltwin> Right
[10:13:32] <necromancer> yeah when the element loads
[10:13:54] <Eviltwin> necromancer: Unfortunately, this only exists in some very recent browsers
[10:13:56] <necromancer> Eviltwin: like i want to do $('#comments').ready(function() { alert("comments loaded"); });
[10:14:03] <necromancer> oh so it does exist
[10:14:04] <necromancer> cool
[10:14:09] <Eviltwin> Not all browsers
[10:14:10] <necromancer> Eviltwin: where can i find more info?
[10:14:26] <Eviltwin> I think the event is called DOMSubtreeModified
[10:15:51] <necromancer> Eviltwin: apparently that's deprecated according to https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/DOM_event_reference
[10:15:59] <necromancer> i wonder if DOMNodeInserted is its replacement?
[10:16:14] <NoiseEee> necromancer: what element
[10:16:18] <shodan45> is it true that exceptions don't get logged to the console when inside an event handler?
[10:16:44] <necromancer> NoiseEee: it's a <div> but does it matter? what can't i do this with?
[10:17:27] <NoiseEee> necromancer: well some elements have their own loaded event, like images.
[10:17:45] <necromancer> NoiseEee: oh wow what'st hat one called?
[10:17:48] <necromancer> that could be very useful
[10:17:54] <necromancer> DOMContentLoadeD?
[10:18:20] <shodan45> $( undef_var ).jqGrid( ... ); called inside an event handler just silently stops JS execution...?
[10:18:29] <snover> necromancer: ALL of the DOM mutation events were deprecated. There is work in progress to create new ones that have better performance.
[10:19:20] <necromancer> snover: oh...ok then. so i guess it's not a good idea to make sites that use them
[10:23:11] <tfitts> does anyone use any of these ajax history plugins that use the hashchange event?
[10:23:14] <pillar_> hello, I'm using jquery to do ajax call, but for some reason the response has different charset than my pages, as the scandinavic letters are not displayed correctly. If I do a direct call through web browser, the content is displayed correcly
[10:23:39] <pillar_> is there a way to force some charset or do I need to do some charset conversion?
[10:24:24] <pillar_> tfitts: I'm using history.js
[10:24:47] <Eviltwin> tfitts: We just ended up coding our own
[10:24:52] <Eviltwin> It wasn't too hard
[10:25:50] <tfitts> are they difficult to use?  for each ajax request I make I already have a fixed url that will load the same content.

[10:30:22] <Syco54645_work> does anyone know where i can find the api for iscroll?
[10:33:42] <skh_> hi all.. can someone remind me:  I am using the normal dot notation to address an object, but one of them ends with a digit (eg. Someobj.settings.setting-1.test).  With that digit, it keeps giving me an error.. what's the proper way?
[10:34:19] <Eviltwin> skh_: Someobj.settings['setting-1'].test
[10:34:45] <shodan45> skh_: and it isn't the digit, it's the "-"
[10:35:22] <skh_> Thanks to both!
[10:35:46] <Eviltwin> Someobj.settings.setting-1.test would be parsed as (Someobj.settings.setting) - (1.test)
[10:35:48] <cuci> evening folks! I'm trying to get a validate woking for my form like so: https://gist.github.com/1405877, but it fails with: Unknown pseudo class   [id='new_pacient'] input:file
[10:35:58] <cuci> any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
[10:38:16] <necromancer> cuci: have you tried just pacient_cnp:?
[10:38:57] <necromancer> i usually don't need to do 'name_of_element': "required", just name_of_element: "required"
[10:39:22] <cuci> ah remove the quotes also?
[10:39:23] <Eviltwin> necromancer: You know that if foo: {...} works, "foo": {...} *always* work
[10:39:27] <Eviltwin> Not necssarily the other way around though
[10:39:37] <Eviltwin> works*
[10:40:09] <necromancer> ok
[10:40:17] <cuci> necromancer: same error without the quotes and the # also
[10:40:54] <necromancer> cuci: i'm assuming "pacient_cnp" is an input name, not an id, right?
[10:41:24] <necromancer> considering you're using Rails (judging by your Sprockets requires), it should be called something like "object[attribute]"
[10:41:39] <necromancer> pretty sure validate selects input names
[10:41:44] <necromancer> rather than IDs
[10:41:52] <cuci> necromancer: I'm new to this :), let me check
[10:41:57] <paul_uk> hey all, anyone using IE with labjs, I keep on getting these intermittent errors: http://pastie.org/2939977

[10:42:31] <m1chael> im trying to set the jquery masonry selector to:'body > #container > ul > li # but it doesnt seem to work
[10:42:41] <necromancer> cuci: most of the time you want to favor ids over names, since they are unique, but in this case you're scoped by the <form> so the input names kinda have to be unique (or else you'll end up with strange data being sent via the form)
[10:43:30] <cuci> necromancer: you where right! pacient[cnp] fixed it!
[10:43:34] <cuci> thank you!
[10:43:42] <cuci> but with quotes around
[10:45:08] <necromancer> right
[11:09:25] <sky> I have a mouseleave event being fired that I dont want. I have a wrapper div, and an absolute position element inside that is outside the wrapper divs dimensions
[11:09:53] <sky> shouldnt mouseleave not fire when im still in the child element (the absolute positioned one)
[11:10:04] <sky> the even fires as soon as I leave the wrappers bounding box
[11:11:17] <Eviltwin> sky: Can you make a jsFiddle example of your problem?
[11:11:28] <sky> I can link to a live example
[11:11:37] <sky> never used jsfiddle
[11:12:05] <sky> Eviltwin: is this expected behavior?
[11:12:28] <Eviltwin> I didn't entirely grasp what you were saying so I'd like to see
[11:14:39] <sky> does the mouseleave event get tied to the bounding box of the element its bound to?
[11:15:01] <sky> cause it seems that way... so if a child element is position absolute and is out of the parent bounding box, the event fires
[11:16:04] <Jon47> sky, how could it be any *other* way?
[11:16:18] <sky> makes sense... I thought it was magic :D
[11:16:30] <sky> this is all sorta broken, unfortunately
[11:16:33] <tomasm-> hi, i have several DOM objects that need a function added to it, but each object implements the same function a bit differently.... I tired assigning $('#id').funcName = function() { ... }; , but then when I call it, it's still undefined. any ideas?
[11:17:02] <sky> Jon47: so how can I ensure the child(absolute) element stays visible if the mouse is over it
[11:17:31] <sky> do I need to write a function or is there something I can use
[11:17:42] <Jon47> i'm not sure i understand the problem, can you write a fiddle
[11:18:06] <tomasm-> hmmm, or maybe an event handler! =)
[11:19:23] <sky> the problem is so nasty I dare not describe it
[11:19:36] <sky> its a combination of image map, javascript swapping of images, and more.
[11:19:43] <sky> I dont even understand it.

[11:20:53] <sky> jdfiddles neat
[11:21:17] <Eviltwin> mythril: Not really
[11:21:22] <Eviltwin> mythril: Why?
[11:22:02] <Eviltwin> sky: If you want to pretend like they're separate, you can do: http://jsfiddle.net/WsFcn/
[11:22:38] <Eviltwin> But this can cause some weird behavior: http://jsfiddle.net/ZbjBf/
[11:23:26] <Eviltwin> Like move the mouse into the blue on then up to the red then out to the right
[11:23:48] <sadmicrowave> noop question.  If I have: var $this = $('#selector'); is the following equal to the non-jquery-initialized version? var this = "<div id='selector'>";
[11:23:52] <sadmicrowave> noob^
[11:24:14] <mythril> Eviltwin: because I would like to remove some elements before the last frame of completion, as they cause a visible flicker in what I'm doing
[11:24:19] <skh_> How can I check if an object property exists?  For example if(Someobj.setting1.settings){Someobh.setting1.settings.name = "Alice";}
[11:24:44] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave: What do you mean
[11:24:54] <Eviltwin> The first thing fetches an existing element
[11:25:33] <sadmicrowave> Eviltwin, I want to use .parentNode rather than .parent().  In order to do this I need a non-initialized $this variable
[11:25:35] <Eviltwin> skh_: That checks if Someobj.setting1.settings exists
[11:25:41] <Eviltwin> But assumes Someobj.setting1 exists
[11:25:48] <Eviltwin> If Someobj.setting1 doesn't exist, it causes an exception
[11:26:07] <Eviltwin> $this[0] is the actual first DOM element in the collection
[11:26:14] <skh_> Eviltwin, yes, that's my problem.. is there a one-liner to make sure they all exist?  Or do I have to go through it
[11:26:24] <Eviltwin> skh_: Have to go through it, sorry
[11:26:30] <sadmicrowave> skh_, if( Someobj && Someobj.setting1 && Someobj.setting1.settings )
[11:26:35] <skh_> thanks
[11:26:39] <Eviltwin> skh_: Not that first one
[11:26:47] <Eviltwin> That will explode if it doesn't exist
[11:27:23] <sadmicrowave> well, in either case, back to my question
[11:27:25] <sadmicrowave> ...
[11:28:01] <hlveheart> question guys.
[11:28:11] <Eviltwin> sadmicrowave: $("#foo").parent() is roughly equivalent to $($("#foo")[0].parentNode)
[11:28:43] <hlveheart> ;P. Is it possible to create CSS properties in jQuery/JS?
[11:28:50] <hlveheart> Or is that just a stupid question?
[11:28:56] <Eviltwin> hlveheart: What do you mean?
[11:28:57] <ajpiano> ?g jquery.rule flesler @ hlveheart
[11:28:58] <bot-t> hlveheart, Ariel Flesler: jQuery.Rule - http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/11/jqueryrule.html
[11:29:24] <hlveheart> Reading that now, ajpiano. But before I do, do you know what I'm trying to do? :P
[11:29:54] <ajpiano> i linked you to that plugin based on my assumptino of what you were trying to do based on your question
[11:29:57] <mgoeppner> hlveheart: well you never told us what you were tryingto do :P
[11:30:00] <hlveheart> ;P
[11:30:04] <hlveheart> I was typing it.
[11:30:06] <ajpiano> which was to "create css properties in JS"
[11:30:21] <ajpiano> which you can, given the fact that style elements can be created on the fly
[11:30:28] <hlveheart> Basically because Firefox has no idea what to do with Filter, or Background CSS properties, I was going to create the filter and css properties so I wouldn't get the 1,000 broken css warnings.
[11:30:37] <ajpiano> oh
[11:30:38] <ajpiano> that
[11:30:44] <ajpiano> that sounds decidedly less possible
[11:30:47] <kba> I want to submit a form using AJAX. I remember there's some easy way to do it so I won't have to create the querystring myself
[11:30:51] <hlveheart> D'awh.
[11:31:01] <ajpiano> if people could just monkey-patch css features into browsers via JS, i don't think we'd have been battling IE all these years
[11:31:02] <mgoeppner> kba: serialize
[11:31:22] <kba> mgoeppner: Exactly, thank you!
[11:31:32] <mgoeppner> kba: no problem!
[11:31:34] <hlveheart> well, yes and no. I don't care if the property does anything but null it. Just so firefox doesn't freak out.
[11:32:07] <tomasm-> anyone know what the heck an 'invalid label' error means when calling trigger()? It's for a custom event handler ('showPart')
[11:32:54] <mgoeppner> tomasm-: you have the code on a fiddle?
[11:33:11] <hlveheart> so it's just not possible, eh.
[11:33:44] <ajpiano> hlveheart: the reccomendation i'm seeing seems to be "use conditional IE stylesheets that only have the filter rules in them"
[11:33:51] <ajpiano> which is probably not the answer you were looking for
[11:34:07] <hlveheart> it would require conditional javascripts, as the CSS is being added by a carousel.
[11:34:09] <hlveheart> Bleh
[11:34:19] <hlveheart> I was just hoping to avoid recoding it.
[11:34:32] <xiam> tomasm-: chances are you're missing a comma inside some js object. { label: value }
[11:34:39] <ajpiano> so the carousel has filter: rules inside of the CSS file they provide you with
[11:34:42] <wjfoz> Hi
[11:34:44] <wjfoz> How could I retrieve all of them?
[11:34:44] <keybo> if im using a for loop and for each iteration of the loop i want to create an element how do i add the index of the iteration into the id of the element i am creating?
[11:34:46] <wjfoz> ops
[11:34:48] <wjfoz> sorry
[11:35:01] <wjfoz> Hi people, I have a webpage with many combobox and I would like to replace the content of all. How could I retrieve all of them? They have little diferents ids, like "select#med_1 option", "select#med_2 option", "select#med_n option"...
[11:35:51] <keybo> for example for ( i=0; i < 4; i++ ) { $(elementcontainer).append(element id=index) }  as a rough example ofwhat I want to achieve
[11:35:54] <hlveheart> ajpiano - do you think I'm on to something if I play with CSSHooks at all?
[11:36:17] <mgoeppner> keybo: uhh just cat the i onto the id?
[11:36:35] <ajpiano> hlveheart: probably not
[11:36:57] <hlveheart> This is a sad, sad day. I just figured there _had_ to be a way.
[11:37:07] <ajpiano> hlveheart: if there's a stylesheet being loaded and errors are being thrown up by the browser, "after JS has an opportunity to execute" is probably way too late to fuck with the stylesheet there
[11:37:09] <mgoeppner> $(elementcontainer).attr("id", i)
[11:37:16] <keybo> cheers :P
[11:37:18] <keybo> makes sense :P
[11:37:51] <ajpiano> hlveheart: for what it's worth, the "errors" in the error console are usually ignorable
[11:38:11] <hlveheart> not if they're happening every 20ms on loop.
[11:38:13] <hlveheart> lol.
[11:38:27] <hlveheart> quite a performance issue I have on my hands.
[11:38:40] <ajpiano> the errors themselves are a perforamnce issue?
[11:38:55] <mgoeppner> hlveheart: what are you trying to do again? I d/c'ed when you were describing it I think
[11:39:08] <ajpiano> hlveheart: every single page i'm looking at about this problem says "use conditional comments"
[11:39:27] <hlveheart> mgoeppner - trying to create a css property for filter, and background to make firefox not freak out with my carouself.
[11:39:31] <ajpiano> or "ignore it"
[11:39:41] <mgoeppner> ah
[11:40:14] <tomasm-> wait, i forgot the event object in the function parameter list for the binding
[11:42:01] <mgoeppner> hlveheart: yeah that sounds like a job for conditional comments.
[11:42:09] <mgoeppner> or put the css in a class
[11:42:12] <sky> Eviltwin: thanks for the help and intro to jsfiddle... i think some of the other js in the page was screwing it up
[11:42:24] <mgoeppner> and apply that class to elements as needed
[11:43:11] <foRei> Hey, any ideas why I cannot use .corner("buttom") on a .tabs(); div? - The corners just disappear
[11:43:29] <mgoeppner> foRei: do you mean bottom?
[11:43:35] <murosai> if i load my jquery from external javascript file how can i load the jquery library in the file im loading?
[11:43:37] <foRei> yep sorry, thats what it says in the code =)
[11:43:45] <murosai> i mean load my jquery application
[11:43:49] <mgoeppner> foRei: just checking
[11:44:06] <murosai> or is it enough if i load the jquery in the main html?
[11:44:26] <sanjayb> murosai: you may have to paste code to clarify what you mean, but sounds like just main html should be fine.
[11:44:37] <tomasm-> oh god, i ended a line with a ':' instead of a ';'
[11:44:41] <tomasm-> invalid label
[11:44:42] <tomasm-> wtf
[11:46:05] <mgoeppner> tomasm-: it happens.
[11:46:27] <tomasm-> well now i know what it means
[11:46:46] <andrew9183> hey guys, if i show a little submenu when i click, how can i have the submenu disappear when i click anywhere else on the page ?
[11:47:04] <andrew9183> the user has to click an icon for the submenu to show
[11:47:04] <mgoeppner> andrew9183:
[11:47:11] <mgoeppner> oops
[11:47:32] <mgoeppner> andrew9183: $(elem).blur(function(){//dosomething});
[11:47:40] <wjfoz> Hi people, I have some trouble to select a set of elements based on their ids. Can anyone help me?
[11:47:43] <andrew9183> i know i could do it a bad way by attaching a class and then hide it on mousedown but bleh
[11:48:35] <tomasm-> andrew9183, why not have it hide on blur? seems a bit more typical
[11:48:59] <tomasm-> wjfoz, only if you give an example/details
[11:49:04] <wjfoz> ok
[11:49:07] <andrew9183> ah okay, let me give it a shot
[11:49:09] <andrew9183> thanks for the advice guys
[11:49:14] <mgoeppner> np
[11:49:32] <wjfoz> I have a webpage with many combobox and I would like to replace the content of all
[11:49:42] <tomasm-> andrew9183, and easier to show it on hover anyway.... i think jquery's hover() will accept two functions, for the mouseover and mouseout.
[11:49:45] <wjfoz> How could I retrieve all of them? They have little diferents ids, like "select#med_1 option", "select#med_2 option", "select#med_n option"...
[11:49:56] <mgoeppner> tomasm-: yeah it will
[11:49:58] <tomasm-> wjfoz, you assign a shared class to all of them
[11:50:47] <burlyscudd> v333h17i
[11:50:48] <tomasm-> wjfoz, <input id="item_5" class="items"> ... <input id="item_13" class="items"> , etc
[11:51:51] <wjfoz> the class is nested_field
[11:52:03] <hlveheart> Hmm. well, thank you for the helps guys :)
[11:52:12] <mgoeppner> wjfoz: well there you go!
[11:52:19] <hlveheart> Back to recoding this piece of hell.
[11:52:19] <mgoeppner> hlveheart: good luck!
[11:52:25] <hlveheart> Thanks mgoeppner ;}
[11:52:50] <wjfoz> yes, they share the same css class
[11:53:04] <mgoeppner> then just use that class as your selector.
[11:54:26] <tomasm-> wjfoz, what are you using it for? do you need a list of values or just the list of inputs? $('.nested_field') is where you start
[11:55:26] <orentanay> It's time for your daily laugh, actually, this is my first attempt at a plugin, and I'm failing misserably. Can anyone see what dumb mistake I'm making? http://jsfiddle.net/3Aqhg/    thanks.
[11:56:01] <Eviltwin> orentanay: Don't use live, use delegate
[11:56:13] <wjfoz> I have to replace the content of all combobox...
[11:56:15] <orentanay> thanks
[11:56:26] <wjfoz> for example... for just one element I've been doing something like : if($("select#med_1 option").length > 0) { $("select#med_1 option").remove(); //function to append the content });
[11:56:35] <photosbyme> ah Eviltwin: still here thats good!
[11:56:43] <Eviltwin> $("[selector]").live("[event]",function(){...}) is the same as $(document).delegate("[selector]","[event]",function(){...})
[11:56:49] <Eviltwin> But delegate is better
[11:56:58] <Eviltwin> For reasons I don't have time to explain right now
[11:57:03] <wjfoz> it works... but I don't know how to do this with many combobox.... regex maybe?
[11:57:28] <Eviltwin> Wait, how are you trying to use this?
[11:57:31] <Eviltwin> Why are you trying to use live?
[11:57:44] <tomasm-> wjfoz, $('select.CLASSNAME option')
[11:58:06] <murosai> i have a very simple piece of code in my page: $(document).ready(function()    {
[11:58:08] <murosai> $('.country').append('<option value="va">Vatican City</option>'); });
[11:58:18] <orentanay> Eviltwin: I'm watching for the change in formfield content.
[11:58:31] <murosai> but still i can't see anything added to the select with class country
[11:58:51] <orentanay> My reading found that I should use .live instead of .bind
[11:59:02] <orentanay> but now I'm off to read about .deligate
[11:59:11] <wjfoz> but there are another comboboxes (that I don't like to change the values) that share the same class
[11:59:13] <mgoeppner> murosai: syntax errors I sense in you.
[11:59:26] <wjfoz> that's my problem
[11:59:37] <CrazyZurfer> Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeello!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[12:00:10] <orentanay> so in .delagate going to go away now and be replaced w/ .on for 1.7?
[12:00:15] <mgoeppner> CrazyZurfer: and I thought I was mildly crazy.
[12:00:21] <photosbyme> what is the best way to bind a slide to and element in Jquery  Ui
[12:00:22] <CrazyZurfer> lol
[12:00:30] <murosai> mgoeppner: firebug didn't tell anything about syntax errors
[12:01:01] <mgoeppner> oh you copied extra stuff.
[12:01:05] <CrazyZurfer> who can help me with something? :)
[12:01:15] <CrazyZurfer> about Jquery Mobile
[12:01:15] <mgoeppner> CrazyZurfer: that depends.
[12:02:11] <CrazyZurfer> @mgoeppner do you know about Jquery Mobile?
[12:03:05] <mgoeppner> CrazyZurfer: I have toyed with it, but haven't actually got grubby with it yet, so I may not be your best choice, but feel free to ask :P
[12:03:12] <murosai> wtf, i changed the .country to #country and now it works, even though the select has both class and id defined
[12:03:36] <CrazyZurfer> lol, I'll try
[12:03:38] <mgoeppner> is the class actually country?
[12:04:02] <murosai> yes
[12:04:15] <murosai> wait no
[12:04:17] <murosai> lol
[12:04:27] <mgoeppner> theres your problem :P
[12:04:30] <murosai> name was country
[12:04:42] <murosai> yup, silly mistake
[12:05:01] <mgoeppner> well if you wanted to use name $('select[name=country]') I think
[12:07:16] <Eviltwin> orentanay: .delegate is not going away any time soon but .delegate just calls .on with the arguments in the other order
[12:07:17] <sky> Eviltwin: id rather just not share the url
[12:07:24] <mgoeppner> you'd have to wrap country in quotes though. I forgot that.
[12:07:25] <Eviltwin> sky: Fine
[12:07:29] <Eviltwin> orentanay: And this .on is faster
[12:09:41] <CrazyZurfer> ok, I guess iIve got a Question (really a lot of them)
[12:10:47] <mgoeppner> start asking then!
[12:11:09] <CrazyZurfer> writing*
[12:11:47] <chrisvwebdev> hi there....need a quick opinion on coding convention..... we want to store selectors in a variable...is it good practice to go:   var $paragraphs = $('p');
[12:11:58] <CrazyZurfer> I'm working with jquery mobile. I saw the documentation (very poor), but i've followed some things of it. First, I started with the pageinit event. the code in there seems to work, but when I click on a link and try to execute code in that other page
[12:12:05] <CrazyZurfer> it doesn't work
[12:12:26] <chrisvwebdev> and if we adopt the $varname convention, is it overkill to say $($paragraphs).each();
[12:12:29] <CrazyZurfer> the code, even if I use pageinit of that "other" page
[12:12:46] <Brodingo> chrisvwebdev if your var is a jq object you can call methods directly
[12:12:56] <Brodingo> and yes its a good convention for performance too
[12:13:01] <kenthree> $paragraphs.each
[12:14:20] <murosai> hm, wonder why i can't see local variables with firebug? i only have watch, stack and breakpoint tabs?
[12:15:41] <mgoeppner> I really should mess with jQuery mobile some more...
[12:15:49] <mgoeppner> nifty use of dat-*
[12:15:53] <CrazyZurfer> xD
[12:15:53] <mgoeppner> data*
[12:15:58] <CrazyZurfer> ok
[12:15:58] <Jon47> murosai what do you mean by local variables?  local to .. your browser window, or any of the other million closures on your page..
[12:16:19] <CrazyZurfer> i'm new with it too... and as I've seen, it's really cool
[12:16:26] <andrew9183> mgoeppner / tomaws: how do i implement the blur function properly here: http://jsfiddle.net/Tgcr5/
[12:17:36] <murosai> well i mean local to the scope i am currently at
[12:18:01] <kborchers> CrazyZurfer: have you tried #jquerymobile? also, it helps to show code when you need help
[12:18:07] <Brodingo> murosai use console.log(var) to inspect vars in the console
[12:18:20] <Brodingo> alternatively console.dir(var)
[12:18:28] <murosai> i think at least chrome shows a list of local variables
[12:20:24] <CrazyZurfer> oh
[12:20:37] <CrazyZurfer> i going to that other channel then :)
[12:21:49] <mgoeppner> andrew9183: http://jsfiddle.net/Tgcr5/11/ my lazy fix.
[12:22:24] <andrew9183> mgoeppner: but it doesn't hide unless i hover over it and then hover out
[12:22:34] <mgoeppner> true.
[12:24:47] <mgoeppner> but I assume you are using it for a menu
[12:24:57] <mgoeppner> from the example data
[12:25:16] <CrazyZurfer> there are a lot of menu templates in internet
[12:25:30] <murosai> jQuery.getJSON( url [, data] [, success(data, textStatus, jqXHR)] ) <-- what does the notation with [ and ] mean?
[12:25:40] <innociv_> ebwise, you said you use netbeans.
[12:25:42] <innociv_> Erm, how?
[12:25:56] <mgoeppner> murosai: its optional
[12:26:07] <innociv_> I can't open a dir for web files as a project with netbeans.
[12:27:07] <murosai> but can you call the function with only url and success function?
[12:27:14] <murosai> like leave the data out
[12:27:25] <Eviltwin> murosai: Yes
[12:27:28] <Eviltwin> murosai: It does some type checking
[12:27:36] <murosai> damn, javascript is weird
[12:27:37] <Eviltwin> Your data can't be a function
[12:27:47] <Eviltwin> This is actually jQuery making it weird
[12:28:03] <murosai> alright
[12:28:05] <ChrisPitzer> anyone here have a favorite js templating library? I've just been using resig's templating library as it's super lightweight... but something with better syntax would be nice.
[12:28:29] <CrazyZurfer> no one in the other channels :S
[12:28:39] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: You don't want blur, you want mouseout or mouseleave or something like that
[12:29:20] <mgoeppner> I sent him it with hover out
[12:29:42] <mgoeppner> blur is dodgy on non input elements
[12:30:15] <CrazyZurfer> it's too hot in hereeee im going to die!!!! f****** summer!
[12:30:29] <mgoeppner> Someone lives in the southern hemisphere.
[12:30:33] <mgoeppner> Want to trade?
[12:30:45] <CrazyZurfer> lol
[12:30:47] <CrazyZurfer> ok
[12:31:01] <innociv_> When I create a new netbeans project, the only options are "Java, Maven, Netbeans Modules, Samples".
[12:31:16] <CrazyZurfer> might be some snow would be ok :P
[12:31:50] <mgoeppner> innociv_: why are you editing web files in netbeans?
[12:32:30] <innociv_> Because I hate Aptana, and apparently Netbeans does work as a Javascript IDE but I can't figure out how.
[12:32:46] <kenthree> netbeans works great
[12:32:48] <smplstk> innociv_: you need the version with the JS stuffs
[12:33:05] <kenthree> you need to download the PHP plugin for netbeans, then it'll work with js
[12:33:10] <innociv_> How can I add that to my Jave Netbeans IDE and be able to just swap between them like workshapes?
[12:33:47] <smplstk> http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/netbeans/7.1/rc1/ innociv_
[12:33:53] <smplstk> chooise the RIGHT one
[12:33:57] <smplstk> *choose*
[12:34:14] <chrisvwebdev> @Bordingo....thanks for the feedback.  yes, i prefer to call methods directly
[12:34:15] <smplstk> or just get the 250 MB that has "ALL"
[12:34:15] <innociv_> But I want to use both without separate installs.  I do Java programming too, for something else. :|
[12:34:26] <innociv_> I can't pick and chose? Bleh
[12:34:33] <smplstk> you don't need two clients man
[12:34:46] <smplstk> one client will be able to handle both types of projects...
[12:34:50] <yamahaalex37> can anyone please tell me why both these links are scrolling to about the same position:
[12:34:55] <yamahaalex37> http://jambotmedia.com/
[12:35:05] <chrisvwebdev> what will $($paragraphs) do?  will that wrap existing jquery selector objects inside another selector?
[12:35:22] <innociv_> It doesn't look that way if I don't chose the "ALL" one.
[12:35:23] <chrisvwebdev> so it would be a group of objects inside another jquery object?
[12:35:26] <yamahaalex37> and how i can modify the jquery to scroll the top of the page to the top of the href=#classname
[12:35:43] <smplstk> chrisvwebdev: yes
[12:37:49] <innociv_> Well I see PHP in plugins, but not javascript. I guess I'll see.
[12:39:37] <Brodingo> frames? lolwut
[12:40:57] <kenthree> innociv_: js is bundled with php
[12:41:05] <innociv_> Does netbeans not have something equivalent to workspaces?  I simply have this other tree in "projects" now.  But if I open files, they get mixed in with my other projects :|
[12:41:14] <innociv_> As in, the tabs of opened files.
[12:41:26] <smplstk> chrisvwebdev, I heard you like objects, so I put an object in your object so you could object: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/N3mZB/1/
[12:43:40] <hlveheart> ajpiano, not to bug you again with this rediculous problem I'm having
[12:43:42] <MikeD_> what value do i pass to .removeAttr() to remove the readonly attribute of an input?
[12:43:52] <webman> anyone know how to do that with jquery ? http://goo.gl/m9Txt
[12:44:07] <hlveheart> but how are things like PIE.htc able to create css attributes, but jQuery cannot? o.O
[12:44:16] <jbwiv_> guys, I'm trying to decipher some code I inherited. Can someone tell me what "this" refers to on line 14 of this pastie? It's not clear to me because of the callbacks: http://pastie.org/2940584
[12:44:33] <xcoderzach> webman: yes
[12:44:35] <Cork[home]> MikeD_: disabled or readonly
[12:44:37] <hlveheart> how does one inherit code. O.O
[12:44:40] <ajpiano> hlveheart: because i don't necessarily  know everything
[12:44:43] <ajpiano> look at their source :)
[12:44:57] <hlveheart> you do know everything, you're always in here helping people, and stuff.
[12:44:59] <hlveheart> ;}
[12:45:01] <webman> xcoderzach: i know how to do drag and drop. but i am a bit unsure about grids with different height and width
[12:45:07] <jbwiv_> hlveheart, other employees move on...and their code gets dumped on you ;-)
[12:45:14] <webman> xcoderzach: you got any idea how to do this?
[12:45:30] <sky> for some reason, adding a show() to my mouseenter event handler totally breaks it
[12:45:35] <hlveheart> jbwiv_, I was thining papa-code passed or something, and left it to son-code.
[12:45:47] <hlveheart> I'm bored, can you tell?
[12:45:49] <jbwiv_> lines 13 and 14 to be more precise
[12:46:07] <sanjayb> jbwiv_: that would be whatever is the current $(roles).reach( ) ..
[12:46:08] <jbwiv_> hlveheart, lol. can code produce offspring?
[12:46:09] <Brodingo> hlveheart csspie creates a bunch of VML bullshit that can really junk up the page
[12:46:23] <sanjayb> jbwiv_: and the this would be the DOM object, not the jquery object.
[12:46:47] <hlveheart> Brod, it's been the only way I've successfully been able to get jQuery UI Tabs to show up correctly in IE7/8.
[12:46:48] <hlveheart> ;S
[12:46:52] <jbwiv_> sanjayb, I see. thank you. where can I read more about this behavior?
[12:47:04] <xcoderzach> webman: use a different drop target for each grid element
[12:47:11] <Brodingo> hlveheart imo not worth it
[12:47:23] <sanjayb> jbwiv_: about 'this' in javascript? :) .. humm .. sure there's a bunch of good articles ..
[12:47:31] <yamahaalex37> does anyone know proper tutorial or documentation for jquery 1.7 page scrolling
[12:47:32] <webman> xcoderzach: but the grids have different size... how even create that automaticly?
[12:47:33] <hlveheart> Well, client wants tabs in his IE7. ;{
[12:47:58] <jbwiv_> sanjayb, no, about this in each()...because isn't each doing some majic to make this point to the current object in the iteration?
[12:48:42] <Brodingo> yamahaalex37 check out http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[12:49:12] <xcoderzach> webman: hmmmmm
[12:49:35] <sanjayb> jbwiv_: yes - this would point to the current object in the iteration, that is correct - ah, i see what u mean .. hmm .. probably best would be to just look at the jquery source and see what its doing there ..
[12:49:41] <webman> xcoderzach: you understand my problem? with 50 x 50 divs i had no problem. but how to create this?
[12:49:47] <xcoderzach> write a custom one using just the draggable and droppable
[12:50:03] <yamahaalex37> woah, Brodingo, thats whyat i wnat
[12:50:07] <yamahaalex37> thats what i want
[12:50:10] <jbwiv_> sanjayb, gotcha. thanks!
[12:50:23] <yamahaalex37> on the very first link, click "Ways to specify the target"
[12:50:28] <yamahaalex37> but where do they show you how
[12:50:51] <xcoderzach> webman: so your problem is that you have guns that span 4 grids right?
[12:51:00] <webman> xcoderzach: yes
[12:51:11] <webman> xcoderzach: or armor thats even use more
[12:51:39] <xcoderzach> webman: do you have anything already?
[12:52:05] <Brodingo> yamahaalex37 if you click on one of the demos it shows how to call it, or you can look in the js file
[12:52:24] <webman> xcoderzach: i already got a prototype with 1x1 grids. but i have no clue how to do 4x3 etc
[12:53:12] <xcoderzach> webman: on drop, disable the grids to the left and below, depending on the size of the thing dropped
[12:53:47] <webman> xcoderzach: you mind if i private chat you?
[12:53:53] <xcoderzach> webman: sure
[12:53:56] <yamahaalex37> is there code i can just include as in the head <Script />
[12:54:07] <yamahaalex37> that will allow all my href=#classname to animate scroll
[12:54:10] <yamahaalex37> instead of jumping
[12:56:14] <yamahaalex37> nvm this works http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/
[12:59:31] <murosai> how can i clear the contents of <select> element? just $(this).val()?
[13:00:19] <murosai> hm nope
[13:00:31] <sanjayb> murosai: $(this).empty() ?
[13:02:21] <ryanneufeld> murosai: see ?empty()
[13:02:22] <bot-t> murosai, .empty(): Remove all child nodes of the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/empty/
[13:02:57] * sanjayb needs to get better at pointing to bot-t :P
[13:03:11] <murosai> yes that works
[13:03:37] <croby> how would i perform a $.extend(true, a, b) but only merge properties on b that also exist on a?
[13:03:39] <appl3s> hello
[13:04:06] <appl3s> are any of you familiar with clueTip?
[13:04:36] <lohengreen> look on the reason of my kick on #gentoo
[13:04:54] <appl3s> in general, how does one have a form's action url load in a modal dialog rather than the parent window?
[13:05:51] <lohengreen> look on the reason of my kick on #gentoo
[13:08:18] <BrenoPerucchi> someone could help to loading a external url in javascript... I need to parse html content (online or offline) in this url
[13:08:40] <xcoderzach> BrenoPerucchi: $.load
[13:09:57] <BrenoPerucchi> already try $.get and page_request = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP") | page_request.open('GET', url, true)
[13:09:59] <desic88> puedo hacer una pregunta media tonta
[13:10:29] <BrenoPerucchi> xcoderzach: i'll try
[13:10:31] <desic88> hay alguna forma de ver mi historial de chat aqui?
[13:11:17] <BrenoPerucchi> xcoderzach: this is url to parse http://settings.messenger.live.com/Conversation/IMMe.aspx?invitee=6df87a68408c4bec@apps.messenger.live.com&mkt=en-br
[13:11:31] <chrisvwebdev> hey all..thanks for the objectionable comments about my group of objects in the jquery object :-D
[13:11:36] <desic88> la mandas de nuevo plz
[13:11:41] <chrisvwebdev> i object
[13:11:52] <xcoderzach> you're going to have to proxy it, because of cross domain restrictions
[13:13:38] <Brodingo> desic88 hablas inglese?
[13:13:52] <BrenoPerucchi> xcoderzach: hunn... thanks
[13:14:05] <desic88> si
[13:15:06] <Brodingo> well this is primarily an english channel... as far as logs i think there are some sites
[13:15:31] <bl4ckcomb> hi, I'm making a win 8 metro-ish UI that's loading it's tiles from a JSON API. now, what would be the best way for the general public to transform the JSON records to HTML tiles: $.tmpl() or a view function (passed by the developer with the constructor) that takes the object?
[13:19:14] <desic88> hi
[13:22:01] <yamahaalex37> wtfux is going on with my page scroll
[13:22:02] <yamahaalex37> http://jambotmedia.com/
[13:22:04] <yamahaalex37> click links
[13:25:50] <bl4ckcomb> yamahaalex37, what about it?
[13:25:56] <DRSK> Anyone able to tell me how one would do what I've tried here :: http://jsfiddle.net/yVZE8/ ? Basically I want to append &c={value_of_option_selected} to the href value of the link, but since it is selected at initiation I believe that's the value I get.
[13:29:24] <DRSK> Anyone ;o
[13:30:26] <bl4ckcomb> DRSK, trigger that code after selection an option (events)?
[13:30:47] <bl4ckcomb> s/selection/selecting/
[13:30:54] <mgoeppner> bind to onchange
[13:30:55] <DRSK> Is that .change?
[13:31:04] <bl4ckcomb> yep
[13:31:34] <anli__> I want a datepicker where I can mark days
[13:31:46] <anli__> Highlight them in some way
[13:31:54] <ShaunR> When having a link (a href) run javascript, if i dont want the link to do what it normally would do what should i do in the javascript.  I've returned false before but i've also seen examples of js that uses some $preventDefault or somthing function?
[13:32:02] <DRSK> bl4ckcomb  Thanks, that was easy enough :)
[13:32:40] <mgoeppner> DRSK: http://jsfiddle.net/yVZE8/2/
[13:33:00] <DRSK> Yeah :)
[13:33:03] <bl4ckcomb> ShaunR, usually I bind the js to a .click() event instead of specifying it in the href. then just do href="#" and return false in the function.
[13:33:31] <daleharvey> ok, interesting problem
[13:33:43] <bakers> What does cookie_encode do in the jquery cookie plugin? http://plugins.jquery.com/files/jquery.cookie.js__1.txt
[13:33:50] <bakers> looks like an unused function?
[13:34:03] <daleharvey> I need to do a drag selection over the page which will return all the elements within the bounds of the selection
[13:35:02] <daleharvey> anywhere I should start looking, that only way off the top of my head is to just loop over them all and check the coords, thats a little insane on mousemove though
[13:35:40] <mgoeppner> ShaunR: or you could bind onclick to a span and not worry about having to return anything
[13:35:47] <MariusKarthaus> I have an object that has .click() bound to it and is also draggable with a helper. If the drag is canceled by the user by dropping the helper back on the original, the .click() is called. I want to stop that event but I cannot find the correct event to stop. anyone?
[13:36:24] <bl4ckcomb> any opinion on my metro UI plugin ? $.tmpl() vs. custom view function for JSON data -> tile
[13:36:55] <sanjayb> daleharvey: you can look into document.elementFromPoint() .. not sure if there is a jquery equivalent / how cross-browser it is, but maybe good to look at.
[13:39:36] <mgoeppner> bl4ckcomb: I thought $.tmpl was going to be deprecated and rebuilt?
[13:40:48] <bl4ckcomb> mgoeppner, yes sort of
[13:40:55] <bl4ckcomb> it's marked beta and subject to change
[13:41:18] <mgoeppner> http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[13:41:28] <mgoeppner> red text
[13:41:29] <bl4ckcomb> but it's way cleaner than a view function imo. eg. for what I'll use it, this function would just wrap around a $.tmpl statement :p
[13:41:39] <mgoeppner> not that it matters :P
[13:41:48] <bl4ckcomb> the red test is what I said ^^
[13:42:17] <bl4ckcomb> I don't believe there is more information available about the potential changes?
[13:42:56] <bl4ckcomb> perhaps I could just assume $.tmpl() as it currently is, and then patch my code when it changes
[13:43:15] <mgoeppner> I guess it depends on how nitty gritty and how much work you want to do.
[13:43:30] <bl4ckcomb> well, it would involve 1 line change
[13:44:38] <mgoeppner> then I guess it comes down to maintainability.
[13:45:07] <bl4ckcomb> also, I'm offering the users to specify parameters in data-* attributes, which will work perfectly for templates (filling in the id), whilst a view function always has to be specified in javascript
[13:45:15] <yamahaalex37> bl4ckcomb, see how it jumps suddenly
[13:45:18] <yamahaalex37> jambotmedia.com
[13:45:51] <bl4ckcomb> yamahaalex37, jumping or shocking?
[13:47:50] <bl4ckcomb> yamahaalex37, are you playing WoW, watching a series, feeding your children and talking to a cam whore while you're asking for support?
[13:48:25] <mgoeppner> he probably is using a chat client that doesn't beep in IRC.
[13:49:14] <DRSK> How do I replace <a>text a</a> with <a>text b</a> ? Not just -1 but if a, replace with b ?
[13:49:17] <aleray> hi, i'd like to sort a list of dom elements by their attribute... I tried this http://dpaste.com/663501/ but the result is random
[13:49:21] <bl4ckcomb> nope, he's on mIRC
[13:49:42] <aleray> do you have any idea on how to make it work ?
[13:49:59] <bl4ckcomb> perhaps the cam voice's volume exceeds the beeps
[13:50:19] <bl4ckcomb> aleray, there was a plugin out there
[13:50:20] <yamahaalex37> bl4ckcomb, im building a website
[13:50:24] <yamahaalex37> but close
[13:50:32] <yamahaalex37> lol sorry
[13:50:33] <bl4ckcomb> yamahaalex37, that would have been my next guess
[13:50:39] <mgoeppner> DRSK: changing the text on the fly?
[13:50:48] <yamahaalex37> but it basically scrolls to a different place, then suddenly jumps to the correct place
[13:50:51] <mgoeppner> and changing it based on a pattern or?
[13:50:55] <yamahaalex37> and the second time, it doesnt scroll to the correct place at all
[13:51:07] <aleray> bl4ckcomb, I thought it was built in... I look for it
[13:51:17] <bl4ckcomb> aleray, http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jSort
[13:51:30] <DRSK> Basically, I have that select with options, on a specific option with value "tab" i want to change the text on a link saying 'blabla tab' instead of 'blabla space' but only on that select option value
[13:51:36] <DRSK> @ mgoeppner
[13:51:38] <bl4ckcomb> yamahaalex37, here (chrome) it works fine
[13:52:21] <mgoeppner> ahh
[13:52:30] <gho5t> if i want to use html 5 data attributes, i read them in jquery using .attr('data-my-attr') not .data() right?
[13:52:53] <bl4ckcomb> gho5t, right
[13:53:01] <gho5t> danke
[13:53:02] <mgoeppner> DRSK: give me a sec
[13:53:12] <bl4ckcomb> gho5t, .data() is a javascript attached object/value
[13:53:21] <bl4ckcomb> *jQuery-specific
[13:53:28] <ajpiano> gho5t: jquery will automatically parse those attributes into .data() cache
[13:53:31] <sanjayb> bl4ckcomb: but it works for data-attrs in the html as well, no ?
[13:53:34] <ajpiano> however it will attempt to do some casting
[13:53:43] <ajpiano> so numeric values might be corrupted
[13:53:50] <ajpiano> things with leading 0s, etc
[13:53:52] <gho5t> ajpiano: ok, so do you recommend to always use .attr() ?
[13:53:59] <ajpiano> i don't think so
[13:54:09] <bl4ckcomb> sanjayb, I don't trust it, but it could
[13:54:09] <gho5t> .data() is generally safe?
[13:54:12] <ajpiano> i tend to use data unless it's something i know is corruptible
[13:54:18] <gho5t> ok
[13:54:27] <mgoeppner> DRSK: $(element).text("blablaba " + $(other_element).val()); you mean like that?
[13:54:44] <DRSK> No, uhm. 2 sec I'll make a fiddle
[13:54:51] <mgoeppner> thanks
[13:55:08] <sanjayb> bl4ckcomb: yes, it does do some 'magic', as i understand
[13:55:15] <DRSK> mgoeppner  http://jsfiddle.net/yVZE8/3/
[13:55:26] <DRSK> mgoeppner  Selecting 'tab' breaks it, I just want to change it
[13:55:28] <gho5t> also, is this valid: data-transportation-id
[13:55:29] <daleharvey> sanjayb: didnt you help me yesterday? cheers :D
[13:55:35] <gho5t> or does it have to be data-transportationid
[13:56:16] <sanjayb> daleharvey: lol, did i? well, cheers.
[13:56:20] <mgoeppner> ok I get what you want to do now.
[13:56:26] <bl4ckcomb> gho5t, I usually do something like data-plugin/module-fieldInCamelCase, but I'm not sure whether there is a general specification for it
[13:56:46] <gho5t> ok
[13:56:59] <sanjayb> gho5t: am pretty certain data-transportation-id is valid.
[13:59:34] <DRSK> mgoeppner  Something like http://jsfiddle.net/yVZE8/4/ but it's bugging..
[13:59:41] <Eviltwin> What's the issue?
[14:00:02] <DRSK> I want it to replace CSV with TSV if 'tab' is selecting as option
[14:00:24] <DRSK> Else I don't want to replace anything, I want it to be CSV
[14:00:45] <mgoeppner> DRSK: I was going to add a data-type attribute, then cat that to a message
[14:00:58] <DRSK> Please do ;p I have no idea what I'm doing atm
[14:01:01] <mgoeppner> its quick and clean without a fuss.
[14:01:07] <Eviltwin> Jquery != jQuery
[14:01:17] <glide> is bluefish supposed to know javascript/jquery syntax?
[14:01:21] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/yVZE8/5/
[14:01:32] <DRSK> O.o it works
[14:01:33] <Eviltwin> glide: What is bluefish?
[14:01:42] <Eviltwin> DRSK: It wasn't working
[14:01:46] <glide> Eviltwin, editor
[14:01:59] <DRSK> Well, as stated jQuery != Jquery
[14:02:04] <Eviltwin> glide: http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/features.html
[14:02:05] <Flawless> I'm trying to create a jQuery UI Dialog with css units instead of pixels. It seems you can set the width in "em", but not the height. What on earth?
[14:02:23] <DRSK> mgoeppner  What would data-type and then cat do? Curious
[14:02:36] <photosbyme> I would like to know how to use UI slider to slide image content
[14:02:38] <Eviltwin> DRSK: This is why people use $ :P
[14:02:49] <mgoeppner> get rid of the need for your checks.
[14:03:11] <DRSK> mgoeppner  How?
[14:03:11] <photosbyme> most tutorials are showing for steps on how to use it for value
[14:03:15] <Mark-> I have a quick plugin auth question, when you set your defaults (options) and one of the objects you set is complete:function() {}, the question is why do you leave it blank?
[14:03:53] <Eviltwin> Mark-: This is so you can call options.complete() without first checking to see if it is a function
[14:04:03] <Eviltwin> But also making it do nothing
[14:04:38] <Mark-> So if it's empty on declaration what gets fired?
[14:04:46] <Mark-> (sorry for noob question)
[14:04:56] <Eviltwin> If you call option.complete() and option.complete hasn't been defined, you will get an error
[14:05:02] <Eviltwin> Something along the lines of undefined is not a function
[14:05:29] <Eviltwin> Alternatively, you can check if it is defined or check if it is a function before you try to run it
[14:05:31] <Mark-> right I get that
[14:05:50] <Eviltwin> But that means anytime your plugin would call it, you need to replace that with a check then call
[14:06:44] <Mark-> Yeah that's where the disconnect is (the check then call part)
[14:07:11] <Eviltwin> What do you mean?
[14:07:34] <Mark-> So in the settings if you had complete : function () {} // no code block
[14:07:45] <Mark-> then later on you call
[14:08:14] <Mark-> options.complete(varname, anotherName, {stuff: here}, options);
[14:08:46] <Eviltwin> One of the nice things about JavaScript functions
[14:08:52] <Mark-> Since it was declared with no code block or params I was curious why this example shows it that way (book I was reading)
[14:09:01] <Eviltwin> Is the number of params a function accepts and the number of params you send to it don't have to be the same
[14:09:18] <Eviltwin> If you send too few, the remaining ones simply get the value undefined
[14:09:25] <Eviltwin> If you send too many, they basically get ignored
[14:09:43] <Mark-> Right but why in the options.complete you leave en empty code block?
[14:09:59] <joojar> Do any cross browser plugins exist for handling text selection? i.e when a user highlights text in a text area?
[14:10:14] <Mark-> I know to define it
[14:10:23] <Pookz> Does anyone know why this won't work? It's really simple: http://jsfiddle.net/TqP28/
[14:10:24] <mgoeppner> DRSK: http://jsfiddle.net/yVZE8/11/
[14:10:28] <mgoeppner> would help if i could remember to spell.
[14:10:32] <Whirl3d> joojar, that's a tough one--I haven't found any good solutions
[14:11:00] <photosbyme> sorry to ask again , I just need to know how to use Jquery Ui slider function
[14:11:02] <Mark-> But calling it later since the original one was just complete : function() {} it seems it would fire it and do nothing
[14:11:51] <Cade> I'm trying to use jquery to put Lightbox in a page. This is my code http://pastebin.com/Fm5yyUM5
[14:11:57] <joojar> Whirl3d: I came across this but it's a bit old. Not even sure if it'll work. Docs don't exist either http://labs.0xab.cd/jquery/fieldselection/0.2.3-test/test.html
[14:12:00] <Cade> I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but lightbox isn't starting. I have it working fine on a different page without jquery, and Firebug is showing that the js files are loading.
[14:12:11] <Mark-> Sorry I'm coming from AS world, haven't touched JS is about 8 years :(
[14:12:54] <hlveheart> using nth-child, how would I only select the first 4 children?
[14:12:59] <hlveheart> nth-child(4) isn't working.
[14:13:04] <Whirl3d> joojar, that works better than any of the plugins I have tried. I was looking for the cursor position, though.
[14:13:31] <mgoeppner> DRSK: http://jsfiddle.net/yVZE8/13/ for it working at the start too...
[14:13:48] <joojar> I'll give this a go. Sadly I don't have a windows machine at hand to test on IE.
[14:14:00] <DRSK> Thank you mgoeppner, that's a better solution for me!
[14:14:05] <mgoeppner> it just gets rid of the need for ifs/elses/switches
[14:14:10] <Pookz> Does selecting and element like $('#'+id) work?
[14:14:36] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/6L7gm/
[14:14:48] <hlveheart> ^^?
[14:15:14] <Whirl3d> joojar, I'll test it for you. gimme a minute
[14:15:46] <erichynds> Pookz: yessir
[14:15:46] <joojar> Thanks Whirl3d
[14:16:10] <Rogi> is there a jquery upload plugin that handles file dropping into browser?
[14:16:17] <hlveheart> using nth-child, how would I only select the first 4 children? nth-child(4) isn't working.
[14:16:32] <Whirl3d> joojar, works fine in ie9
[14:16:47] <joojar> Top stuff. Many thanks Whirl3d
[14:16:48] <erichynds> hlveheart: 0n+4 maybe?
[14:16:57] <Whirl3d> np
[14:17:18] <erichynds> actually, nth-child probably can't do that.
[14:18:12] <hlveheart> yeah, that wasn't working either. ;|
[14:18:13] <erichynds> hlveheart: you can't .slice(0, 3) ?
[14:19:05] <hlveheart> Not working either.
[14:19:06] <hlveheart> :\
[14:19:18] <erichynds> sure it does!
[14:19:22] <erichynds> i show you
[14:19:29] <hlveheart> Not for me, maybe CSS just hates me and wants me to stop coding for today.
[14:19:31] <hlveheart> ;)
[14:19:32] <bakers> What's the .val() of a checkbox?
[14:20:20] <erichynds> hlveheart: oh, plain CSS? not a jquery selector?
[14:20:56] <gho5t> is it possible to select something via it's style? e.g. $('.foo[style="background:red;"]') ?
[14:20:58] <erichynds> bakers: whatever the value attribute reads
[14:21:11] <jayblanchard> usually 'checked' is the value of a checkbox bakers
[14:21:26] <jayblanchard> unless it has a value assigned to it
[14:21:45] <bakers> erichynds: So the val() is independent of the status of if it's checked or not
[14:22:37] <erichynds> correct
[14:23:12] <danzik171> gho5t: should be - ".foo[style*='background:red;']"     .....  that's a terrible idea though.  use a class to identify it or something.
[14:23:17] <bakers> should a checkbox have a value? According to MDN there isn't a value option?
[14:23:21] <bakers> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/checkbox
[14:23:38] <gho5t> danzik171: yeah. I'm actually looking to select a div#foo that is not hidden
[14:23:39] <bakers> oh wait that's XUL
[14:23:40] <erichynds> gho5t: $(".foo").filter(function(){ return $(this).css("background") === "red"; });
[14:23:41] <bakers> nevermind
[14:23:49] <gho5t> erichynds: ah. thanks
[14:24:10] <erichynds> gho5t: $(".foo:visible")
[14:24:14] <danzik171> gho5t: so just do $('#foo').filter(':visible')
[14:24:17] <danzik171> or that
[14:24:21] <gho5t> great
[14:24:54] <photosbyme> ok this is what i have done: http://jsfiddle.net/Bonkers/eLSrc/
[14:25:31] <jayblanchard> have a look at this bakes http://jsfiddle.net/hQ3L7/
[14:25:38] <jayblanchard> oops, sorry bakers
[14:26:13] <bakers> jayblanchard: That second one says "on" every click
[14:26:33] <aleray> bl4ckcomb, ok, this works http://dpaste.com/663514/
[14:26:39] <jayblanchard> bakers - yeah, it is just a demo
[14:26:43] <jayblanchard> not the best example
[14:27:00] <bakers> jayblanchard: but sometimes it's unchecked/off shouldn't the alert say that
[14:27:02] <mgoeppner> erichynds: just curious here -- why did you use the strict equality there?
[14:27:10] <bakers> jayblanchard: Oh I see.. nevermind
[14:27:19] <aleray> bl4ckcomb, this is what I was using but what i'm trying to do is to pass an arbitrary attribute and for some reason it doesn't work
[14:27:20] <jayblanchard> just wanted to show that the value is either taken from the value attribute and if there isn't on there is still a value
[14:27:26] <bakers> mgoeppner: always use strict equality if you can
[14:27:41] <erichynds> mgoeppner: because it's more expressive of what I want
[14:27:58] <Whirl3d> creating a plugin, why do some tutorials suggest using $.fn.fname=... and some suggest using $.fname=....? What's the difference and when do you use each one?
[14:28:20] <mgoeppner> ahha. Thanks
[14:30:35] <mgoeppner> I must have phased there for a second too... made more sense after a second read.
[14:30:39] <Eviltwin> Mark-: Are you still there?
[14:30:49] <hightekvagabond> are there any known gotcha's with the position option for jquery-ui's .dialog(), it seems to be popping up on my top left no matter what I do…
[14:30:55] <Mark-> Yep still ready the book lol
[14:31:23] <Mark-> I thought maybe it was declared so you could create a callback outside of the plugin
[14:32:14] <jayblanchard> Whirl3d using fn is recommended because this gives the plugin reference to jQuery's prototype object
[14:33:21] <jayblanchard> Whirl3d which in turn gives the object reference to every jQuery method assigned
[14:33:26] <supsup> Pookz: http://jsfiddle.net/TqP28/1/
[14:33:36] <supsup> also u need to look at left side see how i picked Jquery over there
[14:33:40] <supsup> it wont' work unless u do
[14:33:45] <Eviltwin> Mark-: Wait, what?
[14:34:29] <Mark-> let me fiddle up an example
[14:34:34] <Pookz> <supsup>Thanks, I figured it out
[14:34:39] <jayblanchard> Whirl3d does that make sense?
[14:34:45] <Eviltwin> Mark-: Did you see this? http://jsfiddle.net/6L7gm/1/
[14:34:55] <Mark-> Oh I missed that checking now
[14:35:05] <Mark-> OK I see it
[14:35:09] <Eviltwin> It shows 4 different ways of calling a options.done function
[14:35:14] <Eviltwin> In runTest
[14:35:24] <Whirl3d> jayblanchard, thanks for the reply. I thought that $.fn.fname= would make the 'fname' available to every jquery collection. Where $.fname=function () would only make it available to the items selected.
[14:35:35] <Eviltwin> And it's called with 4 different objects
[14:35:42] <supsup> cool was scrolled up thought u just asked that ~~
[14:35:49] <Whirl3d> but I see that's not how it is.
[14:36:16] <jayblanchard> Whirl3d yeah
[14:36:40] <Eviltwin> Mark-: So does that make sense?
[14:36:46] <Whirl3d> So, you only need to return $(this).each(....    if you want to maintain the chainability, right?
[14:36:55] <message144> Is there a .on() delegation event which can be fired when the selector is added to the DOM? So... `$('body').on('a.foo', 'added', someFunc());`  would execute `somFunc()` anytime a `a.foo` element is added to the DOM. Thanks
[14:37:05] <Eviltwin> Mark-: If you have the empty function, all four methods work just fine
[14:37:20] <Eviltwin> Mark-: If you don't have anything, the first one fails but the other three work
[14:37:34] <Eviltwin> If you pass in an explicit null or undefined (or something falsy), the first two fail but the other two work fine
[14:37:48] <Eviltwin> If you pass in something truthy that's not a function, only the last method works
[14:37:53] <Whirl3d> and to make a function private in scope, you would use var somefunc=function()   but to expose it (namespaced) you would use: $.fn.myplugin.somefunc=function () ....right?
[14:38:00] <jayblanchard> Whirl3d you actually do not need $(this) you can return this.each(...
[14:38:08] <Eviltwin> So it's a question of how protective you want to be in your plugin
[14:38:09] <Mark-> I get how that example works you posted
[14:38:10] <Eviltwin> How cautious
[14:38:34] <Eviltwin> I would probably argue that the 3 is the best option
[14:38:44] <Mark-> So you decided to not delcare it empty before hand I take it
[14:38:52] <Whirl3d> right, because we pass the jquery object itself to the closure. Ok, I'm starting to understand it a little better. I have read at least a dozen tutorials and they all do it differently.
[14:39:03] <Eviltwin> Because if they're passing in something truthy that's not a function, they have a serious problem in their code
[14:39:15] <Eviltwin> And simply not doing anything will probably make it harder for them to debug
[14:39:46] <Mark-> Much different from classical approach
[14:40:00] <Eviltwin> Alternatively, you could combine tests 3 and 4
[14:40:05] <jayblanchard> Yep Whirl3d, I can see the light bulb lighting up over your head :)
[14:40:22] <Eviltwin> And if third one is true but the fourth one is false, use console.warn or something to tell them
[14:40:55] <Whirl3d> What is the story with passing function names to the plugin as arguments? That's where I got completely lost...
[14:41:08] <Eviltwin> The other thing is if your plugin is minified (as JavaScript usually is in production), they may not be able to decipher the error
[14:41:17] <Eviltwin> And have to resort to unminified code to figure out what's going on
[14:41:21] <Eviltwin> Arguably still their problem
[14:41:42] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: What's the confusion?
[14:42:05] <jayblanchard> Why is that confusing Whirl3d?
[14:42:50] <joojar> Whirl3d: There seems to be issues with that text selection plugin with newer versions of jQuery. I have found this though http://help.dottoro.com/ljxjdqwh.php
[14:43:45] <Whirl3d> why would you pass the function name rather than just namespacing the function?
[14:43:54] <message144> Anyone know of a way to specify an event handler for when an element of a given selector is added to the DOM?
[14:45:18] <Eviltwin> message144: No, support is deprecated for listening for DOM manipulations and is not yet reimplemented
[14:46:00] <message144> Eviltwin, should I attempt to use livequery (using jq v1.7.1)
[14:46:01] <Eviltwin> Unless you're dealing with someone else's (poorly written) code that you can't change, there's a number of other better ways to do this
[14:46:26] <Eviltwin> livequery is probably one of the better options
[14:46:45] <Eviltwin> If I remember correctly
[14:47:04] <message144> Eviltwin, as of now, i am manually having to keep track of every single place in the application where a certain type of element is being added to the DOM. It is becoming pretty unmanageable.
[14:47:18] <hlveheart> anywho ladies and gents. have a goodnight..
[14:47:19] <hlveheart> :)
[14:47:35] <hlveheart> gunna go sit in traffic for an hour and a half after working 9 hours.
[14:47:42] * hlveheart wants to die.
[14:47:48] <Eviltwin> hlveheart: Leave later/earlier?
[14:48:05] <hlveheart> well, i'm sure my bawss would prefer i didn't.
[14:48:06] <hlveheart> lol
[14:48:11] <Eviltwin> message144: Can you be a little more specific?
[14:50:06] <message144> Eviltwin, I have a tagging system that converts <textarea> elements into tagging boxes, similiar to that of Facebook. New <textarea> elements can be added by many different scripts/functions in many different parts of the DOM at any given time.
[14:50:24] <albertosh> does someone know how to bind an onclose or onbeforeunload event to a window opened through javascript?????
[14:50:59] <Eviltwin> message144: I suggest you trigger a custom event on the textareas when they are created
[14:51:06] <Eviltwin> And bind to that event somewhere higher up in the DOM
[14:51:24] <Eviltwin> albertosh: Please limit yourself to one question mark per sentence
[14:51:38] <albertosh> sorry! Eviltwin
[14:52:01] <message144> Eviltwin, $('<textarea></textarea>').trigger('foo')  ?
[14:52:34] <Mark-> Hey Eviltwin I figured it out, was a blatant typo error :(
[14:53:20] <Eviltwin> message144: $("<textarea></textarea>").appendTo("[destination]").trigger("newtextarea");
[14:53:38] <message144> Eviltwin, oh right. Ok thank you
[14:53:49] <Eviltwin> Once it's added to the DOM
[14:53:51] <Eviltwin> Trigger the event
[14:54:14] <ravenzz> shouldn't he bind it before?
[14:54:19] <Eviltwin> Yes
[14:54:25] <Eviltwin> I mentioned that
[14:54:37] <Eviltwin> Well I mentioned he should bind
[14:54:55] <ravenzz> oh ok I joined the debate right now
[14:55:12] <message144> Yes, I was assuming it would be binded before
[14:55:43] <jayblanchard> Whirl3d I'm not sure what you're asking here - can you provide an example?
[14:57:14] <ravenzz> i'll go to sleep
[14:57:15] <ravenzz> bye
[15:00:42] <Whirl3d> I read somewhere that the preferred method for access a plugin's methods was to pass the method name as the first parameter for the plugin....something like $(".slideshow").slideShow();   then $(".slideshow").slideShow("next",{somedata});    where 'next' is the function name
[15:01:14] <Eviltwin> Yes
[15:01:21] <Eviltwin> You might consider looking at jQuery UI Widgets
[15:01:27] <Eviltwin> They make it really easy to do that stuff
[15:01:41] <Whirl3d> rather than $(".slideshow").slideShow.next(somedata)   ?
[15:01:56] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: because that doesn't actually work :)
[15:02:23] <Whirl3d> http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/10/a-plugin-development-pattern
[15:02:26] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: aside from accessing the plugin instance directly, there really isn't a working pattern that provides access to a plugin's methods via the jQuery object of the elemtn to which its attached
[15:03:55] <ajpiano> $.fn.foo.bar working is not the same as $("#foo").foo.bar() working
[15:04:04] <jayblanchard> Whirl3d what ajpiano said!
[15:04:25] <ajpiano> especially at all how you expect
[15:04:39] <ajpiano> which would be to magically get every instance in the collection and magically call all the methods in the appropriate scope, etc
[15:04:59] <Whirl3d> Perhaps I used a confusing selector. I meant $(sel).foo.bar()     that doesn't work?
[15:05:13] <ajpiano> i was not at all confused by the selector
[15:05:14] <ajpiano> no, it doesn't
[15:05:48] <ajpiano> some guy has a completely insane pattern
[15:05:49] <ajpiano> i think
[15:05:52] <ajpiano> that "works" for this
[15:06:04] <jayblanchard> Whirl3d $(sel).foo({bar: stuff}); is actually better from a namespacing POV too
[15:06:21] <ajpiano> http://milan.adamovsky.com/2010/11/jquery-plugin-pattern-21.html
[15:08:18] <Eviltwin> $(sel).foo().bar() could work but that just starts getting annoying
[15:09:17] <ajpiano> yeah it like, opens up a whole mess of problems
[15:09:46] <ajaxbud> Hey guys have a problem with a piece of code pasted here:-http://fixee.org/paste/rdr7o5h/
[15:09:51] <ajaxbud> can somebody take a look please?
[15:09:54] <Eviltwin> I suppose you could make your plugin support .end() to return the original object
[15:09:57] <ajaxbud> Thanks in advance
[15:10:19] <Eviltwin> ajaxbud: I aplogize in advance
[15:10:35] <ajaxbud> haha..Eviltwin funny
[15:10:42] <Eviltwin> ajaxbud: Also, see ? alert
[15:10:42] <bot-t> ajaxbud, Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[15:11:25] <kenthree> i used alert for the longest time *ohgodwhy*
[15:11:28] <ajaxbud> my problem is it doesnt even reach the point wherw I have used alert
[15:11:29] <bakers> What's the best way to test if an element is a checkbox/radio button
[15:11:32] <ajaxbud> :)
[15:11:45] <bakers> if $(selector).is(":checkbox")
[15:11:47] <bakers> ?
[15:11:54] <ajaxbud> There seems to be some problem in the ApaxkSubmit method
[15:12:06] <ajaxbud> Like it fails there for god forsaken reason
[15:12:12] <ajaxbud> *AjaxSubmit
[15:12:41] <Eviltwin> Might you have this problem? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5265914/form-ajaxsubmit-is-not-a-function
[15:12:48] <Eviltwin> bakers: Yes
[15:12:57] <Eviltwin> At least that's the one I've seen most
[15:13:07] <ajpiano> ajaxbud: you need to cancel the form submit default action
[15:13:34] <Eviltwin> ajaxbud: Isn't there a return false in there?
[15:13:43] <ajpiano> oh, right
[15:13:51] <ajpiano> good call Eviltwin
[15:14:05] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I suck at tab completing nicks
[15:14:16] <ajaxbud> but EvilTwin I am sure I have included JQuery.Form
[15:14:42] <ajpiano> ajaxbud: you can't really get good help unless you provide a demo that shows the problem failing somehow
[15:14:45] <ajaxbud> I am using Netbeans and I can pretty much see the code for the plugin in my editor when I ctrl+left click on the included script
[15:14:49] <ajpiano> "something happens" doesn't help us to know what is breaking
[15:14:58] <ajaxbud> Yeah..exactly..
[15:14:59] <bakers> Eviltwin: This is what I came up with? if ($(this).is(":checkbox") || $(this).is(":radio")) {
[15:15:08] <Eviltwin> ajaxbud: So what are you actually getting?
[15:15:08] <ajpiano> nor does it even prove to us that you're looking at the error console
[15:15:12] <ajpiano> and seeing what the output is
[15:15:16] <ajaxbud> But I have two files..How can I show it Piano?
[15:15:27] <Eviltwin> bakers: I *think* you might be able to do $(this).is(":checkbox, :radio")
[15:15:30] <ajaxbud> I am looking at the error console.. and getting the uncaught exception error
[15:15:48] <ajpiano> what is the exception
[15:15:58] <bakers> Eviltwin: that's what I was wondering...
[15:16:00] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, so would you explain why I constantly see $.fn.plugin.somefunc=function () {} and what does that do? Does it just allow you to override the somefunc function?
[15:16:11] <ajaxbud> jQuery is not defined
[15:16:12] <fructose> I have some code that is executed in a jQuery(function() { ... }) ... which normally I only expect on page load. Unfortunately, I have a modal popup that contains a form for upload files and whenever a file is upload, the stuff in jQuery(function() { ... }) is executed and I don't neither understand why that is happening nor want it to. Any ideas?
[15:16:13] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: it's not overriding it, it's declaring it
[15:16:17] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Where?
[15:16:18] <ajaxbud> (anonymous function)
[15:16:19] <ajpiano> ajaxbud: jQuery isn't properly included in your page
[15:16:42] <ajaxbud> oh but ajpiano: as I said I can see it included in my editor as well as my folder
[15:16:45] <ajpiano> what shows in your IDE when you click the file is absolutely irrelevant to us
[15:16:48] <ajaxbud> and even the browser recognizes it
[15:16:51] <Eviltwin> fructose: $(function(){...}) means "once the DOM is loaded"
[15:17:01] <ajaxbud> and the bowser thwos the erro at the lass line of JQuery.form
[15:17:04] <Eviltwin> So after the DOM is loaded, they fire right away
[15:17:32] <jayblanchard> ajaxbud are you including the files in the right order?
[15:17:34] <ajaxbud> ajpiano: ok, I admit that.. but what shows up in the browser might be relevant right?
[15:17:51] <fructose> Eviltwin: So does that mean it can be triggered simply by altering the DOM?
[15:18:01] <ajpiano> ajaxbud: do your showRequest and showResponse functions even fire?
[15:18:09] <ajaxbud> my order iss like this: jQiery.Form first
[15:18:14] <ajaxbud> then jQuery.min
[15:18:22] <jayblanchard> ajaxbud, there you go
[15:18:24] <ajaxbud> no ajpiano
[15:18:29] <ajaxbud> oh..
[15:18:34] <Eviltwin> fructose: Try $("body").append("<script>alert(\"Hi!\")</script>");
[15:18:37] <ajaxbud> let me try changing the order now
[15:18:40] <jayblanchard> ajaxbud put jquery.min first above all other javascript includes
[15:18:49] <ajaxbud> sure thing jay
[15:18:53] <ajaxbud> thanks..
[15:19:01] <Eviltwin> fructose: You'll see that code gets run
[15:19:02] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: the fact that you can't call functions that are stored as properties of other functions directly from the jQuery chain does not mean it is not *useful* to store functions there anyway
[15:19:18] <Eviltwin> This is what happens when HTML code that contains script tags is added to the DOM
[15:19:42] <ajaxbud> @jayblanchard no working
[15:19:58] <jayblanchard> ajaxbud are you getting a different error now?
[15:20:03] <bl4ckcomb> mgoeppner, I decided to stick with the view function, which can then just wrap a $.tmpl() if needed
[15:20:17] <ploo> if I do a $.get how do I put all the data into an array and seperate it by new line? in the data?
[15:20:45] <Eviltwin> ploo: data.split("\n")
[15:21:05] <ajaxbud> you are right jay
[15:21:05] <ploo> well its a <br>
[15:21:08] <ajaxbud> it is something like this
[15:21:11] <ajaxbud> $('input[@name=fileToUpload]')
[15:21:14] <Eviltwin> ploo: data.split("<br>")
[15:21:15] <kenthree> then split by br :P
[15:21:15] <WebDragon> if I have a div containing an h2, a paragraph or two, and a series of img tags unwrapped, can I find() the images and wrapall() them in a single container without disturbing the rest of the content in the div
[15:21:19] <ajpiano> ajaxbud: what version of jQuery are you using
[15:21:26] <WebDragon> heya ajpiano
[15:21:32] <ajaxbud> jQuery-1.3.2
[15:21:35] * WebDragon slides the carafe of DragonCoffee™ over to ajpiano 
[15:21:36] <Eviltwin> Oh Christ
[15:21:44] <ajpiano> ajaxbud: get rid of the @ in your selectors
[15:21:48] <Eviltwin> This is Drupal, isn't it?
[15:21:48] <jayblanchard> Eviltwin LOL
[15:22:01] <ploo> what about a assoc array? each line has 1,a <br> 2,b <br> 3,c <br> etc.
[15:22:04] <ajpiano> WebDragon: there's only one way to find out
[15:22:11] <ploo> :)
[15:22:11] <ajaxbud> oh you mean to say it should be something like this $('input[name=fileToUpload]')
[15:22:12] <WebDragon> TIAS? :)
[15:22:20] <Eviltwin> ploo: I'm not sure what you're asking
[15:22:28] <ajpiano> ploo: you should consider sending back JSON from your server instead of data that's formatted using <br/> etc
[15:22:32] <Eviltwin> ploo: But I can tell you it's JavaScript, not jQuery
[15:22:43] <ajpiano> ajaxbud: something like that
[15:22:52] <Hopsy> i am bored
[15:23:00] <bl4ckcomb> ploo, split the result of the first split by ',' ? or use regex... there are thousands of possibilities
[15:23:00] <ploo> I can format it anyway
[15:23:02] <Hopsy> someone else with a question
[15:23:10] <jayblanchard> ajaxbud $('input[name="fileToUpload"]') note the quotes
[15:23:22] <jayblanchard> ajaxbud and you should upgrade your jQuery
[15:23:34] <Eviltwin> Hopsy: You can help ploo
[15:23:52] <Hopsy> ploo: can you ask your question
[15:23:52] <ajaxbud> yeah sure..
[15:23:58] <Hopsy> I didnt saw any question
[15:23:59] <Hopsy> s
[15:24:06] <ajaxbud> Thanks jay will check it now
[15:24:12] <Eviltwin> ploo: Tell Hopsy what you want to do
[15:24:13] <ajaxbud> and even ajpiano
[15:25:32] <jayblanchard> the dog keeps walking into my office and then back out again
[15:25:32] <Hopsy> Eviltwin: do the evil dance, maybe he will talk then
[15:25:43] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, in the link you provided, item 5 on the list of goals is allow the syntax to be : $(selector).plugin.method()
[15:26:01] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: yeah, that link is i think batshit insane
[15:26:18] <ajpiano> i was just saying it existed, i pretty much think it's the opposite of a good idea
[15:26:26] <Eviltwin> Hopsy: Maybe he doesn't have a problem any more
[15:26:26] <jayblanchard> so I'll sign off and go let him out before he does stuff on the floor - 'nite all!
[15:26:37] <Whirl3d> I thought you were saying that I should use that as a good example. LOL
[15:26:42] <ajpiano> haha no opposite
[15:26:52] <ajpiano> i was just saying that if you're desperate for that pattern at all costs, there you go
[15:27:03] <ajaxbud> hey jayblanchard night
[15:27:07] <ajpiano> marry it and take it to a cabin in the woods where the rest of us don't have to think about it :p
[15:27:18] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I found it on Karl Swedbergs blog as well.
[15:27:32] <Whirl3d> So what is the best tutorial in your opinion...for creating a plugin
[15:27:34] <fructose> Eviltwin: Any way to duplicate that on jsfiddle.net? So far I haven't had luck
[15:28:02] <Eviltwin> fructose: Duplicate what?
[15:28:55] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: the mike alsup pattern is good, as is the http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring docs, as is http://jqueryboilerplate.com and https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-plugin-patterns
[15:28:57] <fructose> Eviltwin: You said Try $("body").append("<script>alert(\"Hi!\")</script>"); ... I don't see it being run
[15:29:36] <Eviltwin> Add guards
[15:29:37] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/kF3PS/
[15:31:07] <Whirl3d> Mike Alsup's pattern is what got me confused. He uses $.fn.highlight.format=function () {.....
[15:31:23] <Eviltwin> fructose: Or don't have an explicit closing script tag: http://jsfiddle.net/kF3PS/1/
[15:31:28] <Hopsy> i have been hacked omfggggggggggg :|
[15:31:30] <ploo> Hopsy, I'm doing a .get and want to pull the data into an associative array. so I have 1,a!2,b!3,c    ! is new line
[15:32:06] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: you're assuming that just because the sub-methods are stored as properties of the function on the jQuery prototpye, they're meant to be called in a chain
[15:32:12] <fructose> Eviltwin: Well, my original problem was understanding why jQuery(function() { alert('foo'); }); was being executed multiple times
[15:32:18] <ajpiano> in reality, it's just a convenient place to store those chunks of functionality
[15:32:27] <ajpiano> to keep your code from becoming monolithic
[15:32:31] <ploo> two splits on the data ?
[15:32:40] <fructose> Eviltwin: It doesn't seem like modifying the DOM is what's doing it
[15:33:15] <ajpiano> so inside of your plugin you can have like $.fn.foo = function() {  return this.each( function() {  $.fn.foo.getItReady( this ); $.fn.fooDoSomeOtherStuff( this );  }); }
[15:33:34] <Eviltwin> fructose: http://jsfiddle.net/kF3PS/2/
[15:33:38] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: and the whole "string calling style" is because someone puts in a piece of code that looks at the arguments passed to the function
[15:33:53] <ajpiano> and sees if it's a method
[15:35:01] <ajaxbud> here is a question out of curiosity, How could I upload an image on a website and display it right there once its uploaded?
[15:35:06] <fructose> Eviltwin: I'm really not sure what setting an interval has to do with it
[15:35:14] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: $.fn.foo = function( options ) { return this.each( function() { if (typeof options == "string" && $.isFunction($.fn.foo[options]) ) {  $.fn.foo[options].call( this );  }  } );    }
[15:35:24] <ajpiano> this is basically what the jquery ui widget factory does
[15:35:29] <Eviltwin> fructose: I'm still not sure what your issue is because you haven't really told me
[15:35:32] <Whirl3d> which, you are saying, is more efficient than calling the function property of the plugin directly
[15:35:50] <Eviltwin> Aside from the fact that there's a $() somewhere in this mess
[15:35:53] <ajpiano> no, not more efficient
[15:35:57] <ajpiano> actually working
[15:35:58] <Eviltwin> Make a jsFiddle example or something
[15:36:00] <ajpiano> instead of *not working*
[15:36:17] <ajaxbud> Is there an jQuery library that can help me with image upload and display dynamically?
[15:36:18] <ajpiano> which is what $("#something").foo.bar().addClass("something") will leave you with
[15:36:27] <ajpiano> unless you follow milan's crazy pattern
[15:36:35] <ajaxbud> or like an ajax call or something like that?
[15:36:49] <Eviltwin> To be clear, ajpiano is saying $("#something").foo.bar().addClass("something") will NOT WORK
[15:36:51] <appl3s> in general, how does one have a form's action url load in a modal dialog rather than the parent window?
[15:36:52] <ajpiano> ajaxbud: all you do is return the url of the image after it's uploaded and stick it in an img tag
[15:37:00] <fructose> Eviltwin: I have some code that is executed in a jQuery(function() { ... }) ... which normally I only expect on page load. Unfortunately, I have a modal popup that contains a form for upload files and whenever a file is upload, the stuff in jQuery(function() { ... }) is executed and I don't neither understand why that is happening nor want it to. Any ideas?
[15:37:01] <Eviltwin> I misread it at first glance myself
[15:37:31] <Whirl3d> lol. I guess I'll just accept that I am incapable of doing what I want to do and just use someone else's plugins. Thanks for all the information ajpiano, Eviltwin, jayblanchard, et al.
[15:37:34] <ajaxbud> ajpiano: thep roblem is I want the upload button to be gone once the image is uploaded, instead I want the image at that place
[15:37:41] <Eviltwin> fructose: Yes, my idea is that rather than telling me your interpretation of the problem, you show me the problem so I can make my own assertions
[15:37:44] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: that's not at all the case
[15:38:04] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: How about you explain your goals
[15:38:42] <fructose> Eviltwin: I'm not able to reproduce it on jsfiddle since it's doing a remote ajax call to obtain the modal popup info... not that I think it'd be a valuable use of time anyway
[15:38:46] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: the architectural issues associated with construting plugins in general does not mean you're incapable of accomplishing your task and creating a plugin
[15:38:46] <ajaxbud> ajpiano you there?
[15:39:00] <ajpiano> you just have to like, understand the constraints and best practises
[15:39:01] <ploo> how do I remove duplicates from an array?
[15:39:07] <Eviltwin> fructose: Does the remote AJAX contain a $(function(){...})?
[15:39:10] <ajpiano> ajaxbud: yes i am, but i'm not going to be able to walk you through doing this at all
[15:39:14] <fructose> Eviltwin: No
[15:39:25] <ajpiano> i am about to have a meeting and i fear that you are going to vamp me out
[15:39:46] <Eviltwin> fructose: Which $(...) is getting rerun?
[15:39:47] <ajaxbud> all right its cool ajpiano..
[15:39:52] <Eviltwin> And when specifically is it getting rerun
[15:39:57] <Eviltwin> ajaxbud: What's the issue?
[15:40:09] <hlveheart> Hey quick question guys. Why isn't this building my tabs at all when the ID exists on that page?
[15:40:09] <hlveheart> http://jsbin.com/idejot/2/edit
[15:40:15] <ajaxbud> hey Eviltwin I want an image to be displayed right after it is uploaded
[15:40:27] <ajaxbud> in the place of upload button
[15:40:41] <Eviltwin> ajaxbud: What are you using to upload?
[15:40:51] <Eviltwin> hlveheart: For some reason I can never see jsbins
[15:40:59] <hlveheart> I'll pastebin for yous?
[15:41:00] <fructose> Eviltwin: There's the main page (file.php) and an upload popup (essentially just a <form> with javascript) in fileUpload.php
[15:41:01] <Eviltwin> hlveheart: Sure
[15:41:02] <ajaxbud> I am using Javascript only
[15:41:19] <Eviltwin> fructose: What JavaScript?
[15:41:23] <hlveheart> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/TvsiRcH9
[15:41:26] <Eviltwin> ajaxbud: What code for it
[15:41:33] <fructose> Eviltwin: Progress bar stuff
[15:41:40] <ajpiano> hlveheart: because you can't check for something in the DOM *before* the document is ready
[15:41:46] <ajaxbud> all right I'll paste it
[15:41:47] <Eviltwin> hlveheart: What's your goal with this code?
[15:41:48] <ajpiano> in order to conditionally bind a document ready function
[15:41:57] <ajpiano> because it will never find it
[15:42:01] <ajpiano> cause the dom isn't ready
[15:42:05] <ajpiano> for you to find things
[15:42:08] <hlveheart> Trying to make my JS check to see if an element is existant on that page, and if so, build the tabs.
[15:42:21] <Eviltwin> You want to move the if inside the .ready
[15:42:40] <hlveheart> Is ther any other method other than just using ready? it's got a little delay.
[15:42:57] <ajaxbud> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/thefunkystud/N234u/
[15:43:08] <Eviltwin> hlveheart: http://pastebin.com/yuNwE9GU
[15:43:10] <ajpiano> hlveheart: stick that code in a script tag immediately after the tabs element in the dom
[15:43:35] <ajpiano> that's the absolute fastest you can get it to fire
[15:43:42] <ajpiano> and don't wait for document ready
[15:43:55] <ajpiano> just <div id='tabs'></div><script>$("#tabs").tabs()</script>
[15:44:04] <hlveheart> and that requires inlining code. hmpfh.
[15:44:10] <ajpiano> yep
[15:44:13] <WebDragon> ajpiano: the wrapall worked (no surprise there, after your comment ;) but I can't seem to be able to .wrapAll('<div/>').append('<div class="more-items"/>'); -- am I missing something?
[15:44:19] <hlveheart> gotcha. lemme try that. ;}
[15:44:20] <ajaxbud> or here Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/wBZF2UBJ
[15:44:21] <ajpiano> you can't do things with the dom unless the dom is ready, facts of life, javascript edition
[15:44:23] <hlveheart> Thank you guys :)
[15:44:29] <Eviltwin> ajaxbud: one of the options for ajaxSubmit is "success"
[15:44:34] <Eviltwin> It takes a function
[15:44:36] <ajaxbud> yes..
[15:44:44] <Eviltwin> And that function is run when the submission is completed
[15:44:47] <ajpiano> WebDragon: wrapAll likely does *not* return the new wrapper, which you're probably expecting it to do
[15:44:54] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry, you have that
[15:45:23] <WebDragon> aha. I'll need to both append that div, and then add a jquery cycle event to the wrapper -- would I use .live for that?
[15:45:28] <WebDragon> oh wait, live was deprecated
[15:45:30] <WebDragon> now what
[15:45:32] <ajpiano> whattttt
[15:45:45] <xcoderzach> live was deprecated?
[15:45:45] <ajpiano> WebDragon: .wrapAll("<something>").parent().doSomething() should do the trick
[15:45:52] <WebDragon> someone said that in here a day or so ago
[15:46:03] <WebDragon> I haven't actually checked up on it since I haven't needed to know yet
[15:46:04] <ajaxbud> EViltwin : here is the showresponse function code passed to success: http://pastebin.com/nGg194Bk
[15:46:04] <ajpiano> xcoderzach: .on is now preferred to live
[15:46:04] <Eviltwin> ajaxbud: You know about console.log, right?
[15:46:12] <ajaxbud> yes Eviltwin
[15:46:15] <WebDragon> ajaxbud: aha ok parent makes sense even
[15:46:19] <WebDragon> err ajpiano
[15:46:32] <ajaxbud> lol Dragonheart
[15:47:00] <xcoderzach> does .on do the same thing as live by default
[15:47:04] <WebDragon> ajpiano: once I've added the div to the live dom, though, can I be sure to (ROFL ajaxbud you missed too) be able to snag the wrapper for access via jquery cycle?
[15:47:19] <Eviltwin> ajaxbud: I'm not sure the success passes any arguments
[15:47:35] <ajpiano> success passes back the response from the script that you requested
[15:47:36] <Eviltwin> I don't see it in the docs
[15:47:42] <ajpiano> WebDragon: ostensibly
[15:47:58] <ajpiano> success: function(data) {} or some flavour thereof really isn't in the docs??
[15:47:59] <Eviltwin> Nevermind, I'm not realyl reading
[15:48:03] <ajpiano> lawl
[15:48:16] <WebDragon> hahahhah
[15:48:27] <Eviltwin> They just didn't show it in the success([data],[statusText],[xhr],[form]) that I'm used to
[15:48:27] <WebDragon> these aren't the docs you're looking for
[15:48:34] <WebDragon> you're free to go about your business
[15:48:36] <WebDragon> move along
[15:48:42] <WebDragon> xD
[15:49:01] <Eviltwin> ajaxbud: Why don't you try console.log(arguments)
[15:49:06] * WebDragon double-takes as joojar leaves the premesis
[15:49:12] <WebDragon> man that gave me a flip
[15:49:17] <WebDragon> thought for a sec it was jarjar
[15:49:28] <WebDragon> right as I was having a starwars moment
[15:51:42] <ajaxbud> lemme try that Eviltwin
[15:51:54] <Eviltwin> ajaxbud: inside the showResponse
[15:52:20] <ajaxbud> Actually the console log shows I ahve some problem in the imageUplaod
[15:52:27] <ajaxbud> 500 Internal server error
[15:52:31] <solidus-lake> hey guys, i'm having a really bad time with autoResize(); anyone used this before?
[15:52:37] <Eviltwin> There you go :P
[15:52:50] <solidus-lake> for some reason its autoresizing my form to maximum size on the first character input
[15:53:11] <ajaxbud> yeah Eviltwin..
[15:54:11] <ajaxbud> Eviltwin u there?
[15:54:13] <ajaxbud> document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = '<img src="/upload/'+data.img+'" />';
[15:54:17] <ajaxbud> is that syntax wrong?
[15:55:42] <ajaxbud> well it doesnt retun from my imageUpload.php
[15:55:52] <ajaxbud> looks like that atleast
[15:56:41] <xcoderzach> ajaxbud: it's not jquery
[15:56:50] <xcoderzach> ajaxbud: but it should work
[15:57:46] <ColKurtz> I'm developing a sort of flip-book that uses a lot of animation with the jquery spritely plugin ( http://spritely.net/ ). I have set up all the different 'pages' or 'panes' to have different graphic elements in them, but the client's made changes and now there are a few common background elements in all of them. Performance-wise, would it hurt at all if I had different DOM elements with the same background images animating in each frame? Or should I mo
[15:57:46] <ColKurtz> ve the same DOM elements between frames?
[15:59:39] <ajpiano> moving the same elements between frames sounds way more complicated thatn just having elements with the same bg image
[16:00:02] <ColKurtz> yeah i'd like to avoid it
[16:00:17] <ColKurtz> but idk if having 2 elements with the same bg increases memory usage
[16:00:42] <ColKurtz> this thing is getting really resource intensive and i've barely finished the first pane (of 3) of animations
[16:01:23] <ColKurtz> I'm almost wondering if I should have each pane as a separate discreet page, and handle passing data between them with a PHP session
[16:02:34] <ColKurtz> of course the biggest concern is IE8
[16:03:22] <WebDragon> yup parent() worked
[16:04:45] <ColKurtz> in any case is there a way to "move" a DOM element as opposed to clone()?
[16:04:47] <Ankhers> if I'm using a click event, what exactly does self mean?
[16:04:53] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: Sure
[16:05:01] <Eviltwin> Any time you .append .before .after etc.
[16:05:41] <bobdobbs> I'm trying to call fadeOut() within a parent fadeOut() callback. Firebug gives me "this.each is not a function". I updated from 1.5.1 to 1.7.1, and the problem persists. http://jsfiddle.net/SSByE/1/
[16:05:42] <Eviltwin> Ankhers: ?
[16:06:13] <Ankhers> Say I have two radio buttons or checkboxes, and I click on one of them, how can I tell which one I clicked?
[16:06:13] <bobdobbs> Calling another test function, an alert, from within the fadeOut callback works fine.
[16:06:26] <_thumper_> I am creating a cookie using $.cookie("cookieName", "0"). I am getting two cookies with the same name/url, but with different paths, what could that mean?
[16:06:38] <ajpiano> Ankhers: this or event.target inside of the event handler
[16:06:49] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: http://jsfiddle.net/SSByE/2/
[16:06:49] <bl4ckcomb> bobdobbs, tried $(this).each?
[16:07:01] <Eviltwin> Ankhers: this
[16:07:02] <Eviltwin> Not self
[16:07:55] <Ankhers> Am I unable to do this.val()?
[16:08:25] <Eviltwin> Ankhers: Have you tried preventDefault?
[16:08:41] <bobdobbs> bl4ckcomb: I don't quiet follow
[16:09:02] <d4rklit3> hiiiiii
[16:09:06] <ajpiano> Ankhers: $(this).val()
[16:09:12] <d4rklit3> so i have an interesting dillema
[16:09:36] <ajpiano> you definitely have to call the cops man, there's no way you can keep something like that to yourself
[16:09:39] <d4rklit3> i have a an input field which gets pre-filled and in that case i do .prop('disabled', true);
[16:09:45] <d4rklit3> when i do this the form doesn't submit whats in that field
[16:09:47] <^zoggy^> 1.8.17
[16:09:50] <Ankhers> ajpiano: Thank you SO much.
[16:09:57] <d4rklit3> is there a way to achieve this effect without doing something crazy
[16:10:07] <d4rklit3> and still be able to submit
[16:10:29] <ajpiano> d4rklit3: ahave a submit function that prop("disabled", false) to everything that's disabled?
[16:10:40] <Eviltwin> Ankhers: http://jsfiddle.net/3J3Nt/
[16:10:53] <d4rklit3> well this is in mvc3
[16:11:03] <d4rklit3> so the form itself is using some crazy Ajax.beginform stuff
[16:11:10] <bobdobbs> bl4ckcomb: can you explain what you mean?
[16:11:36] <ajpiano> why do people always have to ask simple questions and then be like OH I FORGOT TO TELL YOU, IT'S ON MARS
[16:11:53] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[16:12:27] <bl4ckcomb> bobdobbs, sorry, I thought you did this.each, but I assume firebug was pointing at the jquery core
[16:12:38] <d4rklit3> sorry
[16:12:45] <bobdobbs> all good.
[16:13:02] <d4rklit3> my current solution is to hide the filed and just add a new div w/ the value
[16:13:19] <d4rklit3> so the user can see their input
[16:13:20] <_thumper_> Is there a way to check if an element exists? if($('selector').exists()) ?
[16:13:36] <Eviltwin> _thumper_: if($("selector").length) or if($("selector").size())
[16:13:42] <Eviltwin> Or either of those > 0
[16:13:46] <d4rklit3> ok question then
[16:13:53] <d4rklit3> what is the selector for a parent
[16:13:57] <d4rklit3> of an element
[16:14:06] <d4rklit3> $("#el").parent() ?
[16:14:18] <Eviltwin> That will give you a dollection that represents the parent of the element
[16:14:19] <bobdobbs> bl4ckcomb: I just noticed something... the allback animation does actually complete before the bug gets reported.
[16:14:29] * Whirl3d is glad I didn't mention that my problem was on Mars...
[16:14:32] <d4rklit3> i just need its immediate parent
[16:14:33] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: Did you see my update?
[16:14:34] <bobdobbs> bl4ckcomb: So, the bug must come from elsewhere
[16:14:38] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: http://jsfiddle.net/SSByE/2/
[16:15:04] <_thumper_> So in javascript a number > 0 is true?
[16:15:14] <Eviltwin> _thumper_: A number that is not 0
[16:15:19] <Eviltwin> Just like C
[16:15:32] <bakers> _thumper_: Anything that is not: 0, "", or false is considered true
[16:15:32] <bobdobbs> bl4ckcomb: oh yeah - at first I thought it was just a formatting suggestion. But now I can see that there is a difference in the code
[16:15:44] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: Or null or undefined
[16:16:06] <_thumper_> Ah awesome, thanks
[16:16:13] <d4rklit3> Eviltwin, ?
[16:16:21] <Eviltwin> d4rklit3: ?
[16:16:29] <d4rklit3> can i do .parent().append()
[16:16:37] <appl3s> in general, how does one have a form's action url load in a modal dialog rather than the parent window?
[16:16:39] <Eviltwin> d4rklit3: To add something tothe parent?
[16:16:43] <d4rklit3> yeah
[16:16:49] <ajpiano> d4rklit3: more ?tias, less ask
[16:16:53] <ajpiano> ?tias
[16:16:53] <bot-t> Try It And See
[16:16:58] <ajpiano> ;)
[16:16:58] <d4rklit3> hah ok
[16:17:23] <Eviltwin> d4rklit3: Also, api.jquery.com is extremely thorough
[16:17:39] <Eviltwin> Read http://api.jquery.com/parent/ and http://api.jquery.com/append/
[16:18:07] <d4rklit3> thanks
[16:18:14] <d4rklit3> i just like the personal touch of #jquery :)
[16:18:27] <Eviltwin> We don't like the personal touch of you
[16:18:36] <Eviltwin> Not trying to be mean, just honest :P
[16:18:45] <d4rklit3> well i dont touch any of u
[16:18:47] <d4rklit3> personally
[16:18:53] <d4rklit3> its nothing personal
[16:19:43] <Eviltwin> We'd rather people come here if they actually have a problem they're already tride to work through
[16:19:52] <d4rklit3> anyways ya thanks, i came in here to see if there was a different more clever solution than what i did (which im sure there is) but this is fine
[16:21:19] <acidjazz> ive got this annoying issue where .html() isnt working in IE7, im doing a : drop.html($('.eventTpl').html()); .. i tested $('.eventTpl').html() and it returns html.. but when i check drop.html() after it i get null
[16:22:00] <Eviltwin> Well we have no idea what drop is
[16:23:10] <acidjazz> var drop = $(this).next('.manage_drop');
[16:23:21] <acidjazz> the code works 100% in chrome/ie8+/FF/etc
[16:23:36] <acidjazz> i think its an IE7 issue w/ .html .. although i tried .append() and still no luck
[16:23:56] <Eviltwin> acidjazz: Try logging drop.length
[16:24:05] <acidjazz> im wondering if theres a common issue/solution w/ IE7  .. ok Eviltwin
[16:24:06] <appl3s> can someone please help me with an issue? i asked on the jquery forum the other day but still haven't had a response: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/cluetip-as-modal-dialog
[16:24:31] <acidjazz> 0
[16:24:47] <acidjazz> before and after the .html() assignment .. so you think its the var drop line tahts the issue in IE7 ?
[16:25:01] <acidjazz> yea other browsers i get 1
[16:26:24] <Eviltwin> acidjazz: It's probably because in that context $(this) doesn't have a manage_drop following it
[16:27:03] <acidjazz> Eviltwin: how does that accomodate that all the other browsers it does?
[16:27:03] <Eviltwin> appl3s: Why are you trying to use a tooltip as a dialog?
[16:28:47] <Whirl3d> is there a builtin jquery method to determine if the argument passed is a dom element? and is there one for testing if the argument is a jquery object? something like: $.isFunction() , but $.isDomElement() ?
[16:29:29] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Why?
[16:30:01] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: foo instanceof Element
[16:31:26] <ajpiano> that doesn't work all the way back in ies though
[16:31:28] <ajpiano> it seems
[16:31:28] <axilla> anyone here can assist with jquery in Ruby on Rails?
[16:31:33] <Whirl3d> and to determine if foo is a jquery collection?
[16:31:51] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: You want to make DOM Element or jQuery Collection into a jQuery Collection, right?
[16:32:19] <RSchwab> can anyone who understands live() tell my why this isn't working? http://pastebin.com/55UFxk32
[16:32:20] <Eviltwin> $() can accept a jQuery collection, it just makes a copy
[16:32:31] <Eviltwin> RSchwab: Don't use live
[16:32:32] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: foo.jquery is a really easy yest
[16:32:33] <ajpiano> test*
[16:32:43] <Whirl3d> no, I want to be able to pass both a dom element and a jquery object (string, or function, or plain object) to a function. I already have the ones in () handled
[16:32:48] <Eviltwin> Use .on if you're in 1.7+ or .delegate if you're before
[16:32:55] <RSchwab> Eviltwin: This is in drupal so I'm stuck on 1.4.4
[16:33:00] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: And what's the different behavior for them?
[16:33:10] <Eviltwin> RSchwab: So .delegate
[16:33:15] <aro> is there a way to tell if jquery is loading properly?
[16:33:18] <RSchwab> Eviltwin: will give it a shot, thanks!!
[16:33:18] <Eviltwin> ?.delegate @ RSchwab
[16:33:19] <bot-t> RSchwab, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[16:33:59] <Eviltwin> aro: Meaning what?
[16:34:11] <_thumper_> var state = $.cookie("testCookie"); If I did that to an unset cookie, would state == null?
[16:34:29] <_thumper_> or state == "" ?
[16:34:55] <Eviltwin> _thumper_: Read the docs for the cookie plugin
[16:35:00] <ed1t> How can i get access to the this.id in the .done function http://hastebin.com/jEkyCpWNk4.rb ?
[16:35:03] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, obviously depends on the type of argument passed. It's a simple alignTo function where I can pass a jquery object, dom element, options object, array, or string--each would have a different implementation.
[16:35:07] <Eviltwin> Or see ?tias
[16:35:07] <bot-t> Try It And See
[16:35:10] <aro> well none of my $(function() { }); calls are running
[16:35:20] <Whirl3d> Thanks again for your help, Eviltwin and ajpiano...
[16:35:41] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: What are the different ways for each?
[16:35:51] <aro> but when i type $('body').remove();  in the console, it removes it successfully
[16:36:02] <aro> so i just wnat to know why the ready function isnt running
[16:36:16] <Eviltwin> console.log(typeof jQuery) right before or after the $()
[16:36:17] <tomasm-> how do I tell a JUI dialog to have a dynamic height, but if it gets beyond the height of the window, to add scrollbars? right now it just stretches too far
[16:36:45] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: for what it's worth, jQuery just does a duck test on obj.nodeType
[16:36:52] <ajpiano> and assumes that anything with a nodeType is a DOM element
[16:36:56] <Eviltwin> ed1t: You could do http://hastebin.com/TwYB3o5829.rb
[16:36:56] <aro> 'function'
[16:37:03] <Eviltwin> aro: Then jQuery is loaded and there
[16:37:11] <Eviltwin> Are you sure there's not a problem in your function?
[16:37:13] <Eviltwin> Or a syntax error?
[16:37:14] <aro> ok, that doesnt tell me why the ready function isnt running
[16:37:22] <Eviltwin> Do you have Firebug or something?
[16:37:34] <aro> yeah
[16:38:18] <ColKurtz> anybody familiar with jQuery spritely - http://spritely.net/ - know a good way to stop all animations?
[16:38:19] <Eviltwin> ed1t: Sorry, typo, this: http://hastebin.com/dAKkuUZdOZ.rb
[16:38:27] <Whirl3d> duck test....that's hilarious
[16:38:30] <Eviltwin> aro: See if it spits out any errors
[16:38:32] <Eviltwin> On load
[16:38:33] <aro> it doesnt
[16:38:33] <ColKurtz> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8317915/spritely-jquery-plugin-stop-all-spritely-animations
[16:39:02] <Eviltwin> You have Firebug there at load?
[16:39:15] <aro> firebug at load? i have firebug loaded right now
[16:39:20] <aro> im looking at the console
[16:40:00] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: Perhaps .fps(0) ?
[16:40:13] <ed1t> Eviltwin: that worked! thanks
[16:40:26] <Eviltwin> Or .spStop()
[16:40:31] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: Read this page: http://spritely.net/documentation/
[16:40:44] <ColKurtz> yeah I can call .spStop() on each individual element
[16:40:59] <ColKurtz> but i'm wondering if there's a way to stop ALL spritely objects
[16:41:05] <ColKurtz> there's no such method in the documentation
[16:42:22] <ColKurtz> ah it's okayi
[16:42:44] <appl3s> eviltwin: because I use it elsewhere on the site and wanted to just extend it rather than add yet another plugin
[16:43:09] <aro> $(window).load() DOES fire
[16:43:16] <aro> $(document).ready() does not
[16:43:32] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: It looks like $._spritely.instances tracks all of the animations/sprites
[16:43:38] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: Perhaps there's something you could do with that
[16:43:45] <ColKurtz> oh nice
[16:43:47] <ColKurtz> thanks :D
[16:44:11] <Eviltwin> It's not as simple as $._spritely.instances.spStop() (I don't think)
[16:44:18] <ColKurtz> var prev = num--;
[16:44:19] <ColKurtz> is that wrong?
[16:44:20] <Eviltwin> But with a little code you might be able to pull it off
[16:44:26] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: What is num?
[16:44:31] <ColKurtz> a variable
[16:44:33] <Eviltwin> A number?
[16:44:43] <Eviltwin> Like var num = 5;
[16:45:07] <ColKurtz> yeah
[16:45:12] <Eviltwin> Then that's fine
[16:45:12] <ColKurtz> well
[16:45:16] <Eviltwin> But it will be 5
[16:45:17] <ColKurtz> var num = parseInt($.param.fragment());
[16:45:21] <Eviltwin> Not 4
[16:45:24] <glide> anyone know why opera dragonfly reports selector syntax error display: none !important for 1.7?
[16:45:32] <Eviltwin> If you want it to be 4, you need to do --num
[16:45:33] <ColKurtz> which is 1
[16:45:53] <ColKurtz> so if num is 5 and i want prev to be 4
[16:45:56] <ColKurtz> prev = --num;
[16:46:04] <Eviltwin> Yes (it will also set num to 4)
[16:46:25] <Eviltwin> If num is 5, prev = num--; will make prev 5 and num 4
[16:46:37] <Eviltwin> Either way num becomes 4
[16:46:43] <Eviltwin> It's a question of whether prev gets the old or new value
[16:46:49] <ColKurtz> what's the correct way without affecting num
[16:46:50] <appl3s> do any of you know of a lightweight dialog plugin? i was hoping to use cluetip for this but I lack the know-how to do so
[16:47:13] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: prev = num-1
[16:47:18] <ColKurtz> ah okay
[16:47:18] <ColKurtz> thanks
[16:47:25] <appl3s> suggest*
[16:48:04] <aro> anyone know why window.load() would run but document.ready() doesnt?
[16:48:16] <Eviltwin> aro: We'd need to see your code to tell you
[16:48:23] <Eviltwin> And know which browers etc.
[16:51:08] <ColKurtz> if parseInt returns NaN, does that evaluate to false? as in I could use it in a ternary operator?
[16:51:35] <Eviltwin> ?eval !!parseInt("x")
[16:51:35] <bot-t> Eviltwin: false
[16:51:41] <Eviltwin> ?eval !!parseInt("1")
[16:51:41] <bot-t> Eviltwin: true
[16:53:03] <Dave_Stein> does anyone know how to make .tmpl() keep the line breaks when it spits back the template?
[16:53:16] <Eviltwin> ?
[16:53:36] <Dave_Stein> if i do $('#template').tmpl().html() all the line breaks are replaced with spaces
[16:53:50] <yamahaalex37> how can i change this to target the li within this class
[16:53:51] <yamahaalex37> $(".menuMain").fadeTo
[16:53:52] <Dave_Stein> it does that in an inferior templating engine i use too, but i figured out how to put them back in
[16:54:01] <yamahaalex37> would $(".menuMain.li").fadeTo work?
[16:54:01] <Dave_Stein> $('.menuMain').find('li')
[16:54:03] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: It's a CSS selector
[16:54:07] <Eviltwin> $(".menuMain li")
[16:54:09] <Dave_Stein> or .menuMain li
[16:54:14] <yamahaalex37> uhh i got 2 answers
[16:54:23] <Dave_Stein> jsperfs to see which is faster? :D
[16:54:42] <Eviltwin> I would be stunned if .find was faster
[16:55:33] <Dave_Stein> well isn't looking by tagname the slowest via css so it would be better to narrow it down first?
[16:56:05] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: it pretty much depends on whether or not the browser has QSA, i believe
[16:56:27] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: i don't know of any templating engines that preserve newlines in the original template string
[16:56:35] <bakers> Eviltwin: I think using find() will always be faster than a fancy css selector
[16:56:44] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: i wish it was an option although i know its way slower
[16:56:56] <Dave_Stein> bakers: I know using :filter is faster than .filter for browsers with QSA
[16:57:03] <Dave_Stein> had that debate and jsperf with imsky a while back
[16:57:41] <Eviltwin> It already exists: http://jsperf.com/find-vs-select
[16:57:41] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: the older engine I use replaces them all out with spaces so there's no syntax errors when evaluating. when i changed code to replace them with comments like /*REPLACET*/ i could reformat it back after the fact
[16:57:48] <Eviltwin> I think
[16:58:06] <Dave_Stein> im running in chrome now
[16:58:21] <Dave_Stein> it says that filter aws faster than all those css selectors
[16:58:31] <Dave_Stein> but that one is very diff than the two cases we were just talkin about
[16:58:52] <Eviltwin> http://jsperf.com/find-vs-select2
[16:58:52] <coldhead> hey i'm glad there is someone called Davey here
[16:58:59] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: it's a pretty horrible solution but i'm trying to get things from templates into codemirror
[16:59:00] <coldhead> do you ever get called Davey, Dave_Stein?
[16:59:09] <Dave_Stein> coldhead: only by one girl ever
[16:59:14] <coldhead> i love that girl
[16:59:33] <Dave_Stein> she's a single mom with two kids from two dads and she lives with her parents
[16:59:36] <catcher> I have some jquery that runs on a page, not attached to a specific element. After doing some other JS actions (ajax) and returning, I need it to run again.  .live() is working for the selectors, is there anything like that for the document?
[16:59:44] <coldhead> right on
[16:59:51] <Dave_Stein> i wish i was making that up cause she's pretty awesome aside from that baggage
[17:00:10] <coldhead> nobody is perfect
[17:00:13] <Dave_Stein> catcher: $.Callbacks
[17:00:15] <Eviltwin> coldhead: What?
[17:00:34] <coldhead> nobody is perfect except Eviltwin and paul_irish
[17:00:35] <Dave_Stein> or you can trigger on the body and do .on the body for your callback but im sure ajpiano has better things to say than me
[17:00:37] <Dave_Stein> haha
[17:00:49] <ajpiano> ajpiano's attention is being diverted now
[17:00:51] <Dave_Stein> i dont know who eviltwin is in reality, just paul irish
[17:00:53] <Dave_Stein> haha
[17:01:02] <ajpiano> cause someone just got over here to work
[17:01:05] <ajpiano> so i'll catch up w/ you
[17:01:11] <Eviltwin> I'm actually a Paul Irish clone
[17:01:24] <Dave_Stein> that's nifty
[17:02:00] <Eviltwin> Someone did $("#paulirish").clone().attr("id","Eviltwin")
[17:02:02] <Dave_Stein> find vs select 2, i wonder if there were 50 LIs
[17:02:11] <Dave_Stein> and only a few in each of the mainmenus
[17:02:21] <Dave_Stein> isnt there a fork option on perfs? come on
[17:02:47] <Eviltwin> Not if you do it, I don't think
[17:02:49] <Eviltwin> I mean
[17:02:56] <Eviltwin> I think you can't change my test case
[17:03:00] <Eviltwin> You can only clone it
[17:05:47] <techouse> how do i remove elements within a div?
[17:06:07] <techouse> $.('myDiv').childern().remove()?
[17:06:26] <techouse> i mean all elements
[17:07:33] <Eviltwin> $("#myDiv").empty()
[17:07:55] <bonhoffer> does jquery ui have a simple time picker in the jquery-ui
[17:09:47] <Eviltwin> Dave_Stein: http://jsperf.com/find-vs-select2/2
[17:10:06] <Dave_Stein> haha thanks checking it now
[17:10:07] <Dave_Stein> while going insane at work
[17:10:22] <Dave_Stein> ah that was glorious
[17:10:24] <Dave_Stein> 50k vs 20k
[17:10:39] <Dave_Stein> everyone always says the dangers of micro tests like jsperfs cause they arent like real markup
[17:10:45] <Dave_Stein> :D
[17:11:54] <Eviltwin> Then again, this is the difference between ~0.02ms and ~0.07ms
[17:11:58] <Eviltwin> Per run
[17:12:08] <Dave_Stein> yeah ha
[17:12:12] <Dave_Stein> it will almost never impact us
[17:12:17] <Dave_Stein> but fun geek thing to know
[17:12:36] <coldhead> have any impact on*
[17:12:47] <Dave_Stein> it would if someone were running that line on drag
[17:12:52] <Dave_Stein> but i dont know a use case for that heh
[17:13:25] <Dave_Stein> i mean it all adds up if something insane is going on
[17:14:27] <coldhead> ?optimisation
[17:14:27] <bot-t> The First Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet.
[17:15:55] <Eviltwin> ?optimization
[17:15:56] <bot-t> The First Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet.
[17:15:59] <Eviltwin> Huh
[17:16:04] <Eviltwin> Both spellings huh?
[17:16:29] <coldhead> i imagine snover was stung by my british spelling once, and duplicated it
[17:18:01] <Dave_Stein> back in the day .attr was so slow i had to switch it for [0].getAttribute
[17:18:08] <Dave_Stein> for certain operations where in a loop it added up crap time
[17:18:13] <ColKurtz> what's the best way to move DOM elements?
[17:18:14] <Dave_Stein> 1.5 to 1.6 fixed that, there was even a chart
[17:18:24] <Dave_Stein> $('#el').appendTo( $('#foo') )
[17:18:26] <ColKurtz> appendTo?
[17:18:29] <ColKurtz> ty
[17:21:13] <ColKurtz> aha! yes!
[17:21:43] <ColKurtz> turns out moving the same DOM element around works better than multiple elements with the same BG
[17:22:04] <sunscreen> wehey
[17:22:23] <sunscreen> nothing like freeing up 80GB when du -h was telling you 100% used
[17:22:50] * sunscreen burns the pron evidences
[17:23:40] <WebDragon> if I have a div that I added via wrapall, and I need to check whether the immediate parent wrapping that div is another div, or another p (which it shouldn't be and which if it is, I want to remove) how would I go about that?
[17:25:38] <Eviltwin> WebDragon: $("innerdiv").parent()[0].nodeType
[17:25:46] <Eviltwin> It's the all caps name of the tag
[17:26:18] <WebDragon> .nodeType? or .tagName
[17:26:29] <WebDragon> just found that in my searches.. why use nodeType, specifically
[17:26:43] <WebDragon> (I ask for informational purposes naturally)
[17:26:57] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I lied
[17:26:58] <WebDragon> is that a personal preference or are there specific reasons to prefer one over the other, Eviltwin ?
[17:26:58] <Eviltwin> tagName
[17:27:02] <WebDragon> oh ok :)
[17:27:29] <Eviltwin> I had to use nodeType more recently
[17:27:29] <Eviltwin> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.nodeType
[17:27:57] <WebDragon> ok so if $(this).parents()[0].tagName = 'p' how do I remove that wrapper without removing any of its children?
[17:28:13] <WebDragon> unwrap?
[17:28:48] <ploo> whats the easiest way to remove a duplicate number from a string? like 10 10 10 10 10 1 1 1 1 ?
[17:30:03] <Eviltwin> ploo: Strings don't really work that way....
[17:30:34] <ploo> yeah it would be hard I guess I can do an array and reread it and check to see if it exists or not
[17:30:49] <Eviltwin> WebDragon: Don't you mean == "P"
[17:31:02] <WebDragon> one supposes I do
[17:31:37] <Eviltwin> And it's $(this).parent()[0]
[17:31:40] <ohcibi> how to minify/compress js-code? is there no commandline tool? all i can find in google are online-scripts
[17:31:41] <Eviltwin> It's faster
[17:32:12] <Eviltwin> WebDragon: And I think $(this).unwrap() will work
[17:40:06] <coldhead> ploo: http://jsfiddle.net/6854f/
[17:40:59] <Eviltwin> coldhead: He may want to preserve order
[17:41:39] <coldhead> HE CAN MAYBE CRAM HIS FIST INTO EACH OF HIS ORIFICES IN TURN
[17:42:34] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/6854f/1/
[17:46:30] <coldhead> that's very nice Eviltwin
[17:47:15] <coldhead> meanwhile ploo has probably abandoned his project
[18:12:29] <Dave_Stein> my it's quiet in here
[18:14:02] <Eviltwin> Maybe it's...too quiet

[18:16:19] <Dave_Stein> ?js var Eviltwin = eval; Eviltwin( "alert('hello world')" );
[18:16:20] <bot-t> Dave_Stein: "hello world"
[18:16:40] <Mark-> Evil if you're near northern eastcost it's coming :)
[18:16:42] <felispeskus_> I want disclosure trianges
[18:16:44] <Mark-> coast*
[18:16:47] <felispeskus_> can someone point me at a thinger?
[18:16:52] <Eviltwin> Mark-: I'm midwest
[18:16:59] <Eviltwin> felispeskus_: What?
[18:17:10] <felispeskus_> disclosure triangles
[18:17:18] <Dave_Stein> is that like a love triangle?
[18:17:25] <Dave_Stein> I'm in the northern east coast, damn
[18:17:35] <Mark-> Yeah it's mostly northern midwest, tip of virginia up to michigan going east
[18:17:47] <Whirl3d> I want to pass a string of comma separated labels to a function that separates each label out, looks up a formula based on the label, applies the formula to the element and once all formulas have been processed, performs a callback...
[18:18:00] <Whirl3d> This is the perfect time to use deferreds, right?
[18:18:00] <felispeskus_> Eviltwin: |> more     V less
[18:18:10] <Eviltwin> http://radar.weather.gov/Conus/RadarImg/latest.gif
[18:18:25] <Dave_Stein> does "looks up" mean an AJAX call?
[18:18:40] <Whirl3d> no, stored locally in the plugin
[18:18:50] <Eviltwin> Unless you're doing something that takes a lot of time
[18:19:04] <Eviltwin> Don't do it asysnchronously
[18:19:04] <Dave_Stein> well if its all syncronous there's no need to use deferred cause its gonna process all 3 in a row and then do stuff, aka callback
[18:19:09] <Dave_Stein> unless i'm missing something
[18:19:30] <Dave_Stein> and by 3, i mean any number of them
[18:19:45] <felispeskus_>  ah!
[18:19:55] <felispeskus_> an accordion with just one pane!
[18:19:56] <Whirl3d> since these are validation rules, I don't want to fire the callback until each rule has returned either a success or fail. then callback
[18:20:16] <Eviltwin> Why a callback instead of a return value?
[18:20:27] <felispeskus_> hrm, no. that's not what it
[18:20:44] <Dave_Stein> validation rules from what plugin? wouldnt the flow be: submit -> validate -> callback for success/fail -> loop through failed/successful -> do what youwant
[18:21:06] <Dave_Stein> or is your thing pinging you on every single field as its validated?
[18:21:09] <Whirl3d> because, I am passing the callback success and fail functions along with the string
[18:21:10] <Dave_Stein> that would be lame
[18:21:26] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Why?
[18:21:30] <Whirl3d> worse, I want to do it for every keystroke.
[18:21:32] <Dave_Stein> yeah i don't understand
[18:21:45] <Eviltwin> Maybe make a jsFiddle example
[18:21:50] <Dave_Stein> was just gonna suggest that
[18:22:07] <kborchers> felispeskus_: i think i know what you're after ... just see ?slideToggle
[18:22:08] <bot-t> felispeskus_, .slideToggle([duration], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[18:22:41] <Whirl3d> If it was easy to make a fiddle, I'd be done with it. I'll outline the steps I plan in the fiddle and you can see where I am going wrong...thanks for your help. brb
[18:23:03] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: What we meant was show us what you're looking to do
[18:23:08] <felispeskus_> no
[18:23:19] <Eviltwin> Like inputs/outputs and methods you need to call to validate, say, one field
[18:23:29] <felispeskus_> mspaint time
[18:23:36] <Eviltwin> Not "write the entire plugin"
[18:25:11] <Dave_Stein> but i already wrote my own validation plugin
[18:25:41] <advorak> I'm not sure if this is a jquery-related question, but, is there a standard function to take an array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] and turn it into a multi-dimensional array in groups of three?  [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
[18:26:14] <Dave_Stein> you'd need to write your own function andi terate through and know to start another array after the index doesn't have a remainder on 3
[18:26:21] <Dave_Stein> well index + 1 since youd start at 0
[18:27:00] <advorak> *nods* I just figured I'd ask .. I noticed a prototypejs inGroupsOf() function .. http://www.prototypejs.org/api/enumerable/inGroupsOf :-P
[18:27:12] <advorak> I'll just roll my own, otherwise ..
[18:27:16] <Dave_Stein> ick prototype
[18:27:22] <Dave_Stein> the only function i took from there was pluck
[18:27:26] <Dave_Stein> and i just wrote my own in jq
[18:27:29] <Dave_Stein> based on it
[18:27:36] <Dave_Stein> you can prob do the same for that
[18:28:16] <advorak> *nods* I was just searching for a jquery ingroupsof function and came across those prototype docs :-P
[18:28:57] <felispeskus_> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/402/77724977.png/
[18:30:02] <Dave_Stein> wha tdoes it meannnn
[18:30:22] <Dave_Stein> it looks like you want  toggleSlide liek someone else mentioned
[18:30:49] <felispeskus_> tell me what's unclear and i'll explain further
[18:31:10] <kborchers> felispeskus_: that is a job for slideToggle
[18:31:17] <kborchers> it doesn't do everything for you
[18:31:28] <Dave_Stein> yeah youd have to use .slider
[18:31:31] <Dave_Stein> and have a pretty checkbox
[18:31:35] <Dave_Stein> and then make a combobox i think
[18:31:36] <kborchers> but it will do your show and hide
[18:31:46] <felispeskus_> combo box?
[18:32:08] <kborchers> pandora's box ... opened
[18:32:21] <felispeskus_> it is just the box with the arrows that i'm interested in
[18:32:29] <Dave_Stein> yeah thats a combo box
[18:32:34] <Dave_Stein> i wrote my own since its pretty simple
[18:33:04] <felispeskus_> how is it a combo box?
[18:33:06] <Dave_Stein> its just a div with an input and two divs as sprites for the up and down arrows, .on click
[18:33:21] <Dave_Stein> a combo box = input field with up and down arrows next to them to increment or decrement
[18:33:38] <felispeskus_> that doesn't even close tod escribe what i'm after?
[18:33:48] <Dave_Stein> that's what records at a time looks like
[18:34:09] <Dave_Stein> are you saying youre looking for a way to click the state checkbox nd then update the text of state: on?
[18:34:09] <felispeskus_> I ONLY WANT THE BUTTON THAT EXPANDS THE TOOLBAR
[18:34:13] <Dave_Stein> we told you!
[18:34:26] <Dave_Stein> ?toggleSlide @ felixpeskus_
[18:34:27] <bot-t> felixpeskus_, .slideToggle() - Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[18:34:47] <Dave_Stein> you can make it toggle a class on the element youre clicking to change the look of the arrow
[18:34:48] <Dave_Stein> to be up or down
[18:35:19] <kborchers> felispeskus_: so make a button
[18:35:31] <felispeskus_> so i need to update my button, and the state of the 2 differing sets of content
[18:35:45] <Dave_Stein> yeah, jquery gives you callbacks for a reason
[18:35:50] <kborchers> use the callback
[18:35:59] <kborchers> in slideToggle
[18:36:10] <ploo> inside a $.get how my variable becomes undefined outside of the $get condition?
[18:36:15] <ploo> how come
[18:36:41] <Dave_Stein> example code?
[18:36:46] <Dave_Stein> you probably are having scope issues
[18:37:32] <ploo>  var name=""; $.get { for { name+="stuff" } } alert(name)
[18:37:56] <ploo> not the exact code but you should get it :p
[18:38:13] <ploo> works inside the $.get but not outside
[18:38:53] <Dave_Stein> can you put real code on a jsfiddle instead of pseudo code
[18:39:18] <kborchers> ploo: most likely your alert is firing before your get returns its data see ?ajax101
[18:39:18] <bot-t> ploo, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[18:39:43] <felispeskus_> so, which callback do i tell to update the button?
[18:39:54] <felispeskus_> I'd be sliding 2 divs (one to visible, one to invisible) ...
[18:40:11] <felispeskus_> or would it be more sensible to just keep the row at the top?
[18:40:12] <ldexterldesign> hey guys. i need a plugin to randomise a bunch of list items - anyone know anything?
[18:40:50] <Dave_Stein> two divs, stacked, on click of top button, slidetoggle bottom div
[18:41:03] <felispeskus> "stacked"?
[18:41:17] <Dave_Stein> siblings in DOM
[18:41:19] <Dave_Stein> lbocks stack
[18:41:47] <felispeskus> so you think it'd be better to keep teh top block there then?
[18:41:52] <kborchers> felispeskus: in that case i would just bind a click handler on the button and in there you can call slideToggle on both divs simultaneously and do a toggleClass on your button or what ever to change the icon
[18:42:15] <felispeskus> kborchers: which class do I toggle for jquery things?
[18:42:29] <felispeskus> erm, for the UI icons?
[18:43:23] <Dave_Stein> *sigh*
[18:43:55] <ldexterldesign> http://yelotofu.com/labs/jquery/snippets/shuffle/jquery.shuffle.js looks like it'll do the job
[18:43:55] <felispeskus> problem?
[18:44:11] <kborchers> if you're usng jQuery UI, something like ui-icon-* where * is the icon name. you can see all of the icon classes here http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[18:44:48] <JesperA> How do i addClass to every div in the DOM no mather where in the three the div is?
[18:45:19] <Dave_Stein> where in the three?
[18:45:35] <cb-test> test
[18:45:40] <felispeskus> kborchers: so messing with the classes is the way to go? not something to do with icon: ?
[18:45:42] <kborchers> JesperA: $("div").addClass("wat");
[18:47:27] <kborchers> you could do something like $("yourButton").button("option", "icons", {primary: "ui-icon-gear"}); if you want felispeskus
[18:47:56] <felispeskus> hmm
[18:47:58] <JesperA> kborchers doesnt work :S
[18:47:58] <kborchers> that's probably the right way
[18:48:27] <kborchers> JesperA: then something else is wrong see ?demo
[18:48:28] <bot-t> JesperA, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[18:49:15] <JesperA> 1 sec
[18:52:20] <JesperA> hmm, weird, it works with $ but not in compatability mode: jQuery
[18:53:24] <JesperA> oh, got it to work: http://jsfiddle.net/etkSe/1/
[18:53:29] <JesperA> dont know why it didnt before
[18:54:00] <ploo> http://jsfiddle.net/sBFd5/
[18:54:17] <xsamurai> I need to reference a particular function in 3 separate js files, is getscript the proper function for this
[18:55:50] <kborchers> ploo: i already told you your problem see ?ajax101  you are returning newArr before the get receives its data
[18:55:51] <bot-t> ploo, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[18:56:16] <ploo> sorry I missed that
[18:56:24] <ploo> example code around it
[18:56:32] <Dave_Stein> yes build is done
[18:56:34] <Dave_Stein> im outta here
[18:57:09] <ramkamx> hello
[18:58:12] <ekkis> xsamurai: just include all 3 files and the function will be available
[18:58:35] <ramkamx> i'm getting some trouble handing over variables in a function() { } .... http://jsfiddle.net/mF5SJ/
[18:59:15] <ramkamx> only the last variable in the loop is handed over  http://jsfiddle.net/mF5SJ/
[18:59:23] <Whirl3d> Okay, Eviltwin, Here is the basic idea. I know my implementation is all wrong and I haven't defined any of the plugins methods or made it a closure
[18:59:34] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/kYDbX/2/
[18:59:58] <Whirl3d> This is my first attempt at a plugin and I'm sure it's a wreck, so please be gentle.
[18:59:59] <ramkamx> There is a jquery function that fixes that, but i forgot its name ... anyone ?
[19:01:06] <ekkis> ramkamx: how do you know only the last variable is being handed over?
[19:01:16] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: This synchronously calls the callbacks
[19:01:31] <Eviltwin> And it calls either one callback or the other depending on whether it was valid or not
[19:01:31] <ekkis> you run through a loop, calling db.transaction() and you pass it each time a function... so what happens next?
[19:01:48] <Eviltwin> This really shouldn't be done with callbacks
[19:02:13] <Whirl3d> Why is that?
[19:02:18] <ramkamx> ekkis: the logs show me that. i've updated to full code : http://jsfiddle.net/M8hKm/
[19:02:33] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Because it's easy to make synchronous things asynchronous and very difficult to do the opposite
[19:02:43] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: I see your problem
[19:02:48] <Eviltwin> Are you using jQuery or not?
[19:02:57] <ramkamx> Eviltwin: yes
[19:02:57] <ploo> whats the correct way to get data from a get request?
[19:03:35] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: One solution is to replace the for(k in sqlCreateQueries) with $.each(sqlCreateQueries,function(k,qry) { ... })
[19:03:46] <Eviltwin> Which makes sense if you're using jQuery
[19:03:50] <techouse> can anyone explain to me why i get XMLHttpRequest cannot load an URL with jQuery when making an ajax call on my server but when i try it on my localhost it works :/
[19:04:19] <ramkamx> Eviltwin, ok, will try. What's the difference, i'd be happy to understand the scope of the variables, i always get confused
[19:05:06] <ekkis> ramkamx: for (var k ... I think
[19:05:15] <ekkis> because that makes the variable locally scoped
[19:05:47] <ekkis> otherwise it's a global variable and it will get set many times before the first function gets called... ergo getting only the last value
[19:05:50] <ploo> kborchers, how do I know the request is complete with sucess?
[19:05:54] <ekkis> I think that's the problem
[19:06:37] <ramkamx> ekkis: var = no effect, same problem, trying $.each()
[19:06:56] <capcipcup> .exit
[19:07:17] <felispeskus> what's a good place to keep the state of your UI? if i want to have a button that toggles states, would I use a css class to say "editable" "uneditable"?
[19:07:43] <felispeskus> i have to know that it's editiable to make it uneditable, right?
[19:07:56] <ekkis> felispeskus: .data ?
[19:07:57] <kborchers> ploo: with .get, that callback you are supplying to assign your returned data to the array is a success callback. if you move your return inside that callback, it should work ... as long as what you are returning the data to is ok with it being asynchronous
[19:08:30] <felispeskus> ekkis: I see
[19:08:42] <ploo> ok, yeah all I want is the all the data back when that request completes
[19:09:39] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: http://jsfiddle.net/4K56h/
[19:09:53] <Eviltwin> Only functions create new scopes
[19:09:59] <Eviltwin> Which is why .each works
[19:09:59] <felispeskus> ekkis: why isn't it $('.cat').data( 'key' ) ? why do i pass an element into it?
[19:10:44] <ramkamx> Eviltwin: it works but with $.each(sqlCreateQueries, function(k) {  //without the " ,qry)"
[19:10:51] <ekkis> Eviltwin: so the for() doesn't create a new scope?? if you do: for (var i in o), i is locally scoped to the for loop, no?
[19:11:12] <ploo> kborchers, inside that callback with return it shows up as undefined and I change it to alert it works fine
[19:11:13] <Eviltwin> ekkis: It's actually identical to var i; for(i in o)
[19:11:24] <Eviltwin> The *ONLY* thing that creates a new scope is a function
[19:11:27] <ploo> other function just calls that and alert's
[19:11:29] <ekkis> felispeskus: when you say "element" does that refer to "key"?
[19:11:55] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: The qry was there so you didn't have to do sqlCreateQueries[k]
[19:12:08] <kborchers> ploo: again, your alert will fire before the data is returned because it will also not wait on the get
[19:12:28] <ekkis> Eviltwin: so it should work in his case then, because it still locally scoped to the function createTables()
[19:12:54] <ploo> from the other function right?
[19:12:59] <ploo> hmm gotcha I guess
[19:12:59] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: You can artificially create a new scope using a closure: http://jsfiddle.net/YvC4a/
[19:13:11] <Eviltwin> ekkis: Right but there's still only one variable for that thing
[19:13:12] <ekkis> felispeskus: 'key' is some name by which you'll store the value.  it's an index
[19:13:22] <Eviltwin> And you see further in he's trying to use the key for that specific loop
[19:13:38] <ekkis> Eviltwin: oh... duh.  right
[19:14:12] <felispeskus> ekkis: the jquery docs say element is the first argument
[19:14:40] <felispeskus> ekkis: or is element implicit?
[19:15:22] <ekkis> felispeskus: suppose your button is called "go", then you could do: $('#go').data('mystate') = "ON"
[19:15:23] <Eviltwin> felispeskus: There's a difference between .data and $.data
[19:15:25] <Eviltwin> ?.data
[19:15:25] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[19:15:27] <ekkis> does that explain it?
[19:15:31] <Eviltwin> ?$.data
[19:15:32] <bot-t> Eviltwin, .data() - Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[19:15:54] <Eviltwin> That second one should have been http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[19:16:48] <ekkis> felispeskus: http://api.jquery.com/data/
[19:19:19] <felispeskus> ekkis: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/ ?
[19:19:45] <ekkis> I just prefer the other syntax
[19:19:55] <ekkis> it's more readable to me
[19:20:15] <Eviltwin> Definitely
[19:20:23] <ramkamx> Eviltwin: i'm a bit confused, any good article on closures ? (my background is civil engineering, but i like playing with code :-) ?
[19:20:24] <felispeskus> i see.
[19:20:30] <felispeskus> so they're the same method but called differently?
[19:20:37] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: Yeah, let me find it
[19:21:15] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: This might work for you: http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#function.closures
[19:21:46] <cb-test> test ben_alman 123
[19:22:03] <ekkis> felispeskus: yes, I guess
[19:30:01] <ramkamx> Eviltwin: thx. i'm learning ... anonymous wrapper ... :) cheers
[19:31:42] <ekkis> Eviltwin: I was struggling for a couple of days with an issue.  I gave up on it but maybe you have some ideas? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8283360/where-are-scripts-loaded-after-an-ajax-call-redux
[19:32:03] <ekkis> seems like what I wanted was so simple but I just couldn't make it work
[19:33:12] <ramkamx> Eviltwin; if i get it right, the wrapper makes a copy of the variables, the function uses variables, and when the function is finished the garbarde collector just dumps the copy ?
[19:33:41] <ChiPoLy> wow, this is a lot of ppl here
[19:34:08] <ColKurtz> woohoo
[19:34:19] <ChiPoLy> greetings from krypton
[19:34:28] <ChiPoLy> whats left of it
[19:34:32] <ColKurtz> i've got the basic skeleton working with slides / questions / anwsers and a result - http://comps.gunnjerkens.com/brookfield-sd/quiz.html
[19:35:55] <ChiPoLy> can anyone help me out with a jQuery issue? :D
[19:37:50] <ivmx> don't know :S
[19:38:47] <ivmx> like what?
[19:39:58] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: Each time a function is run, a copy of the arguments and anything with "var" in front of it are made for the function
[19:40:06] <Eviltwin> And they get garbage collected later
[19:40:19] <Eviltwin> Any function has access to its own variables
[19:40:31] <Eviltwin> And any of the ones from the scopes its inside
[19:41:38] <ChiPoLy> Eviltwin I can tell u know what ur talking about (Y)
[19:41:45] <ramkamx> Eviltwin: but the scope dissapears while waiting for the callback hence my problem and the need for closures / wrappers ?
[19:42:11] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: You mean your original problem?
[19:42:16] <ramkamx> yep
[19:42:24] <ramkamx> thx btw it's solved
[19:42:35] <Eviltwin> Do you have the link to your original?
[19:42:46] * ChiPoLy has a question 
[19:43:07] <ramkamx>  http://jsfiddle.net/mF5SJ/   and full code :   http://jsfiddle.net/M8hKm/
[19:43:09] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ ChiPoLy
[19:43:09] <bot-t> ChiPoLy, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[19:43:39] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: Lets take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/HYjB3/
[19:43:53] <Eviltwin> When you run createTables
[19:44:07] <ramkamx> following
[19:44:08] <Eviltwin> The var k causes it to make one variable k in that function
[19:44:17] <Eviltwin> Only one copy of k
[19:44:23] <Eviltwin> Now it loops
[19:44:38] <Eviltwin> Calls db.transaction for each of the queries
[19:44:48] <Eviltwin> Those take some time
[19:45:04] <Eviltwin> So all the calls to db.transaction happen before the callback functions are called
[19:45:25] <Eviltwin> Now they each get a different transaction
[19:45:46] <Eviltwin> But the one k is left pointing at the last key in the object
[19:46:00] <Eviltwin> Does that make sense?
[19:46:19] <ramkamx> yes, so replacing function() { customHandler_LogMessage( successMessage )
[19:46:36] <ramkamx> by (function() { customHandler_LogMessage( msg ) )(successMessage)
[19:46:38] <ramkamx> would work
[19:47:22] <Eviltwin> Look at http://jsfiddle.net/q5n39/
[19:47:30] <Eviltwin> Now with each loop
[19:47:41] <Eviltwin> That anonymous function is run
[19:47:50] <Eviltwin> Err http://jsfiddle.net/q5n39/1/
[19:48:00] <Eviltwin> With each loop that anonymous function is run
[19:48:15] <Eviltwin> And a "j" is created for each one
[19:48:21] <Eviltwin> And initialized to what "k" is at that moment
[19:48:38] <Eviltwin> Does that make sense?
[19:49:40] <Eviltwin> This requires understanding asynchronous programming as well
[19:50:59] <ramkamx> Eviltwin: yes. for my understanding, that should in theory work too because the call to db.transaction is done on the spot ? http://jsfiddle.net/GCXVW/
[19:51:28] <Eviltwin> Do you understand the distinction between defining or referring to a function and executing a function?
[19:51:56] <ramkamx> Eviltwin: yes
[19:52:45] <Eviltwin> I've put 4 markers in here: http://jsfiddle.net/Jh2HT/
[19:52:51] <Eviltwin> Can you tell me what order they will be run in?
[19:53:53] <Eviltwin> Let's pretend there are two queries
[19:53:58] <Eviltwin> One named bar and one named foo
[19:54:06] <ramkamx> X1, X2, X3, X4, and somewhere in between nullHandler()
[19:54:22] <Eviltwin> Give me X#(name) in order for the full run of the function
[19:54:30] <Eviltwin> Assuming bar happens before foo
[19:54:39] <ramkamx> unless if db.transaction is asynchronous
[19:54:48] <Eviltwin> It is (or at least I'm assuming)
[19:54:58] <ramkamx> in which case : X1, X4, X2, X3, nullHandler
[19:55:06] <Eviltwin> Correct
[19:55:17] <Eviltwin> And for what I described
[19:55:24] <Eviltwin> If bar responds before foo
[19:55:47] <ramkamx> So it's asynchronous to handle because it's an API to a sqlite object
[19:55:50] <Eviltwin> X1(bar) X4(bar) X1(foo) X4(foo) X2(bar) X3(bar) X2(foo) X3(foo)
[19:56:31] <ivmx> the lessons of http://learn.appendto.com/lessons are good ?
[19:56:58] <ramkamx> Eviltwin: cheers :-) for the course.
[19:57:05] <Eviltwin> You're welcome
[19:57:17] <Eviltwin> ivmx: I have no idea
[19:57:26] <Eviltwin> ChiPoLy: You still have failed to ask your question
[19:57:59] <Eviltwin> ivmx: I don't really have a few hours to watch all of these and I already know all this stuff anyway
[19:58:13] <ramkamx> I've got a question regarding the company behind jquery, how is it funded / how do you survive?
[19:58:29] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: http://jquery.org/donate/
[19:58:44] <ramkamx> really ? that's all ?
[19:59:04] <Eviltwin> It's part of this: http://sfconservancy.org/
[19:59:09] <ChiPoLy> Eveltwin, I'm working with the jsfiddle demo
[20:03:10] <ramkamx> Eviltwin: if your teams get to europe or paris some day, the beers (or wine) are ready. Asynchonously.
[20:03:57] <felispeskus> what is the method that $(...) calls? is it filter?
[20:04:12] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: Ha, thanks
[20:04:30] <Eviltwin> felispeskus: More like .find
[20:04:36] <felispeskus> find. thanks
[20:06:07] <ramkamx> The difference between jquery and C++ ? you don't get a RTFM as an answer (lol)
[20:07:09] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: Well, there are some extensive jQuery manuals out there
[20:07:21] <Eviltwin> Including api.jquery.com
[20:07:39] <Eviltwin> Anything about what the jQuery functions do can be found there
[20:07:43] <Eviltwin> Including examples
[20:07:54] <Eviltwin> The problem is that jQuery is a part of JavaScript
[20:08:08] <Eviltwin> And while it's easy to get started, JavaScript is a beast
[20:08:16] <Eviltwin> And jQuery takes advantage of a lot of the more advanced features of JavaScript
[20:09:58] <ramkamx> Eviltwin: yep, i use a lot the site as a reference, however, i'm not a real programmer, and i miss a few of the concepts, help is very much appreciated
[20:10:30] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: Well if you understand most of operations of JavaScript, that garden thing I linked earlier will help with the more advanced stuff
[20:10:48] <Eviltwin> If you feel like you're missing a lot of JavaScript foundation, there's a good MDC doc on it
[20:11:52] <Eviltwin> I think this is the one: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide
[20:12:03] <ramkamx> it is :-)
[20:12:03] <Eviltwin> Starts really simple and works up through some of the more advanced topics
[20:12:14] <Eviltwin> The other one is to help understand the quirks
[20:12:22] <Eviltwin> The things a seasoned programmer is likely to find strange
[20:12:30] <Eviltwin> As they are unlike most other languages
[20:12:40] <yamahaalex37> how would i go about saying if this class also has this class
[20:12:50] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: Like as a selector?
[20:12:57] <yamahaalex37> so if class="menuItem1 active"
[20:13:06] <Eviltwin> $(".menuItem1.active")
[20:13:11] <Eviltwin> No space
[20:13:15] <yamahaalex37> ahh
[20:13:16] <yamahaalex37> no need for an if statement
[20:13:21] <Eviltwin> Clever huh? :P
[20:13:25] <yamahaalex37> haha yeah
[20:13:39] <yamahaalex37> im tryng to set the text in a different div depending on which menu item is active
[20:13:48] <Eviltwin> Also say you have something like var menuItems = $(".menuItem1");
[20:13:53] <yamahaalex37> so i guess i just need top copy that statement for each menu item?
[20:13:59] <Eviltwin> And you also want a collection of just the active ones
[20:14:09] <Eviltwin> You can do var actives = menuItems.filter(".active");
[20:14:32] <Eviltwin> Oh, you numbered your menu items? In the class?
[20:14:45] <yamahaalex37> yeah
[20:15:09] <Eviltwin> That's what IDs are about
[20:15:17] <Eviltwin> Classes are about similarity
[20:15:30] <Eviltwin> For example they should probably all have menuItem as a class
[20:15:52] <Eviltwin> And the active one(s) should also have active as a class
[20:15:57] <Eviltwin> So that you can do exactly what I shoed
[20:15:59] <Eviltwin> showed*
[20:16:21] <d4rklit3> hey
[20:16:25] <yamahaalex37> yeah but its stupid joomla giving me the menu class names Eviltwin
[20:16:33] <Eviltwin> Heh
[20:16:38] <d4rklit3> is it $("<div/>", {class : '.the-class' } ) or $("<div/>", {class : 'the-class'}); ?
[20:16:42] <yamahaalex37> or stupid me using joomla stuck with class names...
[20:16:47] <Eviltwin> d4rklit3: Latter
[20:16:56] <Eviltwin> d4rklit3: The dot only comes in for selectors
[20:17:00] <d4rklit3> ok
[20:17:01] <Eviltwin> Just like the # only comes in for selectors
[20:18:28] <yamahaalex37> Eviltwin, can i use:
[20:18:28] <yamahaalex37> if ($(".menuItem1.active")){
[20:18:28] <yamahaalex37> 	text = "Menu Item 1";
[20:18:28] <yamahaalex37> }
[20:18:43] <Eviltwin> To do what?
[20:19:18] <yamahaalex37> to say if menuItem1 is active, the text in this other div reads this
[20:19:35] <yamahaalex37> else, if menuTItem2 is active, this div text reads other
[20:20:17] <Eviltwin> It's a little strange and I can explain it if you want
[20:20:23] <Eviltwin> But you actually need to do $(".menuItem1.active") > 0
[20:20:28] <Eviltwin> Err
[20:20:29] <Eviltwin> $(".menuItem1.active").length > 0
[20:20:34] <Eviltwin> Or simply $(".menuItem1.active").length
[20:20:45] <ramkamx> yamahaalex37: $('#joomlai_d').bind('eventname',functiontofixthetext) ?
[20:21:16] <yamahaalex37> ramkamx, that confused me
[20:21:27] <Eviltwin> ramkamx: I'm not sure what that has to do with what he's doing
[20:21:47] <yamahaalex37> and Eviltwin, im basically checking if menuItem1.active has some value?
[20:22:07] <ramkamx> yamahaalex37, Eviltwin ah ok :) i'm going back to my beast :-) see you !
[20:22:10] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: So $(".menuItem1.active") returns a jQuery object or collection
[20:22:20] <Eviltwin> Even if nothing matches
[20:22:27] <Eviltwin> And objects are always truthy
[20:22:38] <Eviltwin> So to check if there's anything in the collection, we look at the .length property
[20:22:42] <Eviltwin> And see if it's greater than 0
[20:23:23] <ramkamx> thx everyone, bye now
[20:24:53] <yamahaalex37> Eviltwin, does this syntax look correct
[20:25:01] <yamahaalex37> ive not got it to work yet
[20:25:01] <yamahaalex37> if ($(".item-110.active").length){
[20:25:01] <yamahaalex37> 	$('#divMenuTitle span').text('Software')
[20:25:01] <yamahaalex37> }
[20:26:06] <Eviltwin> That means if there is at least one element with the classes item-110 and active, it will set the text of any/every span inside the element with ID divMenuTitle to "Software"
[20:26:38] <yamahaalex37> the divMenuTitle is not inside that div
[20:26:39] <styol> mebbe missing ; on the middle line
[20:26:48] <yamahaalex37> but its on the page, and this works in other cases $('#divMenuTitle span').text('Software')
[20:26:51] <ChiPoLy> here it goes:      http://jsfiddle.net/v4c3s/     <--- in Search type whatever value in array, example "Java".  After select, there is a new <input> appended to div#cart.... this last <input> does not respond to events
[20:27:12] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: Right, it's antwhere on the page
[20:27:31] <Eviltwin> I suggest you console.log($(".item-110.active")) before hand
[20:27:34] <Eviltwin> And see if there's anything in there
[20:27:54] <yamahaalex37> sk
[20:28:01] <yamahaalex37> ok
[20:29:07] <yamahaalex37> Eviltwin, undefined
[20:29:16] <yamahaalex37> http://eternaware.com/joom17/index.php/software
[20:29:20] <yamahaalex37> it is the software button, the first one on left
[20:29:26] <Eviltwin> ChiPoLy: This is because the element with that ID doesn't exist when you bind the change handler
[20:30:04] <yamahaalex37> quite confused:
[20:30:05] <yamahaalex37> console.log($(".current"))
[20:30:05] <yamahaalex37> jQuery
[20:30:05] <yamahaalex37> undefined
[20:30:37] <ChiPoLy> thats right.. any suggestions?
[20:31:07] <Eviltwin> ChiPoLy: I suggest either this: http://jsfiddle.net/W399t/ or http://jsfiddle.net/A5aVq/
[20:32:11] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: This is because you have a jQuery.noConflict() in http://eternaware.com/joom17/media/com_hikashop/js/hikashop.js
[20:32:23] <Eviltwin> It means jQuery isn't at $
[20:33:04] <Eviltwin> If you want to keep this noConflict
[20:33:25] <yamahaalex37> hmm
[20:33:31] <yamahaalex37> did i sent that no conflict
[20:33:32] <Eviltwin> I suggest that instead of $(document).ready(function(){...}) which may not work, you use jQuery(document).ready(function($){...})
[20:33:33] <yamahaalex37> how did you know htat
[20:33:43] <Eviltwin> This will allow you to use $ as jQuery inside of that function
[20:33:48] <Eviltwin> While letting it mean whatever else outside
[20:33:57] <yamahaalex37> you haxing my website, how did you know!
[20:33:57] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: It's called developer tools :P
[20:34:10] <yamahaalex37> hmm, im not sure what this no conflict is doing, is it bad?
[20:34:19] <Eviltwin> ?.noConflict @ yamahaalex37
[20:34:19] <bot-t> yamahaalex37, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[20:34:25] <ChiPoLy> I'll try http://jsfiddle.net/A5aVq/   because those new <inputs> are generated via ajax after products are added to cart and there are some attributes I need too, I cant declare them from the beggining
[20:34:35] <yamahaalex37> but im not sure im going to worry about it, because that if statement was working
[20:34:46] <yamahaalex37> i just started hovering buttons too fast to notice
[20:35:01] <Eviltwin> ChiPoLy: K
[20:35:09] <yamahaalex37> because i have statements set up for mouseove, and mouseout, and on mouseout i set the text back to default
[20:35:16] <Eviltwin> ChiPoLy: What version of jQuery are you working with? 1.7 or greater?
[20:35:33] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: I suggest you do what I said
[20:35:47] <yamahaalex37> ok, i will do that, but its not part of my new problem
[20:35:49] <Eviltwin> It's recommended on that page for noConflict
[20:36:02] <Eviltwin> Well it is jQuery("[selector]") should never be undefined
[20:36:57] <ChiPoLy> I'm not quite good with jQuery, I selected http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js   and they are giving jQuery JavaScript Library v1.7.1 for this source
[20:37:35] <Eviltwin> K
[20:37:39] <Eviltwin> That's fine then
[20:37:53] <Eviltwin> If you were using an older version, you would need to use .delegate instead of .on
[20:42:13] <yamahaalex37> Eviltwin, i got this working i am finishing the if statements for eeach page
[20:42:23] <yamahaalex37> sry i got a bit confused about the noconflict
[20:42:30] <yamahaalex37> do you think this could be a setting in this joomla extension
[20:42:32] <yamahaalex37> to just turn off
[20:42:37] <yamahaalex37> ive seen it before in some extensions
[20:42:45] <yamahaalex37> or does this mean that noconflict is turned on
[20:43:41] <Eviltwin> Doesn't look like a setting
[20:44:40] <yamahaalex37> why is $ jquery working fine then
[20:47:26] <mp___> Hello. I'm much more fo a Ruby dev than a JS one, so I'm having trouble finding a plugin that'll solve a particular (hopefully) common problem for me. I need to implement something similar to the left-hand refine functionality here: http://bit.ly/uETbzG
[20:47:27] <Eviltwin> Okay, it's fine as is but if you moved the jQuery include above the /joom17/media/com_hikashop/js/hikashop.js include
[20:47:32] <Eviltwin> It wouldn't work
[20:47:40] <Eviltwin> Because then jQuery.noConflict() would be defined
[20:47:46] <Eviltwin> When /joom17/media/com_hikashop/js/hikashop.js ran
[20:47:52] <Eviltwin> And it would run the noConflict
[20:48:04] <yamahaalex37> oh ok
[20:48:11] <yamahaalex37> i guess that include is part of hikashop
[20:48:20] <yamahaalex37> i will look into that if things stop working with hikashop, thanks Eviltwin
[20:48:43] <Eviltwin> No problem
[20:49:12] <mp___> alternatively, where do you first look when looking for jquery plugins? the jquery plugins site?
[20:49:14] <yamahaalex37> is jquery/javascript elseif or else if
[20:51:26] <Eviltwin> yamahaalex37: else if
[20:51:34] <Eviltwin> I almost never see elseif
[20:51:38] <Eviltwin> More frequently see elif or elsif
[20:51:50] <Eviltwin> But that's because I do Python and Perl
[20:51:58] <Eviltwin> mp___: The search on the site is pretty poor
[20:52:01] <Eviltwin> I usually turn to google
[20:52:09] <Eviltwin> "jQuery plugin" + what I'm looking for
[20:52:18] <Eviltwin> StackOverflow suggests this: http://datatables.net/
[20:52:39] <mp___> heh, we're already using that for something else
[20:53:31] <mp___> I wonder if that'd work at all with checkbox elements ...
[20:53:46] <bobdobbs> can I add my own functions to a chain ?
[20:54:00] <Eviltwin> Are you trying to filter results you already have or do you intend to use ajax to load the search results?
[20:54:14] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: Can you explain a little further?
[20:54:29] <mp___> Eviltwin: the server side will handle the actual searching. I just need the JS to send back what is/isn't checked
[20:54:53] <Eviltwin> mp___: That's actually rather easy
[20:55:00] <mp___> Eviltwin: If you know JS :)
[20:55:01] <Eviltwin> mp___: see ? .serialize
[20:55:01] <bot-t> mp___, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[20:55:09] <Eviltwin> mp___: And see ? .ajax
[20:55:10] <bot-t> mp___, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[20:55:33] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: I mean, like I can choose a selector and chain methods to do things in sequence. Shouls I be able to add my own methods to the chain?
[20:55:41] <mp___> hm, could start with just a bunch of stylized checkboxes and go from there I guess
[20:56:02] <mp___> the asos.com one does interesting things with ul/li, was hoping there was a plugin they were using
[20:56:04] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: Can you make a jsFiddle/pastebin example of a function you have and what you're trying to make this chain look like?
[20:56:30] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: sure. uno momento...
[20:56:31] <Eviltwin> mp___: I think beyond .serialize and .ajax, the bulk of what you have to do is CSS
[20:57:11] <mp___> but csss is haaaaaard :(
[20:57:12] <mp___> okay.
[20:57:14] <mp___> cheers :)
[20:58:16] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/NhEzZ/
[20:58:30] <Eviltwin> mp___: http://jsfiddle.net/qfgXM/
[20:58:57] <mp___> ahh, http://www.ryancramer.com/journal/entries/select_multiple/ also!
[20:59:04] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: Okay, do to this you need to do the same thing required for making a plugin
[20:59:40] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: Read from Getting Started through Maintaining Chainability: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[20:59:42] <bobdobbs> To do which part? You mean, to be able to add my own method to a chain?
[20:59:51] <bobdobbs> ok
[20:59:52] <mp___> Eviltwin: if nothing else, you've introduced me to jsfiddle.net
[20:59:52] <bobdobbs> thanks
[21:00:10] <Eviltwin> mp___: You're welcome :D
[21:00:28] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: Does this mean that I'm a whisker away from actually writing a plugin?
[21:00:53] <Eviltwin> Well while they call it a plugin
[21:00:58] <Eviltwin> And you need to do it to make a plugin
[21:01:00] <Eviltwin> You
[21:01:04] <Eviltwin> 're really using it as a convenience
[21:01:11] <bobdobbs> yeah
[21:01:42] <bobdobbs> I could do it a longhand way, but if I'm going to be calling the same methods all the time, I should at least try to be a little economic about it
[21:01:46] <Eviltwin> So some of the things they bring up will be relevant to you
[21:01:48] <Eviltwin> Other things won't
[21:01:52] <bobdobbs> ok
[21:02:06] <Eviltwin> The most important thing is the $.fn.myFunction = function() { ...; return this; }
[21:02:14] <bobdobbs> ok
[21:02:15] <Eviltwin> Where ... is your code
[21:02:16] <andorraclaim__> Hey friends, I was wondering if someone could give me someinsight to serializing input of form on submit to a JSON object
[21:02:21] <andorraclaim__> im fairly new to jquery
[21:02:26] <andorraclaim__> i know of the .serialize method
[21:02:34] <andorraclaim__> but i am unsure of how to connect the pieces
[21:02:38] <andorraclaim__> id appreciate any insight!
[21:02:40] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: Cool. Thanks. Reading the doc now
[21:03:21] <Eviltwin> andorraclaim__: You might want to see ? serializeArray
[21:03:22] <bot-t> andorraclaim__, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[21:03:31] <Eviltwin> It might at least get you headed in the right direction
[21:03:37] <andorraclaim__> hey, thanks!
[21:04:35] <andorraclaim__> would you happen to know if this works with jqm as well? i know jqm has methods of it's own but i have been able to use from projects pretty painlessly so far
[21:05:06] <Eviltwin> I don't but I suspect it does
[21:06:33] <crab> what's jqm?
[21:06:37] <Eviltwin> jQuery Mobile
[21:06:38] <andorraclaim__> jQuery Mobile
[21:06:51] <andorraclaim__> Eviltwin: thanks for the tip tho, i appreciate it!
[21:07:49] <mp___> actually while I'm here .. there's a small tiff here between two of the devs. One, who's used jqm & zepto, will refused to use jqm because it performs poorly. Another, who has only used jquery, is calling bullshit.
[21:08:03] <mp___> any opinions?
[21:08:32] <crab> mp_______________: beat them both with a stick and tell them to do some work instead of having tiffs
[21:09:08] <mp___> Well, they are, we're using zepto :)
[21:09:29] <crab> oh, all right then :-)
[21:10:11] <andorraclaim_> but the the thing about jqm and performance
[21:10:23] <andorraclaim_> you have to use it's own methods to do jquery like things
[21:10:31] <andorraclaim_> for instance instead of document.ready()
[21:10:39] <andorraclaim_> used pageinit() or pagecreate()
[21:10:44] <Eviltwin> There is no document.ready()
[21:10:49] <Eviltwin> There's a $(document).ready()
[21:10:51] <andorraclaim_> you notice the performance difference immediately
[21:10:54] <andorraclaim_> thats what i meant sorry
[21:11:32] <andorraclaim_> i have an old android running 2.1
[21:11:35] <andorraclaim_> and its pretty smooth
[21:11:42] <mp___> andorraclaim_: okay.
[21:11:44] <andorraclaim_> no page transitions tho (slideup, etc)
[21:11:49] <andorraclaim_> that only works well on iOS
[21:14:46] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: noob question: In this bit of code, what is '$' ?:  (function( $ )
[21:15:03] <Eviltwin> bobdobbs: Where?
[21:15:12] <coldhead> you are so not a noob, bobdobbs
[21:15:37] <coldhead> $ will be whatever is in the (...) at the end of that expression
[21:15:42] <bobdobbs> coldhead: thanks. :) But I'm a bit weak on the fundamentals.
[21:15:44] <donCams> bobdobbs, passing $ alias
[21:15:52] <Eviltwin> You know about $("span"), right?
[21:15:53] <coldhead> (function ( $ ) {..})(jQuery)
[21:16:07] <Eviltwin> Or $("#foo")
[21:16:13] <donCams> coldhead, i'm a noob. am I right when saying it's an alias?
[21:16:34] <Eviltwin> Yes
[21:16:53] <bobdobbs> I'm looking at the second chunk of example code here: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[21:16:55] <donCams> btw, I forgot what this expression is called ()(namespace);
[21:17:02] <bobdobbs> Is '$' an alias for a jquery object?
[21:17:05] <Eviltwin> Yes
[21:17:07] <Eviltwin> Well
[21:17:24] <Eviltwin> It's an alias for jQuery
[21:17:35] <crab> $ is an alias for jQuery inside the function
[21:17:44] <Eviltwin> And by default when loading jQuery
[21:17:56] <donCams> i think it has something to do with the scope of objects
[21:17:58] <coldhead> donCams: that's called an Alman function
[21:18:13] <crab> imagine: function foo(x){...} , foo(3), inside foo x is 3
[21:18:38] <crab> that's like (function (x){...})(3) (define and call the function without naming it)
[21:18:51] <donCams> closures :)
[21:18:58] <crab> which is like (function ($){...})(3), which is like ...(jQuery)
[21:19:20] <crab> donCams: they may be closures, but that doesn't affect $ in this case
[21:20:15] <donCams> ok. i'll have to refresh on closures. I had a firm grasp on it then I forgot about it again. sux
[21:20:36] <bobdobbs> happens to me all the time
[21:20:44] <bobdobbs> with most everything
[21:21:02] <crab> slippery things, concepts
[21:21:21] <donCams> hehe. one thing though, while I was using closures, i found it very powerful and was happy it's available in mostly every language, like PHP :)
[21:21:34] <crab> you need a keen eye and lightning-quick reflexes to prevent them from escaping
[21:21:51] <bobdobbs> If I gather correctly, lisp is totally based on closures too
[21:22:04] <Eviltwin> donCams: It's not in mostly every language
[21:22:06] <crab> "totally based"? that's a bit much
[21:22:07] <donCams> or, you use them always. how i wish it's like riding a bicycle
[21:22:21] <bobdobbs> crab: well, it uses them very heavily
[21:22:27] <coldhead> closures are native to lisp
[21:22:36] <yamahaalex37> how can i make background height 100% of screen, not page content
[21:22:42] <donCams> Eviltwin, oh well. i'm happy PHP has it. but i still have to refresh on the concept... :(
[21:22:48] <crab> is lisp totally based on parentheses?
[21:22:58] <yamahaalex37> as you can see, bg height changes with each page
[21:22:59] <yamahaalex37> http://eternaware.com/joom17/
[21:23:01] <coldhead> yes
[21:23:02] <donCams> window.height
[21:23:09] <coldhead> this is a good thing, crab
[21:23:11] <bobdobbs> crab: enough so to hurt my eyes whenever I look at lisp code
[21:23:19] <yamahaalex37> donCams, javascript?
[21:23:22] <coldhead> see for exaple the operator precedence table for lisp
[21:23:27] <coldhead> OH WAIT THERE ISN'T ONE
[21:23:54] <donCams> yamahaalex37, yes. coz there's no possible way for CSS to detect the user's browser's height
[21:24:02] * crab folds coldhead into a cdroissant
[21:24:15] <coldhead> feels good, man
[21:24:22] <donCams> makes me hungry
[21:24:26] <yamahaalex37> and theres no other way for me to say background image height: 100%?
[21:24:46] <bobdobbs> is a closure and a lambda the same thing?
[21:25:09] <coldhead> a lambda is an anonymous function
[21:25:19] <coldhead> the closure is a side effect of the function
[21:26:12] <donCams> yamahaalex37, sure you can. except if the user decides to resize his browser
[21:32:29] <coldhead> damn those users
[21:32:34] <coldhead> ruining everything
[21:35:13] <donCams> coldhead, yes. damn the users!
[21:35:32] <donCams> no one should use our apps! they just ruin it! :3
[21:36:47] <Oleander> i have img with 'click' event, when i double click, 'click' event handler is fired twice, how can i prevent this?
[21:37:45] <Eviltwin> Oleander: You might want to see ? dblclick
[21:37:45] <bot-t> Oleander, .dblclick(handler): Bind an event handler to the "dblclick" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/dblclick/
[21:39:30] <Oleander> Eviltwin: i attached dblclick handler, but then it fires 'click' twice then dbclick
[21:40:00] <Oleander> not one instead of the other, but both
[21:41:00] <Eviltwin> Oleander: Perhaps this? https://gist.github.com/399624
[21:42:39] <schnoomac> Hey i am doing $("#contest-tabs-watchers-tab").find('.info').text('(asdasd')); and on chrome it adds some stranger padding to the parent even though inspector can't see what is adding it. Has anyone run into this bug before ?

[22:12:32] <lng> after link is clicked, mobile app starts up
[22:15:47] <bobdobbs> Eviltwin: I rewrote my bit of code as a plugin, and just pasted it into my own behaviours file, but I'm still getting the same error message

[22:18:42] <ivmx> thx people, good nites
[22:18:45] <ivmx> bye
[22:20:55] <ngharo> bobdobbs: is that closure necessary?
[22:21:01] <ngharo> i think it works if you get rid of it
[22:22:10] <bobdobbs> hi ngharo. I was following the example on the document page for writing plugins.
[22:22:16] <bobdobbs> oh hay
[22:22:18] <bobdobbs> back soon

[23:31:12] <Clorith> I'm looking to gtraverse the DOM tree backwards up two levels (so I want to get to the 2nd <div> tag before my event triggering object), and I'm not quite sure how to acomplish this
[23:31:26] <Clorith> I know that I can get the closest one backwards with .closest
[23:32:06] <Zogot> use the .reverse
[23:32:31] <Zogot> store the selector in a car and reverse it
[23:32:41] <Zogot> then go down 2
[23:33:07] <Clorith> I'll give that a whirl, thank you =)
[23:33:20] <Zogot> sorry on mobile , car =var
[23:33:37] <Clorith> yeah, figured as much, hehe
[23:33:43] <Zogot> lol
[23:40:16] <bobdobbs> ngharo: thanks for that code fragment before. Sorry to get back to you late.
[23:41:09] <hejner> Hey, how do you stop anything from being typed in a input field? I thought this would work: http://jsfiddle.net/2nENJ/
[23:41:57] <Zogot> can't you give the attribute disabled
[23:42:15] <hejner> No, because later on I want it to be specific characters only.
[23:42:18] <muhoo> car cadr cons
[23:48:14] <hejner> After going for a hunch, I just got, it seems like keypress is the correct event, and not keyup or keydown.
[23:57:49] <jsvana_> How can I capture the backspace key without Firefox going back a page?
