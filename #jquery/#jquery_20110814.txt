[00:00:16] <buddyq> coldhead: Hmm.... I'm scared to do that since this is a Joomla component and the dev did that with wrapping. I'm using this component globally for many sites so I dont want to take that off and disable a ton of sites. Is there a way, I can register both jQuery and AG_jQuery to work?
[00:01:42] <coldhead> hey Brodingo
[00:02:01] <coldhead> buddyq: include a newer jQuery without that bogus wrapper
[00:02:21] <buddyq> ok, thats easy enough, then just use jQuery()?
[00:02:22] <coldhead> then just do AG_jQuery = jQuery.noConflict();
[00:02:28] <coldhead> and carry on with your live
[00:02:40] <buddyq> ok
[00:02:43] <coldhead> using jQuery is the better option
[00:02:56] <coldhead> but if you're commited to this AG_jQuery business it should work
[00:03:15] <coldhead> your wrapper seems to be setting jQuery to undefined
[00:03:19] <coldhead> and that shouldn't be
[00:03:27] <coldhead> it doesn't normally do that with noConflict()
[00:03:44] <coldhead> as this demonstrates http://jsfiddle.net/at5BW/
[00:09:03] <buddyq> coldhead: I'm not sure I follow that example. However, can you explain how this works? I loaded a new jquery on there and my page now works. However, there is now a new error in Firebug due to another framework using $ for mootools.
[00:09:38] <coldhead> you still need to call noConflict
[00:09:44] <buddyq> So here is what i need to do, just not sure where to put my code I guess, but the AG framework loads the file AG_jquery.js which is the jquery with the wrapper.
[00:09:49] <coldhead> before noConflict, $ === jQuery
[00:10:01] <coldhead> after noConflict, $ !== jQUery
[00:10:07] <coldhead> and $ is free for mootools to use
[00:10:11] <designvassal> before I go mad... there's nothing wrong with this sytax, right? http://pastie.org/2369463
[00:10:16] <designvassal> syntax*
[00:10:34] <buddyq> you think its this line? if(typeof AG_jQuery == "undefined")
[00:10:46] <coldhead> no
[00:10:55] <coldhead> designvassal: did you ask jshint.com ?
[00:11:04] <coldhead> it's better than people at spotting errors
[00:11:39] <coldhead> designvassal: you have an extra }
[00:12:08] <designvassal> ohhh
[00:12:09] <designvassal> awesome
[00:12:14] <designvassal> thanks. I didn't know about jshint
[00:12:20] <designvassal> just jslint
[00:12:31] <designvassal> and jslint is annoying for little stuff
[00:13:52] <coldhead> buddyq: you know what? you can probably just fix it by making it noConflict() instead of noConflict(true)
[00:14:00] <coldhead> i hadn't seen that argument
[00:14:10] <buddyq> ok
[00:14:11] <coldhead> but that makes jQuery disappear altogether
[00:14:17] <coldhead> which would be why your plugins can't find it
[00:14:36] <coldhead> god knows why that is being done and isn't being documented
[00:14:40] <coldhead> these are truly the last days
[00:16:48] <buddyq> coldhead: I would guess your right... but I just suspect that the dev obviously was using this as a way for conflict solution.
[00:17:14] <buddyq> coldhead: what does this do? if(typeof AG_jQuery == "undefined")
[00:19:15] <coldhead> it test if AG_jQuery has been defined already
[00:19:22] <coldhead> tests*
[00:20:02] <mcbtay> if i have like 3 or 4 selects
[00:20:12] <mcbtay> how can i loop over them in jquery and get the values?
[00:20:44] <root_> use foreach
[00:20:51] <coldhead> var vals = []; $('select').each(function () {vals.push( $(this).val();});
[00:22:02] <mcbtay> diego45: didn't think javascript had a foreach?
[00:22:26] <diego45> jquery ... not javascript
[00:22:45] <mcbtay> excuse me
[00:22:49] * coldhead twiddles his thumbs
[00:23:01] <diego45> coldhead your code is nice xD
[00:23:14] <coldhead> does the job!
[00:23:30] <mcbtay> about to attempt :P
[00:23:40] <diego45> perfect !
[00:23:47] <diego45> @c0derx11
[00:24:12] <mcbtay> could i push the vals of the select as the indeces of the array?
[00:24:30] <diego45> yes, u can
[00:24:48] <mcbtay> vals[index].push(otherval)?
[00:25:03] <diego45> foreach too
[00:25:16] <coldhead> javascript arrays don't work like that
[00:25:18] <designvassal> does anyone use the plugin qtip? I'm trying to   content: { url: 'file.html' } - but nothing shows up.
[00:25:22] <diego45> exit
[00:25:26] <diego45> quit
[00:25:33] <coldhead> you would have do do vals[index] = otherval;
[00:25:49] <mcbtay> hmmm
[00:26:09] <designvassal> does the site have to be online for an ajax request to work?
[00:26:54] <coldhead> yeah, you can't do AJAX when you just load up the file:///
[00:27:03] <coldhead> needs to be localhost or somesuch, designvassal
[00:27:30] <designvassal> gotcha. thanx that saves me house of frustration ;)
[00:28:13] <designvassal> hours*
[00:45:36] <vol7ron> coldhead: what?
[00:45:55] <vol7ron> the site doesn't need to be online
[00:46:12] <vol7ron> I think you can refer to local files through ajax
[00:49:40] <coldhead> isn't that exactly what i said? file:/// doesn't work
[00:49:59] <coldhead> sorry vol7ron, it's my first day using IRC
[00:50:07] <coldhead> i'm still learning how to communicate in writing
[00:50:59] <chjj> you cant send xhr's using the file: protocol
[00:51:01] <Woet> a) place fingers on the keyboard b) hit the relevant keys c) repeat b until sentence is composed d) press enter
[00:51:06] <chjj> that would be a gigantic security hole
[00:51:10] <Woet> repeat a-d until problem is resolved
[00:51:49] <chjj> coldhead: what irc client are you using? you should use irssi if youre not already ;)
[00:52:02] <chjj> irssi === irc client of the gods
[00:52:45] <coldhead> i think it might be too advanced for me
[00:54:01] <sam350> @chjj what do u recommend on mac
[00:54:09] <chjj> irssi
[00:54:23] <vol7ron> coldhead: no, you said you can't and I said I think you can
[00:54:26] <chjj> i think it can compile on osx
[00:54:30] <chjj> let me check
[00:54:33] <sam350> http://adlr.info/?Irssix
[00:54:37] <sam350> but is the port goo
[00:54:39] <sam350> good
[00:55:01] <sam350> I am using an XChat port, XChat aqua and it's pretty good
[00:55:05] <chjj> hmm, not sure
[00:55:16] <chjj> i stopped using xchat once i discovered irssi
[00:55:26] <sam350> aside from some problems with scripts which run fine on pc version
[00:55:40] <chjj> but im on debian, dont know about osx
[00:55:41] <vol7ron> it may be
[00:55:47] <coldhead> it never works for me, vol7ron
[00:55:47] <sam350> cant get tor working with xchat aqua, but can on linux xchat
[00:56:35] <sam350> god id love to use debian full time
[00:56:42] <sam350> but cant give up some osx progs
[00:57:15] <chjj> yeah, deb is pretty sexy
[00:57:49] <chjj> i love how lightweight i can make it
[00:58:05] <sam350> working with one os would be sexy no matter what it's called but yah
[00:58:37] <chjj> oh, yeah, i always have a windows installation on my disk "just in case"
[00:58:55] <sam350> oh yes.. i love taht too.. i boot directly to a prompt and load window manager only if needed
[00:59:24] <sam350> yah speakin of windows.. i had such a mind fuck about it yesterday at work
[00:59:34] <chjj> nice, yeah, i dont have a display manager or have an xserver start automatically, etc
[01:00:21] <sam350> I was thinking of why there is so much fragmentation of os and software in general, which actually the second is partly caused by the first
[01:00:32] <sam350> but i was thinking lets all have one os
[01:00:35] <sam350> one way of doing things
[01:00:42] <sam350> even if it sucks in some ways
[01:00:58] <sam350> and I realized I basically described windows
[01:00:59] <chjj> i think that might be what every user wants
[01:01:01] <chjj> oh
[01:01:07] <chjj> wait, i take that back temporarily
[01:01:38] <chjj> im okay with windows, i grew up using it
[01:01:39] <sam350> but I gotta say, if windows did everything the way linux does (file system, everything a file, etc)
[01:01:46] <sam350> then Id be ok with it
[01:01:49] <chjj> i just like linux better because i became a programmer
[01:02:06] <sam350> but lots of programmers, some of the best, only use windows
[01:02:12] <sam350> take for instance john carmack
[01:02:22] <sam350> he is programming on and for windows
[01:02:29] <sam350> much of them
[01:02:31] <sam350> the time
[01:02:45] <chjj> i dont know, i dont have programming heroes, im just saying for me, i ended up liking linux more because i became a programmer
[01:03:02] <sam350> do u use linux for programming, or do u also program for linux
[01:03:06] <chjj> thats why, i mean, thats my story, its a fact, its how it pertains to me, i could care less who uses what
[01:03:09] <coldhead> john carmack is not a typical programmer
[01:03:14] <coldhead> he progams windows games
[01:03:22] <coldhead> he's not designing languages
[01:03:34] <sam350> we are in #jquery so I'm first assuming you are a web dev, but wonder if you program for linux too
[01:03:36] <coldhead> he's not matz or john resig or larry wall or guido or linus :)
[01:03:41] <chjj> i dont care, im not saying windows cant be good for programming
[01:03:48] <coldhead> i will say that
[01:03:51] <sam350> coldhead: good point
[01:03:52] <coldhead> windows is shit for programming
[01:04:05] <sam350> i agree
[01:04:17] <sam350> cannot BELIEVE how many people at google program on it
[01:04:24] <sam350> and adapt eveything to work on windows
[01:04:44] <chjj> huh?
[01:04:44] <sam350> use cygwin and all kind of bs to do what linux would do easily and MUCH faster
[01:04:45] <coldhead> windows isn't a supported OS inside google anymore
[01:04:57] <chjj> yeah, i cant live without cygwin on windows
[01:04:59] <sam350> you can use whatvre you want
[01:05:03] <chjj> i dont see how anyone can
[01:05:04] <sam350> i know people who work there
[01:05:11] <chjj> the windows shell is so unusable :(
[01:05:17] <sam350> powershell aint bad
[01:05:38] <sam350> take a look at docs for evetyhing at google
[01:05:45] <sam350> google app engine stuff for instance
[01:05:57] <sam350> there are TONS of pages documenting and supporting windows
[01:06:05] <chjj> so?
[01:06:06] <Lampoon> so are you
[01:06:18] <sam350> so.. I was just responding to coldhead
[01:06:30] <sam350> and saying how surprised I am at it
[01:06:40] <chjj> why wouldnt they provide documentation for windows? theyre giants, and windows is *the* operating system currently
[01:07:14] <sam350> guess so.. but noone's ever given me a good reason for what you jsut stated
[01:07:21] <sam350> that it's *the* os
[01:07:37] <Woet> sam350: linkinus is the best irc client for mac
[01:07:37] <Woet> by far
[01:07:40] <sam350> I've been using them all for almost 30 years, and can't say myself
[01:07:40] <chjj> well, windows holds the marketshare for better or worse
[01:07:46] <chjj> reasons dont matter beyond that
[01:08:04] <Woet> just like coda is the best coding program for mac, by far :)
[01:08:13] <chjj> i heard there is a gui version of irssi for osx i think
[01:08:27] <sam350> linkinus I'll check it
[01:08:42] <coldhead> the browser is going to be the default OS soon enough anyway
[01:08:43] <chjj> but, that seems to destroy the spirit of irssi, its supposed to be a terminal client :(
[01:08:49] <coldhead> and the JVM on the server
[01:08:53] <chjj> that way i confuse it with the terminal and end up saying:
[01:08:55] <chjj> git status
[01:08:58] <chjj> ;)
[01:09:12] <sam350> haha
[01:09:24] <Woet> coldhead: what? JVM?
[01:09:25] <chjj> wheres the fun if i cant do that?
[01:09:32] <sam350> chjj I can see how you werent kidding about liking your stuff lightweight
[01:09:45] <coldhead> the java virtual machine, Woet
[01:09:50] <Woet> i know what it means
[01:09:51] <chjj> yeah, im too much of a minimalist
[01:09:58] <Woet> why is it the future of the server OS?!
[01:09:59] <coldhead> via scala and clojure and jruby and jython
[01:10:14] <coldhead> because it's easy to run everything on it now!
[01:10:15] <chjj> why are people mentioning the virtual machine of a terrible language in this channel?
[01:10:28] <Woet> you mean everything written in the ugliest language ever?
[01:10:28] <coldhead> forget the language
[01:10:32] <coldhead> it's not just for java
[01:10:59] <fotoflo> if i want to filter an array, creating a new array with only the unique elements, is there a good quick way to do that?
[01:11:30] <Woet> i'm not sure where you work coldhead, but JVM is definitely not the future
[01:11:51] <coldhead> hahahah Woet, it sounds like i'm trolling but in 18 months, we shall see :)
[01:12:20] <coldhead> i don't work with JVM at work yet either but i can see where it's heading
[01:12:50] <coldhead> why wouldn't we converge on an "enterprise" platform that everything runs on, often faster than in native implementations
[01:12:51] <sam350> fotoflo I'd make a function which returns an array.
[01:13:25] <fotoflo> sam350: would you use filter() to do that?
[01:13:32] <sam350> instead of modifying the current array
[01:13:35] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.unique/
[01:14:07] <sam350> yah, use the link that coldhead said.
[01:15:03] <sam350> unless the array is custom and elements
[01:15:17] <sam350> in that case, search for a nice little function that does it
[01:15:34] <sam350> or write one that takes an array as a parameter
[01:15:40] <fotoflo> id like to be able to write this
[01:15:44] <fotoflo> it doesn't seem that difficult
[01:15:59] <sam350> it isnt.. make a global var inside the function
[01:16:04] <sam350> iterate the array you passed it
[01:16:17] <sam350> and compare each element to the current item
[01:16:28] <sam350> and delete out if its the same
[01:17:54] <sam350> thing is, there's always at least an edge case or two
[01:18:11] <sam350> so if it's for production and will be working with data you dont know about, like from API's
[01:18:26] <sam350> you are best off getting one someone else wrote and has been tested by tons of people
[01:18:36] <sam350> javascript is so retarded, you will be bitten
[01:18:48] <sam350> I love it as much as you guys do, probably my favorite language
[01:19:47] <sam350> but you gotta admit it's retarded..  typeof returns object for [] an {}
[01:19:53] <sam350> [] is not an object
[01:19:58] <sam350> but js thinks it is
[01:20:49] <chjj> it is an object actually
[01:20:52] <chjj> =/
[01:21:06] <chjj> the stupid part
[01:21:12] <chjj> is typeof null === 'object'
[01:21:14] <chjj> thats dead wrong
[01:21:43] <chjj> strict mode should have changed that imo
[01:23:51] <sam350> so in other languages, an array is an object?
[01:24:08] <chjj> ?
[01:24:16] <sam350> well im asking cuz way you said it i cant tell
[01:24:24] <sam350> 'it is an object actually'
[01:24:33] <sam350> you mean, it is because js says it is? or why?
[01:24:37] <chjj> i mean its an object is javascript
[01:24:43] <sam350> lol
[01:24:53] <chjj> technically every type is an object in javascript except for the null and undefined types
[01:25:01] <sam350> I see I see
[01:25:18] <sam350> so string is an object.. to ruby
[01:25:23] <chjj> strings and numbers are even objects, except theyre immutable
[01:25:24] <sam350> and java
[01:25:44] <chjj> im not a ruby programmer
[01:25:57] <sam350> but u know ruby and python make everyhting an object
[01:26:06] <sam350> but  Ithink they are smart enough to say they are typeof string
[01:26:11] <sam350> thats why my beef with js is
[01:26:14] <sam350> on that issue
[01:26:36] <chjj> javascript is almost completely duck typed, were lucky we even have primitive types like strings and numbers
[01:26:44] <chjj> so typeof can return the type name
[01:27:48] <sam350> yes we are lucky :)
[01:28:12] <chjj> but typeof null is just wrong
[01:28:25] <chjj> null is not an object =/
[01:28:57] <sam350> maybe they were planning on making it one too
[01:29:11] <chjj> i dont think so, i think it was just a mistake
[01:29:31] <sam350> if it were I, I would make it an object which held a property of the previous value of it (if any)
[01:29:50] <sam350> and another property which says what it was attempted to be assigned
[01:29:59] <sam350> is just crazy or a good idea?
[01:30:04] <chjj> hmm, sounds like it would be harsh on memory
[01:30:27] <chjj> especially for huge objects you want to get cleaned up
[01:30:35] <chjj> like a giant 50kb string
[01:30:47] <chjj> you better give access to free() if you do that
[01:30:48] <sam350> ohh well why not a pointer to it
[01:31:05] <sam350> and if it's gone, it puts a base64 image representing it
[01:31:16] <sam350> that is a tiny image to show a string
[01:31:23] <chjj> ...huh?
[01:31:55] <sam350> don't put the string in the 'previous' field
[01:32:00] <sam350> put a pointer to it
[01:32:13] <sam350> and if it doesnt exist anywhere anymore
[01:32:16] <sam350> bc you cleaned it up
[01:32:20] <chjj> well its only worth putting a pointer if the memory is still there
[01:32:40] <chjj> i suppose you could put a pointer there and hope that its still there, like a weak reference
[01:32:55] <chjj> i dont see it being terribly useful though
[01:33:19] <sam350> what about the other property- the line that tried to assign to it
[01:33:38] <chjj> what other property?
[01:34:42] <sam350> the one I suggested
[01:35:25] <sam350> a property containing the line which attempted to assign to the null object
[01:35:42] <chjj> "the line"?
[01:35:54] <sam350> yes
[01:36:10] <sam350> so it might contain
[01:36:28] <sam350> person
[01:36:33] <sam350> or getPerson()
[01:36:35] <chjj> now im confused, you want to make null an object, but have it contain these special properties for when a null object is instantiated?
[01:36:37] <sam350> so I can look at that
[01:36:52] <sam350> yes when instantiated that property is null
[01:37:04] <sam350> so mynull=null() has them all
[01:37:06] <sam350> but they are blank
[01:37:10] <sam350> but if I do
[01:37:18] <sam350> person = getPerson()
[01:37:32] <sam350> person is null object
[01:38:01] <sam350> but with property called 'attempt' with value of getPerson()
[01:38:08] <sam350> you can try it again
[01:38:14] <sam350> just by eval
[01:38:16] <sam350> or
[01:38:34] <chjj> oh i see what youre saying i guess
[01:38:37] <sam350> could just look at it to know what went wrong
[01:39:07] <sam350> WebORB ever heard of that
[01:39:09] <chjj> well if something goes wrong, your function shouldnt be returning null, it should throw, that way youd get a stack trace, all the info youd ever need
[01:39:31] <sam350> oh yes good point
[01:39:44] <sam350> sounds like what the lead architect on my project at work would say
[01:39:59] <chjj> dont know if thats a compliment or insult
[01:40:05] <sam350> WebORB, off the subject, but look at this page.. very scary http://www.themidnightcoders.com/develop-ria/guided-tour.html
[01:40:53] <sam350> those big magnifying glasses over the screenshots
[01:41:01] <sam350> WTF
[01:41:15] <sam350> and the cartoon graphic of the server hallway
[01:41:42] <sam350> and the little plant/tree graphic
[01:41:52] <sam350> omg  http://www.themidnightcoders.com/uploads/pics/ws_modeldrivendev_01.jpg
[01:43:14] <sam350> Deploy your DLL?s into WebORB and bam! Your services immediately show up in WebORB?s Service Browser making them available for all kinds of goodness
[01:43:57] <sam350> also states - It?s pretty amazing when you can click a button with your mouse and all of your code is generated
[01:44:47] <sam350> and this is the best : You could configure security via Command Line, but why?
[01:49:40] <sam350> cya nice talkin
[01:50:41] <madprops> im trying to check if an image is inside a div, im using if(($this).parents('#post_holder').length > 0){ } but it never results positive, even though it is inside that div
[01:50:54] <madprops> im wondering if the problem is $(this) is not working in that context
[01:53:53] <Lochlan> #('#post_holder img').length > 0
[01:53:56] <Lochlan> would not work?
[01:54:40] <coldhead> what IS the context, madprops?
[01:54:47] <coldhead> where is this code running?
[01:54:54] <coldhead> in an event handler?
[01:55:10] <madprops> coldhead, its a lightbox code
[01:55:21] <coldhead> ?p @ madprops
[01:55:21] <bot-t> madprops, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:55:27] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[01:55:27] * bot-t sighs
[01:57:53] <madprops> coldhead, this is the code
[01:57:57] <madprops> i import it in the head
[01:58:16] <seivan> Does anyone know how to create a tag and replace it's content all in one go
[01:58:17] <seivan>     $("#flash").html( @template_flash( flash: window.Twoogle.flash ) )
[01:58:22] <seivan> Problem is that #flash might not exist
[01:58:34] <madprops> coldhead, what im trying to do is in the last method close()
[01:59:45] <madprops> Lochlan, i didnt understand that
[02:00:47] <seivan> do I need to do a $("body").append("..div...")
[02:01:52] <Lochlan> well to check if there is an image inside #post_holder, then do $('#post_holder img').length > 0
[02:04:04] <madprops> Lochlan, oh ok but i meant a specific image
[02:04:57] <Lochlan> ok, well paste your code where the bot said
[02:07:19] <madprops> crlv v fail
[02:07:30] <madprops> http://jsfiddle.net/fzWdx/
[02:07:55] <mbrevda> anyone know why this would be failing? $.get('www.globes.co.il/data/js/mddim.en.js', function(d){console.log(d)})
[02:08:37] <madprops> Lochlan, coldhead nvm, i think im taking a different route :d
[02:15:50] <jeffreyjames> can someone tell me what's new since jquery 1.4 that prevents this from working? http://pastie.org/2369737
[02:17:08] <jeffreyjames> v1.4.2 - to be exact
[02:19:11] <coldhead> none of that looks controversial, jeffreyjames
[02:19:46] <jeffreyjames> if I use 1.5 instead of 1.4.2 it does not funciton
[02:19:49] <jeffreyjames> function*
[02:20:14] <coldhead> does it throw any kind of error?
[02:20:53] <coldhead> all the functions you are using are pretty stable
[02:20:54] <jeffreyjames> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'extend' of undefined
[02:21:12] <jeffreyjames> is the only error i see in the chrome JS console
[02:21:33] <jeffreyjames> unless the plugin I'm using is doing the damage
[02:21:46] <jeffreyjames> http://projects.nickstakenburg.com/tipped/
[02:21:57] <jeffreyjames> but that guy
[02:22:00] <jeffreyjames> is no dummy
[02:23:33] <jeffreyjames> oops, I fixed the major problem. that JS menu functions now
[02:24:03] <jeffreyjames> the style is just not good. maybe a CSS selector conflict
[02:27:31] <jeffreyjames> hah, nm I'm wrong. I did not fix it
[02:28:02] <jeffreyjames> the only JS I'm running is jquery and menu.js
[02:28:19] <jeffreyjames> if I use 1.5 or later menu.js does not function
[02:28:39] <jeffreyjames> (menu.js being the link I posted)
[02:31:06] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to change the text from -webkit-validation-bubble-message
[02:31:16] <SoulRaven> using js or something else?
[02:34:41] <jeffreyjames> ok
[02:34:45] <jeffreyjames> I have two versions of a site
[02:35:09] <jeffreyjames> the only difference is including jq 1.4.2 or jq 1.5
[02:35:19] <jeffreyjames> 1.4.2: http://minnewaskaag.org/development
[02:35:35] <jeffreyjames> 1.5: http://minnewaskaag.org/development/indexjq15.html
[02:35:43] <jeffreyjames> what is breaking 1.5?
[02:37:20] <ajpiano> the fact that your link to 1.5 is 404ing
[02:37:21] <ajpiano> ?
[02:37:30] <maqr> heh
[02:37:35] <jeffreyjames> it isn't for me
[02:37:41] <ajpiano> it is for me
[02:38:16] <maqr> it's definitely 404
[02:38:23] <maqr> probably a relative path thing
[02:38:31] <jeffreyjames> how about this? http://www.minnewaskaag.org/development/indexjq15.html
[02:38:40] <jeffreyjames> I had weird "didn't add www" issues a few weeks ago
[02:38:51] <ajpiano> the page isn't 404ing
[02:38:53] <ajpiano> the link to jquer yis
[02:39:05] <ajpiano> http://ajpiano.com/cap/3d2d4d.png
[02:39:39] <jeffreyjames> sry
[02:39:40] <jeffreyjames> fixed
[02:39:43] <jeffreyjames> refresh
[02:40:41] <maqr> also, you're really going with 'Get your worship on.'? :P
[02:40:56] <jeffreyjames> hah, if the pastor doesn't tell me not to
[02:41:05] <jeffreyjames> ;)
[02:41:13] <maqr> :P
[02:41:41] <jeffreyjames> he probably won't mind then the congregation will say something then I'll charge him to fix it
[02:41:55] <jeffreyjames> jk, I'm not that much of an ass
[02:48:57] <jeffreyjames> Honestly I can't even think of a wild guess as to why it's not working with JQ 1.5 and above
[02:49:17] <jedimind> can anyone recmomend a decent HTML5 validation fallback for jquery mobile ? (ie lightweight)
[02:49:24] <jedimind> form validation that is
[02:49:39] <maqr> jedimind: just write good html5 and it'll do what it can?
[02:49:58] <jedimind> ...
[02:50:38] <maqr> jedimind: if you have things like <input required>, any browser that supports it is going to validate it, probably before jquery can
[02:50:45] <jedimind> no shit
[02:50:49] <jedimind> thats why i asked for a fallback
[02:50:52] <jedimind> for browsers who dont supporti t
[02:51:01] <jedimind> if you're not going to read the question, dont answer
[02:51:41] <maqr> you wrote that question awkwardly, but whatever, nevermind
[02:53:20] <jeffreyjames> if someone wants to figure out how to get my site cooking with 1.5 I'll be way nicer than jedimind about your helping me
[02:53:43] <jedimind> <3
[03:02:15] <jeffreyjames> my night: in the last 5 hours I've found 3 ways of putting a google map in a tooltip that don't work, and the one that will work needs jquery 1.5 or higher. Then, for some reason, the site is broken if I use 1.5 or higher.
[03:02:52] <jeffreyjames> fml
[03:10:59] <coldhead> programming is hard
[03:11:27] <Acorn> Do event bubble up through iframes? Or is every iframe completely isolated?
[03:11:31] <Acorn> *events
[03:14:11] <jeffreyjames> just so I'm not sitting here with false hopes, is anyone looking at those pages or should I go post on a forum and cross my fingers?
[03:15:08] <jeffreyjames> no disrespect, I just can't do anything until I solve this so I'm more or less just staring at my screen
[03:15:25] <chjj> Acorn: certain events like "load" will fire on iframes
[03:15:39] <maqr> jeffreyjames: sorry, i got nothing, but it's not super clear to me what the problem really is
[03:16:04] <maqr> at least some of your page seems to load and work fine
[03:16:12] <jeffreyjames> yeah the whole page "loads"
[03:16:14] <Acorn> chjj: if I have my javascript running in the top level of a page, do I have access to the individual sub-frames?
[03:16:17] <jeffreyjames> it's the hovers
[03:16:31] <jeffreyjames> hover over "what we do" on this page: http://minnewaskaag.org/development/
[03:16:47] <maqr> seems fine?
[03:16:51] <jeffreyjames> yes, it is
[03:16:55] <jeffreyjames> now try on this page: http://minnewaskaag.org/development/indexjq15.html
[03:17:04] <jeffreyjames> for me, the menu doesn't come down
[03:17:12] <jeffreyjames> it doesn't show the div
[03:17:23] <maqr> oh, so it doesn't
[03:17:49] <jeffreyjames> the only difference is "<script language="javascript" src="js/jq15.js" ></script>"
[03:18:08] <jeffreyjames> instead of 1.4.2 I'm trying to use 1.5 (or greater)
[03:18:23] <maqr> jeffreyjames: start setting breakpoints in firebug in the hover functions
[03:18:29] <darkknightcz> hi, does someone have an idea how to make this working (or equivalent code)? (.items are <img>, error = TypeError) - http://pastebin.com/51Pa9GG4
[03:19:26] <jeffreyjames> marq, I'm not quite sure what you mean
[03:19:31] <jeffreyjames> maqr*
[03:21:00] <maqr> jeffreyjames: do you have firebug?
[03:21:15] <jeffreyjames> i'm getting it now
[03:21:21] <maqr> jeffreyjames: ... how did you get this far?
[03:21:29] <jeffreyjames> just reinstalled osx
[03:21:38] <jeffreyjames> and used chrome js console
[03:22:00] <jeffreyjames> haven't needed firebug since chrome
[03:22:15] <maqr> oh, well, chrome's debugger can do this too
[03:22:40] <maqr> jeffreyjames: you just want to find your hover() functions and set breakpoints on them, then you can step through and examine the variables to figure out what's going wrong
[03:24:22] <coldhead> jeffreyjames: you're animating the height on hover but you don't seem to be unhiding the menus
[03:24:48] <coldhead> i can see the height changing but the element is display:none
[03:25:07] <coldhead> try .stop().show().animate({etc})
[03:26:53] <jeffreyjames> oh
[03:26:55] <jeffreyjames> that works
[03:27:03] <jeffreyjames> I wonder why it worked without that in 1.4
[03:29:08] <coldhead> it's better not to wonder about things like that
[03:29:14] <coldhead> leave that to the dev team
[03:29:20] <coldhead> let's try to move on with our lives
[03:29:35] <jeffreyjames> heh, sounds good to me.
[03:29:40] <jeffreyjames> fixed: http://pastie.org/2369911
[03:40:19] <coldhead> happy hacking, jeffreyjames
[03:41:29] <jeffreyjames> thanks. and thanx for the help! I'd be sitting here pulling my hair out soon enough ;)
[03:44:20] <darkknightcz> does someone have an idea how to make this working (or equivalent code)? (.items are <img>, error = TypeError) - http://pastebin.com/51Pa9GG4
[03:45:38] <Foxandxss> uh
[03:45:41] <Foxandxss> next time use jsfiddle
[03:45:52] <Foxandxss> and...im not jquery guru
[03:45:56] <Foxandxss> but .each is there for something
[03:47:09] <darkknightcz> well, javascript (same as java) doesnt have foreach
[03:47:28] <Foxandxss> but you're using jquery
[03:47:36] <Foxandxss> anyway, you have a for (var item in items)
[03:47:40] <Foxandxss> but use .each
[03:47:54] <Foxandxss> http://api.jquery.com/each/
[03:48:12] <Foxandxss> $('.items').each(function(item) { do something with the item });
[03:48:25] <Foxandxss> you dont have to do that kind of 'for'
[03:48:40] <darkknightcz> oh, .each
[03:48:48] <darkknightcz> thanks
[03:49:45] <Foxandxss> and use jsfiddle, so we can edit it, run it and see what happens without figuring it out
[03:50:09] <darkknightcz> Foxandxss: ok - same TypeError like with for loop
[03:50:37] <Foxandxss> yeah, that was just for fixing the loop
[03:50:41] <Foxandxss> the error is still there
[03:51:34] <darkknightcz> http://jsfiddle.net/FHm6q/
[03:51:47] <darkknightcz> i add only one element with .items in there
[03:52:10] <Foxandxss> I see
[03:53:04] <Foxandxss> im thinking
[03:54:09] <darkknightcz> hmm, console in chrome says - TypeError -> ... type: undefined_method
[03:56:28] <Foxandxss> darkknightcz, have you tried: item.attr("src").replace('-hover', ''); ?
[03:56:46] <darkknightcz> that will print only that text, i need to change it
[03:56:51] <darkknightcz> but i figured out where is problem
[03:57:12] <darkknightcz> $(".items").each(function(item) { document.write(item); }); prints only indexes
[03:57:58] <darkknightcz> i have an idea
[03:58:19] <Foxandxss> use, function (index, item)
[03:58:31] <darkknightcz> yeeah
[03:58:31] <darkknightcz> http://jsfiddle.net/FHm6q/1/
[03:59:05] <Foxandxss> is that working?
[03:59:08] <darkknightcz> yep
[03:59:12] <darkknightcz> thanks for helping :)
[03:59:18] <Foxandxss> well, another problem out
[04:03:39] <darkknightcz> btw, one another question, any idea how to work with #lipsum in address? (or hint how its named)
[04:04:17] <Foxandxss> darkknightcz, I don't know what are you talking about
[04:06:27] <darkknightcz> Foxandxss: for example i will access this address http://google.com/#idofelement  and that #idofelement will "run some method"
[04:07:43] <Foxandxss> can you give me a real example? :P
[04:08:57] <darkknightcz> Foxandxss: just type something into google and look at address :)
[04:10:29] <Foxandxss> darkknightcz, didn't notice that, so I don't know what they do :P
[04:11:16] <darkknightcz> well, i saw that on many websites (not only google and not only big websites :) ), nevermind, i will figure it out :)
[04:12:15] <Foxandxss> darkknightcz, maybe that is about single page apps
[04:12:33] <Foxandxss> seems so
[04:12:39] <Foxandxss> hash-based navigation
[04:14:38] <coldhead> ?g ben alman bbq
[04:14:39] <bot-t> coldhead, Ben Alman » jQuery BBQ: Back Button & Query Library - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[04:14:52] <coldhead> that is a nice hash navigation lib ^^
[04:15:04] <Foxandxss> darkknightcz, there you go :)
[04:15:13] <maqr> i've been using backbone.js and i like it a lot, it also handles history for you
[04:15:27] <Foxandxss> the library I use for templating have hash-based nav, but don't need ir right now
[04:16:14] <Foxandxss> maqr, how is backbone? I read a lot about it
[04:16:39] <darkknightcz> ok, thanks :)
[04:16:49] <maqr> Foxandxss: it's really solid, very easy to use too
[04:16:58] <maqr> Foxandxss: i'm using it with coffeescript and i'm pretty sure this is the best js i've ever written
[04:17:03] <maqr> err, not written, as it's coffee :)
[04:17:15] <Foxandxss> uhuh, advanced stuff
[04:17:22] <Foxandxss> Im using now knockoutjs
[04:17:29] <Foxandxss> is easier to use for .net developers
[04:17:45] <Foxandxss> is standard but with some concepts from .net
[04:18:06] <maqr> i've heard good things about that too
[04:18:38] <maqr> right now i'm just fighting with simplemodal
[04:18:41] <Foxandxss> pretty active community and that is important for a newbie like me
[04:19:40] <Foxandxss> I'm gonna need a modal dialog today
[04:20:10] <maqr> is there some way to delay javascript by one tick? because i think that'd solve my probelm
[04:20:58] <Foxandxss> setTimeout?
[04:21:11] <Foxandxss> setTimeout() { your code}, 0);
[04:21:13] <Foxandxss> just one tick
[04:21:19] <maqr> hmm
[04:21:28] <maqr> can i do it synchronously?
[04:21:55] <Foxandxss> yourFunction() { setTimeout(function() { code }, 0);}
[04:22:06] <Foxandxss> well, I do it for a sync operation
[04:22:11] <Foxandxss> use it*
[04:22:14] <Foxandxss> try :P
[04:22:20] <maqr> heh, yeah, trying it now
[04:22:27] <maqr> i forgot about that trick
[04:26:00] <maqr> damn, a tick won't work
[04:26:11] <maqr> i might need to find a new modal library :(
[04:32:59] <mkoell> I just want scroll to a specific element in the DOM by a selector. Do I need a plugin for this or does jquery offer this feature in its core?
[04:35:07] <Foxandxss> using link#tag doesnt work? :P
[04:36:02] <mkoell> link#tag? may work, but is the scrolling effect "smooth" enough or does it just skip to the tag?
[04:36:20] <Foxandxss> I guess it just skip :P
[04:36:42] <maqr> there's a scrollTo plugin that's pretty neat
[04:37:38] <mkoell> should be as lightweight as possible. thanks
[04:43:35] <devians> does anyone know a good alternative to scrollable from jquery tools? its exactly what i want except you cant prepend to the list :|
[04:59:04] <dabear> I just hate it when people leave
[05:01:36] <Acorn> Is there something special about textareas that stops key presses from bubbling out of them?
[05:02:47] <dub54> hi - can anyone see why autocomplete isn't showing any results on this http://109.123.110.189/vouchers/ - it's the demo copied from the autocomplete page, i've changed the data source to my own and the json is there in dev tools
[05:03:06] <dub54> (no dropdown shows)
[05:04:45] <coldhead> dabear: you have to leave a message for them with bot-t telling them what cunts they are
[05:07:57] <dabear> ?tell mkoell how nice of you to ask a question in this channel and then leave right away. I used some time to create this example for you :( http://jsfiddle.net/9ELVp/2/

[05:44:15] <vinadelmar> Hi everyone, I would like to hear your opinions on this: I'm building a web application. I would like to use the HTTP error codes instead of returning something like a json containing a success/error boolean. Example, I manually return a 400 Bad Request when there is a missing parameter. or a 404 Not Found when I can't get a row in a database. Am I "allowed" to tamper with the HTTP codes ? Is it bad or good practice ? Thanks
[05:44:44] <VictorCL2> hi :)  .. maybe someone would help me with a php problem .. since #php is a invite only channel  .... look at my problem ----> http://pastebin.com/qfGS25ZE
[05:46:42] <chjj> #php is invite-only? ...what are they protecting exactly?
[05:47:34] <vinadelmar> it's ##php i think
[05:49:10] <chjj> VictorCL2: whats your problem?
[05:49:21] <vinadelmar> btw VictorCL i don't see what's your problem here
[05:49:30] <vinadelmar> you're getting a dump of an array

[05:59:28] <motaka2> no one is there ?
[05:59:33] <dabear> motaka2: doesn't work in chrome either
[06:00:00] <motaka2> dabear: Do u have any idea?
[06:01:42] <dabear> I just see that http://parsbazkhord.com/portal/web/images/system/interface/ajax-loader.gif in every browser
[06:01:50] <dabear> including firefox
[06:03:35] <dabear> this will take way too loooong to debug
[06:03:36] <dabear> ?reduce @ motaka2
[06:03:37] <bot-t> motaka2, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.
[06:04:51] <motaka2> dabear: the problem accures after this line:  in about 123 years = data.years;
[06:05:02] <dabear> ?reduce @ motaka2
[06:05:02] <bot-t> motaka2, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.
[06:05:17] <dabear> the less code, the better
[06:05:32] <dabear> remove anything not related to the problem
[06:05:45] <motaka2> since it is ajax call I cant reduce it to simpler one
[06:06:10] <dabear> you can remove any other js code
[06:06:13] <dabear> and html
[06:06:15] <dabear> and css
[06:06:17] <dabear> so yes
[06:06:18] <dabear> you can
[06:06:23] <motaka2> dabear: it is from line 120 to 130

[06:12:52] <dabear> wait I might have set the brakepoint too early
[06:13:01] <motaka2> dabear:  look for this in js file:  $("#egy-info-field").change
[06:13:10] <b0c1> miapocs
[06:13:36] <dabear> data.years do exist
[06:13:48] <dabear> but it's an empty array
[06:13:56] <b0c1> dabear: in your screenshot it´s undefined
[06:14:17] <dabear> b0c1: yep, as I said, I set the brakepoint too early
[06:14:25] <dabear> so data is the old data
[06:14:27] <b0c1> :)
[06:14:39] <b0c1> ok, show the ¨new¨ data ss
[06:15:12] <dabear> fix your carset dude:p
[06:15:23] <dabear> charset*
[06:17:15] <fotoflo> Hey all, i am playing with JQuery-UI, and the documentation often says something like:   "Draggable elements gets a class of  ui-draggable"
[06:17:16] <motaka2> dabear: I have to fix my charset ?
[06:17:36] <devians> hey guys, i'm trying to load an image offscreen and slide it onscreen. i've messed about with heaps of ways with loading the image offscreen and then modifying the left property with .animate but i cant seem to get a good result. (it pops onscreen, or it comes out double the animation amount for some reason). any suggestions how i should do it?
[06:17:41] <dabear> no, b0c1 should
[06:17:57] <b0c1> mimimi?
[06:18:00] <fotoflo> does this mean i should give them that class, or that they get this class automatically when i run $(element).draggable()?
[06:20:32] <motaka2> dabear:  so why the data is not empty in firefox?
[06:20:53] <dabear> motaka2: when you do $("div#years").append(yearsCheckBoxStr); yearsCheckBoxStr is "<input type="button" id="draw-btn" name="draw" value="ØªØ±Ø³ÛŒÙ…"/>"
[06:21:12] <motaka2> dabear: yeah
[06:23:01] <dabear> motaka2: so it's the draw(); function that's problematic?
[06:23:23] <dabear> you said line 121, whichi s before the draw button is even created
[06:24:19] <motaka2> dabear: no, please look for success of this function $("#egy-info-field").change
[06:24:58] <dabear> yeah
[06:25:09] <dabear> and that success function is on line 121
[06:25:21] <dabear> where you have that console log
[06:25:31] <dabear> FIX YOUR MIND
[06:26:17] <motaka2> dabear: I removed the console.log
[06:26:57] <motaka2> dabear: lemme upload something elese for you
[06:27:20] <dabear> the problem isn't the console.log call
[06:27:40] <dabear> the problem is you don't know what you want help with, or you aren't telling at least
[06:27:53] <dabear> that's why I asked you to reduce the problem in the first place
[06:27:57] <dabear> ?reduce @ motaka2
[06:27:57] <bot-t> motaka2, Try reducing your code to the simplest example that still breaks, and *then* show it to us. Often you'll discover the answer in the process.
[06:28:06] <dabear> simplest example that still breaks
[06:28:09] <dabear> note that
[06:28:13] <dabear> and go do it
[06:28:16] <dabear> NOAW
[06:30:27] <motaka2> dabear: wait ...
[06:36:10] <natdivad> how can i know what other elements are available in the jquery ui autocomplete , currently i know that there are ui.item.id and ui.item.label but how do i get other "returned fields from a database"?
[06:42:19] <motaka2> dabear: there was a problem , would you please refresh the page and select the third option and then select one option and see the difference in IE and Firefox?
[06:44:24] <xover> In an event handler triggered by '$("#firstSibling").next().click()', shouldn't event.target be the next sibling relative to the element with ID #firstSibling rather than #firstSibling itself?
[06:46:22] <motaka2> dabear: I don't know what the problem is with IE on line 122 , I don't know whats wrrong with that line
[06:49:12] <motaka2> can any one help me figure out why this doesnt work in IE? http://parsbazkhord.com/portal/Egy/Units/Shls/Graphs/EgyInfoGraphByShlId/108 first select the third option from the first select box and then , from the apearing select box select something and the you will see the ajax image rotates for ever in IE but not in Firefox
[06:50:21] <motaka2> help me
[06:53:03] <fotoflo> Hey all, i am playing with JQuery-UI, and the documentation often says something like:  "Draggable elements gets a class of  ui-draggable", does this mean i should give them that class, or that they get this class automatically when i run $(element).draggable()?
[06:54:39] <motaka2> 	can any one help me figure out why this doesnt work in IE? http://parsbazkhord.com/portal/Egy/Units/Shls/Graphs/EgyInfoGraphByShlId/108 first select the third option from the first select box and then , from the apearing select box select something and the you will see the ajax image rotates for ever in IE but not in Firefox
[06:56:15] <xover> fotoflo: It means the elements get that class automatically, so that you can write a sylesheet that applies formatting to them or use the ThemeBuilder / CSS Framework.
[06:58:31] <fotoflo> xover: so i simply run $element.draggable() if i want to make it draggable
[06:58:37] <fotoflo> sorry
[06:58:44] <xover> yup
[06:58:47] <fotoflo> $(selector).draggable()
[07:00:48] <Acorn> Is there a way to get the current cursor position without reading from an event?
[07:04:47] <fotoflo> thakns
[07:05:02] <xover> Acorn: Not that I can think of off the top of my head, but have a look at <http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Mouse_Position> and see if you find a way to solve your problem.
[07:06:09] <Acorn> xover: seems like I'm just going to have to store the mouse position in a variable and update on mousemove
[07:06:43] <xover> That might be a bit heavy, performance wise: you'd be doing two variable assignments every single time the mouse moves.
[07:09:37] <xover> Hmm. I must really not be getting how .trigger() works.
[07:12:14] <xover> '$("#firstSibling").next().addClass("secondSibling"); $(".secondSibling").click();' also appears to trigger the event with event.target set to the element with ID #firstSibling.
[07:14:21] <xover> Hmm. Maybe it's a scoping issue with where I .bind() the handler and which event object I'm getting?
[07:20:37] <motaka2> 	can any one help me figure out why this doesnt work in IE? http://parsbazkhord.com/portal/Egy/Units/Shls/Graphs/EgyInfoGraphByShlId/108 first select the third option from the first select box and then , from the apearing select box select something and the you will see the ajax image rotates for ever in IE but not in Firefox
[07:24:01] <motaka2> no one can help me?
[07:31:02] <Spadeski> motaka2 What ya need?
[07:31:40] <motaka2> Spadeski: nothing I have it solved, IE is a really stupid browser
[07:32:03] <motaka2> Spadeski: I have my problem solved
[07:32:56] <Spadeski> alright
[07:37:45] <xover> Argh! Yes, it was a scoping issue; I was getting a stale event object.
[07:38:08] <xover> That's four hours down the drain due to my own stupidity. :-(
[07:39:22] <ravigehlot> I am using show(). Here is the problem. slideDown slides beneath a picture. How do I make it slide over the picture. It's a drop down menu.
[07:44:04] <Spadeski> How do i create audio in jquery? ?
[07:45:13] <xover> Spadeski: As far as I know, jQuery has no functionality specifically for dealing with audio.
[07:45:28] <Spadeski> hmm dang
[07:48:26] <xover> ravigehlot: Element depth ordering is determined by z-index, so the UI effect is probably inheriting the z-index of the drop down which is behind the image's z-index.
[07:49:36] <ravigehlot> xover: let me look into that
[07:50:54] <ravigehlot> xover: BINGO! Thanks
[08:06:46] <GreyTrilby> anyone about this afternoon?

[08:11:23] <gr3yh> i just need the option value iin my select box

[08:12:23] <gr3yh> I'm using jquery for error traping
[08:12:25] <gr3yh> trapping
[08:12:30] <GreyTrilby> e.g. load("booking.php?id=<?php echo $myID", "#roomid")
[08:13:17] <GreyTrilby> load() uses get by default anyway I think
[08:13:37] <GreyTrilby> oops - type in my code, forgot to close the php echo statement :)
[08:13:57] <Spadeski> :o
[08:14:02] <GreyTrilby> and then a typo in my typo correction
[08:14:07] * GreyTrilby slaps forehead
[08:14:13] <gr3yh> btw here is my php http://pastebin.com/WUWEvPk9
[08:14:14] <GreyTrilby> hey spad
[08:14:24] <Spadeski> sup grey
[08:14:35] <Spadeski> hows the day for ya
[08:15:28] <GreyTrilby> not bad - making some good progress on a project, but I'm caught in a loop :(
[08:15:56] <GreyTrilby> gr3y - first thing to check, you're passing $roomid to the script, right?
[08:16:12] <GreyTrilby> you define $roomid on line 88
[08:16:28] <GreyTrilby> in your script, try to just alert() that ID, make sure your script is receiving t properly
[08:16:41] <gr3yh> yes
[08:16:44] <GreyTrilby> i've just had a similar problem - just had to move my script to the correct part of my php scripting
[08:16:49] <gr3yh> oh
[08:16:52] <gr3yh> moving only
[08:16:53] <gr3yh> isee
[08:17:35] <GreyTrilby> all those if statments, it's easy to get lost, and then by the time you hit the body of your document you find that it doesn't work because (in some way or other) you've not arrived at that part of the if statement
[08:18:05] <gr3yh> ok ok
[08:18:11] <gr3yh> got it thnaks
[08:18:18] <gr3yh> will test it out and report back
[08:18:47] <GreyTrilby> @spad - very weird - i've got a function which calls a page. Run it on a jquery(click), it does it. Great. CLick it again it does it twice. Click it again, it does it 3 times. Driving me mad, can't work out why!
[08:20:38] <gr3yh> I got Error: invalid regular expression flag b
[08:21:05] <GreyTrilby> hmm - your php is a mite above my level to be honest
[08:21:43] <GreyTrilby> based on the code you used before, if you do alert("<?php echo $roomid;?>") does it correctly alert the room ID?
[08:21:56] <gr3yh> ill try
[08:22:50] <gr3yh> blank value
[08:23:02] <gr3yh> put the $roomid at the top of js function
[08:23:28] <gr3yh> if I put it on at the top of $reqFields
[08:23:36] <gr3yh> its give me error invlalid regular expression
[08:24:55] <GreyTrilby> are you correctly closing your php tags?
[08:25:01] <GreyTrilby> you'd need to do something like:
[08:25:31] <gr3yh> yep
[08:25:44] <GreyTrilby> echo '<script type="text/javascript">alert("'.$roomid.'")';
[08:27:57] <GreyTrilby> ah, just seen that you're doing all this php in a script anyway!
[08:28:04] <gr3yh> yes
[08:28:05] <gr3yh> xD
[08:28:16] <gr3yh> it will not work?
[08:28:33] <GreyTrilby> what line in your paste are you trying to add the alert to?
[08:28:39] <GreyTrilby> show me the new code
[08:29:05] <gr3yh> ok
[08:29:39] <Nacho_> How do I do onchange="show(this)" with jquery .change?
[08:30:01] <GreyTrilby> ? change
[08:30:01] <bot-t> .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[08:30:27] <Nacho_> I've read that...can't figure out how to pass the this
[08:30:49] <gr3yh> here
[08:30:50] <gr3yh> http://pastebin.com/x9f29k7q
[08:30:55] <gr3yh> putted comments
[08:30:57] <gr3yh> on them
[08:31:01] <GreyTrilby> 'k
[08:31:04] <GreyTrilby> gimme a sec
[08:31:13] <GreyTrilby> @Nacho - what're you trying to change
[08:32:26] <gr3yh> another updated comment
[08:32:26] <gr3yh> http://pastebin.com/EjQHSUXb
[08:32:40] <Nacho_> <select onchange="show(this)"> | I am trying to do that with jquery. $("select").change(?????? v v
[08:32:55] <Nacho_> GreyTrilby: That was for you. Sorry.
[08:33:39] <GreyTrilby> Nacho - but what is $(this)?
[08:34:04] <GreyTrilby> @Nacho add a class to your select
[08:34:26] <GreyTrilby> <select class="select">
[08:34:59] <GreyTrilby> then jquery - $(".myselect").change(function(){$(this).val()})
[08:35:02] <GreyTrilby> or something like that
[08:35:18] <GreyTrilby> first make sure you're selecting
[08:35:23] <GreyTrilby> then makes sure values are passing
[08:35:32] <GreyTrilby> then do something with the values
[08:35:35] <GreyTrilby> one step at a time :)
[08:35:48] <GreyTrilby> @gre3y - I'm a bit stumped!
[08:35:56] <GreyTrilby> What's this part of the form supposed to be doing?
[08:36:01] <Nacho_> GreyTrilby: I do. What I pasted here was just bare minimum. Im trying to use jquery to assign an onchange that calls a function that has a param which is reference to the select
[08:36:07] <GreyTrilby> (as I say, I'm more of a load-er than a get-er!
[08:36:16] <gr3yh> xD
[08:36:32] <gr3yh> it accepts booking form
[08:36:38] <gr3yh> like rooms
[08:36:40] <gr3yh> dates
[08:36:45] <gr3yh> comments
[08:36:55] <gr3yh> # of adults and children
[08:36:56] <GreyTrilby> @nacho - and it puts something from the value in a box elsewhere on the page (or some such)
[08:37:09] <GreyTrilby> so should this function take place when the document loads?
[08:37:09] <gr3yh> what I want is to check if the selected user room id does exist on database
[08:37:32] <gr3yh> if exists the form wont procced and with error
[08:38:13] <Nacho_> GreyTrilby: I wonder if this would work: .change(function(){show(this);});
[08:38:19] <GreyTrilby> ahh - sorry, I see, you're doing it in an onchange event!
[08:39:01] <gr3yh> yes
[08:39:03] <GreyTrilby> @Nacho - yeah, tht looks about right, but $(this) is a select - and you can't show a select in a select
[08:40:48] <GreyTrilby> @gr3yh - I'd comment out your current CheckR() function and re-write from scratch, making sure that you're receiving all the information before trying to do anything with it
[08:41:11] <GreyTrilby> and put stuff you're passing from php into variables
[08:42:23] <GreyTrilby> @gr3y - without seeing booking.php it's hard to say what you're receiving from it
[08:42:48] <gr3yh> thats the booking php btw
[08:43:07] <GreyTrilby> you're passing it back to itself?
[08:43:13] <GreyTrilby> fair enough
[08:43:31] <gr3yh> im passing it to thank-you.php
[08:43:37] <GreyTrilby> ah
[08:43:55] <gr3yh> this part only gets value and traps it
[08:43:59] <gr3yh> like a normal form
[08:44:07] <GreyTrilby> but it's not doing it?
[08:44:49] <GreyTrilby> if get() is falling over, I'd check that $get is receiving the right information
[08:45:28] <gr3yh> yeah
[08:45:34] <gr3yh> get receieves blank
[08:45:35] <gr3yh> value
[08:46:07] <gr3yh> tried putting checkPR
[08:46:09] <gr3yh> at the top
[08:46:14] <gr3yh> gives blank value
[08:46:20] <gr3yh> same as declaring PHP file
[08:46:49] <GreyTrilby> ok - so on performing the function, you're sending blank data
[08:48:11] <gr3yh> likely
[08:52:45] <GreyTrilby> ok - when you do the get call to booking.php do you have an if else statement to return an error if no ID is passed?
[08:53:14] <gr3yh> I don't have
[08:53:30] <gr3yh> but the options dont have blank value
[08:53:33] <gr3yh> its 100-250
[08:54:24] <gr3yh> it seems
[08:54:29] <gr3yh> the get value of jquery
[08:54:32] <gr3yh> gets all PHP Forms
[08:56:47] <GreyTrilby> no - the options don't, but you're doing a query based on them aren't you? what happens if (for some strange reason) that value doesn't get picked up by the query?
[08:57:29] <gr3yh> yes
[08:57:34] <gr3yh> nothing happens
[08:58:06] <GreyTrilby> AH HA!!
[08:58:18] <GreyTrilby> ok
[08:58:28] <GreyTrilby> the value you want to pass is the value of the option
[08:58:44] <gr3yh> yes
[08:58:48] <gr3yh> the for loop
[08:58:56] <gr3yh> but it didn't get me the value I want
[08:58:57] <GreyTrilby> what you're searching for $("#roomid") doesn't actually work
[08:59:04] <gr3yh> Sorry
[08:59:05] <gr3yh> >_<
[08:59:11] <gr3yh> what should be then?
[08:59:17] <GreyTrilby> there's no value being passed!
[08:59:23] <gr3yh> I got no idea on jquery
[08:59:26] <GreyTrilby> gimme a sec
[08:59:27] <gr3yh> more on PHP stuff
[08:59:30] <Woet> then read the docs, gr3yh
[08:59:34] <gr3yh> Ok ok thank you
[08:59:34] <Woet> or google
[08:59:41] <Woet> "jquery get the value of an input" for example
[08:59:41] <gr3yh> I was doing it
[08:59:49] <gr3yh> thats why I ended
[08:59:52] <gr3yh> doing get
[08:59:53] <gr3yh> xD
[08:59:57] <Woet> http://www.google.nl/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=jquery+get+the+value+of+an+input&hl=en
[08:59:59] <Woet> first result
[09:00:02] <gr3yh> which for some realson didn't work
[09:00:08] <Woet> lots of examples and extensive documentation
[09:04:44] <gr3yh> my bad
[09:04:53] <gr3yh> after I tried text() on jquery
[09:04:57] <gr3yh> google chrome crash
[09:06:00] <GreyTrilby> gr3y - try this: http://jsfiddle.net/ZZCj9/
[09:06:13] <GreyTrilby> remove the 'onchange' from your select
[09:07:04] <GreyTrilby> @gr3yh or leave it in and make this a function to call http://jsfiddle.net/ZZCj9/
[09:08:28] <gr3yh> let me check
[09:08:59] <GreyTrilby> @gr3yh - I *think* this will work with your onchange event http://jsfiddle.net/ZZCj9/1/
[09:09:15] <GreyTrilby> the first one I posted should definitely do it (E&OE)
[09:09:44] <austen> Mornin'
[09:10:09] <gr3yh> I'll just edit the checkR function right?
[09:10:42] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, is there any way to make aliases for jQuery methods?
[09:11:18] <GreyTrilby> yep - just change my comment line
[09:11:30] <GreyTrilby> check that the alert() works before anything else though!
[09:12:09] <austen> mbutbubuntu: var alias = $(selector).method [omit ()]
[09:12:28] <GreyTrilby> @woet - could you take a look at this fiddle and tell me why it keeps looping when i click 'update'? Click it once, it does it once, click it once more, it does it twice, click it once more it does it 3 times. Can't for the life of me figure out why... http://jsfiddle.net/X8jBF/
[09:12:29] <austen> or $.method [omit ()]
[09:12:41] <gr3yh> nothing happens
[09:12:43] <gr3yh> xD
[09:12:48] <austen> Then you just all alias({parameters})
[09:12:52] <GreyTrilby> show me the new code?
[09:13:02] <austen> s/all/call
[09:13:10] <GreyTrilby> (and which version of mine did you use?)
[09:14:03] <gr3yh> http://jsfiddle.net/CsxAB/
[09:15:45] <GreyTrilby> do you mean "roomid" or "roomidd"?
[09:16:23] <gr3yh> its just the same
[09:16:40] <GreyTrilby> you don't need to do the get function twice
[09:17:12] <gr3yh> I just change the roomidd
[09:17:21] <gr3yh> to check if im getting typo error
[09:18:41] <gr3yh> Error: missing : after property id
[09:18:48] <gr3yh> got that and CheckR not defined
[09:18:49] <GreyTrilby> you're missing a bracket
[09:18:50] <gr3yh> btw

[09:24:07] <GreyTrilby> @woet: done http://jsfiddle.net/X8jBF/1/
[09:25:42] <GreyTrilby> @gre3yh - I'm missing a . in $.get - that might be it :o
[09:26:10] <rocktop> hello why remove fieldset dosn't work with jquery on this example anyidea? http://pastebin.com/U2iE2C6B
[09:27:08] <gr3yh> still the same
[09:27:31] <gr3yh> it says on this part?

[09:28:31] <rocktop> anyidea?
[09:29:42] <GreyTrilby> @gr3yh - the problem is I'm a dick :)
[09:29:44] <GreyTrilby> one sexc
[09:29:45] <GreyTrilby> sec
[09:30:07] <gr3yh> lol >_< my bad dude for getting you a hard time on my stupid code
[09:30:55] <GreyTrilby> http://jsfiddle.net/CsxAB/2/
[09:31:22] <GreyTrilby> right number of brackets, just one in the wrong place
[09:32:14] <gr3yh> yeah and the .get
[09:32:29] <gr3yh> what jquery should i use
[09:32:43] <gr3yh> this one gives me error
[09:32:46] <gr3yh> ?
[09:32:46] <gr3yh> Error: elem.nodeName is undefined
[09:33:02] <GreyTrilby> hmm... can't help on that - your page mixes jquery and javascript
[09:33:06] <gr3yh> and this? i don't know if its included
[09:33:06] <gr3yh> Error: uncaught exception: TypeError: document.documentElement is null
[09:33:12] <gr3yh> oh
[09:33:16] <gr3yh> I see
[09:35:09] <gr3yh> working now
[09:35:15] <gr3yh> thanks
[09:35:20] <gr3yh> changed the jquery version to lower
[09:35:21] <gr3yh> lol
[09:35:21] <gr3yh> 1.43
[09:35:27] <gr3yh> 1.4.3
[09:36:35] <mbutubuntu> austen, thanks
[09:36:54] <gr3yh> Thank you GreyTrilby
[09:36:56] <gr3yh> xD
[09:37:10] <gr3yh> Can I assign the value that jquery get to a PHP variable?
[09:37:10] <GreyTrilby> no worries- glad it worked
[09:37:44] <GreyTrilby> to do what?
[09:37:46] <austen> No prob. :)
[09:38:28] <gr3yh> so I can check my db if the selected value is on the db
[09:38:41] <gr3yh> something like this
[09:38:43] <rocktop> !highlight
[09:38:44] <gr3yh> if($rch == $roomid AND $rch1 == '1')
[09:38:46] <GreyTrilby> you mean using some code in booking.php
[09:39:22] <gr3yh> yeah
[09:39:29] <GreyTrilby> you'd need to include a php function in the page and just pass it as a variable (which you're already doing) - at least in theory!
[09:40:01] <GreyTrilby> if(isset($_GET['roomid'])) { do function to check in the database}
[09:40:09] <gr3yh> yes yes I just need to validate it before sending it to my thank-you.php
[09:40:15] <gr3yh> Ok ok
[09:40:29] <gr3yh> I was thinking of declaring first
[09:40:43] <GreyTrilby> essentially that $.get() thing is the same as visting "room.php?roomid=myroomid"
[09:41:31] <GreyTrilby> so you can just say $roomidtocheck = $_GET['roomid'];
[09:42:29] <JuicePort> yo
[09:42:40] <JuicePort> mrmist: I made it through the wilderness. Somehow I made it through. Didn't know how lost I was, until I found Jquery!
[09:47:16] <JuicePort> mrmist: Reading, brb
[09:47:39] <gr3yh> Thanks GreyTrilby
[09:47:43] <gr3yh> Dude your my lifesaver
[09:47:52] <gr3yh> this Thesis Project is pain in the ass
[09:47:57] <GreyTrilby> not worries - happy to help :)
[09:48:11] <gr3yh> I'm just self studying everything
[09:48:11] <GreyTrilby> I think I need a drink now.
[09:48:23] <GreyTrilby> and a  solution to things happening 5 times when I click abutton once
[09:49:13] <gr3yh> Ok Ok :)
[09:53:44] <GreyTrilby> Can anyone advise why when clicking a button to submit a form, it does it 5 times? (if i've submitted the form 4 times before hand)
[09:54:30] <BarelyFitz> GreyTrilby: perhaps you added a .submit() handler multiple times?
[09:54:50] <GreyTrilby> nope - it's just there once
[09:54:59] <GreyTrilby> I've got two buttons (with different ids)
[09:55:00] <gr3yh> for loop Grey?
[09:55:05] <gr3yh> xD
[09:55:05] <GreyTrilby> both submit the form
[09:55:09] <BarelyFitz> sorry, gotta go
[09:55:19] <gr3yh> just giving suggestions
[09:55:23] <GreyTrilby> but depending on which button is pressed it either submits it to one place or another
[09:55:31] <GreyTrilby> (add or update - it's the same form for both)
[09:55:45] <gr3yh> uh
[09:55:47] <gr3yh> event?
[09:55:50] <gr3yh> with condition
[09:55:56] <gr3yh> am i right?
[09:55:59] <gr3yh> is it still jquery?
[09:56:25] <GreyTrilby> yep
[09:56:42] <GreyTrilby> http://jsfiddle.net/X8jBF/2/
[09:57:42] <gr3yh> my bad
[09:57:49] <gr3yh> I don't know much about jquery still learning
[09:57:58] <gr3yh> I thought that idea in PHP
[09:58:01] <gr3yh> xD
[09:59:34] <gr3yh> Btw Grey
[09:59:40] <gr3yh> does the function u make
[09:59:43] <gr3yh> only works on $_GET?
[09:59:51] <gr3yh> does it work on others? $_REQUEST?
[10:00:19] <razzi> are you talking to youself?
[10:00:34] <gr3yh> Uh Noh
[10:00:39] <gr3yh> there is another GreyTrilby
[10:00:47] <GreyTrilby> never used $_REQUEST
[10:00:50] <gr3yh> lol
[10:01:02] <yan__nick> Hey guys, how can I check whether an element is hovered?
[10:01:24] <ajpiano> GreyTrilby your javascript  code re binds a new submit event every time you run the updateMBM function
[10:01:49] <ajpiano> FYI.
[10:02:28] <razzi> yan_nic, .hover ?
[10:02:48] <ajpiano> yan__nick: you can't just check that at any given time an element "is hovered"
[10:02:56] <GreyTrilby> ajpiano - ahhh - thank you!
[10:03:03] <GreyTrilby> how do I fix that? *looks blank*
[10:03:05] <ajpiano> all you can do is track the mouse events and set a flag when the mouseenter happens and remove it when mouseleave happens
[10:03:35] <ajpiano> GreyTrilby: you apply critical thinking skills
[10:03:49] <GreyTrilby> you mean like "unbind?"
[10:03:49] <ajpiano> right now you are calling a function that binds a submit handler over and over again
[10:03:58] <ajpiano> no
[10:04:02] <GreyTrilby> oh
[10:04:04] <ajpiano> like, only bind it once to begin with
[10:04:25] <ajpiano> and then like, you can trigger the submit event with some data, like that add or update string
[10:04:27] <ajpiano> ?trigger
[10:04:27] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[10:04:45] <GreyTrilby> ooh - interesting
[10:04:48] <GreyTrilby> cheers - I'll take a look
[10:04:53] <ajpiano> kk
[10:04:58] <ajpiano> i'm going to get coffe, gl
[10:06:48] <yan__nick> ajpiano: i've two elements, a hidden element and a trigger. if you hover the trigger, the hidden element should be shown. if you leave the trigger, the hidden element should be set to hidden. but if you hover the hidden elemebnt, it has to be visible
[10:09:52] <gr3yh> btw Grey
[10:10:02] <gr3yh> I think I get blank value again
[10:10:16] <gr3yh> tried this
[10:10:17] <gr3yh> alert(" Data" + roomid + theRoomID)
[10:10:26] <gr3yh> gave me blank value and objectHTML Element
[10:10:40] <gr3yh> gave me blank value and objectHTMLSELECT Element
[10:10:43] <GreyTrilby> show me the code
[10:11:27] <GreyTrilby> @ajpiano - I'm confused, how does it submit a form without submitting a form?!
[10:11:29] <gr3yh> the one that you created
[10:11:31] <gr3yh> xD
[10:12:02] <gr3yh> http://jsfiddle.net/CsxAB/3/
[10:12:38] <GreyTrilby> roomid is the name of the data you're submitting, not the datatype itself. You want the VALUE which is theRoomID
[10:13:56] <gr3yh> Yeah but the it gave me objectHTMLSELECT Element
[10:13:56] <GreyTrilby> booking.php?roomid // - roomid is the data identifier. if, in php you tried to echo 'roomid' you'd get nothing, because it has no value assigned
[10:14:20] <GreyTrilby> booking.php?roomid=223 //echo $_GET['roomid'] will give you "223"
[10:14:49] <GreyTrilby> you haven't defined roomid
[10:15:04] <GreyTrilby> you are using roomid to define something else to your php script
[10:15:12] <gr3yh> I defined it at the bottom of the script
[10:15:19] <GreyTrilby> you could call it susan if you wanted, as long as your php script at the other end knows what to do with susan
[10:15:35] <austen> Is there a good resource somewhere that lists all of the event properties passed around inside jquery events? I'm sick of writing loops to parse event objects to find the data I need... Srsly, jquery should have that in the damn documentation...
[10:16:00] <GreyTrilby> gr3yh - no you didn't :)
[10:16:52] <gr3yh> I just want to get the value of the select selectbox xD
[10:17:24] <Jonz> austen, it's a (free) community project, feel free to suggest changes to the website in a civilized manner..
[10:18:02] <Jonz> also, what data exactly are you looking for that you're mucking around with the jquery internals to get to?
[10:20:56] <DerNalia> hey, having some problems with animation: http://pastie.org/2369307 Not sure how to get it so that my div slides off the screen THEN changes what is inside, then slides back on. Currently it slides off, and while it's doing so, you can see the contents changing. =\
[10:21:28] <austen> I'm binding a click event to an element, I want to return the position where I clicked in that element. The element is bigger than the window, so it is important that the position is relative to the element and not the window or such...
[10:21:46] <GreyTrilby> that value is "theRoomID"
[10:21:48] <ajpiano> austen, console.dir(event) ?
[10:21:54] <yan__nick> ajpiano: if you hover the blablabla it shouldn't go away http://jsfiddle.net/5szDz/
[10:22:01] <GreyTrilby> @gr3yh - that value is theRoomID
[10:23:07] <ajpiano> austen, you should be able to use the event.pageX and event.pageY, then get the element's .offset(), and subtract the offset values from the page x and y
[10:23:14] <ajpiano> and yo'ull get the coords of the click relative to the element
[10:26:45] <GreyTrilby> @ajpiano - sorry, i'm struggling to relate that documentation to what I want to do - code now looks like this http://jsfiddle.net/X8jBF/3/
[10:29:15] <ajpiano> yan__nick http://jsfiddle.net/5szDz/1/
[10:29:43] <ajpiano> GreyTrilby $(this) isn't magica
[10:30:02] <ajpiano> if you're clicking on the button, triggering submit on it will do precisely 0
[10:30:49] <ajpiano> the bottom line is that you should really be handleing your form submissions IN the form submit event, not on click events on the buttons that submit it
[10:30:51] <ajpiano> gimme a min
[10:31:34] <GreyTrilby> @ajpiano - I would do that - and in fact until a couple of hours ago that's what I was doing - then I realised I needed to be able to submit the form to two different places
[10:31:39] <GreyTrilby> hence two buttons
[10:31:43] <ajpiano> right
[10:31:48] <yan__nick> ajpiano: and http://jsfiddle.net/5szDz/2/ ?
[10:31:54] <ajpiano> but that is where you slid off the handle
[10:32:06] <GreyTrilby> pray explain...
[10:32:08] <ajpiano> just because you have to submit the form in two places doesn't mean you have ot do it like this :)
[10:32:33] <GreyTrilby> I'm happy to consider alternatives - I just couldn't think of any that didn't involve reloading the entire page
[10:32:36] <ajpiano> yan__nick: if that works for you then have fun
[10:33:13] <GreyTrilby> plus I've never used trigger before
[10:33:25] <ajpiano> GreyTrilby: are you familiar with the concept of "give me a minute" :p
[10:33:42] <GreyTrilby> :P of course - sorry - figured you'd read on your return
[10:33:52] <GreyTrilby> was just getting what I wanted to say out of the way!
[10:39:17] <ajpiano> GreyTrilby, there are a lot of ways to skin this cat http://jsfiddle.net/X8jBF/7/
[10:39:30] <ajpiano> but what i did in this was just store the string you wanted in the input's name attribute
[10:39:46] <ajpiano> and store that type as a piece of data on the form
[10:40:03] <ajpiano> and then when the form submit happens, it reads that piece of data and goes accordingly
[10:41:04] <GreyTrilby> damn, that's some dark magic
[10:41:17] <ajpiano> it really isn't
[10:41:44] <GreyTrilby> it is if yo'ure me :)
[10:41:56] <GreyTrilby> and I@m guessin g I could replace  $(this).closest("form"). with the actual form ID?
[10:42:19] <GreyTrilby> i'd also just worked out what you meant with the trigger thing
[10:42:44] <GreyTrilby> i was just in the process of changing it when you messaged with your dark magic
[10:42:55] <GreyTrilby> couldn't get it to pass the 'type' though
[10:43:37] <GreyTrilby> @ajpiano - what I don't understand though is why it was rebinding every time - there's only one form, andonly one call to the function
[10:49:11] <ajpiano> GreyTrilby that is frightening
[10:49:17] <ajpiano> because um
[10:49:28] <ajpiano> $("#form").submit(function() { }); binds a new submit handler
[10:49:33] <ajpiano> and you had that code inside of a function
[10:49:40] <ajpiano> that you clearly were calling multiple times
[10:50:19] <GreyTrilby> *facepalm*
[10:50:26] <GreyTrilby> sometimes I can't see the wood for the trees
[10:50:46] <Shi> yop
[10:50:52] <GreyTrilby> annoyingly, my textarea functions seem to have stopped working now
[10:50:58] <GreyTrilby> but I think I can sort that out :)
[10:51:32] <Shi> how can construct a selector to get a class element from a variable
[10:52:04] <beakybal4> hi
[10:52:18] <Shi> like $parent.$('.addInput')
[10:52:51] <beakybal4> if i wanted to find out the contents of a sibling div with classname "question-number", how would i go about that?
[10:53:06] <ajpiano> Shi: uh
[10:53:11] <Shi> :/
[10:53:15] <ajpiano> a "class element?"
[10:53:45] <Shi> it's a span with that class
[10:54:00] <ajpiano> $parent.find(".whatever")
[10:54:16] <Shi> i'll try this
[10:54:33] <Shi> and read about .find()
[10:54:35] <Shi> $
[10:54:37] <Shi> thx
[10:54:45] <beakybal4> ajpiano: ill read the docs on that thanks
[10:55:07] <ajpiano> beakybal4 $(foo).siblings(".bar").html() or .text()
[10:55:57] <Shi> its working for me ajpiano thanks a lot
[10:55:57] <beakybal4> ajpiano: .bar being the sibiling i want to select?
[10:56:02] <ajpiano> yup
[10:56:07] <beakybal4> sweet thanks

[11:07:21] <beakybal4> :O
[11:08:30] <lexflex> hello everybody
[11:08:42] <diane> hey lex
[11:08:43] <lexflex> can anyone tell me some good blogs related to jQuery?
[11:10:55] <lexflex> nobody? diane?
[11:11:09] <diane> www.jquery4u.com
[11:11:11] <ajpiano> hm
[11:11:18] <beakybal4> ajpiano: hope you have a good day/night/evening!
[11:11:23] <beakybal4> ajpiano: ciao for now!
[11:11:29] <ajpiano> ciao
[11:11:32] <beakybal4> ajpiano: thanks muchly for your assistance!
[11:13:01] <ajpiano> lexflex, what about podcasts ;)
[11:13:33] <lexflex> hey ajpiano
[11:14:13] <lexflex> yea well, thats another way, but i just bought a Nook so i am very excited about converting RSS feeds into epubs and read them on the reader
[11:14:21] <ajpiano> ah
[11:14:28] <ajpiano> well in that case... i don't have a good jquery one
[11:14:38] <lexflex> do you have a good podcast?
[11:14:40] <GreyTrilby> yes - thanks for your help @ajpiano - much appreciated
[11:14:41] <ajpiano> but paul_irish has a killer bucket of like awesome front-end related rss feeds
[11:14:45] <ajpiano> lexflex: http://yayquery.com
[11:14:53] <multipass|2> with the jquery validate plugin, how do i make a input file required?
[11:15:28] <ajpiano> lexflex: http://paulirish.com/2010/front-end-development-feeds-to-follow/
[11:15:34] <GreyTrilby> why can I not clear the value of a textarea once it's been edited? any taker? Code works fine if I don't edit the value, but as soon as I do, it stops working
[11:16:04] <ajpiano> how are you trying to clear it
[11:17:07] <idefine> when uploading a form with files, it is possible to determine the size of each of the files being uploaded on the server side, it's possible to get bytes received and bytes expected for the entire form, but is it possible to get it for each file filed?
[11:18:12] <lexflex> ajpiano: brilliant! thank you
[11:19:14] <GreyTrilby> $("#myid").text("");
[11:19:25] <ajpiano> GreyTrilby use .val("")
[11:19:26] <GreyTrilby> i've also tried with .html("") but that didn't work either
[11:19:42] <GreyTrilby> @ajpiano - that didn't work either

[11:19:48] <ajpiano> :D
[11:22:10] <GreyTrilby> @ajpiano - damn freaky thing :)
[11:22:38] <GreyTrilby> if I used val() it stopped it having any value at all (even when I was telling it to have one)
[11:22:38] <diane> how would i script a toggle that toggles a li based on the value of a <p>? Something like all <p>girls</p> would hide via toggle?
[11:22:44] <ajpiano> GreyTrilby:  http://jsfiddle.net/2bzva/
[11:22:48] <GreyTrilby> but now fixed it - thanks again @ajp
[11:23:36] <GreyTrilby> food time! cheers all
[11:23:48] <ajpiano> diane: if ($("p").text()=== "girls") { } etc.
[11:24:42] <GreyTrilby> @ajpiano - if you're ever in my neck of the woods, tell me to buy you a beer!

[11:47:45] <symaxian> What is the x argument on the easing functions, the first argument
[11:50:58] <grid_> did anyone ever see John Resig on this channel?
[11:51:25] <ajpiano> he's talked here on occasion
[11:53:48] <jaypitidi> I am trying to call a php function from jquery. my php script generates a random value with shuffle($random); and that value is echoed to the browser. my ajax script will load a page with those random values. I would like those values to continue to randomize with every click() method. How can I do this?
[11:54:37] <timemachine3030> ajpiano, it was bad json .. right on .. unquoted keys .. I'm working with someone else's feed that is originally intended to run with jquery 1.2, back when jquery did the new Functions("json") messiness.
[11:54:59] <grid_> ajpiano: ah nice, just wanted to know, does anyone know him irl from this channel? atleast someone who is here in general not to much idle
[11:55:06] <ajpiano> grid_: me
[11:55:28] <ajpiano> amongst others :)
[11:56:18] <grid_> nice!
[11:56:52] <ajpiano> i once met muhammad ali outside of a hotel
[11:57:30] <xover> ajpiano: This <http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide22> should probably be mentioned on <http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Developer_Guide>.
[11:57:56] <xover> Along with related issues such as file naming guidelines for plugins.
[11:58:05] <modestKdr> how to show an image on li:hover when the image is in a seperate div
[11:58:08] <ajpiano> we're in the midst of reworking that doc but yeah, duly noted.
[11:58:39] <grid_> i could see bill clinton 2 months ago, close from where i am :) i didn't see him, i wouldn't need to see him

[12:04:22] <paul_irish> im kinda into this. https://github.com/deadlyicon/s.js  its like scss selectors within jquery
[12:20:06] <mib_mib> hi guys, i want to use this plugin: https://github.com/house9/jquery-iframe-auto-height - how do i make it so that if i dynamically add in an iframe, that this automatically resizes it to the proper height?
[12:21:02] <paul_irish> livequery mebbe?
[12:22:24] <mib_mib> .live() u mean?
[12:24:02] <Sevey> hey guys i had a question - i want to create a web based form where a customer can enter there ID and then hit submit and a text feild will update a pre determained feild with their infromation
[12:24:08] <Sevey> any ideas?
[12:25:31] <amh345> i have an list of items displayed on a page. i have a modal popping up right now with data for each item.   only thing is im not sure how to position the popup beside the link that was clicked.   position is currently set to show at the top left corner every time.  is there a way to get it to show beside the clicked item?  thank you
[12:26:01] <aaairc> would people here recommend history.js?
[12:27:06] <mib_mib> amh345: .offset() maybe or .position() ?
[12:27:20] <mib_mib> Sevey: that seems easy.
[12:28:05] <Sevey> i havent touched much Jquery so if you wouldnt mind pointing me in a direction id be obliged
[12:28:40] <amh345> mib_mib: yeah. i did it before with some canned code. im just trying to figure out what to do on my own this time around.
[12:29:18] <mib_mib> amh345: so try starting with those methods.
[12:29:48] <amh345> mib_mib: ok. will do.  im sure i need the curent position of this or soemthing, no?
[12:31:36] <mib_mib> Sevey: well.... you would probably want to use a .val() to get the value of the text box, then use .ajax() method to do the request, probably return the data as json from the server, and then on the .ajax callback method, you would set the value of say a textbox by using .val again... here is the first google result i found http://www.sitepoint.com/ajax-jquery/
[12:31:52] <mib_mib> Sevey: i'm sure you can find more.
[12:32:03] <mib_mib> amh345: did you check out the position method?
[12:32:06] <amh345> i have another question. a client has an absurd request that will no doubt make this site look terrible.   first i have to use a custom font (this is working). but the other issue is that this custom font is HUGE and makes the text go off the page or stretch it's container.   so, they want me to scale the font to a smaller size if it is too large (if x=y).  is there anything in jquery to ahcieve this?
[12:32:15] <amh345> mib_mib: im looking at that stuff now
[12:32:57] <VictorCl2> how can I get the last visible item on a list ?
[12:33:11] <Sevey> mib - thank you im looking around
[12:33:14] <mib_mib> amh345: how about just setting the font-size smaller
[12:33:39] <mib_mib> amh345: but there also is a 'zoom' setting that workx in everything except firefox, but there is a workaround...probably not what you want though.
[12:33:50] <amh345> mib_mib: heh. i proposed that idea.   it *would* make the most sense.  but they want it full size unless too large.  i've fought them on this 3 times and im not winning
[12:34:08] <mib_mib> amh345: no, what i mean is make the font-size smaller if its too big
[12:34:15] <amh345> oh
[12:34:26] <amh345> ok. yeah. dynamically?  that's kind of what im looking for
[12:34:51] <amh345> is there a lib for that?  or a name i can google?
[12:35:15] <mib_mib> amh345: not sure
[12:35:50] <amh345> ok. it's low on my priority list.  right now im going to work on that position stuff.  thanks
[12:36:44] <mib_mib> amh345: off the top of my head, there are auto-grow text box plugins, so they must be able to determine the right width of text that is long. using that, you could determine the width of the text on a line, and then if its over a certain number, scale it accordingly.... just a guess really
[12:37:12] <amh345> perfect. thank you
[12:37:16] <mib_mib> some googling probably will find something
[12:55:02] <Gates_> hi
[12:55:14] <Gates_> <script>$(document).ready(function(){ $('#real_totpage_51').replaceWith(function(){ return 117; });</script>
[12:55:19] <Gates_> i must be making a simple mistake
[12:57:34] <Gates_> prob stupid comex
[12:57:35] <Gates_> complex
[12:57:35] <Gates_> $(document).ready(function(){ $('#real_totpage_51').text('117'); });

[13:20:09] <sylow> Hi, I'm using jquery to retrieve an ajax result, then update some div with html
[13:21:01] <sylow> everything works OK if I just use some text, but my html list doens't get to the output.. when I encode the result with htmlentities() (php), it works, but of course not the encoding I need
[13:21:17] <sylow> how can I decode those chars again in the jquery response?
[13:21:37] <sylow> or does anyone has suggestions to workaround this
[13:21:53] <sylow> it's json_encode'ed, by the way
[13:52:08] <min|dvir|us> I'm having a tough time figuring out why the navigation links aren't changing colors at the right place. http://min.dvir.us/.
[13:52:48] <min|dvir|us> bio changes too late; resume changes too late; contact changes too early.
[13:53:50] <min|dvir|us> No, resume changes too early. My bad.
[13:54:49] <min|dvir|us> Any advice would be highly appreciated.
[13:58:36] <BaconJuice_> hey
[13:58:38] <BaconJuice_> anyone here?
[13:58:48] <min|dvir|us> No. Go away.
[13:59:02] <lampe> hey i wanne load a page with params or with a rout like example.com/mypage is there a way to do this in jquery?
[13:59:33] <min|dvir|us> lampe: $.ajax().
[14:00:59] <lampe> okay i will look into it min|dvir|us
[14:01:03] <lampe> thx
[14:06:15] <sylow> hmm, I have a div that is filled with a jquery result, but when I click on a link of that output in the browser, it doesn't work anymore
[14:06:46] <sylow> when I view the source of the file, of course I only see the <div id="foo"></div>, is this normal?
[14:07:19] <sylow> (that the next click is't executed, I mean)
[14:07:47] <sylow> its handler looks for an 'a' tag , which isn't actually in the HTML output
[14:08:13] <systemfault> What^
[14:08:32] <sylow> probably my question is a bit vague, sorry
[14:08:48] <systemfault> View source is the html the page loaded
[14:08:52] <systemfault> Not the current state.
[14:09:03] <sylow> i'm having all this mess because I just wanted to update several divs in 1 request
[14:09:37] <sylow> yeah systemfault so it looks that my handler for the a tag doesn't work because it isn't actually html, correct?
[14:09:56] <systemfault> I don't really understand, you're being a bit vague :/
[14:10:06] <sylow> sorry, I'm loosing it a bit ;)
[14:10:40] <sylow> this is my setup, I have a list of words, when I click a word, it gets added to some tag-list
[14:11:22] <grantg> The population count in here is too damn high!
[14:11:35] <sylow> after when I click a word, the div of all the words gets updated again, but it's generated by the jquery / ajax result
[14:11:50] <sylow> I see it in the browser correctly, but functionality is gone
[14:12:02] <sylow> is that behaviour correct?
[14:12:48] <sylow> I better used .load() I guess , would save me so much trouble
[14:14:20] <jaypitidi> I'm having trouble writing a function to append an anchor if a <li> element is empty
[14:17:12] <min|dvir|us> Try scrolling http://min.dvir.us/ and watching the nav links. Any thoughts?
[14:17:32] <sylow> systemfault: could you explain what jquery looks to? is it the state or the generated html ?
[14:18:14] <systemfault> sylow: The browser loads the .html file and inside, it creates a tree of nodes... after, the browser doesn't touch the .html file.
[14:18:26] <systemfault> We call that, the DOM tree
[14:18:42] <systemfault> You can use a debugger (like you should be doing) to inspect it.
[14:19:08] <systemfault> The "Chrome dev tools" for chrome or Firebug if you use Firefox
[14:19:10] <sylow> I do, I have firebug, there I see the HTML I expect, (the jquery's output that is)
[14:19:24] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: You're a genius... think you can advise?
[14:20:07] <systemfault> Advise what?
[14:20:13] <sylow> systemfault: but when I ctrl+u to view the source, I only see the <div id="foo"></div> .. And the html that's inside that doesn't seem to listen to Jquery anymore
[14:20:19] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: Nav links change colors at the wrong time.
[14:20:31] <min|dvir|us> sylow: Sounds like a syntax error.
[14:21:01] <systemfault> sylow: Forget ctrl+u
[14:21:32] <systemfault> sylow: Open firebug and check the DOM tab
[14:22:12] <systemfault> min|dvir|us: Not sure I get the problem, they look fine :/
[14:22:18] <sylow> systemfault: ok what do I have to look for there?
[14:22:25] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: See when they change blue?
[14:22:41] <min|dvir|us> Bio changes too late, and resume and contact change too early.
[14:26:44] <min|dvir|us> systemfault: Sorry. Did I miss anything?
[14:26:56] <systemfault> Not that I can easily see.
[14:27:19] <min|dvir|us> If I explain what I'm doing, do you think you'd be more apt to lend your expertise?
[14:35:48] <anli_> Can I set the position with .position({left:3, top:4}); ?
[14:36:01] <anli_> I tried, but it seems to be 0
[14:36:08] <dianeinflorida> If i am creating a list dynamically from an xml file in jquery mobile  and the li has no content how can I disable the display of the empty li
[14:36:22] <jaypitidi> what is wrong with this code? http://pastebin.com/5um1piaR
[14:36:53] <anli_> jaypitidi: I see no http:
[14:37:00] <anli_> Should it be a valid link anyway?
[14:37:07] <jaypitidi> that is valid
[14:37:22] <jaypitidi> all the links on my site are in that format
[14:37:29] <sylow> what strategy would you use to update multiple divs with one ajax request ? json didn't work out for me
[14:37:46] <jaypitidi> but my problem is it is not appending the anchor if the li is empty
[14:37:56] <razzi> jayne you are appending to something that does not exist
[14:38:07] <razzi> jaypitidi*
[14:38:15] <anli_> ah
[14:38:22] <jaypitidi> the list elements do exist
[14:38:43] <anli_> But the if statement does not say there is  no li element
[14:38:57] <razzi> oh yeah, sorry
[14:39:24] <min|dvir|us> Hey everyone. Try scrolling http://min.dvir.us/ and watching the nav links change colors at the wrong time. Any thoughts?
[14:39:26] <jaypitidi> I am saying if the li element is empty then append an anchor
[14:39:46] <anli_> Do you only have one li on the list?
[14:39:49] <anli_> in
[14:39:54] <jaypitidi> meaning if ithe li element has no children
[14:40:02] <jaypitidi> no I have 5
[14:40:04] <anli_> aha
[14:40:12] <anli_> And you want to do this for each of them?
[14:40:41] <jaypitidi> yes, but i don't even see it doing it for one of them
[14:40:52] <anli_> $('ul.p1 li').each(message_if_empty);
[14:41:08] <anli_> then in function message_if_empty, $(this) is the li element in question
[14:41:12] <anli_> A function you write
[14:41:21] <anli_> var li = $(this);
[14:41:23] <anli_> In other words
[14:41:49] <simonleojung> min|dvir|us: i told you that you're not accounting for your header already
[14:41:51] <anli_> If (li.children() == 0) li.append('foo');
[14:41:59] <anli_> oops, not If, but if
[14:42:00] <simonleojung> remove the 60px height  on the head
[14:42:06] <simonleojung> and it works fine
[14:42:19] <min|dvir|us> simonleojung: 60px height on what?
[14:42:27] <simonleojung> header
[14:42:35] <simonleojung> to be exact #header
[14:42:41] <min|dvir|us> simonleojung: From where?
[14:42:57] <simonleojung> your css
[14:43:12] <min|dvir|us> simonleojung: ...?
[14:43:20] <min|dvir|us> No.
[14:43:34] <min|dvir|us> That's not the problem, at least.
[14:43:51] <simonleojung> well works fine for me without the height: 60px
[14:43:59] <min|dvir|us> I'll try it.
[14:44:11] <simonleojung> the blue changes exactly as it passes the bio, resume, etc
[14:45:18] <min|dvir|us> simonleojung: Exactly? Not on my screen.
[14:45:31] <min|dvir|us> Closer, yes.
[14:45:46] <simonleojung> hm.. let me try again
[14:45:52] <min|dvir|us> Bio still too late, resume and contact too early.
[14:47:00] <min|dvir|us> simonleojung: The point is that when a user clicks on bio, it should select bio.
[14:47:52] <gustavobrasil> hi
[14:48:25] <gustavobrasil> $.ajax dont process error 403
[14:48:30] <gustavobrasil> in localhost
[14:48:35] <gustavobrasil> in serve its work?
[14:50:03] <simonleojung> ah i get it
[14:50:09] <simonleojung> let me fool around
[14:50:20] <min|dvir|us> Go for it! :)
[14:58:22] <jaypitidi> anli : that didn't work http://jsfiddle.net/jrqxW/   how come this isn't appending any links?
[14:58:52] <min|dvir|us> simonleojung: Any thoughts?
[14:59:55] <simonleojung> min|dvir|us: not yet, playing around with it in a fiddle
[15:00:20] <min|dvir|us> simonleojung: You da best. :)
[15:17:20] <Nacho_> Is there an easy way to got all children of an element, clone it x times, search and replace a string in each clone and append to another element?
[15:18:47] <VictorCl2> anyone knows a plugin that would do someothing like this http://demos.webdevkit.net/uBillboard/#   but with only 1 image?
[15:18:47] <nny> $("div").append("text");?
[15:18:52] <VictorCl2> that requires more than 1 image to work
[15:19:06] <VictorCl2> I want to load a image and when it load it .. apply an effect to it
[15:20:01] <min|dvir|us> simonleojung: You're not still working on it, are you?
[15:21:05] <simonleojung> min|dvir|us: I'm having a look still, i think it's somewhere in the calc
[15:21:22] <min|dvir|us> simonleojung: I'm going to be sarcastic now. Ya think?
[15:21:30] <simonleojung> haha
[15:22:27] <simonleojung> min|dvir|us: yah I'm a bit slow since I'm new to the jQuery API.  I was more of a js freak :D
[15:22:41] <simonleojung> but a friend of mine asked me to join
[15:34:33] <mib_mib> hi guys, I'm trying to dynamically set the size of an iframe when it loads, using this jquery autoheight plugin (https://github.com/house9/jquery-iframe-auto-height) - however, it doesn't work when i dynamically load in an iframe, and then try to run the plugin - whats going on?
[15:35:40] <raiun> hi, when I change an elements id #foo with .attr('id', 'bar')  my $("#foo").click()  rule is still working... i DONT want that to happen, anybody know a fix?
[15:36:35] <anukulrm> did you try unbind() - http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[15:39:06] <htoothrot> wouldn't .live/.delegate be an alternative too
[15:39:38] <mib_mib> why would .live work, if running it doesn't?
[15:39:41] <htoothrot> since it doesn't actually bind to the element, just watches further up the document for a match to the selector
[15:40:40] <draginx1> http://pastie.org/private/qp7dgnxuv7lrus76pr2yq why do I get an unexpected illegal token on line 2?
[15:40:49] <htoothrot> not sure what you mean..
[15:42:13] <raiun> anukulrm: didnt work could be doing it wrong though, here's a pastie  http://pastie.org/2372421
[15:42:27] <raiun> basically i dont want that top condition to run after ive changed the elements id
[15:43:03] <raiun> im running that bottom set of commands before the top one can run a second time, yet it still works
[15:43:38] <mib_mib> anukulrm: unbind didn't work, tried $('iframe').unbind(); and then ran it again and it didn't work
[15:43:43] <anukulrm> try changing the last line to $("#followthis").unbind('click');
[15:43:54] <anukulrm> wait
[15:44:01] <anukulrm> that probably won't help
[15:44:50] <anukulrm> well you should unbind before chaning the id
[15:45:00] <anukulrm> I wonder if that will help
[15:45:25] <raiun> if i unbind it
[15:45:31] <raiun> how can i grab that element to change its id?
[15:45:37] <htoothrot> well, i tested it and .live does seem to work
[15:45:53] <htoothrot> once the id no longer matches, it doesn't fire the event handler
[15:46:01] <raiun> well anu it worked
[15:46:02] <raiun> so thx
[15:46:10] <htoothrot> but whatever, it was just a curiousity
[15:46:24] <amh345> i feel like im on crazy pills right now.  i got my model working but i cant make the click on close work.  or even trigger an alert.    my even a .click on the mask doesnt do anything.
[15:46:37] <amh345> modal*
[15:46:50] <anukulrm> cool raiun
[15:46:54] <lampe> hey sry i dont get it with the parameter's... i wane load a page with jquery and change the url so that i can give it so some one so he can load the page can someone help?
[15:48:11] <anukulrm> you want to change the url but not load it, if I understand you correctly?
[15:48:31] <lampe> anukulrm, i wanne load it and change the url
[15:49:50] <anukulrm> you want to set window.location.href
[15:50:14] <anukulrm> so it would be something like window.location.href = url
[15:50:18] <opius> hi, i want to implement a jquery autocomplete in my asp.net page, how can i populate the array list using alternatetext from images?.. i guess i would need some sort of javascript function to populate the text to a string array, and then call that function from .autocomplete ?
[15:50:24] <draginx1> when would I *not* use javascript templating?
[15:50:41] <opius> im a real beginner on this, so feel free to slap me around, and point me in the right direction :)
[15:51:06] <lampe> anukulrm, yes but now i wane give some one the url and it dont work...
[15:51:38] <opius> actually, i think i just found a solution.. :)
[15:53:01] <anukulrm> what do you mean 'give someone the url'? Why couldn't you just put it in a text input or something?
[15:54:41] <John_Dee> I'm a novice at all of this, but could someone look at http://jsfiddle.net/pXYnw/ and help me figure out why divs vanish if you click back and forth between the buttons?
[15:55:28] <lampe> i got a ajax menu. with load(). and now when i give someone the url: example.com/contact/ i wanne that the contact page should load but i cant find out how
[15:56:56] <treefinguy> hey if I create an element can I have a function execute when it's created/added to the document
[15:57:46] <chjj> you could listen for the dom mutation events, theyre not supported by all browsers though
[15:58:06] <chjj> try DOMSubtreeModified
[15:58:26] <treefinguy> thanks
[15:58:28] <danheberden> or you could just call the function when you create the element
[15:58:33] <chjj> or that ^
[15:58:42] <treefinguy> well I have it like this
[15:58:43] <simonleojung> min|dvir|us: http://jsfiddle.net/jVezK/
[15:59:14] <treefinguy> {"step1": [htmlobject, function(){do_stuff}]}
[15:59:18] <treefinguy> and I want to call do_stuff in a way
[15:59:25] <treefinguy> that $(this) refers to htmlobject
[15:59:49] <sylow> systemfault: fyi, it looks that the 'livequery' plugin helps me out, the event handlers are working again
[16:00:49] <htoothrot> John_Dee, i'm going to say because it moves the actual element in the dom
[16:01:22] <sylow> oh my so much stress to get this working, but at last it's doing what I was looking for
[16:01:57] <John_Dee> is there a way to move it back, instead of hiding the element permanently?
[16:03:27] <treefinguy> chjj danheberden do you think I could do a $.when(a.append()).done(function(x){do_stuff()});
[16:03:41] <danheberden> treefinguy yup
[16:03:49] <danheberden> but a is already in scope
[16:04:08] <danheberden> so you can just to a.append(); /* do-stuff*/
[16:04:08] <treefinguy> but x will refer to the object I added, right?
[16:04:19] <treefinguy> hm
[16:04:21] <danheberden> x will be what you pass into when
[16:04:25] <treefinguy> I guess I am making it to complicated haha
[16:04:29] <treefinguy> too*
[16:05:11] <simonleojung> min|dvir|us: those changes work for me so, try it out and gl.  I'm off to eat
[16:08:17] <mib_mib> htoothrot: it has something to do with the .load method i think, any more ideas how I can get this iframe to resize upon dynamic load? here is the jscript that does it https://github.com/house9/jquery-iframe-auto-height/blob/master/js/jquery.iframe-auto-height.plugin.js
[16:08:33] <treefinguy> <danheberden> so you can just to a.append(); /* do-stuff*/ <<< actually yeah that'll work because then I can just refer to the object as a.lastChild
[16:08:36] <treefinguy> duh! thanks
[16:11:44] <min|dvir|us> simonleojung: Now it's totally broken. :P
[16:13:03] <amh345> mib_mib: i've been looking at this position of modals beside their proper links...   it appears that i might have to append them to the links div/span/whatver. does this sound accurate?  i've been at it for awhile now.
[16:13:17] <amh345> i tried offset. but i couldnt seem to get it to function
[16:15:53] <mib_mib> amh345: i really have no clue what you are trying to append where. If it is always a standard place next to an element, just put an empty div or hidden div next to the element, and do .show() or set the value of the div when needed.
[16:16:03] <danheberden> treefinguy probably better to create the object, append it, and use it
[16:16:36] <danheberden> var created = $( '<div>omg<div>').appendTo( '#somewhere'); /* do something with created */
[16:16:53] <amh345> mib_mib: well there are 50+ elements. each with a modal rollver.  it's the same modal- just different content inside.   i want that modal to appear beside the element.
[16:17:47] <treefinguy> will doing $('<img src="blah.jpg">').appendTo('#place'); create an image element properly danheberden
[16:17:47] <amh345> right now the modal div is at the top of the page. at it just appears along with it's mask. but it needs to be appear beside the proper element
[16:18:33] <danheberden> treefinguy sure - you could also do var $img = $( '<img src="blah.jpg">'); $( '#something').append( $img ); /* do more with $img if you have to */
[16:18:34] <mib_mib> amh345: right, so why not on mouseover of the element, just dynamically add it next to the element?
[16:18:47] <danheberden> you're just creating a dom node, 'tis all
[16:18:49] <treefinguy> ok cool
[16:18:51] <treefinguy> thanks
[16:18:51] <mib_mib> amh345: add it to the DOM....
[16:22:35] <mlk> Hi, is there a way to get all options of a widget?
[16:23:30] <mlk> instead of invoking every single option via ..("option", property)
[16:24:17] <mlk> I need the full options object, but can't seem to find a way to get it
[16:45:55] <notbenh1> hello all, is the roll your own rgb2hex solution I've found ( http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1740700/get-hex-value-rather-than-rgb-value-using-jquery ) still the best way?
[16:46:23] <notbenh1> I was not able to find much for hex via the jquery docs site, though that might not be conclusive
[16:50:40] <mlk> is there a way to get all options of an ui widget? not via xy("option", property)
[16:52:18] <danheberden> mlk $yourDialog.dialog('option'); will return the whole object
[16:53:00] <danheberden> alternatively, $yourDialog.data('dialog').options
[16:56:01] <mib_mib> hi guys, if i have a class that has width:500px, and then i add a class to it that has width:1000px, why doesn't it make the width bigger?
[16:58:03] <mib_mib> rather, if i have <div class="five_hundred_px'>...</div> and i do $('div.five_hundred_px').addClass('thousand_px') -- it doesn't make the div larger, why?
[16:58:38] <amh345> is there a way to get the x/y of a clicked link?
[16:59:11] <amh345> or even perhaps the location of a mouse click.  mouseX and mouseY do not return anything for me
[17:16:43] <KingDosser> I have a function being called that is supposed to create placeholders for legacy browsers but these inputs are being called asynchronously and using html() are place on the page. The call to this function is (in the code) below the use of html() but it still won't work. Any ideas on how I can target those inputs?
[17:24:32] <mcbtay> need help with some jquery stuff, i have it already up on jfiddle if anyone has the time :)
[17:26:11] <abjorn> HARUMPH
[17:28:34] <mcbtay> http://jsfiddle.net/89AVN/10/ there are 2 issues i'm noticing, if you delete the row above the add button, it puts the delete button after the add button, and if you delete the row with the add button in it, i wouldl ike to add it to the alst row if that's possible?
[17:33:46] <Erocanti> http://jsfiddle.net/cyBZ3/ I'm receiving an uncaught execption when running the first of 2 ajax calls. The second call works fine. anyone see where the issue is?
[17:37:46] <wesbos> Erocanti your fiddle is goofed up
[17:38:11] <ciss> hi, how can i tell wether an event handler has been applied with one() or bind() by inspecting the element in firebug?
[17:38:24] <Erocanti> Well, I pasted the error in the HTML part I didnt expect to get the ajax call to work from the fiddle.. ?
[17:38:30] <ciss> i see the events object, i see the handle, but i can't find anything pointing me to it
[17:39:27] <ciss> nevermind, i just figured what's wrong ...
[17:43:13] <treefinguy> is there a way to select the last child of just the top level of children of an element
[17:43:30] <treefinguy> the :last and :last-child selectors will select elements nested way down
[17:47:24] <wesbos> treefinguy is it a unorderd list, or what type of markup?
[17:47:40] <treefinguy> I got it wesbos
[17:47:53] <treefinguy> $('parent > child')
[17:47:56] <wesbos> yep
[17:47:59] <wesbos> was going to suggest that
[17:48:02] <treefinguy> hehe
[17:49:23] <funkster> Is there a way i can have an client side page displayed if for example: client submits a form and their internet connection goes down?
[17:50:20] <wesbos> funkster yeah with offline mode in newer browsers. Check this out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2786303/offline-mode-app-in-a-html5-browser-possible
[17:50:57] <treefinguy> couldn't you also have it display something if the request times out?
[17:58:03] <heshanh> hey guys i have few table rows with ids as id="row122", id="row123" and so on, in each row there are few input txt boxes how can i call a function everytime one of those input boxes loses foucs "blur". or how do i target a id that starts with "row" followed by numbers

[18:02:31] <MatthewWeb> hello
[18:03:23] <MatthewWeb> well I'm a beginner, I watched a shoutbox tut, and learned about setInterval, but I don't know how to do this with the countdown thing I'm making,  I want the time to update every sec how would I do this?
[18:03:47] <MatthewWeb> because whatever I try it doesn't work
[18:06:03] <MatthewWeb> someone please.?
[18:07:27] <mcbtay> djQuery, you wouldn't happen to be in here would ya?
[18:08:31] <MatthewWeb> hey could you help me?
[18:09:49] <mcbtay> nevermind, got my issue fixed
[18:09:56] <mcbtay> and MatthewWeb, i could try
[18:10:42] <MatthewWeb> setInterval, but I don't know how to do this with the countdown thing I'm making,  I want the time to update every sec how would I do this?  because whatever I try it doesn't work

[18:24:11] <SIDU> coldhead: hi ~ glad to see u here :D
[18:24:39] <SIDU> what does this try to replace : preg_replace('/[^0-9,.,a-z,A-Z]/','',$version);
[18:25:11] <systemfault> PHP sucks.
[18:25:20] <SIDU> remove anything not 0-9 . a-z A-Z ?
[18:25:25] <systemfault> Right.
[18:25:45] <SIDU> ok thanks . preg is my headache, i could never understand what it means.
[18:27:23] <dwarder> why do i have to put my script tag inside my html window http://jsfiddle.net/gTkkA/11/
[18:27:35] <dwarder> in order to js function to be found

[18:30:08] <RealSolid> if i have some data i want to call in javascript, is there any way to hide this from the client until theyve clicked something
[18:30:18] <RealSolid> "want to use" rather
[18:31:40] <systemfault> dwarder: Because it wraps everything you write in the javascript window in a $(window).load
[18:32:01] <systemfault> RealSolid: You're a bit vague :/
[18:32:17] <razzi> yeah you gotta define "hide"
[18:32:55] <systemfault> dwarder: But if you were doing it right, you wouldn't have that problem.
[18:33:02] <razzi> if hide means simply "not visible" you can do it with just js, if it means "not present" on the client-side you need to use ajax too
[18:33:14] <Nacho> Does jquery validate if you try to load it twice? I've noticed that it is loading even though it's already loaded and as such removing a plugin.
[18:33:15] <RealSolid> no hide means being unable to view source to determine the data before the click
[18:33:45] <RealSolid> ie i want to have a panel switched to that the client wont know until theyve clicked and it fires off a url to so "theyve clicked here, return this data"-
[18:34:31] <yogurt_truck> any js code you send to the browser can be inspected, RealSolid
[18:34:53] <RealSolid> im fine with that data being available post click, just not pre click
[18:35:49] <kborchers> Nacho: loading jQuery twice will cause issues so you should avoid it. if it's unavoidable, like you're using a broke ass plugin that needs an old version of jQuery, you can use noConflict() to have multiple versions see ?noConflict
[18:35:49] <bot-t1> Nacho, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[18:36:20] <yogurt_truck> RealSolid: do as razzi said, and have your app fetch the data through ajax
[18:37:11] <RealSolid> so set up a callback, then when i receive the data
[18:37:16] <RealSolid> finish the click event?
[18:38:00] <Nacho> Im writing plugins for sharepoint. Each plugin would go in a different embeded code block on SP. For each code block you have to include scripts you want for that code block (because you don't know which plugin blocks you're using so can't see if something was already loaded (elegantly)
[18:38:31] <kborchers> ?yepnope @ Nacho
[18:38:32] <bot-t1> Nacho, yepnope is an asynchronous conditional resource loader that's super-fast, and allows you to load only the scripts that your users need: http://yepnopejs.com/
[18:41:59] <Nacho> Hymm. Thanks
[18:53:20] <fris> im looking to integrate uploading via mobile (ipad), would a html5 uploader be the best bet?
[19:06:23] <coldhead> SIDU: it's a really good idea to get very comfortable with regular expressions. you can use them in so many places
[19:07:30] <abjorn> on the other hand, don't overuse regex ;(
[19:07:58] <SIDU> coldhead: :)
[19:08:21] <abjorn> I see people using regex just to match a word in a string and I'm like "wtfrudoin?"
[19:08:53] <coldhead> i really don't mind if they overuse them, better than overusing string matching without them
[19:09:00] <abjorn> that's true
[19:09:15] <abjorn> although making your code needlessly more complex is still a bad thign
[19:09:30] <abjorn> but yeah
[19:09:31] <abjorn> regex!
[19:09:33] <abjorn> gotta learn it
[19:09:36] <abjorn> esp with javascript
[19:13:11] <yogurt_truck> regex: can't live with them, can't... not... kill? learn..
[19:13:17] <yogurt_truck> learn to... kill them?
[19:13:23] <yogurt_truck> bah nevermind
[19:14:14] <snover> ?regexp
[19:14:14] <bot-t1> Need help? 1) Sample string. 2) Desired result. 3) Your attempt. 4) Bonus points for a plain english description of what you're trying to do. 5) Ask in#regex, they're the experts. http://www.regular-expressions.info/ and http://rj3.net/mdc/regexp
[19:14:23] <snover> got it wrong again.
[19:14:24] <snover> ?regex
[19:14:24] <bot-t1> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think â€œI know, I'll use regular expressions.â€ Now they have two problems.
[19:14:59] <coldhead> lol you were unintentionally helpful
[19:15:03] <yogurt_truck> :>
[19:15:27] <coldhead> you only have to write a finite state machine to match regular expressions to appreciate them for the rest of your days
[19:15:36] <coldhead> there's regularity in those there expressions!
[19:16:04] <yogurt_truck> yeah
[19:19:29] <min|dvir|us> I want to compare two things, including jQuery objects. How?
[19:22:13] <madprops> can i test a regular expression like this else if(!(/?=.*[a-z])/.test($('#inputcontent').val().toLowerCase()))) ?
[19:23:36] <coldhead> madprops: you'd want to make it more readable and do it in a few lines
[19:23:53] <min|dvir|us> Anyone know?
[19:23:58] <coldhead> pity your hungover self looking at that some morning
[19:24:39] <min|dvir|us> coldhead: PYHS. Pity Your Hungover Self.

[19:25:33] <DerNalia> how do I pulsate a grow on text?
[19:25:44] <DerNalia> just need a link to a tutorial
[19:26:27] <min|dvir|us> DerNalia: That question doesn't make sense.
[19:30:46] <yogurt_truck> DerNalia: you mean you want to animate the font size?
[19:31:02] <DerNalia> lol
[19:31:05] <DerNalia> I meant glow
[19:31:07] <DerNalia> not grow
[19:31:25] <DerNalia> r and l are right next to each other (I use Dvorak)
[19:32:31] <yogurt_truck> ah
[19:33:05] <yogurt_truck> you'd probably do something like animating a text-shadow
[19:33:27] <yogurt_truck> for a glow-like effect
[19:33:45] <DerNalia> oh ok, i'll google around for that
[19:35:45] <min|dvir|us> I want to compare two things, including jQuery objects. How?
[19:38:41] <DerNalia> how do you start an animation, and just have it repeat indefinately?
[19:38:55] <min|dvir|us> DerNalia: Use the complete() callback.
[19:39:26] <DerNalia> kk
[19:39:47] <min|dvir|us> DerNalia: You could have figured that out on your own.
[19:40:21] <DerNalia> lol, maybe, some questions get faster answers if just asked.
[19:40:48] <min|dvir|us> DerNalia: Your question would have been answered stupid fast if you would have googled 'jquery animation'.
[19:41:23] <min|dvir|us> >> 1 == 1;

[20:30:55] <[Sergiu]> hello
[20:31:22] <bmh> hi all
[20:31:55] <bmh> im doing some xml parsing with jquery
[20:32:01] <bmh> i've used $.ajax() and got my response, i can find() elements in it, but i'm trying to get the actual content of the notes
[20:32:05] <bmh> +nodes
[20:32:12] <bmh> for example, i've got
[20:32:15] <bmh> alert($(this).find('title').text());
[20:32:42] <bmh> which alerts an empty string, when there is definitely text in each of the "title" nodes
[20:32:57] <bmh> should i be using something other than text() to get the text content of a node?
[20:33:24] <[Sergiu]> i need little help
[20:34:08] <[Sergiu]> i want to use minimize box option , if i add minimize cod to my html file my jq menu style is disabling
[20:34:09] <[Sergiu]> http://jsfiddle.net/z6bjx/
[20:34:23] <kborchers> bmh: you problem may be that you have multiple title nodes. $(this).find('title') will return an array of title nodes so .text() would not work as you expect there. try $(this).find('title')[0].text(); and see what you get
[20:34:34] <[Sergiu]> is needed to rename $(document).ready(function(){ ? or some.. help please
[20:35:49] <opius> can i use autocomplete to return for example all alttexts on a set of images inside a div?
[20:36:47] <bmh> hmm thanks kborchers
[20:37:14] <bmh> heres my xml
[20:37:15] <bmh> http://www.stagingarena.com/sample.xml
[20:37:23] <bmh> its representative of the real stuff i'll be doing
[20:37:38] <bmh> if each "book" will only ever have one "title",
[20:38:38] <bmh> ...how do i get that...
[20:39:13] <kborchers> bmh: get what? a specific title for a specific book?
[20:39:29] <bmh> yeah, so to iterate through all the books and alert() the book title
[20:39:41] <bmh> i've got it iterating through the books,
[20:40:05] <bmh> just need to get the contents of the title element
[20:41:59] <kborchers> assuming $(this) is the xml doc, $(this).children("book").each(function() { console.log($(this).children("title").text(); });  something like that would log all of the book titles to the console
[20:42:00] <bmh> in my loop i've tried
[20:42:01] <austen> Can I have a button?
[20:42:06] <bmh> alert($(this).find('title').text());
[20:42:08] <bmh> and
[20:42:12] <bmh> alert($(this).find('title').each().text());		
[20:42:12] <austen> This button will fit easily into the palm of my hand.
[20:42:18] <austen> And when I push this button...
[20:43:00] <austen> ALL source code and executables based on Internet Explorer anything will simply disappear, forever, never to return to this region of the space-time continuum...
[20:43:48] <RealSolid> can someone change your ajax get url and run your page
[20:43:50] <RealSolid> i assume yes
[20:46:00] <mcbtay> this may be wrong channel, but i'm having trouble with some file permissions?
[20:48:40] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[20:49:03] <bmh> thank kborchers; unfortunately that does the same thing
[20:49:13] <bmh> just empty values for text()
[20:50:14] <kborchers> bmh: you are using an actual xml document and not a string, right? if not, see ?parseXML
[20:50:15] <bot-t1> bmh, jQuery.parseXML() - Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[20:51:20] <bmh> i'm using whatever .ajax() returns... which i assume is an actual xml document
[20:53:14] <bmh> this is my code
[20:53:14] <bmh> http://pastebin.com/kpF92c8k
[20:53:55] <kborchers> bmh: that would just return text, add the dataType: "xml" option
[21:02:02] <bmh> thanks kborchers; however now it's just not doing anything
[21:02:31] <bmh> also, does the mime type the server give have any impact on this?
[21:02:52] <bmh> because i'm finding that if i have sample.php the jquery will do at least some things
[21:02:59] <bmh> however if it's sample.xml; it just simply dies
[21:02:59] <opius> I am such a moron..
[21:03:08] <opius> forgot to include the ui
[21:03:19] <RealSolid> could someone briefly explain what exploits someone can do if i have an ajax request in script
[21:03:56] <kborchers> bmh: i believe it does. instead of the dataType option, go back to the way you had it and try $.parseXML(data).children("book").....
[21:04:43] <chjj> RealSolid: what do you mean?
[21:06:38] <RealSolid> chjj: can someone change the javascript to call a different url for instance
[21:07:44] <chjj> well it depends, if someone was able to inject a script somehow, and you were using a global variable to execute an xhr, yeah its possible
[21:08:00] <chjj> but it would still have to abide by the corss origin policy like any other xhr
[21:08:07] <exitdescription> they can if they're your upstream provider ... *shakes fist*
[21:08:07] <chjj> cross*
[21:08:46] <chjj> RealSolid: i dont understand what the real concern is though, what are you doing exactly?
[21:09:46] <RealSolid> chjj: i mean, cant javascript be changed by a malicious user
[21:09:58] <maqr> "never trust the client"
[21:10:00] <RealSolid> hence they can change the ajax call to whatever they want for instance
[21:10:13] <RealSolid> provided its within the rules, of say, your site or whatevre
[21:10:36] <chjj> it really depends, if youre doing something weird like using a global variable to determine the url of the xhr, yes its possible
[21:10:41] <RealSolid> like if you had "blah.php?userid=1&click=1" as the ajax call
[21:11:01] <chjj> but if someone was able to inject a script onto your page they could just make their own ajax calls
[21:11:25] <RealSolid> they can inject a script from their browser or whatever cant they, they can edit your scripts and run it live
[21:11:41] <RealSolid> so they could change userid=1 to userid=2
[21:11:42] <chjj> hm?
[21:11:47] <RealSolid> in the get url
[21:12:04] <chjj> well if your only security is in the query string, you have bigger problems
[21:12:18] <chjj> people can make http requests to whatever url they want, you cant prevent that
[21:12:19] <RealSolid> yes of course, im just saying, they can change the url to whatever they want
[21:12:30] <exitdescription> i think you need to make the distinction between you, bob, and the origin server
[21:12:53] <ciss> i'm having a little trouble setting the content of an element. i get a response that can be either an html construct or a plain text string. unfortunately html() fails for the plain string. i'd love to have a generic way of handling this, without checking if the string is wrapped or not
[21:13:47] <chjj> el.get(0).innerHTML, or even, el.prop('innerHTML'), although that might do some funky jquery stuff first
[21:14:29] <chjj> but really jquery objects are just array-like objects to el[0].innerHTML is possible, if you want it really close to the metal
[21:14:35] <chjj> so*
[21:15:15] <RealSolid> chjj: i know they can make http requests to anything, but if one page relies on certain data and they can change that data, they can then affect that page, so its somewhat dependent upon the page and ajax requests, if that makes sense
[21:16:05] <chjj> who is "they"? the user? or the person potentially and maliciously injecting scripts?
[21:16:15] <RealSolid> they a malicious user
[21:16:26] <ciss> chij: thanks, i completely forgot about innerHTML
[21:18:02] <chjj> RealSolid: not quite sure what youre saying
[21:18:31] <chjj> if someone can inject scripts to your page, they could change anything
[21:19:08] <snover> oh, are we playing armchair security analyst tonight in #jquery?! :D
[21:19:19] <chjj> im not sure
[21:19:27] <wkmanire> snover: Yes.
[21:19:31] <chjj> im just answering a question
[21:19:33] <snover> AWESOME I LOVE THIS GAME
[21:19:45] <chjj> ...
[21:19:53] <wkmanire> How do I make jQuery do my website?
[21:19:59] <snover> The largest risk from XSS injection is credential theft
[21:19:59] <wkmanire> I want it to be really cool. Like Amazon.com.
[21:20:00] <ciss> crap - i forgot to call parseJSON ...
[21:20:06] <assault14> could someone help me out with keith woods jquery countdown timer?
[21:20:22] <chjj> XSS, what a stupid name
[21:20:36] <chjj> couldnt be more misleading if you tried
[21:21:27] <chjj> because the security "analysts" who discovered didnt know anything about anything worth knowing
[21:21:33] <chjj> =/
[21:21:47] <chjj> or not so much "discovered it" but decided to name it
[21:21:52] <chjj> so it could become a buzz word
[21:21:57] <assault14> im trying to have the counter count down 24hrs each day and not reset when the page is reloaded
[21:22:00] <chjj> </rant>
[21:42:31] <Bower^> If I load the jquery library near the closing <body> tag it produces CSS validation errors, I have to put it in the <head>. Is this normal? :/
[21:43:23] <Bower^> Sorry I should be more clear, my web developer add-on for firefox that does CSS validation produces two validation errors
[21:44:24] <[Sergiu]> Can help me someone to add dialog effect from Example1/2 to my Menu? http://178.32.137.37/tools/

[22:02:58] <jeffreyjames> does anyone know what service corresponds to the 3rd icon from the left in this image? http://imageshack.us/f/690/ss20100608093704.png/ (top row)
[22:03:00] <ciss> Bower^: what errors exactly?
[22:03:18] <jeffreyjames> it just say "jagg" but google finds nothing
[22:03:23] <Bower^> ciss, "Error in parsing value for 'left'. Declaration dropped" and "Error in parsing value for 'right'. Declaration dropped"
[22:03:30] <Bower^> Most strange.
[22:03:31] <ciss> Bower^: and no, it's not normal :)
[22:03:33] <Bower^> I can provide a fiddle
[22:03:42] <ciss> that would be great
[22:03:46] <Bower^> It is literally the placement of the <script> that produces it
[22:03:54] <Bower^> Sure, one sec
[22:05:39] <ciss> jeffreyjames: might be some single-language thingy that's not known beyond the virtual borders ...
[22:06:12] <jeffreyjames> that makes sense. I was just thinking about trying international search
[22:06:24] <ciss> jeffreyjames: http://www.jagg.cz/
[22:07:09] <ciss> jeffreyjames: added "odkazy" to the search and found it immediately
[22:07:10] <jeffreyjames> ah, thanks. looks like social bookmark sharing site
[22:07:33] <Bower^> ciss, http://jsfiddle.net/SjRyn/ - Doesn't produce the error. http://jsfiddle.net/SjRyn/1/ - Produces the error. jQuery v1.6.2
[22:07:51] <ciss> jeffreyjames: that layout looks *very* familiar ... just a sec
[22:08:31] <ciss> jeffreyjames: like i thought: they're using scuttle
[22:08:46] <jeffreyjames> heh, it DOES look familiar
[22:08:50] <Bower^> ciss, please note I get identical results when the other two <script> elements are removed
[22:08:52] <jeffreyjames> even the gradient and icon colors
[22:09:09] <ciss> jeffreyjames: i guess it's because they didn't change anything ^^
[22:09:21] <ciss> Bower^: looking ...
[22:09:45] <jeffreyjames> heh, nope. those lazy czechs devs...
[22:10:33] <ciss> Bower^: hm. i'm getting a bunch of 404's
[22:10:44] <Bower^> I haven't set-up the fiddle correctly
[22:10:53] <Bower^> That's the HTML
[22:11:02] <ciss> yep, wrong paths
[22:11:05] <Bower^> and it references the jQuery.js library I downloaded
[22:12:42] <Bower^> jquery must be doing something to the CSS to invalidate it
[22:13:03] <ciss> Bower^: just a wild guess (you never know): try adding type="text/javascript"
[22:13:11] <ciss> Bower^: unlikely
[22:13:31] <ciss> keep out your other two scripts, check, then add them one by one
[22:13:40] <Bower^> No dice
[22:14:59] <ciss> ok then, lets try a real world example: you can use http://paste.pocoo.org/ to paste your scripts and include them directly into another fiddle
[22:15:50] <Bower^> Dude even http://jsfiddle.net/u2fBB/ produces the error
[22:16:19] <vick_> http://screencast.com/t/x8xeCO0Vo how do I hide the arrows??
[22:17:25] <jackandcoke> sup
[22:17:36] <ciss> Bower^: i'm not seeing any errors: http://jsfiddle.net/u2fBB/1/
[22:17:45] <ciss> Bower^: might wanna redownload your jquery
[22:18:23] <Bower^> http://jsfiddle.net/u2fBB/3/
[22:18:30] <Bower^> Still does it with a direct link
[22:20:00] <Bower^> hehe
[22:20:04] <wite> Hey guys, I'm using jQuery.getScript() to fetch a JS file and I can see it load in the chrome inspectors network tab, but it doesn't execute and I can't call any of the functions inside the loaded js. Anyone know why that would be?
[22:20:08] <Bower^> 1.6.1 doesn't produce the error ciss
[22:20:21] <ciss> i'm still not seeing any errors
[22:20:27] <Bower^> wtf
[22:20:33] <ciss> what browser are you testing in?
[22:20:49] <Bower^> FF 5.0
[22:20:51] <Bower^> web developer add-on
[22:21:00] <Cork> wite: have you made sure the file is valid (parses, and validates in ex. jslint)?
[22:21:03] <Bower^> that's doing the CSS validation
[22:21:29] <wite> Cork: No i haven't. I'll go do that
[22:21:34] <ciss> Bower^: FF 3.6.19 - WD and Firebug
[22:21:52] <Bower^> http://jsfiddle.net/u2fBB/4/ - 1.6.1 and no error
[22:21:56] <Bower^> I have Firebug too
[22:22:14] <[Sergiu]> Can help me someone to add dialog effect to my menu? :) http://178.32.137.37/tools/ , i need effect from Example 1
[22:22:17] <ciss> Bower^: sorry, i was looking for js errors the whole time ^^
[22:22:18] <[Sergiu]> Please!
[22:22:23] <Bower^> ciss lol :D
[22:22:33] <Bower^> "Error in parsing value for 'left'. Declaration dropped" and "Error in parsing value for 'right'. Declaration dropped" - errors in question
[22:23:04] <ciss> Bower^: might wanna paste the offending css
[22:24:18] <Bower^> ciss, there is no offended CSS
[22:24:24] <Bower^> the fiddle is it
[22:24:30] <Bower^> offending*
[22:24:46] <Bower^> like I've been saying, the jquery library *is* causing the CSS to become invalid
[22:24:51] <Bower^> 1.6.2
[22:25:00] <Bower^> 1.6.1 doesn't produce those two CSS errors
[22:27:52] <Cork> Bower^: looks like its firefox getting messed up about parts in the jQuery.support block
[22:28:21] <Bower^> Should I stick with 1.6.1?
[22:28:35] <Cork> na, most likly a parsing bug in firefox
[22:29:06] <Bower^> The red cross for invalidation makes me feel dirty though :(
[22:29:25] <Cork> Bower^: what could be interesting is using http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.2.js
[22:29:37] <Cork> and ripping parts out until you find what lines causes it
[22:30:08] <Bower^> That might take a while :P
[22:30:14] <Cork> not really
[22:30:16] <madprops> hi
[22:30:32] <Cork> just remove each line that has left: in them
[22:30:36] <Cork> thats not that many
[22:30:41] <Bower^> ah true
[22:30:46] <madprops> im trying to make a div #op go right below #id im trying to do this http://jsfiddle.net/aeqGA/ what's the proper way to do this?
[22:32:10] <Cork> madprops: is both absolute positioned?
[22:33:31] <madprops> Corey, Cork yes, they also share the exact same style attributes
[22:35:24] <Cork> madprops: $(op).css('top',  $(id).position() + $(id).outerHeight(true));
[22:35:40] <Cork> (remove true if you don't want to include the margin for the element)
[22:35:49] <Bower^> Cork, could be line 8830
[22:35:52] <Cork> gah... forgot one thing
[22:35:58] <Cork> madprops: $(op).css('top',  $(id).position().top + $(id).outerHeight(true));
[22:36:34] <Bower^> If I comment out that line, I just get some javascript validation error
[22:36:59] <Bower^> it mentions top and left too
[22:36:59] <Cork> Bower^: your sure?
[22:37:07] <Bower^> Yup
[22:37:27] <Cork> i would expect one of the lines where they use things like left: left or something like that...
[22:37:51] <Bower^> To be precise the js error is "missing ; before return statement"
[22:38:01] <Bower^> CSS validates though
[22:38:22] <madprops> Corey, it's putting op at the same position as id
[22:38:49] <Cork> madprops: same position??
[22:39:06] <madprops> Cork, like one on top of the other
[22:39:07] <Bower^> Ignore what I said cork, I fixed the JS error and it produces the CSS ones now :)
[22:40:11] <madprops> Cork, no wait
[22:40:14] <Cork> Bower^: just rip complete functions out around the left: parts
[22:40:28] <Cork> as all your doing is parsing the js file, it shouldn't cause js errors
[22:41:13] <Bower^> Hmm I've gone through everything and can't nail it
[22:41:20] <Cork> Bower^: when you've found the affending function, its simpler to disect and find the exact line
[22:41:21] <Superstar> Hello all
[22:43:21] <Bower^> I think I'll just load the jquery library in the <head> until a later version sorts this out
[22:43:50] <Cork> Bower^: the thing is, if no one reports it it might not be fixed
[22:44:05] <Bower^> I would have thought someone has come across this
[22:44:09] <Bower^> and reported it
[22:44:40] <Cork> most ppl load the libs in the header, might take a while
[22:44:51] <Bower^> Yeah :/
[22:44:57] <Bower^> I could use 1.6.1
[22:45:44] <Bower^> Screw it, I'll submit a bug report
[22:46:13] <Bower^> Well I'll search first :)
[22:46:34] <Cork> the thing is, it might be a bug you should file agest firefox not jquery
[22:46:45] <Cork> *agenst
[22:46:52] <ciss> Bower^: no sympathy from my side - i'm forced to work with 1.2.6, which misses almost *all* the cool features :/
[22:47:09] <Bower^> good point cork
[22:47:17] <Bower^> hehe why is that ciss?
[22:47:28] <ciss> drupal 6.
[22:48:01] <Cork> ciss: updating jquery in drupal isn't that hard
[22:48:08] <ciss> a lot of modules that tend to break
[22:48:12] <Cork> theres even a plugin for that
[22:48:24] <Cork> (that does backwards compatibility)
[22:48:39] <ciss> ok, now you got me interested
[22:49:13] <Cork> ciss: http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update
[22:49:27] <Cork> opps wrong link
[22:50:50] <Cork> ciss: heh that was the right link, looks like they've changed the module pages quite a bit since i last used drupal :)
[22:53:16] <ciss> Cork: looking at the module source - i'm not seeing any kind of compatbility layer, it just replaces 1.2.6 with 1.3.2. we've tried that once, saw the mess and went back immediately
[22:55:30] <Cork> ciss: yupp, looks like they don't do that anymore
[22:55:57] <Cork> ciss: i used it about two years back, and it did then
[22:56:15] * Cork is free from drupal now days :)
[22:57:10] <ciss> because you've passed that torch along or because you've found another cms/framework?
[22:57:37] <Cork> ciss: we'r on rails/go now days
[22:57:53] <Cork> ciss: and the drupal team is to annoying to work with
[22:58:12] <Cork> we hit a major bug in the search indexer, filed a bug, with a patch
[22:58:19] <Cork> but they didn't bother to submit it
[22:58:32] <Cork> ca 1 year later they closed the bug as won't fix
[22:58:53] <Cork> then we started to look for something better
[22:59:13] <ciss> and now you've written your own cms?
[22:59:25] <Cork> well not really cms
[22:59:39] <Cork> but rails has quite managable views
[22:59:43] <ciss> a gets-the-job-done-system? :)
[22:59:45] <Cork> so we'r doing it that way
[22:59:52] <Cork> ciss: exactly
[23:00:24] <Cork> looks like php is on the brink of dying anyway so...
[23:01:03] <ciss> how so?
[23:01:04] <Superstar> How do I convert the form handler to work for multiple forms? i.e. 002, 003, 004 etc on this: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/666239/
[23:01:22] <Cork> ciss: oracle has more or less droped all development
[23:01:40] <jtannenbaum> http://i.imgur.com/YsH4i.png <- I'd like the + link here to make another two <select>s below the previous selects. However, this is part of a form so they'd have to be named selecta_2 and selectb_2 or whatnot. What's the best solution to this? I'm using django in the backend.
[23:02:08] <Bower^> Well I just submitted a ticket for it Cork
[23:02:17] <Bower^> So it's out there
[23:02:18] <Cork> Bower^: you have a number?
[23:02:18] <Superstar> Is it possible to dynamically get the object id?
[23:02:28] <Bower^> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10054
[23:02:43] <Cork> Bower^: theres been parsing error bugs before
[23:02:50] <Bower^> I see
[23:02:54] <Cork> Bower^: and jquery has been reluctant to fix them
[23:02:57] <Bower^> :/
[23:03:46] <ciss> Cork: i fail to see the connection between that and php's future
[23:04:15] <Cork> ciss: php6 might never come
[23:04:35] <silv3r_m00n> is there a method to convert a an object to json string ?
[23:04:49] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: what kind of object?
[23:04:57] <Cork> jsut a raw js object?
[23:05:01] <silv3r_m00n> its a json object
[23:05:03] <Cork> or does it have elements in it?
[23:05:07] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: sure
[23:05:09] <Superstar> Would this work? $($(this).attr('id')).click(function() { }
[23:05:15] <silv3r_m00n> how ?
[23:05:17] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: JSON.stringify
[23:05:33] <Cork> Superstar: almost
[23:05:44] <silv3r_m00n> thanks
[23:05:48] <Cork> Superstar: ('#' + $(this).attr('id')).click(function() { });
[23:06:06] <Superstar> Cork thank you very much
[23:06:13] <Cork> Superstar: but you might want to use live and a class instead
[23:06:58] <phoe6> var name = name || {};
[23:07:26] <Cork> phoe6?
[23:07:40] <phoe6> if name is not defined, it would beundefined and undefined || {}; returns {}. That is my understanding.
[23:07:48] <phoe6> let me pull up fiddler.
[23:08:02] <phoe6> is that correct and my question is "why" is this used?
[23:08:23] <Cork> phoe6: that is correct
[23:08:54] <madprops> is there a way to copy to the clipboard without using flash?
[23:09:14] <Cork> and its how you compactly set default values for optional arguments
[23:09:41] <phoe6> var name = name || {}; and I further see that
[23:09:42] <phoe6> name.dir = name.dir || {};
[23:09:42] <phoe6> name.dir.namespace = name.dir.namespace || function (a) {};
[23:09:44] <Cork> madprops: you can capture paste events
[23:09:51] <phoe6> that is a style of doing namespace, I suppose.
[23:09:56] <Cork> madprops: but it only works in newer browsers
[23:10:08] <chjj> just a note: name = name || {}; is less performant than if (!name) name = {};
[23:10:17] <chjj> but it doesnt really matter
[23:10:54] <Cork> chjj: not really, it will give pointer name then adress number from pointer name
[23:11:09] <chjj> its less performant, benchmark it
[23:11:12] <Cork> chjj: so its actually faster then a full if jump loop
[23:11:54] <chjj> youre setting a variable when you dont have to, unless the engine optimizies it out (which i at least know v8 doesnt) it will be less performant
[23:13:04] <phoe6> What is a type(window) in js?
[23:13:05] <chjj> other engines could be different
[23:13:09] <chjj> i guess im only speaking for v8
[23:13:16] <phoe6> I meant type of (window) object?
[23:13:26] <chjj> you mean typeof? :)
[23:13:37] <chjj> it should return object
[23:14:10] <phoe6> I could do a dir(window)
[23:14:27] <chjj> hm?
[23:14:38] <phoe6> typeof I was expecting the Object type (if there any special kind of object) for representing window
[23:14:51] <chjj> its just an object
[23:15:13] <phoe6> anything special about it?
[23:15:28] <chjj> you *can* do Object.prototype.toString.call(window) on it, and you might get back something funky like '[object Window]'
[23:15:33] <chjj> or '[object DOMWindow]'
[23:15:34] <chjj> etc
[23:15:40] <chjj> it varies from rendering engine
[23:15:45] <phoe6> I see.
[23:15:50] <chjj> if you want to test for it
[23:15:55] <chjj> you can look for any global function
[23:16:06] <chjj> they all sit on the global object, which, in the browsers case, is window
[23:16:23] <chjj> theyre non-enumerable, but theyre there
[23:16:27] <tom> hi
[23:16:41] <tom> so i made something the the j of the query today
[23:17:21] <GonZa> hi to everyone! - I'm trying to add a text inside the jquery dialog button set panel (kinda reference text like "Bold fields are required..." .. dunno how can be done. I've tried to add finding ".ui-dialog-buttonset"
[23:19:43] <chjj> git loh
[23:19:45] <chjj> damn
[23:19:56] <chjj> that was a double fail
[23:20:04] <chjj> i even misspelled log
[23:20:36] <Cork> 1.927 vs 2.57, on in milione executions, so ya, but i can't say i care
[23:20:46] <Cork> chjj: ^
[23:20:55] <Cork> in==one
[23:21:14] <chjj> huh? yeah, i dont care either, i said it doesnt really matter
[23:21:22] <chjj> its a trivial amount of perf youd be squeezing out
[23:21:57] <chjj> personally i use the pipe style most of the time because it looks better
[23:22:08] <Cork> and the code becomes less readable if you want lint to like you
[23:22:14] <Cork> ya
[23:22:35] <chjj> i hope not jslint, terrible piece of garbage
[23:22:56] <Superstar> Cork, I tried this but it doesn't submit the form, $('#' + $(this).attr('id')).click(function() { $('#f001').submit(); });
[23:23:32] <Cork> Superstar: thats a bit too much out of context...
[23:23:40] <Superstar> Oh
[23:29:53] <tom> anyway, so i made a little search engine thing using the j to the query today. I call it "I'm the internet, ask me anything." http://itiama.tk/

[23:46:11] <innociv> Does firefox beta6 have issues with jquery.each()?
[23:46:24] <innociv> I'm getting object is undefinited on length = object.length
[23:48:33] <twoface> and what is 'object' ?

[23:49:40] <innociv> It's in jquery 1.6.2 source.
[23:49:54] <innociv> I only get the error in firefox not chrome
[23:50:41] <innociv> Cork, no i mean errors in the console that point it jquery instead of my code.
[23:50:47] <Cork> innociv: never seen an error from each
[23:50:55] <Cork> and i'v been on ff trunk for years
[23:51:01] <innociv> I only got the error after updating to the new FF beta it seems

[23:51:15] <phoe6> answering my question
[23:51:43] <Cork> innociv: whats the object your looping over?
[23:53:32] <innociv> Part of some json data.
[23:53:34] <innociv> moment
[23:55:20] <innociv> json.data.posts that's returned from an ajax call.  Hm it seems its fucking up on the old firefox too..
[23:56:13] <austen> Internet Explorer is shit. Yes? No?
[23:56:52] <phoe6> austen: No
[23:56:52] <chjj> is that even a question?
[23:56:54] <Bower^> 6 certainly is and needs to die a horrible death
[23:57:13] <innociv> 9 and 10 are okay
[23:57:19] <Bower^> yeah
[23:57:21] <chjj> Bower^: why do i get the impression that the implication there is >ie6 are okay?
[23:57:42] <innociv> 7 is about as bad as 6.
[23:57:59] <chjj> ie6 is dead, if you still support ie6 youre evil
[23:58:08] <chjj> same with
[23:58:09] <chjj> ie7
[23:58:11] <chjj> and ie8
[23:58:20] <chjj> and possibly ie9, in fact, never support ie
[23:58:37] <austen> Unfortunately, unless you have Windows > xp, you're stuck with 8
[23:59:01] <austen> Don't know if that's true with vista, but I don't have vista so I can't check...
[23:59:16] <chjj> imagine if ie9/10 are huge success, microsoft gets their marketshare back, what will they do? just sit on it while the web goes to hell, like they did with ie6
[23:59:42] <chjj> dont support ie at all, they dont deserve it, there is nothing microsoft could do to get me to ever forgive them
[23:59:46] <chjj> for what theyve done to the web
[23:59:57] <Bower^> I can't see it getting enough market share that competitors aren't an issue to let them get lazy like that
