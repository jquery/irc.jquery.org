[00:24:11] <Kythlo> hi, im trying to use ajax to post value from a textbox into a php file but my $_POST['input'] is not reciving any data. here is my code
[00:24:46] <Kythlo> http://pastebin.com/YNq524us line 45 is where i set up the ajax query and line 32 is where im trying to have it filled
[00:29:48] <Kythlo> any help would be highly appreciative
[01:07:29] <CrowX-> interesting how this channel is full of activity during work days, and dead-ish in the weekend
[01:08:14] <beancurd> heh, amusing.
[02:55:30] <tristan1990> Hey. I've got a real noob problem in that I'm using the Geocomplete plugin for jquery. I'm trying to get it displaying Google Places details using the API. I can get it to display most other properties on the 'top level' but don't know how to get to the Open_now object
[02:55:40] <tristan1990> I think its really simple, and heres my little project https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35104004/geocomplete-new.zip
[02:55:55] <tristan1990> It's using the form.html as my page
[04:02:08] <badcom> Is it possible to set focus on a different tab? It seems that the window.focus only works if an alert has been called on that tab?
[04:49:30] <rahuldroy> Hi guys, just wondering how you would check if "data-toggle" attribute exists in the parent of the select element
[05:05:31] <joroci> $element.parent().attr('data-toggle')
[05:07:52] <rahuldroy> $('input[type=radio]:checked').parent().parent().attr('data-toggle')
[05:09:22] <rahuldroy> joroci, reckon that will work correctly??
[05:12:44] <Snoopal> hey guys im using $(window).width(); but it gives me a wrong width back? window is 768px broad and i get 753 as result?
[05:14:30] <karsten_> Hi!
[05:15:45] <karsten_> Please can you tell me, what ive done wrong? Please visit this side http://solarinvert.tom-develop.com/unternehmen/referenzen/ and click "Anlage Daten" blue button of list elements an watch animation please.
[05:16:01] <rahuldroy> @snoopal, I just tried it is working as described
[05:16:07] <karsten_> the animation stucks and isnt fluently in chrome
[05:16:22] <Jattenalle> Snoopal, margin? padding? scrollbar?
[05:16:31] <Snoopal> there is a scrollbar
[05:16:43] <Jattenalle> Snoopal, that'd do it
[05:17:10] <Snoopal> is there any way to get the right size of the window? because on some pages i will have no scrollbar
[05:17:19] <Snoopal> so this is a bit hard to make it ready for smaller devices :/
[05:17:22] <Jattenalle> well it returns the usable width
[05:17:30] <Jattenalle> so it's correct
[05:18:59] <Snoopal> is there a way to get the width of scrollbar ?
[05:19:17] <Jattenalle> well, it doesnt matter, does it?
[05:19:24] <Jattenalle> since you cant put content there anyhow
[05:20:15] <Snoopal> it matters because according to its size i need to have other effects/triggers etc.
[05:45:45] <FrankDWork> has anyone seen any issues with FireFox + Ajax? I'm making a request w/ $.ajax() and FF resubmits the request as soon as the first one request returns data
[05:46:06] <FrankDWork> then when the second one returns data, nothing is filled via the function defined under success
[05:46:29] <FrankDWork> it doesnt happen all the time, im not sure exactly what triggers it
[05:47:23] <FrankDWork> actually it looks like it triggers the error after the second request returns
[05:47:31] <FrankDWork> im just not sure why its retrying :\
[06:50:25] <FrankDWork> hellooo
[06:51:30] <Snoopal> would be easier if you paste your code somewhere
[06:58:52] <FrankDWork> http://pastebin.com/QYL3KY9S
[06:59:06] <FrankDWork> super simple
[07:22:18] <DragonStorm> hey guys, i need help. I am trying to make "input"s dynamic so I wrote a js function to create them. Now i want to add a "keyup" listener. But it doesn't work. Firebug tells me, that .keyup is not a function. I looked up in the net but no answer to my problem... I already made a pastebin file: http://pastebin.com/2vKqXDzp
[08:12:14] <narutimateum> hello humans
[08:13:49] <TheWhisper> Anyone know of a way to get content from files in one github repo
[08:13:59] <TheWhisper> and load them inline on a website?
[08:36:03] <tjbenator> Anyone ever created a bookmarklet to send post data to a server?
[08:37:02] <kollex> hi everybody! I just would like to ask if there is any possibility to link points (and make them active) on image map through jquery library and to link them with short texts (like information about those points on map; imagine something like route map). Or if there is any plugin to help with that problem. Thank you. I am new at jquery. It can be also another technology, not jquery only. Thank you for any information or help how to proceed.
[08:38:59] <owizz> Hello everyone
[08:39:14] <jphase> TheWhisper: you can use GitHub's raw URL structure for that
[08:39:58] <TheWhisper> jphase, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ etc?
[08:40:06] <jphase> yeah
[08:40:30] <owizz> Simple question how can I add content below of last class div?
[08:40:35] <TheWhisper> Thanks, jphase
[08:40:41] <jphase> np
[08:41:09] <jphase> owizz: $('<div>stuff to insert</div>').insertAfter($('.mydiv'))
[08:41:38] <owizz> but i've got like 100 of the same divs how can i add content only below the last one?
[08:41:46] <jphase> oh
[08:41:51] <jphase> owizz: $('<div>stuff to insert</div>').insertAfter($('.mydiv:last'))
[08:42:07] <owizz> thank you :)
[08:42:10] <jphase> np
[08:45:43] <TheWhisper> jphase, so say I have a github repo "blog" that uses octopress
[08:46:00] <TheWhisper> and I want to have any new blog posts automatically be loaded inline on mysite.com
[08:46:44] <TheWhisper> Any idea if that's even possible?
[08:47:10] <tjbenator> So if I have the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" header set on my site, I should be able to create a bookmarklet that sends post data to it from any domain correct?
[08:47:39] <jphase> TheWhisper: I'm not familiar with octopress, but blog posts in most systems are database-driven. Are there files inside the repo for each blog post?
[08:47:58] <jphase> tjbenator: you should be able to do CORS requests from any domain, yes
[08:48:01] <TheWhisper> Octopress is based off Jekyll, so it's generated and then deployed as static
[08:48:03] <TheWhisper> no database
[08:48:09] <TheWhisper> and yes, there are files inside the repo for each post
[08:50:02] <jphase> TheWhisper: well you'd have to have some way of grabbing the URLs to access via raw in order for that to work. Let me see if this is even possible, one sec
[08:50:15] <TheWhisper> mhm
[08:50:49] <tjbenator> jphase: For what ever reason, I am getting errors in javascript stating that the header isn't set. If I do "curl -i url" it returns the CORS headers
[08:51:20] <jphase> TheWhisper: it looks like CORS requests to github aren't allowed, so you'd have to do this with a server-side language as opposed to jQuery unless you used a CORS proxy
[08:51:23] <FrankDWork> so
[08:51:36] <FrankDWork> i have a case of probably bad app design, where we ask the server to do something in an Ajax request that takes a Very Long Time
[08:51:39] <TheWhisper> hm
[08:51:42] <FrankDWork> it works fine in Chrome
[08:51:52] <FrankDWork> but in Firefox the socket is reset by the time the server responds
[08:52:02] <FrankDWork> chrome sends TCP keepalives
[08:52:31] <FrankDWork> so since the socket dies, Firefox goes to retry the Ajax request.. server goes and does its thing, goes to respond back, and the socket is closed
[08:52:43] <FrankDWork> Firefox pops an error at that point ^^
[08:52:49] <FrankDWork> anything I can do about that?
[08:53:06] <jphase> tjbenator: you might want to create a jsfiddle so someone can further assist. hard to say without seeing the code.
[08:53:29] <FrankDWork> actually -- thats not entirely accurate, I'm not sure why the socket dies. There's no keepalive, but I don't think anything forcefully closes the socket (I don't see a FIN/ACK)
[08:53:41] <TheWhisper> jphase: I think it's probably just a lot easier for me to make html pages for each post instead of using a blogging platform then lol
[08:56:22] <jphase> TheWhisper: I personally think it'd be easier to not use an unnecessary medium like github. Keep your blog posts local on the environment you're working in if you can ;)
[08:56:30] <TheWhisper> yeah
[08:56:44] <shoky> TheWhisper jphase: you can load via CORS from rawgit.com
[08:56:54] <TheWhisper> Yeah, but that's not for production
[08:56:55] <jphase> nope
[08:56:58] <jphase> oh
[08:57:01] <jphase> rawgit.com sorry
[08:57:19] <jphase> no, I'm unable to
[08:58:34] <jphase> but you could use http://www.corsproxy.com/rawgit.com   ;)
[08:59:18] <shoky> jphase: working fine for me from rawgit.com
[09:00:00] <shoky> you need a text dataType if you're loading a .js file
[09:00:45] <jphase> hmm, I get XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://rawgit.com/. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Perhaps it's different from a direct file or something.
[09:02:19] <shoky> https
[09:02:23] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/r6YL5/
[09:03:25] <jphase> oh, whoops
[09:08:23] <Kythlo> hi, http://pastebin.com/HW2sDz3y line 37 im trying to connect jquery.js file but its not working
[09:08:35] <Kythlo> not sure why, my jquery is same folder as the webpage.
[09:09:10] <shoky> Kythlo: you need to close the script tag </script>
[09:09:16] <shoky> Kythlo: and open a new one for your inline code
[09:09:29] <Kythlo> oh
[09:09:39] <Kythlo> will try right now thanks .
[09:10:50] <tjbenator> Bookmarklet -> http://pastebin.com/NcpTPtjD
[09:17:54] <Kythlo> Hmm, so i got that stuff working but now its really not working as i hoped
[09:18:32] <Kythlo> like on keyup and keydown i just hoping it would echo w/e is in my input textbox but instead it reposting the whole element
[09:19:46] <Kythlo> line 8 is what i want working and line 17 is calling the function , line 45 holds the function
[09:20:09] <TheWhisper> okay
[09:20:10] <TheWhisper> I have
[09:20:12] <TheWhisper> 			panel.load('./articles/article1.html');
[09:20:16] <TheWhisper> wait
[09:20:22] <TheWhisper> nvm
[09:21:01] <Kythlo> http://pastebin.com/YtvygqN2 here is updated code please help
[09:23:40] <jphase> Kythlo: all sorts of things I'd recommend changing here... starting with the inline onkeyup attribute - use jQuery to bind events, that's half of the magic with it.
[09:24:11] <jphase> secondly, mysql_query is deprecated in newer versions of PHP so you should use PDO or mysqli (unrelated topic to this channel)
[09:24:32] <Kythlo> im just using that event for now just see if it will do want it to
[09:24:54] <Kythlo> i will take note of that
[09:26:12] <Kythlo> any idea why $_POST['input'] is not getting filled?
[09:26:15] <jphase> Kythlo: also, if you're doing ajax calls to echo out what was posted, perhaps you want to die() instead of echo so you don't get the entire page contents?
[09:26:55] <jphase> hmm, not really no, your .post() call should fill in $_POST['input']
[09:27:13] <jphase> you've confirmed the event is firing and things look good in your network tab?
[09:28:06] <Kythlo> im pretty sure the network is firing because its posting line 17
[09:28:24] <Kythlo> the event***
[09:29:08] <jphase> and this file is called itemupdate.php ?
[09:29:32] <Kythlo> yep, its the same file ur seeing the code in
[09:30:31] <jphase> what's happening exactly? what's the issue?
[09:31:01] <jphase> $_POST['input'] is not set?
[09:31:05] <Kythlo> so basically what i thought would be happen when i type something in line 17 textbox it would call event and post info into INPUT varible in php line 8
[09:31:32] <Kythlo> but php is giving me a msg of Notice: Undefined index: input in C:\xampp\htdocs\intergrationProject\itemupdate.php on line 8
[09:32:03] <jphase> Kythlo: if php isn't getting $_POST['input'] then you need to check your network tab to make sure your post has values
[09:32:18] <Kythlo> sorry, how do i do that? im new this
[09:32:38] <Kythlo> kk i have the network tab up
[09:32:44] <jphase> Kythlo: open up your developer tools, post again
[09:32:56] <jphase> with network tab active
[09:33:07] <Kythlo> it says post 200 ok
[09:33:17] <jphase> look at the values that posted across
[09:33:26] <jphase> look for input:
[09:33:53] <Kythlo> so click the file ? itemupdate.php?
[09:34:04] <jphase> yeah, then you'll see some tabs
[09:34:08] <jphase> like headers response etc.
[09:34:27] <Kythlo> X-Requested-With:XMLHttpRequest Form Dataview sourceview URL encoded input:test
[09:34:27] <jphase> in your headers I think there'll be the post values
[09:35:10] <Kythlo> yes its posting
[09:35:20] <Kythlo> input:sdfsd
[09:35:47] <jphase> hehe, well the you somehow figured out how to break php lol.   echo '<pre>'; print_r($_POST); echo '</pre>';
[09:36:12] <Kythlo> da F lol
[09:36:25] <Kythlo> kk let me try
[09:37:43] <Kythlo> something odd shows up
[09:38:03] <Kythlo> Array ( )
[09:38:11] <Kythlo> but the msg is gone
[09:38:44] <jphase> yeah, that means your $_POST array is not set at all.
[09:40:47] <Kythlo> oh
[09:40:55] <Kythlo> so i need to store input into an array?
[09:41:32] <jphase> no, $_POST is an array of posted values
[09:41:35] <jphase> it should be set
[09:42:16] <Kythlo> okay so what should i change to see an output
[09:43:16] <jphase> I'm at a loss. You need to test the basics. Put a form on the page method="post" and post something with name="input" in it
[09:43:47] <jphase> there's too much going on in this that is outside of the way I normally do it it's tough to debug from a pastebin tbh
[09:46:23] <Kythlo> yeah sorry, im fairly new to both php and javascript. but id like to move forward with this since it posting a value. I want use w/e input to update a database, So my plan is to have update button post all data from  various textboxes and send that info to php
[09:46:51] <Kythlo> will it work the way I have setup with a slightest changes ?
[09:48:38] <jphase> probably, but I'd suggest doing it the right way.
[09:49:00] <jphase> something is wrong with the the post, and I have no clue what it would be if your network tab looks good
[09:49:23] <Kythlo> you mind if  I pm u ?
[09:49:27] <beancurd>  aoeuoeuaoeuaoeu;q:q
[09:49:41] <jphase> go ahead
[09:50:01] <beancurd> woops. lag.
[09:51:06] <otherr> Hi is anyone here?  I have a question about this script : http://jsfiddle.net/jW68r/ .
[09:52:27] <Clex> ?ask @ otherr
[09:52:27] <b-ot> otherr: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:53:09] <otherr> Clex : my question is how does the line " $('#test').text(realData).css({color: 'green'}); " work in : http://jsfiddle.net/jW68r/ .
[09:55:37] <Clex> $('#test') grabs the "test" element, .text(realData) sets the text value and .css({color: 'green'}) sets the CSS property "color" to "green" for this element.
[09:56:53] <otherr> Clex : is there a way with jquery to set realData to a variable I can use in a later javascript functin?
[09:56:54] <otherr> function?
[09:57:29] <Clex> You want to save the realData value?
[09:57:47] <otherr> Yes as a variable I can use in a later javascript function ideally.
[09:58:08] <Clex> Well, you can assign it to another variable.
[09:58:20] <otherr> Just as easy as that I dont need to use jquery?
[09:58:50] <Clex> Indeed, you don't need jQuery to do that.
[10:03:48] <otherr> Clex : thanks
[10:07:46] <otherr> Clex : this is the third message Ive tried and Im still getting a 500 internal server error.
[10:08:15] <otherr> Clex : could I link you my scripts you could maybe check them out for obvious errors?
[10:08:18] <otherr> Clex : method*
[10:08:38] <Clex> otherr: JavaScript is executed on the client side.
[10:09:24] <otherr> Clex : thats why I am sending data to script to retrieve data from mysql table and bring it back to javascript?  What do you mean?
[10:10:17] <otherr> Clex : Ive read that before and what it means but not in relation to this 500 interal server error.
[10:10:22] <Clex> I mean bad JavaScript cannot make a 500 error. This error comes from your server.
[10:13:33] <otherr> Ok that is good information thank you.  Do you have any idea how my server could be doing that?  I have two other post scripts that work fine.
[10:15:02] <Clex> The post script called is likely failing for some reason. Can you read the logs or something?
[10:18:05] <otherr> Oh I havent tried console.log but the first time I tired it didnt work.  I am using firebug.
[10:19:08] <Clex> No. Logs on server side.
[10:19:20] <Clex> This has nothing to do with your browser.
[10:28:38] <otherr> Clex : where can I check them?  I will search for apache javascript logs?
[10:33:54] <otherr> Clex : wow in my shear stupidity I worked for 3 hours last night without realizing i was using javascript notation  in my php file.  You were absolutely correct in check apache error logs!  I pointed me right to the variable!
[10:45:49] <ph1> Hi guys how can I check the $this->Auth->login() for true or false with jquery? Basically I have a login modal, and when the submit (login) button is clicked I want to interrupt the click, check that the Auth was successful, if yes then proceed with the submit, if not then refresh the modal window so the flash messages can be displayed inside my modal window.
[11:16:35] <ph1> anyone around?
[11:36:55] <lilltiger> Hi, I am using jquery-ui spinners, and is there any way to change the value of the spinner without trigger a "change" event?
[12:43:19] <gordian> guys i'm using the google maps v3 api with several markers on the map. each marker has a click event listener and triggers some jQuery when the marker is clicked. what i want is to have a list, just a simple <UL> below the map (outside the map canvas) and be able to click an LI which will trigger a click on a corresponding marker. i've seen this answer but not really clear on how i can use it:

[13:56:28] <oniMaker> What's the correct way to use $.when with $.post ?
[13:56:57] <oniMaker> setting foo = $.post( ... ), then calling $.when(foo, function) but it doesn't execute
[13:57:03] <oniMaker> though the post does work
[13:58:19] <oniMaker> oh, when expects then chained
[14:34:18] <otherr> Hi I have a question how do I process an array in jquery to a javascript variable I get from ajax?
[14:35:32] <oniMaker> otherr: can you be more specific?
[14:36:02] <otherr> I echo back some data from a php script using ajax.  I want to turn that data into a javascript variable.
[14:38:37] <oniMaker> otherr: are you using json_encode in php?
[14:39:18] <otherr> Yes I am.  And I cant figure out how to get the elements of the array.  And when I alert the data it just says 'Array'
[14:39:33] <oniMaker> are you using JSON.parse on the javascript side?
[14:39:38] <shoky> oniMaker: $.when(foo).then(function(data) { ... })
[14:39:47] <oniMaker> shoky: yup, got it, thank you :)
[14:40:00] <otherr> No let me look that up.  Do you have any tips?
[14:40:25] <oniMaker> otherr: it's just a string until you run it through JSON.parse to turn it into a js object
[14:40:47] <otherr> Oh okay.  Then how do I access the elements of the array?
[14:40:58] <oniMaker> console.log it and find out :)
[14:41:21] <oniMaker> you could loop them with a $.each()
[14:41:25] <oniMaker> or access them by index
[14:41:27] <shoky> $.ajax will parse it for you already if it has a json content type
[14:41:45] <shoky> and since it said Array when you alerted it, it's probably already parsed
[14:42:11] <oniMaker> nicer to console.log
[14:42:22] <oniMaker> alert is irritating and uninformative
[14:42:34] <otherr> IT WORKEd
[14:42:36] <otherr> IT WORKED
[14:42:39] <otherr> thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!
[14:42:45] <oniMaker> It's a miracle!
[14:43:27] <lilltiger> Hi, I am using jquery-ui spinners, and is there any way to change the value of the spinner without trigger a "change" event?
[14:44:26] <oniMaker> lilltiger: does $( ".selector" ).spinner( "value", 50 ); trigger the change event?
[14:45:07] <__joshua__> unlikely
[14:45:28] <__joshua__> i would add .trigger('change') to the end of it
[14:45:32] <__joshua__> if you need it
[14:45:41] <lilltiger> It does trigger it
[14:45:56] <__joshua__> huh
[14:46:13] <lilltiger> wich is the problem :/
[14:46:23] <oniMaker> you could set a temp variable or property on the element, read it in the change handler, and abort if it's present
[14:46:28] <oniMaker> making sure to reset it in the change handler each time as well
[14:47:38] <lilltiger> did not know one could do that
[14:47:39] <shoky> .spinner('value', 50)  isn't triggering any change event for me

[14:48:01] <oniMaker> lilltiger: it's code, you can make it do anything
[14:48:17] <lilltiger> true
[14:48:28] <oniMaker> shoky: the change event doesn't fire on a normal change either
[14:48:44] <shoky> sure it does?
[14:49:09] <oniMaker> doesn't for me
[14:49:12] <__joshua__> it shouldn't fire a change event, that would make it different from most jqui widgets
[14:49:40] <shoky> oniMaker: you change the value and press enter and there is no console log, in that fiddle?
[14:50:15] <oniMaker> shoky: ah, only if I press enter
[14:50:23] <oniMaker> up/down and moving out of focus does nothing
[14:50:28] <shoky> yah that's when change is triggered
[14:50:31] <shoky> or on blur
[14:50:44] <oniMaker> up/down then blur doesn't trigger
[14:50:55] <oniMaker> I guess there's a spin handler for that?
[14:50:58] <shoky> right, that's jquery-ui changing it
[14:51:05] <shoky> same as .spinner('value',..)
[14:51:53] <lilltiger> hmm
[14:55:08] <lilltiger> How strange that it shouldent, as for me it does
[15:00:27] <lilltiger> where should I see the output in the fiddle?
[15:00:43] <lilltiger> ahh doh
[15:01:55] <lilltiger> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/Yk7Qe/ check that now
[15:02:20] <lilltiger> the change is trigged on the value change
[15:02:59] <otherr> oniMooker : my one last question.  I can get the data of the passed array.  But it seems functions outside the ajax function cant use the new data.  How do I do this?
[15:04:23] <shoky> lilltiger: ok that's jquery-ui's own change event, it's meant to be fired when jquery-ui changes the value...
[15:06:14] <lilltiger> shoky: ok, so it does work as intended then i guess, and itäs the reason to why it updates
[15:06:38] <shoky> lilltiger: if you don't want to trigger even that one... you can just change the input's value.  e.g.  spinner.val(100)
[15:08:12] <lilltiger> shoky: thanks, that was just what I wanted and needed, works just as I want
[15:37:57] <alexW_> can someone please refer me to the most user friendly jquery encryption plug in?
[15:39:25] <alexW_> or javascript package?
[15:52:48] <onenine90> Hey guys. I'm looking for some code that would make it easier to achieve the following in JavaScript/jQuery: Type in a textbox, wait a second or two, and call a function (only once, not for every keyup).
[15:53:54] <monk3y> onenine90: the Google query you want is something about "jquery debounce", but the first link that looks like what you want is; http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[15:56:02] <onenine90> Thank you monk3y this is perfect
[16:54:32] <tandroid> Hey guys, I want to add a class to an element if the scrollTop position is within a certain range. The way I'm doing it seems very inefficient. Is there a better way? http://jsbin.com/qefut/5/edit?js,console,output
[16:55:55] <waspinator> I'm trying to make a dynamic list, that can be added to or removed from with some animations. any ideas why I can't remove new items?
[16:55:56] <waspinator> http://jsfiddle.net/waspinator/nZ9y2/1/
[16:56:05] <BillCriswell> tandroid: This is fine, you could cache $(window) so you don't have to call it over and over again.
[16:56:38] <tandroid> BillCriswell, should I be checking if the element has that class already though?
[16:57:49] <shoky> waspinator: you need to use event delegation with .on()  http://jsfiddle.net/nZ9y2/2/
[16:58:49] <BillCriswell> tandroid: jQuery won't (can't) add the same class to the element multiple times so it's not needed.
[16:58:50] <shoky> tandroid: no, don't check
[16:59:24] <waspinator> shoky, thanks!
[16:59:47] <BillCriswell> tandroid: You may want to use toggleClass, since I'm sure you want to take it off when it's out of range?
[17:00:17] <tandroid> BillCriswell, alright I'll try that thanks
[17:01:13] <BillCriswell> tandroid: http://jsbin.com/muredeqi/1/edit?html,css,js,output is how I've approached something similar.
[17:03:32] <tandroid> Oh nice, I didn't know you could do that with toggleClass
[17:04:40] <BillCriswell> tandroid: Yes, it's helpful.
[17:24:11] <guy> Anyone can recommend a syntax highlighter?
[17:26:05] <dkog> If I add .focus(function) handler, is it additive, or it replaces previous chain?
[17:26:17] <dkog> and is there a better way in jQuery to manage these handlers?
[17:34:34] <shoky> dkog: it's additive
[17:40:42] <dkog> ok thanks
[19:56:09] <technosexual> I need some super awesome form validation, any suggestions?
[19:58:26] <technosexual> I'm trying https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation
[19:58:34] <technosexual> but I don't think I'm using it right.
[19:58:45] <technosexual> ah, yes, I'm not.
[20:19:55] <teitoklein01> can you bind a .click event to a .data attribute? e.g. $($('div').data('record-id')).click(function(){});
[20:21:05] <teitoklein01> i'm just curious if I should still create an 'id' identifier to detect the click event for each cell or maybe I could just use my data-record-id to detect the event
[20:21:33] <jphase> teitoklein01: you can select a data attribute in the selector $('div[data-record-id]').on('click', function() {
[20:22:17] <teitoklein01> oh that's it! Thanks. i'll try it. (y)
[20:23:44] <momo_cassandra> hi guys!
[20:24:25] <momo_cassandra> ???
[20:26:32] <momo_cassandra> do you guys know any library/plugin I can use to escape special characters or transliterate characters?
[20:27:39] <jphase> regex :)
[20:28:10] <momo_cassandra> well, I have this
[20:28:11] <momo_cassandra> str.replace(/([;&,\.\+\*\~':"\!\^#$%@\[\]\(\)=>\|])/g, '\\$1')
[20:28:31] <momo_cassandra> but just wondering if there's an available plugin or library to help me do the job
[20:35:04] <momo_cassandra> thanks for the answer @jphase :)
[20:35:27] <marky-b> I'm attempting to merge two objects (modifying the first), but I am getting pseudo-duplicate keys due to case sensitivity. Is there a way to merge javascript object members
[20:35:52] <jphase> heh, wasn't very specific momo_cassandra but sure thing. I wouldn't think a library would offer something that's specific to your needs is all so I tend to use custom regex for that ;)
[20:35:53] <systemfault> Wellâ€¦ case-sensitivity matters.
[20:36:10] <marky-b> that may be either camel-cased or all lower?
[20:36:29] <systemfault> marky-b: Thatâ€™s the real problem, canâ€™t you have consistency in your project?
[20:37:17] <systemfault> marky-b: The easy fix would be to create an entirely new objectâ€¦ and merge the two objects one after the otherâ€¦ lowercasing the keys
[20:37:23] <marky-b> unfortunately, what i'm getting back is from a 3rd party api, and i have noticed on 3 separate occasions that their json members have gone from camel to lower and back
[20:38:24] <marky-b> systemfault: that is what I will probably end up having to do here, but I was hoping a quick question in irc could save me some time searching for a case flag in .extend.
[20:38:57] <systemfault> marky-b: Your code is the problem hereâ€¦ if your code is bad, you need a hack.
[20:39:25] <marky-b> it's not a hack if it was built in ;]
[20:39:33] <marky-b> the inconsistant api is a major annoyance.
[20:39:55] <marky-b> thanks for the input. The answer was what I had expected :/
[20:45:20] <fattest> how do i remove all the points available, return points, all that stuff in the header, remove the design and the code? http://jsfiddle.net/8yh79/
[23:01:21] <nights> does google index pages that only load with js?
[23:01:36] <nights> (yes, i know a page should have non-js support ideally)
[23:13:47] <ronny> hi
[23:14:34] <ronny> anyone aware of a simple jquery plugin for templationg, doesnt have to do more than filling in some data and loops
[23:27:01] <fattest> How do I make the ranks for my individual items, set, on page load? http://jsfiddle.net/8yh79/3/
[23:27:22] <fattest> I don't want to click on an item to improve its rank, i  want to do it on page load
