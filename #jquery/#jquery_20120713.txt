[00:06:53] <jonkersjoe> is there a way for jqueryUi.accordion to be triggered where it doesn't automatically open the first panel ?
[00:09:30] <Whirl3d_> activate(n)
[00:10:08] <Whirl3d_> if collapsible is set to true, you can pass false and it' won't open
[00:10:32] <jonkersjoe> ahhh crap, yes thanks. should have seen that.
[00:10:34] <Whirl3d_> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/  under activate in methods
[00:22:51] <Whirl3d_> how would I get a list of scalar measurable properties for an element? In other words, things like display or not scalar, but "top" is...
[00:24:22] <jonkersjoe> just another question, there's no way of dynamically adding pnales to an accordion without distroying and recreating the accordion ? I'm having to load things dynamically but I think the whole process is running a little slow… there's a noticeable lag.
[00:25:07] <jonkersjoe> actually it might be my computer… need a restart…
[00:26:40] <Whirl3d_> I was just looking through the api and didn't see anything one way or the other. It should be easy to destroy and rebuild though. I just wonder if there isn't a better way?
[00:28:32] <Whirl3d_> If you have an array of values, how do you get the largest value in the array?
[00:28:46] <Whirl3d_> do you just have to cycle through them all?
[00:31:05] <systemfault> Whirl3d_:
[00:31:41] <systemfault> ?js Math.max.apply(null, [1,2,4,6,3,12,4,6]);
[00:31:43] <bot-t> systemfault: SyntaxError: illegal character
[00:31:54] <systemfault> Anyway.. it's like that :/
[00:32:19] <Whirl3d_> sry, Math.max
[00:32:28] <Whirl3d_> can I pass an array
[00:32:31] <Whirl3d_> obviosuly
[00:32:34] <systemfault> :/
[00:32:35] <systemfault> S
[00:32:47] <systemfault> My snippet works in practice...
[00:33:00] <systemfault> ?js Math.max.apply(null, [1,2,4,6,3,12,4,6]);
[00:33:00] <bot-t> systemfault: 12
[00:33:42] <Whirl3d_> I am trying to write a simple plugin to handle maxProp where you pass a property to a collection and get the item with the max prop value
[00:34:32] <Whirl3d_> of course, I'll also write the extension to that for maxVal(prop)....i'm almost done with them.
[00:34:56] <systemfault> You're writing some kind of library?
[00:35:12] <Whirl3d_> just some simple functions I keep writing over and over
[00:35:40] <Whirl3d_> like max and min based on property values and an expanded dimensions object
[00:36:19] <Whirl3d_> that lists top, right, left, bottom, centerx, centery (for both position and offset) and width and height all in one object
[00:36:39] <systemfault> I see
[00:37:04] <Whirl3d_> but in doing so, I want to pass a collection and the dims on the collection will require the min and max values for those props in the collection
[00:38:25] <Whirl3d_> but in my maxProp function, I am struggling with determining when the value is from css, attr, or dims
[00:39:05] <Whirl3d_> and I suppose I should allow for a custom data field if the value fails on all of those.
[00:40:05] <Whirl3d_> which now makes me think there should be a .propVal method for all jquery objects that gives the damn property value regardless of whether it's css , attr, data, or dims...
[00:41:55] <systemfault> They did something similar with .attr...
[00:42:05] <systemfault> But it sucked so they added .prop
[00:42:51] <Whirl3d_> I'm just doing: var val=elem.attr(prop)||elem.css(prop)||elem.dims(prop)||elem.data(prop);
[00:43:26] <Whirl3d_> don't know how effective it will be
[00:43:47] <systemfault> I personally hate functions that tries to be too clever.
[00:43:56] <systemfault> I hate .data for that same reason
[00:44:20] <Whirl3d_> hmmm. Why is that? .data is just a common storage spot. why is that bad?
[00:44:31] <systemfault> Because of the magic it does...
[00:44:51] <Whirl3d_> I'm frightfully unaware of any magic that it does.. do share...
[00:44:54] <systemfault> If you have an attribute that contains json, .data will implicitely parse it
[00:45:21] <jonkersjoe> nope still slow… anyone know if you can dynamically add pannels to jqueryUi accordion ? without destroying it and enabling it ?
[00:45:22] <Whirl3d_> that's not much magic...kinda common sense right. It doesn't do it backwards though
[00:45:49] <Whirl3d_> data isn't automatically parsed back to data-prefixed attributes at least.
[00:45:54] <Whirl3d_> that would be magix. LOL
[00:46:07] <systemfault> :)
[00:46:19] <Whirl3d_> I hear what you are saying.
[00:46:40] <Whirl3d_> But I never trust it anyways...I always pull from the attr if i need it.
[00:47:02] <Whirl3d_> especially cause I am not sure if the data changes, does the data-prefixed attr change?
[00:47:22] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/QGT67/ :P
[00:47:41] <Whirl3d_> and what happens when your data variable is the same as an attribute .....now I am starting to hate it too...
[00:47:47] <systemfault> No, it's a one-time parsing
[00:48:09] <systemfault> AFAIK
[00:49:31] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/QGT67/2/
[00:49:38] <Whirl3d_> one time shot. That sux
[00:50:01] <Whirl3d_> or maybe it doesn't suck. It's a nice way to keep your original values....
[00:51:13] <Whirl3d_> yeah they need to make it a method that parses the attribute to the data. So you have to intentionally do it. Otherwise it's too inconsistent
[00:57:23] <chot> hi
[00:57:34] <Whirl3d_> hello
[00:57:46] <chot> is it possible to trigger a drag on a sortable? (can't find anything on the web)
[00:58:10] <Whirl3d_> seriously? did you look at jquery UI?
[00:58:14] <Whirl3d_> draggables?
[00:58:18] <chot> what I'm doing is inserting a new item and I want it to "start" as dragging so that the user can place it in the correct place
[00:58:34] <Whirl3d_> now that's a different question.
[00:58:36] <Whirl3d_> lol
[00:58:43] <chot> Whirl3d_: hehe
[00:59:09] <Whirl3d_> the problem is that the drag event is handled by the mouse...so it would be inconsistent to start in drag position if the mouse wasn't down
[00:59:49] <Whirl3d_> You might be able to stylize it to look like it's actively dragging.
[00:59:51] <chot> well, it is down actually
[01:00:07] <chot> I've tried triggering it by newItem.mousedown()
[01:00:22] <chot> but it doesn't work :/
[01:00:31] <Whirl3d_> try trigger("mousedown");
[01:00:38] <chot> tried that as well
[01:00:56] <Whirl3d_> is there a drag method?
[01:01:19] <chot> not that I've found, I tried different combinations of newItem.startDrag() etc
[01:01:42] <chot> and from what I can tell I can't find anything like that in the source code
[01:01:59] <Whirl3d_> try .trigger(dragstart)
[01:02:49] <chot> doesn't work :(
[01:02:56] <Whirl3d_> but you have to have a start callback defined to do that, I think
[01:03:32] * Cork pokes freenode
[01:03:46] <Whirl3d_> $("newbutton").draggable( {start:function (event,ui) {stuff});   $(newbutton).trigger("dragstart")  maybe?
[01:04:51] <chot> hm ok I'll try, but what should "stuff" be? :P
[01:05:09] <Whirl3d_> I don't know....maybe we're approaching this wrong.
[01:05:10] <Cork> the event listner and the callback doesn't have anything to do with each other
[01:05:34] <Whirl3d_> we were grasping at straws.
[01:05:42] <Cork> whats the problem?
[01:05:52] <Whirl3d_> triggering a dragstart manually
[01:06:01] <chot> Cork: I want to programmatically trigger a drag on an item I'm inserting into a sortable
[01:06:09] <Cork> the callback or just an event loop?
[01:06:26] <chot> hm no basically I want to do: newItem.startDrag();
[01:06:39] <Whirl3d_> so it's dragging...
[01:06:57] <Cork> that'll be tricky
[01:07:15] <Cork> it uses the menu widget to get mouse events to start with
[01:07:27] <Cork> so you would prob have to fake the mouse events it expects
[01:08:20] <chot> hm yeah I've tried different combinations of .mousedown() and .trigger("mousedown"), .trigger("mousedown.sortable") etc. but none that I've tried so far have worked
[01:08:27] <Whirl3d_> chot, you should suggest that as an update option. I can see several uses for it.
[01:08:28] <Cork> won't work
[01:08:45] <Whirl3d_> how does the menu widget get it's mouse events
[01:10:36] <chot> Whirl3d_: yepp I'll post a feature request
[01:10:52] <Cork> simplest is prob to extend draggable so you can fake the _mouseStart handler
[01:11:26] <chot> Cork: hm ok, I'll give it a go
[01:11:51] <Cork> alternatively you might be able to do something like...
[01:12:38] <Cork> bah no that won't work
[01:13:07] <Cork> so no extending is prob the only way
[01:13:13] <chot> hm ok
[01:13:38] <Cork> hmm
[01:14:00] <mdunham918_> hey guys I'm building a file manager here: http://72.205.239.14:1337/prognosis/filemanager/?user_id=1337&patient_id=1 I want to build a plugin that will create an effect so that when you click on a Folder I want the files that are with in it to shoot out from the folder like the folder explodes basically
[01:14:08] <Cork> bah, give this a go $(target).trigger('mousedown')
[01:14:13] <Cork> chot: ^
[01:14:28] <mdunham918_> something like http://razorjack.net/quicksand/ but from the center of the folder icon out
[01:14:30] <Cork> its not very likely that it will work, but it has a slight chance
[01:16:05] <chot> Cork: yeah I've tried that but doesn't work :/
[01:16:23] <Cork> ya, that goes through all the capture checks
[01:16:30] <Cork> and prob fails at them
[01:17:15] <NodeX> anyone have an idea on how much ubiquity HTML5 has ?
[01:18:03] <Cork> NodeX: depends
[01:18:43] <Cork> html5 is mainly a standardization of error corrections and its almost uniform
[01:19:03] <Cork> the new html tags is easy to get uniform
[01:19:18] <Cork> video, audio, canvas is tricker
[01:19:28] <Cork> input validation is... no
[01:19:42] <NodeX> err, I meant the uptake of it
[01:19:48] <bjensen12> I have a counter I need to update based on the number of rows in a table..how can I keep track of the number of trs? RIght now I have a $("table.users").find("tr").count, but I need it to be executed when a tr is added...
[01:19:53] <Cork> NodeX: thats just it
[01:19:57] <Cork> html5 isn't one thing
[01:19:58] <NodeX> like how much percent of the world runs on html5 currently
[01:20:09] <Cork> ah, you mean on server side
[01:20:23] <Cork> no clue
[01:20:35] <NodeX> example flash has 95% ubiquity
[01:20:42] <Cork> but i would guess at quite low
[01:20:46] <NodeX> dang
[01:20:57] <Cork> (and that is the <!doctype html> pressence in html pages)
[01:21:19] * NodeX checks analytics to see if it can tell me
[01:21:20] <Cork> but thats going to take years, as most older pages won't ever be updated
[01:21:30] <NodeX> I dont care for everyone else
[01:21:48] <Cork> NodeX: then you need to specify what your talking about
[01:21:56] <Cork> the client support i answered first
[01:21:59] <NodeX> I care on how many people can use html5 on my pages - i/e what rough percentage of the world has a html5 compatible browser
[01:22:15] <Cork> and that depends on what tag not "html5"
[01:22:27] <NodeX> <!doctype html>
[01:22:32] <Cork> html5 is the last standerd theres going to be of html
[01:22:44] <Cork> its rolling release now days
[01:22:45] <Anticom> hi all
[01:22:57] <NodeX> ok, I'll rephrase
[01:23:03] <Whirl3d_> Anticom, hello
[01:23:09] <Zhy> are there any known issues with .tagName ? I use it on form fields to determine whether they're textareas or inputs but sometimes it's undefined (although in another function that's being executed before the same object had the tagname defined)
[01:23:11] <Anticom> hey Whirl3d_ (:
[01:23:15] <NodeX> browsers that can read "data-*" attributes
[01:23:18] <Cork> NodeX: and except for video, audio, canvas and input validation the reset has no new features
[01:23:27] <Cork> NodeX: 100% for the last 10 years
[01:23:29] <NodeX> I dont care about the features
[01:23:35] <NodeX> thanks
[01:23:38] <Anticom> somehow $('#myform').submit() submits the form using get but not post. is there any way to solve that?
[01:24:06] <Cork> NodeX: html5 just put the namespace as reserved, it demanded nothing from browsers
[01:24:09] <Whirl3d_> ? ajaxform
[01:24:09] <bot-t> ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. - http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#download
[01:24:10] <systemfault> Anticom: add method="POST" on the form?
[01:24:34] <Anticom> DOH
[01:24:50] <Anticom> you know that awesome moment, when you could shoot yourself to the moon?
[01:24:54] <Anticom> ...i just had it
[01:25:21] <Whirl3d_> systemfault, I love that you think of those things every time. I'm always working out some custom bullshit that never works. LOL
[01:25:37] <Anticom> haha
[01:25:43] <Anticom> um... but still it seems to be ajax
[01:26:02] <Anticom> as some might remember, i wanted native form submission triggered by js
[01:26:03] <Anticom> :/
[01:26:42] <Whirl3d_> sounds an awful lot like I heard #javascript calling for you. LOL
[01:27:50] <systemfault> Anticom: If you use ajax, set the "type" to post
[01:28:04] <Anticom> no i just don't want to use ajax on this =D
[01:28:28] <Cork> .submit() just trigger the submit event on the form
[01:28:35] <systemfault> Whirl3d_:  :P
[01:28:37] <Anticom> well, the idea is, that the user get's a promt by clicking the submit button, where he has to click "OK" before the form is finally sent
[01:28:41] <Cork> its method value is how its sent
[01:28:52] <Cork> Anticom: just liek systemfault said before
[01:29:21] <Cork> <systemfault> Anticom: add method="POST" on the form? <-- thats your solution
[01:29:24] <Anticom> yeah, but the browser isn't changing location after that to the sent script
[01:29:39] <Anticom> Cork get/post isn't a problem anymore
[01:29:51] <Anticom> it's that jq seems to use ajax to fool me :/
[01:29:59] <Cork> does the server send a redirect?
[01:30:26] <Cork> it doesn't unless you have bound a event listner and stops the native submit
[01:30:36] <Cork> (and does the ajax call your self)
[01:30:37] <Anticom> no i got "<form method="post" action="pdf.php" id="form-kfz">" which in theory should redirect it to pdf.php where i have the data posted available to work with
[01:30:47] <Cork> yes
[01:30:59] <Cork> Anticom: your using jquery mobile or something like that?
[01:31:04] <Anticom> noooooooo
[01:31:14] <Anticom> why are you making it so complicated Cork ?! :D
[01:31:28] <Cork> cause what you explain doesn't happen normally
[01:31:30] <Anticom> i got a form, a click handler preventing the default event and showing up the dialog
[01:31:45] <Anticom> let me fiddle for a moment
[01:31:51] <Cork> jquery doesn't magically make anything an ajax call
[01:33:10] <Anticom> we
[01:33:14] <Anticom> we'll see*
[01:35:29] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/KP7ee/
[01:36:20] <Anticom> tbh i can't see google loading
[01:37:38] <systemfault> Well… trying to POST to google… what do you expect?
[01:37:47] <Cork> why are you binding a click listner on the form??
[01:38:34] <Cork> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/KP7ee/1/
[01:39:42] <xec> Cork: that click event was preventing the default submit button
[01:39:56] <Anticom> because now it won't hold the submit button click event... still i do have to admin, i'd have to bind it on the submit button... like so: http://jsfiddle.net/KP7ee/2/
[01:40:01] <Anticom> and again someone was faster than me
[01:40:09] <Anticom> hey xec
[01:40:14] * xec waves
[01:40:23] * Anticom waves back
[01:40:33] <xec> it would make more sense to put the click listener on the submit button rather than the form though
[01:40:57] <Anticom> that's what i admitted and corrected in my most recent link
[01:41:15] <xec> right. you were quicker than me!
[01:41:16] <xec> :D
[01:41:21] <Anticom> haha
[01:41:42] <Anticom> however... i can't find any way to suppress any ajax stuff happening
[01:41:57] <xec> there's no ajax stuff going on in that demo?
[01:42:07] <Cork> xec: i know, thats why i disabled it
[01:42:11] <Anticom> besides i got no clue, why google's throing a 405 on my request :/
[01:42:24] <Anticom> xec is there not?! :O
[01:42:38] <Anticom> is there any test-site dumping get/post data?
[01:42:47] <Cork> jsfiddle
[01:42:48] <xec> Anticom: do you have firebug?
[01:42:54] <Anticom> xec sure thing
[01:43:00] <xec> Anticom: use the net tap
[01:43:02] <xec> tab*
[01:43:04] <Cork> tick persistent then
[01:43:08] <systemfault> Anticom: What would google do with your post request?
[01:43:14] <Anticom> xec that's what i have been doing
[01:43:22] <Anticom> but i can't determin wether it's ajax or not, can i?
[01:43:36] <Anticom> systemfault being awesome, as always?!
[01:43:37] <Anticom> :D
[01:43:55] <xec> Anticom: well, it's not under XHR is it
[01:44:04] <Anticom> oh i see
[01:44:09] <systemfault> Anticom: If it was XHR, you would know.
[01:44:21] <Anticom> completley forgott about those tabs/filters
[01:44:47] <Anticom> okay so let me see in my app
[01:45:21] <Anticom> grrrarghhh FUUUUUUUUU
[01:45:34] <Anticom> why is this bloody thing posting it using ajax in my app >_>
[01:45:42] <Anticom> sec, i'll dump the whole js stuff
[01:47:03] <Anticom> http://pastebin.com/vsdCCDyL there you go
[01:47:19] <Anticom> OH NOES... forget about it
[01:47:26] <Anticom> i experimentaly used .post method
[01:47:30] <systemfault> Heh...
[01:47:32] <Anticom> because submit() gave me get
[01:47:33] <Anticom> hahaha
[01:47:37] <Anticom> i'm feeling so dumb
[01:48:07] * xec pats Anticom on the back
[01:48:09] <xec> there there
[01:48:22] <Anticom> works just fine now :>

[02:05:13] <Lost123> how can i wrapn an 'a' element to an image which has the property display block.
[02:06:07] <Cork> wrap element to?
[02:06:15] <Anticom> Lost123 you mean when clicking on the image the browser followes a link?
[02:06:18] <Cork> you want to wrap an a tag around or convert it?
[02:07:27] <coldhead> Lost123: http://jsfiddle.net/u22qn/
[02:08:30] <Anticom> solution approved :D
[02:08:33] <Cork> i think he might be thinking about the line breaking effect of block elements
[02:09:08] <coldhead> Cork: you are a master of reading between the lines
[02:09:15] <coldhead> and around the line breaking effects
[02:09:20] <coldhead> kudos
[02:09:34] <Cork> not really
[02:09:40] <coldhead> NO, REALLY
[02:09:46] <Cork> i'm still waiting for a readable question
[02:10:04] <Cork> but that he points at display: block, make me thing its not only about .wrap()
[02:11:21] <Anticom> maybe it's time for a short introduction to how to ask questions: http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:11:28] <coldhead> i just heard what i wanted to hear

[03:29:54] <quicksilver> which is like an array of DOM objects, but it has lots of cool methods on it.
[03:30:00] <Cristen> ok
[03:30:04] <quicksilver> $('foo')[0] is a DOM object, plain and simple.
[03:31:18] <quicksilver> some limited information at http://docs.jquery.com/Types#jQuery
[03:33:51] <Cristen> thx a lot quicksilver really usefull :)
[03:38:59] <shwaiil> hi
[03:39:37] <quicksilver> Cristen: yw
[03:41:38] <timing> GUYS! How do we get rid of opera mini? It fuck's up all my websites.
[03:42:27] <shwaiil> Q: I've got a Drag Element that happens on .mousedown. This doesnt work for iPad, how to fix it ? $('.drag').mousedown(function(e){ ... }
[03:45:13] <angelete2> hi
[03:45:47] <angelete2> i'm looking for a plugin to get an effect similar to google maps
[03:46:21] <angelete2> i have a very big image and i can zoom on it, and some tiles are being visible in the next zoom level
[03:53:08] <michelem> hello folks
[03:53:43] <michelem> if a function modifies the DOM, will new information be available immediately or only at the end of the function?
[03:55:18] <michelem> I collapse some elements (FAQs) in a function, and then .scrollTo() the new top of the selected element, but this always brings far under the position of the element
[03:55:58] <io__> hi i am looking for a way to zoom with the scrollwheel, i was having a look at $(window).scroll(function () but that only works if the windows is actually scrolled whhile i need to trigger the event at mouse scroll wheel
[04:00:29] <io__> ok this seems to be it : .bind('DOMMouseScroll', function(e)
[04:14:44] <michelem> what is the execution model of a jquery function? are the DOM properties computed after each call or only at the end of the js function?
[04:17:28] <quicksilver> computed? what does that question mean, michelem?
[04:17:37] <quicksilver> jquery doesn't change the execution model of javascript.
[04:17:58] <quicksilver> $('foo').prop('bar','baz') takes effect immediately
[04:19:15] <michelem> I am just confused by this example. After I .slideUp() some elements, the .offset().top of them is BIGGER than before, and if I check the offsetTop property from the browser at the end of the whole function, it's significantly smaller.
[04:20:04] <michelem> so there must be something about the context or time of commit of the function. That behavior is from a callback to $(document).ready()
[04:23:30] <michelem> here's a live example: http://webdev2.buddyns.com/faq/#limits
[04:23:36] <quicksilver> michelem: slideUp() is an animation.
[04:23:54] <quicksilver> michelem: animations take time to complete and are asynchronous w.r.t the funciton they're called in.
[04:23:57] <quicksilver> that's why they have callbacks.
[04:23:58] <michelem> so it's deferred?
[04:24:10] <quicksilver> well I wouldn't say it's deferred per se
[04:24:18] <quicksilver> I'd say it proceeds over a period of time
[04:24:20] <michelem> I didn't know they run asynchronously. Makes sense.
[04:24:22] <quicksilver> it is an animation after all
[04:24:31] <michelem> thanks, I'll look into that.
[04:24:44] <quicksilver> if animations weren't run asynchronously they'd block the browser while running
[04:24:48] <quicksilver> which would be quite annoying for the user
[04:24:50] <michelem> y
[04:24:57] <Anticom> michelem whatever you do... juts don't use alert for debugging, use console.log() ;)
[04:25:05] <Anticom> just*
[04:26:27] <michelem> Anticom: thx
[04:26:46] <michelem> I've seen js code with ";" and without. What's the current best practice?
[04:26:48] <Anticom> michelem what browser are you using?
[04:26:57] <Anticom> always with :)
[04:27:43] <michelem> Anticom: opera
[04:28:14] <Anticom> http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite/
[04:28:58] <Anticom> oh and michelem: although it's offtopic somehow, you could use some js lint systems like http://www.jslint.com/ or http://www.jshint.com/ which will tell you best practices
[04:29:01] <michelem> Anticom: I do use firebug when I can't avoid opening Fireelephant
[04:29:34] <Anticom> okay... there's a console tab
[04:29:48] <Anticom> whenever you use console.log(), stuff is going to be logged there
[04:29:56] <michelem> Anticom: thanks much. I am not a real js developer btw, just patching some code
[04:30:14] <Anticom> yea but this is essential :P
[04:31:53] <michelem> to get the gist, how would you write "if a hash was specified in the URI" ?
[04:32:26] <michelem> I saw "if (location.hash)" works, wondering if there's more elegant ways.
[04:36:13] <Anticom> this probably is the most elegant way
[04:47:47] <arcanine> what are the acceptable parameters for the on() function? I'm trying to replace live() using the same parameters but it does not trigger
[04:48:27] <arcanine> how do I define the second parameter, (selector)?
[04:56:53] <phr> guys, since i've made an external link to my .js file, my function doesn't work anymore. what should i replace? it's starting with.. $(document).ready(function()
[04:58:43] <MINTTU> doublecheck if the external link is alive.
[04:58:43] <michelem> Anticom: may be the most elegant way, but "if (! location.hash)" crashes Opera :P
[04:58:57] <phr> MINTTU it is.
[05:00:00] <MINTTU> phr: do a alert("jquery alive"); after document ready
[05:01:30] <phr> it is alive :)
[05:01:39] <phr> dialog also popsup
[05:01:56] <phr> oh! i got it
[05:02:02] <phr> thanks:)
[05:02:02] <MINTTU> inside js script
[05:02:13] <phr> inside the js script, yes
[05:02:50] <phr> i've created a new function with all the functions and initialized it. now it works:)
[05:03:45] <phr> MINTTU thanks for your help dude. i'm out;)
[05:04:09] <MINTTU> well, you did the work mate. np
[05:04:13] <Anticom> michelem do console.log(location) to verify the object is accessible
[05:04:40] <Anticom> and furthermore you should change to #javascript since this is not a jq specific problem anymore by far michelem
[05:05:17] <Anticom> is there any way to somehow automatically compose an object containing all data from a form similar to .submit() without well... submitting it?
[05:05:54] <Anticom> something like <pseudocode> myObject = $('form').getFormData() </pseudocode>
[05:17:09] <noregret> http://pastie.org/4249588 why is the <tr> generated from putTable() don't fall into the </table></form> tags ?
[05:21:52] <MINTTU> noregret: its generated outside?
[05:22:15] <Anticom> noregret because you're not appending it to the form but to .keywords.index ?!
[05:22:19] <fillrobs> Hello people - I'm looking for a little help with jquery and datatables
[05:22:30] <Anticom> fillrobs go ahead
[05:22:33] <noregret> MINTTU: yeah, outside </table></form>
[05:22:57] <fillrobs> thanks - I've been through the tutorials but struggling to merge 2 functions together properly
[05:22:59] <noregret> Anticom: what
[05:23:17] <Anticom> "$('.keywords.index').append(putTable(val.Spam));"
[05:23:29] <noregret> yeah so ?
[05:23:41] <noregret> before that is the openening tag
[05:23:46] <noregret> and after it, the closing tags
[05:23:51] <Anticom> oh i see
[05:23:58] <MINTTU> its correct approach
[05:24:31] <noregret> yeah, got no clue why is it generated ourside the tags... the css isn't applied on them so they look pretty bad
[05:25:12] <fillrobs> am using server-side it draws the table ok - I've added the fnInitComplete function to allow clicking on the table to populate search - but it only works once
[05:25:37] <fillrobs> have to refresh page
[05:26:02] <fillrobs> can't see how to sit it outside of the document.ready function
[05:27:05] <Anticom2> re
[05:27:28] <Anticom2> noregret does the theader get inserted in the correct position?
[05:27:54] <noregret> Anticom2: yeah, headers are fine
[05:28:16] <Anticom2> if so i'd just continue to append to the theader var in the loop and append it at the verry end when you're all done
[05:28:41] <MINTTU> noregret: you've forgot to close the div
[05:28:47] <michelem> there's this beautiful practice of displaying pilcrows next to section titles, eg https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/db/models/#fields . Is there a jquery plugin to generate these automatically (eg, for all items with a "name" attribute) instead of by hand in html?
[05:28:49] <Anticom2> like "theader += putTable(...);"
[05:29:26] <noregret> MINTTU: what div ?
[05:30:00] <Anticom2> line 7 in paste noregret
[05:30:06] <Anticom2> oh it is
[05:30:08] <Anticom2> at the line end
[05:30:22] <MINTTU> nvm
[05:30:27] <noregret> :)
[05:30:55] <io__> hi is there a way to hide but to keep the element in existence, I am doing $element.fadeTo(0, 0.000001); now, but it seems more like a workaround
[05:31:58] <Anticom2> noregret try this http://pastie.org/4249660
[05:33:24] <fillrobs> Anticom - can you take a look at http://www.interiorsforme.com/admin/datatables/index.php for me and take a look at the script?
[05:34:14] <noregret> Anticom2: cool, it worked fine, but why ? whats the main diff in that ?
[05:34:30] <Anticom2> i've just appended the string to each other
[05:34:52] <Anticom2> i don't know exactly why your attempt failed, but sometimes you don't know why something fails but just how to fix it ;)
[05:35:07] <Anticom2> in my snipped the whole data is just appened once, as you can see
[05:35:09] <noregret> hehe cool :)
[05:35:14] <Anticom2> welcome :)
[05:35:46] <Anticom2> btw i solved the question i asked before myself: http://v3.javascriptmvc.com/docs/dom.html#&who=jQuery.fn.formParams maybe some of you might be interessted in this plugin
[05:37:38] <Anticom2> harr harr some guys realy did an MVC attempt on jquery... that sound's awesome!
[05:37:58] <fillrobs> MVC?
[05:38:17] <Anticom2> model, view, controller... it's a design pattern helping to organize your code in little bits
[05:38:44] <Anticom2> fillrobs you might want to take a look at "ext js" (http://sencha.com)
[05:39:04] <norbi> hi guys!
[05:39:06] * norbi waves
[05:39:20] <Rainb> Javascript is now r+ ?
[05:39:25] <norbi> is there any method to check if scroll bar appeared on window?
[05:39:34] <fillrobs> cool - thanks Anticom will check it out
[05:40:12] <norbi> i have some jquery fadeIn() and after some of them faded, scroll bar appears, and that messes up things
[05:40:41] <Rainb> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2913375/how-to-know-if-the-scrollbars-has-appeared-in-browser-jquery
[05:42:21] <norbi> Rainb: that looks non compatible with all the browsers
[05:42:37] <norbi> probably i will make it appear for all the time
[05:43:03] <norbi> with a looong looong div until i finish the animations
[05:43:09] <norbi> thank you for your help
[05:44:20] <Anticom2> norbi example script?
[05:44:44] <Anticom2> you might want to overwrite css rules to hide the overflowing content or wrap them arround of fancy stuff like that
[05:45:29] <norbi> Anticom2: the problem is overflow is needed
[05:45:37] <norbi> i cant hide them
[05:45:53] <norbi> so better prepare the container with the final hight
[05:46:15] <Anticom2> your container is high? :D
[05:46:16] <Anticom2> jk
[05:46:45] <Anticom2> norbi please code a little example in jsfiddle and then i'll see, what i can do
[05:50:25] <Anticom2> fillrobs oh i forgott a short explanation why this is good: have you ever wrote a big js-driven one-page webapp with hundrets and hundrets of lines of code? if so, and you used jquery you will agree, that it's an absolute MESS and that's why mvc is great... it forces you to split up your scripts into little parts which are responsible for their specific problem etc. and that makes it extremley maintainable
[05:51:05] <fillrobs> yeah - thing is it's like $500 and I may only do this one app
[05:51:21] <fillrobs> the jquery datatables looks great
[05:51:40] <fillrobs> just tricky to do (am ok with javascript - jquery a bit new to me)
[05:52:24] <fillrobs> thanks for your input though
[05:59:44] <Anticom2> what event is fired, when i choose something from a <select> list ?
[05:59:48] <Anticom2> <option> --> click?
[06:00:06] <Anticom2> or is there any way to bind the events to the select tag itself, or EVEN a more elegant way?
[06:01:08] <fillrobs> you talking to me Anticom?
[06:04:35] <Anticom2> fillrobs to you too; it was a question to the whole channel ;)
[06:04:45] <Anticom2> i don't know everything either :P
[06:04:57] <fillrobs> hehe
[06:05:37] <fillrobs> I only really know to give it an id and then use getElementByID('idname').value
[06:05:56] <fillrobs> but that is probably javascript not jquery ;o)
[06:08:42] <norbi> Anticom2: sry misstype
[06:08:44] <norbi> height
[06:08:51] <norbi> ill code an example now
[06:08:54] <Anticom2> norbi was just joking anyway
[06:09:42] * norbi had to run out for dog food, his huskies are howling badly
[06:09:57] <norbi> so never tried jsfiddle
[06:25:02] <cusco> hi
[06:25:33] <MINTTU> hi
[06:25:37] <DarsVaeda> did something change with .attr('id') in the last versions? I do not get a string back containing the id but an object containing the whole object
[06:25:46] <cusco> using .keyup(), how can I validate if event has only ascii ? I mean, I don't want to trigger ctrl, alt, shift etc
[06:25:54] <cusco> only when the user inputs stuff
[06:25:58] <DarsVaeda> jquery 1.7.2
[06:27:11] <NodeX> when one does $("foo").click(fn);
[06:27:27] <NodeX> is event automagically passed to the f
[06:27:28] <NodeX> fn *
[06:30:59] <Anticom2> somehow i can't select a certain element not by id (example: http://jsfiddle.net/U6kXx/1/)
[06:31:05] <Anticom2> i have no clue, what's going wrong
[06:31:46] <Anticom2> might this be a bug or something?
[06:32:51] <NodeX> your element does not exists
[06:32:54] <NodeX> exist*
[06:32:56] <DarsVaeda> it is "id=" not "name="
[06:32:58] <NodeX> name != id
[06:33:43] <Anticom2> it's those little obvious things...
[06:33:50] <cusco> http://jsfiddle.net/U6kXx/2/
[06:33:52] <cusco> lol
[06:34:20] <NodeX> Anticom2 : it always is !
[06:34:42] <Anticom2> NodeX jep :D
[06:34:59] <Anticom2> cusco thank's captain obvious :D
[06:35:05] <norbi> Anticom2: http://jsfiddle.net/XdafK/5/ here it is observe how the scroll bar is not present in the beging, then how it appears
[06:35:25] <Anticom2> norbi holy cow :D
[06:35:47] <Anticom2> norbi so what exactly is going wrong and what did you wanted it to be like?
[06:36:30] <norbi> in my case i have a full size image in background and its width doesnt change when scrollbar appears
[06:36:38] <norbi> so it breaks me some positioning
[06:36:55] <norbi> look, i will show u
[06:39:09] <cusco> I'm still looking for a way to validate using .keyup() if the key pressed is a ascii char
[06:39:26] <cusco> I would like not to trigger, in case it is a tab, or ctr, or shift...
[06:40:08] <Anticom2> cusco solution is the way, the chars are arranged in the table
[06:40:14] <Anticom2> you can split it up into ranges
[06:40:30] <ollie314> Hi everybody ! :)
[06:40:42] <Anticom2> ho ollie314
[06:40:44] <cusco> there could be something ready for that...
[06:41:01] <Anticom2> or you could figure it out on your own :P
[06:41:13] <Anticom2> cusco 0-31 = non printed, 32-126 printed
[06:41:15] <Anticom2> DONE
[06:41:22] <cusco> ow
[06:41:24] <Anticom2> that's all you need to know to do your thing
[06:41:25] <ollie314> is anyone can help me about an IE9 very strange issue aroung using ajax ?
[06:41:34] <cusco> thanks
[06:41:45] <Anticom2> ollie314 solution is simple: don't use IE :D
[06:41:52] <Anticom2> cusco reference: http://www.asciitable.com/index/asciifull.gif
[06:41:57] <ollie314> no choice sniff
[06:42:09] <Anticom2> then you're lost ollie314 :D
[06:42:24] <Anticom2> no seriously... i'm not the right one, when it comes to cross browser stuff
[06:42:59] <cusco> ollie314: whats the issue
[06:43:05] <cusco> cross domain?
[06:43:20] <ollie314> IE9 seems to never send any request using a post (I can't show the post request in the dev tools and also in the server log). The key is that it works fine on all other browsers
[06:43:33] <ollie314> cross domain yes, but ...
[06:43:59] <ollie314> I tried many and many solution pfound on the web
[06:43:59] <cusco> well, can you see on the server logs that the target does get a POST ?
[06:44:02] <ollie314> charsert
[06:44:05] <ollie314> jsonp
[06:44:09] <ollie314> and so on
[06:44:19] <ollie314> and nothing solve the issue
[06:44:39] <ollie314> IE GRRRRRR !!! :)
[06:45:04] <cusco> jsnop worked for me.. was having issues with ajax too
[06:45:13] <fillrobs> HA! just solved my jquery problem...  well that's one down - many more to go no doubt
[06:45:15] <cusco> but can you see the server log, the hit?
[06:45:28] <ollie314> are you usign a specific callback ?
[06:45:42] <cusco> hmm let me check
[06:45:48] <ollie314> no log server side for me
[06:46:02] <ollie314> I looks like the browser never send out the request ...
[06:46:13] <norbi> Anticom2:  look at this, http://jsfiddle.net/XdafK/6/ observe the word right on the google image
[06:46:16] <ollie314> based on informations provided by dev tools from IE
[06:46:20] <norbi> before scroll apears and after
[06:47:04] <norbi> this is the main problem, but my situation looks a bit different, because there are lot of positioned elements done by javascript so a wrap on them would be good
[06:47:41] <cusco> ollie314: http://paste.debian.net/178904/
[06:47:48] <cusco> ollie314: then you're still not getting there
[06:48:06] <ollie314> cusco I check, thanks
[06:48:25] <cusco> ollie314: but that is part of a external plugin, dataTable
[06:48:49] <Anticom2> norbi correct me if i'm wrong but shouldn't placing the img in the background solve the problem? http://www.quackit.com/html/codes/html_background_image_codes.cfm
[06:49:02] <cusco> ollie314: http://paste.debian.net/178905/
[06:49:11] <ollie314> ok, hum ..., no problem with this code ?
[06:49:15] <ollie314> it works fine on IE ?
[06:50:07] <cusco> ollie314: with a local file I wouldn't need to specify the .ajax(), but with a remote file, it wasn't working. And the only way to call using jsnop is specifying the .ajax in 'fnServerData'
[06:50:11] <Anticom2> norbi oh i just saw you're appending to the image
[06:50:13] <cusco> yes it works on ie9 and ie8
[06:50:38] <Anticom2> no are you?
[06:50:52] <Anticom2> sorry, my brain is currently in semi-standby :/
[06:51:03] <ollie314> cusco : I'm testing ...
[06:51:06] <DarsVaeda> is the id of an element an attribute or a property?
[06:51:35] <norbi> Anticom2: so this is the solution i thought of: http://jsfiddle.net/XdafK/8/
[06:51:46] <norbi> i make the scroll to appear from begining
[06:52:19] <norbi> but what if the content doest trigger the scroll bar after it is faded in? then the problem is that it doesnt appear
[06:53:03] <norbi> then i remain with a 20px white border on right
[06:53:31] <norbi> an if() would be good like
[06:54:34] <norbi> if(content.height() > window.height()){ wraper.height(5000); } then wrapper.height(auto);
[06:55:21] <io__> hi anybody can look at this? http://pastebin.com/P3rp64FK why isn t the counter ... counting?
[06:56:31] <Anticom2> io__ use jsfiddle.net
[06:57:04] <norbi> Anticom2: so what do you think?
[06:57:28] <Anticom2> thinking still in progress norbi :D
[06:57:50] <norbi> io__: does your code run the counter++ part?
[06:58:16] <norbi> make a console out before it and after it to be sure it runs
[06:58:51] <norbi> io__: plus as how i can see from here u are ressetting the counter at every loop
[06:59:11] <ollie314> cusco : same result ...
[06:59:30] <BMCouto> Hi does anyone has any idea why is jquery making get requests with -weblt-linear-gradient ? never happened to me before
[06:59:33] <norbi> like for(;;){var i=1; i++; if(i>3)i=1;}
[06:59:43] <norbi> io__: here i will be all the time 1
[06:59:50] <norbi> Anticom2: :D
[06:59:59] <ollie314> is any workaround is necessary to pass no string data as parameter in the ajax configuration ?
[07:00:15] <norbi> ollie314: what?
[07:00:17] <norbi> :)
[07:00:49] <ollie314> $.ajax( { cache : "false" or cache : false
[07:00:56] <ollie314> ?
[07:01:16] <ollie314> is it the same thing for IE ?
[07:01:25] <norbi> not "false"
[07:01:29] <norbi> simply false
[07:01:36] <ollie314> ok thanks
[07:01:37] <norbi> cache: false :)
[07:02:43] <norbi> ollie314: what are you doing ?:)
[07:03:01] <norbi> are u sending ajax request for a html page?
[07:03:17] <io__> ok got it i had the variable inside the loop...
[07:03:26] <Mohsen_Hassani> I'm using JQuery ui dialog. The passage I write in it is messed up. Is there anything I have to pay attention to while using it?
[07:03:26] <norbi> io__: told ya
[07:03:27] <norbi> :)
[07:03:47] <norbi> io__: "norbi: like for(; ; ){var i=1; i++; if(i>3)i=1;}"
[07:04:34] <BMCouto> Hi does anyone has any idea why is jquery making get requests with -weblt-linear-gradient ? never happened to me before
[07:06:22] <Anticom2> norbi oh now i see.. you want to write some kind of image gallery thing?
[07:07:01] <Anticom2> norbi http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/
[07:08:15] <alcuadrado> is there a way to select all anchors that have a specified href, and its value doesn't start with # ?
[07:09:26] <Anticom2> alcuadrado well then it wouldn't be an anchor anymore, would it?
[07:11:16] <Anticom2> oh i see... you want to select the references leading to anchors?
[07:12:13] <Whirl3d> Good morning all.
[07:12:52] <alcuadrado> Anticom2, I want all links, not the #anchors. got it: a[href]:not([href^=#])
[07:13:07] <Anticom2> looking good
[07:13:09] <Anticom2> wb Whirl3d
[07:13:36] <Whirl3d> ty hows it going this morning?
[07:14:41] <Anticom2> my brain is basically like pudding
[07:14:46] <Anticom2> except that... well, fine
[07:14:47] <Anticom2> :D
[07:15:09] <Whirl3d> If I am binding "event handlers" to custom events, does the context of $(this) change inside the handler definiition and if I am setting up a "template" div that I use to clone, can I bind events to the template so that they are then bound to the clones as well, or do that seperately?
[07:15:55] <Whirl3d> you get used to puddin brain after I while, I found. Pretty soon, it's unusual not to have puddin brain...
[07:18:10] <decalpha> hi
[07:18:20] <Whirl3d> hi there.
[07:18:41] <Anticom2> Whirl3d it's mostly the weather and the leaking supply of coffee and cigarettes :D
[07:19:30] <norbi> Anticom2: i figured out, thanks :)
[07:19:36] <Whirl3d> where are you located...sounds like Atlanta
[07:22:33] <Wolf_22> Does anyone know how to retain the last CSS font-size loaded for links? (I'm resizing the font to a menu and every time the page reloads, the previous font-size is reset and only resized to the intended jQuery-set font-size when the window is adjusted as per the $(window).resize conditions I have now...)
[07:24:51] <Whirl3d> You could set a cookie and then tell the page to look at the cookie on load and adjust accordingly
[07:25:15] <Anticom2> norbi good to hear :')
[07:25:30] <Whirl3d> Other than that, you really don't have any way that I know of for changing or controlling settings between page loads
[07:25:37] <Anticom2> Whirl3d with the hint, that i'm addicted to beer the question should be answered ;D
[07:26:27] <Wolf_22> Whirl3d: I'll research your suggestion. Thanks. :)
[07:26:59] <tplaner_> hi, is there an easy way to wrap a tag around a DocumentFragment using jquery?
[07:27:26] <Whirl3d> there's .wrap()...but I am not sure what you mean by document fragment
[07:27:35] <Whirl3d> and there's .wrapInner
[07:27:45] <Whirl3d> wolf_22, np
[07:28:28] <tplaner_> Whirl3d: http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html#ID-B63ED1A3 thats a DocumentFragment
[07:28:55] <Wolf_22> Whirl3d: Just out of curiosity, how much of a hassle do you think doing this would be? I wouldn't think it would be that hard to do (I've never been forced to work directly with cookie API stuff).
[07:29:40] <tplaner_> Whirl3d: thank you, .wrap seems to have done the trick!
[07:30:11] <Whirl3d> wolf_22, the problem with cookies is the UK
[07:30:17] <Whirl3d> Or maybe EU
[07:30:53] <Wolf_22> Whirl3d: I'm sorry man, but are you joking or being serious here?
[07:30:56] <Whirl3d> I am not sure, but one of them requires that you put a big sign up on the page that announces that you are using cookies and forces them to say YES before continuing
[07:31:04] <Whirl3d> It's a law now
[07:31:10] <Wolf_22> Whirl3d: Oh...
[07:31:19] <Wolf_22> Whirl3d: I didn't realize that...
[07:31:25] <Whirl3d> I don't know the particulars, but it kind of defeats the point of a cookie if you ask me
[07:31:48] <Wolf_22> Whirl3d: More red tape stuff I suppose. It's life anymore.
[07:31:51] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: It's all for the greater good, as defined by the nanny state.
[07:32:13] <Whirl3d> Yeah, that was baiting. LOL
[07:33:47] <Whirl3d> so I have a "tooltip" of sorts that I need to postion relatively close to a link. It's importan tthat the tooltip doe not extend past the link's parent container bounds and by it's nature, it can't be partially hidden...Anybody know of a good system to accommodate such positioning?
[07:34:22] <MichMich> Hi Guys
[07:34:24] <Lost123> http://jsfiddle.net/QW3aW/
[07:34:30] <MichMich> Short question...
[07:34:30] <Lost123> i cannot make it work
[07:34:32] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: I can't say it'll cover all your bases, but have you looked at Cluetip?
[07:34:38] <Whirl3d> Hi MichMich
[07:35:04] <Whirl3d> Lost123, before I go on this random goose chase for ya, why not shed some lght as to the problem you are having.
[07:35:19] <MichMich> if $(".element") returns 10 elements, how can is use the 6th element.... Ie: $(".element")[6].fadeIn();
[07:35:21] <Whirl3d> nope. I'm checkin it out now. thanks.
[07:35:47] <Lost123> Whirl3d:  i want to be able to make images point to link , but only that image which has the display:block prpeprty
[07:35:58] <Lost123> can you please look at the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/QW3aW/
[07:35:59] <Whirl3d> MichMIch, use .eq(6)   or maybe eq(5)
[07:36:00] <warrenparsons> MichMich: $('.element').eq(6).fadeIn();
[07:36:10] <MichMich> great! thanks
[07:36:43] <MichMich> works... thanks!
[07:37:08] <warrenparsons> ? eq @ MichMich
[07:37:09] <bot-t> MichMich, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[07:37:31] <Whirl3d> Lost123, what are you asking? You want to check the display properties before linking?
[07:37:38] <Lost123> yes Whirl3d
[07:37:39] <norbi> guys
[07:38:07] <Lost123> i want to check if display property is set to block , only then make the image link to a url
[07:38:15] <Whirl3d> so, add a coniditional if (!$(this).css("display")=="block") {don't do nothing}
[07:38:47] <warrenparsons> Lost123: That's going to be an expensive operation. Also, an image is not a link. You'll need to wrap it in a link tag. You're better off using classes or some other means of selecting.
[07:38:52] <Whirl3d> or if $(this).css("display")=="block") window.location=$(this).data("href");
[07:39:26] <Lost123> Whirl3d: i am doing this because i am using a slider and when i wrap images in links, it breaks
[07:39:30] <Whirl3d> but you can click an image, and he's storing the href in it's data object, so he's good
[07:40:17] <Whirl3d> and since he's changing pages on click, it's not likely to cost a lot more than a page change..
[07:40:38] <Whirl3d> I agree with warrenparsons, there's prolly a better way to do it
[07:41:23] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: The whole question just sounds like there's a weak architecture in place here. My point was that selecting by CSS values is expensive compared to lookup by class, especially with many elements.
[07:41:29] <Whirl3d> Perhaps a better slider? One that accommodated hot-linking?
[07:41:45] <Whirl3d> That's why I agreed with you.
[07:41:45] <Lost123> Whirl3d:  like which onw
[07:41:49] <Whirl3d> 8)
[07:42:01] <decripter37> hello!
[07:42:13] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: Bah, I was on a roll and wasn't going to delete it all just because you agreed with me :p
[07:42:28] <Whirl3d> got ya. Been there.
[07:42:31] <Whirl3d> lol
[07:42:39] <Whirl3d> hello decripter37
[07:42:40] <Lost123> warrenparsons: i understand what you mean but that involves changing the slider plugin code and putting in classes
[07:43:16] <Whirl3d> the way I showed you should work, just don't let anybody else see your code. And if you do, be embarrassed by it. LOL
[07:43:25] <warrenparsons> Lost123: I hear you. If it's a one-off use, it's probably not a big deal. But if you're going to reuse this thing, you're better off making it better from the start.
[07:43:47] <Whirl3d> Testify!
[07:44:17] <decripter37> I have this thing:
[07:44:24] <warrenparsons> Way too many shitty plugins started their lives under the "We'll only use this junk once," mindset.
[07:44:57] <Whirl3d> I have the exact oposite problem. I can't get my plugins done because there's just one more thing I got to add....
[07:45:35] <decripter37> ps: I tried $('#pippo').children().children().each($(this).click(function(){alert("fuuu")}));  but desn't work!
[07:45:51] <Whirl3d> decripter37, if this is your first time (relatively) to this channel, it's fast fast fast sometimes. So spit it out. What are you trying to do.
[07:46:06] <Whirl3d> try .find
[07:46:28] <Lost123> http://jsfiddle.net/QW3aW/1/ doesn't work
[07:46:28] <Whirl3d> $("#pippo").find("something").click()     or use .on on pippo like this:
[07:46:33] <warrenparsons> Whirl3d: This plugin currently has 8 LOC in the function body, and I've modified it numerous times. Believe me when I say I understand LOL - https://github.com/warrenparsons/jquery-open-external-links/blob/master/jquery.openExternalLinks.js
[07:47:03] <decripter37> what the something stands for?
[07:47:06] <Whirl3d> $("#pippo).on("click", "buttonclass",function () {do stuff with button});
[07:47:22] <Whirl3d> a class identifier. Some way to identify the object
[07:47:42] <Whirl3d> it could be a nodetype like "a" if you only have one "a" element
[07:47:55] <decripter37> I've not a class, i know only that what i want bind is children children of the pippo's div
[07:48:18] <decripter37> a lot of children
[07:48:44] <decripter37> just like some sort of rabbit div
[07:49:20] <Whirl3d> you're gonna have to have a way to identify the thing that you want. You could use children().children() but it's weak.
[07:49:44] <Whirl3d> just don't use the $(this) in your above statement
[07:49:50] <Lost123> Whirl3d:  can you look at this http://jsfiddle.net/QW3aW/1/
[07:49:55] <decripter37> so, I can just use find("a").each()
[07:50:04] <Whirl3d> $("#pippo").children().children().click(function (e) { stuf});
[07:50:36] <decripter37> I'll try your last entry
[07:50:40] <Whirl3d> yes if you want the handler to apply to all anchors
[07:51:19] <Whirl3d> Lost123 , you need to know how to use developer tools. Are you familiar with console?
[07:51:29] <Lost123> yes
[07:51:38] <Whirl3d> there's a blatant typo
[07:52:01] <Anticom2> i'm out for today
[07:52:04] <Whirl3d> you should see that in the console window without having to ask for help. You need the if ( <---missing (
[07:52:04] <Anticom2> have a nice weekend all!
[07:52:15] <Whirl3d> Anticom2, back to ya

[07:52:38] <keirlav87> I have a div that animates its height to reveal content, and then animates back to original height on second click, however in firefox all the content below stays fixed too far down after slideup, as though the div is still expanded, can anyone help with this please?
[07:53:06] <decripter37> Whirl3d: Whirl3d: your last entry doesn't work mmm... I'm trying the find
[07:53:51] <Whirl3d> decripter37, post your code to jsfiddle and share a link back here. It's the best way to get help. Make sure to include CSS, HTML, and JS...simple use case is best.
[07:54:35] <Whirl3d> keirlav87, you might  have better luck asking #css (though they'll send you back here.). I would suggest posting your code to jsfiddle as an example and let us look at it.

[07:59:32] <jedimind> wtf is that
[07:59:33] <decripter37> this is what 0i have
[07:59:43] <decripter37> I's a mess XD
[08:00:04] <keirlav87> ah its ok, I think it was a css issue - the content that was being pushed down was wrapped in an unfloated div with auto margin to center it, and I put an extra layer inside this with float:left and it seems to have fixed the problem
[08:00:16] <Lost123> Whirl3d:  the console shows no error now http://jsfiddle.net/QW3aW/4/
[08:00:19] <decripter37> I want to bind click to all the voices on the multioption
[08:00:40] <Whirl3d> Lost123, nice...you fixed it I see
[08:00:47] <thomedy775> i think the js room is broken right now...but im sure that those here are equally solid in pure js
[08:01:07] <Lost123> it doesn't work still
[08:01:08] <thomedy775> im rehauling all my code cuz im insistent on not giving up and nailing this design
[08:01:15] <thomedy775> that being said
[08:01:26] <thomedy775> im new to the canvas object
[08:01:37] <jedimind> decripter37, http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/4x6jL/2/
[08:01:39] <thomedy775> and what im trying to accomplish for some reason isn't working
[08:01:43] <thomedy775> i cant figure it out
[08:01:46] <thomedy775> i hava  fiddle
[08:01:50] <Whirl3d> Lost123, am I going to have to spend the day babysitting your code....look back trhough it. This time you are missing the letter s

[08:02:33] <decripter37> jedimind: Thanks!
[08:02:38] <Lost123> oh thank you so much Whirl3d
[08:03:16] <thomedy775> this time im trying to accomplish a smoother animation through the canvas object...a nd i have done a lot of learning in the last few days i feel my code is much stronger
[08:03:20] <thomedy775> im oop now
[08:03:22] <thomedy775> for one thing
[08:03:42] <thomedy775> but i cant figure out with canvas isn't drawing my image
[08:03:59] <thomedy775> apart from the fact that it wont have the image in the directory like i do locally it doens't work on my machine either
[08:04:11] <thomedy775> i have my src i seee it in fire bug but not in the canvas
[08:04:38] <thomedy775> http://jsfiddle.net/9r6yh/1/
[08:04:40] <thomedy775> just in case
[08:05:27] <Whirl3d> thomedy775, while I appreciate your thirst, you have jumped out of the frying pan into the fire. Good luck with all that. I think you are getting way ahead of yourself and from just looking at the fiddle you posted, it lacks some fundamental understanding that makes it highly unlikely that your going to have an easy time of it.
[08:06:11] <Whirl3d> you define a variable and that's it
[08:06:13] <thomedy775> thats fine... im not worried about difficult im concerned about good... so im open to constructive criticism... or just a tut or something
[08:06:38] <thomedy775> until i animate it it works... i can call my object  and change the animation with .style.left
[08:06:45] <thomedy775> as an object but once i call raf
[08:06:51] <thomedy775> i get nothing
[08:06:52] <RohanBhangui> thomedy775: Whirl#d is right you should study from sites like http://jqfundamentals.com/    but to give you a push to fix your bug try using css to mark borders for certain elements
[08:07:49] <RohanBhangui> Whirl3d: isnt h suppose to use $(this) instead of this?
[08:07:52] <thomedy775> sorry im on the wrong jsfiddle... this  one hasnt worked yet... so i will eve3n more so yeild to you knowledge..but i cant give upt
[08:07:55] <thomedy775> so im on it
[08:08:12] <thomedy775> im typing so fast im forgetting letters some where in there is a sentence
[08:08:33] <RohanBhangui> thomedy775: read http://jqfundamentals.com/
[08:08:38] <thomedy775> okay thank you...
[08:08:38] <RohanBhangui> trust it will help
[08:09:59] <RohanBhangui> thomedy775: your canvas is showing but you gotta give it some properties http://jsfiddle.net/9r6yh/2/

[08:21:40] <jedimind> my internet is soooo slow
[08:21:48] <jedimind> Whirl3d, i finally got around to changing my portfolio site after 3 years
[08:21:52] <jedimind> lol
[08:22:19] <jedimind> and by change, i mean mostly take it down :) www.pud.ca
[08:22:32] <norbi> "norbi: do you have any experiences with this: http://code.google.com/p/ufd/wiki/Usage ?"
[08:23:33] <Whirl3d> That is hilarious... I need to do that too
[08:24:01] <Whirl3d> except mine would read more like, I am embarrasignly unable to complete a poject...
[08:26:21] <jedimind> lol
[08:26:59] <Whirl3d> You're working in Atlanta with Blast Radius, huh?
[08:27:25] <jedimind> i was working for BR in toronto, but flew down to atlanta a bunch of times for COX
[08:27:29] <jedimind> but that was years ago
[08:27:32] <jedimind> that resume is way outdated too
[08:27:35] <jedimind> i should update it
[08:28:35] <Whirl3d> Drats. I was thinking that someone else might actually be using computers in Atlanta. I guess not. LOL
[08:28:56] <warrenparsons> My site hasn't been touched in 4 years. Welcome to 2008! http://warrenparsons.com/
[08:29:07] <Whirl3d> Your resume (outdated or not) looks great. Visually it's very nicely laid out as well.
[08:30:34] <norbi> warrenparsons: i thought it is responsive
[08:30:50] <Whirl3d> I have this great idea for my site...I'm just waiting for the technology to catch up so I can do it. LOL
[08:30:57] <warrenparsons> norbi: Nope. That's just an illusion ;)
[08:30:57] <Whirl3d> yeah, yeah. that works.
[08:31:08] <norbi> warrenparsons: because it really looks like a responsive website with that width, but it's not just too large width
[08:31:45] <jedimind> Whirl3d, i need to dig up that indesign file to update it
[08:31:45] <RohanBhangui_> ha  i exist has two people
[08:31:45] <RohanBhangui_> jokes
[08:31:47] <norbi> Whirl3d: :)) responsive websites are not new, they just make it look like new
[08:31:54] <jedimind> it took forever to set up that resume like that
[08:32:17] <Whirl3d> norbi, huh?
[08:32:43] <norbi> nvm
[08:32:59] <thomedy583> i have no questions just an update...all i had to do was switch the order of 2 lines reverse them and it works now...
[08:33:03] <norbi> warrenparsons: why did u optimized it for 1280 resolution?
[08:33:05] <thomedy583> no questions though i wasn't far off
[08:33:05] <RohanBhangui> lol i changed back
[08:33:07] <thomedy583> it works fine now
[08:33:11] <RohanBhangui> tell me something
[08:33:19] <RohanBhangui> for a graphic designer/web desginer
[08:33:24] <warrenparsons> norbi: Because it was *my* site, and I wanted to design something not limited to 1024.
[08:33:27] <RohanBhangui> what sort of setup for site would you suggest
[08:33:39] <RohanBhangui> cause i plan to put one up soon
[08:34:07] <Whirl3d> I want a 3D rotating animation of the globe and a set of glasses at the bottom of the viewport. You pick up a pair of glasses and as they approach your "face", the view of the globe changes in it's lenses. Then to get to the sections, you click a continent...
[08:34:41] <thang> ಠ_ಠ
[08:34:52] <Whirl3d> like 3 sets of glasses. So one set of glasses the globe would be all modern and technical looking. But another would look all cartoony like.
[08:35:36] <Whirl3d> It would be trying to underline the notion that your view of the world is different based on your perspective. So here's 3 different perspectives on my portfolio.
[08:36:00] <Whirl3d> needless to say it's not likely to be done any time soon.
[08:36:26] <thomedy583> thats cool whirl3d
[08:36:54] <thomedy583> i like that both conceptually and the way it seems like your trying to implement it
[08:40:46] <jedimind> Whirl3d, like pyrovision in TF2
[08:41:00] <jedimind> you can probably use a similar concept to say impress.js
[08:41:04] <nanovirus> ahoy!
[08:41:08] <jedimind> to pull off that 3d world visual switch thing
[08:42:19] <Whirl3d> I am not sure what pyrovision in TF2, but I just had a craving to play TF2 for the first time in a long while. LOL
[08:42:33] <jedimind> its a new thing they released for meet the pyro
[08:42:42] <jedimind> you equip these glasses, and the whole world is all cartoony and crazy
[08:42:46] <jedimind> on all the maps
[08:43:01] <nanovirus> I have this --> $submit = $('#submit', $page) .... and later on we use have some stuff going on for the $submit click action.  Now I want to now assign $submit to any element beginning #submit (could be #submit_1 or #submit_2)
[08:43:04] <nanovirus> how can I do this?
[08:43:10] <Whirl3d> Exactly!
[08:44:20] <mikedaigle> Hello im having issues with a form on my site using an upload button it tells me: Timestamp: 7/13/2012 11:43:02 AM Error: $("#wpuf-attachment-upload-filelist ul.wpuf-attachment-list").sortable is not a function Source File: http://development.thedesignatedsketcher.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-user-frontend/js/attachment.js?ver=3.4.1 Line: 11
[08:44:34] <Whirl3d> nanovirus, use $("[id^='submit_']"); I think.   it's one of those attribute selectors
[08:45:07] <nanovirus> Whirl3d, awesome, thank you!
[08:45:43] <Whirl3d> if it's not ^=, you can find it under "attribute selectors" in the api.jquery.com site
[08:46:47] <nanovirus> Whirl3d, dude... you're a legend. thank you muchly!
[08:49:23] <ok_> hi all, anyone written a jq only get from the undocumented google currency API by any chance? just having some jsonp related issues
[08:50:30] <ok_> parsing the response with php is all well and good but i really need a js only solution
[08:51:30] <thirdender> ok_: haven't looked, but curious what the jsonp issues are?
[08:52:53] <ok_> thirdender: basically i don't seem to be able to get a jsonp response out of it
[08:53:11] <ok_> thirdender: so hitting allow-origin problems
[08:53:42] <thirdender> ok_: ah :-p
[08:55:22] <thirdender> ok_: are you using the google.com/ig/... address? iGoogle will be shut down in a little over a year (http://www.google.com/ig)
[08:55:25] <ok_> thirdender: at least the way round i think its looking at it, i usually try to keep well away from the jq stuff but seem to have been shouldered with this api lookup, so I'm not 100% thats whats happening, I'm getting xmlhttprequest cannot load [url]. Origin [local] is not allowed by acc-cont-all-orig
[08:55:44] <decripter37> end of work, bye people have a nice rest-of-the-day
[08:55:52] <ok_> oh really?
[08:56:06] <ok_> thirdender: didn't know that thats, do you know if they've replaced it?
[08:56:50] <thirdender> ok_: kind of... the announcement says it better than I could, but basically they though the web was going in a widget direction, then they figured it had evolved in a different direction entirely
[08:57:38] <ok_> thirdender: i guess i should "learn more" then, thanks for the pointer
[08:59:49] <thirdender> ok_: np... not sure if the google.com/ig/calculator is going the way of the dodo with google.com/ig/, but it might be... there should be other ways to do this too, since currency conversion results show up on google.com searches too. best of luck :-p
[09:01:24] <ok_> thirdender: yea it shouldn't be too tricky, thanks again
[09:13:58] <ok_> thirdender: fyi http://www.google.com/finance/converter
[09:17:41] <thirdender> ok_: nice :-p also, https://developers.google.com/finance/docs/2.0/developers_guide_js, although I don't know if it can be made to do conversions or not...
[09:17:59] <Whirl3d> is there any way to determine the mouse coordinates that doesn't involve an event.
[09:20:22] <ok_> thirdender: yea I've seen about that that might but i was hoping not to have to go wading through all of google finance to find out
[09:20:46] <thirdender> ok_: lol, yep :-p had the same feeling trying to get spreadsheet data a few weeks ago
[09:22:05] <ok_> thirdender: cheers for the shout about igoogle, although its prob cost me a bit in future dev when it broke, hehe
[09:22:33] <thirdender> ok_: lol :-p
[09:40:12] <BFranks> Anyone else find that the HTML5 <meter> element is nice but doesn't 'theme' very where with jQuery UI theme switcher?
[09:40:37] <BFranks> +well
[09:45:27] <initself> is this syntax bad? error parsing attribute name
[09:45:29] <initself> for ( ;i<len; i++ ) {
[09:46:56] <shoky> Whirl3d: don't think so ;p
[09:48:50] <Davey> when doing custom events, does, why would foo.bar.baz also get triggered for foo.baz?
[09:53:31] <shoky> Davey: because foo.bar.baz  means 'set the foo event, put it in namespaces bar and baz'
[09:53:52] <shoky> from the docs:  For example, "click.myPlugin.simple" defines both the myPlugin and simple namespaces for this particular click event.
[09:54:16] <shoky> Namespaces are similar to CSS classes in that they are not hierarchical; only one name needs to match.
[09:54:18] <horrror> hi - I need a two rows slider of DIVS - 4 divs in each row that when i click next it slides in 4 new divs. anybody know a good plugin? I've tried bxSlider but it doesn't support two-rows
[09:54:27] <Davey> shoky: oh
[09:55:11] <Davey> shoky: thank you, great explanation :)
[09:55:23] <shoky> ;]
[09:55:45] <horrror> https://gist.github.com/3105962 - How can I make bxSlider support multiple rows ?
[09:55:51] <horrror> of divs
[09:56:30] <horrror> i have this css which renders as 2 rows of 8 divs (4 each) - and when i activate bxslider it changes to 8 divs in one row
[10:05:15] <thirdender> horrror: what about changing your HTML to four columns with your top row and bottom row content in each?
[10:06:21] <thirdender> horrror: a lot of Javascript slider plugins work with the idea of childNodes... if you have 8 children beneath the element you use, the Javascript typically assumes each is a separate thing, hence all 8 showing as one row
[10:07:56] <horrror> hmm ok then what are you suggesting i didn't udnerstand
[10:11:26] <windsurf_> I'm looking for a high level suggestion for (North American) formatted phone numbers within input fields. I know how to format. It's keeping the input field usable that I'm not sure about. Like, user is restricted from entering non-numeric characters, but can maybe enter brackets and dashes.. on lose focus, strip non-numeric, pass through regex and display formatted??
[10:15:56] <jedimind> windsurf_,
[10:16:06] <jedimind> http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[10:16:14] <windsurf_> just found this, looks cool how they're doing it
[10:16:14] <windsurf_> http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/labs/mask/demos/mask/default.html
[10:16:20] <windsurf_> jedimind: oh thanks, checking..
[10:16:31] <jedimind> basically the exact same thing
[10:16:42] <windsurf_> yeah that looks awesome
[10:16:44] <windsurf_> very usable
[10:19:09] <windsurf_> thanks btw
[10:20:25] <jedimind> no problem :)
[10:21:14] <shoky> horrror: he's suggesting putting two rows in your slides..
[10:21:29] <horrror> how?
[10:21:58] <shoky> ..
[10:22:04] <shoky> one row, then the other
[10:22:07] <shoky> sec
[10:22:10] <horrror> lol
[10:22:23] <horrror> but it was two rows and the slider made it one row
[10:22:24] <jedimind> lol
[10:24:54] <Connor_> Anyone need any help?
[10:25:38] <ajpiano> Connor_: are you connor montgomery
[10:26:00] <Connor_> Nope
[10:26:17] <ajpiano> oh, that would have been a strange coincidence
[10:26:39] <iheartjs> ajpiano: are you a piano? because that would be awesome
[10:27:41] <shoky> horrror adunno smth like http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/T2pA3/
[10:28:39] <Whirl3d> does anybody know of a good system for positioning "tooltips" so they dont get cut off or appear outside the window or on top of one another?
[10:28:55] <jcbk> okay so im trying to use jquery-cookie to retrieve the value for a certain cookie. I'm seeing it in the web inspector, but whatever I try it just returns "null" instead of the value thats meant to be returned...what am i doing wrong?
[10:29:26] <horrror> shoky: genius
[10:30:03] <shoky> credit goes to kitties
[10:30:17] <ajpiano> iheartjs: i am not, in fact.
[10:32:20] <Connor_> jcbk - got code example?
[10:33:08] <jcbk> Connor_: $.cookie('foo')
[10:33:13] <jcbk> returns null
[10:33:30] <iheartjs> jcbk: the reason could be a lot of things, hard to say without a more complete example
[10:33:33] <Connor_> And how are you setting it?
[10:33:45] <jcbk> I cant really put it in jsfiddle or anything, as it's set by the backend
[10:33:47] <jcbk> Flask (python)
[10:33:59] <jcbk> but I literally see it in the web inspector
[10:34:11] <Connor_> I don't really know much about jquery-cookie but try
[10:34:11] <Connor_> $.cookie('the_cookie', { raw: true });
[10:34:13] <Connor_> ?
[10:34:20] <Connor_> Otherwise try get it withotu the plugin
[10:34:26] <Connor_> Then you know if it's the plugin or not
[10:34:30] <Connor_> Narrows down your issue
[10:34:40] <jcbk> null too
[10:35:01] <jcbk> I tried that (id prefer to not use a plugin) but it's fairly complicated to pick a certain cookie out of the jar
[10:35:13] <Connor_> Try console loggin document.cookie
[10:35:46] <Connor_> See if it shows up
[10:36:11] <jcbk> it doesnt no...only a cookie I just set myself on the console
[10:36:23] <jcbk> why's that, there's a whole bunch in the inspector...is there a difference?
[10:36:24] <Connor_> It's not being set correctly I assume then
[10:36:30] <Connor_> Could be time based
[10:36:35] <nebmo> I cant get the jquery do what its mean to do (http://jsfiddle.net/rvreQ/) when you click the table cell, its meant to add the class 'highlighted'. what is wrong?
[10:37:53] <Whirl3d> anybody have a good prefilter plugin to add vendor prefixes to css properties?
[10:43:51] <iheartjs> nebmo: have you tried using .click()?
[10:46:46] <Connor_> nebmo it's because in your css you are doing #calendar table
[10:46:51] <Connor_> But calendar is already a table
[10:46:56] <Connor_> So get rid of table
[10:47:06] <Connor_> That took way too long to figure out
[10:47:10] <Connor_> Also, change it to click event
[10:49:22] <jcbk> Connor_ could jquery-cookie be returning null because the cookie is encrypted?
[10:49:35] <Connor_> Not if you are passing a string
[10:49:49] <jcbk> no thats what I thought
[10:49:54] <Connor_> Uhm
[10:49:59] <Connor_> Is it a long value you are trying to pass?
[10:50:02] <Connor_> Cookies have data limits
[10:51:29] <jcbk> well Im not passing a value to it
[10:51:31] <jcbk> it's already saved
[10:51:35] <jcbk> im just trying to retrieve it
[10:51:54] <Connor_> I mean in Python
[10:51:57] <Connor_> when you are setting it
[10:52:04] <jcbk> ah
[10:52:26] <jcbk> it's not particularly big, Safari reports it as 143 which I assume are bytes
[10:53:10] <MistuhKurtz> So, I have these full-window sized carousel slideshows, and they stack on top of each other. The client wants the slideshows to "click" into place when the top edge is scrolled within, say, 50-100 pixels or so. An example gallery is up here: http://brookfield-la.epxhost.com/samples/carousel/
[10:53:20] <jcbk> "9aU7To87dJCE7c9RvXjRqikXoIg=?_expires=STEzNDQ4Njk5MDIKLg==&_permanent=STAxCi4=&foo=VkdCUApwMQou&bar=VlVTRApwMQou"
[10:53:25] <MistuhKurtz> I'm thinking of using jQuery waypoints - http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/
[10:53:28] <jcbk> that's the whole cookie, so nothing massive
[10:53:44] <MistuhKurtz> and here's kind of an example: http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/sticky-elements/
[10:54:07] <MistuhKurtz> does anybody have any ideas for a way to approach it? I was thinking maybe use the waypoint callback to make the element "fixed" position?
[10:54:24] <Connor_> jcbk, can you try passing a simpler string for a test
[10:54:28] <Connor_> Just like hello world or something
[10:54:41] <pneftali> hi guys - can u recommend me a photo gallery slider like the one yahoo is using ?
[10:55:13] <jcbk> Connor_ well it's encrypted, so even hello world would turn out be the same length
[10:55:25] <jcbk> actually the values saved are even shorter than Hello World
[10:55:31] <Connor_> Pass a non encrypted string
[10:55:39] <Connor_> Just need to make sure it actually works
[10:55:46] <Connor_> Could be a setting in your browser etc
[10:55:57] <Connor_> pneftali http://coffeescripter.com/code/ad-gallery/#ad-image-0
[10:55:58] <jcbk> okay I'll try, not sure if I can disable encryption
[10:56:19] <Connor_> MistuhKurtz Waypoints is pretty good
[10:56:25] <Connor_> But shouldn't be too hard to write your own
[10:57:00] <pneftali> Connor_: yep i saw that one. but it does not work the same way with yahoo unfortunately out of the box.
[10:57:19] <Connor_> Not sure you are going to get many that work the same way out of the box
[10:57:33] <Connor_> jQuery cycle is pretty much the ultimate tbh
[10:57:48] <Connor_> As you can do anything with it, you just need to know how to use it correctly
[10:59:33] <MistuhKurtz> Well way points fits in perfectly Connor_, it's just, what do I write in the callback to accomplish the effect?
[11:00:23] <Connor_> One sec, we did it for the company I work for like last week
[11:00:27] <Connor_> Let me just look up the code
[11:01:13] <MistuhKurtz> o yeah? nice thanks :D
[11:01:27] <codepython7771>  in css , can i say -- height of element should be 50% of its current width? -- or do i need to use jquery to do this?
[11:02:31] <Connor_> MistuhKurtz http://swd-1.com/work look in source line 587
[11:02:47] <Connor_> I didn't write the code so not sure exactlly how it works
[11:03:05] <Connor_> But look up the sticky class in the css file and see what it does
[11:03:16] <Connor_> codepython7771 you will need jquery to do that
[11:04:09] <Connor_> Pretty sure you would just want to add position fixecd
[11:04:27] <Connor_> And then when wantign to do the opposite, remove position fixed and add margin-top
[11:04:30] <Connor_> See like 609
[11:04:35] <Connor_> line 609*
[11:04:42] <MistuhKurtz> so it adds/removes the .sticky class
[11:04:54] <Connor_> Pretty much I think
[11:05:18] <Connor_> Just making it work when you scroll out of the sticky area
[11:05:23] <MistuhKurtz> the only thing is, I'm worried if I do that with my sliders, it will take them out of the document flow, and the next slider will reflow so that it's under the current one
[11:05:45] <Connor_> How do you mean sorry?
[11:05:58] <bakers> I'm doing file drag and drop and I want to set the value of an input type="file" after I drop. Is that possible?
[11:06:07] <bakers> Seems like editting input type=file is not allowed
[11:06:20] <Connor_> What code are you using to change it @bakers?
[11:06:37] <bakers> $("#foo").val("/tmp/foo.txt")
[11:06:48] <bakers> FB throws a security error, and google says it's not a good idea to do that
[11:07:09] <Connor_> Yeah probably wouldn't let you do that due to security tbh
[11:07:37] <MistuhKurtz> do you know if there's a reason why way points has a 'viewportHeight' method?
[11:07:57] <Connor_> That's the height of the currently viewable area
[11:08:03] <Connor_> I believe
[11:08:05] <Connor_> Or maybe it's all of it
[11:08:14] <MistuhKurtz> I know, but is $(window).height() not good?
[11:08:45] <MistuhKurtz> I guess iOS can be inconsistent?
[11:08:52] <MistuhKurtz> I didn't have any issues in testing, though.
[11:09:01] <Connor_> One sec let me test
[11:09:42] <asher^> the viewport can have different dimensions to the window i believe
[11:10:09] <Connor_> Apparently it is just for iOS issues
[11:10:15] <Connor_> Probably some edge case issues
[11:10:51] <Connor_> I'd use it if it's there
[11:12:46] <codepython7771> Is scaling an image in the browser (and paying with bad rescales) avoidable using jquery?
[11:13:39] <Connor_> How are you scaling images atm?
[11:16:10] <MistuhKurtz> I'm doing a lot of image-scaling type stuff in this project codepython7771. Like, "full-bleed" slideshows. what are you trying to accomplish, perhaps I can help?
[11:16:52] <MistuhKurtz> I figured out a pretty awesome and easy way to achieve the full-bleed effect... "min-width:100%; min-height:100%; width:auto; height:auto;"
[11:19:50] <LeroyJenkins_> Hello
[11:22:46] <ow1n> Anyone here know about the status of the jQueryUI Menu widget? I'm curious how close it is to being ready for use
[11:23:37] <asher^> how do you guys organise your large jquery projects in terms of files? do you tend to group things by function/part of the site, or another way?
[11:24:03] <austinallen> why does jquery suck?
[11:25:18] <ajpiano> austinallen: i assume you have something better to do with your time than troll an irc channel, please do that instead.
[11:25:34] <austinallen> no
[11:26:20] <asher^> +b
[11:28:04] <rabbi11> alert( $("#formID1").validationEngine('validateField', "#emailInput") );     http://posabsolute.github.com/jQuery-Validation-Engine/#actions/validate-one-field   method ValidateField does not exist in jquery.validationEngine  ??? why is this error ?
[11:28:11] <Connor_> @asher^ jquery.js, plugins.js, site.js
[11:28:16] <Connor_> No point having more than 3 js files
[11:29:00] <ow1n> Connor_: You concatenate your plugin files into one?
[11:29:02] <Connor_> @rabbi11 Sounds like your plugin isn't included on the page properly
[11:29:09] <Connor_> Yep
[11:29:12] <ajpiano> asher^: using AMD modules and require.js
[11:29:54] <asher^> im talking about during dev, and im obviously keeping all the libraries separate. i have a significant amount of code ive written myself and i want to split it up to make it more managable
[11:30:35] <Connor_> You could comment your JS code clearly I guess
[11:30:43] <Connor_> Naming conventions would help aswell
[11:30:52] <danzik17> asher^: absolutely look into RequireJS
[11:30:52] <Connor_> So you can easily search for functions
[11:31:04] <rabbi11> Connor_: got it
[11:31:05] <ajpiano> asher^: nothing beats modules with explicit interfaces and clearly delineated depdencies
[11:31:12] <rabbi11> Connor_: thank you
[11:31:18] <asher^> i do, but when i get up to around 2k lines it can start being a pain to work within one file. i want to separate it out
[11:31:25] <asher^> i shall look at require.js, thanks
[11:31:33] <rabbi11> Connor_ connerhd id that you are on high definition ? :)
[11:32:08] <Connor_> Connerhd? What :P
[11:32:20] <danzik17> not only what ajpiano said, but i've personally found that testing my JS has become so much easier since using RequireJS since helps make you think about if some piece of code makes sense in a given module
[11:32:45] <rabbi11> Connor_ i have called it this way    $('form').validationEngine();   still it shows the same error ... :(
[11:33:07] <Connor_> Are you including your before you do that code?
[11:33:14] <Connor_> including your plugin*
[11:34:04] <anew_> http://pastebin.com/YC1VDLQM i cant figure out why nothing is appearing in 'users' here... is my php bad below the jq ?
[11:34:37] <rabbi11> Connor_: that's very basic i believe... any way.. i am  including it :)
[11:35:08] <Connor_> Could you provide a code sample?
[11:35:30] <Connor_> @anew_ what is _.each?
[11:36:11] <rabbi11> Connor_: too big a code and confidential as well
[11:36:50] <Connor_> Are you putting that code in $(document).ready(function(){});?
[11:36:53] <anew_> connor it should just be iterating over the object
[11:36:55] <anew_> yes
[11:36:57] <anew_> it's inside there
[11:37:01] <anew_> i think it must be something wrong with the php
[11:37:04] <anew_> is the php correct ?
[11:37:12] <Connor_> I mean is _ jquery?
[11:37:31] <Connor_> The PHP seems fine
[11:37:42] <danzik17> anew_: what's PHP outputting?  can you console.log it?
[11:38:27] <rabbi11> Connor_: yeap
[11:38:28] <anew_> let me see
[11:38:45] <rabbi11> Connor_: i am trying to validate on UI tabs
[11:39:20] <danzik17> Connor_:  fyi _.each is probably UnderscoreJS .each
[11:39:44] <Connor_> Ah I see
[11:39:53] <anew_> danzik17 in the header response {"status":"success","users":{"first":"first"}}
[11:40:46] <Connor_> @anew_ try doing .status instead of ['status']
[11:40:59] <Connor_> Also if you aren't doing this through jquery Ajax you may have to parseJSON the msg var
[11:41:10] <Connor_> And .users etc instead of ['users']
[11:41:17] <anew_> hmmmm
[11:41:33] <anew_> thing is this was someone elses and the jq was working for them
[11:41:38] <anew_> so must be something i cant see lke the php
[11:42:13] <gnarf> Connor_: _.each is likely underscore.each :)
[11:42:28] <Doxin> I'm doing $('.total_issuecount').each(function(i){this.html(3)}) but it's throwing an error, what am I doing wrong?
[11:42:35] <danzik17> anew_: what happens if you log item in your _.each loop
[11:42:41] <gnarf> _.each passes the index,value arguments to it's callback reversed
[11:42:48] <gnarf> from jQuery that is
[11:42:55] <gnarf> actually jQuery is the "reversed" one, but yeah
[11:43:00] <Connor_> @Doxin you can't pass an in to html()
[11:43:11] <anew_> danzik17 i'm not sure if i understand
[11:43:12] <Connor_> int to html()*
[11:43:19] <gnarf> also, _.each() doesn't allow short circuiting with return false
[11:43:19] <danzik17> gnarf: eh, can't blame you though since it predates the spec for .forEach.....sucks though :(
[11:43:25] <ajpiano> Connor_: that's not the problem,
[11:43:30] <Doxin> Connor_: I found the problem :P
[11:43:32] <ajpiano> Doxin: $(this)
[11:43:33] <ajpiano> ^^
[11:43:43] <Doxin> ajpiano: yeah, I just reread the docs :P
[11:43:45] <gnarf> danzik17: it doesn't predate functional programming paradigms where its usually value, index, set :)
[11:44:09] <danzik17> gnarf: fair enough - you probably know more about functional programming than i =P
[11:46:25] <danzik17> anew_: anyway, just add this line in your _.each loop:  console.log( item );
[11:47:05] <anew_> ok
[11:47:15] <gnarf> also, the value is almost always important, they key is less often important
[11:54:54] <bogardi> anyone ever see a sunset/sunrise/sun made out of jquery/html/css ?
[11:55:36] <ZeroBeholder> Just found something that might help a few people save a few minutes. http://requestb.in/ -- Assume the people on the other end are stealing your c0des. I am not affiliated. But, it will save me here and there when making AJAXy type calls.
[11:56:59] <ZeroBeholder> found it on the on{x} forums.
[11:58:27] <ZeroBeholder> on{X} after some lazy searching does not and for the time being will not support external libraries through the API unless everything is already provided for. No jquery on my automated phone event triggered scripts... sadness.
[11:59:54] <Connor_> Could you not just put jquery in the js file?
[12:03:33] <ZeroBeholder> Yes, sort of.
[12:03:58] <ZeroBeholder> But, the whole ECMA standard is not implemented completely.
[12:04:18] <ZeroBeholder> And jquery uses a whole lot of the ECMA standards.
[12:04:43] <ZeroBeholder> My teminology may not be correct, but the ideas behind the words are solid.
[12:05:12] <gnarf> um
[12:06:10] <gnarf> yeah, none of those words make much sense
[12:06:15] <gnarf> like in context
[12:07:00] <ZeroBeholder> the on{X} has done good work, but all of the things that can be done in javascript cannot be done in on{x}-- then by extension jQuery is going to run into places where it wants to do stuff and cannot.
[12:07:05] <Connor_> So it's not usign the latest JS version
[12:07:14] <ZeroBeholder> Incomplete.
[12:08:36] <ZeroBeholder> It is using an incomplete implementation of javascript.
[12:08:37] <track7> anyone working on any spotify apps or interested?
[12:10:56] <ZeroBeholder> There is an undocumented device.ajax whosit, that solves the problem I wanted jQuery for. But, I thought it was interesting and wanted to share it with people who may have thought about using jQuery on events triggered by the smartphone you carry. And the sadness when I found out the code we all know and love is not an option at this time.
[12:14:50] <MistuhKurtz> in documentation, when a parameter is surrounded by brackets, as in this: $.waypoint([handler], [options]) -- does that mean the param is optional?
[12:15:17] <asher^> yes
[12:22:51] <MistuhKurtz> ty asher^
[12:28:47] <ordinaryman09> hello
[12:31:43] <ordinaryman09> guys, can u load multiple jquery scripts in a single page?
[12:32:49] <warrenparsons> ordinaryman09: Do you mean multiple copies of jQuery itself?
[12:33:14] <ordinaryman09> warrenparsons: not multiple copies of jquery
[12:33:47] <ordinaryman09> warrenparsons: so say like i want to have like 3-4 js scripts that uses jquery
[12:33:51] <ordinaryman09> in a single page
[12:34:12] <warrenparsons> ordinaryman09: So 3 or 4 .js files?
[12:34:20] <ordinaryman09> yah
[12:34:37] <warrenparsons> And you're asking if you can load all of them into one page?
[12:34:41] <ordinaryman09> yes
[12:35:54] <warrenparsons> ordinaryman09: Yes you can. If those files all rely on jQuery, you just need to make sure you load it first. Like so - http://jsfiddle.net/KhQ4c/
[12:36:45] <warrenparsons> ordinaryman09: It's very common practice.
[12:42:26] <ordinaryman09> warren parson, i see, I tried it but it deosnt work for me
[12:42:35] <ordinaryman09> maybe I did something wrong
[12:43:31] <ordinaryman09> so for each the js file u put  (function($) { at the beginning?
[12:44:02] <PIZDECCIO>    -    !      .
[12:44:02] <PIZDECCIO>   - http://impirat.com/
[12:44:02] <PIZDECCIO>   5 . !
[12:44:02] <PIZDECCIO> http://impirat.com
[12:44:15] <ordinaryman09> warrenparsons, hello
[12:46:00] <warrenparsons> ordinaryman09: That's not usually necessary.
[12:46:09] <Whirl3d> ordinaryman09, it depends on what the script is used for. If the script needs to handle something as soon as the document is ready, that is one way to do it. But if it just sits there to be used by another script, it doesn't need it.
[12:46:37] <ordinaryman09> oh got it
[12:46:59] <ordinaryman09> ya i didn't put $(document).ready(function()
[12:47:05] <ordinaryman09> thanks :D
[12:47:18] <Whirl3d> And if you are going to use the shortcut (function ($) {___}(jQuery);  make sure you put a ; before it
[12:48:12] <ordinaryman09> what shortcut?
[12:48:51] <Whirl3d> (function ($) {.......is a shortcut way of writing $(document).ready(   * for the most part.
[12:49:43] <Eviltwin> $(function() { ... }) is shortcut for $(document).ready(function() { ... })
[12:49:48] <ordinaryman09> oh ok
[12:49:54] <Eviltwin> (function($) { ... })(jQuery) is not
[12:50:22] <Whirl3d> Thanks for clearing that up. I always get the two messed up.
[12:50:28] <ordinaryman09> oh ok
[12:50:35] <Whirl3d> the second one is an IEFE, right?
[12:50:56] <ordinaryman09> also, any recommendation to make the touching smoother?
[12:51:01] <ordinaryman09> I feel like the delay is annoying
[12:51:06] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: That's right
[12:51:10] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: And those aren't specific to jQuery
[12:51:15] <Eviltwin> Where as $(function() { ... }) is
[12:53:05] <ordinaryman09> do u know how to make the touch event smoother?
[12:53:23] <Eviltwin> Make your code better/faster?
[12:55:22] <ordinaryman09> hmm the thing is that even when I don't have any functionality, the response for clicking event is slowe
[12:58:43] <ordinaryman09> have u try sencha?
[12:59:33] <BinaryKitten> ordinaryman09 sencha = a company
[12:59:33] <warrenparsons> Sencha is a disaster.
[12:59:41] <warrenparsons> Well, ext.js
[12:59:48] <warrenparsons> Or sencha touch.
[12:59:48] <EnlightenMental> had a question about animate().. I'm trying to make things "smoother".. so I tried setting fx.interval, animation speed, easing (linear Vs easeInOutCubic) etc.. no combination is getting me perfect results.  so I'm wondering if the size of the elements Im animating makes a difference?  i.e. 500x500 image Vs 20x20 images
[13:00:24] <Whirl3d> it's hard to say without seeing you code.
[13:00:38] <ordinaryman09> warren parsons, what do u recommend ?
[13:00:49] <ordinaryman09> I'm looking at magictouch right now
[13:01:20] <warrenparsons> ordinaryman09: What are you trying to do? If it's just adding touch events, an entire library like Sencha Touch or similar is major overkill.
[13:01:33] <warrenparsons> Framework, rather.
[13:02:07] <ordinaryman09> well, I'm building mobile apps using phonegap
[13:02:48] <ordinaryman09> so I just try to navigate between pages
[13:02:52] <warrenparsons> ordinaryman09: jQuery UI for one. It uses a lot of what you're already familiar with from jQuery.
[13:03:48] <ordinaryman09> yah
[13:04:08] <ordinaryman09> so my problem is when just trying to navigate pages, there's lags
[13:04:15] <BinaryKitten> jqTouch?
[13:04:48] <nibblebot> anyone know of a plugin/approach to allow HTML inside of a placeholder attribute?
[13:05:23] <ordinaryman09> a seems jqtouch is part of sencha :D
[13:05:28] <tsyrak> hi i'm trying to locate an issue using the ajax() method and UTF8
[13:06:00] <BinaryKitten> nibblebot for what purpose?
[13:06:11] <nibblebot> BinaryKitten: to have links inside or images
[13:06:29] <tsyrak> i read a php file with .ajax(), the file contains xml only
[13:06:39] <tsyrak> i set the header to xml and utf8 inside of the php file
[13:06:40] <nibblebot> BinaryKitten: seems like i'll need to fork one of the placeholder shims and extend it to support this :)
[13:06:56] <ordinaryman09> I tried the jqtouch demo
[13:07:00] <ordinaryman09> it seems slow
[13:07:02] <tsyrak> i then read data from that file usinhg $(xml).find()
[13:07:04] <nibblebot> and not use the placeholder attribute, but instead something like data-placeholderHTML
[13:07:07] <ordinaryman09> well I don't know if my phone messed up or what
[13:07:08] <ordinaryman09> haha
[13:07:10] <BinaryKitten> nibblebot? why html?
[13:07:20] <nibblebot> BinaryKitten: images, links!
[13:07:20] <tsyrak> everything works fine as long as my xml contains non-accentd characters
[13:07:40] <BinaryKitten> nibblebot put the src of the image, the location of the link
[13:07:43] <BinaryKitten> not the html
[13:07:45] <tsyrak> however it stops working (not sure where t exwactly but i cannot use the results from .find() anymore) when the xml contains accented characters
[13:07:50] <tsyrak> any clue?
[13:08:01] <nibblebot> BinaryKitten: they wouldn't render then...
[13:08:13] <nibblebot> i need them to render inside the input element
[13:09:57] <BinaryKitten> nibblebot you can't render inside an input element
[13:10:12] <BinaryKitten> unless you're talking about something else
[13:10:22] <nibblebot> like gmail does
[13:10:27] <nibblebot> in the reply box
[13:10:31] <tsyrak> how can i get more info about errors when usiong $.ajax() ?
[13:10:31] <nibblebot> 'click here to reply or forward'
[13:10:43] <BinaryKitten> nibblebot that's not a placeholder
[13:10:53] <nibblebot> true
[13:10:55] <BinaryKitten> well not a html5 placeholder attribute
[13:10:56] <nibblebot> but it acts as one
[13:11:08] <BinaryKitten> it's content in a div and clicking in there causes an action
[13:11:20] <BinaryKitten> which then replaces the div with form content
[13:11:28] <nibblebot> yep, i suppose that's the simplest
[13:11:38] <BinaryKitten> and also the most valid
[13:12:27] <nibblebot> yeah, it'll just have to have the same styles applied to the div/textarea and swap the div out on click and back again
[13:16:53] <BinaryKitten> nibblebot, use detach
[13:17:02] <BinaryKitten> that way you have the items in memory
[13:17:13] <BinaryKitten> and you can easily reinsert them
[13:19:31] <tsyrak> nvm server side issue
[13:21:16] <nibblebot> BinaryKitten: why not just hide them?
[13:21:33] <nibblebot> i like using a .is-hidden class
[13:21:37] <nibblebot> and toggleClass w/ a boolean
[13:23:17] <BinaryKitten> nibblebot because it's still there,
[13:23:22] <BinaryKitten> up to you really
[13:23:37] <nibblebot> yes, wouldn't toggling a class be cheaper than adding/removing from dom?
[13:23:54] <BinaryKitten> not really
[13:24:10] <nibblebot> hmm let me test that :)
[13:24:10] <BinaryKitten> still going to cause the browser to reflow the page
[13:24:17] <nibblebot> yes
[13:24:21] <nibblebot> but the dom tree changes
[13:24:26] <nibblebot> that has to cost some too
[13:24:37] <BinaryKitten> dom tree changes when you toggle class too
[13:25:21] <BinaryKitten> or at least that's my understanding
[13:25:25] <BinaryKitten> anyway i have to go
[13:25:27] <BinaryKitten> good luck
[13:31:08] <nibblebot> BinaryKitten: http://jsperf.com/detach-vs-hidden
[13:31:13] <nibblebot> lmk if my setup is wrong
[13:31:31] <nibblebot> 63% slower for a trivial elemtn
[13:31:58] <BinaryKitten> nibblebot bad test
[13:31:59] <BinaryKitten> .remove?
[13:32:06] <BinaryKitten> you mean removeClass
[13:33:01] <nibblebot> ew lol
[13:33:26] <nibblebot> what about detaching
[13:33:41] <nibblebot> ok fixed that.. hiding even faster now
[13:34:25] <MistuhKurtz> ugh
[13:34:30] <MistuhKurtz> has anybody used jQuery waypoitns?
[13:34:33] <BinaryKitten> nibblebot whichever though, it's still up to you which you want
[13:34:43] <nibblebot> hidden makes more sense
[13:34:53] <nibblebot> you don't have to test for the existence of the element in your view code
[13:34:55] <BinaryKitten> MistuhKurtz i would say yes.. but that would require me to answer more questions when i'm already meant to be gone
[13:35:38] <MistuhKurtz> I need to use multiple waypoint events for the same element. One for +100px offset (it's top edge is 100px from the top), and one for a -100px offset (it's top edge is 100px past the top)
[13:35:59] <MistuhKurtz> So, I have a waypoint set on a outerWrapper, and the other set on the innerWrapper
[13:36:49] <MistuhKurtz> But for some reason the -100px waypoint is firing when it's both +100px and -100px
[13:37:04] <MistuhKurtz> if I comment one of them out, so that there's only one defined waypoint, then it works as it should
[13:42:56] <RohanBhangui> MistuhKurtz: what are you trying to do wiht way points im confused
[13:45:08] <MistuhKurtz> RohanBhangui, I have multiple 'slideshows' that are full-screen width & height, stacked on top of each other. The client wants the slideshow to 'click' into place when its top edge approaches the top edge of the viewport
[13:46:05] <MistuhKurtz> So, I need to set it to 'fixed' position when it gets to 100px offset, and when it gets to -100px offset it needs to go back to relative positioning and start scrolling up again
[13:46:20] <MistuhKurtz> Here's the page: http://brookfield-la.epxhost.com/samples/carousel/
[13:46:35] <MistuhKurtz> I'm setting up a jsfiddle to try and isolate my waypoints issues, though.
[13:48:29] <Whirl3d> do the slides slide up and down?
[13:49:20] <Whirl3d> because you mayjust need to apply easing to the slides. That will give you the "click" effect you are looking for. I would suggest EaseOutBack when sliding up, and EaseInOutBack for sliding down.
[13:49:35] <MistuhKurtz> no, they slide from left to right. there was a js error that I just fixed on the page
[13:49:41] <MistuhKurtz> so if you refresh you can see how it currently works
[13:50:06] <MistuhKurtz> er fixed it again, heh
[13:50:37] <Whirl3d> If you handle the scroll event yourself manually, you can animate the content to it's "snapped" position
[13:51:06] <Whirl3d> you have 3 rows, correct?
[13:51:28] <MistuhKurtz> hmm
[13:51:35] <MistuhKurtz> correct
[13:51:51] <MistuhKurtz> Haha I think that's the best solution, thanks Whirl3d
[13:51:59] <Whirl3d> so, divide the height of the document by 9
[13:52:13] <MistuhKurtz> right
[13:52:38] <Whirl3d> check the scroll position each time it stops (mouseup) then scroll to the nearest whole multiple of pageheight/3
[13:53:18] <Whirl3d> So that would mean that if it was 1/3 of the way between page 1 and 2, don't scroll, 2/3 or more, scroll
[13:53:55] <MistuhKurtz> so, if you capture a scroll event and prevent default, the scroll bar will move but nothing will change on the page?
[13:54:25] <Whirl3d> I am not sure about that. It's not that you don't want people to be able to scroll.
[13:54:38] <Whirl3d> just when they release. snap to the nearest whole picture
[13:54:57] <Whirl3d> so you never have it partially obscured
[13:56:54] <MistuhKurtz> I see. Looks like I have some reading to do.
[13:57:14] <Whirl3d> gimme one minute and Ill give you the formula to try
[13:59:49] <MistuhKurtz> Here's the problem I was initially trying to solve: http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/3BUnT/1/
[14:00:23] <MistuhKurtz> not sure if it's a bug, or if I'm doing something wrong...
[14:22:16] <MistuhKurtz> aha!
[14:22:30] <MistuhKurtz> the innerWrapper event bubbles up, firing the outerWrapper event too
[14:24:50] <z0ned> does writing $("<img>")[0].src = "link_to_img.jpg"; ensure that the browser caches the image?
[14:29:59] <Whirl3d> no more than any other method
[14:33:07] <chovy> is there a way to access the title attribute value in a line like this: $("a[title]").attr('data-tip', this.title);
[14:33:31] <chovy> i want to copy title to data-tip
[14:37:45] <RohanBhangui> MistuhKurtz did you figure out your problem
[14:38:36] <MistuhKurtz> yes somewhat
[14:38:43] <Whirl3d> $("a[title]").each(function () {$(this).attr('data-tip', $(this).attr('title'));}
[14:39:12] <Whirl3d> and soem odd combination of })
[14:39:18] <MistuhKurtz> the inner element's waypoint event was bubbling up to the outer element, causing both waypoint functions to fire
[14:39:39] <MistuhKurtz> >.<
[14:41:14] <RohanBhangui> MistuhKurtz: is there not a plug-in for waypoints
[14:41:14] <smallfoot-> is .click() deprecated?
[14:41:23] <smallfoot-> should i use .on() instead of .click() ?
[14:41:36] <MistuhKurtz> yes I was using it: http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/
[14:41:58] <RohanBhangui> it is a very nice plug-in
[14:42:11] <MistuhKurtz> smallfoot-,  click is not deprecated, it's just a wrapper function for on('click', function(){ ... }
[14:42:13] <RohanBhangui> smallfoot: yes use.on instead of.click
[14:42:33] <MistuhKurtz> click won't use event delegation, it will use bind
[14:42:39] <smallfoot-> oh
[14:42:43] <smallfoot-> i dont know difference
[14:42:56] <RohanBhangui> what he said
[14:42:58] <MistuhKurtz> ?delegate @ smallfoot-

[14:45:28] <MistuhKurtz> jquery delegate is not deprecated, but it is superceded by on. On is a wrapper for event delegation or normal event binding. Delegate is strictly for event delegation. Use whichever one you prefer. Some might prefer the explicitness of $.delegate, others might prefer the all-in-one inclusiveness of $.on
[14:45:38] <RohanBhangui> ?.delegate
[14:45:40] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/

[15:06:51] <systemfault> How is jquery different than javascript?
[15:06:58] <smallfoot-> its not
[15:07:01] <systemfault> Just use a online javascript linter..
[15:07:05] <smallfoot-> jquery is a library for javascript
[15:07:08] <systemfault> There you go
[15:07:18] <systemfault> Then why do you even ask the question?
[15:07:28] <smallfoot-> because a javascript linter doesnt understand jquery
[15:07:41] <smallfoot-> it cant warn me about bad jquery practices, or deprecated use
[15:08:14] <systemfault> I see
[15:11:55] <cviebrock> so … how do i let $('a[rel=tooltip]').tooltip() apply to all current dom content, and future content (created via DOM insertion, etc.)?
[15:14:09] <MistuhKurtz> that depends on the tooltip plugin being used cviebrock .
[15:14:21] <cviebrock> it's from Twitter Bootstrap
[15:14:34] <systemfault> Is it the Twiiter Bootstrap channel here? :)
[15:14:44] <MistuhKurtz> lol i know right? lots of bootstrap questions
[15:14:48] <MistuhKurtz> #twitter-bootstrap
[15:14:58] <MistuhKurtz> well the bootstrap plugins ARE jquery plugins
[15:15:10] <MistuhKurtz> so I guess so systemfault :P
[15:15:23] <cviebrock> didn't realize they had a channel … sorry
[15:15:35] <cviebrock> i figured it was a generic enough jquery question :)
[15:15:36] <MistuhKurtz> cviebrock, I don't know if bootstrap's tooltips use event delegation or not
[15:15:46] <systemfault> MistuhKurtz: It doesn't matter… a library's channel doesn't inherits the support of all the plugins for it
[15:16:07] <MistuhKurtz> umm..
[15:16:41] <cviebrock> should I do something like $('body').on('load','a[rel=tooltip', function() { $(this).tooltip(); } );
[15:16:47] <systemfault> cviebrock: Not at all, we can only tell you it's about using event delegation, but.. since we don't know about the plugin… we can't tell you if it already supports that built-in
[15:17:05] <cviebrock> systemfault: fair enough … that gives me info to ask the twitter folks
[15:17:07] <cviebrock> thanks
[15:17:11] <systemfault> cviebrock: Since I don't know the plugin, I cannot tell for sure…
[15:17:19] <systemfault> cviebrock: I think it wouldn't work
[15:17:37] <systemfault> cviebrock: because $(this).tooltip() would only bind the event.
[15:17:41] <MistuhKurtz> Well yeah, I suppose #jquery is supposed to be about isolated jquery issues and not necessarily plugin issues, but there are lots of plugin questions in here. I dont' think it's a big deal
[15:17:51] <cviebrock> i'll try the other channel … thanks folks
[15:18:08] <MistuhKurtz> dangit i had something to say to him
[15:18:09] <MistuhKurtz> you scared him off
[15:18:10] <MistuhKurtz> :P
[15:18:12] <systemfault> :(
[15:18:14] <MistuhKurtz> haha
[15:18:19] <systemfault> I feel bad now :(
[15:18:45] <MistuhKurtz> it was just a gentle suggestion, don't feel bad.
[15:23:15] <MistuhKurtz> reading the plugin code, it seems like it already uses delegation with on()
[15:23:39] <MistuhKurtz> It'd be easier to figure out if plugins supported delegate by simply using delegate() instead of on(), which could be a normal bind or event delegation -___-

[15:32:04] <navaismo> Hi , im setting this http://jsfiddle.net/kWutY/4/ in order to create minimal tabs look, but the style also affect my button and my table, how can I set only for TABS
[15:32:20] <mouzone> Eviltwin: you still busy as fuck? no time to do a quickie for a couple of hundred bucks?
[15:32:36] <navaismo> If you remove the part of tabs2 and run again the button and table go back again to desired look

[15:41:51] <marcusatws> Hello: I'm trying to select an object like so i18nobj.string, but string (the key) is a variable that is containing the actual key. This doesn't work. What is the proper way of doing this?
[15:42:10] <marcusatws> If it makes any difference the object is coming from .parseJSON
[15:44:03] <[fields]> Hey, I'm curious for some advice.  Being relatively new to jQuery, I'm working on a decent size application, so far I have approximately 30 functions which get used, but I have deeply nested this inside of: $(document).ready(function(){$document.bind("deviceready",function(){ /* my whole app, so far with about 30 functions (and growing) */ }     should I not being coding in this nested...
[15:44:05] <[fields]> ...fashion, and instead keep the document.ready code very short and my 30 functions outside of the document.ready block?
[15:44:59] <smallfoot-> yeah
[15:45:05] <smallfoot-> or idk lol
[15:45:19] <smallfoot-> sry i know nothing about jquery
[15:45:24] <[fields]> smallfoot-: was that directed to me?  It seems to work fine, but also seems like the most spaghetti I've ever written
[15:45:28] <smallfoot-> ya
[15:45:48] <systemfault> marcusatws: We'll need more info :(
[15:47:17] <rush> marcusatws: try i18nobj[string]
[15:47:40] <systemfault> Ah.. string wasn't the name of the key..
[15:47:51] <kaidez> [fields] can u hook a jsfiddle for your code?
[15:48:28] <[fields]> kaidez:  I think I've answered my question, having 300 lines of code inside of document.ready is spaghetti
[15:48:39] <marcusatws> Yeah I tried that wasn't work either, I've found now I've got a bigger issue, for some reason jquery isn't properly parsing my JSON. I'll need to look into that first.
[15:50:33] <kaidez> [fields]: very true. yes, code broken up in sections/modules is the way to go. in both javascript and jquery
[15:50:45] <[fields]> kaidez:  my goal is to simply make a decent size application using jQuery, 1 .html file and 1 .js file
[15:51:01] <kaidez> [fields]: recommending reading #1: http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[15:51:45] <[fields]> kaidez:  I was nearing completion with a 5 .html page application and I spent 5 days scratching my head why on like page 4 of my app I lost all jQuery... so it has had me to redesign it all in one file.
[15:51:57] <hobs> kaidez: that is a cool page, thanks
[15:52:03] <[fields]> kaidez:  this is for a phonegap cordova mobile app
[15:52:36] <kaidez> [hobs]: np. awesome frigging learning resource
[15:52:57] <[fields]> kaidez, hobs, yea that is one very long document
[15:53:18] <kaidez> [fields]: in that case, recommending reading #2: http://jqfundamentals.com/ by rmurphey
[15:53:50] <[fields]> kaidez:  yea!  that's more up my alley
[15:53:50] <kaidez> [fields]: hmm. i think u can use #jquery-mobnile inside of cordova
[15:54:13] <[fields]> yes I am using jQueryMobile... however it seems to simply be a theming thing
[15:54:20] <kaidez> [fields]: yay!!!!!
[15:54:23] <marcusatws> OK I've got it working, I just didn't have quotes around the var that had the json.
[15:54:51] <[fields]> I like the theme though, and it is quicker to develop rapidly using the theming... so I like jqm.
[15:55:35] <marcusatws> Another question though, whats the best way to test for an non existent object. Right now I'm doing (obj.name === undefined), but that throws: ReferenceError: value is not defined
[15:55:51] <kaidez> [fields]: yes…easier than phone gap
[15:56:35] <[fields]> kaidez:  huh?  phonegap is pretty easy, I guess because I know javascript & DOM pretty well.  But it is time to go jQuery
[15:56:41] <[fields]> go = use
[15:57:14] <kaidez> [fields]: eh, in some parts it is.
[15:57:44] <[fields]> marcusatws:  wouldn't it be:   if(obj == undefined){  alert("you ain't gots no object!"); }
[15:58:03] <[fields]> marcusatws: or:  if(obj == -1) { ... }
[15:58:12] <marcusatws> Ahh nevermind! Must be friday, cause I keep making little mistakes all over the place! Thanks all for your help.
[15:58:35] <kaidez> knowing the DOM is a must, no doubt. but there's a lotta of things that JQM can do with little code
[15:59:40] <[fields]> kaidez:  again I don't see JQM as being anything more than some nifty styling
[15:59:43] <macer1> hello!
[16:00:08] <kaidez> hmmmm...
[16:00:11] <[fields]> kaidez:  let your href's effortlessly be pretty rounded buttons, for example.
[16:00:44] <[fields]> kaidez:  perhaps I am missing the boat, but I read the docs pretty thoroughly and it really didn't seem like a lang
[16:01:24] <kaidez> i haven't gone full-throttle into it yet, but things like .pagebeforecreate seem pretty "app-y"
[16:01:56] <dardevelin> hi there, i'm currently trying to set up a little quiz using jquery dialog, so i had the idea of using a for loop to iterate the hidden entries of the quiz, problem is, dialog doesn't wait for return and simply spawns all the windows in one go. (is there a way to prevent this ?)
[16:01:57] <[fields]> true
[16:02:11] <dardevelin> i'm extremely newbie when it comes to jquery
[16:02:48] <dardevelin> the for loop pretty much increments the index of an array which contains the different id's that dialog needs to pop up
[16:05:35] <TensaiNiNaru> thx EvilTwin, fixed my problem now with grabbing the json object, used PHP instead <?php echo $_REQUEST['jsoncallback'].'('.file_get_contents('http://server/data.json').')'; ?> Stupid of me not thinking of this :S
[16:06:13] <LordVorp> dardevelin: that depends on your "stop condition".  Does your logic just say, "for all these, do X" or does it say, "For all these: is it this one? if so, do X, else stop"
[16:09:45] <dardevelin> I have 6 questions that allow A,B,C answers, and i just want to track how many A's B's and C's where chosen
[16:09:48] <dardevelin> LordVorp, ^
[16:10:21] <LordVorp> alright. what's the trigger? and, nopaste/pastebin some code?
[16:10:27] <Eviltwin> dardevelin: It might be helpful if you could create a small demo of the flow you're looking for
[16:10:30] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ dardevelin
[16:10:31] <bot-t> dardevelin, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:10:45] <Eviltwin> Don't throw a whole website in there, but just a little code and maybe a button and a few divs
[16:10:45] <LordVorp> yeah, what they said. :)
[16:10:54] <Eviltwin> Or whatever you need to show us the idea
[16:12:11] <dardevelin> LordVorp, http://jsbin.com/ibuguv/3/edit let me actually redo one little part to better match the initial case i had
[16:15:52] <dardevelin> LordVorp, here is a better testcase -> http://jsfiddle.net/ZKghP/148/
[16:18:01] <macer1> I have an div and want to animate to so it goes up until it ends and is not showed :3
[16:18:04] <macer1> can anyone help me with this?
[16:18:18] <macer1> I can't calculate proper values for top/bottom in animate ;/
[16:21:32] <dardevelin> sorry need to go afk for a bit
[16:21:33] <dardevelin> brb
[16:21:40] <macer1> any help :|

[16:23:18] <abuayyoub> Hello everyone
[16:26:03] <abuayyoub> Hello, would anyone here be willing to help me with a javascript problem I am having with a wordpress plugin? The problem is basically I bought a plugin and its not displaying correctly. it apparently uses something called isotope. I installed the plugin and it dosent load. this is what it should look like:http://bit.ly/N6n4Ju and this is what it looks like on my website. http://boukay.com/stream-3/  I used this guys tutorial and plugin for jquery/js 
[16:26:03] <abuayyoub> this isotope thing http://bit.ly/KcHfnd but it still dosent work. I have almost zero experiance with Javascript or Jquery I really love this plugin i have been looking for something like it forever. if you can help me out at all I would be more than grateful.
[16:28:27] <aJacom> please
[16:32:34] <sven_oostenbrink> I am looking for an upload class that can do XHR uploads, that only has methods to open the file requester, and cancel uploads, that has events for start, end, cancel, and progress of the file upload and that has some extra methods / events for drag-drop file upload.. NO HTML interface whatsoever, I can do that myself around it very simple.. Anybody who could recommend me something?
[16:51:08] <iateadonut> prevAll('input[data-type=ppc_lastUpdated]') - what's wrong here?

[16:51:30] <iateadonut> looking for the previous input with the attribute data-type = 'ppc_lastUpdated'
[16:51:46] <iateadonut> all the cool kids DRINK dinner now.  it takes less time.
[16:52:38] <al_2000> http://jsfiddle.net/ucC8t/
[16:53:19] <al_2000> Why wont this work properly? Im trying to make all the dd's hide on page load, and only drop the one below its parent "#dropit"
[16:57:33] <LordVorp> dardevelin: I was right, your code says, "Do this for all of them, right now, in a row." and nothing like: "Do one. When complete, do the next one."
[16:58:30] <LordVorp> I suggest putting a callback on the dialog box's close() event... from there, increment whatever value, THEN open the next dialog (if there are any left)
[16:58:36] <dardevelin> LordVorp, how can i stop it then ? i mean even if i do something like wait_return = $dialog.dialog("open");
[16:59:03] <dardevelin> oh ok, let me search docs on how to do that
[17:06:51] <rukouen> al_2000: you need unique id's for your dd's
[17:08:54] <rukouen> al_2000: or you could do $('dd').hide();

[17:49:52] <dardevelin> LordVorp, can you please have a quick look http://jsbin.com/ibuguv/5/edit
[17:54:25] <bwq> abuayyoub: you need jQuery v1.4.3+
[17:54:28] <bwq> you have 1.4.2
[17:54:45] <abuayyoub> bwq? oh yea? Awesome how do I update it?
[17:55:21] <abuayyoub> bwq: you think this is the only problem? Thank you so much for taking a look
[17:55:25] <bwq> do you own the blog?
[17:55:30] <abuayyoub> yes
[17:55:37] <bwq> that theme you use
[17:55:40] <bwq> FolioGridPro
[17:55:44] <abuayyoub> yes...
[17:55:51] <bwq> it loads the jquery there
[17:55:56] <bwq> <script type='text/javascript' src='http://boukay.com/wp-content/themes/FolioGridPro/js/jquery.js?ver=1.4.2'></script>
[17:56:00] <bwq> see the ver?
[17:56:06] <abuayyoub> yes i see it.
[17:56:25] <bwq> can you remove that line from the theme?
[17:56:54] <bwq> load this:
[17:56:56] <bwq> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js
[17:57:26] <al_2000> How would I add HTML to an element in jquery? html retreives its html right?
[17:57:35] <bwq> .html()
[17:57:38] <al_2000> im trying to add an unordered list to a <dd class="name"
[17:57:51] <bwq> .append()
[17:58:23] <al_2000> .html or append didnt work for some reason
[17:58:37] <abuayyoub> Bwq: ok, so I should download this and replace /wp-content/themes/FolioGridPro/js/jquery.js? with the link you sent me?
[17:59:08] <bwq> not getting the proper element then, al_2000?
[17:59:13] <al_2000> ah
[17:59:15] <al_2000> correct
[17:59:18] <bwq> abuayyoub: sure, you could do that too
[17:59:29] <al_2000> i guess because $(this) was being called within a .get
[17:59:35] <al_2000> it wasnt getting the proper element
[17:59:47] <abuayyoub> bwq:  ok, do I just change that line in the file? did it say which file its located in?
[18:00:17] <bwq> i don't use wordpress, so not sure
[18:00:40] <bwq> abuayyoub: you could also remove that jquery.js
[18:00:45] <bwq> and just replace the file with the one from google
[18:01:07] <abuayyoub> ok, so I can just rename it to jquery.js ?
[18:01:10] <abuayyoub> and replace it?
[18:01:38] <bwq> sure :)
[18:02:08] <abuayyoub> that way I wouldnt have to go through all my template files to find that script.. ( I think )
[18:02:08] <abuayyoub> lol
[18:02:14] <abuayyoub> im gonna try it right now
[18:07:27] <al_2000> how would I remove an element and its contents if it exists?
[18:07:30] <bwq> heh, you still got errors :p
[18:07:47] <bwq> just call remove() on the element
[18:07:50] <al_2000> ah
[18:07:50] <bwq> or hide() if it's only temp
[18:08:03] <bwq> remove() is recursive btw
[18:08:07] <bwq> empty() isn't
[18:08:48] <al_2000> well thats how to remove it, but how would I tell if it exists? onclick, it adds the ul to it by default, but now i want to reverse the process so i can show,hide
[18:08:50] <al_2000> content
[18:09:31] <abuayyoub> bwq:  ok, it's done.
[18:10:17] <abuayyoub> it looks like it fixed the alighnment on the page but it's still not loading for me, is it loading content for you? www.boukay.com/stream-3
[18:12:12] <bwq> al_2000: you want to toggle it?
[18:12:23] <bwq> abuayyoub: yup, not sure
[18:12:28] <bwq> what were the install instructions?
[18:12:31] <al_2000> yes
[18:12:33] <bwq> did you only need jquery and that plugin?
[18:12:37] <al_2000> would I do...
[18:12:42] <al_2000> if( ($this).next('.fall ul').length > 0) ) {
[18:12:53] <bwq> you can just use .toggle()
[18:12:56] <bwq> to hide/show stuff
[18:13:13] <al_2000> but im showing it by using .get
[18:13:18] <al_2000> and then .html
[18:13:31] <al_2000> man I suck at jquery heh
[18:13:35] <abuayyoub> it apparently uses something called isotope. I installed the the plugin and it dosent load I used this guys tutorial and plugin for jquery/js and this isotope thing http://bit.ly/KcHfnd
[18:13:44] <abuayyoub> bwq:
[18:14:32] <abuayyoub> I;ve never heard of Isotope before
[18:16:41] <bwq> couldn't you just load isotype?
[18:16:49] <bwq> i mean, why do you need a plug-in just to load the .js? :p
[18:17:20] <EvilCrayon> Hi there, I have this codehttp://jsfiddle.net/Pwjyt/1/  that should rotate through the divs making each one appear on top and then start over. But it seems to only move to the second div and stop. Would someone mind helping me out a bit?
[18:21:59] <abuayyoub> bwq:  I might sound like an idiot but how would I do that?  I have the isotope.js file but how would I install it?
[18:22:10] <abuayyoub> do i need to install it or just put it in the folder ?
[18:22:18] <abuayyoub> i mean upload it to my server.
[18:22:56] <abuayyoub> Sorry, I new to web design, I am just learning HTML and CSS over the last 2 months Javascript is next on my list.
[18:23:28] <bwq> well, just load it in a script tag
[18:23:36] <bwq> but your plug-in loads isotype anyway, so it's np
[18:23:56] <bwq> what did the install instructions for your plug-in say exactly?
[18:24:04] <bwq> for the social stream wall
[18:26:56] <abuayyoub> bwq:  just to install, activate and use a shortcode on any page
[18:30:23] <bwq> well, you're not doing anything wrong
[18:30:37] <bwq> the shortcode inserts the css and js just fine
[18:30:47] <bwq> you got the proper version of jquery
[18:30:59] <bwq> and the same version of isotype as the site you showed earlier
[18:31:10] <LordVorp> dardevelin: you're not handing the "move along" bit quite right, I think.  You have assigned the FIRST dialog the correct handlers/callbacks. but as far as I can tell all the rest are "default", e.g. without the options (including the close() callback).  You can probably fix that by changing the selector at: var $dialog = $(match all the qname values!!!).dialog(....).  then the bottom click callback would be something like: $(qname[0]).dialog("open");    just
[18:31:11] <LordVorp> like you could replace: $("#test_pg"+didx) with $(qname[didx])
[18:31:14] <bwq> so i'd mail him or something
[18:31:52] <abuayyoub> bwq:  ok, I emailed them a few days ago and still got no response. They charge for tech support so maybe they sell it broken lol
[18:32:35] <bwq> lol :p
[18:33:54] <dardevelin> LordVorp, :/
[18:35:07] <LordVorp> dardevelin: I see what you're TRYING to do.  But what you NEED to do is: create 6 dialogs with the same callback, fire off the first one, then as each closes, fire off the next.  The "fire off the next" is the code in the close: callback.  You're almost there!! this is MUCH closer then your first example.
[18:36:51] <LordVorp> dardevelin: I'm slow today... I just now realized I could edit that paste myself.
[18:37:15] <dardevelin> LordVorp, i'ts ok, i guess the way to learn is trying :)
[18:37:20] <LordVorp> YES YES
[18:37:24] <abuayyoub> bwq: I just checked with firebug and it looks like half of the errors I had before went away, but I am still getting these errors
[18:37:26] <abuayyoub> txt717bk
[18:37:43] <abuayyoub> bwq:  whoops http://pastebin.com/txt717bk
[18:37:58] <dardevelin> LordVorp, I think my biggest trouble is being on how to individually "elect" each dialog
[18:38:01] <al_2000> how would I go about combining content.html(data) and content.toggle() ?
[18:38:15] <LordVorp> dardevelin: i'm working on it, just a sec. =D =D
[18:38:17] <al_2000> i want to toggle it and load the data, not just load it and have it immediately pop up
[18:38:31] <dardevelin> LordVorp, :) thanks for taking your time to help me out :)
[18:40:34] <abuayyoub> bwq: Port error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.
[18:41:22] <bwq> don't worry, that's a normal error in Chrome
[18:41:37] <abuayyoub> bwq: ok
[18:41:37] <bwq> oh, you're using firebug?
[18:41:38] <LordVorp> dardevelin: alright, it works!
[18:41:49] <bwq> i wouldn't worry about that error
[18:41:52] <abuayyoub> no that was from chrome
[18:41:54] <bwq> i get that on every website :p
[18:41:59] <abuayyoub> oh ok
[18:42:14] <LordVorp> dardevelin: I cheated a little, adding a css class to the individual ones so I could set all the dialogs with one selector.
[18:42:14] <dardevelin> LordVorp, ? i think you need to hit save so i can see it
[18:42:23] <bwq> yeah, i've seen the other errors too
[18:42:26] <LordVorp> dardevelin: http://jsbin.com/ibuguv/6/edit
[18:42:32] <bwq> but it's something related to the plug-in you bought
[18:42:38] <abuayyoub> bwq: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'scale' of undefined /stream-3/:1923
[18:42:38] <abuayyoub> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'scale' of undefined /stream-3/:2118
[18:42:38] <abuayyoub> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'imagesLoaded' /stream-3/:1944
[18:42:41] <dardevelin> LordVorp, ok thanks, let me check it
[18:42:42] <bwq> all the other scripts (its dependencies) load up fine
[18:42:46] <abuayyoub> those look like they are specific to the plugin
[18:42:52] <bwq> yeah, that's the plugin you bought
[18:42:57] <bwq> yup
[18:43:04] <bwq> hence why it's something on their end
[18:43:23] <abuayyoub> it's saying I don have enough room I think maybe I should disable Disqus on the page?
[18:43:41] <dardevelin> LordVorp, Wow, i feel dumb :)
[18:44:06] <LordVorp> don't.  you were almost there.  I'm the "haven't been hacking on this thing for HOURS" guy here. :)
[18:44:18] <bwq> where's it say that, abuayyoub?
[18:44:38] <dardevelin> LordVorp, yeah i kind learned all this jquery today
[18:44:42] <dardevelin> to do this
[18:44:54] <abuayyoub> bwq: I found it using Firebug ( or whatever its called for chrome)
[18:45:01] <bwq> ah
[18:45:13] <bwq> doesn't have to do with your resources, don't worry :p
[18:45:30] <dardevelin> LordVorp, Thank you very much :D
[18:46:17] <LordVorp> dardevelin: altho I suggest you wrap your behaviour here in a jQuery "ready" function, wrap ALL of that javascript inside this: $(function() { // your code!!! });
[18:46:22] <LordVorp> you're very welcome.
[18:46:52] <LordVorp> dardevelin: that "ready" will make your code wait to fire until everything in the DOM actually exists... :)
[18:47:09] <abuayyoub> damn
[18:47:34] <bwq> abuayyoub: it's sad that they charge for support when they can't even ensure their plug-ins work fine
[18:47:53] <LordVorp> dardevelin: also, notice I put didx = 0; in the "finished" section... without that, the demo would work once then not work after that.
[18:47:54] <abuayyoub> bwq, yea.
[18:47:55] <dardevelin> LordVorp, but now just to make sure I understand why your solution works opposed to what i had. The trick was in the selector,  used.
[18:48:50] <LordVorp> dardevelin: well mostly, yes: your selector was operating on just the first dialog.  so all other calls do dialog() were using default values (which doesn't include your callback)
[18:48:59] <LordVorp> (or your bookkeeping)
[18:49:31] <dardevelin> LordVorp, oh ok, that makes sense, like dialogs being each it's own object
[18:49:40] <al_2000> im out of the office for the night, thanks bwq for all your help.. i appreciate it
[18:50:00] <LordVorp> dardevelin: yes. and you wanted the same behaviour on all but were only SETTING that behavior on the first
[18:50:28] <LordVorp> dardevelin: I mean I only changed (not counting adding the class="quiz") like 3 lines of code.
[18:50:48] <bwq> np al_2000
[18:50:54] <EvilCrayon> Hi, I have this code that I'm working on that only works for the first div and then doesn't loop. Would someone mind taking a look? http://jsfiddle.net/Pwjyt/3/
[18:51:03] <abuayyoub> bwq: you wouldn't happen to know where I can find something simalar?
[18:51:16] <abuayyoub> oh i get another wierd error now
[18:51:19] <bwq> not really abuayyoub, sorry
[18:51:23] <dardevelin> LordVorp, :) i guess being a close friend with C didn't helped me much on this
[18:51:49] <abuayyoub> bwq:  zintro is not defined /stream-3/ (line 1945)
[18:52:05] <dardevelin> i never though that each dialog was an actual object. i was thinking more like dialog was a "function"
[18:52:14] <LordVorp> nononono!!!
[18:52:19] <dardevelin> more like a*
[18:52:28] <dardevelin> yeah i got it now. that's what killed me
[18:52:34] <LordVorp> dardevelin: the "objects" are the divs.  each one had a peice of CODE attached to it...
[18:52:57] <LordVorp> dardevelin: and by happy coincedence, it was the same peice of code for each. :)
[18:53:07] <dardevelin> humm :)
[18:53:52] <dardevelin> now i should probably code some stuff that automates the insertion of this kind of quiz
[18:55:14] <LordVorp> good luck!
[18:59:31] <dardevelin> LordVorp, thanks :)
[19:15:13] <Soleino^> Hello everybody, i need an advice about the best way to write, something that let the code after apply on all browsers except ie6 and lower
[19:17:03] <coldhead> i would put it in a separate script file and use those funky MS conditional comments to hide it unless IE lte 6
[19:17:22] <coldhead> this stuff http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html
[19:21:57] <RohanBhangui> coldhead: what is the largest screen i should design a site for?
[19:22:03] <RohanBhangui> sry picked random person
[19:22:07] <bwq> 4k resolution
[19:22:14] <RohanBhangui> in pixels
[19:22:21] <RohanBhangui> eg. (1024*768)
[19:22:50] <bwq> 3840x2160
[19:22:56] <RohanBhangui> really?
[19:23:09] <bwq> haha
[19:23:20] <RohanBhangui> just wnat to be sure
[19:23:25] <bwq> sure, if you want to see your site in a cinema
[19:23:32] <RohanBhangui> http://www.hobo-web.co.uk/best-screen-size/
[19:23:38] <bwq> i'd go for 720p
[19:23:38] <RohanBhangui> that wasnt much help
[19:23:40] <bwq> or 1080p?
[19:23:43] <RohanBhangui> lol
[19:23:52] <RohanBhangui> i know but im making abackground image in ps
[19:24:00] <RohanBhangui> and need to know px in height and width
[19:24:13] <RohanBhangui> and i am too lazy to use jquery to scale :)
[19:24:21] <bwq> yeah, just go by that chart
[19:24:25] <RohanBhangui> lol
[19:24:30] <bwq> ?
[19:24:41] <RohanBhangui> i love how they squeezed all big resolutions under other category lol
[19:24:50] <bwq> lol :p
[19:24:52] <coldhead> RohanBhangui: http://browsersize.googlelabs.com/
[19:25:02] <RohanBhangui> thx
[19:25:41] <RohanBhangui> lol my background image is 4032*304
[19:25:50] <RohanBhangui> *    4032*3024
[19:26:00] <RohanBhangui> i thin kthats good enough'
[19:26:03] <RohanBhangui> no?
[19:26:22] <Soleino^> coldhead, thanks but i want to do it with jquery
[19:31:07] <shoky> it has nothin to do with jquery
[19:36:55] <RohanBhangui> lol sry for question
[19:37:31] <RohanBhangui> i jsut assumed if you guys are jquery you may have dealt with browser resizing before css way and jquery way
[19:38:54] <RohanBhangui> Soleino: state your problem again
[19:39:00] <RohanBhangui> i kinda didnt understand from above
[19:46:15] <RohanBhangui> Soleino: state your problem again
[19:46:23] <RohanBhangui> sry i lost entire history
[19:46:31] <RohanBhangui> close chatzilla by accident
[19:48:17] <abjorn> HEY WHATS UP GUISE
[19:48:33] <coldhead> Soleino^: you want to use $.browser.version
[19:48:37] <coldhead> which is deprecated
[19:48:44] <abjorn> meaning you don't want to use it
[19:48:49] <coldhead> which is why people aren't rushing to tell you about it
[19:49:09] <coldhead> I KNEW THESE TWO PEOPLE, AND IT WAS A BOY AND GIRL, AND THEY LIKED TO HANG TOGETHER
[19:49:27] <coldhead> ?$.browser
[19:49:29] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery.browser - We recommend against using this property; please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support). jQuery.browser will be moved to a plugin in a future release of jQuery. Contains flags fo... http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[19:50:14] <gnarf> Soleino^: detecting browser version is a bad idea generally - whats the use case?
[19:50:31] <coldhead> the use case is IE
[19:50:50] <coldhead> top of the evening to you, gnarf
[19:51:00] <gnarf> not a good enough excuse, why do you need to know it is IE 6
[19:51:02] <gnarf> what breaks?
[19:51:04] <gnarf> what isn't supported
[19:51:17] <gnarf> likely, just testing for support of that thing is what you REALLY want, not testing for IE6
[19:51:21] <coldhead> i don't think Soleino^ is a best practicer
[19:51:25] <gnarf> ^^^ this is why browser version testing is bad idea
[20:06:16] <Soleino^> coldhead
[20:06:16] <b-ot> Soleino^, a brand new person to jQuery. Ignore at all costs!!!!!
[20:06:43] <bwq> lmao
[20:07:40] <Soleino^> so the situation is, i'm changing some fonts using cufon
[20:08:37] <Soleino^> IE6 doesnt support it very well, so what i want to do is to tell into the js to zap ie6 and lower
[20:10:19] <systemfault> cufon is so… 2005
[20:10:21] <systemfault> :/
[20:10:29] <Soleino^> lol
[20:10:43] <Soleino^> what is so 2012 inform me :)
[20:10:56] <systemfault> Font embedding with @font-face
[20:12:19] <Soleino^> and for browsers that doesnt support css3 ?
[20:13:36] <systemfault> It's originally a really old IE thing… that was adopted by other browsers
[20:13:57] <systemfault> I think IE5 supported them
[20:15:23] <Soleino^> okey i'm gonna try it on the next project, i've already digg about it, i thought it was limited to some specific fonts
[20:15:40] <abuayyoub> Hello, would anyone here be willing to help me with a javascript problem Iwith a wordpress plugin? The problem is basically I bought a plugin and its not displaying correctly. it apparently uses something called isotope. I installed the plugin and it dosent load. this is what it should look like:http://bit.ly/N6n4Ju and this is what it looks like on my website. http://boukay.com/stream-3/  I used this guys tutorial and plugin for jquery/js and this iso
[20:15:40] <abuayyoub> thing http://bit.ly/KcHfnd but it still dosent work. I have almost zero experience with Javascript or Jquery I really love this plugin i have been looking for something like it forever. if you can help me out at all I would be more than grateful. Also, these are the errors i managed to find from firebug... Can someone please tell me what these errors mean? And how I can fix them? http://pastebin.com/L8J65hXi
[20:16:06] <abuayyoub> I really need help, I cant offer cash but I can do something much, much cooler.
[20:16:08] <systemfault> You pick your truetype font then use something like the fontsquirrel generator to generate a nice package
[20:17:53] <coldhead> that's a big old wall of text there, abuayyoub
[20:17:56] <Soleino^> so no answer of how i can say with jquery," if any browser except ie6 and lower "
[20:18:02] <abuayyoub> sorry
[20:18:22] <abuayyoub> i suppose Is hould do it in parts next time :)
[20:18:45] <systemfault> Soleino^: $.browser ?
[20:21:22] <coldhead> Soleino^: we totally covered this, i linked you half an hour ago
[20:21:30] <coldhead> pay more attention
[20:24:21] <coldhead> abuayyoub: your best bet is to contact the people you have paid for this plugin
[20:24:25] <coldhead> they should be supporting it
[20:24:37] <coldhead> it's hard for us because we don't have access to the code
[20:24:48] <coldhead> i have no idea what zintro is or what it's supposed to do
[20:24:51] <abuayyoub> coldhead: I can give you access.
[20:24:56] <abuayyoub> yea me neather
[20:25:00] <abuayyoub> the problem is
[20:25:04] <coldhead> no, i don't have access to the original source code
[20:25:08] <abuayyoub> this company charges for support
[20:25:19] <tw2113> so that's how you spell "business model"
[20:25:22] <coldhead> jeez, they're not afraid to ask for money huh
[20:25:24] <abuayyoub> yea lol
[20:25:33] <abuayyoub> yea, i think they sell it broken
[20:25:40] <tw2113> then they should be told
[20:25:45] <tw2113> so they can look into it
[20:25:54] <tw2113> unless that's on purpose to get support $
[20:25:57] <pneftali> hi guys - is this way of traversing down to the first image acceptable or is there any better way of doing ? http://jsfiddle.net/MQvTv/
[20:26:11] <abuayyoub> i think thats part of their plan. Charge 15 bucks for the plugin charge 200 to "customize it"
[20:26:53] <coldhead> its hard for #jQuery to get enthused about fixing something that's broken out of the box and not free
[20:27:04] <coldhead> abuayyoub: are you sure you're including these scripts in the right order?
[20:27:10] * tw2113 holds out a thimble that's holding his enthusiasm
[20:27:28] <coldhead> i would guess the .wall script should be loaded after the other social stream script
[20:27:32] <abuayyoub> Can anyone recommend a similar type script? As you look at my website its a kinda grid thing and this displays all the social stuff in the in a wall
[20:27:32] <coldhead> worth a shot anyway
[20:27:50] <abuayyoub> coldhead: its just one zip file
[20:28:00] <abuayyoub> i upload it and its supposed to work.
[20:29:10] <coldhead> yes, i see they link in the same order you do
[20:29:18] <coldhead> in their demo
[20:29:23] <coldhead> which does seem to work
[20:29:29] <abuayyoub> yea, the demo looks awesome
[20:29:51] <abuayyoub> i love it because it works right along with my grid theme
[20:30:33] <Soleino^> coldhead, sorry but it wasn't the answer i was looking for
[20:30:35] <tw2113> </head>
[20:30:35] <tw2113>      </div>
[20:30:35] <tw2113>     <body class="page page-id-924 page-template-default">
[20:30:59] <Soleino^> i know how to do it in html, and my question is very specific, is how to do it with jquery
[20:31:24] <coldhead> OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE SOLEINO^
[20:31:32] <coldhead> ?$.browser
[20:31:33] <bot-t> coldhead, jQuery.browser - We recommend against using this property; please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support). jQuery.browser will be moved to a plugin in a future release of jQuery. Contains flags fo... http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[20:31:38] <coldhead> JQUERY BROWSER
[20:31:44] <coldhead> DO YOU SEE HOW THAT MIGHT BE USING JQUERY
[20:31:46] <tw2113> abuayyoub is this the url that should be using isotope? http://boukay.com/
[20:32:00] <abuayyoub> yes
[20:32:01] <coldhead> THERE ARE LINKS DEMOS AND EVERYTHING
[20:32:12] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  yes, thats the main domain.
[20:32:20] <tw2113> i see it working there
[20:32:39] <Soleino^> i already saw this before asking my question here
[20:32:40] <abuayyoub> HA!
[20:32:56] <Soleino^> if you're not able to read a question coldhead dont use your great letters
[20:33:04] <tw2113> loads new posts as i scroll, and it all fit to grid like the isotope thing
[20:33:29] <abuayyoub> oh the main page? no thats a different template
[20:33:37] <abuayyoub> http://boukay.com/stream-3/
[20:33:41] <abuayyoub> thats the social stream
[20:33:51] <abuayyoub> but its a far cry from their demo. lol
[20:34:02] <abuayyoub> its also displaying the wrong content
[20:34:11] <abuayyoub> but at least its kinda in grid form lol
[20:34:35] <tw2113> i see it pretty gridded
[20:34:36] <tw2113> and yellow
[20:34:50] <tw2113> but no images which i imagine were meant to make various sizes
[20:35:08] <tw2113> seeing as they're all the same dimensions right now, it's a fitting grid
[20:35:19] <coldhead> Soleino^: does this correctly identify IE 6 or lower for you? http://jsfiddle.net/jgMGm/
[20:35:22] <tw2113> Soleino^ you can't use $.browser to get browser info and check against with if statements?
[20:35:33] <coldhead> he can't, tw2113
[20:35:43] <coldhead> it's too hard :(
[20:35:51] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  yes, also its displaying the wrong content. The titles are on there are tags from the main page and the links are the links from my main page. What I did was changed the template on the page from default to "isotope"
[20:35:58] <abuayyoub> it should be loading my twitter feed
[20:36:03] <abuayyoub> and facebook, pinterest
[20:36:19] <tw2113> sounds like it's not necessarily a jQuery issue then :P
[20:36:22] <Soleino^> listen wisely, i dont have a good level in jquery still learning
[20:36:33] <Soleino^> something like if !== msie6 then
[20:36:51] <Soleino^> if if its not this f**king ie6 then do this
[20:37:02] <coldhead> did you look at my code, Soleino^ ?
[20:37:05] <coldhead> it does exactly that
[20:37:05] <tw2113> oh just swear already
[20:37:05] <Soleino^> my question is about syntax
[20:37:17] <tw2113> you'll feel better
[20:37:44] <coldhead> learning jQuery is not the same as asking the same question over and over in the hope that jQuery will magically have a feature work in the particular way you want :(
[20:37:56] <coldhead> you are going to have to apply your mindbrain to it
[20:38:02] <Soleino^> ok i'll leave a blank on the first if{} and then do what i want in the else {}
[20:38:05] <tw2113> *cries in the corner* somebody stop making coldhead type ":("
[20:38:10] <coldhead> it's my bad, tw2113, i dropped the mind bomb
[20:38:18] <coldhead> the f bomb, even
[20:38:26] <Soleino^> i could do it whithout asking .. was looking for some clean way to do it
[20:38:39] <tw2113> if (!$.browser === 'msie' && !parseInt($.browser.version, 10) < 7) { //Do awesome modern stuff }
[20:38:47] <tw2113> eh, maybe not
[20:38:48] <Soleino^> thanks tw2113
[20:38:48] <coldhead> i did it the cleanest way possible
[20:38:56] <Soleino^> that was exactly what i was looking for
[20:39:01] <tw2113> if ($.browser !=== 'msie' && !parseInt($.browser.version, 10) < 7) { //Do awesome modern stuff } ??
[20:39:06] <Soleino^> i think we had a misunderstanding coldhead :)
[20:39:08] <Soleino^> take it easy
[20:39:13] <coldhead> NO YOU TAKE IT EASY
[20:39:19] <coldhead> DON'T TELL ME HOW TO FEEL PAL
[20:39:20] <tw2113> may need to test where you place your !'s
[20:39:25] <Soleino^> ok we take it easy
[20:39:36] <coldhead> yeah i'm kidding, Soleino^, we're all good
[20:39:37] <abuayyoub> lol im pretty happy now that I never became a computer programer
[20:39:44] <Soleino^> light a candle and sing with me
[20:39:56] <tw2113> everyone learn how to ask this question
[20:40:11] <gnarf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oF5CdXvhlE
[20:40:13] <tw2113> "how do i make it so an if statement returns true that it's NOT IE6"
[20:40:38] <coldhead> if doesn't return a value
[20:40:39] <tw2113> on second thought, why are you bothering with IE6 still?
[20:40:41] <coldhead> WE'RE DOOMED
[20:41:07] <tw2113> there's a better chance that i'll get laid than there is that your user will visit on that version
[20:41:09] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11461339/where-can-i-find-documentation-for-classic-asp-that-uses-javascript-as-the-langu
[20:41:42] <Soleino^> lol
[20:42:05] <Soleino^> ie6 didnt dead yet
[20:42:25] <TomWij> Try running the FF version that was around when IE6 was around, HAVE FUN! :D
[20:42:42] <tw2113> and those still using it should feel pain when they visit your site with it
[20:42:54] <tw2113> you should have a huge middle finger displayed instead
[20:43:02] <gnarf> Soleino^: did you even read that like 5 messages i typed to you?
[20:43:21] <coldhead> you didn't type what he wanted to hear, gnarf
[20:43:33] <Soleino^> Hahahahaha
[20:43:44] <coldhead> he wanted if ($.msie_6_or_less) { do_stuff(); }
[20:43:53] <coldhead> other answers are irrelevant
[20:44:02] <TomWij> Haha... Firefox 0.8 :D
[20:44:27] <Soleino^> lol
[20:44:36] <gnarf> Soleino^: <!--[if lt IE 7 ]><html class="ielt7"><![endif]--><html>
[20:44:37] <TomWij> http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/releases/0.8.html
[20:44:45] <TomWij> Someone should try this... xD
[20:44:47] <gnarf> if ( $("html").is("ielt7") )
[20:44:51] <gnarf> if ( $("html").is(".ielt7") )
[20:44:55] <gnarf> Soleino^: ^^^^
[20:45:05] <tw2113> but that's not using jQuery
[20:45:05] <Soleino^> white flag
[20:46:08] <gnarf> still, detecting IE6 is like wrong by concept -- detect missing features
[20:46:16] <abjorn> I AM BORED
[20:46:23] <systemfault> NO!
[20:46:26] <systemfault> I AM BORED
[20:46:30] <coldhead> stop wasting his time, gnarf!
[20:46:30] <TomWij> abjorn: Then try out FF 0.8 and tell us what sites break on it.
[20:46:39] <coldhead> if i had ops i would kick you
[20:46:47] <abjorn> 0.8, whut
[20:47:01] <TomWij> That's the first FF version released after IE 6 xD
[20:47:09] <systemfault> coldhead: You are a bit insolent for your first day
[20:47:13] <TomWij> http://meyerweb.com/eric/browsers/timeline-structured.html
[20:47:23] <coldhead> YOU SHUT YOUR FLABBY MOUTH, SYSTEMFAULT
[20:47:28] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[20:47:36] <ngharo> @_@
[20:47:37] <tw2113> correct window
[20:47:39] <systemfault> :'(
[20:47:45] <systemfault> BBAAAAAWWWWWWW
[20:47:45] <tw2113> if it was the wrong one, you'd be saying "you open your mouth"
[20:47:49] <tw2113> *runs away*
[20:47:51] <coldhead> hahaha
[20:47:53] <coldhead> how rude
[20:48:03] <TomWij> Oh, netscape kept on for quite some time.
[20:51:18] <TomWij> Oh cool, it goes further back... http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/releases/0.1.html
[20:52:05] <TomWij> > If you install Phoenix on top of an existing Phoenix or Mozilla directory you will have problems.
[20:53:25] <systemfault> Seeing how firefox sucks today… we can conclude that the suckage legacy of netscape still lives on.
[20:59:59] <tw2113> firefox is just fine today
[21:09:20] <Sirisian> this might sound odd. Is there a standard way to do hashchange in jquery? $(window).hashchange(function(){ }); ?
[21:09:48] <Sirisian> Documentation doesn't seem to have anything for "hashchange"
[21:25:14] <Sirisian> wait does jquery not support any wrapper for hashchange?
[21:27:05] <Sirisian> oh wait $(window).on("onhashchange", function(e){})
[21:27:06] <Sirisian> ; hmm
[21:27:26] <shoky> $(window).on('hashchange', fn0-
[21:27:30] <shoky> fn);
[21:28:01] <Sirisian> hashchange and not onhashchange?
[21:28:22] <shoky> yes. but that just adds a listener for the hashchange event where it is supported
[21:28:29] <shoky> jquery isn't doing anything special
[21:29:04] <tw2113> :O
[21:29:08] <tw2113> jQuery isn't special?
[21:29:10] <shoky> you might want to use a plugin like ben alman's jquery hashchange, or bbq, or some others, aduno
[21:29:18] <Sirisian> works thanks shoky :)
[21:29:18] <shoky> it's queer
[21:29:20] <tw2113> $.shortbus ?
[21:29:52] <shoky> i like em tall
[21:30:50] <tw2113> man, now i need to go to github and search for shortbus
[21:31:52] <tw2113> hee, 7 repos, 2 in C#, and then one in Scala, Ruby, Java, and C
[21:32:16] <tw2113> and 1 unknown
[21:32:26] <systemfault> C# on github ?
[21:32:40] <systemfault> I thought codeplex was the c00l place for C# projects
[21:32:40] <tw2113> https://github.com/mhinze/ShortBus
[21:33:00] <tw2113> and also https://github.com/mortenn/ShortBus
[21:33:30] <systemfault> C# is pure sexyness
[21:33:46] <shoky> blarg
[21:33:53] <tw2113> if it walked by, would yu lean to the side, and go "i'd tap that" with a head nod?
[21:33:55] <systemfault> Too bad I don't use Windows
[21:34:29] <shoky> is dart worth getting into?
[21:34:39] <systemfault> Not at the moment I think...
[21:34:47] <systemfault> Too early to me.
[21:35:01] <shoky> bbbut then we'll be late for the party
[21:35:12] <systemfault> I can see a lot of enterprises jumping in the Dart wagon when it's released
[21:35:19] <shoky> me too
[21:35:45] <systemfault> Dart is not cool at all as a language so… enterprises will love it.
[21:35:46] <shoky> think i'll give it a go soon
[21:35:47] <maslo> hi guys is there any way to define the horizontal scrollbar position on an object? (Horizontal scrollbar made with overflow-x)
[21:36:40] <shoky> ?scrollLeft @ maslo
[21:36:40] <bot-t> maslo, .scrollLeft(): Get the current horizontal position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollLeft/
[21:36:54] <shoky> i think?
[21:37:09] <maslo> sweet
[21:37:13] <maslo> I've been struggling to get it to work
[21:37:16] <maslo> thank you guys :)
[21:37:21] <maslo> <3 you all
[21:37:25] <shoky> ;>
[21:40:09] <tw2113> should I feel bad for this? "foreach($dates as $foreveralone) "
[21:44:16] <BoomerET> I'm looking into forms/??? for displaying data from a database, I know I remember seeing some awesome ones for jQuery, but don't remember the name? Advice/hints/suggestions?
[21:45:06] <BoomerET> I just found one of them, jqGrid
[21:48:06] <brrc> Hello, I'm using Jquery, using setInterval to trigger display of Divs, but I've getting something wrong, because on the second div it doesnt set the right width, I have it live http://www.denisewhitesotogrande.com/new
[21:48:17] <brrc> If anyone could help I would appreciate alot
[22:05:04] <shoky> tw2113 i donno, my guess is yes
[22:15:51] <eip56> what is the construction class naming scheme for a jquery object... in other words like function contructor() {}
[22:17:13] <BoomerET> Are you using clearInterval(appropriateID)
[22:17:38] <BoomerET> or do you just want the same function running every X seconds?
[22:19:15] <eip56> well ok well im talking... like say in php if you use __constructor... basically talking abhout the constructor
[22:39:51] <MACscr> ok, so when a shadowbox like technique is used that brings a small box to the users attention and shadows out the rest of the page. what is used to do this css wise? Im not see any css changes in FF. I know im missing something simple
[22:40:07] <MACscr> the actual jquery plugin is nyromodal
[22:40:35] <MACscr> lol, nvm, finally figured it out
[22:47:34] <MACscr> anyone use that plugin though? Im having some crazy issue with basically the hidden div showing as a "modal" (is that the correct term?) and then when it close it, the it does go away, but shows back on the regular page where it was hidden before. Basically the display:block; never goes back to display:none; but special modal styling is gone.
[22:48:35] <shoky> eip56: what do you mean?
[22:49:10] <eip56> just talking about the constructor of an object is there a default... like in php theres __constructor
[22:49:55] <shoky> a default for what? constructors of what? what do they have to do with jquery objects?
[22:50:30] <eip56> im asking if there is a default function of an object that will automatically launch
[22:51:40] <shoky> functions only launch if you call them
[22:51:57] <shoky> when you say var myStuff = new Stuff()
[22:52:02] <shoky> you're calling the Stuff function
[22:52:10] <shoky> (amongst other things)
[22:56:52] <MACscr> if i have a complex script (with a lot written by a third party), whats the best way to find out what js functions are firing off when a link is clicked, etc? the jquery plugin for firebug?
[22:56:53] <shoky> eip56: javascript doesn't have classes, so your question just doesn't make sense. in php you have classes in which to define a __constructor method
[22:57:47] <shoky> MACscr: i'd use chrome devtools, there are many ways to tackle it
[22:57:47] <eip56> ok i guess im kind off relating php classes with javascript objects
[22:58:00] <shoky> eip56:  var myNewObj = {};
[22:58:06] <MACscr> shoky: well give me one way to do it =P
[22:58:08] <shoky> that constructs a new javascript object
[22:58:14] <shoky> and there's no special functionc alled
[22:58:15] <shoky> called
[22:59:57] <shoky> MACscr: you can check the event listeners for an element in the elements tab, you can record in the timeline while you click your link, then drill-down and see exactly what was fired due to the click
[23:01:27] <shoky> MACscr: you can inspect the element, then in the console run  monitorEvents($0)  to monitor all events
[23:01:46] <MACscr> i dont know anything about even listeners, so i guess i need to look at that first
[23:01:54] <shoky> you can use this bookmarklet: http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2
[23:02:30] <shoky> i suppose you can do that stuff in firebug too, i just dont like it much personally
[23:03:34] <MACscr> run in console? we still talking about chrome tools? man, i feel like a noob here
[23:03:43] <shoky> ?ftj @ MACscr
[23:03:43] <bot-t> MACscr, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[23:03:47] <shoky> enjoy
[23:04:32] <shoky> and yeah the console is part of the devtools
[23:04:36] <shoky> just like there's a console in firebug
[23:05:06] <MACscr> well i know how to view data in console and interact with it a bit, but ive never entered data into it
[23:06:14] <shoky> oh that's the funnest part about it ;P
[23:08:04] <MACscr> ah, had to scroll down on the right to see the event listeners options in chrome
[23:08:14] <shoky> yap
[23:10:02] <shoky> er sorry monitorEvents doesnt really help
[23:10:31] <shoky> i just learned about it today and was too eager to share
[23:11:05] <RonWhoCares> Hi Shoky
[23:11:08] <MACscr> ok, so now that found the even under Event Listeners, how do i get the timeline to record what all does what when its "activated"?
[23:11:17] <RonWhoCares> shocky I am back --- I need help again
[23:11:39] <shoky> MACscr: those were 2 different options for tackling it, i didnt mean that they can be used together
[23:12:39] <RonWhoCares> shoky  My problem / question is that I am unsure of why the JQuery script isn't being triggered.  I have made 2 attempts at this and also pasted the form at   http://jsfiddle.net/PX6VK/      The nature of the application is a ledger
[23:13:13] <shoky> MACscr: in the event listeners list you can just see the registered event listeners
[23:13:51] <RonWhoCares> shoky: I am trying to have the JQuery trigger based on the "Name Record Source" selection ... with the results populating the "Name" field
[23:14:04] <shoky> MACscr: and you can click the gray text pointing to the line of code that set the event listener, most likely it'll be in some lib like jquery
[23:14:35] <RonWhoCares> shoky: I use Firefox and have the Console opened.  There is no JQuery call in the console when I make the change.  Is there something obvious I am doing wrong as the reason why the script isn't initiating
[23:14:37] <shoky> MACscr: but just try recording in the timeline while you click the link, then stop recording and find the click
[23:17:45] <shoky> RonWhoCares: what exactly isn't working?
[23:18:04] <eip56> http://abqdata.com/index.php/newswidget
[23:18:09] <shoky> also, where are you inserting options into #account_reference ?
[23:18:12] <eip56> sorry wrong link
[23:18:14] <eip56> dont
[23:18:15] <eip56>  go there
[23:18:52] <RonWhoCares> shoky: No Jquery script is triggered when "name record source" is selected.   #account_reference  is the <select> associated with "Name:"
[23:18:59] <shoky> RonWhoCares: what does your ajax return? html?
[23:19:21] <shoky> the options?
[23:19:27] <RonWhoCares> shoky: When working, yes.  The output is a series of <option>
[23:19:35] <shoky> why $("#account_reference").val(data); ?
[23:20:27] <pandu101> if (page contains ajax_load.jpg image) {remove that sucker} -- how do I do this in jquery?
[23:20:36] <RonWhoCares> shoky: To be truthful, I thought this is what we talked about the other night for <select> populating
[23:20:37] <shoky> RonWhoCares: how do you know that no jquery script is triggered?
[23:20:52] <RonWhoCares> shoky: Because I have the Console opened in Firefox
[23:20:57] <shoky> so what?
[23:21:06] <shoky> you don't log anything to the console
[23:21:18] <RonWhoCares> shoky: No, but the calls always show
[23:21:31] <shoky> what calls? why would a jquery call show up on the console?
[23:21:35] <RonWhoCares> shoky: I will test this --- I will add something like 'Hellow world'
[23:21:46] <shoky> yes, that is how you program
[23:22:40] <RonWhoCares> shoky: The JQuery calls also show up as a "  POST http://administration.actsministrieschristianeva...n_evangelism_ledger_display_maintenance_area.php 200 OK 120ms   "
[23:22:46] <shoky> $("#account_reference").val(data); sets the value attribute of the <select> to your html string , btw
[23:22:57] <shoky> RonWhoCares: that is not a jquery call, that is an ajax request
[23:23:17] <RonWhoCares> shoky: Ok, my mis understanding
[23:23:51] <RonWhoCares> shoky: Without this showing in the console I don't believe the JQuery script runs
[23:24:09] <shoky> ok, your misunderstanding
[23:25:02] <RonWhoCares> shoky: I added a line of code and there was no change
[23:25:18] <shoky> throw away attempt #1 btw
[23:25:20] <shoky> use only #2
[23:25:48] <RonWhoCares> shoky: This data form is the result of a jquery selection --- "select which area of the ledger you want to maintain" type option list
[23:26:10] <shoky> that makes me tired
[23:26:56] <pandu101> Hi shoky: how do I do this in jquery?--> if (page contains ajax_load.jpg) {remove that img} ?
[23:27:23] <shoky> pandu101: $('img[src="ajax_load.jpg"]').remove();
[23:27:35] <RonWhoCares> shoky: I switched it back to # 2
[23:27:38] <pandu101> shoky: cool! Thanks :)
[23:28:16] <Eshu> please look into that issue http://imagebin.org/220717
[23:28:29] <Eshu> is anybody around
[23:28:33] <Eshu> ?
[23:28:40] <shoky> LOL
[23:29:36] <Eshu> please look into the link i posted
[23:29:43] <shoky> i am looking deep into it
[23:30:13] <shoky> it's making me question my principles
[23:30:26] <shoky> and god, and the bible
[23:30:38] <pandu101> LOL
[23:32:54] <RonWhoCares> shoky: does alert("") need a ; after it?
[23:33:07] <shoky> RonWhoCares: don't use alert, use console.log
[23:33:36] <shoky> and if you have to ask that question, then just put the damn semicolon there
[23:33:44] <shoky> unless it fucks up something.
[23:42:47] <Eshu> shoky: have you seen my link
[23:48:21] <abuayyoub> Hello everyone
[23:50:02] <shoky> Eshu: ye
[23:50:22] <abuayyoub>  im having a problem getting a jquery plugin to work on my website. From what I understand it looks like my main template and the plugin are both looking at the same jquery.js file
[23:50:28] <abuayyoub> Can someone help me with this?
[23:50:57] <Eshu> shoky: what is the problem in this?
[23:51:17] <Eshu> Cork: are you around?
[23:51:18] <shoky> Eshu: how would i know?
[23:51:52] <Eshu> shoky: i put a question above the image
[23:52:09] <shoky> you didnt
[23:52:10] <Eshu> shoky: have you read that
[23:52:12] <shoky> but
[23:52:34] <Eshu> but?
[23:52:36] <Eshu> When i am loading the page in dialog via load method is load all the content and events it is working first time but after close again try to open the dialog with same page the event are not working. I am getting this error . please look into that image.
[23:52:45] <shoky> you gave no info at all about what you're doing. i presume that code is generated by some library you're using
[23:52:48] <Eshu> http://imagebin.org/220717
[23:52:59] <shoky> and you gave no info about what library you're using, and you gave no code
[23:53:05] <shoky> so dont expect any help
[23:53:18] <Eshu> shoky: okey
[23:53:47] <Eshu> will pushing the code somewhere wait
[23:53:55] <MACscr> grr, its really frustrating when troubleshooting something and breaking it down into simple examples in jsfiddle and it working there, but not back in the original code. Whats odd is that im using the same logic on two different elements and they arent reacting the same way. AHHHHHH
[23:55:06] <MACscr> damn, i think i just figured it out
[23:55:51] <whomp> i need to animate an image to move from the left side of the screen to the center in about half a second. how can i do this?
[23:56:05] <shoky> ?animate @ whomp
[23:56:18] <shoky> whomp: with .animate()
