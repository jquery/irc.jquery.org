[00:05:56] <mytrile> Hey, guys. How can I select only td with certain class in a table ?
[00:06:29] <GoSox> it's such a battle getting it to work sometimes, but damn it's so cool once it does work!
[00:09:26] <mytrile> I can do jQuery("td.client_name") but I want to match another class like jQuery("td.[client_name|client_email]")
[00:10:44] <jaseemabid> What way is suggested by jQuery to handle templates? If I need to fill data into a template string from an ajax loaded json and put it into DOM, what should i do ?
[00:11:42] <jaseemabid> @GoSox Consider JSfiddle for sharing snippets.
[00:17:34] <burhan> when using .validate(), how to do chain dependencies? (only check fieldX if fieldY and fieldZ are valid)
[00:23:09] <GoSox> anyone have a good function for verifying if a string is a valid email address?
[00:26:13] <dazedandconfused> GoSox => you google around for a good regex for email validation?
[00:26:38] <GoSox> i'm actually digging through some old code, i have one around somehere
[00:26:59] <GoSox> but i figured if someone had a fresh, better one around
[00:27:29] <jrockjiggz> var email = /^([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.])+\@([A-Za-z0-9_\-\.])+\.([A-Za-z]{2,4})$/;
[00:28:08] <GoSox> oh wow i just found this massive javascript file i wrote maybe a year ago
[00:28:10] <jrockjiggz> if(reg.test(email)){ //do something }
[00:28:17] <GoSox> it would have been a hell of a lot easier if i wrote it in jquery
[00:28:24] <GoSox> it's ALL jQ's bread & butter
[00:30:08] <chjj> the ultimate quest for the perfect email regex
[00:30:22] <GoSox> the function i have isn't a regexp at all
[00:30:35] <GoSox> its a bunch of string functions
[00:30:43] <GoSox> i used it elsewhere and it seemed to work well
[00:30:53] <chjj> not as ridiculous/not as fun ^
[00:31:11] <dazedandconfused> times like that where you wish you could talk to your past self to figure out what you were thinking
[00:31:27] <chjj> the best part about it in js - regexes can only be on one line :)
[00:31:54] <chjj> so if you use one of those thousand character regexes you have to scroll horizontally
[00:31:59] <chjj> for email*
[00:32:27] <chjj> and its even more ridiculous
[00:33:58] <crab> <input type-email
[00:33:59] <GoSox> on this particular 'contact the webmaster' email form, i put a menu so you choose the subject of the email from a list, rather than 'free form'. One of the options is S.E.O.. I'm hoping all those ball-busting SEO "companies" in india will be stupid enough to mark their own emails as SEO!. After a month, if they do, and no one else marks real mails as SEO, I'm just going to have php not send the SEO emails at all.
[00:34:01] <GoSox> yippee
[00:34:01] <crab> s/-/=
[00:34:02] <mikunos> Hi guys I have a page with 10 checkboxes and two buttons to confirm an action. I need to disable these two button until one or more of these 10 checkboxes are checked
[00:34:08] <mikunos> how have I to do?
[00:34:08] <jrockjiggz> http://txt2re.com
[00:34:51] <crab> what SEO companies in india?
[00:35:11] <GoSox> the ones that email every webmaster of every website 15 times per day, asking if you want better search results
[00:36:20] <jrockjiggz> mikalv $('input[type=button]').disable().parent().find('input[type=checkbox]').is(':checked').parent().find('input[type=button]').enable();
[00:36:34] <jrockjiggz> i probably wrote that wrong
[00:36:40] <GoSox> crab do you really never get those messages?
[00:39:02] <dazedandconfused> alright time for my question, im using a variable number of forms, each with hidden inputs, which will be submitted by a click event. so one click event per form. how do i set that up (iteration or what not) to handle an undetermined number of forms
[00:40:07] <masklinn> does anybody have control of jQuery's Trac? I kind-of lost my login there and I don't think I'd registered an email address for it...
[00:40:30] <crab> gosox: hardly any, and only a handful from india
[00:40:51] <GoSox> thats odd, i get them daily on all of my sites, and 100% of the ip's i've tracked, have been from india
[00:41:18] <jayflux> in jQuery ui tabs can i only pull like a div from content
[00:41:21] <jayflux> and not a whole page
[00:43:33] <mikunos> jrockjiggz infact it doesn't work
[00:43:40] <mikunos> :)
[00:44:54] <mikunos> .disable is not a function
[00:47:02] <Ezek2k4> why $(this) doesnt works inside an autcomplete->ajax->success: function(){here}
[00:47:19] <Ezek2k4> i tried to do $(this).val(); and it doesnt works :/
[00:47:35] <Cork> Ezek2k4: cause this is overwritten in the callback
[00:47:49] <Cork> you need to store it before the ajax call
[00:47:57] <Cork> ex. var $self = $(this);
[00:48:06] <Cork> then use $self in the callback
[00:48:29] <Ezek2k4> ic maybe this was the reason why out test werent working before :/
[00:49:43] <JKarsrud> scope is a bitch
[00:50:29] <Ezek2k4> 2bad we cant slap her!
[00:50:33] <Ezek2k4> him watever it is
[00:52:56] <JKarsrud> it's what you're having issues with
[00:53:12] <JKarsrud> the fact that "this" is overwritten in the callback
[00:53:29] <GoSox> So I have a contact form with a page full of jQuery doing all sorts of neat stuff. Works great in standard browsers, fails completely in IE8. Fails as in jquery doesn't catch the form submit at all, or even watermark the inputs.
[00:53:30] <mikunos> this script doesn't work, why? $('.order').disable().parent().find('input[type=checkbox]').is(':checked').parent().find('.order').enable();
[00:54:23] <mikunos> any idea?
[01:02:37] <mbrevda_> [OT] anyone proficient in google analytics for a quick q?
[01:03:01] <JKarsrud> mikunos: disable() is not a function
[01:03:12] <GoSox> turns out the watermark plugin IS the problem, it fails epic-ly if used with a form who's submit button is named submit.
[01:03:20] <mikunos> exactly JKarsrud
[01:03:34] <mikunos> so how have I to solve?
[01:03:49] <mikunos> have you any suggestion?
[01:04:00] <JKarsrud> see ?attr
[01:04:00] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[01:04:33] <JKarsrud> and more specifically, the setter
[01:04:37] <JKarsrud> or write a plugin
[01:05:17] <mikunos> ok
[01:05:54] <bugo> how risky it is to use jquery-ui 1.9 in production. I need tooltip widget
[01:06:58] <Ezek2k4> Cork u still around?
[01:07:40] <Cork> sure
[01:07:51] <Ezek2k4> $self.parents('tr').next().find('input.amcharge').val('test3'); this is changing the input i wanted but in the next row
[01:08:31] <Cork> ya, wasn't that what you wanted?
[01:08:39] <Ezek2k4> yes in the same row
[01:08:41] <Ezek2k4> :P
[01:08:44] <Ezek2k4> not in the next one
[01:08:48] <Cork> ah
[01:08:55] <Cork> remove .next() the
[01:08:58] <Cork> *then
[01:09:16] <Cork> and you want closest not parents
[01:09:31] <aaronmcadam> oh god yes
[01:10:20] <Cork> your current code would fail badly if you ever had table in table
[01:11:13] <Ezek2k4> we did it we did it! you did it!! finally :P hehe
[01:11:20] <aaronmcadam> ?fail
[01:11:20] <bot-t> deferred.fail(failCallbacks, [failCallbacks]): Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is rejected. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.fail/
[01:11:44] <Ezek2k4> i second that scope is a bitch
[01:11:58] <aaronmcadam> scope?
[01:12:01] <Ezek2k4> if it wasnt for that it would be working like 6 hours ago
[01:12:02] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with u man
[01:12:04] <aaronmcadam> :D
[01:12:07] <Ezek2k4> lol
[01:12:10] <aaronmcadam> scope is awesome
[01:12:38] <Cork> Ezek2k4: that made things hard for you is dom relations
[01:12:47] <Cork> doesn't really have to do with scopes
[01:13:02] <aaronmcadam> yeah i think that's what he meant
[01:13:37] <Ezek2k4> not when u dont know that u cant use $(this) inside autocomplete<-ajax<-success
[01:13:49] <aaronmcadam> it's simple u can
[01:13:56] <aaronmcadam> just cache the this outside the callback
[01:13:59] <aaronmcadam> or use $.proxy
[01:14:01] <Cork> ah
[01:14:17] <aaronmcadam> _.bind, etc etc
[01:14:18] <Ezek2k4> yes cork told me that that was the problem
[01:14:21] <Cork> Ezek2k4: that is that functions set there own this
[01:14:30] <Cork> yes i thought you meant somehting ekse
[01:14:32] <Cork> *else
[01:14:48] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam: I said that scope is a bitch, because if you're not aware of it, it can be a bitch
[01:14:59] <aaronmcadam> oooh
[01:15:08] <JKarsrud> aka. when you don't know what Cork just said
[01:15:10] <Cork> ya, it can, and it's lovly when you know it
[01:15:11] <aaronmcadam> you mean the way this works
[01:15:18] <JKarsrud> aaronmcadam: indeed
[01:15:27] <aaronmcadam> ha
[01:15:31] <JKarsrud> and indeed to you too, Cork  :D
[01:15:36] <Cork> :D
[01:15:36] <aaronmcadam> once u get it, it makes sense#
[01:15:42] <Cork> ya
[01:15:49] <Ezek2k4> to celebrate this let flood prototype channel
[01:16:03] <aaronmcadam> for such an asynchronous pattern-oriented language like js
[01:16:08] <JKarsrud> exactly
[01:16:16] <aaronmcadam> callbacks ftw
[01:16:19] <JKarsrud> in C# it wouldn't make sense
[01:16:34] <aaronmcadam> you can do it
[01:16:38] <aaronmcadam> it has lambdas
[01:16:39] <JKarsrud> yes, you _can_
[01:16:40] <aaronmcadam> but yeah
[01:16:52] <Cork> what i find most fun is that go (a compiled language) has scope consept :)
[01:16:56] <aaronmcadam> I'm dealing with python guys who don't really understand
[01:17:14] <JKarsrud> I'm just saying that c#/non-js peeps in general are having issues with JS scope
[01:17:28] <aaronmcadam> go is heavily influenced by concurrent langs tho
[01:17:30] <aaronmcadam> like erlang
[01:17:31] <JKarsrud> but then you tell them how it works, and they're like "oh, ok, cool" :)
[01:17:44] <Cork> aaronmcadam: its heavily influensed by javascript actually
[01:17:54] <Cork> ops wrong nick
[01:18:04] <aaronmcadam> a language can have many heavy influences :p
[01:18:40] <aaronmcadam> python had something to do with it too
[01:18:44] <JKarsrud> no, only one!
[01:19:01] <JKarsrud> not many influences it can have, only one it is
[01:19:04] <Ezek2k4> im watching this serie spartacus damn good for the moment crap 13 episodes cant watch them all tonight :/
[01:19:22] <Ezek2k4> anyone saw it?
[01:24:13] <aaronmcadam> haha
[01:24:39] <natte|wrk> Eiler:
[01:24:41] <natte|wrk> oops
[01:24:46] <natte|wrk> Ezek2k4: yep it's awesome
[01:25:10] <blergh> Hi!
[01:25:37] <blergh> im making a web page where you can upload wavefiles into  a database, but I need to check metadata
[01:25:49] <blergh> can someone point me in the right direction?
[01:26:10] <randomnamn> I'm in need of help for JQuery + AJAX
[01:26:21] <aaronmcadam> ?ask
[01:26:21] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[01:26:37] <Ezek2k4> getting better
[01:27:28] <JKarsrud> blergh: metadata of what? The file?
[01:27:40] <aaronmcadam> why no metadata :(
[01:27:47] <blergh> yes, and to check if the right compression is used
[01:28:06] <blergh> would like to do this client side
[01:28:13] <blergh> if it's possible
[01:28:17] <aaronmcadam> something like the FileReader api
[01:28:24] <aaronmcadam> i think it's called
[01:28:36] <blergh> hmm, ill google it, thanks
[01:28:39] <aaronmcadam> HTML5 tho
[01:28:44] <blergh> ah
[01:28:48] <aaronmcadam> could be a polyfill tho
[01:32:22] <JKarsrud> maybe, but that's most likely done in flash or something, which is a dead tech now
[01:32:38] <JKarsrud> Could be possible with the File API tho
[01:34:17] <blergh> indeed, I'm reading the documentation now, thanks
[01:36:42] <subdesign> somebody meet html5 boilerplate and jquery ui problems?
[01:41:36] <Lichurec> Hello ;)
[01:43:36] <Lichurec> I'd need some kind of out-of-the-box thinking cos it seems I'm missing something
[01:44:09] <hrwath> so far you're missing a question
[01:44:10] <hrwath> ;-)
[01:45:03] <Lichurec> yeah, sure ;]
[01:45:53] <Lichurec> is there a way to traverse trough all elements according to a css selector but with option to gather all dynamically created / loaded elements?
[01:46:16] <Lichurec> I need to modify content of - for example $('.modifyme')
[01:47:27] <Lichurec> I can easily do that on domready, or whatever, but can' think of a way to do it for elements loaded via ajax calls (and no - I can not modify the ajax request to do some kind of "callback")
[01:50:55] <Lichurec> I assume that there's a way to do it via .live() / .on() but can't think of a way how.. I'd need something like $('.modifyme').live('load',function(){this.html('modified'+this.html())}); more-less
[01:54:53] <Lichurec> is this "clear" enough?
[01:56:07] <phryk> Hi there. Can someone figure out why the heck the images in http://celloro.b-onweb.de/ are jumping around like that? I tested that thing on 4 browsers and 3 machines yesterday and it worked flawlessly. However the exact same code manages to completely fuck everything up today.
[01:57:01] <phryk> http://pastie.org/2877028 This is the js in use (beltfeeder.js)
[01:58:05] <mekwall> phryk: Impossible it's the same code then
[01:58:21] <phryk> mekwall: It *is* that is what is so goddamn frustrating.
[01:58:44] <phryk> Firefox (main browser for testing) even has caching completely deactivatedâ€¦
[01:58:46] <mekwall> phryk: can't be... it's impossible for behavior to change if code hasn't change
[01:59:07] <mekwall> phryk: also, you are using jquery 1.2.6 which is more or less archaic...
[02:00:20] <mekwall> phryk: also, can't get any images to show at all on http://celloro.b-onweb.de/
[02:00:28] <phryk> mekwall: Comes bundled with drupal that way. Also : I thought that behaviour couldn't change too. That is why I have completely no damned clue where to pick up to fix this.
[02:00:52] <phryk> mekwall: Yeah, that it does now with webkit browsers (which also worked yesterday, but may have been a caching issue)
[02:01:13] <mekwall> phryk: well, I hate drupal and I will not help out with archaic jquery versions either, sorry :)
[02:01:38] <phryk> Oh wait a second, I think that's a permission problem.
[02:02:10] <threedot> hi
[02:02:30] <Lichurec> anyone got any idea
[02:02:31] <Lichurec> ?
[02:02:43] <FabyFaby> hi
[02:02:47] <threedot> why layerX and layerY been deprecated on webkit
[02:03:04] <threedot> how am i able to get relative position of object?
[02:03:30] <mekwall> Lichurec: you cannot listen after html mutations/manipulations
[02:04:55] <macvicious> hello
[02:05:55] <macvicious> can someone help me ? i get a "jquery uncaught typeerror cannot call method 'click' of null" when trying to bind an .click-event to an image (i am using PHP + I am a total beginner!)
[02:05:57] <FabyFaby> I have un a little problem, I have simply to copy the value of the textbox id= Text and to copy in a textbox id=Link, how to make?
[02:06:19] <mekwall> Lichurec: so if you don't control the ajax that is injecting the html then you're kinda screwed :P
[02:06:59] <FabyFaby> .... in realtime
[02:07:01] <mekwall> Lichurec: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery might help though
[02:07:31] <macvicious> i get a "jquery uncaught typeerror cannot call method 'click' of null" when trying to bind an .click-event to an image
[02:08:19] <macvicious> what could be my problem? I think the image ISN'T LOADE YET.
[02:08:30] <crab> that's your problem then.
[02:09:01] <macvicious> @ crab; i thought $(document).ready(...) would solved it, but it didn't
[02:09:17] <Lichurec> sh**t ;]
[02:09:22] <crab> oh, if you're doing it in there, then your selector is probably wrong.
[02:09:45] <mekwall> macvicious: use $(function(){ ... }); instead
[02:09:48] <mekwall> less chars ;)
[02:10:00] <mekwall> not that it would make any difference or solve your problem
[02:10:18] <mekwall> just sharing good coding pratices ;)
[02:10:20] <macvicious> I used$("img").click(function () {...}); and there is a image in my (php)-file
[02:10:52] <crab> less chars == good coding practices?
[02:11:18] <JKarsrud> less bytes to transfer
[02:11:21] <JKarsrud> == good practice
[02:12:00] <mekwall> crab: less chars to do the same thing is always better (as long as there's no performance impact)
[02:12:28] <arek_deepinit> is there a big performance improvement in 1.7 over 1.6?
[02:12:34] <JKarsrud> arek_deepinit: yes
[02:13:11] <FabyFaby> I have un a little problem, I have simply to copy the value of the textbox id= Text and to copy in a textbox id=Link but in realtime, can anyone help me?
[02:13:44] <arek_deepinit> FabyFaby: its very simple :)
[02:14:46] <FabyFaby> i am beginners
[02:15:51] <FabyFaby> Many beginners
[02:18:51] <mekwall> arek_deepinit: when it comes to events, yes
[02:19:11] <arek_deepinit> You mean improvement?
[02:19:41] <mekwall> arek_deepinit: improvement in performance for events
[02:19:53] <arek_deepinit> its very good:)
[02:19:57] <mekwall> arek_deepinit: just check the changelog http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/03/jquery-1-7-released/
[02:20:02] <mekwall> there's a graph there
[02:21:28] <arek_deepinit> mekwall: sorry for bother, and it looks like big boost to events
[02:22:05] <mekwall> yep
[02:22:15] <mac_vicious> Hi everybody! I have some a problem giving a simpel image a simple click-event
[02:22:32] <mac_vicious> my error is "jquery uncaught typeerror cannot call method 'click' of null"
[02:23:12] <mekwall> FabyFaby: var tbLink = $("#Link"); $("#Text").keypress(function(){ tbLink.val($(this).val()); }); <-- try that
[02:23:14] <mac_vicious> i am using a header.php, index.php, footer.php and can't acces the image that is in index.php for eventbinding
[02:23:22] <mac_vicious> any suggestions?
[02:24:09] <Oggu> How should I animate an element in on body ready while not hiding it by default (so it's viewable w/o javascript)?
[02:24:28] <Cork> wtf... propAttr...
[02:24:33] <Cork> ?.propAttr
[02:24:35] <mekwall> mac_vicious: PHP can't have anything to with it, and if it does, this is not the right channel to ask in
[02:24:36] <bot-t> Cork, #6793 (jQuery clone without innerHTML workaround for IE) – jQuery ... - Opened 16 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6793
[02:24:47] <Cork> <_<'
[02:24:51] <mekwall> Cork Bork!
[02:24:58] <Trisox> corky :D
[02:25:28] <Cork> mekwall: its a change in ui-slider in 108-7 - 1.8.16
[02:25:43] <Cork> uh... *1.8.7 - 1.8.16
[02:26:06] <phryk> mekwall: I think I have the error. The interval that calls bfNext persists, so when I reload the page I have 2 intervals meddling around with the imagesâ€¦
[02:27:22] <mac_vicious> @mekwall why am i getting this error if it isn't PHP you say?
[02:27:53] <mekwall> mac_vicious: 1) if it's a PHP error, then ask in ##php
[02:28:07] <mekwall> 2) if it's a JavaScript error, then it has nothing to do with PHP
[02:32:59] <mekwall> Cork: I believe its a jquery ui method that uses .prop if available, but .attr if not :)
[02:35:32] <Lichurec> hm.. thanks anyway ;)
[02:35:49] <Lichurec> Will figure out the way to modify the ajax call ;]
[02:35:52] <mekwall> Cork: function ( name, value ) { return jQuery.access( this, name, value, true, jQuery.prop ); }
[02:36:13] <mekwall> Cork: and it's defined by jQuery UI
[02:38:23] <mac_vicious> what would be the right order in your <head> concerning scripts like jQuery, my personal script, lightbox, etc...
[02:38:27] <Benn> Lichurec, When do you need to modify the html of the  element?
[02:39:32] <Benn> mac_vicious: You'd probably want to load all your libraries before your own script
[02:39:45] <Lichurec> Benn:  whenever one occurs in the page code
[02:40:09] <Benn> so what as soon as that element type exists you want to change it?
[02:40:22] <mekwall> mac_vicious: you'd want to load up jquery first
[02:41:09] <mekwall> mac_vicious: if you have a site that works without javascript, you should load them at the bottom
[02:42:05] <Lichurec> yeah; example: The backend pops out with something like <span class="modifyme" id="user:userid:whatever">Hi!</span> and I have to replace that with <span><a href="userid">Hi user!</a></span>
[02:42:22] <Lichurec> and I _have_to_ do that on a user side, don't ask why
[02:43:19] <mac_vicious> @ Benn : I loaded my script in this order and get an error ($(document).ready is not a function): 1. jQuery, 2.Lightbox-framework, 3.some script of Flash, 4. my script
[02:43:42] <Lichurec> problem is that Sometimes (in just few very specific situations) I get some "extra" elements like that loaded via AJAX request, on some kind of user action
[02:44:16] <Benn> Why can't you do it in the Ajax success callback?
[02:44:27] <Lichurec> cos I have no controll over the Ajax ;)
[02:44:35] <Benn> oh
[02:44:37] <crab> Lichurec: set a timer and do it in the callback ;-)
[02:44:38] <Lichurec> if I had - that'd be simple as hell
[02:44:58] <Benn> um.. that's a tricky one
[02:45:09] <hackeron> Anyone? - why does this table not render correctly in IE9 until I click+drag one of the columns? < http://monitor.xanview.com:3000/live
[02:45:40] <FabyFaby> ok, I try, thank you
[02:45:42] <Lichurec> I'll probably do a custom event and _force_ the guys that do the ajax requests to do a event trigger on success, but that's like 2 days of "asking" them to do so
[02:45:53] <Benn> Yeah
[02:46:00] <Lichurec> therefore I wanted to skip the "modify ajax callback" thingy
[02:46:02] <Benn> that was going to be my first suggestion
[02:46:19] <crab> this is the sort of problem like "i need to fasten this screw, only i have to do it with cheddar cheese, i can't use a screwdriver"
[02:46:27] <Benn> You could do it with a timer, but it'd be sloppy
[02:46:32] <Lichurec> very
[02:46:50] <Benn> Looks like you are going to have to get them to fix the callback for you
[02:47:00] <Lichurec> and honestly - I do not want anything to go in the bckground longer than it's absolutely necessary
[02:47:11] <mac_vicious> @ Benn: i'm not familiar with Ajax succes callback, any advise?
[02:47:11] <Lichurec> the app is already _heavy_
[02:47:34] <Benn> Sorry mac_vicious, that was aimed at Lichurec
[02:47:39] <crab> you can set a global ajax callback
[02:47:58] <mac_vicious> @ Benn ohwkey..
[02:48:15] <Benn> are you sure your Jquery file is loading?
[02:49:00] <mac_vicious> @ benn, yes because when i change the order of the scripts than it works (but than lightbox give problems)
[02:49:21] <Benn> Hmm, do you use a local copy of jQuery?
[02:50:18] <mac_vicious> @ benn, yes local copy (<script src="script/jquery-1.7.js"></script>)
[02:50:28] <Lichurec> doesn't lightbox by any chance modify the $ ?
[02:50:40] <mac_vicious> possible, don't know that lichurec
[02:50:58] <Benn> Shouldn't be an issue though
[02:51:10] <crab> lichurec: global ajax callback can't help you?
[02:51:23] <Lichurec> crab: we'll have a look on that
[02:51:39] <Lichurec> as I mentioned - I may simply force them to fix what they broke ;]
[02:52:20] <mac_vicious> @ Benn, when removing the script from Lightbox, everything is fine and working in jQuery (but it isn't feasable to remove lightbox...)
[02:52:43] <Benn> Odd.
[02:54:38] <Lichurec> mac_vicious:  can U show us the code?
[02:54:45] <FleetFox> If i have element like gallery(plugin) that i'm reloading via ajax is it okay to call plugin on that selector after loading?
[02:55:03] <mac_vicious> @ lichurec yes no problem, should i copy past it in here?
[02:55:12] <Lichurec> no!
[02:55:17] <Benn> use pastebin or something similar
[02:55:23] <Lichurec> use jsfiddle.net
[02:55:26] <Lichurec> or pastebin
[02:55:31] <Lichurec> or whatever
[02:55:45] <mac_vicious> k
[03:03:23] <Jeroenem> i can't seem to get this to work, anyone an idea? http://jsfiddle.net/deXVS/
[03:03:56] <Jeroenem> i've got an UL of .thumb's - on click i need to open a unique lightbox with the class .lightbox
[03:05:29] <mac_vicious> @ Lichurec , here is the link (sorry for waiting) http://jsfiddle.net/mac_vicious/AA5wA/
[03:06:08] <Lichurec> mac_vicious:  no prob
[03:07:51] <Benn> mac_vicious: could be prototype
[03:08:29] <Benn> can't you use lightbox with out prototype?
[03:09:36] <mac_vicious> @Benn I download and installed lightbox like the website told me, but i will leave the lightbox out for the moment. thx anyway Benn!
[03:10:09] <mac_vicious> @Benn, again thank you for your time
[03:12:06] <Lichurec> hmm
[03:12:22] <Lichurec> isn't there a jQuery implementation of lightbox?
[03:12:30] <Lichurec> it's not that "complicated"
[03:12:31] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[03:12:42] <aaronmcadam> it's not suitable for inclusion in a library
[03:12:44] <Lichurec> naah, I see he already left the room :/
[03:13:02] <Lichurec> jQuery-based-version-if
[03:13:08] <aaronmcadam> there's loads
[03:13:09] <Lichurec> s/if/of
[03:13:27] <aaronmcadam> fancybox is the one i always use
[03:13:31] <aaronmcadam> colorbox looks ok too
[03:14:35] <Lichurec> then why does he use the "oryginal" one, based on prototype?
[03:14:36] <Lichurec> dunno
[03:14:45] <Lichurec> aaanyway...
[03:23:39] <rethus> can someone tell me, why my slideshow didn't work anymore in other browsers than chrome? (see at bottom of page: erfolgsbeginn.de).
[03:23:50] <rethus> firebug in firefox don't show me any errors
[03:29:21] <rethus> i go tit
[03:35:18] <VeXii> hmm .reverse() dont work on jQuery collections?
[03:35:37] <hdon_> hi all :) i am launching two ajax requests. my server furnishes a message directing the client to redirect to the login page because i am not logged in yet. the redirect interrupts the second ajax request, causing another error, haha. how do i detect that my ajax request was interrupted because the browser navigated away mid-request?
[03:36:51] <VeXii> cant you just have a virable called isAjaxActive? and check on that?
[03:37:38] <hdon_> VeXii: i could, but my code which redirects the browser to the login page is not the only means by which this condition can happen
[03:38:01] <hdon_> update: i have just thought to simulate this cancelled ajax situation by hitting Escape in firefox while the ajax requests are being made. the results are not encouraging
[03:38:20] <hdon_> statusText says "error," readyState is0, status is 0, (maybe status==0 should be my test?)
[03:38:29] <hdon_> hey
[03:38:44] <hdon_> i typed "xmlhttprequest status" into google and it recommended "xmlhttprequest status 0"
[03:38:46] <hdon_> :D
[03:39:16] <VeXii> hmm dont think i bene in the sernario before :/
[03:39:37] <VeXii> why do you have multiple events when thay do redirects?
[03:39:54] <hdon_> hmm, apparently this also happens for other error conditions as well :(
[03:40:48] <karstenk1977_> Hello
[03:40:54] <sneakyness> I am
[03:40:56] <hdon_> VeXii: these are concurrent database requests. we like them to happen at the same time. i COULD add error-handling code that checks and sets a variable that indicates a page redirect is happening, but that would be pointless because this is not the only thing that can cause this to happen
[03:41:15] <hdon_> forget that i described the situation at all. simply i want to be able to detect when an AJAX request has an error because the browser is leaving the page
[03:41:43] <karstenk1977_> Please have a look and tell me, why the animation "MenÃ¼" doesnÂ´t stop as it should.  http://concept.tom-develop.com/charakter/?ua=|%20Mozilla/5.0%20%28iPhone;%20U;%20XXXXX%20like%20Mac%20OS%20X;%20en%29%20AppleWebKit/420+%20%28KHTML,%20like%20Gecko%29%20Version/3.0%20Mobile/241%20Safari/419.3%20|
[03:42:02] <hdon_> hmm.. maybe i just answered my own question.. how do websites warn you against navigating away from the page? is there a way to hook into that event without prompting the user if he wants to stay?
[03:42:39] <VeXii> well thers a window leave or change event if i remimber correct
[03:44:32] <hdon_> hmm another condition of status == 0 is that it indicates SUCCESS for ftp:// or file://
[03:45:09] <VeXii> if youre doing ajax i recomened using localhost or a live server
[03:45:11] <hdon_> VeXii: looks like window.beforeunload
[03:45:30] <VeXii> dont have good experince with using the local file system ^^
[03:45:46] <VeXii> karstenk1977_: whats if (!window.SkypeToolbars)? what i think it is?
[03:47:04] <karstenk1977_> where do you see this`
[03:48:04] <VeXii> in all the js files in the link
[03:48:41] <karstenk1977_> skype toolbar?
[03:48:42] <hdon_> VeXii: hmm, onbeforeunload is not a standard, and it is not implemented the same way in all browsers :\
[03:48:43] <VeXii> dunno if its this computer's extensions. doing work at a clients place and this machine is filled whith toolbars
[03:49:24] <VeXii> hdon_: http://api.jquery.com/unload/
[03:49:48] <hdon_> VeXii: :D thanks!
[03:50:21] <akshey> I am using jqueryui's range slider. I am using 3 handles in that. I do not want to allow dragging of any handle past any other handle. How can I ensure that?
[03:50:50] <karstenk1977_> can you tell me, why my animation doesnÂ´t stop at end of animation?
[03:51:06] <karstenk1977_> http://concept.tom-develop.com/charakter/?ua=|%20Mozilla/5.0%20%28iPhone;%20U;%20XXXXX%20like%20Mac%20OS%20X;%20en%29%20AppleWebKit/420+%20%28KHTML,%20like%20Gecko%29%20Version/3.0%20Mobile/241%20Safari/419.3%20|
[03:51:59] <karstenk1977_> ref to MenÃ¼
[03:53:21] <VeXii> where is the event for jQuery('#menu').trigger('mouseover')?
[03:54:16] <hdon_> VeXii: if you call trigger(), you must provide the event, or other arguments to the event listeners that are bound to that event
[03:54:29] <karstenk1977_> function show(id) {  jQuery(id).animate({     left: 0,   }, 2000, function() {     // Animation complete.   });  }
[03:54:30] <VeXii> sry it where for karstenk1977_
[03:54:31] <hdon_> VeXii: when the browser triggers the event, jquery does some magic, and you have an event
[03:55:00] <VeXii> well i see no Event handlers for the mouseover event
[03:55:14] <karstenk1977_> in the div#menu
[03:55:23] <karstenk1977_> onmouseover
[03:55:27] <karstenk1977_> onmouseout
[03:55:40] <VeXii> line?
[03:56:20] <karstenk1977_> 95
[03:56:29] <VeXii> ohhh....
[03:57:00] <HardPhuck> http://schuberthdev.gforcesm.com/index.php?id=90
[03:57:05] <HardPhuck> if i go quickly over the menu
[03:57:14] <HardPhuck> sometimes the animation doesn't complete
[03:57:25] <HardPhuck> and the menu 'hangs' out the background
[03:57:38] <HardPhuck> but if i go slowly, everything works fine
[03:57:45] <HardPhuck> how can i 'repair' that
[03:58:16] <karstenk1977_> is same issue as mine
[03:58:19] <HardPhuck> http://pastebin.com/cmbeu0aB
[03:58:32] <HardPhuck> this is he relevant part
[03:59:14] <VeXii> karstenk1977_: i think you shod look in to doing youre event handlers in the code and not markup
[03:59:21] <VeXii> makes its alot more clear whats going on
[03:59:54] <karstenk1977_> how does the trigger have to look?
[04:00:04] <VeXii> and do youre jQuery stuff inside the document ready. i susspect the trigger event is happning before all the things is loadet
[04:01:17] <VeXii> you can do $("#menu").mouseOver(show); insted of setting it on the html tag
[04:01:34] <VeXii> but i dont think that youre suppose to use mouseover and out at the same time ?
[04:01:50] <Axsuul> How can I click through an element? I need to click through #first to reach #second: http://jsfiddle.net/6yFeu/
[04:02:46] <VeXii> Axsuul: you need to nest the divs then
[04:03:05] <Axsuul> They can't be nested unfortunately
[04:03:07] <VeXii> if a click event is not handlet by a element it bubbles upwords to its parrents
[04:03:29] <VeXii> then bind #first to trigger #second
[04:03:37] <Axsuul> But there's no way to have an element ignore clicks?
[04:03:55] <Lichurec> PreventDefault()?
[04:04:04] <VeXii> well elements ignore clicks perDefault
[04:04:15] <VeXii> but it only gets send on to the parrent element
[04:04:27] <Axsuul> preventDefault() doesn't seem to work
[04:04:29] <VeXii> not siblings (that be a total mess aswell
[04:04:38] <Axsuul> e.preventDefault()*
[04:04:42] <closedbracket> Anyone know how I could make a bellcurve graph? I can't seem to find any libraries that do it. Rapahel and the like do bargraphs, but not an actual bellcurve
[04:04:50] <Axsuul> Hmm ok
[04:05:16] <VeXii> $("#first").click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $("#second").trigger("click"); })
[04:05:36] <JKarsrud> Axsuul: it bubbles up to the parent from the element that triggered the event. And unless there is some default action on one of those elements, it will just bubble up to document and disappear
[04:05:54] <JKarsrud> or if you've attached a handler on something
[04:05:56] <VeXii> then the first div do nothing and the 2. div gets it
[04:06:20] <JKarsrud> VeXii: don't think you'd need preventDefault() on a div
[04:06:58] <JKarsrud> there is no default action when clicking a div. And preventDefault does not stop bubbling
[04:08:49] <Axsuul> thanks
[04:08:58] <Axsuul> yea, stopPropagation stops bulbbing right?
[04:09:07] <VeXii> aximilation: http://jsfiddle.net/6yFeu/1/
[04:09:07] <Axsuul> but I find that it also has to return false for that to work
[04:09:31] <VeXii> dont return false
[04:09:32] <VeXii> !
[04:09:56] <VeXii> combine e.preventDefault() and e.stopPropagation(
[04:10:00] <VeXii> if you must
[04:10:34] <VeXii> e.preventDefault stops the browser from doing what i normaly wanner do (follow a link, submit a form etc)
[04:10:54] <VeXii> whith stopPropagation keeps the event from getting send to the parrent elements
[04:12:18] <Axsuul> hmm what's wrong with return false? i do that on links all the time
[04:12:33] <Axsuul> (ajax'd links that is)
[04:13:00] <VeXii> it is bouth preventDefault and stopPropagation but it can have unforseen consiqunses (spelling >_<)
[04:13:25] <VeXii> and it breaks the jQuery chaning
[04:20:08] <JKarsrud> Axsuul: http://www.bolsterweb.com/2011/01/javascript-e-preventdefault-is-not-return-false/
[04:21:47] <juria_roberts> How to select elements by name in jquery?
[04:22:01] <VeXii> $("CSS SELECTOR")
[04:22:09] <VeXii> ohh by name.
[04:22:25] <VeXii> $("[name=foo]")
[04:22:28] <JKarsrud> juria_roberts: $('[name="whatevernameithas"]');
[04:23:06] <VeXii> JKarsrud you need to write it like $('[name="+ whatevernameithas +"]')
[04:23:08] <juria_roberts> Thanks :)
[04:23:55] <VeXii> ohh nvm im Â½ sleeping on the ' vs "
[04:25:03] <JKarsrud> omfg, VeXii no
[04:25:15] <VeXii>  i know i know
[04:25:24] <VeXii> i told you i miss read
[04:26:09] <blackspotwiggins> i name all my elements "+ something +"
[04:26:14] <blackspotwiggins> and so should you
[04:26:29] <VeXii> looked like you where using whatevernameithas as a variable. (and stil then it shod be '" + whatevernameithas '")
[04:27:18] <JKarsrud> whut, no, it would $('[name="' + whatevernameithas + '"]')
[04:28:21] <blackspotwiggins> js should have interpolation :/
[04:30:11] <JKarsrud> blackspotwiggins: indeed
[04:31:20] <JKarsrud> it's not really hard to make, tho
[04:32:52] <VeXii> is my english realy That bad? o_O
[04:47:27] <Flawless> Hey guys. I can hide something like this: .hide("fast", function() {$(this).remove()})
[04:47:43] <Flawless> How can I insert a new element, .append(), and have it appear in the opposite way?
[04:48:29] <blackspotwiggins> Flawless, create the element with 0 opacity, animate to 1
[04:48:29] <VeXii> in the opposite way?
[04:49:22] <Flawless> I tried .append("....").show("fast"), but it just pops up
[04:49:29] <Flawless> VeXii: so .. no?
[04:49:40] <Flawless> blackspotwiggins: is that with .css() ?
[04:50:00] <VeXii> ahh make sure that its hidden before you append it then
[04:50:04] <JKarsrud> Flawless: add a class or some css to it before you append it
[04:50:25] <Flawless> Any recommended practice or good example of this?
[04:50:29] <blackspotwiggins> Flawless, setting opacity -> yes.
[04:50:39] <Flawless> I assume that I can't do .append().css('display:none').show('fast') ?
[04:50:42] <VeXii> what blackspotwiggins says ^^
[04:50:52] <JKarsrud> Flawless: better to set CSS before appending
[04:50:52] <Flawless> VeXii: How do I set opacity?
[04:50:52] <blackspotwiggins> i'll leave the exercise of figuring out the method for animation to you
[04:51:19] <VeXii> you can do .append(Element.hide().show())
[04:51:31] <VeXii> might wanner set the speeds ;)
[04:51:40] <blackspotwiggins> VeXii, stop saying shit you dont know
[04:51:44] <Flawless> But I have an HTML string constructed by a javascript html library
[04:52:22] <VeXii> 2 sek
[04:53:50] <VeXii> blackspotwiggins: http://jsfiddle.net/43uwg/
[04:54:03] <VeXii> works here. so whats the problem?
[04:54:16] <blackspotwiggins> does not work
[04:54:23] <VeXii> works in chrome
[04:54:32] <blackspotwiggins> i suppose everyone should use chrome then
[04:54:43] <VeXii> and works in firefox
[04:55:01] <blackspotwiggins> it does not on firefox9
[04:55:11] <VeXii> what error?
[04:55:25] <Flawless> Ah! I found a way
[04:55:26] <blackspotwiggins> it does not fade in
[04:55:46] <Flawless> $(".myhtml..").hide().appendTo(target).show('fast')
[04:55:56] <VeXii> ohh you wanted it to Fade
[04:56:02] <blackspotwiggins> pro reading skills
[04:56:04] <VeXii> http://jsfiddle.net/43uwg/3/
[04:56:06] <VeXii> happy?
[04:56:37] <Flawless> VeXii: odd, I could have sworn that didn't work last time I tried. But thank you very much :)
[04:56:42] <Flawless> blackspotwiggins: and thank you too
[04:57:22] <VeXii> Flawless: hope youre lokking at the updated it actly fades in
[04:57:52] <VeXii> ;)
[05:03:54] <lmatteis> hello
[05:04:00] <lmatteis> how do i add my plugin to the jquery plugins website?
[05:04:37] <blackspotwiggins> if you have to ask, the plugin is not prolly very good
[05:04:47] <lmatteis> which plugin?
[05:05:01] <lmatteis> and who do i have to ask?
[05:05:17] <Cork> lmatteis: http://plugins.jquery.com/user/login?destination=node%2F1823
[05:05:31] <Cork> or rather http://plugins.jquery.com/user/register
[05:05:51] <blackspotwiggins> as i said, if you cant figure that part out by yourself..
[05:05:54] <mekwall> lmatteis: show us your plugin...
[05:06:08] <lmatteis> hrm ok. http://lmatteis.github.com/jquery-report/
[05:06:37] <JKarsrud> bootstrap!
[05:06:38] <JKarsrud> :D
[05:06:41] <mekwall> yeah
[05:06:43] <mekwall> but ....
[05:06:52] <mekwall> that's just some kind of template?
[05:07:07] <mekwall> but limited to a table
[05:07:26] <lmatteis> well sort of
[05:07:31] <lmatteis> you dont have to define the markup
[05:08:23] <lmatteis> and data doesn't need to be consistent across rows
[05:08:32] <lmatteis> as you can see, it's able to figure out under which column to put data
[05:08:38] <lmatteis> so objects can be diverse
[05:08:52] <lmatteis> i needed it for myself, and couldn't find it anywhere... so thought would be useful
[05:09:04] <lmatteis> just thought it was easy to submit it somewhere on jquery's page, but guess not
[05:09:42] <mekwall> lmatteis: figure out? you are telling it in which column to put it by the name of the attribute?
[05:10:10] <lmatteis> hrm, by the key of the object
[05:10:25] <mekwall> no, its called attribute
[05:10:28] <mekwall> arrays have keys
[05:10:31] <mekwall> objects have attributes
[05:11:09] <lmatteis> i think the attribute is the value that is available at the specific key
[05:11:13] <lmatteis> mekwall: no, arrays have indexes.
[05:11:24] <JKarsrud> indexes and keys
[05:11:40] <blackspotwiggins> mekwall, explain Object.keys then :)
[05:12:13] <JKarsrud> lmatteis: just wondering; why is your plugin "class" called Plugin, and not some better name? :)
[05:12:19] <lmatteis> and they're usually not called attributes, but "properties"
[05:12:37] <lmatteis> JKarsrud: haha dunno, i just got it from jqueryboilerplate.com - was lazy enough to not care
[05:12:47] <JKarsrud> :)
[05:12:55] <lmatteis> JKarsrud: should probably change it, but whatever, it's internally defined
[05:13:08] <JKarsrud> ofc, it doesn't really matter, but I like code that makes sense
[05:13:56] <lmatteis> JKarsrud: does it make sense? not sure it's my first plugin
[05:14:17] <JKarsrud> It makes sense, but calling it something like Report would make more sense
[05:14:21] <JKarsrud> The pattern itself is awesome

[05:18:06] <bartmax> hi beautifull people!
[05:19:53] <akshey> In range selector widget of jqueryui, is there any way to get the index of the selected handle ?
[05:20:28] <VeXii> akshey: as in the new value of the handler?
[05:23:42] <akshey> I can get the value using ui.value but if say I have 5 handles and I move one of the handles, to make sure it does not go past the handle before it I need to know the value of the handle before it. To do that I need the index of the current handle
[05:24:33] <VeXii> okay think i understand. sry got no idea about that ^^
[05:24:49] <akshey> ok
[05:24:52] <akshey> np
[05:25:33] <JKarsrud> akshey: isn't there some kind of ui.element ?
[05:26:25] <JKarsrud> try a console.dir(ui) inside the handler and see if there is. that should have an index of some kind maybe. Or maybe the widget itself has, I don't remember
[05:26:37] <Myx0x3> is it possible to make jQuery Mobile not to break my long texts?
[05:27:03] <motill> Hi everyone, im looking forward to create my own complete custom jquery theme. is there a page that shows up every widget available so that i can test my theme easily?
[05:28:05] <lmatteis> JKarsrud: what category do you think i should file my plugin under?
[05:28:20] <JKarsrud> lmatteis: no idea, I don't even know which categories there are
[05:28:21] <lmatteis> oh there's a Tables category
[05:28:24] <JKarsrud> I ususally google
[05:28:28] <JKarsrud> usually*
[05:29:24] <akshey> JKarsrud: ui.element does not exist and I can't find index anywhere in $.ui
[05:30:03] <akshey> JKarsrud: It is not there in doc also: http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[05:30:03] <flu1> hi! i got a content div slider using the jquery ui sliderâ€¦ now i got a prob if im loading ajax content because i cant reset the sliderâ€¦.anyone knows hot to reset or re-calculate?

[05:32:14] <kollapse> Hi. What is an alternative to using `$(el).parent().parent().parent().parent()` ?
[05:33:17] <ravenzz> kollapse perhaps closest()
[05:33:49] <akshey> JKarsrud: Was ur last message for me? I did not get it
[05:33:58] <JKarsrud> akshey: yes
[05:34:00] <JKarsrud> it was
[05:34:38] <kollapse> ravenzz: Thanks, closest() works like a charm.
[05:35:08] <ravenzz> yw
[05:37:03] <akshey> JKarsrud: So, what do you mean by current target?
[05:37:14] <karstenk1977_> please can you look, why my animation doesnÂ´t stop???

[05:38:23] <akshey> JKarsrud: I hope it is clear to you, what I am trying to achieve. I have created range selector with multiple handles. I do not want a handle to go part its neighboring handles. So, when a handle is moved I want to check if its value has become equal to its neighboring handle and if it has, I dont allow moving it further. To know the value of the neighboring handle I need to know the index of the current handle
[05:38:49] <akshey> *go *past* its neighboring handles
[05:40:11] <JKarsrud> isn't that done automatically?
[05:40:16] <JKarsrud> looks like that in the docs
[05:41:29] <akshey> JKarsrud: nop. it is not. http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4387
[05:41:47] <JKarsrud> ahh, when there are more than two, I see
[05:41:52] <JKarsrud> well, I'm sorry, I don't know
[05:41:53] <JKarsrud> :/
[05:45:14] <kollapse> Between printing `<div class='something' onclick='myFunc();'>...</div>` 100 times with PHP and using jQuery event delegation `.on(event, '.something', function)`, which one should I use ?
[05:45:54] <akshey> JKarsrud: np. Thanks anyways :)
[05:46:39] <blackspotwiggins> kollapse, you trying to be clever?
[05:46:58] <kollapse> blackspotwiggins: I don't get it.
[05:47:27] <kollapse> I suspect event delegation would be a better solution ?
[05:47:30] <blackspotwiggins> yes
[05:48:49] <Myx0x3> is it possible to make jQuery Mobile not to break my lines? it just cut it and add "..."
[05:51:46] <dirkpennings> guys, anyone know why Firefox 8 triggers events too late? when I run this code using Firefox 8 I always get the previous value.. http://jsfiddle.net/dirkpennings/jyfMs/
[05:52:52] <VeXii> dirkpennings: same thing in chrome.
[05:52:53] <kollapse> Is there such a thing as "overdoing it" when using jQuery chaining ?
[05:53:23] <VeXii> dirkpennings: cant you use keyup insted?
[05:53:52] <xec> kollapse: yes, that's what the .end() method is for
[05:55:11] <CKIDOW> hi
[05:55:31] <xec> dirkpennings: http://jsfiddle.net/jyfMs/1/
[05:55:57] <CKIDOW> how to trigger that document.location changed?
[05:56:28] <dirkpennings> VeXii, xec: ok, wrong event?
[05:56:28] <CKIDOW> $(document.location).bind("change", alert("changed")); will executed only one
[05:56:35] * dirkpennings feeling kinda silly now..
[05:56:35] <CKIDOW> i trigger the change of the hash

[06:07:15] <johnathanb> How do I make autocomplete work with an array of objects?
[06:12:08] <bartmax> best/safe way to declare an array ?
[06:12:17] <bartmax> somehow [] is not working
[06:12:37] <bartmax> looks like im brain-blank today
[06:20:37] <johnline3> http://jsfiddle.net/v9HGL/
[06:20:46] <johnline3> old code works, ywa code not work :<
[06:23:10] <sahbeewah> can someone explain to me what it means to pass $ into a function
[06:23:28] <bartmax> sahbeewah: you are sending the whole jQuery object to that function
[06:23:28] <sahbeewah> eg. function( $ ) { ... }
[06:23:41] <sahbeewah> ok
[06:23:43] <bartmax> in that case,
[06:23:50] <bartmax> you are using $ as a parameter
[06:23:54] <bartmax> inside that function
[06:24:08] <bartmax> so you can pass jQuery object to function and inside that function use $ as an alias
[06:24:24] <bartmax> you can do function (sah) { }
[06:24:29] <bartmax> call that function with jQuery object
[06:24:41] <bartmax> and inside that function instead of $(this) you can use sah(this)
[06:25:14] <sahbeewah> oh okay
[06:25:41] <sahbeewah> that's interesting
[06:25:43] <sahbeewah> thank you

[06:27:18] <Guest50467> While in a .delegate() callback, is it possible to refer to the parent element? For instance, $('.item').delegate('a', 'click', function() { ... refer to the '.item' parent of the current 'a' ... }

[06:29:18] <HardPhuck> can i bind one element's height property to listen to another group of elements and adapt it's height?
[06:29:35] <HardPhuck> like i have a border below a dropdown menu
[06:29:40] <HardPhuck> which is positioned absolutely
[06:30:02] <HardPhuck> and i would like that border to move based on the highest list item in that menu
[06:30:25] <rroelofs> HardPhuck: That seems like the hard way.  You can't do it in css?
[06:31:11] <HardPhuck> no I can't
[06:31:28] <HardPhuck> because the element is absolute
[06:31:34] <HardPhuck> which is nothing i can do about
[06:32:15] <CKIDOW> how can I check if the jquery selector is a DOM object?
[06:33:37] <rroelofs> But you can't put a bottom border inside the absolute pos element?
[06:33:46] <CKIDOW> i guess document.location is not a DOM object right?
[06:34:02] <rroelofs> CKIDOW: Nope
[06:34:22] <johnathanb> Could someone take a look at this please https://gist.github.com/1373270
[06:34:45] <CKIDOW> so how to find out if a selector is DOM object?
[06:35:24] <Aamir> CKIDOW:  you mean if it exists ?
[06:35:26] <CKIDOW> isPlainObject ?
[06:36:51] <CKIDOW> no I don't want to check if its exists
[06:37:50] <CKIDOW> I want to check if i selected a real DOM object like an "a" or "li" ... or if it is something like document.location or anything else
[06:38:28] <CKIDOW> I don't want to parse the body to don't find the element... kinda slow i guess

[07:18:56] <brendanjerwin> The .html() function works past an IE bug which causes the browser to hang when large document fragments are set in iframes. Is anybody here familiar with that area?
[07:19:26] <brendanjerwin> It seems to have something to do with image tags.

[07:52:37] <DTrejo> Hi everyone, I have a file input, and I'd like to listen for when the file is chosen, and then automatically click the submit button for the user; is this possible? thank you!

[07:53:26] <DTrejo> oh hmm....
[07:53:31] <DTrejo> .submit(..)
[07:54:18] <eddiemonge> thats not good user experience
[07:54:22] <eddiemonge> you shouldnt do that
[07:54:35] <eddiemonge> what if the user chooses a wrong file by accident?
[07:55:03] <hdon_> DTrejo: GMail does it
[07:55:15] <kategeek> plenty of sites start uploading automatically
[07:55:17] <hdon_> eddiemonge: you can have a cancel button
[07:55:27] <kategeek> DTrejo, you might want to look into a file upload plugin

[07:56:19] <Chopps> has anyone here ever used this tooltip plugin?? http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/ ive implemented it with success, the thing is the text i need to display in the tootip is a list, and i cant make it show like i want to, it doesnt even take \n :( any help would be appreciated.. thanks
[07:57:02] <eddiemonge> hdon_: yeah and i still think its wrong
[07:57:06] <eddiemonge> google isnt perfect
[07:57:29] <hdon_> eddiemonge: i am not passing judgment, i don't care what anybody thinks and don't feel strongly about it myself
[08:00:53] <eddiemonge> Chopps: have you tried <br /> ?
[08:02:03] <Chopps> yes i have, it takes it like plain text
[08:02:15] <astronaute> hello all :)
[08:03:00] <astronaute> can someone please tell me what is the best way to avoid tab vertical offset while dragging in following demo : http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#sortable ?
[08:03:26] <astronaute> As you can see, while dragging, the tabs move verticaly, it is pretty weird
[08:03:44] <Chopps> im reading the code and it takes the text from the title of the element this.tooltipText = this.title; so i think thats why it takes it like plain text,
[08:05:23] <ccmonster> what's the best way use getJSON or AJAX or w/e without encoding api keys and such
[08:06:15] <ccmonster> because if I do the $.getJSON('baseurl',{k:v,accesskey:mykey},function(response){})   i will not connect because my api key is getting encodes
[08:06:17] <phlp> Chopps: if you look at the demos there is one with an image in the tooltip. looks like you can use bodyHandler to build an element to display, split the title text or whatever you want
[08:06:28] <ccmonster> which happens to have a ':' in the key, so that gets encoded
[08:07:47] <Chopps> ah i never saw that, i will check it out now..
[08:07:53] <ccmonster> any ideas phlp ?
[08:09:09] <black_warlock> hi whats wrong here
[08:09:32] <beefman> how do i pass an element's left margin to a mouseover callback?  how do i handle that information in the callback?
[08:09:37] <phlp> ccmonster: build a query string yourself and send it the string?
[08:09:45] <ccmonster> i guess that's the only way
[08:09:46] <beefman> err, handler, not callback
[08:09:53] <astronaute> anyone with some basic knowledge can help me remove that vertical offset in sortable tabs please ?
[08:10:07] <ccmonster> i thought maybe there was something more ...'elegant' i wasn't aware of
[08:10:09] <black_warlock> http://pastebin.com/FzrBvWRu
[08:10:16] <black_warlock> can you help me with this pls ?
[08:10:32] <black_warlock> why the text i digint in the input field doesnt show in the div ?
[08:11:26] <black_warlock> plix its 3 lines code =\
[08:13:20] <beefman> does eventData have to be in some particular format?
[08:13:54] <eddiemonge> black_warlock: .val()
[08:14:47] <eddiemonge> black_warlock: and you should use .text() instead of .html()
[08:15:27] <black_warlock> i ve tried
[08:15:29] <phlp> beefman: an object
[08:15:30] <black_warlock> but doesnt show
[08:16:52] <kategeek> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/KZKQ7/
[08:18:00] <beefman> phlp:  so on a mouseover, if i want to pass the current left margin to the handler, i use "marg = new Object(); marg.val= mydiv.css('marginLeft'); mydiv.mouseover(marg, function...) ?
[08:18:32] <black_warlock> thanks kategeek !
[08:18:56] <Pallet> Hi all

[08:19:04] <eddiemonge> black_warlock: wtf? thats what i said to do.
[08:19:09] <kategeek> black_warlock, it's just everything eddiemonge said
[08:19:21] <beefman> ph1p: but then i can't pass it the new left margin if i change it in the handler
[08:19:30] <eddiemonge> beefman: what are you trying to do?
[08:19:47] <ccmonster> bah, damn proxy is messing up my url request. weak
[08:19:54] <mikunos> http://pastie.org/2878627
[08:19:55] <Pallet> I know there's loads and I've been playing, but can anyone recommend a simple lightbox, not for images, I want to display HTML
[08:20:02] <mikunos> any suggestion?
[08:20:07] <beefman> eddiemonge: i have something like a filmstrip, and i want to move the item i mouseover closer to the center.  to do that, i have to know the current left/right margins
[08:20:37] <eddiemonge> beefman: do you have an example of jsfiddle?
[08:20:46] <beefman> eddiemonge: nope
[08:21:08] <phlp> beefman: just get the margin inside the callback
[08:21:10] <Pallet> anyone
[08:21:43] <beefman> ph1p: doh, of course...
[08:23:19] <atrigent> hey guys... why in this: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ demo does the draggable jump a little bit when dragging to the edge of the dragging area?
[08:24:13] <iman> how can I make an element readonly with jquery ? a input element for example
[08:24:41] <phlp> atrigent: i dont see any jump
[08:24:45] <kategeek> iman .attr('readonly', 'readonly')
[08:24:55] <eddiemonge> mikunos: i dont know what you are trying to do but here is some optimizations http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/jydsn/1/
[08:25:09] <iman> kategeek, $('#activeEmail').attr('readonly', 'readonly');, but not applied
[08:25:12] <atrigent> phlp: when you drag it to the bottom of the dragging area and the scrolling starts?
[08:25:18] <Chopps> phlp, i cant make it work, im adding the tooltip to a select, it works with normal tooltip, but not with bodyhandler, i dont know how to implement it in the select
[08:25:18] <eddiemonge> Pallet: you could use jqueryui
[08:25:48] <eddiemonge> iman: try prop instead of attr
[08:26:35] <mikunos> eddiemonge I would like to add the possibility to the user to go over the title and scroll down the sub menu instead of the click on the "v"
[08:27:05] <phlp> atrigent: i think i see what you mean if i do it quickly there is a jump. it's because the browser is scolling down like if you select text and drag down
[08:27:32] <kategeek> iman: seems to work for me with attr and prop http://jsfiddle.net/fRct2/
[08:27:42] <eddiemonge> mikunos: html would help
[08:27:48] <atrigent> no, that's not what I'm seeing
[08:28:15] <mikunos> eddiemonge: http://demo.shineisp.com/
[08:28:20] <atrigent> when I drag down a certain amount, the draggable jumps up
[08:28:29] <mikunos> eddiemonge: look at the category menu
[08:28:41] <iman> kategeek, it may seem odd, because just prop works with me
[08:28:42] <mikunos> eddiemonge: can u see it?
[08:28:48] <iman> eddiemonge, thanks
[08:28:52] <phlp> atrigent: and is the scrollbar scrolled to the top or has it scrolled down?
[08:29:26] <eddiemonge> mikunos: what category menu?
[08:29:47] <mikunos> under the logo
[08:30:08] <crab> suppose i'm using jquery, jquery-ui, and a bunch of plugins on a site.
[08:30:39] <atrigent> phlp: it starts when the scrollbar starts going down, not just when the element goes below the bottom edge
[08:30:46] <crab> right now i put all those plus my javascript into a single file, minify it, and serve it with content-encoding: gzip. the total size is ~70kb that way.
[08:31:15] <crab> at what point does it make more sense to have multiple files and deal with the extra complexity of require.js or similar?
[08:31:29] <crab> or perhaps "how do i figure out that point?"
[08:31:39] <phlp> atrigent: that's what i'm saying you are dragging and scrolling at the same time
[08:31:41] <beefman> ok, so suppose i want to apply the same thing to several items..  i write the function once, and i want to pass it 'this' each time.  do i have to stick 'this' in the parameter list when i define it, or can i refer to 'this' in the function even though it's not in the parameter list, but is passed by mouseover?
[08:32:07] <crab> beefman: you can refer to this even though it's not in the parameter list
[08:32:15] <beefman> crab: ty
[08:32:25] <iman> kategeek, is it possible to disable all element inner a container like div ?
[08:32:50] <crab> (also, is require.js still the thing to use?)
[08:33:10] <crab> i don't understand all this AMD stuff. i feel like a dinosaur.
[08:33:57] <kategeek> iman $('div input') ?
[08:34:06] <atrigent> phlp: I don't have to do it "quickly" to see it, and it's not just a momentary jump - it moves up for as long as it is below the edge by a certain amount
[08:34:13] <iman> anything in a dive
[08:34:17] <iman> div *
[08:34:31] <atrigent> and there is definitely no analog to this behavior in any other dragging behavior I've seen
[08:35:09] <kategeek> iman, exactly
[08:35:13] <atrigent> I guess it is happening while the scrolling is happening
[08:35:18] <atrigent> but it still doesn't make any sense
[08:35:31] <iman> kategeek, radio input textarea button
[08:35:38] <iman> kategeek, how can i do it
[08:35:43] <majd> is there a jquery library that formats JSON so that i can put it in a <code> tag and a user would be able to read it?
[08:36:02] <majd> something that does at least indentation
[08:36:19] <kategeek> iman, $('div *')
[08:37:08] <majd> colour coding would be great too
[08:37:22] <phlp> atrigent: it doesnt know to update the position until after the scroll. it moves up because you scroll down then it updates the position where it should be because you are dragging. try dragging and using the scroll wheel
[08:37:30] <iman> kategeek, woooow, good job, it's rich idea, thanks
[08:38:44] <louigi> hey guys! I made a site which has an ajax call implemented through post. works fine in FF, but not in IE
[08:39:00] <louigi> any general info on ajax call with jQuery 1.7 and IE8?
[08:40:05] <eddiemonge> ?demo @ louigi
[08:40:06] <bot-t> louigi, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[08:40:10] <atrigent> phlp: using the scroll wheel while dragging causes the draggable to move and then reposition when the mouse is moved again
[08:40:13] <atrigent> which is not the same
[08:40:16] <atrigent> never mind
[08:40:39] <phlp> its not the same because the mouse isnt moving when you scroll with the scroll wheel. it is when you are dragging down
[08:40:52] <BillCriswell> When doing conditional loading of javascript, do you guys detect the width of the actual device or just the width of the browser?
[08:41:09] <louigi> bot-t, easily. here is the link: www.louigiverona.ru/ch
[08:41:09] <bot-t> louigi, Stored "easily. here".
[08:41:25] <louigi> ah, I guess it is a bot
[08:41:56] <louigi> here is the link: www.louigiverona.ru/ch Just try to select a value from a select drop down list
[08:42:18] <louigi> one of the columns shows the number - it is done by just putting a fixed value there (100)
[08:42:26] <louigi> the rest of the columns stay empty
[08:42:38] <louigi> but the values should come from database
[08:42:50] <eddiemonge> louigi: get rid of the ajaxsetup stuff. what is that there for?
[08:43:16] <louigi> eddiemonge, got rid
[08:43:24] <louigi> it was just some advice on the web, did not help
[08:43:29] <atrigent> phlp: moving the draggable around while scrolling with the scroll wheel is also not the same
[08:44:29] <eddiemonge> louigi: are you really returning xml?
[08:44:43] <louigi> eddict, yes, I can paste it here. it works fine in FF
[08:44:47] <phlp> atrigent: ok you're right at some level scrolling with the scroll wheel and scrolling by dragging are not the same. the point was that the draggable gets left behind when you scroll
[08:44:57] <louigi> eddiemonge, yes, I can paste it here
[08:45:04] <aaronmcadam> plz don't
[08:45:18] <louigi> hehe
[08:45:23] <aaronmcadam> ?p
[08:45:23] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:45:25] <louigi> well, not here but to pastebin or whatever
[08:45:29] <eddiemonge> louigi: you should add   ,'xml'  to your post
[08:45:29] <aaronmcadam> heh cool
[08:45:46] <louigi> eddiemonge, will try now
[08:46:21] <louigi> eddiemonge, where though? can you write how? there is a function(xml)
[08:46:56] <aaronmcadam> the dataType
[08:46:57] <beefman> crab: now when i define the function, it's executing, and i get the error "this.css" is not a function.  i don't know why it's executing
[08:47:08] <aaronmcadam> ?post @ louigi
[08:47:08] <bot-t> louigi, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[08:47:54] <louigi> aaronmcadam, reading...
[08:48:05] <aaronmcadam> can u not see dataType in that param list
[08:49:24] <louigi> aaronmcadam, eddiemonge thank you very much guys, it works
[08:50:35] <louigi> aaronmcadam, is in general IE8 supporting jQuery or are there unsupported stuff?
[08:50:36] <beefman> http://pastebin.com/VXZPSMyt i've pasted...  i want the behavior on mouseover of el7 to be like that of el8, because i want to put it on all of them using the one function.   any ideas?
[08:50:45] <louigi> for a while I thought IE8 broke jQuery
[08:51:10] <aaronmcadam> huh
[08:51:51] <aaronmcadam> wooooohoooooooooo jqm 1.0 is out :D
[08:52:33] <jwmann> Why does everything animate properly except for the display block? http://d.pr/IpD2
[08:53:30] <aaronmcadam> bit strange trying to animate the display property
[08:53:33] <eddiemonge> jwmann: because you cant animate a boolean value
[08:53:35] <aaronmcadam> lol
[08:53:49] <eddiemonge> jwmann: animate automatically adds display block
[08:54:19] <jwmann> eddiemonge: Ooooooooooooooooooooh
[08:54:21] <jwmann> Okay
[08:55:28] <jwmann> eddiemonge: That's weird because it still doesn't change for some reason.. http://d.pr/ERHo
[08:56:23] <eddiemonge> whats it start at?
[08:56:51] <kategeek> jwmann, .show().animate ?
[08:58:23] <jwmann> eddiemonge: I starts as display: none, top: 600px, opacity: 0
[08:58:30] <jwmann> kategeek: I'll try that
[08:59:05] <ptahdunbar> is there an event I can watch for a ul when li items get added/removed?
[09:00:10] <eddiemonge> ptahdunbar: no but you can add a function as a callback when you add them
[09:00:49] <ptahdunbar> eddiemonge: I'll try that, thx.
[09:07:46] <Druide_> DEAR FRIEND, MY NAME IS BERLUSCONI, I AM A FORMER PRESIDENT OF A COUNTRY AND I HAVE A BUSINESS PROPOSAL TO TRANSFER MONEY OUT OF COUNTRY...
[09:08:08] <fris> let me give you my bank details
[09:09:05] <johnline3> lol
[09:11:55] <beefman> eddiemonge: can you take a look at my paste and tell me why toCenter is executing before i mouse over el7?  http://pastebin.com/VXZPSMyt
[09:12:45] <ccmonster> hey guys - have a question about autocomplete : http://pastie.org/2878842
[09:13:08] <ccmonster> i dont seem to  be returning the data right. the auto complete is not prompting with any data, although its parsing and such correctly.
[09:13:42] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ beefman
[09:13:43] <bot-t> beefman, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[09:14:15] <beefman> sure thing
[09:14:42] <phlp> ccmonster: instead of returning d you need to use the second param of the source callback since your ajax is async
[09:15:16] <phlp> source: function(request, result)  ...  result(d);
[09:16:03] <ccmonster> um, just use result as the var instead
[09:16:05] <ccmonster> and then return result
[09:16:30] <rroelofs> is there a list anywhere of commands bot-t knows?
[09:16:44] <beefman> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/AFxCc/
[09:16:45] <eddiemonge> not anymore
[09:17:00] <phlp> autocomplete passes a callback to your source callback for you to use for an ajax request. you cant just return the result
[09:17:10] <ccmonster> phlp, can i just name the second param d. like source:function(request,d), or no?
[09:17:20] <ccmonster> hmm
[09:17:41] <ccmonster> i dont see an example of that in the docs.
[09:18:00] <eddiemonge> beefman: what do you think "this" is in toCenter?
[09:18:46] <phlp> ccmonster: look at the "remote jsonp datasource" example
[09:18:59] <beefman> eddiemonge: i call it from a mouseover, so i figured it would be the element with the mouseover assigned to it.  i asked about that earlier
[09:19:13] <random_> Hello. I'm trying to send a request and some data to another webpage on the same domain, and a function on that webpage will do some stuff with it, and then return it. Any help would be appreciated.
[09:19:32] <ccmonster> i was referencing that and i was getting an error on the response part
[09:19:41] <ccmonster> some bit about it not being a object or somethign
[09:19:42] <ccmonster> hold up
[09:19:55] <Chopps> i need help with this tooltip plugin http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/ ive implemented it with success(show plaintext tooltips), but cant make it display html inside the tooltip (i want to display a list of elements), can someone help me with this pls??
[09:20:08] <phlp> ccmonster: probably because you named your param for you .getJSON callback response on line 5
[09:20:20] <ccmonster> ah, there we go
[09:20:37] <ccmonster> got it working
[09:21:47] <eddiemonge> beefman: oh its triggering because you are calling toCenter instead of passing it in
[09:22:11] <beefman> eddiemonge: can you explain the difference?
[09:22:18] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/AFxCc/1/
[09:22:31] <eddiemonge> $(ele).click(passInFunc);
[09:22:45] <eddiemonge> $(ele).click(passInReturnValueOfFunc() );
[09:23:20] <eddiemonge> if you add the () it calls the function and passes in its return value. without the parens, it passes a string which then gets called in the click function
[09:23:46] <beefman> eddiemonge: oooh, i see.  how do i tell it that i want to pass xyz as the arg when it does call it?
[09:24:04] <beefman> that's the eventdata object?
[09:24:58] <ccmonster> thanks a lot phlp . Got it working superbly. gracias
[09:25:23] <phlp> ;)
[09:25:58] <beefman> eddiemonge: will it default to the first paramet of the function?  so i say mouseover( 500, toCenter );  then in toCenter refer to it by the name i gave it in function defn?
[09:26:33] <eddiemonge> beefman: do it as .click(function() { yourFunc(args); });
[09:26:51] <beefman> eddiemonge: ok.  ty much
[09:29:25] <random_> I'm having some troubles with sending information to another .php page, where it uses a function to parse the data, and then returning it
[09:29:40] <VeXii> another?
[09:29:41] <random_> (JQuery + AJAX)
[09:29:52] <Benn> Whats the exact issue?
[09:30:12] <Benn> does it return something?
[09:30:19] <random_> Nope.
[09:30:27] <Benn> does the PHP recieve anything?
[09:30:54] <random_> Usually when I try I get a "Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.", else I probably did something wrong
[09:31:00] <VeXii> try doing a var_dump on the request ^^
[09:31:12] <VeXii> well youre doing ajax to a php file on a nother server then
[09:31:27] <random_> No, it's on the same domain
[09:31:27] <beefman> eddiemonge: then how do i get the element to which the mouseover is assigned into toCenter?  I tried adding another parameter, then making it mouseover( function(){ toCenter(500, this);}); but no dice
[09:31:46] <VeXii> then make sure you put the path as relative
[09:32:55] <random_> Also, how would I implement a function to get the data, and returning it? That's basically what's struggling me
[09:33:24] <Benn> use the success callback
[09:33:44] <jammsen> hi guys
[09:34:08] <Chopps> i need help with this tooltip plugin http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/ ive implemented it with success(show plaintext tooltips), but cant make it display html inside the tooltip (i want to display a list of elements), can someone help me with this pls??
[09:34:25] <jammsen> is there a jquery grid that can handle data, which will be changed trough reverse ajax?
[09:35:16] <Benn> What are you trying to do Jammsen?
[09:35:34] <jwmann> I still don't know why I can't animate display: block
[09:35:38] <jammsen> i want to display gameserver stats from players
[09:36:09] <jammsen> but the data change maybe every second so i will send these changes through eventbased nodejs or comet or reverse ajax
[09:36:41] <jammsen> maybe there is a grid where i only bind the data and it can handle the refresh/redraw itself
[09:36:59] <jammsen> like gridview.invalidate in .net
[09:37:13] <phlp> beefman: if you were using a slightly more recent jquery you could do .mouseover(500,toCenter); and have function toCenter(e) { console.log(e.data); }
[09:37:49] <beefman> ph1p: i only have 1.3.2.... using drupal
[09:38:09] <jammsen> @ jwmann
[09:38:37] <phlp> beefman: passing 'this' like you did should work though
[09:38:42] <random_> http://pastebin.com/cmZwtNat      Is what my code looks like right now, haven't really gotten into this yet, so yeah.
[09:38:44] <jwmann> ?
[09:39:07] <jammsen> jwmann : read above
[09:39:19] <aaronmcadam> lol
[09:39:42] <aaronmcadam> if you stop and think, how can you transition between block and inline, it doesn't make any sense
[09:40:28] <beefman> ph1p: ok.  i added parameter elmnt as second param to toCenter, and inside, elmnt.css(...) gives error elmnt.css is not a functino
[09:40:40] <Stereo> I have this weird issue where Chrome sends an xmlhttprequest even though my $.ajax() has only been triggered once
[09:40:45] <aaronmcadam> beefman: u need to wrap it in $
[09:40:56] <aaronmcadam> elemnt should be a jQuery obj there
[09:40:57] <Stereo> has anyone seen this before? I don't even know where to start debugging
[09:41:14] <beefman> aaronmcadam: you mean inside it, use $(elmnt).css?
[09:41:17] <aaronmcadam> aye
[09:41:21] <jwmann> I'm not going to answer out of principle.
[09:41:36] <Stereo> jwmann: was that for me? :)
[09:41:50] <aaronmcadam> what do u mean only triggered once
[09:41:54] <jwmann> nah that was for the other guy
[09:42:02] <Stereo> it's triggered by a button, which is pressed once
[09:42:06] <aaronmcadam> right
[09:42:19] <aaronmcadam> so chrome is sending the req twice?
[09:42:40] <Stereo> it's sending the request *seven times*
[09:42:45] <aaronmcadam> hah jesus
[09:43:01] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle
[09:43:05] <aaronmcadam> plz
[09:43:37] <Stereo> just a sec
[09:44:51] <beefman> aaronmcadam: ty
[09:45:07] <aaronmcadam> np
[09:45:51] <Stereo> bleh, copy-pasting stuff is a pain in chrome
[09:45:53] <Onyx47> hey, anyone ever fiddled with galleria plugin?
[09:48:17] <Stereo> hah, of course on jsfiddle it doesn't do it
[09:48:18] <Stereo> http://jsfiddle.net/PDVYu/
[09:48:22] <Onyx47> I'm flipping through docs and can't find if there's any way to completely disable what it calls 'stage' (where images actually show), I want have only thumbnails in certain sections of the site and keep the visual consistency
[09:48:41] <wowtux> hello
[09:48:58] <magcius> Stereo, take your entire HTML, JS, and CSS, and then strip it down until it goes away.
[09:49:35] <phlp> Chopps: looks like tooltip strips the title before calling bodyHandler which is totally stupid but you can work around it if you grab the title before http://jsfiddle.net/Rwfuc
[09:49:41] <mikunos> hi guys how have I check if an item has children? Is this way correct http://pastie.org/2879016 ?
[09:50:25] <Stereo> magcius: here's the weird part: I fiddled with it and it doesn't do it anymore
[09:50:46] <Stereo> it suddenly stopped doing it
[09:50:57] <Stereo> I'm going to blame Chrome
[09:51:19] <Stereo> weird though
[09:51:41] <Stereo> ok, my second question is about remove()
[09:51:52] <Stereo> once you remove an object, it's gone, isn't it?
[09:52:17] <Stereo> disappeared from the dom, no way to get it back?
[09:52:33] <kategeek> mikunos: > 0 not > 1, your code would fail with one child
[09:52:43] <Stereo> because I'm calling remove() on a <tr>, do a couple of things, then it appears again
[09:53:30] <winterpk> Hi everyone
[09:54:02] <winterpk> Does anyone know why the scrollTop() method acts differently in firefox vs. chrome?
[09:55:12] <Chopps> phlp, what can i do if the titles are in the options of a select? how do i grab the title?
[09:55:14] <magcius> Stereo, you're going to have to show some code.
[09:55:15] <kategeek> winterpk, what problem are you having?
[09:55:26] <winterpk> I want to set a scroll box to always start at the bottom.  To do this in firefox I use: $(selector).scrollTop(-9999999999) but in chrome its the opposite; scrollTop(999999999)
[09:55:36] <mikunos> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/jydsn/2/
[09:55:52] <mikunos> kategeek: http://jsfiddle.net/jydsn/2/
[09:56:01] <phlp> Chopps: i'm not sure what you mean. do you want a tooltip to show the list of options from a select?
[09:56:16] <xckpd7> is there a better way to load stuff than document.ready? what if I want something to load as soon as it can? must it be on document ready?
[09:56:55] <kategeek> winterpk would $(selector).scrollTop($(selector).height()) work for both?
[09:57:02] <Stereo> I'm really not sure what could make my zombie <tr>s come back from being remove()'d
[09:57:26] <Chopps> no, i want the tooltip to show me the title of each option, the title contains a desc of that element
[09:57:41] <igcewieling1> .change() is called when a form field is changed.  I'm looking for something which is called when focus leaves a field.
[09:57:49] <Stereo> can you try it? If you go to http://streetlist.openstreetmap.lu/streetlist/commune/Luxembourg and enter anything in the OSM match field in the first table, that row is going to be removed. Then it comes back.
[09:57:57] <Stereo> igcewieling1: blur
[09:58:07] <igcewieling1> Stereo: thanks.
[09:58:20] <winterpk> kategeek: I don't think so, but I'll try
[10:00:58] <winterpk> kategeek: it almost worked.  But if the div is too long, then it wont scroll to the very bottom. Just half way.  Any other ideas?
[10:01:11] <igcewieling1> When I tab out of an empty field and I use .focus() to move focus back to the field, it appears there is a TAB in the field, .val('') does not seem to clear out that tab.
[10:01:32] <phlp> Chopps: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Rwfuc/1
[10:02:39] <winterpk> kategeek: I multiplied it by 100k and it worked. ie: $("div#im-history").scrollTop($("div#im-history").height()*100000);
[10:03:03] <Stereo> ok, so sorting a table with tablesorter makes remove()'d <tr>s appear again
[10:03:49] <wowtux> hello i have a little confusion
[10:03:57] <Chopps> yes phlp, but only display the title of the option ure hovering, not all the options at the same time
[10:04:02] <wowtux> between document.ready function and click function
[10:04:48] <wowtux> i need put differents click.function inside document.ready function, is this right?
[10:07:39] <wowtux> i have a problem with global variable
[10:08:09] <wowtux> when i set values inside click.function, its doesnt work in another function
[10:08:15] <wowtux> how is it possible?
[10:08:36] <magcius> Stereo, I believe tablesorter copies the table when you first init it. That's why.
[10:08:52] <kategeek> wowtux, is the variable declared outside of your click fuction, can you make a demo?
[10:09:38] <acidjazz> hey guys
[10:10:05] <acidjazz> so im testing this app i wrote in jquery in IE8 and i keep getting 'object expected' everywhere .. anything in particular i should be looking for?
[10:10:21] <wowtux> kategeek, yeah outside click function
[10:10:44] <wowtux> kategeek, but inside click function i set value
[10:11:17] <wowtux> kategeek, but later the function called inside click.function can't read variable!
[10:11:33] <wowtux> kategeek, message is "a is undefined" and it generate incremental a lot of errors
[10:11:50] <kategeek> wowtux, make a demo
[10:12:22] <Apoposkt> oie
[10:12:23] <phlp> Chopps: it already does the tooltip you just cant see it because it's behind the select http://jsfiddle.net/Rwfuc/2
[10:12:24] <Apoposkt> beleza
[10:12:27] <jubby> Hey all! Is there a way to retrieve the index of an element in a jQuery array? https://gist.github.com/1373902
[10:12:44] <Stereo> magcius: wow. I'll try without tablesorter then.
[10:12:46] <jubby> Trying to do this with curSection = $(this).eq();
[10:13:43] <wowtux> kategeek, ok http://jsfiddle.net/mctux/hGc9k/3/
[10:13:48] <Stereo> magcius: that fixed it. You rock.
[10:13:49] <kategeek> jubby, $(this).index() is the index of an element vs its siblings
[10:13:51] <wowtux> kategeek, thx in advace ;)
[10:14:10] <magcius> Stereo, there might be a way to remove the rows from the tablesorter copy as well
[10:14:17] <wowtux> kategeek, feedUri is variable with problem
[10:14:32] <jubby> kategeek: Thx! Much oblige.
[10:14:49] <wowtux> kategeek, if i set feedUri value inside loadData , it works
[10:14:55] <wowtux> kategeek, if no , no
[10:15:07] <na3r> what's wrong with my code?
[10:15:08] <na3r> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/509343/
[10:15:35] <Stereo> magcius: yeah, I saw there was an append() but couldn't find a remove()
[10:15:49] <Stereo> so I just sort the tables, then remove the rows, then do my stuff
[10:15:50] <na3r> i wanna if ajax is starting dont request any ajax request
[10:22:00] <kategeek> wowtux, http://jsfiddle.net/qbKc7/ it can work so something must be wrong elsewhere in your code, strip it down until you find the problem. Right now your fiddle gives me unrelated errors.
[10:23:34] <acidjazz> so im testing this app i wrote in jquery in IE8 and i keep getting 'object expected' everywhere .. anything in particular i should be looking for?
[10:24:29] <kategeek> acidjazz, are the lines that are giving you the error in jquery or your code?
[10:24:29] <chrisinajar> acidjazz: yeah, look at what line it complains about first
[10:24:30] <Chopps> phlp, but it doesnt display the list as it should, pls check this http://jsfiddle.net/Yyk3C/ to see what i mean
[10:24:32] <snover> F12 developer tools would be a good thing to look for in particular
[10:24:52] <acidjazz> kategeek: my code
[10:24:56] <acidjazz> im looking at the linse
[10:24:59] <acidjazz> theyre fine
[10:25:06] <chrisinajar> ok, no they're not
[10:25:09] <acidjazz> one is  54       $('.button_invite').click(f.i);
[10:25:16] <chrisinajar> what's f
[10:25:16] <acidjazz> f is fine and f.i is fine
[10:25:21] <acidjazz> jQuery ius loaded
[10:25:26] <acidjazz> console.log'ed em all
[10:25:36] <acidjazz> f is an obj i is a func
[10:25:47] <snover> at the time that the debugger breaks?
[10:26:01] <chrisinajar> you console.log'd them the line before the problem one?
[10:26:03] <snover> or at some point in the future and you have created a house of cards with race conditions?
[10:26:04] <acidjazz> well its definde below the function that line of code is in
[10:26:12] <acidjazz> but i run it all in the footer after the script is included
[10:26:23] <chrisinajar> and that's the *first* error it gives you? IE only gives 1 useful error then all the ones after that are always broken and wrong
[10:26:30] <acidjazz> chrisinajar: commented out the problem one and console.log'ed em both
[10:26:38] <acidjazz> crankharder: only error
[10:26:45] <acidjazz> script stops running after object expected
[10:26:49] <chrisinajar> acidjazz: uncomment, console.log the line before
[10:27:00] <chrisinajar> the immediate line before
[10:27:24] <acidjazz> line above:  52     if (bb.section == 'create') {
[10:27:29] <chrisinajar> like not kidding i mean the line before (i say this because a lot of people will think putting it elsewhere will be "the same" and are wrong)
[10:27:31] <acidjazz> console.log'ed bb.section
[10:27:32] <acidjazz> its fine
[10:27:37] <acidjazz> no errors if i comment it out chrisinajar
[10:27:48] <chrisinajar> then don't comment it out
[10:27:55] <kategeek> console.log(f.i) the line before
[10:27:55] <phlp> Chopps: http://jsfiddle.net/Yyk3C/2
[10:28:03] <chrisinajar> indeed
[10:28:15] <chrisinajar> like, the immediate line before with nothing between them except a semicolon
[10:28:17] <acidjazz> line 54 character 7.. which is $
[10:28:27] <chrisinajar> what's the line before that
[10:28:34] <chrisinajar> and is it missing a ';'
[10:28:54] <acidjazz> chrisinajar:   handlers: function() {
[10:28:54] <acidjazz>     /*
[10:28:54] <acidjazz>     $('.calendar_icon').click(function() {
[10:28:54] <acidjazz>       $($(this).attr('trigger')).trigger('click');
[10:28:54] <acidjazz>     });

[10:29:24] <kategeek> ?p @ acidjazz
[10:29:25] <bot-t> acidjazz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:29:30] <acidjazz> i did http://pastebin.com/Vuj0ikbF
[10:29:32] <phlp> Chopps: however i dont think you should put html in the title attribute like that. you should build what you want from the option value and text
[10:29:33] <acidjazz> sorry thought i ctrl+c'ed
[10:30:09] <chrisinajar> acidjazz: i don't see console.log
[10:30:11] <Ox41> >> var foo = [4]; alert(foo.length);
[10:30:29] <acidjazz> hmm f.i() in the console says undefinde
[10:30:30] <acidjazz> chrisinajar: i removed it
[10:30:42] <chrisinajar> acidjazz: don't until this works
[10:30:58] <chrisinajar> acidjazz: please don't edit code before pasting, it voids the point of pasting code

[10:31:07] <Pallet> hi there, I've got a <type="checkbox" id="tanc_accept"> how do I do jQuery("#tandc_accept"). and test if it's checked ?
[10:31:26] <acidjazz> chrisinajar: its in its original form
[10:31:27] <acidjazz> ok
[10:31:37] <chrisinajar> .attr('checked'), i think?
[10:31:47] <Pallet> attr thanks
[10:31:48] <chrisinajar> just google "jquery checkbox checked"
[10:31:56] <chrisinajar> it'll be like the first or second hit
[10:32:05] <kategeek> Pallet .prop('checked') will give you a bool instead of 'checked'
[10:32:13] <Pallet> perfect
[10:32:16] <chrisinajar> even better!
[10:32:29] <chrisinajar> acidjazz: add debug statements, paste code, paste console output
[10:32:29] <acidjazz> or .is(":checked")
[10:32:33] <kategeek> Pallet, wait that also changes the value
[10:32:48] <acidjazz> chrisinajar: theres no information console.log pastes the exact function and object
[10:32:50] <chrisinajar> Pallet: google it, we don't know what we're talking about
[10:33:04] <chrisinajar> acidjazz: there is information and i want to see it.
[10:33:18] <Rembane> bblfg
[10:33:29] <Rembane> lol mischat
[10:33:56] <Chopps> <3 phlp thats exactly what i was looking for :D youre awesome man, thank you so much
[10:34:17] <phlp> no problem :)
[10:34:25] <acidjazz> even THIS errors chrisinajar
[10:34:26] <acidjazz>     $('.button_invite').click(function() { console.log('test'); });
[10:34:34] <jwmann> Why does my div not display: block at all? All the other animations are working and completing but the display: block isn't doing anything http://d.pr/Hn48
[10:34:44] <jwmann> Line 16
[10:36:02] <chrisinajar> acidjazz: try changing $ to jQuery
[10:36:30] <chrisinajar> jQuery('.class_name').click(function(){ console.log("Success"); });
[10:38:28] <ragas> when i use a background-image in an input field IE doesnt center the text in the field correctly. (shocking, i know). Seen that?
[10:39:26] <kategeek> jwmann, is your callback called? that should set display to block...
[10:39:31] <ravenzz> ragas ask on #css
[10:39:54] <jwmann> kategeek: Yea I know it 'should' but it's not
[10:39:57] <jwmann> It's making me mad
[10:40:45] <chrisinajar> jwmann: try show()
[10:41:02] <jwmann> show was working before but it stopped working
[10:41:03] <kategeek> jwmann, $("div#"+$(this).attr('id')) is that what you want
[10:41:43] <ravenzz> perhaps without div it is faster
[10:42:13] <kategeek> jwmann the div with the id of the div you just clicked?
[10:42:41] <jwmann> kategeek: ye
[10:42:56] <acidjazz> chrisinajar: already tried that no luck
[10:43:00] <wowtux> kategeek, oh thx , sorry im in call
[10:43:18] <chrisinajar> jwmann: does the animation complete show up?
[10:43:25] <jwmann> Yes
[10:43:49] <jwmann> I'm replacing the css display changes with their relative .show() and .hide()
[10:43:55] <jwmann> to see what happens
[10:44:01] <chrisinajar> i recommend it
[10:44:08] <chrisinajar> it's clearer to read, anyway
[10:44:24] <kategeek> jwmann but how does that work? do you have 2 elements with the id in question?
[10:44:49] <ravenzz> IDs must be unique
[10:45:45] <jwmann> kategeek: Yea, except one is a#foo and div#foo
[10:46:05] <mbtez> i'm trying to use .slideDown and .slideUp on an element, how do i make it so that it 'floats' and doesn't affect the placement of other elements when it does that?  it already has z-index: 5 !important, position:relative and float:right;
[10:46:16] <chrisinajar> jwmann: try doing a#foo_a and div#foo_div. select appropriately
[10:46:18] <mbtez> not sure what to use
[10:46:47] <chrisinajar> mbtez: position: absolute. it's a CSS thing.
[10:46:48] <acidjazz> i finally got somethign
[10:46:49] <acidjazz> SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'fadeIn'
[10:47:02] <mbtez> there's no other way?
[10:47:12] <mbtez> position absolute is going to cause all kinds of layout ugliness for that part
[10:47:23] <chrisinajar> mbtez: then fix your layout
[10:47:33] <ravenzz> mbtez relative position
[10:47:37] <ravenzz> is not the way
[10:47:43] <mbtez> it's not my layout
[10:47:45] <mbtez> lol
[10:47:48] <ravenzz> you should set the position to absolute
[10:47:51] <chrisinajar> mbtez: objects that aren't position: absolute use up space, position: absolute doesn't use up space.
[10:48:14] <mbtez> ugh
[10:48:17] <mbtez> once i do that
[10:48:21] <mbtez> it's trapped beneath a flash object :( :(
[10:48:25] <acidjazz> so .fadeIn doesnt work but .show works
[10:48:27] <acidjazz> fukc you IE8
[10:48:30] <chrisinajar> mbtez: stop using flash
[10:48:37] <mbtez> i would love to
[10:48:41] <mbtez> i like <video>
[10:48:50] <mbtez> wait, is lower z-index higher?
[10:48:52] <chrisinajar> i like anything that isn't flash
[10:49:02] <chrisinajar> high z = shows up
[10:49:20] <chrisinajar> mbtez: think of z-index as altitude, and you're looking at it top-down.
[10:49:20] <kategeek> mbtez wrap is in a div and set the hight of that div to the hight of the thing you are going to slide up
[10:49:22] <mbtez> there isn't actually flash here it's just a link to flash, and it's z-index: 0 !important that's showing up over z-index 5 !important
[10:49:51] <chrisinajar> mbtez: position absolutes and relatives can mess with those. check your inherited z-index's
[10:50:17] <mbtez> firebug says it's set to 5
[10:50:30] <chrisinajar> indeed, what i said is still true though
[10:50:48] <mbtez> it's higher than the ones going over it :(
[10:50:56] <chrisinajar> yes, check their damn parents
[10:51:01] <mbtez> i did
[10:51:18] <mbtez> they're all 0 !important
[10:51:52] <chrisinajar> ok, fix the parent to the one that is underneath, particularly the first parent who has a special position (absolute or relative)
[10:52:09] <chrisinajar> also, just a preference thing, but don't use !important unless you need to
[10:52:48] <chrisinajar> with html/css, you should always do only what works, because anything else you add might just break it instead. it's a very non-science.
[10:55:57] <wowtux> kategeek, equal, same error :(
[10:55:58] <dnsdds> I have a bunch of <p></p>'s in a string, and I'd like to know how many. How can I accomplish this?
[10:56:21] <wowtux> kategeek, a is undefined but in fiddle it works same structure
[10:56:34] <wowtux> kategeek, now i dont use document.ready function,
[10:56:38] <wowtux> kategeek, is right
[10:56:39] <wowtux> ?
[10:58:00] <phlp> dnsdds: $('<p>a</p><p>b</p>').length
[10:58:17] <dnsdds> phlp: Thanks!
[10:59:16] <jwmann> kategeek: I think I broke javascript
[10:59:18] <kategeek> wowtux, the structure is right, something else in your code is wrong, strip stuff away until you find it
[10:59:35] <jwmann> kategeek: I'm trying to do a callback after the .each() is finished: http://d.pr/s2B6
[11:01:49] <kategeek> jwmann each is async?
[11:02:02] <jwmann> kategeek: I have no idea
[11:02:13] <wowtux> kategeek, ok ok but then isnt necesary use document.ready , no?
[11:02:28] <jwmann> kategeek: What I'm trying to accomplish is force the 'hide' and THEN do the animation
[11:02:50] <mbtez> lol http://occupyflash.org/
[11:03:02] <mbtez> slashdot "popcorn anyone?"
[11:04:32] <Conexion> Hmm. So I've been using .css('-webkit-transform', blah); just fine... but when I try $(px).css('-webkit-transform'); - It returns an error
[11:04:33] <wowtux> kategeek, please look last time ,http://jsfiddle.net/qbKc7/5/
[11:05:02] <Conexion> Am I able to get the value for a transform?
[11:05:05] <wowtux> kategeek, look loaddata function , it fail to me when i use feedUri inside getDataFeed, the use is right?
[11:06:56] <jwmann> :(
[11:07:23] <kategeek> jwmann: http://jsfiddle.net/772hs/1/
[11:07:54] <jwmann> oooo
[11:07:56] <jwmann> I like this
[11:08:41] <jwmann> I'll test this after my lunch!
[11:08:47] <jwmann> thanks kategeek
[11:08:50] <jwmann> I'll be back
[11:09:12] <kategeek> np, also taking lunch, sorry wowtux, I don't see the problem
[11:10:35] <wowtux> kategeek, ok thx , nice lunch, getdatafeed function like right
[11:11:33] <caddoo> how can i get the current window height of the user
[11:11:39] <caddoo> the viewable window i mean
[11:11:45] <caddoo> doesn't have to work in IE
[11:14:31] <gov_imp> hello... I have a generic question about jquery. Am I in the right place to ask?
[11:14:38] <Eviltwin> Yes
[11:14:44] <dogarrhea2> does clone copy id's ?
[11:14:45] <gov_imp> Ok
[11:15:15] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Yes
[11:15:24] <dogarrhea2> won't that break the dom?
[11:16:35] <Eviltwin> dogarrhea2: Well, having more than one element with the same ID doesn't "break" the DOM
[11:16:41] <Eviltwin> It's just not correct
[11:16:45] <Eviltwin> And secondly
[11:16:46] <chovy> $("#foo").text()+1 == '21' not 3 (when 'foo' is 2.
[11:16:57] <Eviltwin> The elements you clone are not added to the DOM yet
[11:16:58] <gov_imp> I have a webpage with some text I am trying to change with jquery. the text is wrapped in a <td> with other elements put not contained within its own tag. spefically a &nbsp;
[11:17:10] <Eviltwin> They're part of a separate document fragment until you add them somewhere
[11:17:13] <Eviltwin> So you have time to change them
[11:17:26] <Eviltwin> chovy: parseInt($("#foo").text())+1
[11:17:31] <chovy> ok
[11:18:15] <Dave_Stein> Eviltwin: is there anyway to download a copy of a repo without first running "git init" on a folder?
[11:18:31] <gov_imp> I am trying to remove this whitespace <td><a></a> &nbsp; <span></span></td>
[11:18:50] <Eviltwin> Dave_Stein: `git clone <repo> <target folder>`
[11:19:39] <wowtux> kategeek, ok its solve, feedUri need init value
[11:19:42] <Dave_Stein> just that one right? my coworkers dont believe me that there's no way to export the info without getting the .git folder too
[11:19:57] <wowtux> kategeek, but now only works one click.function, another no
[11:20:09] <Eviltwin> Dave_Stein: The .git folder is what tracks all of the repo information
[11:20:32] <Eviltwin> Dave_Stein: Without the .git folder, it's just the copy of the code you had checked out with none of the version information or anything
[11:20:37] <Dave_Stein> yeah i know we just made a repo of JS and wanted to just slap the JS in with a build script and not worry about the .git folder but i was saying we should use clone and then rm the .git
[11:20:52] <igcewieling1> I'm still a bit of a JS n00b.  I use .blur() to check if a field is empty.  Then use .focus() to send focus back to the field.  However, it appears there is a TAB in the "empty" field, .val('') does not seem to clear out that tab.  Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix that?
[11:20:56] <Dave_Stein> gov_imp: $('#el').html().replace(/&nbsp;/g, '' )
[11:21:32] <Eviltwin> Dave_Stein: What we do is clone to a new copy, checkout the branch we wanted in that copy, rm the .git
[11:21:49] <Dave_Stein> yeah that's what im arguiing for this second
[11:21:50] <Dave_Stein> :)
[11:22:12] <Eviltwin> git clone is interesting though
[11:22:23] <Eviltwin> You'd think that it'd be the same as like a `cp -R` or something
[11:22:29] <Eviltwin> But it's actually different
[11:23:06] <Dave_Stein> yeah cause it sends in the git data which is fine cause we can run rm
[11:23:07] <Eviltwin> It uses the repo you target as the remote for the copy
[11:29:42] <sssteven> if anyone is familiar with deferreds and the new Callbacks object, I would greatly appreciate it if you read my recent forum post: forum.jquery.com/topic/deferred-callback-list-behavior-and-stoponfalse
[11:32:44] <ajpiano> sssteven: i've passed it along to julian, who mostly maintains those modules
[11:33:02] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: headed down to you now !
[11:33:09] <sssteven> ajpiano: thank you!
[11:35:49] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: cool
[11:35:56] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: maybe youll be able to help me iwth git too lol
[11:36:25] <gov_imp_> thx Dave. but I couldn't get it to work
[11:36:44] <Dave_Stein> the line i gave gives you the corrected html
[11:36:50] <Dave_Stein> you then still need to do $('#el').html( corrected_html )
[11:37:31] <sushimako> ehlo, is there any way to bind a callback on the creation on a specific domnode? i want to trigger a callback when, e.g <div class='foo' /> gets added to the dom tree (either on pageload or later)
[11:44:11] <Dave_Stein> sushimako: No, but you shouldbe the one adding it so you can trigger a custom even on create
[11:45:36] <wowtux> one question , what is jsLint?
[11:45:59] <sushimako> Dave_Stein: yup. just thought there would be a way to make it even easier. but triggering a custom event is ok. thx!
[11:46:03] <Dave_Stein> ?jslint @ wowtux
[11:46:04] <bot-t> wowtux, JSLint,The JavaScript Code Quality Tool - http://www.jslint.com/
[11:46:09] <Dave_Stein> ?jslint
[11:46:09] <bot-t> JSLint,The JavaScript Code Quality Tool - http://www.jslint.com/
[11:46:12] <Dave_Stein> i thought it had a bigger explanation
[11:46:18] <Dave_Stein> it tells you what youre doing wrong
[11:46:20] <Dave_Stein> and hurts your feelings
[11:47:00] <wowtux> Dave_Stein, but errors in jsLint are real?
[11:47:12] <wowtux> Dave_Stein, because this errors dont appear me in firebug
[11:47:22] <wowtux> Dave_Stein, but yes in jslint
[11:47:31] <wowtux> Dave_Stein, is normal?
[11:47:44] <Dave_Stein> some things error in IE and not FF
[11:47:46] <Dave_Stein> most notably commas
[11:48:30] <wowtux> Dave_Stein, ok then jslint is for debug in cross-browser?
[11:48:38] <wowtux> Dave_Stein, ok thx
[11:48:40] <Dave_Stein> ya
[11:49:22] <elb0w> What would be the proper way to keep checking if a dom exists?
[11:49:43] <gov_imp> Dave_Stein: that worked! thank you
[11:50:18] <someprimetime> i currently have the load() function within a mouseover() event functionâ€¦ how can i prevent the load from being called multiple times? i.e. on first mouseover and not additional ones?
[11:50:30] <Rembane> someprimetime: Set a variable to true.
[11:50:43] <someprimetime> yeah, i had that originally, but i was wondering if that would be the most elegant way
[11:51:22] <elb0w> can you wildcard a dom?
[11:51:35] <someprimetime> an element within a dom you mean?
[11:51:38] <Dave_Stein> $(document).
[11:51:44] <someprimetime> ah
[11:52:08] <elb0w> id="SOMETHING_4424242" I want to do $("#SOMETHING_*") and make that be the first element
[11:53:39] <sssteven> elb0w: I do not think that is possible, as jquery always returns elements in DOM order
[11:54:32] <wowtux> Dave_Stein, but jslint invent with unexpected space
[11:54:45] <_dave_h_d> hi all, does anyone have experience with dynatree, I can't seem to refresh it dynamically. The only way you can update it on the fly seems to be if your refresh html
[11:55:00] <wowtux> Dave_Stein, i quit space and say me error, i put space and give me error too ;). how is , please?

[12:03:36] <juha_> well hello there san francisco <3
[12:05:03] <jubby> Hey all! I need to check for a string in a URL. Can someone point me in the right direction?
[12:07:19] <warrenparsons> jubby: if ( window.location.href.indexOf(myString) !== -1) { ... }
[12:08:55] <jubby> warrenparsons:  specifially I need to grab the file name at the root, before the hash. foo.com/index.php#5, I need to grab "index php" out of that
[12:09:15] <warrenparsons> jubby: Check out the jQuery.url plugin. Makes a lot of that very easy.
[12:09:23] <warrenparsons> jubby: I use it on every project.
[12:10:02] <jubby> warrenparsons: This the one? http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/url
[12:10:45] <warrenparsons> jubby: This one - https://github.com/allmarkedup/jQuery-URL-Parser
[12:11:18] <jubby> warrenparsons: beautiful, thank you! =)
[12:13:19] <chovy> warrenparsons: it would be cool if jQuery had something built in for access url parameters.
[12:14:22] <warrenparsons> chovy: One one hand, yes. On the other, I think moving towards a lighter, slimmer jQuery is a wise move. And URL parsing isn't needed everywhere all the time.
[12:14:50] <warrenparsons> Just because I use it on every project doesn't mean that most people do.
[12:19:42] <jaequery> can i load a remote image onto a canvas? someone said thats not possible due to cross-site error. is this true?
[12:21:56] <warrenparsons> jaequery: Probably true
[12:22:07] <jaequery> thats stupid
[12:22:43] <chovy> warrenparsons: i think it's a useful utility that could offer simplicity.
[12:22:57] <chovy> it's a shame native js doesn't have an easy way to get at parameters.
[12:23:06] <chovy> location.href['username'
[12:23:13] <chovy> that would have been cool.
[12:23:25] <warrenparsons> chovy: You're right. But if we added every "useful utility that could offer simplicity" to jQuery core, it'd be several megs in file size.
[12:23:37] <warrenparsons> I think it's fine as a plugin.
[12:24:23] <karstenk1977_> please could you help for this each function
[12:24:30] <karstenk1977_> jQuery('.gallery li.image').each(function(index) {     this.css('height', this.next('img').height()+'px')      });
[12:24:49] <karstenk1977_> what i have to write for this
[12:25:08] <karstenk1977_> index?
[12:25:31] <kategeek> function(i, v)
[12:25:43] <kategeek> all this to $(v)
[12:25:51] <kategeek> or $(this)
[12:25:56] <karstenk1977_> k
[12:28:06] <stygyan> hello guys
[12:28:16] <stygyan> anyone knows if there's a jquery script that allows you to show random quotes?
[12:29:10] <stygyan> oh
[12:29:14] <stygyan> forget it, i think i found it
[12:32:22] <insign> hi everyone, how can I get the parent tag of a tag#test?
[12:33:20] <kategeek> insign parent element? .parent()
[12:33:33] <insign> kategeek, thanks
[12:34:48] <BillCriswell> stygyan: quotes[Math.round(Math.random()*(quotes.length-1))]; where quotes is an array of quotes.
[12:45:17] <karstenk1977_> please can you have a look at   http://concept.tom-develop.com/style/?ua=|%20Mozilla/5.0%20%28iPhone;%20U;%20XXXXX%20like%20Mac%20OS%20X;%20en%29%20AppleWebKit/420+%20%28KHTML,%20like%20Gecko%29%20Version/3.0%20Mobile/241%20Safari/419.3%20|#&ui-state=dialog
[12:46:04] <karstenk1977_> and tell me what i can do, that masonry first transform the li.image when all images are load and have set hight of li.image
[12:47:23] <karstenk1977_> i think masonry must have a delay
[12:47:44] <karstenk1977_> but i do not know how to solve
[12:50:31] <MarcWeber> .ready() ready handler is no longer called. Has there been any change?
[12:51:33] <chovy> how should we handle .live() if it's being removed?
[12:51:42] <hightekvagabond> switch to .on
[12:52:03] <chovy> hightekvagabond: that will work when creating events for objects that don't exist in the dom yet?
[12:53:30] <chovy> hightekvagabond: i assume you were talking to me, .live() should be replaced with .on()
[12:54:39] <hightekvagabond> yeah, I was talking to you chovy, but I probably shouldn't of spoken upâ€¦ I've never used live, I used bind(), and I remember Karl saying the other week in his jquery talk that live and bind were being replaced with on
[12:56:00] <phlp> chovy: there are examples for how to convert to .on in the docs http://api.jquery.com/live
[12:56:24] <kategeek> chovy if you pass a selector it is like live, if you don't it is like bind
[12:56:42] <emacsen> How do I make a conditional based on an id-selector? $("#thisnotarealid") always returns an object interpreted as true
[12:57:02] <shodan45> does .html() "block"? I'm selecting elements that are created by .html(), but getting nothing.
[12:57:09] <kategeek> emacsen, are you testing that it exists?
[12:57:35] <emacsen> kategeek, yup. If it's not, I'll append it. If it is, I want to use replaceWith on it
[12:57:38] <kategeek> emacsen use $("#id").length > 0
[12:57:38] <Eviltwin> shodan45: Yes
[12:57:53] <shodan45> Eviltwin: thanks
[12:57:54] <emacsen> kategeek, okay. Thanks
[12:58:05] * shodan45 goes back to banging his head on the wall
[12:58:28] <emacsen> kategeek, works perfectly. Much thanks!!!
[12:58:58] <stygyan> http://jsfiddle.net/zDBAP/ - what would be wrong with this?
[12:59:17] <Eviltwin> stygyan: Are you a Python person?
[12:59:27] <stygyan> i'm a html and css person.
[12:59:34] <stygyan> i don't program since I was 10
[12:59:39] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/zDBAP/1/
[12:59:47] <kategeek> stygyan, do you know how to view js errors?
[12:59:48] <stygyan> thank you
[13:00:00] <stygyan> yes, i was looking at it on chrome inspector
[13:00:05] <stygyan> but i didn't know what the error was
[13:00:10] <stygyan> just that it was an unexpected identifier
[13:00:59] <dnyy> so, i'm having a problem with prev and next. after a successful ajax call, a ul tag is filled with li elements. when a link is clicked, i do foo.next() (foo being one of the li tags) and it works as expected. if i call empty() on the ul, though, and refill it after another ajax call, doing next() seems to skip over every other li. any ideas why this would happen?
[13:01:07] <dnyy> kinda hard to explain, i guess, so let me know if that's not very clear
[13:01:13] <acidjazz> any1 got any advice for all this object expected crap i keep getting in IE
[13:01:30] <kategeek> stygyan, awesome just checking since learning without a console sucks
[13:01:49] <stygyan> ok, i got my random quotes grabber ready to go
[13:02:05] <stygyan> and conveniently located in an external js file
[13:04:34] <kategeek> dnyy, can you make a demo?
[13:05:04] <Eviltwin> ?jsfiddle @ dnyy

[13:05:21] <dnyy> kategeek: I thought of doing that, but I'm not sure how I would reproduce the AJAX calls on jsfiddle?
[13:06:49] <Eviltwin> dnyy: Look at "Testing Ajax request" on the left side
[13:07:17] <dnyy> Eviltwin: kk, doing it now
[13:09:52] <jwmann> kategeek: You there? :)
[13:10:08] <kategeek> heyo jwmann
[13:10:24] <jwmann> kategeek: I think I know why my jquery isn't working as intended
[13:10:49] <velts> has anyone user explorercanvas before here?
[13:11:30] <jwmann> kategeek: If you look here: http://d.pr/cQJs it shows that the 'showing' animation starts before the hiding animation stops.
[13:12:16] <kategeek> weird, could you put it in a fiddle?
[13:12:46] <jwmann> kategeek: that'd be a little difficult.. hmm *wondering how I'd accomplish this

[13:13:11] <jwmann> kategeek: Actually, you can access my staging server
[13:13:34] <kategeek> cool, pm?
[13:14:13] <stygyan> damn, i'm smart. s-m-r-t-d'oh!
[13:14:37] <acidjazz> why do i keep getting an object expected on $('.friends')
[13:14:59] <Eviltwin> ?
[13:15:50] <insign> how can I get the parent tag of a tag#test, that are have 3 tags layer between them?
[13:16:17] <Eviltwin> insign: Please explain further
[13:16:23] <Rembane> insign: Does the parent tag have an id or class or something like that?
[13:16:39] <insign> <div id=a><div id=b><div id=c></div></div></div>
[13:16:54] <insign> onclick in #c, get the parent #a
[13:17:01] <bakers> insign: .parent().parent()
[13:17:04] <SmartTowel> insign.... try .parents()
[13:17:08] <bakers> or
[13:17:10] <jwmann> kategeek: Hopw you got the pm
[13:17:13] <SmartTowel> http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[13:17:13] <Eviltwin> ?.closest @ insign
[13:17:15] <bot-t> insign, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[13:17:16] <bakers> insign: closest("#a")
[13:17:33] <someprimetime> what would be the best way to handle loading of social widgets (Facebook, stumble upon, twitter)? right now, i have an event that when you mouseover, it calls the scripts using $.load() on the containerâ€¦ but would it be better to set a timeout and load them after that expires than have the user have to wait for the data to get sent back with the load() method?
[13:18:10] <Rembane> insign: $('#c').parent('#a');
[13:18:19] <insign> Rembane, it dont work
[13:18:29] <insign> return [ ]
[13:18:33] <chovy> so does .on() and .delegate() only accept document as the selector (ie: $(document).on() )
[13:18:43] <Eviltwin> insign: You want .closest()
[13:18:50] <Eviltwin> chovy: No
[13:19:02] <insign> thanks, but it dont have an id, it can have a class, but this class will appear in many locals
[13:19:14] <insign> closest
[13:19:18] <chovy> Eviltwin: I can do $(".mylink").on('click', 'not sure what goes here', function(){ } );
[13:19:27] <Eviltwin> chovy: What are you trying to do?
[13:19:41] <chovy> Eviltwin: i use .live everywhere in my code and it's being deprecated.
[13:19:48] <chovy> I'm trying to figure out what the solution is.
[13:19:52] <chovy> for 1.7
[13:20:19] <gnarf> chovy: .live() is the same as a delegate on document
[13:20:28] <gnarf> only it wastes more time in setup
[13:20:40] <gnarf> you should switch to using delegate
[13:20:41] <Eviltwin> $(document).on("click","...",function(){}) produces the same result as $("...").live("click",function(){})
[13:20:41] <insign> $('#telefonia').closest('table')
[13:20:49] <insign> why it dont work? $('#telefonia').closest('table')
[13:20:51] <Eviltwin> gnarf: No, he should switch to using on
[13:21:06] <gnarf> sure
[13:21:41] <acidjazz> console.log($('.friends')); <- object expected error
[13:21:45] <acidjazz> if  ($('.friends')) { console.log('yes'); } <_ perfectly fine
[13:21:50] <acidjazz> (in IE9)
[13:21:56] <Eviltwin> Oh, that's your problem
[13:21:57] <Eviltwin> IE9
[13:22:35] <acidjazz> so.............
[13:22:56] <Eviltwin> insign: http://jsfiddle.net/kshyt/
[13:23:11] <Eviltwin> acidjazz: So don't use IE
[13:23:11] <chovy> Eviltwin: what's the selector as the 3rd argument for?
[13:23:20] <chovy> 2nd arg rather
[13:23:29] <chovy> $(document).on(events, selector, data, handler);
[13:23:42] <Eviltwin> chovy: Do you know how live works?
[13:24:02] <andrew9183> anyone know of a good drag and drop file list tree for jquery ?
[13:24:14] <chovy> Eviltwin: nope. i just know what it does. and allows me to attach event handlers before the element exists in the dom.
[13:24:16] <acidjazz> Eviltwin: not an option
[13:24:25] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Might be able to do something with jsTree?
[13:24:33] <warrenparsons> acidjazz: It's probably because $('.friends') is coming back as an empty object. If you check for if ( $('.friends').length ) you'll get a different result
[13:24:38] <insign> Eviltwin, thanks man
[13:25:11] <Eviltwin> chovy: Do you know why $(".foo").bind("click",function(){...}) doesn't do that and $(".foo").live("click",function(){...}) does?
[13:25:20] <hdon_> hi all :) are there any known issues calculating height with .height() on iphone?
[13:25:20] <chovy> Eviltwin: no.
[13:25:40] <andrew9183> hmm interesting, have you used it before Evil
[13:25:40] <Eviltwin> Do you know that $(".foo") does?
[13:25:54] <chovy> Eviltwin: that gets the .foo object
[13:25:55] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Not for drag and drop but other stuff
[13:26:23] <chovy> Eviltwin: i don't really know what any of it does under the hood.
[13:26:35] <Eviltwin> chovy: Actually it constructs a new collection consiting of every element that has the class "foo" at that moment
[13:26:59] <Eviltwin> If you hang on to that collection and then add/remove some of elements to/from the DOM
[13:27:03] <Eviltwin> Or mess with their classes
[13:27:06] <Eviltwin> That collection doesn't change
[13:27:14] <chovy> Eviltwin: ok
[13:27:31] <Eviltwin> Now what .bind does is it goes to each of those elements and registers a listener with each of them
[13:27:56] <Eviltwin> New elements may get added that matche the same selector
[13:28:06] <Eviltwin> But because they weren't in that collection, they didn't get a listener registered
[13:28:21] <Eviltwin> Now, do you know what event bubbling is?
[13:28:22] <chovy> ok
[13:28:29] <chovy> Eviltwin: yes.
[13:28:34] <Eviltwin> Describe it
[13:28:52] <chovy> if i click a child element somewhere the event will bubble all the way up the document tree.
[13:29:19] <Eviltwin> Right, if you have <html><body><div><span><a>...
[13:29:22] <Eviltwin> And you click that A
[13:29:27] <Eviltwin> the listeners on the A get hit
[13:29:32] <chovy> so if I click <a> inside <div> with $('div').click() the click event will fire when I click <a>
[13:29:33] <Eviltwin> Then the listeners on the span
[13:29:36] <Eviltwin> Then the listeners on the div
[13:29:39] <acidjazz> warrenparsons:   if (f.fObj == false && $('.friends').length) { f.fObj = $('.friends'); }
[13:29:42] <acidjazz> warrenparsons: exact same error
[13:29:42] <Eviltwin> Then the listeners on the body
[13:29:48] <Eviltwin> Then the listeners on the html
[13:30:05] <chovy> Eviltwin: i'm with ya so far.
[13:30:06] <acidjazz> warrenparsons: there definitely is a <div class="friends">
[13:30:13] <Eviltwin> So what live does is it binds to html
[13:30:15] <insign> $('.expandido,.recolhido').click(function(e){ ... it will work? two classes?
[13:30:24] <Eviltwin> So it gets notified of any click in the html
[13:30:29] <Eviltwin> Then it checks what was clicked
[13:30:35] <Eviltwin> And if that matches the selector you used
[13:30:39] <Eviltwin> It runs your code
[13:30:58] <chovy> ok
[13:31:08] <Eviltwin> But you're probably not interested in every click on the page
[13:31:14] <chovy> so it compares e.target against hte selector used in .live() ?
[13:31:20] <Eviltwin> Yes
[13:31:48] <Eviltwin> But binding to the document means it's checking *every* click
[13:31:59] <Eviltwin> And you may only be interested in clicks inside a certain table
[13:32:04] <Eviltwin> Or some other region of the page
[13:32:20] <Eviltwin> So what they did with .delegate is allow you to specify your context
[13:32:35] <Eviltwin> Where in the DOM it should be listening
[13:32:36] <warrenparsons> acidjazz: Stupid question: Are you running the check before the element is in the page (like before document ready)?
[13:33:01] <acidjazz> warrenparsons: no but not a stupid questoin
[13:33:06] <Eviltwin> So rather than $("#mytable a").live("click",...)
[13:33:07] <acidjazz> the f.i() is called at the bottom
[13:33:23] <Eviltwin> Which will bind to document and have to do some processing for every click
[13:33:38] <chovy> ok
[13:33:41] <Eviltwin> I can do $("#mytable").delegate("a","click",...)
[13:33:44] <chovy> inefficient obviously
[13:33:48] <warrenparsons> acidjazz: Did you try console.log( typeof $('.friends') );
[13:33:51] <Eviltwin> And it will listen for clicks only inside #mytable
[13:33:57] <Eviltwin> And then check to see if it was on an A tag
[13:33:59] <warrenparsons> Though that may come back with object either way...
[13:34:08] <Eviltwin> The on syntax is a lot like the delegate syntax
[13:34:25] <Eviltwin> $("#mytable").on("click","a",...)
[13:34:37] <Eviltwin> Just reversed
[13:34:51] <Eviltwin> It actually is bind, delegate, and live all rolled into one
[13:34:51] <acidjazz> http://jsfiddle.net/kHnZv/
[13:34:56] <acidjazz> warrenparsons: trying
[13:35:09] <chovy> Eviltwin: .on() is?
[13:35:36] <Eviltwin> If you do $("a").bind("click",function(){}), it actually ends up running $("a").on("click",function(){})
[13:35:42] <acidjazz> warrenparsons: taht line itself gave me an object expected error
[13:36:02] <chovy> Eviltwin: ok
[13:36:16] <Eviltwin> If you do $("#mytable").delegate("a","click",function(){}), it actually ends up running $("#mytable").on("click","a",function(){})
[13:36:36] <chovy> would $("#mytable a").on('click', ?, function(){ }); be valid syntax? Not sure what selector (?) should be in this case.
[13:36:43] <Eviltwin> And if you do $("a").live("click",function(){}), it actually ends up running $(document).on("click","a",function(){})
[13:37:04] <chovy> Eviltwin: ok
[13:37:13] <Eviltwin> So there are potentially two selectors involved here
[13:37:34] <Eviltwin> $("[alpha]").on("click","[bravo]",function(){});
[13:37:44] <Eviltwin> What happens when you run that
[13:37:56] <Eviltwin> Is it finds all elements that currently match [alpha]
[13:38:03] <Eviltwin> And binds a click listener to them
[13:38:12] <Eviltwin> Then when those listeners get triggered
[13:38:18] <Eviltwin> It checks if e.target matches [bravo]
[13:38:29] <Eviltwin> And if it does, it runs your function
[13:38:30] <acidjazz> warrenparsons: its pretty bizarre i think i have a doctype or some html issue
[13:38:38] <warrenparsons> acidjazz: http://jsfiddle.net/warrenparsons/kHnZv/2/
[13:38:49] <Eviltwin> chovy: Does that make sense?
[13:39:24] <chovy> Eviltwin: yes
[13:39:28] <chovy> I only have one question.
[13:39:52] <chovy> what's the impact of doing these two:
[13:39:53] <chovy> $("div").on("click", "a", function(){});
[13:39:53] <chovy> $("div a").on("click", function(){});
[13:40:11] <Eviltwin> First one binds to every DIV currently in the page
[13:40:12] <someprimetime> what would be the best way to handle loading of social widgets (Facebook, stumble upon, twitter)? right now, i have an event that when you mouseover, it calls the scripts using $.load() on the containerâ€¦ but would it be better to set a timeout and load them after that expires than have the user have to wait for the data to get sent back with the load() method?
[13:40:13] <acidjazz> problem is i cant do a w3 test cuz its a darn iframe :(
[13:40:20] <Eviltwin> And listens for any click events there
[13:40:32] <Eviltwin> And if e.target matches "a" (as a descentant)
[13:40:33] <warrenparsons> acidjazz: Can you copy the source of the iframe and paste it into the validator?
[13:40:38] <Eviltwin> It is run
[13:40:50] <Eviltwin> The second takes all A tags that are in a DIV right now
[13:40:56] <Eviltwin> And binds to each of them
[13:41:09] <Eviltwin> In the first case, if you add new DIVs, they will be ignored
[13:41:20] <Eviltwin> But if you add new As to existing DIVs
[13:41:21] <Eviltwin> They won't
[13:41:26] <acidjazz> warrenparsons: not ab ad idea
[13:41:28] <Eviltwin> In the second case
[13:41:38] <Eviltwin> There's nothing dynamic
[13:41:44] <Eviltwin> Adding new DIVs or As
[13:41:47] <Eviltwin> Both will be ignored
[13:41:51] <chovy> ok
[13:42:17] <Eviltwin> Also, if you end up binding to more than 3 elements
[13:42:31] <chovy> so I need to use .on() and have foo be the lowest static element $(foo).on('click', "path to links", fn);
[13:42:33] <Eviltwin> And you can produce the same desired effect with a delegate instead
[13:42:37] <Eviltwin> The delegate is faster
[13:43:17] <Eviltwin> If the DOM's not changing
[13:43:20] <M4d3L1> something am doing wrong on that : http://paste2.org/p/1782592  anyone can help me?
[13:43:49] <Eviltwin> $("[alpha] [bravo]").on("click",function(){}) does the same thing as $("[alpha]").on("click","[bravo]",function(){})
[13:43:50] <JKarsrud> M4d3L1: yeah, setAttribute isn't a jQuery function
[13:43:51] <chovy> Eviltwin: most of my stuff is dynamic, so I shouldn't use delegate because it's only useful if everything is static?
[13:43:57] <JKarsrud> see ?attr instead :)
[13:43:57] <Eviltwin> (Assuming the DOM doesn't change)
[13:43:58] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[13:44:06] <Eviltwin> If that helps you understand how the two selectors work together
[13:44:17] <Eviltwin> chovy: Other way around
[13:44:38] <Eviltwin> If you're doing a lot of dynamic stuff, definitely use delegate
[13:44:54] <Eviltwin> To differentiate the three different concepts
[13:45:00] <Eviltwin> I call them bind, live, and delegate
[13:45:09] <Eviltwin> Because that's what they were originally
[13:45:15] <Eviltwin> Now it's suggested that you do all three with .on
[13:45:28] <Eviltwin> And in fact bind, live, and delegate call .on
[13:45:48] <Eviltwin> So the idea is this
[13:45:53] <Eviltwin> [alpha] is static
[13:45:58] <Eviltwin> [bravo] is dynamic
[13:46:20] <Eviltwin> In $("[alpha]").on("click","[bravo]",function(){})
[13:46:54] <chovy> Ok
[13:47:03] <Eviltwin> Does that make sense?
[13:47:04] <chovy> I'm still confused on when to use .on() vs. .delegate()
[13:47:20] <Eviltwin> That's what I was trying to explain
[13:47:24] <chovy> $("static").on('click', 'dynamic', fn); is correct?
[13:47:40] <Eviltwin> bind, delegate, and live are the pre-1.7 syntaxes for these things
[13:47:50] <Eviltwin> Now all of those can be done through on
[13:48:03] <Eviltwin> Just by passing in the right things
[13:48:08] <Eviltwin> Yes, that is correct
[13:48:11] <chovy> if .delegate calls .on() why would i use .delegate.
[13:48:20] <Eviltwin> It's backwards-compatability
[13:48:35] <chovy> i see
[13:48:37] <Eviltwin> But it's useful terminology
[13:48:38] <fredzakje> anyone has experience with moorainbow colorpicker and ajax update?
[13:48:44] <chovy> so .on is better if i'm using 1.7
[13:48:52] <Eviltwin> When explaining the differences between the three syntaxes
[13:48:56] <Eviltwin> Yes, use .on if you're using 1.7
[13:49:05] <Eviltwin> No reason not to
[13:49:18] <chovy> and delegeate still requires $(static).delegate('dynamic', 'click', fn);
[13:49:26] <acidjazz> yup an unmathced div in IE9 means object expected ALL OVER HTE PLACE
[13:49:33] <Eviltwin> Yes, the first two arguments are reversed
[13:49:35] <Eviltwin> Like you showed there
[13:49:57] <chovy> The first argument can still be dynamic? or does that selector have to be static too.
[13:50:12] <fredzakje> howcome my js doesnt work anymore after an ajax call?
[13:50:32] <ryanneufeld> ?ftjq @ fredzakje
[13:50:32] <bot-t> fredzakje, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[13:50:58] <Eviltwin> chovy: $("[static]").delegate("[dynamic]","click",function(){}) === $("[static]").on("click","[dynamic]",function(){})
[13:52:14] <Eviltwin> They mean the exact same thing. The only difference is that switch there with the first two args
[13:52:26] <chovy> Eviltwin: i see.
[13:52:39] <Eviltwin> And $("[dynamic]").live("click",function(){}) === $(document).on("click","[dynamic]",function(){})
[13:52:41] <chovy> that makes sense now.
[13:54:55] <ragas> if your class="has a space" how do you use it as a selector? $('has a space').hide(); doesnt work
[13:55:17] <chovy> ragas: .foo.bar
[13:55:18] <ajpiano> "a class" can't have spaces, each one is treated as a separate class
[13:55:23] <Eviltwin> ragas: Those are technically parsed as three separate classes
[13:55:25] <ajpiano> $(".has.a.space")
[13:55:29] <chovy> ragas: yes, those are two classes.
[13:56:02] <Eviltwin> Which also means their order doesn't matter
[13:56:03] <chovy> Eviltwin: thanks for the expert explanation. I'm going to put a jsfiddle up
[13:56:54] <ProLoser|Work> if i want to search a string for USEFUL keywords, are there libs for that?
[13:57:11] <ProLoser|Work> like that ignore terms such as "and, or, in, on, &, -" etc?
[13:57:28] <Eviltwin> Libs in what language?
[13:57:31] <ragas> Awesome TYajpiano, eviltwin
[13:59:15] <ravenzz> ProLoser|Work http://developer.yahoo.com/search/content/V1/termExtraction.html
[14:01:18] <ProLoser|Work> ravenzz: is it okay to use that for likeâ€¦ common searches?
[14:01:22] <ProLoser|Work> like if it's used a lot?
[14:01:26] <ProLoser|Work> or is there some sort of lib?
[14:04:15] <kitikonti> anyone here who could tell me why my little plugin dont work? http://jsfiddle.net/kitikonti/KNmD2/1/ this line dont get triggerd $('.imageselect').delegate(' li.selected','click',function() {
[14:04:28] <amid_hasan> does anyone know how to implement search functionality like airbnb.com? they have when you change an option it updates the query results on the page.
[14:05:25] <ravenzz> ProLoser|Work it extracts some 'relevant' keywords from a paragraph/sentence
[14:07:31] <smplstk> Eviltwin, the order of classes does matter, it impacts inheritance.
[14:07:48] <Eviltwin> smplstk: I mean in a selector
[14:13:02] <chaosbringer> hey guys and gals, quick question
[14:13:10] <chaosbringer> on the .change function
[14:13:20] <chaosbringer> is there a way to retrieve the element that it was changed from
[14:13:21] <chaosbringer> ?
[14:13:51] <chaosbringer> example: elementA was selected, elementB was now selected (thus .change()) triggers, how can i pick up that elementA was previously selected?
[14:15:50] <chaosbringer> the previous ID would also work
[14:16:34] <jwmann> Can I animate the opacity for IE? (via filter)
[14:18:03] <rroelofs> chaosbringer: the event fires on the element that changed and jquery kindly binds 'this' to the dom element for you
[14:19:55] <chaosbringer> right, however, lets say i have an array of radio buttons, one is selected, when the user selects a new one, i want to know, which one was selected (at that point "this" would hold the one the user changed it to right?)
[14:20:01] <chaosbringer> rroelofs?
[14:20:24] <chaosbringer> which one was previously selected, and which one is currently selected by the user* rather
[14:22:08] <chaosbringer> i thought the event variable passed to the function had the previously selected element in it
[14:22:48] <chovy> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/z6BvR/
[14:22:49] <rroelofs> it has the element that changed
[14:23:00] <chovy> This pretty much does what I expect based on youro explanation.
[14:24:23] <Eviltwin> chovy: Good
[14:25:45] <chaosbringer> rroelofs: this holds the element to which it CHANGED TO, i want to also know which one it CHANGED FROM.
[14:25:53] <ProLoser|Work> is there a simple way to utf8 encode a string?
[14:26:14] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: What do you mean by that?
[14:27:25] <rroelofs> chaosbringer: The change event is for when the 'value' of something changes, not when the user swicthes from one field to another.  you want blur and focus
[14:27:34] <chaosbringer> no
[14:27:38] <chaosbringer> I have radio buttons
[14:28:08] <chaosbringer> one is selected, the user changes to a different value, i want to know onchange, which one was previously selected (if any) and which one it was changed to
[14:29:03] <SmartTowel> chaosbringer.  http://jsfiddle.net/9yPfT/4/
[14:30:10] <velts> anyone know how to get layerX and layerY with jquery?
[14:30:23] <velts> i do not see it in the event object
[14:31:03] <Eviltwin> velts: Did you check the originalEvent object?
[14:32:02] <velts> ahh
[14:32:05] <velts> there it is :)
[14:32:07] <velts> thx
[14:32:54] <chaosbringer> SmartTowel: http://jsfiddle.net/9yPfT/9/
[14:33:42] <chaosbringer> Thats more similar to what i need
[14:33:50] <chaosbringer> blur doesnt work on those it seems like
[14:35:23] <aaronmcadam> doesn't work on what?
[14:38:23] <SmartTowel> chaos, one moment plz
[14:38:45] <rroelofs> chaosbringer: you are correct that blur isn't firing.  Change is firing and points to the changed element
[14:38:51] <ProLoser|Work> how do i make $.ajax() use jsonp?
[14:38:57] <chaosbringer> yeah, i want the one it changed from :)
[14:39:00] <chaosbringer> im pretty sure
[14:39:06] <chaosbringer> that if you include .change(event)
[14:39:22] <chaosbringer> event contains the previous element, but i just dont remember how to  get it
[14:39:56] <Eviltwin> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event
[14:40:00] <SmartTowel> wherid.  only doesn't work in chrome.
[14:40:47] <SmartTowel> chaos, but even in FF, if i click on B2, B1 triggers event, but B2 won't be selected.
[14:41:36] <chaosbringer> and i thought about using prevent default, selecting the element and then resuming
[14:41:46] <chaosbringer> but there is no such function as resume default, you would have to fake it
[14:42:11] <SmartTowel> chaos, here u go.
[14:42:12] <SmartTowel> http://jsfiddle.net/54y69/10/
[14:42:24] <SmartTowel> donzo
[14:43:34] <SmartTowel> chaos, that work for ya?
[14:43:44] <chaosbringer> im on chrome
[14:43:49] <chaosbringer> but im not seeing the previously selected value
[14:44:12] <chaosbringer> like, when i change from value1 to value 2
[14:44:22] <chaosbringer> i need to know value1 was previously selected
[14:44:56] <SmartTowel> chaos, one moment plz.
[14:45:15] <rroelofs> chaosbringer: I just store the value on each change and look it up from where I stashed it.
[14:47:00] <SmartTowel> chaos, you can try using jQuery().data() method
[14:47:16] <SmartTowel> add a flag to the element.  keep switching that flag as you click.
[14:48:01] <SmartTowel> so when button 1 is clicked you do jQuery(this).data('lastClicked',true);
[14:48:11] <SmartTowel> boom goes the dynamite.
[14:48:54] <Eviltwin> But sane people wouldn't do jQuery(this)
[14:48:56] <Eviltwin> They'd do $(this)
[14:49:04] <SmartTowel> well yea
[14:49:54] <JesperA> http://api.jquery.com/load/ <--- but i want to load the element of the url in the <a href i am clicking on, not a predetirminenenienfienied link in the function
[14:50:04] <JesperA> Anyone got any example of that?
[14:50:05] <chaosbringer> Eviltwin: the reason for using jQuery(this) vs $(this) is simply for compatibility purposes
[14:50:21] <chaosbringer> a lot of applications i deal with come with prototype or something else
[14:50:32] <chaosbringer> so often if we switch to jquery, we use it in compatibility mode
[14:50:33] <Eviltwin> I know
[14:50:45] <Eviltwin> $ is simply used as an alias for jQuery by default
[14:50:50] <chaosbringer> yea
[14:50:58] <chaosbringer> :)
[14:51:02] <SmartTowel> sorry for the jQuery.  we use no conflict mode in the office so its jQuery all day instead of $
[14:51:05] <SmartTowel> but yea, use $
[14:51:18] <chaosbringer> i use no conflict mode here too SmartTowel
[14:51:27] <chaosbringer> so no trouble there :)
[14:51:42] <SmartTowel> lol, nice.
[14:52:24] <chaosbringer> it sucks that the quickest solution is using .data tho, since i have a lot of different arrays that require this
[14:52:57] <Cokegod> since updating to jquery 1.7 event.pageX and event.pageY don't work anymore, why?
[14:54:03] <ProLoser|Work> how do i do cross-domain requests with $.ajax?
[14:54:13] <Eviltwin> You can't do cross-domain AJAX
[14:54:25] <ProLoser|Work> i thought that's what jsonp is for?
[14:54:33] <Eviltwin> JSONP isn't AJAX
[14:54:52] <ProLoser|Work> so what should i do?
[14:55:05] <Eviltwin> Do you know how JSONP works?
[14:55:12] <Cokegod> since updating to jquery 1.7 event.pageX and event.pageY don't work anymore with dragover event, can you please help me?
[14:55:21] <ProLoser|Work> you pass a callback function to the url
[14:55:25] <ProLoser|Work> or the name of one i think
[14:55:38] <ProLoser|Work> and the server calls it when it's done processing
[14:55:47] <ProLoser|Work> i am not 100% sure if the endpoint supports it though
[14:56:07] <ProLoser|Work> trying to use it with this: http://developer.yahoo.com/search/content/V1/termExtraction.html
[14:56:37] <frewsxcv> JSONP is commonly used with Ajax, not AJAX
[14:56:47] <SmartTowel> choas, yea that does suck.  i am sure there is other ways.  but from what i've worked with, this seems like the way to go for now.  if i come across something else tho ill let u know.
[14:57:33] <frewsxcv> well i guess not Ajax, since it doesn't us XHR
[14:57:34] <Cokegod> why don't the event.pageX and event.pageY properties work with dragover event in jquery 1.7?
[14:58:50] <Eviltwin> JSONP can be done with $.ajax
[14:59:22] <frewsxcv> that doesn't make it Ajax
[14:59:55] <ProLoser|Work> what?
[15:00:14] <ProLoser|Work> instead of nitpicking simple mistakes, perhaps you can help me reach a solution?
[15:00:41] <Cokegod> then i guess i am not going to get any answer here?
[15:01:08] <frewsxcv> Cokegod: what issue are you running into
[15:01:13] <aaronmcadam> Cokegod: they're not standard properties
[15:01:32] <aaronmcadam> so they're being removed from Chrome, well already removed from trunk
[15:01:32] <frewsxcv> Cokegod: JSONP should work with .ajax
[15:01:38] <ravenz> ProLoser|Work http://jsfiddle.net/9vqBH/
[15:01:49] <Eviltwin> frewsxcv: I never said JSONP was AJAX
[15:01:53] <Eviltwin> The two almost couldn't be more different
[15:02:17] <frewsxcv> Eviltwin: congrats
[15:02:22] <aaronmcadam> yql is a nice workaround there
[15:02:38] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: http://jsfiddle.net/KXF38/
[15:02:43] <aaronmcadam> but websockets are where it's at
[15:02:45] <Cokegod_> My browser got stuck
[15:03:05] <aaronmcadam> Cokegod_: they're not standard properties
[15:03:15] <aaronmcadam> Cokegod_ that's why they've been removed
[15:03:32] <aaronmcadam> Chrome trunk will throw an error
[15:03:36] <ProLoser|Work> don't need an appid?
[15:03:37] <Cokegod_> but the documentation doesn't say anything about it
[15:03:41] <aaronmcadam> on 16 it throws a warning
[15:03:47] <Cokegod_> and they work on click event for example
[15:03:49] <aaronmcadam> yes it does, well, the blog post does
[15:03:56] <ravenz> ProLoser|Work it does
[15:03:58] <JesperA> Is it possible to lazy load something with jQuery depending on an element have a special class? Like, if a div have class="cake", and then addclass .lazyload to .cake, and when it does, it start loading images in that div?
[15:04:03] <ProLoser|Work> oh right, you used yahoo demo
[15:05:06] <Eviltwin> frewsxcv: You could try being helpful in the future instead of nitpicking
[15:05:16] <aaronmcadam> JesperA: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
[15:05:35] <Cokegod_> ok, e.originalEvent.pageY works with dragover event, thanks
[15:05:57] <Cokegod_> although it is weird that they work with click event and not with dragover event
[15:06:12] <aaronmcadam> that could be the reason
[15:06:19] <aaronmcadam> maybe they're non standard on drag events
[15:06:25] <aaronmcadam> it's part of Gecko
[15:06:33] <aaronmcadam> not the W3C
[15:06:42] <bartmax> JesperA: depends, does the src value loaded into the element, if yes, don't looks like it can be done.
[15:06:58] <bartmax> if instead, you use a src=placeholder and then a data-real-src, yes it's possible and easy to do
[15:06:59] <aaronmcadam> JesperA: try that plugin, looks good
[15:07:04] <Cokegod_> is there documentation for drag events in W3C?
[15:07:18] <JesperA> aaronmcadam i think that is only for lazyload stuff below the fold
[15:07:31] <SmartTowel> cokegod, i got some useful docs.  one moment plz.
[15:07:47] <aaronmcadam> have u tried it
[15:08:04] <aaronmcadam> ?mdc drag
[15:08:10] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Drag and drop - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop
[15:08:13] <JesperA> bartmax but like, if i add the image link in rel="linktoimage.jpg" instead and then with jQuery change rel to src, would that work?
[15:08:29] <aaronmcadam> yeah it would do
[15:08:31] <bartmax> JesperA: yes.
[15:08:38] <JesperA> ok great, i try it out then
[15:08:39] <SmartTowel> actually, that's better what i had.
[15:08:48] <bartmax> JesperA: it's better to use data-someCoolName instead of rel.
[15:08:49] <SmartTowel> lol, thanks bot
[15:08:53] <aaronmcadam> MDN will always be better :D
[15:09:01] <aaronmcadam> the best js docs ever
[15:09:11] <JesperA> bartmax ok, i will try that, thanks
[15:09:12] <bartmax> JesperA: also, remember that src="" empty makes a request to the same page. so you should use a placeholder
[15:09:15] <aaronmcadam> now with user contributions too
[15:09:17] <Cokegod_> I love MDN but some things there are not working with other browsers
[15:09:18] <bartmax> JesperA: something like src="blank.gif"
[15:09:21] <Cokegod_> =[
[15:09:26] <JesperA> yeah true
[15:09:32] <aaronmcadam> Cokegod_: comment the docs!
[15:09:35] <aaronmcadam> please!
[15:09:54] <SmartTowel> someone have good doc/refrenece on building a state machine in jquery?
[15:10:05] <aaronmcadam> Cokegod_: http://placehold.it/ :D
[15:10:11] <Eviltwin> SmartTowel: A state machine?
[15:10:35] <SmartTowel> Players set pieces (state 1)
[15:10:41] <SmartTowel> Game is ready to be played (state 2)
[15:10:44] <SmartTowel> etc, etc
[15:10:55] <aaronmcadam> right yeah
[15:11:00] <Cokegod_> aaronmcadam: how is this related to anything I said
[15:11:03] <aaronmcadam> I know what u mean SmartTowel
[15:11:13] <Eviltwin> Not sure how that has anything to do with jQuery
[15:11:17] <aaronmcadam> wrong user chill out man
[15:11:28] <aaronmcadam> course it does
[15:11:28] <Cokegod_> lol ok
[15:11:46] <aaronmcadam> SmartTowel: you could use pubsub
[15:12:05] <aaronmcadam> or the mediator pattern
[15:12:27] <aaronmcadam> SmartTowel: https://gist.github.com/1363591 and http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[15:12:42] <SmartTowel> both sound like good options.  but this will be used for very basic applications.  so for example, 'Checkers' in HTML5
[15:13:09] <aaronmcadam> right yeah but just cuz they have fancy names doesn't mean they can't be used easily
[15:13:20] <SmartTowel> boom, yep thats what im looking for aaron.
[15:13:23] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[15:13:32] <aaronmcadam> give it a go dude
[15:13:44] <aaronmcadam> it will let you decouple the different concerns of your game
[15:14:03] <aaronmcadam> like generating the board, writing to a tile, keeping score, etc
[15:14:04] <SmartTowel> pub sub right?
[15:14:07] <aaronmcadam> yup
[15:14:24] <aaronmcadam> mediator is slightly different in that you have one object that controls the others
[15:14:34] <aaronmcadam> with an event emitter or notify
[15:14:38] <aaronmcadam> one mine got slides on that
[15:15:38] <aaronmcadam> SmartTowel: skip forward a few slides http://www.slideshare.net/nzakas/scalable-javascript-application-architecture
[15:15:47] <aaronmcadam> tho i do recommend reading the whole thing
[15:15:57] <aaronmcadam> I saw the talk at a conference recently, really good stuff
[15:17:16] <Daghdha> is it possible to add parameters to calls like:  $(".UpperRED").each(function ()
[15:17:20] <aaronmcadam> SmartTowel: from slide 59 onwards
[15:17:23] <Daghdha> Si i pass a value to the function
[15:18:18] <aaronmcadam> Daghdha: yeah, see ?tias
[15:18:18] <bot-t> Daghdha, Try It And See
[15:18:26] <Daghdha> ?tias
[15:18:26] <bot-t> Try It And See
[15:18:44] <aaronmcadam> hehe bot fail there dude :)
[15:19:48] <Daghdha> what is ?tias? i google on the website but see nothing
[15:19:52] <aaronmcadam> dude
[15:19:56] <aaronmcadam> read the words
[15:19:59] <aaronmcadam> it's a sentence
[15:20:00] <VoiDeT> Hey, query 1.7, in ie8 i can't access param values via $('param[name="paramname"]').val(), returns undefined, but ie7 and 9 work as expected
[15:20:04] <aaronmcadam> meaing try it out?
[15:20:06] <aaronmcadam> meaning*
[15:20:55] <aaronmcadam> VoiDeT: have you tried .prop() maybe?
[15:20:59] <Daghdha> i have no idea how i would declare that so i cannot try it out
[15:21:08] <VoiDeT> aaronmcadam: no, i will have a look
[15:21:13] <aaronmcadam> put what you're trying on jsfiddle
[15:21:30] <aaronmcadam> the code u wrote Daghdha will work
[15:21:50] <Daghdha> I know, but i want a parameter to pass to the function.
[15:21:59] <Daghdha> is it possible to add parameters to calls like:  $(".UpperRED").each(function (MyFantasticParameter)
[15:22:08] <Eviltwin> No
[15:22:08] <Daghdha> Wich i can then use inside the function
[15:22:10] <aaronmcadam> right
[15:22:11] <Eviltwin> This is where you use closure
[15:22:15] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:22:20] <VoiDeT> aaronmcadam: still undefined
[15:22:23] <aaronmcadam> wrap it another function
[15:23:16] <aaronmcadam> or what i'd do is define the func outside the each
[15:23:43] <aaronmcadam> and call it with the func( index, el ){ myfunc(mycrazyparam) })
[15:24:20] <aaronmcadam> ?each
[15:24:20] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:26:35] <renic> hello
[15:26:57] <renic> anyone ever used trent richardson's datetime picker? http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[15:27:35] <renic> I find that the examples work fine as displayed... but when I try to use it, it doesn't work in chrome.  works fine in firefox.... trying to figure out why.
[15:27:47] <aaronmcadam> Daghdha: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/aRxax/
[15:28:37] <VoiDeT> looks like i'm experiencing this http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9597
[15:29:47] <aaronmcadam> shit ur fooked then
[15:29:53] <aaronmcadam> sorry VoiDeT
[15:32:13] <aaronmcadam> VoiDeT: jump on #jquery-dev if u want to ask if the ticket is completely unfixable
[15:32:31] <aaronmcadam> though it looks like it
[15:36:59] <VoiDeT> thanks aaronmcadam
[15:37:31] <aaronmcadam> is there no other way u can do what u need
[15:37:40] <aaronmcadam> what are you doing with the param val?
[15:40:58] <sarkis> hey guys how can i parse something from the url that looks like this:  $/?foo_id=12345
[15:41:02] <sarkis> er
[15:41:09] <sarkis> #/?foo_id=12345
[15:41:12] <Daghdha> aaronmcadam: In your example you are already inside the function when you pass the parameter. I want topass into it a value i have determined above the $('div').each
[15:41:45] <aaronmcadam> yeah what's the issue Daghdha
[15:41:54] <aaronmcadam> I have defined the param above the each
[15:42:37] <aaronmcadam> on line 4
[15:42:56] <Daghdha> Oh i think i get it now.
[15:43:00] <aaronmcadam> hah kk
[15:47:41] * Daghdha plugs ears and runs teh code
[15:52:29] <Daghdha> Omg it actually works
[15:53:01] <cgiGeek> .
[16:07:46] <BlaDe^> is there a .get()  that returns a jQuery object not html?
[16:10:53] <coldhead> so much for nap time
[16:11:03] <coldhead> ?eq @ BlaDe^
[16:11:03] <bot-t> BlaDe^, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[16:11:14] <dnsdds> Is there a way to stop jQuery from interpreting a line break as an object?
[16:11:52] <coldhead> i am unfamiliar with that feature, dnsdds. do you have an example?
[16:13:39] <dnsdds> coldhead: I have a string like "<p>foo</p>\n<p>bar</p>" and when I do $(string).length, it comes up with 3. the objects are as follows; "<p>foo</p>", "Text" and "<p>bar</p>"
[16:14:28] <dnsdds> Data of this Text is "â†µ", so I'm assuming it means a line break
[16:19:59] <VoiDeT> how can i convert html to a jquery object
[16:20:42] <ShaunR> i'm trying to use jqueryui's position to center a element on the page, what would i use for of:?  i'm thinking $('<body>') but thats not really working.
[16:22:15] <someprimetime> what's the best way to handle loading social widgets?
[16:39:39] <dnsdds> Anybody's got any idea?
[16:40:41] <iamcurio> is there a quick way to add a class to the active link in a list menu?
[16:41:20] <dw> live events maybe?
[16:42:15] <dw> $('li:hover', '#your_list').live('mouseover', function() { $(this).addClass('foo'); });
[16:42:22] <dw> warning: i never used live events. that might be complete shit
[16:42:50] <wwalser> dnsdds: why do you need to pass the wring to jQuery?
[16:42:57] <wwalser> strugin*
[16:43:05] <wwalser> ... string*  (this is going well)
[16:43:07] <Eviltwin> dw: Don't use .live
[16:43:19] <Eviltwin> Use .on or if you can't use on, use .delegate
[16:43:42] <dw> Eviltwin: if i have a choice i don't use jQuery to begin with ;)
[16:43:52] <Eviltwin> Why not?
[16:44:13] <dw> it's nice for small hacks. i've yet to see a large app that survives its api design though
[16:44:31] <wwalser> Eviltwin: You should just ignore stuff like that, it's flame bait.
[16:44:51] <dw> "this offends me, i better plug my ears"
[16:44:55] <Eviltwin> wwalser: It's okay, I can spot the idiots when I see them :D
[16:45:17] <wwalser> Eviltwin: I didn't say he was an idiot, he's a very smart individual
[16:45:19] <dw> it's not flame bait. lazy developers + chaining = 200 character long lines of crap, multiplied by a year's development = crock of spaghetti
[16:46:22] <dw> if you haven't seen the maintainability travesty that causes, you probably aren't working on big enough apps. :)
[16:46:34] <Eviltwin> No, I'm just working with good devs
[16:46:40] <wwalser> ding ding ding
[16:46:41] <ajpiano> anyone who writes large apps crappily using jQuery would have done so without jQuery as well
[16:46:44] <Eviltwin> Who don't chain to infinity
[16:46:54] <Eviltwin> Exactly
[16:46:58] <DOSBeats> Hi
[16:47:01] <ajpiano> the idea that jQuery is somehow responsible for people who don't know how to organise large apps using it
[16:47:04] <ajpiano> is bunk
[16:47:43] <Eviltwin> Chaining is arguably much cleaner when it's done right
[16:47:50] <ajpiano> it's like saying "i know hammers are useful, but i've never seen AN ENTIRE HOUSE built ONLY with a hammer! hammers suck!"
[16:47:57] <DOSBeats> <!-- Hiphopapotamus
[16:48:01] <wwalser> It's not that I want to plug my ears either, I'd love to discuss it in person, but this is an internet chat room. Remarks like that are pure bait 99% of the time. No reason to respond.
[16:48:27] <Eviltwin> I'm off. Good luck to you all.
[16:48:35] <wwalser> g'day Eviltwin
[16:48:49] <Eviltwin> I think I helped my share of people this afternoon
[16:49:02] <wwalser> DOSBeats flight of the choncords?
[16:49:09] <Eviltwin> I should start writing posts or docs or something
[16:49:12] <Eviltwin> That I can point people at
[16:49:18] <dw> ajpiano: that's true enough
[16:49:27] <dw> but in practice, the design encourages it
[16:49:36] <dw> chaining is nice, for one or two method calls max
[16:49:49] <Eviltwin> dw: Break line and indent
[16:50:08] <dw> Eviltwin: then you tickle javascript's implicit semicolon rules, which again encourages idiots :)
[16:50:21] <ajpiano> the idea that this discussion can be laid at the feet solely of "chaining" is oversimplification anyhow
[16:50:22] <dw> i like jQuery, i just don't use it for large projects
[16:50:24] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: you should
[16:50:40] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: do you know about https://github.com/jquery/web-learn-jquery-com
[16:50:51] <dw> true. but its not the only complaint (namespacing is probably #2 on the list)
[16:50:53] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: I keep meaing to make something
[16:50:59] <Eviltwin> Maybe even kind of bloggy
[16:51:11] <ajpiano> the entire idea of it is so folks like us *have* stuff to link to for these situations that arise over and over again
[16:51:11] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Haven't seen that no
[16:51:32] <Eviltwin> What's it do?
[16:51:41] <ajpiano> well, we're trying to get it launched by the end of the year - and "content refinement and expansion" is a major need area :)
[16:52:01] <ajpiano> it's basically... the jquery fundamentals book
[16:52:02] <Eviltwin> I'll poke through it when I'm free again later
[16:52:09] <ajpiano> repurposed, backed by git and markdown
[16:52:29] <Eviltwin> My goal was kind of knowedgebase-ish
[16:52:33] <ajpiano> so that we have a compendium of authoritative information on how to use jquery and deal with all sorts of problems, in one place
[16:52:37] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: that's ours too :)
[16:52:51] <Eviltwin> A series of small articles focused on common issues
[16:52:55] <Eviltwin> Or common enough issues
[16:53:00] <ajpiano> that's the idea here
[16:53:02] <Eviltwin> Cool
[16:53:10] <Eviltwin> Definitely will poke at it then
[16:53:16] <ajpiano> see if you can't get it running later, i'm happy to help you do so
[16:53:30] <ajpiano> would be killer to get you on board :)
[16:53:58] <Eviltwin> I started making myself a little catalog of jsFiddles I've written for people
[16:54:11] <Eviltwin> So I can relink people later
[16:54:29] <Eviltwin> Realized that doesn't scale as well as I'd like
[16:54:40] <Eviltwin> Hard to put lots of nice english in there
[16:54:59] <ajpiano> yeah
[16:55:08] <Eviltwin> I'll check this out later. Gotta go now.
[16:55:16] <ajpiano> addy has been working on a whole thing for automatically creating fiddles and stuff rom the example content here
[16:55:19] <ajpiano> not merged in yet
[16:55:20] <ajpiano> ok ttyl
[16:55:24] <Eviltwin> Nice
[16:55:42] <chovy> :wqa
[16:56:21] <iamcurio> how do i change this: $("li").addClass("active"); to add only to the active li rather than all of thems
[16:57:16] <dw> iamcurio: are you familiar with the :hover CSS selector?
[16:57:37] <iamcurio> dw: not really
[16:57:54] <dw> iamcurio: i think it does what you want, in pure CSS.     li:hover { /* content of your .active rules here */ }
[16:58:52] <iamcurio> dw: il give it a go
[17:00:33] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky

[17:00:54] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[17:11:53] <PseudoHuman> Is there a better way to inject a string dynamically into a regular expression object than this? POS: eval("/:(nth|eq|gt|lt|first|last|even|odd|" + 'madonna' + ")(?:\((\d*)\))?(?=[^\-]|$)/")
[17:13:55] <appl3s> hello, do any of you use qTip?
[17:14:19] <appl3s> I konw it's a lib and perhaps you don't answer questions on that, if so I'll bugger off :)
[17:34:38] <cgiGeek> tha addclass thing looks very nice
[17:41:23] <SkyFlyer> i'm trying to select an element with 2 id tags.  like this.. how is it done?  jQuery('#tabs ul a #friday').addClass("active");
[17:42:28] <SkyFlyer> got it
[18:20:48] <hyperjxz> hi there, a noob question, if anyone could help me please... I have jquery tabs that have jquery content in them, but only the first tab works.. what am I doing incorrectly?
[18:21:39] <coldhead> one thing you're doing incorrectly is failing to provide a link to your code :)
[18:21:58] <coldhead> cause what you've said so far works fine in my imagination
[18:22:36] <hyperjxz> mmm cheers... i don't know if i will do that correcty too lol i will try though..
[18:22:39] <ProLoser|Work> i have spent most of my day at work adding quips to bugzilla from whatthecommit and xkcd.
[18:22:54] <ProLoser|Work> I feel I have accomplished a lot today
[18:23:09] <chovy> coldhead++
[18:25:07] <coldhead> ?p @ hyperjxz
[18:25:07] <bot-t> hyperjxz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[18:25:26] <coldhead> that's important work, ProLoser|Work
[18:28:27] <ryanneufeld> hai guys
[18:29:01] <coldhead> ryry <3
[18:31:03] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: <3 you too buddy
[18:33:10] <coldhead> i am struggling with what to do on my lunch break
[18:33:25] <coldhead> record store, music store or butterfly sanctuary
[18:33:53] <coldhead> it's tough, i don't mind telling you
[18:34:40] <PrgmrBill> butterfly sanctuary sounds best to me
[18:37:27] <hyperjxz> i have no idea how to post stuff in the jsfiddle but here goes... http://jsfiddle.net/pTBSr/
[18:38:17] <hyperjxz> how do i include other two pages that are content for the tabs? this way it's just a big mess...
[18:41:06] <i_0manga> Hey! If you're in the US looking to spunk/shoot your load on some wonderful girls, go to http://www.bukkakeforums.com/ and sign up. Parties are being set up in the Atlanta and Dayton areas. This is no bullshit; completely real and amateur. http://i40.tinypic.com/m7vwna.jpg http://i43.tinypic.com/2v9sojk.jpg
[18:41:28] <ryanneufeld> wow
[18:41:34] <hyperjxz> wtf?? :D
[18:41:35] <ryanneufeld> awesome...
[18:41:46] <hyperjxz> spammers?
[18:43:00] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[18:43:03] <ryanneufeld> funny stuff
[18:43:54] <hyperjxz> why would spammers come here... as if anyone here would actually sign up...
[18:47:13] <coldhead> I'M SIGNING UP RIGHT NOW
[18:47:23] <hyperjxz> could anyone look into my messy code and tell me what am i doing wrong?
[18:48:12] <hyperjxz> sign up to oasisdotcom looked good to me :)
[18:54:39] <coldhead> hyperjxz: i assume you looked at this to see a working example? http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#ajax
[18:55:20] <coldhead> i would try reloading the page with firebug/web inspector open to see if ajax requests are a) being fired and b) returing properly
[18:55:26] <coldhead> returning*
[18:55:32] <coldhead> so not 404 or 500
[18:55:53] <coldhead> but at this point: butterflies, adieu
[18:55:57] <coldhead> good luck
[18:56:21] <hyperjxz> hmm i did but didn't see anything relevant...
[18:56:50] <muzone> hyperjxz: you too blind for them butterflies
[18:57:25] <hyperjxz> it is pretty cold here for butterflies...
[18:57:32] <hyperjxz> and dark too..
[18:58:09] <muzone> nonsense
[18:58:13] <muzone> they weigh almost nothing man
[18:58:39] <muzone> what you gonna do, stab them? look how beautiful they look
[18:58:41] <muzone> matter of fact
[18:59:44] <muzone> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2o-R6U6nzZE
[19:01:49] <hyperjxz> hey i'm nothing against butterflies... i don't mind them, but there's none around here

[19:15:17] <vacho> hi
[19:15:25] <vacho> how can I rewrite this to be a live event? $('#order-edit').validationEngine('attach', {promptPosition : "centerRight", validationEventTrigger : "submit", scroll: true});
[19:15:42] <jbc> heylo peoples :)
[19:16:29] <jbc> I am slightly confused: are jquery templates here to stay, or are they going to be replaced by something else soon?
[19:17:08] <vacho> is it even possible?
[19:18:12] <jbc> oops, never mind
[19:24:42] <vacho> anyone?
[19:34:40] <vacho> guys please, I need some help with the live function, anyone?
[19:35:07] <Eviltwin> Unless it's a currently .bind, a .live won't work
[19:37:52] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to make live about it?
[19:47:41] <heshanh> can i use ajax to upload a file?
[19:47:54] <vacho> ok check this out:
[19:47:58] <vacho> http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/jquery-form-validator-because-form-validation-is-a-mess/
[19:48:13] <vacho> im using that validation engine and it works fine except on forms that are manipulated after the DOM load.
[19:48:31] <SkyFlyer> i'm trying to count all children of a div that have class .event  how can I do that?
[19:48:53] <vacho> $('#order-edit').validationEngine(); how can I run that as live, so it gets attached after the DOM manipulations?
[19:48:55] <Eviltwin> heshanh: http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
[19:49:32] <heshanh> ah ok. but can i use the usual POST to upload it?
[19:49:44] <Eviltwin> heshanh: Don't know. Haven't had to do it
[19:49:48] <vacho> Eviltwin: thanks for helping
[19:51:25] <Eviltwin> vacho: How/when is the DOM being manipulated?
[19:51:54] <vacho> I have a form and the validation used to work fine until I put the form in a shadowbox (shadowbox alters the DOM) so the validation engine stopped working.
[19:54:16] <Eviltwin> vacho: I think you want to look at the shadowbox API
[19:54:27] <Eviltwin> And see if you can get notified once those DOM manipulations are done
[19:54:58] <vacho> Eviltwin: I have a hook for when the dom manipulations are done, can I attach something right after the dom has been altered?
[20:07:41] <coldhead> new kate bush is out already
[20:15:05] <Eviltwin> vacho: Yes
[20:22:12] <vacho> Eviltwin: can I add an event handler in a function?
[20:24:34] <Eviltwin> Why not
[20:30:51] <Axsuul> when clicking off an element, do you recommend I bind the click to $('html') or $('body')
[20:31:36] <Eviltwin> I think $(document) is the standard
[20:31:44] <Eviltwin> If you want to catch all events
[20:32:58] <NewtonianB> how do I get the value of a radio box selected inside  .change(function() { }
[20:33:04] <NewtonianB> select box i mean
[20:33:19] <Eviltwin> A <select> ?
[20:33:24] <NewtonianB> yes
[20:33:31] <Axsuul> $(this)
[20:33:33] <Eviltwin> Have you tried $(this).val()
[20:34:11] <NewtonianB> -____-
[20:34:14] <NewtonianB> thanks!
[20:34:25] <NewtonianB> how do I get the displayed value though instead of value
[20:34:44] <Eviltwin> Oh, that might be a little trickier
[20:35:35] <Eviltwin> $(this).find("option[value="+$(this).val()+"]").text() maybe
[20:36:21] <Axsuul> $('#list option:selected').text() maybe
[20:36:28] <Eviltwin> Maybe
[20:36:38] <Eviltwin> $(this).find('option:selected').textz()
[20:36:54] <NewtonianB> thank you!
[20:37:00] <Eviltwin> .text()
[20:44:09] <hyperjxz> i still don't get it i have two php tabs which contain their own jquery and ajax but only the first works
[20:45:10] <hyperjxz> i swich them around but still only the first works
[20:45:25] <hyperjxz> i'm sure the code is fine
[20:46:36] <ChrisPartridge> Writing a widget at the moment, for a "private" property inside the widget - do I just store this in options, or can i specify private properties directly int he widget object?
[20:47:02] <mack_> hello
[20:47:40] <mack_> hello
[20:48:24] <coldhead> ChrisPartridge: if it's private it shouldn't be in options
[20:49:06] <coldhead> if there's a nice object available in the widget you can put it there
[20:49:18] <coldhead> or just scope it in a closure if that makes more sense
[20:50:02] <ChrisPartridge> coldhead: Would something like this - http://pastebin.com/DvDtYpjy - be acceptable?
[20:51:05] <coldhead> fine by me!
[20:51:15] <coldhead> to be honest, whatever works is acceptable
[20:51:32] <coldhead> but i try to consider the frustrated debugger in my footsteps
[20:51:37] <gordian> hello
[20:51:46] <coldhead> he shouldn't have to see irrelevant things
[20:51:52] <coldhead> he OR SHE*
[20:51:57] <coldhead> hallo gordian
[20:52:18] <gordian> i'm trying to sort out an issue with this contact form: http://radioscopeinc.cfxdesign.com/signup
[20:52:26] <ChrisPartridge> Cool, thanks coldhead :)
[20:52:56] <gordian> if you click "Subscribe" without entering anything you can see validation properly fails, but the watermarks do not return to the inputs
[20:53:18] <coldhead> how are you doing the watermarks, gordian ?
[20:53:23] <gordian> jQuery
[20:53:34] <coldhead> i highly recommend using html5 placeholder="some watermark here"
[20:53:39] <coldhead> that will make your life much simpler
[20:53:46] <gordian> hmmm
[20:53:52] <gordian> will it clear prior to submission?
[20:53:57] <coldhead> hell yes!
[20:54:05] <coldhead> it will work like a dream in modern browser
[20:54:06] <coldhead> s
[20:54:09] <gordian> ok, looking up docs...
[20:54:14] <coldhead> and i'll link you to a shim for older browsers
[20:54:27] <coldhead> which should also work fine with validate
[20:54:45] <coldhead> gordian: http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/placeholder
[20:55:24] <gordian> well, my major concern is that the placeholders will also re-appear after failed validation
[20:55:32] <coldhead> i understand
[20:55:50] <coldhead> that's why i'm recommending doing it with well defined html5 placeholder
[20:56:02] <coldhead> instead of these fancy pants watermark plugins that don't follow a standard
[20:56:06] <coldhead> and make shit up
[20:56:34] <gordian> brilliant, sounds like what i was looking for from the start
[20:56:55] <coldhead> yeah it's a really nice simple html5 timesaver
[20:57:02] <gordian> i'll give it a go
[20:57:06] <coldhead> good luck!
[20:57:21] <coldhead> the author of that plugin will be online in an hour or so if you need help
[20:57:44] <coldhead> but in chrome et al it will just work
[20:57:47] <gordian> awesome, i'll stick around then
[20:57:52] <gordian> what's chrome?
[20:57:54] <gordian> jk -)
[20:57:57] <gordian> ;-)
[20:58:00] <coldhead> >: |
[20:58:17] <gordian> actually i would be dead without chrome
[20:58:31] <gordian> and the watermark plugin i'm using has some serious issues with it
[20:58:37] <coldhead> we got our CEO on chrome and now that's all he uses
[20:58:50] <coldhead> makes development much easier
[20:59:00] <gordian> i got my wife and her parents on it
[20:59:09] <coldhead> ah yes, it's good for old people :)
[20:59:18] <coldhead> i am doing less support for grandparents
[20:59:30] <gordian> ...and try my best to get clients on it
[20:59:55] <gordian> i don't understand how people can be ok with using a 10 year old browser
[21:00:23] <coldhead> they may not realise there's an alternative?
[21:00:35] <coldhead> there are billboard ads for chrome around my city
[21:00:40] <coldhead> so that helps
[21:02:41] <gordian> coldhead
[21:02:51] <gordian> placeholder just made the last 2 days of my life a waste
[21:02:58] <gordian> i'm humbled and i thank you
[21:03:00] <coldhead> hahaha
[21:03:08] <coldhead> this is why we like placeholder :)
[21:13:14] <coldhead> someone in my dictionary's up to no good
[21:16:50] <ChrisPartridge> if I have a=$('.north'), b=$('.south') -how can i join these two collections together so I can run .each() on both at the same time?
[21:17:10] <ChrisPartridge> without destroying a/b
[21:17:51] <coldhead> a.add(b).each
[21:17:58] <coldhead> oh
[21:18:01] <coldhead> without destroing
[21:18:17] <coldhead> var c = a.clone().add(b)
[21:18:25] <coldhead> ^^ not tested but i have hopes
[21:18:31] <coldhead> ?add
[21:18:31] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[21:18:33] <coldhead> ?clone
[21:18:34] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[21:18:48] <coldhead> bot-t: thank you
[21:18:48] * bot-t sighs
[21:24:18] <hyperjxz> hey coldhead can you help me with these tabs please?
[21:24:41] <hyperjxz> i can't get it at all
[21:25:20] <da-beginner> hello #jquery! :)
[21:25:51] <thomedy617> okay iv  worked out my logic and iv realized my strings but when i use the variables for id's in my selector i get nothing
[21:25:51] <thomedy617> http://pastebin.com/TLKbeJ7E
[21:26:11] <thomedy617> if you watch firebug the console shows the right format of strings
[21:26:11] <da-beginner> how do i use a "regex"-like id matching in jquery? eg. i'd like to select $('#container_(\d)') where (\d) can be any number
[21:26:24] <thomedy617> can i not use variables as selector
[21:27:00] <Cork> da-beginner: you can't
[21:27:06] <coldhead> hyperjxz: link me to the latest?
[21:27:36] <Cork> da-beginner: you would have to repeate the id's with a comma separator; the correct way to do it is to add a class though
[21:28:14] <ngharo> da-beginner: $('div[id^="container_"]') might work
[21:28:31] <ngharo> wont match \d though of course
[21:28:46] <ngharo> "Starts with container_"
[21:29:18] <Cork> note though that that will select every div in the dom, then loop over then and look at its id attribute
[21:29:26] <hyperjxz> coldhead: there is nothing to it. i use jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js 		$('#tabs').tabs(); only the first tab that contains jquery and ajax works properly
[21:29:32] <Cork> its a really slow selector if you have many divs
[21:29:32] <thomedy617> i have a var string = .0
[21:29:34] <thomedy617> can i
[21:29:42] <thomedy617> $(string).fadeOut()
[21:29:46] <thomedy617> cuz its not working
[21:29:51] <hyperjxz> i swap tabs around but the same thing happens
[21:29:53] <thomedy617> http://pastebin.com/TLKbeJ7E
[21:30:00] <da-beginner> ngharo: what if the number is in the middle? eg. container_1_submit ?
[21:30:06] <Cork> thomedy617: .0 isn't a string
[21:30:13] <thomedy617> no it isn't that way
[21:30:18] <thomedy617> but if you look at my pastebin
[21:30:26] <thomedy617> youll see i to string it as an array
[21:30:34] <thomedy617> because i perform logic and then array it
[21:30:51] <thomedy617> i feel like im close
[21:30:53] <Cork> thomedy617: you would have to generate a live pastebin
[21:31:03] <thomedy617> wait what is a live pastebin
[21:31:05] <Cork> cause dead long code isn't easy to see what they do
[21:31:05] <coldhead> what's not working, hyperjxz ? you're not seeing the other content load? the tab content is empty? it's stuck on Loading.. ?
[21:31:06] <ngharo> da-beginner: yep.
[21:31:11] <Cork> ?p @ thomedy617
[21:31:12] <bot-t> thomedy617, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:31:25] <thomedy617> ok one sec... i ll run that real quick and thank you
[21:31:37] <Cork> thomedy617: and on a side note, why do you concat strings in arrays?
[21:32:00] <da-beginner> ngharo: yep? i mean.. i want to match container_(somedigit)_submit
[21:32:03] <Cork> thomedy617: thats just adds a big overhead to generating the final string
[21:32:23] <da-beginner> ngharo: how do i do that? $('div[id^="container_"????]')
[21:32:40] <Cork> da-beginner: as said, before you can't
[21:32:46] <Cork> use classes
[21:32:55] <ngharo> ^
[21:33:10] <Cork> da-beginner: just add a class to the elements you want to select
[21:33:16] <hyperjxz> coldhead: it loads, but it doesn't execute the function which is a form to write to database, which uses jquery and ajax. Even if i use the same exact php pages for two tabs only the first works
[21:33:17] <Cork> and do $('my-class-name')
[21:33:20] <thomedy617> http://jsfiddle.net/RjSsN/
[21:33:25] <da-beginner> Cork: ok thanks :)
[21:33:43] <ngharo> $('.my-class-name') :)
[21:33:48] <thomedy617> pay particular attention to the $(parentTarget + currentTarget).fadeOut()
[21:33:50] <thomedy617> this is my issue
[21:33:53] <thomedy617> everything else is fine
[21:34:00] <gordian> coldhead: quick issue re styling the placeholder
[21:34:05] <thomedy617> and pre thank  you]
[21:34:23] <gordian> i've styled it but the style persists on focus, any way around this?
[21:34:26] <ngharo> thomedy617: what does parentTarget + currentTarget evaluate to
[21:34:36] <thomedy617> it increases based on level or decision
[21:34:39] <Cork> thomedy617: generated selector "#level_0.0"
[21:34:40] <thomedy617> no ++
[21:34:44] <Cork> you want "#level_0 .0"
[21:34:59] <gordian> i.e., font-style: normal onfocus?
[21:34:59] <Cork> (though i'm not sure if single digits are valid class names)
[21:35:20] <thomedy617> and level++
[21:35:24] <thomedy617> even though it works in the html
[21:36:01] <Cork> thomedy617: as i said your concat is broken
[21:36:12] <thomedy617> okay... can you help me please
[21:36:31] <Cork> first why do you do ['string' + 'string'].toString() ??
[21:36:44] <Cork> thats just a waist of gc cycels
[21:36:57] <thomedy617> i googled and thats what tutorials took me to
[21:37:04] <Cork> doubt it
[21:37:13] <coldhead> hyperjxz: when jQuery loads content via ajax it strips out <script> tags
[21:37:19] <coldhead> to prevent loading things multiple times
[21:37:24] <Cork>  ['string', 'string'].join('') is what they normaly say
[21:37:29] <coldhead> is that your issue?
[21:37:45] <thomedy617> so instead of toString i should join
[21:37:56] <Cork> thomedy617: ya, and comma instead of +
[21:37:58] <coldhead> gordian: http://davidwalsh.name/html5-placeholder-css
[21:38:18] <gordian> heh, yeah i just found that one myself
[21:38:22] <thomedy617> in the selector portion because i need the child not both whill that stll work
[21:38:27] <Cork> thomedy617: what you do is take to strings generate a new string, the copy that new string into an array, then convert that array into a string again
[21:38:34] <NewtonianB> how do I overwrite the "style" tag of a div?
[21:38:42] <coldhead> gordian: i endorse it because look at the authors funny little beard :)
[21:38:46] <NewtonianB> i'm trying to set visibility in css but the style tag has visibility defined so its not overwriting
[21:38:56] <Cork> thomedy617: ['',''].join('') is a hack to get around leaks in old ie browsers
[21:38:59] <hyperjxz> coldhead: yes, it does so on the second tab, but not on the first. why is that? :S
[21:39:08] <gordian> i endorse it because it WORKS!
[21:39:16] <coldhead> hyperjxz: the first tab is not ajax loaded?
[21:39:48] <coldhead> hyperjxz: the idea is you should put all your JS in the one place, the same place that does calls tabs()
[21:39:54] <coldhead> and do whatever fancyness you need in there
[21:39:59] <Cork> thomedy617: and finally as i said before your generating the string "#level_1.0" and from your html code you want "#level_1 .0" so your missing a space
[21:40:12] <thomedy617> agreed on that last part
[21:40:22] <thomedy617> i was juust on my last portion of the code part and i hit a wall...
[21:40:27] <thomedy617> so i wasn't sure where to go
[21:40:36] <thomedy617> when i do it straight theres allways a space
[21:40:45] <thomedy617> but ive never used variables as selectors
[21:40:52] <thomedy617> so ...
[21:41:07] <coldhead> hyperjxz: check out the comments in this bug report http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4608
[21:41:09] <Cork> thomedy617: to me it feels like your overcomplicating it
[21:41:15] <thomedy617> maybe
[21:41:28] <thomedy617> if you have an easier way then im your eager and humble student
[21:41:30] <coldhead> well, the first comment anyway
[21:41:50] <coldhead> hyperjxz: i really don't have much love for or knowledge of jquery ui
[21:42:19] <coldhead> if you can wait you should ask ajpiano, he looks after people like yourself
[21:42:39] <hyperjxz> clodhead: you mean put all my scripts onto index.php and remove them from those pages that are called by the tabs?
[21:42:40] <Cork> thomedy617: just do $('#level_' + parentTargetNumber + ' .' + currentTargetNumber)
[21:42:55] <thomedy617> im retarded... thats one line and easy
[21:42:58] <thomedy617> im sorry
[21:42:58] <coldhead> hyperjxz: yes, that's kinda what i mean
[21:43:07] <coldhead> make index.php the master of all the javascript
[21:43:11] <Cork> thomedy617: no need for all that type casting and arrays and what else :P
[21:43:18] <coldhead> and the other pages are mindless peons
[21:43:18] <thomedy617> when i was developing my  logic i was using another target...  so i had to split the string and odo all this work to it
[21:43:27] <thomedy617> and then when i did my bools i added that part
[21:43:32] <thomedy617> of course your right thank you
[21:43:54] <hyperjxz> coldhead: ok i will try but i was assuming that the script would conflict..
[21:44:03] <hyperjxz> scripts*
[21:44:25] <coldhead> hyperjxz: it can be something of a black art
[21:44:48] <coldhead> these are the kinds of things that make me shy away from UI
[21:46:54] <hyperjxz> mmm well i can't really come up with a other solution for now.. i will try to do as you said if not i will wait for that person ajpiano
[21:47:17] <hyperjxz> thank you anyway :thumbs-up:
[21:47:51] <thomedy617> i think that fixed me... iwas over working it
[21:47:52] <thomedy617> thank you
[21:48:09] <coldhead> good luck hyperjxz
[21:48:57] <hyperjxz> cheers
[21:52:30] <ti1> hi all, anyone around to have a look at a simple plugin that's driving me mad?
[21:52:35] <ti1> 22 lines
[21:53:12] <Cork> ti1: its easier to say if you give a link to it
[21:53:16] <ti1> http://pastebin.com/Q91WcvEK
[21:53:22] <ti1> or i can fiddle it if you prefer
[21:53:49] <Cork> a plugin won't work on its own in jsfiddle anyway so na
[21:54:20] <ti1> oops, didn't mean to leave in that initial textnode in line 4
[21:54:32] <ti1> anyway, the add in line 7 doesn't work
[21:54:44] <Cork> ti1: are you sure you want to put the function on fn?
[21:54:49] <Cork> you don't use the selector so...
[21:55:14] <Cork> oh sorry its down there
[21:55:14] <ti1> i'd like to be able to chain it, that's why i'm adding it
[21:56:05] <ti1> so if i log elem before line 8, it shows a bunch of text nodes
[21:56:36] <ti1> but nothing ever gets added to the result collection
[21:57:10] <ti1> i tried manually adding a text node before the return on line 19, and i tried the same before line 8, but no dice
[21:57:15] <ti1> strangest thing
[21:57:49] <Cork> ti1: i'm not sure you can call getTextNodes from the same statement that defines the variable
[21:58:02] <mattalexx> Is there a version of wrapAll that will only wrap consecutive elements? So this "<p>foo</p><p>foo</p><h2>bar</h2><p>foo</p>" turns into this: "<div><p>foo</p><p>foo</p></div><h2>bar</h2><div><p>foo</p></div>" when this is run: "$('p').wrapAll2('<div />')"
[21:58:10] <Cork> ti1: somehting in the back of my head says "NO" :)
[21:58:27] <ti1> tried separating them and declaring globally, and that didn't help
[21:58:34] <Cork> ti1: i htink you need to define the variable before you create the function, or use function getTextNodes()
[21:59:07] <Cork> ti1: secondly, are you sure jquery is ok with handling textnodes with out normal elements?
[21:59:13] <Cork> never tried that my self
[21:59:36] <Cork> your basically asking jquery to handle just text
[21:59:36] <coldhead> i am very dubious that that would work
[22:00:14] <ti1> jquery will handle text nodes fine
[22:00:43] <Cork> oh WAIT LOL
[22:00:51] <Cork> you did the same error i did the first time i used add
[22:00:56] <Cork> add doesn't modify resuts
[22:01:06] <Cork> it returns the mobified variable
[22:01:17] <Cork> so you need result = result.add(elem);
[22:01:30] <ti1> no shit!
[22:01:36] <ti1> seriously?
[22:01:38] <ti1> goddamn it
[22:01:39] <ti1> haha
[22:01:40] <Cork> ya
[22:02:18] <ti1> wow
[22:02:25] <ti1> thanks very much for your help
[22:02:30] <Cork> np :)
[22:02:32] <ti1> i really appreciate it
[22:02:41] <ti1> what a stupid mistake
[22:03:35] <ti1> take care, thanks again!
[22:03:44] <coldhead> ChrisPartridge: see above, apparently add() is non-destructive
[22:03:50] <coldhead> thanks Cork
[22:04:01] <Cork> ?
[22:04:04] <Cork> ok :)
[22:04:56] <coldhead> i was unaware of that, Cork
[22:05:14] <Cork> ya it suprised me too the at first
[22:05:22] <Cork> i think .add might be the wrong name
[22:05:35] <Cork> should prob be .join or something instead
[22:05:53] <Cork> s/the at/at/
[22:24:15] <brettgoulder> how would I add a hover event to the entire bottom quarter of the window?
[22:24:46] <brettgoulder> I'm confused what I would even bind an event to
[22:24:51] <Cork> brettgoulder: two optons
[22:25:04] <Cork> either add a lear element at the bottom of the screen
[22:25:19] <Cork> or you would have to do it though pure javascript and mousemove on the window object
[22:25:39] <brettgoulder> lear element?
[22:25:46] <Cork> *clear
[22:25:54] <brettgoulder> sorry yup
[22:26:15] <Cork> so it depends on if you have something you have to be able to click on at the bottom
[22:26:19] <Eviltwin> The best solution is probably to use mousemove and the window height
[22:26:42] <brettgoulder> cool ok
[22:26:48] <Cork> event.clientY > window.height - 50
[22:26:50] <Eviltwin> Here's something similar I coded for someone a while back: http://jsfiddle.net/egZHj/
[22:26:50] <Cork> for example
[22:27:21] <Eviltwin> That's right, I save my jsFiddles
[22:27:28] <brettgoulder> ok cool that makes sense
[22:27:32] <brettgoulder> thanks guys
[22:29:11] <coldhead> lol Eviltwin
[22:30:25] <Cork> btw anyone know if jsfiddle's expires?
[22:38:24] <coldhead> i don't believe they do, Cork
[22:38:48] <hyperjxz> somebody tried to kill Obama lololol at least someone tries
[22:40:16] <coldhead> they say it's easier to assasinate the president than it is to achieve enlightenment
[22:40:19] <coldhead> bloody buddhists
[22:41:16] <hyperjxz> :DD
[22:41:45] <hyperjxz> is there a certain way you can achieve enlightment?
[22:42:47] <hyperjxz> i mean one may say one thing others can say different, but for the president it just takes a few shots
[22:43:57] <coldhead> i guess the thing is shooting someone is changing someone else, which is easier than changing yourself
[22:44:25] <coldhead> i don't think they have hard evidence for this, i think it's just a saying
[22:44:31] <coldhead> like "never shave a duck"
[22:46:21] <hyperjxz> probably you are right, he probably never shot any shots at all.. but i feel sorry for him, the FB are probably raping him and will send to mars as a test subject...
[22:48:00] <hyperjxz> anyway.. back to jquery...
[22:53:53] <amirite> what's the best way to implement fixed positioning on mobile browsers
[22:54:18] <amirite> iScroll's implementation feels more native than jquery mobiles, but i don't know if the trade off is in hackishness
[22:56:49] <heshanh> in jqui datepicker, is there a way to jump between years ?
[23:01:31] <ls3_> I need to know when a text box changes.. i bound keyup and change to a function but I'm wondering what I can use to get an event to fire when the user selected something from the history of inputs for that field from their browser
[23:02:21] <coldhead> that MIGHT trigger a click, ls3_
[23:02:49] <ls3_> i can't get it to :)
[23:04:27] <GoSox> anyone using the jquery watermark plugin? It's docs say use a "\n" character to make a new line in a textarea's watermark. But it's not working for me. I'm still getting all of the text in one line
[23:04:33] <GoSox> as seen here: http://www.whatsmyip.org/shorturls/
[23:04:36] <ls3_> i guess i can tie an event to the submit button or hack it another way
[23:05:18] <ls3_> thanks
[23:15:53] <larsemil> http://jsfiddle.net/LDdE7/ <-- i need to use ajax instead of load. but this does not work. any hints on why?
[23:19:19] <ryrych> hi
[23:20:38] <ryrych> is is possible to transform jQuery UI widget to jQuery mobile easily?
[23:21:16] <ryrych> or it would be better to write/re-write it to adapt to jQuery m?
[23:23:22] <petteyg> I'm looking for a tooltip plugin that doesn't abuse the title attribute.
[23:25:11] <coldhead> strong words, petteyg
[23:25:24] <GoSox> NO, THESE ARE STRONG WORDS
[23:25:39] <coldhead> i use tipTip which leans on title, and quite rightly for my needs
[23:25:52] <coldhead> but you can provide your own content and it will leave title alone
[23:26:08] <coldhead> or you could easily hack it to use an attribute of your choice
[23:26:10] <petteyg> coldhead: That's what I need. I need the title attribute available for accessibility.
[23:26:20] <coldhead> <strong>NO U, GoSox</strong>
[23:26:37] <GoSox> too bad you can't just style "natural" tool tips with CSS, with a special property for timing
[23:26:39] <GoSox> that would be spiffy
[23:26:55] <coldhead> $('thing').tipTip({content: "This is not for blind people"})
[23:27:01] <coldhead> i think that's how it works
[23:33:36] <larsemil> http://jsfiddle.net/LDdE7/ <- no thoughts on this one?
[23:36:02] <coldhead> larsemil: your comment that it "doesn't work" is not especially illuminating
[23:36:51] <coldhead> data might be bogus or the page might be returning an error code
[23:36:59] <larsemil> coldhead: well nothing is happening, i get no response.
[23:37:09] <larsemil> coldhead: on the other hand i get from the load statement
[23:37:28] <coldhead> what happens if you watch the page with firebug/web inspector open?
[23:37:32] <larsemil> nothing
[23:37:43] <larsemil> i get no error msg
[23:37:43] <coldhead> it doesn't even fire the request?
[23:38:13] <larsemil> yes it does
[23:38:33] <coldhead> well that's promising
[23:38:54] <coldhead> and what's it returing, according to your debugger?
[23:38:56] <coldhead> an html page?
[23:39:03] <coldhead> with a 200 OK header?
[23:39:56] <coldhead> try adding dataType: 'html' to your ajax params, in case it's having trouble figuring out what you're returning
[23:40:03] <larsemil> 200 OK 342ms
[23:40:23] <larsemil> coldhead: it should be json
[23:40:38] <coldhead> ah, well dataType: 'json' then
[23:40:52] <larsemil> no difference
[23:41:09] <larsemil> i get 200 OK, but the success function is not being run
[23:41:26] <coldhead> then i would try providing an error callback and seeing what if that fires
[23:41:33] <coldhead> what values it gets
[23:41:46] <coldhead> you should get error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[23:42:01] <coldhead> and you can log the last 2 and see if they're anything helpful
[23:42:33] <coldhead> Iszak will know
[23:45:07] <larsemil> coldhead: syntaxerror: unexpected token
[23:45:14] <coldhead> aha
[23:45:19] <coldhead> so maybe your json is busted?
[23:45:22] <coldhead> try jsonlint.com
[23:46:44] <GoSox> what does a double !! mean in js?
[23:47:11] <coldhead> ?eval !! 27
[23:47:12] <bot-t> coldhead: true
[23:47:18] <coldhead> eval !! 0
[23:47:24] <coldhead> zuh
[23:47:30] <coldhead> ?eval !! 0
[23:47:31] <bot-t> coldhead: false
[23:47:34] <GoSox> ?
[23:47:40] <coldhead> it converts to a boolean
[23:47:44] <GoSox> oh
[23:47:48] <coldhead> ?eval !! ""
[23:47:49] <bot-t> coldhead: false
[23:47:54] <coldhead> ?eval !! "a thing"
[23:47:54] <bot-t> coldhead: true
[23:48:06] <coldhead> the other fun one is this:
[23:48:14] <coldhead> ?eval ~~ "27.12345"
[23:48:17] <bot-t> coldhead: 27
[23:48:20] <GoSox> so it takes the place of "(bool)[value]" in other languages
[23:48:30] <asdf`> GoSox, ! is the logical 'not'. So !! is 'not not'. It's using the conversion to bool provided by !.
[23:48:55] <Cork> anyone know if theres a bug about missing class attributes and jquery 1.6 breaking jquery-ui toggleClass?
[23:48:57] <coldhead> its a way to impress/bewilder newbs and make your code shorter and less readable
[23:49:50] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ZmxvS/ (change to 1.5.2 to see the problem go away)
[23:52:09] <coldhead> ugh, first i've heard of it Cork
[23:52:12] <coldhead> ask ajpiano?
[23:52:25] <coldhead> any joy, larsemil?
[23:52:33] <Cork> i did a big upgrade of a gigantic webapp i have
[23:52:42] <Cork> and saw one of the animations become wierd
[23:52:45] <larsemil> coldhead: you mean the response from the php is busted?
[23:55:09] <coldhead> yes larsemil
[23:55:26] <coldhead> paste the json your php is generating into jsonlint.com and fix whatever it complains about
[23:55:34] <coldhead> because if its busted jquery can't make no sense of it
[23:55:45] <coldhead> whence the syntax error
