[00:01:37] <diverdude> Cork: which will be executed first then?
[00:02:00] <diverdude> Cork: will the function be available in the ready callbacks then
[00:02:13] <Eviltwin> Yes
[00:20:21] <Lucaszz> hi
[00:20:44] <Lucaszz> i looking for best practices for make static class in javascript
[00:29:07] <cods> with JQuery 1.7, should the following works: $("table.somewhere > tbody").on("click", "> tr", ...); ? The "> tr" part doesn't seem to work, the even is not catched (but that's ok with just "tr", but I wanted to use a more precise selector)
[00:37:40] <gianiaz> hi, I'm using the hotkeys jquery plugin, I have a lot of combination to assign, then I wrote this code, http://jsbin.com/ojakem/1/ but it's wrong cause it gets only the last keyword combination. How I have to change my code? Thank you
[00:40:35] <not_mike> how would you all rate unheap's plugins?
[00:48:45] <Elrinth2> anyone by chance have a regexp which targets html attributes which are missing qoutes? I'd like to add qoutes for them
[00:49:35] <Elrinth2> outerHTML() seems to print the html attributes without qoutes
[00:51:08] <madprops> I don't get it, I get true on if($(this).html().indexOf('+ ') !== '-1') even when $(this).html() clearly doesn't have '+ '
[00:52:00] <madprops> i mean the other way around
[00:52:14] <Elrinth2> don't have '-1'
[00:52:21] <Elrinth2> and don't have ==
[00:52:52] <madprops> omg what am I doing lol
[00:53:03] <madprops> I should go to sleep
[00:53:23] <gianiaz> I retry :-) , I'm using the hotkeys jquery plugin, I have a lot of combination to assign, then I wrote this code, http://jsbin.com/ojakem/1/ but it's wrong cause it gets only the last keyword combination. How I have to change my code? Thank you
[00:53:32] <Elrinth2> it should be if($(this).html().indexOf('+ ') != -1) { /* yes we HAVE a '+ ' in the code */ }
[00:54:17] <xec_> !== is perfectly fine
[00:54:22] <xec_> but it's not a string
[00:57:29] <Elrinth2> anyone got a way to fix a string which contains html elements that have attributes which are missing qoutes ?
[00:58:03] <Cork> Elrinth2: the dom should fix that by it self
[00:58:22] <Elrinth2> I think I just had a bright idea
[00:58:27] <Cork> as unquoted attribute values is valid html
[00:58:33] <Elrinth2> since outerHTML is creating broken html
[00:58:47] <Cork> no it's not broken
[00:58:50] <Cork> it's valid
[00:59:03] <Elrinth2> then why is it missing attribute qoutes and ending / for img tags?
[00:59:11] <Cork> cause it's valid
[00:59:14] <Elrinth2> IE8 disagrees that it is valid
[00:59:19] <Elrinth2> and breaks the whole page
[01:00:06] <xec_> gianiaz: edited it, try this http://jsbin.com/uhemed/1/edit
[01:01:16] <Cork> Elrinth2: http://tinyurl.com/k7dd9nb
[01:01:17] <gianiaz> xec_ thank you very much! it works
[01:01:27] <Cork> ops
[01:02:17] <xec_> gianiaz: note that it won't work in ie8- without a shim https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[01:02:47] <Cork> fine lets do it this way then...
[01:02:55] <gianiaz> xec_ argh...
[01:03:42] <Cork> Elrinth2: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fjsbin.com%2Fowezok%2F1&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[01:04:00] <Elrinth2> It does not matter what your validators say, IE8 says it's broken, so it's broken
[01:04:00] <Cork> as you see there, it is perfectly valid html
[01:04:13] <Elrinth2> I have the bug in IE8 and need to fix that
[01:04:16] <xec_> gianiaz: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide55
[01:04:23] <Cork> Elrinth2: ie is, ya, and it's not exactly new
[01:04:52] <Cork> Elrinth2: you would have to run the html through a tidy rutine
[01:05:04] <Elrinth2> in javascript?
[01:05:06] <Cork> ?g javascript html tidy
[01:05:07] <bot-t> Cork, jquery - HTML formatter/tidy/beautifier for JavaScript - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3913355/html-formatter-tidy-beautifier-for-javascript
[01:05:16] <Cork> ?g javascript html tidy lib
[01:05:17] <bot-t> Cork, jquery - HTML formatter/tidy/beautifier for JavaScript - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3913355/html-formatter-tidy-beautifier-for-javascript
[01:05:18] <Elrinth2> I already have an idea... It's outerHTML which generates brken html
[01:05:29] <Elrinth2> just add a div and place element inside div, then use html instead
[01:05:35] <Cork> Elrinth2: ie returns the html it gets from the source
[01:05:37] <Elrinth2> I'm pretty sure the html will be correct then
[01:05:59] <Cork> and apparently it doesn't do html parsing (but xml parsing) on it when it gets it back
[01:06:26] <Cork> Elrinth2: as long as nothing inside the div has attributes
[01:06:32] <Cork> cause then you would get the same problem again
[01:07:11] <Cork> Elrinth2: as a side note, just cause i say it is valid i don't mean its a good idea
[01:07:18] <Cork> i think it's a really bad idea
[01:07:35] <Cork> but it is still valid, so saying it is broken/invalid is not correct
[01:07:36] <gianiaz> xec_, thank you for the link. I switched to jquery.each http://jsbin.com/uhemed/3/edit
[01:08:10] <Elrinth2> Cork I'm sorry but writing attributes in html without qoutes is bad
[01:08:14] <xec_> gianiaz: yep that works too :)
[01:08:24] <Cork> Elrinth2: sure, never said it wasn't
[01:08:39] <Cork> Elrinth2: but the spec, and how browsers NEED to handle it says it is allowed
[01:08:48] <Cork> Elrinth2: if the browser doesn't THEY are doing it wrong
[01:08:54] <Elrinth2> IE8 is a browser, and it doesn't handle it
[01:09:09] <xec_> ie8 handles unquoted attributes just fine
[01:09:10] <Cork> though all best practices in the world will push for you to use quotes
[01:09:13] <Pavlov> how can i set defaultHomeScroll to 0 with jquery mobile?  i'm trying to set it in my mobileinit function, but doesn't seem to stay set
[01:09:16] <xec_> what's the actual issue?
[01:10:19] <Cork> xec: ya, was quite sure it would be, but i haven't used unquoted attribute values in over 20 years so... :)
[01:10:43] <Cork> wait no 20 is too much
[01:10:54] <Cork> 15 is more correct
[01:11:20] <xec_> using quotes is definitely good practice, but as long as there are no spaces (or > etc) in the value, it should be fine
[01:11:29] <Cork> ya
[01:12:03] <Cork> it looks horrible, but it is valid; and it should work
[01:12:06] <xec_> and html generated by innerHTML / outerHTML will differ between browsers quote-wise
[01:12:44] <woozly> how to get loaded data and manipulate with it? :/ http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-response
[01:12:48] <Cork> one difference i remember (and often gets annoyed by) is that ie always generates upper case tag names
[01:12:55] <xec_> yeah that too
[01:12:56] <Cork> (for generated dom elements at least)
[01:13:02] <woozly> I want to highlight inputted text with bold in suggests list :(
[01:13:39] <Cork> woozly: check the demo page, they have an example there
[01:13:46] <woozly> oh
[01:13:48] <Cork> (how you style the display)
[01:14:11] <Cork> its some data('autocomplete')._something magic
[01:14:18] <Cork> don't remember it of the top of my head
[01:14:20] <woozly> okay. Thank you Cork!
[01:14:38] <xec_> i think ._somethingMagic sounds about right
[01:14:44] <Cork> :D
[01:15:04] <Cork> .data( "ui-autocomplete" )._renderItem = function( ul, item ) {
[01:16:21] <woozly> I <3 U
[01:16:24] <woozly> :D
[01:19:28] <sikor_sxe> hello. is there a way to tell whether a click event is outside of a certain div?
[01:20:01] <lenswipee> sikor_sxe: i believe so.
[01:20:03] <Cork> $(document).on('click', function(event) { if(event.target !== target_element });
[01:20:29] <Cork> actually you need to do a bit more then that
[01:20:46] <Cork> to catch the children of the target element
[01:20:51] <sikor_sxe> Cork: well the target may be nested within that div
[01:20:54] <sikor_sxe> yeah
[01:21:21] <xec_> $(document).on("click", ":not(.myDiv)" ... ?
[01:21:28] <xec_> would that work?
[01:22:35] <fraxture> anyone know how i could ensure that any scroll event on any element on a screen impacts a particular element?
[01:23:41] <xec_> nope
[01:23:46] <Cork> fraxture: scroll doesn't bubble if i remember correctly
[01:23:51] <xec_> sorry, that nope wasnt for you fraxture
[01:23:59] <xec_> it was for me :P
[01:24:00] <Cork> so ya, you would have to bind scroll on every element that has overflow
[01:24:38] <fraxture> i'm not sure if i've described what i mean well. the effect i'm trying to recreate is here: http://www.designweekportland.com/2012#_event-86
[01:25:13] <fraxture> scrolling anywhere on the page only effects the event list... until a certain point has been reached.
[01:25:21] <fraxture> i.e. when the list is at the bottom i think
[01:25:34] <xec_> sikor_sxe: you could do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/g4gCY/
[01:27:13] <Cork> xec: that would be the simplest way, but you can do it without stopPropagation
[01:27:57] <Cork> $(target_element).find('*).andSelf().index(target_element) != -1 should work
[01:28:05] <Cork> uh...
[01:28:13] <Cork> $(event.target).find('*').andSelf().index(target_element) != -1 should work
[01:29:13] <fraxture> xec_, was that for me?
[01:29:19] <Cork> stopPropagation can be nasty if you later write something that depends on it propagating
[01:29:29] <xec_> fraxture: nop
[01:29:54] <fat> how do i change the width of this whole box? link: http://lolplanet.net/test/ css: http://pastebin.com/KsuqgsVM
[01:31:05] <sikor_sxe> Cork: thanks! that works :)
[01:31:36] <Cork> sikor_sxe: did you use the stopPropagation or the andSelf thingy?
[01:32:10] <sikor_sxe> andSelf
[01:32:31] <sikor_sxe> i'd prefer not to mess with the events
[01:32:42] <fat> hellp
[01:33:55] <sikor_sxe> Cork: hmm, however this does not work when i click on textareas or inputs :/
[01:34:12] <Cork> sikor_sxe: what do you mean?
[01:34:17] <angelazou> quick question, how do I find an element that is in display: block given a class name?
[01:34:31] <angelazou> there is a collection of divs using the same class name, but they are display: none
[01:34:36] <Cork> angelazou: :visible; but you really should be using a second class
[01:34:44] <Cork> ?:visible
[01:34:45] <bot-t> :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[01:35:47] <angelazou> got it, thanks
[01:36:23] <fat> my turn!
[01:36:25] <sikor_sxe> Cork: not sure why, but the expression is evaluated as true when clicking on inputs/textareas *and* the special div
[01:39:44] <roelmonnens> Hello, We are receiving requests where that POST and GET is empty from IE9. (One problem, the post shouldn't be empty). It's only IE9 that sometimes sends those requests. Does anybody have the same problem?
[01:41:21] <xec_> fat: you are not entitled to free support. (noone is) Saying "hellp" and "my turn" is unlikely to get you the sort of attention you desire.
[01:41:50] <xec_> fat: that said, changing the width of something is usually a job for CSS - what is stopping you from changing the width?
[01:42:15] <Cork> roelmonnens: you would have to track what is happening client side
[01:42:17] <fat> xec_: the objects keep moving out of position when i change it
[01:42:31] <Cork> roelmonnens: and no that isn't a common problem as far as i know
[01:43:06] <roelmonnens> We have lot's of requests and only about 5% are requests with empty POST values
[01:43:09] <xec_> fat: could you post a demo at jsfiddle.net instead, so it's possible to play around with the code? and show what happens after you've tried to change the width?
[01:43:14] <roelmonnens> and all of them are from IE9
[01:43:44] <roelmonnens> I don't think the problem is laying at the clientside since Chrome/Firefox/Opera never have these problems
[01:43:49] <Cork> roelmonnens: you would have to try to track it down
[01:43:51] <roelmonnens> IE10 is to small to detect
[01:44:00] <Cork> wow
[01:44:15] <roelmonnens> Yes, but It's really hard to detect random errors of IE9
[01:44:16] <Cork> ie10 is twice the number of visitors to ie9 here
[01:44:16] <roelmonnens> :D
[01:44:38] <Cork> i'm fully aware
[01:44:50] <Cork> the problem is it can't be answered generically
[01:45:10] <roelmonnens> yes I know, but I was hoping that somebody else had that problem :D
[01:45:20] <roelmonnens> but then I will search further
[01:45:25] <roelmonnens> thnx 4 trying to help!
[01:45:27] <fat> xec_: i can't, there are php files associated with it
[01:46:23] <xec_> fat: of course you can, just copy the generated html from view source in browser
[01:48:49] <fat> xec_: http://jsfiddle.net/XkN7k/1/
[01:50:52] <xec_> fat: http://jsfiddle.net/XkN7k/2/
[01:51:06] <xec_> now you just need to change the script as well
[01:51:24] <fat> xec_: the width is still the same
[01:51:37] <fat> xec_: and i want it smaller too
[01:51:46] <xec_> i set it to a percentage, set what you want
[01:51:47] <fat> xec_: maybe around 700px;
[01:51:50] <fat> oh
[01:51:52] <fat> let me try
[01:52:10] <fraxture> ok asked before about this, but maybe i will try to ask the question differently: is there a way to force a scroll event on a document body to always only affect a specific element which has overflow: auto?
[01:52:10] <xec_> look for the "width" property in the css ... :P
[01:53:37] <fat> xec_: is this it? div.workplace.expanded { 	width:80%; /*916*/
[01:54:30] <xec_> fat: that is part of it, yes
[01:54:42] <xec_> fat: that's the bigger, expanded part
[01:55:05] <xec_> fat: i also removed width from #main and added a percentage to .workplace.collapsed
[01:58:44] <fat> xec: but if you click on the buttons on the left or right, the size changes back to normal
[01:59:15] <platinoid> So I a
[01:59:56] <platinoid> So I am having a relatively simple problem here, learnt my first jquery code yesterday
[02:00:19] <platinoid> what I am trying to do is load dropdown menu's dynamically through jquery
[02:00:37] <platinoid> I will proceed by breaking down my prblem and posting code
[02:01:59] <xec_> fat: yes. you need to edit the script as well
[02:02:07] <fat> ooh
[02:02:25] <fat> ook
[02:02:49] <fat> will work on it now thank you so much
[02:03:36] <platinoid> This is my script http://pastebin.com/WcJB7xZ3 and this is how I am trying to output the options dynamically got from the database http://pastebin.com/2q51JEBK
[02:04:04] <fat> thnak u i got it working
[02:04:27] <platinoid> Problem is that this works only for one iteration. Just one Select<option> works dynamically out of the 10 I have there
[02:04:39] <platinoid> So please, if someone can help me with it
[02:04:51] <platinoid> I'd be really greatful
[02:06:45] <paulvd> hello, i am trying to set the width of a div equal to the width (dynamic) of another width, i am using this jQuery("#menu").css({'width':(jQuery("#menu ul").width()+'px')}); but it doesn't work (its wordpress so using the jquery conflict function)
[02:07:41] <Cork> jQuery("#menu").width(jQuery("#menu ul").width())
[02:08:19] <Cork> also ul normally has display: block
[02:08:37] <Cork> so are you sure it actually isn't width: 100%; ?
[02:08:38] <platinoid> Alright long story cut short. How can I ensure that the .load works on all the iterations
[02:08:50] <platinoid> Someone?
[02:09:07] <Cork> .load works on what?
[02:09:25] <Cork> and do you mean the event handler or the load command?
[02:09:46] <woozly> dammit, how to change hover css for autocomplete? I want to change this grayed background on item. But if I try to ui-state-active/hover - it doesn't change ((
[02:10:16] <Cork> i think it has ui-state-hover
[02:10:49] <platinoid_> Cork: This is the line  calling getdata $("#tasks").load("getdata.php?choice=" + $("#projects").val()); This out puts the <options> dynamically from the db
[02:11:00] <Cork> woozly: nope its ui-state-focus
[02:11:08] <woozly> ohh..
[02:11:11] <woozly> dammit!!!!
[02:11:15] <woozly> Cork thank you again man!
[02:12:07] <Cork> platinoid_: ok? (i get even less of the question now...)
[02:12:07] <platinoid_> #tasks - > options id
[02:12:12] <platinoid_> #projects -> Select id
[02:12:33] <platinoid_> ok here goes
[02:13:34] <Cork> platinoid_: so you send a request to the server and you get html back
[02:13:52] <platinoid_> I am trying to display a dropdown dynamically by calling a jquery function that on change calls another file with the get parameters. This file is getdata where I am pulling stuff from the database and echoing it in an <option> form
[02:13:55] <Cork> the html replaces the option tags in the select to the select element
[02:14:22] <Cork> and when that happens you want to...?
[02:14:26] <AAlien> hum. if i scale an element with css, how can i get its actual width on screen instead of "html width"?
[02:14:54] <Cork> AAlien: that is it's actual size
[02:15:28] <Cork> AAlien: there isn't a difference between display size and "html size"
[02:15:47] <AAlien> well what am i doing wrong then, because $(element).width always returns the same number
[02:16:13] <platinoid_> Cork: just 2 code snippets, please have a look, this is the code echoing the div that I have looped --> http://pastebin.com/2q51JEBK
[02:16:22] <Cork> AAlien: how are you scaling it?
[02:16:58] <AAlien> Cork: style="transform: matrix(scaleX, ..., scaleY, ...)"
[02:17:12] <Cork> platinoid_: wait, you add a table inside a select element?!?
[02:17:22] <Cork> well table cell rather
[02:17:26] <Cork> AAlien: ah
[02:17:42] <Cork> AAlien: i don't think you can get the result of that factor actually
[02:17:55] <platinoid_> and this is the javascript --> http://pastebin.com/xqTbH1EF
[02:17:59] <Cork> as the element actually has the same size when you do that
[02:18:29] <Cork> platinoid_: your adding a td inside a select element
[02:18:35] <Cork> that won't work
[02:19:33] <AAlien> Cork: box model in firefox's inspector mode does show the real size
[02:19:48] <platinoid_> Cork: Uh no. My bad, I am not. The select gets over before this call http://pastebin.com/2q51JEBK
[02:20:18] <Cork> huh??
[02:20:19] <AAlien> and by "real" i mean the size i would assume is should show :)
[02:20:22] <platinoid_> question - > How can I make jquery work for all selects and not just the first one :|
[02:20:48] <AAlien> like if i start with a div with width 1000 and scale it up by 3.2, box model says its width is now 3200 px
[02:22:19] <platinoid_> pika pika
[02:22:30] <platinoid_> :|
[02:23:19] <Cork> AAlien: http://jsfiddle.net/gv9XW/
[02:23:30] <Cork> all i get here is the dom size 150x150
[02:23:58] <Cork> if it would have taken the scale into account it would have been ~50
[02:24:15] <platinoid_> Cork: bro?
[02:24:28] <platinoid_> no go?
[02:24:46] <Cork> platinoid_: i've keeped asking, and i can't make head or tail of your question sorry
[02:24:54] <Cork> so no clue
[02:25:42] <AAlien> Cork: http://imgur.com/hdqld2d 45 px :P
[02:26:02] <platinoid_> nice
[02:26:08] <sacho> platinoid_, please state your problem clearly and concisely, with code examples
[02:26:10] <platinoid_> Im on my own then
[02:26:40] <Cork> AAlien: ah, so the built in box model view takes scaling into account
[02:27:00] <Cork> AAlien: well js and dom don't know those values
[02:27:17] <Cork> and firebug actually shows just that
[02:27:25] <sacho> AAlien, test case please
[02:28:08] <Cork> AAlien: and actually same does chrome http://jsfiddle.net/gv9XW/2/
[02:28:39] <Cork> so i wonder if it's actually the built in inspector in firefox that bugs
[02:28:44] <Cork> seams like it
[02:29:03] <inad922> Hi
[02:29:18] <AAlien> blah, i guess i'll just save the scale somewhere and calculate the scaled width
[02:29:19] <inad922> If I have a select input how can I change which option is selected?
[02:29:46] <Cork> $('select').val('new select value')
[02:29:55] <inad922> Cork: thx
[02:29:58] <platinoid_> sacho:Once again, there is a <select id="projects"> from which when a value is selected the jquery function is called like this <script>$("#projects").change(function()</script>
[02:29:59] <Cork> np
[02:31:07] <platinoid_> there is another select field with id ="tasks" that needs to be changed according to the value selected in the previous select that is done by $("#tasks").load("getdata.php?choice=" + $("#projects").val());
[02:33:00] <platinoid_> Now the getdata.php you see here gets values from the database and echoes them in the form <options>dynamic value</options> which is supposed to be loaded by the "tasks" dropdown
[02:34:22] <platinoid_>  sacho:Once again, there is a <select id="projects"> from which when a value is selected the jquery function is called like this <script>$("#projects").change(function()</script>           then  there is another select field with id ="tasks" that needs to be changed according to the value selected in the previous select that is done by $("#tasks").load("getdata.php?choice=" + $("#projects").val());

[02:34:53] <sacho> why are you repeating the same thing?
[02:36:01] <platinoid_> problem occurs when I enclose the <select id="tasks"> in a loop to display the result many times, in short multiple similar dropdowns. Then it just works for the first iteration
[02:36:18] <platinoid_> and the rest don't load by the jquery
[02:36:27] <platinoid_> Sacho:Thats my problem
[02:36:32] <Cork> platinoid_: your html is broken
[02:36:59] <Cork> you return td>select>options and adds then inside an existing <select>
[02:37:15] <Cork> also you have multiple elements with the same id
[02:37:21] <platinoid_> Cork: Which part exactly?
[02:37:25] <Cork> you REALLY need to clean up your html
[02:37:36] <Cork> most all of the pb's you've sent me actually
[02:38:11] <sacho> You should also read about how jquery works - specifically, the selection engine.
[02:38:16] <Cork> <select id="tasts">  $('#tasks').load('') > <td><select id="tasks">...</select></td>
[02:38:37] <Cork> no wonder things break left right and center
[02:39:19] <Cork> ^that response would give you <select id="tasks"><td><select id="tasks"><options...></select></td></select>
[02:39:42] <Cork> and it 1. has invalid children to a select element and 2. has duplicate id's
[02:41:24] <platinoid_> no bro
[02:41:29] <platinoid_> sorry you did not get it
[02:41:36] <platinoid_> it is working fine
[02:41:42] <Cork> it's kinda hard as you're question doesn't make sense
[02:42:07] <platinoid_> if broken html would have been the case then even one iteration woudnt have worked successfully with jquery
[02:42:09] <platinoid_> which it is
[02:42:44] <Cork> platinoid_: display the needed html, ajax response and javascript
[02:42:53] <Cork> and let us stop guessing
[02:43:14] <platinoid_> please go to 15:03 15:04 15:04 3 posts over there will make it crystal clear what I am trying to achieve and where the problem lies
[02:47:30] <platinoid_> needed html : <select id="projects"><option1><option2 and 3 and so on</select> upon selecting one of the options the jquery gets called coz of this line <script>$("#projects").change(function())</script>
[02:48:14] <platinoid_> the next line that is the function called above is  $("#tasks").load("getdata.php?choice=" + $("#projects").val());
[02:48:51] <platinoid_> so the needed html is actually <select id="tasks"><option1>option2></select>
[02:49:39] <sacho> You could have created a test case by now
[02:58:45] <platinoid> Cork: you still there?
[02:58:57] <platinoid> Were you able to figure it out?
[03:03:32] <Kev-> $('input[type=text]').each(function() {...}) is giving me "normal" elements, not jquery elements... Can I convert it to jquery elements somehow so I can use jquery functions on them? (I need .parent())
[03:03:43] <sacho> platinoid, you need to show a test case with your problem
[03:03:51] <Cork> Kev-: $(this)
[03:03:56] <platinoid> alright Ill do that
[03:04:13] <platinoid> pastebins and printscreens on the way!
[03:04:19] <rmp> hi all.....so IE10 is a nightmare, right? Are there recommandation for transitioning to IE10 when been using jquery1.7.1 and other various libraries such as jquery UI
[03:04:44] <Cork> rmp: uh ie10 nightmare??
[03:04:44] <Kev-> Thanks cork :)
[03:04:47] <sacho> platinoid, or just a jsfiddle
[03:04:59] <Cork> preferably a working jsfiddle ya
[03:05:12] <Cork> so we can actually see what the code you talk about is meant to do
[03:05:39] <Cork> rmp: for me ie10 works quite well
[03:05:53] <Cork> sure i wouldn't like to have it as my normal browser
[03:06:00] <Cork> but i have no grudge against it
[03:06:40] <rmp> Cork: yes my code does not work on IE10 but ok on IE9, debugging is not easy, I suspect IE10 should understand correct javascript constructs.
[03:07:01] <sacho> "doesn't work" is not a javascript error, though
[03:07:03] <Cork> rmp: as far as i know ie10 is more correct then ie9
[03:07:11] <jalon> Hi, i dont know why my script works under jsfiddle but not with the files of my working directory. the only difference is that all of my js is in a separate .js file wich i include in my <head> tag of my html file. the result is that the little circle that follows my mouse inst displayed. here is the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/VXBdb/
[03:07:24] <Cork> ie10 actually runs like most other browser, and you don't need silly exceptions for it
[03:07:31] <Cork> ie9 does
[03:07:58] <Cork> (and not to forget ie8, 7 and *shiver* 6)
[03:09:08] <rmp> I get a lot of these: SCRIPT3: Member not found....and on a compressed library it's painful, will need the dev environment to debug
[03:09:40] <boxmein> rmp: which browser do you use?
[03:09:41] <Cork> rmp: i would guess at the library using ua sniffing
[03:09:45] <Cork> boxmein: ie10
[03:09:56] <boxmein> D:
[03:10:11] <Cork> rmp: and as ie10 actually doens't use the old ie specific dom commands anymore that is most likely why it fails for you
[03:10:16] <boxmein> I know Chrome/Webkit's DevTools can prettify source code by the box
[03:10:37] <boxmein> so one would find out the location with ease
[03:10:57] <boxmein> yet hum
[03:11:00] <boxmein> that's probably it D:
[03:11:12] <boxmein> just a shite library developer
[03:11:17] <platinoid> Cork, sacho: Alright here goes This is the PHP echoing the HTML required http://pastebin.com/7L0zjdYz
[03:11:41] <platinoid> This is the javascript  making things happen http://pastebin.com/fk9SEnHx
[03:11:54] <rmp> Cork: what is replacing the "old" DOM commands?
[03:12:04] <platinoid> and this is the output expected http://imageshack.us/f/607/88370963.jpg/
[03:12:09] <jalon> anybody got a clue ? i guess its pretty basic newbie error since i'm a total beginner
[03:12:24] <Cork> rmp: ie9- attachEvent => addEventListener for one
[03:12:43] <ktwo> Hi, is there a way to do simulate a full page reload (F5) via Ajax ?
[03:12:54] <Cork> ktwo: no
[03:13:06] <Cork> ktwo: from js you can trigger a reload though
[03:13:11] <Cork> window.location.reload()
[03:13:29] <rmp> that's ok, I could deal with that sort of thing...I just dont know where to start with jQuery versions, which is most suited for IE10?
[03:13:52] <ktwo> basically the issue is that i need to force a new JSF lifecycle. maybe it would be enough to update just the whole body via ajax. Is that possible maybe?
[03:13:59] <Cork> rmp: jquery 1.5+ should work quite fine in ie10
[03:14:05] <Cork> actually jquery 1.4 too
[03:14:21] <Cork> ktwo: and if you get the error in jquery just grab the uncompressed jquery lib
[03:14:26] <rmp> ok I'll strip the code to bear minimum and come back later, thanks
[03:14:38] <ktwo> yea full reload is kinda slow though because all images and js have to be requested from server so  wanted to avoid this
[03:14:54] <ktwo> but well if there is no other way to do it ill stick to it, just hoped it would work differenty
[03:15:04] <Cork> ktwo: no the images doesn't have to be requested from server cause of a reload
[03:15:17] <Cork> only if they have nocache or if they have expired
[03:15:21] <sacho> ktwo, well, it seems like your question is more related to JSF
[03:15:47] <ktwo> no no it isnt JSF is only the reason why i need a full refresh at that point :)
[03:15:51] <Cork> (or if the cache has been too active so the image is missing from it)
[03:16:08] <ktwo> yea ok, and what about *.js files?
[03:16:12] <ktwo> are they cached too?
[03:16:16] <Cork> yes
[03:16:28] <Cork> only thing that isn't cached by default is post's
[03:16:33] <Cork> as in post requests
[03:17:15] <Cork> the entire dom will have to be regenerated though, and that can take significant time
[03:17:35] <ktwo> i made an experiment and tried to reload a specific div via ajax which mostly contained the whole page and it was a lot faster than hitting F5
[03:17:49] <ktwo> ah okay
[03:17:56] <Cork> a trick i use sometime to speed reloading a fairly static page up is to grab the body through ajax
[03:18:03] <Cork> and replacing the body in the current document
[03:18:12] <Cork> that way you don't need the full dom construction
[03:18:18] <Cork> and you can shave quite a bit of time
[03:18:41] <Cork> ktwo: ya, that is most likely the dom creation problem
[03:19:09] <ktwo> yea that kinds sounds like what i need to do , since the body is correctly generated by the server anyway i guess
[03:19:21] <sacho> also script execution :)
[03:19:58] <Cork> not to forget script parsing and jitting
[03:24:35] <jalon> why does the $(document).mousemove(function.... works in jsfiddle but not in my included js file on my working directory ? http://jsfiddle.net/VXBdb/
[03:25:05] <Cork> jalon: heh cause you do something differently in your page? :D
[03:25:12] <jalon> does it has something to do with .ready') ?
[03:25:15] <platinoid> Cork:?
[03:25:33] <platinoid> please take some time to go through it
[03:25:37] <Cork> jalon: are you waiting for dom ready in your page?
[03:25:52] * Cork points at the fact that your using onload in jsfiddle
[03:25:54] <innociv> Is there something like preventDefault or stopPropogation that'll stop firefox quicksearch with fucking with my hotkeys?
[03:26:26] <Cork> innociv: i THINK you can define hotkeys that override taht
[03:26:27] <jalon> Cork : no i didnt even think of it. so i need for the DOM to be loaded in order for it to work ?
[03:26:28] <Cork> *that
[03:26:43] <innociv> How, though? I already have uh
[03:26:50] <Cork> jalon: not sure, but it sounds like that would be the cause
[03:27:08] <innociv> Wait maybe I don't
[03:27:20] <sacho> jalon, you need it to be loaded to use rect.
[03:27:42] <sacho> Please when reporting an error give the exact error rather than "working/not working"
[03:28:43] <platinoid> Fucking niggas
[03:29:31] <Kev-> I have an element object... How do I select elements of a certain type within that element?
[03:29:57] <Cork> ?.find @ Kev-
[03:29:58] <bot-t> Kev-, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[03:30:01] <jalon> Cork and sacho : in fact i get Horodatage : 31/05/2013 12:29:02 Erreur : TypeError: document.getElementById(...) is null Source File : <my source file path>
[03:30:07] <Kev-> Thanks :)
[03:30:34] <Cork> jalon: ya, so you try to get an element by id before the element is loaded
[03:31:01] <Cork> jalon: you need to wait for dom ready see ?.ready
[03:31:01] <bot-t> jalon, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[03:31:03] <jalon> Cork and sacho : if i grab it through jQuery it should hadle it fine or should i use .ready() ?
[03:31:15] <jalon> handle*
[03:31:29] * Cork point at the answer he just gave
[03:31:58] <jalon> ok, thanks Cork
[03:36:52] <jalon> Cork : hum doesnt work though http://jsfiddle.net/VXBdb/1/
[03:37:37] <jalon> Cork : wooops, it works !!!
[03:38:35] <Cork> jalon: http://jsfiddle.net/VXBdb/2/
[03:39:25] <Cork> jalon: also you most likely want to have a look at requestAnimationFrame
[03:39:32] <Cork> ?g mdn requestAnimationFrame
[03:39:36] <bot-t> Cork, window.requestAnimationFrame - Web API reference | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.requestAnimationFrame
[03:39:51] <Cork> its a nice replacement for the setInterval
[03:40:17] <sikor_sxe> pardon my noobness, but is there a "this" for functions in js? i currently use var myfunc = function() {...} and do an "unbind('click', myfunc)" within that function. this seems to work
[03:40:41] <Cork> sikor_sxe: there is a "this" variable yes
[03:41:08] <Cork> ?eval var say = function() { print(this); }; say.call('hello');
[03:41:09] <jalon> Cork : i did it a different way http://jsfiddle.net/VXBdb/3/ What do you think of it ?
[03:41:13] <bot-t> Cork: "hello"
[03:41:15] <sikor_sxe> Cork: yes, but it's not referencing the current function
[03:41:31] <Cork> sikor_sxe: it refers to the object set for the function
[03:41:40] <sikor_sxe> yes
[03:41:54] <sacho> sikor_sxe, <ecmabot> If a function is called on an object, object.y(), then `this` within `y` refers to `object`. If called directly: y(), `this` refers to the global object - for browsers it's `window`. `this` can be set explicitly by using y.call(thisArg, argument1, argument2, ...), or with .apply() and .bind(). For further explanation, see: http://killdream.github.com/blog/2011/10/understanding-javascript-oop/#sec-2-2
[03:42:12] <Cork> ?eval var a = { message: "hello"; say: function() { print(this.message); } }; a.say();
[03:42:13] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing } after property list
[03:42:35] <Cork> uh...
[03:42:56] <sacho> message: ;
[03:43:07] <Cork> bah
[03:43:11] <Cork> ?eval var a = { message: "hello", say: function() { print(this.message); } }; a.say();
[03:43:12] <bot-t> Cork: "hello"
[03:43:23] <sikor_sxe> i wondered wether there is some kind of "thisFunction" keyword, i think there was something like this in groovy
[03:43:43] <Cork> sikor_sxe: if you checked i used it in the first example
[03:43:52] <Cork> ?g mdn apply
[03:43:54] <bot-t> Cork, Function.prototype.apply - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[03:43:55] <Cork> ?g mdn call
[03:43:56] <bot-t> Cork, Function.prototype.call - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[03:44:36] <sacho> sikor_sxe, sorry, I misread your problem.
[03:44:41] <sacho> sikor_sxe, name your functions.
[03:45:09] <Cork> what would naming have to do with this?
[03:45:35] <sacho> ?eval var x = function x() { return x;//Or unbind x };
[03:45:36] <bot-t> sacho: SyntaxError: missing } after function body
[03:45:44] <sacho> ?eval var x = function x() { return x;/*Or unbind x*/ };
[03:45:45] <bot-t> sacho: undefined
[03:45:55] <Cork> ah
[03:46:01] <sacho> stupid every bot returning undefined for var statements
[03:46:05] <Cork> there is the old uggly... callee
[03:46:17] <Cork> but it is about to be removed to don't use it
[03:46:32] <Cork> sacho: case var returns nothing
[03:46:35] <sacho> I don't think that's really necessary
[03:46:39] <Cork> it's not the bots fault
[03:46:40] <sikor_sxe> yeah, i use named functions right now. i was just wondering
[03:46:49] <sacho> Cork, expression statements don't return anything either.
[03:46:51] <sacho> yet...
[03:46:53] <sacho> ?eval 5;
[03:46:54] <bot-t> sacho: 5
[03:47:04] <Cork> sacho: sure they do
[03:47:10] <sacho> statements don't "return" anything.
[03:47:22] <Cork> how else do you think you can do var a = expression ?
[03:47:33] <sacho> that's not an expression statement.
[03:47:39] <sikor_sxe> ahhh
[03:47:42] <sikor_sxe> callee it is
[03:47:46] <sikor_sxe> thanks :)
[03:47:52] <sikor_sxe> but it's deprecated it seems
[03:47:57] <sacho> sikor_sxe, you can use named functions in any context you want to use callee.
[03:47:58] <Cork> yes
[03:48:17] <Cork> ya, or just a variable pointing to the anonymous function
[03:48:18] <sacho> sikor_sxe, the name of a function is only part of the function's scope.
[03:48:52] <sacho> sikor_sxe, so you're not in any danger of conflicts.
[03:49:31] <sacho> Anywhere you want to use callee, you can just name your functions.
[03:49:47] <sikor_sxe> alrighty, thanks
[03:54:52] <fatduckling> Can someone please help make the 3 buttons at the top work, corresponding to the slider? http://jsfiddle.net/XkN7k/6/
[04:01:52] <Sepultura> Hallo guys
[04:24:46] <paulvd> can anyone recommend me a good jquery slider plugin (free) which can let you display videos along with custom image and text navigation in the bottom, clicking on which will open videos
[04:39:05] <teza19> Hi, how can i execute this (http://jsfiddle.net/BGSacho/CbcqY/9/) on page load?
[04:45:26] <xec_> teza19: http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/
[04:46:47] <teza19> cool :)
[04:48:01] <paulvd> ok i guess none
[04:49:13] <xec_> paulvd: there are about a thousand plugins that allow for this. but an issue with sling a video is that it will keep playing even if you don't see it
[04:49:22] <xec_> s/sling/sliding
[04:50:40] <paulvd> xec_ thats not my issue here at all...i guess a person who clicks to play it, would want to watch it...
[04:51:09] <paulvd> google is getting worse in searches though, all same image sliders there
[04:51:35] <LEU> hi everyone !
[04:51:41] <xec_> so, what, specifically, is the issue?
[04:51:52] <BlueShark> Hi
[04:52:40] <LEU> I have a problem with my jQueryUI script
[04:54:32] <paulvd> xec_ : a slider where i can put any html in it, with navigation below it (text+image clickable)
[04:54:51] <paulvd> ihave tried couple of them but seems like they work with images only
[04:55:28] <LEU> I made a drag and drop session and I made many divs droppable andy also may divs draggable when I drag a draggable div into a droppable div the droppable div become droppable("disabled") and that's fine but when I drag it out it doesn't become droppable('enabled') what should I do ?!
[04:55:34] <xec_> paulvd: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/non-image.php
[04:55:52] <xec_> paulvd: i haven't tried it personally, but looks promising
[04:56:22] <LEU> xec_ can you help me ?!
[04:56:24] <fabioportieri> LEU: mmm fix it?
[04:56:38] <fabioportieri> nobody can help you without code
[04:56:43] <xec_> LEU: it is considered impolite to call out people by name without good reason
[04:56:50] <xec_> ?demo @ LEU
[04:56:51] <bot-t> LEU, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:59:08] <paulvd> xec_: yeah but no navigation (html, image +text)
[04:59:32] <xec_> paulvd: like this? http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/pager.php
[04:59:50] <xec_> (if not, what do you mean?)
[05:01:15] <paulvd> xec_: those are all linked to images, so won't work in my case
[05:01:52] <xec_> i'm not following. you want navigation as one of the slides?
[05:01:58] <paulvd> no
[05:02:16] <paulvd> i want html in slides, and html in navigation
[05:02:17] <paulvd> both
[05:02:42] <paulvd> not image or just one static link in navigation
[05:02:58] <xec_> did you see the custom template section?
[05:03:20] <xec_> you can basically do what you want
[05:06:35] <paulvd> yeah but the markup is wierd, and no proof that it will accept any html, it seems to be targetting img tags
[05:08:25] <LEU> sorry for that now I have a block of code here http://jsfiddle.net/jKRsZ/1/
[05:09:11] <LEU> after i drop the item in the dropable zone it become disabled
[05:09:34] <xec_> paulvd: both links i gave you are for the same plugin
[05:09:46] <LEU> and when i want to drag the item out it should become droppable enabled
[05:10:21] <LEU> you can try it with the rings
[05:11:18] <LEU> 2 slots 1 ring after you drop the ring in one slot and then in the other you should must switch back the rings
[05:13:32] <hawtin> some help here http://pastebin.com/yT7QTuR5 can someone see where is said that the first comments posted should always remain on top ?
[05:13:57] <paulvd> xec_: i know but if you look at the markup, you will see the difference
[05:14:17] <xec_> paulvd: did you actually try it?
[05:14:37] <hawtin> cause Im using this method to append comments via ajax and its working gr8, only problem is that after you post first comment the rest of them are appended under it in a desc order..
[05:15:05] <hawtin> I need to reverse that and I looked but Im no js expert..can someone point me where/what to change?
[05:15:43] <seutje> hawtin: commentPosition isn't set anywhere?
[05:16:16] <paulvd> xec_: i have tried 4 plugins so far, none of them worked, seems like they all are looking for img tags only, just like this one
[05:16:25] <seutje> also I'm not sure I understand what the point of this is:
[05:16:29] <xec_> paulvd: except this one *isnt*
[05:16:35] <xec_> paulvd: did you see the links
[05:16:52] <xec_> paulvd: the first link i posted is sliding <div>s
[05:16:53] <paulvd> xec_: of course, my reply was based on them only...
[05:16:57] <seutje> if(commentPosition == 'top') {  jQuery('.'+css_commentlist).append(tmpComment); } else if(commentPosition == 'top') {  jQuery('.'+css_commentlist).prepend(tmpComment);    }
[05:17:06] <seutje> they're the same cases...
[05:17:28] <xec_> lol seutje i was about to say the same
[05:17:28] <hawtin> I know I've tried with bottom and top
[05:17:39] <xec_> hawtin: it checks for "top" twice...
[05:17:41] <seutje> they both check if it's equal to "top"
[05:17:49] <seutje> the prepend will never be reached
[05:17:52] <charas> I am using the jquery parallax plugin but osmehow the last two displays look messed up http://www.sushaantu.com/thecitygame.in/beta.html
[05:17:53] <seutje> impossibru
[05:18:07] <hawtin> I know but that was the last thing I've tried, before that was top and bottom
[05:18:19] <LEU> Anybody can help me ?
[05:18:25] <seutje> hawtin: I also don't see where this variable is ever set
[05:18:39] <LEU> I have a block of code here http://jsfiddle.net/jKRsZ/1/
[05:18:45] <hawtin> because Ive removed the variables .. the file was too big :|
[05:18:53] <xec_> -.-
[05:19:18] <xec_> LEU: holy mother of test cases
[05:19:23] <hawtin> http://pastebin.com/cQet42hK complete here
[05:19:40] <paulvd> xec_: true, i noticed that too thats why i told you, that if you look at the pagers, none of them are targetting a div :)
[05:19:42] <xec_> LEU: that's a lot of code - is all this really necessary to illustrate the issue.... also, what IS the issue?
[05:19:57] <paulvd> so i suppose, if this plugin did that, then the author must have given an example...
[05:20:26] <xec_> paulvd: not sure if you're serious or trolling me at this point
[05:20:33] <LEU> the issue is that when i drag out a div from the droppable div it doesn`t become droppable('enabled') again
[05:20:44] <hawtin> so my first comment posted is on top, but after your post another one the first one stays on top and the rest are put in a desc order under it, after you refresh the page they all go back to normal, the latest comment posted - first
[05:21:12] <seutje> hawtin: oh, so it's just a static variable?
[05:22:02] <hawtin> I think so :/ Idk really know whats going on.. Only thing that I now is that I've tried to change diff thing and nothing happened :/
[05:22:13] <paulvd> heh xec_: my question isnt of a troll or is it can show you a working page also..
[05:22:19] <hawtin> I can give you a link to see it live .. :|
[05:22:55] <Lucaszz> with way to send some data from form is better. First each form fields and build an array, then send array to php file. Second submit form with preventing event default
[05:22:56] <Lucaszz> ?
[05:22:58] <hawtin> I mean the problem to see it in action :)
[05:23:28] <seutje> sure
[05:24:15] <BlueShark> Hello, I'm trying to check if a file exists or not, using jquery by using a php proxy to check and analyse the header request. Here's my code: http://codepad.org/zqEggF0n but when the form is submitted, the raw header information is displayed instead of the actual error/success message.
[05:24:20] <BlueShark> Could someone help?
[05:24:20] <xec_> paulvd: okay. my logic is this: the same plugin can do both sliding content and templated navigation. what makes you think it can't do both at the same time? have you tried it?
[05:25:22] <BlueShark> response when the input is "http://php.net" => http://pastie.org/7988566
[05:26:10] <paulvd> xec_: i told you i have played with 4 plugins already, anything slider, flexsldier, two more i dont remember the name, both of some or the other restriction, anything slider is close, but its navigation is in js, and not html
[05:26:51] <xec_> i take that as a "no, i did not try the slider you pointer me at"
[05:26:56] <xec_> pointed*
[05:27:44] <paulvd> i asked for a
[05:27:53] <paulvd> "recommendation" which works, not a guess
[05:28:04] <paulvd> there are thousand sliders out there i know that also
[05:28:42] <xec_> so you did not try it, although there is no reason to believe it won't do what you want it to
[05:28:50] <paulvd> if nothing works, then i will make one of my own
[05:29:13] <xec_> i give up
[05:29:33] <paulvd> xec_: look at the pagers, and tell me what makes you believe that it will target divs instead of img tags
[05:29:55] <xec_> the first link i posted you. im not posting it again.
[05:30:53] <paulvd> none of them have pagers :/
[05:31:24] <xec_> you are getting really close to ending up on my ignore list.
[05:31:54] <LEU> http://jsfiddle.net/jKRsZ/2/ here is my code and I want after I drop a red ring into his pink slot the slot to become droppable disabled and if i drag the ring out it must become dropable enable
[05:32:00] <paulvd> you still didn't answer my question...
[05:32:24] <xec_> multiple times! the second link explains pagers! the first explains sliding content! both links are for the same plugin!
[05:32:44] <xec_> ?cc @ paulvd
[05:32:44] <bot-t> paulvd, CASE CLOASED >: |
[05:33:24] <erlnoob> hello, i'm using jquery ui 1.9.x. is there a way to exclude certain rows in a sortable?
[05:33:54] <paulvd> lol
[05:35:52] <xec_> erlnoob: there is a "cancel" option, seems to do what you want? http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#option-cancel
[05:38:26] <LEU> xec_ I made the code sort sorry for that
[05:38:43] <LEU> here it is http://jsfiddle.net/jKRsZ/3/
[05:39:21] <erlnoob> xec_:  you're right, but is it possible to prevent, say 2 top rows (i'm using tabular data) from being draggable *and* subject to change position due to rows below being dragged on top of them?
[05:40:07] <erlnoob> xec_: the option-cancel only prevents rows from being dragged, but they can still change positions
[05:40:12] <xec_> erlnoob: i would assume the selector is run on every drag, so with a selector that selects the two first elements, it should work.
[05:40:39] <xec_> oh, you want the two top elements to never change position?
[05:40:47] <erlnoob> xec_: yes
[05:41:03] <xec_> if so i'd guess you would need to not make them part of the sortable :)
[05:41:23] <xec_> if it's a table you're talking about, you can have two <tbody>'s
[05:41:39] <erlnoob> xec_: ah, i didn't know that.. thanks
[05:41:41] <xec_> the first with the two top rows and the second sortable
[05:42:37] <xec_> LEU: nice, it's getting maneagable :) what part isn't working, and what part of the code is "not working"?
[05:42:52] <xec_> err.. you know what i mean, i hope
[05:43:31] <FilipNortic> can .trigger be used on hover i.e. .trigger("hover")
[05:43:33] <LEU> the outItem function doesn`t work
[05:44:12] <LEU> when i drag out a dropped item the droppable zone should become droppable again
[05:52:03] <xec_> LEU: yeah it doesn't look like the function is ever triggered http://jsfiddle.net/jKRsZ/4/
[05:54:31] <xec_> wait, it is, if you drag and dont drop it
[05:54:43] <xec_> but not if you drag it out after it's been placed
[05:54:45] <LEU> xec_ the function is trigged when you just drag over the droppable area not when you drop then drag again so drag one item over the droppable area and drag it back without drop then is trigged
[05:55:14] <LEU> oh sorry you already figured it out
[05:55:21] <xec_> say that ten times fast!
[05:56:31] <xec_> yeah, i don't know why it behaves like that, maybe someone with more experience with droppables can help
[05:58:39] <LEU> oh
[05:58:56] <paulvd> heh
[05:59:04] <LEU> that's bad news
[06:01:02] <xec_> FilipNortic: afaik "hover" isn't a js event, so no, you can't trigger it. .hover() is a shorthand for "mouseenter" and "mouseleave" though, which are triggerable
[06:01:14] <xec_> in theory anyway
[06:02:06] <FilipNortic> xec_: yes I went for them instead and it worked
[06:03:47] <LEU> who have droppable experience ?
[06:03:48] <paulvd> can anyone recommend me a good jquery slider plugin (free) which can let you display custom html along with custom html navigation in the bottom
[06:05:30] <paulvd> heh i guess i
[06:05:39] <paulvd> i'll make one myself.
[06:06:01] <LEU> paulvd: can you help me ?
[06:06:50] <xec_> ?glwtd @ paulvd
[06:06:50] <bot-t> paulvd, http://goodluckwiththatdude.com/
[06:07:25] <paulvd> LEu: with what?
[06:07:39] <LEU> with my droppable problem
[06:08:10] <paulvd> LEU: i cant try unless you say what the problem is...
[06:08:17] <LEU> http://jsfiddle.net/jKRsZ/3/
[06:09:02] <LEU> after i drop the item the droppable become disabled and when i drag it out i want to become enabled again
[06:09:28] <paulvd> LEU: sorry busy in some other place so can't see so much codes now..
[06:10:44] <LEU> there is only 3 people active ?
[06:12:36] <chilvers1_> is there a simple way to create an object that inherits a specific object?
[06:13:14] <chilvers1_> at the moment I'm just doing something like; var f = function(){}; f.prototype = base; var item = new f(); ...
[06:20:11] <ravenzz> chilvers1_ var item = Object.create(f.prototype) ?
[06:21:05] <ravenzz> or base
[06:22:38] <chilvers1_> so no simpler way pre-1.8.5 ?
[06:22:58] <chilvers1_> I guess before that I can use a shim for Object.create?
[06:23:07] <ravenzz> yes
[06:23:29] <ravenzz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create#Polyfill
[06:24:23] <chilvers1_> ah, I was wondering how the polyfill handle the propertiesObject, it doesn't :)
[06:26:08] <chilvers1_> then again, it seems Object.create is supported in any browser I care about
[06:27:17] <sacho> chilvers1_, I also don't think most shims can handle Object.create(null)
[06:27:43] <LEU> Is anybody here that have experience with droppable ?
[06:34:59] <eobet> this script works even if height is null, but should I check for null at any point here just to be correct? $(this).find(".text").height($(this).find('img').first().height());

[06:51:50] <rmp> Hi all, where is the best place to log a bug on jquery.validate.js?
[06:55:07] <xec_> rmp: i'm not sure tbh, but google found me this https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/issues
[06:55:43] <xec_> there might be different validation plugins though, make sure it's the right one
[06:56:12] <rmp> xec_: thanks, my issue is with IE10, used to be ok with IE9
[07:01:37] <LEU> xec_: can you recomand me where sould i try to find a answer at my droppable problem ?!
[07:05:24] <c4ptnh00k> does anyone know if $(elem).val() == "" is case sensitive?
[07:06:46] <sacho> yes
[07:06:49] <c4ptnh00k> ty
[07:08:04] <LEU> who can help me with one drag and drop little problem ?
[07:12:31] <Kev-> I'm having some issues with .dialog() where I create a modal and the page scrolls down to display it
[07:13:56] <Kev-> f.e. i click the link that creates the modal at the top of the page... and the page scrolls down 50% where the modal is displayed
[07:14:10] <Kev-> And if I click a modal link on the bottom of the page, it will scroll way lower
[07:16:56] <LEU> who can help me with one drag and drop little problem ?
[07:21:28] <sacho> LEU, don't ask to ask
[07:21:43] <LEU> ok
[07:22:18] <c4ptnh00k> Kev-: page should only scroll to item in focus
[07:22:43] <LEU> http://jsfiddle.net/jKRsZ/3/ the problem is that after I drop a item into the draggable area and I drag it out it doesn't become draggable('enabled')
[07:23:17] <holymacaroons> I'm using jquery mobile with the ajax navigation. I was wondering how I can make the ajax navigation preload a page after I change an anchor. Does jqm do that automatically or do I have to run a specific function?
[07:24:22] <c4ptnh00k> LEU: $(this).droppable( 'disable' ); you disable it here for $(this) so it needs a new even to fire to make it draggable again
[07:24:32] <c4ptnh00k> event
[07:24:57] <LEU> the event is OUT end id doesn't work after i dropped the item
[07:25:22] <LEU> and I made it draggable again in function itemOUT
[07:26:08] <c4ptnh00k> hmmmm
[07:26:26] <c4ptnh00k> everytime i drop it it goes lower and lower
[07:27:24] <LEU> you have to drop red ring into the pink ring
[07:27:38] <LEU> I dont understand what goes lower and lower ?
[07:28:26] <c4ptnh00k> grab the red block and try again and again to put it on the pink ring
[07:28:55] <c4ptnh00k> notice how the red block slides to a lower left area each time
[07:29:23] <yedimind> what
[07:30:03] <yedimind> for a second i thought this was like support for a game of some sorts
[07:30:09] <c4ptnh00k> lol
[07:30:45] <c4ptnh00k> LEU: also you are missing a radix property on lines 7 and 8
[07:30:53] <c4ptnh00k> parameter
[07:31:25] <LEU> it becomes to his position because is revert:"invalid",
[07:32:49] <LEU> line 7 and line 8 is for other part of the script that is missing right now
[07:33:54] <LEU> so grab the red box drop it in the pink box and then drop it in the other pink box and then try to drop it in the first box
[07:34:45] <LEU> that is what I want when the draggable div leave the droppable div the droppable div to become droppable again
[07:37:26] <LEU> c4ptnh00k: did you understood ?
[07:44:09] <BillCriswell> working from home even sucks.
[07:49:39] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: I hate working from home, For some reason people still call...
[08:11:31] <BillCriswell> It's awful quiet in here today.
[08:18:57] <dan2k3k4> $("#myID.mySubClass") should work right?
[08:19:13] <BillCriswell> dan2k3k4: Way overkill, but sure.
[08:19:28] <sacho> dan2k3k4, what do you expect it to do?
[08:19:32] <dan2k3k4> well it's because the slider doesn't have an id for the 'button'
[08:20:02] <BillCriswell> #myID.mySubClass would find <element id="myID" class="mySubClass"/>
[08:20:36] <BillCriswell> If you want the child .mySubClass of #myID you'd want #myID .mySubClass
[08:20:53] <dan2k3k4> ah
[08:21:13] <dan2k3k4> I always wondered why some things didn't have a space
[08:21:24] <dan2k3k4> cheers BillCriswell
[08:21:30] <BillCriswell> dan2k3k4: No problem!
[08:24:31] <LEU> http://jsfiddle.net/jKRsZ/3/ here is my code i made the droppable disabled after you drop your item into and now when i drag out the item i want to make it droppable enabled again
[08:25:32] <bongjovi> Could someone help me with stop().animate()? Not sure why this doesn't stop animating when the mouse leaves the container. http://jsbin.com/isucom/1/edit
[08:25:57] <taskforce> if i have an ordering form which contains checkboxes and quantity field where user can enter the quantity of the order, i want to display what the user selected, how do i do that?
[08:26:31] <celtiore_> hi
[08:26:42] <sacho> bongjovi, what are you trying to achieve there?
[08:27:19] <bongjovi> I basically want the green square to stop fading if the animation isn't complete and the mouse leaves the container.
[08:27:37] <celtiore_> i have strange behavior with jquery
[08:27:42] <sacho> but there's no code that attempts to do that.
[08:28:08] <bongjovi> ah okay, I'm guessing I don't quite understand how stop works.
[08:28:16] <sacho> you'd need to actually call stop() in your mouseout event handler
[08:28:26] <Cork> bongjovi: stop just stops the animation in it's current location
[08:28:26] <BillCriswell> taskforce: You can go like $(':checked').serializeArray(); and go through that.
[08:28:41] <sacho> bongjovi, why are you calling hide() on every mouseover?
[08:29:59] <bongjovi> Cork, so having the stop() i have at the moment makes no difference, I want to call stop on the animation when it mouseouts?
[08:30:24] <Cork> bongjovi: yes
[08:30:43] <bongjovi> okay, I guess I have some more reading to do.
[08:30:44] <bongjovi> Thanks
[08:30:44] <Cork> bongjovi: stop just means it stops the old animation and starts it again if you mouse over again
[08:30:50] <JohnnyCache> anybody knows good & simple tooltip plugin that supports "fixed" tooltip? (with no mouse over element, just show it)
[08:30:57] <muay-guy> hi guys, why is this not changing the correct th's ? http://jsfiddle.net/S7Lbp/5/
[08:30:58] <bongjovi> Ahhh, right.
[08:31:02] <sacho> bongjovi, actually, stop does do something - try spinning your mouse inside the square.
[08:31:04] <Cork> bongjovi: also i think you want mouseenter/mouseleave instead of mousemove/out
[08:31:05] <taskforce> anyone can help me with the form question?
[08:31:33] <BillCriswell> taskforce: I did.
[08:31:51] <bongjovi> Ohhh okay I see what stop() actually does now. Right, that makes a load more sense.
[08:32:03] <Cork> bongjovi: http://jsbin.com/isucom/4/edit
[08:32:42] <taskforce> BillCriswell: i also need to display all other fields inputed
[08:33:35] <BillCriswell> When you say order form are you saying like a tabular? Row 1 Product Name, Qty; Row 2 Product Name, Qty?]
[08:33:52] <Cork> muay-guy: http://jsfiddle.net/S7Lbp/6/
[08:34:01] <Cork> it should be && not ||
[08:34:06] <celtiore_> hi
[08:34:09] <celtiore_> When I inserted the jquery.js file in my code, I have a strange display on the page on my Nexus7, I should have a width of 1024px, but the device appears only 980px, it should be a problem of "conflict "with the viewport, can you help me fix this?
[08:34:09] <bongjovi> Thanks Cork, that makes more sense. What I want is for it to revert to opacity: 1, so I just made a similar function to hide() and ran that on mouseleave
[08:34:20] <taskforce> <BillCriswell> When you say order form are you saying like a tabular? Row 1 Producyes, that and other fields like contact number of the person
[08:34:26] <bongjovi> Cheers, think I can figure out the rest of it now.
[08:34:37] <Cork> muay-guy: != goes with && and == goes with ||
[08:34:45] <Cork> (normally)
[08:34:48] <taskforce> <BillCriswell> yes, that and other fields like contact number of the person
[08:34:54] <LEU> Is there anybody that can help me with my droppable promblem ? http://jsfiddle.net/jKRsZ/3/ I have to make an event that turns droppable back to enabled after you drag out the item
[08:34:57] <muay-guy> Cork: there it still hightlight "Name" though
[08:35:32] <Cork> muay-guy: innertHTML <--
[08:35:58] <muay-guy> Cork: cool, thanks
[08:36:09] <BillCriswell> taskforce: You can do $('form').serializeArray() and check to see if quantity boxes are greater than 0?
[08:38:24] <BillCriswell> taskforce: http://jsbin.com/eloyok/1/edit Take a look at that, open the console and submit the data, you'll see how it gives you the data.
[08:41:32] <taskforce> BillCriswell: don't see anything in the console after submission
[08:41:50] <BillCriswell> You should see [Object, Object, Object]
[08:41:58] <BillCriswell> Assuming you're in Chrome.
[08:42:34] <BillCriswell> Firefox should show something similar.
[08:43:31] <Cork> firefox depends actually; firebug shows the actual data in the objects
[08:43:38] <Cork> but the built in one and chrome shows the same
[08:45:34] <MagmaRules> Hi there
[08:45:37] <BillCriswell> Have to run, later on!
[08:45:57] <MagmaRules> Anyone knows a way i can check if a character I'm about to insert into an input will make a regex invalid ?
[08:45:59] <hxm> i want to validate a string and only allow a-zA-Z0-9 "_" and ".", without accents or european symbols
[08:46:00] <taskforce> i see init jsbin-3.2.35.min.js:18
[08:46:00] <taskforce> [Object, Object, Object]
[08:46:00] <taskforce> 0: Object
[08:46:00] <taskforce> 1: Object
[08:46:00] <taskforce> 2: Object
[08:46:00] <taskforce> length: 3
[08:46:01] <taskforce> __proto__: Array[0]
[08:46:02] <taskforce> in chrome
[08:46:08] <hxm> does jquery that ? i cant get it with js
[08:46:38] <NoiseEee> hxm: uh of course JS does. regex / match
[08:47:05] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions @ hxm
[08:47:22] <hxm> yea and i have this /^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/; and reading about áé it is more complicated than a simple replace
[08:47:55] <hxm> so i wondered if there is a builtin function for these routines
[08:47:58] <NoiseEee> hxm: out of interest, why strip those valid letters?
[08:48:15] <hxm> because it will be a page url alias
[08:49:03] <NoiseEee> hxm: maybe take a peek at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/227950/programatic-accent-reduction-in-javascript-aka-text-normalization-or-unaccentin
[08:49:12] <taskforce> i need to output what user entered
[08:49:15] <wild_oscar> hey. does anyone know how to define an image's size in layerslider?
[08:49:22] <taskforce> the ones selected via the checkbox
[08:49:23] <hxm> yes, the post i saw before
[08:49:27] <taskforce> and other field items
[08:49:38] <NoiseEee> hxm: well no, jquery doesn't provide any particular methods relating to that :)
[08:49:56] <hxm> i go try the last post, surely it will work
[08:49:58] <hxm> thanks

[09:07:37] <clov3r> horacsio, if you remove the <script> tag from the start of your js
[09:07:55] <clov3r> i think it works how you want it to...
[09:08:28] <horacsio> ok let me try clov3r
[09:09:50] <clov3r> http://jsfiddle.net/vM4vF/1/
[09:11:18] <horacsio> clov3r: can you pvt?
[09:11:21] <wiherek> hi
[09:11:26] <clov3r> pvt?
[09:11:37] <wiherek> how can I add a pseudo element like :befor to $(this)?
[09:12:13] <wiherek> i was maybe thinking... $(this + ":after") ? but that doesnt look right
[09:15:13] <wiherek> or maybe otherwise: i have a handful of img elements
[09:15:24] <wiherek> and I need to provide captions
[09:15:50] <wiherek> I now have the caption data in my custom data-desc attribute
[09:16:20] <wiherek> what would be a good way to render them?
[09:20:29] <rbs> hey you. I`m using jquery.maskedinput.min.js and I have a mask rule set as $(".input-mask-cep").mask("99999-999",{placeholder:" ",completed:function(){alert("You typed the following: "+this.val());}}); .... It works awesome, but I would like to have a way to validate it by script, for example, I have a button that does a search when clicked (it is not a submit) but i just can call the search function if the field value is correct 99999-999, is there anyway to va
[09:21:19] <xnotte> i have a ajax request that returns "[{"id_dados":1,"id_anto":3,"id_demo":2}]", how can i treat data var in my $ajax method to access the separated values ? http://jsfiddle.net/e3uFr/

[09:23:06] <xnotte> portuguese
[09:23:24] <rbs> I mean, are you brazilian? :) and I see that yes. Lemme pvt you.

[09:38:27] <JimmyXander>                     console.log('next ' + position);

[09:38:29] <JimmyXander>             });
[09:38:29] <JimmyXander> why does that not work
[09:38:47] <JimmyXander> the console logs -500px correctly
[09:38:56] <JimmyXander> but the css is never applies to .panel
[09:39:05] <jedimind> dont paste code in the channel
[09:39:13] <jedimind> and setup a test case of your problem
[09:39:17] <JimmyXander> fair enough
[09:39:25] <jedimind> ideally in jsfiddle or something similar

[09:50:57] <skypce> a question
[09:51:03] <skypce> what is wrong with this code please:

[09:51:04] <skypce>         jQuery('#libro-visitas').jqzoom();  }
[09:51:04] <skypce>     });
[09:52:14] <feathersanddown> jQuery(document).ready(function(){'oncomplete': function() { ....... } );    where ...........  you are trying to define a part of an object
[09:52:48] <JimmyXander> http://jsfiddle.net/AmfMW/1/
[09:52:52] <rbs> hey you. I`m using jquery.maskedinput.min.js and I have a mask rule set as $(".input-mask-cep").mask("99999-999",{placeholder:" ",completed:function(){alert("You typed the following: "+this.val());}}); ....

[09:52:52] <feathersanddown> syntaxis is wrong
[09:52:55] <JimmyXander> Why does this not work? http://jsfiddle.net/AmfMW/1/
[09:53:02] <NoiseEee> skypce: what are you trying to do? perhaps you just want: jQuery(function() { jQuery('#libro-visitas').jqzoom();  });
[09:53:17] <skypce> exellent thank you feathersanddown i will test now
[09:53:46] <feathersanddown> is more excellent NoiseEee code, seems what are you trying to do
[09:53:48] <feathersanddown> :)
[09:54:23] <jedimind> JimmyXander are you trying to incrimentally move that item over 50px at a time?
[09:54:30] <JimmyXander> no.
[09:54:36] <NoiseEee> JimmyXander: $(this) refers to the button, not the red square.
[09:54:41] <JimmyXander> yes
[09:54:52] <JimmyXander> the button has the value on it
[09:54:57] <NoiseEee> JimmyXander: the button is always in the same position.
[09:55:04] <jedimind> JimmyXander http://jsfiddle.net/AmfMW/5/ ?
[09:55:09] <JimmyXander> I"m not trying to move the button
[09:55:36] <JimmyXander> What did you change Jedi?
[09:55:46] <jedimind> you had a ; in the data-pos value
[09:55:55] <jedimind> data-pos='"-50px;"
[09:55:58] <jedimind> instead of just -50px
[09:57:14] <skypce> i am trying to add a zoom to the php ubergalleryh

[09:59:19] <feathersanddown> I have this question in jquery ui accordion: http://wstaw.org/m/2013/05/31/accordion.png
[09:59:36] <feathersanddown> why appear a white box when changing div background color ?
[09:59:42] <rtd1_> Does anyone know of a jQuery alternative to Highslide, that will allow me to load an external JSP inside an iframe, and allow it to be dragged around the page?
[09:59:54] <jedimind> JimmyXander you're welcome? :)
[10:00:02] <JimmyXander> thank you

[10:02:10] <skypce> i was added colorbox and jquery zoom
[10:02:14] <skypce> but it doesnt load
[10:02:24] <skypce> and i have jQuery no conflict loaded
[10:03:53] <Pavlov> whats the best way to make ajax requests keep retrying until they succeed?
[10:04:35] <feathersanddown> I have this question in jquery ui accordion: http://wstaw.org/m/2013/05/31/accordion.png : why appear a white box when changing div background color ?
[10:06:45] <shoky> feathersanddown: change it to "background"
[10:07:12] <wiherek> ok I have a div element following an img, and i need the div to be the img's caption
[10:07:16] <shoky> there's another "background" property already set that's doing it
[10:07:27] <wiherek> is there a way to position elements relative to its sibling?
[10:10:18] <feathersanddown> shoky: only writting "background: #color" overwrite whole background styles to none|zero values ?
[10:10:28] <feathersanddown> shoky: and yes, work =)
[10:11:18] <shoky> feathersanddown: yeah, otherwise you're only changing the background-color, but leaving the white background image that was already set
[10:11:29] <jeffsmykil> How do I check if an event is bound to an element if the element wasn't there immediately at page load and I used .on?
[10:11:41] <feathersanddown> ahh fine, thanks shoky for your help and time =)
[10:12:20] <shoky> jeffsmykil: you used .on() on a different element using delegation?
[10:13:10] <jeffsmykil> yeah so $(table).on('click', 'tr')
[10:13:16] <jeffsmykil> something like that
[10:13:24] <shoky> jeffsmykil: then the event is bound to the table element, not the tr
[10:13:34] <jeffsmykil> ooooooh
[10:13:39] <jeffsmykil> I guess that makes sense
[10:13:57] <jeffsmykil> how do I make sure it took?
[10:14:07] <jeffsmykil> trying to write a unit test to check all events are bound
[10:15:12] <shoky> mm i guess you can check the table element. donno how you're checking anyway
[10:15:14] <Eviltwin> I'd try triggering events and having the listener report the "this" associated with it
[10:15:32] <Eviltwin> Since triggering an event on the table itself shouldn't trigger the event listener
[10:15:52] <jeffsmykil> I was hoping i could do something like #foo.data('events')
[10:16:13] <Eviltwin> Well you can but what does that really tell you?
[10:16:38] <jeffsmykil> that it 'took'?
[10:16:42] <Eviltwin> The spec for how events are represented is internal
[10:16:45] <shoky> (and the syntax for getting that undocumented events data has changed in jq 1.9 btw)
[10:17:19] <Eviltwin> What you can rely on is that the function gets called
[10:17:30] <jeffsmykil> yeah that makes more sense I suppose
[10:18:08] <Eviltwin> That's really how the test should be done
[10:20:29] <jeffsmykil> new to this whole unit testing thing thanks Eviltwin
[10:22:11] <Hounddog> Hi, http://jsfiddle.net/vAyeh/ i am trying to get the detail to toggle in from bottom to top overlaying the content section... somehow not getting it
[10:22:27] <affine> hi everyone
[10:22:36] <affine> is there a callback for .data() changes?
[10:22:43] <Eviltwin> affine: No
[10:22:46] <affine> booo
[10:22:53] <affine> any good workarounds?
[10:23:06] <Eviltwin> Uh... maybe you can be more specific about your problem?
[10:23:37] <affine> hmm, trying to design something so I can set the text content of an element I am making with a single function
[10:23:53] <affine> so instead of finding the child with the class (which would work) I could just call .data('label','some_msg');
[10:24:19] <affine> and it'll set $(this).find('.label').first().text(even.data); or something
[10:24:33] <unnu> hey hounddog, margin-top:25px; on #detail
[10:24:40] <Eviltwin> affine: I would consider using the jQuery UI Widget pattern
[10:24:42] <Eviltwin> affine: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[10:24:55] <affine> sweet, I am using jquery ui
[10:25:09] <affine> Eviltwin, that's what I am doing
[10:25:17] <affine> just wondered if there was a way to avoid writing a plugin function for that
[10:25:37] <Eviltwin> Then what you should do is replace the _setOption function
[10:25:43] <Eviltwin> And have the label be an option
[10:25:51] <Eviltwin> Then your function will get called every time they change an option
[10:25:54] <Hounddog> unnu: ok, now i am seeing the toggle button... but it is not overlaying the content
[10:25:56] <unnu> Hounddog, http://jsfiddle.net/vAyeh/1/
[10:25:58] <Eviltwin> And you can do whatever you want with that
[10:26:36] <Hounddog> unnu: i want the detail to be above the content section
[10:26:44] <unnu> wait, do you wan't to cover up the content or be above it?
[10:26:51] <Hounddog> cover up the content
[10:28:25] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/vAyeh/2/
[10:28:27] <Hounddog> unnu: the animation should start at the bottom of content and cover up the complete content from bottom to top
[10:29:09] <rosieres> anyone familar with fancybox ? I want to access origWidth -> this is a array this.origWidth is undefined . . . -> http://jsfiddle.net/rsysweb/PFVxK/915/
[10:29:25] <Hounddog> anyway i keep trying...
[10:29:47] <Eviltwin> affine: Something like this: http://pastebin.com/p6qPeyBT
[10:30:32] <Eviltwin> You could also in your _create look up that element and store it in "this"
[10:30:38] <Eviltwin> So you don't have to look it back up every time
[10:31:59] <affine> EvilEmpire, seems sloppy
[10:32:09] <affine> I'm just going to pollute the global jquery namespace
[10:32:11] <affine> seems easier ;)
[10:33:04] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[10:33:37] <Eviltwin> I thought you said you were using jQuery UI widgets already
[10:33:42] <affine> I am
[10:34:05] <affine> but right now this calls for basically .draggable() behavior
[10:34:08] <affine> not really anything more than that.
[10:36:27] <Eviltwin> Well at least I didn't tell you how you could get a callback for .data()
[10:36:31] <Eviltwin> Since that'd arguably be even worse
[10:36:44] <Eviltwin> I've limited the damage you can do to the world
[10:37:18] <friedbyte> Hi, I have something like this, <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>. I have a click function on the <li>, but I want to keep the <a href="#"> from executing the <li> click function. Any idea on how I can make only the <li> respond to the click function, and keep the <a href="#">'s action default?
[10:38:29] <shoky> friedbyte: either check event.target in the li click handler, or add a click handler on the <a> that does event.stopPropagation() on the event argument
[10:39:59] <shoky> the first way is e.g.  $('li').click(function(e) { if ( $(e.target).is('a') ) return; ... })
[10:40:14] <Eviltwin> friedbyte: http://jsfiddle.net/BsnjU/
[10:40:50] <friedbyte> sweet, I'm going to try that!
[10:41:04] <Eviltwin> That will make the li handler fire for only clicks on the li, not on any children
[10:42:15] <Vasa> hey I have this: http://pastebin.com/gzqW6NTF   , what i want you to ask, is there any way for the 'data' in the sender to be turned into JSON upon sending rather than url encoded? I recieve x=5&y=N on the other side, and would like to recieve json, now I know I can stringify it right into the data but is there a prettier way to do that? maybe change some internals in any way?
[10:43:53] <friedbyte> shoky, eviltwin: thanks for your help, that was perfect!
[10:45:01] <Vasa> like there is the proccessData method but is it activated upon recieving the data or upon sending it and how do i specify it there?
[10:47:11] <feathersanddown> grgrgrgrgr
[10:47:47] <Vasa> friedbyte you can return false on the event that is attached to the <li>
[10:47:49] <Vasa> or prevent default
[10:48:00] <Eviltwin> Vasa: I think you can just do data: JSON.stringify({"x":5,"y":"N"})
[10:48:05] <Eviltwin> In your $.ajax({ ... })
[10:48:13] <Voting> I need to get good at doing general animation stuff. I'm finding myself confused. What are the jquery queues for? What are the best things to read about using jquery UI to do very general animation stuff?
[10:48:15] <Vasa> eviltwin yes thats what i said but is there a prettier way than that
[10:48:35] <Vasa> eviltwin I mean json stringify is not supported everywhere so I have to look for fallbacks
[10:48:42] <rosieres> Anyone can tell me why I cannot reach an object item ? I want to access origWidth -> this is a array this.origWidth is undefined . . . -> http://jsfiddle.net/rsysweb/PFVxK/915/
[10:49:34] <Eviltwin> Vasa: It's now supported almost everywhere. You should download and include this in your page if you're worried: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json2.js
[10:49:47] <Vasa> eviltwin: include and forget, right?
[10:50:07] <Vasa> thanks for the help eviltwin
[10:54:32] <Voting> I need to get good at doing general animation stuff. I'm finding myself confused. What are the jquery queues for? What are the best things to read about using jquery UI to do very general animation stuff?
[10:58:59] <Eviltwin> Voting: jQuery's animation features allow you to tween CSS properties
[10:59:25] <Eviltwin> That is if the element is at left: 0px and you say .animate("left", "100px") it will over the course of time set it to the pixel values in between
[10:59:40] <Eviltwin> Like 1px, 2px, 3px, 4px, ... 98px, 99px, 100px
[11:00:17] <Eviltwin> The reason there are queues is you might want to go .animate("left", "100px").animate("top", "100px") and have it go from (0, 0) to (100, 0) to (100, 100)
[11:00:34] <Eviltwin> The queues make the next animation wait until the first is complete
[11:01:51] <rosieres> Voting: isn´t that selfexplanatory ? -> http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[11:12:46] <rsimpson_> Does anyone know where I can find information about keyed singletons? I had someone mention it to me but can't find anything on Google about it

[11:50:52] <LEU> I spend my entire day searching for a solution to my issue please have mercy on me and help me !
[11:51:12] <LEU> Is there anybody that can help me with my droppable promblem ? http://jsfiddle.net/jKRsZ/3/ I have to make an event that turns droppable back to enabled after you drag out the item
[11:53:05] <clov3r> LEU: sorry from here
[11:53:14] <clov3r> no idea
[11:53:26] <clov3r> but i didn't want you to feel ignored
[11:53:28] <clov3r> again.
[11:54:04] <thang> LEU: what do you want that fiddle to do exactly?
[11:54:07] <LEU> thank
[11:54:30] <LEU> after I drop the ring on the pink slot i want to disable droppable
[11:54:40] <LEU> and when i drag it out i want to enable droppable
[11:55:17] <LEU> see ? there are 2 slots for ring drop in one switch to other one and then switch back
[11:55:21] <LEU> it doesn`t work
[11:55:22] <bot-t> LEU, Is there a real problem with more than 2 J-query in the same website? - Opened 22 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10091
[11:57:27] <rosieres> LEU -> droppable('option', 'disabled', true) && droppable('option', 'disabled', false) should help . . .. by the way, use the console.log()
[11:57:53] <LEU> i used it
[11:58:19] <LEU> i have there o function itemOut that handle the out event
[11:59:33] <rosieres> the function is calles outItem() and you set ('enable') instead of (disabled, false)
[12:01:16] <LEU> that function is the problem
[12:01:24] <rosieres> LEU -> disabledType: Boolean Default: false  -> Disables the droppable if set to true.
[12:01:39] <rosieres> NOT ENABLED !
[12:01:41] <LEU> it isn't trigged when i drag out after drop item
[12:02:15] <pythonirc1011> I've a list L and a set of groups G which comprise of subsets of L. I need a selection mechanism such that my users can de/select elements from the list. Or de/select groups. When one selects a group, all elements of L that are part of that group should be slelected. Any ideas on how to make this widget using jquery? Perhaps someone knows such a widget and can point me to it?
[12:02:25] <LEU> i changed it but still doesn't work
[12:03:05] <rosieres> use the console.log() to determine your results . .. I don´t see any . . . but I have to go further with my own things. . .
[12:03:26] <LEU> if you know how to make it work i'm extremly happy change it and send me back your solution
[12:04:33] <thang> LEU: im going to suggest keeping track of state in javascript, so that when you catch the drop event, you know which boxes are full. then scan children of #equipmentpic and disable the ones youve kept track of
[12:06:50] <LEU> thang: so you say that is better to try with javascript not with jQuery
[12:07:38] <jshultz> can someone give me a hand with this SO question? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16847074/links-dont-work-after-hitting-back-button-in-iphone5
[12:07:50] <eedfwchris> Quicky… after you do data = $form.serializeArray(); can you pull a value by "name"?
[12:08:12] <NoiseEee> eedfwchris: seems like the sorta thing you could try yourself
[12:08:17] <NoiseEee> you know, inspect data or something
[12:08:32] <eedfwchris> well i did but it's an array of just 0,1,2,3,4,5
[12:08:38] <eedfwchris> not sure how to get it by "name"
[12:08:56] <thang> semantics, you need to use jquery to capture the events and use draggable. im suggesting keeping track of the boxes after drop events so you know when if/when something gets changed.
[12:08:56] <NoiseEee> what is a "name" ?
[12:09:01] <thang> name attr maybe
[12:09:32] <eedfwchris> NoiseEee: it's a param of an object, in an array of objects?
[12:10:40] <NoiseEee> eedfwchris: http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[12:12:05] <eedfwchris> not sure how that helps.
[12:12:19] <thang> jshultz: you could try hooking up a remote debugger with an ios sim, to determine whether its platform specific or theres unseen dom manipulation
[12:12:27] <eedfwchris> i'd have to do data[3][value] still?
[12:13:03] <jshultz> i've been using xCode and running various iOS devices through it and seems to be only iOS 6.0
[12:13:07] <jshultz> and 6.1
[12:13:08] <NoiseEee> eedfwchris: why bother trying to grab a value from the serialized array versus the real value in the form?
[12:13:13] <jshultz> because on Nexus 4 it works fine.
[12:13:31] <eedfwchris> NoiseEee: I guess I could do that.
[12:14:53] <jshultz> @thang I just tried it again in iPhone 5.1 simulator and it works
[12:15:12] <thang> jshultz: eek.
[12:15:28] <jshultz> so yeah, it's just iPhone 6.0 and newer
[12:16:50] <thang> jshultz: my only suggestion is to compare the dom on first visit, then on back button. thats a really strange issue. i ran into some ios specific problems in the browser as well and theyre pretty poorly documented so youre generally left to find something that works vs trying to make your own thing work
[12:17:04] <eedfwchris> NoiseEee: okay maybe this is the answer to your question heh… I can't do $form.find(':input[name="submit"').val() because I want the value of whichever of those name="submit" got clicked.
[12:18:16] <eedfwchris> I could pass that from the bind() but I feel like the data is right there in the serialized array
[12:19:18] <jshultz> @thang ok, thanks.
[12:20:44] <eedfwchris> meh
[12:20:45] <NoiseEee> eedfwchris: consider buttons that submit instead of multiple submit buttons.  and yes, why not grab it on the submit?  $('button','.submit',function(e) { //figure out what buttons was pressed, do what you want, serialize form});
[12:24:56] <juria_roberts> I have a $('#search-btn').live('click',function(){  now i want to put an enter key press event which does the same thing but dont want to write the function twice.What do I do?
[12:30:48] <juria_roberts> anyone?
[12:35:30] <Eviltwin> juria_roberts: Is there a reason you don't let the browser do that for you? http://i.imgur.com/ve6bVhT.png
[12:35:33] <Eviltwin> ...
[12:35:35] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/35aBB/
[12:36:38] <juria_roberts> Eviltwin: i am using ajax
[12:36:58] <Eviltwin> Oh, I am using alerts
[12:37:18] <jost> juria_roberts: you could write the function once, and bind it to multiple events.
[12:37:23] <juria_roberts> Eviltwin: are u really evil? im not using forms
[12:37:43] <Eviltwin> Please notice how if you type something and press enter or type something and click the button the page doesn't go anywhere
[12:37:46] <Eviltwin> There's just an alert
[12:37:47] <jshultz> @thang since it seems only a hard refresh can get the links working again. I've been trying to find a way to create that hard refresh on the back button. do you have any suggestions?
[12:37:49] <juria_roberts> jost: ok
[12:37:56] <Eviltwin> Replace alert("Search!") with your AJAX
[12:38:19] <juria_roberts> Eviltwin: ohh u did return false
[12:38:50] <juria_roberts> Eviltwin: thanks that will work 2
[12:39:04] <juria_roberts> Eviltwin: I misjudged u
[12:41:17] <jshultz> ok. i think i'm pinning it down.
[12:41:28] <jshultz> one thing that is different is that there is a slideshow on the home page
[12:41:31] <jshultz> it uses jquerytools
[12:41:39] <jshultz> could that be causing the issue?
[12:42:19] <jshultz> on the other pages, i can hit the back button and links still work. it's just on the home page.
[12:46:40] <jshultz> nope, it wasn't the scroll. :(
[12:57:06] <banisterfiend> anyone here familiar with the 'ace' editor? perhaps you know the answer to this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16864236/how-to-mark-line-numbers-in-javascript-ace-editor
[12:57:08] <banisterfiend> :D
[13:06:50] <jedimind> banisterfiend so all youre trying to do is make it so that when you click on the line number, it puts a cursor in that line ?
[13:07:16] <jedimind> oh wait nevermind i read that wrong
[13:12:15] <JohnnyCache> is that ok to define onclick even to an element by $(obj).onclick = 'function()' ?
[13:12:26] <JohnnyCache> event*
[13:13:22] <JohnnyCache> #@ i mean:
[13:13:32] <JohnnyCache> $(obj).attr("onclick","function()")
[13:13:34] <JohnnyCache> lolz
[13:13:57] <juria_roberts> JohnnyCache: good name
[13:14:16] <JohnnyCache> :D
[13:14:23] <juria_roberts> JohnnyCache: wish i had thought of it first
[13:14:31] <JohnnyCache> :)
[13:14:39] <JohnnyCache> it seems very simple to me actually
[13:14:45] <JohnnyCache> the question is, if that's ok
[13:14:52] <JohnnyCache> or anyone ever had problems with this method
[13:15:39] <Eviltwin> Don't use onclick, please!
[13:15:49] <JohnnyCache> why not?
[13:15:54] <jshultz> ok, so it definitely seems to be the way the link's are. i removed step by step all the content from the main body copy including slideshows and you tube videos. nothing changed.
[13:15:56] <Eviltwin> It's a bad practice
[13:16:10] <JohnnyCache> :S
[13:16:12] <Eviltwin> ?on @ JohnnyCache
[13:16:12] <bot-t> JohnnyCache, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:16:12] <d0100> hello guys, what should I do when jquery code only works on Chrome?
[13:16:25] <d0100> any easy way of debugging?
[13:16:33] <jshultz> but I did find out that links in the menu, and footer, both still work and I can go back/forth between the home page and sub pages and everything works. but as soon as i click a link from within the body and go back to the home page then everything stops.
[13:17:12] <JohnnyCache> Eviltwin: ok, thanks mate
[13:20:24] <JohnnyCache> Question:
[13:20:42] <JohnnyCache> I have a function that get one attribute: id

[13:21:04] <banister_> jedimind: dc sorry
[13:21:06] <JohnnyCache> 	$("#formComment"+id+" .tagToolbar span[data-tag]").on("click", function(event,id)
[13:21:06] <JohnnyCache> 	{	
[13:21:06] <JohnnyCache> 		addTag($(this).data("tag"),id)
[13:21:06] <JohnnyCache> 	});
[13:21:17] <JohnnyCache> but "id" gives nothing
[13:21:36] <JohnnyCache> it leaves it empty
[13:21:45] <jedimind> dont paste code in the channel
[13:21:55] <JohnnyCache> ok sry
[13:22:15] <Eviltwin> Use pastebin or pastie or something
[13:22:16] <jedimind> banister_ thats okay i wont hold it against you, not sure why you're telling me though :)
[13:22:35] <banister_> jedimind: we were talking before i dc

[14:27:15] <affine_> right now it spawns in the top left of the container
[14:39:04] <dcope> is there a way to get a child element in a selector?
[14:39:17] <dcope> ie $(this).children("td > span") would get <td><span> ?
[14:41:28] <dcope> oh, find does it
[14:52:37] <glynch> exit
[14:56:04] <shoky> affine_: css?
[14:56:11] <savid> I don't suppose anyone knows of a tool that allows you to track a piece of js code that is responsible for a change in the UI?  For example, if the CSS "color" property changes, I want to find out what is responsible for changing it.
[14:56:18] <affine_> shoky, already tried.
[14:56:37] <savid> I'm not sure if there's a js event that I can hook into that does this.
[14:56:44] <shoky> affine_: if something doesn't work, make a jsfiddle
[14:57:26] <affine_> will do :) thanks
[14:57:27] <affine_> one bit

[14:58:48] <affine_> I want the node to appear under the cursor

[15:25:52] <dan2k3k4> how to override background-image with an empty value?
[15:26:08] <dan2k3k4> i.e. $(ele).css("background-image", ""); - doesn't seem to do anything
[15:26:11] <sunbeam> i have a list of domain names, and i would like to check whether these are up or down
[15:26:14] <sunbeam> can i do this with node.js?
[15:26:46] <shoky> you can check if you can reach them.. sure
[15:27:28] <sunbeam> shoky: ok, but why would someone do this with node.js
[15:27:35] <sunbeam> eg. ask the developer to do this with node.js
[15:28:34] <dan2k3k4> using $(ele).css("background-image", "none"); works
[15:28:45] <dan2k3k4> but I assume it's not valid setting for background-image ?
[15:29:18] <shoky> sunbeam: why not?
[15:30:03] <sunbeam> shoky: i don't know, it could be as easily done with PHP
[15:30:15] <shoky> sunbeam: and it could be as easily done with node.js, what's your point?
[15:30:45] <sunbeam> shoky: you know any example how it can be done with node.js?
[15:32:22] <shoky> sunbeam: i don't know node.js very well, but uhh they have http.get()  or http.request() for example
[15:33:58] <ajpiano> sunbeam: #Node.js
[15:35:43] <sunbeam> ajpiano: wow big channel
[15:36:13] <ajpiano> yeah you'd almost think that large companies were using node at scale and there were conferences and an entire community around it

[15:50:48] <shoky> clov3r: that's the actual exception text? what's the code line causing it?
[15:52:12] <shoky> clov3r: anyway my guess would be that you're including something that's overwriting $ or something
[15:52:38] <clov3r> $('#pass').on("change", function() { //check $(this).val() against store });
[15:53:16] <shoky> are you including some other lib like prototype or mootools or i donno

[17:00:49] <shoky> aliensky: because you have a syntax error
[17:01:02] <shoky> aliensky: try to see what you did different when you added that 4th image....
[17:01:13] <shoky> and look at your console :\
[17:01:23] <aliensky> i added html code
[17:01:32] <aliensky> you can see it at the end of pastebin

[17:19:19] <DoctorMonocular_> hey everyone -- quick question: I am loading an element via ajax, and I don't have access to the code that loads it. However, when it starts existing in the dom I want to do stuff to it at that moment. What event fires when an element has been injected into the DOM and is now ready?
[17:20:23] <DoctorMonocular_> I already tried $('body').on ('ready', '#mynewelement',...)
[17:20:28] <DoctorMonocular_> but no dice
[17:22:32] <ivaylov> is this what you are looking for
[17:22:33] <ivaylov> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3900151/is-there-a-jquery-event-that-fires-when-a-new-node-is-inserted-into-the-dom
[17:26:29] <DoctorMonocular_> ivaylov the selected answer there is years old, surely it's out of date? Maybe the DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument event is supported by jquery now?
[17:27:16] <tw2113> wouldn't that just be a shorthand for the javascript version in the end anyway?
[17:28:50] <DoctorMonocular_> tw2113 eyah I'm just trying to see if I can watch for that event with .on right now, I think it won't work because apparently the event doesn't bubble
[17:29:06] <tw2113> according to MDN, DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument is depreciated
[17:29:33] <DoctorMonocular_> damn. So what are my options here? I can't be the only one who needs this
[17:29:38] <DoctorMonocular_> maybe I can fake it
[17:34:48] <namidark> I have a a few .click bound to 3 diff CSS classes, one of them causes the parent's CSS class to change (and it does) - but the .click isn't rebindng once the css class is changed - what do i need to do to fix that?
[17:35:25] <DoctorMonocular_> namidark is it a .on() binding?
[17:35:33] <Guest43845> Oh no, my nickname!
[17:36:00] <namidark> DoctorMonocular_: its a $('.class').click(function() { }); binding
[17:37:11] <DoctorMonocular_> namidark that's surprising that it's unbinding in that case, I didn't think it would. I guess the easiest workaround is to attach it to a different class that doesn't change
[17:37:46] <namidark> hmm well I need it to change since its based on a css class and its changing the display and functionality :\
[17:38:00] <DoctorMonocular_> what I'm saying is that you have your 3 classes
[17:38:03] <DoctorMonocular_> that need to change
[17:38:07] <DoctorMonocular_> add another arbitrary one
[17:38:12] <namidark> ahhhh
[17:38:13] <DoctorMonocular_> that you select for on the click event
[17:38:15] <namidark> i see
[17:38:16] <namidark> :)
[17:38:16] <DoctorMonocular_> and that doesn't changfe
[17:39:57] <namidark> hmm well that didn't work either
[17:40:12] <namidark> should I be using something else to change the class section other than .attr?
[17:43:42] <DoctorMonocular_> yeah
[17:43:50] <DoctorMonocular_> namidark use addClass or removeClass
[17:44:46] <DoctorMonocular_> but it really shouldn't be disconnecting the events, I think there are shenanigans afoot
[18:01:17] <namidark> DoctorMonocular_: hm, that works still, but the event's arent firing... not sure a good way to give you the example since its coffee script :\
[18:02:55] <samholmes> why isn't .sort() documented?

[18:34:30] <tw2113> bah

[18:46:02] <Blaster> hello
[18:46:15] <Blaster> I am having a weird issue where console.log doesn't work but alert() does
[18:46:17] <Blaster> in Firefox
[18:48:12] <Eviltwin> Firefox doesn't (or didn't used to) have console.log by default
[18:48:18] <Eviltwin> That would be added by Firebug
[18:48:39] <Eviltwin> The "console" object wasn't defined so even trying to refer to console or console.log would cause an error
[18:49:10] <Blaster> I have firebug
[18:49:18] <Blaster> everything is working but console.log it's weird
[18:49:25] <Blaster> if I type console.log into the firebug console it works though
[18:49:30] <Blaster> but not if I output that on my page
[18:50:09] <Eviltwin> Are you opening Firebug after the page loads?
[18:50:30] <Blaster> no
[18:54:11] <Blaster> Reinstalling Firebug fixed the situation
[18:54:15] <Blaster> EvilTwin ^
[18:57:12] <Eviltwin> I'd suggest doing something like window.console || (window.console = { log: function () {} }); somewhere before your code that uses console.log
[18:57:18] <Eviltwin> Just in case it's not there, it won't explode
[18:57:29] <Eviltwin> And you won't need to do a if (window.console) before every console.log

[20:05:09] <JohnnyCache> Guys, need your help:
[20:06:00] <JohnnyCache> Im trying to build a script like having a soccer field and a list of players, need a good drag n drop script to drag a player from a list and put it on the field, any knowledge about good plugin that can help me with that? :)
[20:07:01] <shoky> JohnnyCache: jquery-ui's is fine
[20:07:53] <JohnnyCache> ok ill try :) thanks
[20:09:19] <tw2113> how do i jQuery, shoky ?
[20:10:16] <aliensky> what is the difference betweeen jquery and javascript?
[20:11:11] <Bloc> if i slap this keyboard hard enough can i be a monkey?
[20:12:45] <tw2113> function Bloc() { return true; }
[20:13:19] <tw2113> aliensky, jQuery is javascript, javascript is NOT jQuery
[20:15:35] <Rinthe> i wanna find the visible space between the top of an image to the top of the browser, not the scrollable space. anyone haev any ideas?
[20:15:58] <tw2113> you want to measure the toolbars and whatnot?
[20:23:36] <JohnnyCache> jQuery is freakin' awesome.
[20:25:01] <JohnnyCache> I'm in love with it. my previous employer insisted that i will create a drag n drop without jQuery for his stupid abortive website and i just did in 5 minutes that amazing shit. <3 jQuery!
[20:25:36] <Rinthe> tw2113, hmm not the toolbars
[20:25:44] <Rinthe> say thers an image in the middle of the page
[20:25:46] <Rinthe> you scroll to it
[20:25:49] <aliensky> how to learn jquery
[20:26:09] <aliensky> do you guys just use scripts or you handcode it?
[20:26:11] <Rinthe> and say thers space between the top of that image and the top of the browser window
[20:26:15] <Rinthe> i wanna find out that spacde
[20:26:49] <Rinthe> scripts are handcoded lol
[20:28:28] <tw2113> i think you need to select the image and then get it's offset relative to the window
[20:28:39] <tw2113> and you want it as close to 0 as you can
[20:29:07] <tw2113> if anyone corrects me, i wouldn't be surprised
[20:29:09] <Rinthe> tw2113: do i use scrolltop?
[20:29:20] <tw2113> sounds good, worth testing with
[20:29:34] <Rinthe> k thanks
[20:44:40] <Rinthe> tw2113: can't use scrolltop on images
[20:44:43] <Rinthe> can i use something else
[20:46:05] <tw2113> wrap the image in a div
[20:46:12] <tw2113> or something else that will work with scrolltop
[20:57:54] <Rinthe> tw2113: i did that, it's always 0
[20:58:22] <tw2113> the image relative to the div? or the div relative to window?
[21:00:29] <Rinthe> tw2113: im not sure, how do i find out?
[21:01:56] <tw2113> i dunno how you're doing it now, can't see code
[21:11:37] <lenswipe> hey guys
[21:11:45] <lenswipe> anyone know if it's possible to post files with $.ajax
[21:13:00] <tw2113> i assume yes
[21:13:27] <tw2113> http://www.openjs.com/articles/ajax/ajax_file_upload/
[21:13:37] <tw2113> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/uploading-files-with-ajax/
[21:14:06] <tw2113> http://www.queness.com/post/11434/7-javascript-ajax-file-upload-plugins
[21:15:02] <lenswipe> tw2113, notice I said $.ajax
[21:15:22] <tw2113> ah so you want paid to upload
[21:15:23] <lenswipe> none of the links you posted use jquery
[21:15:37] <lenswipe> tw2113, no - I want to use jquery to upload files
[21:15:45] <lenswipe> tw2113, ...this is the jQuery channel...
[21:15:51] <lenswipe> $.ajax means the jQuery ajax object
[21:16:06] <tw2113> so look at the js parts and switch in the jQuery equivalents
[21:16:17] <lenswipe> /facepalm
[21:16:18] <b-ot> lenswipe: http://i1352.photobucket.com/albums/q641/Wolfkindcx/DoubleFacepalm2_zps6e8e47eb.jpg
[21:16:24] <tw2113> jQuery = js
[21:16:34] <lenswipe> I know it's JS
[21:16:46] <yedimind> gtfo
[21:16:50] <yedimind> jquery=js ?!?!
[21:16:55] <tw2113> oh hey....the tutsplus one USES JQUERY
[21:16:55] <lenswipe> I'm asking if the jQuery ajax method accepts files as arg....nevermind
[21:17:04] <lenswipe> yedimind, do you understand my question?
[21:17:08] <tw2113> "We?re using jQuery to handle all the oddities of AJAX across browsers."
[21:17:15] <yedimind> its midnight on a friday and i am high as a kite
[21:17:20] <yedimind> i dont even understand how im operating this laptop
[21:17:22] <yedimind> let alone your question
[21:17:28] <lenswipe> yedimind, penis
[21:17:33] <tw2113> your cat is typing for you yedimind
[21:17:40] <tw2113> lenswipe, pay attention, tutsplus is using jquery
[21:17:55] <jedimind> lenswipe: are you looking for a way to upload files via jquery?
[21:18:05] <jedimind> rather through an xhr
[21:18:17] <jedimind> http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[21:18:22] <tw2113> and hey...the 3rd link....has jQuery plugins!
[21:18:23] <jedimind> did you take a look at that?
[21:18:28] <jedimind> tw2113:  stop being a twat
[21:18:40] <jedimind> he gets it, his balls are sufficiently busted, move on
[21:18:45] <tw2113> just correcting someone who was wrong on the internet
[21:19:16] <jedimind> lenswipe: ?
[21:19:34] <lenswipe> jedimind, oh sorry
[21:19:38] <lenswipe> jedimind, yes
[21:20:11] <lenswipe> tw2113, so they are - my bad.
[21:20:14] <lenswipe> apologies
[21:20:18] <tw2113> :D

[21:23:49] <lenswipe> $('shoky').on('fap',function(){ alert("OOOHhhhhhhhyeaaah right there baby! mmmmm"});
[21:23:51] <lenswipe> FTFY
[21:24:02] * tw2113 didn't do it
[21:24:26] <shoky> im just waiting for console.fap()
[21:24:36] <lenswipe> shoky, it's already there in google chrome canary
[21:24:39] <lenswipe> console.table()
[21:24:41] <lenswipe> sooo nice
[21:24:49] <shoky> is that a thing?
[21:24:49] <lenswipe> ...well - I came a little bit anyway when I saw it ;O
[21:24:56] <lenswipe> shoky, it sure is
[21:25:19] <lenswipe> shoky, it looks like this: https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kET4K-7W_go/USUwXuX6_bI/AAAAAAAAx6Q/6GUY7-JRHNs/w800-h800/ponies.jpg
[21:25:28] <lenswipe> ...without the pony O_o
[21:25:33] <shoky> nice
[21:25:40] <shoky> i have it in stable as well
[21:25:58] <shoky> my pony stable that is
[21:26:05] <lenswipe> e_e
[21:26:20] <tw2113> --
[21:26:20] <tw2113> console.fap = console.log || function(){};
[21:26:32] <shoky> now you've done it
[21:26:43] <shoky> my life is complete
[21:27:08] <tw2113> drat, no console.table in firefox native
[21:27:40] <lenswipe> tw2113, there is in firebug though
[21:27:43] <tw2113> firebug has it though
[21:27:55] <jedimind> HEY
[21:27:58] <jedimind> I THINK FIREBUG HAS IT
[21:28:04] <lenswipe> does firebug have it?
[21:28:16] <tw2113> shoky, do you even $(), bro?
[21:31:12] * lenswipe slams tw2113's penis in a car door to get his attention
[21:31:41] <unnu> maybe try firebug?
[21:31:44] <tw2113> so that's where my penis is
[21:31:45] <shoky> damn dude, that hurts just reading
[21:31:47] <shoky> it
[21:31:52] <lenswipe> shoky, hehe :p]
[21:31:52] <tw2113> *curls over in pain*
[21:32:06] <lenswipe> xD
[21:32:10] <tw2113> can someone smack me in the vagina and see if i react to that too>
[21:32:18] <shoky> is $() your vagina
[21:32:21] <unnu> cURL over in pain?
[21:32:21] * lenswipe sews up tw2113's vagina
[21:32:24] <shoky> cause that's what it looks like
[21:32:37] <lenswipe> shoky, so that's why you were passing objects into it?
[21:32:39] <shoky> jQuery shaped pubes
[21:32:49] <tw2113> we have no filters for our fingers tonight
[21:32:51] <shoky> on the.. side.
[21:32:57] <lenswipe> tw2113, I never have filters on my fingers
[21:32:59] <tw2113> i assume i'm the only one actually yelling what i say at my computer
[21:33:07] <shoky> lol
[21:33:40] <lenswipe> shoky, tw2113, one of my friends made a JS VNC client and had to have event binders in it and I added /"/fill these binders with women" (Mitt Romney reference) into his code thinking he would find it...
[21:33:53] <lenswipe> ....he nearly handed it in as his dissertation code
[21:33:59] <lenswipe> he was pissed
[21:34:00] <lenswipe> xD
[21:34:05] <lenswipe> totally worth it though
[21:34:17] <tw2113> ack! politics
[21:34:28] <shoky> ^^
[21:34:29] <tw2113> they both sucked
[21:34:41] <lenswipe> tw2113, true  - still a good opportunity for a laugh though
[21:34:55] <tw2113> i voted 3rd Party!
[21:35:02] <tw2113> yes, there's more than 2
[21:36:45] <lenswipe> shoky, jquery pubes: $#()#   :)
[21:36:47] <lenswipe> shoky, FTFY
[21:37:04] <shoky> ah yes now i recognize tw2113
[21:37:13] <lenswipe> shoky, you do?
[21:37:17] <lenswipe> from /r/gonewild?
[21:37:22] <shoky> ;]
[21:37:30] <lenswipe> *tilts head*
[21:37:32] <lenswipe> ah yes!
[21:37:39] <shoky> ~_~
[21:37:43] <tw2113> here i thought shoky was in /r/thick
[21:37:46] <tw2113> like a REAL MAN
[21:38:16] <lenswipe> shoky, i'd take that as a compliment on the thickness of your penis if I were you.. (I think she might have seen your fapping)
[21:38:19] <tw2113> do you even deeznuts, bro?
[21:39:08] <shoky> derp, i thought girth was the thing these days
[21:39:18] <lenswipe> shoky, it's a real problem for me
[21:39:24] <lenswipe> I can't buy condoms anymore...
[21:39:31] <lenswipe> ...not since the shipyard ran out of tarpaulin...
[21:39:42] <tw2113> allegedly, you need to get it in before you can stretch it out
[21:40:09] <lenswipe> nah - you gotta jerk it out
[21:40:09] <lenswipe> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an6A-Wu6-B4
[21:40:30] <Eviltwin> Been a while since I've heard that song
[21:40:34] <Eviltwin> But can someone tell me
[21:40:40] <lenswipe> iPod commercials anyone?
[21:40:40] <Eviltwin> How does any of this relate to jQuery?
[21:40:54] <lenswipe> Eviltwin, I don't think it does - we're just screwing around
[21:41:03] <tw2113> we're being bad boys
[21:41:12] <tw2113> it was all shoky's idea, he wanted to get us all some spankings
[21:41:17] <voidpirate> what did I join into 0_o
[21:41:28] <lenswipe> voidpirate, this is the spanking channel - bend over
[21:41:36] <lenswipe> voidpirate, tw2113 is administering the spankings ;)
[21:41:39] <suprbly> trolling is fun sometimes i guess
[21:41:42] * voidpirate gets spanked
[21:41:44] <tw2113> hardly
[21:41:49] <lenswipe> * voidpirate gets spanked
[21:41:50] <lenswipe> <tw2113> hardly
[21:41:52] <lenswipe> perfect timing
[21:42:00] <tw2113> shiiiit
[21:42:19] <tw2113> var hardly = 'not at all';
[21:42:37] <tw2113> forgot to declare my variable
[21:43:22] <lenswipe> tw2113, I can't see that - it's not within my scope
[21:43:32] <tw2113> tldr
[21:44:27] <tw2113> trollolololol
[21:44:42] <shoky> `k trollolololol
[21:44:48] <shoky> :(
[21:45:59] <lenswipe> okay.jpg
[21:46:54] <shoky> this was fun i hope y'all have learned something
[21:47:33] <lenswipe> indeed
[21:47:37] <lenswipe> so yeh - back on topic
[21:47:44] <shoky> poooonies
[21:47:54] <lenswipe> if I want to upload an image using $.ajax is it possible to do it without window.FormData?
[21:48:17] <tw2113> i should start messaging girls on $datingSite saying if they drink crappy beer and if we dated, I'd get the perk of getting to feel elitist over my beer compared to them
[21:48:18] <lenswipe> could I just post the base64 encoded image?
[21:50:46] <tw2113> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15259632/upload-image-as-base64-with-jquery-ajax
[21:51:07] <lenswipe>  if ( window.FileReader ) {
[21:51:07] <lenswipe>                     reader = new FileReader();
[21:51:10] <lenswipe> /vomit
[21:51:43] <tw2113> you get used to it
[21:51:48] <tw2113> or become bullemic
[21:51:58] <lenswipe> the FileReader API is horrible
[21:53:22] <lenswipe> is there a way to make the upload dialog allow certain file types only?
[21:53:36] <tw2113> you can reject after checking what type it is
[21:53:43] <tw2113> if certain file type, return
[21:53:45] <lenswipe> you can but I was hoping to avoid that
[21:53:53] <tw2113> you ask too much
[21:53:58] <tw2113> why can't it be this way, or that way
[21:54:10] <lenswipe> because reasons
[21:54:12] <lenswipe> :/
[21:55:43] <tw2113> lenswipe, have you realized why so many people write their own libraries?
[21:55:51] <tw2113> they get tired of dealing with this stuff too
[21:55:57] <lenswipe> indeed
[21:56:14] <lenswipe> i was just hoping that jQuery allowed for base64 image uploads, heh :<
[21:56:19] <tw2113> it may
[21:56:21] <tw2113> i dunno
[21:56:23] <tw2113> have you googled?
[21:56:27] <lenswipe> currently doing so
[21:56:32] <lenswipe> OP will post back with results
[21:56:33] <tw2113> asking in here on a friday night won't get much results
[21:56:47] <lenswipe> it's saturday morning where I am :p
[21:56:48] <dcherman> base64 is just a string, you can POST that if you want.
[21:57:07] <lenswipe> dcherman, doesn't the base64 represent the image?
[21:57:16] <tw2113> base64 represents string
[21:57:18] <lenswipe> asin - is it not possible to base64 decode that into a usable image?
[21:57:20] <tw2113> it decodes into an image
[21:57:28] <lenswipe> yeah
[21:57:41] <tw2113> but the actual bas64 string is just that
[21:57:44] <tw2113> string of characters
[21:57:50] <lenswipe> right
[21:57:55] <voidpirate> please read: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader
[21:57:59] <tw2113> can you $.post string?
[21:58:00] <lenswipe> but I can run base64_decode() on it and get the image out the other end, right?
[21:58:05] <tw2113> yes
[21:58:06] <dcherman> lenswipe: yes
[21:58:09] <lenswipe> delightful :)
[21:58:49] <tw2113> because....reasons!
[22:03:37] <meowcat> i  reading a tutorial on JSON and it says if you use AJAX you run into a wall when trying to use RSS feeds
[22:03:39] <meowcat> http://www.copterlabs.com/blog/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/
[22:03:50] <meowcat> These sites provide RSS feeds, which are easy to import and use on the server-side, but if we try to load them with AJAX, we run into a wall: we can only load an RSS feed if were requesting it from the same domain its hosted on.
[22:04:14] <meowcat> but... if i wanted a twitter RSS feed, it would be hosted on twitter no?
[22:04:59] <shoky> meowcat: some APIs let you connect to them from a different domain, using stuff like CORS or hacks like JSONP
[22:05:01] <meowcat> or does it mean that with ajax you only can request data from the site you are on
[22:05:23] <shoky> meowcat: but if the site doesnt do any of that then what you say is true, yes
[22:05:51] <meowcat> oh i see :] thanks. what does the P stand for in JSONP ?
[22:06:18] <shoky> Padding i think,
[22:07:04] <meowcat> the tutorial says: JSON allows us to overcome the cross-domain issue because we can use a method called JSONP that uses a callback function to send the JSON data back to our domain
[22:07:55] <shoky> JSONP means adding a <script> tag to your <head> that loads the script from the server that way
[22:08:10] <shoky> but it loads javascript not JSON
[22:08:16] <meowcat> so does your browser (when using jasonp) ask your sites server to ask for json and then the json is recieved back from twitter and then your local server (domain you are visiting) sends it to your browser?
[22:08:34] <shoky> no
[22:08:43] <shoky> JSONP is direct browser->remote server
[22:09:01] <shoky> but using a <script> element
[22:09:05] <meowcat> right so why is the call back needed?
[22:09:14] <shoky> because <script>'s can only load javascript
[22:09:16] <tw2113> because that's what makes timetravel work!
[22:09:23] <tw2113> oh, wrong topic
[22:09:33] <shoky> ;p
[22:10:15] <meowcat> so the callback would be used for some serverside application of the data e.g caching
[22:10:29] <shoky> no
[22:10:45] <shoky> the callback is there because something has to be called, otherwise nothing would happen
[22:11:00] <shoky> if you load a <script>  that just has some data without any code.. it wouldnt do anything
[22:11:15] <shoky> putting the callback there allows you to get the data that's supplied to the callback
[22:11:53] <meowcat> oh, so the callback is the callback function that actually has twitter send its data to your browser?
[22:11:57] <shoky> jquery puts <script src="http://otherdomain/bla.json?callback=mycallback">
[22:12:09] <shoky> this in turn tells the browser to start fetching that script
[22:12:46] <shoky> when the JSONP-enabled server sees that "callback=mycallback"  in the query string, it knows to output the special javascript code, instead of just JSON
[22:13:11] <shoky> so the server responds with:   mycallback({...the JSON data...})
[22:13:27] <shoky> and jquery has already created such a callback
[22:13:46] <tw2113> let's get real here folks....the website code slips the remote server a few $$$'s and says "you know what to do", the server nods and goes "yup", disapears for a few ms, and returns with the goods, saying "here you go, don't come back for a few seconds"
[22:13:57] <shoky> which it pipes to the ajax success handler
[22:14:06] <shoky> which is where you see your data
[22:14:17] <tw2113> fiesty servers quote "callback me, maybe"
[22:14:42] <tw2113> but never respond without a callback, in all truth
[22:15:01] <shoky> never seen a more accurate description
[22:15:20] <tw2113> i should drink rum more often
[22:15:25] <meowcat> oh, so when you have the callback in the request it knows not to reply with JSON in javascript format so you browser can use it, otherwise it would just be serialzed text you would get back from the server?
[22:15:39] <shoky> meowcat yeah
[22:16:51] <meowcat> i mean it knows to reply in javascript format so the browser can use it, otherwise without the callback request it would be serialized text
[22:16:51] <shoky> meowcat but remember JSONP is just a hack
[22:17:29] <shoky> otherwise it would be just JSON, which is also proper javascript, but not actually code, just data
[22:17:50] <tw2113> mmm json carrys that data like a pro
[22:20:07] <unnu> $(this) is some bull$#!+
[22:20:21] <meowcat> shoky, so what would be a basic example of JSON and JSON with callback? JSON is just an object of data animals = {"cat:"meow"}
[22:20:25] <meowcat> what woud the call back look like?
[22:20:57] <shoky> meowcat: the server response you mean?   callbackname({"cat":"meow"})
[22:21:52] <meowcat> yea, so the callback just names the object?
[22:22:09] <shoky> hm?
[22:23:49] <meowcat> if my request was www.example.com/example.json?formatjson&callback=animals i would get back from example.com animals({"cat":"meow"})
[22:24:14] <shoky> yeap
[22:24:42] <meowcat> and if it was www.example.com/example.json?format=json i would get back {"cat":"meow"}
[22:25:28] <shoky> aye
[22:26:14] <shoky> but its not that "the callback just names the object"
[22:26:39] <shoky> it has to be the same callback name that was already set up for this request
[22:26:53] <shoky> jquery just puts random callback names
[22:27:10] <meowcat> which isnt useful because i cant really use that with javascript because it isnt an object? i could use animals.cat to get the value meow but with the request without the callback i would have to for loop it into an array which i could then use with jvascript?
[22:27:26] <shoky> nono
[22:27:38] <shoky> if it was just {"cat":"meow"}
[22:27:45] <shoky> you would have no way to access it
[22:28:02] <shoky> think if you just put a <script src="cat.json">
[22:28:14] <shoky> and the response is {"cat":"meow"}
[22:28:25] <shoky> that's not executable code, it does nothing, and the object is lost
[22:29:19] <shoky> and you'd get no notification when it arrived even
[22:30:20] <meowcat> so json is really used for server side applications and jsonp is used for the client manipulation
[22:30:52] <shoky> jsonp is used to get data from a site on a different domain
[22:31:24] <meowcat> i mean, jsonp with callback
[22:31:28] <shoky> by hacking it using a <script> to do the loading, becuase <script>s aren't restricted by SOP
[22:32:33] <meowcat> basically, the callback is so your browser can use the request because its in such a format javascript can access the data, but without the callback its just JSON data which isnt really useful
[22:32:48] <shoky> you have to differentiate between the 2 methods for loading the data.. one is with ajax, the other is with a <script> tag
[22:33:48] <shoky> the callback is only needed because you're loading it with a <script> tag and not with plain ajax
[22:34:01] <unnu> whats the best way to resize an ajax image
[22:34:02] <unnu> ??
[22:34:05] <shoky> <script> tags  load the code, then they execute it
[22:34:13] <shoky> if there's nothing to execute.. it's lost
[22:34:14] <unnu> ive got no event when the content updates to resize it on
[22:34:56] <unnu> i was using .each
[22:35:04] <meowcat> oh i seee, so <script> needs the callback and ajax uses json without the callback so you can parse the data how you please
[22:35:45] <shoky> meowcat: yeah. plain ajax doesn't execute the received data as javascript, it can do anything with it and you have control over it
[22:36:13] <shoky> with <script> you dont have any control over it, until it calls the callback
[22:36:18] <shoky> so the callback better be there
[22:36:23] <SeanJM> hi guys, I am creating an iframe from an HTTPS site and for some reason I can't get the contents of the iframe after it loads. I am using iframe.ready(function () { console.log(iframe.contents()[0]); });
[22:36:27] <SeanJM> and no dice
[22:36:36] <meowcat> if you see here at the loaFlickr() he has callback=? does that mean "no callback"
[22:36:37] <meowcat> http://www.copterlabs.com/blog/json-what-it-is-how-it-works-how-to-use-it/
[22:37:09] <meowcat> because the callback request is in the ajax code
[22:37:24] <unnu> nvm .load()
[22:37:28] <unnu> didn't know about that
[22:37:33] <shoky> meowcat: no, it means "replace this ? with some random callback name, and set up that callback so it can execute when the script is loaded"
[22:38:05] <shoky> meowcat: so when jquery sees "callback=?"  it replaces it with "callback=jQuery328472389572"  or whatever. and sets up a callback called jQuery328472389572
[22:38:30] <shoky> and then only sends the request (by adding the <script> tag )
[22:38:42] <meowcat> but you can see that it uses ajax and i thought you wouldnt want a callback when using ajax
[22:39:35] <shoky> meowcat: ah well that's a bit misleading i guess,  yeah you do it with the $.ajax calls even tho it might not be a real xmlhttprequest
[22:39:56] <shoky> that's mostly to keep the API's similar for both ways
[22:39:57] <SeanJM> Anyone get that problem?
[22:41:08] <shoky> meowcat: or i should've been saying xhr instead of ajax.. terminology getting in the way here
[22:41:25] <meowcat> well is you see here
[22:41:26] <meowcat> http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=29080075@N02&lang=en-us&format=json&jsoncallback=?
[22:41:41] <meowcat> it doesnt return a jquery object name
[22:41:52] <meowcat> but http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=29080075@N02&lang=en-us&format=json&jsoncallback=animal
[22:41:55] <meowcat> names the object animal
[22:42:04] <shoky> meowcat: the server should never see the ?
[22:42:20] <shoky> meowcat: the server should only see an actual callback name
[22:42:46] <meowcat> without the ? it names it jsonFlickrFeed
[22:43:29] <shoky> just a default name they're using i guess. you can do JSONP with a fixed callback name too if you want
[22:44:03] <meowcat> so without the callbackname in ajax i could use this.items to get the items
[22:44:08] <meowcat> but with the callback name i would have to use
[22:44:16] <meowcat> this.callback.items
[22:44:20] <meowcat> to get the items
[22:44:24] <shoky> wat
[22:44:45] <shoky> without the callback name you coudlnt do anything (if its a cross-domain request)
[22:45:21] <meowcat> http://pastie.org/7992111
[22:45:37] <meowcat> where it says success function(feed)
[22:46:03] <meowcat> i i used the "?" so no callback name was used then i could access the items by using feed.items
[22:46:24] <meowcat> but is i used callback=animals, i would have to use feed.animals.items
[22:46:26] <meowcat> right?
[22:53:34] <shoky> meowcat: jquery replaces the "?" with something else, so the ? would never get sent to the server
[22:53:40] <shoky> if you're doing it right, at least
[22:54:27] <meowcat> so jquery would gernate a random name for the request to be sent to the server
[22:54:28] <shoky> meowcat: but if for somereason the server doesnt put any callback name.. the <script> would be loaded with some JSON data in it, that you dont know about and can't access
[22:55:20] <unnu> yo shoky, you got a second?
[22:56:45] <shoky> unnu ye
[22:57:31] <unnu> this .select thing is giving me trouble
[22:57:52] <unnu> lemme finish writing it up in jsfiddle
[22:58:01] <unnu> imma have ju peak at it
[22:58:04] <unnu> naked if you will
[22:58:06] <unnu> ;)
[22:58:44] <shoky> way ahead of ya
[22:59:16] <unnu> whaaaa sun
[22:59:27] <unnu> aight
[22:59:29] <unnu> two things
[22:59:31] <unnu> first of
[22:59:35] <unnu> off*
[22:59:45] <SeanJM> anyone here have experience with iframes and jQuery?
[22:59:57] <meowcat> shoky: thanks, i think i get it, for the sake of ease, callback=? so that jquery can easily read the data, but if callback=animals then jquery would have to access a nested object though feed.animals.items which is no big deal, but it IS a big deal when it comes to using a <script> where you HAVE to have a callback otherwise you cant access your data
[23:00:23] <unnu> is there an easy way to switch back to spans or do i gotta just do it like in the edit function. secondly, how do i make catagory a <select> AND pull in the value, same way as the inputs don't work
[23:00:31] <unnu> lemme finish jsfiddle but yeah
[23:00:35] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/Jmr32/
[23:01:09] <shoky> meowcat: didn't understand this prt "but if callback=animals then jquery would have to access a nested object though feed.animals.items which is no big deal"
[23:01:22] <shoky> did that come out funky
[23:01:24] <shoky> sorry
[23:02:23] <Abhijit> hi. i have implemented div x axis drag using jquery event drag library. wheneven i click on div to drag it it displace itself away from mouse pointer and then starts dragging. ideally it should be exactly 'below' the mouse pointer! how can i solve this!
[23:02:26] <Abhijit> help please?
[23:02:59] <meowcat> the ajax success function is like this > success:function(feed). With the callback=? you can access the items by using "feed.items" but if you used ?callback=animals then you would have to use feed.animals.items to access the items
[23:03:27] <shoky> meowcat:  no
[23:03:48] <shoky> meowcat:  callback=? will become callback=jquery83472398
[23:03:59] <shoky> so there's no difference betwen jquery32789453728 and "animals"
[23:04:04] <shoky> just a different callback name
[23:04:30] <shoky> with either case,  feed.items should work fine
[23:04:33] <meowcat> so in both instances you would still use feed.items to acces the items?
[23:04:35] <meowcat> yea
[23:04:54] <shoky> feed.animals.item doesnt make any sense if that's not how the JSON is actually built..
[23:05:07] <shoky> callback name doesnt affect JSON structure
[23:05:09] <unnu> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/Jmr32/2/ looks cleaner
[23:06:37] <ankush> Hi I am using this plugin AjaxFileUpload, from phpletter.com, I need help in understanding when form gets submitted with target as an iframe, how should I accss the result from the iframe. In the plugin, its using load of the iframe.
[23:06:49] <ankush> but its confusing
[23:08:55] <ankush> meowcat: can you please help me with my query
[23:09:16] <unnu> ankush, why not FormData?
[23:09:25] <unnu> thing is easy as hell
[23:09:30] <unnu> some people hate it
[23:09:41] <unnu> but ive made 4 sites with it this week alone
[23:09:50] <unnu> (mostly because i learned it this week)
[23:10:52] <ankush> unnu: FormData -- it isnt fully implemented right?
[23:11:01] <shoky> unnu: didnt understand your first q, that works fine no?  for <selects> you can do the same thing more or less, using .val() on the <select> assuming the options have values
[23:11:35] <unnu> first q is, click edit post on one and then another. . .  they stay inputs . . . i dont like that . . .
[23:11:44] <unnu> and yeah, options have values
[23:11:50] <unnu> ill hammer this out
[23:11:55] <shoky> oh
[23:11:57] <unnu> just wanted to know if there was a super easy way to do it
[23:12:22] <unnu> ive learned in the last week the first way i do something in jquery is like reinventing the wheel every time
[23:12:36] <unnu> then you or cork or someone will be like
[23:12:41] <unnu> "theres a function for that"
[23:12:48] <unnu> lol
[23:13:47] <ankush> unnu: I need compatibity with all major browsers
[23:14:04] <unnu> sorry but ie 8 is not a major browser
[23:14:08] <unnu> . . . .
[23:14:34] <ankush> unnu: :) .. its not there in ie9 as well
[23:14:46] <unnu> let me rephrase t hat
[23:14:52] <unnu> IE is not a major browser*

[23:17:21] <ankush> unnu: sure 1 moment
[23:18:23] <unnu> man, i gotta work on my jokes, i can't make any of you guys laugh

[23:26:00] <unnu> look at line 105
[23:26:12] <unnu> to 124
[23:26:58] <ankush> yeah, so handleresponse is called when iframe is loaded, right?
[23:27:30] <unnu> looks like it
[23:27:42] <Abhijit> i have bar1 bar2 bar3 and so on div. how can i pass then in for loop in jq? how to write them? i have counter j. can i write bar+j

[23:30:07] <unnu> XD
[23:30:44] <unnu> lulz icyhot
[23:30:50] <ankush> anyways, my query is how does the plugin know that the result is loaded in the iframe, maybe the iframe gets loaded and the result isnt there yet?
[23:31:07] <unnu> .load()
[23:31:20] <unnu> shit i forget how to use this bot

[23:46:32] <beboo> Hello, all. Having some issues selecting an element, I believe. http://pastebin.com/SC3rkkfG - tried setting the value, detecting change and keypress, nothing seems to be working. Also tried selecting by input#searchDataBase and just #searchDataBase. Any ideas?
[23:50:12] <bambanx>  guys any extension addons or whatever for simulation of bandwidth on my browser on local?
[23:50:32] <Abhijit> how can i break $(".actbar").each(function() if if condition fails?
[23:50:33] <Abhijit> help
[23:50:48] <SeanJM> beboo: http://pastebin.com/RJFRanBr
[23:51:10] <Abhijit> i have $(".actbar").each(function() { if(cond) {do something} else {break;} });
[23:51:27] <Abhijit> how can i break that loop on if condition fail?
[23:51:39] <SeanJM> Abhijit: try this instead return false;
[23:52:16] <beboo> SeanJM, thanks for cleaning it up but it still isn't firing.
[23:52:22] <Abhijit> SeanJM, yeah. that worked. thanks.
[23:52:28] <SeanJM> beboo: try on jsfiddle instead
[23:52:34] <SeanJM> beboo: that way we can trouble shoot it together
[23:53:01] <beboo> I was working on that. jsfiddle doesn't seem to have a console - not sure it if just uses the browser's. Sec.
[23:53:20] <SeanJM> beboo: it uses the browser console, :-)
[23:54:18] <beboo> SeanJM, http://jsfiddle.net/gt4tE/ - query tab is the field I am trying to select.
[23:55:38] <Abhijit> SeanJM, .actbar is class and i have many of them. i am looping through them by doung $(".actbar").each(function() {}); but i can not access the current .actbar using "this". how can i use "this" ?
