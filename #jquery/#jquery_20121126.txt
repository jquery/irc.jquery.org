[00:00:28] <runvnc> that was when I realized it was too good to be true.  it was not an actual female person from china interested in getting to know me.  it was just someone trying to get money for signing up suckers on a dating site
[00:04:19] <MagePsycho> can you guys recommend good overlay plugin for jquery?
[00:04:43] <veQue> runvnc: you looking for love?
[00:05:10] <veQue> i reckon it cant be that hard to find someone in your neck of the woods
[00:05:53] <runvnc> no, just any female who is not ugly or fat to speak to me over the internet
[00:06:17] <runvnc> I am just gonna go on mfc.com.. they always answer when I say stuff.
[00:06:26] <runvnc> I do usually give them money too

[00:35:39] <motox> How can I check if a certain element of a json object exists? If it does not exist, this will error out:    if (typeof result.people[i][j] === 'undefined')
[00:39:11] <Danielss89> Is it possible to pick whole weeks with date picker, instead of single dates?
[01:08:41] <rahmen> Hi! I have a list of objects and want to find out if it contains a string. I've only found functions that has to match the whole value of an attribute and not parts of it. Anyone who knows a function that would solve this? I want to know if any attribute has this string in it.
[01:09:00] <rahmen> if it contains a certain string. Not any string :]
[01:12:42] <andrew9184> hmm is it a fixed attribute ?
[01:16:26] <rahmen> Doesn't matter which attribute it's in. I want to know if the object contains it
[01:17:09] <rahmen> I could do a json stringify and then use search() but then I'd search in the attribute keys as well which is not desired.
[01:26:27] <lazyfingers> hello. is anyone using jquery fullcalendar? if so, how one can get a cell's date? without using click event? thanks in advance.

[02:11:19] <DarkLobster> Is $(document).delegate('#fctool_wrap', 'keydown', this.fckeydown); bad when capturing key events? Seems this refuses to fire, for some reason, no matter where I click before pressing a key..
[02:15:24] <FishErr> Hi. I have changed example from jquerymobile.com: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html . I want create new page, not change existent: http://test.sandice.net/page/
[02:16:43] <FishErr> but my new page do not have header and it seems to me jquery mobile handlers do not applyed
[02:17:31] <FishErr> i have try tragger('create') at my new page, but do not help
[02:18:07] <FishErr> trigger*
[02:20:06] <FishErr> Maybe i do it wrong way? I first time create jquery mobile application.
[02:23:55] <DarkLobster> Dang.. It would be nice to delegate the keydown/press listener, as the page has some large tables on it. But I also *need* to filter events somehow as there are jquery ui tabs and the key should only be used when in one particular tab.
[02:25:56] <DarkLobster> Tried with a wrapper element from that tab that is as large as possible, but it doesn't seem to work. When I removed filtering on the other hand, null as filter to delegate(), the event handler reacted. But like I said, this should only happen when a particular tab is displayed..
[02:30:14] <DarkLobster> Anyone here who knows what I'm doing wrong?
[02:38:12] <DarkLobster> 822 idlers o_0??
[02:38:18] <ItsJustMe> yep ;D
[02:38:27] <ItsJustMe> okay 800 idlers and 22 idiots :D
[02:39:16] <FishErr> bot is idler or idiot? :)
[02:39:17] <DarkLobster> All quiet, though ={
[02:39:32] <ItsJustMe> bot is idler .. is not as dumb as me :'D
[02:40:02] <ItsJustMe> If I have several links: How can I manage, that the active one is green (background) and the other ones are grey? Or better: How can I reset all background values onclick and set the clicked one to green?
[02:45:30] <Hackwar> hi folks, I got a little problem with the orientationchange event. On this page http://www.test.studio-casa.de/clients/redaktionen the content is centered when loading or resizing the page. But when looking at the page with the iphone and turning the phone, it does not resize. Am I missing something here?
[03:00:37] <lazyfingers> hello. is anyone using jquery fullcalendar? if so, how one can get a cell's date? without using click event? thanks in advance.
[03:02:40] <jrockjiggz> lazyfingers: no, is there documentation?
[03:04:31] <lazyfingers> jrockjiggz, not a clue in documentation. i wouldn't ask if it'd be there
[03:06:33] <jrockjiggz> lazyfingers: ok
[03:08:37] <jrockjiggz> lazyfingers: you could retrieve data of an event with clientEvents
[03:08:38] <jrockjiggz> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_data/clientEvents/
[03:08:54] <jrockjiggz> hmm, thats not what you asked
[03:09:58] <jrockjiggz> or select http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/selection/select_method/
[03:12:21] <lazyfingers> jrockjiggz thanks though this isn't something that I need. I'm not using events because it needs to be shown on mobile devices. I get json data from a server and want to highlight certain day cells
[03:13:00] <lazyfingers> jrockjiggz the problem is that the only way I see, to get a day cell is via class or selectors looking for content
[03:13:53] <lazyfingers> there are classes that are telling if a day is from a not current month, it could be done but it looks like a raw and ugly hack. I'm surprised that original API doesn't support this
[03:14:44] <etisfo> Hello. How would I check if more then 4 checkboxes are checked, and if so, add a class to a div?
[03:14:54] <lazyfingers> I just want to highlight specific day cells
[03:15:53] <lazyfingers> etisfo $('.checkbox-class:checked').length >= 4
[03:16:37] <DarkLobster> This sucks.. I can't get a keydown event listener to trigger. Wouldn't the code for capturing keydowns in *one* of the jquery ui tabs be to attach to the topmost wrapper element, and then simply .on('keydown', handler_funcname) ?
[03:17:06] <etisfo> lazyfingers, and to add a class to a div if that's true? :)
[03:17:32] <ItsJustMe> I have got a general javascript question .. If you load a php document using ajax and in this document something fails, how can you react on that? I mean something like you click on a button, a php document is called, the doc checks some database value and if it fails it returns an error message. then you check if an error was given back and react like display a div or sth like that..
[03:17:36] <ItsJustMe> is that possible?
[03:18:03] <lazyfingers> etisfo as you like. it's just a hint how to address checked checkboxes
[03:19:34] <jrockjiggz> DarkLobster: keystrokes propagate throughout, in the topmost wrapper you can add e.stopPropagation(); .. that is if you can catch it there with your listener
[03:20:20] <DarkLobster> jrockjiggz: ..which I should be able to, unless something further down is stopping propagation. Right?
[03:22:34] <jrockjiggz> ItsJustMe: depends on your data, ajax error matches HTTP status codes, so if its not good (404) you can handle the error.. for your application, you can return in JSON something like 'error' : true, and in your success function if(json.error == true){ //cut to error message }
[03:23:15] <jrockjiggz> DarkLobster: i believe it will only catch keystrokes if it has focus, for global you can try binding to window
[03:23:18] <ItsJustMe> okay, so i have to spend some time on json ^^
[03:24:14] <jrockjiggz> ItsJustMe: theres no single answer, just whatever setup you are working with.. but JSON is a pretty solid low overhead standard
[03:25:57] <DarkLobster> jrockjiggz: Yes, I'm using document right now. But then I'll have to get the event target and climb the dom tree to check whether the target is part of my target jquery ui tab or not. Would that have been easier using that filtering, or would it..
[03:27:41] <DarkLobster> ..perhaps it would be better to enable/disable that key capturing depending on currently active tab.
[03:31:04] <jrockjiggz> DarkLobster: a hack is to bind a click to that tab, that sets data('clicked',true);  then, to see which element is active, loop through each tab and check if($(this).data('clicked') == true)
[03:31:20] <jrockjiggz> i'm not really sure your situation.. i'm sorry if i'm not helpful, just some ideas
[03:32:14] <DarkLobster> jrockjiggz: ;) Thanks :).
[03:33:23] <jrockjiggz> just make sure to reset to false when another one is clicked ;)
[03:57:11] <siovene> Hi. I have a <td> that contains an <a>. The <a> links to an external page, while the <td> has a .click() function bound to it. When I click the <a>, I can briefly see that the function I bound to my <td>'s .click() gets executed before the page is left.
[03:57:14] <siovene> How can I avoid that?
[03:58:00] <siovene> I don't think it's .stopPropagation(), because I don't want the event to fire at all, since I'm clicking on the <a> to open an external link.
[04:02:39] <jrockjiggz> siovene: on td, add $('a').stopPropagation
[04:03:44] <siovene> jrockjiggz: thanks, I'll try.
[04:03:58] <siovene> jrockjiggz: you mean on the td's click event?
[04:05:13] <siovene> no I guess you mean $('td a').click(function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); }); ?
[04:08:35] <siovene> It doesn't work, maybe I misunderstood.
[04:10:04] <jrockjiggz> no I mean in the td click event
[04:16:24] <siovene> jrockjiggz: oh alright, that worked. Thanks!
[04:21:16] <jrockjiggz> siovene: :D
[04:31:19] <roxlu_> hi jquery !
[04:32:29] <roxlu_> I'm using a html 4.01 doctype/strict and generating a <ul><li> with contents from a db. Each <li> must contain some custom data. Normally i misuse the "class" attribute, but I'm wondering what other solution are used?
[04:36:45] <xec_> roxlu_: how much does it matter to you that the html validates as html4 strict?
[04:37:09] <xec_> and/or why would you even use that doctype in 2012 ? :)
[04:40:13] <xdjuj> Is Colorbox always the best modal box ?
[04:40:45] <roxlu_> xec_: what's wrong with 4.01 strict?
[04:47:17] <jrockjiggz> roxlu_: the premis of HTML5 and not requiring a doctype is because browsers are well capable of dealing with incorrect attributes or unknown html elements.. the introduction of html5's new elements are backwards compatible with legacy browsers because it is compatible with their native behavior.. but if you want to use data attribute with HTML 4.01 strict, you'd probably want to change the
[04:47:17] <jrockjiggz> doctype to 'html' because your document is no longer HMTL 4.01 strict ;)
[04:48:03] <roxlu_> jrockjiggz: unless I use e.g. the "id" field to store custom data
[04:48:08] <roxlu_> (when possible of course)
[04:48:10] <jrockjiggz> data attribute with HTML 4.01 strict will work perfectly fine, but will not validate
[04:48:19] <roxlu_> yeah
[04:48:24] <roxlu_> ok thanks
[05:03:37] <sehh> hey people
[05:04:12] <sehh> q: is it possible to have alternate colors by row, in jquery's ui-menu widget?
[05:04:43] <sehh> in order to have odd or even rows with a different background color
[05:05:36] <Cork> sehh: sure, its just css
[05:05:59] <sehh> I tried to play around with CSS, but I couldn't find a good selector to do that
[05:06:09] <Cork> but there's no fallback code, or native support in the plugin
[05:06:30] <sehh> hmm
[05:06:40] <sehh> well, I can only see CSS classes like: ui-menu-item
[05:06:59] <sehh> but there is nothing like a ui-menu-item-odd/even
[05:07:06] <sehh> that I can use to match odd/even rows
[05:07:12] <Cork> sehh: .ui-menu-item:nth-child(odd) {}
[05:07:19] <sehh> oh :)
[05:07:24] <sehh> can it be that simple?
[05:07:36] <Cork> its just css child selectors
[05:07:38] <jrockjiggz> .ui-menu-item:nth-child(2n){}
[05:08:17] <sehh> wow, it worked perfectly!
[05:08:43] <sehh> I'm guessing its CSS3? so it probably won't work in older browsers, but thats a minor thing for me.
[05:08:50] <Cork> sehh: note though, it only works if fairly modern browsers
[05:09:05] <Cork> sehh: ya, older browsers like ie :)
[05:09:12] <sehh> no worries, its a minor thing and even if its not there, it won't cause problems
[05:09:21] <computer2000> pls help anyone: im using isotope.js and imagesloaded.js - now ive found out that imagesloaded.js is already included into isotope.js code, can i still use the imagesloaded.js functionality for things separate from isotope or cant i just delete the 'double' plugin?
[05:09:25] <sehh> ie? who uses ie these days...? :D
[05:09:30] <Cork> :)
[05:09:35] <sehh> Cork, thanks for the tip, much appreciated!
[05:10:14] <Cork> sehh: aprox 30% of the world ;)
[05:11:07] <sehh> I think those are the people who are not interested in "extra cool graphical effects", so they probably don't mind seeing a watered down site!
[05:11:26] <sehh> if they cared, they wouldn't use ie
[05:11:31] <Cork> ya
[05:11:35] <sehh> so no harm done..
[05:12:59] <Jungle_Jim> seen sethetter?

[05:23:03] <jrockjiggz2> ?repeat
[05:23:17] <jrockjiggz2> computer2000: i dont fully understand what your issue is
[05:23:18] <bot-t> jrockjiggz2, #11686 (Error during invocation of jQuery.css specifically using the ... - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11686
[05:24:10] <jrockjiggz> computer: try it and see

[05:25:18] <jrockjiggz> I don't know isotope.js, but you said its already included.. so loading a second time is redundant
[05:27:16] <tobago> i tried this on the jquery page, but it doesn't work:https://gist.github.com/4148187
[05:27:16] <tobago> any help would be appreciated

[05:29:20] <jrockjiggz> and this to $(this)
[05:33:06] <ItsJustMe> How can I set a live comma which is not added to value itself? Just like insert a little space between digits every 2/3 chars and show a comma-overlay or sth like that?
[05:34:13] <Cork> tobago: http://jsfiddle.net/WGTxj/
[05:34:44] <Cork> ItsJustMe: in what situation?
[05:35:39] <ItsJustMe> The user is asked to insert a price value .. just like 9,99 Ä .. but he shall type 999 and the comma needs to be insert to output, but not to value that is passed to php
[05:36:23] <jrockjiggz> ItsJustMe: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1990512/add-comma-to-numbers-every-three-digits-using-jquery
[05:36:51] <ItsJustMe> that's why i wrote live comma
[05:37:04] <Cork> ItsJustMe: you would have to either 1. add it and then remove it before submitting, or 2. have a separate field where it stores the none modified value
[05:37:15] <Cork> ItsJustMe: there's no way to have a "live" anything
[05:37:33] <ItsJustMe> i saw it already somewhere .. just don't know where =(
[05:37:41] <ItsJustMe> it's about years ago
[05:37:44] <Cork> html5 has a mask, but no browser support it yet as far as i know
[05:37:48] <tobago> Cork: thanks it works. :) well. why do i have to select the element twice (first time as a collection and second time the specific element)?
[05:38:03] <Cork> tobago: you don't
[05:38:13] <Cork> tobago: $() generates an array of dom elements
[05:38:20] <Cork> this is there for the dom element
[05:38:37] <Cork> $(this) wraps that single dom element in jquery with $(this)
[05:38:56] <Cork> tobago: the cost for doing $(this) is quite low
[05:39:51] <aqeel> hi room
[05:39:53] <tobago> Cork: o.k. i just thought it would be overhead.
[05:39:56] <Cork> tobago: through that said, for href you can just do this.href
[05:40:17] <Cork> (native dom accessor instead of going through jquery)
[05:40:18] <tobago> Cork: well. this didn't work in fuxxin IE6
[05:40:32] <Cork> this.href should work fine in ie6
[05:40:45] <tobago> mmh... i'll have to check once again then
[05:40:56] <tobago> Cork: but thank you very much!
[05:40:57] <tobago> :)
[05:41:03] <Cork> alert(this.href);
[05:41:06] <Cork> that is:)
[05:41:13] <Cork> console.log doesn't exist in ie6

[05:42:19] <anli> <=7, sorry
[05:42:26] <aqeel> why my code is not working
[05:43:04] <aqeel> ie use comments detection
[05:43:53] <aqeel> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537509%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
[05:45:32] <aqeel> anli ^^
[05:46:29] <aqeel> how come ar m works and var MCS not working
[05:46:38] <aqeel> var*
[05:47:06] <jrockjiggz> anli: this is what I use, it works for IE http://dpaste.org/U1IXX/
[05:48:01] <aqeel> i prefer not to use browser sniffing rather browser feature detection
[05:48:16] <jrockjiggz> ^^
[05:48:18] <aqeel> or use comments for ie
[05:50:59] <aqeel> guys why may var wil not work where as the other one works
[05:55:54] <shoky> aqeel: the code is fine.. that's not enough to help ya
[05:56:22] <aqeel> no imean if i var it it fails to work
[05:56:43] <shoky> that doesn't help me help you, does it
[05:56:51] <shoky> great, it fails to work.
[05:57:21] <aqeel> how come var M works and var MCS fails
[05:57:23] <shoky> maybe that MCS element isn't in the DOM when you're first calling menuhover()
[05:57:48] <aqeel> but how is that possible.....without var it works
[05:58:05] <shoky> or maybe you got the selector wrong, or maybe 100 other things. like i said, the code you showed is fine
[05:58:33] <shoky> it's possible if it isn't in the DOM to begin with, only after the mouseenter/mouseleave
[05:59:34] <aqeel> well it it gets added dynamically
[05:59:54] <shoky> you're not helping
[06:00:48] <shoky> var MCS = $("#" + menu + "menucontentstatus");  console.log(MCS.length, MCS)
[06:00:54] <shoky> use the console. see what's happening
[06:01:36] <aqeel> well i am making common stuff cached....making use of var as of now i have many repeated stuff.....let me put entire code...
[06:01:50] <shoky> wait wtf
[06:01:57] <fotoflo_> Êúâ‰∫∫Âú®Âåó‰∫¨ÂêóÔºü
[06:02:04] <shoky> the commented code has:  $("#"+menu+"menucontentstatus");.addClass("green");
[06:02:13] <shoky> that's bad syntax..
[06:02:29] <aqeel> sorry my bad...http://jsfiddle.net/wC3z2/1/
[06:03:13] <aqeel> my typo error...in comment.....copy pasted the line forgetting to remove the semi colon...
[06:03:48] <shoky> seeing more code doesnt help, it doesnt help me see if that element is in the DOM or not when you're declaring that var
[06:04:12] <shoky> if it's not in the DOM at that time, it makes sense that it doesn't work
[06:04:30] <shoky> now go console.log already
[06:04:43] <aqeel> ok let log now

[06:10:12] <diahane> nobody knows about?
[06:10:45] <shoky> ...?
[06:11:03] <diahane> i mean over 1milion people they stops framework?

[07:02:07] <atxq> when I open a new window, how can I call a function defined in the parent window?
[07:03:23] <atxq> $("#input",opener.window.document).val("New value"); works fine. Now I just need to figure out how to call a function defined in the parent window
[07:04:23] <Gho5t> functionName();
[07:05:07] <atxq> do you need to reference the parent window?
[07:08:56] <atxq> seems like I have to define the function outside jQuery for it to work properly.
[07:11:02] <Gho5t> a function defined on the window object is global by virtue
[07:11:41] <Gho5t> not sure what you mean by having to define it outside of jquery
[07:12:18] <atxq> was not working properly here in chrome if I defined the finction inside jQuery, so I moved the finction outside and it worked.
[07:12:59] <Gho5t> you mean outside of the callback?
[07:13:24] <Gho5t> kinda confusing that you're saying "defined inside jquery"
[07:13:26] <Gho5t> jquery is a library
[07:13:30] <Gho5t> anywho
[07:13:33] <Gho5t> one thing you'
[07:13:39] <Gho5t> re probably tripping up on
[07:13:45] <Gho5t> is that javascript has function scope
[07:13:47] <Gho5t> not block scope
[07:14:23] <Gho5t> so if you define a function within another function only functions that are also defined in that same function will be able to see it
[07:14:33] <Gho5t> so you did it right
[07:14:39] <atxq> I meant jQuery scope
[07:14:53] <xec_> functionception!
[07:14:55] <Gho5t> that still makes no sense
[07:15:00] <codecowboy> hi. can anyone confirm if this code snippet is creating touch events and adding them to jquery? https://gist.github.com/930bc0ceeffe38f785dc
[07:15:13] <Gho5t> do you just throw out words you learned in CS and hope they stick
[07:15:35] <xec_> atxq: you started out by saying "when i open a new window" - do you mean like a new tab?
[07:15:50] <atxq> no, an new popup window
[07:18:21] <xec_> atxq: i believe that would be a separate page - with the exception of local storage and cookies and such, you don't have access to the environment in the page you called the window.open() from
[07:18:34] <xec_> unless i'm mistaken, of course :P
[07:18:38] <atxq> basic if I define a javascript functin inside jQuery's "read"y method, than I cannot access the function from a child window.
[07:19:13] <atxq> so after moving to js function outside of the ready method, it seemed to work fine
[07:19:16] <xec_> that makes sense - you can't access it from the main window either, can you
[07:19:30] <xec_> atxq: "window" being the global object
[07:20:53] <xec_> atxq: is the "new window" the same page? like, are you including the same script there?
[07:21:17] <aqeel> atxq: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2167455/how-to-access-parent-window-object-using-jquery
[07:21:21] <atxq> no
[07:22:12] <atxq> thanks guys. I got it working now using opener.window.funcName();
[07:22:33] <aqeel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4667714/refresh-parent-window-from-child-window-using-javascript.............instead of refresh how about callback

[07:33:19] <bananaboydean> Im trying to post a JSON variable and I cant seem to do it
[07:33:26] <bananaboydean> heres my code
[07:33:35] <moura> i have an animated box but while moving around it doesn't assume the click method. any solutions?
[07:34:28] <bananaboydean> if(allClear) { $.post($(document.myform).attr("POST"), registerJSON, function(data) {window.location.href = "index.html";});
[07:35:14] <nerk> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/popup-panels.html <-- is it possible to make this work in a multi-page jquery.mobile setup?
[07:35:16] <itatitat> guys Im having a very strange behaviour in Jquery, the code is very simple, but I don't figure out what's happening http://jsfiddle.net/62skk/1/
[07:35:20] <itatitat> in the same code I explain what's the problem
[07:35:42] <nerk> I have two views .. with menu panels and different ids.  but when I transition from one view to the next.. the menu panel doesn't work on the newxt view.
[07:35:49] <nerk> if I refresh that view, it does work.
[07:36:06] <nerk> there are no errors :/
[07:36:33] <analphabet> is it possible to set a target position when triggering a click event on an element?
[07:36:58] <warden23> G'day.. am I doing something wrong? I'm trying to replace a height by the following: $("li#login.active").css("92px", newheight);
[07:37:19] <BillCriswell> moura: I can't replicate that. Do you have some code we can look at? Preferably in jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net
[07:37:30] <NoiseEee> yes, nowhere are you indicating that you want to do anything with height warden23
[07:37:38] <NoiseEee> warden23: the old height is irrelevent
[07:37:54] <warden23> that code I just listed doesn't replace it though :\
[07:38:07] <moura> BillCriswell sure 1min
[07:38:23] <NoiseEee> warden23: right, you don't want to replace it.  you want to set the height.
[07:38:23] <NoiseEee> warden23: and nowhere in your code is a mention of height
[07:38:30] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/css/ @ warden23
[07:38:38] <warden23> yeah isn't 92px the header
[07:38:40] <warden23> i mean height
[07:39:05] <warden23> ok thanks NoiseEe
[07:39:51] <kreature> Is it possible in jquery mobile to create a modal window like the on the right in this picture? http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/4.19_Walmart1.jpg
[07:40:00] <warden23> but then i have another problem because .css seems whipe out all .css currently styled on the element?
[07:40:09] <kreature> I want to create a popup which shows a list of countries and the user can scroll throught them
[07:40:25] <moura> BillCriswell here http://jsfiddle.net/sTDqh/ its s bit buggy buts thats ok i just want it to assume the clicking while moving around
[07:40:29] <kreature> I want it contained within in the popup and not make a long list downwards
[07:40:31] <warden23> I only want to add height to the css that is already in the .css sheet
[07:41:19] <BillCriswell> bananaboydean: $.post( url, data, function(result){ result.foo }); is what you need. I'm thinking you want something more like $.post( $('form[name=myform]').attr('action'), registerJSON, function(data){ data.someVar });
[07:41:31] <warden23> nice moura
[07:41:35] <warden23> cept for the stop doesn't work heehee
[07:42:17] <mazzachre> css('right') is not supposed to give me the computed value, right?
[07:42:19] <BillCriswell> moura: It's not moving at all here.
[07:42:41] <bananaboydean> BillCriswell: I dont exactly know the difference in our code im fairly new to JQuery
[07:44:27] <BillCriswell> moura: http://jsbin.com/alojif/1/edit This is what I came up with to see if it would work and it did.
[07:46:14] <BillCriswell> bananaboydean: You're trying to get a value for a "post" attribute on your form.
[07:46:15] <nerk> do popups only work off of IDs?
[07:46:20] <nerk> in jquery mobile?
[07:46:36] <nerk> this seems to be creating an issue with ajax transitions and popups failing after a page transition.
[07:47:00] <BillCriswell> bananaboydean: "post" would be a value of the method attribute typically.
[07:48:01] <bananaboydean> BillCriswell: thanks man ill try it out!
[07:50:11] <moura> bill http://jsbin.com/alojif/2/  -> here when its faster doest assume all the clicks
[07:51:19] <BillCriswell> moura: I can still get it, just a giant pain in the ass.
[07:52:31] <moura> this is for a mini shooting game where i will have the target moving around but when i increase the speed doesn't assume the click i don't know why maybe cause the speed OR the browser lol
[07:53:08] <BillCriswell> moura: What about mousedown instead?
[07:53:32] <moura> i will try, thanks :D¬¥
[07:55:42] <BillCriswell> moura: No problem!
[07:58:19] <nerk> anyone able to shed light as to why popups don't work after a page transition in jquery mobile?
[08:00:07] <nerk> hrrm..
[08:03:01] <warden23> Hello, I'm REALLY stumped on how to even tackle this.. could someone please help :D I've setup the html and css to help explain what I mean: http://jsfiddle.net/aya9Z/ I want it so if the link has the same word as the h2 then the link turns into a span like the other in the example and ads an additional class.. is this possible?
[08:04:50] <warden23> adds*
[08:05:04] <Snane> hmmm
[08:05:16] <warden23> Is it possible?
[08:05:24] <Snane> im kind of stumped too
[08:05:44] <Snane> hopefully someone else sees that
[08:05:51] <warden23> np we'll start a forrest
[08:06:04] <jrockjiggz> warden23: http://jsfiddle.net/aya9Z/1/

[08:06:31] <Snane> js..
[08:06:38] <warden23> champ jrockjiggz
[08:06:40] <jrockjiggz> change replace to before
[08:06:42] <jrockjiggz> :)
[08:06:44] <jrockjiggz> glad to help
[08:06:53] <warden23> argh it didnt add the other class
[08:07:09] <nerk> anyone here ever build a multipage jquery mobile site using popups?
[08:07:14] <warden23> trying to make it also once it turns into a span
[08:07:24] <warden23> it's two classes are: cf_option cf_disabled_opt
[08:07:33] <warden23> if that makes sense
[08:08:25] <ItsJustMe> Hey there :)

[09:06:18] <b1lly> What is the difference between .bind(), .live(), and .delegate()?
[09:06:38] <nerk> don't forget on() :/
[09:06:58] <b1lly> and on
[09:10:47] <Cork> b1lly: bind binds the event on the element matching the selector in $()
[09:11:17] <Cork> b1lly: delegate binds an event on the matching selector but for another element matching a selector you give to delegate
[09:11:29] <Cork> b1lly: .live is a depricated form of delegate
[09:11:39] <Cork> b1lly: and .on is a shorthand for all of them
[09:12:20] <b1lly> that all makes sense
[09:12:29] <b1lly> but alitle confused with .delegate() ?
[09:12:36] <Cork> ?.delegate
[09:12:37] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[09:12:47] <b1lly> what do you mean binds an event on the matching slector for another elemnt
[09:13:06] <Cork> $('parent').delegate('.clickable-class', 'click', function() {});
[09:13:26] <NoiseEee> don't use delegate
[09:13:38] <NoiseEee> you just said 'on' is a shorthand for all of them; provide an example with .on
[09:13:39] <Cork> NoiseEee: theres no problem with using delegate
[09:13:44] <Cork> its the same thing as on
[09:13:56] <Cork> live is the one thats deprecated
[09:14:03] <NoiseEee> first sentence is "As of jQuery 1.7,¬†.delegate()¬†has been superseded by the¬†.on()¬†method."
[09:14:08] <NoiseEee> so please, use .on
[09:14:30] <b1lly> so use live
[09:14:31] <b1lly> instead of on
[09:14:34] <Cork> but it still does the exact same thing, and theres no extra cost to it
[09:14:35] <b1lly> err delegate
[09:14:37] <b1lly> or on instead of both
[09:14:55] <Cork> on switch the place of the selector and the event thats the only difference
[09:15:09] <NoiseEee> Cork: but the manual is asking you to use .on(), and it gives you access to useful things like .ofF()
[09:15:24] <Cork> $('parent').on('click', '.clickable-class', function() {});
[09:15:27] <NoiseEee> i mean, do what you want but best practice for jquery in this channel is to use .on() over delegate and live
[09:15:56] <Cork> NoiseEee: theres undelegate, and it does the same thing
[09:16:14] <Cork> sure, on is the new prefered ui, but theres no problem with using either one
[09:16:34] <Cork> delegate has the upperhand of having better backwards support
[09:17:17] <Cork> (delegate works in 1.4 while .on works in 1.7)
[09:17:34] <warden23> Hi, is there anything in this script that would conflict with another script.. or do I need to add anything? http://jsfiddle.net/aya9Z/6/ because it runs fine in JSFiddle but as soon as I place it with other scripts on my site it doesn't work :(
[09:18:03] <warden23> I've tried it with ( jQuery.noConflict() );

[09:18:18] <Cork> lol
[09:18:56] <nerk> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/popup-panels.html <-- anyone know of a way to make this work in a single page template when you ajax transition from one view to another that has this implemented?
[09:18:57] <Cork> warden23: that depends on what the other code does
[09:19:26] <Cork> warden23: you could try http://jsfiddle.net/aya9Z/7/
[09:19:44] <Cork> if that doesn't help the other code is needed to tell
[09:25:39] <warden23> Cork i think you may be a champion! brb
[09:27:53] <r3v3rb> hi all, I'm trying to get jquery validation working with a dynamic form element that uses php's [] notation is it possible to re-link the form elements to get the newly added ones on blur/change?

[09:33:16] <warden23> Cork *
[09:36:10] <warden23> To finish this up nicely would be: http://jsfiddle.net/aya9Z/8/ see how I have Bridal and bridal, hence why it won't work unless both Bridal, Bridal with first letter caps.. is there anyway to make jquery either skip the first letter or accept both capitals and lowercase?
[09:40:48] <warden23> Is it even possible?
[09:40:52] <danzik17> warden23: if case doesn't matter to you, you could just call .toLowerCase() in your comparison - http://jsfiddle.net/aya9Z/9/
[09:41:34] <nerk> any jquery mobile coders here?

[09:46:04] <Brainix> Greetings.  Is this the right channel to ask some advice on jQuery plugins?
[09:50:25] <jacobroufa_> ?ask Brainix
[09:50:27] <bot-t> jacobroufa_, Couldn't find "ask Brainix" in jQuery Docs.
[09:50:31] <jacobroufa_> ?ask
[09:50:32] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:50:38] <jacobroufa_> Brainix ^^
[09:51:27] <dwok> Does every HTML element have a 'click' event? i.e. <h2>?
[09:51:51] <Brainix> jacobroufa_: Cool, thanks.
[09:51:59] <Brainix> I'm looking for a jQuery plugin to detect mobile browser events (like swipe, etc.).  I've Googled and found several plugins.  Does anyone here have a favorite plugin?
[09:59:04] <ItsJustMe> aqeel still here? o.√¥
[09:59:35] <dwok> Is it possible to capture a "click()" event on an element other than an anchor tag? For example a header tag "<h2>"?
[10:00:24] <ItsJustMe> dwok, it is .. as far as i know .. i use it for a div
[10:00:51] <dwok> ItsJustMe: Thanks a bunch
[10:01:41] <Brainix> dwok: Yeah - I use a click event handler on all kinds of elements, not just anchors and buttons.  :-P
[10:02:02] <dwok> Brainix: Thank you
[10:02:19] <Brainix> dwok: No problem.
[10:04:29] <r3v3rb> can anyone tell me whether its possible validate a dynamically added fieldset using [] notation for the field names? or do I definately need to add indexing to the [ ] ?
[10:04:36] <dwok> I have a DIV tag with the ID "MyDIV". I want to capture the on click event of an <H2> element that is a distant child of the DIV. I thought this selector would work. $('#mg-menu-strategy-and_architecture > h2').click(.....
[10:04:57] <dwok> I have a DIV tag with the ID "MyDIV". I want to capture the on click event of an <H2> element that is a distant child of the DIV. I thought this selector would work. $('#MyDIV > h2').click(‚Ä¶..

[10:07:18] <NoiseEee> dwok: $('#MyDIV').on('click','h2',function(){})
[10:07:19] <NoiseEee> ^^
[10:07:44] <dwok> NoiseEee: Thank you. I have never seen the "on" attribute
[10:07:53] <NoiseEee> 1.7+
[10:08:04] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/on/ @ dwok
[10:10:51] <dwok> NoiseEee: I just looked it up. Does it provide an advantage over a standard filter? Like the one I used?
[10:11:15] <NoiseEee> its event delegation.
[10:11:45] <NoiseEee> your entire div has a click listener on it, but only fires when the element clicked is an h2
[10:12:41] <dwok> NoiseEee: Thanks .. I see your point
[10:13:17] <andrew9184> when developing jquery plugins, how do I determine whether to put functions inside Plugin.prototype.init or outside ?
[10:13:30] <wachpwnski> When you make an ajax request
[10:13:46] <wachpwnski> how can you output the error ?
[10:14:08] <JessC> @andrew9184 http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#jquerypluginpatterns
[10:14:22] <andrew9184> yeah I read that, but still wasn't sure where to put them
[10:15:23] <JessC> @wachpwnski You can attach a .fail function to the request which passes an xhr function and then you can do what you'd like to display that error
[10:16:00] <wachpwnski> can I do something like error: function(data, msg) { alert(msg); }
[10:16:02] <wachpwnski> something like that?
[10:16:20] <JessC> @andrew9184 it would depend on what your plugin did, if it performaned a single option on the element or there were extra options that you wanted to make it available
[10:17:21] <dwok> How do debug jQuery? Is there a tool that will tell you if certain events have fired? I use Firebug to view the HTML and get class names and such.
[10:17:22] <JessC> @wachpwnski yes but the first parameter is the xhr object so if you just alerted that you'd get a huge alertbox with all the object properties, you could do data.responseText to only show the message sent from the server
[10:20:15] <tapmodo> dwok: with firebug and in webkit browsers, try using console.log(); and debugger; within your code, or add breakpoints and learn how to use firebug's debugger
[10:20:15] <wachpwnski> it says you can do this: complete(jqXHR, textStatus)
[10:20:22] <wachpwnski> let me tinker with it
[10:20:50] <dwok> tapmodo: Thanks for the tip
[10:21:12] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ dwok
[10:22:19] <JessC> @wachpwnski yes you can do that but the preferred method is to use a deferred object success, done, fail, always
[10:22:43] <dwok> NoiseEee: Awesome resource! Thanks a lot!
[10:30:21] <Aero`> Hi guys ! Anyone here using wysihtml5 WYSIWYG editor ? I got some trouble with it, using it in a form.
[10:31:58] <wachpwnski> JessC, why do they offer the success and complete stuff then?
[10:32:18] <vacho> guys,,
[10:32:47] <vacho> I am building my next app with twitter bootstrap and I am wondering where I can find a good base to start with that includes bootstrap and boilerplate? It needs to be 980width
[10:32:56] <JessC> @wachpwnski those have been there since jquery started supporting ajax, deferred object was introduce in 1.8.x
[10:38:23] <Teduardo> does anyone know what I am doing wrong in this super simple code? http://jsfiddle.net/C4zRm/
[10:39:19] <dwok> Is there a $(this).child() function similar to $(this).parent()?
[10:39:38] <filipiz> dwok: $(this).children()
[10:40:00] <filipiz> will return all the children of "this"
[10:40:02] <dwok> filipiz: Thanks! This syntax is killing me
[10:41:22] <nerk> Teduardo: your selector is broken
[10:41:32] <nerk> you dont  have a class of state you have an id of state
[10:41:34] <nerk> select#state
[10:41:44] <nerk> or select[name=state]
[10:42:46] <nerk> so crap, the menu panel works fine in my test case.. I must have code of my own that is breaking things.. meh :/
[10:43:02] <JFranks> If I want the 'value' of : <input type="number" id="foo">  .. I could do getElementById.. but how does jQuery tackle it?
[10:43:21] <Teduardo> nerk, I changed it now to just be select.state and oddly enough it still doesn't work
[10:44:35] <JFranks> Right.. Clearly document.getElementById('#foo').value .. is the best way. Thanks!
[10:44:59] <NoiseEee> o.O
[10:45:55] <nerk> Teduardo: you don't have a class of state
[10:46:06] <nerk> so that is the exact code you had previously.. that won't work still.
[10:46:18] <nerk> either select#state or select[name=state]
[10:49:12] <dwok> Should single quotes or double quotes be used with jQuery?
[10:49:15] <dwok> I see both used
[10:49:24] <brend_> same thing
[10:52:31] <filipiz> dwok: it doesn't meters if single or double quoted..
[10:52:35] <filipiz> matters*
[10:52:44] <dwok> OK thanks
[10:55:45] <filipiz> ? children

[11:08:20] <dwok> Does this statement look correct? $(this).children().find('ul').toggle();
[11:08:27] <dwok> Because its not working
[11:08:49] <andrew9184> we need to know the whole story before we can tell you why its not working
[11:09:10] <dwok> I know I have the parent selected properly because I tested with using an alert("hello")
[11:09:16] <skyjumper> what's a good way to do this: $("bunch_of_checkboxes").indexOfFirstMatch(':checked')
[11:09:28] <brend_> dwok:  what are u trying to do?
[11:10:03] <dwok> Trying to "hide" a list <ul> when clicking a certain parent element
[11:10:03] <Kataki> dwok, pasting your code completely on jsfiddle.net
[11:10:14] <dwok> will do ‚Ä¶ thanks
[11:10:32] <NoiseEee> also, $(this).children('ul')
[11:11:11] <brend_> i would do something like this $("ul",this).toggle('slow');
[11:11:17] <andrew9184> my jquery plugin code is smelly, but it takes too long to make clean
[11:12:20] <BillCriswell> dwok: If you're only going one level deep NoiseEee's .children() solution works, .find() if you need to go further.
[11:12:29] <skyjumper> bah
[11:12:52] <tapmodo> dwok: .find() will work on the .children()... not sure if that step is necessary...
[11:13:24] <dwok> Only problem is the <ul> is deep inside after the <h2>
[11:13:42] <BillCriswell> dwok: Then you want .find('ul')
[11:13:42] <NoiseEee> dwok: then just dump the children() entirely
[11:14:15] <dwok> NoiseEee: could you elaborate on what you mean by "dump". Do you mean write to the console?
[11:14:22] <NoiseEee> i mean drop it from your JS
[11:14:38] <dwok> I see
[11:14:39] <NoiseEee> $(this).find('ul').toggle() @ dwok
[11:14:44] <dwok> trying now
[11:15:07] <BillCriswell> skyjumper: The index like... in relation to all the non checked ones?
[11:15:28] <skyjumper> BillCriswell: yeah. this is the best i've found: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5395537/jquery-how-to-get-the-index-of-a-checked-radio-button
[11:15:33] <skyjumper> not as clean as it could be
[11:16:36] <BillCriswell> skyjumper: Depending on the markup you can maybe do $(':input:checked').eq(0).prevAll().length
[11:17:10] <BillCriswell> prevAll(':input')
[11:17:21] <skyjumper> hrm
[11:18:08] <dwok> Here is my jsfiddle mockup ‚Ä¶ http://jsfiddle.net/9LXEy/
[11:18:39] <skyjumper> BillCriswell: that is a cool idea, won't work with this markup though
[11:18:46] <NoiseEee> dwok: your uls are not children of the h2
[11:18:50] <NoiseEee> dwok: they are siblings
[11:19:10] <dwok> wouldn't just find work?
[11:19:19] <tapmodo> dwok: only finds under
[11:19:35] <dwok> I see
[11:19:50] <tapmodo> so if you add a .parent() before your find...
[11:19:50] <dwok> How do I find one that is "after" but not a child
[11:19:55] <dwok> not under
[11:20:39] <tapmodo> you could traverse and select it many different ways... depends on your case
[11:21:43] <dwok> I just tried siblings() and it worked!!
[11:22:00] <dwok> so find() only finds "children"?
[11:22:06] <BillCriswell> dwok: You want .next('ul')
[11:22:12] <NoiseEee> what BillCriswell just said
[11:22:17] <dwok> BillCriswell: That makes sense
[11:22:23] <andrew9184> if i'm making a VCR plugin, would I define all the start, stop, record, seek functions within the Plugin.prototype.init ?
[11:22:24] <dwok> Thanks solo Much!
[11:22:38] <dwok> I meant .. Thanks soooo much!
[11:22:39] <BillCriswell> skyjumper: If I could see the HTML I might be able to come up with something?
[11:22:48] <BillCriswell> Trying to think of a way that the HTML wouldn't matter.
[11:23:32] <skyjumper> BillCriswell: nah, i'll just do it a slightly more complex way
[11:24:02] <BillCriswell> dwok: No problem!
[11:24:20] <BillCriswell> skyjumper: OKie dokie.
[11:27:18] <andrew9184> is there anything against naming the passing variables the same as the parameters when declaring a function?
[11:27:44] <andrew9184> well, i guess in that case, i wouldn't need a variable, right ?
[11:27:54] <shoky> "passing variables"?
[11:28:57] <andrew9184> like i did, playvideo(movie_title)
[11:29:10] <andrew9184> and then in the function declaration i did, function playvideo(movie_title)
[11:29:20] <shoky> if it makes sense, then it's good
[11:29:25] <ismell> ello
[11:29:59] <ismell> oops
[11:30:33] <ismell> fyi, on the jquery-ui homepage the Stable link is broken
[11:31:08] <andrew9184> hmm okay, sometimes things dont make sense but i do it anyways for clarity
[11:31:37] <dwok> If I wanted to select a <ul class="myclass"> would the proper selector be $('ul.myclass')
[11:31:58] <shoky> dwok: that'd work
[11:32:14] <dwok> OK .. thanks
[11:32:37] <DrunkY> can anyon share simple examples for image animation - slider like?:)
[11:36:22] <Gho5t> if my event is being triggered by this:  $element.trigger("swipeDown", [event, direction, distance, duration]); wouldn't I be able to access distance by doing using the arguments array?
[11:37:48] <Gho5t> nvm I should try reading the api
[11:41:39] <halcyon1234> jqm: Can I specify a custom function to determine when an autodivider should be inserted? Now it's "by first letter of text", but I want to do "By date", for example.
[11:42:20] <dwok> Having problem selecting <ul> that is nested inside a DIV which is a sibling of the H2 element .. http://jsfiddle.net/9LXEy/
[11:44:06] <shoky> dwok: .find() looks for descendants
[11:44:21] <dwok> Sorry .. just updated with "next()"
[11:44:21] <shoky> dwok: you want .next('ul')
[11:44:37] <dwok> next didn't work either
[11:44:39] <NoiseEee> dwok: didnt we just go over this?
[11:44:45] <shoky> dwok: and choose jquery on the left..
[11:45:00] <dwok> NoiseEee: Yes, however the <UL> was contained inside a DIV
[11:45:20] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/9LXEy/3/ @ dwok
[11:46:07] <dwok> NoiseEee: Thanks again. I guess I have got something else wrong. Thanks for the help though
[11:46:54] <awc7371> I have an array like this: [{"id":"4","title":"Builders Aluminum Windows","col_id":"1.3.3",
[11:47:04] <awc7371> but for some reason, this does not return true: if ($.inArray("1.3.3", collections) !== -1) {	alert('found');	}
[11:47:19] <NoiseEee> awc7371: that first item in your array?  an object.
[11:47:26] <shoky> awc7371:  "1.3.3" is not a member of the array
[11:47:41] <awc7371> is col_id a memeber?
[11:47:44] <awc7371> member*
[11:47:49] <awc7371> I thought it would return any key or value
[11:47:50] <shoky> its the value of the col_id field of the first item in the array..
[11:48:07] <shoky> col_id isn't a member of the array either
[11:48:09] <awc7371> at least here they are returning both "John" and 4
[11:48:10] <awc7371> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[11:48:16] <NoiseEee> awc7371: you have an object.
[11:48:35] <awc7371> can I say inArray on that object?
[11:48:40] <awc7371> so like collections[1]
[11:48:42] <NoiseEee> no, because an object is not an array.
[11:48:54] <awc7371> oh I need to convert to array i guess
[11:48:57] <shoky> collections[0].col_id maybe...
[11:49:32] <shoky> forget about inArray, most likely wont help you here
[11:49:42] <awc7371> hmm
[11:49:45] <awc7371> unless I convert it
[11:49:51] <awc7371> in PHP I
[11:49:55] <NoiseEee> arrays have numerical indices in javascript
[11:49:57] <NoiseEee> this is not php
[11:49:58] <awc7371> I'm json encoding the array
[11:50:04] <shoky> eh.
[11:50:10] <awc7371> but I could do var collections = <?php echo $this->collections ?>
[11:50:12] <awc7371> without json encoding
[11:50:15] <shoky> arrays and objects are different for a reason :\
[11:50:19] <awc7371> would that still leave it as an object and not array?A
[11:50:20] <dwok> I think the problem I am having is that the <ul> I am trying to select is the second or third <ul> sibling. I tried selecting it by using it's class name but that didn't work‚Ä¶ see this JSFiddle ‚Ä¶ http://jsfiddle.net/9LXEy/7/
[11:51:06] <shoky> dwok: .next() looks only at the directly next element
[11:51:12] <NoiseEee> dwok: next is for literally the next element. in that case, you would want .siblings
[11:51:18] <shoky> or .nextAll
[11:51:36] <awc7371> oh, i should probably iterate the PHP array and make it a Javascript array, instead of assigning it as one variable
[11:51:49] <dwok> NoiseEee: I see ‚Ä¶ so next() just looks for next sibling .. filter or no filter
[11:51:54] <NoiseEee> awc7371: no, you should just learn how to deal with objects
[11:52:03] <shoky> awc7371: maybe you should keep the php the same but look for the value in the proper way, and not with inArray
[11:52:20] <awc7371> is there something efficient like inArray for objects?
[11:52:28] <shoky> inArray isn't efficient
[11:52:28] <awc7371> I thought it was more efficient then looping the entire thing
[11:52:40] <awc7371> oh
[11:52:46] <shoky> it's a linear search
[11:53:09] <awc7371> ok ill just loop the object, thanks
[11:53:16] <shoky> ;S
[11:53:21] <shoky> you know the field name already, why not use it?
[11:53:24] <shoky> col_id :\
[11:53:42] <awc7371> yeah ill still need to loop
[11:53:53] <shoky> as you wish
[11:57:38] <BillCriswell> "Button Optimizer Script"... What have I done to deserve this?
[11:57:59] <shoky> :-o
[11:58:07] <NoiseEee> optimized too few buttons
[12:01:22] <dwok> How do you select for an element that is a child of a sibling ‚Ä¶ http://jsfiddle.net/9LXEy/11/
[12:02:29] <Gho5t> $(this).siblings().find('ul.menu2').toggle();
[12:02:42] <Gho5t> or just $('ul.menu2').toggle();
[12:03:31] <NoiseEee> dwok: indeed, Gho5t has a point.  why are you bothering with selectors if you know the element/class you want?
[12:04:11] <dwok> NoiseEee: Because it is not the only <ul> on the page that has that element and class.
[12:04:32] <NoiseEee> ok
[12:04:38] <dwok> I have a group of menus <ul> that I want to toggle visibility on
[12:05:09] <dwok> Each menu has a unique <h2> so that was my starting point
[12:06:10] <dwok> Clearly I need to understand how to traverse the DOM much better with jQuery. Can anyone suggest a resource or book that they feel is good for this purpose?
[12:06:22] <NoiseEee> !learn @ dwok
[12:06:22] <b-ot> dwok, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[12:06:54] <dwok> b-ot: I am familiar with JavaScript .. it is more just learning the various selectors of jQuery
[12:07:21] <dwok> Opps .. I spoke to a bot
[12:08:01] <BillCriswell> dwok: You would use next('ul').find('foo')
[12:08:19] <dwok> Thanks so much everyone for your patience and your help. I have learned a lot today.
[12:09:04] <dwok> BillCriswell: So next would find the next occurrence of <ul> but what would find() do?
[12:09:19] <BillCriswell> You said you want to find the child of a sibling.
[12:10:07] <BillCriswell> .next('ul') returns the sibling unordered list and .find('li') returns the children list items
[12:10:50] <BillCriswell> ... returns the *next* sibling...
[12:11:10] <dwok> BillCriswell: Thanks
[12:11:15] <Teduardo> how can you use a variable in replaceWith() ?
[12:11:31] <Teduardo> i tried just replaceWith(var) and replaceWith('var')
[12:11:31] <NoiseEee> var p = $)
[12:11:58] <NoiseEee> var p = $('<p>').text('i replaced something');  $('someSelector').replaceWith(p)
[12:12:31] <BillCriswell> Teduardo: That should work just fine.
[12:12:41] <BillCriswell> dwok: No problems.
[12:13:20] <BillCriswell> replaceWith('var') would work too.... just probably not what you expect.
[12:14:22] <BillCriswell> Teduardo: http://jsfiddle.net/4AazD/
[12:19:05] <Teduardo> this is the code i'm using, can you give me some advice? http://jsfiddle.net/C4zRm/5/
[12:19:14] <veQue> can i get jquery mobile to work in jsfiddle?
[12:20:17] <nerk> Tedurado: bad selectors again
[12:20:24] <nerk> .item is a class
[12:20:26] <BillCriswell> Teduardo: I see div.fmd, but no <div class="fmd"></div>
[12:20:28] <nerk> #item is an ID
[12:20:36] <Teduardo> ack
[12:21:00] <veQue> i i guess i got to add the resources
[12:21:03] <nerk> I'd suggest spending some time understanding the selectors
[12:21:22] <J1> veQue you can just hotlink it
[12:22:27] <Teduardo> nerk: it doesnt look like that was the entirety of the issue
[12:22:41] <nerk> nope
[12:22:48] <nerk> it isn't the entirety
[12:24:28] <nerk> http://jsfiddle.net/C4zRm/7/
[12:24:44] <nerk> replaceWith is the wrong thing to use with what you are trying to inject
[12:24:57] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/yWTLk/229/ help http://jquerymobile.com/branches/text-input-clear-btn/docs/demos/textinput/index.html#&ui-state=dialog trying to get  data-clear-btn="true" to work
[12:25:01] <veQue> but it's not happening
[12:25:05] <nerk> always good to add paranthesis on values that you are doing math on.
[12:25:34] <veQue> when i types omething... it should display a button to delete
[12:25:44] <nerk> so, Teduardo: http://jsfiddle.net/C4zRm/7/ should be what you were after
[12:27:04] <r3v3rb> can anyone help with this: http://jsfiddle.net/cxUWK/ validation of first form fieldset works. duplicate and submit validation works but errors aren't next to correct fields, also filling in data in either duplicated field will remove validation?
[12:27:22] <Teduardo> yep ended up here: http://jsfiddle.net/C4zRm/8/
[12:28:59] <multipass> In jquery validate-- is there any way to do a callback after one of my methods fires off?
[12:29:41] <veQue> anyone familiar with data-clear-btn?
[12:34:44] <r3v3rb> multipass: no idea I have my own issues with 'cloned' form fieldsets and jquery Validate! :\
[12:35:32] <Teduardo> i was able to get it to where if the user clicks submit and the form is valid it would let me do an if () but thats about it
[12:35:41] <Teduardo> as far as jquery validate goes =D
[12:39:38] <r3v3rb> Teduardo: are you talking about my fiddle?
[12:40:53] <r3v3rb> I have just found someone else's fiddle doing a similar thing cloning elements and using fields with names such as "xxx[]" and they have the same issue‚Ä¶ maybe its a known issue or maybe its a bug?
[12:41:42] <chasep_notworkin> how do I go about listening for an event I trigger (via this._trigger) in a custom widget, from another method in that widget?
[12:43:17] <shoky> veQue: you're looking at examples from a jqmobile branch
[12:43:34] <shoky> veQue: that feature is only gonna go into 1.3 according to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5281
[12:43:35] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Pull request on jquery-mobile by collinforrester (1w, 6d ago): Clear input button for text inputs
[12:43:52] <veQue> oh
[12:43:56] <veQue> shoky thanks
[12:47:06] <veQue> shoky: did you do a search on github for data-clear-btn?
[12:47:28] <andrew9184> is there an advantage to using custom events over triggering everything with just a click ?
[12:47:35] <andrew9184> i mean, custom events, would be triggered by a click anyways, no ?
[12:48:19] <shoky> veQue: i saw 'branches/text-input-clear-btn' in the url you posted, indicating that its a branch and not neccesarily in any released build
[12:48:31] <shoky> don't remember what i searched for specifically
[12:49:18] <shoky> but i didnt search in github, just saw a link to the PR somewhere
[12:49:33] <chasep_notworkin> here is an example of that shows what I'm trying to do: http://pastie.org/5439221
[12:50:17] <veQue> oh i see
[12:50:24] <veQue> thanks, thats a good tip
[12:50:27] <shoky> andrew9184: what do you mean triggering everything with just a click..?  what if you wanted to trigger it another way
[12:51:09] <shoky> and why would custom events be triggered by a click
[12:51:13] <zduffy> Can someone help me understand why this is not working? Doesn't look like I have any syntax errors? http://jsfiddle.net/jyXsv/3/
[12:52:14] <andrew9184> hmmm true
[12:52:31] <andrew9184> i'm making a video player and everything is mostly triggered by a click.
[12:53:01] <NaN> is it possible to user multiple handlers for .on? like $(selector).on('clicl, change'...
[12:53:27] <shoky> zduffy
[12:53:29] <NaN> u_u nevermind...
[12:53:36] <shoky> ?eval parseFloat('')
[12:53:43] <bot-t> shoky: NaN
[12:54:18] <shoky> the span's html is initially empty.. ''
[12:54:32] <shoky> and you're only running that code once on DOM ready
[12:54:55] <zduffy> So I need to set the span to 0?
[12:55:13] <shoky> zduffy: i dunno, why are you making that calculation on DOM ready?
[12:55:40] <zduffy> Its just a piece thats part of a larger project. The span in the real code gets a value set shoky
[12:56:09] <shoky> uh then what's the problem?
[12:56:56] <zduffy> It was not subtracting or adding $5
[12:57:05] <shoky> it had nothing to add or subtract from..
[12:57:15] <zduffy> In the real code it does.
[12:57:30] <NoiseEee> zduffy: it helps to actually use real code in your samples.
[12:57:38] <NoiseEee> otherwise your fake code is great!!
[12:58:03] <zduffy> Lol thanks NoiseEee. My real code has 3000+ lines and I just wanted to isolate it
[12:59:03] <NoiseEee> zduffy: then isolate it and use values that are real / etc
[12:59:05] <shoky> if the html of the span is a valid float, that code works fine
[12:59:37] <zduffy> Ok. I modified it before I jsfiddled it, so I will try that. Thank you both
[13:01:10] <Aero`> Hi guys !
[13:01:17] <Aero`> got a little problem wih wysihtml5.
[13:01:21] <Aero`> anyone would have a minute ?
[13:01:37] <NaN> Aero`: what's wysihtml5?
[13:01:54] <Aero`> it's a jQuery based WYSIWYG editor
[13:01:56] <NoiseEee> Aero`: time to go to the support forums/etc of whatever that is
[13:02:21] <Ogredude_> hey I've got a radio button with options "On" and "Off", what event am I looking to bind to make it do stuff when either radio is selected?  I tried the select() event but that's doing nothing
[13:02:34] <Aero`> allright I checked here just to see if anyone knew that plugin
[13:02:36] <Aero`> thanks anyway
[13:02:36] <Ogredude_> from what I understand, I could use click() but that won't fire if the user changes the radio via keyboard
[13:02:43] <NoiseEee> Ogredude_: click
[13:02:43] <BillCriswell> Ogredude_: change.
[13:03:13] <NoiseEee> click fires on keyboard stuff fwiw
[13:17:16] <DrDank> hello all.. --- I been out of the 'web design' for over 10yrs.. recently became a family man and I figured I would take up my old hobby.. (web design) been looking at various jQuery tutorials.. Any of you guys suggest one for a TOTAL beginner??
[13:17:56] <NoiseEee> !learn @ DrDank
[13:17:56] <b-ot> DrDank, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[13:26:28] <bt9> is there a way of easily recalculating all element heights that are expressed in % when the window is resized?
[13:28:18] <bt9> nvm, I see what I did now ;)
[13:37:09] <PaKScripT> b-ot, im not trying to be a master just be able to add some nice effects to this site I'm about to build..
[13:39:41] <shoky> PaKScripT: b-ot is a bot. read the 2nd link if you dont want to learn javascript. tho you might end up regretting that
[13:40:00] <wgolden> any of you guys jquery.cookie? For some reason $.cookie is returning undefined, but if i console log $.cookie inside of the plugin after its defined, it returns a function. Not sure why the $.cookie method isn't returned in the global scope
[13:40:16] <PaKScripT> shoky, oh wow.. lol is it that complicated??? well guess I might just have to do without.
[13:41:08] <shoky> PaKScripT: programming is not especially easy, no
[13:41:56] <PaKScripT> lol.. back when i was doing it when I was a teenager only thing out was perl, php, css and python I think it was and mysql... Now there is all kinds of crap.. but its amazing some of the stuff I have been seeing lately.
[13:42:40] <shoky> there are still all those things you mentioned
[13:44:10] <shoky> anyway if you just want to copy&paste to add some effects.. google is at your service. also see http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[13:45:53] <PaKScripT> shocky I seen soem where I need to install jQuery or something of that sort?
[13:46:16] <PaKScripT> if got some jquery snipplets I want to use but have no idea how
[13:50:58] <NoiseEee> thats where the word "learn" came in
[13:51:13] <NoiseEee> jquery is cool and all, but you still have to know how to use it
[13:56:57] <shoky> i have to learn it?? that's complicated!!
[14:01:20] <NoiseEee> you mean complimicated
[14:03:18] <danheberden> wait, isn't there a jQuery plugin to learn jQuery?
[14:03:30] <danheberden> I THOUGHT THERE WAS A PLUGIN FOR EVERYTHING
[14:13:21] <tanders> hey i am using jquery.form.js to submit data dynamically on my page
[14:13:59] <tanders> but it cant find the form that is dynamically created‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
[14:14:11] <tanders> http://jsfiddle.net/vwRwS/
[14:16:20] <shoky> tanders: if f is an id then you want $('#' + f)
[14:16:23] <BillCriswell> tanders: It's supposed to automatically create a form for you/
[14:16:38] <shoky> though..
[14:16:57] <BillCriswell> Oh, nevermind. Misinterpreted it.
[14:16:59] <shoky> if you got that id from an element, you already found the element ;) no need to re-query the dom
[14:17:17] <nev> anyone know how to get data with ajax call, but just get data with a div that has a class name x?
[14:17:28] <tanders> hmm
[14:17:30] <shoky> nev: what?
[14:18:21] <tanders> it is f but it cannot find it
[14:18:40] <tanders> i have tried just staticlly putting in '#'aform_2'
[14:18:44] <shoky> tanders: why are you re-querying with that id? if you already found the element in the line before..
[14:18:59] <shoky> $(elm).find('form').ajaxForm(...
[14:19:02] <shoky> or something
[14:19:24] <jeremy-> Anybody know of a jquery plugin that adds an additional control to a multiple select input. I basically want the multiple select to allow selection (highlited), or removal. I'm sure i could just create a parrallel control for each select entry but i figured id look for one. Cant see one yet
[14:19:32] <shoky> '#aform_2'  not '#'aform_2'   ..
[14:19:36] <tanders> ya i dunno. i will fix that
[14:19:47] <tanders> shoky typo
[14:20:02] <jeremy-> I could create a delete button to just sit next to the select but id prefer it embedded
[14:20:03] <tanders> but yes i have tried '#aform_2' there and it still cannot find it
[14:20:24] <shoky> we cant help without seeing more code/html
[14:20:39] <tanders> ok
[14:20:49] <tanders> i will fix
[14:22:51] <nev> shoky: I have a filter to filter out results and a get more button to load more data, but I only want to load data that I want filtered
[14:23:44] <sehh> hey people
[14:23:57] <shoky> nev: that's too abstract for me.. what kind of data is this?
[14:24:17] <sehh> q: is it possible to have tick marks on the slider widget? I can't see anything similar on the examples/documentation.
[14:27:19] <shoky> sehh: there's nothing built-in for that in jquery UI. you can do it yourself like here: http://jsbin.com/iwime/1/edit
[14:27:35] <catcher> nev, you can filter out what you don't want after retrieving the data. If you're trying to avoid overhead, you'd need some server-side logic to return data based on a parameter.
[14:28:59] <sehh> shoky, yeah I've already seen that, a rather awful implementation and not really what I wanted (the ticks must be outside of the slider)
[14:29:25] <sehh> I was hoping to find something more elegant
[14:33:27] <tanders> shoky http://jsfiddle.net/vwRwS/2/ is pretty much it
[14:33:53] <tanders> clicking the add promo will pop out an html form with a dynamic name and id
[14:34:23] <tanders> But it still cant submit the form
[14:35:03] <sunbeam> for some strange reason selectivzr and pie.js cannot work together
[14:35:09] <sunbeam> anyone else know how come?
[14:35:17] <sunbeam> (using behaviour attribute)
[14:36:19] <wachpwnski> doesn anyone know if you can get the gps location of apple and android devices from javascript?
[14:38:01] <shoky> tanders: that doesnt work at all. and that html snippet is bad html
[14:38:38] <tanders> :(  i know....
[14:39:31] <shoky> ok
[14:40:01] <tanders> sigh thanks for helping... im just gonna keep going at it
[14:45:10] <shoky> wachpwnski: yeah.. read about geolocation
[14:54:17] <wachpwnski> shoky, is that a chrome browser thing?
[14:54:58] * hlve[workz] slaps shoky around a bit with a large trout
[14:56:30] <shoky> wachpwnski: no it's a W3C standard
[14:56:56] <shoky> wachpwnski: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_geolocation  and  http://caniuse.com/geolocation
[14:57:33] * shoky slaps hlve[workz] around a bit with a wakeboard
[15:04:14] <draginx> Anyone here have trouble with datepicker and twitter's bootstrap?
[15:07:22] <anli_> I placed my question on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13574705/one-to-one-database-table-mapping-with-linq-expression-instead-of-string-as-key instead
[15:22:07] <wachpwnski> shoky:  this is the geolocation based on wifi. If I want to hit the gps on the device, I probably have to access the device specific api correct?
[15:22:31] <shoky> wachpwnski: you were asking about javascript
[15:22:50] <coldhead> http://diveintohtml5.info/geolocation.html
[15:27:54] <wachpwnski> coldhead and shoky, thanks, that clears it up. It will use GPS on mobile devices.
[15:29:01] <draginx> Any idea why return $.data(target, PROP_NAME); wont return anything in jquery-ui? its for .datepicker()
[15:29:17] <draginx> target (the paramter) does in fact equal to an input
[15:30:02] <wachpwnski> Is it in the jquery namespace?
[15:30:50] <draginx> yessir
[15:31:21] <draginx> https://gist.github.com/0c364c62652482ccdbdd
[15:33:33] <draginx> hmm its really strange but it doesnt seem as if jquery ui datepicker *ever* adds any kidn of $.data() O_o
[15:33:46] <draginx> nor dpDiv.data
[15:34:18] <shoky> ?
[15:34:21] <shoky> got a demo, draginx?
[15:34:28] <draginx> well...
[15:34:29] <shoky> or a jsfiddle
[15:34:32] <draginx> it works on one pafge but not another :/
[15:34:35] <draginx> i can try...
[15:34:46] <draginx> but till probably work on jsfiddle with no problems
[15:35:10] <shoky> what's  target exactly? and PROP_NAME?
[15:37:07] <draginx> hold on
[15:37:10] <draginx> im trying to get jsfiddle setup
[15:38:04] <draginx> http://jsfiddle.net/ngDwj/ try this?
[15:38:09] <draginx> shoky: ^ :)
[15:38:44] <shoky> ok, and where's the problem?
[15:38:48] <shoky> and where's $.data
[15:41:47] <coldhead> ?cc
[15:41:48] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[15:42:17] <draginx> ctrl + f for this _getInst: function(target) {
[15:42:33] <draginx> console.log('data', $.data(target, PROP_NAME)); shows "data undefined"
[15:42:40] <draginx> which shouldnt be true
[15:43:11] <draginx> _showDatepicker: function(input) { is triggering that function call
[15:43:17] <draginx> right on var inst = $.datepicker._getInst(input);
[15:43:33] <draginx> input variable does equal the DOM :)
[15:49:01] <draginx> nvm figured it out! my own fauly
[15:49:33] <coldhead> great work draginx
[15:49:38] <coldhead> take 5
[15:49:50] <draginx> coldhead: lol :) yer     if (input.hasClass(this.markerClassName))  <-- that was true :/
[16:08:35] <Kronuz> if I selected some elements with jquery as `$('a')` for instance, is there a way to filter that selectio so it only contains `<a>` elements that have different `href`?
[16:08:44] <Kronuz> how can I do that?
[16:12:49] <rmurphey> Kronuz: different from what?
[16:12:58] <rmurphey> different from each other?
[16:13:08] <Kronuz> different href attributes from eachother
[16:13:09] <Kronuz> yes
[16:13:11] <Kronuz> :)
[16:13:19] <rmurphey> so if there are five a's with the same href, which one should it choose?
[16:14:27] <coldhead> the prettiest one
[16:14:54] <coldhead> SELECT DISTINCT(href) FROM A
[16:15:58] <tw2113> you two again?
[16:15:59] <tw2113> :D
[16:17:55] <coldhead> Kronuz: http://jsfiddle.net/jkZBM/ ?
[16:18:39] <coldhead> KALLISTI
[16:19:46] <coldhead> note to self: create SQLquery, like jQuery but elements are selected via SQL-like strings
[16:20:00] <coldhead> note to self: maybe call it sqlQuery
[16:20:05] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[16:20:45] <abjorn> coldhead
[16:20:46] <abjorn> pls
[16:20:50] <abjorn> dotn
[16:21:18] <joshsmith> is there a best practice for executing jQuery code depending upon what page one is on
[16:21:29] <joshsmith> e.g. checking the id of the body, etc.
[16:21:49] <abjorn> yeah, having a separate javascript file for each page :p
[16:22:14] <joshsmith> haha
[16:23:24] <joshsmith> I mean is it necessary to wrap inside an existence check?
[16:24:17] <danheberden> i just want to hear more about sqlQuery
[16:24:20] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:24:22] <coldhead> joshsmith: if you have $('.pagen .someThingys').doSomething() and that selector doesn't match anything then it will fail silently and let you get on with your life
[16:24:44] <coldhead> which might be cleaner than a bunch of if()s to work out which code to run
[16:25:21] <joshsmith> that's what I've been doing for the past 2 years, but wasn't sure if it was really good practice
[16:26:01] <coldhead> "best" practice is probably separate files and only loading the JS you need
[16:26:14] <coldhead> like abjsy said
[16:26:40] <coldhead> in truth it doesn't really matter because no one visits sites other than facebook anyway
[16:26:48] <danheberden> truth
[16:27:00] <coldhead> you can have a 1 GB JS file included several times on every page and it will never matter to anyone
[16:27:06] <joshsmith> rofl. yes, that
[16:27:24] <joshsmith> except some of us do manage to make money not being FB, somehow
[16:28:05] <danheberden> yeah, but FB doesn't get clamidia
[16:28:14] <danheberden> *chlamydia
[16:28:31] <Kronuz> coldhead: nice!
[16:28:34] <Kronuz> thank you :D
[16:28:48] <Kronuz> thank you so much! I didn't know you could pass functions to filter
[16:29:07] <joshsmith> I always love when my CSS doesn't render at all
[16:29:07] <thepreacher> how do i attach an .on change handler to a selelct statement in a dialog box?
[16:29:17] <joshsmith> looks so beautiful
[16:43:47] <veQue> how to i make my selector for a text box based on wheter it's focused .  thisIsFromFocused = parseFloat($theFocusedText.value);
[16:45:58] <veQue> document.activeElement ?
[16:48:14] <veQue> $(":focus") i guess
[16:48:36] <someprimetime> close
[16:48:45] <someprimetime> is(':focus');
[16:49:08] <veQue> k thanks
[16:57:00] <coldhead> so cold
[16:58:33] <veQue> ironic name
[16:58:40] <code_ph0y> hey guys hows it going?
[16:59:03] <code_ph0y> ...can someone tell me to get the width and height of the viewing pane?
[16:59:10] <code_ph0y> in the browser?
[16:59:32] <veQue> ok $('focus') wont work because when i click an on screen button it becomes the focus
[17:00:16] <veQue> any way to tell it to change the last focused textbox no object?
[17:00:32] <imsky> moo
[17:01:08] <veQue> mootools?
[17:03:29] <code_ph0y> veQue whats the problem?
[17:04:04] <veQue> trying to use an onscreen calculator i foundbut i want to have a few tex inputs
[17:04:25] <veQue> i want to tie the buttons to the currently focused text input
[17:04:38] <veQue> instead of just a single text
[17:04:45] <veQue> make sense right?
[17:04:52] <coldhead> veQue: manually tracking focuses w/ blur() http://jsfiddle.net/RKFzT/
[17:05:50] <veQue> the thing is i thing as i hit the on screen buttons the buttons become the new focus
[17:05:59] <veQue> and thanks i will see if this code can help me
[17:06:17] <coldhead> it should, it lets you find the last n things which had focus
[17:06:19] <coldhead> in order
[17:06:23] <coldhead> which sounds like what you want
[17:07:27] <veQue> k will let you know
[17:07:32] <code_ph0y> yeah coldhead is right
[17:08:09] <code_ph0y> coldhead, do you know to get the height and width of the window/document?
[17:08:19] <coldhead> $(window).width()
[17:08:24] <coldhead> and similarly, height()
[17:08:35] <code_ph0y> what the uesr sees when they first load the page?
[17:08:40] <code_ph0y> is that correct?
[17:08:49] <coldhead> that's the size of the window
[17:09:01] <coldhead> if the document is very small it might have a smaller size
[17:09:05] <coldhead> $(document).height()
[17:09:13] <coldhead> but window is probably what you want
[17:09:19] <code_ph0y> nice!
[17:09:42] <code_ph0y> so $(window).width(); ... and .height?
[17:09:52] <coldhead> yup
[17:10:06] <skyjumper> is there any future-resistant way to do: $._data(element, 'events')
[17:11:13] <code_ph0y> thanks bud!
[17:11:56] <BillCriswell> skyjumper: You don't want this to work in the future?
[17:12:31] <skyjumper> BillCriswell: i wanted to say "future-proof" but that's probably impossible
[17:12:44] <BillCriswell> wait.. never mind. I hate language things.
[17:13:02] <BillCriswell> skyjumper: I think it's the same thing?
[17:13:16] <skyjumper> BillCriswell: basically, except you can't really future-proof anything
[17:13:23] <coldhead> compare water proof with water resistant
[17:13:40] <BillCriswell> coldhead: That's what I had to do to get it right in my head lol.
[17:13:59] <skyjumper> anyway, is there a way to do $._data(element, 'events') without it breaking in later versions?
[17:14:01] <coldhead> skyjumper: you're not even supposed to use that data() method for events. it's undocumented
[17:14:06] <skyjumper> coldhead: right
[17:14:27] <skyjumper> i want to get the event handlers for an element
[17:14:51] <coldhead> i guess the right way to do it would be to overload the bind() and on() handlers and keep track of what's being attached yourself
[17:15:03] <coldhead> but that's not for the squeamist
[17:15:07] <coldhead> squeamish
[17:15:10] <coldhead> and i am squeamish
[17:15:20] <skyjumper> kind of a messy hack
[17:16:03] <coldhead> yes, i wouldn't do it
[17:16:26] <coldhead> the "neat" way to do it is not to mess with the event internals at all though
[17:16:33] <coldhead> so you may not have a choice
[17:16:49] <coldhead> consider asking gnarf, he knows about such internals
[17:16:53] <coldhead> he/she*
[17:17:00] <skyjumper> why does that have to be "internal" at all?
[17:17:09] <skyjumper> shouldn't there just be an API for getting event handlers
[17:17:09] <BillCriswell> It knows about such internals.
[17:17:13] <coldhead> i don't know, man, i didn't do jQuery
[17:17:27] <skyjumper> hrm
[17:17:32] <coldhead> i guess it's internal in the sense that they reserve the right to change it later
[17:17:45] <coldhead> if they find a better way or there's a new browser method or w/e
[17:17:56] <BillCriswell> skyjumper: The first thing I looked up seemed to bring up what you're doing.
[17:18:24] <skyjumper> BillCriswell: yeah, i'm not seeing a cleaner way
[17:18:43] <coldhead> that way works NOW but it's not future-resistant
[17:19:02] <BillCriswell> Yesh. =(
[17:19:09] <coldhead> http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2
[17:19:16] <coldhead> i think that uses the data method
[17:19:36] <coldhead> lol BBC Glow
[17:19:48] <veQue> coldhead: so my variable ultimately becomes $(focused[n - 1]) ?
[17:21:20] <coldhead> yes veQue that should be the last item that had focus
[17:21:33] <veQue> doesntthis function keep pushing higher and higher?
[17:22:28] <BillCriswell> Now is a pretty bad time to realize I forgot to put on deodorant today.
[17:22:47] <veQue> yeh Bill, i didnt want to bring it up
[17:22:59] <BillCriswell> Leavin me hangin.
[17:23:15] <skyjumper> http://pigroll.com/img/web_developer_with_a_job.jpg
[17:23:21] <coldhead> veQue: this might be a less overengineered way http://jsfiddle.net/RKFzT/2/
[17:23:23] <veQue> i figured you get one pass
[17:23:31] <coldhead> it just gives class last to the last focused element
[17:23:36] <coldhead> so you can query $('.last')
[17:24:49] <BillCriswell> skyjumper: My friends were making fun of me cause I had an interview three days after halloween and I didn't want to shave for my costume.
[17:24:57] <skyjumper> hehe
[17:25:02] <BillCriswell> "Yeah, don't want to show up to that interview clean shaven'"
[17:29:17] <L1> Can anyone recommend a good plugin for me? Basically, I want to define several different dimensions in advance, then have the user select an image (file input, maybe drag and drop would be nice), and crop/resize it to the specified dimensions. they should be able to use the same image for each different size, or select a new one if they wish to
[17:29:51] <L1> Of course these different cropped images are then posted to the server
[17:31:37] <droope> Hey there! I am using a custom version of JQuery UI for my project, but I don't know exactly what it contains. Now I want to add another component (namely slider) to the pack, but without risking breaking something by accident.
[17:31:41] <droope> Any tips?
[17:31:56] <droope> I also can't remember what the theme name was :P
[17:32:29] <skyjumper> droope: just look in your script file
[17:33:02] <skyjumper> the firefox extention Library Detector can also tell you
[17:33:48] <droope> I wish the download builder had added a coment on top of the custom.js lib :P
[17:34:04] <droope> I am just going to copy the minified version of what I have and append it to the end of my ui
[17:34:12] * droope crosses fingers
[17:34:32] <coldhead> just include everything :)
[17:34:42] <coldhead> everything will work forever

[17:40:00] <coldhead> i don't think he's worried about anything anymore

[18:03:20] <veQue> just stare at screen thinking " i wonder whythis is not working"
[18:04:19] <mobile8> I've wrote this code, http://pastebin.com/WybYT8Lq, i'd like to set a delay before the animate() takes place, however setTimeout doesn't work in this case
[18:05:15] <BillCriswell> $(this).delay(500).animate() should work mobile8.
[18:09:17] <mobile8> thanks didnt know that function
[18:09:30] <mobile8> however for some reason 500 isnt 0.5 sec
[18:10:05] <Imaginativeone> 1000 milliseconds per second
[18:10:09] <Imaginativeone> .25
[18:10:19] <Imaginativeone> oops

[19:09:45] <gnarf> skyjumper: knowing what events you have bound to an element is not something you should use for production code
[19:10:16] <gnarf> If you want to track them for like debugging purposes, they hide in the private data $._data( elem, "events" )
[19:13:31] * veQue takes break
[19:14:25] <veQue> this classical music has really been helping me from losing it
[19:16:47] <coldhead> what you listening to there veQue ?
[19:16:53] <coldhead> just general classical?
[19:17:14] <veQue> http://94.23.51.96:8000
[19:25:53] <skyjumper> gnarf: it's for monkey patching a jquery plugin to do something different
[19:26:22] <skyjumper> though i do think there should be a more standard api for getting the events
[19:26:53] <gnarf> it's generally a bad practice
[19:29:53] <raj> coldhead, do you still code for meals and alcohol?
[19:30:20] <imsky> that's what he thinks he's getting
[19:30:38] <raj> what's it really?

[19:35:57] <prasanth_g> well, can anyone suggest how to fix this $ conflict issue?
[19:36:02] <prasanth_g> this is the code http://pastebin.com/3RCwjPBg
[19:36:22] <prasanth_g> tried using $.noConflict();
[19:36:29] <prasanth_g> replacing $ with jQuery
[19:36:35] <prasanth_g> but they didnt fixed
[19:38:56] <amirite> what is AMO javascript?
[19:40:24] <prasanth_g> anyone?

[19:44:04] <coldhead> prasanth_g: i really enjoy your problem
[19:44:16] <prasanth_g> :(
[19:44:43] <coldhead> what is the problem?
[19:44:49] <coldhead> the code you linked to doesn't show the problem
[19:45:00] <prasanth_g> http://pastebin.com/3RCwjPBg
[19:45:10] <prasanth_g> http://shortefilms.com
[19:45:20] <coldhead> amirite: AMD maybe?
[19:45:58] <prasanth_g> the videos are not loading in the below section
[19:46:48] <coldhead> prasanth_g: you have a syntax error
[19:47:01] <coldhead> you are missing a { before speed http://pastebin.com/aieNZc8g
[19:47:57] <prasanth_g> the braces are correctly closed
[19:48:53] <prasanth_g> here is the main code source
[19:48:54] <prasanth_g> http://www.jquerynewsticker.com/
[19:50:06] <coldhead> for some reason my browser is upset about your perfectly correct code http://i.imgur.com/991Lt.png
[19:50:14] <coldhead> see those error messages?
[19:50:26] <coldhead> i might have to download a new browser
[19:50:34] <coldhead> this might be using an old js
[19:50:37] <coldhead> brb
[19:50:44] <prasanth_g> ooh
[19:50:45] <prasanth_g> ok
[19:51:50] <coldhead> firefox 17 is upset about the same errors
[19:51:52] <coldhead> i am so sorry
[19:52:10] <coldhead> i don't know what to do
[19:52:16] <coldhead> i can't even make a web browser work
[19:52:28] <prasanth_g> its ok
[19:54:25] <prasanth_g> i think // in http:// are acting as commenting code
[19:56:35] <oojacoboo> is there any way to refresh just one file in the DOM?
[19:56:45] <oojacoboo> someone really needs to improve the way we test js
[19:57:16] <oojacoboo> this idea of editing files and refreshing the page is incredibly inefficient
[20:00:58] <coldhead> oojacoboo: there are a bunch of plugins that will watch for file changes and reload js or css
[20:01:04] <coldhead> all the cool kids are doing it now
[20:01:19] <oojacoboo> coldhead: reload js or css?
[20:01:30] <oojacoboo> just that asset in the DOM?
[20:16:20] <jerkface03> Is there a good opensource (non-GPL) file upload plugin that anyone can recommend for file uploads in jquery mobile? I don't want any UI elements. I just want to have a link that hte user can click that will show a file selection dialog and provide me with some callback functionality that'll give me info about how much of the file's been uploaded
[20:16:31] <jerkface03> Server-side would be implemented in Java.
[20:23:07] <coldhead> oojacoboo: this kind of thing https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-reloader/dnfpcpfijpdhabaoieccoclghgplmpbd ?
[20:24:38] <coldhead> jerkface03: i still haven't found a way to upload across mobile devices. would be awesome if you wrote that lib!
[20:24:44] <coldhead> good luck
[20:26:06] <coldhead> oojacoboo: also https://github.com/webxl/grunt-reload
[20:26:23] <coldhead> et hoc genus omne
[20:26:39] <jerkface03> coldhead: Why wouldn't any of the standard upload libraries work?
[20:26:47] <jerkface03> libraries/plugins
[20:29:42] <oojacoboo> coldhead: yea, I tried that Tincr, pretty cool
[20:29:52] <oojacoboo> although, I couldn't get it working with my js yet
[20:30:03] <eip56> Question: I am trying to get better at oop practices. Generally how do i decide how many functions i need? Do I just break it into tasks? Each function completes one task?
[20:30:07] <oojacoboo> not sure if that's b/c my js is combined or what
[20:31:23] <Carlitta87> my google map isnt displaying properly.....can anyone help? http://karenottarrealty.com/nmcms.php?snippet=properties&p=viewpropertydetails&mls=2563
[20:32:46] <coldhead> jerkface03: older iOS and Android don't do file iploads from the browser
[20:33:37] <coldhead> eip56: that's not a bad general rule but better than rules is to read other people's code and see what other people have done which looks readable to you
[20:41:08] <draginx> Why does flotjs end a day before my true actual time? 1353146400000 <-- is Nov 17th but the graph shows a few hours after the 16th?
[20:44:20] <coldhead> timezones?
[20:44:27] <coldhead> dates are hard, man
[20:45:22] <draginx> they shouldnt be...
[20:45:32] <oojacoboo> they are
[20:46:21] <coldhead> brendan eich has personally apologised to me for aspects of Date()
[20:46:26] <coldhead> not even kidding
[20:53:09] <oar> hi, im working on an easy project but i couldnt; im posting some variables to a php file. one of them text, others are value. i can echo values at php but not text one. can you help me ?
[20:53:51] <coldhead> sure, oar, show us the code
[20:53:53] <coldhead> ?p @ aor
[20:53:54] <bot-t> aor, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:56:15] <oar> http://jsfiddle.net/fmg6c/ thanx a lot
[20:57:35] <coldhead> oar: var kime = $('#kime').text(); should be var kime = $('#kime').val();
[20:57:49] <coldhead> even though it's a <textarea> it's still an input so you still use val()
[20:57:55] <coldhead> text() is for <p>s and so on
[21:13:28] <wiremaster> okay, I just noticed that if I declare a variable with `var` inside a function, and try to console.log() the variable from outside the function (even after the function has been called once), I get ReferenceError
[21:13:32] <wiremaster> which is cool
[21:13:33] <raj> can I get help from a jq expert?
[21:14:06] <raj> wiremaster, scoped wonderfullness
[21:14:09] <wiremaster> BUT, if I declare a function to a variable with var, INSIDE the said outer function
[21:14:24] <wiremaster> and then call the outer function once
[21:14:36] <wiremaster> and then call the varName() from outside, it works
[21:14:39] <wiremaster> why?
[21:14:48] <raj> example?
[21:16:38] <wiremaster> 'ec
[21:16:46] <wiremaster> s/'ec/'sec
[21:18:46] <raj> any jq experts around? I'd like to buy you dinner to help me resolve an event issue (due to the global name of the event or something)
[21:19:03] <jrockjiggz2> ask?
[21:19:06] <jrockjiggz2> ?ask
[21:19:06] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[21:19:12] <jrockjiggz2> heh
[21:19:50] <raj> here's a recap http://paste.ofcode.org/7xEsGDjV5CEd8XKKXvUDLY
[21:19:56] <raj> in case you missed it
[21:20:58] <wiremaster> okay
[21:20:59] <wiremaster> http://pastebin.com/i47ur1Ga
[21:21:14] <wiremaster> I tried to jsFiddle it but couldn't get it to work proper
[21:21:22] <wiremaster> put that in your firebug console
[21:21:46] <raj> wiremaster, that's cuz you set num = x
[21:22:02] <jrockjiggz2> wow its 7am where you are?
[21:22:06] <wiremaster> raj, I did not call gSetNumber
[21:22:09] <raj> wait no
[21:22:48] <wiremaster> ugh, that pastebin is a bit wrong
[21:23:14] <wiremaster> here cleaned it up
[21:23:14] <wiremaster> http://pastebin.com/yp2UuKCk
[21:23:47] <raj> any jq expert mind if I get them dinner for some assistance renaming an event?
[21:25:03] <raj> wiremaster, I think because functions are dirtily hoisted
[21:25:27] <wiremaster> just another JS brainf*ck, or is the code at fault?
[21:25:32] <raj> I didn't realize this happens, but I'm glad to be aware of this now, thanks
[21:26:36] <jrockjiggz2> raj: threedubmedia drag event is way cool
[21:26:50] <raj> yeah, except it's randomly broken
[21:27:14] <jrockjiggz2> well, you're combining the feature with file-upload's already existing feature
[21:28:14] <jrockjiggz2> well, i haven't been up to date with file-upload, but I would assume the drop area is listening for a specific event... where you'd have to change to listen for the event fired from the eventdrag plugin
[21:28:19] <raj> jrockjiggz2, I'm not combining them
[21:28:29] <jrockjiggz2> ohh ok
[21:28:51] <raj> it has to do with tdm's plugin using a gobal event
[21:28:59] <amirite> so what's AMO
[21:29:05] <raj> it uses 'drop' and then never gives it back or something
[21:30:11] <jrockjiggz2> raj: using live?
[21:31:41] <jrockjiggz2> if the conflict is the namespace, then what Eviltwin said, replace all drag wholewords to that of tdmDrag
[21:32:53] <raj> jrockjiggz2, but the word drag/drop is used in other instances too it seems
[21:33:06] <jrockjiggz2> like so http://dpaste.org/Z2DeV/
[21:33:17] <jrockjiggz2> oh
[21:34:24] <jrockjiggz2> it seems drop in dd.drop is part of the data from the event, it shouldnt conflict
[21:34:51] <jrockjiggz2> it just looks drag needs to be renamed to be compatible
[21:43:51] <raj> jrockjiggz, would this file fix my issues? https://github.com/threedubmedia/jquery.threedubmedia/blob/master/event.drop/jquery.event.drop.live.js
[21:54:14] <jrockjiggz> raj - possible
[22:22:35] <raj> jrockjiggz, didn't seem to work
[22:39:32] <raj> I'd like to monetarily and huggitarily compensate a jq expert for their help in getting an event in a plugin's js file renamed, so it doesn't interfere with another event from another plugin
[22:48:11] <vladikoff> raj, what are the plugins?
[22:48:16] <vladikoff> ?paste @ raj
[22:48:16] <bot-t> raj, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:48:30] <vladikoff> raj, put links there in a fiddle or something ^
