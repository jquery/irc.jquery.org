[00:00:21] <xec> Es0teric: ok. you seem to be missing some javascript, the field looks empty?
[00:00:53] <Es0teric> its empty
[00:01:03] <Es0teric> because i am trying to figure out how to do it
[00:01:29] <StevenCodes22> Es0teric:  Also you didnt change id="product_page" for the other two , on first you have class="product_page"
[00:01:46] <xec> Es0teric: have you tried what you suggested earlier? the selector with the ids, except you swap # with . ?
[00:01:53] <patrickvw> Can someone help with sortables
[00:01:57] <Es0teric> StevenCodes22 its projects_page not products_page
[00:01:57] <Es0teric> :|
[00:02:15] <Es0teric> xec, if it doesnt work with id's
[00:02:15] <StevenCodes22> w/e
[00:02:17] <xec> Es0teric: StevenCodes22 is still right
[00:02:25] <Es0teric> then why do have that working fine now?
[00:02:33] <StevenCodes22> show it
[00:03:07] <xec> Es0teric: fix html first, then try your code. i can't tell you what's wrong with your script if you do not have a script
[00:03:39] <StevenCodes22> ^^ Boom
[00:03:47] <Es0teric> xec -> http://jsfiddle.net/WQn7s/4/
[00:03:52] <Es0teric> BOOM
[00:04:01] <Es0teric> OH NO it doesnt work with ID's
[00:04:02] <Es0teric> OH NO
[00:04:27] <xec> Es0teric: you are going to experience erratic behaviour with invalid html
[00:04:52] <StevenCodes22> Es0teric:  Still invalid
[00:05:07] <Es0teric> xec
[00:05:20] <Es0teric> so all i have to do is change #projects_page to .projects_page
[00:05:35] <xec> Es0teric: yes, and the id's into classes
[00:05:35] <fubhy> in general one should avoid id's whenever possible
[00:05:45] <fubhy> classes are much better when building a project
[00:05:57] <fubhy> id's are for special cases only
[00:06:00] <fubhy> where the element is really unique
[00:06:05] <Es0teric> like a container
[00:06:07] <fubhy> classes should be used for all other cases
[00:06:11] <xec> fubhy: that's not entirely true - IDs are good for semantically unique elements
[00:06:20] <fubhy> only when the element is really unique
[00:06:27] <fubhy> and needs to be targeted uniquely
[00:06:33] <fubhy> in most cases that is not needed
[00:06:47] <fubhy> so in most projects you can turn the majority of the id's into classes
[00:06:48] <Es0teric> xec -> http://jsfiddle.net/WQn7s/6/
[00:06:49] <Es0teric> now
[00:06:53] <fubhy> and thereby also optimize your css
[00:06:53] <Es0teric> how do i refine that?
[00:06:53] <Whirl3d> but careful and judicious use of IDs can really speed up your queries
[00:07:56] <xec> Es0teric: that looks better, what do you mean by refine - is it not doing what you needed?
[00:08:16] <Es0teric> xec, its doing what i needed
[00:08:19] <fubhy> id's are nice and all, but often used incorrectly or when not needed
[00:08:21] <Es0teric> but you said it can be messy
[00:08:25] <Es0teric> or was it because
[00:08:29] <Es0teric> it had id's
[00:08:29] <Es0teric> ?
[00:08:40] <xec> Es0teric: yes, it was about the IDs
[00:08:47] <Es0teric> -_-
[00:08:57] <StevenCodes22> IDs are for one element you were using them on three
[00:09:06] <xec> Es0teric: it really is far more important than you realize
[00:09:10] <StevenCodes22> so he suggested classes as used for a Group of elements
[00:09:21] <Es0teric> i know
[00:09:24] <patrickvw> How can I make this code to save all sort-orders http://jsfiddle.net/patrickvw/GASNb/ now only sort0- works
[00:09:28] <StevenCodes22> cool
[00:09:31] <Es0teric> what id's are best used for
[00:09:34] <xec> Es0teric: lets say you wanted to select all the project pages and did $('#projects_page') <-- you would only get the first one
[00:09:35] <Es0teric> and what classes are best used for
[00:09:36] <Es0teric> i said
[00:09:38] <Es0teric> i can change that later
[00:09:59] <aqeel> id specific class group
[00:10:03] <ximarin> hi all, question  for jqueryUI: How can I get the index of a selected tab when using .tabs() ?
[00:10:15] <xec> Es0teric: but you really can't - you need valid html before starting work on css and javascript
[00:10:37] <patrickvw> xec : $(this).attr('id');
[00:10:44] <aqeel> yup....get basics straight first...
[00:10:48] <Es0teric> whatever
[00:10:52] <Es0teric> it worked the first time around
[00:10:55] <Es0teric> it still works the second
[00:11:18] <StevenCodes22> Thats lazy though man
[00:11:23] <aqeel> well if u want to go hard way upto u.....but then u will face lots of problems
[00:11:48] <sj0bidoo> Does anyone know why this scriptsnippet make my page jump to the top everytime the loop runs to change slider of my slideshow: http://pastebin.com/V7U8iWvd   ? :)
[00:12:34] <sj0bidoo> (not the clickevent..but the regular timeout loop)
[00:12:51] <sj0bidoo> oh..the clickevent too :P
[00:12:58] <Es0teric> PHP 5.4 traits
[00:13:03] <Es0teric> is freakin cool
[00:13:25] <xec> sj0bidoo: could you make it a live demo at jsfiddle.net ?
[00:13:34] <Cork> sj0bidoo: does .karusell have a fixd height?
[00:13:40] <Cork> *fixed
[00:14:02] <sj0bidoo> Cork: no
[00:14:07] <sj0bidoo> Cork: should it? :P
[00:14:23] <Cork> dislay:none will collapse .karusell
[00:14:36] <sj0bidoo> aha
[00:14:49] <Cork> that will mean if you hit the bottom of the page when that happens, the page will be moved up by the karusells height
[00:15:02] <Whirl3d> anybody know off-hand what the OOP pattern name is where you hand a task to one element, it takes off it's part, then hands the remainder to the next element...and so on until it's gone....(I iknow what is "it" and what do I mean by "task"...it's not an easy question to ask...lol)
[00:16:01] <patrickvw> Uhmm observer pattern
[00:16:13] <sj0bidoo> Cork: thanks alot man.. setting the fixed height solved it :D
[00:17:15] <Cork> sj0bidoo: another point, your running two timers and expects them to run in sync
[00:17:37] <Cork> sj0bidoo: there is no garantee for that, so if posible you should merge them into one timer event
[00:18:04] <Cork> oh wait
[00:18:10] <Cork> its just indentation errors
[00:18:19] <Cork> sj0bidoo: so scratch that comment
[00:18:51] <sj0bidoo> hehe ok :)
[00:21:40] <blood> how to add tab function ? http://jsfiddle.net/ejECB/
[00:22:34] <Cork> blood: tab function?
[00:22:52] <blood> if i click image the content will show
[00:23:36] <Cork> blood: have an assosiated element you run .show() on?
[00:23:39] <blood> sample if i click first image the first content will show,, if i click second image the second content will show and first content will hide
[00:25:00] <blood> how to add the function ?
[00:25:09] <blood> im is noob in jquery
[00:25:11] <xec> blood: did you write that script yourself?
[00:25:41] <blood> no because some one help me,, :D
[00:27:05] <codepal> can somebody give the quick answer to why my menu does not display using visibility: visible ?
[00:27:20] <codepal> it works fine in Opera & Google Chrome
[00:27:29] <codepal> yet not in Firefox 10 / IE8
[00:27:45] <Cork> ?demo @ codepal
[00:27:46] <bot-t> codepal, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:27:51] <Whirl3d> if you can tell me how long is a piece of string, I can answer your question about as accurately
[00:28:03] <xec> blood: there is already a jQuery UI tabs plugin, maybe easier for you to use that. not sure how easy it is to swap out the tab buttons for images though
[00:28:32] <Es0teric> whats the background property in .css()? because its not $('#divhere').css({ 'background' : 'url(urlhere) no-repeat center bottom' });
[00:28:32] <IgnisDiabolus> use display: block; or opacity: 1 from opacity: 0 or .hide() and .show()
[00:28:58] <Cork> Es0teric: background is a shorthand
[00:29:08] <Es0teric> so i should use background-image right, Cork?
[00:29:10] <Cork> Es0teric: you need to use the longhand versions
[00:29:13] <Cork> yes
[00:29:13] <Es0teric> ahi see
[00:29:24] <Cork> or backgroundImage if you want the js version
[00:29:38] <blood> xec i already test and it work propely,, the problem i must include uch script, jquery ui, jquery min, and jquery css
[00:29:52] <Cork> css({ backgroundImage: 'url()', 'background-image': 'url()' })
[00:31:00] <xec> blood: well, you presented a relatively sophisticated snippet, and asked a rather basic question. you can easily show and hide elements with .show() and .hide() which seems to be all you need to do?
[00:31:58] <blood> xec where i must place them ?
[00:32:19] <xec> blood: there are examples of how to use these methods in the documentation
[00:32:33] <blood> owh ok i will try,, :D
[00:33:34] <Es0teric> cork, in backgroundPosition : 'center bottom' can be passed right?
[00:33:35] <raj> Cork, how can I rebuilt classmap out of a json object?
[00:33:41] <raj> *rebuild
[00:33:50] <Cork> Es0teric: yes
[00:33:56] <Cork> Es0teric: or percents
[00:34:00] <Cork> 50% 100%
[00:34:25] <Cork> raj: should work out of the box
[00:34:45] <Cork> raj: what does your json look like?
[00:35:17] <Es0teric> this is so wierd.. its passing in the border but not the background image...
[00:35:38] <tetradon> I have a div being append with ajax. I'm trying to use .live("keypress", function() {...} on the newly appended element but it doesn't run the proper function but if I refresh the page everything works like normal
[00:36:06] <tetradon> I can I use .live on keypress?
[00:36:21] <Cork> yes
[00:36:25] <Es0teric> cork -> backgroundRepeat, backgroundImage, backgroundPosition, backgroundColor those are all valid properties to pass into .css() right?
[00:36:48] <Cork> tetradon: the target element has to be able to take focus though
[00:36:57] <Cork> Es0teric: should be
[00:37:03] <Es0teric> for some reason
[00:37:10] <Es0teric> the backgroundImage one
[00:37:11] <Es0teric> isnt working
[00:37:48] <Es0teric> meaning its not showing the image
[00:37:55] <tetradon> So the old textarea still has focus then?
[00:38:37] <tetradon> Or just the new textarea never gets focus so that's why it's not working?
[00:39:20] <raj> Cork, trying to figure that out, some other issue came up server side so i need a sec
[00:39:36] <Cork> Es0teric: hmm ya, it doesn't for me either... not sure why
[00:40:10] <Es0teric> cork, also changing it to 'background-image' : 'url(urlhere)' doesnt work either
[00:40:29] <Cork> tetradon: check document.activeElement
[00:40:54] <Cork> Es0teric: typ seeing that too; and i've used that my self in older versions of jquery so...
[00:41:13] <Cork> ah... typo >_<
[00:41:38] <FinalAngel> i have a collection of jquery elements and would like to filter out 3 specific elements, is that somehow achievable via filter?
[00:41:48] <Cork> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/afDgf/1/
[00:41:49] <Cork> wfm
[00:41:49] <caniuse> Cork: Works For Me
[00:42:24] <Es0teric> wait
[00:42:31] <Es0teric> cork, i need the complete url?
[00:42:34] <Es0teric> i cant use relative urls?
[00:42:42] <Cork> should work fine
[00:43:01] <Es0teric> backgroundImage : 'url(images/inset-shadow.jpg)' <--- doesnt work
[00:43:19] <Cork> try taking an absolute
[00:43:20] <tetradon> it gives focus back to the body
[00:43:43] <Cork> /full/path/to/image/inset-shadow.jpg
[00:43:56] <Es0teric> cork, yeah
[00:43:58] <Es0teric> that works
[00:44:23] <Cork> when your addin inline css, it looks from your html documents path, not the css files path
[00:44:32] <Es0teric> i see
[00:44:42] <Cork> thats why you rarly want to use relative paths
[00:45:48] <raj> Cork, http://paste.ofcode.org/5cu9nkgUsC9BicPGhHBNqV
[00:46:20] <Cork> raj: is that a json string or a parsed object?
[00:46:51] <Cork> and how are you getting that one?
[00:46:57] <raj> Cork, basically, I am using a templating engine which can pass variables from the server in building the html
[00:47:28] <raj> so I have if ({{classmap}} !== null) {
[00:47:42] <raj> where {{classmap}} is the variable passed from my server
[00:47:52] <Cork> raj: that sounds like its nither a parsed string or a valid json string then
[00:47:56] <raj> maybe if I just make it an object
[00:48:09] <Cork> raj: you need to html entity decode it first
[00:48:13] <Cork> then parse the json
[00:48:19] <Cork> then you can work with it
[00:48:38] <Es0teric> ok, ran into another speedbump
[00:49:24] <Es0teric> i have icons on the page which i want to click.. so when i click on the icon, i want it to show the corresponding div's
[00:50:48] <AdvoWork> don't suppose anyone here has a really good understanding of Datatables/Jeditable ?
[00:51:41] <codepal> so I set attr('style', 'visibility: visible; display: block !important') - menu's fixed
[00:53:29] <Cork> codepal: i can almost garantee you want to use css instead of attr
[00:53:44] <Cork> codepal: else you risk resetting stryles added to the element
[00:54:05] <codepal> risk is factored
[00:54:08] <codepal> ;-)
[00:54:21] <Cork> uh...
[00:54:26] <Cork> why take the risk at all?
[00:54:36] <Es0teric> cork, how would you go about showing/hiding elements on click based on arbitrary list items?
[00:54:47] <codepal> why think the sky is falling when it's not?
[00:55:28] <Cork> ... i hate ppl that write asumptios code...
[00:55:59] <Cork> Es0teric: either add a data-something attribute to the element to point on the element you want it to relate to
[00:56:12] <Cork> Es0teric: or if there dom posision can tell it, its even simpler
[00:56:36] <Es0teric> cork, yeah i mean, right now i am hiding divs adjacent to the first div in a container
[00:56:57] <Es0teric> so i want to actually click a list item and show the next one or click the list item before it and show the prev
[00:57:28] <Cork> .next() ?
[00:58:06] <Cork> or you can grab the index() of the list
[00:58:26] <Es0teric> cork, i was thinking of setting up a hash in the href of the list items
[00:58:26] <Cork> and then look in the container and find that child and hide the old and show that one
[00:58:49] <Cork> Es0teric: href on a list item??
[00:59:03] <Cork> li's doens't have href
[00:59:07] <Es0teric> like.. <a href="#item1">item1</a>
[00:59:18] <Cork> uh thats not an li -_-'
[00:59:29] <Es0teric> so <li><a href="#item1">item1</a></li>
[00:59:57] <Cork> ya, then you could fall back on a none css version too
[01:00:00] <Cork> that would be nice
[01:00:20] <Es0teric> yeah
[01:00:37] <Es0teric> but cork, the best way i can explain the <li> to <div> relevance is
[01:01:14] <Es0teric> on the loop that i have, all of it is in the same data output.. so <div> would be 1 and <li> would be 1.. then the next item would be <div> 2 then <li> 2
[01:01:16] <Es0teric> you see what i mean?
[01:04:24] <jim_m> how do you refresh an ad without refreshing the whole page?
[01:06:12] <Cork> Es0teric: i'll have to dig about can't remember the sub-class selector off hand
[01:06:24] <Es0teric> i see...
[01:06:27] <Cork> jim_m: add a timestamp or similar at the end of the image url
[01:06:56] <jim_m> cork, what if I want to refresh it on a click event on the page
[01:07:27] <raj> Cork, my variable, when null, is &#34;null&#34
[01:07:34] <dodo123> hi
[01:07:41] <raj> I think those are { and }
[01:07:48] <raj> or maybe quotations
[01:08:06] <dodo123> every one here can give a hellp
[01:08:10] <Cork> Es0teric: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/CSS/:target
[01:08:36] <Cork> raj: they are encoded html entities yes
[01:08:49] <Cork> raj: in other words you get html not unicode that you need
[01:08:52] <jim_m> cork, the ad would be in a div, not an iframe
[01:09:07] <Cork> raj: so you need to let the html parser convert it for you
[01:09:22] <Cork> raj: $('<div/>').html(json).text()
[01:09:50] <Cork> jim_m: then you need to make an ajax call grab the new ad and replace the div
[01:10:03] <Es0teric> cork, thats not what i was looking for..
[01:10:30] <raj> Cork, it's just a string though, not in a div or anything
[01:10:33] <Cork> Es0teric: what i meant is, that can be used as a fallback for ppl that doesn't have javascript enabled
[01:10:43] <raj> can I convert the string directly?
[01:11:00] <jim_m> cork, thanks
[01:11:05] <Cork> raj: you can regex if you stor a list of all the html enteties
[01:11:22] <Cork> raj: but the best solution is 1. don't use the themer to send the json
[01:11:23] <Es0teric> right cork
[01:11:29] <Cork> or 2. let the parser convert it
[01:11:45] <Es0teric> cork, for now i'd rather let the parser convert it
[01:11:47] <Cork> raj: as it is, its not usable, as its not valid json
[01:11:52] <raj> i think I need a better way to send it from the server
[01:11:53] <Es0teric> but each element is adjacent to the next
[01:11:59] <raj> so it doesn't look screwy with the &#4
[01:12:01] <raj> or whatever
[01:12:02] <Es0teric> so i just want to trigger a back and fourth thing
[01:12:08] <patrickvw> http://www.pcwsolutions.nl/SORTABLE/html.php giving me a headache. How can I save the sortorder properly?? Sorting works id's load fine. I have problems with the .remove() and append() part
[01:12:19] <Cork> raj: its not screwy, just encoded
[01:12:32] <Bacta> Is there any way I can trigger beforeShowDay manually? Say at the end of an AJAX call?
[01:12:39] <Bacta> This is for DatePicker by the way
[01:13:04] <raj> Cork, but no easy way to decode
[01:13:16] <raj> i try to avoid regex at all costs
[01:13:40] <Cork> raj: JSON.parse($('<div/>').html(json).text()) should work
[01:14:02] <Cork> though as i said, ya i would defenitly avoid the themer for this info instead
[01:14:03] <raj> but why am I including the dom?
[01:14:14] <raj> what themer?
[01:14:23] <Cork> raj: cause thats the simplest way to convert the encoded string
[01:14:34] <Cork> raj: the one you use to send your json
[01:14:54] <Cork> its encoding the string and that needs to be reverted
[01:15:03] <patrickvw> do you see this post or am i in Stealh mode?
[01:17:35] <Whirl3d> i seee it
[01:17:42] <patrickvw> o thnx
[01:18:05] <patrickvw> Than no one can or will help me :-(
[01:18:31] <rabbi1> I am using jquery for dropdown sub menus, and there a 1px gap on the top and left of the submenu, how can i avoid this 1px gap ?
[01:18:53] <patrickvw> margin-top:-1px; :-)
[01:19:00] <Whirl3d> patrickvw, i looked at  your fiddle earlier and for the life of me can't figure out what you are asking
[01:19:01] <patrickvw> Ipad?
[01:19:49] <patrickvw> Whirl3d: please take a look at this http://www.pcwsolutions.nl/SORTABLE/html.php
[01:20:27] <patrickvw> When you grap the div and sort it in a other way, I want to save this new order.
[01:20:29] <Whirl3d> what is it supposed to do?
[01:21:10] <patrickvw> it saves the sortorder and the open/close order in a cookie
[01:21:32] <Whirl3d> and?
[01:21:37] <patrickvw> So when a user returns, the order is own order
[01:21:44] <Cork> patrickvw: i think serializeArray() should generate a list of the sortable for you
[01:21:50] <Bacta> Anyone have any ideas? I want to invoke beforeShowDay on a DatePicker when an AJAX request returns.
[01:21:56] <patrickvw> The saving past of the div order wont work
[01:22:09] <Cork> patrickvw: then you just have to generate the elements in that order, or move them there
[01:22:24] <patrickvw> The saving part of the open/close order works fine
[01:22:32] <patrickvw> I know but how!!
[01:23:10] <patrickvw> I can get it to generate the right ids as you can see, but Iam having problems with the .remove() and .append() part
[01:23:17] <Cork> patrickvw: take the generated array, grab the first identifier in it, move the coresponding element first (prepend) in the list
[01:23:31] <Cork> move each element in the list there and you should have it sotred
[01:23:34] <Whirl3d> build a constructor that reads the cookie on page ready and builds the items in the order you want them.
[01:23:35] <Cork> *sorted
[01:25:57] <raj> Cork, ok, fixed the encoding
[01:26:16] <raj> however, it's still not applying the same classes
[01:26:40] <Cork> ok
[01:26:57] <Cork> raj: demo needed to be able to tell more
[01:27:18] <raj> Cork, this is JSON.stringify(classmap) --> http://paste.ofcode.org/kEJAeGxBP5z5smuMFcE2pk
[01:27:39] <raj> and demo--> http://71.232.89.204:8080/test
[01:27:52] <Cork> raj: you have dubble classmap
[01:28:13] <Cork> classmap.classmap.classmap[0].className
[01:28:15] <innociv> How do I trace where a function was called from?  I have this function called way more than it should as well as not working how it used to after a recentish Chrome update.
[01:28:53] <Cork> innociv: attributes.calee
[01:29:02] <Cork> innociv: * attributes.callee
[01:29:27] <Cork> callee is depricated though, so don't leave it in your code
[01:29:30] <raj> k, fixed the double classmap
[01:29:45] <raj> oh
[01:29:47] <raj> even more
[01:29:48] <raj> :)
[01:30:39] <rabbi1> patrickvw: i have used that trick, but sometimes, the submenu flickers
[01:30:45] <innociv> "attributes is not defined".  How am I supposed to define that?
[01:31:08] <raj> Cork, --> Could not convert JavaScript argument arg 0 [nsIDOM3Node.compareDocumentPosition]
[01:31:19] <raj> you can see it live
[01:31:40] <raj> if you click a checkbox and then press refresh...the checkbox should be checked again, but it's not...and this error is in console
[01:31:42] <Cork> raj: str?
[01:31:43] <rabbi1> patrickvw: that way it's possible to avoid, i have used it. but inbetween the time the submenu gets loaded.
[01:32:02] <rabbi1> if the cursor is placed on the gap accidentally, the submenu flickers
[01:32:44] <Cork> raj: could you split the $.each callback to its own row?
[01:32:59] <Cork> can't put a break point on it as it is
[01:33:16] <raj> not sure what you mean
[01:33:28] <Cork> line 1086
[01:33:36] <raj> break it out of the if?
[01:33:42] <Cork> after obj) { adda line break
[01:33:55] <Cork> $.each(classmap, function(i, obj) {
[01:34:02] <AdvoWork> anyone know why when im doing: var row = $(this).closest("tr").get(0);oTable = $('#table').dataTable();	var aData = oTable.fnGetData(row);console.log(aData);  its showing the old original data that was generated, rather than what i've just changed it to? I was told its getting an old reference, but I can't see where or how to get the "new" one
[01:34:12] <raj> done
[01:35:03] <Whirl3d> Anybody remember how to extend jquery to use custom selectors. Ajpiano showed me once how to make it possible to define a selector like $("p:someting") where :something was a custom attribute.
[01:35:58] <Whirl3d> nvm found it finally
[01:36:15] <Cork> raj: replace the find(obj.id) with .find('li[data-cb-id="' + obj.id + '"]')
[01:38:10] <raj> Cork, it freaking works!
[01:38:15] <raj> how the heck did you do that?
[01:38:21] <raj> what was wrong?
[01:38:24] <LukeNukem> Hello
[01:38:38] <raj> and THANK YOU THANK YOU
[01:38:38] <LukeNukem> how can i use jquery to grab certain vars from php?
[01:38:43] <Cork> raj: added a breakpoint on the row i asked you to move to its own row
[01:38:50] <LukeNukem> like php can output multiple numbers..and jquery should grab it
[01:38:53] <LukeNukem> json?
[01:39:01] <Cork> raj: then added a watch for the different parts until i found what broke
[01:39:12] <Cork> raj: then modified the watch until it worked
[01:39:22] <Zogot> what you mean by "grab" LukeNukem.  What kind of thing are you trying to do
[01:39:38] <Cork> raj: the debugger is your friend :)
[01:39:49] <LukeNukem> ok well i have a status liking and disliking system, what i do now is manipulation to make it look realtime(increase the like/dislike counter on ajax request success callback)
[01:39:56] <LukeNukem> i am incrementing and decrementing
[01:40:14] <LukeNukem> but i figured it would be better if i did a query instead and then update it with the real values which will be more accurate
[01:40:29] <LukeNukem> so i  can get php query to return the output '43' and i need to use jquery to grab that
[01:40:41] <Cork> raj: the old selector tried to select on the pure value from data-cb-id, and firstly its a number not a string, and secondly thats not a valid selector
[01:40:49] <Cork> raj: so the selector was completly broken
[01:41:06] <Zogot> LukeNukem: I would say a timeout with a ajax function, but I've never done anything like that before
[01:41:28] <LukeNukem> Zogot, what is a timeout with an ajax function? o.o
[01:41:40] <Zogot> PHP can't output to a person unless they "refresh", it isn't a active system (forgot the proper name)
[01:42:18] <Zogot> LukeNukem: setTimeout which runs a function that does an AJAX request, but maybe someone more knowledgable than me would have a better idea or so
[01:42:22] <LukeNukem> Zogot, well an ajax request is done
[01:42:31] <LukeNukem> when the user clicks like or dislike
[01:42:38] <LukeNukem> so it depends on user not automatic
[01:42:45] <Zogot> But you want it to update when other people click no?
[01:42:51] <LukeNukem> yes when ppl click
[01:43:14] <AdvoWork> how would I go about getting the 77 from: <span class="editable" id="unit_price_513" title="">77</span> but only if the class says editable? for "this" ?
[01:43:29] <Cork> ?.text @ AdvoWork
[01:43:30] <bot-t1> AdvoWork, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[01:43:33] <Zogot> Yeh, but User 1 didn't update it, so each user is going to have to refresh the page (or use ajax)
[01:43:50] <LukeNukem> Zogot, what do you mean
[01:44:07] <raj> Cork, how can I check the 'watch'?
[01:44:16] <raj> i think what you did would be invaluable if I could learn it
[01:44:40] <Zogot> User 1 presses like, it runs the ajax, User 2 presses like, User 1 can't see it unless he also "refreshes" or makes a request to the server
[01:44:59] <Cork> raj: you have a watch list (differes a bit where depending on what debugger your using)
[01:45:10] <Cork> raj: just paste the js code to watch in there
[01:45:10] <LukeNukem> Zogot, yes, i will do a automatic running script later.
[01:45:11] <LukeNukem> ;>
[01:45:16] <raj> firebug
[01:45:23] <Zogot> Thats the main part of what your trying to do though
[01:45:27] <Zogot> but ok
[01:45:41] <Cork> raj: then in the script tab to the right you have a watch tab
[01:45:49] <LukeNukem> its more accurate though :>
[01:45:52] <raj> oh, i see it
[01:45:54] <raj> never knew what that was
[01:45:58] <Cork> raj: it will run the code in its list in the current scope your in
[01:46:00] <raj> so paste the line I wanna watch?
[01:46:09] <Cork> yes
[01:46:10] <raj> or if i break, it'll just watch it automatically?
[01:46:39] <Cork> nope you need to add what you want to watch, it watches some variables automatically
[01:47:02] <Cork> but function calls or equations you need to add your self
[01:47:22] <Cork> and yes, its really handy
[01:47:40] <raj> add a break as well?
[01:47:43] <Cork> (you can generate conditional breakpoints with the same tecneq)
[01:47:45] <raj> or just a  watch is good enough?
[01:47:55] <raj> and what if I have the same line twice?
[01:48:01] <raj> how will it know which to watch?
[01:48:09] <Cork> depends, if you want to watch it in a specific scope, you need to break the code in that scope
[01:48:44] <Cork> so ex. adding a breakpoint on like 1087 in your example will let you watch variables in that loop
[01:49:01] <Cork> that is the local obj.id and so forth
[01:49:40] <raj> Cork, so i pasted $('#colors').find('li[data-cb-id="' + obj.id + '"]').attr('class', obj.className); in the New watch expression area
[01:49:46] <raj> but nothing happened when I refreshed the page
[01:49:59] <yannickoo> hey guys
[01:50:16] <Cork> raj: first you prob want $('#colors').find('li[data-cb-id="' + obj.id + '"]')
[01:50:24] <Cork> raj: and secondly you need to add a breakpoint
[01:50:34] <Cork> (right click the link number in the script view)
[01:50:41] <yannickoo> does anybody know a jquery plugin which transforms a <textarea> with | (pipe) seperated text into tags?
[01:50:45] <Cork> uhh click not right click
[01:51:30] <raj> referenceerror: obj is not defined
[01:51:43] <raj> what line do I break on?
[01:51:47] <raj> the line I'm watching?
[01:51:55] <Cork> 1087
[01:52:00] <yannickoo> something like http://webcloud.se/code/jQuery-TaggingTools/ for textareas
[01:52:10] <raj> cool
[01:52:40] <raj> oh dude
[01:52:45] <raj> that's cool
[01:52:54] <raj> although I don't know what exactly I'm looking for
[01:53:40] <raj> seeing if it picked up the correct li?
[01:53:53] <raj> cuz it's obviously stopped at the first in the .each loop
[01:54:31] <raj> is the watch thing just like typing in an expression in the console while the script has been breaked somewhere?
[01:56:20] <JustInTime_> Hello ? can someone help me with a Ajax PUT request issue ?
[01:57:28] <raj> i should just read up on this
[01:57:45] <raj> thanks Cork, you were really tremendous
[02:00:37] <JustInTime_> My WCF Data Service expects an Int64 as ID, when I send my json ajax PUT request (over JQuery) it just throws a conversion exception........
[02:01:30] <Cork> raj: http://blog.getfirebug.com is quite full of nice tips
[02:06:15] <Cork> JustInTime_: your sending a string?
[02:06:31] <Cork> is "ID":"10" or "ID":10 ?
[02:08:18] <JustInTime_> yes... I'm sending it as ID+"L" because that's what the OData doc said I should do when sending Longs
[02:08:42] <Cork> that would be a string then
[02:09:00] <Cork> unless it expects a string that wouldn't work
[02:09:57] <JustInTime_> Well the documentation said it to do this way.. so I think the receiving end parsers are designed to be able to parse Strings
[02:10:28] <JustInTime_> It's strange because in 1 particular occasion it can actually parse the projectID (which is also a long)
[02:11:08] <Cork> JustInTime_: whats the language of the server?
[02:12:54] <milligan> I'm trying to create a Dialog, modal, that's meant to show two configurations. Is there any way I can make the dialog width adjust to the two elements it contains ?
[02:13:50] <Cork> vertically yes; horisontaly no
[02:14:02] <Cork> height: auto; on dialog-container should work fine
[02:14:28] <Cork> or rather dialog({ height: 'auto' })
[02:16:29] <JustInTime_> Cork: I'm using a WCF Data Service with OData protocol
[02:16:56] <Cork> JustInTime_: then you need to ask in there support forum
[02:17:05] <Cork> or what ever support they have
[02:17:16] <JustInTime_> ok tnx
[02:23:22] <jarr0dsz> hey everyone
[02:23:32] <jarr0dsz> if you go to http://corp.badoo.com/news/blog/ and see left below language selector
[02:23:41] <jarr0dsz> what jquery plugin could i use for such functinality?
[02:23:53] <jarr0dsz> i mean whats it called, its expanding box when you hover or click the link
[02:24:03] <skylamer`> how to render multiple json data request on to templatez together, without the 'newer' to replace others? :)
[02:24:09] <skylamer`> with getJSON
[02:24:43] <jarr0dsz> if there is such a thing out of the box for http://corp.badoo.com/news/blog/ that language selector i would love to know any experts here might know ;p
[02:27:14] <Xotix> How do i get an HtmlObject to a string?
[02:27:46] <tijko> hey
[02:28:52] <tijko> when using jquery script in template
[02:29:49] <tijko> it is good practice to put the script inside a <body> , yes?
[02:30:20] <xec> jarr0dsz: that looks like a very simple popup, shouldn't even need javascript for that
[02:30:58] <jarr0dsz> xec: not? just style and a onlick show/hide thingy?
[02:31:42] <xec> jarr0dsz: seeing as you got :hover in css, you can just style it display: none; by default
[02:32:59] <jarr0dsz> xec: okay thats cooll diden't thought of thx thx
[02:33:14] <xec> jarr0dsz: the basic concept: http://jsfiddle.net/YLxJe/
[02:34:06] <jarr0dsz> xec: cool thx
[02:36:59] <Ghan> good morning
[02:37:18] <Ghan> is it possible to run PHP inside jquery function?
[02:38:00] <xec> Ghan: yes and no. you can make an ajax call to a url
[02:38:10] <Ghan> thought so xec
[02:38:22] <Ghan> this runs the php every time
[02:38:23] <Ghan> http://pastebin.com/dHPCUaFC
[02:38:36] <Ghan> but the alert only shows up if the condition is true
[02:39:12] <milligan> Cork, that's a shame. Vertically it's fine .. it's horizontally I need to fix :P
[02:39:57] <xec> Ghan: i can't help you with PHP. what does the rendered HTML look like?
[02:40:18] <Ghan> xec: the PHP is not the issue
[02:40:27] <Ghan> the php simply executes every time
[02:40:34] <AdvoWork> i've got: <span class="editable_unit_price" id="unit_price_513" title="">5</span> and im doing:  alert("unit price:" +  $('span.editable_unit_price').text()  );  but it says nothing at all. Any ideas? Do I need to bring in "this" somehow?
[02:40:34] <xec> every time what?
[02:40:40] <Ghan> even though the condition isn't met
[02:40:52] <xec> what condition
[02:41:01] <Ghan> if ( jQuery("div.status<?php echo $_item->getItemId(); ?>:contains('UPLOAD_FOUND')").length )
[02:41:20] <Ghan> if the status div contains the text UPLOAD_FOUND
[02:41:24] <xec> Ghan: what does the rendered html look like, that's got php in it :P
[02:41:31] <Ghan> yep
[02:42:09] <Ghan> oh.. you want the source
[02:42:11] <xec> yes
[02:43:27] <xec> AdvoWork: do you have multiple spans with that same class?
[02:43:40] <Ghan> http://pastebin.com/tWvWXXrR
[02:44:02] <Ghan> the fact that all that xml is in there means that the php ran
[02:44:13] <Ghan> else i wouldn't be getting those results
[02:44:29] <xec> Ghan: is there a div with the class name "status249" ?
[02:44:35] <Ghan> yup
[02:44:38] <elfrancesco> Hello i don't understand why this little code is working in Firefox and not in IE8  ==> http://jsfiddle.net/SNBLk/8/
[02:44:52] <Ghan> <div class="status249"></div>
[02:44:56] <Ghan> it's emply
[02:44:58] <Ghan> 
[02:45:03] <Ghan> empty even
[02:45:39] <rethus> is jquery themeroller compatible with yui2 ?
[02:45:39] <tijko> heya
[02:45:45] <chris_w> Here's one... my data source contains links which has no http://[domain] in it.     I can find the a's in the text ( newsItem.find('a') ) , but how could I find them without containing 'http://'  ?
[02:46:00] <xec> Ghan: what does it return if you run it in console? jQuery("div.status249:contains('UPLOAD_FOUND')").length
[02:46:19] <Ghan> how do i run it in the console?
[02:46:37] <xec> Ghan: do you have firebug? or chrome?
[02:46:43] <Ghan> chrome
[02:46:48] <Ghan> console tab?
[02:46:51] <xec> right
[02:47:11] <Ghan> didn't know you could write in there :D
[02:47:13] <xec> :)
[02:47:19] <AdvoWork> xec, possibly, but they all have a different id
[02:47:26] <rethus> is jquery themeroller compatible with yui2 ?
[02:47:27] <Ghan> returns 0 xec
[02:47:46] <elfrancesco> my code only display the first alert msg in IE wether it display both in Firefox (http://jsfiddle.net/SNBLk/8/) could someone give me a hint on what is wrong please ?
[02:47:48] <tijko> exit
[02:47:59] <xec> AdvoWork: ok, but you're selecting on the class?
[02:48:38] <xec> Ghan: that's what you expected, right?
[02:48:44] <Ghan> yup
[02:48:47] <Ghan> condition isn't met
[02:48:59] <Ghan> so the php shouldn't execute
[02:49:10] <Ghan> cause it's in the if statement
[02:49:10] <xec> ah.. ha
[02:49:14] <xec> well
[02:49:28] <xec> the php is not going to bother looking at your javascript
[02:49:35] <Ghan> ah ha!
[02:49:53] <xec> it's running in a completely different environment
[02:49:59] <Ghan> so i do need to put it in another file
[02:50:26] <xec> if you want to run or not run something on server side, you are going to have to do the check on server side too
[02:51:00] <Ghan> or have jquery do invoke the php file if a certain condition is met
[02:51:14] <xec> that could work too
[02:51:50] <AdvoWork> xec, the thing is, i don't know the specific id, thats what im trying to get?
[02:51:56] <AdvoWork> ive tried this.id but it shows as blank
[02:52:07] <chris_w>  Can someone check my eyes please... would this find any a tags with out the string 'http://' in the href attr?  : newsItem.find("a[href^='http://']")
[02:52:12] <Ghan> an ajax post request
[02:52:32] <xec> AdvoWork: what is the context?
[02:54:09] <milligan> Cork, width:"auto" did the job.
[02:54:11] <xec> chris_w: looks right to me, assuming it exists inside newsItem somewhere
[02:54:36] <chris_w> xec, yea, does to me too :/
[02:55:03] <xec> chris_w: you might want to try swapping the quotes though
[02:55:10] <chris_w> rly?
[02:55:13] <chris_w> hmm
[02:55:19] <xec> $('[attribute^="value"]') <-- the way i usually do it
[02:55:24] <xec> dunno if it makes a difference
[02:55:57] <AdvoWork> xec, basically im using datatables, a column entry is at 0 to begin with. I edit this using jeditable and set it to say 555. Onsubmit/edit of this im trying to get the actual entered value which is the problem. Inspect elementshows: <span class="editable_unit_price" id="unit_price_513" title="">555</span> but I can't for the life of me get 555 :S
[02:57:29] <xec> AdvoWork: i'm gonna be afk a bit, could you make a fiddle containing the markup?
[02:58:34] <ThemNuts> sup guys, i got this tiny little jquery where i want to take the input value (before posting) and put it in between a url like http://www.mysite.com/index.php?search= .....  &list=true . I can get the link to show up correctly but not the var ->http://pastebin.com/cV9SaprT
[02:58:37] <elfrancesco> could someone help me please ? http://jsfiddle.net/SNBLk/8/
[02:58:56] <chris_w> xec, :: newsItem.find('a[href^="http://"]').each(function(){ this.href = this.href.prepend("http://domain.com"); });
[02:59:41] <xec> chris_w: you want the opposite, don't you? the links that *do not* start with http ?
[02:59:50] <chris_w> umm yes..
[02:59:58] <chris_w> Is that not what ^= is ? :)
[03:00:15] <xec> ^= means "starts with"
[03:00:20] <chris_w> Crap yes
[03:00:29] <chris_w> wasn't thinking in regex
[03:01:54] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[03:02:02] <xec> *afk*
[03:11:08] <chris_w> xec, thanks' worked a treat
[03:14:45] <TheKaiser> hey
[03:15:01] <TheKaiser> any idea how I can use appendto with a draggable and droppable?
[03:15:21] <rethus> ha jqueryui a grid-layout like yui ?
[03:15:47] <TheKaiser> yeah
[03:16:07] <TheKaiser> http://www.chakaroff.com/vos/ here's what I'm playing around with
[03:16:09] <rethus> where can i get infos about it?
[03:16:28] <rethus> TheKaiser: you mean me?
[03:20:05] <chris_w> Does JQuery affect urls?  I've got a data source containing something like " <a href='/folder/folder/page'> " , when I find the a hre'fs that are missing "http://" in the href,  and loop around those, it's prepended the baseuri to the url!
[03:25:48] <chris_w> I'm able to re-create the problem here
[03:25:49] <chris_w> http://jsfiddle.net/Ndj2w/
[03:26:18] <chris_w> At what point is the baseuri being injected to the link?
[03:29:06] <slashwalker> hi
[03:31:27] <slashwalker> I have a small issue with ui.tabs
[03:31:44] <slashwalker> $("#featured > ul").tabs({fx:{opacity: "toggle",duration:"fast"}}).tabs("rotate", 7000, true);
[03:32:18] <slashwalker> this works with jquery 1.6.2 and jqueryui 1.5.3 but not with latest of both
[03:32:36] <slashwalker> tabs don't rotate
[03:33:07] <slashwalker> no error/warning in console
[03:35:15] <bonhoeffer> i'm just trying to get some json in the console $.getJSON('http://api.nytimes.com/svc/politics/v3/us/legislative/congress/members/house/CO/2/current.json?api-key=1234') gives me XMLHttpRequest cannot load error
[03:35:28] <bonhoeffer> i thought newer jquery had jsonp support
[03:36:40] <coldhead> it does have jsonp support
[03:36:46] <coldhead> it's just not all jsonp all the time
[03:37:01] <coldhead> you have to specify jsonp
[03:37:21] <bonhoeffer> got it -- thanks -- is there an example you can point me to?
[03:37:40] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[03:37:54] <slashwalker> http://2012.fusionality.de/example1.html
[03:37:57] <slashwalker> works
[03:37:58] <bonhoeffer> thanks
[03:37:59] <slashwalker> http://2012.fusionality.de/example2.html
[03:38:04] <slashwalker> not
[03:38:26] <slashwalker> only differences are the versions of jquery/jqueryui
[03:38:44] <slashwalker> http://2012.fusionality.de/example.html instead of http://2012.fusionality.de/example1.html
[03:40:42] <bonhoeffer> coldhead -- so it is just a matter of appending "callback=?" to the query string?
[03:40:51] <coldhead> bonhoeffer: hopefully!
[03:40:54] <coldhead> ?tias
[03:41:04] <coldhead> oh, no bot :(
[03:41:21] <coldhead> bonhoeffer: if you need to do anything trickier or if that doesn't work see ajax()
[03:41:26] <coldhead> and do it manually
[03:41:40] <coldhead> slashwalker: i don't see any difference
[03:41:47] <coldhead> they both work for me as far as i know
[03:41:54] <bonhoeffer> got it --i'm just trying to do the most basic request
[03:42:21] <bonhoeffer> i can get the json response over http
[03:42:28] <bonhoeffer> but not from the chrome console
[03:42:42] <bonhoeffer> i want to play with the json before putting it in the code
[03:44:28] <bonhoeffer> and adding callback doesn't get me there .  .
[03:45:12] <coldhead> either the docs are lying or you are doing it wrong
[03:45:22] <coldhead> i would try ajax() instead of getjson
[03:45:40] <coldhead> because there you can set dataType: 'jsonp'
[03:45:44] <coldhead> which really does work
[03:45:56] <coldhead> unlike a magic word on the end of your URL
[03:46:01] <coldhead> oh unless...
[03:46:12] <coldhead> did you try callback=someCallBack?
[03:46:32] <coldhead> or whatever the name of the callback is that the remote server expects?
[03:46:39] <slashwalker> coldhead the difference is only jquery 1.6.2 vs 1.7.1 and jqueryui 1.5.3 vs 1.8.18
[03:47:18] <coldhead> slashwalker: i don't see any difference in the way they work
[03:47:23] <slashwalker> for me the example2.html doesn't work, the arrow doesn't switch to aktive tab neither in firefox nor in chrome
[03:47:24] <coldhead> they both "work" as far as i can see
[03:47:45] <coldhead> the arrow doesn't switch to active tab?
[03:47:53] <coldhead> you should have mentioned this before!
[03:47:59] <coldhead> i have to sleep now
[03:48:05] <coldhead> good luck slashwalker
[03:48:16] <slashwalker> thx
[03:48:40] <slashwalker> i looked into firebug and the tabs don't change

[04:23:49] <mikkelb> I apologize in advance for the messy HTML!
[04:24:03] <elfrancesco> i have troubles with this code http://jsfiddle.net/SNBLk/9/ <== i don't why but only the First Alert message is displayed in IE wether 2 are displayed in Firefox... thanks by advance of any help
[04:25:35] <Whitez> elfrancesco: Check what $('param[value="\"/_catalogs/masterpage/Sdis72.SharePoint.Silverlight.Coverflow.xap\""]') is on both browsers
[04:26:17] <elfrancesco> in fact Whitez in firefox its a jquery object with length = 1 whereas in IE it is an empty object :/
[04:26:37] <elfrancesco> but i don't understand why it would be different  Whitez
[04:28:55] <Whitez> elfrancesco: It displays on IE9
[04:29:20] <elfrancesco> ha ok i tried it on IE8

[04:32:06] <iman> hi, how can I remove all div's content and make it empty
[04:32:07] <iman> ?
[04:32:13] <elfrancesco> Whitez: it just don't work either i tried adding the backslash after seeing it not working without
[04:33:43] <elfrancesco> iman maybe something like $("div").text("")
[04:34:05] <iman> or something like  $("div").empty();
[04:34:08] <iman>  ?
[04:34:25] <elfrancesco> didn't knew about the empty function
[04:34:51] <mukmuk> i want to trigger a switch-command, but just when i outcomment it, the whole script doenst work; here is a code snippet of the html: http://pastebin.com/BJ3N8Qpy
[04:35:09] <Whitez> elfrancesco: Don't know, but try a space before the />
[04:36:10] <Robbington> Hi, can anyone offer some advice on how to acces a jquery plug in events and methods?
[04:36:33] <elfrancesco> iman as i read empty will remove child in your div if it is what you want
[04:36:48] <Cork> Robbington: that question you need to specify quite a bit
[04:37:25] <iman> elfrancesco, i'm trying it out, thanks
[04:38:29] <jita> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9471229/scripts-stop-working-after-jquery-replacewith
[04:38:30] <jita> any help ?
[04:39:34] <Robbington> Cork: Well lets say I have a plug in with a scroller, I want watch for the scroller event
[04:39:58] <Cork> jita: could you make a live demo in jsfiddle?
[04:40:18] <Cork> jita: it would be good to at least see what id's you have and where
[04:40:20] <Robbington> and the scroller has a click event to move the image to the left or right, but I want to fire that method on the click my own element.
[04:40:48] <codespectator> has anyone had any experience with append removing the div in question?
[04:40:59] <Cork> Robbington: only if they use trigger or _trigger can you handle them as events
[04:41:04] <codespectator> so for exampel $('div#test').appendTo('some stuff');
[04:41:28] <codespectator> it runs a few times and then $('div#test') gets removed from the dom
[04:41:51] <antgel_> hi, really having a problem with jquery ui accordion.  i want to change the content upon (some event).  so i call $('#accordion').html(new content); $('#accordion').accordion();, the new html is added but the .accordion call doesn't seem to work. any clues?  pulling my hair out
[04:42:21] <Cork> codespectator: appendTo appends div#text TO the element you have there
[04:42:29] <Cork> codespectator: your sure you don't want append ?
[04:43:43] <jita> CORALZX, http://jsfiddle.net/RxcFF/1/
[04:44:06] <CORALZX> WAT
[04:44:08] <CORALZX> LULZ
[04:44:21] <chrleon> http://jsfiddle.net/RVTg4/ - trying to wrap groups of h2 p inside a div. I know h2 + p is wrong, but how can I group every h2 and the following p inside their own div(s)?
[04:45:45] <Cork> jita: what code fails?
[04:47:35] <jita> Cork, after replacewith, the events bound to the refreshed division stop working. I have to getScript again in order to bind the events again to the refreshed DOM
[04:48:03] <Cork> jita: you mean the form change event?
[04:48:08] <jita> Cork, yeah
[04:48:13] <Cork> ...
[04:49:03] <jita> Cork, #filter-results is the division which contain the list of feedbacks, and on each each feedback there is soundmanager plugin and jquery ui are bound
[04:49:20] <Cork> jita: i have no idea why that would happen
[04:49:31] <Cork> looks completly unreasonable
[04:49:50] <jita> Cork, yeah but it works if i use getScript again :(
[04:50:20] <jita> Cork, there are jquery ui dialogs, which stop working too
[04:50:51] <Cork> jita: the only explanation i can find is that you somehow replace the form
[04:50:52] <jita> Cork, this is the complete filter.js file http://tmai.cloudshuffle.com/static/js/filter.js
[04:52:17] <jita> Cork, in this file although the live is working not 'on' but the result is the same
[04:52:44] <jita> Cork, i can provide you the live page if you are willing to have a look ?
[04:52:56] <Cork> jita: check the generated dom so you don't get duplicat id's or something like that
[04:53:00] <Cork> sure
[04:53:20] <jita> Cork, http://tmai.cloudshuffle.com/business/feedbacks/
[04:54:42] <jita> Cork, currently it is working because i have used getScript after the division refreshing, if i remove that, it stops working
[04:54:58] <jita> Cork, try changing some form field in the left form
[04:55:14] <Cork> uh.. you mean i have to create an account or?
[04:55:47] <antgel_> hi, would be so happy if someone could look at http://jsfiddle.net/jFBXy/1/?  it doesn't seem to work in jsfiddle but does in my browser.  the problem is that the accordion doesn't get recreated in the browser, just the html gets changed.  :(  in jsfiddle the accordion doesn't even get changed
[04:55:54] <jita> Cork, no i sent you the credentials
[04:56:05] <jita> Cork, in the pm, didn't you get it ?
[04:56:18] <Cork> no i have pm disabled
[04:56:33] <jita> Cork, ok its ron@45sec.com and password: ron
[04:58:00] <Cork> jita: wheres the form located?
[04:58:07] <Cork> (the form tag)
[04:58:29] <jita> Cork, the left side of the page, where we have Category, get Back fields
[04:58:48] <jita> Cork, try setting, get back to No
[04:59:52] <D4> Hm, is console.log() rather expensive to use?
[05:00:14] <Cork> jita: nope can't give you a good answer for that one
[05:00:28] <jita> Cork, ok no problem, thanks for trying
[05:00:45] <Cork> would have to disect the page heavily, and i don't have time for that
[05:00:56] <Cork> nasty bug though
[05:00:58] <jita> Cork, no problem
[05:01:00] <Cork> good luck
[05:01:04] <jita> thanks
[05:01:17] <D4> I mean, debugging with a lot of console.log() seems to slow down the script, when removing them it seems as it's faster (not that I'm going to have console.log() when I'm done debugging) but still.
[05:02:12] <JillesCode> Hey phpAlex is here =O
[05:02:54] <Cork> D4: that depends from implementation
[05:03:10] <Cork> D4: i can't say i've seen any slowdown though
[05:03:29] <jita> Cork, can you tell me how to dissect the DOM and all, so that i could try to debug on my own ?
[05:04:00] <Cork> jita: try to make a separat testcase, without network calls
[05:04:28] <Cork> and try to find what exact combinations cause the events bound on document to be removed
[05:04:50] <Cork> another thing might be to see if the event is actually removed, or if the selector just doens't match
[05:05:24] <jita> Cork, the selector is same as because the page that gets refreshed is the same which used to serve the original document
[05:05:49] <Robbington> Cork: Just using the content flow plug in, it lists the event methods, just unsure how to fire them with my own code http://www.jacksasylum.eu/ContentFlow/docu.php
[05:05:55] <jita> Cork, Is there a way to find all the events in the document currently attached to the document, after the ajax call ?
[05:06:18] <Cork> jita: try running the selector and see if it still match for example
[05:06:25] <Cork> after the update withot the fix
[05:06:45] <jita> Cork, ok
[05:06:46] <Cork> jita: yes, $._data(document, 'events')
[05:07:05] <jita> Cork, ok thanks i will try that now
[05:07:40] <Cork> Robbington: you have a none minimized version of content flow?
[05:09:35] <g[r]eek> Hey fellas. How do I get the value of a specific attribute of the last li in my ul of id #moo? Thanks
[05:10:07] <Cork> $('#moo li:last').attr('specific')
[05:10:49] <g[r]eek> Cork++
[05:10:53] <Cork> of $('#moo > li:last').attr('specific') if its multi leveld
[05:11:06] <Cork> of==or
[05:12:28] <ShawnRisk> how come my multi-step form is not working here: http://wadevs.com/attributes.html but is working here: http://jsfiddle.net/LKt4G/3/ ?
[05:13:36] <Zogot> ShawnRisk: add e.preventDefault
[05:13:39] <Zogot> to click
[05:13:41] <Zogot> would that do it?
[05:13:45] <Cork> ShawnRisk: your not waiting for domready
[05:13:48] <Robbington> cork: No I couldnt find one
[05:14:00] <Cork> $('.next-link') won't match anything
[05:14:31] <Cork> Robbington: i don't know the lib so can't really tell what event it triggers, sorry
[05:14:54] <Cork> ShawnRisk: so wrap your script in head with $(function() {});
[05:15:08] <Robbington> Cork: thats ok, getting there slowly.
[05:15:17] <jita> Cork, When some division gets its content replaceWith using ajax, can i do something like $('#dynamic_division').on('change') { .... } ?
[05:15:25] <miket3> shawn
[05:15:34] <jita> Cork, in order to retain its events
[05:15:49] <Cork> jita: when you use on the event in the selector needs to be constant
[05:16:11] <Cork> the first argument is the event, and then you add the selector you want to use for the "live" event
[05:16:18] <jita> Cork, 'change' here signifies that the html contents has been replaced in the division
[05:16:31] <Cork> ah, no you can't
[05:16:38] <Cork> change is for form element
[05:16:44] <Cork> not dom changes
[05:16:57] <jita> Cork, so here lies my problem
[05:17:28] <jita> Cork, I want to retain the events attached to the #feedback-results division, after they got refreshed
[05:17:47] <jita> Cork, not on the form itself
[05:17:57] <ShawnRisk> miket3: yes?
[05:18:50] <jita> Cork, because changing form triggers some other division to be refreshed, in my case it has a side effect on #feedback-results, which contains the list of feedbacks, and each feedback has soundmanger plugin and jquery ui dialog attached to it, which stop working
[05:19:15] <Cork> jita: $('form input').live('change') === $(document).on('change', 'form input')
[05:19:44] <ShawnRisk> Cork: I tried the $(function() { });  locally but that didn't work out.
[05:20:00] <Cork> ShawnRisk: didn't work out?
[05:20:16] <ShawnRisk> Cork: still the same as before, the next button still is not working
[05:20:39] <ShawnRisk> I did $(function() { $('.next-link').click(function () { }); });
[05:20:44] <jita> Cork, yes
[05:21:01] <Cork> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/LKt4G/4/
[05:21:23] <Cork> ShawnRisk: notice the change in the select box on the left
[05:21:24] <walidvb> hi!
[05:21:45] <jita> Cork, but this means that if change happens to the form, retain the events attached to the form in the DOM; what i want if change happens in the form, retain the events in #filter-results division. You getting me ?
[05:21:56] <walidvb> i'm really bad at regex, and i need smth that checks that my last expression on location.pathname is blog
[05:22:02] <walidvb> how can i do that?
[05:22:18] <Cork> jita: no
[05:22:28] <TFTF> $('summary').live('click', function() { ... }) - inside the function I want to 1. call the native event, 2. do something based on that event (read open status).
[05:22:36] <Cork> jita: the live and on example there attach the events to document
[05:22:37] <TFTF> How can I trigger the native event?
[05:23:07] <ShawnRisk> Cork: no I don't actually
[05:23:14] <Cork> TFTF: you can't trigger the default action from js if thats what you want
[05:23:27] <Cork> ShawnRisk: your old pb used onLoad
[05:23:33] <jita> Cork, so it should work even any division of the document gets refreshed ?
[05:23:49] <Cork> ShawnRisk: but your other site used head, the code from fiddle /4 should work the same on your page
[05:23:51] <ShawnRisk> Cork: there
[05:24:07] <Cork> jita: yes
[05:24:20] <Cork> jita: as long as the page isn't replaced
[05:24:26] <Cork> (aka a reload)
[05:24:34] <jita> Cork, nope that isn't the case
[05:24:39] <ShawnRisk> Cork: yes it is working in jsfiddle but how do I make this work on a normal page?
[05:24:58] <elfrancesco> http://jsfiddle.net/SNBLk/15/ <== i don't manage to understand why this selector works in Firefox but not in IE8 if someone have a workaround....?
[05:25:05] <TFTF> Cork: thanks for the answer
[05:25:24] <Cork> ShawnRisk: by making it look like in the last fiddle version
[05:25:33] <tooter> hey folks - using jquery mobile - how can i detect the end position of a swipe event, or should i rather look at the vmouse* events?
[05:25:42] <walidvb> i'm really bad at regex, and i need smth that checks that my last expression on location.pathname is blog
[05:25:44] <Cork> ShawnRisk: the reason it didn't work before was cause the code in fiddle depended on onload
[05:26:02] <Cork> ShawnRisk: /4 doesn't
[05:26:16] <jita> Cork, back to square one, thought that i found the problem for one sec :(
[05:27:01] <JackBauer24> walidvb: http://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html
[05:27:23] <ShawnRisk> Cork: you are right
[05:27:29] <walidvb> JackBauer24: argh i read this several times, with no success :(
[05:27:44] <walidvb> but thx for the link, maybe i need one more try
[05:28:16] <JackBauer24> walidvb: what regexp did you make?
[05:28:24] <miket3> elfrancesco, we should all pick a day to stop working around IE and and force the world to use other browsers
[05:28:35] <walidvb> hm well.. none that give smth..
[05:28:48] <walidvb> basically i want the whole word after the last /
[05:30:00] <Cork> walidvb: what do you mean with last expresion?
[05:30:25] <Cork> you mean like a path/some/blog ?
[05:30:37] <walidvb> well location.pathname is plak/blog or plak/catalog
[05:30:46] <walidvb> i want to check which it is
[05:31:04] <Cork> so just that the path ends with log?
[05:31:19] <miket3> In fact starting today I declare that Dec 21 2012 as the day we all add  [!-- IF IE --] Use FF
[05:31:23] <JackBauer24> walidvb: /blog$/
[05:31:27] <JackBauer24> it's as simple as that
[05:32:15] <miket3> Then starting in 2013 all our code can be 30% smaller
[05:32:41] <walidvb> JackBauer24: thank you very much
[05:32:53] <elfrancesco> http://jsfiddle.net/SNBLk/15/ <== i don't manage to understand why this selector works in Firefox but not in IE8 if someone have a workaround....?
[05:32:53] <walidvb> i'll try palying around a bit with that to understand better
[05:32:57] <Cork> walidvb: so in other words window.location.pathname.test(/blog$/)
[05:33:41] <Cork> walidvb: or just window.location.pathname.substr(-4) === 'blog') :D
[05:34:26] <walidvb> Cork: that's the thing i want to avoid hardcoding the first 4 characters
[05:34:33] <Cork> :)
[05:34:45] <Cork> its not the first though
[05:34:53] <Cork> and the regex does the same thing
[05:34:56] <walidvb> but this would simply test if 'blog' is contained in the string?
[05:35:12] <Cork> no it checks that blog is the last in the string
[05:35:31] <walidvb> hm i might have hashtags following..
[05:35:35] <Cork> window.location.pathname.substr(-4) === 'blog' and window.location.pathname.test(/blog$/) does basically the exact same thing
[05:35:42] <Cork> not in pathname
[05:35:46] <ShawnRisk> Cork: what if I want to add a previous link?
[05:35:49] <Cork> thats location.hash
[05:36:02] <walidvb> Cork: but then if my path is asdasdasd/blog it won't work
[05:36:13] <walidvb> Cork: true, location.pathname removes the hashtag
[05:36:26] <Xotix> hi
[05:36:26] <AdvoWork> I'm doing: var vendor_item_id = this.id; and then: alert("vendor_item_id:"+vendor_item_id); which shows: vendor_item_id:unit_price_513 following by a simple replace: vendor_item_id = vendor_item_id.replace("unit_price_","");  but it gives the error Uncaught TypeError: Object 264 has no method 'replace'. Any ideas please?
[05:36:32] <Cork> ShawnRisk: use the prev id?
[05:36:40] <Cork> just revert it one step
[05:37:18] <walidvb> hm Object /plak/blog has no method 'test'
[05:37:43] <Cork> hmm pathname isn't a string??
[05:37:45] * Cork checks
[05:38:14] <ShawnRisk> Cork: yes but how?  I tried with .previous but didn't work
[05:38:32] <sahbeewah> do /blog\/?$/.test(window.location.pathname)
[05:38:55] <Cork> ya test takes the string
[05:39:49] <walidvb> sahbeewah: ok lemme try
[05:40:05] <walidvb> sahbeewah: great it's working :)
[05:40:07] <walidvb> thank you!
[05:40:12] <Xotix> How can i get the width of an image? Not the calculated width caused by sorrounding elmeents or brwoser defaults but the width set by external css, js, internal css or the old width tags. same width height
[05:40:13] <miket3> elfrancesco, just an idea....  try to setup param with class="myparam"  then use the class selector
[05:41:23] <Frippuz> for some reason IE8 doesn't update the contents of a div after a .hmtl("contens") call, it works in any other browser. it WILL thou update the div if I click on it - any ideas?
[05:42:07] <Xotix> Frippuz:  maybe ie doesn't support the event?
[05:43:22] <Frippuz> Xotix: I'm using the cycle plugin. This call is made in a onAfter event. I want to update a div with text -should be simple, but not in IE8
[05:43:49] <ShawnRisk> Cork: How come this code is not working: $('.previous-link').click(function () { $(this).parent() .addClass('step1') .prev('fieldset') .removeClass('step'); });  .step { display: none; } .step1 { display: block; }
[05:44:16] <Xotix> Ie is a bitch anyway. Hav you done a console.log or alert to make sure it gets triggered?
[05:45:11] <elfrancesco> miket3: i don't have the possibility to modify the HTML :(
[05:45:38] <elfrancesco> miket3: seems to work better with using the attr() function
[05:46:06] <Frippuz> Xotix: the code: http://pastebin.com/vrxFLzBe
[05:49:17] <Cork> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/LKt4G/7/
[05:49:47] <ShawnRisk> Cork: thanks
[05:49:56] <Cork> heck even http://jsfiddle.net/LKt4G/8/ would work
[05:50:03] <NoReGreT> can someone help here, http://pastie.org/3541219 the dynamically created emailField isn't detecting the keypress event, what could be wrong here
[05:50:11] <Xotix> Frippuz don't know why ie8 should have a problem with that.
[05:51:23] <Frippuz> Xotix: exactly my point. The text is loaded into the divs, but only after I click on the div itself. I know IE8 runs the onAfter function.
[05:52:31] <Frippuz> Xotix: and it works fine in IE9, FF and even on several phones
[05:52:33] <ShawnRisk> Cork: is this reloading the page, or doing ajax?
[05:52:51] <Cork> ShawnRisk: neither
[05:52:58] <Cork> it just shows and hides elements
[05:53:20] <Cork> btw i added the non-js fallback i talked about before
[05:53:41] <Xotix> Frippuz:  your ie8 got default settings? I don't know why it behaves liek that, you need to wait till someone else of the chat will help you. Or as kstackoverflow maybe.  sry
[05:54:25] <ShawnRisk> Cork: who is that directed towards?
[05:54:45] <Frippuz> Xotix: Its been tested on several computers with IE8, all the same. Wele, thanx 4 trying - I appreciate it
[05:55:46] <Xotix> Frippuz: Does the event get triggered on click or does it just "finish the update" on click?
[05:57:22] <Frippuz> Xotix: the event fires as it should, just updates. I've checked in IEs debug tool - tried a alert()statement to check the contents of the div after the line of code has been run. There it prints the correct text - but its not visible on the page
[05:59:04] <Xotix> hmm, strange. I'd ask stackoverflow.com or write an mail to the developer.
[06:01:44] <pi3r> hi guys
[06:02:07] <AdvoWork> I'm doing: var vendor_item_id = this.id; and then: alert("vendor_item_id:"+vendor_item_id); which shows: vendor_item_id:unit_price_513 following by a simple replace: vendor_item_id = vendor_item_id.replace("unit_price_","");  but it gives the error Uncaught TypeError: Object 264 has no method 'replace'. Any ideas please?
[06:02:07] <pi3r> i'am looking for a way to display (n) numbers of tr in a table
[06:02:26] <pi3r> like "table tr".first(3)
[06:02:37] <AdvoWork> pi3r, can you not do: $('id_of_tr's').length ?
[06:02:52] <AdvoWork> or '#ids..
[06:03:15] <pi3r> AdvoWork, i'm just wondering if it's possible using jquery
[06:03:28] <pi3r> to say tak the first (n) that matches
[06:03:48] <pi3r>  s/tak/take
[06:04:14] <erichynds> pi3r: slice()
[06:05:43] <pi3r> erichynds, thanks, let me try that
[06:08:31] <oxez__> Anyone know if there are current issues with Firefox (10.x) regarding scrolling + changing window.location.hash ? Like here: http://oxez.net/test.html , if I scroll down until I see the red rectangle, firefox's screen flickers when the hash changes. Is it a browser specific issue or is there something I can do about that in my code?
[06:08:42] <Xotix> how can i make $post() open a new window?
[06:09:49] <Larholm> Xotix, use a <form target="_blank">
[06:09:54] <Larholm> call form.submit()
[06:10:20] <Larholm> $.post uses XHR to send a POST request, but that's not the same as a form post unless you explicitly define the headers
[06:11:15] <Xotix> ah ok thanks
[06:11:20] <NoReGreT> can someone help here, http://pastie.org/3541219 the dynamically created emailField isn't detecting the keypress event, what could be wrong here
[06:14:49] <ShawnRisk> Cork: still around?
[06:17:22] <rroelofs> NoReGreT: typically it is because you are binding the event handler before the element exists
[06:17:53] <rroelofs> your pastie doesn't include enough code to be sure.
[06:18:11] <rroelofs> jsFiddle lets you create working examples which is often more helpful
[06:18:56] <NoReGreT> rroelofs: but i'm using .on() which according to the docs, binds stuff in the future
[06:19:40] <oxez__> Fixed my problem with a setTimeout of 1 ms, weird.
[06:19:59] <rroelofs> NoReGreT: yes but 'on' has several variaations and I can't tell if the .EmailField exists when on is called
[06:20:31] <NoReGreT> it does exist
[06:20:37] <NoReGreT> i'll try to create an example
[06:21:20] <AdvoWork> I'm doing: var vendor_item_id = this.id; and then: alert("vendor_item_id:"+vendor_item_id); which shows: vendor_item_id:unit_price_513 following by a simple replace: vendor_item_id = vendor_item_id.replace("unit_price_","");  but it gives the error Uncaught TypeError: Object 264 has no method 'replace'. Any ideas please?
[06:21:28] <Zogot> NoReGreT: Unlike using on for click or anything that already exists in the DOM if you wish to attach it to elements that are yet to be made you need to use .on on an element that the object is going into
[06:21:33] <Zogot> not the object itself
[06:22:10] <Zogot> example .on('#container','div', function() )
[06:22:18] <Zogot> instead of on('div', function())
[06:23:14] <NoReGreT> Zogot: i'm aware of that, and that's what i'm doing
[06:23:39] <NoReGreT> im not having issues with .on() as it worked fine with me on other dynamically created content before
[06:24:07] <NoReGreT> when binded with click/mouseenter, i had no problems
[06:24:18] <NoReGreT> except in this case, which i have no idea what hte problem is
[06:25:29] <JAAulde> mekwall: ping
[06:26:12] <NoReGreT> that is the content on the dom, http://pastie.org/3541219
[06:27:08] <mekwall> JAAulde, pong
[06:27:46] <JAAulde> mekwall: ahoy! It was recommended that I use your jQuery notification plugin. DId you see my mentions here in the chan yesterday?
[06:28:09] <jack__> hi
[06:28:19] * JAAulde waves at jack__
[06:28:20] <mekwall> JAAulde, too much activity in this channel so the logs only go back a couple of hours :P
[06:28:31] <jack__> how do i in jquery look up some text inside a span
[06:28:33] <JAAulde> mekwall: sure, understood. Is that project still viable?
[06:28:34] <mekwall> JAAulde, I haven't updated that plugin for ages :)
[06:28:35] <Zogot> NoReGreT: Is there any reason your not using a form for this?
[06:28:41] <JAAulde> ha, yeah
[06:28:43] <rroelofs> NoReGreT: I think your .on is in the wrong order.
[06:28:43] <jack__> and if it is something replace it with something else
[06:29:03] <mekwall> JAAulde, no idea. only way to find out is to try it I guess :D
[06:29:21] <jack__> text inside a siv is ok took
[06:29:42] <JAAulde> mekwall: I was considering forking and working with it. I was hoping you could make that a bit simpler for me though...in github your source file AND your min file are minfiied, and your docs/demo page is down
[06:29:52] <em0vskangoura_> Hello guys, how could i pass multiple data with POST with $.ajax() function? I tried something like this data: { data1 : data1, data2 : data2 } but it doesnt seem to work :S
[06:30:14] <Zogot> NoReGreT: If you just use a normal form, enter submits
[06:30:24] <JAAulde> mekwall: can you provide me acess to an unminified version to save me reformatting, and/or can you link me some docs/demos so I can see expected behaviors?
[06:30:32] <Zogot> NoReGreT: and then you can e.preventDefault if you want it to only work with ajax
[06:30:53] <z3yo> Hi there
[06:31:12] <em0vskangoura_> Any other way? Because its a module on Drupal etc etc and dunno if that one will work
[06:31:16] <Zogot> NoReGreT: will also mean you can put that JS in a file as you can get the forms action as the path instead of writing the js in a php file
[06:31:26] <z3yo> I just want to know, on() can be used as the "new" live() right ?
[06:31:35] <Zogot> yep z3yo
[06:32:38] <z3yo> Zogot, so why my old ".live("result",function() ? " that worked, doesnt work with "on("result",function()..."
[06:33:04] <Zogot> live needs to be bound to the surrounding jquery object
[06:33:26] <Zogot> not the class that you are expecting
[06:33:48] <Zogot> $('#container').on('click', 'div', function())
[06:35:09] <z3yo> Oh alright I got it, thx Zogot  ;)
[06:35:51] <slashwalker> any idea why http://2012.fusionality.de/example.html works and http://2012.fusionality.de/example2.html not? In example2, the tabs don't rotate only diff are the jquery/jqueryui versions
[06:36:19] <ShawnRisk> How do I change css based on the link I click?  I am doing this: $(function() { $('.next-link, .prev-link').click(function () { $('.step').hide() $($(this).attr('href')).show(); }); });
[06:38:49] <JAAulde> Hmm, Filament Group's site is down
[06:39:08] <JackBauer24> ShawnRisk: just use $(this).css() in event handler function
[06:39:21] <jita> Cork, there ?
[06:39:27] <mekwall> JAAulde, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/Md98w/
[06:39:53] <mekwall> JAAulde, aah... that one includes the minified... hold on
[06:40:07] <mekwall> JAAulde, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/LzgX8/
[06:40:38] <JAAulde> mekwall: super, thanks!
[06:40:57] <ShawnRisk> JackBauer24: that is right, but what if I am targeting other text like this: http://jsfiddle.net/LKt4G/9/
[06:41:11] <JAAulde> mekwall: I will probably fork it on github.  Do you want contributions back in pull requests? or is that project considered dead t you?
[06:41:39] <AdvoWork> I've got some code that appears to be working, but is throwing an error in my jquery code: its hitting this throw catch (e) { throw e; } finally { fired = [ context, args ]; firing = 0; }  is there anything I can do about that, and do I have to be worried about it?
[06:41:49] <ShawnRisk> What I want to do is if I am in Step 1, the Step 1 be highlighted, and if in Step 2, the Step 2 be highlighted but not step 1.
[06:42:41] <JackBauer24> ShawnRisk: "id" attribute must be unique for each element
[06:42:51] <JackBauer24> you can't use the same ID for multiple elements
[06:43:05] <JackBauer24> use "class" or "rel" instead
[06:43:29] <ShawnRisk> JackBauer24: right I was just testing this, but I do have class="step1", class="step2", class="step3",
[06:43:39] <LoreVTEC> hello. can someone tell me why this div is not fading in? http://jsfiddle.net/lorenzo/TaxUc/2/
[06:44:12] <Seubeu> Hello there does by any chance one of you manage to have a event manager working on a TinyMCE textarea using jQuery ?
[06:44:38] <JAAulde> Seubeu: what's an "event manager"?
[06:44:56] <JackBauer24> ShawnRisk: create a variable which will store the current step number. Increase it/Decrease it when you click on next/prev link
[06:45:03] <Seubeu> I cannot find how to detect any changes in the TinyMCE editor
[06:45:15] <JackBauer24> then you can easily modify CSS of each step
[06:45:16] <JAAulde> Seubeu: ah, I see
[06:45:50] <Zogot> LoreVTEC: something like so? http://jsfiddle.net/KHkbp/5/
[06:46:33] <LoreVTEC> Zogot: I would like to have hw acceleration for mobile :)
[06:47:28] <ShawnRisk> JackBauer24: using for or if statement?
[06:47:53] <JackBauer24> ShawnRisk: if
[06:47:56] <NoReGreT> Zogot: I don't wantn to change things now, as being it a form won't fix the problem neither having code in js file
[06:48:18] <Xotix> is it possible to get the inlien css of an element? and just the inline css. No calculated stuff
[06:49:02] <AdvoWork> anyone know about Jquery exceptions and if a thrown exception is a show stopper or can be ignored?
[06:50:05] <pradev> Hi there
[06:50:11] <pradev> have a doubt
[06:50:27] <Zogot> NoReGreT: Well then your going to need to make an example.  Although if it was a form you could just have those fields part of the form in a div set to display none, have the div to show, and just do a normal ajax submit on enter (which happens in forms) Cutting your code some 15 lines and working easily :p
[06:50:39] <e01> is there way to get event, if some dom element is added from other script
[06:51:11] <ShawnRisk> JackBauer24: I get the step number from the class?  Like from step1?
[06:51:27] <pradev> oh nvm found out.. sorry
[06:51:28] <e01> i mean to add event and callback when new element is created, and one when is removed
[06:56:31] <JackBauer24> ShawnRisk: http://jsfiddle.net/LKt4G/11/ do it like this
[06:58:02] <ShawnRisk> JackBauer24: thanks
[06:58:58] <LoreVTEC> Zogot: do you have any idea why this works but my previous example doesn't? http://jsfiddle.net/lorenzo/TaxUc/3/
[07:00:41] <timwis> Hey guys, I'm trying to query an external domain when a form is submitted via $.getJSON() w/JSONP. When it's done, it submits the form. If, for example, the external web site is down, the form never gets submitted (since the .submit() call was in the 'success' function. Is there a way to make it submit if the external site is down?
[07:01:18] <slashwalker> any idea why $("#featured > ul").tabs({fx:{opacity: "toggle",duration:"fast"}}).tabs("rotate", 7000, true); works with jquery 1.6.2 and jqueryui 1.5.3 but not with jquery 1.7.1 and jquerui 1.8.18?
[07:03:46] <ShawnRisk> JackBauer24: one other thing, how do I set Step1 to have css already?
[07:04:48] <JackBauer24> ShawnRisk: just trigger a proper function outside of the event handler. Look it up in the manual
[07:05:07] <ShawnRisk> JackBauer24: okay
[07:06:03] <BillCriswell> I know this isn't the channel to ask, but I figured I'd try it anyway. Anyone here familiar with Mustache?
[07:12:48] <AdvoWork> anyone know about Jquery exceptions and if a thrown exception is a show stopper or can be ignored?
[07:14:19] <ShawnRisk> JackBauer24: that worked
[07:14:21] <ShawnRisk> thanks
[07:19:34] <jack__> what is that javascript testing site?
[07:20:54] <BillCriswell> jsfiddle?
[07:20:55] <Xotix> jsfiddle.net ?
[07:21:56] <EdwardIII> hey
[07:23:07] <EdwardIII> i've got something 3rd party on a page that i can't edit (a ajax contact form) but i want to trigger some of my code when the form gets submitted successfully
[07:23:52] <timwis> What's to stop a chrome/firefox extension from inserting a js file into every web page, hooking $('form').submit() and doing a JSONP $.ajax of all the $('form input').val() to an external web page that logs the form data (i.e. passwords)?
[07:24:14] * EdwardIII ponders
[07:24:45] <EdwardIII> i can hook the form's submit event easily enough, but as it's an ajax submission i don't see how i can identify whether the validation of the form succeeded and lets me go through or else failed, in which case i don't want my code to exec
[07:25:30] <EdwardIII> i guess i could just watch the area it outputs to for a dom mutation, then when the event mutation occurs check the content, and if it's like "message sent o.k." i could exec my code
[07:25:30] <evo> why do you have a 3rd party contact form on your page in the first place?
[07:25:44] <EdwardIII> evo: this seems to happen a lot working on client's sites where they use stuff like contact form 7
[07:25:57] <timwis> EdwardIII Actually my question had nothing to do with yours, but by coincidence it's related :P I'm working on something very similar it sounds like
[07:26:05] <timwis> (not that I'm working on what I suggested in my question)
[07:26:20] <EdwardIII> timwis: heh, super suspicious!
[07:26:46] <EdwardIII> i don't see what would stop a plugin doing what you're describing
[07:26:57] <smplstk> timwis: people are going to install what they're going to install
[07:27:01] <evo> EdwardIII: can't you doing some simple validation in your own code rather then crawling the dom?
[07:27:04] * smplstk runs virus.bat
[07:27:06] <timwis> lol, i'm actually creating a webhook for an application my company uses, on form submit (since i can't modify the application back-end) but it got me thinking about that potential vulnerability
[07:27:38] <EdwardIII> evo: i'd have to unhook their validation first, then trigger their ajax message sending code afterwards if my validation passed, and i'm not even sure if that's going to be possible?
[07:27:51] <timwis> smplstk, wow, well it seems like it'd be really simple to make that, which could essentially log passwords across the internet
[07:28:10] <EdwardIII> timwis: what method are you you using? the hacky dom-based nastiness i described above?
[07:28:26] <timwis> EdwardIII I'm doing something very similar - I haven't got to that part yet but I assume we could just trigger .submit() and it would trigger the other js events, no?
[07:29:02] <smplstk> timwis: just because somebody creates it doesn't mean everyone is going to install/run it
[07:29:20] <EdwardIII> evo: or... just hook my code, emulate the form's validation and then exec my callback if it does validate? i guess that would be less satanic
[07:29:30] <evo> that's what I was thinking
[07:29:32] <EdwardIII> evo: that's what you're suggesting, right?
[07:29:33] <smplstk> same orgin policy is pretty good when it comes to sandboxing data
[07:29:34] <EdwardIII> cool
[07:29:48] <timwis> EdwardIII for my project I'm adding a .js file to the header. it hooks the $('form#add').submit(), executes an $.ajax() with jsonp, and executes $('form#add').submit() on success or error(timeout)
[07:30:01] <EdwardIII> timwis: well in my case i only want my callback to exec if the form validates, i figure i'll just do what's above ^
[07:30:13] <EdwardIII> timwis: u r hacking the intranet
[07:30:33] <timwis> oh, and you can't modify the validation javascript?
[07:30:39] <EdwardIII> timwis: nup heh
[07:30:44] <EdwardIII> i'll just emulate it
[07:31:21] <timwis> hm, and I guess .submit() is called prior to the validation?
[07:31:37] <timwis> if you could somehow have it  called after the validation..
[07:34:03] <angrywombat> i'm having trouble with a click event for a span class... can anyone take a real brief look and tell me what i'm doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/Yr27iCTQ
[07:34:21] <angrywombat> i'm not very good at this whole javascript thing yet
[07:34:44] <EdwardIII> timwis: yeah, i think, well, i *hope* so heh
[07:35:07] <EdwardIII> well, if i'm running my own validation it becomes irrelavent when it gets executed
[07:35:54] <devc> Hey guys, this is a raw JS problem, but I come here more often so I'm here... I'm trying to clear an array argument passed through a function http://jsfiddle.net/6uPfe/1/
[07:36:36] <devc> My problem is variable scope, I suppose. How do I use the passed array and relate that to the global array I'm hoping to clear?
[07:36:49] <Gozzy> angrywombat put your code in an onload handler and it works
[07:37:29] <Gozzy> http://www.webdevout.net/test?017
[07:38:10] <lemarisc> hi guys
[07:38:22] <lemarisc> just wandering if this selector is ok $('input[type=:checkbox[name='billingemail']').attr('value', 'wassup');
[07:39:32] <zedar187> how can i start a command without a selector? it's about the slideto-plugin (http://jesseprice.com/jquery-slide-to-plugin/) - i've got an if-statement, that looks at the page-hash, and then should scroll to the certain div.
[07:39:33] <thang> you can use the web inspector in chrome, or firebug and type it at the console there to see if it returns something
[07:39:36] <angrywombat> Gozzy: thank you!
[07:40:09] <Gozzy> devc why are you using clearTimeout on those variables your not setting them to a interval to begin with..
[07:40:17] <ezio> is it okay to add arbitrary attributes to div tags?
[07:40:18] <lemarisc> or maybe something like $jq('input[type='text'][name='billingemail']').attr('value', 'wassup');
[07:40:33] <lemarisc> without the "jq" sorry
[07:40:46] <BillCriswell> ezio: You should use data- attributes.
[07:41:07] <BillCriswell> Like... data-foo="bar".
[07:41:15] <ezio> BillCriswell, you mean i can add arbitrary attributes as long as i prefix it with data
[07:41:21] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[07:41:24] <ezio> okay
[07:42:21] <devc> Gozzy: I just was lazy to rename the function. In my app cbTimers is an array of setTimeout's, set by clicks as callbacks.
[07:42:45] <Gozzy> k
[07:43:42] <rabbi1> hi, trying to achieve tabs, my codes are according to the example from the jquery site, included all required files. but still doesn't work any suggestions ?
[07:44:30] <devc> Gozzy: Updated it - http://jsfiddle.net/6uPfe/2/
[07:45:45] <Gozzy> your code works doesnt it..
[07:46:07] <Gozzy> http://jsfiddle.net/6uPfe/3/
[07:46:21] <Gozzy> put a alert inside it to make it obvious
[07:47:27] <devc> What do you mean it doesn't work? They all fire.
[07:48:23] <Gozzy> http://jsfiddle.net/6uPfe/6/ sure because you set the setTimeout/ setInterval
[07:48:30] <devc> Gozzy: If we do this http://jsfiddle.net/6uPfe/4/ so they're closer together you get the 1 second fire, the 5 second fire, and the 10 second fire
[07:49:10] <devc> Gozzy: Right. And when you click "Stop cbTimers" the other timers don't fire anymore, but the array is still populated. I'm trying to clear that array.
[07:49:22] <Gozzy> yes it works as expected.. first you get 1 that you get 2 and if you click clear you dont get any alerts anymore
[07:49:29] <Gozzy> achso
[07:49:58] <devc> But the array is still populated even after you've cleared the timers.
[07:50:23] <devc> That's what I'm trying to figure out.
[07:53:43] <Gozzy> http://jsfiddle.net/6uPfe/7/
[07:54:10] <Fox`> do $ conflicts look like this? "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'myapp'"
[07:54:18] <devc> The problem is that the array passed to the function is a copy of the actual array, right? So when I click "stop cbTimers" and it tries timerArray = []; it's not relating to cbTimers.
[07:54:58] <EdwardIII> i'm confused
[07:55:00] <EdwardIII> http://jsfiddle.net/Q8ryZ/
[07:55:15] <devc> Gozzy: Yeah the problem there is the function is supposed to be a timer clearer, so I'll be passing different arrays to it at different times. Sometimes I don't want the callbacks cleared, I want another array cleared.
[07:56:02] <devc> EdwardIII: http://jsfiddle.net/Q8ryZ/1/ - Variable scope.
[07:56:05] <EdwardIII> when i enter the function, i can print out 'beavis', and 'beavis' == butthead, fine, that makes sense. so how come, inside the func, var beavis = beavis || 'butthead' prints out 'butthead'? beavis is obviously true as it prints out 'cornholio'
[07:56:30] <devc> When you state 'var' it's creating a variable for the function only.
[07:56:44] <xec> devc: you used the same name for the var.. http://jsfiddle.net/Q8ryZ/2/
[07:56:44] <devc> You're actually wanting to read the global variable you set.
[07:56:57] <EdwardIII> devc: so var beavis = // and by here, beavis is now undefined?
[07:57:30] <xec> devc: sorry, meant EdwardIII ofcourse
[07:57:32] <ezio> if a selector returns an array, is there any better way to select an index?  ie ... is there a faster way than $($('myselector')[0]).attr...
[07:57:37] <devc> EdwardIII: I think that xec comment was directed at you, and he's smarter than me.
[07:58:05] <xec> devc: i actually liked your version better than mine ;)
[07:58:47] <EdwardIII> devc, xec: it's more an interest in the language rather than a specific problem i'm trying to solve
[07:58:52] <devc> EdwardIII: But, yes, you're correct. I'm talking to the global variable by adding window to it, but when you instantiate "var beavis" now your beavis is different than window.beavis.
[07:59:10] <xec> EdwardIII: you could also write to the global instead of redefening it, like http://jsfiddle.net/Q8ryZ/3/
[07:59:28] <EdwardIII> it actually pertains to an issue with google analytics i was having
[07:59:44] <EdwardIII> var _gaq = _gaq || [] // was inside a function, and therefore, mega-borken
[08:00:19] <EdwardIII> was easy enough to fix, but i was interested in what part of js scoping i wasn't understanding
[08:00:28] <xec> EdwardIII: ah, i see. then yes. it's undefined http://jsfiddle.net/Q8ryZ/4/
[08:01:02] <devc> xec:  Any idea on my Array issue?
[08:01:27] <xec> devc: i just got back, what was it?
[08:01:55] <EdwardIII> xec: hrm so the beavis after the = means 'local beavis' not 'global beavis'
[08:02:11] <EdwardIII> should have finished reading SICP :)
[08:02:20] <EdwardIII> or perhaps the crockford lectures
[08:02:40] <devc> http://jsfiddle.net/6uPfe/4/ - I'm trying to create a function to clear timers from an array. Throughout my app I'm creating a ton of setTimeout's, and I want to manage them. To do this I'm pushing all setTimeout's into an appropriate Array.
[08:03:00] <xec> yes, whenever you do var, it is hoisted to the top of the parent function, so it would be the same as first doing "var beavis;" and then seeing whats in it
[08:03:10] <devc> For example, I have cbTimers = new Array();, as in the example, but I also have traitTimers = new Array(); defined.
[08:03:23] <EdwardIII> xec: i didn't make that mental association, i guess because the statement hadn't ended yet
[08:03:42] <devc> I want to be able to pass array's to the function clearTimers(cbTimers); and have it stop all the timers, and empty the array.
[08:04:23] <devc> My problem is that I don't know what array is being passed, and because of that, I don't know how to access the global Array. Instead I'm working with the local array within the function?
[08:04:33] <em0vskangoura> Hello guys, i am trying to pass 2 data variables to a page, with $.ajax() function, but i cant make it work. I tried doing this: data: "update=" + encodeURI(update) + "&id=" + encodeURI(id)   ***And this: data: { update : update, id : id } . Any ideas ?
[08:04:51] <EdwardIII> devc: window.cbTimers?
[08:05:18] <devc> EdwardIII: It's fine if I know cbTimers, but what happens if I want to clear alternateTimers?
[08:05:29] <devc> and leave cbTimers alone.
[08:05:41] <EdwardIII> devc: hrm... world of metadata?
[08:06:10] <EdwardIII> i'm not sure how you say window.accessMethodWithThisName(name-in) heh
[08:06:27] <devc> The obvious would be to pass it a string instead and run a Switch on the passed string but it's much more robust to actually pass the array
[08:06:42] <EdwardIII> it isn't that this is more of a case for OO?
[08:07:54] <devc> EdwardIII: Indeed.
[08:08:36] <EdwardIII> or a wee closure...
[08:09:14] <Gozzy> devc would like to know whats the solution too when you fix this.. :)
[08:09:40] <nFFF> devc, whats the issue exactly?
[08:09:53] <nFFF> if you pass any array fromt he global scope it should be fine
[08:10:01] <xec> devc: why don't you just do cbTimers = []; instead of timerArray = [];
[08:10:37] <devc> xec: Because it's a simplified isolated function right now. In the application I have 5 or 6 arrays of tiemrs that at different times I want to be able to clear.
[08:11:33] <devc> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/6uPfe/4/ the problem is that I don't know "cbTimers" in a real use case. I pass different arrays at different times.
[08:12:08] <devc> so while I could do cbTimers = []; to clear the array in jsfiddle - sometimes I want to leave cbTimers alone, and clear, say.. traitTimers.
[08:12:19] <xec> devc: well, it does work - you do clear the timers
[08:12:36] <devc> xec: Right. Sorry, I mean I want to clear the array. Sorry.
[08:12:57] <Gozzy> xec delete timerarray[i] does remove it from the array but does not adjust the array length
[08:13:06] <nFFF> so in your loop just delete
[08:13:07] <Gozzy> * devc
[08:13:09] <Gozzy> sorry
[08:13:11] <nFFF> ^^
[08:13:31] <brettster> Does anyone know if there is a way to see if an addon is installed in chrome and if not - run a script
[08:13:44] <brettster> ive got the script running only if the browser is chrome
[08:13:55] <brettster> so that's not an issue
[08:14:23] <brettster> but i need the script to check if the addon is already installed before it says to install it.
[08:14:39] <xec> devc: well, i don't see why you need to clear the array, but i'm guessing you could simply store the timers in closures instead of as a global array
[08:15:04] <EdwardIII> hey, that was my suggestion!
[08:15:15] * EdwardIII validated?
[08:15:22] <nFFF> devc
[08:15:22] <nFFF> http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-array-remove/
[08:15:31] <Gozzy> xec isnt it kind of weird that delete does work but slice doesnt?
[08:15:51] <xec> Gozzy: i'm not quite sure what you mean
[08:16:15] <ezio> if a selector returns an array, is there any better way to select an index?  ie ... is there a faster way than $($('myselector')[0]).attr...
[08:16:23] <brettster> http://pastie.org/3542105
[08:16:32] <brettster> that's my current code
[08:16:33] <devc> xec... Hold on, I'll show you what he means
[08:16:40] <bot-t> ezio, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[08:16:55] <Gozzy> delete timerArray[i]; does remove it from the global, timerArray = timerArray.slice(0,0); does not adjust the global
[08:17:16] <devc> http://jsfiddle.net/6uPfe/10/
[08:17:30] <ezio> ty
[08:18:19] <antgel_> hi all, when i have nested tabs, both with class=".tabs", and call $('.tabs').tabs;, the inner set renders fine but is broken.  when i click on an inner tab i get Uncaught jQuery UI Tabs: Mismatching fragment identifier.
[08:18:27] <antgel_> any clues?  i'm flummoxed
[08:19:00] <Gozzy> xec http://jsfiddle.net/6uPfe/11/
[08:19:02] <devc> So while it's deleting the value, the array.length is still there - in this case I don't actually need the array cleared I suppose but there will be tens of thousands of timers by the end of a session if I don't clear it so it makes sense from a cleanliness point of view. If I ever create other functions to manipulate the array I dont want a bunch of dead timers in there to iterate over..
[08:19:24] <ajpiano> don't use delete on an array it's not for that.
[08:20:04] <ajpiano> antgel_: the tabs need to have different fragment identifiers in them, as you can see it's quite possible to do it.  http://jsbin.com/isoli3/17/edit#preview
[08:20:31] <antgel_> ajpiano: right, i'll have a look, thanks.  everything i read suggests it should just work :(
[08:20:53] <ajpiano> "just work" doesn't mean "you can do it wrong and still have it magically work"
[08:21:28] <antgel_> ajpiano: yes, i see, it's *my* identifiers.  woops and thanks so much for the help
[08:22:08] <devc> ajpiano: Do you know of a way to pass an Array to a function then work with the global array from within that function, instead of the local argument?
[08:23:09] <xec> devc: i would do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/6uPfe/12/
[08:24:39] <antgel_> ajpiano: damn.  i have two sets of tabs, different identifiers for all of them, getting the same error.  any further clue?
[08:24:51] <xec> devc: the alert(cbTimers); doesnt make much sense anymore, but you get the idea ?
[08:27:06] <devc> xec: Is this what you meant by a closure? EdwardIII, you too?
[08:27:41] <xec> devc: yes - now timers exists within the function, and you can clear it
[08:28:07] <EdwardIII> yeah
[08:28:32] <EdwardIII> a weeny little container
[08:28:32] <devc> this.timerArray = function() should work too?
[08:28:59] <ajpiano> antgel_: i don't know what you're experiencing, i can't solve any problem without a live demo
[08:29:00] <xec> devc: instead of the first line?
[08:29:02] <devc> This project is SO FAR beyond anything I've done in JS so it's been a 5 month crash course to build it. Haha
[08:29:10] <ajpiano> devc: um, like, refer to the global
[08:29:35] <devc> xec: I'm just working within a singlet so my syntax is different. I'll give it a shot.
[08:29:35] <ajpiano> devc: i think you're probably going about solving your problem in a crazy way but i can't spare half an hour right now to deal with getting it the right way, sorry :(
[08:30:05] <devc> ajpiano: No worries. You've helped me a ton over the years. I appreciate it. Looks like xec  and EdwardIII straightened me out.
[08:30:09] <ajpiano> ok
[08:31:26] <xec> devc: i don't see where or why you would want to do the this.timerArray thing though
[08:31:37] <LukeNukem> Hello the good people of jquery
[08:32:06] <ckline> hello
[08:32:36] <ckline> anyone know why this is returning null? http://jsfiddle.net/ibike365/4aceJ/
[08:33:16] <ckline> i've never used $.parseJSON() before
[08:36:04] <ajpiano> ckline: that's not JSON, it's an object literal
[08:36:12] <xec> ckline: maybe it's because you're passing a js object rather than a json string
[08:36:18] <ajpiano> ?g ben alman no such thing as json object @ ckline
[08:36:21] <bot-t> ckline, Ben Alman  There's no such thing as a "JSON Object" - http://benalman.com/news/2010/03/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-json/

[08:37:55] <ckline> thanks alex
[08:38:03] <nFFF> devc, can't you do something like this: 1
[08:38:11] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/6uPfe/13/
[08:38:32] <ckline> and xec :)
[08:38:40] <antgel_> ajpiano: i'll try to provide later, thanks
[08:43:46] <nFFF> devc?
[08:44:08] <nFFF> Gozzy, also why doens't slice work for you?
[08:44:15] <rabbi1> can't find document/ demo on graphs in jquery :( any suggestion ?
[08:44:38] <devc> nFFF: That looks like it works, I'd just already begun the Find & Replace to update it with the closure example from xec (and EdwardIII in an indrect way ;))
[08:44:45] <chris_w> rabbi1, http://www.jqplot.com/tests/
[08:45:12] <chris_w> rabbi1, like those?
[08:45:30] <nFFF> devc, ok
[08:45:35] <rabbi1> chris_w: having a look
[08:45:38] <nFFF> well this way should work for any array you put into it
[08:45:47] <nFFF> and its simple :D
[08:45:52] <ezio> how do i force a div to scoll to a specific element?
[08:46:09] <devc> nFFF: To be honest I am not clever enough to know which is a better solution. It DOES look simple, but I'm always scared of getting into editing .prototype. stuff :D
[08:46:29] <nFFF> maybe xec can comment as he knows more than me
[08:46:34] * nFFF pushes xec
[08:46:45] <rabbi1> chris_w: yes, did like it
[08:46:47] * xec falls over
[08:47:04] <rabbi1> i am actually looking for gantt chart as well
[08:47:10] <devc> That's bullying, I'm calling the principal.
[08:47:11] <nFFF> xec, why can't he just prototype Array with a removeAll method?
[08:47:22] <nFFF> see: http://jsfiddle.net/6uPfe/13/
[08:47:43] <kmiklas12345> hi
[08:47:43] <nFFF> Is there anyhting inherently wrong with my solution?
[08:48:44] <ezio> how do i force a div to scoll to a specific element?
[08:49:13] <nFFF> ezio, the apge to sctoll to a speicific element?
[08:49:14] <xec> nFFF: well... it will work. and most likely no issues with it. but you are messing with a built in object, which could do harm in the future
[08:49:17] <nFFF> or an actually div
[08:49:24] <ezio> nFFF, a div
[08:49:44] <crashev> hello how to convert var code='<div id="s">some</div>'; so I can use something like $(code).find('#s').html('replaced'); ?
[08:50:17] <xec> nFFF: it messes with for..in loops and what if Array gets a removeAll method natively in the future
[08:50:19] <ezio> <div style='overflow:auto'><div id='div_1' /><div id='div_2' />
[08:50:26] <ezio> scroll to div 2
[08:50:37] <nFFF> xec, I guess, could name the method something chinese :DD
[08:55:03] <brettster> anyone know of  a host that provides e mail admin to a client
[08:55:12] <brettster> without giving them access to the entire cpanel
[08:55:13] <kmiklas12345> Any difference between using single and double quotes in a selector?
[08:55:22] <brettster> just the ability to add/delete accounts
[08:55:22] <brettster> etc
[08:55:54] <kmiklas12345> @brettster paid or free?
[08:56:01] <brettster> paid
[08:56:07] <kmiklas12345> google mail
[08:56:23] <brettster> How would that work
[08:56:24] <brettster> ?
[08:56:27] <kmiklas12345> sec..
[08:56:42] <brettster> for example the site would be hosted at broomerepublicans.com

[08:56:53] <kmiklas12345> gmail offers this service.
[08:56:58] <dp> does anyone know of a fancybox method to reposition the object vertically?
[08:56:59] <kmiklas12345> you can set it up with your custom URL
[08:57:10] <jita> Why does this $( ".message" ).live("click", function() {} work
[08:57:15] <kmiklas12345> it's nice
[08:57:21] <jita> while $( ".message" ).on("click", function() {} doesnt
[08:57:22] <jita> any idea ?
[08:57:38] <nFFF> whcih jquery you using?
[08:57:45] <jita> nFFF, 1.7.1
[08:58:02] <brettster> so it's 5 a month per user?
[08:58:03] <nFFF> when is .message added to the DOM?
[08:58:16] <xec> jita: .live() isn't the same as .on()
[08:58:24] <jita> nFFF, When the page loads
[08:58:28] <kmiklas12345> It was $50/year per user when I set it up.
[08:58:34] <rabbi1> chris_w: it doesn't have 3D pie chart ?
[08:58:36] <kmiklas12345> Not sure if they changed that... check out their pricing.
[08:58:45] <jita> xec, the site says that live is deprecated, use on instead
[08:58:57] <chris_w> rabbi1, I have no idea, first jquery chart stuff that came up in google :)
[08:59:04] <xec> jita: yes, but the syntax is different
[08:59:13] <jita> xec, what should i use ?
[08:59:23] <xec> jita: you need to listen to events on elements not yet in the DOM you need to bind .on() to something that does
[08:59:33] <rabbi1> chris_w: ok :) thanks, though you are the developer....
[08:59:41] <chris_w> rabbi1, nope
[08:59:47] <nFFF> jita, http://jsfiddle.net/Uj3cw/
[09:00:07] <xec> jita: .live() binds to document afaik, so if you want the equivalent you can do $(document).on("click", ".message", function(){ ... });
[09:01:31] <kmiklas12345> on calls delegate()
[09:01:34] <xec> jita: or just do your selecting after DOM ready
[09:01:47] <jita> xec, doesn't work either. Actually the .message gets updated using ajax
[09:01:51] <kmiklas12345> and delegate() is currently preferred
[09:02:05] <nFFF> jita, you said it was added on apge load?
[09:02:06] <kmiklas12345> so use on() and off() if you have 1.7, .delegate() for previous versions
[09:02:22] <jita> nFFF, yes but then some event on that page, triggers the updating of that division
[09:02:51] <iateadonut> i've got a checkbox in one <td> and in the previous <td> a radio button.  I was trying to select the radio button based on the checkbox, but realized because of the <td>, this won't work:   $('#websitesTableDiv input:checkbox[name=websites]:checked').prevAll('input:radio[name=chooseWebsite]').attr('checked',true);
[09:02:52] <xec> jita: it should work. do you have any other click handlers that prevent bubbling perhaps?
[09:03:06] <WebDragon> jquery-ui 1.8.18 defines both clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px); clip: rect(1px,1px,1px,1px); in .ui-helper-hidden-accessible but doesn't explain why it's there in comments
[09:03:11] <xec> jita: any errors in console?
[09:03:16] <jita> xec, nope
[09:03:18] <iateadonut> prevAll won't work because it is not a sibling - how do i reach into the previous <td> and work that statement?
[09:03:37] <WebDragon> naturally it's one of the many things that the validator barfs on
[09:03:39] <xec> ?closest @ iateadonut
[09:03:39] <bot-t> iateadonut, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[09:04:46] <xec> iateadonut: closest to find the tr and then you can do prev() or prevAll() or what you needed
[09:05:18] <jita> xec, sorry $(document).on("click", ".message", function(){ ... }); does indeed works
[09:05:22] <jita> xec, thanks a lot
[09:05:35] <xec> yw :)
[09:06:34] <rabbi1> my menu has submenu, after adding jquery tab ui, my submenu going behind the tab ... what should i do ?
[09:06:50] <iateadonut> xec, got it.
[09:07:50] <jita> xec, one more thing, should i attach to the immediate parent of the division whose content is being replaced instead of document? Should it improve the performance
[09:08:18] <xec> jita: the closest parent that is permanent is usually best
[09:08:33] <jita> xec, ok thanks
[09:08:38] <xec> but i doubt you will ever notice a difference
[09:09:34] <nFFF> Whats the difference in process speed between desktop and mobile browsers
[09:09:41] <nFFF> when do these things come a concern for mobile users
[09:09:46] <nFFF> or is it still neglibibl;e
[09:16:58] <rasmusth> does anybody have an idea of why the following code is blocked in safari: http://www.pastie.org/3542491

[09:18:46] <iateadonut> if this is turning the td that contains that radio button red, why isn't it checking the radio button?
[09:18:52] <shwaiil> xec: tks for looking :)
[09:18:54] <xec> shwaiil: like, you will search for "selector" within "B"
[09:19:00] <Snerf> I am looking for a way to get the selected text, in html format, from an iframe

[09:19:29] <iateadonut> d'oh
[09:20:43] <xec> iateadonut: you figured it out?
[09:21:16] <iateadonut> yup.  just conffirmed.  thanks for all your help.
[09:21:49] <jomofcw> I get an error under IE about this element : e.Callbacks("once memory"); this is part of the jQuery core.
[09:24:08] <tbranyen> if i have a $.get that fails if i request immediately but works after a stack clear (setTimeout) , is there anyway i can just delay the request?
[09:24:56] <ajpiano> tbranyen: wat
[09:25:22] <tbranyen> ajpiano: no idea
[09:25:30] <tbranyen> $.get in a dom ready pukes
[09:25:37] <iateadonut> isn't delay() a javascript function?
[09:25:41] <iateadonut> or maybe that's php
[09:25:46] <tbranyen> wrap in a setTimeout(function() { $.get(..) }, 0);
[09:25:50] <tbranyen> thing succeeds fine
[09:25:51] <ajpiano> tbranyen: i think you know full well that that's clearly some kind of app specific thing
[09:26:01] <iateadonut> sleep() is the phpp one.
[09:26:02] <tbranyen> ajpiano: how is that even possibly my app?
[09:26:04] <ajpiano> and that the general idea that $.get always fails in DOM ready wouldn't be true
[09:26:22] <tbranyen> ajpiano: dom ready is probably irrelevant
[09:26:27] <tbranyen> just giving it context
[09:26:33] <ajpiano> tbranyen: i don't know. but if $.get just "didn't work" inside of a doc ready block you wouldn't just be finding out about it on march 7th 2012
[09:26:34] <tbranyen> i mean its a server fail
[09:26:45] <tbranyen> ajpiano: i don't think for a second this is a jquery issue
[09:26:51] <ajpiano> ok, me neither :)
[09:26:57] <tbranyen> i'm just curious if there is way to keep jqXhr from sending
[09:27:03] <tbranyen> until the stack has cleared
[09:27:13] <tbranyen> or is it as soon as i create the $.get or $.ajax it immediately sends
[09:27:26] <tbranyen> and return the jqxhr
[09:27:30] <tbranyen> i mean it is a promise
[09:27:32] <ajpiano> tbranyen: duck punch $.get to be setTimeout(function() { $.get(...) }
[09:27:33] <ajpiano> :p
[09:27:41] <tbranyen> won't work, i need the jqxhr
[09:27:42] <tbranyen> its for sync
[09:27:54] <snover> wattttttt
[09:27:55] <tbranyen> i guess i'd have to duck punch at a lower level
[09:28:12] <ajpiano> poor duck
[09:28:14] <tbranyen> ajpiano: might be able to get it working with ajaxTransport, but jeesh i hope not
[09:28:22] <tbranyen> i'd like to know why its failing too
[09:28:26] <tbranyen> might just be a chrome dev tools bug
[09:29:29] <BillCriswell> tbranyen: I use incognito mode for sanity checks quite often.
[09:29:41] <tbranyen> BillCriswell: i don't think its a caching issue
[09:29:53] <tbranyen> also i have cache disabled
[09:30:01] <tbranyen> hrm its not a dev tools bug
[09:30:04] <tbranyen> success is def not being called
[09:30:07] <tbranyen> unless i clear the stack
[09:30:15] <tbranyen> weak
[09:30:23] <BillCriswell> Do you have the data type set right?
[09:30:34] <tbranyen> BillCriswell: why would that matter
[09:30:40] <tbranyen> it works if i clear the stack with the exact same call
[09:30:48] <BillCriswell> Oh, dunno then.
[09:31:17] <arnpro> hey guys, what are best practices when working with a website that will be fully jquery based, lots of ajax, no page refreshing. whats better between having the ajax calls return the layout'd content, or just return json and format it from the UI???
[09:32:54] <NoReGreT> can anyone help with ajaxForm() here
[09:33:01] <tbranyen> ajpiano: i'm so confused dude
[09:33:03] <tbranyen> you have no idea
[09:33:38] <Emn1ty> tbranyen: what's up?
[09:33:56] <tbranyen> oh shit i think i figured it out
[09:33:57] <tbranyen> holy christ
[09:34:00] <tbranyen> maybe
[09:34:09] <Emn1ty> possibly?
[09:34:35] <tbranyen> yeah figured it out
[09:34:35] <tbranyen> urgh
[09:34:41] <tbranyen> don't write methods like ajaxAbortAll
[09:34:46] <tbranyen> and run them after making a request
[09:34:54] <tbranyen> christ
[09:35:47] <Emn1ty> lol
[09:35:53] <arnpro> tbranyen: sorry I just got in, but what are you trying to accomplish?
[09:36:01] <tbranyen> arnpro: sanity
[09:36:01] <Emn1ty>  would anyone be willing to sit down and help me modify the flot pluging to allow draggable points? At the moment there is a patch for it but I'm having troubly applying it. Flot: http://code.google.com/p/flot/, patch: http://code.google.com/p/flot/issues/detail?id=282
[09:36:31] <Emn1ty> tbranyen: always a good thing to aim for
[09:36:46] <eddiemonge> anyone know how i can the percentage of users on each of the different firefox versions?
[09:37:23] <arnpro> very nice plugin Emn1ty
[09:37:52] <Emn1ty> arnpro: agreed, but I need to allow a user to drag a specific plot on this chart (fyi, its not my plugin)
[09:39:45] <Emn1ty> eddiemonge: google anyalytics?
[09:40:29] <eddiemonge> im looking for more specific analytics from them
[09:41:25] <Emn1ty> well, you can always check the browser version and and save the info to a database.
[09:43:23] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: how would i do that for every user of firefox?
[09:45:10] <Emn1ty> eddiemonge: well do you have a way to track if a user has visited the site before or not? such as sign ups or whatever?
[09:46:23] <eddiemonge> Emn1ty: im not talking about any specific site. im talking about firefox users and how long there releases  are sticking around/how quickly they are updating now
[09:47:33] <epm> Hello. I have a "can I do this in jquery" question.
[09:47:42] <epm> Can I create a fixed, floating item that stays resident between page calls - not just resident in terms of location, but actually fixed - unchanging and unrefreshed while the pages below continue to change with the users navigation.
[09:48:48] <BabeLing> hi
[09:49:04] <eddiemonge> epm: you mean like frames?
[09:49:12] <Emn1ty> eddiemonge: i don't know how to do that
[09:49:51] <epm> I suppose
[09:50:14] <epm> it would probably be more likely i frames
[09:50:30] <epm> but maybe there is another way.
[09:50:42] <Emn1ty> you can use ajax to refresh page content
[09:50:53] <Emn1ty> rather than reload the page
[09:51:37] <epm> so could I have page that contained two iframes, one that lived at the top level and one below and have the entire website be presented in the bottom frame?
[09:51:54] <Emn1ty> well, you only need a single iframe
[09:52:09] <epm> I see what you're saying, but that would not be realistic for my use case.
[09:52:31] <Emn1ty> epm: alright
[09:53:10] <epm> I'm thinking of maybe the way chat sessions work, but they tend to appear in seperate floating windows.
[09:54:14] <epm> I would want that kind of continuous connection in a presentation that was fixed in the browser,  not appearing as a second window.
[09:55:24] <Emn1ty> epm: i'd look into ajax then cause I don't know what else will give you that functionality.
[09:55:33] <eddiemonge> epm: you could save the state on page unload to your server and then restore that state when the new page is loaded
[09:55:59] <epm> Emn1ty: i think you are probably right.
[09:57:18] <epm> eddiemonge: it's not just the state the needs to be saved, its an open connection to another system, again, like a chat session. If the device is embedded in the page, the connection will close when a new page is loaded.
[09:58:16] <dogan21> hello, if there is a div called parent and inside it a div called child and have this: $("#parent, #child).click.....   how when i click child execute only child and prevent running event twice?
[09:58:32] <eddiemonge> ?preventdefault @ dogan21
[09:58:32] <bot-t> dogan21, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[09:58:49] <epm> so I am looking for a way to make an item appear to be embedded in a page (not free floating like a windows) but to stay resident and connected as the pages change.
[09:59:36] <mutedia> change everything around it?
[10:05:54] <Emn1ty>  would anyone be willing to sit down and help me modify the flot pluging to allow draggable points? At the moment there is a patch for it but I'm having troubly applying it. Flot: http://code.google.com/p/flot/, patch: http://code.google.com/p/flot/issues/detail?id=282
[10:18:27] <ezio> how do you deal with modified closures in .each
[10:20:03] <blendedbychris> can someone recommend a slider that supports 100% width or a way to get anythingslider to work with 100% width. http://chevrolet.com does it but I have no idea how.
[10:20:24] <aqeel> hi room
[10:21:18] <aqeel> can i implement a progress bar which shows the loading of load contents into the div.......then loads page
[10:22:42] <aqeel> what is the best approach for this
[10:25:05] <raa> hi
[10:25:12] <aqeel> hi
[10:25:32] <raa> i am from banladesh
[10:25:38] <raa> bangladesh
[10:26:25] <raa> anyone help me
[10:26:43] <bot-t> raa, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:31:21] <MagmaRules> Hi there, anyone knows of a splitter like http://methvin.com/splitter/ but that works with query 1.7.1?
[10:31:56] <MagmaRules> UI layout for me is unusable, slow and sluggish, and http://krikus.com/js/splitter/ refuses to colapse to the right
[10:32:29] <Emn1ty> Hate to ask again but would anyone be willing to sit down and help me modify the flot plugin to allow draggable points? At the moment there is a patch for it but I'm having trouble applying it. Flot: http://code.google.com/p/flot/, patch: http://code.google.com/p/flot/issues/detail?id=282 - I really need the help so anyone who can spare the time helping me or possibly properly applying the
[10:32:29] <Emn1ty> patch would be great!
[10:35:51] <nFFF> Emn1ty
[10:35:58] <nFFF> why don't you pay someone to do this for you?
[10:36:03] <monk12> hello all, just curious is there a way to take something like this: $('#latest_div .radio, #latest_div .checkbox') into something like:  $('#latest_div (.radio||.checkbox)')
[10:37:20] <nFFF> monk12, I don't think that's a valid selector
[10:37:36] <nFFF> nor why it's useful
[10:37:42] <Emn1ty> nFFF: cause I'm the one being payed to do it and honestly all I want is help or someone who can get this darn file to patch properly (i know 0 about patching files)
[10:37:51] <Emn1ty> or how to troubleshoot them
[10:37:59] <nFFF> me neither ;|
[10:38:22] <monk12> nFFF, just was curious :)
[10:38:27] <nFFF> monk12, you may be better with $('#latest_div').find('.radio, .checkbox');
[10:38:30] <monk12> Emn1ty, what u need to patch?
[10:38:45] <nFFF> but it doesn't really matter
[10:38:46] <Emn1ty> http://code.google.com/p/flot/issues/detail?id=282
[10:38:47] <monk12> nFFF, ahh thats interesting.
[10:39:00] <aqeel> so if i have contents loading from external files how can i like make a progress bar of how much contents has loaded
[10:39:33] <aqeel> go jquery way or use plugins?
[10:40:05] <rroelofs> Emn1ty: the patch is a 1 line addition to jquery.flot.js and a whoe new file with the draggable code in it
[10:41:38] <Emn1ty> roelofs: yes, but I've tried 1) deleting the patch information and adding the code only to get undefined for findNearbyItem and then I've tried using Netbeans to patch and gotten patch errors. I'm seriously alien to this kind of thing so...
[10:42:48] <aqeel> Display a Progress bar while loading content in a DIV using jQuery
[10:43:12] <Emn1ty> aqeel: do you want actual progress or just an animation?
[10:43:51] <aqeel> actual....i have tons of contents loaed via load into div
[10:44:12] <aqeel> jquery loads before the page loads....
[10:44:32] <aqeel> and thus buttons have no effects as contents have not yet fully loaded
[10:44:41] <rroelofs> Emn1ty: if you do it by hand you only care about the lines that start with + (and you remove the +
[10:45:22] <rroelofs> I have only ever used the command line version of patch so I can't say what went wrong earlier
[10:45:35] <Emn1ty> command line scares me, lol
[10:46:08] <Emn1ty> anyways, I'll try that again and see what happens.
[10:46:16] <rroelofs> Also, the patch is against a particular version from several years ago
[10:46:26] <rroelofs> so it may not work
[10:46:28] <Emn1ty> i know, which is another issue.
[10:46:35] <rroelofs> it is probably the main issue
[10:46:54] <Emn1ty> possibly
[10:47:17] <monk12> Emn1ty, whats the file you want to patch?
[10:47:18] <rroelofs> automated patch will only work against that specific version
[10:47:24] <Emn1ty> the weird thing is that there is mention of it working with the newer versions so I'm not sure
[10:47:25] <monk12> i see the patch.
[10:47:31] <monk12> just curious what you want to patch
[10:47:41] <Emn1ty> i'd assume its the main flot.js file
[10:48:22] <monk12> gotcha i see.
[10:48:26] <Emn1ty> http://people.iola.dk/olau/flot/jquery.flot.js - that
[10:48:28] <monk12> jquery.flot.js and the draggable one
[10:48:33] <monk12> it does two
[10:49:00] <Emn1ty> hm...
[10:49:24] <c0d3rg1rl> Hello, somebody here who can correct a documentation bug in docs.jquery.com ?
[10:49:53] <ajpiano> c0d3rg1rl: file a ticket on bugs.jquery.com
[10:50:01] <Emn1ty> there is no draggable file that I know of.
[10:50:19] <rroelofs> Emn1ty:   the patch creates it
[10:50:23] <Emn1ty> ah
[10:50:25] <c0d3rg1rl> On http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Slider it says at event change: ".. Use event.orginalEvent to detect  .." but it should say: ".. Use event.originalEvent to detect ..", not the missing 'i'
[10:50:27] <monk12> Emn1ty, do you have a patch utility?
[10:50:39] <shennyg> I've got a plugin and want to access the current number it is on in the .each. How do I do that? here is the code: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1674932/preload-images-from-an-ajax-call/1675544#1675544
[10:50:49] <Emn1ty> monk12: i have netbeans, but again I'm alien to its function
[10:51:06] <ajpiano> c0d3rg1rl: i can just fix this now, thans
[10:51:14] <c0d3rg1rl> took me an hour now...
[10:51:30] <ajpiano> that's cause acct creation on docs.jquery.com is disabled....
[10:52:12] <ajpiano> c0d3rg1rl: fixed
[10:52:12] <ajpiano> thanks.
[10:52:39] <danheberden> lol ajpiano i fixed it at the same time as you
[10:52:44] <ajpiano> lol
[10:52:46] <c0d3rg1rl> thanks, copy/pasted the wronf 'orginalEvent' from there, and got to nowhere ;-)
[10:52:50] <danheberden> we always seem to do that
[10:54:29] <c0d3rg1rl> others had the same problem earlier, there is even a fix, but they did not notify the docs... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2773422/how-to-determine-whether-jquery-ui-slider-thumb-is-chainged-programmatically-or
[10:55:24] <c0d3rg1rl> thanks for quick docs-update guys.
[10:55:39] <monk12> Emn1ty, im not gonna get ya to download cygwin or try this one Linux to just get a command patch utility ...   so here is a direct link to one:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/patch/2.5.9-7/patch-2.5.9-7-bin.zip/download
[10:57:14] <monk12> Emn1ty,  1. download flot.zip 2. unzip it. 3. put patch.exe in the same driectory for now.
[10:57:38] <monk12> 4. also copy that patch file in the same directory flot.patch
[10:57:39] <ajpiano> Emn1ty: the patch only works on flot 0.6
[10:57:40] <monk12> 5. patch --dry-run --verbose < flot.patch
[10:57:41] <monk12> done
[10:57:48] <provost> Getting calls from customers that a select menu update hangs, and I'm getting desperate after weeks of trying to fix this
[10:57:59] <monk12> well without dry-run param if actually want to apply it.
[10:58:08] <ajpiano> Emn1ty: http://jsfiddle.net/mamtg/ you can also copy the javascript of that fiddle
[10:58:23] <ajpiano> Emn1ty: it has the contents of jquery.flot.js and jquery.flot.draggable.js
[10:58:35] <Emn1ty> oh sweet ajpiano
[10:58:36] <provost> Thing is, the $.ajax method I'm running on a change event works in every test environment I throw at it, but we're still getting support calls
[10:58:55] <monk12> ajpiano, the patch works for me in 0.7. You mean its only meant for 0.6?
[10:58:56] <ajpiano> Emn1ty: that's your one freebie, it was killing me to see you wriggle around like this for days
[10:59:01] <monk12> lol.
[10:59:02] <Emn1ty> thanks for the help, can't believe it took me two days of asking to get any real help.
[10:59:09] <ajpiano> monk12: it didn't seem to work for me on 0.7
[10:59:17] <Emn1ty> yeah, i tried three patcher clients and tons of tutorials.
[10:59:36] <ajpiano> Emn1ty: it's because you were asking for something with help essentially unrelated
[10:59:42] <monk12> gotcha. i get "Patching file jquery.flot.js using Plan A" and other one also got "done".
[10:59:54] <ajpiano> Emn1ty: do you not konw anyone in your real life who can help you with a bit of unix
[11:00:07] <Emn1ty> i do, but I couldn't get a hold of him.
[11:00:23] <Emn1ty> and that's only one person, which is relatively limited.
[11:00:49] <Emn1ty> none of my friends are real programmers and the ones that are were merely aquaintences.
[11:01:41] <ajpiano> sucks man that's a rough position
[11:01:51] <ajpiano> you should try to dig in and learn the command line
[11:02:07] <ajpiano> i was a complete noob like 2 years ago, you just gotta kinda dig in and deal with it
[11:02:10] <Emn1ty> i know I should, but I have a tendency to see something alien and mind fart
[11:03:00] <ajpiano> yea monk12 it's def not working for me on flot 0.7 http://jsfiddle.net/mamtg/1/
[11:03:24] <Emn1ty> yep, that was the error I was getting
[11:03:34] <ajpiano> Emn1ty: by all means you should probably follow through with monk12's thing on how to apply a patch file on windows
[11:03:44] <Emn1ty> i was planning on it.
[11:03:48] <ajpiano> cool
[11:04:06] <ajpiano> Emn1ty: the patch is from december of 2009
[11:04:11] <ajpiano> and flot 0.7 came out in late 2011
[11:04:14] <ezio> how do i get a div to receive keypress events?
[11:04:20] <ajpiano> so i was very skeptical that it would work right
[11:04:21] <monk12> I like having cygwin around to play with linux commands in windows. I do use it quite often to do 'real work' in my Windows dev work computer. cygwin basically has windows versions of linux commands u can install. i just put its bin in my PATH so i can use it often on command line.
[11:04:56] <monk12> ajpiano, based on link you gave me... does that mean the patch applied successfully and the actual thing doesn't work?
[11:05:04] <ajpiano> monk12: yeah
[11:05:07] <monk12> ahhhh gotcha.
[11:05:08] <ajpiano> that's what i meant by didn't wor
[11:05:10] <ajpiano> :)
[11:05:24] <monk12> My bad. i didn't actually test it hehe.
[11:05:30] <ajpiano> i felt sorry for poor Emn1ty and was gonna apply the patch for him and then i realised that just applying the patch wasn't the problem
[11:05:35] <monk12> just meant it  patched successfully.
[11:05:36] <ajpiano> it didn't work on the most current version :(
[11:05:44] <ajpiano> so then i felt even worse
[11:05:58] <ajpiano> bottom line is, i still have a gigantic of pile of wires to clean up in my hallway
[11:06:13] <ajpiano> but his i think he has a version that works for his project i hope
[11:06:21] <monk12> cool.
[11:08:11] <monk12> i like cygwin with X so i can run Kcachegrind usually on my windows computer to analyze php xdebug dumps (see what functions are taking up most processing). there is a WinCacheGrind, but it sucks at getting detailed data in the dump. (and I'd rather not copy the file to run on my linux virtual machine hehe)
[11:08:46] <monk12> plus its fun to run 'xeyes' on windows hehe.
[11:09:43] <Emn1ty> monk, for these instructions do I run this in command prompt or what? The patcher you sent me has an executable in it but upon entering the command it does nothing :\
[11:10:08] <Emn1ty> <-- shoots himself for noobishness
[11:10:46] <monk12> Emn1ty, i'll pm u
[11:10:47] <ezio> has anyone here successfully got a div to recieve arrow up and down events?
[11:11:10] <Emn1ty> monk12: ok
[11:14:58] <Italian_Plumber1> Hello.  I have a piec of code here that's behaving wierdly.
[11:15:04] <Italian_Plumber1> http://pastebin.com/FKNNfFaY
[11:15:29] <Italian_Plumber1> "//do stuff" is never executed, even when I know that the output from the ajax page is "1".
[11:16:07] <Italian_Plumber1> interestingly, when I put "alert(createPartResponse.responseText);" before the if statement, "//do stuff" is executed.
[11:16:29] <Italian_Plumber1> Any ideas?
[11:16:47] <Italian_Plumber1> the alert displays nothing, by the way.
[11:18:51] <ajpiano> Italian_Plumber1: ajax is asynchronous
[11:18:56] <ajpiano> sorry to have to be the one to tell you this
[11:19:16] <ajpiano> Italian_Plumber1: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide40
[11:19:33] <ajpiano> you have to use callbacks when working with ajax
[11:21:11] <Italian_Plumber1> okay I understand that.  I tried that and couldn't get it to work.  My goal is to take the output of the createpart.php page and do stuff with it (it returns "1" or "0" depending on various factors) ... I don't want to display the output.
[11:21:28] <Italian_Plumber1> I'll return to that and attempt to troubleshoot the problems I was having.
[11:21:34] <ajpiano> you still have to do that in a callback that is somehow triggered after the request is complete
[11:24:05] <Italian_Plumber1> something like this?
[11:24:05] <Italian_Plumber1> http://pastebin.com/AxdPpMsi
[11:26:23] <ajpiano> Italian_Plumber1: no
[11:26:25] <ajpiano> that's the same problem
[11:26:31] <ajpiano> see the slide about two wrongs not making a right

[11:37:36] <IanWizard-Cloud> Didn't there used to be a way to submit a form, with ajax, and then load the response in the forms place?  (Without writing the entire ajax request by hand.)
[11:44:15] <ag4ve> it seems that .live() messes up with i .replaceWith() the same element....?
[11:44:27] <ag4ve> is this a known 'issue'?
[11:44:58] <ag4ve> or is this a non-issue and i'm doing something else wrong?
[11:55:05] <cbobo> Is there anyway to adjust the font-size depending on the width of the parent div, so that there is no white space?
[11:57:02] <DanGer> do you guys run on 1.4 already? :)
[11:57:08] <Bartzy> Hi,
[11:57:17] <Bartzy> Should I use encodeURIComponent in data: in $.ajax ?
[11:59:20] <ag4ve> cbobo: yes, but unless you want a headache i'd recommend looking for a plugin to do it.
[11:59:23] <arnpro> can someone tell me how can I apply jquery functions to a raw object from an ajax request? like the request data brought  a "<div>div here</div>" obj and I'd like to apply a highlight effect to it...
[11:59:48] <antgel> hi people.  i have a ui.draggable object in my drag and drop test.  it was an <li> from an accordion. how do i get to the actual value of the object?  i've tried looking at docs but obviously i can't see the forest for the trees
[12:00:03] <jeffsmykil> Does anyone have a recommendation for a mature custom select plugin?
[12:00:12] <antgel> i tried iterating through the object looking at all of the keys, but there are soooooo many :(
[12:02:16] <microhxo> Guys, for some reason Chrome is having trouble with $(this).is(':checked')  it always returns true, while in firefox it works properly... Here is my code: http://paste2.org/p/1930809
[12:03:21] <Woet> microhxo: not related to your issue, but why so much code?
[12:03:28] <Woet> microhxo: var boolchecked = $(this).is(':checked');
[12:03:44] <Woet> or just replace boolchecked with $(this).is(':checked') and you won't need the var at all
[12:03:57] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: suggestion for custom select?
[12:04:06] <Woet> ?demo @ microhxo
[12:04:07] <bot-t> microhxo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:04:28] <microhxo> Woet, i cant demo it. Its with a telerik grid, a bunch of json and who knows what else
[12:04:36] <antgel> hi people.  i have a ui.draggable object in my drag and drop test.  it was an <li> from an accordion. how do i get to the actual value of the object?  i've tried looking at docs but obviously i can't see the forest for the trees.  i tried ui.draggable.html but that's a function
[12:04:38] <microhxo> in firefox it works fine, in chrome i get true for everything
[12:04:56] <Woet> microhxo: the grid and json aren't relevant to your issue, so you don't have to demo that.
[12:05:03] <iLogic> is it just me or have anyone else noticed that (box and text) shadows tend to make jquery animations considerably more sluggish?
[12:05:38] <danheberden> iLogic - programmatically moving things vs using css transitions will always be more sluggish
[12:06:32] <iLogic> danheberden: yeah, however I usually perceive otherwise on most examples
[12:07:38] <antgel> oh, i understand, i drag something from the accordion and jquery gives me the whole accordion!

[12:11:29] <jeffsmykil> still hilarious
[12:12:23] <antgel> no, i'm confused again.  can i ask a very simple question.  when dragging and dropping, you get ui.draggable object.  how can you simply see what the html for said object was?
[12:13:35] <iLogic> antgel: set that as a var and var.html() ?

[12:15:55] <scalebyte> danheberden: yes
[12:16:00] <PressedWeb> Anyone use Modernizr? Does it just run "tests" to see what your browser is capable of, and then it's up to you to download/include your own polyfills (via yepnope), or does it test and automatically include the polyfills you need and can specify in your download package here: http://www.modernizr.com/download/ ?

[12:16:43] <danheberden> scalebyte that's fine, but you are writing bad JS
[12:16:53] <danheberden> and if you were to open your dev console, you'd see where it's stuck
[12:16:54] <peol> PressedWeb: It only feature detects and gives you the possibility to include your own pollyfills
[12:17:23] <PressedWeb> peol: Ok, that's what I thought. So when you're creating your download package, it's only asking you what "tests" you want to include?
[12:17:33] <peol> PressedWeb: yeah
[12:17:37] <PressedWeb> Gotcha. Thanks
[12:17:38] <danheberden> scalebyte i'd download chrome, open up dev tools (cmnd-shift-i on mac, cntrl-shift-i on pc), click the console button and run that jsfiddle

[12:19:03] <danheberden> p3rsist json data will ultimately be smaller
[12:19:10] <danheberden> and also give you meaningful data to work with

[12:20:56] <danheberden> scalebyte what link?
[12:21:02] <danheberden> get chrome, use dev tools, see your error
[12:21:03] <danheberden> fix it
[12:21:14] <scalebyte> danheberden: so u wont help me ?
[12:21:35] <danheberden> and if you really don't see the error with append("<input value="something" class="something") then you need to learn javascript
[12:21:42] <danheberden> scalebyte i AM helping you help yourself
[12:21:45] <danheberden> i'm not going to do your work for you
[12:21:52] <danheberden> if you won't even try to help yourself
[12:22:02] <danheberden> that's a WHOLE separate issue :(
[12:22:07] <scalebyte> danheberden: atleast once I am very new to jquery please mate :(
[12:22:23] <danheberden> scalebyte exactly - hence why i'm not saying "fix your parse error"
[12:22:30] <danheberden> i'm saying get some tools to see what the problem is

[12:23:29] <danheberden> as for your problem, scalebyte, you're giving append a string
[12:23:35] <danheberden> append( 'html to enter' )
[12:23:36] <danheberden> ya?
[12:24:05] <danheberden> but look at your string? you're, like, giving it a string, then words, then a string, then more words
[12:24:32] <danheberden> so  .append("<input class="something">") would definitely fail, see?
[12:24:58] <danheberden> where as .append( '<input class="something">') would definitely succeed, as the ' and the final ' contain the entire string
[12:25:21] <danheberden> if this is a topic that is foreign to you, you NEED to put in the time to learn how strings work in JS, hence the second link i referenced above
[12:25:25] <scalebyte> i got it working :)

[12:25:59] <scalebyte> danheberden: yes thanks
[12:26:31] <Eruadan> scalebyte, mate, if you reallyu want to learn jquery, best to do a javascript intro first: www.codecademy.com , i assure you that when you finish that, you gonna find jquery a breeze

[12:32:45] <GLaDOSv21> well that was unfortunate, internet failed, did anybody respond to my question of :29?
[12:33:32] <GLaDOSv2> hi, I have a kindof 'dictionary' that makes tooltips out of words in the dictionary; i have a problem with words that contain another word. eg 'index' is a word, but 'aex index' also is a word, and in that case, I don't want 'index' to match (as it will mess up the definition tooltip). I may have a workarround but it requires to 'unwrap' text (span gets added to a word in the definition list; with a selector I can unwrap recursive spans), however, 
[12:34:47] <ag4ve> is there an option to show the html in a string?

[12:35:03] <ag4ve> errr, in a jq object
[12:35:20] <Eviltwin> jQuery objects don't contain HTML
[12:35:24] <Eviltwin> They contain Elements
[12:36:00] <codezombie> has anyone had issues with jquery ui droppable not working with adblock plus for chrome enabled?
[12:36:15] <ag4ve> well, i get a string back (via .ajax) that is html. i alter it. but, i'm not altering it correctly it seems. i'd like to see what it contains before i do that.append( jqdata );
[12:37:18] <tomasm-> hi, is it possible to select an element based on text it contains inside of it? particularly a link.
[12:37:22] <ag4ve> elements.... ok, so can i print the elements in a jq object?
[12:37:31] <GLaDOSv2> this is so extremely annoying, my internet keeps kicking me off, did anybody respond to my question, if so, could you repeat it please?
[12:37:31] <Eviltwin> You can do var elems = $(jqdata); <inspect>; that.append(elems)

[12:40:00] <Eviltwin> GLaDOSv2: I didn't understand the question
[12:40:33] <JAAulde> does Malsup provide a change log for his form plugin?
[12:41:17] <GLaDOSv2> Eviltwin: I was afraid that would happen. Basically, the dev tools in Chrome now show a span contents as: "first part" \n "second part", where I need it to be "first part second part" for the script to properly function - how can I achieve that?
[12:41:24] <ag4ve> here's what i'm trying to do: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/185624
[12:41:35] <tomasm-> Eviltwin, very evil of you. thanks
[12:41:41] <ag4ve> however, it doesn't append anything
[12:43:07] <Eviltwin> ag4ve: Read what .parents does
[12:44:06] <ag4ve> oops, it seems i skimmed a bit too much on that method :)
[12:44:42] <ag4ve> Eviltwin: thanks (and i like the custom selector link too - that looks powerful
[12:44:43] <ag4ve> )
[12:44:46] <JAAulde> Anyone know of any changes to Malsup's form plugin regarding file uploads? Is it now supporting ways of uploading the file other than the hidden iframe approach?
[12:45:15] <JAAulde> After upgrading jQ and the form plugin, I am seeing errors on ajaxy-file-upload-interactions which were working fine before
[12:45:47] <JAAulde> I get a parse error on the returned data, and it looks like jQ is being given the entire markup/textarea wrapped block of JSON to parse instead of just the JSON

[12:49:29] <chx> i did a $.get(location); and it spectacularly blown up :)
[12:49:39] <GLaDOSv2> nevermind, fixed it. another question: how to use non-anymous functions, eg, how to specify a function as callback?
[12:51:39] <RandalSchwartz> hmm.  .click() doesn't seem to be doing it
[12:54:27] <NoReGreT> RandalSchwartz: try $(thatform).submit()
[12:54:53] <RandalSchwartz> NoReGreT - I figured it out... had id='#foo' :(
[12:55:06] <RandalSchwartz> but $(thatform).submit() would not have been the right answer anyway
[12:55:16] <RandalSchwartz> since it would not have included the submit-button as true
[12:55:27] <RandalSchwartz> and I'm using multiple submit buttons, which is why I needed a *particular* submit
[12:55:29] <wolfkit> Hello.  I'm trying to make a form that has a set of text boxes.  When someone types in the last text box, it should add another one.  I'm trying to accomplish this with jQuery, but the problem is that if I use .last(), it's the last element when the DOM is loaded.  So I only ever have two boxes.
[12:56:03] <heeeelpneeded> Hi people. I'm needing help with my jquery-script. Should I just tell my problem in main chat?
[12:56:11] <wolfkit> So, my question is: How do I insert a new text box under the others with jQuery, only when the last text box is changed?

[12:59:59] <fkefer> is there a better channel for asking a fancybox/fancyapps question?
[13:00:06] <JAAulde> has anyone else here upgraded jQuery to 1.7.1 and the form plugin to 2.96 and gotten parse errors on ajaxy submits of forms with file fields?
[13:03:09] <timwis> Hey guys, is it possible to hook when vanilla javascript "document.forms.form_name.submit();" is called?
[13:05:27] <heeeelpneeded> I described my problem already in the forum: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/settimeout-problem I got a tip there. But now I got my problem that just everything disappears, so I don't see the origal search button anymore. Here the current code: http://jsfiddle.net/jLfGn/1/
[13:06:01] <heeeelpneeded> So the search field disappears after 3 seconds like I want it, but I don't see the original search button anymore.
[13:08:43] <scalebyte> why isnt the remove not working for me ? http://jsfiddle.net/4dkUF/5/
[13:11:51] <ag4ve> how do i remove the outer elements from the dom: ie <div id=outer><div id=inner>text</div></div> and i want <div id=inner>text</div>

[13:14:10] <Techy7> $('#game').bind('click', function(e) {, whats wrong with this?
[13:14:15] <NoReGreT> Techy7: is classname a valid class assigned to an elemnt ?
[13:14:28] <macmartine> How can I check if an object supports a given property? This http://www.cssnewbie.com/cross-browser-support-for-html5-placeholder-text-in-forms/ says oit can be done this way https://gist.github.com/1996281 but it doesn't work
[13:14:35] <ag4ve> Eviltwin++
[13:15:06] <Techy7> Yes, it is.
[13:16:25] <neumino> macmartine, I think if (your_property) { /* it works*/ } else { /* it doesn't */ }
[13:16:37] <NoReGreT> Techy7: is it dynamically created ?
[13:17:03] <Techy7> Heres the whole script that will not work: http://pastebin.com/z56aig3A
[13:17:03] <macmartine> neumino: you don't reference an object
[13:17:43] <neumino> machine1, replace your_property with your_object.property
[13:17:58] <neumino> If it is not supported, it should return undefined and shouldn't pass the if condition
[13:18:54] <macmartine> neumino: no, even this returns false 'console.log( $("#test").class );'
[13:19:07] <macmartine> and yes, the object exists, i output it on the previous line
[13:19:43] <NoReGreT> Techy7: surround that with 	$(document).ready(function() {
[13:20:10] <NoReGreT> Techy7: and why are you using getelementbyid... you're using jquery.. right ?
[13:20:16] <Techy7> Yeah
[13:20:19] <Techy7> I got lazy
[13:20:20] <Techy7> lol
[13:20:25] <Techy7> I was changing things a little
[13:20:28] <Techy7> NoRegret, so I can learn from this, why should it be in that?
[13:22:08] <NoReGreT> Techy7: using $('#id') should be lazy.. since it's much faster ;)
[13:22:36] <Techy7> NoReGreT: Oh and, it's not working still.
[13:23:32] <Techy7> Nevermind, I forgot to add the ); to it
[13:23:37] <NoReGreT> set everything up in jsfiddle and share the link

[13:42:51] <SmartTowel> anyone have a good demo for jquery ui/mysql calander?
[13:45:35] <filipiz> SmartTowel: what do you mean by mysql? why do you need database?
[13:45:37] <Sonderblade> SmartTowel: what does mysql have to do with it?
[13:46:08] <SmartTowel> i will be using the datepicker calander as a display for appointments.
[13:46:30] <SmartTowel> unless u have a better suggestion, i am open to hear about that.
[13:47:36] <Eruadan> hello, i'm looking to convert a flash animation to js/jquery. I'm new to jquery, although i know javascript. Would i be good to make this animation only with jquery or should i use some other libs, such as for tweening effects, etc..any ideas?
[13:48:15] <filipiz> SmartTowel: still didnt get the point... do you have any reference/example for that functionality that dont involves mysql?
[13:49:07] <SmartTowel> filipiz:  i got to a page, and there's a calander display (datepicker).  i want to be able to click on a day, and add an event for that day.
[13:49:19] <SmartTowel> i go*
[13:50:12] <filipiz> hmm..
[13:50:18] <filipiz> see the events tab on http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#events
[13:50:30] <filipiz> there is an onSelect event..
[13:51:01] <SmartTowel> we're using the term event differently.
[13:51:03] <filipiz> you can use it to make an ajax call to server side, which inserts an appointment on the DB
[13:51:35] <SmartTowel> i want to click on a day, and be able to add an 'appointment, meeting, etc' to the calander.  when i see the calander again, i want to see all of my scheduled appointments, meetings, etc.
[13:52:14] <filipiz> you want to see the dates that have appointments with different style, right?
[13:52:43] <SmartTowel> yea, so meetings in blue, lunch in red, etc etc
[13:53:13] <filipiz> https://www.google.com.br/search?ix=tea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=jquery+ui+calendar+highlight+date
[13:53:27] <filipiz> the first match is a good example..
[13:54:54] <wolfkit> I fixed my issue :)  I needed to set the keydown event for the new box to the function and set the keydown event for the old box to an empty one.  Everything works now :D
[13:56:14] <filipiz> SmartTowel: did that helped?
[13:57:55] <SmartTowel> not really.
[13:58:21] <SmartTowel> i just need a demo showing a calander that i can add appointments too.
[13:58:32] <SmartTowel> that article was about highlighting dates.
[14:00:42] <SmartTowel> this is what i was looking for filipiz

[14:00:48] <SmartTowel> but that u for your help.
[14:02:36] <YammYgirlcoding> hello guys! o/
[14:03:21] <YammYgirlcoding> I put a tiny plugin in my page, called the function as the example said, but nothing happens, the function gets ignored. I put some alerts but nothing. Any idea?
[14:03:24] <YammYgirlcoding> http://extremeforcemma.com/novosite/index.html
[14:03:46] <YammYgirlcoding> its the #scroller / simplyScroll
[14:04:52] <gehsekky> is it just me or are there like 4 doc ready blocks in there
[14:05:07] <YammYgirlcoding> where is that? there is?
[14:05:36] <YammYgirlcoding> i see one
[14:06:06] <gehsekky> jQuery(function () { }) is shorthand for jquery(document).ready({})
[14:06:30] <YammYgirlcoding> oh is it? aaahhh that might be that then. how should I write this?
[14:06:53] <YammYgirlcoding> (function($) { is also a shorthand?
[14:06:58] <gehsekky> no
[14:07:10] <gehsekky> that's usually a self-executing anonymous function
[14:07:29] <gehsekky> people use it to scope their code
[14:08:01] <YammYgirlcoding> hmm how should I rewrite the block of code then? I never know
[14:09:06] <kpoorman> its as if even though the img link is written into the dom using .innerHtml the browser is refusing to display it...
[14:12:05] <YammYgirlcoding> gehsekky i just tried to put all inside one document.ready place, but still nothing happens
[14:12:15] <YammYgirlcoding> please reload it
[14:12:41] <gehsekky> YammYgirlcoding: which plugin isn't working for you?
[14:12:58] <YammYgirlcoding> the simplyscroll
[14:13:06] <YammYgirlcoding> even the alert() is not printing as i expected
[14:13:17] <YammYgirlcoding> it seems it's not entering the doc.ready
[14:13:50] <gehsekky> are you familiar with using the javascript console?
[14:13:54] <YammYgirlcoding> yes
[14:14:04] <YammYgirlcoding> i put a breakpoint at the alert, but no print
[14:14:16] <gehsekky> if you look in the console, seems like you have some stuff not loaded
[14:14:21] <gehsekky> like your shadowbox stuff
[14:14:28] <YammYgirlcoding> an alert at first line after doc.ready shows, at the other hand
[14:14:38] <gehsekky> and superfish
[14:14:43] <YammYgirlcoding> yes i'm not using them anymore
[14:14:52] <YammYgirlcoding> this makes the other scripts stop working?
[14:14:53] <gehsekky> but you still have code in there that references them?
[14:15:30] <YammYgirlcoding> i may use them in future, just commented the code now.
[14:15:50] <YammYgirlcoding> aah that was the issue!
[14:16:07] <YammYgirlcoding> thanks a lot! i didn't know that missing scripts would stop the interpreter from continuing
[14:16:30] <gehsekky> np :)
[14:16:48] <gehsekky> btw, it looks like you still have your shadowbox stuff uncommented
[14:16:58] <gehsekky> should probably just comment it up if you want to use it in the future
[14:17:34] <YammYgirlcoding> oh you're right! commented now.
[14:17:45] <YammYgirlcoding> hmm the simplyscroll didn't work right ><
[14:17:49] <YammYgirlcoding> damit hehe
[14:17:54] <YammYgirlcoding> it's never easy!
[14:19:02] <gehsekky> if it were easy, we wouldn't get paid :P
[14:19:33] <YammYgirlcoding> hehe
[14:19:47] <YammYgirlcoding> it's weird! it's duplicating the scroller <li> many times
[14:24:33] <kmiklas12345> What's the best IRC app for android?
[14:25:29] <YammYgirlcoding> there is one? Oo
[14:26:59] <YammYgirlcoding> ah now it's perfect! =D
[14:27:43] <gehsekky> achievement unlocked: making javascript your bitch.
[14:28:25] <YammYgirlcoding> uhuu =D
[14:29:07] <NoReGreT> any idea why the extra data values aren't submitted? http://pastie.org/3543838 the selectors are correct, i checked them
[14:37:41] <c0d3rg1rl> Question: How can I avoid that safari selects the text in a text-input when using .focus()? WinXP, Firefox/IE show a blinking cursor, Safari selects the whole text, no cursor, example: http://jsfiddle.net/3rFyf/
[14:38:25] <cprodigy29> Hello!!
[14:38:59] <cprodigy29> I created a button that when you click it a div shows underneath it. How do I make the scroll bar automatically move down?
[14:39:13] <cprodigy29> Im using .slideDown();
[14:41:37] <eugenmayer> sorry to ask such a simle question
[14:41:46] <c0d3rg1rl> Variation of my question, does this also happen with a Mac? Don't have one here. http://jsfiddle.net/3rFyf/ - If you click the button, is the text selected afterwards or is a cursor in the field?
[14:41:53] <kmiklas12345> @c0d3rg1rl: maybe some variant of .select()
[14:41:59] <eugenmayer> but how to select all tables which do have the "sticky-enabled" class but not the "no-sticky" class?
[14:42:15] <eugenmayer> i saw the table[class=sticky-enabled][class!=no-sticky] way
[14:42:33] <eugenmayer> but this would me "exact match" and now other classes would be allowed, which wont work out
[14:43:11] <xp_prg> how do I encode a variable into a JSON string using jquery?
[14:43:37] <gehsekky> xp_prg: JSON.stringify() ?
[14:43:38] <cprodigy29> nevermind
[14:43:45] <xp_prg> oh ok thanks :>
[14:44:11] <tucan> hi, im trying to add link on my facebook fan page dynamically as i think a regular html link lowers the strength of my page in search engines, can someone give me directions of how to add facebook icon and link it using jquery only?
[14:44:24] <tucan> link to
[14:45:01] <c0d3rg1rl> kmiklas12345: Hm, no success with .select(), can't unselect
[14:45:32] <eugenmayer> table.sticky-enabled:not[class~=no-sticky]
[14:45:38] <eugenmayer> that does not work out either :/
[14:45:51] <kmiklas12345> @tucan: .html(<a><img></a> and then .attr("href","<facebook">) maybe?
[14:45:51] <danheberden> c0d3rg1rl you can do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/3rFyf/1/
[14:46:12] <gehsekky> eugenmayer: $('.sticky-enabled').not('.no-sticky')  ?
[14:46:33] <eugenmayer> gehsekky: isnt that the same as table.sticky-enabled:not[class~=no-sticky]  ?
[14:46:58] <c0d3rg1rl> danheberden: thanks, this works, now I have to figure out how and why ;-)
[14:47:20] <danheberden> c0d3rg1rl also, this, if the cursor at the end is ok: http://jsfiddle.net/3rFyf/2/
[14:47:26] <c0d3rg1rl> danheberden: is .get(0) necessary for a unique id?
[14:47:46] <danheberden> the first one works because you select the text from 0 to 0
[14:47:55] <danheberden> the second works because you destroy the selection
[14:48:19] <c0d3rg1rl> danheberden: fyi, second works only in safari, not firefox (on XP)
[14:48:59] <danheberden> c0d3rg1rl yeah, setSelectionRange is webkit only
[14:49:13] <danheberden> you'd have to createRange() yada yada in FF
[14:49:20] <danheberden> or just replace the content with the content
[14:50:18] <c0d3rg1rl> danheberden: ok, thanks a lot!
[14:51:05] <hobodave> hey guys
[14:51:48] <tucan> im thinking bout using this solution http://jquerybyexample.blogspot.com/2011/06/how-to-put-link-on-image-using-jquery.html
[14:52:00] <tucan> not sure if thats the correct way
[14:53:18] <hobodave> I'm working in an app in which some pages use "jQuery" since $ is blocked with jQuery.noConflict, however on some pages $ is used because there is no chance of conflict. I'm working in a Class now and I'm unsure how to ensure that $ is always defined to be the jQuery object within this class. The only thing I see to do is pass it in via the constructor, but then I have to refer to it as this.$ in other methods. Is there a standard s
[14:53:19] <hobodave>  for this?
[14:53:57] <hobodave> that, or inside every method do var $ = jQuery
[15:04:03] <ag4ve> why are my calls to addMemDat() function failing?
[15:04:20] <ag4ve> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/185689
[15:11:21] <scttnlsn> is there an event that is triggered when a node is appended to the dom?
[15:11:59] <danheberden> scttnlsn not on all browsers, but https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/DOM_event_reference
[15:12:57] <scttnlsn> hmm
[15:13:01] <scttnlsn> ok
[15:13:45] <scttnlsn> is there any other event that would be triggered as soon as an element as a size?
[15:13:50] <scttnlsn> *has a size
[15:14:35] <scttnlsn> i want to know when a node becomes visible
[15:17:01] <ag4ve> scttnlsn: might try sticking a listener on window and see what that does...
[15:23:55] <Grafica> I have an "includes" header.php file that does not contain <head> nor <body> tags, and I wanted to incorporate jQuery into it. jQuery requires the library to be in the <head> tag, but is it proper to code
[15:24:17] <Grafica> the head & body tags in an include file?
[15:26:27] <ag4ve> Grafica: doesn't matter, include it in the body - works fine
[15:27:03] <ag4ve> really, you probably should include it at the body so that your html can render before scripts start taking up time.
[15:27:11] <Grafica> I don't have body tags.
[15:27:20] <ag4ve> .... better user experience
[15:27:34] <ag4ve> Grafica: what do you mean, 'you don't have body tags'?
[15:27:53] <Grafica> Hahaha...
[15:27:55] <ag4ve> are you using jq outside a web page or you have improper html?
[15:29:49] <Grafica> I have an index.php file, and an include stmt. <?php
[15:29:49] <Grafica> include "header.html"; ?> Then, in the header.html file, there are no head nor body tags.
[15:30:45] <ag4ve> right, but when the php engine renders your page, it puts those tags there, right?
[15:31:11] <Grafica> I don't know.
[15:31:20] <Grafica> The page looks good.
[15:31:31] <ag4ve> <script> can be placed where ever the hell you want (god knows they did with all of the template toolkit pages here)
[15:31:37] <miha> <?php $file=file("header.html"); echo $file; ?>
[15:32:32] <andrew___> ewww. php
[15:32:39] <Grafica> miha: What do you mean? That's what I should place in my php file?
[15:32:41] <ag4ve> *shrug* don't do php, but i'm assuming it slurps file into that variable and then writes it out. so, unless you have something above or below... no
[15:32:49] <kpoorman> What could cause an image tag inserted into the dom via innerHtml() to not be rendered by the browser ?
[15:32:55] <miha> Grafica, yes.
[15:33:19] <Grafica> Thanks.
[15:34:30] * ag4ve wonders how php is still viable now days....
[15:34:43] <astropirate> ag4ve, why wouldn't it be? o_O
[15:34:58] <Grafica> ag4ve: Yea, why not?
[15:35:33] <astropirate> If I wasn't coding on Node.js i'd definatly be doing PHP :)
[15:35:50] <ag4ve> well, at work, i use perl, tt, js....... at home, i use node - simpler
[15:36:13] <astropirate> Anyone looking for a freelance JS dev?
[15:38:18] <Grafica> miha: So I don't need head & body tags in the header.html file, right?
[15:40:52] <miha> Grafica, 'header.html' can be included in the HTML file. But it is alsonecessary to specifyin phpthatis createdishtml,nottext.
[15:43:20] <Grafica> miha: 'header.html' is included in the index.php file.
[15:45:21] <miha> Grafica, no.  'header.html' will be part of the informationissued by the browser
[15:46:18] <Grafica> miha: maybe I should post my code.
[15:46:43] <miha> Grafica, ok
[15:47:00] <Grafica> miha: OK, where?
[15:47:29] <miha> Grafica, kymap21@mail.ru
[15:48:03] <jose___> tablesorter in php?
[15:48:21] <jose___> can anyone help pls?
[15:48:30] <RichardK> Howdy all... question, so I have a mobile site running on JQM which calls $.mobile.silentScroll during a page transition.  What's odd is, the script doesn't scroll... yet if I set a breakpoint at that particular line and enter the same JS in the console it scrolls just fine.
[15:48:49] <jose___> tablesorter in php?
[15:48:58] <RichardK> ah
[15:49:01] <RichardK> will go to #jquerymobile
[15:49:42] <tw2113> NERDS!
[15:49:55] <BinaryKitten> you called?
[15:50:16] <tw2113> not lately
[15:50:54] <BinaryKitten> too right you haven't. Your <parent/guardian/sibling/person of interest> is so worried
[15:51:54] <kpoorman> specifically my oLang specification says "sProcessing": "<img src='/assets/ajax-loader.gif'>", which seems valid
[15:53:57] <styol> kpoorman: does yoursite.com/assets/ajaz-loader.gif work?
[15:54:08] <styol> *ajax-loader.gif
[15:54:10] <kpoorman> styol: yes.
[15:54:47] <kpoorman> styol: it's really got me frustrated. it's like chrome is just refusing to render the image for some reason
[15:54:55] <styol> kpoorman: this is not the issue but just to let you know, / before > is recommended
[15:55:07] <kpoorman> fixing.
[15:55:10] <styol> kpoorman: is it being rendered in an element that is hidden or otherwise? perhaps just put some text or something to verify
[15:55:44] <kpoorman> styol: if I put text there, the text shows up, and I can see the img tag in the html, but no image in the browser
[15:55:57] <kpoorman> the / before > makes no difference in this case
[15:57:20] <kpoorman> styol: this (answer) is exactly what i'm doing, but no dice. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5648643/want-to-show-loader-gif-in-datatables
[15:57:24] <styol> kpoorman: yeah thats strange, it should work if you can access that url.. firebug for instance tries to load a specified image url when you hover the url, but the / is just a validation thing, it is comparable to a closure since img, input, etc don't have </img>
[15:57:37] <Snerf> anyone work with Rangy. I am trying to change the selected text by wrapping a '<span>' around it, using surroundContents, in an iframe.. and am just stuck
[15:58:40] <styol> kpoorman: when you put the img there without jquery it works?
[15:58:51] <kpoorman> yep
[15:59:11] <styol> strange, yeah i haven't experienced the same issues and just did this like yesterday
[16:00:25] <styol> kpoorman: innerHTML()? have you tried html()
[16:00:41] <kpoorman> styol: the actual insertion is done by the datatables jquery plugin
[16:00:49] <kpoorman> I've read the code to see that it's an innerHtml call
[16:00:53] <styol> oh
[16:01:53] <Ali1331> hi
[16:02:33] <Ali1331> I'm having some trouble detaching and prepending an object, my page basically has 2 divs next to each up and an 'up' button that is supposed to bring the lower one onto the top http://jsfiddle.net/pJLNJ/ isn't working and I'm not sure why
[16:02:46] <eddiemonge> anyone have ie6 handy? a true ie6 install?
[16:03:05] <Ali1331> http://pastebin.com/gvAVFpcy * better code
[16:03:08] <jason_stoudt> eddiemonge: I got ie6 in a VM
[16:03:11] <Ali1331> fiddle seemed to cut it off
[16:03:41] <eddiemonge> jason_stoudt: could you hit http://www.etiger13.com/ and tell me if it shows any errors or warnings?
[16:03:49] <Ali1331> actually scrap both of those, that one has ruby in it heh -----> http://pastebin.com/Hpd5KE2N
[16:03:50] <kpoorman> styol: this is the html it's generating
[16:03:50] <kpoorman> https://gist.github.com/1997438
[16:03:53] <eddiemonge> the page is purposely blank
[16:03:54] <Ali1331> thats what the browser gets
[16:04:26] <Ali1331> no errors eddiemonge just a blank page
[16:04:39] <eddiemonge> no security warnings?
[16:04:40] <jason_stoudt> eddiemonge: no js errors
[16:04:43] <dame_dudder> howdy dudes
[16:04:54] <jason_stoudt> eddiemonge: no other messages of any kind
[16:05:19] <dame_dudder> ok so.. check this out http://jsfiddle.net/pPzHX/
[16:05:34] <eddiemonge> jason_stoudt: thanks
[16:05:37] <Ali1331> anyone have any ideas why http://pastebin.com/Hpd5KE2N does nothing?
[16:05:37] <hobodave> hmm
[16:05:45] <jason_stoudt> eddiemonge: np
[16:05:52] <dame_dudder> actually this one
[16:05:53] <dame_dudder> http://jsfiddle.net/pPzHX/1/
[16:06:03] <hobodave> How do I access the object referred to by "this" in the outside scope of an $.each() loop?
[16:06:05] <eddiemonge> Ali1331: because id uses # and not . ?
[16:06:14] <hobodave> $.each overwrites this to be the object iterated over
[16:06:14] <dame_dudder> so the issue i'm having is that when I click an LI it shows both dropdowns
[16:06:19] <styol> kpoorman: seems fine
[16:06:25] <eddiemonge> Ali1331: and the detach is unnecessary
[16:06:37] <Eviltwin> hobodave: Use a variable or $.proxy
[16:06:41] <dame_dudder> I want it so if I click one, it shows the ul in THAT specific li
[16:06:56] <dame_dudder> not all
[16:07:05] <dame_dudder> i'm having issues there
[16:07:06] <Ali1331> why is it unnecessary I thought I had to remove it to put it somewhere else
[16:07:19] <eddiemonge> Ali1331: nope
[16:07:32] <eddiemonge> Ali1331: prepend, prependto, append, appendto, move the element
[16:07:50] <Ali1331> oh, cheers eddie
[16:07:51] <hobodave> Eviltwin do you mean var outside = this; $.each(collection, function() { outside.foo = 'bar'; }) ?
[16:07:51] <dame_dudder> and if I click the li again it removes class to specific ul
[16:08:16] <dame_dudder> so the same behavior for both LIs
[16:08:20] <Eviltwin> hobodave: Correct
[16:08:33] <dame_dudder> that's it
[16:08:35] <hobodave> cludgy
[16:08:41] <Eviltwin> Ali1331: Also be careful when using .remove()
[16:08:49] <Eviltwin> It unbinds listeners and deletes associated data
[16:08:57] <Eviltwin> You'd want .detach() for moving something to a new place
[16:09:35] <Ali1331> hmm if I click up and then up on the bottom one again they both vanish
[16:09:49] <eddiemonge> yeah, .detach() is when you want to take it out of the DOM temporarily
[16:09:55] <eddiemonge> remove deletes it
[16:09:58] <Ali1331> that's what I thought...
[16:10:55] <Ali1331> why do they vanish when I try to flip them back again?
[16:11:01] <Ali1331> even with detach
[16:11:29] <Eviltwin> You're likely doing something in the wrong order
[16:11:38] <Eviltwin> Or reselecting when you shouldn't
[16:11:44] <humanBird> so, how hard is it to do mousewheel events these days? I know you guys say "no ie6 or ie7 support plz" but
[16:12:16] <Ali1331> browser is getting http://pastebin.com/mXBA1kFf
[16:12:21] <Ali1331> both events are in there
[16:13:20] <Eviltwin> You realize that you can (and should) do var t = $("#16").prev(); t.prenend(...), right?
[16:13:23] <Eviltwin> prepend*
[16:13:39] <Eviltwin> Not necessary to reselect
[16:13:47] <Eviltwin> And wasteful since you already had a handle to the element
[16:14:23] <Ali1331> ye it was something I tried when it wasn't working
[16:14:40] <Ali1331> I just need them to stay when being moved around a lot
[16:14:48] <Ali1331> they keep vanishing completely
[16:16:07] <Ali1331> these are actually ajax responses, because I couldnt get onclick to work, it kept submitting the form they were contained in :/
[16:16:08] <eddiemonge> Ali1331: is prepend what you want? or insertBefore?
[16:16:08] <nFFF> Eviltwin, how hard would it be to create adobe pen tool functionality in javascript
[16:16:16] <nFFF> to be able to draw/edit 2d images
[16:17:05] <eddiemonge> nFFF: not hard. blackberry has a canvas drawing example you can use. or you can try and figure out Paul irish's site
[16:17:45] <Ali1331> ah thats it eddie, cheers
[16:17:53] <Ali1331> jquery confuses me to hell
[16:18:00] <nFFF> eddiemonge, his is just strokes
[16:18:03] <nFFF> not actual pen tool
[16:18:08] <nFFF> where you can curve it etc
[16:19:35] <eddiemonge> Ali1331: var t = $("#16"); t.insertBefore( t.prev() );
[16:21:46] <Ali1331> is there anyway to do like if(!t,prev()) so I don't end up "Up"'ing it outside of where I want it
[16:21:46] <Ali1331> ?
[16:21:52] <Ali1331> t.prev*
[16:26:35] <Ali1331> nvm I got it!
[16:29:07] <eddiemonge> Ali1331: doesnt need it http://jsfiddle.net/ArMAC/
[16:29:24] <Ali1331> err it did
[16:29:34] <Ali1331> I managed to down' it off the page
[16:29:44] <eddiemonge> Ali1331: do they have a wrapper?
[16:29:46] <Ali1331> oh, different code
[16:29:49] <eddiemonge> look at my example
[16:30:00] <Ali1331> no I don't have those click wrappers
[16:31:14] <eddiemonge> you dont have a wrapper around your sortable list?
[16:31:55] <Ali1331> err no
[16:43:52] <hobodave> is there a convenient way to be sure that $ refers to jQuery inside every method of a class without having to explicitly define var $ = jQuery() at the top of each method?
[16:45:43] <iateadonut> interesting.  i thought it already did that.
[16:46:05] <hobodave> iateadonut not if somewhere outside of the class jQuery.noConflict() has been called
[16:46:05] <IceTrAiN> as did i
[16:46:08] <MikeyD> what do you call that thing that can appear in the corner of a page and usually contains a graphic and link?
[16:46:28] <IceTrAiN> MikeyD: annoying? :D
[16:47:23] <Paul_Linney> hobodave: You can wrap all your code in - (function ($) { // all your code here })(jQuery);
[16:47:55] <hobodave> Paul_Linney I find that to be less than optimal. Then I don't have the class available in the global namespace
[16:48:05] <hobodave> or actually in any namespace besides the enclosing function
[16:48:20] <Paul_Linney> aye, that is a drawback
[16:48:31] <MikeyD> IceTrAiN: have you ever seen an implementation of what im talking about that isnt annoying?
[16:48:57] <hobodave> not stirring anything up, but I come from Prototype. Anecdotally, why do you think jQuery seems to have come out as the framework of choice for so many developers?
[16:49:16] <hobodave> do people just grok functional programming better?
[16:49:19] <IceTrAiN> MikeyD: just playing with you.. i'm not even entirely sure of what you're referring to :D
[16:50:33] <hobodave> Paul_Linney it'd be nice if I could somehow pass jQuery to the constructor of the class and have that be magically available in all scopes within that object
[17:02:42] <LekeFly> Does all browers support putting js at the bottom.. ? is there some js you cant put at the bottom.. ?
[17:02:59] <mikycoccinella91> ciao
[17:03:02] <mikycoccinella91> !list
[17:03:42] <Paul_Linney> hobodave: In the constructor you could try setting a default param as `new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context );` ?
[17:04:46] <kurrent> recommendations for vertical carousel/slider?
[17:05:44] <Paul_Linney> kurrent: jquery cycle or sliderkit
[17:05:47] <kingnebula> LekeFly, you can put all of your JS at the bottom. And you should

[18:13:43] <chovy> jason_stoudt: where do i read more about it?
[18:14:30] <jason_stoudt> chovy: here's a good place to get started: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:34:28] <xp_prg> is there some easy way to determine if a form has been changed?
[18:41:13] <ndss56> xp_prg: yes
[18:41:29] <xp_prg> is there a plugin or something?
[18:41:59] <z1000> is there a way to wrap an inner text element... ex <a>some text</a> to <a><span>sometext</a>
[18:42:15] <z1000> err <a><span>text</span></a>
[18:43:21] <xp_prg> ndss56 what is it?
[18:43:52] <ndss56> xp_prg: what do you mean by 'form has been changed'?
[18:44:03] <xp_prg> the initial values on the form
[18:44:27] <chovy> jason_stoudt: thanks. Do you know if it's possible to destroy all events for a given namespace?
[18:44:41] <z1000> lol wrapInner wow
[18:47:35] <ndss56> xp_prg: you use jquery to validate your form inputs and compare them to initial values. If they are different then theres been a change.
[18:47:52] <xp_prg> yes but is there a plugin so I don't have to recreate the wheel?
[18:48:43] <Linex_> Hi. I'm using $.get() function. The first parameter which points to a backend file. I want it to point to itself. What do I write ?
[18:49:17] <ag4ve> does jquery have a way of selecting all items exept one besides .each? ie, i'd like to do one .remove
[18:51:54] <chovy> Linex_: you want to get the current page?
[18:52:03] <Linex_> chovy, yes
[18:52:28] <chovy> $.get(window.location, function(htm) { //do somethign with htm });]
[18:52:43] <ndss56> xp_prg: no, because every form is different. there is no general form.
[18:55:10] <Linex_> chovy: thnaks
[18:55:26] <iLogic> ag4ve: inside that each function you check with an if statement
[18:55:38] <iLogic> ag4ve: by check I mean verify
[18:56:05] <iLogic> xp_prg: what you really need after all?
[18:57:01] <Linex_> chovy: is $.get() overloaded
[18:58:21] <ag4ve> iLogic: right, if (i>1) { this.remove; } but then i write to the dom potentially 200+ times.
[18:58:41] <xp_prg> iLogic I need a way to know if a form has been changed from its initial values
[18:58:53] <iLogic> xp_prg: what for?
[18:59:12] <xp_prg> so I can tell the user they didn't change anything and then don't submit to the server
[18:59:53] <iLogic> ag4ve: I don't get what you were trying to do at first.. are you actually selecting a checkbox?
[19:00:57] <ag4ve> though, i guess the obvious alternative to trying to be fancy is to just store the option's that i want in a variable and .remove them before i rebuild it
[19:01:29] <ag4ve> iLogic: i'm trying to remove all of the <option> but two in a <select>
[19:01:41] <iLogic> ag4ve: just stop being mr. fancy pants
[19:03:07] <iLogic> xp_prg: choose one: http://speckyboy.com/2009/12/17/10-useful-jquery-form-validation-techniques-and-tutorials-2/
[19:03:17] <iLogic> you guys don't like to google much huh?
[19:05:37] <xp_prg> yes I do actually
[19:05:50] <xp_prg> just don't like doing it for hours on end if someone knows a best practice
[19:11:41] <iLogic> xp_prg: dude, that took 2 secs.. now you check for which one have the kind of fields you're using and done! what hours?
[19:17:33] <esiegel> Hey everyone, I'm trying to put together a simple menu bar. All the links are anchors on the single page of the site. When you click a link it should .addClass('active') to that link and .removeClass('active') to all of the others. Is there a better way of doing this besides writing out all of the combinations possible? I've been toying around with :not() but I'm not having much luck. Thanks!
[19:18:21] <esiegel> You can see the work in progress at http://casablanca.siegels.me
[19:22:58] <chovy> Linex_: I don't know what you mean by overloaded.
[19:23:46] <dame_dudder> iLogic ?
[19:24:01] <dame_dudder> though we fixed the problem ealier
[19:24:05] <dame_dudder> i'm still curious
[19:24:08] <chovy> esiegel: sounds like something I did with jQuery.tabbed()
[19:24:15] <dame_dudder> what's the difference between
[19:24:47] <dame_dudder>  ul > li > ul
[19:24:55] <dame_dudder> and
[19:24:59] <dame_dudder> $(this).children('ul')
[19:25:21] <dame_dudder> like why wouldn't the first do exactly as the second
[19:25:50] <iLogic> dame_dudder: the first applies to all ul > li > ul, the second applies only the specific element you got with a click, hover or whatever..
[19:25:54] <chovy> dame_dudder: > is a child selector
[19:26:13] <dame_dudder> ahh
[19:26:14] <dame_dudder> there we go
[19:26:17] <iLogic> chovy: he means the broad selector vs. the specific
[19:26:17] <dame_dudder> make sense
[19:26:25] <dame_dudder> yea exactly
[19:26:42] <chovy> is $(this).children('ul') faster than $(this).find('ul'); ?
[19:26:47] <iLogic> yup
[19:26:55] <chovy> it just goes one level?
[19:27:11] <chovy> or why is it faster?
[19:27:13] <iLogic> only then you could use next()
[19:27:17] <iLogic> that's even faster
[19:27:22] <esiegel> chovy: I just looked around for .tabbed() and couldn't find anything
[19:27:42] <iLogic> because find looks around transversely and in all levels
[19:27:59] <iLogic> and children goes directly to the level specified
[19:30:36] <chovy> does this work? $(this).children("ul li");
[19:30:46] <chovy> I havne' used .children before
[19:32:54] <iLogic> you can grain it like $(this).children('ul').children('li')
[19:33:11] <iLogic> and go back with parent()
[19:33:11] <chovy> i would just use .find() then
[19:33:49] <iLogic> I think he already did the best, $('ul > li > ul')
[19:33:56] <iLogic> imo
[19:34:11] <iLogic> that's the fastest and cleanest
[19:34:25] <chovy> why not juse $('ul ul')
[19:34:36] <iLogic> precision :)
[19:35:25] <iLogic> I enjoy it like John Travolta on a watch advertising wearing a pilot's jacket
[19:39:58] <dame_dudder> well actually I used both
[19:39:59] <dame_dudder> http://jsfiddle.net/pPzHX/2/
[19:40:31] <dame_dudder> I had to use children because I needed the specific element
[19:40:39] <dame_dudder> :)
[19:41:02] <dame_dudder> btw
[19:41:13] <dame_dudder> after I found out about '>'
[19:41:17] <dame_dudder> fell in love
[19:41:24] <dame_dudder> I can't stop using it now
[19:42:13] <iLogic> if you transverse the dom like a ninja, > is like a shoriuken
[19:43:11] <dame_dudder> lol

[19:56:21] <dame_dudder> lol
[19:56:24] <sneakyness> everything is listed there
[19:56:29] <sneakyness> EV ER Y THIN GUH
[19:56:36] <sneakyness> the one you want is at the top btw
[19:56:39] <sneakyness> gj reading
[19:56:41] <arlink> theres no need to shout the lords name in vein
[19:56:48] <sneakyness> jesus christ is no lord
[19:57:10] <arlink> sneakyness, he is your lord and savior
[19:57:11] <dame_dudder> the gods are watching over both you..
[19:57:14] <dame_dudder> beware!
[19:57:19] <tw2113> stop taking my name in vain
[19:57:29] <sneakyness> tw2113: sorry jesus
[19:57:40] <tw2113> everyone's forgiven, carry on
[19:57:45] <dame_dudder> thank you tw2113
[19:57:55] <Hexasquid> tw2113++
[19:57:55] <coldhead> please refrain from discussing religion unless it's related to jQuery
[19:58:07] <tw2113> there's a plugin for it
[19:58:10] <coldhead> like "did you see the jQuery on the new vatican site? sure makes up for some of that child abuse"
[19:58:27] <dame_dudder> coldhead
[19:58:27] <caniuse> dame_dudder: coldhead: a brand new person to jQuery. Ignore at all costs!!!!!
[19:58:31] <dame_dudder> totally related
[19:58:43] <dame_dudder> i'm using a unique ID of jesus
[19:58:46] <Hexasquid> Do you accept jQuery as your personal selector?
[19:58:49] <dame_dudder> #jesus as an input
[19:59:11] <coldhead> top hole, Hexasquid, top hole
[19:59:26] <dame_dudder> #jesus * {}
[19:59:48] <dame_dudder> pretty much you can select everything with this selector arlink
[20:00:09] <coldhead> the descendents of jesus have no properties? actually i think that was in the da vinci code
[20:00:32] <arlink> ("div") <--- it confuses me when people put more than one element inside here. thats what i need to understand
[20:01:04] <arlink> (#bodycontent li ul) things like this
[20:01:12] <Hexasquid> $('#jesus').children()
[20:01:27] <Hexasquid> It's like CSS
[20:01:37] <Hexasquid> Becomes more specific
[20:02:09] <arlink> but what does ('#bodycontent li ul')  mean?
[20:02:12] <Hexasquid> $('ul li') <-- select the li's within the ul
[20:02:40] <iLogic> I thought Jesus had no children..
[20:02:46] <Hexasquid> That would select ul's within li's within th #bodything
[20:02:47] <dame_dudder> #bodycontent li ul = any ul within li that's within #bodycontent ?
[20:02:51] <arlink> ('#bodycontent ul li') select the li's within the ul of #bodycontent?
[20:03:03] <dame_dudder> bingo.
[20:03:10] <Hexasquid> sanp
[20:03:38] <arlink> ('.jesus > a') whats with that greater than sign?
[20:03:55] <dame_dudder> :) greater sign are my best friend!
[20:04:08] <Hexasquid> All the anchors inside your .jesus
[20:04:16] <Hexasquid> Directly inside
[20:04:19] <dame_dudder> check that
[20:04:22] <coldhead> > means the immediate child
[20:04:25] <tw2113> from someone else: if($('#jesus').children() == $('.us')){alert('Hallelujah!!!');}
[20:04:26] <coldhead> no grandchildren
[20:04:27] <arlink> anchors is a fancy term for elements
[20:04:41] <dame_dudder> what coldhead said..
[20:04:46] <coldhead> if only you could compare jQ sets like that, tw2113
[20:04:48] <arlink> coldhead, ah i see
[20:04:57] <Hexasquid> An anchor is one of many types of elements
[20:04:58] <tw2113> === ?
[20:05:58] <arlink> someone should right a blog about complex selectors like 	('#bodycontent ul li') , seriously
[20:06:04] <arlink> just a heads up for u guys
[20:06:16] <Hexasquid> There is one, it's on the internet
[20:06:17] <dame_dudder> arlink i got one for you

[20:06:55] <dame_dudder> you can wire me some cash with that
[20:07:10] <dame_dudder> and then thank jesus
[20:07:30] <arlink> dame_dudder, ooooh now i see. i didnt get you the first time when you said css selectors
[20:07:32] <coldhead> tw2113: sadly not, even this doesn't work $('body') === $('body')
[20:07:44] <tw2113> *kicks dirt*
[20:07:50] <coldhead> it's the worst thing ever
[20:07:50] <dame_dudder> correct it was Hexasquid that said css
[20:07:55] <dame_dudder> correction*
[20:08:47] <arlink> this is gold!!
[20:09:00] <dame_dudder> you're send me that check right?
[20:09:08] <dame_dudder> i wasn't playing

[20:13:54] <dame_dudder> but it really is
[20:14:22] <coldhead> the safest browser is netcat
[20:14:23] <dame_dudder> i can't wait till chrome canary of now is officially released
[20:14:26] <coldhead> and the human heart

[20:35:14] <jQuery_newbie> I need help with a bit of code.  I have a face-book like slider that I am woking on for my standalone site
[20:37:21] <jQuery_newbie> The div where the fb content is located is hidden until a user activiates it by hovering the mouse on a button but it will only re-hides after toggling the button again, but I just want it to hides even if I exit its div without toggling the button.
[20:37:53] <jQuery_newbie> my code is this:
[20:37:58] <jQuery_newbie> (function(){
[20:38:02] <aaairc> could anyone recommend a tutorial on how to do Object Oriented Programming in Jquery? I know the basics of jquery... using a selector... writing a basic function... but that is it. I come from a Java background.
[20:38:03] <iLogic> not cool
[20:38:20] <jQuery_newbie> What's not cool?
[20:38:26] <iLogic> pasting it
[20:38:39] <jQuery_newbie> I didn't, I was about to type it in
[20:39:10] <iLogic> you wasted a line making sure the dom is ready with humans
[20:40:46] <jQuery_newbie> how do you want me to show you the code I have....it's only 6 lines, but I am having trouble with an extra "add-on" I want on it.
[20:41:20] <Es0teric> i have multiple items that i want to be able to show/hide on click so i want to click a <li> then show the content from another element
[20:42:58] <coldhead> ?p @ jQuery_newbie

[20:45:22] <aaairc> in this example (function() {var x = 1;})();       ----- what is the significance of wrapping function in parentheses? and why is there another () at the end?
[20:45:41] <aaairc> source of the example:  http://docs.jquery.com/Types#Scope
[20:46:15] <jQuery_newbie> aaairc: is the same as writing $(document).function(){ "content" });  except is the short version of it.
[20:47:26] <aaairc> why do you have a ")" at the end of your example?
[20:47:49] <danzik171> jQuery_newbie: no, it's not.  you're referring to $(function() {}).  what aaairc is asking about is called an IIFE
[20:48:47] <jQuery_newbie> Ahh, ok!  <--- newbie!
[20:48:51] <aaairc> lol

[20:58:54] <aaairc> is there a way to find out the name of the function from within the function?

[20:59:03] <aaairc> http://jsfiddle.net/mbPYC/
[21:00:01] <aaairc> but basically if i have function makeCounter(){}, and then var counter = makeCounter().... is there a way to find out from within makeCounter that it is being called by "counter"?
[21:00:03] <aqeel> hi room
[21:00:08] <aaairc> hi
[21:01:51] <aaairc> i think i misunderstood my example. nevermind.
[21:11:50] <aqeel> ok how should i be doing this.....any idea.....if i want to implement a progress bar which is based on contents loading into the div and then loads page........sould i use plugin or direct jquery
[21:12:25] <aqeel> i would like to have the shortest possible way

[21:17:07] <aqeel> thanks
[21:18:47] <VoiDeT> Hey, Trying to use .css({opacity: 0}) on a UL, the bg of the UL is 0 but the text content still is 100%, this is on IE8 only, ie7 & 9 are fine

[21:22:22] <VoiDeT> haha nice coldhead, you forgot to test for ie8 first :P
[21:23:54] <coldhead> not at all, VoiDeT, i want non ie8 users to know that they're doing the right thing
[21:24:06] <coldhead> everyone needs to know the site's stance wrt ie8
[21:24:25] <VoiDeT> there you go, i would rather not remind people i.e. exists
[21:24:25] <aaairc> would people recommend the module pattern discussed here http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/#viewSource   as a way to start doing OOP in jQuery? are there other patterns i should look at?
[21:26:18] <Cork> aaairc: well its not really a way to do oop, but yes scoping is a good practis
[21:27:25] <aaairc> Cork: would you recommend and OOP tutorials for javascript/jquery?
[21:27:42] <Cork> aaairc: javascript is oop by nature
[21:27:49] <aqeel> well coldhead that is making use of 2 more core libraries..    UI Core     UI Widget and the progressbar itself.....is there no any simpler ..???
[21:27:59] <Cork> every thing you handle is objects
[21:28:07] <coldhead> aaairc: anything ben alman suggests is probably right on, but see also addy osmani's extensive writings on JS patterns and OO
[21:28:10] <arlink> can each() skip undefined elements?
[21:28:20] <coldhead> aqeel: it's not a simple thing
[21:28:24] <coldhead> you can try it yourself
[21:28:34] <coldhead> but there's no "progress meter in 3 lines of code" that i've ever seen
[21:28:37] <coldhead> i am sorry :(
[21:29:02] <coldhead> arlink: if (! thing) return;
[21:29:04] <aqeel> thanks then i get to google
[21:29:05] <coldhead> that will skip it
[21:29:09] <Cork> aqeel: you could make the progressbar with a few line of css two form elements and one line of js
[21:29:23] <coldhead> aqeel: do whatever Cork says
[21:30:42] <aqeel> well cork guess that is what i am looking for
[21:34:26] <Cork> aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/GwxRc/
[21:34:40] <Cork> the only needed js line is indicator.style.width = (value++) + '%';
[21:34:47] <Cork> the rest is just animation shuger
[21:34:53] <Cork> *souger
[21:35:10] <arlink> coldhead, if(!$(this)==null)
[21:36:01] <coldhead> $(anyting) will never == null
[21:36:18] <coldhead> it's just the empty jquery set
[21:36:22] <aqeel> thanks
[21:36:40] <Cork> and $(this) won't ever be empty
[21:36:47] <coldhead> Cork: UR sugar
[21:36:58] <Cork> coldhead: ha... thx

[21:48:30] <aaairc> i'm looking at the Module Pattern here:  http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjquery
[21:48:42] <aaairc> I'm confused by a part of the example they give.
[21:49:01] <aaairc> how is it that you can do "new Plugin;"
[21:49:07] <aaairc> i've never seen "new" used before
[21:50:39] <aaairc> so the line that is used specifically is.... "var myPlugin = new Plugin;"
[21:52:40] <codeWarrior42> Hi! Can anyone hear me???
[21:53:15] <aaairc> i can read you
[21:53:44] <codeWarrior42> Sweet. First time connecting from my phone
[21:59:20] <codeWarrior42> Is it possible to use .delegate() without a container; something like the syntax of. .bind()?
[22:00:30] <aaairc> what does "new" do?
[22:01:49] <aaairc> codeWarrior42: do you know what "new" does?
[22:03:00] <codeWarrior42> Instantiates a new object
[22:03:04] <joedj> aaairc: http://www.bwigg.com/2011/01/javascripts-new-operator/
[22:03:38] <ajpiano> codeWarrior42: if you use $("#foo").on("click", fn) it works identically to what you're familiar with for .bind
[22:04:05] <codeWarrior42> I'm not using 1.7.1
[22:04:12] <coldhead> old school
[22:04:18] <ajpiano> oh
[22:04:30] <ajpiano> no, delegate is a helper for event delegation
[22:04:32] <ajpiano> use bind if you want bind
[22:04:38] <ajpiano> you can use bind to do event delegation if you want
[22:04:40] <codeWarrior42> So I need to use .delegate() directly
[22:04:53] <systemfault> You only need .on :P
[22:04:59] * systemfault flees
[22:05:00] <ajpiano> i have no idea what you need to do as i have no insight into your actual problem
[22:05:27] <codeWarrior42> I can't use bind bc the elements ate being added dynamically
[22:05:50] <ajpiano> well that's certainly not true
[22:06:27] <sahbeewah> why would you need to use delegate without a container
[22:06:36] <ajpiano> there is a *sense* in which that statement is true but it is essentially false
[22:06:57] <sahbeewah> at the very worst you can use, "body"
[22:07:03] <ajpiano> codeWarrior42: what do you mean by "use delegate without a container"
[22:07:06] <ajpiano> exactly
[22:07:15] <ajpiano> you would use $(document).delegate(....)
[22:07:22] <ajpiano> if you want to do it on the whole thing
[22:08:24] <codeWarrior42> I want to dynamically add an elemnent and attach an event handler thereto with .delegate()
[22:08:45] <ajpiano> nothing is stopping you from doing that with either .bind or .delegate
[22:09:17] <ajpiano> $("<div>").appendTo(document.body).bind("click", fn);
[22:10:43] <codeWarrior42> That's not the best technique.
[22:10:59] <ajpiano> um, ok

[22:14:21] <ajpiano> my bad
[22:36:48] <Whirl3dOrd3r> Evening all. I can add elements to a jquery object using .add, but how do I remove them (without touching them in the dom)? Is there a shortcut or do I have to use filter to filter out the unwanted elements?
[22:37:17] <ajpiano> .filter, .not, .slice, will all do the trick
[22:38:13] <Whirl3dOrd3r> coll=coll.not(":disabled")   wow, I'm not sure why I didn't think of that. Thanks for the reply.
[22:38:26] <munderwo> Hi all. Im doing CORS with cookies and jquery 1.7.1, i've managed to get it to work on chrome, but it doesnt seem to work in Firefox. I've got the withCredentials: true xhrfield and the crossDomain: true when using $.ajax(), is there anything else I need to implement?
[22:40:44] <Whirl3dOrd3r> in the function declaration: function funcName(param1, param2) { do something} what is the best way to check if the value passed in param1 was a string (to be a selector) or a jquery object? I have tried a couple different ways, but wondered what the best was.
[22:41:22] <ajpiano> Whirl3dOrd3r: param.jquery
[22:41:32] <Whirl3dOrd3r> munderwo, sorry I'm not familiar with CORS, sorry.
[22:41:34] <ajpiano> param1 = param1.jquery ? param1 : $(param1)
[22:41:53] <munderwo> Whirl3dOrd3R: thanks anyway
[22:42:05] <Whirl3dOrd3r> ajpiano, so eloquent. Thanks a lot. Much nicer than the 3 or 4 lines of messy code I had written. LOL
[22:52:03] <Mario204> hello
[22:52:13] <Mario204> is anyone online who could help me with jquery troubles in IE ?
[22:52:19] <Mario204> my submit button not working
[22:52:36] <__composern> is some one using jquery datatables + jquery ui ?
[22:52:44] <Mario204> jquery ui
[22:52:52] <Mario204> it's some application form thing
[22:53:05] <Mario204> i asked by my friend to resolve issue to him
[22:53:18] <Mario204> do you allow to pm you with site details ?
[22:54:26] <Mario204> the form is working without any trouble in chrome/ff
[22:54:39] <Mario204> and in IE, submit button don't have any function
[22:54:49] <Mario204> i've tryed to use newest jquery version, but nothing happen
[22:58:13] <templaedhel> does the replace method allow for the use of regex subgroups in the replacement string?
[22:59:19] <nocturne7> I am not able to get the returned value from getSchedulerIdThatExistForCategoryAndDate here http://pastie.org/3546598 properly. when I debug it in firefox, it gets the correct schedulerid, but when I execute it in the app, due to speed difference I think, it enters the if statement
[23:06:46] <Whirl3dOrd3r> templaedhel, yes. It's not as robust as you'd like, but it does work.
[23:07:19] <templaedhel> Whirl3dOrd3r Right now I take the result(s) from .match() and run string replace with them as the searchstring

[23:25:05] <theBrettman> does a span have .txt()?
[23:25:18] <theBrettman> I'm getting object has no method txt
[23:26:56] <theBrettman> weird, I had to use html()
[23:27:55] <Whirl3dOrd3r> isn't it .text();
[23:30:52] <Time2303> if you use .text() it won't parse any html tags.
[23:31:10] <Whirl3dOrd3r> but .txt() won't return a thing
[23:35:45] <nocturne7> is it a bad practice to set   async to false ?
[23:37:57] <Whirl3dOrd3r> That's a ridiculous question. There are going to be times when it is good practice to set async to false. There are so many varialbes in a question like that it I am nearly certain I can say: "maybe" or "sometimes"
[23:39:07] <Whirl3dOrd3r> Is it bad practice to slam on your breaks when driving? Not if it keeps you from hitting someone/something....
[23:44:13] <Xotix> How can i get the width set by inline css?
[23:44:32] <Es0teric> Xotix -> .css()
[23:45:55] <Xotix> Es0teric: no, just the inline css. If there is not inline css, set by a style tag, i expect null to be returned.
[23:46:32] <Es0teric> xotix, then idk right now.. lol i kinda have a problem thats harder to solve
[23:47:07] <Whirl3dOrd3r> is it still called css if it's inline? I think it's inline styling and css is different.
[23:47:16] <Xotix> noone forced you to answer. But thanks.
[23:47:49] <Es0teric> >.>
[23:47:57] <Xotix> Whirl3dOrd3r:  css is always css.
[23:48:08] <Whirl3dOrd3r> cause if you wanted to check for specific style attribute being set inline, you might try: .attr("stylename");
[23:48:29] <Whirl3dOrd3r> why don't you ask #css
[23:48:29] <Hereisanotherlie> Whirl3dOrd3r: inline css is the same thing as accessing a css file
[23:48:32] <Xotix> Whirl3dOrd3r:  You mean width="x" i mean style="width: 20px;"
[23:49:06] <Xotix> Whirl3dOrd3r: Because getting inline css styles isn't a css thing. :P
[23:50:17] <aqeel> hi room
[23:50:26] <Whirl3dOrd3r> oh, of course it isn't. How foolish of me to think otherwise.
[23:50:33] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/mmD5c/
[23:51:11] <Xotix> Whirl3dOrd3r:  The question is about getting it. Not about styling it. :)
[23:51:29] <aqeel> is this right...can i get my id like that?
[23:54:47] <Whirl3dOrd3r> aqeel, people will say it's ugly, but technically it works. As long as the string value used as a selector is a valid selector value, you can do it. $("#"+somevairable+"-somestring") will work if "somevariable" resolves to a valid string
[23:56:04] <aqeel> thanks...
[23:57:16] <Es0teric> can someone help me achieve what i am trying to do with the jquery cycle plugin (paging option) without the jquery cycle plugin? http://jsfiddle.net/WQn7s/21/
[23:59:40] <Whirl3dOrd3r> so, you are looking to cycle through your project details using cycle, but want to set the initial state of project 1 to active before you start it, right?
