[00:55:34] <xboi209> hopefully someone is here :o
[00:56:15] <MattDunbar> ?
[00:56:19] <MattDunbar> lol
[00:56:29] <xboi209> kinda complicated question i got
[00:56:36] <xboi209> maybe im not thinking right
[00:56:41] <xboi209> D:
[00:56:55] <MattDunbar> I can take a quick look, no promises though Im signing off in the next 5-10
[00:56:56] <xboi209> how would i download code from a .js file and store it in localStorage
[00:57:16] <MattDunbar> Just curious, why?
[00:57:27] <xboi209> in case the js file goes down
[00:58:19] <MattDunbar> could store it as a string then eval it later, or even document.write it in a script tag.
[00:58:29] <xboi209> i know i can eval it later
[00:58:38] <xboi209> but how do i download the code in the first place
[00:58:42] <MattDunbar> Are you controling the javascript?
[00:58:45] <xboi209> yeah
[00:58:53] <MattDunbar> I don't know if there might be a better option, but:
[00:59:01] <MattDunbar> window.thisScript = ………
[00:59:10] <MattDunbar> then eval(window.thisScript); in the actual js file
[00:59:21] <MattDunbar> then you can just save window.thisScript to localstorage
[00:59:53] <xboi209> window.thisScript would contain the link to the js file?
[01:00:25] <MattDunbar> no, with it containing the actual code
[01:00:27] <MattDunbar> as a string
[01:00:31] <MattDunbar> I don't think its the best idea, 1 sec
[01:00:35] <MattDunbar> let me look into a few things
[01:00:48] <xboi209> uhm
[01:01:39] <xboi209> i wanted to put the code in localstorage
[01:01:45] <xboi209> and eval the localstorage
[01:01:53] <xboi209> but idk how to extract the code in the first place
[01:02:34] <sammich> almost the same way as you put it in
[01:02:36] <MattDunbar> check this out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13422899/how-to-read-a-js-file-as-plain-text-and-put-it-as-string-into-a-variable
[01:02:53] <MattDunbar> Do you not know how to get the code into local storage, or how to retrieve it
[01:03:11] <xboi209> how to retrieve it
[01:03:25] <sammich> well, maybe go $('script[src=url]').text();
[01:03:52] <xboi209> the things i never think....
[01:03:56] <MattDunbar> for (var key in localStorage) {   console.log(key) }
[01:04:03] <MattDunbar> figure out which key its in, then pull
[01:04:15] <MattDunbar> via localStorage.getItem(key)
[01:04:56] <xboi209> i meant how to retrieve the code
[01:05:02] <xboi209> but i think the link solves the problem
[01:05:05] <sammich> did that work xboi209?
[01:05:11] <MattDunbar> Then check out the other stackoverflow link and what sammich said
[01:05:27] <sammich> it's still a bit ambiguous what you're asking for
[01:05:38] <sammich> getting from local or getting from <script>
[01:05:46] <xboi209> <script>
[01:05:48] <MattDunbar> I think he wants to load the javascript as a string, and put it into local storage.  I might be wrong still.
[01:05:57] <sammich> yeah, so what I said
[01:06:02] <MattDunbar> yeah, I think
[01:06:03] <MattDunbar> lol
[01:06:42] <xboi209> ya load js as a string
[01:06:56] <MattDunbar> then try what sammich said.
[01:07:02] <xboi209> i get "TypeError: Cannot call method 'text' of null"
[01:07:20] <MattDunbar> fill in the actuall url part of the src=url
[01:07:25] <xboi209> i did
[01:07:36] <MattDunbar> then its not finding your script tag
[01:07:42] <xboi209> oh man
[01:07:44] <xboi209> hold up here
[01:07:46] <MattDunbar> you can try to select it other ways
[01:07:53] <MattDunbar> try #containerwithjs > script or similar
[01:08:08] <xboi209> i forgot i had the $ disabled
[01:08:10] <xboi209> lol
[01:08:15] <sammich> heh
[01:08:19] <xboi209> but now it doesnt output anything
[01:09:02] <MattDunbar> I'm off for the night, good luck.  I'm sure theres a way :)
[01:09:17] <MattDunbar> What you're trying to do would probably be better done with html5's offline storage methods
[01:09:53] <xboi209> localstorage sounds easier
[01:09:56] <xboi209> bye
[01:10:27] <sammich> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/148441/how-can-i-get-the-content-of-the-file-specified-as-the-src-of-a-script-tag
[01:10:36] <sammich> top comment and top reply of said comment
[01:11:38] <xboi209> would it be like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13422899/how-to-read-a-js-file-as-plain-text-and-put-it-as-string-into-a-variable#answer-13423425
[01:11:59] <sammich> yeah, use ajax
[01:12:15] <sammich> but really, I don't know why you don't just use the browser native caching
[01:12:32] <MattDunbar> html5 caching would be much better.
[01:12:40] <MattDunbar> you're loading it then calling it with ajax..
[01:12:54] <MattDunbar> so you're already loading 2x just to cache it
[01:13:04] <sammich> exactly
[01:13:19] <xboi209> wait wait
[01:14:10] <JBlitzen> What the hell?  Why is this alert not showing?
[01:14:11] <JBlitzen> http://jsfiddle.net/FYV3q/3/
[01:14:25] <sammich> it's alerting...
[01:14:40] <MattDunbar> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/appcache/beginner/ not sure about the quality of this resource, but its definitely easier.
[01:14:42] <JBlitzen> Not in IE?
[01:15:11] <MattDunbar> JBlitzen: your internets are broken
[01:15:18] <JBlitzen> That's some weird shit
[01:15:19] <sammich> it's just IE
[01:15:33] <sammich> that's perfectly kosher jQuery
[01:15:35] <JBlitzen> Runs jquery fine except on this fiddle.  Maybe it's the version or something
[01:15:48] <MattDunbar> might be jsfiddle conflicting with ie
[01:15:57] <sammich> ah, I've used appcache for making a webapp on iOS
[01:16:00] <JBlitzen> Weird
[01:16:02] <JBlitzen> Alright, thanks
[01:16:28] <sammich> updating the manifest is a royal pain in the butt though
[01:16:30] <MattDunbar> sammich: yeah, its pretty cool, and about as readily available as local storage if I remember right
[01:16:37] <MattDunbar> not really, its easier than writing custom JS.
[01:16:46] <xboi209> ya i might have to use html5's offline storage D:
[01:16:47] <JBlitzen> Okay, so the real reason I started a jsfiddle:
[01:16:48] <JBlitzen> http://jsfiddle.net/FYV3q/3/
[01:16:49] <MattDunbar> you just have to actually do it as you write files
[01:16:52] <xboi209> will have to use*
[01:16:53] <JBlitzen> Why is the second alert blank?
[01:16:57] <MattDunbar> not just randomly 'oh shit, have to update'
[01:17:00] <sammich> no, I mean you need to update the date modified for it to reload the new content
[01:17:01] <JBlitzen> Clearly there's a border-radius value
[01:17:10] <MattDunbar> oh
[01:17:12] <MattDunbar> )
[01:17:14] <MattDunbar> :)
[01:17:28] <sammich> I'm not sure if touch works, but I didn't think of using it at the time
[01:17:52] <MattDunbar> it would lol
[01:18:01] <MattDunbar> If you use a GUI editor that probably updates it for you too
[01:18:30] <sammich> maybe next time I make an offline-app
[01:18:42] <MattDunbar> I rarely if ever see the need for an offline app
[01:18:43] <sammich> I can just have a term open set to touch the file
[01:18:55] <MattDunbar> Chances are if it needs to be available offline it should be native
[01:19:14] <sammich> not offline per sé but using the manifest file to load all resources locally
[01:19:42] <sammich> yeah, but some tasks are just easier done in HTML/CSS/JS
[01:19:47] <MattDunbar> yeah, still if it needs that I need to shrink the size of the page
[01:19:56] <sammich> and I don't happen to own a licence for devving on iOS
[01:20:37] <MattDunbar> sammich: we deal with a lot of really big brands, so buying a license for a project isn't a big deal.  It does normally take longer to make a native app, but there are so many other advantages
[01:21:03] <sammich> yeah, I'm just some guy who wanted to learn jQuery in his spare time ;)
[01:21:09] <MattDunbar> :)
[01:21:30] <sammich> also, I have not the inclination or time to learn Obj-C
[01:21:45] <MattDunbar> Im a lead dev here who works 16 hours a day+ and is still up writing code at 4AM since yesterday morning on the weekend, so were in a bit different positions :)
[01:21:45] <sammich> it's on my bucket list though
[01:22:21] <sammich> well, I'm not expected to work those hours
[01:22:46] <sammich> but I do like to work on out of scope stuff in my spare time for work
[01:22:58] <MattDunbar> Im not necessairly expected to all of the time, but its a company I have equity in and really enjoy working for, and sometimes its necessary to make sure everything goes right.
[01:24:01] <MattDunbar> Unfortunately we run into a lot of not-so-great devs and I have to take over more than I was planning on once and a while.
[01:24:13] <sammich> big team?
[01:24:39] <MattDunbar> Not overly big.  Depends on whats going on at any given time
[01:25:07] <sammich> I wanna say that my dev colleagues aren't the hottest devs (lack of code sanitation really bugs me), so I keep tabs on them occasionally
[01:25:20] <sammich> but I'm the new guy, so I don't push their buttons
[01:25:34] <MattDunbar> lack of code sanitation as in.. sql vulnerable?
[01:25:44] <sammich> maybe not the right terminilogy
[01:26:13] <sammich> lets just say their code style and structure is a bit...inconsistent
[01:26:32] <MattDunbar> lol.  Do you do a fulltime job or freelance?
[01:26:44] <sammich> salaried, full-time
[01:27:06] <MattDunbar> ah, thats kindof a shitty position to be in
[01:27:18] <sammich> I'm being picky, I know. But I've spent no amount of my own time literally cleaning up their whitespace
[01:27:24] <sammich> no small amount*
[01:27:48] <MattDunbar> Luckily Im in the position where I can make the call of getting rid of devs.  I'm really picky though when it comes to being organized and making things work.
[01:28:06] <sammich> reading a file with heaps of anon-funcs with mixed tabs/spaces for indentation
[01:28:59] <JBlitzen> Figured out my problem above; asking for "border-width" css was wrong, since that's shorthand.  I asked for
[01:28:59] <JBlitzen> border-top-left-radius
[01:29:03] <JBlitzen> instead and that worked great
[01:29:04] <sammich> it's a really small company where I work, so at least I get to stand out from them
[01:29:19] <MattDunbar> A lot of the dev shops we compete with that offer services to similar sized brands often 'cheap out'.  THey'll make things work but they'll hack it together.  We take a lot of pride in being better in that aspect, but I can tell you sometimes it really does suck having to make everything work without enough support because certain devs just refuse to be organized.
[01:30:19] <tw2113> ah the measuring stick of professionalistm
[01:30:23] <MattDunbar> I've been working 16 hours+ for the past 3 months because we've had 3 devs fail on a 500+ hour project that I've almost done myself while keeping it on track.
[01:30:42] <sammich> you just can't teach people that stuff. It's like what I read one: barring a huge event in your life, after 25 years old, your personality is pretty much set
[01:30:43] <tw2113> where did that stray T come from?!?!?
[01:31:14] <MattDunbar> I'm only 21, so I guess I'm not set yet :)
[01:31:18] <JBlitzen> It's nice of them to pay you double your salary, Matt
[01:31:43] <MattDunbar> JBlitzen: I have equity (by choice), and I do get paid reasonably well.
[01:32:10] <sammich> well, I'm hoping I've stood out enough for my place for them to raise me a decent amount
[01:32:19] <sammich> 2 months away from salary review
[01:33:25] <sammich> I was promised a certain amount after probationary period. And they added a small chunk on top of that when I signed
[01:34:53] <MattDunbar> :) nice
[01:34:56] <sammich> at 21, it sounds like you're pretty set
[01:35:15] <MattDunbar> Yeah, I still own my first domain from when I was 12 :D
[01:35:52] <sammich> I guess I started programming pretty late, when I was 16
[01:35:53] <MattDunbar> I've been doing coding since I was pretty young though.  Started playing with ms frontpage then took it from there
[01:36:01] <MattDunbar> ha, thats still pretty good.
[01:36:02] <sammich> *shudders*
[01:36:49] <sammich> wasn't 'into it' at that point, but I knew it was something I'd be good at
[01:37:17] <MattDunbar> Yeah, I guess on the flip side I was intrigued by it and wanted to learn more about it constantly
[01:37:31] <sammich> what do you code in?
[01:37:33] <MattDunbar> I wanted to add a login to my site, ms frontpage couldn't do it, I learned php, and it went on from there :)
[01:37:47] <MattDunbar> PHP/Rails/Objective C/C++/C#/Java lol
[01:38:03] <sammich> what, no JS? :p
[01:38:11] <MattDunbar> didn't list frontend languages there :)
[01:38:18] <MattDunbar> I figured they'd be obvious with PHP/Rails on the list
[01:38:43] <sammich> still not sure what ROR is
[01:38:55] <sammich> I'll leave that for another day
[01:38:58] <doebi> is it possible to access my candy function within a listener in my init function? http://pastebin.com/y8dp1fG1
[01:39:09] <MattDunbar> Mostly PHP for web, Objective C is obvious for iPhone (I don't do a lot of it myself anymore, but I know enough to help another dev out when necessary).  C#/C++ I don't deal with much anymore but I've messed around with it on hardware devices.  Java I don't touch much anymore
[01:39:22] <MattDunbar> Rails is similar to PHP in some ways but it forces you into an MVC framework.
[01:39:58] <sammich> I've done only uni stuff in C/C++, did Java for first year of uni, Pascal/Basic when I was 16
[01:40:17] <MattDunbar> I guess I learned some basic / visual basic when I was younger too
[01:40:41] <MattDunbar> But before I was finished the highschool class teaching visual basic I realised how shitty it was and started building things in java instead, the teacher was cool with it.
[01:42:04] <MattDunbar> I did build a raycasting engine for my grade 12 final project for java, then went on to college (I dropped out after 1 semester) and got 4s across my programming classes and failed everything else because I didn't go to the classes, ever.
[01:42:36] <MattDunbar> that was fun
[01:43:02] <sammich> vectors. Not a fan of vectors
[01:43:23] <MattDunbar> vectors as in math, or vectors as in adobe illustrator?
[01:43:30] <sammich> math
[01:43:43] <MattDunbar> I did good with that in highschool, never really bothered much
[01:43:52] <MattDunbar> didn't show up for it in college
[01:43:55] <sammich> just guessing that raycating would involve some vector math
[01:44:01] <MattDunbar> yeah, quite a bit
[01:44:19] <MattDunbar> it was definitely beyond what you learn in highschool math, there was a lot more of a math learning curve than a programming one building that
[01:44:29] <sammich> I wasn't planning on doing programming for a job until I started failing engineering
[01:44:40] <MattDunbar> Were you doing hardware engineering before?
[01:44:49] <sammich> completely unrelated: aeronautical
[01:44:54] <MattDunbar> ah
[01:45:15] <MattDunbar> engineering is a bit broad, I try not to use the term because it confuses people whenw ere trying to find devs
[01:45:29] <MattDunbar> some devs call themselves software engineers, a lot of hardware people just call themselves 'engineers', etc
[01:45:31] <sammich> "I'm a developer"
[01:45:38] <sammich> What, property developer?
[01:45:50] <MattDunbar> even developer is a bit broad, but it at least points people to code when were talking in tech related areas
[01:45:55] <sammich> I'm a doctor.
[01:45:59] <MattDunbar> out of context, yeah, you need to be more specific
[01:46:00] <sammich> Just a PhD
[01:46:03] <MattDunbar> :)
[01:46:09] <sammich> not me
[01:46:13] <sammich> that was just an example
[01:46:21] <sammich> I'd die if I did a doctorate
[01:46:33] <MattDunbar> I cant imagine being in school that long
[01:46:47] <MattDunbar> maybe if I did programming and I got away with actually going to just tests/exams it'd work
[01:47:19] <MattDunbar> the program co-ordinator knew me so I got away with a lot of stuff, and the teachers knew I knew the co-ordinator (their boss) and let me get away with missing classes while still telling me when tests were and emailing me assignments
[01:47:33] <sammich> ah that's nice
[01:47:54] <motaka2> hello using this code http://jsfiddle.net/BfF6S/   i get all values of form inputs , but among several submits a form has I just need the value of the one which is clicked and not others, what should I do?  http://jsfiddle.net/BfF6S/
[01:47:59] <MattDunbar> thats the only reason I even passed that part
[01:48:05] <MattDunbar> I literally never went to my english class once
[01:48:05] <sammich> I wasn't super into uni, even the computing courses. I wasn't sure what path I wanted in life, so I just did the minimum
[01:48:26] <MattDunbar> I wasnt into it either, but I knew the content already so I just went and passed the tests
[01:48:26] <sammich> and in the middle of that was a really badly timed WoW phase
[01:48:31] <MattDunbar> lol
[01:48:34] <MattDunbar> haha
[01:48:50] <sammich> tell that to my 7 failed units
[01:49:03] <sammich> but anyway, I made it, after 6 years
[01:49:07] <MattDunbar> I had wow phases a few times, but I definitely only lasted maybe a week in them
[01:49:23] <MattDunbar> started playing it, then started getting bored
[01:49:25] <sammich> I was addicted to helping noobs in that game
[01:49:36] <MattDunbar> lolwtf
[01:50:08] <MattDunbar> so you were that guy who pushes the drug on the kids when they're on the line about using it :) ?
[01:50:36] <sammich> I'm the guy who like helping those who need it just so he gets satisfaction from helping out those people who are easy to help
[01:50:41] <motaka2> hello using this code http://jsfiddle.net/BfF6S/ i get all values of form inputs , but among several submits a form has I just need the value of the one which is clicked and not others, what should I do?
[01:51:28] <MattDunbar> motaka2: please try to re-explain that, I don't follow.
[01:52:45] <sammich> anyway, I'll be off now.
[01:53:14] <MattDunbar> sammich: check your PMs quickly :)
[01:53:16] <MattDunbar> ttyl
[01:54:11] <motaka2> MattDunbar: Look I have a form which has more than one submits, each time I click one of those submites I need all input values of that form but among those submits I just need the value of the submit which was clicked, but using the code I shoed you I get all submits values
[01:55:02] <doebi> is it possible to access my candy function within a listener in my init function? http://pastebin.com/y8dp1fG1
[01:58:25] <motaka2> hello using this code http://jsfiddle.net/BfF6S/ i get all values of form inputs , but among several submits a form has I just need the value of the one which is clicked and not others, what should I do?
[02:07:22] <motaka2> Why no one helps me?
[02:16:30] <motaka2> Cork: Are you there?
[02:21:18] <motaka2> doebi: Are you there?
[02:36:09] <the|SonGoku> hi all
[02:39:50] <aftab> Hello i have 10 div element with class name images and with up and down buttons which I want to use to move that particular div element up or down, please let me know how to do that ?
[02:41:34] <the|SonGoku> I would do it this way...set a onclick function which saves this as $that...so $that = this;...now you call a function with parameter $this and tell it to change the position of your div
[02:41:58] <aftab> yes I understand that but how do you change the position ?
[02:42:02] <aftab> please
[02:42:50] <the|SonGoku> every element is manipulateable with css, right?
[02:42:59] <aftab> yes
[02:43:08] <the|SonGoku> so you just tell the css to change the position to +50px or -50px or so
[02:43:27] <aftab> oh not the pixel position
[02:43:52] <the|SonGoku> what instead?
[02:44:29] <aftab> lets say i have <div class="images">first div<button>up</button><button>down</button></div> <div class="images">second div<button>up</button><button>down</button></div> <div class="images">third div<button>up</button><button>down</button></div>
[02:44:39] <aftab> now when I click on up button from second div
[02:44:44] <aftab> i want it to move above first div
[02:45:18] <aftab> the code should change like this <div class="images">second div<button>up</button><button>down</button></div> <div class="images">first div<button>up</button><button>down</button></div> <div class="images">third div<button>up</button><button>down</button></div>
[02:45:18] <the|SonGoku> ahhh I get your point
[02:45:25] <aftab> its like sorting them
[02:46:29] <the|SonGoku> let me think about it for a second
[02:46:52] <aftab> sure please take your time
[02:47:31] <the|SonGoku> you could display:none all of them and save the order in an array
[02:48:12] <aftab> then ?
[02:48:44] <aftab> found it actually
[02:48:53] <aftab> insertBefore and insertAfter works
[02:48:56] <the|SonGoku> so you would simply display none all of them, then change the order in the array and give your div's classes like first, second, third and so on
[02:49:09] <the|SonGoku> ahhh nice, learned something additional :)
[02:49:49] <aftab> thats nice thank you
[02:51:41] <aftab> this is what i used

[02:56:27] <the|SonGoku> oO wow I realy dont get it :D
[03:51:58] <spobat> can I access "lastElement" in this loop?
[03:51:59] <spobat> http://ideone.com/iLBikk
[03:52:28] <spobat> I modify all elements in of that selector + I need to do something with the last entry
[03:54:11] <spobat> why isn't that working this way?
[03:57:28] <spobat> it works if I remove the setTimeout around it, but I need than
[03:57:29] <spobat> that *
[03:57:29] <joker_89> hi
[03:58:27] <spobat> hi
[04:00:55] <spobat> so, any idea about that?
[04:00:55] <spobat> http://ideone.com/EgqIDd
[04:02:17] <sammich> what is that supposed to do?
[04:03:19] <spobat> assign the last element to lastElement
[04:04:28] <sammich> well yeah, you have a setTimeout
[04:04:32] <sammich> it's async now
[04:04:49] <spobat> that's the issue, right!
[04:04:59] <spobat> thank you
[04:05:18] <sammich> no worries
[04:05:49] <spobat> is it possible to easily check within the .each for an index being the last?
[04:06:15] <sammich> do you mean, is the .each at the last iterator?
[04:06:24] <spobat> if I can avoid another $(".parentSelector > *").length; it would be cool, yeah
[04:07:10] <sammich> http://api.jquery.com/each/ first arg is the index
[04:07:22] <spobat> yeah, i know ;)
[04:07:33] <sammich> so, before you call the .each, store the length of the selector
[04:07:36] <spobat> but i still don't know how many indexes are there
[04:07:57] <spobat> ok, i was asking if there is a way to avoid that but apparently not ok
[04:08:45] <sammich> well, it'll just be var theList = $(selector);
[04:09:05] <sammich> theList.each(function() { if (theList.length === idx) {} });
[04:09:45] <sammich> + function(idx) {
[04:22:43] <spobat> right
[04:24:21] <spobat> well length -1 === idx
[04:28:31] <sammich> yup
[04:45:29] <entrika> hi
[04:45:56] <entrika> hello
[05:28:55] <jeremy-> Are there any good plugins that use something like serialize to automatically grab all form inputs and generate a PDF
[05:29:25] <jeremy-> I can think of some ways to do it manually but it would be cool if there was a way to retain PDF print functionality even if an end user modifies the form
[05:34:41] <tuv> is there a canonical (or best-known) debounce plugin? seems to be there are a few. not sure which to use
[05:36:39] <jeremy--> srry, disconnect
[05:37:02] <JanSch> hi, I'm looking for an externs file for the closure compiler to use with jquery 2.0.2. Does anyone know of such a file?
[06:01:38] <Alina-malina> http://pastebin.com/Nv1UvE8c  can someone please explain to me what is this??
[06:06:23] <sammich> debug log of a minified source
[06:37:34] <Bauer1> how can I select elements that have something like: name="chk_group"
[06:37:53] <Bauer1> I googled a lot, and all suggestions are too complicated, I didnt like any of them
[06:38:02] <Bauer1> they all suggested to use javascript
[06:38:51] <dabear> Bauer1: $("*[name='chk_group']")
[06:39:00] <dabear> will be slow, though
[06:39:04] <Bauer1> why slow?
[06:39:09] <gry> i have a variable that holds a string '<foo>', how do i escape the <>s in it, what jquery function do i use?
[06:39:18] <dabear> because it iterates over all elements in the page
[06:40:45] <Bauer1> ahh, dabear thats no prob I will limit this to only input tags and where type=checkbox, but a small correction: the actual elements I need to catch are like: <input type="checkbox" name="Platform[]" id="VMCheckbox" value="VM" />VM<br /> and doing $("*[name='Platform[]']") returns null
[06:42:56] <Bauer1> The idea is to select all input elements of a certain group, by name attribute, dabear
[06:43:40] <gry> hrm
[06:47:17] <Martijn-NL> Hi jQuery fans - i want to add text next to an input field with id 'input-time'. Does anyone know how i can do this?
[06:48:20] <sammich> gry: you might have to use the HTML entity encoded version of < and >
[06:48:46] <gry> quite honestly i read the input (from json api) and it already has &lt; properly there
[06:49:01] <sammich> Bauer1: it's probably failing because you're using [] inside your name attr
[06:49:05] <gry> how do i do html encode?
[06:49:15] <Bauer1> sammich: I tried without as well, same results null
[06:49:43] <sammich> attribute selectors have a few tricks, you might want the ^= which searches for the begining
[06:49:56] <sammich> so $('input[name^=platform]')
[06:50:22] <Bauer1> also null, sammich
[06:50:22] <sammich> gry: what are you trying to do?
[06:50:37] <sammich> capital P then
[06:51:25] <sammich> case sensitive, you see
[06:51:36] <shoky> Bauer1:  $('[name="Platform[]"]')  works fine
[06:51:58] <sammich> I guess that's why you use the quotes around that
[06:52:16] <sammich> something I tend not to do, messes with my zen
[06:52:17] <Bauer1> you sure shoky? weird.. I STUILL get null.. ok then its  an unrelated problem on my end then
[06:52:23] <gry> sammich: i get json content from an api and then .append to an element in dom tree
[06:52:51] <sammich> okay, I think your encoding is wrong
[06:52:54] <Bauer1> thanks, I will solve the general problem first
[06:53:06] <sammich> if it's coming through as &lt; then that's text
[06:53:09] <gry> sammich: api sais &lt;foo, i see "<foo" on the resulting html page, "<foo>" gets hidden as browser thinks it's a tag
[06:53:17] <gry> says, even
[06:53:26] <sammich> ah right
[06:53:28] <shoky> Bauer1 yes i'm sure
[06:53:35] <gry> possibly text, yes
[06:53:51] <gry> how do i handle that?
[06:54:01] <sammich> so you're getting HTML from the page? or just a string, and you're appending it?
[06:54:11] <gry> just a string
[06:54:12] <sammich> because append uses .html
[06:54:14] <shoky> Bauer1:  $(...) shouldn't return null anyway, for anything.. i think
[06:54:31] <sammich> you might need to use .text()
[06:54:54] <sammich> you will probably have to build an element and insert text into it
[06:55:00] <sammich> then append that element
[06:55:53] <gry> http://jsfiddle.net/gryllida/Rewqw/1/
[06:56:44] <gry> ok, i'll try
[06:56:50] <shoky> gry: don't use onclick
[06:56:53] <shoky> attributes
[06:57:01] <shoky> gry: http://jsfiddle.net/Rewqw/2/
[06:57:42] <sammich> wow, I thought that was a checkbox
[06:57:46] <sammich> weird
[07:01:47] <gry> sammich: does it being onclick or not make difference enough for it to give different output? i fail to follow
[07:02:15] <gry> (i don't use onclick in the larger thing i write, but i don't see how it'd make a difference in this case)
[07:02:37] <shoky> gry: it makes a difference because the onclick attribute is already html
[07:03:01] <shoky> so when you put &lt; there it's already decoded before it even runs
[07:03:17] <shoky> just like when you put &lt;  anywhere else in the html
[07:04:44] <gry> ok
[07:15:22] <Dodde> can anyone point me to some information regarding using jquerymobile to build a hybrid application that can perform file operations like downloading a file from the internet and save it locally on the device with no user interaction?
[07:19:21] <khaan> hi everybody. Is there anyone that can teach me how to make a div appear when it hits the half of the screen with waypoints?
[07:27:18] <gry> what is a "waypoint"?
[07:28:00] <sammich> #anchor?
[07:37:17] <motaka2> hello change isnt trigerred on this code, http://jsfiddle.net/aV92L/
[07:45:43] <motaka2> hello change isnt trigerred on this code, http://jsfiddle.net/aV92L/
[07:54:32] <motaka2> no one there?
[07:56:31] <mydog2> hey shoky.. !
[07:56:49] <mydog2> shoky,  - your points were helpful dude...
[07:57:47] <motaka2> mydog2: Are you there?
[07:58:03] <grafi> motaka2 why should the div trigger a change event? oô
[07:58:33] <motaka2> grafi: why a div ?
[07:58:43] <grafi> var $wholeArea = $("div#content");
[07:59:17] <motaka2> grafi: read documentation for on()
[07:59:32] <mydog2> motaka2, - what's up?
[08:00:11] <grafi> yeah that was dumb xP just woke up
[08:01:24] <motaka2> grafi: my english is not good
[08:01:38] <motaka2> mydog2: hello change isnt trigerred on this code, http://jsfiddle.net/aV92L/
[08:02:34] <mydog2> motaka2,  - no idea.. i'm not a jquery guy...
[08:02:47] <motaka2> ok
[08:03:19] <mydog2> have you verified that all the "syntax" is correct...
[08:03:34] <grafi> have you checked your console for javascript errors?
[08:08:21] <aFeijo> Hey folks, I'm after a carousel plugin that works with 3x3 images, not 1 row but 3. Do you know which one is compatible?
[08:14:01] <shoky> mydog2: glad i could help
[08:14:48] <motaka2> how can I remove the first ul li ul from an unordered list
[08:16:35] <mydog2> shoky.. not so fast my friend!!
[08:16:46] <mydog2> i might have another "simple question"!!!
[08:17:01] <dabear> daddy loves it simple
[08:17:02] <dabear> yeah
[08:17:36] <motaka2> how can I remove the first ul li ul from an unordered list
[08:18:43] <dabear> motaka2: $("ul>li>ul").first().remove()
[08:20:16] <shoky> mydog2: welp you know what to do ;p
[08:21:49] <mydog2> shoky -- this works... $(aa).attr('data-reward',reward);
[08:21:51] <motaka2> dabear: it keeps the first one and inner ones are deleted
[08:22:06] <mydog2> at least the debug keeps going
[08:22:26] <mydog2> however, how can i set the innerText/html ???
[08:22:53] <mydog2> neither this -- 				$(aa).attr('data-reward').html(reward);  or this 				$(aa).attr('data-reward').text(reward); works
[08:23:13] <mydog2> i get an err that text/html is not a function
[08:25:20] <shoky> mydog2:  you want to set the text/html , or the attribute?
[08:25:26] <mydog2> shoky  -- http://jsfiddle.net/L6sGF/   -- the name=urow function is where i'm checking, trying to set the text
[08:25:29] <shoky> mydog2: you're confusing 2 things
[08:26:02] <shoky> mydog2: .attr('data-reward')  just returns a string - the attribute itself. you can't call jquery methods on it
[08:26:14] <shoky> an attribute is not an element
[08:26:31] <mydog2> shoky.. doh!!
[08:26:46] <mydog2> so it shoul just be.. the $9aa).html()="foo"
[08:26:53] <shoky> no
[08:27:01] <shoky> first you need to decide what you want
[08:27:13] <shoky> (to change)
[08:27:30] <shoky> if you want to change aa's inner html, then it's with .html() method, go read the docs on how to use it
[08:27:35] <shoky> ?html @ mydog2
[08:27:40] <shoky> `api html
[08:27:40] <b-ot> shoky: .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[08:29:09] <BlackmanOMG> is THIS NIGGA CHAT?
[08:29:23] <mydog2> shoky.. my bad.. thanks.. just another person to talk to.. need sleep!! thanks
[08:31:41] <mydog2> shoky,  - i wasn't paying attention to the fact that the attr().. wasn't an obj...
[08:31:51] <mydog2> and that i needed the obj..
[08:31:58] <mydog2> simple thing...
[08:34:21] <roelof> Could anyone help me figure out why the flip is not working on this page : http://test.tamarawobben.nl
[08:37:26] <iaj> hmmm is there a way to select an a tag by its title?
[08:37:46] <shoky> roelof: you haven't included jquery
[08:39:06] <shoky> iaj: yes
[08:40:56] <iaj> hmmmm
[08:41:39] <shoky> iaj: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[08:43:58] <roelof> shoky : done that but still not working :(
[08:44:27] <iaj> shoky:  ahh thanks so I could do a $('.class[title="Login"]')
[08:44:55] <shoky> iaj yep
[08:45:23] <shoky> roelof:  you didn't do it.. http://test.tamarawobben.nl/jquery.1.4.2.min.js
[08:45:42] <iaj> awesome its working:)
[08:46:08] <shoky> roelof: learn to look at your console.  Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined     <-- means you probably didn't include jquery correctly
[08:46:17] <roelof> corrected it
[08:47:13] <roelof> shoky : I now see this error : Uncaught ReferenceError: TT is not defined
[08:47:27] <shoky> roelof: that's something you should look into, but it's not relevant to the images
[08:47:38] <shoky> roelof: you don't have any <img> with data-src  attribute
[08:47:59] <Cyclohexane> why won't this work? $(document).ready(function(){ alert("hi"); });
[08:48:04] <shoky> ?ftj @ roelof
[08:48:19] <shoky> `demo @ Cyclohexane
[08:48:19] <b-ot> Cyclohexane: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:48:37] <roelof> shoky : I do not understand what yu mean with data-scr arrribute ???
[08:49:09] <shoky> roelof:  what don't you understand?  your script is looking for images that have a data-src  attribute. but none of your images have it. so it doesn't do anything
[08:49:50] <roelof> oke, then I have to look at the orginal (20thingsIlearned) what I have to change
[08:50:13] <shoky> or try to fix it yourself..
[08:55:46] <roelof> shoky : you mean like this : <img src="/css/images/back-cover.jpg" data-src-flipped="/css/images/back-cover-flipped.jpg" width="830" height="520">
[08:56:01] <shoky> roelof:  hm?
[08:58:19] <jedimind> he said
[08:58:22] <jedimind> YOU MEAN LIKE THIS ...
[09:00:08] <shoky> then what
[09:00:14] <shoky> er i mean
[09:00:17] <shoky> .. and then?!
[09:07:34] <roelof> Im thinking of giving up. I changed eveything but still no luck
[09:11:13] <roelof> or looking for a easier script which can do the same. The google example is too difficult for me :(
[09:14:57] <roelof> anyone who knows a easy flip script which can do the same as 20things ?
[09:16:34] <roelof> and which can also work with buttons instead of only the corners of a book
[09:56:15] <Alina-malina> how i can work with google minified javascript code? is there any way to make it human readible, at least i need to find a function that is generating a specific func?
[09:56:47] <Eviltwin> Alina-malina: You can throw it into jsbeautifier
[09:56:55] <Eviltwin> Which will at least make it prettily intented
[09:57:04] <Eviltwin> But everything will still have the short names etc
[09:57:23] <Eviltwin> I've been able to trace minified code before after putting it through jsbeautifier
[09:59:03] <Alina-malina> jsbeautifier? is it some kind of an addon?
[09:59:42] <Alina-malina> thanks i will try it
[10:00:44] <Alina-malina> Does BurpeSuite can show javascript steps? or it just only can see POST and GET?
[10:09:27] <Eviltwin> Alina-malina: Because it's not attached to the browser, I don't think it can show steps
[10:09:56] <Alina-malina> oh ok, i just start figuring out, i didnt know about this lovely tool, thanks alot! i will play with it and let you know how it helped me!
[10:09:59] <Eviltwin> Alina-malina: However Firebug (addon to Firefox) or the Web Inspector (built in to Chrome) can show you
[10:10:15] <Alina-malina> no i cant find with chrome or firebu
[10:10:27] <Alina-malina> it just freezes and it is hard to figure out somehing there
[10:10:41] <Eviltwin> Sounds like probably an infinite loop somewhere
[10:11:02] <Alina-malina> i dont know, the code is very huge
[10:11:27] <Eviltwin> You could look into using the v8 profiler: http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/V8Profiler
[10:11:36] <Eviltwin> It tells you where your program is spending its tile
[10:11:37] <Eviltwin> time*
[10:12:13] <Alina-malina> ok, i will try it thanks alot!
[10:12:48] <bongjovi> Is it possible to have a mouseenter/leave event show/hide a div that is NOT a child (as an overlay), without the overlay div triggering the mouseleave event when it is scrolled over?
[10:13:23] <Eviltwin> bongjovi: Check this out: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events
[10:14:00] <Eviltwin> bongjovi: You can see at the bottom that support is only for modern browsers
[10:14:17] <Eviltwin> But it lets you pretend like an element isn't on the page for mouse purposes
[10:14:26] <bongjovi> Ah, yeah and only for SVGs?
[10:14:35] <bongjovi> hmm
[10:14:43] <Eviltwin> Uh, no, it's also for SVGs
[10:15:11] <bongjovi> oh sorry, i mean it doesn't support HTML content on any versions of IE/Opera?
[10:15:30] <Eviltwin> I believe IE9 supports it and Opera 9
[10:16:43] <Eviltwin> This thread may be helpful: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1009753/pass-mouse-events-through-absolutely-positioned-element
[10:17:28] <bongjovi> Thanks
[10:18:14] <e-anima> hi. anyone has som ip for a plugin that saves formvalues through a page
[10:18:48] <bongjovi> Seems like I should really try harder to make the overlay a child...
[10:37:27] <e-anima> anyone ever used:http://sisyphus-js.herokuapp.com/
[10:37:54] <e-anima> bad doku where is a full example. i added $( "#fuck" ).sisyphus(); inside my $(document).ready(function(){ ...
[10:37:57] <e-anima> it just does not work
[10:38:05] <e-anima> not saving anything in my form
[10:40:59] <Elsie> Anything in the JS console?
[10:44:45] <e-anima> no
[10:44:55] <e-anima> i mean there are examples
[10:44:56] <e-anima> http://sisyphus-js.herokuapp.com/
[10:45:05] <e-anima> but where the hell is the code for the examples
[10:45:17] <e-anima> unly some ugly minified code in the htl, useless
[10:49:13] <Elsie> Minification is harmful to the nature of the open Web.
[10:49:30] <e-anima> ist just a shit example. pretty page but shit example
[10:51:45] <shoky> e-anima: seems to work fine http://jsfiddle.net/DXyWf/
[10:52:05] <e-anima> not here
[10:52:08] <e-anima> i use crome
[10:52:13] <shoky> me too
[10:52:17] <e-anima> latest version, hit enter...empty form
[10:52:20] <e-anima> hm
[10:52:43] <e-anima> well your example wouldnt work, ther eis no sisyphus included there
[10:52:46] <shoky> hit enter? you're supposed to reload it or something
[10:52:55] <shoky> sisyphus is included, and it works fine
[10:53:06] <shoky> if you reload after changing the text, the text will be restored
[10:53:08] <e-anima> ops
[10:53:18] <e-anima> if yu hit submit everything is gone
[10:53:24] <e-anima> ok, i misunderstood thep lugin
[10:53:29] <e-anima> plugin
[10:53:36] <shoky> seems like it
[10:53:36] <e-anima> mjy bad
[10:54:04] <e-anima> thats what i wa slooking for. storing the values for the page "like settings of a search bar"
[10:54:15] <e-anima> thx shoky for enlighting me
[11:22:21] <Eviltwin> For the time being it seems that every jQuery problem in the world has been solved.
[11:23:13] <grafi> Quick everybody, think of more problems!
[11:25:02] <bongjovi> Ohhh, I don't want to ask anything now...
[11:31:28] <nastus> anyone know why this isnt taking the data from the form? http://jsfiddle.net/JGPUU/1/
[11:46:28] <iamcurio> can someone point me into the right direction oh how to do something like this: http://weareyours.com/ - how it has a image display first and fade out before viewing the site?
[11:47:02] <nastus> anyone know why this isnt taking the data from the form? http://jsfiddle.net/JGPUU/1/
[11:54:03] <shoky> nastus: first of all, check your console for errors
[11:54:40] <nastus> well it was telling me the form was null with the length part, however I couldnt figure out why - which is why I am here
[11:55:24] <shoky> nastus:  first error is .length() instead of .length
[11:55:49] <shoky> nastus: 2nd, you didnt initialize localStorage with the contacts.. so getContacts()  returns null
[11:55:58] <shoky> and you can't do  null.length ..
[11:57:17] <shoky> nastus: 3rd, you're not putting anything in the array..   contacts.push();   doesnt' do anything
[11:57:33] <shoky> nastus: time to go through your code and make sure you're doing things logically
[11:57:53] <grafi> and somewehre there is an contacts.length()
[11:58:04] <shoky> ya that was 1st thing i said
[11:58:11] <grafi> xD
[11:58:15] <shoky> there's .length() a few times there
[11:58:16] <grafi> oops
[11:59:17] <shoky> there are a few more errors there ...
[11:59:38] <shoky> var message;  message += '...';
[11:59:43] <shoky> will make message be 'undefined...'
[12:32:17] <RonWhoCares> I am in the midst of setting up a jQuery AJAX.  I thought putting an "e" in brackets would prevent the form from submitting when someone clicks the <button> which triggers the jQuery --- $("#preview_my_link").click(function(e) {  --- What have I do wrong?
[12:32:56] <shoky> RonWhoCares: putting an e there just means that you're gonna name the first argument "e"
[12:33:01] <shoky> it doesn't "do" anything
[12:33:15] <shoky> RonWhoCares: you probably wanna do e.preventDefault()
[12:33:47] <RonWhoCares> is that what I should have in the function bracket
[12:33:57] <shoky> no
[12:34:20] <shoky> the function parens just have the names of the arguments. no actual code..
[12:35:34] <Eviltwin> RonWhoCares: Do you know JavaScript?
[12:41:54] <joker_89> hi

[13:11:37] <Jar567473453434> I'm new to JQuery
[13:28:57] <e-anima> i am looking for a plugin that can save checkbox/selection/textfield states through a page
[13:29:11] <e-anima> in my ase its a searchbar
[14:10:01] <bongjovi> I'm trying to build a really simple accordian.. Would it make sense to just build it with regular jQuery rather than using UI if I won't be using UI for anything else?
[14:22:05] <Eviltwin> You can make a custom build of jQuery UI that only has the core components + accordion
[14:22:11] <Eviltwin> bongjovi: ^
[14:22:21] <Eviltwin> If you don't want a super feature rich one it's easy to build without
[14:23:35] <Cache_Money> Why am I getting "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :" when my url returns this JSON? http://pastie.org/8073107
[14:24:05] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ Cache_Money

[14:24:09] <Eviltwin> Show us the code causing the error
[14:24:12] <Eviltwin> Not just the error
[14:26:14] <Cache_Money> Eviltwin: it's a local Sinatra app that's returning the JSON in the link above.  I'm trying to access the json within a script tag to populate the data points for a highcharts.js chart
[14:28:37] <Eviltwin> bongjovi: http://jsfiddle.net/rxQrv/
[14:28:58] <Eviltwin> Cache_Money: Wait, so you're doing like <script src=".../mydata.json"></script>?
[14:31:53] <Cache_Money> Eviltwin: No, I'm trying to access the url from a separate js file http://pastie.org/8073131
[14:34:12] <Cache_Money> Eviltwin: I created a locultunnel to my local machine.  Here's the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/zQ8hZ/1/
[14:34:40] <Cache_Money> Basically, I want to access the json api and use the data to populate the chart.  Right now it has static values
[14:34:41] <Eviltwin> Am I supposed to be seeing an error here?
[14:35:07] <Eviltwin> You know the difference between JSON and JSONP, right?
[14:35:13] <Cache_Money> Eviltwin: no, but I am seeing it on my chrome browser
[14:36:25] <Cache_Money> Eviltwin: kinda.  The script wouldn't let me access the url if I used JSON
[14:38:45] <Cache_Money> Eviltwin: Basically, I'm having trouble accessing the JSON returned from http://55ee.localtunnel.com/daily/pageviews.json and using it to set the values for the highchart (series.data)
[14:39:03] <Eviltwin> First of all
[14:39:09] <Eviltwin> async: false is deprecated and a bad idea
[14:39:17] <Eviltwin> And it cannot work with JSONP
[14:39:26] <Eviltwin> So grow up and use a callback
[14:39:29] <Eviltwin> ?ajax101 @ Cache_Money
[14:39:29] <b-ot> Cache_Money: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpg and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[14:39:29] <bot-t> Cache_Money, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[14:39:34] <Cache_Money> okay... FYI i'm pretty new to jQuery
[14:40:48] <Eviltwin> Cache_Money: http://jsfiddle.net/zQ8hZ/2/
[14:44:22] <Cache_Money> Eviltwin: that works when the URL is the Yahoo Finance url but when I change it to my localhost URL it doesn't work.
[14:44:35] <Cache_Money> thanks for your help by the way
[14:44:44] <Eviltwin> The localhost URL is broken, I think
[14:44:54] <Eviltwin> And you want it to work for the remote anyway, right
[14:44:59] <Eviltwin> The real Yahoo Finance URL
[14:45:12] <Cache_Money> no, i was just copying an example that was using the Yahoo URL
[14:45:24] <Eviltwin> So what's your real goal?
[14:45:37] <Cache_Money> here's the URL to my local machine http://3ju9.localtunnel.com
[14:46:03] <Cache_Money> The end goal is to access my JSON API and populate the data returned into a chart
[14:46:33] <Cache_Money> Eviltwin: sorry the url is http://3ju9.localtunnel.com/daily/pageviews.json
[14:47:13] <Eviltwin> Okay, will this page actually be on the same domain as this data source?
[14:47:26] <Cache_Money> most likely
[14:47:46] <Eviltwin> If you can guarantee that it is, you can use regular JSON and everything will be fine
[14:48:02] <Eviltwin> If you can't then you need to use JSONP which requires a function call around the JSON
[14:48:19] <Eviltwin> Rather than {...} you'd have myCallbackFunctionName({...})
[14:48:25] <Eviltwin> It it'd get loaded as a <script> tag
[14:48:44] <Eviltwin> Because scripts can be loaded across domains, you can get the data
[14:48:56] <Eviltwin> And the function call means your code can get triggered
[14:49:35] <Cache_Money> so what would I need to change http://jsfiddle.net/zQ8hZ/2/
[14:54:13] <Eviltwin> Cache_Money: http://jsfiddle.net/z8XNs/
[14:55:52] <Cache_Money> Eviltwin: thanks!
[15:08:41] <e-anima> found something: https://github.com/sebringj/jquery.dumbformstate
[15:53:22] <otherj> what kind of obfuscation is this? \u0024(\u0064\u006f\u0063\u0075\u006d\u0065\u006e\u0074).\u0072\u0065\u0061\u0064\u0079(function()
[15:54:20] <tw2113> looks like a lot of unicode
[15:55:19] <otherj> yeah
[15:56:06] <tw2113> looks like it converts to $(document).ready
[15:56:16] <otherj> what did you use to convert?
[15:56:17] <tw2113> http://rishida.net/tools/conversion/
[15:56:54] <tw2113> paste into the mixed input and click convert
[15:57:35] <otherj> yeah
[15:57:41] <otherj> but "\056\144\167\163\145\145\055\143\157\156\164\145\156\164\055\154\151\156\153" isn't unicode, right?
[15:58:07] <tw2113> doesn't look like it for that part
[15:58:14] <otherj> so weird
[15:59:22] <tw2113> .dwsee-content-link
[15:59:26] <tw2113> http://ddecode.com/hexdecoder/
[15:59:59] <otherj> this is definitely an interesting method. not sure i'll bother to go through the trouble to obfuscate in this way though ;o)
[16:00:04] <otherj> thanks for the insights tw2113
[16:00:40] <tw2113> i'm just googling
[16:10:26] <wilornel> Hey guys, the before() function is supposed to return the newly created content?
[16:12:03] <tw2113> http://api.jquery.com/before/
[16:13:11] <otherj> hm. apparently this is obfuscated by putting query functions into unicode and selectors into hex
[16:13:22] <otherj> now i just need to find an efficient way to 'decrypt' it
[16:13:26] * otherj googles
[16:26:14] <bjorn_> hey i have a quick question
[16:26:17] <bjorn_> so i have a div
[16:26:22] <bjorn_> called month_holder
[16:26:30] <bjorn_> and in it i have links with the class month
[16:26:37] <bjorn_> and then uls with blog_months
[16:26:40] <bjorn_> so when you click a month
[16:26:49] <bjorn_> i just want that months ul to show
[16:26:50] <bjorn_> $('#month_holder .month').click(function() {     $(this).closest('.blog_months').show(); });
[16:26:53] <bjorn_> like that
[16:27:15] <bjorn_> any advice
[16:28:11] <bjorn_> ??
[16:29:45] <bjorn_> anyone online
[16:43:08] <bjorn_> hey anyone online?
[16:43:48] <Eviltwin> Just ask your question
[16:44:04] <MattDunbar> He already has, then hes asked if people are online / any advice / etc 4x now.

[16:44:46] <bjorn_> kk will do 1 sec
[16:44:51] <Eviltwin> Link that and explain what's not working how you expect it to
[16:44:55] <Eviltwin> Or what you don't know how to solve
[16:44:59] <Eviltwin> That's how to get the best help
[16:53:20] <fredd_> Im trying to change a value from a json object.. in this example i want to display some names instead the numbers im getting from the json.. what should i change here http://jsfiddle.net/SREcf/24/
[16:55:00] <Eviltwin> fredd_: Well your switch statement is running once, not once for each value
[16:55:26] <fredd_> Eviltwin:  thought there was something there
[16:55:54] <fredd_> Eviltwin:  should i move the switch statement inside the each?
[17:00:04] <Eviltwin> fredd_: Here's how you want to go about it: http://jsfiddle.net/ByMhH/
[17:01:25] <fredd_> Eviltwin:  cool.. thankkss =)
[17:27:49] <HarryPitfall> what is the best method to get a child element of another element using jQuery: $('child-selector', $parentQuery) or $parentQuery.find('child-selector') ?
[17:30:18] <bobbyhay> jQuery Mobile Q: can you have a collapsible set that is inset?
[17:30:50] <bobbyhay> I've got the demo sample, then I changed data-inset to 'true' and then it broke out into individual sets
[17:37:39] <bobbyhay>  okay, so I want information inside the header rows of the collapsibles. I can see you can do it with listviews
[17:38:26] <bobbyhay> maybe I should use a listview, and have a single collapsible inside each LI
[17:38:43] <Eviltwin> HarryPitfall: $('selector', x) runs $(x).find('selector')
[17:38:50] <Eviltwin> HarryPitfall: So use $parentQuery.find('child-selector')
[17:45:41] <HarryPitfall> Yes, I've read this... .find is better since is one level less of call stack...
[18:14:59] <bobbyhay> can you have jQuery index a certain attribute like it does for ids?
[18:15:19] <bobbyhay> because, unless I'm mistaken, jQuery Mobile uses id for it's own purposes
[18:16:12] <bobbyhay> for certain elements
[18:16:13] <arschmitz> bobbyhay: the only special thing jquery mobile does with ids is if its the id of a page you can link to it in a link with its id
[18:16:50] <arschmitz> bobbyhay: other then that there is nothing special at all with ids in JQM
[18:17:37] <bobbyhay> ah, maybe I just made a bad assumption then
[18:18:09] <bobbyhay> yeah, terrible assumption
[18:18:13] <bobbyhay> oops
[18:27:28] <blindMoe> anyone have a trick to mimic :hover when someone taps on an tablet or phone?
[18:28:28] <tw2113> wouldn't that be touch events?
[18:28:45] <Eviltwin> How do you define hover on mobile?
[18:28:59] <tw2113> trick question Eviltwin
[18:55:43] <ahmeni> Are jQuery queues suitable for things other than animations? I've got a page with a couple functions that pull information through $.get() and I'd like to fire them off sequentially rather than all at once.
[19:02:16] <rhizome> hi all. i have a couple of terminology questions about image galleries: what's the difference between "slider" and "carousel"? and what is the thumbnail selector bar called that tends to go below the image being displayed?
[19:02:48] <rhizome> these things appear to be used somewhat interchangeably, but i'm not sure
[19:05:44] <Jellyg00se> I'm able to return an ajax request and populate my html through it, but I need to have an array of the items so that I can then use autocomplete
[19:06:06] <Jellyg00se> any help would be appreciated, it's a literally GET request to a PHP page that returns a database structure
[19:06:13] <Jellyg00se> I just need to format it correctly
[19:06:40] <rhizome> what format is the structure?
[19:07:37] <Jellyg00se> rhizome: well I'm currently getting back a return of an html page and the  printing that but
[19:07:45] <Jellyg00se> the format of the database query would be an assoc
[19:07:48] <Jellyg00se> assoc array
[19:08:04] <Jellyg00se> I think i need 2 x ajax queries in this case to make it simple/easy
[19:08:16] <bobbyhay> just console.log out the result and you can find your way from there
[19:08:27] <eip56> Does .blur() support select dropdowns?
[19:08:27] <rhizome> well, commonly you'd retrieve json and spit things out from there
[19:08:43] <Jellyg00se> this isn't my code I just know what I need from it...
[19:08:56] <Jellyg00se> at the mo I have 1 x php page that outputs html to the GET ajax request
[19:09:17] <Jellyg00se> but i also need a variable for an array so to keep it simple, I would like to be able to send that back to a second ajax request
[19:09:32] <Jellyg00se> not the best practice but it will work, however I'm unsure how to get it to format
[19:09:33] <bobbyhay> Jellyg00se: you'll want to get just data. JSON. Then you can actually format it anywayhow you want it
[19:09:47] <bobbyhay> if you get an associative array, traverse it using this idiom http://stackoverflow.com/questions/684672/loop-through-javascript-object
[19:09:48] <rhizome> i'm guessing it's someone else's page
[19:10:19] <Jellyg00se> rhizome: yeah that and I've never really worked with JSON or how it works along with the fact I didn't make it :(
[19:10:32] <Jellyg00se> sorry to be a bind, but bobbyhay I'll check that out for the mo thanks
[19:10:37] <rhizome> well, if it's someone else's page you're going to have to use what you can get
[19:10:43] <rhizome> s/page/site/
[19:11:03] <rhizome> google jquery page scraping
[19:11:09] <Jellyg00se> the way I see it is, don't worry about their ajax request, make my own PHP page that talks to the database and then output to json and work from there
[19:11:15] <Jellyg00se> just forget about their crap basically
[19:11:40] <bobbyhay> that's probably the best way, in most situations
[19:11:43] <rhizome> maybe explain your setup a little better. your site, but someone else's php?
[19:11:55] <rhizome> i.e. co- or ex-coworker?
[19:12:12] <rhizome> or just a random site, like airline or real estate?
[19:12:18] <Jellyg00se> this is the whole situation, i just need to be able to create an array within javascript/jquery, so that I can apply autocomplete to it... I need to know how I can return a PHP array into a javascript array
[19:12:22] <Jellyg00se> and then I can work out the rest
[19:12:31] <Jellyg00se> no just some random client that needs it done :(
[19:13:12] <Jellyg00se> rhizome: sorry it's native
[19:13:16] <Jellyg00se> I have full access
[19:13:18] <Jellyg00se> and it's local
[19:13:32] <bobbyhay> are you using the jQuery UI autocomplete?
[19:13:42] <Jellyg00se> the actual issue isn't the code it's me not knowing enough about how to convert the information
[19:13:45] <Jellyg00se> and yes that's it
[19:13:53] <Jellyg00se> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[19:13:56] <Jellyg00se> that's what I'm aiming for
[19:13:58] <rhizome> erm, well just write your own PHP that gets the data how you want it!
[19:13:59] <Jellyg00se> hence the huge array
[19:14:21] <Jellyg00se> it needs to be javascript dynamic, otherwise I'd shove it into a SELECT and tell them to bugger off :)
[19:14:42] <bobbyhay> then you'll have to build a retreival page to return a list of name:value pairs
[19:14:43] <rhizome> use keyup() after three characters or so to send the string and retrieve the array of possibilities
[19:15:19] <Jellyg00se> so if I write a boolean search within MySQL, and each time keyup is pressed or sent then send another ajax request and return?
[19:15:53] <bobbyhay> Jellyg00se: you're using the widget for jUI
[19:15:57] <rhizome> depends on your goal, but that's one option.
[19:16:15] <bobbyhay> just let it do all the work. THe bahviours are all built in. The data retreival is handled by the widget, you jsut have to build the data source
[19:16:16] <Jellyg00se> well I get that but the UI seems to be already what I need
[19:16:37] <Jellyg00se> hence the... PHP -> mysql -> return -> jquery array -> jquery UI handles it
[19:16:53] <Jellyg00se> that's what I think should happen? I dunno does that sound right?
[19:17:00] <rhizome> generally, yeah
[19:17:02] <bobbyhay> return a simple js array with objects {label:item_label, value:item_value'}
[19:17:33] <bobbyhay> jUI AC also send a param called 'q' as the filter
[19:17:47] <Jellyg00se> sorry bob, you've lost me, please excuse my ignorance
[19:17:51] <bobbyhay> so stick that in your WHERE LIKE
[19:18:06] <Jellyg00se> I just don't know how to communicate with JSON/jquery from PHP that's my real issue
[19:18:11] <bobbyhay> that sounds like an insult :D
[19:18:19] <tw2113> json_encode/json_decode
[19:18:32] <rhizome> the PHP just receives the request, makes the MySQL query based on it, and returns the JSON or whatever
[19:18:53] <bobbyhay> it's all there http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[19:19:02] <bobbyhay> that's all
[19:19:21] <Jellyg00se> I'll write a function  that returns an array, a list in alphabetical order in this format array("something", "soemthingelse") within PHP
[19:19:32] <Jellyg00se> then that comes back into jquery under "data: something"?
[19:19:38] <Jellyg00se> and I must handle it from there/
[19:19:43] <Jellyg00se> using ajax
[19:19:47] <rhizome> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11091988/return-json-response-from-a-mysql-query
[19:19:54] <rhizome> that looks like PHP
[19:20:11] <Jellyg00se> wicked, I've already taken up enough of all of your time
[19:20:17] <rhizome> no biggie
[19:20:18] <Jellyg00se> thank you very much for your help :) I'll read on!
[19:20:25] <bobbyhay> good luck
[19:20:30] <Jellyg00se> thank you
[19:20:42] <rhizome> peolpe have been doing this for years, there's plenty of info out there :)
[19:21:21] <Jellyg00se> I know, but it's best to be able to understand it through other peoples experience I think
[19:21:33] <Jellyg00se> it's not like I can't google things, it just makes more sense this way
[19:22:47] <Jellyg00se> last question, in php you can var_dump($variable)
[19:22:52] <Jellyg00se> is there an equiv in java?
[19:23:03] <Jellyg00se> so I can see the data that I'm trying to handle?
[19:23:43] <rhizome> no clue
[19:23:58] <Eviltwin> Jellyg00se: In Java not JavaScript
[19:24:34] <Jellyg00se> Thank you EvilTownCat
[19:24:36] <Jellyg00se> bah
[19:24:40] <Jellyg00se> Eviltwin*
[19:25:16] <Eviltwin> In JavaScript you want to look at console.log
[19:25:38] <Jellyg00se> Eviltwin is there a command to print to the console where I can inspect element on the browser/
[19:25:46] <Jellyg00se> console.log("something")?
[19:26:00] <Eviltwin> console.log("my string") or console.log(myObject) or console.log(myElement)
[19:26:01] <Eviltwin> They all work
[19:26:14] <Jellyg00se> wicked, I should really be googling this stuff but i appreciate it.
[19:26:17] <Eviltwin> In Chrome it works by default. In Firefox you need to install Firebug
[19:26:34] <Eviltwin> It's an interactive output too. Not just a wall of text like var_dump
[19:26:49] <Jellyg00se> you can manipulate and rerun?
[19:27:27] <Eviltwin> ...just try it
[19:28:07] <Eviltwin> Jellyg00se: http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[19:30:13] <Jellyg00se> thank you
[20:10:57] <RRR2> ohboy
[20:13:24] <Jellyg00se> I know this is backwards but I need a hand with knowing how to work it forward and not backwards
[20:13:25] <Jellyg00se> http://pastebin.com/5V8nkZEQ
[20:13:47] <Jellyg00se> instead of sending the information, i want to retrieve either raw information or information between a dom tag, doesn't matter either way
[20:14:11] <Jellyg00se> town_city.php is a database request that returns an array, and i'm a bit stuck :)
[20:14:42] <Jellyg00se> well at the moment it loops round and returns <div id=#town_cities> kinda thing but I know it's wrong i just don't know how to correct it,
[20:15:07] <tw2113> are you json encoding what you return from the town_city.php file?
[20:19:14] <Jellyg00se> the PHP file is a raw return, should I apply the encoding to the function before the request, after or both?
[20:21:14] <tw2113> if you're requesting json data, you'd need to encode the array to json before returning it to the browser via ajax
[20:21:28] <tw2113> on the php side
[20:21:45] <Jellyg00se> ok so I should use a PHP function to do so and then return it
[20:21:47] <Jellyg00se> in this format?
[20:21:54] <tw2113> json_encode
[20:21:58] <tw2113> there's your function
[20:22:05] <Jellyg00se> (someweirdjavakey: "data") etc..?
[20:22:11] <Jellyg00se> is that the format it exists in?
[20:22:21] <Jellyg00se> thanks
[20:23:52] <Jellyg00se> tw2113: sorry to be a pain but do I need to define the dom of where the data will be between/
[20:23:56] <Jellyg00se> or can i just return the value/
[20:24:24] <Jellyg00se> i.e. do I have to specify <div id="callme">something here</div>
[20:24:24] <tw2113> on the php side?
[20:24:30] <Jellyg00se> or can I just return "something here"?
[20:24:31] <Jellyg00se> yeah
[20:24:51] <Jellyg00se> because I'm specifying it within my jquery to <look> for an ID called "callme"
[20:24:54] <tw2113> returne json_encode( $myarr );
[20:25:02] <Jellyg00se> sound thank you
[20:25:11] <tw2113> what you do on the browser side with the data is up to you
[20:25:58] <Jellyg00se> I just thought it needed an anchor of some sorts but I'll give it a shot :)
[20:26:32] <tw2113> php side just handles the data, not the dom manipulation
[20:28:34] <Jellyg00se> I think it'll be apparent if I paste my code it's only a small snippet and i'm sure you could shout at me day long about where i've gone wrong if you don't mind
[20:28:50] <tw2113> i'm sure someone will :P
[20:31:09] <Jellyg00se> http://pastebin.com/5V8nkZEQ
[20:31:14] <Jellyg00se> hehe
[20:31:18] <Jellyg00se> it's a small snippet
[20:31:53] <Jellyg00se> there's obviously an input <input type="text" id="searchTerm" name="searchTerm" value=""/> beforehand within a form
[20:31:56] <tw2113> so, you have the jQuery ajax half
[20:32:20] <tw2113> the return json_encode( $somevar ) data would be stored in the obj js var in your success callback
[20:32:54] <Jellyg00se> sure, I get that it won't be in the "correct" format, but I thought I could debug through the console
[20:33:22] <tw2113> what won't be in the correct format?
[20:33:27] <tw2113> obj should be json data
[20:33:42] <tw2113> or at least a serialized version from js side
[20:33:59] <tw2113> maybe, that may actually be the part that's sent to the server
[20:34:19] <Cache_Money> How would I apply the gray theme (http://www.highcharts.com/demo/line-time-series/gray) to this chart? http://jsfiddle.net/t3xxV/1/
[20:34:24] <Cache_Money> first time using highcharts.js
[20:34:34] <Jellyg00se> ok so really where I'm going wrong is that I'm expecting an array but i have an object, so if I loop through the object creating an array from it
[20:34:45] <Jellyg00se> then it might be in the format that the function expects?
[20:35:31] <tw2113> looking over this snippet of code
[20:35:38] <tw2113> you grab whatever is in the #cityinfo div
[20:35:39] <Jellyg00se> tw2113: this is what i'm aiming for if it helps
[20:35:41] <tw2113> serialize it
[20:35:45] <tw2113> and send it to the server
[20:35:52] <tw2113> on the server, you do something with it
[20:36:12] <tw2113> apparently you're trying to create an array that you return to the browser
[20:36:14] <Jellyg00se> so I should put back the div id="cityinfo" within my php script called by ajax
[20:36:23] <Jellyg00se> yeah that's right
[20:36:49] <tw2113> i believe the ajax is expecting json in return
[20:36:52] <Jellyg00se> wait wait wait I'm wrong
[20:36:56] <tw2113> so you need to use php to encode the json
[20:36:58] <Jellyg00se> I'm not wanting to send any information to the script
[20:37:00] <tw2113> from an array
[20:37:07] <Jellyg00se> the script only returns information by itself, I'm not sending it anything
[20:37:14] <Jellyg00se> which is why I know my data is incorrect etc..
[20:37:22] <Jellyg00se> however, even if that's the case it should still have a return?
[20:37:24] <tw2113> ah good point, i see the GET
[20:37:40] <Jellyg00se> the script queries the db, gets all the towns/cities
[20:37:48] <Jellyg00se> and then I need an array to be able to run the UI against it
[20:38:29] <tw2113> if you're sending queries to the server to manipulate what it returns
[20:38:51] <tw2113> then i think you'd maybe need POST
[20:39:06] <Jellyg00se> sorry tw2113 I'm not
[20:39:16] <Jellyg00se> I just want the output from the script, I don't need to ask it any information
[20:39:21] <Jellyg00se> send it* any information
[20:39:26] <tw2113> php script, right?
[20:39:29] <Jellyg00se> it just returns, and then i need to manipulate it
[20:39:30] <Jellyg00se> yes
[20:39:30] <tw2113> script has many meanings
[20:39:45] <tw2113> so the ajax has zero effect on the outcome
[20:39:50] <tw2113> ot srue the data param is needed then
[20:39:53] <tw2113> not* sure*
[20:39:59] <Jellyg00se> so, jquery ajax -> calls PHP (doesn't need any values) -> returns -> converts to array
[20:40:11] <Jellyg00se> exactly
[20:40:13] <Jellyg00se> you're spot on
[20:40:23] <tw2113> so you're making an http request
[20:40:27] <tw2113> expecting JSON in return
[20:40:38] <tw2113> and you have your success callback passing in obj
[20:40:47] <tw2113> and then you do whatever with it in the browser
[20:40:50] <Jellyg00se> yeah, although I don't know enough about it to just return an array
[20:40:54] <tw2113> you need to make your php script return json
[20:41:15] <tw2113> so have the php side construct your array however it must
[20:41:16] <Jellyg00se> didn't this do the job though: return json_encode($output);?
[20:41:23] <Jellyg00se> ok
[20:41:24] <tw2113> then do return json_encode( $myarray );
[20:41:32] <Jellyg00se> yeah it's doing that at the moment
[20:41:41] <Jellyg00se> $output = array("values", "etc..")
[20:41:43] <tw2113> that json data will be what's in the obj js var in your success callback
[20:41:55] <Jellyg00se> so I just need to reference the obj properly through a loop
[20:42:04] <tw2113> so now in your success callback, you need to do whatever to it
[20:42:09] <tw2113> appending to whatever dom elements, etc
[20:42:31] <tw2113> the console.log will display what's in it, if anything
[20:42:44] <Jellyg00se> well I was quite surprised that the console doesn't show anything and/or the alert didn't either
[20:42:52] <Jellyg00se> leaves me to think i've got incorrect syntax in my jquery
[20:43:07] <tw2113> something in between isn't working
[20:43:13] <Jellyg00se> but I'm on the right track?
[20:43:18] <Jellyg00se> if that's the case I'll keep at it
[20:43:24] <Jellyg00se> rather than taking up any more of your time :)
[20:43:50] <tw2113> it's a support channel
[20:43:52] <tw2113> you come here for support
[20:44:01] <tw2113> if i wanted people to "not waste my time" i'd either leave or not reply
[20:44:05] <Jellyg00se> hehe
[20:44:10] <Jellyg00se> well I do appreciate it so thank you
[20:45:10] <bobbyhay> <3 this channel
[20:46:55] <Jellyg00se> tw2113: do you think it could be that I'm sending across an undefined data amount?
[20:47:01] <Jellyg00se> should i set that to null?
[20:47:12] <Jellyg00se> I do not NEED to send data
[20:47:14] <Jellyg00se> just to receive
[20:47:22] <tw2113> try it and see
[20:50:20] <Jellyg00se> I think i have a scope issue possibly,
[20:50:35] <Jellyg00se> the variable doesn't go outside of the scope of the function
[21:04:02] <lenswipee> does linux file name allow spaces like windows? e.g 'foo bar.php'
[21:04:34] <gry> yes
[21:04:43] <cknox> lenswipee, yes, but IIRC you need to escape the space, and its likely best not to...
[21:05:15] <lenswipee> okay
[21:05:31] <tw2113> just use underscores
[21:05:35] <tw2113> save yourself headache
[21:06:00] <rhizome> if i have a collection of selectors with an identical data attribute with different values, how can i find the one with a particular value?
[21:06:04] <lenswipee> whats the convention? underscores or -
[21:06:55] <tw2113> i imagine both are fine
[21:07:15] <tw2113> if i'm wrong with both being fine, use underscores
[21:07:35] <tw2113> rhizome, how are you going over the collection? $.each ?
[21:08:27] <rhizome> tw2113: i know the value i'm looking for, so i was figuring i could just pluck that out (somehow).
[21:09:04] <tw2113> i imagine you could get it selectively with an if statement
[21:09:16] <rhizome> tw2113: my initial attempt:
[21:09:24] <rhizome> er... sel.data(slideIndex(idx)).addClass('active')
[21:09:29] <tw2113> if $('whatever').data('foo') == 'desired value')
[21:09:54] <tw2113> with proper matching ()'s
[21:10:37] <tw2113> maybe
[21:10:40] <tw2113> i'd have to tinker
[21:11:12] <grafi> tinker tinker little star
[21:11:13] <tw2113> maybe store the collection of all into a variable, then loop over those and compare the desired value to the current value
[21:11:17] <tw2113> if true, act
[21:16:27] <shoky> sel.filter('[data-xyz=value]').addClass('active')
[21:16:42] <grafi> that works?
[21:16:44] <grafi> crazy
[21:17:22] <shoky> well he said it's a data attribute
[21:17:40] * rhizome tries
[21:17:47] <grafi> i just never realised you could feed anything other than a function into filter
[21:17:54] <shoky> o
[21:17:56] <shoky> sure
[21:17:57] <grafi> :P
[21:18:22] <rhizome> can value be interpolated within those single quotes?
[21:19:01] <shoky> js doesn't do interpolation.. but.. '[data-xyz=' + someval + ']'  works, usually
[21:19:10] <rhizome> cool
[21:19:13] * rhizome tries some more
[21:19:30] <shoky> could put quotes around the value to be a bit safer
[21:35:16] <rhizome> hm, no error, but not working: sel.not('.bx-clone').filter('[data-slide-index="'+idx+'"]').addClass('active')
[21:35:50] <rhizome> i can add the class to the object in firebug, but it won't be added that way. do I need a [0] to target that element of the object?
[21:38:02] <shoky> nope
[21:38:57] <rhizome> yeah, it just snatches the item itself without any jq
[21:39:48] <shoky> pretty much
[21:40:13] <rhizome> could it be the lack of function in .filter?
[21:40:33] <shoky> .filter doesnt need a function
[21:40:44] <shoky> cant say what it is without seeing a demo
[21:40:45] <rhizome> just in an execution sense
[21:41:03] <rhizome> yeah, let me twiddle and see if i can put an example together
[21:41:07] <shoky> donno what you mean by that, but no, no problem with not passing a function
[21:43:22] <rhizome> hah, hide() works
[21:45:03] <rhizome> would it matter that the element has a blank class already? <a href="" class data-foo="bar">...</a> ?
[21:45:09] <rhizome> nil class i guess
[21:49:14] <shoky> don't think so
[21:51:04] <rhizome> .text("foo") works, too
[21:51:07] <rhizome> gr
[21:51:20] <shoky> are you removing the class somewhere maybe
[21:51:32] <shoky> inadvertently
[21:52:48] <Jellyg00se> tw2113: just to recap from earlier the reason that it wasn't working was purely because i was "returning" within PHP and not echoing out
[21:53:01] <Jellyg00se> didn't realise that would be the case, how stupid i feel heh
[21:55:01] <rhizome> shoky: i removed an earlier removeClass, but it didn't change anything. i can target a child of sel and it will add the class. spose it's possible the bare class thing is futzing it up
[21:58:48] <shoky> rhizome: it shouldn't futz up anything
[22:00:31] <rhizome> well, this works: sel.not('.bx-clone').filter('[data-slide-index="'+idx+'"]').find('img').addClass("active")
[22:00:43] <rhizome> doesn't work without the find, targeting the wrapping a
[22:01:05] <shoky> fiddle is long due
[22:03:10] <grafi> fiddle di du
[22:03:41] <cknox> how do I convert my jQuery from using $('#tasks li').live('click', function(evt) { to using .on() or .delegate()?
[22:04:00] <cknox> Im trying to figure it out from the docs, but I cant seem to get it to work...
[22:04:42] <shoky> $(selector).live(events, data, handler);   -->   $(document).on(events, selector, data, handler);
[22:05:05] <shoky> you got no data so omit the data
[22:05:25] <shoky> and it's best to use a closer ancestor than "document"
[22:08:39] <cknox> so its basically because I got it backwords...
[22:09:07] <cknox> although im confused...
[22:09:16] <cknox> the document says that delector and data are optional...
[22:09:33] <shoky> when using .on in general, yeah, thy are
[22:09:39] <cknox> shouldnt I have been able to do: $('#tasks li').on('click', function(evt) {
[22:09:50] <shoky> not with the same effect as .live
[22:09:56] <shoky> (the effect being event delegation)
[22:10:06] <shoky> .on only does delegation if you specify the selector
[22:10:41] <cknox> so $('#tasks').live('click', li, function(evt) { it is then
[22:10:52] <shoky> .on, you mean
[22:10:56] <cknox> err yeah
[22:11:12] <shoky> yeah. if #tasks is a static element
[22:35:36] <bobbyhay> arschmitz: I've got a control group here that doesn't seem to like not having an enumerated id tag
[22:51:38] <Bauer1> Why when I do: $('[name="Platform[]"]').each( function (i, el) { el.is(':checked') } ); I get TypeError: Object #<HTMLInputElement> has no method 'is'
[23:19:21] <progzer> Excuse me, the jQuery.mobile.loadPage doc mentions the second parameter should be an Object (with various properties). Though the first example given just passes true as the second parameter...
[23:20:28] <jfugett> mongo
[23:23:18] <progzer> What is an AMD module?
[23:27:09] <lenswipee> AMD is CPU
[23:28:01] <bobbyhay> progzer: http://dojotoolkit.org/features/1.6/async-modules
[23:28:18] <jfugett> and AMD module is a type of javascript module specification the most commonly used loader for AMD modules is require.js
[23:28:36] <Bauer1> Why is this code not working? it doesnt save elements into window.Platforms array :( console.log shows clearly singular elements like [VM: true]
[23:28:37] <Bauer1> var Platforms = [];
[23:28:37] <Bauer1>     $('[name="Platform[]"]').each( function (i, el) { var Platforms = []; Platforms[el.value] =  el.checked; console.log(Platforms); window.Platforms[el.value] = el.checked; } );
[23:28:58] <Bauer1> when I check the external Platforms, it is empty array
[23:30:15] <bobbyhay> I was wondering where I saw Platforms[] before ;)
[23:30:31] <jfugett> Bauer1: you're redefining platform in each iteration so the platform is never attached to the global variable you defined
[23:30:38] <Bauer1> I was asking about the selector yesterday, bobbyhay :)
[23:31:17] <bobbyhay> I know. I helped you. This is my nick when I'm at work :)
[23:31:41] <Bauer1> jfugett: yes well, I cant avoid that using a .foreach, but I am assigning one platform assoc array on each iteration to the global Platforms array, and there is nothing left...
[23:35:55] <jfugett> Bauer1: Since you're assigning to a global variable you should just be able to use window.Platforms[el.value] = el.checked; and do away with the variable definitions inside of the foreach then console log window.Platforms after the assignment to see the changes
[23:37:15] <Bauer1> jfugett, I just tried again.. the variable remains empty :( sec I will do a jsfiddle, maybe that would help
[23:41:33] <Bauer1> jfugett: I think I found the problem: inside the .each, window.Platforms: undefined
[23:41:43] <Bauer1> why is that?
[23:42:33] <Bauer1> maybe it is related to the fact that the line (and preceeding var Platforms = [];) are withing a separate function scope? if so how do I access it?
[23:43:57] <tanky> Hi people! I was just wondering if anyone here knows knockout. My task is to make a click binding on an element inside a div. The event should hide the div. This is easy enough to bind to the element inside the div, but a parent element in the DOM is not as straight forward. I guess I have to include the div that I want to hide in the viewModel, but I really don't care about it's data.
[23:44:51] <jfugett> Bauer1: To be honest I usually avoid attaching things to window by creating a single global app variable I'm guessing it has to do with the scope you can try defining a global Platforms variable outside of the foreach with no var declaration to see if that fixes the issue
[23:46:06] <jfugett> something like Platforms = []; $('[name="Platform[]"]').each( function (i, el) {Platforms[el.value] = el.checked});console.log(Platforms);
[23:50:36] <Bauer1> jfugett: but that is exactly what I have done: http://jsfiddle.net/jeZNr/ first problem is "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'VM' of undefined " on line 36 of the Javascript
[23:50:49] <Bauer1> there is no trace of the Platform global variable at all, in the console
[23:51:29] <jfugett> Bauer1: Taking a look now
[23:54:17] <jfugett> Bauer1: There you go, take a look at the fiddle now
[23:55:06] <Bauer1> uhm, a link please jfugett? :)
[23:56:07] <bobbyhay> argh, spaghetti code
[23:56:21] <jfugett> stupid middle click http://jsfiddle.net/wUqFT/
[23:58:27] <jfugett> bobbyhay: lol breathe man breathe
[23:58:27] <Bauer1> huh, jfugett why is your revision working? I did the same thing exactly! window.Platforms[el.value] = el.checked; which is also the same as commented out
[23:59:03] <OrenBochman1> I get a strange behaviour with an acordion - it leaves a big gap between the first and ond other divs when closed
[23:59:19] <Bauer1> ohhh I see you took the variable outside the function... ok, any better idea how to do it right? it feels wrong, as bobbyhay said - spaghetti code :P
