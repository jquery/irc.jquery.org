[00:00:27] <abjorn> you could try $(elem).context === $(elem).context
[00:00:35] <MoTiOnXml> thanks :)
[00:00:42] <abjorn> np
[00:00:51] <abjorn> context is the DOM node referenced by the jQuery object
[00:01:19] <abjorn> or nodelist or whatever dom object it is
[00:05:01] <coldhead> woah dead can dance have reformed
[00:05:20] <MoTiOnXml> abjorn: it
[00:05:30] <abjorn> it
[00:05:33] <MoTiOnXml> sorry :)
[00:05:43] <abjorn> lol
[00:05:44] <MoTiOnXml> abjorn: it's not what I need actually; it always points to the original jQuery object
[00:05:57] <abjorn> it does? o.o
[00:05:58] <MoTiOnXml> abjorn: i'm first selecting a ribbon div, then selecting from that, filtering etc.
[00:06:22] <MoTiOnXml> abjorn: i get it, it's the source of the selector, but i would like the current associated html element
[00:06:46] <MoTiOnXml> like uid in mootools
[00:06:59] <abjorn> hmm...I feel like it *should* give you the dom element
[00:07:03] <abjorn> but I guess that's not always the case
[00:07:53] <MoTiOnXml> if I do
[00:07:59] <abjorn> ohh
[00:07:59] <MoTiOnXml> _self.tabSetGroups = this.element.find(".tab-set-container > li");
[00:07:59] <MoTiOnXml> _self.tabSet = _self.tabSetGroups.find(".selected");
[00:07:59] <MoTiOnXml> _self.group = _self.tabSet.next(".tab-set-group");
[00:08:10] <abjorn> ?get @ MoTiOnXml
[00:08:10] <bot-t> MoTiOnXml, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[00:08:11] <MoTiOnXml> all .context properties point to the this.element
[00:08:16] <abjorn> there you go
[00:08:17] <abjorn> .get()
[00:08:19] <MoTiOnXml> ah thanks
[00:08:28] <MoTiOnXml> above is just mock-code btw
[00:08:33] <abjorn> yeah
[00:15:07] <MoTiOnXml> abjorn: when comparing objects like that i'll have to do .get(0) in many places - isn't there a nicer way to do it?
[00:15:34] <abjorn> Not really. Most of the time you'll get a node list
[00:15:34] <MoTiOnXml> abjorn: ie. saving the previous object, the comparing with the event.target object coming in the handler ..
[00:15:44] <MoTiOnXml> yea, i guess it's the nature of jQuery
[00:15:52] <abjorn> No, it's the nature of the DOM
[00:16:22] <abjorn> When you're querying for objects, unless it's a case where there can only be one (get an element by it's ID) it's going to be a list of nodes.
[00:16:43] <MoTiOnXml> the other way around then
[00:17:22] <MoTiOnXml> well, what i ment was that i guess this is one of the nice parts of jQuery; it's mostly agnostic to the number of elements
[00:17:40] <abjorn> mhm
[00:17:47] <abjorn> I guess in one sense, anyways
[00:17:55] <MoTiOnXml> regardless, thanks :)
[00:18:02] <abjorn> np
[00:25:12] <sorens3n> anyone home
[00:26:00] <lonejack> Hi, does somebody know if there is a simple manner to open a popup window using only css?
[00:26:08] <coldhead> ever loved a woman / who made you feel tall / ever loved a man / who maaaaaaaaade you feel smalll
[00:26:42] <coldhead> god no, lonejack
[00:26:46] <coldhead> that could never ever work
[00:26:53] <coldhead> i will fight anyone who says otherwise
[00:27:25] <lonejack> fancybox
[00:28:02] <coldhead> style =/= behaviour
[00:28:41] <abjorn> ^
[00:28:49] <abjorn> it will always require javascript
[00:29:08] <coldhead> I NEED MY CONSCIENCE TO KEEP WATCH OVER ME / TO PROTECT ME FROM MYSELF
[00:31:24] <sorens3n> lonejack: yes
[00:31:38] <sorens3n> but it involves javascript of course
[00:31:56] <sorens3n> the simplest way to do it, imo, is to just add/remove a class of the modal/popup
[00:32:05] <sorens3n> or even just, show/hide
[00:32:12] <sorens3n> and predefine it with css
[00:32:20] <lonejack> sorens3n,  I developed a code that open a popup window in js(select an image). After my selection on child window I do a write on parent window with 'window.opener.Function()'. The browser doesn't allow this because it consider this a xss attack. How can I solve this ?
[00:32:23] <sorens3n> which is more or less what most popup libs do
[00:32:45] <sorens3n> just add a class to the popup div
[00:32:53] <sorens3n> $.show()
[00:33:01] <sorens3n> $.toggle() i think works too?
[00:33:18] <sorens3n> and predefine what it should be with CSS, only do a display: none;
[00:33:38] <sorens3n> why target the window?
[00:37:22] <lonejack> sorens3n, so, if I understand well what you say is: don't open a new window. Just put your contents in a div and proceed with a show when it needs?
[00:37:32] <coldhead> what's everyone's favourite features of IE8?
[00:37:56] <sorens3n> yes
[00:37:59] <sorens3n> thats what i do
[00:38:03] <sorens3n> http://sorensen.no.de
[00:38:12] <sorens3n> the top menu's are all 'popup's
[00:38:23] <sorens3n> which are already defined on the page, the clicking action only toggles a class
[00:38:33] <sorens3n> and then add's the overlay
[00:38:39] <sorens3n> which really isn't nessesary
[00:38:47] <sorens3n> its just a preference or whatever business logic you happen to have
[00:39:32] <lonejack> sorens3n, ok, but  In my 'new' window I've to put 'galleria'(http://galleria.aino.se/). Do you think it is possible?
[00:40:50] <lonejack> sorens3n, before to continue let me declare myself as a beginner...
[00:41:32] <sorens3n> no worries
[00:41:54] <sorens3n> http://galleria.aino.se
[00:42:23] <sorens3n> no reason it shouldn't work
[00:42:39] <sorens3n> there will be a memory overhead if you make galleria and just hide the div
[00:42:55] <sorens3n> alternatively you could call galleria the same time you make the div visable
[00:43:00] <sorens3n> in the chance that they dont click it
[00:43:16] <sorens3n> shoulnd't make much diff
[00:43:35] <sorens3n> its like... galleria's container, if you just 'display: none;'
[00:43:46] <sorens3n> and then 'display: block;' onClick
[00:43:53] <sorens3n> pretty simple
[00:44:04] <sorens3n> technically, though the concept is not
[00:44:11] <sorens3n> not trying to belittle you in any way
[00:44:32] <lonejack> sorens3n, thank you for your explanation. I'll try today...
[00:47:13] <sorens3n> hope it helps
[00:47:18] <sorens3n> first time in this channel lol
[00:47:23] <sorens3n> i'm a node.js developer
[00:47:36] <sorens3n> somedays jquery isn't my strong suit
[00:47:51] <sorens3n> and node.js taught me more about JS than jquery did
[00:47:57] <sorens3n> as just an FYI
[00:48:31] <alloc> hello
[00:48:39] <alloc> is possible do some table in jquerymobile?
[00:48:45] <lonejack> sorens3n, have you a good we..
[00:49:05] <alloc> something like split-list do, but more columns
[00:54:16] <sorens3n> we..?
[00:54:30] <sorens3n> u lost me
[00:55:11] <coldhead> i think he means weed
[00:58:09] <sorens3n> lol

[02:02:48] <non-troll-nick> $("div(.likes, .alt)").each(function(){   this doesnt select anything
[02:02:50] <non-troll-nick> but
[02:03:03] <iszak> it's wrong
[02:03:08] <iszak> div.lines.alt
[02:03:11] <non-troll-nick> $("div(.likes, .alt):parent").each(function(){   this DOES select the elements which have content
[02:03:13] <non-troll-nick> nono
[02:03:21] <non-troll-nick> i want div.likes and div.alt
[02:03:43] <non-troll-nick> was just experimenting and was surprised that the div(.likes, .alt) works
[02:03:46] <iszak> div.likes, div.alt
[02:03:47] <non-troll-nick> if you add a :parent afterward
[02:03:57] <iszak> non-troll-nick, it probably disregards it?
[02:03:59] <non-troll-nick> iszak: youre missing my point
[02:04:09] <non-troll-nick> yes but why does it work in one instance and doesnt in another
[02:04:19] <iszak> no idea
[02:04:28] <iszak> like I said, it probably disregards the (.likes, .alt)
[02:04:34] <iszak> and skips to the :parent
[02:04:39] <non-troll-nick> DOESNT WORK: $("div(.likes, .alt)")
[02:04:43] <non-troll-nick> WORKS $("div(.likes, .alt):parent")

[02:04:49] <non-troll-nick> ok :P

[02:04:58] <non-troll-nick> i was using caps to distinguish between the code
[02:05:05] <non-troll-nick> nto shouting
[02:05:06] <iszak> you're doing it wrong - it's not meant to give consistent results on wrong code.
[02:05:36] <non-troll-nick> it doesnt skip (.lalalal)
[02:05:49] <non-troll-nick> it doesnt apply the code with other divs
[02:05:53] <non-troll-nick> or with p.alt
[02:06:05] <iszak> submit an issue if you feel it's a problem
[02:06:17] <non-troll-nick> well more of a curiousity than a problem :P
[02:06:29] <iszak> what can I say, nfi

[02:13:53] <magistr> <iszak> why Why so $('#box > p:last') ?
[02:13:53] <magistr> not $('#box  p:last') ?
[02:14:09] <iszak> well > p is immediate child, both works in your case.
[02:14:17] <non-troll-nick> ok http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9515

[02:20:00] <stefancrs> non-troll-nick: did you create that ticket?
[02:20:17] <iszak> magistr, no it's not.
[02:20:42] <magistr> and $('#box p:last') is it a wrong?
[02:20:48] <non-troll-nick> yes stefancrs
[02:21:07] <stefancrs> non-troll-nick: it's... weird. is it a bug? a feature request? it looks like it's just a question
[02:21:24] <non-troll-nick> well i guess it could be a bug of sorts
[02:21:31] <iszak> not really a bug
[02:21:33] <non-troll-nick> just curious to why would it work one way and not work the other
[02:21:37] <stefancrs> non-troll-nick: but you submitted it as a "new feature"
[02:21:40] <iszak> it shouldn't work
[02:21:42] <stefancrs> non-troll-nick: and wrote it like a question
[02:21:47] <non-troll-nick> hmm maybe my bad
[02:21:56] <stefancrs> not "maybe" :)
[02:21:57] <non-troll-nick> should i resubmit it as a bug?
[02:22:00] <non-troll-nick> pfft :P
[02:22:14] <stefancrs> I doubt it
[02:22:25] <stefancrs> I don't think it should be a ticket at all
[02:22:40] <magistr> <non-troll-nick> +1000
[02:22:42] <non-troll-nick> well do you know why would it work one way and not the other?
[02:22:48] <magistr> it is a bug

[04:36:10] <Lundy> heya guys, im using replacewith ... to change a button from <button id="start_package"> to <button id="take"> but the function I have for #take doesnt work not unless the page loads with the button being id="take"
[04:37:24] <Lundy> is there a way of getting it to work?
[04:39:09] <Lundy> 	$("#start_package").replaceWith('<button id="take">Take Turn</button>'); then iv got like ..   $("#take").click(function () { alert("test"); });
[04:39:13] <Lundy> but it doesnt do anything
[04:39:38] <AlecTaylor> hi
[04:39:39] <AlecTaylor> I'm a C++ and Python coder, and am researching various web-frameworks for developing this site: http://i.stack.imgur.com/wVRk7.png. Speed, reliability are more important than development/deployment time for this project.
[04:39:40] <AlecTaylor> Which [preferably C++] web-framework would you recommend?
[04:40:23] <fealls> Lundy: you should probably re-think your design to use classes
[04:40:30] <skylamer`> and the relation between C++ and Jquery is ?
[04:42:02] <Lundy> fealls: but cud it not work by doing it with IDs
[04:42:47] <fealls> it will work if you use $("#take").live("click", function(){ alert("test"); });
[04:44:55] <Lundy> :D sound... it works, thanks
[04:45:23] <fealls> np :)
[04:48:21] <ale_> Hello, I many records from a php file and save them on an html (http://pastebin.com/zNNiXUSC)...the problem is that when I do $('a').click(function(e){ alert('enter'); }); it does not alert...why can this be?
[04:49:53] <Lundy> fealls: works for take but doesnt work for having
[04:49:59] <Lundy> $("#refund_turn").live("click", function () { alert("test");
[04:50:30] <fealls> if thats the exact line you are using, there's a syntax error in the end of it missing });
[04:50:43] <ale_> No, it's not the same result
[04:50:45] <Lundy>   $("#take").live("click", function () { alert("test") }); $("#refund_turn").live("click", function () { alert("test"); });
[04:51:14] <fealls> ale_: sorry wasn't refering to you, was refering to Lundy's question
[04:51:31] <ale_> Oh ok
[04:51:40] <AlecTaylor> skylamer`: Generate JQuery with C++
[04:52:01] <Lundy> fealls: seems strange as im using this in my "start package script" 	$("#start_package").replaceWith('<button id="take">Take Turn</button>'); 	$("#edit_package").replaceWith('<button id="return_turn">Refund Turn</button>');
[04:52:12] <Lundy> ahhhhhhhhh
[04:52:17] <ale_> Could someone help me please?
[04:52:26] <fealls> :)
[04:52:31] <Lundy> fealls: me silly :P
[04:52:32] <fealls> Lundy: I saw what you saw :P
[04:52:42] <fealls> and yeah sec ale_ taking a look
[04:52:55] <ale_> Ok!
[04:53:31] <Lundy> thanks fealls <3
[04:54:52] <dr0id> AlecTaylor: lolwut ?
[04:55:21] <fealls> ale_: I can't really see anything wrong, try to set up an example that isn't working for you at jsfiddle.net or give a link to the actual not working example
[04:56:32] <ThiefMaster> anyone knows if it's possible to have two tooltips on a single element with qtip2?
[04:57:54] <ale_> fealls: the problem of jsfiddle is that when I put the result of the html, and the js, it does work properly, but not on the real page
[04:58:56] <AlecTaylor> dr0id: Wt can do it
[04:59:05] <dr0id> ?
[04:59:46] <fealls> ale_: then maybe there's some syntax error on it? try and debug it, inspect the elements, make sure everything is ok
[05:02:41] <bapi__> How can i apply a live() to a series of div that should make appropiate action when clicked
[05:02:56] <bapi__> $("#toggle a").click(function () { }
[05:03:17] <ale_> fealls: Ok now works, but just on the first record it gets, do you get me?
[05:03:49] <skamikaze> bapi__: $("#toggle").delegate( "a", "click", function () { })
[05:04:09] <ale_> That's it...I added the .live =)
[05:04:16] <fealls> :)
[05:04:42] <bapi__> thanks skam, will try that out
[05:05:45] <Ely2> Hi, i'm trying to make it possible to uncheck the image when it is been checked. http://jsfiddle.net/4KSL9/3/ (it's a drastic way of doing this but i have my reasons)
[05:06:28] <bapi__> it didn't work
[05:08:17] <Diverdude> Is there a dropdownbox dependency plugin for jquery?
[05:10:55] <fealls> Ely2: add a check to the Ax_a/b .click events a check to see if the checkbox is now checked or unchecked, and if it's unchecked then you should remove the X, else do the other stuff you did there...
[05:11:28] <Ely2> because the radiobutton checked and unchecking is working when clicking the image as you can see http://jsfiddle.net/4KSL9/4/
[05:11:36] <mightym> or maybe someone could explain to me why $.get('template.htm') does work on my webserver but not on my local machine?
[05:12:04] <Ely2> and on the click i've added $('.A6_a').attr('src', 'http://www.boinxx.com/Portals/_default/Skins/Boinxx/images/prijzen/A6_1000.jpg'); if it's unchecked
[05:12:09] <Ely2> crap
[05:12:14] <Ely2> $('.A6_a').attr('src', '/Portals/_default/Skins/Boinxx/images/prijzen/A6_1000.jpg');
[05:13:30] <Diverdude> any1?
[05:16:22] <fealls> Ely2: sorry that code is just way too messy to read.. try debugging with some alert()s and see where does it get to

[05:33:47] <oquidave> hello people
[05:37:10] <simmel> How can I search/find in an JSON object contained in variable named "fax"?
[05:40:33] <notuo> Hello all. Newbie here. Do you think anyone can tell me why this sample first "blinks" for a moment and then start the animation?  http://216.59.5.83/~talento/p1a.html
[05:50:26] <ryrych> hi guys
[05:51:19] <ryrych> is it safe to replace this snippet: http://pastie.org/2018106 with something more up-to-date? I mean onload on images, especially in IEs
[05:51:20] <sokie_de> dzien dobry
[05:51:31] <ryrych> sokie_de: dzień dobry :)
[05:52:23] <ryrych> I used to this one but I am not sure if I can replace it with something jQuerish
[05:55:22] <sokie_de> you can use load(function(){ your code}) on any Element to be executed when its loaded
[05:55:27] <sokie_de> ?load
[05:55:28] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[05:56:41] <ryrych> sokie_de: as far as I remember correctly I had problems with .load on an image and IE7. But thanks – I'll give it another try and first google for it
[05:57:27] <sokie_de> I sometimes .load() especially when it comes to IEs
[06:00:01] <ale_> hello, why can I be receiving an [object Object] from an ajax request?
[06:00:24] <ryrych> sokie_de: take a look at this: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/fixing-load-in-ie-for-cached-images/ I think it will help me
[06:01:30] <ryrych> ale: do you mean you want to receive an object?
[06:03:30] <sokie_de> yes thats why i use it for the IE, since is gives you troubles in automated image rotations (like i.e cycle etc)
[06:04:20] <sokie_de> so i start running the script not on document ready but on $(lastimage).load()
[06:04:42] <sokie_de> worked for me
[06:04:53] <ryrych> sokie_de: thanks :)

[06:11:22] <tokyo534> 			
[06:13:45] <ryrych> sokie_de: in what cases is .error() called on an image?
[06:14:11] <ryrych> onabort? onerror?
[06:14:55] <sokie_de> The error event is sent to elements, such as images, that are referenced by a document and loaded by the browser. It is called if the element was not loaded correctly.

[06:24:48] <SuperRoach> Hello. Jquery-ui tabs can be called on a set list items. Can it be defined to work with fieldsets ?
[06:25:56] <sokie_de> you can have elements of fieldset in an unordered list
[06:26:24] <SuperRoach> sokie_de, as in wrapping them each in an li?
[06:26:32] <sokie_de> yup
[06:26:40] <SuperRoach> feels a bit cludgy :/
[06:26:50] <sokie_de> easiest way to get it working with the tabs
[06:27:46] <notuo> Anyone?  Hello all. Newbie here. Do you think anyone can tell me why this sample first "blinks" for a moment and then start the animation?  http://216.59.5.83/~talento/p1a.html
[06:28:24] <SuperRoach> "blinks"? seems to fade into place here
[06:30:35] <sokie_de> is there a jquery method "center"?

[06:44:41] <beakybal4> hi, has anyone here used blueimp's jquery file uploader before?
[06:44:46] <beakybal4> geekbuntu_: hey
[06:44:51] <beakybal4> geekbuntu__: hey
[06:52:46] <flea> is it possible to obtain just the inner html of "#main" from an HTML type URL using .get() ?
[07:01:48] <RobertX> Hi. I need some assistance
[07:02:00] <RobertX> I am doing a time based image fader
[07:02:15] <RobertX> You can check it here
[07:02:24] <RobertX> http://aravindsrivats.co.cc/index.php
[07:02:39] <RobertX> It works when I use that alert box to show the value
[07:02:47] <RobertX> But WHen I remove alert(), its bugged
[07:03:23] <Alexintosh> bye
[07:04:21] <RobertX> http://pastebin.com/hb29gSSg
[07:04:28] <RobertX> This is the snippet
[07:05:30] <sebbarre> RobertX what happens when you don't have alert()?  nothing?
[07:06:11] <RobertX> I show you
[07:06:53] <RobertX> Check http://aravindsrivats.co.cc/index.php
[07:07:06] <RobertX> After a few images have faded
[07:07:15] <RobertX> There will be images swapping frequently
[07:07:33] <RobertX> Like flickers
[07:10:09] <RobertX> Can you see the difference?
[07:10:18] <sebbarre> what's the purpose of the clearInterval(timer) in your slideSwitch() function?
[07:10:45] <sebbarre> since you are just re-setting it in callFunc() anyways no?
[07:10:59] <sebbarre> is it to stop the timer while the animation plays?
[07:11:49] <sebbarre> I think that might be related to it?  you call animate(), which is (not sure?) async, and then callFunc() is set right away
[07:11:56] <sebbarre> try putting callFunc() in the animate() callback instead perhaps
[07:14:59] <RobertX> Thank you. Placing callFunc() inside the animate() worked :)
[07:15:11] <RobertX> But removing clearInterval did not work.
[07:15:21] <kataire> What is the easiest way to check the tag name of $(this)? I could do $this.is(some_tag_name), but that smacks of terrible overhead.
[07:15:25] <sebbarre> awesome..  my first day on irc and I helped someone.  :-)
[07:15:38] <RobertX> I tried to include clearInterval again and it worked perfectly the way I wanted :)
[07:15:39] <RobertX> Thank you
[07:15:57] <sebbarre> kataire: $(this).el(0).tagName?
[07:16:18] <kataire> Is it .tagName? I wasn't sure.
[07:16:18] <sebbarre> sorry no
[07:16:23] <sebbarre> $(this).get().tagName I think
[07:16:30] <sebbarre> that returns the DOM element itself
[07:16:34] <sebbarre> and I think tagName is a property..
[07:16:40] <sebbarre> going on memory here
[07:16:43] <kataire> What's the difference between $(this)[0] and $(this).get()?
[07:16:55] <sebbarre> that I am not sure
[07:17:24] <sebbarre> according to the docs, it's the same thing
[07:17:27] <sebbarre> http://api.jquery.com/get/
[07:19:24] <RobertX> I dont know about the jQuery but in javascript its element.tagName
[07:19:48] <sebbarre> yeah so using $(this).get() will return the plain JS DOM element, and you can call tagName on that
[07:20:01] <Diverdude> is there any way to avoid firebug to shut down each time a page is loaded or refreshed? It takes a lot of time to sit and open it all the time
[07:20:43] <kataire> For some reason $(this).get().tagName always returns undefined for me (using latest stable Chrome for Windows)
[07:21:08] <balevine> I have function which adds some content to the page.  The javascript in the added content is executing before the DOM has been updated and therefore it cannot find the elements I want it to.  What am I doing wrong?
[07:21:18] <sebbarre> try get(0)
[07:21:20] <RobertX> or probably $(this).tagName
[07:22:38] <RobertX> $(this).attr('tagName');
[07:22:56] <kataire> Ah, yes, it's get(0)
[07:23:11] <sebbarre> yeah get(0).tagName or .attr('tagName') will both work
[07:23:13] <kataire> get() returnes the jQuery object. For some reason,.
[07:23:39] <sebbarre> get() requires a 0-based index for the elements being retrieved by the $() call
[07:23:40] <kataire> sebbarre: You mean prop(). It was attr() before.
[07:24:13] <sebbarre> and probably defaults to returning the jQuery object if nothing is passed to continue with the fluent interface that jQuery loves so much :)
[07:24:24] <RobertX> $(this).attr('tagName'); - returns the tagname in uppercase
[07:24:38] <sebbarre> right..  I was just echoing was RobertX said..  I tend to use get() when I want to access the underlying DOM node either way
[07:25:05] <kataire> RobertX: You mean prop().
[07:25:23] <kataire> RobertX: Thanks, though.
[07:26:01] <kataire> Is there a way to reduce a jQuery object collection to a single element other than $($something.get(0))?
[07:26:21] <RobertX> attr() and prop() seem to be the same
[07:26:34] <kataire> first(). Doh. I'm dumb.
[07:26:47] <sebbarre> RobertX in the new jQuery there's a difference between attr() and prop()..  It was in the release notes for 1.6.1 I think
[07:26:48] <kataire> RobertX: Not anymore they aren't. attr() is now only for attributes IIRC.
[07:27:11] <kataire> sebbarre: They introduced that in a micro release? WTF?
[07:27:17] <sebbarre> or 1.6 I forget
[07:27:30] <kataire> I'd hope it's 1.6. It's a backwards-incompatible change.
[07:27:37] <sebbarre> must have been then
[07:27:58] <kataire> The only thing I know that breaks backwards-compatibility in micro-releases is PHP.
[07:28:19] <RobertX> Damn I should update mysql :(
[07:28:24] <RobertX> myself ^^
[07:28:42] <RobertX> I still use 1.5
[07:29:58] <djQuery> sebbarre: .prop was introduced in 1.6  there were some changes in 1.61 to make attr work more like it used to.
[07:30:19] <djQuery> kataire: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[07:33:48] <mightym> hey guys, im new to js/jquery. i wonder if someone could explain to me why $.get() on a path of my webserver works, but on my local machine not ... does it need a http response?
[07:33:59] <kataire> djQuery: Ah
[07:34:22] <kataire> RobertX: I detest PHP. I'm happy I don't have to use it anymore.
[07:44:49] <SuperRoach> on default settings for me, tabs makes the font-size very large... where would be the best way to investigate what causes it?  The tab text, and contents are made larger
[07:55:50] <beakybal4> anyone here familiar with blueimp's jquery file uploader?
[07:55:51] <beakybal4> \
[07:59:29] <raRaRa> Hiya, what is a good way to detect mouse up event outside the website?
[07:59:58] <raRaRa> E.g. someone drags an element and the mouse is released outside the window of the browser, and it'll never detect the release
[08:01:47] <m0dmd> sup people!
[08:02:46] <deam> how can I trigger an event on multiple selectboxes that have the same class? Is that even possible? I tried using: $(".control_type").change(function() { but that didn't work
[08:03:28] <raRaRa> Nevermind, I used body instead of window
[08:03:56] <beakybal4> anyone here use blueimp's jquery file uploader?
[08:32:31] <muasif80> I am trying to call event.preventEvent on a form  submission but it is not working. can any one tell what could be the reason?
[08:33:36] <muasif80> event.preventDefault in fact
[08:39:53] <t0nttu> any way to use shorthand with .css() ?
[08:53:20] <SuperRoach> does jquery support removing multiple classes in one selector? ie $("#someElement").removeClass("foo1,class2")
[08:55:12] <jonathansampson> Separate by spaces.
[08:55:29] <jonathansampson> Remove that semicolon from your selector too :)
[08:55:53] <jonathansampson> Move it to the end of the line instead.
[08:56:38] <jonathansampson> $("#myEl").removeClass("foo bar");
[08:57:48] <jonathansampson> Not sure why it is putting a semicolon in my selector. Not supposed to be there though.
[09:00:36] <kataire> Given an array containing duplicates, is there a straightforward way to reduce it to unique values?
[09:01:21] <jonathansampson> Duplicates of what? Elements, strings, numbers?
[09:01:44] <kataire> Strings in this case.
[09:02:24] <ajpiano> kataire, there's an impl for that in underscore.js https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/blob/master/underscore.js#L337-342
[09:02:26] <kataire> In Python this would be done by converting the list into a set, but my JavaScript is a bit rusty.
[09:03:11] <kataire> ajpiano: Line 337? L337? Can that be a coincidence?
[09:03:25] <ajpiano> i think it *definitely* is a coincidence
[09:04:11] <kataire> It's a conspiracy!
[09:04:33] <jonathansampson> kataire: A quick search on stack overflow turned up several methods od reducing an array to unique values only.
[09:06:06] <kataire> jonathansampson: Oh, right. StackOverflow. Sorry, I'm a bit dizzy.
[09:06:24] <jonathansampson> Hehe, no problem :)
[09:13:36] <Aggrav9d> hi, jquery.  I have a stupid ajax problem.  http://pastebin.com/ZM8r9czd  anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
[09:19:04] <t0nttu> I want to manipulate the border-image property, but it has to be shorthand css, because browsers only accept that
[09:20:46] <psilo2> what?
[09:21:14] <psilo2> only shorthand, that seems odd
[09:24:15] <eN_Joy_> can someone help me on this: i am trying to implement a jCarousel slideshow here: http://memories.blogsite.org, i want to implement the looking of http://one.org, e.g., show half of the images on prev and next, i have googled around, don't seem to get a definitive answer...
[09:27:19] <cooki3s> hi, little question about selectors.. is: $('div.set:last-child').remove(); wrong syntax to remove the last div with class .set?
[09:27:25] <t0nttu> psilo2: yes, only shorthand, according to the Browser quirks -part of this article http://css-tricks.com/understanding-border-image/
[09:30:47] <ThiefMaster> which jquery-based colorpicker would you suggest? farbtastic looks nice but i heard it's not jquery 1.6 compatible
[09:34:59] <oquidave> hello guys
[09:35:09] <flea> is it possible to render inner html of a div of another page using .load or .get ?
[09:35:17] <oquidave> does anyone know a good ide for jquery or with jquery support
[09:35:33] <mipo> hi
[09:35:58] <mipo> oquidave , did you work with Aptana?
[09:36:13] <Krinkle> cooki3s: yes
[09:36:21] <oquidave> mipo, that is what am trying out now, but sofar am not impressed
[09:36:36] <oquidave> am not seeing any autocompletion
[09:36:38] <Krinkle> cooki3s: last-child selects the last one within that tree of the page, not the entire page
[09:37:03] <Krinkle> cooki3s: use $( '.set' ).last().remove() if you only want to remove 1 element on the page.
[09:37:05] <Krinkle> (the last one)
[09:37:10] <oquidave> code hightlighting and all that...am using aptana plugin for eclipse
[09:37:22] <oquidave> unless am missing something
[09:37:43] <mipo> oquidave , check this out : aptana.com
[09:37:44] * Krinkle gooles
[09:37:56] <Krinkle> holy moly, eclipse is finally for Mac.
[09:38:13] <oquidave> mipo, what do u mean, i go to the site?
[09:38:31] <cooki3s> Krinkle: ok thx ill try it out
[09:38:46] <raRaRa> Hmmm, is there any way to detect mouse over and mouse release over an iframe?
[09:38:50] <Krinkle> ?last
[09:38:53] <raRaRa> I mean, mouse move over iframe
[09:39:03] <Krinkle> raRaRa: I doubt it
[09:39:06] <raRaRa> Arr
[09:39:25] <Krinkle> iframes are secured, and need be for a reason (cross-site security)
[09:39:32] <raRaRa> Yeah :o/
[09:39:37] <mipo> you want good ide, I say maybe this can help you!
[09:39:38] <Krinkle> if your plans are not evil, using iframes is likely the wrong way to do it.
[09:39:46] <raRaRa> Krinkle: I'm just embedding game on my site
[09:39:52] <raRaRa> and I have all these UI around it
[09:39:57] <Krinkle> well, I'd say link to it in a popup.
[09:40:07] <Krinkle> Or work together with the game author.
[09:40:07] <raRaRa> I like to keep it inside the page
[09:40:23] <mipo> oquidave , that's program , no online!! download!!
[09:40:38] <mipo> oquidave ,maybe this can help you!
[09:40:50] <Krinkle> raRaRa: Imagine someone embedding a bank site and overlaying numbers with other numbers (ie. your account is in the iframe, but you overlay it with that of Greenpeace)
[09:41:15] <Aggrav9d> http://pastebin.com/ZM8r9czd  anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
[09:41:21] <Krinkle> not even bother continueing, it wont work clean or cross-browser (if at all) and is generally evil :P
[09:41:42] <raRaRa> Yeah I understand the security issue
[09:42:05] <mipo> oquidave , see here http://docs.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Getting_started_with_Aptana_and_jQuery
[09:42:17] <Krinkle> There's no window.location.getAttribute('is-evil'), and untill there is iframes will disallow everything raRaRa
[09:42:42] <raRaRa> I was just hoping that mouse coordinate and mouse release would not be a security issue above the iframe container
[09:42:53] <raRaRa> but I think one solution would be to hide the iframe while interacting with the UI
[09:43:28] <Krinkle> raRaRa: I dont know the game or your UI, but if you think it's useful (which I guess you think it is), talk to the game maker. It's worth a shot :)
[09:43:50] <raRaRa> It's angry birds (web chrome app)
[09:45:34] <cooki3s> Krinkle: is there a trick like after() for insertAfter() too? because $('.set:last-child') doesn't work like before :-(
[09:46:04] <raRaRa> Arr, I can't even .animate the iframe! :)
[09:46:39] <raRaRa> oh, nevermind, problem on my side
[09:46:39] <Krinkle> cooki3s: I'm not sure I understand... What are you trying to do ?
[09:47:20] <Krinkle> Try me.
[09:48:05] <cooki3s> Krinkle: sorry i was stupid- noticed that after() has a parameter to add html after that element, but for some reason my selection doesnt work :s $('.set:last-child').after('<div class="set 1">hello</div>');
[09:48:35] <cooki3s> should it be "" for the selection? *wild guess*
[09:49:21] <Krinkle> cooki3s: ?
[09:49:28] <Krinkle> Where do you want t insert that html ?
[09:50:03] <Krinkle> $() is the selector. after() inserts something after that.
[09:50:19] <Krinkle> Perhaps you want $('body').append( ...html.. or ..$().. result )
[09:50:22] <cooki3s> right after my last<div class="set"></div>
[09:50:41] <Krinkle> cooki3s: So you have a <div class="set"> already ?
[09:50:43] <Krinkle> on the page
[09:50:51] <cooki3s> yes several
[09:51:48] <Krinkle> $( '.set' ).last().after( '<div class="set">hello</div>' );
[09:51:49] <cooki3s> i have a form with 2 of those with input text fields, and im trying to create another same div when i click a button, a third set
[09:52:06] <Krinkle> Oh, in that case..
[09:52:10] <eN_Joy_> some nice spirit pls help;-) how do i make the slideshow display half image of both prev and next on http://memories.blogsite.org/? like we see on htte://one.org? many thanks...
[09:52:28] <Krinkle> $( '#myForm' ).append( '<div class="set">hello</div>' );
[09:52:35] <Krinkle> or:
[09:52:38] <cooki3s> krinkle: ur first thing worked great thx
[09:53:07] <Krinkle> $newSet = $('<div>').addClass('set').text( 'hello' ); $( '#myForm' ).append( $newSet );
[09:53:13] <Krinkle> That may be better ^
[09:53:19] <Krinkle> and also easier to use different text()
[09:55:53] <Krinkle-dinner> brb
[09:58:20] <cooki3s> Krinkle-dinner: enjoy :-)
[10:08:37] <Aggrav9d> http://pastebin.com/ZM8r9czd  anyone know what I'm doing wrong?  (explanation in pastebin)
[10:08:37] <d4rklit3> hey, quick question..   can i do $(element).ready(function);  like $(document).ready    , i ask because the element is an iframe and i need to write a script on it
[10:08:47] <d4rklit3> but it needs to be when its ready
[10:08:53] <Aggrav9d> yes you can
[10:09:15] <Aggrav9d> but try it and see instead of believing me
[10:09:37] <d4rklit3> doesn't work
[10:09:45] <d4rklit3> ("#navigation iframe").ready(function ()
[10:09:45] <d4rklit3>   {
[10:09:49] <d4rklit3> doesn't wait for the page to load
[10:09:58] <d4rklit3> the iframe that is
[10:11:02] <d4rklit3> Aggrav9d: check your console
[10:11:09] <d4rklit3> see the response from .get
[10:11:14] <Aggrav9d> none
[10:11:17] <raRaRa> d4rklit3: I don't think you can access anything related to the iframe contents
[10:11:30] <d4rklit3> raRaRa: i can, as long as it loads on the page
[10:11:32] <raRaRa> and I guess that includes the ready event for the iframe
[10:11:37] <d4rklit3> raRaRa: don't i know you from somewhere
[10:11:41] <raRaRa> yeah
[10:11:46] <d4rklit3> :P
[10:11:58] <raRaRa> not sure though, actionscript? flash?
[10:12:05] <d4rklit3> yah as
[10:12:23] <d4rklit3> Aggrav9d: did you write that service?
[10:12:49] <Aggrav9d> yes
[10:12:56] <Aggrav9d> it's on the same domain.
[10:12:59] <d4rklit3> i usually set up my services to return json
[10:13:05] <d4rklit3> of what is going on
[10:13:13] <d4rklit3> lke if something goes wrong, it'll spit out json
[10:13:18] <d4rklit3> telling you the problem
[10:13:18] <Aggrav9d> i'm not getting anything back.
[10:13:29] <d4rklit3> have you tested it independelty
[10:13:35] <d4rklit3> raRaRa: so what are you saying?
[10:13:58] <d4rklit3> there is no way to test if an iframe is loaded
[10:14:33] <Aggrav9d> you could put a js method at the end of the file that calls a function in the parent.
[10:14:50] <Aggrav9d> I_am_ready_now(this); or something.
[10:15:10] <d4rklit3> yeah but how do i test for the iframe to be ready
[10:16:53] <d4rklit3> stackoverflow says i need to load the iframe w/ jquery
[10:17:33] <d4rklit3> i feel like an asshole
[10:17:39] <d4rklit3> ifc pushed this page live yesterday
[10:17:43] <d4rklit3> but the fuckin nav
[10:17:50] <d4rklit3> doesn't work unless you previously loaded the page
[10:20:34] <djQuery> d4rklit3: damn I hate iframes.
[10:22:27] <d4rklit3> yeah me too
[10:22:31] <d4rklit3> not much choice here dude
[10:22:37] <d4rklit3> ifc are a bunch of assholes
[10:22:43] <d4rklit3> who can't make a proper include package
[10:22:46] <d4rklit3> for their navigations
[10:23:45] <djQuery> d4rklit3: $('#content').load('iframeurl.html/php/aspx/orwhatever');  tada got the cotnent and now there is no iframe
[10:25:06] <oquidave> hello guys
[10:25:08] <oquidave> how can make eclipse javascript development tool support jquery javascript framework? thanks
[10:26:41] <d4rklit3> djQuery: believe when i tell you, that is not a road i would wish upon anyone to go down
[10:26:44] <d4rklit3> for this occasion
[10:26:55] <amid_hasan> hello everyone
[10:27:15] <d4rklit3> you see ifc has a lot of crazy style sheets that just love to interfere with the rest my page
[10:27:44] <d4rklit3> so the only way to make this peice of the page look / act right is to encapsulate it into an iframe
[10:28:10] <d4rklit3> got it working anyway
[10:28:55] <d4rklit3> aggrav8d: did u get it working
[10:29:01] <aggrav8d> nope.  not since yesterday
[10:29:44] <aggrav8d> i don't get any errors, i know the requested url is working.  the callback is never activated and i see no request in the NET tab so I suspect the browser is not sending anything to the server.
[10:30:13] <d4rklit3> are you sure you have your rewrite engine on
[10:30:27] <d4rklit3> test the service without jquery in the browser
[10:30:35] <d4rklit3> if it uses post, just make a quick form
[10:30:49] <aggrav8d> i did test it.
[10:31:14] <d4rklit3> and it works
[10:31:15] <aggrav8d> that's why i say i know the requested url is working.  http://dev.mygardenfootprint.com/ingredient/suggest?match=o
[10:31:40] <d4rklit3> where is your file making the call
[10:31:52] <d4rklit3> i know /ingredients/suggest points from the root
[10:31:57] <d4rklit3> but maybe its having problems
[10:32:04] <d4rklit3> try ../../ instead
[10:33:05] <aggrav8d> but it starts with /!  it's absolute to the domain root.
[10:33:10] <d4rklit3> yeah it should be
[10:33:13] <aggrav8d> ../../ won't make a difference.
[10:33:15] <d4rklit3> it should work
[10:33:16] <d4rklit3> :P
[10:33:22] <d4rklit3> check spelling?
[10:33:41] <aggrav8d> yep
[10:33:45] <d4rklit3> damn weird
[10:33:56] <aggrav8d> no request is going out.  not sure why.
[10:34:10] <d4rklit3> yeah that is weird
[10:34:30] <d4rklit3> the console panel doesn't show jquery making the get request
[10:34:36] <d4rklit3> and niethe does the net panel?
[10:38:09] <aggrav8d> correct.
[10:38:18] <aggrav8d> console doesn't normally show get requests, does it?
[10:38:25] * aggrav8d doesn't remember
[10:38:48] <amid_hasan> Can someone quickly tell me how this photo gallery pulls in images/work without refresh? How can this be done in jQuery? http://www.newsweek.com/photo/2011/05/29/iranian-students-ziyah-gafic.html
[10:39:25] <aggrav8d> oh fuck, i think I found it.  I wrote $(). instead of $.
[10:40:06] <aggrav8d> one day i will snap and invent a language in which you cannot make syntax errors, only logical ones.
[10:44:19] <Obvious> aggrav8d, that's perl.
[10:45:09] <Obvious> you can do 'cat /dev/urandom | strings | perl' and it will probably be valid.
[10:45:11] <Qantourisc> Anyone any idea why opera doesn't run jquery on localhost ?
[10:45:17] <Qantourisc> i mean in file:/// ?
[10:45:53] <Obvious> Qantourisc, file:/// is root of file system. why don't you just use relative path?
[10:45:58] <d4rklit3> lol aggrav8d
[10:46:00] <d4rklit3> ya
[10:46:05] <d4rklit3> its not $().get
[10:46:07] <d4rklit3> its $.get
[10:47:03] <d4rklit3> i do that shit all the itme
[10:47:03] <d4rklit3> time
[10:47:35] <Qantourisc> Obvious: doesn't work
[10:47:53] <Qantourisc> Obvious: it does work when you start dragonfly (firebug for opera)
[10:48:03] <amid_hasan> how does this photo gallery work? http://www.newsweek.com/photo/2011/05/29/iranian-students-ziyah-gafic.html
[10:48:04] <Qantourisc> Obvious: so i'm thinking it's protected... maybe more a question for #opera :)
[10:51:36] <d4rklit3> amid_hasan: what do u mean
[10:51:40] <d4rklit3> how does it work
[10:51:51] <d4rklit3> it uses logic
[10:53:07] <amid_hasan> d4klit3: how does it pull in the picture w/o refresh, the next button: what does it do?
[10:53:31] <amid_hasan> d4klit3: the pictures, are they stored in an object, i.e. name of picture, desc, url of image, etc
[10:53:43] <d4rklit3> thats up to you
[10:53:51] <d4rklit3> you can store them in xml
[10:53:53] <d4rklit3> json
[10:53:58] <d4rklit3> err
[10:53:59] <d4rklit3> no
[10:54:06] <amid_hasan> not json?
[10:54:10] <d4rklit3> you can store them on a database
[10:54:16] <d4rklit3> well u can make a json file but why :P
[10:54:28] <amid_hasan> db would work
[10:54:48] <amid_hasan> so, the magic in that photo gallery is due to ajax calls to a script?
[10:54:52] <d4rklit3> yeah
[10:54:57] <d4rklit3> have you read jquery tutorials
[10:55:02] <amid_hasan> but how do you identify which image you're on?
[10:55:14] <d4rklit3> for loops dude
[10:55:21] <d4rklit3> make an xml file
[10:55:22] <amid_hasan> d4klit3: yes, but i haven't seen anything like this
[10:55:27] <d4rklit3> use jquery.load()
[10:55:39] <d4rklit3> put the xml image items into an array of objects
[10:55:47] <d4rklit3> then use that array to build your gallery
[10:55:51] <K1ng> do you know any slider like this? http://web1.digitalmotionsolutions.com/beechwoodhomes.com/gallery.cfm
[10:56:07] <amid_hasan> the array will be multidimensional?
[10:56:20] <d4rklit3> no
[10:56:53] <d4rklit3> array[0] = {src: '', width: '', height: '', etc...}
[10:56:59] <amid_hasan> i.e. "item 1" : {['123','image name','helloworld.jpg,'some description test']}, "item 2" ... etc
[10:57:06] <amid_hasan> oh
[10:58:28] <amid_hasan> so var photoarray = {}; array[0] = {src: '', width: '', height: '', etc...} array[1] = {src: '', width: '', height: '', etc...}
[10:58:43] <amid_hasan> then for loop
[10:58:56] <d4rklit3> yeah sure
[10:58:59] <amid_hasan> and load inside the for loop?
[10:59:04] <d4rklit3> i guess photoarray = [];
[10:59:10] <d4rklit3> {} would make it an object
[10:59:20] <d4rklit3> there is a different in actionscript
[10:59:28] <d4rklit3> not sure about js
[10:59:54] <amid_hasan> do i need to put a var when creating a new array in js?
[11:00:42] <d4rklit3> basically if you put var it makes it local to your method
[11:00:48] <d4rklit3> if you don't it makes it global
[11:00:58] <amid_hasan> makes sense. thanks!
[11:01:24] <amid_hasan> and i would attach a click handler to the next button to go to the next image?
[11:01:39] <amid_hasan> and increment value on the array?
[11:04:26] <dabear> logical choice, calling a variable photoarray and then assign an object to it instead
[11:06:14] <amid_hasan> i will try this out
[11:06:58] <d4rklit3> amid
[11:07:09] <d4rklit3> http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials
[11:07:11] <d4rklit3> do those
[11:07:16] <d4rklit3> it will take you less than an hour
[11:07:18] <d4rklit3> to go through them
[11:07:42] <d4rklit3> http://jsfiddle.net/
[11:07:50] <d4rklit3> use that to quickly prototype code
[11:08:06] <amid_hasan> d4rklit3: thank you. i will do this now
[11:08:12] <d4rklit3> just make sure you select jquery for the framework
[11:08:37] <amid_hasan> :P my previous mistake was forgetting to set to jQuery. i was so stumped to find out none of my code worked
[11:08:39] <amid_hasan> haha
[11:08:45] <amid_hasan> it was all set to mootols
[11:08:49] <amid_hasan> *Mootools
[11:08:49] <d4rklit3> yeah
[11:08:54] <d4rklit3> mootools ftl
[11:08:57] * amid_hasan dope
[11:16:59] <GoGoGarrett> 1
[11:17:41] <dabear> 2
[11:22:02] <amid_hasan> be back later
[11:26:25] <Osama> hi
[11:26:44] <Osama> hi
[11:26:51] <Osama> i need help
[11:27:33] <raRaRa> We're not psychic, so please state your question.
[11:29:55] <Osama> ok my queston
[11:30:01] <Osama> is about a proxy script
[11:30:10] <Osama> the developer had a comment in it
[11:30:15] <Osama> to how to use it to click
[11:30:18] <Osama> look
[11:30:18] <Osama>   // Clicking sample remote urls should populate the "Remote URL" box.   $('#sample a').click(function(){     $('#url').val( $(this).attr( 'href' ) );     return false;   }); });
[11:30:21] <Osama> how to use this code
[11:30:45] <Osama> ?
[11:30:58] <sebbarre> Osama: your question is unclear... what are you trying to do exactly?
[11:31:10] <Osama> this script
[11:31:11] <Osama> http://benalman.com/code/projects/php-simple-proxy/examples/simple/
[11:31:16] <Osama> its a php proxy
[11:31:25] <Osama> used to open urls and get some sources of it
[11:31:31] <Osama> im currently using it to look into the page
[11:31:34] <Osama> and get the result
[11:31:47] <Osama> ok my request now is to know how to make this script click onto something in the page
[11:32:04] <Osama> there is a comment in this script about this but i dont know how to use it
[11:32:14] <Osama> at the bottom of the page
[11:32:17] <Osama> in code frame
[11:32:20] <Osama> you will see this
[11:32:24] <Osama>   // Clicking sample remote urls should populate the "Remote URL" box.   $('#sample a').click(function(){     $('#url').val( $(this).attr( 'href' ) );     return false;   }); });
[11:32:59] <Osama> anyone can help here ?
[11:33:05] <bot-t> (774 hours ago) <dytrivedi> tell osama obama is not dead. He's in #jquery, #jquery-ot and #html5
[11:33:21] <sebbarre> All that code does is populate the links below the Remote URL box into the box for testing in his example
[11:33:23] <Osama> S:
[11:33:27] <sebbarre> I don't think it's related to the proxy code at all
[11:33:35] <Osama> it's
[11:33:51] <Osama> the codes in this code frame are used in the script
[11:34:03] <Osama> so this code could be used
[11:34:04] <sebbarre> at the top of the page there's an input called "Remote URL" and below it are a list of sample links (Github, JSON etc)..
[11:34:05] <Osama> but i dont know how
[11:34:12] <Osama> yea
[11:34:23] <remyo> Is there a static address where I can always grab the latest jquery? I was going to make a shell script that pulled it into a local dir so I always had it onhand when working offline
[11:34:31] <sebbarre> that code just sets up a click event to put that link's value into the input box
[11:34:32] <sebbarre> that's all it does
[11:34:51] <Osama> ok how ?
[11:34:56] <Osama> how even if it was in input box
[11:34:59] <sebbarre> how what?  you asked what that part of code does
[11:35:21] <Osama> how to make it click on something on the link i have requested using that input box ?
[11:35:45] <sebbarre> I'm not sure about that..  but like I said the code you referred to just populates the input box, that's it
[11:36:14] <Osama> ok do u know any php proxy that would click ?
[11:36:31] <Iarfen> hi
[11:36:40] <Iarfen> how i can get the text inside a textarea?
[11:36:47] <sebbarre> Osama: I'm not really sure what you are trying to accomplish so it's hard to answer your question..
[11:36:50] <Iarfen> using jquery...
[11:36:53] <gnarf> Iarfen: see ?val
[11:37:04] <Iarfen> val is for textarea or only for input?
[11:37:13] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/val
[11:37:22] <bot-t> Iarfen, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[11:37:34] <Osama> sebbarre: Can i have your email address and do something for me, i would pay you for it
[11:38:00] <sebbarre> sorry I don't do work for hire :)
[11:38:16] <Osama> aren't you programmer ?
[11:38:18] <sebbarre> I am
[11:38:24] <Osama> for it
[11:38:24] <Osama> help me in programming something
[11:38:26] <Osama> and i will pay real money
[11:38:34] <sebbarre> but I doubt you can afford my rates and my workload is pretty full right now
[11:38:38] <sebbarre> maybe someone else can help you
[11:38:58] <Osama> its not something hard
[11:39:05] <sebbarre> then you should have no trouble finding help ;)
[11:39:08] <Osama> anyways ok ty
[11:39:11] <sebbarre> good luck!
[11:39:15] <Osama> ty :)
[11:41:52] <kybalion> hi
[11:45:00] <thathurts> i read on the jquery blog that they were going to roll back the changes to .attr(), but they didn't. you still have to use .prop() for properties in jquery 1.6.1
[12:00:20] <gnarf> thathurts: we didn't roll back changes, we meerly made the common issues (checked, selected, disabled, the other "boolean" attrs) a little more back compat in how they deal with .attr() --- .prop() should still be used for properties though
[12:04:02] <babonk> when I call $.ajax, will my code move on to the next line before the call is complete?  e.g. $.ajax(..);alert("hi"); would alert immediately occur after the request was sent?
[12:08:20] <Shrink> What is the best way to receive streaming chunked (text) data and show in browser, using JQuery?
[12:13:02] <sgc2c>  
[12:16:20] <snover> Shrink: the best way to do that is to not use jquery, because its ajax implementation does not support that
[12:16:45] <Shrink> snover, Yes. Figures.
[12:17:41] <Shrink> snover, any pointers how else? I was hoping something could be done using the jqXHR Object. Is that possible?
[12:17:47] <snover> no
[12:17:53] <Shrink> ok
[12:33:50] <GoGoGarrett> I am not sure if this is with jquery, or pure javascript.  But I am trying to load a image gallery populated with images from a facebook album.  I can get the list of all the photos in JSON form, but i'm a noob and I'm not sure how to populate the images in the gallery from this returned data.  Anyone know any sources I can read online with information on how to do this?   ( https://graph.facebook.com/99394368305 ) example of what is returned from
[12:33:50] <GoGoGarrett> facebook's api
[12:40:22] <m0dmd> GoGoGarrett you have to learn a little jQuery my friend
[12:40:32] <m0dmd> yo cakehero what r u doing in hear!
[12:40:40] <m0dmd> :)
[12:41:13] <cakehero> m0dmd sup dawg
[12:41:18] <m0dmd> heh sup brotha
[12:41:28] <m0dmd> just here working on this fb app
[12:41:31] <cakehero> m0dmd i do cakePHP, jquery, git, ROR, CSS, flex, flash, and selenium
[12:41:35] <cakehero> m0dmd do you need help?
[12:41:37] <m0dmd> finishing up some projects for clients n stuff
[12:41:40] <cakehero> cool
[12:41:41] <m0dmd> nah no help needed bud!
[12:41:50] <cakehero> I'm thinking about writing a helper today
[12:41:53] <cakehero> time localization
[12:41:54] <m0dmd> get out
[12:41:59] <m0dmd> that would help
[12:42:02] <cakehero> yeah
[12:42:04] <m0dmd> there is none already for cake?
[12:42:06] <cakehero> nope
[12:42:08] <cakehero> I have one
[12:42:12] <cakehero> CakeDC wrote it
[12:42:16] <cakehero> but it's no good (not their fault)
[12:42:21] <cakehero> it just wasn't fully thought out at the time
[12:42:25] <cakehero> and I've fully thought it out now
[12:42:27] <cakehero> so I think I'm going to writ eit
[12:42:28] <m0dmd> sweet man
[12:42:34] <m0dmd> i'm probably going to get back into cakephp soon
[12:42:43] <m0dmd> going to read the documentation from start to finish again :)
[12:42:46] <m0dmd> like it did last time!
[12:46:58] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: You can totally do that,
[12:47:13] <ryanneufeld> ?$.each() @ GoGoGarrett
[12:47:15] <bot-t> GoGoGarrett, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:47:26] <ryanneufeld> ?.attr() @ GoGoGarrett
[12:47:27] <bot-t> GoGoGarrett, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[12:49:17] <GoGoGarrett> So I'd loop through each element being passed back, set the src attr equal to the source being passed back from the api?
[12:49:28] <ryanneufeld> bingo
[12:49:53] <GoGoGarrett> Sweet, thanks a lot man.
[12:50:00] <ryanneufeld> if you want to to display more than one
[12:50:18] <ryanneufeld> then you could just create some image elements and add them as you go
[12:50:34] <GoGoGarrett> within the each loop?
[12:50:39] <ryanneufeld> yes
[12:51:17] <GoGoGarrett> like document.createElement('img') and then hoax the src to be what is being passed
[12:51:20] <thathurts> if i'm using jquery .delegate(), is there a way to clear out the event delegation that i've defined? i'm finding that if i keep running it, it just keeps adding more and more event delegation
[12:51:50] <systemfault> thathurts: You do it "once"
[12:51:54] <m0dmd> GoGoGarrett like that but better :)
[12:52:01] <systemfault> thathurts: That's the whole point of event delegation.
[12:52:10] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: yes, like that
[12:52:25] <thathurts> systemfault: but i'm dynamically creating table rows in code, and i need to set up the event delegation every time a new table with different data is made
[12:52:40] <ryanneufeld> GoGoGarrett: looks like you need to build the image urls somehow tooo
[12:53:06] <thathurts> systemfault: you're saying i don't have to run it multiple times?
[12:53:08] <GoGoGarrett> I'm content with not linking back to facebook and just having the tiny'er thumbnail verisons
[12:53:36] <ryanneufeld> cool, I mean I don't see any urls in that json
[12:53:36] <systemfault> thathurts: The point is to use bubbling to catch events at a "higher point" in the dom tree
[12:53:51] <ryanneufeld> I'm not familiar with the FB graph api though
[12:53:52] <thathurts> systemfault: gotcha. thanks
[12:53:59] <systemfault> thathurts: So no, you don't need to reset the event delegation every time
[12:54:20] <GoGoGarrett> Thanks for the help though, i'll give it a try and see if I can make it work
[12:54:41] <ryanneufeld> good luck
[13:08:27] <Phil> eh, how can I animate a scroll?
[13:09:04] <Phil> I tried this... $(window).animate({scrollTop:0}, 2000);
[13:09:28] <Phil> but I get a JS error a.ownerDocument is undefined
[13:16:09] <gargoyle-grin> Is there a reason why $('input[type="radio"][value="3"]') doesn't find my <input type="radio" value="3" /> ?
[13:16:29] <gargoyle-grin> It seems to work perfectly if my radio input's value *doesn't* start with a digit.
[13:16:53] <m0dmd> why not just give the radio button an id?
[13:17:05] <m0dmd> or a classname
[13:17:29] <gargoyle-grin> Before I answer that, is there a reason why my example *shouldn't* work?
[13:17:42] <gargoyle-grin> Something that maybe I should have seen in the documentation, for instance?
[13:18:52] <gargoyle-grin> (I'm not the kind of person that would start asking around in #jquery if using an id or class name wouldn't require a fair bit of work.)
[13:19:39] <snover> gargoyle-grin: what browser?
[13:20:01] <gargoyle-grin> Ah.  Didn't think of that.  I'm using UZBL.  It's webkit.
[13:20:14] <snover> what the hell is that?
[13:20:41] <m0dmd> i hope you're the only one using this app in that case
[13:21:07] <chovy> @snover lol
[13:21:13] <gargoyle-grin> Tried it in Firefox.  It seems to be behaving the same way.
[13:21:20] <chovy> It's an Uzbakistani browser.
[13:22:08] <gargoyle-grin> Heh.  No.  Not an Uzbekistani browser.
[13:22:47] <t0nttu> anyone care to comment on this one, is it possible at all: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/loop-animated-change-of-border-image
[13:23:01] <gargoyle-grin> Ah.  Ok.... I'm embarassed now.  I figured out what was going on.  I'm doing something stupid.  Thanks, folks.
[13:24:22] <chovy> http://www.uzbl.org/
[13:25:58] <GoddeR> wonder what was wrong
[13:26:00] <GoddeR> :)
[13:26:26] <chovy> probably '' vs. ""
[13:27:10] <GoddeR> i test his code
[13:27:12] <GoddeR> works fine
[13:27:31] <GoGoGarrett> haha
[13:55:34] <adnasa> hi guys, hope everything is well.
[13:55:35] <adnasa> is there a way for make a  callback after a jQuery.each() ?
[13:55:54] <babonk> It has a callback parameter
[13:56:54] <adnasa> ooops, missed that totally in the documentation. thx babonk!
[13:57:01] <babonk> fsho
[13:57:08] <adnasa> fsho?
[13:57:38] <GoGoGarrett> fo-show (for sure) :]
[13:57:52] <adnasa> I prefer fo shizzle, but.. thx anyhow!
[13:58:29] <GoGoGarrett> Totally got 1 answer under my belt, entirely almost jQuery related as well.
[13:59:06] <juha____> hey woooooooooot
[13:59:31] <babonk> fshooooooo
[14:12:00] <chovy_> $("input[value='3']") seems to work better than $('input[value="3"]');
[14:12:35] <Innocentus> chovy_: what is the difference? performance?
[14:13:15] <chovy_> i think it has something to do with syntax [value='3']
[14:13:29] <chovy_> I may be thinking of css though.
[14:15:48] <gnarf> it shouldn't matter
[14:16:05] <gnarf> chovy: just fyi... "value" might not reflect the actual current value
[14:16:14] <gnarf> but rather what it was stated in the HTML
[14:17:18] <chovy> gnarf: ok
[14:17:30] <gnarf> chovy: http://jsfiddle.net/nzpJN/
[14:19:28] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/bL8UN/
[14:19:30] <chovy> i guess i'm wrong. It seemed to happen on ~='' tests.

[16:23:06] <Confiscative> Hello. I'm having troubles with loading Javascript through Javascript. Before I post my full problem, can somebody please get my assumptions right:
[16:23:49] <Confiscative> Is it possible to let JQuery interpret a script tag that nested in a div?
[16:24:13] <Confiscative> Such as <div><div><script>...</script></div></div>
[16:24:29] <tehopeologist> hey all, i was wondering if someone could help me tweak this random image loader plugin..
[16:25:05] <tehopeologist> http://www.xecorporation.net/vision360/who-we-are
[16:25:35] <tehopeologist> the original plugin script loaded the array, then put the random image in a <img src> tag
[16:25:43] <tehopeologist> i need the random image to apply to the css bgimage
[16:25:51] <tehopeologist> i need to appendTo*
[16:26:37] <tehopeologist> anyone have an idea what i should do?
[16:27:26] <Confiscative> Sorry. My question was utterly broken: I'm trying to load Javascript through a JQuery UI dialog. Will the <script> tag be interpreted if it is nested inside divs?
[16:27:45] <erichynds> Confiscative are you inserting the div that contains the script tags?
[16:31:50] <Confiscative> erichynds: I'm doing a $.ajax() with dataType set to 'html'. I'm then catching the 'success' event. With the data that is passed to that event, I do: $('body').append(data);
[16:32:04] <erichynds> then yes, the javascript within the script tag will fire
[16:33:03] <Confiscative> Oh, I first do data.hide(); I assume that doesn't change anything. Will using data.dialog() interfere with anything too?
[16:33:16] <erichynds> it shouldn't, no
[16:34:19] <Confiscative> The offending code does load when I directly append it to an existing element, but fails to interpret when I load it inside a bunch of divs.
[16:35:00] <erichynds> what do you mean load it inside a bunch of divs?
[16:35:19] <Confiscative> As in: <div><div><script>...</script></div></div>
[16:35:38] <Confiscative> Comparingly, a Javascript include tag doesn't work either when it is inside the dialog div.
[16:36:10] <erichynds> so you're $.ajax'ing data into a dialog div, then calling dialog() on the div?
[16:36:51] <v_> Hello all, hopefully easy question: I'm doing a get(...function(data){...}); call where data is a set of divs with unique ids, and I need to select each div individually within data. Is there an easy way? (like $(data).$(div#something).html(), but working)
[16:37:05] <Confiscative> No. I'm getting an entire dialog div through $.ajax. Inside that div is a <script> tag. I'm then calling .dialog() on that div.
[16:37:11] <erichynds> ah ha
[16:37:50] <erichynds> well, the script tags should execute before the dialog widget gets involved.
[16:38:08] <erichynds> as long as the html is actually in the DOM
[16:42:23] <tehopeologist> can someone help me with this random background-image script?
[16:42:52] <tehopeologist> i've tried googling different ones, but they all add an <img src> inside the div, i just want the background-image of the div to randomize
[16:47:23] <tehopeologist> meow?
[16:51:27] <m0dmd> ruff?
[16:56:01] <GoGoGarrett> roar?
[16:59:49] <duckspeaker> roar confirmed
[17:00:20] <tehopeologist> :(
[17:00:28] <tehopeologist> no one wants to help me, so i meow in frustration
[17:00:32] <tehopeologist> as opposed to raging
[17:00:32] <tehopeologist> >_<
[17:02:00] <duckspeaker> tehopeologist: randomly select from a list of images and set that one as background image of a div?
[17:02:25] <tehopeologist> yes'm
[17:02:26] <tehopeologist> ^_^
[17:02:45] <tehopeologist> i need it to replace the bgimage
[17:02:51] <duckspeaker> $('#divID').css("background-image", "url(/myimage.jpg)");
[17:02:54] <tehopeologist> not put the random image in an img tag
[17:02:54] <duckspeaker> like that?
[17:03:00] <tehopeologist> yes
[17:03:10] <tehopeologist> and i have a folder with 6 images i want it to choose from
[17:03:56] <duckspeaker> put the filepaths in an array
[17:04:01] <GoGoGarrett> getRandom(1,6)?
[17:04:05] <duckspeaker> and use Math.random() to pick one in the array
[17:04:07] <tehopeologist> so every time someone reloads the page a random one is chosen as the bgimage
[17:04:48] <tehopeologist> i was doing this:
[17:04:49] <tehopeologist> var images = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg', 'image4.jpg', 'image5.jpg'];
[17:04:55] <tehopeologist> $('#header').css({'background-image': 'url(images/' + images[Math.floor(Math.random() * images.length)] + ')'});
[17:04:57] <duckspeaker> Math.random() * array.length
[17:05:00] <tehopeologist> $('<img src="images/' + images[Math.floor(Math.random() * images.length)] + '">').appendTo('#ad');
[17:05:05] <tehopeologist> but like you see
[17:05:11] <tehopeologist> that script puts it in an img tag
[17:05:16] <tehopeologist> and doesn't replace the bgimage
[17:05:25] <duckspeaker> well i just gave you the line to not put it in an img
[17:05:52] <tehopeologist> ah
[17:05:53] <tehopeologist> ok
[17:05:56] <prusajr> Hello guys
[17:05:58] <tehopeologist> so replace images with array
[17:05:59] <tehopeologist> ?
[17:06:40] <duckspeaker> replace /myimage.jpg with the random image path
[17:07:11] <tehopeologist> one sec
[17:07:15] <tehopeologist> making some adjustments
[17:07:27] <duckspeaker> $('#divID').css("background-image", "url(images[Math.floor(Math.random() * images.length])")
[17:07:40] <duckspeaker> might need to do string interpolation in the url though
[17:08:02] <pandeiro> anyone work with the jquery form plugin? what is the point of using an iframe for ajax file uploads?
[17:09:24] <tehopeologist> this is what i have so far

I have to run this jquery code after all checkboxes, if not, jQuery cant find any of th

[17:11:35] <duckspeaker> tehopeologist: looks ok. does it work?

[17:14:22] <tehopeologist> i feel like it should work
[17:14:27] <tehopeologist> but it's not even loading one image
[17:14:35] <tehopeologist> let alone random ones every time you refresh the page
[17:16:26] <prusajr> well, here you can see the code http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8967423/thingdoc/thingdoc.html :-)
[17:18:19] <tehopeologist> duckspeaker: any luck?

[17:20:00] <duckspeaker> i just wrote up code that works for me
[17:20:04] <duckspeaker> i'll share it

[17:21:54] <duckspeaker> http://pastebin.com/Yx7vfZQ1
[17:21:57] <duckspeaker> try that test code
[17:22:13] <tehopeologist> kk
[17:22:52] <duckspeaker> you'll have to change the filepath of the image the div initially contains
[17:22:57] <geestring> i know the Date object will return the current time, but how would i make a clock where the time will change in real time? Would I have to put the Date object in a timer or something?
[17:23:28] <tehopeologist> why is there a click function?
[17:23:41] <duckspeaker> tehopeologist: just to test that it works
[17:23:45] <tehopeologist> o
[17:23:46] <tehopeologist> ok
[17:23:51] <duckspeaker> you click on the image to change it to a random image
[17:24:56] <duckspeaker> geestring: use jquery animate()?
[17:25:23] <tehopeologist> damn, it's still not working for me..  any ideas?
[17:25:55] <duckspeaker> are there any errors in your browser?
[17:25:58] <geestring> Oh I just want the time to change, without anything graphical
[17:26:54] <tehopeologist> nope, no error
[17:26:55] <tehopeologist> >_<
[17:26:56] <tehopeologist> wtfff
[17:27:12] <sunscreen> FUckinG Mosquito
[17:27:26] <sunscreen> I WILL CRACK ITS SKULL IN
[17:27:47] <sunscreen> FUCKING GAY INSECT
[17:28:27] <duckspeaker> geestring: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6084051/how-to-periodically-update-a-date-time-value-on-a-page-using-jquery
[17:28:29] <sunscreen> I have had to sufferer it wounds
[17:28:30] <duckspeaker> like that?
[17:28:31] <sunscreen> 23@#$@#
[17:28:47] <tehopeologist> what's crazy
[17:28:50] <tehopeologist> is it IS working
[17:28:54] <tehopeologist> sortof
[17:28:57] <tehopeologist> look at this
[17:29:02] <tehopeologist> <div id="slider_container2" style="background-image: url("images/sliderbgs/bgimg3.jpg");">
[17:29:06] <tehopeologist> that's what it's outputting
[17:29:23] <duckspeaker> you have nested double quotes
[17:29:36] <tehopeologist> ah
[17:29:36] <thathurts> background-image: url('images/sliderbgs/bgimg3.jpg')
[17:29:38] <tehopeologist> sec
[17:29:39] <tehopeologist> yeah
[17:29:43] <duckspeaker> 'background-image: url("images/sliderbgs/bgimg3.jpg");'
[17:29:44] <duckspeaker> try that
[17:29:50] <thathurts> nooooo
[17:29:59] <thathurts> don't make the main attribute apostrophes
[17:30:01] <thathurts> i hate that crap
[17:30:07] <duckspeaker> alright alright
[17:30:16] <thathurts> technically css doesn't even need quotes for that
[17:30:22] <thathurts> background-image: url(images/sliderbgs/bgimg3.jpg)
[17:30:25] <thathurts> it'll actually take that
[17:30:26] <duckspeaker> i know
[17:31:21] <tehopeologist> thing is
[17:31:26] <tehopeologist> the jQuery is this:
[17:31:26] <tehopeologist> $('#slider_container2').css({'background-image': 'url(images/sliderbgs/' + bgimages[Math.floor(Math.random() * bgimages.length)] + ')'});
[17:31:34] <tehopeologist> so that jquery is making that double nesting
[17:31:43] <tehopeologist> where can i switch the quotes?
[17:32:49] <duckspeaker> you shouldn't need to; that looks fine
[17:33:09] <thathurts> try making it readable
[17:33:14] <thathurts> var imgUrl = "images/sliderbgs/" + bgimages[Math.floor(Math.random() * bgimages.length);$("#slider_container2").css("background-image", "url(imgUrl)";
[17:33:43] <thathurts> var imgUrl = "images/sliderbgs/" + bgimages[Math.floor(Math.random() * bgimages.length);$("#slider_container2").css("background-image", "url(" + imgUrl + ")";
[17:34:32] <thathurts> i think there's a missing brace in there but you get the idea
[17:34:50] <thathurts> var imgUrl = "images/sliderbgs/" + bgimages[Math.floor(Math.random() * bgimages.length)];$("#slider_container2").css("background-image", "url(" + imgUrl + ")";
[17:35:59] <tehopeologist> no dice thathurts
[17:36:02] <tehopeologist> >_<
[17:36:08] <thathurts> what?
[17:36:13] <tehopeologist> http://xecorporation.net/vision360/explore/who-we-are
[17:36:15] <thathurts> what's the error?
[17:36:16] <tehopeologist> check for yourself
[17:36:17] <tehopeologist> lol
[17:36:30] <tehopeologist> oh
[17:36:30] <tehopeologist> wait
[17:36:33] <thathurts> what do i click to trigger it?
[17:36:33] <tehopeologist> i know what it might be
[17:36:34] <tehopeologist> sec
[17:36:37] <tehopeologist> no clicks
[17:36:40] <tehopeologist> it should auto do it
[17:36:45] <tehopeologist> one sec tho i think i see the error
[17:38:09] <tehopeologist> damn
[17:38:14] <tehopeologist> still doing the double quotes
[17:38:16] <tehopeologist> no error tho
[17:38:23] <tehopeologist> refresh the page to see what i'm talkin about
[17:38:43] <thathurts> i don't see what you're talking about
[17:38:46] <thathurts> what am i supposed to be seeing
[17:38:52] <tehopeologist> <div id="slider_container2" style="background-image: url("images/sliderbgs/bgimg3.jpg");">
[17:40:48] <tehopeologist> duckspeaker, am i missing something that's making it do this?
[17:41:24] <thathurts> $("#slider_container2").css("background-image", "url('" + imgUrl + "')");
[17:41:25] <thathurts> try that
[17:42:48] <thathurts> hey
[17:42:50] <thathurts> i know what it is
[17:42:52] <tehopeologist> same result
[17:42:52] <thathurts> your url is bad
[17:42:55] <tehopeologist> oh
[17:42:55] <tehopeologist> ?
[17:43:07] <tehopeologist> should i put in the bloginfo template_directory?
[17:43:12] <tehopeologist> i guess?
[17:43:12] <thathurts> hang on
[17:43:58] <tehopeologist> got it
[17:44:02] <tehopeologist> ^_^_^_^
[17:44:12] <tehopeologist> i guess i did have to put the php in the jquery
[17:44:19] <tehopeologist> i thought it would load like the css would load
[17:44:25] <thathurts> now the url is different
[17:44:44] <tehopeologist> but since it's styling the div instead of putting it in the css randomly i should've done that to begin with
[17:44:51] <tehopeologist> awesome!  thanks for helping me figure that out
[17:44:53] <tehopeologist> ^_^_^_^_^_^
[17:44:55] <tehopeologist> <3333333333
[17:45:03] <GoGoGarrett> ascii love!
[17:45:21] <Brodingo> 8===D
[17:45:23] <GoGoGarrett> glad you got it figured out
[17:45:28] <tehopeologist> lolz
[17:45:40] <tehopeologist> you think there's an easier way to load the images faster?
[17:45:48] <thathurts> i think those images are xbox huge
[17:45:51] <tehopeologist> it seems like the image is the last thing the server loads
[17:45:59] <tehopeologist> it's what the designer wanted =/
[17:46:01] <tehopeologist> i'm just the coder
[17:46:05] <tehopeologist> it's like 1920x598
[17:46:11] <GoGoGarrett> x.x
[17:46:15] <tehopeologist> yeh
[17:46:17] <tehopeologist> whatevz
[17:46:29] <thathurts> if you really want the images to load fast
[17:46:40] <thathurts> what you can do is make them part of the page but hide them
[17:46:48] <thathurts> that way they'll be loaded up front
[17:46:51] <thathurts> but
[17:46:54] <thathurts> that's a lot of overhead
[17:46:55] <duckspeaker> tehopeologist: your url makes me think of xe
[17:46:59] <thathurts> it'll make the initial load really big
[17:47:04] <duckspeaker> formerly known as...blackwater
[17:47:04] <thathurts> man
[17:47:22] <tehopeologist> yeah
[17:47:34] <tehopeologist> i put that script at the very top of my $(function)
[17:47:39] <tehopeologist> it at least loads first
[17:47:41] <thathurts> what is this site? have i been aiding and abetting christianity? ugh
[17:47:42] <tehopeologist> while the other shit loads
[17:47:43] <tehopeologist> lol
[17:47:46] <tehopeologist> ROFL
[17:47:47] <tehopeologist> nonono
[17:47:52] <tehopeologist> i'm a self-employed contractor
[17:47:56] <tehopeologist> this is one of our clients
[17:47:57] <tehopeologist> *shrug*
[17:48:00] <tehopeologist> it pays teh billz
[17:48:02] <tehopeologist> i don't give a shit
[17:48:03] <tehopeologist> rofl
[17:48:25] <thathurts> why don't you just put all that crap in (document).ready?
[17:48:32] <thathurts> that's the soonest you can get it to load
[17:48:34] <tehopeologist> they are?
[17:48:35] <tehopeologist> O_o;;
[17:48:52] <tehopeologist> isn't $(function)  the same as document.ready?
[17:49:03] <thathurts> <script type="text/javascript">
[17:49:03] <thathurts> 		$(document).ready(function(){
[17:49:03] <thathurts> 				$.getpreLoaded();
[17:49:03] <thathurts> 			});
[17:49:03] <thathurts> 	</script>
[17:49:06] <thathurts> you have that already
[17:49:10] <thathurts> why not just put it in there?
[17:49:15] <tehopeologist> that's a plugin
[17:49:22] <tehopeologist> i guess i could add it to the plugin's .js
[17:49:26] <tehopeologist> seems like a pain tho
[17:49:34] <duckspeaker> ?
[17:49:37] <tehopeologist> wordpress
[17:49:50] <duckspeaker> put it in document.ready
[17:49:54] <duckspeaker> not necessarily in getpreLoaded
[17:50:02] <thathurts> right
[17:50:10] <tehopeologist> hm one sec
[17:50:15] <tehopeologist> so just replace the function()
[17:50:20] <tehopeologist> with document.ready?
[17:50:24] <tehopeologist> i thought you can't have 2 of them?
[17:50:39] <thathurts> to fit with the theme of the site
[17:50:40] <thathurts> jesus christ
[17:50:42] <Brodingo> this is pretty messy
[17:50:56] <tehopeologist> LOL
[17:50:56] <duckspeaker> you can do multiple things in document.ready()...
[17:51:00] <tehopeologist> i know that
[17:51:02] <tehopeologist> i'm saying
[17:51:14] <pandeiro> can anyone explain the iframe hack used to submit multipart binary data with the jquery form plugin? ie the why of it
[17:51:15] <tehopeologist> i thought you couldn't do two document.ready's in a page
[17:51:23] <duckspeaker> ...
[17:51:25] <thathurts> http://pastebin.com/GhHnPFFm
[17:51:30] <thathurts> how much are you getting paid again?
[17:51:59] <tehopeologist> i know i can put them in there
[17:52:01] <tehopeologist> what i'm saying is
[17:52:06] <tehopeologist> that preloaded doc.ready
[17:52:11] <tehopeologist> is running from a plugin
[17:52:34] <duckspeaker> i think you're confused about whta doc.ready is
[17:52:47] <thathurts> i think i see what he's saying
[17:52:48] <DoctorDarren> Gentlemen, by any chance would it be common for draggables to go batshit crazy when you try to move them in FF, but work fine in Chrome and IE?
[17:52:53] <thathurts> he really has no control over that
[17:52:59] <thathurts> because the plugin's putting it on the page
[17:53:02] <duckspeaker> then i guess i'm the one who's confused
[17:53:06] <tehopeologist> yeah
[17:53:08] <thathurts> but
[17:53:11] <thathurts> it's still dumb
[17:53:13] <thathurts> and ugly as shit
[17:53:14] <tehopeologist> it auto-puts that on the head
[17:53:17] <tehopeologist> i understand that.
[17:53:25] <tehopeologist> my boss says use wordpress
[17:53:27] <tehopeologist> and i say ok
[17:53:29] <tehopeologist> and i make it work
[17:53:31] <tehopeologist> lol
[17:53:35] <Brodingo> work*
[17:53:36] <tehopeologist> i'll just add it in the plugin's .php
[17:54:05] <thathurts> AHAHAHAH
[17:54:05] <thathurts> dude
[17:54:07] <thathurts> i just looked at it
[17:54:11] <thathurts> that site's homepage is 6.5MB
[17:54:13] <thathurts> hahaha COME ON
[17:54:18] <thathurts> jesus needs a lot of bandwidth apparently
[17:54:18] <duckspeaker> wow
[17:54:37] <GoGoGarrett> html5 buildscript will compress img/scripts/ and jargan
[17:54:49] <tehopeologist> better?
[17:54:52] <duckspeaker> where do you see it's a christian site
[17:55:08] <tehopeologist> the homepage isn't finished..
[17:55:27] <kojiro> so it's gonna get bigger?
[17:55:31] <tehopeologist> man, i wasn't asking to critique my website.  my designer hasn't given me the compressed slider images
[17:55:35] <tehopeologist> so i just used .png placeholders
[17:55:43] <tehopeologist> -_-;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
[17:55:46] <tehopeologist> they're pngs
[17:55:53] <tehopeologist> cuz i'm the only one who's really looking at the site right now
[17:55:59] <thathurts> just an fyi
[17:56:03] <thathurts> i think you should go with webfonts
[17:56:06] <thathurts> instead of images
[17:56:16] <thathurts> you could replace a lot of the art assets on that thing with web fonts
[17:56:18] <thathurts> it'd look the same
[17:56:21] <thathurts> and be a fraction of the size
[17:56:38] <tehopeologist> does google's webfonts have the fonts i need to use?
[17:56:40] <kojiro> if you don't have to use images, don't, and if you do, use sprites ;)
[17:56:43] <tehopeologist> i know using text would be faster
[17:56:53] <tehopeologist> i'm still learning guys.
[17:57:01] <pandeiro> i'm getting to that point where i begin cursing out the entire channel out of frustration with being ignored while everyone talks about bullshit...
[17:57:10] <tehopeologist> no shit
[17:57:13] <pandeiro> don't any of you do ajax file uploads?
[17:57:17] <GoGoGarrett> http://www.fontsquirrel.com/ has a lot of greaet fonts and i think they're furree
[17:57:21] <kojiro> pandeiro: um, I don't :(
[17:57:25] <tehopeologist> i don't feel like a critique of an unfinished site is relevant
[17:57:25] <Nuckin> anyone have a good work around for Safari5's stupid behavior where it won't load Style tags on $.load() calls?  it's the only browser being a problem with this
[17:57:26] <thathurts> yup
[17:57:27] <pandeiro> is this #jquery-design?
[17:57:30] <thathurts> font squirrel is awesome
[17:57:35] <tehopeologist> GoGoGarrett: i know that
[17:57:39] <tehopeologist> i use it if you look in my css
[17:57:44] <GoGoGarrett> :[
[17:57:50] <kojiro> <_<
[17:58:00] <tehopeologist> but some other fonts the designer says we HAVE to use isn't on font-squirrel
[17:58:13] <GoGoGarrett> tell him he's dumb
[17:58:16] <tehopeologist> he is
[17:58:19] <GoGoGarrett> then be like roar!
[17:58:20] <tehopeologist> but he helps me get paid.
[17:58:24] <tehopeologist> i don't give a fuck
[17:58:28] <tehopeologist> as long as i finish the job
[17:58:29] <GoGoGarrett> haha we use Typekit at my job, but they charge
[17:58:33] <tehopeologist> this is a side job for me
[17:58:38] <tehopeologist> exactly
[17:58:41] <thathurts> it sucks because typekit is missing a LOT of fonts
[17:58:41] <tehopeologist> my designer is cheap
[17:58:45] <tehopeologist> he says trim images i say ok
[17:58:49] <tehopeologist> and it gets done
[17:58:57] <tehopeologist> these sites aren't sites i'm going to be frequenting
[17:58:57] <thathurts> typekit doesn't have a big enough library for a commercial service
[17:59:07] <tehopeologist> or anyone else on the internet really for that matter
[17:59:20] <thathurts> dude
[17:59:23] <thathurts> when i went to that url
[17:59:26] <pandeiro> ajax.
[17:59:28] <pandeiro> file.
[17:59:28] <kojiro> tehopeologist: have you read this? http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/webfonts/quick/
[17:59:30] <pandeiro> uploads.
[17:59:35] <thathurts> my penis shrunk at least an additional inch
[17:59:56] <tehopeologist> thank you all for your assistance in helping me fix my random image script
[17:59:59] <tehopeologist> :)
[18:00:00] * kojiro avoids saying something hurtful to thathurts 
[18:00:00] <duckspeaker> np
[18:00:14] <thathurts> kojiro: i'm my own worst critic. don't hold back
[18:00:20] <kojiro> thank you for being a bot, dspeaker
[18:00:25] <tehopeologist> duckspeaker: at least you helped me solve the problem, not try to be a design fuck
[18:00:27] <kojiro> bah
[18:00:33] <duckspeaker> kojiro: ?
[18:00:45] <thathurts> tehopeologist: so you're going to insult me after i helped you?
[18:00:50] <kojiro> duckspeaker: didn't look like you had spoken in a while, so I thought I'd test
[18:01:06] <kojiro> man, the channel is in RARE FORM TONIGHT
[18:01:07] <duckspeaker> kojiro: a bot who was trying to help someone?
[18:01:08] <tehopeologist> i feel as though you're insulting me on an unfinished product
[18:01:13] <kojiro> duckspeaker: I just got here
[18:01:16] <duckspeaker> oh
[18:01:17] <tehopeologist> and it's counter-productive
[18:01:34] <duckspeaker> tehopeologist: thathurts just has an abrasive personality :)
[18:01:36] <tehopeologist> i thank you veryvery much for helping me out
[18:01:37] <thathurts> separate yourself from the website. they're not the same. pointing out that a homepage is 6.5MB is not being counter-productive
[18:01:42] <duckspeaker> no need to get bent out of shape
[18:01:51] * kojiro is in the shape of a slightly fat man
[18:01:58] <kojiro> can I get bent *into* shape?
[18:02:01] <GoGoGarrett> Today I managed to populate a image gallery from facebooks api-  I'm a scrub so I felt cool.
[18:02:14] <tehopeologist> well it gets a bit personal when i try to explain that the images that make the homepage 6.5mb are placeholders
[18:02:24] <tehopeologist> and you say your dick shrank
[18:02:29] <tehopeologist> bit hurtful, don't you think?
[18:02:33] <thathurts> are you kidding?
[18:02:39] <thathurts> you can't take a joke?
[18:02:44] <thathurts> you need thicker skin man
[18:02:45] <tehopeologist> i can.
[18:02:46] <tehopeologist> and do
[18:02:47] <tehopeologist> <3
[18:02:49] <tehopeologist> no worries
[18:02:49] <thathurts> http://www.phpletter.com/Demo/AjaxFileUpload-Demo/
[18:02:58] <tehopeologist> thank you bunches all for your help
[18:02:59] <kojiro> tehopeologist: actually, I think "my dick shrank when I looked at that" means "I was intimidated by what I saw"
[18:03:00] <thathurts> and the weiner shrinkage was due to the christian bullcrap
[18:03:03] <thathurts> not the file size
[18:03:10] <tehopeologist> kojiro: luhlz
[18:03:16] <tehopeologist> ah
[18:03:20] <tehopeologist> my mistake entirely
[18:03:21] <tehopeologist> see
[18:03:27] <tehopeologist> miscommunication leads to assumptions
[18:03:30] <tehopeologist> and that's my fault
[18:03:32] <tehopeologist> i <3 you
[18:03:34] <tehopeologist> :)
[18:03:35] <kojiro> heh
[18:03:42] <tehopeologist> thanks man for real tho.
[18:03:43] <kojiro> RARE FORM
[18:03:49] <thathurts> when people are talking about weiners shrinking in freenode #Jquery, i really don't understand how anyone could take it serously
[18:04:01] <tehopeologist> can't believe i didn't think to write in that php to send the url to the template directory
[18:04:06] <tehopeologist> lolz
[18:04:12] <kojiro> thathurts: when people are talking about weiners shrinking on #jquery, it's a normal day
[18:04:12] <tehopeologist> i guess i'm still a little new to the channel
[18:04:13] <Brodingo> yeah #jquery makes me wiener grow
[18:04:20] <tehopeologist> only been on here a couple times in the past month

[18:05:01] <thathurts> http://www.phpletter.com/Demo/AjaxFileUpload-Demo/
[18:05:11] <kojiro> jquery gives me something to play with besides my ... fonts
[18:08:37] <tehopeologist> hey thathurts: i just updated the slider images on the homepage, can you see how big the homepage is now?  i'm not sure how to check that
[18:08:42] <tehopeologist> i'm curious now
[18:08:42] <tehopeologist> lol
[18:08:46] <thathurts> do you have firebug?
[18:09:00] <tehopeologist> mmhmm
[18:09:13] <thathurts> go into the net panel
[18:09:15] <Jakey> yes i od
[18:09:15] <thathurts> select "All"
[18:09:18] <thathurts> and refresh the page
[18:09:23] <thathurts> at the bottom you'll see all the requests
[18:09:27] <thathurts> and how big the page is
[18:09:30] <thathurts> it's 3.1MB now
[18:10:00] <thathurts> which is still somewhere between the size of an xbox 1 gamepad and andre the giant
[18:10:13] <tehopeologist> mint's saying 2.8
[18:10:14] <tehopeologist> either way
[18:10:18] <tehopeologist> a lot better than before
[18:10:21] <tehopeologist> that's not HORRIBLE
[18:10:30] <thathurts> it's saying 2.8 from cache right?
[18:10:32] <tehopeologist> considering i don't have a font-face for the font the designer wants to use
[18:10:35] <thathurts> the actual size for me is 3.3
[18:10:37] <tehopeologist> no
[18:10:41] <tehopeologist> i cleared cache
[18:10:50] <tehopeologist> 137 requests 2.8MB
[18:10:59] <thathurts> weird i get 142 requests
[18:11:02] <tehopeologist> hm
[18:11:05] <tehopeologist> eh
[18:11:06] <tehopeologist> either way
[18:11:09] <tehopeologist> i'm ok with it
[18:11:12] <tehopeologist> if they don't like it
[18:11:17] <tehopeologist> they're going to have to sacrifice something
[18:11:20] <tehopeologist> the font
[18:11:25] <tehopeologist> or the quality of the images loading
[18:11:29] <thathurts> you could probably get a lot more mileage out of the images
[18:11:33] <thathurts> by compressing them at a 70% ratio
[18:11:37] <thathurts> they'd look almost identical
[18:11:39] <tehopeologist> yeh, they're all pngs
[18:11:40] <thathurts> and be a lot smaller
[18:11:57] <tehopeologist> can you do quality adjustments with pngs?
[18:12:07] <tehopeologist> and still keep transparency?
[18:12:08] <GoGoGarrett> I'm telling ya, theres an automated build script that comes with the html5 boilerplate that can do some srs damage to file sizes
[18:12:15] <thathurts> if you need transparency just make them gifs
[18:12:23] <tehopeologist> oh really?
[18:12:31] <tehopeologist> i always thought png was the better decision
[18:12:42] <kojiro> wtf, png transparency is FINE
[18:12:47] <tehopeologist> lolz
[18:12:49] <thathurts> depends on what the content of the image is
[18:13:14] <GoGoGarrett> photoshop - save for web and devices - select the format you want, bottom left shows you the kb/s and how long it'll take to load on 56k modem
[18:13:20] <tehopeologist> yeh
[18:13:26] <tehopeologist> that's what i do
[18:13:36] <GoGoGarrett> but for png's idk if theres a way to reduce quality withouta 3rd party tool
[18:13:49] <tehopeologist> *shrug*
[18:13:51] <tehopeologist> it's all good
[18:13:54] <thathurts> you can't by definition reduce the quality of a lossly compressed format
[18:13:56] <tehopeologist> i'm just glad it's smaller now
[18:14:03] <tehopeologist> the client will be happy and so will the designer
[18:14:09] <thathurts> but here's the perfect example
[18:14:12] <thathurts> http://xecorporation.net/vision360/wp-content/themes/vision360_2011/images/sidebar_line.png
[18:14:15] <tehopeologist> he was bitching and i kept telling him it's a placeholder till he gives me the final images >_<
[18:14:19] <thathurts> there is no reason that couldn't just be a css border
[18:14:24] <tehopeologist> true
[18:14:29] <kojiro> tehopeologist: don't preoptimize, it'll cost you money. Better someone else's weiner than your wallet ;)
[18:14:50] <tehopeologist> kojiro: elaborate?  i'm not sure i'm following you..
[18:14:53] <GoGoGarrett> http://www.smushit.com/
[18:14:58] <GoGoGarrett> reduces images
[18:15:03] <thathurts> generally speaking you don't need to use images for square or rectangle shapes
[18:15:20] <tehopeologist> yeah, thathurts, i know
[18:15:26] <tehopeologist> it was late++ when i started this site for them
[18:15:31] <kojiro> tehopeologist: follow best practices (like fewer http requests, etc), but don't waste time optimizing individual images until the rest of the work is done.
[18:15:32] <tehopeologist> and i just did whatever i thought at the time
[18:15:37] <tehopeologist> that seemed relevant
[18:15:54] <thathurts> since it's a christian website
[18:15:59] <tehopeologist> word, good tip kojiro, thanks <33
[18:15:59] <thathurts> i'd double the size of all the images
[18:15:59] <tehopeologist> ^_^
[18:16:03] <thathurts> and let them crash and burn
[18:16:03] <tehopeologist> LOLOLOLOL
[18:16:04] <tehopeologist> i would
[18:16:05] <tehopeologist> but
[18:16:07] <tehopeologist> $$$$$
[18:16:08] <tehopeologist> lol
[18:16:16] <tehopeologist> i'm beginning to love this channel.
[18:16:17] <tehopeologist> :)
[18:16:26] <thathurts> in fact
[18:16:28] <kojiro> thathurts: yeah, kill all the nonprofits!
[18:16:31] <thathurts> since it's a christian site
[18:16:37] <thathurts> i'd just alt printscreen that crap
[18:16:41] <thathurts> and make it one png
[18:16:44] <thathurts> with an anchor around it
[18:16:46] <thathurts> that goes to goatse.cx
[18:16:57] <tehopeologist> ROFLROFLROFLROFLROFL
[18:17:03] <tehopeologist> it's funny you say one image
[18:17:08] <thathurts> oh god
[18:17:09] <thathurts> don't tell me
[18:17:16] <tehopeologist> my designer actually suggested that for some of the pages
[18:17:16] <thathurts> it was going to be some image map nightmare
[18:17:17] <tehopeologist> i'm like
[18:17:24] <tehopeologist> areyoufuckingkiddingme
[18:17:25] <tehopeologist> -_-;;;;;;;;;;;
[18:17:33] <kojiro> one image == fewer http requests. fewer http requests == automatically better!
[18:17:37] <tehopeologist> LOL
[18:17:39] <tehopeologist> exactlyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
[18:17:40] <tehopeologist> :D
[18:17:40] <sterna> quiet please, i'm trying to think!
[18:17:52] <GoGoGarrett> lol
[18:18:00] <thathurts> i seriously wouldn't have taken that job
[18:18:07] <thathurts> i wouldn't do a christian website
[18:18:37] <GoGoGarrett> Moneys money
[18:18:47] <kojiro> thathurts: dude, you appear to have a chip on your shoulder about a specific religion...
[18:18:59] <thathurts> i wouldn't do a hindu website either
[18:19:03] <tehopeologist> *shrug*
[18:19:14] <tehopeologist> i get paid pretty good for being in college coding
[18:19:17] <tehopeologist> since it's my career
[18:19:26] <tehopeologist> doesn't really matter what i make
[18:19:32] <tehopeologist> as long as i get better each time
[18:19:33] <tehopeologist> :)
[18:19:42] <kojiro> not sure why all the hate for religion, but anyway, it's pretty far OT
[18:19:43] <thathurts> i care about the content of what i make
[18:19:50] <kojiro> let's get back to shrunken ... images
[18:20:03] <GoGoGarrett> haha
[18:23:41] <tehopeologist> lolz
[18:26:09] <orolo> thathurts: did you make http://goatse.cx/?
[18:27:26] <chrislabeard> is there a way in jquery to set an objects background as transparent ?
[18:27:49] <orolo> chrislabeard: ?css
[18:27:55] <chrislabeard> doesn't work
[18:28:05] <chrislabeard> I can't figure out how to get jwplayer to have a black background
[18:28:13] <chrislabeard> I'm using jquery to embed it
[18:28:21] <orolo> something like $('object').css({'background-color': transparent});
[18:28:28] <orolo> oh.
[18:28:51] <orolo> chrislabeard: what's jwplater?
[18:28:54] <Brodingo> .css() should be a last resort
[18:29:02] <chrislabeard> jwplayer
[18:29:15] <orolo> ?jwplayer
[18:29:18] <Brodingo> just because it gets added with jquery doesnt mean the styles shouldnt go in your css file
[18:29:21] <bot-t> orolo, jwPlayer API Plugin | jQuery Plugins - This plugin is to interface the new JWPlayer Javascript API via jQuery object. Since the jwplayer object already supports chaining, this is a super simple plugin. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jwPlayer-api
[18:29:47] <thathurts> <chrislabeard> is there a way in jquery to set an objects background as transparent ?
[18:29:49] <thathurts> wtf?
[18:29:58] <chrislabeard> I'm using jquery to embed it
[18:30:08] <chrislabeard> If you don't know just say no
[18:30:27] <orolo> i have no idea.
[18:30:33] <chrislabeard> idea*
[18:30:35] <orolo> are you trying to extend the options?
[18:31:26] <chrislabeard> I just want the player to have a transparent background, and since its using jquery I thought someone in here might have had experience with it.
[18:31:37] <thathurts> i don't understand why its background isn't transparent by default
[18:31:44] <thathurts> transparent is the default value of any container
[18:31:58] <thathurts> can't you just add some css that overrides whatever style it has?
[18:32:18] <thathurts> you can set #whatever { background-color: transparent } in a css file
[18:32:31] <chrislabeard> I've tried that doesn't seem to work I'll keep digging around
[18:32:40] <thathurts> do you have a url we can go to
[18:32:43] <thathurts> to see what you're talking about?
[18:32:47] <orolo> try to do it in firebug.
[18:32:56] <orolo> or try this: irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/#whatever { background-color: transparent  !important}
[18:32:59] <thathurts> i bet that it's setting the style inline
[18:33:14] <chrislabeard> yeah just a second
[18:35:46] <chrislabeard> It uses jquery to embed it and then spits out an object http://the-artillery.net/content/contact-us
[18:35:56] <chrislabeard> player under "the artillery"
[18:36:04] <thathurts> oh because it's a flash player
[18:36:05] <thathurts> that's why
[18:36:22] <chrislabeard> thats where I'm confused though
[18:36:25] <chrislabeard> it uses jquery to embed the player
[18:36:29] <chrislabeard> but spits out a flash player
[18:36:38] <thathurts> all it's doing it's writing <object> and <embed> tags
[18:36:55] <thathurts> that has nothing to do with however they designed the UI in flash
[18:37:28] <thathurts> you'd have to change the art assets in the flash player
[18:37:34] <chrislabeard> yeah well they are all pngs
[18:37:40] <thathurts> or get a different player
[18:37:43] <chrislabeard> so i went in and modified the opacity of them all
[18:37:58] <chrislabeard> do you know of a minimal player that works with xml?
[18:38:00] <thathurts> why not just use a JS audio player?
[18:38:26] <thathurts> wait
[18:38:27] <thathurts> 'skin': 'http://the-artillery.net/epk/modieus_blue.zip'
[18:38:28] <chrislabeard> I was gonna use that but couldn't find the documentation on using playlist
[18:38:30] <thathurts> why can't you just change the skin?
[18:38:35] <chrislabeard> I did change the skin
[18:38:42] <chrislabeard> but the object tag
[18:38:44] <chrislabeard> has a background on it
[18:38:49] <chrislabeard> that I don't know how to get rid of
[18:39:06] <chrislabeard> bgcoor="#000000"
[18:39:08] <chrislabeard> bgcolor*
[18:39:10] <babonk> I want to disable the page while a progress bar dialogue shows.. Suggested ways of doing this?
[18:39:11] <orolo> the background png in the 'display' folder is the black gradient.
[18:39:39] <thathurts> changing bgcolor isn't goign to change the way it looks
[18:39:50] <chrislabeard> dammit
[18:39:51] <chrislabeard> haha
[18:39:52] <thathurts> unless you change the images in the skin too
[18:40:01] <chrislabeard> yeah, I modified the skin
[18:40:04] <chrislabeard> but didn't change the bg
[18:40:52] <thathurts> $("#mediaplayer").removeAttr("bgcolor");
[18:40:54] <thathurts> you can try that
[18:41:01] <orolo> and next time, instead of asking questions, i'll just say that  i don't know.
[18:41:15] <chrislabeard> k let me try that
[18:41:43] <thathurts> man
[18:41:51] <thathurts> what kind of ghetto player is using bgcolor in 2011?
[18:42:02] <chrislabeard> lol
[18:43:04] <chrislabeard> k that removed the bg color but its still black argg
[18:43:41] <thathurts> like i said
[18:43:45] <thathurts> it's black because of the images
[18:43:48] <thathurts> in the skin
[18:43:58] <thathurts> just try deleting all the background images in the skin
[18:43:59] <thathurts> see what happens
[18:44:13] <chrislabeard> k
[18:44:21] <chrislabeard> does the wmode need to be set to transparent too?
[18:44:31] <thathurts> yeah set it as opaque
[18:44:44] <thathurts> but i don't think that's it
[18:44:48] <thathurts> because it's solid black right?
[18:45:13] <thathurts> set itopaque on both the embed and object tags
[18:45:25] <chrislabeard> k
[18:47:13] <chrislabeard> weird I went in and deleted all the backgrounds still looks like the same, should just be solid black now
[18:47:51] <chrislabeard> oh well I'll keep screwing with it don't need to take anymore of yalls time
[18:47:53] <chrislabeard> thanks for your help
[18:51:56] <sarmiena_> Is there a way to achieve a before submit callback?
[18:53:26] <GoGoGarrett> I'm a scrub, but could you return false on the origional function, and call subit in your callback :s
[18:54:26] <orolo> what's terse way of saying "if index === 0, var - Element" in a .each(function (index, Element) loop?
[18:54:40] <orolo> (var = Element)
[18:54:45] <sarmiena_> i'm trying to assume that i don't know what the actual submit() function will be executing. but i want to guarantee that a piece of code will always run before submit()
[18:54:50] <dismist> nigga said terse
[19:10:45] <Nuckin> anyone know how to append with a load instead of having the load replace everything?  I'd use $.get but I'm not loading an entire page, just its styles
[19:20:37] <thathurts> Nuckin: can you be more specific about what you want to do?
[19:21:48] <markss> or open a question
[19:21:51] <markss> on stackoverflow.com
[19:22:46] <Nuckin> thathurts: I want to load $('whatever').load("buttons.html style") but instead of replacing the contents of $('whatever'), append to it, I know it can be done with $.get sort of but i can't use the tag selector in the url of $.get
[19:23:28] <orolo> Nuckin: could you load it to a hidden div and append that? (i've never tried this)
[19:24:00] <Nuckin> orolo: I could but that seems like the dirty way to do it
[19:24:07] <orolo> haha. true.
[19:25:21] <Nuckin> I would just load the entire HTML file and let inline styles do their thing, but Safari is a Piece of ... well you know and doesn't load inline styles
[19:25:24] <thathurts> Nuckin: can't you just dynamically create teh buttons in javascript?
[19:25:38] <thathurts> and then do a straight append()
[19:26:04] <zpoley> hey guys, anyone have any suggestions for best jQuery grid or table plugins? preferably that integrate with rails
[19:26:50] <Nuckin> thathurts: I could for the buttons, but not for the rest of the pages that need this done, my client knows jack about javascript so I'm setting it up so all they need to do is edit HTML/CSS pages
[19:28:07] <jstr> zpoley: have you tried datatables? http://www.datatables.net/
[19:28:33] <thathurts> Nuckin: http://pastebin.com/hrRK4Sjk
[19:29:03] <thathurts> ignore extra quotation marks
[19:29:13] <Nuckin> thathurts: there's no selector code though
[19:29:30] <zpoley> jstr: yeah i was checking that out - only looked at it
[19:29:39] <zpoley> jstr: have you used it?
[19:29:40] <Nuckin> thathurts: that would load the entire page, I'm trying to get just the <style> tags out of it
[19:29:46] <primepie> anyone knows how I can detect what can modified in an undo event in textarea?
[19:30:10] <jstr> zpoley: a project I'm working on does and it seems to work great. Haven't done much with it personally though.
[19:30:39] <zpoley> jstr: cool - thanks!
[19:30:48] <jstr> zpoley: no worries
[19:32:53] <Nuckin> well after pouring through the $().load() source code, the dirty hidden div was the right way to do it
[19:33:50] <thathurts> Nuckin: i wonder if this would work: http://pastebin.com/29bee5zx
[19:33:54] <orolo> yay dirtballs!
[19:35:06] <Nuckin> thathurts: looks like it might, i'll give it a shot.  If it works you might wanna push a rewrite of the load function to jquery lol
[19:38:19] <GoGoGarrett> What are some good books/sites on jQuery
[19:38:39] <Nuckin> thathurts: type error, getElementsByTagName was executed on the raw text of the HTML file $.get got

[19:49:22] <abjorn> fris: it doesn't work with http either
[19:49:30] <abjorn> and I can use curl with https on this machine
[19:51:21] <Nuckin> thathurts: no errors, but no result either

[19:52:05] <bot-t> djQuery, Menu Jquery Css Scrolling Down | jQuery Menu - http://jquerymenuexamples.com/menu-jquery-css-scrolling-down.html
[19:52:14] <abjorn> hm, maybe so, coldhead, I'll try it
[19:52:15] <Nuckin> thathurts: i think $(data) isn't going to return any result since data is the string contents of buttons.html
[19:53:06] <coldhead> ?ui.accordion
[19:53:07] <bot-t> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[19:53:33] <coldhead> fris: he's on centos, see the link he posted above
[19:53:49] <fris> why not use yum then? git is available through it
[19:54:05] <abjorn> Like I said, it isn't
[19:54:13] <coldhead> he claims it isn't >:\
[19:54:14] <abjorn> isn't in the rpm repos for whatever reason
[19:54:16] <abjorn> :(
[19:54:19] <fris> yum install git-core
[19:54:27] <abjorn> tried that too
[19:54:37] <abjorn> im using the default repos for centos >=/
[19:54:44] <Jakey> hey abjorn
[19:54:46] <Jakey> i know you
[19:54:53] <coldhead> can you download the rpm?
[19:54:58] <Jakey> your nick is familiar
[19:55:01] <fris> abjorn maybe this will help http://angry-fly.com/2009/03/installing-git-on-centos-5/
[19:55:09] <thathurts> Nuckin: it works here but i refined it
[19:55:26] <abjorn> fris: that's what I've been reading
[19:55:35] <abjorn> ALRIGHTY COLDHEAD curl-devel did the trick
[19:55:37] <abjorn> sort of.
[19:55:45] <abjorn> except not git is bitching about github's ssl cert
[19:55:55] <abjorn> *now
[19:56:03] <thathurts> Nuckin: http://pastebin.com/TGJeazjK
[19:56:16] <fris> think you can pass a parameter to ignore the ssl cert warning
[19:56:20] <abjorn> yeah i think so
[19:56:24] <abjorn> in curl it's -k
[19:56:38] <coldhead> gross
[19:56:50] <fris> ive never really used git, other than installing it on this machine, i mainly use svn
[19:57:00] <coldhead> get with the future, bro
[19:57:00] <thathurts> Nuckin: wait one fix
[19:57:02] <abjorn> although I guess not in git
[19:57:12] <abjorn> ew svn
[19:57:18] <thathurts> Nuckin: this does it http://pastebin.com/G1P5E6rR
[19:57:24] <abjorn> using svn is like pulling teeth
[19:57:42] <fris> i guess i should switch from google code to github one day
[19:57:56] <abjorn> well, you can at least use mercurial with google code
[19:58:01] <abjorn> mercurial is like git but not
[19:58:25] <sarmiena_> how do you add additional methods to a jquery element?
[19:58:26] <jonathansampson> ?js " \t\r\n" == 0;
[19:58:29] <bot-t> jonathansampson: true
[19:58:43] <jonathansampson> Nice...
[19:58:49] <abjorn> sarmiena_: as in plugins?
[19:58:52] <abjorn> ?fn
[19:58:54] <bot-t> abjorn, Plugins/Authoring - jQuery offers a mechanism for adding in methods and functionality, bundled as plugins. Most of the methods and functions included in the default download are written using the jQuery plugin construct. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[19:59:22] <coldhead> mercurial is very nice
[19:59:43] <sarmiena_> abjorn: not sure if i need a plugin at this point. i just need to add a method
[20:00:39] <abjorn> well it's the same either way
[20:00:45] <sarmiena_> so I can do something like $('input').someMethod('foo')
[20:00:48] <abjorn> $.fn.method = function (args...) { };
[20:00:58] <sarmiena_> oh i see
[20:00:59] <thathurts> Nuckin: you get it working? http://pastebin.com/G1P5E6rR works perfectly for me
[20:01:21] <sarmiena_> thanks
[20:03:17] <Nuckin> thathurts: nope, just an empty <style></style>
[20:03:39] <thathurts> Nuckin: are you sure that your buttons.html has <style></style> in it?
[20:03:52] <coldhead> sarmiena_: you probably want to conform to the jQUery plugin pattern so your method is chainable -- $('input').someMethod('foo').fadeOut() should still work etc
[20:04:09] <sarmiena_> coldhead: yeah i'm reading about plugins right now.
[20:04:18] <Nuckin> thathurts: lol yea, what browser/environment are you using?
[20:04:24] <thathurts> Nuckin: ff4
[20:05:00] <thathurts> Nuckin: oh...i see what you mean...it's empty in ie9 for me too
[20:05:36] <Nuckin> thathurts: its empty in my ff4, chrome, opera, and safari
[20:06:08] <thathurts> hmmm i wonder why i can see it in ff4
[20:07:06] <thathurts> Nuckin: ugh i see the problem. different browsers return different shit from .get()
[20:07:53] <Nuckin> thathurts: idk, are you loading it through just Open file? or running through apache?
[20:08:08] <thathurts> Nuckin: just opening the file
[20:08:23] <Nuckin> thathurts: thats prolly why
[20:08:57] <Nuckin> thathurts: i have it hosted through apache because my system is a pain with XSS protection, so i can't ajax load files like that
[20:09:28] <thathurts> Nuckin: hmm if you can't use .get() or .ajax() how are you going to load it?
[20:09:54] <Nuckin> thathurts: it works through apache, NOT through open file
[20:10:14] <abjorn> coldhead: I think this VPS will be the death of me.
[20:11:52] <orangjuicecup> hello
[20:12:15] <coldhead> why torture yourself, abjorn
[20:12:47] <abjorn> I have node installed yet the npm installation seems to think it's not
[20:13:01] <abjorn> so brb killing myself and taking linus torvalds with me
[20:13:30] <coldhead> you can hardly blame linus for any of that
[20:13:34] <coldhead> dude just does the kernel
[20:13:36] <coldhead> and git
[20:13:48] <coldhead> he probably thinks javascript is a lite version of java
[20:13:49] <abjorn> I don't care! Taking him with me!
[20:13:52] <abjorn> rofl
[20:14:04] <abjorn> *sigh* just like everyone else
[20:14:10] <coldhead> well i suppose he had a rich and full life
[20:14:16] <abjorn> lol
[20:14:34] <abjorn> I mean, seriously NPM, node is in fucking /usr/bin, how can you not find it in the PATH?
[20:16:14] <abjorn> whatever, ended up installing npm from source
[20:16:20] <sdio> lulwut
[20:16:44] <abjorn> sorry, im off topic like always :p
[20:16:50] <sdio> lulz.
[20:16:57] <sdio> bbq?
[20:17:08] <coldhead> note that no one is complaining
[20:17:08] <sdio> isn't there a #nodejs?
[20:17:13] <abjorn> wow I look to the right of my pastebin paste and I see "Charizard Rape Story" what in the fuck
[20:17:22] <sdio> coldhead: I complain!
[20:17:36] <sdio> Who to complain to?
[20:17:38] <sdio> I must be knowing
[20:17:56] <coldhead> pm bot-t with your gomblaints
[20:18:03] <coldhead> he is very interested in your messages
[20:18:05] <sdio> kk
[20:18:15] <sdio> why /pm not work? :(
[20:18:25] <coldhead> try /query
[20:18:33] <coldhead> or possibly /queery
[20:18:34] <abjorn> bot-t++
[20:18:34] <sdio> but you say pm!
[20:18:42] <sdio> query not pm
[20:18:43] <sdio> query query
[20:18:45] <sdio> pm pm
[20:19:00] <sdio> fuck it, not near as hilarious as I thought.
[20:19:49] <coldhead> this rape story is not good
[20:19:53] <abjorn> xD
[20:19:57] <markss> which IDE is you favourite?
[20:19:59] <markss> for windows?
[20:20:03] <abjorn> Notepad++
[20:20:06] <coldhead> emacs
[20:20:09] <abjorn> well, it's not exactly an IDE
[20:20:14] <sdio> real JS coders just use debug.
[20:20:19] <coldhead> the real time self documenting lisp extensible text editor
[20:20:26] <GoGoGarrett> Vim
[20:20:27] <abjorn> meh I just cannot get the hang of console-based editors like emacs and vim
[20:20:33] <markss> i think an IDE is very required
[20:20:40] <markss> notepad++ just a waste of time
[20:20:42] <coldhead> what do you use on your server, abjorn ?
[20:20:43] <abjorn> Notepad++ is all I need
[20:20:46] <coldhead> nano?
[20:20:48] <abjorn> coldhead: vi lol
[20:20:51] <sdio> wtf? nano?
[20:20:54] <abjorn> I don't like to, but when I have to I use vi
[20:20:56] <sdio> fucking kids these days
[20:21:10] <coldhead> markss: if you really want an ide maybe aptana
[20:21:13] <markss> no no
[20:21:17] <markss> i use turbo c+ for js
[20:21:18] <markss> lol
[20:21:20] <abjorn> komodo is good
[20:21:34] <systemfault> Real JS coders understand that no good IDE exist for their language...
[20:21:35] <markss> i look advanced code complation
[20:21:42] <systemfault> And just use a good editor.
[20:21:56] <systemfault> Forget advanced code completion for JS, doesn't exists.
[20:21:57] <Jakey> systemfault, thats same for any language actually :)
[20:22:03] <markss> systemfault
[20:22:05] <abjorn> If you're willing to spend a little bit of money WebStorm is by far the best web IDE around. By a very wide margin. It's on sale right now for $35 :o
[20:22:06] <markss> try phpstorm
[20:22:06] <GoGoGarrett> you can make Vim an ide if  youneed auto completion, but vim is so much quicker than any other editior
[20:22:08] <systemfault> The best I've seen is webstorm
[20:22:12] <abjorn> ya
[20:22:13] <abjorn> webstorm
[20:22:13] <systemfault> And it's still not perect
[20:22:14] <abjorn> fuck year
[20:22:14] <markss> ahah lol
[20:22:15] <abjorn> hivemind
[20:22:16] <systemfault> *perfect
[20:22:19] <markss> lol
[20:22:21] <abjorn> HIVEMIND
[20:22:23] <markss> phpstorm == webstorm
[20:22:27] <markss> but have some indent bugs
[20:22:28] <systemfault> Yeah, indeed.
[20:22:31] <coldhead> people asking about text editors are like barbarians wandering around the countryside. and they say "where should i go?" and you say "to rome!" and they say "no i'll just go to this little town here" but eventually they all go to rome and they should have done so sooner
[20:22:38] <abjorn> except webstorm is cheaper right now
[20:22:41] <systemfault> So.. I still use vim :/
[20:22:48] <coldhead> also emacs == rome
[20:22:52] <markss> actually
[20:22:55] <markss> beta is always free
[20:22:56] <markss> for phpstorm
[20:23:00] <thathurts> coldhead: notepad++ actually
[20:23:16] <Jakey> but code completion is nice
[20:23:22] <markss> phpstorm provides really good  code completion
[20:23:22] <coldhead> puhlease
[20:23:26] <markss> not just for jquery
[20:23:27] <Jakey> dreamweaver has a jquery code completion
[20:23:27] <abjorn> wow coldhead, as soon as I saw "helpless Clefairy" I stopped reading
[20:23:30] <Jakey> very nice
[20:23:31] <abjorn> this story is taking a turn for the worst
[20:23:33] <GoGoGarrett> You can make Vim have code-completion
[20:23:48] <markss> dw sucks completely
[20:23:50] <GoGoGarrett> but the moment is untouchable in terms of productivty
[20:23:50] <markss> the worst
[20:23:57] <coldhead> abjorn: "tiny balloon knot" will haunt me
[20:24:01] <systemfault> DW is the best to create a bad programmer.
[20:24:01] <Jakey> how its suck markss?
[20:24:09] <Jakey> you never use it
[20:24:10] <abjorn> LOL coldhead
[20:24:11] <markss> try webstorm
[20:24:16] <abjorn> coldhead: poor gary oak
[20:24:16] <coldhead> code completion is not the droids you are looking for
[20:24:31] <GoGoGarrett> qwerty or dvorak?
[20:24:40] <markss> Jakey you use dw for wysiswyg?
[20:24:41] <markss> if not
[20:24:42] <abjorn> qwerty ftw
[20:24:45] <markss> try netbeans its free
[20:24:48] <markss> and you will love it
[20:24:56] <Jakey> i use it cause it comes bundle
[20:24:58] <Jakey> with the suite
[20:25:08] <Jakey> i don't like installing redudant software
[20:25:21] <coldhead> good grief
[20:25:25] <coldhead> all you people are off my team
[20:25:28] <Jakey> i just it for editin code
[20:25:33] <markss> i think webstorm is the most advanced
[20:25:37] <markss> but have some bugs currently
[20:25:40] <systemfault> For JS? Yes
[20:26:00] <thathurts> holy SHIT emacs is huge
[20:26:07] <markss> emacs for linux?
[20:26:08] <abjorn> Using wysiswyg? You don't know shit about web development
[20:26:09] <thathurts> 43mb for a text editor? i'm gonna light you up, sweet cheeks
[20:26:19] <sdio> Emacs is not a text editor.
[20:26:24] <sdio> It's an OS.
[20:26:27] <systemfault> emacs... don't even waste your time with it unless you want to spend 3 hours to customize it
[20:26:29] <markss> ah lol
[20:26:30] <coldhead> ?flip @ markss
[20:26:32] <bot-t> markss, (╯‵Д′)╯彡┻━┻
[20:26:41] <markss> i'm surprised
[20:26:45] <markss> no one is using
[20:26:47] <markss> textmate or coda
[20:26:49] <coldhead> 3 hours for a lifetime of convenience? GOOD INVESTMENT
[20:26:52] <markss> maybe not the place for apple users
[20:26:53] <markss> haha
[20:27:04] <sdio> vim>emacs.
[20:27:06] <sdio> just fyi
[20:27:09] <GoGoGarrett> Coda is my favorite - notepad type editor, but Vim is so much faster.
[20:27:27] <markss> you guys need a true IDE
[20:27:30] <markss> such as webstorm
[20:27:38] <sdio> You need a pair of balls.
[20:27:40] <abjorn> notepad++ <3 works just great for me
[20:27:42] <sdio> We don't always get what we want.
[20:27:43] <systemfault> An IDE for JS?
[20:27:45] <systemfault> Why?
[20:27:52] <abjorn> I only use an IDE for C++
[20:27:53] <GoGoGarrett> You should watch someone good at Vim code
[20:28:02] <coldhead> ?w operator please
[20:28:11] <bot-t> coldhead, Operator Please - Operator Please are an Australian pop band, originating on the Gold Coast of Queensland, in 2005. Their current lineup consists of vocalist and guitarist Amandah Wilkinson, drummer Tim Commandeur, keyboardist Chris Holland, Ashley McConnell on bass guitar, and violinist Taylor Henderson. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_Please
[20:28:15] <systemfault> vim is the best editor :)
[20:28:19] <thathurts> AHAHAHAH what the FUCK. emacs has GAMES built into it? what a joke
[20:28:20] <systemfault> I said editor.
[20:28:23] <Jakey> systemfault, syntax highlight ?
[20:28:29] <systemfault> Jakey: It has.
[20:28:29] <abjorn> lol coldhead
[20:28:36] <GoGoGarrett> yes
[20:28:43] <coldhead> thathurts: emacs has a lisp interpreter in it, so it has whatever you want
[20:28:45] <sdio> thathurts: "joke"?
[20:28:45] <systemfault> Jakey: The only problem with vim is that it's a pain in the ass to get used to it.
[20:28:50] <Jakey> systemfault: no, <systemfault> An IDE for JS?
[20:28:57] <markss> not just for JS
[20:29:12] <systemfault> Jakey: Most editors have syntax highlighting for JS
[20:29:16] <markss> you may use it for html/css also
[20:29:23] <thathurts> is the next version of emacs going to come with king's quest 5? no ide is complete without that
[20:29:26] <markss> and even for php
[20:29:27] <coldhead> can i just point out that emacs is my IRC client AND YOU ARE ALL INSIDE MY EMACS RIGHT NOW
[20:29:28] <coldhead> EMACS WINS
[20:29:38] <sdio> coldhead: except when put against vim.
[20:29:50] <sdio> then it cries like a little japanese schoolgirl.
[20:29:52] <coldhead> I CAN RUN VIM INSIDE EMACS
[20:29:55] <abjorn> coldhead: we need to go deeper
[20:30:00] <sdio> :viper!
[20:30:06] <coldhead> lol
[20:30:17] <abjorn> an editor within an editor within an editor
[20:30:20] <systemfault> coldhead: Running vim in emacs is admitting that emacs has an inferior editor :P
[20:30:29] <Jakey> hahaha
[20:30:30] <GoGoGarrett> It takes about 2 weeks to get used to, and you'll be coding 5x faster than before.  Sparkup.. Surround.. pretty color schemes..custom Vimrc competely customizable to your neeeeds!
[20:30:31] <coldhead> well yes, so i never do that
[20:30:33] <Jakey> what a joke
[20:30:43] <sdio> I still prefer VS for C++, though.
[20:30:43] <coldhead> to be honest i don't really need an editor because i don't ever edit
[20:30:49] <sdio> Primarily because of intelisense.
[20:30:53] <coldhead> i just talk shit on irc
[20:30:53] <sdio> which vim cannot compete with.
[20:31:03] <sdio> *intellisense.
[20:31:11] <coldhead> intellisense is not the droids you're looking for
[20:31:12] <systemfault> sdio: I prefer an IDE for java or C# :P
[20:31:38] <sdio> systemfault: I don't do Java, but VS's debugging for C# is awesome.
[20:31:46] <thathurts> uhhhh vim looks more like qmodem than it does a text editor
[20:31:52] <gf3> rude
[20:31:52] <coldhead> hahahahahahahhaha <3
[20:32:00] <gf3> tabs!
[20:32:08] <GoGoGarrett> :tabnew
[20:32:10] <systemfault> thathurts: Both vim and emacs are a pain in the ass to learn.
[20:32:15] <sdio> systemfault: the reverisble bit is specifically awesome.
[20:32:20] <systemfault> thathurts: But they're good tools.
[20:32:25] <markss> endless debate:P
[20:32:29] <markss> so tell me php or asp?
[20:32:32] <markss> windows or linux?
[20:32:35] <sdio> Similar to using VMWare's recording when doing kernel work.
[20:32:35] <abjorn> coldhead: intellisense is useful for C++. just not javascript lol
[20:32:36] <markss> haha
[20:32:38] <systemfault> markss: asp.net
[20:32:39] <thathurts> sorry. i'll stick to notepad++. i'll let you guys have fun coding--or downloading doom from a BBS on your 2400 baud modem--because i can't tell the difference in these SHITTY editors
[20:32:39] <coldhead> freedom
[20:32:40] <systemfault> Linux
[20:32:41] <GoGoGarrett> qwerty or dvorak?!
[20:32:44] <systemfault> qwerty
[20:32:48] <Jakey> markss : Windows 8
[20:32:50] <markss> systemfault
[20:32:51] <markss> for web
[20:32:55] <gf3> 4-space hard tabs
[20:32:58] <markss> PHP is the best
[20:33:03] <coldhead> guys i am thinking of going christian -- should i go catholic or protestant?
[20:33:04] <Jakey> markss: ASP.NET
[20:33:07] <sdio> thathurts: obvious troll is awesome.
[20:33:07] <systemfault> markss: Depends on the task.
[20:33:10] <markss> Microsoft sucks
[20:33:16] <thathurts> coldhead: you'd better secure that shit
[20:33:24] <systemfault> markss: I judge on a technical level.. not philosophical
[20:33:27] <Jakey> Microsoft ROCKS!!!
[20:33:32] <gf3> coldhead: you just missed the rapture
[20:33:34] <GoGoGarrett> @thathurts http://www.derekwyatt.org/vim/vim-tutorial-videos/  watch a few of these videos and see how quick you can become!
[20:33:41] <markss> ah you are right
[20:33:47] <sdio> GoGoGarrett: stop trying to convert him.
[20:33:48] <Jakey> dam right i'm right
[20:33:50] <Jakey> markss
[20:33:53] <sdio> I don't want idiots using vim
[20:33:58] <systemfault> For example, I prefer C# to Java.
[20:34:08] <systemfault> Even if Java is more "free"
[20:34:09] <sdio> systemfault: that's pure logic, nothing philosophical about it.
[20:34:15] <sdio> C# is the better language.
[20:34:21] <coldhead> logic is a branch of philosophy
[20:34:23] <GoGoGarrett> Ruby
[20:34:33] <thathurts> idiots = people who appreciate the advances in UIs during the past 15 years and don't want to code in QMODEM
[20:34:35] <systemfault> Ruby... weird thing.
[20:34:39] <gf3> python
[20:34:50] <gf3> and silverlight
[20:34:51] <coldhead> ?w qmodem
[20:34:52] <sdio> coldhead: Philosophy is a branch of bullshit.
[20:35:11] <systemfault> Nobody seems to care about Ruby and Rails... but every other frameworks & langages steal its ideas
[20:35:12] <bot-t> coldhead, Qmodem - Qmodem was an MS-DOS shareware telecommunications program and terminal emulator. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qmodem
[20:35:13] <markss> for enterprise level applications i think java is a good chooice than c#
[20:35:14] <sdio> Or simply another way of saying "we can all be right". No, we can't.
[20:35:25] <markss> if you are looking something light-weight,fast,free
[20:35:31] <GoGoGarrett> you can download macvim, for a gui, but it's the same thing
[20:35:31] <sdio> haha
[20:35:31] <markss> LAMP is better
[20:35:36] <sdio> java + light-weight in the same sentence.
[20:35:43] <coldhead> you must be like a million years old, thathurts
[20:35:46] <markss> no sdio
[20:35:49] <systemfault> Java isn't lightweight but plenty fast.
[20:35:51] <markss> i ts for enterprise level applications
[20:35:57] <sdio> systemfault: Compared to?
[20:36:01] <coldhead> oh yeah, i've heard of enterprise
[20:36:08] <systemfault> sdio: PHP.. Ruby.. Python
[20:36:08] <coldhead> i'm gonna try enterprise some day
[20:36:11] <sdio> The only thing good about Java is the JVM.
[20:36:13] <coldhead> it sounds good
[20:36:20] <systemfault> sdio: C# should be as good speedwise
[20:36:36] <systemfault> Java enterprise tools are more mature though.
[20:36:45] <sdio> systemfault: it should be better, but, it's the CLR is not multi-platform so it's not a fair comparison
[20:36:47] <markss> well use c# if you want to make career
[20:36:53] <markss> use php if you want to make an impact:P
[20:37:00] <sdio> -it's.
[20:37:01] <thathurts> visual studio is very nice. it's way better than eclipse and other ides i've used
[20:37:12] <systemfault> So, I guess I'd use Java for the backend of a website dealing with money.
[20:37:17] <thathurts> eclipse is a memory sucking monster. it always runs and feels like shit
[20:37:18] <systemfault> Not PHP.
[20:37:28] <sdio> systemfault: I've come to like Python an awful lot.
[20:37:30] <systemfault> thathurts: Eclipse is excellent...... ONLY FOR JAVA.
[20:37:48] <thathurts> systemfault: feature wise, maybe, but it STILL runs like shit
[20:37:55] <markss> most of CMS systems are written by PHP
[20:38:01] <thathurts> visual studio can be absolutely blazing fast
[20:38:07] <markss> wordpress,joomla,drupal
[20:38:32] <coldhead> well this has all been very enlightening
[20:38:34] <thathurts> markss: sharepoint isn't :3
[20:38:38] <systemfault> coldhead: Haha
[20:38:39] <coldhead> but i must go circumcise myself now
[20:38:41] <sdio> coldhead: I want bans
[20:38:43] <sdio> BANS
[20:38:44] <systemfault> coldhead: Eww
[20:38:59] <gf3> coldhead: be careful, save the foreskin!
[20:39:00] <coldhead> yeah i hear that sdio, that's why i;'m taking a break and a bit off the top
[20:39:03] <sdio> Y u h8 FREEDOM?
[20:39:05] <abjorn> coldhead: Hey, it's more fun than using svn at least
[20:39:08] <systemfault> coldhead: Chew the foreskin after.
[20:39:15] <coldhead> ew
[20:39:19] <thathurts> to be honest, sharepoint 2010 is actually pretty good
[20:39:19] <abjorn> wow this is worse than the charizard rape story
[20:39:20] <sdio> coldhead: only if you're a rabbi.
[20:39:31] <sdio> mazel tov!
[20:39:31] <thathurts> <=2007 sucks balls
[20:39:36] <thathurts> but sharepoint 2010 is actually kind of cool
[20:39:42] * coldhead marvels at the power of circumcision to derail a conversation about IDEs
[20:39:43] <sdio> stfu vim hater
[20:40:22] <thathurts> drupal and wordpress have such shitty editors. i would NOT want to be the guy managing content on those trainwrecks
[20:40:28] <thathurts> although to be fair almost every web html editor is a sack of shit
[20:41:00] <systemfault> jsfiddle isn't that bad :P
[20:41:17] <sdio> screw it, this got boring.
[20:41:24] <sdio> I'm going to go chop off coldhead's foreskin.
[20:41:33] <systemfault> sdio: With a pizza cutter
[20:41:37] <thathurts> jsfiddle isn't even an end user editor
[20:41:41] <thathurts> it's for people who actually know html
[20:41:42] <sdio> systemfault: I said foreskin, not penis.
[20:41:59] <thathurts> i don't think there is a truly good html editor for non-technical people yet
[20:42:23] <osugregor> what about dreamweaver?
[20:42:31] <systemfault> Ewww
[20:42:37] <systemfault> osugregor: Worst thing ever.
[20:42:37] <osugregor> good for beginners
[20:42:37] <thathurts> dreamweaver is still going to give you stuff that looks like dogshit in ie7
[20:42:58] <osugregor> well, a beginner will give something that is worse than dogshit without it
[20:43:16] <thathurts> part of the problem is that css is such an obtuse sack of shit that it's incredibly difficult to make an editor that can output good, cross browser code
[20:43:17] <systemfault> You know.. if you can't even learn HTML and CSS... find another career
[20:43:24] <systemfault> They're simple tools.
[20:43:41] <systemfault> You don't even need javascript to write a fine website nowadays
[20:43:48] <thathurts> systemfault: some people are incredible artists who can design great looking stuff but they just have some mental block or are technically retarded and can't handle tags
[20:44:25] <thathurts> it's why you have "designers" and people who actually implement crap
[20:44:28] <systemfault> thathurts: I know that... And I'm the opposite... I can write code but have no artistic skills
[20:44:45] <thathurts> systemfault: well, that's why there's a demand for non technical html editors
[20:45:09] <systemfault> thathurts: That's bad, artists should use photoshop/illustrator/whatever...
[20:45:23] <systemfault> And give the damn psd/ai/*.* to the coder
[20:46:21] <osugregor> thats why we must rely on shit released software like IE7, in order to prevent non-technical editors, so we have more cash-inflow
[20:46:34] <abjorn> ?zalgo
[20:46:36] <systemfault> I don't know if it changed a lot but last time I've seen someone use DW, it was still a bunch of ugly tables.
[20:46:36] <bot-t> H̹̙̦̮͉̩̗̗ͧ̇̏̊̾Eͨ͆͒̆ͮ̃͏̷̮̣̫̤̣ ̵̞̹̻̀̉̓ͬ͑͡ͅCͯ̂͐͏̨̛͔̦̟͈̻O̜͎͍͙͚̬̝̣̽ͮ͐͗̀ͤ̍̀͢M̴̡̲̭͍͇̼̟̯̦̉̒͠Ḛ̛̙̞̪̗ͥͤͩ̾͑̔͐ͅṮ̴̷̷̗̼͍̿̿̓̽͐H̙̙̔̄͜
[20:47:16] <systemfault> Damn IRSSI doesn't like unicode abuse
[20:48:54] <thathurts> well just think about it
[20:49:03] <thathurts> a table structure would be way easier to figure out
[20:49:08] <thathurts> than css's bullshit rules
[20:49:16] <thathurts> css is fucking weird. it's pretty terrible. we need something better
[20:49:37] <systemfault> thathurts: CSS isn't that bad, its box model is total crap though
[20:49:49] <systemfault> CSS3 kind of fix it though
[20:50:16] <thathurts> css3: the thing i'll be able to use in 2016 after everyone's finally upgraded to ie9 or better
[20:50:35] <systemfault> Who's the retard who thought that it might be a good idea that the width of a box is the width of its content..
[20:51:09] <GoGoGarrett> well the browser pre-fixes really help that
[20:51:19] <GoGoGarrett> You get everything but basically IE, and they can really live without it
[20:51:38] <GoGoGarrett> But I agree, it will be awhile before it' entirely compatable
[20:52:01] <thathurts> there are a lot of terrible things about css. there's really no sense of columns even though it's the most basic fucking layout that 99% of the planet expects and wants
[20:52:43] <dismist> can someone tell me what is the difference between a synchronous and asynchronous $.ajax request? (i am trying to get $.ajax to post the results in a div if the php script as the php script outputs... it is a long running script, and i want the div to continue outputting data while the script runs until i terminate it)
[20:53:11] <systemfault> dismist: synchrous will BLOCK and wait for the data
[20:53:48] <systemfault> asynchronous will continue without blocking and when the date will be received, the callback function will be executed
[20:54:15] <GoGoGarrett> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/
[20:54:24] <systemfault> s/date/data
[20:54:59] <thathurts> GoGoGarrett: i know. that's great, BUT the implementation in different browsers isn't consistent and like i said, i have to support ie7 for customers until like 2016
[20:55:14] <systemfault> dismist: You usually want async.
[20:55:23] <thathurts> css3 columns are REALLY buggy in firefox right now too
[20:55:24] <systemfault> dismist: Because blocking the browser is bad.
[20:55:41] <GoGoGarrett> I understand, I'm just saying hopefully we'll be to the point where it's fesiable
[20:56:01] <thathurts> i just can't help but feel that they should have just started from scratch instead of sticking with css
[20:56:12] <thathurts> because the reality of the situation is that css3 is essentially a clean break compatibility wise anyway
[20:56:44] <systemfault> What?
[20:56:49] <systemfault> CSS3 doesn't break anything.
[20:56:51] <babonk> Hey if anyone has experience with jQuery flexbox I'm really stuck on trying to update its results
[20:56:55] <systemfault> It's an "addon"
[20:57:39] <thathurts> systemfault: i mean that most people are stuck with supporting ie8 for a while anyway
[20:57:53] <thathurts> so css3 is going to require a whole new browser for those people anyway
[20:58:09] <systemfault> Meh.
[20:58:29] <systemfault> Some of the CSS3 features are purely esthetic...
[20:58:30] <GoGoGarrett> Perhaps IE should force everyone to update to IE 9 where things actually work, instead of giving people the option, that they always ignore
[20:58:46] <systemfault> Who cares if the IE users have squared corners instead of round.
[20:58:50] <thathurts> microsoft has too many conflicts of interest to do anything that makes sense
[20:58:54] <systemfault> Or if they don't have drop shadows..
[20:59:19] <thathurts> systemfault: i'd want to use css3 for more interesting things like elegant resizing so that i could use the same layouts/css for both mobile and desktop versions of a site
[20:59:21] <systemfault> GoGoGarrett: They can't.... Corps.
[20:59:34] <systemfault> thathurts: I'd love that too :/
[20:59:46] <GoGoGarrett> They make flexiable frameworks that we can work with now
[21:00:03] <thathurts> microsoft wanted people to upgrade to windows 7
[21:00:07] <GoGoGarrett> 1140 is a great one we use for our projects
[21:00:09] <thathurts> so they looked for artificial ways of forcing an upgrade
[21:00:15] <thathurts> like making ie9 only work on vista and 7
[21:00:25] <thathurts> like i said, they have too many conflicts of interest to ever do the right thing
[21:00:36] <systemfault> Well.. I don't want to be a bitch but...
[21:00:39] <systemfault> XP should die.
[21:00:50] <systemfault> That damn OS has lived long enough.
[21:01:00] <dismist> systemfault: i am writing a dropcatcher where the domain is repeatedly attempted to be registered, so it is important that the script steadily output data every 10 seconds or so, until the user cancels it, at which point i use the abort method to stop the script from running server side
[21:01:08] <GoGoGarrett> It was the best, but I agree windows 7 does look rather nice - comparatively to vista
[21:01:09] <thathurts> in a perfect world i'd love for everyone to upgrade but think about all the situations where you run into problems
[21:01:13] <dismist> i cant determine if i should run this synchronously or asynchronously
[21:01:15] <thathurts> some people just don't have a lot of money
[21:01:19] <thathurts> and are fine with their xp boxes
[21:01:26] <thathurts> and if you want your shit to work on public library computers
[21:01:35] <thathurts> they're going to have xp 10 years from now
[21:01:37] <systemfault> dismist: Forget that "sync" exists.
[21:01:54] <systemfault> thathurts: That's their problem.
[21:02:01] <dismist> can i still make the data output into my div as the php outputs it?
[21:02:04] <systemfault> thathurts: Linux exists.
[21:02:08] <GoGoGarrett> But It really depends who your client is, I mean if you're working for a major org. you may have to make it work back for ie7, but for most clients I work with, they are entirely fine with it working in ie8+
[21:02:08] <dismist> then run the callback when the script is finally finished
[21:02:13] <dismist> it could run for up to 2 hours
[21:02:32] <thathurts> yeah library computers really should all be on linux
[21:02:52] <systemfault> GoGoGarrett: A lot of corps still have IE6 because that's the browser that was bundled with XP
[21:03:09] <systemfault> GoGoGarrett: And since XP's EOL is on April 8th 2014...
[21:03:31] <systemfault> GoGoGarrett: We'll still hear of IE6 for a long time..
[21:03:36] <thathurts> and a lot of companies are dependent on shitty internal apps that only work on ie6 or they have some assy software that only works on ie6
[21:03:42] <systemfault> yeah.
[21:04:08] <thathurts> i still think it's funny though
[21:04:11] <GoGoGarrett> Progressive enhancement.  I'd rather do as much as I can for the people who will experience it, and for all others, give them a shitty website that works, and is bareable.
[21:04:12] <thathurts> even microsoft is trying to get people off ie6
[21:04:13] <thathurts> http://www.theie6countdown.com/default.aspx
[21:04:35] <thathurts> sharepoint 2010 sites don't even work in ie6
[21:05:08] <thathurts> i still think the numbers on that site are bullshit
[21:05:18] <thathurts> more than 2.3% of the united states is still on ie6. they're full of shit
[21:06:15] <systemfault> GoGoGarrett: Yeah, I agree, PE is the way to go
[21:06:23] <GoGoGarrett> But honestly, I'm sure a great deal of them are retired old folks who don't use their computer - or.. people who are incompent with computers regardless, and who cares what they think honestly?
[21:06:43] <systemfault> GoGoGarrett: And devs should begin to accept that a website can look a bit different on every browser.
[21:06:52] <GoGoGarrett> I agree
[21:07:03] <thathurts> i disagree with that. there really should be standards for this stuff
[21:07:06] <systemfault> (OH NOES, no drop shadow on a box on IE.... big f.... deal)
[21:07:07] <thathurts> it's a ridiculous amount of overhead
[21:07:10] <thathurts> and a waste of time
[21:07:16] <thathurts> to test a site on so many browsers
[21:07:29] <systemfault> thathurts: We'll be more and more living with "living standards"
[21:07:53] <systemfault> thathurts: The days of "I got this featureset to work with" are over
[21:08:02] <GoGoGarrett> Well you design the site, test it on all the browsers, and if one has a bug, you make it look nice.  You don't have to force it and hack it to make it look exactly like the other browsers
[21:08:18] <GoGoGarrett> As long as they're getting a decent experience, they aren't going to check on every browser to make sure it's the same, they just want it to work and be appealing
[21:08:26] <thathurts> and i think that performance is a huge issue too. it's not just that ie6 doesn't support some css bullshit. ie6's javascript engine is so fucking slow that a site with heavy duty javascript code will probably not run acceptably on it
[21:09:04] <thathurts> i mean gmail doesn't really work on ie6. google stopped supporting it because it couldn't run it fast enough
[21:09:18] <GoGoGarrett> Thanks to paul irish's boiler plate -<!-- Always force latest IE rendering engine (even in intranet) & Chrome Frame
[21:09:18] <GoGoGarrett>        Remove this if you use the .htaccess -->
[21:09:19] <GoGoGarrett>   <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge,chrome=1">
[21:09:36] <GoGoGarrett> Forced them to use the most current js engin if they're on an older one
[21:10:26] <thathurts> that basically just turns off quirks mode
[21:10:34] <thathurts> i don't think it has any impact on JS performance
[21:10:39] <thathurts> ie6 is still going to run js like dogshit
[21:11:07] <GoGoGarrett> well if they're using Ie 6, but they have a newer verison of ie downloaded or chrome on their computer or osmething, it'll render the latest js engine
[21:11:17] <GoGoGarrett> Or so I believe, i'm not absolutely postieve, but I think that's right.
[21:11:23] <systemfault> even IE8 is dogslow..
[21:11:25] <systemfault> Seriously.
[21:11:35] <thathurts> haha okay but i think the whole issue is that if you have chrome or ie7+ installed, you'd be using that anyway, right?
[21:11:46] <thathurts> it's not that easy to even have multiple versions of ie on a box
[21:11:49] <GoGoGarrett> I understand, but some people dont' know
[21:11:59] <GoGoGarrett> My dad knows the Internet as the blue E logo
[21:12:04] <GoGoGarrett> he has no idea how anything works
[21:12:19] <GoGoGarrett> So I use his pC i use chrome, he uses it.. he uses blue E haha
[21:12:27] <systemfault> Exactly.
[21:12:34] <systemfault> People don't even know what a browser is.
[21:12:37] <GoGoGarrett> But it would still render the chrome engine
[21:12:42] <systemfault> Even worse.. they don't care.
[21:12:48] <systemfault> It's "the internet"
[21:12:53] <GoGoGarrett> exactly, they just want it to work
[21:13:19] <systemfault> Eventually, not now.. IE should go with the chrome updating model
[21:13:39] <systemfault> When the old non-standard mode of IE will be dead.
[21:13:56] <thathurts> they're not going to do that unless they stop playing the "you have to upgrade your OS to use the latest IE" game
[21:14:19] <thathurts> "oh but internet explorer 14 needs directx 14. GOTTA UPGRADE"
[21:14:26] <GoGoGarrett> Bad news is, someone owns gogogarrett.com so how am I ever going to swindle that away from him.
[21:14:36] <systemfault> thathurts: You're exagerating.
[21:14:42] <systemfault> XP is too old... let it go.
[21:14:49] <GoGoGarrett> thats the real issue at hand
[21:14:50] <systemfault> I agree with MS's move on that.
[21:14:56] <thathurts> systemfault: that's exactly what happened with ie9 though. there was NO reason ie9 couldn't have had a fallback
[21:15:01] <thathurts> to render without directx10
[21:15:11] <systemfault> I'm fine with that.
[21:15:23] <systemfault> It's totally fine, XP should die.
[21:15:24] <thathurts> i find the whole thing pretty ridiculous anyway
[21:15:25] <systemfault> Enough.
[21:15:30] <systemfault> It's been more than a decade.
[21:15:30] <thathurts> i mean
[21:15:39] <thathurts> they want us to believe that directx9 wasn't good enough for a browser
[21:15:54] <thathurts> and yet id's new game, which isn't even out yet, uses directx9
[21:15:55] <thathurts> i see
[21:15:59] <thathurts> good enough for a cutting edge 3d game
[21:16:04] <thathurts> but insufficient for a fucking web browser
[21:16:11] <systemfault> ...
[21:16:24] <systemfault> DirectX 9 doesn't have their "Direct2D API"
[21:16:26] <GoGoGarrett> They're trying to make dem dollars
[21:16:40] <systemfault> They must move on.
[21:17:00] <thathurts> that's my whole point. they didn't NEED to use direct2d. in fact, most people think that it was completely unnecessary and even more complicated than direct3d 9
[21:17:08] <systemfault> I wouldn't agree if they said that IE10 wouldn't support vista.
[21:17:14] <systemfault> But XP... come on.
[21:17:21] <systemfault> thathurts: Sure they need.
[21:17:38] <thathurts> i think everyone should have stuck with opengl, but that's just me
[21:17:45] <systemfault> thathurts: And Chrome + Mozilla have followed MS
[21:17:55] <systemfault> They all implemented acceleration.
[21:17:55] <gf3> thathurts: allegedly, ID Tech 6 will be OpenGL
[21:18:17] <thathurts> gf3: the xbox360 version at least uses direct3d, because 360 games don't use opengl
[21:19:12] <gf3> thathurts: indeed, I just thought it was an interesting point re: dx, d3d, etc...
[21:19:16] <systemfault> Big engines abstract graphic libraries.
[21:19:21] <thathurts> gf3: look at this though
[21:19:24] <thathurts> gf3: http://www.anandtech.com/show/2575
[21:19:29] <thathurts> [Ed: Interesting to note is that Rage for the PC will apparently not use OpenGL as is standard for id Software; however, the Mac version will use OpenGL. Perhaps DirectX has reached the point where Carmack no longer feels it's a handicap, or maybe he's just throwing in the towel as one of the few remaining holdouts.]
[21:19:51] <amid_hasan> hello
[21:19:55] <systemfault> Carmack said that D3D was better than OGL..
[21:20:06] <thathurts> yeah
[21:20:13] <systemfault> It wasn't the case before.
[21:20:31] <systemfault> Now OGL is just playing catchup with DX
[21:20:32] <thathurts> if microsoft had backed opengl, it would have been better too
[21:20:34] <gf3> that's why it's interesting that Tech 6 will be OpenGL
[21:20:35] <amid_hasan> how do i do a login script or maintain a "session" across multiple pages inside an application using jquer/js html5 only, and calling remote scripts fetching data back with json etc?
[21:20:48] <thathurts> but they unnecessarily created another standard
[21:20:53] <thathurts> and drug everyone through the mud
[21:20:54] <thathurts> for no reason
[21:21:02] <gf3> amid_hasan: same concept as the backend
[21:21:12] <gf3> amid_hasan: session cookie + session store
[21:21:39] <amid_hasan> session cookie and session store are javascript methods?
[21:23:13] <abjorn> wtf for a minute i thought i was in #vidyadev because of the DX/GL talk
[21:23:40] <amid_hasan> also, should i create some sort of token before i post to remote script to verify origin?
[21:36:24] <shiftins> quit
[21:37:46] <abjorn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et4-qetca6s such is life in the zone
[21:41:00] <GoGoGarrett> All these books and tutorials, i'm ready to be competent.. :/
[21:41:37] <coldhead> 10000 hours :)
[21:41:39] <coldhead> good luck!
[21:42:35] <GoGoGarrett> I wish there was a site with dummy  problems to fix.  Instead of creating pointless project examples and then later trying to apply them to real working cases.
[21:42:47] <GoGoGarrett> I like the CodeCaynon thing on Ruby on rails, but their jquery thing is like 50 bucks..meh im cheap.
[21:43:36] <coldhead> the railstutorial has you build a pretty decent twitter clone
[21:43:43] <coldhead> and there's a lot of scope to add features
[21:44:06] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah, I enjoyed going through it.  I bet their jquery one would be nice to watch, but 45$ is a lot.
[21:44:20] <coldhead> yeah fuck that
[21:47:57] <thathurts> GoGoGarrett: what would be even more interesting is a site with REAL problems to fix that pays you a cut if you successfully fix them
[21:48:15] <thathurts> learning = $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
[21:48:59] <GoGoGarrett> That would be awesome, but I am afraid I would not be capable of answering any of those questions currently haha but that would be an interesting concept
[21:49:38] <GoGoGarrett> Perhaps I wont have to, i'll just make that site..
[21:49:38] <GoGoGarrett> :p
[21:50:33] <thathurts> foiled again
[21:50:37] <thathurts> i need to keep my lips zipped
[21:51:32] <thathurts> really though, when you think about it
[21:51:38] <thathurts> way too much time is wasted on "dummy" problems
[21:51:43] <thathurts> why not actually DO SOMETHING?
[21:52:07] <GoGoGarrett> I agree, I finished all my clients work today, but I still would like to develop my skills haha
[21:52:10] <coldhead> results are overrated
[22:08:36] <zem> good evening jqueriers
[22:08:58] <zem> i've been struggling with a little issue for awhile now and i hope someone here can tell me what i'm doing wrong
[22:09:35] <coldhead> have you tried restarting your browser?
[22:10:14] <zem> basically i'm doing $(".time").each(function (i, v) { $(v).text("blah"); })
[22:10:30] <coldhead> reasonablegoods.com contains malware. Your computer might catch a virus if you visit this site.
[22:10:31] <systemfault> Try using .html instead
[22:10:37] <zem> with the expectation that it should replace all divs of class=time with the text "blah"
[22:10:41] <zem> systemfault: nope, neither works
[22:10:47] <zem> it's like it's working on a copy instead of a reference
[22:10:53] <systemfault> Then write a small test on jsfiddle :(
[22:11:03] <coldhead> ?p
[22:11:04] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[22:11:14] <zem> i tried doing times = $(".time") and changed times[i], still doesn't change it
[22:11:35] <coldhead> the way you are doing it Definitely Works
[22:11:59] <zem> okay, that's at least a start.  let me play with jsfiddle
[22:13:10] <GoGoGarrett> I have a side question, I don't understanding the two paramaters he's passing, I see it in tons of functions and I'm not sure how it exaclty works.  I am from a c++ background, and I know you can pass by refrence and stuff, but I don't see those values declared so are they annoyouce?
[22:13:10] <coldhead> zem http://jsfiddle.net/nEED6/
[22:13:16] <zem> actually, i'm doing it on an ajax response and then .append()ing that to my page
[22:13:37] <systemfault> GoGoGarrett: Where?
[22:13:44] <zem> which might be the cause of the issue
[22:13:59] <systemfault> GoGoGarrett: I also have a C++ background, I might be able to help.
[22:14:04] <coldhead> GoGoGarrett: those arguments are provided by jQuery's each() function are are so documented
[22:14:04] <gf3> GoGoGarrett: those are from map
[22:14:07] <coldhead> ?each
[22:14:08] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[22:14:15] <coldhead> and are*
[22:14:43] <gf3> GoGoGarrett: what is REALLY strange, though, is the order of the arguments is different than the native map implemented by browsers
[22:15:02] <systemfault> gf3: Yeah, that's sucks... but I think I understand why
[22:15:10] <coldhead> how dare you disrespect jQuery, gf3
[22:15:16] <coldhead> clearly browsers are wrong
[22:15:21] <systemfault> gf3: Because the second arg is redundant because of the value of "this"
[22:15:30] * gf3 unzips and pees on jeresig
[22:15:37] <coldhead> !!!!!
[22:15:46] <systemfault> coldhead: Kill him!
[22:15:49] <systemfault> Kill the heretic!
[22:15:50] <coldhead> !!!!! !!!!!
[22:15:50] <GoGoGarrett> So the values I and V he's passing are arugments that can be passed in by .each function, and can be called whatever you wish?
[22:15:55] <gf3> systemfault: yes, the context is a nice addition by jQ
[22:15:58] <GoGoGarrett> they're index and the element
[22:16:03] <gf3> and should be used instead of the args
[22:16:10] <gf3> to avoid conflicts with the real map
[22:16:18] <coldhead> function (lol, aids)
[22:16:31] <GoGoGarrett> but it would elentially do the same thing correct
[22:16:32] <systemfault> GoGoGarrett: Basically, in c++ speak, .each takes a functor taking two arguments
[22:16:44] <coldhead> lol c++
[22:16:58] <iszak> lol clojure
[22:17:00] <systemfault> GoGoGarrett: A closure is an inline function like a c++0x lambda
[22:17:15] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah, but I just don't understand from an annoymuse function because typically you would do someFunciton(index,blarg)
[22:17:19] <coldhead> oh god
[22:17:27] <GoGoGarrett> and pass by refrence
[22:17:46] <systemfault> .each([=](int i, node j){ dosomethingwithnode(node); })
[22:18:00] <iszak> ew
[22:18:02] <zem> man, you guys are already using c++1x?
[22:18:12] <systemfault> zem: Only for hobby projects.
[22:18:14] <GoGoGarrett> And the index just isnt being used in that funciton?
[22:18:16] <zem> ah, got it
[22:18:22] <systemfault> GoGoGarrett: Yeah..
[22:18:38] <zem> i wonder how many years it will be before my employer adopts a version of g++ that will let me use 'auto'
[22:18:43] <acidjazz> 6whATS TAHT ZEM
[22:18:45] <acidjazz> err whats that zem
[22:18:50] <systemfault> zem: type inferance ftw :D
[22:18:50] <zem> c++1x?
[22:18:55] <systemfault> C++11 :)
[22:19:00] <zem> systemfault: seriously, it's only been 30 years
[22:19:11] <djQuery> ?ui.accordion
[22:19:12] <systemfault> zem: The last standard is from 2003..
[22:19:16] <bot-t> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[22:19:19] <systemfault> zem: Not exactly 30 years :P
[22:19:24] <GoGoGarrett> Thanks, I understand-more so now
[22:19:26] <zem> ah is that the final name?  i guess they did just ratify the proposal
[22:19:32] <iszak> I don't like this talk of lower level programming languages, it makes my brain hurt.
[22:19:33] <zem> i meant since the beginning of c++ :)
[22:19:48] <zem> yeah, sorry, i'll take it to #c++
[22:19:54] <systemfault> zem: It's supposed to, the final draft has been recently sent to the ISO committy
[22:19:58] <systemfault> Yeah, right :)
[22:20:03] <systemfault> Sorry for being offtopic :P
[22:20:05] <coldhead> so then i was all mov eax, 4c00h
[22:20:17] <coldhead> int 21h
[22:20:31] <systemfault> Tss
[22:20:37] <zem> int 21h is high-level, i'm all int 13
[22:20:39] <systemfault> int 21h won't work :)
[22:20:43] <systemfault> Protected mode.
[22:20:46] <iszak> stop this! just stop it!!!
[22:20:58] <coldhead> sorry iszak
[22:21:01] <coldhead> slow day is slow
[22:21:06] <systemfault> zem: I'll breakpoint you!
[22:21:19] <systemfault> So... jquery is fun :/
[22:21:21] <iszak> why can't people just use C#
[22:21:23] <systemfault> Back to topic
[22:21:37] <acidjazz> why are ut alking about c in a javascript channel
[22:21:40] <coldhead> because of mono patent fears, izepstan
[22:21:45] <coldhead> lol iszak *
[22:21:45] <systemfault> iszak: C++ and C# aren't competitors.. They're not used in the same context.
[22:21:45] <thathurts> c# really isn't as performant as c++ or c yet
[22:21:50] <coldhead> sorry izey
[22:21:50] <acidjazz> c++/c wether or not using the newer standards is crap
[22:21:58] <acidjazz> javascript > *
[22:22:05] <systemfault> Javascript is lovely.
[22:22:11] <coldhead> don't say performant
[22:22:13] <systemfault> Even more when you can use ecmascript 5
[22:22:16] <acidjazz> i wish i could code everything in javascript
[22:22:17] <coldhead> it's not a real word
[22:22:25] <acidjazz> yea latest ecma
[22:22:30] <systemfault> coldhead: Oh noes, it's the inception!
[22:22:39] <systemfault> We need to go deeper.
[22:22:42] <iszak> ;_; I have to install Microsoft Silverlight
[22:22:49] <Nuckin> does anyone have a workaround for safari not loading dynamically generated CSS?
[22:23:07] <zem> okay, so, if i modify the ajax response and then append it to the div, it doesn't show the substitution; but if i append it to the div, and modify every .time on the page, it does the substitution
[22:23:14] <thathurts> c# isn't really good enough for games or anything performance dependent
[22:23:24] <systemfault> thathurts: Indeed
[22:23:29] <zem> are ajax responses read-only or something?
[22:23:37] <iszak> thathurts, sure it is
[22:23:59] <iszak> thathurts, these days people don't have a 400 MHz processor and 32 MB of RAM, C# is fine for performance
[22:23:59] <thathurts> iszak: only low end/simple games
[22:24:15] <iszak> most people have 4/8 GB of RAM, quadcores
[22:24:20] <systemfault> Garbage collectors.. they kill performance.
[22:24:28] <thathurts> you could not do [high end game here] on an xbox360 in c#
[22:24:43] <phrancescot> very new to jquery, so go easy  :)  http://pastebin.com/SENpVijX i've done a very simple 'click this to hide/show a div'...
[22:24:45] <iszak> but the xbox 360 is a piece of shit of hardware
[22:24:50] <iszak> it's 5 years old, stop living in the past.
[22:25:00] <thathurts> and supposedly 70% of game sales are on consoles
[22:25:09] <thathurts> and the most popular console, the wii, is less powerful than the 360
[22:25:11] <iszak> that's because only poor people use consoles.
[22:25:15] <thathurts> start living on planet earth
[22:25:23] <systemfault> iszak: BS :/
[22:25:26] <iszak> too many poor people buying consoles.
[22:25:38] <phrancescot> instead of showing text 'hide/show' which i have now, i want it to toggle from hide (when it's being shown) to show (when it's hidden) and back and forth...
[22:25:39] <acidjazz> you guys are nerds
[22:25:47] <iszak> NO U
[22:25:47] <systemfault> Not a lot of game styles are playable on PCs.
[22:25:57] <systemfault> FPS? RTS? beside that...
[22:25:59] <thathurts> systemfault: technically every style of game is playable on a PC
[22:26:06] <coldhead> ?toggle @ phrancescot
[22:26:08] <bot-t> phrancescot, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[22:26:15] <GoGoGarrett> slideToggle
[22:26:17] <thathurts> systemfault: you can use a wii remote on a pc. you can connect an arcade joystick to a pc
[22:26:18] <iszak> systemfault, lolwhat you wish, FPS are better on PC's same with RTS
[22:26:29] <coldhead> damn you bot-t
[22:26:30] <iszak> systemfault, you've got more precision with a mouse than a controller, fuck those analog sticks
[22:26:32] <systemfault> iszak: That's what I said.
[22:26:46] <iszak> i hate analog sticks, they're too sensitive
[22:26:52] <systemfault> iszak: Except these two types, consoles are better.
[22:27:00] <thathurts> systemfault: did you read what i said?
[22:27:12] <systemfault> thathurts: And?
[22:27:12] <thathurts> you can plug ANY game input device into a pc
[22:27:21] <thathurts> so there is no "type" of game that's better on consoles
[22:27:50] <thathurts> the best version of street fighter 4, for fuck's sake, is the pc version
[22:27:52] <systemfault> Well, the day I'll buy a 50" PC screen to play games with friends.. I'll agree.
[22:27:54] <iszak> systemfault, depends but yeah I know what you're getting up, and I agree for performance C/C++ but they generally leverage a framework that's written in C/C++ for graphics, can't you use hooks into C/C++ in C#?
[22:28:06] <thathurts> systemfault: you can plug a pc into a 50" tv
[22:28:25] <systemfault> iszak: Sure, interop has a performance price though.
[22:28:34] <iszak> console kills graphics too
[22:28:35] <systemfault> iszak: The CLR is well isolated.
[22:28:40] <iszak> did you see Crysis 2? what a shame.
[22:28:40] <thathurts> there is no "type" of game that can't be done on a pc
[22:28:45] * phrancescot wonders if he typed in #gaming and not #jquery...
[22:28:46] <systemfault> iszak: The best is still a C++ core with a scripting engine on it.
[22:28:54] <systemfault> iszak: Like LUA for example.
[22:29:03] <thathurts> yup
[22:29:08] <thathurts> that's how most of the software is now
[22:29:09] <coldhead> phrancescot: http://jsfiddle.net/B87FE/
[22:29:19] <thathurts> a really optimized c++ engine with a scripting engine on top of it
[22:29:34] <iszak> sounds good
[22:29:50] <systemfault> C++ doesn't have a garbage collector so the performance is previsible
[22:29:59] <iszak> memory leaks ftw
[22:30:04] <coldhead> phrancescot: http://jsfiddle.net/B87FE/1/
[22:30:04] <iszak> I like garbage collection
[22:30:12] <systemfault> Unlike managed languages like C# where memory is freed when the GC feels it.
[22:30:16] <coldhead> previsible?
[22:30:32] <systemfault> iszak: For most applications, having a garbage collector is a must.
[22:30:34] <acidjazz> man when is resig gonna release that new js book
[22:30:37] <iszak> systemfault, I'm sure you have some control over the frequency of GC
[22:30:44] <phrancescot> thanks coldhead but that's essentially what i've got now...i want the text (where you've got "Click Me") to change once clicked...
[22:30:45] <systemfault> iszak: More or less
[22:30:52] <gf3> sure there is
[22:30:52] <gf3> split screen games
[22:30:53] <thathurts> there are all kinds of other problems with c# such as the latency it introduces into games. if you write a game in c# you are going to be stuck with rendering and input latency that you can minimize in other languages. java has the same problem. they SUCK for real games
[22:30:55] <iszak> so what the problem at?
[22:30:57] <systemfault> iszak: C# has using statements for example.
[22:31:30] <iszak> thathurts, it's because the computers suck
[22:31:37] <iszak> and can't run C#/Java efficiently
[22:32:15] <thathurts> i think it's a problem with virtual machines in general actually
[22:32:15] <coldhead> phrancescot: http://jsfiddle.net/B87FE/2/
[22:32:42] <iszak> thathurts, probably
[22:33:06] <iszak> oh well, it's all about the web now and JS
[22:33:31] <coldhead> phrancescot: http://jsfiddle.net/B87FE/3/
[22:33:39] <thathurts> but really, i'm sick of hearing "pcs are only good for rts and fps games," which is such a crock of horseshit. a good pc is orders of magnitude more capable of running and playing any genre of game
[22:33:51] <thathurts> look at this
[22:33:59] <coldhead> bLAH BLAH BLAH TURING MACHINES
[22:34:02] <coldhead> that's what i'm hearing
[22:34:03] <thathurts> this is metroid prime running on the pc at 2560x1600
[22:34:04] <systemfault> thathurts: You like to play games with friends on a 22" monitor?
[22:34:08] <thathurts> http://gaaamer.com/images/prime.png
[22:34:14] <thathurts> so yes, gamecube games are better on the pc than the gamecube
[22:34:15] <phrancescot> coldhead: thanks!  i think i can work from that...
[22:34:26] <systemfault> thathurts: I prefer to play them on the couch on my 50" tv
[22:34:33] <systemfault> So... the PC can suck it
[22:34:38] <thathurts> you can play pc games on your couch on your 50" tv
[22:34:44] <coldhead> BLAH BLAH BLAH TURING MACHINES BLAH BLAH BLAH
[22:34:45] <iszak> yep
[22:34:50] <amit_usual> is there a way to get json data from external domain .. getjson will fail because some csrf issue
[22:34:51] <thathurts> just because you're too cheap/lazy to put together the setup, don't blame it on the platform
[22:34:51] <systemfault> ...
[22:34:55] <thathurts> blame it on yourself
[22:34:56] <systemfault> That's not a typical setup.
[22:34:59] <amit_usual> any ideas
[22:35:07] <thathurts> i repeat: just because you're too cheap/lazy to put together the setup, don't blame it on the platform
[22:35:09] <acidjazz> ur mom

[22:36:08] <systemfault> thathurts: Most people don't do that.
[22:36:10] <iszak> thathurts, I guess some people prefer the console controller and worse graphics.
[22:36:12] <zem> hm, do i have to do 'new Request.HTML()' on jsfiddle or can i do $.post()
[22:36:18] <systemfault> thathurts: They buy a wii... and play with the family.
[22:36:25] <thathurts> iszak: and you can use control controllers and wii remotes on your pc
[22:36:45] <thathurts> all i'm saying is that there is NO GAME that you can't play on a pc as well or better than a console
[22:36:57] <iszak> thathurts, also some games only come out on a console COUGH Fable 2
[22:37:09] <thathurts> that's what emulation is for: payback
[22:37:14] <systemfault> iszak: He's going to say that he can emulate.
[22:37:16] <systemfault> iszak: See..
[22:37:22] <systemfault> Typical geek BS.
[22:37:30] <thathurts> it isn't bs
[22:37:31] <systemfault> Nobody "normal" would do it.
[22:37:33] <thathurts> it's reality
[22:37:34] <zem> http://jsfiddle.net/nEED6/
[22:37:35] <iszak> thathurts, there is no good emulator or any for PS3/XBOX 360 last time I checked
[22:37:36] <djQuery> thathurts: actualy the reverse can be said to be true. any game "could be" better on a pc than on a console.
[22:37:50] <djQuery> systemfault: normal sucks
[22:37:59] <GoGoGarrett> Mac is awesome
[22:38:01] <systemfault> djQuery: Normal is most people though.

[22:38:49] <zem> oh, i'm posting to /echo/html/ as suggested in the sidebar
[22:38:50] <iszak> thathurts, I know what you're getting at and personally I would rather get a PC and hook it up to my TV and play games than buy console so I can't understand the rational for console buyers besides that same games only come out on console.
[22:38:51] <systemfault> zem: Ah, thought that you were wondering why $.port wasn't working on jsfiddle..

[22:39:41] <systemfault> What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets! But enough talk, have at you!
[22:39:44] <systemfault> Lulz
[22:39:53] <zem> systemfault: so, no ideas from you why my $.post isn't working?
[22:40:05] <systemfault> zem: Do you have a code or something I can see?
[22:40:12] <zem> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/nEED6/
[22:40:26] <systemfault> zem: It's just a .each :/
[22:40:29] <zem> erm
[22:40:32] <djQuery> zern there is no post in that fiddle
[22:40:35] <zem> do i do an update?
[22:40:39] <djQuery> yes
[22:40:40] <zem> how do i get my codez into the tubes
[22:40:44] <zem> ah, okay
[22:40:45] <zem> try again
[22:40:54] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/nEED6/1/
[22:40:57] <systemfault> His code
[22:41:00] * zem is new to this whole jsfiddle thing
[22:41:11] <coldhead> you'll get the hang of it little buddy!
[22:41:14] <zem> thanks! :)
[22:41:22] <thathurts> look at this
[22:41:23] <thathurts> it's amazing
[22:41:30] <thathurts> here's donkey kong country returns for the wii at 2560x1600
[22:41:31] <thathurts> http://gaaamer.com/images/dkcr.png
[22:41:40] <thathurts> the pc is the best platform for platformers too
[22:42:32] <systemfault> Not sure I get zem's code :/
[22:42:42] <systemfault> Why is he sending html via POST ?
[22:42:51] <gf3> thathurts: I bet these games still suck
[22:42:52] <zem> systemfault: cuz that's how /echo/html/ works
[22:42:52] <djQuery> zem: click on the jslint button
[22:42:52] <gf3> :D
[22:43:29] <thathurts> iszak: the only reason consoles exist is because greedy assholes want to try to control the industry as much as possible and sucker developers into prohibitive licensing agreements
[22:43:30] <systemfault> zem: What is the type of the answer?
[22:43:30] <gf3> coldhead: we should play games or something, since you're doing nothing
[22:43:33] <coldhead> ?w slint
[22:43:38] <bot-t> coldhead, Slint - Slint was an American rock band consisting of Brian McMahan (guitar and vocals), David Pajo (guitar), Britt Walford (drums), Todd Brashear (bass on Spiderland) and Ethan Buckler (bass on Tweez). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slint
[22:43:42] <gf3> coldhead: at some point, not immediately
[22:43:48] <coldhead> lol
[22:43:48] <zem> okay, jslint, good call...those issues fixed
[22:43:53] <systemfault> :D
[22:43:54] <zem> http://jsfiddle.net/nEED6/2/
[22:43:57] <zem> still doesn't do dick though :)
[22:44:00] <coldhead> i am down for that, gf3
[22:44:08] <iszak> gf3, he can't he's running ratpoison
[22:44:13] <thathurts> iszak: i think the thing that pisses me off about consoles the most is how anti-consumer they are. think about it. if you want to watch all the good movies, you just buy any bluray player. that's easy
[22:44:15] <zem> systemfault: "html" :)
[22:44:21] <systemfault> zem: What is the content of "x"
[22:44:21] <coldhead> i wouldn't call my descent into alcoholism "nothing"
[22:44:37] <iszak> thathurts, don't see how that's anti-consumer
[22:44:41] <zem> systemfault: should be the result of the ajax
[22:44:54] <thathurts> iszak: want to play all the good games? you have to buy three "bluray players" because there are no standards and nintendo, microsoft, and sony all want developers to pay licensing fees for the privilege of developing on their shitty closed platforms
[22:44:56] <gf3> coldhead: we should play games or something, since you're doing a thing
[22:45:11] <thathurts> video games are like the betamax/vhs era of home video
[22:45:20] <systemfault> zem: I don't know if jQuery does magic in the background but perhaps you're trying a selector on a string and not nodes.
[22:45:21] <thathurts> if you want to watch every good movie, you have to have multiplayer players
[22:45:22] <iszak> thathurts, ah yeah
[22:45:23] <thathurts> it's fucking stupid
[22:45:27] <systemfault> zem: That could be that.
[22:45:35] <coldhead> thanks gf3
[22:45:40] <thathurts> it's so anti-consumer and so annoying that i can't believe the public hasn't rejected it yet
[22:45:44] <coldhead> my god guiness is delicious
[22:45:52] <iszak> ew guiness
[22:45:52] <coldhead> then later, chimay
[22:46:07] <systemfault> zem: Try to create real nodes from the markup before applying selectors on it.
[22:46:11] <gf3> coldhead: also, come to Canada, I'll take you out for Mexican food, and you won't question the authenticity
[22:46:16] <gf3> (or I'll refuse to pay)
[22:46:16] <zem> hm.  in my local code (which does a 'get', but otherwise should be identical), the append_line function works to append blerb, not blah
[22:46:33] <lazyPower> coldhead: add some baileys and Jameson and you've got one hell of a carbomb.
[22:46:42] <coldhead> i'm just drunk enough to think that a trip to toronto would fix EVERYTHING
[22:46:51] <gf3> lazyPower: or leave it out, and you can enjoy a nice guiness
[22:47:00] <lazyPower> gf3: why would you do that?
[22:47:06] <systemfault> zem: Do you get what I mean?
[22:47:07] <iszak> coldhead, so do it!
[22:47:08] <coldhead> lazyPower: i'm not allowed to drink baileys
[22:47:25] <lazyPower> coldhead: lame :|
[22:47:32] <iszak> I like where lazyPower is going with his alcohol
[22:47:34] <zem> systemfault: yes, i'm just shaving the yak here
[22:47:55] <thathurts> i'm really beginning to wonder if javascript isn't going to become the premiere programming language
[22:47:57] <zem> the real problem is something else, this problem is just trying to get jsfiddle to replicate the true behavior of my little code
[22:47:59] <coldhead> you young people make your drinks too complex
[22:48:01] <thathurts> microsoft adopting it for windows 8 apps
[22:48:06] <thathurts> the popularity of the web
[22:48:07] <systemfault> zem: var nodes = $(x); $('.times', nodes).each...
[22:48:08] <gf3> iszak: PS NO U
[22:48:08] <coldhead> my idea of a cocktail is beer from a glass i didn't wash
[22:48:09] <zem> coldhead: that's a common problem with the young people
[22:48:16] <lazyPower> coldhead: is 30 young?
[22:48:22] <coldhead> yes, i'm afraid it is
[22:48:27] <iszak> coldhead, ahahahaha
[22:48:28] <lazyPower> interesting
[22:48:33] * lazyPower scratches his chin
[22:48:41] <lazyPower> well you've made my day
[22:48:42] <iszak> "my idea of a cocktail is beer from a glass I didn't wash" genius
[22:48:43] <coldhead> your young beardless 30 year old chin
[22:48:46] <systemfault> lol
[22:48:52] <systemfault> coldhead: I love that definition
[22:48:53] <lazyPower> bah
[22:49:07] <coldhead> systemfault: it's based on a true story!
[22:49:13] <systemfault> Wee
[22:49:14] <zem> systemfault: nice!
[22:49:16] <systemfault> *ewww
[22:49:26] <zem> systemfault: you saw right through my jsfiddle issues, that was it
[22:49:32] <systemfault> zem: :)
[22:49:37] <zem> tytyty =)
[22:49:45] <systemfault> You're welcome :)
[22:49:53] <thathurts> "i wouldn't put anything with the word letters 'cock' in it in my mouth"
[22:49:59] <iszak> coldhead, how's ruyb/clojure going? got anything you can show me?
[22:50:04] <iszak> s/ruyb/ruby/
[22:50:16] <zem> maybe i should buy some bitcoin so i can send it around
[22:50:20] <systemfault> Ah, coldhead is a clojure guy?
[22:50:31] <coldhead> systemfault: working on it
[22:50:49] <systemfault> Isn't bitcoin having problem these days...
[22:50:50] <zem> i'd only give out like a few cents worth but it's fun to tip people in bitcoin
[22:50:54] <iszak> systemfault, trying and failing, becoming a ruby guy
[22:50:55] <coldhead> iszak: i'll show you some of my 4clojure solutions when i have a moment, they're pretty neat
[22:50:56] <domino14> it seems that pressing the enter button on ie is causing a button on the screen to get clicked
[22:51:13] <zem> bitcoin was created for the purpose of creating problems
[22:51:13] <systemfault> iszak: Nothing's wrong with ruby :P
[22:51:15] <iszak> coldhead, sounds good!
[22:51:16] <gf3> coldhead is the beautiful man that convinced me lisp was a good enough reason to pervert my life with Nu
[22:51:21] <systemfault> iszak: You could try node.js :P
[22:51:25] <thathurts> domino14: usually pressing the enter button will submit the first submit button on the page
[22:51:27] <iszak> I have, didn't like it.
[22:51:31] <coldhead> how's Nu working out, gf3 ?
[22:51:40] <iszak> complete event driven design is too messy for me
[22:51:43] <zem> i tried node.js too, reverted to python/twisted
[22:51:43] <gf3> coldhead: it's different
[22:51:48] <coldhead> :D
[22:51:49] <systemfault> iszak: Ah :D
[22:51:59] <coldhead> different is good
[22:52:02] <zem> truth be told, i just don't like coding in javascript, maybe i'm getting old
[22:52:02] <gf3> coldhead: I managed to get an ObjC runloop going indefinitely
[22:52:05] <iszak> plus node.js needs to grow up a little bit more, some nice frameworks with all the middleware crap.
[22:52:06] <systemfault> I love evented IO :P
[22:52:10] <iszak> I don't want to have to find mysql drivers and shit
[22:52:29] <coldhead> well observed, iszak
[22:52:40] <systemfault> Most of these things already exist afaik
[22:52:47] <iszak> they do, you're right.
[22:52:50] <systemfault> And express while being lightweight is clean
[22:52:58] <iszak> But I want something like Zend Framework in Node.js
[22:53:00] <acidjazz> how do i cancel a running setTimeout
[22:53:03] <acidjazz> like if i store it as something
[22:53:11] <acidjazz> var dongs = setTimeout....
[22:53:14] <acidjazz> delete dongs ?
[22:53:20] <iszak> I want all my modules maintained, don't want to have to hunt for them, don't want to have to worry about them stopping being supported.
[22:53:34] <gf3> iszak: like... rails...
[22:53:36] <systemfault> acidjazz: clearTimeout(dong);
[22:53:40] <iszak> gf3, ya
[22:53:41] <acidjazz> graci
[22:54:01] <iszak> gf3, but even with rails you have to find some things e.g. authentication - it's not so bad.
[22:54:15] <iszak> and express does do a good job at mitigating that problem
[22:54:19] <lazyPower> With rails being the new slice of bread everyone has jumped ship to persue, it will take an act of congress to kill rails.
[22:54:24] <gf3> iszak: but then you come across beautiful things like ActiveRecord
[22:54:35] <domino14> no, im using django
[22:54:35] <iszak> I wouldn't call it beautiful
[22:54:36] <domino14> i dont like ruby
[22:54:37] <lazyPower> *pursue
[22:54:48] <systemfault> I messed with symfony2 lately, it's not bad, the documentation is still lacking though.
[22:55:04] <systemfault> I think it's better than zf1
[22:55:15] <iszak> INFIDEL
[22:55:16] <lazyPower> i would use CI over Symfony
[22:55:17] <systemfault> :(
[22:55:25] * systemfault cries a little
[22:55:25] <iszak> ZF > Symfony, only thing thing Symfony has going for it is admin generator.
[22:55:32] <domino14> does anyone know why  whenever i hit the return button in an IE window, a button's click event gets executed?
[22:55:34] <iszak> which I must admit is damn damn sexy
[22:55:36] <coldhead> activerecord is very beautiful
[22:55:42] <iszak> systemfault, does symfony use like Zend_Log and shit anyway>?
[22:55:47] <iszak> s/does/doesn't/
[22:56:04] <gf3> we use a homebrew PHP framework at work, inspired by both Symfony and ZEND
[22:56:11] <iszak> gf3, you sicken me
[22:56:27] <gf3> PHP is not a good language for writing and using frameworks
[22:56:37] <systemfault> iszak: THey have their own IIRC
[22:56:46] <systemfault> PHP is ugly.
[22:56:49] <iszak> gf3, granted b ut using something like ZF does make it bareable and why reinvent the wheel?
[22:56:52] <systemfault> I use it at work though
[22:57:02] <gf3> iszak: of course!
[22:57:08] <systemfault> I'd use node.js if I could :P
[22:57:09] <gf3> iszak: in fact, it's almost necessary
[22:57:15] <iszak> systemfault, checked the wiki (may have changed since SF2) it uses Zend_logger and Zend_Cache
[22:57:26] <gf3> iszak: it's just nice to have options
[22:57:33] <systemfault> iszak: I never used sf1 so :/
[22:57:47] <iszak> I used to be against the whole idea of frameworks but now I'm like, I'm not stupid, I'm not maintaining the tools I use to build my application, someone else can do that!
[22:58:37] <dismist> someone help please, i am unable to send a $.ajax GET request to a script and receive the output on the page calling the script, it opens a new browser tab and runs the script properly.  however, i want the script to run within a div on the page making the $.ajax request and UPDATE AS THE SCRIPT OUTPUTS
[22:58:50] <gf3> iszak: so you're doing ruby suff now?
[22:58:53] <gf3> *stuff
[22:59:14] <iszak> gf3, nah still in PHP, doing ModX stuff at work, ruby stuff at home, C# stuff at home, abandoned Node.js for now.
[22:59:19] <iszak> also ZF stuff at home
[22:59:24] <gf3> iszak: coo coo
[22:59:33] <iszak> gf3, what about you? PHP stuff still/
[22:59:35] <GoGoGarrett> we're getting into ruby at my work, i enjoy it thus far
[22:59:48] <iszak> GoGoGarrett, yeah I can expect that too!
[22:59:59] <gf3> iszak: you should check out Padrino for a nice little web framework, pretty barebones, but enough features to be comfortable
[23:00:34] <iszak> gf3, I'm not really into light weight, I like large, monolithic frameworks with everything I'll ever need in them e.g. .NET
[23:00:37] <gf3> iszak: I've been working as a Ruby dev for the past ~5 years, but this most recent place is a PHP shop
[23:00:57] <gf3> iszak: I am working on a Titanium app right now, so mostly JS
[23:00:57] <iszak> gf3, must make your cringe and cry at night whilst trying to sleep
[23:01:12] <iszak> I looked into Titanium App, needs maturing again.
[23:01:15] <gf3> iszak: heh, it makes me appreciate good design
[23:01:18] <iszak> Looks promising though.
[23:01:56] <gf3> iszak: indeed, our app is pretty simple, so things are pretty straightforward so far
[23:07:02] <MC_BTay> hey guys
[23:07:16] <MC_BTay> was looking for some help if anyone didn't mind
[23:08:34] <dismist> how do i make the $.ajax function stream the data output from the url argument of the script it is calling, as opposed to just displaying the data when the script is finished running?
[23:09:35] <coldhead> ?ask @ MC_BTay
[23:09:36] <bot-t> MC_BTay, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[23:10:14] <coldhead> i don't think you can, dismist
[23:10:38] <coldhead> the success handler doesn't get called until the transatction is finished
[23:10:54] <coldhead> you probably need websockets or something
[23:19:13] <coldhead> where did ebbyboddy go?
[23:20:05] <GoGoGarrett> hiding :s
[23:20:17] <iszak> from you
[23:20:28] <coldhead> but i showered today!
[23:20:31] <coldhead> twice!
[23:20:36] <coldhead> fine, i'll have another >: |
[23:23:22] <acidjazz> balls on ur faces
[23:23:31] <acidjazz> mt
[23:23:46] <GoGoGarrett> but no really, vim's the best.
[23:24:46] <abjorn> here is something you can't understand...how I could just..kill a maaan
[23:26:52] <m0dmd> uh oh abjorn
[23:26:58] <m0dmd> what's going on man!
[23:27:30] <abjorn> rap music is going on!
[23:28:05] <m0dmd> that's what it is!

[23:36:55] <dunkel2> hello
[23:37:11] <dunkel2> how can i detect the scroll event on the browser window?
[23:37:26] <dunkel2> im trying the $(window).scroll but is not responding :S
