[00:48:50] <gusti> does anyone know how to limit the player to a certain duration in mediaelement.js
[00:48:57] <gusti> say for example play only 20 seconds
[01:02:43] <Whirl3d> Good morning #jquery
[01:03:27] * gusti yes
[01:05:41] <jarco> Hello,  when you start a script with $(function() { why does it work? is saying this the same as saying:  $(document).ready(function(){ ?
[01:06:21] <Whirl3d> almost.
[01:07:23] <jarco> Can you please explain the difference? Or tell me where to read the difference :) ?
[01:08:10] <Cork> Whirl3d: almost?
[01:08:15] <Cork> its exactly the same thing
[01:08:17] <Whirl3d> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4117543/jquery-help-difference-between-domready-and-function
[01:08:23] <Cork> $ forwards them to .ready
[01:08:25] <prefix> err
[01:09:10] <prefix> why does setting display:block on an item that was previously display:none have no effect in firefox?
[01:09:20] <Cork> (function($) {})(jQuery) is another matter though
[01:09:29] <Whirl3d> Cool.
[01:09:47] <Cork> prefix: you need context on that question
[01:09:57] <Cork> what element, and even better; a testcase
[01:10:22] <Cork> cause the statement like that is, pointless to answer cause all you can say is "works fine here"
[01:11:21] <jarco> Thanks for your answers guys. And also thanks for the link. Learned something again. :)
[01:11:39] <prefix> Cork go here and check out the share buttons at the bottom of the page: http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/content/orbital-returns-wonky-remix-new-france facebook / google+ don't work, but twitter does
[01:12:26] <Whirl3d> Sorry I didn't explain what I was thinking by "almost" i got interrupted. Besides, Cork knows best...always.
[01:13:03] <jarco> No problemo, I got my answer in like 30 seconds. Nothing to complain :)
[01:14:26] <Cork> prefix: all i get is normal links that load an external site
[01:15:07] <prefix> Cork I forgot to mention: you need to hover over the twitter, facebook, and google+ buttons
[01:15:42] <Cork> i don't even see a google+ icon
[01:15:59] <prefix> did you scroll down to the bottom area of the page?
[01:16:17] <prefix> where it says "Share This"
[01:16:21] <Cork> Staff Rating System Facebook Twitter <-- ?
[01:16:29] <prefix> no up
[01:16:33] <Cork> ah there
[01:17:28] <Trisox> o/
[01:17:34] <prefix> you see what I mean?
[01:17:36] <Cork> prefix: the g+ script needs to be loaded in a visible element
[01:17:47] <Trisox> Cork
[01:18:01] <Cork> it sets its element to width: 1px height: 0px if you load it in an invisible element
[01:18:21] <prefix> how does this site do it then? http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2013/02/10-free-songs-you-should-download-right-now-37/
[01:18:28] <prefix> check the top buttons
[01:18:49] <prefix> also, this doesn't happen in chrome
[01:20:31] <prefix> Cork ?
[01:21:49] <Cork> prefix: guess they manually reset the values on __plus_0
[01:22:08] <prefix> hm
[01:22:13] <prefix> ok
[01:22:19] <prefix> so what if I use a timeout
[01:22:34] <prefix> set the element to invisible after a second or so
[01:22:38] <Cork> you could set it to display: block; visibility: hidden
[01:22:45] <Cork> or just ignore visibility
[01:22:52] <Cork> and then hide it with jquery on domready
[01:23:22] <Cork> that should be enough to let the script do its thing
[01:23:35] <prefix> is visibility a CSS attribute
[01:23:45] <Liriel> I want to display a multicolumn treeview on my site and was wondering if it's ok to use <OL> instead of <TABLE> on this one to preserve the hierarchical info in the HTML document - would you agree ?
[01:23:55] <Cork> prefix: yes
[01:24:07] <Cork> ?g mdn css visibility
[01:24:08] <b-ot> Cork: visibility - CSS | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/visibility
[01:24:09] <bot-t> Cork, visibility - CSS | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/visibility
[01:24:25] <brantje> lol
[01:24:29] <brantje> 2 bots here
[01:24:54] <Cork> Liriel: you would have to use ul, li and in that one put a table if you want to do that
[01:25:03] <Cork> not sure if table is valid inside li's though
[01:25:17] <Cork> Liriel: but its not valid to have ol as parent for tr if thats what you mean
[01:25:27] <Liriel> Cork: could i get the tbale look with CSS ?
[01:25:36] <Cork> sure
[01:25:58] <Liriel> does it work in all browsers ?
[01:26:04] <Cork> but you would have to create aprox the same amount of elements in the tree
[01:26:05] <Cork> ya
[01:26:14] <raj> hola Cork ;)
[01:26:37] <Liriel> the reason for this is drag & drop works really nice if I have the hierarchy in HTML
[01:26:44] <Cork> display: table/table-row/table-cell
[01:28:02] <Cork> Liriel: be sure to make a static html file and validate it before you start though
[01:28:15] <brantje> Cork
[01:28:24] <Cork> <_<'
[01:28:28] <Liriel> ok I will :)
[01:28:36] <brantje> Are <li id="2342"> << Is this allowed?
[01:28:42] <Liriel> Cork: thx for the advice!
[01:28:49] <brantje> Want to build a sortable list by id
[01:28:58] <Cork> Trisox, raj: wllo
[01:29:00] <Cork> *ello
[01:29:08] <Cork> brantje: yes
[01:29:48] <Trisox> hey Cork
[01:29:58] <brantje> thanks :)
[01:30:12] <raj> Soo freaking hungry
[01:30:21] <brantje> hehe
[01:30:32] <Cork> raj: i'm made of wood, so i'm not tasty
[01:30:33] <brantje> finally i fixed my bug
[01:30:45] <vladikoff> ?validid @ brantje
[01:30:46] <bot-t> brantje, ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[01:30:48] <b-ot> brantje: ID attributes must begin with a letter ( [A-Za-z] ) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ( [0-9] ), hyphens ( "-" ), underscores ( "_" ), colons ( ":" ), and periods ( "." ). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[01:31:00] <raj> I dunno, my wood tastes good
[01:31:06] <raj> or so I'm told
[01:31:08] <raj> =P
[01:31:08] <brantje> do i read double xD
[01:31:14] <Cork> vladikoff: thats old pre html5
[01:31:23] <Cork> vladikoff: html5 allows most anything in id's
[01:31:42] <Cork> except for # and .
[01:31:54] <raj> Cork, what do you think of this solution to recursively collecting nested ul/li's as json --> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3172775/jquery-tree-traversal-nested-unordered-list-elements-to-json
[01:32:16] <raj> *for recursively collecting
[01:33:02] <iko30> hello, i have a problem in ie9: <?
[01:33:02] <iko30> header( 'Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate' );
[01:33:02] <iko30> header( 'Pragma: no-cache' );
[01:33:05] <iko30> ?>wrong
[01:33:06] <Cork> raj: ya, thats somewhat how i would do it
[01:33:08] <bot-t> iko30, #6724 (wrong $(window).height() in mobile safari (iphone)) – jQuery ... - Opened 8 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6724
[01:33:36] <iko30> http://mancave.oxwall.se/~alex/sajax/index2.php - wont work in ie9 before i press F5 to reload the page...
[01:33:53] <Cork> iko30: wrong channel
[01:33:56] <Cork> you want ##php
[01:34:45] <raj> Cork, something I've never understood is creating a jquery plugin
[01:34:49] <raj> or extension
[01:34:50] <raj> or whatever
[01:34:59] <raj> so I can create a method that acts on a jquery object
[01:35:08] <raj> $('#selector').doMyFunction()
[01:35:28] <iko30> Cork: no, thanks. its a ajax-method that is the problem
[01:35:33] <raj> is there a simple read for that?
[01:36:04] <Cork> raj: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[01:36:25] <Cork> theres prob hundreds more
[01:36:25] <prefix> Cork visibility:hidden isn't working for the google plus element
[01:36:41] <Cork> prefix: no i mean set it on your element instead of display:none
[01:36:59] <prefix> Cork yes, that is what I am soing
[01:37:01] <Cork> prefix: the problem is, that when the script creates the element, the parent has to have a size
[01:37:19] <Cork> else you get size on the created element
[01:37:33] <prefix> so I should probably just set it manually then
[01:37:46] <Cork> prefix: try display:block; in css
[01:37:55] <Cork> does the script work then?
[01:38:04] <Cork> if you don't do the visibility or anything
[01:38:16] <prefix> yes
[01:38:17] <raj> Cork, this is lovely, thanks!
[01:38:18] <Cork> (and don't hide it with js)
[01:38:24] <raj> how have I not seen this before
[01:38:34] <Cork> prefix: and if you run $('selector').hide() in $(function() {})
[01:38:36] <prefix> Cork the google one will not hide when I set visibility:hidden
[01:38:39] <Cork> prefix: does that break it?
[01:39:01] <prefix> sec
[01:39:50] <gusti> is there any player that would let me allow a preview of the song like play for a certain seconds only
[01:40:37] <prefix> Cork if I do it on document load, it does not work
[01:40:59] <Cork> hmm so even thats too early :s
[01:41:04] <Cork> that kinda suck
[01:41:16] <Cork> that means the script creates it async
[01:41:19] <prefix> yes, I agree
[01:41:24] <Cork> and then you can't predict when its stable
[01:41:33] <prefix> sec
[01:41:36] <prefix> I might be able to fix that
[01:42:43] <gusti> ?
[01:43:23] <prefix> Cork yes, even if I uncheck async it still creates it after doc load
[01:43:48] <Cork> prefix: doc load or doc ready?
[01:43:56] <prefix> not sure
[01:44:12] <Cork> $(document).load or $(document).ready ?
[01:44:26] <Cork> last is the same as $(function() {})
[01:44:46] <prefix> https://developers.google.com/+/plugins/+1button/
[01:45:22] <Cork> i mean when are you trying to hide it?
[01:45:35] <prefix> $(document).ready(function () {
[01:46:53] <Whirl3d> jarco, I found this that explains WHY $(function () {}); is equivalent to $.ready(function () {}); and $(document).ready(function () {});   really well... I never really thought about it like this before: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[01:47:12] <Cork> prefix: you could try the Explicit render option
[01:47:40] <prefix> what's it do?
[01:48:31] <jarco> thx Whirl3d
[01:48:49] <Cork> prefix: on the page you linked to search for "Explicit render"
[01:48:55] <Cork> its down in the example section
[01:51:30] <prefix> hm
[01:51:31] <prefix> no dice
[01:52:00] <Cork> prefix: even if you run it when you show dropdown=
[01:52:02] <Cork> *?
[01:52:40] <raj> Cork, actually, there's something I don't like about that script
[01:52:53] <raj> ...the recursive jsonifier
[01:53:02] <prefix> Cork dropdown =?
[01:53:17] <Cork> prefix: the element you slide out
[01:53:27] <prefix> oh yeah
[01:53:32] <raj> I want it all to be nested arrays, I think
[01:53:39] <prefix> I just have to rehide it after 800ms though
[01:53:40] <prefix> it sucks
[01:53:52] <Cork> prefix: that won't work
[01:53:57] <prefix> why?
[01:54:01] <raj> I'm not sure if order totally matters
[01:54:03] <Cork> if anyone hits network latency your page will break
[01:54:07] <raj> but just in case it does, I should use arrays I think
[01:54:09] <prefix> oh fantastic
[01:54:15] <Cork> you can't fix async with a timer
[01:54:31] <Cork> you need to make it predictive
[01:54:33] <prefix> that's really great news
[01:54:42] <Cork> and by controlling when it is parsed you should be able to do that
[01:54:56] <lejocelyn> hey
[01:55:10] <lejocelyn> is it ok to write this  : $newAttr = $(this).parent("div").attr("class") + "_" + number;
[01:55:28] <Cork> raj: it creates array of objects, so you get order
[01:55:41] <Cork> lejocelyn: not really
[01:55:53] <Cork> it expects class to only contain one class
[01:56:09] <Cork> your better of storing that in a data- attribute
[01:56:38] <lejocelyn> Cork: example ?
[01:57:08] <Cork> <div data-what_ever_name_you_choose="some_prefix">
[01:57:32] <lejocelyn> Cork: is it HTML compliant ? I didn't know the attribute data
[01:57:38] <Cork> $(this).parent().data('what_ever_name_you_choose') + number;
[01:57:41] <Cork> lejocelyn: yes
[01:57:52] <Cork> data- is a reserved namespace in attributes
[01:57:52] <lejocelyn> ok, so I'm not HTML compliant ;)
[01:58:09] <Cork> lejocelyn: it is compliant
[01:58:13] <Cork> its in the spec
[01:58:18] <lejocelyn> I believe you
[01:58:45] <Alarm> hello , i used a progressbar for my application but have some issues.  i use in my ajax call a "async : false," property for the request. the problem is that the bar reaches within seconds to 100% while i see in my console that there are still requests posted on the server for several minutes
[01:59:01] <Cork> lejocelyn: http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/elements.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes
[01:59:17] <lejocelyn> Cork: thanks
[01:59:27] <Cork> lejocelyn: also i think you miss what parent() does
[01:59:47] <Cork> parent('div') will return the parent element if its a div; else it will return nothing
[01:59:50] <Alarm> any ideas ?
[01:59:54] <Cork> it won't look futher up the chain
[02:00:04] <Cork> lejocelyn: i suspect you really want closest instead
[02:00:10] <lejocelyn> Cork: it's exactly what I want actually
[02:00:27] <lejocelyn> the closest wouln't match
[02:00:36] <Cork> but it will crash if the parent isn't a div
[02:00:39] <granden> Does anyone know of a nice jquery plugin that would fill an entire div with an <video> element?  By scaling it. And also works on resize of window/div?
[02:00:56] <granden> tried videoBG but did not work as I would like.
[02:01:06] <Cork> lejocelyn: <div><span><b> parent('div') on b will return nothing
[02:01:23] <Cork> lejocelyn: <div><span><b> closest('div') on b will return the div
[02:01:42] <lejocelyn> hum, I didn't know the member closest
[02:01:48] <Cork> ?.closest
[02:01:57] <Cork> BAH, and the bot is down again...
[02:02:10] <Cork> lejocelyn: http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[02:02:32] <Cork> "For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree."
[02:02:56] <Cork> parent just tests parentNode
[02:03:06] <Cork> and if that fails returns nothing
[02:03:16] <Cork> no traversal
[02:04:21] <lejocelyn> but it works still for my code
[02:04:50] <lejocelyn> as the button's parent is the div
[02:09:23] <granden> I would like a video like the one found here, https://www.spotify.com/se/video-splash/?utm_source=spotify&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=start how have they done that? Filling the complete screen and scalesit nice as well.
[02:11:31] <Kasimir> Granden: you could use a frame maximage2 for example
[02:11:41] <Kasimir> Granden: http://www.aaronvanderzwan.com/maximage/examples/html5video.html
[02:14:55] <Lucky--> LOL much needed new feature in the early access preview of jetbrains' web storm. http://i.imgur.com/rQJDvBs.png. I was liek 'is there soemthing wrong with my code?' then I looked at it.
[02:18:30] <raj> Cork, http://paste.ofcode.org/375MwmfZymvDBvSZ6ckBukU ?
[02:18:53] <Cork> raj: $(document).ready(function() { shouldn't be there
[02:19:06] <raj> function($) ensures the document is ready?
[02:19:11] <Cork> no
[02:19:26] <Cork> but the call to makeJSON would happen in something that does
[02:20:02] <raj> k
[02:22:47] <vicary> hi, as of jQuery UI 1.10, tabs seems ignoring the "title" attribute in <a> tag to match a DOM id for it's panel. Is this intended?
[02:23:03] <raj> Cork, http://paste.ofcode.org/qZicK6ZgjVGNwEN24J4kJH ?
[02:23:54] <Cork> raj: ya, that looks about right
[02:26:44] <vicary> I mean when you need both #div and ajax content, ui 1.8 will use title when href is an url.
[02:28:10] <vicary> And as of 1.10 it seems just ignores the title, any1?
[02:30:12] <raj> Cork, is `$(this)` supposed to be wrapped in the $() as it is in lines 17 and 24?
[02:30:20] <lejocelyn> it should be alright this code ? on a syntaxical level : $clone = $("ul li:last, '.'+$items").clone(); N
[02:30:31] <lejocelyn>  s/N//
[02:30:41] <Lucky--> shrug, how i know im tired, im writing typescript in a javascript editor window trying to debug it wondering why all the errors wont go away.
[02:30:41] <Cork> raj: this is the same as $(this) in a plugin
[02:30:56] <raj> but it said not to uneccessarily wrap
[02:31:14] <raj> so I don't need $(this) is what you're saying
[02:31:26] <Cork> yes
[02:31:53] <raj> k, thank you
[02:33:12] <lejocelyn> this : $("'.'+$items ul li:last") or this : $("ul li:last, '.'+$items") is the same ?
[02:38:04] <Cork> lejocelyn: that selector makes no sense
[02:38:08] <Cork> its all invalid
[02:38:32] <lejocelyn> I still don't get how to use variables inside a selector
[02:38:33] <Cork> whats $items?
[02:38:38] <Cork> you can't
[02:38:42] <lejocelyn> a class
[02:38:44] <raj> Cork, sorry to keep troubling you with this little script, this is what I've ended up with http://paste.ofcode.org/3376yCWynbYjx9HXGm2cDsP
[02:38:46] <Cork> a string?
[02:38:52] <lejocelyn> yes a string
[02:39:14] <Cork> '.' + $items + 'ul li').last()
[02:39:19] <Cork> * $('.' + $items + 'ul li').last()
[02:40:07] <lejocelyn> ok, but I could also use the pseudo class :last ?
[02:40:34] <lejocelyn> like this $('.' + $items + 'ul li:last')
[02:40:42] <Cork> well its not a psudo class
[02:40:53] <Cork> its a psudo call that makes jquery call .last()
[02:40:56] <Cork> but its slower
[02:41:05] <lejocelyn> ok
[02:41:07] <Cork> quite a bit slower too
[02:41:23] <Cork> so only use : selectors if you can't use the native function calls
[02:41:35] <Cork> (you can only give a plugin a string selector or something like that)
[02:41:51] <lejocelyn> thanks a lot
[02:46:21] <jarco> Is there a standard for validation in jquery? Like, are most people using the same plugin? Or is another approach recommended?
[02:46:44] <Cork> jarco: jquery.validator is very common
[02:47:08] <Cork> but no theres no recommendations as far as i know
[02:47:20] <jarco> this one? http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[02:47:39] <Cork> yes
[02:47:52] <jarco> I am stugling with it for the last two hours :)
[02:48:33] <raj> Cork,
[02:48:34] <raj> it's broken
[02:48:45] <raj> cuz it's looking for children that are 'li'
[02:48:47] <raj> but there are none
[02:48:54] <raj> oh wait, yes there are
[02:49:13] <Cork> raj: i didn't not validate the selectors in that snippet
[02:49:24] <Cork> you would have to verify that your self
[02:49:35] <Cork> i just checked so the code flow was reasonable
[02:51:34] <jarco> Its hard to figure out validation when the examples are not working ... http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/radio-checkbox-select-demo.html
[02:54:42] <Cork> jarco: i think that demo is outdated
[02:54:46] <Cork> check http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation#demo
[02:56:09] <jarco> Thanks
[02:56:23] <jarco> I was looking there but its not very easy for beginners :)
[02:56:30] <jarco> But I will manage
[02:57:42] <jarco> Is it possible that html5 required is preventing this plugin from doing its work?
[02:58:23] <brantje> How do i check if .msg exists in .mycont-2?
[02:59:00] <djQuery> jarco, I thought I saw were the validation plugin just had a new version that did more html5 stuff

[03:01:20] <ganeshu> there are xmpp, strophie.js and long polling ajax calls, it is relevant with jquery
[03:01:57] <djQuery> ganeshu, no its not,   I am getting an error when doing X is on topic
[03:02:03] <Cork> brantje: $('.mycont-2 .msg').length > 0
[03:03:32] <raj> Cork, the difference in my ul/li structure is that any "li" that would potentionally have children, it'll instead be a ul
[03:04:02] <Cork> raj: you could try find('ul > li')
[03:04:22] <Cork> hmm no that will jump too
[03:04:48] <ganeshu> djQuery:  if it is in ur way..then IRC this channel is waste,
[03:05:01] <Cork> raj: you could try find('> ul > li')
[03:05:05] <djQuery> raj, so what about li>ul
[03:05:39] <djQuery> ganeshu, link?
[03:06:43] <Yngvar> Hi, iksik!
[03:08:05] <raj> Cork, for which line?
[03:08:18] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/3bUJf2k87kLazQaWyvCMJ9R
[03:08:27] <Cork> raj: the one looping in the process function
[03:10:24] <djQuery> raj, are you just trying to loop through the upper most ul and get all the lis recursevely?
[03:11:18] <raj> i'll just make a fiddle
[03:11:55] <Cork> use the plugin in it, that would make things a lot easier
[03:14:32] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/gvQvh/
[03:14:36] <raj> use the plugin in what?
[03:14:51] <raj> oh, in the fiddle
[03:15:02] <raj> yes, I did
[03:16:11] <djQuery> raj, so it looks like it is only grabing a single level right now
[03:16:25] <raj> ya
[03:16:37] <raj> cuz the next level has ul's and li's at the same level
[03:18:03] <djQuery> so just call it on it self inside the loop
[03:18:45] <raj> call what on self?
[03:19:01] <raj> and s/self/this ?
[03:19:05] <djQuery> no
[03:19:12] <raj> can you show in the fiddle
[03:19:17] <raj> por favor
[03:19:23] <iksik> Yngvar: hi
[03:19:35] <djQuery> raj,
[03:19:36] <djQuery> http://javascript.about.com/library/blrecursive.htm
[03:20:34] <raj> yes, I'm aware what recursive means
[03:21:44] <Yngvar> iksik: did you figure out what was wrong with that first script I sent you saturday?
[03:22:55] <iksik> Yngvar: hmmm, to be honest, i don't remember ;P
[03:26:27] <Yngvar> iksik: I wouldn't too :) I've sent you this, but with that line uncommented http://jsfiddle.net/gXcCG/2
[03:29:43] <Yngvar> iksik: what is puzzling me is why that commented line prevents the passing of the extra argument
[03:31:01] <iksik> Yngvar: but why You need to focus that field?
[03:31:17] <iksik> if you are 'bluring' it just after that
[03:33:30] <Yngvar> iksik: I don't need to, but IRL I'll blur the field when it's focused by the user
[03:35:21] <Yngvar> so I put the focus to simulate that, and ended with the same strange behavior that's happening in the real code, but I don't trigger focus there
[03:37:46] <Yngvar> all the other samples I wrote after this (which are more close to the real code) work flawlessly
[03:38:45] <Yngvar> I hope that understanding why that first sample doesn't work will help me understand why the code I'm working on doesn't work
[03:43:42] <inad922> hello
[03:44:38] <inad922> I'm adding a click event listener for a button inside a form. But when i click it it gets submitted. Even if I call event.preventDefault in the event handler func. Could someone help me out on this?>
[03:45:10] <iksik> Yngvar: http://jsfiddle.net/gXcCG/4/ - what about that one?
[03:45:45] <iksik> Yngvar: uhh, sorry, '!' is still there, nvm
[03:45:46] <iksik> ;P
[03:46:25] <iksik> Yngvar: http://jsfiddle.net/gXcCG/5/ this one
[03:48:55] <DashCC> Good day, does anybody have problems with jquery in the latest firefox (18)?
[03:49:22] <DashCC> My page breaks although it did work great before that new version
[03:49:34] <DashCC> *before that new browser version
[03:50:23] <tlkr> is it working in chrome?
[03:51:48] <Cork> DashCC: can't say i've had any problems with it
[03:52:05] <Cork> DashCC: do you get any error logged?
[03:52:16] <Cork> and what part is it that breaks?
[03:52:26] <DashCC> yes I get $ is not defined
[03:52:50] <Cork> so the resource isn't loaded
[03:53:01] <Cork> where are you including jquery in the document?
[03:53:02] <DashCC> I looked at the GET Request
[03:53:14] <DashCC> its fully loaded and returns a 200 OK
[03:53:16] <Yngvar> iksik: that works too, but the field never get focus :P
[03:53:25] <Cork> DashCC: what content type?
[03:53:39] <Yngvar> I got another example that doesn't work, without triggering focus
[03:54:27] <DashCC> Cork: its the usual, I just dont understand why it is breaking now. The page has worked for years without a hitch
[03:55:18] <Cork> DashCC: 1. the content type should be text/javascript or application/javascript; 2. it might be your loading it fine into the page; but your doing it too late
[03:55:38] <Cork> just cause its loaded doesn't mean its loaded early enough
[03:55:49] <DashCC> but I didnt change anything, I even checked out older commits so that I can check
[03:55:55] <DashCC> its the first js file
[03:56:00] <Cork> they might have fixed a bug in the parser or something
[03:56:20] <Cork> that made your code that assumed the broken behavior break
[03:56:37] <Cork> without seeing how its loaded, and how its referenced, its not possible to tell what it is
[03:56:47] <DashCC> but something like $ is not defined? I mean I consider myself very proficient in javascript :-)
[03:56:48] <Cork> it might be a bug in the browser too
[03:57:01] <Cork> DashCC: it just means the variable isn't defined yet
[03:57:11] <Cork> its not that big a mystery
[03:57:15] <DashCC> yes well, jquery gets loaded in the head
[03:57:29] <DashCC> and the line of script where it says it errors
[03:57:33] <DashCC> is in $(function()
[03:57:40] <Cork> DashCC: what i meant was: either reproduce it with a fiddle
[03:57:45] <Cork> or a link
[03:57:46] <Yngvar> iksik: this is almost what happens in my code http://jsfiddle.net/gXcCG/6/ (click on the field and type a letter)
[03:57:50] <Cork> talking about it won't help anyone
[03:58:36] <Yngvar> and I say almost because the problem occurs with a div with tabindex focused, not a field
[04:07:04] <iksik> Yngvar: ok, now.. why i need to pass this argument using blur event?
[04:08:17] <Yngvar> iksik: because sometimes I need to change focus from one element to another without triggering their event handlers
[04:09:25] <txdv> what is the difference between $('.gamechat table tr:eq(1)').attr('class') and $('.gamechat table tr')[1].attr('class')
[04:09:42] <Cork> txdv: the last one doesn't work
[04:09:42] <txdv> the later says HTMLTableRowElement has no method 'attr'
[04:09:59] <Yngvar> iksik: hmm... maybe if I disable the blur event handler after setting focus and reenable it later...
[04:10:04] <Cork> txdv: $('.gamechat table tr').eq(1).attr('class') doesn't though
[04:10:17] <Cork> txdv: [] returns the native dom element
[04:10:23] <Cork> without the jquery wrapper
[04:10:43] <txdv> Hm, seams reasonable, thanks
[04:15:28] <Cork> txdv: btw .eq() is preferable over :eq()
[04:15:52] <Cork> .eq does the same thing, but the speed difference it quite large
[04:16:02] <txdv> parsing text and stuff
[04:16:22] <Cork> not really, its more of the internals of sizzle
[04:16:43] <Cork> its how the functions needs to be called if they are used with :
[04:17:52] <jarco> The validate plugin actually requires invalid html?
[04:17:54] <Yngvar> iksik: ops... I meant "before changing focus"
[04:18:12] <Cork> jarco: invalid?
[04:18:17] <jarco> Cork, minlength="5" in example is validated as an error
[04:18:29] <jarco> Attribute minlength not allowed on element input at this point.
[04:18:58] <Cork> jarco: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/Input
[04:19:08] <Cork>  maxlength HTML5
[04:19:08] <Cork>     If the value of the type attribute is text, email,search, password, tel, or url, this attribute specifies the maximum number of characters (in Unicode code points) that the user can ente
[04:19:13] <Cork> so, nope not invalid
[04:19:22] <Cork> as long as your using the html doctype
[04:19:48] <jarco> my doctype is <!DOCTYPE html>
[04:19:56] <Cork> then its valid
[04:19:57] <jarco> w3c validator makes an error out of ut
[04:20:01] <jarco> it*
[04:20:27] <Cork> its validation is experimental, apparently its not updated for input fields
[04:20:32] <Cork> interesting, didn't know that
[04:20:51] <jarco> Now we know.
[04:20:53] <jarco> Thanks again
[04:20:57] <Cork> np
[04:21:34] <Cork> jarco: what element type are you using it on?
[04:21:37] <Cork> input?
[04:21:52] <ohcibi> maxlength is supported though.. strange
[04:22:12] <Cork> depends on the element
[04:22:26] <Cork> its valid on input fields, but not all form elements
[04:22:31] <drag0nius> how can i get size of rendered background-image ?
[04:22:36] <ohcibi> Cork: i just made a quick test with a text input, just because i was curious
[04:22:40] <jarco> Cork, input
[04:22:53] <jarco> <input type ="text" name="name" id="naam" placeholder="Voornaam en naam" class="required tekst" minlength="5" />
[04:22:54] <Cork> drag0nius: you can't
[04:22:55] <banisterfiend> hi, how do i move a div to the middle of the screen? i currently have:         $('#sidebar').css({marginLeft: '500px'});
[04:23:06] <banisterfiend> but i'd prefer if i can repalce '500px' with 'middle of screen'
[04:23:13] <drag0nius> so i'd have to set it manually after each edit?
[04:23:21] <Cork> banisterfiend: margin: auto;
[04:23:35] <banisterfiend> Cork: i mean just middle on x not on y
[04:23:35] <jarco> banisterfiend, margin: 0 auto;
[04:23:37] <Cork> bandroidx: only works for horizontal though
[04:23:43] <banisterfiend> jarco: thanks, but that did not seem to work when i tried it
[04:23:45] <banisterfiend> i'll try again now
[04:23:51] <Cork> bandroidx: thats margin: auto;
[04:23:59] <jarco> only works on block elements if i remember correctly
[04:24:01] <jarco> i ll check
[04:24:01] <Cork> the 0 doens't matter you can't center verticaly
[04:24:08] <banisterfiend> jarco: how do i do that with jquery?
[04:24:21] <banisterfiend> jarco: css{margin: "0 auut0"} ?
[04:24:24] <banisterfiend> auto
[04:24:26] <Cork> bandroidx: $('target').css('margin', 'auto')
[04:24:39] <ohcibi> jarco: I made a similar test where it gives a list of allowed attributes in this context... maxlength is listed, minlength not... so maybe the spec really disallow minlength on input??
[04:24:45] <ohcibi> (type=text)
[04:24:45] <jarco> $("#randomdiv").css("margin","0 auto");
[04:25:05] <banisterfiend> Cork: ah so in my case it woudl be 'margin', '0', 'auto'    ? however how do i tell it to *just keep the current top margin the same* ?
[04:25:20] <Cork> banisterfiend: no ignore the 0
[04:25:23] <Cork> it doesn't do anything
[04:25:28] <jarco> banisterfiend, The way i did it is correct
[04:25:35] <Cork> just do ('margin', 'auto')
[04:25:45] <jarco> oh
[04:25:46] <jarco> treu
[04:25:48] <jarco> true
[04:26:05] <jarco> i put it in there in case I wan't to change the margin top-bottom
[04:26:11] <jarco> :)
[04:26:19] <banisterfiend> thanks
[04:26:25] <Cork> or css({ 'margin-left': 'auto', 'margin-right': 'auto' })
[04:26:30] <jarco> ohcibi, I do not know, Cork said it was allowed
[04:26:31] <Cork> if you don't want to affect the top and bottom margin
[04:26:47] <Cork> so => css({ 'margin-left': 'auto', 'margin-right': 'auto' })
[04:26:55] <ohcibi> jarco: cant see a minlength here: http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/forms.html#the-input-element
[04:27:05] <banisterfiend> Cork: wait so it's called "margin-left" ? not marginLeft ?
[04:27:07] <ohcibi> Cork: are you *sure* that minlength is allowed in input type=text?
[04:27:19] <Cork> banisterfiend: marginLeft: or 'margin-left':
[04:27:22] <jarco> to many tabs on my 256 mb ram :)
[04:27:24] <Cork> both work
[04:27:40] <banisterfiend> Cork: hmm, neither of those work for me, i have to explicitly set it at 500px for anything to happen, otherwise it doesnt move
[04:27:46] <banisterfiend> 'auto' doesn't move it
[04:27:51] <ohcibi> jarco: the whole html5 forms document doesnt contain the string "minlength"
[04:28:20] <ohcibi> seems its not even a real attribute 8-)
[04:28:34] <Cork> ohcibi: http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/input#HTML_Attributes
[04:28:55] <jarco> well, that brings me back to my original question. Why does the validate plugin make us do it this way. :)
[04:28:59] <ohcibi> Cork: there is no "minlength" on this page
[04:29:09] <Cork> ah... minlength...
[04:29:14] <Cork> i read it as maxlength >_<'
[04:29:14] <ohcibi> jarco: i found a so-answer that talks about "pattern"
[04:29:18] <ohcibi> Cork: 8-)))
[04:29:32] <Cork> no minlength isn't valid....
[04:29:33] <ohcibi> jarco: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10281962/is-it-minlength-in-html5
[04:29:44] <jarco> banisterfiend, i am making an example for you
[04:29:49] <chilversc_> well, the other interesting thing about the html spec is that adding your own attributes isn't actually invalid, just not recommended
[04:30:11] <ohcibi> chilversc_: we all know were this would lead to 8)
[04:30:18] <banisterfiend> jarco: thanks, but what do you think is wrong with my setup such that only an explicit marginLeft: 500px  appears to move the sidebar, if i just have marginLeft: auto, it doesn't get moved
[04:30:25] <Cork> chilversc: its highly not recommended
[04:31:06] <Cork> chilversc: i've seen plenty of situations where page breaks, cause a browser implements a new feature
[04:31:13] <Cork> and a page used the attribute for that feature
[04:31:14] <chilversc_> though I'm glad they realised how useful it can be and gave us the data- prefix
[04:31:21] <Cork> and it now don't return a string...
[04:31:24] <Cork> *opps*
[04:31:33] <jarco> banisterfiend, http://jsfiddle.net/5JcyW/
[04:31:40] <Cork> chilversc: ya, thats exactly why it was implemented
[04:32:11] <banisterfiend> jarco: thanks, however i can do it fine with css
[04:32:19] <banisterfiend> jarco: it's when i use jquery to do it that it doesnt work :(
[04:32:24] <jarco> ohw its the jquery that is not working :)
[04:32:31] <banisterfiend> yeah i'll show u my code
[04:32:37] <jarco> are you changing the display with jquery?
[04:32:51] <burg> hello. when i make an ajax request to a json file, internet explorer asks me if i want to save that file. is this normal? in any other browsers i can read data from that json
[04:32:59] <banisterfiend> jarco: https://gist.github.com/4977048
[04:33:15] <banisterfiend> jarco: lines 3-4
[04:33:21] <banisterfiend> jarco: but i change the 500px to 'auto'
[04:33:23] <banisterfiend> it doesnt move it at all
[04:33:31] <jarco> btw banisterfiend  i am beginner in jquery. So I hope someone else also watches with us :)
[04:33:38] <banisterfiend> ah :)
[04:33:40] <banisterfiend> np
[04:34:47] <Cork> burg: do your server know what json is?
[04:35:03] <Cork> burg: the mimetype needs to be application/json
[04:35:07] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: $("document") <--- won't work... there is no element whichs name is "document"... what you want to do is $(document)... but you can shorten it to just $(function() { /** code belongs inhere **/});
[04:35:50] <Cork> banisterfiend: to center the element you need to use margin on both sides
[04:35:58] <Cork> just left won't help
[04:36:19] <banisterfiend> ohcibi: thanks (however changing it appears to make 0 differnece, but stil lit's good to know :D)
[04:36:33] <banisterfiend> Cork: ah, so how would i do it?
[04:36:39] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: i dont know what the difference should be 8-)
[04:36:52] <Cork> $('#sidebar').css({marginLeft: "500px", marginRight: "500px"});
[04:36:57] <Cork> opps
[04:37:04] <Cork> $('#sidebar').css({marginLeft: "auto", marginRight: "auto"});
[04:37:09] <banisterfiend> Cork: thanks
[04:37:10] <burg> Cork, http://pastie.org/6211924 - these are the headers as i see them in chrome's web inspector
[04:37:17] <burg> for the same ajax request
[04:37:26] <txdv> how do I hook the onclick event on a link('a')?
[04:37:33] <Cork> burg: how are you loading it?
[04:37:46] <Cork> burg: sounds like your using something like a link, and your triggering a page reload
[04:37:53] <banisterfiend> Cork: thanks howver that didnt work either :(
[04:37:59] <Cork> you might need event.preventDefault()
[04:38:07] <banisterfiend> Cork:    $('#sidebar').css({marginLeft: "auto", marginRight: "auto"});
[04:38:16] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: the last parameter of animate is a reference to a function... by saying "functionname(value)" you are executing that function (leaving the return value of the function as function-reference for the complete-callback) which makes no sense.. so you always do "funcName" without ()
[04:38:19] <Cork> banisterfiend: could you make a jsfiddle for your code?
[04:38:25] <txdv> nevermind
[04:38:33] <burg> Cork, i make an ajax request to that link, then: ajax.done(function(response) { /* here i work with response object */ })
[04:38:57] <Cork> burg: are you aborting the original request?
[04:39:01] <chilversc_> burg: which version of IE?
[04:39:16] <banisterfiend> ohcibi: thanks
[04:39:20] <burg> chilversc_, ie9. i have yet to try other versions too
[04:39:34] <burg> Cork, why should i abort the original request?
[04:39:44] <Cork> burg: the link you click
[04:39:58] <Cork> as you want to use ajax, then you don't want the original request to go through
[04:40:14] <burg> Cork, yes, of course. anyway the link goes to # anyway
[04:40:34] <Cork> ah... another broken link site *sigh*
[04:40:38] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: if you like to pass "link" as a parameter, i would pass a function that executes your "getPageAndRender" with the link as parameter so.. .animate(...., function() { getPageAndRender(link); }));
[04:40:59] <Cork> burg: anyway, try reproducing it with just the ajax call
[04:41:04] <banisterfiend> ohcibi: nice, thanks
[04:41:08] <Cork> preferably a static html file
[04:41:25] <Cork> burg: with a ajax call in the document ready handler
[04:42:00] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: its called a closure
[04:42:16] <banisterfiend> ohcibi: yeah i know :) i'm just not so familiar with javascript (ruby background :)
[04:42:18] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: like the function you're passing to click() itself
[04:42:34] <banisterfiend> ruby is a closure wonderland
[04:42:40] <chilversc_> burg: is it related to this? http://stackoverflow.com/a/12544667/35233
[04:42:44] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: try coffeescript, you'll like the syntax 8)) but first learn the principles of js 8-)
[04:43:09] <banisterfiend> ohcibi: cool, will do
[04:44:06] <delboy1978uk> any of you guys used nestedSortable?
[04:44:17] <ohcibi> delboy1978uk: ask! 8-)
[04:44:39] <burg> chilversc_, i think so. actually i make that request with ajaxForm plugin, and i also have a input[type=file]
[04:44:52] <chilversc_> burg: ah, if its using an iframe to do the upload it isn't an ajax request
[04:45:09] <ohcibi> delboy1978uk: i played a bit around and made a rails-plugin from it
[04:45:16] <burg> let me check
[04:45:19] <chilversc_> burg: and everything is working correctly (since iframes contain content to display to the user) so when IE can't render the content in the iframe it asks the user to save it
[04:46:34] <chilversc_> burg: if you want actual ajax and don't need to support browsers like ie6 you can use form data instead to upload the file, http://stackoverflow.com/a/8598235/35233
[04:46:43] <burg> chilversc_, if so, the solution is to return plain text and parse it with JSON.parse ?
[04:47:21] <chilversc_> burg: important note is that file in formData.append("image", file) is the actual DOM input file element
[04:48:11] <chilversc_> burg: that will work, but its a hack (much like the iframe thing being a hack)
[04:49:06] <banisterfiend> is there a way to see javascript errors?
[04:49:10] <banisterfiend> rather than having it just not work?
[04:49:20] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: always use developers console
[04:49:24] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: f12 on chrome
[04:49:47] <banisterfiend> ohcibi: and that'll show last errors that occured?
[04:50:00] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: it shows all errors that occur
[04:50:08] <banisterfiend> cool
[04:50:14] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: and has a debugger, and an element inspector, and, and, and, and 8-))
[04:50:27] <banisterfiend> nice
[04:50:34] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: you yould call debugger; in your script or just make a breakpoint in the devtools itself
[04:50:42] <banisterfiend> ohcibi: are you also a ruby programmer?
[04:51:22] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: i do some rails stuff, but i consider myself way more experienced in JS nowadays...
[04:51:38] <banisterfiend> ohcibi: ah so you're a front-end dev?
[04:52:00] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: i'm following fat-client thin server mostly
[04:52:21] <ohcibi> so yes
[04:52:35] <banisterfiend> so your backend is node.js?
[04:52:38] <banisterfiend> or still rails/ruby ?
[04:53:25] <ohcibi> banisterfiend: depends.... right now i'm developing a smart-tv app, which is pure HTML/JS... the backend i'm using is a device that comes from another vendor (programmed in java)
[04:53:49] <banisterfiend> ohcibi: very cool
[04:54:34] <jarco> Does anyone have a clue how to change the language that the validate plugin displays its errors in? I see the files are there but I don't know how to change the language
[04:58:25] <jarco> lol his name
[04:58:40] <jarco> afwas means dirty dishes :)
[05:01:17] <chilversc_> jarco: don't you normally just include the file for the language you want?
[05:02:00] <banisterfiend> i have a weird problem, i have this html: https://gist.github.com/4977204
[05:02:53] <banisterfiend> but the js: $("#slider") only matches the *first* link
[05:03:09] <banisterfiend> the first one with id="slider"
[05:03:11] <banisterfiend> rather than all 3
[05:03:14] <ganeshu> can anyone give example of comet?
[05:03:18] <banisterfiend> i put a 'debugger; line in there to see
[05:03:21] <chilversc_> banisterfiend: ids have to be unique
[05:03:40] <jarco> chilversc, I ll try that thanks
[05:04:31] <banisterfiend> chilversc_: ah, thanks
[05:04:54] <banisterfiend> chilversc_: fixed:)
[05:07:06] <DashCC> Cork: thanks for the problem. Some very frustrating hours later I found the error. The ads have changed and it seems that they overwrite my jquery
[05:14:36] <Cork> DashCC: classic
[05:14:49] <Cork> DashCC: might be time to load them in there own iframe
[05:14:58] <Cork> so that they can't fiddle with your page
[05:16:14] * Successful is away, auto-away after 15 minutes, (log\off pager\on)
[05:16:17] <DashCC> yep
[05:17:05] <Cork> Successful: please kill that notificator
[05:18:26] <Yngvar> iksik: disabling and reenabling the events did the trick for me, but I think the last fiddle behavior is a bug
[05:18:31] <Yngvar> iksik: thank you very much!
[05:20:44] <pallet> Hi there, can you help me please, http://pastebin.com/JFD3PhqT I'm trying to pass the variable statsLink
[05:21:02] <pallet> but I'm doing it wrong and I'm after some inspiration
[05:21:22] <Cork> pallet: don't use event attributes, use event listeners
[05:21:48] <pallet> Cork, how do I pass the var to it though
[05:22:19] <Cork> $('<a href="javascript:void(0);">view ' + data.record.clicks + ' click(s) </a>').click(function() { loadExternalContent(statsLink); });
[05:22:36] <pallet> ah
[05:22:48] <Cork> also i would argu don't use a links for anything other then links
[05:23:02] <pallet> ok
[05:23:16] <Cork> you can do the exact same thing with a <span class="link" tabindex="0"></span>
[05:23:38] <Cork> and .link { text-decoration: underline; color: blue; cursor: pointer; }
[05:23:50] <Cork> and that way you don't have to do the href="javascript:void(0); hack
[05:24:12] <pallet> done it
[05:24:15] <pallet> thanks bro
[05:24:19] <Cork> yw
[05:30:10] <brantje> hi guy's
[05:30:18] <brantje> hows everything here?
[05:30:28] <brantje> $('div[id^="search-"] .msg-'+this.id+':first').length << would this work?
[05:32:36] <Cork> brantje: yes
[05:32:44] <Cork> though div[id^="search-"] is a really REALLY bad idea
[05:33:04] <brantje> why?
[05:33:06] <Cork> if you want to search for multiple elements use a class
[05:33:16] <brantje> well
[05:33:16] <Cork> cause you do it in almost the slowest way possible
[05:33:24] <Cork> that will select all divs
[05:33:29] <brantje> ahh
[05:33:33] <Cork> then in js for each div grab its id
[05:33:41] <Cork> then do a regex match on the string from the id attribute
[05:33:43] <brantje> there are only 8 divs
[05:33:49] <Cork> instead of using the fast hash in the browser
[05:34:02] <Cork> brantje: you should never do that anyway
[05:34:03] <brantje> or does it check all divs on page?
[05:34:08] <Cork> learn to do it the right way
[05:34:11] <Cork> yes
[05:34:29] <brantje> ah in that case there can be over 6000 divs
[05:34:30] <brantje> :c
[05:35:02] <Cork> $('div[id^="search-"]') is the same as $('div').filter(function(elm) { elm.id.match(/^search-/); });
[05:35:07] <Cork> or aprox
[05:35:16] <Cork> * $('div[id^="search-"]') is the same as $('div').filter(function(elm) { return elm.id.match(/^search-/); });
[05:35:26] <brantje> and $('div').filter(function(elm) { return elm.id.match(/^search-/); is faster?
[05:35:43] <Cork> might be, but not sure
[05:35:50] <Cork> anyway, use a class its the correct way
[05:36:19] <Cork> $('div.searches .msg-'+this.id+').first()
[05:36:30] <Cork> * $('div.searches .msg-'+this.id).first()
[05:37:41] <Cork> brantje: to put it with a bit of a pun; when in doubt add a class ;)
[05:38:04] <Cork> but its actually not far from the truth
[05:40:35] <brantje> ahh thanks
[05:40:36] <brantje> :)
[05:43:36] <brantje> Cork
[05:43:42] <brantje> $('#search-'+acname+'-cont .msg-'+this.id+':first') < would be better
[05:44:07] <Cork> if you only want to search in one element's children
[05:44:08] <Cork> sure
[05:44:15] <brantje> yep :)
[05:44:42] <Cork> as long as you do a real id search i'm fine with it
[05:44:58] <brantje> It is :)
[05:45:07] <Cork> ya
[05:57:05] <granden> If I have multiples <select> dropdown menus. Where I want to change to a defined value. Like the option with value="4" how would I do that?
[05:57:30] <Cork> $('select').val('4')
[05:57:43] <granden> Ah, cool thanks.

[06:02:45] <k_89> anyone done cors using jquery ?
[06:02:50] <k_89> how do you handle errors
[06:02:51] <k_89> ?
[06:03:40] <Nachtwind> hi, i am currently using the toastmessage plugin and try to add messages in intervals. for testing i currently try to do this:
[06:03:41] <Nachtwind> 				setInterval(function() {
[06:03:41] <Nachtwind> 					var myToast =  $().toastmessage('showNoticeToast', "You sent coins");	
[06:03:41] <Nachtwind> 				}, 500);	
[06:04:12] <Nachtwind> but i get a message telling me that "the object has no message toastmessage"
[06:04:25] <Nachtwind> calling the var mytoast line outside the interval works
[06:04:32] <Nachtwind> any ideas?
[06:06:41] <Cork> k_89: errors?
[06:06:54] <Cork> k_89: you mean when the server don't allow it?
[06:07:38] <k_89> Cork, no .. i have setup a server to accept ajax request from several domains
[06:09:02] <Cork> ok?
[06:09:39] <k_89> Cork, and the server returns a response with 400 status at times
[06:09:52] <k_89> but $.ajax error-handler doesn't get that response
[06:10:01] <Cork> ah...
[06:10:11] <Cork> cors should have nothing to do with that
[06:10:41] <k_89> k
[06:10:45] <k_89> i'll check the code
[06:10:52] <Cork> some errors are handled by the browser and isn't shown to js
[06:11:01] <k_89> Cork, wtf
[06:11:05] <Cork> don't think 400 is one of those though
[06:11:21] <k_89> hmm
[06:11:32] <Cork> well error is the wrong term
[06:11:46] <Cork> i meant some http status codes arn't passed through
[06:11:46] <k_89> Cork, i am getting back the response fine, but the error is being thrown in jquery
[06:11:58] <Cork> thrown?
[06:12:08] <Cork> uh, whats the exception?
[06:12:22] <k_89> bad request
[06:12:39] <Cork> what code line?
[06:12:45] <Cork> in jquery
[06:13:00] <k_89> ah well, let me switch to unminified version, a minute :P
[06:13:00] <Cork> (you can't use minified version of jquery)
[06:13:05] <Cork> :)
[06:16:00] <k_89> Cork, line 8526
[06:16:04] <k_89> on 1.9.1
[06:17:14] <Cork> your sure thats an exception and not just net logging?
[06:17:56] <Cork> if its really en exception it sounds like a browser bug
[06:17:57] <k_89> Cork, how do i know the difference ? :P
[06:18:14] <k_89> it points to a line in jquery
[06:18:15] <Cork> well is it a log with information of the net call
[06:18:22] <jarco> does anyone have any idea how to do validations like, if radio is selected  then make this field required.
[06:18:35] <jarco> Sorry with this plugin : http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[06:18:43] <Cork> k_89: it might be a line to where the net call was started from
[06:19:17] <k_89> Cork, the request is being completed, and its getting back a response, which is the correct response
[06:19:39] <Cork> k_89: can you reproduce it on a fiddle page?
[06:19:51] <Cork> would help to be able to look at it
[06:20:20] <k_89> Cork, its an ajax thing, would be a bit hard to reproduce this bug
[06:20:37] <k_89> i mean i keep the whole ajax layer separate , so ican mock it if needed
[06:20:56] <k_89> but this bug is occurring in regions that i seldom venture to
[06:21:16] <k_89> i'll post the code and screenshots, for as much info as possible
[06:24:14] <ravenzz> say I have a bunch of elements, would using event delegation reduce the amount of event listeners?
[06:24:57] <rudiX> hello
[06:25:09] <rudiX> how to get the date in this format - 2008-07-17T09:24:17Z
[06:27:26] <Nachtwind> hi.. i got this script http://pastie.org/private/obvdvmdacvv1zjh0aurkq   in my html... the upper 4 toasts work flawlessly.. yet the one in the interval does not.. any idea why?
[06:29:33] <masentinel900> Morning guys!!
[06:30:45] <seutje> happy UGT morning to you too!
[06:35:31] <jarco> With this plugin : http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation Does anyone know how to do something like.  If this radio is selected then make this input required
[06:35:45] <lejocelyn> I'd like to parse a file, on the server, into an array
[06:35:59] <lejocelyn> I though of .load()
[06:35:59] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/R9fM3/
[06:36:26] <lejocelyn> but I'd like it to be a global javascript variable
[06:36:34] <Nachtwind> Does Javascript have sort of access levels (public, global etc?) I currently run this script: http://pastie.org/private/obvdvmdacvv1zjh0aurkq     the upper 4 messages work, the last one does not. did i miss something?
[06:36:37] <pallet> Hi all
[06:36:44] <pallet> can $("#statisticsDiv").load(statsUrl); have a callback ?
[06:37:11] <masentinel900> Someone could suggest me how can I get the main <li> tag of that script please
[06:37:20] <k_89> Cork, the fault was in my code, stuff's working fine :P
[06:37:35] <masentinel900> I need to get the first <li> tag, what say "Actas"
[06:39:13] <mathijspb> masentinel900: first of all your not closing your <li> tag
[06:39:18] <Cork> masentinel900: whats the limitations of the selector?
[06:39:31] <Cork> ugg, ya, and that
[06:39:41] <Cork> don't write tag soup!
[06:40:36] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/R9fM3/1/
[06:40:40] <masentinel900> Ready.
[06:42:19] <mathijspb> masentinel900: that isnt correct, first look at http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp how to create an unorderd list
[06:42:31] <mazzachre> Can I change the "hover" css pseudo class of an element I have selected?
[06:42:46] <Cork> masentinel900: http://jsfiddle.net/R9fM3/2/
[06:43:02] <Cork> THATS valid ul/li nesting
[06:43:29] <mathijspb> :)
[06:43:36] <masentinel900> mathijspb: When I onclick in "china" for example I need to get the value of "Actas"
[06:43:49] <masentinel900> <Cork>: Thanks by ordenate it..
[06:44:16] <Cork> masentinel900: simplest would be to have a class on the li element
[06:44:28] <mazzachre> I have a list that is shown when I click the div it is nested inside. However that div have a pseudo hover css that highlight it. However I want to remove that highlight when the mouse enters the list...
[06:44:37] <Cork> but i guess you could do something like $(this).parents('li').first()
[06:44:47] <Cork> but i guess you could do something like $(this).parents('li').first().children('a')
[06:45:08] <ravenzz> Cork is event delegation good for performance?
[06:45:17] <Cork> ravenzz: yes
[06:45:17] <mazzachre> ravenzz: yes
[06:45:24] <Cork> its even VERY good for performance :)
[06:45:42] <Cork> each time you add an event listener to the dom it becomes slower
[06:46:04] <Cork> so the more you can group that together at one point the better will the even flows in the dom
[06:46:12] <mazzachre> If you ever find yourself adding event handlers in a loop, you should consider delegation
[06:46:35] <ravenzz> ok that is what I thought, the case is that I noticed I have around 1300 event listeners on a page
[06:46:39] <ravenzz> mazzachre that
[06:46:44] <Cork> well as soon as you add events on a selector that matches multiple elements
[06:47:04] <Cork> doesn't have to be in a loop
[06:47:08] <ravenzz> so after a quick refactoring now everything uses event delegation
[06:47:22] <mazzachre> Cork: Ya, but it is the same :) Only jquery do the loop for you
[06:47:23] <Cork> $('*').click(function() { alert('UGG!!!') })
[06:47:33] <Cork> mazzachre: true
[06:47:43] <ravenzz> but the dev tools timeline counts still 1300 event listeners
[06:47:51] <Cork> mazzachre: but its quite easy to miss that it actually adds a bunch of listeners
[06:48:08] <mazzachre> Cork: Possibly... if you don't read what the code does, sure :)
[06:48:29] <lejocelyn> can we call a function like this one : (function ajust(){})() in another function : funtion test(){ajust();}
[06:48:30] <Cork> ravenzz: how are you doing the delegation?
[06:48:30] <lejocelyn> ?
[06:48:54] <Cork> lejocelyn: as long as the function is in an accessable scope
[06:49:08] <lejocelyn> in the same page ?
[06:49:14] <Cork> no, same scope
[06:49:34] <Cork> funciton example() {}; example() <-- same scope
[06:49:35] <lejocelyn> if it is in another <script></script> tag, does it affect it ?
[06:49:51] <Cork> (funciton() { funciton example() {} })();; example() <-- not same scope
[06:49:59] <lejocelyn> alright
[06:50:33] <ravenzz> Cork I have a bunch of countries and regions, so right now countries.on("change", "input", cb)
[06:50:40] <ideea> hi. please, help me!! i have script. that inserts ~8000 links (paginator, simple <a href="/2">2</a>. Im inserting it with .html() functions, but dom freezes for 4-6 seconds. how to do this much fsster? maximum with 1sec delay? :(
[06:50:59] <ravenzz> just to see whether the amount of event listeners decrease or not
[06:51:48] <Cork> ravenzz: thats not delegated
[06:52:03] <Cork> you still add one event listener on each countries element
[06:52:30] <Cork> ravenzz: you want a single common parent for all of them
[06:52:35] <ravenzz> but not to the regions right?
[06:53:20] <Cork> if you want to reduce the number of listeners ya
[06:53:48] <lejocelyn> and is this ok : language_list = (function mkLanguage_list(){blabla;})() ;
[06:53:49] <lejocelyn> ?
[06:53:53] <Sonderblade> how can you replace only the text child of an element? $el.text("blah") replaces all the content
[06:54:18] <ravenzz> well that should reduce the amount of event listeners. I'll do what you are saying later
[06:54:22] <Cork> lejocelyn: no that will get the return value from the executing function
[06:54:29] <lejocelyn> ah
[06:54:40] <granden> I got like, var name = $(this).attr('name'); and if($('input:radio[name='+name+']:checked').length == 0) and my name is question[1] question[2] etc etc.
[06:54:41] <Cork> Sonderblade: you can't really do that
[06:54:45] <granden> would that be any problem there?
[06:54:47] <lejocelyn> just language_list = mkLanguage_lit() then ?
[06:54:56] <ravenzz> Cork right, there is my issue, the amount of event listeners is still 1300
[06:55:01] <Cork> lejocelyn: same
[06:55:13] <Cork> you want language_list = mkLanguage_lit
[06:55:14] <lejocelyn> with a good return ?
[06:55:22] <Cork> no ()
[06:55:31] <Sonderblade> Cork: no? is it not possible in f.e: <div>text to replace<span ....></div>
[06:55:49] <ravenzz> oh wait
[06:55:55] <lejocelyn> ah ok
[06:55:56] <Cork> Sonderblade: well you can serialize everything to html, regex replace the text and then parse it all back to dom
[06:56:02] <Cork> Sonderblade: but basically; no
[06:56:12] <ravenzz> 198 yay
[06:56:15] <Cork> Sonderblade: add an extra span where you want to fiddle with the text and use that
[06:56:41] <Cork> ravenzz: heh thats quite a bit less :D
[06:56:47] <ravenzz> ahah it is
[06:57:03] <Sonderblade> Cork: yeah thats easiest, thanks
[06:58:15] <ideea> hi. please, help me!! i have script. that inserts ~8000 links (paginator, simple <a href="/2">2</a>. Im inserting it with jquery .html() functions, but dom freezes for 4-6 seconds. how to do this much fsster? maximum with 1sec delay?
[06:59:25] <Cork> ideea: do you insert them in a bunch or all over the place?
[07:00:19] <ravenzz> jesus 16120 dom nodes :S
[07:00:27] <Cork> lol
[07:00:30] <ideea> Cork: i tried: getting complete html from server and inserting it with .html. Making array of strings in js and appending it with arr.join('')
[07:00:46] <Cork> ideea: and still slow?
[07:01:59] <ideea> Cork: little bit faster. but not enough
[07:02:19] <Cork> weird, that should speed it up a lot
[07:02:40] <Cork> sounds like the pure amount of links might be the problem
[07:02:54] <Cork> ideea: might be worth looking at something like infinite-scroll
[07:03:04] <ideea> http://cl.ly/image/3r0W410O3w1C
[07:03:20] <ideea> Cork: yes, scroll will be th last option, if there is no way to do this with js
[07:03:23] <ideea> :(
[07:03:30] <ideea> there is jscrollpane
[07:04:01] <Cork> ideea: sounds like the pure amount of dom elements is the cause of your problem
[07:22:20] <bnb_dev> Hi
[07:26:26] <drakythe> So newbie question. If I'm wanting to do some math with JQuery/JS, what does the syntax look like? I can't seem to find a good example (all I need is the basics, Addition, Multiplcation, and Division)
[07:26:47] <drakythe> s/Mutiplcation/Multiplication
[07:26:48] <tw2113> 1+1
[07:26:54] <tw2113> use ints
[07:27:15] <lejocelyn> I'd like to change a very basic csv file into a json file
[07:27:29] <drakythe> tw2113: Does it work the same way with variables? I'm gonna be storing my numbers as variables.
[07:27:39] <lejocelyn> for now, there only one info per line
[07:28:02] <bnb_dev> Hello ALL!
[07:28:04] <tw2113> looks like it from what i just tested in console
[07:28:17] <bnb_dev> can some one let me know how to make the menu like https://www.facebook.com/help/?ref=contextual ?
[07:28:27] <drakythe> tw2113: okay. I guess I'm just making it too hard on myself...
[07:28:36] * drakythe wanders back to jsfiddle
[07:30:39] <dblosevn> hey anything look wrong with this? options.url += (/\?/.test(options.url)) ? '?' : '&';
[07:32:17] <bnb_dev> join #css
[07:32:27] <lejocelyn> is : { "french", "english", "german",} into a language.json valide ?
[07:32:48] <lejocelyn> is it a json valide file ?
[07:32:58] <dblosevn> lejocelyn: you have a trailing comma
[07:33:03] <lejocelyn> ok
[07:33:19] <lejocelyn> alright
[07:33:21] <dblosevn> { "french", "english", "german"}
[07:33:43] <dblosevn> but thats still wrong
[07:33:52] <dblosevn> ["french", "english", "german"]
[07:33:57] <lejocelyn> and {"languages":{"french","english","german"}} ?
[07:34:05] <dblosevn> {} is an object [] is an array
[07:34:14] <lejocelyn> ah true
[07:34:24] <tw2113> http://jsonlint.com/
[07:34:30] <dblosevn> that too
[07:34:31] <lejocelyn> so  {"languages":["french","english","german"]} ?
[07:34:38] <dblosevn> ya thats valid
[07:34:48] <lejocelyn> ok thanks, and thanks for the links
[07:34:51] <dblosevn> i have lint in my editer :-)
[07:35:03] <tw2113> mr fancypants
[07:35:06] <dblosevn> lol
[07:35:28] <dblosevn> tw2113: you see anything wrong with my terenary?
[07:35:38] <oopsie> hi ppl
[07:35:45] <tw2113> i assume nothing in here since you still see people wander in who don't know that firebug/inspector consoles are their BFFs
[07:36:02] <dblosevn> I know right :-)
[07:36:08] <tw2113> nope but i'm not that great with js either
[07:36:22] <dblosevn> its not working :-( but it seems like it should
[07:38:48] <daveace> yo, is there any reason why my ajax call posts twice?
[07:38:57] <daveace> using onclick
[07:39:00] <oopsie> because you call it twice?
[07:39:22] <dblosevn> daveace: most likely your binding the click event twice
[07:39:53] <daveace> oh  possibly,  ill have a gander
[07:40:24] <dblosevn> inside your click listener do e.stopPropagation(); e.preventDefault(); and return false; at the bottom of it
[07:40:38] <dblosevn> see if that stops it if it does quit binding more then once :-)
[07:40:45] <Nachtwind> Does Javascript have sort of access levels (public, global etc?) I currently run this script: http://pastie.org/private/obvdvmdacvv1zjh0aurkq     the upper 4 messages work, the last one does not. did i miss something?
[07:41:09] <dblosevn> ?g javascript scope tutorial @ Nachtwind
[07:41:09] <b-ot> Nachtwind: FranÃ§oise Hardy: Letras de MÃºsicas - RÃ¡dio UOL â†’ http://www.radio.uol.com.br/letras-e-musicas/francoise-hardy/47180
[07:41:26] <dblosevn> damn google is screwed the last few days
[07:41:38] <Nachtwind> that bots answer is... strange
[07:41:53] <dblosevn> http://www.mredkj.com/tutorials/reference_js_intro_ex.html
[07:43:06] <Nachtwind> thanks, will have a look
[07:43:13] <dblosevn> :-)
[07:43:43] <dblosevn> oh and my terenary was backwards is why it wasnt working :-) should have been ? '&' : '?'
[07:43:57] <dblosevn> my regex was right
[07:45:45] <Nachtwind> soo... in case i got that right var creates a "global" varíable
[07:45:53] <Nachtwind> so thos http://pastie.org/private/w4wihi7ntyhpdcdtol54jg   should work?=
[07:46:45] <bnb_dev> I have a nested ul li menu, I want when user click on a link then the current menu slide to left and it's child menu slides and take its, How I do that?

[07:53:17] <juria_roberts> I replaced my button by a loader and then i inserted a new button dynamically.Now the click event does not fire. how do I solve this issue?
[07:54:22] <momomomomo> Good morning all
[07:58:00] <dblosevn> juria_roberts: delegate the click event to a parent that does not get dynamically loaded
[07:58:17] <juria_roberts> dblosevn: i solved it by using live
[07:58:29] <dblosevn> live has been depreciated
[07:58:32] <dblosevn> use on
[07:59:00] <dblosevn> ?.on @ juria_roberts
[07:59:20] <juria_roberts> dblosevn: i use an old version of jquery
[08:00:55] <drakythe> http://jsfiddle.net/drakythe/qrUcd/2/ Okay so I have this calculator printing out 2 values concatenated together. How do I get it to actuall _add_ the values?
[08:04:37] <alex88> hi guys, I've embedded something like this http://jsfiddle.net/cTnSu/ in my own page, it works fine in the jsfiddle but on the page gives "RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded" with lot of "jQuery.Event.stopPropagation" lines..what it could be?
[08:05:00] <tlkr> drakythe, http://jsfiddle.net/qrUcd/3/
[08:05:42] <drakythe> tlkr: thank you :)
[08:06:50] <FinalAngel> blubb
[08:07:20] <kelye> from what I see $(window).load is triggered only after the initial window load
[08:07:55] <kelye> if I add some content with ajax, how do I create a trigger that fires only after all the images in the ajax content are loaded
[08:08:01] <pallet> Hi all, this isn't JSON is it... www.wedoyourtweets.com/songbird/songbird.functions.php
[08:08:32] <kelye> pallet: except the string(579)  part
[08:08:34] <kelye> it is json
[08:09:12] <kelye> I guess the output is with var_dump, that's why you're getting that in front
[08:10:32] <pallet> kelye, yeh it was, I was being a bit of an idiot ;)
[08:14:16] <lejocelyn> how to communicate a variable (array) from a php to javascript ?
[08:14:49] <lejocelyn> I've got a list of languages in a file, on the server, that I'd like to load as an array in javascript
[08:15:15] <lejocelyn> the file is in .json and .csv formats
[08:15:50] <lejocelyn> I want it in a variable, not linked to a jquery object
[08:17:38] <BillCriswell> lejocelyn: You can do echo encode_json($listOfLanguages);
[08:18:25] <lejocelyn> BillCriswell: it's already in json
[08:18:30] <lejocelyn> if need to be
[08:18:56] <kelye> then just read the file and echo it inside <script> tags
[08:19:20] <kelye> <script > var languages = <?php echo $list; ?>; </script>
[08:20:24] <lejocelyn> kelye: ok
[08:20:53] <alex88> hi guys, I've embedded something like this http://jsfiddle.net/cTnSu/ in my own page, it works fine in the jsfiddle but on the page gives "RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded" with lot of "jQuery.Event.stopPropagation" lines..what it could be? I'm using in conjunction with the blue imp file upload plugin
[08:22:05] <BillCriswell> lejocelyn: What kelye said will work, or $.getJSON('/languages/all', function(data){ // data should be a list or languages.. }); and assuming /languages/all returns json encoded version of the php array you should be good to work with it
[08:26:08] <lejocelyn> BillCriswell: just var languages = $.getJSON('./iso-639-3/language_list.json');  //should work, assuming language_list.json is an array
[08:26:15] <lejocelyn> no ?
[08:27:01] <kelye> no
[08:27:16] <BillCriswell> lejocelyn: Doesn't work like that, you'd need to do $.getJSON('./iso-639-3/language_list.json', function(data){ var languages = data; // Do things with languages });
[08:27:23] <zoned> are jQueryUI themes responsive?
[08:27:47] <alex88> ok, trying to use blue imp upload plugin with just the drop zone set I get these errors http://pastie.org/6214354 and chrome crashes
[08:27:50] <alex88> any idea?
[08:28:58] <kelye> or if you need the languages outside you can declare var languages ; $.get('...', function(data) { languages = data}
[08:29:19] <lejocelyn> that should do the thin
[08:29:21] <lejocelyn> thing
[08:29:32] <lejocelyn> thanks
[08:36:36] <momomomomo> I'm having a weird issue with some JQ event handlers. Everything works as expected - until I remove an element from the DOM. Once that happens, any new objects added <<within only the very first set of objects affected by the event handler>> stop being affected by the event handler. That's a weird description, so I added a couple of images here to visually show you: http://imgur.com/a/q1d49#0 and here's a gist with the code:
[08:36:36] <momomomomo> https://gist.github.com/momer/4978475
[08:36:55] <momomomomo> would appreciate any help or insight on this!
[08:41:52] <momomomomo> Is anyone around?
[08:46:13] <kelye> yes but the description of your problem is at least ambiguous
[08:46:18] <lejocelyn> I do autocompleting of an input tag with Jquery UI. That input gets clone if the user needs more of it. I can't get the autocompletion to work on the new input created with .clone()
[08:46:30] <lejocelyn> is there any specific reason it could not work ?
[08:46:37] <kelye> .clone(true)
[08:47:19] <lejocelyn> :D
[08:47:19] <lejocelyn> ok
[08:48:20] <momomomomo> kelye: sorry about that - the pictures really show more of what's going on. I have an event handler attached to the 'remove_fields' link
[08:48:43] <kelye> ok, got that
[08:49:44] <momomomomo> kelye: I also have an event handler attached to the 'select' elements, which start up as hidden, with the classes .add-deliverable-fields
[08:49:49] <momomomomo> sorry - i just noticed some are missing from the gist
[08:50:51] <lejocelyn> kelye: well, it's not that :(
[08:51:19] <momomomomo> updated that kelye! So, essentially, when a 'Deliverable Type' select option is changed, it fires off JQ to check if there are corresponding options that should be shown in a hidden select element. If so, it makes them appear. Otherwise, it stays hidden.
[08:52:14] <kelye> lejocelyn: pls give more details
[08:52:23] <maxmoore14> I found several blog posts, etc that talk about using jqueryui autocomplete with jquery mobile - but all are a very old - wondering if anyone has a current recommendation
[08:52:25] <kelye> you want to add fields that have autocomplete ?
[08:52:47] <lejocelyn> yes
[08:52:59] <lejocelyn> I'm copying the work on jsfiddle
[08:53:05] <kelye> good
[08:53:56] <kelye> ok, momomomomo .. and the issue is ?
[08:53:58] <gotwig> HELP!
[08:54:22] <kelye> that's an issue !
[08:54:35] <gotwig> it is?
[08:54:43] <lejocelyn> kelye: http://jsfiddle.net/hGAhV/ but it doesn't work on jsfiddle.net
[08:55:10] <gotwig> well, I've got $('*[data-content-id='+id+']').attr('src') , now how can I check the first few charachters of that thing, and return true if it matches and false if it doesnt matches? (e.g https://blub.de)
[08:55:13] <momomomomo> kelye: after removing a grouping of elements by pressing 'remove', the event handler fails to apply to new elements in the first <<row>> of elements
[08:55:22] <gotwig> do I need regex for that..?
[08:55:49] <momomomomo> kelye: http://imgur.com/a/q1d49#2 shows what I mean
[08:56:18] <kelye> gotwig: it seems like you do need regexp
[08:56:26] <gotwig> so what
[08:56:59] <gotwig> .match
[08:56:59] <gotwig> ah
[08:57:24] <gotwig> UrlREgex
[08:57:59] <gotwig> .match(new RegExp(pattern))
[08:58:01] <gotwig> nice
[08:58:18] <tirengarfio_> hi, is it better to insert a line that loads jquery from google, or store it in my web project?
[08:58:40] <tirengarfio_> *download/store it in my project?
[08:59:05] <tirengarfio_> i read some time ago something about what was better but i can not fount it now..
[08:59:38] <momomomomo> tirengarfio_: it depends on your situation - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2180391/why-should-i-use-googles-cdn-for-jquery
[08:59:51] <gotwig> var matches = aString.match(new RegExp(pattern));
[08:59:51] <gotwig>  is that good?
[09:00:20] <eddiemonge> https://twitter.com/eddiemonge/status/298887215457640448
[09:00:20] <b-ot> eddiemonge: @eddiemonge: Another benefit to loading #jQuery or other library from a CDN: You help make other sites faster as well. Not always all about your site
[09:01:36] <kelye> lejocelyn: in your on('clik' event add at the end
[09:01:57] <kelye> $('#'+newAttr).autocomplete ...
[09:02:01] <momomomomo> gotwig: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#Using_Parenthesized_Substring_Matches
[09:02:17] <kelye> or even better, move the autocomplete init in a separate function
[09:02:26] <kelye> and call it from on(click) and also on page load
[09:03:08] <momomomomo> kelye: did those images help provide context? It's a tough to describe situation through words
[09:03:28] <lejocelyn> the autocomplete init ?
[09:03:39] <lejocelyn> you mean like this :
[09:04:34] <delboy1978uk> how do i expand a collapsed div when i drag something over it? http://jsfiddle.net/delboy1978uk/nKRsf/
[09:04:39] <lejocelyn> function autocomplete(object){object.autocomplete({blabla});}
[09:04:40] <lejocelyn> ?
[09:04:50] <delboy1978uk> ie. if you drag over a closed folder, i want the folder to open so you can continue dragging into position
[09:05:20] <kelye> lejocelyn: http://jsfiddle.net/hGAhV/1/
[09:06:37] <lejocelyn> kelye: with two arguments, one for the selector, one for the source, it should work
[09:06:40] <lejocelyn> thanks
[09:14:44] <momomomomo> kelyeAW: resolved my issue, thank you for offering to take a look at it!
[09:16:41] <relipse>  i need a slide to unlock feature for phonegap , how do I do this? Can i use jquery mobile?
[09:20:09] <maxmoore14> anyone have a suggestion for autocomplete with jquery mobile?
[09:20:39] <maxmoore14> considering writing my own widget, but that seems like a lot of work if there is something that already exists
[09:20:51] <maxmoore14> just haven't been able to find anything yet
[09:21:37] <momomomomo> maxmoore14: http://andymatthews.net/code/autocomplete/
[09:22:00] <maxmoore14> momomomomo: yeah, I saw that one - have you used it?
[09:22:18] <momomomomo> no, but I can quick whip up a jsfiddle if needed, whats the issue
[09:23:06] <maxmoore14> momomomomo: I just know nothing about it or the guy who wrote it. no idea how stable/tested/cross platform it is
[09:23:28] <momomomomo> maxmoore14: https://github.com/commadelimited/autoComplete.js
[09:23:37] <gotwig> momomomomo, got it
[09:24:07] <maxmoore14> momomomomo: that's the same one
[09:24:16] <momomomomo> gotwig: nice!
[09:25:18] <momomomomo> maxmoore14: if you want to read more info about itâ€¦ look at the github page
[09:26:06] <maxmoore14> momomomomo: no kidding
[09:27:38] <momomomomo> maxmoore14: have you tried http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/widgets/autocomplete/
[09:29:01] <micz123> hi is it possible to use angularjs script and jquery script in one web page?

[09:32:20] <momomomomo> sure, paste it in a gist
[09:50:42] <gusti> trying to make jwplayer to work in a loop but not display anything http://pastebin.com/NdMykDbi
[09:59:26] <gusti> hello
[10:03:07] <roswell> hi gusti
[10:07:03] <DukeDrake> hi
[10:09:43] <gusti> how are you
[10:10:34] <roswell> same fine tyty
[10:10:44] <drakythe> If I'm wanting to add multiple variables together, how would I go about that in a single line? var new = var1 + var2 + var3; isn't return what is expected. Though var1 + var2, or var1+ var3; etc works as expected.
[10:12:51] <roswell> drakythe, possibly it's because you're concatenating a number to a string
[10:13:49] <drakythe> roswell: I think I am... I'm such a newb I'm just hacking my way through this with whatever I can find on google. Here is what I have so far http://jsfiddle.net/qrUcd/6/
[10:14:11] <drakythe> actually _learning_ JS/jQuery is on my list of "really need to do that" right behind "find more time!"
[10:15:04] <drakythe> roswell: if you remove any of the added vars on line 9 it behaves as expected, but with all 3 I get weird results...
[10:18:54] <gotwig> momomomomo, I mean like the end result
[10:19:13] <momomomomo> sure, watch got gotwig?
[10:19:28] <gotwig> momomomomo, www.bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php
[10:19:57] <gotwig> you have to refresh the page after an upload
[10:20:02] <roswell> drakythe, i guess you're not outputting the total value on line 12
[10:20:49] <drakythe> roswell: I'm using the debug on line 11 for the moment. I've been doing a couple different calculations on each run, so I have to output fields
[10:21:10] <drakythe> s/two/to
[10:21:17] <roswell> drakythe, which values you were applying?
[10:22:57] <drakythe> roswell: line 9. var total = hrwage + hrworkmanscomp + hrliability; -- won't work with all 3 vars, use any 2 vars though and it comes out as expected
[10:23:27] <roswell> drakythe, check lines 11 and 12, i guess you're messed up a bit with the code )
[10:23:33] <gotwig> momomomomo, nice, hm?
[10:23:42] <momomomomo> gotwig: will check out in a few minutes here browser being funky
[10:23:44] <gotwig> I still got some problems with live event handlers
[10:24:06] <momomomomo> i had some earlier, whats your issue?
[10:25:21] <gotwig> momomomomo, with the implementation of match ;P
[10:25:26] <drakythe> roswell: I know line 12 isn't printing out my total var, it isn't supposed to be right now. Thats line 11's job, which stupidly because this is hacked together, is printed out _after_ line 12 in the html.
[10:25:35] <momomomomo> gotwig: on an event handler? paste your code in a gist
[10:25:40] <gotwig> momomomomo, when I just add something to the DOM... it doesnt work with that one
[10:25:50] <momomomomo> gotwig: paste your code to gist.github.com
[10:26:32] <roswell> drakythe, uhm... describe what are you trying to achieve, that's going to be faster )
[10:28:49] <gusti> jw player wont run in a wordpress loop ?
[10:29:49] <DukeDrake> hmmmmm, why does $('#myform').submit(myfunction); work, but $('#myform').submit(myfunction()); not?
[10:31:12] <FernandoBasso> I know that we can check that the user pushed <Enter> with if ( event.which == 13 ). How to trigger a function if the user has clicked the submit button _or_ hit <Enter>?
[10:32:35] <DukeDrake> FernandoBasso: lol, that would be .submit()
[10:32:47] <momomomomo> I've got nothing showing up on your page gotwig.
[10:32:59] <gotwig> momomomomo, like, really ;D?
[10:33:12] <gotwig> lool
[10:33:13] <gotwig> :(
[10:33:16] <gotwig> momomomomo, you're right
[10:33:27] <momomomomo> aye - ran it in a sandboxed browser - looked like a sketchy url :)
[10:33:50] <roswell> FernandoBasso, bind the same function to both event handlers
[10:34:03] * gotwig is a fucking bastard... did not do backups
[10:34:32] <DukeDrake> roswell: how about .... submit() handler?
[10:34:41] <gotwig> ... yeah I've got a window open actually with the code
[10:34:50] <momomomomo> gotwig: get started with git: http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/
[10:34:52] <gotwig> now really, what is that for an online IDE; that actually Overwrittes your file with NOTHING???
[10:35:03] <gotwig> wtf, I am really fucked up
[10:35:14] <FernandoBasso> roswell: But I have a variable that detects if it was the first submit attempt, and if so, I insert a message in the page, and only then the user can really submit the form.
[10:35:27] <gotwig> momomomomo, I know git, its a lot of work
[10:35:40] <gotwig> momomomomo, I still see my applications not as *real* applications...
[10:35:53] <brantje> gotwig
[10:35:58] <brantje> Rule 1 in IT
[10:36:02] <brantje> Always make backups
[10:36:03] <drakythe> roswell: I'd like var total to be the sum of the 3 variables, and to print out in the debug line 11. When I attempt to add them together, I get a non-expected result.
[10:36:26] <roswell> FernandoBasso, then maybe (as above) you want to update submit() handler?
[10:36:34] <drakythe> roswell: for example I'm using the numbers 10, 8, and 13. That should add out to a total of 12.1 once all the calculations and additions have been done.
[10:36:43] * gotwig is a lucky bastard...
[10:37:07] <roswell> this time )
[10:37:29] <momomomomo> gotwig: git is not a lot of work at all
[10:37:40] <gusti> hi
[10:37:48] <momomomomo> git add . git commit -am "poop" rinse, repeat - start using branches if you want to do it right
[10:37:50] <gotwig> momomomomo, I dont have a hard working environment
[10:37:58] <gotwig> I have to switch my locations for work, all the  time
[10:38:07] <momomomomo> so?
[10:38:09] <gotwig> on all sort of PC's, I work at around 30 pc's every month
[10:38:18] <momomomomo> and?
[10:38:27] <gotwig> so, how can I use git normally with that....
[10:38:35] <gotwig> momomomomo, can I use git with FTP?
[10:38:39] <gotwig> I think so
[10:38:46] <momomomomo> git pull "https://github.com/username/your_project.git"
[10:38:50] <momomomomo> and you have your project wherever you need it
[10:38:57] <momomomomo> any computer
[10:39:03] <gotwig> I still wonder what happened to my project
[10:39:09] <FernandoBasso> roswell, DukeDrake https://gist.github.com/FernandoBasso/4233108 When I submit the form for the first time, it is not being prevented for submitting..
[10:39:41] <FernandoBasso> Oh, then I have to attach the handler to the form, and I am currently doing it to the input button. Duh!
[10:40:08] <roswell> yet don't forget about event.preventDefault(); // just in case
[10:40:20] <gotwig> momomomomo, now really... overwritting the file with no content is not good, right?
[10:40:26] <FernandoBasso> Okay. Thanks.
[10:41:10] <gotwig> momomomomo, then I have to differencate between published site and working site
[10:41:23] <momomomomo> gotwig: create a branch
[10:41:28] <momomomomo> push the branch to your repository
[10:41:38] <momomomomo> read that link i sent you earlier
[10:41:41] <gotwig> momomomomo, I know git, believe me
[10:41:45] <gotwig> but I don't see the use here...
[10:42:04] <gotwig> I know github... I know launchpad, I know bzr...
[10:43:49] <FernandoBasso> DukeDrake: It seems that .submit() is submitting the form for me then.
[10:47:55] <goddard> is there a way i can set an input field as valid or invalid
[10:47:57] <gotwig> momomomomo, still thx for your help ;D
[10:48:05] <gotwig> goddard, lol?
[10:48:26] <goddard> gotwig, have you heard of html5 and its valid or invalid styling
[10:48:32] <gotwig> no :(
[10:48:44] <FernandoBasso> It worked using .on('submit', handler);
[10:49:40] <drakythe> roswell: oh lordy. I just figured out whats going on (partially) and I'm a dork. It _is_ giving me the expected result, with just a few added 0's and a 1, so I trim those off and I'm golden. *sigh*
[10:52:17] <k_89> any idea how to do this in 1.9.x http://jsfiddle.net/mBnAz/1/
[10:52:19] <k_89> it fails
[10:54:13] <roswell> <script><form> <-- wtf?
[10:54:31] <ajpiano> k_89: you have to use $.parseHTML
[10:54:35] <ajpiano> `docs parseHTML
[10:54:46] <ajpiano> roswell: it's a template
[10:54:47] <k_89> ajpiano, cool, thanks :)
[10:54:59] <roswell> gosh
[10:55:16] <k_89> i find it easier to write apps using mainly Backbone.Events, underscore and jquery
[10:55:22] <k_89> and of course, require
[10:55:27] <ajpiano> k_89: http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#jquery-htmlstring-versus-jquery-selectorstring
[10:55:47] <k_89> i seldom use Backbone.Views
[10:55:48] <ajpiano> k_89: if you're using require you should use the text plugin or something
[10:55:58] <k_89> ajpiano, ?
[10:56:02] <ajpiano> instead of <script> templates
[10:56:08] <k_89> oh, yeah
[10:56:17] <k_89> probably will switch to that
[10:56:20] <k_89> thanks
[10:56:30] <ajpiano> https://github.com/requirejs/text or what's really awesome is https://github.com/SlexAxton/require-handlebars-plugin
[10:56:40] <ajpiano> then you actually get a compiled template back
[10:57:43] <jrockjiggz> roswell, ajpiano: alternative to parseHTML() i found using filter can work (globalEval) -- thoughts? http://jsfiddle.net/mBnAz/3/
[10:58:23] <k_89> ajpiano, nice, i remember having looked at it earlier ... it was in the back of my mind to put that in sometime, probably will do it now only :)
[10:58:31] <ajpiano> :)
[11:08:47] <maxmoore14> using the jqm listview with a remote filter... how can I manipulate the search input?
[11:09:28] <maxmoore14> I want to load buttons into the listview, handle the click event, and set the search input val to the selected item
[11:13:11] <gotwig> momomomomo, hey
[11:13:14] <gotwig> momomomomo, wanna try out ;P?
[11:13:19] <momomomomo> sure gotwig
[11:13:27] <gotwig> momomomomo, you got the URL?
[11:13:32] <momomomomo> nope
[11:14:17] <gotwig> wait, I fix a thing ;P
[11:19:34] <foo> I am using Easy Nivo Slider and it shows the loading icon for 1-2 seconds even if images are all in cache. I am trying to speed this up/optimize site, but it seems like it shows the loading icon no matter what. Any tips on why this happens?
[11:20:58] <gotwig> momomomomo, ready: http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php
[11:21:05] <mikehaas763> I only have access to the latest jquery and I cannot use plugins etc. If I simple want to show an error if the ajax login was incorrect what pattern would be people using jquery typically use? Simply set visibility of the element to hidden/visible as appropriate?
[11:23:23] <gotwig> momomomomo, when you remove a box, it actually removed all references now...
[11:24:01] <momomomomo> so what are you trying to do with this?
[11:24:14] <momomomomo> (that isn't working)
[11:26:22] <gotwig> momomomomo, what isnt working?
[11:26:30] <momomomomo> i don't know, you tell me
[11:28:31] <gotwig> momomomomo, I am currently doing changes... basicly you select an image file, and it gets saved in the box
[11:28:47] <momomomomo> nice, it looks really neat
[11:30:07] <gotwig> momomomomo, its a school project. A+ incoming :D
[11:30:27] <momomomomo> good work, keep at it
[11:30:34] <gotwig> momomomomo, actually the time gets updated, when you change stuff, inline text editing
[11:30:50] <gotwig> currently the timestamp just works with the title xD
[11:30:52] <gotwig> :(
[11:31:04] <gotwig> and you cant move text good, and images, you have to drag with the corner
[11:31:07] <momomomomo> store it in a variable?
[11:31:16] <fission6> i have this snippet which works just fine, http://dpaste.org/3SKcO/, the issue is that i am loading in some dom stuff via ajax, how can i have this snippet "live"
[11:31:22] <gotwig> momomomomo, no, that is 100% sql ;P
[11:31:36] <gotwig> momomomomo, I try to seperate as much as possible.. mysql is awesome for sure.
[11:31:38] <foo> http://166.78.58.123/ - can anyone help me figure out why the loading icon continues to show up with the rotating slider? eg. even if the images are cached, it still shows up
[11:31:44] <gotwig> altough we only learn oracle sql at school
[11:32:18] <momomomomo> right on, I've been using postgres as my go-to
[11:32:34] <momomomomo> fission6: so what's the issue?
[11:33:13] <fission6> i load some dom content via ajax which brings in neew content that the selectors in that snippet should select
[11:33:22] <fission6> its the whole "live" selector thing
[11:33:33] <momomomomo> ok
[11:33:52] <momomomomo> is this run by any event handler, or just the document load
[11:34:30] <momomomomo> and, is the new content loaded in by a certain event handler fission6 ? paste that code as well
[11:35:52] <fission6> ok in due time, one sec
[11:45:13] <Sabrina-> hi :D
[11:46:18] <lz> Sarina- howdy :)
[11:48:12] <Sabrina-> :) whats the best way to multiply a section of a form depending of what a user choose. I have already use the button and clone method but i m not rely pleased with the result..
[11:49:00] <Sabrina-> -newby alert- :$
[11:50:54] <garciawebdev> hey, i need to be able to "undo" changes in DOM
[11:50:59] <tyebud> Hey jquery!  I'm trying to use the sortable library to create a stacking effect.  Is there a way to make the list anchor to the bottom, instead of the top of the div?  Here's the example I've put together - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/iHboE
[11:51:28] <garciawebdev> i'm currently cloning deep with data and events the element i need to backup
[11:51:56] <masentinel900> Hello guys!!
[11:52:12] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/kMKXq/
[11:52:16] <lz> Sabrina-, could you set up an example on jsfiddle?
[11:52:37] <Sabrina-> can i wrote it here?
[11:52:41] <garciawebdev> and then "undoing" replacing the element with the cloned copy
[11:52:47] <garciawebdev> but it misses the data
[11:53:56] <masentinel900> I have a trouble, someone have a Idea if can I conditioned the function for change the value of a var depending if a tag has or  not has id property
[11:55:31] <lz> Sabrina-, jsfiddle is preferred :)
[11:58:16] <garciawebdev> any help?
[11:58:27] <Sabrina-> I have a div with id adult witch have a name and a job input. i use a button if there is another adult and if he press it will repeat the div section. can i do something like to ask the user how many adults are they and with the number who will give me to repeat the div section?
[11:58:42] <Sabrina-> lz i must go i ll let it open to see your answer
[12:03:26] <garciawebdev> does .replaceWith() puts also data?
[12:05:48] <Stampy> Is there complete documentation somewhere for the jqXHR object?  I just want to see what functions it has, but the docs on jquery.com about this object are circular and don't actually describe the object - they just describe other functions that use the object
[12:06:35] <Stampy> also, I've been seeing conflicting reports that $.getJSON().error() won't be triggered on CORS calls, is this correct?
[12:07:33] <shoky> Stampy: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[12:19:48] <Stampy> shoky, that's exactly the doc I was looking at, but it's missing a ton of information about that object.
[12:20:52] <jeffsmykil> How do you call a function in a plugin once this is no longer in scope?
[12:21:33] <HardFu> hi, is there a jQuery plugin that detects emails (or certain words) inside a textarea and triggers an event if it does?
[12:21:40] <Stampy> for example, that document doesn't even describe jqXHR.status, which is kind of an important one
[12:21:48] <garciawebdev> any ideas why this evaluates to false??: http://pastebin.com/xLG3Danw
[12:22:15] <shoky> Stampy: sure it does
[12:22:35] <shoky> Stampy: For backward compatibility with XMLHttpRequest, a jqXHR object will expose the following properties and methods:  ... status ...
[12:22:56] <garciawebdev> i'm cloning and then doing replaceWith with the same cloned element, should be the same
[12:23:27] <garciawebdev> (cloning deep with data and events)
[12:23:39] <shoky> garciawebdev:  cloning doesnt mean it'll be equal in javascript..
[12:23:41] <Stampy> oh, it's down below that weird deprecation notice, got it
[12:23:50] <garciawebdev> shoky, i see
[12:24:13] <garciawebdev> shoky is that the correct way to do that then?
[12:24:48] <shoky> depends what you want done..
[12:24:51] <garciawebdev> i mean, i use this.$el a lot and i need to restore it from the cloned copy, in the DOM and in the data
[12:25:11] <garciawebdev> (i mean, that element has data)
[12:27:02] <garciawebdev> shoky, any idea?
[12:27:23] <garciawebdev> (this.$el is already in the DOM)
[12:28:45] <trollboy> anyone recommend a good ajax driven tree plugin? if I click on a folder, I'd prefer something to do a ajax call to get subcontents..
[12:29:48] <jeffsmykil> troll boy any time i have needed it i have just written my own
[12:30:39] <trollboy> and I've written my own as well, but we're already over time estimates & this is feature creap... so if an acceptable plugin exists, sure.. elsewise.. we scrap the feature
[12:30:44] <shoky> garciawebdev: its fine doing that.. but i think you have to update your this.$el field to point to the newly inserted clone
[12:31:07] <Adavia> anyone uses twitter bootstrap here?
[12:31:19] <jeffsmykil> Adavia: yes I have
[12:31:24] <garciawebdev> shoky, please, take a look at this: http://pastebin.com/NFB6BBas
[12:31:56] <Adavia> jeffsmykil:  what im missing in the dropdown tab http://jsfiddle.net/DHZNv/389/
[12:32:16] <shoky> garciawebdev:  see what i just said.
[12:32:22] <shoky> garciawebdev: exactly my point
[12:32:28] <garciawebdev> shoky, you mean i have to this.$el = this.$graphBeforeEditing after the replace?
[12:32:59] <shoky> garciawebdev:  i think so.. not 100% sure tho without an actual fiddle
[12:33:16] <shoky> garciawebdev:  see http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/vSMRq/1/
[12:34:46] <jeffsmykil> Adavia: not sure off hand I woulld have to stare at the bootstrap documentation page
[12:35:11] <Adavia> jeffsmykil:  okok
[12:41:22] <garciawebdev> shoky, thanks. i'm worried because this should be modular, i mean, i don't know the initialization selector from here to select again this.$el
[12:41:50] <omnipotent1> anybody use bxslider?
[12:42:54] <jacta> is there a mobile specific channel too?
[12:43:47] <shoky> garciawebdev:  yea then do what you said, this.$el = this.$graphBeforeEditing
[12:45:12] <garciawebdev> shoky, app starts working weird...
[12:45:53] <shoky> shrugs
[12:45:53] <b-ot> shoky: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[12:46:11] <jamiejackson> hi folks. i've got this code to expand and collapse fieldsets (http://jsfiddle.net/9LZKM/2/). right now, it does everything i want, except...
[12:46:36] <jamiejackson> 1. i want it to expand the fieldset if it contains a checked checkbox
[12:47:14] <jamiejackson> 2. it uses (what looks like) a deprecated function: toggle(handler, handler)
[12:47:56] <jamiejackson> 3. it doesn't seem to be factored very well, and i'd like to know how/whether to factor it better
[12:48:26] <jamiejackson> if anybody can help with one or more of those issues, i'd appreciate it.
[12:50:59] <jamiejackson> wrt #2, i mean i'd like it to expand the fieldset if it contains a checked checkbox *onload*, otherwise it should still be expandable/collapsible
[12:55:16] <balr0g> hello, this is working for me now, but i need it smooth and animated, can you help me please? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5013281/need-javascript-to-auto-scroll-to-the-target-html-element-after-page-loads
[13:14:06] <jacta> Can anyone help me with my project? Is it possible "get rid" of "page flickers" when browsing around? http://9l.dk/newshop/ - im prety new, maybe im all wrong
[13:14:55] <lz> jacta, I don't see any flickers
[13:15:45] <jacta> when changing "list" it glimps alot
[13:15:52] <jacta> think its not the right way im doing it?
[13:16:22] <lz> jacta, everything works fine for me :/
[13:16:31] <lz> chrome  24.0.1312.57
[13:16:54] <RA3OR> data-inline="true"class="ui-btn-right">Options
[13:16:57] <RA3OR> missed a space there
[13:16:58] <jacta> cant you see the header blinks when changing?
[13:17:11] <RA3OR> jacta
[13:17:13] <shoky> jamiejackson: here's a start.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/9LZKM/4/
[13:17:24] <jacta> let me try RA3OR
[13:18:36] <jacta> RA3OR - changed ;) do you know why it blinks
[13:20:03] <RA3OR> jacta: where are you processing the list links?
[13:20:15] <jerware> moin.
[13:20:20] <RA3OR> moin
[13:20:22] <jerware> anyone have any links for the best way (thinking colgroups here), to highlight table columns upon mouse over for dynamically sized grids?
[13:20:28] <jerware> dynamic being, number of rows can change.
[13:21:11] <jacta> RA3OR - its all loaded on page load - or what do you mean?
[13:21:17] <RA3OR> jerware: css selector :hover dont work ?
[13:21:29] <jacta> maybe I should make it another way instead - not sure
[13:21:58] <jerware> RA3OR: I want to highlight the whole column of td's not just one td.  and td's are groups by tr
[13:22:45] <RA3OR> jerware class="someclassName colNumber??"
[13:22:54] <RA3OR> and use hover for that colNumber?? class
[13:23:20] <jacta> RA3OR, maybe I have to many headers or such hmm - really need expert help
[13:24:40] <danheberden> jerware: it might be worth creating a style element and creating your own css rule programatically
[13:25:57] <danheberden> e.g., hover over the 3rd td, so create a rule "#table td:nth-child(" + indexOfTdInRow + ") { /* blah blah blah */ }
[13:26:02] <danheberden> or whatever
[13:26:58] <jacta> Can anyone help me too?
[13:27:09] <danheberden> if you *do* add numeric classes to each td - e.g., .column1, .column2 etc
[13:27:39] <danheberden> well, namely, if you have a limited amount of columns
[13:29:04] <keirlav87> can anyone point me to a good example of using jquery deferred object to chain ajax calls?
[13:29:39] <jacta> RA3OR, did you leave me :S
[13:38:14] <jacta> so quired in here :o

[13:50:59] <jeffsmykil> i know thats why i said it
[13:52:30] <jeffsmykil> a slow lumbering running back might also be available
[13:52:39] <ajpiano> madabyss: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[13:52:43] <jeffsmykil> or maybe you could pick up bradshaw and continue with the giants sloppy seconds trend
[13:53:06] <ajpiano> guh
[13:54:00] <relipse>  is there a way to get http://labs.engageinteractive.co.uk/itoggle/ <-- to work ONLY when you drag the mouse over (instead of a tap or click)
[13:54:02] <jeffsmykil> nets or knicks ajpiano?
[13:54:18] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: historically knicks, but now i like the nets too
[13:54:59] <madabyss> ajpiano: Thanks dude.
[13:55:09] <jeffsmykil> a whiny point guard will bring out the fan base for any team

[13:56:09] <jeffsmykil> good seats?
[13:56:17] <jeffsmykil> I also hear its very expensive
[13:56:23] <ajpiano> yeah, went luxury box the second time
[13:56:30] <jeffsmykil> yikes

[13:56:35] <jeffsmykil> big pimpin
[13:56:53] <jeffsmykil> Here I thought Beasely was a hot ticket
[13:57:15] <relipse> is it possible to make http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/forms/switch/ NOT WORK onclick (my button needs to ONLY work when touch dragging)
[13:57:23] <drag0nius> is it possible to retrieve stylesheet values?
[13:57:41] <drag0nius> of those included in <link>'s
[14:05:32] <jamiejackson> shoky, thank you! you solution has all kinds of pieces i wouldn't have thought of.
[14:06:15] <madabyss> ajpiano: Okay, that wasn't quite what I needed. I have several different sentences containing shapes. I need to parse the string for a match from an array.
[14:06:24] <Drager> I'm trying to do a slider; http://jsfiddle.net/VFYaS/ but when I click on "Next" I want the first one to be hidden (slide away) and the other one to be shown.
[14:06:25] <madabyss> Does that make sense?
[14:07:57] <scriptraptor> Hi guys is there a good way to retrieve only the GET variables of a $foo[0].form.action string? foo.php?a=1&b=2 --> i want ?a=1&b=2, is it regex only or is there a better way in jq?
[14:08:42] <ajpiano> madabyss: sort of ?
[14:09:18] <ajpiano> madabyss: just iterate over the array and find if string.indexOf(arrayItem) > -1
[14:09:23] <Foxhoundz> Hello jQ
[14:13:05] <xboi209> what's the difference between $("div1 > div2") and $("div1 div2")?
[14:14:13] <omnipotent1> > selects a direct child
[14:19:03] <keirlav87> if i have an object with say 5 properties, and one of those properties is another object, say with 10 properties, whats the best method of getting all of obj[n].propObj[1] into an array, for the length of the object? I hope that makes sense!
[14:19:33] <awc737> what does this error mean? Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for '9882' in
[14:19:55] <ajpiano> it means that you can't use the 'in' operator to search in a string
[14:20:45] <awc737> I'm not trying to use in, but I'm using .each

[14:20:48] <awc737> thanks
[14:20:51] <ajpiano> ah
[14:25:49] <Mage_Dude> I'm trying to attach the .validate() plugin to a form and it's not working. Anyone mind if I rubber duck why it's not working here?
[14:26:59] <coldhead> the rubber duck will want more than "it's not working"
[14:27:23] <coldhead> because as the rubber duck likes to silently say "it works fine in my imagination"
[14:27:32] <coldhead> goddamn smartass duck
[14:27:37] <Mage_Dude> Correct, I gotta start talking, but wanted to make sure I didn't get an "STFU" :)
[14:27:43] <Mikeumus> quickie, can find() find ID's? like so: $contents = $body.find("#contents")
[14:27:58] <coldhead> it can find any selector, Mikeumus
[14:28:02] <coldhead> IDs included
[14:28:04] <Mikeumus> I'm getting undefined,   8(
[14:28:05] <Mikeumus> ok
[14:28:16] <Mikeumus> must be something else then
[14:28:17] <coldhead> you're not using duplicate IDs are you?
[14:28:25] <coldhead> you shouldn't need to .find() an ID
[14:28:26] <Mikeumus> I'll double check
[14:28:31] <coldhead> $('#content') should suffice
[14:28:38] <Mage_Dude> Mikeumus: Any reason you can't just $("#contents).stuff()?
[14:29:01] <relipse> does jquerymobile have touch down support?
[14:29:01] <Mikeumus> that breaks my code for some reason too. It's cheero's embedded jquery
[14:29:29] <ajpiano> Mikeumus: cheerio doesn't have an "embedded jQuery"
[14:29:48] <ajpiano> it just works like jQuery
[14:30:13] <Mikeumus> ok
[14:34:01] <Mage_Dude> Ok rubber duck. I start off by attaching a .click() to a fake button. I take a blank form and clone() it, then give it a new random ID. I then have a helper function that accepts a string for the new random ID.
[14:34:50] <Mage_Dude> This function takes the string, adds a '#' and calls $(newSelector).validate({someOptions...})
[14:35:09] <relipse> i am in desperate need of a slide-to-unlock type button for mobile devices, an help?
[14:36:18] <Mage_Dude> A sprinkling of console.logs() seems to indicate that the .validate() function is successfully completed, yet, when the cloned form has input...the validation doesn't seem to 'fire'
[14:38:33] <coldhead> Mage_Dude: and you're sure it's validating the right cloned form? console.log( $(generated_id) ) yields the expected result?
[14:38:41] <Mage_Dude> I even tried a direct call in beforeSend to manually validate the form and still nothing. Whuurd I go wrong ducky?
[14:38:44] <Foxhoundz> I never knew the console object had an assert() method
[14:39:37] <Che-Anarch> I am trying to do depth / level based menu system using popup's... via event.preventDefault(); ... then $(this).attr('href').popup("open"); and although my first popup remains open it doesnt invoke 2nd top popup.
[14:40:01] <coldhead> Mage_Dude: i would also try calling it barebones with the simplest default config possible before adding any AJAX options back in
[14:40:12] <Mage_Dude> coldhead: Ah ha! It does not yield the correct element, but a blank Object []
[14:40:12] <coldhead> just to verify that it's doing ANYTHING validatey
[14:40:17] <coldhead> bam
[14:40:25] <coldhead> are you missing the '#'?
[14:40:30] <Mage_Dude> coldhead: It works with no magic sprinkles :)
[14:40:32] <coldhead> or do you have too many '#'s?
[14:41:14] <coldhead> you don't HAVE to select by id, you know. you could do $( my_cloned_form ).appendTo('#somewhere').validate()
[14:41:15] <Mage_Dude> No, but, I should have thought of ensuring not that 'something' is logged to the console, but that what I *expect* $("#something") is logged there...
[14:41:25] <Che-Anarch> Is there anyway I can prevent certian popups from auto disappearing when annother #popup is invoked?
[14:43:21] <jim_j> hi
[14:44:27] <coldhead> Che-Anarch: not aware of any official way to do it, but i'd look at if ($('.important_popup).is(':visible')) to avoid showing the less important ones
[14:45:28] <nocturne7> what does this do exactly:  "var o = $({});" ?
[14:45:31] <coldhead> bot-t1: sup
[14:45:31] <bot-t1> Not much dude, jusâ€™ hanginâ€™ â€™nâ€™ chillinâ€™
[14:45:37] <nocturne7> does it create a jquery object?
[14:45:47] <jim_j> what's the best way to trigger an 'on click' event when a page loads?
[14:46:24] <coldhead> yes nocturne7
[14:46:29] <coldhead> although i'm not sure why you'd do that
[14:46:56] <coldhead> $(window).load(function () { $('#something').trigger('click'); });
[14:47:00] <coldhead> or words to that effect
[14:47:06] <nocturne7> coldhead, the guy here does that http://goo.gl/NUzVt
[14:47:21] <Che-Anarch> coldhead   is there anyway I can prevent the curent layer from disappearing? like event.preventDefault()  ?  I have that on the $('#btnLINK').on('click', function(event) {....
[14:47:31] <Mage> anyone use jsfiddle a lot here? im wondering if theres something im missing with it
[14:49:08] <relipse> i am in desperate need of a slide-to-unlock type button for mobile devices, an help?
[14:49:11] <nocturne7> coldhead, do you see why that developer might have written some code like that ?
[14:49:23] <fission6> how do i hide all <tr> below the first one clicked
[14:55:00] <coldhead> nocturne7: he's doing it because he knows how to use apply()
[14:55:06] <coldhead> and he's showing off, basically
[14:55:09] <coldhead> ?mdc apply
[14:55:18] <coldhead> oh thanks for nothing bot-t1
[14:55:30] <coldhead> nocturne7: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[14:56:53] <dblosevn> hey anybody know of a neat ui statusbar widget?
[14:57:03] <nocturne7> yeah, I know how to use apply too :)
[14:57:38] <coldhead> show off :P
[14:59:16] <dblosevn> somehting I can dock to the bottom of my content view with columns and stuff
[14:59:43] <dblosevn> preferably with an api that makes it easy to update the status text in a column
[15:00:00] <fission6> http://jsfiddle.net/kM379/1/ how would i make all the <tr> fade out for separator rows
[15:00:23] <nocturne7> it looks pretty goofy actually
[15:02:17] <coldhead> <tr>s are notoriously difficult to animate
[15:02:23] <fission6> what does nocturne7
[15:02:23] <jim_j> is there an easy jquery form validation function out there?
[15:02:24] <fission6> http://jsfiddle.net/kM379/2/
[15:02:25] <Burton_> anyone have a moment for question(s) about Jquery.UI.Spinner? I am trying to get get it to AutoHide like the Brant Burnett version and wondering anyone might have any ideas.
[15:02:27] <coldhead> it's usually better to animate the children of the <tr>s
[15:03:07] <coldhead> jim_j: this is the most popular old battlehorse http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[15:03:14] <coldhead> it mostly Just Works
[15:03:15] <fission6> i have to have a row that goes across the whole table
[15:03:37] <fission6> this doesn't seem to bad no? http://jsfiddle.net/kM379/2/
[15:03:40] <jim_j> cold head, thanks!  I was just reading this:  http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation#Validate_forms_like_you.27ve_never_been_validating_before.21  is that ok too?
[15:04:01] <coldhead> that's the same one
[15:04:27] <jim_j> coldhead, ah cool!  :)
[15:06:57] <nocturne7> fission6, the code of the subscribe plugin to which I posted a link
[15:13:49] <fission6> nocturne7: i don't see it
[15:14:06] <fission6> also why does it look goovy
[15:14:35] <jim_j> coldhead, I copied the html as is and it's not triggering the jquery validation.  any idea what's missing?  http://www.imec.com/test/index.html
[15:15:43] <coldhead> it works for me jim_j
[15:15:51] <jim_j> hmm
[15:16:08] <coldhead> i see "This field is required." when i submit
[15:16:35] <jim_j> I was expected a traditional javascript popup, is that not available with this?
[15:17:08] <fission6> nocturne7: sorry i don't see you rlink
[15:17:28] <jim_j> and specific field messaging, like for email
[15:18:06] <coldhead> you can write your own messages, they're in the HTML
[15:18:20] <fission6> my code seems to work nicely so
[15:18:28] <coldhead> if you want to show the traditional (awful) popup you need to provide a function for validate() that does whatever you require
[15:18:36] <coldhead> in this case, that shows the (awful) popup
[15:19:21] <jim_j> coldhead, cool let me try that.  might not use the popup version if it's too annoying
[15:19:52] <coldhead> it definitely is
[15:20:12] <coldhead> jim_j: if you can target modern browsers you can use some nice HTML5 validation without needing JS at all
[15:20:24] <coldhead> html5 required attribute for example
[15:20:28] <coldhead> give that a google
[15:20:42] <jim_j> google 'html5 attribute' ?
[15:20:53] <coldhead> the keyword required
[15:20:56] <coldhead> would be good too
[15:22:02] <jim_j> this?  http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_form_attributes.asp
[15:22:35] <coldhead> sure, why not
[15:22:47] <coldhead> i'm not saying you SHOULD use that, just that you might consider it
[15:23:49] <nocturne7> fission6, np
[15:23:55] <fission6> wait huh?
[15:23:56] <fission6> haha
[15:24:05] <fission6> i am asking for what link you wanted me to review
[15:24:13] <coldhead> jim_j: try this in chrome for example: http://jsfiddle.net/7pcTX/
[15:24:15] <coldhead> no JS required
[15:25:01] <jim_j> wholly cow that's awesome!
[15:25:51] <coldhead> and lazy <3
[15:26:01] <coldhead> it is literally the complete cow
[15:26:37] <jim_j> that's exactly what I needed and it's cool that mobile devices can see this.  thanks
[15:27:07] <coldhead> <input type="number"> is excellent on mobile
[15:27:14] <coldhead> it brings up JUST a numeric keyboard
[15:29:36] <jim_j> coldhead, what about checkbox fields?
[15:30:10] <coldhead> what about them?
[15:30:40] <jim_j> if I put the 'required' parameter on a checkbox field it will be required to be checked?
[15:30:45] <coldhead> yes
[15:30:49] <jim_j> cool
[15:30:54] <coldhead> try it and see :)
[15:31:00] <jim_j> let's see :)
[15:31:08] <coldhead> "Please check this box if you wish to proceed"
[15:34:26] <jim_j> cool, yep it works
[15:34:46] <jim_j> is the 'this box' customizable or the html5 is generic?
[15:34:49] <awc737> does anyone use FooTable?
[15:34:55] <jim_j> I mean the initial message
[15:35:04] <jim_j> 'this field', 'this box'
[15:35:49] <Windows7_8> How do I do relative ajax requests?
[15:35:59] <Windows7_8> I have an app on www.domain.com/myapp
[15:36:13] <Windows7_8> Do I do /controller/action, or no prefix of / ?
[15:36:48] <jim_j> and is there a type 'zip code'
[15:36:54] <JFranks> http://jqueryui.com/accordion/#collapsible .. the collapsible option works great to 'allow' all content to be collapsed. How can I load it with all content collapsed or what's the 'cleanest' way to collapse it post loading?
[15:38:18] <JFranks> http://jsfiddle.net/pSrYd/
[15:39:53] <coldhead> jim_j: i don't think there's a zipcode input type but you can probably find the attributes you need to support it if you ask google
[15:40:03] <jim_j> cool
[15:40:07] <coldhead> you can't customise the messages if you use these html5 attributes
[15:40:11] <coldhead> that's one of the downsides
[15:40:17] <coldhead> but the plus side is it's easier
[15:41:42] <fission6> nocturne7: you around
[15:42:12] <JFranks>     $( "#accordion" ).accordion({
[15:42:13] <JFranks>       collapsible: true,
[15:42:13] <JFranks>       active: false
[15:42:13] <JFranks>     });
[15:42:15] <JFranks> Oops
[15:42:44] <coldhead> could be worse, JFranks
[15:45:37] <nocturne7> fission6, yeah
[15:45:50] <coldhead> COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY
[15:45:55] <coldhead> TRANSATIONAL ANALYSIS
[15:45:58] <fission6> what were you saying about my code before? you also mentioned a link
[15:46:07] <fission6> http://jsfiddle.net/kM379/2/
[15:47:26] <nocturne7> fission6, I was commenting on some else's code, not yours
[15:47:31] <fission6> oh ok
[15:50:33] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's take a short break
[15:51:22] <JFranks> I'd have to freeze my shorts to make them 'break'..
[15:52:21] <coldhead> starch?
[15:57:50] <daveace> yo, when i return an object using ajax, how do i split it up into rows to use in jquery
[15:58:29] <daveace> i understand how to split up one row using $.parseJSON and grabbing each value via obj['key']..
[15:59:13] <daveace> i did ask this earlier but i went about it anotherway that works, but ive been told i should return the whole db and sort it out in jquery
[15:59:30] <lz> daveace, you can use a for loop to iterate through each key:value pair
[15:59:50] <daveace> buti want all the values from ID=1 for instance
[15:59:57] <daveace> this is the thing
[16:00:09] <daveace> it returns multiple keys of the same value
[16:00:18] <lz> "for key in object" will iterate through each key:value pair in the object
[16:00:37] <lz> then inside the for loop you can refer to the current value by using object[key]
[16:00:54] <JFranks> if(obj['ID'] = 1) then { console.log('this is it');}else{ //not it }
[16:01:17] <daveace> but what about all the other key/values that come with id 1
[16:01:45] <ner0x> How can I get an array from a data-varname dom attribute?
[16:01:57] <JFranks> That's a 'data' problem and you can either hodge podge a solution (I always want the first ID=1!) or fix the data?
[16:02:40] <daveace> i get returned data like {"ID=1", "data=blah","data2=blah"}{"ID=2","data=blergggh","data2=blergh"}
[16:02:51] <daveace> i want everything between the first {}
[16:02:57] <JFranks> In that example there is only one ID = 1
[16:03:11] <daveace> yeah
[16:04:19] <JFranks> So.. if(obj['ID'] = 1) then { console.log('ID: '+obj['ID']+', Data: '+onj['data']+', Data2: '+onj['data2']);}else{ //not it }
[16:04:38] <JFranks> er s/onj/obj/
[16:05:08] <daveace> i dont understand how it splits or sees the data
[16:05:26] <daveace> how do it know idont want  obj['data'] from id =2
[16:05:33] <daveace> i think that's the problem
[16:05:42] <JFranks> You need to know. ;)
[16:06:03] <daveace> it looks like a hash if it was like..
[16:06:17] <daveace> i get returned data like set1:{"ID=1", "data=blah","data2=blah"}  set2:{"ID=2","data=blergggh","data2=blergh"}
[16:06:26] <daveace> i'd understand
[16:06:39] <coldhead> you don't get data returned like that though
[16:06:43] <coldhead> that's not valid JSON
[16:06:57] <coldhead> if you pastebin the actual output somewhere we can help you traverse it better
[16:07:09] <daveace> i have it working, but i send multiple requests to the server on button click
[16:07:24] <daveace> the reason i didnt request the whole database and go through it like that was because of this stumbling block
[16:07:26] <coldhead> jimmy carter
[16:07:37] <daveace> i couldn't even find an example (i have been searchin for the last couple of days)
[16:07:43] <daveace> so i just took the easier way
[16:08:03] <coldhead> we might be able to help you fix the code in a nice way if we can see it?
[16:08:04] <daveace> but i think it would be pretty useful for me to understand how to do it by returning lots of rows
[16:08:21] <JFranks> Yeah so a while loop takes the 'response' as an object converted from JSON, and loops over it, each loop returning the current value for the current pointer in the object to a variable called 'obj', and then you'd do the if/then/else check to see if the ID inside the obj is what you want, if so, then there's data you want to fetch..
[16:08:43] <JFranks> er 'array'/'object' called 'obj' .. ;)
[16:08:57] <daveace> right, so when it loops, it's actually looping over each { }
[16:09:06] <daveace> not each key/value pair?
[16:09:09] <JFranks> Sure.. that's one way to look at it
[16:09:35] <daveace> k if that's the case, now it makes sense
[16:09:39] <JFranks> No those are inside that {} .. which you'd get at with more logic..
[16:09:51] <daveace> no or not ?
[16:10:34] <daveace> i think i should go sleep
[16:10:41] <daveace> right cheers, i think that's cleared it up a bit more
[16:10:50] <coldhead> daveace: http://jsfiddle.net/p9kWY/
[16:10:54] <daveace> i apologise if i come in and ask again
[16:11:21] <coldhead> hej chee
[16:11:24] <daveace> ah
[16:11:38] <daveace> so it does just treat it as an array
[16:11:39] <JFranks> Response = { {id=1,data='foo',data2='bar'},{id=2,data='poo',data2='boy'},etc..}  .. If you did a while loop with 'response' as 'obj' then in the first loop 'obj['id']' is 1
[16:11:57] <coldhead> an array of objects
[16:12:08] <daveace> okay okay
[16:12:15] <coldhead> good luck daveace!
[16:12:16] <daveace> yes, why did it take me so long to grasp that
[16:12:28] <daveace> right cheers both of you
[16:12:29] <daveace> nn
[16:13:14] <chee> hej ColdHead

[16:23:49] <arthurbrown> Does anyone know why I can't assign methods to a variable and call later - such as v = $(-).addClass; v('the-class');
[16:24:04] <arthurbrown> I assume it has to do with the chaining reference stack, but unsure
[16:25:54] <gnarf> arthurbrown: yup, you assume correctly
[16:26:08] <gnarf> when you say "thing.method()" you are calling method in the context of thing
[16:26:36] <gnarf> when you say "var a = thing.method(); a()" you are calling method in the global context (window)
[16:26:46] <gnarf> you could actually still do this...
[16:27:05] <gnarf> "var a = thing.method(); a.call( thing )" calls method in context of thing again
[16:27:21] <gnarf> what is this for tho?
[16:27:31] <gnarf> if you are doing like addClass | removeClass ?
[16:27:32] <fission6> how do i transform this code to be "live" meaning the selectors work when the dom is changed and has matching elements http://dpaste.org/oI9EP/
[16:27:53] <gnarf> do something like thing[ test ? "addClass" : "removeClass" ]();
[16:27:53] <JFranks> relipse: http://jsfiddle.net/rVCA4/
[16:28:39] <gnarf> fission6: depends on what you're doing... for events, you can use delegation
[16:28:43] <gnarf> for anything else
[16:28:45] <fission6> toggleClass is good too
[16:28:50] <fission6> its events
[16:28:51] <gnarf> also yeah
[16:29:03] <gnarf> thing.toggleClass( "name", true/false ) works too
[16:29:06] <fission6> for clicks hover ofers
[16:29:28] <arthurbrown> gnarf: yeah exactly
[16:29:36] <arthurbrown> gnarf: your test? example
[16:30:11] <gnarf> `toggleClass @arthurbrown
[16:30:22] <gnarf> `api toggleClass @arthurbrown
[16:30:23] <b-ot> arthurbrown: .toggleClass(): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[16:30:39] <gnarf> look at the second signature
[16:30:51] <gnarf> thing.toggleClass( "name", test )
[16:30:53] <arthurbrown> gnarf: thank you - hadn't realized toggleclass took a boolean switch
[16:31:51] <gnarf> arthurbrown: but yeah, context ;)

[16:32:23] <dblosevn> anybody know of a good ui status bar plugin, been searching for hours and havent been very successful in finding anything
[16:33:47] <gnarf> dblosevn: status bar?
[16:34:21] <dblosevn> kind of like whats commonly seen in windows apps, a bar at the bottom of the view with columns and random tidbits of status info
[16:34:49] <gnarf> dblosevn: need a plugin for that? sounds like some css to me
[16:35:42] <dblosevn> eg, File Changed | Request in progress | (fillwidth) | (red or green icons to illustrate sending and recieving data)
[16:35:55] <dblosevn> ya im about at the point of writing it
[16:36:08] <gnarf> seems like just some <span>'s that you can .toggleClass on
[16:36:18] <gnarf> and .text()
[16:36:53] <dblosevn> ya i was just hoping there was something out there already that had a decent api
[16:36:59] <gnarf> i was thinking you wanted something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/Md98w/
[16:37:11] <gnarf> where's mekwall when you need him anyway
[16:37:21] <mekwall> im here :)
[16:37:39] <ner0x> What's the most efficient way to split a list of numbers and have them be integers?
[16:38:04] <mekwall> ner0x, a string of numbers?
[16:38:12] <gnarf> mekwall: I'm working on updating the widget factory presentation
[16:38:26] <gnarf> mekwall: going to any jQuery conf's anytime soon? :)
[16:38:35] <dblosevn> something like $('#bar').status({cols: [{position: 'left', name: 'info'}, {position: 'left', name: 'dirtystat'}, {position: 'right', name: 'ajaxstat'}]});
[16:39:21] <mekwall> ner0x, if its a string... then something like: var numarr = "543623243".splt("").map(function(){ return parseInt(this, 10); });
[16:39:41] <mekwall> gnarf: so far from sweden :(
[16:40:03] <gnarf> mekwall: yeah... i'm riding 8 planes in 2 weeks
[16:40:07] <gnarf> :/
[16:40:19] <mekwall> ouch
[16:40:23] <ner0x> mekwall: That works. Thank you.
[16:40:26] <gnarf> but, vienna, toronto... yay!
[16:40:31] <mekwall> :)
[16:40:33] <dblosevn> $('#bars').status().update('dirtystat', 'File has changed please save changes');
[16:40:38] <mekwall> not sure i'm going to the states this year
[16:40:45] <dblosevn> but i guess thats too much to ask for lol
[16:40:47] <mekwall> might go for e3, but it depends
[16:41:07] <gnarf> dblosevn: i think its overdesigning it... you could do it with some css framework
[16:41:10] <gnarf> some classes
[16:41:12] <gnarf> and some names
[16:41:17] <gnarf> and some data- fields
[16:42:44] <mekwall> data fields are pretty awesome
[16:43:26] <ner0x> mekwall: Why the extra 10 in the parseint?
[16:43:39] <gnarf> ner0x: never use parseInt without , 10
[16:43:54] <gnarf> ner0x: use parseFloat...
[16:44:00] <mekwall> ner0x: try changing it :P
[16:44:04] <relipse> how do i detect when my drag has dragged to the edge of the screen?
[16:44:12] <mekwall> ner0x: its the radix
[16:44:18] <gnarf> js> print( parseInt( "070" ) )
[16:44:19] <mekwall> ner0x: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[16:44:20] <b-ot> gnarf: 56
[16:44:27] <mekwall> hehe
[16:44:32] <gnarf> js> print( parseInt( "070", 10 ) )
[16:44:34] <b-ot> gnarf: 70
[16:44:44] <ner0x> Fair enough.
[16:44:45] <gnarf> js> print( parseInt( "0xff" ) )
[16:44:47] <ner0x> Thank you sirs.
[16:44:48] <b-ot> gnarf: 255
[16:44:59] <fission6> so how do i do live selects in case the dom changes for something like http://dpaste.org/oI9EP/
[16:45:43] <gnarf> fission6: you call a function that does that every time your dom changes
[16:45:53] <fission6> oh ok
[16:45:57] <fission6> that could work
[16:46:04] <fission6> how do i set up an handler fro that
[16:46:06] <gnarf> fission6: you just make it find only stuff in the "new content"
[16:46:09] <mekwall> fission6: don't use delegated binds unless you really have to (or when it actually makes sense)
[16:46:16] <fission6> ok
[16:46:31] <fission6> so what would that look like gnarf
[16:47:11] <gnarf> fission6: function newContent( content ) { content.find( ".link" ).addBack(".link").each(...); }
[16:47:16] <mekwall> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/uzfRP/
[16:47:18] <gnarf> fission6: function newContent( content ) { content.find( ".link" ).addBack(".link").each(...); return content; }
[16:47:27] <mekwall> thats how I build my plugs nowadays
[16:48:00] <gnarf> mekwall: widget factory rules ;)
[16:48:03] <fission6> how do i capture the dom modified even to do that though
[16:48:14] <fission6> i don't have direct assess to the even causing the re rendering
[16:48:17] <gnarf> fission6: there isn't one
[16:48:27] <gnarf> fission6: no event
[16:48:30] <gnarf> fission6: you have to call it
[16:48:35] <gnarf> when the document changes
[16:48:40] <gnarf> with the new content
[16:48:50] <fission6> well i can't easily seem to do that when angular renders a template
[16:48:50] <gnarf> if you don't know when that happens
[16:48:57] <gnarf> i doubt this
[16:49:02] <gnarf> there is probably a callback
[16:49:05] <gnarf> you can listen for
[16:49:14] <mekwall> gnarf: what drove me away from jquery ui are the incredible amount of classes being used everywhere... feels bloated
[16:49:20] <gnarf> `g angular render callback
[16:49:20] <b-ot> gnarf: angularjs - is there a post render callback for Angular JS directive ... â†’ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11125078/is-there-a-post-render-callback-for-angular-js-directive
[16:50:07] <chee> i was not aware of this widget library
[16:50:35] <gnarf> mekwall: widget factory has so much utility tho
[16:50:49] <fission6> yea there isn't a decent means gnarf
[16:50:51] <gnarf> mekwall: and very little bloat, no dependency on others...
[16:50:58] <gnarf> fission6: lame
[16:51:03] <fission6> yea
[16:51:15] <mekwall> gnarf: sure, that's true
[16:51:26] <gnarf> i mean
[16:51:33] <gnarf> your proto is a simple object
[16:51:39] <gnarf> and it does the bridge part for you
[16:52:29] <gnarf> actually
[16:52:35] <gnarf> i got a random idea
[16:52:54] <gnarf> we need a better pattern for reading widget options from data- attribs
[16:53:02] <gnarf> you in ui-dev ?
[16:54:40] <jim_j> is this not valid?  jQuery('.login-class\).first.show('slow');
[16:54:55] <jim_j> I mean jQuery('.login-class').first.show('slow');
[16:54:59] <gnarf> jim_j: yes, it is not valid
[16:55:03] <gnarf> first is a method
[16:55:06] <gnarf> .first()
[16:55:25] <jim_j> thanks!
[16:56:11] <mekwall> jim_j: you can also do jQuery('.login-class:first').show('slow');
[16:56:41] <jim_j> mekwall, cool, thanks
[16:56:44] <Che-Anarch> I noticed at the bottom of the docs on popups it states: "Chaining of popups not allowed"... but the solution with the setTimeout doesnt seem to work... I am trying to do a single level popup menu.
[16:57:00] <jim_j> bbr
[16:57:01] <jim_j> brb
[16:57:07] <jim_j> both work btw
[16:57:34] <mekwall> gnarf: gotta run off to bed! later :)
[17:01:43] <__alex> karolyi: greetings
[17:03:28] <ner0x> mekwall: How against coffeescript are you?
[17:03:46] <mekwall> ner0x: not at all... I use it myself at times
[17:03:54] <nocturne7> coldhead, I know now why the author uses "$({})"
[17:04:18] <ner0x> mekwall: I'm trying to use that code you just showed me but i'm getting NaN, Nan. One second while I generate a paste?
[17:04:36] <nocturne7> can't do smth like '$.on("custom.bb", function(){})'
[17:04:38] <mekwall> make it quick :P gotta run off to bed
[17:05:35] <ner0x> mekwall: https://gist.github.com/fswitalski/4982193
[17:05:55] <ner0x> mekwall: I think the issue is on line 22 @ is referring to the original table, not the current string.
[17:08:31] <mekwall> ner0x: thats weird... you aren't using =>
[17:08:43] <ner0x> mekwall: Not using => ?
[17:09:01] <mekwall> ner0x: yeah, if you would have been using => then @ would be referring to the original table
[17:09:02] <gnarf> mekwall: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.widget.js#L22-L40
[17:09:18] <gnarf> mekwall: there's reading options from data-* after a little tweaking
[17:09:26] <ner0x> mekwall: I don't know coffeescript all too well. It's one of those things I've been meaning to delve into.
[17:09:41] <mekwall> gnarf: cool! looking forward to it :D
[17:11:25] <mekwall> ner0x: well I don't know what's wrong... and I gotta run to bed. good luck!
[17:11:47] <ner0x> mekwall: I figured it out. :)
[17:12:58] <fir_ed> One of my click handlers is not activating unless I paste it into console -> http://pastie.org/6219903
[17:13:04] <fir_ed> Could someone please look into it?
[17:33:09] <jim_j> hi
[17:36:50] <jim_j> I'm trying to have an email match the second email in a form, using 'equalTo'.  what's the issue?  http://jsfiddle.net/ydyMf/
[17:41:55] <veQue> i'm looking to make an on-screen backspace key
[17:42:04] <veQue> researching it now.
[17:43:31] <xenaxon> hi
[17:43:31] <xenaxon> does anybody know how to make arbor.js work
[17:44:02] <xenaxon> I'm finding arbor.js very difficult to make a working one
[17:44:04] <jim_j> this is the form;  http://www.imec.com/test/test.html  trying to enforce email1 and email2 to match
[17:44:07] <xenaxon> http://arborjs.org/
[17:44:16] <djQuery> is there a bug with var x = new Date(), y = x.getYear();   its setting y = 113 instead of 2013
[17:45:17] <mlr> djQuery:  use  x.getFullYear();   instead
[17:46:25] <djQuery> mlr, ahhh thanks
[17:46:40] <mlr> djQuery no prob!
[17:48:26] <xenaxon> how can I reproduce this: http://arborjs.org/
[17:48:33] <xenaxon> guys any help is appreciated
[17:52:58] <veQue> is there any obvious known reason why using my keyboard to input in a text input field would work fine in firefox but not chrome?
[17:57:00] <ogk1000> so this code I have works fine but I feel there has to be a way to write it cleaner with less redundancy.. any ideas? http://collabedit.com/qnhep
[18:08:30] <jim_j> anyone know what's wrong with my jquery validation?  http://jsfiddle.net/7pcTX/1/
[18:10:08] <runvnc> javascript
[18:11:16] <jim_j> bad javascript?
[18:17:23] <veQue> weird text input works fine in firefox and ie bu not in chrome
[18:17:26] <veQue> what gives?
[18:26:58] <awc737> wow writing pagination is hurting my head
[18:29:12] <coldhead> veQue: badly formed HTML?
[18:29:37] <veQue> i amkinda doubting that
[18:29:44] <veQue> think it's a chrome thing
[18:30:03] <veQue> gonna take 5
[18:30:57] <coldhead> enjoy
[18:32:07] <yogurt_truck> quitter!
[18:35:43] <jim_j> hey coldhead, am I missing something for email address equalTo here?  http://jsfiddle.net/7pcTX/2/
[18:36:47] <veQue> >_>
[18:36:53] <veQue> i'm no quitter
[18:39:03] <coldhead> jim_j: you seem to be missing actually including the plugin in your fiddle
[18:39:18] <coldhead> i added it here http://jsfiddle.net/7pcTX/3/
[18:39:21] <coldhead> still doesn't work
[18:39:23] <coldhead> not sure why
[18:39:28] <coldhead> i haven't worked with rules in a long time
[18:40:21] <Che-Anarch> in jqm is there anyway of setting dialogs to have transparent background showing where it was invoked from?
[18:40:52] <veQue> a stackoverflow gem "For completeness sake, this covers all supporting browsers (IE is not considered a web browser):"
[18:42:17] <djQuery> coldhead, jim_j    whats not working abou this http://jsfiddle.net/7pcTX/4/
[18:42:32] <veQue> found the problem in css   -webkit-user-select: none; -< doesnt work in chrome
[18:43:11] <djQuery> added novalidate to the form so that the validation plugin would validate it instead of the browser
[18:45:37] <djQuery> NM you are trying to force the 2 fields to be equal right
[18:45:38] <coldhead> djQuery: it doesn't ensure the email address is entered the same way twice
[18:45:42] <dteric> hi - looking for a reccomendation on a jquery slider - needs to do touch/swipe, horiz/vertical and have up to 30 per page
[18:48:31] <veQue> whats better responsive design or redirection to mobile site?
[18:48:49] <dteric> veQue: depends on the content being shown
[18:48:58] <veQue> ok
[18:49:50] <coldhead> veQue: responsive is less work than maintaining two sites
[18:50:17] <veQue> ahh good point
[18:54:56] <yogurt_truck> that depends on the intended design
[18:55:41] <coldhead> the intended design is the one where i have to do the least work possible
[18:55:59] <coldhead> basically just black text on a white background, no images, no functionality
[18:56:01] <coldhead> a single page
[18:56:59] <yogurt_truck> my main project right now is responsive and I control the design so it's OK. but I worked on a project for the last half of 2012 where the client came to us with a complex responsive design that wasn't simple at all and looking back it should have been a simple two-separate designs project
[18:58:41] <veQue> also a good point
[18:59:28] <veQue> @_@ brain is slowly remembering....
[18:59:43] <veQue> javascript posting site name
[19:00:08] <veQue> which i've used dozens of times and is embarressed to ask
[19:00:55] <veQue> jsfiddle >_>
[19:00:58] <veQue> shhhh
[19:01:38] <veQue> had a bookmark some months back before i crashed my hard drive
[19:02:08] <awc737> now there is smoke coming out my ears: http://screencloud.net/v/uIQk
[19:06:28] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/qq7Px/ apparently -webkit-user-select:none; prevents typing in a text box while in chrome
[19:06:42] <veQue> i'm  just looking for something that prevents text highlighting
[19:07:11] <coldhead> unplug the mouse?
[19:07:40] <veQue> wouldnt stop touchpad users
[19:08:00] <coldhead> damn
[19:08:06] <coldhead> those guys are always a step ahead
[19:20:49] <veQue> screw it i'm not gonna worry about it, clients asked for an app, dont know why it needs to work on chrome anyway. i guess they just dont get it this is what i get for talkoing through a middleman
[19:21:47] <veQue> i only allowed them to see it for basic critique, not nitpicky things
[19:22:06] <awc737> yeah,no one uses chrome...
[19:22:13] <veQue> >_>
[19:22:37] <veQue> it's gonna be an app. mobile app
[19:23:10] <veQue> just was showing a version before it was completly ported through phonegap
[19:23:57] <veQue> another thing. the buttons should be square and not rectangle ?.... they will be square on a phone
[19:24:10] <veQue> they squish into little squares see
[19:24:13] <veQue> lol
[19:25:51] <christophe_v_e> Hey, I'm wondering if there's an alternative to lightbox/slimbox/ .. anything box really - to just click on an image to enlarge it.
[20:02:00] * pyxorg is away: Silence, I'm emerging!
[20:02:07] <GoSox> how can i check if a specific $("#thing") is NOT checked? (it's a checkbox of course)
[20:04:14] <Gavilan2> Is there any way to modify the styles associated with a CSS class via JQuery?
[20:23:01] <tw2113> ?css @ Gavilan2
[20:23:12] <tw2113> no bots?
[20:23:26] <tw2113> check .css() Gavilan2
[20:23:38] <kurol> css?
[20:23:49] <GoSox> what events are generated when you check a checkbox?
[20:24:06] <kurol> whoe not $("#thing:not:is:checked")... i think... not sure how `not` works
[20:24:27] <kurol> a regular old click event
[20:24:37] <kurol> + mouse events
[20:24:48] <kurol> nothing special
[20:34:48] <coldhead> good chat

[20:39:10] <hip2p> lol what the hell was that
[20:39:22] <tw2113> someone with a microscopic peepee
[20:39:25] <systemfault> A classic flooder.
[20:39:39] <hip2p> I dunno about classic, the guy apparently was targeting rmartinez
[20:39:43] <tw2113> snover...you're my hero
[20:43:09] <coldhead> if only we could understand his beautiful and strange monkey language
[20:54:24] * pyxorg is back (gone 00:52:24)
[20:54:46] <snover> thank goodness. i donâ€™t know what we did without you.
[20:54:46] <coldhead> welcome back pyxorg
[20:55:01] <coldhead> longest 0:52:24 of my life
[20:59:17] <pyxorg> hmm, sorry I ticked "Announce away messages" by mistake on my XChat preferences...
[21:01:43] <coldhead> i feel it brought us closer together
[21:01:47] <coldhead> as a community
[21:01:49] <coldhead> and as a species
[21:01:52] <coldhead> so thank you
[21:06:24] <tw2113> flexbox is hotness
[21:13:50] <tw2113> coldhead, http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/18rjb2/poll_which_quotation_marks_do_you_use_as_the_main/c8hfeth
[21:13:57] <coldhead> i just voted
[21:19:48] <jim_j> coldhead, yeah still not working
[21:23:19] <BillCriswell> I wonder what rmartinez did to upset that hoodoo dude or whatever.
[21:24:19] <hip2p> I have an accordion that's set up in a function. When this function is called at document ready, the accordion works fine. When the function is called later to update it, it no longer works. Why would this be?
[21:25:17] <coldhead> i think he owed him money
[21:26:23] <coldhead> hip2p: depends how it "doesn't work". it might be that some other lib is overwriting $, for example
[21:26:40] <hip2p> hmm
[21:27:56] <hip2p> apparently jqueryUI doesn't allow for content to be added dynamically to an accordion
[21:28:05] <jim_j> any other ideas for why the email match check isn't working?  http://jsfiddle.net/7pcTX/3/

[22:13:57] <relipse> <a href="#page_blah"> is one way by clicking link
[22:14:18] <b1lly> did you read the API doc?

[22:18:24] <Gavilan2> css?
[22:21:17] <Gavilan2> is there any way to get the absolute positions of an element? is there a way to get the "relative" position I should put to an element to get it into a particular absolute position? I'm looking to change the position type, without changing where the element is at....
[22:25:47] <djQuery> relipse relipse, <a href="#mypage" data-role="button" data-mini="true">clickme</a>
[22:27:11] <Gavilan2> Hi! Is there any link, manual, tutorial, reference or anything that suggest which CSS selectors, HTML properties, jQuery or JavaScript functions are faster in the different browsers, or in general? I have a page that I already created, and it's running slow, so I'm looking for things to optimize it... (I can't show the page, sorry)... Any material that contains that information?
[22:31:53] <maxmoore14> there any easy way to add multiple split buttons in a listview? http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/widgets/listviews/#list-split

[23:08:12] <ganeshu> can anyone give example of comet  long polling
[23:25:34] <motaka2> Hello I have written a piece of code to capture  ctl+s event to save something in Db, when the cursur is blinking in tinymce ctl+s doesn't work, what should I do ?
[23:36:48] <Cork> motaka2: you could try adding an event listener to the tinymce element
[23:37:13] <Cork> motaka2: it has built in handling of that key combo so it most likely does a stopPropagation()
[23:37:25] <motaka2> Cork: No I dont want to change the config of tinymce since I use it for several editors
[23:37:26] <Cork> either that or they'r using an iframe, with the same effect
[23:37:45] <Cork> motaka2: didn't say anything about changing its config
[23:38:07] <Cork> but you will have to have code to handle it
[23:48:35] <motaka2> Cork: I have no idea
[23:49:38] <jim_j> anyone know what's wrong with my checkbox validator check?  http://jsfiddle.net/7pcTX/6/
