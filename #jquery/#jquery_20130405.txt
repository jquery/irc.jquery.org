[00:02:33] <SCIF> As i see docs, live() must be replaced by delegate(), isn't it?
[00:03:32] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:07:41] <eddiemonge> SCIF: or .on()
[00:08:36] <SCIF> .on() just don't binds on future objects.
[00:10:04] <fabioportieri> SCIF: ?
[00:10:13] <fabioportieri> isn't supposed to replace .live ?
[00:10:55] <anli> .live should be replaced on only adding handlers to existing objects
[00:11:05] <anli> replaced on => replaced with
[00:11:13] <SCIF> fabioportieri: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements.
[00:11:14] <SCIF> .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements.
[00:11:42] <SCIF> anli: And for the future created must be used .delegate()?
[00:11:58] <anli> Where do you create the objects, why not add event handlers there?
[00:12:08] <anli> Its a lot cleaner
[00:12:42] <fabioportieri> oh, i see
[00:12:44] <SCIF> anli: Yeah. But i add objects as appending of html code.
[00:12:56] <anli> Sure, but you add them in a function you have written, right
[00:13:06] <SCIF> Nope.
[00:13:10] <eddiemonge> SCIF: read the whole page http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:13:17] <eddiemonge> anli: please dont tell people that
[00:13:23] <anli> eddiemonge: what?
[00:13:52] <eddiemonge> anli: sorry. misread your statement
[00:14:10] <anli> You append a string with html?
[00:14:14] <anli> Append objects instead
[00:14:29] <SCIF> anli:  I copy it from node which i search by selector.
[00:14:45] <anli> var div = $('<div/>'); div.click(fucntion(){ /*something */}); anotherdiv.append(div);
[00:14:58] <anli> oops, fucntion should be spelled function
[00:15:05] <SCIF> anli: Nope.
[00:15:29] <anli> You clone?
[00:15:32] <eddiemonge> SCIF: you dont need delegate: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[00:15:38] <SCIF> Something like: $('#ask_add_file').data('control', $('#ask_add_file').parent().next().html());
[00:15:38] <SCIF> 		$(this).parent().parent().children('div.controls').append($(this).data('control'));
[00:16:35] <anli> Ah, var html = $('#ask_add_file').parent().next().html()); var div=$(html); div.find('.poop').click(function() { /*whatever*/}); anotherdiv.append(div);
[00:16:38] <eddiemonge> var $this = $(this); $this.parent().siblings('div.controls').append($this.data('control'));
[00:16:47] <anli> Assuming you use the class poop
[00:17:08] <eddiemonge> SCIF: cache your selectors so you dont do extra lookups
[00:17:14] <anli> I always use classes so I can add event handlers easy this way
[00:17:30] <eddiemonge> .parent().children(selector) is the same as siblings(selector)
[00:17:30] <anli> Well, cache them so you dont have to write a lot of code
[00:17:41] <anli> eddiemonge: true, well catched
[00:17:51] <SCIF> Oh. And also: binding handlers happens in other $(function(){});
[00:18:04] <SCIF> Why you can't just give a answer??
[00:18:07] <eddiemonge> SCIF: did you read the link i sent you?
[00:18:14] <anli> Oh, I am out
[00:18:32] <SCIF> eddiemonge: Nope. Sorry. Open it now and will read in next few mins
[00:22:11] <SCIF> eddiemonge: Are you about that .live() is performance killer?
[00:22:48] <eddiemonge> .live() is deprecated and removed
[00:23:11] <eddiemonge> and yes its a performance killer because it binds to the document so every event has to be checked
[00:23:19] <SCIF> eddiemonge: But it replaced by .delegate()
[00:23:33] <eddiemonge> no. its replaced with on()
[00:23:36] <SCIF> I know that it's performance killer, but i need that :(
[00:24:31] <eddiemonge> huh?
[00:25:22] <anli> .live is more than a performance killer, its a declaration that "I dont care which event handlers I run" :)
[00:25:35] <SCIF> But .delegate() produces error: TypeError: a.replace is not a function
[00:25:36] <SCIF> ...{href:function(a){return a.getAttribute("href")},type:function(a){return a.getAt...
[00:26:01] <SCIF> anli: Yeah. And i ready to use it!
[00:26:14] <anli> Oh, you can always use an old jquery.js then
[00:26:30] <eddiemonge> SCIF: paste your code at jsfiddle or post a live link so i can see the actual error
[00:27:16] <eddiemonge> anli: thats not good advice. always use the latest jquery when possible
[00:27:28] <SCIF> I can't fast reproduce my construction on jsfiddle :(
[00:27:37] <anli> Yes, but he/she already chosed the fubared path
[00:28:00] <eddiemonge> anli: not necessarily
[00:28:18] <eddiemonge> SCIF: stop trying to use .delegate(). use .on() instead
[00:29:09] <eddiemonge> $(closestParentSelector that already exists).on('event', 'selectorThatIsAdded', function(e) { handler });
[00:29:39] <SCIF> eddiemonge: Remember you that my objects will be created in future and i can't add handler while will create object :(
[00:30:10] <anli> You dont want to, you can
[00:30:10] <SCIF> I can't add it to newely created objects :(
[00:31:29] <eddiemonge> SCIF: huh? use .on() to bind to the closest parent that exists when you bind the handler
[00:31:47] <anli> SCIF: I was telling you how you can
[00:33:20] <anli> Why do people prefer .on() before .click() .mousedown() etcc?
[00:33:31] <SCIF> I have simple structure: div.controls>div.form.
[00:34:59] <SCIF> At start i have only single div.form in div.controls.
[00:35:29] <eddiemonge> anli: because its faster
[00:35:40] <eddiemonge> click() etc all call .on() internally
[00:35:40] <SCIF> But by clicking on button, it copy div.form's code and place it to div.controls and i get div.controls>div.forn*2
[00:35:58] <anli> Ah, but I would never see a difference in speed
[00:36:23] <SCIF> And every div.form contains input which binds in plugin
[00:36:34] <eddiemonge> $('div.controls').on('submit', 'div.form', function(e) {  //validate form });
[00:36:52] <eddiemonge> anli: if you use it then you would. milliseconds add up
[00:36:59] <SCIF> eddiemonge: Nope. It's not validation
[00:37:08] <anli> Oh, if the user cannot see a difference, there is no difference
[00:37:10] <anli> :)
[00:37:38] <anli> It is also very hard to defend the internal usage of calling on
[00:37:43] <SCIF> anli: I'm about that tell you 100 posts above :(
[00:38:01] <anli> Check for scrollbar
[00:38:03] <anli> ;)
[00:38:04] <eddiemonge> SCIF: that was an example. use click instead of submit
[00:38:18] <anli> oh, sorry, misunderstood you SCIF
[00:38:40] <SCIF> eddiemonge: ???? What you about? submit? Nope. In plugin binds click()
[00:38:53] <eddiemonge> $('div.controls').on('click', 'div.form', function(e) {  //validate form });
[00:38:59] <eddiemonge> $('div.controls').on('click', 'div.form', function(e) {  //click handler });
[00:39:50] <SCIF> Every binding functions places in plugin which i can't edit!
[00:39:53] <eddiemonge> anli: its very easy when its the best way
[00:40:02] <eddiemonge> SCIF: i dont know what you want then
[00:40:08] <anli> But the best way is the one producing less code
[00:40:33] <anli> If the code does not run in an optimized way, the runtime environment has failed optimizing the execution
[00:40:45] <titii> Hi friends, is here someone who has some experience with facebook apps programming? I need help
[00:41:14] <SCIF> I know every weak sides of my decision but it's really not depends in my situation :(
[00:41:28] <eddiemonge> anli: actually the best way is the one that is more performant while still being readable
[00:41:48] <anli> Readability over everything, unless performance hits you in the back
[00:41:59] <anli> It seldom does for me
[00:43:32] <eddiemonge> i give up. i dont know why im arguing with you over everything. do it your way and if it works in your head then go with it, even if its not the best
[00:44:02] <SCIF> I use http://gregpike.net/demos/bootstrap-file-input/bootstrap.file-input.js and try to use it with newely created objects.
[00:44:13] <nights> is there a way to dynamically load css and get element style to change without reloading in the browser?
[00:44:19] <nights> (with jquery)
[00:44:57] <nights> i know of course its possible to load the css
[00:45:26] <nights> but is it possible to get the browser to use the new style without reloading?
[00:46:37] <nights> nm
[00:46:40] <nights> found solution
[00:46:43] <eddiemonge> SCIF: that is some bad code
[00:47:59] <titii> Friends, i need help with face application, how to post a feed from my app into user's wall?
[00:48:21] <eddiemonge> SCIF: https://github.com/grevory/bootstrap-file-input/issues/7
[00:48:21] <b-ot> eddiemonge: Issue #7 by troex (2mon 6d ago): Doesn't play nice with ajax forms
[00:48:44] <eddiemonge> titii: look in FB documentation
[00:49:29] <anli> True, no need for arguing
[00:49:36] <titii> eddiemonge: you know how to do that<
[00:50:13] <eddiemonge> look in the documentation? yeah go to https://developers.facebook.com/
[00:50:58] <titii> eddiemonge: u dont understand, i tried many examples from forums or tutorials, it doesnt works, thats the cause i am need help to ask someone
[00:52:42] <eddiemonge> check on stackoverflow
[00:53:01] <eddiemonge> or go to https://developers.facebook.com/support/
[01:12:47] <mkoks> hi, is someone familiar with this - http://multidatespickr.sourceforge.net/ ?
[01:13:35] <nights> cool
[01:13:45] <Pitel_IPEX> how can I write selector which will select all <a> which are not childrens of <table>? $(":not('table') a") doesn't work :(
[01:13:49] <nights> works so well to load dynamic css!
[01:15:02] <mkoks> $("a").not("table a") ?
[01:15:38] <Cork> or $('a').filter(function() { $(this).parents('table').length == 0; })
[01:16:12] <Pitel_IPEX> mkoks: thanks!
[01:16:24] <Cork> opps forgot a return there
[01:16:43] <mkoks> but does it work properly? that was more like a sketch xD
[01:17:03] <Pitel_IPEX> mkoks: yup, it works :)
[01:17:08] <mkoks> nice :)
[01:18:44] * AdamPDotty tried $(':not(table)'); , crashes Chrome
[01:20:29] <AdamPDotty> $('a:not(table a)'); does work
[01:20:41] <AdamPDotty> basically the same
[01:27:01] <DarsVaeda> is there an overview over available jquery(ui) versions
[01:28:07] <Cork> DarsVaeda: http://blog.jqueryui.com/
[01:28:45] <DarsVaeda> hmm yeah hmm
[01:30:28] <Cork> AdamPDotty: except that inline :functions is really show and should be avoided as long as possible
[01:32:17] <untaken_> I having difficulties with jquery issue and I am trying to it set it up on jsfiddle, but have difficulites doing that too. http://jsfiddle.net/tBVuV/ Why are my functions not being called when I click on the button? I am new to jsfiddle
[01:39:13] <untaken_> if I add the code to the JavaScript window, do I need do anything special when I do onclick="functionname()"
[01:39:32] <untaken_> is there JavaScript window loaded into the HTML window, I take it is
[01:48:20] <Cork> untaken_: use event listners instead of event attributes
[01:49:10] <Cork> and make sure that the function you call exist in the same scope as where you're binding your event listener
[01:49:20] <untaken_> ok
[01:49:36] <untaken_> I'll carry on a make example of my problem, using event listeners
[01:49:55] <Cork> function functionname() {}; $(document).on('load', functionname);
[01:52:50] <germ13> try this: tick_it = function() {    alert("test");    $("input[type=checkbox][name=100]").attr('checked', true); };
[01:53:40] <germ13> untick_it = function () {    alert("untick");    $("input[type=checkbox][name=100]").attr('checked', false); };
[01:59:58] <untaken_> well...
[02:00:07] <untaken_> I started again and have copied all my code over
[02:00:10] <untaken_> http://jsfiddle.net/tBVuV/12/
[02:00:20] <untaken_> problem is, it works on jsfiddle
[02:00:32] <untaken_> that is just an example of what I am after.
[02:01:20] <untaken_> my problem on the site I am working on, is that when I click the parent, then untick the parent, then tick the parent, it doesn't select all the subcategories. In jsfiddle it seems to work :(
[02:01:34] <Anticom> I'd even consider wrapping this into a plugin
[02:02:05] <Anticom> untaken_ nah, here in jsfiddle you can't select the last child ;)
[02:02:32] <untaken_> Anticom: what do you mean?
[02:02:37] <untaken_> it works for me
[02:02:47] <Anticom> i would give the input's a data-level="[depth in tree]" and write a plugin handling the management of the checkboxes then
[02:03:08] <Anticom> try to check test4 on its own
[02:03:11] <Anticom> doesn't select for me
[02:03:46] <untaken_> what browser?
[02:04:03] <Anticom> ff 19.0.2 (Win XP - 32 Bit)
[02:04:40] <untaken_> :( works for me though
[02:04:56] <Anticom> oh or you could even create the dom by feeding in some huge object
[02:05:04] <Anticom> that would make everything more managable
[02:05:38] <Cork> Anticom: your out of date ;P
[02:05:46] <Anticom> why?
[02:05:47] <Anticom> :O
[02:05:50] <Cork> 19 is eol
[02:05:57] <Anticom> ????
[02:06:54] <Cork> Anticom: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/20.0/releasenotes/
[02:06:55] <Anticom> i'd write a node class in plain js with refs to children and parents and a managing "checkbox-tree" (or call it whatever u like) jq plugin working with instances of that node class
[02:07:04] <Anticom> oh Cork yea i know
[02:07:43] <Anticom> i'd like to update but i've got a crawler running in my browser.... thing is i failed with programming and if i close the browser the script will abort ._.
[02:07:54] <Anticom> need to wait till it's done
[02:08:09] <Anticom> next time i'll directly go for cli script + nohup :D
[02:08:26] <daslicht> how do i fade in a replaceWith element ?
[02:09:03] <untaken_> ok
[02:09:11] <untaken_> thanks for the advice... I'll try and tackle this
[02:10:05] <Cork> daslicht: don't replace with
[02:10:12] <daslicht> :)
[02:10:20] <daslicht> whats the better approach ?
[02:10:30] <Cork> daslicht: i meant if you want to animate don't replaceWith
[02:10:36] <daslicht> how to just replace the content ?
[02:10:51] <daslicht> without using replaceWith
[02:10:54] <Cork> `api after
[02:10:55] <b-ot> Cork: .after(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[02:11:01] <Cork> `api remove
[02:11:01] <b-ot> Cork: .remove(): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[02:11:08] <daslicht> aye
[02:11:10] <daslicht> thanks
[02:11:14] <Cork> create the new content .hide() it
[02:11:22] <Cork> after it, animate the old and new
[02:11:26] <Cork> and remove the old
[02:11:29] <daslicht> wide will set display none ?
[02:11:49] <daslicht> i try that
[02:12:01] <Cork> unless you want to animate it manually, you should use .hide()
[02:12:18] <Cork> and not display: none;
[02:12:51] <daslicht> i want both
[02:12:56] <daslicht> fisrt animate opacity
[02:13:06] <Cork> .hide() sets display:none
[02:13:11] <daslicht> and than display none to get rid of its dimensions
[02:13:17] <Cork> the difference is that it stores the original display value
[02:13:25] <daslicht> cool
[02:13:38] <daslicht> i did it manually so far animate , displaynone ...
[02:13:39] <daslicht> :)
[02:13:41] <Cork> and .show/.slideDown/... uses the stored value to restore the display value to the original
[02:14:31] <Cork> so if for ex. you have an element that isn't block; if you don't use .hide() it will be block when .show shows it
[02:23:09] <daslicht> Cork: is there any suggested approch to reset a form with javascript ?
[02:25:37] <daslicht> i have found this: http://paste.ie/view/7192e8cb
[02:25:38] <dingdreher> hi, hello there, i guess $(#somespan).val() doesn't return anything if there are input childs?
[02:25:56] <Cork> daslicht: $('form')[0].reset()
[02:26:04] <daslicht> you want : $('#somespan')
[02:26:16] <daslicht> cool
[02:26:34] <dingdreher> but, $(#someselectfield).val() works?
[02:26:50] <Cork> `api serialzie @ dingdreher
[02:26:51] <b-ot> dingdreher: No matches.
[02:26:54] <Cork> uh...
[02:27:01] <Cork> opps
[02:27:08] <Cork> `api serialize @ dingdreher
[02:27:08] <b-ot> dingdreher: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[02:27:39] <Cork> dingdreher: val only returns one value, and it has to be ran directly on a form element
[02:27:50] <Cork> also there is serializeArray
[02:27:54] <Cork> `api serializeArray @ dingdreher
[02:27:54] <b-ot> dingdreher: .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[02:28:03] <dingdreher> ok. thank you guys, got it =)
[02:28:19] <dingdreher> and girls of course..
[02:28:23] <dingdreher> haha
[02:29:10] <daslicht> hm  $('form')[0].reset() doesnt rest my form ?
[02:29:24] <Cork> hmm
[02:29:35] <Cork> it should reset it to the state it was in when the form was loaded
[02:30:26] <daslicht> $('#edit_form')[0].reset() should taht work eiether?
[02:30:28] <daslicht> either
[02:30:58] <Cork> one sec
[02:31:10] <Cork> daslicht: http://jsfiddle.net/HgbjS/
[02:31:22] <Cork> the selector doesn't matter as long as it matches the form element
[02:31:47] <daslicht> looks like its something other
[02:31:52] <daslicht> i narrow it down
[02:32:12] <Cork> also note that if you want a reset button just <input type="reset" value="Reset"> works
[02:32:24] <Cork> (no need for js)
[02:32:46] <daslicht> $('#edit_form')[0].reset(); is doing the job :)
[02:33:05] <daslicht> i have to pages which i fade in out
[02:33:07] <daslicht> tab like
[02:33:18] <daslicht> on one is my form and on the other a event list
[02:33:26] <anli> daslicht: why [0]?
[02:33:32] <daslicht> i dont know
[02:33:35] <anli> ah
[02:33:37] <daslicht> :)
[02:33:39] <anli> :)
[02:33:41] <Cork> reset() is a dom function
[02:33:49] <Cork> not a jquery one
[02:34:06] <Cork> [0] grabs the first dom element in the jquery selector
[02:34:22] <daslicht> cool i do a console log onb that
[02:35:24] <daslicht> cool
[02:35:34] <daslicht> and again , learned something new
[02:35:39] <daslicht> thank you very much
[02:36:03] <Cork> just to be complete .eq() does almost the same thing
[02:36:21] <Cork> with the exception that it wraps it in a new jquery wrapper
[02:36:31] <Cork> `api eq
[02:36:32] <b-ot> Cork: .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[02:38:23] <seutje> so get does the exact same thing
[02:38:35] <seutje> with no exceptions aside from when u don't pass an index
[02:40:12] <Cork> get does the same thing as [], but with an overhead for no reason :)
[02:43:22] <seutje> of course
[02:43:29] <seutje> gotsa have them overheads
[02:44:00] <Cork> seutje: http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20130403
[02:45:10] <seutje> Cork: I don't get it :(
[02:45:40] <Cork> seutje: it starts here http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20130326
[02:49:11] <daslicht> that form reset down not do the job for me properly since i handle with teh same form aganin and again
[02:49:17] <daslicht> is therer a way to clean all values ?
[02:49:20] <seutje> Cork: ah, makes sense now :P
[02:49:43] <Cork> daslicht: what do you mean?
[02:50:06] <daslicht> actually i dont know why its still filled
[02:50:22] <Cork> seutje: its one of the best jokes in that serie for a while, i laughed to much when i read the blink joke :)
[02:50:30] <seutje> :P
[02:50:43] <Cork> daslicht: are you setting the value on the attribute?
[02:50:44] <daslicht> so reset just resets to the creation state
[02:50:49] <Cork> yes
[02:51:00] <Cork> the "original none use modified state"
[02:51:18] <daslicht> I use teh same form to create and update items
[02:51:36] <Cork> use==user
[02:51:44] <daslicht> so when i edit an item I load the rendered form from teh server
[02:52:03] <Cork> ok, so reset will reset it to the changes from the server
[02:52:09] <daslicht> and display it , now i like to reset the form after sending
[02:52:12] <daslicht> the updates
[02:52:20] <daslicht> exactly :)
[02:52:21] <Cork> if you want to clear the form, and not reset it it is a bit more complicated
[02:52:59] <daslicht> ok i try the fiunction i have found and posted above
[02:53:26] <daslicht> arg, not working either hehe
[02:53:47] <daslicht> what about setting all values to null?
[02:55:26] <Cork> daslicht: http://jsfiddle.net/HgbjS/1/
[02:55:43] <Cork> as long as you set it in the right way it should work
[02:55:56] <daslicht> ok
[02:56:48] <seutje> things like checkboxes and select lists need a bit of extra massaging though
[02:56:55] <Cork> daslicht: basically, then you reset a form, the browser resets the field to whats in the attribute values
[02:57:42] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/pzf4d/
[02:57:51] <daslicht> thats teh function i found on teh net
[02:57:56] <daslicht> seams to do the job
[02:58:00] <Cork> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/HgbjS/2/
[02:58:07] <daslicht> something like this should be part of jequery :)
[02:58:13] <daslicht> jquery
[02:58:53] <Cork> daslicht: as long as you construct the form correctly and update it the right way it should just work
[02:58:57] <seutje> Cork: fine, guess I don't need to finish the example myself :P
[02:59:01] <Cork> daslicht: and thats why its not included by default
[02:59:07] <daslicht> :)
[02:59:49] <Cork> and sure, lets add selectboxes when  we're at it
[03:01:25] <daslicht> :)
[03:01:51] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/HgbjS/3/
[03:03:33] <Cork> opps i run the checkbox code twice :x
[03:03:51] <daslicht> forked :)
[03:05:38] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/HgbjS/4/
[03:05:40] <Cork> there :)
[03:05:46] <Cork> i think that covers all element types :D
[03:05:54] <daslicht> i love js
[03:06:01] <daslicht> i could fiddle all day long
[03:06:25] <daslicht> i NEVER thought that I eveer will like js
[03:06:52] <Cork> s/will/would/ ?
[03:08:46] <daslicht> I never thought that I am ever going to love js ?
[03:08:50] <daslicht> is that better ?
[03:09:28] <daslicht> so i never thought in teh past , that I ever will love js in the future
[03:09:45] <Cork> still wrong tense unless i fail totally
[03:10:11] <daslicht> how would you say it correctly
[03:10:12] <Cork> "I never though that i would ever lvoe js"
[03:10:13] <daslicht> ?
[03:10:29] <daslicht> ahh
[03:10:31] <daslicht> ok i see
[03:10:43] <daslicht> thank you :)

[03:20:21] <sumi> Hiiiiiiiiiiiii
[03:20:43] <sumi> hello
[03:21:15] <Cork> ?
[03:21:22] <Cork> `ask
[03:21:22] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:22:59] <sumi> in dynamic text <anchor tag is not closed properly ,it is effecting to down static text about us
[03:23:08] <sumi> i need to fix using jquery
[03:24:16] <Cork> sumi: you have to grab the anchors and extract the content that shouldn't be inside it and move it out
[03:24:33] <sumi> <a class="apply dialogApplyBtn" lang="en_US" span="" <="" onclick="" href="/apply/" xml:lang="en_US"> </a>
[03:24:46] <sumi> this is the dynamic content
[03:24:55] <Cork> and what is it you want to do?
[03:24:56] <Hobbestigrou> hi
[03:26:06] <Hobbestigrou> to start sorry for my bad english
[03:26:08] <sumi> when i wrote code like this t disable the hyperlink
[03:26:10] <sumi> <script type="text/javascript">
[03:26:19] <sumi> $('#TrackingJobBody a').contents().unwrap();
[03:26:29] <sumi> it is working in firefox
[03:26:35] <sumi> but not working in ie
[03:26:42] <Cork> ya, you remove the a tag
[03:27:00] <Cork> sumi: but from that html what is it you want to change
[03:27:32] <sumi> just i want to disable the hyperlink coming from the dynamic text
[03:27:43] <Cork> oh
[03:27:50] <sumi> which posted by client
[03:28:09] <Hobbestigrou> i want display a spinner for all ajax jquery setup, so i tried this code https://gist.github.com/hobbestigrou/f2b959d86f2dfac45007 and https://gist.github.com/hobbestigrou/ce87ceb35015e085ebad
[03:28:18] <sumi> the text should be visible but hyperlink should not work
[03:28:47] <Hobbestigrou> and it works if i comment the ajaxsetup
[03:28:59] <Cork> sumi: try $('#TrackingJobBody a').each(function() { $(this).replaceWith($(this).html()); })
[03:29:35] <sumi> it will work in all browsers?
[03:29:51] <Hobbestigrou> so i have try to use beforesend on ajaxsetup like that https://gist.github.com/hobbestigrou/bb5870dde7f213063966
[03:30:06] <Hobbestigrou> but it does works, any person have a idea ?
[03:30:13] <Cork> sumi: yes
[03:30:40] <Cork> sumi: though it would prob try to fix this somewhere else
[03:30:49] <Cork> sumi: either if you get it through ajax, fix it before its added
[03:31:09] <Cork> sumi: or if you just want to disable the links, reset there style and disable them
[03:32:04] <seutje> there's no global way of telling jquery ui dialog to fuck off, is there?
[03:32:16] <sumi> total code disabled when i use this code $('#TrackingJobBody a').each(function() { $(this).replaceWith($(this).html()); })
[03:32:27] <sumi> the text should remain
[03:32:34] <sumi> only link should disable
[03:32:57] <Cork> sumi: that should work, but can't help without seeing the code
[03:33:30] <Cork> seutje: you mean dialog('destroy') ?
[03:33:56] <seutje> yeah, but like "any dialog that's open right now"
[03:34:43] <sumi> http://jobview.monster.com/GetJob.aspx?jobid=121119965&jtid=8048&jtver=3.1
[03:35:02] <sumi> in this see hyperlink for about us section
[03:35:06] <sumi> i need to remove
[03:35:19] <sumi> hyperlink for about us section
[03:35:59] <Hobbestigrou> person for me ?
[03:37:15] <sumi> cork did you get that what i am telling
[03:39:22] <aaronmcadam> seutje: why don't you try something along the lines of $(document).find('ui-dialog').dialog('destroy')
[03:39:37] <aaronmcadam> you might need to look up the parent to get to the proper DOM node though
[03:39:54] <aaronmcadam> and make the find a class selector
[03:40:09] <seutje> yeah, currently I'm using $(this).closest('.ui-dialog-content').dialog('destroy') but it feels a bit... clunky
[03:40:16] <Corrado> can i use "form_gestione_foto"+n+"[titolo]" in rules oj jquery validate? +n+, i have an error
[03:40:38] <seutje> (there's a reason I'm not using the button functionality)
[03:43:46] <sumi> i tried but unable to get
[03:50:52] <shwaiil> Q: Any Frontend developer interested in working on site for a small agency in London ?
[03:55:25] <harami> hello, how can i trigger a click after page loads? jQuery(".verticalslider_tabs li:first-child").trigger('click'); ?
[03:57:21] <xec_> harami: should work, yes, or just .click()
[03:57:51] <xec_> harami: mind you, it will only trigger click handlers bound with jquery
[03:57:57] <xec_> iirc
[03:58:07] <xec_> brb boot
[03:58:39] <ladislaw> i'd like to call a function depending on the size of the window... if(window.size == @media (min-width: 1200px)) do...
[03:58:43] <ladislaw> how do i do it?
[04:07:59] <harami> xec_ i want to make a div click on page load how would i do that
[04:10:36] <Hesuz> Hi! I have a question. I am using jquery ui to create a custom scrollbar. It works perfectly when I drag it. Now I want to attac a mouse scroll event to it. As when I scroll, the scrollbar moves up or down BUT can I fire/fake an event that makes the draggable scrollbar run the "drag" function
[04:19:12] <Cork> Hesuz: not sure what it is you're trying to fake
[04:19:35] <Hesuz> I want to run the drag event on the "scrollbar" that i made without actually dragging it myself.
[04:19:57] <Cork> and you're using draggable?
[04:20:00] <Hesuz> yes
[04:20:02] <Cork> ah
[04:20:15] <micthev> Hello, I have a problem: I would like that when I slide a block from the left to the top box then top it in the trash is reduced then disappear. But it does not work, it reduces but does not Dragg the trash. http://jsfiddle.net/mthevenet/DDNrh/5/
[04:20:16] <Cork> sadly i have to say, donno
[04:20:19] <Hesuz> I have done it before but can't really remmember how I did it.
[04:20:32] <Hesuz> Mkay. Thanks anyway, Cork :)
[04:24:04] <mkoks> so yet again - maybe now here is someone who is familiar with http://multidatespickr.sourceforge.net/ ? I know there's function to disable dates but there isnt something to enable just some of them.
[04:24:12] <mkoks> maybe any logical ideas?
[04:25:17] <ladislaw> what's wrong with this statement?  if( e.type == "resize" && $(window).width() > 979){
[04:27:50] <micthev> nobody ?
[04:27:51] <Cork> ladislaw: what element is it bound on?
[04:28:09] <ladislaw> document
[04:28:30] <Cork> document doesn't get a resize event
[04:28:37] <Cork> unless you fake it
[04:28:42] <Cork> only window does
[04:31:04] <sth> Hey guys, how do I make jquery allow for jsonp requests that don't use callback=?
[04:31:21] <sth> instead, we use jsfunc/?
[04:32:20] <ladislaw> Cork: changed it to windows.  works!
[04:32:45] <Cork> sth: jsfunc?
[04:32:50] <Cork> what do you mean?
[04:33:02] <Cork> you mean the variable jsfunc instead of callback?
[04:33:52] <sth> so the url with the callback is: http://api.domain.com/foo/bar/baz/jsfunc/qux
[04:33:58] <sth> and qux is the name of the jsonp callback
[04:34:09] <Cork> ah, hmm
[04:34:27] <Cork> i don't think thats supported actually
[04:34:52] <Cork> sth: whats supported is jsonp in http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:35:13] <Cork> you can hardcode the callback function name though
[04:35:26] <Cork> through jsonpCallback
[04:36:03] <mazzachre> Hmmm... trying to get my head around an enclosure... Is it fine if I add a var xxx = $('<something/>'); to the beginning of my $.ready(function() {}); and reference it in the handlers in there? Or how should I do?
[04:36:04] <sth> I've added it, however it still fails citing cross domain issues
[04:36:58] <Cork> mazzachre: its fine
[04:37:16] <drarok> Hi all, where do I report bugs with the examples in jQuery UI? The 'show all' is broken on http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox
[04:37:55] <Cork> sth: try $.ajax('http://api.domain.com/foo/bar/baz/jsfunc/qux', { crossDomain: true, jsonpCallback: 'qux', jsonp: '' })
[04:38:36] <mazzachre> Cork: OK, so $.ready(function() {var x = $('<h1>Header</h1>'); $('#somewhere').on('click', function() {$(this).after(x.clone());});}); would do as I expect? :)
[04:39:02] <Cork> yes
[04:39:12] <Cork> mazzachre: function() {} creates a scope
[04:40:02] <mazzachre> Cork: Ya, that was what I though :) But I was unsure if my understanding was correct... thx
[04:41:01] <jqp> Hi, anyone with experience on jqPlot ?
[04:41:08] <sth> Cork: nope :/
[04:41:14] <jqp> :(
[04:41:54] <Cork> ah
[04:42:03] <Cork> sth: try $.ajax('http://api.domain.com/foo/bar/baz/jsfunc/qux', { dataType: 'jsonp', crossDomain: true, jsonpCallback: 'qux', jsonp: '' })
[04:42:07] <Cork> missed that one
[04:43:17] <sth> Cork: https://gist.github.com/sthulbourn/5318664
[04:43:22] <sth> that's my $.ajax call
[04:43:33] <jqp> nobody used jqplot with jquery here ?
[04:53:40] <sth> Cork: thanks
[04:53:43] <sth> I was being a dumbas
[04:53:46] <sth> ironic.
[04:53:48] <sth> dumbass*
[05:01:01] <harami> hello, how can i auto click a div on page load?
[05:03:48] <xec_> harami: the code you posted earlier should do the trick
[05:06:52] <kakarlus> hi guys, im having a problem with parent().find(".myDiv");
[05:07:05] <kakarlus> it returns Object[]
[05:07:24] <kakarlus> but i dont have that object inside the parent
[05:14:04] <titii> kakarlus: what u want to do?
[05:17:28] <Hobbestigrou> ok, i found my problem
[05:17:31] <Hobbestigrou> thanks
[05:18:14] <Hobbestigrou> it was because i had the async option to false
[05:18:57] <aaronmcadam> I look forward to the day they remove that option
[05:19:04] <aaronmcadam> it's already meant to be deprecated
[05:19:41] <Hobbestigrou> so i left this option to false in ajax setup and my special request I made async true
[05:19:59] <aaronmcadam> you're missing the point of ajax doing that
[05:20:02] <aaronmcadam> it *will* be removed
[05:20:09] <Hobbestigrou> aaronmcadam, which option ?
[05:20:14] <aaronmcadam> async
[05:20:19] <Hobbestigrou> ah
[05:20:31] <aaronmcadam> what's the point in setting an asynchronous method to not be
[05:20:35] <aaronmcadam> defeats the purpose
[05:20:43] <aaronmcadam> it's an anti-pattern
[05:20:48] <aaronmcadam> ?ajax101
[05:20:49] <b-ot> aaronmcadam: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpgÂ and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[05:20:49] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[05:22:40] <Hobbestigrou> aaronmcadam, ok thanks
[05:23:09] <kakarlus> titii: its just that the div i want to find inside the parent was found and returned Object [] when really its not a child of the parent
[05:23:24] <kakarlus> titii: it shouldve returned null right?
[05:26:10] <titii> kakarlus: hard to say, i dont know if u have some .mydiv in the parrent really, try to give to that object some css border 10px, or debug it somehow, what it is
[05:27:31] <titii> maybe you can debug also your parent
[05:28:45] <daslicht> $('mom').debug()
[05:29:04] <xec_> ba-da-tish!
[05:29:06] <flughafen> question, if i make something draggable, can i detect it's location?  say i had 2 divs, and i dragged from one div to another, can this drag trigger some event
[05:29:11] <daslicht> :)
[05:29:58] <xec_> flughafen: seen droppable?
[05:30:21] <titii> flughafen: i guess you using some jquery ui drag and drop. Check the reference :)
[05:30:44] <aaronmcadam> he wants you to read it for him tho, why can't you? ;)
[05:31:49] <titii> hehe, ooooo thats right. But i cant cant because i go to toilet now :D
[05:32:06] <xec_> print it out! or access docs on your smartphone!
[05:32:08] <xec_> excuses...
[05:32:37] <xec_> just try not to drop it in the toilet
[05:32:46] <flughafen> that's the reasons smart phones were invented, to play games while on the toilette
[05:34:50] <mazzachre> OK this is kind of cool, but I don't know how it actually works... http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/XY6w7/ How can I use .val() on something that is a span and a select?!
[05:35:49] <Teh-Master> anyone know of a good image upload script that allows preview before hand and that works on most browsers(IE7+, FF, Chrome, etc)?
[05:37:14] <harami> pagination doesn't work with get_posts ?
[05:37:24] <Hobbestigrou> aaronmcadam, thanks again
[05:37:47] <aaronmcadam> you dropped async?
[05:39:51] <mattp__> $.when(promises).then(function() {  _.each(promises, function(p) { console.log(p.state()) });  }); // this is firing immediately, and outputting [pending, pending] in the console.log. what??
[05:40:01] <mattp__> this is what im seeing.. does it make sense?
[05:43:44] <qom2> I'm outputting some stuff with jquery.each, and for some reason in chrome the order is reversed compared to firefox and safari, why is that? http://pastebin.com/JdqEp4MC fx/safari outputs like this: 59, 56, 45, 15 and chrome: 15, 45, 56, 59.
[05:44:19] <shoky> mattp__: i think you want $.when.apply($, promises).then(...)
[05:44:50] <mattp__> shoky: interesting. why/where?
[05:44:56] <mattp__> ive missed that in the documentation
[05:45:30] <shoky> mattp__:  $.when takes separate promises as arguments, not an array
[05:45:43] <mattp__> shoky: ahhh
[05:45:56] <shoky> and that's how you apply an array as arguments in a function call
[05:46:09] <mattp__> shoky: ya, youre right. my JS is rusty. thanks
[05:52:29] <computer2000> pls help - i want to store an element eg var myelement = $('#myelement'); then remove it temporarily from the dom and then wrap it inside a new div and then place it back into dom but somewhere else with append() ... somehow i cant use .wrap() on an element saved in a variable, while its not in the dom, is this right behaviour? what can i do=
[05:53:32] <shoky> qom2: object's fields aren't sorted in any specified order, if you want ordering use an array
[05:53:48] <titii> computer2000: maybe u can hide this element .hide(); after replace just show()
[05:54:25] <computer2000> titii: thx i could do that but i prefer really removing and replacing it
[05:55:25] <shoky> computer2000:  var newdiv = $('<div>'); newdiv.append('#myelement'); newdiv.appendTo('#wherever');
[05:56:06] <computer2000> shoky: ive tried that with wrap but doesnt seem to work
[05:56:50] <qom2> shoky: how do I set it as an array rather than an object? I'm very novice.. http://pastebin.com/ismGqC1G
[05:56:59] <shoky> actually:  var newdiv = $('<div>'); $('#myelement').appendTo(newdiv); newdiv.appendTo('#wherever');
[05:57:39] <shoky> qom2: an array has []
[05:57:47] <shoky> ?learn @ qom2
[05:57:49] <bot-t> qom2, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[05:58:01] <qom2> yeah, you're right
[05:58:06] <qom2> and this is the wrong channel
[05:58:22] <qom2> as I don't know how to make it an array rather than an object, with php and json..
[06:00:26] <shoky> i didnt say you have to make it in php, i dont know what you're doing.. but fact is in javascript only arrays are ordered. if you wanna make a json array in php you probably need to use a regular array (not an associative array)
[06:08:10] <shoky> qom2: you can also make an array out of the object, just in js.. e.g:  var sortedFront = $.map( front.front, function(item) { return item } ).sort(function(a,b) { return a.id - b.id })
[06:08:50] <shoky> then $.each the sorted array
[06:10:18] <micthev> hello does somebody know why this code run OK only sometime ? http://jsbin.com/efekuj/11/edit
[06:11:49] <qom2> shoky: what do you think would be best performance wise, would probably be best with php, right?
[06:14:42] <shoky> qom2: i suppose.. don't really have much idea bout what you're doing
[06:15:26] <j3lte> Anyone that has experience with Zurb Foundation v4? Got a question
[06:16:47] <shoky> micthev: wtf is all that crap
[06:16:56] <shoky> jabo.EeddvLstninretev
[06:17:04] <interop_madness> i recently stumbled upon an interesting problem: i had a button which, onlick, would make N $.ajax() requests (N is known at that time). i issue the k+1-th request in the success handler of the k-th request. now i wanted to update a jQuery progressbar with the actual number of requests but the progressbar is not (visually) updated unless the last request is done....
[06:18:09] <interop_madness> ...so i only see 0% done, then nothing is (visually) happening for a long time, then 100% done. i know that i can't have background threads working the requests and the foreground thread updating the progress bar but still... how is this stuff done?
[06:18:21] <j3lte> I would say update the progressbar on any other successhandler?
[06:18:34] <interop_madness> j3lte, this is what i did
[06:18:54] <shoky> async:false ?
[06:18:56] <interop_madness> it seems that the actual redrawing is performed only when no javascript code is running
[06:19:46] <interop_madness> what does async even mean for javascript? i though javascript was single-threaded?
[06:19:48] <shoky> interop_madness: yes that's how it works
[06:20:15] <shoky> if you didnt do async:false thats good
[06:20:16] <interop_madness> wouldn't async:true imply busy waiting of some sort?
[06:20:25] <shoky> async:true is the default
[06:20:39] <interop_madness> yes i didn't deviate from the default
[06:20:49] <shoky> async means you set a callback to be called when something happens
[06:21:03] <interop_madness> ok, but javascript is single-threaded, right?
[06:21:05] <shoky> yes
[06:21:33] <shoky> a jsfiddle will make the issue clear
[06:21:38] <interop_madness> so in my scenario, unless the last request finishes, there is *always* code running in the one thread preventing the actual redrawing of the progressbar
[06:21:52] <shoky> why is there always code running?
[06:21:55] <shoky> that's bad
[06:23:13] <interop_madness> how could code not be running? $.ajax(... success: function() { whatever}) --> the request is sent and busy wait(?) is performed until the response had come back at which time success/error is called
[06:23:17] <interop_madness> right?
[06:23:23] <shoky> no busy wait
[06:23:28] <shoky> the A in ajax is async
[06:23:40] <shoky> the success callback will be called later
[06:23:48] <shoky> after the rendering thread has also had its run
[06:23:55] <shoky> rendering "thread"
[06:24:05] <interop_madness> there are no threads
[06:24:15] <interop_madness> and what do you mean by "thread" then?
[06:24:16] <shoky> right i mean the rendering portion of the runtime
[06:24:23] <shoky> or whatever you want to call it
[06:24:40] <shoky> forget i said thread
[06:24:44] <interop_madness> how does one code portion yield control to the other if there are no threads?
[06:25:01] <shoky> the browser has more threads to manage these things, of course
[06:25:07] <shoky> but JS runtime is just one thread
[06:25:39] <shoky> it all works by virtue of everyone doing just something small, and yielding
[06:25:47] <shoky> you dont busy-wait, you schedule a callback
[06:25:53] <shoky> just like with $.ajax
[06:26:40] <interop_madness> the browser has more threads but the JS runtime is just one thread? i fail to understand this :(
[06:26:56] <shoky> forget the other threads
[06:27:12] <interop_madness> let's say there's exactly one tab open. does the browser spawn N>1 JS runtimes in that case?
[06:27:25] <shoky> no
[06:28:07] <interop_madness> i know that i schedule a callback. that's what i'm doing. the interesting point is: whats happening in between callbacks?
[06:28:44] <interop_madness> i have a fundamental problem fathoming a solution for my problem with just one thread even with callbacks
[06:28:51] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i have a little problem : http://pastebin.com/r29MLLqN
[06:28:51] <shoky> rendering, other shit like that.. garbage collection prolly
[06:29:04] <noregret> i have .checks which is a class for several checkboxes, how can I test if at least one of the checkboxes is checked
[06:30:17] <interop_madness> ok, so in the gap between the send part f $.ajax() and the success callback the browser has time to render stuff. so if in success i increment the progress bar, the browser should repaint it during the next gap
[06:30:27] <interop_madness> so my code should work but it doesn't
[06:31:07] <shoky> interop_madness: that's why i suggested a jsfiddle
[06:31:13] <shoky> or at least pastebin
[06:32:15] <sahbeewah> Krambiorix, needs more context
[06:32:43] <sahbeewah> noregret, if($('.checks:checked').length) { ... }
[06:33:34] <noregret> nice, thanks!
[06:34:10] <Krambiorix> sahbeewah, http://pastebin.com/sv9QsZQ7
[06:38:36] <sahbeewah> Krambiorix, what does get_qtip... do? still lacks info. also if you got a typeerror you shouldn't get that console output which suggests that's a different log
[06:40:01] <Krambiorix> sahbeewah, sorry, var res = get_qtip_event_data(data);  should be     var res = callIt(data);
[06:42:05] <j3lte> yeah but the return res is in the success function
[06:44:24] <j3lte> so if I see that correctly, it's a matter of scope
[06:45:00] <darkfrog> is there a good JavaScript tree component?
[06:45:41] <triptec> hello, I have a problem with cloning a node to insert in a other node, it's some script in the node that uses document.write and it overwrites the whole page
[06:46:46] <shoky> darkfrog: jstree is ok
[06:47:33] <fulminator> hello, can someone please help me on this one: http://jsfiddle.net/nNDHE/ (it's not a workable fiddle)
[06:47:36] <sahbeewah> Krambiorix, yeah what j3lte said; returning inside the success callback doesn't return from the function... what you can do is initialize the res array before the ajax call, and return it after it..
[06:48:23] <sahbeewah> triptec, don't use document.write?
[06:48:58] <fulminator> please help on this: http://jsfiddle.net/nNDHE/1/
[06:49:01] <Krambiorix> sahbeewah,  j3lte that was the problem indeed!! Thanks a bunch guys!
[06:49:02] <fulminator> should be easy
[06:49:04] <darkfrog> shoky: it would appear that you have to build it entirely with JavaScript...I would much rather just build an HTML list and have it convert it.
[06:49:13] <Gmac_> ok I'm confused with uploading media images
[06:49:21] <Gmac_> so wordpress no longer makes a thumbnail automatically
[06:49:30] <Gmac_> even if its set to 150 by 150
[06:49:35] <Gmac_> just curious how this all wokrs
[06:49:49] <shoky> darkfrog: have you looked at the main page..?  the first plugin is HTML_DATA plugin
[06:49:56] <Gmac_> i used to just shut it off because i uploaded the perfect size
[06:50:15] <Gmac_> but now i plan on having users upload featured images so i prob need it to crop
[06:50:27] <darkfrog> shoky: sorry, you're right...I was looking at a different one. :o
[06:50:54] <NoiseEee> Gmac_: that's likely backend stuff, and try #wordpress ?
[06:51:06] <sahbeewah> fulminator, doesn't make sense to convert a div element into a string... it's unclear from the example which data you're trying to retrieve
[06:51:08] <Gmac_> LOL i thought i was in wordpress
[06:51:17] <Gmac_> grr now i have to type all over again
[06:52:03] <j3lte> Anyone that can help me with Zurb Foundation 4? I want to call the clearing plugin on a dynamically created UL, but I have no idea how
[06:54:14] <triptec> sahbeewah: yeah, I know but its that ads that uses it
[07:08:38] <Z3R0> anyone wanna help with a stupid problem ?
[07:09:06] <Z3R0> function a(value) { alert(value); }  /// then elsewhere, I try to access a('this is something') and it states a is not a function...
[07:09:11] <Z3R0> when it CLEARLY is a function...
[07:10:09] <Z3R0> I have another function that is the EXACT same setup, that works perfectly, just not this one :(
[07:12:40] <masentinel900> Good morning guys!!
[07:13:03] <Z3R0> hey masentinel900 solve my problem!
[07:13:23] <masentinel900> Yes?
[07:13:32] <Z3R0> function a(value) { alert(value); }  /// then elsewhere, I try to access a('this is something') and it states a is not a function...
[07:13:47] <Z3R0> ah I know the problem nvm!
[07:13:56] <Z3R0> damn function name matched a var name
[07:13:59] <masentinel900> Congrats!!
[07:14:07] <masentinel900> Well made!!
[07:14:34] <solancer> hey guys
[07:14:38] <Z3R0> yep all working
[07:14:40] <Z3R0> what's up solancer?
[07:14:51] <solancer> I have a question
[07:14:55] <Z3R0> figured as much ?
[07:14:59] <solancer> http://i.imgur.com/EH002tH.png
[07:15:03] <solancer> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5679839/
[07:15:23] <Z3R0> ok?
[07:15:59] <solancer> I'm trying to change the value of a hidden input field using jquery
[07:16:05] <micthev> mshoky ?
[07:16:09] <micthev> shoky:
[07:16:24] <Z3R0> $("imgval").value = imgv;
[07:16:28] <Z3R0> $("imgval").value(imgv);
[07:16:31] <Z3R0> er
[07:16:37] <Z3R0> $("imgval").val(imgv)
[07:16:57] <solancer> oh that was simple :)
[07:17:02] <solancer> I'll try that
[07:18:08] <sahbeewah> #imgval
[07:18:28] <Z3R0> good catch sahbeewah
[07:18:39] <Z3R0> $("#imgval").val(imgv);
[07:19:20] <solancer> no it din't work and no errors in the js console
[07:19:24] <Z3R0> O.o
[07:19:35] <Z3R0> time to fiddle...
[07:19:56] <Z3R0> although that won't help much, because you can't see html code being changed I don't think... lol
[07:20:50] <Z3R0> did you adjust imgval => #imgval ?
[07:23:32] <Z3R0> $("imgb").change(imageVal);
[07:23:34] <Z3R0> should be
[07:23:35] <Z3R0> $("imgb").change(imageVal());
[07:23:45] <Z3R0> imageVal = variable = 0
[07:23:49] <Z3R0> imageVal() = function
[07:24:04] <Z3R0> but...
[07:24:11] <Z3R0> u might as well include it alltogether
[07:25:06] <Z3R0> http://paste.laravel.com/mLn
[07:25:18] <Z3R0> ack

[07:26:12] <the_other_Jeff> in a selector for a link I have the following http://pastebin.com/JuGQRmRh  I read everywhere that that is the way to change the position of a fancybox, but when I click the link it still opens centered on the screen
[07:27:13] <Z3R0> hmm interesting the_other_Jeff
[07:27:30] <Z3R0> so I assume you are trying to position the box near the link ?
[07:27:41] <solancer> Z3R0, ah its works!
[07:27:46] <solancer> Z3R0, thanks a lot
[07:27:46] <Z3R0> ;) woot ;)
[07:27:48] <Z3R0> np
[07:28:04] <the_other_Jeff> Z3R0, and the css does not show up as overwritten in firebug. Yes, near the link.
[07:28:05] <solancer> Z3R0, one more question
[07:28:13] <the_other_Jeff> *overridden
[07:28:21] <Z3R0> oh wait the_other_Jeff
[07:28:37] <Z3R0> hmmm...
[07:29:19] <Z3R0> yea css ( { } ) doesn't seem to work like that
[07:29:43] <the_other_Jeff> Z3R0, i tried it with .fancy-wrapper, because I see that, and #fancy-wrapper, because the docs say everything is wrapped in that, though I don't see it
[07:29:48] <the_other_Jeff> Z3R0, oh??
[07:29:57] <solancer> Z3R0, I get the value of input file as C:\fakepath\alkife_deadmines_by_ivangomez-d4nn9s4.jpg
[07:30:22] <solancer> Z3R0, can I truncate it and extract jus the name of the file?
[07:30:30] <daslicht_> top: position.top+"px !important" as far as i know is that NOT valid css
[07:30:43] <BillCriswell> the_other_Jeff: Are you running the CSS before or after fancybox shows up?
[07:30:55] <the_other_Jeff> BillCriswell, before
[07:30:57] <daslicht_> is it
[07:30:58] <daslicht_> ?
[07:31:05] <Z3R0> not saying it's not valid... just saying according to $.css() it doesn't say you want run it with { }
[07:31:10] <the_other_Jeff> daslicht_, it is
[07:31:11] <Z3R0> can*
[07:31:17] <daslicht_> ok i see
[07:31:28] <daslicht_> yoyre constructing teh string
[07:31:30] <daslicht_> sorry
[07:31:35] <BillCriswell> the_other_Jeff: Try onComplete: function(){ /* Your code */ }
[07:31:38] <the_other_Jeff> daslicht_, this is in js... the position.top gets replaced with a value
[07:31:53] <Z3R0> just for kicks the_other_Jeff
[07:31:57] <Z3R0> one sec, going to make sample
[07:32:05] <daslicht_> yeh i overlooked it sorry
[07:32:13] <daslicht_> <- shame on me
[07:33:01] <masentinel900> Guys!!
[07:33:07] <masentinel900> Someone could help me with this?
[07:33:08] <masentinel900> http://pastebin.com/8TtEt70Y
[07:33:17] <Z3R0> nope looks like I was wrong that should wokr
[07:34:02] <BillCriswell> the_other_Jeff: If you're using two there's also a topRatio and leftRatio option.
[07:36:52] <Z3R0> lol he quit...
[07:37:05] <j_ayen_green> noaXess, I keep getting booted
[07:37:18] <j_ayen_green> haha. no   I keep getting booted
[07:37:29] <noaXess> ;)
[07:37:51] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, I tried just now using absolute values in the css, no difference
[07:38:08] <twisted`> Hi, I've Googled this for a bit but can't seem to find a solution except external libs and don't believe it's needed. I have a form with some fields. Now I can do $.serialize() and use that to POST the data. However before I send it I just want to merge an existing JSON into that too. Now the easiest would be if the form's data would be in JSON too. Any
[07:38:08] <twisted`> ideas?
[07:38:33] <BillCriswell> twisted`: serializeArray() would get you closer.
[07:39:10] <BillCriswell> It products an array like [ { name: 'email', value: 'bill@gmail.com' }, { name: 'name', value: 'bill' } ];
[07:39:15] <BillCriswell> produces*
[07:39:25] <BillCriswell> I always type that when I mean to type produce
[07:39:32] <twisted`> hmm yeah that already looks a lot closer to the JSON I have except for the extra brackets
[07:39:43] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, what were you saying about .css({ }) ?  It's not working. Do I need to do each setting with .css(x,y) ?
[07:40:12] <BillCriswell> twisted`: You can go through it and do ob[this.name] = this.value and just $.extend() that bitch.
[07:40:31] <Z3R0> nothing j_ayen_green I was wrong about that....
[07:40:33] <Z3R0> that should work fine
[07:40:56] <BillCriswell> I think the whole office took the day off an no one told me.. unless everyone is 40 minutes late.
[07:40:59] <BillCriswell> Which would be hilarious.
[07:41:03] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, so I put an alert there, and it fires, but the css does not show up in firebug
[07:41:32] <twisted`> ok so the external libs is not so odd then :"D
[07:42:41] <twisted`> ok maybe it's easier if I explain what I'm trying to achieve, hehe
[07:43:01] <Z3R0> wait
[07:43:05] <twisted`> I have a JSON string like this: var alarmSettings = {"messung-blutzucker-Montag-0":"12","messung-blutzucker-Donnerstag-0":"13","messung-blutzucker-Samstag-0":"20","messung-blutzucker-1":"15","messung-blutzucker-2":"11"};
[07:43:06] <Z3R0> j_ayen_green are there any console errors?
[07:43:17] <twisted`> I need to merge the new info from the form into that
[07:43:18] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, checking...
[07:43:24] <BillCriswell> twisted`: Work.
[07:43:31] <BillCriswell> Word.
[07:43:37] <BillCriswell> And you form is named just like that?
[07:43:40] <Z3R0> because I just tried the same code and it's failing in fiddle
[07:44:27] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/Up5hv/1/ // this should move the box (according to your code)
[07:44:40] <Z3R0> erm
[07:45:49] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, not here...the fiddle isn't working
[07:46:28] <Z3R0> yea I know
[07:47:34] <Z3R0> hmmmm...
[07:48:08] <oxsav> hey ,, ~
[07:48:37] <BillCriswell> twisted`: Making sense?
[07:48:52] <oxsav> i'm trying to look to a modal that can be minimized, maximized and closed.
[07:48:56] <Z3R0> that's weird...
[07:49:12] <oxsav> I'm using jquery 1.9.1 and jquery-ui 1.10.2
[07:49:20] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/Up5hv/3/ // I don't see anything WRONG with the code... but it's not working either lol
[07:49:32] <oxsav> do you know anything?
[07:49:58] <BillCriswell> twisted`: http://pastie.org/pastes/7328469/text here's what you'd basically do.
[07:50:12] <Z3R0> even with separated css()
[07:50:24] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, right. just tried that
[07:51:03] <twisted`> http://stackoverflow.com/a/5199982/1303677
[07:51:37] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, trying the fiddle with values
[07:51:38] <twisted`> cool thanks I'll look at that
[07:52:24] <BillCriswell> twisted`: This is doing along the same lines of what I'm doing, just more carefully haha.
[07:52:32] <BillCriswell> I just wrote it up real quick to get you a rough idea
[07:52:44] <Z3R0> nothing...
[07:53:34] <Z3R0> ooo
[07:53:35] <Z3R0> one sec
[07:54:37] <Z3R0> nope nvm...
[07:55:07] <Z3R0> ok got it ;)
[07:55:30] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/Up5hv/9/ // there
[07:56:39] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, why?
[07:56:53] <j_ayen_green> needs to be done on the click?
[07:58:53] <ladislaw> ladislaw> Given this: <div id="user-label"><span><img src="image"></img></span><span>username</span></div>
[07:58:53] <ladislaw> <ladislaw> trying to get the value "username"
[07:58:53] <ladislaw> <ladislaw> $('#user-label span span').val(); <- fails
[07:59:29] <j_ayen_green> Z3R0, thanks!!
[08:00:34] <ladislaw> anyone>
[08:00:36] <ladislaw> ?
[08:01:26] <Arieh> ladislaw I guess because that second span isnt in the first one, you probably need this http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[08:01:51] <Arieh> or somthing child related :P sorry I don't usually help here
[08:02:59] <Z3R0> no
[08:03:01] <Z3R0> it doesn't
[08:03:04] <Z3R0> I just did that to trigger it
[08:03:12] <Foobarbaz_> Morning folks. Does nayone know how to get the element that's being updated by binding to the "ajaxComplete" on $(document)?
[08:03:47] <Z3R0> foobarbar_ CODE?
[08:03:56] <Z3R0> sorry for the caps
[08:04:35] <Foobarbaz_> $(document).bind('ajaxCmplete',function(a,b,c) {..... do somehting
[08:04:44] <Foobarbaz_> ajaxComplete*
[08:04:45] <Z3R0> are you using latest ?
[08:04:56] <Foobarbaz_> yes
[08:04:59] <Z3R0> .on()
[08:05:11] <Foobarbaz_> the on / bind is not the point
[08:05:21] <Foobarbaz_> what I am trying to get is the element that's being updated
[08:05:44] <Foobarbaz_> for example $("#element").load("/abc"); <--- I want #element
[08:05:54] <Z3R0> you want #element in the ajaxComplete?
[08:06:04] <Z3R0> hmmm...
[08:06:10] <Foobarbaz_> yeh the string will be fine or the object even better
[08:06:46] <ladislaw> does not work =>   var $username =  $('#user-label span:nth-child(2)').val();
[08:07:22] <daslicht_> Foobarbaz_: maybe, just use a $ajax call than you have more freedom
[08:07:30] <Z3R0> doesn't seemto have any reference to the object that performed the call
[08:07:45] <Foobarbaz_> I need to attach it to every request so it's not really possible#
[08:07:51] <Z3R0> right
[08:08:02] <Foobarbaz_> ^ $.ajax i mean
[08:08:23] <Z3R0> you could load it all into a global container
[08:08:28] <Z3R0> that won't change names :0
[08:08:37] <ladislaw> nvm
[08:08:39] <Z3R0> that's kind of what I did
[08:08:41] <ladislaw> ignore that
[08:08:46] <twisted`> lol I'm so boned ^_^
[08:08:54] <Z3R0> everything with my ajax stuff gets pushed into $('#ajaxContent')
[08:09:26] <Foobarbaz_> I have a similar way to do things but I also send things elsewhere
[08:09:46] <Foobarbaz_> basically I need to execute a function after each complete request but I NEED context to execute it under
[08:09:53] <Z3R0> yea
[08:10:05] <Foobarbaz_> I am very surprised it's not baked in to jquerey
[08:10:07] <Foobarbaz_> -e
[08:10:26] <triptec> what would be the best way to have a index page generated from ajax json data and then a single page for viewing a post in jquery mobile?
[08:12:18] <Z3R0> you could create a psuedo function ?
[08:12:48] <Z3R0> .load('',myAjaxComplete($(this)));
[08:13:33] <twisted`> BillCriswell: yeah it works :)
[08:13:34] <Foobarbaz_> it's not always performed with "load"
[08:13:46] <Z3R0> well most everything have binded callbacks
[08:13:47] <Foobarbaz_> some are $.post some are $.get
[08:13:55] <Foobarbaz_> according to the docs "This object will be made the context of all Ajax-related callbacks. By default, the context is an object that represents the ajax settings used in the call ($.ajaxSettings merged with the settings passed to $.ajax). For example, specifying a DOM element as the context will make that the context for the complete callback of a request, like so: "
[08:13:56] <twisted`> however, I'm now for some reason stuck... the other end before just accepted a .serialize()'d object through POST
[08:14:04] <Z3R0> so you just bind your callbacks to your custom function
[08:14:05] <twisted`> but I now of course have a JSON object, lol
[08:14:08] <Foobarbaz_> but I dont see "settings.context"
[08:14:48] <Z3R0> hmmm...
[08:15:34] <Z3R0> wait...
[08:15:37] <dungwd> join #jquery-dev
[08:15:39] <Z3R0> Each time an ajaxComplete handler is executed, it is passed the event object
[08:15:50] <Z3R0> function(event, xhr, settings)
[08:15:57] <Z3R0> event should be the object reference
[08:17:50] <Z3R0> hmmm not seeing anything there that looks promising though
[08:17:59] <Foobarbaz_> but when you bind to $(document) .. the event.target = document
[08:19:24] <spobat> does it any matter if I use attr({width: 200}) or attr({width: "200"}) ?
[08:19:41] <Z3R0> I think it needs to be string
[08:19:52] <spobat> without unit?
[08:19:59] <Z3R0> with unit
[08:20:06] <spobat> okay
[08:20:36] <serpulga> hi. Anyone knows of a jQuery ajax plugin that takes multiple endpoints, and try each of them sequentially in case of error? or anything similar? What I'm trying to accomplish is querying a redundant decentralized set of servers
[08:21:23] <Foobarbaz_> do a try catch on a loop ^^
[08:23:02] <Z3R0> the alternative Foobarbaz_ is a global variable
[08:23:07] <Z3R0> that stores the current caller
[08:23:55] <Foobarbaz_> again it's not possible in my setup, it's a multi tenant web desktop with multiple windows
[08:24:14] <Foobarbaz_> there is far to much going on with callbacks and stuff to do that
[08:24:24] <Z3R0> yea I agre
[08:24:59] <masentinel900> Guys how can I set a PlainObject  var in a post function!!
[08:25:28] <Z3R0> I hate how they are differentiating
[08:25:32] <ladislaw> what's wrong? http://pastebin.com/nxv6BvSM
[08:25:33] <Z3R0> by IF and URL
[08:25:50] <serpulga> Foobarbaz_: :)

[08:26:57] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/aNFWs/
[08:27:14] <serpulga> Performing an ajax GET, will get me cross origin problems, right
[08:27:35] <Pilate> yes, assuming you dont control the other endpoint
[08:27:40] <Foobarbaz_> unless it's jsonp
[08:28:16] <serpulga> What would be the best way to check if certain server is up
[08:28:35] <anew> check if it's up ?
[08:28:44] <anew> with jquery ?
[08:28:57] <anew> couldnt u just do an ajax and if it's up success error if not
[08:29:30] <ladislaw> anyone?
[08:30:16] <serpulga> anew: yes. there is no going around the cross origin issues, is it? Without extra configuration on the server/jsonp
[08:32:28] <anew> there is a seetting in $.ajax() for cross origin
[08:32:41] <anew> so just make sure you have that set and you can do it then do normal success/error callbacks
[08:32:55] <anew> http -> https is considered cross origin
[08:33:10] <anew> i had to do it one time, and didnt do any configurataion on the server side, i had to change my jq config
[08:34:32] <serpulga> The thing is, I might also want to change the whole url. Like on ajax error, window.location = otherserver, but I would like to make sure otherserver is up before doing the change
[08:34:59] <Z3R0> I guess I would assume they would rather you do your own callbacks to specific functions unless it's something that should be done on a global scale?
[08:35:25] <dcherman> serpulga: if you just need a "ping" check, use a 1x1px image and use the load/error events on the image to determine whether or not its up.  that will work cross domain.
[08:36:35] <serpulga> dcherman: yeah, a ping check will do
[08:37:38] <serpulga> my goodness this channel is so friendly

[08:41:06] <ladislaw> Arieh: solved ..thx
[08:41:29] <ladislaw> Arieh: how would I get the value for the image?
[08:41:55] <Arieh> $(..).attr("src");
[08:45:28] <aep> hmm jquery doesn't like like being loaded into a chrome app
[08:45:33] <aep> am i doing something wrong ?
[08:45:40] <aep> Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined jquery-migrate-1.1.1.min.js:2

[08:47:51] <aep> oh god, js without jquery is the suffering
[08:48:29] <dcherman> serpulga: yea.  that's pretty much the approach i'm talking about.
[08:51:16] <aep> oh i see, works fine, stupid me.

[09:23:30] <masentinel900> Guys do you can help me with this plz!!
[09:23:43] <masentinel900> This is in php :: json_encode(array("Diego"=>19));
[09:25:29] <mads-> masentinel900, how about you describe your problem
[09:26:30] <masentinel900> I need to get the value inside the array from php for show it with jquery success function!
[09:27:46] <masentinel900> json_encode(array("Diego"=>19));
[09:27:58] <masentinel900> I need to get the Diego key on jQuery
[09:28:44] <TheSisb> if you're echo-ing that to the page that is being fetched through the ajax call
[09:29:07] <TheSisb> then in the success: function(resp) { // do this: resp.Diego
[09:29:26] <masentinel900> I'm doing that but now show me undefined
[09:29:38] <TheSisb> console.log(resp)
[09:30:30] <Kogs> so I'm doing $('form').submit(function(e) { return false; }); and it insists on submitting anyway on Chrome, but not on Firefox
[09:30:33] <Kogs> any ideas?
[09:30:57] <masentinel900> console.log(data);: Doing this don't show me nothing
[09:31:11] <TheSisb> it should in your console
[09:31:20] <TheSisb> f12 choose the console tab
[09:31:38] <masentinel900> yes, Only put a red circle right side
[09:31:51] <masentinel900> But don't show me any trouble
[09:31:56] <TheSisb> i dont know then
[09:31:58] <Changa> Hello, I have an ajax form submit on my page. It works on Chrome, FF, but on IE9 it doesnt. It gives me an error on php ( I think the problem is with the jquery code) . here is the page: http://edizarca.com/karpaz
[09:32:06] <pachet> Kogs: $('form').on('submit.foo', function ( event ) { event.preventDefault(); return false; });
[09:32:22] <Kogs> what's .foo?
[09:32:27] <Kogs> I mean, what does it represent
[09:32:43] <pachet> it's an event namespace
[09:32:50] <pachet> that way you can unbind that handler specifically
[09:32:56] <Kogs> oh I see okay
[09:33:58] <TheSisb> with large codebases or complex elements with many events, you might have two separate click events (ie: $('#a').on('click', fn)  // and later // $('#a').on('click', fn2)
[09:34:09] <Kogs> pachet: same thing :/
[09:34:21] <Changa> any idea why isnt my form isn't working on IE9? http://edizarca.com/karpaz
[09:34:22] <TheSisb> adding the .NAME to the event is like giving it a class, to unbind something specifically as pachet said
[09:35:01] <Kogs> pachet: http://jsfiddle.net/Tzy28/ is the actual code
[09:38:05] <Kogs> pachet: nm, got it ^_^ had a form inside another form
[09:38:09] <Kogs> thanks anyway

[09:41:18] <bnason> How do I select all 'a img' elements underneath my 'li's? Ive tried $('ul li').each(function() { console.log($(this).children('a img')); }):
[09:41:23] <bnason> but it doesn't return anything
[09:41:55] <ajpiano> .children("a img") is nonsensical, use .find("a img")
[09:42:23] <bnason> awesome thanks :)
[09:42:32] * bnason goes and learns the difference
[09:58:14] <Corrado> how can i get currentForm if i have onclick="foo()" ?
[10:01:29] <pachet> if you're using jquery why are you using inline event handlers
[10:04:19] <chinoto> pachet: could be useful if you want each instance of the function to have a argument (you could use an attribute on the element instead)
[10:07:57] <panzi> why doesn't $.Event(event) construct the same kind of wrapped event that I automatically get when I register an event handler via jQuery?
[10:08:15] <velts> anyone have any idea why i cant console.log my response from my ajax request?
[10:08:28] <panzi> where I render my html code it is inpractically to register the event handlers afterwards via jQuery
[10:08:30] <velts> i can log out the typeof he response and its of type string!
[10:08:44] <Corrado> i'd like take object form like take in jquery validate on submitHandler method
[10:08:58] <panzi> I just want to do: if ($.Event(event).buttons & 1) { ... }
[10:09:47] <Corrado> like object HTMLFormElement
[10:09:49] <panzi> or rather .button === 1 (because buttons is undefined for some reason?)=
[10:10:25] <panzi> velts: what browser? not every browser has console.log
[10:15:16] <Changa> Hello, I have an ajax form submit on my page. It works on Chrome, FF, but on IE9 it doesnt. It gives me an error on php ( I think the problem is with the jquery code) . here is the page: http://edizarca.com/karpaz - here is the same question on stackoverflow  = http://stackoverflow.com/q/15839246/1343285
[10:15:34] <Changa> please help :(
[10:15:58] <vladyn> hello guys - anyone to recommend a good book for jQuery ?
[10:17:30] <jonez> Changa, what have you tried (other than posting on stack overflow) to resolve this issue?
[10:18:12] <Changa> tried thinking of a reason why its not working
[10:18:18] <Changa> I'm on google searching for it too
[10:18:26] <Changa> I think its an issue with event.preventDefault();
[10:19:04] <Changa> somehow it does not work on ie, and it gives me the error
[10:19:40] <Changa> because the form is submitted not via ajax
[10:19:45] <Changa> it goes to target jonez
[10:20:15] <pachet> she took me high, then she took me home
[10:20:19] <pachet> target jonez, target jonez
[10:20:33] <StephenS> â¥
[10:21:52] <jonez> Changa, what error exactly?
[10:22:10] <Changa> I'm not gettin any errors now, it just doesnt submit using ajax
[10:22:17] <Changa> it goes to target page.
[10:22:48] <Changa> only on ie.
[10:23:10] <jonez> check to see if you are using preventDefault() correctly
[10:26:01] <Changa> jonez I added this http://pastebin.com/bZsBfPeX - but still no go
[10:27:30] <jonez> Changa, could you change your code a little on the server side to find out if IE is submitting the form twice?
[10:27:45] <jonez> you've got to narrow down the problem a little
[10:27:54] <Changa> how do I do that?
[10:28:05] <jonez> are you using a linux server?
[10:28:12] <Changa> I'm on a shared hosting
[10:28:13] <Changa> yes
[10:28:17] <jonez> so no root?
[10:28:26] <Changa> no
[10:28:40] <jonez> normally I use syslog, but without root you won't be able to do it.
[10:28:50] <jonez> can you view your access logs in basically real time?
[10:29:02] <Changa> I don't think so I will check
[10:30:38] <Changa> jonez no :(
[10:30:50] <jonez> then you are pretty well SOL
[10:31:01] <jonez> you can't even look at your access logs?
[10:31:39] <Changa> I think yes
[10:32:56] <jonez> Changa, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1000597/event-preventdefault-function-not-working-in-ie
[10:33:14] <Changa> yes I have tried this
[10:33:41] <Changa> http://pastebin.com/bZsBfPeX  this is what its using now
[10:34:27] <jonez> Changa, that is not the only thing that the link I found for you does
[10:34:39] <jonez> in fact, the answer that was voted highest says specifically what to do
[10:35:27] <BillCriswell> Changa: The error in IE is "Object doesn't support this property or method. Link 128. Char 3" or Tween.js.
[10:35:32] <BillCriswell> s/or/of
[10:35:50] <Changa> hm.
[10:35:55] <Changa> so tween js is messing up the rest?
[10:36:28] <BillCriswell> You bet.
[10:37:34] <dersand> I am trying to make a list menu. When one is clicked a unique div(if list one = div 1 and list 2 = div 2) will animate from left to right using marginLeft in the animate method. However i want to make so if you click list item 2 the current one will animate right to left and the new div will animate left to right. Confusing enough?
[10:39:04] <BillCriswell> Changa: There is no window.performance in IE. First time running into that.
[10:40:27] <BillCriswell> Changa: It looks like it tests for it, but I don't feel like sifting through the ternaries to figure out if it's mixed up.
[10:40:49] <ezakimak> can you use a css reset with jqui themes? when I load it first, it breaks stuff--i would've thought the themeroller would specify everything essential
[10:41:09] <Changa> I am replacing github tween.js with a local one, then I will see if I will keep it or not. I might just drop it.
[10:41:55] <BillCriswell> Replacing line 128 with: _startTime = time !== undefined ? time : Date.now();
[10:41:59] <BillCriswell> should do the trick
[10:42:11] <BillCriswell> I think?
[10:42:27] <BillCriswell> Hard to know without messing with it in real time haha.
[10:43:42] <jonez> greetings. I'm having trouble with a $.post() call. the anonymous function I set up with .done() is supposed to get a 'data' argument. when I try to call data.some(), I get an error about some() being undefined. any clues?
[10:45:45] <Changa> BillCriswell jonez: tween function was messing everything up on IE so the script now checks if the browser is ie, if it is, it doesnt do tween and the form works.
[10:46:03] <Changa> I will punish IE users by not giving them cool effects.
[10:46:05] <BillCriswell> What does tween do?
[10:46:12] <Changa> the counter, try in firefox
[10:46:18] <eddiemonge> its the inbetween steps of animation
[10:46:21] <BillCriswell> I'll have to later haha.
[10:46:22] <Changa> http://edizarca.com/karpaz/
[10:46:28] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: Ah, got it.
[10:46:54] <BillCriswell> So it like... slows down a timeout.
[10:47:06] <jonez> Changa, I don't see having your code gracefully degrade (instead of failing completely) as a bad thing :)
[10:48:00] <Changa> true jonez but the overall headache the IE causes the developer. shouldnt exist anymore :p
[10:48:01] <jonez> my code worked nicely when I was using $.getJSON(). I switched to .post because I need to submit some data to the php
[10:52:00] <aphid> Trying to get duration of 'opacity' css3 transition.   Is there a more straightforward way to do this than what's going on here? http://jsfiddle.net/mUdNn/4/
[10:52:48] <dougb> I'm using $('#body-container').animate({scrollLeft: '350px'}); to scroll left, which works great, but only goes to the 350px offset.  When I try '+350px' it doesn't seem to increment it, is there a way to increment the scroll by whatever the value is set everytime that function runs?
[10:52:54] <eddiemonge> aphid: you ahvent set opacity for the transistions
[10:53:27] <eddiemonge> try without the px?
[10:54:04] <dougb> eddiemonge: same results
[10:54:05] <aphid> eddiemonge: I should still be able to access the transition attributes, no?
[10:54:24] <Bulferss> hello
[10:54:26] <eddiemonge> aphid: there is no attribute set though
[10:54:33] <aphid> transition: height .5s, width .5s, opacity 3s;
[10:54:35] <Bulferss> i have problem with youtube firefox and json
[10:54:42] <Bulferss> anyone knows anything about it :)?

[10:54:49] <codepython777> I'm trying to get an interface to the file system on my webserver. Any pointers to file managers that talk REST+jquery?
[10:54:50] <eddiemonge> aphid: you havent specified what those values are to transition though
[10:55:06] <eddiemonge> Bulferss: you probably need jsonp
[10:55:11] <Bulferss> i have got only "load more" button and i cant do antyhing
[10:55:30] <Bulferss> eddiemonge no other "nonprogramming" way (like changing sth in url)?
[10:55:44] <aphid> if I add, for instance, .face:hover { opacity: 0.5 }, it doesnt' change any of the results
[10:55:50] <eddiemonge> Bulferss: do you know what jsonp is?
[10:55:56] <Bulferss> nope
[10:56:07] <Bulferss> that url was shown in http headers live
[10:56:10] <eddiemonge> aphid: does the transistion work then? also what version of jquery?
[10:56:15] <Bulferss> when i pushed "load more"
[10:56:17] <eddiemonge> ?jsonp @ Bulferss
[10:56:18] <bot-t> Bulferss, JSONP, Quickly Â« plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[10:56:26] <jmr_> yheaaaaa
[10:56:36] <aphid> the transition works, i've tried all the ones in the jfiddle pulldown
[10:56:37] <jonez> I fixed my problem. I needed a call to JSON.parse()
[10:56:43] <Bulferss> so there is no way to just force youtube to show me 500th page?
[10:56:51] <dougb> Ah I got it working, it needed to be += not +
[10:56:54] <eddiemonge> jonez: what was your problem?
[10:57:07] <eddiemonge> Bulferss: yes, with jsonp probably
[10:57:22] <jonez> eddiemonge, I was trying to call some() on an array and got basically an "undefined method" error. I needed a call to json.parse()
[10:57:34] <aphid> the transition working isn't the issue, it's accessing the transition's attributes via a jquery .css() call.  what i have in the fiddle works but it seems awfully roundabout
[10:57:42] <eddiemonge> jonez: where did you get the array?
[10:58:05] <eddiemonge> aphid: but does the transition actually transistion?
[10:58:07] <jonez> eddiemonge, it was the result of a call to $.post.
[10:58:07] <Bulferss> god damn it there is only 1 afk person at #json
[10:58:13] <Bulferss> fool's luck
[10:58:51] <eddiemonge> jonez: you shouldnt need json.parse then. if you specify json as the datatype it will do it for you?
[10:59:02] <eddiemonge> Bulferss: did you read those links?
[10:59:20] <jonez> eddiemonge, I thought that was the case too, but adding that parse() call fixed my issue
[10:59:46] <jonez> eddiemonge, when I was using .getJSON(), it was automagically parsed into objects for me
[10:59:47] <eddiemonge> jonez: code?
[10:59:53] <Bulferss> eddiemonge i am not a programmer
[10:59:53] <aphid> eddiemonge: yeah, i'll update the fiddle - sec
[10:59:55] <jonez> eddiemonge, lemme finish cleaning it up
[11:00:05] <Bulferss> it is like reading arabic or cyrylic
[11:00:08] <eddiemonge> Bulferss: maybe hire a developer then?
[11:00:09] <Bulferss> for me
[11:00:33] <Bulferss> eddiemonge i would rather hire curl but it will be entire night of codeing and php.neting
[11:01:03] <aphid> http://jsfiddle.net/mUdNn/5/
[11:01:09] <eddiemonge> no idea what you just said
[11:02:00] <Bulferss> eddiemonge that with php and built in curl library i can just send to youtube desired get request
[11:02:08] <Bulferss> and curl will get result for me
[11:05:16] <eddiemonge> Bulferss: ok then do that
[11:05:35] <Bulferss> i am trying my luck with wget
[11:05:39] <Bulferss> wget and bash
[11:07:11] <eddiemonge> aphid: http://jsfiddle.net/mUdNn/6/ but it only shows the initial not the finished
[11:08:48] <aphid> eddiemonge: I'm not trying to get the opacity itself; I'm trying to get the transition-duration for opacity
[11:09:15] <eddiemonge> "Opacity transition duration is: 3s" isnt that what you want?
[11:09:34] <aphid> yeah, but was hoping there was something more straighforward than that
[11:09:51] <aphid> in terms of .css() selectors
[11:11:49] <eddiemonge> aphid: not really since you are defining multiples of it
[11:13:13] <Deas> how'd i htaccess redirect from "whatever.com" to "whatever.com/foo/" ?
[11:13:44] <eddiemonge> why would you want to?
[11:15:19] <eddiemonge> ?lmgtfy htaccess redirect to subdirectory @ Deas
[11:15:20] <bot-t> Deas, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=htaccess+redirect+to+subdirectory
[11:15:57] <_August_> can someone take a look at this real quick and tell me why my url continues to print out the same instead of replacing the word i am telling it to replace? http://jsbin.com/odokoj/3/edit
[11:19:54] <Gazpacho> it probably doesn't help that the string you're trying to replace isn't in the URL
[11:20:03] <Bulferss> eddiemonge i have installed firebug
[11:20:13] <Bulferss> and it gives me the option to modify live that button
[11:20:16] <Bulferss> but thanks for help
[11:20:39] <Gazpacho> also, String.replace returns the modified string, it doesn't change the string in place
[11:22:04] <Gazpacho> once those two things are fixed, it works
[11:22:11] <Gazpacho> are you even listening?
[11:22:16] <eddiemonge> _August_: http://jsbin.com/odokoj/6/edit
[11:22:19] <akkufomk> Gazpacho: I'm listening.
[11:23:00] <eddiemonge> _August_: unless you really need to do a regex search, dont. and thats not how you do a regex replace anyway
[11:26:10] <_August_> eddiemonge: thanks
[11:42:43] <wachpwnski> anyone have a good way to take json data and list the key values recursively?
[11:43:36] <eddiemonge> wachpwnski: for loop?
[11:44:21] <wachpwnski> eddiemonge, you have an example of a function that does that with a key value parameter?
[11:44:31] <eddiemonge> for in
[11:47:11] <foenix> hey all, I'm trying to change the callback in a url, but I don't know how to execute it with jQuery.ajax: https://gist.github.com/octaflop/5321567
[11:47:36] <foenix> eg: https://api.github.com/users/octaflop/repos?sort=pushed&callback=? returns nil
[11:47:43] <foenix> but, https://api.github.com/users/octaflop/repos?sort=pushed&callback=something worksâ¦
[11:48:27] <foenix> I'm a bit of a JSONP newb
[11:52:27] <eddiemonge> run it in the a browser and look at the console to see the call its making with the actual parameters
[11:56:23] <foenix> eddiemonge, run the github.js or the requested url?
[11:56:37] <eddiemonge> foenix: your script
[11:56:58] <foenix> eddiemonge, ok. Mind you, this is the octopress github.js script for their aside.
[11:57:23] <eddiemonge> doesnt matter. i just want you to run the ajax request part
[12:03:57] <innociv> What do I need to do in order to convert a string to a word that is safe as a class or id name?
[12:04:06] <innociv> stripping spaces, making sure it starts with a letter, what have you
[12:04:52] <innociv> Mh I think I found something
[12:06:40] <foenix> eddiemonge, I'm quite confused: http://jsfiddle.net/foenix/Ne2L3/4/
[12:07:20] <shoky> foenix your code was fine. and you don't need the callback=? if you have dataType:'jsonp'
[12:07:35] <shoky> foenix: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/SgsAk/
[12:08:26] <foenix> shoky: thanks, let me try to grok this. I'm still wrapping my head around the way this is written
[12:09:08] <shoky> foenix: jquery will add callback=jqueryRandom34839433  to the url for you and use that as the jsonp callback
[12:09:15] <eddiemonge> foenix: http://jsfiddle.net/Ne2L3/5/
[12:09:54] <foenix> shoky, eddiemonge Thank you very much. so JQuery will automagically execute the callback function it asigns, right?
[12:10:34] <shoky> yap
[12:19:02] <foenix> ok, the query is now well-formed, but isn't displaying: https://gist.github.com/octaflop/5321567
[12:19:51] <foenix> I think I've got it, sec
[12:20:15] <webstormer> I make too many typos.. what IDE can catch them for me in javacsript
[12:23:34] <eddiemonge> webstormer: not many. just stop making typos and lint your code
[12:30:03] <Dreamer3> can i not do $(document).trigger "ready" ?
[12:32:56] <clov3r> foenix: a little OT, but is your escapeHtml function right? not sure about $('<div/>'). surely $('div') ?
[12:33:34] <eddiemonge> Dreamer3: no. why would you?
[12:34:13] <Dreamer3> i'm capturing clicks and loading pages via AJAX
[12:34:15] <foenix> clov3r, no idea. I'll change it, but again, this is code from octopress: https://github.com/imathis/octopress/blob/master/.themes/classic/source/javascripts/github.js
[12:34:29] <Dreamer3> eddiemonge: but hooks don't get setup for the new content
[12:34:46] <eddiemonge> Dreamer3: what hooks?
[12:34:48] <Dreamer3> what i really need to do is run all the document/ready hooks again
[12:35:02] <Dreamer3> any $(document).ready hooks
[12:35:07] <Dreamer3> since they already ran
[12:35:11] <clov3r> enclose your hooks in a function and call it again
[12:35:15] <Dreamer3> but i want to run them again
[12:35:33] <anew> quick way to test if jq is loaded? is it $(jQuery);
[12:35:33] <anew> ?
[12:35:33] <Dreamer3> clov3r: there are lots of different modules with hooks
[12:35:42] <Dreamer3> if i have to edit them all i'm going to build a boot system
[12:35:48] <Dreamer3> Boot.register -> function etc
[12:36:03] <VernonK> anew jQuery
[12:36:06] <Dreamer3> the document ready calls Boot.all and i can have Boot.reboot, etc
[12:36:57] <clov3r> dreamer3: makes sense to me
[12:36:59] <VernonK> anew typeof jQuery should return 'function'
[12:37:00] <anew> just
[12:37:00] <anew> jQuery;
[12:37:00] <anew> ?
[12:37:05] <Dreamer3> eddiemonge: is the list of function stored somewhere in query where i could get at it easily?
[12:37:31] <VernonK> anew if(typeof jQuery === 'function') { â¦ }  || if(jQuery) { â¦ }
[12:37:39] <anew> can i
[12:37:42] <anew> console.log($);
[12:37:42] <anew> ?
[12:37:44] <VernonK> sure thing
[12:38:02] <anew> console.log($);
[12:38:06] <anew> oops
[12:38:11] <anew> function (e,t){return new b.fn.init(e,t,r)}
[12:38:14] <anew> is that jquery lol
[12:38:28] <eddiemonge> Dreamer3: why dont you use named functions? like $(document).ready(functionname);
[12:38:36] <VernonK> Yep. that's it.
[12:38:39] <eddiemonge> then you can call functionname after you load in the new content
[12:38:44] <anew> cool
[12:38:50] <anew> so jquery only takes two arguments? wtf
[12:39:18] <dcherman> the jquery constructor takes two arguments, yes
[12:39:29] <Dreamer3> eddiemonge: there is already tons of code written that i don't want to change
[12:39:32] <anew> that's cray
[12:39:46] <Dreamer3> eddiemonge: all the handlers are already shoved into "Ready"
[12:39:50] <eddiemonge> Dreamer3: you are going to have to change it somehow and thats the easiest way
[12:40:00] <Dreamer3> it's a shame that fire ready just does't work
[12:40:02] <Dreamer3> though i can understand why
[12:40:03] <VernonK> Everything else are pretty much methods.
[12:40:15] <VernonK> Lots of functional programming in jQuery
[12:40:35] <shoky> not enough
[12:40:58] <anew> sweet thanks vernonk
[12:41:10] <VernonK> np
[12:42:59] <dcherman> Dreamer3: it probably wouldn't be too hard to make it possible to re-fireable, but that's a serious footgun.  would not recommend it.
[12:43:06] <Dreamer3> hahaha
[12:43:16] <Dreamer3> i'm skimming the jquery source now
[12:44:53] <zoned> how do i get the cursor to stay even while dragging? it resets to default http://jsfiddle.net/AHnh8/
[12:45:58] <foenix> shoky, eddiemonge ok, so it's just a matter of getting the innerHTML to change now, not sure why it's not working so I'm going to have lunch to clear my head.  Thanks again for the help. Lemme know if the obvious problem is obvious
[12:46:21] <foenix> https://github.com/imathis/octopress/blob/master/.themes/classic/source/javascripts/github.js
[12:48:06] <Dreamer3> dhruvasagar: they are pushed onto a list inside query but it's cleared after they are executed
[12:48:53] <anew> anyone using require.js /
[12:48:54] <anew> ?
[12:49:48] <snover> anew: no, nobody ever has used that ever
[12:51:14] <anew> snover i dont understand because sometimes i do require.config({paths:{'backbone.paginator': 'libs/backbone.paginator'})
[12:51:24] <anew> but then later when i just want to write backbone.paginator
[12:51:25] <anew> it doesnt work
[12:51:32] <anew> i am always having to rewrite the entire filepath
[12:51:40] <snover> thatâs because youâre doing it wrong
[12:51:45] <anew> i thought the purpose of paths was so u can rename the path to what u want ?
[12:51:52] <anew> well obv i'm doing it wrong lol what am i doing wrong?
[12:52:34] <snover> why are you doing that anyway
[12:52:35] <clov3r> snover: yeah i lold at that one too
[12:52:44] <anew> why am i doing what
[12:52:45] <clov3r> anew: no exp with require.js here
[12:53:04] <clov3r> just cutting sarcasm
[12:53:13] <anew> ?
[12:53:37] <snover> anew: why are you trying to map paths
[12:54:32] <anew> what... so i can reference a script without referencing the entire URL
[12:55:45] <anew> ?
[12:55:56] <masentinel900> Guys!!, Someone has worked with the datatables plugin for JQuery?
[12:58:35] <anew> anyone have any idea on that
[12:59:43] <clov3r> anew: once you load your backbone.js with require, it should be available? no need to map the paths...
[13:00:13] <snover> anew: so uhâ¦donât put it in libs
[13:01:20] <anew> yeah no i'm talking about other plugins that i have to shim also
[13:01:30] <anew> snover - ur 'help' is worthless
[13:01:46] <anew> clov3r backbone loads fine with path
[13:01:55] <anew> but other plugins dont, so other jq plugins i cant rename
[13:02:47] <clov3r> anew: code example?
[13:03:44] <anew> yeah sure one second
[13:05:09] <serpulga> What's the best event to handle an append to a <ul> ?
[13:05:16] <Assimilater> is there a way to click an <a> so a select file dialog will show? (my attempt failed: http://jsfiddle.net/hpvHF/)
[13:06:39] <anew> clov3r look at line 12, 31 and 41 http://pastebin.com/9kE0CLft
[13:06:52] <anew> line 12 i have to comment out
[13:07:03] <anew> but i would like to just have it named 'boot' and reuse only 'boot on 31 and 41
[13:07:19] <cpierce> http://jsfiddle.net/hpvHF/1/
[13:07:23] <cpierce> Assimilater: http://jsfiddle.net/hpvHF/1/
[13:08:02] <cpierce> Assimilater: you could also use .fadeIn('slow'); which would look nicer
[13:08:26] <shoky> Assimilater: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/hpvHF/2/  but it might not be fully cross-browser
[13:09:04] <Assimilater> cpierce: the point is I don't want the textbox and I want to handle on a nice ui button :P
[13:09:23] <Assimilater> shoky: what kind of restrictions? Any of significance (ie I don't care about ie 8)
[13:09:55] <eddiemonge> serpulga: what do you mean?
[13:10:14] <Assimilater> incredible, my approach was so near working, odd it didn't
[13:10:34] <shoky> Assimilater: i don't remember, some browsers might not allow it for security reasons
[13:10:53] <anew> shoky u use require ?
[13:11:24] <cpierce> Assimilater: oh i see you want it open the file browser for you. .. yeah i'm with shoky, i'd say that probably isn't 100% compatable
[13:11:25] <serpulga> eddiemonge: I will be appending <li>s to a <ul>. I wonder if there is an event I can 'define' to handle those. like $('ul').change(function() {...});
[13:11:42] <cpierce> Assimilater: do like gmail and make it where you can drag a file to the box
[13:12:01] <shoky> anew: used it, but not much
[13:12:11] <anew> k
[13:12:26] <Assimilater> it appears to work in chrome firefox and ie10
[13:13:18] <Assimilater> cpierce: that format doesn't make sense with my site's gui as it's only for updating thumbnail pictures displayed in infowindows of google maps markers
[13:13:19] <cpierce> Assimilater: i'm wondering if you can do that can you put that in a hidden container and then never show the actual file upload just a text link to do it
[13:13:36] <eddiemonge> serpulga: just call your function when you append
[13:13:49] <shoky> Assimilater: welp maybe it's just opera
[13:13:59] <serpulga> eddiemonge: ok :(
[13:14:04] <Assimilater> shoky: it doesn't work in opera eh?
[13:14:33] <shoky> mayhaps
[13:14:45] <Assimilater> i haven't downloaded it on my work comp yet
[13:16:18] <Assimilater> shoky: works for me in opera
[13:16:48] <Assimilater> anyways, now the real challenge, execute jquery code when a file has been selected
[13:16:54] <Assimilater> possible? maybe?
[13:17:03] <Assimilater> (i'd like this to be an ajax upload)
[13:17:18] <cpierce> yeah
[13:17:21] <cpierce> you can do that for sure
[13:17:30] <cpierce> i think you can do change()
[13:17:38] <cpierce> and submit the form when the file changes
[13:17:46] <Assimilater> cpierce: ah that might do it
[13:18:31] <TheSisb> k
[13:18:51] <TheSisb> wrong chan lol

[15:12:28] <sunbeam> any idea how come?
[15:12:37] <Gazpacho> "it"
[15:12:57] <jtal> how are you getting the value
[15:13:15] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: is it your browser filling it with saved data? try opening it in incognito mode
[15:13:22] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: or do you have placeholder on it?
[15:13:51] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: neither
[15:14:12] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: even when i check with firebug the value is empty
[15:14:43] <jtal> sunbeam: how are you seeing the value filled in?
[15:16:49] <sunbeam> with firebug
[15:16:52] <sunbeam> jtal: oh
[15:16:54] <sunbeam> in the browser
[15:16:55] <sunbeam> in firefox
[15:17:08] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: code or link
[15:18:17] <sunbeam> uts local
[15:18:18] <sunbeam> its local
[15:19:02] <jtal> sunbeam: in firebug by typing jquery into console or by inspecting the dom element?
[15:19:24] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: screen shot then or jsfiddle it
[15:21:46] <sunbeam> jtal: inspecting the element
[15:21:55] <sunbeam> the second password field is btw not autofilled
[15:22:02] <sunbeam> and i tested several names, ids, classes etc  - thats not it
[15:22:07] <sunbeam> its just the first type="password" field
[15:22:41] <eddiemonge> you arent giving us much to work with here
[15:24:55] <jtal> yeah I'm not sure what the question is; I think sunbeam is saying there is '******' even though it says value='' in firebug
[15:25:10] <jtal> but thats normal so that cant be the question
[15:27:53] <sunbeam> jtal: exactly
[15:28:01] <sunbeam> jtal: its normal
[15:28:04] <sunbeam>  want the field to be empty
[15:28:13] <sunbeam> when user loads page
[15:29:16] <sunbeam> strange i put the field now as last field of the form
[15:29:22] <sunbeam> and now it doesnt occur anymore

[15:39:28] <spobat> (see the html/js source)
[15:48:04] <acidjazz> spobat: because you drink too much
[15:48:45] <spobat> wut?
[15:48:55] <spobat> no, because status is a global variable .
[15:50:08] <yogurt_truck> it doesn't result in bar being undefined
[15:50:17] <eddiemonge> it did
[15:50:23] <eddiemonge> change it back to the original
[15:50:44] <yogurt_truck> ??
[15:50:49] <yogurt_truck> ah. he updated the file?
[15:51:03] <eddiemonge> spobat: why are you mixing bracket and dot notation?
[15:51:03] <yogurt_truck> stupid dropbox links.
[15:51:03] <spobat> yes
[15:51:06] <spobat> i updated it
[15:51:16] <spobat> eddiemonge, because the string is actually dynamic

[19:27:50] <bsegovia> Hi everyone. I feel like I'm really close with my script. I've been trying to make a really smart phone number input field that will detect the country code (first two digits) on keyup and apply a mask based on the entry. I've got it working except it keeps overwriting the entire input field instead of allowing the input to continue. Can anyone take a peek? http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/S4CwC/3/
[20:00:57] <bsegovia> anyone around?
[20:03:36] <garbagegod> Okay so
[20:03:43] <garbagegod> jQuery mobile is really really good
[20:04:08] <garbagegod> I was shocked at its good-ness.
[20:04:22] <bsegovia> lol
[20:04:32] <bsegovia> i haven't played with it yet
[20:05:39] <garbagegod> I've spent hours trying to make apps with Sencha
[20:06:02] <garbagegod> And I am genuinely displeased I did not just try this first
[20:07:24] <bsegovia> nice
[20:42:44] <bsegovia> I've tried changing this from .keypress to .blur and it *kind of* works better. But I'm trying to have this field update live. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/S4CwC/
[20:42:50] <bsegovia> I'm just scratching my head
[20:47:53] <eddiemonge> keydown or keyup
[20:48:31] <bsegovia> @eddiemonge : I tried keyup and key press. Haven't tried keydown yet though.
[20:48:58] <bsegovia> hmm. same result. Just keeps overwriting everything I type
[20:49:19] <bsegovia> @eddiemonge: maybe it's because I've got the mask logic inside the keydown() function?
[20:54:45] <eddiemonge> i dont know how that mask plugin works
[20:58:08] <bsegovia> I hear ya. The first input box "Mask Test" shows it in action
[20:58:59] <bsegovia> i think what I need to do is somehow capture the first two digits the user types in, then store that in a variable that is used in an if statement. The tough part is getting it to happen live.
[20:59:53] <bsegovia> I'm ashamed how nooby i am at JS. Taking the courses over at code academy. =/
[21:09:03] <bsegovia> @edditmonge: ooh, i think I'm on to something. I declared my local variables first making them globally available. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/ShSF9/1/ The script is defaulting to the "else" condition and not triggering properly when I type "52" yet.. getting there
[21:10:02] <bsegovia> maybe I should wait to run the function until at least two chars are entered?
[21:10:05] <eddiemonge> declaring var in both places makes the inputs local to that scope. the first set are global, the second set sepcific to that event handler
[21:10:29] <eddiemonge> what are you trying to do?
[21:11:57] <bsegovia> @eddiemonge: I'm trying to make a really smart phone number input field that will auto format the number based on a country's formatting. e.g. USA = +1 123 123 1234 vs France = +33 1 22 33 44 55
[21:12:29] <bsegovia> id like it to trigger based on the first two digits (country code) a user enters
[21:13:54] <bsegovia> @eddiemonge : here's the mask() input plugin i'm using. pretty cool. http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[21:17:55] <bsegovia> is there a way to trigger keyup after 2 characters?
[21:18:12] <eddiemonge> thats not the issue. the issue is the plugin itself
[21:18:25] <bsegovia> oh?
[21:19:40] <nights> bsegovia: use a counter on keyup, like if($keystrokes++<1) return
[21:19:47] <nights> maybe i misunderstand
[21:20:48] <nights> is there a way to split html containing only divs directly under it into an array?
[21:22:37] <Andrew_R> nights: split in what way?
[21:22:38] <nights> var wordArray=text.split('</div>');
[21:22:40] <wachpwnski> in general what does this do: $('#id').children('.class').eq(0)
[21:22:41] <nights> this worked well
[21:23:04] <nights> eq() =>
[21:23:05] <nights> Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the .eq() method constructs a new jQuery object from one element within that set. The supplied index identifies the position of this element in the set.
[21:23:18] <wachpwnski> does taht select the first element that has the class of class from within the element with the id id?
[21:23:41] <Andrew_R> wachpwnski: yes that is correct
[21:23:49] <wachpwnski> excellent thanks
[21:24:02] <nights> you can use this also
[21:24:02] <nights> $('#id').children('.class').eq(0)
[21:24:06] <nights> err
[21:24:06] <nights> http://tux.theopalgroup.com/cgi-bin/css3explainer/selectoracle.py
[21:24:10] <nights> but thats just for selectors
[21:24:13] <Andrew_R> could be written as $('#id .class').eq(0)
[21:24:31] <Andrew_R> or even better
[21:24:31] <nights> probably a lot faster too
[21:24:37] <Andrew_R> $('#id .class:first')
[21:25:07] <nights> Selects any element with a class attribute that contains the word class and which has pseudo-class first that is a descendant of any element with an id attribute that equals id.
[21:25:08] <nights> :)
[21:26:07] <Andrew_R> cool site
[21:26:29] <khmer> $('#id').children('.class') is different from $('#id .class')
[21:27:19] <Andrew_R> khmer: yes you are right, children() only goes one level
[21:27:29] <Andrew_R> $('#id > .class:first') should be the same
[21:28:34] <khmer> correct
[22:28:06] <raj> can i make .on('mouseover') z-index aware?
[22:31:38] <eddiemonge> what do you mean?
[22:32:05] <eddiemonge> you bind the handler to an element
[22:33:13] <raj> oh, it's already z-index aware?
[22:35:46] <eddiemonge> no i mean it doesnt need to be
[22:36:15] <raj> it does
[22:36:21] <raj> or I would like it to be
[22:37:13] <eddiemonge> why?
[22:41:47] <Hilton> I just tried out jquery.fastLiveFilter - works quite well and is almost exactly what I want. But I have another requirement, not sure how I can make it work, or if there is another plugin that will work better. My rows of data have 5 columns; I only want the filter to recognize text from 3 of them. Any way I can do this?
[22:51:53] <eddiemonge> Hilton: whats the point of fastLiveFilter?
[23:16:32] <wachpwnski> Is there a way I can add functionality to a jquery object?
[23:16:54] <Andrew_R> you can add functionality to jQuery itself
[23:18:04] <wachpwnski> i want to select a div as a module
[23:18:10] <wachpwnski> and extend it's functionality
[23:18:30] <Andrew_R> extend it in what way?
[23:19:01] <wachpwnski> like var mod = extend ($('#mod'));  so I could do something like mod.render()
[23:19:32] <wachpwnski> does that make sense?
[23:21:47] <Andrew_R> $('#mod') returns a jquery object, so if you want to add a render method like that, it would be available on all jquery objects
[23:23:15] <Andrew_R> you could do something like $.render = function (selector){ var mod = $(selector); // do what you want with mod } ;
[23:23:26] <Andrew_R> and call it with $.render('#mod')
[23:25:51] <Andrew_R> the other way would be like $.fn.render = function(){ var mod = $(this); // do what you want with mod };
[23:25:59] <Andrew_R> and you would call that with $('#mod').render()
[23:26:27] <Andrew_R> one of these two ways is basically how most plugins are written
[23:28:19] <wachpwnski> Yes, makes sense
[23:28:29] <wachpwnski> I was trying to scope it out where it wouldn't be jquery wide
[23:42:18] <Hilton> Andrew_R: Using a live filter plugin, where the key line appears to be: li = looped element; if ((li.textContent || li.innerText || "").toLowerCase().indexOf(filter) >= 0) ... how can I modify this to, say, only include the text of child elements with the class "searchable"?
[23:45:53] <poacheR> greetinks :)
[23:46:39] <poacheR> Can someone help me with this?  $('#announcements').fadeOut(500).html(newmessage).fadeIn(500);
[23:46:57] <poacheR> My intention is to fade the old message out, change it behind the scences, then fade the new element in
[23:47:25] <shoky> poacheR: $('#announcements').fadeOut(500, function() { $(this).html(newmessage).fadeIn(500); })
[23:47:31] <poacheR> problem is, the message change occurs first, and in fact even before the first fadeOut finishes ... then reappears with a fadeIn effect
[23:47:35] <Hilton> shoky beat me to it
[23:47:40] <poacheR> (looks like 'ta-daaa')
[23:48:10] <Hilton> poacheR: func.func.func.func will execute one after another with no respect for what the others are doing. fadeOut()'s second parameter is a function to run when complete, as shoky demonstrated.
[23:48:15] <poacheR> let me try ... but I don't think the 'wait to finish' bit is the problem
[23:48:41] <poacheR> yes ... but I think my problem is that html(newmessage) updates the contents VISIBLY
[23:48:43] <shoky> .html() doesn't wait for animations, that was the problem
[23:48:51] <poacheR> rather than invisibly, which I then get to fade in nicely
[23:48:55] <shoky> if you wait till the fade out it'll be invisible..
[23:49:05] <poacheR> but maybe I'm wrong, let me try with the callback, thanks :)
[23:49:06] <Hilton> Your code is $().fadeout.change.fadein() - those three items are trying to run SIMULTANEOUSLY.
[23:49:21] <shoky> Hilton: only the first two
[23:49:26] <poacheR> ok, I got that
[23:49:26] <shoky> fadeIn  is queued after the fadeOut
[23:49:46] <poacheR> let see ...
[23:50:14] <Hilton> poacheR: Think of it this way. Fadeout isn't a function that runs until the animation fades out - it simply creates a setting that runs an animation. fadeout runs, tells something else to start animating, then exits and goes on to .html() right away.
[23:50:52] <poacheR> hm ... it worked. Thanks :)
[23:51:09] <poacheR> I thought it was a case of .html() defaulting back to visible ... but it was just the timing all along :o
[23:51:52] <poacheR> thanks for the help :)
