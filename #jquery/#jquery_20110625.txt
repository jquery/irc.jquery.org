[00:00:36] <GlobeCrew>  jQuery.browser.msie  <--- what is this for?
[00:00:55] <djQuery> GlobeCrew: to tell what browser they are using.
[00:01:16] <djQuery> kinda crap way to tell feature support though
[00:01:33] <GlobeCrew> well then is this redundant...		if (jQuery.browser.msie) {
[00:01:34] <GlobeCrew>  jQuery(activeTab).show();}
[00:01:34] <GlobeCrew>  else {
[00:01:34] <GlobeCrew>  jQuery(activeTab).show();
[00:01:34] <GlobeCrew> 	}
[00:01:56] <GlobeCrew> found this code on the net :)
[00:02:19] <djQuery> yeah dont know who would write that
[00:02:40] <imsky> lol
[00:02:45] <GlobeCrew> djQuery: agree. either way its shows activeTab
[00:02:54] <imsky> need to take some programming classes there
[00:07:40] <Prometheus> bottom line is, if it's ie6, kill it
[00:07:52] <Prometheus> or even ie7 possibly
[00:08:16] <GlobeCrew> kill it? how to kill?
[00:08:23] <Prometheus> by not supporting it
[00:08:37] <GlobeCrew> then you might get killed :)
[00:08:49] <djQuery> GlobeCrew: there is a lotta code out there you can use to cause ie to crash
[00:08:50] <Prometheus> uhmm.. no
[00:08:58] <djQuery> that wont affect other browsers
[00:09:32] <Prometheus> GlobeCrew: let's start with http://www.theie6countdown.com/
[00:09:51] <GlobeCrew> djQuery: but that code made no sense
[00:11:10] <Axcy> Anyone got a link to a page which can help me make a nice little "You don't have Javascript enabled" ? My form relies quite a bit on Jquery..
[00:12:02] <dr0id> Axcy: write that in a div and hide/remove with JS
[00:12:19] <dr0id> $('div').hide(); or $('div').remove();
[00:12:35] <imsky> look who it is
[00:14:17] <Axcy> dr0id: If Js is disabled I wont be able to show it with JS will I :p
[00:14:24] <GlobeCrew> $('div').hide(); or $('div').remove() <-- how about you detect if JS is enabled before you hide/remove
[00:15:05] <GlobeCrew> Axcy: good point :)

[00:47:32] <Umren>  /j #math
[00:47:39] <drupalvan> djQuery, There is a link in pastebin:
[00:47:45] <Umren> damn xD
[00:47:55] <drupalvan> djQuery: http://staging.zavieh.org/poetry?form=parags&book=4&volume=1
[00:48:02] <djQuery> drupalvan: realy want me to work for it huh
[00:48:25] <drupalvan> djQuery, sorry :-)
[00:49:12] <djQuery> how many frigin stylesheets u got loaded
[00:49:34] <imsky> over...
[00:49:35] <imsky> 9...
[00:49:37] <imsky> thousand
[00:50:08] <drupalvan> djQuery, just click on "Toggle English" and english content won't go away. The problem is that, if I change div class="parag-en content-en">to div class="content-en"> it works. I don't know why
[00:51:14] <GlobeCrew> http://jsfiddle.net/LnfF2/ <-- any ideas why these tabs dont work?
[00:52:24] <drupalvan> djQuery, every Drupal module uses its own css file. That's the reason for having so many css files.
[00:53:10] <ankush> heyy all.. can anyone look into this link.. i am having trouble chaing the events.. http://pastebin.com/dRnZWVZn
[00:53:54] <djQuery> drupalvan: why not make it easies <button id="en" class="lang-toggle">Toggle English</button>  $('.lang-toggle').click(function(e){   var lang=this.id; $('div.lang-' + id).toggle(); });
[00:54:19] <GlobeCrew> djQuery: can you solve this puzzle for me. tried for hours. http://jsfiddle.net/LnfF2/
[00:55:19] <Kambfhase> ankush: doing $("div") you search for all divs, indstead of creating a new one
[00:55:32] <djQuery> GlobeCrew: whats so puzzling? why not use allready built tabs see ?ui.tabs
[00:55:33] <bot-t> GlobeCrew, Tabs are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space. http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[00:56:05] <ankush> Kambfhase, alright.. apart from this, is evrthing done correctly?
[00:56:24] <drupalvan> djQuery,  you mean this code is not right:   $('li.toggle-en button').click(function() {
[00:56:25] <drupalvan>     $('.content-en').toggle();
[00:56:27] <drupalvan>   });
[00:56:50] <Kambfhase> ankush: you call .attr on name instead of on the div
[00:56:53] <GlobeCrew> djQuery: for learning purposes it would be cool to fix this but i can't. http://jsfiddle.net/LnfF2/
[00:57:15] <djQuery> drupalvan: it is wrong in the sense that you make extra .click for each button. where as my example is 1 click that works for all buttons
[00:58:01] <ankush> Kambfhase, no . i need to add the attribs in the newly created div element..
[00:58:06] <djQuery> GlobeCrew: whats with spelling out jquery all the time instead of usin $
[00:58:23] <GlobeCrew> djQuery: its a wordpress thing.
[00:58:37] <Kambfhase> ankush: yeah, thats what i thought, but you doo it wrong atm
[00:59:01] <djQuery> (function($){   in here $=jquery   })(jQuery);
[00:59:20] <djQuery> GlobeCrew: ^^^^^^ without blowin anything else up
[00:59:51] <drupalvan> djQuery, There is just one button which toggle all English contents. It's not the other way around.
[01:00:41] <djQuery> drupalvan: I only gave the example of the markup for 1 button the click however if all the buttons were written that way would work for all 3 without the extra coding
[01:01:19] <QueryJamesQuery> hi all, i've got problem: i have a draggable inside a div with overflow:auto. When i try to drag the draggable out of the div, it starts scrolling and i can't drag out of the div. does anyone have a solution for this?
[01:01:20] <djQuery> notice that I am using the id attribute to determine what content to toggle in the click
[01:02:01] <djQuery> QueryJamesQuery: in dragstart set the div to not overflow and on end set it back?
[01:02:38] <Kambfhase> QueryJamesQuery: draggable has an appendTo option meaning the element the draggeble will be attachted to while dragging
[01:02:42] <GlobeCrew> djQuery: the code still doesn't work
[01:03:12] <djQuery> sorry man good luck
[01:03:44] <drupalvan> djQuery, Got your point. But still don't know what is wrong in this case. On my English content, if I remove extra class (parag-en) it works but my parag-en class is nothing to do with the class I'm searching for. It could be css problem here?
[01:03:50] <djQuery> but rather than making ur selectors so hard just give all 3 buttons 1 class
[01:04:45] <Kambfhase> are you still talking about http://jsfiddle.net/LnfF2/ ?
[01:04:53] <ankush> Kambfhase, Please see http://pastebin.com/p92F5PNU..
[01:05:43] <GlobeCrew> Kambfhase: yeh i just fixed it 1 sec ago
[01:06:00] <skylamer`> ankush html and hide r u sure ?
[01:06:06] <Kambfhase> k
[01:06:42] <GlobeCrew> Kambfhase: if you had a solution i''d like to compare
[01:06:59] <ankush> skylamer`, yeah.. this is actually done to initialize a variable to send it via for post
[01:07:24] <ankush> skylamer`, with variable i mean an attribute
[01:07:24] <Kambfhase> ankush: http://pastebin.com/TsNv1EWR
[01:07:57] <GlobeCrew> what does return false in a function signify?
[01:08:01] <Kambfhase> GlobeCrew: http://jsfiddle.net/LnfF2/1/
[01:08:35] <Kambfhase> return false is jQuery specific and means event.preventDefault and event.proventPropagation
[01:08:49] <Kambfhase> *stopPropagation
[01:09:33] <GlobeCrew> Kambfhase: yeh thats what i had :). can that code be minimised in any way in both html and js?
[01:09:45] <djQuery> return false is not jquery specific
[01:12:01] <QueryJamesQuery> Kambfhase: i can drag and drop it now, but the image of the helper still isnt visible outside the inner div. and it still scrolls which will make people go crazy ;p
[01:12:16] <djQuery> GlobeCrew: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/LnfF2/2/
[01:13:20] <djQuery> GlobeCrew: to shorten it you could give an id to the li and forgo the a
[01:13:32] <Kambfhase> http://jsfiddle.net/LnfF2/3/
[01:13:58] <djQuery> betcha to it Kambfhase
[01:14:10] <djQuery> beat cha to it
[01:15:14] <Kambfhase> i made yours shorter ;)
[01:15:34] <GlobeCrew> djQuery: not neccessary to have <div id="tabs"> to nest tab 1 to 3?
[01:15:46] <GlobeCrew> kambfhase i mean
[01:15:55] <djQuery> Kambfhase: its still there just moved it up
[01:16:29] <djQuery> but no its not absolutely neccessary
[01:17:47] <djQuery> nite
[01:20:52] <GlobeCrew> e.preventDefault();
[01:21:01] <GlobeCrew> not working for me saying "not defined"
[01:21:30] <GlobeCrew> nevermind me
[01:21:37] <GlobeCrew> fixed it
[01:25:15] <Flynsarmy> I need to send an AJAX request across servers which means i need to use the JSONP data type, however the response won't be in JSON. How can I do this?
[01:26:09] <beilabs__> Hi everyone, any reason why not every element i'm defining as draggable are not able to be dragged?  6/10 of them work...
[01:26:29] <selckin> Flynsarmy: do you know how jsonp works?
[01:26:36] <Flynsarmy> selckin: not really
[01:26:46] <selckin> Flynsarmy: research that then
[01:26:47] <Kambfhase> beilabs__: is your page live?
[01:27:16] <beilabs__> Kambfhase: not a public one....will throw up the jquery code on pastie.
[01:27:29] <Kambfhase> ?p @ beilabs__
[01:27:30] <bot-t> beilabs__, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:29:09] <Flynsarmy> Hmm, anyone here more helpful than selckin?
[01:29:52] <selckin> Flynsarmy: would take 5min of looking into how it works to realise how silly your question is
[01:30:21] <selckin> Flynsarmy: anyway screw you too.
[01:30:22] <Flynsarmy> selckin: would take 5s to answer the question. any question on this channel could be answered with 'go research it'
[01:30:26] <GlobeCrew> selckin: no such thing as a silly question :)
[01:30:28] <Kambfhase> if you encode your other data as a JSON string and decode it later it should be pssible
[01:31:12] <selckin> Flynsarmy: well i can spend 5min typing it in, or you can type 3 words in google and read all about it
[01:31:38] <GlobeCrew> selckin: your a very slow typer :)
[01:31:51] <selckin> GlobeCrew: you're not helping anyone either
[01:31:51] <Flynsarmy> I guess the major problem is that when i do a getJSON or $.ajax datatype=jsonp, it expects gives a js error as it expects a certain type of repsonse that isn't coming
[01:32:14] <beilabs__> Example from issue above: http://jsfiddle.net/Q7ERN/ - some elements can be dragged + dropped, others are not able to be dragged at all. The list is created dynamically.
[01:32:23] <GlobeCrew> selckin: lol, so your admitting that your not helpful. conversation is over.
[01:33:54] <selckin> thats a bit of a jump, but it was his claim yes
[01:34:18] <Kambfhase> beilabs__: $(".drag").draggable; << you're missing () here
[01:35:40] <beilabs__> Kambfhase: yikes, perfect...was looking at that for ages....perfect!
[01:35:43] <beilabs__> thanks dude.

[04:33:32] <smokey> Hello to everyone!
[04:33:54] <smokey> Is there someone here, to help me a bit?
[04:34:12] <smokey> I'm totally new to jQuery
[04:34:26] <smokey> I'v always user cpaint, for ajax evnts.
[04:34:45] <smokey> sorry for my bad typing
[04:35:04] <smokey> my keyboard is a bit struggly at the moment. :D
[04:35:32] <smokey> I would like to setup ajax with jquery
[04:35:53] <smokey> but I don't know how, and haven't found any examples. :(
[04:38:01] <burzum> http://pastebin.com/iJLep3ys any ideas whats wrong here? for some reason charles (debugging proxy) shows me that the request is get and not post
[04:41:04] <ohcibi> how to avoid the selection of text?
[04:43:15] <smokey> as I can see here, youre doing okay.... I guess....
[04:43:17] <smokey> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:43:54] <smokey> Type: "GET" or Type: "POST"
[04:44:06] <smokey> But I can be wong
[04:44:15] <smokey> I'm totally new to jquery
[04:45:16] <smokey> @ ohcibi: do you know any good examples, to setup a ajax event??
[04:45:35] <smokey> so, when you have a DIV container
[04:45:53] <smokey> and load any data to it,
[04:45:58] <smokey> thru a backcall
[04:45:59] <ohcibi> ?
[04:47:14] <smokey> I have an PHP script on the server, that sends data after the correct data has been send
[04:47:37] <smokey> I've always used CPAINT for that
[04:48:03] <smokey> that works fine, but when I include some javascript to it,
[04:48:13] <smokey> that won't work
[04:48:58] <smokey> hope you understand what I mean.....
[04:51:33] <ohcibi> Please note: CPAINT nor this website is under active development.
[04:51:41] <smokey> I know
[04:51:46] <ohcibi> it should be forbidden for some people to build websites
[04:51:51] <smokey> that's why I wonna get rid of it. :)
[04:51:59] <smokey> and like to use jquery
[04:52:08] <ohcibi> then dump it, and rebuild it with jquery
[04:52:24] <smokey> that's what I like to do
[04:52:35] <ohcibi> cool
[04:52:38] <smokey> but I have absolutely no clue how to
[04:53:16] <smokey> I'm not new to javascripting, nor php, nor html
[04:53:36] <smokey> working with it for years now. :)
[04:54:01] <smokey> but jqury.... I don't know where to start
[04:54:57] <ohcibi> $(function() { /** here you start **/ });
[04:55:56] <ohcibi> better yet jQuery(function ($) { /** here you start don't worrying about other js-libs **/ });
[05:02:30] <smokey> ooohm.....
[05:02:45] <smokey> I have an php script on the server
[05:02:51] <smokey> that needs to be called
[05:03:03] <smokey> and needs some data send to it,
[05:03:16] <smokey> so it can send the right data back to the client
[05:03:38] <smokey> that's how i do it with cpaint
[05:26:34] <alexidoia> hello sorry for the misplaced question
[05:26:43] <alexidoia> hello, I am doing a webapp in html/css/ajax and I don't know if there is a API existing for playing video, any ideas ?

[05:35:55] <smokey> and write to it

[06:04:39] <AxonetBE> and the div is display:none; but when I click on the link he show correctly, but on a second click he doesn't go away
[06:07:14] <innociv> How would you click it again when you're hiding it?
[06:09:14] <AxonetBE> innociv: no my link is not hidden
[06:09:32] <innociv> Oh that first one is class

[06:21:09] <harpo_marx> that can actually tell me what generates }); //]]>
[06:21:17] <harpo_marx> in my code

[06:21:31] <harpo_marx> end of cdata
[06:21:39] <harpo_marx> but i did not use that
[06:30:07] <aro> is there a way when using live to prevent other live events from firing?
[06:31:52] <hongymagic> ?event
[06:31:54] <bot-t> hongymagic, Events - These methods are used to register behaviors to take effect when the user interacts with the browser, and to further manipulate those registered behaviors. http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[06:32:04] <hongymagic> ?event.stopPropagation
[06:32:05] <bot-t> event.stopPropagation(): This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[06:32:33] <hongymagic> Since the .live() method handles events once they have propagated to the top of the document, it is not possible to stop propagation of live events.
[06:32:37] <hongymagic> From that link above.
[06:32:49] <aro> all my events are live events
[06:35:42] <kborchers> aro: not sure if this helps but from http://api.jquery.com/live/ "To stop further handlers from executing after one bound using .live(), the handler must return false. Calling .stopPropagation() will not accomplish this."
[06:36:02] <kborchers> Under caveats
[06:36:19] <hongymagic> Returning false will have other side effects too, might want to make sure you really mean return false
[06:37:02] <hongymagic> http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[06:37:16] <kborchers> aro: Also be sure you really want to be using live for everything and not just bind
[06:37:33] <aro> bind? what is the difference?
[06:37:38] <aro> i havent used bind before
[06:37:47] <hongymagic> I think you should be able to use event.stopPropagation() and event.isPropagationStopped()
[06:38:14] <kborchers> ?bind @ aro
[06:38:14] <bot-t> aro, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[06:38:31] <hongymagic> i.e., $('a').live('click', /* this is the second event */ functoin (e) { if (e.isPropagationStopped()) return; });
[06:38:52] <hongymagic> If you stop propgation from the first handler (and order should matter)
[06:39:03] <hongymagic> this should just return undefined and quit handling the event
[06:39:34] <hongymagic> And yes using bind instead of live may help
[06:40:51] <kborchers> aro: From live API doc, "This method is a variation on the basic .bind() method for attaching event handlers to elements. When .bind() is called, the elements that the jQuery object refers to get the handler attached; elements that get introduced later do not, so they would require another .bind() call."
[06:41:23] <aro> ok
[06:53:55] <tman> $(".fbBlurb:contains('')") <- how come that doesn't return objects with no text in them?

[07:10:46] <Ciaran770> was hoping someone could help me, not sure if everyones afk
[07:11:57] <JKarsrud> ?ask @ Ciaran770
[07:11:58] <JKarsrud> :)
[07:11:58] <bot-t> Ciaran770, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:13:21] <JKarsrud> Ciaran770: I'm not afk atleast, and I can see if I can help you out =)
[07:14:45] <Ciaran770> oh hey i think my client is buggy, just got a rush of messages :)
[07:15:34] <JKarsrud> no problemo ;)
[07:16:07] <Ciaran770> Ok here's my question - i'm trying to animate a class, but I want to select it using the ID of the DIV it sits in
[07:16:12] <Ciaran770> my current code is $('#id .class", base.el).stop().animate(hoverState, base.options.speed);
[07:16:58] <JKarsrud> hm, that shouldn't be a problem really.. Could you make a small use case on jsfiddle? :)
[07:18:31] <Ciaran770> i'll give it a try - thanks
[07:32:43] <rethus> what is the clean way to remove (unset) single object out of an array of objects?
[07:33:51] <beloSoweto> Hi, after firefox5 update my page stoped to works and show this error "Index or size is negative or greater than the allowed amount" details in http://pastebin.com/qTxu3TPL how can i debug this if say that error is in jquery library?
[07:38:35] <WebGear> guys i have a strange problem, colorbox is working fine on Google Chrome and IE9 but not in FF4, when i click on the image in FF4 the image opens in a new window as if no JS is present, what seems to be the problem?
[07:41:13] <rethus> what is the clean way to remove (unset) single object out of an array of objects?
[07:43:04] <WebGear> any suggestions about the colorbox not working in FF4?
[07:44:04] <sean`> link?
[07:44:57] <Ciaran770> I gave jsfiddle a go and my code checked out fine - I think my problem is i'm not using the right term to select the class I want to animate
[07:47:42] <Ciaran770> i'm trying to select the DIV to animate using both the ID of it's parent DIV and the class-tag of the DIV itself
[07:48:33] <Ciaran770> so "#ID .class" - what I want to do is select the DIV matching .class, but only if it's parent DIV is #ID
[07:48:52] <GoddeR> #id > .class i think
[07:48:55] <GoddeR> let me check
[07:49:16] <Ciaran770> problem with .class is it selects all DIV with the matching .class
[07:49:32] <GoddeR> http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[07:49:32] <Ciaran770> I only want to select the ones who's parent DIV also match #ID
[07:49:41] <GoddeR> http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[07:49:45] <GoddeR> read that
[07:49:49] <Ciaran770> thanks ill check it out now
[07:49:53] <GoddeR> #id > .class
[07:49:56] <boogyman> Ciaran770: the > means direct descendant
[07:50:07] <boogyman> learn 2 css :P
[08:04:34] <Ciaran770> Confirmed ".class" works, however "#ID > .class" wouldn't - tried "> .class" and that works - #ID must be there in the lib somewhere - thanks all
[08:05:37] <Ciaran770> thanks GoddeR and boogyman I should say
[08:09:32] * imsky yawns
[08:09:52] <runa> heyas. I need to display a datepicker for ISO8601 partial dates ("1977-12", for example), but JQ UI datepicker doesn't seems to support those. any hints?
[08:10:07] <imsky> write your own
[08:11:10] <uni4dfx> help! my table.find('tr:first-child') statement is returning more than one object
[08:11:16] <uni4dfx> how do i access the first one only?
[08:13:28] <imsky> table.find('tr:first-child').first()
[08:14:03] <GoddeR>  table.find('tr:first')
[08:14:03] <uni4dfx> dammit i was googling for that for hours
[08:14:05] <GoddeR> :D
[08:14:10] <uni4dfx> thanks imsky!
[08:14:22] <imsky> no prob
[08:14:27] <uni4dfx> why doesn't x[0] work though?
[08:14:32] <imsky> it should
[08:14:35] <uni4dfx> (assuming i assign the result to x)
[08:14:38] <imsky> that's all .first is
[08:15:01] <runa> ok. it seems the world is not ready for partial dates :)
[08:15:06] <imsky> i'm telling you
[08:15:13] <imsky> either extend datepicker or write your own
[08:15:53] <runa> imsky: yep, but I started used jq because I wanted to take advantage of what it was already done for me;
[08:15:54] <uni4dfx> imsky well i realize that, but x[0].find() doesn't work, while x.first() does
[08:16:09] <uni4dfx> i mean x.first().find()
[08:16:19] <imsky> runa, you'll find jq doesn't exactly solve 100% of all problems
[08:16:46] <imsky> uni4dfx: what a troublesome world we live in :) at least now you have a working selector chain
[08:17:01] <uni4dfx> yeah, it's fine, i was just curious :)
[08:17:04] <uni4dfx> thanks again!
[08:17:06] <imsky> np
[08:17:30] <runa> imsky: I'm not complaining, I'm just trying to find a simple way to do this; the "write your own" answer I had it before even installing jq
[08:17:50] <imsky> yes but all you want to do is just use a different date
[08:17:59] <imsky> so....figure out the datepicker api and add that
[08:18:34] <runa> imsky: you mean, as in a date format?
[08:18:40] <imsky> yes
[08:18:56] <runa> imsky: ah. interesting, letme see
[08:19:43] <Kwpolska> runa: hint: it won't work as you want.
[08:19:56] <Kwpolska> runa: you want to have month and year selection, right?
[08:21:15] <runa> Kwpolska: yep, I just found is not working. exactly, I want "partial dates"
[08:21:36] <Kwpolska> jquery UIâ€…won't help you then.
[08:22:49] <Kwpolska> runa: for example, show a box with <select> jan-dec and <input> for year
[08:22:57] <Kwpolska> and then transform it to a date using some magic
[08:23:53] <runa> Kwpolska: yep, the thing is that I want to accept "partial" or "full dates". I'll start with the 3 selects (day optional). thanks
[08:27:02] <imsky> sounds like....writing your own would be easier
[08:27:15] <JakeyChan> Hey, is there have good plugin for slide content from top to bottom ?
[08:27:35] <runa> imsky: :)

[08:49:13] <nicholas\\> im trying to get all input fields marked class='required' and check if they are empty, but i can only seem to get the first field marked required -> http://pastebin.com/G3MQ0GwQ
[08:49:37] <nicholas\\> nvm, think i found a solution
[08:50:17] <Chib> good because i couldn't make sense of your code! (:
[08:55:14] <Woet> nicholas\\: how do you expect .val() to output it from multiple fields in 1 if?
[08:56:23] <nicholas\\> Woet: dont know what i was thinking. i've solved the problem tho
[08:56:52] <Woet> nicholas\\: http://pastebin.com/jcft9EcG :)
[08:57:00] <Woet> something along those lines
[08:57:10] <nicholas\\> yup
[08:57:34] <Woet> even though i would recommend using the validation plugin
[08:58:14] <GoddeR> http://pastebin.com/mX1zxGfE
[08:58:15] <GoddeR> :D
[08:58:38] <Woet> GoddeR: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[08:59:04] <GoddeR> my version is shorter
[08:59:07] <GoddeR> :D
[08:59:27] <GoddeR> guess not
[08:59:40] <nicholas\\> Woet: yea, i had a look at that, but i only need to validate a few fields so i figured it would be kinda overkill
[08:59:44] <Woet> GoddeR: code isn't defined by how short it is
[08:59:45] <nicholas\\> alltho it might come in handy later
[08:59:54] <Woet> GoddeR: but if you think otherwise, beat this: http://pastebin.com/6ZgtX610
[09:00:35] <Chib> you could remoe some of those semi-colons i'm sure (:
[09:00:43] <Chib> no wia
[09:00:45] <Woet> and I could use 'x' instead of 'emptyFields'
[09:00:47] <Chib> that doesn't make sense!
[09:00:52] <Woet> :p
[09:00:55] <Chib> lol
[09:01:32] <GoddeR> :D
[09:11:55] <Noeble> question: is it posible to create jquery code that does webscraping from the endusers point of view? Instead of doing it in the servercode.
[09:12:41] <Woet> Noeble: external webscraping?
[09:13:14] <Woet> as in, scraping a site that is not the same as where the jquery code is running?
[09:13:28] <Noeble> yes
[09:13:39] <Chib> ajaxxxxx
[09:13:41] <Woet> not without some server side code
[09:14:21] <Noeble> I need to with teh endusers consent, to pull some info from a login protected page to use for registration on my site
[09:14:31] <Noeble> but I can only do that using the endusers active session
[09:14:32] <Chib> you don't need server side code
[09:14:36] <Chib> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[09:14:42] <Chib> ohh
[09:14:43] <Chib> hmm
[09:14:56] <Woet> Chib: and how do you load content from an external site through ajax?
[09:14:59] <Woet> same origin policy?
[09:15:09] <Woet> ?w same origin policy @ Chib
[09:15:11] <bot-t> Chib, Same origin policy - In computing, the same origin policy is an important security concept for a number of browser-side programming languages, such as JavaScript. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[09:15:32] <Chib> ah yeah, forgot about that, sorry s:
[09:15:33] <Woet> ah, better
[09:15:38] <Woet> ?SOP @ Chib
[09:15:39] <bot-t> Chib, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[09:15:40] <Woet> :)
[09:15:53] <Noeble> so.. is it posible? or not? :)
[09:16:01] * Chib will stop giving advice for shit he doesn't know
[09:16:07] <Woet> Noeble: what are you trying to do exactly?
[09:16:23] <GoddeR> wow
[09:16:32] <GoddeR> css channel kicks randomly
[09:16:56] <Noeble> need to verify that the user is who is tells me he is by pulling his email from a password protected site that hes registred on.. and send a verification mail to that adress
[09:17:24] <boogyman> GoddeR: lumos was kicked for being a child
[09:19:07] <GoddeR> but how will the children learn to css well if they get kicked
[09:19:12] <Chib> and there i was thinking you were being ironic
[09:19:15] <Chib> that's disturbing...
[09:19:16] <Noeble> Chib: ther is public profiles, and my site is going to collect stats from these profiles. But I will also allow registrations on my site and connect the account on my site to the public profile and I need to verify that the enduser who enters a URL to the public profile actually is the owner of that profile
[09:19:28] <Noeble> by pulling his email from a pw secrued profile page
[09:19:48] <Chib> Woet: see above ^
[09:19:49] <Chib> (:
[09:22:20] <Noeble> Woet: ops wrote to thewrong guy.. btu look above what I wrote to Chib :)
[09:23:09] <Woet> Noeble: maybe it would be a better idea if you give the user a code he needs to (temporarily) put on his profile?
[09:23:21] <Woet> then you can check server side whether that code is there
[09:24:15] <Noeble> hmm
[09:24:33] <Noeble> the public profile is autogenrated. He cannot change anything there
[09:24:43] <Noeble> else then that it was a briliant idea.. didnt think about that
[09:34:02] <Woet> Noeble
[09:34:07] <Woet> i'm not sure what else you could do
[09:35:08] <Noeble> no me either..
[09:35:12] <Noeble> must be a solution..
[09:38:35] <nbari> .
[09:39:30] <nbari> hi all, any idea of how to detect when browser has been closed not reloaded ?
[09:39:57] <GoddeR> not reloaded?
[09:40:15] <nbari> refresh or reload sorry
[09:40:25] <nbari> Is just that currently I am using the unload
[09:40:34] <nbari> but if the user reload his browser the unload it is called
[09:41:00] <nbari> but wondering how to detect maybe witha  cookie of somethig if it was a refresh/reload vs a close windwos
[09:41:17] <GoddeR> dunno  sry :(
[09:41:48] <nbari> np
[09:44:06] <GoddeR> dont think u can do it
[09:47:37] <Woet> nbari: what does the unload do?
[09:48:00] <nbari> call a function when closing/refreshing the browser
[09:53:01] <zulax> is there any known issue with ajax on jquery and ipad?
[09:53:17] <zulax> on FF and chrome, the ajax works fine and content gets updated,
[09:53:35] <zulax> but on ipod/ipad it just prints out the JSON from php page
[09:54:02] <zulax> instead of just fetching the content, it goes to the page itself
[09:55:04] <Woet> nbari|away: what does that function do?
[09:55:08] <zulax> hmm.. the problem exists in epiphany as well
[09:55:55] <fabiobik> how to make an simple modal box?
[09:56:21] <t432> This line executed the php items.php script is there a way to execute a particular function within the items.php? (url: "script/items.php"),
[09:56:51] <djQuery> nbari|away: if they close when they open they will have a new session. if they just refresh they keep the same session but this is more of a server side thing
[09:56:53] <fabiobik> ?modal
[09:56:53] <bot-t> There are a number of excellent modal plugins for jQuery, including Colorbox (http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) and jQuery UI Dialog (http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/). Want more? http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/. Just don't use Thickbox, for your own sake! The BlockUI plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/block/) can also be useful in providing modality.
[09:57:35] <djQuery> fabiobik: see ?ui.dialog
[09:57:36] <bot-t> fabiobik, A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with the 'x' icon by default. http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[09:58:48] <djQuery> gnarf: you there?
[09:58:55] <djQuery> .seen gnarf
[09:58:56] <hsbot> gnarf was seen 18 hours, 54 minutes and 20 seconds ago, in #jquery-dev, saying: is there any reason for this page to still exist: http://docs.jquery.com/AjaxQueue
[10:05:25] <abjorn> asdf
[10:06:54] <zulax> the ajax call on safari goes to the page itself instead of just fetching the content
[10:11:11] <t432> Trying to call a specific function within this script? (url: "script/items.php"),
[10:12:14] <zulax> t432, you could include that php file in your main page,
[10:12:22] <zulax> then in the main page just call the function
[10:13:47] <t432> so the code will like this. url: "function()" ?
[10:16:37] <t432> zulax: how will i make the ajax call to the function after including it in main file? do i modify this line? url: "script/items.php",
[10:19:57] <zec-> http://jsfiddle.net/fz3FX/ - How come that the alert just pops up with "Undefined" and not the actual value from YOweTotal()? It seems like it fires the alert before the function have returned any data - Any suggestions?
[10:21:59] <djQuery> zec-: alert(YOweTotal);
[10:22:24] <Woet> zec-: getJSON is a threaded function
[10:22:36] <Woet> the function won't wait for it to finish
[10:22:39] <djQuery> zec-: still dont think it will do what u want
[10:22:46] <Woet> it's a callback.
[10:22:50] <systemfault> Woet: Use "Async", not "threaded" :P
[10:22:59] <Woet> systemfault: yes, sir, sorry, sir.
[10:23:16] <Woet> zec-: getJSON is an asynchronized function :)
[10:23:22] <djQuery> systemfault: you need to chagne you nick to sir
[10:23:23] <zec-> hmm.. I've tried async false with $.ajax... same problem.
[10:23:42] <systemfault> djQuery: I would but I've been using systemfault for too long :(
[10:24:06] <systemfault> zec-: The "alert" should be inside the callback
[10:24:08] <Woet> systemfault: thinking about it, why should i trust your opinion with such nick?
[10:24:10] <Woet> maybe you're wrong!
[10:24:18] <systemfault> zec-: Where "return data;"
[10:24:35] <systemfault> Woet: We're on the intarw3bz, sure I could be wrong.
[10:24:44] <zec-> systemfault, ah.
[10:24:48] <Woet> threaded sounds cooler
[10:25:02] <djQuery> damn I hate css. why is the delete button still show? http://jsbin.com/emiluy/2/edit
[10:25:14] <systemfault> zec-: The flow of the program is different than what you think
[10:26:29] <Woet> djQuery: because .button changes the css
[10:26:47] <Woet> to display: inline-block;
[10:26:56] <systemfault> zec-: $(document).ready is ran so YOweTotal() is ran then the ajax transaction begins, the functions ends right away and since YOweTotal doesn't retur anything.. you get undefined.
[10:26:57] <djQuery> Woet: tried commenting ou the .button and it still shows
[10:27:15] <Woet> djQuery: http://jsbin.com/emiluy/3/edit
[10:27:45] <systemfault> zec-: Then a few milliseconds after, the ajax transaction ends, the success callback is called with the data and the date is returned somewhere in space.
[10:27:55] <systemfault> zec-: So you never get the data.
[10:28:05] <zec-> systemfault, I've two functions. One that will calculate what I owe, and one that calculates what people owe me. Now I want to display the values of those two functions in their respective div element, and at the same time I want to do substraction on both of them in order to get the current "Balance".
[10:28:26] <systemfault> zec-: Both are ajax?
[10:28:29] <zec-> How will I know when both of those values are available?
[10:28:29] <zec-> Yes.
[10:28:49] <djQuery> Woet: it doesnt appear that any css I apply to a table caption applies
[10:28:57] <systemfault> zec-: Then you'll have to use "promises"...
[10:29:16] <systemfault> zec-: I've never needed them before but IIRC' jQuery call them "deferred"
[10:29:29] <systemfault> zec-: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/ Example
[10:30:15] <djQuery> systemfault: u beat me to it
[10:30:21] <zec-> Interesting - I'll see if I can figure it out. Anyway, dinner time! - Thanks :)
[10:30:30] <Woet> zec-: http://jsfiddle.net/fz3FX/1/
[10:30:32] <systemfault> zec-: You're welcome.
[10:30:36] <systemfault> djQuery: :P
[10:30:38] <djQuery> zec-: and stop using alert
[10:30:56] <systemfault> console.log is your friend :P
[10:31:13] <Woet> systemfault: not sure what you mean with deferred, but http://jsfiddle.net/fz3FX/1/ works for me
[10:31:23] <Woet> djQuery: it does apply, but the jquery .button overrides it
[10:31:49] <djQuery> zec-: see ?ftjq
[10:31:50] <bot-t> zec-, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[10:32:13] <systemfault> Woet: Deferred does pretty much the same thing than your "if" in parseResult
[10:32:20] <Woet> yay :)
[10:32:27] <systemfault> (but cleaner) :P
[10:32:37] <Woet> ssh
[10:33:01] <Woet> doesn't seem like deferred would work properly with asynced functions though
[10:33:09] <Woet> at least not in that example
[10:34:01] <Woet> oh, it does, cool
[10:35:03] <t432> Can someone tell is it possible to call a particular php function within a script instead of an entire file such as (url: "script/items.php/formSub", )
[10:35:10] <t432> tell me*
[10:35:31] <t432> through ajax

[10:38:51] <djQuery> join \##css
[10:38:54] <hobs> lol
[10:38:59] <systemfault> djQuery: :P
[10:39:18] <systemfault> t432: Doesn't make sense.
[10:41:51] <djQuery> Woet: think its an issue with chrome
[10:41:58] <Woet> djQuery: works on chrome for me
[10:42:24] <djQuery> Woet: do you still see the caption in this one? http://jsbin.com/emiluy/5/edit
[10:42:42] <Woet> how do you mean exactly?
[10:43:05] <Woet> djQuery: oh, yes, i do

[10:54:41] <brianpWins> If I have a script to run from the "onsubmit" in a form. It doesn't get called if I use JS to call submit. Is there a way around this? without moving the code from onsubmit as this is not an option
[10:57:56] <djQuery> $('form').trigger('submit');
[10:58:05] <djQuery> brianpWins: see ?.trigger
[10:58:06] <bot-t> brianpWins, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[10:58:22] <systemfault> djQuery: Just .submit() would work, no?
[10:58:39] <djQuery> systemfault: I think it would
[10:58:41] <brianpWins> nope. I found docs somewhere that say .submit skips onsubmit
[10:59:01] <brianpWins> and submit is an alias for trigger so it would do the same
[10:59:27] <systemfault> Why do you use those damn inline handlers :'(
[10:59:41] <brianpWins> it's the framework that is adding it in =(
[10:59:53] <brianpWins> and I can't get some of the attributes it ads in without letting it add it
[10:59:53] <systemfault> Well, I guess you could cheat
[11:00:14] <t432> guess nobody has a solution for me
[11:00:14] <brianpWins> I just pulled the onsubmit code out via the attr. and am evaling it where I need it
[11:00:21] <systemfault> Get the string from the onsubmit handler
[11:00:28] <systemfault> brianpWins: Haha, I just had the same idea.
[11:00:38] <brianpWins> systemfault: hah, awesome!
[11:00:54] <systemfault> t432: No because it doesn't make any sense.

[11:17:26] <Woet> he wants to repeat it every 60 seconds, so setInterval would be best
[11:19:47] <GoddeR> var myInterval = setInterval(loadURL,60000)
[11:20:26] <rastof> i tried that and nothing happens updated code: http://www.fixee.org/paste/qceq8o3/#url=ltq0ut2
[11:21:04] <GoddeR> you never called the function plus
[11:21:14] <GoddeR> the interval should not be insite the function
[11:21:21] <GoddeR> only setTimeout
[11:21:29] <snover> no, setinterval would *not* be best
[11:21:36] <snover> ?g setinterval harmful @ GoddeR

[11:21:42] <zec-> systemfault, You still around?
[11:22:12] <rastof> could you show me how i'm very new to jquery :/
[11:23:15] <systemfault> zec-: Yes
[11:23:50] <bapi__> how can i intercept passed anchors in jquery?
[11:23:59] <zec-> systemfault, I've tried to implement the $.when() in my code.. but it still returns "undefined" - http://jsfiddle.net/Cp4Np/
[11:24:27] <GoddeR> http://www.fixee.org/paste/qceq8o3/#url=iajoabf
[11:24:31] <bapi__> i want to pass: localhost/home.php#show_5412 then hide the div named: <div id="show_5412"></div> the number 5412 is dynamic
[11:24:35] <GoddeR> rastof: http://www.fixee.org/paste/qceq8o3/#url=iajoabf
[11:24:57] <GoddeR> oh yea
[11:25:05] <GoddeR> must be loadUrl
[11:25:08] <GoddeR> not loadurl
[11:26:21] <rherl23> que tal, me gustaria saber si alguien puede decirme como obtener el codigo html de un div, pero sin recorar es decir:   si yo tengo <div id="design"><input type="text" ></input></div>   y ejecuto la instruccion 		alert($("#design").html());   el resultado es<input type="text" > y   no <input type="text" ></input>
[11:26:37] <systemfault> zec-: I never really used deferred before but it would be something like that http://jsfiddle.net/Cp4Np/1/
[11:26:55] <zec-> ahh
[11:27:29] <zec-> so the data of YOweTotal is passed on to $.when(), that makes sense.
[11:28:25] <zec-> Thanks again, systemfault.
[11:28:34] <systemfault> zec-: And you probably want done and fail instead of then
[11:30:27] <rastof> GoddeR when i test nothing happens
[11:30:43] <rastof> but if i remove the function loadUrl the popup loads but does not refresh
[11:31:35] <zec-> systemfault, the reason for "done" and "fail" instead of "then" is that then takes failed callbacks too - it will trigger no matter what?
[11:32:46] <bapi__> is it possible to pass an anchor to jquery? etc, http://localhost/nome.php#show_div
[11:37:56] <systemfault> zec-: It's to split your "success" and "failure" logic.
[11:38:03] <systemfault> zec-: Then is a "catch all"
[11:40:17] <djQuery> bapi__: or you could use ?see bbq

[11:54:42] <GoddeR> rastof the popupWindow plug
[11:54:52] <GoddeR> rastof you here?
[11:56:30] <bapi__> Is it possible with jquery to determin if the link was accesed with a anchor such as; localhost/home.php#test
[11:56:40] <bapi__> some kind of event
[11:57:57] <GoddeR> rastOf: This should work how you wanted. http://www.fixee.org/paste/qceq8o3/#url=t4qi9j1
[12:03:53] <bapi__> Or better, is it a window.location.hash action in jquery?
[12:07:25] <snover> ?jsisjs @ bapi__
[12:07:25] <bot-t> bapi__, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[12:11:02] <bapi__> thats not a answer for my question
[12:11:14] <bapi__> I want to use jquery with handling hashes
[12:11:38] <abjorn> you might be looking for something like sammyjs
[12:12:09] <bapi__> basically, i want to raise a event whenever the page has # trails, such as: localhost/home.php#test
[12:12:25] <abjorn> yeah, so, sammyjs
[12:12:29] <abjorn> it's a jquery plugin for that
[12:12:40] <abjorn> there's a bunch of other libraries that do that too, though
[12:12:59] <bapi__> kk ill check that out, ty
[12:13:04] <abjorn> np
[12:13:36] <abjorn> temp02: Hey, isn't bot-t your bot? :o
[12:14:06] <quackquack> anyone know if there is a backbone.js irc channel?

[12:48:02] <ankush> i am using chrome.. saw it there? shouldnt be any problem i guess
[12:48:35] <jrockjiggz> well, since your type is post, try encodeURI(uid)
[12:49:35] <ankush> should i mention it in the data field?
[12:49:47] <jrockjiggz> data: encodeURI(uid)
[12:50:03] <ankush> bu ti know its a number..
[12:50:12] <jrockjiggz> but you have a colon

[12:54:13] <danryan> hi folks, I'm having trouble getting jquery to parse a URL that emits a json object: https://gist.github.com/0bd95fe1006f21a4bb8d
[12:55:02] <danryan> where am I going wrong?
[12:56:29] <danryan> I updated the gist with the headers from grabbing the url via curl. It's setting the Content-Type as 'application/json'
[12:56:57] <ankush> danryan, shoudnt the json fields be seperated with a ,
[12:57:17] <jessicaferdes> how to post data in this case http://pastebin.com/T2ZUEL7g
[12:57:18] <ankush> danryan, just guessing here
[12:57:22] <djQuery> danryan: see ?jsonlint
[12:57:23] <bot-t> danryan, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[12:57:34] <jessicaferdes> i want to post the value in the text field

[12:59:43] <Jantire> How do I change what the scrollbar scrolls?
[12:59:47] <jessicaferdes> yea but then i would have to submit all the fileds at one time
[12:59:57] <Jantire> Is there any way for it to instead scroll through Document, to scroll through a different element?
[12:59:59] <jessicaferdes> fields
[13:00:10] <danryan> I figured out where I was going wrong. The data variable is an array, so I needed to call data[0].id, not data.id
[13:00:32] <ankush> :)
[13:00:50] <ankush> can anyone see http://pastebin.com/6y395Hmc. I am having problem in ajax function
[13:01:35] <jrockjiggz> ankush: what is uid?
[13:01:44] <djQuery> jessicaferdes: $.ajax({url: 'myurl', data: {"field": $('#myfield').val()},success:function(data){dosomethinghere} });
[13:02:27] <jrockjiggz> ankush: do what djQuery just wrote

[13:04:31] <jrockjiggz> data : {"UID": uid}
[13:04:43] <ankush> alright.
[13:09:09] <jessicaferdes> djquery would it allow me to submit multiple fields independently
[13:10:10] <jrockjiggz> jessicaferdes: why not data: $(this).serialize() ?
[13:10:35] <ankush> jrockjiggz, thanku , the data is now sent as a JSON object.. now please help me to load the html source recieved by the ajax call
[13:10:35] <jessicaferdes> i dont know it
[13:10:51] <jrockjiggz> if u want multiple, data: {"field1": data1, "field2": data2}

[13:11:53] <jrockjiggz> ankush: your success function looks good, what is the issue?
[13:12:17] <jessicaferdes> http://pastebin.com/T2ZUEL7g

[13:14:35] <djQuery> jessicaferdes: I dont like using post as it doesnt have an error handler
[13:14:57] <jessicaferdes> then you use jquery.ajax?

[13:15:40] <djQuery> jessicaferdes: there are about a 100 different ways you could do this
[13:15:56] <jessicaferdes> lol
[13:16:20] <ankush> jrockjiggz, thankyou :)
[13:17:29] <jessicaferdes>  how do you submit a value in the text field using ajax?

[13:32:18] <b1lly1> test
[13:32:44] <ankush> i have got the html source of a page using ajax , i want it to be loaded in the same page-> tried $('html').html(data) but it messes it up? any suggestions?
[13:33:19] <jrockjiggz> do you want to replace the whole page??
[13:33:35] <ankush> yeah.
[13:33:40] <jrockjiggz> $('body') would be more appropriate
[13:33:45] <djQuery> ankush: $('body').load('url', function(){this runs when its done});
[13:34:31] <djQuery> ankush: define messes it up?
[13:36:47] <ankush> djQuery, jrockjiggz, html page from ajax has its own html and body tags. $('html').html(data) loses the body tag to be exact.. just the content within remains
[13:38:03] <jrockjiggz> ankush: you need a framework. checkout rails
[13:40:06] <ankush> havent u expert guys ever tried this?  loading a html page when u cant reload it by window.top.href because of same origin policy
[13:40:39] <fwaokda> I'm trying to do this... -- http://pastebin.com/THEEFzvW -- but it's not working.  Is it not possible to do something like this with jquery?
[13:40:48] <smykes24> http://pastebin.com/b58MHZgX  How do I pass this to the fade out function?
[13:41:31] <jrockjiggz> $(this).fadeOut()
[13:42:20] <ankush> djQuery, jrockjiggz, it seems just body and head tags are missing..this is what i was telling about being messed up
[13:42:25] <smykes24> all there is to it jrockjiggz ?
[13:42:40] <jrockjiggz> yes in the click function
[13:42:46] <codeisforevea> anyone have success with jplayer and jquerymobile before?	
[13:43:01] <smykes24> nice
[13:43:04] <smykes24> thats easy
[13:43:10] <smykes24> i think i did it differently last time
[13:43:50] <smykes24> huh but now its fading all the way out i must be missing an argment in the fae function
[13:45:17] <jrockjiggz> smykes24: i missunderstood your question
[13:45:48] <jrockjiggz> smykes24: fadeOut is a jquery function, you shouldn't name your function this
[13:46:07] <smykes24> oh ok
[13:46:12] <smykes24> do you understand what im doing now?
[13:46:29] <jrockjiggz> if you want to custom fade level, set your level as a var, and fadeTo(fadeVar)
[13:47:17] <smykes24> but .5 should work
[13:47:44] <jrockjiggz> yes, $(this).fadeTo(0.5); should work
[13:48:16] <smykes24> http://pastebin.com/9Tga0FqL
[13:49:00] <smykes24> i seem to have broken it
[13:50:13] <jrockjiggz> smykes24: http://pastebin.com/3hBV7nkS
[13:50:48] <smykes24> jrockjiggz: yeah I know how to do that but there are a bunch of numbers to click
[13:50:56] <smykes24> so i just want to call that function
[13:51:04] <smykes24> like fadeNumber
[13:52:49] <jrockjiggz> http://pastebin.com/U6CuVmgM
[13:53:36] <smykes24> what is the jQobject?
[13:53:43] <jrockjiggz> $(this)
[13:54:05] <jrockjiggz> aka $('.number1')
[13:54:52] <smykes24> why is one called fadeLevel and one fadeVar?
[13:55:23] <jrockjiggz> fadeLevel is a variable, farVar is used only in the function
[13:56:14] <smykes24> hrm
[13:56:17] <smykes24> k i think i get it
[13:56:53] <jrockjiggz> ?101 @ smykes24
[13:56:53] <bot-t> smykes24, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[13:56:59] <smykes24> sorry just trying to understand completly
[13:57:05] <smykes24> yeah i have been reading books
[13:57:20] <jrockjiggz> this ones legit
[13:57:28] <smykes24> is there another term that you can use for $(this) besides jQobjects
[13:57:40] <smykes24> jrockjiggz: i usually reference jquery fundamentals
[13:57:43] <jrockjiggz> it can be whatever you want, i just made that up
[13:58:07] <jrockjiggz> its just a variable name passed to the function
[13:58:07] <djQuery> this is cool http://jquery.github.com/jquery-tmpl/demos/movies/PagesCore/movies.html
[13:58:32] <smykes24> jrockjiggz: how does it know that jQobjects is this?
[13:59:17] <jrockjiggz> djQuery: if you've selected more than 1 of the same, you can only remove all, not reduce the count
[13:59:52] <jrockjiggz> is that with tmpl ? cool stuff
[14:00:37] <djQuery> jrockjiggz: well you could just type int he quaintity
[14:01:01] <djQuery> jrockjiggz: I didnt make it by the way
[14:01:18] <jrockjiggz> o didnt know that
[14:01:29] <jrockjiggz> ok i thought u did
[14:01:41] <djQuery> jrockjiggz: it would be kinda stuck up if I said something I made was cool
[14:01:41] <jrockjiggz> lol i'll be quiet now
[14:02:09] <jrockjiggz> shameless plug is shameless
[14:03:25] <smykes24> thankyou for your help jrockjiggz
[14:03:49] <jrockjiggz> np
[14:04:20] <smykes24> fade works in IE too?
[14:05:21] <systemfault> Why not?
[14:05:40] <dabear> nothing works in IE
[14:11:02] <fwaokda> I'm trying to do this... -- http://pastebin.com/THEEFzvW -- but it's not working.  Is it not possible to do something like this with jquery?
[14:12:00] <b1lly1> fwaokda: that is jquery...
[14:12:08] <djQuery> fwaokda: try console.log(id) in there
[14:12:11] <lazyPower> fwaokda: that is to set the volume of the youtube player correct?
[14:12:18] <brianpWins> this: http://jsbin.com/evojer/edit#source didn't work. just stops the form from doing anything at all. the onsubmit code still doesn't get executed.
[14:12:38] <fwaokda> djQuery, ok
[14:12:39] <brianpWins> systemfault: evaling the string from onsubmit doesn't work becuase it changes the context of "this"
[14:13:03] <fwaokda> lazyPower, im trying to set the volume sliders from jquery ui to it
[14:13:30] <djQuery> brianpWins: then cache this  $t = $(this)
[14:13:51] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, Is it possible to know if a jquery plugin is just loaded or not? I've a script that needs some plugins to work but there are some pages in which plugins are just loaded by other scripts... is it possible? thanks
[14:14:06] <brianpWins> djQuery: don't have the option. the string is being auto generated by something I have no control over
[14:14:29] <djQuery> then stop using it
[14:14:39] <brianpWins> yeah don't have that option either
[14:15:15] <systemfault> brianpWins: I Think I have an idea.
[14:15:56] <systemfault> x begin the content of onsubmit: var handler = new Function(x); x.call(theThisThatYouWant);
[14:16:01] <systemfault> Errr
[14:16:06] <systemfault> x begin the content of onsubmit: var handler = new Function(x); handler.call(theThisThatYouWant);
[14:16:16] <systemfault> I suck.. sorry
[14:16:24] <systemfault> ( i never use new Function
[14:17:17] <brianpWins> systemfault: 		eval($('#attendance_form').attr('onsubmit').replace("this", "$('#attendance_form')")); did to a point lol. I'm not sure I fully understand what your function is doing
[14:17:36] <systemfault> lol
[14:17:50] <systemfault> This is the definition of evil.
[14:17:54] <brianpWins> hah
[14:18:02] <systemfault> Even if it does work.. I'd probably find a better way.
[14:18:14] <djQuery> mbutubuntu: if(jQuery && jQuery.fn.pluginname){ console.log('yeah my plugin is here');}
[14:18:57] <systemfault> ?eval var myOnSubmit = "return this + 10;";  var handler = new Function(myOnSubmit); handler.call(5);
[14:18:59] <bot-t> systemfault: 15
[14:19:06] <systemfault> brianpWins:^^
[14:20:13] <mbutubuntu> djQuery, thanks
[14:20:41] <djQuery> mbutubuntu: lol keep reading that as m but
[14:20:59] <brianpWins> ahhh systemfault i get it now thanks!
[14:21:21] <djQuery> mbutubuntu: else { $.getScript('someurl', customfunctiontodotherestofstuff)
[14:21:39] <djQuery> mbutubuntu: also you may want to look at see ?yepnope
[14:21:40] <bot-t> mbutubuntu, yepnope is an asynchronous conditional resource loader that's super-fast, and allows you to load only the scripts that your users need: http://yepnopejs.com/
[14:23:27] <systemfault> djQuery: Is yepnode better than let's say... require.js?
[14:23:46] <djQuery> systemfault: havenet looked at require is all
[14:24:01] <djQuery> or yepnode
[14:24:13] <systemfault> Ah ok, so you never needed a loader before
[14:24:34] <mbutubuntu> djQuery, it seems amazing :-)
[14:24:38] <djQuery> no was makin fun that u miss spilled yepnope
[14:24:54] <systemfault> djQuery: Ah...
[14:28:27] <angelleye> I've got one site with a hidden sidebar that you click to show/hide.  I'm trying to move that feature to another site and I'm having some issues.  Anybody around that could help me out real quick?
[14:28:56] <angelleye> http://sandbox.mobileswiper.com/ has the working sidebar (our solutions) that I'm trying to move to http://beta-sandbox.usbswiper.com/
[14:29:00] <djQuery> angelleye: if its hidden how do you click it?
[14:29:16] <angelleye> well, there's a side button that's not hidden...you'll see
[14:29:26] <angelleye> i've got it displaying on the new site with CSS but my jQuery isn't working for me
[14:29:40] <angelleye> it conflicts with my slider, for one, and the side bar still doesn't work for me anyway
[14:29:57] <angelleye> the function is in there now under Author:  Simon Bouchard
[14:30:00] <smurfke> jPanelQuery is not defined on site 2 angelleye
[14:30:30] <angelleye> smrfke:  i was playing with it tha way because when I do jQuery.noConflict() it breaks my home page slider
[14:30:50] <angelleye> and i still haven't goten the side bar to work either way
[14:31:01] <smurfke> ok, can't help you any further right now, I need to go soz
[14:31:50] <djQuery> Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL http://beta-sandbox.usbswiper.com/ from frame with URL http://www.youtube.com/embed/BNeKpdp1fxQ. Domains, protocols and ports must match.
[14:32:24] <djQuery> angelleye: what framework is the usbswipper using?
[14:32:41] <djQuery> or whatever ou ssaid was breaking
[14:33:07] <angelleye> the usbswiper website is using jquery 1.4.4
[14:33:16] <Famic> hi
[14:33:19] <angelleye> which i updated to that from 1.4.3 because the mobileswiper site is using 1.4.4
[14:35:07] <abjorn-out> Damn. 5.1 Altec Lansing speakers sound really fuckin' great, even with stereo input.
[14:35:20] <djQuery> angelleye: so can it read the pin# off debit cards as well?
[14:35:46] <angelleye> oh, you're interested in the actual product
[14:35:54] <djQuery> not realy
[14:35:57] <angelleye> i thought you were talking about the question I've got.
[14:36:06] <angelleye> the card swipe solution doesn't use jquery
[14:36:22] <djQuery> I dont see anything in it that would cause you to need the noconflict
[14:36:43] <angelleye> ok, i just copied it from the previous site that had it working.  i'm a jquery (and javacsript in general) novice
[14:36:47] <djQuery> so the main thing is the that the error in console
[14:37:23] <djQuery> jPanelQuery is not defined
[14:37:38] <djQuery> ?ftjq@ angelleye
[14:37:39] <bot-t> angelleye, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:37:46] <angelleye> ok, yeah, i had changed it to that becuase jQuery.noConflict() was breaking my home page slider
[14:39:03] <Famic> anyone familiar with jquerymobile ? It can't manage to make it enhance the style of my radio/checkboxes
[14:39:39] <Famic> I'm using the same markup I see in the doc
[14:40:00] <angelleye> djQuery:  you said I don't need noConflict.  If I just remove that then what do I set for jPanel = ..??
[14:40:08] <pielgrzym> what is wrong with this binding: $('input.someclass').bind("keyup.filter_stuff", some_callback) ? it's never triggered by writing anything in input element. keydown doesn't work too - keypress only works. why?
[14:40:13] <pielgrzym> latest jquery btw
[14:42:58] <angelleye> oh, i'm close!
[14:43:10] <fwaokda> how can i make sure my jquery code runs after all javascript has ran on my page?
[14:43:10] <angelleye> i removed the new var jPanel with noconflict all together
[14:43:17] <angelleye> and i replaced all the jPanel's with $'s
[14:43:32] <angelleye> now my side bar is functioning but i'm losing my tab when it's active for some reason...
[14:46:33] <angelleye> got it
[14:46:34] <angelleye> :)
[14:54:23] <palhmbs> I'm trying to convert <section> tags into div's with jquery - I thought html5 shim would've done it for me
[14:54:42] <palhmbs> my page looks great in FF5 & Opera 11 - just not IE7-8
[14:55:16] <palhmbs> any ideas on how I might convert it into a div ?
[14:55:29] <djQuery> palhmbs: why not just get a html5 shiv
[14:56:01] <djQuery> palhmbs: do a find and replace for <section with <div etc
[14:56:24] <palhmbs> on --  http://code.google.com/p/html5shim/ --- it says: Common question: what's the difference between the html5shim and the html5shiv? Answer: nothing, one has an m and one has a v - that's it.
[14:56:43] <palhmbs> find and replace in my text editor?
[14:56:47] <palhmbs> your kidding right?
[14:57:53] <pielgrzym> why the heck doesn't keyup/keydown work at all in FF/Chrome??
[15:00:29] <snover> palhmbs: kidding less than the idea that html5 shims convert tags into other tags
[15:05:09] <innociv> pielgrzym, it does work
[15:06:41] <palhmbs> snover, ok so I'm totally confused - when somebody linked to html5 shim saying it'd add support for HMTL5 elements in < IE 9, that's what I thought it'd do...
[15:06:56] <snover> it does.
[15:06:58] <snover> kind of.
[15:07:13] <palhmbs> steps for simple setup?
[15:07:21] <snover> rtfm? :)
[15:07:47] <palhmbs> yeah thanks - I guess this isn't a on-topic question really anyway
[15:08:29] <palhmbs> what I was hoping to do, instead of using html5 shim was just rewrite it to a <div> element _IF_ < IE 9
[15:08:44] <snover> how is that supposed to be better?
[15:08:52] <palhmbs> can jQuery rewrite DOM elements on the fly like that?
[15:09:08] <snover> no.
[15:09:25] <palhmbs> < IE8 is totally screwing with my CSS.
[15:09:45] <innociv> Really?  IE8 css tends to be fine for me
[15:09:48] <palhmbs> it may be because I'm using the new rbga I guess
[15:09:56] <snover> why do you think javascript is the solution to your css problems, curiously?
[15:10:23] <palhmbs> javascript rewrites loads of CSS for me...
[15:10:29] <palhmbs> when I need it to....
[15:10:31] <snover> ur doing it wrong.
[15:10:31] <innociv> The browser rarely seems to be the issue now days.
[15:10:42] <mzulinsky> .PSD Templates for sale! 100 % UNIQUE, ORIGINAL LAYERS, ETC.! More prv me.
[15:10:55] <innociv> Yes, the browser may reformat css property values.
[15:10:56] <palhmbs> actually lot's of site use display: none from javascript to make things more fantastic
[15:10:58] <innociv> But it's not so bad
[15:11:33] <innociv> palhmbs, I now know even less of what you're trying to say.
[15:11:34] <jessicaf> why dont i get the alert box http://pastebin.com/LcubQV3Z
[15:11:40] <palhmbs> let me try fixing my stuff before I moan more about not rtfm on html5 shim :P
[15:11:41] <snover> palhmbs: if lots of sites jumped off a bridge would you do it too?
[15:12:10] <palhmbs> snover, if it gave me more customers and didn't kill : sure! :
[15:12:10] <innociv> javascript manipulates css and html.  That does NOT make it css or html.
[15:14:46] <catshirt> hi all
[15:14:56] <catshirt> i think i encountered some jquery weirdness but theres a few moving parts so im not sure
[15:15:13] <catshirt> in short... i think jquery is artificially inserting an index into my data where it shouldnt: http://pastebin.com/vGzKQT73
[15:15:44] <catshirt> particularly, when my server inspects points, it seems to have an extra initial index here: points: { '0':
[15:16:54] <catshirt> so when i try to access my points array, i have to access it like points[0] instead of just points... sorry if im not clear
[15:17:51] <innociv> jquery ?
[15:17:54] <innociv> That's every language.
[15:18:01] <catshirt> huh?
[15:18:02] <innociv> Every language has an index for arrays.
[15:18:16] <catshirt> the initial one is artificial though
[15:18:24] <innociv> C, C#, PHP, Java, all of them.
[15:18:30] <catshirt> maybe im not being clear
[15:18:44] <catshirt> particularly, i want to be able to save my model so i can access the points array directly
[15:18:47] <catshirt> model.points = []
[15:18:57] <catshirt> but when jquery posts to my server, the data requires the initial index to be manipulated
[15:18:59] <catshirt> ie
[15:19:02] <catshirt> model.points[0] = []
[15:19:19] <innociv> you want the 0 key to be blank?
[15:19:28] <catshirt> no, there shouldnt be a 0 key
[15:19:34] <catshirt> its not an array, whose first item is an array
[15:19:42] <innociv> Indexes start at 0.
[15:19:48] <catshirt> i know.
[15:19:59] <catshirt> what if you do this
[15:20:03] <catshirt> var x = ['a', 'b']
[15:20:08] <jessicaferdes> hello can someone please tell me why the alert(1) message box doesnt pop up in this code
[15:20:10] <catshirt> to access a, do you have to do
[15:20:11] <jessicaferdes> http://pastebin.com/LcubQV3Z
[15:20:14] <catshirt> x[0][0]?
[15:20:15] <catshirt> no, you dont
[15:20:18] <catshirt> you just acess x[0]
[15:20:26] <catshirt> because x doesnt require an index, its an array
[15:20:52] <innociv> x[0][0] would return a null
[15:21:00] <catshirt> i know... alright thanks anyway
[15:21:02] <innociv> x[0] would be a
[15:21:06] <catshirt> right.
[15:21:07] <catshirt> but jquery
[15:21:10] <catshirt> is creating the object like this:
[15:21:15] <catshirt> x = [['a', 'b']]
[15:21:22] <catshirt> its *adding* an index
[15:21:42] <catshirt> i pass in ['a', 'b'] to ajax, and my server gets [['a', 'b']]
[15:21:47] <innociv> In that case x[0][0] would be a
[15:21:58] <catshirt> i know how array indexes work
[15:22:16] <catshirt> in sum:
[15:22:20] <innociv> How do you except x = ['a', 'b'],['c', 'd']; to work?
[15:22:25] <innociv> expect*
[15:22:29] <catshirt> dude i dont have that
[15:22:32] <catshirt> to be clear:
[15:22:34] <catshirt> 1): i pass ['a', 'b'] to ajax
[15:22:44] <catshirt> 2): my server gets [['a','b']]
[15:23:03] <innociv>  I don't believe you :x
[15:23:06] <catshirt> k
[15:23:44] <catshirt> im still digging, but i have a pretty narrow test case
[15:23:48] <palhmbs> so anyway I just found - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/289225/does-internet-explorer-8-support-html-5/3746162#3746162
[15:24:09] <djQuery> catshirt: keep missing the r in ur nick
[15:26:13] <catshirt> i think i might be using the bodyParser wrong or something ... D:
[15:28:46] <catshirt> alright, thanks innociv, youre right i dont think its jquery
[15:28:57] <catshirt> think i am decoding body poorly
[15:29:11] <innociv> It's javascript, or any language with arrays, and it's working as it should in your paste.
[15:32:50] <catshirt> a *ha*
[15:32:52] <djQuery> palhmbs: http://html5test.com/results.html
[15:33:00] <catshirt> i dont want to open my big mouth again but
[15:33:07] <catshirt> i think it might be in mongoose actually or something
[15:33:12] <catshirt> anyway ill shut up until i figure ito ut ;)
[15:34:09] <palhmbs> thanks djQuery -- I also found - http://kilianvalkhof.com/2010/css-xhtml/how-to-use-rgba-in-ie/
[15:34:15] <palhmbs> which fixes my background colors
[15:34:22] <catshirt> yup, innociv, check it http://pastebin.com/LRbLCssE
[15:34:46] <catshirt> guess i should take out my orm before i consider something a narrow test case :]
[15:35:00] <innociv> hm?
[15:35:12] <innociv> You may want to JSON stringify when you console log it
[15:35:23] <catshirt> this is from node, fence is a mongo object
[15:35:29] <catshirt> it strinigifies automatically
[15:35:47] <catshirt> but seems like once i assign the array to the model, the model property is no longer just the array
[15:38:10] <innociv> jquery doesn't even extend arrays or objects at all like mootools does
[15:43:29] <djQuery> innociv: err good? jquery doesnt extend much anything
[15:43:42] <innociv> It was a reply to catshirt.
[15:43:44] <djQuery> innociv: which is whats good about it
[15:43:53] <innociv> But personally, I love mootools array and object extensions
[15:44:01] <innociv> .include and .remove are fantastic
[15:45:02] <innociv> http://mootools.net/docs/core/Types/Array best thing in mootools, imo.
[15:50:07] <Famic> jquerymobile does what I expect on my computer but I only get a blank page when visiting the site with a mobile phone :( Any idea .
[15:50:08] <Famic> ?
[15:50:44] <innociv> And the jquery mobile site works on it?  No idea
[15:53:36] <Famic> the android emulator shows a blank page, my real phone running webOs 1.4 adds a "loading" box on top of the blank page
[16:12:24] <pielgrzym> hi, say I've got an input field. when I attach a keypress event callback that takes $(this).val() and does some changes to it and then sets the changed value: $(this).val(new_value); - why doesn't this include the last typed character??
[16:13:04] <Segaja> try a keyup event
[16:13:10] <Segaja> that has the correct value
[16:13:17] <pielgrzym> Segaja: keyup does not work in FF5
[16:13:22] <pielgrzym> nor keydown
[16:13:22] <Segaja> maybe the events are triggered in the wrong order
[16:13:24] <Segaja> oO
[16:13:30] <Segaja> it works fine for me in FF7 nightlies
[16:13:33] <shesek> pielgrzym, that makes no sense
[16:13:50] <shesek> woot? 7?
[16:14:12] <Segaja> mozilla-central-latest branch
[16:14:16] <pielgrzym> Segaja: on FF5 (arch linux build) even the demos of keyup/keydown on jquery docs don't work, believe me
[16:14:17] <Segaja> the direct repo builds
[16:14:27] <pielgrzym> shesek: what make no sense?
[16:14:30] <Segaja> pielgrzym: that must be a bug in FF5
[16:15:16] <shesek> pielgrzym, that keyup won't work
[16:15:31] <shesek> it can't be intentional, its either a bug in FF5 or it was compiled badly or something
[16:15:36] <Segaja> pielgrzym: i'm also on archlinux with the latest build from the mozilla ftp server
[16:16:04] <pielgrzym> this does a mess: https://gist.github.com/1047003 - and it should change numbers on the fly like: 10000 -> 10 000
[16:16:37] <pielgrzym> now in firebug I've observed that in line 11 it gets a value without the latest typed char that's why it doesn't work
[16:16:47] <pielgrzym> shesek: you're right
[16:16:52] <pielgrzym> it didn't
[16:17:18] <pielgrzym> Segaja: perhaps it's the pentadactyl nightly build that makes a mess
[16:17:30] <Segaja> hm, i would guess so
[16:17:40] <Segaja> but i'm using vimperator and it works fine
[16:17:45] <pielgrzym> try $('input.someclass').formatInput();
[16:18:06] <pielgrzym> Segaja: then it must be pentadactyl (vimperator fork, much faster though)
[16:18:18] <Segaja> i know what pentadactyl is
[16:18:26] <pielgrzym> ah :) ok
[16:18:27] <Segaja> but i think it is more broken in some features
[16:18:33] <Segaja> disable pentadactyl and try again
[16:18:43] <Segaja> IIRC it is restardless nowadays
[16:20:06] <pielgrzym> Segaja: right, a pentadactyl horrible flaw :/
[16:20:13] <Segaja> haha
[16:20:21] <Segaja> sry :D
[16:20:24] <pielgrzym> np
[16:20:28] <Segaja> i'm kind of a vimp maintainer :D
[16:20:40] <pielgrzym> I think the author should be kicked in balls for this bug
[16:21:00] <pielgrzym> I spend f*kin 3 hours trying to find mistake in my code :/ sheesh
[16:21:11] <pielgrzym> nonetheless
[16:21:13] <Segaja> http://code.google.com/p/dactyl/issues/detail?id=524&q=keyup
[16:21:59] <pielgrzym> any way to get "latest" input value in that event somehow? without doing a masking-unmasking masacre with some hidden elements?
[16:22:35] <Segaja> keyup event :P
[16:22:51] <pielgrzym> Segaja: try out the code please. it's keyup event
[16:22:59] <pielgrzym> https://gist.github.com/1047003
[16:23:02] <pielgrzym> Segaja: ^
[16:23:14] <pielgrzym> usage: $("input.blah").formatInput()
[16:23:14] <Segaja> you see dactyl is faster and has more features, but the idea behind vimperator nowadays is to make the features that exist more stable
[16:23:43] <pielgrzym> Segaja: I don't care about features - I want it to be lightning fast :)
[16:24:33] <Segaja> vimp is fast enough for me
[16:25:12] <Segaja> your code has syntax errors
[16:25:42] <pielgrzym> Segaja: I'll try it out then :)
[16:25:58] <pielgrzym> Segaja: where?
[16:26:25] <Segaja> in formatInput $elem is defined as global var
[16:26:40] <pielgrzym> ah, right
[16:26:53] <Segaja> and in last bad one line is a ; missing
[16:27:18] <Segaja> hang on how the hack do you bind the event?
[16:27:45] <pielgrzym> line 8
[16:27:46] <Segaja> what was the usage?
[16:28:02] <pielgrzym> $("input").formatInput();
[16:28:11] <Segaja> and then it should do what on keyUp?
[16:28:41] <pielgrzym> Segaja: it should insert spaces in numbers after each third digit: 10000 -> 10 000
[16:28:53] <pielgrzym> line 16 is ok
[16:29:05] <pielgrzym> it's not efficient but has no error
[16:29:26] <pielgrzym> the only problem is that in line 12 initial_value does not hold the most recently typed char
[16:29:36] <Segaja> hm, not working for me atm
[16:30:44] <Segaja> ok it works
[16:30:49] <Segaja> 1000 > 1 000
[16:31:02] <Segaja> but if you then add another 0 you get: 1 0 000
[16:31:05] <pielgrzym> yes
[16:31:16] <Segaja> so there is an error
[16:31:26] <pielgrzym> try comparing the initial_value in firebug's console
[16:31:44] <Segaja> no firebug installed atm
[16:31:53] <pielgrzym> if you have typed the first number initial_value is undefined, with two numbers it holds only first etc
[16:31:54] <Segaja> it is screwing up an other addon
[16:31:59] <Segaja> but hang on chrome has some debugger
[16:32:15] <pielgrzym> yeah :)
[16:32:40] <Segaja> lol
[16:32:51] <Segaja> hm, the initial_value is fine for me
[16:33:05] <pielgrzym> ah, you're right
[16:33:09] <pielgrzym> it was wrong with keydown
[16:33:18] <pielgrzym> I'll try stripping spaces before substituting
[16:33:45] <Segaja> yeah, thats it
[16:33:47] <Segaja> just testet it
[16:33:48] <pielgrzym> yeah
[16:33:54] <pielgrzym> Segaja: thanks a lot for help! :)
[16:33:55] <Segaja> in line 16
[16:34:03] <pielgrzym> yes?
[16:34:10] <Segaja> return number.replace(' ', '').replace(/(\d)(?=(?:\d{3})+$)/g, "$1 ");
[16:34:14] <Segaja> that works
[16:34:31] <pielgrzym> Segaja: yup :) thanks a lot :)
[16:34:34] <Segaja> also why are you capsulating the replace in a new function?
[16:34:43] <Segaja> why not do it directly in line 13?
[16:35:03] <Segaja> elem.val(initial_value.replace(' ', '').replace(/(\d)(?=(?:\d{3})+$)/g, "$1 "));
[16:35:03] <Segaja> ?
[16:36:07] <pielgrzym> Segaja: no valid reason, just wanted to have the exact replacement function isolated since this replacement is very inefficient - like O(n^2)
[16:36:27] <Segaja> yeah, one could improve on that
[16:36:46] <Segaja> you could substr it :D
[16:36:59] <Segaja> i have done something like that in php to make 1000 to 1.000
[16:38:59] <Segaja> uhm, what does the .filter_input in the bind line?
[16:39:06] <pielgrzym> Segaja: I'd also like to make it not type non-numeric chars and have an optional errback if one types a non-numeric char so you could highlight the input etc
[16:39:37] <pielgrzym> Segaja: just an event name so I can unbind it easier if the reason comes :)
[16:39:46] <Segaja> i see
[16:39:55] <pielgrzym> and initial name was filter_input not format_input :D
[16:39:55] <Segaja> i always use ele.keyup(function() {...});
[16:40:20] <pielgrzym> Segaja: I prefer bind - I can bind to couple events this way
[16:40:36] <pielgrzym> but generally - I'm a python programmer and I really suck at js :D
[16:41:11] <Segaja> pielgrzym: so you have to match your value for anything that is not a number
[16:41:14] <Segaja> after you striped it
[16:41:27] <pielgrzym> yes
[16:41:37] <pielgrzym> I'll spawn a github repo for this tiny thing
[16:41:37] <Segaja> shouldn't be too hard
[16:42:03] <Segaja> a better question is why my HTML table is broken again
[16:42:26] <pielgrzym> Segaja: html table?
[16:43:01] <Segaja> yeah, i'm workin on some own code
[16:43:10] <Segaja> and it is the third time this table is broken
[16:43:47] <pielgrzym> I hate tables
[16:44:00] <pielgrzym> they have some advantages though
[16:44:16] <Segaja> yeah, and jquery has a bug if you want to slide upen a floated element
[16:44:17] <pielgrzym> like a comfortable way to align shit vertically
[16:44:28] <Segaja> it applays the CSS rules after the sliding is complete
[16:44:38] <pielgrzym> oh
[16:44:51] <Segaja> which has the nasty side effect of making the whole content under the slided element wobble
[16:46:18] <pielgrzym> Segaja: I mentioned you in the answer to (my own) question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6468327/how-to-format-numbers-dynamically-in-input-field
[16:47:46] <Segaja> thanks

[17:05:20] <ijqman> any advice
[17:09:23] <yogurt_truck> can anyone reproduce this? http://jsfiddle.net/Nw3uw/3/
[17:10:09] <yogurt_truck> pressing CMD, fn, shift, or alt, triggers a mousemove on Safari?
[17:10:18] <yogurt_truck> both on keyup and on keydown
[17:11:49] <yogurt_truck> didn't use jquery for attaching to the mousemove there, but i did try it and the same thing happens
[17:13:32] <Segaja> pielgrzym you got a prv msg

[17:29:28] <kaepora> Hi guys, how can I make some text inside a <p> fade into new text when I click a button, using jQuery?
[17:32:23] <coldhead> ?fadetoggle
[17:32:24] <bot-t> coldhead, .fadeToggle() - Display or hide the matched elements by animating their opacity. http://api.jquery.com/fadeToggle/
[17:33:04] <abjorn> coldhead: Hey, isn't bot-t temp01's bot?
[17:33:19] <coldhead> i hear they are an item, yes
[17:33:29] <abjorn> hey temp02, WAKE UP
[17:34:38] <coldhead> what the hell is the problem?
[17:34:44] <coldhead> tempsy is very busy
[17:34:47] <abjorn> no problem
[17:34:48] <abjorn> o ok
[17:35:05] <abjorn> just wanted to offer hosting bot-t on my vps so it's not down all the time
[17:35:19] <coldhead> oh we tried that
[17:35:23] <coldhead> HE NO LIKEE
[17:35:26] <abjorn> oh :o
[17:35:29] <abjorn> well that's lame
[17:35:31] <abjorn> why is that?
[17:35:44] <coldhead> lord knows
[17:35:55] <abjorn> well that sux :<
[17:36:01] <coldhead> kaepora: http://jsfiddle.net/yNmXb/1/
[17:36:07] <abjorn> The only thing I'm using it for is hosting a bot for another channel so lol
[17:37:07] <coldhead> kapowaz: http://jsfiddle.net/yNmXb/2/
[17:37:28] <coldhead> abjorn: you will note that the sauce to bot-t is not available anywhere
[17:37:41] <abjorn> Yeah, I figured it would have something to do with that.
[17:37:48] <coldhead> right on
[17:38:35] <coldhead> i think bot-t runs on windows
[17:38:53] <kaepora> coldhead: <3
[18:05:34] <coldhead> quiet as the grave
[18:19:23] <rhizmoe> is there a common reason why image backgrounders (scaling background images) don't work on every pageload?
[18:24:14] <innociv> It'd be nice if jquery recognized how retarded I am and .addClass('.class'); would work.  Just strip out those dots. :x  I guess it'd be a tad slower, though.
[18:25:04] <systemfault> I don't think so, jQuery already has too much magic IMHO.
[18:35:23] <innociv> Heh
[18:35:54] <innociv> It's the one small thing that slips me up a ton.  I'll be wondering why a class isn't adding and removing and keep trying things until i realize I had a period in there
[18:36:29] <abjorn> I like how Wil Wheaton and Levar Burton follow each other on Twitter.
[18:39:51] <thinkster> I noticed some jquery plugins for image editing, anyone know of hand if there is anything out there that can allow you to create and edit text boxes on an image inside a web page browser window?
[18:42:04] <vindice> thinkster: what exactly you trying to do?
[18:43:01] <vindice> thinkster: you want text displayed over an image?
[18:43:07] <thinkster> Well, I have a jpg, it is posted on a webpage.  I want a visitor to be able to do image editing on the jpg.  Not all the fancy stuff that inkscape or gimp does, just add text box, move it around, resize, maybe add shadow and glow if possible
[18:43:24] <thinkster> vindice, not displayed, I want the actually image to be edited
[18:43:49] <thinkster> vindice, I saw one plugin, it allows you to resize and stuff
[18:44:31] <vindice> thinkster: you can't do that with html4 / javascript
[18:44:51] <vindice> thinkster: you could look into the canvas element of html5
[18:45:11] <thinkster> well, say you have a button, that runs an image magik command and edits the image and refreshs the page
[18:45:15] <vindice> you can create graphics and export as image files with canvas and javascript
[18:45:36] <thinkster> canvas?
[18:45:45] <vindice> ah so you want to edit the image on the server, and the updated image displays in the browser
[18:46:19] <thinkster> yeah, basically, an online image editor.  They have them, but I am just looking for a simple one, just for editing text over the image
[18:46:58] <vindice> You could script imagemagik from the webserver
[18:47:23] <vindice> not sure you can add textboxes.
[18:47:31] <thinkster> vindice, you think that would be the easiest option
[18:47:48] <vindice> depends on your coding experience
[18:48:04] <vindice> If you can find an off-the-shelf solution obviously that'll be easier
[18:48:17] <thinkster> I know you can add text over images from the command line using image magic, but I don't think coding controls on the web page  that connect to image magik commands is easy.  Thats basically starting from scratch
[18:48:37] <thinkster> vindice, yeah, off the shelf would be the best hehe
[18:49:43] <vindice> thinkster: yep making it yourself is more complex obviously, but if imagemagik can do what you want, then all you'd need is a bit of ajax to call webservices which themselves run imagemagik and return the url of the updated image.
[18:50:30] <vindice> thinkster: you could probably do it with flash too
[18:50:46] <thinkster> vindice, no, I don't think going that route is in the realm of my abilities.  But I a doing a search "web image edit api" I will let you know what I find
[18:51:29] <thinkster> vindice, thanks.  you gonna be here in a bit, I will be googling for a bit, ttyl hopefully
[18:52:18] <vindice> thinkster: don't know if this helps: http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas2image/
[18:52:22] <thinkster> There are a lot of api out there, sumo, picnic,
[18:52:33] <vindice> sweet
[18:53:01] <thinkster> vindice, looks promising
[18:53:16] <thinkster> vindice, well, I want to find one that is opensource though
[18:53:23] <vindice> canvas is open source
[18:53:30] <vindice> it's part of the html 5 standard
[18:53:44] <thinkster> yeah, I am checking it out, except, I don't think IE8 supports html5 yet
[18:53:50] <vindice> only trouble is that only certain browser support it
[18:53:55] <vindice> right
[18:54:09] <thinkster> tons of ppl still use windows XP which has at most IE 8
[18:55:50] <thinkster> Ajax-Image Editor is popular. Another one is Pixastic.
[19:00:44] <lazyPower> I really, really wish people would just catch a clue and use something other than IE
[19:00:54] <lazyPower> and I know i'm not alone in that wish
[19:01:37] <thinkster> yeah, they its very wierd situation.
[19:01:50] <thinkster> MS has so much resources and yet is lacking so much
[19:02:39] <Prometheus> www.ie6countdown.com
[19:02:45] <Prometheus> least they are trying to advocate something =)
[19:02:51] <thinkster> I hear its a mess over there, its like a bunch of competing companies(departments) withing the company.  No continuity
[19:03:36] <thinkster> And Bill Gates is not part of anything technical, he is just Business man.  He calls tech support himself
[19:07:36] <thinkster> I think imagemagik is the best way to go, but I will have to learn a new langauge it seems, like Perl or php or python
[19:07:50] <thinkster> http://www.imagemagick.org/script/api.php#php
[19:08:28] <thinkster> I wanna do this in a day or it isn't worth it for me
[19:09:15] <vindice> thinkster: I don't think you'll do it in a day if you don't have experience with php/perl/python etc
[19:09:26] <vindice> personally I'd suggest using ruby on rails
[19:09:38] <vindice> I don't know much about rails itself but I love ruby
[19:09:40] <thinkster> true, but then, at least today, I wil be able to add text
[19:09:44] <vindice> everyone seems to love rails
[19:10:50] <thinkster> vindice, that link I mentioned, thats what I am looking for right.  I mean, that api will allow me to include image editing in a website page, or will the website page integration aspect be whole separate problem
[19:12:04] <thinkster> I think php will be the easiest to use, but there are three, and the php channel is always full
[19:12:08] <vindice> thinkster: just clicked it. Looks good. Don't go for perl, it'll almost certainly be of limited use to you in the guture
[19:12:42] <vindice> php is ugly as sin but there's a lot of info around on it.
[19:12:49] <abjorn> uhhh and the girl caress me down, uhhhh and thats the lovin sound, uhhh and the girl caress me down, thats the lovin sound
[19:13:00] <abjorn> php has been bastardized :<
[19:13:06] <abjorn> with the tacked on OOP
[19:13:30] <thinkster> I was thinking php would easy, cause I just apt-get install it on the server, but I don't know how to install the extension, it must be same thing
[19:14:22] <vindice> thinkster: php is easy to get going on ubuntu. apt-get intsall php-5 I think
[19:14:36] <abjorn> yeah
[19:14:45] <abjorn> You don't need the -5 part, though
[19:14:51] <vindice> thinkster: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP#Troubleshooting PHP 5
[19:14:54] <abjorn> should give you the latest with just apt-get install php
[19:14:59] <thinkster> yeah, true, I need to install the extension too
[19:15:40] <vindice> obviously you don't need to worry about MySQL on that link
[19:16:02] <abjorn> If you don't have experience with php or anything you could always use node :3
[19:16:13] <thinkster> vindice, I have php installed, it was easy, just apt-get install php5 did it, and then you make test page to see if it iinstalled.
[19:16:17] <vindice> really don't think node is the solution here
[19:16:40] <abjorn> haha well it *could* be
[19:16:41] <abjorn> but
[19:16:41] <vindice> I using it for a content management system for a client. I like it though. CMS isn't really what it's designed for either!
[19:16:43] <abjorn> not really
[19:16:48] <thinkster> Now I have to chose from three different php imagemagick solutions
[19:17:14] <abjorn> magickwand i think is what's usually used
[19:19:17] <thinkster> there is also IMagick  phMagick
[19:20:00] <thinkster> I will go with magickwand since abjorn recommends
[19:20:51] <vindice> thinkster: I know nothing of it. I've heard IMagik being liked. I suggest at least check their wikipedia pages first
[19:21:15] <vindice> don't want to go down a more difficult path for 2 hours only to find out you made the wrong choice at the start
[19:22:16] <abjorn> yeah I wouldn't say I recommend it exactly
[19:22:18] <thinkster> vindice, well, they are both natively supported, the third phMagick is just a wrapper class, whatever that means.  But I guess the natively supported ones will be easier to get going
[19:22:20] <abjorn> I'm not a php developer lol
[19:22:24] <abjorn> but I've heard of it
[19:22:38] <thinkster> abjorn, hehe, yeah, but you mentioned it, and so like a toss of the coin
[19:22:51] <abjorn> Just thought I'd say "Hey, I've heard of this one" :P
[19:23:09] <thinkster> abjorn, having heard of it is plus for me
[19:23:18] <vindice> thinkster: wrapper just means you call a class method and it calls the corresponding imagemagik function
[19:23:31] <vindice> *and that calls....
[19:24:16] <thinkster> hmm, native extension sounds like it will easier to use than a wrapper class.  As a guess
[19:25:12] <vindice> thinkster: http://php.net/manual/en/book.imagick.php
[19:25:35] <thinkster> oh awesome, thanks
[19:26:45] <vindice> just clicked the introduction link on the top of the page. Seems to be exactly what you want
[19:27:03] <vindice> anyways I gotta work. Good luck
[19:28:20] <thinkster> thanks, good days sire

[19:47:57] <lazyPower> djQuery: you around?
[19:55:37] <southof40> In http://jsfiddle.net/q8JcQ/1/ can anyone tell me what form the data returned by "editController/loadContents" should be to allow the .html to populate the form correctly ?
[19:57:16] <milardovich> Hello guys. I have a problem. I have two divs, with 2 different margins but the same width, and I want to know if there is a collision between them(I mean, if one div is over the other)
[19:57:21] <milardovich> Is that possible with jquery?
[19:59:02] <milardovich> http://pastebin.com/TuaqcXGG <-- here there is an example of what I need
[20:01:07] <abjorn> milardovich: No, jQuery can't do that, but I suppose there may be a plugin that can
[20:01:44] <milardovich> abjorn: do you know any?
[20:01:52] <abjorn> No, sorry :(
[20:03:04] <kborchers> milardovich: check out http://vidasp.net/tinydemos/javascript-detect-overlapping.html and view the page source. might get you on the right track
[20:04:00] <milardovich> let's see
[20:10:19] <aaairc> hey guys. I'm trying to do something like this:  http://tashian.com/carl/archives/treemap-sf.jpg
[20:10:47] <aaairc> is there a plugin i should start with. its to create an image treemap where the images are sized according to popularity
[20:11:25] <darcyclarke> aaairc isotope
[20:11:36] <darcyclarke> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
[20:11:36] <Techdeck> gotta love ipad and their friggin auto play restriction
[20:11:38] <Techdeck> may they burn in hell
[20:14:06] <aaairc> darcyclarke: would isotope resize my images on the fly?
[20:14:20] <aaairc> or do i need to do that ahead of time or something?
[20:14:38] <darcyclarke> aaairc you'd need to do that before hand
[20:15:03] <coreyo> is there a way to check if a css class has been defined?
[20:15:08] <darcyclarke> you could technically change their dimensions on the fly and it should still work as long as you tell it to recalculate
[20:15:26] <systemfault> coreyo: On a node?
[20:15:32] <systemfault> coreyo: hasClass
[20:15:36] <darcyclarke> coreyo do you mean "hasClas()"
[20:15:37] <darcyclarke> ;)
[20:15:44] <darcyclarke> hasClass*
[20:15:45] <coreyo> systemfault, no, I want to know if the class has been defined, not if it has been added
[20:15:53] <darcyclarke> ...
[20:16:16] <aaairc> darcyclarke: do you have a suggestion for how to do that image resizing? the thing is that i want the image size to be kinda dynamic... so if someone goes to the site, and votes for an image, it would be great to see that image get slightly larger within the treemap as it is now slightly more popular
[20:16:18] <coreyo> so I'm creating a plugin that will style itself, only if an external stylesheet does not already define one of its default classes
[20:16:18] <systemfault> coreyo: Nobody sane cares about that :(
[20:16:29] <systemfault> Ah ok.
[20:17:06] <coreyo> basically, I want a table to set itself up and style itself, but be overridable by an external stylesheet.  Is there an easy way to tell if a css classname has already been defined?
[20:17:19] <systemfault> coreyo: You're probably going to use pure DOM to iterate through the rules of every stylesheet...
[20:17:34] <systemfault> coreyo: Do you understand how CSS works?
[20:17:49] <kborchers> aaairc: check out http://getjqueryplugins.com/jsquares-an-image-collage-like-the-ted-com.html. that seems to do what you want. a little rough but a good start
[20:17:53] <darcyclarke> aaairc if you want that in realtime your going to need to do something with like sockets or long polling or something ajaxy unless you only care about the one to one user to site aspect of that experience... you can technically do what you want, and again, I'd use isotope to do all the grid layout work (which would be the hardest part of that)
[20:18:18] <systemfault> If you add another stylesheet after the first one, it's going to override the default rules
[20:19:01] <coreyo> systemfault, it's true, I might be going about it the wrong way.  Basically, I want to create a plugin that has default styles for its elements, but that can be overriden by external CSS classes
[20:19:14] <systemfault> coreyo: Then don't do anything.
[20:19:34] <systemfault> coreyo: Just give the possibility to the user of your plugin to add a class to the plugin
[20:19:47] <systemfault> coreyo: Like for example jQuery UI Dialog.
[20:19:59] <systemfault> It has a "dialogClass" parameter
[20:20:03] <coreyo> so the idea is to check something like if (!classExists(".FooStyle")) { element.css('add', 'defaultvalues'); }
[20:20:28] <systemfault> You're creating a problem that doesn't exists.
[20:21:26] <coreyo> systemfault, well the idea is to have a default look and feel with 0 configuration
[20:21:33] <coreyo> including 0 external stylesheets
[20:21:44] <systemfault> coreyo: Then you're doing it wrong.
[20:21:55] <systemfault> It's not javascript's business to deal with styling.
[20:22:19] <aaairc> darcyclarke: your saying i would need to do something with sockets, long polling or ajaxy if i want the size to grow without a reload of the page? meaning it would grow for that person and potentially for everyone else that is looking at the page? i guess i'm trying to understand what you mean when you say if i only care about the one to one experience
[20:23:06] <coreyo> systemfault, at this point, you're arguing philosophy, not functionality
[20:23:24] <systemfault> It's not philosophy.
[20:23:45] <systemfault> If you want to botch your job, it's your thing.
[20:23:58] <darcyclarke> aaairc yea, I thought you were going after something that was dynamic in the sense that other people could be voting and it would effect my view as well
[20:24:39] <darcyclarke> aaairc either way, you should be good to go with that plugin I gave you and some custom js / css to handle the growth when a user votes
[20:25:15] <coreyo> systemfault, exactly! so the question remains, is there a way using javascript or jquery to determine if a css class with a particular name has been defined?
[20:25:47] <aaairc> darcyclarke: ok great. yeah having it dynamic like that would be awesome.
[20:25:51] <aaairc> kborchers: thanks for the link. that looks kinda like what i want to do. the only thing may be with this... at least as its shown in the demo, every image has the same aspect ratio. i was hoping to do it with images that would each have different aspect ratios... haven't fully thought out the implications of that yet though
[20:26:13] <systemfault> coreyo: Try to find a plugin to play with stylesheets or write your own.
[20:26:26] <kborchers> aaairc: yeah, that makes it more fun ;)
[20:26:33] <systemfault> coreyo: How are you going to style your widget without a stylesheet?
[20:26:33] <kborchers> ?hasClass @ coreyo
[20:26:34] <bot-t> coreyo, .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[20:26:37] <jrockjiggz> does anyone have a basic tutorial fo rnew jqxhr object? i can't wrap my head around the deferred object and its use with .then() .when() etc...
[20:27:02] <kborchers> coreyo: but as systemfault said, you should not be including css in your js!
[20:29:25] <darcyclarke> jrockjiggz http://vimeo.com/22687950
[20:29:44] <darcyclarke> danheberdens jQConf talk on Deferreds is great
[20:30:12] <aaairc> darcyclarke: with isotope would that display nicely on an ipad / mobile device too... does it provide support for something like that?
[20:30:26] <darcyclarke> aaairc yes sir
[20:30:41] <aaairc> darcyclarke: awesome
[20:30:45] <darcyclarke> css3 animations, so gpu magic
[20:30:48] <darcyclarke> nice and fast
[20:30:57] <darcyclarke> recommended by paul_irish himself ;)
[20:31:39] <coreyo> so assuming that the css class "foo" has never been defined in any stylesheet, if I create an element <element id="foo" class="foo"> and call $("#foo").hasClass("foo"), will it return true or false?
[20:32:06] <darcyclarke> true
[20:32:42] <coreyo> then this does not help me.  Is there any way to tell if the css class "foo" has been defined in the current context?
[20:33:27] <darcyclarke> why do you need that?
[20:33:36] <misterm> coreyo: out of curiousity, why do you need that?
[20:34:03] <systemfault> Only by playing with stylesheets directly.. Iterate through all stylesheets... through every rule and check of the class exists with some regex.
[20:34:08] <systemfault> It's just stupid.
[20:34:46] <darcyclarke> coreyo I don't see why you need to check if a style hasn't been "defined" ....
[20:36:05] <coreyo> I'm doing some prototyping and I'd like to set some defaults programmatically
[20:38:06] <misterm> coreyo: isn't the whole idea of defaults, that they are..default? Why not just set them and then they can be over-ridden if needed?
[20:38:07] <darcyclarke> ....still don't understand what you're trying to achieve, you should know whether or not you've defined styles JS doesn't provide you with a list of all classes / ids
[20:39:16] <coreyo> misterm, that's the idea, I just want to be able to override them with  CSS file, not by passing a mess of options to the plugin itself
[20:39:34] <systemfault> coreyo: You should learn CSS :
[20:39:36] <systemfault> :(
[20:39:40] <systemfault> It will help a lot.
[20:39:46] <misterm> coreyo: and what's stopping you from doing that?
[20:44:04] <coreyo> listen, I am well aware of the issues with design philosophies here, and I'm not looking for a lecture, I'm just looking for a simple answer.  If the answer is no, then say so.  If there is a way to do it, then I will handle any and all responsibility for bad design philosophies and it will not be your fault.
[20:44:33] <misterm> it's hard to help without understanding precisely what your problem is
[20:45:15] <misterm> Often times people do not really need what they thing they need...I'm pretty sure your direct question was answered, it's just a question of seeing if theres another way of accomplishing your goal
[20:50:47] <coreyo> Well basically, I've got some quick and dirty plugins that I want to have some simple CSS layout directives with 0 configuration upon initialization.  0 configuration includes no external CSS.  After the initial functionality testing, I will be adding stylesheets once I start worrying more about appearances.  For now, I just want to define some internal CSS for specific tags within the base element in the absence of a css file that defines those classes.  I
[20:50:47] <coreyo> n the end, this will all be overhauled.
[20:50:51] <t2gs> hey guys, can anyone recommend a free webchat widged solution to put on a website? flash, iframe, whatever
[20:53:57] <coreyo> the idea for now is just to add something like "if (!classIsDefined("foo") { $("#elementFoo").css('float', 'right'); }  etc.
[20:54:27] <misterm> coreyo: yea, but why not just set the defaults, and let them be over-written as they may?
[20:56:07] <misterm> coreyo: you say you don't want styles to start with, ok...leave it unstyled...then when you're ready add the default styles...before any logic that would add any other styles. Or maybe what you want is a special debug mode with it's own styles, in which case I would probably add some sort of switch somewhere to turn it on and off
[20:56:45] <systemfault> That "all or nothing" approach is bad...
[20:57:04] <systemfault> What if the user likes most of the style but want to change just a small thing?
[20:57:08] <coreyo> misterm, having a  no-external-styles option is certainly a viable approach
[20:57:34] <coreyo> systemfault, as for your last question, what I'm proposing would do exactly that
[20:58:10] <coreyo> if you wanted to change just one thing, you'd just define that one css class
[20:58:35] <systemfault> coreyo: You don't understand how CSS works.
[20:59:00] <coreyo> systemfault, perhaps
[20:59:08] <systemfault> There's no perhaps..
[20:59:12] <misterm> coreyo: ok, in your example...you are checking if "foo" is defined....what would be defining foo?
[20:59:34] <coreyo> misterm, an externally linked CSS file, or inline CSS defined somewhere in the HTML
[20:59:55] <coreyo> .foo { }
[21:00:00] <misterm> ok, and who would be doing that?
[21:01:18] <coreyo> whoever implemented the page that uses the plugin
[21:02:12] <misterm> ok, so basically what you do is just set your default styles, and let the user worry about over-riding that
[21:02:25] <coreyo> misterm, right
[21:02:47] <misterm> so either, you just stick your styles in a style-sheet, the user includes that and over-rides it if need be
[21:03:05] <misterm> or if you need to include the styles dynamically, have the user provide their custom styles as an argument to the plugin
[21:03:16] <misterm> and then you just load their custom styles at whatever point is appropriate
[21:03:26] <misterm> how you do that depends on precisely what you want to do
[21:04:35] <coreyo> misterm, well for the original test package, I just wanted to include a plugin that didn't also require a default stylesheet to be distributed with it
[21:05:08] <misterm> coreyo: why not?
[21:06:03] <coreyo> more to deal with and maintain for the initial testing, that's all
[21:06:16] <misterm> coreyo: but either way, it seems to me is that all that matters is whether the user has custom styles they want to use or not
[21:06:58] <misterm> and that information is not hard to get, if you even need it
[21:09:22] <coreyo> misterm, for now, no, but eventually yes.  The idea was to wrap the default style settings in "if" statements for now then override little bits as needed for the initial testing.
[21:09:27] <coreyo> simplify the tester's job
[21:09:35] <FuzzyNuts> 2 quick questions
[21:09:42] <systemfault> coreyo: You're making it more difficult.
[21:09:53] <systemfault> coreyo: Because your plugin doesn't work like the rest.
[21:10:03] <FuzzyNuts> Could someone tell me how I can make a link fade in/out of a colour on mouseover?
[21:10:29] <misterm> coreyo: yea, but why wrap it in an if? and in what way does it make the testing easier if you do?
[21:10:34] <FuzzyNuts> And I wanted to know if this is correct: http://pastebin.com/razy2Vgm
[21:10:52] <misterm> it shouldn't matter if a particular class is set...if it is you just over-ride it
[21:11:57] <coreyo> misterm, well what I"m trying to do is test if the class is defined.  If it is, I don't want to override it.
[21:12:06] <coreyo> FuzzyNuts, you might check out the jqueryUI "pulsate" effect
[21:12:21] <coreyo> http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect
[21:12:25] <misterm> coreyo: ok well who is defining the class you don't want to over-write?
[21:12:41] <misterm> coreyo: what it comes down to is have the user style your plugin in the same way you do it
[21:12:53] <misterm> if you're styling it with a stylesheet, then have them include that an theirs after
[21:13:17] <misterm> if you're styling it dynamically, allow them to provide their styles in whatever form and then add theirs after you do yours
[21:13:29] <FuzzyNuts> coreyo: I mean like when the mouse is on it, it fades to a colour, then when the mouse moves away, fades out
[21:13:43] <misterm> be it a stylesheet, an object containing the values, a string of flags...whatever form you want
[21:14:21] <coreyo> FuzzyNuts, there are bunches of animation types, perhaps the "Color Animation" ?  http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/
[21:14:45] <coreyo> FuzzyNuts, call the animate functions on mouse over and on blur?
[21:15:27] <FuzzyNuts> Thanks
[21:15:38] <coreyo> FuzzyNuts, np
[21:16:43] <coreyo> misterm, I follow you, the idea was just to give the guys a single plugin file that they could test and that did most of the work for them.
[21:17:21] <misterm> coreyo: sure, and if thats what you want I dont see why you couldn't do that, though I think you overestimate the clutter of the simple way
[21:17:38] <coreyo> misterm, yes, that may be the case
[21:18:03] <coreyo> misterm, the idea, as is often the case, is not to make my life simpler, but to make the customer's life simpler
[21:18:59] <misterm> sure, but Im pretty sure you can have both
[21:19:26] <coreyo> so I never did get a direct answer.  If the answer is "no, you cannot check whether a style has been defined", then the point is moot anyway
[21:19:50] <misterm> well you can get what you want, just not in the way you were trying to do it
[21:20:18] <RobW> does anyone know of a plugin to rotate thumbnail pictures on mouseover? kind of like porn sites do lul
[21:20:41] <coreyo> misterm, so then the answer is simply "no" ?
[21:21:01] <misterm> coreyo: no to what?
[21:21:24] <misterm> coreyo: there's ways you can try to sniff out what styles are defined, but for the problem you describe there's absolutely no reason to
[21:21:29] <RobW> for example, 3 images: http://img.youtube.com/vi/5P6UU6m3cqk/1 TO 3.jpg...
[21:21:36] <RobW> I want to rotate all 3 images on mouseover
[21:21:54] <RobW> show 1.jpg for 1 second, 2.jpg for 1 second, 3.jpg for one second and repeat
[21:22:03] <coreyo> misterm, so then how do you go about 'sniffing' out what styles are defined?
[21:22:28] <misterm> coreyo: well its sort of moot, because you don't need to...
[21:23:06] <misterm> but if you scroll back, systemfault was talking about it earlier...or if you know what the styles might be you can check for them
[21:24:12] <coreyo> misterm, are you referring to a trick where you set an arbitrary value for an arbitrary attribute then check to see if that attribute == the arbitrary value?
[21:24:46] <misterm> coreyo: but there's no reason to, you can distribute your plugin as a single file, and then if the user wants custom styles they can put it in a stylesheet and do myPLugin.customStyles("foobar.css")
[21:25:15] <coreyo> misterm, understood, and duly noted
[21:26:15] <misterm> though I'd say that's needlessly complex to avoid the "hassle" of including a separate css file
[21:26:44] <misterm> but yea, basically if you know what the style will change, you can check and see if it's been changed, and infer from that
[21:26:54] <misterm> I don't think that applies to your case though
[21:28:25] <coreyo> misterm, yeah, I came across that solution and, as you said, it ads just as much complication because it still requires external, arbitrary CSS directives.
[21:28:56] <coreyo> aside from being twice as hacky as what I had in mind
[21:29:23] <misterm> coreyo: which solution do you mean?
[21:29:54] <coreyo> well the only way that I saw was to do something like
[21:29:57] <Chibby_> does anyone know if it's possible to do the 2nd example here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#option-text but vertical instead of horizontal?
[21:30:42] <coreyo> .foo { width: 215321px }     ... then check to see if the width attribute = 21532px .  If so, then it hadn't been overriden, and the style hadn't been defined.
[21:30:57] <Chibby_> ah looks like you can't do it natively
[21:32:17] <misterm> coreyo: yea, something like that...it's not something that's easy to do because there's not a whole lot of use for it
[21:36:21] <coreyo> systemfault,  misterm, I appreciate the information and the explanations.  I just don't like it when I have philosophy shoved down my throat.  An straightup answer, maybe followed by an explantion is always better.  I think that if there was a proper way to do what I wanted, it'd be worth doing at this stage of the testing.  Since there is not, as you said, it's more trouble than it's worth.
[21:36:59] <misterm> coreyo: there's no philosophy, you simply don't need to do what you're trying to do, even if you could do it, it'd be the wrong way to go about it
[21:37:04] <coreyo> But I can make that decision myself once I know the details, and avoid most of the discussion that was had.
[21:37:20] <coreyo> "wrong way" = design philosophy
[21:37:50] <misterm> I would say doing a bunch of extra work for absolutely no reason would be considered "wrong" for most people
[21:38:05] <coldhead> lol
[21:38:12] <misterm> styles will automatically over-write eachother, there's absolutely no reason to write  a bunch of "if" statements
[21:38:13] <coreyo> misterm, sure, but you're not giving me the chance to make that decision myself
[21:38:28] <misterm> simply apply the styles in the proper order of precedence
[21:38:30] <FuzzyNuts> The code I've tried isn't workin
[21:38:35] <FuzzyNuts> Am I missing something?
[21:38:36] <FuzzyNuts> http://pastebin.com/rXfsEQCt
[21:38:40] <misterm> perhaps, but I would consider that a favor
[21:39:23] <coreyo> misterm, and there is always an exception to every design philosophy rule
[21:39:34] <coreyo> just as there is always an exception to every rule
[21:39:55] <misterm> coreyo: I suppose, but we don't have one heree
[21:40:44] <coreyo> misterm, so here's a legitimate question based on what you're saying
[21:42:17] <coreyo> ("#myelement").MyPlugin()   ... suppose that this initializes my plugin and, in the process, grabs many of the internal elements and calls element.css('attribute', 'value'); on them.
[21:42:41] <coreyo> you're saying that the CSS loaded before the call will override them, or doe the CSS files have to be loaded after the initialization calls?
[21:43:15] <FuzzyNuts> Is anybody able to help with my query
[21:43:17] <misterm> coreyo: what Im saying is, in whatever way you do your own styling, have the user supply their custom styles in a compatible manner
[21:44:31] <systemfault> coreyo: Using .css == fucking up styling with stylesheets.
[21:44:42] <misterm> coreyo: That seems the most common sense and easiest way to handle it
[21:45:12] <misterm> coreyo: so if you are styling your plugin with myplugin.css, then the user can style it with their own stylesheet
[21:45:26] <misterm> That's the simplest way and how many plugins handle it
[21:45:43] <misterm> if you are styling your plugin dynamically, then have the users supply their styles as an argument
[21:45:57] <coldhead> it's best to avoid styles all together, really
[21:45:58] <misterm> the form of the argument is up to you, the URL to a stylesheet, a string, an object
[21:46:07] <coldhead> black text on a white background
[21:46:10] <coldhead> links in blue
[21:46:18] <coldhead> that's how the web is supposed to look
[21:46:27] <djQuery> coldhead: no white text on white background
[21:46:40] <coldhead> i have to select the text to read it then
[21:46:47] <coldhead> and it selects with pink for some reason
[21:46:55] * coldhead glares at paul_irish
[21:47:08] <misterm> lol
[21:47:36] <coreyo> systemfault, exactly why I was hoping to test in the code itself so that the .css() calls don't override previously defined styles.  I seriously understand what you're saying, I promise you, but I'd rather have the facts an make my own decision rather than having you cram it down my throat without explaining why.
[21:47:42] * misterm forks html5 boilerplate to fix crummy pink
[21:47:45] <coreyo> coldhead, I think that's how ascii pr0n was born
[21:47:50] <Chibby_> does anyone know of a good example bit of jquery that will pop up a small information div next to the mouse when you hover on something?
[21:47:59] <Chibby_> i was looking at one yesterday and lost it s:
[21:48:00] <systemfault> I think we should go back to using the gopher:// protocol
[21:48:08] <systemfault> HTTP is for noobs!
[21:48:16] <djQuery> coreyo: then go read the spec instead
[21:48:29] <coreyo>  /me googles gopher://
[21:48:44] <djQuery> Chibby_: ?see qtip
[21:49:01] <djQuery> dang it see ?qtipe
[21:49:02] <bot-t1> djQuery, qTip - The jQuery tooltip plugin - Home - http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/
[21:49:10] <coreyo> systemfault, exactly how old are you?
[21:49:10] <djQuery> damn i cant type
[21:49:34] <systemfault> coreyo: 28 3/4
[21:49:51] <Chibby_> thanks!
[21:49:56] <coreyo> so you were gophering like the E-Trade baby?
[21:50:15] <systemfault> Nah, I never actually used gopher :P Except for fun..
[21:50:29] <systemfault> (Firefox supported gopher until Firefox4 )
[21:50:55] <coreyo> misterm, it's getting late and I'm going to go kill some zombies before bed.  Thanks for your patience and explanations.
[21:51:08] <systemfault> coreyo: With plants?
[21:51:13] <misterm> np, good luck with your plugin
[21:51:18] <djQuery> coreyo: l4d2/
[21:51:21] <coreyo> systemfault, no, but I did do that this morning
[21:51:32] <systemfault> plants vs zombies == fun :P
[21:52:05] <coreyo> systemfault, still trying to find a way to farm gold and finish buying the upgrades, but it seems that they hacked the daisies on the android version so that they share a global cooldown :(
[21:52:39] <systemfault> coreyo: Ah :P
[21:52:44] <coreyo> set up a map with a last zombie standing that I could keep alive indefinitely, then filled up the board with coin-producing daisies and some magnets
[21:52:56] <coreyo> but 30 daises produced as many coins as 3 daisies :(
[21:53:04] <systemfault> coreyo: Yeah, same of iphone
[21:53:17] <coreyo> l4m3
[21:53:22] <systemfault> I found a not bad way...
[21:53:58] <coreyo> I chose the "dead nation" freebie after my psn identity was hacked, so I've been playing that with random people online.
[21:54:37] <coreyo> I am the king of strafing and charged rifle shot
[21:54:42] <systemfault> :)
[21:57:04] <coreyo> djQuery, one of my buddies keeps telling me to get l4d2.  I must admit that eating brains sounds like fun.
[21:57:40] <coreyo> alright, thanks all, I must take my leave.
[22:09:52] <FuzzyNuts> Can anyone help me with this code?
[22:09:52] <FuzzyNuts> http://pastebin.com/rXfsEQCt
[22:10:00] <FuzzyNuts> None of it is working :/
[22:12:42] <atula> FuzzyNuts: you meant to use .hover ?
[22:12:50] <FuzzyNuts> huh?
[22:13:16] <FuzzyNuts> Dammit, I changed it to mouseover after the first time
[22:13:17] <FuzzyNuts> XD
[22:13:43] <FuzzyNuts> Still doesn't work anyway
[22:13:44] <atula> FuzzyNuts: but there are a few things in your codes that tell me you're not completely get what document ready wrapping function
[22:13:56] <atula> FuzzyNuts: may I offer some small suggestions?
[22:14:13] <FuzzyNuts> Sure
[22:14:49] <atula> one thing at a time first, okay. let's get your hover/mouse over thing working
[22:14:55] <FuzzyNuts> Ok
[22:16:39] <atula> FuzzyNuts: stay put, I am working on a small prototype to demostrate
[22:16:45] <FuzzyNuts> Ok
[22:20:28] <Noob_Soup> Hi all! anyone know of a script to parse textarea input to a string of img tags? (i need to show how the users input will look as if it were printed on the actual product, I have pics of each character)
[22:20:56] <Noob_Soup> I have it kind of working, but figured I was re-inventing the wheel...
[22:23:16] <eponym> Noob_Soup: not sure offhand but I might take the textarea string and run a regex over it for img tags.
[22:23:46] <atula> FuzzyNuts: you can't animate the background color... that's one thing...
[22:23:57] <atula> what you CAN do though is animate its opacity
[22:24:15] <FuzzyNuts> Ah right
[22:24:32] <atula> but there are a few issue in your jquery codes thinking
[22:24:36] <FuzzyNuts> Can I not make it fade into a colour when the mouse is hovering on it?
[22:24:44] <atula> have you done javascript/jquery before?
[22:24:47] <FuzzyNuts> No
[22:24:52] <atula> I figure
[22:25:08] <Noob_Soup> eponym: I have the string parsed into characters, but the filenames can not differentiate between upper and lower case. I.e. A.jpg and a.jpg arn't read as two different files...
[22:25:08] <atula> as I said before... natively you can't do something like that
[22:25:16] <atula> you can do something like fadein/fadeout
[22:25:23] <atula> opacity wise
[22:25:45] <jessicaf> hi can someone please help me with this code . please have a look at it .. it doesnt pop up the alert message box http://pastebin.com/V71ZX4H1
[22:27:10] <eponym> Noob_Soup: I'm not sure what you mean.
[22:27:12] <jessicaf> am i doing something wrong?
[22:27:26] <jessicaf> do you see alert(1); in the jquery code
[22:27:38] <jessicaf> suppose to pop up a message box right ? but it doesnt do anything when i submit the form
[22:27:56] <eponym> jessicaf: try lower case alert(1)
[22:28:35] <jessicaf> i did
[22:28:50] <jessicaf> it still dont
[22:28:52] <atula> FuzzyNuts: would a small example like this demonstrate the jquery issue you're having ? http://jsfiddle.net/kN8yg/
[22:29:06] <Noob_Soup> eponym: when I type the letter A (upper case) in my textarea, it succesfully puts img A.jpg where I want it... But I can't upload a.jpg (lowercase 'a'') to the server, it wan'ts to overide the cap version (A.jpg)
[22:29:41] <Noob_Soup> so my 'basic' text-to-image  won't work with upper and lower case letters...
[22:29:42] <atula> FuzzyNuts: obviously, for a simple hover like this, I would just rely on css and a:hover element... but I just wanted to show you the jquery $(document).ready( thing
[22:30:16] <jessicaf> am i doing anything wrong  ?
[22:31:26] <FuzzyNuts> atula, I wanted a fade effect
[22:31:42] <Noob_Soup> I thought there might be a 'text-to-ascii' script or something of the like, that does something like this (takes text input and converts it to use an array of images instead of text characters
[22:32:06] <FuzzyNuts> Didn't meant to make it sound rude :/
[22:32:23] <atula> FuzzyNuts: you can with a few tricks: animate opacity of position fixed item or use one of the plugins (I think!)
[22:32:44] <eponym> Noob_Soup: why don't you just convert everything to lowercase?
[22:32:46] <shaggy_> Anyone able to help me with an Internet Explorer compatability problem? I'm not exactly sure if it's jquery or not
[22:32:59] <jessicaf> guys you need to help me out with this
[22:33:05] <atula> FuzzyNuts: but before getting to that, I wanted to make sure that you understand jquery abit more.. or it will be hell trying to help you or help you help yourself once you start working on the fading part
[22:33:06] <jessicaf> is it the browser or my pc got a virus or what
[22:33:13] <Noob_Soup> eponym: because I need to show the actual upper and lower case letters...
[22:33:19] <atula> FuzzyNuts: just wanted to give you the most help I can before I get back to my own work
[22:33:20] <jessicaf> i dont think i am doing anything wrong ..can someone test this script for me and tell me about it please
[22:33:22] <jessicaf> http://pastebin.com/V71ZX4H1
[22:34:22] <atula> FuzzyNuts: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/808790/jquery-fade-background-on-hover perhaps this will help you get things done quickly without going deeper
[22:34:47] <atula> but read a bit more or whatever route you take... you'll run into quite a bit of headache
[22:37:27] <shaggy_> anyone able to help me?
[22:37:51] <atula> shaggy_: it's probably more helpful to you to just ask the question straight out, my friend
[22:38:41] <shaggy_> Anyone able to help me with an Internet Explorer compatability problem? I'm not exactly sure if it's jquery or not
[22:38:59] <atula> ?ask
[22:38:59] <bot-t1> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[22:39:22] <atula> shaggy_: ^
[22:42:17] <shaggy_> Sorry atula. I'm having compatibility issues with internet explorer. Basically it's a web IRC client which after you enter a captch connects you (automatically) to irc (through a timer). Works fine on Chrome and FF,
[22:43:25] <shaggy_> I'm a bit lost as to where to start in terms on makng it work with IE... It also uses mootools so it could be a motools problem, not jquery. http://paysnork.com/index.php (if you wanted to see what I'm talking bout)
[22:45:24] <atula> shaggy_: which version of IE ?
[22:45:30] <atula> I only have 7 so I'll test with that
[22:47:09] <atula> shaggy_: on IE7.. I can log into the IRC service after captcha ... but it looks terrible
[22:47:22] <shaggy_> I tested on IE8
[22:47:27] <atula> which I suspect: 1) malform html and 2) css issue
[22:47:29] <atula> for now
[22:48:05] <atula> if you rely heavily on javascript to do your layout... then 1) lint your javascript 2) validate your html codes
[22:48:13] <shaggy_> Yeah I know it looks like ASS ( I need to fix that up, eventually. But I just want to get the main functionallity working again
[22:48:29] <atula> shaggy_: I'm on IE7 and it works for me
[22:48:34] <atula> I was able to log onto the clien t
[22:48:50] <atula> did you try jslint your javascript perhaps ?
[22:49:29] <shaggy_> How do I "jslint"? That will be a good start, I think. Thank you
[22:49:52] <atula> shaggy_: http://jslint.com/ paste your javascript in there and cry
[22:49:53] <atula> :D
[22:50:23] <shaggy_> Oh lord ok
[22:50:35] <dr0id> how about jsfiddle.net ?
[22:50:56] <Prometheus> screw jslint
[22:51:00] <Prometheus> jshint is good enough =)
[22:51:04] <atula> :)
[22:51:50] <atula> jslint is pretty tough.. which I like... I generally don't take ALL the suggestions.. kike I'll continue to do condition && execute();
[22:51:57] <atula> jslint doesn't like that though
[23:02:04] <shaggy_> Can I just paste the html source in or do I have to go and get all the js?
[23:19:13] <eponym> I'm planning out a single page app I want to build, but it's going to be a little bit complex and I want the page to dynamically swap in some different full-screen views. Is there a good template framework or something I should check out for laying these out and swapping them?
[23:19:36] <djQuery> ?see ui.tmpl
[23:19:58] <djQuery> eponym: see ?ui.tmpl
[23:20:03] <abjorn> holla holla get $
[23:22:49] <eponym> djQuery: What am I looking at?
[23:23:12] <djQuery> http://www.borismoore.com/2011/04/jquery-bay-area-conference-presentation.html
[23:23:48] <djQuery> atula: if it hurts then dont do that
[23:23:58] <eponym> Thanks.
[23:24:04] <atula> djQuery: ?
[23:24:27] <jessicaf> hi djquery
[23:24:32] <djQuery> hey
[23:24:59] <jessicaf> can you help me with this code http://pastebin.com/V71ZX4H1
[23:25:03] <jessicaf> i cant figure out what i am doing wrong
[23:25:39] <djQuery> jessicaf: hve you looked at ?g malsup form
[23:25:46] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[23:25:46] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 28 minutes and 59 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Read error: Connection reset by peer
[23:25:55] <djQuery> damn lazy bot
[23:25:56] <dr0id> .seen bot-t
[23:25:56] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 29 minutes and 9 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Read error: Connection reset by peer
[23:25:59] <jessicaf> no i thought of learning the basics first
[23:26:12] <coldhead> Alert() should be alert()
[23:26:29] <jessicaf> but then still it doesnt work
[23:26:32] <coldhead> you can't skip parameters with ,, you need to use , undefined,
[23:26:41] <coldhead> or , null,
[23:26:54] <djQuery> and you wanna look at event.preventDefault() else you are just gona keep submitin
[23:27:02] <coldhead> or maybe you don't even need ,, at all, it should be ,
[23:27:06] <jessicaf> when i use the parameters it doesnt pass the parameters to php.php
[23:27:45] <coldhead> try ,  {}, function () { etc
[23:27:54] <coldhead> and when that is working you can add more to the {}
[23:27:54] <Skval> if you would like to pass parameters to the php file you should pass it in the url.
[23:28:00] <Skval> e.g: php.php?param1=1
[23:28:15] <coldhead> that is the worst way to do it, Skval !
[23:28:26] <coldhead> building your own query strings is for cavemen
[23:28:32] <coldhead> and cavewomen
[23:28:54] <coldhead> you should leave jQuery to pass your params for you
[23:29:15] <jessicaf> not my php file is <?php print_r($_POST); ?>
[23:29:18] <djQuery> jessicaf: have you looked at $(this).serialize()      $.post('php.php', $(this).serialize(), function(){});
[23:29:31] <jessicaf> thats the content of my php.php file
[23:29:44] <jessicaf> it should show the list of parameters i am passing to php.php
[23:30:02] <jessicaf> yes i did djquery
[23:30:10] <jessicaf> but thats not what i am looking to sort out right now
[23:30:12] <coldhead> the code you have pasted won't pass anything to php.php because it has a syntax error
[23:30:32] <jessicaf> holy shet
[23:30:45] <jessicaf> dam it
[23:30:46] <jessicaf> okay
[23:30:48] <coldhead> programming is hard :(
[23:30:55] * ejo visualizes a turd with a halo
[23:30:58] <Prometheus> =/
[23:31:03] <Prometheus> programming is becoming hardness
[23:31:13] <coldhead> YOU TERRIBLE PERSON EJO <3
[23:36:25] <ltackett> I'm having a weird problem jQuery.ui.dialog issue. I have some wide tabular content I'm putting in a dialog. When I get the expected vertical scrollbars in the dialog, it scrolls all chunky and slow.
[23:37:08] <jessicaf> whats the syntax error ?
[23:37:17] <ltackett> no error, it's just slow as hell
[23:37:26] <acidjazz> new cmoputer
[23:37:29] <acidjazz> problm solved
[23:37:35] <ltackett> heh,
[23:37:45] <jessicaf> not you
[23:38:01] <jessicaf> coldhead whats the syntax error in my php file
[23:38:06] <ltackett> oh, dur,
[23:39:05] <coldhead> in the javascript, jessicaf
[23:39:19] <jessicaf> coldhead can you please point out where the error lies
[23:39:19] <coldhead> the ,, i keep mentioning
[23:39:29] <coldhead> and the Alert that should be alert
[23:39:33] <ejo> jessicaf: change it so it sends all of the $.post() parameters by name, not by position.
[23:39:35] <jessicaf> yes i corrected it
[23:39:49] <coldhead> ?p @ jessicaf
[23:39:49] <bot-t> jessicaf, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[23:40:02] <coldhead> show us what you have now so we know what you're talking about
[23:40:30] <jessicaf> okay
[23:40:32] <djQuery> jessicaf: and that jslint button in jsfiddle will catch those syntax errors a lot better than some paste site
[23:40:40] <ltackett> jsfiddle with my slow scrolling: http://jsfiddle.net/vhsFK/ though it doesn't seem to suffer the same problem when isolated..
[23:42:10] <djQuery> ltackett: takes a sec to parse but then it scrolls fine
[23:45:22] <jessicaf> here this is what i got http://jsfiddle.net/qCVAr/2/
[23:46:57] <jessicaf> hello?
[23:47:50] <djQuery> jessicaf: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/qCVAr/3/
[23:49:34] <coldhead> lol hello
[23:50:02] <djQuery> spelled propogation wrong http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/qCVAr/4/ jessicaf ^^
[23:50:05] <jessicaf> that didnt do anything djquery
[23:50:18] <jessicaf> okay
[23:50:44] <djQuery> jessicaf: without that in there even if php returns what u are looking for you will never see
[23:50:46] <djQuery> it
[23:52:16] <jessicaf> still does nothing djquery
[23:52:35] <jessicaf> i tried your code and it doesnt do anything when i submit the form
[23:52:51] <djQuery> dont know php that good
[23:53:04] <djQuery> coldhead: ^^^^^
[23:53:30] <jessicaf> its just one line of php code in php.php file <?php 	print_r($_POST); ?>
[23:54:03] <coldhead> how dare you accuse me of knowing PHP
[23:54:32] <djQuery> but from looking at the network level in chrome it looks fine. it sent search: gfgg in the  data
[23:54:40] <coldhead> jessicaf: try adding some placeholder data to your PHP so you can see if ANYTHING is coming back
[23:54:44] <coldhead> like
[23:55:05] <coldhead> lololo<?php print_r($_POST); ?>lolololol
[23:55:24] <coldhead> then you can see if you're at least getting the lols back from the server
[23:56:07] <coldhead> and then you;ll want to check firebug or the chrome web inspector to see what data is going back and forth
[23:56:26] <coldhead> don't give up! you can't be far off, jessicaf
[23:57:04] <jessicaf> no i dont get anything
[23:57:13] <jessicaf> back
[23:57:17] <jessicaf> from the php file
[23:57:47] <coldhead> that might not be jQuery's problem
[23:57:48] <coldhead> >: \
[23:58:14] <coldhead> try changing print_r($_POST) to print_r($_GET)
[23:58:25] <coldhead> and then try visiting the page in your browser with a GET string
[23:58:35] <djQuery> or both
[23:58:43] <coldhead> so like whatever.com/php.php?LOL=LOLOADIS
