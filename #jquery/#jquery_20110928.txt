[00:11:37] <Spadeski> Do i need the .min.js if i have the jquery.s file ?
[00:12:39] <ravenzz> Spadeski they are the same library, the .min.js one is the minified one
[00:12:51] <ravenzz> a packed version
[00:12:55] <Spadeski> oh
[00:13:07] <Spadeski> well i have two diffones i think there messing with eachother
[00:14:50] <Spadeski> Can someone tell me if tehre messing witheachother
[00:16:24] <ravenzz> what?
[00:16:49] <ravenzz> just use the minified one, and be sure to include the last version
[00:18:40] <Spadeski> i tried but then some of my code doesntwork
[00:20:13] <[I]Leonidas> I've been tuning my autocompletion but I ran into a bit of trouble: http://jsfiddle.net/nqK9s/
[00:20:32] <[I]Leonidas> when I navigate the results by keyboard, the input field shows the values instead of the labels
[00:21:17] <Eviltwin> Is this a bug? http://api.jquery.com/jsonp/
[00:25:44] <Bower^> Looks like it Eviltwin
[00:36:14] <juha_> coldhead: you crazy austrian rapper, you should move to finland and we could eat delicious cake together
[00:36:44] <KarateKip3> why is it that .hide() in Internet Explorer 9 works okay but in Firefox 6.0.2 DOES hide the DIV, but leaves a big blank space? Shouldn't it shift everything up just like in IE ?
[00:45:01] <Spadeski> Depnds on if your hiding thediv or the html inside ?
[00:46:19] <KarateKip3> Spadeski: no, i'm hiding the entire div like this $("nameOfDiv").hide();
[00:46:31] <Spadeski> ah yeah that is wierd
[00:48:14] <iszak> Morning #jquery
[00:56:10] <soc42> hi #jquery
[00:56:13] <soc42> i am looking for a way to integrate jquery development in eclipse
[00:56:34] <soc42> and to enable auto-complete for jquery/js libraries
[00:57:42] <soc42> everything is working, but there seems to be some functions missing in the latest jquery 1.64 library
[00:58:34] <liam> I want to make a feature where I can drag a div from a parent page onto an iframe and identify the element in the iframe that the div has been dragged on to. Ive started using draggable which allows me to drag the div over the iframe but I am not sure on how I can get the position and element etc. Any ideas?
[00:58:54] <soc42> is there something like a "full library version" for development or do i have to add each special library functions one by one as single js files?
[01:10:32] <coldhead> thank god you're here aaronmcadam
[01:10:40] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[01:10:53] <iszak> yes, what would we do without you aaronmcadam.
[01:10:58] <coldhead> exactly
[01:11:18] <coldhead> the shining beacon of patient reason
[01:11:48] <aaronmcadam> sarcy pricks
[01:12:15] <troubleman> now now
[01:12:26] <aaronmcadam> i'm not serious
[01:12:33] <coldhead> i am serious
[01:12:39] <troubleman> yall take things too seriously
[01:12:42] <troubleman> like its a gamble
[01:12:50] <aaronmcadam> yeah it is
[01:12:56] <troubleman> in that case
[01:12:59] <troubleman> cherish each moment
[01:12:59] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with ye coldhead
[01:13:11] <coldhead> if you don't take things seriously you end up with 4 or 5 wives you lightheartedly married
[01:13:23] <troubleman> in islam thats a good thing
[01:13:33] <aaronmcadam> hahah
[01:13:34] <coldhead> islam is pretty serious
[01:13:35] <aaronmcadam> who cares
[01:13:39] <troubleman> rather than having a new sexual partner every weekend - stick to 4, and treat them all equally
[01:13:49] <aaronmcadam> you don't need religion to "cherish" life
[01:13:55] <coldhead> it helps
[01:14:01] <troubleman> islam isnt really a religion, its a way of life
[01:14:02] <coldhead> cherish it or suffer damnation!
[01:14:08] <coldhead> I'M CHERISHING AS FAST AS I CAN GOD
[01:14:09] <troubleman> christianity is a religion, unfortunately islam has been put in the same category
[01:14:27] <troubleman> its also been put in the same category as "dictatorial regimes" and "dubious cultural practices"
[01:14:30] <coldhead> now look, i just wanted to talk polygamy and you had to drag religion into it
[01:14:38] <aaronmcadam> did you have a question then or were you trolling me coldhead
[01:14:56] <coldhead> i have people asking questions i can't answer
[01:15:07] <coldhead> and that department is one of your specialities, aaronmcadam
[01:15:12] <troubleman> coldhead: you ok with polygamy?
[01:15:23] <coldhead> i'm okay with whatever i can get away with
[01:15:26] <troubleman> cause i could always use a new wife for my stable
[01:15:31] <coldhead> which isn't much with 7 wives har har har
[01:16:22] <troubleman> troubleman
[01:16:28] <troubleman> troubleman to men, superman to women
[01:16:29] <soc42> is there a jquery jsdoc version?
[01:16:37] <troubleman> looking for a good wife, w.i.f.e = washing, ironing, fucking etc.
[01:16:56] <troubleman> (for my new luxury home in dubai)
[01:17:01] <coldhead> that's too far, troubleman
[01:17:06] <[I]Leonidas> any chance on getting some help here instead of having to listen to racism and sexism?
[01:17:09] <troubleman> i already got a wife in my home in norway
[01:17:34] <aaronmcadam> haha
[01:17:40] <coldhead> ask and ye shall receive, [I]Leonidas
[01:17:48] <coldhead> subject to availability
[01:17:59] <aaronmcadam> but wait there's more
[01:18:05] <[I]Leonidas> [09:20] <[I]Leonidas> I've been tuning my autocompletion but I ran into a bit of trouble: http://jsfiddle.net/nqK9s/
[01:18:05] <[I]Leonidas> [09:20] <[I]Leonidas> when I navigate the results by keyboard, the input field shows the values instead of the labels
[01:18:06] <aaronmcadam> buy now in 3 easy payments
[01:18:28] <aaronmcadam> what autocompletion
[01:18:46] <[I]Leonidas> the jqueryui feature
[01:19:02] <aaronmcadam> kk
[01:20:49] <liam> I want to make a feature where I can drag a div from a parent page onto an iframe and identify the element in the iframe that the div has been dragged on to. Ive started using draggable which allows me to drag the div over the iframe but I am not sure on how I can get the position and element etc. Any ideas?
[01:21:08] <juha_> howdy
[01:21:43] <coldhead> cake you say, juha_
[01:21:47] <coldhead> i've heard of that
[01:22:06] <blackspotwiggins> [I]Leonidas, return false from the autocomplete select event
[01:22:44] <blackspotwiggins> ah, sry you already do that
[01:22:58] <blackspotwiggins> maybe focus then
[01:23:14] <[I]Leonidas> hmm, hang on, I'll try it now
[01:23:54] <[I]Leonidas> great, thanks! hadn't thought of that
[01:24:01] <johnywp> hello all
[01:24:10] <johnywp> is anyone familiar with noConflict()?
[01:24:40] <quicksilver> yes. Lots of people are familiar with it. Do you have a question? :)
[01:25:38] <johnywp> i do... :)
[01:25:59] <johnywp> i used var j123 = jQuery.noConflict();
[01:26:12] <johnywp> and replaced a few $ with j123
[01:26:17] <johnywp> and they all seem to work
[01:26:18] <blackspotwiggins> osnap, could it be you are using 1.2.3 ?
[01:26:24] <johnywp> nope
[01:26:28] <johnywp> 1.4.4
[01:26:35] <blackspotwiggins> ok, not that bad then
[01:26:42] <johnywp> actually... it's very bad
[01:26:51] <johnywp> I am doing it in order to load 2 jquery versions :S
[01:27:00] <blackspotwiggins> most people do
[01:27:04] <johnywp> lol ok
[01:27:14] <johnywp> so, I used j123 and it worked
[01:27:17] <blackspotwiggins> but at least you are doing with 2 year old version, not 4(or was it 5) ?
[01:27:42] <johnywp> but now I installed a plugin which uses jQuery(..... and it doesn't seem to work
[01:27:58] <johnywp> if I remove the noConflict and loading the old version, it works fine
[01:28:11] <coldhead> blackspotwiggins, aaronmcadam: you guys are the a-team
[01:28:12] <juha_> coldhead: yes, cake made out of polar bears and iglus
[01:28:12] <quicksilver> well you need to decide which version you want to be 'jQuery' and which one you don't
[01:28:19] <coldhead> i carry drinks for the d-team
[01:28:20] <quicksilver> and you need to use noConflict(true)
[01:28:20] <coldhead> :(
[01:28:26] <quicksilver> on the one that isn't going to be jQuery
[01:28:30] <coldhead> igloos*
[01:28:34] <quicksilver> but really, using two vresions of jQ at once is unpleasant.
[01:28:43] <johnywp> ohh... so var j123 = jQuery.noConflict(true); ?
[01:29:13] <johnywp> i want to use j123( for the old version, and jQuery( for the new version
[01:29:37] <aaronmcadam> removeAllA Boolean indicating whether to remove all jQuery variables from the global scope (including jQuery itself).
[01:30:08] <aaronmcadam> if you pass true, you'll destroy the jQuery reference
[01:30:32] <Spadeski> Hey http://gotactics.net/?gp=music on the right there is a two music blocks when you onhover it shows content but repositions it ?
[01:30:58] <juha_> coldhead: in finland, we don't have the letter o, especially we don't have the double o, so it's impossible for us to spell "oo"
[01:30:58] <juha_> coldhead: we are a poor soviet country
[01:31:01] <johnywp> hmmm
[01:31:05] <johnywp> so, how would it work
[01:31:07] <quicksilver> load old one first, then do var j123 = jQuery.noConflict(true);, then load new one, which should take the jQuery variable.
[01:31:56] <johnywp> so, i would ALSO do var jQuery = jQuery.noConflict(); after loading the new one? or loading the new one would do that automatically?
[01:32:27] <coldhead> lol juha_
[01:33:10] <juha_> coldhead: the o's on these messages are borrowed from sweden
[01:33:16] <blackspotwiggins> haha
[01:33:22] <fRAiLtY-> Hi guys can anyone tell me why here: http://www.blumarks-print.co.uk/ my slider is hidden almost? It's sliding in the background but not really visible :x
[01:33:32] <coldhead> in finland, yuu dun't have the letter o, especially you dun't have the double o, su it's impussible for you to spell "oo"
[01:33:35] <coldhead> i understand
[01:33:46] <johnywp> that doesn't seem to work - unless if i do need to add a var for the new one
[01:33:48] <juha_> coldhead: they are going to chop my hands off, but just to let you guys know that finland is a poor soviet country, it's totally worth it
[01:34:52] <johnywp> actually... the new jquery that I am loading comes with jQuery.noConflict(); at the end
[01:35:01] <johnywp> is this what's breaking it?
[01:36:19] <Spadeski> Hey http://gotactics.net/?gp=music on the right there is a two music blocks when you onhover it shows content but repositions it ?
[01:38:40] <johnywp> the weird thing is that this is only a problem when it comes to IE
[01:38:47] <johnywp> firefox and chrome seem to work
[01:38:56] <johnywp> but what would be the right way to use it
[01:39:19] <brianpWins> How can I inspect all functions currently binder to a selector?
[01:39:25] <brianpWins> or object
[01:39:55] <johnywp> load the old version with var j123 = jQuery.noConflict(true); and then simply load the new version after that? doing so would make the new version automatically adapt to jQuery( or would I have to set another noConflict?
[01:42:07] <jmvelasco> hello, I need to paginate results into a simplemodal jaquery plugin, anybody has experience with htat ?
[01:42:42] <jmvelasco> I lose the identifiers I set to my layers when the content is displayed into the simeplmodal, so I can't control the table
[01:43:18] <jmvelasco> when I use the href, the simeplmodal is no longer opened, so the results are shown outside the simplemodal box ...

[02:21:20] <dddbmt> Hi guys. I am trying to do a cross-domain ajax call with jquery. I've posted my code+error message here: http://pastebin.com/ZdsCKfmp
[02:21:58] <blackspotwiggins> you cant do crossdomain requests unless the server sets correct headers
[02:22:07] <blackspotwiggins> could have at leasted googled the error message
[02:22:19] <b0red> does jquery's find take an XPath string?\
[02:22:26] <b0red> i.e. $(xmlDoc).find("//station[@id=" + $(this).attr('station') + '"]/name').each(function()
[02:22:37] <blackspotwiggins> b0red, not anymore
[02:22:50] <dddbmt> blackspotwiggins, the server is sending Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[02:23:00] <dddbmt> to asterix (*)
[02:23:01] <blackspotwiggins> dddbmt, obviously it doesnt..
[02:23:14] <b0red> blackspotwiggins, any alternative?\
[02:23:22] <blackspotwiggins> fix your header
[02:23:24] <dddbmt> blackspotwiggins, does my code look correct? Am I using the "beforeSend" corretx?
[02:23:48] <blackspotwiggins> dddbmt, do you understand the difference between the BROWSER and the SERVER
[02:24:15] <dddbmt> yes I do
[02:24:34] <blackspotwiggins> the server needs to set the headers.
[02:24:36] <blackspotwiggins> not the browser.
[02:24:38] <dddbmt> it does.
[02:25:12] <dddbmt> blackspotwiggins, the allow-control-request header I'm sending is just a desperate try to get it to work....
[02:25:56] <blackspotwiggins> what's the url
[02:34:03] <poppiez> I'm trying out the HTML5 boilerplate build script. do you guys know if you can exclude the default.root.script for certain pages? there are some cases where you don't want to include the default script for custom pages
[02:36:02] <ravenzz> #html5 ?
[02:37:11] <poppiez> ravenzz: it's extremely slow in there :)
[02:38:05] <ravenzz> I don't have the answer sorry :[
[02:38:27] <ravenzz> tweet them? google?
[02:39:55] <aloiscochard> hello all
[02:40:57] <aloiscochard> any idea why "$('input[name=select]')" and "$('input:checked')" works OK ... but "$('input[name=select]:checked") won't ??
[02:42:15] <ravenzz> which type of input would you select?
[02:42:28] <aloiscochard> ravenzz: it's checkboxes
[02:42:36] <logik-bomb> $('my a element').how_do_I_query_its_class?
[02:43:00] <aloiscochard> ravenzz: in <tr> <td>
[02:44:36] <logik-bomb> .attr('class')
[02:44:37] <logik-bomb> :X
[02:45:02] <ravenzz> aloiscochard it works http://jsfiddle.net/z3SGm/
[02:45:51] <aloiscochard> ravenzz: perhaps a matter of adding double quote, will give a try, ty
[02:46:11] <ravenzz> aloiscochard and this is for multiple results http://jsfiddle.net/z3SGm/1/
[02:46:30] <MACscr> so i have a large image file with multiple images within it, im going to put it as a background for a div. Any recommendations how i can change the background position on page refresh? that way i can show a random image on each page. Im thinking i could use jquery to cycle through the background positions, which would be 78px height change each time, but then a max of 1112px. Any recommendations?
[02:47:57] <aloiscochard> ravenzz: yep I actually use foreach, testing rightnow with doublequote
[02:48:28] <amitev> hi guys
[02:49:46] <amitev> i perform an ajax request using jQuery.ajax(). However the request is not sent to the url i'm passing it but to the current url (i see this on firebug) and beforeSend and success handlers don't get called
[02:50:00] <amitev> idea what i'm doing wrong?
[02:51:31] <aloiscochard> ravenzz: well it don't work dude -> http://jsfiddle.net/z3SGm/2/
[02:51:39] <aloiscochard> ravenzz: you forget adding one without the same name
[02:51:54] <aloiscochard> ravenzz: the one with other name should not be populated in for loop
[02:52:21] <aloiscochard> aaahhh
[02:52:27] <aloiscochard> was missing console
[02:52:30] <aloiscochard> sorry, let me retry
[02:52:59] <aloiscochard> yeah it work forget that ravenzz
[02:57:13] <aloiscochard> thanks a lot ravenzz, bye all
[03:07:44] <ravenzz> MACscr div { background:transparent (imgs.png) no-repeat left top }
[03:11:15] <Layke> Are there any tooltips plugins that will create a tooltip, without using the "title" attribute?
[03:11:21] <Layke> I'd like to be able to pass it the tip to use.
[03:11:47] <ravenzz> $(document).ready(function() { var imgsNo = 10; var rand=Math.floor(Math.random(1,imagesNo)*10); $('div').css('background-position', 'left '+rand+'px' });
[03:18:52] <MACscr> ravenzz: hmm, let me dissect that. thanks
[03:20:50] <ravenzz> MACscr it's wrong
[03:20:53] <ravenzz> hold on
[03:21:51] <MACscr> ravenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/4Er7A/7/ thats a js only way that someone suggested, but its not working
[03:21:53] <ravenzz> MACscr can you provide me your img url?
[03:21:58] <MACscr> but gives you an idea of what im trying to do
[03:22:18] <MACscr> basically trying to load a complete row from the image on each page load
[03:24:28] <MACscr> jquery makes much more sense than just js though imho =P
[03:24:46] <MACscr> especially since im already using jquery on the site
[03:26:07] <ravenzz> MACscr yep that's correct
[03:26:25] <ravenzz> maybe you should add the correct height to pos
[03:26:48] <ravenzz> probably it isn't 80px but a few less
[03:27:16] <red> to store an element in variable I use var foo = $('#element'); -- how do I save $('#element').parents().eq(2) and then further targeting with div[id$="bar"], do i use find() or is there something with better performance?
[03:27:23] <MACscr> yeah, im going to get the graphic designer to fix the image to make it exact, im just making the code for now. Obviously the numbers can easily be changed
[03:27:41] <ravenzz> so you want a random row?
[03:27:43] <ravenzz> as bg
[03:28:02] <MACscr> doesnt have to be random, just needs to move a row on each page load
[03:28:15] <leelu> Hi, I am using wdcalendar, I want to increase the height of the event rows in this calendar ? Have checked the jquery.calendar.js but not sure where to have this change done
[03:28:30] <ravenzz> so what's wrong with your code?
[03:29:19] <MACscr> jhttp://jsfiddle.net/4Er7A/9/
[03:29:21] <ravenzz> MACscr do you really need to store the current vertical position?
[03:29:32] <MACscr> no, random is fine
[03:29:36] <MACscr> just needs to be different
[03:30:12] <amitev> i perform an ajax request using jQuery.ajax(). However the request is not sent to the url i'm passing it but to the current url (i see this on firebug) and beforeSend and success handlers don't get called. if i set a "pure" ajax request with javascript (without jquer) the reqeust is performed properly. idea what i'm doing wrong?
[03:30:23] <MACscr> so that last jsfiddle works, but not with IE7, etc, which i would need it to work that way.
[03:31:00] <ravenzz> ok because it doesn't support localstorage
[03:31:17] <MACscr> right
[03:32:41] <Ron7bg> hey guys, I've been struggling .... and I need a PRO to enlighten me on what I am missing
[03:33:16] <Ron7bg> http://www.legzskin.com/fr/products.php?product=LONU-BLEU  == zoom works only on the first image...
[03:33:52] <coldhead> i wish i could help, Ron7bg, but it's my first day using jQUery lol
[03:34:08] <Ron7bg> if I enable an option alwaysOn, it works for all the images, but I need this big image not to be always on....
[03:34:23] <Ron7bg> coldhead: I was refering to PROs :)
[03:38:40] <ravenzz> i am back
[03:38:43] <ravenzz> MACscr http://jsfiddle.net/DYzPy/
[03:39:02] <Ron7bg> anyone?
[03:39:45] <MACscr> ravenzz: thanks!
[03:40:20] <b0red> is there a reference to the .find() method of XMLDocument?  i want to see what it returns ..
[03:47:35] <Ron7bg> so noone here is able to help on the zoom?
[03:50:22] <red> simple stuff, but can't wrap my head around it: http://jsfiddle.net/HQKht/
[03:54:47] <JamesTaylor> hi all, i'm trying to display a "loading gif" when my jqueryui autocomplete is searching, for some reason it is not firing, my style sheet has this line : .ui-autocomplete-loading { background: white url('images/loading.gif') right center no-repeat; } is there anything else i need to do ?
[03:55:35] <iaincarsberg> hey, is there a away to monitor appends to a div, like $('#some-div').live('appended', function () {}); ?
[03:56:42] <b0red> how can i query the map element whose attribute channel=2?
[04:09:14] <ryrych> hi
[04:09:41] <ryrych> http://jsfiddle.net/v9kL3/ Why can’t propagation be stopped immediately?
[04:10:30] <sean`> ryrych, what doesn't stop?
[04:10:37] <gnarf> ryrych: what do you think stopImmediatePropagation does?
[04:10:39] <sean`> mouseup adn click event aren't attached to each other
[04:10:49] <sean`> propagation only goes for the same event
[04:10:56] <gnarf> if you want mouseup to stop the click, try preventing the default
[04:11:40] <sean`> doesn't work either gnarf
[04:12:47] <ryrych> gnarf: yeah, it doesn't work
[04:13:15] <ryrych> sean`: so what is the best solution to stop click from triggering?
[04:13:53] <sean`> set a dirty flag
[04:13:58] <sean`> or change your binds
[04:14:28] <sean`> why are you even binding a click if its not executed
[04:14:51] <sean`> I can only assume that you have some kind of expression that decides to fire a click or not
[04:15:06] <sean`> Unless we gt info about it, we can't help with structuring
[04:21:10] <ryrych> sean`: rrh.vot.pl/chemtrails (kinda conspiracy theory ;), open the second link – it’s an image, press Z, hold your mouse while being on the left side, press Z again but do not release mouse; and then mouse up
[04:28:48] <ablomen> http://www.itulip.com/images/tinfoilhat300.jpg
[04:30:12] <ablomen> ryanseddon, anyway, why not set a variable on click and unset it on release, and use an if loop in whatever other callbacks you use?
[04:30:25] <ablomen> woops, that was for ryrych
[04:31:22] <GeO`> hey
[04:31:39] <GeO`> how can I get the event when there's a click on a scrollbar ,
[04:31:40] <GeO`> ?
[04:31:50] <GeO`> it doesn't fire click()
[04:35:40] <Trisox> ? .scroll
[04:35:41] <bot-t> .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[04:36:02] <Trisox> GeO`
[04:36:36] <GeO`> well the thing is, I'm using animate({scrolltop:...   on this element too
[04:36:47] <GeO`> and my goal is to actually stop() the animation if the user takes the control himself
[04:37:19] <GeO`> so binding stop() to scroll() would make the animation stop instantaneously
[04:38:13] <GeO`> or I would need to say to animate() not to trigger the scroll event...
[04:38:59] <GeO`> do you get my issue Trisox ?
[04:39:07] <Trisox> mm no idea you could catch the scroll so from there you could stop your scrolling might be able to catch the height your in in the document now
[04:39:08] <Trisox> or something
[04:44:08] <aaronmcadam> ?darn you and your darn limitations
[04:44:08] <bot-t> Stop talking to me that way, I'm a lady, goddamnit!
[04:46:28] <Ron7bg> http://www.legzskin.com/fr/products.php?product=LONU-BLEU  == zoom works only on the first image... can you please help??? I cannot figure this out for 2 days now
[04:49:39] <Falcon`> hey folks
[04:49:49] <Falcon`> i've one question about UI sortable lists
[04:50:06] <Falcon`> i've got two lists connected with each other, one contains files, 2nd folders
[04:50:20] <Falcon`> how to prevent folder list from accepting files? but not vice versa
[04:53:42] <Trisox> Falcon`: try http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#option-disabled
[04:56:07] <Falcon`> i was talking about sortables, not draggables
[04:56:21] <Falcon`> also, wouldn't that just disable whole behavior?
[05:02:29] <Falcon`> oh
[05:02:31] <Falcon`> i've got it
[05:02:36] <Falcon`> items option did the job
[05:02:42] <Falcon`> thanks for help anyway
[05:23:26] <jeffsmykil> Is there a way to use .pop() to remove a specific value in an array, or can it only remove the last value?
[05:24:02] <fatninja> I have a div with class 'article' i've done this in jquery $(this).addClass("article_mouseover"); ( on mouseover event ) and in that specific class I've changed some borders and some margins, but it doesn't seem to have any effect.
[05:24:37] <jak> jeffsmykil: check out splice()
[05:24:50] <fatninja> In the same selection if I change the css $(this).css("border-top-right-style","none"); or whatever it works
[05:25:51] <jeffsmykil> jak so myArraySplice(foo, 0);
[05:26:00] <jeffsmykil> jak: would remove foo from the array?
[05:29:13] <jak> myArray.splice(foo, 0);
[05:29:33] <jeffsmykil> yeah, ok cool
[05:29:35] <jeffsmykil> ty
[05:29:54] <jak> or (foo, 1).. i dont remember the syntax perfectly :)
[05:30:02] <fatninja> Ok, problem solved.
[05:30:47] <jak> jeffsmykil.. looked it up.. the syntax is splice(index, howmany), so you need to find the index first
[05:30:53] <jak> see http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_splice.asp
[05:30:57] <jeffsmykil> jak curses
[05:32:33] <jeffsmykil> jak is there a super easy way to do that or do i need to use a for loop
[05:32:44] <jak> jeffsmykil, not so bad, its just myArray.splice(myArray.indexOf(foo), 1)
[05:32:58] <jeffsmykil> oh jquery adds an indexOf?
[05:35:32] <jak> huh appparently not
[05:35:37] <jeffsmykil> lol
[05:35:56] <jak> jeffsmykil.. myArray.splice(jQuery.inArray(foo,myArray), 1) !
[05:36:50] <jeffsmykil> what is the 1 for?
[05:37:00] <jak> to remove 1 item
[05:37:17] <jeffsmykil> and it knows to remove foo?
[05:37:43] <jak> inArray returns an index position
[05:37:47] <jak> ?inArray
[05:37:48] <bot-t> jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[05:38:03] <jeffsmykil> I think inArray returns a true or false?
[05:38:36] <skamikaze> no it acts like indexOf
[05:38:40] <jeffsmykil> kk
[05:38:43] <jeffsmykil> ty
[05:38:45] <skamikaze> (it uses indexOf if available)
[05:39:13] <jeffsmykil> here it says it returns 0 or -1
[05:39:20] <skamikaze> jeffsmykil: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=inArray
[05:39:33] <gnarf> -1 means its not there
[05:39:37] <gnarf> 0 means its at index 1
[05:39:43] <gnarf> 1 means its at index 1
[05:39:47] <jeffsmykil> ahhh
[05:39:51] <gnarf> 0 / 0 (damn typos)
[05:39:56] <skamikaze> :)
[05:40:27] <gnarf> whats the objective tho?
[05:41:29] <whateverb> how can I get the right selectors for my sum function? http://jsbin.com/ekefuv/edit#javascript,html
[05:41:34] <jeffsmykil> finding if an object has a certain value in an array and removing it
[05:43:09] <blackspotwiggins> whateverb, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter

[05:44:45] <bot-t> gnarf: No output. (Process Killed)
[05:45:07] <JD-Robbs> Does anyone know if there are any hooks in the Media plugin for operations such as play(), pause(), stop and getposition()?
[05:45:30] <whateverb> thanks, blackspotwiggins, its hard to understand it, but I will try
[05:45:55] <gnarf> ?js var a = [ { test: 1 }, {test: 2}, {test:3} ], i = a.length, o;  while( i>0 ) { o=a[ --i ]; if ( o && o.test == 2) { a.splice( i, 1 ); } } console.log( a );
[05:45:57] <bot-t> gnarf: [{"test": 1}, {"test": 3}]
[05:46:09] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: ^^
[05:46:45] * jeffsmykil tries to clear the cobwebs
[05:47:19] <gnarf> start at the last item, check each item for the match ( o.test == 2 ) and remove it a.splice( i, 1 );
[05:47:22] <jeffsmykil> you dont use inarray
[05:47:30] <aaronmcadam> it's not an array
[05:47:33] <aaronmcadam> it's an obj literal
[05:47:43] <gnarf> oh thats even easier
[05:47:46] <blackspotwiggins> ?js var a = [ { test: 1 }, {test: 2}, {test:3} ]; a.filter(function(other) { return other.test !== 2 });
[05:47:47] <bot-t> blackspotwiggins: [{"test": 1}, {"test": 3}]
[05:48:11] <gnarf> blackspotwiggins: wee filter
[05:48:19] <jeffsmykil> man i feel stupid, im just going to play with it for a while
[05:48:23] <gnarf> wish it worked everywhere
[05:48:26] <blackspotwiggins> well
[05:48:27] <blackspotwiggins> fuck ie8

[05:48:34] <david_bru> good day. i have currently a question concerning draggable and droppable. i'm right now in the process of creating a little drag and drop game: http://test.eigenart.co.at/ama_spiele/1/01_2/
[05:48:38] <david_bru> i have 3 draggable items and 3 dropzones. every draggable item is allowed on every dropzone - i was able to do that. no drop zone should take more than one draggable item - i was also able to do that. you should be able to put the draggable items back out of the dropzones - was also able to do that.
[05:48:42] <blackspotwiggins> thats why i linked underscore#without
[05:48:45] <david_bru> i just don't know how to find out which draggable item is currently dragged..
[05:48:54] <david_bru> any ideas on that?
[05:49:10] <david_bru> or how to find out wether a drop zone has currently a draggable object dropped on it..
[05:49:31] <gnarf> ?js var a = [ { test: 1 }, {test: 2}, {test:3} ]; $(a).map( function() { return this.test !== 2 ? this : null; }).get();
[05:49:31] <bot-t> gnarf: [{"test": 1}, {"test": 3}]
[05:50:23] <gnarf> david_bru: look at the "ui" param to the event
[05:50:30] <whateverb> I want to get sum of every row right, how? http://jsbin.com/ekefuv/edit#javascript,html
[05:50:32] <gnarf> i think ui.item might be the dragable
[05:51:26] <gnarf> whateverb: you got a few problems there
[05:51:27] <gnarf> first off
[05:52:08] <gnarf> you are looking for like all prices, not nearby ones...
[05:52:52] <whateverb> i want to look for the same row price and unit
[05:53:09] <whateverb> and multiple them
[05:53:30] <david_bru> gnarf: if i output ui.item while dragging or on start it just outputs undefined..
[05:54:00] <kitikonti> why this dont work http://jsfiddle.net/sWuPb/
[05:55:13] <gnarf> whateverb: http://jsbin.com/ekefuv/2/edit
[05:55:20] <joso> hello there, is there a selector that goes from child to ancestor... for example in from <div class"rabbit"> be able to get a parent <class="mammal"> which is parent of <div class="lagomorph">
[05:55:52] <joso> shit my explanation sucked... sorry
[05:56:38] <whateverb> thanks, gnarf...i will learn from it
[05:57:06] <dmnc> hi folx!
[05:58:10] <gnarf> whateverb: bonus round: http://jsbin.com/ekefuv/3/edit

[05:59:55] <gnarf> yay jsfiddle

[06:02:52] <kitikonti> why this dont work http://jsfiddle.net/sWuPb/
[06:04:00] <whateverb> thanks :)
[06:05:00] <darcyclarke> kitikonti http://jsfiddle.net/darcyclarke/sWuPb/1/
[06:05:16] <darcyclarke> you used "else if" instead of just "else"
[06:05:45] <darcyclarke> if you're going to want to use an "else if()" you must provide a condition
[06:07:10] <kitikonti> darcyclarke: ahhh my fault
[06:07:29] <biscazziere> hi, I'm trying to use :eq() to get the first child of .request with class .message: http://jsfiddle.net/tys6v/
[06:07:54] <biscazziere> this way is not working, I want a red border around "First message a" and "Second message a"
[06:08:44] <biscazziere> it seems that :eq has grater precedence respect to the parent - child portion of the selector
[06:09:09] <jak> biscazziere http://jsfiddle.net/tys6v/1/
[06:10:18] <biscazziere> jak: thanks, but I need to get only the div.message which are inside a div.request, and also in arbitrary position (like second for example)
[06:10:56] <biscazziere> is there a way to use only selectors, without resorting to methods like .children() or .find() ?
[06:12:36] <jak> not in the way you want it. you need find. just use :eq instead of :first for arbitrary position, just like you had
[06:13:23] <biscazziere> jak: ok thanks
[06:13:46] <jak> the selector '.request .message' returns 4 items, so :eq(0) will only work on the first of that. you actually want the first .message in every .request, returning 2 at a time
[06:13:59] <jak> hence the find
[06:14:05] <pachet>  http://jsfiddle.net/tys6v/
[06:14:20] <pachet> disregard that ;[
[06:14:43] <pachet> stupid paste keybinding :[
[06:15:31] <adrianp> i can't.. i must click it
[06:17:30] <dgx> How can I do this: in a lightboxed <div> after a form is send, to not close the modal window, instead just write a message?
[06:19:16] <_|Nix|_> Hi! What's the deal with outerHeight() during pagecreate and pagebeforeshow? It returns 2, and not the actual outerHeight of the element.
[06:20:57] <_|Nix|_> For example, in one of my widgets' _create() I had to add a setTimeout(function() {}, 0) to do the height calculation inside the anonymous function, because during _create() the  outerHeight() is wrongs, and _create() for the widget happens during pagecreate, because it's one of those auto-replace things.
[06:22:06] <_|Nix|_> So, I guess my question is: Past what point during the page loading/initialization process does outerWidth/outerHeight start to return the correct value?
[06:26:36] <pachet> does calling height() on the element return the correct value
[06:27:10] <ablomen> pachet, it should
[06:27:22] <ablomen> though without margin, padding, border and outline
[06:27:34] <pachet> that was re: _|Nix|_
[06:27:42] <ablomen> oh sorry
[06:28:17] <_|Nix|_> pachet: It returns 0.
[06:28:30] <_|Nix|_> pachet: During "pageshow", things work correctly.
[06:28:47] <_|Nix|_> pachet: So, at some point between pagebeforeshow and pageshow it starts to work.
[06:29:13] <_|Nix|_> pachet: However, that's too late for most initialization, because it'll cause the page to jerk around.
[06:29:40] <webroasters> good morning. I've added dynamically created textboxes and i'm trying to add them together when the user edits them (onclick). For example, textbox1 + textbox2 = textbox3 . Is this even possible with dynamically created input fields? If so, where do I start learning about implementation? for example, .event() or whatever
[06:30:27] <pachet> _|Nix|_ : that's expected behavior
[06:30:38] <bijoo> Hi, is there a way to intercept all ajax calls on the page? I tried the ajaxSend, but it's not getting triggered
[06:30:40] <pachet> pageshow corresponds to the page becoming visible
[06:30:42] <bijoo> Thanks in advance
[06:30:52] <pachet> before an element is visible, jquery cant calculate height or outerHeight
[06:31:48] <_|Nix|_> pachet: Aha ... but how come the element is not visible in pagebeforeshow? I mean that's before the page transition begins ...
[06:32:15] <_|Nix|_> pachet: The page should already be rendered at that point, just not yet slid/popped/whatever in.
[06:36:44] <pachet> before the transition begins, that page is display:none
[06:48:45] <pachet> webroasters: http://jsfiddle.net/8mctD/
[06:48:49] <pachet> late response ;o
[06:48:55] <webroasters> no worries

[07:02:03] <james13433> whats the best way to do a live toggle?
[07:06:31] <mazzachre> james13433: using toggle?
[07:06:46] <james13433> live toggle doesnt work mazzachre
[07:07:20] <xec> what is a live toggle?
[07:07:31] <TheCode> what's the best rss feed reader plugin?
[07:08:02] <james13433> like .live('click',
[07:08:11] <pachet> the problem is that toggle uses the click event
[07:08:20] <pachet> so if you are binding click with live
[07:08:22] <pachet> =issues
[07:08:32] <james13433> I want to do a toggle on some html, thats imported with ajax
[07:09:28] <xec> by toggle you mean show/hide?
[07:10:03] <james13433> At the moment I haev this, http://pastebin.com/VsxX6r89
[07:10:10] <james13433> but the first toggle takes 1 click
[07:10:18] <james13433> no xec I want to toggle an img src
[07:10:25] <james13433> 2 clicks *
[07:11:34] <james13433> and also show/hide something else at the same time
[07:12:48] <pachet> why not use live() to bind another event besides click
[07:12:50] <pachet> like mouseenter
[07:12:59] <pachet> that is responsible for establishing the toggle() binds
[07:13:24] <james13433> oachet youve lost me
[07:13:30] <james13433> pachet*
[07:14:11] <JiYu> when I am using the navbar in my jquery-mobile app then the javascript is not executed on the page that I switch. known problem?

[07:17:17] <james13433> pachet doesnt work all the time for some reason :(

[07:18:13] <blackspotwiggins> http://jsfiddle.net/p4nxB/1/
[07:18:18] <blackspotwiggins> the event gets bound over and over again
[07:18:32] <blackspotwiggins> if you dont care about performance, its ok
[07:19:24] <james13433> I wouldn't mind if it worked all the time.

[07:22:43] <blackspotwiggins> wtf
[07:22:56] <blackspotwiggins> why do you need to use live there?
[07:22:58] <blackspotwiggins> or even toggle?

[07:23:15] <oxez> hello. I'm using a dialog from the jquery-ui package, and I have the following issue: THe dialog's position is modified when I click a certain button (to appear on top of this button). However when I click another kind of button I want it to appear at the center of the screen. I've tried to change the position with .dialog(), it does put it in the middle of the screen, but then it scrolls up all the way up and I have to scroll down to see the dialog. Any ideas?
[07:23:41] <james13433> Can I make the click, trigger the seperate toggle function some how?
[07:23:54] <dropmouse> kborchers, that would be awesome- does animate support the scrollTop method
[07:24:19] <kborchers> yes, you can animate scrollTop
[07:24:35] <dropmouse> sweet, thanks
[07:25:09] <pachet> james13433: why not just write your own check into your click binding
[07:25:19] <pachet> if visible, do xyz else abc
[07:25:22] <kborchers> oxez: without seeing your code, is your "button" an anchor with an href of #
[07:25:27] <pachet> rather than making toggle do that for you
[07:25:34] <james13433> I tried that pachet, didnt seem to work for me.
[07:25:49] <blackspotwiggins> james13433, it can work
[07:26:39] <blackspotwiggins> just bind click and determine what to do inside the handler
[07:26:48] <oxez> kborchers: sigh. thanks
[07:27:00] <kborchers> ;)
[07:27:12] <oxez> kborchers: That's usually the first thing I add in my functions heh
[07:27:54] <james13433> ok, I sort of got it to work
[07:27:57] <ccmonsters> hola kids
[07:28:41] <pachet> hi
[07:29:02] <ccmonsters> hows things pachet? How's the framework/lib coming?
[07:29:03] <james13433> should allways remember to change },function(){ to  }else{
[07:30:22] <kitikonti> hmm jsfiddle dont work, or its only me
[07:31:33] <pachet> er, was that me? thought that was someone else that mentioned they were writing a framework
[07:31:42] <pachet> in 3 days or some nonsense
[07:31:52] <webroasters> hi guys. Here's my current pastebin: http://pastebin.com/KHabYqWL    This is working great until line 23-24. What's going on is that a uniqueid is being given for every node that is created. Inside every node, there's a removal button for that node. I've realized that when I press the removal button, I get the current uniqueid instead of the one that is supposed to be bound to that removal button ...Please help, I'm probably doing this wrong
[07:31:53] <kborchers> ?down jsfiddle.net @ kitikonti
[07:32:00] <bot-t> kitikonti, It's not just you! - http://jsfiddle.net looks down from here.
[07:32:54] <ralphholzmann> webroasters: you need a closure up in there
[07:33:27] <ralphholzmann> also upgrading your jquery wouldn't hurt either
[07:33:30] <ralphholzmann> if you can
[07:33:30] <webroasters> can you give me an example of what you're talking about
[07:33:37] <ralphholzmann> yep, 1 sec
[07:33:42] <webroasters> ok thanks
[07:33:54] <kitikonti> jsfiddle works again
[07:34:43] <webroasters> brb
[07:34:52] <kitikonti> why my menu dont slide up on the secound click http://jsfiddle.net/sWuPb/4/
[07:36:02] <ralphholzmann> webroasters: something like this: http://pastebin.com/z5WfTuen
[07:38:28] <kborchers> ?live @ kitikonti
[07:38:28] <bot-t> kitikonti, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[07:38:37] <kborchers> kitikonti: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/sWuPb/5/
[07:38:45] <ccmonsters> beat me to it.
[07:38:49] <ccmonsters> .live() is your friend.
[07:39:43] <kitikonti> ahhh
[07:40:09] <ralphholzmann> webroasters: work?
[07:40:51] <blackspotwiggins> shouldn't we be telling people to use delegate() instead of live() ?
[07:40:53] <Paul_B_Hartzog> n e 1 here? (joke)
[07:41:00] <Paul_B_Hartzog> yeah, delegate()
[07:41:02] <Paul_B_Hartzog> imo
[07:41:08] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i have a quick question
[07:41:42] <ralphholzmann> blackspotwiggins: yeah, but webroasters is using jquery 1.3
[07:41:50] <blackspotwiggins> ah
[07:41:51] <blackspotwiggins> ok
[07:42:12] <blackspotwiggins> in that case we should be telling to upgrade their lib and then use delegate()
[07:43:32] <kborchers> kitikonti: blackspotwiggins is right. delegate would be better see ?delegate
[07:43:32] <bot-t> kitikonti, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:45:18] <webroasters> @ralphholzmann: I'm sorry I was away. Yes, it does work! THank you!
[07:46:53] <kitikonti> kborchers: hmm but delegate dont work http://jsfiddle.net/sWuPb/6/
[07:47:08] <pachet> ?ask @ Paul_B_Hartzog
[07:47:08] <bot-t> Paul_B_Hartzog, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:47:22] <Paul_B_Hartzog> kewl, thx
[07:47:27] <Paul_B_Hartzog> catb, good reference
[07:47:31] <Paul_B_Hartzog> I teach that one
[07:47:42] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i am using php sessions and jquery .load
[07:47:42] <kborchers> kitikonti: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/sWuPb/8/
[07:48:01] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i need to know if .load() will use stored session info when making requests
[07:48:20] <kitikonti> kborchers: why this work and my version not
[07:48:21] <ralphholzmann> Paul_B_Hartzog: yes, it will
[07:48:43] <Paul_B_Hartzog> so if the page requested requires that a user be logged in, will that check in the requested php page still trigger properly?
[07:49:09] <pachet> yes
[07:49:14] <Paul_B_Hartzog> sweet
[07:49:16] <danzik17> kitikonti: The way you're using delegate won't work because the selector your providing doesn't exist at the time you're trying to create the delegate, kborchers works becayse the ul always exists and he changed the matched selector in the delegate
[07:49:28] <danzik17> s/your/you're
[07:49:29] <kitikonti> ahhhhh
[07:49:36] <kitikonti> ok i understand
[07:49:41] <kborchers> danzik17: thanks, i was just trying to find the best way to word that :)
[07:51:27] <dropmouse> for whatever reason, doesn't seem like i can animate a scrollTop to the .offset().top of another object...
[07:51:53] <kborchers> ?demo @ dropmouse
[07:51:54] <bot-t> dropmouse, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:53:13] <Glook> Are there any known issues with the mousetip plugin (http://plugins.jquery.com/project/mousetip) and Firefox?  The plugin is functioning in Chrome and IE, but not in Fireforx 7 or 6.0.2.
[07:57:18] <Paul_B_Hartzog> I am attempting to build a drupal-like CMS using jQuery that is a "single page application."  Does anyone know of any already existing?
[07:57:59] <Jo_> hello
[07:58:29] <Jo_> anyone?
[07:58:40] <pachet> hi ;o
[07:58:43] <Jo_> hello
[07:58:52] <Jo_> can anyone help me?
[07:59:06] <bot-t> Jo_, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[07:59:25] <Jo_> ok, sry
[07:59:41] <Dave_Stein> that's a bot answering that automatically
[07:59:46] <Jo_> yeah
[07:59:51] <Jo_> but still, it helped
[08:00:15] <ajpiano> Paul_B_Hartzog: using jQuery to buid a CMS is like using a hammer to build a house
[08:00:22] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: the term is automagically
[08:00:28] <kborchers> ;)
[08:00:31] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: stfu :)
[08:00:33] <Dave_Stein> haha
[08:00:33] <kborchers> heh
[08:00:37] <ajpiano> it's a useful tool, but you need a lot more infrastructure than that
[08:00:40] <Jo_> im having some difficulty with .append
[08:00:46] <pachet> but how awesome would it be to build a house with just a hammer
[08:00:59] <Dave_Stein> i've actually built houses - and hammers are pretty fun
[08:01:02] <pachet> you'd get laid for millenia on that credit alone
[08:01:09] <webroasters> is there something else to use instead of .change() for an input box. I've tried blur, mouseup, etc. to no avail
[08:01:14] <Dave_Stein> pachet: they've made a hotel out of ice, let's make a hosue out of hammers
[08:01:17] <Wilto> Just swinging a hammer wildly in the air, while standing on a cement foundation.
[08:01:22] <James-_> hello how i can resolve conflict between jquery and javascript plugin ?
[08:01:28] <Dave_Stein> webroasters & Jo_ code samples please?

[08:01:35] <Jo_> welll
[08:01:45] <Jo_> hard, cus im not even begun
[08:02:01] <Jo_> in my html i declared a div with the id content
[08:02:02] <kborchers> Jo_: then how do you have a problem?
[08:02:12] <rclanan> with everything prefabed nowadays you could almost build a house with just a hammer.. though the eletrical and plumbing might be an issue.. = /
[08:02:13] <blackspotwiggins> ajpiano, thats how you build wonders of world in age of empires tho :)
[08:02:18] <blackspotwiggins> hammers = power
[08:02:22] <pachet> ^
[08:02:25] <pachet> listen to the man
[08:02:26] <dropmouse> James-_ i use, jQuery.noConflict() ,
[08:02:27] <pachet> he speaks truth
[08:02:33] <watchedman> Jo_ even posting your HTML might be helpful
[08:02:53] <blackspotwiggins> then again  you can start a fire in aoe by hitting a house with a sword.
[08:02:54] <watchedman> pasting, i should say
[08:03:03] <ajpiano> blackspotwiggins: call me back when your trebuchet has an infinite supply of flaming boulders
[08:03:21] <blackspotwiggins> heh yeah
[08:03:29] <Jo_> its mening there should be for a video gallery based on jquery's .append and colorbox, the jquery should, when my user writes the info, it should build it for them..

[08:03:55] <Jo_> still building a little
[08:04:39] <Baribal> Hi. If there are several $(function() { /* body */ } in a script, do they all get executed or just the first?
[08:04:51] <ajpiano> they all get run
[08:05:03] <bambams> I have a message that I fade in and out after a successful operation, however, it's possible for the user to repeat the action again before the fading is complete.
[08:05:33] <bambams> The fading gets queued up and that's annoying so I'm trying to make it stop, clear the queue, and start over again.
[08:05:37] <Jo_> . append should make this inside the div (<a class="example6 cboxElement" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/617ANIA5Rqs?rel=0&wmode=transparent" title="The Knife: We Share Our Mother's Health">Flash / Video (Iframe/Direct Link To YouTube)</a>)
[08:05:46] <Jo_> not precisely
[08:05:48] <kborchers> ?stop @ bambams
[08:05:48] <bot-t> bambams, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[08:05:52] <bambams> Instead, it seems to completely disable the queue so that new fading no longer happens.
[08:06:06] <bambams> kborchers: Yes, I'm using stop.
[08:06:32] <dropmouse> James-_, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[08:06:32] <Jo_> any ideas?
[08:06:39] <Baribal> Thanks, ajpiano. Then something in this page I'm working on is reeeeaaaally broken...
[08:07:06] <Jo_> it should be a really simple write to div code.
[08:07:46] <bambams> My code:   e.stop(true).fadeIn(500).delay(1000).fadeOut(2000);
[08:08:02] <Jo_> .append (<a class="example6 cboxElement" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/617ANIA5Rqs?rel=0&wmode=transparent" title="The Knife: We Share Our Mother's Health">Flash / Video (Iframe/Direct Link To YouTube)</a>)
[08:08:06] <Paul_B_Hartzog> ok I just built a test app that verifies that you can store something like a user's role in a session variable and then use that var to determine whether to serve a page when a page is requested via .load().  It works great.
[08:08:20] <ajpiano> Jo_: you have to wrap a string of html in quotes when you pass it to append
[08:08:37] <Paul_B_Hartzog> fwiw, I'm using sammy.js to load named routes and I just need to make sure the public and private ones stay distinct
[08:08:42] <ajpiano> $("#foo").append('<a href="#bar">wat</a>');
[08:09:54] <Jo_> what does the #foo do?
[08:09:59] <Jo_> is it the div?
[08:10:08] <ajpiano> ?w metasyntactic variable
[08:10:09] <bot-t> ajpiano, Metasyntactic variable - In computer science, programmers use metasyntactic variables to describe a placeholder name or an alias term commonly used to denote the subject matter under discussion or an arbitrary member of a class of things under discussion. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable
[08:10:24] <Jo_> ? .append
[08:10:25] <bot-t> .append(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[08:11:39] <Jo_> does $("#Div").append('<a>test</a>'); write or overwrite?
[08:11:51] <ajpiano> it adds it to the end of the div
[08:11:53] <Jo_> should i use append or prepend?
[08:11:56] <ajpiano> that's what the word "append means"
[08:12:02] <kborchers> ?define append
[08:12:03] <Jo_> yeah
[08:12:04] <bot-t> kborchers, append - (verb) To hang or attach to, as by a string, so that the thing is suspended; as, a seal appended to a record; the inscription was appended to the column.
[08:12:09] <ajpiano> i don't know, it depends if you want to put it at the beginning or the beginning
[08:12:23] <Elephant> woah woah, this is jQuery, not PhD english comp okay.
[08:12:52] <dropmouse> I'm having trouble using animate with scrollTop, I've seen forum posts on jquery site staing that this should work: http://jsfiddle.net/XjHLc/ is a simple demo I've set up, to me looks like it should work
[08:13:01] <Jo_> $("#Div").append('<a class="example6 cboxElement" href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/617ANIA5Rqs?rel=0&wmode=transparent" title="The Knife: We Share Our Mother's Health">Flash / Video (Iframe/Direct Link To YouTube)</a>');
[08:13:06] <Jo_> will it work?
[08:13:27] <atula> give it a try, Jo_
[08:13:48] <Jo_> okay
[08:14:10] <muzone> Elephant: haha
[08:14:33] <Jo_> hmmm
[08:14:36] <Jo_> welll
[08:14:41] <Jo_> well*
[08:14:50] <Jo_> i have to acces it from another site
[08:14:55] <Jo_> i will do a
[08:15:00] <Jo_> or
[08:15:03] <Jo_> hmm
[08:15:34] <atula> what's with the <enter> key repeatedly, Jo_
[08:16:00] <Jo_> Webdomain.net/Cp.htm form info into Webdomain.net/index.htm
[08:16:03] <Jo_> how?
[08:20:04] <kborchers> dropmouse: you need to scroll body
[08:20:18] <atula> Jo_, that URL is an ad. Explain yourself.
[08:20:52] <dropmouse> kborchers, thanks, I've tried document, 'body', 'html' ... none seemt o work, I'm sure its just the way I'm plementing it
[08:21:07] <Jo_> ohhh, no
[08:21:15] <Jo_> u said u needed the html
[08:21:26] <Jo_> thats the place its gonna be placed
[08:21:45] <kborchers> dropmouse: don't put js in your href http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/XjHLc/9/ and also it helps to select jQuery rather than Mootools http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/XjHLc/9/
[08:22:00] <pachet> atula jokes
[08:22:12] <TheCode> Is there a rever look up feature for objects in jq?
[08:22:12] <dropmouse> yeah, I have jQuery selected. I dunno why it didn't save that...
[08:22:22] <TheCode> reverse*
[08:22:26] <atula> pachet, ?
[08:23:01] <kborchers> TheCode: what are you trying to do?

[08:25:40] <PhanLord> is it better to use pageshow or pageinit event ?
[08:25:58] <pachet> depends
[08:25:59] <wgo> I have a draggable and click event on the same element. Is there a way to stop the click event firing on drag stop?
[08:26:17] <wgo> At the moment when I stop dragging the click event fires.
[08:27:04] <PhanLord> i just want to setup bunch of stuff after everythgin jquery/mbile has done with the page
[08:27:15] <pachet> wgo: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1771627/preventing-click-event-with-jquery-drag-and-drop
[08:27:30] <wgo> thanks pachet
[08:29:07] <pachet> PhanLord: if what you're doing depends on the page being rendered (size calculations, etc), that stuff has to go in pageshow
[08:29:10] <pachet> otherwise pageinit
[08:29:27] <PhanLord> k im doing some resizing oo so illg uess il keep it in show
[08:29:36] <Deafgoose_> Can anybody help me with a selector? I have $("div[id^='post_message']:not(span)") , I want to exclude the span tag however this is not working for me
[08:30:19] <Zlatev> since you're starting with "div"
[08:30:26] <Zlatev> no need to exclude span
[08:30:27] <vviljanen> well the not(span) is quite obsolete, because div != span
[08:30:37] <Zlatev> exactlly
[08:31:12] <Deafgoose_> Im selecting the htm inside the div, but the html contained within the span, which is inside the div tag, I would like to exclude
[08:31:23] <Deafgoose_> how would I go about this?
[08:33:19] <pachet> clone it and remove the span, then grab the html
[08:34:54] <wgo> pachet, that worked perfect - many thanks.

[09:10:17] <enjoycrf> thank you
[09:10:38] <apollo13> di3sel: your problem is that by the time your .click executes there a no img elements in the DOM yet (is beeing constructed currently). Hence you need to move it into document.ready as atu​la told you

[09:12:40] <enjoycrf> megusta
[09:12:48] <ccmonsters> lol
[09:12:48] <enjoycrf> ;/
[09:13:49] <Dual_Detroit> I need an opinion on my rap:
[09:14:05] <pachet> wrong channel
[09:14:19] <enjoycrf> y wrong chaeenl
[09:14:22] <enjoycrf> were idling
[09:14:36] <Dual_Detroit> Alright, DUAL DETROIT is in da house! Our keyboards ar large! Our software is in charge!
[09:14:46] <ajpiano> Dual_Detroit: are you Madonna?
[09:14:50] <enjoycrf> thats wack
[09:15:03] <enjoycrf> detroit
[09:15:25] <Dual_Detroit> Motown motherfuckers know I rock the 313. Yeah, I've got the database degree. It's my PHD.
[09:15:31] <ajpiano> Dual_Detroit: you have to stop
[09:15:40] <Dual_Detroit> Okay, too much I guess.
[09:15:42] <enjoycrf> ya ur raps r realy bad
[09:15:52] <enjoycrf> just like ur code
[09:15:56] <Dual_Detroit> enjoycrf: u can't handle it
[09:15:57] <enjoycrf> probly
[09:16:15] <enjoycrf> runaway booooooooooooooooys
[09:16:34] <enjoycrf> dundundundun
[09:16:51] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: please stop and consider whether you really need to actually constantly keep typing into this channel
[09:17:09] <enjoycrf> ya but were idling tho
[09:17:18] <jedimind_> ie. "Just 'cuz your mommy bought you a keyboard, doesnt mean you have to use it"
[09:17:19] <ajpiano> that's not the way it works
[09:17:49] <enjoycrf> how come
[09:18:51] <enjoycrf> jus wondering
[09:19:03] <ajpiano> because it violates any reasonable standard of irc etiquette
[09:19:04] <enjoycrf> what do we do?
[09:19:26] <ajpiano> if there is a channel that is set up as a support or specifc purpose channel for a particular subject
[09:19:34] <ajpiano> you don't just blather on endlessly because it happens to be quiet when you arrive
[09:19:44] <enjoycrf> fine
[09:19:52] <enjoycrf> irc is worse than the army
[09:19:57] <ajpiano> there are plenty of places to schmooze on irc
[09:20:13] <enjoycrf> ok i go to socialites
[09:24:07] <sphinxxx> can someone explain to me how this is done? http://www.360langstrasse.sf.tv/page/
[09:24:31] <smftre> I think I've gotten myself into a silly loop, I populate a .dialog with an ajax return and then attach a click listener to an id element within, but then when you click that it repopulates the .dialog with the same ajax return but with different parameters, so the theory works 100%, but the click listener doesnt. Any ideas?
[09:25:12] <aro> i need a way to measure the HTTP response time of a web site with jquery - how would i do this?
[09:25:19] <atula> sphinxxx, I think it's just animating scrolltop and when scrolltop stops just animate the bubbles
[09:25:29] <aro> or is it better to use a native XMLHTTPRequest object and calculate based on readyStateChange?
[09:26:15] <sphinxxx> is it a video in the background?
[09:26:17] <sphinxxx> atula*
[09:27:14] <smftre> sphinxxx: that's pretty cool
[09:28:31] <pifantastic> aro: this technique uses an iframe: http://webwait.com/
[09:29:56] <aro> i just want to measure how long it takes to establish the TCP connection
[09:30:07] <aro> i dont need to measure the length of time it takes to download the page
[09:30:36] <smftre> sphinxxx: a div contains an image container, and it is changed many times as the scrollbar is moved.
[09:31:11] <atula> sphinxxx, hmmm... didn't see the transition part... interesting... it might be a streched flash clip?
[09:31:15] <smftre> sphinxxx: there are 1050 images
[09:31:22] <smftre> they are jpgs
[09:31:27] <atula> holycow
[09:31:35] <atula> so that's just replacing jpgs
[09:31:38] <atula> that's rough
[09:31:50] <smftre> would hate to see that on a slow connection
[09:32:03] <smftre> can anyone answer my question?
[09:32:05] <atula> to get it to fill the page... I would imagine 100% width and position absolute top0, left0
[09:32:18] <smftre> width: 1899px; height: 1186.88px; position: fixed; left: 0px; top: -274.438px; display: block;
[09:32:30] <smftre> worked out in js
[09:33:07] <atula> smftre, have you looked at .delegate ?
[09:33:14] <atula> that would solve the issue of rebinding and such
[09:33:36] <smftre> atula: I havnt.. not sure how to handle it in my loop though.. hmm
[09:33:43] <atula> oooh don't loop
[09:33:52] <atula> try avoiding stuff in loop
[09:33:54] <atula> heh
[09:34:00] <atula> delegate would really help you here I think
[09:34:01] <smftre> think i've screwed myself ovr
[09:34:11] <atula> smftre, have you ever heard of .live ?
[09:34:23] <smftre> i have, but the retardation in me wont let me
[09:34:24] <smftre> :D
[09:34:44] <atula> look at delegate. it will help you through this I believe
[09:35:09] <smftre> atula: here's an example of what I'm doing: http://pastebin.com/4ZeGkPB9
[09:36:07] <atula> smftre, lol. let's think about this for a second.
[09:36:08] <smftre> atula: line 31 is where I get screwed
[09:36:23] <dwarder> am i understand right that this code <a onclick="$('#m_76 #m_62 #m_75').attr('checked','checked');">test</a> will make this 3 elements checked: <input type=checkbox id=m_76> ... and 2 others with matched id
[09:36:27] <smftre> I have led myself down a silly path, and I want to cry
[09:36:27] <dwarder> s
[09:36:31] <atula> yeah.. it looks like some recursion is going on... this is why a nice delegate will help
[09:36:56] <smftre> atula: and how would I implement it? any easy way, a nice one liner :D
[09:36:56] <dwarder> for some reason it doesn't make them checked
[09:37:03] <atula> dwarder, selectors are separated by comma $('#id1, #id2...')
[09:37:03] <sphinxxx> yea a crapload of images
[09:37:06] <sphinxxx> i was surprised
[09:37:09] <sphinxxx> thought it might be a video
[09:37:16] <atula> discregarding the obtrusive js you're doing of course dwarder
[09:37:36] <smftre> sphinxxx: but it wasnt :P
[09:37:38] <atula> sphinxxx, I don't think it's worth it
[09:37:58] <atula> I would stay away from the "cool" stuff just for the shake of looking "cool"
[09:38:01] <dwarder> atula: thanks
[09:38:08] <atula> let's build functional stuff, people :)
[09:38:33] <cf_PhillipSenn> How would you write this using jQuery?  "If you ain't got no money, take your broke ass home"?
[09:39:09] <ajpiano> if ( !money ) { return; }
[09:39:10] * smftre looks for a tissue
[09:39:25] <atula> smftre, so describe the process/flow you're trying to do here. perhaps we can redesign it
[09:39:31] <geekbuntu> <div id='ass'></div> $('#ass').txt('If you ain't got no money, take your broke ass home');  ?
[09:40:02] <cf_PhillipSenn> What about using window.location?
[09:40:16] <atula> !$ && window.location.href = '/'
[09:40:17] <geekbuntu> that's what jquery is doing...
[09:40:23] <geekbuntu> oh
[09:40:24] <geekbuntu> nvm
[09:40:25] <geekbuntu> :-D
[09:41:20] <sphinxxx> its all about looking cool though
[09:41:39] <smftre> atula: I create a dialog and populate it with the return of an ajax call, I then attach a click() event to a button that was in that ajax returned content, All this is fine, BUT..... then I use the click() event to trigger the button and the loop begins, it then returns the ajax content with that button I still want clickable, same ID all that, but it isnt clickable anymore...
[09:42:08] <atula> oh okay. simple stuff, smftre
[09:42:27] <smftre> atula: yes, it is simple if you dont do it in a $hit way like I did
[09:42:41] <smftre> atula: so you can see my code that I'm doing it with, wtf
[09:42:49] <Orphis> I'm having problems with IE9 and cross domain ajax requests
[09:43:00] <atula> first, you want to do something like $('.yourdialogbox-selector').delegate('thebuttonselector, 'click', function (e) { // do stuff; });
[09:43:01] <Orphis> The page is there http://www.orphis.net/spotizer/index2.php . Can someone tell me what's wrong ?
[09:43:02] <sphinxxx> atula, smftre: i found this http://jquery.vostrel.cz/reel#download
[09:43:16] <Orphis> It works with other browsers by the way
[09:43:20] <sphinxxx> but it doesnt have the "gliding" that the site had, so after you stop scrolling it still goes a little bit more
[09:43:42] <Dual_Detroit> ajpiano: Detroit is Madonna, yes.
[09:44:05] <pachet> timely response is timely
[09:46:46] <smftre> atula: wow, that was easy :D thanks
[09:46:56] <atula> smftre, did it work ?
[09:47:00] <smftre> hell yeah
[09:47:07] <atula> smftre, oh goodie
[09:47:12] <atula> to lunch I go.
[09:47:14] <smftre> I just changed my click() to $dialog.delegate('#changeEmailSave', 'click', function (e) { and BOOM!
[09:47:26] <smftre> atula: thanks again and enjoy lunch
[09:47:59] <zerovic> hey guys, i need some help...currently im working on a word checker, which scans the text in a textarea for the missing keywords..if a keyword is missing, it stops and alerts which one is missing. my problem is, that if i add the text with all the required keywords, it works, when I leave one keyword, it alerts the missing one, once i add the one missing, it gives me the alert that everything is ok, but it wont redirect
[09:50:18] <giotti_> Hi guys (and gals)! I'm trying to get a drag-select for a table working (this: http://jsfiddle.net/Brv6J/3/), but in another file that is loaded later through ajax, I tried adding live-handlers to the code (like this: http://tinypaste.com/612ef2), but it fails... Using the original code in <script> tags together with the part that is loaded, doesn't seem to work either... Can anyone help out?
[09:53:01] <zerovic> http://jsfiddle.net/NqkdR/3/
[09:53:07] <dbpatterson> I have a top level event handler that is triggered on certain elements (this means that when parts of the page are replaced asynchronously, I don't have to re-bind handlers). I have one on links that I want to display a dialog and only follow the link if they confirm. The dialog works (with standard confirm()), but I have tried event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropogation() and returning false, but the link is still followed regardle
[09:53:14] <zerovic> any help appriciated ;)
[09:55:46] <macmartine> If I have an element $event, how do I access it's children that have class '.wc-title' ?
[09:56:58] <Orphis> Any idea for my Ajax problem ?
[09:58:46] <jedimind_> sigh
[09:58:57] <jedimind_> can i rant about the size of plugins for jquery ?
[09:59:04] <jedimind_> i mean a 40k password strength plugin ? seriously ?
[09:59:16] <sphinxxx> zerovic
[09:59:41] <sphinxxx> all that code should be within the submit handler
[10:01:31] <pachet> jedimind_: i blame broadband
[10:01:53] <pachet> people sometimes forget theres a premium on request speed ;[
[10:01:55] <zerovic> sphinxxx: would you mind to make the correction and update it? it drives me crazy :/
[10:05:51] <sphinxxx> sure one sec
[10:06:02] <zerovic> thanks a lot ;)
[10:10:47] <sphinxxx> zerovic: http://jsfiddle.net/NqkdR/17/
[10:13:11] <zerovic> thanks a lot sphinxxx! works like charm :)
[10:13:28] <brendanjerwin> So, how do I get JQuery ($.getJson) to make actual dates out of my date-like values?
[10:15:21] <pachet> is it a timestamp ;o
[10:15:57] <erichynds> jQuery doesn't have any date helpers
[10:16:48] <brendanjerwin> I assume there is some way to tie into the pipeline so that it creates dates in the JSON response.
[10:17:06] <pachet> sure
[10:17:13] <pachet> just pass the right values to Date()
[10:17:14] <pachet> ;o
[10:18:13] <johnywp> I am using this code http://pastebin.com/psBcvNi7
[10:18:19] <johnywp> to load 2 versions of jquery
[10:18:24] <brendanjerwin> is the hook dataFilters or converters?
[10:19:26] <johnywp> then instead of using $, i use j1a2a3 for all the functions/scripts that need to use the old jquery version, and jQuery for those that need the new one
[10:19:41] <johnywp> do you see anything wrong with this code? i am asking because it obviously doesn't work
[10:19:43] <EMKO> http://pastebin.com/bhLhf62s how do i use the page varible for CKEDITOR.replace ? only seems to work if i manuly put a number
[10:22:41] <giotti_> I put the live() code in here (http://jsfiddle.net/xnGhy/1/) and commented out the original. Can someone have a look at why it doesn't work with live()?
[10:22:53] <tomasm-> hi, if im using json to return back some html content into a variable, is it possible to eval any script tags within that html content? we're assuming this is all json content
[10:23:26] <tomasm-> or will the scripts execute once the html is added to the DOM?
[10:23:50] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: thats how you do it yes
[10:24:04] <BBonifield> brendanjerwin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L536 you can see in the source that you don't have any way of adjusting how the json is parsed.  you just need to handle it manually
[10:24:12] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: when jquery adds it to the dom it will strip out the scripts and add them to the header instead though
[10:24:40] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: but as long as you write your js "correctly" it should work just fine
[10:24:50] <tomasm-> Cork[home], you mean it works automatically? how/where does it strip it out?
[10:25:26] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: when you append html to the dom, jquery searches for script tags
[10:25:59] <tomasm-> Cork[home], and thats part of dom insertion and not ajax querying?
[10:26:02] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: it has nothing really to do with json though
[10:26:23] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: ajax never touches the dom, unless its something like jsonp
[10:26:53] <tomasm-> ok, thanks.... ill try it out
[10:26:56] <Cork[home]> (then it injects a script tag in the head to do the ajax call)
[10:27:46] <tomasm-> Cork[home], oh, so would firebug show me the script tag inside HEAD? or does it just get eval()'ed? I wondered how it ran when i never saw the tags
[10:28:29] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: the script tab shows some of them, but no script tags doesn't show in the html tab
[10:28:36] <dwarder> how do i pass an array to $_GET
[10:28:52] <dwarder> &var=arrayhere
[10:28:55] <dwarder> commas?
[10:29:13] <tomasm-> dwarder, var[]=item1&var[]=item2&var[]=item3
[10:29:15] <dwarder> &var=(val1,val2)?
[10:29:27] <dwarder> tomasm-: thanks
[10:29:37] <Cork[home]> $.ajax({ url:'', data:{ val:['','','','',''] } }
[10:29:46] <Cork[home]> no need to generate strings
[10:29:55] <Cork[home]> jquery does it for you
[10:30:01] <Cork[home]> dwarder: ^
[10:30:21] <dwarder> that is greet
[10:30:24] <dwarder> great*
[10:31:50] <EMKO> if i want to use a variable how do i call it?
[10:32:05] <sk8ball> I'm using Entity Framework 4.1/ASP.NET (C#), + jQuery/AJAX + WCF Data Service.... what is the best solution for JSON encoding entity objects which tend to have circular references?
[10:32:14] <Cork[home]> EMKO: that has WAY to little context
[10:32:30] <EMKO> like in php i would use $variable name
[10:32:46] <Cork[home]> EMKO: you mean plain js varaibles?
[10:32:50] <EMKO> yup
[10:32:51] <snover> ?101 @ EMKO
[10:32:52] <bot-t> EMKO, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[10:37:16] <johnywp> running two versions of jquery through this code http://pastebin.com/psBcvNi7 - then instead of using $, i use j1a2a3 for all the functions/scripts that need to use the old jquery version, and I was hoping to use jQuery for those that need the new version, but jQuery doesn't work
[10:37:18] <johnywp> any ideas?
[10:42:19] <enjoycrf> ummm
[10:43:01] <enjoycrf> is there a way to do jq dom comands on string
[10:43:39] <enjoycrf> like $('.target').attr
[10:43:49] <enjoycrf> but on a string
[10:44:03] <enjoycrf> of html
[10:44:11] <danzik17> enjoycrf: A DOM string?  What string?
[10:44:11] <enjoycrf> instead of the page html
[10:44:31] <enjoycrf> yeah like before ur about to pupulate a container
[10:44:35] <enjoycrf> with that html
[10:44:39] <enjoycrf> and do $()
[10:44:47] <enjoycrf> u would run $() on that string
[10:44:48] <danzik17> enjoycrf: $( string ).attr( 'foo', 'bar')
[10:45:01] <enjoycrf> no way
[10:46:26] <enjoycrf> function(o) {
[10:46:26] <enjoycrf> 				if (!o) return;
[10:46:26] <enjoycrf> 				
[10:46:26] <enjoycrf> 				
[10:46:26] <enjoycrf> 				alert($(o).html());
[10:46:37] <enjoycrf> that the complete callback
[10:46:46] <jedimind_> jesus christ
[10:46:47] <enjoycrf> its kinda working actually
[10:46:52] <jedimind_> are you mildly fucking retarded or something enjoycrf ?
[10:46:59] <enjoycrf> what
[10:47:22] <jedimind_> you've already been told to not talk so fucking much, and yet my entire buffer is filled with you talking to yourself and pasting code into the channel
[10:47:29] <jedimind_> and hitting enter every fucking 3rd word
[10:48:07] <snover> jedimind_: take a breath :)
[10:48:11] <enjoycrf> fuck you tweaker
[10:48:11] <Cork[home]> jedimind_: cool down
[10:48:20] <Cork[home]> enjoycrf: you to
[10:48:25] <snover> o
[10:48:28] <enjoycrf> i out
[10:48:42] <jedimind_> thank christ
[10:49:01] <Cork[home]> jedimind_: don't make this channel into a flam channel
[10:49:06] <Cork[home]> theres no need for that
[10:49:25] <jedimind> you realize how hypocritical what you just said is, right? :)
[10:49:35] <snover> enoughhhh.
[10:49:45] <jedimind> i was done after i said what i had to say, im all peachy
[10:49:54] <Cork[home]> jedimind: nothing hyporicital in it
[10:50:08] <jedimind> its okay brother
[10:53:07] <gryg> hello, any idea how center popup vertical and horizontal on very long page?
[10:53:28] <gryg> just to see it in center of current view
[10:54:01] <jedimind> gryg, you would probably be better off with a bit of CSS rather than trying to calculate it with jquery
[10:54:07] <jedimind> fixed position and dead-center
[10:54:09] <Xeon06_> Hey guys
[10:54:23] <Xeon06_> Is there any way to bind the same event handler for multiple elements?
[10:54:34] <jedimind> gryg, http://reisio.com/examples/deadcenter/
[10:54:41] <Xeon06_> A bit like this, but in a way that it would work: http://jsfiddle.net/Xeon06/4FBg3/
[10:55:06] <jedimind> $('#foo, #bar').click()
[10:55:19] <jedimind> its just like a css selector
[10:55:19] <DragonZ> any1 have a min to help me out with an issue?
[10:55:27] <jedimind> DragonZ, dont ask to ask? :)
[10:55:31] <DragonZ> lol ok
[10:55:32] <gryg> hmm, ok
[10:55:35] <DragonZ> http://jsfiddle.net/nzSSk/18/
[10:55:47] <DragonZ> change the bottom ddlb to make a TR appear / disappear
[10:55:52] <DragonZ> in IE, it shifts the rest of the cells
[10:55:55] <DragonZ> which i dont want
[10:56:18] <Xeon06_> jedimind: This is a simplified example. I don't have string selectors to the elements
[10:56:59] <DragonZ> im testing in IE9 (compat mode off)
[10:57:03] <jedimind> Xeon06_, so what do you have if you dont have selectors for the elements?
[10:57:12] <jedimind> DragonZ, that seems like more of a css issue
[10:57:25] <Xeon06_> jedimind: I have the selectors to the elements I created myself
[10:57:26] <jedimind> though off hand, you cant really just hide/show TRs/TBODYs with display: none / block;
[10:57:40] <jedimind> Xeon06_, how does that differ from what i offered then? you can use any selector...
[10:57:51] <DragonZ> jedi - whats the proper way ?
[10:58:10] <jedimind> well, firstly, none of this is tabular data so don't use tables
[10:58:17] <Xeon06_> jedimind: http://jsfiddle.net/Xeon06/4FBg3/1/
[10:58:26] <jedimind> and secondly, you can do display: none; but to re-show it, you should be setting display: table-row; for example
[10:58:29] <DragonZ> jedi - heh , well that I dont have any say in unfortunately
[10:58:30] <jedimind> or table-group
[10:58:36] <DragonZ> (no tables that is)
[10:59:23] <DragonZ> jedi - so instead of using show, use .css() to set the display
[10:59:43] <TheDracle> I'm having some trouble using 'trigger' in conjunction with a target.
[11:00:05] <jedimind> DragonZ, yeah taht should resolve the issue
[11:00:18] <DragonZ> ok lemme try that out
[11:00:34] <TheDracle> jQuery.event.trigger({type:'onVideo', passed:passed}, null, $('#player'))
[11:00:49] <TheDracle> The third argument to trigger, as far as I know, should refer to the target.
[11:01:04] <Cork[home]> uh...
[11:01:13] <TheDracle> If I set up an event on $('#player') and call the above call with the third argument as null, I get the event.
[11:01:30] <johnywp> running two versions of jquery through this code http://pastebin.com/psBcvNi7 - then instead of using $, i use j1a2a3 for all the functions/scripts that need to use the old jquery version, and I was hoping to use jQuery for those that need the new version, but jQuery doesn't work
[11:01:48] <Cork[home]> TheDracle: why don't you just use trigger on the target?
[11:01:51] <jedimind> Xeon06_, one sec brother sidetracked for a minute
[11:01:55] <danzik17> TheDracle: Why use that and not $('#player').trigger('onVideo') ?
[11:02:19] <Cork[home]> 'video' not 'onvideo' though
[11:02:24] <Xeon06_> jedimind: No problem. I think I have a solution though, .add seems to do the job
[11:03:04] <jedimind> yeah, actually was going to suggest $(foo).add(bar)....
[11:03:19] <TheDracle> danzik17, No reason- I'll try this.
[11:03:25] <jedimind> though there must be a way to manage multiple objects
[11:04:36] <jedimind> for the record, though, Xeon06_ $(element, scope) thats what the , does
[11:04:43] <jedimind> it searches for the element within that scope
[11:05:00] <gryg> damn, first time problem with css :D
[11:06:09] <TheDracle> danzik17, How do I pass arguments like I do above using .trigger?
[11:06:31] <TheDracle> danzik17, Currently I pass in 'passed:val', and it ends up in the context of the callback.
[11:07:06] <danzik17> TheDracle: $('#player').trigger('onVideo', {foo: 'bar' }) believe, check ?trigger
[11:07:53] <jpolan> hello,
[11:07:56] <Xeon06_> jedimind: Ahh, so it's not an "addition" like in CSS then?
[11:08:18] <jpolan> Is there some hack to get an iframe's current URL once it has left the initial URL? (with an external domain)
[11:08:18] <jedimind> it is, if you contain it within quotes
[11:08:31] <jedimind> $('#el1, #el2', '#parent')
[11:08:34] <jedimind> as an example
[11:08:52] <jedimind> so it'll look for #el1 and #el2 within #parent only
[11:08:55] <johnywp> i found someone having the same problem here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2830510/jquery-noconflict-not-working-in-ie8-only
[11:09:08] <johnywp> would you recommend any of those fixes?
[11:10:07] <aple> Anyone know why jQueryUI is making .ui-dialog-titlebar ridiculously tall? http://i.imgur.com/LXzH9.jpg
[11:10:09] <Camer0n> http://advancedmetalart.com/shop.html if you go there, why wont the first image load
[11:10:27] <Camer0n> i am using a loading script to try and make it dynamic but it isnt working
[11:10:37] <jedimind> aple, that seems like a CSS issue
[11:10:50] <jedimind> you might have some rule set that's overwriting whatever default styles are set for .ui-dialog-titlebar
[11:11:11] <aple> jedimind: I don't though :(
[11:11:15] <jedimind> aple, setup a test case / link to your site, and ask in #css
[11:11:19] <aple> I'm pretty good at CSS, it's not that.
[11:11:22] <jedimind> you must, otherwise it wouldn't be that tall :)
[11:11:35] <jedimind> it doesnt have to be a rule you set for that specific class it could be cascading from something else
[11:11:44] <Dual_Detroit> My keyboards are large; my Javascripts are in charge!
[11:11:45] <aple> jedimind: http://pressedweb.com/samples/swappum click the big red button
[11:12:10] <aple> When I inspect with FF, it's telling me there isn't even padding.
[11:12:19] <aple> Apparently jQueryUI is doing some positioning crap and blowing up
[11:13:13] <Camer0n> anyone?
[11:14:47] <JohnnyDavidson> can you calculate angles of a triangle
[11:15:04] <Camer0n> oh it works now
[11:15:06] <JohnnyDavidson> if you know the length of the lines?
[11:15:09] <Camer0n> nm
[11:15:45] <jedimind> aple, i stand corrected ... but ... tahts fucking bizarre
[11:15:57] <jedimind> there's no javascript that's doing it, there's no css style that's doing it
[11:16:05] <JohnnyDavidson> oops wrong channel
[11:16:10] <jedimind> if you remove the contents of the ui-dialog-titlebar then it's fine

[11:17:02] <ajpiano> pachet, pm me when you're stopped flooding, sorry about that
[11:17:35] <jedimind> awww it looks like he was just starting the whole document with inline styles
[11:17:39] <jedimind> now i want to know the rest
[11:23:59] <g0bl1n> I have a get $.ajax call that receives a PDF file. What should I insert in the success callback so that the browser opens it ?
[11:24:33] <CantUnplug> gObl1n: on the server side, if you push the right headers, browser will open /download automatically
[11:25:10] <g0bl1n> CantUnplug, seems to be ok, let me recheck
[11:25:36] <CantUnplug> g0bl1n: http://www.ryboe.com/tutorials/php-headers-force-download
[11:25:49] <CantUnplug> just as example.
[11:25:49] <g0bl1n> CantUnplug, the type is application/pdf
[11:25:58] <CantUnplug> header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary");
[11:26:13] <CantUnplug> and dispostion: attachment..
[11:26:25] <ryrych> hi
[11:26:33] <g0bl1n> CantUnplug, ok, thanks, let me check again :-)
[11:27:57] <ryrych> I know infamous ie’s catching problem, but I think it would be a good idea to catch large images in normal browsers, wouldn't it? Can jQuery address this issue for ie7?
[11:28:48] <ryrych> jQuery handles many quirks but is this one addressed?
[11:28:51] <CantUnplug> G0bl1n: this is php.. has exception for MSIE.. http://pastebin.com/QDy060iF
[11:29:15] <erichynds> ryrych: wat?
[11:30:14] <ryrych> erichynds: I mean problems with .load on images in ie7
[11:30:43] <erichynds> ryrych: https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[11:30:43] <g0bl1n> CantUnplug, thanks, still checking
[11:32:14] <pachet> sorry for flooding :{ i have a big paste button under my desk, sometimes my knee brushes it
[11:33:37] <ryrych> erichynda: thanks
[11:35:29] <g0bl1n> CantUnplug, if I paste the link to the browser url, it downloads the PDF. If I get it via Ajax call, nothing happens. It only has the Content-type: application/pdf header. Is this the problem for the Ajax ?
[11:35:45] <CantUnplug> pastebin?
[11:36:00] <g0bl1n> yes
[11:36:02] <g0bl1n> 1 sec
[11:38:54] <tgodar> so, jQuery has serialize() but no unserialize()?
[11:40:10] <g0bl1n> CantUnplug, http://pastebin.com/4RcN8CU6
[11:40:32] <cognitived> how can i apply an effect to multiple elements? http://jsfiddle.net/U3wgB/
[11:40:50] <g0bl1n> CantUnplug, the GET is well executed in the server, I can see it in the logs
[11:41:04] <CantUnplug> ah, i see it..  im doign same thing in app  im workign on
[11:41:13] <CantUnplug> ran into same issue, forgot that i went about a different way
[11:41:16] <g0bl1n> CantUnplug, Chrome tells me it receives the pdf, but won't show it
[11:41:18] <CantUnplug> instead of getting..
[11:41:33] <CantUnplug> window.location.href = '/files/get_file_download/'+$('#download_id').val();
[11:41:39] <g0bl1n> ah ok
[11:41:42] <CantUnplug> do a window.loaction.herf to the download url
[11:41:46] <CantUnplug> it forces download
[11:41:54] <CantUnplug> instead fo getting with ajax
[11:41:59] <CantUnplug> t wont releaod or chang eurl
[11:42:03] <g0bl1n> ok, will try that
[11:42:05] <g0bl1n> thanks
[11:42:44] <g0bl1n> CantUnplug, my problem is that I can't do error management with that :-)
[11:42:54] <pachet> tgodar: JSON.parse()? ;o
[11:42:57] <pachet> ecma5
[11:43:14] <CantUnplug> the download url is a script.. not a file
[11:43:17] <g0bl1n> Ajax call allow to manage success/error callbacks :-)
[11:43:49] <CantUnplug> the script does another round of auth/errors/and pushes
[11:43:55] <lekefly_> Anyone that could help me with this.. im getting a error on (line 110) http://pastebin.com/6Upxka12 i can pm site.. : )
[11:45:26] <tgodar> pachet: guess what I'm really looking for is a urldecode method... To undecode the string returned from a .serialize()
[11:46:41] <cognitived> how can i apply an effect to multiple elements? i know $('.one, .two').animate() works, but I already have the elements stored in a variable. see: http://jsfiddle.net/U3wgB/
[11:47:01] <tgodar> ahh, decodeURIComponent() is what I want.  jQuery has atrophied my brain
[11:48:15] <pachet> was just about to post it ;D
[11:48:23] <mbroadst> does anyone in here use DataTables?
[11:48:44] <kborchers> cognitived: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/U3wgB/1/
[11:49:18] <tgodar> mbroadst: evaluated it
[11:50:31] <mbroadst> tgodar: having a lot of trouble over here getting the columns to resize properly.. seems like its a nagging issue for a number of users
[11:50:46] <mbroadst> also looks like if I want to get questions answered quickly I need to pay for support ;)
[11:51:11] <cognitived> kborchers: does that tie any other related effects together?
[11:51:26] <tgodar> mbroadst: on resize of table?
[11:51:46] <mbroadst> tgodar: http://datatables.net/forums/discussion/6781/column-header-size#Item_1
[11:51:49] <larzen-wrk1> i have an interesting question. I have a call back function that passes an object into it. Inside of the inline function, there is a getJSON call that populates the elements of that array. The problem is, i never see the values!!! I can see that the JSON returns them... any ideas on how to handle this??
[11:51:58] <kborchers> cognitived: not sure what you mean
[11:52:27] <cognitived> n/m…thanks. this will work
[11:53:48] <tgodar> mbroadst: have you tried explicit widths?  either with CSS or... 'swidth:' ?
[11:54:28] <mbroadst> tgodar: yes, that is the only way to get close to what I want. but that is not ideal, I can't possibly anticipate the widest width for all systems/all browsers/all data
[11:54:57] <CantUnplug> mbroadst: calculate it on fly
[11:55:11] <tgodar> so you want to make the thing not wrap ever?  making a wide grid and having scrolling?
[11:55:23] <mbroadst> tgodar: yes exactly
[11:55:26] <tgodar> ie. col width is width of longest content?
[11:55:33] <mbroadst> yes
[11:56:02] <tgodar> yikes, no idea.  Then you have to worry about things like font / zoom , etc.  Not easy
[11:56:05] <mbroadst> CantUnplug: as in figure out how to overload their draw method and resize it then?
[11:56:55] <CantUnplug> i believe (its been a while since looking at datatables) - there is a complete event you can subscribe to
[11:57:12] <CantUnplug> basically a resize function you call on complete
[11:57:48] <ryrych> erichynds: I'd like to use it on one images, so what do you think of it? http://pastie.org/2607049
[11:57:51] <CantUnplug> just an idea.. i havnt done it or anything
[11:58:01] <mbroadst> CantUnplug: hm there seems to be a method "fnAdjustColumnSizing" but its not an event per se
[11:58:19] <mbroadst> ok, well the basic idea is probably right, I'll look and see if I can figure that out
[12:00:51] <EyePulp> yo ho ho
[12:00:59] <caaakeeey> hey, whats the best way to minify js when i pull it from git on production?
[12:01:00] <BinaryKitten> and a bottle of rum
[12:01:31] <ryrych> caaakeeey: yahoo minifier?
[12:01:33] <BinaryKitten> caaakeeey create a production branch and then make a build script for it
[12:01:43] <EyePulp> I'm making a jsonp call to a site, and getting back {"foo": null, "bar": null} -- safari is choking on it, giving me a parse error.  what gives?
[12:01:54] <BinaryKitten> once you have your scripts "minified" then commit to the production branch
[12:02:04] <EyePulp> it's double quoted keys...
[12:02:22] <ryrych> erichynda: ? :)
[12:02:25] <BinaryKitten> EyePulp check for whitespace
[12:02:38] <caaakeeey> right so youre essentially saying do the minifcation dev side rather than production side
[12:02:55] <caaakeeey> and remember to run the build script
[12:03:10] <BinaryKitten> caaakeeey yes, or even build it into the build script
[12:03:31] <BinaryKitten> otherwise you can't be sure that of the code on the server
[12:03:43] <SkyFlyer> has anyone seen a gallery rotator like this:::  http://i53.tinypic.com/nynbd.jpg  and know where i can download the plugin???
[12:04:04] <caaakeeey> BinaryKitten, yeah that sounds good, but surely it still depends on you remembering to run the build script - whats thebest way to automate it
[12:04:11] <EyePulp> BinaryKitten: whitespace where?
[12:04:16] <EyePulp> outside the object?
[12:04:23] <caaakeeey> and even so, whats the best minifer to use locally - sorry for being so newbish
[12:04:27] <johnywp> running two versions of jquery through this code http://pastebin.com/psBcvNi7 - then instead of using $, i use j1a2a3 for all the functions/scripts that need to use the old jquery version, and I was hoping to use jQuery for those that need the new version, but jQuery doesn't work
[12:05:13] <BinaryKitten> EyePulp in the output
[12:05:28] <BinaryKitten> if there is whitespace outside the {} it will fail to parse
[12:05:39] <BinaryKitten> caaakeeey look into git hooks
[12:06:25] <BinaryKitten> you can hook into it, check the commit message and then build
[12:06:51] <BinaryKitten> like have a command inthe commit message like #Build_version
[12:06:53] <BinaryKitten> or something
[12:07:00] <BinaryKitten> but that's more for another channel
[12:07:13] <caaakeeey> yeah
[12:07:17] <caaakeeey> and the best minifer?
[12:07:23] <BinaryKitten> there is none
[12:07:41] <BinaryKitten> find one you're comfortable with, one you know the settings for
[12:07:55] <BinaryKitten> as what's good for 1 script can completely break another
[12:08:11] <caaakeeey> ok how about an easy to use safe one to start with? :P
[12:08:23] <solars> whats recommended to create tagclouds, out of a given collection? (e.g. coming from rails)
[12:08:35] <BinaryKitten> google closure compiler
[12:08:45] <BinaryKitten> caaakeeey that works
[12:09:16] <EyePulp> BinaryKitten: yeah - no whitespace being served outside the {}
[12:09:19] <EyePulp> =\

[12:34:21] <jedimind> have you never downloaded anything from any site ?

[12:37:36] <johnywp> in IE - it works on FF or chrome
[12:37:57] <Kit-10> johnywp   use noConflict
[12:37:58] <jedimind> why do you have two versions of jquery?
[12:38:03] <Kit-10> load old 1st  ..
[12:38:40] <johnywp> that's what I am doing
[12:38:57] <johnywp> i have 2 versions because i am using a jquery plugin that won't work with the new version
[12:39:36] <libcbn> where can I find good documentation on jquery-ui objetcs, like ui.panel. ui.atbs, etc?
[12:40:02] <jedimind> doesnt it stand to reason to try to find a better pl ugin that does work? instead of fucking around with noconflict, and forcing people to download an extra 50k ?
[12:40:29] <ajpiano> libcbn: if you look at the jqueryui docs on docs.jquery.com they are better documented there - http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs
[12:41:18] <johnywp> it would... but i couldn't find any other plugin to do what i am trying to do, and also, i have used this plugin in so many places on the site, so i would have to change all of them if i change the plugin
[12:41:50] <pachet> is ie's cute tendency to error out when you pass invalid markup to innerHTML based on doctype ;o
[12:41:59] <jedimind> whats the plugin out of curiosity
[12:42:18] <johnywp> custom made
[12:43:13] <Funkster_1> evening all
[12:43:56] <caaakeeey> anyone have any experience with closurecompiler - how do i easily specify all the js files in a directory?
[12:44:10] <libcbn> ajpiano: hoping for more than is there, like what other attributes exists besides ui.panel.id
[12:44:55] <ajpiano> libcbn: it's a jquery object at that point
[12:44:58] <ajpiano> libcbn: console.dir is your friend
[12:46:24] <tgodar> ever start to make use of a plugin and the realize it really serves no purpose and doesn't actually offer anything useful?  I am looking at you http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jquery-framedialog
[12:46:48] <enjoycrf> hey ajpiano
[12:47:01] <enjoycrf> i am able to avoid using .live
[12:47:06] <enjoycrf> or .delegate
[12:47:15] <Kit-10> lol
[12:47:20] <enjoycrf> just by placing the events properly
[12:47:33] * Kit-10 offers enjoycrf for a hi-5
[12:47:34] <enjoycrf> thats better right
[12:47:35] <libcbn> ajpiano: perfect. thx
[12:47:42] <enjoycrf> than using .live
[12:47:51] <txt23> In this case (http://pastebin.com/pXDadh0M)  the download would start twice if you click on the link instead of waiting. How can you make sure if that if you have clicked on the link the later on download would not start?
[12:47:53] <enjoycrf> yey
[12:48:35] <Kit-10> txt set a flag
[12:48:35] <enjoycrf> hi5
[12:48:38] <Kit-10> check the flag
[12:48:47] <Kit-10> if no flag then direct to download
[12:48:50] <txt23> jedimind: I was talking about this one http://pastebin.com/pXDadh0M
[12:49:02] <txt23> jedimind: In that case the download would start twice
[12:49:11] <EMKO> http://pastebin.com/bhLhf62s CKEDITOR.replace( '2' ); how do i make this work with the page variable ? only seems to work if i manuly put in an id
[12:50:08] <DragonZ> txt23- normally the auto one wont start because the person has JS turned off anyhow, if they click the link early and JS is enabled, you could just cancel that timer you set
[12:50:41] <jedimind> most sites dont care about that though, even the big ones
[12:50:51] <jedimind> if you click it and the automated download starts, you get 2 downloads, you cancel one
[12:50:52] <DragonZ> i see the double dialog behavior on big sites anyhow
[12:50:53] <jedimind> it's not the end of the world
[12:50:58] <jedimind> yeah
[12:51:00] <DragonZ> click the link early, u still get the auto prompt later
[12:51:27] <txt23> DragonZ: I think that could be annoying to some suers
[12:51:46] <DragonZ> the ppl who find it annoying know what to do with the extra dialog
[12:51:54] <DragonZ> its the ppl who are confused by it who you should worry abt lol
[12:52:00] <jedimind> (like complain about it)
[12:52:29] <jedimind> realistically speaking, it's not a problem, sourceforge, who gets millions of downloads daily, doesnt have the logic you speak of
[12:52:31] <jedimind> and noone cares
[12:52:33] <txt23> DragonZ: lol but I ran into a solution for this once and then I forgot to save that code.
[12:52:55] <DragonZ> personally i wouldnt dwell on it much, like jedi said, that behavior is all over the place
[12:53:03] <DragonZ> in fact i've never seen anything but that behavior
[12:53:09] <cakehero> Anyone know the name for this type of menu: http://cl.ly/2e231Y0r2a0A2s28233y
[12:53:24] <jedimind> dropdown menu?
[12:53:43] <jedimind> or a "confusing" menu
[12:53:45] <CantUnplug> its just a div in the li
[12:53:46] <DragonZ> lol
[12:53:56] <cakehero> jedimind heh
[12:54:17] <jedimind> "needlessly complicated menu" or NCM as the kids commonly refer to
[12:54:29] <CantUnplug> http://designm.ag/inspiration/mega-menus/
[12:54:56] <CantUnplug> amazingly - they all seem to hinder usability equally
[12:55:23] <jedimind> MEGA MENU !!!! DUNdundudndunnnnnn
[12:55:27] <jedimind> that was the superhero sound
[12:55:29] <cakehero> CantUnplug jedimind  yeah i'm there, mega menu
[12:58:40] <cakehero> So are you guys totally jealous or what
[13:00:26] <jedimind> of you ?
[13:01:16] <CantUnplug> you know you are in bad shape when you troll irc looking for self esteem boosts
[13:01:43] <jedimind> in my defense i dont have to troll long ?
[13:02:06] <kanzie> Im trying to find the unit-tests for jQuery…seems the latest one I can find is for 1.3rc2 at view.jquery.com/tags/
[13:06:56] <evilyoda> anybody here have any experiences (good or bad) with jqPlot? I'm looking for a charts library and would like one that uses jQuery, but I don't want to get stuck with a dud
[13:07:42] <kanzie> evilyoda: I have used a few different ones to test them all and some really good ones exist at a license-fee but to be honest I have always been happiest with Flot
[13:08:26] <kanzie> the license-ones are usually a little easier to implement and comes with prettier graphs out of the box
[13:08:40] <evilyoda> kanzie: so what did you like about Flot? Did you miss anything vs. the for-pay ones?
[13:08:49] <kanzie> give flot a try
[13:08:56] <kanzie> I like that it is very robust
[13:09:02] <kanzie> quite actively discussed
[13:09:10] <kanzie> and has a very scientific approach to the topic
[13:09:35] <kanzie> it is easy on CPU
[13:09:48] <kanzie> and was a breeze to get up and running for me
[13:09:58] <kanzie> I haven't done anything super-complex with it though
[13:10:39] <kanzie> Im going to implement scaling and data points over 3 days now so it will really put it to the test. Im polling a server every second for new values, put them on a stack and use the stack to render the graph
[13:13:58] <kanzie> is there unit-tests being done on jQuery passed 1.3.2?
[13:15:21] <JohnnyDavidson> What's a good way to benchmark with javascript?
[13:16:21] <hadees> I'm trying to click a link on the parent iframe, any idea why this isn't working? $('#next_btn', window.parent.document).click();
[13:16:29] <ngharo> JohnnyDavidson: jsperf.com is pretty cool
[13:16:30] <hadees> they are both on the same domain
[13:19:41] <pachet> JohnnyDavidson: http://benchmarkjs.com/ (which i think jsperf uses)
[13:19:58] <sphinxxx> im getting confused with all these scroll plugins: localscroll, scrollto, easing
[13:20:01] <sphinxxx> what do i really need?
[13:23:03] <larzen-wrk1> Can anyone explain to my why popupDetails has no data assigned to it? http://codepad.org/AJia84UL
[13:23:42] <racquad> hi guys, I have a simple question. I have a jQuery trigger assigned to a class, something like $('.class').click(.... and so on. the point is, this link is on a table that is refreshed. When the table refreshes, the trigger stop working. Any idea?
[13:24:13] <larzen-wrk1> racquad: because your event is lost
[13:24:48] <iPhone4G> Hi all, i have a question regarding jquery uis tabs. I load the contents with ajax as mentioned in the docs. Is there some way to get a spinner or something like that working in the Tab until the real content is finished loading?
[13:24:56] <racquad> larzen-wrk1, yes, that's the "why". I want to know how can I solve this
[13:25:09] <kborchers> ?delegate @ racquad
[13:25:09] <bot-t> racquad, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[13:25:31] <tgodar> how would i go about finding a span with a given string for its .text()?  Do I need to loop over the spans or can 'find' do it?
[13:27:00] <racquad> kborchers, so I should specify the delegate to the command that controls the paginate function on my table, for example?
[13:27:29] <pachet> ?:contains() @ tgodar
[13:27:30] <bot-t> tgodar, :contains() Selector - Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[13:29:59] <tgodar> thanks!
[13:31:41] <kborchers> racquad: you would do something like $(parentOfElementWith.class).delegate(".class", "click", function(event){...});
[13:32:22] <amijay> Will somebody please help me lose my javirginity?
[13:34:40] <amijay> I am ready to learn how to use java
[13:34:57] <ajpiano> amijay: i think you're in the wrong chanel
[13:35:19] <amijay> Jquery is a java library...no?
[13:35:27] <kborchers> javascript
[13:35:30] <amijay> !

[13:39:18] <mooKoo> i have a question regarding jquery uis tabs. I load the contents with ajax as mentioned in the docs. Is there some way to get a spinner or something like that working in the Tab until the real content is finished loading?
[13:39:23] <kborchers> and reading back on your question, i believe there is a spinner option in tabs that will help you
[13:39:30] <kborchers> ?ui.tabs @ mooKoo
[13:39:30] <bot-t> mooKoo, Tabs are generally used to break content into multiple sections that can be swapped to save space. http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/

[13:45:41] <blez> hello
[13:45:54] <blez> I need a plugin for jquery to make such list
[13:45:56] <blez> http://www.wintellect.com/CS/blogs/rrobinson/WindowsLiveWriter/AnotherAnnoyingUIRant2_1490A/DefaultlListBox_2.jpg
[13:46:54] <enjoycrf> is there a way yet to make the file browse input look better?
[14:07:05] <Meekohi> Hey all. I have an position-animation that needs to be interupted and sent to a different location. Is there anyway to make the transition smooth, as opposed to stopping and starting the new animation?
[14:09:48] <Paul_B_Hartzog> you could try easing it
[14:10:24] <Meekohi> Paul_B_Hartzog: you mean like setup a custom easing for each event, based on the current tragectory?
[14:10:29] <k776> I'm looking for a good date and time picker. Anyone recommend one?
[14:11:18] <Paul_B_Hartzog> vector 1 could ease into a stop and vector 2 could ease at start
[14:11:29] <Paul_B_Hartzog> if it is changing direction
[14:12:37] <macmartine> I'm using the query date picker and trying to figure out how to highlight the whole week for whatever day is selected. Any ideas?
[14:12:42] <macmartine> *jquery datepicker
[14:12:47] <Meekohi> Paul_B_Hartzog: I'd rather have vector1 be the current vector, and vector2 ease into a stop.
[14:12:53] <Meekohi> Paul_B_Hartzog: but how would I figure out the current vector?
[14:13:11] <sphinxxx> what is the diff between localscroll and scrollto plugins?
[14:13:51] <Paul_B_Hartzog> not sure what you are trying to do. i thought you had a vector 1 that you were interrupting to change direction to vector 2'
[14:15:45] <Meekohi> Paul_B_Hartzog: Let's say we are in the middle of an animation from A to B -- I want to change the final destination to C without having to come to a complete stop.
[14:16:43] <Paul_B_Hartzog> ok so an interrupt will make a sharp turn
[14:16:47] <Paul_B_Hartzog> you want something smoother
[14:16:59] <Paul_B_Hartzog> right?
[14:18:04] <Meekohi> Paul_B_Hartzog: Exactly.
[14:18:14] <Meekohi> I was using clearQueue() before
[14:18:28] <Paul_B_Hartzog> not familiar with clearQueue()
[14:19:16] <Paul_B_Hartzog> but a procedure would be to decide how many alternate vectors you want to use, and then calculate an endpoint for each (even though your object will never reach any of them)
[14:19:34] <Paul_B_Hartzog> except the last one
[14:20:12] <Paul_B_Hartzog> you could figure out those points by doing a X,Y coordinate difference on the actual final endpoint and the location of the object when the interrupt begins
[14:20:17] <mikeric> i'm trying to reset the contents of an element by calling $('#days').html(''), but i'm getting the following error: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'related' of undefined"
[14:20:24] <mikeric> any ideas on what may cause this?
[14:20:43] <mikeric> some notes: it only happens when the content contains a rendered backbone view.
[14:21:18] <Meekohi> Paul_B_Hartzog: It sounds like this basically reduces to doing physics calclulations by hand. I'm surprised jQuery doesn't have something for this built in.
[14:21:33] <Paul_B_Hartzog> heh
[14:21:59] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i mentioned easing because if you could do easing on 2 vectors at the same time, you would get a curved trajectory
[14:22:11] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i'd make a test page and try it
[14:23:10] <Paul_B_Hartzog> so if vector1 went slow->fast, and vector2 went fast->slow, you'd get a nice hyperbolic curve
[14:23:24] <widoz> for a latest jquery link?
[14:24:53] <PhanLord> is there a better event then onLoad event for images (loaded dynamically from javascript), safari seems to throw it too early before image is decoded/loaded completly and its not ready for display yet
[14:31:41] <enjoycrf> yoyoyo
[14:32:02] <enjoycrf> is there a way to open input type=file with another button?
[14:32:18] <Kit-10> depends on the browser
[14:32:34] <enjoycrf> or link
[14:32:41] <Kit-10> try trigger('click')
[14:32:49] <Kit-10> or .focus();
[14:33:14] <enjoycrf> $mylink.click( open $(input file
[14:33:17] <enjoycrf> ?
[14:41:20] <winux> how do i break out of a .each loop from inside a function within the loop?
[14:42:05] <winux> ie: $.each(parseLocations, function(field, value){ timer = setInterval(function(){ return false; }); }); doesnt seem to work
[14:44:10] <jgspratt> I am trying to use http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation to validate an email address, but the validation is not firing.
[14:44:30] <jgspratt> I can click the submit button and I am not stopped from not entering an email address
[14:44:56] <jgspratt> the thing is, I have it setup identically to another page
[14:45:13] <jgspratt> firebug gives no errors
[14:45:25] <jgspratt> page is at http://www.dordt.edu/cgi-bin/admissions/financial_aid/estimator/index.dev.pl?step=2&agree=1
[14:45:56] <dabear> winux: that is just wrong on so many levels.
[14:46:39] <winux> dabear: lol
[14:46:52] <dabear> that is no laughing matter
[14:46:59] <jgspratt> any clues?
[14:47:38] <Jayflux> jgspratt try attatching something else to your handler like an alert to see whether its that or your plugin
[14:48:02] <k776> I'm looking for a good date and time picker. Anyone recommend one?
[14:48:05] <winux> dabear: relax, it's not on the spaceshuttle
[14:48:05] <dabear> winux: 1) setinterval requires a second parameter specifying the interval. 2) the func provided to setinterval is delayed, so it will be run after .each is completed. you cannot return from something that is already completed
[14:49:03] <winux> dabear: ah, i forgot the interval.. it's in the original code .. i condensed it a bit for here
[14:49:20] <jgspratt> Jayflux: I stuck an alert in the (document).ready and nothing happened when I loaded the page.
[14:49:27] <winux> dabear: but i see what you are saying on point 2
[14:49:39] <ajpiano> furthermore, a function can only end itself... if you pass a function to another function inside of the first function, the passed function return's value doesn't get passed up to the function that originally passed it
[14:49:39] <ajpiano> lol
[14:50:06] <jgspratt> Jayflux: was it supposed to?
[14:50:23] <winux> ajpiano: yea, that was my first thought
[14:50:31] <Jayflux> yes is jquery installed properly jgspratt?
[14:50:40] <Jayflux> you checked its there
[14:50:56] <cbcwebdev> are there any pagination plugins which don't impose html restrictions, or allow for a rendering template to be configured? I've played with a few plugins which work great - but they're too restricting in terms of customization.
[14:51:09] <jgspratt> Jayflux: yes.  if I put my validation before jquery is loaded, I get the warning from firebug
[14:51:26] <dabear> Yo dawg, I put a function inside your function so you can run while you run
[14:51:29] <dabear> or something
[14:52:21] <jgspratt> Jayflux: when I put that on the page that has the validation, it doesn't show me the alert either
[14:53:23] <jgspratt> wait
[14:53:29] <jgspratt> it stopped working on the one that it works on
[14:53:37] <winux> dabear: jBonics
[14:55:11] <dabear> jbonics??
[14:56:01] <macmartine> anyone know how i can unbind hover in query ui, such as those handlers auto-added for the datepicker?
[14:58:20] <jgspratt> Jayflux: ok, I fixed that.  I get the alert on the one that works and the one that doesn't work
[14:58:25] <jgspratt> but no validation!
[14:58:47] <jgspratt> http://pastebin.com/U6tCsgcE
[15:00:06] <necromancer> it's awesome that $.ajax can take JSON as well as a regular JS object
[15:00:11] <jgspratt> does anyone know how to fix this sillyness?
[15:00:13] <necromancer> in the 'data' param
[15:00:51] <necromancer> jgspratt: yeah first off remove the "\" wtf is that for?
[15:01:00] <jgspratt> this is in perl
[15:01:26] <necromancer> jgspratt: oh ok. well your rules are malformed
[15:01:32] <jgspratt> oh!
[15:01:33] <necromancer> rules is an object and has nested objects inside it
[15:01:35] <jgspratt> how to fix?
[15:01:42] <necromancer> you can only have 1 rule for email
[15:01:49] <necromancer> so you need to nest those two rules in another object
[15:01:55] <necromancer> email: { required: true, email: true }
[15:02:05] <necromancer> email: 'required' and email: { required: true } are the same thing
[15:02:08] <jgspratt> no quotes """?
[15:02:17] <necromancer> nah true & false are keywods
[15:02:30] <necromancer> validate allows you to pass an object OR a string, depending on whether you want to pass multiple rules or just one
[15:02:35] <necromancer> makes things a little easier to type
[15:04:00] <jgspratt> necromancer: http://pastebin.com/nuFARyDm ?
[15:04:26] <necromancer> now you got it :)
[15:04:37] <necromancer> although now you need a submitHandler
[15:04:42] <necromancer> go read the docs for how to make one of those
[15:04:46] <jgspratt> This field is required. XD
[15:04:48] <necromancer> the jquery.form plugin might also come in handy
[15:05:48] <Xiaoxiao> hi necromancer, can you help me ?
[15:05:51] <hadees> I'm trying to click a link on the parent iframe, any idea why this isn't working? $('#next_btn', window.parent.document).click();
[15:06:00] <hadees> they are both on the same domain
[15:08:13] <necromancer> Xiaoxiao: only if you ask your question
[15:08:20] <necromancer> (don't pm me though)
[15:09:33] <enjoycrf> hi
[15:09:58] <Xiaoxiao> I used jquery treeview ( http://jquery.bassistance.de/treeview/demo/ ). It work fire with HTML code
[15:10:00] <enjoycrf> how do i open input file dialog w another btn
[15:11:00] <Kit-10> enjoycrf didn't i answer that one

[15:11:25] <Xiaoxiao> not show the tree graphic
[15:11:33] <Kit-10> depends on the browser
[15:11:35] <Kit-10> try trigger('click')
[15:11:37] <Kit-10> or .focus();
[15:11:37] <cbcwebdev> is there a table / pagination plugin for datagrids which doesn't impose an HTML structure?
[15:11:51] <enjoycrf> what do u mean triger click
[15:12:00] <enjoycrf> or focus
[15:12:09] <Kit-10> targetItem.trigger('click')
[15:12:14] <Kit-10> targetItem.focus();
[15:12:18] <Kit-10> depending on the browser etc
[15:12:22] <enjoycrf> ah
[15:12:35] <Kit-10> eg safari fires on element focus
[15:12:37] <enjoycrf> ok gona try focus
[15:12:40] <Kit-10> firefox on element click
[15:12:46] <enjoycrf> never used .triger
[15:12:49] <Kit-10> ie doesn't play well
[15:12:57] <Kit-10> trigger triggers the event
[15:15:10] <enjoycrf> whats the best way to hide the <input file
[15:15:20] <Xiaoxiao> hi, can anyone help me ?
[15:15:21] <enjoycrf> display:none;?
[15:15:47] <raven_> ?ask @ Xiaoxiao
[15:15:47] <bot-t> Xiaoxiao, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:17:12] <enjoycrf> raven ur a jerk
[15:17:17] <enjoycrf> _
[15:17:30] <Xiaoxiao> I used jquery treeview ( http://jquery.bassistance.de/treeview/demo/ ). It work fire with HTML code but if I respond all code from web server. It can't show the tree graphic
[15:17:30] <enjoycrf> i can help u xiao
[15:17:48] <Xiaoxiao> just show html code
[15:18:12] <enjoycrf> never used that plugin
[15:18:18] <enjoycrf> sawry
[15:18:44] <enjoycrf> but its $('div').html(ur_html);
[15:18:48] <Xiaoxiao> I think that I must call some function to make the tree
[15:19:23] <raven_> enjoycrf you are so kind :s
[15:19:48] <mikeric> i've run into an interesting problem with using backbone in conjunction with jQuery.event.drag. you can't remove the dom elements that have drag events binded to them in the backbone view.. the following error is what occurs: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'related' of undefined.
[15:19:54] <mikeric> any ideas what may cause this?
[15:19:58] <macmartine> I'm trying to make the datepicker NOT highlight the selected day. If I unbind the mouseover it does what I want in query 1.5.2 but not in 1.6.2 http://jsfiddle.net/YvFcJ/1/ Any idea why?
[15:20:17] <mikeric> there are plenty of other events that can be binder to elements and still be removed.. but not the drag/drop events.
[15:20:24] <macmartine> I'm referring to the hover highlight, sorry. Not the 'selected'
[15:20:34] <mikeric> sorry, not drop.. it's only affected by drag.
[15:21:32] <james13433> is there away to check that no confilct is working?
[15:23:24] <Xiaoxiao> enjoycrf, can you suggest to me any treeview plugin ?
[15:23:35] <enjoycrf> i have no clue
[15:26:58] <enjoycrf> thats the downside of using too many plugins
[15:27:13] <devinrolsen> anyone know how to turn off Chrome's dimension tool tip when you inspect elements or hovering elements in the dev tools? Really gets in the way.
[15:28:40] <Xiaoxiao> ok, thanks enjoycrf
[15:28:49] <AuroraX> when i call $.ajax i use dataType: "text" but still it complains about malformed xml, why?
[15:28:58] <Xiaoxiao> I will search another plugin
[15:32:02] <devinrolsen> #chromium
[15:32:12] <multipass> how can i check when a div goes from display:none to display:block?
[15:32:14] <AuroraX> when i call $.ajax i use dataType: "text" but still it complains about malformed xml, why?
[15:36:18] <macmartine> Here's a puzzler if anyone is up for trying to figure out what the first unbind is doing that the second one isn't: http://jsfiddle.net/YvFcJ/2/
[15:43:30] <BleKohl> What's the difference between x.toArray() and $.makeArray(x) ?
[15:44:39] <cakehero> BleKohl probably nothing
[15:44:53] <BleKohl> I see
[15:44:54] <cakehero> macmartine i accept your challenge
[15:44:58] <cakehero> BleKohl are they both working?
[15:44:59] <macmartine> cakehero: woohoo!
[15:45:04] <BleKohl> Yeah cakehero
[15:45:06] <cakehero> BleKohl IDK about JS but in Perl it's basically the same thing
[15:45:11] <cakehero> but Perl is ghetto-er
[15:45:23] <Kamakazi> they probably result in the same time
[15:45:36] <cakehero> $.makeArray(x) is calling the class function "makeArray" and passing the variable "x" to it
[15:45:48] <BleKohl> Oh
[15:45:52] <BleKohl> Well I like methods better
[15:46:03] <cakehero> x.makeArray() is calling the instance method "makeArray" and 'x' may be passed behind the scenes or automatically or something
[15:46:10] <cakehero> x.makeArray() is more awesome in my opinion
[15:46:17] <BleKohl> In mine too
[15:47:21] <BleKohl> Hm, but what if I have an jQuery array of elements
[15:47:28] <BleKohl> And I want a JS array of their text contents
[15:47:54] <cakehero> macmartine clicking the link now
[15:47:59] <macmartine> cakehero: good luck :)
[15:48:16] <Dollz> how to get all <select> menus that are not empty (some option is selected with a non-empty value)
[15:48:22] <cakehero> macmartine whats the problem?
[15:49:09] <cakehero> Dollz $('select').each(function(i, el) { if($(el).val()) { …. do your stuff here } }
[15:49:12] <cakehero> something like that
[15:49:14] <macmartine> cakehero: so, hover over the dates now -- no hover highlight. good! now, comment out one unbind for the other. hover highlights! why?
[15:49:21] <cakehero> k
[15:49:41] <Vespakoen> Hellow sweeties!
[15:50:05] <Dollz> There is no selector like $('input[value!=""]')
[15:50:12] <Dollz> ?
[15:50:54] <Vespakoen> I just got a fantastic idea (i think), in IE6 and in IE7, things work quite differently than we expect, bugs especially, coulnt we make a nice jQuery plugin that helps you track down these bugs?
[15:51:18] <cakehero> macmartine allow me to figure out why
[15:53:56] <NateW> I'm using sortable from jQuery UI, I'm connecting two lists with one element each. How can I make it, so when I move the element from one list to the other, the elements switch lists
[15:54:24] <NateW> hopefully that makes sense
[15:54:39] <cakehero> macmartine not sure
[15:54:46] <macmartine> word
[15:55:12] <cakehero> macmartine it doesn't actually return all the children
[15:55:29] <cakehero> macmartine the source shows it binding the event on button, .ui-datepicker-prev, .ui-datepicker-next, .ui-datepicker-calendar td a
[15:55:36] <cakehero> you could try this
[15:55:40] <cakehero> if you want to be specific
[15:56:20] <cakehero> err, I mean "that"
[15:58:05] <macmartine> cakehero: just tried all those
[15:58:15] <cakehero> macmartine #biwinning?
[15:58:44] <macmartine> cakehero: what?
[15:59:37] <cakehero> macmartine here's the actual source: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/798070045
[16:00:00] <macmartine> cakehero: yeah, i've been looking at that
[16:00:05] <cakehero> macmartine so do what they do
[16:01:34] <caaakeeey> hi im trying to use googles closurebuilder and i get No Closure base.js file found. - any ideas?
[16:03:56] <cakehero> What slideshow plugin should I use for this: http://cl.ly/1a1647211h2p0J1S3H3g
[16:04:09] <ghostx64> caaakeeey: yes
[16:04:24] <ghostx64> there's a Closure base.js file
[16:04:28] <ghostx64> it's missing
[16:04:54] <caaakeeey> ah ok
[16:04:56] <caaakeeey> fixed that one
[16:05:05] <caaakeeey> now is says my namespace is never provided
[16:05:25] <NateW> I'm using sortable from jQuery UI, I'm connecting two lists with one element each. How can I make it, so when I move the element from one list to the other, the elements switch lists?
[16:05:56] <NateW> basically, limiting each list to 1 item
[16:06:02] <ghostx64> yes.
[16:06:10] <ghostx64> your namespace - it needs to be provided.
[16:06:39] <ghostx64> try giving your namespace a name.
[16:06:48] <ghostx64> like bob or frank
[16:06:53] <ghostx64> or stan
[16:06:57] <ghostx64> but not larry
[16:06:59] <Dollz> offtopic:  I'm developing a youtube downloader and converter to iphone,bb , ..etc ... I'm willing to call it youtube sucker. .. is that a good name ? btw: my english is not so good !
[16:07:21] <caaakeeey> i did provide it
[16:07:48] <ghostx64> yes, you did provide it. that is why it says it needs to be provided.
[16:07:56] <ghostx64> it is trying to trick you.
[16:08:14] <caaakeeey> im doing --namespace=x
[16:08:19] <caaakeeey> Name space "x" never provided
[16:08:21] <ghostx64> it is a nigerian scam artist that has infiltrated your computer hoping that you will use your bank account information as your namespace
[16:08:22] <caaakeeey> how do i provide it?
[16:08:43] <ghostx64> look for 'set working directory
[16:09:40] <caaakeeey> oh i see
[16:09:44] <caaakeeey> i need to go up one level
[16:09:49] <caaakeeey> fml
[16:09:53] <ghostx64> once u find it, then post your bank account number into this chatroom
[16:10:03] <caaakeeey> i dont have a bank account
[16:10:07] <caaakeeey> i only used sexual favours
[16:10:18] <ghostx64> good. then the nigerians will leave you alone
[16:10:33] <caaakeeey> maybe i dont want that
[16:10:36] <huntedmitch> Hey guys. When I am tracking mousemove is there a way to know that the mouse has left the window?
[16:10:37] <caaakeeey> im partial for a hung black guy
[16:11:11] <huntedmitch> Wow, I joined at the wrong time
[16:11:38] <Blaster> hey how would you loop over each TD inside a TR?
[16:11:38] <Dollz> lol , it's the wrong room
[16:11:50] <caaakeeey> its still saying its not provided :/
[16:12:00] <caaakeeey> what does it have to reference?
[16:12:17] <caaakeeey> a directory thats within my current working directory?
[16:12:18] <Dollz> offtopic:  I'm developing a youtube downloader and converter to iphone,bb , ..etc ... I'm willing to call it youtube sucker. .. is that a good name ? btw: my english is not so good !
[16:13:44] <Dollz> ANY HELP WILL BE FUC***N APPRECIATED !!!!!
[16:14:44] <huntedmitch> hahahhaha
[16:16:06] <Dave_Stein> Blaser: $('#my_tr').find('td').each
[16:16:14] <Dave_Stein> Blaster: $('#my_tr').find('td').each
[16:16:30] <Dollz> Dave_Stein: $('table td').each() is shorter
[16:16:52] <Dave_Stein> Dollz: Since he said each td inside a TR I assumed he meant a specific tr
[16:17:08] <Dave_Stein> Dollz: but if it's all TDs that is def better
[16:17:20] <Dollz> Dave_Stein: then $('td','#tr').each() is shorter
[16:17:36] <Dave_Stein> Dollz: I believe using context liek that is slower
[16:17:43] <caaakeeey> hi im trying to use googles closurebuilder and i get Namespace never provided. - any ideas?
[16:17:56] <Dave_Stein> Dollz: doing that is making jquery look at second param and then calling find automatically
[16:18:05] <Dave_Stein> instead of just calling it yourself
[16:18:29] <Dollz> Dave_Stein: I'm saving my self some key stokes , let jquery do the dirty things
[16:18:57] <Dave_Stein> Dollz: you are correct in 99% of apps but sometimets it adds up for me so i keep it like that for all my apps for good habit :)
[16:19:08] <Dave_Stein> Dollz: esp if youre doing things ondrag, i just always go for fastest
[16:19:09] <Dollz> Dave_Stein: eventually , it's the user PC that will be fuc*ed
[16:19:21] <Dave_Stein> Dollz: I don't have that luxury to eff em :)
[16:19:55] <Dollz> I do :p
[16:20:05] <Dave_Stein> well f you haha
[16:20:29] <Dollz> ok !
[16:21:18] <Dollz> off-damn-topic:  I'm developing a youtube downloader and converter to iphone,bb , ..etc ... I'm willing to call it youtube sucker. .. is that a good name ? btw: my english is not so good !

[16:21:30] <ColKurtz> lol
[16:21:42] <Dave_Stein> oi oi oi
[16:22:09] <r1ch> does anyone know of a jquery ui theme around for a facebook application?
[16:23:28] <r1ch> e.g using it to display custom dialogs like the fb ui call?
[16:23:42] <Dave_Stein> r1ch i dont pay attention to themes so i dunno
[16:24:51] <r1ch> Dave_Stein: just thought try and save myself some time if someones already done the hard work!
[16:25:06] <Dave_Stein> i feel like google would know the answer better than this room
[16:25:12] <Dollz> ColKurtz: does it mean something bad ?
[16:26:00] <Dollz> this room SUCKKKKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[16:27:31] <eddiemonge> wtf Dollz?
[16:27:51] <Dollz> eddiemonge: and you as well
[16:28:07] <Dollz> eddiemonge: sucks too
[16:28:34] <eddiemonge> can someone say /kick?
[16:29:35] <gnarf> Dollz: don't troll :)
[16:30:04] <eddiemonge> gnarf: did i see right that you wont be at the dinner friday?
[16:30:13] <gnarf> eddiemonge: i'll be there
[16:30:23] <gnarf> eddiemonge: am actually already "here"
[16:30:39] <eddiemonge> oh i thought you werent on the "list"
[16:32:35] <huntedmitch> Hey guys, is there an alternative to mouseleave that you can use when mouseleave is acting a bit weird?
[16:32:57] <eddiemonge> weird?
[16:33:12] <huntedmitch> Well, not weird, it just doesn't seem to fire
[16:33:14] <gnarf> eddiemonge: i wasn't on the "list" not really sure why, but hopefully I've corrected that by now....
[16:33:46] <Blaster> is there a way to wait until one AJAX query ends before sending the next?
[16:33:50] <eddiemonge> do you live in boston?
[16:34:03] <eddiemonge> Blaster: you could do it synchronously
[16:34:28] <Blaster> i want it to wait until the first one is done, because i can't fetch data from the server that fast
[16:34:30] <huntedmitch> Blaster: put the second one inside the success method of the first? ;-)
[16:34:37] <Blaster> yeah thats a good idea
[16:34:44] <gnarf> ?ajaxQueue
[16:34:45] <bot-t> jQuery.ajaxQueue - A quick demonstration of a queue for ajax calls using jQuery.Deferred() jQuery.ajax() and .queue() - http://gnarf.net/2011/06/21/jquery-ajaxqueue/
[16:34:59] <huntedmitch> Our that is better :-)
[16:35:05] <gnarf> eddiemonge: nope, i just flew in today
[16:35:15] <gnarf> eddiemonge: sitting at the bocoup loft right now in a meetup
[16:36:16] <eddiemonge> ahh. i feel like im getting in too late by arriving on friday
[16:38:49] <gnarf> eddiemonge: trust me, I'm way early - but the flight was damn cheap :0
[16:38:50] <gnarf> :)
[16:40:07] <ColKurtz> huntedmitch, you could try hoverIntent http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[16:41:11] <huntedmitch> ColKurtz: Good thought but doesn't quite work in this instance
[16:41:23] <huntedmitch> I am using a wrapper for a chromium instance
[16:41:33] <huntedmitch> I think the problem is that it's always reporting a mouse position
[16:41:54] <huntedmitch> Meaning $(document).mouseleave(function(e){ ….. }); never actually fires
[16:42:50] <ColKurtz> chromium instance?
[16:43:40] <huntedmitch> Yeah, it's an app that has Chromium running inside of it
[16:45:59] <eddiemonge> huntedmitch: i dont think thats valid. try using $('body') instead
[16:47:02] <huntedmitch> Same result
[16:49:03] <eddiemonge> so you are trying to determine when the mouse leaves the browser/app?
[16:49:11] <huntedmitch> Yeah
[16:50:17] <eddiemonge> can i ask for what purpose?
[16:50:58] <huntedmitch> Well I have previous and next buttons attached to the right and left hand side of the browser. On load I hide them, then based on which half of the screen the mouse is in I show/hide the appropriate one
[16:51:13] <huntedmitch> But when the mouse leaves they stay shown so I want to track mouse leave and hide both
[16:51:14] <huntedmitch> :-)
[16:52:59] <Dave_Stein> huntedmitch: in regards to what eddiemonge said i think you should do a .hover on body and when it's over body have a class that allows it to be shown and mouseout should remove that class
[16:53:10] <Dave_Stein> huntedmitch: then you can add and remove secondary classes based on if it's on left or right side
[17:02:28] <huntedmitch> Dave_Stein: Yeah, I think you're right
[17:02:34] <huntedmitch> Alas, there is a hover being reported hah
[17:03:05] <Heshanh> can i selecte a inputbox that has a name like this data[TripDate][trip_date] ?
[17:04:08] <Dave_Stein> reported on body when youre off te body?
[17:04:20] <Dave_Stein> Heshanh why would you give such a name
[17:04:56] <Heshanh> cakephp that how it outputs it
[17:05:00] <Dave_Stein> Heshanh I really think you mean to add attributes
[17:05:14] <Dave_Stein> never used cakephp but now i know thats a good reasn never to use it :) CodeIgniter is great
[17:05:26] <Dave_Stein> but sure jquery can do $('[name=thatgarbage]')
[17:05:34] <Heshanh> CI is good bust lacking features for this project
[17:05:47] <Dave_Stein> i wonder if this works
[17:05:53] <Dave_Stein> ?attribute-equals-selector @ Heshanh
[17:05:55] <bot-t> Heshanh, Attribute Equals Selector [name="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value exactly equal to a certain value. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[17:06:32] <huntedmitch> Dave_Stein: So basically when the mouse leaves the browser there is no event being fired, so therefor they just stay shown
[17:06:57] <Dave_Stein> huntedmitch: if you look at mousemove, do the X and Y coordinates stay positive?
[17:07:11] <Heshanh> can i apply datepicker to a class?
[17:07:25] <Dave_Stein> all widgets work on any css selector
[17:07:26] <Heshanh> nvm you cant
[17:07:28] <eddiemonge> Heshanh: thats not really a valid name in html4: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-cdata
[17:07:45] <ColKurtz> I gave CI a shot but it had no template inheritance built in D:
[17:07:57] <Dave_Stein> huntedmitch: actually what am i thinking? if your mouse goes off screen theres no more js being fired
[17:08:11] <Dave_Stein> ColKurtz: You can do $this->load->view in any template page... what is lacking from there?
[17:08:13] <ProLoser|Work> man, designers can be stupid
[17:08:21] <Dave_Stein> ProLoser|Work: correct
[17:08:24] <ProLoser|Work> they were complaining that i was fading in a modal too fast, and asked me to slow it down
[17:08:36] <ProLoser|Work> i didn't pass anything, so it's using the default time (500 ms)
[17:08:45] <AliG1000> How do I send the values from this slider to an external file using AJAX?  http://jsfiddle.net/J9z9D/5/
[17:08:53] <ProLoser|Work> i changed it to 501 and showed it to them, and they were like "AWSOEM that's TOTALLY better thank you SO much"
[17:08:58] <Dave_Stein> huntedmitch: maybe check the coordinates and when they get to a certain edge point like 10px before edge, hide it
[17:09:01] <Heshanh> data[TripDate][trip_date] pretty much save the date to the TripDate table where the field is trip_date with out me doing any code at all. thats why im using it
[17:09:14] <bapi_> http://pastebin.com/UfMvKnfb How can I detect when "user2" is selected?
[17:09:19] <ColKurtz> Dave_Stein, so you have to do something like $this->load->view('header') and $this->load->view('footer') ?
[17:09:48] <Dave_Stein> ColKurtz  oh oh oh i see what you're saying haha we programmed a $this->load->layout
[17:10:05] <Dave_Stein> ColKurtz: so my whole site takes the header and footer the whole time and theres like a $primary_content var that gets filled with the view script
[17:10:14] <Dave_Stein> ColKurtz: doesnt come with CI, but was relatively simple to implement
[17:10:15] <ColKurtz> oh i see
[17:10:24] <Dave_Stein> but still you can do what you said, inside a view script
[17:10:27] <Dave_Stein> i do that for sublayouts
[17:10:43] <ColKurtz> i wanna give lithium a try
[17:10:43] <Dave_Stein> like i have my whole site layout and then the My Account section has a specific header and footer inside the main area, and i do what you pasted for most part
[17:11:03] <Dave_Stein> ColKurtz: we stripped out CI to like <5% of what it is out of box so wouldnt make sense for us to switch now or ever
[17:11:11] <strike> Help me out here? I've no clue what command etc. I am looking for: I have a dynamic DIV-table with 10 divs. Each of them contains different value, and what I want is that when I click one of them --> a box appears which shows the value of the clicked DIV.
[17:11:13] <Dave_Stein> ProLoser|Work that is hilarious
[17:11:30] <Dave_Stein> bapi_ ill gotake a look now
[17:12:06] <Dave_Stein> strike: $('.div').bind( 'click', function( evt ) { console.log( $(evt.target).val())  } );
[17:12:25] <Dave_Stein> or rather $(evt.target).attr( 'value' ) if its a div I would guess
[17:12:33] <Dave_Stein> and then replace console.log with whatever thing that makes a box :)
[17:12:36] <Dave_Stein> maybe fancybox
[17:12:37] <strike> thanks! I'll start debugging those command to know what everything does :]

[17:12:47] <Dave_Stein> ok bapi_ really looking now
[17:13:02] <Dave_Stein> oh ha i read value literaelly but youre prob right in what he meant ColKurtz

[17:15:59] <Guest82178> $("#tweets span").html( $.timeago(new Date(value)) ) - how can i specify the proper value of #tweets span? $("#tweets span").val?
[17:18:41] <ColKurtz> craving boba so hard
[17:19:17] <AliG1000> bapi_:  http://jsfiddle.net/nb8rS/  I changed one of the lines of the HTML to add an 'id' called 'mail'
[17:19:43] <AliG1000> and then listened for any changes in the Javascript
[17:20:25] <hamcore> $("#tweets span").html( $.timeago(new Date(value)) ) - how can i specify the proper value of #tweets span? $("#tweets span").val?
[17:20:43] <hamcore> i want to use $.timeago based upon the proper value of the span
[17:22:36] <AliG1000> bapi_  did it work for you
[17:24:31] <AliG1000> I'm still having problems with my own.  http://jsfiddle.net/J9z9D/5/  The slider works, I get the values pop up in an alert - now how do I send those in a POST to another page via Ajax so that I can update a database?
[17:27:03] <sparuvu> $('ul.jvt-list').live('scroll', function() { console.log("sam"); });
[17:27:10] <sparuvu> the following is not working
[17:27:22] <sparuvu> where am I doing wrong ?
[17:33:36] <robin_sz> I have two <ul> lists ... i want to manipulate an <li> in one list .. removing it, and adding it to the other one
[17:33:50] <robin_sz> sort of .. changing its parent?
[17:34:15] <aple> Hey guys, I'm trying to figure out AJAX. What is passed when you pass "data" as an arg within a success function?
[17:34:43] <aple> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484153/
[17:34:46] <robin_sz> aple, whatever is returned by the AJAX call, usually a JSON object etc
[17:35:00] <aple> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484154/
[17:35:30] <AliG1000> robin_sz: would something like this help?  http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists
[17:35:57] <robin_sz> AliG1000, unlikely, thats a drag and droppy thing
[17:36:01] <aple> robin_sz: Ok, so if I just have a var or two on the page I'm querying to (in this case var_holder.php), then it will grab both those vars and store them in a JSON object?
[17:37:22] <robin_sz> aple, try :  echo "{name: "fred", age: 53}\n";
[17:37:50] <robin_sz> aple, it cant "grab" them .. you have to return a JSON formatted object
[17:38:17] <aple> Why echo name/age?
[17:38:39] <robin_sz> do you want to send someting back to the ajax call yes/no?
[17:38:56] <aple> Yeah, but it looks like you just typed static data into that echo
[17:39:02] <robin_sz> yes, I did
[17:39:28] <robin_sz> it cannot "grab" the vars, they are hidden from his its view
[17:39:39] <hamcore> Why is $("#tweets span a").timeago(new Date($("#tweets span a").val))) wrong?
[17:39:40] <robin_sz> your script has to output a json object
[17:40:48] <hamcore> robin_sz, Why is $("#tweets span a").timeago(new Date($("#tweets span a").val))) wrong?
[17:40:49] <robin_sz> eg:
[17:41:16] <AliG1000> hamcore, there is an extra closing parenthesis at the end
[17:41:48] <hamcore> $("span a").each(function(i, e){ $.timeago(new Date(this)) })
[17:42:03] <robin_sz> aple, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484156/  or read http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[17:42:43] <robin_sz> aple, the key point is the ajax cannot magically access your vars, you have to expose them via a json_encode and echo
[17:43:19] <AliG1000> hamcore, jslint.com is good for showing up suntax errors - just paste it in
[17:44:02] <robin_sz> ok, lets try this another way ... how can I add a new <li> item to a <ul> block? append? or ???
[17:44:25] <hamcore> $("#tweets span a").each(function(i, e){ /* code goes here */ })
[17:44:30] <hamcore> how to print #tweets span a value?
[17:44:40] <hamcore> by value i mean text inside <a>here</a>
[17:46:01] <AliG1000> robin_sz, try http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1145208/jquery-how-to-add-li-in-an-existing-ul

[17:46:17] <robin_sz> :)
[17:47:10] <robin_sz> ahhhh (  blah  :last).append() .. righty
[17:47:40] <robin_sz> now all I has to do is grab the first one as html,  empty() it and append the bit I grabbed
[17:48:46] <bapi_> How can I hide/show an element easily with jquery?
[17:50:47] <aple> robin_sz: Aha! I'd never heard about JSON encoding and such. Making a lot more sense now. Thanks!
[17:51:32] <hamcore> $("#tweets span a").each(function(i, e){ /* code goes here */ }) - How to print each <a> value?
[17:53:20] <aple> robin_sz: Last question. How do you call that JSON object from within index.php? For instance, can I call it with classes and such like <? echo $obj->name; ?> ?
[17:53:21] * Kamakazi grumbles profanity about browser video support
[17:53:38] <robin_sz> wtf?
[17:53:39] <robin_sz> no
[17:53:42] <robin_sz> no no no
[17:53:55] <robin_sz> index.php is your page of stuff right?
[17:54:16] <robin_sz> which gets displayed on your browser right?
[17:55:05] <aple> Yeah
[17:55:19] <robin_sz> aple: and in your page you have some Jquery ajax calls
[17:55:48] <robin_sz> and those calls go to ajax.php (or whatever) and that "page" outputs the json object
[17:55:54] <aple> Ah, it's the same http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484153/
[17:56:02] <aple> Yes
[17:56:14] <aple> var_holder.php outputs the JSON back to index.php
[17:56:26] <aple> And it comes through as a JSON object
[17:56:30] <aple> So I'm doing good there
[17:56:40] <aple> But now, how do I extract those values to use on index.php?
[17:57:33] <Lirodon> I got some jquery fadein code but its not working
[17:58:21] <robin_sz> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484160/
[17:58:40] <t4nk545> robin_sz, maybe you can take a quicl look at mine:  http://jsfiddle.net/J9z9D/6/   I move the slider, and the values pop up in an alert - but how do I use them to send the values to another page so that I can update a database?
[17:59:00] <aple> robin_sz: Ah, so data.foo
[17:59:10] <aple> Because "data" is the JSON object?
[17:59:16] <robin_sz> aple, yes, standard object access in javascript
[17:59:28] <robin_sz> no, data is a standard javascript object
[17:59:31] <aple> Awesome. Now I know everything there is to know about the internet!
[17:59:47] <robin_sz> it happened to travel over the net as a json encoded thing thats all
[17:59:50] <aple> "standard js object?
[18:00:05] <robin_sz> object
[18:00:06] <aple> k, well, I'll probably always be JSON encoding
[18:00:26] <aple> This is cool. I'm going to go play with this
[18:00:27] <aple> :)
[18:01:03] <robin_sz> t4nk545, so, instead of calling alert, just make an ajax call
[18:01:43] <robin_sz> and have a page called myAjax.php or whatever that recieves the call, grabs the data out of $_REQUEST or whatever and throws it at the db
[18:03:46] <t4nk545> I've been scratching my head on this for a while.  I can do the myAjax.php file no problem - I'm just not sure about how to send the values to that page.  i.e. what code goes where
[18:03:58] <aple> robin_sz: Crap, didn't work. http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484163/
[18:04:15] <aple> Where var_holder.php is http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484156/
[18:04:45] <aple> The JSON obj is coming through, but not changing the html or something... it's not changing the #name, #age divs
[18:05:44] <robin_sz> t4nk545, http://jsfiddle.net/J9z9D/7/
[18:05:48] <sparuvu> I have two scroll bars one is for a div (div1) and other is for child div (div2)… now is it possible to bind the scroll event to child scroll bar (div2 - scrollbar) alone ?
[18:06:19] <robin_sz> aple: oh that html(blah) might be it,
[18:06:58] <aple> html(blah) eh?
[18:07:38] <t4nk545> robin_sz, cool - checking it now      in a while I will work out how to alter my nickname back to AliG1000 :)
[18:08:07] <robin_sz> t4nk545, im not sure what value actually is though, you might need value.something
[18:08:45] <sparuvu> nvm I found it …it works
[18:10:40] <aple> robin_sz: Can't figure out what html(blah) is :)
[18:10:46] <dcarper> is there a #nextAll that will traverse back up the tree if necessary?
[18:11:49] <aple> dcarper: What are you trying to do exactly?
[18:12:04] <robin_sz> t4nk545, oh value is an array of two numbers, yuo might want {lower: value[0], upper: value[1]} or some such
[18:13:01] <dcarper> aple: i have 4 input fields for a serial number. when you fill in x characters it tabs to the next field. the input elements WERE next to each other so I could use #next or #nextAll
[18:13:02] <t4nk545> robin_sz, working on it now :)
[18:13:22] <dcarper> aple: for other reasons, the inputs are now wrapped in spans
[18:14:00] <dcarper> aple: so instead of tying my JS to the markup structure itself, a #next that would traverse up and then down the tree again to find the next input element would make me very happy :D
[18:14:37] <ajpiano> dcarper: if you want to do "any-where-in-the-dom-based-index" what you want to do is keep a collection of references
[18:14:46] <ajpiano> for instance
[18:14:52] <aple> dcarper: Have you tried closest?
[18:14:56] <aple> To traverse up the tree
[18:15:53] <ajpiano> var inputs = $("input");     and then later, assuming 'this' is an input... inputs.eq( inputs.index(this) + 1 ); would give you the next one in the dom
[18:16:56] <strike> One question that I am struggling with: doesn't all the CLASS or ID has to have different names before I can identify which DIV I have clicked? if I have 10 times: "<DIV CLASS='ANIMALS'>*diff value here for every animal*</DIV>", and I click one of those DIVs - how can the jquery know which of them I clicked?
[18:17:33] <ajpiano> strike: $("div.animals").click(function(e) { $(this) //or $(e.target);   });
[18:17:45] <dcarper> aple: doesn't work either
[18:18:12] <dcarper> ajpiano: interesting idea - that might be what I end up doing but it feels like overkill for this tiny piece of functionality
[18:18:21] <ajpiano> dcarper: you know what else is overkill?
[18:18:34] <ajpiano> hoping for "magicallyFindTheNextElementINeed()"
[18:18:46] <dcarper> ajpiano: true that!
[18:19:10] <K1ng`> wow jquery got a new function :D
[18:19:52] <dcarper> hmm the tab event itself can't be triggered?
[18:20:09] <Genesis730> coldhead:
[18:20:12] <ajpiano> nope
[18:20:30] <aple> Can anyone help me figure out how to display these vars I fetched via AJAX? index.php - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484163/ var_holder.php - http://paste.pocoo.org/show/484156/
[18:21:00] <aple> I'm grabbing vars from var_holder.php, JSON'ing them, ???, PROFIT!
[18:21:02] <gf3> not possible
[18:21:04] <gf3> sorry
[18:21:12] <gf3> try dojo
[18:22:22] <ajpiano> aple: add dataType: "json" to your ajax
[18:24:39] <aple> ajpiano: As always, thanks
[18:25:03] <aple> ajpiano: What are you anyway? Official #jquery helper? You get paid?
[18:25:18] <ajpiano> i'm the developer relations lead of the jquery project
[18:25:45] <coldhead> aple: you will receive a bill by email
[18:25:47] <ajpiano> to answer your specifc quesiton i'm a male human being, bout 5'4" etc
[18:25:52] <coldhead> your prompt payment is appreciated
[18:26:06] <robin_sz> human?
[18:26:09] <robin_sz> sigh ...
[18:26:14] <ajpiano> lawl
[18:26:20] <robin_sz> where are all the hot sexy robots when you want one?
[18:27:21] <coldhead> in google images search, under roborotica
[18:27:25] <coldhead> and renderotica
[18:29:05] <yogurt_truck> you people are sick
[18:30:13] <gf3> says the gelatinous white semi-liquid
[18:30:45] <yogurt_truck> at least i'm not ice cream
[18:30:54] <gf3> you don't know that
[18:31:07] <robin_sz> yogurt_truck, in my spare time, I feed puppies into blenders, tail first, and post videos of the expression on their faces :)
[18:31:35] <aple> ajpiano: Dev relations lead? What does that encompass?
[18:31:37] <gf3> and by blenders he means those giant margarita glasses
[18:31:50] <solidus-river> hey guys, how come this returns a function not the text in the corresponding div?
[18:32:05] <solidus-river> var div_text = $('.last_message_id).text
[18:32:11] <solidus-river> sorry
[18:32:18] <solidus-river> var div_text = $('.last_message_id').text
[18:32:38] <ajpiano> aple: doing support stuff like this, knowing what's going on in various aspects of the project, knowing who to direct people to if they have questions, etc.
[18:32:43] <ajpiano> aple: essentially the "people" part
[18:32:49] <yogurt_truck> solidus-river: text()
[18:36:33] <aple> ajpiano: Aha! So you're not just a good person!
[18:36:43] <ajpiano> well, i am
[18:36:49] <aple> Yah right
[18:36:55] <ajpiano> i don't get paid for it
[18:37:00] <ajpiano> if thats what you mean
[18:37:15] <solidus-river> yogurt_truck: thanks!
[18:37:33] <solidus-river> is there a slicker way of doing string concatination then 'stringone'+var+'stringtwo'
[18:37:55] <ajpiano> put on sunglasses first
[18:38:19] <solidus-river> ajpiano: :P
[18:38:35] <aple> You don't get paid for being a dev rel lead?
[18:38:35] <solidus-river> when i do that my string gets a bunch of %20's inbetween the concat markers and i have no clue why
[18:38:55] <yogurt_truck> aple: it's irrelevant anyway. he could be an FBI agent from the future, who gets paid by the Machine City, and it still wouldn't change the fact that you got helped
[18:39:10] <ajpiano> aple: jQuery doesn't generally pay volunteers
[18:39:22] <aple> yogurt_truck: I know. I'm just curious who he is and such
[18:39:30] <aple> ajpiano: Well, thanks for being great
[18:39:31] <ajpiano> there are a number of instances where the project signs a contractual agreement for like, large chunks of development work
[18:39:38] <aple> Same to you robin_sz
[18:39:38] <ajpiano> but that's the exception
[18:39:40] <ajpiano> :)
[18:39:53] <aple> Alright, off to play with newfound jQuery AJAX sexiness
[18:39:56] <aple> Later guys
[18:47:29] <gf3> ajpiano: for what kind of stuff?
[18:48:38] <ajpiano> gf3: mobile, grid,
[18:48:54] <ajpiano> ui too
[18:48:58] <gf3> what kinds of contracts
[18:49:10] <ajpiano> stuff where it's like 60 hours of dev a month or whatnot
[18:49:28] <gf3> cool, who is he contract with?
[18:50:30] <JohnnyDavidson> Say there was class b, which was a property of class a, and it had function c, where it needed to access a property of its parent class
[18:50:32] <ajpiano> who is he
[18:50:32] <ajpiano> :p
[18:50:34] <JohnnyDavidson> How would I get that?
[18:51:06] <JohnnyDavidson> So like, a.b.c();, and c needs to access a variable from a
[18:51:19] <gf3> JohnnyDavidson: depends how you have structured your "classes"
[18:51:30] <JohnnyDavidson> they are all like functions
[18:51:41] <gf3> it still depends
[18:51:57] <ajpiano> if you structure them using some sort of artifice that lets you have access up the prototype chain like that, then you can do that
[18:52:07] <ajpiano> in native JS there's no "super" or anything like that, however
[18:52:18] <JohnnyDavidson> So I can't just be like
[18:52:25] <JohnnyDavidson> parent.x
[18:52:31] <ajpiano> correct
[18:52:40] <JohnnyDavidson> How do I do that then?
[18:52:44] <JohnnyDavidson> Impossible?
[18:52:45] <gf3> most of the time you don't need to
[18:52:50] <ajpiano> you'll see a lot of ParentThing.prototype.method.call( this );
[18:52:51] <gf3> because JSis prototypical
[18:53:05] <gf3> and you're making it play like a class
[18:53:09] <ajpiano> but that's not the exact same thing as actually invoking the parent's method of the thing that you know *is* the parent
[18:53:16] <JohnnyDavidson> Well c is a prototype
[18:53:36] <gf3> C is not prototypal
[18:53:41] <JohnnyDavidson> ?
[18:53:54] <JohnnyDavidson> It is defined like b.prototype.c = function(){}
[18:53:59] <FNTom> ajpiano: If I want to contribute to the jQuery project, what's the best way to go about doing so?
[18:54:13] <FNTom> Don't say donate money :D
[18:54:33] <gf3> FNTom: lot's of options
[18:54:45] <JohnnyDavidson> Just being in this IRC channel is one
[18:54:45] <ajpiano> hehe, i'm doing a talk on this sunday at jqcon :)
[18:54:46] <gf3> FNTom: docs, bugs, forums, issues, etc...
[18:55:00] <ajpiano> FNTom: what gf3 said is definitely a great way to get started
[18:55:18] <FNTom> Fixing bugs?
[18:55:26] <ajpiano> doing support and forums stuff helps you get your skills on identifiying user error from jquery bugs, separating wheat from chaff, etc.
[18:56:00] <ajpiano> traiging - and of course  fixing - bugs is very valuable as well
[18:56:07] <ajpiano> most people ramp up to fixing bugs gradually
[18:56:28] <gf3> JohnnyDavidson: that being said, it's common practice to declare both a constructor property and a superproto property on a "class" in JS
[18:56:28] <ajpiano> because most bugs in jquery are intricate enough that you have to have a working knowledge of the library's internals
[18:56:37] <FNTom> I'll admit that my interest lays more in jQuery UI than jQuery :D
[18:56:51] <gf3> JohnnyDavidson: which could allow you to traverse the "inheritance" chain
[18:56:53] <ajpiano> FNTom: the same applies!!!!!
[18:57:20] <FNTom> Maybe I'll give it a shot :D
[18:57:25] <ajpiano> FNTom: support and bug triage help you to identify mistakes people are making, and be helpful to those people
[18:57:41] <ajpiano> and then that forces you to then dig into various sections of the core library code
[18:58:10] <ajpiano> FNTom: it's definitely a good move to subscribe to the bugs.jquery.com and bugs.jqueryui.com trac via e-mail or rss, etc.
[18:58:20] <ajpiano> so you'll see what's happening on a daily basis
[18:58:37] <FNTom> Still keep meaning to release my OSS Gantt UI widget, but I'm too picky about things not being 100% :(
[18:58:45] <FNTom> ^ First step to "giving back"
[18:59:12] <gf3> FNTom: preview?
[18:59:31] <FNTom> Sure, as long as you know it's not finished
[18:59:48] <FNTom> I have to recalculate the time values for zoomin / out, my original ones were kinda off :(
[18:59:50] <gf3> deal
[19:01:11] <ajpiano> FNTom: writing docs and articles always useful too, etc
[19:01:40] <FNTom> I somewhat thought Github had a basic page hosting feature?
[19:01:51] <ajpiano> it does
[19:01:53] <ajpiano> ?g github-pages
[19:01:55] <bot-t> ajpiano, GitHub Pages - Home - http://pages.github.com/
[19:03:31] <FNTom> Bleah too much hassle atm
[19:03:43] <FNTom> I'll dig out FTP details 2 secs
[19:03:56] <ajpiano> or just make a fiddle :)
[19:04:21] <FNTom> It's about 1k lines of JS and lots of CSS (gradients)
[19:04:25] <FNTom> Not sure it would be good :P
[19:04:34] * gf3 fires up the ol' GPU
[19:04:45] <K1ng`> lol
[19:04:59] <ajpiano> FNTom: you can link in remote resources to a fiddle
[19:05:08] <ajpiano> you don't have to inline it all
[19:05:17] <FNTom> But I have to host those files somewhere! :P
[19:05:27] <ajpiano> well the *files* are on github?
[19:05:31] <ajpiano> (was my assumption)
[19:05:44] <FNTom> No not yet
[19:05:48] <FNTom> As I said, it's not finished :P
[19:05:51] <ajpiano> ah
[19:05:55] <ajpiano> are they in git?
[19:06:00] <FNTom> Nope :o
[19:06:02] <ajpiano> ah
[19:06:10] <ajpiano> are they in... version control?
[19:06:14] <FNTom> nope!
[19:06:15] <gf3> zip file, bro
[19:06:19] <gf3> sme diff
[19:06:36] <FNTom> They'll be in git when I feel happy to commit them to github :P
[19:06:46] <ajpiano> lol
[19:06:51] <harleypig> i'm muddling my way through using jquery ... how can I use the .change function to call another function with the correct data? I know I can do $( "#selectbox" ).change( function() { $(this).blah } ), but I want to do more than a few lines of code.
[19:06:56] <FNTom> Until then versioning isn't really needed for a single person thing like this
[19:07:05] <ajpiano> git commit -am "Initial commit.  Also, the whole thing is done."
[19:07:13] <FNTom> EXACTLY!
[19:07:21] <ajpiano> FNTom: it's not really "versioning" so much as it is  "having some kind of audit trail for your own development'
[19:07:28] <FNTom> Oh no... I did the initial read me :p
[19:07:30] <ajpiano> having meaningful stopping points to go through etc
[19:07:37] <ajpiano> hehe
[19:07:44] <FNTom> ajpiano: Oh I know, I use git all the time for my day job
[19:07:47] <ajpiano> oh ok
[19:07:58] <FNTom> This was sort of an experiment that grew though
[19:07:59] * ajpiano breathes a sigh of relief
[19:08:02] <gf3> harleypig: triggering a faux event just to run some cod is generally bad practice
[19:08:10] <gf3> s/cod/code/
[19:08:10] <ajpiano> that's what dr. frankenstein said
[19:08:59] <mikesm> Does any one know if it's possible to unbind the TAB key the browsers
[19:09:09] <harleypig> gf3: I'm trying to populate another select box based on what is selected in the first select box.
[19:09:32] <gf3> harleypig: ahh, I see
[19:09:48] <mikesm> for example instead of letting the TAB key normally cycle between elements in the web browser itself, I want it to manipulate the content on the web page
[19:09:52] <mikesm> Possible?
[19:09:58] <gf3> harleypig: otherFunction.call( this, arg1, arg2, … )
[19:10:11] <ajpiano> mikesm: .keydown(function(e) {  e.preventDefault();  });
[19:10:24] <gf3> mikesm: bad practice, bro
[19:10:37] <gf3> mikesm: don't fuck with user's expectations
[19:10:45] <harleypig> gf3: $( "#selectbox" ).change( otherFunc.call( this, ... ) ) ?
[19:10:54] <gf3> ?tias @ harleypig
[19:10:55] <bot-t> harleypig, Try It And See
[19:11:18] <mikesm> yeah It's bad practice but I'm not sure what else I can do. I am hoping this isn't blocked by any browsers
[19:11:44] <mikesm> gf3: how else would you recommend making an online text editor?
[19:11:56] <mikesm> gf3: Users have to be able to indent somehow
[19:12:11] <gf3> mikesm: use one of the many excellent editors built already
[19:12:41] <FNTom> Okay, I'll PM the link to it
[19:12:45] <robin_sz> mikesm,  can you help me re-invent a wheel please?
[19:13:05] <mikesm> gf3: I would but it's not possible for this project, do those editors allow you to indent with tab?
[19:13:19] <ajpiano> yes
[19:13:24] <mikesm> robin_sz: It's a totally different wheel
[19:13:31] <FNTom> Collapsing doesn't take into account the connectors between tasks, zooming can be a little off (and needs better time / date displays), dragging a child drags sub childs but not multiple nests hmm.. plus some UI improvements to come
[19:13:34] <ajpiano> mikesm: is your project "build a rich text editor"
[19:13:44] <robin_sz> mikesm, i very much doubt it
[19:13:53] <ajpiano> cause unless it is, you don't want to tack "build a rich text editor" onto some other project
[19:13:59] <FNTom> ajpiano: Did you want to take a look? I'd appreciate your feedback :P
[19:14:00] <gf3> mikesm: http://ace.ajax.org/
[19:14:07] <ajpiano> FNTom: surely
[19:14:18] <FNTom> I think you'll like it since there's also no comments in the source code :D
[19:14:43] <ussher_> I have a normal a href link on a page that links to a PDF download.  sometimes the PDF creation script takes a while and I want to add a spinner so the user knows somethings happening. Only there is nothing returned to the page to tell the spinner to stop. any ideas?  Ive tried an iframe, a window.location, an ajax form submit, but the callbacks dont seam to get anything back.
[19:14:59] <solidus-river> is there a way to send data with a get or do i need to change it to a post?
[19:15:14] <solidus-river> i have data to send along with a get request but it doesnt seem to be getting distributed
[19:15:33] <harleypig> gf3: that seems to put the page in an endless loop
[19:15:46] <mikesm> robin_sz: it is not a text editor, I was just using that example to get my question across
[19:15:59] <gf3> harleypig: is the function calling itself?
[19:16:29] <robin_sz> mikesm, yeah, and I dont want a wheel, I was just using that as an example to get my poitn across
[19:16:37] <ajpiano> FNTom: this is pretty sweet :)
[19:17:09] <mikesm> robin_sz okay I don't know where this is going or care
[19:17:23] <robin_sz> mikesm, oddly enough, neither do I
[19:17:25] <FNTom> Thanks, long way to go though; gonna have it support resources / people, JSON AJAX loading, saving etc
[19:17:59] <robin_sz> mikesm, first you go on about wantinf a text editor that allows tab indent, now you tell us that was not it after all, make mind up
[19:18:00] <ajpiano> FNTom: having it progressively enhance some kinda tabular structure would be sweet too
[19:18:34] <FNTom> First jQuery widget, tried to follow "how it should be done" - seems to have changed several times over the past few years =/
[19:18:45] <ajpiano> yea well i was gonna say
[19:18:54] <ajpiano> as far as "first jquery plugins" go this one is pretty ballin'
[19:19:10] <FNTom> ajpiano: You mean take a table, read in the data, hide the table and take its place?
[19:19:18] <ajpiano> yea
[19:19:35] <mikesm> robin_sz: the tab indent is the feature I want, I used a text editor as an example everyone would understand. What the final product will exactly do is irrelevant
[19:20:05] <harleypig> gf3: No, I had to force the script to be reloaded by the browser.  Now it's not looping, but the alert in the called function isn't showing up.
[19:20:24] <ajpiano> mikesm: $("#someElement").keydown(function(e) { if (e.which == 9) { e.preventDefault(); alert("its a tab!!!!!!!!!!!!"): } });
[19:20:34] <FNTom> ajpiano: Definitely doable... thoughts on making that a plugin for the widget? To avoid bloat? No idea how to do that but sure it can be done.
[19:20:48] <robin_sz> mikesm, you probably want to use another key to simulate tab, as people want tab to do err. what tab does
[19:20:53] <gf3> harleypig: that's not .call's fault
[19:20:58] <gf3> check your code
[19:21:01] <ajpiano> FNTom: yeah, always wise to think in terms of extensibility
[19:21:02] <Kamakazi> ajpiano: will there be streams of the jqcon stuff online?
[19:21:09] <mikesm> ajpiano: thanks
[19:21:10] <gf3> also why are you using alert, harleypig?!
[19:21:18] <ajpiano> there's just something weird about "start with an empty box, now javascript and BOOM"
[19:21:21] <ajpiano> Kamakazi: naw, no livestream
[19:21:23] <harleypig> gf3: to see what's coming in
[19:21:27] <harleypig> it's not permanent
[19:21:36] <FNTom> ajpiano: Totally agree :P
[19:21:42] <gf3> harleypig: console.log
[19:21:51] <ajpiano> makes sense sometimes though
[19:22:09] <mikesm> robin_sz: I understand that but I'm not sure if I can sacrafice the intuitiveness of the TAB key though, It will only change the function of the TAB key when certain elements on the page are selected
[19:22:18] <FNTom> ajpiano: I did try progressive display, where as you add the task it renders it, but because the graph adjusts its size / date widths to fit the data (try resizing the bar off the edge) it caused too many redraws
[19:22:30] <mikesm> robin_sz: it's a tradeoff, but I donno. Maybe I'll find a better way that's just as intuitive
[19:23:00] <harleypig> This is what I've got: $( document ).ready( function() { changeImageSelect( this ) ); }); function changeImageSelect( s ) { alert( 'Changed to ' + s ); } ... is there anything wrong with that? other than console.log?
[19:23:07] <robin_sz> mikesm, sounds worse
[19:23:38] <mikesm> robin_sz, what sounds worse?
[19:23:58] <mikesm> robin_sz: remvoing tab functionality?
[19:24:12] <harleypig> now, when the page loads it just does the spinny thing and sits there.
[19:24:16] <harleypig> argh ... this is frustrating
[19:24:22] <mikesm> It's not the worst thing in my opinion, maybe it would suck for people trying to browse the site with TAB
[19:24:33] <exitdescription> f
[19:25:20] <robin_sz> mikesm, having a tab key that changed its function based on some hidden logic the user is not expecting, depending on some conditions the suer cannot pre-know
[19:25:35] <robin_sz> true, it is not the worst thing
[19:25:41] <mikesm> robin_sz: in http://ace.ajax.org/build/kitchen-sink.html they do the same thing with the TAB key. Within the text area it exhibits different behaviour
[19:25:54] <robin_sz> theres that animated "under construction" gif which is worse for a start
[19:25:56] <ajpiano> robin_sz: it's a bit absolutist to say that "there is never a usecase for overriding tab"
[19:26:19] <robin_sz> ajpiano, true, but it would need to be highly obvious
[19:26:38] <ajpiano> yeah, usually it's like "well, right now, tab does nothing, and the user would expect it to 'go to the next field'"
[19:26:44] <ajpiano> like in an inline-editable situation
[19:27:09] <robin_sz> tab when focus is on an editable textarea is not so bad
[19:27:13] * robin_sz nods
[19:27:46] <robin_sz> OKm that works for me
[19:27:51] <robin_sz> I take it back ;)
[19:28:55] <gf3> eh
[19:29:03] <gf3> if there's one thing I have learned
[19:29:18] <gf3> is you don't fuck with web users' expectations
[19:30:15] <ajpiano> i thought you were gonna say
[19:30:18] <ajpiano> "when on bike, avoid car"
[19:30:31] <gf3> ajpiano: clearly I have learned nothing in that department
[19:31:09] <ajpiano> setTimeout( function() { gf3.numOfCarsHitBy++; }, 127278908901284390124);
[19:31:26] <coldhead> what about "beware of whores who say they don't want money"
[19:32:02] <gf3> I don't want any money...
[19:32:23] * ajpiano besware
[19:32:46] <FNTom> When on bike, avoid car - unless there's a good potentially to get a massive payout from it.
[19:32:59] <FNTom> a good potential* Sheesh
[19:33:03] <FNTom> Need more sleep these days
[19:33:10] <coldhead> is a massive payout worth more than your life? often yes
[19:33:32] <FNTom> Take some precautions, like don't look directly at the sun while car diving.
[19:34:29] <coldhead> car diving has a lot of other precautions
[19:34:39] <coldhead> like taking enough oxygen
[19:35:02] <gf3> I'm on hour ~40 of no sleep
[19:35:36] <FNTom> Oh that's why you make no sense!
[19:35:38] <FNTom> Kidding ;)
[19:35:52] <Genesis730> coldhead: were you helping me with my jquery animation not too long ago?
[19:36:00] <gf3> oddly enough, I've been extremely productive
[19:36:11] <gf3> Genesis730: unlikely
[19:36:17] <gf3> Genesis730: today is his first day
[19:36:48] <ajpiano> not too long ago coldhead was wishing a tearful goodbye to the lupine being he knew as his mother
[19:37:04] <ajpiano> it's all relative
[19:37:35] <coldhead> that doesn't sound like something i'd do, Genesis730
[19:37:39] <coldhead> i'm a terrible person
[19:37:53] <coldhead> maybe you are thinking of cloudhead?
[19:37:55] <Genesis730> nevermind :P i'm tryin to find someone that was helping me with this jquery update with animation a week or two ago
[19:38:06] <FNTom> cloudhead doesn't sound very attentive.
[19:38:11] <Genesis730> lol
[19:38:52] <coldhead> it's not something someone else could help with?
[19:39:36] <Genesis730> well he said he had a better way of approaching or coding the script
[19:39:59] <Genesis730> thought it was cold somethin.... hmmm
[19:43:01] <Genesis730> too many people in here to remember :P
[19:43:07] <coldhead> link us to what you have anyway
[19:43:12] <coldhead> someone might have suggestions
[19:43:19] <coldhead> gf3 and ajpiano are smart cookies
[19:43:27] <coldhead> with enormous pectoral muscles
[19:43:31] <coldhead> and great hair
[19:43:33] <Genesis730> well it sorta works, effect doesn't play if it fails and IE has problems :(
[19:43:36] <gf3> aka man boobs
[19:43:40] <coldhead> and winning smiles
[19:46:36] <FNTom> Should recreate the ACID3 test in jQuery that always fails on 99% and obfusicate the JS :o
[19:47:40] <hamcore> $("#tweets span a").each(function(i, e){ /* code goes here */ }) - How to print each value inside <a></a>?
[19:48:12] <frank04> I seem to have found a bug in 1.7b1 - malfunction with jQueryUI slider mouse events. Anybody else seeing this?
[19:49:09] <ajpiano> frank04: it's good to note it, but ui hasn't been tested against 1.7 yet at all
[19:50:04] <hamcore> ajpiano, $("#tweets span a").each(function(i, e){ /* code goes here */ }) - How to print each value inside <a></a>?
[19:50:15] <hamcore> i tried this.val()
[19:50:15] <ajpiano> console.log( $(this).text() );
[19:50:21] <hamcore> hum
[19:50:25] <hamcore> thanks, ajpiano.
[19:50:34] <ajpiano> frank04: can you file a bug on http://bugs.jquery.com with a reduced testcase plz :)
[19:51:30] <WebDragon|laptop> anyone know if there's a modernizr support channel around freenode? #modernizr is registered but no one's in it
[19:51:49] <WebDragon|laptop> I woulda asked paul_irish but he ain't around either
[19:51:54] <hamcore> ajpiano, one more please, how do i convert 'Tue Sep 27 22:02:51 +0000 2011' to seconds, i want to use $.timeago plugin
[19:53:10] <gf3> hamcore: dude, you have to try first
[19:53:23] <WebDragon|laptop> is there a googlebot in here?
[19:53:30] <ajpiano> ?eval new Date('Tue Sep 27 22:02:51 +0000 2011')
[19:53:31] <gf3> ?g NO U @ WebDragon|laptop
[19:53:31] <bot-t> ajpiano: <2011-09-27T22:02:51.000Z>
[19:53:32] <bot-t> WebDragon|laptop, NO U | Know Your Meme - http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/no-u
[19:53:41] <Heshanh> why is it when i set a dfault date to a datepicker field it doesnt show it
[19:53:46] <WebDragon|laptop> .?g javascript mdc datetime parse
[19:53:52] <WebDragon|laptop> doh
[19:53:55] <WebDragon|laptop> ?g javascript mdc datetime parse
[19:53:55] <Heshanh> using value=""
[19:53:56] <bot-t> WebDragon|laptop, parse - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse
[19:54:03] <WebDragon|laptop> hamcore: ^ see above
[19:54:12] <WebDragon|laptop> just a guess, mind you
[19:54:30] <hamcore> thanks, WebDragon|laptop ajpiano gf3.
[19:54:55] <cypha> how can I get a little link to show up when I mouseover an image? for example, the way fb has it to edit the profile picture
[19:55:16] <hamcore> something's wrong here.
[19:55:20] <cypha> how is that position determined?
[19:55:21] <hamcore> $("#tweets span a").each(function(i, e){ $.timeago(Date.parse($(this).text())) })
[19:55:49] <WebDragon|laptop> anyone here know Modernizr at all ? I got this dang wordpress theme with the 1.6 version built in -- ok so I go to update to the latest, and I find that there's a ton of clickable download options to build it with -- and I have no idea what this 1.6 thing was built with or even if it HAD such a huge D/l options page
[19:56:17] <gf3> WebDragon|laptop: you could just get everything
[19:56:18] <WebDragon|laptop> don't want to get the kitchen-sink version of modernizr 2.x if I don't need to
[19:56:23] <gf3> WebDragon|laptop: the build system is new
[19:56:26] <WebDragon|laptop> that's true enough
[19:56:53] <WebDragon|laptop> be nice if the d/l page had indicators like (new since v1.7) and suchlike
[19:56:57] <Heshanh> I can see the value set on html but it doesnt show up on the page
[19:56:57] <WebDragon|laptop> if any of them ARE new
[19:57:42] <gf3> hamcore: did you even read the docs?
[19:58:07] <hamcore> gf3 for sure.
[19:58:12] <gf3> ORLY?
[19:58:37] <frank04> Reducing bug now. Thanks!
[19:58:52] <hamcore> rly.
[19:59:10] <gf3> hamcore: I don't believe you
[19:59:12] <gf3> hamcore: http://timeago.yarp.com/
[19:59:22] <hamcore> i also tried ... .timeago();
[19:59:51] <Genesis730> well this is the animation, i can't see how to get it to run the return function if the query fails (possible error) and IE has problems?? maybe an outdated or unsupported call or method or somethin??  http://jsfiddle.net/YYhr4/   when the error happens, i get mysql_result() [<a href='function.mysql-result'>function.mysql-result</a>]: Unable to jump to row 0 on MySQL result index 9 in <b>file1.php</b> on line <b>15</b><br />
[20:00:32] <jedimind_> what would be the easiest way to select every sibling preceding $(this)
[20:00:37] <hamcore> gf3 console shows there's no timeago method, but i already put timeago js in the head
[20:00:55] <gf3> hamcore: after jQuery?
[20:01:25] <hamcore> gf3 yes, inside plugin.js, i'm using html5 boilerplate.
[20:01:39] <gf3> wat
[20:02:13] <hamcore> gf3 http://html5boilerplate.com/
[20:03:47] <gf3> hamcore: yes yes
[20:04:07] <hamcore> there's a js/plugin.js where you can put all your plugins.
[20:04:12] <hamcore> i set it there.
[20:04:24] <Heshanh> guys any one knows why a datepiker field wont show a default value
[20:04:26] <hamcore> already tried to download and insert <script src="js/jquery.timeago.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[20:04:30] <hamcore> but it still doesn't work.
[20:04:39] <hamcore> Uncaught TypeError: Object 1317160971000 has no method 'timeago'
[20:04:43] <hamcore> that's what console shows.
[20:10:34] <hamcore> gf3 "300".timeago() should work?
[20:11:12] <gf3> :-/
[20:11:13] <gf3> no
[20:11:19] <cypha> how can I float a link over a picture upon hovering?
[20:11:49] <hamcore> gf3 why not?
[20:11:50] <gf3> cypha: exactly how you just said
[20:12:00] <gf3> hamcore: dude, just read that page
[20:12:10] <hamcore> gf3 k.
[20:12:11] <cypha> gf3, how do I "float the link" part?
[20:12:26] <gf3> cypha: float: left;
[20:13:12] <gf3> cypha: there are many options
[20:13:22] <gf3> cypha: relative/absolute positioning
[20:13:23] <gf3> etc...
[20:13:33] <cypha> relative to the image?
[20:13:40] <gf3> or the parent
[20:13:40] <cypha> width is 100
[20:13:41] <hamcore> gf3 there's something wrong, neither new Date().timeago() works
[20:13:54] <cypha> so I can always make it the top right corner
[20:14:01] <cypha> of the image
[20:14:08] <gf3> hamcore: SRSLY, I am going to drown you
[20:14:16] <gf3> (in hugs)
[20:14:23] <cypha> lol
[20:14:30] <hamcore> :/
[20:14:52] <gf3> hamcore: it doesn't mention a method on date instances anywhere
[20:15:31] <cypha> gf3, could you show me a way?
[20:15:42] <cypha> $(#profile_pic).hover(function(){
[20:15:51] <gf3> cypha: sec
[20:16:03] <cypha> k
[20:17:58] <coldhead> Genesis730: i can't see anything that might upset IE there, try pasting the code into jshint.com
[20:18:11] <coldhead> then work out which warnings you can safely ignore :)
[20:18:26] <Genesis730> okay
[20:19:39] <hamcore> gf3 i think the error is that new Date() returns Thu Sep 29 2011 00:18:41 GMT-0300 (Hora oficial do Brasil) with this (Hora ...
[20:20:14] <gf3> cypha: http://jsfiddle.net/8UE87/
[20:20:37] <cypha> haha
[20:21:51] <cypha> oh, no js?
[20:21:53] <coldhead> lol Hora
[20:21:54] <cypha> only css
[20:22:06] <gf3> hamcore: that's not the issue
[20:22:54] <hamcore> gf3 i have to convert Thu Sep 29 2011 00:18:41 GMT-0300 (Hora oficial do Brasil) to 2011-07-29...
[20:23:18] <snover> gf3: what IS the issue? YOU?
[20:23:35] <gf3> snover: must be
[20:23:37] <hamcore> oh my.
[20:23:47] <snover> NAILED IT
[20:24:06] <snover> hamcore: uninstall gf3 and then everything will work
[20:24:12] <gf3> snover, our resident code analyst and therapist
[20:24:20] <gf3> you know where this is going...
[20:24:24] <snover> gf3: you want to sleep with your father.
[20:24:26] <hamcore> no fight, guys.
[20:24:28] <snover> $300 please.
[20:24:38] <gf3> ohhhh you analrapist
[20:25:11] <snover> that's DOCTOR analrapist to you.
[20:25:31] <snover> connery.
[20:25:37] <snover> conneryf3
[20:25:55] <gf3> shmea
[20:31:16] <cypha> gf3, the absolute position of 'over-easy a' is relative to the div it's in?
[20:32:12] <gf3> cypha: the position absolute is relative to the parent position relative
[20:32:24] <gf3> awkward wording
[20:32:28] <cypha> yeah
[20:32:30] <cypha> :)
[20:32:44] <cypha> i'm trying to avoid any absolute positioning
[20:32:50] <Brodingo> twss
[20:32:53] <gf3> cypha: basically "yes"
[20:32:59] <cypha> k
[20:33:08] <cypha> then that's fine
[20:33:23] <cypha> is 'over-easy img' relative or absolute?
[20:34:13] <gf3> cypha: img is absolutely positioned in .over-easy only
[20:34:20] <cypha> kk
[20:34:39] <gf3> cypha: safe to stack and re-use
[20:35:23] <cypha> oh wait, no, if I explicitly say "position: absolute" for 'over-easy img' everything on my page shifts up and the img blocks the text
[20:36:04] <gf3> no
[20:36:29] <waigani> i'm using the jquery ui autocomplete. I need to display one value in the suggestion and enter another in the input field. For example: suggestion = 'username - joe blow' input = 'username'
[20:37:15] <Heshanh> does they jquer cycle plugin if i use noConflict?
[20:37:21] <cypha> that's what happened :)
[20:38:42] <waigani> this is the autocomplete that I am using: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#option-source
[20:50:32] <transfire> How does one handle an or-condition in a tmpl {{if}}?
[20:51:13] <transfire> e.g. {{if x.length || y.length}}
[20:52:39] <coldhead> i try to move that kind of thing to the JS level
[20:53:09] <coldhead> and then just have {{ if show_those_lengths_or_whatever }}
[20:53:16] <snover> that’s because you don’t know how to use templates coldhead
[20:53:18] <coldhead> because tmpl is a bitch
[20:53:37] <transfire> lol
[20:53:42] <coldhead> i have been able to break tmpl by using an '@' in my html
[20:54:02] <coldhead> annnyway snover will help you out, transfire
[20:54:03] <snover> shocking.
[20:54:08] <coldhead> it's my first day using tmpl
[20:54:09] <snover> no nice try coldhead.
[20:54:25] <coldhead> maybe try parens?
[20:54:46] <coldhead> try parens and then try PMing snover
[20:54:50] <coldhead> SO TIRED
[20:56:00] <transfire> think parems worked
[20:56:10] <transfire> had to use $item too
[20:56:41] <coldhead> tmpl is hard
[20:59:51] <huntedmitch> lol
[21:05:10] <strike> what's wrong with me :d I've checked 10 times that this code is exactly like in my project (which works), but this does not http://jsfiddle.net/RvyDX/1/
[21:05:28] <strike> click div --> echo text in the input field. not working :<<
[21:07:01] <huntedmitch> strike: you want to alert the input boxes value?
[21:07:23] <strike> I want to show the div values inside input box.
[21:07:29] <strike> 32 64 140 ---> to the input box :)
[21:07:49] <strike> but somehow Nothinggg happens when clicking that div =D I SHould SLEEP
[21:10:45] <branchain> hello. i'm developing a plugin that sets up a three.js world called via $.plugin (without a selector) as well as manipulates dom elements. right now i'm storing three.js data in $(document.body).data(). is there a better pattern for a plugin like this?
[21:12:47] <huntedmitch> strike: I tidied your HTML's and fixed it. Next time be sure to include the library. ;-) http://jsfiddle.net/RvyDX/4/
[21:14:56] <transfire> any way to set a variable in a tmpl ?
[21:15:12] <devinrolsen> {{$somevar}}
[21:15:17] <huntedmitch> transfire: You'd be smart to listen to coldhead, I'd do all the lifting in js
[21:16:02] <strike> ! thanks huntedmitch .. ~first time I use jsfiddle, I had no idea the library had to be choosen separately. thanks. Well actually now I'll get to the initial problem I had in my mind: Is there a way to get those three values separately from inside the div ? I mean like: http://jsfiddle.net/RvyDX/3/
[21:16:11] <strike> first input 32, second 64 and third 140.
[21:16:23] <devinrolsen> transfire - http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/ good stuff.
[21:17:27] <devinrolsen> also I stand corrected, vars are ${Name} and {{if}}{{/if}} are conditions.
[21:17:50] <transfire> like i haven't spent all day there
[21:18:40] <huntedmitch> strike: Here you go dude http://jsfiddle.net/RvyDX/5/
[21:18:44] <devinrolsen> k, well do you have some code you could throw into jsfiddle?
[21:18:50] <devinrolsen> I would be willing to take a look at it.
[21:20:00] <strike> huntedmitch <3 I am in gratiDude ;) big thanks. Now I'll just redo it myself 10 times to learn 8)
[21:20:28] <huntedmitch> strike: np dude, the best way to learn is to see stuff done
[21:20:29] <transfire> @huntedmitch as far as can image it having to do that would be big mess
[21:20:36] <strike> and btw. do you prefer to use $(this) instead of $(e.target) ?
[21:21:01] <transfire> I'm iterating over lists of references which I have to lookup in a table
[21:21:47] <transfire> e.g.
[21:21:47] <transfire>         {{if modules}}
[21:21:47] <transfire>           {{each(i,x) modules}}
[21:21:47] <transfire>             ${ var doc = Rebecca.documentation_by_key[x], '' }
[21:21:47] <transfire>             <li class="${doc['!']}"><a href="${doc.id}">${doc.name}</a></li>
[21:21:48] <transfire>           {{/each}}
[21:21:48] <transfire>         {{/if}}
[21:24:07] <huntedmitch> Can anyone see what is wrong with this regex? I am trying to replace anything that isn't a letter or a number with a space… ----    .replace('[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]+',' ')
[21:28:58] <Corey> huntedmitch: Lose the space before the closing square bracket.
[21:30:28] <huntedmitch> No dice.
[21:30:32] <huntedmitch> Tried this too ---- .replace('[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]+',' '));
[21:38:51] <transfire> .replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]+/,' ') ?
[21:42:12] <huntedmitch> There is a syntax error in that
[21:43:19] * huntedmitch shakes fist at Colloquy
[21:43:30] <solidus-river> hey guys, i have an ajax request thats succeeding, however the success method does not get called of the ajax function
[21:43:41] <solidus-river> the response is 200
[21:43:48] <solidus-river> and it gives me data in my debug tools
[21:44:00] <solidus-river> but the success: function(data) { blah } never gets run
[21:44:52] <kerozene> anyone here used livequery in a chrome ext?
[21:45:31] <kerozene> it triggers on dom updates from within a content script but not from a page script. what's that about?
[21:46:05] <kerozene> (#chromium-extensions is dead)
[21:51:02] <solidus-river> oh, if i have dataType to a response as bieng a script, will it run any jquery commands i give it in the context of the current dom element?
[21:54:26] <solidus-river> i'm getting a parser error on this: $("\n").insertBefore('.next_message_marker')
[21:59:30] <solidus-river> hmm
[22:00:39] <solidus-river> how do i get more information out of a parseerror, then just a parseerror message
[22:00:43] <solidus-river> i want to know why its a parse error
[22:01:38] <transfire> w00t, got it. thanks all.
[22:12:47] <solidus-river> hmm
[22:12:52] <solidus-river> i appear to be at a stand still
[22:12:57] <solidus-river> insert before is just not woking at all
[22:13:22] <solidus-river> is it a new method or something?
[22:14:01] <coldhead> hell no
[22:14:06] <coldhead> you're probably doing it wrong
[22:14:17] <solidus-river> coldhead: $('hey man i ran').insertBefore('.next_message_marker');
[22:14:17] <coldhead> are you sure you have the arguments in the right order?
[22:14:30] <coldhead> ah that won't work
[22:14:35] <coldhead> jQuery operates on html nodes
[22:14:40] <coldhead> and that is just plain text
[22:14:46] <coldhead> you need to wrap it in a span or something
[22:14:53] <coldhead> capiche?
[22:15:06] <solidus-river> coldhead: ah! thats pretty good to know!
[22:15:12] <coldhead> yes :)
[22:15:19] <coldhead> important face
[22:15:21] <coldhead> fact*
[22:15:35] <solidus-river> thats probably why i'm getting a parse error in my script from my ajax call back as well
[22:15:51] <solidus-river> its $('\n').insertBefore('.next_message_marker');
[22:16:03] <solidus-river> kk, reworking, thanks :)
[22:16:49] <coldhead> good luck!
[22:18:57] <amh345> evening.  im trying to add 5 to a value if a dropdown is set to 'true/yes'.  i have the code functioning partially- but it keeps adding the value of and over again everytime i release on 'yes/true'. is there a way to only have it add 5 the one time?   here is the code. http://jsfiddle.net/5Gamh/
[22:27:27] <tcmarsh> since the total is already global, you could use it - just check if it's greater than zero on a yes click, then don't increase it.
[22:29:21] <coldhead> ?unbind
[22:29:21] <bot-t> .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[22:29:33] <coldhead> if you unbind inside the handler you can stop it ever running again
[22:29:40] <coldhead> EVER

[22:30:56] <modn> I have an issue with jquery validation thats doing my head in... i have conditional required rules, and im wanting to append a * to the required fields..
[22:31:11] <modn> i have been looking for a long time for a solution and have come up with no real solution..
[22:31:14] <modn> can any one help
[22:33:03] <modn> anybody?
[22:51:36] <amh345> unbind wont work because i need to be able to subtrack 5 on the occasion someone clicks "no".  and globally checking if it's greater than zero also wont work because there are other dropdowns im going to have adding to that total.    ugh. maybe i should just use a checkbox.
[22:51:55] <Heshanh> can u use the cycle plugin with noConflict
[22:52:32] <coldhead> if the cycle plugin is properly designed then yes
[22:54:56] <chovy> what is this forEach?
[22:54:57] <chovy> menuData.items.forEach
[22:56:45] <coldhead> ?mdc foreach @ chovy
[22:56:47] <bot-t1> chovy, forEach - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Executes a provided function once per array element. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[22:56:53] <coldhead> it's not a jQuery thing
[22:59:21] <FNTom> Not strictly jQuery, but why do some browsers choke and die with console.log?
[22:59:21] <Heshanh> the cycle plugin uses $ wouldnt that confliect if theres another lib
[23:00:18] <coldhead> FNTom: if the browser doesn't provide a console object you can't call any methods on it
[23:00:36] <coldhead> ?eval nosuchobject.log('this won\'t work')
[23:00:37] <bot-t1> coldhead: ReferenceError: nosuchobject is not defined
[23:00:58] <coldhead> Heshanh: you can wrap the plugin in a safe environment where $ means what it needs to mean
[23:01:11] <Heshanh> how....
[23:01:15] <coldhead> Heshanh: http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries
[23:01:24] <coldhead> read that and use the power of mental thought
[23:01:36] <FNTom> coldhead: I would of expected a graceful ignore of the function though. But IE for instance, it just treats it as another undefined function and stops processing the JS =/
[23:01:49] <coldhead> most especially this near the end, Heshanh (function($) { /* some code that uses $ */ })(jQuery)
[23:01:58] <coldhead> FNTom: would have* expected
[23:02:16] <coldhead> FNTom: it IS any other undefined function
[23:02:31] <FNTom> coldhead: Yes yes, 8am now but still my bad ;)
[23:02:35] <coldhead> IE should just provide a console object, instead of handlign this magic object especially
[23:02:36] <Heshanh> hmm ok well that should work then
[23:02:52] <coldhead> Heshanh: millions of plugins are using that right now!
[23:02:56] <coldhead> AS I WRITE
[23:07:12] <coldhead> FNTom: you can get the behaviour you want with something like this: if (typeof console === 'undefined') console = {};
[23:07:40] <coldhead> oh wait, i guess you need a dummy fn there as well
[23:07:46] <coldhead> STILL, it's in your hands
[23:08:12] <FNTom> Hah, it just sucks having to comment out any console.logs while deving just to test it on IE
[23:08:34] <FNTom> I guess.. might be possible to create a global object for console.log that does nothing?
[23:08:37] <FNTom> Conditional to IE
[23:08:52] <chovy> coldhead: is that supported by IE, i mean is forEach a jquery thing or something mozilla put into firefox.
[23:09:18] <coldhead> it's not supported except in modern browsers, chovy
[23:09:59] <coldhead> FNTom: if you dob't want to reinvent the wheel: http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-debug-console-log/
[23:10:29] <coldhead> FNTom: don't make it conditional to IE, base it on whether or not console is already defined
[23:10:33] <FNTom> Ahh ty :)
[23:11:38] <modn> I have an issue with jquery validation thats doing my head in... i have conditional required rules, and im wanting to append a * to the required fields..
[23:11:41] <modn> i have been looking for a long time for a solution and have come up with no real solution..
[23:11:44] <modn> can any one help
[23:16:18] <Chibby_> could anyone please tell me if there's some way to set the value of an input element that would also trigger the .change() event on that element?
[23:17:40] <Cork[home]> Chibby_: why don't you just trigger the change event your self?
[23:17:57] <Cork[home]> $input.trigger('change')
[23:18:11] <lilrkt> Can someone tell me why my form won't submit? http://dun7003.lilrkt.ca/
[23:18:22] <jacof> hi . could anyone give me some hints on how to turn the selected options of a multiple select into sel=opt1+op2+op3 instead of sel=opt1&sel=opt2&sel=opt3 in the GET parameters?
[23:20:00] <jacof> like .i need to tap into the submit action
[23:20:19] <jacof> and change the value of the select, and then submit the form i guess.
[23:21:42] <Chibby_> oh, didn't realise you could do that without.. nm... thanks (:
[23:24:43] <Cork[home]> Chibby_: you could add a hidden field and grab the .val() from the select area
[23:25:03] <Cork[home]> if you don't give the select a name it shouldn't submit its value
[23:25:12] <Cork[home]> and you should be able to construct your own
[23:26:55] <koszi> hello, does anyone knows gmail like labels select plugin?
[23:36:28] <fructose> How would you test if the UI lib is being correctly sourced?
[23:37:00] <fructose> My functions are failing, but I'm not sure if it could be a version mismatch or something, as I'm not getting any 404 errors
