[00:03:39] <P0RK> How difficult would it be to click a buttyon, then drag a rectangle over a page and have that rectangle enlarge to take up the screen. I assume HTML5 canvas would have to be involved...anybody know"
[00:06:05] <Cork> P0RK: you could do it with dom too
[00:06:19] <P0RK> meaning?
[00:06:21] <Cork> the rectangle would just have to be an absolute positioned element
[00:06:38] <Cork> P0RK: meaning too little info to tell what you need
[00:07:02] <P0RK> There's a really simple piece of software called trialpad that allows an attorney to drag a marquis on a page and it expands to fit width
[00:07:18] <akshayvishnoi> hey, i am using jquery UI sortable, can I create a situation where I can have a sortable list and I can have another sortable list for the options of parent sortable list?
[00:07:28] <P0RK> I said, I think you can do something similar with HTML5 for about 900 $ less
[00:07:53] <Cork> uh
[00:08:13] <Cork> P0RK: 900 dollars to catch mouse movements and resize a div?
[00:08:18] <Cork> thats a lot
[00:08:32] <P0RK> Maybe a div or maybe part of a div and part of a pic
[00:08:41] <Cork> your missing the point
[00:08:54] <Cork> the rectangle you want to draw is the div
[00:09:15] <Cork> and the expanding; are you talking about zoom
[00:09:23] <P0RK> Come on now, that's the easy part
[00:09:24] <Cork> or should it just animate to window size?
[00:09:39] <Cork> P0RK: you arn't making it easy to answer
[00:11:05] <akshayvishnoi> hey, i am using jquery UI sortable, can I create a situation where I can have a sortable list and I can have another sortable list for the options of parent sortable list?
[00:11:11] <akshayvishnoi> anyone!
[00:11:41] <P0RK> Cork, trying to find a video example. Gimme one sec. thanks for your help, bt
[00:11:42] <P0RK> btw
[00:12:23] <Cork> akshayvishnoi: parent sortable list?
[00:12:40] <Cork> akshayvishnoi: you can nest sortable lists inside another one if that is what you mean
[00:12:41] <P0RK> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpuvR5Mc-RI
[00:13:01] <akshayvishnoi> yes
[00:13:35] <akshayvishnoi> does jquery UI sortable provides this functionality
[00:13:39] <Cork> akshayvishnoi: just have an ul inside an <ul><li> and you will have it
[00:13:48] <Cork> yes
[00:13:59] <akshayvishnoi> i m not working with ul li structure..
[00:14:07] <Cork> P0RK: ah, you want to crop the content
[00:14:23] <akshayvishnoi> i have div/div structure…
[00:14:27] <Cork> P0RK: that becomes a little more complicated
[00:14:32] <P0RK> at about :46 seconds
[00:14:50] <Cork> P0RK: screen shooting the page isn't allowed from canvas
[00:15:03] <P0RK> dang it
[00:15:34] <Cork> P0RK: so all the content would have to be inside canvas to do it that way
[00:16:24] <Cork> css transform scale() might be able to do it though
[00:16:24] <Cork> but you would have to have two copies of the page loaded
[00:16:47] <Cork> P0RK: the best solution i can think of is to have an iframe with a copy of the page loaded
[00:17:00] <Cork> and then scroll it based on the rectangle start position
[00:17:07] <Cork> and scale it based on the other corner
[00:17:20] <Cork> and transform scale it to be the full size of the screen
[00:17:24] <Cork> it MIGHT work
[00:17:39] <P0RK> since it's all local off his pc or dropbox, i should be able to preload anything he needs...
[00:18:25] <Cork> P0RK: actually local is normally much more restricted then the other way around
[00:18:54] <P0RK> I was thinking about load times, not restrictions. I see your point
[00:20:22] <P0RK> Okay. I'm going to go ahead and advise him to get the software for all the attorneys in the office. Big expense, but that's the life of an attorney.
[00:20:44] <P0RK> Rayther than beat my head against a wall trying to make it work another way
[00:20:53] <akshayvishnoi> hey i have got a good reference - http://jsfiddle.net/3kdSZ/8/…. thanks for answering
[00:21:07] <P0RK> Thanks for your help as always.
[00:43:49] <sEEkz> Hi all
[00:45:47] <sEEkz> How do you: document.querySelector('#payment_methods').querySelectorAll('input[type=radio]') do in jQuery, and I don't mean $('#payment_methods input[type=radio]'), but if you have pm = $('#payment_methods'), how do I get the radio's? .children('input[type=radio]') does not seem to work
[00:59:41] <helvetet> anyone know of any small preload plugin?
[01:01:40] <helvetet> actually doesn't have to be small
[01:36:59] <dANO> hi
[01:37:56] <dANO> I use ajax for request a data.Id , how I can try now if this data.id is present in my page ?
[01:39:45] <Woet> dANO: you're not making any sense.
[01:40:51] <helvetet> guessing data is a element?
[01:42:15] <lilsammy> In jquery 1.11.1 is there a compatible waypoints plugin or method of doing things when scrolling past named elements?
[01:42:31] <lilsammy> the waypoints plugin I tried kept failing
[01:43:57] <helvetet> which one are you using
[01:44:00] <helvetet> lilsammy
[01:44:26] <lilsammy> http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/
[01:44:29] <dANO> I have a table with tr#PostId , I use ajax for search the last post and return this id. But I dont know How i can check if the tr#PostId  = data.id. I just try to create a system like twitter with 1 new tweet.
[01:44:40] <helvetet> you sure you included the script after jquery?
[01:45:02] <lilsammy> yeah I think its somthing to do with using it in wordpress
[01:45:08] <helvetet> oh
[01:45:23] <Woet> dANO: you are asking how to compare 2 values..?
[01:45:43] <helvetet> lilsammy: you are making your own theme right
[01:45:53] <lilsammy> yeah
[01:45:59] <helvetet> have you added other jquery plugins before?
[01:46:13] <dANO> Not compare just try to know if the value is present in my view
[01:46:15] <lilsammy> only chart.js which didn't seem to be a problem
[01:46:29] <helvetet> jquery in wordpress is in safemode
[01:46:38] <helvetet> meaning scripts that call $() doesnt work
[01:46:44] <helvetet> you have to do jQuery()
[01:46:51] <lilsammy> Yeah I knew this but,
[01:46:58] <dANO> I think i need to create each for inspect all id in my tr.
[01:47:19] <lilsammy> If I encase the script plugin in Jquery function($) type thing will it not be compatible?
[01:48:43] <helvetet> it should
[01:48:48] <helvetet> if its in the right place
[01:48:57] <HowardwLo> if you append static resources using jQuery after the DOM has loaded, is that resource cached?
[01:49:49] <nozavroni> I need something like toggle that toggles the clicked link text
[01:49:59] <HowardwLo> i use ajax to navigate pages, and some pages require additional resrouces that I append with jQ, just wondering if that is cached or not
[01:50:01] <helvetet> but lilsammy the waypoints script does work with that version
[01:50:06] <nozavroni> when the user clicks the link, it changes to "cancel" and when they click it again, it changes back to what it was.
[01:50:13] <nozavroni> but the docs say "toggle()" is deprecated
[01:50:15] <lilsammy> That will be why its not working then lol
[01:50:26] <nozavroni> was it deprecated in favor of another method?
[01:50:40] <nozavroni> I cant find in the docs what I should use instead of toggle
[01:50:53] <lilsammy> If there any method of using waypoints in 1.11.1 anyone knows of?
[01:51:13] <helvetet> i wrote that it DOES work
[01:51:17] <helvetet> haha
[01:51:21] <lilsammy> ohoohooh
[01:51:22] <lilsammy> lol
[01:51:22] <nozavroni> pretty simple task, but I just dont want to use toggle() if its not what Im supposed to use
[01:51:29] <nozavroni> it says deprecated
[01:51:33] <lilsammy> Sorry im reading too fast
[01:51:45] <nozavroni> anybody know why its deprecated?
[01:54:21] <nozavroni> nevermind I'll just use click()
[01:56:28] <lilsammy> I use click
[01:58:10] <helvetet> lilsammy:
[01:58:23] <helvetet> did you try to wrap the script in (function($) { })( jQuery );
[01:58:32] <lilsammy> trying it now
[01:58:47] <helvetet> that only works if the plugin is loaded after jquery though
[01:59:05] <helvetet> jQuery(document).ready(function( $ ) { });
[01:59:07] <helvetet> that might also work
[02:02:06] <lilsammy> No neither work its odd, its deffinetly being loaded after jquery
[02:02:19] <lilsammy> but as soon as the script is loaded it prevents any further loading of the page
[02:02:33] <lilsammy> not got any console errors so slightly puzzling
[02:07:50] <helvetet> lilsammy: you could do it my way when wordpress is being annoying
[02:07:53] <helvetet> just load all scripts from cdn
[02:07:59] <helvetet> and dont enqueue them
[02:08:36] <helvetet> or remove the bit in the header and footer that allows for enqueued scripts to be loaded
[02:08:39] <helvetet> and it wont break admin
[02:09:19] <helvetet> lilsammy:  is your custom script that calls the waypoints using $ or jQuery?
[02:10:45] <lilsammy> Jquery
[02:10:57] <fRAiLtY-> Is there anyway this can be shortened or made more efficient? I'm not that good with js. It works fine though http://pastie.org/9587066
[02:11:06] <lilsammy> I have a small chunk of JS in this theme
[02:12:36] <helvetet> just laod cdn's and pretend like thats the proper way, that way jquery isnt in safe mode
[02:37:45] <fRAiLtY-> Can you do .animate({display:block},800);
[02:37:50] <fRAiLtY-> on a display:none element
[02:38:14] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you can't animate display:block
[02:38:33] <Cork> first change it to display:block with opacity: 0 or height: 0
[02:38:41] <Cork> and then animate opacity or height
[02:38:50] <Cork> (or width)
[02:59:57] <dokma> in IE8 content below div does not get pushed down when div is expanded
[03:00:04] <dokma> is this some known bug?
[03:01:36] <Cork> dokma: no
[03:01:50] <Cork> well not in that generic term
[03:01:59] <Cork> but something light cause a div to not be pushed down
[03:02:14] <Cork> it normally depend on the element (not the element not pushed down)
[03:03:15] <dokma> Cork, I didn't understand you very well
[03:03:20] <dokma> can you rephrase that a bit
[03:03:29] <Cork> dokma: the div isn't the cause
[03:03:37] <Cork> look at what should be pushing it down
[03:04:21] <fRAiLtY-> Is there anyway this can be shortened or made more efficient? I'm not that good with js. It works fine though  http://pastie.org/9587220
[03:04:27] <dokma> Cork, the div is getting expanded
[03:04:39] <dokma> the div is the one that should push stuff below itself down
[03:04:41] <Cork> dokma: ok, make a demo of the problem
[03:05:24] <dokma> Cork, you can see it live: www.prijevodi-online.net
[03:05:38] <dokma> just focus the 'Poruka' textarea
[03:05:52] <dokma> in IE8
[03:06:04] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you could combine the location updates in the keydown and click
[03:06:24] <fRAiLtY-> Cork? I can
[03:06:32] <D3N00> hi guys, do u know a ie8 metod for trasparent png?
[03:06:33] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: and use .show/.hide instead of .css('display'
[03:07:02] <Cork> D3N00: ugg, you would have to use the ms filter: activex thingy
[03:07:29] <Cork> D3N00: if you by transparent meant alpha transparent
[03:07:43] <Cork> transparent is supported since ie5
[03:08:39] <D3N00> because the .png have black edge
[03:09:16] <Cork> D3N00: alpha transparent isn't fully supported until ie9
[03:09:29] <D3N00> ok thk u :)
[03:09:39] <Cork> ie7 and 8 supports alpha transparent as long as you don't use css opacity on the element
[03:09:51] <dokma> Cork, funny thing is if I do F11 to switch to fullscreen in IE8 it redraws the content correctly
[03:10:08] <Cork> dokma: try the old zoom: 1; hack
[03:10:14] <Cork> it often fixes old ie bugs
[03:10:23] <dokma> never heard of it
[03:10:25] <dokma> will try
[03:10:50] <Cork> ?g ie haslayout zoom

[04:18:22] <definity> Hi
[04:19:44] <definity> If I am calling a function and i dont need to use all the argument only 1,2,4. would jquery know that i skipped 3?
[04:20:18] <Cork> definity: some jquery functions do
[04:20:37] <Cork> by testing the values of 3 and if the data is of the type that should have been in 4 it will move it there
[04:20:58] <Cork> api.jquery.com lists these as [value]s

[04:21:43] <definity> whopps
[04:28:31] <dANO> Hi, How I can refresh or reload only one tr in my table ?
[04:29:12] <Cork> dANO: you would have to fetch the tr from the server (ajax) and replace it
[04:30:23] <dANO> The .load function can't be used ?
[04:39:33] <shebbi> how to register same event to more than one element?
[04:40:31] <shebbi> I have an event handler function already set to one event. how to set it to another event without duplicarting code?
[04:41:59] <Cork> shebbi: normally the best choice is to delegate the event to a parent
[04:42:17] <shebbi> im thinking of using trigger
[04:42:28] <Cork> $('stable-and-shared-parent').on('event', 'selector-matching-the-targets', function() {});
[04:42:48] <Cork> shebbi: alternatively you can give all the elements in a list to $()
[04:43:12] <shebbi> 'selector-matching-the-targets'
[04:43:23] <shebbi> how to specify more than one selector here?
[04:43:29] <Cork> for example $('table').on('click', 'a', function() {})
[04:43:39] <Cork> shebbi: like any css selector
[04:43:53] <Cork> though you normally want to give them a class to target on
[04:44:13] <shebbi> I have two different tags
[04:44:20] <shebbi> one is <a>
[04:44:26] <Cork> shebbi: just list them

[04:45:58] <shebbi> you use class
[04:46:10] <Cork> uh
[04:46:11] <shebbi> but the HTML code has two different id
[04:46:28] <Cork> shebbi: please read up on css selectors
[04:46:43] <Cork> there is more then tags, class and id

[04:47:56] <shebbi> normally i would add class and be able to select the p and the a tag
[04:48:01] <Cork> especially how to list multiple selectors
[04:48:10] <Cork> or just ignore what i say
[04:48:12] * Cork walks away
[04:49:53] <shebbi> i read it and it's not on that page. you given me the right link cork?
[04:51:45] <Cork> hmm
[04:52:04] <Cork> ya, feels kinda like an oversight of the writer...
[04:52:25] <Cork> shebbi: to list multiple selectors for a css group you separate the different selectors with comma
[04:52:47] <Cork> it really should have been in that page though i can't find it...
[04:53:32] <shebbi> yeah well i almost went mad finding it. got out my magnifying glass...wth is this
[04:54:07] <Cork> i'll poke an editor and see if they could wip something up
[04:55:28] <bostonma1776> Hello guys

[04:56:38] <Cork> shebbi: so, editor poked
[04:56:52] <Cork> sorry about the goose chase
[04:57:24] <shebbi> Cork: I forgive you.
[04:57:31] <Cork> lol
[04:58:01] <Lorcatar> :)
[05:05:30] <definity> Can i select any div in JQ? even if i have selected another div
[05:05:50] <Cork> definity: ya
[05:05:56] <definity> Cork: Thanks :)
[05:06:11] <Cork> if you want to chain then you do something like $('selector1').find('selector2
[05:06:15] <Cork> *')
[05:06:36] <Cork> then the second selector will be in the tree structure under selector1
[05:08:35] <definity> Ah I see :)
[05:23:52] <dANO> It's possible to disable js function, if user click on button ?
[05:24:34] <Cork> dANO: that is what if statements are for

[05:24:55] <Cork> as in if(value) {} else {}
[05:25:19] <dANO> Oh , yes but no I can use statement
[05:25:51] <dANO> hum I guess i can but if i can just disable function is better.
[05:26:29] <Cork> dANO: you can't disable a function
[05:26:44] <Cork> you can choose to not call it or have it do nothing
[05:26:48] <Cork> but you can't disable it

[05:46:56] <brollypop> https://gist.github.com/lukaszdacyl/883acce26458dc00d8fd
[05:47:17] <brollypop> but it just instantly scrolls to the top of the site entirely
[05:47:30] <brollypop> not just to the top of the .span-center
[05:47:53] <brollypop> and id prefer it to scroll with some delay instead of instantly
[05:48:10] <brollypop> can anyone tell me what could i try changing
[05:52:46] <frank_o> brollypop: I'd highly recommend setting up a live testcase with codepen, jsfiddle, jsbin or whatever
[05:53:17] <shebbi> How do I pass a jQuery variable to PHP server when an click event is fired?

[05:57:25] <Cork> nisseni: you can't return data from a callback
[05:57:35] <Cork> as you will return the data to $.post not from getColor
[05:57:55] <Cork> nisseni: best option is to just return $.post
[05:58:07] <Cork> and use .done(function(color) {}) from where you called
[05:58:38] <nisseni> Cork: ok, thanks, will try that

[06:13:10] <ortund> guys, I'm having some issues with a modal-like expanding display of my screenshots at the bottom here... can anyone provide some insight? http://loganyoung.za.net/error-reporting-in-mvc/
[06:18:58] <eternityempire> I'm trying to create a scrolling website using Bootstrap 3 and Drupal. The scrolling part works just fine, but because all the links are anchors, Drupal recognizes all links as "active" and the states don't change, thus every menu item is highlighted all the time. Is this something I can change with jquery?  (e.g. remove all 'active' states on page load and bind an active state to the closest
[06:18:58] <eternityempire> scrolled section or something? )
[06:23:20] <marsjaninzmarsa> eternityempire: you can done it in pure CSS
[06:24:03] <marsjaninzmarsa> only for automatically change anchors while you scrolling page you are need jQuery

[06:32:27] <shebbi> how to do preventDefault() when you take the function out from $(...).on('click', myFunction );
[06:32:49] <shebbi> myFunction($arg1, $arg2){}
[06:38:44] <Cork> shebbi: same way
[06:39:12] <Cork> shebbi: myfunk(event) { event.preventDefault(); } $().on('click', myfunk);
[06:40:09] <shebbi> so i must use 'event' not 'e' in this case?
[06:40:41] <Cork> shebbi: myfunk(funky) { funky.preventDefault(); } $().on('click', myfunk);
[06:40:49] <Cork> the variable name doesn't matter
[06:42:06] <shebbi> does adding $ in front of name make it a variable? how to differentiate from the arguments i put in?
[06:42:32] <shebbi> like event/e or whatever could be an argument
[06:43:24] <shebbi> myfunk(e, $arg1, $arg2, ...)
[06:43:45] <shebbi> so without the $ jquery knows it's an event?
[06:44:00] <DeVito> performance question:
[06:44:00] <DeVito> If i refer to a specific element a lot is it better to store that element in a variable or just keep referencing it via $()
[06:45:16] <BillCriswell> DeVito: Variable.
[06:46:37] <Cork> shebbi: there is nothing magical about $, it is just a variable name just like any other
[06:46:49] <Cork> jquery doens't care if you use $ anywhere or not
[06:47:28] <shebbi> then how it differentiate from event and other variable? because you can;'t do $arg1.preventDefault();
[06:47:34] <ortund> Can someone help me out? I'm having some trouble with a modal - details on the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/re7gs978/
[06:47:36] <DeVito> thanks Bill
[06:47:48] <BillCriswell> shebbi: Yes you can.
[06:47:56] <BillCriswell> DeVito: No problem.
[06:48:54] <shebbi> huh? Do i use preventDefault() on all the args or just one and it will apply to them all?
[06:49:44] <BillCriswell> The first argument would be the event if you're using it for an event listener.
[06:51:50] <shebbi> right, makes sense now
[06:52:04] <shebbi> BillCriswell: Thanks bro
[07:02:02] <net2014> hello, appending text to a textarea is considered DOM manipulation, right?
[07:02:11] <Cork> net2014: no
[07:02:38] <Cork> as it doesn't modify the dom when you want to add data to a form field
[07:02:43] <Cork> it is a state change
[07:03:08] <net2014> Cork: ok, yes, but is still considered a dom operation?
[07:03:17] <net2014> at all?
[07:03:37] <net2014> ok, I think not
[07:04:22] <net2014> but is it still expensive in terms of that many of such operations, could make the browser unresponsive?
[07:08:16] <Cork> net2014: no it isn't
[07:08:31] <Cork> net2014: it doesn't create nodes, it doesn't have css effects on parts of the content
[07:08:41] <Cork> net2014: it is basically just a text buffer
[07:08:41] <net2014> Cork: I see, thanks.
[07:08:58] <Cork> net2014: selecting what field to add the text to and so on might be though
[07:09:01] <Cork> depending on the selector
[07:09:31] <Cork> net2014: and list anything else doing it a lot ex. on every keydown have a likelihood of making things lag
[07:09:38] <net2014> Cork: ah, ok, so $("#myTextarea") is expensive
[07:10:01] <Cork> net2014: that is the most inexpensive selector you can have
[07:10:10] <Cork> but yes it is even better to store it in a variable
[07:10:12] <Cork> and reuse it
[07:10:51] <net2014> Cork: thanks, what do you mean by "list anything else doing it"?
[07:13:17] <net2014> $var = 1 to JavaScript is as valid as var = 1?
[07:14:51] <net2014> Cork: Cork I don't get it, do you mean that if I have a text area and I append text to it very often during the lifetime of my app, could be expensive, because of the large amount stored in the text area?
[07:15:43] <Cork> net2014: var $a = 1; is a variable built of two characters $ and a
[07:15:50] <Cork> net2014: var a$ = 1; is a variable built of two characters $ and a the same
[07:15:58] <Cork> $ has no special meaning what so ever
[07:16:08] <Cork> if you enter it in a name it has to be there
[07:16:11] <Cork> you can't skip it
[07:16:16] <net2014> ok
[07:17:21] <net2014> appending text to an text area, pretty much on any function your run, and you can run functions as many times you want by pressing buttons, could be expensive because of the large amount of text stored in the textarea?
[07:18:18] <net2014> so, I may get to a point, where my text area hold like 1 MB, and everytime I append text to the textarea, I get to append that 1 MB + all new text
[07:19:18] <Cork> net2014: ouch.. yes that might be a problem
[07:19:30] <Cork> not so much cause of the modification
[07:19:34] <Cork> but the gc you cause
[07:27:52] <net2014> well, how much data should I keep in the text area, to keep my browser from becoming unresponsive?
[07:28:31] <Cork> net2014: that depends on a lot of things
[07:28:55] <Cork> net2014: what are you doing btw?
[07:29:12] <net2014> it's a small JS game
[07:29:33] <Cork> and the textarea is a log or something?
[07:29:39] <net2014> it's text based and keeps a log of what's is going in in a textarea, yes
[07:29:49] <Cork> ah
[07:30:26] <net2014> you can keep playing the game for ever
[07:30:31] <Cork> well the browser might be smart enough to optimize things away if you use +=
[07:30:56] <Cork> so you don't throw away the entire string buffer and create a new one
[07:31:21] <Cork> one mb of gc for every update could kill most anything
[07:31:32] <Cork> depending on how often you do it
[07:31:46] <Cork> once a minute for example most likely wouldn't matter
[07:32:12] <net2014> Cork what I am doing is $("#myTextarea").val( $("myTextarea") + message )
[07:32:23] <Cork> that won't work to start with
[07:32:36] <Cork> .val() + message
[07:33:00] <Cork> and ya, that most likely will create a completely new string buffer
[07:33:14] <net2014> eh, what I am doing is $("#myTextarea").val( $("myTextarea").val() + message )
[07:33:17] <Cork> actually, on second though it has to
[07:33:43] <Cork> .val() returns a string buffer + message creates a new buffer
[07:33:51] <Cork> and .val() then replaces the old one
[07:34:02] <Cork> so ya, it will create quite a bit of gc
[07:37:36] <net2014> Cork you mean that $selector = $("#myTextarea") actually caches the selection, so it won't have to run every time l use $selector?
[07:37:49] <Cork> net2014: the selector sure
[07:37:54] <Cork> but with 1mb of data
[07:38:03] <Cork> that is the least of your worries
[07:39:22] <net2014> Cork: I am thinking what to do with the textarea, one idea is to truncate the beginning of the text of the textarea, if the text gets to big in bytes
[07:39:51] <net2014> but I am not sure when to truncate, what would be the size of the text at which I would truncate
[07:40:12] <Cork> net2014: you most likely have to
[07:40:23] <Cork> though i would prob do it on number of lines instead
[07:40:44] <Cork> and what value to use can't really be told before hand
[07:40:59] <Cork> you basically have to guess at a high number and then adjust it to make things work
[07:47:41] <ortund> Cork, would you mind taking a look at this? My modal doesn't seem to work (I want to make a modal dialog out of the image that gets clicked)
[07:47:42] <ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/re7gs978/
[07:51:57] <wodim> how do i use the child selector on $(this) ?
[07:53:25] <Max-P> wodim, $(this).find() or $('selector', this) ?
[07:53:34] <wodim> hm
[07:53:36] <wodim> well thanks
[07:53:43] <wodim> i'll just find my way out of that
[07:53:51] <net2014> thanks Cork
[07:54:58] <andrew9183> ortund: first of all, you need to include jquery
[07:55:04] <andrew9183> if you want to use jquery
[07:55:14] <andrew9183> wodim: both works.
[07:55:26] <andrew9183> $('selector', this) means to find selector in the context of this
[08:01:33] <ortund> andrew9183, still don't get why jsfiddle doesn't load jquery as a default framework :/ ... any input on the comment on the jquery there?
[08:01:55] <andrew9183> because it is an option on the left
[08:01:58] <andrew9183> under framework
[08:02:04] <andrew9183> not EVERYONE uses jquery\
[08:03:48] <lilsammy> Can anyone see why this wouldn't work? var name = $(this).attr('name');
[08:03:48] <lilsammy>   $("a[href$=\""+name+"/\"]").addClass('current_page_item');
[08:03:59] <lilsammy> Its not getting links which contain "name"
[08:05:55] <andrew9183> that is incredibly messy
[08:06:56] <lilsammy> thanks ;) nvm got it working
[08:07:05] <lilsammy> should of been selecting the parent
[08:10:52] <zafu> hi, anyone using debian's ckeditor package?
[08:18:45] <StanAccy> If Ive created a jquery selector, is there a way to view/print the selector string?
[08:18:59] <StanAccy> (from the jquery object)
[08:19:18] <lilsammy> can't you use firebug / console.log(theobject)
[08:19:36] <lilsammy> the object being var object = $('.class');
[08:19:53] <StanAccy> lilsammy: Its printing something thats not helpful - namely "Object"
[08:19:56] <lilsammy> or however your selecting
[08:20:04] <StanAccy> I created the selector using $(#myElementId');
[08:20:11] <StanAccy> with an extra '
[08:20:13] <lilsammy> Are you viewing it in firebug?
[08:20:17] <StanAccy> Chrome
[08:20:31] <StanAccy> Im trying to print out some debug lines in a small JS
[08:20:43] <decx> it's literally .selector
[08:20:47] <lilsammy> oh not sure how that works in console on FF with firebug it lets you click a + and expand the object to view it all
[08:20:53] <StanAccy> decx: Thanks
[08:21:39] <xec> decx & stanaccy: that's deprecated in 1.7 and removed in 1.9
[08:21:47] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/selector/
[08:22:09] <Cork> ya, .selector was needed for .live
[08:22:20] <Cork> and when live died so did the need for .selector
[08:22:26] <StanAccy> xec: So I just readm but its working fine for me
[08:22:51] <StanAccy> I thought I was using 1.9.2
[08:23:12] <StanAccy> Im using 1.11.1
[08:23:46] <decx> just took the first best thing, what's even the usecase for needing the selector
[08:23:50] <xec> that's odd. i guess they decided not to remove it after all?
[08:24:04] <decx> ya it's right there in the jq object
[08:24:25] <StanAccy> decx: Just debugging
[08:25:31] <Cork> xec: it was removed for a while
[08:25:41] <Cork> i had code breaking cause of it
[08:27:16] <aitiba> hi
[08:32:20] <aitiba> I have this html and jquery code http://pastebin.com/vgHLWJj8. When I add some text to #buttonLang I call to ajax, return a json and print the result on the screen. I also change ul.pagination content. Then I click on a new "ul.pagination li a" but the 67 line event is not fired. ¿why? please
[08:32:51] <decx> read this: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[08:33:09] <robertmaxrees> yep.  can't bind to what isn't there.
[08:38:16] <stack> hi, does anyone knows a method to not hang the browser trying to load big images into canvases? I could need something like 30 images 1.5MB each
[08:38:50] <decx> dont load all of them
[08:39:14] <jiffe> anyone know a good component for displaying messages?  Maybe something simiar to a gmail thread
[08:39:28] <decx> ul
[08:42:10] <aitiba> decx: robertmaxrees so as I understand after read it the docs, I need a second paratemer on the new created element with the next elements? ON my case 'li a' ¿right?
[08:42:31] <robertmaxrees> aitiba you'd do $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() {});
[08:42:36] <robertmaxrees> parent needs to exist on pageload.
[08:42:44] <aitiba> $('ul.pagination').on('click','li a',function (e) {
[08:42:54] <robertmaxrees> does ul.pagination exist on pageload?
[08:43:20] <aitiba> robertmaxrees: yes
[08:43:29] <robertmaxrees> then you should be fine
[08:43:40] <aitiba> but li a exist on pageload too
[08:43:47] <aitiba> ul.pagination li a
[08:44:02] <robertmaxrees> right, but you're adding li a elements later onm right?
[08:44:04] <robertmaxrees> *on
[08:45:00] <aitiba> I change the ul.pagination li a later on
[08:45:03] <aitiba> pageload
[08:45:13] <robertmaxrees> wut
[08:45:23] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[08:45:39] <robertmaxrees> does ul.pagination just exist and you add stuff to it?
[08:46:10] <aitiba> ul.pagination on pageload exists with content
[08:46:29] <aitiba> http://pastebin.com/vgHLWJj8
[08:46:59] <robertmaxrees> right, and then you add/remove stuff to it, right?
[08:47:05] <robertmaxrees> like the thing that doesn't work
[08:47:36] <aitiba> yes
[08:47:44] <robertmaxrees> then that's what you want.
[08:47:56] <decx> dom is like a stack of papers
[08:48:06] <decx> when you do $('thatpaper') it looks in the stack
[08:48:24] <decx> when you add new papers into the stack then they didnt exist back when you looked into the stack first
[08:48:37] <decx> is that a good allegory
[08:48:38] <decx> ?
[08:49:01] <decx> na it's shit ^^
[08:49:01] <aitiba> how can I add new pages to the stack?
[08:49:09] <decx> anytime you add an element to the page
[08:53:12] <ortund> okay so I kinda have this working right, but there are some obvious problems... http://jsfiddle.net/re7gs978/2/
[08:54:25] <aitiba> decx: with append() too?
[08:55:05] <decx> well technically you can append an existing element but generally yes
[08:58:48] <ortund> http://jsfiddle.net/re7gs978/2/ anyone got any suggestions? This isn't quite working right (the modal background doesn't cover the whole page (just whats in view) and I'd like to scale the image down some, but have no idea how)
[09:05:13] <ortund> ...... nobody can/wants to help me with my stupid modals :(
[09:05:56] <decx> there are many many edgecases for a lightbox, use an active one where many hundreds of manhours are already invested
[09:06:19] <robertmaxrees> ^^ this
[09:06:34] <decx> if it's for educational purpose i will gladly nitpick all the wrong things ^^
[09:06:43] <Bhiugy> hello
[09:08:14] <ortund> decx so what you're telling me is "use something premade and don't bother improving on what you already know"
[09:08:18] <Bhiugy> http://jsfiddle.net/ausk0jv3/
[09:09:05] <robertmaxrees> ortund are you building the lightbox as an educational experience, or for a project?
[09:09:13] <decx> if you need a version that is ready for production use then you'll have many hours before you
[09:09:26] <Bhiugy> where can I substring the just the first4 chars of usdV1
[09:09:35] <robertmaxrees> Bhiugy that's not valid js btw
[09:10:26] <ortund> robertmaxrees, its for my site (which I pride on being all custom coded by me). Its not something I've done before so I was hoping to learn how by doing it
[09:10:53] <decx> well then let's get to it
[09:11:12] <robertmaxrees> ortund then you have a loong, arduous road ahead of you.  the first thing you should do is learn to overlay a div on your entire page - you shouldn't set that container's style using CSS.
[09:11:16] <robertmaxrees> err, using JS, I mean.
[09:11:26] <robertmaxrees> use CSS as much as possible and only use js to show/hide it.
[09:11:54] <decx> generally you want an anchor to the fullsize version and a thumbnail on the src
[09:12:27] <decx> and what did you thought when you did $(".modalDialog").removeClass("modalDialog");
[09:12:32] <decx> did you think*
[09:14:38] <ortund> decx that's old code
[09:14:47] <ortund> I hadn't looked before I posted it
[09:16:15] <ortund> as for the css, I had the top/left coded in the css previously, but that was of the page as a whole, not the window
[09:17:29] <robertmaxrees> ortund you want a singular div that overlays all your content, and/or you want to set overflow: hidden; on your stuff so the window doesn't scroll any more.
[09:21:44] <scrubfest> Trying to use a html5 audio api visualizer, but this guys blog is kind of hard ot read: http://www.cnblogs.com/Wayou/p/html5_audio_api_visualizer.html . Anyone used it before?
[09:22:02] <scrubfest> It's currently drag 'n drop, but I want to have a file ready onload
[09:22:23] <decx> it's probably hard to read because audio vis is mental
[09:22:40] <ortund> robertmaxrees, overflow: hidden; on the modal window?
[09:23:12] <robertmaxrees> on the body, ortund
[09:30:12] <ortund> guess I might as well use lightbox because nobody can give a straight answer around here... fuck this
[09:31:18] <decx> good riddance
[09:31:21] <scrubfest> decx, also because it's in Chinese :p
[09:31:33] <decx> scrubfest yeah the page didnt load for me at first ^^
[09:31:48] <decx> the code is pretty straight forward to my surprise
[09:32:03] <decx> https://github.com/wayou/HTML5_Audio_Visualizer/blob/master/js/html5_audio_visualizer.js
[09:32:09] <scrubfest> Needless to say I don't know javascript very well
[09:32:51] <scrubfest> It works fine. I just want to tweak it to load a file of my choosing instead of the user-input it is currently doing
[09:32:58] <robertmaxrees> ortund i gave you a straight answer.
[09:33:14] <ortund> go fuck yourself decx... clearly you've forgotten that you actually had to learn this shit too, at one stage
[09:33:27] <ortund> robertmaxrees,  you gave me pieces of an answer
[09:33:30] <decx> i wasnt such a bitch about it ^^
[09:33:43] <robertmaxrees> ortund what do you want from me?
[09:33:51] <ortund> we can't all be perfect little cunts decs, stfu
[09:34:10] <robertmaxrees> thaaat's enough of that.
[09:34:11] <scrubfest> decx, what I tried: https://bpaste.net/show/04f1e79e7fbc
[09:34:26] <decx> hm looks about right
[09:35:01] <scrubfest> Getting a typeerror from line 123 in the doc u sent
[09:35:20] <scrubfest> Looks like this: "Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'readAsBinaryString' on 'FileReader': The argument is not a Blob."
[09:36:17] <decx> it looks to be pretty hardwired
[09:36:24] <decx> maybe you'll have to edit the source
[09:37:57] <definity> If I go $("*").fadeIn(1000); surley that should fade evreything in onLoad right?
[09:38:13] <decx> you dont want to do that at all
[09:38:17] <definity> y?
[09:38:26] <decx> because that'll start a shitload of timers
[09:38:38] <decx> fadeIn a parent
[09:38:40] <BillCriswell> Fading in a parent would also fade in all it's children.
[09:38:48] <BillCriswell> Damn scrolling.
[09:39:21] <decx> you missed out on entitlement BillCriswell
[09:39:38] <definity> I do want evreything to fade in though. is it still bad practise? should i fade evreything in one by one?
[09:39:57] <BillCriswell> decx: Damn.
[09:40:02] <robertmaxrees> definity overlay a div and animate opacity on it instead.
[09:40:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah that guy was kind of weird.
[09:40:15] <BillCriswell> decx: Al, just scrolled up.
[09:40:18] <decx> and we totally helped
[09:41:23] <BillCriswell> decx: fadeIn the body, or some .wrapper element. No need to target them all directly.
[09:41:27] <BillCriswell> Er, definity*
[09:41:42] <BillCriswell> Again with tab complete making me look like a dumb dumb
[09:41:52] <decx> eh, nothing new
[09:41:57] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[09:43:43] <BillCriswell> No need to remind me.
[09:44:53] <uskerine> hi, I am downloading a document using: document.location.href='download...';
[09:45:06] <uskerine> is there any way to capture a 500 server error?
[09:48:52] <definity> robertmaxrees: Thanks for the help :)
[09:49:00] <robertmaxrees> absolutely.  glad to do it :)
[09:50:15] <robertmaxrees> well that was an eventful morning.
[09:52:21] <robertmaxrees> it's amazing how much maturity people suddenly seem to gain after they get quieted.
[09:52:43] <decx> well fok u 2 poopyface
[09:57:39] <decx> man this audio analyzer stuff is ridiculous
[09:58:01] <decx> so many functions in there
[09:58:56] <definity> I have a problem, I'm pretty new to this JQuery malarki And im not sure the best way of putting it to good use. Now becuase im new to this lib evreything seams amazing and I just want to use it all on one site, But thats bad practise. im not sure when im over using it or using it just right. Any tips?
[10:00:03] <robertmaxrees> that's a tough one.
[10:00:23] <robertmaxrees> use the toolset because you have a goal in mind.  don't use it just to use it.
[10:00:25] <robertmaxrees> that make sense?
[10:00:53] <decx> i'd say use it all and figure out all the stuff you dont actually need on the way
[10:01:22] <shoky> take some adderall
[10:01:42] <decx> just dont do $('*').fadeIn() ^^
[10:01:52] <robertmaxrees> hahah
[10:02:56] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ this is a pretty good resource, too.
[10:14:37] <robertmaxrees> oh hey shoky is around.
[10:15:25] <definity> robertmaxrees: yeah it does thanks :)
[10:15:45] <definity> ha adderall is the last thing i need, I have aspergers, so my focus is non stop
[10:19:05] <Diplomat> hey guys.. any ideas what might be wrong. I'm loading json using $.get into a pre tag which belongs to ACE editor.. but every time I do it it crashes and throws an error "Script: http://192.168.106.128/panel/js/jquery.js line 2 > eval:1". Any ideas what might be wrong ?
[10:19:06] <shoky> heya duch
[10:19:29] <Diplomat> http://puu.sh/bKRc5/e36ac5084e.png that kind of error
[10:19:43] <robertmaxrees> how've you been?
[10:20:36] <Cork> Diplomat: is the json request cross domain?
[10:20:41] <Diplomat> nope
[10:20:49] <Cork> big blob of json?
[10:21:20] <Diplomat> http://pastebin.com/YXXLCGqf that's my code
[10:21:42] <Diplomat> I don't think it's very big
[10:21:59] <Cork> hmm
[10:22:06] <Diplomat> around 56 rows, but they are short rows
[10:22:15] <Cork> Diplomat: the error you get basically only points at that something is running in eval
[10:22:30] <shoky> been rather bored, duch. not enough work lately ;p how you doing with your new nick :p
[10:22:35] <Diplomat> So maybe it's that ACE editor's issue ?
[10:22:51] <Cork> Diplomat: are you using a minified jquery.js?
[10:22:53] <Diplomat> http://ace.c9.io/ this one
[10:22:57] <Diplomat> yes, it's minified
[10:23:04] <Cork> try loading an uncompressed version
[10:23:06] <robertmaxrees> hahaha, been digging on it ;)
[10:23:08] <Diplomat> hmm
[10:23:15] <Cork> might make it easier to find where it hangs
[10:23:19] <Diplomat> true, one moment
[10:23:23] <Cork> as everything won't be on line 2 :)
[10:23:46] <shoky> ;)
[10:24:41] <Diplomat> Weird, now it didn't crash
[10:25:14] <Diplomat> Now it did, one moment
[10:25:24] <Diplomat> Script: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.js line 338 > eval:1
[10:26:14] <Cork> ya, suspected as much
[10:26:28] <Diplomat> http://pastebin.com/eWjsebLG this now
[10:26:34] <Cork> some js is sent most likely as response to an ajax call
[10:26:47] <Cork> and it is then evaled by jquery in its globaEval function
[10:26:48] <Diplomat> hmm yes
[10:27:21] <scrubfest> What am I doing wrong if I get: "Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'readAsBinaryString' on 'FileReader': The argument is not a Blob."
[10:27:28] <Diplomat> im loading pages over ajax.. and sometimes pages have javascript in them
[10:27:48] <Cork> Diplomat: try to see if you can run the page without ajax
[10:28:00] <Cork> cause eval is a good way to hide all browser row info :/
[10:28:20] <robertmaxrees> Diplomat also, i'd refactor stuff to see if you could avoid having js in the pages and instead linked via external scripts.
[10:28:32] <Cork> true
[10:28:33] <Diplomat> yup already working on it
[10:28:45] <DeVito> is it bad practice to have js on the page instead of in its own file?
[10:28:45] <DeVito> for example I have a few on click events that I only want to trigger on a single page. Should this be externalized or is it fine on that one page ?
[10:29:23] <robertmaxrees> really depends, but i'd externalize them as a "default"
[10:31:00] <Cork> DeVito: it is quite nice to write the selectors in a common file, but only have the selector match where it is needed
[10:31:18] <Cork> DeVito: then you don't need to have js scattered around the place
[10:31:25] <Cork> makes it much easier to maintain
[10:32:25] <robertmaxrees> the other way to do it is have some basic asset management that includes your library/utility files everywhere and then your page-specific files as needed.
[10:32:54] <DeVito> ahh ok
[10:32:57] <DeVito> that makes sense
[10:33:05] <Cork> that micght have problems with overhead in some network situations though
[10:33:09] <robertmaxrees> depending, yeah.
[10:33:12] <Cork> (depending on the size of the files)
[10:33:17] <DeVito> there tiny
[10:33:22] <DeVito> lest than 100 ln's
[10:33:39] <Cork> loading 10+ files with one event handler in most likely isn't efficient
[10:33:39] <robertmaxrees> we do as much dynamic inclusion as possible here.
[10:34:21] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i meant - we include files on pageload as needed by the page.
[10:34:31] <Cork> robertmaxrees: how do you handle 3g connections then?
[10:34:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm talking our desktop platform.  our mobile platform is a completely different frontend stack :)
[10:34:56] <Cork> ah
[10:35:24] <Cork> ya, for desktop (unless they are on 3g connections) shouldn't have a problem with that
[10:35:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:35:44] <robertmaxrees> we new relic to keep an eye on all of that.
[10:35:47] <robertmaxrees> fantastic tool.
[10:35:55] <Cork> especially if split over multiple domain names
[10:36:29] <robertmaxrees> we also make good use of a CDN for all of our sites.
[10:36:40] <Cork> there you go :)
[10:36:58] <robertmaxrees> we know what we're doing and where we could be doing better :D
[10:37:35] <Cork> knowing is half the battle
[10:37:42] <Cork> well more like 80% :)
[10:37:48] <Diplomat> Hmm.. i made it worse now
[10:37:54] <Diplomat> I put that JS to header
[10:38:18] <Cork> Diplomat: hmm might be you trigger an event listener in a loop or something like that
[10:38:39] <Cork> but ya, until you get that eval out of the way you won't really know
[10:40:32] <abisheksrikaanth> could someone advice if this code is correct and advice on what it does?  `$('[data-element="ITEM-OTHER-PRODUCT"][data-selected="true"]', otherProducts),`
[10:41:02] <robertmaxrees> it should work in theory, though I wouldn't use data-* attributes for selection.
[10:41:26] <abisheksrikaanth> robertmaxrees, does the $ selector take 2 params?
[10:41:27] <robertmaxrees> that looks for an element with both of those data attributes/values within the otherProducts object.
[10:41:36] <Cork> abisheksrikaanth: it searches for elements with data-element and data-select set to those two values and exist as a child of otherProducts
[10:41:51] <robertmaxrees> yes - that's a shortcut for otherProducts.find('[data-element="ITEM-OTHER-PRODUCT"][data-selected="true"]')
[10:42:09] <abisheksrikaanth> ok, where can i find the docs for that. I never knew that was possible
[10:42:12] <decx> put a tagname before that attribute selector for a better perf
[10:42:24] <Cork> at least ya
[10:42:25] <robertmaxrees> abisheksrikaanth https://api.jquery.com/jquery/
[10:42:27] <Cork> or better yet classes
[10:42:42] <decx> specifically https://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery-selector-context
[10:42:45] <robertmaxrees> and like I said, don't select on data attributes.  give those a class to select on.
[10:42:50] <Cork> abisheksrikaanth: those are quite normal css selectors
[10:43:03] <Cork> they work the same way they work in any css file
[10:43:55] <Cork> well actually don't select on any attribute value unless you have no other choice
[10:44:05] <Cork> it isn't just a bad idea for data-* attributes
[10:44:11] <robertmaxrees> right
[10:44:23] <abisheksrikaanth> Cork, that is 2 params to the $ class, never used it
[10:44:31] <robertmaxrees> *function, not class :)
[10:44:32] <Cork> ah
[10:44:45] <Cork> ya, $() has a lot of shorthands
[10:44:53] <Cork> it has some for .attr too
[10:44:59] <Cork> and .ready and what not
[10:45:01] <robertmaxrees> *.prop() iirc.
[10:45:12] <Cork> its kinda a freak monster
[10:45:16] <abisheksrikaanth> Cork, so it does $( selector [, context ] )
[10:45:30] <robertmaxrees> abisheksrikaanth yep, which uses .find() under the hood.
[10:45:36] <abisheksrikaanth> ok
[10:45:39] <decx> it's like a swiss army knife with embedded oven
[10:45:40] <robertmaxrees> so it's like context.find('selector')
[10:47:17] <Cork> hmm what was that site that let you link to jquery functions again...
[10:47:34] <decx> github? ^^
[10:47:57] <robertmaxrees> api.jquery.com? :D
[10:48:17] <decx> jsfddle !
[10:49:07] <Cork> robertmaxrees: no
[10:49:09] <Cork> anyway https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core/init.js#L53
[10:49:19] <Cork> line 61
[10:53:31] <unnu> Hi #jquery, Anyone know a decent tut for populating a dropdown via xml? google isn't helping as much as id like.
[10:56:57] <Cork> unnu: you mean a <select>?
[10:57:20] <unnu> yeah Cork
[10:57:38] <unnu> its for a state / county dropdown for leads
[10:57:38] <Cork> unnu: it would be similar to how you would do it with json
[10:57:54] <Cork> you take the structure loop it and create dom elements
[10:57:57] <unnu> select state, pop options under counties from xml
[10:58:02] <unnu> hrmmm okay
[10:58:03] <Cork> put those into an array and then insert them in one go
[10:58:10] <unnu> ill take a whack at it
[10:58:13] <unnu> thanks Cork
[10:58:28] <Cork> unnu: jquery can help you loop the xml if you don't already know this
[10:59:22] <unnu> oh yeah
[11:00:26] <unnu> i got a structure like <state><name>alabama</name><counties><county>blah</county><county>blah</county>
[11:00:28] <unnu> you get it
[11:00:30] <unnu> lol
[11:01:07] <Cork> so $(xml).find('countries country')
[11:01:33] <Cork> with possibly some state in there :)
[11:01:44] <Cork> ...
[11:01:49] <Cork> *counties
[11:02:02] <Cork> similar but not the same -_-'
[11:02:20] <unnu> lulz
[11:06:07] <Cork> HA!
[11:06:11] <Cork> found it
[11:06:22] <Cork> robertmaxrees, decx: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/
[11:07:11] <decx> Cork++ that is incredibly convenient and i've never seen it
[11:07:36] <robertmaxrees> oh this thing.  yeah it's pretty cool.
[11:08:15] <unnu> THATS COOL
[11:08:19] <unnu> (favs)
[11:08:27] <Cork> i wish they kept a full version of the compiled jquery file in github
[11:08:33] <Cork> that would have been enough
[11:08:47] <Cork> but linking to lines is quite complicated without that site
[11:09:01] <decx> yeah searching functionname: isnt that great on git
[11:09:17] <decx> "let me show you these 50 hits in test files"
[11:09:30] <Cork> well it is mostly that they split it up over so many files
[11:09:53] <Cork> and not to mention folders
[11:15:49] <unnu> GAHHH buggers. is there something like jsfiddle that i can load an external xml file?
[11:15:56] <unnu> or can i , and i am just doing it wrong?
[11:18:02] <Cork> unnu: you can as long as the remote server allows it
[11:18:17] <unnu> kay
[11:25:10] <starlord> Is there a more concise way of doing this? https://gist.github.com/sdegutis/ae89bd748750b7c65441
[11:25:44] <robertmaxrees> use .on() instead of .bind()
[11:26:34] <robertmaxrees> but because of the way you're traversing the document, that's about as good as it gets.
[11:28:13] <unnu> so Cork, i wanna load the XML doc, use parseXML to save it to a var, then .find() the state. how do i get the child elements of it and itterate through them?
[11:28:58] <Cork> unnu: you use jquery on it basically like you do on a dom element
[11:28:59] <starlord> Thanks robertmaxrees.
[11:29:07] <Cork> $(xml).find('selector')
[11:29:31] <unnu> oh
[11:29:42] <unnu> . . . . . now i feel SUPER stupid
[11:29:52] * unnu facepalms
[11:57:13] <r2d2__> hi guys
[11:58:08] <DeVito> dont you mean "beeeeeep boop bep boop"
[11:58:11] <r2d2__> i need to disable an area temporarily.. but if i use .off() i cannot reach elements behind it
[11:58:25] <r2d2__> how can i accomplish that?
[12:03:40] <BillCriswell> Hmm.. wonder why there isn't a bootstrap channel.
[12:04:11] <BillCriswell> Oh, there ishaha
[12:08:05] <Paradisee> how can i send json data to a file.json?
[12:22:19] <NoiseEee> Paradisee: hmmmm?
[12:22:53] <Paradisee> NoiseEee: i have to make some json data, and write them to a json file
[12:23:24] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/1NGEGMN
[12:23:29] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee you can't do that via jquery - you need a server-side technology of some kind.
[12:23:35] <NoiseEee> uh ok where is this data coming from?
[12:23:51] <Paradisee> actually the json file is: {}
[12:24:20] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee is this file on a server somewhere?
[12:24:26] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: ya
[12:24:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then you need some kind of server-side platform setup to handle that.
[12:24:47] <robertmaxrees> you can't write using jquery like that.
[12:25:06] <mdev> is jquery safe now
[12:25:07] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: well, it's pretty easy to manage on the server
[12:25:10] <mdev> seriously what the heck
[12:25:20] <Paradisee> but how can i send the data to it?
[12:25:21] <mdev> jquery.com that is
[12:25:28] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee you can use $.post()
[12:25:41] <NoiseEee> mdev: think so, yeah
[12:25:44] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: ill give a try
[12:25:53] <mdev> I just downloaded jquery earlier today
[12:26:08] <mdev> whoever runs tis security needs to get it together, reads some books or something
[12:26:12] <mdev> not hard to not get hacked
[12:26:19] <NoiseEee> mdev: host your own jquery.js
[12:26:22] <NoiseEee> like any sane developer
[12:26:25] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: the request should be made by ajax
[12:26:33] <mdev> I don't use their version but I do go there to get latest releases
[12:26:37] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee $.post() uses $.ajax() under the hood.
[12:26:44] <robertmaxrees> you can also use just $.ajax() to post it instead.
[12:26:49] <Paradisee> ya i will
[12:35:01] <s5fs> mdev: I run infrastructure for jquery.
[12:35:51] <robertmaxrees> hey s5fs - i'll bet you've been having a busy day :)
[12:35:59] <robertmaxrees> sorry to hear about what happened.  can't be fun.
[12:36:27] <s5fs> robertmaxrees: indeed, lots of misinformation flying around, people need to check their sources. I expect we'll have a statement out later today.
[12:36:50] <s5fs> In any event, jQuery.com is fine. The CDNs are fine.
[12:37:05] <s5fs> My receeding hairline, not so much ;)
[12:37:09] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:38:01] <BillCriswell> What happened? Someone get something bad in jquery?
[12:40:40] <robertmaxrees> something about a script getting injected onto the homepage.
[12:40:45] <robertmaxrees> apparently.
[13:08:07] <radicalbiscuit> I have a jQuery Mobile question: I have a selectmenu that has a legitimately blank valued option (value=""). This triggers the option to be used as the placeholder, even if I give it the attribute data-placeholder="false". Is there any way I can prevent this from happening?
[13:11:11] <starlord> If I have a jQuery object representing 10 things, and another one representing a subset of only 7 of them, is there an easy way to get another subset of the remaining 3?
[13:11:24] <starlord> I got the subset using .filter() btw.
[13:12:53] <decx> inverse filter with .not(filtered)
[13:13:40] <starlord> Oh, nice. Thanks :)
[13:15:14] <starlord> Is there a way to turn this function into a selector?   function(el) { return $(x).attr('data-mystuff')   === 'yes'; }
[13:15:44] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't
[13:15:47] <starlord> I would normally do 'foo["data-mystuff"]="yes"' but I don't know what I'd put as "foo".
[13:15:52] <starlord> Why not?
[13:15:56] <robertmaxrees> selecting on data attributes is slow.
[13:16:01] <robertmaxrees> and can be unpredictable.
[13:17:11] <starlord> Oh.
[13:19:54] <starlord> Well, we are talking about using jQuery...
[13:19:59] <starlord> I don't really think speed is on anyone's mind.
[13:20:06] <robertmaxrees> jquery can be plenty fast.
[13:20:20] <robertmaxrees> select on classes/IDs if possible.
[13:20:41] <decx> hm
[13:20:50] <starlord> Oh.
[13:21:17] <decx> does jquery cache datalist on load or on selection?
[13:22:08] <decx> if it already has a reference to an element in cache it could be possible to speed up selection with data attributes
[13:22:28] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea.
[13:23:33] <decx> dataset not datalist
[13:23:36] <decx> -.-
[13:27:49] <shoky> it copies the data attributes the first time you call $.fn.data for an element
[13:28:00] <robertmaxrees> that makes sense.
[13:35:49] <radicalbiscuit> I have a jQuery Mobile question: I have a selectmenu that has a legitimately blank valued option (value=""). This triggers the option to be used as the placeholder, even if I give it the attribute data-placeholder="false". Is there any way I can prevent this from happening?
[13:40:59] <robertmaxrees> radicalbiscuit $.mobile.selectmenu.prototype.options.hidePlaceholderMenuItems = false;
[13:41:01] <robertmaxrees> try that?
[13:41:47] <radicalbiscuit> robertmaxrees: Doesn't this disable the placeholder for all select menus?
[13:41:49] <starlord> Is there a shortcut for this?  $($(sel.get(0)).nextSibling)
[13:42:00] <starlord> (where sel is a jQuery selection of objects)
[13:42:12] <robertmaxrees> starlord use .eq() instead of .get()
[13:42:24] <robertmaxrees> $(sel).eq(0).nextSibling
[13:42:41] <robertmaxrees> radicalbiscuit yep.  wasn't sure if you wanted to disable on all of them or not.
[13:42:44] <BillCriswell> I think you just want .next() ?
[13:42:56] <robertmaxrees> ^ oh yeah do that, too, instead of nextSibling
[13:43:02] <starlord> Excellent!
[13:43:16] <BillCriswell> or .eq(2)
[13:43:25] <BillCriswell> or .eq(3), etc
[13:43:38] <radicalbiscuit> No, I was looking for a more granular way of disabling them. Looks like the blank value method of specifying a placeholder will be removed from jQM in 1.5, though. Which is good.
[13:43:56] <radicalbiscuit> I think I'll deal with it. I overcame a related problem so I don't care as much about this one now.
[13:44:20] <robertmaxrees> radicalbiscuit you should be able to do it by passing hidePlaceholderMenuItems as an option in the config object for .selectmenu()
[13:44:38] <radicalbiscuit> Thank you!
[13:44:41] <radicalbiscuit> \quit
[13:44:45] <zwischenzug> hello....wondering if it's possible to get the height of an h3 element.  $(".container h3")[0].height() says "Undefined is not a function"
[13:44:58] <robertmaxrees> zwischenzug you want .eq(0), not [0]
[13:45:12] <robertmaxrees> [0] accesses the underlying dom node, which doesn't have a height() method
[13:45:30] <zwischenzug> ahhh.....ok.  that works.  thanks robertmaxrees
[14:01:53] <DobreJoe> Is there a way to get the location coordinates in an embedded Google Map? I’m trying to validate when the user has changed the default location on the map
[14:06:29] <starlord> My code using JavaScript + jQuery is 3 lines shorter than my code using ClojureScript + Dommy.
[14:06:37] <starlord> (Before any compilation on either.)
[14:07:05] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:07:23] <robertmaxrees> i've kind of given up on SLOC for any metrics tbh
[14:13:14] <starlord> They're almost transliteratedly equal.
[14:14:49] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:15:25] <starlord> My ClojureScript code is surprisingly nearly identical to my JavaScript code.
[14:15:29] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[14:39:33] <scrubfest> Filereader.onload is called after a file is successfully read?
[14:44:07] <robertmaxrees> scrubfest according to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader, yes
[14:45:07] <scrubfest> Thanks :)
[14:46:04] <scrubfest> I am trying to read an file and it gets a typeerror, but the onerror function from the filereader is not called. How come?
[14:46:25] <robertmaxrees> dunno.  might have more luck in ##javascript maybe?
[14:47:17] <scrubfest> They are so... mentory :p Not giving me answers just showing me the way to find them. :(
[14:47:18] <scrubfest> Hehe
[14:47:31] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of how we like to be here, too...
[14:47:41] <scrubfest> Most channels do tbh
[14:48:32] <santy> Hi..  I have a page loaded via ajax . Inside that page there is a button. I want to invoke the ajax success on the button and perform a ajax callback..
[14:48:39] <scrubfest> In #javascript the other day I believe one member was banned from the channel for giving a straight answer to a straight question :)
[14:48:57] <oreille> I am likely out of line asking for something that may seem quite stupid or very basic to you.  I have been trying exhaustively looking for a script that will allow me to create the following:  -Create a text box, where my viewer would type in their zip code number. -That zip code number would part of a URL, and completes that URL -Then they hit a “go to” button -They would be sent to that html file, or URL, and that html file or UR
[14:49:07] <santy> but ajax callback function that am writing on ajax success is not working
[14:49:38] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ santy
[14:49:38] <b-ot> santy: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:50:36] <robertmaxrees> oreille there's not going to be any kind of prerolled script for that.
[14:50:44] <robertmaxrees> but we can help you figure it out :)
[14:51:35] <oreille> Am I out of line, with my request for help finding where to start looking?
[14:51:54] <robertmaxrees> oreille not at all.  do you have any code yet?
[14:52:13] <oreille> No, not yet
[14:53:43] <oreille> I can write well in Coda, and I am better than a beginner
[14:53:49] <robertmaxrees> mmk.
[14:57:48] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you need to start with an input and a link, right?
[14:59:50] <oreille> robertmaxrees Yes, I think that is what I am after
[15:00:05] <robertmaxrees> mmk.  go to g)

[15:00:08] <robertmaxrees> woops!
[15:00:14] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/ this
[15:00:26] <robertmaxrees> there we go haha.  setup a starting fiddle :)
[15:02:46] <oreille> robertmaxrees: Did you suggest going to jsfiddle.net to me?
[15:02:51] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:05:14] <oreille> robertmaxrees: I will check it out. May be over my head for now, but I need to learn. Thanks
[15:11:01] <robertmaxrees> oreille err... i thought you wanted help, but ok.
[15:11:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/e4s3ycbp/5/ this is the basic beginnings for it.
[15:12:16] <tocka> hi guys..
[15:13:13] <robertmaxrees> gooood afternoon :)
[15:13:33] <oreille> robertmaxrees: I do want help. I have joined jsfiddle, and hive hit your link
[15:14:13] <tocka> just wanted to ask.. I have been looking round for a plugin like this http://bit.ly/1pr3tkz if you would click on one of those green markers you would see a popup appear next to it
[15:14:25] <tocka> or maybe someone has any ideas how I could make one using jquery ui? :(
[15:14:28] <oreille> robertmaxrees: Wow, thank you!
[15:14:30] <tocka> thanks!
[15:15:59] <tocka> hmm :|
[15:16:11] <robertmaxrees> tocka why not look at how that site in particular does it?
[15:16:24] <tocka> that is a good idea I guess :)
[15:16:41] <tocka> Thought about asking here, maybe someone was in need of this kind of thing also
[15:16:46] <tocka> and could give me a clue:)
[15:17:12] <robertmaxrees> sure - the source of that page shows you how it's done.
[15:17:17] <robertmaxrees> handlebars templates and all.
[15:17:25] <robertmaxrees> is this for use with google maps?
[15:17:54] <tocka> mapbox
[15:18:03] <decx> you want marker clustering?
[15:18:07] <tocka> mapbox + leaflet
[15:18:09] <tocka> oh no :)
[15:18:12] <tocka> i have that covered already
[15:18:20] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need some kind of tooltip plugin for that, then.
[15:18:27] <tocka> hm..
[15:18:40] <tocka> I was looking at qTip2
[15:18:51] <robertmaxrees> i like powertip personally, but i'm a little biased.
[15:19:00] <tocka> lets see :)
[15:19:17] <robertmaxrees> i know the dude that wrote it.
[15:19:31] <tocka> cool! :D
[15:20:34] <tocka> does that plugin have an option for the tooltip to adjust to screen? I mean to show it automatically on left/right depends how much space is there
[15:20:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:20:57] <oreille> robertmaxrees: No, it is related to water districts, and finding their respective water districts, so they may sign up for water quality alerts, as well as paying their bill.
[15:20:59] <robertmaxrees> it does smart placement by default iric
[15:21:22] <robertmaxrees> oreille kay
[15:21:48] <tocka> OOO
[15:21:51] <tocka> nice! :D
[15:24:07] <oreille> robertmaxrees: You're a champ. Thanks one hell of a lot. If you can check out member ID, and info on JSFiddle, I used the same username.
[15:43:17] <scrubfest> What's this structure for: name.prototype { method: {}, method: {}, method: {};  };
[15:43:53] <systemfault> That's not valid code.
[15:44:00] <systemfault> Is a = missing?
[15:44:32] <scrubfest> Talking to me?
[15:44:33] <scrubfest> :)
[15:44:48] <systemfault> Yes
[15:44:49] <scrubfest> Oh yes
[15:44:54] <scrubfest> What's this structure for: name.prototype = { method: {}, method: {}, method: {};  };
[15:44:56] <mdev> what do you guys use to minimize?
[15:44:56] <scrubfest> *
[15:45:03] <mdev> I tried something and messed things up somehow
[15:45:25] <systemfault> scrubfest: It's just a way to declare functions/variables on the prototype.
[15:45:36] <litropy> Some browsers, including latest Safari for iPhone, seem as though they can't parse the HTML from an XML object. But I hope it's something else ... .done(function( data ) { $("#mydiv").html( $(data).find(info).html() )}) returns nothing, yet changing .html() to text() returns what I want, without of course the HTML. Again, it works fine on Chrome and FF for Ubuntu.
[15:45:46] <systemfault> scrubfest: Instead of name.prototype.method = function() {}; name.prototype.method2 = function() {};
[15:45:48] <litropy> Same for Chrome/android
[15:45:51] <scrubfest> Is the prototype similar to a class?
[15:45:56] <scrubfest> a* prototype
[15:46:25] <systemfault> scrubfest: It's different... in fact, JS's OOP is prototypal.
[15:47:11] <systemfault> scrubfest: Everything that is on the prototype is going to be shared among all the instances constructed using the constructor function
[15:47:46] <litropy> I just have a bunch of <p> random text </p> within a singular <info></info>
[15:47:47] <rj46> hi! is this still the best solution http://stackoverflow.com/a/1043281 ? I got few divs which depends on selected option
[15:48:28] <robertmaxrees> use .prop() instead of .attr(), but the basic idea is solid.
[15:49:14] <rj46> robertmaxrees: ok thanks, I wa just wondering if these    $('#form1, #form2, #form3').hide(); is not deprecated
[15:49:14] <tw2113> i got to use prop() earlier, it was awesome
[15:49:29] <tw2113> .hide() is still available
[15:49:33] <robertmaxrees> rj46 $() can't really be deprecateed lol
[15:49:52] <robertmaxrees> and .hide() is totally legit.  the api docs will tell you when something's deprecated.
[15:50:06] <rj46> robertmaxrees: i meant that, you hide manually all divs in $()
[15:50:16] <tw2113> yes, multiple selections still work
[15:50:16] <scrubfest> Looking at this code, a guy is doing: var that = this, is there any good reason to do this?
[15:50:29] <tw2113> caching the this value
[15:50:38] <scrubfest> aha
[15:50:39] <robertmaxrees> scrubfest caches "this" into something and helps it maintain context in child functions.
[15:50:42] <robertmaxrees> when you refer to that.
[15:50:56] <tw2113> or as gnarf calls it, a selfie
[15:51:00] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[15:51:03] <robertmaxrees> eeexact;y/
[15:51:16] <robertmaxrees> same reason you'll sometimes see var $this = $(this);
[15:51:16] <tw2113> var selfie = this
[15:52:22] <tw2113> https://twitter.com/tw2113/status/514547768942030848
[15:52:22] <b-ot> tw2113: @tw2113: How can you tell if a js developer is a hipster? He uses "var selfie = this;"
[15:57:18] <decx> coffeescript doesnt need var
[15:57:30] <robertmaxrees> :( coffeescript doesn't need to exist.
[15:57:38] <tw2113> so they add them automagically? or they just put everything in global scope?
[15:57:41] <decx> would be a better hipsterjoke
[15:58:02] <decx> like a hipster would write in a language that isnt transcompiled to js afterwards
[15:58:04] <decx> cmon
[15:58:16] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:58:45] <robertmaxrees> decx+-
[15:58:57] <decx> i have no feelings one way or the otherf
[15:59:04] <decx> -f
[15:59:36] <robertmaxrees> "<decx> i have no feelings[...]"
[15:59:46] <decx> well i am german sooo
[15:59:52] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[16:00:28] <robertmaxrees> when do you sleep btw?
[16:00:35] <robertmaxrees> or do you live at night?
[16:00:37] <decx> in an hour or so
[16:00:44] <decx> 1am now
[16:00:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah i know.
[16:00:58] <robertmaxrees> i had a girlfriend back in the day who did a semester in prague
[16:01:44] <robertmaxrees> so i learned how to convert in my head relatively quickly
[16:02:15] <decx> i can do new york
[16:02:25] <decx> what's wc, like 3 hours earlier
[16:02:31] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:04:40] <decx> that guy you kicked earlier queried me after a while complaining that he cant call me cunt without being kicked
[16:05:20] <robertmaxrees> he was really upset about it because I "inconvenienced" him
[16:05:24] <decx> showed him how we gave him couple of hints
[16:05:28] <decx> and then get this
[16:05:34] <decx> should have saved it
[16:05:47] <decx> "zuckerberg didnt build facebook with a couple of hints"
[16:05:53] <robertmaxrees> =/
[16:05:59] <decx> "larry page dint buildt google with a couple of hints"
[16:06:04] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:06:06] <decx> had to invoke ignore right then
[16:06:06] <robertmaxrees> :(
[16:06:24] <robertmaxrees> i didn't even kick him haha
[16:06:27] <robertmaxrees> gave him a quiet.
[16:06:47] <decx> lol
[16:06:56] <decx> didnt even realize that was a thing
[16:07:30] <robertmaxrees> he kept messaging me afterwards about stuff and then still tried to get my help.
[16:07:39] <robertmaxrees> after insulting me a whole bunch.  it was very strange.
[16:07:50] <decx> not bad
[16:08:08] <decx> that approach works for my girlfriend
[16:08:14] <decx> jk
[16:08:24] <robertmaxrees> hahaha.
[16:10:03] <robertmaxrees> meh.  sometimes people get upset.
[16:10:40] <decx> was probably proud for caching selectors and we shot it down -.-
[16:10:46] <decx> "you totally didnt validate me"
[16:10:55] <tw2113> she didn't like your selfies?
[16:12:37] <decx> just chilling <3 - - 5 hours of striking poses to find the perfect spontaneous selfie

[18:12:28] <Imaginativeone> Is there a tool for observing the contents of my wrapped set?
[18:16:40] <Imaginativeone> Is there a tool for observing the contents of my wrapped set?
[18:16:56] <shoky> what do you mean?
[18:18:23] <shebbi> Imaginativeone: try console.log()
[18:19:38] <Imaginativeone> shebbi not available
[18:20:18] <Imaginativeone> The console is not available
[18:21:14] <Imaginativeone> Any other ideas?
[18:24:58] <uskerine> what is a wrapped set?
[18:28:16] <Imaginativeone> A wrapped set is the resulting object/element list
[18:28:53] <Imaginativeone> When you apply jQuery to a selector
[18:31:38] <BillCriswell> Imaginativeone: So you want to be able to do somethin like var $items = $('.item'); $items.somethingChanged(function () { ... });
[18:33:36] <aitiba> hi
[18:34:29] <aitiba> If I have an object defined on a file and included on a html file, How can I call to a method of that object please?
[18:42:56] <shebbi> HOw to show script errors on IE?
[18:49:54] <BillCriswell> aitiba: How are you including the html file?
[18:50:49] <aitiba> BillCriswell: <script src="/js/paginator.js"></script>
[18:51:35] <BillCriswell> aitiba: You have HTML in that file?
[18:52:08] <aitiba> on the file that I call to that object.method yes BillCriswell
[18:53:33] <BillCriswell> aitiba: I'm a little confused. It sounds like you're answering your own question.
[18:55:43] <aitiba> BillCriswell: I have this object and call
[18:55:57] <aitiba> I get this error: TypeError: box.init is not a function
[18:57:13] <BillCriswell> Is init a function and is there an object named box?
[18:57:59] <aitiba> i'm not sure. Is the first time that I play with objects on jquery BillCriswell
[18:58:37] <BillCriswell> aitiba: There hasn't really been anything related to jquery.
[19:02:48] <sammych1> jQM: say if I have an event to validate a page form before leaving it (pagecontainerbeforechange). If it fails, I'll present a popup to the user to ask if they want to continue, or go back and fix. If the user opts to continue, a callback will be fired with .trigger('pagecontainerbeforechange', [original_event, original_ui]). That successfully calls the handler again, except the page isn't changing
[19:03:25] <sammych1> oh
[19:03:32] <sammych1> yeah, never mind
[19:23:52] <ljdevs_> hey does anyone here use typeahead?

[23:36:43] <shebbi> delete <p> and replace with <a>
[23:37:05] <Cork> shebbi: .replace
[23:37:07] <aagii> Is anyone ever use MMENU ?
[23:37:13] <shebbi> Cork: thanks
[23:37:14] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com replace
[23:37:15] <b-ot> Cork: .replaceWith() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/
[23:39:29] <shebbi> Cork: OK that works.
[23:41:47] <aagii> Is anyone who know MMENU ?
[23:50:27] <shebbi> Cork: I have a simple string that I echo from an AJAX callback function like echo "Hello World". Does this data need to be json_encoded() even if it's a simple string passed back to the javascript?
[23:50:52] <Cork> shebbi: no
[23:51:06] <Cork> at least if the content-type is text or similar
[23:51:17] <Cork> text/plain or text/html
[23:51:25] <Cork> (text/html is the default)
[23:51:59] <shebbi> Cork: More for arrays and objects I guess?
[23:52:11] <Cork> structured data ya

[23:57:27] <lilsammy> trying to make the browser scroll till an element is near the top am I along the right lines?
[23:57:27] <lilsammy> $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $(moreinfo).offset().top+($(window).height())}, 2000);
[23:57:51] <lilsammy> its scrolling too much but I take it I can use the window height minus some pixels?
[23:58:43] <Cork> lilsammy: you do + window height
[23:58:53] <Cork> so no that won't put the element at the top
[23:58:55] <lilsammy> Thanks thought minus was acting odd
[23:59:03] <Cork> you shouldn't have it at all
[23:59:26] <Cork> $('html, body').animate({scrollTop: $(moreinfo).offset().top }, 2000)
