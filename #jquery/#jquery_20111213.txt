[00:09:29] <coldhead> __machine: i think if you declard var i = 0; outside the livequery function and then inside have if (i++ > 100) return; that would work
[00:09:44] <coldhead> but maybe not -- livequery might be painful before you even get into your fn
[00:10:10] <jbooker> thanks Cork
[00:16:04] <__machine> coldhead: i checked the available events and i dont think there is any that will fire when an object is first added to the dom... i tried ready, load... i think this is why i used livequery in the first place... :( . tried $('table > * > td').delegate(':first-child', 'load', function() { $(this).addClass('first-child'); }); ... nothing happens...
[00:35:09] <kolix> Hi guys
[00:35:21] <kolix> I'm trying to do line cotinuation in javascript.
[00:35:25] <kolix> What am i doing wrong? - http://pastie.org/3009313
[00:36:26] <aaronmcadam> kolix: just don't do it that way
[00:36:38] <kolix> how can id o it then?
[00:36:53] <aaronmcadam> ?eval ['this', 'is', 'my', 'concatenated','string'].join(' ')
[00:36:54] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: "this is my concatenated string"
[00:37:00] <aaronmcadam> that's how
[00:37:01] <kolix> wtf?
[00:37:12] <aaronmcadam> it's faster
[00:37:12] <Zogot> no lol
[00:37:26] <kolix> come on dude
[00:37:28] <aaronmcadam> what?
[00:37:30] <kolix> I'm not doing that
[00:37:34] <aaronmcadam> it's easier to read too
[00:37:38] <kolix> what's the line continuation characyer
[00:37:55] <aaronmcadam> fair enough, I hate html strings split up like that
[00:38:06] <kolix> well I'm nott hat advanced yet
[00:38:11] <aaronmcadam> uh
[00:38:15] <aaronmcadam> k.
[00:38:23] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/5uYQ8/
[00:38:32] <blackspotwiggins> http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=js+line+continuation
[00:39:03] <aaronmcadam> it's cuz ur mixing + and \
[00:39:16] <kolix> so if i want to break up a single line of code into multipule lines i just.....start writing code on a new line?
[00:39:28] <Zogot> yep
[00:39:37] <kolix> cool
[00:40:04] <aaronmcadam> I would use the + operator instead of \
[00:40:08] <aaronmcadam> if I had to
[00:40:18] <aaronmcadam> can be very hard to read
[00:41:00] <Zogot> aye i normally just do the + at the start of the new line

[01:07:45] <ignaciogiri> hello, anybody awake?
[01:09:10] <amcsi_work> hello
[01:09:32] <amcsi_work> $(document).on('mouseup', handler); doesn'T run :/
[01:09:36] <ignaciogiri> hello amcsi_work
[01:09:52] <ignaciogiri> you think you can help me build this? http://jsfiddle.net/eGSdc/
[01:11:02] <xec> amcsi_work: should work, do you get any errors in console?
[01:11:16] <amcsi_work> noncs
[01:11:44] <amcsi_work> oh yea, the mouseup event is registered in the mousedown of an element
[01:12:04] <amcsi_work> and the mouseup runs when mouse gets released inside that element
[01:12:15] <ignaciogiri> here I explain what I'm trying to achieve http://jsfiddle.net/eGSdc/1/
[01:12:16] <amcsi_work> even though I bindid it to $(document)
[01:13:35] <ignaciogiri> get the idea?
[01:14:39] <xec> ignaciogiri: there's no javascript/jquery in your example?
[01:14:44] <DukeDrake> he
[01:14:56] <ignaciogiri> xec: no, there isn't, that's why I'm here :)
[01:15:35] <xec> ignaciogiri: we're not going to write your project for you, if you want to learn jquery i suggest you go through some tutorials or read a book
[01:16:09] <ignaciogiri> xec: ok, let me write till my knowledge and I will go back
[01:20:12] <amcsi_work> hmm
[01:20:18] <amcsi_work> okay
[01:21:06] <amcsi_work> so mouseup fires when in the element of what mousedown wall called for. or, when i click without moving the mouse
[01:21:07] <amcsi_work> weird
[01:22:02] <amcsi_work> in fact, I said it wrong. the first sentence isn't true
[01:23:14] <xec> the "hmm"?
[01:23:34] <sarmiena_> how do a get an instance of a custom widget I created? i.e var foo = $('#bar').myWidget() <-- returns $('#bar')
[01:23:56] <sarmiena_> but I want to get a reference to the widget so i can call methods on it
[01:24:05] <amcsi_work> ah, returning false in mousedown made evrything work! why?
[01:24:34] <amcsi_work> AH THE BROWSER'S DRAG AND DROP STUFF
[01:24:39] <amcsi_work> oh sorry capy
[01:24:41] <amcsi_work> caps :D
[01:24:47] <xec> sarmiena_: if you made the plugin, couldnt you make it return what you want?
[01:25:07] <sarmiena_> xec: sec let me show you the pattern i used
[01:25:43] <xec> amcsi_work: if you put a mouseup handler on document, it will fire if you click wherever. returning false will prevent bubbling
[01:26:30] <sarmiena_> xec: http://pastie.org/3009435
[01:26:33] <amcsi_work> I mean I put a return false in the mouseup event in which the mouseup binding gappens
[01:26:56] <sarmiena_> if I add return this at the end of _create function i don't get what i want
[01:27:43] <ignaciogiri> xec: check this http://jsfiddle.net/eGSdc/1/
[01:28:16] <xec> ignaciogiri: that's the same link as before
[01:28:21] <ignaciogiri> xec: sorry, I forgot to save - http://jsfiddle.net/eGSdc/2/
[01:30:35] <mbrochh> how can i iterate over all elements with an id starting with foo?
[01:30:57] <mbrochh> $('#foo*').each(function(index){}) doesn't seem to work?
[01:31:46] <xec> sarmiena_: right, i havent used the .widget() approach before, but i found this: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[01:32:09] <xec> sarmiena_: where it says: Plugin instance accessible via $( "#something" ).data( "pluginname" )
[01:32:22] <mbrochh> ah got it
[01:32:35] <sarmiena_> xec: agh i missed that. thanks!
[01:34:01] <AdvoWork> i'm passing a class name to a function, and there are multiple <selects> with the same class. I'm trying to change all of them. I'm doing: $('.'+table+'').prepend('<option id="'+currval+'" selected="selected">'+new_record+'</option>'); where table is the class name, but its only doing the one. Any ideas how I can do multiple please?
[01:35:39] <xec> ignaciogiri: to "start over" you could select all anchors and check current position vs length, and do .first() on the collection rather than .next() on the current
[01:36:13] <ignaciogiri> xec: makes sense
[01:38:06] <xec> and seeing as your value on checkbox is the same as the content on the links you can select on that to do the selecting
[01:39:00] <Cork> AdvoWork: prepend only adds to the first element in the selector
[01:39:05] <Cork> AdvoWork: you need to use .each
[01:41:08] <fRAiLtY-> Hi, on my website, http://www.trustedprint.co.uk/ I have an automated menu system that is created by Magento depending on categories etc. I want to disable the top level link so just the drop down links are active, basically any links in the top menu I wish to disable.

[01:47:43] <ColKurtz> #frailty
[01:48:03] <ColKurtz> $("#nav > a').on('click', function(){ return false; }
[01:48:10] <ColKurtz> that selects the immediate a child
[01:48:26] <Cork> you should avoid using return false
[01:48:33] <Cork> use event.preventDefault instead
[01:48:36] <ColKurtz> sigh
[01:48:46] <ColKurtz> function(e){ e.preventDefault(); }
[01:48:59] <ColKurtz> why avoid using return fales, Cork?
[01:49:13] <ColKurtz> curious to learn :)
[01:49:17] <ColKurtz> i know it prevents event bubbling
[01:49:19] <Cork> cause it will stop the event loop, so if you bind two event listners to the same event
[01:49:29] <Cork> that one bound last is the only one that is ever executed
[01:49:33] <ColKurtz> ahhh
[01:49:41] <ColKurtz> thanks for the explanation.
[01:49:45] <Cork> np
[01:50:18] <Cork> anyway what was your original question? :)
[01:51:24] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Hi, on my website, http://www.trustedprint.co.uk/ I have an automated menu system that is created by Magento depending on categories etc. I want to disable the top level link so just the drop down links are active, basically any links in the top menu I wish to disable.

[01:53:13] <ignaciogiri> xec: hey, check this http://jsfiddle.net/eGSdc/3/
[01:53:24] <fRAiLtY-> Cork, ColKurtz : That appears to have stopped the drop-down effect but the links still work...
[01:53:51] <fRAiLtY-> I want to retain the drop down but prevent the parent of the drop-downs being clickabe
[01:54:25] <ColKurtz> frailty use e.preventDefault()
[01:54:27] <ColKurtz> not return false
[01:54:34] <ColKurtz> as cork so kindly pointed out
[01:54:47] <xec> ignaciogiri: heheh, i didn't know gay and lesbian were genders
[01:55:00] <ignaciogiri> xec: hehe, me either, just testing
[01:55:09] <ColKurtz> $("#nav > a').on('click', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); // do the rest of your drop-down stuff}
[01:55:33] <ColKurtz> oh and on only works for jquery 1.7_
[01:55:36] <ColKurtz> 1.7+

[02:01:25] <NotStooge> hello is there a way to dinamically get the window width and if the window is resized to dinamically change the size of a div?
[02:02:06] <ravenzz> yep, but you should success using percentages width
[02:02:15] <xec> ignaciogiri: http://jsfiddle.net/eGSdc/4/
[02:02:30] <deleted> someone can help me?
[02:02:45] <ignaciogiri> xec: oh, that works
[02:03:06] <xec> ignaciogiri: just make sure that male is selected to begin with
[02:03:23] <ignaciogiri> yup
[02:03:32] <ignaciogiri> xec: well, thanks, I'm done
[02:06:25] <NotStooge> when the page loads i get the size of the div and resize it with a few px. But how to make it if the window is resized to resize the div again. From the div width i am resizing many many things inside the div. And failed using %

[02:15:31] <donCams> can I scrape data from textarea input using jQuery? teach me :)
[02:19:29] <AdvoWork> I have 2 select elements with the class name test_types, and im doing $('.'+table).prepend('<option id="'+currval+'" selected="selected">'+new_record+'</option>');  table is "test_types" but it doesnt actually do anything. Any ideas please?
[02:19:48] <AdvoWork> Cork, ahh i didnt see your reply before
[02:20:23] <Cork> :)
[02:21:27] <AdvoWork> Cork, do you mean like:  $('.'+table).each(function(){ $('.'+table).prepend('<option id="'+currval+'" selected="selected">'+new_record+'</option>'); } ?
[02:22:05] <Anime> donCams: $("textarea[name='thattextarea']").text()
[02:22:58] <Anime> or any other selector/attribute name you might wanna use to get to that textarea in specific
[02:23:02] <donCams> Anime: lol. no. i mean if I put some html elements inside a textarea, i want to scrape it
[02:23:09] <Anime> oh
[02:23:21] <Anime> .empty()?
[02:23:30] <donCams> like if I have a bunch of hidden inputs inside the textarea, i want to get the values of the hidden inputs. guess i'll use php domdocument instead
[02:23:34] <Anime> scrape means to delete, right? lol
[02:24:12] <Anime> extract the data inside and use a regex to select whatever you want
[02:24:35] <AdvoWork> hmm, unfortunately  $('.'+table).each(function(){$('.'+table).prepend('<option id="'+currval+'" selected="selected">'+new_record+'</option>');}); doesnt work Cork
[02:24:48] <lucian> hello. i'm using http basic to auth to an API

[02:25:41] <donCams> lmao regex. nvm :3 thanks
[02:27:31] <codeho> morning
[02:27:33] <Servercrash> hi i have a variable foo, which contains html content, now i want to iterate over all the input elements in variable foo, is this the right way $(foo input).each(function()....
[02:28:42] <codeho> foo.find('input').each i suppose if your variable foo is already a object containing elements
[02:28:57] <ravenzz> ^
[02:29:01] <Servercrash> hmm
[02:29:04] <ravenzz> or $('input', foo)
[02:29:05] <Slartibart> prevAll(), prev(), next(), nextAll() should have about the same speed regardless of whether there's 1k or 100k elements in my HTML, right?
[02:29:12] <EdwardIII> hey
[02:29:12] <ravenzz> but find() is faster iirc
[02:29:21] <Servercrash> let me test them both
[02:29:22] <codeho> yup
[02:29:28] <EdwardIII> trying to illustrate my problem in jsfiddle but i don't think i can use jquery ui stuff in it? http://jsfiddle.net/QWUj3/
[02:29:36] <codeho> however, you don't really need to add it to a variable first
[02:29:48] <ravenzz> depends
[02:29:55] <codeho> just do $('#id_of_parent_element_of_input_thinggies').find.....
[02:30:11] <AdvoWork> any reason why $('.'+table).each(function(index) { wouldnt be working, when table is my class name of my select element? is there anything else I need to do?
[02:30:31] <ravenzz> if he is going to use it more than one time, he should 'cache' it
[02:30:38] <codeho> ravenzz: true.
[02:31:05] <ravenzz> AdvoWork do you need the index?
[02:31:27] <codeho> Servercrash: just out of curiosity, what are you doing with the input's within that loop?
[02:31:32] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Ok getting somewhere, why does this: <li class="level0 nav-1 parent" onmouseover="toggleMenu(this,1)" onmouseout="toggleMenu(this,0)" onclick="return false"> not trigger the toggleMenu items but does the onclick. If I remove the onclick the toggle works?
[02:31:43] <ravenzz> fRAiLtY- don't use inline style/js
[02:32:09] <fRAiLtY-> ravenzz: It's produced from a php file within a framework, it's not that I've used it specifically.
[02:32:15] <fRAiLtY-> I have little choice the way the framework is designed
[02:32:47] <ravenzz> can't you edit it?
[02:33:08] <fRAiLtY-> Nope, it's dynamic.
[02:33:26] <fRAiLtY-> Where is the problem do you know?
[02:33:51] <EdwardIII> ah, here we go
[02:34:13] <EdwardIII> so how can i make the hidey content load hidden without breaking the width: toggle?
[02:34:16] <AdvoWork> ravenzz, i dont think so, im literally trying to prepend, like  $('.'+table).prepend('<option id="'+currval+'" selected="selected">'+new_record+'</option>'); to all select elements with a classname of what I pass, call it "types" as a test
[02:34:20] <ravenzz> boh I am not familiar with those kind of things because I hate them
[02:34:21] <fRAiLtY-> Presumably the return false is overriding the toggle?
[02:34:47] <fRAiLtY-> Can I address an <a> element specifically for return false?
[02:34:48] <AdvoWork> ravenzz, even when i do $('.types').each(function(index) {	alert("test"); } it wont alert, so i dont know why its not getting into there
[02:35:00] <EdwardIII> if i just set width: 0 it breaks the toggle, and if i set display: none it loads weirdly because it's shrinking rather than expanding
[02:35:33] <ravenzz> is there any value stored in the table var?
[02:35:38] <ravenzz> AdvoWork ^
[02:36:04] <Servercrash> $(tmp_html).find('input').each(function() {	var new_id = $(this).attr('id') + "_" + counter ; $(this).attr('id',new_id); });
[02:36:04] <Servercrash> $("#section").append(tmp_html);
[02:36:21] <Servercrash> i am trying to append input ids by adding dynamic number to it
[02:36:38] <AdvoWork> ravenzz, table alerted is basically "types" its the name of my class
[02:36:50] <Servercrash> and then append that html to my page, but in the above code i am unable to get the updated id
[02:37:03] <ignaciogiri> xec: fancy final touch http://jsfiddle.net/eGSdc/5/
[02:37:10] <Servercrash> instead i am getting the old content of tmp_html ...
[02:37:19] <Servercrash> any idea how to get the updated dom?
[02:40:59] <Servercrash> codeho, ravenzz ^^^ ???
[02:41:43] <ravenzz> so AdvoWork are you trying to do this http://jsfiddle.net/rPztb/ ?
[02:41:59] <ravenzz> Servercrash what?
[02:42:14] <ravenzz> ah let me read the question
[02:43:00] <ravenzz> Servercrash well, take a look at the example i made for AdvoWork http://jsfiddle.net/rPztb/
[02:43:12] <Servercrash> ok,
[02:43:24] <ravenzz> you want the id to be something+CurrendIndex
[02:43:27] <ravenzz> right?
[02:44:24] <Servercrash> ravenzz, yes
[02:44:49] <ravenzz> eh sometimes i wonder if you read the docs :p
[02:45:09] <ravenzz> jQuery.each( collection, callback(indexInArray, valueOfElement) )
[02:45:18] <Servercrash> ravenzz, the code works fine if i use with some page dom element,
[02:45:42] <ravenzz> $.each($(tmp_html).find('input'), function(i, e) { });
[02:46:00] <ravenzz> i is the index (the *counter*) e the current element
[02:46:09] <Servercrash> hmm
[03:02:34] <James13433> great, simple alert() doesnt work with no errors or reason why! 2 days of finguring out here I come :|
[03:05:59] <djcoin> Hi all
[03:06:05] <James13433> Hi
[03:06:37] <djcoin> Is there a way to get the element target in this case: form.live('submit')
[03:07:05] <djcoin> e.target reference the form, which is quite normal I guess, and not, one of the many 'submit' button that are in the form
[03:07:18] <djcoin> I want to know which one was actually clicked, is there a way to do that ?
[03:08:03] <tan044> Whats the best way to loop through only divs inside another div with a spesific id using .each?
[03:08:55] <djcoin> .originalEvent.originalTarget it seems
[03:11:29] <IvanKuzev> tan044: 'div#divid div' as a selector...and then each
[03:11:40] <djcoin> Its ok, I know how to handle it anyway: by putting more 'live' handler for each submit
[03:15:36] <IvanKuzev> good day. everyone
[03:16:18] <djcoin> whats the difference between $([ array of '#element' ]) and $('#elem1', '#elem2') ?
[03:16:21] <djcoin> Good day
[03:16:23] <djcoin> :w
[03:16:38] <AdvoWork> ravenzz, your example worked, but it added the options at the bottom and didnt select them if you get me, ive tried doing this with .prepend($(this)); instead of your append, but it removes the elements lol?
[03:18:23] <IvanKuzev> djcoin: i cant think of a one functional diference...both work the same .look is only diferent
[03:19:34] <ravenzz> AdvoWork prependTo ?
[03:21:03] <djcoin> IvanKuzev: in fact give him an array and it will just wrap it as object in a special jQuery array, but wont look for css identifier etc. -> objects are the same but wrapped
[03:26:51] <Daghdha> Any reason why $("#" + o.srcElement.id)[0].click(); would work in IE and not in Chrome?
[03:26:59] <Daghdha> been trying everything
[03:27:41] <Daghdha> if i alert("#" + o.srcElement.id); i see the right id
[03:28:36] <xec> Daghdha: what is the [0] doing there
[03:29:09] <xec> Daghdha: that will return a DOM element, not a jQuery object, and i doubt you can call .click() on it
[03:29:25] <Daghdha> in IE i can
[03:29:52] <Daghdha> like i say i been trying anything.. i started with o.srcElement.click(); wich worked in IE.
[03:30:06] <Daghdha> But chrome don't like it
[03:30:47] <xec> Daghdha: i cant say why .click() works in IE, but you can try something like $(o.srcEelement).click()
[03:31:57] <xec> assuming you have a handler attached to the click event
[03:32:36] <Daghdha> its an <a>
[03:32:52] <Daghdha> You gonna make me very saad now?
[03:33:23] <xec> iirc .click() will only trigger "click" events, not follow links
[03:33:28] <Daghdha> :(
[03:33:44] <Daghdha> IE will.. IE is so clver.
[03:33:47] <Daghdha> too clever
[03:34:00] <Daghdha> Ok so what i do is set location href with property of link?
[03:34:00] <xec> but if that is the case, you could always get the href attribute and shove it in the window.location
[03:34:08] <Daghdha> ok
[03:34:33] <Daghdha> Thank you.
[03:37:47] <EdwardIII> s/clever/bizarre/
[03:40:05] * Daghdha hugs xec
[03:40:21] <Daghdha> Finally.. i can go to sleep :P
[03:41:07] <xec> heheh "go to sleep" and then "g'day" ? :D
[03:42:13] <xec> must've been working all night
[03:45:45] <EdwardIII> hey chaps any idea how i can make this be closed when the page is first viewed without breaking toggle?
[03:45:48] <EdwardIII> http://jsfiddle.net/QWUj3/1/
[03:47:10] <Wiggin> can't you just make $(".inner").hide()
[03:48:39] <Wiggin> EdwardIII: or $('.inner').css('display','none');
[03:51:20] <EdwardIII> ah, that does work!
[03:51:29] <EdwardIII> weird, tried lots of combinations but not that one
[03:51:30] <EdwardIII> cheers Wiggin
[03:51:58] <Wiggin> mmh you're welcome
[03:54:57] <EdwardIII> Wiggin: although it seems to just fadein then rather than slide out: http://jsfiddle.net/QWUj3/1/
[03:57:12] <EdwardIII> Wiggin: http://jsfiddle.net/QWUj3/2/ rather
[03:57:50] <Wiggin> is width:toggle valid?
[03:57:56] <xec> it it just me or is jsfiddle really really slow at the moment
[03:58:08] <Wiggin> it's not just you
[03:58:17] <EdwardIII> Wiggin: for animate - if you click the link you can see it in action
[03:59:53] <Wiggin> if you want it to slide out, you have to toggle width at the beginning
[04:00:07] <Wiggin> so replace the display:none thing with     $('.inner').animate({width:'toggle' },0);
[04:00:52] <Wiggin> or you could use $('.inner').animate({width:'toggle' },0).css("display","none"); if you want both
[04:02:13] <Wiggin> or, really, $('.inner').animate({opacity: 'toggle',width: 'toggle',},0);
[04:02:16] <Wiggin> whatever floats your boat
[04:02:43] <EdwardIII> Wiggin: ah, that works a treat
[04:03:03] <EdwardIII> Wiggin: http://jsfiddle.net/QWUj3/3/ # success
[04:03:29] <Wiggin> good for you :D
[04:05:11] <AdvoWork> if im doing things like: var foo = $('<option/>').attr('id', currval).val(new_record).text(new_record).prependTo($(this));  what is it to set it as selected?
[04:06:07] <Wiggin> why not paste it into an editor and try it >_>
[04:06:25] <donCams> hello
[04:06:34] <jDog> how can i get autocomplete (UI) to work with multiple words?
[04:06:44] <jDog> what's the simplest way
[04:06:54] <donCams> how can i set the value of a textarea field that is hidden by .hide()
[04:07:13] <jDog> same as you would when it's not hidden
[04:07:48] <donCams> hmmm. i wonder...
[04:07:55] <donCams> must be something wrong with my code. thanks
[04:08:05] <jDog> i'm guessing
[04:08:25] <Wiggin> jDog: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/824144/how-do-i-use-jquery-autocomplete-for-multiple-words
[04:08:32] <jDog> i mean, i'm guessing you can set while hidden the same way
[04:08:42] <Wiggin> you should be able to
[04:08:43] <donCams> btw, $('#someId').children('child1, child2').html(someVal); is valid?
[04:09:31] <Wiggin> donCams: I think you need to add .each
[04:09:55] <donCams> hmmm. it worked
[04:09:57] <donCams> :3
[04:10:04] <Wiggin> haha
[04:10:59] <donCams> no. i mean even without .each
[04:11:05] <Wiggin> mmh
[04:11:22] <Wiggin> I just read the docs and found out you didn't need it so yeah :P
[04:11:57] <donCams> i always forget that I can select multiple domelements with the jQuery selector
[04:13:17] <Wiggin> AdvoWork: what exactly are you trying to do?
[04:24:19] <shwaiil> hi ppl
[04:24:36] <Wiggin> hello
[04:24:50] <IvanKuzev> hi
[04:25:29] <shwaiil> Q: I have a class called hidden (display:none), I have a action for add and remove this class. I find that, if I removeClass('hidden') and then try to addClass('hidden'), it wont work. Any reason why ? This same addClass with any other class name, works just fine.
[04:25:34] <shwaiil> Thanks for looking
[04:26:08] <Servercrash> anyone using validationEngine plugin for validating form elements, i am having problem in using it with dynamic form elements
[04:26:27] <Servercrash> if i add new row elements to form, the validationEngine plugin doesnt applies the validate rules on them
[04:27:08] <crab> shwaiil: do you know about .hide() and .show() and .toggle()?
[04:27:19] <Wiggin> yeah you really should be using that
[04:27:24] <Servercrash> i tried to detach validationengine prior to adding the new form element, and then re intiated the attach call, it just doest validates newly added html elements in a form
[04:27:40] <Servercrash> http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/jquery-form-validator-because-form-validation-is-a-mess/
[04:28:08] <Wiggin> shwaiil: are you using an inspector to check if classes are being added?
[04:28:10] <Servercrash> can anyone suggest similar simple to implement form validator that can handle dynamic form elements that are added on runtime / dynamically
[04:28:11] <denysonique> Is 'ajax' file uploading as simple as using an iframe?
[04:28:15] <shwaiil> crab: I know about it, yeh. but I have to stick with inner style ?!
[04:28:21] <durin> has anyone ever had a problem with colorbox where an iframe doesn't fill the wrapper?
[04:28:31] <shwaiil> Wiggin, I was using .delegate and then addClass, with .live it works
[04:29:29] <shwaiil> hmm fixed, error in the delegate I guess
[04:29:31] <shwaiil> tks sorry
[04:29:32] <crab> denysonique: you should check out the jquery-form plugin.
[04:30:35] <denysonique> crab: I am already using backbone.js, I don't want to mess up my forms etc
[04:31:05] <AdvoWork> if i have a select element, with loads of options, if i know the id of one of the <options> how can i set that option as selected?
[04:31:11] <Wiggin> Servercrash: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3519862/jquery-validation-engine-doesnt-live-validate-if-i-add-a-element-after-page-wa this doesn't work?
[04:31:38] <crab> denysonique: well, you should check out the jquery-form plugin anyway. even if you don't use it, you can see how to make uploads work reliably from its code.
[04:31:51] <denysonique> ok
[04:32:16] <AdvoWork> is it like $('.selDiv option[value="SEL1"]') ?
[04:32:40] <denysonique> this is really awesome btw: https://github.com/valums/ajax-upload
[04:33:54] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork skip the quote on [value=sel1]
[04:34:14] <danheberden> IvanKuzev that's not recommended btw
[04:34:35] <IvanKuzev> really....damn i shoud check the w3c
[04:34:37] <AdvoWork> IvanKuzev, thanks loads
[04:35:09] <danheberden> IvanKuzev more of a jq/qsa thing - although the spec recommends it iirc
[04:35:24] <danheberden> like, should work without - but a good habbit
[04:36:26] <Cork> IvanKuzev: no you should normally quote the value in the selectors
[04:36:48] <IvanKuzev> okay...will put quotes in the future
[04:36:52] <crab> why?
[04:37:16] <Cork> IvanKuzev: cause then you don't have to handle situations where you forget them when they'r needed
[04:37:21] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[04:37:24] <Cork> crab: ^
[04:37:49] <Cork> like when you select on name fields where you have characters that collide with selecors
[04:38:16] <crab> oh, ok
[04:38:24] <Cork> its just a simple rule that reduces problems :)
[04:39:04] <Cork> crab: an example is ex. input[name="accounts[]"]
[04:42:55] <JimmyB> Hello
[04:44:34] <JimmyB> I need a little push into the right direction. I am developing (just for fun) some HTA-Applications using jquery 1.4.2 and now want to update to 1.7.1 ... But I am struggeling with the ajax .get() - function that seems not to work anymore (I want to load some files from a local drive)
[04:45:06] <Wiggin> loading locally with .get?
[04:45:12] <JimmyB> so what magic word I have to google for?
[04:45:19] <JimmyB> Wiggin: jes
[04:45:21] <JimmyB> yes
[04:45:54] <JimmyB> I read that for some security reason it does not work anymore. Is there a way to enable it again?
[04:48:06] <Wiggin> are you using chrome?
[04:48:46] <JimmyB> Wiggin: no, I am using IE
[04:48:59] <JimmyB> IE 8
[04:49:24] <donCams> i wonder... how do I convert serialize array to a better format? instead of {name: theName, val: theVal} to {theName: theVal}
[04:49:41] <Wiggin> JimmyB: specifying the data type for the request, if you haven't
[04:49:46] <Wiggin> *try
[04:50:20] <Wiggin> JimmyB got it from here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/436670/local-html-file-ajax-call-and-jquery-woes
[04:50:31] <dean[w]> I have this selector: $(".post", elem).html() <-- but I wish to get all the html inside of .post *except* for the p.signature element. How can I do this?
[04:52:27] <Milos> Can we trigger within a bind?
[04:52:34] <soee> hi, aby ideas why .submit() on form doesnt work under opera when called on href click?
[04:53:23] <Milos> yeah we can nvm thanks
[04:53:29] <eugenmayer> is there a shortcut to calculate which nth child a .e.g td is ( in a tr? ) when having the context of the tr?
[04:53:44] <Wiggin> dean[w]: you could try getting the html in a string first, then remove <p class="signature">...</p> manually
[04:53:52] <dr0id> ?index
[04:53:53] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[04:54:07] <dean[w]> that would be fine Wiggin , i already have it in the string because of the .html() function usage.
[04:54:19] <dean[w]> But which jQuery function will achieve this. I think remove works on the dom, not raw html
[04:55:13] <Wiggin> well the bad programming method would be to do split twice (once on "<p class='signature'>" and once on "</p>") and join them together
[04:55:25] <Cork> eugenmayer: no, dom isn't optimized for that, and is normally a bad idea
[04:58:15] <Wiggin> dean[w]: alternatively, try putting it into a hidden div, remove all instances of p.signature within the div, get the html of that div, then clearing it
[05:00:19] <dean[w]> Wiggin, ew :D
[05:00:42] <dr0id> .tell digitalfiz cool connection bro
[05:00:47] <dr0id> ?tell digitalfiz cool connection bro
[05:00:47] <bot-t> dr0id, Okay.
[05:00:49] <Wiggin> haha
[05:01:12] <dr0id> bot-t: you failed
[05:01:13] <bot-t> dr0id, Is that a question?
[05:01:25] <minna> Hello
[05:01:27] <dr0id> ofcourse
[05:01:32] <Cork> dr0id: it doens't say anything until the user comments in the channel
[05:01:44] <minna> is there any way to disable an onchange or onclick even with jquery?
[05:01:54] <dr0id> then it didn't fail
[05:02:20] <Wiggin> ?unbind
[05:02:21] <bot-t> .unbind([eventType], [handler]): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[05:02:29] <Cork> minna: or set a value on the element and check it with and if case
[05:02:34] <minna> Even if it's not created by jquery?

[05:02:55] <Cork> minna: you mean an onclick event?
[05:02:59] <Cork> <_<
[05:03:06] <minna> Cork: yes
[05:03:08] <Wiggin> disable?
[05:03:10] <Cork> ouch
[05:03:15] <minna> Cork: It's created by the CMS.
[05:03:22] <Wiggin> ...you mean with the intention of reenabling?
[05:03:23] <fris> minna could removeattr onclick
[05:03:28] <Cork> onclick sucks, for just that reason
[05:03:53] <fris> $('.foo').removeAttr('onclick').click(function(){ });
[05:04:19] <minna> Removing it is a good suggestion, if it wasn't for the fact that all the elements are buttons with the same class.
[05:04:35] <minna> I tried using an each, for all of them, but doing that for 1000 rows is too heavy...
[05:04:43] <Cork> minna: fix your cms? -_-'
[05:04:48] <Wiggin> yeah
[05:04:54] <Cork> j/k
[05:04:57] <minna> I though of removing it using mousedown event, but that does not work for mobiles...
[05:05:02] <Cork> but ya, that sucks
[05:05:18] <minna> Sucks, yes...
[05:05:30] <minna> they say they can't remove the onclick or onchange, it's just "how the cms works"
[05:05:32] <Wiggin> your CMS might have an option for it, actually
[05:05:35] <Wiggin> go check
[05:05:46] <Wiggin> what does it do, anyway
[05:06:17] <minna> it's called businesscatalyst, im helping a friend
[05:06:26] <reddobowen> https://gist.github.com/96f2b23a82729f7b419d - Could anyone explain to me why the fadeOut isn't working in the javascript in that gist? :/
[05:07:16] <Wiggin> minna: would it happen to be this? http://www.businesscatalyst.com/ForumRetrieve.aspx?ForumID=30&TopicID=15544&NoTemplate=False
[05:07:22] <Wiggin> lightboxes
[05:08:08] <minna> Wiggin: No, the lightbox i have control over, this is for a cart
[05:08:34] <minna> for free photos, so there can be very many rows
[05:09:20] <Wiggin> reddobowen: you should be using the callback for SlideUp to fadeout #sendMsg
[05:11:02] <Wiggin> what does it do now and what are you trying to do?
[05:11:10] <Wiggin> (minna)
[05:11:51] <minna> Wiggin: If i press the remove a href link button to remove a row,  the whole page re-freshes using ajax.
[05:12:05] <minna> Wiggin: that destroys all other scripting on that page, all binds, all events....
[05:12:15] <Wiggin> ah
[05:13:47] <soee> any idea whi under Opera i cant bind click() to anchor ?
[05:15:27] <IvanKuzev> wats the href?
[05:15:58] <reddobowen> Wiggin, did you mean like this? https://gist.github.com/96f2b23a82729f7b419d
[05:16:03] <Wiggin> minna: have you tried preventDefault?
[05:16:18] <minna> Wiggin: Yes, does not seem to work for onclick.... :-(
[05:16:41] <Wiggin> then you could try editing the server-side code that generates it, otherwise you're pretty much stuck with .each .attr
[05:16:47] <Wiggin> :C
[05:17:00] <Wiggin> reddobowen: it still doesn't work?
[05:17:04] <reddobowen> Noep
[05:17:05] <reddobowen> Nope*
[05:17:16] <minna> Wiggin: I thought i was stuck, just wanted to get a second opinion.. Thanks :-)
[05:17:48] <Wiggin> reddobowen: so the animation just doesn't work?
[05:17:50] <reddobowen> Yet, if I replaced it with the line above which is commented out, that span would get replaced with the html
[05:17:51] <minna> Wiggin: I'll just have to do with using both hover and mousedown, seem to work for atleast android and iphone :)
[05:17:54] <reddobowen> it seems to be so
[05:18:07] <Wiggin> minna: well good luck with that! :)
[05:18:37] <Wiggin> hmm
[05:18:51] <dr0id> hi, im making a jquery clone
[05:18:52] <Wiggin> reddobowen: try using animate({opacity:'toggle'})
[05:18:59] <reddobowen> okay
[05:19:34] <minna> Wiggin: do you know if i can have multiple event handles when using live?
[05:19:40] <reddobowen> That worked wig gin :)
[05:19:42] <reddobowen> wiggin*
[05:19:56] <minna> Wiggin: .live('click,change', like that?
[05:20:36] <CoolCoder> how to make checkbox readonly. "$("#is_fax").attr('readonly',true);"  not working
[05:20:52] <Wiggin> minna: .live("click change",
[05:20:57] <Wiggin> space-separated
[05:21:19] <Wiggin> reddobowen: np : )
[05:21:49] <NotStooge> On mouseenter an div i open a tooltip and on mouseleave i close it, but my tooltip is showing up under my mouse and its calling mouseleave every time it shows up how to stop that?
[05:22:18] <minna> Wiggin: Ok, or should i use delegate?
[05:22:45] <Wiggin> CoolCoder: you have to use the disabled property
[05:22:50] <Wiggin> CoolCoder: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/155291/can-html-checkboxes-be-set-to-readonly
[05:23:04] <CoolCoder> Wiggin: is not getting the value while making disabled
[05:23:19] <CoolCoder> while form is submited, its not getting the checked state
[05:24:23] <Wiggin> CoolCoder: yeah the page doesn't submit disabled boxes
[05:24:39] <Wiggin> CoolCoder: you could bind a handler to the submit event that reenables them before submission
[05:24:57] <CoolCoder> k. let me try
[05:25:19] <Wiggin> minna: I'm not sure but delegate seems to improve performance which is pretty important in your case
[05:25:33] <IvanKuzev> NotStooge probably something related to tooltip plugin....anyway cant help without a preview
[05:26:23] <reddobowen> Sorry wiggin, one last thing; I want to fade out the current text, replace it and then fade back in.. https://gist.github.com/96f2b23a82729f7b419d - What this currently does is fade out, text appears and then fades out again, any ideas? I tried adding .animate({opacity:'toggle'}) to the end of the replaceWith block, but that didn't work :(
[05:26:58] <minna> Wiggin: I'll try delegate then :-) Thanks for the help!
[05:27:11] <cambazz> hello, i am using blockUI for a while.
[05:27:15] <Wiggin> reddobowen: it didn't work, as in it didn't hide the span?
[05:27:21] <cambazz> how can I know when blockUI is blocked
[05:27:40] <reddobowen> It hides the span just fine on first time :) then it replaces the information but hides the new information, rather than fading that new information in
[05:27:50] <cambazz> i.e. i have some complicated settings where i need to block and then reblock, etc, and i have to check the state of whether it is blocked or not?
[05:28:20] <Wiggin> reddobowen: then you have to hide it instantly when you change it
[05:28:29] <reddobowen> ah okay.
[05:28:44] <Wiggin> reddobowen: keep it as it is, but add .animate({opacity:'toggle'},0) to the end of the replaceWith
[05:29:38] <reddobowen> It still faded :(
[05:30:04] <Wiggin> huh
[05:30:22] <Wiggin> okay change that animate to .hide()
[05:30:39] <reddobowen> tried that too.. that also failed :/
[05:30:59] <Trudko> guys jquery cannot find element with ID sar_4a_tin_unknown_check_1 but  $(document.getElementById("sar_4a_tin_unknown_check_1")).size() returns 1 so item is there
[05:31:21] <Wiggin> huh weird
[05:31:42] <Wiggin> cambazz: what happens if you call it twice?
[05:31:47] <dassouki> what is a good ribbon plugin/system
[05:32:00] <Wiggin> and reddobowen try removing all but the first animates
[05:33:26] <Wiggin> and guys I need a break >< back in five
[05:34:14] <Trudko> btw html of  element is  <input name="sar_4a_TIN_unknown_check_1" id="sar_4a_TIN_unknown_check_1" type="checkbox" CHECKED="checked" value="true"/>
[05:36:12] <IvanKuzev> jquery may be case sensitive
[05:36:33] <IvanKuzev> and use .length not size()..
[05:36:52] <Trudko> IvanKuzev: ok thats it
[05:36:58] <Trudko> why? they are same aren't they?
[05:37:37] <erichynds> what selector are you passing into jquery
[05:38:14] <Wiggin> uh
[05:38:15] <Wiggin> back
[05:38:21] <IvanKuzev> Trudko:The .size() method is functionally equivalent to the .length property; however, the .length property is preferred because it does not have the overhead of a function call.
[05:42:31] <Trudko> ok thx
[05:47:13] <Wiggin> reddobowen: is your problem fixed? :)
[05:48:23] <reddobowen> Yeah, thanks wig gin - I did a quick google search and found what i was after :)
[05:48:25] <reddobowen> wiggin*
[05:48:37] <Wiggin> ah kay
[05:49:32] <Myx0x3> why does this not work? http://pastebin.com/LmYqGsCk
[05:49:59] <Xotix> Does someone use datatables in here?
[05:50:53] <Wiggin> Myx0x3: what doesn't work?
[05:51:13] <Myx0x3> Wiggin: the "content" does not get the specified "code"
[05:51:34] <Myx0x3> Wiggin: i want it to apply calltex-data, it just say "undefied"
[05:51:40] <Myx0x3> and its not :P
[05:51:51] <Wiggin> but it shows up, yes?
[05:51:56] <Wiggin> the tooltip
[05:51:58] <Wiggin> it appears
[05:52:52] <Myx0x3> Wiggin: yes
[05:53:13] <Myx0x3> Wiggin: ive wrote wrong in the example, it should be data-calltext ofcs
[05:53:29] <Wiggin> ?
[05:53:34] <Myx0x3> last row
[05:53:37] <Servercrash> how to select all the form elements in a given form and iterate over them
[05:53:39] <Wiggin> oh
[05:54:01] <Myx0x3> thats whats inside the html code ofcs* execpt data-calltext and data-calltitle
[05:54:09] <Servercrash> currently i am doing $('#myform input').each(function(){});
[05:54:53] <Myx0x3> Wiggin: its the line 5 that does not work
[05:55:02] <Wiggin> yeah I'm figuring out why
[05:55:08] <Wiggin> um
[05:55:21] <Wiggin> try putting it in a function and returning that segment of code
[05:55:41] <Wiggin> replace it with function(){return '<b>'+$(".dropdown").data("calltitle")+'</b><br/>'+$(".dropdown").data("calltext");},
[05:55:51] <Wiggin> and check for errors in your console
[05:56:09] <Myx0x3> 1sec
[05:57:59] <Myx0x3> Wiggin: got no errors, but it still returned undefiend, im checking Firefox debugg, 1 more sec
[05:58:54] <Myx0x3> Wiggin: cant find any errors..
[05:58:57] <Wiggin> uh
[05:59:35] <IvanKuzev> here is an idea...may help debuging...try to set the content to variable...and then set the variable to the plugin
[05:59:59] <Myx0x3> Wiggin: and it show first undefiend bold, and the other on a new line, so it has problem to get the numbers, hehe
[06:00:03] <IvanKuzev> maybe put a 'debugger;' between them too
[06:01:57] <Wiggin> is dropdown a single-element class?
[06:02:20] <Myx0x3> Wiggin: well, its looped out, but the data is still the same
[06:02:40] <Myx0x3> but i want to be able to change the data thrue our admin
[06:02:43] <Wiggin> so having alert($(".dropdown").data... returns something, right?
[06:03:11] <Wiggin> IvanKuzev: problem is that it's multiple elements
[06:03:12] <Myx0x3> Wiggin: nope, "undefined"
[06:03:17] <Wiggin> yeah
[06:03:39] <Wiggin> you have to set it differently for each .dropdown element
[06:03:56] <Wiggin> and then use .each and $(this)
[06:04:21] <Wiggin> asdf why do people keep joining and leaving it really is quite annoying
[06:04:36] <Myx0x3> $(this).each.data("calltext") ? or am i getting it wrong?
[06:04:43] <Wiggin> umm
[06:04:52] <Wiggin> you have to change quite a bit
[06:04:56] <IvanKuzev> Wiggin:cant you configure your irc client to not show these messages.the joins and quite
[06:05:01] <Myx0x3> oh..
[06:05:03] <Wiggin> I could
[06:05:13] <Wiggin> but I want it in my other rooms :P
[06:05:13] <asdf`> thats not my fault, Wiggin :(
[06:05:19] <Wiggin> oops hehe
[06:05:38] <Wiggin> Hang on Myx0x3 I'll edit the pastebin
[06:05:45] <Wiggin> sorry asdf go back to idling
[06:06:13] <Myx0x3> Wiggin: okay thanks! im pretty new at Jquery, realy frustrating doing this in the end of the day, haha..
[06:06:28] <IvanKuzev> Myx0x3 : $(".dropdown").each(function(){
[06:06:40] <X99> each.data ...
[06:07:17] <X99> do you want to set the dom' innerHTML value or the form element's value?
[06:07:31] <Myx0x3> me?
[06:07:33] <IvanKuzev> ouch..wait a minute for a fiddle
[06:07:49] * Myx0x3 is confused
[06:07:56] <rotozip> I have a bunch of dynamically created text boxes that I want to get an array of values for.  They all have the class name of daysToComplete.  Here is what I have so far var daysToComplete = $('daysToComplete:input[type=text]').get().  How far off am I from getting the value?
[06:08:13] <X99> $(this).attr(attributeName, attributeValue);
[06:08:54] <X99> or $(className).each(function() { $(this).attr(xxx, xxx););
[06:08:55] <IvanKuzev> Myx0x3: here is edited with this

[06:10:51] <Myx0x3> IvanKuzev and Wiggin wow, thanks, you saved my afternoon :)
[06:11:23] <Wiggin> good luck on learning jquery
[06:11:30] <Wiggin> it gets easier :D
[06:11:46] <Myx0x3> Thanks, ive not had a good start, haha.. but im learning! still im noobish sometimes, hehe
[06:11:58] <Myx0x3> like the last thing now..
[06:12:07] <X99> you had to download a least api chm of the jquery :D
[06:12:27] <NotStooge> On mouseenter an div i open a tooltip and on mouseleave i close it, but my tooltip is showing up under my mouse and its calling mouseleave every time it shows up how to stop that?
[06:12:40] <IvanKuzev> X99 : btw is there such a thing?
[06:13:01] <IvanKuzev> NotStooge : example needed
[06:13:13] <NotStooge> ok
[06:13:32] <X99> IvanKuzev:just google it :D
[06:15:06] <IvanKuzev> yeah updated god knows when
[06:16:12] <X99> IvanKuze:http://docs.jquery.com/Alternative_Resources
[06:16:31] <Wiggin> haha chm
[06:16:41] <Wiggin> the html docs work fine, thank you very much
[06:16:42] <X99> try this url
[06:16:59] <anjen> good morning. I'm having a small issue using slideToggle. Hope someoen might have a lead. basically, it's sticking, (not fluid motion) while opening. I recall reading about a cause a while back, but I can't quite get there again....I am using a combo of divs and tables if that helps to narrow down an "aha" cause
[06:17:28] <Wiggin> ah a person in need
[06:17:34] <Wiggin> to the #jquerymobile
[06:18:45] <Wiggin> anjen post it onto jsfiddle
[06:18:50] <appono> How would one go about adding a whole style block via jquery? I need to add a selector/block of rules.
[06:19:00] <Wiggin> style block?
[06:19:02] <Wiggin> just use .css
[06:19:04] <Wiggin> ?css
[06:19:04] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[06:19:16] <Wiggin> (also set style properties)
[06:19:19] <appono> Wiggin: I need to create the selector
[06:19:23] <NotStooge> http://jsfiddle.net/HrMDS/ meh i can't make it run in jfiddle :/
[06:19:41] <Wiggin> ?
[06:19:45] <Wiggin> create the selector?
[06:19:58] <appono> Yeah. I need to define a new selector.
[06:20:07] <Wiggin> NotStooge: hnnnggg what is this code
[06:20:29] <Wiggin> appono: so...what's the problem with that?
[06:20:37] <Wiggin> sorry I'm not really getting the problem
[06:20:45] <Wiggin> you mean you need to add a class to some elements or something?
[06:21:11] <NotStooge> my function ^^
[06:21:22] <NotStooge> i am using live because on isn't working..
[06:21:36] <appono> Wiggin: Nope. I mean I need to add a vendor specific pseudo-element selector and some rules.
[06:22:11] <appono> I'll give an example. sec
[06:22:27] <Wiggin> meanwhile
[06:22:38] <appono> :-webkit-full-screen #myvideo {  ... bla bla ... } <-- need to add that
[06:22:42] <Wiggin> NotStooge: is this a resolved problem because I have no idea what's wrong
[06:22:54] <Wiggin> ah
[06:22:56] <NotStooge> yeah it is
[06:23:02] <Wiggin> okay
[06:23:13] <NotStooge> i am just trying to make the tooltip not hide if the mouse is over it
[06:23:39] <NotStooge> because my tooltip is dynamic sometimes it comes under the mouse
[06:23:46] <NotStooge> and hides itself
[06:23:59] <Wiggin> appono: for browser-specific hacks there are jquery functions/plugins for that
[06:24:03] <NotStooge> i forgot to add it in the jsfiddle ^^
[06:24:08] <Wiggin> or rather browser selectors
[06:24:22] <Wiggin> and then you can just use $("#myvideo").css(....
[06:24:46] <appono> Wiggin: Not really a hack. I mean, the DOM spec provides a way to access and manipulate the raw stylesheet text.
[06:24:51] <helllen> helllo
[06:24:55] <NotStooge> yoo
[06:25:04] <Wiggin> hi
[06:25:04] <appono> It's something like document.styleSheets[i].rules[i]
[06:25:07] <NotStooge> there is a lady in the room :O
[06:25:15] <Wiggin> I'm talking about your -webkit-full-screen
[06:25:18] <IvanKuzev> NotStooge:why not make the tooltip hide on mouseleave of the tooltip and the div that spawned it
[06:25:19] <Wiggin> so it's not about that?
[06:25:26] <helllen> I am using treeTable and I am using appendBranchTo to add a node inside other node with javascript (drag and drop)
[06:25:44] <helllen> someone has tried to add this node directly to the root node ?
[06:25:50] * Wiggin inserts obligatory no-girls-on-the-internet comment
[06:25:51] <helllen> the root node is not presented
[06:25:55] <appono> It is. But the problem relates to jquery not providing access to the styleSheets object I guess
[06:26:15] <Wiggin> appono: yeah because generally you don't need it
[06:26:18] <NotStooge> how to make the tooltip hide by 2 conditions?
[06:26:29] <Wiggin> appono: is there anything you can't accomplish with .css?
[06:27:05] <appono> can't add that pseudo-element selector. ^^
[06:27:25] <Wiggin> buh
[06:27:30] <Wiggin> -webkit-full-screen?
[06:27:56] <IvanKuzev> NotStooge: you check in the first condition for the second
[06:28:04] <IvanKuzev> it this case
[06:28:11] <soee> any idea why click() doesnt work under Opera ?
[06:28:25] <IvanKuzev> check in the $('tooltip').mouseleave()
[06:28:51] <IvanKuzev> for ($(trigerer).is(':hover'))
[06:29:20] <Wiggin> appono: webkit-full-screen might be in the mobile API
[06:29:43] <appono> Wiggin: Found a solution. Just $("head").append("<style>...</style>") works
[06:29:55] <Wiggin> oh that's what you wanted to do?
[06:29:56] <appono> erm
[06:29:57] <Wiggin> -^
[06:30:05] <Wiggin> okay whatever works for you
[06:30:10] <appono> I mean $("<style>..</style>")*
[06:30:28] <Pllum> hello
[06:30:32] <Wiggin> and .append?
[06:30:39] <NotStooge> IvanKuzev what is a trigerer?
[06:30:58] <Wiggin> hi Pllum
[06:30:59] <Pllum> hello everyone
[06:31:04] <IvanKuzev> NotStooge: the element that spawned the tooltip?
[06:31:12] <Pllum> i am using lazyloader
[06:31:13] <NotStooge> thought so ok thanks
[06:31:31] <Pllum> and i want when image is loaded to remove the loading image background from its container
[06:31:54] <Pllum> is there a way to do this without modifying anything on lazyloader script
[06:33:29] <Wiggin> soee: can you be more specific with your problem?
[06:34:10] <NotStooge> formion?
[06:34:13] <Wiggin> helllen: what exactly was your problem?
[06:36:10] <appono> Wiggin: and append yeah.
[06:36:11] <Wiggin> Pllum: I believe the loading image is no longer there once an image is loaded
[06:36:18] <appono> Thanks for the help
[06:37:27] <Wiggin> Yeah Pllum if you inspect the loaded and unloaded elements, the loaded elements just have their src replaced with the actual images, so the background image isn't there anymore
[06:38:42] <soee> Wiggin: i have form, and i want to submit it not using submit button but some normal link (<a ..>...) under FF all works fine but under Opera im all the time on the same page - im not redirected anywhere
[06:39:18] <Pllum> but the problem is that i have something like this    <div class="container"><img class="lazy" src="transparent.gif" data-original="path/to/image.jpg"></div>    and i have the loading image set to container
[06:39:24] <Wiggin> soee: so you've tried using alert on the click handler and it doesn't run?
[06:39:38] <helllen> <Wiggin> I have a tree Table and I use appendBranchTo method
[06:39:46] <soee> Wiggin: it runs with FF but not Opera
[06:39:54] <helllen> to add a row to other tree row
[06:40:00] <Pllum> so when img.lazy is loaded i need to remove the background image of div.container
[06:40:06] <Wiggin> why you all reply at the same time
[06:40:18] <Wiggin> IvanKuzev: a little help?
[06:40:21] <helllen> the problem is what do I specify if I want to add it to the root node?
[06:40:29] <helllen> better?
[06:40:51] <IvanKuzev> Wiggin:what problem?
[06:40:58] <Wiggin> all of theirs
[06:41:04] <Wiggin> actually just pick one and help
[06:41:47] <appono> god I hate how browsers are stripping "javascript:" from stuff pasted in the address bar. To protect users from themselves. sigh.
[06:42:04] <IvanKuzev> Pllum: how do you try to submit?
[06:42:15] <rotozip> X99: Thanks for posting that example of getting an array of text box values for me.  I have it working now
[06:42:32] <X99> Welcome
[06:43:28] <IvanKuzev> ops....i think that last one was soee
[06:43:52] <minna> How do i select $(this) when it is a select option element im after? I tried $(this option) but that didnt work.
[06:44:12] <IvanKuzev> soee:how do you try to submit a form curently?...i say use $('form selector').submit()
[06:44:58] <soee> IvanKuzev: im trying this atm: http://pastebin.com/u8Lzu6iy
[06:45:18] <Wiggin> helllen: as far as I can tell you can't
[06:45:28] <soee> IvanKuzev: where $('.wyszukaj-na-stronie') referes to anchor
[06:45:34] <Wiggin> helllen: sorry :(
[06:45:40] <IvanKuzev> minna: $(this).children('option') if this is select
[06:45:52] <minna> IvanKuzev: Ah, thank you!
[06:47:35] <Wiggin> Pllum: which lazy load plugin are you using?
[06:47:45] <Wiggin> is it this one http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload
[06:47:46] <Pllum> sorry i was away
[06:47:50] <IvanKuzev> soee: put prevent default at the end...#tx_odsautocomplete_pi1_form is the id of the form right
[06:47:56] <Pllum> yeah that one
[06:48:21] <Wiggin> yeah you can't put callbacks, apparently
[06:48:42] <Pllum> yeah
[06:49:07] <Pllum> i tried adding .load to all images
[06:49:19] <Wiggin> !?
[06:49:43] <Pllum> and when it is loaded, to remove the background from its parent container
[06:50:10] <gregoryLwD> results of the search for the higgs bosen, live seminar from CERN: http://webcast.web.cern.ch/webcast/
[06:50:41] <Pllum> $('lazy').load( function(){ .. });
[06:50:50] <gregoryLwD> "not found it yet, not excluded it yet. Merry Christmas, etc."
[06:50:50] <Wiggin> uhh
[06:50:59] <Pllum> but it only fires the first time when transparent.gif loads
[06:51:00] <Wiggin> that's not how .load works, or what it's for
[06:51:10] <Wiggin> haha gregoryLwD
[06:51:17] <Pllum> but isnt it supposed to fire when image is loaded ?
[06:51:24] <Wiggin> noooo
[06:51:31] <Wiggin> .load is a jquery ajax function
[06:51:47] <Pllum> but .. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[06:52:05] <Wiggin> ah
[06:52:07] <Wiggin> no
[06:52:10] <Wiggin> you have to use $.load
[06:52:17] <gregoryLwD> Wiggin, the seminar started at 1pm, I tuned in at just the right moment :)
[06:52:22] <Wiggin> $(element).load is something else entirely
[06:52:36] <Wiggin> uh 1PM GMT?
[06:52:38] <Wiggin> well it's over now
[06:52:39] <Wiggin> bleh
[06:53:04] <jDog> as a noob to testing
[06:53:06] <jDog> unit testing
[06:53:12] <jDog> and jquery
[06:53:20] <Wiggin> oh wait
[06:53:26] <Wiggin> augh sorry Pllum I'm an idiot
[06:53:35] <Wiggin> yes um well
[06:53:36] <jDog> i feel i should begin my testing with jquery
[06:53:39] <jDog> unit testing
[06:53:47] <Pllum> oh nope everyone gets confused :P
[06:53:59] <Wiggin> the original image with the transparent would already be considered as loaded
[06:54:03] <jDog> what should i test my jquery with?
[06:54:35] <Wiggin> the api page says that load doesn't work well with images though
[06:55:09] <Pllum> so its better to use .ready() i think
[06:55:23] <Pllum> or not ..
[06:55:44] <Wiggin> no ready doesn't even wait for images to load
[06:55:54] <Pllum> yeah i just read that
[06:55:55] <Wiggin> it fires as soon as the DOM can be manipulated
[06:56:18] <IvanKuzev> meaning all the dext is loaded
[06:56:33] <Pllum> anyway .load() loads only the first time,  it doesnt fire the second time when lazyloader changes the src to real image path
[06:56:38] <Xotix> hi
[06:56:49] <Wiggin> yes
[06:57:10] <helllen> don't worry it is difficult to explain
[06:57:21] <helllen> I have solved in other way and it is ok
[06:57:23] <helllen> thanks a lot
[06:57:34] <Wiggin> Pllum: only way to solve it as I see it is to edit the function itself
[06:57:44] <helllen> another question is how can I know if the mouse is over one component?
[06:57:47] <Pllum> yeah i think soo
[06:57:57] <Wiggin> helllen: well I don't know too much about treetable, but the demo on the website can't put stuff in the root node either
[06:58:11] <Xotix> i got 2 fiels. Password and Confirm Password. Both are not required. I'm using Zend_Validate_Identical to check one against the other. If one of both is set, an error should appear, which says: Please set both or none.How can i do that?
[06:58:12] <IvanKuzev> helllen: try .is(':hover')
[06:58:13] <Pllum> ill just edit it
[06:58:42] <helllen> <Wiggin>, I have put the root node but I don't show it ;-)
[06:58:52] <Wiggin> buh?
[06:58:53] <helllen> so I can add nodes to the root node now :-D
[06:59:03] <Wiggin> oh
[06:59:08] <Wiggin> heh that works I suppose
[06:59:44] <aravind_> I've an ajax validation form. Doesnt .val() work on password fields anymore?
[07:00:15] <NotStooge> how to pass a function with parameter to another function?
[07:00:17] <IvanKuzev> <aravind_> : it does..last time i checked
[07:00:20] <Wiggin> .val should still work
[07:00:22] <sphinxxx> anyone know how i can modify this jquery ui autocomplete, so that i can get the source from an xml file instead of a predefined array?  http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple
[07:00:43] <Wiggin> NotStooge: what?
[07:00:59] <NotStooge> function a (param) {} function b (a) {}  b (a(param));
[07:01:02] <aravind_> I tried on all different browsers and it doesnt work. So I moved to .attr('value')
[07:01:10] <aravind_> .val() just returned Password
[07:01:25] <helllen> <IvanKuzev>, I get an error when I execute ->     $("#sensorTable").is(':hover')
[07:01:28] <Ran> Hey all, any idea how to fix jQuery UI Tabs widget from initially resizing itself to the full height of it's contents that are part of other tabs that aren't supposed to be rendered?
[07:01:52] <Wiggin> sphinxxx: you have to write your own callback function, I'm afraid
[07:03:41] <aravind_> sphinxxx maybe you could retract the source from xml and then assign it to the arry
[07:03:43] <aravind_> array*
[07:04:23] <sphinxxx> aravind_, thats what i was thinking
[07:04:47] <IvanKuzev> <helllen> is() returns boolean...be aware
[07:05:36] <JillesCode> hey guys, how do you catch keypresses again on jQuery? I want to alert 'Secret!' when someone types: secret
[07:05:46] <aravind_> This is my password confirmation check. Could anybody check why it doesnt work. It stops at the loader.gif
[07:05:47] <aravind_> http://pastebin.com/GkdYstb0
[07:08:09] <sphinxxx> aravind_, i think $(this) instead of (this)
[07:08:17] <sphinxxx> on the 4th line
[07:09:08] <aravind_> Ty :)
[07:09:17] <IvanKuzev> ?is
[07:09:17] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[07:10:35] <AdvoWork> how would I check if a element with a certain class exists?
[07:10:37] <sphinxxx> if you're calling this, just do something like $this = $(this); and then just refer to $this
[07:12:04] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork:  if its in the dom $('.certanclass').length >0
[07:12:37] <JillesCode> Guys I want to alert something if someone types alert, but not in an input box, just alert onkeydown("alert") (somethnig like that)
[07:13:14] <NotStooge> executeOnLoad(resizeSomething(5px), scrollerId); executeOnLoad takes 2 parameters only one of them is a function. how to make it possible to take a function with parameter in it?
[07:13:42] <crichards> JillesCode: you'll need a way to keep track of keypresses, then if they typed the whole thing show the alert
[07:13:53] <poni> Is there a way to make a variable of HTML code into a jquery object? I want to use .find on it, to remove all excess HTML I retrieved from using .get and only spare one element. I was gonna use .load instead, but I couldn't store it to a variable then
[07:14:07] <JillesCode> crichards,  I figured, but how?
[07:14:11] <crichards> poni: $(html)
[07:14:21] <poni> Oh okay, thanks
[07:14:36] <poni> JillesCode: What is it you want to do? Show something after a code has been pressed? I have such a function right here
[07:14:40] <poni> I can pastebin it to you
[07:14:40] <IvanKuzev> NotStooge: this may be tricky one ...wrap it up in an empty function like function(){resizeSomething(5px)  }
[07:14:52] <crichards> JillesCode: if you don't have an input, then you need to bind to the document keyup, and store the keypresses in an array or string or soemthing
[07:15:10] <JillesCode> poni, yes something like that! just alert something when someone types: alert
[07:15:15] <poni> Ah
[07:15:17] <Pllum> wiggin and ivankuzev  my problem is solver thanks ;)
[07:15:27] <Wiggin> :D
[07:15:29] <poni> Let me find my template index, just a sec
[07:15:35] <sphinxxx> if data is a map, how do i loop through it with .each ?
[07:15:51] <Pllum> and with this the website is complete now  : http://molosgroup.com/webnew/#  :(
[07:15:52] <Pllum> :)

[07:22:20] <logicrises> ie7 reflow sucks!
[07:31:02] <Pllum> logicrises : what is that ?
[07:31:30] <logicrises> Pllum, what is reflow?
[07:31:34] <Pllum> yeah
[07:34:33] <logicrises> In my case I have an animation using jquery. IE7 thinks that it doesn't need to repaint some elements that I am animating, so in tern they dont get repositioned where they should.
[07:35:26] <AdvoWork> How is this even possible, i've got: <select name="stocking_uom" id="uom_types" class="uom_types"></select> AND <select name="purchasing_uom" id="uom_types" class="uom_types"></select> and im doing $('select[name="stocking_uom"]').val("TEST");  but its adding that to both of them..
[07:37:24] <Genesis2001> AdvoWork: Tried unique id's?
[07:37:47] <Pllum> yeah that could be a problem, as they are supposed to be unique
[07:38:10] <Pllum> i had some weird problems, because i was using id on few elements
[07:38:17] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork:this shoud not be right....but relly try not to dublicate the ids
[07:38:17] <joshsmith> if anyone's worked with Bootstraps modals, I'm looking for a way to bind the data to the modal using AJAX or something
[07:39:12] <logicrises> joshsmith, what system are you using?
[07:39:50] <Genesis2001> yea, AdvoWork, use unique id's and if you need to style the <select> tag, use a class for that
[07:40:21] <joshsmith> logicrises: currently? I've been putting the HTML within the page that the modal is on
[07:40:41] <joshsmith> but that's bad practice for a number of reasons
[07:42:48] <logicrises> joshsmith, Ive never used modal I use colorbox
[07:42:52] <logicrises> its great
[07:43:07] <logicrises> it can handle ajax
[07:43:11] <logicrises> and iframes
[07:44:07] <Wiggin> oops afk
[07:44:13] <Wiggin> okay I'll be going now, bye guyd
[07:44:28] <Wiggin> goodnight, if you're anywhere near the GMT+8 timezone :P
[07:45:10] <Gijs> When manipulating the contents of a <style> tag with $(...).html() and $(...).text(), jQuery seems to treat it like any other element. This means changes don't get reflected in IE (you need to use .styleSheet.cssText on it for that to work). Would filing an enhancement request (and possibly patching it) be any use or would people feel that's not up to jQuery to workaround?
[07:45:39] <helllen> helllo
[07:45:59] <Gijs> (I'm happy to just file in bugs.jquery.com if that's the best approach, but I figured I'd ask before - I tried searching, that didn't seem to turn up anything related)
[07:46:26] <helllen> I have a structure like this:     <div id="x">   <div id="y"></div>   </div>
[07:46:50] <helllen> how could I drop an element to divX but not on divY
[07:46:51] <helllen> ?
[07:47:10] <IvanKuzev> reattach the divy elsewhere
[07:47:16] <asterisk-Tester> Hello, is there an yeasy way in jquery to set the selecteditem of a select by using a value / string (knowing all options had unique values) ?
[07:47:39] <tobb1> $("y").insertBefore()
[07:47:43] <IvanKuzev> helllen:you wanted to remove divx right?
[07:47:48] <Gijs> asterisk-Tester: $('select').val('someVal')
[07:48:04] <Gijs> (where 'someVal' equals the value attribute of the option you want)
[07:49:01] <tobb1> eehm.. $("<html stuff>").insertBefore("#y")
[07:49:17] <IvanKuzev> helllen:if you wanted to instert in div x...then use$("#X").prepend() ,,or append
[07:50:00] <IvanKuzev>  helllen:prepend inserts in the begining append in the end
[07:50:29] <Morkel> how can i find the CSS selector from a link?
[07:51:04] <IvanKuzev> Morkel: any element can be selected using multiple ways
[07:51:50] <Morkel> IvanKuzev: But what does it mean when this "You can use a CSS selector or find a link by its text contents " in a doc?
[07:51:59] <IvanKuzev> Morkel: you can use class. and select it by class you can select it by id,or by some attribute...or even by relationship to parrent elements
[07:52:13] <Morkel> ok
[07:52:24] <Morkel> thx
[07:53:14] <IvanKuzev> Morkel it all depends on your html and what you want to acomplish
[07:53:25] <asterisk-Tester> Gijs: Thx, but it didnt work... I tried with 'select' defined as name and id
[07:58:25] <rmaceissoft> hi all, what jquery templating library do you recommend to me? is icanhazjs a good option?.
[07:58:51] <Gijs> asterisk-Tester: check you're getting the select element alright? ( $('yourselector').length >= 1 )
[07:59:11] <Gijs> asterisk-Tester: if the selector doesn't work, the value assignment obviously won't work either.
[08:00:10] * IvanKuzev eats fiddles give him some
[08:00:31] <Gijs> asterisk-Tester: see http://jsfiddle.net/GtSn9/ for a working example.
[08:02:37] <IvanKuzev> mnomn nomn nomn
[08:02:53] <asterisk-Tester> Gijs: thx for the sample code, and ur right, its returning 0 from the selector...
[08:04:34] <asterisk-Tester> Gijs: it worked, mixed the id and the name of the select
[08:04:37] <asterisk-Tester> thx :-)
[08:07:22] <rmaceissoft> hi all again, I'm looking for a jquery templating library. I found icanhazjs, but I just read about jsView+jsRender, what do you recomend to me?
[08:08:16] <rmaceissoft> are jsview+jsrender in a stable state?
[08:11:43] <andrew9183> have you guys ever written a huge chunk of code and have it work the first time
[08:12:50] <IvanKuzev> andrew9183:not really...aways have to debug something if its more than 1 screen long
[08:14:54] <Milos> if I have $('.someclass').mouseover(function() { some stuff; });
[08:14:57] <Milos> and then I add an element
[08:14:59] <Milos> with .someclass
[08:15:09] <Milos> does that apply to it too, or only on previously-existing elements?
[08:15:29] <IvanKuzev> <Milos>only on previously-existing elements
[08:15:39] <Milos> IvanKuzev, ah
[08:16:10] <IvanKuzev> there is such a thing as live events for a case of a new element...but i dont know about them,yet
[08:16:26] <Milos> ok
[08:16:44] <Milos> it's just that
[08:16:54] <Milos> I create a div, then make it draggable by doing 'onmouseover': "$(this).draggable({handle: '.titlebar', stack: '.track', distance: 0, scroll: false})"
[08:16:56] <Milos> as an attribute
[08:17:02] <Milos> it just seems weird using it in a string like that
[08:17:04] <Milos> is there a better way?
[08:18:59] <IvanKuzev> maybe wrap it up in a function()
[08:19:40] <Milos> IvanKuzev, but if I do onmouseover: function() { ... how do I refernce the object itself, I can't use `this' then can I
[08:19:48] <Milos> because it's not in a string so it will be evaluated immediately
[08:22:37] <IvanKuzev> dunno... about the this you can run it in debugger and see what is this
[08:22:57] <IvanKuzev> or even if its not what you need you can set it with ?proxy
[08:23:02] <IvanKuzev> ?.proxy
[08:23:02] <bot-t> jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[08:23:51] <Milos> thanks
[08:30:06] <AdvoWork> if im doing  var selected = $("#"+type.id+" option:selected"); how can i do that for a name instead? ie if im using name="" instead of id="" ?
[08:30:20] <Littulb> question: Does anyone know how to detect (listen for) a change in an elements style (display, position, border type, etc.)????
[08:33:27] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork: $("#"+type.id+" change it with $("select[name='yourname']"
[08:34:07] <IvanKuzev> AdvoWork: if its drop down
[08:34:23] <IvanKuzev> if its checkbox use
[08:34:31] <IvanKuzev> $("input[name='yourname']"
[08:34:48] <VictorCL> how can I select all  <li> which doestn have a class name "tit"
[08:35:09] <IvanKuzev> VictorCL: $('li:not(.tit)')
[08:35:24] <VictorCL> great , thankz
[08:35:25] <Mkop> is there an easy way to sort optgroups in a select?
[08:35:32] <kenthree> and .not('.tit')
[08:35:53] <Mkop> .not is generally preferred over :not
[08:36:42] <VictorCL> $(".main-menu li").not(".tit").click(....     like that ?
[08:37:02] <Mkop> yes
[08:37:40] <AdvoWork> IvanKuzev, thanks for the help
[08:37:48] <IvanKuzev> VictorCL:yeah will work too.
[08:38:42] <Littulb> question: Does anyone know how to detect (listen for) a change in an elements style (display, position, border type, etc.)????
[08:40:26] <IvanKuzev> now taht would be a nice debugging addition to my toolset
[08:42:25] <aljosa> i'm looking for list of all event types, expected it here http://api.jquery.com/event.type/ where can i find it in docs?
[08:42:34] <lecoeur> I have a text that represents html page. How can I convert this text to dom object? Just $(text)  ??
[08:42:59] <IvanKuzev> $(text) shoud work
[08:43:17] <lecoeur> hm, but if I do $(text).html() I receive null
[08:43:20] <IvanKuzev> also you can add it to an element via ?.html
[08:43:47] <IvanKuzev> try $(text).length to check for elements
[08:44:16] <IvanKuzev> ?html
[08:44:16] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[08:45:01] <IvanKuzev> so....html()this returning null may be normal if you have line like <p></p><div>anithing<div>
[08:45:01] <lecoeur> ah, ok)
[08:45:02] <lecoeur> thanks)
[08:46:25] <Kingsy> hey guys, basically I am starting a personal website and was looking for a neat little jquery "gimmick" to have as a site background.. anyone aware of something I could use? as an example I saw a site that printed shapes and patterns depending on where you dragged the mouse.. I don't know really what I am looking for.. I guess some ideas? or plugin examples?
[08:47:54] <JAAulde> When selecting elements, I know that `input.foo` is faster than `.foo`, esp in IE. But what about when using `.is()`? It almost seems like it would be the reverse since there is less parsing to do of the selector and fewer checks to make against the element in question. Am I correct about this?
[08:48:05] <devc> Hey guys, an overall JS question -- I'm creating an object of application data but can't figure out how to structure it. It's an object of American states, ('pa', 'ny', 'fl', etc) then inside I have two objects which are populated with arrays. Here's a small demo http://jsfiddle.net/gk7Ka/
[08:48:10] <Kingsy> heh I don't know even what I am searching for on google, I guess I am looking for something "fun" ?
[08:48:29] <lecoeur> hm, however, my dom object looks strange: http://cl.ly/3c3U0q0Z1F240r0F0104
[08:48:53] <devc> I want to get rid of the 0: before the x,y values, instead just using [950, 485] instead of { 'x': 950, 'y': 485 }
[08:49:15] <Mkop> lecoeur: what's in all those text nodes?
[08:49:18] <devc> But I dunno how to rite that without getting JS errors.
[08:49:33] <andrew9183> what does $(window) refer to specifically ?
[08:49:38] <andrew9183> browser window ?
[08:49:54] <lecoeur> answerHtml is just html page as text
[08:50:28] <IvanKuzev> $(window).the render area in browser window
[08:50:57] <lecoeur> Mkop: these text nodes are part of my html page
[08:51:13] <Mkop> devc: then what's the problem?
[08:51:45] <Mkop> I mean lecoeur
[08:52:12] <Kingsy> ah nm found some cool stuff
[08:52:42] <lecoeur> it doesnot looks like normal dom object, i'm triyng to create dom object from text by doing : $(text)
[08:52:51] <Mkop> looks fine to me
[08:53:08] <IvanKuzev> lecoeur:have any success?\
[08:53:36] <IvanKuzev> lecoeur:after you make it with $(text) you shoud append it to something
[08:53:37] <lecoeur> $('body', $(text))  this expression returns null,
[08:54:04] <lecoeur> before append I need to proccess it, extract a body
[08:54:10] <lecoeur> and then append
[08:54:28] <IvanKuzev> can we see a sample text?

[08:55:50] <bot-t> lecoeur, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[08:55:54] <xec> thats better :D
[08:56:26] <IvanKuzev> well you can filter the $(text) to get the body only
[08:56:40] <devc> Anyways able to take a quick look at the JS Object I'm trying to structure? I can't figure out how to do a multi-dimensional object of objects of arrays
[08:56:54] <IvanKuzev> $(text).filter('body').length ..shoud be 1
[08:56:56] <lecoeur> yes, I need to get a body from text
[08:57:25] <lecoeur> 0
[08:57:42] <devc> var SuperObject = { 'object' { [0, 6], [6, 10] } }; <-- essentially like that but that's incorrect JS
[08:57:51] <lecoeur> it returns 0, this expression is the same i wrote $('body', $(text))
[08:57:54] <Littulb> Does anyone know how to detect (listen for) a change in an elements style (display, position, border type, etc.)????
[08:58:15] <devc> Littulb: what are you trying to check for?
[08:58:33] <devc> Littulb:  brb, I cna probably help
[08:58:55] <xec> devc: maybe something like { 'object': [ [0, 6], [6, 10] ] };
[08:59:07] <Littulb> devc: ok thanks.... really any change in attribute or style other than an "event" change
[08:59:19] <risky_s> hi
[08:59:29] <risky_s> html, css related question
[08:59:45] <risky_s> is there a way to apply height and width to <a>?
[09:00:09] <risky_s> I have a button with a background however the height is not enough when viewing it in Mac?
[09:00:30] <JKarsrud> risky_s: is it display: block or inline-block?
[09:00:47] <risky_s> i havent applied a display
[09:00:54] <JKarsrud> then it's inline, then.
[09:01:43] <risky_s> should I apply display:block?
[09:02:38] <JKarsrud> you could try it. It's display: inline; by default, so setting a background might prove difficult
[09:03:16] <risky_s> how about inline-block?
[09:03:23] <JKarsrud> risky_s: but if it supposed to be mimic a button, then maybe it should be a button? Unless it actually is a link?
[09:03:36] <risky_s> yer its a link
[09:04:09] <JKarsrud> risky_s: inline-block gives it the possibility of being inline, while still having block-level features, basically
[09:04:29] <JKarsrud> the content will still stay inline with text, but have width and height
[09:06:34] <AdvoWork> i normally do things like <input type="text" id="test" onchange="check_whatever();">  is there  abetter way to call functions with jquery?
[09:07:26] <JKarsrud> AdvoWork: $('#test').change(function() {check_whatever();});
[09:07:42] <RLa> i like latter better since it keeps html cleaner
[09:07:42] <IvanKuzev> ?is
[09:07:42] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[09:08:34] <JKarsrud> risky_s: http://jsfiddle.net/Yf3st/
[09:08:46] <JKarsrud> there you can see the difference between the three
[09:08:47] <devc> Littulb: The thing is you can't listen for a change in style, but you can set an interval that checks for a style change, so depending on what you're trying to do there are a number of ways to achieveit
[09:09:43] <Littulb> devc: I believe i know what ur talking about. You're saying create a setInterval to check for the criteria i need, right?
[09:11:04] <AdvoWork> JKarsrud, and thats like a listener?
[09:11:11] <JKarsrud> AdvoWork: yes
[09:12:32] <JKarsrud> it listens for the change event, and hooks up an event handler that calls your function. You could do it like this too; $('#test').change(check_whatever);
[09:13:28] <risky_s> cheers yer its worked with inline-blockk
[09:14:21] <devc> Littulb: yep!
[09:14:42] <Littulb> devc: you're the MAN!!!! um or woman!
[09:15:06] <devc> I'm half robot and half aadvark so, you were close
[09:16:18] <Milos> o:
[09:16:45] <Kingsy> can someone take a look at this --> http://renownedmedia.com/examples/nexus/ <-- and this --> http://www.kingsy.co.uk/index.php/ <-- the second one is my version and the first is the example, I am just trying to replicate that on my site then I am going to do some modding, why doesnt it work? it looks as thought the function in nexus.js isnt being called at all..
[09:17:11] <Kingsy> I must be missing something obvious.. if someone could help that would be great
[09:19:05] <Milos> is it possible to do a fadeIn() and a fadeOut() on mouseover/mouseout but that they don't queue themselves
[09:19:20] <Milos> i.e. if the mouse comes on for 2ms then it should stop trying to fade in
[09:19:30] <Milos> immediately
[09:23:41] <JKarsrud> ?queue
[09:23:42] <bot-t> .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[09:25:12] * JKarsrud Milos: are you talking about animation buildup? if that's the case look at this; http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/01/quick-tip-prevent-animation-queue-buildup
[09:25:27] <JKarsrud> Milos: http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/01/quick-tip-prevent-animation-queue-buildup
[09:25:35] <JKarsrud> it's an old trick, but it works :)
[09:25:55] <Milos> JKarsrud, perfect thank you.
[09:26:28] <Milos> LOLOOL
[09:26:33] <Milos> looks like the menu is dancing to my music
[09:26:43] <JKarsrud> heh
[09:30:38] <jedimind> Milos,
[09:30:45] <Milos> jedimind, what neb
[09:30:49] <jedimind> easier way to prevent animation bubbling like that is just to use .stop
[09:31:05] <jedimind> .stop(true, true).slideToggle()
[09:31:12] <Milos> hmm
[09:31:30] <Milos> but isn't that website suggesting using .stop() ?
[09:31:40] <jedimind> that would imply that i actually clicked on the link
[09:31:45] <Milos> :P
[09:31:46] <jedimind> u picku materinu
[09:31:52] <Milos> u picku materinu indeed
[09:37:38] <IvanKuzev> bye guys i am gonna go home to play pokemon
[09:38:09] <Genesis2001> Hmm, so I have a question. I'm using $.get() to import html from an external template that I want to display when the user clicks on a link. I have dummy divs that I can customize the template from jquery, but I don't know this won't work. http://pastebin.com/jFarhNmL
[09:38:35] <Genesis2001> inserting data into #PopupBody works, but not into #PopupTitle
[09:44:35] <shlevy> Assuming #svg-embed is SVG embedded with <embed>, running $($(#svg-embed).getSVGDocument()).click(callback) works fine but when I run it again with a second callback the first callback function is removed. Is this what's supposed to happen?
[09:45:23] <Milos> are there any tips for doing onmouseout within a container that screws up because you hover over an child element in the container which is thus technically still within bounds but yet mouseout is still fired?
[09:45:49] <JSM87> Hi guyss I have this <a href="#">Johns profile</a> : I want it so when I mouse over it changes from "My Profile" to "Click here" then if I mouse out it revers back to "Johs Profile". However, its not always going to be "Johns Profile" so can not statically define that string...
[09:47:31] <shlevy> JSM87: One option is to store the string when the document first loads
[09:47:49] <newb> hello! I have a form with 100 questions, each one with 5 radio buttons to choose one. How can I validade if all my questions are checked with jQuery?
[09:48:04] <newb> I need iterate them by name, not by ID
[09:48:57] <JSM87> shlevy: is there a better way?
[09:49:03] <JSM87> Almost like an on the fly toggle
[09:49:43] <shlevy> JSM87: There may be, that was just my first thought.
[09:49:55] <JAAulde> When selecting elements, I know that `input.foo` is faster than `.foo`, esp in IE. But what about when using `.is()`? It almost seems like it would be the reverse since there is less parsing to do of the selector and fewer checks to make against the element in question. Am I correct about this?
[09:51:01] <thinkclay> anyone have a clue as to why a jqueryui dialog would be setting to left: 0 when another one on the same page centers fine?

[09:51:36] <JillesCode_> Guys,
[09:51:52] <thinkclay> 'ello
[09:52:14] <JillesCode_> I have a div called #text, and I want the content of text to be the content of file.txt, but: $('#text').html(files/file.txt); doesn't work =(
[09:58:00] <rroelofs> JillesCode_: Of course not.  you want $('#text').load()
[09:58:01] <JAAulde> helllen: clever play on your nick w/ "helllo"!  lol
[09:58:41] <JillesCode_> rroelofs, I figured, but $('text').load("files/file.txt"); doesn't work eitgher
[09:58:44] <JillesCode_> either*
[09:59:40] <rroelofs> i was assuming files/file.txt was part of a longer url, like http://example.com/files/file.txt
[10:00:07] <JAAulde> JillesCode_: define "doesn't work"
[10:00:35] <sphinxxx> can you use .delay in conjunction with .css?
[10:01:45] <silberkristall> hi all
[10:01:48] <silberkristall> german or english?
[10:03:05] <JKarsrud> english
[10:03:13] <silberkristall> i dont realls good speak english
[10:03:15] <JAAulde> silberkristall: you'll probably get further w/ English
[10:03:50] <silberkristall> i need hel with jquery.webcam
[10:04:13] <JAAulde> silberkristall: I am willing to attempt to translate your Deutsche through Google translator
[10:04:29] <JAAulde> silberkristall: but I have never heard of jquery.webca,
[10:04:45] <JAAulde> s/webca,/webcam/
[10:05:02] <devc> Is it legal to store anonymous functions in an array? Or do they have to be in an object?
[10:05:05] <silberkristall> yes jquery.webcam
[10:05:16] <JAAulde> devc: you can store functions in an array
[10:05:29] <halcyon1234> Having problems downloading from Themeroller. Chose any theme, download .zip, get error "No files to extract". Tried through FF and IE, tried using Windows zip utility and 7zip. On XP.
[10:05:36] <halcyon1234> Anyone else having the same problem with Themeroller?
[10:05:41] <JAAulde> devc: it's great for creating an execution queue or something
[10:06:00] <silberkristall> JAAulde can you helped by jquery.webcam?
[10:06:10] * Genesis2001 wonders whether I should repaste my question
[10:06:27] <JAAulde> silberkristall: I don't know anything about it, but if you ask your question, maybe one of us can help figure it out
[10:06:39] <JAAulde> Genesis2001: go for it!
[10:06:40] <devc> JAAulde: How do you call them? I'm setting a variable, like var tmp = eval(Object.object['array'][2]); tmp();
[10:06:54] <devc> And that works but I dunno if there's a better way?
[10:07:00] <minna> Hi, um, how do i stop IE to throw error on console log?
[10:07:21] <JAAulde> devc: `var a = [];  a.push( function(){ /* func code */ } ); a[0]();
[10:07:31] <Genesis2001> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8493914/jquery-change-contents-of-element (don't feel like retyping it here)
[10:07:32] <cornfeed> .val() of a select box returns the html value="" right??
[10:08:09] <RLa> minna, catch it
[10:08:21] <minna> RLa: ?
[10:08:32] <JAAulde> minna: wrap in try/catch, OR predefine console.log where it does not exist
[10:08:38] <silberkristall> you can jquery.webcam in conjunction with flash webcam on the user (client) to access and stream it then. If I jquery.webcam with me on it and integrate access I can access my webcam but also on how other users can then view this streaming cam?
[10:08:46] <RLa> predefining would be better
[10:09:05] <ravenzz> or just fix these bugs
[10:09:06] <minna> JAAulde: Hm, i'm new to try, i'll google it. Thanks :-)
[10:09:10] <cocoadaemon> ola. Q: texteditable ? discuss.
[10:09:16] <cocoadaemon> ;)
[10:09:18] <JAAulde> silberkristall: you must be running a webserver which streams the video.  you cannot accmplish this with client-side code
[10:09:23] <dnsdds> I want to fade from background: none; to background: #fff;. How would I do that?
[10:09:41] <JAAulde> minna: `try{ console.log( 'foo' ); }catch(e){}`
[10:09:53] <silberkristall> JAAulde an stream server?
[10:10:13] <silberkristall> JAAulde ok, but how i send the stream to the server with jquery.webcam?
[10:10:25] <JAAulde> silberkristall: I don't think you can
[10:10:31] <minna> JAAulde: so i have to write that on every console.log entry?
[10:10:41] <KWhat_Work> So how do you apply a function .something() to a list of items?  Is it possible?  .find('button').button() ?
[10:10:54] <silberkristall> JAAulde how make it the xxx cam2cam sites it?
[10:11:13] <halcyon1234> Is Themeroller down? Chose any theme, download .zip, get error "No files to extract". Tried through FF and IE, tried using Windows zip utility and 7zip. On XP.
[10:11:33] <devc> JAAulde: Thanks, that worked a charm.
[10:11:42] <cocoadaemon> so seriously, does jquery offer any internal event / method I can associate to the texteditable attribute ?
[10:12:09] <JAAulde> devc: cool
[10:12:24] <JAAulde> minna: you could create a log function which does that, then call the function: function log(){try{console.log.apply( console, arguments );}catch(e){}}
[10:12:42] <JAAulde> minna: however, it is better to provide console.log where it does not exist...
[10:13:13] <RLa> instead of try/catch i have also seen if (console.log) {}
[10:14:20] <silberkristall> JAAulde you know what i mean?
[10:14:32] <minna> JAAulde: What about doing: window.console && console.log('foo bar baz', fizz, buzz); ??
[10:15:00] <JAAulde> minna: you could, but I prefer to simply do a single sniff up front to see if the support is there, and provide dummy support if not
[10:15:27] <ravenzz> minna http://paulirish.com/2009/log-a-lightweight-wrapper-for-consolelog/
[10:15:33] <JAAulde> minn something like: `(function(){var console = window.console = ( window.console || {} ); console.log = ( console.log || function(){} );}());`
[10:15:59] <JAAulde> minna: follow ravenzz's link--Paul Irish is the man
[10:16:31] <JAAulde> silberkristall: I know what you're wanting, but I do not know how to accmplish it, and I don't think the jQuery or Flash stuff will help as they are client side.  You need something which streams
[10:17:25] <minna> ravenzz: wow, nice solution! :-O
[10:17:26] <JAAulde> silberkristall: hmm, I see the project page says it can provide streaming
[10:17:54] <silberkristall> JAAulde i have a root server, thats no problem, but i dont know to use jquery.webcam
[10:18:22] <silberkristall> with jquery.webcam i can send a stream, but i dont know how can see the stream
[10:19:00] <JAAulde> silberkristall: neither do I, sorry.  Have you read the info on their page about the "callback mode", followed by the small section on "streaming"??
[10:19:16] <JAAulde> silberkristall: ok, well where are you sending it?
[10:19:21] <JAAulde> silberkristall: and in what format?
[10:20:00] <silberkristall> send on my server/website
[10:20:28] <silberkristall> format does not matter
[10:21:40] <JAAulde> silberkristall: well, if you're sending the data to the server and storing it there, then point a browser to the place where you're storing it. That's my best guess, though--I truly have no clue
[10:22:49] <silberkristall> JAAulde you mean, client "upload" to server and client 2 views the stream
[10:26:49] <halcyon1234> Is Themeroller down? Chose any theme, download .zip, get error "No files to extract". Tried through FF and IE, tried using Windows zip utility and 7zip. On XP.
[10:28:06] <shlevy> On Chrome at least, <embed> tags have an onload event. Why doesn't jquery's .load(handler) work for them?
[10:28:29] <joshsmith> when using jQuery.on(), does the object *need* to exist?
[10:29:02] <joshsmith> so $('#someId').on('click', function() {});
[10:29:17] <joshsmith> does someId really need to exist?
[10:29:46] <danzik17> joshsmith: yes, that form of on is equivalent to bind.  there are other forms that use a selector which are equivalent to live/delegate
[10:29:48] <joshsmith> previously, when using $('#someId').bind('click', function() {}); that element may not be on the page
[10:30:23] <joshsmith> danzik17: but in previous versions of jQuery I've done bind and the element may not even be there
[10:30:29] <joshsmith> it didn't throw a type error in that case
[10:30:52] <danzik17> joshsmith: it won't throw an error, but it also won't do anything.
[10:31:05] <joshsmith> danzik17: it's actually throwing an error for me
[10:31:15] <joshsmith> Object [object Object] has no method 'on'
[10:31:21] <joshsmith> maybe I'm misdiagnosing the problem
[10:31:27] <danzik17> joshsmith: you're not operating on a jquery object then
[10:31:36] <danzik17> or you're not using 1.7
[10:32:47] <joshsmith> I'm using 1.7 and it works fine on some pages
[10:32:49] <joshsmith> but not on others
[10:32:57] <joshsmith> *1.7.1
[10:33:09] <jcrawford> hey guys I have a div and I have an image set as the background, now when the mouse moves over the image div I would like to change the pointer to a hand, I have tried this $("#fanPageBtn").hover(function() { $(this).css("cursor});
[10:33:19] <shlevy> How does .click() work? It doesn't appear to be setting the onclick handler
[10:33:28] <jcrawford> hey guys I have a div and I have an image set as the background, now when the mouse moves over the image div I would like to change the pointer to a hand, I have tried this $("#fanPageBtn").hover(function() { $(this).css("cursor", "hand"); }); without any luck, thoughts?\
[10:33:54] <joshsmith> jcrawford: you should be able to do that in CSS; not necessary to do it in JS
[10:34:10] <jcrawford> joshsmith: I tried in plain css, it did not work
[10:34:16] <joshsmith> the :hover pseudo-selector is there for that
[10:34:18] <jcrawford> so I thought I would try JS to see if that would help :D
[10:34:29] <danzik17> joshsmith: best guess without looking then is you're either not operating on a jquery object, or perhaps another version of jquery is being including that's clobbering 1.7
[10:34:30] <jcrawford> joshsmith: i tried that :D
[10:34:43] <danzik17> check jQuery.fn.jquery to see what the version is
[10:35:15] <joshsmith> danzik17: yeah; hard to figure out what it is. I'm redoing the entire front end because it was a previous mess of included JS into like *every single HTML file*
[10:35:33] <joshsmith> it's loading something like 20 external scripts
[10:35:39] <jeffsmykil> Is there a better option than select[ivizr] with jquery>
[10:35:42] <joshsmith> it's ridiculous
[10:36:47] <JKarsrud> shlevy: what do you mean, don't set the onclick handler?
[10:37:27] <joshsmith> danzik17: jQuery.fn.jquery is logging 1.7.1 as expected
[10:37:43] <joshsmith> danzik17: and everything is within a document ready function
[10:38:00] <JillesCode_> XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///C:/Users/JillesCode/Documents//lang/home_nl.txt. Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[10:38:02] <JillesCode_> ?
[10:38:08] <danzik17> joshsmith: then without looking at your code or at least a jsfiddle, not gonna be able to tell you much
[10:38:09] <JKarsrud> joshsmith: maybe the scripts are linked in the wrong ordeR?
[10:38:20] <JKarsrud> JillesCode_: ajax doesn't work on a local file system
[10:38:37] <JKarsrud> JillesCode_: that is, the file: protocol
[10:38:42] <shlevy> JKarsrud: Never mind, it appears to be a peculiarity with SVG.
[10:38:58] <JillesCode_> JKarsrud it works in IE, but not in FF and Chrome, how would I fix this?
[10:39:01] <joshsmith> JKarsrud: they're in the right order
[10:39:10] <joshsmith> danzik17: this is much too massive to jsFiddle
[10:39:18] <dnsdds> I want to fade from background: none; to background: #fff;. How would I do that?
[10:39:20] <joshsmith> and I don't think I'm even allowed to share this
[10:39:26] <shlevy> Should .remove() empty the contents? Right now it's just removing the div but its contents stay
[10:39:27] <JKarsrud> JillesCode_: JillesCode_ fire it up in a local webserver then
[10:39:27] <joshsmith> Draconian workplace and all :(
[10:39:46] <JKarsrud> shlevy: well, no, it removed the dom node
[10:39:50] <JKarsrud> removes*
[10:40:03] <JKarsrud> with its content, but I don't know how well it works for svg
[10:40:23] <danzik17> joshsmith: didn't mean that you should - i meant that if you have a reduced example for jsfiddle, i'd be happy to help, but otherwise i'm just throwing out guesses
[10:40:24] <shlevy> JKarsrud: This isn't an SVG case. I've got a <div> with an <img> inside and when I call remove() on the div the img stays on the page
[10:40:41] <JKarsrud> joshsmith: it does sound like an odd problem. Maybe you're overriding jquery after the log :)
[10:40:53] <jeffsmykil> anyone adding css3 selectors to IE?
[10:40:57] <jeffsmykil> best library?
[10:41:34] <BMCouto> does events get overwrited? if a assign an event to an element, and somewhere below assign it again with more stuff how does it behaves?
[10:41:39] <shlevy> Same if I call empty()
[10:41:52] <BMCouto> jeffsmykil:  selectivizr
[10:42:22] <JKarsrud> shlevy: hmm, it seems you are right
[10:42:41] <joshsmith> JKarsrud: yeah, I found it. fucking thing was included again later
[10:42:55] <JKarsrud> joshsmith: yeah, I thought so
[10:43:20] <JKarsrud> joshsmith: maybe you should look at using requireJS with a build script? We're using that for Polly now
[10:43:38] <shlevy> JKarsrud: Is that a jquery bug?
[10:44:16] <JKarsrud> shlevy: ehm, no, I was mistaken, I had a typo in my test
[10:44:31] * JKarsrud as you can see here, it works as expected; http://jsfiddle.net/a7hvN/
[10:44:45] <JKarsrud> meh, darn space translating to /me
[10:44:50] <JKarsrud> shlevy: http://jsfiddle.net/a7hvN/ it works
[10:45:05] <shlevy> Hmm
[10:46:54] <shlevy> JKarsrud: The <img> and containing <div> were created on the fly if that matters...
[10:47:03] <shlevy> Hmm, I'll try to repro in a fiddle
[10:48:44] <JKarsrud> shlevy: ah, right, so it can be that the selector isn't fetching the expected dom nodes
[10:48:47] <jeffsmykil> BMCouto:  thank you
[10:50:07] <BMCouto> does events get overwrited? if a assign an event to an element, and somewhere below assign it again with more stuff how does it behaves?
[10:52:15] <shlevy> JKarsrud: Can't reproduce in a fiddle, but I'll upload the output of some chrome console commands
[10:55:57] <jcrawford> hey guys sorry I have an ajax() call that has a success: function defined.  However it appears to only trigger my window on the first click of the button.  When I click the button the ajax response is checked and a window shown based on response.  However if I close the window and then click the button again another ajax call is made but my window is not shown, thoguths?

[10:56:08] <LordThumper> Hi does anyone use Qtip?
[10:57:30] <shlevy> JKarsrud: Could it have something to do with it being resizable/draggable?
[10:59:18] <LordThumper> Is there any way to display a tip from javascript code (no event binding) and hide it from code again?
[10:59:35] <LordThumper> Can't seem to display a simple Qtip from code without binding it to JQuery events
[11:00:14] <ShishKabab> I have an operation that's going to take a while on the server and the server will stream back progress. What's the nicest way to follow the output that's being streamed back with jQuery?
[11:02:33] <danieliser> how can i disable a file upload field. attr('disabled', 'disabled') isnt working
[11:04:18] <BMCouto> does events get overwrited? if a assign an event to an element, and somewhere below assign it again with more stuff how does it behaves?
[11:05:41] <JAAulde> Selector Performance question: When selecting elements, I know that `input.foo` is faster than `.foo`, esp in IE. But what about when using `.is()`? It almost seems like it would be the reverse since there is less parsing to do of the selector and fewer checks to make against the element in question. Am I correct about this?
[11:13:17] <Lann> in Jquery, how do you find a specific sub element within a loop. For example I have: <div id="parent"><span class="child"><span class="badchild"></div> How can I get each badchild for a given parent?
[11:13:36] <dogarrhea2> i'm sort of getting the feeling that html5 is too little too late..
[11:13:58] <dogarrhea2> when people are already rolling their own image map pixel perfect solutions, canvas doesn't really seem so great
[11:14:03] <dogarrhea2> it'll work either way
[11:14:27] <rafacv> @BMCouto the event's handlers are chained and executed in order they were set
[11:16:21] <BMCouto> $(elem1).on('click', 'selector1',function(){ //first stuff } and after $(elem1).on('click', 'selector1',function(){ //second stuff } will they both run?
[11:16:32] <BMCouto> 'cause my second isn't...
[11:16:46] <BMCouto> rafacv:
[11:16:57] <RLa> is this cross-browser then enter key click on form field submits the form?
[11:17:05] <RLa> that*
[11:18:27] <rafacv> BMCouto: yes, both run
[11:19:08] <rafacv> BMCouto: you can see that by replacing the inners of your functions to console.log("first") and console.log("second")
[11:20:37] <RLa> seems not, then why damn ephiphany is doing it?
[11:21:03] <BMCouto> rafacv:  im trying that but it doesnt run actually my example wasn't that good (this is huge so its hard to make a jsfiddle)  but on the second, im getting to the same selector but from a different parent like $(otherElement).on('click', 'selector1'  i also thought that should work but it turns out it doesn't.. .any idea?
[11:24:22] <danieliser> how can i disable a file upload field. attr('disabled', 'disabled') isnt working
[11:25:11] <BMCouto> rafacv:  forgive my stupidnessi was doing a stopPropagation()...
[11:25:35] <rafacv> BMCouto there it is. np :-)
[11:25:36] <newb> I'm with a problem here and I'm not certainly if this is a jquery bug or not: I'm using jquery UI and a modal. Inside a modal I have radio buttons. If I click in a radio button I can't change their value. For example, I have    ( ) option 1     ( ) option 2     ( ) option 2     If i check option 1 I'm unable to click at option 1 or 3, the value can't change. And If I call "$('#inputId').trigger('c
[11:25:38] <newb> lick'); " nothing works.
[11:26:25] <newb> The same system works perfectly outside modal
[11:28:41] <dogarrhea2> is there any performance hit on page load for an image map with hundreds of coordinates?
[11:29:21] <Jon47> dogarrhea2 everything you add to a page is a performance hit
[11:29:45] <dogarrhea2> so the actual text defining all the coordinates should be ideally as small as possible?
[11:29:57] <Jon47> test it out yourself and see if it behaves acceptably in the different environments you want to support
[11:30:35] <dogarrhea2> no one else has any experience with this?

[11:36:54] <t0th> http://www.brunojk.com.br/
[11:37:17] <t0th> i have a tabs and carousel, when i click in the second tab, my carousel are stop works
[11:37:21] <t0th> how i can solve this issue?
[11:37:23] <happy> how do I grab the html from a webpage, and print it? Sorry for the newb question, but I have tried and am failing, my code is here: http://pastebin.com/w60JsFgA
[11:37:41] <wiwillia> Anyone have any recommendations for minimalist jquery sliders?
[11:37:48] <wiwillia> I think the jquery UI is pretty heavy
[11:38:28] <t0th> anybody can help me?
[11:39:01] <eddiemonge> ?sop @ happy
[11:39:02] <bot-t> happy, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[11:39:08] <t0th> any?
[11:39:12] <eddiemonge> wiwillia: define slider
[11:39:54] <guy> does jquery provide a way to parse query string?
[11:40:05] <eddiemonge> t0th: you should fix the js error although i dont think that will fix your issue
[11:40:06] <JKarsrud> nope
[11:40:12] <JKarsrud> guy: it doesn't
[11:40:13] <eddiemonge> guy: no but javascript does
[11:40:20] <guy> eddiemonge: eh?
[11:40:41] <guy> the best alternative I've found so far is
[11:40:42] <guy> http://phpjs.org/functions/parse_str:484
[11:40:56] * guy curious to hear more what eddiemonge has to say.
[11:41:12] <happy> eddiemonge: so then how do JS Ads work, how do they grab data from somewhere and display it somewhere else?
[11:41:30] <eddiemonge> t0th: you probably have to call carousel after switching tabs. and maybe look into using a current version of jquery
[11:41:42] <wiwillia> eddiemonge: simple left to right slider between values
[11:42:14] <JKarsrud> guy: there is no built in way in js, but you can use the location object in JS to find the querystring parameters
[11:42:18] <eddiemonge> happy: they use scripts and not html content
[11:42:26] <eddiemonge> guy: what JKarsrud said
[11:42:49] <Kzim> hi is there a way to have a default value for .val() if null ?
[11:42:53] <guy> its not that simple. I am getting the query out of this mess
[11:42:53] <guy> var scripts		= document.getElementsByTagName('script'); var query_str	= scripts[scripts.length - 1].src.replace(/^[^\?]+\??/,'');

[11:48:49] <dogarrhea2> any way to trigger click at specific coordinates?
[11:49:43] <eddiemonge> why would you want to?
[11:50:37] <danieliser> how can i disable a file upload field. attr('disabled', 'disabled') isnt working
[11:52:18] <eddiemonge> ?prop @ danieliser
[11:52:18] <bot-t> danieliser, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[11:54:39] <danieliser> tried .prop('disabled',true); how can i test if it disables it other than submiting the form?
[11:55:25] <eddiemonge> danieliser: console.log( $(ele)[0].disabled )
[11:57:29] <Primer> Hi, still trying to get XML using $.ajax + jsonp. Must the script the returns the XML simply wrap it in a callback with quotes, escaping any double quotes in the XML?
[11:57:52] <Primer> Seems this still fails with something trying to interpret the content
[11:57:59] <dogarrhea2> should I be worried about js Fiddle fiddle.jshell.net:22Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL ?
[11:58:04] <dogarrhea2> is that me or jsfiddle
[11:58:11] <JKarsrud> fiddle
[11:58:15] <JKarsrud> probably
[11:58:21] <wiwillia> Is there a reliable way to apply color/hue to a black and white image in Javascript?
[11:58:26] <Primer> heh, that's the same error I get when using ajax to get XML
[11:58:29] <eddiemonge> Primer: you do know what json is right?
[11:58:33] <eddiemonge> and xml?
[11:58:55] <Primer> eddiemonge: yes, I also know what jsonp is...unfortunately, there is no term for "xmlp"
[11:58:59] <danieliser> .prop is not a function is what i end up with
[11:59:17] <Primer> eddiemonge: but let's call it xmlp
[11:59:18] <eddiemonge> danieliser: what version of jq are you using?
[11:59:47] <eddiemonge> dogarrhea2: whats wrong with http://jsfiddle.net/
[11:59:53] <danieliser> what version did .prop get added?
[12:00:23] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/yej88/
[12:00:28] <eddiemonge> danieliser: 1.6 see ? prop

[12:01:32] <dogarrhea2> hrm it's gone. weird
[12:01:37] <eddiemonge> i dont see an error
[12:02:10] <eddiemonge> Primer: can you switch to json?
[12:02:53] <Primer> eddiemonge: The client wants XML, unfortunately, and it has to be cross-domain
[12:03:47] <danieliser> damn.. he is only running 1.4.4 thanks guys ill update and see whats what after
[12:03:52] <Primer> eddiemonge: For now I'd just like to get a string of XML in a jsonp callback, which seems easy enough...if only I could get jquery to stop trying to parse the string
[12:04:54] <Primer> jquery_123123_12312321("<?xml?><bla bla bla...");  <-- that is what's returned, but again, jquery thinks it's json, which it then tries to parse
[12:05:09] <Primer> I just want it to NOT parse it
[12:05:48] <Primer> Unless it's actually the newlines that's killing it...
[12:06:18] <Primer> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[12:06:19] <dogarrhea2> ok got it now. to click all elements at the same mouse position, call the trigger(e) method on all items i know that are located there
[12:09:05] <dogarrhea2> the question is now, is there a "get elements at coordinate"
[12:09:32] <Jacruth> hi guys
[12:10:40] <dogarrhea2> ok apparently there is no get elements at coordinate.
[12:10:50] <dogarrhea2> i will have to compute the location of elements as they are moving around on the screen :(
[12:13:13] <imsky> o tuesday
[12:13:44] <dogarrhea2> Tuesday stripper specials
[12:14:03] <imsky> word up
[12:15:01] <dogarrhea2> any way to find the element that is on the same hierarchy but a few pixels upwards?

[12:15:45] <vsmith> the error says http://shafteldms.diamondbuyers.com/

[12:16:32] <GarethTheGreat> quick query - select boxes and the change() event - what's the correct way to do it?
[12:16:33] <vsmith> it is saying the plugin is not a function

[12:23:54] <groovetrain> anyone have any good reading out there on Deferred/promise?  I want to call a function on the end of a timeout or an ajax call, whichever comes last
[12:25:58] <watchedman> groovetrain: you need to do it with jQuery alone? I'd recommend checking out some scriptloaders like LABjs
[12:26:47] <groovetrain> @watchedman I'd just as soon only use jQuery... but I'll also check out LABjs
[12:28:42] <Primer> Ok, I figured it out.
[12:36:58] <JSM87> Hi guys, I have a bunch of links <a href="#">Daves Profile</a> etc. I want to use jquery so that when I mouse over the link text changes to "Click here" then when mouse out it reverts back to original which would be "Daves Profile". How can I do this?
[12:39:08] <imsky> lol
[12:39:18] <imsky> JSM87, what would be the point?
[12:39:27] <PrgmrBill> to annoy the user
[12:39:31] <PrgmrBill> that's what it would do to me
[12:39:33] <JSM87> imsky: To change the text on mouse over
[12:39:44] <imsky> JSM87, why? what function would it serve?
[12:39:51] <imsky> users already know to click on links

[12:40:24] <JSM87> Cheers let me try that
[12:42:05] <groovetrain> anyone have experience with the deferred/promise apis?  Want to execute a function when a timeout completes or ajax call comes back, whichever comes last
[12:42:50] <GoGoGarrett> I'm trying to change values in a form depending on the option of a select menu, http://jsfiddle.net/TvpAZ/  this is the code I have
[12:43:09] <GoGoGarrett> It doesn't seem to replace the text when a new value is selected
[12:44:00] <groovetrain> @GoGoGarrett you should prolly just use $('#lincoln_department').val() to get the value
[12:44:14] <GoGoGarrett> the switch statement works
[12:44:25] <groovetrain> and don't assign the change() handler after the .val() method
[12:44:41] <groovetrain> get rid of that val() before change()
[12:45:11] <groovetrain> $('select#lincoln_department').change(function() {...
[12:45:30] <groovetrain> you're doing the change handler on the selected option, not the select itself
[12:48:18] <Dexec> I have an empty div element. I dynamically add <img> elements to it when the user clicks a button. To make these <img> elements sortable (with drag) with jQ UI, all I have to do is use   $( "#div-id" ).sortable();   in the head of the page?
[12:48:38] <JSM87> imsky: Hi, slight problem with the method you gave me. It works, but, as the mouse out is trying to set the html() back to what it was on page load, it is not working. I cant set it statically as each link has different text. See pastebin for layout http://pastebin.com/weJmNZGB
[12:49:29] <GoGoGarrett> thanks
[12:49:32] <groovetrain> JSM87, you could assign a 'data-original-text' attribute when changing to the hover text, then look for that again when 'unhovering'

[12:52:26] <bot-t> JSM87, Couldn't find "Hmm am I doing something wrong with the data() idea http://pastebin.com/62LrCU37" in jQuery Docs.

[12:55:31] <imsky> its tru
[12:55:53] <cambazz> hello, i got bunch of forms and using jq validate and form plugin
[12:56:07] <cambazz> i got this $('form.postForm').validate
[12:56:20] <cambazz> if any of the 'form.postForms are submitted, all the forms are validated
[12:57:57] <abjorn> ?jsfiddle @ cambazz
[12:57:57] <bot-t> cambazz, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[12:59:53] <abjorn> out of curiosity, imsky, do you use any validation plugin? I usually just do that shit mahself
[13:00:20] <imsky> serverside, i do use an existing library
[13:00:31] <GoGoGarrett> Sure did, thaks man
[13:00:33] <abjorn> but not on the jquery end
[13:00:37] <imsky> clientside though, it's usually home-brewed
[13:00:45] <big_swimmer> can someone give me a hand? my parseDocumentOutline() function isn't spitting out right, the recursion is off somehow, but i can't figure it out. i've been staring at it and poking and proding it forever http://jsfiddle.net/Vk2bB/
[13:01:03] <abjorn> werd
[13:01:13] <abjorn> it's never very hard :o
[13:01:17] <imsky> lol
[13:01:21] <abjorn> well
[13:01:24] <imsky> especially when the regexes are a google away
[13:01:25] <abjorn> nothing that ive needed to do
[13:01:35] <abjorn> srs
[13:02:07] <imsky> clientside validation is kinda a waste of time, too
[13:02:33] <imsky> anyone with firebug can do whatevs
[13:02:50] <groovetrain> imsky, agreed, especially when used without server-side validation, but it can up UX
[13:03:02] <imsky> eh we all do it anyway
[13:03:07] <danieliser> anybody on got experience with ui datepicker?
[13:03:08] <[Roosta]> i want to compare two objects to see if they live in the same <tr>, can someone point me in the right direction?
[13:03:13] <devOlsen> yes, client side validation should be considered nothing more than a UX tool.
[13:03:26] <imsky> once some sort of UI/server validation bridge comes out, we can all breathe easy
[13:03:42] <danieliser> have 2 fields start date and end date.. end date can be any date less than 90 days from start
[13:03:57] <groovetrain> imsky, I imagine you could prolly do it with sockets :)
[13:04:36] <imsky> groovetrain, you can do it with ajax. it's just not end-to-end yet
[13:05:53] <abjorn> devOlsen: It's pretty important for that, yeah. I'd rather take the extra time to write some client side validation so a user doesn't have to keep reloading a page.
[13:05:55] <imsky> anyone ever heard of a blogcast?
[13:06:00] <abjorn> nope
[13:06:08] <imsky> my book's talking about a blogcast like it's a real thing
[13:06:13] <imsky> "it's a blog and podcast in one!"
[13:06:47] <imsky> which translated means it's RSS and RSS in one
[13:06:56] <groovetrain> lol
[13:06:56] <abjorn> hahahaha
[13:07:11] <webPragmatist> any anythingslider users here? I'm trying to play a video when i click on a navigation control item. I'm not sure how to bind an additional "action" for these buttons

[13:07:52] <imsky> yeah.
[13:08:08] <danieliser> any ideas on the date pickers?
[13:08:26] <imsky> danieliser, when i was slightly younger, client asked for similar logic with the UI datepickers
[13:08:36] <imsky> after about 3 hours of dicking around with it, i wrote my own
[13:08:50] <danieliser> yea? any tips?
[13:09:17] <imsky> sure, learn how to write a jquery plugin and make sure you understand your calendar logic
[13:09:37] <danieliser> got the first down.. no simple way to do it for just one instance?
[13:10:06] <imsky> just the one? you'd have to ask a UI expert for that
[13:10:24] <imsky> UI expert = guy who figured this out after 3 months
[13:10:32] <danieliser> lol
[13:10:38] <imsky> ?g jquery ui datepicker limits
[13:10:39] <bot-t> imsky, UI/API/1.8/Datepicker - jQuery JavaScript Library - http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker
[13:11:31] <imsky> danieliser, looks like it's maxdate and mindate
[13:11:33] <imsky> good luck buddy
[13:11:42] <danieliser> thanks :)
[13:12:20] <danieliser> any idea if you can call datepicker('maxDate' on an existing instance to modify it?
[13:13:02] <imsky> danieliser, from the page: $( ".selector" ).datepicker( "option", "maxDate", '+1m +1w' );
[13:13:11] <bambams> Where is the documentation for .removeData()? O_O
[13:13:23] <imsky> bambams, what the hell is that
[13:13:25] <imsky> ?removeData
[13:13:26] <bot-t> .removeData([name]): Remove a previously-stored piece of data. http://api.jquery.com/removeData/
[13:13:37] <danieliser> i know but what im thinking is in the onselect for the min date i change the max date of the other
[13:13:38] <bambams> http://api.jquery.com/removeData/ seems to be missing it...
[13:13:38] <imsky> ^
[13:13:54] <imsky> danieliser, now you see why i wrote my own
[13:14:56] <danieliser> lol.. ty been helpful
[13:15:48] <imsky> wonder how much bullshit my book's feeding me, if it thinks blogcasts are real
[13:16:59] <groovetrain> imsky, I've read books like that-- you lose all drive to continue, just get totally disillusioned. ha
[13:17:19] <imsky> groovetrain, i'm feeling it. got 2 more chapters, very skeptical
[13:18:05] <groovetrain> imsky, maybe it was an underfunded startup, presidented by the author(s)
[13:18:38] <imsky> that seems highly specific
[13:20:01] <Dexec> Done anybody have ANY idea why this slideToggle won't work? http://jsfiddle.net/BLyLF/
[13:20:45] <groovetrain> imsky, maybe I'm the author(s)
[13:20:55] <imsky> you son of a bitch
[13:21:39] <groovetrain> BAM
[13:22:00] <bambams> WHAT? xD
[13:22:12] <Dexec> Got it, put it at bottom of body.
[13:22:19] <PrgmrBill> what's a good approach to adding ~10,000 items to a list box without breaking the browser?
[13:22:26] <PrgmrBill> adding them one at a time is really slow
[13:22:46] <imsky> PrgmrBill, wut
[13:22:48] <groovetrain> prgmrbill, can't do it server-side?
[13:22:56] <bambams> PrgmrBill: I don't think there's a good way to add 10000 items to a list box...
[13:23:03] <groovetrain> agreed
[13:23:06] <bambams> PrgmrBill: I don't think adding 10000 items to a list box is good either..
[13:23:15] <imsky> i don't think items are good
[13:23:26] <groovetrain> mmmm items
[13:23:41] <imsky> stop it you blogcasting sonofabitch
[13:24:02] <groovetrain> LOL
[13:24:10] <bambams> PrgmrBill: You'd probably be better off with some kind of search/autocomplete functionality.
[13:25:29] <PrgmrBill> heh
[13:25:37] <PrgmrBill> all right
[13:29:21] <danieliser> imsky: got it.. try something like this .datepicker( "option", "maxDate", Date(y, m, d+90) );
[13:30:24] <imsky> good job buddy
[13:32:48] <webPragmatist> blah
[13:35:09] <cjordan> Has anyone seen a problem with jquery ui icons not positioning correctly in IE running in quirks mode?
[13:37:27] <kborchers> cjordan: neither jQuery nor jQuery UI support quirks mode iirc
[13:38:12] <Jacruth> hi there, do you have any jquery example about writing an html document without using document.write?
[13:38:41] <cjordan> It's just background positioning. Any suggestions on where to go for help?

[13:38:57] <kborchers> #css

[13:39:21] <cjordan> I'll give them a try, though they've been less than helpful in the past. Thanks anyway.
[13:40:14] <ravenzz> Hopsy|2 ahah
[13:41:27] <groovetrain> Hopsyl2, it's like we're being rewarded for actually _buying_ the movie with a ridiculous amount of spam
[13:41:56] <hightekvagabond> how would one test for media in jquery such as screen vs print?
[13:42:02] <groovetrain> that was meant for Hopsy|2 as well
[13:42:06] <groovetrain> uh..
[13:42:16] <hellais> is there a sane way to build a self contained web app (i.e. one .html file and one .js file) that will then be easy to port to mobile devices (possibly also build with PhoneGap)?
[13:42:36] <hightekvagabond> hellais: Titanium
[13:42:58] <Hopsy|2> groovetrain: yes indeed
[13:43:04] <Hopsy|2> ravenzz: :)
[13:43:07] <groovetrain> hightekvagabond, I'd really love to see some dynamic content being executed on a piece of paper :)
[13:43:43] <hellais> at the moment I might have identified the technologies: jquery (ui) + backbone.js + PhoneGap
[13:44:24] <hellais> though I am unable to find best practices as of how to structure my code in a way that it is all self contained and that it will easily build on PhoneGap
[13:44:28] <groovetrain> hellias, it's not quite 'sane', but maybe sproutcore?
[13:44:40] <hellais> hightekvagabond: I don't like the idea of having to rely on commercial software
[13:44:46] <hightekvagabond> yeah, thanks for the sarcasm groovetrain, but one of my formating functions is screwing up printing, I need it to run when it is media type screen but not when it's media type print
[13:45:47] <hightekvagabond> hellais: they opensourced it
[13:45:49] <hellais> groovetrain: I looked into sproutcore, but I didn't see a lot of people using it
[13:46:19] <hellais> that's why I am asking here for people who have used these technologies
[13:46:47] <groovetrain> hightekvagabond, u got it buddy :)  seriously though, is what you're thinking of doing even possible?  I mean couldn't you just include a different stylesheet to do what you want?
[13:47:23] <hellais> hightekvagabond: where? From what I remember they only opensourced a ridiculously small part of it
[13:47:29] <groovetrain> hellias, yeah I know it.. I tried to learn it a year or so ago but gave up due to the vast hole that is there documentation
[13:47:35] <hellais> not enough for me to make my own build machine
[13:47:42] <oal> Do you know if there's an "angles"/rotation widget for jqueryui that looks something like this (only the rotation, I'm not interested in the sliders etc.)  http://cdn1.1stwebdesigner.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/tutorial-photoshop-draw-pen-envelope-52.jpg ?
[13:48:36] <hellais> groovetrain: yeah, that's why I think I might in the end go for backbone + jquery though I was looking for insight as what would be the best coding style/organization
[13:49:48] <hightekvagabond> hellias: sorry, I was just in a class on Friday for Titanium, found it very easy to use and remember the instructor saying the opensourced it, haven't looked into how limited or not limited their open sourcing was
[13:50:02] <thefalling> say i have a html that goes <select><table><tr><td><div> and i have a change event for the select, how would i grab that div? I tried $(this).siblings('table div') but that didnt work
[13:51:05] <groovetrain> thefalling, <select><OPTION><table>... ?
[13:51:08] <hellais> hightekvagabond: yeah, well unfortunately it's not fully open sourced and for my project security talibans would slap my figers if I used even just one non-opensource line of code.
[13:52:41] <thefalling> no
[13:53:14] <thefalling> my bad guess i wrote it wrong <select></select> <table><tr><td><div>
[13:53:50] <groovetrain> thefalling, you'd prolly want $(this).siblings('table').find('div') or something
[13:53:58] <thefalling> ohhh ok
[13:54:05] <hightekvagabond> It is funny how those ideals cycle in security worlds I've been at places where if it's not Microsoft it's not secure because they can't use their domain controlers on it (forget all the other holes MS puts in), I've been at places where they said Open Source wasn't secure because people could look through the code and find holes, and I've been at places where only Open Source is considered secure because they ca
[13:55:02] <thefalling> works like a charm
[13:55:04] <thefalling> thanks a lot
[13:55:28] <groovetrain> word.
[13:58:03] <dogarrhea2> so. the customer is being used as QA
[13:59:51] <hightekvagabond> groovetrain: missed your answer till I scrolled up. if it is possible or not was the question. yes, I already have a different style sheet set to media type of print, but the problem is there is a function in document.ready that is great for screen but messes up the prints. it's a plugin that we have used in a lot of places on the site I was asking the question because I just wasn't finding the right sea
[14:03:25] <Biomech> hello!
[14:04:00] <Biomech> can someone point me in the right direction. I want to have 2 divs of content, and 2 links. onclick the link replaces the visible div with the hidden (swaps them around)
[14:04:23] <Biomech> can i use an id with replaceWith() ?
[14:05:20] <hightekvagabond> biomech: why not just toggle with show and hide?
[14:05:49] <Biomech> i cant find any reference material, everything relates to changing the state of other elements, not replacing them :(
[14:06:11] <hellais> hightekvagabond: well security by obscurity may work, when *you* are the one that wrote the code (though I disagree), but in this case it written by Appcelerator.
[14:07:35] <LordThumper> Hey is there a Jquery plugin similar to this? http://www.tonylea.com/2010/jquery-easy-editable-text-fields/
[14:07:53] <hightekvagabond> hellais: I wasn't saying it was a good thing, just musing on the various phillosophies.
[14:09:02] <hightekvagabond> $('#mydivwhoneedsnewcontent').html($('#mydivwhohascontent').html());
[14:09:08] <hellais> hightekvagabond: well the security by obsucirty philosophy is fortunately being discreditted more. Any serious security or crypto software is open source, and if it isn't then you should not be using it.
[14:10:44] <hightekvagabond> hellais: I understand, I was there 15 years ago, and fought that battle I wasn't saying what was or wasn't right I get your position and I mostly agree
[14:12:06] <hightekvagabond> hellais: I still do a little bit of security by obscurity on my own servers, in that rather than run Linux I run FreeBSD, it's a lessor target. things like that but I still trust the fact that FreeBSD is open source and managed and has generally always been more secure I find it entertaining when I see things in my logs that are obvious windows and linux exploits that mean nothing to FreeBSD
[14:12:16] <alexfreewalker> hey
[14:13:14] <alexfreewalker> I have fields generated by my applicaton and I want to trigger a script when the user change the input before submitting
[14:14:10] <hightekvagabond> alexfreewalker: the keyup event could trigger a function every time there is a key stroke, the onchange event could trigger a function when the field loses focus your call
[14:14:14] <hellais> hightekvagabond: :)
[14:15:03] <alexfreewalker> ok how I am going to do this when it loses focus for all input fields ( I cant generate a class nor ID)
[14:16:25] <NoiseEee> $('.inputsWithThisClass').on('blur',functionToTrigger)
[14:16:51] <NoiseEee> or if you can't give a class, $('input').on(etc)
[14:18:13] <hightekvagabond> you could also put a function on the submit for the form itself if you don't mind waiting to run your validation
[14:19:16] <NoiseEee> yes, its a question of 'are you validating fields as they're changed' or 'are you validating a form before submission'
[14:24:01] <LordThumper> Hey is there a Jquery plugin similar to this? http://www.tonylea.com/2010/jquery-easy-editable-text-fields/
[14:24:28] <alexfreewalker> thanks!!!
[14:24:59] <hightekvagabond> LordThumper: no need to repeat yourself, it's just spammy and unproductive, if someone has an answer for you they will give it
[14:25:11] <shlevy> If I'm using jqueryui resizable on a <p>, is there any way to get the inner text to resize too?
[14:26:16] <alexfreewalker> onblur="$('#f').load('/ #f')"   This is a correct function??
[14:26:51] <sanjayb> shlevy: you'd have to attach a callback to the .resize() event and then use .css() to make the font size larger based on some calculation. not sure if there's a plugin or something for this.
[14:27:47] <shlevy> sanjayb: Ok, thanks.
[14:27:58] <alexfreewalker> NoiseEee:  $('input').on('blur',            onblur="$('#f').load('/ #f')"   how to combine??
[14:29:10] <NoiseEee> $('input').on('blur',function() { $('#f').load('/ #f') });
[14:29:17] <alexfreewalker> sorry I'm a rails programmer...
[14:30:23] <alexfreewalker> NoiseEee: thanks a lot
[14:31:29] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[14:40:25] <mathi> hi
[14:40:33] <mathi> I think i found a bug
[14:40:48] <mathi> the following gives me a syntax error in jquery javascript:
[14:40:49] <mathi> var html="\t\t\n"; $(html).each(function(){});
[14:41:29] <mathi> 1.7.1
[14:43:02] <dogarrhea2> hurray for crabs. er bugs
[14:43:19] <dogarrhea2> maybe html is a keyword
[14:43:24] <mathi> no
[14:43:33] <mathi> if I use different content it works
[14:43:38] <gkatsev> what does the error say exactly?
[14:43:48] <mathi> Syntax error, unrecognized expression:
[14:43:52] <mathi> I use the minified file
[14:44:00] <sanjayb> no, html is not a keyword
[14:44:04] <mathi> maybe I'll download the uncompressed for more details
[14:44:10] <gkatsev> mathi: you should
[14:44:16] <mathi> doing it now
[14:44:17] <gkatsev> makes life easier
[14:44:19] <mathi> hold on
[14:44:40] <ravenzz> it is a selection error
[14:44:42] <ravenzz> perhaps
[14:45:32] <neilk_> I don't see the reason why this is a bug
[14:45:44] <ravenzz> me either
[14:45:45] <ravenzz> .p
[14:45:52] <neilk_> you gave it a selector which consists of empty space, and it says that it can't recognize empty space as a selector.
[14:46:09] <neilk_> mathi^ see above.
[14:46:43] <ravenzz> var html = ""; <- the make no sense
[14:46:46] <mathi> neilk_, but I want to wrap all the HTML and loop through it ... I've always been doing like that :/
[14:46:52] <neilk_> $('#####').each(function(){});  // Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #####
[14:47:06] <mathi> so what's the correct way to do what I want to do ?
[14:47:13] <Eviltwin> WTF?
[14:47:13] <ravenzz> ..
[14:47:20] <neilk_> mathi: $() is for selecting things already in the DOM, or, if and only if it contains a tag, for creating HTML
[14:47:21] <mathi> $(html).filter('div.viewContent').each(function() { ... }
[14:47:47] <ravenzz> mathi wtf is html?
[14:47:58] <ravenzz> $('body').find()
[14:48:01] <mathi> it's a variable containing HTML, but sometimes it contains crap
[14:48:04] <neilk_> mathi: You can't create naked text nodes with jQuery. You can only create nodes surrounded by HTML tags.
[14:48:31] <neilk_> $( 'blah' );  // searches for a tag named blah.
[14:48:34] <neilk_> right?
[14:48:37] <mathi> I thought I would have an empty juery object :(
[14:48:51] <mathi> yes
[14:49:24] <mathi> neilk_, and this? $('<div>hello</div>') ?
[14:49:39] <neilk_> mathi: that creates a div node with a text node within it.
[14:50:02] <neilk_> mathi: if you want the advantage of a jquery-wrapper around unknown contents, you have to wrap it with something.
[14:50:10] <zairakai> Hi all
[14:50:14] <neilk_> like $( '<span>' + possiblyCrap + '</span>' );
[14:50:17] <mathi> thank you
[14:50:42] <neilk_> mathi: that probably will break in a lot of cases, though.
[14:50:54] <zairakai> I have a little bug with  a function. I want a return false; pour my link but I can't make that
[14:51:05] <mathi> neilk_, I can have spaces and tabs before the element ? $("\t\n\t<div>hello</div>\n\t")
[14:51:18] <neilk_> mathi: software engineering is an empirical discipline
[14:51:26] <zairakai> (if anybody speak french it's more simple for me)
[14:51:27] <neilk_> mathi: in other words, try it
[14:51:57] <neilk_> mathi: don't ask people for advice and then ignore it, it's really annoying
[14:52:19] <mathi> I don't ignore what you're saying
[14:53:33] <zairakai> Anybody can help me?
[14:53:47] <Ran> Hey, anyone has any idea how to prevent the jQuery UI Tabs briefly resizing itself to the content of all the tabs within it on page load?
[14:56:04] <shoelessone> if I have <ul><li>..</li><li>...</li><li>...</li></ul> and I select it with $("li") how could I then get the nth element? I know that I can use :nth-element(n) in the selector, but I want to do it afterwards
[14:56:27] <anli__> I need to autocomplete, but in addition to strings also have ids, can I receive objects instead of strings using .autocomplete?
[14:56:27] <shoelessone> I thought that .index(n) worked but it doesn't seem to
[14:56:35] <neilk_> shoelessone: .get(n) ?
[14:57:59] <shoelessone> Hmm... I don't think so... $("#Stuff .textpic").not(".showThis").get(number).addClass("showThis");
[14:58:26] <neilk_> shoelessone: http://api.jquery.com/get/  that's what it's supposed to do. Perhaps something else is broken.
[14:59:37] <shoelessone> neilk_: It's possible! Thanks a ton, I'll figure it out from there!
[15:00:31] <neilk_> shoelessone: oh, one thing about get, it returns an unwrapped DOM element.
[15:00:41] <shoelessone> ah
[15:00:50] <neilk_> shoelessone: so you'll have to re-wrap it to continue doing jquery stuff.
[15:03:13] <neilk_> shoelessone: oh, you could use slice
[15:03:50] <neilk_> $stuff.slice(n,1).addClass("showThis");
[15:04:06] <shoelessone> oh man, that would be great!
[15:04:12] <shoelessone> http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[15:04:13] <shoelessone> thank you!
[15:04:25] <shoelessone> I was not familiar to be honest
[15:05:33] <Ran> ?eq
[15:05:34] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[15:06:02] <neilk_> Ran: well now I feel dumb, but thanks
[15:07:13] <Ran> neilk_: Sorry, found it in the comment section of the API page you linked anyway so you shouldn't. :)
[15:07:16] <alexfreewalker> can i use a regex to target elements lik $('#REGEX').on('change',function() {...etc  ??
[15:08:11] <neilk_> alexfreewalker: what do you mean by a regex, exactly. Like, all elements matching /h\d/ ?
[15:09:12] <alexfreewalker> in my case I have an id that is generated by serever for different element id="idno_15"
[15:09:24] <alexfreewalker> server*
[15:09:24] <anli__> I am letting the autocomplete ajax call now return an array with objects where one property is named "label", now, how can I get other properties of the selected object?
[15:09:42] <alexfreewalker> where 15 is variable
[15:10:13] <neilk_> alexfreewalker: I think you really want attribute selectors. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[15:10:37] <neilk_> alexfreewalker: in particular, http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[15:11:09] <dogarrhea2> is it ok to use a js file with titled "element-beta.js" in production?
[15:13:17] <alexfreewalker> perfect
[15:13:31] <alexfreewalker> neilk_: thanks
[15:16:10] <alexfreewalker> wroked like a charm!
[15:19:34] <dogarrhea2> hurray. i get around the "pixel perfect" mouse collission
[15:19:49] <coldhead> collision*
[15:20:28] <dogarrhea2> 1. image map. 2.  pass the default part of the area event to the parent. 3.  parent computes which element was behind the transparent part using the x, y coordinates. 4. extra s due to exccitement
[15:20:44] <coldhead> hahaha
[15:22:36] <dogarrhea2> now, how do you do this with an animating gif..
[15:23:02] <erichynds> watttttt

[15:27:24] <butat> didnt read
[15:27:47] <dogarrhea2> the are rewriting jquery ui lol
[15:27:58] <Ran> Huh?
[15:28:29] <dogarrhea2> where's our Jquery UI community manager
[15:28:39] <dogarrhea2> he may be able to offer more info
[15:29:09] <Ran> :S
[15:29:15] <butat> never reading your chats
[15:29:34] <dogarrhea2> butat are you talking to yourself?

[15:33:58] <dogarrhea2> hrm if you want pretty photos, i suggest scantily clad women under 40
[15:34:46] <chuck_tes> YES!
[15:34:51] <chuck_tes> WOW!lol
[15:35:47] <solidus-river> anyone here know how i can prepend li's to a ul thats scrollable but keep the ul scrolled so that the view is in the same state it was before the new li's were added?
[15:35:51] <chuck_tes> I can't believe I actually got it. The problem was that in the script I was supposed to insert in the header, the author left it as: <script src="js/jquery.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
[15:36:06] <solidus-river> e.g. prepend elements to the top but dont change the view from the end users perspective
[15:36:13] <butat> channer detected
[15:36:30] <LordThumper> Why is $(event.target).hide() working while $(event.target).next().hide() is not?
[15:36:38] <LordThumper> Cannot seem to get next() and prev() working
[15:36:56] <Ran> solidus-river: How's the scrolling done? A custom scroll or by the user-agent?
[15:37:08] <devOlsen> LordThumper is indeed next or prev of the same element type that event.target is?
[15:37:13] <chuck_tes> But I was suspicious because within the js directory there was no jqeuery.js file, there was however what appeared to be several versions of jquery. So I changed it for jquery-1.6.1.js and it worked. Thanks anyways
[15:37:25] <devOlsen> other wise, unless you say next('div') or prev('div'), there is no next or prev div.
[15:37:45] <LordThumper> devOlsen: Ah that is the problem, thanks alot
[15:37:47] <solidus-river> Ran: I'm not sure I understand the question. overflow on the ul is set to auto, the user has most likely scrolled aproximately to the top of the list
[15:37:48] <devOlsen> np
[15:38:37] <LordThumper> Would prev('.class') work?
[15:38:41] <ekkis> I'm having trouble with a simple case using the jquery cycle plugin.  would someone take a peek? http://jsfiddle.net/eTysX/
[15:38:50] <devOlsen> yes
[15:38:51] <devOlsen> should
[15:39:08] <LordThumper> thanks
[15:39:12] <Ran> solidus-river: Ok so overflow, thus the scrollbar is the normal scrolling by the browser and not a custom implementation.. anyway you can get and set the current scroll amount through DOM.
[15:40:10] <Ran> solidus-river: So get the current scroll (and scroll max), append/prepend, then set scroll again.
[15:40:38] <devOlsen> Ran + the height of the new added item.
[15:40:44] <dogarrhea2> dog
[15:40:46] <dogarrhea2> oops
[15:41:46] <hotchpotch> hi
[15:41:50] <devOlsen> if it was an append then incorporating the newly added item's height to the mix of scroll to point would not make sense, but he stated prepend, and there for adds height to the scroll amount.
[15:41:54] <devOlsen> just an FYI
[15:42:41] <ekkis> anyone here use the cycle plugin?  I'm having issues with it
[15:43:13] <Ran> solidus-river: Use the "scrollTop" property on the DOM element, to get the DOM element through the jQuery object use .get(0)
[15:44:09] <hotchpotch> i have like a $.ajax() within a window mask (jquery("#mask1").css()) and another one (jquery("#msg2").css()). however, i see the #mask1 and #msg2 only after the ajax event has completed. what's wrong here?
[15:44:24] <devOlsen> ekkis I tried to take a look at your JSFiddle, but when a person fails to even hookin jquery to their fiddle and then asks the jquery room for help, I tend to close that link up fast.
[15:44:38] <devOlsen> get the plugins "plugged in" to your jsfiddle and I would be more included to take a look.
[15:44:58] <dogarrhea2> "inclined"
[15:45:01] <hotchpotch> this only happens on google chrome
[15:45:25] <devOlsen> thanks dogarrhea2 don't know what I would do with your ya ;)
[15:45:46] <ekkis> devOlsen: you know, the weird thing is I use jsfiddle all the time, and somehow this time I took it for granted it was included!  duh!
[15:46:03] <dogarrhea2> #include <spellcheck.h>
[15:46:14] <dogarrhea2> oops wrong channel
[15:46:38] <hotchpotch> anyone? :)
[15:47:18] <hotchpotch> commenting out $.ajax() seems to show both #mask1 and #msg2
[15:47:36] <Ran> Seems I disconnected, did you get my reply solidus?
[15:50:25] <solidus-river> Ran: yeah, thanks for the reply! i was on the phone, I'm going to go try to impliment it, I'm worried that will be jarring for the user though
[15:50:46] <solidus-river> Ran: I could animate the scroll immediatly before adding the elements, perhaps that would keep it fixed
[15:53:11] <LordThumper> Does think make sense ? $(event.target).prev('.FilterTextBox').show();
[15:53:14] <LordThumper> I am totally stuck
[15:53:34] <Ran> solidus-river: Hmm.. well, if the scroll is at the top it will be 0, if you then add another element of say 20 points height, it'll still be 0, but 20 would be where 0 used to be.
[15:54:56] <Ran> solidus-river: So if you just prepend and immediately change the scrolling by that amount, it should not appear like anything changed apart from scrollbar getting more room to move up if that's what you're going for.
[15:55:43] <Knuxgen> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/ajax-and-charset-on-request-header
[15:55:46] <solidus-river> Ran: thats a good idea, i should do away with smooth scrolling for prepending
[15:55:52] <Knuxgen> i have the same problem, googled only this :/
[15:56:45] <xwurf> hi i use a javascript onclick event to modify the hash of the url via window.location.hash. now i have two different links; each of them with an onclick-event an each of them modify the hash differently. now, modification with first links works but modification with second link does never change the url... any idea what could be the reason?
[15:57:20] <hotchpotch> async:false in $.ajax returns the control immediately yes?
[15:57:34] <solidus-river> Ran: worked like a charm :)
[15:57:43] <Ran> solidus-river: Glad to hear. :)
[15:58:53] <Ran> hotchpotch: Async means it will return the results in a callback and not "inline", so if you take it out it blocks your script from further execution till the ajax request is done.
[15:59:38] <hotchpotch> Ran,  so the default is asyn:false?
[15:59:42] <hotchpotch> async
[16:00:25] <hotchpotch> Ran, the modal css() isn't doing what its suppose to. I am trying to show a progress bar
[16:00:29] <Ran> hotchpotch: I believe async is used by default, false would likely mean it's not in-use.
[16:00:42] <hotchpotch> the call returns immediately whether i do async:false/true Ran.
[16:00:57] <Ran> ?css
[16:00:58] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[16:01:12] <hotchpotch> Ran, it's a modal windows
[16:01:14] <hotchpotch> window
[16:01:36] <hotchpotch> if i remove the $.ajax call, it shows up just fine. i emulate $.ajax by setTimeout()
[16:02:09] <Ran> hotchpotch: Are you providing the ajax a (reference to a) callback function?
[16:02:37] <hotchpotch> Ran, you mean like success/error handler?
[16:02:51] <hotchpotch> in that case, i am.
[16:03:17] <Ran> hotchpotch: Ajax is supposed to return instantly, because it's asynchronous, and it then returns the results of the requests to the callback function once complete, not as a return value of the call.
[16:03:54] <hotchpotch> Ran, the handler is picking up except the modal window css is showing up only after the ajax completes
[16:04:26] <hotchpotch> so it's like i am waiting all the way for few seconds and the window (css) shows up only after several seconds
[16:05:18] <mightym> hey guys I'm new to query, id like to highlight divs in which textareas contain a string type in an input field. i used keyup() to check the input and pass the string to sty like $('textarea:contains('" + searchterm "')).addClass('highlight') . but i don't get any results  someone hint for me what I'm doing wrong?
[16:05:23] <Ran> hotchpotch: Is the css applied after or before the ajax request is made then? Maybe you have async turned off in that case.
[16:05:49] <hotchpotch> the css is applied before once and once after.
[16:06:19] <hotchpotch> so it's like the $.ajax completes, the css should go away
[16:06:31] <xwurf> question: if i have a java-script function which calls this function .... 	$('#'+id+' tr').mouseover(function() {....} then the jquery-function is executed from now in parallel?
[16:06:40] <ekkis> this works in Chrome but doesn't even run in IE9 - wtf? http://jsfiddle.net/eTysX/8/
[16:06:41] <hotchpotch> i should try maybe putting in the callback
[16:06:44] <hotchpotch> Ran, good idea
[16:06:51] <hotchpotch> thanks
[16:07:50] <Ran> hotchpotch: The callback is executed immediately as your request completes, so if you want the window to go away when that happens try putting a .hide() there I guess.
[16:08:06] <hotchpotch> Ran, yep that's it
[16:08:18] <hotchpotch> Ran, thanks tons
[16:08:19] <hotchpotch> :D
[16:08:25] <Ran> hotchpotch: Np. :)
[16:08:36] <hotchpotch> Ran, instead of after the $.ajax(), i put it within success handler
[16:08:38] <hotchpotch> :)
[16:08:40] <hotchpotch> cool
[16:08:49] <hotchpotch> works
[16:08:54] <Ran> ^^
[16:10:03] <ekkis> oh why is IE such a PITA???
[16:10:26] <coldhead> because "i'm number 1 so why try harder"
[16:10:56] <ekkis> xwurf: what do you mean "in parallel"?
[16:11:18] <ekkis> coldhead: I can't even get this very simple thing to run in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/eTysX/8/
[16:11:29] <mightym> thy anyway!
[16:17:30] <xwurf> ekkis: concurrent
[16:17:48] <Ran> ekkis: What you linked runs fine, just that it takes time to start 'cause the images aren't loading (for me at least), and thus the page isn't 'ready' I guess.
[16:18:41] <ekkis> Ran: thanks for checking... I arrived at the same conclusion... it was running ok on Chrome cuz it had the images cached...
[16:19:21] <ekkis> xwurf: well, the handler will run triggered, if that answers your question
[16:19:52] <ekkis> Ran: my server was down... I think I damaged it last night and now it's rebooting itself every so often... grr...
[16:21:17] <chovy> hi
[16:21:18] <xwurf> ekkis: ok thx
[16:21:34] <chovy> how do i get the last item in a list like this:
[16:21:50] <chovy> $(".foo").find("input"); I want only the last input in the list returned.
[16:22:20] <ekkis> chovy: $(".foo:last-child") IIRC
[16:22:48] <ekkis> or $(".foo").last()
[16:23:06] <xwurf> gn8
[16:26:49] <freenodiz> why none here have ip recordes?does everyone is behind a proxy?i'm just using a cloak
[16:29:52] <killtime> any good software out there to creat object models?
[16:30:36] <silverwind> Hey all, what is a good modal box gallery plugin? I tried nyromodal, found it very nice but difficult to style (Close to impossible without modifying the JS)
[16:35:16] <techouse> hey!
[16:36:18] <techouse> i got something like this <label>mytext</label>. how do i make jquery insert mytext into a span and make it like this <label><span>mytext</span></label>?
[16:36:36] <groovetrain> thefalling: do you remember who was on here earlier asking about jQuery being able to sense if the page was media:print?
[16:36:50] <groovetrain> becuase I think I figured it out...
[16:37:54] <groovetrain> techouse: $('label').html( '<span>' + $('label').text() + '</span>' );
[16:38:06] <techouse> aha, ok :)
[16:38:15] <groovetrain> or something like that anyway...
[16:38:35] <killtime> pls guys help me
[16:38:57] <killtime> where do i start if i just wanna build a class/object model of my project
[16:38:57] <killtime> ?
[16:39:29] <groovetrain> killtime: honestly the way I leaned was to just look at those who went before me, and...
[16:40:17] <groovetrain> killtime: they are going to be updating the docs soon too (as mentioned in the comments) http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[16:40:22] <snover> killtime: jquery is not the library for you if you are trying to create classes
[16:40:59] <killtime> i figured
[16:41:04] <killtime> i came here because of JSON
[16:41:18] <killtime> im trying to build a JSON API out of my own models/classes
[16:41:24] <killtime> i just dont know where to start
[16:41:30] <killtime> the info on google is a mess
[16:41:56] <groovetrain> killtime: ah
[16:41:58] <snover> killtime: use dojo or mootools or just plain javascript
[16:42:16] <silverwind> killtime, what is your language? PHP?
[16:42:18] <snover> though thats not a very clear explanation of what exactly you are doing
[16:42:20] <groovetrain> killtime: also could take a look at prototype.js, but I'd totally just use vanilla js
[16:42:33] <killtime> js is the lang
[16:42:41] <killtime> yea i kno snover
[16:42:51] <killtime> i figured talkin to ppl can help me gain some clarity
[16:43:06] <killtime> i been tackling this for weeks ... goin kinda insane
[16:43:10] <killtime> but im learning alot
[16:43:59] <groovetrain> killtime: just keep goin! keep yourself distracted with related projects that you can go to when you hit roadblocks
[16:44:31] <killtime> ahhh groove wisdom thats been relayed to me by many recently
[16:44:48] <techouse> groovetrain: thanx man! just helped me solve my ie text-shadow function )
[16:44:49] <techouse> :)
[16:45:19] <techouse> looks more of a hack, but what da hell :)
[16:45:51] <techouse> everything written for ie is a hack :P
[16:46:03] <groovetrain> techouse: HA!  so sad, but true.
[16:46:13] <groovetrain> and you're welcome
[16:46:25] <techouse> if anyone wants the solution to this problem, i can share :)
[16:47:19] <techouse> basically what i did is take the text, copy it into 2 spans, and place one above the other, then nudge one a bit up and left and the other a bit down and right
[16:47:26] <techouse> there's the basic text shadow

[16:49:26] <groovetrain> techouse: that's pretty good thinkin dude
[16:49:35] <LordThumper> Nothing you can do expect pray to the javascript god
[16:49:44] <groovetrain> ha
[16:49:47] <techouse> yea...well :) still requires some css to do it, but it's basically it
[16:50:00] <gnarf> that was a really odd spam...
[16:50:08] <jaequery> is there way that lets you add an element to beginning of an array?    currently .push() just adds to end of an array
[16:50:09] <gnarf> can anyone decode that? :)
[16:50:14] <techouse> looked like base 64 encode to me
[16:50:19] <gnarf> jaequery: .splice(0,0,elem)
[16:50:31] <gnarf> jaequery: also see .unshift()
[16:50:36] <gnarf> ?mdc unshift
[16:50:37] <bot-t> gnarf, unshift - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift
[16:50:55] <groovetrain> holy crap, gnarf, I gotta try that
[16:51:03] <groovetrain> ?mdc crapface
[16:51:04] <bot-t> groovetrain, No results found for 'crapface'.
[16:51:07] <groovetrain> dang...
[16:51:45] <techouse> groovetrain: is there any jquery option that can blur text?
[16:51:59] <jaequery> gnarf: no it stillty
[16:52:06] <techouse> obviously not css related...since ie :P
[16:52:07] <jaequery> gnarf: thx
[16:52:26] <groovetrain> techouse: how blurred?
[16:52:30] <techouse> doesn't matter
[16:52:31] <groovetrain> (no)
[16:52:36] <techouse> just simple blur :D
[16:52:59] <techouse> cuz the scary ms filter blur makes a mess of things
[16:53:06] <groovetrain> you could try something similar just kinda increase font size a little and do the span thing multiple times, changing opacity, etc.
[16:53:20] <techouse> yea...thought of that too
[16:53:21] <techouse> :)
[16:53:27] <groovetrain> suuuuure
[16:53:35] <techouse> have to find a simple solution for a dinosaur browser
[16:54:02] <techouse> been looking for about 4 hours how to fix the ie text shadow issue, so trust me, it came across my mind :D
[16:54:08] <groovetrain> welp. kids gotta go down

[17:01:00] <coldhead> i wish i could understand his strange beautiful monkey language
[17:01:17] <gnarf> maybe people in Jakarta just talk that way
[17:01:41] <coldhead> i liked the bit about riggy diggy
[17:01:51] <Ran> Maybe he was just from a more advanced species than we are. ^^ We'll never know.
[17:07:37] <kenthree> why was .tmpl ditched?
[17:13:35] <wiwillia> Does anyone know a good, lightweight slider plugin for jQuery?  Outside of the UI system?
[17:16:49] <mdunham918_> is there a way to make a border animated? like in photoshop you know where the dashed borders dashes move around the bo
[17:18:10] <coldhead> mdunham918_: http://jsfiddle.net/desandro/zm7Et/
[17:18:40] <rue> Marquee tags with really small text?
[17:19:08] <mdunham918_> coldhead:  thanks for the example nice
[17:19:30] <coldhead> don't thank me, thank google :)
[17:19:55] <peterschmidler> Has anyone any clue, why this doesn't work: $('body').css("padding-top","+=1em"); $('body').css("background-color","#000");
[17:20:31] <silverwind> Because it doesn't make sense..
[17:20:51] <peterschmidler> silverwind: But you know what I intended?
[17:20:52] <silverwind> The color should be fine though.
[17:21:25] <mdunham918_> peterschmidler: $('body').animate({"padding-top": "+=1em"}, 0); $('body').css("background-color","#000");
[17:21:56] <mdunham918_> peterschmidler: actually: $('body').animate({"padding-top": "+=1em"}, 0).css("background-color","#000");
[17:22:10] <peterschmidler> silverwind: cool!
[17:22:35] <mdunham918_> ....
[17:29:51] <groovetrain> hightekvagabond: dude
[17:30:12] <groovetrain> hightekvagabond: I think I figured it out
[17:31:00] <groovetrain> start here: http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/08/combining_media.html
[17:32:33] <hightekvagabond> ok, so, I've proven to myself that document.ready does not fire on print page in firefox. is there an event that does fire?
[17:33:10] <groovetrain> no, my idea was to apply something inside of a '@media all' block
[17:33:20] <groovetrain> that would hide a certain page element
[17:33:40] <groovetrain> then in jQuery, you could just do something like $(el).is(':hidden')
[17:33:55] <hightekvagabond> right, but I'm not looking to hide an element, I'm looking to undo the scrolling headers plugin that was added to the table which destroys formats for printing
[17:34:20] <groovetrain> ooooh ok, that's different
[17:35:01] <groovetrain> hmmm
[17:35:09] <groovetrain> wait
[17:35:15] <groovetrain> I think it would still work
[17:35:24] <hightekvagabond> I thought we were looking at a page refresh for printing, so I created a div and gave it different properties in the @media print than in standard, then in the document.ready where I apply the scrollingheaders I just wrapped it in an if, but that didn't seem to exicute
[17:35:48] <groovetrain> do something like:
[17:36:02] <groovetrain> in your stylesheet @media print {
[17:36:13] <groovetrain>   .print-hide { display: none; }
[17:36:13] <groovetrain> }
[17:36:27] <groovetrain> then in jQuery you could do:
[17:36:55] <groovetrain> if( $('.print-hide').is(':hidden') ) { //Don't do scrolling headers }
[17:37:11] <hightekvagabond> yep, that is basically what I did
[17:37:14] <hightekvagabond> fail
[17:37:50] <groovetrain> well dangatrons... if anything comes to me, I'll post in here
[17:38:42] <hightekvagabond> I actually made a little plugin that tells me which media (well I ganked it from someone else and modified it), and running that pluging through document.ready I get screen both in print and in non print
[17:44:34] <abjorn> sometimes I hate regular expressions
[17:45:05] <groovetrain> amen to that
[17:47:26] <hightekvagabond> regex's are fine, JS just impliments them weird. I miss perl when I have to deal with regex
[17:47:42] <hightekvagabond> groovetrain: here is an example of how I was testing print:  http://gypsy.org/test/checkprint/
[17:51:02] <surfdue> Hellers
[17:51:18] <surfdue> unrecognized expression: # - line = if(i%2) $('#' + rows[i].id).addClass('alt');
[17:51:23] <surfdue> any reason that wont work?
[17:53:59] <Eviltwin> Yeah, you can't set a variable equal to an if statement
[17:54:37] <wiwillia> Hi - how do I detect keypresses when a certain input[type=text] is being typed into?
[17:54:39] <Eviltwin> abjorn: I hate how limited POSIX regular expressions are compared to the mathematical definition
[17:54:59] <Eviltwin> wiwillia: $("input[name=foo]").keypress(function(e){...})
[17:55:09] <Eviltwin> surfdue: What
[17:55:11] <wiwillia> oaky thanks
[17:55:12] <Eviltwin> 's your goal there?
[17:55:46] <surfdue> Eviltwin: well rows[i] is a regular javascript object, I need to set its class.
[17:55:47] <wiwillia> Eviltwin: thanks.
[17:56:01] <Eviltwin> surfdue: What'd there an if involved?
[17:56:09] <Eviltwin> Why's*
[17:56:11] <surfdue> Eviltwin: so it does it on every second one. :)
[17:56:14] <surfdue> we are in a javascript for here
[17:58:05] <Eviltwin> surfdue: Why's there a line = at the beginning?
[18:00:51] <surfdue> -.-
[18:01:47] <h4ruh1> w00t
[18:05:36] <Eviltwin> surfdue: ?
[18:11:06] <hightekvagabond> Eviltwin: you weren't around earlier when I was looking for an event triggered by printing, are you aware of one in jquery? since document.ready is not triggered by print
[18:11:25] <Eviltwin> Wait, what?
[18:11:29] <Eviltwin> By print?
[18:11:43] <hightekvagabond> yeah, an event that fires when someone goes to print a page
[18:12:03] <Eviltwin> Oh, I didn't have anything to do with that discussion then
[18:12:32] <hightekvagabond> no, that is what I am saying, you weren't around earlier when we had this dicussion and I was hoping you had some light to shed
[18:13:28] <Eviltwin> I have no idea how to do it in other browsers but this apparently works in IE5+: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536788%28VS.85%29.aspx
[18:15:07] <Eviltwin> I frankly doubt there's anything universal
[18:15:34] <hightekvagabond> yeah, thats what it seems like :(
[18:16:07] <Eviltwin> hightekvagabond: Just poked at Google Docs
[18:16:19] <Eviltwin> Looks like they're probably listening to keydown on Ctrl/Apple and P
[18:16:34] <Eviltwin> And they use that to open a new window
[18:16:40] <hightekvagabond> interesting
[18:16:52] <Eviltwin> However going to File > Print does not trigger a Ctrl/Apple and P
[18:16:57] <hightekvagabond> I'd of never thought to insert myself in front of the hot key
[18:17:25] <snover> Eviltwin: there has not been an apple key for likeat least half a decade
[18:17:29] <snover> it is the command key
[18:17:49] <Eviltwin> snover: Yes, I as a Mac user know that, most Windows users do not
[18:18:32] <hightekvagabond> bah, it will always be the apple key to me no matter what word they put on it :P
[18:19:42] <Eviltwin> It's probably because there's a (useless) Windows key on PCs
[18:19:58] <snover> hey, windows+l is useful
[18:20:08] <Eviltwin> But the Command key on Macs is closer to the functionality of the Control K on Windows
[18:20:10] <snover> also if you use linux, you can use it as the global hotkey key
[18:20:12] <Eviltwin> Control key*
[18:20:17] <snover> which is pretty awesome
[18:20:39] <Eviltwin> OS X uses the Control key for its Unix functionality
[18:20:44] <Eviltwin> (i.e. what it would be used for in Unix)
[18:20:53] <Eviltwin> And the Command key for the OS X functionality
[18:22:12] <wiwillia> Is there a way to not strip new lines when I use $(element).html(output)?
[18:22:14] <wiwillia> if I alert output
[18:22:18] <wiwillia> I see correct foramtting
[18:22:29] <wiwillia> if I .html it into a visual debugger div
[18:22:32] <wiwillia> It strips the new lines
[18:22:55] <Eviltwin> wiwillia: No, I believe it is an inherent limitation in the way .innerHTML works in many browsers
[18:22:58] <Eviltwin> Why?
[18:23:04] <Eviltwin> Are you inserting this into a <pre> or something?
[18:23:27] <wiwillia> just a consolue
[18:23:35] <Eviltwin> ?
[18:24:05] <Eviltwin> You shouldn't be using the console for actual live sites
[18:24:17] <wiwillia> this is just for internal debugging
[18:24:30] <snover> wiwillia: your debugger is probably at fault
[18:24:32] <Eviltwin> How are the newlines relative then?
[18:24:34] <snover> use chrome
[18:24:46] <wiwillia> snover and just dump()?
[18:24:47] <Eviltwin> Or if you're just interested in the next content, try .text()
[18:24:49] <snover> alsooooo, the serialization of the DOM is not the same coming out as it was going in
[18:24:49] <Eviltwin> Instead of .html()
[18:24:57] <snover> it never will be
[18:24:58] <snover> so dont ask
[18:25:13] <guzzlefry> should I learn JavaScript before playing with JQuery?
[18:25:20] <snover> yes
[18:25:36] <Eviltwin> Absolutely, guzzlefry
[18:27:41] <hightekvagabond> My boss has made a command decision that printing is more important then sortable scrollable floating head tables and this headache can just go away. and the crowd rejoiced
[18:28:56] <hightekvagabond> I've really come to hate that plugin
[18:29:10] <Eviltwin> hightekvagabond: You know about print CSS, right?
[18:29:37] <hightekvagabond> yep
[18:29:50] <Eviltwin> Does that not work for you?
[18:30:13] <hightekvagabond> this plugin does a bunch of stuff to the table when you run it, and there is no real way to undo it using print.css
[18:30:35] <wiwillia> is there an if statement I can use to check if parseFloat failed?  Will if(var == "NaN") work?
[18:30:47] <Eviltwin> Nope
[18:30:56] <Eviltwin> But if(isNaN(var)) will work
[18:31:03] <wiwillia> thanks Eviltwin
[18:45:30] <dismist> how come i cant do $('select').load('file.txt'); if file.txt contains just <option>test</option> ?
[18:47:58] <Spadeski> http://75.219.226.179/Gotactics/          On the right there is an orange Div that is news ticker I would like to get my latest RSS feeds and append them to the list as it scrolls
[18:56:19] <wiwillia> Can I prevent the .keyup function from running if an arrow key has been pressed?
[18:57:30] <ndss56> wiwillia: ignore it when arrow key is pressed.
[19:02:21] <wiwillia> ndss56 any better way to detect changes in length then storing a global var?  I want to basically stop propogation of the event for all non-length-changing events.
[19:04:30] <ndss56> wiwillia: what event has length?
[19:04:41] <dismist> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html  can anyone tell if it possible with that optionset for the "popovers" to prevent them from closing when they are hovered over? so i can include a link on them?
[19:05:53] <wiwillia> ndss56 I meant stop the element.keyup function from running if the element.val().length has not changed.  I could store a var I guess.
[19:06:59] <ndss56> wiwillia: do that.
[19:11:20] <punno> hey all, how would i go about creating a click event that triggers when you click anywhere on the page except on a certain div or anything inside of it?
[19:13:52] <kborchers> ?g benalman outside events @ punno
[19:13:53] <bot-t> punno, Ben Alman  jQuery outside events: Why trigger an event on ... - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[19:14:37] <clarkfischer> you could just do a $('body').click and check to see if this or this's ancestors match a selector, right?
[19:19:10] <^zoggy^> https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=15101
[19:21:23] <punno> yeah but it kept returning the body as this, aha - e.target
[19:34:56] <chovy> how do i set z-index with $(".foo").css({ z-index: -100 }); it doesn't seem to work.
[19:36:45] <gkatsev> chovy: .css('zIndex', -100)
[19:37:10] <gkatsev> oh, hm... I guess the above may have supposed to work.
[19:39:27] <dismist> whats the jquery for clicking anywhere BUT on a specific element?
[19:40:27] <chovy> dismist: is there a css selector for not() ?
[19:40:48] <chovy> you can attach an event ot the body and check the target if it's the one you want to ignore.
[19:41:07] <gkatsev> three is a css selector for not
[19:41:13] <gkatsev> there
[19:43:21] <chovy> dismist: $(document).delegate("a.something:not", 'click', function(e){ });
[19:43:29] <chovy> not sure if that would do what you want. or even work.
[19:43:35] <acidjazz> ok i asked a version of this questoin before and this time i dont know what to do
[19:43:58] <acidjazz> http://pastebin.com/PcQFu4ry
[19:44:18] <acidjazz> looping through making an object w/ functions .. the variables i pass like sections[i] only the last value is placed
[19:44:23] <acidjazz> any easy fix for this?
[19:46:01] <acidjazz> http://pastebin.com/PcQFu4ry
[19:46:09] <acidjazz> woops already pasted
[19:46:37] <Eviltwin> Solution 1: Use a $.each
[19:46:53] <Eviltwin> Solution 2: Use a (function(i){...})(i) wrapper
[19:50:39] <acidjazz> ok ill try .each
[19:50:50] <dismist> its a command i know they just added recently
[19:50:58] <Eviltwin> What?
[19:50:59] <acidjazz> how do i do that objimade.each(function(index, value) {    });
[19:51:10] <Eviltwin> acidjazz: Nope
[19:51:22] <Eviltwin> $.each(sections,function(i,section) { ... })
[19:51:34] <acidjazz> tnx
[19:51:45] <Eviltwin> dismist: There's nothing native for clicking on anything but a target
[19:52:21] <acidjazz> Eviltwin: 2 is a closure right?
[19:52:27] <Eviltwin> Correct
[19:52:32] <acidjazz> Eviltwin: which do you suggest
[19:52:32] <Eviltwin> And actually 1 is technically a closure too
[19:53:07] <acidjazz> and 1 last question.. lets say you're writing the code that executes this bject of functions
[19:53:33] <Eviltwin> dismist: I think you're looking for this: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/ba-jquery-outside-events-plugin
[19:53:48] <acidjazz> do you just do something like obj[index](); ?
[19:53:54] <Eviltwin> Yes
[19:53:58] <acidjazz> if i pass a closure wont htat break?
[19:54:05] <Eviltwin> What?
[19:54:26] <acidjazz> if  you make obj['eviltwin'] = (function(etc) { etcetc; }(etc));
[19:54:30] <dismist> chovy: $(document).delegate("$('#pastebox'):not", 'click', function(e){ $('#pastebox').modal('hide'); });   this works but i click on anything and it closes?  how would i do #pastebox and all of its children
[19:54:33] <acidjazz> wont obj['eviltwin'](); break?
[19:54:47] <Eviltwin> Well that's not what I'm telling you to do
[19:55:15] <Eviltwin> I'm actually telling you to do (function(etc) { obj['eviltwin'] = etcetc; })(etc);
[19:56:25] <dismist> #pastebox, #pastebox * ?
[19:56:39] <acidjazz> i need the value of obj to be the function Eviltwin
[19:56:48] <acidjazz> the thing i pass it to executes that function
[19:56:55] <dismist> still closes that mothafuckin btich
[19:56:55] <Eviltwin> Can we move this to a jsFiddle
[19:56:56] <Eviltwin> ?cik
[19:56:56] <bot-t> Code is King. We can't always understand your explanation of the problem but we all speak code here. Try to make a live (working) demo of your problem at jsfiddle.net
[19:57:42] <Eviltwin> acidjazz: http://jsfiddle.net/KpJkc/
[19:58:59] <Eviltwin> dismist: I suspect you don't understand event bubbling
[19:59:32] <Eviltwin> Using the * is almost universally a bad idea
[20:00:14] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/Nvskp/
[20:00:17] <Eviltwin> For you, dismist
[20:08:43] <dogarrhea2> http://jsfiddle.net/yej88/12/
[20:08:58] <Eviltwin> Oh Christ
[20:09:03] <dogarrhea2> is there any way to tell whether or not the container event listener was triggered by "trigger" or
[20:09:18] <dogarrhea2> by an actual click on a child element within the container
[20:09:45] <Eviltwin> Two ways
[20:09:49] <Eviltwin> You can stop the event from bubbling
[20:10:02] <Eviltwin> Using e.stopPropagation()
[20:10:15] <Eviltwin> Not the right answer if you are interested in that event somewhere further up the DOM
[20:10:23] <Eviltwin> The other thing is checking if this === e.target
[20:11:22] <raz> how do i select for existence of a data-foo attribute?
[20:11:31] <raz> $("div[data-foo]") does not match anything
[20:11:49] <dogarrhea2> btw, why the "Oh Christ" comment
[20:15:12] <dogarrhea2> cool. i think i'm going to abuse e.stopPropagation() eerywhere now
[20:16:35] <h4ruh1> raz: if it's not too specific, you can $('[data-foo]')
[20:16:47] <coldhead> your code maintainers wil curse you for it, dogarrhea2 :)
[20:16:56] <raz> h4ruh1: doesn't work. jquery selectors apparently don't see data-attributes.
[20:17:03] <raz> just found this tho: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4198403/jquery-1-4-4-how-to-find-an-element-based-on-its-data-attribute-value
[20:17:13] <dogarrhea2> coldhead, as long as it does what I need it to do heh
[20:17:32] <h4ruh1> raz: works for me, I'm using 1.7.1 though. :/
[20:18:38] <raz> h4ruh1: are you sure?  i'm on 1.7.1, too
[20:18:43] <raz> definitely doesn't work here :(
[20:20:00] <dogarrhea2> coldhead, also, what the heck is a "code maintainer" these days anyways... it's some kid who doesn't know better who just graduated and then looks at someone else's code and screams and goes into managemnet.
[20:20:39] <dogarrhea2> they are rewriting jquery ui as we speak no? it's hard to get an idea of what's goin on..
[20:21:53] <h4ruh1> raz: take a look => http://jsfiddle.net/8rATv/
[20:22:02] <raz> h4ruh1: wow, yea, i found the problem
[20:22:19] <kborchers> dogarrhea2: interactions are being rewritten (draggable, droppable, etc.)
[20:22:36] <kborchers> there are open meetings on wednesdays if you are interested in what is going on
[20:22:48] <dogarrhea2> where at?
[20:23:02] <kborchers> #jquery-meeting
[20:23:23] <h4ruh1> raz: what's the problem? Share, 'coz I might someday encounter it. :D
[20:23:37] <raz> h4ruh1: it seems the selectors don't work on <script> elements for some reason. curiously it *does* work on jsfiddle. found this about the issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2787566/jquery-selector-problem-with-script-tags
[20:23:59] <dr0id> kborchers: I cannot send to that channe;
[20:24:15] <kborchers> it is muted when a meeting is not being held
[20:24:15] <raz> sounds like a scoping issue, but i'm loading jquery just normally, no idea what's going on :/
[20:32:27] <tready> Hello All, is there a way to use .live with a .each loop?  I've google the heck out of it and can't find an answer....
[20:33:18] <crab> what do you mean?
[20:33:42] <tready> well, I have newly added elements on a page and I need to do an each loop on them
[20:51:06] <y3di> is $.get() asynchronous?
[20:51:53] <X99> tready:these elements have the same tag name or class name ?
[20:52:27] <tready> .notes is the class name
[20:52:55] <`h4ruh1`> y3di: yupp
[20:53:17] <y3di> ty
[20:57:22] <X99> try this: $(".notes").each(function() { //some code});
[20:59:43] <tready> doesn't work.  I even tried just changing to to $('.notes').live( function() { // some code }); and the functions inside fail and throw an error saying that event.replace is not a function
[21:00:53] <tready> here is the jQuery code http://pastebin.com/04jpJx9s
[21:05:28] <`h4ruh1`> tready: shouldn't it be $(selector).live('EVENT_HERE', function() { ... }); ?
[21:07:25] <tready> I tried that also and it failed as well
[21:08:27] <Cork> tready: what event are you trying to catch?
[21:08:30] <tready> oh wait, I see what you are saying but I have no idea what event would go there since I replace the .each() with .live()
[21:08:38] <tready> replaced*
[21:08:54] <Cork> tready: each and live has nothing to do with eachother
[21:09:05] <Cork> one loops over elements the other adds an event listner
[21:09:43] <Cork> tready: so, what is it your trying to do?
[21:12:05] <Cork> tready: from skimming the bug, you need to use live with valid selectors for the mouseover and mouseout events, and adjust the rest of the code to handle that
[21:12:13] <Cork> *skimming the pb
[21:13:27] <`h4ruh1`> tready: It should look like this $('.bubbleInfo').live('mouseover', function() { ... }).live('mouseout', function() { ... }); I suggest using use delegate() or on() (v1.7.1)
[21:13:28] <tready> I have to use .live because the elements are newly added
[21:14:10] <Cork> tready: you can't use live as a replacement for each, it just doens't work like that
[21:15:09] <tready> I got you....i put each back and then changed .mouseout to .live('mouseout', etc
[21:15:46] <Cork> tready: that only works if no '.bubbleInfo' is ever added
[21:16:59] <Cork> tready: else you need to change the approche
[21:17:18] <y3di> why do i need jsonp=? in my $.get() calls
[21:17:24] <y3di> what does that even do
[21:18:06] <Cork> y3di: it tells jquery to use script tags to load the json as jsonp
[21:18:35] <Cork> the ? is replaced by jquery with a generated uniq function name that it will call when its loaded
[21:18:53] <idea4good4me> hi all  can any body help me with this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8498059/json-jqgrid-handling-hashmap-in-json-grid-not-displaying
[21:19:09] <tready> thanks for the help guys, i think i got it now!!!
[21:19:25] <Cork> y3di: the jsonp server is meant to call its javascript function whats in that param
[21:22:45] <y3di> ok ty for the explanation cork
[21:23:34] <Cork> y3di: though you would have to have some extra settings for that to work
[21:23:50] <Cork> as the default jquery name for that param is callback not jsonp
[21:24:48] <idea4good4me> Cork: can you please lookinto this
[21:27:08] <oojacoboo> so, I have a form with 2 submit buttons, they don't have to be submit buttons, but they both would submit the form, just with different results.  How would I append an additional parameter to a submit button for processing?  Is that possible?
[21:27:48] <oojacoboo> I'm pretty sure that standard form handling won't support this, and that I need to do an if onClick and then set a var and pass that in the POST?
[21:28:26] <Cork> idea4good4me: your rows value are wrong
[21:28:50] <Cork> idea4good4me: your sending an object with strink "numberic" keys instead of an array
[21:28:53] <Cork> http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:retrieving_data
[21:29:49] <idea4good4me> yeah rows contains actual hashmap with (integer,value)
[21:30:17] <Cork> oojacoboo: objects, javascript doesn't have hash
[21:30:26] <Cork> idea4good4me: it needs to be an array
[21:30:40] <`h4ruh1`> oojacoboo: you can modify the form parameter by using serialize() or serializeArray() then modify it to your needs.
[21:30:45] <sacho_unreg> oojacoboo, why not have a hidden field which you modify on the mentioned onclick?
[21:30:57] <idea4good4me> so jsonreader just accepts array nothing else?
[21:30:59] <sacho_unreg> or you could go the full-blown do-it-yourself route ^
[21:31:05] <igore> ui-sortable-helper is alwasy z-index: 1000
[21:31:13] <igore> is there a way to increase that?
[21:31:19] <Cork> idea4good4me: the data you send is in the form of { "9":{}, "10":{} }, it needs to be in the form [{},{}]
[21:31:30] <igore> I can't do it in CSS because its set inline when I called the .sortable()
[21:31:31] <Cork> idea4good4me: check the link i gave you
[21:31:45] <oojacoboo> sacho_unreg: yep, best idea
[21:31:48] <oojacoboo> thanks
[21:33:12] <sacho_unreg> you may want to even use onsubmit
[21:33:27] <oojacoboo> onsubmit where?
[21:33:33] <oojacoboo> the form is ajax submitted anyway...
[21:34:03] <sacho_unreg> ah ok
[21:34:49] <panfist> i had a question about jquery ui tabs, regarding the spinner option. i don't like how the string replaces the tab name because it can sometimes cause the interface to reflow rapidly...is it possible to just leave the tab name alone?
[21:34:56] <Cork> oojacoboo: http://jsfiddle.net/XxbBz/
[21:35:05] <panfist> nevermind
[21:35:57] <oojacoboo> Cork: undefined.. what does that show me?
[21:36:02] <Cork> oojacoboo: bah, looks like thats browser specific, ya
[21:36:08] <Cork> one min
[21:39:23] <Cork> oojacoboo: bla... looks like there isn't a value to check cross browsers
[21:39:33] <Cork> oojacoboo: so ya, your stuck with .click
[21:39:50] <oojacoboo> I'm not even sure that having more than one submit is valid html anyway
[21:40:09] <Cork> it is
[21:40:41] <oojacoboo> k, so, where would I put the click event, before or after the .submit() ?
[21:40:45] <oojacoboo> :/
[21:42:36] <`h4ruh1`> oojacoboo: is this what you're trying to do? http://jsfiddle.net/TT4u8/
[21:42:52] <Cork> oojacoboo: http://jsfiddle.net/XxbBz/2/
[21:42:56] <Cork> cleaner :)
[21:43:42] <sacho_unreg> oojacoboo, why not do it on the .submit()?
[21:43:53] <sacho_unreg> oh, it depends on which button was clicked?
[21:43:59] <oojacoboo> sacho_unreg: yea duh...
[21:44:10] <oojacoboo> :)
[21:44:30] <Cork> oojacoboo: anyway submit-button will hold a pointer to the clicked button
[21:44:32] <oojacoboo> well actually
[21:44:45] <sacho_unreg> I doubt the order you registers events in would matter
[21:44:48] <Cork> if you like you can add the data your interested in on the submit button
[21:45:15] <oojacoboo> Cork: can you attach name to submit buttons?
[21:45:22] <oojacoboo> so you can get the parameter server-side
[21:45:57] <Cork> oojacoboo: i know ex .net does it, but if i remember correctly dosen't work in all browsers
[21:46:07] <oojacoboo> yea
[21:46:50] <Cork> oojacoboo: if thats all you want just add a hidden field, and set its value in the :submit event
[21:47:03] <oojacoboo> yea, that's what I'll have to do
[21:47:25] <oojacoboo> to make matters even more complex, I've gotta send back results to the js to do more stuff with :P
[21:48:00] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/XxbBz/4/
[21:48:26] <Cork> oojacoboo: na, that doesn't really matter, just add an .submit event on the form, and do .serialize or .serializeArray
[21:48:50] <Squarism> does anyone know a java-framework that can deserialize typical json.param query strings.. like : a[one]=1&a[two]=2&a[three]=3&b[]=1&b[]=2&b[]=3&mltilvl[0][1]=2mltilvl[1][1]=2
[21:49:12] <oojacoboo> yea, that's prob what I'll do, thanks
[21:49:35] <Cork> uh.. helps if i can spell ;P http://jsfiddle.net/XxbBz/5/
[22:04:24] <oojacoboo> cork, is there an inherent different between that :submit pseudo selector and the .submit function?
[22:04:35] <Cork> yes
[22:04:45] <Cork> one is a selector the other is an event listner
[22:04:59] <oojacoboo> right, but the trigger is the same?
[22:34:20] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: http://api.jquery.com/submit-selector/
[22:34:52] <Eviltwin> Used to *select* submit buttons
[22:34:59] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[22:35:11] <Eviltwin> Used to bind to or trigger submut *events*
[22:35:11] <oojacoboo> yea, I see
[22:35:35] <oojacoboo> I wasn't familiar with that pseudo selector
[22:35:44] <oojacoboo> I'm guessing that's a jquery thing
[22:36:19] <oojacoboo> whereas, with many similar pseudo selectors, it's based on an event
[22:37:04] <Eviltwin> What?
[22:37:20] <Eviltwin> Oh, you mean like :hover
[22:37:29] <oojacoboo> sure, or :active
[22:37:52] <Eviltwin> While it might seem like it's based on an "event"
[22:37:56] <Eviltwin> It's actually based on a state
[22:38:01] <Eviltwin> A state that changed with the event
[22:38:06] <oojacoboo> true
[22:38:20] <Eviltwin> Notice that an element keeps its :hover style after the hover event is long finished
[22:38:22] <oojacoboo> but submit is neither
[22:38:31] <Eviltwin> No
[22:38:34] <oojacoboo> it's just a shortcut for type="submit"
[22:38:34] <Eviltwin> :submit is a state
[22:38:40] <Eviltwin> Whether or not it's a submit button
[22:38:42] <oojacoboo> it's not really that either
[22:38:44] <Eviltwin> Something either is or it isnt
[22:38:47] <oojacoboo> it's just an attr
[22:38:48] <Spadeski> Sup Eviltwin
[22:38:49] <Eviltwin> And that state can change
[22:38:58] <Eviltwin> I go in and make it type="text"
[22:39:01] <Eviltwin> And now :submit no longer matches it
[22:39:11] <oojacoboo> right, it's an attr
[22:39:20] <oojacoboo> you can't change the :hover state like that
[22:39:23] <oojacoboo> or that :active
[22:40:04] <oojacoboo> apparently it's not very efficient either I wonder why even have it
[22:40:32] <Eviltwin> Because it's not just [type="submit"]
[22:40:47] <oojacoboo> ok, what else is it?
[22:40:57] <CapitalCUNextTue> woh woh
[22:41:01] <Eviltwin> It's that for an input
[22:41:01] <CapitalCUNextTue> Bark
[22:41:03] <Eviltwin> Or a button
[22:41:17] <Eviltwin> Or if it's a button with no type specified
[22:41:22] <Eviltwin> In which case it defaults to a submit button
[22:41:33] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: that's bad html
[22:41:41] <oojacoboo> that shouldn't be happening regardless
[22:41:42] <Eviltwin> That's a set standard though
[22:41:45] <CapitalCUNextTue> Your ad httml
[22:41:52] <oojacoboo> I see...
[22:41:52] <CapitalCUNextTue> damn keyboard
[22:42:10] <Eviltwin> So $(":submit") vs $("input[type=submit], button[type=submit], button[type=]")
[22:42:20] <oojacoboo> right
[22:42:21] <Eviltwin> Or however you're supposed to do that last one
[22:42:30] <Eviltwin> Maybe button:not([type])
[22:42:32] <oojacoboo> it covers for an html default and bad html
[22:42:43] <Eviltwin> How is that bad HTML?
[22:42:46] <Eviltwin> It's transitional HTML
[22:42:53] <Eviltwin> HTML4 doesn't have <button>s
[22:42:55] <oojacoboo> button without the type is bad html
[22:43:08] <Eviltwin> HTML5 highly suggests the use of <button>s
[22:43:10] <oojacoboo> yes it does
[22:43:20] <oojacoboo> html 4 does have buttons
[22:43:35] <oojacoboo> 4.0.1 if you want to be specific
[22:44:36] <Eviltwin> Oh, sorry, I must be thinking of something else
[22:44:38] <Eviltwin> Anyway
[22:44:48] <Eviltwin> jQuery is loaded with lots of things that could be done a different way
[22:44:49] <oojacoboo> you're thinking of the new <menu>
[22:44:51] <Eviltwin> That's no reason not to have them
[22:46:05] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: anyway, thanks for clearing that up ;)
[22:46:52] <Eviltwin> No problem
[22:47:47] <baldaris> my current li a clicked is stored in a var , when a user clicks on another li a item , is there a way to get previus li a item and manipulate it?
[22:48:30] <Eviltwin> baldaris: So they're clicking on an <li><a> and you want to get the <a> inside the previous <li>?
[22:48:40] <Eviltwin> The previous one they clicked or the previous one in DOM order?
[22:49:49] <baldaris> Eviltwin:yeah thats correct
[22:50:07] <baldaris> previous clicked a , could be any a in li
[22:51:06] <baldaris> once a click event is generated , need to show current div , and hide previous div which was showing
[22:51:28] <baldaris> div ids are generated via php
[22:51:58] <baldaris> Eviltwin:i think we were talking 2 days back but i got dc..remember?
[22:53:12] <Eviltwin> I honestly don't. I help so many people here.
[22:53:39] <Eviltwin> Are you looking for something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/L2Ubg/
[22:58:39] <crab> maybe your good twin was helping baldaris, and that's why you don't remember.
[22:59:17] <crab> did people change their mind about including jquery-tmpl in core?
[22:59:40] <Eviltwin> What do you mean change their mind?
[22:59:52] <Eviltwin> They decided tmpl was a bad idea and are no longer supporting or developing it
[23:00:07] <crab> it was supposed to be in 1.6, but then wasn't, and... well, there you go.
[23:00:20] <snover> it was a flip flop.
[23:00:21] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[23:00:23] <Eviltwin> Look in red at the top
[23:00:40] <snover> yes, that was after they promised templating would be in core
[23:00:45] <snover> oh well
[23:00:47] <crab> i didn't know. why did they decide it was bad?
[23:00:58] <snover> because it was developed by one dude at microsoft who refused to write unit tests
[23:01:00] <Eviltwin> While I didn't use it much
[23:01:05] <snover> and then he moved onto write other stuff
[23:01:12] <Eviltwin> I found it to be something of a hassle and limiting
[23:01:27] <snover> this has been your jquery history lesson for the evening
[23:01:30] <snover> thanks for listening
[23:01:41] <crab> Eviltwin: i'm depending on it for one app. do you know of any good alternatives?
[23:01:48] <snover> crab: use underscore.
[23:02:03] <Eviltwin> It's not like they decided to break it
[23:02:07] <Eviltwin> They just aren't making new versions
[23:02:19] <crab> yes, i realise that.
[23:02:38] <crab> but it seems unwise not to explore alternatives when it's been abandoned.

[23:04:09] <dr0id> abandonware, lol
[23:05:06] <crab> yes, i was asking for recommendations about "some other way"s. underscore is one, and i see dust.js is another.
[23:05:09] <crab> must explore.
[23:06:02] <Eviltwin> We went massively off the deep end with our solution
[23:06:07] <Eviltwin> Can't say I recommend it
[23:06:23] <Eviltwin> But as a result, I've never needed to learn about the other solutions
[23:06:58] <crab> you wrote your own?
[23:07:28] <crab> handlebars.js, neat.
[23:07:59] <crab> these are all pretty similar.
[23:11:15] <dnsdds> Inside the custom helper function of jQuery UI draggable, how can I select the original object or any copy of it, as I need the data inside it?

[23:15:29] <vladikoff> Obvious_MkII, hi
[23:16:01] <varnie> good day.

[23:16:24] <coldhead> sup varnie
[23:16:51] <varnie> is it possible to somehow lock button while "$.post" has not finished in its click handler?
[23:17:12] <Eviltwin> Lock how?
[23:17:22] <varnie> that button from being clicked again
[23:17:41] <varnie> the problem is that that $.post performs too quickly and it is still possible to click that button more and more
[23:17:53] <Eviltwin> That's usually not a sign of it being too quick
[23:18:15] <IvanKuzev> rather of being too slow
[23:18:41] <IvanKuzev> use some variable..or change the text and then check for it before executing another post
[23:18:58] <IvanKuzev> or just disable the button
[23:19:38] <varnie> here is my simplified code-snippet: http://pastebin.com/aWXYZyMb
[23:20:09] <noaXess> morning
[23:20:23] <varnie> it works, but it is still possible to click it many times while it's being performing...
[23:20:56] <varnie> I would be really grateful for any advices.
[23:21:38] <Eviltwin> vladikoff: http://jsfiddle.net/WCcd3/
[23:21:44] <Eviltwin> Err
[23:21:46] <Eviltwin> varnie: http://jsfiddle.net/WCcd3/
[23:22:26] <vladikoff> Eviltwin, coool
[23:22:45] <varnie> Eviltwin, I tried that approach with logical flag (as your isBusy)
[23:22:45] <Eviltwin> It really is, isn't it?
[23:22:58] <Eviltwin> varnie: You probably just didn't scope it right
[23:23:59] <varnie> no, I put it right before click handler, (as you did), check for its value in the very beginning of click handler, and reset it in the $.post function ;)
[23:24:28] <varnie> and what's not so good with my approach using data() method?
[23:24:29] <Eviltwin> .removeData doesn't take params as far as I know
[23:24:42] <Eviltwin> it just removes every piece of data from the element
[23:24:44] <Eviltwin> Including event listeners
[23:24:49] <Eviltwin> So I highly suggest you don't do that
[23:25:12] <varnie> and what's the correct way of removing specific item from the data?
[23:25:26] <Eviltwin> jQuery(".lockable").data("lock", undefined);
[23:25:34] <noaXess> try to implement ui autocomplete, code http://paste.ubuntu.com/769770/, i get json data back: http://paste.ubuntu.com/769771/ but the automcomplete dropdown is empty... http://i.imgur.com/UtSXo.png
[23:25:35] <noaXess> any hint?
[23:25:41] <Eviltwin> Perhaps
[23:26:03] <Eviltwin> noaXess: Don't ever work with autocomplete, sorry
[23:26:09] <varnie> and apart from that my approach is correct, what do you think?
[23:26:28] <Eviltwin> That multiple things are messing with .lockable?
[23:26:39] <Eviltwin> That the element with .lockable doesn't exist?
[23:26:58] <varnie> it exists
[23:27:00] <webPragmatist> you noobie noobsters
[23:27:08] <Eviltwin> From what you've described, this calls for a var, not .data()
[23:27:08] <webPragmatist> yawwwn
[23:27:22] <Eviltwin> Hah
[23:27:29] <Eviltwin> What a fantastic contribution from webPragmatist
[23:29:05] <Eviltwin> It's computationally slow
[23:29:10] <Eviltwin> To use .data
[23:30:45] <Eviltwin> Also pretty sure you want .closest("form") not .parents("form")
[23:32:10] <donCams> zup
[23:32:32] <varnie> damn...
[23:32:49] <varnie> it works running on my local webserver, but it doesn't work on the server...
[23:33:04] <varnie> it is still possible to do many clicks while it is handling $.post
[23:33:31] <Eviltwin> Probably has to do with cache / you-didn't-actually-push-those-changes syndrome
[23:34:00] <Cork> Eviltwin: side note you should use removeData instead of , undefined);
[23:34:59] <varnie> so removeData was okay?

[23:36:43] <Cork> vladikoff: thx
[23:36:47] <noaXess> thanks vladikoff
[23:36:53] <minna> that is probably the person who never got any help... he have been here several times.
[23:37:00] <Pallet> anyone ?
[23:37:05] <varnie> it works pretty well locally.
[23:37:06] <vladikoff> minna, aww
[23:37:12] <Cork> Pallet: you should prob ask your question again :)
[23:37:13] <Eviltwin> Cork: Just read the source for removeData. It wasn't well documented on api.jquery.com
[23:37:22] <frenocha> hi
[23:37:25] <Pallet> can you see www.purchaseseal.com ?
[23:37:36] <frenocha> Pallet: I see a website...
[23:37:41] <Pallet> ok cool
[23:37:44] <minna> Pallet: yes, i see it
[23:37:44] <Pallet> I don't
[23:37:44] <Cork> Eviltwin: it is, just search for data and you'll find it
[23:37:45] <varnie> what can I do with cache to fix that?
[23:37:53] <dnsdds> Inside the custom helper function of jQuery UI draggable, how can I select the original object or any copy of it, as I need the data inside it?
[23:37:55] <Pallet> ok, well as long as you guys can
[23:37:56] <Eviltwin> Cork: I went to http://api.jquery.com/removeData/
[23:38:01] <frenocha> Pallet: check your hosts, maybe dns is outdated, et cetera?
[23:38:10] <Cork> varnie: you can avoid the cache through an option to ajax
[23:38:11] <frenocha> Pallet: but it's a grey, orange and white website here
[23:38:18] <noaXess> Pallet: yes.. http://i.imgur.com/cCqwA.png
[23:38:27] <Eviltwin> In fact http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.removeData/ points you to http://api.jquery.com/removeData/
[23:38:29] <Cork> varnie:your using post right?
[23:38:34] <varnie> yes I am
[23:38:34] <vladikoff> Pallet, i see it!
[23:38:42] <Pallet> thanks people
[23:38:47] <Cork> varnie: posts is never cached, so that shouldn't be a problem
[23:38:51] <Pallet> looks like my DNS has f**ked up ;)
[23:39:16] <Cork> varnie: unless you have a broken proxy inbetween that is
[23:39:23] <frenocha> Pallet: old version of jquery on that website, though ;)
[23:39:30] <varnie> I am behind vpn
[23:39:48] <varnie> i.e. I connect to that webserver over openvpn routes
[23:39:49] <Cork> varnie: you have a pb for your problem?
[23:39:56] <varnie> pb?:)
[23:39:57] <Pallet> frenocha, yeh I know ;)
[23:39:59] <Pallet> thanks
[23:40:04] <Cork> pastebin (ex. jsfiddle)
[23:40:08] <Eviltwin> Anyway guys
[23:40:14] <Eviltwin> I was planning to wake up in 4 hours
[23:40:19] <Eviltwin> So I'll be heading out
[23:40:22] <Cork> :D
[23:40:25] <Cork> sleep tight
[23:40:29] <Eviltwin> Thanks
[23:40:31] <Eviltwin> You too
[23:40:37] <Cork> heh hope not :)
[23:40:40] <varnie> here it is, but it is not jsfiddle, sorry: http://pastebin.com/VkTYAGHU
[23:40:42] <Cork> 08:40:41
[23:40:44] <Cork> :D
[23:41:00] <Eviltwin> You'll have to sleep eventually
[23:41:33] <Cork> :)
[23:41:35] <Cork> true
[23:41:36] <Eviltwin> varnie: Lines 24-31 are a little shady
[23:42:14] <Cork> varnie: this is just a side note, but you should use true instead of 1 when you set "lock"
[23:42:22] <varnie> they checks whether there're the required data.
[23:42:26] <Cork> then you lose some type conversions
[23:42:33] <Cork> and the code becomes easier to read
[23:42:53] <varnie> I see
[23:43:32] <Cork> varnie: parents is a bit risky if you nest forms, so closest is prob a safer bet
[23:43:49] <Cork> and your fetching the form data twice, you could just have sent formData
[23:44:03] <Cork> (in line 36)
[23:44:22] <varnie> I would like to solve that 'many clicks' issue.
[23:44:29] <varnie> the problem is that that code isn't mine to say the truth.
[23:44:31] <Cork> line 46 should be replaced with removeData
[23:44:46] <varnie> I tried, but no luck
[23:45:13] <Cork> varnie: if you comment out line 46
[23:45:24] <Cork> does the button stay the way you want it (yes indefenitly)
[23:45:40] <Cork> just want to make sure it actaully does what you want it to
[23:45:51] <varnie> yes it is always there
[23:45:55] <varnie> it is visible and enabled
[23:46:13] <Cork> so even if line 46 is commented out
[23:46:17] <Cork> you can click multible times?
[23:46:24] <varnie> one moment, I'll try it again
[23:46:33] <dirkpennings> is there some nice overview of keypress, keyup, keydown events order across browsers?
[23:46:41] <gnarf> thx vladikoff
[23:46:45] <gnarf> didn't notice that spam
[23:47:08] <Cork> dirkpennings: keydown => keypress (repeded if key hold down) => keyup
[23:47:15] <varnie> Cork, now that button got pressed only one time
[23:47:21] <Cork> dirkpennings: all browser that follows the dom spec should do it
[23:47:27] <varnie> and after that it cannot be clicked
[23:47:31] <Cork> varnie: good so the block works at least
[23:47:59] <Cork> varnie: you could try adding some extra delay to the inlock
[23:48:18] <varnie> I'd say that $.post runs very quickly, so the whole 'set lock/remove lock' part occurs too quickly as well
[23:48:37] <Cork> replacing line 46 with: setTimeout(function() { jQuery(".lockable").removeData('lock'); }, 1000);
[23:48:43] <varnie> so it works, but it doesn't give us much profit
[23:48:52] <varnie> one moment please...
[23:49:12] <Cork> if thats not enough uncrease 1000
[23:49:18] <Cork> *increase
[23:49:48] <varnie> hehe, not it gets better;)
[23:50:10] <varnie> but still I can click it while its $.post running
[23:50:10] <Cork> 1000 is one sec so just set it to how much extra time you want
[23:50:56] <Cork> varnie: it lockes too late?
[23:51:17] <varnie> hmmm..
[23:51:34] <varnie> I put 1500 ms and now it works I'd say well
[23:51:41] <Cork> ok
[23:52:01] <varnie> thank you guys, you made my day, really
[23:52:14] <Cork> 1.5 seconds, i don't think anyone will care if they have to wait that ;)
[23:52:17] <ragas> if i say this.before(that) why does it put that before this?
[23:52:21] <Cork> varnie: good luck
[23:53:02] <varnie> Cork, on the production webserver it works well, and I don't see any "delays"
[23:53:08] <varnie> it works as it should to
[23:53:38] <varnie> but I am sure if I'll run it on my local webserver I'll notice some delays
[23:53:40] <Cork> varnie: there is one, the reason you don't feel it is cause the servers response is almost instant
[23:53:55] <varnie> yes, essentially.
[23:54:02] <Cork> varnie: a used on a slow (high ping time) will feel it
[23:54:14] <Cork> but if they have a long ping time 1.5 seconds won't really matter

[23:56:03] <noaXess> does anybody know, ho i can use another jquery-ui css for ui autocomplete? i have a main ui css and a custom css... eg. in the dialog, i can set class: 'custom'...
[23:56:15] <gnarf> heh
[23:56:28] <gnarf> if that happens again btw, and no ops are around, let them know in #freenode
[23:56:40] <Cork> gnarf: i usually do that :)
[23:57:21] <Cork> noaXess: you mean you want a special css for a single autocomplete or all?
[23:57:37] <noaXess> Cork for a single, yes...
[23:57:46] <Cork> ah
[23:59:38] <gnarf> Cork: you seem to be actually here, hang on to it in case that guy finds his way back
[23:59:48] <gnarf> last time i had to ban like 5 of him
