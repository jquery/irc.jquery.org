[00:00:20] <momito> does anyone know if .css can function in combination with .load?
[00:00:48] <djquery> Murugaratham: see ?ask
[00:00:48] <bot-t1> Murugaratham, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:01:18] <coldhead> sure it can, momito
[00:01:22] <coldhead> ?tias
[00:01:22] <bot-t1> Try It And See
[00:01:32] <Murugaratham> is there anyway to perform arithmetic calculations on jQuery templates?
[00:01:41] <Murugaratham> like a ${count -1}
[00:01:54] <makinen> I've attached elastic plugin to a textarea. How can I ask for it to grow elesewhere in the code?
[00:03:31] <djquery> Murugaratham:  {{myfunc}}

[00:07:25] <ridethefire122> no ideas djquery?
[00:08:27] <djquery> ridethefire122: I would check the jplayer.org website

[00:10:02] <ridethefire122> oh wow
[00:10:05] <momito> ok is there a way to execute a fadeIn after an image has been completely loaded through .css backgroundimage?
[00:10:32] <djquery> ridethefire122: then there is this also http://drupal.org/project/jplayer
[00:12:06] <momito> assuming the .ready function cant be used inside another function
[00:12:11] <djquery> momito: not that I know of. I could probably put a hack together
[00:13:14] <momito> hmm what kind of hack djquery ? it would be nice if i could understand it also so i will program my scripts better in the future :P

[00:32:07] <gnarf> KREGI: jquery selector language is the same as css
[00:32:09] <gnarf> so ".selected"
[00:32:10] <niftylettuce> momito: ^^

[00:33:40] <momito> so if i get it correctly, you need a complete new ui before tomorrow?
[00:33:51] <pifantastic> coldhead: you're so naive
[00:34:02] <glaksmono> how do you check for checked checkboxes for all of them in class .className?
[00:34:07] <KREGI> but I have a lot of mb on the page class = "selected">, I need a specific example div class = 'select2'
[00:34:32] <pifantastic> glaksmono:  $('.className :checked')

[00:35:06] <glaksmono> pifantastic: what's the output of that? is it returning an array?

[00:36:27] <toxz> any idea - why i always get 'on' when clicking the checkbox? http://jsfiddle.net/NjYE4/
[00:37:22] <niftylettuce> momito: for future ref, got a www?
[00:37:26] <gnarf> KREGI: be more specific then
[00:37:31] <gnarf> describe how you will know which element you want
[00:37:36] <gnarf> and write the selector

[00:38:58] <gnarf> ?doesn't work
[00:38:59] <bot-t1> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.

[00:54:56] <ocf> My boss said to me today: "I think the best way to do that would be to create a jquery class containing 6 properties: ContractNumber, ContractDescription ... etc"  - is he talking about doing OOP with jQuery and, if so, any good resources? Never done OOP in JS.
[00:55:11] <ocf> I played along like I knew what he meant, of course :)
[00:55:28] <albacker> how is it possible that when i do $.ajaxSetup({async:false}); just before a $.post(..) it works as intended (i want to return a value that i get from this post), but when i use $.ajax with async:false it doesn't work. i get no data from the server. is this normal behaviour? can i get json AND use async:false ?
[00:58:12] <henk_maaier> anyone?
[00:58:45] <RobW> henk_maaier: maybe the return is sending it like that
[00:58:56] <RobW> if it's coming from a php script, check the script.
[00:59:24] <henk_maaier> RobW: i found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1219860/javascript-jquery-html-encoding
[00:59:34] <henk_maaier> is that a proper way to go?
[01:00:07] <RobW> henk_maaier: it'll work, use the solution
[01:00:11] <coldhead> ?p @ albacker
[01:00:12] <bot-t1> albacker, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[01:00:20] <RobW> (I was just about to suggest it)
[01:00:29] <coldhead> show us the code that doesn't work as expected
[01:01:36] <gnarf> albacker: there is almost no good reason to use async: false
[01:02:05] <albacker> this doesn't work as excepted : http://pastebin.com/8VZnEqUa
[01:02:16] <coldhead> ocf: it would be good to know what problem your boss's suggestion is meant to solve
[01:02:45] <RobW> albacker: that's not how you set the options
[01:02:51] <gnarf> ocf: there is nothing called a "jquery class"
[01:03:29] <albacker> RobW, where's my error?
[01:03:40] <coldhead> oh england, my lionheart
[01:03:56] <RobW> albacker: actually.. what are you trying to accomplish..
[01:04:03] <coldhead> +1
[01:04:17] <RobW> albacker: are you wanting to return data after a call or call a function? if so, use the callback like you have .. there's not really a reason to disable async.
[01:05:00] <makinen> hwo can I get a textarea attached to the elastic jquery plugin to grow when I add text to it programmatically
[01:05:20] <RobW> albacker: and I'd probably suggest using $.get instead perhaps
[01:05:34] <makinen> $(".elastic").keypressed() doesn't trigger the plugin
[01:05:35] <gnarf> albacker: you get your head out of the async: false and use callbacks....
[01:05:37] <albacker> RobW, i did this to be more generic, since i could use this function in other places, i don't see how this can return a value using a callback value.
[01:05:49] <gnarf> albacker: you can RETURN the $.ajax in 1.5
[01:05:54] <gnarf> and attach your own success to it
[01:06:02] <gnarf> in 1.6 you can even pipe that return
[01:06:09] <coldhead> makinen: try .trigger('keydown') also keyup and change
[01:06:11] <RobW> albacker: $.get(url, function(data) { myFunction(data); }); perhaps?
[01:06:25] <RobW> you can also set the type in 3rd param
[01:06:31] <RobW> html, json, xml.. or whatnot
[01:06:54] <Patatouf> hello ! i try to use the autocomplete function function following the example http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/autocomplete#Setup (my code is here http://pastebin.com/vzNPmVq5) but it keeps looking for data and never autocompletes my field. Any idea ?
[01:06:54] <albacker> but i dont know myFunction in advance.. or lets say i know it.
[01:06:56] <gnarf> ?async
[01:06:56] <bot-t1> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user‚Äôs ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[01:07:01] <RobW> $.get(url, function(data) { functionBlah(data); }, 'json');
[01:07:01] <albacker> but i want to use data in other palces
[01:07:18] <RobW> albacker: use the callback then
[01:07:50] <RobW> and structure your json a bit better.. perhaps return a json object "doThis", then in javascript switch(data.doThis) { }
[01:08:10] <makinen> coldhead: no success :( tried to trigger all the three events
[01:08:50] <RobW> Patatouf: you're not calling to an external script
[01:09:07] <Patatouf> RobW, what do u mean ?
[01:09:44] <albacker> RobW, but if you say i should use callbacks that means that i will precise the callback function in the body of my $.get call. that is static and what i'm trying not to do. unless i pass a function-name to search_user and put the callback:function_name; is this what you mean?
[01:10:02] <Patatouf> RovW, I have the little jquery icon "loading" but nothing else happens
[01:10:13] <RobW> Patatouf: i lied, you can use data
[01:10:23] <gnarf> albacker: are you even listening to me?
[01:10:34] <gnarf> $.ajax().success(function( data ) { });
[01:10:36] <gnarf> right?
[01:10:42] <gnarf> in jquery 1.5 you can do that
[01:11:01] <gnarf> if you return $.ajax() from your search_user function
[01:11:17] <gnarf> you can do search_user(2).done(function( data ) { });
[01:11:36] <RobW> Patatouf: can you use jsfiddle.net
[01:11:40] <albacker> gnarf, i see.
[01:11:55] <albacker> so search_user should be a one-liner ? return $.ajax(....); ?
[01:12:04] <gnarf> albacker: it can be
[01:12:19] <albacker> ok, thanks. i'm trying that
[01:13:44] <gnarf> albacker: if you only want the "result"
[01:13:47] <gnarf> and you are using 1.6
[01:13:52] <gnarf> see ?deferred.pipe
[01:13:53] <bot-t1> gnarf, deferred.pipe() - Utility method to filter and/or chain Deferreds. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[01:14:00] <Patatouf> RobW, I dont understand how it works :(
[01:14:19] <Patatouf> RobW, but do you see any reason why it doesn't work ? (sorry to bother u)
[01:14:20] <gnarf> return $.ajax(...).pipe(function( data ) { return data.result ; });
[01:14:44] <coldhead> makinen: you'll have to read the source to the plugin then
[01:14:46] <coldhead> that's what i'd do
[01:14:58] <coldhead> and i'm an it professional
[01:15:38] <juha___> whoa this laptop is running google chrome 7

[01:15:42] <RobW> Patatouf: paste what you have to www.jsfiddle.net :)
[01:16:12] <Patatouf> yes i am doing that but it doesnt work. Even the icon doest appears contrary to my local test.. :(
[01:16:45] <clu3> hi all, is it possible to change the selected text to something else with jquery (or javascript at all), providing that that selected text is short enough that it's with in 1 span element

[03:02:07] <BlackAnt> wangdoo since you didnt use the submit button, nothing will be posted
[03:02:42] <BlackAnt> Aamir haha bro. Good examples. 7/10 :P
[03:03:15] <wangdoo> BlackAnt: I use ajax then why should i use submit
[03:04:39] <BlackAnt> because you're passing an ajax call

[03:08:00] <Aamir> wangdoo, BlackAnt  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/U9wpV/
[03:08:43] <BlackAnt> wangdoo doing it that way, you will have to pass parameters via the url
[03:09:06] <BlackAnt> wangdoo example
[03:09:06] <BlackAnt> $("#load_get").click(function(){
[03:09:08] <BlackAnt> $("#result")

[03:11:43] <BlackAnt> this line var xx=$(this).val();
[03:12:26] <BlackAnt> wangdoo var xx = $('id', this).val();
[03:12:29] <Aamir> wangdoo:  try yourselect.find('option:selected').val()  or .html()
[03:12:35] <Solidem> Nothing happens when I try $("#id").scrollTop();
[03:12:45] <Solidem> shouldn't jquery scroll to the top of that element?
[03:13:29] <dsdeiz> hello how do i trigger a .change() on  a checkbox unchecking it?
[03:13:36] <BlackAnt> var xx = $('#x', this).val();
[03:15:09] <dsdeiz> can't use removeAttr since it doesn't seem to trigger the change even
[03:15:11] <wangdoo> BlackAnt: Aamir  no ,it is not working.update and check with jsfiddle
[03:15:11] <dsdeiz> event*
[03:15:57] <BlackAnt> wangdoo lets see html and js code in there
[03:16:14] <BlackAnt> and php
[03:17:17] <wangdoo> BlackAnt: I have two drop down boxes.if i select one or two values it has to be passed to test.php and selected value should be shown in drop down
[03:17:43] <Aamir> wangdoo: yes it does work: http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/U9wpV/1/ :/
[03:17:51] <dsdeiz> ah, removeAttr('checked').trigger('change') seemed to do it.. dunno if it's the right way tho
[03:19:24] <wangdoo> Aamir: after selecting value from first box ,click okay.now select value from second box .alert ii not work
[03:20:28] <Aamir> wangdoo:  because you binded changed event to #x not #y
[03:20:51] <Aamir> wangdoo:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/U9wpV/2/
[03:20:51] <wangdoo> Aamir: how to get both values?
[03:21:05] <Ramosa> I have a console.log(node) that prints [ DynaTreeNode<title> ] .. 0 .. childList [ more DynaTreeNodes.. how do I select these child nodes? node.children() does not select anything.. how do I debug a selector, rather than using console.log ?
[03:21:35] <coldhead> $(node).find('*') ?
[03:21:52] <wangdoo> Aamir: not both values are y2 and y2
[03:22:11] <wangdoo> Aamir: see the alert after choosing 2nd select box
[03:22:40] <Ramosa> coldhead, that prints [ ] .. context "undefined"
[03:22:54] <Aamir> wangdoo:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/U9wpV/3/
[03:24:53] <coldhead> Ramosa: that means jQuery can't find any children
[03:24:56] <coldhead> what the hell is node?
[03:26:10] <Ramosa> coldhead, well when i console.log(node) those 2 elements are part of the node tree somehow, I just dont know how to match a selector to fetch them... they are inside "0"
[03:26:19] <wangdoo> Aamir: Thanks but let me check in my here
[03:26:50] <coldhead> Ramosa: console.log(node[0]) doesn't do what you need?
[03:27:21] <Skizu> Hey

[03:27:50] <coldhead> we love helping noobs
[03:28:02] <Skizu> Haha thanks
[03:28:04] <coldhead> it makes us all puffy down there
[03:28:15] <Skizu> ;D
[03:28:33] <Skizu> Well ye,
[03:28:45] <Skizu> Im like $('#items').add('div');
[03:28:51] <Skizu> And nothings happening at all
[03:29:05] <coldhead> ?add @ Skizu
[03:29:05] <bot-t> Skizu, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[03:29:10] <makinen> how can I remove all the td elements inside table?
[03:29:14] <coldhead> add lets you select other things from the dom
[03:29:26] <silverd> morning guys, I have a table and each row has a checkbox.  I am trying to update the row background and color when the input is checked.  Can anyone chip in and recommend the best way to go about achieve this? (please :))
[03:29:29] <coldhead> Skizu: you might want to use  ?wrap
[03:29:30] <bot-t> Skizu, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[03:29:34] <makinen> $("#foo").find('tr').remove() removed the first row only
[03:30:12] <Ramosa> coldhead, $(node)[0] removes the + on console.log.. the 2 nodes I need is in the childList of node ... but .children() returns null
[03:30:53] <Ramosa> node.0.childList[0: nodeIWant
[03:30:55] <BlackAnt> thats funny coldhead
[03:31:09] <makinen> $("#foo tr").remove() did the trick
[03:31:10] <Dabuti__> makinen: $.each('table > td', function(){ this.remove(); });
[03:31:25] <makinen> is that better than my solution?
[03:31:38] <Dabuti__> ah you want to remove tr
[03:32:13] <makinen> actually, I'm not sure. I'd want to fill the table with new data returned by an ajax query :P
[03:32:37] <Dabuti__> then just replace the content of the table
[03:32:43] <coldhead> Ramosa: as far as i know jQuery can handle XML but i've never done so sorry
[03:32:44] <Bittarman> makinen, use a tbody, and change the innerHTML with your ajax response
[03:32:52] <coldhead> it should Just Work
[03:33:12] <makinen> the query returns json dictionary of the rows
[03:33:32] <Ramosa> coldhead... doubt it's XML .. maybe it's just console.log that outputs thing funny.. What I'm looking for is a better way to debug and figure out the right selector
[03:33:42] <makinen> can I just assign the answer to the innerHTML?
[03:33:52] <Dabuti__> makinen: just read each row of the json and replace the table
[03:33:55] <Bittarman> well, just clear the tbody, and then append your new data to it by iterating over your json response
[03:34:37] <orl> Hi!

[03:37:25] <orl> I've a behaviour I can't explain with mouseleave: I'm trying to rotate and slide a div when mouseleave.
[03:37:50] <orl> when using a Timeout to do the mouseleave (http://pastebin.com/qcAUYYj3), it works properly (but is a bit nervous)
[03:38:16] <orl> when using mouseleave (http://pastebin.com/zMH0R7eA) the element begins by a rotation, and then it rotates and slides
[03:38:52] <Dabuti__> Skizu: what does that now ?
[03:38:53] <wangdoo> Aamir: are you there?
[03:38:58] <Raydiation> what can i do that that i dont jump to the top of the page when i click on a link?
[03:39:04] <Skizu> Nothing at all
[03:39:09] <Skizu> No errors
[03:39:11] <Skizu> nothing
[03:39:13] <Raydiation> i set a click method on the link to load a page with ajax
[03:39:23] <Dabuti__> $('#items').add('div').addClass('class').text(text); <-- looks like you will replace the #items div
[03:39:34] <Aamir> Raydiation:  return false; inside your .click
[03:39:49] <coldhead> Skizu: http://pastebin.com/gJrrecFH
[03:39:50] <Dabuti__> Skizu: firebug can help a lot with Ajax requests
[03:39:51] <coldhead> more like that

[03:40:11] <Skizu> Looking coldhead
[03:40:15] <coldhead> add() doesn't do what you think it does
[03:40:18] <coldhead> as i said above

[03:42:34] <Dabuti__> but guys jsfiddle > pasteX :D

[03:43:19] <Skizu> Ah i see cold
[03:43:25] <coldhead> guh i still have too much jQuery
[03:43:36] <coldhead> should be; var entry = '<div class="class">' + text + '</div>';

[03:50:55] <BlackAnt> wangdoo the script is working fine as an example. It depends how you edited it

[03:53:33] <Aamir> why $( $(node)) ?
[03:53:44] <Aamir> $(node) is enough
[03:54:19] <Ramosa> Aamir, seems not.. I'm using http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/sample-contextmenu.html
[03:54:47] <Ramosa> hmm forget that link.. I extended it with custom stuff
[03:54:59] <BlackAnt> wangdoo read this http://api.jquery.com/change/
[03:55:05] <BlackAnt> its self explanatory

[04:03:57] <BlackAnt> working 100% ok
[04:04:54] <BlackAnt> it gets whats in between <option>gets me</option> . dirty but it works
[04:05:58] <innociv> Is there something out there for how I'm supposed to shorten page links?
[04:06:29] <SpecialEmily> innociv what sort of links?
[04:06:41] <innociv> Like if you have 10 pages it'd be 1,...,8,9,10
[04:06:56] <innociv> But when you supply current position..
[04:07:20] <innociv> Kind of stupid, but it's confusing me how to concisely write this.
[04:07:47] <Ramosa> how do I check if an element is a DOM or jQuery element?
[04:08:15] <SpecialEmily> first page, (...) current page - 1, current page, current page +1, (...) last page.
[04:08:18] <simoncpu> uh
[04:08:35] <simoncpu> what jquery plugin can you guys recommend for uploadin gfiles?
[04:08:51] <simoncpu> i'm using ajaxform, but it doesn't seem to fire the callbacks
[04:08:56] <sacrebleu> ok I have the following issue:  I use jquery to get AJAX back from a php script that has (when I alert) in the data a value of "<img src='imagethatexists.jpg'>" .. but when I $("#thisdiv").html(data); the div's content is blank.
[04:08:59] <innociv> What if current page is 1? :p  When you'd have 1,2,3,...,10.  If it's 5, you'd want something like 1,...,4,5,6,...,10
[04:09:10] <innociv> Then*
[04:09:13] <SpecialEmily> plupload
[04:09:43] <innociv> If your page is distant from the first or last, it's easy.  It's just like you said.
[04:09:56] <SpecialEmily> innociv, well obviously you only display ... if current-page -1 != 1
[04:10:13] <SpecialEmily> or 2
[04:10:18] <SpecialEmily> just to make it neater
[04:10:36] <innociv> It sounds like I'm going to have a ton of if's to check edge cases both in the begining of end
[04:11:09] <SpecialEmily> 2 is a ton?
[04:11:21] <innociv> Seems like it'll be 4?
[04:11:56] <SpecialEmily> if pages > 5 { fancy ...'s } else { just show the 5 pages }
[04:12:38] <innociv> if( curPage == pages )   if( curPage == (pages -1 ) )  if( curPage == (pages - 2) )  For the high end edge case.   Need to see if current page is 2 less from the max pages or else it'll repeat 10 twice
[04:12:56] <innociv> would get something like 1,...,8,9,10,10
[04:13:14] <BlackAnt> wangdoo smoother http://jsfiddle.net/U9wpV/9/
[04:13:15] <innociv> Then the same for hte low end. 6 if statements for edge cases seems silly.
[04:14:36] <innociv> Well I can remove the first and last.  Just check distance and add ... in front or behind, and have hovering the ... show the rest of the pages.

[04:16:34] <sacrebleu> guys?
[04:16:47] <sacrebleu> http://jsfiddle.net/cGnnK/
[04:17:19] <sacrebleu> see the part where it goes $("#thumbnail").html(data);?
[04:17:30] <sacrebleu> this has the effect of blanking out the content of the div
[04:17:48] <sacrebleu> when I "alert(data);"
[04:18:02] <sacrebleu> data = "<img src='someimage.jpg'>"
[04:19:26] <innociv> Well jsfiddle isn't doing the ajax call
[04:19:36] <sacrebleu> i realize that
[04:19:44] <innociv> so I don't know
[04:19:58] <sacrebleu> well, i don't know what to say.  if I put alert(data); right after that
[04:20:03] <sacrebleu> it says what it SHOULD have as content
[04:20:05] <innociv> but why aren't you just getting the img url and doing $("#thumbnail img").attr('src', data); ?
[04:20:23] <sacrebleu> because it also returns w/h when I return the tag like that
[04:20:39] <sacrebleu> If you want I can set you up a live test case
[04:20:43] <sacrebleu> to try it on my site
[04:21:25] <innociv> go ahead
[04:22:40] <sacrebleu> innociv do you use firebug
[04:22:47] <innociv> that or chrome debugge
[04:22:48] <innociv> r
[04:22:55] <innociv> you should be using console.log not alert
[04:22:59] <sacrebleu> you may want to put a watch / breakpoint
[04:23:06] <sacrebleu> i'll pm you the credentials
[04:23:11] <innociv> eh?
[04:23:18] <innociv> Just link me to the website where the ajax works
[04:23:25] <innociv> SOP stops it on jsfiddle
[04:23:37] <sacrebleu> SOP?
[04:23:41] <innociv> This is rather stupid, but I can't find a tooltip plugin that actually works.  All the ones I've seen used fixed size of boxes and stuff
[04:23:43] <innociv> single origin point
[04:26:09] <nVeeYAM> hey there. I want to convert a variable with an integer format of 1,123.00 to a normal number (so that the outcome can be 1123). What function would be best to use to do it?
[04:28:53] <BlackAnt> nVeeYAM with what? javascript?
[04:29:24] <BlackAnt> thats a float number. try int(); in php
[04:32:18] <byteme_> anyone ever used something similar to http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/overlay/external.html
[04:32:37] <byteme_> I wanted to load google or bing maps into this modal
[04:33:33] <Raydiation> Aamir: the problem was the fade out, i fixed the jumping with defining a constant wrapper with the same height
[04:34:10] <hrwath> byteme_, try shadowbox
[04:34:39] <byteme_> thanks hrwath I'll take a look
[04:34:58] <Patatouf> hi, i am using the AutoComplete plugin. I would like to know how I should format the datas I return ?
[04:34:59] <hrwath> as far as I remember it can open iframes as well
[04:35:04] <wangdoo> BlackAnt: Select value from 1st drop down and see alert.you get value as select.it should not come
[04:35:19] <wangdoo> BlackAnt: I should get empty value
[04:35:42] <Solidem> Hi people. Is there something built in in jquery that I can use to scroll the browser window to a certain div?
[04:35:46] <BlackAnt> wangdoo that was resolved here http://jsfiddle.net/U9wpV/12/
[04:36:08] <Solidem> like <div id="content">  and once the user clicks a submit button I want to scroll up to "content" so that gets focus
[04:36:13] <BlackAnt> wangdoo you can manipulate it anyway.
[04:36:46] <Patatouf> anyone knows how to format the datas I return for the autocomplete plugin ?
[04:36:56] <byteme_> I like the flowplayer one better if I could figure it out
[04:37:03] <wangdoo> BlackAnt: why is second drop down o/p is select at first time
[04:37:24] <wangdoo> BlackAnt:If i do not select second drop down then it should be empty.
[04:40:24] <Patatouf> sorry but nobody has any idea how to format the datas I return for the autocomplete plugin ? I tried "\n" between values but it doesnt work
[04:45:46] <innociv> But yeah, I found a better way to do what I was talking about.  Subtract 2 from the current page, for loop, add a number of each int in the loop unless that loop is more or less than the edge case.  Much cleaner and I can easily change how many closeby pages it shows then.
[04:50:32] <mike__b> I've read promising stuff about jQuery UI Grid. I understand it's not complete yet, but a lot of work has been done so far. I would like to let my project use the Grid. Are there already examples for how to use it?
[04:55:00] <hongymagic> you could probably gather something about the ui-grid work in here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/grid
[04:55:32] <wangdoo> BlackAnt:are you there?
[05:04:42] <asonge> anyone ever have issues triggering an even from an event handler?
[05:09:33] <BlaDe^> Wow, I just created a test case of my bug in jsfiddle, and it doesn't bug x.x
[05:13:23] <Bartzy|work> Hi
[05:13:37] <Bartzy|work> How do I change the CSS of only one or two jquery UI buttons ? :|
[05:13:46] <Bartzy|work> how do I reference them
[05:14:25] <Cork> Bartzy|work: buttons in a dialog or what?
[05:14:56] <Bartzy|work> Cork: <input type="checkbox" id="test">    $('#test').button();
[05:15:13] <Bartzy|work> Cork: It's a checkbox button. I want to make it a bit smaller in height.
[05:15:27] <Cork> barratt: just att addClass('your-class') to $('#test')
[05:15:28] <Bartzy|work> and I noticed 'line-height' on the span that's created is what causing the big height...
[05:15:39] <Cork> run addClass
[05:15:52] <Bartzy|work> Cork: But I think it's not on the #test element.
[05:16:10] <Bartzy|work> oh, I got what you're saying.. just use CSS childs to get to my needed element
[05:16:40] <Bartzy|work> Cork: I see in Firebug that #test is not a parent of anything. the '<label>' is the parent...
[05:16:54] <Bartzy|work> Is it possible to reference the label of a 'input' (that I have the ID for) in CSS ?
[05:19:05] <Cork> Bartzy|work: lable[for="<your id>"]
[05:19:13] <Bartzy|work> thank you.
[05:20:04] <Bartzy|work> Cork: Last question: 'parent > child' -  this selector is not supported in IE6, or is it supported cause I use it in jquery and it does its magic ?
[05:20:29] <Cork> Bartzy|work: correct both times
[05:20:40] <Cork> its not supported in ie, but its supported in jquery selectors
[05:20:48] <sneak> hi guys.  i know jquery must have an internal implementation of an object->json serializer, and i wish to use it without actually making an ajax call.  how would i go about doing that?
[05:21:45] <Bartzy|work> Cork: in IE7+ it's supported right?
[05:22:01] <Tobsn> does anyone know if i can load an image and only show if the image is actually there and not 404?
[05:22:30] <Bartzy|work> I have a problem: $('#checkbox').button(); $('#checkbox').click(function() { alert("Blah"); });
[05:22:34] <Bartzy|work> Nothing happens when I click !
[05:22:46] <Bartzy|work> oh, never mind!
[05:31:10] <astn> how do i stop a parent div to trigger its onclick event when i click on a child?
[05:33:56] <Bartzy|work> How can I run a function on a set of jquery elements, sending each element to a function call as an argument ?
[05:33:58] <Bartzy|work> something like map ?
[05:34:25] <Segaja> .each()
[05:34:59] <astn> how do i stop a parent div to trigger its onclick event when i click on a child?
[05:35:49] <Cork> astn: bind click on the child and class event.stopPropagation();
[05:35:52] <orl> I get back with my mouseleave/mouseout problem. Actually, it behaves just like before it does what's in the .mouseleave() it runs what is in .hover() once again.
[05:35:58] <Cork> class=call
[05:36:00] <orl> Is that a normal behaviour?
[05:36:36] <orl> and when looking at the example given on the jQuery API page, it's all the same, as the increment is not really +1
[05:36:47] <orl> http://api.jquery.com/mouseout/
[05:37:07] <astn> can u give me an example plz?
[05:37:37] <orl> a piece of code?
[05:38:16] <astn> orl, u talking to me?
[05:38:18] <orl> the jquery script is here: http://pastebin.com/DhkSnmuq
[05:38:21] <orl> astn: yes
[05:38:28] <orl> (lately)
[05:38:47] <orl> oh sorry, I thought you were answering me
[05:38:59] <astn> o
[05:39:13] <Cradam> hi im trying to use nivo slider but it wont load http://31.222.178.89/bprint/
[05:40:21] <Cradam> anyone able to tell me what ive done wrong?
[05:42:10] <Patatouf> I am using a text field with an autocompletion. When, thanks to the autocompletion or not, I change the text of this input, it doesnt change its value. Do you have any idea why ?
[05:49:35] <Bartzy|work> How do I remove a filter that I applied in DataTables ?
[05:53:07] <Patatouf> is there anyone here to help a bit ? :(
[05:54:43] <Bittarman> Patatouf, on IRC, that question is usually ignored
[05:54:52] <Bittarman> your far better off, just asking your question
[05:54:53] <Patatouf> ok
[05:55:13] <Patatouf> let's try then : I have 2 autocomplete field
[05:55:41] <Patatouf> I want to use the value of the first one in the second one. But i dont manage to do that :(
[05:56:06] <CIDIC> I'm trying to find someone to look over my small jquery plugin. anyone interested?
[05:57:08] <CIDIC> Patatouf: what is your issue?
[05:57:21] <Patatouf> both $('#1').autocomplete() and $('#2').autocomplete() are in mu document.ready(). It seems value of #1 is loaded when I load the page and not when I try to fill #2
[05:57:59] <CIDIC> they aren't actually #1 and #2 are they? id's can't start with a number
[05:58:05] <CIDIC> I don't think
[05:58:26] <CIDIC> do you have code live somewhere that i can see it?
[05:58:44] <Patatouf> wait I copy paste it
[05:58:53] <CIDIC> use pastebin
[06:00:56] <Guest39679> hi. Is it good practise to add own custom options to jquery UI control?
[06:01:19] <Patatouf> CIDIC, here it is http://pastie.org/2101255
[06:01:55] <Patatouf> CIDIC, I can use number for ids : when I submit using onclick on a link, it works
[06:02:21] <wangdoo> how to update selected drop down box value using smarty
[06:02:53] <wangdoo> CIDIC: how to update selected drop down box value using smarty
[06:03:16] <CIDIC> Id
[06:03:23] <CIDIC> Id's can't start with a number like I said
[06:03:39] <erichynds> ?valid id
[06:03:39] <bot-t> ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[06:03:53] <CIDIC> fix that first
[06:04:00] <Patatouf> why do u say that ? my onclick button works well with the id starting with numbers
[06:04:23] <CIDIC> that is why this isn't working
[06:04:37] <CIDIC> partly
[06:04:43] <Patatouf> ok I try :)
[06:06:21] <CIDIC> this isn't all of your code is it?
[06:07:22] <Patatouf> It doesn't work either, do you want all my code ?
[06:07:28] <wangdoo> CIDIC: did u see my post
[06:08:03] <Patatouf> here it is http://pastie.org/2101276 :)
[06:08:21] <CIDIC> wangdo I don't know what smarty is
[06:08:57] <CIDIC> wangdoo:
[06:09:15] <CIDIC> Patatouf: I don't have the time to debug something this big for you sorry
[06:12:23] <wangdoo> CIDIC: how to update selected drop down box in smarty
[06:14:07] <Patatouf> CIDIC, ok... But I really think the idea is about "when the script is loaded". For example, I know they are all loaded when I load the page. They should be loaded only when I click on a field I guess
[06:16:47] <johanhar> Hi, I try to find the closest <legend>, and the first <div> with a certain class inside there again. Any tips?
[06:17:33] <johanhar> element.closest("legend").first("div").hasClass("theclass") ... hmm?
[06:18:17] <erichynds> first() doesn't take a selector
[06:18:24] <johanhar> ok
[06:18:37] <erichynds> .find('div:first')
[06:19:03] <johanhar> but then the class?
[06:19:25] <erichynds> .find('div.classname:first')
[06:19:26] <erichynds> ?
[06:19:36] <johanhar> uh oh ye, thanks :)

[06:37:24] <Patatouf> Hello. I have an autocomplete field. When I click on it and chose an option, the text inside the input field changes but the value of the field doesnt (i have an alert when the value changes and it doesnt pop). Any idea ?
[06:44:21] <BlackAnt> hiya lovers
[06:46:27] <iivvoo> shouldn't $("#whatever").val() if id="whatever" is a text input give me its entered value?
[06:48:44] <kojiro> what's the best way to check if a given URL exists (returns a usable HTTP response like 200,301,302)? Are there any XHR shortcuts for this?
[06:48:54] <kojiro> I don't need any info from the response other than "this exists"
[06:50:33] <Patatouf> does someone know how to format datas provided by requesting the url in the  autocomplete plugin ?
[06:52:13] <kojiro> Nevermind, I got it
[06:54:27] <innociv> http://pastebin.com/8uVmSZiH I'm doing an ajax load, and then this function call "forum.writePost()".  The problem is, I need what writePost does to happen after the board.loadPage() that does the ajax call.
[06:54:48] <innociv> Can I have like a callback added to board.loadPage(); to fire a function when the ajax finishes?  How would I make a callback?
[06:55:28] <innociv> so I could like board.loadPage(page, forum.writePost(board.data.id));
[06:56:38] <Patatouf> does someone know how to format datas provided by requesting the url in the  autocomplete plugin ?
[07:04:32] <BlackAnt> AcTiVaTe is a good name
[07:05:45] <toxz> can i get the vertical slide effect like slideToogle() for hide() and show()
[07:05:46] <toxz> ?
[07:05:57] <SpecialEmily> toggleHide ?
[07:06:02] <SpecialEmily> or showToggle
[07:06:05] <SpecialEmily> or something like thaty
[07:06:09] <SpecialEmily> perhaps its just toggle
[07:06:16] <SpecialEmily> there is on, I don't recall what its called though
[07:07:14] <toxz> toggle exists - but thats toggle and not show and hide :-(
[07:07:30] <toxz> and it has the same slide effect like show and hide
[07:07:46] <toxz> slideToogle has this vertical effect
[07:10:04] <Patatouf> sorry to bother you again but I still cant succeed with my problem :( I am using the autocomplete plugin. Loading the datas with the url works. My problem is that choosing an option, doesnt change the value ?!
[07:12:22] <Aamir> SpecialEmily, toxz  try .animate({height: 0 / 200} , 1000)
[07:14:03] <BlackAnt> hmm...

[07:18:53] <electronplusplus> how can I make it work?
[07:18:56] <nVeeYAM> Can someone perhaps explain to me how I can get an attr() value of an html element which is in a different data field, but same row, as the element I am working from?
[07:19:28] <BlackAnt> nVeeYAM I went for a break
[07:19:38] <nVeeYAM> so I have 3 datafields, I need to get an attr() from a <td> which is not the one I am working from
[07:19:50] <nVeeYAM> BlackAnt: sure, hope you're back to work now
[07:20:35] <BlackAnt> nVeeYAM http://phpjs.org/functions/str_replace:527 too many examples for the str_replace() in jquery. can be used to replaced foat numbers and return an int
[07:21:04] <duntz> can anyone help me out with a quick question about plugin namespacing
[07:21:10] <nVeeYAM> i was under the impression I am asking a different question :P
[07:21:40] <BlackAnt> nVeeYAM to get the field of the clickable attribute , use $('ab', this).val();
[07:22:21] <BlackAnt> ?namespace
[07:22:23] <bot-t> BlackAnt, event.namespace - The namespace specified when the event was triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.namespace/
[07:22:36] <BlackAnt> duntz whats ?namespace
[07:23:44] <duntz> i meant namespacing with regard to organizing my plugin
[07:23:46] <cjm> can someone tell me why this erases the starting css properties? http://jsfiddle.net/MeqVZ/5/
[07:23:55] <BlackAnt> this is not a right. Its just a privilledge . Think again
[07:24:24] <BlackAnt> duntz http://api.jquery.com/event.namespace/
[07:24:31] <johanhar> I cant seem to bind the change event to a div. I want to check when children are "taken out", and set display:none if no childen (empty)
[07:24:35] <johanhar> Any ideas?
[07:24:45] <SEJeff> I'm trying to use $.post(url, { key1: value, key2: [array, value]}, function(data) { console.log...}); Somehow, key2 is being posted as key2[] = [array, value]
[07:26:18] <nVeeYAM> BlackAnt: http://pastebin.com/8XEcp6nk
[07:26:21] <nVeeYAM> that is the link
[07:26:22] <nVeeYAM> sorry
[07:26:26] <nVeeYAM> let me rather explain like that
[07:26:43] <nVeeYAM> I need to get the name attribute value from a different td link in the same table row
[07:26:47] <nVeeYAM> if this makes sense
[07:27:04] <nVeeYAM> I am just not sure how do I walk the dom in jquery (or javascript :/ )
[07:27:30] <cjm> can someone tell me why this erases the starting css properties before the transition?? http://jsfiddle.net/MeqVZ/6/
[07:27:39] <SEJeff> This is the problem: http://pastebin.com/x8Ld4rcS
[07:27:44] <duntz> try .parent(), and children()
[07:27:53] <SEJeff> "devices" is being posted as devices[]
[07:27:55] <duntz> nVee
[07:28:24] <BlackAnt> nVeeYAM you need to get text between the <Td> tags?
[07:29:20] <nVeeYAM> BlackAnt: I need to get the attr value of the first td
[07:29:28] <nVeeYAM> duntz: let me have a look quick
[07:29:46] <DaIRC43616> I know this is probably a stupid example, but I was looking at the methods of using .ajaxStart() to show a loading GIF, is there anyway to return a message back during each load, without having to have separate calls for each action ?
[07:30:00] <DaIRC43616> such as... "Doing This..." "Now Doing That..." but still on the same request?
[07:30:45] <BlackAnt> nVeeYAM <td name="sss" id="sss"></td> var whatsTd = $('#sss').attr('name');
[07:30:55] <BlackAnt> nVeeYAM <td name="sss" id="sss"></td> var whatsTd = $('#sss').attr('id');
[07:31:09] <seutje> bot-t: tell matjas yea... I'ma be late...
[07:31:09] <bot-t> seutje, Okay.
[07:32:21] <duntz> ok you can $td.parent().children(":first") nvee, i think
[07:32:30] <EugenA> i'm getting json, how can i output the value of first key?
[07:32:41] <BlackAnt> duntz calling a child that way wont work on ie5
[07:32:48] <BlackAnt> duntz calling a child that way wont work on ie6 rather
[07:33:05] <EugenA> $.each(data, function(key, val) {alert (val);});   ?
[07:33:18] <BlackAnt> duntz perhaps look for ie8.js on google codes
[07:37:02] <Z3R0> anyone?
[07:38:16] <BlackAnt> anyone looking at you ?
[07:40:42] <nVeeYAM> okay BlackAnt
[07:40:52] <nVeeYAM> so if i understand you correctly I need to give each td an id then?
[07:40:58] <nVeeYAM> and work off that?
[07:41:37] <BlackAnt> nVeeYAM yep.
[07:45:28] <trumpetmic> good morning
[07:45:41] <BlackAnt> nVeeYAM leme see if U can show you a working example on jsfriddle
[07:50:22] <electronplusplus> Jquery works really bad in IE
[07:50:33] <Lee_msi> learn to code properly then
[07:50:42] <Lee_msi> ive had things working fine from IE6 to 9
[07:50:45] <BlackAnt> yeah learn to code properly lol

How could I add a callback in that fuciton so I could do something  like board.loadPage(page, forum.writePost(board.data.id));?
[08:01:03] <outer_space> in jquery layout, how do you make the center-pane fill up the center space?
[08:01:17] <outer_space> height: 100% makes it overflow and cover up the south-pane
[08:02:04] <outer_space> and its not right when I add a resize function and calculate height = height of body minus height of north minus height of south

[08:21:28] <rhodee> need help with following: using jquery to make modal window  and the click event does not fire - http://jsfiddle.net/PpUvj/
[08:22:34] <thin> bot-t & djquery: that doesn't seem to have the 1 option i want
[08:22:57] <djquery> thin: look at the collapsible option
[08:23:00] <thin> an option to not have all other sections auto-close when i click on a header
[08:23:18] <thin> that's not it, that allows me to close all sections and only see headers
[08:23:22] <djquery> set it to true
[08:23:33] <thin> what I need is the ability to open more than 2 or 3 sections simultaneously
[08:24:00] <thin> (have them open so i can see related data at the same time not necessarily animate simultaneously)
[08:24:25] <djquery> thin: no to have them all collapsed you have to do .accordion({active: -1});
[08:24:38] <Patatouf> djquery, i would be very very pleased if you could help me or give me an advice when you have finished with thun
[08:24:42] <thin> I don't want them all collapsed. I want them all Open
[08:25:10] <djquery> thin: that's a little harder but, should be able to be done.
[08:25:24] <sontek> Is there a way to snag up the window id of a target="_blank" so that I can change its location after they click?
[08:25:26] <thin> or more than 1 open (ie: sections A, D, & F)
[08:25:45] <djquery> thin: just set collapsible to true then loop over all the headers and trigger click
[08:26:03] <sontek> I'm creating a preview link, which needs to submit the db data and then change the dialog of the preview window so it'll refresh the data
[08:26:29] <thin> that will open all at the same time, I want the user to choose the 2 or 3 sections they need open and open them and close them as needed

[08:28:00] <dtach> Hi, could anyone tell me why my or statements arent working http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/bqT4r/1/
[08:28:45] <djquery> cjm: not very good with animatin colors but the jqueryui extends the .animate to work with animating colors.  see ?ui.color
[08:28:45] <bot-t> cjm, #3440 (ui color picker) ñ jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 3 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3440
[08:29:02] <djquery> ok try see ?ui.animate
[08:29:02] <bot-t> The jQuery UI effects core extends the¬†animate¬†function to be able to animate colors as well. http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/
[08:29:31] <thin> djquery: can you give a rough idea of how long it _might_ take to tweak the existing accordion ui to do this? I ask because the site's currently all Prototype.js and I can only justify switching everthing to jquery if we're sure we can get the functionality we need quickly.
[08:29:47] <thin> because the rest of the time will be spent porting prototype code to jquery
[08:30:05] <djquery> 5 secs
[08:30:17] <cjm> bot-t, djquery, I was hoping to rely on css transitions? no can do?
[08:30:17] <bot-t> cjm, Most likely.
[08:30:33] <djquery> you dont have to spend any time doing just take one of the demos off the jquery ui site and copy\paste
[08:30:44] <thin> we need both default accordion ui behaviour (which prototype lacks) but also the other accordion behavour which we hackily created in prototype and isn't very reusable

[08:40:24] <DJTrey1> I'm using jquery datepicker and trying to check if the selected date is past 90 days. Can someone help me please? http://jsfiddle.net/MTxbn/
[08:40:28] <ian___> dtach: do you intend the if statement evaluation to come down into the else clause?
[08:41:04] <ian___> i.e. should nowplaying be on "mainpage" instead of "single page"?
[08:41:05] <dtach> yes, thats if it did not equal any of the conditions
[08:41:09] <dtach> yes
[08:41:21] <necromancer> DJTrey1: "if (checkDate > 90 days) { alert('Date is past 90 days'); }"
[08:41:23] <dtach> but i rather not flip the if and else things
[08:41:25] <necromancer> what do you think this is, ruby? ;)(
[08:41:31] <dtach> because this is a simplified version of my cod
[08:41:33] <dtach> code
[08:41:35] <rhodee> Click event does not fire on css/jquery modal window. Where did I screw up? - http://jsfiddle.net/PpUvj/ . Note: The modal window appears correctly in browser, but does not run the script.
[08:41:47] <necromancer> DJTrey1: or is that just pseudocode
[08:41:53] <dtach> and im just confused why it wont work
[08:41:55] <DJTrey1> necromancer: if ruby is that easy....i need to start it then
[08:42:05] <djquery> DJTrey1: is this better? http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/bqT4r/2/
[08:43:02] <necromancer> DJTrey1: it pretty much is.. http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-1.html
[08:43:07] <BlackAnt> luke-- http://jsfiddle.net/553ma/3/
[08:43:22] <DJTrey1> necromancer: so can you help me please?
[08:43:48] <BlackAnt> ?struct
[08:43:51] <bot-t> BlackAnt, struct | jQuery Plugins - buzzmap lets you draw a Mindmap automatically from a given HTML list. Let your users explore it as if it was floating in water. It is also fully editable through the user interface in edit mode. http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/struct
[08:43:58] <luke--> BlackAnt: sure you wanted to ping me?
[08:44:12] <necromancer> DJTrey1: this is how you manage dates in JS: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[08:44:30] <djquery> DJTrey1: this is better http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/bqT4r/3/
[08:44:30] <necromancer> so from there you can find out exactly what time/date it is so you have a baseline
[08:44:45] <BlackAnt> luke-- ask whats jsfriddle.
[08:44:49] <ian___> dtach: it  doesn't work how you expect because if any of the OR'd evaluations are true, the if (...) will evaluate as true and you will get single page.  In your example, the first part in the if is cID != ''
[08:45:03] <luke--> BlackAnt: what? no
[08:45:06] <DJTrey1> djquery: i think you're messaging the wrong person. or either giving me the wrong link
[08:45:13] <necromancer> DJTrey1: and then there's https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse, which will parse the date string generated by datePicker. it will generate a long string that's the amount of milliseconds between now and 1/1/1970
[08:45:29] <djquery> probably
[08:45:31] <necromancer> but so will the Date class, so you can just do a simple number comparison to find out the difference
[08:45:35] <BlackAnt> luke-- I just gave u a working example I made to print all nodes and children http://jsfiddle.net/553ma/3/
[08:45:40] <Solow> I want to catch a blur event, unless the focus is on a specific element. How would I accomplish this?
[08:45:40] <ian___> dtach: and since cID == 'nowplaying', (cID != '') evaluates as true, so you'll drop into the if.
[08:45:55] <djquery> dtach: http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/bqT4r/3/
[08:46:03] <luke--> BlackAnt: I never asked for anything like that, you must mistake me
[08:46:49] <BlackAnt> sorry
[08:47:28] <dtach> ian__ djquery thank you both this will work out!
[08:49:00] <BlackAnt> :D
[08:49:17] <thin> It just dawned on me that my desire might already exist as something not named "accordion".
[08:49:29] <thin> "accordion" implies a certain expected behaviour
[08:49:46] <thin> does jquery have some kind of non-accordion expandable, collapsible menu ui?
[08:49:52] <necromancer> DJTrey1: so what you want to do is find the current Date (var now = new Date(); now.UTC()) and find the UTC of the date given in datePicker (var given = new Date($('#txtField').val()) and compare the given date with now + 90 days in ms (google says it's 7776000000 ms), and you got yourself a comparison
[08:50:34] <DJTrey1> necromancer: ok let me try that
[08:51:31] <salazr> hey.. can someone point me in the right direction here? maybe i'm thinking about this all wrong. using jquery ui Tabs, need to trigger custom event for a specific tab.. or hijack the tab event on a function and then let it continue.. thoughts?
[08:55:06] <trumpetmic> good morning
[08:55:58] <Z3R0> I know this code is horrendous, but it gives an example of what I am trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/kz7Bv/
[08:56:23] <Z3R0> Basically, use the ajax (loading.gif) during processing, but display a message for each type of process that is happening
[08:57:39] <DJTrey1> necromancer: hrmmm nothing - http://jsfiddle.net/MTxbn/2/
[08:58:03] <DJTrey1> necromancer: for instance if you put 09/25/2011 in the text field it should give you the alert()
[08:59:04] <salazr> @salazr nevermind.. successssss with bind()
[08:59:26] <necromancer> DJTrey1: do you know much about programming? there's quite an obvious error there :)
[09:00:09] <DJTrey1> wrap 7776000000 in single quotes?
[09:00:11] <necromancer> DJTrey1: also, you should use jQuery's .click() action to bind a click event, not onclick="" in the HTML
[09:00:26] <necromancer> DJTrey1: that would make it a String, you don't want that because you're making a numerical comparison
[09:00:40] <necromancer> DJTrey1: what does 'currentDate.UTC();' do?
[09:00:46] <necromancer> and where is it's value? how can you find it?
[09:01:10] <BlackAnt> time zone
[09:01:32] <BlackAnt> returns date in that time zone.
[09:01:32] <necromancer> BlackAnt: it's a rhetorical question :)
[09:01:56] <necromancer> DJTrey1: currentDate.UTC() is returning a value but you're not setting it into a variable
[09:02:06] <necromancer> so there's no way for you to call that value after that statement
[09:02:58] <necromancer> what you need to do is either create a variable or just execute currentDate.UTC() in the if statement
[09:03:00] <necromancer> i'll show you
[09:03:00] <blackthorne> how can I catch the double click event
[09:03:29] <Z3R0> anyone get what I am trying to do here? and maybe show me a method of doing what I am looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/kz7Bv/
[09:03:51] <DJTrey1> necromancer: ok
[09:04:38] <Z3R0> itw works the way I have it, but I have to create multiple posts for each event, even if the event could happen in a single request... in order to display what is going on...
[09:05:13] <thin> anyone have a good example of a site that's currently entirely flash but could have been entirely jquery?
[09:07:05] <pissypaw> sup
[09:07:15] <BlackAnt> thin unless it can't make the motion tween smooth
[09:07:55] <thin> nah I mean a textbook example of "why the hell was this done in flash? None of this NEEDS flash".
[09:08:29] <BlackAnt> preferrable language dude
[09:08:30] <necromancer> DJTrey1: hey i actually don't have time to show you i gotta run to a meeting. but look up the Date object and specifically the UTC property. also use your Firebug console to test out shit before you implement it
[09:08:55] <ian___> thin: http://www.optimum7.com/css3-man/animation.html
[09:09:04] <smplstk> thin: just go to like fwa and see what's there
[09:09:16] <smplstk> thin: even thefwa site itself is a good example
[09:09:49] <outer_space> I am using jquery to build an offline app, how do you use a html file chooser and get that file into javascript instead of uploading it to a website?
[09:09:53] <ian___> thin: it's been around for a while but it stuck in my memory
[09:10:23] <necromancer> thin: http://www.dakassociates.com/
[09:10:48] <BlackAnt> hahahaa
[09:10:51] <necromancer> thin: we did that in flash a long time before i worked here
[09:11:38] <Gerry> I have a simple question regarding jquery templates; how can you make a sum of the data passed to your template in the template itself?
[09:11:41] <mdpatrick> I'm confused by the difference between "this" and "$(this)"
[09:11:51] <necromancer> thin: the only reason it's not in JS+HTML now is because <canvas> isn't available for all browsers
[09:12:10] <mdpatrick> I'm pretty sure it's because I don't have a good enough background in javascript before jumping into jquery, but anyone mind pointing me to an article that could help me learn the distinction somehow?
[09:12:14] <necromancer> mdpatrick: you do understand that `this` is part of pure javascript, right?
[09:12:48] <thin> eeek, no, I can't show her that, necro, she loves swipes and transitions, she'll start leaning towards flash if she saw that
[09:12:49] <mdpatrick> necromancer: Yes
[09:13:03] <d3str0y> I am using jquery/ajax to load in content but everytime you click the link it will make the page jump back up to the top is there any way to prevent that?
[09:13:19] <necromancer> thin: you can do it in javascript though.. :)
[09:13:57] <Bodu> d3str0y: event.preventDefault(); ?
[09:14:13] <Bodu> d3str0y: hast the link href="#" ?
[09:14:21] <necromancer> mdpatrick: $(this) is most commonly used to reference the jQuery object of whatever you're in a callback function of (for me it's usually an event listener or an each loop)
[09:14:25] <BlackAnt> They are stuff that's better done in flash and vise versa. Its just like using explosives to make hotdog
[09:14:53] <d3str0y> me links look like href="./winners/name.html"
[09:15:35] <Bodu> d3str0y: browser?
[09:15:38] <d3str0y> I actually followed this almost to a T: http://balupton.com/sandbox/jquery-ajaxy/demo/
[09:15:56] <necromancer> BlackAnt: you have to weigh your options...is that "cool" transition really worth 30% of your market share? because iPhone/iPad users won't even be able to see your site much less use it
[09:16:00] <d3str0y> and the thing is, the back and forwards button works for me but if I type in the url it wont go to that content
[09:16:10] <d3str0y> using Firefox 4
[09:16:27] <d3str0y> err firefox 3.6 I mean
[09:16:27] <BlackAnt> necromancer I have my own ways of taking care of that when it comes handy
[09:16:37] <necromancer> BlackAnt: besides multiple file uploading, streaming/asynchronous communication, or video players, there's no real reason for flash imo
[09:16:50] <d3str0y> I noticed with that Ajaxy demo when you click on the links the page stays where its at
[09:17:01] <necromancer> mdpatrick: `this` is normally used in plugins, it references the object that the plugin was called on. i normally bind it to var self = this;
[09:17:12] <d3str0y> i'm not sure why my page works so differently =)
[09:17:21] <Bodu> d3str0y: sorry cant help without seein code
[09:17:24] <BlackAnt> necromancer I wont even use flash for multiple file upload. Thats pretty easy now in javascript libraries and a php class
[09:17:28] <mdpatrick> necromancer: I'm using an each loop, actually. That's part of where my confusion is. In the examples I'm seeing I'm having a hard time differentiating when I should be using 'this' and $(this). I can see it clearly gives me a very different set of methods.
[09:17:45] <mdpatrick> http://grasshopperpebbles.com/ajax/jquery-each/
[09:17:49] <d3str0y> I have the exact same code as on that Ajaxy demo
[09:18:00] <d3str0y> ill try out the preventDefault thing though thanks
[09:18:03] <BlackAnt> There is reason for flash in some many situations @ necromancer
[09:18:10] <necromancer> mdpatrick: i usually try to avoid using $(this) in each loops, because it gets confusing. it's just as easy to specify (i, currentElement) as args in your .each function and just reference that with currentElement
[09:18:31] <necromancer> BlackAnt: you can't do multiple file upload and uploading large files without a SWF. period.
[09:19:12] <BlackAnt> javascript is just a client side stuff. You can't accomplish stuff like a video chat using javascript. I do love JS. But when I want to get dirty with a video chat stuff, I use action script.
[09:19:23] <BlackAnt> and php acting as the middle man.
[09:19:37] <BlackAnt> necromancer I can.
[09:19:44] <necromancer> you can't, actually
[09:19:52] <necromancer> go try and upload a 5GB file to your server using JUST HTTP
[09:19:54] <BlackAnt> necromancer why?
[09:19:58] <necromancer> max file upload
[09:20:01] <necromancer> server timeout
[09:20:12] <BlackAnt> is that what fileservers use?
[09:20:14] <BlackAnt> lol.
[09:20:17] <necromancer> you'll reach the timeout before your file transfers, or you'll reach the max file upload
[09:20:20] <necromancer> no but it's what HTTP servers use
[09:20:23] <BlackAnt> like filesonic for example
[09:20:25] <necromancer> and you're uploading to an HTTP server, aren't you?
[09:20:33] <necromancer> that's very different, we're not talking about 3rd-party services
[09:20:42] <BlackAnt> its 101% possible
[09:20:44] <Michael> Doesn't Apache do FTP?
[09:20:47] <necromancer> like if you wanted to upload to S3 for example
[09:20:50] <necromancer> amazon S3
[09:20:56] <BlackAnt> Pay me for the Job, I will get it done
[09:21:03] <necromancer> haha i'll pay you after you get it done
[09:21:06] <necromancer> which will be never
[09:21:08] <BlackAnt> uaha
[09:21:21] <d3str0y> pay me in gold and cigarettes
[09:22:02] <BlackAnt> why struggle , why cudgel my brain when Im not sure the pay is ready

[09:22:26] <necromancer> :)
[09:22:32] <BlackAnt> how can u tell that?
[09:22:34] <necromancer> and i got paid to research non-flash ways of doing it
[09:22:54] <necromancer> because we're very much into cross-browser compatibility here and we'd like it if our S3 uploader was available on mobile devices as well as browsers
[09:22:55] <BlackAnt> dude thats very easy. It's not even worth my time arguing about it
[09:23:24] <BlackAnt> It's not an easy thing though. But things become very easy when You know how
[09:23:52] <necromancer> lol shut up
[09:24:03] <d3str0y> necromancer
[09:24:09] <necromancer> [12:22 PM] <BlackAnt> dude thats very easy. It's not even worth my time arguing about it [12:23 PM] <BlackAnt> It's not an easy thing though.
[09:24:09] <d3str0y> do not insult the black ant for he is wise
[09:24:17] <necromancer> haha
[09:24:36] <necromancer> yeah he's wise at bullshitting people
[09:24:45] <d3str0y> it's not easy being cheesy son

[09:27:17] <anniex> hi
[09:27:26] * trumpetmic tried button.ui-state-default, but that's being over-ridden

[09:28:11] <anniex> inpvt
[09:28:16] <anniex> :)
[09:28:36] <BlackAnt> are there any restrictions?
[09:28:46] <anniex> got a question
[09:28:49] <BlackAnt> my pm is not password protected though
[09:28:59] <anniex> lol
[09:29:08] <anniex> i see
[09:29:20] <ThiefMaster|work> is it possible to restrict two connected sortables so certain elements cannot be moved to a certain container
[09:32:09] <d3str0y> blowfish
[09:39:41] <shesek> ThiefMaster|work, accepts: ':not(...)' ?
[09:40:28] <coachz> my line 30 has a .click listener on it,  when i click on it, how can i get the value in the td on line 24 please ?   I tried this but no luck:   var test = $(this).parent('tr').prev('tr').children('.body').val();     https://gist.github.com/05842b7c9357263287a3
[09:40:36] <blackthorne> hi
[09:41:02] <ThiefMaster|work> shesek: sortable doesn't have this option
[09:41:06] <blackthorne> I have an URL. How can I make a get request to that URL from jquery?
[09:41:09] <ThiefMaster|work> otherwise it would be perfect
[09:41:34] <shesek> blackthorne, $.get(url) ?
[09:41:44] <shesek> ThiefMaster|work, /me checking
[09:42:18] <ThiefMaster|work> http://jsfiddle.net/ThiefMaster/ksPpp/ is what i currently have - but that's well.. not really nice since it simply cancels the dragging instead of just disallowing to drop
[09:42:53] <mdpatrick> Is it possible to use jquery methods on an object I fetched with regular javascript i.e. getElementById
[09:42:55] <mdpatrick> necr
[09:42:57] <mdpatrick> necromancer
[09:43:17] <shesek> ThiefMaster|work, Does the items option apply to elements from connectWith ?
[09:43:25] <coachz> anyone good at jquery dom navigation please ?
[09:44:03] <shesek> coachz, just ask the question
[09:44:18] <coachz> i did,   my line 30 has a .click listener on it,  when i click on it, how can i get the value in the td on line 24 please ?   I tried this but no luck:   var test = $(this).parent('tr').prev('tr').children('.body').val();     https://gist.github.com/05842b7c9357263287a3
[09:44:34] <coachz> thanks for any help
[09:45:08] <DJTrey1> necromancer: i still can't get it into UTC - http://jsfiddle.net/MTxbn/3/
[09:45:24] <ThiefMaster|work> shesek: i want all items to be sortable. just not all items to be able to moved to another sortable-object
[09:45:43] <ThiefMaster|work> (the same item can be in both tables, in this case it may be moved in its table but not to the other table)
[09:46:43] <coachz> i'm sure it's easy to navigate the dom with jquery but i'm just not having luck
[09:46:52] <coachz> i must be missing something simple
[09:47:19] <shesek> ThiefMaster|work, yeah, I got that, but you could do something like $('#sortable1').sortable({connectWith: '#sortable2', items: 'tr:not(#sortable2 tr.same_sortable_only)'}); $('#sortable2').sortable({connectWith: '#sortable1', items: 'tr:not(#sortable1 tr.same_sortable_only)'});
[09:47:33] <SpinachHead> any recommendations for validation on multi national dates inputs?
[09:47:50] <necromancer> mdpatrick: yes?
[09:48:29] <necromancer> DJTrey1: sendDate isn't a Date, it's a jQuery object.
[09:48:30] <coachz> i'm stuck
[09:48:58] <lowrisk> coachz, you should be able to access it just by $(".body"), afaik
[09:49:16] <coachz> no because there are multiple <td> with class body
[09:49:21] <coachz> so i need the previous one only
[09:49:46] <lowrisk> and you're looking to access the previous one when it gets clicked?
[09:50:10] <lowrisk> previous <td>, that is
[09:50:12] <coachz> trying to do this,  see code at end  my line 30 has a .click listener on it,  when i click on it, how can i get the value in the td on line 24 please ?   I tried this but no luck:   var test = $(this).parent('tr').prev('tr').children('.body').val();     https://gist.github.com/05842b7c9357263287a3
[09:51:46] <lowrisk> my second impulse is that $(this) isn't giving you what you're expecting
[09:51:53] <coachz> it is
[09:52:01] <coachz> i can get values from that row no problem
[09:52:11] <coachz> from that td rather
[09:52:25] <lowrisk> hmm
[09:53:24] <coachz> in my replythread image i can get the img attribs with this just fine:     var e_discussid =  $(this).attr('data_e_discussid');
[09:54:05] <lowrisk> i guess the next thing would be to just go through each part in the chain and see what they're returning
[09:54:34] <coachz> so what should    $(this).parent('tr')   return ?
[09:54:45] <coachz> or do i need val on it
[09:55:32] <coachz> var test = $(this).parent('tr').val();   gives undefined
[09:55:44] <lowrisk> I don't think you need val
[09:55:48] <shesek> ThiefMaster|work, seems to work fine on the receive event, http://jsfiddle.net/kNAts/
[09:55:51] <lowrisk> based on what i'm reading in the API
[09:55:57] <shesek> coachz, <tr> elements don't have a value
[09:56:07] <lowrisk> OH
[09:56:21] <coachz> without val i get  [object Object]
[09:56:33] <lowrisk> try $(this).parent().get(0)
[09:57:09] <coachz> returns  [object HTMLTableCellElement]
[09:57:09] <shesek> coachz, well, obviously. What exactly are you trying to access?
[09:57:19] <shesek> Its text contents?
[09:57:27] <coachz> yes
[09:57:45] <coachz> shesek, of the <td> above with body class
[09:57:46] <larzen-wrk> I have a bit of newb question.. i have an object. var oTableTools = new TableTools(oTable, {  ... and it apparently has this property... oTableTools.dom.container
[09:57:47] <shesek> than just use text()
[09:57:56] <necromancer> DJTrey1: http://jsfiddle.net/MTxbn/3/
[09:57:57] <coachz> i don't have the element yet
[09:58:00] <blackthorne> shesek: thank you, maybe I explained myself wrong. I have URL for a file, and I want to start downloading it from a jQuery command
[09:58:02] <necromancer> there you go :)
[09:58:05] <larzen-wrk> i want to append a style (float:right) directly to oTableTools.dom.container ---> how do I do that?
[09:58:09] <coachz> shesek,   trying to do this,  see code at end  my line 30 has a .click listener on it,  when i click on it, how can i get the value in the td on line 24 please ?   I tried this but no luck:   var test = $(this).parent('tr').prev('tr').children('.body').val();     https://gist.github.com/05842b7c9357263287a3
[09:58:10] <Bodu> is it important to load jquery code sometimes at the end of html before </body>?
[09:58:30] <shesek> blackthorne, a downloadable file? just document.location = new url
[09:58:35] <necromancer> DJTrey1: you need to get the Date from a dateString, then you need to parse UTC and multiply them both by -1 (since they're both neg numbers), THEN you can compare
[09:58:39] <feathersanddown> is there an automatic way to fill a dropdown list using only key and value data and not the whole html tags ?
[09:58:41] <necromancer> Dates in JS are a little complicated
[09:58:50] <shesek> coachz, <shesek> than just use text() <shesek> coachz, <tr> elements don't have a value
[09:58:58] <necromancer> Bodu: $(document).ready does the same thing
[09:59:00] <blackthorne> shesek: but isn't it possible to start the download without leaving the current page?
[09:59:04] <coachz> shesek,  look at my code
[09:59:08] <shesek> larzen-wrk, hmm... I would ask whoever wrote that
[09:59:19] <necromancer> Bodu: putting JS code inline at the end of the page is a "natural" DOM ready
[09:59:23] <shesek> blackthorne, it won't leave the current page
[09:59:40] <shesek> as long as the response headers indicate that its a downloadable file, the browser will just download it without navigating away
[10:00:37] <necromancer> Bodu: the reason why people use .ready() is so they can put that JS in an external file. inline JS goes against the principle of separating code/actions and markup/views
[10:00:45] <necromancer> s/actions/controllers
[10:01:04] <lowrisk> coachz, have you tried the .parent().get(0).prev('tr') ?
[10:02:09] <coachz> that returns    Object #<HTMLTableCellElement> has no method 'prev'
[10:02:35] <shesek> lowrisk, I think you meant .eq(0)? which doesn't make much sense there either
[10:02:41] <coachz> since i have <tr><td></td>.....<td class="body"></td></tr>     <tr><td><img.......></td></tr>   i need a way to go up from the img click to get to the value of the td with class body
[10:02:57] <coachz> shesek, did you look at my code ?
[10:03:04] <shesek> no, I didn't
[10:03:08] <coachz> would you please ?
[10:03:17] <coachz> https://gist.github.com/05842b7c9357263287a3
[10:03:26] <shesek> Can you paste it to jsfiddle with the actual HTML output instead of the PHP code that generates it ?
[10:03:58] <coachz> no jsfiddle is like building the site from scratch
[10:04:06] <coachz> it's  a ton of work for an easy question
[10:04:06] <larzen-wrk> alright... so how would I set a css property on an element - dynamically with jQuery ?
[10:04:12] <shesek> just paste the relevant parts
[10:04:26] <shesek> just the HTML of the table and minimal javascript to demonstrate what you're trying to do
[10:04:26] <coachz> please just look at my code, it should be very obvious
[10:04:27] <BlackAnt> jsfiddle is like showing a quick demo
[10:05:14] <coachz> yeah it's overkill for this question though
[10:05:14] <shesek> coachz, I'm too much into other stuff to dig into that. A page that actually shows the HTML and what doesn't work would make it much easier for me.
[10:05:24] <coachz> dig in ?  it's 2 lines to look at
[10:05:40] <coachz>  my line 30 has a .click listener on it,  when i click on it, how can i get the value in the td on line 24
[10:05:59] <coachz> i really need to make a jsfiddle for that ?   really ?
[10:06:09] <blackthorne> shesek: with document.location = url it changes the url but with = new url, nothing happens..
[10:06:10] <shesek> okay, okay... hold on
[10:06:28] <coachz> i do need to get better with jsfiddle
[10:06:32] <coachz> i'll try that too
[10:06:56] <shesek> $(this).closest('tr').prev().find('td.body')
[10:07:34] <coachz> returns [object Object]
[10:07:41] <shesek> Well, it is an object
[10:07:47] <coachz> i need the text in it
[10:07:52] <lowrisk> .text
[10:07:53] <shesek> What are you trying to get exactly? If its the text content,
[10:08:04] <shesek> <shesek> coachz, <shesek> than just use text() <shesek> coachz, <tr> elements don't have a value
[10:08:21] <bubbafoley> coachz, did you try parents() instead of parent()?
[10:08:25] <larzen-wrk> $('#exportToolBarContainer').get(0).css({ "float": "right" }); <-- doesnt seem to work? anyone?
[10:08:40] <coachz> .text returned a jquery function it appears
[10:08:41] <shesek> larionov, why are you calling get(0) ?
[10:08:55] <necromancer> larzen-wrk: does $('#exportToolBarContainer').get(0) return a valid DOM element?
[10:09:01] <coachz> var test =   $(this).closest('tr').prev().find('td.body').text;
[10:09:07] <shesek> coachz, text is a function
[10:09:09] <necromancer> coachz: text()
[10:09:11] <shesek> text(), not text
[10:09:12] <coachz> sorry
[10:09:32] <shesek> larzen-wrk, if you're trying to narrow it down to the first matched item, use eq(0) (which doesn't make much sense, because IDs should be unique)
[10:09:33] <coachz> success
[10:09:40] <coachz> thanks shesek  !
[10:09:47] <shesek> coachz, you welcome
[10:10:03] <coachz> i'll try to find more docs to educate me on jquery dom
[10:10:09] <shesek> larzen-wrk, Otherwise, just get rid of it. Its returning you the DOM element instead of jQuery's object. DOM elements don't have a css() method, jQuery objects does
[10:10:11] <coachz> i really appreciate it
[10:10:16] <necromancer> docs.jquery.com is a good place to start :)
[10:10:24] <coachz> cool
[10:10:56] <larzen-wrk> shesek: oTableTools.dom.container <-- returns ObjectHTMLDivElement .. i want to set a css syle on this?
[10:11:01] <coachz> Traversing section i bet
[10:11:23] <shesek> larzen-wrk, pass it to $() and use css() on the returned object
[10:11:27] <coachz> lowrisk,  thanks for helping me too
[10:11:31] <shesek> e.g. $(oTableTools.dom.container).css({ ... })
[10:11:50] <shesek> Or just work with plain javascript, oTableTools.dom.container.style.foo = 'bar';
[10:11:52] <larzen-wrk> shesek: perfect, let me try.
[10:12:15] <larzen-wrk> shesek: $(oTableTools.dom.container).css({"float: right"}); <-- thats right?
[10:12:50] <shesek> larzen-wrk, no, the "float" should be the property key and "right" should be the value
[10:12:52] <t4nkd> Hey has anyone used a dropdown plugin(like superfish?) or knows of one that's relativly new/optomized? At the moment I'm using superfish but getting some quirks as I don't really know/understand suckerfish dropdowns
[10:12:58] <shesek> you just used them both as one string, it'll throw a syntax error
[10:15:20] <t4nkd> Anyone? Even if it's just the "one you like"?
[10:15:34] <trumpetmic> Hey folks!  I'm already using firebug.  Are there any other great tools to use for developing with jQuery?
[10:15:41] <t4nkd> Firequery
[10:17:10] <trumpetmic> t4nkd: cool thanks
[10:17:14] <t4nkd> np
[10:20:19] <djquery> hmmm did jsbin just add the download button or have I been missing it?
[10:20:27] <Bodu> please have a look at this http://forum.jquery.com/topic/browser-problems-with-click-and-load
[10:21:04] <djquery> damn jsbin made a lot of changes.
[10:21:31] <Aquaguy> Hello
[10:21:39] <SpinachHead> I use superfish and like it, but had to customize it so the right most elements open out to the left
[10:23:54] <Aquaguy> Hello, I'm trying to increase and decrease a certain value when pressing the + and - keys, it almost works... I can't get rid of the symbol after the number, any help? The input bellow the Text Cantidad.
[10:23:55] <Aquaguy> icarusdev.dyndns.org/abibel/store/index.php
[10:24:19] <djquery> damn now if jsbin would just let me login so that I can see a list of my jsbins it would replace jsfiddle for me
[10:24:19] <Aquaguy> http://pastebin.com/NUz1w26N
[10:24:23] <Aquaguy> that's the function
[10:25:45] <blindMoe> think I still like jsfiddle's setup compared to jsbin.. but jsbin does look better now
[10:25:53] <blindMoe> (better than it did before)
[10:25:54] <Aquaguy> Anyone?
[10:26:21] <djquery> blindMoe: like the new way that they are showing errors
[10:26:38] <djquery> and you can actualy click on the error message and go to that line
[10:26:40] <blindMoe> ahh I haven't seen that yet.. I will break something and see what it says :)
[10:27:31] <djquery> blindMoe: still needs a tidyup button
[10:27:43] <blindMoe> djinni: the error reporting is pretty nice
[10:28:18] <djinni> *poof* I grant you three correct tab completions
[10:28:50] <djquery> blindMoe: seems like if you check real-time and then try to go back to javascrit and html the html never shows
[10:29:18] <Aquaguy> ...
[10:30:28] <blindMoe> djquery: not sure I see what you mean
[10:30:33] <necromancer> how much overhead does a jquery plugin have over a function that takes a single jquery object?
[10:31:25] <BlackAnt> hmm
[10:31:32] <Aquaguy> bufffff
[10:31:38] <BlackAnt> kaffocscs
[10:31:39] <djquery> blindMoe: it looks like a bug open this http://jsbin.com/ewuja3/edit   notice that both the javascript and the html pane are vis. put a check in realtime, notice html is replace by preview of page.
[10:31:48] <Michael> Anyone using FF5?
[10:31:52] <djquery> uncheck realtime and html doesnt come back
[10:32:21] <blindMoe> djquery: what browser are you in?  Seems fine in chrome ... may also be your resolution
[10:32:33] <djquery> necromancer: none realy.
[10:32:48] <necromancer> Michael: yeah i just got it
[10:32:57] <djquery> necromancer: now a jqueryui plugin will have a little more overhead but not much
[10:33:05] <BlackAnt> not sure to take the update
[10:33:09] <necromancer> nah i'm just looking for a jquery plugin
[10:33:11] <djquery> blindMoe: chrome 12
[10:33:24] <necromancer> i think it's rather silly to make a regular JS function if the only arg is a jQuery object
[10:34:11] <blindMoe> djquery: hrmm... works fine here :/
[10:34:27] <djquery> blindMoe: its somethin I can live with
[10:35:13] <djquery> blindMoe: will have to come back later and check its code completion
[10:35:39] <blindMoe> it has code completion?
[10:35:40] <blindMoe> nice
[10:35:43] <djquery> necromancer: the main thing is do you want you fucntion chaniable
[10:36:04] <necromancer> djq
[10:36:05] <djquery> blindMoe: hit ctrl+shift+?
[10:36:11] <necromancer> djquery: nah that doesn't matter in this case i don't think
[10:36:12] <djquery> or something
[10:36:16] <blindMoe> oh crazy
[10:36:21] <blindMoe> that popup looks clean
[10:36:38] <necromancer> djquery: the main goal here is to have as much of the JS in a separate file as possible
[10:36:47] <necromancer> djquery: the main goal here is to have as much of the JS as possible in a separate file*
[10:36:48] <necromancer> haha
[10:36:55] <sqrbrkt> hi all, I've got a cookie that keeps coming back after I've deleted it in Chrome. Nothing on the page is setting the cookie as far as I can tell... Could it be a path issue?
[10:37:22] <NoNoNo> sqrbrkt: google evercookie
[10:37:35] <necromancer> i also want to be able to alter the class name without having to update the JS code
[10:38:08] <sqrbrkt> NoNoNo: nah it's a cookie I'm setting in my code. Weirdly it keeps coming back
[10:39:48] <sqrbrkt> I'm setting the cookie value to 0 rather than setting it to null - maybe that's part of the problem...
[10:41:01] <necromancer> does require.js not work with inline JS?
[10:41:35] <djquery> sqrbrkt: you need to set the expiration of the cookie to some date in the past to delete it I believe
[10:42:38] <sqrbrkt> djquery: thanks but the cookie does appear to be deleted (at least doesn't show up in Chrome's debugger) until I return to a specific page when suddenly it reappears
[10:43:28] <Null_> having problems where I can load stuff via .load fine, but I'm trying to do the same via an already hashed url, and instead it's not using ajax. http://jsfiddle.net/n8Eg3/  http://therightrealtor.ca/featured.php#featured.php clicking the "Click for Full Listing" doesn't work, but it works at http://therightrealtor.ca/featured.php.  How could I get either working as expected?
[10:44:01] <SirFunk> is it valid to have mutiple checboxes that have the same name? (sort of representing an array?)
[10:45:45] <djquery> SirFunk: yes
[10:46:02] <SirFunk> djquery: thought so, thanks
[10:46:02] <djquery> SirFunk: only the ones that are checked will be sent to the server.
[10:46:25] <SirFunk> right, now, i'm trying to figure out how to grab them into a json array
[10:46:48] <SirFunk> i have a serializeJSON function, but if i have 4 items checked it only shows the last one
[10:46:49] <djquery> SirFunk: see ?serializetoarray
[10:46:50] <bot-t> SirFunk, .serializeArray() - Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[10:50:39] <djquery> SirFunk: that do it for you?
[10:50:52] <SirFunk> djquery: almost, not really the format i need
[10:51:10] <SirFunk> i think i can handle it though
[10:51:11] <SirFunk> thanks
[10:51:21] <djquery> SirFunk: {data: $(form).serializeArray()}
[10:52:15] <Ramosa> how can you see if an object is a jquery or DOM in firebug console?
[10:52:22] <SirFunk> well that makes it like "[{"name":"tags","value":"2"},{"name":"tags","value":"1"}]"
[10:52:35] <SirFunk> i need {"tags":{1,2,3}} or something liek that
[10:53:22] <shesek> Ramosa, Just run console.log(document.body, $(document.body)) and see
[10:53:22] <djquery> SirFunk: name you items <input type="checkbox" name="tags[]" />
[10:53:30] <salazr> hey.. question.. working with $tmpl, my data is a an array of objects, like [{name},{name}].. how can i iterate through in with {{each}} ?? or rather, how can i grab the parent/source object? so I can do something like {{each item}}${name}{{/each}} ???
[10:54:29] <anniex> hi
[10:54:31] <salazr> can't figure it out at all.. if my source was formatted as [{items[{name}{name}]}], it would work, but i cant figure out how to do this without having a way to refer to the data
[10:54:34] <djquery> salazr: just give template the name fo the template and it would loop through it automagicaly
[10:55:27] <djquery> salazr: see ?demo
[10:55:28] <bot-t> salazr, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:55:47] <djquery> salazr: I have been workin with templates for a while let me take a look
[10:56:08] <salazr> djquery: thanks, i'll set up a jsfiddle
[10:57:25] <djquery> blindMoe: damn just checked ou tthe code completion and it kicks ass
[10:57:33] <khurram> hi every one
[10:57:53] <blindMoe> I tried it on that paste you linked to an it was pretty nice.. read all the properties and everything out of the plugin
[10:57:58] <blindMoe> I didn't go much beyond that though
[10:58:24] <khurram> i have uploaded the site and tested it in firefox it is working fine and when i test it in the same firefox on some other computer it doesn't work can some tell me how to debug this issue?
[10:58:40] <Bodu> please have a look at my post and specialy last one. http://forum.jquery.com/topic/browser-problems-with-click-and-load
[10:59:09] <djquery> blindMoe: var x = {'name': 'test', 'xyq': '123'}    type x.x then hit escape
[10:59:17] <elyphas> I am using JqGrid, but I want to get data and store it in a variable, How can I do this?
[10:59:26] <nail_> SirFunk: foo = { tags: $(':checkbox:checked').map(function() { return $(this).attr('name'); }).get() };
[10:59:39] <blindMoe> djquery: nice!
[10:59:58] <SirFunk> nail_: that looks good
[11:00:15] <salazr> djquery: DUH figured it out while doing the jsfiddle.. holy shit, it iterates through each object withot me doing {{each}} .. hah .. see: http://jsfiddle.net/8admf/
[11:00:50] <khurram> i have jquery in the head section of my page and the data is in the body tag  does that cause any problem in chrome or ie. i am getting it alright only in my computer
[11:01:32] <khurram> please can one click on this link and check what could be the cause of error  http://khurram.yaqeenitrades.com
[11:01:37] <Ramosa> sheshek, console.log($document.body); returns null
[11:04:53] <khurram> hello ?
[11:05:01] <khurram> coldhead: ?
[11:07:28] <khurram> anyone awake here ?
[11:07:40] <Z3R0> ?
[11:07:53] <Z3R0> I loaded that site, nothing happened... don't have the code, so I don't know what you are trying to accomplish...
[11:08:03] <Z3R0> http://www.jsfiddle.net please
[11:08:52] <dnyy> Does anyone know if it's possible to have jCarousel constrain both width & height within a list? Right now, if a user uploads a photo with retarded portions (130x650), the height is way too big.
[11:09:19] <Z3R0> sorry never heard of jCarousel lol
[11:09:30] <dnyy> Z3R0: :P
[11:09:33] <Z3R0> still semi-new to the jQuery ^_^
[11:09:36] <dnyy> if only every library had an IRC channel. :(
[11:09:42] <Z3R0> no kidding...
[11:09:59] <miketaylr> khurram: what in the unholy hell are you trying to do with data-blog !??
[11:10:03] <Z3R0> irc.jStuff.net // lolz hahahahahahaa
[11:10:05] <khurram> please can one click on this link and check what could be the cause of error  http://khurram.yaqeenitrades.com
[11:10:14] <miketaylr> http://miketaylr.com/post/7cee1061.png
[11:10:24] <miketaylr> W T F
[11:10:31] <khurram> miketaylr: ah thanks champ it is working fine in my computer
[11:11:13] <khurram> basically it takes too long to load on ajax requests so i down load all the data once in the body-data tag and then use jquery to fetch the content by passing it the <li> id
[11:11:41] <miketaylr> screw ajax, just load the content as html
[11:11:50] <khurram> it only works in firefox in mycomputer and i dont know whats thing is causing the problem at other computer firefoxes
[11:12:01] <miketaylr> it doesn't work in opera
[11:12:01] <khurram> there is no ajax there any more
[11:12:09] <miketaylr> um yeah, there's an empty site
[11:12:10] <khurram> its all javascript inside that page no ajax
[11:12:18] <miketaylr> this is a bad idea
[11:12:48] <khurram> i have firefox 4 why this works in my computer only ???????
[11:13:04] <miketaylr> probably because you're trying something that makes no sense
[11:13:26] <khurram> i wish if it worked you will see its very benefical for me
[11:13:33] <miketaylr> khurram: what's wrong with just displaying the content as plain html?
[11:13:48] <miketaylr> so like, if javascript craps out (as yours is obviously doing), the content still shows
[11:13:53] <miketaylr> and so google can index it?
[11:13:54] <khurram> it is actually working perfectly fine in my localhost and as well as from the server but only on my computer huh
[11:14:00] <miketaylr> well
[11:14:03] <miketaylr> ?glwtd
[11:14:03] <bot-t> http://goodluckwiththatdude.com/
[11:14:24] <miketaylr> aw sad, site's down
[11:14:26] <khurram> hmm
[11:14:51] <Z3R0> ? jfgi
[11:14:51] <khurram> so is why this problem is not happening in my firefox ?
[11:14:52] <bot-t> Just Fucking Google It - http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com
[11:15:27] <khurram> ah beautiful
[11:16:00] <miketaylr> khurram: do you have any other browsers other than firefox?
[11:16:12] <zfmf> hi is there a callback function on jqueryui tabs, for onclick
[11:16:24] <miketaylr> for example, go download http://opera.com/browser/
[11:16:28] <Z3R0> I loaded it with FF
[11:16:31] <miketaylr> and notice that it does *not* work
[11:16:32] <Z3R0> still fails
[11:16:39] <khurram> i have tested it on IE and chorom it doesn't work site is empty with data loaded in the body tag , it works only in MY FIREFOX
[11:16:57] <djquery> ?lmgtfu
[11:16:58] <bot-t> djquery, Couldn't find "lmgtfu" in jQuery Docs.
[11:17:09] <miketaylr> aka YOUR SHIT IS BROKEN
[11:17:15] <Z3R0> I still don't know why you don't just use a HTML page...
[11:17:25] <djquery> ?lmgtfu test
[11:17:26] <bot-t> djquery, Couldn't find "lmgtfu test" in jQuery Docs.
[11:17:31] <miketaylr> Z3R0++
[11:17:36] <khurram> i used jlint to varify it as well and nothing came up
[11:17:37] <Z3R0> if I'm correct to, can't you load specific divs of a page into a div ?
[11:17:44] <djquery> damn who got rid of let me google that for you?
[11:17:53] <Z3R0> so you could load('rawr.html #thisdivonly') ?
[11:17:58] <miketaylr> yep
[11:18:00] <Z3R0> ? lmgtfi
[11:18:01] <bot-t> Z3R0, Couldn't find "lmgtfi" in jQuery Docs.
[11:18:03] <Z3R0> awww
[11:18:13] <Z3R0> !earn lmgtfi http://letmegooglethatforyou.com
[11:18:18] <Z3R0> !learn lmgtfi http://letmegooglethatforyou.com
[11:18:20] <Z3R0> lolz
[11:18:34] <khurram> only in firefox and only firefox in my windows7 cheers
[11:18:36] <Z3R0> that's what I would do instaed...
[11:18:54] <Z3R0> one HTML page, different div's for content, load html @ Div location into Main Div
[11:19:08] <khurram> ?fgmlmuijmkjsiasdkslaijksklsdifknamafafkajdfoafaf
[11:19:10] <bot-t> khurram, Couldn't find "fgmlmuijmkjsiasdkslaijksklsdifknamafafkajdfoafaf" in jQuery Docs.
[11:19:13] <khurram> :)
[11:19:15] <khurram> take that
[11:19:24] <systemfault> ?love
[11:19:25] <bot-t> ‚ô• U
[11:19:46] <miketaylr> khurram: you just need to drop this data-blog craziness and load that content as regular HTML
[11:20:29] <Z3R0> no kidding, do something that obviously works... rather than something that is well... dumb ?
[11:20:38] <Z3R0> would be much easier to layout cleanly as well....
[11:20:56] <sean`> ?lmgtfy @ Z3R0
[11:20:57] <bot-t> Z3R0, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=
[11:21:08] <Z3R0> O.o
[11:21:16] <Z3R0> I don't need to google anything... I google everything
[11:21:27] <khurram> i can not  i need to make it quick to appear instantly can fffffing wait for the page to go to his mum and fetch the content i have to debug and fffff this to work properly
[11:21:39] <sean`> wtf?
[11:21:44] <sean`> http://khurram.yaqeenitrades.com
[11:21:46] <miketaylr> yeah so that's not working out for you, khurram
[11:22:05] <miketaylr> what you need is something like infinite scroll to ajax in content that's far down the page
[11:22:07] <sean`> what's with the hex colours
[11:22:15] <miketaylr> but load the top stuff as plain HTML...not as AJAX
[11:22:24] <Z3R0> sean` don't worry about the hex colors, look at the data-blog code in the source lol
[11:22:30] <Z3R0> yes, you don't need ajax...
[11:22:32] <miketaylr> khurram: but what you're doing has *NO* advantage over loading it as plain HTML
[11:22:32] <sean`> Z3R0, I know
[11:22:35] <Z3R0> you're just .load() the page
[11:22:52] <miketaylr> khurram: since you're making the user download all the content anyways
[11:23:12] <khurram> i am using gz_handler
[11:23:20] <sean`> oh, you're fine then
[11:23:24] <miketaylr> hahahahha
[11:23:31] <miketaylr> except it doesn't work in any browser except your magical firefox
[11:23:37] <Z3R0> and only FFF 4
[11:23:43] <Z3R0> using 3.6.1 and it fails
[11:23:49] <miketaylr> aight, good luck i'm done
[11:23:49] <khurram> it is 70% optimized from what it was before
[11:23:58] <Z3R0> and yet... doesn't work...
[11:24:02] <miketaylr> 70% of not working....
[11:24:05] <khurram> ah thanks champ
[11:24:06] <Z3R0> so right now, it's 70% optimized... and 0% functional
[11:24:17] <khurram> so that fffff is causing the problem.. lol
[11:24:28] <djquery> http://jsbin.tumblr.com/post/6753388869/introducing-js-bin-2-8-0-with-live-previews
[11:24:41] <khurram> ok i remove it and test it it would take just a bit long to load though and after that it is the roubust solutino ;)
[11:24:49] <Z3R0> hmmm... it is working...
[11:24:54] <Z3R0> although your links don't look like links

[11:43:14] <djquery> stupid arrows http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/Vseyz/3/
[11:43:40] <Mythmon> in general, is it difficult to upgrade between major versions of jquery? say, 1.4 -> 1.5 or 1.5 -> 1.6 ?
[11:43:44] <djquery> how do I make them appear on the same line. It should be display just like a ui.accordion at this point
[11:45:26] <shesek> Mythmon, I rarely see anything breaks from upgrading jQuery
[11:45:50] <shesek> It has great backward compatibility, they usually only add new features
[11:46:25] <Hierofant> Hi guys.  I'm looking for advice.  I've built a very basic CMS with a jQuery front end.  The main functionality it needs is to upload, title, and reorder images.  I'd like to replace the PHP with a pre-built CMS that I can "conceal" somewhat when complete, still keeping my jQuery front-end.  Any recommendations?
[11:47:21] <sean`> Hierofant, sup
[11:47:26] <bja> is the method that ie8's developer tools uses to change CSS on the fly the same that gets used by jquery's .css?
[11:48:10] <DJTrey1> how can I parse the value of #txtMaxDate into a millisecond? Can't I use datepicker.parseDate or something? http://jsfiddle.net/MTxbn/15/
[11:50:21] <Phoenixz> I need to replace the "name" attribute for 44 dhtml elements.. each 'name' attribute has something like "user1name" which will be replaced with "user2name".. All data elements have "vdata" class.. I thought this would work, but it errors on replace() method does not exist for undefined..  $(domObject).find('.vdata').attr('id'  , $(domObject).find('.vdata').attr('id')  .replace(/([a-z]*)(\d)([a-z]*)/i, '$1' + vCurrentId + '$3'));
[11:50:26] <Phoenixz> What am I doing wrong here?
[11:50:53] <Hierofant> hi sean` :)
[11:50:55] <sean`> Phoenixz, what about templating
[11:51:47] <Phoenixz> sean`: templating?
[11:51:49] <sean`> also this.name = this.name.replace (/\d+/, vCurrentId)
[11:51:56] <sean`> should be enough
[11:52:08] <Phoenixz> sean`: doh, you're right on that one.. :)
[11:52:10] <Phoenixz> sean`: but
[11:52:23] <Phoenixz> sean`: 1) What is "templating" in jQuery
[11:52:38] <sean`> Phoenixz, what's 2)
[11:53:07] <Phoenixz> sean`: 2) I think the $(domElement).find('.vdata') returns some 44 elements.. will the .replace() method work on that, or would I have to make some each() loop?
[11:53:16] <Phoenixz> sean`: There is 2 :)
[11:53:31] <necromancer> anyone here use textmate? how do you get jQuery templates to be syntax highlighted?
[11:53:40] <sean`> Phoenixz, each it babe
[11:53:48] <sean`> also 1) google that ish
[11:53:55] <sean`> ?tmpl
[11:53:56] <bot-t> sean`, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[11:53:59] <sean`> is also a possibility
[11:54:19] <Hierofant> Has anyone tried to build a wordpress site with completely their own jQuery front end?
[11:55:02] <DimmuR> Hello i'm using jquery tabbs and some own methods that shows/hide panel with tabbs. When panel with tabbs have display:none; and i change it through jquery (using .show()) i don't see content of tabbs. Is there something speciall that is required for tabbs to be fully rendered even they are hidden at start?
[11:55:11] <Phoenixz> sean`: templates is a beta jquery plugin? (just so that Im looking at the right thing)
[11:55:20] <Phoenixz> sean`: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl
[11:55:36] <sean`> Phoenixz, it's good enought o use i production
[11:55:50] <sean`> same goes for stuff like mustache, or the simplicity delivered by _ (UnderscoreJS)
[11:57:09] <Phoenixz> sean`: _js looks nice! will check it out
[11:57:21] <jeffsmykil> Is there just a move function?
[11:57:33] <jeffsmykil> its a long story but i need to move something from one spot to another
[11:58:00] <sean`> Phoenixz, backbone is also hot
[11:58:05] <sean`> jeffsmykil, yes
[11:58:28] <sean`> before, after, insert(Before|After), append, html
[11:58:29] <sean`> etc. etc. etc
[11:58:31] <jeffsmykil> is it just .move('destination) ?
[11:58:52] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[11:59:06] <jeffsmykil> I have to remove it from one place and move it to another its because of ASP
[11:59:21] <sean`> sure
[11:59:26] <sean`> just rtfm
[11:59:28] <jeffsmykil> the button is on a different piece of the page but I need to put it on the other piece
[11:59:33] <jeffsmykil> thanks dude
[11:59:38] <jeffsmykil> big help
[12:00:00] <sean`> jeffsmykil, if you read what I said, you will :-)
[12:01:10] <jeffsmykil> cant find insert in the FM only append
[12:01:59] <sean`> jeffsmykil, insert(Before|After)
[12:02:05] <bja> can .css() set padding-bottom/left/right/top in IE8?
[12:02:07] <sean`> meaning, insertAfter or insertBefore
[12:02:07] <jeffsmykil> can I do $('.foo').append('.bar');
[12:02:11] <sean`> ?insertafter @ jeffsmykil
[12:02:11] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, .insertAfter(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[12:02:17] <sean`> ?after @ jeffsmykil
[12:02:17] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, .after(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[12:02:22] <sean`> ?before @ jeffsmykil
[12:02:22] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, .before(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, before each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/before/
[12:02:29] <bja> like $('.foo').css("padding-bottom", "0px");
[12:02:32] <sean`> Is that like, enough?
[12:02:42] <sean`> bja, yeah, shouldn't be an issue
[12:03:06] <jeffsmykil> dude with all due respect, don't be a douche bag.  I'm sorry I didn't understand what you were saying
[12:03:35] <sean`> I got <3 for u
[12:05:17] <bja> so, I have a problem I'm trying to solve with jquery, but perhaps it's not appropriate
[12:05:45] <sean`> ?ask @ bja
[12:05:45] <bot-t> bja, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:06:12] <djquery> sean` is on a roll
[12:06:15] <bja> if I set a given css selector from its current setting of padding: 3px 4px; to specifying it for each property (top, bottom, etc), IE8 appears to ignore the issue
[12:06:25] <bja> however, if I use IE8's CSS Tool to change the property on the fly
[12:06:30] <bja> stuff works as expected
[12:06:37] <Bodu> please take a look @ my post especialy the last one. thanks a lot http://forum.jquery.com/topic/browser-problems-with-click-and-load
[12:06:40] <sean`> bja, can you set up a jsfiddle?
[12:06:42] <Phoenixz> In an each(function(index, Element){}); Can I do $(Element).attr('id').replace(); ?
[12:06:43] <bja> using jquery's .css() on that same selector also appears to have no effect
[12:06:58] <sean`> Phoenixz, yeah, but that won't do anything + it's expensive
[12:06:58] <djquery> bja: see ?demo
[12:06:59] <bot-t> bja, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:07:19] <sean`> Phoenixz, .each (fn () { this.id = this.id.replace ( .. ) }); // jus tlike I showed you
[12:08:00] <djquery> Phoenixz: and some version of ie throw a fit if you change an id
[12:08:01] <bja> ok
[12:08:05] <bja> setting up a working demo
[12:08:14] <sean`> it's better to use .setAttribute btw
[12:08:41] <bja> do you know of an internet-facing copy of jquery easyui?
[12:08:48] <sean`> Bodu, it's not event.returnValue, it's "return false;"
[12:09:09] <sean`> bja, ?
[12:09:42] <Phoenixz> sean`: Thanks!
[12:09:59] <bja> it's a framework I found that had a datagrid that did what I needed it to
[12:10:10] <bja> jeasyui.com
[12:10:35] <jeffsmykil> my condolonces for working with asp
[12:10:45] <jeffsmykil> its painful for me hate to see someone else having to deal with it
[12:11:03] <bja> asp?
[12:11:07] <Phoenixz> djquery: *that* I'll look into.. What I do is I have a form, which I need to duplicate.. Basically I would not need "id", but since I have labels with for='' attribute, ID is required for at least a few elements.. And I have to avoid double id's, so.. Copying the table, I would change the ID in the copy which is not part of the DOM structure yet.. first I change the ID in the object, THEN I would insert it into the dom.. Would this cause problems in
[12:11:09] <Phoenixz> IE?
[12:11:18] <jeffsmykil> bja I assumed thats what you are doing because of the datagrid reff
[12:11:33] <Phoenixz> sean`: that code is a whole lot cleaner yeah..
[12:11:33] <bja> no, there is an object in easyui called datagrid
[12:11:35] <ch3mical> Anyone want to help with a css issue. It's loosely jquery-related ;p
[12:11:41] <ch3mical> Nobody in #css knows
[12:12:00] <jeffsmykil> they can be kind of mean ch3mical what's up?
[12:12:18] <jeffsmykil> well i mean some of them in there, like in here
[12:12:19] <trumpetmic> bja: is easyui like jQuery UI?
[12:12:25] <ch3mical> Naw they're being cool, but no one has an answer for me
[12:12:28] <bja> as far as I can tell it is
[12:12:43] <sean`> for the easjsui
[12:12:43] <bja> except it has a grid app that exists with locking headers and columns
[12:12:48] <sean`> also see wijimo
[12:12:50] <ch3mical> http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/w8V4N/ when you click on "more info" it should expand the grey box
[12:13:02] <djquery> Phoenixz: if you change the id before you add it to the dom hopefully u will be ok
[12:13:11] <bja> that's actually the only part of easyui that I'm using
[12:13:12] <Phoenixz> ch3mical: what about if you actually ask your question? :)
[12:13:19] <bja> been pretty happy with jQuery UI otherwise
[12:13:45] <Phoenixz> djquery: that is the idea yeah, I'd only be working on an individual object which I will insert later on..
[12:13:48] <jeffsmykil> ch3mical: which gray box
[12:14:13] <jeffsmykil> ch3mical you are hiding and showing the same element on click
[12:14:16] <Phoenixz> sean`: would this.name also work?
[12:14:27] <sean`> ?tias @ Phoenixz
[12:14:27] <bot-t> Phoenixz, Try It And See
[12:14:27] <jeffsmykil> and you are missing a closing curly brac
[12:14:28] <jeffsmykil> e
[12:14:28] <ch3mical> #dBreakdown
[12:14:33] <sean`> also console.dir that this
[12:15:28] <jeffsmykil> ch3mical you have mukltiple elements with the same ID?
[12:15:33] <ch3mical> Nope
[12:15:37] <Phoenixz> sean`: I'm all in TIAS, its just that I'd like to know if its a good idea.. Lots of thigns are posslble, doesnt mean its a good idea still :)
[12:15:45] <ch3mical> Nevermind, I just figured it out, thanks for trying jeffsmykil
[12:15:52] <systemfault> ch3mical: Check the height on dHyperlink
[12:16:04] <ch3mical> There was a height value on .... what systemfault just sauid
[12:16:07] <Phoenixz> sean`: because afaik, it does work..
[12:16:08] <ch3mical> said*
[12:16:16] <jeffsmykil> ch3mical its toggling for me in ff
[12:16:32] <jeffsmykil> sorry
[12:16:33] <sean`> Phoenixz, accessing, this.* is okay
[12:16:36] <ch3mical> jeffsmykil: thanks, I got it fixed
[12:16:38] <ch3mical> :)
[12:16:42] <sean`> setting this.setAttribute is more appropriate, also this.getAttribute
[12:16:55] <sean`> Phoenixz, if you want to stay in jQuery's safe zone and still have speed
[12:17:10] <sean`> you don't need to do var $this = $(this), name = $this.attr ('name');
[12:17:58] <djquery> ch3mical: just remove the jquery and fiddle with the css till u get it looking like its supposed to look when expanded
[12:18:03] <larzen-wrk> question: I am working with a jQuery component .. and when I inspect the DOM using FireBug, I get this type of thing Object { "property" = "value", "property = "value" } <-- what type of object is this and how do I access each individual parameter?
[12:18:07] <sean`> you could do var name = $.attr (this, 'name')
[12:18:23] <sean`> Phoenixz, http://jsfiddle.net/AZtKM/ if you don't need a jQuery object, using direct methods is at least 10x faster
[12:18:53] <Phoenixz> sean`: Thats what I mean! Thanks!!
[12:21:57] <ch3mical> djquery: thanks I'll keep that in mind next time
[12:23:31] <larzen-wrk> is there a way to easily convert a jQuery object to a JSON string?
[12:24:08] <sean`> larzen-wrk, that might not be what you want
[12:24:30] <sean`> You should look into the .map method, it allowes you to create a specific jquery object
[12:24:38] <larzen-wrk> Sean for restful servic submission?
[12:24:43] <BlackAnt> I love jQuery. Don't you? or this is just a funny sentence?

[12:38:41] <progrock> size the parent... overflow: visible
[12:39:07] <blindMoe> even with the parent sized the child element sizes to the parents size
[12:39:20] <blindMoe> kinda want to do it w/o sizing the parent but I am not finding a way around that
[12:39:28] <progrock> if you allow overflwo, the chilkd can be larger
[12:39:36] <blindMoe> overflow is set to visible already

[12:47:57] <kojiro> blindMoe: ies4linux?
[12:47:58] * blindMoe gives BlackAnt a cookie and a pat on the head
[12:48:18] * BlackAnt sends the seven plagues of Egypt to blindMoe
[12:48:36] <BlackAnt> :D
[12:48:37] <blindMoe> kojiro: I'll look into it.. thx
[12:48:40] <kojiro> BlackAnt: did he enslave you?
[12:49:12] <BlackAnt> hahah who's asking for internet explorer in linux? hahahaa

[12:50:47] <BlackAnt> hmm good thought
[12:51:04] <feathersanddown> and for southern hemisphere?
[12:52:12] <kojiro> feathersanddown: southern hemisphere doesn't have days. They have dyes.

[12:57:14] <BlackAnt> kojiro Anatawa nihingo ga wakarimus ka?
[12:57:47] <BlackAnt> kojiro Anatawa nihongo ga wakarimus ka?
[12:57:55] <kelthar> z1000:   ("#form").find('input.rq').addClass('required');
[12:58:05] <kojiro> BlackAnt: sukosi dake ga
[12:59:12] <BlackAnt> kojiro Arigato. Anata Japan ji desu ka?
[12:59:31] <kelthar> z1000: i think $("#form > input.rq").addClass works aswell ... i think > is find
[12:59:38] <kelthar> otherwise it's children
[12:59:49] <z1000> kelthar, it worked perfect, thanks
[12:59:54] <BlackAnt> kojiro gat to go.. talk tomorrow
[13:00:10] <kojiro> BlackAnt: asita ne
[13:00:11] <jessicaf> can someone tell me whats the problem with my jquery http://pastebin.com/wmgPWqZs
[13:00:18] <BlackAnt> lol
[13:00:19] <Samot> another CDN hosting jquery - http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2680035
[13:00:28] <kojiro> jessicaf: are you getting an error?
[13:00:30] <jessicaf> it loads up the two buttons but when i press the button it doesnt redirect which its supposed to
[13:00:35] <jessicaf> no error
[13:00:38] <BlackAnt> kojiro thats not even romanji
[13:00:38] <BlackAnt> lol
[13:00:38] <BlackAnt> cya all
[13:00:41] <jessicaf> everything works fine
[13:00:45] <kojiro> jessicaf: could you do a mockup at jsfiddle?
[13:00:58] <jessicaf> what is that
[13:01:06] <Z3R0> http://www.jsfiddle.net
[13:01:34] <kelthar> jessicaf: kind of an emulator
[13:01:44] <kojiro> jessicaf: pure awesome in a box of win tied with a bow of free
[13:02:03] <Z3R0> es, it is pure awesome
[13:02:05] <Z3R0> I love that thing
[13:02:16] <kojiro> I love it for things that don't require ajax ;)
[13:02:26] <Z3R0> only thing I wish it had was the ability to do $.post stuff
[13:02:34] <kojiro> Z3R0: yeah
[13:03:26] <jessicaf> i am actually new to jquery and i dont understand the emulater thing you linked me up with
[13:03:38] <Z3R0> you justt copy and paste your stuf finto the corresponding fields
[13:03:57] <Z3R0> the HTML elements into HTML, the Javascript (Jquery) into the top part, any css that you have styling it into the CSS
[13:04:06] <Z3R0> and then viola! you see a live edittable demo of your code in action
[13:04:17] <kojiro> and more importantly, we can see what is going on
[13:04:34] <Z3R0> then we can UPDATE it, show you the update, and you can see what was changed and how it works afterwards
[13:05:23] <MoTiOnXml> how do I get the y-offset the user has scrolled down a page?
[13:05:35] <MoTiOnXml> $(document).scrollTop() etc. always gives 0
[13:06:34] <jessicaf> i got a php script instead of a html
[13:06:42] <blindMoe> j css
[13:06:45] <blindMoe> err
[13:06:52] <blindMoe> forgot a / ;)
[13:07:04] <MoTiOnXml> $(window).scrollTop() gives 0
[13:08:05] <jessicaf> okay what i am trying to do here is load two php scripts in the same page using jquery
[13:08:51] <MoTiOnXml> ah, it does, but you can't use it in "ready"
[13:08:52] <MoTiOnXml> weird
[13:09:04] <MoTiOnXml> it's like the browser "scrolls" down after "ready" has been called
[13:12:43] <Z3R0> example of how jsfiddle works jessicaf http://jsfiddle.net/BPSC9/10/
[13:13:22] <Z3R0> can you just put your code there even if it doesn't work
[13:14:51] <Z3R0> jessicaf ?
[13:15:10] <jessicaf> yes but i am using php and two other php scripts
[13:15:29] <Z3R0> that's fine, just put your php code in the html section, just so we can see what you are messing with
[13:15:40] <Z3R0> just the first page, the other two are obvious, because you are trying to import them
[13:15:43] <jessicaf> http://pastebin.com/wmgPWqZs
[13:16:09] <jessicaf> the button contains values stored for that session
[13:16:13] <jessicaf> session variables two of them
[13:16:17] <jessicaf> and even a cookie variable
[13:16:57] <Z3R0> ok so what's the problem currently ?
[13:17:38] <jessicaf> using if i open up button2.php and bress the button it will redirect me to another page
[13:17:51] <jessicaf> now when i load up using jquery the button in the webpage and press it .. it does nothing
[13:18:50] <t4nkd> Nothing at all?
[13:20:55] <Aquaguy> Hello, I have a series of input text elements and I want to retrieve the one which it's value is "choose me"
[13:20:58] <Aquaguy> how can I do that?
[13:22:38] <dabear> ?filter @Aquaguy
[13:22:39] <bot-t> Aquaguy, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[13:23:09] <dabear> .filter(function(){ return this.value == "choose me";})
[13:23:35] <Z3R0> ?load
[13:23:35] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[13:23:39] <Z3R0> omg, that's sexy
[13:23:58] <initzero> Aquaguy, $(:text[value="choose me"])
[13:24:16] <initzero> sorry - forgot the quotes
[13:24:19] <dabear> yes, by all means do a slower query
[13:24:28] <dabear> instead of using filter..
[13:24:46] <initzero> interesting, I thought filter was for a jquery object
[13:25:04] <dabear> it is
[13:27:07] <initzero> so would the full example be $(":text").filter( fn )?
[13:30:06] <dabear> :text is slow
[13:30:10] <dabear> don't use it
[13:30:21] <dabear> ":text" is the same as "*:text"
[13:30:32] <dabear> which means fetch all elements, then fitler out text elements
[13:31:05] <initzero> don't you need something insider $()?
[13:31:37] <dabear> "input:text"
[13:31:53] <dabear> or better, #foo input:text
[13:32:28] <initzero> I thought :text was shorthand for input:text
[13:44:16] <MoTiOnXml> if you .remove() an element, is it then releasing mem?
[13:52:04] <Jantire> How do I get back a JSON file from jQuery, and store it in a variable?
[13:52:11] <Jantire> i.e after the $.ajax request is complete
[13:52:17] <Jantire> the server will return a json file
[13:52:22] <Jantire> and send that back
[13:53:19] <banana-banana> sup jquery
[13:53:22] <banana-banana> new to this
[13:53:25] <banana-banana> ajax question
[13:53:38] <banana-banana> so ive got a ruby script
[13:53:39] <banana-banana> aight
[13:53:51] <vladikoff> ok
[13:53:55] <banana-banana> and i want a form that sends data to the script
[13:54:08] <banana-banana> and returns whatever the script does
[13:54:16] <banana-banana> in like a <div> or sumptin on the original page
[13:54:22] <banana-banana> is that about how this works?
[13:54:26] <ch3mical> banana-banana: see ?ajax
[13:54:27] <bot-t> banana-banana, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:54:30] <banana-banana> or have i got the concept garbled
[13:55:09] <banana-banana> bot-t: yeah that's where i was
[13:55:13] <bot-t> banana-banana, Thursday, 2011-05-19 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquerymobile-dev_20110519.log.html
[13:55:23] <ch3mical> lol
[13:55:35] <adac> hi guys does: .is(':unchecked') exist? or how to check if a checkbox is false (unchecked)?
[13:55:45] <banana-banana> fucking robots
[13:55:48] <banana-banana> makin me look like a dick
[13:55:51] <ch3mical> adac: see ?prop
[13:55:52] <bot-t> adac, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[13:55:56] <banana-banana> this is why i loved the matrix
[13:56:25] <banana-banana> oh man this is logged?
[13:56:36] <ch3mical> banana-banana: the only one that makes you look like a dick is you... so don't be a dick :)
[13:56:41] <banana-banana> now the future will know i aint smart forever
[13:56:59] <banana-banana> ch3mical: :)
[13:58:11] <lith> Hey guys, just updated to jquery mobile beta 1 and links are stuck on loading and for some odd reason, my console is saying this: Resource interpreted as image but transferred with MIME type text/html. when it loads the ajax page request
[13:58:46] <elyphas> I want to get data for jqgrid, and store them, in a variable, before send them to the server ,How can I do this?
[13:59:09] <Ely2> anyone here has some experience with the use of getting information out of a mssql database with jquery ajax?
[13:59:38] <ch3mical> Ely2: You can't directly access a database with AJAX
[13:59:59] <Ely2> you'll need some serverside script
[14:00:09] <ch3mical> Ely2: You might try php
[14:00:44] <ch3mical> I have used php for mysql, not mssql though
[14:03:19] <Ely2> well can't find any descent examples on the net :o
[14:05:43] <ch3mical> Ely2: try #php
[14:05:44] <MoTiOnXml> how would you delay calling a method?
[14:05:53] <MoTiOnXml> with proxy?
[14:05:54] <ch3mical> MoTiOnXml: You don't, just use callbacks
[14:06:18] <MoTiOnXml> ch3mical: erm, i'm binding to window.resize() ..
[14:06:48] <MoTiOnXml> ch3mical: and .. using a timer, which i'm clearing and setting upon resizing, i want to delay that call for 50 ms
[14:07:09] <ch3mical> You want to delay the event firing?
[14:07:10] <MoTiOnXml> ch3mical: so if the user rezised a lot, it waits 50ms after last resize to actually do the stuff
[14:07:20] <MoTiOnXml> ch3mical: well, sort of - ^
[14:07:23] <Ely2> well ch3mical i'm not invited :p
[14:07:54] <MoTiOnXml> ch3mical: any suggestions?
[14:08:14] <MoTiOnXml> ch3mical: so basically listen for resize, but only after the resize has stopped firing for 50ms, fire an event
[14:08:16] <MoTiOnXml> or method
[14:08:23] <ch3mical> Use setTimeout to call the function that does whatever you want to do when resizing, check the variable to see if the timer is still set and reset it if so
[14:09:08] <MoTiOnXml> ch3mical: i'm porting a lightbox from mootools and it's easy to do .delay(50) so was looking for the jquery equi
[14:09:28] <ch3mical> MoTiOnXml: see ?delay
[14:09:28] <bot-t> MoTiOnXml, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[14:09:38] <ch3mical> It only works for animations, though
[14:10:23] <MoTiOnXml> ch3mical: i think i can make do with the setTimeout()
[14:10:42] <ch3mical> MoTiOnXml: cool :)
[14:11:16] <initzero> MoTiOnXml: does this help: http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[14:11:21] <AdamDV|Away> Hello, I'm trying to use http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/ and I have it working except when I click on an image it just shows the loading image in the light box forever
[14:12:55] <MoTiOnXml> ch3mical: works perfectly - thanks
[14:13:10] <MoTiOnXml> initzero: will check your link out .. hang on
[14:14:29] <MoTiOnXml> initzero: i need it for a CMS console, so will have to "own" it personally and tailorfit
[14:16:27] <mdunham918> is it posible to extract something unique from a DOM Node. for instance, I want to create a browser plugin that will remember what DOM element you clicked on regardless of classes or id's and will highlight that div everytime you reload the page
[14:17:01] <mdunham918> the only thing i can think of is capturing the text() of the element and looking for that text again, but it would be better to store like a DOM unique ID and then look for that node again
[14:17:39] <mdunham918> do DOM nodes have more information than what the HTML provides
[14:17:45] <mdunham918> does that make sense?
[14:17:48] <coldfusion571> Yeah, I am assuming any metadata you assign to that DOM node is going to get blown away when you leave the page and the DOM.
[14:18:07] <coldfusion571> They can.. but like I said I don't think that will carry over from session to session.
[14:18:09] <mdunham918> well im wanting to remember something about the node not store something on the node
[14:18:25] <ryrych> hi guys
[14:18:26] <dxgriffiths> mdunham918: Unfortunately not.
[14:18:33] <mdunham918> hmm ok thanks
[14:18:50] <mdunham918> it would be cool if DOM nodes had like a sha1 identifier or something
[14:19:11] <ryrych> do you know if there is available this kind of pluign (rotator): http://img849.imageshack.us/img849/78/basez.jpg
[14:19:34] <dxgriffiths> mdunham918: Yeah it'd add another layer of control, that's for sure. The best thing we have now is ids.
[14:22:29] <coldfusion571> I am having trouble with a width() call.  The item I am calling it on is 'inline-block' and in all browsers I get the expected result, except for safari on an Ipad.  In this case the width is 40000+.  Any thoughts on why this might be?
[14:23:03] <AdamDV|Away> is there something wrong with "var objImagePreloader = new Image(); objImagePreloader.onload = function() { " ?
[14:25:04] <systemfault> Nothing obvious to me, I wonder why you're not using jQuery to do it though
[14:25:19] <ryrych> anyone? :)
[14:25:19] <kawohi808> hey hey guys, how can I need somee help!
[14:26:09] <kawohi808> I want to use Fancybox and grab a form from another file. Um, Ajax? How can I do this? :)
[14:28:42] <kawohi808> any help guys?
[14:32:45] <griffpup> mdunham918: you could use the .data() and store what you need but I don't think it would survive a reload if memory serves
[14:32:58] <gesman> Hello
[14:33:29] <David_Bradbury> So I currently have an image slideshow and two thumbnail bars all doing looping jQuery animations. Now, any of them running independently works great, or even two... but as soon as there are three, the animations get pretty choppy and slow. Any ideas how I might make the animations less choppy?
[14:33:54] <gesman> Q: How can script detect parameters it was invoked with. Ex: <script type="text/javascript" src="http://SITE.com/my_script?a=1&b=2"></script>   ?
[14:34:47] <Beta2K> Hello all
[14:35:43] <MoTiOnXml> if you create and embed an iframe, how do you listen for the "esc" key in that iframe?
[14:35:51] <MoTiOnXml> can you do that as the owner/creator?
[14:36:14] <David_Bradbury> Hmm. So my animations work just fine in Firefox when I'm moving the mouse around, but as soon as I stop the mouse, the animations get choppy. Ideas?
[14:36:19] <MoTiOnXml> .. guess what i'm asking is if events are bubling from the iframe to the parent document
[14:37:33] <Beta2K> I'm trying to show and hide a div when you hover a table row, here's the line I came up with that doesn't seem to do anything (but doesn't throw a error in FF either)
[14:37:36] <Beta2K> $('#itemsn').hover(function() { $('#snInstructions').show()}, function() { $('#snInstructions').hide() } };
[14:38:07] <Beta2K> I'm hiding the div in the html with display:none in it's style
[14:38:53] <devinrolsen> afternoon all.
[14:39:51] <Beta2K> As far as I understand that should work with any element with those id's
[14:41:26] <MoTiOnXml> can't you really tap into keypresses in a loaded iframe?
[14:41:35] <MoTiOnXml> even if it's coming from your own domain etc?
[14:41:47] <tash> hi, I'm considering coming from the darkside (dojo) to jquery. Can someone tell me if there are jq widgets for date/time?
[14:41:55] <tash> maybe a link to point me to?
[14:42:32] <tash> I'm building a site with concrete5 and they use jq, so I figured I should stop using dojo and learn jq
[14:43:26] <Greed> http://pastie.org/2103437
[14:43:29] <Greed> Anything inherently wrong here?
[14:43:59] <Greed> No syntax errors, but for some reason it isn't receiving any JSON, and the database insert isn't successful.
[14:44:14] <kawohi808> I want to use Fancybox and grab a form from another file. Um, Ajax? How can I do this? :)
[14:44:45] <jedimind> BLACK MAGIC
[14:44:52] <jedimind> THE CAUSE, AND ANSWER, TO ALL OF LIFES PROBLEMS
[14:44:52] <David_Bradbury> Anybody know why my jquery animations are slow in Firefox unless the mouse is moving? As soon as I move the mouse around it starts smoothing out
[14:44:59] <Greed> kawohi808: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[14:45:14] <Greed> David_Bradbury, Firefox 3 or 4?
[14:45:23] <David_Bradbury> Greed: 4
[14:45:27] <Greed> Ah, nevermind then.
[14:45:46] <David_Bradbury> When I stop moving my mouse, the animations become really choppy =/
[14:45:47] <Greed> Firefox 3 always gave me the same issue with jQuery animations.
[14:46:22] <David_Bradbury> Yeah, and if I move my mouse off the screen it stops animating all together
[14:47:00] <fragileninja> Greed: doubt it's the core issue, but you probably want == in that if statement
[14:48:04] <Greed> Good call, fragileninja.
[14:48:05] <Greed> Thanks.
[14:48:16] <fragileninja> np
[14:48:50] <JordiGH> How do I select the first ancestor that matches some selector?
[14:49:11] <tash> n/m my date widget question above, I found the link to it ... however, is there a timepicker?
[14:49:41] <Greed> Still having an issue, so I would assume that it's something on the PHP side of matters.
[14:50:14] <ngharo> ?parent @ JordiGH
[14:50:14] <bot-t> JordiGH, .parent([selector]): Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[14:50:42] <kawohi808> Greed: that easy, eh?
[14:50:52] <djquery> JordiGH: .find('.something:first')
[14:51:17] <Greed> Fairly, kawohi808.
[14:51:29] <djquery> oh you wanted ancestor. well theres also see ?.closest
[14:51:30] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[14:51:42] <JordiGH> djquery: Call find on the dom element I have? But that looks inside it, doesn't it? Not at its parents.
[14:51:58] <rhizmoe> harumph. hi all.
[14:52:02] <JordiGH> Ah, closest.
[14:52:41] <rhizmoe> is there a nice global way to gray-out/disable the control being clicked in an ajax fashion, optionally with spinner? i realize this is probably a 1000x/day type question, and I apologize for that.
[14:53:09] <djquery> JordiGH: $('table').delegate('button.delete', 'click', function(e){  $(this).closest('tr').remove(); });
[14:53:13] <djquery> for example
[14:53:27] <Greed> Holy crap, this channel is flooded with people asking for help.
[14:53:53] <JordiGH> djquery: Yeah, I see.
[14:54:09] <djquery> rhizmoe: got jqueryui loaded?
[14:55:29] <Greed> rhizmoe, $(this).animate() has color animating with jQueryUI.
[14:55:48] <Greed> Or alternatively, you can change opacity using only core functions.
[14:56:05] <falcom> how do i find the FORM of the BUTTON clicked?
[14:56:27] <systemfault> falcom: use .closest('form') or something similar
[14:56:42] <Greed> And to disable it, you can do $("#yourelement").click(function(e){e.preventDefault;} rhizmoe
[14:58:17] <rhizmoe> Greed/djquery: the idea i have in mind (yes i have jqui) is that the spinner goes over "whatever was just clicked," also disabling that control. actually, disabling the control (check_box, etc.) is more important. "click anything, but only once untill success()"
[14:58:33] <rhizmoe> *until
[15:00:42] <rhizmoe> i guess i could add a .singleclick class to any elements I wanted to use for this, tying the behavior to that.
[15:07:29] <bakers> Can someone help me remember that site that lets you give it two (or more) chunks of javascript code and it will benchmark them against each other?
[15:08:52] <craveytrain> bakers: jsperf.com
[15:09:01] <bakers> craveytrain: thanks!
[15:09:56] <falcom> $(button_var).parents('form:first').submit(); // attempting to submit form dynamically
[15:10:06] <falcom> however it doesnt, but no error is reported in the console
[15:10:10] <falcom> of chrome inspector
[15:11:27] <ngharo> console.log your selector
[15:11:36] <ngharo> see if it's valid
[15:13:10] <zeropx> if I use .makeArray how would I turn that array back to an object? I convert in the first place because I wanted to use .reverse()  Here is my pastie code of what I was doing http://pastie.org/2103555
[15:13:26] <dlokshin> exit
[15:14:42] <falcom> ngharo: seem like it works, it return [ <form . .... ]
[15:15:50] <zeropx> never mind figured it out. :D
[15:23:27] <MoTiOnXml> how come i can't bind an event to an iframe.contentDocument in chrome, but in IE it works?
[15:23:49] <MoTiOnXml> i get the object from jquery in chrome, but the event binding just isn't kicking in
[15:36:59] <MoTiOnXml> omg. unbind() with namespaced events is just pure awesome
[15:37:07] <MoTiOnXml> unbind("click.ns");
[15:37:10] <MoTiOnXml> omg!
[15:45:36] <b0c1> Can anybody suggest ajax upload plugin (needed: single click upload, mutiple upload button on same page (not multi file upload))
[15:45:38] <b0c1> ?
[15:51:31] <Jayflux> b0c1 http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#ajaxForm
[15:52:53] <b0c1> Jayflux: nice, but I already have a form and I not want to include...(I see the source it¥s in the upload form)
[15:53:28] <b0c1> so I need a pure ajax solution without html form
[15:53:36] <b0c1> binded to simpe div or anchor
[15:53:43] <Jayflux> download it anyway and see how it works
[15:53:47] <blindMoe> how would the user choose a file?
[15:54:17] <Jayflux> you just attatch it to your form b0c1
[15:54:23] <Jayflux> it doesnt matter if you've already made your form
[15:54:45] <b0c1> Jayflux: but it¥s submitted when I submit the form...
[15:54:54] <b0c1> (and that form is a normal form, not ajax)
[15:55:34] <Jayflux> its a normal form but it doesnt submit, it prevents the default action the uploads the file in the background
[15:55:52] <Vespakoen> Hey guys! I have a div in a div in a div, the deepest div is now $(this), how can i select the get the 2 parents, i dont want to do: $(this).parent().addClass(...).parent().addClass(....) but something like parents(2).addClass() ? sorry if i am vague
[15:55:53] <blindMoe> b0c1: did you search google?  There are a lot of options on there
[15:56:29] <b0c1> blindMoe: I try to search but I not found working...
[15:56:43] <Jayflux> you want to upload a file without refreshing the page or reloading b0c1?
[15:56:55] <blindMoe> http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
[15:57:00] <blindMoe> that seems to work well
[15:57:20] <b0c1> blindMoe: can you bind this to 10 <div>?
[15:57:33] <b0c1> element: $(®.upload®)[0] ?
[15:57:39] <b0c1> or how?
[15:57:55] <Jayflux> b0c1 that is the same as the example i gave you, the only difference is it auto uploads when you selected your file
[15:57:59] <b0c1> Jayflux: fileupload without reload page, but when I submit my form it¥s reload the page
[15:58:22] <Jayflux> b0c1 the example we both gave you does exactly that
[15:58:40] <b0c1> Jayflux: ? I see the ajaxform example and it¥s send the whole form in ajax
[15:59:08] <b0c1> I only want to send the uploaded file in ajax
[15:59:31] <b0c1> (and you can¥t use <form> in <form> )
[15:59:46] <Jayflux> b0c1 you can edit it to how you like, that of course is just an example
[16:00:16] <b0c1> Jayflux: can you show me an example without <form> ?
[16:00:42] <Jayflux> b0c1 you NEED the form element, how else would the user select their file
[16:01:27] <b0c1> Jayflux: but I already have form element with many-many data... and it¥s not submitable when file upload clicked
[16:01:44] <b0c1> you can¥t embed a <form> element into another <form>
[16:01:51] <Jayflux> no why would you need to?
[16:02:18] <Jayflux> what isnt submitable?
[16:02:47] <b0c1> look I have a biiiig form.... which contain 10 image
[16:02:53] <b0c1> the images replaceable by clicks
[16:03:10] <b0c1> but in this time the form not submitable (contains another datas)
[16:07:25] <d4rklit3> hooray for jquery
[16:09:15] <Vespakoen> guys, i have: $('input[name=email]').parents().slice(0, 2).addClass('error'); (2 parent divs get error class) but now i also want an error class on the input itself, is there any way to do it in 1 statement ?
[16:10:25] <Heliodor> Im using $("input#ItemName").val(); to fetch a name from a form string field. But when there's an & sign in the string, the rest of the text is never catched by jquery. How to fix that?
[16:27:51] <Heliodor> Anyone alive? :)
[16:28:17] <Beta2K> I'd guess you have to escape it somehow
[16:28:28] <Beta2K> tho being new to JS and jquery, I don't know how :)
[16:28:30] <Heliodor> Yes, im trying to find something about that, but no luck
[16:28:46] <Heliodor> :-S
[16:28:53] <Heliodor> It sucks being a noob.
[16:28:56] <Beta2K> Know how to show/hide a div on hover?
[16:29:05] <Heliodor> Sure
[16:29:25] <Heliodor> sec
[16:29:46] <Heliodor> http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-en/browse_thread/thread/8d638649cf7fcbea?pli=1
[16:30:22] <Beta2K> Thanks :)
[16:30:38] <MoTiOnXml> how do i in a slick way introduce a check in this statement? this.element.data("content").remove();
[16:30:46] <MoTiOnXml> for no data
[16:31:23] <MoTiOnXml> is there a nicer way than doing (this.element.data("content")) { this.element.data("content").remove(); }
[16:38:18] <Heliodor> Beta2K: I got it, i just needed to use $("input#ItemName").serialize(); instead of $("input#ItemName").val();
[16:39:22] <Beta2K> Heliodor: Makes sense :)
[16:43:52] <Beta2K> Still can't get mine to work, but I don't think it's attaching the function to the elements
[16:44:04] <Beta2K> Other then FF's error console, what can I use to debug JS?
[16:44:15] <Heliodor> Firebug
[16:44:49] <Beta2K> Wait, it works in FF...
[16:44:52] <Heliodor> dont use firequery (firebug addon), it's too confusing for a beginner
[16:44:53] <Beta2K> But not Chrome
[16:45:17] <Heliodor> Hm, do you have a link?
[16:45:23] <darcyclarke> Beta2k you don't want to sue Chrome?
[16:45:39] <Heliodor> you can't sue an app.
[16:45:43] <Heliodor> you mean sue google
[16:45:51] <Beta2K> Heliodor: http://www.parksfurniture.com/damages
[16:46:09] <Beta2K> When you hover the Item S/N or it's input box it should show the div
[16:46:16] <Heliodor>  when i hover the input area the text appears
[16:46:26] <Beta2K> darcyclarke: There are days where I hate chrome :)
[16:46:31] <Heliodor> im using version 12.0.742.100 of chrome
[16:46:40] <Beta2K> Weird, something up with the cache in chrome then maybe
[16:46:41] <darcyclarke> Beta2k and that would be because?
[16:46:53] <vladikoff> it's too fast
[16:46:53] <CrossX> How can I prevent <select> from opening when clicked without disabling.  I want do somthing else when the <select> is clicked.  I'm using FX4.  I tried e.preventDefault() and return false during the onclick event.  Must I use addEventListener?
[16:46:57] <Heliodor> you can add meta-tags on the page so it wont cache
[16:47:12] <Beta2K> Things don't work in it, the fact that I have to tailor to yet another browser/version
[16:47:15] <lith> Motionxml: whats not slick about using if? :)
[16:47:17] <Beta2K> ect
[16:47:26] <Beta2K> Tho I do love that I can play angry Birds in it :)
[16:47:34] <Heliodor> Beta2K: Report the bugs
[16:47:42] <Heliodor> that's the only way it can get better
[16:48:22] <lith> Crossx: you could always hide the select and create whatever interface you want for the select
[16:49:36] <CrossX> lith: Didn't think about hiding the select.  The 'new interface' is already done, I just don't want the select menu to also open
[16:50:37] <lith> CrossX: yeah then have your code update what is selected in the select box. it should still pass data form the form
[16:50:42] <lith> er from the form
[16:54:23] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/1039247
[17:29:56] <bkoltai> Is there an event that fires when selecting an option in a select tag that will set the selected option to "this"
[17:35:42] <zmoazeni> bkoltai: onchange is what you're looking for. You can look for selectedIndex on the select
[17:37:08] <zmoazeni> bkoltai: http://api.jquery.com/change/ is using css to get the selected option
[17:37:32] <bkoltai> zmoazeni: yeah i tried that but it doesn't change the css selected, its only in the html
[17:37:59] <zmoazeni> bkoltai: Want to pastie/gist what you're working with?
[17:39:26] <qcom> anyone want to help me figure out a super mario bros spritely animation?
[17:39:58] <niftylettuce> :last vs last()?
[17:40:06] <niftylettuce> :last not browser friendly?
[17:40:27] <niftylettuce> i guess CSS wise :last makes more sense, but both can achieve the same, so any argument for doing one or other?
[17:40:59] <gnarf> niftylettuce: :last is not a css selector
[17:41:02] <gnarf> ?:last
[17:41:02] <bot-t> :last: Selects the last matched element. http://api.jquery.com/last-selector/
[17:41:15] <gnarf> "Because :last is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using :last cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM querySelectorAll() method. To achieve the best performance when using :last to select elements, first select the elements using a pure CSS selector, then use .filter(":last"). "
[17:41:36] <gnarf> I spent a lot of time writing that line of documentation :)
[17:41:57] <djquery> ?.last
[17:41:58] <bot-t> .last(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set. http://api.jquery.com/last/
[17:42:08] <niftylettuce> gnarf: =) hehe thanks! sorry I should have read down some more!!!
[17:42:12] <gnarf> djquery: yup
[17:42:15] <gnarf> thats the best really
[17:42:26] <gnarf> but that line of doc is reused on all the custom selector extensions
[17:42:35] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/jquery-selector-extensions/
[17:43:14] <niftylettuce> gnarf: so .filter(":last") is much faster than .last() and querySelectorAll() ?
[17:43:56] <gnarf> no
[17:43:59] <gnarf> .last() is faster
[17:44:09] <zmoazeni> bkoltai: https://gist.github.com/e7df4c52b98edf68ee9c should give you the selected index, then you can get the option off of $(this).find("options")[index}
[17:44:15] <gnarf> .eq( -1 ) i think is what .last() calls
[17:44:19] <gnarf> so thats prolly "fastest"
[17:44:42] <palhmbs> I'm having problem with a jquery slideshow in IE9.... http://3sixtynz.com/ --- anyideas for issues with IE9?
[17:44:50] <zmoazeni> This is off the top of my head, so you'll need to play with it/google it
[17:46:20] <bkoltai> zmoazeni: great that is exactly what i was looking for
[17:46:32] <bkoltai> zmoazeni: thanks!
[17:46:42] <zmoazeni> Notta prob
[17:47:29] <palhmbs> funny thing about my problem is that when the IE9 developer toolbar is loaded the probably mysteriously disappears....
[18:06:28] <da-beginner> hi
[18:06:46] <da-beginner> i've got a jquery click event that i need to run after i have run a certain scripts
[18:07:01] <da-beginner> this is the case for the first instance
[18:07:39] <da-beginner> but somehow, on the second instance, the click event runs first, resulting in an error (as the script that was supposed to run before the jquery was executed after)
[18:07:52] <da-beginner> how do i force a re-ordering of the events?
[18:10:57] <palhmbs> ok, i think I've found more info -
[18:11:13] <palhmbs> it looks like one slideshow plugin doesn't like NextGen's Jquery....
[18:13:28] <lex> I want to know how to call this function from within a Jquery click event fleXenv.fleXcrollMain("mycustomscroll"); how do I do this?
[18:16:25] <patzak> how do you capture an event anywhere in the DOM??
[18:17:00] <dxgriffiths> patzak: what are you trying to do?
[18:17:03] <CrossX> patzak: Do you mean a DHTML element?
[18:17:18] <patzak> yes uhm , im trying to overlay keyboard navigation
[18:17:33] <patzak> and i have it set to $(window)
[18:17:40] <patzak> .keydown
[18:17:40] <abjorn> I swear, my personal trainer is a masochist.
[18:17:41] <CrossX> patzak: key events only work on <input> type taks
[18:17:43] <CrossX> tags
[18:18:19] <patzak> ??
[18:18:24] <CrossX> patzak: You'll have to put the user's focus in a <input> element that's rendered offscreen (eg: left:-100px)
[18:18:42] <CrossX> patzak: it can't be hidden or the curosr won't go in it
[18:19:09] <CrossX> patzak: then add a keypress/down/up event to the <input>
[18:19:26] <CrossX> You'll need an event to keep the user's cursor in the input field
[18:19:28] <dxgriffiths> patzak: you can just set an event handler on window or document, it works fine for me.
[18:19:53] <CrossX> dxgriffiths: a keydown event works on the window or document element?
[18:20:17] <dxgriffiths> CrossX: I just tested it then, works fine for me.
[18:20:32] <patzak> it works on the window form e
[18:21:06] <CrossX> I've had difficulty getting that method to work on multiple browsers.  Good luck.
[18:21:10] <patzak> the problem is that my focus is lost due to an ajaxy server clock that reloads an element, thus losing focus from window
[18:21:30] <patzak> errr
[18:21:37] <patzak> so you're saying direct input to an input element huh
[18:22:05] <CrossX> patzak: If you can get it to work the way dxgriffiths describes it's a lot easier
[18:22:27] <CrossX> patzak: I haven't tried in so long, maybe this 'feature' has been added
[18:22:43] <patzak> 0k
[18:22:50] <CrossX> How do I stop <select> from creating a dropdown menu onmousedown without disabling the control?
[18:23:28] <dxgriffiths> patzak, CrossX: according to quirksmode, keyup is the most reliable event to listen for.
[18:24:03] <patzak> ook
[18:24:14] <CrossX> dxgriffiths: each event behaves differently, there isn't really a 'correct' event to use.  Each event behaves a little different in each browser (and each version to an extent).
[18:24:51] <dxgriffiths> CrossX: of course. But cross-browser support is strongest for keyup, according to the table.
[18:25:19] <CrossX> dxgriffiths: If you want to prevent input, keyup wouldn't be usefull.  There are three key events and each has a reason to exist.
[18:26:25] <CrossX> So - anyone have a clue how to prevent the dropdown menu on a <select> from appearing onmousedown?
[18:26:33] <dxgriffiths> CrossX: he's asking about adding keyboard navigation, god.
[18:27:44] <CrossX> Maybe he should use http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/TS/html401/cp0101/0101-ACCESSKEY.html
[18:27:52] <CrossX> seems easier
[18:28:13] <blindMoe> is :not() the oposite of :eq()  ?   Basically.. does :not() work off an index number like :eq() does ?
[18:28:37] <initzero_> CrossX - I'd be surprised if you could find a way to "prevent" the dropdown from appearing... I think that's outside of JavaScripts capabilities
[18:28:39] <dxgriffiths> btw it's kind of annoying to be spoke down to like that, not sure if you were aware that you were stating the obvious but anybody would know that different events have different purposes.
[18:28:46] <initzero_> maybe in HTML5 there is a way
[18:29:16] <CrossX> dxgriffiths: I didn't mean to "speak down" to you
[18:29:30] <blindMoe> do I need to do something like $(img:not(img:eq(1)) to get the opposite of $(img:eq(1))  ?
[18:30:50] <blindMoe> anyone? :)
[18:31:01] <CrossX> All I can think is to place a invisible DIV above the select to intercept the mousedown events.  That should work.  I tried hide, return false, cancelDefault, cancelBubble differnet capture phase, etc..
[18:32:13] <Tobsn> does someone has a good "domain not found" error page?
[18:32:16] <Tobsn> has/knows
[18:36:52] <dxgriffiths> CrossX: preventDefault() didn't work?
[18:37:14] <CrossX> dxgriffiths: no, it didn't work in either phase
[18:37:31] <CrossX> nor did cancelBubble or return false.  I've only tried FF4
[18:37:34] <CrossX> Err FX4
[18:38:04] <initzero_> CrossX - is there a CSS style that can be used?
[18:39:00] <CrossX> initzero_: if you're talking about overlapping another elment ontop of the select, that's what I'm trying now
[18:39:47] <CrossX> Funny thing is, the <select>'s mouse down event fires each time the dropdown menu is pressed down
[18:40:10] <initzero_> I was just wondering if there was some exposed properties of a select that could be used to give the appearsnce that nothing was happening
[18:41:07] <CrossX> initzero_: I don't know of any way to style the dropdown itself.  I tried hiding the <select> element, and it hides, but the dropdown menu _still_ appears.
[18:42:32] <dxgriffiths> CrossX: Yeah it doesn't work in FF but it does in Safari, must be the way FF draws its own controls.
[18:42:57] <CrossX> dxgriffiths: thanks for the xcheck
[18:43:08] <blindMoe> anyone here have much experience with nivoslider and using the beforeChange and afterChange events?  I am trying to fadeOut the current slide in the beforeChange event because my slides have transparent backgrounds and are piling up on top of each other
[18:43:10] <CrossX> dxgriffiths: I guess they should be more verbose in thoes RFCs heh
[18:43:32] <dxgriffiths> CrossX: yup.
[18:43:43] <blindMoe> CrossX: there are a couple jquery plugins for styling dropdowns.. they basically just replace the dropdown with div's that are stylable
[18:44:11] <initzero_> CrossX: here's one http://tutorialzine.com/2010/11/better-select-jquery-css3/
[18:44:37] <CrossX> blindMoe: Thanks for the tip, but that's a little overkill, and it must work in IE6 so I have to write this one by hand.
[18:44:58] <blindMoe> CrossX: not sure why it is overkill.. also not sure that it won't work in IE6
[18:45:40] <dxgriffiths> CrossX: out of curiosity, why would you use a select if you don't want a popup menu?
[18:46:07] <CrossX> blindMoe, well, it's probably more than 3 lines of code, so it's more than I was planning on using to fix this 'bug'.  If I overlay a DIV and use the div's click it should work.
[18:46:42] <CrossX> dxgriffiths: it's a failsafe for people who don't have JS enabled
[18:46:55] <blindMoe> CrossX: that is exactly what I just said ... some people spent the time to wrap it in a quick plugin and already dealt with the variations between browsers
[18:48:13] <CrossX> blindMoe: I just don't like to use plugins, unless it's totaly nessessary.  It's just extra code to maintain worry about, research.  I'm not trying to style the dropdown either, so it is overkill.  I just don't want it to appear.
[18:48:38] <blindMoe> like I said.. they don't style the dropdown.. they use a div and set it over the dropdown so that it degrades properly
[18:49:00] <blindMoe> you can't style dropdowns in almost all browsers since they are system rendered
[18:49:10] <blindMoe> non-modern versions at least
[18:50:47] <CrossX> blindMoe: I guess I just like to understand how every readable line of code works in my stuff.  I'm sort of OCD about adding other people's code, I don't want to if I can avoid it.
[18:51:02] <djquery> blindMoe: sure you can see ?ui.autocomplete
[18:51:03] <bot-t> blindMoe, The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[18:51:08] <blindMoe> whatever floats your boat ;)
[18:51:19] <blindMoe> djquery: huh? :)
[18:51:29] <blindMoe> works for me
[18:51:46] <blindMoe> djquery: are you updating?
[18:51:47] <Tobsn> yeah autocomplete is great
[18:51:49] <Tobsn> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1656816/Screenshots/uqyn.png
[18:52:01] <djquery> <option style="background-color: purple">Purple</option>
[18:52:08] <Tobsn> i built it myself but im going to use the ui plugin
[18:52:11] <dxgriffiths> How can you disable something with JavaScript on a browser with no JavaScript?
[18:52:36] <djquery> Tobsn: like how you are highlighting the text.
[18:52:49] <Tobsn> thats just a regex
[18:53:37] <djquery> Tobsn: makes me not want any vigina though
[18:53:38] <d4rklit3> how do i createa form w/ jquery? could I just do this: var aContainer = $("<form/>", {});
[18:53:43] <Tobsn> yep
[18:53:45] <d4rklit3> and then append inputs to it?
[18:54:07] <djquery> d4rklit3: yeppers
[18:54:10] <CrossX> dxgriffiths: I don't think you can.  I've seen a few pay walls to some very popular news papers wish they could.
[18:54:11] <d4rklit3> doesn't work
[18:54:11] <d4rklit3> :(
[18:54:32] <d4rklit3> var answerOpt = $("<input/>", {"type" : "radio", "value" : "q_"+k, 'html': aText});  those are my radio buttons  $(aContainer).append(answerOpt); appended
[18:54:40] <d4rklit3> they don't behave as all part of the same for
[18:54:41] <d4rklit3> m
[18:54:53] <Tobsn> d4rklit3, you can also create inputs and wrap() them with <form>
[18:55:39] <d4rklit3> $(answerOpt).wrap(answerOpt);  ?
[18:55:50] <d4rklit3> errr  	$(answerOpt).wrap(aContainer);
[18:55:58] <Tobsn> yep
[18:56:01] <Tobsn> i think
[18:56:03] <Tobsn> :D
[18:56:06] <Tobsn> just try it
[18:56:14] <d4rklit3> no
[18:56:22] <d4rklit3> that doesn't work, they are being generated in a .each
[18:56:41] <Tobsn> i use it with lists like that: $.tmpl( 'suggest', suggestions ).appendTo('div#suggest').wrap('<ul>');
[18:56:57] <d4rklit3> im trying to append them to this form element but they don't switch between eachother :(
[18:57:00] <d4rklit3> they display
[18:57:24] <Tobsn> use jsfiddle to show how you do it
[18:57:42] <dxgriffiths> d4rklit3: you have to set the name of them all to be the same so the browser knows to group them.
[18:57:48] <d4rklit3> doh
[18:58:02] <lathan> hate those *faceplant* mistakes
[18:58:25] <djquery> d4rklit3: did you give them a name
[18:58:38] <djquery> somebody beat me to it
[18:59:39] <Beta2K> Anyone around mind looking at this, http://pastebin.com/ZNC79jWG, the function checkInvKey() fires on page load for some reason, and won't fire when I move off the .hover element
[19:01:06] <ryanseddon> Beta2K: drop the () after the function that is whats executing it
[19:05:05] <Beta2K> ryanseddon: Thanks :)
[19:05:35] <ryanseddon> np
[19:16:18] <krainboltgreene> Straaaange. I get an infinite loop *only* on minified JQuery. That can't be right, can it?
[19:19:13] <d4rklit3> waht does minified mean
[19:19:14] <d4rklit3> ?
[19:19:22] <d4rklit3> is that when they remove the white space from js
[19:19:33] <system68> pretty much
[19:19:38] <d4rklit3> fuck minification
[19:19:41] <d4rklit3> fuck it in the ass
[19:19:42] <system68> and when multiple files are added together
[19:19:55] <d4rklit3> makes debugging errors impossible
[19:20:07] <system68> it helps for production sites
[19:20:10] <CrossX> d4rklit3: makes the physical file size smaller.
[19:20:12] <system68> shouldn't be used for development
[19:20:14] <ryanseddon> you can always beautify the code, chrome has it built in now
[19:20:20] <d4rklit3> oo
[19:20:21] <system68> look at HTML5 boilderplate
[19:20:21] <d4rklit3> sexy
[19:20:27] <system68> er... boilerplate
[19:20:29] <d4rklit3> ok
[19:20:34] <d4rklit3> i gotta go
[19:20:43] <d4rklit3> mb some russian roulette tonight
[19:21:04] <system68> I have a troublesome question involving jQuery autocomplete
[19:21:23] <CrossX> d4rklit3: Is that where you randomly pull HD's and see if their raid controlers work
[19:22:13] <d4rklit3> CrossX: actually thats not far off from what im gonna do tonight
[19:22:24] <d4rklit3> haha thanks for mentioning or i would have left this SSD at work
[19:24:37] <choobin_> v
[19:25:23] <krainboltgreene> Compressed, specifically.
[19:25:26] <krainboltgreene> Not minified.
[19:25:34] <system68> I use ajax to populate my source based on city name.. which works great.  I return the results as a string like City, State, Country.. I fetch the array based on the city.. but when it get's to the comma between city and state it fails to produce a result (as I'm querying the database based on city).  This causes problems for popular north american city names, like Richmond.. what I am trying to do is have autocomplete use the return array for 
[19:25:36] <krainboltgreene> Doesn't loop with non-compressed.
[20:05:50] <system68> is there a way to filter jquery autocomplete results based on an array and the request in a source callback function?
[20:07:30] <djquery> system68: $.ui.autocomple.filter = function(
[20:08:40] <system68> djquery: thanks!
[20:09:06] <djquery> system68: you might wanna lookat the one thats there allready
[20:10:06] <system68> djquery: I saw it, just wasn't sure how to use it.  I only want to invoke it when my ajax request fails to return a result
[20:10:33] <djquery> system69 then thats not it
[20:15:14] <system68> djquery: if I have a stored global array with data, and a request, can I use the filter within the custom callback function?  something like response($.ui.autocomplete.filter(myStoredArray, request)); ?
[20:16:26] <djquery> think that the filter that it uses when showing items. unless u are using one of the caching techniques it will probably never call the filter when doing ajax
[20:16:41] <djquery> it expects the items to be filtered allready
[20:21:01] <escapedcat> hi
[20:22:40] <alystair> why is offsetY/X not set within Firefox :S
[20:22:44] <alystair> when an event is done
[20:24:30] <Pierro> hello
[20:24:35] <Pierro>  ihave a big problem but i think it's easy to solve
[20:24:40] <alystair> I can do event.clientX-event.currentTarget.offsetLeft and that basically gets me the same number?
[20:24:48] <Pierro> programation is not my things ^^;
[20:24:52] <Pierro> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/not-solved-link-from-a-complete-single-page-to-a-local-internal-linked-pages-urgent
[20:24:58] <Pierro> if someone have any idea
[20:25:11] <system68> djquery: Thanks again for your help.  Worked great.
[20:26:16] <alystair> hrm looks like layerX and offsetX are exact same thing
[20:28:32] <GuiriVerde> Hi, I'm using the Jquery template plugin, and wondering if there is an index variable which will increment with each template created? I have seen ${$index} on some pages but doesn't seem to work for me
[20:30:35] <GuiriVerde> Would be nice not to have to increment through the data to add an extra 'index' variable
[20:30:45] <GuiriVerde> (manually I mean)
[20:31:59] <djquery> what do you need an index for/
[20:32:12] <djquery> ?tmplItem
[20:32:18] <bot-t> djquery, .tmplItem() - Return the tmplItem data structure for the rendered template that the matched element is part of. http://api.jquery.com/tmplitem/
[20:36:12] <GuiriVerde> I wanted to add incrementing id attributes
[20:37:09] <GuiriVerde>  .tmplItem() ... from a quick glance seems for after the element is added, I was hoping just to add something (simple) in the template
[20:38:13] <djquery> GuiriVerde: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3895329/simplest-way-to-get-current-item-index-within-jquery-template
[20:38:39] <djquery> GuiriVerde: or just dont use ids
[20:42:36] <fr0stbyte> are there any good plugins for displaying a visual console on a webpage? preferably UI widget
[20:42:51] <djquery> que?
[20:43:28] <JordiGH> fr0stbyte: uni.xkcd.com
[20:45:06] <GuiriVerde> @djquery not quite as clean & simple as I'd hoped, but looks just the ticket, cheers
[20:45:32] <JordiGH> @djquery lol #fail
[20:45:36] <djquery> GuiriVerde: google is your friend see ?google jquery tmpl index
[20:45:37] <bot-t> GuiriVerde, jQuery.tmpl() ñ jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/
[20:46:16] <djquery> GuiriVerde: the function method wasnt that bad
[20:47:44] <GuiriVerde> aha, I was coding using jQuery.template as a reference instead of tmpl which doesn't have any comments
[20:48:35] <GuiriVerde> is it better to do it this way than iterate through the data adding an index?
[20:49:22] <GuiriVerde> anyways, does the job, off to use it cheers
[20:49:36] <djquery> GuiriVerde: some good stuff here http://jquery.github.com/jquery-tmpl/demos/step-by-step.html  http://www.borismoore.com/2011/04/jquery-bay-area-conference-presentation.html
[20:54:13] <niftylettuce> is there such thing as var obj = [{color:"red",fruit:"orange"},{color:"green",fruit:"apple"}]; obj.sort(obj.color, "asc"); ???
[20:54:40] <djquery> niftylettuce: yes there is
[20:55:08] <djquery> sort accepts a function that returns a true false
[20:55:34] <niftylettuce> djquery: do you have an example? I can't find a simple one
[20:56:05] <djquery> niftylettuce: google has a whole bunch see ?g javascript sort array of objects
[20:56:06] <bot-t> niftylettuce, Javascript Sorting an Array of Objects - http://www.webdotdev.com/nvd/content/view/878/
[20:56:08] <gnarf> obj.sort(function(a,b) { return a.color > b.color ? 1 : a.color < b.color ? -1 : 0 ; });
[20:56:41] <gnarf> ?js var obj = [{color:"red",fruit:"orange"},{color:"green",fruit:"apple"}]; obj.sort(function(a,b) { return a.color > b.color ? 1 : a.color < b.color ? -1 : 0 ; }); console.log( obj );
[20:56:42] <bot-t> gnarf: [{"color": "green", "fruit": "apple"}, {"color": "red", "fruit": "orange"}]
[20:56:50] <niftylettuce> also what are your views on <table> vs <div> for displaying rows/columns
[20:57:00] <niftylettuce> display: table-cell vs <td> ?
[20:57:08] <gnarf> niftylettuce: tabular data belongs in a table
[20:57:10] <djquery> that tables are good for displaying tabular data
[20:57:35] <djquery> tables are the slowest rendering element by the way
[20:57:57] <niftylettuce> djquery: ty i was going to ask performance wise :)
[20:58:32] <djquery> niftylettuce: it has to wait for the entire table to load before it can start to calculate the widths and heights
[20:59:22] <niftylettuce> djquery: you aren't suggesting that the use of CSS display: table-cell; will also decrease performance?
[20:59:43] <djquery> niftylettuce: dont know that would make a good test
[21:00:03] <niftylettuce> djquery: i'll run a test right now, you recommend using google DOM?
[21:00:06] <niftylettuce> inspector**?
[21:00:17] <djquery> havent looked at it
[21:05:45] <escapedcat> hi, anyone here?
[21:06:11] <T-Gunn> with the $this->Form->input() it creates a div that surrounds the input, of course, i want to put some extra text to appear in smaller lettering next to it... just putting it on the next line doesnt alow me to do this... is there a way to do this or do i have to manually put in the html for the input box?
[21:06:31] <escapedcat> did someone experiencing problems with the latest 1.6.1 and the body backgroudn color in ie8?
[21:06:31] <T-Gunn> oops
[21:06:34] <T-Gunn> wrong channel
[21:06:35] <escapedcat> http://pastebin.com/GRAtGDeJ
[21:07:20] <escapedcat> would be great if someone could confirm the bug in ie8. it doesn't take much time
[21:07:27] <gnarf> djquery: did you see http://gnarf.net/2011/06/21/jquery-ajaxqueue/ btw?
[21:07:41] <gnarf> i know you like seein random stuff like that :)
[21:08:02] <chrisdtwg> hello
[21:08:32] <chrisdtwg> i have a quick jquery question, i just built this page and for some reason i can't get the current button state to change
[21:08:33] <chrisdtwg> http://www.thewinngroup.net/Client/Gospel_Music_Channel/Media/AmericaSings/AmericaSingsWebpageTest.html
[21:09:49] <chrisdtwg> anyone here?
[21:09:51] <Z3R0> no
[21:10:11] <chrisdtwg> I have a quick jquery question...am i in the right place?
[21:10:15] <gnarf> its IRC man, what are you expecting, instant gratification?
[21:10:32] <chrisdtwg> yes...that would be great
[21:10:41] <chrisdtwg> gnaft: can you help me?
[21:10:57] <gnarf> That depends on how well you can explain what you mean by "current button state to change"
[21:11:30] <^zoggy^> anyone use the jquery autocomplete? how do you make it bold the search/match term?
[21:11:34] <buzzman> how to detect if a lightbox is popped open on a page? this doesn't cut it:  if ($('#lightbox').length != 0)   cuz the lightbox jQuery code generates the lightbox div and so it's not in the page html ...
[21:11:36] <djquery> gnarf: no I hadnt and I thought I had subscribed to that
[21:11:47] <chrisdtwg> gnarf: when you click a different episode, the selected button should change color and the previous button should return to normal
[21:11:49] <^zoggy^> escapedcat, tried clearing cache?
[21:11:53] <gnarf> djquery: i pasted the gist earlier
[21:11:57] <gnarf> didn't know if you followed it :)
[21:12:12] <escapedcat> ^zoggy^, wait a moment
[21:12:16] <djquery> gnarf: evidently I dont
[21:12:39] <buzzman> djquery: hi djquery
[21:12:45] <gnarf> well chrisdtwg - you're making it harder on yourself by using img tags
[21:12:52] <escapedcat> ^zoggy^, yes, still blank. did you see my example?
[21:12:56] <gnarf> you'd be better off using a background image
[21:13:00] <gnarf> and having a class
[21:13:18] <gnarf> that offsets the background position
[21:13:25] <gnarf> but
[21:13:41] <gnarf> or
[21:13:45] <gnarf> if you just didn't use images
[21:13:56] <gnarf> instead, relied on the boxes and standard html text to denter that
[21:13:58] <djquery> gnarf: have you listed yourself on here? http://www.jquerybloggers.com/
[21:14:04] <gnarf> djquery: nope
[21:14:13] <djquery> coulda sworn I saw the color one
[21:14:17] <escapedcat> ^zoggy^, or was that a joke like 'have you tried truning it off and on again?' :)
[21:14:25] <gnarf> djquery: that was on the official
[21:14:32] <gnarf> djquery: i cross posted it to my blog
[21:15:12] <chrisdtwg> gnarf: thanks for your help...could you point me to an example? i'm trying my hardest to figure this stuff out and you're the first person that seems to know what you're talking about
[21:16:33] <^zoggy^> escapedcat, why not put that source as a live example on: http://jsfiddle.net
[21:17:20] <escapedcat> ^zoggy^, let me try

[21:21:11] <escapedcat> ^zoggy^, http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9606
[21:21:25] <escapedcat> ^zoggy^, someone opened up a ticket
[21:21:39] <da-beginner> hi
[21:21:50] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/NwTYd/ @chrisdtwg
[21:22:02] <da-beginner> i've got two javascript files, each attach a click event to this one button
[21:22:27] <da-beginner> how do i make sure that one script from one file is executed first prior to the other script on another file?
[21:23:05] <da-beginner> i just want to change the second file, if that's possible
[21:23:35] <da-beginner> i tried bind() and unbind() on the second file in the hopes of re-ordering the execution queue, but no luck
[21:23:36] <djquery> <ul id="epsidoemenu"><li><a href="/episodes/1">Episode 1</a></li></ul>     $('epsidoemenu').delegate('li', 'click', function(){  var $this = $(this); $this.siblings('.active').removeClass('.active'); $this.addClass('.active')  });
[21:23:46] <djquery> chrisdtwg: ^^^^^^^^^^^
[21:24:00] <chrisdtwg> gnarf: thanks for you
[21:25:24] <djquery> chrisdtwg: where you have a css class that sets the background color    #epsidoement li {background-color: blue;}  #episodemenu li.active { background-color: red;}
[21:25:59] <escapedcat> ^zoggy^, i did a lot of googling before i came here... somehow the bugtracker of jquery doesn't get ranked so good... found several tickets no. it's will be fixed in 1.6.2
[21:26:11] <escapedcat> ...now...
[21:26:14] <da-beginner> help!
[21:26:56] <Cork> da-beginner: use name scopes
[21:26:57] <pixeltarian> total newb question. I haven't used javascript or jquery that much, and the documentation and tutorials I've found are a not ultra conducive to how I learn things. I need to know what every character does and go from there. is there an place where I can just see ".,{}()" etc (the non word bits) and have them explained to me?
[21:27:29] <pixeltarian> words are easy for me to remember but not sytax symbols
[21:27:38] <Cork> da-beginner: bind('click.my-name-scope') unbind('.my-name-scope') or unbind('click.my-name-scope')
[21:27:46] <ryanseddon> programming is not for you then

[21:39:45] <gnarf> its not passed to the server
[21:39:50] <Z3R0> ah
[21:40:01] <Z3R0> makes sense nvm
[21:40:07] <Z3R0> i'm tired haha
[21:42:21] <gnarf> djquery: did you ever see $.fn.newContent ? https://gist.github.com/1003630
[21:43:41] <Cluber> $(document).ready(function() { $("#BioText").val('test'); }); why isn't this setting the text of my <div id="BioText"></div>
[21:44:03] <djquery> gnarf: that kinda like livequery
[21:44:17] <gnarf> djquery: except explicit instead of implicit
[21:44:25] <gnarf> and not using a setInterval polling loop
[21:44:26] <gnarf> :)
[21:44:45] <djquery> gnarf: dont think the newest version of livequery uses that
[21:45:09] <djquery> hows it work on crap6?
[21:45:13] <djquery> err ie6
[21:45:21] <gnarf> what?
[21:45:29] <gnarf> newContent?
[21:45:37] <djquery> yeah
[21:45:40] <gnarf> it is totally non-specific to any browser, it just works
[21:46:01] <gnarf> you explicitly call .newContent() on new content....
[21:46:10] <gnarf> and it loops through the handlers bound
[21:46:43] <djquery> gnarf: didnt we work on that function that used <input data-ui-datapicker='{}'
[21:46:55] <gnarf> yeah
[21:47:41] <Cluber> anyone got any idea, really annoying me
[21:47:46] <lazyPower> I have an array of objects, like so http://pastebin.com/ywZ48TBE -- and I need to search them for a given index so i can pull some of the properties.  $.inArray() always returns -1, is there another method I could use to search the given object for a particular attributes value?
[21:48:07] <djquery> Cluber: I got a lot of realy annoying ideas
[21:49:02] <gnarf> ?text @Cluber
[21:49:02] <bot-t> Cluber, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[21:49:09] <gnarf> .val() is for inputs

[21:49:44] <Cluber> ahh
[21:49:47] <Cluber> thanks!
[21:50:09] <djquery> Cluber: see .html as well see ?.html
[21:50:10] <bot-t> Cluber, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[21:50:45] <heshanh> is there a way i can change a property inside a style?
[21:51:00] <systemfault> lazyPower: use .grep (I know.. shitty name)
[21:51:34] <systemfault> (If you don't care about the index)
[21:51:55] <Cluber> i must say, i do like jquery
[21:52:32] <lazyPower> I read that has a huge performance hit on large data structures. I also need the index of the value -- as i need to pull the remaining object properties into other dom elements.  (the full size of the object array is > 2000 records)
[21:52:57] <djquery> lazyPower: see ?.map
[21:52:58] <bot-t> lazyPower, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[21:53:46] <lazyPower> Excellent, Thanks djquery i'll give this a go
[21:53:51] <djquery> lazyPower: or just loop over them so that you can escape outa the loop once you find the one that you are looking for. then u will have the index
[21:54:03] <systemfault> lazyPower: Any function with callback is going to have a performance impact on a big collection..
[21:54:25] <djquery> lazyPower: any other method is gonna loop over every object till the end
[21:55:07] <lazyPower> ah ok, so i'm already on the right path then where i was headed
[21:58:25] <djquery> function getIndex(array, prop, text){  var x = -1;  for(int 1=0, i<array.lenght; i++){  if(array[i][prop] == text){ x=i; break; }  }   return x; }
[21:58:43] <djquery> lazyPower: or something like that ^^^^^^^^^^^
[21:59:19] <systemfault> length :P Not lenght
[21:59:24] <systemfault> j/k
[21:59:37] <lazyPower> djquery: what i did was similar. Instead of returning the index i used I and set the required DOM values while inside the array, then escaped.
[21:59:56] <djquery> hmmm nevermind try this instead function getIndex(array, prop, text){ for(int 1=0, i<array.lengtj; i++){  if(array[i][prop] == text){return x; }  }   return x; }
[21:59:56] <lazyPower> my capital and lower case i's got switched.
[22:00:10] <djquery> damn I cant type today
[22:00:15] <djquery> u get the idear
[22:00:19] <lazyPower> yessir
[22:00:55] <Pierro> Big problem guys ;_; https://forum.jquery.com/topic/not-solved-link-from-a-complete-single-page-to-a-local-internal-linked-pages-urgent
[22:01:01] <djquery> function getIndex(array, prop, text){ for(int 1=0, i<array.length; i++){  if(array[i][prop] == text){return 1; }  }   return -1; }
[22:01:16] <lazyPower> djquery: http://pastebin.com/tqV3Gyxq -- that is what i have in place -- without the escape
[22:01:53] <buzzman> djquery:  i tried the :visible selector, but it still doesn't catch if the lightbox is popped open ... :-(
[22:02:38] <djquery> lazyPower: cache $('#poi').val()  instead of calling it for each loop
[22:02:54] <lazyPower> ok
[22:03:13] <systemfault> djquery: Haha, I thought the same..
[22:03:58] <markl_____> hrm....  any way I can debug why some $(document).ready(function().... don't seem to be being applied?
[22:03:59] <systemfault> Funny how people say they care about performance when they're doing such naive things..
[22:04:03] <djquery> and put a break in your 2nd if so it doesnt keep going through the loop after it has found it
[22:04:05] <markl_____> I assume I can use multiple ready's ?
[22:04:14] <systemfault> markl_____: Use console.log
[22:04:19] <systemfault> markl_____: Yeah. sure.
[22:06:45] <heshanh> guys ive got a html code <form> ... </form><div></div>, how do i move that form tag so its after the div tag?
[22:07:12] <Z3R0> <div></div><form>...</form>
[22:07:26] <markl_____> hrmmm, so just throw the 4 line 'jQuery.fn.log = ...' in my <head> and then throw .log('blah') somewhere in the ready call?
[22:07:30] <djquery> gnarf: you see this? http://jsbin.tumblr.com/post/6753388869/introducing-js-bin-2-8-0-with-live-previews
[22:08:15] <djquery> heshanh: $('div.mydiv').insertBefore('form')
[22:12:22] <Z3R0> whoa... what happened?
[22:13:56] <Z3R0> lol everyone using webchat.freenode.net just got K-Lined haha
[22:14:56] <systemfault> Good for them.
[22:15:02] <systemfault> Get a REAL client FFS.
[22:15:17] <djquery> ?w ffs
[22:15:19] <bot-t> djquery, FFS - FFS can stand for: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFS
[22:16:00] <systemfault> djquery: Last one in the "general" section.
[22:16:21] <djquery> systemfault: I thought you were going for the first one in the same
[22:16:32] <systemfault> Haha
[22:16:49] <djquery> systemfault: think you get a rinestone glove free with that
[22:17:01] <systemfault> Cool!
[22:17:02] <systemfault> :P
[22:17:04] <markl_____> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/EVZCH/  - can you spot why they'd be different?
[22:17:27] <djquery> which one of these things aint like the other
[22:17:40] <markl_____> the checkbox bit works fine... but my other buttons don't alert at all.  they are just doing the default browser submit.
[22:17:54] <markl_____> there is no event attached to them..
[22:18:20] <markl_____> (and I'm not sure how to work the log() thing)...  (only started playing with jquery 2 days ago)
[22:18:36] <systemfault> Never heard about jQuery.log :/
[22:19:22] <markl_____> oh - I thought that was what you meant.. that was the first hit when I googled 'jquery console.log'
[22:19:31] <djquery> markl_____: http://which-should-i-use.ossreleasefeed.com/
[22:19:50] <djquery> markl_____: think they ment console.log not $.log
[22:20:06] <djquery> markl_____: type checked intot he box in the url I sent
[22:20:11] <systemfault> Haha, funny URL
[22:21:53] <systemfault> The rule is simple.. no need for a dedicated website :P
[22:22:17] <djquery> systemfault: I didnt make it
[22:22:48] <systemfault> Ah :P
[22:23:33] <djquery> markl_____: see ?:checkbox
[22:23:34] <bot-t> markl_____, :checkbox: Selects all elements of type checkbox. http://api.jquery.com/checkbox-selector/
[22:23:44] <buzzman> djquery: sry, i got disconnected from the server and couldn't log back in ... until now ... did i miss any of ur msg since I left a msg for you that the :visible selector didn't work ... ?
[22:23:50] <markl_____> the checkbox thing is working
[22:23:53] <djquery> markl_____: rather see ?:checked
[22:23:54] <bot-t> markl_____, :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[22:24:12] <markl_____> its the other one - setting event on a button
[22:24:20] <djquery> buzzman: nope I am outa idears
[22:24:47] <markl_____> I want to point to a load() function that I already have that works... but am just trying to test it at the moment to alert
[22:24:55] <markl_____> but browser is just doing a dumb submit
[22:24:56] <buzzman> djquery: what do i do now ... ? :-(
[22:25:41] <djquery> ?tell buzzman get a real irc client for starters?
[22:25:41] <bot-t> djquery, Okay.
[22:27:59] <djquery> markl_____: well instead of using inline javascript replace all of those updatedomainlist with one see ?.live
[22:28:00] <bot-t> markl_____, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[22:29:33] <djquery> ?tell buzzman go look at the docs on the lightbox site and see if it has a method that tells u whether its visisble or not
[22:29:34] <bot-t> djquery, Okay.
[22:32:23] <markl_____> djquery: thanks
[22:32:57] <markl_____> but that stuff is working at the moment..  I can shrink/optimize later..  I just can't work out why my button click isn't being taken over
[22:33:29] <djquery> whats the id of the button thats not workin
[22:33:29] <Z3R0> ?
[22:33:38] <djquery> markl_____: ^
[22:34:08] <djquery> and why is prepagebutton in a th>
[22:34:22] <markl_____> its in a table

[22:42:06] <markl_____> fml - I think I worked it out...  it must be where I am adding the javascript into my output;
[22:42:32] <markl_____> I had all the document readys at the bottom of the body but I guess it doesn't like that
[22:46:08] <markl_____> thanks djquery..
[22:51:49] <Tobsn> does anyone use jquery bbq? i dont fully understand the push state thing
[23:00:22] <buzzman> djquery: if i'm getting repeatedly disconnected from this server, where do i report the problem ... ?
[23:00:22] <bot-t> (34 mins 40 secs ago) <djquery> tell buzzman get a real irc client for starters?
[23:00:23] <bot-t> (30 mins 40 secs ago) <djquery> tell buzzman go look at the docs on the lightbox site and see if it has a method that tells u whether its visisble or not
[23:02:12] <djquery> buzzman: that answer ur Q?
[23:03:20] <djquery> markl_____: it can handle multiple .ready just fine.
[23:03:37] <buzzman> djquery: hmm, i guess ... thnx ... not @ my own comp ... thats why using webchat ... and the lightbox is an implementation in drupal ... so it gets a little knotty there ... :-(
[23:07:10] <buzzman> djquery:  the reason i asked here is the lightbox is still implemented as a jQuery Lightbox ... should I post the lightbox jQ code in jsfiddle for u to see ... ?
[23:07:51] <djquery> buzzman: or in a jsbin they have made huge improvements
[23:09:07] <buzzman> djquery:  yes on jsbin now ... ok thnx for sharing that ... uploading code there ...
[23:09:49] <djquery> buzzman: if jsbin would impliment logins so that I could have a list of all my fiddles I would switch permately
[23:10:39] <kawohi808> anybody use fancybox in here?
[23:11:00] <buzzman> djquery:  yea, that sounds good ... maybe they will do it if there is enuf requests ...
[23:12:12] <coldhead> jsbin is probably simpler for the noobs except it doesn't seem to let you easily add jQuery?
[23:12:50] <coldhead> oh that would be the big obvious INCLUDE bit up the top
[23:12:56] <coldhead> stupidest coldhead ever
[23:13:30] <coldhead> thanks mentioning it, djquery
[23:16:05] <kawohi808> i'm trying to load forms via ajax in different lightboxes.. [clicking button launches a different lightbox/form' how can I do this? I got by clicking a link the forms load, but not <button>
[23:17:12] <kawohi808> fancybox
[23:17:31] <kawohi808> help please, im so tired >:|
[23:18:31] <escapedcat> kawohi808, why would it be better, to have a button? just asking to find out, what you really want
[23:19:21] <kawohi808> well, I geuss I can change it to a link
[23:19:27] <kawohi808> but will that really work?
[23:21:17] <coldhead> "i'm like the male justin bieber"
[23:21:28] <juha___> morning ppl
[23:22:00] <escapedcat> kawohi808, hm, i guess, i don't get your problem, sry
[23:22:12] <coldhead> terve, juha___
[23:22:17] <kawohi808> how about if i show it live?
[23:22:50] <escapedcat> kawohi808, i guess that would help :) possible to reduce it so you can use jsfiddle.net?
[23:23:10] <juha___> TERVE
[23:23:19] <kawohi808> well i was thinking more of dropbox. since the ajax can actually work
[23:24:04] <escapedcat> kawohi808, i understand... sry, don't have enough time for this right now.
[23:24:16] <kawohi808> ah ok.
[23:24:34] <Z3R0> what you trying to do Kaapa?
[23:24:37] <Z3R0> ack kawohi808 ?
[23:24:51] <coldhead> dropbox would be fine, kawohi808
[23:25:07] <coldhead> a working demo is a working demo
[23:25:15] <coldhead> escapedcat is such a quitter
[23:25:39] <lazyPower> Did i manage to paste flood or something? I got k-lined without realizing what happened.
[23:25:51] <Z3R0> all webchat clients got k-lined
[23:25:57] <lazyPower> ah ok
[23:25:58] <kawohi808> Ok 1 second please.
[23:26:04] <coldhead> lol freenode
[23:26:09] <lazyPower> I thought i did something stupid there for a minute.
[23:26:20] <Z3R0> some room the support people had hidden, someone found it, and passed it around, once a webchat guy hit it, the entire domain was k-lined
[23:26:21] <coldhead> you conscientious fellow
[23:26:27] <escapedcat> coldhead, should have jerked off before entering irc... darn
[23:26:36] <coldhead> you should have stormed #frreenode and gone MAN WHY THE FUCK
[23:26:37] <juha___> i hate when sites bind to scrollwheel click and my browser doesn't open new tab
[23:26:43] <Z3R0> everyone did...
[23:26:48] <Z3R0> I'm in there now...
[23:26:58] <Z3R0> although it was because the guy I was talking to was on webchat lol
[23:27:01] <kawohi808> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31659128/spyi/spyeye/index.html
[23:27:24] <kawohi808> click this shows data...form pops up....
[23:27:31] <kawohi808> but I need the buttons to pop up
[23:27:43] <kawohi808> to click and the fancybox to ppop up
[23:27:49] <kawohi808> sorry i'm barely awake
[23:28:06] <lazyPower> kawohi808: early morning? or long night?
[23:28:26] <kawohi808> long night.. trying to get this done so my "baby mama" stops fussing at me :/
[23:29:20] <Z3R0> what's teh problem ?
[23:29:49] <kawohi808> well im trying to load the lightbox with a different form in each button. where you see 'buy now'
[23:30:38] <kawohi808> But nothing works. I got the lightbox appear first time, but it says "couldn't load", so I guess i'm trying to load each different form with ajax
[23:31:22] <Z3R0> what thell is fancbox ?
[23:32:28] <kawohi808> click the "this shows content link.." and a overlay box appears... -_-
[23:32:32] <Z3R0> you don't have any click events attached to your buttons...
[23:33:14] <coldhead> if we're talking about the same buttons you are, kawohi808, yeah, no handlers are bound
[23:33:17] <Z3R0> <button id="but200"></button> $('but200').click(function() { // stuff });
[23:33:47] <Z3R0> <button id="but500"></button> $('but500').click(function() { // stuff });
[23:33:59] <coldhead> $('#but...')*
[23:34:04] <Z3R0> right lol
[23:34:06] <coldhead> lol but
[23:34:12] <Z3R0> #but200 #but500
[23:34:31] <coldhead> #but500 is for people who prefer bigger butts
[23:34:36] <pratz> hey guys what is the best popup / dialog box you would suggest, i just want 2-4 fields in that popup box and it will be used in many places ??
[23:34:54] <coldhead> ?modal @ pratz
[23:34:54] <bot-t> pratz, There are a number of excellent modal plugins for jQuery, including Colorbox (http://colorpowered.com/colorbox/) and jQuery UI Dialog (http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/). Want more? http://planetozh.com/projects/lightbox-clones/. Just don't use Thickbox, for your own sake! The BlockUI plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/block/) can also be useful in providing modality.
[23:35:10] <coldhead> it's a bit of a holy war, babe
[23:35:26] <coldhead> i personally like boxy but it's not even on the list
[23:35:30] <Z3R0> so far that fancy box totally caught my eye...
[23:35:32] <Z3R0> that's awesome
[23:35:54] <Z3R0> so it's an overlaying div? not an actual popup ?
[23:36:18] <kawohi808> well im using fancybox and its really easy to use
[23:36:25] <Z3R0> it's just an overlaying div right?
[23:36:39] <kawohi808> in firebug is shows a lot of nested divs and spans
[23:36:51] <Z3R0> ya I see that
[23:37:03] <kawohi808> but to get it to work is 2 lines of html
[23:37:12] <Z3R0> of jquery
[23:37:14] <Z3R0> not html
[23:37:54] <Z3R0> are you wanting the content to be in the fancybox from the buttons?
[23:38:36] <Z3R0> because you could have the buttons load the fancybox form, and then auto select the correct values for the form ^_^
[23:39:18] <Z3R0> I am totally loving that fancy box lol...
[23:39:22] <kawohi808> OMG
[23:39:25] <Z3R0> I keep clicking it just to see it in action
[23:39:27] <kawohi808> ok i got it
[23:39:40] <kawohi808> but its only 1 form. I need to get the other form to work too.
[23:39:48] <Z3R0> what other form ?
[23:40:03] <Z3R0> you have one form - two options, auto select the option
[23:40:41] <kawohi808> theres 2 buttons tho. i got 1 to work. but theres another form that has the 2nd option. i know, but its what the client wanted.
[23:40:48] <kawohi808> so the content loads in <div style="display:none"><div id="data">
[23:40:54] <Z3R0> but it's the same damn thing
[23:41:04] <kawohi808> and I have $('#data').load('form1.html');
[23:41:09] <kawohi808> so how do I get that to work
[23:41:28] <kawohi808> the 2nd one has a different value in the dropdown box
[23:42:09] <Z3R0> $('#but200').click(function() { $('#data').load('form1.html).show(); } ?
[23:42:22] <iszak> coldhead, I've got something for you!
[23:43:09] <kawohi808> how about  $('#data:first').load('form2.html'); ? .... ill try that and if that don't work ill try yours
[23:44:22] <kawohi808> would .load(form1.html, #form1') (if thats how you do it) loose the css styling from that page?
[23:45:01] <coldhead> gimme dat, iszak
[23:45:29] <iszak> coldhead, http://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/montage/main.htm
[23:45:44] <iszak> coldhead, now you can make any type of porn you want!
[23:46:06] <iszak> rule 34 comes into effect
[23:46:24] <coldhead> hahahahahahahaha omg
[23:47:12] <Z3R0> that's really awesome
[23:47:23] <iszak> oi! that link wasn't for you! immediately unsee it.
[23:47:37] <coldhead> they have such good examples
[23:47:52] <coldhead> cheeta, moto rider, desert
[23:47:52] <iszak> I know, although that cheetah one is kind of dodgy.
[23:47:54] <coldhead> perfect
[23:47:57] <coldhead> hahahaha
[23:48:17] <iszak> it doesn't look like desert, looks like a dirty track
[23:49:31] <Z3R0> any luck kawohi808?
[23:50:08] <iszak> coldhead, anyhow, you like? D:
[23:52:39] <coldhead> very much, iszak
[23:52:51] <coldhead> mild headache trying to understand how it works
[23:57:47] <coldhead> guess kawohi808 succumbed to the baby mamma
[23:58:19] <kawohi808> still not working... i updated the live.... the fancybox works, except its not going to the second form on the 2nd button http://dl.dropbox.com/u/31659128/spyi/spyeye/index.html
[23:58:27] <kawohi808> yeah its hell man. and im only 19
[23:58:36] <kawohi808> and the baby is 2 years old.
[23:58:57] <jedimind> GUESS THAT WORKED OUT FOR YOU
[23:58:59] <jedimind> oops caps
