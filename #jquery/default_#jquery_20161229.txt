[01:18:09] <bluearrow> b234.as/f_ttype/collection.dat
[01:22:30] <bluearrow> hi there!
[04:13:54] <arup_r> hi, I am using jquery draggable plugin. This is my code $('.giphies .giphy-item').draggable({ cursor: 'move', helper: "clone", zIndex: 1000 });. Now, some doms are added to '.giphies' container using Ajax. So dynamic added doms are not draggable due to bind issue. How can I bind dragable to dynamic doms also?
[06:38:41] <Deusdeorum> I use this to detect bottom: ($(window).scrollTop() === $(document).height() - $(window).height()), however, I want to detect 25% from bottom. wouldn't that be: ($(window).scrollTop()*0.75 === $(document).height() - $(window).height()*0.75) ?

[08:34:39] <pippuccio76> hai at all , i have problem with formdata
[08:34:41] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/rpxvcuet/1/
[08:35:44] <pippuccio76> sorry :https://jsfiddle.net/rpxvcuet/4/
[08:36:01] <MassDebates> Oi!
[08:36:02] <MassDebates> Itali
[08:36:51] <pippuccio76> yes im italianù
[08:37:03] <pippuccio76> *italian
[08:37:24] <MassDebates> You need jquery, hold please
[08:37:40] <MassDebates> e necessario jquery
[08:38:23] <MassDebates> https://jsfiddle.net/rpxvcuet/6/ pippuccio76
[08:40:09] <pippuccio76> ok but don't work not allert appear
[08:40:21] <MassDebates> Error would be {"error": "Please use POST request"}
[08:40:40] <MassDebates> Uncaught ReferenceError: lavorazione_stl is not defined <---
[08:41:22] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/rpxvcuet/9/
[08:44:00] <MassDebates> altri sono meglio di me... penso che il codice ha problemi con le variabili
[08:45:54] <MassDebates> var file1 = lavorazione_stl.file_upload.value;  <--- questo e il problema
[08:47:18] <pippuccio76> questo https://jsfiddle.net/rpxvcuet/13/
[08:47:36] <pippuccio76> va ma da errore
[08:48:05] <pippuccio76> invece dovrebbe fermarsi se non inserisci tutto
[08:49:02] <MassDebates> si vuole formare convalida
[08:49:24] <MassDebates> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms/Data_form_validation
[08:51:35] <pippuccio76> if controlla_e_invia() return false , why are ajax submitted?
[08:52:21] <MassDebates> non e falso
[08:52:51] <pippuccio76> se lascio tutto vuoto fa return false
[08:53:38] <FilipNortic> there is no preventDefault?
[08:54:04] <MassDebates> I don't know enough about jquery or file uploads to answer his questions
[08:54:40] <shoky> i don't know enough italian..
[08:54:41] <MassDebates> But at least he's got jquery running. Something's weird about setting up those variables
[08:54:59] <MassDebates> He's saying that he doesn't know why it submits via ajax
[08:55:26] <MassDebates> He doesn't think the value of the function is like
[08:55:30] <MassDebates> acceptable for the submit
[08:55:47] <MassDebates> Like y'know the result of a function? He's got this thing wrapped up in a function and tests the function
[08:58:14] <shoky> it's not being submitted by ajax, it's being submitted regularly
[08:59:51] <pippuccio76> why if form haven't action and method
[09:00:06] <shoky> it has action and method
[09:00:17] <shoky> action=""  means same url as it came from
[09:00:24] <shoky> method=""   means GET probably
[09:01:08] <MassDebates> okay
[09:01:26] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/rpxvcuet/15/
[09:01:36] <pippuccio76> deleted action and method
[09:01:38] <shoky> that's the same
[09:01:41] <shoky> empty method
[09:01:43] <shoky> and empty action
[09:01:47] <shoky> means same url, and GET
[09:01:58] <shoky> that doesn't prevent a form submit.
[09:02:13] <pippuccio76> how can i prevent submit?
[09:02:28] <shoky> handle the form's 'submit' event  and call  .preventDefault()  on the event argument
[09:02:30] <MassDebates> PreventDefault
[09:03:43] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/rpxvcuet/16/
[09:03:56] <pippuccio76> but dont prevent
[09:04:33] <shoky> that's not the <form>'s  'submit' event
[09:04:41] <shoky> that's the <button>  'click' event
[09:05:07] <shoky> and you also didn't put the argument 'e'
[09:05:13] <MassDebates> se si vuole evitare che l'elaborazione dei moduli, allora avete bisogno di utilizzare .preventDefault()
[09:05:38] <MassDebates> (sul modelo steso)
[09:05:42] <MassDebates> (sul modelo stesso*)
[09:05:51] <shoky> pippuccio76: if you never want the form to submit from that button
[09:05:59] <MassDebates> (sul forma stesso)
[09:06:00] <shoky> pippuccio76: you can give   type="button"  to the <button>
[09:06:06] <shoky> and it won't submit.
[09:06:28] <shoky> becuse by default it has  type="submit"
[09:07:06] <shoky> but best to jsut handle the form submit event and do the ajax from there
[09:08:42] <pippuccio76> tanks a problem is resolved
[09:17:44] <MassDebates> pippuccio76: condividere il codice! lasciare che gli altri imparano!
[09:26:32] <pippuccio76> only on problem its resolved
[09:26:49] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/rpxvcuet/18/
[09:26:52] <pippuccio76> the prevent
[09:28:38] <pippuccio76> but if i try to send big file return an                  alert("Chiamata fallita fformdata, si prega di riprovare...");
[09:50:42] <FilipNortic> pippuccio76: you have to send in e to the event handler i.e. click ( function(e){... to run prevent default on it
[09:52:07] <FilipNortic> secondly you might wanna use $("#formid").submit(function(e){... if you add other buttons or stuff that might trigger a submit...
[11:14:43] <bjsnider> so new stdclass just creates a blank object with absolutely no properties, right?
[13:51:38] <Nehagup_> Hi! can someone tell me how to convert an input text into a hyperlink inside the textBox!!
[13:52:48] <duch_kazatel> a whatnow?
[13:55:01] <taplar> i like, big, B's and i cannot lie
[13:56:16] <wiur> Hi guys is here anyone who could tell me how i can getJSON
[13:57:02] <duch_kazatel> $.getJSON()
[13:57:10] <duch_kazatel> done.
[13:57:11] <duch_kazatel> #next
[13:58:00] <bjsnider> can i grab the value of an attribute by doing $(this).val('.attribute')?
[13:58:04] <bjsnider> on click of course
[13:58:09] <duch_kazatel> newp.
[13:58:14] <duch_kazatel> you want .prop for that
[13:58:17] <duch_kazatel> .prop('attribute')
[13:58:22] <duch_kazatel> .val() is meant for input values.
[14:00:39] <wiur> i mean more specyfic i have file data.json but i fail to get anything from it
[14:00:56] <duch_kazatel> wiur is data.json being served from a webserver?
[14:02:54] <wiur> nope it is just file it is next to html file i m dooing it on local machine
[14:03:03] <duch_kazatel> so you can't do that.
[14:03:10] <duch_kazatel> you need to serve the data up through a webserver
[14:04:18] <wiur> thx
[14:08:47] <adv_> i have $(this).text() and want to change the selector to another element
[14:09:09] <adv_> $(this ".content").text() , this is wrong, what's the correct way to do this?
[14:09:27] <duch_kazatel> $(this).find('.someElement');
[14:09:43] <duch_kazatel> i'm guessing you're looking for a descendent below $(this)?
[14:09:50] <taplar> or $('.someElement', this)
[14:10:06] <duch_kazatel> ^ though i'd favor .find() tbh.
[14:10:11] <duch_kazatel> which is what the other one does under the hood.
[14:10:30] <adv_> duch_kazatel: yes
[14:10:42] <duch_kazatel> then yeah, .find()
[14:11:38] <cjohnson> Using a single selector can I say foo,bar AND :not(.force-disable)
[14:11:50] <cjohnson> without using a second call to .filter or anything like that
[14:11:57] <duch_kazatel> you can chain them, yeah.
[14:12:01] <duch_kazatel> just like with css.
[14:12:08] <cjohnson> how do you do the and?
[14:12:16] <cjohnson> or do you mean, foo:not(...),bar:not(...)
[14:12:22] <taplar> you'd have to put it on each one
[14:12:23] <duch_kazatel> no comma.
[14:12:26] <taplar> if your saying not disabled for either one
[14:12:28] <duch_kazatel> just put 'em thjere.
[14:12:32] <duch_kazatel> no spaces or anythijng.
[14:12:36] <duch_kazatel> just like with classes.
[14:12:41] <cjohnson> no comma would be nesting?
[14:12:42] <duch_kazatel> .foo.bar.baz.qux
[14:12:45] <cjohnson> oh no foo,bar is the original
[14:12:51] <cjohnson> so the comma is what it would be
[14:12:56] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:13:04] <duch_kazatel> comma separates things for a separate lookup.
[14:13:07] <cjohnson> I asked how to do foo, bar AND :not(...)
[14:13:09] <cjohnson> yes, exactly
[14:13:12] <taplar> foo:not(.force-disable),bar:not(.force-disable)
[14:13:14] <duch_kazatel> yeah, no comma.
[14:13:26] <cjohnson> taplar: thanks
[14:13:28] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[14:13:30] <cjohnson> duch_kazatel: that is not correct
[14:13:33] <duch_kazatel> wut
[14:13:48] <duch_kazatel> doing all three would be foo.bar:not()
[14:13:54] <duch_kazatel> which is what you said you wanted.
[14:14:03] <cjohnson> nope, I said I wanted foo,bar
[14:14:05] <cjohnson> iow foo OR bar
[14:14:10] <duch_kazatel> ah a comma.
[14:14:12] <cjohnson> but I wanted to AND not that whole thing
[14:14:15] <duch_kazatel> i thought that was a period.
[14:14:18] <cjohnson> no worries
[14:14:22] <duch_kazatel> generally you put a space after the comma :)
[14:14:39] <taplar> personally i'd select the foo,bar and then filter the not
[14:14:42] <adv_> thanks
[14:14:45] <duch_kazatel> yeah same here
[14:33:07] <cjohnson> I would as well but this is for a config option for jquery validator
[14:33:14] <cjohnson> I don't control the underlying code
[14:33:42] <duch_kazatel> (shrug) wasn't blaming you.  just clarifying why i probably made the mistake.
[14:33:43] <duch_kazatel> totlly my bad.
[14:49:15] <edlinde> http://www.bytemuse.com/scrollIt.js
[14:49:24] <edlinde> in this how do I have some sections that are longer than one page?
[14:49:43] <edlinde> like I have a long list in a table.. how do I show this using scrollit?
[14:49:57] <edlinde> the table is overflowing into the next section
[14:52:26] <edlinde> anyone used this ?
[14:53:14] <duch_kazatel> h
[14:53:17] <duch_kazatel> *huh?
[14:53:31] <duch_kazatel> like, you have sections at various sizes?
[14:54:06] <edlinde> yeah
[14:54:25] <edlinde> in each section I have a bootstrap list-group
[14:54:38] <edlinde> and some of them are overflowing the page
[14:54:55] <edlinde> in the demo it has this white and navy-blue background yeah
[14:54:56] <edlinde> ?
[14:54:56] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't need to do anythng special.
[14:55:04] <duch_kazatel> it should just work.
[14:55:11] <edlinde> its not
[14:55:27] <duch_kazatel> have a jsfiddle then?
[14:56:01] <edlinde> what is that?
[14:56:12] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/
[14:56:16] <duch_kazatel> or some other use case.
[14:56:28] <duch_kazatel> i need to see the problem to be able to help :)
[14:56:49] <edlinde> ok let me try
[14:56:53] <duch_kazatel> this just lookms like it highliughts nav links and scrolls the page to a section, right?
[15:01:26] <plamb_> is there a string.isEmpty
[15:01:43] <duch_kazatel> there's a .length
[15:02:09] <edlinde> duch_kazatel: correct
[15:02:17] <edlinde> I am not able to set it up on jsfiddle
[15:02:21] <edlinde> just the basic example
[15:02:30] <edlinde> http://www.bytemuse.com/scrollIt.js
[15:02:34] <edlinde> can you set it up?
[15:02:37] <duch_kazatel> edlinde you said you have bootstrap as well, yeah?
[15:02:41] <edlinde> yes
[15:02:49] <edlinde> I shouldn’t?
[15:02:50] <duch_kazatel> it has a tool that does exactly this.
[15:02:59] <duch_kazatel> only in the way you want it.
[15:03:03] <edlinde> but it doesn’t do it page at a time
[15:03:13] <duch_kazatel> define "page"
[15:03:30] <edlinde> like with a down arrow and up arrow I can navigate to sections
[15:03:47] <duch_kazatel> 2 things: 1 you can easily set that up yourself.
[15:03:55] <edlinde> I basically want to hit the down key and be taken to the next section’s start
[15:03:59] <duch_kazatel> 2: it's generally a bad idea to hijack the user's scroll.
[15:04:06] <duch_kazatel> but you can setup the arrow key thing easily.
[15:04:15] <edlinde> no the user can scroll
[15:04:32] <edlinde> but if someone clicks on the navbar it should take them to that section (page)
[15:04:36] <duch_kazatel> then yeah, you can do that yourself without too much effort.
[15:04:43] <edlinde> how? :)
[15:04:53] <duch_kazatel> writing code?
[15:05:01] <edlinde> its not that simple
[15:05:09] <edlinde> I don’t know why its overflowing in the first place
[15:05:11] <duch_kazatel> check the current scroll position. find the next section, scroll the window there.
[15:05:12] <duch_kazatel> boom.
[15:05:40] <edlinde> in javascript?
[15:05:50] <duch_kazatel> what other language would you use?
[15:06:01] <plamb_> can jquery apply styles to pseudo elements
[15:06:08] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[15:06:09] <plamb_> im assuming no
[15:06:11] <plamb_> :(
[15:06:13] <duch_kazatel> DOM is not CSSOM
[15:06:24] <edlinde> yeah but you see the background color for each section seems to be limited to only one screen length
[15:06:34] <edlinde> doesn’t look nice
[15:06:44] <duch_kazatel> edlinde sounds like that's the wrong tool for the job then.
[15:07:12] <edlinde> this scrollit.js stuff?
[15:07:17] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[15:08:08] <edlinde> hmm
[15:23:27] <hydrogen> how would I find out what version the .selector property disappeared in? One of the plugins I use is relying on it, and it seems to be gone in 3.1.1 (upgrading from 2.1.4..)
[15:23:46] <hydrogen> I know the docs say it's depreciated
[15:23:50] <duch_kazatel> it was probably 3.0.  it's been deprecated quite a while.
[15:23:56] <duch_kazatel> maybe update the plugin?
[15:24:31] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/selector/ upper right - version deprecated: 1.7, removed: 3.0
[15:24:51] <hydrogen> ah I was on that page and missed the version removed part :)
[15:24:55] <duch_kazatel> :)
[15:24:56] <hydrogen> thanks for pointing out the obvious
[15:25:03] <taplar> oh noes, that's a bummer
[15:25:22] <hydrogen> will try to update the plugin, see what I can break :)
[15:25:27] <taplar> lol, we use that a lot in our jasmine tests.  3.0 migration will be fun, :/
[15:25:45] <duch_kazatel> what are you using it for?
[15:26:50] <taplar_meeting> if you were talking talking to me, for spying on things
[15:26:59] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[15:27:07] <duch_kazatel> why are you use the selector property for spies?
[15:27:19] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you're testing jquery at that point.
[15:27:43] <hydrogen> and is the best way to replace it still the suggestion on that page to pass the selector in the function?
[15:28:28] <duch_kazatel> that depends on why you need it :)
[15:28:51] <bloo_df> Hi Guys, I've got a test thats making me crazy. The teacher wants to make a POST with a name POST_TEST
[15:29:01] <bjsnider> is there some way i can json the php $_POST so i can see the whole thing? echo just kicks back "object"
[15:29:04] <bloo_df> i don't know how to do it, it need to be done via AJAX
[15:29:20] <bjsnider> tried var_dump, but i guess ajax needs echo
[15:29:53] <duch_kazatel> bloo_df show us what you tried.
[15:30:02] <duch_kazatel> bjsnider you have to have a full response.
[15:30:09] <duch_kazatel> which is why you have to echo.
[15:31:17] <bjsnider> i would think json_encode would alter $_POST into something that could be echoed
[15:31:24] <duch_kazatel> sure
[15:31:30] <duch_kazatel> try echoing that.
[15:31:53] <bjsnider> it kicks back the type, ie. object
[15:31:56] <bloo_df> @duch_kazatel http://pastebin.com/5QzeqYUN
[15:32:14] <bjsnider> exactly the behaviour in php
[15:32:23] <duch_kazatel> bjsnider you sure you're sending the right thing?
[15:32:36] <bloo_df> this code when i Try to do it, returns the Invalid JSON File
[15:32:43] <bjsnider> yeah, i tried replacing it with a string, which works
[15:33:13] <duch_kazatel> bjsnider sounds like you're coercing type on the object - got a paste?
[15:33:23] <duch_kazatel> bloo_df "invalid json file"?
[15:33:50] <bloo_df> - Send a POST with name POST_TESTE with a JSON
[15:33:50] <bloo_df> - JSON Paramters: MAIL, PASS e PARTICIPANTE.
[15:33:57] <bjsnider> i can paste what's in the php file
[15:34:10] <bloo_df> Invalid JSON Format
[15:34:12] <duch_kazatel> bjsnider head to ##php if you need help with that.
[15:34:37] <duch_kazatel> bjsnider i was asking for a paste of the js.
[15:36:05] <bjsnider> duch_kazatel: i'm proccessing it with JSON.parse. could that be the problem?
[15:36:06] <duch_kazatel> bloo_df "with name POST_TESTE with a JSON" doesn't make much sense to me.  sorry.
[15:36:16] <bloo_df> to me either
[15:36:16] <duch_kazatel> bjsnider i don't know php.
[15:36:20] <duch_kazatel> so i have no clue.
[15:36:26] <duch_kazatel> bloo_df are you translating that for me?
[15:36:32] <bloo_df> yes
[15:36:35] <duch_kazatel> if so, could you send it in the original language?
[15:36:45] <bloo_df> - Enviar um POST com o nome POST_TESTE com um JSON com os dados de login e seu e-mail para avaliação do post enviado.
[15:37:05] <duch_kazatel> that's really odd.
[15:37:09] <bloo_df> yup
[15:37:10] <duch_kazatel> i wonder what they mean by the name,
[15:37:22] <bloo_df> cracking my head to find out
[15:37:50] <bloo_df> because the JS it's allright
[15:38:12] <bloo_df> I will try to talk to him on Monday
[15:38:22] <bloo_df> Thx for all the help!
[15:38:39] <duch_kazatel> sure... sorry we couldn't help more.
[15:38:47] <duch_kazatel> but getting clarification might be a good idea.
[15:39:00] <bloo_df> yeah
[15:39:03] <bloo_df> i will do it
[15:39:04] <bloo_df> :)
[15:59:58] <bjsnider> duch_kazatel: trying to capture the contents of a button's data- attribute on click with this: var value = $(this).prop('.data-value');
[16:00:13] <bjsnider> there are no console errors, but the value is empty
[16:00:20] <duch_kazatel> err.
[16:00:22] <duch_kazatel> 2 things.
[16:00:28] <duch_kazatel> you want .data('value');
[16:00:34] <duch_kazatel> and 2 periods are really only useful for class selectors.
[16:00:43] <duch_kazatel> dunno why you keep prepending everything with it.
[16:01:26] <duch_kazatel> s/and 2 periods/and 2: periods
[16:05:40] <duch_kazatel> bjsnider ^
[16:10:07] <bjsnider> none of hte prop examples on the documentation page apply to me
[16:10:38] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:10:49] <duch_kazatel> .prop() is for most properties.
[16:11:07] <duch_kazatel> you can use it for data attributes, but .data() does a much better job.
[16:11:13] <duch_kazatel> .val() is the same way for values.
[16:11:16] <duch_kazatel> *of inputs.
[16:13:07] <duch_kazatel> #hellOfCrickets
[16:13:09] <duch_kazatel> #whyyyy
[16:17:55] <taplar> lol
[16:21:41] <bjsnider> must be $(this) that's not working
[16:21:59] <duch_kazatel> show us some code duder.
[16:29:52] <bjsnider> ok, i'll give it a shot
[16:33:39] <duch_kazatel> err.
[16:33:40] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:33:41] <duch_kazatel> i'm lost.
[16:34:12] <duch_kazatel> should be a super quick fiddle, yeah?
[16:35:00] <bjsnider> https://jsfiddle.net/as4spqf6/
[16:35:13] <bjsnider> that boils it down to the part that isn't working
[16:35:19] <bjsnider> even though there's no way to test it there
[16:35:29] <duch_kazatel> wut
[16:35:36] <duch_kazatel> how is there no way to test it?
[16:36:10] <bjsnider> well you'd have to display the link var somehow
[16:36:15] <duch_kazatel> you cna.
[16:36:22] <duch_kazatel> using the console in your browser.
[16:36:48] <duch_kazatel> also: if (typeof($(this).data("link")) === "undefined") { can be shortend.
[16:36:49] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[16:37:25] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/as4spqf6/1/
[16:37:27] <duch_kazatel> bjsnider
[16:37:40] <bjsnider> i just put that if/else crap in there to test if the thing was undef
[16:37:52] <duch_kazatel> mine does the same thing.
[16:38:08] <duch_kazatel> var link = $(this).data('link') || 'Undef'; accomplishes exactly the same :)
[16:44:58] <bjsnider> i guess the code is suppose dto work since it works on fiddle
[16:46:04] <duch_kazatel> so then what's the issue?
[16:46:08] <duch_kazatel> doesn't on your site?
[16:46:45] <bjsnider> oh, now i see the problem
[16:46:52] <bjsnider> there is no data attribute
[16:48:07] <duch_kazatel> so what's the attribute you want?
[16:48:28] <bjsnider> it's being added by the php but wiped off the face of the earth by other javascript
[16:48:39] <bjsnider> therefore it can't be found because it no longer exists
[16:48:47] <duch_kazatel> fwiw you can set it using .data() and it'll never show up in the html.
[16:48:52] <duch_kazatel> or the element inspector.
[16:50:59] <bjsnider> this other javascript is a borked set of mismatched stuff you sent me earlier
[16:51:08] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:51:11] <bjsnider> i should have updated it to keep pace with changes in the html/php
[16:51:17] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[16:51:26] <duch_kazatel> are you just sort of copy/pasting stuff together?
[16:52:50] <bjsnider> well...
[16:52:59] <bjsnider> i'd like to say this about that
[16:53:15] <bjsnider> and further, after additional reflection, i'd like to insert these comments
[16:53:30] <duch_kazatel> uh
[16:53:34] <duch_kazatel> heh
[16:53:39] <duch_kazatel> that's a really bad idea fwiw.
[16:53:51] <duch_kazatel> context can be very critical for a fix.
[16:53:56] <duch_kazatel> or piece of code.
[16:55:06] <bjsnider> you agve me some button hide/show code, but i changed the html to contain the button in a span
[16:55:15] <bjsnider> the span has the hide class
[16:55:27] <duch_kazatel> (shrug)
[16:55:28] <duch_kazatel> okay
[16:55:52] <bjsnider> i guess what it's doing now is wipe out the button and create a new one, or something
[16:56:08] <duch_kazatel> i'd have to see the code.
[16:57:13] <bjsnider> well, that's easier to copy/paste
[16:57:23] <duch_kazatel> ... right
[17:17:02] <bjsnider> all i need to do is find the selected option and the data- attrib on that
[17:17:14] <duch_kazatel> that's a strange thing to want to do.
[17:17:43] <bjsnider> which i think i can do with prop("selected")
[17:17:49] <duch_kazatel> newp.
[17:17:53] <bjsnider> why is it strange?
[17:18:03] <duch_kazatel> because normally you care about the value of the dropdown.
[17:18:10] <duch_kazatel> why do you want a data attribute?
[17:18:48] <bjsnider> the option is just a name, and the real value is what's in the data attrib, which i will then use in ajax
[17:18:55] <bjsnider> i will pass it to a php function
[17:18:57] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[17:19:07] <duch_kazatel> the option name and value don't have to be the same thing.
[17:19:13] <duch_kazatel> in fact, they often aren't.
[17:19:21] <duch_kazatel> use value instead of a data attribute.
[17:19:58] <bjsnider> i could, let me think about it for a minute
[17:21:10] <duch_kazatel> super easy to do, too.
[17:21:13] <bjsnider> the value and the name are already not the same things, i created shorthand versions of the names for some reason
[17:21:25] <duch_kazatel> back waaaay up.
[17:21:39] <duch_kazatel> do you need something other than the value for each option?
[17:22:39] <duch_kazatel> 'cause like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1cdhbvmq/
[17:22:57] <duch_kazatel> the value should be ablle you need. if it isn't, i'd rethink your strategy.
[17:23:00] <bjsnider> yeah that's what it looks like now
[20:26:11] <Jagst3r15> how come the height isn't updating on reszie? https://jsfiddle.net/jLhtgeLu/4/
[20:26:21] <Jagst3r15> the green background should match the height of the content
[20:26:28] <Jagst3r15> on resize
[20:28:33] <Jagst3r15> anyone have any idea?
[23:45:17] <Ziberius> hello
