[00:00:10] <mazzachre> the jquery object contains a normal array
[00:01:36] <mowol> yeah that worked mazzachre : http://jsfiddle.net/nuCzv/3/
[00:01:42] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:01:44] <lenswipee> hi, how to "grey out" some html when showing ajax loader?
[00:02:00] <lenswipee> say <div class="foo">
[00:02:14] <coldhead> put on sunglasses
[00:02:20] <lenswipee> :D
[00:02:45] <mazzachre> lenswipee: There is a blockUI plugin that works for that :)
[00:03:37] <mowol> put a white box over it and use opacity
[00:04:07] <lenswipee> was hoping for a line of code that "shadows/greys-out" html instead of .hide()
[00:04:09] <mazzachre> Or a grey box :)
[00:04:28] <mazzachre> lenswipee: Use blockUI... Then do $('#mydiv').blockUI();
[00:05:20] <mazzachre> lenswipee: It can also take an optional image (like a loader) and display on the greyed out area... Nifty
[00:05:40] <lenswipee> mazzachre: where can i downlaod it?
[00:05:52] <lenswipee> mazzachre: sounds great
[00:06:32] <tw2113> what type of html would be grayed out
[00:06:36] <mazzachre> lenswipee: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=blockui
[00:07:33] <lenswipee> tw2113: what type of html?
[00:07:38] <tw2113> yeah
[00:07:43] <mowol> none
[00:07:44] <mowol> its all css
[00:08:13] <mowol> use a div or something to cover it using position relative or absolute with some z-index
[00:08:19] <tw2113> css changes the appearance properties of html
[00:08:28] <mowol> and then make it white with an opacity
[00:08:32] <lenswipee> what choices do i have for "html types" o_O
[00:08:54] <tw2113> lenswipee, what's the markup you're going to "gray out"
[00:09:01] <tw2113> is that more clear?
[00:09:03] <mazzachre> lenswipee: Just use the link I provided... it works nicely :)
[00:09:19] <tw2113> i'm trying to figure out what he means by "grayed out" too
[00:09:25] <lenswipee> mazzachre: in the process
[00:09:25] <coldhead> sunglasses
[00:10:10] <lenswipee> tw2113: nevermind. Those that understood solved my problem already :)
[00:10:14] <tw2113> because input types get "grayed out" when they have disabled attributes
[00:10:43] <lenswipee> tw2113: just text and links
[00:11:03] <tw2113> it'd be easy to, make their font color gray
[00:11:12] <coldhead> or put on sunglasses
[00:11:26] <tw2113> go put sunglasses on a kangaroo coldhead :D
[00:11:31] <coldhead> alert('Please put on some sunglasses');
[00:11:37] <wer0ckz> <coldhead> they don't use click() - i removed the click. please see my jsfiddle again http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/ScDZu/2/ - help please

[00:14:51] <mazzachre> coldhead: yahoo answers answer the darndest things :)
[00:16:26] <coldhead> enquiring minds want to know!
[00:17:20] <tw2113> i do?
[00:18:55] <coldhead> some but not all
[00:24:27] <wer0ckz> coldhead
[00:24:29] <wer0ckz> please help
[00:25:20] <coldhead> need working demo, buddy
[00:25:42] <coldhead> and a really vast glass of wine
[00:26:20] <lenswipee> help the poor guy out already....sheesh
[00:27:20] <coldhead> i recommended a plugin, he didn't read the docs, i fixed his implementation to match the docs and now it "doesn't work"
[00:27:41] <coldhead> but it works fine in my head
[00:27:42] <coldhead> so
[00:27:43] <coldhead> ?cc
[00:27:43] <b-ot> coldhead: CASE CLOASED >:|
[00:27:43] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[00:27:47] <coldhead> thanks bot-chorus
[00:29:06] <rightnow|w> Im trying to get an image height with $('.picture').height(); but it says 0. Most likely cause the image isnt loaded yet. Is there any way to solve this? Im using $(function () {
[00:29:19] <innociv> So is there a site like jsfiddle and jsbin that aren't laggy as hell or non-working?
[00:29:56] <coldhead> use .load() to defer doing anything with the height until the img is loaded
[00:29:58] <coldhead> ?load
[00:29:58] <b-ot> coldhead: like an .get but with the possibility to choose section to load (like with anchor)
[00:29:58] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[00:30:11] <coldhead> thanks so much b-ot
[00:30:31] <coldhead> innociv: codepen.io ?
[00:30:34] <rightnow|w> coldhead, thanks so much buddy
[00:30:38] <coldhead> YMMV
[00:31:10] <mazzachre> jsfiddle works fine for me
[00:31:22] <coldhead> ditto
[00:31:27] <innociv> jsfiddle doesn't let you copy-paste and some other weird bugs?
[00:31:53] <coldhead> it's working better for me lately
[00:31:57] <coldhead> are you on some fruity browser?
[00:32:10] <coldhead> i'm on chromium on linux which is pretty low on the testing order and they got there in the end
[00:35:02] <innociv> Newest Firefox
[00:35:09] <innociv> jsbin lags a lot with a lot of code in it.
[00:35:18] <innociv> Its parser is slow
[00:35:25] <coldhead> oh
[00:35:27] <coldhead> downgrade?
[00:35:33] <coldhead> or codepen, that's generally pretty zippy
[00:35:43] <coldhead> i guess jsfiddle is secretly optimised for chromes
[00:35:59] <innociv> jsfiddle had no bugs and was fast before the update.
[00:37:37] <coldhead> but less featureful
[00:37:39] <coldhead> no emmet
[00:38:06] * coldhead np: aidan moffat + bill wells - i got you babe
[00:45:34] <wer0ckz> <coldhead> need working demo, buddy - working fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/f4gZA/ - my fiddle (copy div not working for zclip http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/ScDZu/2/ )
[00:45:40] <wer0ckz> i hope it helps
[00:47:58] <coldhead> wer0ckz: http://jsfiddle.net/f4gZA/724/
[00:48:00] <coldhead> that works
[00:49:08] <coldhead> wer0ckz: what we need is a version of this http://jsfiddle.net/ScDZu/4/
[00:49:27] <coldhead> which doesn't have errors like this in the js console Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'zclip'
[00:49:39] <coldhead> we need your code which ALMOST works so we can make it ACTUALLY work
[00:49:53] <coldhead> instead of code that is so far from working that i would rather nail my scrotum to a coffee table
[00:49:57] <coldhead> and i DO have a coffee table
[00:51:16] <enthrops> Is a book from 2011 too old?
[00:51:50] <Lucaszz> mazzachre: i found solution
[00:52:00] <Lucaszz> take look at this: http://pastebin.com/WxkBkg9F
[00:52:09] <coldhead> enthrops: probably not
[00:52:16] <coldhead> i read books from the early 1900s
[00:52:26] <coldhead> because i am an arch modernist
[00:52:27] <Lucaszz> I created array with data before calling when.apply
[00:52:36] <pallet> Morning all
[00:52:42] <Lucaszz> And I dont need to use arguments variable
[00:52:52] <pallet> can I do $('.jtable-busy-panel-background').css('display','none'); or does it only with with ID's
[00:52:52] <pallet> ?
[00:52:56] <enthrops> coldhead: real helpful, thanks :)
[00:52:56] <Lucaszz> and my array with data has exacly what i need
[00:53:45] <mazzachre> Lucaszz: Apply always only takes an array as argument...
[00:54:45] <coldhead> bot-t: tell enthrops i will never forget you
[00:54:45] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[00:58:08] <coldhead> good old LekeFly

[01:00:16] <pallet> AdamPDotty, are you saying what I'm doing should work?
[01:00:37] <AdamPDotty> yep
[01:01:40] <kai> hi folks.
[01:02:36] * coldhead np: tortoise - djed (bruise blood mix by u.n.k.l.e.)
[01:03:04] <kai> I've got a longish text string that I want to display to my users in a text area so the can select and copy it. unfortunately, the place where I currently have it is a tooltip-like popup that hides on click
[01:04:02] <sn0lan> stoppropegation on the click?
[01:04:14] <sn0lan> kai: stoppropegation on the click?
[01:04:28] <kai> sn0lan: that's return false on the click handler, right?
[01:04:33] <sn0lan> no
[01:04:48] <sn0lan> kai: http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/ It stops the event bubbling up the DOM
[01:05:07] <sn0lan> essentially, stops the other events.
[01:05:15] <pallet> well thats a bugger because it means something else isn't working
[01:05:53] <kai> sn0lan: great, just what I need :)
[01:06:01] <sn0lan> :D No problem
[01:06:35] <coldhead> great work sn0lan
[01:07:05] * sn0lan here all day
[01:07:06] <sn0lan> :P

[01:20:23] <boulet101010> Hi, I'm using jQueryUI's "tabs" widget and am looking for a way to get the event when you close a tab. In the API there's only one "activate" event, i'm looking for the contrary.
[01:53:24] <^^jfc^^> hello, I have a problem when trying to load different sliders on my site. I only get it after refresh the page. The point is that I tried already to load jquery at first before my plugins, and even tried with $(document).ready(function () {
[01:53:26] <^^jfc^^> any idea?
[01:54:34] <fabioportieri> paste code
[02:01:40] <^^jfc^^> thanks fabioportieri, Im pasting it
[02:06:19] <^^jfc^^> fabioportieri this is my script http://pastebin.com/hKx2Zp4y
[02:11:43] <fabioportieri> jfc replace line 4 and 5 with $(document).ready(function() {
[02:12:23] <fabioportieri> you are nesting a document ready inside a window load...
[02:14:24] <Merwin> Hi ! I don't understand why this doesn't work : https://friendpaste.com/3kv2d9SNqq3gjCH6PCKEgS -- Basically I quaery an url with Ajax which returns a 'result' json attribute containing a number.
[02:14:28] <^^jfc^^> thx fabioportieri
[02:14:30] <^^jfc^^> I will
[02:14:34] <^^jfc^^> thanks u very much
[02:14:39] <Merwin> I want to sum all these numbers (done with 10 queries) and show them.
[02:15:51] <Merwin> I thought that using $.when() would simply call my callaback with the values returned by ajax .then() methods but it's not the case. When the $.when().then() is called, my ajax's .then() methods haven't been called yet. I'm kind of lost :p
[02:16:34] <fabioportieri> ^^jfc^^: no prob glad if it works out
[02:22:43] <MickRip> Merwin: Try the first parament of $.when into the async call
[02:23:32] <MickRip> Merwin: *parameter
[02:23:47] <Merwin> MickRip: I don't understand
[02:25:10] <resting> anyone using flot? how does the ticks actually mean? ticks: null or number or ticks array or (fn: axis -> ticks array)
[02:27:35] <Cork> Merwin: as far as i know when doesn't collect the data from the callbacks
[02:27:58] <Cork> it just waits for all the deferred objects to trigger before it calls
[02:28:21] <Merwin> Cork: So when .when() callabke is called, deferred objects haven't be called yet
[02:28:38] <Cork> ya
[02:28:48] <Cork> the then callback is called when all is triggered
[02:29:11] <Cork> but it doens't contain the different responses, just the last one (i think)
[02:30:36] <palominoz> Hello. my use case wants to build an already resolved promise in one line of code. is that possible?
[02:30:46] <Merwin> Cork: From what I debug,  $.when.then() contains an argument: an array of all deferred objects. But I don't know how I can get their data :/
[02:31:19] <Cork> Merwin: the deferr objects doesn't contain the data
[02:31:31] <Cork> hmm, wait yes they have to
[02:31:43] <Cork> but i don't think its exposed outside there .done handler
[02:38:17] <okdamn> hey how do i fire if scrolling i'm on a div element?
[02:39:09] <Merwin> Cork: The problem was that I need to call $/when() with apply
[02:39:25] <Merwin> I can't just pass an array of deffered, eady defferred must be an argument
[02:39:34] <Cork> Merwin:  just saw that too :)
[02:39:53] <Merwin> Cork: https://friendpaste.com/3kv2d9SNqq3gjCH6PCKEgS works ;)
[02:39:53] <Cork> Merwin: apply is needed cause $.when accepts normal objects too
[02:40:39] <Merwin> Cork: I don't understand how it could work on normal objects but whatever
[02:40:47] <Merwin> It works that's good thx :)
[02:41:03] <Cork> Merwin: wheres an example here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[02:41:48] <Merwin> What's the use case ?
[02:43:53] <Cork> Merwin: http://jsfiddle.net/Zd7EM/
[02:44:26] <Cork> it actually does forward the data :)
[02:48:40] <rethus> validation-plugin: how can i check some textfields, and be aware that they dont have the same input (like asdf, asdf for name and surname)
[02:49:01] <rethus> is there a way with equalTo-parameter of the validation-Rule?
[03:16:14] <krad> hi.  i have a form.. empty when it loads.. now if i fill in some input text and then call $("#form_id").html(), the html doesn't contain the filled text, any reason why?
[03:16:47] <krad> it just returns the form with empty values.. like <input value="" etc
[03:17:18] <krad> shouldn't the browser auto update the input field values?
[03:18:09] <fikst> You should use $("#form_id").val()
[03:19:03] <krad> ahh i see.  lemme give it a try
[03:20:41] <daslicht> hello, I have created a simple ajax get to get a json resonse, the structure supposted to be : {"items":{some items here},"offset":"8" }
[03:20:50] <daslicht> the result looks like: http://paste.ie/view/2fcb0936
[03:20:50] <AdamPDotty> browser updates DOM, not source code
[03:20:59] <krad> fikst, what if i don't have my elements inside a form, and i'm just moving them to a form
[03:21:05] <daslicht> as yoi can see the json looks quite good
[03:21:26] <daslicht> but now how do i get the offset variable from the response?
[03:21:45] <daslicht>  success: function( result) {
[03:21:45] <daslicht>                             console.log( result.offset)
[03:21:57] <daslicht> i have tried this , but its undefined?
[03:22:19] <daslicht> the data type is set to json, and if i console log the result i can see it in there
[03:22:26] <daslicht> any idea whats wrong ?
[03:23:20] <Cork> daslicht: what is typeof(result) ?
[03:23:33] <fikst> krad, don't now exactly what you mean, but with .val() the input doesn't have to be inside a form
[03:24:00] <fikst> if you want to  get all the field of a form, you can use serialze $('form').serialize()
[03:24:05] <daslicht> ahh , it says "string"
[03:24:25] <daslicht> do i have to json encode it ?
[03:24:57] <Cork> daslicht: you need to adjust the content-type the server sends
[03:25:06] <daslicht> ok
[03:25:25] <Cork> ex. in php header('Content-Type: application/json');
[03:25:46] <krad> firk, suppose i have a <div id="elements"><input type="text" value="" /></div>, now i open this and fill in some text, now with jquery, how can i copy the html and inject it in a form?
[03:26:32] <krad> $("#elements").val() returns empty
[03:28:24] <fikst> you should use the val() function on the input element
[03:28:28] <fikst> so in this case
[03:28:39] <fikst> $("#elements input").val()
[03:29:00] <krad> yeah but i don't want to manually create the html again
[03:30:12] <petecoop> daslicht, or result = $.parseJSON(result) rather than setting headers, or contentType='json' in the $.ajax
[03:30:18] <Cork> krad: var copy = $('#elements').clone(true); copy.removeAttr('id'); $('form').append(copy);
[03:30:23] <daslicht> i did it
[03:30:56] <daslicht> thank you
[03:31:30] <Cork> the best with fixing it the server side, is that the server actually tells the truth :)
[03:35:07] <krad> Cork, thank you! that actually worked
[03:35:09] <krad> :)
[03:35:24] <Cork> nice
[03:47:51] <mazzachre> I have now gotten to this http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/C64Pm/19/ But I am apparently fighting with resize over the right to set the size of the element...
[03:54:16] <mazzachre> Also, how come drag works with scrolling the target window, when resize does not??
[03:56:37] <daslicht> I like to add and fadein items one after each other :
[03:56:38] <daslicht> http://paste.ie/view/11da2441
[03:56:48] <daslicht> but when i try it like this all get fade in at the same time ?
[03:56:51] <daslicht> why ?
[03:57:10] <Cork> cause animation is async
[03:57:15] <daslicht> i see
[03:57:31] <daslicht> so i need to wait untile teh first is fade in
[03:57:34] <mazzachre> Are animations deffered?
[03:57:42] <mazzachre> deferred even
[03:57:42] <Cork> no
[03:57:54] <mazzachre> damned..
[03:58:27] <Cork> it's already returning a jquery object, so you couldn't get a deferred from it
[03:58:49] <mazzachre> right
[03:58:54] <daslicht> how can i iterate over an object without each ?
[04:00:22] <daslicht> I try to cast it as array
[04:00:39] <Cork> daslicht: function next(index) { if(index >= result.length) { return; }; $(result[index]).hide().appendTo(".event_list_container").fadeIn(1000, function() { next(index+1); }); }; next(0);
[04:01:01] <daslicht> ahh next()
[04:01:08] <daslicht> tahnks
[04:01:18] <Cork> daslicht: that is a locally defined function
[04:01:26] <Cork> i create it at the beginning there
[04:01:29] <daslicht> yeah i just saw it
[04:01:39] <Cork> what you need is a recursive function call
[04:01:44] <daslicht> yeah
[04:02:06] <daslicht> ahh i see
[04:04:32] <mazzachre> Can anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/C64Pm/19/ I am kind of stuck, it seems to work reasonably well when resize west, but less so when resize east...
[04:04:49] <daslicht> Thank you very much
[04:04:52] <daslicht> this really roxx
[04:04:57] <daslicht> I love async stuff
[04:10:13] <sacho> mazzachre, but it happens that jquery objects are "deferred-compatible", and thanks to a bunch of default values, calling $.when(jqueryObj).done() will work specifically for the animations queue
[04:10:55] <mazzachre> sacho: Oh, cool... I just continue to love this this framework more and more... And I have used it since v0.6
[04:16:16] <mazzachre> Hmmm... I am beginning to suspect that this problem isn't fixable and I would have to hack jQueryUI instead :( Not cool...

[05:03:11] <nimp> you've yet to state what the problem is
[05:03:56] <arles_> the porblem is, appending works fine
[05:04:02] <arles_> but remove does not
[05:05:34] <triptec> arles_: set it up in jsfiddle and i'll help
[05:05:50] <seutje> arles_: what would this fieldid variable look like
[05:05:57] <seutje> it looks like it has a period in them
[05:06:10] <seutje> and then you generate elements passing that variable in as class attribute
[05:06:17] <seutje> so u get class="foo.bar"
[05:06:26] <arles_> looks like: 'hh_apl_adresse.test_test2
[05:06:29] <seutje> which means u'd have to escape it when trying to match it again
[05:06:41] <seutje> because the class is "foo.bar" not "foo" and "bar"
[05:07:11] <seutje> so I suggest making the fieldid use a space instead of a period
[05:07:26] <seutje> and then when trying to match it, .split(' ').join('.') it or something
[05:07:44] <seutje> so u replace spaces with dots to create a chain of classes, sort of
[05:07:50] <seutje> does that make sense?
[05:08:22] <arles_> no, thats the name of a field in mysql
[05:08:32] <arles_> i try do design a little mysql query tool
[05:08:45] <seutje> wait, what? o.O
[05:09:06] <arles_> and u can choose what field u want do display and then u can order it
[05:09:27] <arles_> but when u remove the chech in the checkbox
[05:09:38] <arles_> it doesnt remove it from the list
[05:09:58] <seutje> yeah, cause ur selector is borked
[05:10:32] <seutje> $('foo.bar') doesn't match <div class="foo.bar"></div>, it matches <div class="foo bar"></div>
[05:10:57] <seutje> $('foo\.bar') matches <div class="foo.bar"></div>... I think
[05:10:59] <arles_> oh okay
[05:11:08] <arles_> i try it
[05:11:59] <arles_> is there a escaping function in jquery?
[05:12:30] <shoky> $('foo\\.bar')  btw
[05:14:59] <shoky> actually... $('.foo\\.bar')
[05:15:32] <arles_> but the id field is generated dynamic
[05:15:37] <arles_> how to escape that?
[05:15:43] <arles_> escape() does not work
[05:18:04] <shoky> just dont put dots in your class names :\
[05:18:30] <arles_> but i need to do that :/
[05:18:36] <shoky> im sure you dont
[05:19:19] <arles_> yeah with a workaround i dont
[05:19:21] <arles_> mh
[05:20:21] <shoky> .replace('.','\\.')  would escape all dots
[05:20:48] <arles_> ok thx :)
[05:23:39] <BackEndCoder> i have a ajx type thing that seems to be returning sucessful but $('#add_to_attendance').html('<p>You are now attending!</p>'); doesn't do the sucess yey part.. is this deprecated code ? i am trying to use latest jquery
[05:23:53] <BackEndCoder> and my div id matches correctly
[05:26:32] <BackEndCoder> http://jsfiddle.net/DHtRs/
[05:26:34] <BackEndCoder> full code
[05:26:42] <BackEndCoder> it submits
[05:26:51] <BackEndCoder> and returns json
[05:27:01] <BackEndCoder> but doesn't trigger 'succuss'
[05:27:30] <BackEndCoder> or maybe its failing on validation ? $('#attendanceajaxform').validate();
[05:28:19] <BackEndCoder> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'validate'
[05:28:23] <BackEndCoder> lol not to self, read console
[05:48:34] <iLogic> I'm trying to use .on() to listen a click event after an ajax call but it isn't working.. can someone help?
[05:49:03] <sacho> test case please
[05:50:40] <innociv> Why would $(this) not have a .attr('title'), but when I select the exact same element with a selector it does have one?
[05:51:37] <innociv> $(this)[0].title works but $(this).attr('title') is undefined
[05:56:23] <mfranz> Hi All, I have the following code at : http://jsfiddle.net/rA3br/ the first time the #surgery page is loaded the set looks and works correctly, however I have a subpage that adds a new record to the database then when I re-run the loal_surgery_accord function, it does the ajax request but does not inject the new Data element into the DOM it displays the old one that was already created.  I am
[05:56:23] <mfranz> doing the "refresh" so I guess I don't know why it isn't flushing the old data
[05:56:38] <ravenzz> ?demo @ innociv
[05:56:38] <b-ot> innociv: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:56:39] <bot-t> innociv, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:57:23] <mfranz> my demo: http://jsfiddle.net/rA3br/ doesn't work since it can't do the ajax call
[05:58:03] <sacho> innociv, when and how did you set this title?
[05:59:52] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/99YK3/1/ works fine when I cut it down to a test case, as I figured.
[06:01:12] <sacho> then your test case doesn't reflect what's happening :)
[06:01:34] <innociv> Yeah, and I don't get why not
[06:01:51] <sacho> <sacho> innociv, when and how did you set this title?
[06:01:59] <innociv> Just like that
[06:02:06] <ravenzz> innociv try console.dir($(this))
[06:02:41] <ravenzz> see if length > 0, and inspect the node
[06:03:03] <innociv> It does. and 0 has title = the correct title
[06:03:41] <ravenzz> what is in __proto__ ?
[06:03:43] <innociv> but $(this).attr('title') and $(this)[0].title all return an empty string
[06:03:59] <iLogic> nevermind, I got it!
[06:04:10] <iLogic> I'm such a wordpress ninja (:
[06:04:17] <innociv> in __proto__ is jquery"1.9.1"l ength
[06:04:17] <innociv> 	
[06:04:17] <innociv> 0
[06:04:30] <ravenzz> 0? isn't that an object?
[06:04:37] <ravenzz> yes it is
[06:05:13] <ravenzz> innociv dunno try to reproduce the issue :p
[06:05:18] <innociv> Looks like an int to me.
[06:06:01] <sacho> innociv, what do you mean "0 has title = the correct title"? What exactly do you see?
[06:06:51] <innociv> I see a string that matches what is in the html
[06:08:17] <sacho> what do you get when you do console.dir(this);console.log(this.title,this.getAttribute('title')) ?
[06:09:11] <rob897> is there a way with jquery to create dynamic variables from an xml file? in the xml there is a attribute name="" in here is the variable name and in between the tags is the value of the variable.
[06:09:44] <sacho> declare an object and set properties on it
[06:09:59] <innociv> Empty strings.
[06:10:00] <ravenzz> rob897 I don't understand what you mean, but can parseXML() help?
[06:10:13] <sacho> innociv, and console.dir(this)?
[06:10:41] <innociv> The object with 0 that expands to show the correct properties
[06:10:50] <rob897> I can parse the xml fine... I have pulled the variable name and its value out of the xml, just not sure how to declare these as variables while its reading the xml
[06:11:14] <ravenzz> ah ok
[06:11:26] <ravenzz> so what sacho said
[06:12:03] <rob897> Ill need to look for examples
[06:12:25] <innociv> I see title in console.dir(this) yet if I try to console.log( this.title ) it comes out as an empty string
[06:12:43] <innociv> oh wait no it doesn't
[06:12:56] <innociv> just $(this)[0] has title set correctly
[06:13:39] <ravenzz> rob897 var myObj = {}; myObj[xmlattribute] = xmlvalue
[06:14:27] <innociv> OH. I see it now
[06:14:32] <innociv> Fucking jquery ui tooltip is emptying it
[06:14:42] <rob897> and these can be used throughout the page then? almost a global var then?
[06:15:21] <innociv> How do I get an elements tooltip when jquery ui removes it?
[06:16:32] <sacho> uhh
[06:16:59] <ravenzz> rob897 yes if myObj is global, or in the same scope
[06:17:37] <rob897> ok can i post a snippet? easier for me to see by example of what I have
[06:17:52] <ravenzz> sure
[06:19:34] <rob897> http://pastebin.com/kHgEK7iN
[06:20:23] <innociv> I got it
[06:20:51] <ravenzz> ok, take in mind that ajax requests are asynchronous so, you'll be able to use those variables only on success
[06:20:56] <ravenzz> maybe with some delay
[06:21:24] <rob897> ok
[06:21:45] <ravenzz> so $.ajax(/* make the request and set the variables on success */); console.log(myVars.foo); /* here myVars.foo could be undefined */
[06:22:53] <rob897> ok but how do I set the variables on successful xml request
[06:23:44] <ravenzz> you should have an array of objects
[06:23:47] <jlebrech> which event can I use for when a particular object is added to the dom?
[06:25:57] <rob897> so in the loop use: var myObj = {}; myObj[dbname] = dbid;
[06:28:23] <ravenzz> rob897 something like this http://pastie.org/7464242
[06:28:36] <^^jfc^^> hello there. I have an accordion menu that on hover, adds the "open" class thus expands its childs. The point is that if I do hover over a root element and then over its childs, when I come back to make hover over the root element, the childs arent expanded
[06:28:37] <^^jfc^^> http://pastebin.com/gKgKSrxZ
[06:28:43] <^^jfc^^> Any idea?
[06:29:14] <scriptraptor> hi, is it bad practice to do something like: var $el = $('#input_one'); $($el[0].form).submit() {} or $($('#input_one')[0].form).submit() {}
[06:31:02] <ravenzz> rob897 or you can use the jQuery map()
[06:31:07] <ravenzz> ?map @ rob897
[06:31:11] <bot-t> rob897, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[06:31:25] <rob897> ok reading
[06:32:40] <mandarks> why is jquery mobile causing soooo much propagation.? It seems to be making loads of the functions from random scripts on my site run twice. Anyone know if this is on the agenda to get resolved by the next version?
[06:33:16] <vsmith> hey guys.   I've got a jQuery error on my site and am trying to fix it can someone help me figure this out ?   My site:  http://philoveracity.com
[06:34:53] <rob897> using your example you sent, can you show the object in the console log? so console.log(db);
[06:35:06] <scriptraptor> instead of  $($('#input_one')[0].form).submit() {} should i do $('#input_one').closest('form').submit() {}
[06:35:25] <ravenzz> rob897 yep or console.dir(db) after the foreach
[06:35:28] <ravenzz> each()
[06:35:29] <ravenzz> sorry
[06:37:57] <vsmith> any help?
[06:38:04] <mandarks> sure 1 sec
[06:38:35] <ravenzz> rob897 anyway if you want to lookup for a specific db (by id for instance), you should use an object instead of an array of objects
[06:39:17] <rob897> ok I am still new with this, so I am not sure how to do this yet
[06:40:28] <ravenzz> rob897 http://pastie.org/7464329 so that later you can do for example: if (db[10002]) { console.log(db[10002].name); }
[06:40:40] <ravenzz> oops quoted
[06:40:50] <ravenzz> if (db["10002"]) { console.log(db["10002"].name); }
[06:41:06] <ravenzz> and .dbname instead of .name
[06:41:08] <ravenzz> :P
[06:41:35] * ravenzz sleepy after a big lunch
[06:41:54] <ravenzz> rob897 you can ask #javascript for such kind of things though
[06:41:59] <ravenzz> I have to go now
[06:42:06] <rob897> goty
[06:42:08] <rob897> ty
[06:42:28] <ravenzz> np
[06:46:30] <mandarks> vsmith: u still there?
[06:46:51] <vsmith> yep
[06:46:54] <mandarks> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[06:47:20] <mandarks> looks like the library for $.browser got depreciated
[06:47:37] <mandarks> 1st guess atleast
[06:48:01] <vsmith> sooâ€¦ this is a bit greek to me
[06:48:25] <deed02392> so jquery doesn't animate table rows very well
[06:48:33] <deed02392> is it really advisable though to rewrite my tables to use divs instead?
[06:48:53] <deed02392> or should we really accept that animating tables can't be done
[06:48:57] <deed02392> for now at least
[06:51:52] <vsmith> mandarks can you say anything more specific?
[06:53:06] <Niels___> When a user clicks a checkbox i'll hide/show different forms, right now i'm doing it like this.. but it seems a bit extensive, couldn't i do this a bit smarter? http://pastebin.com/25ssyGtW
[06:53:11] <mandarks> your error is ( Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined )
[06:53:12] <mandarks> your code for your sexy slider is:
[06:53:14] <mandarks> var ie6 = (jQuery.browser.msie && parseInt(jQuery.browser.version, 10) < 7 && parseInt(jQuery.browser.version, 10) > 4);
[06:53:15] <mandarks> the version of jQuery your using is (jQuery v1.9.1)
[06:53:17] <mandarks> from version 1.9.1 the jQuery.browser has been removed so your code is dependent on something that doesn't exist
[06:54:18] <mandarks> vsmith:  check for ie6 browsers a different way, and that might just fix your problem
[06:59:17] <innociv> You should probably just not support ie6
[07:01:04] <scriptraptor> i'm not having much luck googling this. how would i select all inputs/select from a from and ignore if type=hidden?
[07:01:19] <scriptraptor> form*
[07:01:56] <sacho> input[type!=hidden]
[07:02:05] <sacho> less googling, more jquery api search
[07:12:19] <s0u][ight> hello, let's assume some ajax code adds a button with id "test" at a given point on a page. how can I select this button with jquery?
[07:12:21] <scriptraptor> do i have to use (select).val() for the current value, or can i use (select:selected) in the selector?
[07:13:12] <scriptraptor> you will only be able to select the button in the callback function i think, because if you try to grab before it's created it won't work ofc
[07:14:08] <sacho> s0u][ight, the same way you select anything else
[07:14:38] <s0u][ight> sacho: it doesn't work that way :/
[07:14:54] <sacho> doesn't work is not an error I've seen anything ever emit
[07:15:50] <scriptraptor> make a paste so people can see what you're doing
[07:16:38] <sacho> scriptraptor, (select:selected) is unlikely to give you results
[07:16:54] <sacho> it's a selector to use on option elements
[07:16:54] <scriptraptor> sacho: i got it, input[type!=hidden],option:selected
[07:17:06] <sacho> why do you need that?
[07:17:17] <sacho> select elements are also included in the input selector
[07:17:38] <sacho> ..rather, the :input selector, sorry
[07:17:38] <^^jfc^^> hello there. I have an accordion formed of a ul with a list of elements. Im trying to access to "ul" when one of its childs has the class "open". I can access from an li to its ul?
[07:18:02] <scriptraptor> they didn't come up i think, i'll try again
[07:18:08] <sacho> use :input
[07:19:06] <s0u][ight> sacho: the page contains a button, upon click the following div gets some code via ajax, now in that code, there is another button, upon clicking, it should trigger another ajax request, however, i seem not be able to select that second button with $("#secondbutton")
[07:19:37] <scriptraptor> sacho that's a nice trick, thanks
[07:19:55] <deed02392> i want to do a toggle() with no animation but I want a callback, how should I do that? just passing a function makes it animate
[07:20:01] <scriptraptor> s0u][ight: definitely sounds like a callback problem imo
[07:21:17] <scriptraptor> sacho :input is grabbing buttons too :d
[07:21:34] <scriptraptor> maybe it's better i'm explicit than keep omitting
[07:21:39] * sacho shrugs
[07:22:43] <deed02392> anyone?
[07:23:08] <WebDragon> http://www.thinkaesthetica.com/ there exists a plugin that does something similar to this but on a larger scale (this one I hand-coded specifically for this client) but what I seem to be remembering is that there is one that exists out there that can fit together a multiplicity of odd-sized frames responsively
[07:23:31] <WebDragon> and still handle rollover states for the images
[07:25:12] <rob897> I have an object in jquery like this request="123456", service="7890" how do I parse this and set these key=value as variables?
[07:25:39] <WebDragon> cannot for the life of me remember what that sort of thing would be called
[07:27:33] <chuwiey> hi all, when using jQuery.ajaxTransport() to register a new transport, if I don't want to specify a specific dataType - will $.ajax use the new transport only if transportCanHandleRequest and if it can't, default to the regular transport? or will it always use my new transport? thx!
[07:29:36] <s0u][ight> sacho: scriptraptor what's wrong with this? http://pastebin.com/9X2jLcbr
[07:30:25] <scriptraptor> you should use .on
[07:32:17] <daslicht> currently I have an inline script , now I like to export it to a external js file and load it with ajax,
[07:32:51] <xec_> deed02392: are you using .toggle() to show/hide?
[07:32:56] <daslicht> what is the best way to initialize the loaded script with some mandatory variables?
[07:33:09] <xec_> deed02392: and you want it instant (no animation)?
[07:33:27] <xec_> deed02392: if so, why would you need a callback...?
[07:39:13] <fabioportieri> bored
[07:39:39] <chuwiey> anyone?
[07:45:01] <daslicht> ok i write my own plugin
[07:50:07] <^^jfc^^> hello there. is it possible. onload a page. Move the cursor the a position. like (0,0) for instance?
[07:51:06] <sacho> no
[07:53:39] <tomasm-> hi, is there  a way to delay a function until after all the content inside it is loaded? specifically pictures. I have a container that needs to check the pictures' size so it can fit all the pictures properly. document.ready is too soon, width is still 0 . not sure if window.load will work, since this code block is loaded via ajax.
[07:53:59] <tomasm-> also I need to consider that maybe a few of the pictures are broken, so it should still load the plugin
[07:54:10] <^^jfc^^> ok, thx sacho
[07:54:10] <tomasm-> asap
[07:56:52] <sacho> "this code block is loaded via ajax" which code block?
[08:07:13] <scriptraptor> sacho: do you know how i can select as i append?
[08:07:21] <scriptraptor> to cache what i'm putting in
[08:18:55] <^^jfc^^> hello there. I have an accordion made with an ul and different li's. When "onclick" expands the inner list of elements, but Im trying that when onclick, expand its inner list of elements, and link to its "href" page. At the moment, only expand the list of elements but Im not able to link to the new page
[08:19:08] <^^jfc^^> any idea to achieve this?
[08:20:03] <spobat> hey
[08:20:10] <spobat> how can I access the "this" object in this context? http://ideone.com/WmdccX
[08:20:41] <spobat> pass it as function argument, right?
[08:20:52] <spobat> function(obj) { obj.sth(); }
[08:21:48] <Iarfen> Hi!!
[08:22:22] <Iarfen> is there a function like $(document).ready but that executes each time the DOM changes?
[08:22:50] <shoky> spobat: $(this)
[08:23:07] <spobat> $(body).bind('DOMSubtreeModified', fun)
[08:23:11] <spobat> Iarfen, try that
[08:23:49] <spobat> shoky, a plain "this" would catch the callback function, right?
[08:24:08] <shoky> spobat: no, 'this' is the clicked element
[08:24:23] <shoky> the element where you binded the event, to be more precise
[08:25:14] <spobat> okay, the word btw is "bound," if I may correct you
[08:25:43] <shoky> you may.
[08:26:41] <spobat> thank you, sir.
[08:26:57] <Iarfen> I have now this code: http://pastebin.com/r8tET2te
[08:27:33] <Iarfen> it works, but I want to know if it will add the same function multiple times to each element, or just one time to each, and then when the DOM changes it adds just the function to the elements that wasn't having it
[08:27:33] <spobat> Iarfen, doesn't it work?
[08:27:44] <Iarfen> spobat: it works, yes
[08:28:47] <spobat> I can't follow your description, sorry :S
[08:29:44] <Andrew_R> Iarfen:  you are trying to catch if the dom changes, so you can rebind your events
[08:29:52] <Andrew_R> you don't need to do this, you can use a delegate instead
[08:30:08] <Iarfen> Andrew_R: what's a delegate, how I change it?
[08:30:35] <Iarfen> spobat: each time the dom changes, that function gives event handlers to some elements right?
[08:30:37] <Andrew_R> maybe not for the each(), but there is probably a better way
[08:30:55] <Iarfen> spobat: I want that the handlers aren't repeated for elements who previously receive event handlers by the same function
[08:31:06] <spobat> Iarfen, pretty much the same as a callback.
[08:31:11] <Andrew_R> $(document).on('keypress', '.formModule_text', function() { $(this).siblings('span').hide(); } );
[08:31:34] <Iarfen> Andrew_R: ok
[08:31:35] <spobat> e.g. in this case, a delegate/callback is a function that's called upon a certain event. e.g. a "click"
[08:33:35] <Andrew_R> Iarfen: you are dynamically adding .formModule_text elements?
[08:34:45] <Andrew_R> if you can set .siblings('span').hide() or .show() when you add the elements, you could lose that whole .each() function
[08:36:44] <Iarfen> Andrew_R: yes, I'm dynamically adding them a few times
[08:39:59] <dclaude> hi
[08:40:44] <dclaude> i have a problem with jQuery(document).ready in combination with print()
[08:40:55] <Mage_Dude> If I have a form, and I call .serializeArray() on it. It should return an array. What the hell do I do if it, for unknown reasons, returns an object? Even though console.log() shows it to be an array of Objects [ Object { ...}, Obj...], typeof still says it is an Object, not an array.
[08:41:21] <Mage_Dude> Can anyone think of why .serializeArray() would return an object?
[08:42:40] <dclaude> if i sumit a form and push a button which causes a call of print()
[08:43:20] <dclaude> and then cancel the print dialog
[08:43:45] <dclaude> sometimes i got "Script70: Permission denied" in IE9
[08:44:14] <clov3r> iarfen: maybe set a boolean data-function attribute to each .formmodule and then check for that value with if (!$(this).attr("data-function")) { $(this).attr({"data-function": true}); <other code> }
[08:44:25] <dclaude> in the jQuery script, function ready, line: if ( !document.body ) {
[08:46:22] <dclaude> has someone an idea in which race condition this could happen?
[08:46:58] <clov3r> mage_dude: isn't everything an object in jquery?
[08:48:23] <dclaude> unfortunately i wasn't able to isolate the problem and to prepare an example which demonstrates it
[08:48:41] <scriptraptor> is it better to redeclare variables in an each() or should i attach them via var to document scop?
[08:48:45] <scriptraptor> +e
[08:49:04] <scriptraptor> the variables are constant for each part of the each()
[08:51:01] <Andrew_R> scriptraptor: are you talking about global variables, or variables that are local to another function which the .each is also part of?
[08:51:30] <scriptraptor> either i put the vars inside .ready() or inside the $('selector').each()
[08:52:43] <clov3r> scriptraptor: i doubt you'll see any difference in real-world applications
[08:52:55] <scriptraptor> just wondering about best practice
[08:53:26] <Andrew_R> inside the ready above the .each() is probably where I would put it
[08:53:53] <clov3r> well the code's a little cleaner possibly by declaring them inside...
[08:54:09] <scriptraptor> inside the each is cleaner for sure
[08:54:10] <clov3r> but putting them outside jquery doesn't need to reinitialise memory
[08:54:18] <scriptraptor> but it's redeclaring
[08:54:33] <clov3r> which probably = less processing
[08:54:35] <clov3r> minimally
[08:54:50] <clov3r> i usually declare them inside
[08:54:59] <clov3r> but have also declared them outside
[08:55:04] <clov3r> depending on my mood :P
[08:55:08] <Andrew_R> you probably wouldn't notice the performance difference, but yes, it's declaring it 1 time vs X number of elements
[08:55:15] <scriptraptor> yes
[08:55:24] <scriptraptor> but also i don't want to attach to global, really
[08:55:35] <scriptraptor> i suppose i could attach to my own object
[08:56:00] <scriptraptor> foo.temps = {}
[08:56:01] <Andrew_R> if it's inside the $(document).ready(function(){  // here }); it's local to that anonymous function
[08:56:03] <scriptraptor> something like this
[08:56:12] <Andrew_R> as long as you use 'var'
[08:56:14] <scriptraptor> ah ofc it's anonymous
[08:56:20] <scriptraptor> good thing you said that
[08:56:25] <scriptraptor> having a major brain fart
[08:56:36] <scriptraptor> ok, outside the each it is
[08:56:41] <Andrew_R> :)
[09:01:02] <dclaude> hasn't anyone an idea or an advice?
[09:05:40] <fonko> guys does anyone knows isotope plug in?
[09:05:50] <fonko> its giving me a really hard time with ie 8
[09:05:56] <clov3r> dcalude: got a working example?
[09:06:16] <clov3r> *dclaude ^
[09:06:47] <dclaude> clov3r: no, unfortunately not
[09:14:13] <evenflow_> im trying to load a map in a jquery tab but it only works the first time the onclick event is triggered.. after the first time the map looks incompleted and zoomed http://jsfiddle.net/QLMQH/14/
[09:24:45] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon all.
[09:28:21] <fonko> does any one knows isotope plug in?
[09:28:54] <Mage_Dude> clov3r: Yes, but if you call .serializeArray(), the API says it returns an array which has me very confused.
[09:33:57] <scriptraptor> if i'm attaching error messages next to inputs, is it wise to id them so i can easily remove on blur etc?
[09:35:24] <Andrew_R> evenflow_: there is a problem with google maps drawing correctly because the div was hidden
[09:35:31] <Andrew_R> if you resize the browser, it "fixes" it.
[09:36:10] <evenflow_> Andrew_R:  resizing the browser?
[09:36:15] <Andrew_R> I was trying to manually trigger a resize event, but for some reason it's not working: http://jsfiddle.net/QLMQH/100/
[09:37:19] <evenflow_> Andrew_R:  you are right.. also when you click otside the div it fixes it
[09:37:20] <Andrew_R> evenflow_: yes, the map div has all the necessary map elements, but they are positioned incorrectly
[09:37:56] <Andrew_R> something may be wrong with my code, I don't think the activate is firing
[09:38:14] <Andrew_R> but if you could trigger a $(window).resize() after the map tab is loaded, it should fix the issue
[09:42:53] <spobat> is it possible to edit a css-rule that applies to all classes .class?
[09:46:54] <stephen_camilo> spobat: yes! use $(".yourclass").css({"attribute":"value"});
[09:48:26] <thomedy> im getting a cannot read the first child of null erro rin jquery... and before i write this in raw js(which i m fully capable of) is there sa simple jquery solution im not aware of... i usually just do raw but im drawn to the simplicity of jquery
[09:48:46] <spobat> stephen_camilo, what if I add a new .yourclass *after* I called this thing?
[09:49:32] <eddiemonge> thomedy: need more infos
[09:50:18] <eddiemonge> spobat: you'll have to re-call it
[09:53:56] <evenflow_> Andrew_R:  i have tried with google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize');
[09:55:34] <stephen_camilo> spobat: the css applied remains the same, unless the new class has any conflicting rule
[09:55:57] <thomedy> this is a direct paste but be aware this is after several sloppy tests so its not tidy or organized so for that i apologize...i t also is smalll however so its somewhate okay
[09:55:58] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/JYBJ6/5/
[09:57:51] <spobat> alright
[09:57:56] <spobat> thank you
[10:01:06] <eddiemonge> thomedy: um thats a big chunk of code. can you break it down to where its actually failing or erroring?
[10:05:14] <thomedy> i dont know the error code shows jquery not mine... which is why it might be fastyer to write it raw
[10:06:39] <eddiemonge> thomedy: heres it a bit cleaned up. cache your selectors and chain and combine properties: http://jsfiddle.net/JYBJ6/6/
[10:07:14] <eddiemonge> thomedy: live link then because i cant troubleshoot something that i have no idea how its interacting
[10:08:47] <Andrew_R> thomedy: jQuery not defined = you didn't select the jQuery library under Frameworks & Extensions
[10:26:29] <affuuff> I have this small piece of script to toggle() some elements, but what should I add to make it be on hide mode by default when page loads ? <script>$(document).ready(function(){$("#button").click(function(){$('.kirjat').toggle();});});</script>
[10:27:43] <affuuff> I tried to read the API but I can't interpret the answer from there. Tried putting some toggle('hide') stuff there but no
[10:30:43] <eddiemonge> affuuff: .kirjat { display: none; }
[10:32:16] <rotham> hey.. whats wrong with this code.. $('#new-option-set-button').on('click',function(e){alert('hi');})
[10:32:33] <rotham> ive tried .on('click', and .click(, and neither seem to work
[10:32:36] <Z3R0> rotham there is no identifer
[10:32:49] <rotham> identifier?
[10:32:56] <Z3R0> try either $(document).on('click','#new-option-set-button',function() { });
[10:33:10] <Z3R0> or attach the event to the parent of #new-option-set-button that is static
[10:34:02] <rotham> thanks
[10:34:06] <Z3R0> np ;)
[10:35:32] <eddiemonge> rotham: there is nothing wrong with your original code
[10:35:37] <eddiemonge> Z3R0: thats incorrect
[10:35:52] <rotham> eddiemonge: for some reason it wasnt working
[10:35:52] <Z3R0> well, that's the only way I have been able to get on() to fire properly
[10:36:04] <Z3R0> I'm going to assume that #new-option-button or w/e is pulled from an ajax src ?
[10:36:08] <rotham> yeah
[10:36:13] <Z3R0> which means it's not there on runtime
[10:36:23] <Z3R0> so on() needs to be attached to something THERE at runtime
[10:36:25] <eddiemonge> thats a different scenario then
[10:36:34] <eddiemonge> then yes, you need to delegate the event handler
[10:36:37] <Z3R0> hehe ;)
[10:36:38] <rotham> ah.. ok thats what was screwing it up
[10:36:50] <Z3R0> so like if you have a container that's static, that you are "filling" in
[10:37:04] <Z3R0> you can do $('#container').on('click','.ajaxClass',function() { });
[10:37:19] <affuuff> eddiemonge: thanks. I added the display: none as a style to that kirjat class and it works. Just a question, this is what you meant right ? or can I somehow add the display: none in that javascript code ?
[10:37:21] <Z3R0> but the referenced item has to exist... document (always exists) but it's just super global
[10:38:18] <eddiemonge> affuuff: thats what i meant but you could also do $('.kirjat').hide()
[10:38:41] <guideX> can someone help me understand why the closest doesn't work ? http://jsfiddle.net/NFkCB/
[10:38:42] <affuuff> alrighty
[10:38:59] <eddiemonge> Z3R0: rotham: and super slow. you want to bind to the closest parent that exists at the time of the binding
[10:39:15] <eddiemonge> guideX: because live is deprecated and removed?
[10:39:24] <rotham> ah ok.. binding to document will slow it down?
[10:39:30] <guideX> hmm I need live because the textboxes are dynamically created
[10:39:32] <guideX> and can't have id's
[10:39:36] <eddiemonge> guideX: and guide checks ancestors, not siblings
[10:39:42] <guideX> hmm ok
[10:39:50] <eddiemonge> guideX: read the api on live see ? live
[10:39:51] <bot-t> guideX, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[10:40:01] <eddiemonge> and then use see ? on
[10:40:01] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:40:09] <guideX> hmm i'll try on
[10:40:36] <eddiemonge> rotham: it means it will have to check every single event on the page to see if it matches your selector instead of localizing it
[10:40:54] <rotham> ah gotcha
[10:41:20] <guideX> hmm ok I changed it to on, but I still don't understand why the closest doesn't work
[10:41:49] <guideX> see http://jsfiddle.net/NFkCB/3/ again
[10:41:50] <eddiemonge> ?closest @ guideX
[10:41:50] <bot-t> guideX, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[10:41:57] <guideX> ah ok
[10:42:09] <guideX> so it should find it...
[10:42:16] <eddiemonge> ?find @ guideX
[10:42:16] <bot-t> guideX, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[10:42:29] <guideX> hmm i'll try that
[10:42:32] <eddiemonge> no
[10:42:39] <eddiemonge> the point was dont try find
[10:42:52] <guideX> oh ok heh
[10:43:02] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/NFkCB/2/
[10:43:11] <eddiemonge> its not a parent, or a child. its a sibling
[10:43:19] <guideX> oh cool
[10:43:37] <Z3R0> oh that's neato :0
[10:43:44] <Z3R0> never seen .next() and .previous() before
[10:43:54] <guideX> thanks eddie
[10:43:56] <Z3R0> so it's literally next() sibling ?
[10:44:04] <eddiemonge> you should read the api. spend some time in http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/
[10:44:19] <guideX> I will
[10:44:28] <Z3R0> so if you have <p><a>this</a></p> <p>That</p>   from <p><a>This -> next() -> <p> ?
[10:44:33] <Z3R0> or does it go to the <a>
[10:45:01] <Z3R0> ooo
[10:45:03] <eddiemonge> try it and see
[10:45:05] <Z3R0> lovley link
[10:45:24] <Z3R0> ah ok it is
[10:45:32] <Z3R0> so <p> -> next() -> next <p>
[10:45:43] <Z3R0> long as it's a sibling relation
[10:45:57] <Z3R0> is find() frowned upon as a search tool ?
[10:46:15] <Z3R0> I've heard some things sometimes that you shouldn't use it, due to it's slower than most selectors?
[10:47:34] <eddiemonge> Z3R0: not true. it has its place just like all the other methods
[10:47:54] <introspectr3> I've been charged with writing an extension for this F&#$&# terrible framework. These guys are injecting csrf tokens automagically and its causing some problems. Any AJAX calls within $(document).ready() work perfect. Any AJAX calls outside of $(document).read() are rejected before they hit the receiving method (the framework is rejecting them). Unfortunately the framework dev's don't provide documentation and
[10:47:54] <introspectr3>  aren't responsive. Does anyone have an idea for a workaround? Somehow to wrap the onclick ajax calls into $(document).ready()?
[10:48:16] <Z3R0> what framework ?
[10:48:21] <introspectr3> hostbill.
[10:48:25] <Z3R0> wtf is that ?
[10:48:39] <sacho> how is it that the document.ready() ones work but the other ones don't?
[10:48:39] <introspectr3> a steaming pos
[10:48:40] <ajpiano> introspectr3: $.ajaxPrefilter
[10:49:00] <Z3R0> wow ajpiano there is a name I haven't seen in a while lol
[10:49:08] <eddiemonge> introspectr3: do you mean in that specific ready block or any ready block?
[10:51:35] <introspectr3> eddiemonge: the calls only work from (document).ready()
[10:51:47] <introspectr3> ajpiano ty, im looking into that now
[10:52:18] <eddiemonge> introspectr3: you can have multiple .ready() blocks. does the code only work from that one ready block?
[10:52:42] <Z3R0> anyone know anything about using dataTables() I am using Ajax to retrieve the source, but if there's no data in the table, it freaks out
[10:53:14] <introspectr3> Z3R0: did you format the json with the datatables values?
[10:53:32] <introspectr3> eddiemonge: can i define onclick functions within a ready() block?
[10:53:37] <Z3R0> I believe so
[10:53:40] <Z3R0> it orks when there is data
[10:53:45] <Z3R0> just not when the table is emtpy
[10:54:09] <Z3R0> so if I were to delete the last item in the table, it would then freak out
[10:54:19] <introspectr3> iirc Z3R0, one of the values specifies how many records there is. i'd make sure that's returning 0
[10:54:44] <Z3R0> I'm not sending that via ajax though
[10:54:49] <Z3R0> ok sorry I misunderstood the frist
[10:54:53] <Z3R0> the server isn't doing any of the configuration
[10:55:09] <Z3R0> it's just sending the data back
[10:55:21] <macen> anybody got a good mootools to jquery introduction?
[10:55:41] <eddiemonge> introspectr3: you can define event handlers in a ready block
[10:55:51] <eddiemonge> macen: try.jquery.com
[10:56:06] <macen> cool
[10:56:14] <Z3R0> ah I think I know what's wrong
[10:56:23] <Z3R0> my initilization array doesn't include ['aaData']
[10:56:31] <Z3R0> so it doens't know how to read it if there isn't anything pushed into it
[10:59:13] <enthrops> Hey guys, a quick question, why does not the first piece of code work, but the second one does? https://gist.github.com/enthrops/f4fd7df5e7e97c14abe0
[10:59:14] <bot-t> (10 hours 4 mins ago) <coldhead> tell enthrops i will never forget you
[10:59:39] <Z3R0> because it's loading before the doc is ready ?
[11:00:02] <eddiemonge> enthrops: do you know what $(function() {  }) is?
[11:00:05] <enthrops> Z3R0: duh
[11:00:10] <enthrops> got it, thanks
[11:00:37] <introspectr3> wow eddiemonge: you rock hardcore. thank you much.
[11:01:19] <Z3R0> he's one smart cookie ;)
[11:01:33] <enthrops> js gets reinterpreted every time a page loads right? If I've got one gigantic js for all pages, every reload will cause it to be interpreted?
[11:01:40] <eddiemonge> ugh. jerks. now i want a cookie lol
[11:01:50] * Z3R0 hands eddiemonge a cookie!
[11:03:06] <defaultro> afternoon folks, what's the different between $('button').click and $('button').on('click' ......
[11:03:12] <defaultro> afternoon folks, what's the difference between $('button').click and $('button').on('click' ......
[11:03:25] <Z3R0> I'll let eddie discuss that one in more depth
[11:03:59] <Z3R0> because I don't know the regular difference with just on() rather than the live() replacement
[11:04:31] <defaultro> k
[11:08:01] <eddiemonge> defaultro: on calls click internally
[11:08:29] <defaultro> didn't get that
[11:08:54] <defaultro> can you jsfiddle the 2 if it's ok?
[11:10:00] <scriptraptor> how can i make a parent element wait until all animations are finished on child elements?
[11:11:38] <sacho_> eddiemonge, don't you mean the other way around?
[11:12:15] <eddiemonge> scriptraptor: callback
[11:12:25] <norjor> Hi, the following "$('#form_register').serialize()" will give me eg. "flname=&email=&confemail=&pass=&confpass=&registeractionx=1", but what I need is this: "flname_value/email_value/confemail_value/..etc" ..I'm a big jquery beginner, hope makes sense
[11:12:32] <scriptraptor> i dont want a callback, it's .promise() or something?
[11:12:47] <sacho_> scriptraptor, elements can't "wait"
[11:12:50] <eddiemonge> sacho_: you are right
[11:12:57] <sacho_> $.when(childElem).done()
[11:13:38] <eddiemonge> defaultro: click calls on() internally
[11:14:23] <eddiemonge> norjor: why do you think you need it that way?
[11:14:50] <norjor> because that is how aura router map arguments, which is what im using
[11:15:03] <defaultro> eddiemonge, I am really sorry but I'm not sure what internally means as compared to when using .click
[11:15:28] <defaultro> what's the difference, when is one an advantage
[11:15:41] <eddiemonge> defaultro: function click(ele) { ele.on...
[11:15:54] <eddiemonge> thats what jquery does in a nutshell
[11:16:22] <defaultro> k
[11:16:54] <defaultro> am i right that when we use .on, we are also attaching an event handler so that it will also work for non-existing elements when they become available?
[11:16:56] <eddiemonge> so use on whenever you can
[11:17:25] <eddiemonge> i rarely ever use the convenience methods like .click(), .keydown() etc. i generally use .on()
[11:17:32] <defaultro> k
[11:18:33] <eddiemonge> norjor: your php should be able to handle that
[11:20:00] <norjor> okay eddiemonge, ill think of something.. I think your right about this -_-
[11:25:04] <eddiemonge> job interviews are interesting sometimes
[11:26:40] <eddiemonge> do some job phone interviews, play some diablo 3, help out in jquery irc. life is simple at the moment
[11:34:56] <jshultz> does somebody hae a quick second. I have a mobile site: http://dev.m.ciena.com/ that I upgraded to jquery mobile 1.3. It works on desktop but not on mobile. I touch a menu option, and i get an overlay, and then it stops
[11:36:31] <gnarf> anyone else in here bitching about the website in the last hour or so?
[11:36:42] <gnarf> some guy on twitter was like "your site is down"
[11:36:58] <gnarf> which probably just means "i typoed the domain" but ya know, might as well check
[11:37:05] <gnarf> haven't seen any issues
[11:38:13] <evenflow_> everything fine
[11:39:38] <dclaude> hi again
[11:39:45] <dclaude> i had to leave earlier
[11:39:51] <dclaude> back to my problem
[11:40:02] <scriptraptor> $.when..done(function() {}) isn'rt working -.-
[11:40:24] <dclaude> i have a problem with the ready function of jQuery in combination with print() in IE
[11:40:43] <dclaude> if i submit a form and then click a button to call print()
[11:41:23] <dclaude> sometimes the function ready crashes because of "Script70: Permission denied"
[11:42:59] <dclaude> in line : if ( !document.body ) {
[11:43:09] <dclaude> i don't use frames
[11:46:19] <Erkkimon> Is it possible to break (hyphenate) words between two consonants? I just need to break Finnish words somewhere and between two consonants it's always right. Any ideas?
[11:53:11] <scriptraptor> i'm about to rage delete everything i did the last 5 hrs because of a bug
[11:59:44] <gnarf> `p @scriptraptor
[12:05:31] <TheSisb> $.when (   // USE COMMAS ).then( //USE COMMAS );
[12:05:37] <TheSisb> .done if needed
[12:08:16] <rebel_yell> So iv come across an issue
[12:08:27] <rebel_yell> Going back with ajax
[12:08:31] <rebel_yell> click the backspace
[12:08:35] <rebel_yell> and ajax
[12:08:44] <rebel_yell> anyone know any good solutions?
[12:09:31] <tubbo> lol what
[12:09:44] <tubbo> rebel_yell: way to describe your issue AT ALL...
[12:09:50] <rebel_yell> lmfao
[12:09:54] <rebel_yell> sorry
[12:10:15] <rebel_yell> So users can search and update the index page with AJAX, but if they hit backspace they wish to go to their previous result
[12:10:33] <rebel_yell> unfornantely this just brings them to the request .referer not the previous get request
[12:11:27] <rebel_yell> So what i am looking for is a simple AJAX.undo last get request
[12:11:39] <Z3R0> $(document).on('hover','a.preview',function(e){ // can hover not be used in this context?
[12:11:48] <scriptraptor> have a good weekend everyone
[12:13:53] <eddiemonge> rebel_yell: simple? so you are saying they go BACK in their history and you want to perform that ajax action again?
[12:14:07] <opie-x> rebel_yell: store the get requests, handle backspace keypress, pop get request from storage queue and replay it
[12:14:26] <Z3R0> eddiemonge thoughts on the "hover" ?
[12:15:12] <rebel_yell> how would one store a get request
[12:15:22] <opie-x> get requests are only urls
[12:15:33] <opie-x> so they are strings
[12:15:45] <opie-x> push and pop them to a fro an array
[12:16:19] <opie-x> how do you initiate the get request?
[12:16:44] <opie-x> there isn't an ajax.undo and there never will be because there can't be
[12:17:13] <Z3R0> I thought the back button was browser dependent, that you couldn't really prevent it ?
[12:18:06] <opie-x> well
[12:18:11] <opie-x> he specifically said backspace
[12:18:17] <opie-x> but yeah, back button not so much
[12:18:24] <rebel_yell> Links and filters
[12:18:52] <Z3R0> well figured why one and not the other? lol
[12:18:53] <rebel_yell> so in order to store a get request
[12:19:00] <opie-x> you need to do more advanced url management if you want the correct solution, which i doubt he's looking to invest the knowledge into
[12:19:05] <Z3R0> why go through the trouble to safe guard the "backspace" button when browser back still functions normally
[12:19:35] <opie-x> because of the complexity increase due to supporting that behavior from back button
[12:19:43] <rebel_yell> im gonna re write the whole back feature
[12:19:43] <opie-x> just trying to offer solutions
[12:19:50] <Z3R0> hehe
[12:20:04] <rebel_yell> in a sense
[12:20:10] <eddiemonge> Z3R0: what do you mean?
[12:20:13] <rebel_yell> so how would one store a get request.
[12:20:17] <rebel_yell> or even alert it
[12:20:23] <rebel_yell> alert(GET.request)
[12:20:28] <opie-x> do you use ajax to make the request
[12:20:55] <rebel_yell> forms
[12:21:51] <opie-x> i guess i'm misunderstanding your issue then
[12:22:05] <eddiemonge> rebel_yell: you store the result of the request, not the request
[12:22:40] <rebel_yell> eddiemonge: and how would i store that?
[12:23:05] <eddiemonge> var result = []; $.get(url, function(data) { result.push(data) }
[12:26:04] <rebel_yell> eddiemonge:  i did that and then said alert(result)
[12:26:17] <rebel_yell> and error unexpected identifier result
[12:26:48] <Changa> How do I use this so the div slides down? $("#subnav").show(); ?
[12:26:54] <Changa> $("#subnav").show("drop"); ?
[12:27:22] <Andrew_R> rebel_yell: your result variable will probably have to be global, or at least attached to something that doesn't go away when the function closes
[12:27:40] <opie-x> Changa http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[12:28:12] <Z3R0> does hover not work iwht on() ?
[12:28:13] <rebel_yell> its attached to my application layout
[12:28:23] <Z3R0> $(document).on('click','img.preview',function() { // works
[12:28:28] <Z3R0> $(document).on('hover','img.preview',function() { // Fails
[12:28:57] <Andrew_R> Z3R0: use 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave' in the .on()
[12:29:04] <Z3R0> O.o
[12:29:09] <Changa> opie-x -> http://www.edizarca.com/karpaz/ click Home, the subnav should slide down
[12:29:16] <Z3R0> omfg
[12:29:17] <Z3R0> I love you
[12:29:32] <Andrew_R> hover kinda shortcuts setting up those 2 events
[12:31:17] <rebel_yell_> so yea if its in my layout shouldnt it be saving
[12:31:39] <opie-x> Changa i don't think your hashchange event is firing
[12:31:45] <Changa> it is
[12:31:47] <Changa> let me put alert
[12:32:10] <opie-x> ohh
[12:32:13] <opie-x> it's not hitting #home
[12:32:14] <opie-x> i guess
[12:32:54] <opie-x> yeah, i think your hashes are just mixed up
[12:32:58] <Changa> ah yep
[12:33:02] <Changa> fixed it
[12:33:02] <Changa> :p
[12:33:17] <opie-x> +!
[12:33:18] <rebel_yell_> So wouldd result be a hash?
[12:33:29] <Changa> what do you think about the approach to this navigation
[12:33:30] <Changa> :p
[12:33:55] <opie-x> the ux?
[12:33:59] <opie-x> or the code?
[12:34:14] <Changa> both
[12:34:37] <opie-x> the experience is clever, i've seen it on other sites, and assuming you don't have a huge menu it works well
[12:35:08] <Changa> I'm hoping it will work
[12:35:09] <opie-x> it's hard breadcrumb or other things like that with this type of menu, especially deep linking, but if you don't need that it's nice and it gets out of the way most of the time
[12:36:02] <opie-x> your code is very hard coded, which makes it easier to read but hard to re-use
[12:36:14] <Changa> I understand, will have to work on that
[12:36:32] <opie-x> not how i would write it but if it works it works. this site is tiny compared to what i normally work on, so it's likely just fine
[12:36:43] <sivy> hullo folks; I'm using a jquery library that wraps $.ajax, but allows me to pass in options that will be provided to $.ajax
[12:37:24] <sivy> my json source returns a dictionary { data : [the stuff] } but the wrapper is expecting an array response
[12:37:27] <Z3R0> ah got it....
[12:37:32] <opie-x> the counter is neat, and you have nice localization, changa.
[12:37:48] <sivy> is there a callback I can use to transform the response before it's returned to the wrapper?
[12:38:01] <Changa> by localization you mean?
[12:38:24] <opie-x> support for other languages via a simple querystring param
[12:39:59] <Andrew_R> sivy: do you control the json source (server-side)?
[12:40:02] <Changa> ah yeah
[12:40:20] <affuuff> anyone know why this won't show the div/content that I am clicking ? The commented method works, and I just try to run it through a loop http://pastebin.com/iqY3Zs2v
[12:40:23] <sivy> Andrew_R: sort of? it's finicky about not wanting to return lists
[12:40:43] <sivy> i may be able to hack it, but thought i'd see if i could hande it client-side
[12:41:32] <Andrew_R> check with the plugin you are using, sometimes there are callbacks that let you transform the data before it actually gets used
[12:42:52] <Andrew_R> sivy: which plugin is it?
[12:43:52] <eddiemonge> Andrew_R: what are you doing? why dont you use a class and bind to that?
[12:44:17] <eddiemonge> sorry that was for affuuff
[12:45:01] <sivy> Andrew_R: fullcalendar
[12:45:09] <sivy> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_data/events_json_feed/#options
[12:45:14] <DeltaHeavy> Can anybody link me an example of the old way to use the 'ajax' method? I need the same functionality as .done, .fail, and .always.
[12:45:32] <DeltaHeavy> I see 'fail:' and 'done:', but nothing to replace 'always:'
[12:45:34] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: what do you mean? using older jquery?
[12:45:38] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: Yep
[12:45:46] <eddiemonge> complete
[12:46:02] <DeltaHeavy> And that will execute regardless if it's a failure or not?
[12:46:07] <sivy> Andrew_R: ok, looks like i was able to fake out the server-side code
[12:46:21] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: read the page, it says so: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[12:46:33] <affuuff> eddiemonge: i'm trying to display some content from the page and hide other. If I were to bind to class, wouldn't it hide/show all from the class ? or what do you mean
[12:46:46] <Andrew_R> sivy: look at http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_data/eventDataTransform/
[12:46:49] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: but why not upgrade?
[12:47:03] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: Because this is far too complicated to upgrade
[12:47:08] <sivy> Andrew_R: ... *facepalm*
[12:47:12] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: better to do it sooner
[12:47:25] <eddiemonge> affuuff: paste an example at jsfiddle
[12:47:28] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: It's a dated e-commerce framework. Trust me, it's not worth the time lol.
[12:47:37] <Andrew_R> so you could add eventsDataTransform: function(mydata){ return mydata.data; } to your setup and it should work with your original JSON
[12:48:54] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: Thanks for the resources though. Was having a hard time navigating that page but I found it now.
[12:51:07] <sivy> thanks Andrew_R
[12:53:56] <affuuff> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/jFJUX/
[12:54:34] <affuuff> I want it to work in the commented /* */ way from the js code. I will have around 40 items
[12:56:17] <eddiemonge> affuuff: booms http://jsfiddle.net/jFJUX/1/
[12:56:37] <eddiemonge> hashbang in the actual href though?
[13:01:15] <affuuff> eddiemonge: wow that is niec code :)
[13:01:35] <affuuff> I don't get what you mean with that hashbang thing thou :s
[13:02:46] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm not sure why this AJAX request is throwing my 'fail' alert() but nothing is showing up in my Chrome dev tools as far as an AJAX request goes. Anybody know what the issue could be? Any help is appreciated - http://pastebin.com/LP8dZ7q7
[13:04:02] <eddiemonge> #!
[13:04:50] <affuuff> it shouldn't be in the href ?
[13:07:49] <Andrew_R> affuuff: you probably just want "#"
[13:08:36] <collinforrester> Is anyone here familiar with the jQuery Mobile widget factory? and more specifically it's enhanceWithin method
[13:10:35] <affuuff> I think the exclamation mark was there to prevent from scrolling the page up
[13:10:45] <eddiemonge> affuuff: preventDefault()
[13:14:49] <collinforrester> uGoMobi: hey, do you have a few minutes for me to ask you some questions about the widget factory, and more specifically it's enhanceWithin method?
[13:16:29] <GOMADWarrior> what does $clientCounter.html(msg.clients); do?
[13:16:56] <Changa> Can I target a class and remove that class from the target?
[13:16:56] <Changa> :D
[13:18:25] <Z3R0> why not ?
[13:18:36] <Z3R0> $('.myClass').removeClass('myClass');
[13:19:13] <Changa> perfect
[13:19:15] <WebDragon> or $("#idcontainer").find(".myclass").removeClass(".myclass");
[13:19:25] <WebDragon> to limit its scope
[13:19:32] <Changa> how do I target a link using its href value?
[13:19:43] <Z3R0> url = $(this).attr('href');
[13:20:05] <WebDragon> a[href=... it's a css3 feature too similarly
[13:20:11] <Changa> hm
[13:20:21] <GOMADWarrior> ???
[13:21:07] <Z3R0> oh sorry... you wanted to target something based on href?
[13:21:17] <WebDragon> similar in nature to how you can do [class^=footer-top] to target .footer-top-left .footer-topright etc
[13:21:32] <Changa> yes Z3R0
[13:21:41] <WebDragon> but it doesn't work the way you would expect for compound classes, unfortunately
[13:21:48] <maduroheff> Hi room, I'm working on a sign up interface where a user enters their state and city.  I'm using autocomplete and the state field works correctly, but how do I grab the value for the state and use it to filter the results for the city? extraParams seems be deprecated.  and adding ?state="+$('input[id=state]').val() to the source URL doesn't actually append the value.
[13:21:52] <WebDragon> (which I personally find VERY annoying)
[13:22:08] <GOMADWarrior> I just wanna know if it has something to do with the id of the html element
[13:22:15] <WebDragon> i.e. that won't work for class="foo footer-topright" only for class="footer-topright foo"
[13:22:24] <GOMADWarrior> cuz I didn't see clientCounter be declared
[13:23:33] <Changa> Z3R0 -> http://www.edizarca.com/karpaz/ I want to add .selected class to the button on hashchange
[13:23:40] <WebDragon> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ more details here
[13:23:40] <Changa> and hashchange is the href of the links
[13:23:59] <GOMADWarrior> $clientCounter = $("#client_count")
[13:24:15] <dclaude> maduroheff: why don't you use the id selector, if your field has an id?
[13:24:55] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm not sure why this AJAX request is throwing my 'fail' alert() but nothing is showing up in my Chrome dev tools as far as an AJAX request goes. Anybody know what the issue could be? Any help is appreciated - http://pastebin.com/LP8dZ7q7
[13:25:08] <DeltaHeavy> errorThrown returns nothing.
[13:25:21] <DeltaHeavy> Assuming that was in the fail:
[13:25:39] <eddiemonge> maduroheff: manually append the value from state to the city url
[13:26:03] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: what tab are you looking at in the tools?
[13:26:17] <HAPPYFUNBRO> how would I go about seeing when and how various javascript/jquery transform events are fired?
[13:26:27] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: Network, XHR within that in particular.
[13:26:57] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: it doesnt show the request going out at all?
[13:27:07] <eddiemonge> HAPPYFUNBRO: what do you mean?
[13:27:13] <eddiemonge> like debugging?
[13:27:24] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: Nope
[13:27:27] <HAPPYFUNBRO> sort of
[13:27:56] <HAPPYFUNBRO> I need to see when a particular .attr() function is fired, and I need to know what script fires it
[13:27:56] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: no console error either?
[13:28:08] <eddiemonge> HAPPYFUNBRO: thats easy. look at your code
[13:28:08] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: Nope
[13:28:14] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: link?
[13:28:31] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: Can't, it's an admin panel for an e-commerce site.
[13:28:44] <DeltaHeavy> I would otherwise, and thank you for wanting to do that at least.
[13:29:00] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: the code is valid so there is something else affecting it
[13:29:37] <HAPPYFUNBRO> eddiemonge cmon man. if the solution were that obvious, don't you think I would have alread done that? My code isn't doing this, and there are a large number of third party scripts running. I need to know which script is performing the action.
[13:29:46] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: Shouldn't't the request at least ATTEMPT to go though?
[13:30:20] <eddiemonge> HAPPYFUNBRO: then you will have to walk through the code execution to determine where it is happening. breakpoints and stuff
[13:30:36] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: yeah, thats what im saying. there must be something else affecting it
[13:31:05] <DeltaHeavy> I'm completely baffled at this -_-   Wish I didn't have to use this old stuff
[13:31:24] <dclaude> maduroheff: either you have to use quotes around the id: $('input[id="state"]').val() or better to use the id selector: $('#state').val()
[13:31:48] <HAPPYFUNBRO> eddiemonge yes, how to do? tutorial link?
[13:31:50] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: can you try a simple post with just the url to see what happens?
[13:31:57] <eddiemonge> ?ftj @ HAPPYFUNBRO
[13:31:57] <bot-t> HAPPYFUNBRO, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[13:32:08] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: What do you mean? I thought this was as simple as it got?
[13:32:28] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: i meant without all the other params. just $.post('url')
[13:36:32] <bowenac_> Im having am issue with .fadeIn(500); causing my page to jump to a div
[13:37:02] <bowenac_> if I remove the .fadeIn(500); and use .show(); this does not happen... anyone got any ideas
[13:37:53] <bowenac_> using links to hide show divs
[13:38:42] <eddiemonge> bowenac_: are you preventingDefault? are your links href="#xyz"?
[13:38:53] <bowenac_> not using href
[13:39:23] <eddiemonge> more info needed then. example code?
[13:39:49] <bowenac_> http://pastebin.com/5FrNQ52z
[13:40:16] <apneic> Hi, I have a question about an ajax request.  I'm using beforeSend to fadeOut an element and then fadeIn another element within the fadeIn's callback.  The fadeOut works perfectly, but the fadeIn doesn't seem to finish before the ajax request continues on to the success clause.  Is there something I can do about this?
[13:40:34] <eddiemonge> bowenac_: html?
[13:40:40] <apneic> I'm guessing the fadeIn is started, and the code immediately continues while the animation occurs
[13:41:13] <eddiemonge> apneic: right
[13:41:33] <bowenac_> http://pastebin.com/5Xnr10k9
[13:41:36] <bowenac_> updated paste
[13:41:38] <eddiemonge> apneic: why not change your code so the ajax request is fired in the fadeIn's callback?
[13:41:59] <apneic> eddiemonge: interesting idea.  I might go ahead with that.  But is there anything I can do to force the code to pause while the animation occurs?
[13:42:07] <apneic> eddiemonge: Aside from telling it to sleep for the animation's duration
[13:42:36] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: It was a typo in the URL which I swear I checked up and down a thosuand times. Thought it would have spit out a 404 like usual. Guess it's this depreciated stuff.
[13:42:37] <eddiemonge> bowenac_: try event.preventDefault() for funsies
[13:42:49] <bowenac_> at top of function right?
[13:43:14] <eddiemonge> bowenac_: in the click handler. doesnt matter where in there it is
[13:43:53] <bowenac_> same
[13:44:52] <Dragooon_Mac> Anybody willing to help me test the performance of my jQM site?
[13:45:43] <jshultz> does somebody hae a quick second. I have a mobile site: http://dev.m.ciena.com/ that I upgraded to jquery mobile 1.3. It works on desktop but not on mobile. I touch a menu option, and i get an overlay, and then it stops
[13:47:59] <eddiemonge> bowenac_: link to live site? or use jsfiddle to show the same result failing?
[13:53:22] <Krambiorix> hi , how can i remove '<' and '>' from a string?
[13:53:31] <eddiemonge> replace
[13:54:31] <Changa> how can I use a variable instead of #HOME here $('a[href="#HOME"]').addClass('selected'); ?
[13:55:02] <tw2113> $('a[href="#' + myvar +'"]').addClass('selected');
[14:20:27] <fonko> does anyone knows ISOTOPE?
[14:20:50] <fonko> i really need some help with this plugin, im able to see things right in chromne and firefox but not in ie8
[14:21:02] <fonko> all my images displays overlapped!
[14:21:11] <WebDragon> what about IE9 ?
[14:21:18] <fonko> let me check
[14:21:40] <WebDragon> https://github.com/xdissent/ievms get yourself some vms for IE testing ;)
[14:22:00] <fonko> let me see that, sounds good
[14:22:15] <WebDragon> works great here on fedora 16
[14:22:41] <WebDragon> should work similarly for ubuntu or other linux distros that have virtualbox available
[14:23:10] <WebDragon> but don't expect to be able to use those to test immediately. they take some time for the script to set it all up
[14:23:33] <WebDragon> also you should test in Opera as well as FF/Chrome/IE
[14:23:47] <fonko> ie9 doesnt seem to load at all haha
[14:23:48] <WebDragon> (tho opera's moving to that webkit fork of google's soon)
[14:23:57] <fonko> http://dev.warnermusic.com.mx
[14:24:02] <WebDragon> heh so looks like you have some more diagnostics to do, then :)
[14:24:27] <fonko> "noticias" from the menu that appears in your upper left part of the screen
[14:24:35] <fonko> (third item from the menu)
[14:24:53] <WebDragon> looks a little funky here on opera too
[14:25:46] <fonko> we haven't been asked to develop this one for opera... but all the office in mexico uses IE8 so we are doomed
[14:25:47] <fonko> haha
[14:26:04] <WebDragon> too much going on here for me to help much further -- already after 5 and still working on a client project while the client's still at their own office and can give me feedback
[14:26:17] <WebDragon> no but you should test in opera anyway
[14:26:28] <fonko> why's that?
[14:26:33] <WebDragon> I find I catch most of the bugs that plague ff and chrome by developing with opera and then testing elsewhere
[14:26:48] <fonko> im having already a hard time with ie :(
[14:26:52] <WebDragon> and then, oh look, it works correctly in one additional browser
[14:27:00] <fonko> mmm ijnteresting
[14:27:25] <WebDragon> those VM's for linux will help ENORMOUSLY with the IE testing since they are using real IE versions in separate windows instances so it's about as native as you can get and as real as you can get
[14:27:50] <WebDragon> I'd sometimes have three VM's each with a different IE (7,8,9) running all at the same time during intensive test work
[14:28:02] <WebDragon> anyway, gotta run. good luck with the project. looks fun :)
[14:28:03] <eddiemonge> i find using chrome catches most of the chome bugs
[14:28:34] <WebDragon> eddiemonge: yeah but I run into stuff where if I develop with chrome, things fall down elswhere..
[14:28:41] <WebDragon> this is nominally true for all browsers
[14:28:52] <eddiemonge> quicktime? not html5?
[14:29:04] <WebDragon> however I noticed that things fall down elsewhere less often and not as badly when I devel in opera and then test elsewhere
[14:29:15] <WebDragon> quicktime what?
[14:29:23] <eddiemonge> i prefer to use the browser with the currently best developer tools
[14:29:40] <WebDragon> opera and chrome both have built in developer tools that are quite nice
[14:29:52] <WebDragon> FF is coming along in that regard too
[14:30:06] * WebDragon quite likes opera's dragonfly
[14:30:22] <WebDragon> not sure how that will change once opera migrates to the webkit fork
[14:30:27] <Changa> how do I keep the hash in my links when clicked on them?
[14:30:29] <WebDragon> whose name I can't remember
[14:30:41] <WebDragon> anyway, I'm out :)
[14:30:42] <eddiemonge> blink
[14:30:42] * shoky blinks
[14:30:50] <drager> scott_gonzalez: Hey, you here?
[14:30:50] <eddiemonge> Changa: say wha?
[14:30:57] <fonko> see ya webdragon
[14:31:28] <Changa> eddiemonge - I need to explain it better
[14:31:31] <Changa> ok give me a sec
[14:33:30] <Changa> For example this link - http://www.edizarca.com/karpaz/?l=EN#ACT How do I make my href's dynamic so when clicked on them, the page the user goes to changes to http://www.edizarca.com/karpaz/?l=EN&p=main#ACT for example
[14:33:57] <eddiemonge> still not getting it
[14:34:41] <Changa> just go here http://www.edizarca.com/karpaz/?l=EN#ACT - the ?l=EN defines the page language and #ACT is the submenu in the navigation
[14:34:56] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok. how would I go about mosidying information inside a jquery object?
[14:35:09] <eddiemonge> HAPPYFUNBRO: what do you mean? be more specific
[14:35:27] <eddiemonge> Changa: still not getting what the problem is
[14:35:32] <Changa> ok
[14:35:36] <Changa> let me think of a way
[14:35:47] <dwarder> how lond does jsfiddles live?
[14:35:47] <apneic> Does bind/unbind work only on a single element?
[14:35:59] <dwarder> long*
[14:36:13] <dwarder> do*
[14:36:46] <Changa> eddiemonge can I pm you for a second?
[14:37:05] <eddiemonge> dwarder: how long do you want them to?
[14:37:15] <eddiemonge> apneic: ugh no?
[14:37:22] <dwarder> eddiemonge: forever?
[14:37:45] <eddiemonge> dwarder: why?
[14:37:50] <HAPPYFUNBRO> eddiemonge specifically this object $(id).data("jPlayer.config") in this player implementation: http://jplayer.org/1.2.0/developer-guide/
[14:37:54] <dwarder> eddiemonge: why not?
[14:38:11] <eddiemonge> dwarder: what sort of hackery are you trying to do?
[14:38:16] <dwarder> eddiemonge: to have it in documetation
[14:38:30] <dwarder> eddiemonge: to link to examples
[14:38:42] <eddiemonge> HAPPYFUNBRO: whats your question. and i dont like your name yelling at me :(
[14:38:53] <apneic> eddiemonge: I'm trying to bind function called clickMe to a click on a set of elements.  The first thing clickMe does is unbind the click event on all those elements, and then performs the action, and then rebinds.  But the unbind doesn't seem to be working because I can still click any of the elements.
[14:39:00] <prefix> sorry
[14:39:11] <eddiemonge> dwarder: if you are worried about longevity, why not host your own examples?
[14:39:19] <prefix> eddiemonge I need to change the "isPlaying"
[14:39:27] <prefix> value inside of that object
[14:39:36] <eddiemonge> apneic: you are rebinding the same thing after unbinding it?
[14:39:38] <dwarder> eddiemonge: you wanna talk or what?
[14:39:57] <apneic> eddiemong: Yes, with the idea to deactivate while the rest of the function body is taking place.
[14:40:00] <eddiemonge> prefix: doesnt it have a method to determine if is playing?
[14:40:11] <Changa> Lets say you are on this page - http://www.edizarca.com/karpaz/?l=EN#HOME -  ( you can do the steps I tell you ) notice ?l=EN that defines the language. | When you click on Campaign -> Petition link it takes the browser to http://www.edizarca.com/karpaz/?p=petition , this dismisses the user language preference.   How do I make it so that my hyperlinks keep the existing get variable in the domain
[14:40:11] <Changa> name and adds to it if there is a new variable?
[14:40:13] <eddiemonge> apneic: example?
[14:40:19] <apneic> I'll pastie it
[14:40:47] <Andrew_R> dwarder: your links should be set server side if you need to include the query parameters
[14:40:49] <eddiemonge> Changa: that sounds like a backend question to me
[14:41:13] <Andrew_R> ^^ Changa not dwarder
[14:41:22] <wdkevintwo> Does anyone know the site where you answer a couple questions abotu your software and it will recommend the license you should use?
[14:41:31] <Changa> Andrew_R sorry?
[14:41:40] <Changa> ah
[14:41:59] <Andrew_R> set your query parameters on the server side, not in jquery
[14:42:01] <webstormer> how to denote an optional input element? can I use the attribute optional?
[14:42:02] <eddiemonge> wdkevintwo: MIT
[14:42:13] <eddiemonge> webstormer: more infos
[14:42:38] <bsdbofh> Hey all, trying to get an ajax post to work, basically i'm passing data to a php page and expecting back some data so that the javascript can do it's next bit of work. however my success: function(response) comes back empty.. http://jsfiddle.net/j4pmM/
[14:42:46] <wdkevintwo> eddiemonge, no it was a site with questions
[14:43:02] <eddiemonge> bsdbofh: then look at your php response
[14:43:07] <eddiemonge> did you remember to echo?
[14:43:12] <Changa> Andrew_R but there might be hash in the URL
[14:43:20] <Andrew_R> bsdbofh: if you hit the "getteam.php" directly, does it work?
[14:43:21] <webstormer> eddiemonge: I want to signify, for validation, if a field is optional, so I was wondering if I can use that attribute without causing problems is browsers
[14:43:21] <apneic> eddiemonge: http://pastie.org/7468734
[14:43:23] <bsdbofh> yes, in fact right now the only code in the php page is.. echo "working";
[14:43:31] <bsdbofh> so no matter what happens, it should echo back "working"
[14:43:41] <bsdbofh> the alert() runs, but the box is empty.
[14:44:08] <eddiemonge> webstormer: why not signal when its required instead?
[14:44:25] <eddiemonge> Changa: still backend. the hash shouldnt make a difference
[14:45:33] <eddiemonge> bsdbofh: its failing because you need to sepcifiy datatype if your returned response isnt
[14:46:07] <webstormer> eddiemonge: because 99% of the time the input is required, so instead of writing required 99 times, I'd rather write optional 1 time
[14:46:37] <eddiemonge> webstormer: so youd rather not use a valid tag?
[14:46:46] <Andrew_R> eddiemonge: I don't think that's true, ajax will default to Text after it tries to figure it out automatically, if you don't specify the datatype
[14:46:48] <eddiemonge> use data-optional="true" then
[14:47:31] <bsdbofh> eddiemonge, okay, i'm going to try datatype: "html',
[14:47:37] <bsdbofh> which should treat it as plain text
[14:47:43] <webstormer> eddiemonge: yeah that's fine, I was just curious if it'd break anything (using an invalid attribute)
[14:47:45] <eddiemonge> Andrew_R: bet ya its not here
[14:47:57] <eddiemonge> webstormer: the web
[14:48:31] <bsdbofh> hmm, same problem.
[14:48:52] <bsdbofh> I think i've returned strings from ajax posts before without specifying the datatype
[14:49:03] <Andrew_R> bsdbofh: are you using Firebug or some other developer tool to see the Ajax traffic?
[14:50:04] <Andrew_R> check that it shows a "200" success and that the response is "working"
[14:50:11] <eddiemonge> woot. cali accepted my state taxes finally. only took them 2 months
[14:51:02] <DeltaHeavy> Is there any way to get jQuery 1.4.* from anywhere officially?
[14:51:09] <bsdbofh> Andrew_R, I'm not, I didn't know that firebug could view that. I'll install it right now!
[14:51:19] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: code.jquery.com
[14:52:01] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.4/jquery.min.js
[14:52:05] <eddiemonge> but why would you want to?
[14:52:09] <Andrew_R> the requests will show up in the console tab, and you can expand them to see "Headers", "Request", "Response", etc
[14:52:31] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: I replaced an old version of jQuery with the newest and it blew everything up
[14:52:57] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: then roll back your commit
[14:53:14] <eddiemonge> git checkout -- jquery.js or svn revert jquery.js
[14:53:15] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: Not using git for this specific project.
[14:53:21] <eddiemonge> what????!??!?
[14:53:42] <Andrew_R> DeltaHeavy: try jq 1.8, there were a lot of things removed/changed in jq 1.9
[14:53:45] <DeltaHeavy> A lot of this is work other developers have done but no longer do work for them.
[14:54:12] <snover> hahahahaha. no version control? enjoy that disaster
[14:54:27] <apneic> git isn't the only version control
[14:54:31] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, this site is a gigantic screw up. I convinced him to basically do a re-write of it
[14:54:43] <DeltaHeavy> Going to do it all in Magento now instead of this Interspire garbage
[14:54:45] <bsdbofh> Okay so it looks like the POST is being sent out just fine.
[14:54:54] <prefix> ok. so, how bad of a practice is it to use a reference error to fix a browser-specific bug?
[14:55:24] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: lol you think Magento is better than something?
[14:55:37] <eddiemonge> bsdbofh: so whats the response?
[14:55:43] <Andrew_R> prefix: um, how?
[14:56:07] <bsdbofh> eddiemonge, I don't see one
[14:56:09] <eddiemonge> its so nice outside. i like sitting on my balcony enjoying the perfect weather
[14:56:12] <DeltaHeavy> Ah awesome, everything works now -_-
[14:56:21] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: Yep, but they're all horrid piles of crap it would seem
[14:56:23] <eddiemonge> bsdbofh: what do you mean? dev tools always shows the response
[14:56:30] <bsdbofh> I see response headers.. but nothing else
[14:56:31] <DeltaHeavy> Magento makes me want to kill people
[14:56:32] <eddiemonge> DeltaHeavy: what kind of site?
[14:56:39] <Andrew_R> I played around with Magento when it got to vs 1.0. Trying to figure out how to skin the thing is a nightmare
[14:56:41] <eddiemonge> bsdbofh: where are you looking?
[14:56:44] <DeltaHeavy> No whitespace, no comments in the template files...what the hell
[14:56:48] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: decorgroupinc.com
[14:56:59] <eddiemonge> Andrew_R: Its a bad implementation of Zend. or 1.0 was at least
[14:57:05] <prefix> Andrew_R uh, well, I can only conjecture at why throwing an error works, but it appears that it stops a specific function from executing somewhere
[14:57:16] <bsdbofh> Under NET-ALL, when I click the Link, I see a POST show up
[14:57:16] <prefix> in chrome
[14:57:21] <prefix> only in chrome
[14:57:30] <BabySuperman> I'm loading in HTML via ajax -- how can I wait until those DOM elements are "ready"?
[14:57:32] <DeltaHeavy> eddiemonge: I recently fixed the JS (not the HTML/CSS which in retrospect I should have done) for decorgroupinc.com/store/builders/archmouldings/
[14:57:32] <eddiemonge> prefix: because it stops all code execution
[14:57:35] <bsdbofh> I then expand that POST, and see Response Headers, and Request Headers
[14:57:48] <Andrew_R> prefix: so you are including code that only breaks on Chrome?
[14:57:59] <DeltaHeavy> BabySuperman: Are you trying to attach an event to items you're printing out via AJAX?
[14:58:25] <eddiemonge> i dislike most ecommerce software
[14:58:28] <DeltaHeavy> BabySuperman: Cause if so look into the 'on' event
[14:58:30] <prefix> eddiemonge actually, it doesn't. it only appears to stop code execution for a specific function
[14:58:37] <eddiemonge> bsdbofh: so the actual response is empty then?
[14:58:44] <BabySuperman> DeltaHeavy, I'm loading in html via ajax (replacing content area with divs n such) and I'm loading necessary scripts to execute along with that content, I don't know what DOM elements i may need to wait for
[14:59:14] <eddiemonge> prefix: if it throws an error, execution stops
[14:59:28] <Andrew_R> bsdbofh: is the response code 200 OK?
[14:59:29] <prefix> well, I can't tell you what is happening then
[14:59:32] <DeltaHeavy> BabySuperman: It's always better to ask what you REALLY want rather than the path you thought was best. What you WANT is a .on event. These events will work on new content, even if it was created AFTER the event.
[14:59:40] <prefix> however, it's working
[14:59:42] <apneic> eddiemonge: Any idea why my unbind isn't working properly?
[14:59:47] <bsdbofh> Andrew_R, yeah the response is 200 OK
[14:59:49] <Andrew_R> prefix: sounds like a bad way to do it
[14:59:54] <bsdbofh> eddiemonge, it looks like it
[14:59:59] <DeltaHeavy> BabySuperman: $(<closest parent>).on(<event type>, <actual event trigger element>, function() { <stuff> });
[15:00:05] <BabySuperman> DeltaHeavy, I'm loading in javascript and executing it...
[15:00:11] <prefix> Andrew_R I agree, but I can't, for the life of me, figure out what the hell is going on here.
[15:00:18] <eddiemonge> apneic: store the group as a var and then unbind that whole group
[15:00:21] <DeltaHeavy> BabySuperman: WHAAAA? Don't do that ;_; Why are you doing that
[15:00:24] <eddiemonge> bsdbofh: php?
[15:00:26] <DeltaHeavy> Unless this is some LEGIT LEGIT stuff
[15:00:27] <BabySuperman> DeltaHeavy, Why not?
[15:00:34] <BabySuperman> DeltaHeavy, yes it's a single page app
[15:00:38] <bsdbofh> but again.. getteam.php 's entire contents is… <?php echo "working"; ?>
[15:00:39] <DeltaHeavy> BabySuperman: Cause it's a bad way to do thing assuming you're not making the next FB or something I'd guess.
[15:00:39] <apneic> eddiemonge: I did.  http://pastie.org/7468734
[15:00:46] <eddiemonge> BabySuperman: sounds like you need resource management or something like requireJS to make your life easier
[15:00:51] <bsdbofh> eddiemonge, yeah php
[15:00:55] <BabySuperman> DeltaHeavy, eddiemonge tyvm!  I'll research that
[15:00:57] <eddiemonge> bsdbofh: any php errors in your logs?
[15:01:01] <Andrew_R> bsdbofh: in the Net tab, you should have a "Response" tab after you expand the request that should show what it received
[15:01:12] <Andrew_R> if it's empty, then you didn't receive a response
[15:01:14] <DeltaHeavy> BabySuperman: Ah, nvm then. Perhaps I misjudged exactly what you're trying to do. If you don't know about the '.on' event though it'll for sure help you with this type of stuff.
[15:01:27] <Andrew_R> eddiemonge: if the response was empty, he should have still gotten an empty alert?
[15:01:27] <prefix> Andrew_R / eddiemonge unless you gents care to try you hand at figuring out what the heck is up with this code, I'm going to just roll with it
[15:01:31] <BabySuperman> DeltaHeavy, yep familiar with on event but I don't see how that can help me...
[15:01:34] <eddiemonge> apneic: why do you need to unbind again? cant you just use see ? one
[15:01:35] <bot-t> apneic, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[15:01:49] <BabySuperman> DeltaHeavy, I'm going through the new DOM and executing all the <script> tags but the things those <script> tags are working on arent available yet
[15:02:02] <BabySuperman> deltaheavy, even though they should be... i have to do setTimeout with 1000+ for it to work
[15:02:03] <apneic> eddiemonge: Attaching one to a set of elements gives one event per element, right?  I need all elements to be temporarily disabled.
[15:02:04] <eddiemonge> bsdbofh: try console.log instead of alert. just to see
[15:02:19] <eddiemonge> prefix: i dont know what your issue is
[15:02:47] <eddiemonge> BabySuperman: the scripts are executed before the html is parsed
[15:03:01] <BabySuperman> eddiemonge, i know... how doI tell when it's parsed!!
[15:03:14] <eddiemonge> apneic: why not just set a flag instead of binding/unbinding? better performance
[15:03:15] <DeltaHeavy> BabySuperman: I just see a LOT of questions in other web related channels about people trying to load things via AJAX and their jQuery event's not firing.
[15:03:26] <apneic> eddiemonge: And then use live?
[15:03:31] <eddiemonge> BabySuperman: i dont know. make separate calls?
[15:03:31] <BabySuperman> DeltaHeavy, yeah that's why I know what it is! lol :)
[15:03:39] <BabySuperman> eddiemonge, Make seperate calls?
[15:03:51] <BabySuperman> eddiemonge, Like just keep repeating if it's failing? Idk about that, i can just see a lot of problems
[15:04:14] <eddiemonge> apneic: dont use live. its deprecated
[15:04:24] <apneic> eddiemonge: I'm on 1.4 :-(
[15:04:34] <tw2113> 1.4 should be deprecated
[15:04:46] <eddiemonge> BabySuperman: like call your html/json first then do a getScript call
[15:04:56] <bsdbofh> eddiemonge, Andrew_R, console.log(response); shows "(an empty string)" on the console.
[15:05:10] <BabySuperman> eddiemonge, yep am doing that, oh well, tyvm :)
[15:05:17] <eddiemonge> bsdbofh: live link at this point
[15:05:24] <Andrew_R> bsdbofh: that means your php call isn't returning anything
[15:05:33] <Andrew_R> hit getteam.php directly in the browser
[15:05:39] <Imaginativeone> Do I have to learn ruby to use SASS?
[15:05:45] <eddiemonge> Imaginativeone: lol. no
[15:05:51] <eddiemonge> you have to learn css
[15:05:53] <Andrew_R> *your ajax call to your php page isn't returning anything
[15:07:30] <prefix> eddiemonge / Andrew_R go to http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/ and click play on any of the music players. Then click somewhere ahead or before the current time in the loadbar in the player in the upper right-hand corner. You'll notice that it's "pause" button changes to "play" this should not happen, since the track is still playing. (it only happens in chrome)
[15:08:29] <prefix> welcome to the super-specific bug that has plaghued my life for 10+ hours
[15:09:35] <bsdbofh> eddiemonge, Andrew_R, okay I have a MUCH more fundamental problem here, <?php phpinfo(); ?> returns nothing. really odd, php is working fine on other pages, but not this one. going to troubleshoot.
[15:09:58] <Andrew_R> prefix: unfortunately, nothing is played in Chromium
[15:10:12] <prefix> Andrew_R use chrome
[15:10:29] <Imaginativeone> What's the best resource for learning SASS?
[15:10:47] <edoop> web GL  is available   on   I.E?
[15:10:54] <blindMoe> Imaginativeone: sass-lang.com is pretty good
[15:11:02] <eddiemonge> prefix: maybe you should file a bug with jplayer?
[15:11:08] <edoop> we have   on i:e  the drag function h , and V ?
[15:11:20] <eddiemonge> blindMoe: thats what i said. i reference that bottom section a lot
[15:11:28] <Andrew_R> Chromium is basically the unbranded version of Chrome, but there could be differences I suppose.
[15:11:41] <dclaude> has somebody an idea how i can find out why i get sometimes a "permission denied" in the ready function?
[15:11:45] <bsdbofh> eddiemonge, Andrew_R AARRGGGHHH! That is ANGERING.
[15:12:22] <eddiemonge> prefix: maybe you should also validate your page and get rid of your php errors?
[15:12:26] <bsdbofh> It was a farming FILE PERMISSIONS ISSUE. Coda2 uploaded the file with perms of other=none
[15:12:41] <Imaginativeone> That site talks about installing Ruby...
[15:12:41] <eddiemonge> dclaude: need more informations
[15:12:46] <bsdbofh> so apache processes couldn't read the damn file
[15:12:52] <prefix> eddiemonge can't happen. drupal6
[15:12:59] <bsdbofh> what's really odd is that query still ran the success function
[15:13:02] <prefix> well, I guess no one can figure this bug out
[15:13:05] <Andrew_R> prefix: what is the file that the script is in that does the navigation handling?
[15:13:07] <bsdbofh> that should be a clear fail
[15:13:19] <eddiemonge> bsdbofh: Andrew_R didnt we cover the output of the page a long time ago and determine that it was outputting something? sigh
[15:13:36] <dclaude> eddiemonge: in the application i use the jQuery.ready to initalize the event handler for the elements
[15:13:40] <eddiemonge> Imaginativeone: need it to compile sass but you dont have to know it
[15:13:41] <prefix> Andrew_R jplayer.js and possibly jquery.jplayer.js
[15:13:43] <Andrew_R> eddiemonge: he said it worked...
[15:13:59] <dclaude> if i use IE i have the following problem sometimes
[15:14:08] <eddiemonge> prefix: so you are fine with only half of your page rendering?
[15:14:23] <prefix> half?
[15:14:27] <eddiemonge> bsdbofh: because you didnt throw a http status code
[15:14:27] <dclaude> i click a button to forward to the next page and then click a button to call print()
[15:14:30] <bsdbofh> eddiemonge, Andrew_R, sorry to waste your time. if you're in the bay area, i'll buy you a beer? hehe
[15:14:38] <eddiemonge> prefix: yeah, look at your actual source
[15:14:58] <prefix> eddiemonge I am, and I'm not seeing any problems.
[15:14:59] <eddiemonge> dclaude: link? example?
[15:15:08] <prefix> could you print a screenshot please?
[15:15:33] <dclaude> unfortunately i wasn't successfully to isolate the problem and to prepare an example
[15:15:45] <eddiemonge> bsdbofh: but not me :( and i am
[15:15:48] <Andrew_R> prefix: where did you put your javascript error hack?
[15:15:50] <saba> I got something interesting. I press ctrl+a in a text input in Chrome and my keyup event receives two objects, none of which has the ctrlKey set to true. The second object has keyCode=65/a but the first object has keyCode=17, which is device control 1, eg the XON key. I can repeat this, however it does not happen every time.
[15:15:56] <saba> Any ideas on this behaviour?
[15:15:57] <prefix> Andrew_R I took it out for you
[15:15:58] <dclaude> because i don't have an idea how this could happen
[15:16:06] <Andrew_R> I know, but where was it?
[15:16:07] <bsdbofh> eddiemonge, don't drink? hehe

[15:16:23] <eddiemonge> stops there

[15:16:28] <dclaude> i read a lot about a similar problem if using frames
[15:16:31] <Andrew_R> bsdbofh: you have to come to Minneapolis :)
[15:16:41] <dclaude> but i don't use frames
[15:16:48] <twisted`> does someone here know how Google might respond to hiding a keyword (just one) from a page using jQuery?
[15:17:00] <saba> Why would a browser every send the DC1/XON key?
[15:17:07] <bsdbofh> Andrew_R, well, I may need to waste a couple more hours of your time to justify the expense. But no doubt I could come up with that many jquery questions haha ;)
[15:17:07] <prefix> eddiemonge oh yeah. those errors are fine for now.
[15:17:14] <saba> ever*
[15:17:19] <Andrew_R> :)
[15:17:28] <shoky> saba: use keypress
[15:17:36] <prefix> eddiemonge meaning: they do not affect this particular issue
[15:17:39] <shoky> saba: or keydown maybe
[15:17:45] <nerk> google algorithms and bot semantics change rapidly
[15:17:52] <saba> shoky: why?
[15:17:59] <nerk> too hard to tell what google might do with that condition.
[15:18:35] <dclaude> so how can it happen that the ready function is executed and the access to document.body is denied?
[15:18:40] <prefix> Andrew_R lines 259 and 285
[15:18:53] <prefix> Andrew_R in jquery.js
[15:19:25] <Andrew_R> I see... Maybe an e.stopPropagation(); in that click event?
[15:19:38] <Andrew_R> because throwing the error should do that
[15:19:53] <prefix> ok
[15:19:59] <prefix> let's give it a whirl
[15:20:02] <dwarder> how do i "POP IT UP" automatically when page finished it's loading http://jsfiddle.net/SK4V9/ i tried .trigger() with no luck ...
[15:20:05] <dwarder> please help
[15:20:22] <shoky> saba: also, 17 is ctrl
[15:20:39] <prefix> Andrew_R no dice
[15:21:39] <eddiemonge> too many conversations
[15:22:18] <eddiemonge> dclaude: whats your code?
[15:22:56] <prefix> Andrew_R any other ideas?
[15:22:59] <saba> shoky: aha, that explains it. Why do you think keypress will solve my problem?
[15:23:42] <eddiemonge> dwarder: http://jsfiddle.net/SK4V9/2/
[15:23:45] <shoky> saba: well scratch that for now. what's the problem?
[15:23:58] <Andrew_R> prefix: there are 2 click events being handled, I'm trying to figure out the other one
[15:24:11] <prefix> kk
[15:24:29] <prefix> Andrew_R fyi this is my code
[15:24:40] <prefix> and it's pretty, uh, complex.
[15:25:01] <saba> shoky: my problem is that the native behaviour of ctrl+a in an input in Chrome is sometimes disturbed by my keyup handler. This handler always returns true
[15:25:04] <dwarder> eddiemonge: thanks, what did you do? the code looks completly different
[15:25:10] <dclaude> eddiemonge: what do you want to know exactly?
[15:25:27] <eddiemonge> dwarder: moved your chunk after the plugin
[15:25:33] <dwarder> ohh
[15:25:37] <eddiemonge> dclaude: im trying to figure out your problem
[15:25:37] <dwarder> eddiemonge: thanks
[15:25:45] <eddiemonge> dwarder: and clicked tidyup
[15:25:46] <shoky> saba: jsfiddle it.. i dont know what your handler is doing, and what it's disturbing
[15:26:04] <eddiemonge> dclaude: do you have a link to your site?
[15:26:19] <dwarder> eddiemonge: ... now i need to close it after 10 seconds ... will try to figure out how ...
[15:26:33] <dclaude> no, it is now in the www
[15:26:48] <dclaude> it is a bank application
[15:26:48] <eddiemonge> dwarder: setTimeout()
[15:26:55] <dclaude> not in the www
[15:26:58] <dclaude> sorry
[15:27:12] <eddiemonge> dclaude: maybe thts why? its not able to load jquery or something?
[15:27:22] <prefix> Andrew_R .jPlayer("playHeadTime", is not my code (it's part of jplayer). it is possible that once that function executes, it causes other functions to execute (which likely changes the display style on the button)
[15:27:41] <dclaude> the application works fine most of the time
[15:27:57] <dclaude> the jQuery file is part of the application
[15:28:16] <dclaude> the problem is inside of the jQuery file
[15:28:22] <dclaude> in the ready function
[15:28:43] <dclaude> we have a script block in the head of every html file
[15:29:20] <dclaude> which uses jQuery(document).ready to initalize our app
[15:29:42] <dclaude> and as said, this works fine most of the time
[15:30:01] <dclaude> but there is a kind of race condition i guess
[15:30:08] <Andrew_R> prefix: if you set a breakpoint in that function where you added e.stopPropagation(), and step through until you get to jQuery code, you'll see it calls another handler function after that one completes, and that is where the button gets set back to Play instead of Pause
[15:31:04] <dclaude> if i submit a form and click a button to call print() sometimes our initalization is not made
[15:31:25] <Andrew_R> prefix: try changing e.stopPropagation() to e.stopImmediatePropagation()
[15:31:30] <dclaude> because of an permission denied error in the line: if ( !document.body ) {
[15:31:30] <eddiemonge> dclaude: thats like three different things in that last statement
[15:31:58] <eddiemonge> dclaude: itd be helpful if you could paste some example code
[15:32:12] <GOMADWarrior> is $("#MyCanvas"); the same as document.getElementById("MyCanvas"); ?
[15:32:38] <Andrew_R> GOMADWarrior: no, the first one returns a jquery object, the second one returns a DOM object
[15:33:13] <dclaude> eddiemonge: you are right
[15:33:19] <eddiemonge> GOMADWarrior: similar
[15:33:35] <prefix> Andrew_R what is the other handler function?
[15:34:01] <Andrew_R> prefix: I couldn't figure it out, not that familiar with Chrome dev tools
[15:34:16] <blindMoe> time to familiarize
[15:34:37] <Andrew_R> stopImmediatePropagation() should prevent it from calling any additional handlers though
[15:34:44] <Andrew_R> blindMoe: I like Firebug
[15:34:54] <prefix> Andrew_R stopImmediatePropagation() seems to work
[15:34:58] <blindMoe> I love lamp
[15:35:00] <Andrew_R> sweet
[15:35:05] <prefix> big ups to Andrew_R
[15:35:09] <prefix> :)
[15:35:30] <eddiemonge> Andrew_R: learn CDT and you wont go back to firebug
[15:36:13] <Andrew_R> can you move CDT to a separate window?
[15:36:22] <eddiemonge> yup
[15:36:28] <eddiemonge> even to a separate computer
[15:36:41] <shoky> you can even CDT the CDT
[15:37:15] <shoky> dawg
[15:37:29] <Andrew_R> I can get by in CDT, but maybe I should spend more time with it
[15:37:54] <eddiemonge> best way to learn it, watch some paul_irish talks on it.
[15:38:03] <eddiemonge> plus you get to listen to paul. added bonus
[15:38:05] <shoky> +1
[15:38:45] <Andrew_R> I've been using Firebug since like version 0.4 or something
[15:39:12] <blindMoe> I can't stand firebug any more.. it is so slow compared to CDT
[15:39:29] <eddiemonge> i was too. first time i tried cdt i thought it sucked and went back to firebug. one day i tried using nothing but cdt and havent looked back
[15:40:38] <Andrew_R> OK, I'll have to give it another chance
[15:41:16] <eddiemonge> builtin speed is worth it alone
[15:41:25] <eddiemonge> not having to click enable is awesome as well
[15:42:56] <shay_> hi, can someone please give me an idea how I can see the rest of the values of files[0] in a readable format (firebug works too) in the following: $this.find(':file').nextUntil('input:hidden','input.file:text').val($.parseJSON(this.jqXHR.responseText).files[0].image_src);
[15:43:10] <shay_> I'm not exactly sure how to view the contents
[15:43:51] <eddiemonge> shay_: im not sure what you are doing. console.log()?
[15:45:27] <shay_> nm figured it out: alert(JSON.stringify($.parseJSON(this.jqXHR.responseText).files[0], null, 4));
[15:45:31] <shay_> thanks
[15:47:27] <eddiemonge> lol json stringify a parsed json from a string
[15:50:28] <dclaude> eddiemonge: i prepared something on jsfiddle, nothing what you can run, but maybe it helps to understand, what our application does
[15:50:29] <dclaude> http://jsfiddle.net/yAjzq/
[15:51:39] <dwarder> eddiemonge: my try with settimeout http://jsfiddle.net/CGCLK/
[15:53:32] <eddiemonge> dwarder: you should look to see if there is an actual close method
[15:54:39] <dwarder> eddiemonge: looks like i need this : New way to force popup to close. Force close by calling the public function close(), $(selector).bPopup().close(), instead of triggering the close event with $('.bClose').closePopup(). This will stop cluttering up the $.fn namespace.
[15:54:42] <eddiemonge> dclaude: doesnt really help. are those function bound in that init function?
[15:54:47] <dwarder> from http://dinbror.dk/blog/bPopup/
[15:54:55] <dclaude> yes
[15:55:22] <dclaude> the info is found in the data-action attribute
[15:57:15] <eddiemonge> what info? i dont really know what you are trying to do there?
[15:57:41] <dwarder> eddiemonge: i tried the actual close method, maybe something wrong with setTimeout ? http://jsfiddle.net/CGCLK/
[15:57:58] <dclaude> in the data-action attribute is the name of the function which is bound by the init function
[15:59:01] <dclaude> means, if the init function is not executed, the buttons are out of order
[15:59:10] <dclaude> because no action is bound
[16:00:08] <dclaude> after the page is loaded, jQuery.ready calls the init function and the corresponding functions are bound to the buttons
[16:00:17] <dclaude> the forward button is only for submitting the form
[16:00:34] <dclaude> and the print button to call print(), to print the curren tpage
[16:00:36] <dclaude> page
[16:01:35] <dclaude> my test case is to click first the forward button
[16:01:51] <dclaude> and then the print button
[16:02:05] <dclaude> sometimes the forward is done before the print dialog appears
[16:02:47] <eddiemonge> ?mdc setTimeout @ dwarder
[16:02:49] <bot-t> dwarder, window.setTimeout - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - Calls a function or executes a code snippet after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.setTimeout
[16:02:54] <dclaude> sometimes the print dialog apperars first, the submit is suspended until the print dialog is closed
[16:03:52] <dclaude> and sometimes i get a permission denied in the ready function of jQuery as mentioned earlier
[16:04:17] <dwarder> eddiemonge: so i have mistake in setTimeout?
[16:04:32] <eddiemonge> dclaude: but how are you doing the actual bindings?
[16:04:35] <eddiemonge> dwarder: yes
[16:07:16] <dclaude> eddiemonge: it is a lot of code, do you really want to see it?
[16:07:29] <eddiemonge> dclaude: you cant do a simple example of it?
[16:07:37] <dclaude> i will try
[16:11:43] <dwarder> eddiemonge: here i used onOpen to trigger my timeout http://jsfiddle.net/P9GsC/
[16:12:15] <eddiemonge> dwarder: dont do that
[16:12:28] <eddiemonge> you just overwrote the default setTimeout function
[16:12:36] <eddiemonge> that is a builtin js method
[16:12:44] <dwarder> ohh
[16:13:21] <dwarder> eddiemonge: i did it http://jsfiddle.net/P9GsC/
[16:13:24] <dwarder> eddiemonge: thanks :)
[16:13:39] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/P9GsC/1/
[16:15:47] <dclaude> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/yAjzq/1/
[16:15:59] <dclaude> i hope it helps
[16:16:03] <mfranz> Hi all: I have been messing around with collapible elements, I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/8VfLm/11/ the issue is that the data for the div generally comes from an ajax request which works once, but if I change the patient_id that I pass to the load_surgery_accord function when the page is refreshed the old div elements are still there and the new data while it is returned via ajax is not
[16:16:03] <mfranz> inserted
[16:16:41] <dwarder> eddiemonge: i like you version better, thank a lot
[16:16:57] <mfranz> I have tried multiple combinations of $(#collabsible).empty / reset etc to wipe out the old data but this doesn't seem to do anything, it does wipe the old stuff out but then the new stuff isn't inserted
[16:17:03] <mfranz> ideas?
[16:19:29] <eddiemonge> dclaude: wow thats confusing
[16:20:57] <dclaude> as i said
[16:21:17] <dclaude> but in fact it is really easy ;)
[16:22:03] <dclaude> first all relevant buttons are selected and all old binding removed (unbind)
[16:22:05] <DeltaHeavy> dclaude: You know you can write multiple variables with only one 'var' statement eh?
[16:22:20] <DeltaHeavy> var x = 0,\n\ty = 4
[16:22:25] <dclaude> yes, i know, but i am not a big fan of it
[16:22:26] <DeltaHeavy> Assuming you can parse \n\t in your mind @_@
[16:22:41] <DeltaHeavy> Also you need more whitespace. That stuff is blah to look at
[16:24:35] <eddiemonge> dclaude: why are you even storing that stuff in the dom? why not just make it purely in js?
[16:25:05] <dclaude> it is an 10 year old app, which has a java backend
[16:25:23] <dclaude> and uses struts to generate the html pages
[16:25:43] <dclaude> the current state is after a first big refactoring
[16:27:40] <dclaude> i don't want to have the information in the dom at all, but there was not enough budget to do rebuild it more than that
[16:28:21] <dclaude> i agree, there is a lot of code
[16:28:38] <dclaude> but all it does is to bind functions as handlers to the buttons
[16:29:41] <dclaude> there can be more information on the button elements to control confirmation dialogs, warning dialogs and so on
[16:29:57] <dclaude> but i don't tink it is relevant for the problem
[16:30:00] <dclaude> hopefully
[16:31:05] <dclaude> DeltaHeavy: Where do you need more white space?
[16:31:21] <DeltaHeavy> dclaude: Just in general to make your code a little more readable.
[16:32:19] <dclaude> this is not the original code
[16:32:46] <dclaude> just pasted together the relevant stuff
[16:35:23] <dclaude> DeltaHeavy: do you mean white space or blank lines?
[16:37:54] <dclaude> or do you mean something like that?: bind: function ( button ) {
[16:40:14] <dclaude> i am from the java world and therefore used to that format
[16:40:29] <dclaude> sorry :)
[16:46:39] <dclaude> hello?
[16:47:37] <dclaude> seems all people went to bed
[16:48:02] <juboba> how can I add a button to a dialog already opened?
[17:09:37] <GOMADWarrior> i hate it when it doesn't work but there's no error
[17:42:05] <juboba> how can I add a button to a dialog already opened?
[17:55:04] <ionico> hi, i have a problem,  i dont a any loop , but when i call an ajax request i have an alert,  all fine but when i call that function again it showsme the previus alert, and the new, and so on , it is like storing the result and be called again,  that's a nightmare,  do you know whats wrong???
[17:58:14] <juboba> how can I add a button to a dialog already opened?
[18:15:13] <chigambamukoko_> greetings to all in the name of the creator
[18:16:31] <chigambamukoko_> I am trying to get a 3 drop downs to work with php/mysql and jqery, anyone willing to give me a hand?
[18:19:34] <chigambamukoko_> anyone that can help me with a one on one jquery/mysql/php drop down list please contact me privately
[19:12:26] <cHiKNPad> hi .. i have a very large list of people names and I would like to have a search box using autocomplete but there is no way i could load all the names on the page in the background .. is there a lightweight way to autocomplete against a mysql db?
[19:14:08] <mbrzuzy> cHiKNPad there is really only one way to retrieve the data.  You could always cache results
[19:16:24] <cHiKNPad> heh must be a way .. google doesn't store the world so it can autocomplete
[19:17:30] <chigambamukoko_> cHiKNPad: https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki, don't know if this will help you or not
[19:18:26] <cHiKNPad> i will look at it chigambamukoko_ thanks
[19:18:26] <chigambamukoko_> I ran accross it the other day
[19:19:23] <chigambamukoko_> cHiKNPad, question for you, I am trying to get a 3 drop down using php/mysql and javascript/jquery, do you have any ideas?
[19:20:08] <cHiKNPad> nice ha .. someone made http://www.jqueryautocomplete.com
[19:20:30] <cHiKNPad> heheh ahhhhh everything has a website now
[19:21:19] <cHiKNPad> well thank you mbrzuzy and chigambamukoko i will see if i can do some testing
[19:24:38] <even_> anybody knows why this map is being displayed correctly only the first time i click the tab http://jsfiddle.net/QLMQH/102/
[19:28:54] <br3ntor> When I try and add an id or class to my div it doesn't work in the same way as the original set of code.  What am I doint wrong?
[19:28:59] <br3ntor> http://cssdeck.com/labs/0qkq2fh4
[19:29:59] <br3ntor> makin the div id="planet" or whatever and then updating the css and jQuery I would think it would work the same
[21:19:41] <ionico> hi, i dont know what is happening,  but i have place an alert inside an ajax call but each time i call that ajax function show all previus alerts dialog, whats wrong? i dont have any loop or something that may cause that.
[21:22:16] <nights> could someone help me with this
[21:22:16] <nights> http://jsfiddle.net/gVeVb/
[21:22:23] <nights> why i cant get the item_id
[21:22:44] <nights> $this works fine
[21:22:53] <nights> and closest should work
[21:22:55] <nights> but it doesnt
[21:22:59] <nights> dont get it
[21:24:29] <jollis> not sure if this is intentional, but your line 9 ends with .attr("itemid");, but your alert is trying to output item_id
[21:24:55] <nights> thanks
[21:24:57] <nights> what do you mean?
[21:25:02] <nights> the attr is itemid
[21:25:11] <nights> sure, the js variable is item_id
[21:25:13] <nights> but thats not a problem
[21:29:28] <ionico> hi, i dont know what is happening,  but i have place an alert inside an ajax call but each time i call that ajax function show all previus alerts dialog, whats wrong? i dont have any loop or something that may cause that.
[21:30:12] <sahbeewah> nights, what's the problem? seems to work
[21:30:28] <nights> hm yeah :(
[21:30:39] <nights> strangely it doesnt work live
[21:31:16] <avro> your looking for #bodycontainer which doesn't exist in your demo
[21:31:39] <nights> yes
[21:31:46] <nights> sorry you can replace it with just body
[21:31:51] <nights> thats not the problem in live
[21:31:56] <avro> well it worked when i did that
[21:32:09] <nights> yes
[21:32:12] <nights> dont get it :(
[21:32:37] <nights> how can it not work in live but on jsfiddle
[21:32:42] <nights> cant think of any reason
[21:33:21] <nights> $(this) gets me the right element
[21:33:27] <nights> then i just use closest
[21:33:33] <nights> and that works in jsfiddle but not on my site
[21:34:19] <sahbeewah> whats the site?
[21:34:33] <sahbeewah> ionico, code?
[21:34:33] <nights> its not online right now
[21:36:35] <nights> WEIRD
[21:36:36] <nights> got
[21:36:37] <nights> god
[21:36:41] <nights> its driving me crazy
[21:38:38] <nights> funny
[21:38:44] <nights> on production
[21:38:58] <nights> this  works
[21:38:59] <nights> alert( $(this).parent().html() );
[21:39:14] <nights> but not alert( $(this).parent('.menuitem_content').html() );
[21:40:16] <nights> ok
[21:40:17] <nights> it works now
[21:40:23] <nights> wtf was the problem.
[21:41:38] <nights> suddenly it works and i dont know what the difference was
[21:41:41] <nights> :(
[21:41:50] <nights> probably chrome messed up somehow
[22:32:54] <ruby_on_tails> can anyone tell me why the accordian isnt smoothly sliding in FF ? http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/vertical-accordion-menu-using-jquery-css3 5 lines of jquery
[23:05:55] <Dragooon_Mac> Hmm..I'm having pretty choppy scrolling performance on a page with only a listview
[23:06:10] <Dragooon_Mac> Using jQuery Mobile 1.3.1
[23:06:31] <Dragooon_Mac> Anybody? http://smf-media.com/community/index.php?board=32.0;theme=4
[23:06:42] <Dragooon_Mac> (On a touch device, on desktop it's fine)
[23:18:06] <codedreamer> im getting doublescrollbars on that link
[23:18:12] <codedreamer> maybe they are fighting each other
[23:19:53] <Dragooon_Mac> codedreamer: What do you mean?
[23:20:15] <codedreamer> im getting 2 vertical scrollbars
[23:20:19] <codedreamer> in chromium
[23:20:32] <Dragooon_Mac> Ugh what the crap?
[23:20:38] <codedreamer> maybe you have an overflow css attribute somewhere
[23:20:47] <Dragooon_Mac> I'm using a panel
[23:20:58] <Dragooon_Mac> I don't have any overflow in my CSS
[23:21:41] <codedreamer> then maybe you should add one to overflow: hidden;
[23:22:33] <Dragooon_Mac> codedreamer: Can you try now?
[23:22:52] <codedreamer> fixed
[23:22:59] <Dragooon_Mac> Definitely the panel
[23:23:28] <codedreamer> add an css overflow attribute to its surounding container
[23:24:07] <Dragooon_Mac> Let me try
[23:24:47] <Dragooon_Mac> Can you try now?
[23:25:01] <codedreamer> its back
[23:25:10] <Dragooon_Mac> Hm, I have an overflow: hidden there
[23:25:23] <codedreamer> on what class/id?
[23:25:44] <Dragooon_Mac> The div with data-role="panel", currently just using style attribute
[23:26:16] <codedreamer> maybe add a !important
[23:26:42] <codedreamer> also its safe to assume jquery is doing somethign to it as well
[23:26:50] <Foxhoundz> !important is evil
[23:26:50] <b-ot> Foxhoundz: memorised â€œimportantâ€.
[23:26:55] <Foxhoundz> oh god
[23:27:10] <Dragooon_Mac> Yeah, I might get rid of it all together
[23:27:10] <Dragooon_Mac> Anyway, try now?
[23:27:28] <codedreamer> still there
[23:27:39] <Dragooon_Mac> Bleh screw it
[23:27:43] <codedreamer> its on the full page height
[23:27:50] <codedreamer> likes its on html or body
[23:37:00] <Dragooon_Mac> codedreamer: Can you try now?
[23:45:28] <codedreamer> gone
