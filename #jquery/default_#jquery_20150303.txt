[00:39:15] <Omar-> morning!
[00:40:06] <Kamuela> does .off() automatically clear all event handlers on a given element?
[00:40:49] <Cork> "automatically"?
[00:40:58] <Cork> it removes all event handlers jquery knows about
[00:41:13] <Kamuela> so if this is the last include, it should?
[00:41:27] <Cork> uh include?
[00:41:34] <Cork> not sure what you're talking about
[00:42:20] <Kamuela> <script src="thelastinclude></script></body>
[00:42:51] <Cork> well it removes the event handlers at that time, that jquery knows about
[00:43:09] <Cork> not sure why you would want that, but... ya
[00:43:30] <Kamuela> working on a project with multiple inline js and trying to consolidate ajax functionality for form submits
[00:43:57] <Kamuela> so possibly off('submit') may work more precisely
[00:45:17] <Cork> Kamuela: uh, why not just remove the inline js?
[00:45:26] <Cork> instead of patching over there existence
[00:45:37] <Kamuela> Cork: that certainly comes next, but this is iterative development
[00:46:05] <Cork> if the inline js adds .submit or .on('submit' or .bind('submit
[00:46:12] <Cork> then sure .off('submit' works fine
[00:46:26] <Cork> if they do .onsubmit or .addEventListener your out of luck though
[00:46:52] <Kamuela> i'm basically catching all form submits and making them post and respond with this, it's to add a notification widget for failures and successes
[00:48:55] <flexpaint> i have identical toggles on my page but one is behaving like "show" for some reason
[00:49:05] <flexpaint> im new and not really sure how to troubleshoot this... no console errors
[00:51:20] <Uhkis> ?demo @ flexpaint
[00:51:20] <b-ot> flexpaint: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:51:34] <flexpaint> oops sorry
[00:51:42] <flexpaint> http://podliberty.com/liberate/
[00:51:49] <flexpaint> "all podcasts" is the working one
[00:51:53] <flexpaint> top left button is behaving like show
[00:52:00] <flexpaint> the three lines thing
[00:52:37] <Uhkis> can't establish a connection to the server at podliberty.com
[00:53:13] <flexpaint> its being wonky for me too, refresh should fix it
[00:53:52] <Uhkis> ok works now
[00:54:02] <flexpaint> cheap hosting :p
[00:57:02] <flexpaint> i thought it was because i was using a id but span id behaves the same
[00:57:27] <flexpaint> maybe it needs a div
[00:57:32] <Uhkis> flexpaint: that ul of yours drops on the button and can't be clicked anymore
[00:57:45] <flexpaint> oh seriously...
[00:59:07] <flexpaint> it has a margin though. css is not my forte
[01:00:21] <Uhkis> 32px margin-left to #nav1 should do it
[01:01:07] <flexpaint> Uhkis, nice. i appreciate the help.
[01:02:34] <Uhkis> flexpaint: but why would you give more details here than in #drupal? ;)
[01:03:05] <flexpaint> i wasnt sure if it was a problem with the behaviors thing
[01:03:13] <flexpaint> i honestly know nothing about web dev/design. sorry
[01:03:29] <Uhkis> clearly you do! :)
[01:04:16] <flexpaint> just a lot of copying and pasting lol
[01:05:09] <fps> hi, i'm new to jquery ui. what docs should i read if i want to implement a list of items with a filter function on top [where the user can type to filter entries]
[01:08:45] <Chulbul> If I echo inside <textarea>this text is recieved after ajax post</texarea> from ck editor but when I type and post the data, my code is not recieing any data, any idea?
[01:09:41] <Cork> Chulbul: you could just grab the text from the ckeditor and do formdata.append('what-ever-you-want-to-call-the-key', text)
[01:10:05] <Cork> no need to create a textarea element if you don't need it for anything else
[01:12:10] <Chulbul> Cork, great, thats working, thanks :)
[01:45:04] <fps> oh ok, jquery mobile.. i was confused by the name at first, but it's usable on non mobile devices, too :)
[02:03:55] <ythej> anyone online ?
[02:22:58] <d3m0n> I am trying to figure out the best way to load content from another page into a div or iframe. If I use div, then I am putting invaild HTML inside a div. If I use iframe I can't use ajax to utilize errors and success. Anyone have a suggestion?
[02:27:39] <Cork> d3m0n: you shouldn't ever load a full page into the same page
[02:27:55] <Cork> d3m0n: if you need the full html, or even if you need separate css
[02:27:58] <Cork> you should use iframe
[02:28:10] <Cork> there isn't a reliable way to do that without
[02:28:11] <d3m0n> Yeah bleh
[02:28:22] <Cork> you can load fragments though, but that isn't the same thing
[02:28:33] <Cork> (fragments/partials)
[02:29:11] <d3m0n> Is there anyway to ajax the process of the iframe loading?
[02:29:26] <d3m0n> IE, ajax the .html file, put the contents into the iframe
[02:31:31] <Cork> d3m0n: why would you want to?
[02:31:45] <Cork> iframe is a full web page it is meant to load the html file it self
[02:32:07] <Cork> if you inject html into it you would have the same problem you get with normal ajax (it expects partials not full pages)
[02:32:37] <Cork> d3m0n: you should prob explain the problem a bit
[02:32:46] <Cork> there might be a better solution to the problem you have
[02:33:05] <d3m0n> I guess my mode of thinking is I use ajax I can control how it's loaded visually
[02:33:14] <d3m0n> IE, loading bar
[02:33:28] <d3m0n> Also can show errors if theres a problem loading
[02:33:31] <Cork> you can do much of that with iframes too
[02:33:38] <Cork> it has load and error events
[02:34:19] <Cork> (ajax was first implemented with hidden iframes as backend ;) )
[02:34:33] <Cork> before xmlhttprequest was invented
[02:34:41] <ythej> Cork, ping
[02:34:58] <Cork> ?
[02:35:12] <Cork> why are you pinging me?
[02:35:13] <ythej> Cork, Hi :)
[02:35:24] <ythej> Cork, I need a little help
[02:35:25] <d3m0n> Ok thanks Cork, I'll look up those events.
[02:35:32] <Cork> ?ask @ ythej
[02:35:32] <b-ot> ythej: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:35:53] <Cork> d3m0n: good luck
[02:36:19] <ythej> where can I ping Jˆrn Zaefferer or Leonardo Balter ?
[02:36:31] <Cork> O_o
[02:36:41] <ythej> I like to take part in GSoC 2015
[02:37:22] <Cork> ythej: https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List
[02:38:08] <ythej> Cork, I saw that :) , on next step I would like to ping mentor related that project :)
[02:38:52] <Cork> ythej: i don't think you will find them on irc
[02:39:04] <Cork> the link i gave you has instructions for how to apply
[02:39:10] <Cork> irc isn't the way
[02:39:26] <Uhkis> http://bassistance.de/about/
[02:41:19] <ythej> Uhkis, Thank you :) I will mail him :)
[02:59:53] <raheel> what to use for reverse ajax?
[03:09:07] <Cork> raheel: reverse??
[03:09:18] <Cork> to ajax from the server to the browser?
[03:14:30] <ythej> where can I start contributing?
[03:14:53] <Cork> ythej: look at the website there is links for exactly that
[04:15:29] <Omar-> !ping arschmitz
[04:21:15] <Omar-> !tell arschmitz overriding hideDuringFocus doesn't prevent fixed toolbars from hiding http://jsbin.com/ficuse/1/edit?html,output
[04:21:15] <b-ot> Omar-: I‚Äôll tell arschmitz about that.
[04:36:27] <Omar-> hello all
[04:37:53] <fps> hmm, does jquery support adding an interval timer "to an element" such that the timer stops triggering when the element is removed?
[06:06:25] <BrazenBraden> having a bit of trouble with bubbling click event. I am triggering the click manually and have tried using .triggerHandler('click') instead as that is not mean to bubble but it has no effect. Also, using stopPropogation stops everything from working... what should I do?  https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/c08bb51612c3e68ee988
[06:07:03] <hjf_> I'm using jquery ui's "autocomplete". I want to replace the default function ("update the text field") with a link
[06:07:16] <Cork> BrazenBraden: you bind even on click?
[06:07:27] <Cork> that is usually not a good choice
[06:07:53] <BrazenBraden> how so? I have always done  $.on('click', foo)
[06:08:02] <hjf_> what function can i use to simulate a reguar <a> link? submit() submits the form, i don't want that
[06:08:11] <Cork> BrazenBraden: but why are you faking the click event?
[06:08:54] <Cork> hjf_: check the api page for _render
[06:09:10] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-_renderItem
[06:09:22] <BrazenBraden> Cork because of the situation. If a user selects a previous customer, then I need to populate all fields witha a copy of that data (basically copying the customer) and some of the fields are cocoon fields (which dont exist until the a.add_fields button is clicked
[06:09:58] <Cork> BrazenBraden: why not just delegate the event handlers?
[06:10:17] <BrazenBraden> delegate to whom?
[06:10:32] <joephilly> to me
[06:10:34] <Cork> a static parent
[06:10:40] <Cork> ?api delegate
[06:10:40] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:10:52] <Cork> read that page if you haven't used it before ^
[06:11:07] * BrazenBraden reads
[06:11:49] <hjf_> Cork: meh i just replaced the function with window.location
[06:12:09] <BrazenBraden> Cork, I have seen this before.. but I ignored it because "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method. "
[06:12:26] <Cork> BrazenBraden: ya, not straight .on
[06:12:33] <Cork> that is where ppl often make the mistake
[06:12:41] <Cork> .on is a combination of .bind and .delegate
[06:12:51] <Cork> and it pickes what to do based on the arguments you pass it
[06:12:57] <BrazenBraden> yea, saw .bind is old hat too
[06:13:05] <Cork> no
[06:13:11] <Cork> bind is what you are using
[06:13:21] <BrazenBraden> by using .on
[06:13:29] <Cork> after reading the .delegate page check the DELEGATE syntax for .on
[06:13:40] <Cork> your currently using the bind syntax for on
[06:13:40] <BrazenBraden> hmm ok
[06:15:14] <BrazenBraden> interesting... my whole life has been a lie :-O
[06:18:01] <Anish_> HEy
[06:18:10] <Anish_> I would like to contribut
[06:18:17] <BrazenBraden> my whole pc came to a crawl.. forgot I had left an infinite loop running in one of my tabs :P
[06:18:18] <Anish_> can some one get me started ?
[06:18:46] <BillCriswell> Anish_: How would you like to contribute?
[06:19:38] <Anish_> I would like to contribute to jQuery UI - new demo system
[06:21:40] <BrazenBraden> is there a way to kill all javascript from the chome dev tools console?
[06:22:19] <Anish_> BillCriswell: Is there a way ?
[06:23:19] <BillCriswell> Anish_: I'd probably start off asking here or maybe even just trying to submit a pull request. I never tried myself. I should, though. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
[06:23:26] <BillCriswell> By here I mean that url.
[06:45:40] <OOPMan> Hey all, has anyone had an issue where mousemove events bound to the document object do not fire?
[06:46:01] <OOPMan> I've worked out that it's only happening on some of my pages so obviously there is some problem code in my project
[06:46:14] <OOPMan> Just wondering if anyone has encountered such a weird issue before and has any advice?
[06:49:27] <OOPMan> Wow
[06:49:34] <OOPMan> I just discovered the source of my problem
[06:49:59] <OOPMan> Some retard written a buggy chrome extension that I happy to be using which causes mousemove events to fail
[06:50:07] <OOPMan> I don't even
[06:52:37] <joephilly> all chrome extensions are buggy and shitty
[06:52:42] <joephilly> because they're written in JS
[06:54:00] <Cork> joephilly: one doesn't incur the other
[07:02:17] <BrazenBraden> Cork, when specifying an element using the deferred .on method, i get a console.log for all the elements created and the code in my callbacks don't feel like firing :(
[07:03:01] <Cork> BrazenBraden: $('#static-parent').on('click', '.class-matching-the-dynamic-elements', func)
[07:03:12] <Cork> that should work exactly like if you bound the event on that element
[07:03:39] <BrazenBraden> let me double check the code quick..
[07:04:53] <Arxane> Hey guys need a bit of help http://jsfiddle.net/u8d79zkg/1/ i draw image from this js file but i have it posisitioned wrong is vertical and it should be horizontal, tryed few different thing but no success can you point me what i am doing wrong
[07:08:14] <BrazenBraden> Cork, not getting it :( I updated the gist a bit with the new .on() I'm trying to use and the part of the view that I am "talking" to in JS:  https://gist.github.com/brazenbraden/c08bb51612c3e68ee988
[07:08:51] <BrazenBraden> when clicking the button, a <div class="nested-fields"></div> is created is some form stuff'
[07:09:04] <BrazenBraden> thats why I put '.nested-fields' as the dynamic class thingy
[07:09:04] <Clint0n> hey all, anyone got an idea as to why .val() is not setting the value="" on my input field? The function is definitely working as the show() works fine, also alerted the value of ID (which is correct) HTML: http://pastebin.com/JZhZZJqT JS: http://pastebin.com/3ZmUEAe6
[07:09:39] <Cork> BrazenBraden: your still adding it on .find('a.add_fields')
[07:09:52] <Cork> and wasn't a.add_fields added later?
[07:10:20] <BrazenBraden> oh is that the problem.. no, the a.add_fields is there from the get-go.. its the button that must be clicked to load the other content
[07:10:43] <Cork> and the other content is inside the <a> element?
[07:10:57] <Cork> that sounds kinda scary
[07:11:33] <BrazenBraden> well no, the <a>, when clicked, loads a div of content above the <a>.
[07:11:44] <Cork> there you go
[07:11:47] <BrazenBraden> there is only one of the <a> per group
[07:11:55] <Cork> you can't bind the click on the a if the element isn't inside it
[07:12:09] <Cork> as the event won't bubble as it isn't a parent
[07:12:09] <jacquerie> Clint0n, I think you are targeting '.instagram-id' instead of '#instagram-id'
[07:12:25] <theschwag> @Clint0n could you try $(".instagram_id").attr('value', id_str); and see what happens
[07:13:09] <jacquerie> Clint0n, oh, sorry, you already have that.
[07:13:26] <BrazenBraden> Cork, umm ok.. but the div is not the one being clicked but the button in the div (sorry, im confused :S)
[07:14:25] <Clint0n> cheers guys, theschwag I will give that a go now mate
[07:14:54] <BrazenBraden> Cork, ah something happened
[07:15:55] <BrazenBraden> I changed "$('#operationmod_manifest_cocoon_customer_customer_salary_types').find('a.add_fields').off().on('click', '.nested-fields', function(e){Say('boobies');}).trigger('click');"  to   "$('#operationmod_manifest_cocoon_customer_customer_salary_types').off().on('click', '.nested-fields', function(e){Say('boobies');}).find('a.add_fields').trigger('click');"
[07:16:03] <BrazenBraden> eugh thats nasty
[07:17:21] <Clint0n> theschwag: That worked, cheers matey :)
[07:18:13] <theschwag> Clint0n, awesome!
[07:22:22] <BrazenBraden> le sigh.. not I have race conditions
[07:34:09] <ashopin> Good morning all. I need help with a form submission. The form is used for a location search: enter your address, click Get Location to get the lat/long, click search to find results. I'd like to get rid of the Get Location and bind it to the search button. I did do a $('#form').submit() and added a function in there to click the Get Location link and I see that it fetches the lat/long, but it's not used in the seach
[07:34:43] <ashopin> I'm not sure how to make the form wait until the lat/long is returned to submit.
[07:36:54] <theschwag> ashopin, can you post a pastebin link or something similar so we can see the code?
[07:37:00] <ashopin> Yup, one sec
[07:38:35] <ashopin> Warning, lots of HTML markup due to Drupal. http://jsfiddle.net/110vdq1p/
[07:40:01] <mrnugget> I've got a problem with jquery-ui autocomplete and event.stopPropagation() -- I don't understand why it behaves the way it does. I created an example with instructions here: http://jsbin.com/bisiyekudu/1/ -- Any ideas?
[07:40:02] <ashopin> So "Get Location" is clicked, lat and long is retrieved, then the user clicks search. I'd like to bind the Get Location to the Search, which I have done but it's searching before the lat/long is retrieved.
[07:42:16] <theschwag> ashopin, maybe write a separate function to submit the form, and make the search button on click do the lat/long lookup and after it has done that then it runs the function that submits the form
[07:45:04] <ashopin> theschwag: the form is being generated by drupal so I don't have that much control over it.
[07:45:37] <theschwag> ashopin, ah...hmmm. I'll see if I can think of something else
[07:46:04] <ashopin> theschwag: thanks, I just have to intercept the form submit, which I can do with submit() but I need a condition to not submit until the lat/long have values
[07:54:18] <K4T> hello
[07:55:45] <K4T> I created login and register forms on one page. User can switch between those forms without ajax/reloading page. For this I used fade in/out functions. How I can make something like history of form switches? I want to add ability to use back button in browser to this. So when user go from login page to register page he should be allowed to use back button to go back to login form. How I can
[07:55:45] <K4T> achievie it?
[07:56:12] <K4T> page = form*
[07:56:35] <notchris> Anyone familiat with Facbook‚Äôs JS SDK?
[08:09:07] <oleole> I'm using UI sortable and clones the item to a new list when dropped. But it is always appended to the list, and not actually placed where you dropped it (where the placeholder is shown). Do you know how I can replace appendTo to instead place it on the actual drop location? My code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/2rvwf4rn/
[08:09:23] <oleole> I tried using the placeholder, but it gets removed before remove: is called
[08:31:38] <datazombie> hello I am doing a $.ajax post and its working but I am getting an Syntax Error: unexpected end of input any help would be appreciated
[08:31:55] <NoiseEee> datazombie: presumably that's coming from your backend
[08:32:12] <arthurvr> datazombie: double-check your syntax. It‚Äôs a syntax error.
[08:32:25] <arthurvr> datazombie: it would be helpful if you could paste your code?
[08:32:28] <datazombie> syntax error on the client code or the server
[08:32:30] <datazombie> I will
[08:32:31] <arthurvr> datazombie: it might be invalid json too
[08:32:43] <arthurvr> client. Your JS or your json
[08:34:03] <interestinall> i got disconnected. did you get an answer datazombie?
[08:34:30] <arthurvr> yes, I think so :)
[08:34:44] <datazombie> https://gist.github.com/jmejias/120e0cb71cb5fddeb730
[08:34:47] <interestinall> cool :)
[08:34:54] <datazombie> thats my code
[08:35:21] <arthurvr> datazombie: well first of all you should know you can‚Äôt use `let` in some browsers :)
[08:35:35] <datazombie> I have a 6to5 compiler
[08:35:40] <arthurvr> k
[08:36:00] <arthurvr> datazombie: it‚Äôs very likely the syntax error is in the json.
[08:36:07] <arthurvr> go double check that :)
[08:36:22] <datazombie> I posted the json object on the example
[08:36:44] <arthurvr> datazombie: where? I only see example.js
[08:37:05] <datazombie> line 1 on the JSON.stringify
[08:37:21] <datazombie> thats the object I am sending
[08:38:20] <arthurvr> datazombie: oh that way
[08:38:41] <arthurvr> datazombie: you sure you‚Äôre back end setup is working?
[08:38:55] <datazombie> yes I am getting 200 and 201 back from the call
[08:39:12] <arthurvr> datazombie: it might be your server responding something non-json too
[08:39:16] <arthurvr> Oh hi Caper√ß
[08:39:22] <arthurvr> ~Caper!
[08:39:33] <datazombie> server is just accepting the call theres no response back
[08:39:53] <arthurvr> datazombie: well no response is actually invalid json
[08:40:02] <arthurvr> datazombie: $.ajax tries to parse an empty string
[08:40:09] <arthurvr> datazombie: and therefor, it throws an error.
[08:40:29] <datazombie> is there a way to not do it that way
[08:40:49] <arthurvr> datazombie: make your server return valid json :)
[08:40:56] <datazombie> ok thanks
[08:40:56] <arthurvr> Could just be an empty object.
[08:41:47] <arthurvr> datazombie: that‚Äôs the native behaviour, fyi: http://gyazo.com/1f57eab83ddce1448b959e000766f2ba
[08:42:06] <datazombie> yep thats it
[08:49:29] <notchris> Why would a selector not respond to a click function
[08:49:35] <notchris> If I know the selector is referenced correctly
[08:50:19] <BillCriswell> notchris: Is the element available when you try to attach the event?
[08:50:42] <notchris> How do I check
[08:51:15] <BillCriswell> Check the length.
[08:51:34] <BillCriswell> $('a[data-url]').length
[08:52:20] <BillCriswell> Also, is that literally in the markup or are you doing like $('a').data('url', 'foo'); then trying to select it like that?
[08:59:58] <cusco> hey folks
[09:00:05] <arthurvr> hey cusco
[09:00:55] <cusco> can I say: var = document.getElementById('bla') and do several stuff with var, and then.. $(var + ' href:first-child').text('something')
[09:00:58] <cusco> ?
[09:01:20] <cusco> I would like to manipulate the first ocurrence of href in the var
[09:04:05] <randomguy> I have a generic function which builds datepickers in my app.  It looks on the elements to see if they have classes, to know how to configure the datepicker options.  For instance, "nofuture" could cause the options to include "maxDate = new Date();"  I want to test this function (with jasminejs 1.3) by spying on the datepicker method and getting the arguments passed into it, but so far I've had no luck.....
[09:04:32] <randomguy> I've tried spyOn($, 'datepicker') and spyOn(jQuery, 'datepicker') but so far have not been able to get the args used.  Is there a way to do this?
[09:05:57] <randomguy> Currently I'm able to get the options by putting the on the object with prop(), but I don't like that solution
[09:26:04] <RavinduL> Hi! I just used masonry on a ul with modifed li elements. The vertical spacing (margin-bottom) doesn't work at page load. When I resize the page however, the margin-bottoms come into effect. Does anyone know how I can fix this?
[09:26:40] <RavinduL> It doesn't work for margin-top either :/
[09:32:54] <bbclover> if you want to make a function that is an ajax return when on success it does something you specify (i.e. different cases of success for the same data sent), how would you do that?
[09:33:11] <bbclover> I mean I'm worried about the asynchronicity of the whole matter
[09:33:23] <bbclover> which is an ajax call**
[09:35:24] <NoiseEee> bbclover: i don't get it
[09:37:31] <bbclover> so I'll have like function a() { $.ajax({ url: something, data: something, success: function (response) { varies }); } how would I do this?
[09:37:50] <bbclover> I basically don't want to repeat all of this ajax code if the success is the only thing changing
[09:38:18] <bbclover> i'm trying to get some data from the server from this url, passing the same data, etc
[09:40:04] <randomguy> @bbclover If you want to repeat the call, but with a different success method, you could change your function to take in a successCallback and use that on the success: option
[09:40:51] <NoiseEee> bbclover: or have your response indicate what function should be called
[09:40:58] <NoiseEee> bbclover: or a particular parameter, etc
[09:42:04] <bbclover> please elaborate NoiseEee, my question is that I don't know how to do this haha
[09:42:36] <bbclover> my response is always gonna be the same. What I do with that response (in the success), is what will change
[09:43:07] <randomguy> @bbclover function a(successCallback) { $.ajax({ url: something, data: something, success: successCallback); } and invocation a(function (response) { varies })
[09:44:34] <bbclover> wow that's really amazing
[09:45:06] <randomguy> any object can be a parameter for the most part.  similar to closures in other languages
[09:46:03] <bbclover> yeah, this is my first exposure to a language that has this callback/closure thing

[09:52:36] <pilotbob> If there are multiple document ready event handlers, I assume they run in the order they were created? Or is that not 100% for sure?
[10:00:22] <Omar-> pilotbob why would you use more than one .ready()?
[10:00:42] <Omar-> hey robertmaxrees
[10:00:55] <Omar-> this is for you [18:52] <pilotbob> If there are multiple document ready event handlers, I assume they run in the order they were created? Or is that not 100% for sure?
[10:01:05] <robertmaxrees> hahahah
[10:01:10] <Omar-> :P
[10:01:18] <robertmaxrees> pretty much in the order they were created, but i would never rely on it.
[10:02:57] <Omar-> robertmaxrees reddit comes to you http://jsbin.com/retaji ;)
[10:09:32] <pilotbob> Omar-: to encapsulate funcationity in different script files.
[10:12:59] <kokut> Hello, i'm having a lil bit of trouble running a simple script in my footer, i have $(document).ready(function(){//bla}); and its throwing "undefined is not a function" in chrome, jquery is included at the top of the page.
[10:13:17] <robertmaxrees> try using jQuery instead of $
[10:14:04] <james2doyle> jQuery(document).ready(function($){//bla and $ == jQuery now});
[10:14:21] <robertmaxrees> ^ you can do this if you want.  you might have noConflict mode turned on.
[10:14:29] <kokut> its only happenning in  chrome
[10:14:40] <kokut> its working fine @firefox
[10:15:01] <kevireilly> kokut: can you confirm that the request for the jquery source is indeed being retrieved via the Network tab of the developer tools?
[10:15:34] <robertmaxrees> and make sure you only have one copy loading.
[10:15:57] <kokut> yea kevireilly they are being retrieved correctly
[10:16:34] <kokut> robertmaxrees: there is only one as far as i know, it works @firefox but not @chrome and its the most simple function ever (removes margin from body and html elements)
[10:16:36] <james2doyle> are you using defer or async on your script tags?
[10:16:47] <kokut> im not sure
[10:16:58] <kokut> in jquery
[10:17:04] <robertmaxrees> on the script tags.
[10:17:09] <kokut> nope
[10:17:19] <kevireilly> IE: <script src="jquery.js" async="true"></script>
[10:17:19] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a race condition.
[10:17:52] <robertmaxrees> try jQuery instead of $ - i'd be interested to see if that works.
[10:18:06] <james2doyle> kokut: you have your jQuery in your head but the inline script in the footer?
[10:18:55] <kokut> oh wow it worked with jQuery
[10:18:59] <kokut> thank you
[10:19:08] <james2doyle> so this works? jQuery(document).ready(function($){//bla and $ == jQuery now});
[10:19:17] <kokut> yea
[10:19:23] <kokut> better than $ in my case
[10:19:26] <robertmaxrees> sounds like multiple copies of JQ loaded then.
[10:19:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd triple-check to make sure that's not happening.
[10:20:25] <jfitzsim> or its WordPress and in no-conflict mode
[10:20:35] <robertmaxrees> he said that it works in other browsers.
[10:20:45] <jfitzsim> ah, I missed that
[10:21:30] <robertmaxrees> or it's a default wordpress setup with a second copy loading.

[10:49:01] <SmashingX2> I have a fixedhead datatable with the first 4 rows fixed to the top when scrolling down, the problem is that when I try to make the second row the one that says ‚Äúmake me colspan=3‚Äù make it colspan=3 the datatable loses its ability to be fixed to the top. I don‚Äôt know why that could affect the datatable. Please help. Code; http://jsfiddle.net/xF8hZ/139/
[10:52:11] <MarkyC> I need to process some text field preliminarily before submitting the form. Is this the preferred convention?: $('#form').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); /* ...some processing... */ $('#form').off('submit').submit() } );
[10:52:37] <randomguy> with jasminejs is there a way to spy on the $().datepicker() method?
[10:53:22] <randomguy> i've tried spyOn($, 'datepicker') and spyOn(jQuery, 'datepicker') with no luck
[10:56:31] <BillCriswell> MarkyC: What's with the $('#form').off('submit').submit(); part/
[10:56:43] <MarkyC> BillCriswell: I need to submit the form after the processing is done
[10:56:47] <duch_kazatel> he's trying to remove the handler and submit the form.
[10:56:53] <MarkyC> duch_kazatel: bingo
[10:57:27] <BillCriswell> MarkyC: Why not just only e.preventDefault() when you encounter an error?
[10:58:47] <MarkyC> BillCriswell: makes sense. Looks like I made it needlessly difficuly :P
[10:59:16] <BillCriswell> Haha, happens.
[11:01:37] <jcrawford> i am told this is more of a jQuery question than Backbone but can anyone assist here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28839270/collection-delegating-events
[11:01:57] <jcrawford> the event bindings on the ListRow views are being lost when i filter the collection
[11:04:07] <BillCriswell> Not super familiar with bacbone but I imagine you're applying the only when the elements are initially loaded?
[11:04:20] <BillCriswell> you're applying the events only*
[11:04:37] <richie> how can I input this (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22882949/nan-custom-error-message-in-javascript) into my current formula http://jsfiddle.net/0csh9vqs/1/
[11:04:39] <misz> What is the best way to wait for ajax completion when the requests are dependant on eachother(Topic contains user_id and callback of topic fetches more information about the user)?
[11:05:04] <khmer> misz: promises are increasingly standard for that
[11:05:14] <BillCriswell> misz: .then()
[11:05:25] <duch_kazatel> richie pair down your example/.
[11:05:28] <khmer> oh wait i'm in #jquery
[11:05:41] <richie> what?
[11:06:04] <misz> BillCriswell: Wont work when you have multiple objects in the JSON reply and are iterating over them
[11:06:06] <duch_kazatel> we usually ask for self-contained example that illustrate the problem.  that looks like an entire calculator widgets
[11:06:08] <duch_kazatel> *widget
[11:06:13] <misz> khmer: Thank you, will take a look at it
[11:06:34] <BillCriswell> misz: Uhh.. ok
[11:06:37] <richie> oh I meant when the output displays NaN I would rather it display a custom message
[11:06:46] <richie> like "Input Error"
[11:07:11] <duch_kazatel> lol
[11:07:20] <duch_kazatel> misz you got suggested the same thing by two people fwiw.
[11:07:20] <richie> I know probably super easy, Im learning :(
[11:10:48] <simion314_> I am using jquery ui dialog and I want to open the dialog at an absolute position(I want to restore the position that I saved from previous sessions) but I can't find a way to do it
[11:11:08] <richie> Oops, I forgot to load jquery in jsfiddle, my mistake
[11:11:50] <kevireilly> simion314_: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-position
[11:13:07] <simion314_> kevireilly: that is some relative position, I do noot find a way to use that to get what I need
[11:13:23] <duch_kazatel> richie let me fix some stuff up here.
[11:14:15] <misz> Can one promise multiple objects using the same defered object?
[11:14:54] <kevireilly> simion314_: kind of sucks, but I suppose one option is just doing it manually... $('#dialog-instance').css({ top: '20px', left: '20px' });
[11:15:43] <simion314_> kevireilly: that does not work, it will brake the dialog
[11:16:24] <duch_kazatel> richie so this is at least a little cleaner: http://jsfiddle.net/0csh9vqs/3/
[11:16:37] <kevireilly> simion314_: I'd have to see it I suppose, but curious how it breaks?
[11:16:57] <duch_kazatel> richie so what you want to do is check your values before those .text() calls.
[11:17:17] <richie> interesting
[11:17:42] <duch_kazatel> or use conditionals when setting the vars in the first place.  either/or
[11:18:04] <richie> okay I'm following
[11:18:07] <randomguy> quick and dirty change: http://jsfiddle.net/0csh9vqs/4/
[11:18:11] <randomguy> @richie
[11:18:38] <duch_kazatel> still some bad code in there fwiw.
[11:18:53] <richie> oh wow, ty sir @randomguy but yeah how would I clean that up?
[11:19:06] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0csh9vqs/5/
[11:19:10] <duch_kazatel> this is what you really want.
[11:19:27] <richie> OMG I DIDNT KNOW YOU COULD DO THAT
[11:19:35] <richie> thank you guys
[11:19:40] <duch_kazatel> NaN is falsy.
[11:19:45] <richie> dang
[11:20:34] <richie> I can even input text in it
[11:20:37] <richie> that's so cool!
[11:20:44] <duch_kazatel> right.
[11:20:56] <richie> thank you
[11:21:02] <duch_kazatel> also i cleaned your code up to properly declare some vars and stuff.
[11:21:41] <richie> thank you
[11:21:43] <richie> :)
[11:21:55] <simion314_> kevireilly: I checked again, the issue with using .css was that I had to find the actual dialog top element, so I had to add a .parent()
[11:22:15] <Anish1> I would like to contribute ! can someone get me started ?
[11:22:24] <kevireilly> simion314_: ah gotcha, so that approach might actually work then?
[11:22:26] <MLM> Do `opts.username` and `opts.password` on $.ajax still work for basic auth? I can't get them to work and looking in the unminified jQuery source, they seem to be commented out
[11:24:28] <duch_kazatel> Anish1 to what?
[11:24:31] <duch_kazatel> jquery?
[11:24:31] <simion314_> kevireilly: yes, I think it will work, I am writing the code now, tested it in console and it worked
[11:25:23] <Anish1> yes duch_kazatel I dunno how to start contributing
[11:25:29] <duch_kazatel> Anish1 check out http://contribute.jquery.org/
[11:25:38] <duch_kazatel> also head over to #jquery-dev for any dev related chat :)
[11:27:13] <Anish1> Thanks duch_kazatel
[11:27:20] <kevireilly> simion314_: sweet!
[11:28:19] <kevireilly> MLM: the docs seem to believe it is still around -- what version are you using?
[11:28:23] <simion314_> kevireilly: thx, it seems to work, now my dialog is saving it's position and size
[11:28:28] <Anish1> duch_kazatel https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/96 i like to work on this !
[11:28:42] <kevireilly> simion314_: delicious, happy to help and glad you got something figured out that works
[11:28:55] <MLM> kevireilly: jQuery 1.11.2
[11:29:59] <kevireilly> MLM: ah. The docs say it was added in 1.0 but I suspect that upgrading should make it all better. Guessing you cant though?
[11:30:38] <MLM> kevireilly? That is the latest version of jQuery?
[11:30:58] <MLM> http://jquery.com/download/
[11:31:10] <kevireilly> MLM: oh totally misread that as 1.1.2 ;)
[11:31:17] <duch_kazatel> Anish1 great - read http://contribute.jquery.org/, sign the CLA, and go to #jquery-dev if you have any more questions.
[11:31:58] <kevireilly> MLM: what line are you seeing it commented out on?
[11:32:12] <MLM> kevireilly: 8875
[11:32:51] <MLM> Trying to find the built version on GitHub to link but I can only find separated source modules
[11:33:13] <kevireilly> MLM: you're sure it isn't 9620? I'm not familiar with the specifics here but seeing that commented out there may not be enough of an indication
[11:33:26] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/1.11.2/dist
[11:33:51] <kevireilly> MLM: for example, I'm guessing timeout, data, dataType, cache, headers are all pretty important ones
[11:36:27] <kevireilly> I'd personally verify that the username/password is correct via browser or otherwise
[11:37:55] <MLM> kevireilly: I realize that and only used it as a indication to ask here if the docs are still correct. I'll look into it more because it seems to still be in service from what I have heard here.
[11:39:33] <MLM> If I visit `http://mlm:asdf1234@localhost:8080/api/queues` it gives a response. If I try the same thing (even trying two ways it still gives a 401 unauthorized :/ $.ajax({ url: 'http://mlm:asdf1234@localhost:8080/api/queues', username: 'mlm', password: 'asdf1234' })`
[11:40:28] <duch_kazatel> are you in control of that server?
[11:40:34] <MLM> Yes
[11:43:15] <MLM> It is cross domain but I am not getting and CORS errors and I have the API server to accept from anywhere. `localhost/` vs `localhost:8080/`
[11:43:59] <kevireilly> MLM: same thing without the username/password pre-baked into the `url` yeah?
[11:44:16] <MLM> kevireilly: Correct
[11:44:42] <richie> How come input error doesnt work on both variables, but just fine on the last one alone? https://jsfiddle.net/0csh9vqs/20/
[11:44:47] <MLM> And same response without pre-baked url or username/password fields
[11:45:04] <MLM> (same 401 unauthorized response)
[11:45:33] <jshriver> greetings anyone here familiar with datatables?
[11:45:55] <jshriver> trying to figure out how the sDom attribute works for specifying where different elements go.
[11:46:14] <jshriver> I tried several examples but I can't get search/show in the same row
[11:46:52] <kevireilly> MLM: seems like another option might be a header { "Authorization": "Basic " + botoa("username:password") }
[11:47:00] <jshriver> btw I am new to CSS and Javascript in general
[11:47:01] <kevireilly> *btoa
[11:47:58] <duch_kazatel> richie start by opening your console.
[11:48:00] <duch_kazatel> you have an error.
[11:48:41] <MLM> kevireilly: Thanks, I was looking into that and was looking for a base64 encoding (`btoa`). It works now :) - Still wondering about those other options though
[11:49:01] <richie> Yeah I read it and it said undefined is not a function
[11:49:11] <richie> hmmm
[11:49:12] <duch_kazatel> right
[11:49:13] <kevireilly> MLM: server side you might need to provide additional headers for the CORS request -- Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization // Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
[11:49:25] <duch_kazatel> because you're trying to use .toFixed() against strings, which doesn't work, richie
[11:49:50] <mwdev1> Do you guys usually still use tables on your responsive websites? with how big all the plugins are its almost just better to build it with html css I feel. (coming from someone who has never used a table)
[11:49:50] <richie> Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[11:50:21] <duch_kazatel> mwdev1 i don't understand that tables have to do with responsive websites.
[11:50:23] <kevireilly> MLM: also maybe try a specific origin instead of *
[11:50:37] <richie> i see i may as well just leave it 0 then
[11:50:45] <duch_kazatel> richie errr.
[11:50:59] <duch_kazatel> just do the .toFixed() calls on the resuls of the parseFloat() calls.
[11:51:20] <duch_kazatel> parseFloat(revPerMonth * 12).toFixed(2) || "Input Error", etc
[11:51:33] <MLM> kevireilly: hmmm, I am using this pacakge to handle the headers but I'll look into what exact headers it adds: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors
[11:51:49] <richie> seriously
[11:51:52] <richie> its that easy
[11:51:57] <mwdev1> yeah it doesnt really lol, was just to provide alittle more info if needed. The main negative thing i read on tables is they dont work well with responsive
[11:51:59] <richie> omg where have you been all my life
[11:52:08] <duch_kazatel> you're just making shit too hard.
[11:52:11] <richie> lol
[11:53:13] <kevireilly> MLM: they do seem to be configuration options for that module... also might want to try enabling CORS pre-flight from those docs
[11:53:33] <kevireilly> MLM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors#enabling-cors-pre-flight and https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors#configuration-options
[11:53:37] <MLM> kk, was just reading thoght taht seciton: https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors#enabling-cors-pre-flight
[11:53:50] <MLM> *through that section
[11:54:09] <mwdev1> would you say using tables is still valid today? and if so would you suggest using a jquery plugin? or just making boxes with html/css
[11:54:21] <kevireilly> MLM: excellent. Please let me know what you find, I am curious indeed and might come across this exact scenario in the future ;)
[11:54:36] <duch_kazatel> mwdev1 only use tables if you have tabular data.
[11:54:42] <duch_kazatel> don't use them for layout.
[11:54:51] <MLM> kevireilly: will do :)
[11:56:15] <jshriver> Does anyone know how to change the physical position of the DataTables Dom elements besides ordering.
[11:56:35] <duch_kazatel> jshriver you'll probably have more luck on their forums.
[11:56:39] <jshriver> sDom only changes top or bottom but I can't get it to have multiple in one line
[11:56:51] <jshriver> hrm ok ty
[11:56:53] <richie> http://jsfiddle.net/0csh9vqs/28/ Hmmm I followed the instructions, is it because its .text ?
[11:57:26] <duch_kazatel> richie ... the addcommas function...
[11:57:57] <richie> oh
[11:58:23] <mwdev1> duch_kazatel, thanks yeah i am really on the edge of using one. Is there a jquery table you find best? Would you recommend custom making your own? I have looked up a few and am having trouble deciding.
[11:58:32] <duch_kazatel> mwdev1 "jquery table"?
[11:58:54] <SmashingX2> I have a fixedhead datatable with the first 4 rows fixed to the top when scrolling down, the problem is that when I try to make the second row the one that says ‚Äúmake me colspan=3‚Äù make it colspan=3 the datatable loses its ability to be fixed to the top. I don‚Äôt know why that could affect the datatable. Please help. Code; http://jsfiddle.net/xF8hZ/139/
[11:58:56] <richie> revPerMonth = parseFloat(addCommas(dailyBillingTotal * 21)).toFixed(2) would that work?
[11:59:12] <duch_kazatel> richie other way around.
[11:59:24] <richie> oh
[11:59:30] <richie> addcommas then parsefloat
[11:59:31] <duch_kazatel> addCommas around everything else.
[11:59:34] <duch_kazatel> right.
[11:59:40] <richie> okay cool ty
[12:00:06] <duch_kazatel> all about return values.
[12:01:46] <duch_kazatel> SmashingX2 i'm lost.
[12:02:02] <duch_kazatel> how do I break it?
[12:02:11] <SmashingX2> duch_kazatel: try to make the 2row colspan=3
[12:02:23] <SmashingX2> and it will loss its ability to be locked to the top
[12:02:24] <duch_kazatel> "the 2row"?
[12:02:36] <SmashingX2> it says make me colspan=3
[12:02:40] <SmashingX2> that one
[12:02:49] <duch_kazatel> i see three separate elements there.
[12:03:11] <duch_kazatel> should there be one with colspan=3
[12:03:12] <duch_kazatel> ?
[12:03:53] <duch_kazatel> like this? http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xF8hZ/140/
[12:04:38] <m0dmd> good day everyone.
[12:05:00] <SmashingX2> yep duch_kazatel, now fixedhead is broken
[12:05:06] <duch_kazatel> open your console.
[12:05:35] <SmashingX2> nothing there
[12:05:45] <duch_kazatel> reload the page with it open.
[12:06:28] <richie> https://jsfiddle.net/0csh9vqs/31/ undefined is not a function, I thought I did it right, hmmm
[12:06:52] <duch_kazatel> richie addCommas returns a string.
[12:06:59] <duch_kazatel> .toFixed() only works on numbers...
[12:07:32] <richie> oh
[12:07:34] <SmashingX2> duch_kazatel: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'style' of undefined
[12:07:51] <duch_kazatel> SmashingX2 right, so basically datables is throwing an error for some reason.
[12:08:20] <SmashingX2> that‚Äôs what I want to know
[12:09:01] <duch_kazatel> *shrug* datatables doesn't like the colspan it looks liel.

[12:12:02] <MLM> *no different response
[12:26:07] <kevireilly> MLM: ah gotcha
[12:26:25] <MLM> kevireilly: This could be related to the problem: http://stackoverflow.com/a/13584559/796832
[12:28:08] <GFXDude> The jQueryUI API says dialog's resizable option is a Resizable widget. I would like to customize some properties of this resizable widget, including the handles and grid. I'm not sure of the appropriate syntax though. The API simply shows $( ".selector" ).dialog( "option", "resizable", false );    There's not much about the appropriate way to customize the resizable widget
[12:28:42] <kevireilly> MLM: interesting. Guess that explains why the Authorization header approach worked
[12:28:48] <GFXDude> I found a post on google groups with this syntax: $("#myDiv").dialog({ resizable: 'se' });    which works to specify the actual handles
[12:29:00] <GFXDude> But I cannot specify a class for the handles with that syntax
[12:29:13] <MLM> kevreilly: Even when using `url: 'http://mlm:asdf1234@localhost:8080/api/queues',`, if you look at the network request going out: Request URL:http://localhost:8080/api/queues with not auth header
[12:29:52] <kevireilly> MLM: I think, but am not sure, that http://user:pass is a browser convention so maybe it does something differently when used in the URL area
[12:30:33] <MLM> kevireilly: true and maybe a necessary feature request to be made
[12:30:44] <MLM> (useful)
[12:40:01] <MLM> kevireilly: I made an issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2116 - If you see a way to clarify or describe the problem better, I'm interested
[12:40:17] <Nhiuig> hello
[12:40:58] <Nhiuig> someone here has worked with RGraph library for dynamic graphs?
[12:41:07] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ Nhiuig
[12:41:08] <b-ot> Nhiuig: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:41:38] <kevireilly> MLM: sounds goods, though you may want to mention the attempts with the OPTIONS and response header stuff as well
[12:42:10] <Nhiuig> http://jsfiddle.net/oxdL1oro/
[12:42:13] <Nhiuig> I have this
[12:42:16] <MLM> You mean with the CORS package?
[12:42:22] <Nhiuig> I need to separate the bars
[12:42:26] <Nhiuig> horizonatlly
[12:42:32] <Nhiuig> horizontally*
[12:42:40] <Nhiuig> now are vertically
[12:42:52] <duch_kazatel> Nhiuig giving us a working example would be helpful.
[12:43:09] <MLM> kevireilly: Do you mean playing with the CORS pacakage options  such as pre-flight or ...?
[12:43:35] <Nhiuig> screenplash ?
[12:44:14] <duch_kazatel> Nhiuig no - update the fiddle so it's functional, though looking at this i'm wondering if jquery is even involved here.
[12:44:27] <kevireilly> MLM: yah
[12:44:30] <Nhiuig> ok
[12:45:50] <duch_kazatel> Nhiuig you might have more luck in ##javascript and by perusing the rgraph docs and support resources
[12:57:30] <GFXDude> Revising my original question... I've found this syntax on SO:  $('#myDialog').dialog({ // options... }).dialog('widget').resizable({ //options... });
[12:57:59] <GFXDude> I've attempted to implement this, but it seems that the 'resizable: true' or 'resizable: false' option of the dialog overrides the resizable options
[12:59:28] <duch_kazatel> aren't dialogs also resizable widgets?
[13:03:37] <GFXDude> duch_kazatel, per the API: If set to true, the dialog will be resizable. Requires the jQuery UI Resizable widget to be included.
[13:04:09] <GFXDude> So yes, but it doesn't natively accept handle arguments, nor other arguments native to a
[13:04:13] <GFXDude> to a Resizable widget*
[13:04:20] <duch_kazatel> could you make a fiddle of what you're doing?
[13:04:29] <GFXDude> yeah, sec
[13:08:47] <Hey_neken> Hi, I've a project with jquery-1.7.1 and some JSONP requests. The small code involved is shown in http://jsfiddle.net/t8747cLo/1/ . We use this on www.example.com without problems but when we try to use it from test.example.com does not work, I see 'jQueryxxx_yyy was not called' on the debuger with parseerror. The request has a code 200. Any idea why using the same code from a subdomain can cause the
[13:08:47] <Hey_neken> error?
[13:09:26] <duch_kazatel> Hey_neken that's not the right wayt o specify callbacks.
[13:10:53] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t8747cLo/3/ give this a shot.
[13:12:46] <GFXDude> meh can't get the dialog to show on fiddle...
[13:12:56] <duch_kazatel> GFXDude show me what you've got so far.
[13:14:26] <GFXDude> https://jsfiddle.net/enqrdwvg/1/
[13:16:26] <duch_kazatel> check out your console.
[13:16:57] <Hey_neken> duch_kazatel, the main difference is that you remove context, crossDomain, type and timeout and make done a function instead of a simple alert, but still doesn't work
[13:17:20] <duch_kazatel> Hey_neken the way you specified the alert meant that it'll always run fwiw.
[13:17:26] <duch_kazatel> what's in your done callback function?
[13:18:24] <Hey_neken> duch_kazatel, call to functions .done(this._done).fail(this._fail).always(this._always);
[13:19:14] <duch_kazatel> Hey_neken let me clarify - i'm wondering if you're trying to do something like parse JSON.parse() on not a string or something along those lines.
[13:20:33] <MarkyC> Say I have an <option value="&deg; C">Celsius</option>. How can I use $select.val() to set the select to that value?
[13:20:39] <Hey_neken> duch_kazatel, if done I innerHTML-replace the text, if fail a fail box appears, but I always get fail with 'jqueryxxx_yyy was not called' if using from a subdomain
[13:21:06] <duch_kazatel> Hey_neken dunno then - things worked from the JSfidddle I shared, so i have no way of knowing without seeing more.
[13:21:16] <MarkyC> $select.val("&deg; C"); doesn't work, likely because &deg; was already converted to the degrees symbol by the browser
[13:21:19] <duch_kazatel> MarkyC $('select').val() should get that.
[13:21:30] <duch_kazatel> oh that's what you mean.
[13:21:39] <duch_kazatel> paste up an example, MarkyC?
[13:21:45] <duch_kazatel> in a fiddle i mean.
[13:22:20] <Hey_neken> duch_kazatel, thanks for your time! the code seems to work but the strange thing is that it depends if we call it from www.example.com or sub.example.com, on which fails, very strange
[13:22:41] <duch_kazatel> Hey_neken so it works from jsfiddle but not from within your site?
[13:22:45] <duch_kazatel> sounds like something else is up.
[13:23:08] <Hey_neken> duch_kazatel, yep, but didn't found still
[13:23:26] <duch_kazatel> you're not, like, loading jquery multiple times or anythign like that, right?
[13:24:53] <MarkyC> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/g1tgk0xd/
[13:25:30] <MarkyC> duch_kazatel: Using val here makes the select display empty content because it can't find the option with that value. Should I use a literal degrees symbol here?
[13:25:51] <GFXDude> duch_kazatel, it refuses to work. Console has strange error 'Using //@ to indicate sourceURL pragmas is deprecated. Use //# instead'
[13:26:46] <GFXDude> manually included jquery/1.11.1  jqueryui/1.11.1  and jquerui/css/1.11.1
[13:27:13] <MarkyC> duch_kazatel: putting a literal degrees symbol works: ¬∞
[13:27:36] <GFXDude> As builtin wasn't working, but still nothing. Getting the dialog to show in my environment isn't the issue though. The dialog works fine, it's just the resizable options that I need to get working
[13:31:44] <GFXDude> http://jsfiddle.net/enqrdwvg/9/
[13:31:59] <Hey_neken> duch_kazatel, no... and now I found something more strange... so the problem is somewhere else but the error I get is the not calling callback for jsonp
[13:38:02] <Cork> Hey_neken: .fail/error doesn't work for jsonp
[13:38:18] <Cork> as it can't be cross browser implemented for <script> tags
[13:38:52] <Cork> (jquery 2.x adds this support as it drops support for ie versions that doesn't provide the event)
[13:39:33] <Cork> done/success should work just fine though
[13:40:52] <Hey_neken> Cork, I'll try with that, thanks
[13:44:35] <AdNauseaum> is there a way to make the custom scroll bar feel smoother? everything feels kinda slow/laggy when you scroll with this scroll bar http://elpasoconcretecontractor.com/vemac/
[13:46:46] <GFXDude> Per this post in the jquery forum, I can use $('#myDialog').dialog('widget').resizable({ .. }): https://forum.jquery.com/topic/specify-drag-and-resize-option-for-dialogs
[13:46:57] <GFXDude> Which I've attempted to do here: http://jsfiddle.net/enqrdwvg/15/
[13:47:08] <GFXDude> Dialog works as expected, except all handles are available
[13:47:25] <GFXDude> which I believe is due to 'resizable: true' in the dialog parameters
[14:03:11] <Hey_neken> Cork, I removed done/fail and replaced them with success/error and still the same problem http://jsfiddle.net/etsnaojf/ callback is not being called
[14:03:36] <Cork> Hey_neken: you missed the point
[14:03:45] <Cork> it isn't done vs success
[14:03:55] <Cork> it is that fail/error doesn't work with jsonp
[14:04:04] <Cork> at all
[14:04:25] <Cork> success or done should both work just fine
[14:05:11] <Hey_neken> Cork, I see your point, but the code doesn't follow that path
[14:05:31] <Cork> Hey_neken: the code you showed before used .fail
[14:05:48] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/etsnaojf/3/ Hey_neken you've got other problems then.
[14:05:49] <Cork> my point is you can't catch failed jsonp calls
[14:05:54] <duch_kazatel> we can't replicate this on our end.
[14:08:30] <Axane> Hello guys
[14:08:55] <Hey_neken> duch_kazatel, user/pass is needed
[14:09:05] <Axane> How can i call each variable in for loop if i have 4 different vars in js file like picture1 picture2 picture3?
[14:09:06] <duch_kazatel> Hey_neken then i'm not sure what you expect us to do.
[14:09:16] <duch_kazatel> Axane make a fiddle.
[14:11:06] <Hey_neken> duch_kazatel, you helped me a lot
[14:12:05] <Cork> Axane: normally the best way is to put those values as properties on an object in stead
[14:12:13] <Axane> dutch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/r5b6crah/ how can i access all four slike in for loop
[14:12:26] <duch_kazatel> woah wtf.
[14:12:50] <Axane> duch_kazatel silka are defined at the end of javascript at jsfiddle :)
[14:13:03] <duch_kazatel> wrong way to use jsfiddle.
[14:13:10] <duch_kazatel> make a self-contained, short example.
[14:13:45] <Cork> Axane: make slika into a two dimensional array
[14:13:57] <Cork> var slika = [ [], [], [] ]
[14:13:57] <duch_kazatel> i don't even understand what you're trying to do here.
[14:14:18] <Cork> duch_kazatel: i think he is trying to put an image or something like that as data in js
[14:14:25] <Cork> like vectors or something like that
[14:14:42] <Axane> Cork i can't change these silka arrays.
[14:14:42] <duch_kazatel> okay - why use for loops at all?
[14:15:03] <Cork> Axane: then you can't really loop them
[14:15:09] <richie> that was weird....
[14:15:15] <randomguy-laptop> is that a bellpepper?
[14:15:16] <richie> what is that axane
[14:16:09] <duch_kazatel> Axane your first issue is that for loops don't have scope, so doing var foo; inside a loop is a bad idea.
[14:16:30] <duch_kazatel> your second issue is it looks like you're convoluting something - what's the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[14:17:11] <Cork> duch_kazatel: that isn't actually a big problem, the var just gets hoisted outside the for loop
[14:17:22] <Cork> as long as nothing is async that is
[14:17:31] <Axane> duch_kazatel this one is working okay but if i want to display all 4 pictures (these 4 arrays) i will always have to change name of the array so 4 same loops.
[14:17:46] <duch_kazatel> i'm aware of what happens, but it often leads to bugs when you do things like create new jquery objects ;)
[14:17:52] <Cork> true
[14:18:03] <duch_kazatel> Axane then call it on the 4 different objects separately.
[14:18:18] <duch_kazatel> write a function and call it a day.
[14:18:34] <Cork> Axane: is the skia variables globals?
[14:18:45] <Cork> or are they in another scope?
[14:19:04] <Axane> Cork they are in another js file only this 4 slika1,2,3,4
[14:19:07] <duch_kazatel> you can hack against window.skia[i], but that's gross and will create a different set of problems.
[14:19:25] <Cork> Axane: doesn't really matter, are they defined inside a (function() {}() for example
[14:19:34] <Cork> or are they directly inside the js file
[14:19:38] <Axane> Cork nope.
[14:19:47] <Cork> then you can actually loop them
[14:19:59] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't do that.
[14:20:08] <duch_kazatel> now you're creating a weird contract.
[14:20:13] <Cork> window['skia' + i]
[14:20:58] <duch_kazatel> that's worse than just writing a function and calling it 4 times separately.
[14:21:03] <duch_kazatel> imo
[14:21:44] <Cork> except the function would have to use a lot of if cases or a switch case to do it
[14:21:50] <Cork> so ya, i think window is cleaner
[14:21:57] <duch_kazatel> i still disagree.
[14:22:03] <Cork> i would prefer to not do it on the window object
[14:22:12] <duch_kazatel> you're creating a weirdo implicit contract that those vars will always exist.
[14:22:20] <_DB> this is probably a long shot but
[14:22:22] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/yktz1pxw/
[14:22:30] <Cork> duch_kazatel: so does the function though
[14:22:31] <_DB> I have a plugin that creates a line graph for me
[14:22:45] <duch_kazatel> Cork sure, but at least in the future whoever looks at it next will know wtf is going on.
[14:22:46] <_DB> how can I access this data so i can change it?
[14:22:58] <duch_kazatel> instead of seeing some strange for loop that iterating over global vars.
[14:23:03] <_DB> its created externally am I supposed to create in internally ?
[14:23:16] <Cork> duch_kazatel: accessing a property on an object isn't anything strange
[14:23:30] <duch_kazatel> accessing global vars as properties on the window object is though.
[14:23:48] <Cork> not really, its how you define them in strict mode
[14:23:50] <duch_kazatel> it's all code smell it what i'm saying.
[14:23:54] <duch_kazatel> *is
[14:24:57] <Cork> sure i agree having them as global variables causes a lot of weird code requirements
[14:25:07] <Cork> but as he said he can't change that...
[14:25:19] <duch_kazatel> i still say it's a bad idea.
[14:25:21] <duch_kazatel> but whatevs.
[14:25:41] <Axane> Cork one more question, how am i able to rotate picture for 90 deg and i can't change array values...?
[14:25:51] <duch_kazatel> lol peace out folks.
[14:26:06] <_DB> anyone?
[14:26:45] <Cork> Axane: uh, 1. depends on how you show the image and 2. sure you can
[14:28:20] <Axane> Cork same fiddle as i sended
[14:32:17] <Cork> Axane: ah you meant the elements you create
[14:32:27] <Cork> Axane: didn't think of that as an "image"
[14:32:47] <Axane> Cork yeah element :)
[14:32:52] <Cork> Axane: the only option there would be to either to the math to position them correctly
[14:32:56] <Cork> or to use css3 transfrom
[14:33:00] <Cork> *transform
[14:37:21] <randomguy-laptop> playing around with it.  missed alot of the responses to it, but whatever http://jsfiddle.net/r5b6crah/1/
[14:43:26] <randomguy-laptop> rotated http://jsfiddle.net/r5b6crah/2/
[14:46:31] <jcrawford> anyone know why my backbone events would not fire until the second click?  I am not using toggle and cannot figure out why click event would be ignored on the first click
[14:52:19] <jcrawford> it appears that my first click is triggering my search method again which is very odd since the click is only bound to the one action and not bound to search action at all
[14:58:34] <wa5ted_> you guys is there anyway
[14:58:46] <wa5ted_> to use jquery to change the attribute value of a remote svg file
[15:26:23] <stylica> hi
[15:26:26] <stylica> For a link or button, is there a better event than 'click'? Something more specific like 'selected'?
[15:26:38] <robertmaxrees> "selected" isn't an event.
[15:26:40] <robertmaxrees> "click" is.
[15:27:30] <stylica> hm, but when I select a link with the arrow keys and then hit enter?
[15:27:37] <stylica> is this considered a 'click'?
[15:27:44] <stylica> I find this is not meta enough.
[15:28:02] <robertmaxrees> is that what you're trying to account for?
[15:28:17] <robertmaxrees> technically that's a keypress.
[15:29:29] <robertmaxrees> but http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8tu3x8tm/ works
[15:30:40] <stylica> damn, you are right.
[15:30:50] <stylica> selecting the link with the arrow keys / hitting enter won't fire the click event
[15:30:57] <stylica> what event can I use for anything that selects a link?
[15:30:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:31:03] <robertmaxrees> that works for me.
[15:31:14] <robertmaxrees> you don't use arrow keys to select links.
[15:31:36] <stylica> I mean tab.
[15:31:42] <robertmaxrees> that works for me.
[15:31:45] <stylica> ?
[15:31:58] <stylica> I use chrome, win7, but I don't see it logged then.
[15:32:00] <robertmaxrees> using tab and hitting enter for that link works.
[15:32:01] <stylica> aha
[15:32:03] <stylica> I got it
[15:32:05] <stylica> enter
[15:32:09] <stylica> space key won't fire it
[15:32:22] <stylica> ok, thanks
[15:32:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, space scrolls the page down.
[15:33:36] <stylica> robertmaxrees: another thing, if I may ask: .on('submit' doesn't seem to work, is this correct?
[15:33:45] <robertmaxrees> for links?
[15:34:05] <stylica> no for a form
[15:34:13] <robertmaxrees> that should work just fine.
[15:34:13] <stylica> aha, I guess I can't use the on submit on the button but on the whole form
[15:34:18] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:36:46] <stylica> ok!
[15:36:54] <stylica> Can I use 'not' instead '!' in javascript?
[15:37:01] <stylica> I come from ruby so I may be confused here.
[15:37:02] <robertmaxrees> no
[15:38:19] <stylica> ok!
[15:38:21] <stylica> thanks
[15:48:00] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: typical event when using a range input
[15:48:04] <wa5ted> is on change
[15:48:13] <wa5ted> im wondering if there is a more accurate event
[15:48:35] <wa5ted> like as long as im dragging my mouse when i select the range it will update the val that outputs to the console
[15:48:46] <stylica> ah yes
[15:49:01] <stylica> wa5ted: mouse released?
[15:49:18] <robertmaxrees> there's mousedown and mouseup./
[15:49:23] <wa5ted> well i want it so that as i drag my mouse (so mouse move i guess ) it updates the range value
[15:49:52] <robertmaxrees> set a bool on mousedown and check that on mousemove.
[15:50:02] <robertmaxrees> are you using a ranged slider input dealio?
[15:50:02] <wa5ted> right
[15:50:06] <wa5ted> yup
[15:50:10] <robertmaxrees> http://refreshless.com/nouislider/
[15:50:13] <robertmaxrees> see how these guys did it.
[15:52:50] <wa5ted> .on has a bunch of event arguments
[15:52:55] <wa5ted> where can i find the full list
[15:53:56] <robertmaxrees> it's under the attach function.
[15:54:09] <robertmaxrees> i haven't looked myself, but i really like this ranged slider.
[15:55:46] <wa5ted> lol
[15:56:05] <robertmaxrees> and it's pretty reliable, so i'm guessing the way they handle it is pretty solid.
[15:56:07] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: is it possible for one ot create a modifed range input by which i can skip some ranges
[15:56:18] <wa5ted> like example
[15:56:22] <wa5ted> 0, 1-5
[15:56:30] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted sure - nouislider does that lol
[17:13:11] <BillCriswell> Whoa. arthurvr updated the topic in here.
[17:13:16] <BillCriswell> Wasn't the last time like '06?
[17:13:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  he added the CoC
[17:15:45] <BillCriswell> Oh, so we have to act like adults now.
[17:16:01] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[17:16:06] <BillCriswell> Well, I still plan on making fun of you!
[17:16:18] <robertmaxrees> just gives us a place to point when we tell people to not, like, be mean or w/e
[17:16:42] <BillCriswell> totally understood.
[17:17:45] <robertmaxrees> you sure?
[17:17:52] <robertmaxrees> p sure you're giving me chaff rn
[17:18:40] <BillCriswell> I don't understand what chaff rn is
[17:18:50] <BillCriswell> but who knows maybe I mightbe.
[17:18:50] <robertmaxrees> rn = "right now"
[17:18:53] <BillCriswell> OH
[17:18:58] <robertmaxrees> "chaff" is like "shit" i guess?
[17:19:04] <robertmaxrees> i'm inventing words youngsters might say
[17:19:17] <BillCriswell> smh, ctfu
[17:19:23] <BillCriswell> omg
[17:19:31] <robertmaxrees> lel
[17:19:31] <robertmaxrees> hue
[17:19:45] <BillCriswell> Oh I like "hue"
[17:35:01] <rbo> Evening guys. ;)
[17:35:28] <coldhead> and girls
[17:35:31] <coldhead> and other
[17:35:35] <robertmaxrees> whuddup folks
[17:39:04] <BillCriswell> coldhead: Do you feel like the term "guys" can encompass women as well?
[17:41:56] <BillCriswell> I've used the term "guys" even when addressing my female friends and I guess I just never realized how it can be misinterpreted.
[17:44:17] <coldhead> BillCriswell: there's no telling what some people will find offensive
[17:44:30] <BillCriswell> Yeah. :(
[17:45:08] <coldhead> for some people the word "guy" refers to a short length of rope used in camping. and they find THAT offensive
[17:45:27] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:51:15] <robertmaxrees> and with that i go home.
[17:51:18] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.
[17:52:37] <BillCriswell> I... I just love the internet.
[19:08:23] <Talon_> anybody here decent with jquery ui widgets? I'm new to them and not quite sure how to use them right. I wrote a simple example that works but I have a few questions as how to store things you need.
[19:15:27] <Talon_> well if anybody has the time, my questions are within the JS comments, here is a fiddle, highlight or pm me please. http://jsfiddle.net/rey6sdda/
[19:19:19] <rina> hellos
[19:43:17] <rina> when you use the date object and you use the getTime() method.. does it count the time in milliseconds from the time you created it?
[19:46:21] <BillCriswell> rina: No. It's the time you initiated the object.
[19:53:20] <rina> thanks BillCriswell :) thats what I thought
[20:25:09] <Lirodon> Okay; how would one fill a div with text contained within another?
[20:28:15] <coldhead> Lirodon: $('#destination').html( $('#source') );
[20:28:24] <coldhead> err
[20:28:33] <coldhead> Lirodon: $('#destination').html( $('#source').html() );
[20:42:19] <robertmaxrees> or just .text() instead of .html()
[20:42:38] <Lirodon> Thanks
[21:05:03] <wemini> im ading a jquery ui dialog to my page at runtime. a modal, with high z-index. it renders above the rest of the content ok
[21:05:16] <wemini> but it renders about 1000 pixels lower.. so the screen scrolls down 1000px and shows the dialog
[21:05:28] <wemini> has anyone else seen this behavior?
[21:27:21] <doug16k> wemini, I doubt the z-index is related
[21:28:02] <doug16k> have you removed it as a test and had it behave correctly?
[21:28:50] <doug16k> more likely: the css has a typo that causes top to be 1000 instead of the z-index
[21:30:02] <doug16k> it's funny how browsers bend over backward to deal with bad html but degrade so ungracefully for css typos
[21:30:21] <doug16k> I wish I could put a browser in strict mode that blows up on the slightest invalid thing
[21:31:40] <doug16k> they "yep works in my browser, ship it" mentality causes too much invalid html out there. even when the devs intend to write quality html
[21:37:16] <doug16k> wemini, works for me http://jsfiddle.net/j93tkk0q/
[21:37:49] <wemini> hi doug, yes, i have it working in one version
[21:37:57] <wemini> but in my latest version using react.js it is not working
[21:38:02] <wemini> i also asked the react guys
[21:38:12] <wemini> but wanted to see if someone else had come to this juncture previously
[21:40:55] <doug16k> I tried several ways to trick it into putting the dialog further down but it always showed in the right place. good luck :)
[21:42:25] <doug16k> wemini, can you run your page through an html validator? invalid html usually looks correct enough, but severely misbehaves when js does things with it
[21:42:50] <wemini> thats a good idea. 99% of my app is reactjs tho
[21:42:55] <wemini> which wont compile with invalid html
[21:43:01] <wemini> but you know, i just abandoned the jquery ui dialog
[21:43:13] <wemini> im 90% done creating my own simple dialog, so it's all good ^^
[21:43:17] <wemini> thx doug!
[21:43:23] <doug16k> np
[22:02:02] <bigLanky> currently, I have this: jQuery('#' + k)
[22:02:09] <bigLanky> which adds an id to my element
[22:02:15] <bigLanky> how can i modify this to also add a class?
[22:02:58] <bigLanky> jQuery('#' + k).html('<img src="' + v + '"></div>');     is the full line
[22:03:22] <bigLanky> and that creates <div id="k"><div><img>
[22:03:28] <Uhkis> .addClass()
[22:03:56] <bigLanky> ah that worked
[22:03:59] <bigLanky> thank you
[22:04:58] <mwdev1> anyone able to help me out for a sec, I am trying to optimize some old code. Might be that its getting late and im just not seeing something. Any help much appreciated http://pastebin.com/6U77cts1
[22:06:44] <Uhkis> mwdev1: use .data() instead of attr()
[22:09:56] <mwdev1> Uhkis, on the second attr for data-place?
[22:11:44] <bigLanky> If I have this structure: <div class="mydiv"><img>, is it possible to check if "div img" exists... if not, hide .mydiv
[22:12:09] <bigLanky> right now i am trying img.length to check if it exists
