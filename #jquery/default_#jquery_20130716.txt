[00:00:56] <lemonsparrow> hi all... I have a simple if else here http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/rjap8/ when obj.adEnabled is false, else option is what gets executed help me
[00:02:04] <lemonsparrow> fixed it thanks :)
[00:13:17] <libin> how do i get the scroll location in a mobile device
[00:15:18] <libin> i can get it working on normal desktop by using  $(window).scrollTop()
[00:15:25] <libin> but cant achieve it in mobile
[00:17:20] <lemonsparrow> libin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15353766/saving-scroll-postion-with-jquery-mobile-1-3-list-view
[00:25:58] <lemonsparrow> libin: try #jquerymobile
[00:26:08] <libin> thanks
[00:26:14] <libin> trying it now
[00:43:35] <ipwa> hey guys how can I have this popup activate on hover instead of clicking on the link, so hovering opens up the popup and clicking the close button closes it or if you hover another one: http://jsfiddle.net/n2NyS/5/
[00:50:00] <Cork> ipwa: so bind mouseenter instead of click
[00:51:33] <ipwa> Cork: sorry for the ignorance but could you explain further or possibly direct me to an example somewhere?

[00:52:43] <dan2k3k4> how could I do the same thing as <a href="test"></a> but as a div onclick="" ?
[00:52:54] <ipwa> thx will give it a go
[00:52:58] <dan2k3k4> window.href() ?
[00:53:01] <ipwa> Cork++
[00:53:13] <Cork> dan2k3k4: window.location = 'url' (though don't use onclick...)
[00:53:26] <dan2k3k4> Cork: why should I not use onclick?
[00:53:51] <dan2k3k4> ?onclick

[00:54:03] <Cork> dan2k3k4: 1. if you want to provide a link, use a link, 2. if you absolutely have to use javascript events, use event listeners, not inline
[00:54:46] <dan2k3k4> so like $('#myID').onclick('this') ?

[00:55:00] <dan2k3k4> ah
[00:55:02] <Cork> on('click'
[00:55:25] <dan2k3k4> .on('click', function() { return window.location = 'test'; })
[00:55:35] <Cork> but, ya preferably i would recommend trying to use a normal link instead
[00:56:53] <dan2k3k4> ok

[01:01:38] <soee> what would be the best way to debug this error message: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }" - i have this in console but no info about where it is
[01:02:08] <Cork> soee: you should have a line number for the error
[01:02:14] <Cork> or a file reference at least
[01:03:13] <nesoi> in jqm, how would I scroll down the content area when another element is touched?
[01:04:54] <soee> Cork, nope just the message nothing more
[01:05:02] <soee> (im using Chrome)
[01:05:10] <Cork> soee: try another debugger then
[01:07:02] <soee> Cork, firefox shows nothing, strange
[01:07:13] <Cork> soee: do you have a link?
[01:07:19] <libin> Cork : r u familar with offset.top()
[01:07:29] <Cork> libin: sure
[01:07:51] <Cork> libin: btw you mean offset().top or position().top ?
[01:07:54] <soee> Cork, its project on my machine, not online
[01:09:11] <libin> Cork: my bad.. i meant $(window).scrollTop()
[01:09:55] <libin> is there any alternative for it in mobile devices
[01:10:38] <Cork> i'm quite sure scrollTop should work on mobile too
[01:11:09] <libin> i want to get the value of $(window).scrollTop() and do a function accordingly. its works ok in web, but not in mobile.. in mobile it does not return any values
[01:12:18] <Cork> try $(document.documentElement).scrollTop()
[01:12:44] <libin> ok
[01:12:53] <libin> can i share u the link for my work
[01:13:02] <libin> http://applicate.co.nz/res/
[01:13:09] <libin> thats what i am trying on
[01:13:26] <yuka> hi guys, got some NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE: Component is not available problem, seems that:  B.drawImage(f[0], b, y, U, z);  this is causing it, how could i fix this?
[01:13:46] <libin> i basically needs the logo to animate top once u scroll past second div
[01:15:11] <Cork> yuka: should prob ask that in #javascript; but i would guess at one of your variables pointing at an element/value not allowed to be used in the canvas
[01:15:22] <seutje> yuka: the image wasn't loaded yet?
[01:15:47] <yuka> yeg thats the problem, it happens because image isnt loaded yet, but it should be
[01:16:01] <yuka> maybe adding delay around that draw would help?
[01:16:16] <seutje> maybe using the onload event as the delay?
[01:17:02] <yuka> I think that could be the solution, but this is not my code and it seems really complex dont know where to put such a delay, on this exact line? or somewhere else in code
[01:18:26] <seutje> yuka: preferably before the image gets its src
[01:19:05] <yuka> thanks
[01:19:10] <yuka> gonna try to look for that
[01:23:17] <yuka> seutje: http://pastebin.com/nUPGJhUs - is this the piece of code I am looking for? But it seems it already has wait functions :S weird
[01:24:34] <ravenzz> wow that's some ugly js
[01:24:39] <yuka> I agree
[01:24:43] <yuka> It's not mine
[01:25:17] <seutje> was about to say, I hope this is third party code
[01:26:01] <yuka> its some plugin unlucky for me I can't find better and don't have time to code my own atm :S If I could just fix this problem, with not loading the images, with some simple delay would be awesome
[01:26:34] <seutje> what are you trying to do? play a slideshow on a canvas?
[01:26:50] <ph88> how can i put some html between two elements? i only know append and prepend ...

[01:27:22] <ravenzz> yuka you should look into the waitForImages source
[01:27:27] <seutje> (there's also after of course)
[01:27:29] <seutje> damnit
[01:27:37] <ph88> alter ?
[01:27:52] <yuka> seutje : yeah its a slideshow with special effects..
[01:28:06] <ph88> o/ ravenzz
[01:28:12] <yuka> Sometimes when i first open the page i get blank white spot. and then after refresh It works
[01:28:21] <ravenzz> hail ph88 <o
[01:28:30] <ph88> LoL
[01:28:59] <yuka> ravenzz: the source is i guess pure html , I checked it and it looks ok.
[01:29:18] <ravenzz> yuka waitForImages seems to be a function
[01:29:34] <ravenzz> maybe a plugin
[01:29:36] <yuka> yeh agreed, but it looks for html generated in some class afaik
[01:29:45] <yuka> or am i wrong?
[01:30:16] <ravenzz> maybe, the question is when
[01:30:33] <ravenzz> and the answer should be in its body
[01:31:44] <ravenzz> also seems like that e and n are both referencing jQuery? buh
[01:33:36] <yuka> huh this code is lame .( I am not really sure how to solve this and where to find the "body" of waitforimages
[01:34:32] <ravenzz> do you have any clue of what n is?
[01:35:00] <yuka> nop
[01:35:22] <ravenzz> try to type n.waitForImages in your console and press enter
[01:36:31] <k_sze[work]> ugh, $.browser.version reports '537.36' in Chrome. How do I work with that?
[01:36:51] <Cork> k_sze[work]: what do you mean?
[01:37:13] <yuka> ravenzz where in console can I do that you mean firebug console or in my system backend?
[01:37:33] <ravenzz> firebug console!
[01:37:51] <k_sze[work]> hmm, maybe it's just because I have an old version of jQuery.
[01:38:08] <Cork> k_sze[work]: new versions don't have browser.*
[01:38:21] <k_sze[work]> ya, this is jQuery 1.7.1
[01:38:24] <yuka> ravenzz: ReferenceError: n is not defined
[01:38:55] <k_sze[work]> Cork: 1.9.1 still has it, no?
[01:38:58] <Cork> no
[01:39:03] <Cork> was removed in 1.9
[01:39:20] <ravenzz> yuka did you open the console from that page?
[01:39:26] <yuka> yeah
[01:39:31] <k_sze[work]> I'm on the jQuery.com homepage and $.prototype.jquery is '1.9.1'
[01:39:44] <k_sze[work]> and it still has $.browser.*
[01:39:54] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[01:40:04] <Cork> "version deprecated: 1.3, removed: 1.9"
[01:40:11] <k_sze[work]> ah
[01:40:13] <k_sze[work]> migrate
[01:40:33] <Cork> k_sze[work]: anyway, you get the version for safari/ in the ua
[01:40:47] <Cork> k_sze[work]: also, why do you need to depend on ua sniffing?
[01:42:36] <yuka> hmm ravenzz: I tried one thing, I saw I was caching the html markup and now I tried uncaching it and yet waiting to see if error pops up
[01:42:38] <k_sze[work]> To see whether I need to load the content of an iframe by HTTPS, because the iframe does CORS with another application server
[01:42:54] <k_sze[work]> and XDomainRequest fails if the schemes don't match.
[01:43:13] <Cork> uh... XDomanRequest is ie only
[01:43:22] <k_sze[work]> I know.
[01:43:24] <Cork> why do you need to sniff chrome for it?!?
[01:43:41] <k_sze[work]> Not that I'm trying to sniff Chrome.
[01:44:22] <k_sze[work]> I just happened to try out the $.browser.version property in Chrome.
[01:44:37] <k_sze[work]> And it got me curious
[01:44:44] <Cork> k_sze[work]: also just sniff it instead
[01:44:57] <k_sze[work]> you mean feature detection?
[01:45:00] <Cork> yes

[01:52:35] <joker_89> hi
[01:52:48] <joker_89> how can i remove the parameters of a url and refresh the page iwht jquery?
[01:53:24] <nesoi1> so in jquery mobile, I have a text input in the fixed footer, and when the soft keyboard pops up, the content area scrolls up. How can I prevent this from happening or scroll it back down again?
[01:53:44] <Cork> joker_89: window.location = window.location.replace(window.location.query, '');
[01:53:47] <nesoi1> I tried silentScroll on the textarea tap event with and without a timeout, but it did nothing
[01:53:54] <Cork> opps sorry
[01:53:58] <Cork> joker_89: window.location = window.location.replace(window.location.search, '');
[02:09:43] <_pingu> $('#' + 'elementid').next('.icon') does not find the element with the class icon. I guess the reason ist, that some of the siblings between the tag with elementid and the searched one are hidden. What can i do?
[02:15:06] <nisseni> I'm making a post form, within the form I'm going to have an option to upload an image. Is there a way to just post part of the form? Because as I understand it, having a form in a form is not legit.
[02:48:37] <Kingsy> j javascript
[02:51:33] <doug65536> nisseni: you can disable the fields that you want to suppress in the submit event
[03:00:06] <EdwardIII> hrm when you're authoring a plugin how do you ensure the methods have access to each other if you're using Plugin.prototype.method = function(){ alert('hello!') }?
[03:00:43] <Cork> EdwardIII: this.method ?
[03:00:59] <Cork> you are talking about the public methods after all
[03:01:34] <doug65536> is it not possible to change the border style in jquery in firefox?
[03:01:37] <Cork> EdwardIII: for private methods just have a scope around your function set and call it from there
[03:01:48] <EdwardIII> ah wait, i'm just being stupid heh
[03:01:57] <Cork> doug65536: it's just css
[03:02:08] <EdwardIII> i'm doing the call inside $(window).load(function... so of course `this` doesn't refer to the right object
[03:02:43] <EdwardIII> what's the dealio there, other than the standard var self = this?
[03:03:18] <Cork> EdwardIII: there isn't really one
[03:03:27] <EdwardIII> var self = this it is then heh
[03:03:36] <Cork> i've seen var self = this, that = this, other = this, elm = this...
[03:03:53] <Cork> but ya, i normally use self
[03:04:03] <EdwardIII> hrm waiiitaminute...
[03:04:06] <Cork> depends what this is though
[03:06:25] <doug65536> Cork: yes, what was happening was, I was trying to set it to "none" but that just caused a gap, which bled through the color of the background, so it looked like the style wasn't changing. fix is to set border color equal to background color
[03:07:25] <Cork> doug65536: well none works, it just depends on what you want to do so...
[03:07:44] <Cork> might also be that you get margin collapse when the border is removed
[03:08:13] <EdwardIII> Cork: hrm, `this` doesn't have `options` available here: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/716bc501b539026b4aa1#file-plugin-js-L24
[03:08:21] <EdwardIII> it produces Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'elementsSelector' of undefined
[03:08:32] <doug65536> Cork: sure, "works" and "looks right" are two completely different things
[03:08:46] <EdwardIII> tried changing this.init() to this.init.apply(this) but no joy
[03:09:23] <Cork> EdwardIII: line 46
[03:10:02] <Cork> var self = this; on line 44; and  self.setFilledInElementsAsHadKeypress(); on line 46
[03:10:46] <Cork> doug65536: ya, cause the style you produce gets rendering effects you don't count with
[03:11:00] <EdwardIII> Cork: thing is, i added that, and it still produces the error
[03:11:22] <Cork> doug65536: my point is you can remove the border just fine, as long as the rest of the styling you have doesn't depend on the border
[03:11:35] <Cork> EdwardIII: check what this is in there
[03:11:45] <Cork> put a breakpoint and check where the function is called from btw
[03:11:48] <EdwardIII> Cork: https://gist.github.com/EdwardIII/2d257567d7fbfecff82d
[03:12:49] <Cork> EdwardIII: you don't need  this.init.call(this); this.init() should work just fine
[03:13:25] <Cork> EdwardIII: also if you want help debugging make a working fiddle with the problem
[03:14:03] <lemonsparrow> hi i have an html in which I have a document.ready() and inside the html I have  included 3 js files which have their own respective document.ready() calls... how can I sync 4 of these to work in order..
[03:14:32] <lemonsparrow> sometimes dom breaks here and there due to the async nature of the document.ready() calls
[03:14:57] <Cork> lemonsparrow: where do you have the scripts tags "in the html"?
[03:15:00] <Cork> the head or the body?
[03:15:23] <lemonsparrow> Cork: in the body
[03:15:30] <Cork> then you can't
[03:15:43] <Cork> script tags in the body is async, they run when they get loaded
[03:15:54] <Cork> (external scripts that is)
[03:15:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok but the document.ready() I have inside the html, I want it to run last
[03:16:11] <Cork> it will most likely run first
[03:16:14] <lemonsparrow> Cork: anyway to make it run...
[03:16:16] <lemonsparrow> last
[03:16:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork: somekind of call back ?
[03:16:23] <Cork> it will most likely run first
[03:16:30] <Cork> before the async calls get the data from the server
[03:16:33] <EdwardIII> Cork: here's a simplified version, so the input should turn pink when it has a value= set: http://jsfiddle.net/kfWQP/1/
[03:16:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: All will get executed and On first Called first run basis!!
[03:17:26] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that is sync order yes
[03:17:27] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the data calls happens inside document.ready() for 3 scripts
[03:17:40] <Cork> but the binding of the event listeners is async...
[03:17:46] <Cork> you don't know when they are bound
[03:18:07] <Cork> it is the nature of loading scripts in the body
[03:18:11] <Cork> the page doens't block on them
[03:18:28] <Cork> (and it is the point of loading scripts in the body)
[03:18:43] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3934570/order-of-execution-of-jquery-document-ready
[03:18:46] <lemonsparrow> Cork: will this help ?
[03:19:10] <Cork> no, cause you won't control what order it will push it to the array
[03:19:26] <Cork> you could use an object, and have named keys, and call them in order
[03:20:21] <lemonsparrow> Cork: help me with a hack for this.. all I want is out of the 4 document.ready() I want the one inside html to run last
[03:21:14] <Cork> lemonsparrow: sounds like you should move either the ready you talk about into its own script file
[03:21:21] <Cork> or move the other script files into head
[03:21:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3479713/jquery-multiple-document-ready-queue-order#answer-3479933
[03:21:54] <Cork> lemonsparrow: your missing the point
[03:22:07] <Cork> the problem isn't document ready, it is that your loading the scripts async
[03:23:30] <Cork> EdwardIII: you have a .call() in there
[03:23:36] <Cork> it will reset the this variable to window
[03:23:47] <Cork> line 45
[03:23:50] <Cork> just remove .call
[03:24:25] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/kfWQP/7/
[03:24:31] <joker_89> why i put attr('checked',false) and then attr('checked',true) and gets only false?
[03:24:51] <Cork> joker_89: cause you should not use attr
[03:24:58] <joker_89> what i need to use?
[03:24:59] <Cork> attr is for attributes, and those can only be strings
[03:25:01] <Cork> ?.prop
[03:25:01] <bot-t> .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[03:25:10] <Cork> vs
[03:25:12] <Cork> ?.attr
[03:25:13] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[03:25:20] <joker_89> ok prop
[03:25:25] <EdwardIII> hrm wish you could diff 2 jsfiddles heh
[03:25:38] <Cork> EdwardIII: i just removed .call on line 45
[03:25:40] <Cork> no other changes
[03:26:05] <EdwardIII> ah weird, ctrl+f wasn't finding that line on the other fiddle heh
[03:26:08] <Cork> and i mean literally replace('.call', '')
[03:26:14] <joker_89> and how can i put readonly a checkbox?
[03:26:27] <joker_89> like an iput readonly='readonly'
[03:26:30] <Cork> joker_89: .prop('readonly', true/false)
[03:26:45] <Cork> readonly="readonly" is if you put it in the html source
[03:27:56] <joker_89> but with checkboxes didnt work
[03:29:21] <Cork> hmm i think it does...
[03:29:31] <Cork> joker_89: or are you looking for disabled?
[03:30:24] <Cork> joker_89: http://jsfiddle.net/7T2VR/
[03:30:49] <Cork> ah, ya webkit doesn't support it
[03:31:09] <Cork> so use disabled instead
[03:34:24] <lemonsparrow> Cork: as u said I put the html script into separate file and placed it last... but still it runs before an above ajax http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/cYYnC/ look at the log here
[03:34:29] <EdwardIII> Cork: thanks for those pointers. so how come `this` has access to parent properties, e.g. this.options? is that just how Object.prototype works?
[03:35:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: hence breaking dom
[03:35:09] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the delay will be based on how long the scripts takes to load
[03:35:35] <Cork> if the last script takes less time to load it will most likely load faster, and there by run earlier
[03:35:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: so suggest a neat hack here... hope u got my issue
[03:36:34] <Cork> simplest solution... concat the scripts into one file
[03:37:06] <lemonsparrow> Cork: example pls
[03:37:10] <Cork> or like i said, move the scripts into head where the browser will guarantee the load order
[03:37:27] <EdwardIII> Cork: all working peachy now: http://jsfiddle.net/kfWQP/10/
[03:37:30] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[03:37:40] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ex. cat script1.js script2.js script3.js > script.js
[03:37:44] <EdwardIII> now i can tie this in with a knockout binding and bob's your uncle
[03:39:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: actually scripts have been written to exectue from the point wher they have been placed
[03:39:05] <lemonsparrow> so cant move it to head
[03:39:09] <lemonsparrow> it needs to catch its place
[03:39:22] <AlexIT> Hello can anyone take a look here and tell me how I can get rid of this NAN error? I cant figure it out.
[03:39:26] <AlexIT> http://jsfiddle.net/hvHtN/
[03:40:07] <AlexIT> Change any value in the (result area) to see the error.
[03:41:58] <kishore> Hi, I have created a website, in my site i want to find the scroll position of div it tried the following  function but it doesnt work  $(window).scroll(function () { alert('test') })
[03:42:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: if I put the script in head, how can I specify the point (dom element) from where the file needs to start executing ?
[03:43:54] <Cork> lemonsparrow: uh, you don't?
[03:44:08] <lemonsparrow> Cork: then?
[03:44:15] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok I got another idea
[03:44:23] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you give the script a set of classes or similar and it uses to base its works on
[03:44:35] <Cork> *uses it to base
[03:44:44] <lemonsparrow> Cork: cant I have a script file in head which appends the script files inside html ?? :)
[03:44:52] <Cork> >_<
[03:44:53] <Cork> NO
[03:45:23] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you should read up on unobstructive javascript
[03:45:31] <beasty> hi Cork :)
[03:45:37] <Cork> hi
[03:46:39] <EdwardIII> or require.js?
[03:47:19] <ph88> AlexIT:  looks very scientific
[03:47:20] <Cork> would prob not work if he needs the script tag to base where it should run
[03:47:25] <Cork> EdwardIII: ^
[03:47:48] <walidvb> i recently read an article explaining why a webdesigner/dev should be included early in the conception phase of a website, anyone recalls that? I would like to send it to a prospective client
[03:47:56] <AlexIT> @ph88 Well, it is a program for calculating quantities of materials required in buildings.
[03:48:07] <ph88> dont see any error
[03:48:23] <AlexIT> Well, try selecting a different value from a list.l
[03:48:27] <EdwardIII> Cork: where? i don't see it ^?
[03:48:49] <Cork> EdwardIII: "Cork: if I put the script in head, how can I specify the point (dom element) from where the file needs to start executing ?"
[03:48:50] <ph88> AlexIT:  whats list.l ?
[03:49:04] <AlexIT> For example, run it and click on "Zona Reazem"
[03:49:17] <AlexIT> Then change it to "Zona Camp"
[03:49:21] <Cork> AlexIT: you need to use parseInt(elm.val(), 10)
[03:49:41] <Cork> or possibly parseFloat
[03:49:58] <ph88> AlexIT:  i did that ... where am i suppose to see an error ?
[03:50:09] <AlexIT> at Œæ=
[03:50:09] <Cork> AlexIT: also i told you this the last time, but your html is broken
[03:50:30] <ph88> Œæ=
[03:50:43] <AlexIT> @cork this will be embedded into a wordpress post
[03:50:56] <AlexIT> @it needs to be all in one
[03:50:58] <ph88> first column: Œæ=   second: empty box  3rd: cm
[03:51:01] <Cork> AlexIT: you still have a closing div before any starting div
[03:51:10] <Cork> don't blame wordpress for that :)
[03:52:01] <ph88> ah Cork ... do you think you can set a html field to invalid ?
[03:52:11] <AlexIT> @Ow, well, if it doesnt bother me (as in result in a visible error) I wont notice it
[03:52:16] <Cork> ph88: set what?
[03:52:23] <ph88> :invalid
[03:52:33] <AlexIT> @Cork but thank you, I will research your suggestion to find out how you even use it.
[03:52:52] <Cork> AlexIT: well it might break things as the browser will generate a structure that isn't what it looks like in the html
[03:52:56] <Cork> cause it will error correct it
[03:53:42] <Cork> ph88: are you talking about validation info on an input field?
[03:54:03] <ph88> Cork:  i was considering if i could use html5 field validation to display server validation messages ... setting the message is not a problem ... just how to trigger the field to get an invalid state
[03:54:17] <Cork> ah, then no you can't
[03:54:30] <Cork> validation is triggered by the submit event on the form
[03:54:46] <ph88> i could trigger the submit event on the form with JS ?
[03:55:13] <Cork> ph88: why not just show the error message?
[03:55:33] <Cork> why fake generate a field with an error, when all you can is show a messagE?
[03:55:37] <Cork> *message?
[03:55:55] <ph88> thought it might be nice to have client side validation and server side validation use the same mechanism and layout on the client side
[03:56:32] <Cork> ph88: ah, so you mean if the server validation of a field fails make the field with error?
[03:56:52] <Cork> hmm, not sure if that is possible actually, never fiddled with that
[03:57:00] <Cork> kinda doubt it though
[03:57:10] <ph88> well it's a nice theory to test :P
[03:58:25] <ph88> maybe set the field to empty ... set the custom error message .. trigger form submit so the field(s) get invalid state and get error balloons
[03:59:02] <AlexIT> @Cork Could you leave me the example in a jsfiddle please? I'm trying to find it and I find many different people which use it but no tutorial on it.
[03:59:23] <Cork> AlexIT: example of what?
[03:59:37] <AlexIT> @Cork parseInt(elm.val(), 10)

[04:05:34] <HardDisk_WP> Hey all
[04:05:41] <veeeee> hey guys
[04:05:48] <HardDisk_WP> I'm using array.forEach(function(e) {}); to iterate over an array
[04:05:55] <veeeee> i need some help
[04:06:08] <HardDisk_WP> How do I specify a function to be called when the last element is done?
[04:06:20] <veeeee> http://www.kadesign.com.au/pretail.html
[04:06:29] <veeeee> my added script does not work
[04:06:43] <veeeee> it did work and now it doesnt
[04:06:47] <veeeee> can anyone help me
[04:06:49] <veeeee> i am new
[04:07:23] <Cork> HardDisk_WP: just run it after the forEach
[04:07:24] <daslicht> test
[04:07:37] <daslicht> funny my internet and phone is dead but i can chat in IRC
[04:07:51] <HardDisk_WP> Cork, sorry, I was unspecific: inside the forEach I call a JSON request
[04:08:03] <HardDisk_WP> and I need one line of code executed after the last JSON request is done
[04:08:18] <HardDisk_WP> no matter if it was successful or not
[04:08:33] <Cork> HardDisk_WP: you know the json calls will queue, and then call all at once right?
[04:08:41] <HardDisk_WP> Nope
[04:09:00] <Cork> ajax is async, loops isn't
[04:09:10] <Cork> so the ajax won't happen until the loop ends
[04:09:33] <Cork> well actually the full javascript stack actually
[04:09:49] <Cork> *well the full javascript stack actually
[04:10:09] <veeeee> can someone help me
[04:10:12] <veeeee> please
[04:10:13] <Cork> HardDisk_WP: so if you want them to depends on each other you would have to chain them in each other
[04:10:36] <HardDisk_WP> let me guess, everything other than easy?
[04:10:56] <Cork> you would have to make a recursive function
[04:11:03] <Cork> it isn't super hard, but... :)
[04:11:34] <Cork> veebers: when you ask for help be specific "doesn't work" isn't an error
[04:11:37] <Cork> so what happens
[04:12:29] <veeeee> i added two scripts on one webpage a slider
[04:12:48] <veeeee> and a jquery-lightbox-0.5
[04:13:05] <veeeee> and both stoped working
[04:13:14] <veeeee> and before both worked
[04:13:40] <veeeee> i got the contact script to work with alot of googling
[04:13:43] <Cork> and no error messages?
[04:14:36] <veeeee> one sec there is now cause the pictures are missing
[04:15:09] <Cork> side note you call $(function() { $('#gallery a').lightBox(); }); twice
[04:16:03] <Cork> veebers: also your doctype is invalid
[04:16:39] <Cork> and.. finally your server is dead slow... >_<
[04:16:41] <veeeee> Cork yeah just relised
[04:17:50] <Cork> veeeee: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kadesign.com.au%2Fpretail.html
[04:18:17] <Cork> veeeee: but you should just change your doctype to <!doctype html>
[04:18:26] <Cork> cause that is what you are sending anyway
[04:18:32] <HardDisk_WP> Cork, uuuhhhh is the json-stuff single-thread or multithread?!
[04:18:39] <HardDisk_WP> as in, the json-success callbacks
[04:18:46] <Cork> HardDisk_WP: it's not threaded
[04:18:56] <Cork> but you can have multiple connections to the server
[04:19:04] <Cork> but the callbacks will only be called one at a time
[04:19:15] <Cork> (js is single threaded)
[04:19:21] <HardDisk_WP> ok... wtf, where do the 7 missing callbacks go :D
[04:19:41] <Cork> HardDisk_WP: missing what?
[04:20:14] <HardDisk_WP> 90 entries in the array, but only 83 decrements to the counter
[04:20:15] <veeeee> ??  doctype ahh man
[04:20:16] <Cork> veeeee: this is what it should be and less problematic http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kadesign.com.au%2Fpretail.html&doctype=HTML5
[04:20:41] <Cork> veeeee: the first line in the file
[04:21:04] <veeeee> <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
[04:21:07] <veeeee> this one
[04:21:16] <Cork> yes, replace it with <!doctype html>
[04:21:21] <veeeee> cool
[04:21:48] <Cork> then run the validator and fix the 3 errors in there
[04:22:59] <veeeee> ohh sweet
[04:23:10] <veeeee> that should give me all the errors on the page
[04:23:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: need help with this http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/GTQmu/
[04:23:55] <veeeee> should i keep this line <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
[04:24:20] <Cork> <html> or if you want to be really correct <html lang="en">
[04:24:38] <Cork> lang is optional though
[04:24:56] <lemonsparrow> Cork: will  $.getScript help ? could u pls help me with the code for it... thanks
[04:25:01] <AlexIT> @Cork parseInt(15.99, 10); would return 15, I need the value to be exact.
[04:25:20] <Cork> ?g mdn parseFloat @ AlexIT
[04:25:22] <bot-t> AlexIT, parseFloat - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat
[04:25:24] <b-ot> AlexIT: Sorry, no results for ‚Äümdn parseFloat @ AlexIT‚Äù.
[04:25:29] <veeeee> i like correct thanks
[04:26:00] <AlexIT> However I can use that somewhere else so it was still helpful
[04:26:00] <Cork> lemonsparrow: loadScript won't give you any script tags at all
[04:26:21] <Cork> sorry getScript
[04:26:24] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I hope this should help me solve my earlier issue..
[04:26:32] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok what ever you think would work.. pls help
[04:26:39] <Cork> lemonsparrow: basically if your script is based around where the script tag is
[04:26:51] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yes it is
[04:27:07] <Cork> you're doing it very wrong and it isn't how things should be done for good compatibility
[04:27:14] <Cork> and jquery actually doesn't support that model at all
[04:27:24] <seutje> why would it matter where the scripts are injected?
[04:27:40] <Cork> seutje: most likely cause the script uses the script tag to find other elements
[04:27:49] <Cork> instead of basing it on an id or similar selector
[04:28:34] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok now what's the solution to my issue... having a new script file inside head where these scripts tags are placed in appropriate places should help
[04:28:40] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thats what I am trying to do
[04:29:01] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well it won't handle the reference you talked about though
[04:29:19] <seutje> I didn't know u could easily reference the script tag responsible for executing the script
[04:29:29] <Cork> but if you don't care about where the script is loaded from, as long as it gets loaded in the correct order
[04:29:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork: why wouldnt it ? since we are placing the script tags using jquery in the appropriate places
[04:29:43] <Cork> then there are suddenly multiple ways to do it
[04:29:57] <Cork> lemonsparrow: jquery won't place script tags in the body
[04:30:05] <Cork> it will remove them and execute the script
[04:30:07] <lemonsparrow> Cork: oj
[04:30:11] <lemonsparrow> Cork: oh*
[04:30:34] * lemonsparrow feels hopeless :(
[04:30:42] <seutje> manually injecting script tags is tedious and you don't rly get anything to tell u it's done
[04:30:52] * Cork remeberes the old document.write problem where the message from .write was put into the page everytime the script tag was moved (or a parent)
[04:30:58] <Cork> that was the good old days XD
[04:31:05] <seutje> lol
[04:31:29] <seutje> we still have advertising agencies to abuse doc.write
[04:31:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: seutje 4 document ready functions 3  inside 3 different script files and 4th inside the html... all I want is the 4th one which is inside html should run last
[04:31:49] <Cork> lemonsparrow: what you should do is have either a wrapper or a sibling with an id, then just use that id as a reference for what you need
[04:31:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork: seutje need a solution to this
[04:32:14] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that way you don't get ANY of these problems, and it will just work, without all this messy dependencies
[04:32:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: didnt get u... could u show with a simple code snippet ?
[04:32:48] <Cork> uh...
[04:32:59] <Cork> <div id="wrapper"></div>
[04:33:10] <Cork> $('#wrapper')'.
[04:33:25] <Cork> * $('#wrapper').do-the-things-related-to-the-element
[04:34:07] <seutje> might be interesting to look into dependency management library
[04:34:20] <Cork> lemonsparrow: modern js don't run with a scope reference to where it was injected into the dom
[04:34:26] <Cork> and it actually never has
[04:34:31] <seutje> but they usually don't allow you to just dump stuff inline
[04:34:42] <Cork> it was an old hack for document.write, and it has ALWAYS been messy, and a bad idea
[04:35:06] <Cork> seutje: most of them don't even add script tags
[04:35:11] <veeeee> ok i did the check again
[04:35:16] <Cork> they juse eval the script
[04:35:20] <veeeee> 3 Errors, 1 warning(s)
[04:35:28] <Cork> veebers: yes, so fix those
[04:35:35] <seutje> yeah, but they won't pick up on some straggling inline script block
[04:35:48] <Cork> the errors should be fixed, the warning is good if you do, but not a must
[04:35:56] <Cork> ah, ya
[04:36:01] <veeeee> i dont know lol is that only on the index page
[04:36:05] <veeeee> or all my pages
[04:36:11] <Krambiorix> hi,  how can i , when i close the autocomplete list, scroll to the top , to make it possible to see the first element on next search?
[04:36:30] <Cork> Krambiorix: use the select callback of the widget
[04:36:43] <Cork> and then when it happens scroll the page
[04:37:11] <veeeee> Line 27, Column 21: Unclosed element div.
[04:37:11] <veeeee> <div class="content">
[04:37:24] <veeeee> what is Column 21
[04:37:29] <seutje> character 21
[04:38:21] <seutje> Krambiorix: $(this).data("autocomplete").menu.element.scrollTop(0); on whatever event u want it to happen at
[04:38:37] <veeeee> ahh ok cool
[04:38:39] <Krambiorix> seutje, thanks
[04:38:40] <veeeee> i fixed it
[04:38:48] <Cork> oh, he meant the scroll list :x
[04:38:52] <Cork> missed that >_<
[04:39:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: seutje it looks like this now http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/Y7gBp/ I want the document.ready inside html to run last
[04:39:02] <seutje> actually, u could prolly use the reference to the ui element u get passed in the handler
[04:39:11] <lemonsparrow> Cork: can u show ur logic over this flddle ?
[04:39:23] <Cork> lemonsparrow: sigh, like i said you can't
[04:39:44] <Cork> cause the inline ready will always be parsed before the external scripts, unless you put them before the inline script IN THE HEAD
[04:39:52] <seutje> lemonsparrow: why is this in the html anyway?
[04:40:21] <seutje> move it to a file and call it a day
[04:40:24] <Cork> lemonsparrow: if things depends on the lib, have the lib in the head
[04:40:32] <seutje> or at least first
[04:40:34] <lemonsparrow> seutje: I tried moving it inside a new js file and call it after the rest of the 3 ... still it gets executed before 2 of the above ones hence breaking the dom
[04:40:45] <Cork> if the lib works on it own, you can move it to the end of the body
[04:40:47] <seutje> throwing global functions around is already a bit icky
[04:40:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ^^
[04:41:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: seutje so far whatever I tried doesnt seem to work
[04:41:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork: seutje need u guys experitse here
[04:41:28] <Cork> lemonsparrow: cause you still have dependencies between the files, while they are loaded async
[04:41:29] * lemonsparrow feeling hopeful
[04:41:39] <Cork> i have answered this like 5 times now... >_>
[04:41:58] <Cork> if the external script is in the body, it will run when it get fetched
[04:42:04] <seutje> like I said, if u need dependency management, jQuery isn't going to be much help on its own, it was never designed to handle that
[04:42:09] <Cork> if it is in the head it will block the parser until it has executed
[04:42:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the script within html is own its own... it doesnt depend on anything
[04:42:31] <Cork> lemonsparrow: then you are missing the declaration of showTAb
[04:42:33] <Cork> *Tab
[04:42:38] <seutje> it depends on this global function that's prolly declared in one of those files...
[04:42:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork: can u show thorugh code on pastie.. what u r suggesting as a solution... may be that will help me discern it better
[04:43:11] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i don't fully understand what i should show you
[04:43:25] <veeeee> hey guys can you do the check and help me with the last error
[04:43:31] <Cork> if something depends on it, make sure it loads first; it's as simple as that
[04:43:32] <lemonsparrow> Cork: :(
[04:43:38] <veeeee> its way out my league
[04:43:47] <Cork> to make sure it loads first; have it in the head
[04:44:13] <Cork> or make the separate async resources, NOT depend on each other
[04:44:16] <lemonsparrow> Cork: but the script files have been written in a way that it works from where its placed
[04:44:35] <seutje> that's bad
[04:44:40] <Cork> lemonsparrow: so then you can't get it to work
[04:44:47] <lemonsparrow> Cork: js starts with document.write('<div id="n-campaigns"></div>');
[04:44:53] <seutje> u could click one of those links before the function exists btw
[04:44:58] <Cork> cause the code is written in an obstructive way
[04:45:12] <lemonsparrow> Cork: can I add a line above it find the element where it needs to start execution from n then move it to head ?
[04:45:32] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you can define a function in the head, and call it from the script that defines it i guess
[04:45:37] <Cork> but other then that; no
[04:46:11] <Cork> so ya, the code is broken in quite a few ways
[04:48:09] <veeeee>             <div class="clear slider1Image"></div>
[04:48:09] <veeeee> Contexts in which element div may be used:
[04:48:09] <veeeee>     Where flow content is expected.
[04:48:09] <veeeee> Content model for element ul:
[04:48:09] <veeeee>     Zero or more li elements.
[04:48:34] <veeeee> what does this mean
[04:48:41] <Cork> veeeee: link to the w3c validator site instead
[04:49:20] <seutje> veeeee: you probably have something like <ul><div></div></ul>
[04:49:29] * Cork nods
[04:49:46] <seutje> it's telling u when u can use a div and it's telling you what it expects inside an UL
[04:51:23] <veeeee> so should i put the div out side the ul
[04:51:56] <berryciderspider> need to access the contents of an iframe on a foreign domain
[04:52:25] <Cork> berryciderspider: you can't
[04:52:38] <berryciderspider> Cork: no way at all?
[04:52:40] <Cork> the browser would have a security hole if you where able to do it
[04:52:50] <Cork> you could proxy it over your own server
[04:53:10] <berryciderspider> can you explain that?
[04:53:31] <Cork> the page loads the an url from your server
[04:53:39] <Cork> your server makes a connection to the other domain
[04:53:50] <Cork> grabs the content and sends it back to the page
[04:54:12] <Cork> note though you would lose cookies
[04:54:16] <berryciderspider> could that easily then be put into a php page?
[04:54:20] <Cork> as it would be your cookies not the other sites
[04:54:44] <Cork> you would prob have to have some caching solution to not get terrible performance
[04:55:11] <Cork> like ex. nginx would solve it quite easily
[04:55:20] <berryciderspider> could you parse the html to get specific content, say an article? thus reducing perfomance issue
[04:55:59] <Cork> berryciderspider: do you have control of the third party domain?
[04:56:07] <berryciderspider> Cork: no
[04:56:13] <Cork> then no you can't
[04:56:30] <lemonsparrow> Cork: does browser cache js variable values by default ?
[04:56:40] <Cork> lemonsparrow: cache?!?
[04:57:00] <Cork> no, javascript sits in ram, when the page reloads the js is gone
[04:57:06] <berryciderspider> Cork: so i cant prox y it then?
[04:57:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: or to put the question in a better way doesnt browser cache scripts in html by default ?
[04:57:39] <Cork> berryciderspider: you could proxy it through a server, but all trafic would look like it came from you
[04:57:47] <veeeee> ok my website passed
[04:57:50] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1380197/does-the-browser-cache-javascript-code but his says otherwise
[04:57:54] <Cork> veeeee: nice!
[04:57:57] <veeeee> but i still got Passed, 1 warning(s) and i dont know what it is
[04:58:00] <veeeee> lol
[04:58:00] <berryciderspider> Cork: ok thanks
[04:58:10] <Cork> veeeee: what was the warning?
[04:58:32] <veeeee> dont know cork

[05:38:31] <Cork> jimi_: you could check if the element is :visible i guess

[05:40:22] <okdamn> Cork:  uhm how do i replace img with new one using load ?
[05:40:26] <okdamn> need a wrapper
[05:40:28] <okdamn> div

[05:40:38] <okdamn> ufffff
[05:40:44] <Cork> okdamn: read the link, your mixing up the functions
[05:41:22] <letsgohawks> Could someone let me know why when I click on the two images in this todo list the functions aren't being called   --> http://jsfiddle.net/letsGoHawks/fGdke/17/
[05:41:38] <okdamn> Cork:  can you give me just an example on how to load a new img into a div wrapper?
[05:41:47] <letsgohawks> or if they are ...why nothing is happening
[05:41:56] <Cork> okdamn: why do you need a wrapper?
[05:42:12] <okdamn> Cork:  cause load() puts html inside where you want !?
[05:42:18] <Cork> read the link
[05:42:22] <okdamn> where you want = my img wrapper
[05:42:25] <Cork> read the link
[05:42:26] <Cork> read the link
[05:42:26] <Cork> read the link
[05:43:10] <okdamn> oh oh oh :D
[05:43:15] <xec> lol
[05:43:18] <okdamn> sorry i thought that was for loading external resource
[05:43:24] <okdamn> so i can bind load() to the img ?
[05:43:25] <okdamn> :)))
[05:43:30] <Fusl> heya.. i have a problem: .stop(true) does end an show animation for me but does not clear the timeout where then the initial element gets popped up the full expanded size.. is there a way to prevent this from happening?
[05:43:39] <okdamn> Cork:
[05:43:41] <okdamn> :P
[05:44:00] <xec> okdamn: why dont you just read the answers given to you already
[05:44:46] <okdamn> xec:  yeah my fault i didn't read the link

[05:45:05] <bot-t> okdamn, Try It And See
[05:45:13] <okdamn> ehehe ok
[05:46:13] <okdamn> so now, xec Cox	it seems to work but i need to make that live
[05:46:21] <okdamn> will on('load') work?
[05:46:28] <okdamn> or on('ready')
[05:46:32] <okdamn> exists?
[05:46:36] <xec> the former, yes
[05:46:49] <okdamn> nice
[05:46:57] <xec> okdamn: copypaste from THE LINK: This method is a shortcut for .on('load', handler).
[05:47:09] <xec> okdamn: learn to read! seriously
[05:47:31] <okdamn> xec:  ALREADY TRYED LINK EXMPLAE!!! i still saying that not works live
[05:47:33] <okdamn> :D
[05:48:16] <xec> holy cow, spend some time with the material before saying it won√¶t work. if you really can't get it working like it should, make a testcase with what you've tried
[05:48:27] <xec> s/won√¶t/won't

[06:59:10] <ryorky1> I'm trying to get my makerequest function get a random number, but I can't get it to return anything.  here is my fiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/GRJF2/4/
[06:59:51] <ryorky1> Cork:  any idea what I'm doing wrong?
[06:59:58] <superdoo> hi
[07:00:02] <Cork> how would that code ever execute?
[07:00:13] <Cork> you return x; on line 11
[07:00:23] <superdoo> how to get the "name" of a $(this) object?
[07:00:33] <Cork> this.tagName
[07:00:39] <superdoo> I want to use a part of it
[07:00:40] <Cork> or do you mean the name attribute?
[07:00:51] <superdoo> no
[07:01:18] <Cork> then what do you mean?
[07:01:25] <ryorky1> Cork:  I'm just trying to use the makeRequest function return the value of getRandomNumber
[07:02:08] <superdoo> Cork: eg. a click event handling, in the closure I have the this object. It was #something. I want to get this string
[07:02:13] <ryorky1> Cork:  any ideas?
[07:02:56] <Cork> superdoo: you mean you want the selector used to find the elements to bind the event?
[07:03:16] <superdoo> wait
[07:05:04] <Cork> ryorky1: i don't follow... where do you expect to get the random number from ?
[07:05:20] <superdoo> CorK: http://pastebin.com/Tbdpgzsb
[07:05:53] <Cork> superdoo: lets split this call up to make it possible to understand what it does
[07:06:22] <Cork> $('#giropay, #paypal') this looks through the dom for the elements with those ids; it then creates an array of those matched elements
[07:06:58] <Cork> arr.submit() makes a arr.each(function(elm) { elm.addEventListener('click, func); }); kinda deal
[07:07:15] <Cork> when the submit happens the click event triggers on the element, and your function is called
[07:07:15] <Kingsy> has anyone done much element fading in IE8 ? I am trying to come up with a full proof method. It needs to fade using visibility hidden etc. opacity is better but I had too many problems in IE8, any advice is welcome
[07:07:42] <ryorky1> Cork:  I need to create a function using the function makeRequest(callback)  inside the getRandomNumberRequestor function where makerequest initiates the request
[07:07:43] <Cork> superdoo: so when the event callback happens it has no connection what so ever with the selector you used to create the original list of elements
[07:07:55] <superdoo> Cork, hmm
[07:08:52] <Cork> ryorky1: if i understand your code correctly, getRequest calls getRandomNumber, getRandomNumbers uses setTimeout this causes it to be async so callbacks is needed
[07:09:05] <Kingsy> but tbh, any fading system that works would do.. in IE8 stable
[07:09:15] <Cork> ryorky1: getRandomNumberRequestor never calls anything so not sure how you plan to make that connection
[07:09:40] <Cork> ryorky1: but as getRandomNumber is async, that means the code calling it will end before the timers trigger
[07:09:59] <Cork> ryorky1: and that means you can't use return, cause those would trigger before the data came
[07:10:34] <ryorky1> Cork:  I know it's asynch, but how can I possibly ever call it?
[07:10:39] <Cork> Kingsy: ie8 should work quite well as long as you don't have png images in them
[07:11:07] <Kingsy> Cork: I do I am afriad :(
[07:11:17] <Cork> ryorky1: makeRequest(function(data) { /* your data exist here */ }); /* but can't ever exist here */
[07:11:26] <Kingsy> oh, not png, jpg
[07:11:39] <Kingsy> no transparency
[07:11:43] <Cork> Kingsy: then it should work quite well
[07:11:54] <Kingsy> Cork: I havent found a method to do it yet.
[07:12:04] <ryorky1> Cork:  there is also an onComplete function, couldn't I use it in conjunction w/ it?
[07:12:08] <Cork> you might have to use hasLayout hacks for some elements, but it should be doable
[07:12:31] * Kingsy shruggs
[07:12:33] <Cork> ryorky1: your code doesn't show how it fits in, so can't say
[07:12:34] <Kingsy> I cnt get it goin
[07:15:55] <Kingsy> Cork: are you referring to a regular fadeToggle() ?
[07:16:06] <Kingsy> or animate? or fadeTo? or FadeIn / out ?
[07:16:13] <Cork> Kingsy: anything that uses opacity should work fine
[07:16:34] <Cork> in other words animate, fadeToggle, fadeIn, fadeOut and so on
[07:17:43] <ryorky1> Cork:  here is my original fiddle, with some notes from my boss plus some of my own.  I'm basically tring to display a random number lower than the one in the box:  http://jsfiddle.net/GRJF2/7/
[07:19:34] <Kingsy> Cork: are you sure opacity is used by fadeIn() ? if I set opacity:0; on a element, and fade it in nothing happens.
[07:22:04] <Kingsy> oh i see, I think
[07:22:16] <myosotis> http://jsfiddle.net/QWNq8/ How do I get the widgets created with the "Add" button to count?

[07:23:12] <Kingsy> haha whatever, I am taking a break, this doesnt work
[07:24:41] <Cork> myosotis: http://jsfiddle.net/QWNq8/1/
[07:26:09] <Cork> myosotis: actually http://jsfiddle.net/QWNq8/2/
[07:27:00] <Kingsy> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/KueWL/
[07:27:43] <myosotis> I was hoping to have everything the 'click' event handler needed available in it's scope without having to query the dom each time
[07:28:07] <ryorky1> Cork:  pretty much, but I need it register every click
[07:28:32] <Cork> ryorky1: then you need a queue system
[07:28:44] <Cork> wait a min... there should be one already...
[07:28:48] <Cork> one sec
[07:30:19] <ryorky1> k

[07:35:47] <Cork> ryorky1: http://jsfiddle.net/GRJF2/11/
[07:35:54] <Cork> you need to have a scope to keep the value alive
[07:36:12] <Mackwerk> This may be a ridiculous question but here goes: If I have a conditional operator in a variable can I use that var to test with? for example: var bar = <; if(foo bar baz)?
[07:36:49] <dcherman> Mackwerk: no, not without using eval, which you don't want to do.
[07:37:02] <Mackwerk> dcherman, ok, thanks :)
[07:37:04] <lasha> you can use a ternary operator
[07:37:32] <lasha> var myValue = thing > 3 ? "yes" : "no";
[07:37:48] <Cork> Kingsy: http://jsfiddle.net/KueWL/2/
[07:38:04] <Mackwerk> lasha, the user chooses the operator so I'll just have to check for all of them :)
[07:38:07] <Cork> mackerski: no you can't
[07:38:27] <Cork> lasha: what you can do is have a function and call it
[07:39:02] <Cork> lasha: var bar = function(a,b) { return a < b; }; if(bar(foo, baz)) {}
[07:39:24] <Cork> opps wrong nick...
[07:39:26] <Cork> mackerski: ^
[07:39:27] <Mackwerk> :P
[07:39:30] <Mackwerk> mackwerk_
[07:39:31] <Mackwerk> *
[07:39:57] <lasha> var getNumber = number > 5 ? "greater" : "smaller"
[07:40:04] <lasha> where number = 10
[07:40:08] <lasha> works perfectly.
[07:40:13] <Cork> that only works if you have the value to test before hand
[07:40:21] <lasha> yes
[07:40:41] <ryorky1> Cork:  tnx a bunch!!
[07:40:50] <Mackwerk> If I can't use bar's value then I'll have to check for all cases anyway :p
[07:41:12] <Cork> Mackwerk: why not just make it a function like i showed you?
[07:41:16] <lasha> then use a switch statement?
[07:41:25] <lasha> or a function‚Ä¶ lol
[07:42:05] <Mackwerk> Cork, I'm not sure quite sure how your example works, the user choose an operator from a dropdown and based on that I need to make a check
[07:42:18] <lasha> I taught this to my class
[07:42:23] <lasha> have a switch statement
[07:42:26] <lasha> it's the best router.
[07:42:36] <lasha> we were building a calcuator
[07:42:54] <Mackwerk> lasha, was going use that as well unless Cork's method is smarter
[07:43:02] <Cork> ?eval var options = { '<': function(a,b) { return a < b; }, '>': function(a,b) { return a > b; }, '=': function(a,b) { return a == b; } }
[07:43:05] <bot-t> Cork: undefined
[07:43:18] <Cork> opps forgot that i wrote eval there :X
[07:43:43] <Cork> then you can just do options[userInput](val1, val2)
[07:44:14] <Mackwerk> Cork, pretty neat, one question though, where do you get userInput from?
[07:44:29] <Cork> Mackwerk: the dropdown you talked about
[07:45:27] <Mackwerk> Cork, yes yes but where does the function expect userInput, that's what I'm missing. Is it because it's ternary and it'll test on whatever you put as the [key]?
[07:46:04] <Cork> Mackwerk: the userInput would be '<' '>' or '=' in that example
[07:46:13] <Cork> it is the keys for the object to get what function to run
[07:46:21] <Mackwerk> AH RIGHT
[07:46:29] <Mackwerk> Cork, sorry caps :P Yes, I see now
[07:46:37] <Cork> XD
[07:46:54] <Mackwerk> Cork, brilliant, a colleague taught me to do functions this way and was looking for this exactly
[07:53:36] <wolfehr> is there an equivalent nth-of-type() but rather than within a parent, throughout the entire document?
[07:56:09] <Cork> wolfehr: $('div').eq(10)
[07:57:31] <ezio> can anyone tell me why my auto complete box is getting created so far from the box.  it's outside of the entire main content div
[07:57:32] <ezio> http://te.bluebaron.ca/addaddress
[07:57:58] <wolfehr> perfect, thanks Cork
[07:58:43] <Cork> ezio: what box?
[07:58:52] <ezio> the input box
[07:58:59] <Cork> the search box?
[07:59:07] <Cork> sorry postal code box?
[07:59:10] <BillCriswell> Wouldn't div:nth-of-type(10) work as well?
[07:59:10] <ezio> yes
[07:59:26] <ezio> just type any place in the world
[07:59:30] <BillCriswell> I'm sure .eq(10) is a lot quicker... but not sure on the difference?
[07:59:34] <Cork> ezakimak: it's not offset here
[07:59:45] <ezio> cork it's not visually offset, no
[07:59:50] <ezio> unless you resize your browser
[08:01:37] <Saaether> ezio i resized my browser and its still appearing right below the input
[08:01:43] <Saaether> in chrome any ways
[08:02:21] <ezio> im in chrome and it's not doing it properly
[08:02:40] <ezio> but the main thing is i can't style it because it's outside of the main content area
[08:02:48] <ezio> why the eff would it do that
[08:03:12] <ezio> it even does it in the example version
[08:03:26] <ezio> not as bad though
[08:03:56] <ezio> actually i think it's supposed to be like that in the example
[08:05:55] <ezio> anyone know why the auto complete is so distant from the target in the dom?
[08:05:56] <ezio> http://te.bluebaron.ca/addaddress
[08:07:36] <BillCriswell> I can't get it to autocomplete at all.
[08:07:42] <ezio> type in london
[08:08:21] <Saaether> works fine for me in chrome, doesnt work at all in IE getting script errors
[08:08:28] <BillCriswell> Why does it ask for a postal code?
[08:08:43] <BillCriswell> In Chrome it seems where it should be, though.
[08:08:57] <ezio> visually
[08:09:00] <ezio> again
[08:09:04] <ezio> not talking visually
[08:09:22] <BillCriswell> ezio: Get rid of the last comma after  delay: 1000,
[08:09:36] <BillCriswell> It'll make IE sad.
[08:10:27] <ezio> okay
[08:10:33] <BillCriswell> ezio: It's just how it does it.
[08:10:54] <ezio> well then i'd call that a bug
[08:11:09] <ezio> in the example it doesn't do that
[08:13:16] <ezio> but i still don't think that's the answer
[08:13:51] <BillCriswell> What example?
[08:13:59] <BillCriswell> at jqueryui.com/
[08:14:06] <ezio> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#custom-data
[08:14:52] <BillCriswell> It's doing that there as well.
[08:15:04] <Saaether> yup, adds it to the bottom of the body
[08:16:29] <ezio> Saaether, not for me
[08:16:39] <BillCriswell> Oh boy.
[08:17:03] <ezio> Saaether, in chrome at least it's right below
[08:17:15] <BillCriswell> It's right above the </body>, right?
[08:17:28] <ezio> oh yes i guess hold on lemme add some elements
[08:18:36] <ezio> nope.  adds it before the text object i just added
[08:21:31] <ezio> sorry i got disconnected
[08:21:39] <ezio> <ezio> nope.  adds it before the text object i just added
[08:21:49] <ezio> <ezio> try it for yourself
[08:23:58] <BillCriswell> ezio: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-appendTo
[08:25:18] <stygyan> hello guys
[08:25:30] <BillCriswell> With your code, the auto complete ul is added right before </body>.
[08:25:36] <stygyan> √ßI know this is quite basic but I need help - how do you select the son of the sibling?
[08:25:57] <BillCriswell> Since you don't have a ui-front class on a parent element.
[08:25:57] <stygyan> i mean, the inmediate object under next()
[08:26:14] <BillCriswell> Nor do you have appendTo: option set.

[08:27:17] <drager> If I wanted to create a HTML5 app for phones. How should I manage to storing of data? For example a asking game. One question and it has one right answer. I think like this, store the value in a postgresql database and pushing the right answer to my HTML5 app via json and fetch it via ajax. But if I do that it wont be able to available offline. Sooo?? Any other ideas?
[08:27:23] <stygyan> aw thank you, Saaether
[08:29:11] <BillCriswell> drager: localStorage... might even be able to get away with a cookie?

[09:54:09] <fonko> hey guys, im having an issue with a slider in ie8
[09:54:16] <fonko> an image slider
[09:55:01] <fonko> in all other browsers when i open this slider everything looks fine but in ie8 images are gitting resized, and they are like hyper small
[09:55:26] <fonko> any advice?
[09:57:16] <fonko> besides forgetting about ie8 (damn client wants his site to be correctly displayed in this shitty browser)
[10:21:48] <BillCriswell> fonko: Have you explicitly set the width on the images?
[10:28:30] <fonko> BillCriswell, well i tried with "style" and also with "height" and "width" for the image tag... no luck
[10:31:24] <BillCriswell> fonko: We fixed this issue a while back at work and the I can't think of it now. haha
[10:31:28] <BillCriswell> fonko: Is it with cycle?
[10:34:34] <BillCriswell> fonko: I remember now. If it's cycle do $(winow).load(function(){ $('.slideshow').cycle(); }); IE8 does something weird with the loading of the images?
[10:36:45] <fonko> BillCriswell, i dont think its cycle
[10:37:18] <fonko> BillCriswell, actually i dont know if this is a plugin or someone did it before me haha... i just got the full mess passed to me :(
[10:37:19] <BillCriswell> Try wrapping whatever JS works with the image in $(window).load(function(){ ... });
[10:37:21] <fonko> i hate this haha
[10:37:32] <fonko> mmm ok
[10:38:11] <BillCriswell> fonko: If you can resave the images as progressive that may also save you some headache.
[10:38:19] <drager> Can I use the jquery mobile dialogs as an alert within my js code?
[10:40:48] <BillCriswell> fonko: http://www.webmonkey.com/2013/01/the-return-of-the-progressive-jpeg/ semi-related.
[10:48:23] <fonko> BillCriswell, checking, thanks buddy
[10:48:30] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[10:52:46] <Mac_Weber> I think I read somewhere that there is an attribute that can be set and it would automatically update other elements which read this attribute. I thought it was .data() but I cannot remember... anyone knows how to do it?
[10:57:49] <BillCriswell> Mac_Weber: Not following you. You can do $('#foo').data('name', 'joe'); or <div id="foo" data-name="joe"></div> and read either with $('#foo').data('name');
[10:58:28] <BillCriswell> If you update it through .data() the attribute won't reflect it.
[10:58:54] <Mac_Weber> BillCriswell: I know, but I read it is possible to set other elements to read the new data as soon as it changes
[10:59:42] <BillCriswell> It sounds like you want something along the lines of like model/view bindings?
[11:00:59] <Mac_Weber> BillCriswell: not sure, maybe...
[11:01:44] <Aubrey101_> the facebook timeline feature is there a jquery equivalent ?
[11:02:02] <arwolfe> Can someone help with JQ 1.9.0 + IE7 setting the attribute value for 'placeholder'? I get an error 'Member not found' in JQ source line 2552. Is this a common problem and is there a fix?
[11:03:02] <BillCriswell> Mac_Weber: Soemthing along the lines of the first example here? http://angularjs.org/
[11:05:04] <Mac_Weber> BillCriswell: yes
[11:05:59] <Gmac_> hi can any help me with creating a touch event? i used touchmove and had it set that once your finger goes 100px down it should stop
[11:06:03] <Gmac_> but then it never works again
[11:06:14] <Gmac_> and i can't find any tutorials or anything
[11:06:23] <Gmac_> I'm trying to pull down a menu
[11:06:31] <Gmac_> hidden at the top
[11:08:44] <BillCriswell> Mac_Weber: The only way I could think of duplicating that with jQuery is http://jsbin.com/okavoq/1/edit on short notice.. would probably have to think about it more haha
[11:10:36] <Mac_Weber> BillCriswell: I see some people talking about the event 'changeData', but I don't see it on docs http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5410314/jquery-data-and-changedata-event
[11:12:49] <BillCriswell> Mac_Weber: Yeah, looks like an older question. Never heard much about that.
[11:17:07] <epicowl> anyone using chosen plugin? I'm having issue where when I select an option, it is not removed from the drop down list, only greyed out...
[11:27:44] <epicowl> anyone with chosen experience in here? Im using ajax-chosen and having issue where the option is not removed from the available options list when I select it
[11:27:49] <drager> Any idea how I can make a thumb image and then resize it onclick like a lightbox (popup) in jquery mobile? I tried; <img data-role="popup" class="popup" src="static/img/img.png">
[11:27:51] <epicowl> it's just greyed out
[11:31:53] <drager> Solved it ;)
[11:42:44] <baordog> How would I test to see if a certain element is not in focus?
[11:43:31] <blindMoe> baordog:   $('.foobar').is(':focus')  maybe?  I haven't had to do that but it may work
[11:55:24] <baordog> When you click inside a textarea it should be in focus right?
[11:56:55] <BillCriswell> baordog: Yesh.
[11:58:06] <baordog> http://pastie.org/8146582 - basically my keyboard shortcut is being fired even when I'm using my search bar
[11:59:29] <BillCriswell> baordog: What is "SearchSearch"?
[11:59:37] <NoiseEee> yeah, bad selector baordog
[11:59:51] <baordog> It's the selector for my search bar
[11:59:58] <baordog> I tried input,textarea - didn't work either
[12:00:11] <BillCriswell> Do you have a <SearchSearch> element?
[12:00:30] <NoiseEee> baordog: its a bad selector
[12:00:40] <baordog> SearchSearch is the id for the text area
[12:01:04] <NoiseEee> fine, the syntax is bad.
[12:01:29] <BillCriswell> baordog: You'd want #SearchSearch in that case, not just SearchSearch.
[12:01:45] <baordog> Didn't I put input#SearchSearch ?
[12:01:57] <baordog> at least that's what I'm up to know
[12:02:00] <baordog> *now
[12:02:01] <BillCriswell> baordog: No, you have input,SearchSearch
[12:02:05] <baordog> ah
[12:02:18] <NoiseEee> and you don't need "input" at all.
[12:02:22] <NoiseEee> an ID is an ID
[12:02:37] <baordog> no dice
[12:02:53] <NoiseEee> baordog: perhaps you can make up a jsfiddle
[12:05:00] <baordog> http://jsfiddle.net/K5yzn/
[12:05:56] <BillCriswell> baordog: What's your goal?
[12:06:15] <baordog> for the search bar to ignore the keyboard shortcut
[12:06:23] <baordog> so you don't get a redirect when you type
[12:09:59] <drager> Can you use jquery mobiles dialog as alert?
[12:12:17] <BillCriswell> baordog: http://jsbin.com/ucinuv/1/edit like this?
[12:14:04] <BillCriswell> You could even stop the event from bubbling up instead of doing this.
[12:15:57] <BillCriswell> baordog: http://jsbin.com/ucinuv/3/edit
[12:24:04] <gkilian> How can you store plugin defaults into a cookie and then retrieve them?
[12:26:13] <baordog> BillCriswell: Thanks that did the trick.
[12:26:21] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[12:31:15] <BulleTTime> hay i was looking for a way to animate from one rgba color to another. possible?
[12:31:39] <dabear> BulleTTime: yes, use the color animate plugin
[12:32:15] <Mac_Weber> BillCriswell: thank you for helping earlier. I will research better what I'm going to do.
[12:32:35] <BillCriswell> Mac_Weber: Enjoy!
[12:32:38] <BillCriswell> And Welcome.
[12:32:57] <dabear> BulleTTime: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/
[12:34:19] <BillCriswell> That gnarf can write a mean plugin.
[12:38:09] <gkilian> What's the best way of storing plugin defaults into a cookie and then applying them back on init
[12:40:15] <spobat> I just detected some sn=""  attribute on a jquery element i dynamically created
[12:40:26] <spobat> however, i cannot remember of ever using such an attribute
[12:41:03] <nesoi> in JQM, when the soft keyboard displays, the content area scrolls up by the amount displaced by the keyboard. How do I keep that from happening?
[12:41:08] <nesoi> (android)
[12:41:18] <gnarf> BillCriswell: to be fair - danheberden helped design that one ;)
[12:46:04] <BillCriswell> I bet there's lots of smart people in here who never talk haha.
[12:46:16] <BillCriswell> Probably busy "working". Suckers. =)
[12:48:08] <nesoi> no JQM people here?
[12:49:08] <arschmitz> nesoi: Hi what can i help with?
[12:49:14] <nesoi> hi arschmitz!
[12:49:23] <nesoi> in JQM on Android, when the soft keyboard displays, the content area scrolls up by the amount displaced by the keyboard. How do I keep that from happening?
[12:49:53] <arschmitz> you dont! it happens for a very good reason its because otherwise the keyboard would hide the input
[12:50:17] <nesoi> in this case, the keyboard is hiding data by scrolling it up out of the way
[12:50:33] <arschmitz> data or the input?
[12:51:16] <nesoi> the input is a textarea in the fixed footer. that's fine. The problem is that the content area has data which needs to be seen, and it scrolls up so that the data isn't visible
[12:51:43] <arschmitz> got ya. this is native behivor though has nothing to do with JQM
[12:52:18] <nesoi> arschmitz : I'm not trying to assign blame, just trying to find a way to make it do what I need
[12:52:39] <arschmitz> nesoi: i understand but there is no real way around in
[12:52:52] <nesoi> I tried putting a tap event on the textbox and calling silentScroll(0) either immediately or with a timeout
[12:52:56] <nesoi> but nothing happened
[12:53:25] <nesoi> I need to scroll the content area back by the amount it is scrolled up by the soft keypad
[12:53:34] <nesoi> if I can't keep it from scrolling
[12:53:41] <arschmitz> yeah the native behivor locks everything while it takes place
[12:53:52] <nesoi> the timeout should have fixed that no?
[12:54:00] <arschmitz> so you cant prevent it
[12:54:25] <nesoi> or, can I trigger the silentScroll on a keypad display completed event or something?
[12:54:38] <arschmitz> you could do it on focus
[12:54:50] <arschmitz> but you would have to know how much to scroll which is the hard part
[12:54:51] <nesoi> focus of the textarea?
[12:54:56] <arschmitz> yes
[12:54:58] <nesoi> I would scroll to the top
[12:55:07] <LLckfan> Does any1 know anything about GE dishwashers
[12:55:08] <nesoi> but silentScroll doesn't seem to be working
[12:55:13] <arschmitz> ok then on focus scroll to top
[12:55:52] <Gmac_> how do i prevent default on an anchor ABOVE my touchevent
[12:56:00] <nesoi> focus event won't happen until after the keyboard finishes displaying?
[12:56:01] <Gmac_> cause some people have fat fingers
[12:56:09] <arschmitz> nope
[12:57:57] <nesoi> arschmitz : so just $.mobile.silentScroll(0); ?
[12:58:38] <arschmitz> nesoi: i have not test obviously but yes that should work
[12:59:21] <nesoi> didn't work
[12:59:36] <nesoi> content area still scrolled up and silentScroll did nothing
[13:00:48] <LLckfan> Hello
[13:01:24] <nesoi> arschmitz : I don't think silentScroll is scrolling the content area for some reason
[13:02:11] <skione> hey I have a strange problem I have this code that grabs all the fields on a form and creates query string http://pastebin.com/T6xB70qb it works except for checkboxes which it always reports as on even if its not
[13:02:56] <skione> is that because you have to use is(':checked')?

[13:04:13] <MariusIT> hi guys, i need a little help cloning feature1 and creating the remove effect here http://jsfiddle.net/L9YCn/13/ any ideeas?
[13:05:05] <nesoi> arschmitz : the focus event is triggered on tap, before the keyboard displays
[13:05:54] <arschmitz> what android version are you using its been a while since i delt with this before?
[13:06:10] <nesoi> 4.1.1 in this case
[13:06:13] <FernandoBasso> I can't make a jquery plugin work on an ajax-loaded content. I do call it inside the success callback function, but I get "cannot convert 't' to object".
[13:06:16] <FernandoBasso> It is fancybox.
[13:07:41] <arschmitz> nesoi: what device?
[13:08:14] <nesoi> htc evo 4g lte... but I was hoping for a general solution :)
[13:08:27] <dannydagger> hey guys.. does anyone know how to change the background color of a navbar button onclick using bootstrap?
[13:08:53] <arschmitz> nesoi: just checking some devices have weird scroll issues but have not seen any myself on that one
[13:10:42] <Otineb> hey guys, is there a way to target an html comment with jquery? or more specifically, target all the code between two comment tags (including the tags themselves)?
[13:11:26] <NoiseEee> Otineb: considering they're ignored by the browser, i should think no.
[13:12:44] <naeluh> hey does anyone know why my form on the left flashes the validation text a bit before it operates correctly which is being hidden ? this is the link http://hulea.org/ its the form on the left side?
[13:14:02] <naeluh> thanks !
[13:14:25] <baordog> is there a way for jquery to temporarily modify css rules?
[13:14:26] <Otineb> @NoiseEee darn‚Ä¶. I've been tasked with moving some form elements around a page. The problem is this is on a closed system and the templates are not accessible to me. The whole thing is further complicated by the fact that the system is seeking specific comment tags to parse form data to the next page. (e.g. <!--Address--><input type="text" name="address"><!--/Address-->) Removing the input without the comments breaks the form.
[13:14:34] <baordog> Would that be what a media query would be for?
[13:15:28] <nesoi> arschmitz : so I got it to work in a very kludgy way. It had to be the tap event because if the textarea was focused and the keyboard dismissed, it wouldn't get another focus event when tapped again. If I put in a 1 second timeout, it works. But that sucks. I really need the silentScroll to happen when the keyboard finishes displaying. Is there any way to detect that?
[13:15:47] <NoiseEee> Otineb: good luck!
[13:16:11] <arschmitz> nesoi: not that i know of
[13:16:44] <Otineb> @NoiseEee thanks
[13:17:05] <LLckfan> Hello
[13:17:05] <LLckfan> Does any1 know anything about GE dishwashers
[13:17:25] <nesoi> arschmitz : any chance of that getting added to jqm??
[13:17:44] <nesoi> or any other workaround?
[13:17:53] <arschmitz> no because there would have to be some sort of native even for jqm to bind to
[13:18:13] <nesoi> there is a soft keyboard event I see in my logcat
[13:18:43] <nesoi> with the message "ignore this event" oddly
[13:20:10] <nesoi> arschmitz : is there something I'm doing wrong that makes this a problem for me? I put the textarea in the fixed footer because otherwise it ended up scrolled off the bottom of the screen with a giant blank area for my listview above it
[13:20:11] <ScottO_1> anyone familiar with highsharts?
[13:20:29] <ScottO_1> *highcharts
[13:21:19] <arschmitz> nesoi: generally fixed position inputs are a bad idea on android in general
[13:21:28] <arschmitz> they can cause a lot of problem and are to be avoided
[13:21:40] <arschmitz> but no your not doing anything wrong
[13:22:43] <nesoi> arschmitz I did it because I couldn't figure out how to set the vertical size of the listview.
[13:23:04] <arschmitz> nesoi: its set by the content you have in them
[13:23:16] <arschmitz> they dont have an explicit height
[13:23:46] <nesoi> arschmitz : it doesn't seem to be. With only 1 item it was longer than the screen area
[13:24:01] <arschmitz> then you have something else going on
[13:24:03] <nesoi> but maybe that's because I'm using jquery scrollz to do lazy loading
[13:24:44] <nesoi> also if I didn't have the textarea in the fixed footer, the buttons under the textarea in the footer didn't move up when the keyboard appeared
[13:27:18] <guideX> in ie8/jquery 1.7.2, when I turn on debug, I see this error happening near "try{delete p.test}catch(r){b.deleteExpando=!1}" ...  "Caught exception occurred : Object doesn't support this property or method "
[13:27:20] <ScottO_1> in highcharts all my decimal values show, then after moving the cusor around on the line, it displays .000 for every value
[13:27:29] <guideX> am I supposed to be using an older version of jquery or something
[13:27:46] <nesoi> arschmitz : so putting elements in the fixed footer is generaly considered bad?
[13:27:57] <arschmitz> nesoi: thats because its doing it because its trying to bring the textarea into middle of screen
[13:28:02] <arschmitz> not elements just inputs
[13:28:16] <MariusIT> guys, how can i clone the initial input div when i click create http://jsfiddle.net/L9YCn/18/ ?
[13:28:22] <arschmitz> nesoi: it does not take into account that the textarea is position fixed
[13:29:03] <nesoi> I want the textarea to go up, along with the buttons under it. I just don't want it to cover the scrolling content area.
[13:29:13] <nesoi> I guess I have to play around with it more.
[13:29:49] <nesoi> arschmitz : why is it bad to put inputs in the fixed footer? how about in the fixed header? I do that too :)
[13:30:11] <arschmitz> nesoi: its anything position fixed
[13:30:15] <arschmitz> because of bugs in android
[13:30:55] <nesoi> so what happens in what android versions arschmitz
[13:31:42] <arschmitz> nesoi: it a variety of things ranging from making the whole page non responsive to breaking select menus to causing clicks / taps to pass through to elements below
[13:31:48] <nesoi> putting stuff in the fixed header and footer was the only way I could make it work
[13:32:29] <arschmitz> and only happens with certain combinations of css and elements very hard to predict
[13:32:32] <nesoi> like, I have a contact list display, and the search for it is in the fixed header
[13:32:54] <nesoi> I don't know where else I would put that
[13:33:04] <arschmitz> nesoi: im not saying dont do it but its known to be troublesome the worst issues are on 2.x versions of android
[13:33:27] <arschmitz> which are still at over 40% of androids last i checked
[13:34:13] <nesoi> a jqm app is probably too slow on those phones anyway though
[13:34:46] <nesoi> it's almost too slow on my phone as it is
[13:34:47] <arschmitz> nesoi: it should not be we test on everything back to 2.2
[13:35:20] <nesoi> so including 2.2 there are currently 37.2% 2.x versions
[13:35:36] <arschmitz> ok so i was pretty close i said 40 last i checked
[13:35:38] <LLckfan> Does any1 know anything about GE dishwashers
[13:35:40] <nesoi> heh
[13:35:47] <NoiseEee> LLckfan: yes, this is the place
[13:35:53] <nesoi> those people should upgrade already!
[13:36:09] <LLckfan> Is there a secret to turnthemon
[13:36:10] <nesoi> I have a 2.3 device but I leant it to a friend... seems I need it back for testing
[13:36:28] <LLckfan> I have the knob on what was cycle I want andthe door locked
[13:36:28] <NoiseEee> LLckfan: whisper sweet nothings and play them a lot of compliments
[13:36:34] <LLckfan> But nothing happens
[13:36:39] <nesoi> arschmitz : is there a way to detect the version and display a different page?
[13:36:55] <nesoi> sounds annoying though
[13:40:14] <nesoi> arschmitz : what should I do to get jqm to display as fast as possible? I already disabled rounded corners and shadows...any other advice?
[13:40:36] <arschmitz> nesoi: we have made dramatic improvments for 1.4
[13:40:44] <arschmitz> which the alpha will be out this week
[13:41:23] <nesoi> nice... what version of jquery should be used with it? btw, one issue I've run into with the JQM download page is that it hasn't specified what version of jquery is compatible with each JQM version?
[13:41:27] <nesoi> . not ?
[13:41:54] <arschmitz> nesoi: 1.3 works with 1.7-1.9
[13:42:04] <arschmitz> 1.4 will be 1.8-1.10
[13:42:27] <nesoi> is the highest jquery version recommended, or is another one more stable?
[13:43:47] <arschmitz> i would personally always use the newest recomended because it will have all the new features and bug fixes
[13:43:56] <arschmitz> but they should all work equally
[13:44:06] <dannydagger> hey guys.. does anyone know how to change the background color of a navbar button onclick using bootstrap?
[13:44:26] <nesoi> cool... so besides going with 1.4, any other recommendations for speeding things up as much as possible?
[13:45:21] <nesoi> btw, do you have any opinion on jquery scrollz or any other lazy loader? I had to implement it because I have over 600 contacts and it was taking over 30 seconds to load the contacts page.
[13:45:41] <arschmitz> no never used it
[13:45:52] <arschmitz> but i can tell you even lazy loading i would not recomend a page that big
[13:45:59] <arschmitz> i would recomend you implement paging
[13:46:13] <nesoi> because of memory usage?
[13:46:27] <arschmitz> yes and most platforms wont actually render a page that long anyway
[13:46:49] <nesoi> I did test that on my 2.3 phone and it actually seemed to work ok
[13:47:22] <nesoi> paging is not very usable for a contact list with multiple select
[13:47:30] <nesoi> or at least I can't think of how to make it very usable
[13:48:05] <guideX> does appendTo not work in ie8?
[13:48:51] <nesoi> arschmitz : how would you implement a contact list with multiple select other than as a long scroll with search?
[13:48:58] <nesoi> any other good ways?
[13:49:27] <arschmitz> i would do it paged and have an ajax data source for search
[13:49:40] <nesoi> this is a phonegap app
[13:50:14] <nesoi> I'm searching the user's contact list
[13:50:38] <nesoi> when you say paged, you mean one screen at a time or how?
[13:50:53] <arschmitz> do like 10 contacts per page
[13:50:57] <arschmitz> and multiple pages
[13:51:10] <arschmitz> and have the search link to an ajax data source
[13:51:13] <nesoi> because that brings up the issue of how do you get the listview to fit in one screen without scrolling
[13:51:14] <arschmitz> of the contacts
[13:51:31] <nesoi> because if you have to scroll each page a little, and then page to the next one, that would be annoying
[13:53:19] <nesoi> arschmitz : so is there a way to get the data to fit in one screen without scrolling? ie: how do you know when you can't add another row without making the screen scroll?
[13:53:38] <arschmitz> nesoi: thats something you would have to work out for your self
[13:54:53] <nesoi> arschmitz : it's a general question though: is there a way in JQM to implement paging such that each page fills a screen but doesn't cause it to scroll?
[13:55:01] <arschmitz> no
[13:55:27] <nesoi> so that's a problem
[13:55:35] <guideX> why doesn't this work in ie8? http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=39513
[13:55:46] <guideX> but does in other browsers
[13:55:55] <guideX> $("#trip_search_results").append(completedTemplate); being the problem
[13:56:26] <nesoi> arschmitz : would it be possible to specify the height of each line and calculate whether adding another line would cause scrolling?
[13:56:53] <arschmitz> yes you could do that through a combination of css and JS
[13:57:24] <nesoi> cool... how would that work? seems like it would be a good capability to have
[13:58:14] <arschmitz> you would in your css set an explicit height for each line
[13:58:37] <arschmitz> then you would have to implement as part of yoru lazy loading a calculation that determins the total height of the list
[13:58:54] <arschmitz> and check that against the screen height minus your header and footer
[13:59:05] <nesoi> is there a way to know the available content area (minus the header and footer sizes) and the existing height of the list?
[13:59:06] <arschmitz> and see if there is enough room for another one
[13:59:36] <arschmitz> yes check the height of each and add / subtract to get the value you are looking for
[14:00:15] <nesoi> each div? like header, footer and content? or do you have to check each element (ugh)?
[14:00:41] <arschmitz> each outermost element within the page so like header footer and content
[14:00:50] <nesoi> hm. maybe not too bad
[14:03:19] <MobCat> i'm doing $(document).on('click','#a_tag_element', function(e) { }); and intercepting e.which 2 (middle click) but it won't halt it with return false or e.preventDefault
[14:03:48] <MobCat> it works with $('#a_tag_element).click(....
[14:04:02] <MobCat> but i can't use that
[14:04:02] <MobCat> is there a way to get it working with document on?
[14:04:17] <nesoi> arschmitz : why would you do an ajax search rather than just having the contacts in memory? to save memory or for another reason?
[14:04:36] <nesoi> I find that even on a slow 2.3 device, I can do a sequential search after each character is typed and it seems fast
[14:06:15] <MobCat> ah looks like jquery doesn't deletect click handlers other than left click
[14:06:41] <MobCat> delegate
[14:15:08] <epicowl> hello, I am using chosen library 10.1 in addition to ajax-chosen and I am getting this effect when I select an option from the drop down list http://i.imgur.com/WEXrqFh.png

[14:29:57] <quuxman> I'm working on uploading files via drap and drop. On one of my pages, none of the drag events (drag, dragover, dragenter, drop) have any effect, but on another page in a different domain they do fire when expected
[14:30:39] <quuxman> any ideas of what's going on? If I drop a file onto the page where drag events don't work, nothing happens, where if I drop it into the page where they do work, it loads the file
[14:31:23] <quuxman> seems that there's some sort of global drag disabling for the whole domain. Doesn't seem to matter what's in the source
[14:31:45] <grafi> got the url so we can take a look?
[14:32:34] <quuxman> grafi: it's all local
[14:32:51] <quuxman> hmmm, maybe it's because it's localhost

[14:53:37] <grafi> clone?
[14:56:04] <MariusIT> create a new div under it with a empty input
[14:59:20] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/L9YCn/20/ like that?
[15:00:31] <MariusIT> grafi: exactly, but with Create available on the new divs as well
[15:00:48] <blindMoe> MariusIT: just change id to a class and it will work
[15:00:57] <blindMoe> your script is creating elements with duplicate id's which is a no no
[15:01:35] <MariusIT> noup, dosen't work with class http://jsfiddle.net/L9YCn/21/
[15:01:54] <Ose> so I had a script inside <script> tags in a html document that would correctly change my page content when I .click-ed a button. Then I moved the excact contents of the <script> tags into a separate JS file and included it instead. now nothing happens when I click the button, why?
[15:02:07] <Ose> everything else seems to be working except the .click
[15:02:34] <MariusIT> Ose: $('#clickedDiv').on("click", function () { //stuff });
[15:03:00] <blindMoe> Ose: check if any errors are being thrown and then make sure that your code is in a $(document).ready( function() { ... }); block
[15:03:16] <grafi> `delegation MariusIT
[15:03:33] <grafi> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[15:04:31] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/L9YCn/24/
[15:04:34] <Ose> blindMoe: putting it inside a document ready worked. it didn't need to be in one when the code was in the html document though
[15:04:57] <blindMoe> Ose: probably because it was at the end of your file.. even though it probably _should_ have been in one anyway
[15:05:17] <MariusIT> grafi: ahaaaaaaaaa
[15:05:24] <MariusIT> i wonder if it works the same for delete
[15:05:30] <grafi> sure
[15:05:32] <grafi> why not
[15:05:34] <grafi> o√¥
[15:07:21] <MariusIT> just one question, how do i target the current div?
[15:08:47] <MariusIT> noup, dosen't work with delegate http://jsfiddle.net/L9YCn/27/
[15:09:04] <MariusIT> it uses only the first div
[15:11:38] <blindMoe> MariusIT: get rid of the ID's.. it is bad practice to be duplicating IDs
[15:11:47] <MariusIT> roger that
[15:13:17] <MariusIT> done http://jsfiddle.net/L9YCn/28/
[15:16:45] <blindMoe> MariusIT: that doesn't work very well ;)
[15:17:02] <MariusIT> yea ... i'm trying to figure out why ...
[15:18:43] <MariusIT> blindMoe: was working with id ... what changed?
[15:18:48] <blindMoe> because you are cloning every .feature
[15:21:03] <MariusIT> but i defined the template first? i should be cloning only that variable ...
[15:22:34] <grafi> http://jsfiddle.net/L9YCn/37/
[15:24:25] <ProLoser> is there a simple way to send all events from one dom element to another dom element?
[15:24:59] <guideX> why would appendTo not work in ie8?
[15:25:01] <blindMoe> grafi: nice
[15:25:01] <ProLoser> or do i have to do like .bind('click mouseover mouseout doubleclick', fn(elm){ elm2.trigger(elm) })
[15:25:08] <MariusIT> grafi: nice
[15:25:34] <MariusIT> grafi: is there a way to actually remove the deleted feature and not just hide it?
[15:25:39] <grafi> remove()
[15:25:44] <grafi> and then remove the :visible too
[15:25:46] <grafi> :)
[15:26:46] <MariusIT> if i add remove, that will delete the initial template as well and create would not work
[15:30:30] <grafi> so either keep the template separate from the stuff you create and remove
[15:30:47] <grafi> or hide/remove based on how many features are left
[15:37:18] <MariusIT> grafi: it worked! http://jsfiddle.net/L9YCn/39/ :D

[15:47:49] <mike_f> I have a div which I dump some error HTML text into, and I'd instead like it to be turned into page elements. Is there an easy way to do this?
[15:48:27] <MariusIT> grafi: yes i tryed, it's not a valid command
[15:48:45] <grafi> :P
[15:48:48] <MariusIT> :)
[15:49:29] <mike_f> At the moment I'm doing something like: $('#error_area').text(htmlErrorResponse);
[15:49:55] <mike_f> htmlErrorResponse in this case starts with <HTML> and ends with </HTML>
[15:50:27] <mike_f> So my intuition is to perhaps dump it into an iframe.
[15:50:30] <eddiemonge> mike_f: why not send back a page partial?
[15:51:00] <guideX> how do I make this work in ie8? $(target).append(this._myarray[i]);
[15:51:26] <mike_f> What's a page partial?
[15:51:35] <eddiemonge> guideX: depends on what that is
[15:51:48] <eddiemonge> mike_f: just the relevant html instead of a full html page
[15:52:02] <eddiemonge> mike_f: or even better, return json and then format it
[15:53:07] <guideX> it's an array item
[15:53:12] <guideX> not rendered
[15:53:31] <mike_f> The response pages are from an ASP.NET server, and I want to get to the raw errors when the underlying code goes boom.
[15:53:32] <eddiemonge> guideX: i mean that is perfectly valid code. what doesnt work on that line?
[15:53:47] <guideX> in ie8, the appened object isn't added
[15:53:52] <mike_f> When that happens, I don't get json as a result, I get an HTML page.
[15:53:54] <guideX> in all other browsers works fine
[15:54:00] <eddiemonge> mike_f: you cant have asp.net output errors in a specific format?
[15:54:27] <eddiemonge> guideX: what is this._myarray[i] ? are you doing this in a loop?
[15:54:31] <guideX> yeah
[15:54:44] <mike_f> I can if the error is under my control, but for a misconfiguration, and for something not otherwise built up, it produces a web page in html.
[15:54:47] <guideX> it's an array with several parameter
[15:54:47] <guideX> s
[15:55:18] <eddiemonge> guideX: maybe your loop is broken. i really need surrounding code to help further
[15:55:24] <eddiemonge> guideX: what version of jq?
[15:55:27] <guideX> 1.7.3
[15:55:34] <guideX> hmm I can show more, hold on
[15:55:45] <eddiemonge> mike_f: then you might have to parse the returned html and then format it how you want it
[15:55:48] <mike_f> As bad as it is to show the ugly guts underneath my application, it's even worse to show the ugly guts encoded.
[15:55:55] <MariusIT> grafi: can i move it up without using remove first? remove().insertAfter()? i don't want it to loose it's content http://jsfiddle.net/L9YCn/41/
[15:57:09] <guideX> http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=39514
[15:57:54] <eddiemonge> guideX: what is _arrayOfMedia ?
[15:58:09] <eddiemonge> also, is destinationDiv already in the dom when you start this loop?
[15:58:27] <guideX> yeah it is
[15:58:42] <guideX> I can append simple things, like "<div>hi!</div>"
[15:59:10] <guideX> _arrayOfMedia contains several parameters, date, title, description
[16:00:10] <eddiemonge> whats the format?
[16:00:18] <guideX> strings
[16:00:42] <eddiemonge> but i mean for the whole array
[16:00:52] <guideX> well it's an array..
[16:00:58] <guideX> I guess i'm missing your question
[16:01:09] <eddiemonge> is it like arrayOfMedia = [ $('a'), $('b') ]
[16:01:38] <guideX> hmm let me paste how that's created, 1 sec..
[16:03:22] <mike_f> I just tried using .html instead of .text, and that _appears_ to work ok for now.
[16:04:44] <eddiemonge> mike_f: $('#error_area').html().append( $(htmlErrorResponse).find('body') );
[16:04:50] <eddiemonge> mike_f: $('#error_area').html('').append( $(htmlErrorResponse).find('body') );
[16:05:53] <guideX> sorry for the delay, I do basically like var myvar = { 'title', mytitle: 'description': mydescription };  then add it to the array
[16:06:35] <guideX> via obj.push
[16:06:53] <eddiemonge> so then you are trying to append an object to a dom element?
[16:06:58] <guideX> yeah
[16:07:10] <eddiemonge> what are you expecting to happen?
[16:07:22] <guideX> in google chrome and other browsers it's rendered to html
[16:07:49] <guideX> to <div's and text and such
[16:08:17] <guideX> I have that all wrong huh
[16:09:31] <eddiemonge> yeah. i think the actual bug is in the other browsers
[16:09:45] <guideX> so I shouldn't be doing that
[16:09:58] <guideX> I should just construct the html 'manually' etc
[16:10:01] <eddiemonge> no. you need to create a dom element to append.
[16:10:10] <guideX> oic
[16:10:16] <eddiemonge> you could do .append('<div />', _myArray[1])
[16:10:25] <guideX> ohhh
[16:10:41] <eddiemonge> but ie might not like it still if you arent using valid html attributes as the property names
[16:12:02] <grafi> MariusIT http://jsfiddle.net/L9YCn/43/ this seems to work
[16:13:05] <guideX> hmm that didn't work
[16:13:17] <guideX> if I console.log, and then look at the object, there's like an innerhtml, an outerhtml with the fully rendered html
[16:13:40] <guideX> that's all the stuff I want appended..
[16:14:07] <eddiemonge> guideX: put what you want outputted in a fiddle and also whats going into the array, like all the properties
[16:14:21] <guideX> hmm ok
[16:14:43] <MariusIT> grafi: it works just fine
[16:14:50] <MariusIT> grafi: thank you!
[16:14:57] <guideX> here's the actual item http://www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=39515
[16:18:12] <eddiemonge> guideX: oh so it is a dom element
[16:18:33] <guideX> yeah
[16:18:56] <eddiemonge> then that append should work like you had it
[16:19:09] <guideX> hmm it works in most browsers, ie8 it doesn't
[16:19:15] <guideX> I  also tried appendTo
[16:19:33] <eddiemonge> what happens if you do alert instead of console.log in ie8?
[16:19:45] <guideX> it says [object, object]
[16:19:54] <guideX> also in console
[16:20:01] <guideX> but in chrome, console shows the item
[16:21:24] <eddiemonge> what does alert( $('div').first()[0] ) show?
[16:22:07] <guideX> hmm lemme check
[16:22:54] <guideX> obj.htmldivelement
[16:23:58] <guideX> if I do this in ie8, alert(this._arrayOfMedia[i][0].innerHTML);  I get different results than in google chrome
[16:24:10] <guideX> I get my divs, but they're all empty, in google chrome there's data
[16:24:10] <eddiemonge> give me the ie8 results, not chromes
[16:24:14] <guideX> hmm ok
[16:24:26] <eddiemonge> how is the array being populated again?
[16:24:58] <guideX>  var myvar = { 'title', mytitle: 'description': mydescription };   .. then .push
[16:25:20] <eddiemonge> i dont think thats the full case
[16:25:39] <eddiemonge> that wouldnt give the thing you pasted earlier
[16:26:15] <guideX> ah ok so there's more going on there... ok, I think I'll check that out, I think it's templating somewhere else
[16:26:25] <guideX> maybe it breaks somewhere at that point..
[16:26:49] <guideX> basically in ie8 innerhtml is this <DIV class=media_title></DIV><DIV class=media_dateCreated></DIV><DIV class=media_description></DIV>
[16:26:52] <eddiemonge> i think the object that is getting created isnt fully a dom element so ie is choking and everyone else is like whatev
[16:27:19] <guideX> ah ok
[16:30:30] <guideX> ok cool so in other words, i'm lookin gin the wrong place..
[16:31:06] <eddiemonge> probably
[16:31:41] <wagtag> Is it better to do $('li:first') or $('li').first() ?
[16:32:01] <wagtag> or does it not matter
[16:33:30] <BillCriswell> wagtag: I think the second is faster, but not by enough to worry about it.
[16:34:00] <wagtag> That's what I thought. Thanks BillCriswell
[16:34:30] <eddiemonge> i like the second one for numerous reasons
[16:41:35] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: Why?
[16:42:39] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: you could do things like .end() on it, it looks cleaner, its faster
[16:42:51] <blindMoe> seems like the second one would require jquery to grab all li's and the first one would know to just grab the first
[16:44:10] <BillCriswell> None of those reasons were as fun as I was hoping haha
[16:44:39] <BillCriswell> blindMoe: Good point. I just find the the second easier to read... probably why I'd use it.
[16:45:06] <blindMoe> BillCriswell: I tend to use .first() as well.. I like the look of chained commands ;)
[16:47:03] <BillCriswell> blindMoe: Agreed. As long as it's not too long.
[16:47:14] <BillCriswell> and lines are broken up logically.
[16:47:18] <blindMoe> the longer the better right ... wink wink
[16:47:38] <blindMoe> yeah definitely has to be broken up to look cooler
[16:48:31] <BillCriswell> haha
[16:54:20] <eddiemonge> blindMoe: the second is generally faster
[16:54:41] <blindMoe> eddiemonge: any particular reason?
[16:55:26] <eddiemonge> yeah but youd have to look at the source for reasons
[16:56:50] <eddiemonge> blindMoe: http://jsperf.com/first-vs-first-vs-eq-0
[16:57:02] <blindMoe> nice
[16:57:03] <eddiemonge> i think it has to do with how it passes it off to sizzle
[16:59:27] <shoky> with $('li').first() it'll just end up doing querySelectorAll
[17:00:46] <BillCriswell> would getElementsByTagName('li') be faster than querySelectorAll('li')?
[17:00:51] <wagtag> You would think that $('li:first') would be faster if it would stop at the first element found but it seems to still select all and then filter
[17:00:55] <BillCriswell> I always kind of assumed that's what it would fall back on.
[17:05:26] <BillCriswell> Ah, getElementsByTagName appears to be much faster.
[17:05:51] <shoky> yeah
[17:05:51] <BillCriswell> http://jsperf.com/queryselectorall-vs-getelementsbytagname
[17:06:29] <shoky> there's a link to an explanation in the comments
[17:06:37] <wagtag> nice
[17:06:43] <shoky> first time i notice there are jsperf comments
[17:06:44] <BillCriswell> Haha... besides Opera... Weird.]
[17:07:03] <wagtag> Not for long once Opera goes webkit
[17:19:29] <guideX> what do I use instead of Date.now() that will work in ie8?
[17:20:13] <blindMoe> guideX: http://afuchs.tumblr.com/post/23550124774/date-now-in-ie8
[17:20:37] <guideX> thx
[17:21:33] <BillCriswell> guideX: If you'll be doing a lot with dates I'd look into moment.js
[17:22:03] <guideX> hmm ok thx
[17:53:43] <guideX> is it just me or does video.js not fallback when ie8 is the browser
[17:54:17] <guideX> using the demo even it doesn't work
[17:56:58] <Emmayo> How to make tabs dynamically ???
[17:56:58] <tw2113> does it say it supports IE8 with fallback?
[17:58:03] <Emmayo> How to make tabs dynamically ???
[17:58:38] <guideX> doesn't say either way
[17:58:44] <guideX> I would think that's the point
[18:01:14] <BillCriswell> Emmayo: That question doesn't have enough details.
[18:02:23] <tw2113> a list could be treated as tabs with the right css
[18:02:31] <Emmayo> ??
[18:02:43] <Emmayo> ok
[18:10:51] <grafi> yaaaaawn
[18:11:41] <molavy> hi
[18:12:29] <kilra> ddos services needed, please msg me if interested
[18:12:31] <molavy> i want change value of checkbox silently , without firing change event
[18:13:27] <molavy> $("input:checked").removeAttr("checked")
[18:13:57] <molavy> this line fire change event
[18:14:10] <qkzoo1978> Hi.  I'm trying to create a page that dynamically changed the title in a header (jqm) but it's not displaying it at all.  My sample code: http://paste.debian.net/16468/  What I expect to happen is the page loads, then runs the pageLoad hook and updates the header bar, but it's not working.  Any feedback?
[18:14:37] <molavy> i like something like this : $("input:checked").removeAttr("checked",{"trigger":false})
[18:16:26] <prgCoder> hi guys - I am a little new to javascript - is there a nice way to view/debug javascript error messages ?  I have tried the consoles in Chrome and Firefox but things seem to appear and then disappear quickly. Any ideas?
[18:17:12] <molavy> qkzoo1978 , $("head title").text("new title")
[18:17:23] <cusco> hey folks...
[18:17:41] <cusco> I have a .animate() running with about 30 seconds length ...
[18:17:50] <cusco> can I stop it before it finishes?
[18:19:08] <qkzoo1978> molavy: isn't that what I did $("#pageTitle").text(newTitleVariable);
[18:19:11] <cusco> prgCoder: what do you mean appear and disappear? are tou changing page?
[18:19:36] <molavy> cusco,http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[18:19:47] <cusco> thanks molavy
[18:20:54] <prgCoder> cusco: I think it is when I am trying to show a loading gif between pages being rendered.
[18:21:22] <cusco> console moves away to the new page bewing rendered ..
[18:21:27] <cusco> cancel the redirect ...
[18:21:46] <cusco> or use return false; just after the instruction you're trying to debug
[18:21:51] <cusco> or just after console.log()
[18:22:31] <prgCoder> cusco: thanks - I will try that
[18:23:50] <xylogicz> need help
[18:24:50] <RRR2> good
[18:37:58] <aladdinwang> hi all
[18:38:12] <guideX> wow firedebug lite :D
[18:38:21] <aladdinwang> are there any jquery ui looks like this? http://img30.360buyimg.com/pophelp/g9/M03/12/07/rBEHalDs6cAIAAAAAAD5T0C6ZnkAADkGwKcyq4AAPln242.jpg
[18:38:55] <aladdinwang> I need sort a group of images, delete/replace some one, reorder the images
[18:39:33] <tw2113> for chrome guideX ?
[18:39:53] <guideX> I'm using it in ie8
[18:40:05] <guideX> I use chrome mainly, but today have been dealing with all ie8 issues
[18:40:30] <tw2113> ah
[18:40:41] <tw2113> didn't realize you could get a firebug lite for IE anything
[18:41:07] <guideX> it's cool, it's a script which you put on whatever page
[18:41:12] <guideX> and it loads into whatever browser
[18:41:44] <guideX> it's giving me most of the firefox inspectors features :D
[18:41:52] <guideX> actually more like firebug
[18:43:47] <guideX> debugging in ie8 is a nightmare.. but this makes it a breeze
[18:53:46] <X-Rob> I appear to have some sort of fundimental mis-understanding with Javascript. I have a function that does this: $("#Timeout>div.Name>a>span.Name").replaceWith($("<span>").addClass("Name").text(timeoutText));  -- if I call it from jQuery, it doesn't work (in fact, trying to get html() on it results in null). If I do it from the chrome console, it works.
[18:54:18] <X-Rob> Is this some sort of sandboxing I don't understand?
[19:00:15] <tab1293> Is there anyway for an HTML element like a table column to display jquery data set by $.data() and constantly be updated
[19:04:18] <velcrow> Is Jquery mobile a good choice to make my website responsive?
[19:04:40] <velcrow> Or is it mainly intended for mobile apps/complete mobile versions of websites.
[19:05:19] <velcrow> I basically want to make a version of my website which looks good on desktops and large tablets, and one version which looks good on smartphones.
[19:15:16] <juarezpaf> Hey everyone! How is going? I am trying to make OAuth 1 request with jQuery, but I had no success until now. Someone could gimme a hand on it please?
[19:15:29] <LLckfan> Hello juarezpaf
[19:15:47] <zeusbebe> hola
[19:16:16] <zeusbebe> algien de madrid
[19:17:21] <juarezpaf> Hey guys! I am going crazy here with this OAuth thing!
[19:19:05] <shoky> X-Rob: are you waiting for the DOM to be ready before calling it?
[19:20:20] <X-Rob> shoky, it's happening multiple times, event driven. DOM is most certainly ready.
[19:20:43] <shoky> X-Rob: then make a jsfiddle/demo
[19:20:54] <X-Rob> shoky, it's part of a Roller Derby Scoreboard.
[19:21:00] <X-Rob> and it's.. amazingly complex.
[19:21:01] <X-Rob> *sigh*
[19:21:11] <X-Rob> I just want to change one word on an event.
[19:21:21] <shoky> if it's a "fundamental mis-understanding of javascript" i'm sure you can make a minimal testcase
[19:21:33] <shoky> can't help you without seeing what you're doing
[19:21:41] <X-Rob> shoky, fair enough.
[19:21:59] <X-Rob> So it appears there's no magic sandboxing or something happening between console (works) and event (doesn't)
[19:22:18] <X-Rob> Possibly some caching or something? They're all generated objects.
[19:22:39] <shoky> nah
[19:24:13] <shoky> are you sure the element exists in the DOM when you're calling that?
[19:24:23] <shoky> console.log the selection result
[19:24:43] <X-Rob> shoky, I get length:0 when I do console.log($("#...")).
[19:24:53] <X-Rob> But I can call the function from console, and it works
[19:24:56] <shoky> that would explain why nothing happens
[19:25:05] <shoky> so? it's at different times
[19:25:08] <X-Rob> then try to do it programatically, and it doesn't (back to length 0)
[19:25:24] <shoky> your code is adding/removing elements
[19:25:46] <X-Rob> ... True.
[19:25:54] <X-Rob> I just replaced what was already there
[19:26:05] <shoky> not that line you pasted, i mean your other code
[19:26:06] * X-Rob wanders off to try it his own way, rather than copying code he doesn't udnerstand
[19:26:24] <X-Rob> well. I understand it. I just don't know WHY it's done that way
[19:26:35] * shoky shrugs
[19:28:59] <X-Rob> shoky, changing the text with .html() works. Sigh. Sorry for wasting your time. Thanks.
[19:29:36] <shoky> np
[19:30:45] <WG1337> Hi! Im using fancybox with iframe to make a file upload. Why doesn't autoscale work when I use 'type' : 'iframe' ? If I don't use it, then when I press Submit, I get redirected. With 'iframe' type I still stay in fancybox (like I need)
[19:53:13] <juarezpaf> Come on guys! Anybody with OAuth knowledge?
[20:01:09] <juarezpaf> I found this OAuth 1.0 implementation https://github.com/osmlab/ohauth but I had no success using it.
[20:27:51] <vedz> hey guys
[20:28:38] <LLckfan> Is there a way to stop Shockwave Flash from crashing in Chrome? I have this happen on two different computer(different os and brands)
[20:36:49] <vedz> http://kadesign.com.au/presidential.html guys have a look at this why doesnt my gallary work
[20:36:59] <vedz> it used to work fine then just stopped
[20:37:46] <vedz> any ideas guys
[20:38:01] <juarezpaf> Ah ha! I think I found a solution for my OAuth problems!
[20:38:50] <juarezpaf> @vedz how are you there?
[20:39:27] <juarezpaf> vedz take a look into this url http://kadesign.com.au/js/jquery.min.js It is not loading the jquery.min.js
[20:43:16] <vedz> juarezpaf hey yes
[20:43:22] <vedz> i fixed that still no luck
[20:43:40] <vedz> i need jquery.js to work cause that is the gallery
[20:44:40] <vedz> jquery-lightbox-0.5
[20:44:56] <vedz> when i firsted added it work no problem
[20:44:59] <vedz> then just stoped
[20:48:18] <vedz> anyone with a solution for me
[21:07:31] <nesoi1> how do I get rid of the flicker when switching screens in JQM?
[21:09:41] <Pavlov> i stopped using jqm today and that fixed it :
[21:09:43] <Pavlov> :/
[21:10:56] <nesoi1> heh
[21:11:01] <nesoi1> what are you using instead Pavlov?
[21:11:07] <vedz> hello anyone good jquery
[21:11:10] <vedz> http://kadesign.com.au/presidential.html
[21:11:16] <vedz> my gallery does not work
[21:11:34] <WG1337> Anyone knows why Plupload HTML4 runtime doesn't seem to show that file is uploaded?
[21:11:37] <nesoi1> oh, I just fixed it!
[21:11:42] <nesoi1> user-scalable=no
[21:14:14] <nesoi1> Pavlov:  I put user-scalable=no in the viewport statement and it stopped flickering
[21:19:06] <nesoi1> ok, next issue. resuming the app when it hasn't been unloaded shows a blank screen, but as soon as I touch it it updates‚Ä¶ how do I get it to update without a touch?
[21:23:14] <Pavlov> nesoi1: i was already using knockout -- i switched to using knockout+pagerjs + a lot of custom css
[21:26:25] <nesoi1> Pavlov:  this is for mobile web or hybrid apps?
[21:27:42] <Pavlov> phonegap/mostly web-under-the-hood
[21:28:09] <heshanh> with jqmobile is there a way to setup multiple buttons to select, so when a button is touched they stay selected and user can select many buttons
[21:28:48] <nesoi1> Pavlov:  are you finding it to be much better performance than jqm?
[21:47:12] <juarezpaf> vedz you need to put a *data-lightbox* attribute in images to gallery work properly... Try to follow the documentation in http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/
[21:48:43] <epicowl> anyone familiar with chosen library? I am getting this http://i.imgur.com/WEXrqFh.png
[21:48:53] <epicowl> it's not removing selected items from the dropdown
[21:49:22] <vedz> juarezpaf thanks mate should i use light box too
[21:52:28] <juarezpaf> vedz nowadays I am using http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/ Enjoy it! B-)
[21:53:20] <vedz> cool thanks again man
[21:55:42] <juarezpaf> epicowl there is no error in your chosen implementation, *chosen* make all pre-selected elements disabled with a grey color. If you look into your screenshot *Animals / Big Cats / Tigers* is disabled, which is different from *Animals / Tigers / Bengal Tiger*
[21:56:40] <epicowl> juarezpaf: ah ok that explains the grey‚Ä¶ Im implementing an ajax form using ajax-chosen...
[21:57:01] <juarezpaf> Happy code mate! B-)
[21:57:08] <epicowl> for some reason it worked when I imported chosen through a different library (python) but when I use chosen.js directly it doesn't work
[22:15:04] <hoppipolla> hello
[22:15:44] <hoppipolla> on the browser compatibility page, http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/ when it says 'Apple iOS' is it referring to safari?
[22:18:58] <heshanh> with jqmobile is there a way to setup multiple buttons to select, so when a button is touched they stay selected and user can select more
[22:31:59] <SirFunk_> If i am binding a click to an element but i need it to fire after other clicks on that element. is there a way to do this?
[22:47:54] <nate_> hi
[22:48:12] <nate_> ... :(
[22:49:00] <xylogicz> hey nathan
[22:49:14] <nate_> hello
[22:49:27] <nate_> Are you THE xylogicz???
[22:49:47] <xylogicz> Yeah the legendary programmer
[22:49:50] <xylogicz> so youve heard of me
[22:49:56] <nate_> Oh of course
[22:50:17] <nate_> You're the guy that selected the impossible to select element
[22:50:25] <xylogicz> yes
[22:50:27] <xylogicz> that is me
[22:50:41] <nate_> =)
[22:51:51] <xylogicz> So is anyone else around right now
[22:52:14] <nate_> just me unfortunately
[23:12:26] <juarezpaf> Guys! My problem with OAuth was a server side thing... I did to update some parameters.
[23:37:08] <HardDisk_WP> hey
[23:37:23] <HardDisk_WP> i'm building a rss feedreader with javascript/jquery
[23:38:11] <HardDisk_WP> but i'm sick of writing var e=$("<div></div>").INSERT_LONG_TAIL_HERE
[23:38:34] <HardDisk_WP> especially when it's 15 or so of these in a row
[23:38:43] <HardDisk_WP> any way to "properly" do this?
[23:39:14] <Cork> what do you mean by properly?
[23:39:36] <Cork> btw you most likely want to do $("<div>") not $("<div></div>")
[23:39:50] <Cork> jquery has optimized code for the first one
[23:41:16] <HardDisk_WP> Ah, cool, thanks for this one. Well, in php-generated server side code, I can do ?><div><span class="foo">$bar</span><span class="baz" id="qqq>fff</span></div><?
[23:42:26] <HardDisk_WP> whilst with jquery I have to do var d=$("<div>");var s=$("<span>").addClass("foo").appendTo(d);var s2=$("<span>").addClass("bar").attr("id","fff").appendTo(d);
[23:42:39] <HardDisk_WP> I'd like to avoid that boilerplate stuff
[23:44:47] <JohnnyCache> anyone here uses brute-select plugin?
[23:49:40] <Cork> ?g jquery jqote2 @ HardDisk_WP
[23:49:41] <b-ot> HardDisk_WP: Sorry, no results for ‚Äüjquery jqote2 @ HardDisk_WP‚Äù.
[23:49:43] <bot-t> HardDisk_WP, jQote2 ñ Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code - http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[23:49:55] <Cork> HardDisk_WP: that is prob what you want
[23:50:15] <HardDisk_WP> Indeed, thank you!
[23:50:32] <HardDisk_WP> Lol, that guy comes from the same town as me. Might want to buy him a beer in person :D
