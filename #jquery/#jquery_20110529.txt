[02:04:02] <Tant102> The source for /node does not reference that file anywhere.
[02:04:17] <jbreezy> ok
[02:04:19] <jbreezy> hmm

[02:26:24] <Hornet-> for the slider widget, is there a way to specify points to snap to, rather than the automatic range?
[02:26:36] <rethus> can someone tell my, why in the console-log-array the second calue of the array contains "parm, value" even if i did split?
[02:26:36] <Hornet-> say I want 1, 4, 10 rather than 1,2,3,etc,10
[02:27:46] <rethus> found it.
[02:34:29] <rethus> anyone knows a realy good regexp checking online tool?
[02:35:47] <Kambfhase> console?
[02:36:05] <sbound_> what's the best way to load images? sprites, base64 or xml/ajax?
[02:37:33] <Kambfhase> sbound_: sprites, ie normal <img> get cached. plus they have no overhead
[02:38:13] <sbound_> true but so does base64 through the css and gets compressed rather well
[02:38:58] <sbound_> the only thing I don't like about using base64 would be the minor changes made to the css bundle
[02:39:08] <sbound_> bye bye cache
[02:39:42] <sbound_> someone mentioned loading images using ajax through an xml file but don't know?

[02:47:53] <satfree> i have json query like this : {"product": {   "prodId": 2,   "prodBarcode": "010003602"}}  ...i'd like to display prodBarcode using    console.log(data.product.prodBarcode) , but it said undefined. pls help
[02:49:59] <satfree> any help pls....
[02:50:41] <djQuery>  then try console.log(data); first and see what u get
[02:52:15] <satfree> @djQuery : it display  json format : {"product": { "prodId": 2, "prodBarcode": "010003602"}}
[02:53:11] <djQuery> so now work your way up data.product
[02:53:32] <nail_> $.parseJSON() it
[02:55:45] <satfree> @dJquery : data.product: undefined
[02:56:47] <nail_> because it's a string
[02:57:34] <satfree> @nail : hmm..can you give me some example on my case>
[02:57:48] <nail_> data = $.parseJSON(data);
[02:59:05] <satfree> cool...now i have data.product: [object Object]

[03:00:38] <satfree> i got solution as your suggestion.
[03:05:03] <Rintintin> Hi. I've put the custom attribute 'data-page' on some elements. Say it contains the string "a.html".
[03:05:15] <Rintintin> if I do 'var page = ($this).attr("data-page"); '$('#dynamic').load(page);' it won't work, nothing will happen
[03:05:37] <Rintintin> even though 'alert(page)' shows that it IS "a.html" If I instead type ''$('#dynamic').load("a.html");'  it will work.
[03:06:04] <djQuery> Rintintin: ?see .data
[03:06:31] <djQuery> Rintintin: see ?.data
[03:06:31] <bot-t> Rintintin, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[03:07:53] <djQuery> $('#dynamic').load($(this).data('page')); should work fine.
[03:10:17] <mipo> shemy: how are you?
[03:10:49] <Rintintin> hmm the .data article only shows how to use data that's set via script. Can it be set via html markup as well?
[03:11:04] <djQuery> Rintintin: yes
[03:15:40] <Lunders> http://jsfiddle.net/kJCKF/ - anyone know what I could use instead of using "	$("form").submit();" as this is causing me to go into a loop ...
[03:16:44] <ravenzz> $(this).submit()
[03:16:45] <ravenzz> ?
[03:17:18] <ravenzz> btw you should prevent the submit
[03:17:31] <ravenzz> when you handle it
[03:17:44] <ravenzz> $("form").submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); ...
[03:18:51] <ravenzz> btw there are some plugins that do the client-side validation
[03:19:22] <Rintintin> djQuery: how? In my markup I've set 'data-page="contact.hmtl" ' is that correct? I've got a click method with 'alert(jQuery.data( $(this), 'data-page' ));' and the alert says 'undefined'.. and yes, I've checked that the this object is the right one.
[03:19:24] <Lunders> im just confused with it :(
[03:19:49] <ravenzz> Lunders http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[03:20:55] <ravenzz> then you should perform a server-side validation
[03:22:29] <Lunders> Yeah iv got that in the next part :) thanks for your help
[03:41:13] <guy> I've seen very similar plugin to this, but it had cooler shuffling effect. http://webstuffshare.com/demo/FilterImages/ anyone has an idea what could it be?
[03:44:34] <guy> anyone?
[03:44:40] <sean`> guy I know which one you mean
[03:44:55] <guy> it was on a black background and kinda colorful.
[03:45:06] <sean`> a blue blackground
[03:45:20] <guy> maybe
[03:48:40] <guy> sean`: do you have any idea what is the name of the plugin? : )
[03:48:59] <guy> "jquery category filter" google doesn't bring it up in first 30 results.
[03:49:45] <Spockz> can I do a revert of the sort once I've received the update event on sortable?
[03:50:45] <sean`> no guy
[03:50:51] <sean`> I would've mentioned
[03:54:00] <guy> I think it might be this plugin http://razorjack.net/quicksand/
[03:54:13] <guy> though, this is updated version. anyway, it does the same, as far as I can remember.
[03:55:50] <guy> @sean` in case you would need it ^ quicksand
[03:56:40] <sean`> guy, YES
[03:56:48] <sean`> that's the one I was talking about
[03:59:20] <Spockz> guy, do you know how to revert a sort once you get the update event?
[03:59:47] <guy> using .. ?
[03:59:53] <Spockz> should $(this).sortable('cancel') work there too?
[04:00:00] <sean`> Spockz, why not use the 'revert?
[04:00:02] <Spockz> ah the Sortable from Jquery ui
[04:00:52] <Spockz> sean`: Whether the sort succeeds or not depends from what the server replies
[04:01:52] <Spockz> but I need it's updated DOM position on the server before I can decide on whether it is allowed or not
[04:02:40] <qknight> do i need css stuff to make http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1770835/solved-hide-li-from-a-list <- work? i tried a lot of different things but it won't hide any LI
[04:03:02] <qknight> maybe someone has a minimal example for that (i'm new to jquery but it seems fascinating)
[04:03:36] <Spockz> ah right
[04:04:17] <Spockz> sean`, guy: the problem was that I passed $(this).sortable('cancel') as a function to the event handler of my AJAX call, so this was different this there :)
[04:04:22] <Spockz> fixed it :)
[04:10:51] <qknight> got it
[04:14:51] <qknight> how to address a single element within a dom-tree (or a set of similar objects, say all with class=foo)?
[04:16:47] <sean`> Spockz, you need to create that behavior yourself
[04:17:09] <rethus> how to search in regexpr only for the first : not for all ?
[04:17:49] <bittyx-laptop> qknight: if i understand what you're asking, look up selectors.
[04:18:10] <bittyx-laptop> qknight: e.g. to hide all elements with class foo, you'd do something like $('.foo').hide();
[04:18:25] <sean`> rethus, why use regex for that, not indexOf?
[04:18:54] <mh__> hi.. im looking for a way to make a live updated list of table entries.. but the problem is, if i want this list.. somehow i have to make sure i dont already has listed the database source that i get back.. does somebody have any suggestions?
[04:19:11] <rethus> seanÂ´ cause of using split
[04:19:55] <rethus> if i have a value like "hour: 12:22:11", i only want to split between hour and the first digit
[04:20:07] <qknight> bittyx-laptop: thanks very much!
[04:20:23] <bittyx-laptop> mh__: list the items by any index that makes sense (e.g. alphabetically, chronologically, whatever), and fetch them from the database some fixed number of entries at a time
[04:21:10] <bittyx-laptop> mh__: or, say, if they're just text, you can put them in, e.g. <p> tags, and insert something like id="..", so you'd have <p id="1">some item</p> .....
[04:21:20] <bittyx-laptop> mh__: then you can always check whether an item already exists
[04:21:31] <sean`> ?eval foo = 'hour: 12:22:11'; foo.substr (foo.indexOf (':') + 2)
[04:21:32] <bot-t> sean`: "12:22:11"
[04:21:34] <sean`> rethus,
[04:21:43] <mh__> bittyx-laptop: hmm, yes if i give them an id.. i can just fetch everything above the latest number.. thanks
[04:21:45] <Spockz> sean`: I already fixed it
[04:21:52] <bittyx-laptop> mh__: but a better way, logically, would be to set it up so you don't redownload the same itesm
[04:21:53] <qknight> bittyx-laptop: yes works great! many thanks!
[04:21:59] <bittyx-laptop> mh__: usually that's done with pagination
[04:22:28] <mh__> bittyx-laptop: yes.. i would like just to pop an new entry in top of the table when a new item appears..
[04:22:33] <Spockz> sean`: it wasn't working before because "this" was read from a different context (namely the ajax handler and not from sortable)
[04:22:33] <rethus> sean+, k, thanks for this hint
[04:22:38] <bittyx-laptop> mh__: so your original request (that serves the page or whatever) could end with "LIMIT 0, 10" (of you want 10 items starting from item 0), the next request would be "LIMIT 10, 10", the nexta one "LIMIT 20, 10", etc.
[04:23:09] <bittyx-laptop> mh__: or, if you want to optimize the database part, you'd do "...WHERE `item_id` > $last_item_id..."
[04:23:09] <mh__> bittyx-laptop: yes.. i can see that would be pretty smart, but for this case i will not need pagination.. at least for now :)
[04:23:38] <bittyx-laptop> mh__: and you'd keep $last_item_id stored somewhere, either on the page, or in the javascript, or whatever suits your needs
[04:23:40] <mh__> bittyx-laptop: yes.. thats the way i will go.. just get the latest id and fetch everything above that.. and $.each on the return
[04:24:31] <bittyx-laptop> qknight: you're welcome
[04:24:33] <bittyx-laptop> mh__: good luck.
[04:24:54] <mh__> thanks
[04:30:50] <ShawnRisk> I have a slider and when I hover over this the slider appears.  The problem is when I move off the slider sometimes, the slider will be stuck there.  Any ideas why?
[04:39:30] <guy> Andy-: was I talking with you about Quicksand?
[04:40:52] <guy> ah. no sean`
[04:41:07] <guy> @sean` any idea why the plugin is acting like a shit? http://guy.lt/kamildymek/
[04:41:51] <guy> ah, you know. forget it.
[04:43:11] <sean`> perhaps you're not using correct markup ?
[04:43:14] <sean`> I like the page btw
[04:48:10] <guy> Thank you
[04:49:52] <Spockz> how can I see the difference between a close from the X in a dialog or a custom fired event?
[04:53:25] <sean`> Spockz, you can send data along with the event
[04:53:27] <sean`> and see if that's set
[04:54:20] <Spockz> sean`: I found this: http://jsbin.com/obafo/edit
[04:55:15] <dabear> Spockz: if you need this, your are doing something wrong(tm)
[04:56:03] <Spockz> dabear: what's 'this'?
[04:56:13] <dabear> ?
[04:56:31] <Spockz> I want to differentiate between a cancel and a successful close
[04:56:32] <dabear> you should never have to worry about if the event is triggered or fired naturally
[04:56:44] <Spockz> dabear: right, not that difference
[04:56:59] <Spockz> I want to know by what the event was triggered
[04:57:14] <Spockz> as there is only one close event
[04:57:56] <ssfsam> what is client side templeting means
[04:57:58] <dabear> why is that needed?
[04:58:41] <Spockz> dabear: because I have a form in the dialog, if the save of that data succeeds (IE validates by server) it should close the dialog and update the info in a sortable item
[04:58:49] <Spockz> if not it should remove the sortable item
[05:00:01] <dabear> Spockz: when the validation succeeds, .trigger("dialogclose") and then update the contents
[05:00:38] <Spockz> dabear: and how then to delete when the cross is clicked?
[05:00:41] <dabear> you shouldn't have to update the contents inside the event listener for dialogclose, but on the data validation success
[05:01:25] <Spockz> dabear: that's what I do now
[05:01:44] <dabear> if closing a dialog means removing contents, you have a usability issue
[05:01:58] <Spockz> dabear: why, it's cancel
[05:02:02] <dabear> in other words, that not a behaviour a user expects
[05:02:11] <ShawnRisk> I have a slider and when I hover over this the slider appears. Â The problem is when I move the mouse cursor off the slider sometimes, the slider will be stuck there. Â Any ideas why?
[05:03:16] <biz> hi, is there a way to make <select> work within an overlay div which is shown own hover only? Somehow one can open the select menu, but when leaving the first option it closes immediately (depends on browser, tested with FF3.6): http://jsfiddle.net/4dSMw/
[05:03:16] <dabear> Spockz: if you have two buttons on the dialog, listen to the click of the buttons instead
[05:03:31] <dabear> but cancel is not the same as delete imho
[05:04:03] <Spockz> dabear: you get the dialog on an "Add" action
[05:06:06] <dabear> Spockz: name the button delete contents, add a click listener on that button and make sure a click actually deletes contents
[05:06:43] <Spockz> dabear: but if you cancel adding an item... you don't expect to keep that item right?
[05:07:02] <dabear> correct
[05:07:32] <dabear> if that's the case, you didn't explain your self that way
[05:07:33] <Spockz> dabear: so that's why I have to delete the dummy item from the sortable lsit
[05:07:50] <dabear> what's the problem
[05:08:08] <dabear> use the click handlers on the buttons
[05:08:51] <Spockz> Hmm, I could, but then I should remove the save button from the form I get from the ajax request (or not put it in there in the first place)
[05:12:08] <Spockz> dabear: another issue, my UI is to be multi-lingual, I haven't yet found a nice way to translate my UI
[05:12:10] <eax> Hi there, I'm having a problem with a page that, through jQuery-Ajax loads another page and places this second page in a div box. However, the second page contains some jQuery code that is never run after being loaded through jQuery-ajax. If I load the page on its own, no problem. What am I doing wrong?
[05:12:14] <Spockz> for the JS parts then
[05:12:58] <dabear> eax: have all your javascript in the original page, and then just use ajax to load html contents
[05:13:04] <dabear> that's the best solution
[05:13:26] <dabear> Spockz: sorry, no idea, maybe gettext, but haven't used it much
[05:16:11] <Spockz> dabear: but even if I have buttons, people still can click on the X in the top of the dialog
[05:16:49] <dabear> you can either remove the x in the top, or attach the same listener for the delete button and the close button
[05:17:05] <dabear> the dialogclose event, I meant to say
[05:17:19] <guy> should I somehow indicate (with a picture, text or whatsoever) that the black bar on the right actually triggers navigation to another page or is it better to keep it this way? http://guy.lt/kamildymek/ assuming people interested to find contact details about the person will likely discover it eventually.
[05:17:30] <Spockz> dabear: now I've lost you
[05:17:51] <Spockz> dabear: do you say to switch the function behind the event in case you click on Save?
[05:17:57] <eax> dabear: Hm, that might require a major rewrite, but thanks a lot! :)
[05:19:44] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts on my question?
[05:23:36] <dabear> Spockz:  in essence, something like this: function myhandler(){ do something here} $yourdialog.bind("dialogclose", myhandler); $deleteButton.click(myhandler)
[05:24:19] <sunscreen> i have a jquery <div> popup thing that used to work on my phones browser but now it fails any ideas what could of stopped it working
[05:25:04] <dabear> sunscreen: nope
[05:25:18] <dabear> sunscreen: need to see some code, see ?p
[05:25:18] <bot-t> sunscreen, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[05:25:23] <sunscreen> only thing i can think that did actually changed was before I was calling my script from local ver 1.5 now it is from googles site and its ver 1.2
[05:25:43] <Jayflux> if its from google's it will be 1.6.1
[05:25:50] <dabear> sunscreen: jquery 1.2? that is ooold. don't use it
[05:26:00] <Jayflux> unless you've specified the version you want, in which case 1.2 is very old
[05:26:45] <sunscreen> yea i only changed it to that because i was debuing something else and borrowed some one else's obviously older code to be sure the problem was not a difference between newer jquery
[05:27:08] <Jayflux> you shouldnt really be using 1.2, try a later version
[05:27:50] <sunscreen> k
[05:28:24] <sunscreen> if reverting to newer jquery fails i'll link for you
[05:28:42] <Spockz> dabear: any idea how I can diable the X in top of the dialog?
[05:28:58] <Whirl3d> I am not sure how to ask this question exactly. Is there a way to scope a function for a dom element? In other words, I want to call the same function on the "current" div and have it behave differently for each div...is that possible?
[05:29:28] * sunscreen gets script code from jsfiddle
[05:29:47] <Jayflux> Whirl3d are you thinking of $(this) ?
[05:30:08] <dabear> Spockz: $(".ui-dialog-titlebar-close").remove() ?
[05:30:27] <Spockz> dabear: *blink* ofc..
[05:30:36] <Whirl3d> Jayflux, thanks for the reply...What i am trying to do is a custom pagination thing where each page is responsible for its own method of pagination
[05:31:20] <Whirl3d> so, if it scrolls content you send the function (showTopic(x) to the current page and it scrolls, or jumps, or ...
[05:31:47] <dabear> Whirl3d: sense, you aren't making any
[05:32:09] <Whirl3d> You have scrolling content for one page (which you are loading through ajax)
[05:32:19] <Whirl3d> But you have a thumbnail index for the next page (same ajax)
[05:32:51] <Whirl3d> One command should be able to get you to the same  "topic" (scrolling by one page, and clicking on a thumb by the other)
[05:33:44] <Whirl3d> So, if you come along with a horizontal scrolling page that contains 5 elements you might scroll to, it will work because you send it one command. Show item 5
[05:33:55] <Whirl3d> and the page figures out how to get to item 5
[05:36:51] <Whirl3d> I figure I can store the pagination scripts in the data objects for each "page" and reference it that way, but I was hoping someone had a better way to do it
[05:38:00] <ShawnRisk> Jayflux: hi
[05:38:09] <Whirl3d> for example, I use a standard tween format for the majority of my content. But when selecting the animation properties, it checks the elements data object for custom animation parameters and uses them if they are available
[05:42:23] <m0dmd-> Whirl3d
[05:42:26] <m0dmd-> what's going on bud
[05:42:33] <m0dmd-> gotta run but talk to ya lata

[05:44:47] <Draconisle> Hi Guys
[05:45:13] <Draconisle> Anyone awake yet?
[05:46:28] <Whirl3d> <--always awake
[05:46:33] <Draconisle> nice
[05:46:38] <sunscreen> hmmm
[05:46:45] <sunscreen> damnd cell network
[05:46:50] <Whirl3d> <--not always coherent, mind you
[05:47:04] <Draconisle> Anyone know if I can connect to a SQL db from a javascript/jquery?
[05:47:14] <Draconisle> I would like to avoid ASP.net and PHP
[05:47:44] <Spockz> Draconisle: well, go with Ruby then :)
[05:48:01] <Draconisle> so I need server-side scripting?
[05:48:11] <Whirl3d> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/SQL_QUERY_BUILDER
[05:48:19] <Spockz> Draconisle: well you need some way to talk to the database, yes
[05:49:56] <Draconisle> looks like that plugin is for select/read/
[05:50:00] <Draconisle> looks like that plugin is for select/read?
[05:50:26] <Draconisle> will ASP.NET work on IPADs?
[05:50:29] <Draconisle> do you guys know?
[05:50:45] <Spockz> Draconisle: what do you mean, as a server?
[05:51:05] <Spockz> Draconisle: what is your intended usage?
[05:51:28] <Draconisle> a portal-type intranet site for the widest audience
[05:51:44] <Draconisle> its for a corporate environment so I have to make sure I dont embarass myself
[05:52:09] <Draconisle> I kept raving about jQuery and never actually thought about how I was gonna connect to my SQL DB
[05:52:41] <Draconisle> I was thinking about ASP.net at first but then thought that would prevent my iPAD users from accessing the site
[05:53:03] <Draconisle> so I wanted to get back to basics with just html extensions and javascript/jquery code
[05:55:40] <Draconisle> anyone know if ASP.NET will indeed limit my users?
[05:55:56] <Draconisle> I dont have an iPAD so I cant really test myself
[05:58:50] <Draconisle> Spockz? Whirl3d?
[05:59:21] <stackoverflow> hello
[05:59:37] <Draconisle> hello
[05:59:58] <Spockz> Draconisle: well, what's the problem with having a serveR?
[06:00:20] <Draconisle> I am very new to web development so I am not well-versed with the tech yet
[06:00:38] <Draconisle> if I make an asp.net site, that wont limit my users right?  since it is server side scripting?
[06:01:20] <stackoverflow> yup
[06:01:34] <Draconisle> great
[06:01:46] <Draconisle> then that should let me do the SQL writes with no problems
[06:01:59] <Spockz> Draconisle: I applaud you for your enthusiams, to make an enterprise-level intranet :)
[06:02:45] <Draconisle> well I am trying to replace implemented sites that are not consolidated, which is highly impacting our productivity and workflow
[06:03:03] <ShawnRisk> seems no one can help me :(
[06:03:05] <Draconisle> since I am not approved for Sharepoint Server, I have to make do with brains rather than wallet
[06:03:18] <Spockz> ShawnRisk:?
[06:03:35] <ShawnRisk> I have a slider and when I hover over this the slider appears. Â The problem is when I move the mouse cursor off the slider sometimes, the slider will be stuck there. Â Any ideas why?
[06:04:02] <Draconisle> what browser are you using to test?
[06:04:35] <Draconisle> I am not sure but maybe paste the code in jsfiddle.net
[06:05:18] <ShawnRisk> Draconisle: I am testing on Safari and Firefox
[06:05:33] <Draconisle> code snippet?
[06:05:47] <ShawnRisk> ecosanity.org
[06:06:04] <ShawnRisk> if you just want the code I can paste that
[06:06:09] <sunscreen> http://selectuk.netii.net/ can some one tell me if the listen live button popup works on mobile *UMTS here being a pain*
[06:06:39] <Draconisle> how do I trigger the slider
[06:06:44] <beeeviz> guys
[06:07:00] <ShawnRisk> Draconisle: just hover over the slideshow
[06:07:02] <beeeviz> is there a way to find out how often one of my plugins has been downloaded from plugins.jquery.com?
[06:07:27] <Draconisle> oh you're right
[06:07:38] <Draconisle> i have chrome
[06:07:53] <Draconisle> brb
[06:11:27] <Draconisle> hey Spockz
[06:11:36] <Spockz> yes
[06:11:52] <Draconisle> Can you look at ecosanity.org
[06:12:13] <Draconisle> I am trying to look at ShawnRisk's site and the hover isnt working properly
[06:12:15] <Spockz> it loaded
[06:12:27] <Draconisle> it doesnt disappear properly
[06:12:44] <Spockz> the slider in the carroussel thingy?
[06:13:03] <ShawnRisk> Draconisle: thanks.
[06:13:14] <Draconisle> yeah
[06:13:20] <Draconisle> it is dependent on the image
[06:13:29] <Draconisle> it looks like its context sensitive
[06:13:34] <Spockz> it only disappears when you leave the carrousel through the slide
[06:14:04] <Draconisle> sometimes even that doesnt work
[06:14:22] <Draconisle> I have to do it several times
[06:14:50] <Draconisle> just go up and down several times
[06:14:53] <Spockz> works perfectly here
[06:15:17] <Draconisle> strange
[06:15:33] <ShawnRisk> Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
[06:15:54] <Draconisle> if I scroll into the image, the carousel shows, and then keep scrolling into the image and then scroll directly down outside of the img area
[06:15:55] <ShawnRisk> brb
[06:16:42] <Draconisle> do it quickly, up and down (same vertical line), in and out going past the carousel each time, and it will be buggy
[06:20:10] <sunscreen> http://selectuk.netii.net/ popup fails to work
[06:20:15] <sunscreen> on mobile
[06:20:23] <sunscreen> used to work on bb os6 webkit browser
[06:21:01] <sunscreen> and i am using jquery 1.5 api now
[06:21:48] <dabear> sunscreen: the scripts have the wrong mime type
[06:21:55] <beeeviz> is there a way to find out how often one of my plugins has been downloaded from plugins.jquery.com?
[06:22:09] <dabear> text/html and text/plain instead of text/javascript
[06:22:47] <ShawnRisk> back
[06:23:13] <Draconisle> not sure if it matters
[06:23:20] <Draconisle> but the duration for fast is 200
[06:23:32] <Draconisle> i dont think it matters though
[06:24:48] <sunscreen> hmm
[06:25:05] <sunscreen> text/html would not make sense cause its not html ?
[06:25:30] <sunscreen> text/plain resulted in no loading in desktop browser
[06:26:00] <dabear> sunscreen: https://skitch.com/bjorninge/fb6jb/the-radio-station
[06:29:39] <ShawnRisk> Draconisle: for the slideshow or the slider?
[06:29:44] <sunscreen> its chatting fraff
[06:29:49] <sunscreen> thoses scripts are not plain
[06:29:54] <sunscreen> they are script
[06:30:03] <sunscreen> wtf
[06:30:31] <Draconisle> looks like for the slider
[06:30:40] <Draconisle> line 80
[06:34:28] <ShawnRisk> Draconisle: looking
[06:37:33] <ShawnRisk> Draconisle: I don't see that where is that?
[06:39:37] <sunscreen> aha
[06:39:39] <sunscreen> lool
[06:40:32] <stackoverflow> any fancy want to help me 2 secs ?
[06:40:33] <Draconisle> dont worry about it
[06:40:36] <Draconisle> i dont think that is it
[06:42:25] <stackoverflow> i got problems with this script which register inside a cookie if the div shadowed is visible or not
[06:43:02] <Draconisle> so I looked at the only hover
[06:43:08] <stackoverflow> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/RXJ3n/19/  <<<< skip the plugin about cookies , at the very bottom there is the script
[06:43:18] <Draconisle> and the only ones are for the Full box Sliding (hidden to visible)
[06:44:13] <ShawnRisk> okay
[06:44:26] <Draconisle> its pretty simple
[06:44:30] <Draconisle> I cant see the break
[06:44:31] <Draconisle> sorry
[06:45:41] <ShawnRisk> Draconisle: is that for me?
[06:46:16] <Draconisle> yes
[06:46:28] <Draconisle> question though
[06:46:37] <Draconisle> why are you doing a .stop then animating
[06:48:32] <ShawnRisk> I want the slideshow to stop at every slide that is why I put this in, maybe I didn't put in an element which was wrong
[06:48:59] <sunscreen> k
[06:49:56] <Draconisle> chaining sometimes confuses me
[06:50:13] <Draconisle> like the cover.find('p').html(altTxt);
[06:50:46] <monokrome> Does anyone here know how to get jQuery in RequireJS format?
[06:50:54] <Draconisle> I think you can accomplish it with jQuery('p.cover').html(altTxt);
[06:51:06] <monokrome> I'm sure someone has done it
[06:51:19] <fluter>  hi, anyone could help with a jquery form submit question?
[06:53:07] <Draconisle> ShawnRisk: maybe the animate and stop is where you should look
[06:53:13] <ShawnRisk> Draconisle: that doesn't work for me the above code.
[06:53:18] <Draconisle> hmm
[06:53:43] <sunscreen> dabear, no console errors now
[06:53:46] <ShawnRisk> yes but what to change?
[06:53:48] <sunscreen> still fails!!!
[06:54:43] <Draconisle> Shawn:  how are you cycling through the images?
[06:56:13] <ShawnRisk> I am using this plugin: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[06:56:45] <kored> hey yall

[07:09:09] <Spockz> ShawnRisk: chrome
[07:09:32] <ShawnRisk> Spockz: can you try with another one?
[07:10:37] <Spockz> ShawnRisk: not at the moment no
[07:12:24] <ShawnRisk> Spockz: can you try this again but try to hover onto the slideshow coming in from the bottom and than go up into the slideshow?
[07:12:35] <sunscreen> weird netii must of fixed the bizzare timezone bug
[07:12:38] <Spockz> ShawnRisk: it stays

[07:12:45] <sunscreen> oops
[07:13:11] <ShawnRisk> Spockz: yep that is the problem

[07:17:15] <serard> hello
[07:17:20] <mipo> hi
[07:17:35] <serard> I'm trying to use jquery week calendar with jquery ui 1.8.13, but I get an error about .button()
[07:19:07] <ShawnRisk> Spockz: too busy to help?
[07:19:21] <Whirl3d> Which script does your slides plugin?
[07:20:01] <onr> how to define an anonymous function for more than one event?
[07:20:18] <serard> onr, store it in a var ?
[07:20:21] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: using http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/ and the file for the cycle function is utility.js
[07:20:40] <onr> serard: hmm
[07:21:06] <Whirl3d> ShawnRisk, it initializes slides() something or other.. I looked briefly in cycle and didn't see that. I'll look again
[07:21:23] <ShawnRisk> thanks
[07:21:54] <qknight> mipo: thanks
[07:22:08] <mipo> ;)
[07:23:05] <serard> 	$calendarContainer.find(".wc-nav .wc-today").button is not a function <- someone have any clue about this ? jQuery week calendar, jquery 1.6.1 & jquery-ui 1.8.13
[07:25:12] <nnn0> could someone point me in the direction of the best plugin for multiple text columns? :)
[07:29:04] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: any thoughts?
[07:29:46] <Whirl3d> I keep looking for something obvious, but I don't see it. There's way too much code to go through from scratch  without knowing anything about that plugin.
[07:30:40] <Spockz> ShawnRisk: yes
[07:30:49] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: do you just want to know just the jquery?
[07:32:00] <Whirl3d> I can see your code, but there is a lot of it to go through to figure out what looks like a bug inherent in the plugin. Have you checked the source of the plugin to see if anyone else has had a similar problem/solution?
[07:32:26] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: yes I have with no luck
[07:33:16] <tman> i have a sitation where i want to remove elements that are duplicates after they've been brought in via another source.  the way i'm checking for that is by a name attribute....
[07:33:24] <Whirl3d> I wish I had more time to help you, but without some experience with that plugin, I'd just be spinning my wheels for a while. Maybe try another plugin?  Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
[07:33:40] <tman> presently i'm looping through all of them and have the console dumping out the names and i see the duplicates.. just trying to figure out that next step to call the .remove().
[07:34:14] <tman> like how do you compare strings?
[07:34:19] <tman> use the .text() ?
[07:35:10] <ShawnRisk> Whirl3d: no worries
[07:35:25] <ShawnRisk> thanks
[07:35:44] <ShawnRisk> Spockz: thanks for letting me know
[07:39:10] <tman> ah *=

[07:59:46] <Amit> skamikaze, do you mean that I should not use any jquery library urls starting with http://dev.jquery.com/ ?
[07:59:54] <skamikaze> in that special case you can use microsofts cdn for jquery validate
[08:00:42] <skamikaze> afaik that's not a cdn you'd use
[08:00:52] <Amit> Oh! I got. I will take care of this in the code as ms cdn or google cdn.
[08:01:39] <skamikaze> Amit: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation#API_Documentation
[08:01:59] <skamikaze> Amit: http://www.asp.net/ajaxLibrary/CDNjQueryValidate18.ashx
[08:02:31] <ShawnRisk> I have a slider and when I hover over this the slider appears. Â The problem is when I move off the slider sometimes, the slider will be stuck there. Â Any ideas why?
[08:02:39] <Amit> skamikaze, I have exactly gone through the first link you have provided and based on my understanding from this, I have written the code.
[08:02:57] <skamikaze> Amit: check your error console :P
[08:03:35] <Amit> What do you mean by error console? Where I can get it? I am writing the code in notepad and using firefox browser to check the output result.
[08:03:58] <Amit> But still figuring out to validate the text field based on regrex.
[08:04:30] <skamikaze> Amit: extras => error console
[08:04:57] <skamikaze> Amit: go checkout firebug or use any webkits dev console
[08:05:45] <Amit> I would appreciate if you can provide me any link which is using regrex to validate text field using jquery, If you know of. I even tried to find any website who is using jquery and regrex to validate the input but all in wain.
[08:05:54] <stackoverflow> god this is driving me crazy
[08:06:04] <Amit> So I need to download firebug. I will do that surely.
[08:06:08] <stackoverflow> why the content of cookie report null =|
[08:06:21] <stackoverflow> if i refresh page
[08:06:34] <stackoverflow> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/RXJ3n/34/
[08:06:54] <stackoverflow> if cookie is setted to 1 it must write 1 not null
[08:08:00] <skamikaze> stackoverflow: for testing $.cookie maybe don't use jsfiddle - never tried it there as you deal with iframes there
[08:08:21] <stackoverflow> if you try to push
[08:08:31] <stackoverflow> you will see the cookie is setted
[08:08:33] <skamikaze> Amit: firefox => go extras => addons => firebug
[08:08:54] <stackoverflow> but when i refresh the page it reports the cookie is null
[08:09:04] <ShawnRisk> sorry I am back
[08:09:10] <stackoverflow> im also tsting this on local machine
[08:09:18] <stackoverflow> but it gives the same response
[08:09:34] <Amit> Thanks skamikaze. Downloading firebug and will to as you have told. Thanks for your great support.
[08:09:34] <stackoverflow> so jsfiddle is working like the loca machine .....something its wrong

[08:21:27] <stackoverflow> try to add that code to your script and watch wut will happen when you move the mouse out of the slider
[08:22:57] <stackoverflow> or maybe your script has some play pause function
[08:22:57] <ShawnRisk> stackoverflow: do you want to see the code?
[08:23:53] <sunscreen> Is here a better way to put this to the users: Oops! Flash is not supported by your device you can select an option below to solve this
[08:24:10] <sunscreen> does sound relatively user friendly
[08:24:16] <sunscreen> does it
[08:24:17] <sunscreen> ?
[08:24:25] <stackoverflow> not really :P
[08:24:41] <stackoverflow> it sounds mafia friendly
[08:25:06] <sunscreen> what would you put? lol
[08:25:10] <ShawnRisk> I took out the play pause function and that didn't fix this
[08:25:46] <ShawnRisk> stackoverflow: ^
[08:25:52] <stackoverflow> hem
[08:26:02] <stackoverflow> setup play function on mouse out
[08:26:37] <stackoverflow> your slider has videos flash or or any particular content ?

[08:28:11] <stackoverflow> it must hide the div when you leave mouse ?
[08:28:21] <ShawnRisk> oh let me try that
[08:29:01] <stackoverflow> leave that function
[08:29:15] <stackoverflow> jQuery(".cover").mouseleave(function() {
[08:29:15] <stackoverflow>                         jQuery(".cover").hide();
[08:29:15] <stackoverflow>                         }); <<<<<<<<<<<<all these lines

[08:32:54] <stackoverflow> also the big pictures ?
[08:33:29] <ShawnRisk> stackoverflow: go from the bottom of the slideshow, and stop on the slider and then go up to the image until you are out of the slideshow.
[08:33:43] <stackoverflow> ah
[08:33:46] <stackoverflow> i got it
[08:34:11] <stackoverflow> the bug happens when you pass with the mouse on the big pict
[08:34:17] <stackoverflow> and the move out
[08:34:25] <stackoverflow> then*
[08:35:31] <ShawnRisk> stackoverflow: I believe so at the moment that is the issue
[08:37:57] <lonimurar> is it possible to "extract" and use a number from a string with jquery? for example, the 8 from this string "foo 8 bar"

[08:40:45] <stackoverflow> wtf
[08:41:09] <stackoverflow> you gave field-content class to the span and to another div

[08:41:31] <stackoverflow> id must be assigned to the single elements
[08:42:05] <amirite> anyone know what the standard is for custom <select> boxes
[08:42:20] <amirite> like, what do people generally do? make a ul w/ height and overflow?

[08:58:38] <djQuery> stackoverflow: thats just silly so as soon as you hover over it hide itself? so as soon as it hidden the mouse wont be over it again so it shows?
[08:58:40] <monokrome> (with jQuery UI)
[08:59:31] <stackoverflow> ah you a re rite
[09:00:56] <djQuery> monokrome: set active: -1, collapsible: true

[09:02:04] <stackoverflow> dj can you tell me why when i refresh the page the cookie content is null ?
[09:02:07] <stackoverflow> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/RXJ3n/36/
[09:02:35] <stackoverflow> im using cookie to register if the div must be shown or hidden
[09:03:49] <djQuery> becase I have never been able to get cookie work on there?
[09:06:04] <stackoverflow> but it happens also on locahost
[09:08:59] <stackoverflow> god im loosing my moral integrity and im gonna scream vs the world !
[09:09:03] <djQuery> stackoverflow: http://jsfiddle.net/RXJ3n/38/
[09:09:13] <ShawnRisk> stackoverflow: hi
[09:11:09] <djQuery> stackoverflow: ?
[09:12:10] <stackoverflow> it doesnt work dj
[09:12:22] <stackoverflow> its setting cookie always = true
[09:13:43] <monokrome> It seems that initializing an accordion on an object that has been hidden has unexpected results :/
[09:13:44] <stackoverflow> i get exactlly the same cookie status you see on jsfiddle
[09:14:07] <stackoverflow> when i apply that modifies on localhost
[09:15:32] <hever> I've this simple HTML markup: http://pastebin.com/rpBztG7d  If I apply this simple selection $("td:contains('VAL 1')").next().text().replace(/\s\s+/g, ' '); I'm getting " Yes Yes " as result. I just need the first occourence. I tried [0], slice(), first() but nothing seems to work. What am I missing?

[09:24:53] <oal> Anyone here using coffeescript with jquery ui and can provide me with a widget "skeleton"?
[09:27:36] <manixrock> does jquery standardize the ondragstart event? for example in FF <3.5 the event is called 'dragstart'
[09:29:15] <djQuery> stackoverflow: can you try this on ur machine http://jsfiddle.net/RXJ3n/39/

[09:46:36] <sunscreen> use but not using dynamic images i was going to make a it into a php
[09:46:54] <sunscreen> er make a php script to write ou the <li> DoctorDarren
[09:47:23] <ravenzz> DoctorDarren could you provide a live example? or a code snippet?
[09:47:30] <ravenzz> ?p @ DoctorDarren
[09:47:30] <bot-t> DoctorDarren, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[09:48:08] <DoctorDarren> sunscreen: Well they have to be loaded dynamically via JS, server-side not an option for rendering
[09:48:19] <DoctorDarren> ravenzz: Sure just give me a moment
[09:48:27] <DoctorDarren> ravenzz: Might be onto something
[09:48:39] <|RicharD|> hi i have a question...
[09:49:08] <jrockjiggz> don't do it!
[09:49:12] <|RicharD|> :P
[09:49:37] <|RicharD|> http://jsfiddle.net/2EBWH/
[09:49:59] <|RicharD|> i have this jquery plugn for panning image...it's possibile use a copy and paste for multiple image panning ?
[09:51:17] <jrockjiggz> is each $imagePan unique then? why not add the same class to each img
[09:52:05] <mipo> what is this? e.preventDefault();
[09:52:36] <jrockjiggz> mipo: preventDefault() is much like return false; but is specific only to the action and not the script as a whole
[09:52:59] <jrockjiggz> mipo: google  e.preventDefault() vs. return false;
[09:53:04] <|RicharD|> what you mean ?
[09:53:30] <mipo> jrockjiggz thanks
[09:54:25] <jrockjiggz> |RicharD|: your paste is pretty unclear.....
[09:55:19] <DoctorDarren> ravenzz: Hey, well for example just in this example: http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/static_simple.html   Where is the function that's pulling in the images? Or are they just hard-coded into the <body> already?
[09:56:03] <|RicharD|> no why it
[09:56:04] <|RicharD|> want a div
[09:56:42] <DoctorDarren> Okay just established that they're hard-coded, which I thought would defeat the purpose of .add()
[09:56:44] <ravenzz> DoctorDarren each image is already in your markup
[09:56:50] <|RicharD|> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/671734890
[09:57:07] <|RicharD|> i tried with 2 variable in the js function but not work
[09:57:34] <ravenzz> uhm you should take a look at the Docs
[09:57:45] <binni> with jquery ui connected sortable lists.. when I drag from one list to the other, once the item "leaves the first list" while I still hold it, the area where it was collapses, can it be made not to collapse until I've actually dropped the item (to another list)?
[09:57:46] <DoctorDarren> ravenzz: yeah gonna re-read, thanks for looking
[09:58:21] <jrockjiggz> mipo: this might also help understand event bubbling http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[09:58:22] <ravenzz> otherwise i think that you can do it, but you have to update the width of the container and clip
[09:59:42] <mipo> jrockjiggz thanks!
[09:59:43] <ravenzz> DoctorDarren but i suppose that you don't need to do that. look at the Dynamic Examples
[10:01:30] <jrockjiggz> |RicharD|: it looks like the script is designed for 1 image container only, to have multiple, you would either need to convert the script to be flexible like a plugin, or duplicate the script and change all the unique IDs.   As for calling seperate script.. i'll give an example
[10:01:53] <|RicharD|> jrockjiggz: umh ... :S oki
[10:03:15] <Blazento> How, if i have an <ul> can i select its child <li>'s without also selecting the <li>'s <ul><li>'s
[10:03:29] <|RicharD|> jrockjiggz: i tried with also duplicated id...see here: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1098150146
[10:03:34] <djQuery> Blazento: see .children
[10:03:45] <DoctorDarren> ravenzz: Ah you're right, hadn't look at their souce.
[10:03:50] <DoctorDarren> source*
[10:03:59] <Alexer> is there any way to poke jQuery plugin internals? for example, the ui.autocomplete plugin has "this.menu = ..." inside "_create", can i get to it somehow?
[10:04:24] <djQuery> you could over ride the _create
[10:05:11] <djQuery> alexer do a search for jquery +duckpunch
[10:05:14] <jrockjiggz> |RicharD|: http://bin.cakephp.org/pastes/edit/67431
[10:05:45] <Alexer> djQuery, thanks
[10:06:05] <|RicharD|> ?
[10:06:08] <|RicharD|> don't see nothing
[10:06:30] <djQuery> Alexer: or tell us why you want access to it
[10:07:05] <|RicharD|> jrockjiggz: you can re-paste it pls ?
[10:07:13] <jrockjiggz> Blazento: $('ul li:not(:has(ul))')
[10:07:22] <zangetsu> hi
[10:08:06] <jrockjiggz> |RicharD|: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/2075890252
[10:08:49] <|RicharD|> jrockjiggz: oki now i work on it and keep you update
[10:09:00] <|RicharD|> thx a lot
[10:09:35] <Alexer> djQuery, i'm trying to modify ui.autocomplete to include a footer after the suggested items. i thought it'd be easier to test things from the firebug console than by modifying the autocompleter javascript and reloading the page...
[10:09:37] <jrockjiggz> you need your outer Divs to have unique IDs, and rename the Ids in your duplicate code.  this isn't exactly elegant, but i think your just looking for a fix
[10:11:08] <Blazento> thanks guys. those are both awesome
[10:11:09] <binni> when picking up an item in a list (li in a ul) that is made sortable with jquery ui, the space where it was collapses, can I have it not collapse until I have actually dropped it?
[10:11:47] <zangetsu> $.when( callback1, callback2 ) run: callback1 and now callback2 when callback1 return a defer.resolve?
[10:12:01] <zangetsu> i need to run callbacks in this order
[10:13:47] <Alexer> djQuery, so i basically have to replace the whole plugin? there's no way to re-use the old internals or affect already created instances?
[10:14:36] <djQuery> Alexer: try look at the custom rendering example
[10:15:26] <djQuery> Alexer: and couldnt you just call wrap on the menu and then append a span to it
[10:17:01] <cool> Hello Everyone!
[10:17:40] <Jakey> so
[10:17:40] <djQuery> Alexer: nope not realy because the show would only show the menu not the div that it is wrapped in
[10:17:42] <Jakey> sup
[10:18:23] <Alexer> djQuery, the autocompleter calls a bunch of functions on this.menu, so i don't think that'd work
[10:20:14] <Alexer> but meh, if it's this hard to get to the internals, i guess i'll just do it the hard way (as in, start refreshing the page instead of trying to play around in js console)
[10:20:21] <Alexer> djQuery, thanks for the help :)
[10:20:25] <djQuery> Alexer: why not just append a <li> that is not selectable to the end of the menu? doesnt it have a show callback that you could append it at?
[10:21:16] <djQuery> Alexer: you could use the open callback
[10:21:24] <cool> I am looking for a jQuery based Image Slider. I know there ton of them, but my needs are bit different. I need an image slider which can display 4 different images with Captions at same time. http://i.imgur.com/SYu53.png Any idea which slider should I use?
[10:22:23] <Alexer> djQuery, i'm not sure if you can make a <li> non-selectable, i'm gonna try that though. not sure about show-callback, haven't stumbled upon that or an open-callback (unless that's some universal thing)
[10:23:06] <djQuery> Alexer: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#event-open
[10:23:52] <djQuery> Alexer: you could apply a custom select callback as well to test if the one that they selected is your and just return false;
[10:24:03] <|RicharD|> jrockjiggz: i tried to do with your method
[10:24:19] <|RicharD|> but not show the second image and not work the effect if i force the show of second image
[10:24:43] <|RicharD|> http://airrus.infase.info/products/show/puls-r# you can see here as on div #outer_container_spinning all oki
[10:24:50] <|RicharD|> in div #outer_container_casting no :S
[10:25:06] <|RicharD|> not show it and if i do with a display: block or other not work the mouse move
[10:25:37] <Alexer> djQuery, thanks again, that'll get me going :)
[10:27:06] <|RicharD|> any idea or suggest ?
[10:34:40] <lenswipe> guys
[10:34:58] <lenswipe> shouldnt $(parent).find('.bottomblock').height() return the height of the first element with the class bottomblock?
[10:36:35] <m3nt0r> hmm
[10:36:52] <m3nt0r> i'd guess so.
[10:37:17] <lenswipe> hmm
[10:37:21] <lenswipe> cos its returning "null"
[10:37:24] <m3nt0r> maybe you have to wrap it in another $() ?
[10:37:30] <lenswipe> maybe
[10:37:58] <m3nt0r> does find(.bottomblock) return anything?
[10:38:27] <lenswipe> m3nt0r yep it returns:                 console.log($(parent).find('.bottomblock')());
[10:38:29] <lenswipe> ewps
[10:38:36] <lenswipe> it returns: Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function
[10:39:00] <m3nt0r> you have "()" at the end of find()
[10:39:16] <lenswipe> hmm
[10:39:58] <lenswipe> m3nt0r it returns false
[10:41:30] <m3nt0r> i think you dont have jquery properly running
[10:42:01] <m3nt0r> i can type whatever i want in find(), matching or not, and i always get a function back
[10:42:05] <m3nt0r> never "false"
[10:42:40] <DoctorDarren> I'm getting an error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'nodeName' of undefined" with jCarousel when I run  "carousel.add(1, "Testing");". Can anybody tell me what would be undefined?
[10:42:51] <m3nt0r> just for fun, try the same query but instead of "$" use "jQuery"
[10:51:41] <itissid> Hey is the browser not supposed to follow a 302 response after a $.post()?
[10:51:56] <itissid> I thought it should but for some reason it aint
[10:52:36] <pifantastic> I think it should
[10:52:43] <pifantastic> Are you inspecting headers?
[10:53:21] <itissid> pifantastic, Yeah my chrome debugger shows a clear statuscode of 302
[10:53:35] <itissid> xhr.getallresponseheaders are null
[10:53:47] <pifantastic> hmm
[10:53:56] <pifantastic> is this public?
[10:54:12] <itissid> YEah one sec
[10:54:16] <itissid> http://204.232.211.180:3000/
[10:54:31] <itissid> This page issues a $.post() to get_tweets
[10:54:37] <itissid> after 3 seconds
[10:54:44] <itissid> and the headers are all ok
[10:55:00] <itissid> the browser should redirect in an ideal world..
[10:55:25] <pifantastic> the ajax request does redirect
[10:55:27] <pifantastic> to /connect
[10:55:44] <itissid> pifantastic, Its happening in your browser?
[10:55:50] <abjorn> jesus christ. I don't know how I don't have a terrible hang over right now, I got so unbelievably fucked up last night lol
[10:55:50] <bot-t> (22 hours 30 mins ago) <imsky> tell abjorn i got hit with a power outage lol
[10:55:55] <abjorn> oh shit
[10:56:57] <pifantastic> itissid: the redirect is part of the Ajax request
[10:57:03] <pifantastic> it's not going to redirect the browser
[10:57:32] <itissid> pifantastic, Ok so the responseheaders are blank why do you think?
[10:57:32] <pifantastic> if you want to redirect the browser you're going to need to submit a form or set document.location
[10:57:44] <pifantastic> itissid: the response headers aren't blank
[10:58:07] <itissid> pifantastic, as in the success handler the 3rd argument is blank
[10:58:22] <itissid> xhr.getallresponseheaders()
[10:59:07] <itissid> So my question is how do I detect a redirect?
[10:59:27] <pifantastic> hmm
[11:00:57] <mipo> what is .live?
[11:01:03] <itissid> pifantastic, I guess for now I will just hack it and send a JSON message to tell the handler to redirect
[11:01:06] <pifantastic> ?live
[11:01:06] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[11:01:17] <pifantastic> itissid: yeah that should work
[11:01:20] <pifantastic> Why are you not just using the public API?
[11:01:36] <itissid> pifantastic, public API?
[11:01:58] <itissid> of what?
[11:02:28] <pifantastic> Twitter
[11:03:38] <pifantastic> i.e. http://search.twitter.com/search.json?&q=jquery&result_type=recent&rpp=100&callback=ohai
[11:05:27] <itissid> pifantastic, Well some methods I need are only available via authentication like http://dev.twitter.com/doc/get/users/search
[11:05:40] <pifantastic> ah, cool
[11:06:27] <itissid> pifantastic, I dont think the public API is realtime..
[11:06:32] <itissid> OMG
[11:06:37] <itissid> What s going on
[11:06:39] <jedimind_> YOU BROKE THE INTERWEBS itissid

[11:11:36] <lenswipe> anyone know why sizes = sizes.reverse(); produces: [155, 145, 145, 299]
[11:13:30] <pifantastic> ?eval sizes = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]; sizes.reverse();
[11:13:32] <bot-t> pifantastic: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[11:13:32] <cool> Hi, I am looking for a javascript based alternative of the following Flash based Image slideshow. Any idea where I can find that matches closes to this flash based solution? http://osc4.template-help.com/joomla_30291/
[11:14:11] <lenswipe> pifantastic any ideas?
[11:14:25] <lenswipe> ?eval sizes =[155, 145, 145, 299]; sizes.reverse();
[11:14:25] <bot-t> lenswipe: [299, 145, 145, 155]
[11:14:42] <lenswipe> ?eval sizes =[155, 145, 145, 299]; sizes.sort();
[11:14:43] <bot-t> lenswipe: [145, 145, 155, 299]
[11:14:52] <pifantastic> lenswipe: what are you trying to do?
[11:14:58] <pifantastic> reverse/sort modify the array
[11:15:02] <lenswipe> pifantastic yes
[11:15:03] <pifantastic> in place
[11:15:09] <lenswipe> and its returing [155, 145, 145, 299] for some reason
[11:15:26] <pifantastic> ?p @ lenswipe
[11:15:26] <bot-t> lenswipe, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[11:15:50] <stefancrs_> ok, I have a form (with a php backend) that currently can submit and create a calendar event. Furthermore, I have now created a function (in php) that can check if an event is conflicting with other events / times when the calendar is "closed" (responds with json data). What I'd like to do is change it so that when I click on "submit" in the form, if there ARE NO conflicts, the event gets created, but if there conflicts, I want to
[11:16:09] <stefancrs_> "hey, there are conflicts, do you want to force this event to be created anyway?" and a "force event" button
[11:16:17] <stefancrs_> any ideas as how to one should go about doing this?
[11:16:24] <stefancrs_> I'm a jquery noob
[11:16:24] <qknight> i want to hide all <ul class="foo"><.... except the one i clicked (if i click one of the ul things class="foo" but how to know?
[11:16:48] <qknight> i already can $('ul.foo').hide();
[11:17:44] <m3nt0r> qknight:  .click(function(){ $('ul.foo').not(this).hide() }); .. i think
[11:20:40] <lenswipe> pifantastic http://jsfiddle.net/hpZPs/
[11:21:55] <qknight> m3nt0r: i guess you are right but it does not work but the .not should be used like you told me i expect
[11:22:06] <qknight> but it does not work as it collapses all elements
[11:22:38] <qknight> m3nt0r: maybe because i select the wrong thing as it is invoked by a 'a'-tag so i have to select the parten of the a tag
[11:23:33] <m3nt0r> qknight: best would be to add a class to the ul you clicked like ".selected" and then do the hide with a selector excluding that class
[11:24:40] <cool> Hi, I am looking for a javascript based alternative of the following Flash based Image slideshow. Any idea where I can find that matches closes to this flash based solution? http://osc4.template-help.com/joomla_30291/
[11:25:01] <pifantastic> lenswipe: I see: 21320,242,20
[11:25:02] <m3nt0r> qknight: then you could do $('ul.foo:not(.selected)').hide()
[11:25:05] <pifantastic> whic is expected, right?
[11:25:09] <lenswipe> pifantastic hang on
[11:25:16] <lenswipe> pifantastic http://jsfiddle.net/hpZPs/9/
[11:25:18] <lenswipe> thats it
[11:26:19] <pifantastic> 200,242,20 as expected
[11:26:24] <pifantastic> what's the problem?
[11:28:10] <phobia> Hi guys :) I'm running into this scope issue that I can't for the life of me remember how is usually solved. On a click event I have a function that uses a variable outside of that function, so the click event works fine for the first click, but not the second. It's the "value" variable in this paste: http://pastebin.com/xpzk8r5D  any ideas how to fix? :)
[11:28:18] <qknight> m3nt0r: i don't understand what you say but i will look at that: but why could this code not do anything?: $(this).next('ul.foo').hide(); <- absolutely no effect
[11:29:13] <m3nt0r> qknight: because "this" is something else that is not "next" to a ul.foo ?
[11:29:27] <pifantastic> phobia: I think that should work...
[11:29:41] <|RicharD|> anybody know a method
[11:29:51] <lenswipe> pifantastic the problem is why reverse() isnt sorting the stuff on my end here
[11:29:53] <m3nt0r> qknight: i would monitor "this" in your console and click around and see what elements you get and then come up with a seletor
[11:29:55] <|RicharD|> for change a attr css in live ?
[11:30:00] <ravenzz> isnt value a js reserved name?
[11:30:09] <|RicharD|> i have a attr that change at every mouve over
[11:30:57] <phobia> pifantastic: well, if I log the value to console it says "undefined" on the second click
[11:37:02] <ravenzz> phobia add some HTML and reproduce your issue on jsfiddle
[11:37:25] <qknight> m3nt0r: ok, i'll do that
[11:37:27] <phobia> ravenzz: good idea, will do, thanks :)
[11:37:27] <ravenzz> dont care about fancybox.. just do something simpler
[11:37:41] <ravenzz> like add a css border
[11:37:46] <ravenzz> (in your example)
[11:37:52] <m3nt0r> qknight: i assume you bound .click to "ul.foo" ?
[11:38:21] <m3nt0r> qknight: that way "this" should always be a "ul.foo"
[11:38:42] <m3nt0r> qknight: and then you can do .next() and .not() with it
[11:40:56] <fra79Wii> hi all, I would like to be able to scroll a div, but with the scrollbar hidden (overflow:hidden)... I might found some workaround, but wanted to know if there is already something in jquery...
[11:43:31] <qknight> m3nt0r: no i did not. my code looks like that: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/397279/ (hope this minimal examples helps to illustrate my situation)
[11:43:59] <papyromancer> where do I go for help with ie8 qunit tests failing setup and teardown?
[11:49:09] <m3nt0r>  qknight: see if that works http://paste.pocoo.org/show/397281/
[11:51:08] <qknight> m3nt0r: this is just great! thanks so much
[11:51:18] <m3nt0r> qknight: your welcome
[11:53:25] <phobia> ravenzz: recreating the problem made me realize that fancybox is the problem, not the scope.. fancybox alters the variable contents it seems
[11:54:27] <ravenzz> uhm
[11:54:38] <ravenzz> that should be the matter
[11:54:43] <ravenzz> dunno
[11:55:34] <ravenzz> i think that your code could be rewritten in a strong way
[11:56:16] <ravenzz> but i should take a look at the html
[11:56:44] <ShawnRisk1> stackoverflow: hi
[11:58:03] <monokrom1> Are you trying to make it not click on parents?
[11:59:00] <monokrome> or are you trying something else?

[12:13:06] <EDK> hey to all....  Is there any jquery slider which helps me to display the live streaming..?
[12:16:51] <TheIronSky> THE LIVE STREAMING
[12:17:01] <TheIronSky> I wish you'd be more specific
[12:20:10] <EDK> TheIronSky... Hey
[12:20:25] <TheIronSky> O HELLO THERE
[12:20:52] <TheIronSky> why don't you explain just what "The live streaming" refers to, EDK
[12:21:02] <EDK> I am trying to load the script on the main window where user will click and watch screaming videos
[12:21:18] <TheIronSky> A window or a div?
[12:21:23] <EDK> a div
[12:21:33] <EDK> sorry, let me show you
[12:21:33] <TheIronSky> okay, so why do you need a slider?
[12:21:47] <EDK> becoz i want to display this slider on our home page
[12:21:53] <EDK> there are 3 tabs
[12:22:19] <TheIronSky> so you're looking to recreate the IGN homepage slideshow with streaming footage
[12:22:22] <TheIronSky> ?
[12:22:41] <EDK> one has live streaming video, 2 one has live timing(Java applet), and third one has just a hyperlink for directing to another kind of info
[12:23:33] <EDK> yes
[12:24:17] <TheIronSky> do you want it to feature auto-scrolling so it plays out like a slideshow?
[12:25:18] <TheIronSky> EDK, http://www.setsolid.net/ign/
[12:25:22] <TheIronSky> enjoy
[12:29:40] <^robertj> under what conditions will mouse events not fire on absolutely positioned elements?
[12:30:16] <dismist> when they are under an element
[12:30:45] <^robertj> dismist, i'v set the z-index very high on this element and it's still not working
[12:31:09] <dismist> put a border on it and make sure its keeping the proper height/width
[12:31:26] <dismist> then put background colors on any elements that might be on top of it to check to see if they indeed are superceding its z-index
[12:31:55] <fallingmeat_> anyone in here having issues with codaslider freaking out after about a minute on page?
[12:32:26] <fallingmeat_> coda seems to load OK, but after about 60 sec, the slides start auto changing without any interval time
[12:32:52] <fallingmeat_> seems like very little support for that plugin anyway
[12:32:55] <^robertj> dismist, appears to be
[12:33:07] <^robertj> overflow: is set to hidden
[12:33:18] <^robertj> but i can see the black borders on the top and left
[12:33:36] <^robertj> since width and height are 100% cant see the bottom and right borders since tehey are pushed off the screen
[12:33:45] <^robertj> http://webclient.caskeytranscription.com/thick/
[12:37:25] <phobia> http://jsfiddle.net/ektw3/ <- I've set up an example where clicking that "see screenshot" link works the first time, but not the second, due to that Fancybox seems to alter my variable. Got any ideas how to fix this issue? :)
[12:38:57] <phobia> it's the "images" variable that being changed. It starts off as an array, but ends up being some kind of jquery object
[12:42:21] <^robertj> dismist, if I set position: from absolute to fixed it breaks my intended behavior but the click does register
[12:46:42] <qknight> i guess i can't use slideDown() instead of hide() or toggle() without changing anything, right?
[12:48:17] <sunscreen> whch is a great android phone... i have a iphone 4 a bb 9300 curve they look well together
[12:48:23] <phobia> hmm .. I really don't get this. Now I tried getting the data via a function, even then the data is altered.. http://jsfiddle.net/ektw3/4/
[12:48:28] <sunscreen> for a set of links
[12:48:30] <ssfsam> how can u use $.get() to get value from c# code behind method ?
[12:53:40] <qknight> ok got it working but seems to work much differnet than expected ;-)
[12:53:46] <EDK> guys, is it possible to load videos and java applet on this example ... http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/examples/image-rotator/
[12:55:08] <nerk> does anyone know if it is possible to make $.load() run js included in a page fragment?
[12:55:57] <jrockjiggz> $(url + ' #fragment'); .. and yes if you have js in <script></script> it will run
[12:56:17] <jrockjiggz> but the <script> must be inside your fragment
[12:56:37] <nerk> hrrm
[12:56:39] <nerk> odd
[12:56:42] <nerk> it's not running it
[12:56:48] <jrockjiggz> actually.. i've never tested this
[12:56:53] <nerk> I have a simple alert('hi');
[12:59:21] <Matias> I'm trying to create an ajax request from localhost:80 to localhost:1234, is it considered another server? I think it's not doing it at all (firebug doesn't show anything, but if I remove "1234" it does)!
[13:00:17] <Obvious> `sop
[13:00:27] <Obvious> erm.
[13:00:28] <|RicharD|> hi to all... http://airrus.infase.info/products/show/puls-r# anybody can show
[13:00:40] <|RicharD|> if switch from spinning to casting and the image panning work fine ?
[13:00:54] <|RicharD|> some users tell me that there is a problem in spinning panning
[13:01:02] <Obvious> Matias, http://google.com/search?q=same+origin+mdc
[13:01:03] <|RicharD|> with space at left and img cutten at right
[13:01:04] <jrockjiggz> nerk: i'm testing your issue
[13:01:13] <nerk> thx
[13:01:27] <nerk> looking around google to see if anyone has anything up about it
[13:02:12] <jrockjiggz> nerk: can you use getScript() ?
[13:02:48] <nerk> ug.
[13:03:01] <Matias> ahmn, thanks
[13:03:07] <jrockjiggz> nerk: i've always placed my code in my parent document, refering to any elements that may load in using live()
[13:03:09] <nerk> I am loading html :)
[13:03:36] <nerk> that has some js in it
[13:03:41] <nerk> not just something with js in it
[13:07:01] <agib> is there a good way to tell if a browser supports the css "pointer-events:none;" ?
[13:07:32] <Edler> what's pointer-events ?
[13:07:51] <noxxten> Anyone know of a good place to pick up jquery with no previous scripting knowledge beforehand?
[13:08:06] <Edler> what do you mean "pick up" jquery ?
[13:08:15] <Edler> like start using it without having any clue ?
[13:08:16] <|RicharD|> anybdy can check it pls ?
[13:08:24] <agib> Edler: basically whether or not an element triggers mouse events or whether it let's those events pass through to elements under it
[13:08:48] <Edler> agib: not sure, check moderniz3r maybe it can check that
[13:09:01] <Edler> modernizer*
[13:09:16] <noxxten> edler: yep, I'm trying to find a good resource to learn jQuery. Maybe some tutorials or something heh.
[13:09:27] <Edler> noxxten: do you know javascript ?
[13:09:34] <agib> Edler: hmm doesn't seem to
[13:09:44] <Edler> no idea then, sorry :(
[13:10:04] <noxxten> edler: Nope, just html and css.
[13:10:17] <Edler> it is better to learn javascript before you learn jquery
[13:10:49] <Jakey> lol
[13:10:55] <Edler> heh
[13:11:55] <noxxten> Edler: Heh, good point. In that case, do you know of any javascript-for-noobs tutorials or guides I can read through? :p
[13:12:09] <Edler> i know one good one but it's in french
[13:12:20] <Edler> if not you can pick up a book like Javascript : the good parts
[13:12:21] <noxxten> Darn.
[13:12:44] <Edler> there's also Javascript : The definitive guide
[13:12:57] <Edler> but this one teaches more of an ECMAScript approach and is huge
[13:13:03] <nlogax> maybe this? https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide
[13:13:08] <noxxten> I actually have a jQuery and Javascript books, they're just based off the older releases... like versions 1.2 or so...
[13:13:16] <Edler> versions of what ?
[13:13:24] <Edler> nlogax: good link
[13:13:41] <Edler> noxxten: javascript hasn't relaly been change for the past 12 years
[13:13:46] <jrockjiggz> ?101 @ noxxten
[13:13:47] <bot-t> noxxten, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[13:14:05] <Edler> nice
[13:14:09] <noxxten> Thanks nlogax, and older versions of jQuery. but that wouldn't effect Javascript now that I think about it lol.
[13:14:23] <nlogax> :)
[13:14:30] <^robertj> apparently width:100%;height:100% was bad but left:0px right:0px top:0px bottom:0px works fine
[13:14:39] <noxxten> Thanks guys. I'll go through these guides and see what I can do. :D
[13:14:49] <Edler> noxxten: are you learning it to do something specific ? or want to learn in general
[13:15:00] <Edler> if there's something you wanna code fast in your page, we can help
[13:15:16] <iamjarvo> is it possible to have an open all sections with the jquery ui accordion
[13:15:28] <Edler> iamjarvo: i guess so
[13:15:54] <noxxten> Edler: I'm just trying to widen my skills repitor. I've been freelancing lately and had to turn down a few jobs because my jQuery and Javascript knowledge wasn't up to par.
[13:16:09] <stefancrs_> If I want to hook up an event handler but make sure it only gets done once, should I check if it's already been set? currently, I add the handler on an ajax success, should I use live or delegate instead?
[13:16:17] <Edler> noxxten: wise move to stay up to date and learn JS, JS is the future
[13:16:34] <noxxten> Edler: So I've heard :)
[13:16:36] <Edler> use delegate
[13:16:44] <nlogax> and the past! and present!
[13:16:53] <Edler> cause if you set it twice, it will exist twice
[13:16:56] <Edler> not get overwritten
[13:17:05] <Edler> yup! long live JS
[13:17:59] <stefancrs_> Edler: currently, I do $('#bookorcloseform').submit(blablabla), how would I do the same with delegate?
[13:18:06] <lucian> Edler: sad, isn't it?
[13:18:12] <stefancrs_> <- noob
[13:18:16] <Edler> lol
[13:18:19] <Edler> okay stefancrs_
[13:18:20] <Edler> 1 sec
[13:18:29] <stefancrs_> 'priciated
[13:18:35] <Edler> put that bookorcloseform inside some div
[13:18:41] <phobia> man ... sorry to keep posting about this issue, but it's driving me nuts. Try clicking the "see screenshot" link here http://jsfiddle.net/ektw3/15/ it will work once, but not the second time (you close the lightbox with esc). Is it something stupid I'm doing wrong? the weird thing is that if I, instead of using the variable array, use the array directly like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ektw3/17/ it works :P
[13:18:41] <Edler> which we will delegate to
[13:18:48] <Edler> then you do
[13:18:56] <Matias> how would you call a webservice in the same server but running on other port if you can't have a proxy?
[13:19:17] <Edler> $("#the_outer_div").delegate("#bookorcloseform", "submit", blablabla)
[13:19:28] <Edler> Matias: you can't on client side
[13:19:41] <Edler> you can only communicate with the same port and same host/domain
[13:20:07] <Matias> then I lost some days tring to do so xD
[13:20:14] <iamjarvo> Edler:  mind pointing me in the right direction
[13:20:24] <EDK> how can i load external streaming clip code on it ...http://www.samirayousefi.com/slider/
[13:20:28] <EDK> please help me :(
[13:20:31] <Edler> iamjarvo: what's your question ?
[13:21:22] <EDK> i want to load an external souce code of live streaming ... when someone will click on big image div ....
[13:21:24] <iamjarvo> Edler:  opening all the accordions at once for the jquery ui
[13:21:29] <iamjarvo> like a reveal all
[13:21:45] <stefancrs_> Edler: excellent! thanks
[13:21:48] <Edler> oops iamjarvo
[13:22:04] <Edler> just foudn this : An accordion doesn't allow more than one content panel to be open at the same time, and it takes a lot of effort to do that. If you are looking for a widget that allows more than one content panel to be open, don't use this.
[13:22:25] <Edler> so don't use jqueryui's accordion if you wanna open them all
[13:22:30] <Edler> code your own
[13:22:45] <iamjarvo> Edler:  ahh i read that. i was just making sure! thank you!
[13:23:24] <stefancrs_> Edler: now, the actual form changes using ajax, but not the form id (or target). the id of the submit-button changes though, and I actually only want to do this when that id is a specific one. should I just check that in the handler? Or is there a smarter way?
[13:23:37] <mplabs> Edler, i'm sorry, I lost my connection. I have been creating a webservice system to avoid to have this script running in Apache, I can't create a proxy because it would be the same, it uses a long polling connection :|
[13:23:42] <tman> 			if ($("body").hasClass("category") || $("body").hasClass("search") ) {
[13:23:42] <tman>  <- is there a way to express that in 1 condition?
[13:23:53] <tman> i tried "category search"
[13:23:55] <tman> didn't work though.
[13:24:13] <Edler> mplabs: what are you trying to accomplish ?
[13:24:52] <Edler> tamn: no, these are 2 distinct expressions
[13:25:01] <Edler> stefancrs_: do you have alink ?
[13:25:08] <tman> so i can't have it cycle through a bunch of classes in 1 go
[13:25:09] <tman> ok
[13:25:13] <mplabs> I wanted to do a long polling connection but Apache doesn't support it well so I created a Node.js server and it's running on other port. now my idea was to request this webservice
[13:25:13] <Edler> tman: however
[13:25:14] <Edler> you can do this
[13:25:18] * tman listens
[13:25:22] <stefancrs_> Edler: to the site? sorry, no, devving locally and under NDA :)
[13:25:29] <mplabs> and as I said, since it uses a long polling request, I can't have a proxy
[13:25:34] <Edler> if($(this).id('.category, .bar'))
[13:25:36] <Edler> i guess so
[13:25:54] <EDK> how can i load external script for live streaming on the big image div on $(".main_image .block").animate({ opacity: 0, marginBottom: -imgDescHeight }, 250 , function() {
[13:25:54] <EDK> 				$(".main_image .block").html(imgDesc).animate({ opacity: 0.85,	marginBottom: "0" }, 250 );
[13:25:54] <EDK> 				$(".main_image img").attr({ src: imgTitle , alt: imgAl
[13:26:05] <Edler> stefancrs_: i can't seem to imagine the problem, what's happening...
[13:26:06] <mplabs> does it make sense Edler?
[13:26:26] <Edler> EDK don't paste in channel, use jsfiddle or pastebin
[13:26:28] <EDK> I am sorry for pasting code on here
[13:26:47] <Edler> mplabs: you want to make an ajax communication to another port/host ?
[13:26:50] <EDK> Edler, can you please help me :(
[13:26:58] <Matias> yep, that's what I want
[13:27:12] <Matias> I know it's not possible directly though
[13:27:18] <stefancrs_> Edler: basically, I have a <form> tag, and then, within that, I have a formwrapper where I inject actual form fields using ajax, and the submit value changes
[13:27:19] <Edler> Matias: you need a proxy
[13:27:21] <Edler> or
[13:27:29] <Edler> if the other host supports jsonP
[13:27:29] <EDK> I want to load external script which is embeded the live streaming code
[13:27:33] <Edler> then you could on client side
[13:27:45] <Matias> but I can't use a proxy, Apache doesn't like long polling request :P
[13:27:47] <Edler> the submit value changes ?
[13:27:48] <stefancrs_> Edler: but I mean, checking for that specific submit button id is no biggie, in the handler. is it bad somehow to do so?
[13:27:51] <Matias> ok, I will chank your second idea, thank you
[13:27:56] <Matias> check*
[13:28:06] <EDK> and i want to display it on the big image after someone will click on big image http://www.samirayousefi.com/slider/
[13:28:12] <stefancrs_> Edler: yeah, and the id of the submit button changes when the form content changes
[13:28:15] <Edler> no, it it works i don't see the problem
[13:28:22] <stefancrs_> cool :) thanks
[13:28:29] <Edler> Matias: is the 2nd server yours ?
[13:28:37] <tman> ah .id
[13:28:38] <Matias> yes, sure
[13:28:40] * tman looks that up
[13:28:53] <Edler> then you could code a jsonp generator
[13:29:01] <Edler> that way you can ajax/cross domain
[13:29:31] <EDK> I want to load external script which is embeded the live streaming code
[13:29:35] <EDK> and i want to display it on the big image after someone will click on big image http://www.samirayousefi.com/slider/
[13:29:39] <Matias> I will check what it is, my webservice is already returning JSON
[13:29:55] <EDK> please help me
[13:29:55] <Edler> JSON only allows on the host/port
[13:30:06] <Edler> Matias: you need JSONP
[13:30:06] <Edler> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[13:30:20] <Edler> JSONP or "JSON with padding" is a complement to the base JSON data format, a pattern of usage that allows a page to request data from a server in a different domain
[13:30:21] <Matias> I'm there, thank you
[13:30:31] <djQuery> EDK: have you seen anythingslidder? it can handle video
[13:30:44] <EDK> yes.. i tried it
[13:30:58] <djQuery> http://css-tricks.com/anythingslider-jquery-plugin/
[13:31:11] <EDK> but i want to make something like as http://superleagueformula.com/
[13:31:20] <EDK> there are some videos
[13:31:38] <EDK> and on the big side of image, when you click on it
[13:31:47] <EDK> you may watch video
[13:31:55] <EDK> i also want to make it
[13:31:58] <hiryu`> hello
[13:32:53] <djQuery> edk seems pretty easy
[13:32:58] <EDK> how?
[13:33:14] <EDK> but this is flash staff
[13:33:16] <djQuery> EDK: do you not have anywahere to start from or what?
[13:33:21] <EDK> and i want to make it in jquery
[13:33:38] <jrockjiggz> EDK - are you looking to insert flash with js?
[13:33:41] <EDK> yes, i have ... http://www.samirayousefi.com/slider/
[13:33:50] <djQuery> EDK: so what ur saying is that you have no idea where to start
[13:33:58] <EDK> i even have external livestreaming script
[13:34:12] <EDK> i am toally confused
[13:34:20] <EDK> after tried many plugins
[13:34:22] <EDK> :(
[13:34:55] <EDK> i dont know how to load this external script and applet on my code http://www.samirayousefi.com/slider/
[13:35:31] <djQuery> first off stop using $(this) 5 times in the same function
[13:36:13] <Edler> djQuery: what's wrong with $(this)
[13:36:13] <EDK> ok, so what should i use instead of this $(this)
[13:36:13] <Edler> ?
[13:36:14] <djQuery> $this= $(this), imgAlt = $this.find('img').attr('alt'), etc...
[13:36:23] <Edler> ah alright
[13:36:24] <Edler> yup
[13:36:28] <Edler> performance
[13:37:51] <djQuery> edk  .hover(function(){$(this).toggleClass('hover');});
[13:37:56] <stefancrs_> hm, shouldn't $("#submitbooktime").length be 1 if there's one input tag with that id?
[13:38:19] <djQuery> stefancrs_: yes if there is 1
[13:38:23] <stefancrs_> wth
[13:38:24] <EDK> do i need to use this instead of $(this)
[13:38:35] <Edler> no you should use $(this)
[13:38:39] <Edler> but instead of calling it everytime
[13:38:54] <Edler> you can store it in a varaible, and call that variable whatever you want (you can call it $this)
[13:38:57] <djQuery> EDK: no just cache it so that you dont have to call $() on it constantly
[13:39:06] <EDK> ok
[13:39:09] <EDK> let me try
[13:39:24] <djQuery> but of course this doesnt anser your original q
[13:39:38] <EDK> ohhh
[13:39:47] <Aokaado> why the dollarsign
[13:39:58] <djQuery> just some pointers from lookin at it
[13:40:21] <stefancrs_> I like that I get this in my error console :)
[13:40:28] <stefancrs_> Fel: b is undefined KÃ¤llkodsfil: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js Rad: 16
[13:40:38] <EDK> i just want to enable hover over the loaded big image
[13:40:45] <djQuery> Aokaado: just a naming convention I use  you know that $ items are jquery objects
[13:40:53] <Aokaado> ait =)
[13:40:57] <EDK> and after clicking on it... user can watch video, applet, and so on
[13:40:58] <djQuery> and vars with no $ are standard objects
[13:41:15] <EDK> concept seems like very easy
[13:41:26] <EDK> but very hard to implement on jquery
[13:41:28] <EDK> :(
[13:42:26] <EDK> i have removed to $(this)
[13:42:34] <EDK> and still not loading anything :(
[13:42:34] <djQuery> EDK: you would just have some spot where u store which one is supposed to load which script. see ?.getscript
[13:42:35] <bot-t> EDK, jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[13:42:56] <EDK> but..
[13:43:20] <EDK> only need to know where can i put this getscript code for making it work
[13:43:27] <snover> ?tijnh @ EDK
[13:43:27] <bot-t> EDK, This is #jquery, notÂ #handholding.
[13:43:38] <snover> you do actually need to do some of the work yourself :)
[13:44:11] <EDK> sorry guys
[13:44:21] <snover> try using it yourself and then if you get stuck and canât figure it out, ask again
[13:44:22] <EDK> but i am beginer on it
[13:44:27] <Edler> yes we can see that
[13:44:27] <EDK> therefore, i want to know
[13:44:30] <Edler> but it's not a problem
[13:44:35] <Edler> you will learn
[13:44:47] <Edler> one of the good practices is to put your code inside the document ready function
[13:44:56] <Edler> so that it's executed once the document is ready
[13:44:57] <djQuery> EDK: u will learn a ton more from trying it ur self
[13:44:59] <EDK> :) thanks
[13:45:03] <EDK> i will
[13:45:07] <EDK> let me try
[13:45:20] <djQuery> EDK: have u read ?jqf
[13:45:36] <djQuery> edk see ?jqf
[13:45:37] <bot-t> jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[13:45:45] <EDK> nope
[13:46:39] <EDK> seems interesting
[13:46:45] <EDK> i am gonna to have a look
[13:46:50] <djQuery>  $(".image_thumb ul li").removeClass('active'); //Remove class of 'active' on all lists   ???????????????
[13:46:51] <Edler> EDK: you should
[13:47:05] <djQuery>  $(".image_thumb ul li.active").removeClass('active'); //Remove class of 'active' on all lists   !!!
[13:48:05] <EDK> ok
[13:48:39] <stefancrs_> hm, Edler, it doesn't seem like the delegate does what I expect it to
[13:49:03] <Edler> what's happening that shouldn't happen ?
[13:49:11] <stefancrs_> I wrapped the form in a <div id="bookorcloseformwrapper">
[13:49:20] <stefancrs_> then I have <form id="bookorcloseform"
[13:49:22] <Edler> oww sorry
[13:49:28] <Edler> that won't work on a submit event
[13:49:31] <Edler> it will on click
[13:49:40] <Edler> sorry for that
[13:49:47] <Edler> but you should configure the submit event on the <form> tag
[13:49:50] <Edler> not the submit button
[13:49:51] <stefancrs_> ah. hm. but I need to fetch the actual submit
[13:50:00] <stefancrs_> and I did do it on the form tag :)
[13:50:08] <Edler> or the click on the button
[13:50:21] <stefancrs_> better to do it on submit, people might use the enter key
[13:50:34] <Edler> yup exactly
[13:50:40] <Edler> so what's the problem again ?
[13:50:48] <stefancrs_> but then I needed a way to make sure I didn't add the handler more than once
[13:50:51] <EDK> djQuery .. I am sure i cant do it
[13:50:56] <stefancrs_> that was how this whole thing started :)
[13:50:57] <EDK> becoz i need to study it alot
[13:51:05] <EDK> then i can able to do it
[13:51:15] <EDK> i think i should leave this stuff
[13:51:21] <EDK> :(
[13:51:23] <stefancrs_> now I know how to use delegate for OTHER things though, so that's cool :)
[13:51:24] <Edler> why would you add it more than once ?
[13:51:40] <stefancrs_> Edler: it gets added when the form changes due to ajax stuff
[13:51:46] <stefancrs_> or, well
[13:51:47] <stefancrs_> actually
[13:51:52] <stefancrs_> since the form tag stays the same
[13:51:53] <EDK> thaks to all
[13:51:57] <stefancrs_> I don't have to do that
[13:52:10] <djQuery> EDK: thats the thing about self fullfilling prophecies
[13:52:12] <Edler> EDK: you need to learn and try
[13:52:19] <Edler> no other way
[13:52:29] <Edler> stefancrs_: exactly
[13:52:45] <stefancrs_> imo, he doesn't _need_ to learn. there are lots of things we don't know how to do, but others do :)
[13:52:54] <stefancrs_> if he WANTS to learn though...
[13:53:07] <stefancrs_> or, well, need to to provide for his family or whatever
[13:53:15] <Edler> heh
[13:53:57] <stefancrs_> I just started doing this jquery thing, been mainly a php guy before. but when freelancing, doing it all helps :)
[13:54:14] <Edler> of course, frontend is as important as backend
[13:55:32] <stefancrs_> Edler: yeah, but I don't HAVE to know how to do it, I could hire people
[13:55:45] <stefancrs_> and just have some basic understanding of what it is that they do
[13:55:49] <Edler> even if you subcontract
[13:55:50] <Edler> yup
[13:55:54] <Edler> you must know what they are doing
[13:55:57] <Edler> or they'll rip you off :P
[13:56:08] <stefancrs_> I doubt that actually
[13:56:09] <Edler> that's what i do most of the time
[13:56:17] <stefancrs_> good devs don't rip people off in my experience
[13:56:19] <stefancrs_> oh
[13:56:20] <stefancrs_> snap
[13:56:21] <stefancrs_> sorry
[13:56:26] <stefancrs_> didn't mean to call you a bad dev
[13:56:27] <stefancrs_> :)
[13:56:31] <Edler> no no
[13:56:32] <Edler> lol
[13:56:35] <Edler> not talkin about that
[13:56:40] <tmayr> stefancrs_: good devs are expensive too ;P
[13:56:41] <Edler> just talkin about subcontracting
[13:56:47] <Edler> and knowing what they do
[13:56:49] <Edler> so they won't rip me off
[13:57:04] <stefancrs_> ok, now the handler works the way I want it too
[13:57:10] <Edler> great
[13:57:15] <Edler> but you can rip off ignorant clients
[13:57:17] <Edler> that's your job
[13:57:18] <Edler> hehe
[13:57:22] <stefancrs_> tmayr: again, not in my experience. cheaper devs are usually more expensive.
[13:57:54] <Edler> last month, a company paid my company 375$ for a twitter account *:)*
[13:58:04] <tmayr> well, you get what you pay for, in the long run, yeah definetely
[13:58:12] <stefancrs_> Edler: haha awesome
[13:58:24] <Edler> it's cause they have no idea how to create a twitter account
[13:58:25] <Edler> if they did
[13:58:30] <stefancrs_> I charge a higher fee just to not get bad clients
[13:58:31] <Edler> my company wouldn't be able to rip them off
[13:58:41] <tmayr> stefancrs_: sadly i learnt that the hard way ._.
[13:58:42] <stefancrs_> and to get rich, of course
[13:58:49] <stefancrs_> tmayr: bad clients? :)
[13:58:54] <hiryu`> http://dpaste.com/548012, what is the right way for use deferred in my _callback ? Please help me :)
[13:58:54] <Edler> yeah
[13:58:55] <tmayr> yes, for being cheap ._.
[13:58:57] <Edler> some clients are pain in hte ass
[13:59:09] <stefancrs_> not the ones who doesn't think your rate isn't an issue
[13:59:16] <stefancrs_> I prefer getting half the clients for double the price
[13:59:31] <Edler> yes that's what i do
[13:59:34] <stefancrs_> you get clients who actually care about their projects, not just about their money
[13:59:35] <Edler> in my company
[13:59:44] <Edler> i don't do any project, no matter how small it is, for less than 1200$
[13:59:44] <tmayr> exactly
[13:59:52] <Edler> even if it's a 3 html pages static website
[14:00:00] <tmayr> im still stuck on this project, for months, for which i charged, or rather accepted, very little money
[14:00:03] <Edler> but i will charge 5000-150000 if it gets complex
[14:00:13] <Edler> tmayr: i learnt that the hard way to
[14:00:16] <felo> Edler: what are the minimum elements to have a success ajax request, to send a variable to the server?
[14:00:21] <tmayr> i guess we all have to go through that
[14:00:26] <Edler> ajax ? GET or POST ?
[14:00:36] <Edler> what i ended up doing, was dropping the project
[14:00:37] <felo> POST
[14:00:42] <tmayr> i didnt give it much importance, other than "ok never being cheap again!"
[14:00:45] <Edler> you just need the url you're posting too
[14:00:49] <Edler> the object you wanna post
[14:00:53] <felo> aja
[14:00:56] <Edler> and optionally, a callback function when it succeeds
[14:01:03] <Edler> $.post(...
[14:01:04] <ShawnRisk> stackoverflow: hi
[14:01:21] <felo> ok, do I need the success element
[14:01:30] <Edler> what's the success ?
[14:01:32] <Edler> it goes like this
[14:01:44] <tmayr> Edler: 5000 to 150000? thats a lot of money, what kind of projects do are you involved in?
[14:01:44] <felo> ok
[14:01:52] <Edler> $.post('myUrl', myObject, function(data){alert('success');});
[14:02:03] <Edler> like right now involved in a project
[14:02:03] <mav_> hi guys
[14:02:07] <Edler> pdf generation
[14:02:16] <Edler> accoutn system
[14:02:16] <felo> Thanks Elder
[14:02:19] <Edler> payment
[14:02:26] <Edler> ajax based
[14:02:34] <Edler> massive emails
[14:02:37] <tmayr> and how much are you charging for that? if i may ask of course
[14:02:37] <Edler> many complex elements

[14:02:52] <tmayr> awesome
[14:03:04] <Edler> of course: + 500$/month ;)
[14:03:09] <Edler> (maintenance + hosting)
[14:03:13] <Edler> (and backup)
[14:04:01] <Edler> you must never let a client slip away after you're done with him
[14:04:09] <Edler> find something to keep charging him every month
[14:04:26] <devil2005> im having trouble with this hover event, it isnt working in my jsfiddle and im not sure why, it works on my site, however my problem is that when IE 6/7 view the page they get the "error script on page - continue running scripts on this page?" yes/no dialog box. does anyone jnow why this is? http://jsfiddle.net/z4YHf/
[14:05:06] <tmayr> Edler: will keep that in mind hah
[14:06:18] <djQuery> Edler: in my experience the ones that expect cheap also want the world for thier 25 cent
[14:06:24] <Edler> devil2005: now it works http://jsfiddle.net/z4YHf/4/
[14:06:35] <Edler> djQuery: yes that's why i never give low rates
[14:06:56] <Edler> plus working as a company gives you the power to charge more
[14:07:29] <devil2005> Edler:  yes i forgot to change it in jsfiddle the sselector, but how come i get the continue running scripts dialogue in IE 6/7 ?
[14:07:47] <Edler> can you get more detail from IE ?
[14:08:12] <tmayr> im quite sure IE is reaking out because o that comma in the animate
[14:08:12] <tmayr> try
[14:08:13] <tmayr> http://jsfiddle.net/TmAGY/
[14:08:18] <devil2005> ok
[14:08:22] <tmayr> freaking*
[14:08:28] <Edler> heh
[14:08:31] <Edler> could be
[14:08:33] <Edler> it's invalid syntax
[14:08:37] <tmayr> yeah, IE and FFX are quite picky on that
[14:08:43] <tmayr> learnt that the hard way
[14:08:58] <Edler> exactly
[14:08:59] <Edler> Problem at line 7 character 20: Unexpected ','.
[14:09:10] <Edler> also please
[14:09:18] <Edler> devil2005: don't put global variables
[14:09:20] <Edler> use var everywhere
[14:09:26] <Edler> var $contactformoridwidth = $contactform.width();
[14:09:59] <tmayr> Edler: why?
[14:10:19] <devil2005> ahh its wokring , the comma . IE is scrupulous
[14:10:24] <devil2005> thank you
[14:10:31] <tmayr> actually IE is right, Chrome is spoiling you
[14:10:32] <tmayr> :P
[14:10:42] <Edler> tmayr: spoiling, lol
[14:10:47] <tmayr> x)
[14:10:59] <Edler> tmayr: it's a good practice to not use global variables
[14:11:43] <tmayr> i see
[14:12:10] <Edler> if you assign to a variable inside the function
[14:12:14] <devil2005> edler, how did you get the error from IE?
[14:12:18] <Edler> and it wasn't declared with var inside that function
[14:12:27] <tmayr> devil2005: ie has a debugger, believe it or not!
[14:12:30] <Edler> it will overwrite the same variable name outside the function
[14:12:42] <Edler> devil2005: i used http://www.jslint.com/
[14:12:54] <Edler> if your code passes in jslint, it will work everywhere
[14:13:08] <tmayr> "WARNING: JSLint will hurt your feelings.", haha
[14:13:13] <Edler> ;)
[14:13:16] <Edler> indeed
[14:13:39] <devil2005> :] thnkass
[14:13:48] <Edler> welcome
[14:15:47] <cdtank> how to disable certain items from being sortable..after you have already initad the .sortable method on a list?
[14:16:01] <felo> Edler http://jsfiddle.net/yJZe2/  this is not send the variable to the server do I still need to put the object in the Post request?
[14:16:23] <djQuery> Edler: have u seen jshint?
[14:16:29] <cdtank> in the init I know I can do items:"blah:not(not-blah)".. but is there any way I can modify this items list on the fly?
[14:16:34] <felo> Edler: http://jsfiddle.net/yJZe2/  this is not send the variable to the server do I still need to put the object in the Post request?
[14:16:49] <Edler> djQuery: is it like jslint ?
[14:16:57] <djQuery> Edler: more options
[14:16:58] <Edler> felo checking
[14:17:04] <felo> ok
[14:17:07] <Edler> no
[14:17:13] <cdtank> i tried returning false in the "start" method.. but it dod not workout
[14:17:13] <Edler> you're not posting any object
[14:17:15] <Edler> if you don't wanna post
[14:17:19] <Edler> use $.get instead of $.post
[14:17:50] <felo> Edler: even the form method="post"
[14:17:53] <Edler> wait
[14:17:54] <Edler> felo
[14:17:59] <Edler> don't write url:
[14:18:02] <Edler> wait lemme update it for you
[14:18:08] <felo> ok
[14:18:13] <Edler> http://jsfiddle.net/yJZe2/1/
[14:18:40] <Matias> should I return anything special from the jsonpCallback function? JQuery is executing the error handler. I'm still reading the documentation but I didn't see anything until now
[14:18:55] <djQuery> Edler: mootools?
[14:19:04] <Edler> no i'm just fixing his js code
[14:19:24] <Edler> Matias: you should have a get parameter in your url which is the function name you wanna return
[14:19:30] <djQuery> the fiddle was for mootools
[14:19:44] <Edler> ah didn't see that
[14:20:01] <Edler> Matias: so something like jsonp.php?myfunction=X
[14:20:14] <Edler> and you'll call your function the value of myFunction
[14:20:22] <Edler> in this case X({...});
[14:20:40] <Edler> when you're gonna use $.getJSON
[14:20:51] <Matias> I have: dataType: 'jsonp', jsnop: false, jsonpCallback: 'pingHandler', and it's calling pingHandler properly
[14:20:53] <Edler> instead of giving it a function name you're gonna put ?
[14:21:07] <Edler> why not use $.getJSON
[14:21:10] <Edler> so much simpler
[14:21:28] <phobia> anyone up for a challenge? lightbox only works once if data is passed as variable, but has no such issues if the data is used as argument in the function. http://jsfiddle.net/ektw3/15/ vs http://jsfiddle.net/ektw3/17/ (click the See screenshot link)
[14:21:30] <djQuery> Matias: see ?malsup ajaxform

[14:21:37] <Matias> because it's jsonp, not json (?)
[14:21:55] <Matias> let me check
[14:22:35] <Edler> it will work
[14:22:47] <Edler> so easy
[14:22:51] <Whirl3d> I am trying to automate my section menus using php to parse my html documents for anchor elements and return the value to be used by jquery to build my menu. Is there an easier way?
[14:23:19] <Edler> $.getJSON('http://...json.php?callback=?&param1=...', function(response){...})
[14:23:28] <Edler> with that url returning jsonp

[14:25:02] <ShawnRisk> I am using the jquery cycle plugin and want to have the slideshow stick on the first slide for 10 seconds after it has gone through all of the slides.
[14:25:13] <ShawnRisk> I have got it so it sticks on the slide the first time around
[14:25:19] <Edler> what's the link for the plugin
[14:25:20] <Edler> ?
[14:25:46] <Matias> I think I will read a good JQuery+JSONP example, maybe I should use what you just said Edler, thank you again guys!
[14:25:49] <djQuery> phobia: nevermind
[14:25:56] <Edler> Matias: gd luck
[14:27:24] <ShawnRisk> Edler: http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/
[14:27:43] <phobia> djQuery: hehe ok, *neverminding*. but yeah, it's so weird .. I don't understand how it can make difference if it's a variable passed to function or used directly
[14:27:59] <Whirl3d> djQuery, I think there's a misunderstanding...I have the menu that I want, I just want my customer to be able to drop a really simple html document (with h1, h2, and p dom elements) into a directory and have it automatically added to that section's menu. Rather than read the entire file in jquery, I though I could parse the data faster in php and return info where jquery could build the menu.
[14:28:30] <felo> Edler: I can test the $get becuase it is not slidingToggle can you check, first it is not hiding hide();   http://jsfiddle.net/yJZe2/1/

[14:36:07] <draginx> $(this).text() for some reason gives me all of the text from every option o-o
[14:36:38] <tmayr> draginx: you can do $(this).find('option:selected').text() i think
[14:36:51] <draginx> ah ok thanks, just weird how it would function like that O_o
[14:37:01] <tmayr> yeah i know, i havent found out a cleaner way to do it :/
[14:37:05] <ShawnRisk> Edler: any ideas?

[14:40:56] <draginx> nah w/e i just pasted
[14:41:17] <draginx> tmayr: you think that we're right on how the $(select) thing should work?
[14:41:24] <phobia> djQuery: ah .. hmm.. how could that be fixed?
[14:41:46] <tmayr> draginx: ive done it lik that in the past if i recall correctly
[14:41:58] <felo> tmayr: what happen with that line is getAttribute deprecated?>
[14:42:00] <draginx> tmayr: right it seems more intuitiveâ¦ might submit a ticket and see what they say
[14:42:27] <tmayr> draginx: thing is, technically it should be correct, as you're not changing the select itself, but the options within it
[14:42:39] <felo> draginx what you did that fixed it ?
[14:42:44] <felo> the slideToggle?
[14:42:46] <draginx> tmayr everything works fine when u take it out
[14:42:55] <draginx> felo: u had $.get{ its suppose to be $.get(
[14:43:05] <felo> hahha
[14:43:06] <felo> lol
[14:43:26] <draginx> tmayr: True, but .text() should be text and not the html dom >.>
[14:43:33] <draginx> idk just seems like an intuitive thing to do :P

[14:50:31] <eddiemonge> like shadowbox.js, which also needs work but is decent
[14:52:06] <phobia> I'll check it out, thanks :)
[14:55:41] <felo> tmqyr: still replyCommentID field name in the hidden input is coming out empty, I was wondering if the variable parentid is the one to use in the post variable to send the information value of data-commentid="" in the span tag to the server?

[15:03:08] <sdio> don't tell me I've been mistaken all along!
[15:03:11] <eddiemonge> felo your first a tag in the comment class needs a space before the style tag

[15:06:35] <Whirl3d> could it be that Windows Mobile 6 sucks wind?
[15:06:55] <eddiemonge> felo: what are you trying to do with this script? replyCommentId doesnt have a commentid attribute. Why are you using get in the slidetoggle callback function? what are you rying to do with parentid?
[15:07:05] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d +1
[15:08:26] <draginx> felo: var gettingid = document.getElementById('replyCommentId'); this should be var gettingid = document.getElementById('replyCommentID');
[15:09:16] <sunscreen> Whirl3d, quiet possibly
[15:09:48] <sunscreen> what incarnation/version of intercrap exploitation it has
[15:10:18] <draginx> felo: I also have zero idea what ur trying to do with var parentid..
[15:11:10] <eddiemonge> draginx: did you miss my response?
[15:11:54] <draginx> eddiemonge: yeah just letting him know he's batshit insane and needs to figure out what he wants or how to code O_o
[15:13:56] <sunscreen> Whirl3d,  i think i will just find the IE users agent of WM6 and refer them to 'fennec'
[15:14:30] <eddiemonge> sunscreen: and what popup are you talking about? jquery doesnt have a popup
[15:15:09] <sunscreen> well its jquery code that does popups  using .show/.hide/.css
[15:15:58] <eddiemonge> does wm6 browser even do js?
[15:16:40] <sunscreen> that company loves to commit some barbaric behavior :(
[15:25:02] <symaxian> How do I detect a change on a checkbox?
[15:25:27] <hiryu`> $('input').bind('change', callback) i think
[15:27:49] <eddiemonge> symaxian: click event
[15:28:07] <symaxian> Wasn't working
[15:28:26] <hiryu`> $.when( fn1(), fn2() ).then( callback, fallback) performs the callbacks in parallel, or before running the first and the second in succession?
[15:29:04] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts on my slideshow problem?
[15:35:55] <sunscreen> if you detected IE6 i think surely its reasonable to urge them upgrade to a remotely complaint web-kit browser ? if other puney little mobile device can run a web kit browser then a windows machine can damn well upgrade i dont care if its PII 266 with 128mb of ram
[15:36:54] <sunscreen> Pfft IE6 hanging round our web development ankles holding back the development of man kind

[15:55:28] <Code-Junky> *user
[15:56:33] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky hi
[15:56:33] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[15:56:41] <sunscreen> wow
[15:56:43] <muhoo> is there a quick way to create a button using jquery 1.5.1, without having to pull in 1.8 and the ui library and all that cruft?
[15:57:48] <Code-Junky> muhoo please explain further and i might be able to help you
[15:58:42] <muhoo> Code-Junky: i mean, something like this: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Button#options
[15:59:42] <muhoo> but, i don't need the whole ui library, and upgrading to 1.8. just want that button, and i don't mind having hand-made css and a few lines of js to build it
[16:00:30] <Code-Junky> i think this is not applicable, or at least very hard to achieve
[16:00:52] <muhoo> isn't that just a div though?
[16:00:59] <Code-Junky> what you are trying (mixing) will only result in cr@p-cake :P
[16:01:55] <muhoo> heh
[16:02:08] <Code-Junky> and trust
[16:02:20] <Code-Junky> *and trust me it all get's messy afterwards
[16:14:14] <sarmiena_> can you use jQuery to auto resize the height of an iFrame?
[16:14:19] <aidan> Anyone know a neat plugin for sticky table headers? I want to scroll to the right and keep my <th>'s in the same spot
[16:14:29] <aidan> sarmiena_: sure
[16:15:27] <sarmiena_> aidan: all the examples i've seen result in error: Permission denied for <http://mysite.com> to get property HTMLDocument.body
[16:16:51] <sarmiena_> it tries to do something like iframe.height = iframe.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight
[16:17:32] <sarmiena_> aidan: i'm assuming browsers acted differently back when people did this. what solution can be used these days?
[16:18:18] <miketaylr> you need to use postMessage and tell the iframe's body to resize itself
[16:18:28] <aidan> sarmiena_: you're doing an $('iframe').height('200px').resize() and it's not working?
[16:18:34] <miketaylr> cause you're running into the same origin policy
[16:18:50] <sunscreen> can jquery do cross browser margin adjustment
[16:18:50] <sarmiena_> miketaylr: ah thanks. found an article about it.
[16:19:23] <devil2005> could please someone here invite me to forrst if they dont mind?
[16:19:29] <sarmiena_> aidan: the problem is that i don't have access to the iframe's content body to figure out the size i need
[16:20:02] <ZeuZ> To rewrite the whole thing(<head></head><body></body>) is it valid to use $(document).html() ?
[16:20:19] <aidan> sarmiena_: well that's a different story!
[16:20:35] <ZeuZ> Apparently not, as an answer to myself, but how can I do that?
[16:20:52] <sarmiena_> aidan: i see how my initial question was confusing
[16:21:01] <miketaylr> ZeuZ: what?
[16:21:31] <ZeuZ> miketaylr, change the contents from the whole thing, instead of the ones of a particular div
[16:21:45] <miketaylr> that sounds...weird
[16:21:46] <aidan> ZeuZ: why would you do that?
[16:21:46] <miketaylr> heh
[16:22:09] <ZeuZ> aidan, if it's possible, because I can and I'm trying stuff? :)
[16:22:15] <aidan> ZeuZ: $('html').html() perhaps, but if you take the <script> that loaded jquery out of the document ... I dunno. It's weird.
[16:22:48] <sarmiena_> miketaylr: don't think the postMessage will work. my iframe content isn't something i control. and it doesn't have the jQuery postMessage capabilities
[16:23:15] <miketaylr> postMessage isn't related to jQuery, but yeah...you need control of the iframe sarmiena_
[16:24:17] <miketaylr> ZeuZ: you should use pjax, it's sweet: https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
[16:24:44] <sarmiena_> i understand the reason for this behavior for a security standpoint. but it's funny that there isn't an easy way to deal with this since it's probably what we want to do most of the time
[16:24:59] <aidan> sarmiena_: security trumps
[16:25:07] <miketaylr> well...postMessage is the easy way to deal with it
[16:25:37] <miketaylr> if a 3rd party iframe wants to allow you to mess w/ it, it will allow postMessage
[16:25:41] <miketaylr> otherwise...
[16:26:00] <aidan> sarmiena_: why don't you have control of the inner frame? if this is your only solution then you'll have to use a proxy
[16:26:35] <tbranyen> miketaylr: pjax is sweet
[16:26:37] <miketaylr> go scrape some pages :P
[16:26:41] <sarmiena_> aidan: i just don't have access to it. :(

[16:44:24] <papyromancer> I'm just trying to verify that when the html5 video element is rewritten to flash on ie8 that the current time of the video (in flash) is progressing
[16:44:38] <papyromancer> and accesible from the javascript to flash bridge we've built
[16:45:07] <papyromancer> felo: is yours coming up with the java player, what browser?
[16:45:22] <felo> wait
[16:46:01] <felo> I think i have internet explorer 8 wait
[16:46:33] * papyromancer hangs his head in shame for making felo pull out ie8
[16:47:15] <felo> wait a second we have to hang the head of internet explorer which can not pull up
[16:47:23] <felo> my computer has a millions of virus
[16:47:42] <felo> i opened in chrome and it was rocking
[16:48:20] <felo> you are good for chrome but internet explorer sometime can be a bitch just like it is with CSS
[16:49:19] <papyromancer> you're going to get an error in ie8 just from pulling up jsFiddle, I think
[16:49:47] <papyromancer> but it's just something in th fiddle's app layout stuff
[16:50:52] <felo> it is working in your browser out of jsfiddle?
[16:51:37] <execution> any good web security experts (purely on an application level -- not talking about the server) want to try to break my jquery-/ajax-powered simple inventory website for some $$? i'll pay via freelancer. would have to give me some indication of your knowledge first.
[16:51:37] <papyromancer> felo: no, it behaves teh same out of jsfiddle: http://mwembed.lightcorp.net/tests/qunit/EmbedSources.html
[16:52:22] <papyromancer> but the jsfiddle version runs just a couple examples of the full test suite, so it's much faster---not to mention the sharability of jsfiddle
[16:52:29] <felo> what is the error?
[16:54:17] <papyromancer> it's something with the scope of variables being tested (set from the test setup and teardown methods)
[16:54:29] <papyromancer> variable is null
[16:54:34] <papyromancer> when it should be set
[16:55:20] <papyromancer> felo: you got me thinking on a solution, woot!
[16:55:43] <felo> really
[16:55:44] <felo> what ?
[16:55:44] <ShawnRisk> :)
[16:55:55] <gene_> Hi, does anyone know if anything in jQ/JS can provide the ability to report the "coordinates" a substring in a string? That is, returning a list tuple of the places where the replacements were to have happened (like [[6,17], [20,31]], meaning that the substrs consisting of characters 6-17 and 20-31 matched.
[16:56:12] <felo> papyromancer: what?
[16:56:20] <gene_> s/list tuple/jagged array/
[17:04:36] <sunscreen> has some one got native ie 6 available?
[17:07:52] <papyromancer> felo, I'm going to try some global variables to make sure they're in the scope of the setTimeots ;)  just to see what happens
[17:09:32] <felo> papyromancer: so it might be that internet explorer is not interpreting or catching those variables. Internet explorer the "different browser"
[17:09:51] <felo> let me know how those globals went
[17:23:40] <coldhead> god i am so cold and sexy
[17:24:00] <asadpakistani> how can u pause all animations
[17:25:47] <sdio> I believe there's a .delay function.
[17:25:55] <v0lksman> hey all!  I know this is a long shot but do any of you remember seeing a filtering (or re-sorting) type plugin that re-orders data with effects in real time?  the demo had a nice dark layout and colorful filter buttons...any ideas?
[17:25:57] <sdio> I'm not sure about the exact way it works, but that might be what you're looking for.
[17:26:27] <asadpakistani> sdio: i am using delay between animations, but i wana indefinately pause the animations on an hover
[17:27:47] <v0lksman> hahaha...that usually happens...ask and suddenly a search yields results: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
[17:30:03] <meosweetmeo> any ideas about how to emulate whole page zoom via jquery?
[17:31:31] <tbranyen> meosweetmeo: something with css
[17:34:22] <meosweetmeo> nope
[17:34:30] <meosweetmeo> i mean real page zoom
[17:34:37] <meosweetmeo> like ctrl+
[17:34:42] <meosweetmeo> not fontsize changing
[18:06:17] <justinTNT> ok, how bad is jqui these days? I haven't looked at it in over a year...
[18:07:27] <mindrape> justinTNT - you seem capable of testing it out yourself and drawing your own conclusion.
[18:08:00] <zjk> i guess jquery is just simply another js framework but one good
[18:08:02] <justinTNT> mindr*** : I'm itnerested in opinions
[18:08:09] <mindrape> why?
[18:08:31] <zjk> get this conclusion and hope it help as precise is you rask :D
[18:08:39] <mindrape> my opinion is you should rent your whole life, go to college, and work for a large corporation while running a side business.  also you should use jquery but not ui.  why does my opinion mean ANYTHING to you?
[18:08:58] <justinTNT> because we share an interest.
[18:08:59] <meosweetmeo> where can i talk about scriptculous.js ?
[18:09:01] <justinTNT> thanks for sharing
[18:09:29] <zjk> jquery is good but js is better
[18:09:36] <mindrape> justinTNT - we share a single interest in jquery that you know of so you're going to listen to every opinion and give it equal weight, eh?  brilliant.
[18:10:35] <zjk> on what kind of domains do you want opinions justinTNT  ?
[18:10:42] <justinTNT> zjk: jqui
[18:11:06] <zjk> js is so large and will go really far untill some browser supports come on
[18:11:15] <zjk> jquery ui ?
[18:11:33] <zjk> untill +> as
[18:12:27] <zjk> i just use effect package from jquery ui
[18:12:55] <zjk> other things are really not good enough for personnal advanced integration
[18:13:05] <justinTNT> *nod*
[18:13:28] <zjk> can you explain
[18:13:57] * mindrape uses jquery and jqueryui for a 100user/min site w a 40TB backend. No problems here.
[18:14:07] <zjk> i think that mindrape has the right thought thinking that youd' better test by yourself
[18:14:18] <zjk> one site one need
[18:14:47] <mindrape> if you're having issues making simple javascript scale then I think PEBKAC...
[18:14:47] <zjk> i don't discuss the jquery dev, just the integration ;)
[18:15:03] <zjk> jquery ui dev
[18:16:01] <zjk> justinTNT: you can use jquery ui before and if you find some deadend, do it by yourself
[18:16:34] <zjk> but ui has several really handy functionality in core
[18:16:50] <zjk> functionality +> functionalities
[18:17:13] <mindrape> zjk - out of curiousity.. how old are you?
[18:17:43] <zjk> 29
[18:18:07] <zjk> why ?
[18:18:20] <mindrape> i find that doubtful...
[18:18:38] <zjk> i'm not en nativ
[18:19:08] <zjk> why you say this ?
[18:19:29] <mindrape> then I'd ask if you're from either south america or india...
[18:19:33] <mindrape> cuz then it might make sense.
[18:19:38] <zjk> lol
[18:19:59] <zjk> try to speak another language and we will speak together at the same level :)
[18:20:10] <mindrape> speak Romanian?
[18:20:23] <zjk> no
[18:20:28] <zjk> that's your homeland ?
[18:20:31] <mindrape> nope
[18:20:43] <mindrape> USA = homeland... born and raised.
[18:20:52] <zjk> and dead
[18:20:52] <justinTNT> mindr***: that figures.
[18:22:09] <zjk> i have some many US ppl coming here and i'm pleased to here them trying to speak another language you know
[18:25:16] <zjk> if i'd welcome them pointing there lack of knowledge on local language i would better not speek
[18:25:25] <zjk> that's pointless this
[18:26:12] <mindrape> no idea what you're trying to say but cool beans.
[18:28:27] <zjk> i have many US ppl coming where i live (it's touristic), but i don't make fool on them because they don't speak well my language
[18:28:47] <zjk> that's better ?
[18:29:53] <mindrape> ah, that's fine.  I wasn't making fun of your language.  I was saying I was doubtful of your age based on a number of things you said.  But knowing you might be from south america or india = makes sense.  I work with people from Brazil, Argentina, and India all the time.
[18:30:13] <mindrape> it was what you typed, not how you typed it.  ;)
[18:31:56] <zjk> and what make the differences for you between ppl from a place from another ?
[18:33:08] <coldhead> zjk: people from some places are gypsies
[18:34:42] <zjk> and so ?
[18:34:57] <coldhead> so beware!
[18:35:50] <zjk> lol i fear about noob :)
[18:36:31] <psilo2> If I am not mistaken, gypsies have no souls and they'll put a curse on you
[18:38:19] <zjk> and where are you from you 3 ?
[18:39:07] <coldhead> i'll never tell, i don't want bands of gypsies showing up in village
[18:39:13] <zjk> holland +> psylo, coldhead +> ny
[18:39:22] <zjk> lol
[18:39:34] <zjk> i ear about nazis village in argentina also
[18:41:12] <zjk> that's too 100000000Â° ?
[18:42:42] <zjk> anyway if you want to be gypsies you can come here most home are free 3/4 of the year
[18:42:57] <zjk> i live in a ghost city
[18:46:49] <bambanx> sup guys
[18:47:09] <bambanx> anyone have a good example of magnifyng glass pls?
[18:50:22] <coldhead> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Magnifying-glass.jpg
[18:50:27] <coldhead> that's a basic plastic model
[18:51:32] <zjk> 1Â°
[18:51:58] <zjk> sure it's coldhead
[18:53:32] <bambanx> lol
[18:53:36] <bambanx> thx
[19:07:36] <Whirl3d> here's an easy one: if I am gathering all the h2 and h3 elements from a div using: $("h2","h3"), will my results be ordered such that all the h2's come first, then the h3's? Or h2, h3   h2, h3......?
[19:08:08] <ProLoser|Trmnl> anyone know what respond?
[19:08:11] <ProLoser|Trmnl> is
[19:11:23] <coldhead> i believe in old jQuery there was no guarantee, but now it might be in document order
[19:11:31] <coldhead> you really would have to read the source or try it and see
[19:12:28] <ProLoser|Trmnl> coldhead: are you talking to me?
[19:12:51] <coldhead> apparently not
[19:12:55] <coldhead> oh well
[19:13:01] <coldhead> i just want to be loved
[19:13:23] <abjorn> coldhead <3
[19:15:01] <coldhead> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/nkAW7/
[19:15:32] <coldhead> Whirl3d: and with jQuery "classic" http://jsfiddle.net/nkAW7/1/
[19:15:52] <coldhead> NOW WHERE IS THE MONEY YOU OWE ME
[19:15:57] <coldhead> sorry wrong window
[19:17:12] <abjorn> http://www.joystiq.com/2011/05/29/president-obama-gifted-the-witcher-2-from-polish-prime-minister/ lol wut
[19:19:26] <coldhead> ProLoser|Trmnl: did you ask a question?
[19:19:35] <coldhead> other than "anyone know what respond?"
[19:21:24] <ProLoser|Trmnl> coldhead: i was trying to figure out what the respond.js file is in boilerplate
[19:21:28] <ProLoser|Trmnl> but i just realized it's not jquery
[19:21:29] <zjk> when jquery will support websocket and schema change ?
[19:21:36] <zjk> (question for clodhead )
[19:22:00] <abjorn> clodhead
[19:22:13] <zjk> clodohead
[19:22:14] <coldhead> zjk: you can make it right now if you want, zjk https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[19:22:25] <zjk> sorry
[19:23:02] <zjk> i came upond backbone.js what do you think of the idea of chema change ?
[19:24:27] <zjk> the idea that when you change a scheme you can apply a an event on
[19:24:42] <coldhead> i thought you could use backbone with jquery?
[19:24:45] <zjk> like adding an object property, changing it
[19:25:07] <zjk> yes you can and it looks really good
[19:25:57] <zjk> my ask on websocket is that i eared that it wasn't applied in modern browser because of securities issues
[19:26:08] <zjk> anyway i found some js lib that handle it
[19:26:18] <zjk> so 'im a bit lost on this point
[19:26:49] <zjk> source websocket : http://jwebsocket.org/
[19:27:05] <Whirl3d> <--rummaging through my bank accounts to find money for coldhead....
[19:27:58] <zjk> and also do you know which delay will have any webgl implementation in modern browsers ?
[19:28:03] <zjk> :)
[19:29:33] <zjk> having jquery effect using webgl implementation would be like a dream
[19:29:51] <zjk> a start of a dream...
[19:30:24] <coldhead> it will probably be on most desktops very soon
[19:30:30] <zjk> cool
[19:30:38] <coldhead> but mobiles will lack it
[19:30:52] <zjk> jquery actually looks really well on android
[19:31:03] <zjk> for animate()
[19:31:19] <zjk> with another browser that the one by default
[19:31:19] <coldhead> yes but that isn't hardware accelerated
[19:31:24] <zjk> sure
[19:31:54] <zjk> do you know which browser's motor is used by default by android 1.5 phones ?
[19:32:10] <coldhead> mobile webkit probably
[19:32:22] <zjk> it looks better than on ff
[19:39:36] <zjk> coldhead: i was not young minded when saying that jquery ui is not really handy for integrating things
[19:41:21] <zjk> the way you can customize jquery ui is not really cool, i found jquery tpl way of making things, maybe this is implemented in jquery ui ?
[19:41:56] <coldhead> jquery is getting a template engine someday and when it does UI will probably use it
[19:42:07] <zjk> ok
[19:42:11] <coldhead> i don't use UI much
[19:42:22] <zjk> i used it on first projects
[19:42:28] <jrockjiggz> hey, how do i see what childrenNo current selection is?
[19:42:43] <zjk> each(i)
[19:42:58] <jrockjiggz> hmm
[19:43:03] <zjk> each(function(i))
[19:43:22] <jrockjiggz> i'm getting selection by using .parent()
[19:43:28] <jrockjiggz> which is a <td>
[19:43:45] <zjk> it get too complicated for me
[19:45:10] <jrockjiggz> index() is the trick, thanks
[19:46:10] <zjk> ok thanks for the info
[19:46:52] <coldhead> it get too complicated for me too
[19:47:42] <zjk> i love minimalist layouts
[19:48:49] <zjk> jquery + semantic = :p
[19:49:43] <zjk> just lack the YUI approach of loading extensions for avoiding conflict when dev. with many ppl
[19:49:59] <zjk> but still the best way for me to egt a result clean
[19:50:04] <zjk> egt +> get
[19:50:13] <systemfault> My only problem with jQuery is that damn stupid dollar sign $
[19:50:17] <systemfault> It's not PHP :'(
[19:50:30] <zjk> i never mix them
[19:50:36] <zjk> mvc
[19:50:58] <systemfault> Of course..
[19:50:59] <zjk> anyway i would go further on node.js
[19:51:08] <systemfault> node rocks :D
[19:51:10] <zjk> and forget about php
[19:51:32] <zjk> (but still have really good designs patterns in php)
[19:52:02] <systemfault> PHP supports "classical OOP"
[19:52:07] <systemfault> Not JS :P
[19:52:24] <systemfault> So yeah.. JS is usually more difficult to work with at the beginning
[19:52:51] <systemfault> I use jQuery for my personal projects but YUI3 at work
[19:53:20] <coldhead> life is too short to talk about PHP in jquery
[19:53:48] <enerel> i think all PHP developers use jQuery
[19:54:59] <coldhead> fascinating
[19:55:42] <enerel> yesterday i lost my wallet when i was watching RIO
[19:56:00] <coldhead> you think gypsies stole it?
[19:56:24] <enerel> :p
[19:56:30] <enerel> i left it
[19:56:43] <coldhead> that is very sad
[19:56:55] <coldhead> i am sorry for your loss, enerel
[19:57:05] <enerel> yeah ty
[19:58:58] <systemfault> Why does the first argument of a .each() closure the index? Isn't that a weird design decision?
[20:01:54] <systemfault> Ah right.. the second arg is redundant because of "this"
[20:01:57] <systemfault> Thanks anyway..
[20:07:17] <Edler2> someone nickname Edler is impersonating me right now
[20:09:06] <zjk> coldhead : are you dev server side on python ?
[20:09:38] <coldhead> no
[20:09:53] <djQuery>  take a lost wallet seriously. I lost mine once and it would up costing me 3 days in old county
[20:10:04] <djQuery> enerel: ^^^^
[20:10:29] <tehOPEologist> hm, seems like everyone in #css is dead, so i guess i'll ask here..
[20:10:31] <enerel> coldhead seriuosly what do you do?
[20:10:33] <tehOPEologist> for some reason the middle div on my homepage isn't going all the way down (the bg) like the other two divs beside it..  can someone help me figure it out?  it's driving me nuts!  >_<  http://www.xecorporation.net/vision360
[20:10:41] <zjk> coldhead : so what are you using server side ?
[20:10:45] <Edler2> yup #css takes about 1 hour to get a questio nanswered
[20:10:53] <tehOPEologist> lol
[20:12:56] <zjk> tehOPEologist: your site looks nice
[20:13:01] <tehOPEologist> thanks
[20:13:07] <KingDosser> Best autosuggest plugin for jQuery?
[20:13:14] <Edler2> what's tehOPEologist's site ?
[20:13:19] <tehOPEologist> just can't figure out how the eff this middle div is messing up!
[20:13:20] <tehOPEologist> >_<
[20:13:23] <zjk> many submenu are not working
[20:13:33] <fallingmeat> hey does anyone here use coda slider?
[20:13:33] <tehOPEologist> yeah, i just started it
[20:13:36] <tehOPEologist> nothing works
[20:13:49] <tehOPEologist> just creating a placeholder site and then filling in the php/links later
[20:13:53] <zjk> i prefer the top than the bottom :)
[20:13:56] <fallingmeat> wanted to see if anyone else had an issue with it automatically sliding without the interval time
[20:14:17] <fallingmeat> ie slide flips continuously without pausing
[20:15:50] <coldhead> zjk: i don't do serverside
[20:16:03] <justinTNT> hey fm, I use coda slider
[20:16:30] <zjk> coldhead : looks like having a frontside dev sit is better now
[20:16:46] <justinTNT> haven't had that problem; the problem I had was that it kept sliding after you clikced play on an embedded youtube clip
[20:17:06] <fallingmeat> ok, weird
[20:17:26] <fallingmeat> I guess time to try a new slider
[20:17:33] <fallingmeat> or just build it
[20:17:33] <justinTNT> paste your code?
[20:17:59] <fallingmeat> probably not worth it, just a call. I think it must be some external issue
[20:18:22] <jrockjiggz> parseInt( $('input').val() ) is always NaN even if I type a number - any ideas?
[20:19:26] <Edler2> that shouldn't happen
[20:19:36] <Edler2> are you sure it's a number ?
[20:19:42] <Edler2> try it on jsfiddle
[20:20:35] <djQuery> csstricks.com anythingslider works pretty good with video
[20:22:00] <Edler2> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/rtDLw/
[20:22:06] <jrockjiggz> Edler: yes i always get typeof as string
[20:22:16] <Edler2> yes the typeof is string
[20:22:26] <Edler2> but parseInt parses the string into an integer (number)
[20:22:31] <Edler2> check the jsfiddle
[20:22:33] <Edler2> http://jsfiddle.net/rtDLw/
[20:23:08] <jrockjiggz> Edler: hmm, i can only think your example works because you are calling a function?  this is mine http://jsfiddle.net/qLW7G/
[20:23:20] <Edler2> 1 sec checking
[20:23:35] <Edler2> jrockjiggz: the typeof the value will always be string
[20:23:45] <Edler2> but parseInt of that value will return a number
[20:23:49] <Edler2> lemme show you how
[20:24:13] <Edler2> http://jsfiddle.net/qLW7G/1/
[20:24:24] <Edler2> now you get number :)
[20:25:07] <djQuery> <inputÂ type='number'Â id='mytext'Â />
[20:25:27] <Edler2> yes but that's html5
[20:25:28] <djQuery> still .val() will return a string though
[20:25:33] <Edler2> exactly
[20:25:38] <Edler2> values are always numbers
[20:25:41] <Edler2> i mean
[20:25:42] <Edler2> strings
[20:25:47] <jrockjiggz> Edler: hold that thought ;)
[20:25:51] <djQuery> Edler2: so what html5 inputs work on all browsers
[20:25:55] <Edler2> even if you store a boolean in a json object, it will be stored as a string
[20:26:07] <Edler2> djQuery: do they work on IE6 ?
[20:26:30] <djQuery> if they dont recognize the type="whatever" they display as if it were type="text"   and yes they work on ie 6
[20:26:34] <Edler2> (about that boolean thing, not so sure)
[20:26:37] <Edler2> yes i know
[20:26:42] <Edler2> but then it wouldn't be type number
[20:26:45] <Edler2> it would just be type text
[20:26:52] <Edler2> but interesting thought
[20:26:57] <Edler2> works as a fallback
[20:27:00] <sdio> Edler2: re: the boolean, not true, I believe.
[20:27:08] <djQuery> but still gives u a better thing to write code against
[20:27:48] <asadpakistani> is there a way to achieve infinite delay
[20:27:49] <asadpakistani> ?
[20:27:55] <djQuery> lets u target fields better based on what tpe of input they are supposed to have
[20:28:41] <jrockjiggz> Edler: ok, this is what started this, i am trying to add numbers from multiple inputs http://jsfiddle.net/qLW7G/2/
[20:28:43] <djQuery> asadpakistani: jsut create a function that delays then calls itself
[20:29:10] <Edler2> jrockjiggz: that's not how you do it
[20:29:39] <sdio> Edler2: fyi, http://jsfiddle.net/qLW7G/
[20:31:26] <asadpakistani> djQuery: very genuis...is infitie reccursion taken as an infinite loop by all browsers...and also how can i reset the delay to 0. thanks
[20:31:59] <zjk> asadpakistani: some browser will alertr you with infinite recursion
[20:32:06] <zjk> that's stupid
[20:32:27] <djQuery> asadpakistani: set a var outside the recursion to test if still true inside the recursion
[20:32:46] <djQuery> asadpakistani: or just do a do while loop
[20:33:07] <zjk> asadpakistani: if you want a recursion that works well infinitely do it with asyncronism
[20:33:15] <asadpakistani> djQuery: k ill get to work..thanks guys
[20:33:23] <Edler2> hahaha
[20:33:23] <zjk> so that the client <+> server kepp the loop infinite
[20:33:31] <asadpakistani> zjk: what is asyncronism
[20:33:31] <Edler2> jrockjiggz: you forgot to initialise sum
[20:33:36] <zjk> wathever the client side browser
[20:33:40] <asadpakistani> zjk: like commet u mean

[20:34:10] <Justin_> I'm having a strange problem with the jscrollPane plugin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6172028/conflict-with-jscrollpane-plugin-and-css-for-an-overlayed-element
[20:34:19] <zjk> asadpakistani: $.ajax
[20:34:27] <Justin_> it's conflicting with some of the other elements on my page
[20:34:55] <asadpakistani> zjk: k...i am using infinite recursion for an animation, i am sure it will be a while before the stack gets overloaded
[20:35:19] <zjk> (if you need some server/client exchange while doing this if not it would be a dumb handshake
[20:35:33] <djQuery> asadpakistani: if ur jsut doing animation then jsut use a do while loop
[20:36:04] <asadpakistani> djQuery: what happens is that the animation on the stuff with the same class runs at once, and the animation on the other class runs at once
[20:36:12] <asadpakistani> djQuery: they dun que themselves one by one
[20:36:32] <asadpakistani> djQuery: so in the complete callback i call the function for the animation again
[20:36:58] <sdio> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/qLW7G/2/
[20:37:16] <Edler2> sdio: what was that ?

[20:37:35] <jrockjiggz> Edler2: your last one works great!
[20:37:40] <Edler2> yup
[20:37:42] <Edler2> it's logic

[20:38:02] <Edler2> ah sdio, you pasted 2 before, not 6

[20:42:38] <sdio> Say something directed my way?
[20:42:50] <Edler> just loling at the connection
[20:43:14] <sdio> It does choose inopportune moments to die.
[20:43:26] <Edler> networks aren't perfect afterall
[20:43:26] <da-beginner> hey all
[20:43:37] <Edler> anyone ever heard the jquery song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwId1ZHTaCU
[20:43:39] <da-beginner> what is the code to insert a div as the last child of another div?
[20:43:39] <sdio> I suspect it was a hint to stop helping the noobs.
[20:44:10] <Edler> $("#somediv").append('mycode');
[20:44:24] <da-beginner> thanks Edler :)
[20:44:29] <Edler> welcome
[20:46:12] <jrockjiggz> sdio: i said thanks ;)
[20:46:53] <jrockjiggz> cuz u said u were disconnected
[20:47:39] <jrockjiggz> oh wow..
[20:49:19] <Justin_> ughhh I'm getting this really weird conflict with jscrollpane... anyone familiar with the plugin?
[20:50:50] <iszak> ?ask @ Justin_
[20:50:51] <bot-t> Justin_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[20:51:21] <Edler> and paste it on jsfiddle or provide a link
[20:51:26] <iszak> there are no dumb questions, only dumb people.
[20:51:31] <iszak> haha I like that quote.
[20:51:46] <Edler> hahaha
[20:52:10] <iszak> nah but serioust Justin_, just ask i'm sure someone around would have (like myself)
[20:52:16] <iszak> s/serioust/seriously/
[20:52:33] <Justin_> ok so I'm using the jscrollpane plugin, I also have a dropdown menu with absolute positioning that falls over the divs with the classes that jscrollpane acts on, it seems that the elements in the dropdown menu that fall over these divs are rendered inactive: the css hover attribute and links just are not working
[20:52:33] <felo> if there are several iterations of an element why when click on an element other than the first one it seems like the first one to get affected even if user clicked other than the first one
[20:53:12] <Justin_> I'm wondering if there is a way around this, or if I'm going to have to change the position of the dropdown menu
[20:53:29] <Justin_> I can provide a jsfiddle if people think that will be helpful
[20:53:30] <iszak> Justin_, it's probably something to do with z-index'ing.
[20:53:30] <Edler> felo: jsfiddle/link
[20:53:35] <felo> http://jsfiddle.net/xysxD/22/
[20:53:46] <iszak> Justin_, that would be great if you could provide a jsfiddle.
[20:53:52] <Edler> felo: what should i do to see the problem ?
[20:54:00] <felo> SlideToggle
[20:54:05] <felo> the comment link
[20:54:23] <Edler> felo: i see the slidetoggle working perfectly...
[20:54:34] <sdio> stop spoonfeeding felo already. I bet more people here have written code for him than he has for himself!
[20:54:38] <felo> and you will see that the id of the other iterations will display in the button tag of the first one
[20:54:44] <sdio> mumble mumble, humbug.
[20:54:49] <Justin_> iszak: you were right, it was a z-index issue... thanks!
[20:54:55] <iszak> no problem!
[20:55:19] <Edler> well yes
[20:55:25] <Edler> you're doing  $('#replyCommentId').val(commentLink.data('commentid'));
[20:55:36] <Edler> you should scope it
[20:55:39] <tbranyen> sdio: so you'd prefer this channel to be dead?
[20:55:39] <sdio> "<felo> sdio please I am looking for references i am doing my homework ok "
[20:55:45] <felo> yes
[20:55:48] <tbranyen> oh lol
[20:55:49] <felo> this channel is to talk
[20:55:57] <tbranyen> yeah but not to do your homework for you
[20:56:02] <Edler> exactly
[20:56:04] <felo> thank you Elder
[20:56:53] <Edler> felo: there you go: http://jsfiddle.net/xysxD/23/

[20:57:31] <Justin_> ok so now I want to use jscrollpane to customize the outer scrollbar on the browser which is possible according to this demo: http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/fullpage_scroll.html   I copy and pasted this code into my application.js file: https://gist.github.com/998428  but still no luck. Is there anything I'm doing wrong/missing?
[20:57:45] <Edler> Justin_: did you debug it ?
[20:57:55] <iszak> Justin_, jsfiddle if you can
[20:58:52] <Edler> restarting pc, fucken windows 7
[20:59:06] <Justin_> I'm not sure what else to place into the fiddle besides the jquery? what html does it act on?
[20:59:29] <Justin_> oh woops
[20:59:30] <felo> Thanks Elder I will check the .parent() function
[20:59:33] <Justin_> never mind, i see where
[21:03:53] <Edler> BACK!
[21:04:07] <iszak> yay!
[21:04:14] <Edler> hehe
[21:22:11] <djQuery> <label for="fname">First Name</label><input type="text" name="fname" required />
[21:22:33] <djQuery> anyone gotten validation to take the label and generate the error message?
[21:27:33] <Edler> djQuery: label for works on name too ? i thought it was only for id
[21:27:40] <Edler> i could br wrong
[21:27:45] <Edler> be
[21:30:29] <jrockjiggz> i'm pretty sure its for id
[21:37:36] <felo> does the operators in javascript has the same functions as in php?
[21:41:45] <abjorn> felo: depends on which ones you're talking about
[21:42:00] <felo> the identical operator ===
[21:42:07] <felo> does it work the same in javascript?
[21:42:14] <felo> 1 === 1
[21:42:47] <abjorn> ?js 1 === 1
[21:42:48] <bot-t> abjorn: true
[21:42:55] <abjorn> ?js {} === {}
[21:42:56] <bot-t> abjorn: SyntaxError: syntax error
[21:43:00] <abjorn> oh my
[21:43:16] <abjorn> ?js var foo = {}; var bar = {}; foo === bar;
[21:43:16] <bot-t> abjorn: false
[21:43:23] <abjorn> anyways, yeah it should felo
[21:43:31] <felo> ok
[21:43:41] <felo> yes it didn't link me bot-t
[21:43:48] <felo> it came out false is ok
[21:43:52] <felo> it should work ok
[21:44:22] <felo> ok
[21:44:29] <felo> thanks
[21:46:33] <Tonamel> I'm having issues with jq not finding an element I've just created.
[21:49:11] <Tonamel> http://pastebin.com/Vk0fzLzs <-- I create a div, which works, but then jquery is certain it doesn't exist
[21:51:39] <Alexer> Tonamel, $jq('#' + meterID) ?
[21:52:10] <Tonamel> I would be that stupid, wouldn't I?
[21:53:04] <Tonamel> Yep, thanks.
[21:57:09] <jrockjiggz> so i have a task to to sum all inputs in a table column on each keypress. this involved using .each() and find('td').eq( indexNumber );  this is turning out to be quite slow... i can't think of a way to make this more efficient other than giving each td cell a unique ID
[21:57:51] <jrockjiggz> its not too bad...
[21:59:59] <sdio> jrockjiggz: cache?
[22:01:10] <Alexer> djQuery, thanks for the help last night. turns out the autocomplete menu ignores extra <li>'s (that don't have the "ui-menu-item" -class), like you suspected, so adding $('<li>footer</li>').appendTo($(event.target).autocomplete('widget')); to the open event handler did the trick :)
[22:06:01] <tehOPEologist> can someone help me get my nav working the way i'm trying to get it?  http://www.xecorporation.net/vision360
[22:09:00] <wkmanire> Howdy folks.
[22:11:37] <diegoviola> $("#state_selector") is null -- why do i get that if i have a <a> with id 'state_selector'
[22:12:34] <wkmanire> diegoviola: You shouldn't.  Something is definitely wrong there.
[22:12:49] <wkmanire> Do you get any other exceptions in your console?
[22:12:55] <wkmanire> Before this code executes that is.
[22:13:21] <diegoviola> no
[22:13:43] <wkmanire> Which version of jQuery are you using?
[22:14:20] <diegoviola>  * jQuery JavaScript Library v1.6
[22:14:30] <diegoviola> the app is also loading Prototype js
[22:14:43] <wkmanire> Try this: jQuery('#state_selector')
[22:18:11] <asadpakistani> is there a way to remove a preivously set delay?
[22:18:41] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: Are you talking about $.delay() or are you talking about a timeOut?
[22:18:57] <diegoviola> wkmanire: i don't get that empty error now, but if i do: jQuery('#state_selector').click(function(){ alert('hello world'); });
[22:19:00] <diegoviola> i won't see the alert
[22:19:02] <diegoviola> when i click
[22:19:28] <wkmanire> diegoviola: Does the anchor have its HREF attribute set?
[22:19:51] <dead> when using getJSON the CGI is returning 200 OK and returnin gthe expected JSON data (i can see this in firebug) yet getJSON is firing the ERROR event and errordata.responseText = the json (as a raw text) instead of the SUCCESS event
[22:19:53] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: $.delay()
[22:19:57] <diegoviola> wkmanire: yes, to a "#"
[22:20:35] <wkmanire> diegoviola: hmm. It should be working now.
[22:20:43] <wkmanire> Remove all other javascripts from the page except for jQuery and that line
[22:20:49] <wkmanire> lets see if you are getting a conflict.
[22:20:54] <diegoviola> ok
[22:21:05] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: I'm not sure right off hand. I'll check the docs.
[22:21:33] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: i am browsing
[22:21:51] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: No, there is no way to cancel the delay.
[22:22:07] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: "Â Because it is limitedâit doesn't, for example, offer a way to cancel the delayâ"
[22:22:12] <wkmanire> from docs
[22:22:25] <wkmanire> If you need to be able to cancel then you should use the setTimeout function and keep the returned ID.
[22:23:17] <wkmanire> dead: Try using the $.ajax() function. Add a handler for the error callback and check the textStatus argument for the problem.
[22:25:08] <diegoviola> wkmanire: lol stupid me, it wasn't a conflict with another lib, $(document).ready(function())
[22:25:17] <diegoviola> wkmanire: sorry i'm still new at this, thanks for the help.
[22:25:29] <diegoviola> i forgot to add that document.ready stuff
[22:25:32] <wkmanire> diegoviola: Ah, you were making the call before the DOM loaded. No problem.
[22:25:47] <diegoviola> yes
[22:26:03] <wkmanire> diegoviola: Remember you can also use the new syntax $(function() {  /* dom is ready */ });
[22:26:13] <diegoviola> i'll try removing all the prototype stuff from this anyway, i'll convert all to jquery
[22:26:22] <diegoviola> wkmanire: thanks
[22:26:27] <diegoviola> nice to know
[22:26:30] <wkmanire> welcome.
[22:27:00] <wkmanire> diegoviola: As a side note, a lot of libraries use the dollar sign ($) as a shortcut for document.getElementById.
[22:27:23] <wkmanire> diegoviola: jQuery has a no conflict mode you can use if you think there may be a conflict problem, you can also use jQuery by name as I showed you.
[22:27:28] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: k thanks
[22:27:42] <diegoviola> wkmanire: thanks
[22:28:00] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: i will have to call smaller delays in a loop and stop calling them when i need to i guess
[22:28:04] <diegoviola> wkmanire: using jQuery by name will alreayd do the noConflict() automatically or I have to specify it also?
[22:28:21] <diegoviola> already*
[22:29:35] <wkmanire> diegoviola: You want to specify no conflict mode that way jQuery doesn't break the other scripts.
[22:29:36] <diegoviola> i've seen code that does: j = jQuery.noConflict();
[22:29:38] <wkmanire> It can go both ways.
[22:29:43] <diegoviola> ok
[22:29:47] <diegoviola> thanks :)
[22:30:07] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: It might not be that hard to write your own cancelable delay function.
[22:31:16] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: Can I see an example of how you are using $.delay() that illustrates why you need to cancel it?
[22:31:19] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: hmmm just get the current time and run a blank while loop for that time, and break it when the times up or a global is changed?
[22:31:28] <asadpakistani> one sec
[22:32:10] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: The infinite loop idea seems like it would work, but you will find that it causes the browser to become unresponsive. You definitely don't want to do it that way.
[22:32:16] <dead> n dude im sorry but what is textStatus
[22:32:19] <dead> it doesnt seem to be valid
[22:32:41] <wkmanire> dead: Check the documentation for the error function callback signature for the ajax function.
[22:33:06] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: http://pastebin.com/n1mEFcir
[22:33:24] <wkmanire> look
[22:33:27] <wkmanire> looking*
[22:33:27] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: i need it around the hover
[22:34:11] <dead> oh you'r talking about statusText
[22:34:12] <dead> ok
[22:34:24] <wkmanire> dead: Sorry, sometimes backwards I get things.
[22:34:43] <asadpakistani> dead: cool nick
[22:35:00] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: So you want to do something only if the user hovers for a little while, but you want to cancel that if the user stops hovering before it happens.
[22:35:02] <wkmanire> is that correct?
[22:35:14] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: exactly sir
[22:35:37] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: stop all my animations when he/she hovers
[22:35:56] <wkmanire> How many animations will you be starting?
[22:36:09] <dead> wkmanire: no prob, i would've figured that out if ive been jquery for longer then a week :P
[22:36:10] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: then continue when they are done, ppl use clearInterval, but i have two animations going on, setInterval clearInterval is giving me issues
[22:36:15] <dead> use+
[22:36:38] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: 2
[22:36:57] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: a secondary then a primarey then a secondary and then a primary again
[22:36:57] <wkmanire> dead: You'll get it. jQuery gets easier once you see how it follows the same patterns everywhere.
[22:37:02] <dead> ahh ok im getting a parseerror
[22:37:14] <wkmanire> dead: Copy and paste your JSON into jsonlint.com
[22:37:19] <wkmanire> it will tell you what the problem is
[22:37:48] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: I'm not sure I understand everything you're trying to do but you can stop animations directly.
[22:38:04] <tehOPEologist> why is firebug saying my jquery function isn't defined?
[22:38:07] <wkmanire> I also think it would be more simple to use setTimeout here.
[22:38:09] <tehOPEologist> http://xecorporation.net/vision360/
[22:38:17] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: i dun wana stop while an animation is going on, but between them
[22:38:57] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: a delay is serving me well, its just when i move the mouse away it lasts its entire life
[22:39:10] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: In your hover function, instead of adding a delay, set a timeout and stick the returned id in $(this).data('timeoutId')
[22:39:26] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: On mouseOut you can get the ID from the data context and clearInterval o nit.
[22:39:28] <dead> wkmanire: nice link, thanks again
[22:39:29] <wkmanire> on it*
[22:39:56] <wkmanire> oops, clearTimeout
[22:40:02] <wkmanire> not clearInterval
[22:40:06] <tehOPEologist> anyone?
[22:40:25] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: Patience, he he. Right now it seems I am the only one fielding questions.
[22:40:31] <tehOPEologist> sorry, didn't know
[22:40:32] <tehOPEologist> <3
[22:41:12] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: more like var timeOut = setInterval(99999); $(this).data(timeOut); and on hover out clearInterval(timeOut); ???
[22:41:29] <wkmanire> why interval?
[22:41:34] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: please excuse me i just started usign javascript 2 days ago
[22:41:51] <wkmanire> Your code smells like Python. :)
[22:41:52] <wkmanire> am I right?
[22:42:04] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: that and php lol
[22:42:10] <wkmanire> he he he
[22:42:20] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: I see that you are pulling jQuery from the CDN.
[22:42:27] <asadpakistani> use timeout instead of setInterval?
[22:42:40] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: but you are not including jQuery before you try to use it.
[22:42:50] <asadpakistani> setTimeout*
[22:42:50] <wkmanire> move your script include for jQuery up to be the very first script tag in your head.
[22:42:50] <tehOPEologist> ?  i thought wordpress does that?
[22:42:56] <bot-t> tehOPEologist, 10 - Quick "plugin" to support animation of the CSS style.clip property via the jQuery.fn.animate() facility in the same vein as John Resig's jquery.color.js plugin. http://plugins.jquery.com/projects/plugins?page=9&keywords=&type=All&sort_by=title
[22:43:22] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: Yes, setTimeout returns an ID which you need to use in clearTimeout if you want to cancel it.
[22:43:46] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: var id = setTimeout(doThisLater, 1000); clearTimeout(id); // stop it from happening
[22:44:23] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: I'm not a wordpress expert :P I've actually never used it.
[22:44:55] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: gotcha and use a small delay in doThisLater?
[22:45:04] <wkmanire> Don't even bother with the delay()
[22:45:11] <tehOPEologist> i'm an idiot
[22:45:13] <tehOPEologist> sorry
[22:45:14] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: ima stop bugging ya and get experimenting,,,thanks
[22:45:22] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: No problem. Good luck.
[22:45:22] <tehOPEologist> thank you for reminding me of that, i fixed it :)
[22:45:30] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: ill need tht lol
[22:45:36] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: You're not an idiot. Keep on trucking.

[22:46:12] <sdio> unstoppable!
[22:46:16] <tehOPEologist> i have it set up so that once you roll over the explore image
[22:46:30] <tehOPEologist> a dropdown div appears
[22:46:47] <tehOPEologist> sec.
[22:46:48] <tehOPEologist> lol
[22:47:14] <tehOPEologist> k
[22:47:15] <wkmanire> sdio: :D
[22:47:23] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: What?
[22:47:31] <tehOPEologist> NOW i have it set up that a dropdown appears when you hover over explore in the main nav
[22:48:08] <tehOPEologist> but how should i go about making the dropdown stay so the person can get to it and the dropdown stay open if the cursor's inside the dropdown?
[22:49:20] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: THe problem is that you are showing the drop down when the mouse is over the word "explore" but hiding it when the mouse leaves. The drop down is appearing some 20 pixels below the text and so when you try to mouse over to it the drop down will disappear.
[22:49:48] <wkmanire> You need to add a delay that allows the user's mouse time to reach the drop down before you hide it.
[22:49:58] <tehOPEologist> mkay
[22:50:08] <wkmanire> Between 250 and 500 ms would be appropriate.
[22:51:22] <tehOPEologist> hm, where would i put the delay?
[22:51:32] <tehOPEologist> hit the refresh button to see my updated script
[22:52:09] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: That code will never work the way you have it.
[22:53:00] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: You need to seperate showing and hiding the div from the event handlers.
[22:53:44] <tehOPEologist> mkay
[22:54:43] <tehOPEologist> updated
[22:54:50] <tehOPEologist> now i make a seperate one to delay fadeout?
[22:55:34] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: Take a moment and think this through.
[22:56:15] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: When the user mouses over the explore text you should always show the menu. If the user mouses out you should wait maybe 500 ms then check to see if the mouse is inside of that div or not.
[22:56:26] <wkmanire> if it is, then do nothing, if it isn't then hide it.
[22:56:44] <wkmanire> On the explore drop down menu add a mouseOut event that always hides it.
[22:56:46] <tehOPEologist> i'm not really that great with if statements with jQuery yet..  =/
[22:57:00] <tehOPEologist> hit refresh, i added mouseout
[22:57:04] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: The if statement is not jQuery, it is javascript.
[22:57:18] <wkmanire> jQuery is just a helpful library that was written with javascript.
[22:57:21] <tehOPEologist> *javascript
[22:57:28] <tehOPEologist> i'm still getting the hang of them
[22:58:21] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: Ok, I'm feeling generous, I'll set up a jsFiddle with the solution for you. but I'm not doing any more of your work for you after that! :P
[22:58:53] <tehOPEologist> :-*  i love you
[22:59:02] <wkmanire> At least someone does.
[22:59:05] <tehOPEologist> i'm googling as much as i can to understand what i need to do
[22:59:06] <wkmanire> Give me 5 minutes
[22:59:08] <tehOPEologist> ok
[23:00:25] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: will jquery select psuedo class :hover?
[23:00:53] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: I'm not sure right off hand but I'm leaning towards yes.
[23:01:03] <wkmanire> Check the docs for psuedo class selectors.
[23:01:08] <asadpakistani> wkmanire: ill let u know after i try :)
[23:01:17] <wkmanire> asadpakistani: Thanks :)
[23:04:20] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: Almost ready

[23:05:51] <khurram> hi all
[23:06:50] <khurram> i am return from ajax   this   line  echo  json_encode( mysql_fetch_array( $result ) );   now at success: function i am getting an object how to decode it i dont know ?
[23:07:21] <khurram> i tried Jquery.parseJson( data ) but it is saying that the object returned is null ?
[23:08:09] <Tant102> khurram, have you looked at the output from that php-page? Does it look okay?
[23:08:53] <khurram> yes i do see response in firebug and that is a json_encoeded string  with all the data i want is in there in the response but my Jquery.parseJson is not giving me access ?
[23:09:50] <Tant102> Can you show us the generated json content?
[23:10:04] <Tant102> Preferably the url directly, or the json in a codepaste.
[23:10:17] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/csw5V/3/
[23:10:26] <wkmanire> there is a bug to be worked out but you can see what the code should look like
[23:10:32] <wkmanire> I put a lot of comments in there to help you understand.
[23:11:15] <tehOPEologist> mkay thank you :D
[23:11:25] <khurram> {"0":"1","uartist_id":"1","1":"P!nky B","uartist_name" .........
[23:11:33] <khurram> the above is a copy paste from firebug
[23:11:34] <Hierofant> Hey all.  I have a script which only works when I have console.log put in.  When I remove it, it doesn't do the right if-then conditional evaluations; the third option doesn't select properly:  http://pastebin.ca/2071887
[23:11:50] <Tant102> khurram, from ?parseJSON "Additionally if you pass in nothing, an empty string, null, or undefined, 'null' will be returned from parseJSON."
[23:12:06] <Tant102> khurram, check what your data variable contains.
[23:12:14] <khurram> how do i check ?
[23:12:24] <diegoviola> jQuery is a pleasure to work with. Thanks for all your help.
[23:14:16] <wkmanire> diegoviola: No problem.
[23:14:26] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: Now this is odd, I can't figure out why the fadeOut is failing
[23:15:07] <diegoviola> wkmanire: :)
[23:15:21] <khurram> Tant102: where r u ?
[23:16:26] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: This is a little better. http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/csw5V/5/
[23:16:55] <ZeuZ> Somehow javascript is messing up my HTML after login in, and also jQuery script itself is reporting an error in firebug, someone can help me look at it?
[23:17:47] <Alexer> Hierofant, well, frankly, the first thing you should do is to indent the code properly; as it is, there's not much chance of anyone understanding it
[23:17:56] <Hierofant> ok Alexer, thanks
[23:17:59] <mipo> Hi
[23:18:03] <Hierofant> will do now
[23:18:35] <Alexer> Hierofant, that said, i probably won't be around to help, but i'd say you have much better chance of someone other helping if they can actually read the code ;)
[23:19:03] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/csw5V/6/ there
[23:19:07] <wkmanire> that works just how you wanted it to
[23:19:12] <wkmanire> I was using $.delay wrong.
[23:19:20] <wkmanire> We really just needed to use a timeOut for this.
[23:19:55] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: Now, are you planning on copying and pasting this code once for each of your dropdowns?
[23:21:38] <wkmanire> tehOPEologist: If that is the case then use this final version. http://jsfiddle.net/wkmanire/csw5V/7/. Make sure to copy the outer function I used to protected the cancelHide variable for each dropdown.
[23:21:47] <wkmanire> protect*
[23:23:28] <ZeuZ> jQuery is having this error: http://pastebin.com/NPGZpXkJ
[23:23:33] <ZeuZ> it's in jquery.js itself
[23:23:35] <khurram> can i make the whole page fade a bit till i receive reply back from my ajax call ?
[23:23:37] <ZeuZ> what's happenin?
[23:23:45] <khurram> sorry how can i make the whole page fade a bit till i receive reply back from my ajax call ?
[23:25:22] <khurram> hello
[23:25:28] <khurram> coldhead: ?
[23:25:36] <khurram> ajpiano: ?
[23:26:52] <khurram> how to fade the body with whitish color till i my ajax response comes back ?
[23:29:56] <mindrape> khurram - $('#result').html('<img src="img/loading.gif">');
[23:29:56] <khurram> how to fade the body with whitish color till i my ajax response comes back ?
[23:30:08] <khurram> ah i c thanks for your reply
[23:30:17] <khurram> would that be a big transparent gif ?
[23:30:26] <khurram> all over my page ?
[23:30:38] <mindrape> then $.post('results.php', $('#form').serialize(), function(data) {
[23:31:08] <mindrape> $('#result').html(data);  });
[23:31:43] <mindrape> well you can use the jquery .show('slow'); feature to make it slowly come in and just set the div to a blank white background.
[23:31:46] <khurram> mindrape: should that be a big transparent gif with a whitist background ? to give a fade effect on the whole body ?
[23:32:03] <sdio> heh
[23:32:14] <khurram> thanks i try your suggestion
[23:32:18] <mindrape> $('#result').show('slow') will make it slowly fade in
[23:58:07] <darius_w> hi, i have something like class with methods "myMethod: function() {}" how can i get full list of methods defined it the class?
[23:58:42] <pilgo> Does the .class selector work for elements that you add class with .addClass to?
[23:58:47] <pilgo> It seems to not work for me.
[23:59:45] <coldhead> darius_w: console.log(obj) or possibly .dir(obj)
