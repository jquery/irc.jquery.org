[00:32:18] <balarka> hello
[02:01:04] <Tibelius> Yo!
[02:25:01] <Imaqtpie> Hey everyone, I'm having a really weird issue
[02:25:05] <Imaqtpie> https://jsfiddle.net/1fth7feq/
[02:25:19] <Imaqtpie> I'm using ES6 shorthand closures to get lexical this
[02:25:34] <Imaqtpie> After an ajax call, I do the following:
[02:25:39] <Imaqtpie> response.widgets.map((widget) => this.generateWidgetBox(widget));
[02:26:02] <Imaqtpie> It works on first try, but it stops working if I make the same call again
[02:26:25] <Imaqtpie> console.log(response.widgets) as an "object" but complains about not having the "map" method
[02:26:42] <Imaqtpie> Object {4: Object, 5: Object, 6: Object, 7: Object}
[02:26:42] <Imaqtpie> framework.min.js:1 Uncaught TypeError: c.map is not a function
[02:26:50] <Imaqtpie> Anyone knows what may cause this?
[03:53:14] <hendry> i am debugging a bloated web app and i noticed if I take _away_ jquery-migrate ... the scripts fail... Ummm, can this be the case?
[04:04:45] <hellyeah> jquery has All() or something else to get all values from an element? it can be multiple.
[06:01:11] <jstroem> purezen: and you start by doing $scope.carrier_object = {}; in your parent-controller?
[06:27:51] <gsc> Has anyone used select2 with json / ajax for the values but tried to prepopulate this with selected values? for example editing a entry which has multiple values set against it with select2 I want to prepopulate the already selected ones for editing
[06:28:12] <gsc> this wouldn't apply to creating or adding but I seem to be having issues setting the select2 values they don't appear
[06:40:06] <gsc> "initSelection" works but I can't do it outwith the initial select2 call and the initial call is used as a generic one across multiple pages so need to work out how to apply that to an existing select2 box
[06:47:40] <Clorith> Hiya, I've got two jQueyr noconflict wrappers in two different files, one has a function defined, the other tries to call the function. Now of course these are now in different scopes, so one will get an undefined error
[06:48:18] <Clorith> Is there any way to define a function outside the jQuery scope, but retain the jQuery noconflict call so that it can safely use $() calls ?
[06:52:06] <Clorith> Of course there is, just define the wrapper inside the function, major derp moment from me there
[06:58:59] <hellyeah> hey
[07:01:24] <hellyeah> lets say i create multiple element with same class
[07:01:34] <hellyeah> is there an easy way to get all values?
[07:06:23] <Omar-> hellyeah loop through them
[07:06:42] <Omar-> $.each()
[07:08:03] <hellyeah> Omar-:   can you check line 330 when i remove val() it gave me two .from element but when i add val() i can only get last value  http://jsfiddle.net/xz4ftbv4/3/
[07:10:28] <hellyeah> Omar-:  i forgot updating it http://jsfiddle.net/xz4ftbv4/4/
[07:11:50] <Omar-> ok
[07:15:27] <Omar-> hellyeah buttons are hidden, its difficult to debug all the code
[07:17:10] <Omar-> the fiddle isn't working
[07:17:15] <hellyeah> hmm Omar-  it is done just click + and you will see pencil button it is update button
[07:17:32] <hellyeah> Omar-:  http://jsfiddle.net/xz4ftbv4/5/
[07:21:10] <Omar-> hellyeah, okay now you have two input elements with .from, one of them is hidden and has no value.
[07:22:51] <hellyeah> Omar-:  create two elements
[07:22:59] <hellyeah> and select dates by clicking input box
[07:23:39] <Omar-> yup
[07:23:48] <Omar-> i'm getting this in console Array [ "09/03/2016", "11/03/2016" ] for two elements
[07:23:58] <Omar-> $('.from').not(":hidden").each
[07:24:12] <Omar-> to exculde hidden input elements
[07:24:16] <Omar-> hellyeah ^^
[07:26:37] <Omar-> hellyeah http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/xz4ftbv4/6/
[07:27:15] <hellyeah> Omar-:  thanks
[07:27:21] <Omar-> np
[07:56:52] <hellyeah> hey
[07:57:01] <hellyeah> .prop('id') right?
[08:30:18] <Arnsa> hello
[08:31:57] <Arnsa> https://jsfiddle.net/j97xz5tc/ how can I loop through these paths and change opacity of them?
[08:35:51] <sigdk> I can read the value of a text field like this: document.getElementById('foo').value shouldn't I be able to read it like this as well: $('foo').text()
[08:46:35] <Omar-> sigdk value and text are different
[08:46:37] <Arnsa> channel with 639 dead people
[08:46:42] <Arnsa> lol
[08:47:01] <sigdk> Omar-, value returns nothing either
[08:47:08] <Omar-> Arnsa I'm not experienced with SVG. your fiddle shows nothing, only g and path tags
[08:47:19] <Omar-> Arnsa try opacity attribute
[08:47:40] <Omar-> sigdk .val() = .value = value=""
[08:47:42] <Arnsa> Omar-, it doesn't matter. The thing is I need to loop through those path tags and change opacity of each of those. How can I loop through all of them?
[08:48:05] <Omar-> sigdk .text() returns string of children elements
[08:48:58] <Arnsa> Omar-, any ideas?
[08:48:59] <Omar-> Arnsa $("g path").each(function () { $(this).changeOpacity() });
[08:49:18] <Omar-> or changeOpacity(this)
[08:49:46] <Omar-> or function (index, element) { element.changeOpacity() });
[08:49:56] <Omar-> use $.each function
[08:50:12] <Omar-> !api each
[08:50:14] <sigdk> Omar-, .val() and .value return undefined
[08:50:29] <Omar-> sigdk what type of element are you using?
[08:50:43] <sigdk> text field of a form
[08:50:43] <Omar-> .value is JS, .val() is jQ
[08:50:51] <Arnsa> Omar-, Uncaught TypeError: $(...).each is not a function(Ö)
[08:51:09] <Omar-> sigdk input? $(".selector").val() should work
[08:51:26] <Omar-> Arnsa $.each("g path", func......
[08:52:19] <sigdk> Omar-, I was missing '#' at the beginning of the selector
[08:52:27] <Arnsa> Omar-, wrote it like that: $.each($(".loader path"), function () { $(this).css("opacity", "1"); });
[08:52:33] <Arnsa> Omar-, still got that error
[08:54:46] <Omar-> Arnsa https://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/j97xz5tc/3/
[08:55:50] <Arnsa> Omar-, lol, my JS was disabled... it's working, thanks!
[08:56:10] * Omar- shoots Arnsa
[08:56:23] <Arnsa> sorry lol
[08:56:27] <Omar-> !kick Arnsa
[08:56:28] <Omar-> ;)
[09:09:30] <Serizawa> Hey, could someone help me convert these few lines from JQuery to Javascript? http://pastebin.com/GugwkXHH
[09:10:54] <Uhkis> lol Serizawa
[09:11:02] <Serizawa> hey Uhkis
[09:11:12] <Serizawa> Wanna halp? xD
[09:12:25] <Uhkis> i think you're better off in ##javascript, this channel is for the other way around ;)
[09:13:29] <Uhkis> and why are you doing that?
[09:13:33] <Serizawa> True... Looking at that paste, how could I get that to look at the window.parent?
[09:14:10] <Serizawa> Don't know why, but CRM Dynamics doesn't allow that JQuery to work. The tabs don't change.
[09:14:26] <Uhkis> that's in an iframe?
[09:14:34] <Serizawa> Yeah.
[09:15:46] <Omar-> Serizawa because you need to delegate
[09:16:09] <Serizawa> Oh? Please explain; I know nothing about JQuery. heh.
[09:16:09] <Omar-> $(static parent).on("event", "dynamic elements", function
[09:16:57] <Serizawa> Where am I plopping that?
[09:17:17] <Uhkis> Omar-: why would he need delegation
[09:17:25] <Omar-> Serizawa http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[09:17:36] <Omar-> Uhkis he said elements are dynamic
[09:18:00] <Uhkis> i'm pretty sure CRM Dynamics is just the name of the system :P
[09:18:10] <Omar-> Uhkis lol, true?
[09:18:45] <Serizawa> Yeah, Microsoft CRM Dynamics. lol.
[09:18:58] <Omar-> :/
[09:19:03] <Omar-> my bad
[09:19:05] <Serizawa> So yeah, I'm using a web resource, aka IFrame.
[09:19:12] <Serizawa> to display the tabs
[09:19:37] <Serizawa> but that query isn't working, and I'm wondering if it's because it needs the window parent?
[09:19:49] <Serizawa> I'm not sure how jQuery works... why I wanna see it in Javascript. :P
[09:20:01] <Omar-> then ##javascript is what you need, as Uhkis has said.
[09:20:03] <Uhkis> Serizawa: do you have any errors in the console?
[09:20:09] <Serizawa> No errors in console.
[09:20:26] <Uhkis> Serizawa: is that dynamics behind ssl? (https) ?
[09:20:46] <Serizawa> Yes.
[09:21:14] <Uhkis> Serizawa: try changing that jquery include to https too
[09:21:31] <Uhkis> (the script src="..)
[09:21:52] <Serizawa> No idea what you mean.
[09:22:48] <Uhkis> Serizawa: line #1 and #22 in your paste
[09:23:45] <Serizawa> so do.. <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[09:24:23] <Uhkis> yes
[09:26:13] <Serizawa> Fact that that worked blows my mind.
[09:26:14] <Serizawa> lmfao.
[09:26:21] <Serizawa> You da man Uhkis
[09:27:56] <Uhkis> damn those browser security features! :D
[09:28:28] <Serizawa> This is why I won't ever be a web dev.
[09:29:58] <Uhkis> there really should've been mixed content loading blocked in your console though
[09:30:47] <Serizawa> Nuffink.
[09:56:00] <sharax> hi
[09:56:24] <sharax> i need translate function
[09:57:29] <sharax> for example : my lib 'en' => 'english','ru' => 'russia', 'ch' => 'china' and ...
[09:57:59] <sharax> replace from code
[10:03:01] <sharax> how to help me?!
[10:03:37] <decx> do it serverside, there helped
[10:08:57] <enerel> i have this kind of chat window which calls ajax to refresh on website, but when i go to different page i get error 404 file not found https://jsfiddle.net/m5uwn9LL/
[10:09:15] <enerel> if i put path it says cross domain error
[10:09:43] <enerel> sorry for my bad english
[10:11:41] <enerel> above script works on index.php etc but when put on folder like module/index.php it says 404 data_load.php
[10:15:08] <enerel> does my question clear?
[10:16:28] <enerel> anyone?
[10:20:31] <enerel> oh got it it just /data_load.php
[10:21:13] <enerel> the / is relative path
[10:21:36] <enerel> google is much faster
[10:45:18] <Trioxin> I'm trying to click a checkbox. Here's the dom code: http://storage6.static.itmages.com/i/16/0309/h_1457538272_1949515_d412183afd.png I tried this: $(".recaptcha-checkbox-checkmark").click();
[10:46:16] <Trioxin> I want to use https://2captcha.com/ but I need to check the box first
[10:46:49] <Trioxin> for blind people
[10:53:54] <decx> it's a div
[11:30:37] <claytonzaugg> I don't know how to ask this, so I hope this comes out correctly.  If I have a div where I need to make the image inside it absolute, how can I make the height of the div equal the height of the image, that will constantly be scaling?
[11:40:59] <decx> padding hack
[11:51:43] <jamesdrawneek> How do I stop a click function firing twice when there's a second trigger is inside of another? $(".tigger, .container-trigger").click...
[11:52:11] <decx> stop propagation
[11:52:21] <taplar> trigger the click on the dom element instead of the jquery object
[11:52:34] <jamesdrawneek> Will that stop it altogether? It's a toggle basically
[11:53:04] <taplar> are you saying you only want the handler to execute one at a time, or are you triggering the click inside the click?
[11:53:45] <sharax> how to see active option tag?!
[11:53:47] <decx> stop... in the name of ... propagation
[11:54:42] <jamesdrawneek> I have a container with a toggle button. I want to add the ability to click in the container to also trigger the toggle.
[11:55:04] <sharax> http://kopy.io/uhzl6
[11:55:12] <decx> jamesdrawneek: use a label
[11:55:18] <decx> no js required
[11:55:23] <taplar> yeah, so stop the propagation like decx said
[11:55:51] <jamesdrawneek> decx: I am actually. Label plus an input but that seems to break when adding jquery
[11:56:04] <decx> shouldnt
[11:57:04] <decx> if you already use a label then listen for change and not click
[11:58:12] <jamesdrawneek> decx: Ah so split into two listeners. One on the input and one on a click
[11:58:25] <decx> no
[12:07:18] <sharax> how to get active select option!?
[12:07:24] <flashpoint9> Im trying to add a class to the first A tag just inside a div, tried this  $('#side-bar-menu').closest('a').addClass('master-parent');
[12:08:55] <flashpoint9> its not working though, any ideas
[12:08:57] <flashpoint9> ?
[12:11:49] <flashpoint9> ah got it with this       $('#side-bar-menu a:first').addClass('master-parent');
[12:13:19] <jomofcw> Anyone using OWL Carousel 2 beta there, please ? I'm facing an "event is undefined" error in the callback, but I srsly can't understand why... here is my snippet : https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7d3d5fb6093480c02ecb
[12:15:54] <sharax> Friends anybody help me?
[12:17:47] <jamesdrawneek> Why does this break my input + label functionality?  $(".second-trigger").click(function(){  $('#input-toggle').prop('checked', false); })
[12:18:03] <jamesdrawneek> One seems to break the other?
[12:18:07] <sharax> http://kopy.io/oi4KL
[12:18:49] <William|i7> jamesdrawneek prop checked is diff then attr checked
[12:18:58] <sharax> I send the code below can be filtered through but only for a field
[12:19:03] <William|i7> could have something to do with it, if your check status matters
[12:19:25] <jamesdrawneek> William|i7: Ah thanks I'll take a look at that
[12:19:41] <William|i7> noticed that the other day when i did a checkall function with prop but was tryin to check the attr checked later
[12:19:49] <William|i7> had to be either or, use prop or use checked
[12:19:53] <William|i7> i mean attr
[12:23:03] <shoky> always use prop for 'checked'
[12:23:42] <jamesdrawneek> neither seem to work
[12:23:58] <jamesdrawneek> Seem to cancel each other out
[12:24:03] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[12:27:51] <jamesdrawneek> shoky: https://jsfiddle.net/5rkpjyg2/
[12:28:11] <jamesdrawneek> I've being going round in circles trying all sorts!
[12:28:30] <jamesdrawneek> Should be able to click the black rectangle to make it disappear
[12:30:03] <shoky> jamesdrawneek: .prop('checked', false)
[12:30:20] <sharax> please help :(
[12:30:34] <taplar> sharax: your paste is very large
[12:30:39] <taplar> make a smaller one that shows the issue
[12:30:45] <sharax> w8
[12:31:40] <jamesdrawneek> shoky: Didn't see that in the docs anywhere. Thought it was odd
[12:32:27] <robertmaxrees> sharax .find(':selected') probably.
[12:32:35] <jamesdrawneek> shoky: Hmm that still doesn't work
[12:32:36] <shoky> jamesdrawneek: didn't see what in the docs?
[12:32:41] <geri> hi decx
[12:32:56] <shoky> jamesdrawneek: what doesn't work? https://jsfiddle.net/5rkpjyg2/1/
[12:33:03] <jamesdrawneek> shoky: Eh it does in the fiddle
[12:35:14] <geri> decx: i tried the canvas trick you told me yesterday...but it draws the screen white: http://i.imgur.com/DzOncn6.png
[12:36:50] <jamesdrawneek> shoky: Ok sorry didn't get the paste right: https://jsfiddle.net/5rkpjyg2/2/
[12:37:06] <jamesdrawneek> shoky: So the input is actually hidden and it's controlled by the label
[12:37:52] <taplar> seems to work.  what's wrong?
[12:38:18] <shoky> clicking the label doesn't hide it
[12:38:41] <taplar> ah i was clicking on the box
[12:38:43] <shoky> jamesdrawneek: why make it a label?
[12:38:44] <jamesdrawneek> Seems to double fire or something
[12:38:51] <sharax> my optimize code
[12:38:55] <sharax> http://kopy.io/n8gYx
[12:38:59] <jamesdrawneek> So it works with no js :oD
[12:39:01] <sharax> my code is worked
[12:39:08] <sharax> but
[12:40:11] <sharax> before select "en" from "filter-lang" and after select "ny" from "filter-city"
[12:40:24] <robertmaxrees> sharax make a simplified fiddle of your problem.
[12:40:29] <sharax> only send filter-city
[12:40:37] <sharax> on post
[12:40:46] <decx> geri: play around with the globalcompositeoperation
[12:41:24] <sharax> I can not work with json from jsfiddle
[12:41:25] <sharax> :D
[12:41:51] <robertmaxrees> sharax i don't see what JSON has to do with your problem - you said you want the selected option in a dropdown.
[12:41:54] <shoky> jamesdrawneek: many ways to go about it.. here's one  https://jsfiddle.net/5rkpjyg2/3/
[12:42:46] <robertmaxrees> sharax are you trying to build something to send via $.post()?
[12:43:30] <sharax> yea send from post
[12:43:46] <robertmaxrees> sharax we can ignore the ajax part then - make a simplified fiddle of the rest.
[12:44:15] <decx> even with ajax you can always ajax echo and use dummy data
[12:44:19] <geri> decx: dont you think i made another mistake?
[12:44:28] <decx> geri:  impossible to tell
[12:44:41] <shoky> jamesdrawneek: here's another way https://jsfiddle.net/5rkpjyg2/4/
[12:45:51] <shoky> jamesdrawneek: and another ;p  https://jsfiddle.net/5rkpjyg2/5/
[12:47:20] <sharax> robertmaxrees Can I send site link?
[12:47:24] <taplar> sharax: https://jsfiddle.net/rvvk7tmg/  seems like there is a syncax error in the first block
[12:47:29] <taplar> syntax
[12:47:29] <robertmaxrees> sharax no.
[12:47:37] <robertmaxrees> sharax make a simplified fiddle of your problem.
[12:47:54] <shoky> jamesdrawneek: and here's a pure css way  https://jsfiddle.net/5rkpjyg2/6/
[12:47:57] <taplar> looks like there is an extra });
[12:48:11] <decx> apparently the o in shoky stands for all the options you get
[12:48:19] <shoky> lol
[12:49:49] <taplar> cmd> shoky --help
[12:50:01] <taplar> cmd> shoky [-o for all options]

[12:52:01] <taplar> cmd> taplar -joke
[12:52:03] <sharax> I could not run json
[12:52:08] <taplar> cmd> redundant, taplar is a joke
[12:52:57] <taplar> still looks like an extra }); at the end of the first block.  and missing the leading $
[12:53:08] <robertmaxrees> sharax you have a syntax error in there,  anyway, which line in here are you strigguling with?
[12:53:14] <decx> the options dont have ids
[12:53:24] <decx> and val is on the select
[12:53:25] <robertmaxrees> also: $(this).find('option:selected').val(); should just be $(this).val();
[12:53:49] <jamesdrawneek> shoky: Thanks for that. I've done it now. Had brain wave to just cover the block with the label
[12:54:00] <jamesdrawneek> Thanks guys! Was going slightly insane...
[12:54:01] <sharax> Runs correctly on my site
[12:54:11] <robertmaxrees> sharax we're showing the right way to do it.
[12:54:50] <decx> wait
[12:54:54] <decx> 'selected'
[12:54:55] <decx> wat
[12:55:49] <taplar> var button = $(this).val(); <-- that's not working
[12:55:51] <decx> gonna assume the first function is pointless
[12:56:12] <taplar> 'this' would be the doc ready callback
[12:56:30] <robertmaxrees> no guys sharax already said "Runs correctly on my site" so we don't need to help them any more ;)
[12:56:39] <decx> ah nice
[12:56:40] <taplar> true true
[12:56:42] <decx> feet up

[12:57:46] <sharax> See if the site I'm grateful

[12:58:25] <robertmaxrees> #nothanks
[12:58:36] <taplar> we can read syntax/logic errors in the code
[12:59:52] <taplar> just to keep poking the bear
[12:59:58] <taplar> var $value = $('selected').find('option:selected').val(); <-- 'selected' isn't a tag
[13:00:13] <taplar> afaik
[13:00:18] <robertmaxrees> nope.

[13:04:20] <taplar> ln 2-4 are still jacked up
[13:04:39] <robertmaxrees> $('selected').find('option:selected').val(); - just get the .val() of the dropdown
[13:04:43] <robertmaxrees> $('selected') isn't a thing.
[13:05:15] <taplar> ln 2 isn't even used
[13:06:07] <decx> what was it geri?
[13:07:40] <taplar> it'd also be better to give _name a class or id
[13:08:00] <taplar> but that's for after the issues are fixed, :)
[13:08:24] <robertmaxrees> also: just pass an object for the data, not a querystring.  you want to post data in the body.
[13:08:27] <geri> decx: its not completly fixed... i need to clear the outputctx before i draw the moving object by calling outputctx.clearRect ... so the outputctx.drawImage(radar_, 0, 0);   was gone :D
[13:08:45] <decx> fillRect is a bit faster
[13:08:51] <decx> unless you need transparency
[13:09:37] <geri> decx: now i got this effect: http://i.imgur.com/p582BKU.png
[13:09:44] <sharax> If the field lang put on my english
[13:09:48] <sharax>  And then the new your city to let
[13:09:51] <sharax> Only city will send post method.
[13:10:12] <taplar> not the way you have it
[13:10:23] <geri> decx: do you see the white areas?
[13:10:40] <taplar> $('select').on('change', ... is all select elements
[13:11:36] <decx> geri: seems like one of the canvases is missing some pixels
[13:11:44] <decx> gonna guess the main canvas
[13:11:50] <sharax> taplar: What should I do
[13:11:59] <taplar> fix your first doc ready first
[13:12:11] <decx> geri: oh right it looks like clearRect/fillRect doesnt fill the whole thing
[13:12:15] <taplar> then change your target of the second to be the select you want it to trigger on
[13:12:27] <decx> outputctx.fillRect(0,0,canvas.width, canvas.height)
[13:12:28] <taplar> and why two doc readys?
[13:14:59] <sharax> taplar -> i need filter results.
[13:15:01] <sharax> like https://www.verbling.com/tutoring
[13:15:34] <taplar> i'm not sure what that has to do with what we're talking about
[13:15:49] <robertmaxrees> sharax are you trying to get us to do it for you?
[13:15:53] <robertmaxrees> because that's not going to happen.
[13:17:09] <sharax> A code samples for study
[13:17:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah, we don't do that.
[13:17:23] <robertmaxrees> you need to write it yourself.
[13:17:31] <robertmaxrees> we can help you do that.
[13:17:42] <taplar> you got code issues.  we're telling you about them.  if you have questions about them, ask
[13:17:48] <sharax> On my site I can not send just one field To filter
[13:18:23] <taplar> but so far i haven't seen any effort to fix the issues we've pointed out
[13:20:10] <voal> hi, my sentence doesn't match an idea ? https://jsfiddle.net/zerunxv/8asprmdp/24/
[13:21:57] <taplar> no, your sentence doesn't explain your issue
[13:22:37] <geri> decx: i did use outputctx.fillRect(0,0,canvas.width, canvas.height)
[13:23:01] <decx> hm, and radar still gets the same dimensions?
[13:23:11] <geri> decx: yes
[13:23:17] <decx> weird
[13:23:45] <sharax> Do not understand it
[13:23:46] <sharax> How do I fix this problem.
[13:23:48] <sharax> :(
[13:24:02] <robertmaxrees> sharax what problem?
[13:25:13] <sharax> My code only sends one field by post.
[13:28:28] <sharax> How can the selection lang the same city I choose?
[13:28:29] <sharax>  And both of them for me to be post
[13:28:40] <sigdk> hello. I'm using .populate(obj) to map a json object onto a form. Is that a standarized jquery method or I'm using a plugin... ?
[13:28:56] <taplar> plugin i would assume
[13:28:59] <robertmaxrees> sigdk https://api.jquery.com/ - is populate listed there?
[13:29:18] <sharax> A function. One example code. An address the same problem. Please introduce a guide
[13:29:36] <sharax> I do not want to write code.
[13:29:43] <taplar> then your in the wrong room
[13:29:44] <robertmaxrees> sharax then you're in the wrong place :)
[13:29:52] <taplar> lol
[13:29:58] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, hmmm... nope. Is there any way to find out to which plugin I've included this belongs to ?
[13:30:01] <hellyeah> sharax:  glhf
[13:30:09] <robertmaxrees> sigdk search google?
[13:31:10] <hellyeah> jquey has something for d3.js?
[13:31:13] <taplar> could also look through the loaded files in your developer tools, if there are not alot
[13:31:16] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah what do you mean?
[13:31:30] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  do you know d3.js?
[13:31:47] <taplar> diablo 3
[13:31:58] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah i know of it - that question still doesn't make sense.  jquery is a dom abstraction library - it's not going to bake in anything for d4.
[13:32:31] <hellyeah> is there a d4?
[13:32:37] <hellyeah> damn
[13:32:42] <robertmaxrees> err, d3.
[13:32:44] <robertmaxrees> typo.
[13:33:15] <hellyeah> ic
[13:37:27] <netcrime> Hey, i have jquery code. It should do: When you check all checkboxes and uncheck parent it should remove only children data-id's from var Cityid. now somehow it removes all id's no matter if it's children or other parent chlidren. PASTEBIN https://jsfiddle.net/teLkpfhu/
[13:37:50] <taplar> the criminal returns
[13:38:00] <netcrime> Day 2
[13:38:09] <netcrime> Harassing internet jquery community
[13:39:01] <netcrime> criminal is going to commit crime on himself because it stuck with that god damn jquery for second day
[13:39:56] <taplar> what's the purpose of regionid?
[13:40:24] <netcrime> If only region id is checked i will return products from whole region
[13:40:43] <netcrime> I mean region checkbox..
[13:40:44] <taplar> i mean, is it supossed to be global for all check boxes?
[13:41:27] <netcrime> no i dont think so. Actualy everything works as i want with regionid you check it it is added to list you uncheck it it is deleted from list
[13:41:51] <netcrime> problem is that if i uncheck region (parent) checkbox i want to delete only children id's from CityId
[13:41:54] <taplar> it is global right now though, so that may be part of the issue
[13:42:02] <taplar> still looking
[13:42:16] <netcrime> Ok old lady
[13:42:23] <taplar> :)
[13:43:20] <taplar> you have duplicate ids
[13:43:22] <taplar> btw
[13:43:42] <taplar> parent-box
[13:44:43] <netcrime> well yeah its on purpose
[13:44:47] <taplar> it's invalid
[13:44:51] <netcrime> to find out if its parent box or n o
[13:44:52] <robertmaxrees> you can't repeat IDs.
[13:45:04] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure we explained that yesterday :)
[13:45:10] <taplar> and you should really split up that logic anyway, so your not cramming so much into the single handler
[13:46:24] <netcrime> robertmaxrees i actualy going to have 20 Parent boxes and ~300 cities pulled out from database so what all of them has to have unique ID's?
[13:46:32] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:46:34] <taplar> so make it a class
[13:46:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to see if something is a parent?  use a class for that instead.
[13:46:46] <robertmaxrees> we explained that yesterday, too :)
[13:47:01] * taplar defers the question to robert , heh
[13:47:51] <hellyeah> i really dont have any tolerate to read code
[13:47:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:48:03] <hellyeah> :XD
[13:48:27] <taplar> not a good trait for a programmer
[13:48:48] <hellyeah> one more thing to get over
[13:49:02] <netcrime> ok ill make that a class but is that the issue with my problem?
[13:49:29] <taplar> lol, so i have to ask.  how did you get into programming if you don't like reading code?
[13:49:36] <hellyeah> me
[13:49:46] <hellyeah> no it was just a joke
[13:49:47] <taplar> yes
[13:49:54] <taplar> k
[13:50:00] <hellyeah> i mean i woke up 6 a..m
[13:50:03] <hellyeah> everyday
[13:50:11] <hellyeah> my commute is like 140km
[13:50:22] <hellyeah> that means 4 hours on the road
[13:50:30] <hellyeah> and 8 hours in front of computer
[13:50:40] <hellyeah> this is really slavery
[13:50:55] <taplar> again, how did you get into programming then?
[13:51:10] <taplar> if you hate what you do, :/
[13:51:11] <robertmaxrees> sounds like people that work in the bay area.
[13:51:21] <hellyeah> taplar:  you get me wrong :D
[13:51:27] <hellyeah> i am just tired
[13:52:07] <hellyeah> if i hate that i cannot work on something like 2 months
[13:52:53] <hellyeah> anyway sorry for interrupting
[13:54:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm way lost.
[13:55:02] <hellyeah> why $.each and .each both exist
[13:55:11] <taplar> hmm?
[13:55:18] <robertmaxrees> two different jobs.
[13:55:24] <robertmaxrees> $.each() is a generic enumerator.
[13:55:30] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.each() is strictly for jquery objects.
[13:55:37] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain as much :)
[13:55:41] <hellyeah> $.each you can iterate jquery object and array right
[13:55:50] <hellyeah> .each is just for array
[13:55:51] <taplar> one could even say....... two each their own
[13:55:53] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't use it for jquery objects.
[13:55:55] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[13:56:02] <robertmaxrees> .each() is for jquery objects.
[13:56:07] <robertmaxrees> $('someSelector').each();
[13:56:19] <robertmaxrees> vs $.each(someArrayOrObject, function() {});l
[13:56:22] <taplar> awww, cough isn't in here
[13:56:28] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:56:53] <hellyeah> i am sorry forEach for array
[13:56:58] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:57:16] <hellyeah> $.each can be used for jquery object and array
[13:57:20] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:57:29] <robertmaxrees> $.each() is only for arrays/objects.  not for jquery objects.
[13:57:47] <decx> let's agree that this shit can be confusing
[13:57:53] <hellyeah> JQuery.each() -> A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays.
[13:58:14] <hellyeah> object but not jquery objects
[13:58:18] <robertmaxrees> yes.  "The $.each() function is not the same as $(selector).each(), which is used to iterate, exclusively, over a jQuery object. "
[13:58:29] <robertmaxrees> use $.fn.each for jquery objects.
[13:58:39] <hellyeah> $.fn.each
[13:58:41] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:58:46] <robertmaxrees> $('someSelector').each()
[13:58:46] <hellyeah> i didnt hear that
[13:58:51] <hellyeah> let me check
[13:58:52] <decx> $('div').each() = $.fn.each, $.each([array],fn) == $.each
[13:58:58] <taplar> otherwise your each for the jquery object would pass in like '0', '1', etc for the key
[13:59:15] <decx> you know if you write each often enough
[13:59:22] <decx> semantic satiation or something
[13:59:32] <hellyeah> what is fn for ? stands like an abbreveation fn = function
[13:59:34] <hellyeah> ?
[13:59:45] <taplar> the $.fn namespace is for jquery result sets
[13:59:51] <robertmaxrees> $.fn is where all the jquery methods are stored.
[13:59:54] <decx> fn is just prototype
[14:00:10] <hellyeah> ic
[14:00:15] <robertmaxrees> so $.fn.nameHere can be run against $()
[14:00:18] <hellyeah> so $.fn.map
[14:00:22] <robertmaxrees> is $().map
[14:00:23] <hellyeah> $.fn.ajax
[14:00:26] <robertmaxrees> right
[14:00:36] <hellyeah> $.fn.reduce
[14:00:40] <decx> no such thing
[14:00:43] * taplar flashes back to marry poppins
[14:00:45] <hellyeah> i chmm
[14:00:57] <decx> because it doesnt make sense to reduce html nodes
[14:01:03] <hellyeah> all jquery methods are stored in fn
[14:01:18] * taplar is stupid.  that was my fair lady
[14:01:20] <decx> fn is prototype and works like prototype anywhere else in js
[14:01:20] <robertmaxrees> not all, but most.
[14:01:24] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:01:29] <hellyeah> ic
[14:01:32] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax() isn't, for instance.
[14:01:37] <robertmaxrees> becauce it's a utility function.
[14:01:45] <robertmaxrees> stuff that you don't run against a jquery collection isn't in .fn
[14:01:47] <hellyeah> it is kind of confusing
[14:01:58] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  ic
[14:01:58] <robertmaxrees> nah, it's not.  pretty clear distinction.
[14:02:10] <hellyeah> i understand distinction now
[14:02:12] <hellyeah> it is clear
[14:02:25] <robertmaxrees> if you do $('someSelector').someNameHere, it's in $.fn.  if you do $.someNameHere, it's not.
[14:03:01] <hellyeah> what is the benefit of using $.fn
[14:03:06] <robertmaxrees> there isn't.
[14:03:09] <robertmaxrees> you don't directly use it.
[14:03:20] <robertmaxrees> that's just how you distinguish between methods and utility functions.
[14:03:22] <decx> so they dont have to write prototype everywhere
[14:03:32] <sigdk> so... I think .populate() is not what I need. How do I map a json object onto a form ?
[14:03:40] <taplar> find a plugin
[14:03:43] <robertmaxrees> sigdk manually.
[14:03:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:04:09] <decx> you can map json data into elements
[14:04:10] <arc_> okay, so i have an each, inside which i have an xmlhttprequest. because i'm doing 200+ requests, the each finishes before the requests finish. however, i want to run some code after all of the requests finish. what do i need to look into to figure out how to do this?
[14:04:11] <taplar> if the key's are directly related to the form elements, you could pretty easily iterate over it
[14:04:15] <hellyeah> so there is $.fn.map right?
[14:04:25] <taplar> hellyeah: yes
[14:04:28] <hellyeah> okey
[14:04:41] <robertmaxrees> arc_ you .map() into an array of deferreds instead and use .when
[14:04:51] <hellyeah> .map , Jquerymap and $.fn.map
[14:05:01] <hellyeah> it is great ii have three options
[14:05:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:05:10] <hellyeah> jQuery.map
[14:05:12] <arc_> hmm.. all right, i'll look into it. thanks
[14:05:14] <hellyeah> $.map
[14:05:21] <taplar> if you have Arrays.prototype.map you don't need the other for basic arrays
[14:05:24] <robertmaxrees> that's just a replacement for Array.prototype.map
[14:05:34] <hellyeah> i am sure they are different i just need to figure out
[14:05:34] <robertmaxrees> for browsers that don't support it.
[14:05:42] <decx> well $.map eats everything that can be iterated without having to bind or call which is nice
[14:05:59] <taplar> hellyeah: other than just for knowing, why?
[14:05:59] <robertmaxrees> $.map() and Array.prototype.map() are very similar. $.fn.map() is for jquery objects.
[14:06:34] <hellyeah> taplar:  i want to write a better code
[14:06:44] <hellyeah> clean and better code
[14:06:52] <sigdk> is there any example ? There are 10 elements. 2 of them required special handling though I guess. They are dropdown menus
[14:06:57] <taplar> so you understand when to use $().map and $.map, yes?
[14:07:04] <hellyeah> yes
[14:07:08] <taplar> so cool
[14:07:13] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:07:21] <taplar> the same reason for map() exists for all the others
[14:07:23] <robertmaxrees> sigdk where are you getting stuck?
[14:07:29] <hellyeah> $('selector').map right
[14:07:34] <hellyeah> $.map
[14:08:09] <decx> hellyeah: to get to that next step you can try and write something without jquery, where you dont do much dom stuff but still have to transform arrays
[14:08:28] <robertmaxrees> that's a good idea.
[14:08:38] <robertmaxrees> learning how to manipulate data is a great skill.
[14:09:20] <hellyeah> for clearafication
[14:09:47] <decx> like, i have an array of booleans, check if there's true in it without the use of indexOf and without creating any variable
[14:09:53] <hellyeah> $.map is same with jQuery.map right
[14:10:03] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah correct.
[14:10:11] <robertmaxrees> $ is a shortcut for jQuery
[14:10:25] <hellyeah> decx:  do i need filter for it?
[14:10:33] <decx> close
[14:10:43] <hellyeah> $.map is for jquery object
[14:10:51] <decx> doesnt really matter, but these are the kind of tasks you have to give yourself
[14:10:51] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:10:53] <decx> ^^
[14:10:57] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.map is for jquery obkects
[14:11:03] <taplar> i feel like we're in a loop
[14:11:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah...
[14:11:19] <decx> pft, i'm in a fold
[14:11:28] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:11:47] <hellyeah> i need to find a way to rest my mind
[14:11:54] <hellyeah> when i go out from job
[14:11:55] <taplar> i hear sleep works
[14:12:18] <hellyeah> okey one more thing
[14:12:20] <robertmaxrees> burnout's a terrible thing.
[14:12:39] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i remember the conversation
[14:12:43] <hellyeah> thanks for that
[14:13:02] <taplar> and yet we keep having it, :)
[14:13:23] <hellyeah> just one more thing
[14:13:25] <hellyeah> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[14:13:33] <hellyeah> it meantioned both object and array
[14:13:48] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[14:14:02] <decx> probably even strings
[14:14:05] <hellyeah> jQuery.eah this is
[14:14:10] <robertmaxrees> strings ARE objects :)
[14:14:19] <hellyeah> .each is just for object
[14:14:23] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:14:27] <taplar> .... hellyeah at this point it's probably best if you just stick some code in jsfiddle and see what happens
[14:14:33] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you're conflating things.
[14:14:35] <taplar> experiment
[14:14:35] <decx> well everythings an object in js technically ^^
[14:14:39] <robertmaxrees> jquery objects and normal objects are different.
[14:14:39] <geri> decx: any idea where that could come from? http://i.imgur.com/ZMvlryS.png
[14:14:47] <hellyeah> everything is an object
[14:14:51] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:14:56] <robertmaxrees> right, but $() is a special kind of object.
[14:15:05] <hellyeah> decx:  js is prototyped lang. that means js is oop
[14:15:05] <robertmaxrees> $.each()'s documentation is referring to non-jquery objects.
[14:15:08] <hellyeah> ?
[14:15:19] <decx> geri: only canvas width comes to mind
[14:15:26] <taplar> not oop
[14:15:32] <taplar> can be, but not by default
[14:15:43] <robertmaxrees> ^ closer to a weird OF language.
[14:15:46] <hellyeah> i saw es6 code
[14:15:56] <hellyeah> it really look alike java
[14:16:01] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[14:16:16] <hellyeah> they have class, extend, get and set
[14:16:29] <robertmaxrees> sure, but it still doesn't actually support classes.
[14:16:31] <taplar> which you can choose not to use
[14:16:34] <robertmaxrees> that's all syntactic sugar.
[14:16:48] <hellyeah> understood
[14:17:11] <hellyeah> but you can construct special structure right like linked list
[14:17:25] <taplar> sure
[14:17:33] <hellyeah> or tree
[14:17:37] <taplar> sure
[14:17:39] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[14:17:44] <hellyeah> sort of?
[14:17:57] <robertmaxrees> you can structure your objects that way, but JS doesn't support "real" linked lists.
[14:18:24] <hellyeah> but it can be smt close to linkedlist right
[14:18:29] <robertmaxrees> sort of?
[14:18:42] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:18:48] <hellyeah> understood
[14:18:49] <taplar> i'm sure it gets weird with the lack of pointers
[14:19:00] <hellyeah> haha,
[14:19:18] <hellyeah> let say you have ten elements linkedlist
[14:19:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah, stop there.
[14:19:25] <hellyeah> can i cut the connection on middle
[14:19:29] <robertmaxrees> here's no real linked list in JS.
[14:19:37] <taplar> y not just an array and use splice?
[14:19:37] <hellyeah> okey i stop
[14:20:08] <hellyeah> array is nice it is jus t my cariousity
[14:20:24] <hellyeah> doubly circular linked list is nice
[14:20:43] <taplar> *shrug*
[14:20:55] <taplar> array[ ++index % array.lenght ]
[14:20:56] <taplar> done
[14:21:09] <hellyeah> %
[14:21:19] <taplar> modulus
[14:21:30] <hellyeah> right
[14:22:07] <hellyeah> oh i need to ask some question with an example can i do that
[14:22:16] <robertmaxrees> please.
[14:22:20] <robertmaxrees> we prefer those.
[14:22:32] <hellyeah> [1, 2] [3, 4] -> [1 ,3] [2, 4]
[14:22:40] <hellyeah> doing this is simple
[14:22:45] <taplar> what is that?
[14:22:47] <robertmaxrees> but not a thing in JS.
[14:22:55] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:23:09] <hellyeah> taplar:  it is like swap
[14:23:12] <taplar> of?
[14:23:34] <hellyeah> you just swap 2 and 4
[14:23:41] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah what's your question?
[14:23:44] <taplar> not sure what kind of construct that is supposed to represent
[14:24:22] <hellyeah> [1 , 2 , 3] [4 , 5 ,6] -> [1, 4] [2, 5] [3, 6]
[14:24:35] <taplar> *sigh* is it two arrays in an array?
[14:24:47] <robertmaxrees> he's shuffling elements around.
[14:24:50] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah what's your question?
[14:25:03] <hellyeah> two seperate array taplar
[14:25:10] <taplar> ok
[14:25:14] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees in spesific  pattern
[14:25:31] <hellyeah> it can have more element you see what it looks like
[14:25:41] <hellyeah> i wonder is there built in function to do that
[14:25:44] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:25:47] <taplar> so your grouping elements by position
[14:26:03] <hellyeah> taplar:  yes
[14:26:18] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  understood
[14:26:23] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
[14:26:40] <geri> decx:
[14:26:41] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating data types from other languages with JS's.
[14:27:12] <geri> decx: i found this issue: the radar.clear calls fillRect and passes the radius of the circle.... wrong?
[14:27:21] <hellyeah> jquery behave same with js about hoisting?
[14:27:27] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS js.
[14:27:36] <robertmaxrees> it's just a library, so it follows the same rules.
[14:27:42] <hellyeah> okey
[14:29:20] <geri> decx: i mean diameter
[14:29:46] <decx> what was the fiddle
[14:30:54] <geri> decx: https://jsfiddle.net/98xek7x0/1/
[14:31:53] <decx> well try clearRect(0,0,radar.width,radar.height)
[14:33:21] <geri> decx: that works
[14:33:58] <geri> decx: is it because we dont clear the whole canvas?
[14:33:59] <arc_> well, i was trying to create a userscript that would allow me to sort my steam wishlist by the release date, but after being basically almost done with it, i learned something that prevents it from working at all.
[14:34:20] <arc_> valve allows developers to put literally whatever they want into the date field
[14:34:28] <arc_> for example, http://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails/?appids=369070&filters=release_date
[14:34:47] <arc_> what a waste of time
[14:37:35] <decx> geri: depends on what you did to draw it bigger
[14:46:13] <cangelosx> is there a way to disabled a form control so that the user cannot modify it, but still have it submit its value with the form?
[14:46:20] <cangelosx> to disable*
[14:49:15] <kevireilly>  cangelosx: the "disabled" property IE: <button disabled="disabled">Unclickable</button>
[14:49:19] <decx> text and a hidden field instead of the input
[14:50:04] <kevireilly> ah, yeah that is a better solution if you don't want them to see it <input type="hidden" name="secret" value="sauce" />
[14:50:21] <decx> for example you could prevent keydowns and pastes in the input but that's just masking the issue
[14:50:46] <cangelosx> problem is when a form control is disabled it wont submit its data
[14:50:58] <decx> yeah that's why you use a hidden input
[14:51:50] <cangelosx> thats an idea
[14:53:17] <cryptopsy> how can i have something like jqueryui menu where instead of each sub-menu opening beside its parent, is opened on top of its parent?
[15:29:09] <Guest8872> quit
[15:30:23] <adriaferre> Hello, my name is Adri√† Ferr√© Grau. I'm studying Computer Science at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (Barcelona) and I would like to take part in Google Summer of Code. How can I start?
[15:37:58] <sigdk> adriaferre, I think you need to write a proposal with what would you like to develop
[15:47:47] <William|i7> anyone know jsonapi spec? trying to see if this is a valid way to do relations/includes http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/?id=aa25b815c36f40ff8734f0e33bbf37d5
[16:05:38] <jnor> inside a loop is it possoble to make an if statement that can only be entered once?
[16:08:29] <taplar> sure
[16:08:38] <taplar> you'd need a persistant variable of some kind though
[16:09:56] <jnor> taplar: like window.globalVar ?
[16:10:16] <taplar> no, just outside the loop, or if your dealing with an object something on the object
[16:10:24] <taplar> what are you trying?
[16:10:50] <jnor> aHHHH ofc! Im stupid
[16:10:55] <jnor> thanks "__"
[16:24:23] <noregret> which event should i use in order to catch a radio buttont that is checked in a group of radio buttons
[16:24:34] <taplar> change i believe
[16:27:32] <noregret> taplar: thanks, that went fine
[16:39:35] <claytonzaugg> Is anyone aware of an extension or setting that will highlight code I modified in google chrome dev tools?
[16:41:23] <robertmaxrees> iirc you can have it just save to the files directly.
[16:42:23] <claytonzaugg> What?  How?
[16:42:42] <claytonzaugg> Well the code I'm modifying is injected through Test and Target though, so it's not really easy to just save the whole file
[16:42:48] <robertmaxrees> oh that.
[16:43:13] <claytonzaugg> Yeah, it'd be nice to see what I modify so I can easily go back and update accordingly
[16:43:14] <robertmaxrees> i remember T&T
[16:44:22] <claytonzaugg> Yep
[16:52:43] <cwek> Hi, how can I get "the real mouse coordinates" of rotated div? I mean when div is not rotated i subtracted e.pageX - offset of div. Now when It's rotated I have no idea.
[16:54:08] <chrispg21> when looping with .each() is there a simple way to get the previous element as a jquery object? collection[i-1].text() doesnt work
[16:54:30] <taplar> an optional parameter into the callback is the index
[16:54:35] <robertmaxrees> chrispg21 you want collection.eq()
[16:55:36] <chrispg21> robertmaxrees: thanks!!!
[16:56:14] <chrispg21> been scratching my head too long with that
[16:57:04] <robertmaxrees> did you see the error in your console?
[16:57:45] <chrispg21> kept saying text is not a function
[17:01:57] <DeltaHeavy> I'm using select2 and I'm wondering how I can pass parameters into the AJAX request?
[17:02:06] <DeltaHeavy> The docs don't seem to outline this - https://select2.github.io/options.html#ajax
[17:03:26] <shoky> cwek: i don't think there's a way to get it without doing some math. jquery definitely doesn't have a way ;p  but depending on what you're actually trying to do, there might be better solutions
[17:16:26] <jphase> DeltaHeavy: the same way you do a normal ajax request with jQuery
[17:19:34] <DeltaHeavy> jphase I don't pass a function in jQuery though.
[17:19:37] <DeltaHeavy> I pass an object
[17:19:44] <DeltaHeavy> I see it now, docs were kinda confusing me.
[17:19:45] <DeltaHeavy> Thanks!
[17:31:57] <chrispg21> anyone know what eq() stands for? Looking for an fun way to remember it
[17:32:34] <taplar> equal?
[17:32:43] <taplar> *shrug*
[17:32:59] <chrispg21> works for me
[17:33:05] <chrispg21> +1
[17:33:49] <shoky> yea it's equals. comes from the css selectors where there's :lt :gt :eq  (less-than, greater-than, equals)
[17:34:29] <chrispg21> sweet
[17:34:51] <shoky> sorry those are jquery selectors, not from css
[17:34:56] <shoky> but same deal
[17:37:20] <chrispg21> didnt know :lt :gt existed so thanks for that
[17:37:47] <shoky> i'd use .slice() instead of those two
[17:38:08] <chrispg21> thats what ive been using till now. Why not these?
[17:40:01] <shoky> personal preference mostly, also might be a tiny bit more performant
[17:50:07] <scri66le> I'm popluating an accordion via jquery but the functionality doesn't work for hte new li item. I've been googling and can't seem to find out what's going on. here's my code ->http://pastebin.com/2FCALrZT
[17:54:42] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/910706
[17:54:49] <robertmaxrees> scri66le ^
[17:55:44] <scri66le> my selector would be .accordion?
[17:55:54] <bango2> robertmaxrees whats it called when you invoke the event and it trickles down, instead of calling the event handler on each individual one?
[17:56:09] <robertmaxrees> scri66le the important part is the refresh.
[17:56:13] <robertmaxrees> bango2 huh?
[17:56:19] <Excedrin> propagation
[17:56:22] <robertmaxrees> bango2 you mean the capture phase?
[17:56:25] <robertmaxrees> or event delegation?
[17:56:27] <scri66le> it's not a jquery accordion. it's foundation 6. Does that make a difference?
[17:56:30] <bango2> delegation maybe
[17:56:39] <robertmaxrees> because in delegatiuon, nothing "trickles down"
[17:56:42] <bango2> anyway, whatever it is, i was thinking that might answer scri66le
[17:56:42] <robertmaxrees> scri66le yes.
[17:56:47] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:56:54] <robertmaxrees> scri66le is already using a delegated listener.
[17:57:04] <bango2> ok. i didnt look at the link anyway lol
[17:57:32] <robertmaxrees> scri66le yeah, foundation will be different from jquery.
[17:57:41] <scri66le> well shit
[17:58:26] <scri66le> is there a way to reinstantiate the accordion?
[17:58:48] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea.
[18:03:18] <scri66le> how would you do it robertmaxrees ?
[18:03:26] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea.
[18:03:30] <robertmaxrees> i don't use foundation.
[18:03:34] <robertmaxrees> soooo...
[18:04:08] <robertmaxrees> heh you're asking in the wrong place fwiw :)
[18:38:14] <Unknown601> hello

[18:48:04] <sharax> hi friend
[18:48:11] <Unknown601> hi
[18:48:20] <robertmaxrees> hello
[19:16:26] <jquery994> Hello everyone
[19:16:43] <robertmaxrees> hello
[19:16:59] <jquery994> Guys, I need some help and I have no idea how to do it. Here's the issue: I have some divs and a image tag,b lah blah blah. Right after that I have a <a> tag
[19:17:06] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[19:17:08] <jquery994> The template is not customizable, but I can insert javascript code
[19:17:08] <robertmaxrees> show us your html.
[19:17:49] <jquery994> nah, thats the issue. the only thing I can do is insert JS code. I'm not really into jQuery so I thought to ask for some help. I need to insert each <a> tag in the div with class .super-image right before it
[19:17:55] <jquery994> Do you know how to do it?
[19:18:01] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:18:10] <robertmaxrees> showing uis your html would help us help you.
[19:18:21] <robertmaxrees> you want .each() and .append().
[19:18:32] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[19:19:32] <jquery994> @robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/CTXZvQWR
[19:19:57] <jquery994> yeah. but how do I get to select the first <a> element after the div?
[19:20:05] <jquery994> cause there are a lot of divs like the one I sent you
[19:20:11] <Unknown601> div>a
[19:20:49] <Unknown601> in jquery .next
[19:21:04] <Unknown601> i think :P
[19:24:49] <jquery994> couldn't get it to work :(
[19:25:33] <jquery994> the next method selects the element right after
[19:25:42] <jquery994> i want to select the next <a> element, not the next element
[19:28:03] <Unknown601> ah
[19:28:20] <jquery994> got a way
[19:28:24] <jquery994> just used an absolute position
[19:28:45] <jquery994> is there anyway I can do this only when another element is on hover?
[19:35:45] <jquery994> How do I use each and next together?
[19:37:53] <Unknown601> jquery994, hmmm i don't know, have you tried asking on stackoverflow?
[19:38:35] <snover> that is a weird way to respond to a question in an irc support channel
[19:45:36] <b4b> lol
[19:59:09] <sharax> friends
[19:59:22] <sharax>            $('#sch-left').append(x+sch); not worked
[19:59:39] <sharax> and
[19:59:57] <sharax> var sch = 'ok123';
[20:00:08] <sharax> var x += 'yes';
[20:00:20] <sharax> sorry
[20:00:26] <sharax> var sch += 'yes';
[20:00:30] <sharax> is not worked
[20:00:33] <sharax> why!?
[20:24:17] <robertmaxrees> aaaand back.

[23:41:20] <louki> hello
[23:41:57] <louki> can someone help me for starting with jquery organisation for gsoc 2016
[23:42:30] <louki> i just want to know how to start
[23:42:45] <louki> how to contribute to jquery
[23:51:33] <zeroquake> Hello,why is jquery unbind so slow ? when removing like a single global event , it takes around 150ms
[23:53:32] <printForever> shoky are you here?
[23:53:50] <printForever> arc_?
[23:55:00] <printForever> Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 and 11, after you update the placeholder TEXT inside input field, IE focuses that INPUT field even though I've never clicked on it. How can I blur() the input field? I tried using blur() but it does nothing.
