[00:06:35] <Vivekananda> anyone around .
[00:06:49] <Vivekananda> wonder if I could ask a git question and someone could respond
[00:24:44] <ns5> When I run this js (https://github.com/metajack/profxmpp/blob/master/ch06/gab.js), in chrome console I see "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function   gab.js:308".  Any idea?
[00:27:55] <Cork> ns5: no
[00:28:21] <Cork> ns5: asking someone to parse the result of a 400 line long js file isn't really doable
[00:28:43] <Cork> ns5: oh wait you gave the line number
[00:28:58] <Cork> ns5: the code is written for jquery < 1.9
[00:29:08] <Cork> and your most likely using a newer version
[00:29:16] <ns5> Cork: exactly
[00:30:32] <ns5> Cork: what changed after jquery 1.9 that makes the code not valid?
[00:30:43] <Cork> ?live
[00:30:43] <b-ot> Cork: deprecated
[00:31:01] <Cork> sigh stupid bot
[00:31:10] <Cork> ?g site:api.jquery.com live
[00:31:11] <b-ot> Cork: .live() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/live/
[00:32:55] <ns5> Cork: can I simply replace live() with on()?
[00:33:02] <Cork> no
[00:33:07] <Cork> you need to rewrite it
[00:33:47] <Cork> $('selector').live('event', func) => $('static parent').on('event', 'selector', func)
[00:36:25] <ns5> Cork: thanks
[01:36:35] <Jahm> Why do my $.ajax( { type : 'GET', .... } ) always returns success but my $.ajax( { type : 'POST', .... } ) always returns error eventhough the credentials match
[01:45:37] <FilipNortic> success function of an ajaxrequest should be syncronus right?
[01:47:31] <Cork> FilipNortic: no
[01:47:51] <Cork> Jahm: the server might not support the post verb
[01:48:19] <FilipNortic> Cork: so they are not?
[01:48:29] <Cork> FilipNortic: ajax is async
[01:50:45] <FilipNortic> Cork: Ahh bad formulation maybe I mena the code block within the "success:" part
[01:50:56] <brunoais> FilipNortic, it is, yes
[01:51:04] <Cork> FilipNortic: ah, yes if you run a function it is sync
[01:51:05] <brunoais> the event is synchronous
[01:51:13] <Cork> FilipNortic: unless you call a function that makes the code async
[01:51:18] <FilipNortic> I have 2 functions i there that seems to be running at the same time
[01:51:21] <Cork> brunoais: uh... no
[01:51:28] <brunoais> Cork, really?
[01:51:33] * brunoais goes back to the spec
[01:51:39] <Cork> FilipNortic: code can't run at the same time
[01:51:46] <Cork> FilipNortic: that isn't possible
[01:51:56] <brunoais> (except with workers :))
[01:52:41] <FilipNortic> isn't that what a async request does or what I'm I missing
[01:53:09] <Cork> FilipNortic: javascript is single process
[01:53:18] <Cork> you can't ever run two functions at the same time
[01:53:46] <Cork> async means that functions can be called out of order
[01:53:55] <Cork> but execution is still single threaded
[01:54:36] <Cork> FilipNortic: so the stack currently executing has to return to the browser before the browser can execute anything else
[02:04:21] <e3d3> How to target links starting with http:// but not with http://blabla
[02:04:29] <e3d3> a[href^="http://"][href!="http://blabla"] didn't work, nor my tries with the not-selector.
[02:05:20] <Cork> a[href^="http://"]:not([href^="http://blabla"])
[02:09:18] <e3d3> Cork, Thanks, that : did it.
[02:10:41] <Cork> e3d3: though it you bind tha as a generic listener, you might want to move the exceptions into the function
[02:10:49] <Cork> so you don't have to run it on every link click
[02:13:03] <e3d3> I have, it was just that I forgot the : before the not-selector (and also another character). Thanks for helping.
[02:15:12] <e3d3> Cork, I see I forgot to encapsulate the :not in ( ) So I forgot tree characters.
[02:16:06] <Cork> e3d3: no i meant if you bind this as a delegated handler
[02:16:20] <Cork> you want not use :not() in the selector
[02:17:26] <e3d3> ? Isn't that the last part of your given solution
[02:17:47] <Cork> e3d3: sure, but i also commented on it not being a grate idea
[02:18:02] <ns5> Cork: so can I change $('.roster-contact').live('click', function()  to $(document).on('click', '.roster-contact', function()  ?
[02:18:32] <Cork> e3d3: if you run it in the selector it means the browser has to calculate it on every click on an a tag
[02:18:45] <Cork> e3d3: so it is normally better to move that logic out of there
[02:18:50] <e3d3> Didn't thought about that
[02:18:59] <Cork> ns5: yes
[02:19:07] <Cork> ns5: though you normally don't want to bind in on document
[02:20:31] <ns5> Cork: what is the proper way to do it with .on()?
[02:20:55] <Cork> ns5: the closest static common parent of the elements
[02:21:09] <Cork> ns5: in a few cases that might actually be document
[02:21:12] <Cork> but normally it isn't
[02:22:36] <seutje> can you even swap the body out?
[02:22:44] <ns5> Cork: can I just replace .live() with .bind()?
[02:22:57] <e3d3> Cork, I use it in the $(document).ready-function to append html-elements after links, to indicate the kind of links (intern/extern). Guess that it won't give extra browser-work. Am I right.
[02:23:02] <Cork> ns5: no
[02:23:09] <Cork> seutje: yes
[02:23:58] <seutje> oh yeah... document.body.parentNode.removeChild(document.body)
[02:24:01] <Cork> seutje: .fail(function(xhr) { document.open(); document.write(xhr.responseText); document.close(); });
[02:24:01] <seutje> poof, all gone
[02:24:06] <Cork> :)
[02:24:27] <seutje> all I got left is a head :D
[02:24:49] <seutje> $('head').wrapAll('<jar>'); giggedy giggedy
[02:24:50] <Cork> seutje: the code i just gave you removes everything below document
[02:25:09] <seutje> I like my head though
[02:25:28] <Cork> XD
[02:25:38] <Cork> but your ok with losing your body you mean?
[02:26:01] <seutje> head does the thinking, body is just mass to drag around and make typing more convenient ;P
[02:30:29] <Macaveli> I have a "$("#ajaxform").submit (e)->" is it possible to detect what button is pressed to submit the form? This is the console.log of e https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/d929d5147e1eed6f3915
[02:34:34] <sacho> Macaveli, check out srcElement
[02:34:58] <Cork> Macaveli: no you can't cross browser
[02:35:20] <Cork> Macaveli: only cross browser option is to bind individual click handlers on each button and set a value from there
[02:36:20] <seutje> there's a million ways to submit a form without clicking a button
[02:36:26] <seutje> ok, not literally a million, but a lot
[02:36:36] <Cork> ya
[02:36:58] <Cork> when you use multiple buttons to submit a form you should prob use options instead
[02:37:58] <sacho> options?
[02:38:37] <Cork> <input type="option">
[02:39:59] <Macaveli> Cork, I have 2 buttons that submit the form
[02:40:12] <Macaveli> I need to pass a different param with ajax deepening on which button
[02:40:13] <Cork> Macaveli: i know you said that before
[02:40:25] <Cork> Macaveli: and that was what i just commented on
[02:40:29] <Macaveli> alright
[02:40:44] <Macaveli> I will do that
[02:43:42] <brunoais> Cork, I checked on it. The "load" event is synchronous
[02:43:50] <linux_daemon> guys, i have a problem, why is this not working: http://jsbin.com/giloduve/1/edit ?
[02:43:57] <Cork> brunoais: no it isn't
[02:43:57] <linux_daemon> the resize ?
[02:44:14] <brunoais> If I understood right, sync and async events just means if there can be something in the middle of each call of the next listener
[02:44:36] <Cork> brunoais: no async means if it is called in code flow
[02:44:42] <Cork> and no event is
[02:45:27] <brunoais> Cork, http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#sync-async
[02:46:26] <linux_daemon> anyone?
[02:46:38] <Cork> brunoais: "The load event is queued to be fired asynchronously at the script element"
[02:46:49] <brunoais> that's for <script> elements
[02:47:15] <brunoais> you told that there's no such thing as synchronous events
[02:47:21] <Macaveli> Cork, not possible to pass values to the form using the button?
[02:47:25] <brunoais> that's that article, then?
[02:47:33] <brunoais> you may answer him first
[02:47:48] <Cork> brunoais: ok, try to make a code example where <script> /* code 1 */ /* bind load (code 2) */ /* code 3 */ executes 1,2,3
[02:47:53] <Cork> brunoais: you won't find it
[02:48:11] <Cork> Macaveli: you can set it on the form or globally, but not the form event no
[02:48:26] <brunoais> did you read the article? There's synchronous and ascynchronous events
[02:48:41] <brunoais> mousedown is synchronous, for example
[02:48:47] <Cork> brunoais: yes, but that is not related to sync and async *code flow*
[02:48:53] <brunoais> ofc
[02:49:17] <Cork> so your mixing things up
[02:49:25] <brunoais> I never talked about synchrony and ascynchrony code flow  :)
[02:49:33] <Cork> but everyone else did...
[02:49:40] <brunoais> oh
[02:49:49] <brunoais> I thought it was about synchronous and asynchronous events
[02:49:59] <brunoais> my bad, then
[02:50:12] <Cork> brunoais: no one normally cares about the async/sync bahaviours of the events
[02:50:27] <brunoais> why?
[02:50:28] <brunoais> I do
[02:50:30] <Cork> as that is normally implementation details in the browsers
[02:50:31] <seutje> never occurred to me
[02:50:41] <jimi_> can someone recommend a solution for auto including js files based on need. I think we are in a place where we are just including shit randomly because its been used in the past.
[02:50:42] <Cork> and doesn't affect how the js code works
[02:50:53] <seutje> I just catch em, I don't care about the internals
[02:51:02] <brunoais> I do
[02:51:06] <brunoais> helps me using them better
[02:51:08] <Cork> linux_daemon: your code doesn't run
[02:51:17] <seutje> jimi_: require.js?
[02:51:34] <Cork> brunoais: if you need to care about inter event communication you most likely are doing something wrong
[02:51:48] <seutje> there's more opinionated libraries out there though, if that's ur thing
[02:52:34] <brunoais> Cork, not that I need to care. I do care in order to understand the inner works of the browser. That helps me understanding how I should be doing stuff
[02:52:57] <brunoais> the same way i read how C's printf works which helped me using it better
[02:53:42] <linux_daemon> can anyone help me with my problem?
[02:54:29] <brunoais> linux_daemon, read Cork's answer.
[02:55:08] <linux_daemon> i dont see the answer
[02:55:56] <linux_daemon> oh
[02:56:06] <linux_daemon> wait
[02:58:34] <linux_daemon> here it is: http://jsbin.com/giloduve/1/edit
[02:58:43] <jimi_> seutje, ok ty. Will that also help with minifying, etc? I just ran Yslow, and we have 31 external requests.
[02:59:29] <linux_daemon> now it runs, but, when i run the same code on my machine, it show the empty...the height of the $("res") is 0
[03:00:53] <Cork> linux_daemon: your code doesn't wait for ready
[03:00:57] <Cork> might be why
[03:01:05] <Cork> ah wait
[03:01:20] <Cork> the js isn't related...
[03:03:32] <linux_daemon> on jsbin works, but not on my machine
[03:03:50] <Cork> so the error is somewhere else
[03:04:35] <linux_daemon> i get a div height of 0px
[03:07:12] <linux_daemon> i dont understand why
[03:08:55] <Cork> linux_daemon: is the div or one of its parents hidden when you calculate?
[03:11:47] <linux_daemon> nothing is hidden
[03:15:42] <FilipNortic> when I create rows in a table with a loop $('mytable tr:last') .after(myrow ) is 3 times $('mytavle').append('myrow') is this usally hte case?
[03:15:52] <FilipNortic> 3 times slower
[03:16:12] <infoget> Hi quys, I need data from selected option, Is this correct? $("#select").filter(':selected').text(); ?
[03:16:21] <brunoais> FilipNortic, I advise you to cache the jQuery selection
[03:16:42] <seutje> jimi_: there's an optimisation script for require.js that will stuff it all in 1 file for you and even render templates and stuff
[03:16:51] <seutje> http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html
[03:17:33] <brunoais> infoget, no.
[03:17:39] <brunoais> That returns a single element
[03:17:55] <brunoais> you will get 1 or 0 elements there, depending what you are gathering
[03:18:18] <brunoais> let me get some info form jQuery just to be sure I don't let you go into error
[03:18:45] <seutje> infoget: slap a .children() after the $('#select') to match the actual <option> elements
[03:18:48] <brunoais> infoget, try this example: http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[03:19:04] <seutje> actually, might wanna use .find('option:selected') to avoid optgroup issues
[03:19:10] <brunoais> infoget, seutje idea might actually be better
[03:19:39] <brunoais> I usualy use a simple line for it
[03:20:08] <brunoais> selectBox.options[selectBox.selectedIndex].value
[03:20:34] <brunoais> just choose the one you are most confortable with
[03:20:48] <infoget> .find('option:selected').text(), so this can be correct, right?
[03:21:47] <brunoais> infoget, yes
[03:21:52] <brunoais> it is correct
[03:22:10] <infoget> Ok, thank you guys, seutje, brunoais
[03:22:15] <brunoais> *That is correct (not just a can be)
[03:32:13] <linux_daemon> windows resize problems with svg drawings...
[03:35:19] <linux_daemon> any help with that?
[04:01:15] <linux_daemon> can anyone help me with a svg please?
[04:01:23] <Macaveli> Cork, I have "$("#ajaxform").submit (e,value)->" how can I submit that?
[04:01:44] <Cork> Macaveli: $("#ajaxform").submit() ?
[04:01:59] <Cork> linux_daemon: you've gotten any further?
[04:02:45] <linux_daemon> no, tried the window resize on the div i am using to put the svg element into, but the resize doesnt work
[04:02:58] <Macaveli> Cork, yes cork but I have to pass the value and what to fill in for the e?
[04:03:12] <Macaveli>  $("#ajaxform").submit("","myvalue')
[04:03:30] <linux_daemon> http://jsbin.com/giloduve/1/edit there i can see some resizing, but on my machine doesnt work
[04:03:31] <Cork> Macaveli: no .submit() is a short hand for .trigger('submit')
[04:03:53] <Cork> linux_daemon: on your maching with that page?
[04:04:00] <Cork> or your local instance of the same code?
[04:04:05] <Macaveli> Cork, can't I pass values?
[04:04:10] <Cork> Macaveli: no
[04:04:57] <Cork> Macaveli: the value i talked about you should handle with a click is something like
[04:05:21] <Macaveli> Yeah I'm doing that
[04:05:29] <Macaveli> hold on I'll gist it
[04:05:43] <Cork> $('form').on('click', 'button', function() { $(this).closest('form').find('input[name="action"]').val($(this).data('action')); });
[04:05:49] <Cork> the rest just works by its self
[04:05:49] <linux_daemon> Cork - yes, exactly the same code but what i see is a div with 0px height
[04:06:08] <Cork> linux_daemon: so you have to identify what differs from your local copy then
[04:06:41] <Macaveli> Cork, https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/7ef9f1deefb93b7dd6ee
[04:07:06] <Macaveli> I need to pass the button that triggers the form submit to my data
[04:07:10] <Cork> Macaveli: no you don't trigger submit from the button
[04:07:19] <Cork> you set a input value from the click
[04:07:28] <Cork> submit works by its self
[04:07:54] <Cork> also attr("disabled", "disabled")  <-- this is wrong
[04:08:03] <Cork> never ever use attr for changing state on form elements
[04:08:14] <Cork> use prop('disabled', true/false)
[04:10:10] <FilipNortic> ok so the main problem seems to have been the selector but can't find an answer to if .append() is faster then .after() or if there equal in speed?
[04:10:42] <Cork> FilipNortic: there isn't much difference
[04:10:57] <Cork> the difference is about how they locate where the nodes should be appended
[04:11:36] <Cork> FilipNortic: but you should use append if you want to add it to the end of a parent
[04:11:53] <Cork> after is for if you want to insert it in-between elements
[04:22:06] <linux_daemon> aaaaahhhhhh this stupid svg
[04:25:44] <linux_daemon> http://jsbin.com/giloduve/1/edit this one works, but only when i start resizing the window...on the begining the page is blank, waiting for the resizing
[04:27:39] <linux_daemon> Cork?
[04:30:14] <Cork> linux_daemon: http://jsbin.com/giloduve/9/edit
[04:31:37] <seutje> beat me to it, xcept I used .trigger('resize')
[04:31:45] <seutje> u know how I feel about convenience methods :P
[04:34:02] <jimi_> For mobile, is it beter for an xhr to return json, and then build the html elements and attach to dom for some functionality, or just return html string and append?
[04:35:03] <linux_daemon> got it :D thank you :)
[04:41:31] <seutje> jimi_: depends, if ur doing it a lot, it makes sense to just send data over the wire and have the template only be transferred once
[04:41:46] <seutje> if ur only doing it once or twice, it's probably not really worth it
[04:50:59] <jimi_> seutje, a lot of this guys code is when you click, requesting some data, and thend isplying it.. and its a lot of it
[04:51:27] <seutje> guess that answers your question then :)
[04:55:26] <dwarder> why my function not found ? U    modules/catalog/catalog.php
[04:55:26] <dwarder> U    api/universal/1.0/index.php
[04:55:38] <dwarder> sorry
[04:56:10] <dwarder>  http://jsfiddle.net/bwFs5/
[04:56:24] <dwarder> why my function not found?
[04:56:41] <Cork> dwarder: cause you try to access it from the global scope
[04:57:38] <dwarder> Cork: how do i fix it?
[04:57:46] <Cork> dwarder: http://jsfiddle.net/bwFs5/1/
[04:58:08] <dwarder> Cork: what is changed?
[04:58:16] <Cork> dwarder: i moved the js out of the html
[04:58:52] <dwarder> Cork: hmm, but i need to run this like this
[04:59:07] <Cork> dwarder: then you have to define the function as a global function
[04:59:09] <dwarder> Cork: html part is not changble
[04:59:17] <Cork> event attributes don't have scope
[04:59:18] <dwarder> Cork: i.e. window.
[04:59:45] <Cork> dwarder: also you never HAVE to define event handlers the wrong way
[04:59:50] <Cork> you might choose to
[05:05:07] <jimi_> seutje, can you recommend a json  to template framework?
[05:05:15] <jimi_> probably like angular or something?
[05:05:49] <Cork> there is quite a few of those
[05:06:27] <Cork> mustache, angular, jqote2, underscore...
[05:09:56] <seutje> usually use underscores or a slightly tweaked version of John Resig's microtemplating framework
[05:10:04] <seutje> underscore's
[05:10:14] <Cork> i like jqote2 a lot
[05:10:20] <seutje> angular does a shotload more than just templating though
[06:07:25] <reuf> anyone know some place to fownload gif which animate sending of email and another one which animates sending of sms?
[06:07:42] <FransNL_> oi..
[06:08:05] <FransNL_> how do i create dynamic variable name like test + uploadid?
[06:08:06] <seutje> reuf: geocities?
[06:08:19] <FransNL_> so it’s test102
[06:08:22] <FransNL_> for example
[06:08:32] <seutje> just concat
[06:08:43] <decx> in an iife, what's the thing in the trailing ellipses called? (function(){ })(thisthing)
[06:08:48] <seutje> varName + otherVarName
[06:08:53] <seutje> decx: argument?
[06:08:56] <seutje> parameter?
[06:09:02] <decx> one of those
[06:09:10] <MikeD_> FransNL_: i's suggest making an object like:  var test = {};   test[ theid ] = whatever;
[06:09:14] <decx> so there's no real name :>
[06:09:15] <seutje> it's basically like var foo = function() {}; foo(thisthing);
[06:09:35] <seutje> it's  an argument to the function... some ppl would call it a parameter to the function
[06:09:36] <FransNL_> ok MikeD_
[06:09:37] <decx> i know what it does, ... somewhat. but i thought there was a special name _>
[06:09:59] <seutje> fuck semantics tbh, call it a unicorn if u want
[06:10:15] <seutje> as long as the people you work with know what a unicorn is :P
[06:11:11] <decx> i'll call it undefined
[06:11:31] <MikeD_> unicorn goes drinking at a foobar
[06:11:58] <MikeD_> to get fubar
[06:12:44] <decx> does it have to be a function?
[06:13:31] <decx> nevermind
[06:13:43] <decx> missed a comma
[06:13:45] <decx> semi
[06:15:07] <FransNL_> worked like a charm MikeD_
[06:15:34] <FransNL_> mutliple setInterval $.post requests that need to stop independantly
[06:16:51] <MikeD_> that dynamic named variables stuff is usually the wrong road, glad an alternate approach solved the need
[06:48:25] <disorder20> hi
[06:48:31] <disorder20> I have a problem with a site
[06:48:53] <disorder20> the site loads common.js which seems a clone/wrapper of jquery
[06:49:06] <disorder20> and now I need a picture carousel
[06:49:15] <disorder20> and all libraries seem to need jquery
[06:49:38] <disorder20> if I try to load jquery instead of that common.js a function is missing   (   jquery.cookie)
[06:49:41] <disorder20> what can I do?
[06:49:49] <xec> is the site live?
[06:49:52] <disorder20> yeah
[06:50:24] <xec> what's the url
[06:50:47] <disorder20> pasted in query
[06:51:17] <seutje> aw man, I don't get to have a looksie?
[06:51:43] <disorder20> http://odaborsa.com/search#.U4XozVR_uQ7
[06:51:44] <seutje> it's cause I'm white, isn't it?
[06:51:47] <disorder20> lol
[06:51:48] <xec> lol seutje
[06:51:50] <disorder20> I'm white too
[06:51:59] <seutje> should be ashamed of yourself!
[06:52:09] <xec> disrespecting your own kind like that
[06:52:34] <seutje> nah, white ppl should just be ashamed, period :P
[06:52:39] <disorder20> maybe I should load jquery for the carousel library only, and point the library to the correct jquery
[06:52:39] <seutje> disorder20: ur referencing http://odaborsa.com/js/ajquery-1.8.3.min.js
[06:52:44] <disorder20> I don't know if it's possible
[06:52:54] <seutje> should that be http://odaborsa.com/js/jquery-1.8.3.min.js, per chance?
[06:52:57] <disorder20> seutje: yeah right now the site loads common.js
[06:52:59] <seutje> (without the a)
[06:53:08] <xec> disorder20: looks like jquery 1.6.2 is already loaded, does your carousel plugin not support that version?
[06:53:14] <disorder20> no
[06:53:23] <disorder20> xec: jquery 1.6 already loaded?
[06:53:33] <disorder20> it doesn't seems to be loaded
[06:53:41] <xec> disorder20: yes, just open the console and do $().jquery
[06:53:50] <xec> i got "1.6.2" back
[06:53:58] <disorder20> yeah
[06:53:59] <seutje> there's a 1.6.2 in the global scope, just log jQuery.fn.jquery
[06:54:06] <disorder20> that common.js has jquery 1.6 embedded
[06:54:14] <disorder20> maybe
[06:54:20] <seutje> it throws it in the global scope?
[06:54:29] <seutje> seems to kinda defeat the purpose of common.js, no?
[06:54:40] <disorder20> so maybe cookie waas a function deprecated in jquery 1.8
[06:55:00] <slax0r> is there a JS/jQ equivalent to PHPs number_format?
[06:55:02] <disorder20> if I unload common.js, jquery isn't loaded
[06:55:04] <xec> no i think common.js is jquery plus the cookie plugin (and more)
[06:55:04] <slax0r> wait
[06:55:06] <slax0r> I think I have one
[06:55:12] <disorder20> ok xec
[06:55:15] <seutje> cookie isn't core jQuery tho
[06:55:18] <seutje> oh, I see
[06:55:20] <disorder20> so I'll try jquery 1.8 + cookie
[06:55:25] <d0de> which do you think would be faster for strings of around 500 - 3000 chars: counting the characters with text() or searching for a search term with indexOf() ? I'm tring to decide which to do first
[06:55:49] <xec> disorder20: the site probably relies on more stuff in common.js, why don't you just use the version that is included
[06:56:18] <disorder20> because all libraries for carousel seem to need jquery 1.8+
[06:56:26] <seutje> d0de: strings don't have a text() method, are you secretly using DOMNode references instead?
[06:56:44] <disorder20> if someone know some old library, you're welcome
[06:57:16] <MikeD_> d0de: "faster" by what amount before it matters?
[06:57:24] <seutje> cycle is 1.7 and up
[06:57:37] <d0de> seutje, I'm going to use $(string).text() just to count the characters
[06:57:46] <xec> disorder20: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1566595/can-i-use-multiple-versions-of-jquery-on-the-same-page
[06:57:48] <seutje> d0de: that doesn't work
[06:57:52] <seutje> just use string.length
[06:58:12] <seutje> $(string) will make jQuery try to either parse it as HTML or as a selector
[06:58:15] <decx> but string contains html
[06:58:22] <d0de> seutje, that's the desired behavior in this case
[06:58:35] <d0de> yeah, I should probably have said
[06:58:46] <seutje> so it has an outer wrapper?
[06:58:53] <disorder20> xec: thanks
[06:58:59] <d0de> yep, I'm just counting the stuff inside tags
[06:59:08] <seutje> like the string starts with '<div>' and ends with '</div>'?
[06:59:17] <d0de> yeah, or similar
[06:59:29] <d0de> <p> </p> or w/e
[06:59:33] <seutje> yeah, then I guess $(string).text().length should do
[07:03:15] <d0de> I'm using indexOf to search for a user query in a string, is there anything built in to jQuery that's a bit more flexible with uppercase / lowercase etc? I only need to detect if the query is present
[07:03:44] <disorder20> xec: so in my carousel library, I need every '$' with jquery-ver  ?
[07:03:46] <disorder20> is it correct?
[07:04:38] <xec> disorder20: most likely you can just wrap the entire plugin in something like (function($){ /*in here $ will be the jquery version passed*/ })(jquery-ver)
[07:04:51] <disorder20> ok
[07:05:14] <xec> disorder20: usually the plugin already does something like that already and you can just change it
[07:05:30] <xec> already
[07:05:59] <Th3FalleN> anyone know if it is possible to make a promise when using remove()? i need to wait until the element is removed before running the next line?
[07:06:13] <disorder20> xec: not in my case imho
[07:06:15] <disorder20> http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fotorama/4.5.1/fotorama.js
[07:06:57] <xec> disorder20: do you see the very end: "undefined"!=typeof jQuery&&jQuery
[07:07:09] <xec> swap both of those "jQuery" with your var
[07:07:27] <disorder20> oh
[07:07:29] <disorder20> ok
[07:08:12] <Th3FalleN> nevermind apparently i can wrap it in a $.when
[07:09:42] <xec> disorder20: there is one other reference to "jQuery.Fotorama" in there, you might want to swap that too, idk
[07:12:57] <Th3FalleN> anyone know when running this https://gist.github.com/th3fallen/3d162934627e5358221f the dom still removes the class before the element?
[07:14:13] <farn5w0rth> in one of the rows of my table i have varied lengths of text. how do i check if there are 2 or more lines of text? if there are, i want to show a button to collapse/expand the text…?
[07:15:50] <BillCriswell> farn5w0rth: Hmmm...
[07:16:36] <farn5w0rth> BillCriswell: looking at this now http://shakenandstirredweb.com/240/jquery-moreless-text
[07:17:56] <BillCriswell> farn5w0rth: This sets a height on the element, which isn't really detecting one line, instead forcing it to be one line (and it would only work at a certain font-size).
[07:18:02] <MikeD_> farn5w0rth: those are some eye-catching buttons  (like a rusty nail)
[07:19:18] <Th3FalleN> guessing im not the only one stumped with mine. back to google
[07:19:45] <farn5w0rth> MikeD_: big time. BillCriswell: yep agreed and it doesnt hide the button if there are 2/3 lines vs more than 3 lines
[07:22:30] <BillCriswell> farn5w0rth: The only solid way I could imagine doing it is wrapping each word in a span or something and checking all the offset tops on them, which feels nasty.
[07:22:43] <seutje> lol
[07:22:50] <farn5w0rth> lol
[07:23:12] <BillCriswell> It sucks you can't do p { opacity: 0; } p:first-line { opacity: 1; } haha
[07:23:12] <seutje> just check the element height against 2x(font-size + line-height) or something?
[07:23:31] <BillCriswell> seutje: It's in a table, so the height of all the tds would be the same.
[07:23:37] <BillCriswell> Unless they're wrapped in a div or something.
[07:23:40] <seutje> wrote  a line-clamp polyfill a while back, lemme see if I can find it
[07:24:06] <seutje> only per row, but yeah, u'd need to wrap em then
[07:24:54] <seutje> oh look https://github.com/josephschmitt/Clamp.js
[07:25:47] <BillCriswell> Hate when it's hard to find a demo.
[07:26:05] <seutje> http://joe.sh/clamp-js
[07:26:30] <BillCriswell> I saw that, still didn't see a demo?
[07:26:33] <seutje> it's in the description though
[07:26:35] <BillCriswell> I could be missing it. Super oblivious.
[07:26:52] <seutje> oh lol, they're images
[07:27:25] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[07:27:45] <BillCriswell> I think I found a way?
[07:27:56] <BillCriswell> It seems scrollHeight is still available on a overflow: hidden; element.
[07:27:59] <BillCriswell> At least in chrome.
[07:29:03] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/donomaxe/1/edit?html,js,output weee
[07:29:12] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/5yDAS/
[07:29:48] <seutje> even does resize handling
[07:29:57] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/donomaxe/2/edit?css
[07:30:24] <BillCriswell> Hmmm....
[07:30:32] <BillCriswell> *cracks knuckles*
[07:30:57] <BillCriswell> Ah nevermind. Was going to cheat and use an after absolutely positioned but the text isn't always to the right lol
[07:31:17] <JustMozzy> hey everyone. I am using .detach on a div and .append to move it to another element. works like a charme, only IE8 is not playing along. any ideas?
[07:31:39] <BillCriswell> JustMozzy: Would need to see some code in a fiddle or bin.
[07:32:07] <d0de> Say I'm storing a bunch of HTML objects before I inject them into the DOM. They each have a data- attribute with a number in it. I want to sort them by that number before injecting them. What should I use?
[07:32:36] <d0de> i.e. so that they are appended to the DOM ordered by the number in the data- attribute
[07:32:36] <BillCriswell> d0de: How are you generating the HTML?
[07:33:49] <d0de> BillCriswell, I don't really know how to answer that. I have a function that takes a few different inputs of strings of HTML, mucks about with them a bit, assembles them into an HTML object and then outputs them
[07:34:14] <d0de> so I end up with a bunch of these standardized HTML objects, waiting to be injected
[07:34:25] <MikeD_> d0de: why isn't the server ordering them before output?
[07:35:10] <d0de> MikeD_, there is no server, this is all client side. The inputs are taken from an asynchronous call to the google feeds API
[07:35:28] <JustMozzy> BillCriswell: here's ma fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Baue9/
[07:35:40] <BillCriswell> d0de: Is the sort number present in that response?
[07:35:58] <d0de> yes
[07:36:09] <JustMozzy> just that jsfiddle doesn't work on IE8 either
[07:37:02] <BillCriswell> d0de: I would sort the array that the feeds api gives you then.
[07:37:11] <d0de> but I'm not sure how to get from there to sorting them inside the storage object
[07:37:34] <d0de> oops, sorry, wrote that before I saw your response
[07:37:44] <MikeD_> is the storage object an array?
[07:38:10] <BillCriswell> JustMozzy: I thought you were using detach for something?
[07:38:11] <d0de> it can be, I haven't built it yet
[07:38:52] <JustMozzy> BillCriswell: ops. yes. forgot to put that in the fiddle. can you actually open the fiddle in IE8? Mine doesn't
[07:38:53] <MikeD_> you can pass a custom function to the array .sort() method...
[07:39:15] <JustMozzy> http://jsfiddle.net/Baue9/1/
[07:39:50] <d0de> BillCriswell, the problem is that, in order to sort the arrays given by the feeds API, I'd have to wait for the response for each feed, combine all the arrays together, then sort, so it would take quite a long time before I could inject anything at all. What I'm hoping for is a solution at the other end of the process so that if I have, say, ten entries ready to be injected, I can just sort them and then go
[07:40:45] <MikeD_> Or are you hoping to inject them as you receive each one?
[07:41:09] <BillCriswell> JustMozzy: Shouldn't b.detach() be assigned to something? Not sure what's actually happening with B in your demo.
[07:41:22] <saramgsilva> i need help in a issue using jquery & jquery mobile in WP8
[07:41:30] <saramgsilva> how can help me?
[07:41:32] <JustMozzy> BillCriswell: the detach is not important anyway. what is more important is the append part
[07:41:48] <d0de> MikeD_, no I'm hoping to batch them. I.E wait for x entries to be ready, sort them, then inject
[07:42:11] <MikeD_> are you sorting them per batch, or into those that have already arrived?
[07:42:11] <d0de> array.sort() might be ok, I've never used custom functions for it before. I'll look into it
[07:43:17] <d0de> eugh, the webchat isn't scrolling up when new messages get posted for some reason :(
[07:43:20] <BillCriswell> Man, anyone using IE8 should be  punched in the mouth.
[07:43:27] <BillCriswell> JustMozzy: I can't get it to load.
[07:43:58] <tw2113> i feel the same about hosts that still use php5.2 as default
[07:44:05] <tw2113> they should be punched in more than just the mouth though
[07:44:35] <ChgMuc> why when i put in the url some car which has spaces in the page show like %20 and like this and generates error
[07:44:59] <BillCriswell> JustMozzy: I'd just work from the ground up. Try $('.foo').append('.bar') in IE, if that works add it to the switch, and just keep working up from there.
[07:45:25] <BillCriswell> JustMozzy: Shot in the dark but maybe a semi-colon after the closing } for mop.
[07:45:47] <Tomashe> Hey guys , i got a problem. i got an object var array, when i use that function and console.log it , it just make it json with no values {},{},{} ... var contacts = JSON.stringify(array);
[07:45:49] <Tomashe> any ideas?
[07:46:04] <seutje> does jsfiddle even support IE8?
[07:46:22] <JustMozzy> BillCriswell: just found the problem. the function itself was not called within my project. so now I know that IE8 doesn't recognize $(window).resize() but $(window).trigger('resize')
[07:46:22] <seutje> open a fresh fiddle on IE8 and watch the cascade of errors
[07:46:23] <BillCriswell> seutje: Looking at it now I don't think so lol.
[07:46:29] <MikeD_> Tomashe: are those js-native objects?
[07:46:47] <BillCriswell> seutje: IT still says "Loading..." in the console for me.
[07:47:16] <tw2113> does jsfiddle in IE8 make a nice agile waterfall? :D
[07:48:09] <BillCriswell> tw2113: I don't even know what half those words mean.
[07:48:15] <BillCriswell> JustMozzy: Haha glad you got it.
[07:48:56] <ChgMuc> The browser add automatically %20%30 to my url and genrate error!
[07:50:18] <BillCriswell> tw2113: I've seen them in pictures, though.
[07:50:38] <tw2113> what does agile look like in pictures? :D
[07:51:13] <MikeD_> tw2113: ever seen a chicken with it's head cut off?
[07:51:34] <Tomashe> Yes MikeD_
[07:51:46] <tw2113> not recently
[07:51:48] <MikeD_> that's what agile looks like in pictures
[07:52:09] <MikeD_> at first i was going with the culturally-insensitive "chinese firedrill"
[07:54:20] <d0de> this is basically the problem I'm trying to solve: http://jsfiddle.net/s2fHa/1/
[07:54:36] <tw2113> i was tempted to reference bacon eaters, but decided not to
[07:58:35] <d0de> I suppose I could make it an array of objects, and have the HTML object keyed to a string with the number in it, and then just sort by the number?
[08:01:10] <seutje> d0de: pass a sorting handler, will ya?
[08:01:49] <MikeD_> yeah, what he (and I) said
[08:02:00] <Tomashe> So maybe someone else ?
[08:03:28] <stack> hello, is that possible to give an order to event handlers like form submit events?
[08:04:22] <NoiseEee> stack: why would a form have more than a single submit event?
[08:04:42] <NoiseEee> stack: give it a single handler, from THAT handler call other functions etc
[08:05:48] <seutje> d0de: http://jsfiddle.net/s2fHa/2/ took the liberty of also caching that array length
[08:06:20] <seutje> u could use .data instead btw http://jsfiddle.net/s2fHa/3/
[08:06:38] <seutje> but in this case, that would just be overhead, rly
[08:08:52] <seutje> d0de: if you don't pass a handler for sort, it will assume all values are strings and need to be sorted alphabetically
[08:09:14] <seutje> js> print([1, 7, 10].sort().join(', '));
[08:09:18] <b-ot> seutje: 1, 10, 7
[08:09:33] <d0de> seutje, thanks very much! extremely helpful!
[08:09:49] <seutje> it also has no clue what jQuery collections are, so you need to massage it in the handler
[08:10:05] <stack> NoiseEee: because of separated files/libraries
[08:10:05] <seutje> or callback or whatever the term is this week
[08:10:27] <stack> NoiseEee: I was handling that as a composition of concerns
[08:10:31] <d0de> I didn't really understand the whole a / b thing, but I think I get it now
[08:10:46] <stack> but yeah, I would do that if it is not possible
[08:12:58] <d3m0n> Hey guys, I know this is wrong but can someone point me in the right direction. I am trying to cache the news because it get requested on all page of my site since it's in a sidebar. http://pastebin.com/ghQ8qXVh PHP that the ajax calls is a print.
[08:15:37] <jphase> d3m0n: guess I'm not really sure what your definition of caching is.
[08:16:26] <d3m0n> jphase: Well I guess to not have to call PHP backend everytime a page is loaded. Since it's the same content.
[08:16:53] <decx> you can put it in localstorage after a succesful request and retrieve from there
[08:17:56] <jphase> you'll still have to do some sort of periodic check to the server for updates too, so you'll need to determine how you want to do that. probably another piece of data in localstorage that has the last time a request was made and check for the right interval
[08:18:54] <d3m0n> Ahh that's a good point
[08:21:09] <diverdude> Hi, is there a way to create a text-input box with syntax highlighting ?
[08:22:27] <jphase> diverdude: nope, you need a containing element that can have elements inside it that you style
[08:23:29] <diverdude> jphase: right...so div with spans. is there a library that implements this already? (no wysiwyg editor9
[08:23:59] <jphase> yeah, there's several
[08:25:23] <diverdude> wonderful. http://codemirror.net/ is so nice
[08:25:33] <decx> i like rainbow.js
[08:34:24] <jParkton> I need some help understanding the hand.arc(); function parameters
[08:34:40] <d0de> if I have a string " str = '<img src="foo" />' " and I do something like $(str).text() or $(str).filter() or similar, does the image get loaded even though it's not in the DOM?
[08:34:49] <jParkton> I mean .arc() hand is my var for the hand :)
[08:35:19] <BillCriswell> d0de: Try it and see.
[08:35:36] <BillCriswell> Open up the dev tools and look at the network panel.
[08:36:18] <d0de> fair enough :P
[08:36:49] <BillCriswell> d0de: I don't think most people know that kind of detail off the top of their heads.
[08:37:21] <jParkton> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/jparkton/X4dv6/4/
[08:38:08] <jParkton> im trying to draw the face of the clock using arc() but im not too sure of the values I need to put in to draw it where my border on #face is now
[08:38:11] <d0de> it doesn't, as far as I can tell, which is good
[08:38:45] <BillCriswell> d0de: I assumed it wouldn't till it was added to the DOM itself, but I wasn't positive.
[08:39:04] <BillCriswell> jParkton: I'm not familiar with canvas. I'd just google arc() examples till something made sense.
[08:39:13] <jParkton> lol
[08:39:13] <Macaveli> Is it possible to have one button submit the form via Ajax and the other buttons do a normal form submit?
[08:39:14] <jParkton> ok
[08:39:33] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: Yes.
[08:40:28] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, how? Because I do now this.  https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/d9d471256e71f8c8a712
[08:40:45] <Macaveli> And because the .submit() every form submit gets triggered
[08:41:35] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: I'd look at the button that triggered the submission in the submit event, if it's the register button, do one thing, if it's not,do the other.
[08:42:18] <shoky> jParkton: i made this yesterday like a minute after you left.. http://jsfiddle.net/WF4Ka/1/
[08:42:31] <d0de_> BillCriswell, what were you saying in response to my question please? Sorry, I dropped
[08:43:03] <BillCriswell> "d0de: I assumed it wouldn't till it was added to the DOM itself, but I wasn't positive."
[08:43:54] <d0de_> thanks!
[08:44:13] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, this is not possible because $("#ajaxform").submit (e)-> is triggered every time the form is submit it's not possible to see the difference in what submitted it
[08:44:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does anyone know how to add data-attributes to rows with jquery datatables.net?
[08:45:17] <duch_kazatel> gooood morning
[08:45:48] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: I understnad that, you' have to change things.
[08:46:02] <shoky> Macaveli: $('#ajaxform')[0].submit()  will submit the form without going through your submit handler
[08:47:24] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: http://jsbin.com/nulazifa/1/edit?html,js,output is what I was thinking?
[08:47:40] <d0de_> Aha. This is probably obvious to you guys, but it turns out that if you do $($.parseHTML()) on something with an image in it, it loads the image
[08:47:55] <d0de_> like http://jsfiddle.net/zvQY2/
[08:49:53] <BillCriswell> d0de_: the .parseHTML() isn't needed here I don't think.
[08:50:57] <bberry> is there a way to write this so that the elements selected will have BOTH classes? $("#list").on("click", ".class1, .class2", function(){ //do stuff });
[08:51:12] <shoky> .class1.class2
[08:51:17] <d0de_> BillCriswell, i originally added it because without it, jQuery would interpret things like '***' in the HTML as selectors, and choke
[08:51:28] <bberry> kk
[08:51:28] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, thanks for the jsbin
[08:51:29] <d0de_> in the HTML string, I mean
[08:51:32] <Macaveli> I will try it t
[08:51:36] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: No problem.
[08:51:49] <BillCriswell> d0de_: You sure about that?
[08:52:23] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ what version of jquery are you using?
[08:52:54] <shoky> any jquery version doesn't know html if it doesn't explicitly look like html
[08:53:17] <duch_kazatel> weren't there bugs that recently got resolved around that?
[08:53:27] <shoky> what if my html looks like:   div
[08:53:45] <shoky> my html snippet, that is
[08:54:00] <d0de_> 1.11.1 - it was happening yesterday but I can't seem to reproduce it in the fiddle, perhaps it was happening somewhere else
[08:54:03] <BillCriswell> Would it need to start with a '<' to work?
[08:54:15] <shoky> why? can't i just have the word "div"  as my html
[08:54:34] <duch_kazatel> to the source!
[08:54:35] <shoky> browsers are fine with it
[08:55:11] <BillCriswell> That went right in as a text node.
[08:55:22] <d0de_> yeah, things like this were happening -> http://jsfiddle.net/zvQY2/1/
[08:55:34] <shoky> ^^
[08:55:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How does this work? http://datatables.net/examples/server_side/ids.html - I don't see any data-id attributes on that table...
[08:56:31] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob it uses javascript for everything instead.
[08:57:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but how to use this: "{string} DT_RowId - Add an ID to the TR element"
[08:57:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> This example below shows DT_RowId being used to add information to the table. In addition objects are used as the data source for the rows.
[08:57:26] <BillCriswell> d0de_: That works with newer jQuery.
[08:57:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I don't see where that ID gets added to the row - it's there, but I don't know how
[08:58:15] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob that's in the data.
[08:58:20] <shoky> BillCriswell: you sure?
[08:58:22] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob check out the Ajax tab on that page.
[08:58:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh
[08:58:35] <d0de_> BillCriswell, TY
[08:58:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the server script has to pass it
[08:58:44] <BillCriswell> shoky: Yes, http://jsbin.com/comajada/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:58:49] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob the data should contain it, yes.
[08:59:05] <shoky> BillCriswell: that's .append,  not $()
[08:59:11] <BillCriswell> Dammit.
[08:59:19] <duch_kazatel> yeah i was about to say...
[08:59:41] <d0de_> BillCriswell, actually, are you sure? it fails on the fiddle with 2.x (edge)
[08:59:53] <BillCriswell> How do I never find myself in the types of situations where I need to figure this shit out?
[08:59:59] <shoky> d0de_: keep using $.parseHTML ;p
[09:00:11] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell you're not dorking around with crazy text :)
[09:01:10] <BillCriswell> Yeah, true
[09:02:39] <d3m0n> Is it normal to get a 301 Moved Permanently if I am calling a page in a different folder than the ajax call
[09:03:22] <duch_kazatel> d3m0n not really - 301s are a server configuration.
[09:03:26] <duch_kazatel> you're redirecting users.
[09:03:52] <d3m0n> Hrm
[09:04:13] <duch_kazatel> your issue has nothing to do with jquery and everything to do with your server :)
[09:04:42] <d3m0n> Ok thanks duch_kazatel
[09:08:20] <d0de_> shoky, unfortunately I can't, because I need to get the length of the text without loading the images :(
[09:08:37] <ChgMuc> http://jsfiddle.net/TDu6e/
[09:08:48] <ChgMuc> I have a problem in this script
[09:09:06] <ChgMuc> always takes the first selection and creates a loop
[09:10:15] <decx> with the event.target this looks like a click function. and you're setting up another click handler in there, that cant be good
[09:10:24] <duch_kazatel> was just about to say that.
[09:10:32] <duch_kazatel> bind handlers once, determine logic from there.
[09:11:18] <duch_kazatel> aaaand https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core/init.js#L11-L13 - BillCriswell d0de_ shoky
[09:11:37] <duch_kazatel> follow up with line 27
[09:11:59] <ChgMuc> what happen is I'm doing a downloader files, so the user clic the file and the download icon is activated and then if I clic the download icon automatically download the file, and work ok but just the first time
[09:12:00] <BillCriswell> I was sort of on to something with it having to start with a < ?
[09:12:11] <ChgMuc> because then continues donwloading the same file
[09:12:26] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[09:12:38] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc could you share more of your js along with your html?
[09:13:13] <ChgMuc> I have php
[09:13:25] <ChgMuc> do you want see it?
[09:13:27] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc >.> you're rendering html.
[09:13:29] <shoky> duch_kazatel yep that's what i meant by explicitly looking like html
[09:13:56] <d0de_> duch_kazatel, shoky, thanks
[09:14:20] <ChgMuc> I'm doing all with ajax calls , the only html is a table
[09:14:34] <d0de_> that means I can just do an ugly hack like http://jsfiddle.net/zvQY2/4/ :D
[09:14:54] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc where are you calling activeset() from?
[09:14:57] <ChgMuc> I'm populate all data from server folder directly through php
[09:15:15] <duch_kazatel> because this line shouldn't be in that handler: $(".actfile").on('click', function() {
[09:15:24] <ChgMuc> from a short html tag that I have in my php script
[09:15:56] <bowenac> I am using php and ajax to update records in a db, after each update or no update I am adding 1 to the counter. I can get this to display when the ajax is done, but how can I display it to the user each time the counter gets updated?
[09:16:20] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc i think you're confused about how JS works >.> do you mean you're running activeset() every time you run an ajax call?
[09:16:28] <bowenac> right now I am just using echo at the end of the ajax file which the success function gets that value
[09:17:09] <ChgMuc> no
[09:17:29] <ChgMuc> I'm going to see you a image secuence of onlive working
[09:17:34] <duch_kazatel> please don't :(
[09:17:38] <duch_kazatel> that's not going to help me.
[09:17:54] <duch_kazatel> bowenac use the done() callback instead, and your question seems strange.  how do you want it to display?
[09:18:12] <naeluh_fri> yo !
[09:18:20] <duch_kazatel> whuddup naeluh_fri
[09:18:32] <bowenac> I am using done sorry... I couldnt get success to work. I just want it to display like Processing # of total
[09:18:46] <naeluh_wed> going pretty well ! How you doing !
[09:18:53] <bowenac> So when it is done I can echo anything but I want to learn how to show the status as it is running the script
[09:19:18] <duch_kazatel> bowenac "how to show the status" - you mean you want to display what "Step" of the ajax the user is on?
[09:19:27] <bowenac> If I can do that then I can use a progress bar etc
[09:19:42] <Stormrazer> Hi guys, is there any allready made solution for jquery shadow generator , like a plugin similar to colorpicker, need to implement it in wordpress backend?
[09:19:42] <bowenac> yes after each step has completed send it back to the user to see
[09:19:59] <bowenac> like a progress bar
[09:20:05] <duch_kazatel> bowenac if you mean the ajax steps, check out the global ajax events.
[09:20:29] <duch_kazatel> if you want server data, that's a whole different thing - there are some techniques out there for that.
[09:21:47] <duch_kazatel> bowenac that make sense?
[09:22:28] <bowenac> Maybe I am typing it confusing haha sorry. So I run my ajax.php file, at the top I'm getting the total post count, then in my foreach loop if I update a record I am using $count++, if I don't update a record I am using $count++... each time this $count++ gets triggered I would like to update the front end with the current $count
[09:22:31] <bowenac> Does that make sense?
[09:23:08] <bowenac> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22686298/streaming-progress-in-ajax-from-php-server-processing-database
[09:23:15] <bowenac> kind of like this I will try something like this out...
[09:23:17] <duch_kazatel> just include that number as apart of your response to the frontend.
[09:23:33] <bowenac> yea but I only get the response when its done
[09:23:39] <bowenac> not while it is processing the loop
[09:23:57] <duch_kazatel> aaah you want the database progress.
[09:24:08] <bowenac> if I put it in the loop I will get $count for each line it won't overwrite the previous
[09:24:22] <duch_kazatel> bowenac what loop?
[09:24:25] <bowenac> I just want one line showing the update so I can use that number to get the percent to fill the percentage bar
[09:24:35] <bowenac> foreach loop where I am updating records in the db
[09:24:46] <ChgMuc> http://imgur.com/F9WxEM8
[09:24:48] <duch_kazatel> bowenac that's a php question - something i know very little about >.>
[09:24:52] <ChgMuc> this Is what I'm doing
[09:24:59] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc that's not going to help me much tbh.
[09:25:15] <bowenac> isn't it the same concept?
[09:25:22] <ChgMuc> at least for you imagine what I'm doing
[09:25:27] <bowenac> I mean if I put it in the response I am only going to get it when its done
[09:25:33] <bowenac> not while it is running the script
[09:25:45] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc that doesn't give me any info about your html or js other than assumptions.
[09:25:57] <duch_kazatel> bowenac oh yeah, that's why you need sessions.
[09:26:05] <duch_kazatel> like what that SO thing was telling you.
[09:26:17] <ChgMuc> duch_kazatel : can I show you my php script
[09:26:22] <ChgMuc> is really hsort
[09:26:24] <ChgMuc> short*
[09:26:32] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc i don't know PHP.
[09:26:33] <duch_kazatel> sorry.
[09:26:42] <jParkton> can someone help me understand the arc() parameters so I can draw the face correctly http://jsfiddle.net/jparkton/WF4Ka/2/
[09:26:52] <shoky> jParkton: saw my msg?
[09:27:08] <jParkton> oh missed it sorry
[09:27:10] <jParkton> one sec
[09:27:12] <ChgMuc> I have stored the url of file in this var  :::  var relatxx = $(".activecl").data('key');
[09:27:31] <shoky> jParkton: not about the arc() but, <shoky> jParkton: i made this yesterday like a minute after you left.. http://jsfiddle.net/WF4Ka/1/
[09:27:53] <jParkton> dang
[09:27:55] <ChgMuc> I inspect the html with firebug and each one file have the according key data attribute with ok route
[09:28:02] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc try rephrasing your question... i am looking at your code - what was your particular problem?
[09:28:22] <ChgMuc> The problem is that always download the first file
[09:28:36] <ChgMuc> isn't cleaning the var that content the url
[09:28:49] <jParkton> I struggle for three days on it and you band it out in ten minutes
[09:28:50] <jParkton> lol
[09:29:03] <jParkton> plus mine is 5 times as long
[09:29:05] <jParkton> fml
[09:29:05] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc aaaah i get it - var relatxx = $(".activecl").data('key'); is grabbing the first data('key') of that selector.
[09:29:22] <decx> did you learn anything about canvas in these 3 das jParkton? if so then time well spent :p
[09:29:32] <decx> next time it'll only take 1 day
[09:29:34] <jParkton> I did!
[09:29:39] <decx> then you churn out something in 10 minutes as weel
[09:29:40] <decx> l
[09:29:50] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc you need to put that logic into your click handler and make it relative to the thing you clicked.
[09:29:52] <jParkton> I learned you cannot append elements to canvas like a div
[09:29:53] <jParkton> lol
[09:29:57] <Macaveli> I need to show hide blocks en mass is there an easier way to do this ? I now do this: http://pastie.org/private/kc9mf3qkblg06ehnnpsig
[09:30:00] <ChgMuc> each one is launched the event would should store the new var
[09:30:00] <jParkton> that took me a full day or failing
[09:30:37] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc show me the code where you're calling this from - the rendered HTML please.
[09:31:01] <decx> i failed like a year with canvas and still can't do anything interesting jParkton ^^
[09:31:14] <jParkton> sweet
[09:31:18] <ChgMuc> <li class='celllev filw'><a onClick='activeset(event)' data-key='".$opt."'>".str_replace('_', ' ', strtolower($opt))."</a></li>
[09:31:20] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc because what you're saying doesn't make any sense - var relatxx = $(".activecl").data('key'); has no context of where things are happening/the event it came from.  it's finding the first element that matches $(".activecl") and story its data('key')
[09:31:22] <jParkton> at least I am not alone lol
[09:31:37] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc don't call events like that.  bind using .on() - and that's your problem.
[09:31:50] <duch_kazatel> ChgMuc let me cook up an example for you.
[09:32:15] <ChgMuc> yes i know to use the .on('click', function(){}---
[09:32:19] <ChgMuc> is well
[09:32:39] <ChgMuc> But necesary I need to do it for this way in this case
[09:32:46] <duch_kazatel> no, it isn't necessary at all.
[09:32:54] <duch_kazatel> your code is saying "when you click this link, find me the first $(".activecl") and get me it's data('key') and store that.
[09:33:14] <ChgMuc> why the first?
[09:33:27] <ChgMuc> just there one record with that class
[09:33:53] <shoky> jParkton: and arc params are:  centerX, centerY, radiusLength, startAngle, endAngle
[09:34:00] <duch_kazatel> i give up.  until i can see rendered html and js, i can't help you.
[09:34:08] <shoky> jParkton: where the angles are in radians (from 0 to 2pi)
[09:34:55] <d0de_> I have a bunch of asynchronous functions running. I want to do something when they all finish. What should I use? They can all return a value when finished if that helps
[09:35:04] <shoky> jParkton: so here's an example of drawing the circle  http://jsfiddle.net/WF4Ka/3/
[09:35:35] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ promises.
[09:35:40] <BillCriswell> so round.
[09:36:08] <duch_kazatel> such round.  so circle/
[09:36:21] <shoky> could be rounder ;s
[09:37:11] <decx> yeah it totally clips and top and bottom
[09:37:12] <BillCriswell> wow much radius.
[09:37:19] <shoky> lol
[09:37:22] <decx> and left and right
[09:37:28] <duch_kazatel> dammit shoky get your shit together
[09:37:33] <duch_kazatel> that isn't round
[09:37:55] * shoky runs away in shame, falls over
[09:38:01] * duch_kazatel points and laughs
[09:38:03] <decx> it's a rectangle with border-radius: 80%
[09:38:16] <d0de_> I have a hard time understanding promises. The jQuery docs page only discusses promises attached to DOM elements. Is is pretty much the same for functions that don't interact with the DOM?
[09:38:55] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ yep.  promises are for all async operations.  read up on deferred objects - that should help you a little more.
[09:42:47] <jParkton> so in http://jsfiddle.net/WF4Ka/3/ what is r in this? radius length?
[09:43:14] <jParkton> also its hard to make this into an 'arm'
[09:43:49] <shoky> jParkton: r is the radius length. what's not clear ?
[09:44:04] <jParkton> what is the radius?
[09:44:10] <jParkton> or the circumference?
[09:44:24] <jParkton> the circ of my canvas?
[09:44:25] <decx> if you want to use assets for your clockhands you'll have to use .rotate instead of the path
[09:44:28] <shoky> the radius is half the .. whatever its called
[09:44:34] <MikeD_> diameter
[09:44:42] <shoky> ^
[09:44:46] <jParkton> decx: I think so too
[09:44:57] <shoky> jParkton: the radius is the length of the red hand
[09:45:03] <BillCriswell> Whenever I plan to go to a meetup it's pouring.
[09:45:04] <jParkton> ohhh
[09:45:10] <jParkton> ok
[09:45:12] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell sounds ominous
[09:45:18] <jParkton> yeah I think I need rotate
[09:45:43] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: such ominous
[09:45:46] <jParkton> it makes it weird when I try to make them different lengths
[09:45:46] <BillCriswell> dammit.
[09:45:57] <d0de_> duch_kazatel, is this right? http://jsfiddle.net/3L9KJ/1/
[09:45:58] <BillCriswell> Speaking too much like doge.
[09:46:35] <MikeD_> jParkton: you know "shapes" is preschool stuff, and radius/diameter/circumference is [at worst] high school maths ?
[09:46:58] <jParkton> imma rejoin on konversation irssi is hard to follow unless im focused on it
[09:47:00] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ some of us don't remember all that math.
[09:47:02] <decx> well that's a long time gone to forget all that crap
[09:47:19] <jParkton> he is just being an asshole
[09:47:26] <jParkton> theres one in every room
[09:47:37] <MikeD_> and now there's one less?
[09:48:04] <duch_kazatel> well, that elevated quickly
[09:48:12] <decx> you're all poopiefaces
[09:48:32] <decx> that's poo pie, fyi ^^
[09:48:36] <BillCriswell> Here it goes.
[09:48:45] <duch_kazatel> guuuuyyyyyzzzz
[09:48:50] <duch_kazatel> stop fighting!
[09:49:14] <MikeD_> poo * pi = area of the splatter when the shit hits the fan?
[09:49:35] <MikeD_> "squared"
[09:50:51] <d0de_> How would you use a promise with an API that was making the async function call for you? I call feed.load for each feed I'm loading and give it a callback function, and then the API calls my callback once for each feed. I want to do something when each callback call has finished
[09:51:48] <MikeD_> does your callback accept a callback?  you'd pass that through
[09:53:56] <jParkton> ok better
[09:53:59] <jParkton> :)
[09:53:59] <Macaveli> Why can't I select this "<input id="personal_info[LASTNAME]" name="personal_info[LASTNAME]" type="text" value="">" with $("#personal_info[LASTNAME]") nor this $(".personal_info[LASTNAME]")
[09:54:05] <shoky> jParkton:  http://jsfiddle.net/WF4Ka/4/
[09:54:28] <jParkton> gawl danggit
[09:54:35] <jParkton> stop being so awesome
[09:54:45] <shoky> jParkton: your job: add the hourly dots
[09:54:47] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: [ aren't valid in IDs I don't think.
[09:55:01] <jParkton> k
[09:55:10] <decx> jParkton http://jsfiddle.net/decx/58qqN/
[09:55:14] <d0de_> Macaveli, aren't square brackets illegal characters for an id?
[09:55:15] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, I have to escape them :)
[09:55:53] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: I don't think it should be int ere at all
[09:55:57] <d0de_> the bloody webchat window no longer autoscrolls when new messages appear, this is so annoying X|
[09:56:09] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell depends on if you're HTML4 or 5
[09:56:15] <pragma-> it's retarded to make ids look like arrays, regardless.
[09:56:18] <d0de_> MikeD_, I'm not quite sure what you mean. My callback function is called feedLoaded() and it gets called once for each feed, so somewhere from 10-20 times. Could you explain a bit more? I'm quite thick
[09:56:27] <duch_kazatel> 4 says "ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".")."
[09:56:48] <duch_kazatel> BUT 5 says it simply needs at least one character.
[09:57:11] <duch_kazatel> Macaveli i'd avoid using square brackets like that in your markup either way and find another way to relate data data in your backend.
[09:57:12] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Interesting.
[09:57:26] <Macaveli> alright duch_kazatel
[09:57:43] <BillCriswell> personal_info_last could work for the id, person_info[last] is totally cool in a name, though.
[09:57:53] <d0de_> I guess I could use an object, and have each callback change a flag when it's finished, and then have a function that does something once all the flags have been changed
[10:00:52] <Felsangom> Hello, may I get some help?
[10:00:56] <decx> no

[10:01:44] <duch_kazatel> Felsangom what's up?
[10:02:40] <Felsangom> I'm using drag, drop and sort on two lists, and I would like to prevent items to be dragged twice to the droppable list
[10:02:58] <Felsangom> but the 'accept' callback isn't working
[10:03:09] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Felsangom
[10:03:09] <b-ot> Felsangom: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:03:17] <Felsangom> http://jsfiddle.net/48ZFt/
[10:03:22] <duch_kazatel> yaaaaaaay
[10:04:30] <decx> i wouldnt compare texts
[10:04:48] <decx> if an item is successfully dropped add a flag to the original to make it undraggable
[10:05:19] <BillCriswell> d0de_: http://jsbin.com/kolohoru/1/edit?html,js,output thinking something like this?
[10:05:40] <BillCriswell> You have to run it manually.
[10:06:54] <Felsangom> but the drop callback on droppable list never get called
[10:07:06] <Felsangom> with connectToSortable
[10:08:51] <shoky> jParkton: and if you wanna get fancy... http://jsfiddle.net/WF4Ka/5/
[10:09:45] <decx> hm why do you raf the first draw?
[10:09:53] <BillCriswell> decx: Ugliest clock ever.
[10:10:12] <decx> hey i didnt make a clock, i drew an owl
[10:10:16] <shoky> decx: i donno, why not
[10:10:20] <duch_kazatel> 1 out of 5 stars: circle still not round.
[10:11:03] <decx> shoky i iife the loop and thought there was some reason for it ^^
[10:11:04] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/WF4Ka/6/
[10:11:31] <d0de_> BillCriswell, thanks very much, will try to understand
[10:11:56] <shoky> decx wat
[10:12:13] <Felsangom> even if I just return false on accept callback, the item gets dropped
[10:12:21] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/8DUuq/ I did this clock years ago. I wish they made cheap versions of these.
[10:12:36] <decx> shoky wat wat... (function drawFrame(){ })()
[10:13:14] <decx> yeah dont these cots like hundreds of $
[10:13:22] <decx> for no reason whatsoever
[10:13:33] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[10:13:42] <BillCriswell> I think even thousands lol
[10:13:43] <shoky> decx: yea iife's confuse noobs, i'd rather avoid irrelvant questions ;p
[10:13:56] <duch_kazatel> iifes blow minds.
[10:14:22] <decx> hm true. how prospective ^^
[10:14:28] <d0de_> I'm trying to store HTML objects in an array with a key. Should this work? http://jsfiddle.net/RY5L7/ it doesn't atm
[10:14:43] <duch_kazatel> i remember that moment I "got" iifes - just like when I "got" partials.
[10:14:49] <decx> 5$ material cost and assembly in vietnam and then 995$ hipstertax
[10:14:57] <BillCriswell> decx: haha
[10:15:04] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ use an object instea.d
[10:15:30] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ not an array - js arrays aren't "keyed" the way you want.
[10:15:30] <BillCriswell> decx: If it was like... $50 I might buy one, but no way at the price they want.
[10:15:34] <berpcor> Hello
[10:15:36] <d0de_> duch_kazatel, but I need to sort it, so doesn't an array make sense?
[10:15:40] <decx> but sweet implementation BillCriswell very concise
[10:15:50] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ then you have to push into the array.
[10:15:55] <decx> i would expect more logic
[10:16:07] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ javascript doesn't have hashes or associative arrays.
[10:16:09] <BillCriswell> decx: It needs the minute dots around the face... and there's a few things I'd like to do differently looking at it now.
[10:16:15] <duch_kazatel> you have objectes with properties.  or plain arrays.
[10:16:20] <berpcor> $('ul.emphasis').children('li').css('color', 'red'); It selects not only direct children, although it should select only direct...
[10:16:53] <berpcor> Oops.
[10:16:56] <berpcor> My mistake.
[10:16:58] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ in that code, you're creating an array object and then not using the array - you're just attaching properties
[10:17:38] <Fraz> hey
[10:18:39] <Fraz> im creating a plugin that relies on another plugin. how can i call a function within thr plugin from the other plugin?
[10:19:09] <duch_kazatel> Fraz depends - does the other plugin expose that function at all?
[10:19:50] <decx> you want to put a plugin in a plugin so you can plugin in your plugin? we're gonna need an exhibit *chuckle*
[10:19:57] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[10:20:11] <duch_kazatel> and please - xzibit
[10:20:13] <Fraz> im writing both plugins, so yes im trying to expose the function. but when trying to call it it, its undefined
[10:20:28] <Fraz> i think maybe im not returning the instance properly or something
[10:20:28] <decx> writing exhibit is funnier imho
[10:20:32] <Fraz> 1 min
[10:20:44] <d0de_> duch_kazatel, bugger, this is over my head again. I've just tried again with push() and that doesn't seem to work either. Can you see what I'm trying to do? I need to sort the HTML objects by the date field that's passed to the function, but I don't know the best way
[10:21:02] <wild_oscar> if retrieveDispenser() returns an array, and retrieveDispenser()[1]  yields the element [Object { type="Dispensed",  quantity="ytu",  date="",  more...}]....how do I access its properties?
[10:21:35] <Fraz> decx, hehe. No im writing a transition editor that uses a timelime and im writing the timeline as a seperate plugin so it can be used seperately
[10:21:41] <wild_oscar> retrieveDispenser()[1].type is yielding me undefined
[10:21:52] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ the problem is you can't do what you want with an array - arrays have strictly numeric keys.  and objects don't have to honor order.
[10:22:15] <decx> wouldnt it be retrieveDispenser()[1][0].type?
[10:22:54] <wild_oscar> ah! indeed it would decx. cheers!
[10:22:58] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ you have 2 choices - push objects into the array in the correct order, or move your logic so they're read out in the correct order.
[10:24:00] <BillCriswell> wild_oscar: http://jsbin.com/kolohoru/2/edit?js,console works.
[10:25:53] <d0de_> Maybe I could store them in an object keyed by numerical date, store the dates in an array, sort the array, then use the sorted keys to retrieve them from the object in the correct order?
[10:26:06] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ that could work, too.
[10:26:36] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ but at that point you might as well do my first idea - create objects of each pairing and push those into the array.
[10:27:00] <Fraz> im doing something like thi http://pastebin.com/4pfj3aYb
[10:27:28] <d0de_> it's just that I'm having a spot of trouble getting that to work
[10:27:37] <d0de_> blast, I've let an entire pot of tea go cold sitting right in front of me
[10:28:04] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ mind showing me what your data looks like with that fiddle?
[10:28:06] <duch_kazatel> i can show you.
[10:28:07] <duch_kazatel> it's easy.
[10:28:14] <Fraz> line 48 = test() is not a function
[10:28:44] <Fraz> crap like 46 should be PluginTwo() ignore that though
[10:29:01] <arbiter34> can someone help me out with this.... http://pbrd.co/1lRmHhM
[10:29:28] <duch_kazatel> Arby01 wat
[10:29:32] <duch_kazatel> err, arbiter34
[10:29:43] <arbiter34> having issues with selector stored in variable
[10:30:35] <duch_kazatel> arbiter34 what's the issue?
[10:30:41] <duch_kazatel> looks like it's working.
[10:30:57] <arbiter34> take a closer look at the picture
[10:31:12] <arbiter34> it's not, it works when I manually type in the selector in quotes, but not when I use the vairable
[10:31:14] <arbiter34> *variable
[10:31:31] <duch_kazatel> could you fiddle up what you're doing so I can play with it?
[10:32:40] <arbiter34> attempting to...
[10:32:48] <d0de_> oh hell
[10:33:13] <d0de_> I had a flipping typo, elementsStorageArray instead of elementStorageArray, that's why nothing was working
[10:33:19] <duch_kazatel> hah
[10:33:21] <duch_kazatel> that'd do it!
[10:34:01] <blindMoe> anyone happen to know of a js script that will grab you and your followers images using js?  There are a million for grabbing your images but they don't include your followers
[10:34:08] <blindMoe> or people you follow I should say
[10:35:02] <jParkton> followers being....
[10:35:15] <arbiter34> duch_kazatel I'm not entirely sure how to setup it up in jsfiddle, it's on a sharepoint site
[10:35:20] <blindMoe> jParkton: people you follow on instagram
[10:35:35] <jParkton> doesnt instagram have an API?
[10:35:45] <blindMoe> yes
[10:35:49] <duch_kazatel> arbiter34 http://jsfiddle.net/t8zdr/
[10:36:06] <duch_kazatel> arbiter34 are you sure jquery is loaded and available on that page?
[10:36:30] <jParkton> so get the script to get your images and add a function to pull images from others according to the API
[10:36:52] <arbiter34> duch_kazatel yes, because in that same pic I successfully use jquery when using '#id' instead of var
[10:37:04] <duch_kazatel> arbiter34 try using jQuery instead of $
[10:37:12] <blindMoe> jParkton: I am well aware I can use the api to pull the images... I am just not looking to reinvent the wheel if someone else already offers a script that does it
[10:37:25] <d0de_> duch_kazatel, everything seems to be working now, thanks so much for your help. I couldn't work out why push() wasn't working before!
[10:37:26] <duch_kazatel> because chrome aliases $ for querySelectorAll in the console
[10:37:37] <duch_kazatel> d0de_ :) glad i could help.  sometimes we just need a rubber duck.
[10:37:56] <duch_kazatel> arbiter34 because like I pointed out, it works just fine: jsfiddle.net/t8zdr/
[10:39:34] <arbiter34> duch_kazatel I'm not so sure of that
[10:39:51] <duch_kazatel> arbiter34 try using the full name jQuery instead of $ on your local site.
[10:40:06] <arbiter34> duch_kazatel I did to no result
[10:40:19] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/commandline-api#selector
[10:40:35] <duch_kazatel> what happens when you run just jQuery - nothing else.
[10:41:34] <arbiter34> http://pbrd.co/1lRo683
[10:41:58] <duch_kazatel> then i dunno.  screenshots are terribly unhelpful tbh. can you share your code in a fiddle?
[10:42:27] <duch_kazatel> also: what version of jquery are you using?
[10:42:34] <arbiter34> 1.8.3
[10:43:26] <arbiter34> I'm not sure how you want me to use a fiddle from sharepoint stuff
[10:43:48] <duch_kazatel> arbiter34 i want you to fiddle an isolated example.  like I did here: http://jsfiddle.net/t8zdr/
[10:43:53] <duch_kazatel> because this works 100% fine.
[10:44:09] <duch_kazatel> even if I bump the jquery version down it works.
[10:49:04] <arbiter34> duch_kazatel I'm working on it
[10:49:16] <arbiter34> I understand why, I'm just unsure exactly how
[10:51:03] <duch_kazatel> arbiter34 you have a few component parts to your problem: 1 - you're building up a string somehow and storing that in a var.  2 - you have some markup (the tagnames aren't relevant in this case). 3 - you're selecting said markup with said string.
[10:51:59] <duch_kazatel> also: another thing to try first is to run all your stuff in a file you're linking to the page and see if that changes the behavior.
[10:53:01] <Fraz> does jquery transit support browsers without css3 support?
[10:54:04] <duch_kazatel> Fraz per http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/ - "If you would like to fallback to classic animation when transitions aren't supported, just manually redefine .transitition to .animate."
[10:54:38] <duch_kazatel> also: Transit degrades older browsers by simply not doing the transformations (rotate, scale, etc) while still doing standard CSS (opacity, marginLeft, etc) without any animation. Delays and durations will be ignored.
[10:58:23] <arbiter34> duch_kazatel I can't figure out the css stylesheet to use, it's not displaying right
[10:59:12] <duch_kazatel> give me the single line of HTML and the abstracted JS
[10:59:27] <arbiter34> duch_kazatel I think I figured it out
[10:59:27] <duch_kazatel> if you're trying to recreate the whole page/part of the page, you're doing too much.
[10:59:33] <duch_kazatel> okay
[10:59:40] <arbiter34> it was the \\'s
[10:59:47] <arbiter34> no I was just recreating one row
[10:59:58] <duch_kazatel> i didn't need the styling ;)
[11:00:09] <duch_kazatel> and the \\s should matter... like in the example i showed you.
[11:00:40] <arbiter34> I was building my string using a replace though
[11:01:07] <arbiter34> so I thought I needed string.replace(/,/g, "\\\\,") instead of string.replace(/,/g, "\\")
[11:01:47] <duch_kazatel> kay
[11:02:02] <duch_kazatel> fwiw, i would avoid using commas in IDs anyway.
[11:02:20] <arbiter34> it's not me
[11:02:23] <arbiter34> it's sharepoint
[11:02:43] <arbiter34> I have limited control over what is happening, I'm doing client-side rendering
[11:02:56] <duch_kazatel> kay
[11:03:06] <arbiter34> I appreciate the help
[11:04:04] <Tomashe> hey guys, how do i remove key from my array
[11:04:18] <Tomashe> i want the key with everything in it to be gone
[11:06:40] <jParkton> .pop()
[11:06:45] <Tomashe> hmm
[11:06:53] <Fraz> thanks for pointing that out duch_kazatel
[11:07:03] <duch_kazatel> Fraz yep
[11:07:26] <Tomashe> pop() remove the last item
[11:07:29] <Tomashe> i want to know what item
[11:07:35] <Fraz> any idea if its possible to jump to specific time for an animation/transition?
[11:07:40] <Fraz> using transit or otherwise
[11:08:36] <berpcor> http://laravel.io/bin/B9mlJ
[11:08:40] <berpcor> Doesn't work.
[11:08:42] <berpcor> Why?
[11:08:57] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe use splice instead.
[11:09:07] <Tomashe> yes but i only have the array key
[11:09:11] <FunnyLookinHat> Anyone have suggestions for style-guides for writing masssive amounts of jQuery ( besides the obvious splitting into files for development and minifying together for deployment ) ?  Trying to do something better than a file that's a thousand lines long just listing event listeners, etc.  :)
[11:09:15] <Tomashe> array.splice() ?
[11:09:35] <Tomashe> array.splice(key,1) ?
[11:09:36] <Tomashe> like that
[11:09:52] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
[11:10:49] <duch_kazatel> berpcor http://jsfiddle.net/8CtV4/ works fine.
[11:12:30] <berpcor> duch_kazatel: Strange... That's all my code - http://laravel.io/bin/yMOMo
[11:13:35] <duch_kazatel> berpcor ah - you're not waiting for doc ready.  can't bind to something that doesn't exist yet.
[11:13:41] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/8CtV4/3/
[11:13:56] <duch_kazatel> wrap with $(function() { }); instead of your iife.
[11:15:52] <Tomashe> if my array looks like that
[11:15:54] <Tomashe> array[i]['phonenumber']
[11:16:01] <Tomashe> if i run each loop on it
[11:16:24] <Tomashe> with value as the element, why does value.phonenumber is undefined
[11:16:25] <berpcor> duch_kazatel: I wrapped and it's worked. But how does he doing that - http://clip2net.com/s/icxEOx (his code is working). I am watching Jeffrey Way's video.
[11:16:46] <Tomashe> it say "can not read property on undefined
[11:18:23] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Tomashe
[11:18:23] <b-ot> Tomashe: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:18:50] <duch_kazatel> berpcor because the code is after the html
[11:18:53] <Tomashe> the problem is that i can not use it , the testing are on my phone. i see the results on logCat of eclipse
[11:19:14] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe i can't help unless i can see your data.
[11:19:24] <Tomashe> but i showed u how i set it
[11:19:34] <berpcor> Tomashe: Damn... exactly... Time to sleep ) Thanks.
[11:19:42] <Tomashe> array[i] = {}; array[i]['phonenumber']
[11:19:50] <berpcor> duch_kazatel: Damn... exactly... Time to sleep ) Thanks.
[11:20:00] <duch_kazatel> what are you enumerating on?
[11:20:06] <duch_kazatel> what are you setting that to?
[11:20:53] <Tomashe> http://pastie.org/private/ddxqcgxzrlcqcs14c658q
[11:21:30] <Tomashe> EmptyCheck() is jus check if its not empty or null or stuff like that
[11:22:17] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe console.log() the values you're trying to use.
[11:22:49] <duch_kazatel> actually what does that console.log(value) return on line 19?
[11:23:13] <Tomashe> i do it but on eclipse i just see [object,object]
[11:23:20] <Tomashe> i have no way to see the inside
[11:23:27] <duch_kazatel> then i can't help.
[11:23:34] <duch_kazatel> unless i can see all the data and a functioning example.
[11:23:35] <duch_kazatel> sorry
[11:23:49] <Tomashe> :/
[11:23:52] <Tomashe> ok
[11:23:54] <Tomashe> thanks
[11:24:34] <duch_kazatel> also - there's literally no reason for you to use $.each() down there.  i'd use a normal for loop instead.
[11:26:09] <Tomashe> isnt that the same
[11:26:40] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[11:26:48] <duch_kazatel> it's something to try either way.
[11:31:28] <Tomashe> for (var i = 0; i < value.length; i++) { 	if (EmptyCheck(value)===true) {array.splice(i,1);	}
[11:31:28] <Tomashe> 				
[11:31:29] <Tomashe> 			}
[11:31:33] <Tomashe> ok so this will do what i want right
[11:31:52] <duch_kazatel> dunno.  i'd have to see the data ;)
[11:32:22] <bowenac> anyway to get seperate responses in ajax request?
[11:33:06] <bowenac> I am trying to create a function to get the status of a script, then in that function I want to compare the numbers, if they do not equal eachother I want to trigger the function till they match
[11:33:07] <duch_kazatel> bowenac sure - separate requests/.
[11:33:17] <bowenac> But I can only get one response
[11:33:19] <bowenac> res
[11:33:39] <bowenac> do I need seperate ajax files for each request?
[11:33:48] <bowenac> and then use those to compare
[11:33:54] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:33:54] <bowenac> can you show an example
[11:34:13] <bowenac> I don't know what you are talking about I keep coming here for help and you just say something assuming I know what your talking about
[11:34:30] <bowenac> what do you mean separate requests... If I knew what you were talking about I would have done that by now haha
[11:35:30] <Groobda> bowenac : Get the var in jquery with json and is easy for separate what you want
[11:36:45] <duch_kazatel> Groobda they want to setup a progressbar that automatically updates with the status from their server.
[11:37:09] <Groobda> yes as well is simple
[11:37:36] <duch_kazatel> you need to stream info instead.
[11:37:36] <Groobda> I'm going to give an example*
[11:37:54] <BillCriswell> Aw shit 1.0 http://socket.io/blog/introducing-socket-io-1-0/
[11:38:01] <duch_kazatel> niiice
[11:38:10] <duch_kazatel> good milestone for them.
[11:39:00] <Groobda> http://jsfiddle.net/zj5E3/
[11:39:06] <Groobda> will be like this if with loader barf
[11:39:09] <Groobda> bar*
[11:39:17] <Groobda> what he want to do?
[11:39:24] <duch_kazatel> noe.
[11:39:32] <duch_kazatel> he want realtime status from his database.
[11:39:46] <bowenac> I dont have the data on the page lol
[11:39:47] <Groobda> haa
[11:39:53] <bowenac> its all coming from db
[11:39:57] <duch_kazatel> he's trying to setup a "push"
[11:40:13] <Groobda> bowenac : what are you trying to do?
[11:41:01] <bowenac> I am updating records in a db... On the front end I have a button that triggers the ajax to update the records. In the ajax file there is a foreach that loops through each post and updates what I need it to update if a match is found.
[11:41:10] <bowenac> So for each update I want to show the live status of the script
[11:41:39] <bowenac> So I am setting $i = 0 at first then using $i++ to update the counter. I need to send this counter info back to the user on the front end...
[11:42:07] <duch_kazatel> bowenac right - you need to use sessions or a push based setup with sockets or something.
[11:42:09] <ratsupremacy> Hmm, is there a wait to retain the .abort() method on a $.ajax, whilst still using the .then() promise?
[11:42:19] <bowenac> So I created a seperate ajax request that I created a table to insert the status count, and total post count so I can compare them to trigger the second status function if those two values do not match.
[11:42:38] <bowenac> but I guess I can't do that?
[11:42:52] <bowenac> yea I have not been able to find any decent example of this
[11:42:55] <bowenac> using sessions etc
[11:43:03] <bowenac> im pretty new to ajax
[11:43:52] <bowenac> can I not use a script inside the ajax.php to say like var total = "<?php echo $total;?>";
[11:44:11] <bowenac> and then send the var total value back as a response?
[11:44:31] <ratsupremacy> or does .then() turn it into a promise that isn't a jqXHR
[11:44:35] <Groobda> is like very weird
[11:44:46] <Groobda> you would should to do it of simplest way
[11:46:06] <Groobda> you want to pass something from php to jquery?
[11:47:46] <bowenac> yes
[11:48:07] <bowenac> or I guess I could do it on the front end compare the values from the db then trigger the ajax request when they dont match...
[11:48:50] <Groobda> is very simple man
[11:48:56] <bowenac> guess I can't do that either
[11:49:29] <Groobda> Inside your php script do this :: json_encode($your_var);
[11:49:42] <Groobda> echo json_encode($your_var);
[11:49:43] <Groobda> like this
[11:49:56] <bowenac> this is how I am starting the ajax http://pastebin.com/EWrhZ0RX
[11:50:16] <Groobda> and your var should to do a structure like ::  $your_var = array('some'=>'another something')
[11:50:30] <bowenac> and the ajax results http://pastebin.com/yAXrWdBc
[11:50:34] <Groobda> In jquery you bring using json
[11:50:43] <Groobda> do you know how?
[11:51:08] <NoiseEee> bowenac: thats not how you deliver results
[11:51:54] <NoiseEee> $output['imageID'] = $imageId; $output['published_posts'] = $published_posts; echo json_encode($output);
[11:51:58] <d0de_> in the chrome dev tools, is there any way to see what line of JS has triggered a network request?
[11:52:54] <arbiter34> d0de_ I thought it said right next to the request...
[11:53:31] <arbiter34> such as jquery-1.8.3.js:8434
[11:53:32] <bowenac> NoiseEee then what do I do with that I am left with {"imageID":"14","published_posts":"14"} on front end
[11:53:37] <arbiter34> under initiator
[11:53:42] <d0de_> oh lord, you're right, I had that column collapsed :<
[11:53:50] <arbiter34> haha that'll do it
[11:53:53] <d0de_> or squished rather
[11:53:54] <d0de_> thanks!
[11:53:57] <arbiter34> no problem
[11:55:25] <NoiseEee> bowenac: thats right - that's JSON.  then you can access the properties easily
[11:55:37] <NoiseEee> bowenac: google about it / fairly intro standard stuff
[12:00:46] <ratsupremacy> ever had jqXHR.abort() not actually fecking work?
[12:02:31] <ratsupremacy> the jqXHR says it is aborted, but the promise still succeeded
[12:02:31] <ratsupremacy> wtf
[12:02:36] <ratsupremacy> and chrome says it's 200
[12:04:08] <d0de_> I'm a catch 22. I want to use the output of text() to decide whether or not to load an HTML string and inject it as an element. But using text() via $(string).text() loads it as an element
[12:04:34] <d0de_> even though it's not in the DOM, it loads all images etc. referenced in the string
[12:04:49] <d0de_> like http://jsfiddle.net/UF2bV/
[12:05:21] <d0de_> and I can't strip out the images, because I using find() or filter() triggers the images to load in the same way
[12:06:30] <Uhkis> d0de_: try doing that in actual html and try again
[12:07:37] <d0de_> Uhkis, I'm not sure I understand what you mean
[12:08:34] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/UF2bV/2/
[12:09:27] <Uhkis> d0de: get it?
[12:10:42] <d0de> Uhkis, not yet - you'll have to forgive me, I'm a bit thick
[12:10:53] <jParkton> sexy
[12:13:12] <d0de> are you saying that jQuery can only perform the text() operation on the string by rendering it as HTML?
[12:14:22] <Uhkis> d0de: sorry, i'm a bit drunk, but even your earlier paste said 19 long string
[12:25:43] <d0de> this is a bit dirty, but I guess I could use a regular expression to remove all '<img' substrings from the string before I make it a jQuery object?
[12:29:18] <ngharo> d0de: .text() should only grab all textNodes
[12:29:19] <ngharo> not elements
[12:29:30] <ngharo> not understanding your problem
[12:29:58] <d0de> ngharo: it turns out that simply doing $(string) is enough to load all images referenced in an HTML string
[12:30:33] <ngharo> what is your goal?  an image preloader?
[12:31:34] <d0de> ngharo, I'm filtering through hundreds of rss entries and trying to decide which ones to display. Each entry is an HTML string. The problem is that I can't use the $() at all without loading all the images referenced in the string, hundreds of megabytes. I'd like to be able to use find(), filter() and remove() to get rid of images I don't want without loading them
[12:34:43] <d0de> my workaround at the moment is just to do as much filtering as possible in native JS, then only processing the entries I intend to actually inject in jQuery. But that still results in loading tons of images I never actually inject into the DOM
[12:35:33] <ngharo> yeah, i guess i'd just filter server side
[12:35:46] <ngharo> <img /> regex seems reasonable
[12:36:17] <d0de> gah, there is no server side unfortunately
[12:37:27] <d0de> it would be nice to include some images, if they were small enough, but there's obviously no way to know how big an image is without loading it :(
[12:41:15] <ngharo> could do HEAD requests and check for Content-Length of response
[12:41:27] <d0de> this is a bit pathetic, but I haven't used a regex in forever: what would match "<img" ?
[12:41:39] <ngharo> d0de: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15113910/jquery-parse-html-without-loading-images
[12:42:00] <d0de> ngharo, thanks very much! great :D
[13:12:06] <frank_o> Hello! How come one can't hover on and off `.test` consistently in this case? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/bY4Uz/1/ (mouseenter / hoverIntent combo)
[13:14:07] <naeluh_wed> 	hey can someone tell me where I am going wrong here ? I am trying to iterate through all the circle/clips so it appears to be one gif but I can figure out what to iterate through ? http://jsfiddle.net/PG5wv/3/ thanks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[13:22:11] <styles> What is {% %}
[13:22:33] <BillCriswell> styles: Looks like template code.
[13:22:47] <BillCriswell> Like <% %>... but {% %}.
[13:22:53] <BillCriswell> That's my brilliant explanation  anytway.
[13:23:14] <styles> lol well the sample uses jquery template but it doesn't seem to be evaling it, instead just printing it
[13:23:21] <styles> Let me check something 1 sec
[13:24:32] <styles> Yeah it's not that
[13:24:39] <styles> this is driving me bonkers
[13:27:24] <w00tb3ast> Anyone know how I can determine which file is causing an Origin not found in Access-Control-Allow-Origin header error in IE8?
[13:33:17] <duch_kazatel> by using the console?
[13:34:30] <w00tb3ast> the console just gives that error
[13:34:35] <w00tb3ast> it wont tell me which file is causing it
[13:35:16] <duch_kazatel> it should say to the right of the error.
[13:35:38] <w00tb3ast> nope
[13:36:07] <duch_kazatel> lucky for you i'm downloading an IE8 vm right now anyway.
[13:37:17] <naeluh_wed> hey can someone point in the right direction I am trying to iterate through all the canvas clip objects so they are all animating at the same time so it looks like one gif right now it only does the one on mousmove is there a way to iterate through all of them ?
[13:37:24] <naeluh_wed> http://jsfiddle.net/PG5wv/3/
[13:39:36] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast can you screenshot your console in the meantime?
[13:39:46] <w00tb3ast> yeah doing that right now
[13:41:14] <w00tb3ast> http://imgur.com/QvfYkbi
[13:41:38] <duch_kazatel> oh, you mean the IE11 debugger.
[13:41:51] <w00tb3ast> yeah I only have win 8.1
[13:42:04] <duch_kazatel> that's different than the IE8 question...
[13:42:07] <w00tb3ast> if you have actual IE8 I can give you a link
[13:42:20] <w00tb3ast> maybe you can let me know if it's still happening there
[13:42:23] <duch_kazatel> and that error means it's somewhere in the rendered markup.
[13:42:40] <duch_kazatel> look through the DOM explorer.
[13:43:38] <duch_kazatel> should be able to ctrl+f
[13:43:45] <w00tb3ast> well according to everything I've looked up about it it has to do with CORS and also is because of a script likely requesting a file through AJAX from a domain that doesn't match up with the domain the site is hosted on
[13:44:09] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast err, sort of.  that particular error means you're requesting from a remote resource that doesn't allow cross-domain magic.
[13:44:51] <w00tb3ast> What would I be looking for in the DOM?
[13:44:52] <duch_kazatel> so what are you requesting from?
[13:44:57] <duch_kazatel> $.ajax() i'd assume.
[13:44:59] <duch_kazatel> or a similar method.
[13:46:53] <naeluh_wed> anyone got any ideas ? I think if I make an array of all the gif object and then run that through my anmate loop with rAF I think that should work I believe
[13:47:32] <w00tb3ast> can't find one :S
[13:51:16] <opie-wrk> w00tb3ast: is the site public?
[13:51:20] <krambiorix> hi, how can i refresh DataTables_Table_1_info  ( X from X results)  in datatables?
[13:51:26] <w00tb3ast> yup www.neverdesign.net/SKLTN
[13:51:46] <naeluh_wed> HOLY SHIT I created a new gif object on every mouse move I my computer almost blew up
[13:51:48] <opie-wrk> w00tb3ast: when does it happen for you, on page load?
[13:51:52] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast i can read ;)
[13:51:55] <w00tb3ast> after page load
[13:52:15] <opie-wrk> only in ie8?
[13:52:23] <duch_kazatel> w00tb3ast i'm loading and it's all OK...
[13:52:26] <w00tb3ast> lower than IE8 gets the same error
[13:52:41] <duch_kazatel> real IE or emulated?
[13:52:46] <w00tb3ast> but like I said I only have IE 11 so emulated
[13:53:21] <w00tb3ast> I mean the other issue is that the scripts in the <!--[if lt IE 9]> aren't working it appears
[13:53:23] <opie-wrk> well, the problem with ie11 emulated, is that it ignores <-- ie8 lt --> type browser hints, plus it doesn't do proper agent mocking
[13:53:50] <opie-wrk> if you need to ie8 test you need to get the free vm from MS of win7 w/ ie8
[13:54:12] <w00tb3ast> ah right ok I guess I will grab and try that
[13:54:14] <opie-wrk> although, browser stack is really really nice too, and they include firebug into the vm so that helps debugging alot
[13:54:22] <opie-wrk> i'd try browserstack first
[13:54:40] <opie-wrk> there is a free trial i think, i use it now and again before i fire up the vm if shit is broken
[13:54:49] <w00tb3ast> rightio
[13:54:52] <w00tb3ast> I'll check it out
[13:55:07] <opie-wrk> i'm suprised you're not getting the cors issue in all the browsers, there must be more to it
[13:55:25] <w00tb3ast> Yeah I thought that was a bit odd but then i don't know enough about cors to understand it
[13:56:01] <frank_o> I got this box that expands on hover (after its progress loader is done animating): http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/WwD5V/4/embedded/result/
[13:56:04] <frank_o> But how come if you hover on and off quickly for a while, the timeout will go bananas and the box will start expanding even when you don't hover it?
[13:58:02] <opie-wrk> frank, my guess is that your animate calls are still running
[13:58:09] <opie-wrk> while you end up calling them again and again
[13:58:18] <opie-wrk> you need to call .stop() or something like that, i'd guess
[13:58:33] <frank_o> hmm
[13:58:49] <opie-wrk> check if an animate is still running before you call it, if so call stop or handle it
[13:58:54] <opie-wrk> you're likely stacking up animate calls
[13:59:11] <frank_o> was playing around with clearTimeout(); incase the setTimeouts were still counting but..
[13:59:16] <opie-wrk> nah
[13:59:24] <opie-wrk> clear timeout just stops the timeout
[13:59:35] <opie-wrk> animations are tracked by their own queue
[13:59:58] <opie-wrk> something simple may be, keep a global variable, animating = true|false
[14:00:20] <opie-wrk> then on the complete callback for animate set this to false, and before you animate set it to true, but only animate if it's false
[14:00:22] <opie-wrk> ya know?
[14:00:41] <opie-wrk> again, i'm just guessing here
[14:00:56] <frank_o> oh i tink ur definitely right here
[14:01:13] <opie-wrk> ohh, plus you have two animate calls in each
[14:01:21] <opie-wrk> you should combine that stuff into one if you can
[14:01:45] <frank_o> is that possible when its on two different elems?
[14:01:48] <opie-wrk> those animate calls don't block the code executation if i recall correctly
[14:02:26] <frank_o> and as for the global anim var, would i need some sorta "keep retrying until its false again"?
[14:02:53] <opie-wrk> i wouldn't but it's hard to say what you want to do exactly
[14:03:20] <frank_o> i just dont want it to go bananas like that :)
[14:03:36] <opie-wrk> best bet would be to check if mouse has left the area, then if it has when the enter animation has finished close it back down
[14:03:53] <opie-wrk> you know, cause the animations are fighting each other
[14:04:14] <opie-wrk> some people use like an animation reverse trick
[14:06:00] <opie-wrk> i forget how to use the bot, but i think this is what you'll want to check out http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[14:06:15] <opie-wrk> !help stop
[14:06:28] <dashbob> !help go
[14:07:04] <gthoma2> Anyone know a more reliable way to reset all radio and checkbox buttons to ui-btn-up state, other than the code I am using in this gist:  https://gist.github.com/galenthomasramos/be28b5ff4e2cfa923d2d   ?
[14:07:16] <gthoma2> using jquery mobile btw
[14:08:10] <BillCriswell> Hmm... in jQuery UI I figured a revert would happen before a drop with the drag and drop.
[14:08:37] <opie-wrk> how would it know when to revert if you never dropped it?
[14:09:01] <BillCriswell> opie-wrk: I do not know. It just felt right in my brain.
[14:09:40] <BillCriswell> Was thinking like a beforeDrop
[14:09:57] <opie-wrk> yeah, is there a beforedrop event?
[14:10:27] <BillCriswell> opie-wrk: Doesn't look like it.
[14:11:30] <BillCriswell> I have to do: $draggable.draggable({revert: function(droppable) { if( droppable.children().length === 1 ) }); to see if it's empty.
[14:11:46] <BillCriswell> I need to find a way to keep this code feeling more logical.
[14:13:08] <sadtaco> Is there something out there that will turn something that SORT OF looks like json, into json? Like the string '{foo:"bar"}'
[14:13:45] <sadtaco> JSON.parse is so specific. It has to be like "{\"foo\":\"bar\"}"
[14:14:57] <dashbob> '{"foo":"bar"}' doesn't work?
[14:15:27] <Sazpaimon__> $("#someid").css('max-width') gives me pixels in firefox, but percentage in chrome
[14:15:29] <Sazpaimon__> what gives?
[14:16:24] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({foo:'bar'}))
[14:16:56] <sadtaco> No, a tring that sort of looks like json
[14:17:01] <sadtaco> ie '{foo:"bar"}'
[14:17:21] <BillCriswell> .js JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({foo:'bar'}))
[14:17:26] <BillCriswell> >js JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({foo:'bar'}))
[14:17:36] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what I'm doing with robot.
[14:17:46] <BillCriswell> That works, though.
[14:18:05] <BillCriswell> js> JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({foo:'bar'}))
[14:18:10] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[14:18:27] <sadtaco> ...?
[14:18:29] <BillCriswell> js> console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({foo:'bar'})))
[14:18:33] <sadtaco> {foo:'bar'} is NOT a string
[14:18:33] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[14:18:35] <sadtaco> It's an object
[14:18:54] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: I know what I'm doing. =)
[14:19:11] <BillCriswell> js> return JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({foo:'bar'}))
[14:19:16] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[14:19:24] <BillCriswell> Not with this bot, but type that into your console.
[14:19:38] <sadtaco> .........................
[14:19:44] <sadtaco> {foo:'bar'} is NOT a string.
[14:19:55] <sadtaco> <sadtaco> Is there something out there that will turn something that SORT OF looks like json, into json? Like the ****string**** '{foo:"bar"}'
[14:20:03] <Sazpaimon__> anybody?
[14:20:15] <duch_kazatel> sadtaco you can't return "not json" as "json"
[14:20:28] <sadtaco> Well I need to turn it into an object.
[14:20:33] <duch_kazatel> parseJSON
[14:20:40] <sadtaco> I need to turn something that looks like a human typed object into an object
[14:20:50] <sadtaco> I tried $.parseJSON, same error that JSON.parse gave
[14:21:08] <systemfault> sadtaco: That human cannot type JSON?
[14:21:10] <duch_kazatel> i'll be back in a secon.
[14:21:17] <sadtaco> js> $.parseJSON("{foo:'bar'}");
[14:21:21] <sadtaco> systematik, lets assume so :)
[14:21:21] <b-ot> sadtaco: No output.
[14:21:50] <systemfault> sadtaco: Just punch the guy if he enters invalid JSON.
[14:22:01] <sadtaco> Not part of the application requirements.
[14:22:38] <systemfault> sadtaco: Change the requirements. Because the alternatives are 1) Write your own parser 2) Dumbly use eval()
[14:22:49] <opie-wrk> systemfault: scope creep
[14:22:52] <systemfault> 1) is a waste of time 2) has security implication
[14:23:06] <sadtaco> eval actually doesn't work either, if it DID that'd actually be fine since it's being JSON.stringified at the end which would remove anything bad
[14:23:16] <sadtaco> js> eval("{foo:'bar'}");
[14:23:20] <b-ot> sadtaco: No output.
[14:23:27] <sadtaco> Well
[14:23:28] <BillCriswell> JSON.stringify(eval('{foo:"bar"}'))
[14:23:29] <opie-wrk> yeah, i tried eval too. no go in chrome anyways
[14:23:29] <sadtaco> IT returns "bar"
[14:23:46] <BillCriswell> sadtaco: Wrap it in [ and ]
[14:23:59] <sadtaco> Odd.
[14:24:01] <sadtaco> Why does that work?
[14:24:17] <BillCriswell> BEcause foo: is a valid label.
[14:24:55] <frank_o> I got this box that expands on hover after the SVG timer is done: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/WwD5V/7/embedded/result/
[14:24:58] <BillCriswell> Have to run. Later.
[14:24:58] <frank_o> But right now it goes bananas if you hover on and off many times quickly. How come placing stop(true,true) before each animate() won't fix it?
[14:25:00] <sadtaco> Then how do I unwrap afterward?
[14:26:31] <sadtaco> Oh nevermind
[14:26:56] <sadtaco> js> JSON.parse( JSON.stringify(eval("[{foo:'bar'}]")[0] ) );
[14:27:02] <b-ot> sadtaco: No output.
[14:27:07] <sadtaco> Well thanks, bot.
[14:27:40] <Sazpaimon> any ideas why I'm having browser incompatabilities with jquery?
[14:27:50] <Sazpaimon> or rather, inconsistencies?
[14:28:53] <opie-wrk> Sazpaimon: nah, i'd check the forums if i were you, post a bug make a fiddle =/
[14:33:50] <sadtaco> Eh..
[14:34:31] <sadtaco> What would the regexp be to wrap everything until hitting a []{},space in quotations?
[14:34:51] <sadtaco> So I can turn "[foo,bar]" into "[\"foo\",\"bar\"]"
[14:37:18] <Jon47> what are you really trying to do, escape a string for json?
[14:37:53] <sadtaco> Yeah, jon47
[14:38:06] <Jon47> you know about JSON.stringify?
[14:38:08] <sadtaco> I want to make what looks like how a human would type an array or object, into an array or object.
[14:38:09] <sadtaco> Yes.
[14:40:51] <sadtaco> I just want to match everything that's not {}[], and wrap it in quotations.
[14:41:07] <Frenconect> Guys!!
[14:41:15] <sadtaco> That isn't already wrapped in quotations
[14:41:18] <Frenconect> what is  the best way to create a index three
[14:41:25] <Frenconect> tree*
[14:41:44] <Frenconect> for to read the complete path
[15:06:59] <enclaved> popeyes has waffle chicken tenders
[15:07:05] <enclaved> wrong channel
[15:07:09] <enclaved> but ya'll wanted to know that anyway
[15:07:58] <frank_o> Anyone know why my SVG pie timer (http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/99vTf/3/) won't play when I insert it with jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/99vTf/2/ ? I'm trying to reset the timer on each hover..
[15:13:55] <sadtaco> How do I match everything except {}[], and leading/trailing spaces and wrap it in quotations, as long as it's not already wrapped in quotations? I can't figure out the proper regex.  IE turn '[foo,"bar", foo bar]' into '["foo","bar", "foo bar"]' or something valid like that.
[15:30:43] <duch_kazatel> sadtaco you still doing that "parse string as json" deal?
[15:31:11] <Tomashe> i wonder if handlebarsjs can do {{#if message == 'some text'}}
[15:31:12] <sadtaco> yes
[15:31:33] <duch_kazatel> what was the example string?
[15:31:50] <sadtaco> How do I match everything except {}[], and leading/trailing spaces and wrap it in quotations, as long as it's not already wrapped in quotations? I can't figure out the proper regex.  IE turn '{array:[foo,"bar", foo bar]}' into '{"array":["foo","bar", "foo bar"]}' or something valid like that.
[15:31:59] <sadtaco> '{array:[foo,"bar", foo bar]}'
[15:32:31] <sadtaco> Goal is to make it into somethng that JSON.prase() will work on.
[15:33:10] <duch_kazatel> oh error handling...
[15:33:15] <duch_kazatel> why is the datasource wrong?
[15:34:11] <sadtaco> Because you don't know what a user could put in there.  As long as it has the correct ending ], }, then I think it should parse.
[15:34:22] <duch_kazatel> oh...
[15:34:40] <sadtaco> A one line of code to fix it up so it parses is better than 100+ lines of interface code to handhol them into writing it correctly and checking that it's written correctly.
[15:34:43] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to sanitize user input json
[15:34:47] <sadtaco> Yep
[15:34:56] <duch_kazatel> good luck :)
[15:35:32] <sadtaco> Well what I need doesn't seem like much. Yeah it's missing making sure there's ending ] and }, and ending quotes before commas, ], and }. But that's good enough.
[15:35:51] <sadtaco> But I'm not great at regex.
[15:36:09] <duch_kazatel> you're going to try to heuristically parse something to see what they intended - that's going to me more than a few lines.
[15:36:29] <duch_kazatel> that's why you just have a handler that says "invalid - try again".  but i'm sure you're sick of hearing that at this point.
[15:37:36] <sadtaco> Indeed.
[15:38:17] <sadtaco> if it's REALLY invalid and fails to parse, then I'll alert them that they're missing end quotes, end braces, end brackets.  But just ''{array:[foo,"bar", foo bar]}' I don't think is a huge deal to fix for them.
[15:38:30] <sadtaco> er minus that '' at the start. just '
[15:39:05] <duch_kazatel> i disagree with you.
[15:39:33] <duch_kazatel> if you're going to trust your users to input JSON, then they need to fulfill their end of that contract.
[15:39:43] <sadtaco> They're dumb.
[15:39:57] <duch_kazatel> sure = but if that's what they're getting, they need to fulfill on that contract.
[15:40:13] <duch_kazatel> reminds me of my last company.
[15:40:42] <sadtaco> But it's not coworkers inputting it
[15:40:48] <sadtaco> It's your little brother.
[15:40:49] <duch_kazatel> same with my last company.
[15:41:23] <sadtaco> To make some WYSIWYG editing that points out all their mistakes and makes sure they input something valid is even more complicated.
[15:41:37] <sadtaco> Well maybe not COMPLICATED
[15:41:40] <sadtaco> But more time consuming.
[15:41:40] <duch_kazatel> i'd just tell them it's invalid and to fix it
[15:41:50] <sadtaco> That's how I have it now and I don't like that much.
[15:42:28] <duch_kazatel> we had a client that wanted to send "XML", but it had a bunch of invalid tags all over the place.  we told them "we can't use this it's invalid" and they shot back with "the last vendor did it so it shouldn't be a problem".  our major decision majers made us get it to work.  we set up this ultra convoluted parser that did all this massaging and had custom delimiters and shit.
[15:42:36] <duch_kazatel> it'd break all the time when they added/removed something.  it was bad.
[15:42:58] <duch_kazatel> *majers = makers
[15:42:59] <sadtaco> Heh well sure I agree with you there.
[15:43:16] <duch_kazatel> we'd get questions all the time about "
[15:43:17] <duch_kazatel> "
[15:43:25] <duch_kazatel> wtf - "why can't you just make this work right all the time?"
[15:44:14] <sadtaco> But this is a main stream app thing.  If I were using it, frankly I'd expect something "human readable" like "{array:[foo, bar]}" to parse as {"array":["foo", "bar"]} especially when in javascript {foo:"bar"} is valid but in JSON it's not.
[15:44:16] <duch_kazatel> my response was always the same - "our stuff isn't smart enough to understand what you intended.  if we set them up that way, you'd be screaming at us that we didn't take you literally."
[15:45:01] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't expect it because I know JSON doesn't allow that.
[15:45:15] <duch_kazatel> in fact i'd be mad if it just trucked along like nothing was wrong.
[15:47:02] <xp_prg> I want to add an attribute to my html link to keep track of state

[15:51:55] <xp_prg> ok lets say I have <a href='' class='myclass' data-myattr='thing'>stuff</a>
[15:52:24] <xp_prg> is that how you put it in the link so you can then do $(".myclass").data('myattr);

[16:07:12] * frank_o would pop champagne if he had some
[16:07:32] <duch_kazatel> D:
[16:10:47] <blindMoe> anyone know of a plugin off the top of their head that will truncate text w/ a more button to expand the rest when clicked?
[16:12:10] <duch_kazatel> blindMoe use text-overflow: ellipsis; and remove that styling on click of "more"
[16:12:30] <blindMoe> duch_kazatel: is it compatible with ie8?
[16:12:46] <duch_kazatel> http://caniuse.com/text-overflow
[16:12:48] <frank_o> won't text-overflow: ellipsis also cut off the "more"?
[16:12:57] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to add that part in yourself.
[16:13:02] <frank_o> unless you put it outside the text in question
[16:13:03] <blindMoe> duch_kazatel: was looking at that but I though ellipses wasn't supported yet
[16:13:35] <duch_kazatel> "Append ellipsis when text overflows its containing element"
[16:13:44] <duch_kazatel> back to IE 6.0.
[16:13:46] <duch_kazatel> should work.
[16:14:01] <duch_kazatel> if not, i don't know of anything but it should be fairly trivial to write.
[16:15:02] <frank_o> blindMoe: i use an ellipsis plug i found off github, but the "more" part i had to do on my own with jquery
[16:15:18] <blindMoe> frank_o: happen to know the name?
[16:15:33] <blindMoe> I can add the more part fairly easily if it isn't removing the extra text from the dom
[16:15:38] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/micjamking/Succinct
[16:15:41] <duch_kazatel> here's one.
[16:15:47] <duch_kazatel> kind of old though.
[16:16:15] <colada> Okay, so I'm having a really strange problem with and not sure what's going on. The $(data) that I get back from an ajax call shows that the div with the id="main_holder_all" exists when I print it to console. When I call that div though, it says it's undefined. No matter what I do, I can't call that div with that id but I can call all child elements and the ajax works properly in jsfiddle. Any ideas here why this is?
[16:16:38] <blindMoe> seems like it would be such a common task that there would be a thousand jquery plugins for it
[16:16:48] <frank_o> blindMoe: http://bebraw.github.io/jquery.ellipsis/ .. so basically i hid all p's except the first... then applied ellipsis to the first
[16:17:07] <frank_o> blindMoe: then on more, i unellipsified it and unhid the p's.. works pretty well
[16:17:23] <blindMoe> frank_o: nice.. seems pretty straight forward.  Thanks
[16:17:33] <frank_o> ive tried all the ellipsis plugs on gh, imho the bebraw one is the best
[16:17:37] <duch_kazatel> colada can you share your code and data with us?
[16:17:45] <frank_o> cool
[16:19:24] <xp_prg> hi all I am trying to add a separate link to a link, I try something like this: $('#linkid').append("<a href=''>here</a>");  this puts the here link inside the other link not outside as a separate link
[16:19:51] <xp_prg> what have I done wrong besides go to school for 16 years for three degrees that I could have taken a couple of certification exams to gain?
[16:20:08] <duch_kazatel> xp_prg you what now?  you mean you want to add a link after the target?
[16:20:28] <xp_prg> I want add a new html link after another link that is clicked on
[16:20:37] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/after/
[16:20:41] <xp_prg> the click adds the new link right next to the link it was clicked on
[16:20:51] <duch_kazatel> right - you want .after(), not .append()
[16:21:24] <xp_prg> I heart you in a neo-conservative semi-platonic fiscally conservative way
[16:21:31] <duch_kazatel> welp
[16:21:36] <duch_kazatel> that's #2.
[16:22:07] <xp_prg> what about the 16 years of school that could have been substituted with a couple of cert exams over a weekend cram session reading some online books?
[16:22:15] <duch_kazatel> the hearting.
[16:22:24] <duch_kazatel> but what was that 16 years comment abouit
[16:22:39] <xp_prg> I have three degrees that were obselete before I graduated
[16:22:58] <xp_prg> it was a horrific gigantic waste of my precious time and money
[16:23:08] <xp_prg> I wanted to know if you had advice about that?
[16:23:17] <xp_prg> can I do .after on that too? :>

[16:29:31] <duch_kazatel> can you share your HTML, guzzlefry?
[16:29:50] <guzzlefry> not really :/
[16:30:02] <guzzlefry> I figure the debugging output would be adequate.
[16:30:15] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[16:30:53] <duch_kazatel> unless the first child of .ui-dialog-content isn't a button.
[16:31:04] <guzzlefry> oh
[16:31:06] <duch_kazatel> iirc.
[16:31:10] <guzzlefry> no,i t's a <p>
[16:31:32] <guzzlefry> I figured .button:first-child would be the first .button of the element
[16:32:19] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/c5xsA/
[16:32:20] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:32:25] <guzzlefry> ah ha!

[16:33:28] <circ-user-TjOwB> hey
[16:33:28] <duch_kazatel> you're using jquery.
[16:34:01] <guzzlefry> ...
[16:34:06] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/first/
[16:34:16] <colada> duch_kazatel okay, sorry took a while to cut out all the unnecessary code so you can read it more easily http://dpaste.com/0B468GT/
[16:34:44] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry http://jsfiddle.net/c5xsA/1/
[16:34:51] <guzzlefry> oh derp, I was just using jquery to test things. I'm actually applying styles via CSS. Been at  this for 13 hours, starting to show. ;)
[16:35:46] <colada> I'm really confused because ajax works everywhere else on the site- every other element I call works, and it's just THAT one element. I've even tried renaming it and searched my entire project to see if the class is called elsewhere
[16:37:05] <duch_kazatel> colada something seems off - you don't have a root node on that fragment...
[16:37:09] <duch_kazatel> you might want to add one.
[16:39:33] <colada> duch_kazatel root node..as in the <html></html> in the document?
[16:39:41] <duch_kazatel> colada as in one node around everything else.
[16:40:03] <duch_kazatel> not sure how jquery handles creating the fragment without having a single root node.
[16:40:21] <duch_kazatel> oooh nvm i see it now.
[16:41:11] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[16:41:23] <colada> sure, thanks
[16:41:45] <duch_kazatel> why do you have a button inside of an anchor?
[16:42:07] <colada> I was just trying stuff to see if I could make it work
[16:42:16] <colada> I even hardcoded the URL into the Ajax
[16:42:36] <colada> but it wasn't a problem with the ajax call so I just moved on
[16:45:09] <duch_kazatel> and you aren't getting any console errors?
[16:45:18] <colada> nothing at all...
[16:46:31] <colada> it's just weird how it shows up as undefined when I call it but it shows up in the $(data)
[16:47:17] <duch_kazatel> ooooh.
[16:47:26] <duch_kazatel> i get it :)
[16:47:46] <duch_kazatel> your .find() can't work because .main_holder_all is the parent - you can't find a parent from the parent.
[16:47:47] <duch_kazatel> make sense?
[16:48:55] <duch_kazatel> colada that make sense?
[16:49:21] <colada> duch_kazatel omg, i think you're right- I'm going to test it now.
[16:50:06] <duch_kazatel> you'
[16:50:11] <duch_kazatel> *you're basically running var theDiv = $('#testDiv'); theDiv.find('#testDiv');
[16:50:15] <heihei> I'm trying to use dropzone for uploading images: https://dpaste.de/1Jj6 what I would like to do is set autoProcessQueue to true when a button is clicked. Cannot figure out the syntax!
[16:51:27] <duch_kazatel> colada or, more accurately, you're doing this: var theDiv = $('<div id="testDiv"><p>findme</p></div>'); theDiv.find('#testDiv');
[16:54:07] <heihei> Can anyone wade through those 3 lines of code and help me out? :D
[16:54:43] <duch_kazatel> heihei link to the docs?
[16:55:04] <duch_kazatel> alternatively, console.log(dropIt) and figure out where that prop is set.
[16:55:22] <heihei> hmm, will try that
[16:57:48] <colada> duch_kazatel you're right! Makes total sense. Got it working by adding another div around everything. Thanks so much!
[16:58:04] <duch_kazatel> colada you could have just dropped the .find() refs.
[16:58:22] <heihei> it has an "options" object, which contains autoProcessQueue: false
[16:58:30] <duch_kazatel> heihei there you go.
[17:00:32] <colada> duch_kazatel how would I find the elment within the $(data), or do you mean using $(data) as a whole since the div element was the parent element anyways
[17:00:46] <duch_kazatel> colada just use $(data) because that IS the element you wanted.
[17:01:24] <heihei> well...dropIt.options.autoProcessQueue = true; set the correct value based on the console.log, but it didn't actually make the queue process. hmmm
[17:01:39] <duch_kazatel> heihei can you fiddle up what you're doing?
[17:01:46] <duch_kazatel> and link to the docs?
[17:03:45] <heihei> derp derp...dropIt.options.autoProcessQueue = true; dropIt.processQueue();
[17:03:53] <heihei> thank you, duch

[17:46:00] <_cb> jquery mobile <div data-role='content' id ='id_homediv'>".sf_eventsnotrepliedtoo($i_userid).. looks different than $("#id_homediv").html(s_html) where s_html is identical too sf_eventsnotrepliedtoo($i_userid), why?
[18:14:18] <antlong> anyone interested in game dev? have an open source project going, with about 15 people. looking for some help.
[18:20:02] <jphase> in jQuery?
[18:21:42] <_cb> Yes. if I do <div id= id_test>html it looks different than if I do $("#id_test").html(shtml)
[18:23:00] <jphase> <div id="id_test">content</div>    is the same as   $('#id_test').text('content');
[18:23:42] <_cb> Text will be the same. My problem is with the css formatting.
[18:25:35] <jphase> well css problems are another thing entirely, and we wouldn't be able to help even if it *was* on topic without using dev tools
[18:25:42] <_cb> I have a php function that generates html code. If I call that function when generating the page the div content looks one way. If I insert the exact same html via html( it looks different
[18:26:30] <jphase> well it's clearly not the exact same in that situation
[18:26:45] <jphase> php is server-side and thus if it generates the same html output it will look the same
[18:26:47] <jphase> something is different
[18:27:20] <_cb> I think jquery applies the css when loading the page but don't think the css is applied on inserted elements
[18:27:52] <jphase> css is not loaded by events, if you insert dynamic elements onto the page it will apply to those elements as well
[18:27:54] <_cb> Well, not jquery. The browser
[18:27:58] <jphase> so long as it matches your css
[18:29:28] <jphase> if you have....   .blah { border: 1px solid red; }   and use AJAX to pull content from PHP and insert the elements into the DOM like, <div class="blah">asdf</div> then it will have the red border applied
[18:32:35] <_cb> in one case I have <div data-role='content ><div id ='id_homediv>".sf_eventsnotrepliedtoox($i_userid) and in another $("#id_homediv").html(s_html) where s_html is the output of sf_eventsnotrepliedtoox($i_userid)
[18:33:18] <jphase> is there a reason why every example you give is invalid html? like all the attributes aren't closing and have funny spaces in the elements
[18:33:41] <jphase> if you're going to give an example, hastebin.com your entire example
[18:39:19] <_cb> Sorry was separating homediv to test.
[18:54:13] <_cb> Ok here is an example: http://hastebin.com/joyonajeqa.xml
[18:59:04] <BillCriswell> Do people really put spaces before and after the equal sign in HTML attributes?
[19:00:21] <antlong> probably carried over from other languages
[19:02:13] <_cb> yes also <> instead of != and ; at the end the braces and so on
[19:03:37] <BillCriswell> _cb: http://jsbin.com/zedupuce/1/edit?html,js,output might be what you were going for?
[19:04:43] <BillCriswell> _cb: You shouldn't have any href="javascript:whatever" or onClick="whatever" in your HTML.
[19:07:14] <_cb> Actually was hoping to keep the jquery css formatting.
[19:09:40] <BillCriswell> I just tried breaking it down to plain HTML and JS. The CSS wouldn't matter.
[19:13:15] <_cb> I think that if you add <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0/jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.css" /> you will see it changes
[19:16:23] <BillCriswell> _cb: Right, that won't effect what the JS is doing.
[19:17:23] <_cb> how does one insert html without changing the look of the inserted element ?
[19:20:29] <BillCriswell> _cb: The classes and ids would need to match up. You can't just add some HTML and expect the CSS to know how to style it.
[19:20:43] <_cb> BillCriswell using your much more elegant code. (unfortunatelly same result ;() http://hastebin.com/wapowotuci.xml
[19:24:59] <BillCriswell> _cb: I'm not sure what you mean by same result.
[19:26:33] <_cb> BillCriswell, when the page loads the button has one look, after clickin on the test link it has another look although the html inserted by vftest is identical.
[19:33:10] <BillCriswell> _cb: I guess jQuery mobile runs some JS on data-role="button" elements.
[19:33:48] <_cb> Yeah, jquery mobile has really cool looking elements for mobile.
[19:34:40] <_cb> BillCriswell that ugly looking button looks pretty good on a smartphone.
[19:38:08] <BillCriswell> _cb: You could do like var $button = $("<a data-role='button' href = '#'>ButtonT</a>").button(); $('#id_test').html($button); maybe?
[19:41:34] <_cb> BillCriswell I am thinking the page is formatted when first rendered but not when html is inserted. Am googling to see if there is something like a refresh
[19:41:54] <BillCriswell> _cb: Yeah, that's what I tried doing with the .button() call.
[19:50:30] <_cb> BillCriswell adding  $("#id_test").("refresh"); does the trick ;)
[19:50:52] <BillCriswell> That doesn't seem right... but if it works, awesome!
[19:51:46] <sammych> there's no function name, but sure
[19:52:18] <sammych> in Chrome console/network, how can I see the size of the request being sent?
[19:52:45] <sammych> I can see the response size, but now how much outbound there is
[19:53:05] <sammych> oh, no I see it
[19:54:07] <BillCriswell> sammych: Sweeeeet.
[19:54:08] <sammych> i can see it from the detail of the request but you can't add it as a column in the summary table
[19:54:30] <sammych> it gives you another content-length value
[19:59:24] <BillCriswell> https://github.com/django/django/pull/2692 this blows my mind.
[20:02:07] <sammych> wow
[20:02:21] <sammych> in this case, PC takes on another meaning
[20:04:11] <BillCriswell> The word "Save" offends me being an atheist and all.
[20:06:52] <BillCriswell> I'd like to call it "Bring up to date"
[20:08:06] <BillCriswell> I wonder how often the people actually being offended by something should be the ones being offended.
[20:15:15] <Vivekananda> hi everyone need a little git help
[20:15:31] <Vivekananda> if anyone around would care to share his knowledge
[20:23:46] <jphase> Vivekananda: what's your issue exactly?
[20:31:59] <Vivekananda> jphase: i try git diff file or git diff and I get no output. earlier I used to see the 'file' with all adds and substracts and diff betweent the staged adn the head. I guess I messed up git diff and just want to get back to the default
[20:40:47] <jphase> Vivekananda: are there any changes on your local repo?
[20:41:24] <Vivekananda> jphase: figured it out : git config --global --unset diff.external
[20:42:17] <Vivekananda> jphase: but the thing is that earlier git diff file used to gimme the changes between the cached and the head
[20:42:39] <Vivekananda> now it doesnt but git diff --cached  fileName  does it
[20:42:41] <Vivekananda> wonder why
[21:22:30] <buzzybron> i am getting :input using a selector, and cycling through the the elements using $(this) to print out the text, how can i do it for drop down lists?, printing out the text shows me the entire list of text
[21:24:25] <jphase> buzzybron: why not just use $(this).val() instead of $(this).text() ?
[23:04:05] <diverdude> Hello, I am looking for functionality similar to this: http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos/simple.html - draggable windows. The linked example seem to do the job...I am just wondering if this is the latest and greatest or if there are other layout managers like this which are newer, better, faster, stronger, less bloated etc?
[23:12:55] <jay> Could somebody help me get my clickable to work, It will only work when I do a document.ready(function)  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6508846d72e12b639602
[23:26:21] <sammych> what's the best WYSIWYG editor out there?
[23:26:35] <sammych> TinyMCE>
[23:26:42] <diverdude> sammych: CKEditor
[23:27:19] <sammych> that's the other one I was trying to remember
[23:27:35] <diverdude> is there a more up to date library which can do this: http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos/simple.html ?
[23:27:36] <flanders> How do I load an API?
[23:29:00] <sacho> You can't load an API.
[23:29:07] <sacho> What are you trying to do?
[23:30:44] <JJJAJSON> hi web gurus, can anyone please help me on how to do a container border (left and right only), that fades? similar to: https://support.google.com/nexus/?hl=en#topic=3415518
[23:30:48] <sammych> okay, how about a WYSIWYG editor that has page layout?
[23:31:27] <sammych> JJJAJSON: box-shadow, you'll have to hide the top and bottom
[23:32:15] <JJJAJSON> hi sammych, i tried to do that but it seems to always do one side only, or the 2 adjacent sides like a 'shadow'
[23:32:50] <sammych> one side only? did you set the style right?
[23:35:23] <JJJAJSON> ive done this but i cant set it to both sides http://jsfiddle.net/SR7d9/
[23:35:32] <JJJAJSON> sorry im a total noob at web dev im learning it in school
[23:37:52] <sammych> okay, I figured as much
[23:37:59] <sammych> as in, not the noob part ;)
[23:38:06] <sammych> the offset of the shadow
[23:38:37] <sammych> leave the first two x-y offset as 0, that will leave you with a full shadow all the way around
[23:38:45] <sammych> then you'll have to hide the top and bottom of the box
[23:38:46] <JJJAJSON> im not sure what they are but i messed with the numbers and got the right side looking ok : http://jsfiddle.net/SR7d9/
[23:39:30] <JJJAJSON> so do a full shadow everywhere, and then hide the top and bottom? so do i do border-top : 0 !important to hide?
[23:40:55] <JJJAJSON> http://jsfiddle.net/SR7d9/1/ it should be this one <<
[23:49:40] <sammych> by hide, I mean you have to obscure it
[23:49:55] <sammych> in the google product page, it's hidden because it's bounded by the window
[23:50:10] <sammych> you might do the same, or put extra divs above and below
[23:50:20] <diverdude> is it difficult to build this sort of interface with jquery? http://layout.jquery-dev.net/demos/simple.html
[23:54:08] <JJJAJSON> i see, ill see if i can add divs around it and see how that works, thanks sammy
