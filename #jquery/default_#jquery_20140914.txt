[01:31:11] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[02:29:33] <hene-_> hi! I have been trying to solve this thing: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25831360/disable-accordion-depending-on-window-size
[02:29:46] <hene-_> just could not find right way to do it
[02:32:15] <hene-_> tryed to add class for accordion trigger when screen size is 500px or lower, but accordion is not working with that class
[02:32:21] <hene-_> class was added inside h3-tag
[02:39:46] <krambiorix> hi, can someone help me? http://jsfiddle.net/vk01bogg/1/   -> when filling in for example '20,8558'   the resulting number should be 20,86 and not 20,8.558
[02:40:03] <sacho> please don't use alerts.
[02:41:35] <sacho> What are you trying to do there?
[02:43:27] <krambiorix> sacho   check if the number is valid and transform it to a number with thousand separator '.'  and decimal separator ','  and 2 digits after the comma
[02:45:05] <Woet> krambiorix: why not just use a function that does it for you? http://phpjs.org/functions/number_format/
[02:46:09] <sacho> or http://numeraljs.com/ , etc
[02:48:15] <hene-_> sacho, any thoughts/ideas on my problem? :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25831360/disable-accordion-depending-on-window-size
[02:48:24] <krambiorix> sacho, i tried with numeraljs but numeral(v).format('0,0.00'); ---> 50 000,00   -> the dot doesn't appear
[02:51:05] <sacho> jsfiddle just died, I think :|
[02:52:17] <hene-_> for me it works
[02:54:25] <krambiorix> sacho,  for me too
[03:01:53] <hene-_> hmh, cant believe that accordion disable solution is too hard
[03:02:09] <hene-_> must be something pretty simple, but I cant just figure it out
[03:02:28] <jop008> is this equivalent var cid, oel = null;  var cid =null, oel=null;?
[03:26:18] <sacho> jop008, no
[03:47:14] <krambiorix> sacho,  any idea on how to use numeraljs ?
[03:56:13] <hene-_> any help to disabling accordion clickable? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25831360/disable-accordion-depending-on-window-size
[05:02:41] <krambiorix> is there a genereric event like on opening all dialog ?
[05:03:06] <hene-_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25831360/disable-accordion-depending-on-window-size
[05:03:37] <hene-_> I tryed to remove class if window size > 500, but still accrdion trigger is working
[05:03:42] <hene-_> even though I removed that class
[05:03:56] <hene-_> h3 class
[05:04:07] <hene-_> strange? how on earth that should be solved
[05:36:06] <Snoopal> if i use var hxr = $.ajax({...}); when i dump hxr I see that it is a object. and one property is "responseText". how can i access responseText? hxr.responseText does not work.. any hint appreciated!
[05:57:46] <brettfrable> this is extremely off topic
[05:58:18] <brettfrable> but is anyone here good with mac problems? I have a 2011 21.5 inch iMac and ever since upgrading to mavericks last year, it has been increasingly slow.
[05:59:18] <brettfrable> I'm running first aid and its currently checking disk permissions which seems to show TONS of issues
[06:13:26] <compact> hi. i have a jquery script, that includes a php file when an option is selected. i have it working fine, however if i submit a form, it redirects to the PHP url, instead of staying on the same page. any idea how i can fix this? thanks
[07:31:47] <compact> hi. i have jQuery('#outputs').parent().html('<img src="image.php'+result+'" alt="Barcode Image" />');
[07:31:53] <compact> however, it keeps overwriting the whole block
[07:31:56] <compact> instead of the div
[07:32:01] <compact> #outputs
[07:32:02] <compact> any idea
[07:34:38] <Zitter> what's "net::ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES" and how to solve that?
[07:35:48] <Zitter> I'm loading JSON data from graph.facebook.com
[07:37:46] <Alina-malina> ok i have 2 tables near each other, and i want to find the differences between em and highlight them how to do so?
[07:53:25] <compact> hello?
[08:40:15] <robertmaxrees> compact you're getting the parent of #outputs and setting its htmk to that image.
[08:40:23] <robertmaxrees> *html
[08:41:39] <compact> fixed that. now just having issue, once I've loaded a PHP file, by using on change. no css or javascript is used on the php file
[08:42:43] <robertmaxrees> compact you can't load php - you're loading the html that gets generated.
[08:43:18] <robertmaxrees> the css should work just fine unless it's getting put into an iframe or you're targeting things through a parent container the new content doesn't have
[08:43:42] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina you can get the .height() of each.
[08:44:25] <Alina-malina> robertmaxrees, hmmmm can i highlight with .height the different tables?
[08:44:41] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina what do you mean by "highlight"?
[08:44:52] <Alina-malina> there are 2 tables on page
[08:44:54] <Alina-malina> i call them with ajax
[08:44:58] <robertmaxrees> i read that part.
[08:45:00] <Alina-malina> so if there is difference between those tables
[08:45:15] <Alina-malina> i need to highlight the differece values
[08:45:25] <robertmaxrees> still not following.
[08:45:29] <Alina-malina> make it color of red
[08:45:40] <robertmaxrees> you want to highlight an entire table?
[08:46:04] <Alina-malina> no just the rows that match
[08:46:15] <robertmaxrees> still not following.
[08:46:16] <Alina-malina> i have 2 tables with rows inside tablename, tablecount
[08:46:18] <Alina-malina> erm
[08:46:21] <Alina-malina> let me make a screenshot
[08:46:23] <Alina-malina> just a moment please
[08:46:35] <robertmaxrees> share your code in a fiddle instead :)
[08:47:45] <Alina-malina> no
[08:47:50] <Alina-malina> i cant use fiddle
[08:47:55] <Alina-malina> robertmaxrees, http://i.imgur.com/fqODogf.jpg
[08:48:03] <robertmaxrees> erm, a fixee would be good.  same with jsbin...
[08:48:27] <robertmaxrees> so you can't make a simplified example of this?
[08:52:14] <Alina-malina> i only have 2 tables
[08:52:16] <Alina-malina> no code
[08:52:18] <Alina-malina> i dont know how to do that
[08:52:20] <Alina-malina> mr robert
[08:52:25] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0fm5t9gg/\
[08:52:40] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle with two tables.  easy stuff >.>
[08:52:58] <robertmaxrees> either way, what does that screenshot have to do with the height of the tables?
[08:53:16] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to find values that are the same in each table and highlight the?
[08:53:18] <robertmaxrees> *them
[08:54:05] <Alina-malina> i am trying to find the values that are NOT the same and higlight em
[08:54:33] <Alina-malina> ok i am inside dat fiddle
[08:55:37] <robertmaxrees> okay - so in this updated example: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0fm5t9gg/1/
[08:55:54] <robertmaxrees> you'd want the values for "name 2" and "name 3" to be highlighted, correct?
[08:56:33] <Alina-malina> erm
[08:56:58] <Alina-malina> there are 2 rows in each table
[08:57:12] <Alina-malina> the first one name1 and name2 they are not changing only the values are  changable
[08:57:14] <robertmaxrees> look at the link I just shared.
[08:57:19] <Alina-malina> i did
[08:57:22] <Alina-malina> it doesnt make any sense
[08:57:26] <robertmaxrees> okay, then please setup your own fiddle.
[08:57:33] <Alina-malina> just a moment
[08:57:34] <robertmaxrees> because i have no idea what you want and don't really want to play guessing games :)
[08:58:16] <Alina-malina> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/0fm5t9gg/2/   the name3 need to be highlighted
[08:58:33] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[08:58:40] <Alina-malina> name 1 pass, name2 pass aha name3  doesnt match name3 highlight dat nigga!
[08:58:53] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[08:59:01] <robertmaxrees> please avoid using that kind of language :)
[08:59:11] <Alina-malina> hmmm
[08:59:47] <Alina-malina> ok name1 pass, name2 pass aha name3 doesnt match lets put a smile on dat face
[09:00:28] <robertmaxrees> okay.  the easiest way would be to slap a class on each tr for the group, then run through those classes and run the comparison that way.
[09:00:55] <Alina-malina> hmmm
[09:01:49] <davlefou> hi, how put this in sub function? $('.PasswdSelect').focusout(verifiePasse(?));
[09:02:10] <robertmaxrees> davlefou not following.  "sub function"?
[09:02:25] <Alina-malina> robertmaxrees, i still not following what did you say
[09:02:37] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina what part didn't you follow?
[09:02:45] <Alina-malina> the whole part
[09:02:52] <davlefou> ? is that i look for to put for call function verifiePasse(element) {}
[09:03:10] <robertmaxrees> davlefou that's called a "callback"
[09:03:16] <Alina-malina> davearel, why verifiePasse and not verifiePassu?
[09:03:30] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0fm5t9gg/3/
[09:03:47] <robertmaxrees> grab the classes and do you comparisons like this.
[09:04:19] <davlefou> robertmaxrees, euh, the callback is on event, but i would like to have function for test serverals case.
[09:04:43] <robertmaxrees> then define the function and pass around the name...
[09:04:52] <robertmaxrees> can you setup a fiddle to illustrate where you're getting stuck?
[09:05:01] <Alina-malina> hmmm i think i tried this, ok let me try one more time thanks for help
[09:06:00] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina line 7 in the JS panel gets you that collection.  dump through that collection and compare the values.
[09:07:40] <Alina-malina> yes i will compare each value and do the stuff
[09:08:29] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina in the future, setting up a fiddle is the preferred way to get help in cases like yours ;)
[09:10:03] <Alina-malina> fiddle laggs
[09:10:09] <Alina-malina> when i open it i cant even move my mouse
[09:10:18] <robertmaxrees> then you have a problem with your computer.
[09:10:20] <robertmaxrees> what about jsbin?
[09:10:30] <robertmaxrees> even using something like fixee.org is helpful.
[09:10:54] <Alina-malina> pastebin?
[09:11:08] <robertmaxrees> fixee is like pastebin but much better
[09:11:17] <robertmaxrees> the ads and stuff on pastebin are annoying.
[09:11:59] <litropy> With an ajax request, may I only specify a directory if I have index.php in that directory, or must I url: path + 'index.php' ?
[09:12:11] <Alina-malina> oh shit i have to give classname to each tr too?
[09:12:20] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina that's going to be your best bet, yes
[09:12:28] <Alina-malina> hmm ok
[09:12:33] <Alina-malina> i can add the index
[09:12:41] <Alina-malina> index+1
[09:12:45] <robertmaxrees> litropy the url is relative.
[09:12:54] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina hrm?
[09:13:01] <Alina-malina> name1 names2......
[09:13:03] <Alina-malina> those things
[09:13:13] <robertmaxrees> why are you adding the index+1 to anything?
[09:13:40] <Alina-malina> erm
[09:13:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd use a more descriptive name for each row personally.
[09:13:42] <Alina-malina> to not get 0
[09:13:52] <Alina-malina> :-/
[09:13:58] <Alina-malina> ok let me try something
[09:14:07] <litropy> robertmaxrees, I know. But will it do what a browser does and look for index.php?
[09:14:19] <litropy> Without me specifying it
[09:14:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:14:29] <robertmaxrees> that part is up to your server.
[09:14:42] <litropy> robertmaxrees, thx
[09:14:52] <robertmaxrees> if you don't specify a file for a directory, it's your server's job to determine what to respond with.
[09:14:59] <robertmaxrees> the browser doesn't care :)
[09:15:08] <robertmaxrees> i
[09:15:32] <Alina-malina> robertmaxrees, ok it gives name0 name1 name2 etc
[09:15:39] <Alina-malina> is it ok?
[09:15:44] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina totally your call.
[09:15:56] <robertmaxrees> litropy i'd be explicit in that $.ajax() call though and specify the file just so things don't magically break later on when you change your url structures around.
[09:16:08] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina i'd still give those rows more meaningful names, but whatever floats your boat.
[09:16:23] <Alina-malina> for classes? its ok
[09:16:53] <robertmaxrees> yes for classes.  for everything.  variables, IDs, data-* attribute names and values...
[09:17:14] <litropy> robertmaxrees, yah I'm alread having trouble with pushState/popState with that. It's quite frustrating.
[09:17:40] <robertmaxrees> litropy aaaah, yeah the history api is... interesting.  I did a lot of work with it a while ago.
[09:18:16] <litropy> robertmaxrees, like ... for some reason I have to delve two links deep for popstate event to not be null.
[09:18:28] <robertmaxrees> litropy huh?
[09:18:35] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're binding things incorrectly.
[09:19:39] <litropy> robertmaxrees, when I pushState, you mean?
[09:19:58] <robertmaxrees> litropy i'd have to see your code to know.
[09:20:19] <litropy> robertmaxrees, give me a few mins to mess around with it.
[09:22:46] <Alina-malina> robertmaxrees, Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: . :-/
[09:22:55] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina share your code if you need help.
[09:24:45] <Alina-malina> robertmaxrees, eh i am not good with this stuff http://jsfiddle.net/0fm5t9gg/4/
[09:25:04] <robertmaxrees> woah
[09:25:14] <robertmaxrees> why are you duplicating code like this?
[09:25:46] <Alina-malina> just 2 functions
[09:25:50] <robertmaxrees> also, you can't have spaces around the = for attributes.  needs to be class="button"
[09:25:51] <Alina-malina> i dont need anything else there
[09:25:57] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina you're replicating the same code between then,,,'
[09:26:00] <robertmaxrees> *them
[09:26:02] <Alina-malina> hmmm
[09:26:08] <Alina-malina> no
[09:26:09] <Alina-malina> i am not
[09:26:16] <robertmaxrees> yep, you are.
[09:26:37] <Alina-malina> whatever
[09:26:54] <robertmaxrees> not whatever.  it's the same logic
[09:27:00] <Alina-malina> no
[09:27:01] <Alina-malina> it is not same
[09:27:04] <robertmaxrees> the only thing you're changing are the elements you're targeting.
[09:27:07] <Alina-malina> yes
[09:27:11] <Alina-malina> leave that
[09:27:12] <Alina-malina> it works ok
[09:27:17] <Alina-malina> the problem is with your code
[09:27:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:27:26] <robertmaxrees> whatever dude.
[09:27:52] <Alina-malina> i know what you are talking about the repllicating stuff, i just need to highlight the stuff thats it
[09:28:07] <robertmaxrees> i gave you a functioning example and you changed the markup to something totally different.
[09:28:10] <Alina-malina> when i hit the button: rror: Syntax error, unrecognized expression:   it igves this error
[09:28:15] <Alina-malina> yes
[09:28:23] <Alina-malina> it wont work with name1, name2
[09:28:45] <Alina-malina> same error by the way
[09:28:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:29:07] <Alina-malina> this is a srs bznz
[09:29:11] <Alina-malina> and a non-lol zone
[09:29:13] <Alina-malina> >.<
[09:29:56] <robertmaxrees> also you only need one $(function() {});
[09:30:28] <Alina-malina> where?
[09:30:30] <Alina-malina> in your code/
[09:30:42] <robertmaxrees> your code
[09:30:46] <Alina-malina> no
[09:30:48] <Alina-malina> it works fine
[09:30:50] <Alina-malina> leave it
[09:30:53] <Alina-malina> i told you
[09:31:08] <robertmaxrees> mind if I PM you?
[09:31:23] <Alina-malina> you are welcome
[09:40:34] <Uhkis> lol
[09:42:28] <Alina-malina> yes
[09:42:31] <robertmaxrees> totally amazes me when people are so unwilling to do things for themselves or hear me out.
[09:43:04] <Alina-malina> dont try to help unless you 100% understand what are you talking about, and dont try to flirt with em when you trying to help
[09:43:10] <Alina-malina> it is distructin
[09:43:11] <robertmaxrees> excuse me?
[09:43:35] <Alina-malina> you are forgiven
[09:43:52] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to ask you to not talk to me like that.
[09:45:04] <Alina-malina> if you know something, just tell me straightly, you keep it slowly talking some stuff that you did not fully understand, if you cant help me just step back, instead you delaying pointleslly and spending my time, if you see the problem tell it straightly......
[09:45:20] <robertmaxrees> i did tell you, multiple times.
[09:45:24] <robertmaxrees> you refused to listen.
[09:45:24] <Alina-malina> no you did not
[09:45:26] <Alina-malina> wow
[09:45:27] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[09:45:56] <Alina-malina> you said that you ignore  parts of the code, how can you say that you tell me that you tell me the problem?
[09:45:57] <Alina-malina> heh
[09:46:06] <robertmaxrees> you told me to ignore those parts.
[09:46:23] <Alina-malina> in purpose of criticising it only
[09:46:27] <Uhkis> asking for free help, getting free help, whining about free help not being fast enough?
[09:46:28] <robertmaxrees> you were not clear.
[09:46:35] <Alina-malina> am i clear now?
[09:46:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:46:54] <robertmaxrees> talking to a mod like that isn't going to get you very far.
[09:47:00] <Tiraspol> fuck you robert
[09:47:05] <Tiraspol> ur gay
[09:47:14] <Alina-malina> the truth is only 1 and not multiple
[09:47:40] <Alina-malina> you cant find the problem then step back
[09:47:44] <Alina-malina> i dont get your point
[09:48:22] <Alina-malina> Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: .  so i still get this error even if i fix all the small things there
[09:49:02] <robertmaxrees> Alina-malina right - because you have a tr with no class.
[09:49:15] <Alina-malina> but i have :-/
[09:49:17] <Alina-malina> i showed you
[09:49:22] <robertmaxrees> not before that bit runs.
[09:49:24] <Alina-malina> here: "<tr class="+v.table_name +"><th>"+v.table_name + "</th><th>"+ v.TABLE_ROWS+"</th></tr>" );
[09:49:27] <Alina-malina> hmmm
[09:49:33] <robertmaxrees> that code doesn't run when the page loads.
[09:49:44] <Alina-malina> it runs
[09:49:52] <Alina-malina> it add the stuff itno table i can see that visually
[09:50:10] <robertmaxrees> but do you remove the original <tr>s that are there ahead of time?
[09:50:43] <Alina-malina> there is no <tr>s inside original <tbody>
[09:50:51] <Alina-malina> hmmm
[09:51:24] <Alina-malina> the tbody is just empty
[09:51:26] <robertmaxrees> the code that I gave you is looking at all <tr>s that are children of a table.
[09:51:43] <robertmaxrees> not just tbody.  you'd have to update to look at just the tbody if that's what you want.
[09:52:20] <Alina-malina> eh how to show you the full thing
[09:52:21] <Alina-malina> hmmm
[09:52:43] <robertmaxrees> look at the fiddle - it's running $tableOne.find('tr').each(function() {
[09:53:07] <Alina-malina> yes
[09:53:09] <Alina-malina> i see that
[09:53:13] <Alina-malina> i am watching at it right nwo
[09:53:23] <robertmaxrees> that finds all child <tr> elements of $tableOne.  there are <tr>s under the <thead>  it's catching those and blowing up when it's trying to select elements using $('.') as a selector.
[09:53:27] <robertmaxrees> that's why it's failing.
[09:53:36] <Alina-malina> yes i removed them
[09:53:40] <Alina-malina> but still same error
[09:54:03] <robertmaxrees> i don't see that error now in the fiddle when I remove those TRs.
[09:54:11] <Alina-malina> :-/
[09:54:35] <Alina-malina> maybe because  i gave the class names same names as values?
[09:54:44] <Alina-malina> inside trs?
[09:55:11] <robertmaxrees> the error that you were seeing earlier was literally because there was no class on a TR.
[09:55:11] <Alina-malina> the <tr>s classname is same as the child inside th
[09:55:19] <Alina-malina> there is class on TR now
[10:01:22] <neredsenvy> Is there a jQ image gallery plugin which can load images from a folder ?
[10:01:31] <neredsenvy> Without me having to name them all ?
[10:02:00] <robertmaxrees> neredsenvy jquery won't really have a way to retrieve the directory listing without you building it to do that.
[10:04:14] <ranjan_> is jquery framewrok any good?
[10:04:39] <robertmaxrees> ranjan_ jquery is more of a library, and you're asking in the official support channel for it - of course we'll tell you it's good :)
[10:05:03] <ranjan_> oh its a library then?
[10:05:24] <robertmaxrees> that's a better descriptor, yes.
[10:05:48] <ranjan_> robertmaxrees, well i need a framework i think
[10:05:58] <robertmaxrees> ranjan_ what are you're trying to build?
[10:06:08] <ranjan_> my boss tells me select a good javascript framework
[10:06:25] <ranjan_> to handle all our javascript
[10:06:36] <robertmaxrees> what will it be used for?
[10:06:38] <ranjan_> i was debating jquery v/s angular
[10:06:47] <ranjan_> for all things javascript
[10:06:51] <robertmaxrees> jquery and angular serve two different purposes.
[10:06:56] <robertmaxrees> in fact, you can use the two together.
[10:07:01] <robertmaxrees> or jquery and bootstrap.
[10:07:11] <ranjan_> no it would be too heavy
[10:07:13] <robertmaxrees> or jquery and backbone.
[10:07:26] <ranjan_> one framework for all our js needs
[10:07:27] <robertmaxrees> or jquery, backbone, bootstrap, and some other tools.  lots of choices.
[10:07:53] <ranjan_> no i already narrowed it down to jq v/s angular
[10:08:02] <robertmaxrees> that's nto a very good comparison.
[10:08:11] <robertmaxrees> they do 2 separate things.
[10:08:18] <robertmaxrees> lots of people use them together, in fact.
[10:08:26] <ranjan_> no they are both javascript libraries
[10:08:35] <robertmaxrees> angular is an MV*
[10:08:42] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a DOM abstraction library
[10:09:01] <ranjan_> well $.ajax can handle models
[10:09:09] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[10:09:13] <robertmaxrees> not the way angular does.
[10:09:15] <ranjan_> $.Deferred can be controller
[10:09:24] <robertmaxrees> that's not the way I'd use it, but sure.
[10:09:41] <ranjan_> and angular has jquery lite
[10:09:52] <ranjan_> so its jq v/s angular same thing
[10:09:55] <robertmaxrees> correct.  you can use angular with a full version of jquery.
[10:10:03] <robertmaxrees> you're comparing two completely different libraries.
[10:10:14] <ranjan_> no same thing javascript framework
[10:10:20] <robertmaxrees> not the same thing at all.
[10:10:37] <ranjan_> angular does MV so can jq
[10:10:51] <robertmaxrees> you want advice and then refuse to listen to anybody tell you anything.  good luck.
[10:10:56] <ranjan_> jquery has DOM abstraction and angular has built in jqlite
[10:11:11] <robertmaxrees> right, angular can also use full jquery instead of jqlite.
[10:11:30] <ranjan_> nooo too heavy
[10:11:32] <robertmaxrees> because angular needs the DOM abstraction that jquery/jqlite can give.
[10:11:39] <robertmaxrees> define "too heavy"
[10:12:05] <robertmaxrees> because if you use google CDN hosted versions, the user will already have them downloaded.
[10:12:19] <ranjan_> thats a myth
[10:12:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:12:27] <robertmaxrees> whatever duder.
[10:13:09] <ranjan_> http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/681196/The-Myth-of-the-CDN
[10:18:49] <robertBusy> *sigh* okay, semantics and pedanticism aside, i'd really strongly suggest not trying to use jquery as an MV*
[10:19:36] <ranjan_> huh! look at the todo app made with jq quite nicely seperated in concerns
[10:19:47] <ranjan_> by some guy called addy
[10:19:58] <ranjan_> he does use jquery like an mvc
[10:20:34] <robertBusy> i still wouldn't suggest using it that way, but feel free to if that's your thing.
[10:20:46] <ranjan_> and you dont seem to endorse you library / framework
[10:20:50] <robertBusy> i do.
[10:20:59] <robertBusy> 100%  jquery is a fantastic DOM abstraction library.
[10:21:18] <ranjan_> no then jquery needs to get rid of $ajax # deferred
[10:21:22] <ranjan_> $callback
[10:21:23] <robertBusy> wtf
[10:21:25] <ranjan_> $ effects
[10:21:31] <robertBusy> you're conflating concepts imo
[10:21:38] <ranjan_> then it will be pure dom abstraction
[10:21:46] <robertBusy> mmkay.
[10:22:11] <ranjan_> sizzle it too much for selctors
[10:22:16] <robertBusy> lol sure.
[10:22:24] <ranjan_> and shouldnt be part of dom abstraction
[10:22:47] <robertBusy> why would you ask a question like that and then proceed to argue with people over it?
[10:22:48] <ranjan_> well you called it a dom abrtaction lib
[10:22:55] <ranjan_> i called it a framework
[10:23:07] <robertBusy> the jquery website calls it a library.
[10:23:27] <robertBusy> you can use it to do MV* kinds of things, but I personally wouldn't suggest it.
[10:23:30] <ranjan_> what i said you guys dont seem to endorse you framework
[10:23:44] <robertBusy> <ranjan_> is jquery framewrok any good?
[10:23:58] <robertBusy> that's what you opened with.  dunno what to tell you at this point.
[10:24:07] <obert> do you get a gallery responsive script?
[10:24:26] <ranjan_> gallery is not responsive
[10:24:42] <obert> ?
[10:24:44] <robertBusy> huh?
[10:24:56] <robertBusy> i have to go for a bit.  enjoy folks.
[10:25:00] <ranjan_> my boss needs a selection between jq and angular
[10:25:16] <ranjan_> boss is always right!
[10:25:17] <obert> ranjan_: wut?
[10:25:45] <obert> is there a decent jquery gallery responsive script?
[10:25:47] <ranjan_> i am comparing jq with angular
[10:26:03] <ranjan_> i am new and not responsive
[10:26:48] <robertBusy> ranjan_ tell your boss that they serve two completely different purposes.
[10:27:01] <ranjan_> he wont listen
[10:27:04] <robertBusy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18414012/why-use-angularjs-instead-of-jquery
[10:27:07] <robertBusy> send him this.
[10:27:22] <ranjan_> he will say i am slacking off
[10:27:34] <robertBusy> then your boss doesn't trust you and isn't a very good boss.
[10:28:17] <robertBusy> he's asking for you to choose between a dom abstraction lib and an MV* - that's not ever going to go very well.  there's a reason angular includes a stripped down version of jquery.
[10:28:40] <ranjan_> whats the reason?
[10:29:10] <robertBusy> because it's in many ways easier to use the DOM abstraction and utilities of jquery than the native thing.
[10:29:19] <ranjan_> so all of angualr features can be replicated by existing plugins
[10:29:29] <ranjan_> templating plugin check
[10:29:36] <ranjan_> data binding plugin check
[10:29:39] <robertBusy> lol
[10:29:57] <robertBusy> i'd use something like riot.js for bindings, underscore for templating, and jquery for its thing.
[10:30:03] <robertBusy> or backbone.  i personally don't like angular.
[10:30:33] <ranjan_> underscore for templating no way!
[10:30:44] <ranjan_> templates should be logicless
[10:31:07] <ranjan_> _ is good for functional stuff sucks at templating
[10:31:07] <robertBusy> underscore has an entire templating system built into it.
[10:31:17] <robertBusy> i disagree, but okay.
[10:31:37] <ranjan_> it uses eval! for god sake
[10:31:49] <robertBusy> lol
[10:32:00] <robertBusy> i'm going to actually go now.  good luck.
[10:36:25] <gurke_> someone firm with masonry?
[10:37:24] <obert> i will continue to search by myself. thank you
[10:40:03] <Alina-malina> if i dont add <tr> how is that possible if when i open that page it is inside with console inspector when i check :-/  ??
[10:41:30] <gurke_> Alina-malina, you should add tr to your table
[10:41:37] <Alina-malina> yes i know
[10:41:41] <Alina-malina> ok
[10:43:10] <Alina-malina> to robertmax.... i just add some random class to tr and the script start to work
[10:43:11] <Alina-malina> hhe
[10:43:16] <Alina-malina> gurke_, thanks my friend
[10:43:23] <gurke_> np
[10:50:37] <gurke_> i need help with masonry
[11:04:32] <obert> hey gurke_
[11:05:42] <gurke_> hi obert
[11:10:14] <Sgeo_> I wrote some code along the lines of $("<somelement>").attachTo(someNativeIframe.contentWindow.document.body). Later, I learned that I could have done $("<someelement>", somenativeIframe.contentWindow.document.body);, if I understand properly. Is there a significant reason to prefer the latter in general? (If for some reason it would be difficult to change the code now)
[11:10:47] <Sgeo_> Oh, maybe just $("<someeleent>", somenativeIframe.contentWindow.document)
[11:11:11] <sohcrates> What's up
[11:14:11] <Sgeo_> Well, with the latter, seems I don't need to actually attach to the DOM to, say, navigate an iframe with a form, and be sure it's only navigating the iframe and not the parent document, which is cool
[11:14:49] <Sgeo_> http://jsfiddle.net/2sxxdbuu/
[11:17:46] <Sgeo_> Is it a disaster if I _don't_ do this though?
[11:19:10] <Sgeo_> That is, could http://jsfiddle.net/11fkjd4j/1/ have different behavior in some browsers?
[11:26:18] <Alina-malina> ok i have an object and i know where it is how can i change the color of that object: obj[0].textContent?
[11:50:40] <litropy> Alina-malina, as far as I know, objects are just text. $( '#myid' ).css( 'background-color', '#CCC' ) ); where #CCC is the hexvalue of the color
[11:51:42] <litropy> To be more accurate, as far as I know, objects are like an array with attributes.
[11:52:46] <Alina-malina> litropy, yes i fugurd that out already tnx
[12:05:08] <gurke_> good night. :)
[12:28:31] <mnms_> is it normal if I hide modal (div), selects which are inside this div change theirs selected option ?
[12:31:01] <Woet> no, it isn't
[12:31:06] <Woet> show your code.
[12:33:41] <mnms_> Woet: it is realy basic code, but I use also bootstrap and I bought some bootstrap theme maybe there is a problem
[12:33:47] <Woet> maybe
[12:33:48] <Woet> maybe not
[12:37:34] <mnms_> Woet: Ok if its not normal it is answer for me
[12:37:47] <mnms_> Woet: cause I dont know how to prepare everything
[12:37:51] <mnms_> in fiddle
[13:26:35] <texas_697> can someone take a look at my plunker. I am trying to save the css zoom level to local storage. I am using a jquery function but I cannot figureout how i can save it.  http://plnkr.co/edit/XIaf50FPqjPhYTsUambW?p=preview
[13:33:43] <P0RK> This has got to be the easiest question yet: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/05xsawk9/8/
[13:33:54] <P0RK> I can't figure out what illegal character it is seeing...
[13:34:45] <P0RK> jshint says unexpected " but that doesn't make any sense
[13:49:13] <ngharo> P0RK: those arn't normal double quotes
[13:49:21] <ngharo> theyre fancy ones
[13:49:34] <P0RK> I just noticed that. Thanks. What a piece of ____ MS Word is.
[14:52:39] <shwaiil> Q: Is there a plugin for event mouse drag ? I've been working on a project with touch events and now I'd like to have the same behaviour with the mouse. I know about hammer and jquery ui but I'm looking for something more specific that I could used on both devices. Any tips ? Thanks!

[19:24:34] <Yahkob> is there a way to find out which version of jQuery a site is using? I'm not talking just $.fn.jquery
[19:24:48] <Yahkob> like differentiating between ui,mobile or regular if thatmakes sense
[19:25:24] <tw2113> they all have their own versions
[19:26:35] <Yahkob> I guess the problem im trtying to solve here is to use a headless browser and a node server to check if an arbitrary site uses jQuery
[19:26:45] <Yahkob> but i want to be able to tell every version it uses
[19:27:24] <Yahkob> and with a headless browser like zombie i can jsut do something like if(browser.window.jQuery){console.log('success')}
[19:27:37] <Yahkob> but i cant find out all the versions i guess
[19:27:56] <tw2113> not from just checking browser.window.jQuery
[19:28:08] <tw2113> jQuery UI has its own and jQuery Mobile has its own
[19:28:13] <tw2113> you need to check for all 3
[19:28:36] <Yahkob> how do you check for those?
[19:28:39] <Yahkob> they arent on the window?
[19:28:48] <tw2113> that part i don't know
[19:28:54] <Yahkob> tricky
[19:29:00] <Yahkob> sounds very tricky
[19:29:01] <tw2113> but i would bet they have their own properties with version in them
[19:30:11] <tw2113> http://stackoverflow.com/a/9934483
[19:30:19] <Yahkob> But if you loaded all 3 of them (i dont know who would) wouldnt $ be overwritten each time?
[19:30:37] <Yahkob> ah thanks
[19:31:08] <tw2113> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/is-there-no-way-to-check-jquery-mobile-version
[19:32:57] <Yahkob> yeah I just saw that as well
[19:33:29] <clu3> hi guys I have $(".recording").bind("play") and a $(document).on("click", ".recording", cb_function) . Inside this cb_function, i do a $(this).trigger("play"). Now this works fine but not for the newly dynamically added elements. How to make "bind" work like "live" ?thanks
[19:39:07] <shoky_> clu3: you can delegate using .on on an ancestor element, just like you did for the "click" event
[19:39:23] <clu3> shoky, oh i see
[19:40:33] <shoky_> that's exactly how .live() used to work, btw
[19:40:47] <Yahkob> heh just discovered $.mobile.version will do the trick as well tw2113
[19:48:21] <vacho> guys how to I target this row? <tr role="row" class="odd" data-guest-id="44840">
[19:48:31] <vacho> I want to target it by data-guest-id..how to do that?
[19:49:01] <tw2113> are you trying to get the row or the data in the data-attribute
[19:49:13] <vacho> $('tr data-guest-id=[44840]').remove();  didn't work
[20:19:31] <__joshua____> $('tr[data-guest-id=44840]').remove()
[20:35:37] <sohcrates> Hi! Is anyone actively on?
[20:38:34] <shoky_> no
[20:38:55] <sohcrates> Thanks
[20:39:21] <shoky_> that's sarcasm. just ask your question if you have one
[20:39:35] <shoky_> i.e. don't ask to ask
[20:43:28] <gpw> Hi All, I want to filter through a table by user input, what's the best method here?
[20:44:38] <__joshua____> gpw: more specifics
[20:51:08] <sohcrates> It's not a big deal question. I am a noobie and am wondering why the example on the learn.jquery page doesn't show off a little more of jQuery's sexy animations. Do you think the example code is a great example to show complete beginners the special effects of jQuery? Do you use the special effects a lot on your sites?
[21:52:25] <cardiak> figured it out...
[21:58:59] <athan> Hey everyone... I can't seem to get jquery loaded via a cdn to my site. `jQuery`, nor `$` are terms able to be referenced... could someone check this out to make sure I'm sane? http://lpaste.net/111066
[21:59:14] <athan> They're the last elements inside my <body>, if that helps.
[21:59:24] <athan> should I have them after </body>?
[22:14:18] <Uhkis> it's src, not href
