[00:38:14] <ravenzz> let's say that an element has top value of 50% and a negative margin top (eg -halfOfItsSize). Will $elem.offset().top return its top - margintop value ?
[00:38:32] <juha_> have you tried?
[00:39:11] <ravenzz> not directly
[00:39:17] <ravenzz> ok let me try that

[00:50:31] <pneftali> hi guys - do you know what event is used by twitter when composing tweets the moment a character is inputted ? it seems not using keyup.
[00:50:52] <ENQ> key press?
[00:51:07] <ENQ> and why not keyup
[00:51:57] <Cork> keyup doesn't catch keyrepeat
[00:52:12] <pneftali> ENQ: when i do ctrl + v the counter only updates after the all keys are up
[00:52:32] <pneftali> that when using keyup
[00:52:46] <Cork> pneftali: why not just inspect the js?
[00:53:02] <Cork> they might handle onpaste
[00:53:29] <pneftali> i don't know how to inspect event calls, mind telling me how ?
[00:54:26] <Cork> pneftali: just search through the pages code
[00:56:55] <pneftali> that's alot of minified codes :c

[01:03:28] <crazy_> hi, I've got a problem... I'm working with facebook apps
[01:03:45] <crazy_> and something rare happens
[01:04:02] <crazy_> when i use the Load function, all the variables seem to reset
[01:04:21] <crazy_> so they no longer work in the loaded page
[01:04:31] <Colonel_Panic> Hey can anyone help me out with this tabs issue? I've been working on it for hours and hours now and have asked numerous times
[01:04:33] <crazy_> but in localhost, it works
[01:04:44] <crazy_> have a look please!
[01:04:45] <crazy_> http://apps.facebook.com/igualitoa/
[01:04:47] <Colonel_Panic> with barely a response
[01:05:09] <KolakCC> Colonel_Panic: well, tell us what the issue is?
[01:05:49] <Colonel_Panic> I have an extremely complex user interface with lots of scripts and 3 sets of tabs
[01:06:20] <Colonel_Panic> there are jquery dialog boxes, scrolling tables, sortable tables, etc.
[01:06:30] <Colonel_Panic> and it all has to be switchable via 3 sets of tabs
[01:06:49] <Colonel_Panic> there's a top set of tabs that determines nearly all the rest of the page
[01:07:03] <Colonel_Panic> I'm thinking it's probably best to just do a page refresh for that
[01:07:18] <Colonel_Panic> but the other 2 sets of tabs simply refuse to work at all
[01:07:53] <crazy_> you could send an example of the problem?
[01:07:54] <Colonel_Panic> could there maybe be some kind of conflict among all the scripts?
[01:07:56] <KolakCC> Colonel_Panic: url, testcase,
[01:08:01] <crazy_> yep
[01:08:06] <Colonel_Panic> I'll have to send it via a zipped file

[01:11:26] <Colonel_Panic> I need sleep but I need to get this done even more
[01:11:37] <program> <crazy>the form get load but its validation doesnot work after that

[01:13:00] <program> <crazy> how to retian forms valiadtion after the loading it into another page
[01:13:03] <Colonel_Panic> this is one of those situations where the business people and designers go nuts together without any input at all from the developers who have to actually make this thing work
[01:14:57] <program> my valiadation plugin doesnot work after the html form get loaded into another page div element
[01:15:01] <Colonel_Panic> I'm warning you, it kinda looks like ass in Firefox
[01:15:24] <program> is there any way
[01:15:54] <crazy_> program: try puting the form validation inside the loaded code
[01:16:30] <Colonel_Panic> KolaCC, have you had a chance to look at it?
[01:16:49] <crazy_> program: and the loaded code must not contain header tags and body tags
[01:17:07] <Colonel_Panic> KolakCC, have you had a chance to look at it?
[01:17:32] <KolakCC> Colonel_Panic: can't receive files on this client, sorry.
[01:18:03] <KolakCC> oh, I didn't read enough. let me take a look
[01:18:25] <ravenzz> So I have this plugin (don't be scared by its size) http://jsfiddle.net/4uEEz/ You can try to reproduce the issue I am experiencing by clicking the Open link at the ending part of the page. You'll see that the overlay will be fixed or absolute positioned alternatively. Why? :| (_adjustPostion is the method that calculate the position)
[01:19:13] <program> <crazy> do you have any code sample??
[01:19:14] <Kingsy> this is what I assumed.. but it doesnt do anything --> jQuery('.main-container').attr('style', 'height:'+jQuery(window).height()-800+'px !important');
[01:19:34] <ravenzz> ?css @ Kingsy
[01:19:36] <Kingsy> the -800 is to just create a crazy rule so I can see its being applied
[01:19:36] <bot-t> Kingsy, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[01:19:46] <KolakCC> Colonel_Panic: oh dear. why do you have jquerys in html onclicks?
[01:19:51] <crazy_> program: yes, wait a seccond
[01:20:16] <Kingsy> ravenzz: can you set important with css() ? I couldnt find a way
[01:20:21] <program> <crazy> ok
[01:20:37] <ravenzz> Kingsy css('background', 'red !important')
[01:20:41] <Kingsy> ah
[01:20:42] <Kingsy> ffs
[01:20:43] <Kingsy> thanks
[01:21:09] <ravenzz> or css({ backgroundColor : 'red !important', color: 'white' })
[01:22:42] <KolakCC> Colonel_Panic: it's not working because you have the wrong id's in the html onclicks.

[01:26:03] <nanovirus> HI, I'm hoping someone can see a simple mistake I am making, whereby I make an ajax call and instead of getting the 100 results I expect, I get 200 results, the first 100 of which are undefined.  I'm using the results to populate two selects (both have the same values)... http://jsfiddle.net/NgHJ4/
[01:26:30] <program> <crazy_> let me try
[01:27:57] <KolakCC> nanovirus: you sure that json is valid?
[01:28:37] <nanovirus> KolakCC, I think so, how can I make sure? All the other ajax request using the same method work fine
[01:28:55] <crazy_> program: imagine this is file 2: http://jsfiddle.net/4rfGu/
[01:29:22] <KolakCC> nanovirus: just look though your json data and see if there are any inconsistancies there. I don't see an issue with your code
[01:29:42] <nanovirus> KolakCC, ok, I'll take a look and report back
[01:30:51] <KolakCC> nanovirus: I'll be leaving now, try to get somebody else to help
[01:31:08] <nanovirus> KolakCC, ok, cheers for the heads up anyways ;)
[01:31:17] <Colonel_Panic> KolakCC, just take that code out. The tabs are supposed to be handled by JQuery, not inline JavaScript.
[01:31:56] <Colonel_Panic> Even with the correct div id's, the divs will switch but the proper tab styles won't
[01:32:22] <Colonel_Panic> I forgot to remove that inline crap before I zipped up the file. Sorry.
[01:33:28] <Kingsy> ok I just cant get this working, what have I missed --> var width = jQuery(window).width()+'px !important';    alert(width) --> 1920px !important       jQuery('.main-container').css('width', width);        alert(jQuery('.main-container').width()); --> 900px; (normal css rule)   wtf ?
[01:33:36] <KolakCC> Colonel_Panic: I don't see any jquery bits that use any click handling
[01:33:36] <program> <crazy_> not working
[01:33:39] <program> http://jsfiddle.net/qw9eL/
[01:33:46] <KolakCC> anyways, gotta go, sorry.
[01:33:51] <Colonel_Panic> Click handling?
[01:33:56] <program> see the code here  the form
[01:34:03] <Colonel_Panic> Its the JQuery UI.
[01:34:28] <Colonel_Panic> I'm trying to implement the .tabs function of the JQuery UI
[01:34:36] <Colonel_Panic> but it's not working
[01:35:06] <Colonel_Panic> As far as I can tell, my form is correct
[01:35:16] <Kingsy> ravenzz: can you spot anything ?
[01:35:52] <Blindie> hello, is ther a way to change the html title with $(window).hashchange?
[01:36:06] <Dashiad> Hello..I have a page with an iframe in it.Both use jquery.Problem is, in the iframe, jquery doesnt find any elements ( $('#id') has length==0 , while document.getElementById('id') returns the DOM element...Is there some incompatibilty in using jquery both in the top document, and the iframe?
[01:36:19] <KolakCC> Colonel_Panic: one last thing - did you already see this error? "Uncaught jQuery UI Tabs: Mismatching fragment identifier. "
[01:36:25] <Colonel_Panic> the tabs are constructed in the form of a UL, <a> tags are added with the id of a div as the href, and the JQuery UI .tabs is initialized via JavaScript
[01:36:34] <Colonel_Panic> yeah I've seen that
[01:37:02] <crazy_> program: loaded code must not have $(document).ready(function(){
[01:37:08] <Colonel_Panic> what is a fragment identifier?
[01:37:08] <Blindie> i thest document.getElementsByTagName('title')[0].text = "New Title"; but i get undefined
[01:37:40] <program> wait a minte i am providing the loaded code
[01:37:43] <KolakCC> Blindie: Are you confusing jquery with javascript..?
[01:37:48] <KolakCC> Colonel_Panic: haven't the slightest, sorry.
[01:37:48] <crazy_> yep
[01:38:02] <Blindie> yes
[01:39:35] <Blindie> i have no reload an the page, the content is loading with $(window).hashchange only the title didn't change

[01:52:56] <program> how i cal load my page so that it  its validation will work on the loaded page
[01:53:34] <codeAssassin> program: probably enable validation after the ajax call is complete
[01:54:44] <codeAssassin> program: you can just use $.get(url, function(data) { $('#signupId').html(data).validate(); }); to get the form
[01:55:10] <codeAssassin> program: i just did validate, but i dont know which validation module you are using, but i think you get the gist
[01:56:43] <program> i am using jquery form validation
[01:56:58] <codeAssassin> program: should work
[01:57:10] <program> let me try
[01:57:35] <phrearch> hi
[01:58:24] <phrearch> if i want to select multiple classes that look like foo_nl , foo_en , foo_zh, could i just use * for that? like $('.foo_*') ?
[01:58:25] <codeAssassin> program: just run that gorgeous validation function on it
[01:58:40] <program> ok
[01:59:51] <mink> phrearch, try $('[class^=foo'); or else similar :)
[02:00:29] <phrearch> mink: ah thanks!
[02:00:43] <program> <codeAssassin> it does not work
[02:00:44] <mink> no problem :)

[02:03:14] <program> i am  able to load... but after loading the form validation does not work
[02:03:46] <codeAssassin> program: are you sure the page you are loading the form in also has the jquery validation code loaded?
[02:04:05] <codeAssassin> program: it's just an action on the dom, and you're loading it into the dom
[02:04:10] <codeAssassin> program: can i see your code?
[02:04:49] <program> jsfiddle.net/qw9eL/
[02:04:58] <program> this is my form.html
[02:05:31] <program> and i am loading this page into another page http://jsfiddle.net/sudhannsu/yRkFT/
[02:05:45] <codeAssassin> program: obviously that doesn't work
[02:05:50] <codeAssassin> you didn't do as i told you
[02:06:02] <program> then how to do that
[02:06:04] <codeAssassin> program: remove the validation code in form.html
[02:06:18] <program> ok
[02:06:21] <codeAssassin> program: the validation should happen in signup.html
[02:06:50] <codeAssassin> program: use $.get(url, function(data) { $('#signupId').html(data).validate(); // <-- your validation function there });
[02:07:01] <codeAssassin> to call the validation method AFTER you load your form into the DOM
[02:10:51] <program> <codeAssassian> is there any method  to fetch the code from.html to signup.html
[02:11:49] <program> i dont want to remove the validation code from the form.html as i reqire the standalone form.html to validate in my application on later time

[02:16:42] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/39487191
[02:17:54] <merlin1978> Is the latest jQuery library backward compatible?
[02:18:19] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/15792857
[02:18:29] <merlin1978> Is jQuery 1.7 backward compatible with jQuery 1.2  ?
[02:18:37] <Nece228> this is jquery code
[02:19:25] <Nece228> the fact is that this code doesnt work if i do stuff with second row
[02:19:35] <Nece228> only on first row onkeyup works
[02:20:12] <Haprog> merlin1978: short answer: no.
[02:20:19] <phrearch> codeAssassin: thanks, that works fine
[02:20:59] <Nece228> this could be that first row and second row shares same ids for inputs but i cant figure out how to fix that
[02:21:15] <Haprog> merlin1978: if you update jQuery, you should check that everything works ok. you may have to do some adjustments to make everything work depending on what methods or plugins your site uses.
[02:21:53] <tinix> hi all, can someone please take a peek at this and help me figure out where the nulls are coming from after pressing "inflate" http://jsfiddle.net/tinix/8jUWg/
[02:22:21] <raj> is .parent().parent('.hi') any faster than .closest('.hi')?
[02:23:01] <merlin1978> Haprog: But in your experience have you encountered major problems upgrading to the latest versions?
[02:23:35] <Haprog> I have never even used jQuery as old as 1.2.
[02:24:03] <Haprog> and I haven't upgraded that much jQuery. Only few minor stuff from 1.6 -> 1.7
[02:25:00] <Haprog> I'd guess you can have some headaches upgrading from 1.2 to 1.7 if using lots of plugins.
[02:25:19] <Haprog> and ofc may also need to upgrade plugins to never version if there are such
[02:25:56] <Haprog> it's easy to try out though. just switch the jQuery lib to a newer one and see if everything seems to work or not.
[02:26:16] <Haprog> maybe you're lucky and it'll just work
[02:27:03] <merlin1978> Haprog: Yeah hope so, I am maintaining a legacy system and many are including it :(
[02:27:41] <Haprog> when dealing with legacy systems it may be easier to just stick with the old version though
[02:27:45] <Haprog> as long as everything still works
[02:28:08] <merlin1978> Haprog: jquery ui dialog is not working with 1.2
[02:28:10] <merlin1978> :(
[02:28:10] <Haprog> why upgrade? or if you really need some new functions of newer jQuery also. you CAN load multiple version of jQuery
[02:28:22] <Haprog> using the noClonflict mode
[02:28:27] <Haprog> *noConflict
[02:28:34] <merlin1978> Haprog: what is that
[02:28:35] <merlin1978> ?
[02:30:03] <merlin1978> Haprog: Is there a way to unload the jquery library so I could load the new one
[02:30:04] <merlin1978> ?
[02:30:12] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing Can anyone tell me why when you hover the big image on the right the magnifier disappears behind the image, and is not on top?
[02:31:49] <Haprog> merlin1978: http://web.enavu.com/daily-tip/using-multiple-versions-of-jquery-on-the-same-page/ here's an example
[02:33:39] <merlin1978> Haprog: thanks I think this is the solution to my problem
[02:33:47] <Haprog> :)
[02:38:02] <codeAssassin> damn, just wasted 15m making some sample code, then the idiot just left
[02:46:39] <merlin1978> Haprog: By the way how do we set jquery ui to used the latest jquery library?
[02:56:22] <tocka> Hey guys, wanted to ask, why doesnt this work?  window.location.replace("http://url.com".("#username").val());
[02:58:38] <Haprog> merlin1978: I'm not sure. haven't used noConflict or jQuery UI much. Google it.
[03:00:22] <NodeX> tocka : ???? because it's bad syntax
[03:00:32] <merlin1978> Haprog: thanks
[03:03:37] <sacho> tocka, in javascript, strings are concatenated with +.
[03:04:00] <Haprog> tocka: if you want to edit the window.location you need to set it: window.location = window.location.replace(...); and there's a syntax error after url.com when you use a dot. you should probably use + to concatenate the strings
[03:08:00] <tocka> Thank you

[03:18:54] <shoky> er
[03:19:07] <shwaiil> shoky tks for looking. yes, previously I did
[03:19:12] <shoky> shwaiil also you can't return state like that when using an asynchronous ajax call

[03:20:22] <Flo0815> hey guys. with jQueryUI i have an overlay. this is triggered by a button. I want the overlay be created when the button is clicked (it's not in the inital HTML). Problem is, that it says: overlay not found. so the overlay-initiator called first, the overlay-creator is called after this. How can i change that? How can i edit the order of trigger-calls?
[03:20:51] <shoky> shwaiil:  your 'return state' runs BEFORE the $.post success callback runs
[03:21:46] <shwaiil> shoky: I see, i'm still reading

[03:32:22] <shoky> also i don't see any event handling except the .on('click' ..
[03:32:40] <Flo0815> document.ready ->$(".trigger[rel]").overlay({effect: 'apple', mask: '#000'});
[03:32:45] <Flo0815> thats the event binding
[03:32:51] <Flo0815> ok forget it
[03:32:56] <Flo0815> i can't eexplain it today
[03:33:02] <Flo0815> feels like i'm still drunk
[03:33:04] <Flo0815> or sth
[03:33:15] <Flo0815> thx anyway
[03:33:25] <Vooloo> can you design the jquery modal window however you like? using themeroller you can just change colors
[03:33:38] <Flo0815> Vooloo: yes you can
[03:33:42] <Flo0815> all in the css
[03:37:25] <shwaiil> shoky: about the async callback, I think the solution is something like this, from what I've read http://pastie.org/4107765 you mind havling a look ?
[03:39:10] <shoky> O_O
[03:39:49] <shoky> shwaiil: definitely not :)
[03:40:48] <shoky> shwaiil: you CANT make the return value depend on an asynchronous call, otherwise it wouldnt be asynchronous
[03:41:43] <shwaiil> shoky: but the point of using the callback isn't to wait for the ajax return ?
[03:41:49] <shoky> it is
[03:41:58] <shoky> but not for then doing a  'return someValue'
[03:42:09] <shoky> to be returned from the ORIGINAL function that made the ajax call
[03:42:16] <shoky> you're thinking about it totally wrong
[03:42:18] <fuchstronaut> having <div> <span></span> </div> how do i set the text of div without deleting the span inside of it??
[03:45:26] <tinix> http://jsfiddle.net/tinix/fDXyJ/ how would i get the index on the appended fields to be correct? currently they are one off and compounded each time i add a new set of fields. ie: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, but i want them to be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
[03:45:58] <shoky> shwaiil: http://pastie.org/4107804
[03:46:17] <codeAssassin> fuchstronaut: easiest way would be to copy the span, and then insert it after manipulating the div
[03:46:31] <fuchstronaut> (codeAssassin): thanks
[03:46:35] <codeAssassin> fuchstronaut: http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[03:46:54] <zoster> we're trying to open a new jQuery plugin-project: Tities
[03:47:01] <zoster> anyone willing to participate is welcomed to infor me :)
[03:47:32] <shoky> don't you mean kravmaga.js
[03:47:52] <zoster> mossad.js "ass-well" :D
[03:48:00] <shoky> h
[03:48:30] <shwaiil> shoky: I'm seeing the pastie you sent me
[03:48:57] <codeAssassin> fuchstronaut: holy crap it worked http://jsfiddle.net/eFXbX/1/
[03:49:05] <shoky> shwaiil i just removed the illogical parts from it ;p
[03:49:31] <codeAssassin> i swear i love jquery
[03:49:41] <fuchstronaut> (codeAssassin): why shouldn't it? :)
[03:50:23] <shwaiil> yes, but this is what I came from. Unless i'm not seeing it clearly in the moment. I had to change it because I need the submit to continue running server side instead of being prevented by js
[03:53:43] <shwaiil> That's why i'm trying to return to the original .submit() function the state from the callback, I mean, I was trying to :)
[03:54:59] <codeAssassin> fuchstronaut: usually i dont get it right the first time when writing some code snippet, this is the 2nd time in a row i got it the first time lll
[03:55:06] <codeAssassin> *lol
[03:56:35] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing Can anyone tell me why when you hover the big image on the right the magnifier disappears behind the image, and is not on top?
[03:57:15] <CrysAk> hi, I'm trying to follow this http://jqueryui.com/docs/Getting_Started , but i cannot even get the example datpicker to work ... this is what i currently have ... where am i going wrong? .. clicking in the blank text field does nothing http://pastebin.com/Z26bPXW8
[04:01:48] <shoky> shwaiil: then why did you have e.preventDefault()
[04:03:25] <shwaiil> shoky: The idea is, the user tries to login, if there's one error is presented otherwise, it goes on server side. To be honest shoky, since the session will be init to the user, I just need to refresh the page, just realised that.
[04:06:14] <shoky> shwaiil: you had e.preventDefault()  but you still wanted to maybe submit the form? that doesn't make sense
[04:06:41] <shwaiil> shoky: yeah, it didn't make sense. Thanks for looking
[04:07:32] <shwaiil> I was basically trying to re-submit without preventing, based on the input param "json"  being valid or not
[04:07:42] <shwaiil> not a good practice.
[04:08:15] <shoky> shwaiil you COULD do something like.. http://pastie.org/4107804
[04:09:00] <shwaiil> shoky, yeah truth ;)
[04:09:19] <shoky> but the whole idea of making an ajax request to decide if you want to allow the form to submit or not doesnt sound too great, unless you're using something targeted for validation
[04:09:36] <shoky> i dunno
[04:11:34] <M1k1> help pls everyone link me the jquery 1.8 development status?
[04:13:22] <shwaiil> yah

[04:22:18] <nilesh786> source code not show that appended div
[04:22:19] <astropirate> ofcourse
[04:22:42] <codeAssassin> nilesh786: if you open up firebug, what are you getting back from the $.get method
[04:22:56] <zoster> codeAssassin: FRENCH FOREIGN LEGION!
[04:23:11] <nilesh786> result is comming
[04:23:30] <codeAssassin> zoster: ahh ze military ja
[04:23:37] <zoster> yaaaa
[04:23:40] <zoster> military !
[04:24:39] <codeAssassin> if i look at my daily stats in mw3...i'd say i would have died 720 times already
[04:24:48] <codeAssassin> and thats not productive for my health
[04:25:01] <zoster> real military is
[04:25:06] <zoster> you get to run every momrning
[04:25:16] <Flo0815> real military is for liver exercise only
[04:25:36] <Flo0815> at least in germany
[04:25:47] <zoster> germany once had it's military
[04:25:50] <fuchstronaut> real military over here is just a waste of my taxmoney for some drunk losers that can't put together anything to get a real job
[04:25:57] <zoster> it was back in first half of 1940's
[04:26:15] <codeAssassin> lol zoster
[04:26:19] <Flo0815> :P
[04:26:24] <zoster> well yea
[04:26:27] <zoster> today it sucks
[04:26:36] <zoster> like every other military
[04:26:47] <codeAssassin> ofcourse it sucks, its all black ops into the middle east, china etc and peace missions
[04:26:47] <astropirate> code monkeys who told you you could stop coding and start talking. back to work. chop chop
[04:26:48] <zoster> with exception of irans, north korea, china,
[04:26:55] <zoster> usa, france, uk
[04:27:04] <zoster> everything else is UN task force krap
[04:27:13] <codeAssassin> so unless you're going GIGN, you're not going to see much action
[04:27:19] <zoster> no
[04:27:27] <zoster> there's a special unit in french foreign legion
[04:27:32] <Flo0815> i'm in the GIGN at mw3
[04:27:35] <zoster> called 2rep - 2nd parachute regiment
[04:27:36] <Flo0815> thats enough :)
[04:27:43] <zoster> and 2rep trains guys from GIGN
[04:27:46] <codeAssassin> Flo0815: Close enough bro
[04:27:47] <zoster> and other similar units
[04:28:19] <fuchstronaut> now, where is all this talk jquery related? :P
[04:28:36] <codeAssassin> zoster: yeah training, but as far as my military buddy is blabbering only GIGN gets put on black op missions
[04:28:40] <Flo0815> jquery is our weapon, we're all soldiers of the web
[04:28:45] <Flo0815> from the interwebs
[04:28:47] <codeAssassin> mainly to support SAS

[04:31:48] <Flo0815> u think so?
[04:31:50] <fuchstronaut> thats rape time
[04:31:51] <Flo0815> ^^
[04:31:51] <fuchstronaut> ye
[04:32:07] <anli__> I have a problem printing divs with absolute positioning, has anyone here experienced the same thing?
[04:32:12] <Flo0815> you wanna play a game called "rape? - NO! - That's the point! :)
[04:32:21] <zoster> hahaž
[04:32:23] <zoster> well I do
[04:32:23] <fuchstronaut> If you say surprise, it's not a rape.
[04:32:27] <zoster> I have nothing more to live for
[04:32:35] <zoster> except to make wars for not-my-country
[04:32:56] <Flo0815> anli__: what is your problem?
[04:33:12] <nilesh786> jQuery $(“<script></script>”).appendTo(“head”); does not show up in GENERATED source code. HOW?
[04:33:19] <zoster> anli__ -- post some code
[04:33:26] <Flo0815> nilesh786: look at the DOM
[04:33:28] <Flo0815> there it is
[04:33:36] <Flo0815> or check it with firebug or similiar
[04:33:44] <zoster> nilesh786 - try with document.createElement('script')
[04:33:53] <Flo0815> if you look at the sourcecode it wont show it
[04:33:56] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing Can anyone tell me why when you hover the big image on the right the magnifier disappears behind the image, and is not on top?
[04:34:46] <Flo0815> fRAiLtY-: z-index?
[04:35:03] <fRAiLtY-> I've already tried a z-index of 2 and it didn't work, which value would work?
[04:35:18] <Flo0815> give both elements a z-index
[04:36:20] <nilesh786> When new text is placed in a div tag using jQuery, it is not shown in the page source view - Why?
[04:37:33] <pachet> because the browser's native page source view is the result of making a new request for the current page
[04:37:39] <Flo0815> nilesh786: because the sourcecode won't refresh
[04:37:50] <pachet> and generating a representation of the dom based on the req response
[04:38:08] <pachet> nilesh786: try using a web inspector, like chrome dev tools or firebug
[04:39:25] <nilesh786> it show in web inspector not in view source
[04:40:00] <pachet> that's right
[04:40:02] <Cork> nilesh786: source view shows what existed when the page loads
[04:40:18] <Cork> unless you use ctrl+a and view selected source
[04:40:20] <nebmo88> after a jquery post and it returns an array, how do I split it? (http://pastebin.com/ZfXzi97q)
[04:40:22] <CrysAk> can anyone help ... I've got datepicker with jquery UI working but i can't for the life of me get this working http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ ... i have referenced the.js file in the header and called the function but still nothing
[04:40:24] <nilesh786> yes
[04:41:00] <Cork> nebmo88: use json instead on plain text
[04:41:36] <Flo0815> CrysAk: did you include the timepicker plugin before jquery?
[04:41:40] <Flo0815> in your head?
[04:41:44] <Flo0815> <head>
[04:41:45] <CrysAk> Flo0815 i have this http://pastebin.com/yZTVfVpM
[04:41:54] <nebmo88> cork: is that in the page it submits to? this echo's: echo json_encode($array);
[04:42:09] <Flo0815> CrysAk: swap line4 and 5
[04:42:15] <nilesh786> how can i get the id of that div that not view in source code?
[04:42:21] <CrysAk> Flo0815 ahh perfect, thanks so much!
[04:42:24] <Flo0815> :)
[04:42:25] <Flo0815> np
[04:42:30] <CrysAk> was going mad!
[04:42:42] <Flo0815> happy i could help
[04:42:51] <Flo0815> nilesh786: how is the div generated?
[04:43:08] <nilesh786> append()
[04:43:22] <codeAssassin> nilesh786: thats not how you create a div
[04:43:35] <Flo0815> nilesh: you have some code to show?
[04:44:03] <nilesh786> http://pastebin.com/5AanrzXH
[04:44:06] <codeAssassin> nilesh786: $('<div />').append(data).appendTo(<something>) however, could work
[04:44:39] <codeAssassin> or is there a <div id="topping"></div> in your dom?
[04:46:07] <nilesh786> no its generated from php code
[04:46:16] <Cork> nebmo88: i meant the dataType
[04:46:26] <codeAssassin> but i'm not seeing the code
[04:46:35] <codeAssassin> well i see a span
[04:46:35] <Cork> nebmo88: set dataType: 'json'
[04:46:47] <codeAssassin> thats about it
[04:51:01] <anli__> Is there some jquery extensions to add an onprint handler that puts img tags inside every div that has a background thats an url?
[04:51:10] <anli__> Before a page is printed
[04:52:07] <codeAssassin> there is this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/534977/javascript-event-handler-for-print
[04:52:47] <tocka> Maybe anyone has an alternative to this? http://egorkhmelev.github.com/jslider/ , this slider works perfectly but what I need is that the pointer would be not only draggable but also you could skip it.
[04:53:34] <codeAssassin> tocka: for images?
[04:53:41] <codeAssassin> tocka: never mind
[04:53:49] <tocka> nah :)
[04:53:56] <tocka> like a price slider lets say
[04:54:06] <codeAssassin> tocka: yeah lol i saw
[04:54:15] <fuchstronaut> how can i apply different style to jquery UI dialogs???
[04:54:17] <codeAssassin> tocka:  i use this one http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[04:54:37] <codeAssassin> tocka: it has that nice "skip" thing you want
[04:55:22] <codeAssassin> fuchstronaut: it's just css
[04:55:32] <tocka> thanks:)
[04:55:36] <fuchstronaut> i oversaw theres a custom class i can set
[04:55:56] <codeAssassin> tocka: np man, jquery ui is awesome sauce in a bottle
[04:57:45] <codeAssassin> fuchstronaut: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/, go to the "Theming" tab
[04:57:49] <codeAssassin> does that help you out?
[04:57:56] <chilversc_> is there any method to causes a navigation equivilent to clicking on a hyperlink?
[04:58:04] <fuchstronaut> as i said, i found out i can set a class, but htnaks
[04:58:06] <fRAiLtY-> On here: when the table (click Price Matrix button) is refreshed via AJAX it changes ID so the hard-coded table ID no longer works in jQuery. Is there a way to get it dynamically or just do a blanket search on all tables or similar so my col/row selectors work http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[04:58:12] <codeAssassin> chilversc_: $(something).click()
[04:58:38] <chilversc_> codeAssassin: I mean I have a url I want to navigate to, during a click handler (or some other event handler)
[04:58:56] <chilversc_> but I want it to act like a standard click, (eg, if middle click, new tab instead, etc)
[04:59:06] <fuchstronaut> (fRAiLtY-): I'm not sure if i understood right, but try access them via the children-method of a parent element??`
[04:59:28] <Flo0815> fRAiLtY- $('#parent table').
[04:59:31] <chilversc_> trouble is, things like middle click, or holding ctrl are browser specific
[04:59:53] <codeAssassin> what are you setting the click event on? what is the purpose?
[05:00:09] <codeAssassin> chilversc_: i'm not getting your use case
[05:00:13] <chilversc_> codeAssassin: the click event is being applied to an svg element somehow
[05:00:13] <fRAiLtY-> So put it in a "blank table" which is the parent, and have the dynamic one as the child?
[05:00:30] <chilversc_> codeAssassin: during a click handle for that element, I want to open a related page
[05:00:57] <codeAssassin> chilversc_: does the click event also change the document's location?
[05:00:59] <Flo0815> fRAiLtY-: put the table in a div '#parent'
[05:01:12] <fRAiLtY-> Flo0815:  it's in #matrix-container
[05:01:15] <fRAiLtY-> which is a parent div
[05:01:19] <chilversc_> codeAssassin: that's what I'm trying to work out how to do, but still honor the way links normally work in the browser
[05:01:36] <Flo0815> ok so get it by $('#matrix-container table')
[05:01:40] <fRAiLtY-> ah cool
[05:01:42] <fRAiLtY-> cheers
[05:01:45] <Flo0815> :)
[05:02:23] <Flo0815> fRAiLtY-: http://api.jquery.com/descendant-selector/
[05:02:49] <codeAssassin> chilversc_: i dont know how links react to user input. never actually studied that. But i happen to have read somewhere that stuff like holding the CTRL is hyperlink tag (a) specific
[05:02:50] <zoster> anyone looking for a freelancer? I need a 100EUR job!
[05:03:03] <Flo0815> zoster: who not?
[05:03:06] <shoky> wat will u do with the money? ?!
[05:03:13] <zoster> :D
[05:03:13] <codeAssassin> but if you want to change the URL during an onclick event, just use window.location.href
[05:03:19] <zoster> just give me the job
[05:03:25] <Flo0815> but 300€?
[05:03:29] <Flo0815> aeh 100
[05:03:36] <Flo0815> thats like 2- 3 hours of work
[05:03:36] <codeAssassin> shoky: he's going to get some shakes and gym memberships
[05:03:41] <chilversc_> codeAssassin: but that won't then allow middle clicking/ctrl clicking to open in an new tab
[05:03:43] <Flo0815> what u want to do in this short time
[05:03:47] <chilversc_> codeAssassin: or alt+clicking to download
[05:03:52] <Woet> zoster: rewrite jquery in brainfuck
[05:04:02] <Flo0815> :D
[05:04:06] <Flo0815> tahts a good idea
[05:04:18] <chilversc_> was hoping there was some navigate method that would use the same logic as having clicked on an <a> tag
[05:04:34] <codeAssassin> chilversc_: as i said, that's probably related to the <a> tag anyways, but i don't have hard proof for that. Best thing would be to try and replicate it in jsfiddle
[05:04:47] <codeAssassin> and just cross browser test it i guess
[05:04:58] <anli__> Hm, making div backgrounds printable was not that hard... http://pastebin.com/nhBSidJA
[05:05:22] <anli__> Wonder if it works in all browsers...
[05:05:45] <fuchstronaut> stupid fucking jq ui
[05:06:27] <codeAssassin> chilversc_: i'm (pretty) sure that isnt handled by the event listener but by the browser itself
[05:06:40] <fRAiLtY-> Another odd thing, same page same table, why does the row selector work but the column not….. ? If you select items from stages 1 and 2 you'll see it does nothing on step 1 but selects the row (and the cross-section column cell) on step 2?
[05:06:49] <chilversc_> codeAssassin: right, so was hoping there would be a native method for this
[05:07:20] <Flo0815> fRAiLtY-: i dont think jQuery can select columns of a table. how u wanna select them?
[05:07:26] <codeAssassin> chilversc_: i honestly don't know. i think this is a valid question for stackoverflow
[05:07:32] <Flo0815> oh wait. i'm talking nonsene
[05:07:35] <fRAiLtY-> Flo0815:  It used to work in jsfiddle aaaaaages ago
[05:07:38] <Flo0815> sure it can
[05:07:41] <codeAssassin> chilversc_: most people here don't know that much about event listeners and stuff
[05:07:41] <fRAiLtY-> Just spotted it doesn't work now :x
[05:07:53] <Flo0815> how u want to access the columns
[05:07:58] <fRAiLtY-> Flo0815:  They used to cross-section each other
[05:08:10] <Flo0815> $('table tr td') ?
[05:08:14] <chilversc_> aw, you can't .click() an a tag that isn't in the page
[05:08:19] <fRAiLtY-> each column has a class on it
[05:08:23] <Flo0815> ok
[05:08:24] <fRAiLtY-> col1,col2,col3
[05:08:30] <fRAiLtY-> I think these are/were mapped to the selec
[05:08:41] <Flo0815> so $('table tr td.col1') should do it
[05:08:48] <codeAssassin> chilversc_: it has to be in the DOM for it to function
[05:09:45] <fRAiLtY-> Flo0815:  This is what used to work: http://pastie.org/4108150 attribute127 is the row and attribute 128 is the column, they're selects
[05:10:52] <Flo0815> and what isnt working?
[05:10:53] <sacho> chilversc, you can.
[05:11:22] <chilversc_> sacho: didn't do anything for me in chrome
[05:11:38] <sacho> what didn't?
[05:11:39] <fRAiLtY-> When you select attribute128 (option 1 on the page) it doesn't select/highlight the column as per the class states, however attribute127 (option2) selects the row successfully and shows the cross section in pale green correctly
[05:12:41] <chilversc_> sacho: using .click() on an anchor that hadn't been added to the DOM
[05:13:10] <Flo0815> fRAiLtY-: i need to see the table html
[05:15:00] <sacho> chilversc, you can trigger events added by jquery.
[05:15:25] <zoster> sacho's right
[05:15:32] <Bartzy> Is it OK to use an underscore in a data-* attribute? data-user_id , for example?
[05:16:02] <codeAssassin> sacho: you would be right, but if something isnt in the dom, you cant do anything with it. jquery adds elements to the DOM
[05:16:14] <codeAssassin> actually, javascript does, jquery just wraps the methods
[05:16:15] <sacho> no it doesn't
[05:16:29] <codeAssassin> sacho: i'm pretty sure it does mate
[05:16:36] <sacho> you're pretty wrong
[05:17:14] <codeAssassin> sacho: no i'm not
[05:17:22] <sacho> real..
[05:17:37] <sacho> I suggest continuing this discussion with code samples rather than this
[05:18:49] <chilversc_> sacho: http://jsfiddle.net/BxA56/
[05:19:10] <sacho> I said it works for jquery events
[05:19:34] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/BxA56/1/
[05:19:52] <codeAssassin> sacho: its not that hard, document.createElement https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM:document.createElement <---- Is adding an element to the DOM
[05:20:09] <codeAssassin> sacho: jquery wraps this method, you can look it up in the source
[05:20:10] <sacho> it sure isn't
[05:20:42] <sacho> or you're using the fairly ambigious term DOM in a different way that I understand
[05:20:46] <chilversc_> sacho: right, but I'm after the native anchor click handling
[05:21:43] <chilversc_> odd, .click() doesn't trigger the native handling?
[05:22:04] <zoster> I need 100EUR's. Anyone need a job get done?
[05:22:18] <shoky> zoster clean my apartment
[05:22:24] <chilversc_> ie, http://jsfiddle.net/BxA56/2/
[05:23:22] <codeAssassin> sacho: the DOM is the the browsers Document Object Model. There is only 1, and thats the one i'm referring to
[05:23:23] <codeAssassin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model
[05:23:24] <chilversc_> hmm, so you can use click on an anchor not in the dom, http://jsfiddle.net/BxA56/3/ but its a bit strange I need to use .get(0)
[05:23:47] <sacho> if you're saying that createElement adds elements to the dom tree, you are obviously wrong
[05:23:48] <chilversc_> so $(..).click() doesn't do what I thought it did
[05:24:51] <FernandoBasso> Is this the correct way to get the value of an <option> element: option_value: $('option[value]').val() ?
[05:24:57] <sacho> chilversc, that's not the same function as jquery's click.
[05:25:16] <chilversc_> sacho: right, but I thought jquery's click would call the native handler
[05:26:31] <chilversc_> sacho: at least that's what the docs for .trigger and .triggerHandler seem to imply
[05:26:45] <codeAssassin> sacho: i'm ending this discussing. http://jsfiddle.net/DxhUz/ go to your DOM tab in firebug and look it up
[05:26:59] <sacho> codeAssassin, do you realise what appendTo does?
[05:27:00] <codeAssassin> *discussion
[05:27:08] <sacho> it adds the item to the dom
[05:27:22] <chilversc_> ie, http://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/ "The .triggerHandler() method does not cause the default behavior of an event to occur (such as a form submission)." would imply that .trigger does cause the default behaviour of an event to occur
[05:27:23] <sacho> before that, it's just an element created from the document node of a dom tree
[05:27:30] <sacho> it's not part of the dom tree
[05:27:33] <chilversc_> so then why isn't the default behaviour for click occuring?
[05:27:34] <shoky> FernandoBasso: that's fine, yes
[05:28:57] <FernandoBasso> shoky: Thanks.
[05:28:59] <sacho> chilversc, well, there's some things the jquery event can't replicate
[05:29:07] <chilversc_> so it looks like either, .trigger is in error, or .trigger's documentation is in error, and the comments in the docs seems to suppor this http://api.jquery.com/trigger/#comment-48200854
[05:29:10] <sacho> apparently one of those things is native anchor clicks
[05:29:33] <sacho> "Although .trigger() simulates an event activation, complete with a synthesized event object, it does not perfectly replicate a naturally-occurring event."
[05:40:51] <fRAiLtY-> Flo0815:  http://pastebin.com/yP87qpe7
[05:40:56] <FernandoBasso> option_value is always empty here: https://gist.github.com/2948194
[05:43:04] <chilversc_> hmm, well I have it working, though I'm not quite sure about the solution http://jsfiddle.net/BxA56/4/
[05:43:08] <shoky> FernandoBasso: yea, it should be
[05:43:23] <shoky> FernandoBasso: you only gave it a value inside the data object literal
[05:44:09] <shoky> FernandoBasso: or do you mean it's empty when it gets to the php?
[05:44:27] <FernandoBasso> No. It is empty in js only. (I'm testing in php right now).
[05:44:29] <shoky> FernandoBasso: anyway the alert is wrong
[05:44:46] <shoky> you haven't defined an option_value variable anywhere
[05:44:58] <shoky> only as a property of some object
[05:45:04] <shoky> which isn't the same thing
[05:46:03] <FernandoBasso> I'm sending it to php, and then alerting it back with that function. It works then. Thanks.
[05:46:17] <shoky> mm ok
[05:47:57] <nebmo88> Cork: Ive set the datatype to json but I believe it still needs to split the array... please can you suggest how this can be done.
[05:48:19] <codeAssassin> chilversc_: i'm getting source is undefined
[05:48:20] <Cork> nebmo88: what do you mean by split array?
[05:48:47] <Cork> nebmo88: JSON.parse("[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]")
[05:48:52] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse("[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]")
[05:48:56] <bot-t> Cork: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
[05:49:00] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse("[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]")[5]
[05:49:00] <bot-t> Cork: 6
[05:49:11] <nebmo88> Cork: when i sumit the form it comes back with alert(html) and html is {"message":"Saved @ 18\/06\/12 @ 13:48:27","rdata_id":null}
[05:49:12] <Cork> thats what jquery should be giving you
[05:49:21] <Cork> thats not an array
[05:49:24] <Cork> its an object
[05:49:31] <nebmo88> hmm
[05:49:37] <codeAssassin> yeah result.message
[05:49:38] <Cork> html.message
[05:50:38] <nebmo88> so in the php file it takes the whole array and echo's it: echo json_encode($array);
[05:51:02] <Cork> nebmo88: php is wranging the terms
[05:51:20] <nebmo88> so after, in jquery I need to split what it returns
[05:51:20] <Cork> nebmo88: its arrays can be an array, and a key: value pair
[05:51:34] <Cork> if its the later its an object in javascript, or hash in other languages
[05:51:52] <fRAiLtY-> Anyone know why this: http://pastie.org/4108150 select the row correctly, but not the column here: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing (click Price Matrix at the bottom tabs). The table HTML is here: http://pastebin.com/yP87qpe7
[05:51:53] <shoky> []
[05:52:18] <nebmo88> ah. so my proper question would be "how do I split an object that returns {"message":"Saved @ 18\/06\/12 @ 13:48:27","rdata_id":null} ?"
[05:52:20] <nebmo88> :)
[05:52:32] <Cork> nebmo88: have jquery handle it as json
[05:52:37] <Cork> that IS the answer
[05:53:02] <Cork> ?eval JSON.parse('{"message":"Saved @ 18\/06\/12 @ 13:48:27","rdata_id":null}').message
[05:53:03] <bot-t> Cork: "Saved @ 18/06/12 @ 13:48:27"
[05:53:10] <nebmo88> :S i replaced -> contentType: "application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=utf-8", <- for -> dataType: 'json', <-
[05:53:15] <chilversc_> codeAssassin: well chrome didn't complain :)
[05:53:29] <Cork> nebmo88: parse is what jquery does by default if you send the correct types
[05:53:33] <chilversc_> codeAssassin: but like I said, not really sure I like the solution
[05:53:44] <Cork> nebmo88: try setting the correct mime header from the server
[05:54:11] <Cork> nebmo88: header('Content-type: application/json');
[05:55:24] <chilversc_> codeAssassin: though this probably avoids the source undefined error, http://jsfiddle.net/BxA56/5/
[05:56:33] <bor> good day, could someone help here http://jsfiddle.net/Da8y9/8/ ?
[05:57:08] <bor> why ui are empty ?
[05:57:13] <bor> is it bug ?
[06:00:56] <codeAssassin> chilversc_: hmm i doubt that this is really cross browser compatible. I'm testing it in FF
[06:00:58] <codeAssassin> on a mac
[06:01:24] <Woet> bor: jsfiddle only loads javascript, if you want the jquery UI css too you can add it at 'add resources' at jsfiddle
[06:02:23] <nebmo88> okay so I've done in the php page -> header('Content-type: application/json');  echo json_encode($array); <- then in jquery -> success: function (html) { var array = jQuery.parseJSON(html; alert( array.message ); } <- but it still alerts the WHOLE object.
[06:03:07] <fuchstronaut> when animating the background color of an element (switching to red and back to white) all my other styles get lost
[06:03:12] <fuchstronaut> can i prevent that somehow?
[06:03:15] <bor> Woet: thanks, but the question was: why ui objet are empty in create option/event ?
[06:03:25] <Woet> bor: you mean the console.log?
[06:03:29] <bor> yes
[06:03:33] <Woet> bor: it's not empty?
[06:03:53] <bor> hm, but in my console it empty
[06:04:27] <bor> ff 10.0.5
[06:04:47] <Woet> what do you want to do with the ui variable?
[06:05:02] <bor> Woet: what browser you use ?
[06:05:07] <Woet> bor: chrome
[06:05:20] <bor> i'll recheck then in chromium
[06:06:09] <nebmo88> correction. it returns -> {"message":"Saved @ 18\/06\/12 @ 13:48:27","rdata_id":null} <- but this does not alert anything -> success: function (html) { var array = jQuery.parseJSON(html; alert( array.message ); } <-
[06:10:04] <hlvewentcrazy> Harro everyboday.
[06:19:32] <xec> oh hai thar hlvewentcrazy

[06:22:36] <johnline> $('#billy's-pizza-hut-party').fadeTo(black);
[06:22:40] <johnline> y this no working?
[06:24:20] <codeAssassin> johnline: http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
[06:24:24] <chilversc_> codeAssassin: yeah, I don't like it, but it does seem it is sort of possible
[06:24:25] <codeAssassin> johnline: look at the parameters
[06:25:04] <codeAssassin> chilversc_: if it fits your usecase, and it works in most popular browser. i'd say go for it
[06:25:43] <johnline> i need to come clean, i was trolling a bit :v
[06:25:57] <hlvewentcrazy> that's not nice :v
[06:26:42] <codeAssassin> johnline: dude
[06:27:01] <johnline> dooooode
[06:27:28] <hlvewentcrazy> it'd of been a better troll, and slightly more amusing if you did something like
[06:27:35] <hlvewentcrazy> $('#ACDC').fadeTo(black);
[06:27:38] <hlvewentcrazy> :>
[06:27:56] <codeAssassin> hlvewentcrazy: you sir, just made my day

[06:34:09] <_archer_> How do I DOM an object model of document type with jQuery?
[06:35:54] <FernandoBasso> Html source shows <option value='1' (and alsow '2' and '3'). but $('option[value]').val() always gets id=1. Any ideas?
[06:36:18] <codeAssassin> FernandoBasso: add :selected
[06:37:00] <FernandoBasso> codeAssassin: Great!!! Thanks.
[06:37:14] <codeAssassin> FernandoBasso: you're welcome
[06:38:33] <sacho> _archer_, how do you what?
[06:38:53] <_archer_> FernandoBasso - if you just want the selected value then you only need $("option").val()
[06:39:05] <_archer_> sacho - trolled... u mad? :p
[06:39:26] <sacho> ...what? :|
[06:39:41] <FernandoBasso> _archer_: Interesting. Thanks.
[06:40:00] <_archer_> sacho http://goo.gl/4T9qx
[06:40:23] <_archer_> FernandoBasso - no problem.  You can use val() for all input types
[06:40:29] <_archer_> (I *think*)
[06:40:54] <_archer_> and you can set it with $(element).val("value")
[06:45:55] <QueueQueue> Not ALL, but most.
[06:51:12] <track0x1> if i have a div that has several elements, and i want one button press to remove a class from every element in that div- how would i go about doing that?
[06:51:34] <track0x1> .children?
[06:52:04] <_archer_> track0x1 - $("#divID *").removeClass("className")
[06:52:20] <_archer_> track0x1 - That'll remove it from all the children and all their children etc..
[06:52:41] <track0x1> ah ok, sweet! now is that any different from using .children??
[06:52:52] <Swift1> hey guys
[06:53:11] <hlvewentcrazy> REMOVE ALL THE CHILDREN
[06:53:33] <track0x1> lol
[06:53:58] <Swift1> can somone give me a hand with a jquery project, im a jquery noob, so i dont have a clue how to do this
[06:54:20] <_archer_> track0x1 - .children().removeClass("className") will remove it from only the children
[06:54:27] <track0x1> that's fine
[06:54:28] <track0x1> i g2g
[06:54:30] <track0x1> thanks!!

[07:01:10] <duffo__> im adding rows to a table. events are not triggering. i fixed the datepicker input and its working. i got dropdowns that shows another input based on the value in the dropdown.. this works fine for the rows already made but not with the new rows.
[07:01:42] <merlin1991> granden: with the click event you get x and y post of the click
[07:02:47] <duffo__> im using .clone()
[07:04:47] <c0pp3rnick> how can I select, say 1st, 3rd, and 4th cell in a <tr>?
[07:05:02] <henn1nk> hmmm does someone know a jquery image gallery that scals to the full site with?
[07:05:06] <_archer_> duffo__ look at the parameters for clone() - you can tell it to clone event handlers as well
[07:05:11] <mink> c0pp3rnick, what you want to do? :)
[07:05:53] <novochar> how do you handle post requests?
[07:06:05] <c0pp3rnick> mink, I'm aware of :eq() selector, but I'd like to pass like an array to grab only certain elements
[07:06:45] <zoster> $.post(url, data, HANDLE, typeOfResult);
[07:06:50] <c0pp3rnick> mink, if <tr> has, say 5 <td>s, I'd like to select 1, 2 and 4

[07:07:24] <volk_> hey guys, i'm wondering if someone can help me wrap my head around writing a jquery plugin for a navigation menu. i'm more of backend so i'm trying to figure out how exactly i woudl go about making something like this
[07:07:44] <c0pp3rnick> _archer_, damn, I'm just reading it =)
[07:07:46] <c0pp3rnick> thanx
[07:07:47] <duffo__> _archer_, thanks ill take a look
[07:09:54] <tocka> Maybe it will sound like a silly question but I cant think of a search query for http://www.spillit.me/zoesimps0n (At the bottom load more answers function)

[07:12:23] <volk_> hey guys, i'm wondering if someone can help me wrap my head around writing a jquery plugin for a navigation menu. i have a good grasp of jquery but i jsut dont know where to begin to write a navigation plugin
[07:12:24] <Jon47> volk_: we're better about answering direct questions or things like "whats wrong with the code at this fiddle [link]", not so good about general approach type of questions, but if you want to try asking something we'll try answering it
[07:13:04] <volk_> thanks jon, i guess my main question is something alogn the lines fo
[07:13:05] <volk_> of*
[07:13:37] <volk_> what kind of mindset do i follow in terms of elements/divs so that i can use this menu anywhere
[07:13:53] <volk_> that sounds pretty general too haha..
[07:14:41] <volk_> what i mean is, do i make the menu have only 3 buttons, or do i have the menu consist of as many buttons as the user allows
[07:14:48] <volk_> in the options array that is passed when first creating the menu
[07:14:58] <volk_> also do i loop through the <li>'s
[07:15:04] <volk_> and <ul>'s
[07:15:30] <volk_> when building something like that
[07:15:42] <_archer_> volk_ why use jquery?  It's a lot easier to just use css for a navigation menu using UL
[07:16:07] <volk_> well mainly because the menu isn't just a pure menu, it also has ajax connected to PHP along with it
[07:16:13] <volk_> sorry a pure CSS menu**
[07:16:32] <volk_> it's for a private project, and i dont want to rewrite the same menu code across 100 pages
[07:16:46] <_archer_> Still only css is needed.  You build the ul/li structure with php & ajax but css does all the layout and hiding/showing
[07:18:27] <volk_> i mean i'm sure it's nice to do that with CSS, but i'm also trying to get better with jquery
[07:18:34] <fuchstronaut> (volk_): besides I'm pretty sure there is already a plugin for any kind of menu you think of, i think it is up to you how much configuration you leave to the user
[07:19:25] <volk_> alright guys, i realize all these things, but i'd love to build my own because i'm trying to get a good grasp of jquery. that's like telling an engineer that there are plenty of cars already built so why study mechanical engineering
[07:19:36] <_archer_> volk_ if you want to get better with jquery then do things that it's actually made for.  There's 0 reason to use it for the menu you've described other than the ajax call
[07:19:56] <_archer_> If you want to use a car analogy, it's like saying you want to learn how the engine works by taking the wheels off
[07:20:11] <fuchstronaut> (volk_): you are right, what was your question again?
[07:21:36] <volk_> thats fuch, my question lies in what kind of mindset to follow when building a navigation menu with ajax capabilities so that i can just call it simply with one line with some extra options passed to it
[07:21:39] <volk_> thanks fuch**
[07:22:05] <duffo__> .clone(true) was it that easy?!
[07:22:33] <fuchstronaut> now, i dont want to be nagging, but I think in general it is a good idea to seperate the ajax-part from the user interface
[07:22:38] <_archer_> duffo__ if it's objects that use events that you don't assign yourself, then yes.  If you do assign the events yourself then look at using .on()
[07:22:54] <volk_> i see, okay so assuming i separate the ajax part
[07:22:59] <fuchstronaut> but still you can make a JQ based navigation if you feel like CSS isnt doing it for you
[07:23:11] * hlvewentcrazy slaps fuchstronaut around a bit with a large trout
[07:23:25] * fuchstronaut ducks
[07:23:29] <fuchstronaut> why?!
[07:23:31] <fuchstronaut> just WHY?!
[07:23:52] * hlvewentcrazy ties a bow around the trout and hands it to fuchstronaut
[07:24:09] <hlvewentcrazy> :o)
[07:24:14] <fuchstronaut> i would never do that
[07:24:32] <fuchstronaut> im just trying to be nice and help someone here for once :p
[07:24:36] <hlvewentcrazy> you should, gifting trouts is an incredibly nice thing to do.
[07:24:40] <fuchstronaut> instead of doing work i would actually get paid for..
[07:24:52] <hlvewentcrazy> oh let's face it, you're getting paid regardless
[07:24:54] <hlvewentcrazy> lol
[07:25:01] <fuchstronaut> sadly im not :(
[07:25:05] <hlvewentcrazy> oh no? :(
[07:25:08] * hlvewentcrazy is salary.
[07:25:24] <hlvewentcrazy> i get taken advantage of on the regular.
[07:25:27] <fuchstronaut> no i get paid on a work-per-hour basis
[07:25:41] <hlvewentcrazy> Awh what the hell is that nonsense?
[07:25:43] <hlvewentcrazy> :|
[07:25:59] <fuchstronaut> well i can take a day off whenever i wantr
[07:26:04] <pangelovski> hi guys
[07:26:10] <fuchstronaut> im happy with that :p
[07:26:13] <hlvewentcrazy> fuchstronaut, that's always good :P
[07:28:50] <codeAssassin> hi pangelovski
[07:34:34] <greek> Hey guys. I have a <tr> that contains a couple checkboxes in its cells. I want to say "if checkbox 1 checked, uncheck 2 and 3" and similar for when 2 is checked and when 3 is checked (kinda like a radio button). What's the easiest way to do this?
[07:35:08] <greek> if tr.checkbox checked, uncheck all other checkboxes in this tr
[07:35:13] <hlvewentcrazy> lol
[07:36:10] <jakeblake> Ok this is going to sound pretty noobish but I never had to use it up until now ... how do I get the "this" value of a jquery object without having to attach an encapsuled event to it in which this refers to the jquery anchor ...
[07:36:23] <greek> $(this)
[07:36:49] <jakeblake> no, that's not what I need :). I need this, not $(this)
[07:37:21] <_archer_> jakeblake - do you mean $(this)[0]?
[07:37:24] <fuchstronaut> $(this).get(0)
[07:37:30] <fuchstronaut> oh well, i guess that is faster
[07:37:31] <_archer_> returns dom object, not jquery object
[07:37:49] <_archer_> fuchstronaut I doubt there's much in it
[07:38:09] <fuchstronaut> get() calls a method, [0] accesses a property, so i hoped it might be faster
[07:38:11] <fuchstronaut> :)
[07:38:31] <_archer_> Yeah, but I doubt he's doing it 30,000 times :p
[07:38:49] <_archer_> Anyway $(this)[0] looks cooler ;)
[07:39:10] <fuchstronaut> yea, the number of paranthesis is linear to the coolnesfactor
[07:39:14] <fuchstronaut> i second that
[07:39:32] <fuchstronaut> so whenever someone looks at your screen they can say "wow, thats just like in the matrix" :D
[07:41:04] <_archer_> lol - I don't even see the code any more.  I see blonde, brunette, redhead...
[07:41:20] <rajatarora> hello, How can i validate multiple email id in jquery?
[07:41:44] <hlvewentcrazy> rajatarora, google surely has a solution for you...
[07:41:48] <_archer_> rajatarora - do you already have a validation method?
[07:42:00] <hlvewentcrazy> Not to be a dick, but there are tons of email validation scripts already done...
[07:42:39] <fuchstronaut> make an array out of your emails (by using split or whatever), loop, match against regex found on google
[07:42:40] <rajatarora> can you point me to the one
[07:42:43] <fuchstronaut> thats what i would do
[07:42:54] <FernandoBasso> _archer_: Just out of curiosity, has your nick anything to do withy arch linux?
[07:43:07] <hlvewentcrazy> god I hope not
[07:43:09] <jakeblake> _archer_: thanks, that was it yeah ... I needed to get the offset value which you can only get through the DOM element, not the jquery object ofc
[07:43:10] <hlvewentcrazy> Linux is stupid.
[07:43:10] <fuchstronaut> it did, but than he took an arrow to the knee
[07:43:19] <_archer_> FernandoBasso - no, it's a software "house" name
[07:43:31] <FernandoBasso> hlvewentcrazy: Some people are also stupid.
[07:43:38] <rajatarora> okay i can make array of multiple email using spli, thanks for the quick sol
[07:43:41] <hlvewentcrazy> Agreed. Thank god I don't use linux.
[07:43:42] <fuchstronaut> yeah linux totally sux, im doing everything on my iPad
[07:44:04] <hlvewentcrazy> Idk. Linux isn't for me. I like to have fun on my computers.
[07:44:06] <geekbri> I'm using windows 3.11 for workgroups.
[07:44:43] <fuchstronaut> (hlvewentcrazy): have you ever wanted to automate a simple task that makes you do 10 clicks? at this point shellscripting comes in very handy
[07:44:44] <Lachezar> Hello all...
[07:44:59] <fuchstronaut> Hello Lachezar
[07:45:08] <_archer_> Hi Lachezar
[07:45:09] <Lachezar> I need to style the UL and LI items, but that breaks Autocomplete plugin's style. Please advise.
[07:45:14] <hlvewentcrazy> fuchstronaut, if I wanted to do something like that because I was *that* lazy... I'd create a macro.
[07:45:16] <hlvewentcrazy> Come on now.
[07:45:22] <NoiseEee> Lachezar: learn 2 css ?
[07:45:41] <jeffsmykil> Can anyone tell me why i cant get this widget to initialize?
[07:45:42] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/HEBF3/10/
[07:45:49] <jeffsmykil> can jsfiddle not do widgets?
[07:45:49] <Lachezar> NoiseEee: ??? Conflicting rules... :(
[07:45:59] <pangelovski> is it possible to apply a navbar theme to a navbar outside the page container?
[07:46:32] <Lachezar> NoiseEee: I would very much like to avoid rewriting the jQuery-UI Theme .CSS.
[07:46:36] <mzarella> i have a form that has a method of POST, is it possible to send the request with the $.post method?
[07:46:39] <codeAssassin> jeffsmykil: go to Add Resources and add the js file containing the function thing
[07:47:01] <codeAssassin> jeffsmykil: or in this case, the jQuery extension
[07:47:01] <jeffsmykil> codeAssassin: the function thing is already in the script section?
[07:47:21] <fuchstronaut> (hlvewentcrazy): I'm not trying to convice you, I can see why ppl use windows and Mac OS, but often these systems don't bring the comfort of linux
[07:47:46] <codeAssassin> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/HEBF3/11/
[07:47:59] <jeffsmykil> ah
[07:48:13] <codeAssassin> jeffsmykil: happened to me a bunch of times
[07:48:19] <jeffsmykil> codeAssassin: ty, I may have another question very shortly if you are game
[07:48:29] <codeAssassin> jeffsmykil: only if i know the answer
[07:48:30] <hlvewentcrazy> fuchstronaut: Once Steam finishes developing their Linux client and it works flawlessly with every videogame, I'm sure it will be a reasonable thing to try, but until then, lolscrewthat
[07:49:07] <Lachezar> hlvewentcrazy: Just having a Steam client for Linux will NOT be sufficient.
[07:49:26] <Lachezar> hlvewentcrazy: We will still need games to be ported to Linux.
[07:49:45] <mzarella> this is what i have and i'm wondering if it's valid: https://gist.github.com/55f9c815c666d61e9e1f
[07:49:46] <hlvewentcrazy> *and it works flawlessly with every videogame,*
[07:49:52] <hlvewentcrazy> i hate repeating myself, sir.
[07:49:53] <hlvewentcrazy> lol
[07:49:59] <fuchstronaut> Games will never be ported to linux, as they stopped to port for windows ;)
[07:50:16] <fuchstronaut> consoles are for games, computers for work and phones/tablets for private use
[07:50:18] <fuchstronaut> thats the future :P
[07:50:28] <hlvewentcrazy> lol screw that noise.
[07:50:40] <_archer_> mzarella - for one thing, you don't close the quotes on the first add command
[07:51:10] <mzarella> i have it closed in my code, i just didn't type it out properly this time
[07:51:23] <mzarella> changed
[07:52:12] <mzarella> i think this is a valid method for submitting posts
[07:52:18] <_archer_> mzarella - there's an extra end brace.  Other than that it's fine
[07:52:19] <mzarella> just wanting some feedback
[07:52:24] <mzarella> great
[07:52:43] <jeffsmykil> codeAssassin: The irony is none of these are my questions, I have to ask questions to get to the point where I can ask my question: http://jsfiddle.net/HEBF3/13/
[07:52:59] <jeffsmykil> codeAssassin: any idea why the setOption isn't firing
[07:56:22] <codeAssassin> jeffsmykil: you want to change the option values right ?
[07:56:35] <jeffsmykil> wait i figured that part out
[07:56:53] <jeffsmykil> ok now my real question codeAssassin
[07:57:03] <jeffsmykil> codeAssassin: it hits the setOption four times
[07:57:13] <jeffsmykil> with the same info
[07:57:23] <jeffsmykil> codeAssassin: how do i do this correctly
[07:59:02] <mzarella> for some reason the post method is being sent to the site that the user is looking at, i would like for it to be sent to another server
[07:59:09] <codeAssassin> jeffsmykil: workin on your prob
[07:59:25] <mzarella> _archer_: the code is valid, but it isn't doing what i would like for it to be doing
[07:59:48] <mzarella> i want to communicate with a different server, not the current server which the page is located on
[08:00:04] <sacho> !mdn
[08:00:07] <sacho> sadface
[08:02:10] <chilversc_> mzarella: if you want to send it to a different server, you'd just put a fully qualified url to the other server
[08:02:32] <Ojje> Hi there. Have a lot of selects on one page that i load with ajax. I need to add change events to them but i got "Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded". Tried to bind it to parent div instead of each select but still get the error. Any ideas? Using ').live("change"  and jquery 1.4
[08:02:53] <chilversc_> mzarella: but you wouldn't be able to get a response back normally, due to CORS security settings (cross origin resource sharing)
[08:05:34] <mzarella> chilversc_: how do you get a response back?
[08:05:50] <codeAssassin> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/HEBF3/15/
[08:05:56] <codeAssassin> jeffsmykil: getting close?
[08:06:15] <chilversc_> mzarella: you don't with out the server's co-operation, at which point you can look at either the new CORS related security stuff (browser support varies) or you can use JSONP
[08:06:59] <mzarella> what about easyxdm?
[08:07:09] <codeAssassin> jeffsmykil: i actually have to go. i have to ri
[08:07:18] <jeffsmykil> codeAssassin: I will examine it and then try to work it into my code tyvm
[08:07:23] <codeAssassin> *run for 30 minutes
[08:08:00] <codeAssassin> jeffsmykil: good luck! and remember to have fun
[08:08:05] <chilversc_> mzarella: sure, looks like it is also made to solve this same problem, I've never used it myself
[08:08:50] <jeffsmykil> codeAssassin: I too work at a .net house IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE FUN
[08:08:51] <chilversc_> mzarella: though it looks a bit more heavy weight than JSONP
[08:09:21] <codeAssassin> jeffsmykil: Quit! quit now before it consumes your soul
[08:09:48] <jeffsmykil> lol need more experience, no education in this stuff so I have to build my portfolio first
[08:10:19] <codeAssassin> ahh
[08:10:30] <codeAssassin> jeffsmykil: may the force be with you then
[08:10:36] <jeffsmykil> and also with you
[08:10:54] <_archer_> gay
[08:11:23] <jeffsmykil> i thnik you mean lame
[08:11:25] <jeffsmykil> or geeky
[08:11:33] <_archer_> I meant gar
[08:11:35] <jeffsmykil> not sure 'gay' has anything to do with it
[08:11:56] <chilversc_> jeffsmykil: that's probably more to do with the place than .net
[08:12:23] <jeffsmykil> I don't know chilversc working on a web app with a bunch of ,net guys...
[08:12:36] <_archer_> It's my misuse of the word "gay".  I don't mean what most people mean
[08:26:17] <mzarella> jsonp looks dangerous
[08:26:21] <lampe2> hey i wanne select a div and all the children nodes in the dom of this div for a hover how can i do that?
[08:27:06] <EyePulp> mzarella: dangerous in what regard?
[08:28:23] <mzarella> sending javascript commands to a server
[08:28:32] <mzarella> not just data
[08:29:44] <shoky> you dont send javascript to the server with jsonp
[08:29:58] <mzarella> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8834022/what-are-the-xss-dangers-of-passing-js-functions-in-json
[08:30:05] <mzarella> worries relieved
[08:49:03] <mzarella> how would you specify that on a click of a button, you would like a function to be ran?
[08:49:09] <mzarella> does this need to be jquery?
[08:49:50] <timing> function thefunction(){} $el.click(thefunction);
[08:49:57] <thang> mzarella: you could add onclick="myfunc()" in the html tag
[08:49:59] <thang> or that
[08:50:09] <fuchstronaut> dont do it in the tag
[08:50:17] <thang> whys that?
[08:50:20] <fuchstronaut> google for jsevents, or just go with jquery .click
[08:50:24] <timing> indeed, this is #jquery, not #html :-)
[08:50:26] <mzarella> $('someElement').onclick = ...
[08:50:28] <mzarella> something like that?
[08:50:33] <timing> nope
[08:50:34] <timing> .click()
[08:50:39] <timing> and read the jquery docs
[08:50:42] <fuchstronaut> (mzarella): check out the jquery docs search for click() there
[08:50:53] <timing> http://api.jquery.com/click/
[08:51:13] <fuchstronaut> (thang): it will work, but jscode should be seperated from HTML markup, thats why i said not to do so
[08:51:58] <thang> just curious.
[08:52:24] <fuchstronaut> well, it is problematic if it comes to changing/updating your code
[08:52:35] <fuchstronaut> and it is making it hard for searchengines
[08:52:41] <fuchstronaut> and it extends the markup and so on
[08:52:50] <fuchstronaut> further there are no benefits of inline events
[08:53:00] <fuchstronaut> so its just bad practice from 1995 ;-)
[08:53:17] <mzarella> do all browsers support event capturing?
[08:53:28] <fuchstronaut> (mzarella): yes, its part of javascriptstandard
[08:54:36] <mzarella> jquery uses evet listening with the .click method
[08:54:53] <mzarella> wrong win
[08:58:01] <_archer_> mzarella - jquery is only a wrapper for standard javascript methods.  It's made for cross-browser compatibility, so you don't have to worry about it any more (mostyl)
[08:58:12] <_archer_> *mostly*
[09:05:15] <johnline> $('.hovertext').hide().html($(this).data('name').text()).stop(true,true).fadeIn(400);
[09:05:30] <johnline> have i done this html5 data call correctly??
[09:05:57] <pachet> late to the party as usual, but
[09:06:06] <pachet> mzarella: no, not all browsers support the capture phase natively
[09:06:09] <pachet> namely ie<9
[09:06:18] <pachet> jquery abstracts this, as people said above
[09:06:24] <johnline> nvm guys, i fixed it by removing .text()
[09:08:24] <pachet> johnline: i wouldnt refer to it as a html5 data call
[09:09:03] <pachet> jquery does you the favor of enumerating properties on the matching data object for that element with data- attributes specified on the dom element
[09:09:29] <pachet> but thats not to say that there's a 1:1 correspondence between props on that jq object and data- attributes
[09:09:46] <pachet> technicality :[
[09:11:37] <thomedy> okay i have a huge question cuz i can run a setTimeout, i have done it  more than once and this particular one is very much working because i ran a test alert() function and it ran and then when i do it with out the set time out i get my .load but i put the load in the set time out and i get nothing
[09:12:08] <hlvewentcrazy> http://jsfiddle.net/CyGAg/ So I'm trying to take this and have it look for the li a element with 'Application 1', add a class, and wrap it in bold tags, what would be the best way to do that?
[09:12:13] <hlvewentcrazy> o_u
[09:12:17] <jeeky> hi
[09:12:25] <hlvewentcrazy> it's stupid simple I'm sure, but I'm drawing blanks
[09:12:54] <pachet> jeeky: hi
[09:12:58] <jeeky> what's the question?
[09:13:12] <hlvewentcrazy> jeeky http://jsfiddle.net/CyGAg/ So I'm trying to take this and have it look for the li a element with 'Application 1', add a class, and wrap it in bold tags, what would be the best way to do that? ^^
[09:13:44] <hlvewentcrazy> So in end, the tag would should look like <li class="Classname"><b>Application 1 </b></li>
[09:14:00] <thomedy> jeeky was that at me
[09:14:02] <thomedy> ?
[09:14:18] <shoky> hlve where did the <a> go
[09:14:39] <hlvewentcrazy> Ah, they would need to go too.
[09:15:21] <thomedy> hey shoky, i gots me a  question i have a .load() it works great.... i got a setTimeout it goes great too... but then i combine them i get my setTImeout but no load...
[09:15:23] <hlvewentcrazy> lol, hi btw shoky. How was your weekend?
[09:15:44] <shoky> hey. was ok;p
[09:15:58] <jeeky> hlvewentcrazy: Hang on, I think I got this
[09:16:26] <hlvewentcrazy> Before you tell me I need to know how to do simple things like this, I've gotten it to a point, I'm just trying to find a way to make it a function I can call from multiple pages easily as it's basically my 'current page' styling for my sidebar
[09:16:28] <hlvewentcrazy> lol
[09:16:42] <hlvewentcrazy> Maintainable code, I guess is my biggest problem :S
[09:17:14] <jeeky> hlvewentcrazy: Well the issue is that you're trying to find a link that has the specific text
[09:17:32] <jeeky> hlvewentcrazy: traversing in js is better by going through tag
[09:17:33] <pachet> hlvewentcrazy: http://jsfiddle.net/EDYXE/
[09:17:48] * hlvewentcrazy huggles pachet.
[09:17:48] <jeeky> pachet: contains, nice one
[09:18:21] <shoky> well since i also made one i might as well post: http://jsfiddle.net/CyGAg/1/
[09:19:14] <hlvewentcrazy> also, nice thank you shoky, pachet, and jeeky ;)
[09:19:16] <pachet> thomedy: can you make a fiddle demonstrating this
[09:19:36] <hlvewentcrazy> you are all awwwwwwesome. <:
[09:19:48] <hlvewentcrazy> shoky, get up to anything fancy this weekend, sir?
[09:19:48] <hlvewentcrazy> :P
[09:19:57] <shoky> thomedy: yea we cant help without more info.  setTimeout and .load() work fine
[09:20:09] <shoky> hlvewentcrazy: nothing at all :P what bout you?
[09:20:18] <thomedy> i made a fiddle but i dont know if i can run  a .load for cross site
[09:20:20] <thomedy> is that possible
[09:20:26] <thomedy> so i didnt' include the load
[09:20:29] <thomedy> and the load is the problem
[09:20:31] <shoky> oh, well i chipped my front tooth (again) and now look like a retard till i get it fixed
[09:21:07] <shoky> thomedy: so it wont run the load, post it anyway..
[09:21:15] <thomedy> okay i can do that
[09:21:21] <thomedy> i didnd't think it would help
[09:21:24] <thomedy> im on it
[09:21:40] <shoky> what did you think would help, then ;P
[09:21:54] <shoky> saying: im using X and Y and it doeznt work, definitely doesn't halp
[09:22:22] <hlvewentcrazy> shoky, sorry to hear!
[09:22:35] <shoky> hlve its ok ;>
[09:23:05] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/MMqcw/1/
[09:24:33] <thomedy> my click in the site is (div).live('click', function(){}) but again the load works fine as a live event
[09:24:53] <thomedy> its the setTImeout that throws me everytime
[09:25:06] <shoky> i dont see a problem with the code..
[09:25:13] <thomedy> but i dont get a load
[09:25:18] <thomedy> theres nothing
[09:25:18] <NoiseEee> twss
[09:26:11] <shoky> at least you abbreviated it
[09:26:18] <hlvewentcrazy> shoky, if it makes you feel any better (not sure why it out) i chipped mine at work a few months back and got a 'written warning' from the hr lady who hates me, because i ran to the dentist.
[09:26:22] <hlvewentcrazy> lol
[09:26:36] <shoky> hlve: lol.. i'd chip her teeth in
[09:26:45] <shoky> AND MURDER HER.
[09:26:46] <hlvewentcrazy> lol seriously. the woman HATES my guts
[09:27:32] <hlvewentcrazy> has something to do with me being half her age, I'm sure
[09:28:06] <hlvewentcrazy> shoky, I'll have you let you know once we get the site up so you can see what I've been working on lol.
[09:28:32] <shoky> so you'll tell me, and i'll notify myself?!
[09:28:34] <thomedy> i just freakin need this to work and then i can start ordering the details
[09:28:37] <shoky> weird, but, ok!
[09:28:53] <hlvewentcrazy> lol
[09:30:05] <pachet> thomedy: well, it looks fine in the fiddle. the most common culprit with settimeout is losing scope, so if you're trying to $(this).load(), that can cause problems if its deferred
[09:30:24] <pachet> s/deferred/put in a timeout callback
[09:30:47] <thomedy> im sorry what do you mean by deferred
[09:30:47] <_archer_> thomedy - what's the fiddle url?
[09:31:06] <pachet> thomedy: put in a timeout callback
[09:31:16] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/MMqcw/1/
[09:31:19] <_archer_> ta
[09:31:35] <volk_> archer, i get what you were saying before now
[09:31:38] <volk_> btw
[09:32:19] <_archer_> volk_ were you asking about navigation with php & ajax?
[09:32:25] <volk_> yea
[09:32:26] <volk_> yeah*
[09:32:47] <_archer_> Yeah, it's just easier to do the navigation layout and "fancy stuff" with css
[09:33:06] <volk_> yeah, i think i misunderstood you slightly, that's exactly the way i meant to do it in the first place
[09:33:57] <_archer_> Have you figured the ajax call then?  It should be a simple $("#ID").load(url)
[09:35:39] <DwarfSmasher> Hmm, when i get all the dom elements into the variable "var foo = $('.bar');" and then interate over them: " for ( var f in foo) { if( foo.hasOwnProtperty(f) { console.log(f) }}" it still logs "length", "prevObject", "context" and "selector"
[09:36:27] <DwarfSmasher> what am i doing wrong
[09:36:30] <track0x1> how can i set the contents of an input field via jquery?
[09:37:08] <DwarfSmasher> value
[09:37:22] <DwarfSmasher> to set content of input field
[09:38:15] <_archer_> thomedy - are you expecting that fiddle to populate the <p> with google?  There's 2 reasons it won't work, if that's what you're trying to do
[09:38:45] <thomedy> actually let me do this... instead here is my site
[09:38:49] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[09:38:56] <thomedy> that is the version im trying to create
[09:39:11] <thomedy> archer... this is in response to your question
[09:39:31] <thomedy> were you looking at my site or are you buys
[09:39:34] <thomedy> busy
[09:39:43] <track0x1> DwarfSmasher: but i cant use .val that only gets the value
[09:40:00] <_archer_> thomedy - I was looking at your fiddle, but happy to look at your site for a little while before I disappear.  So what's the problem so far?
[09:40:13] <thomedy> i would really appreciate it thank you
[09:40:25] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[09:40:36] <thomedy> click any link you want
[09:40:46] <thomedy> and tell me when you get to that
[09:41:08] <zoster> Metallica - I Disappear
[09:42:13] <DwarfSmasher> anyone can point me out why am i getting inheritence from prototype when i iterate over object while using hasOwnProperty?
[09:42:35] <DwarfSmasher> oh thanks track
[09:42:39] <DwarfSmasher> missed your response
[09:43:41] <_archer_> thomedy - I guess you want to get the content specified by the link href and load it into the next ".injection-container" div?
[09:43:49] <thomedy> yea
[09:44:09] <thomedy> right now the only time it will load is if you click the link with the parent() == .alternate
[09:44:14] <thomedy> and that is the one in the top left corner
[09:44:19] <_archer_> okay - that seems pretty straight-forward.  Just bear with me one minute
[09:44:22] <thomedy> that same link runs an alert as a test
[09:44:29] <DwarfSmasher> oh wait you were talking about other thing :), http://api.jquery.com/val/
[09:44:36] <thomedy> okay if you can fix me i will love you but then you have to explain why im dumb
[09:47:40] <_archer_> thomedy - do any of them have content?
[09:47:52] <_archer_> I *think* it's working, but need to see a result to be sure
[09:47:54] <thomedy> some i just have the wrong links right now
[09:47:56] <shoky> thomedy: pachet already told you
[09:48:04] <shoky> thomedy: you're using $(this)
[09:48:11] <shoky> inside setTimeout ..
[09:48:19] <shoky> what do you think $(this) is?
[09:48:35] <zoster> yea :D
[09:48:36] <_archer_> shoky - he can get rid of lots of his code and replace it with a few simple lines
[09:48:41] <zoster> good point made by shoky
[09:48:55] <thomedy> when i console.log ia this it gives me the whole page but when i use it without sett ime out it works so i thought it was the element i clicked
[09:48:57] <shoky> & pachet ;p
[09:49:14] <shoky> thomedy: you should never guess
[09:49:19] <shoky> in coding.
[09:49:20] <thomedy> too late
[09:49:24] <shoky> is it
[09:49:34] <thomedy> i already guessed
[09:49:42] <shoky> in the past
[09:49:47] <shoky> that's done with
[09:50:23] <_archer_> thomedy - can you give me a link to something relevant to populate with, just for me to test?  I can't tell if it's working correctly if there's no data returned
[09:50:43] <thomedy> yeah one sec
[09:50:46] <_archer_> k
[09:51:40] <thomedy> ?q=menswear
[09:51:43] <bot-t> thomedy, Couldn't find "q=menswear" in jQuery Docs.
[09:51:54] <_archer_> ta
[09:52:00] <thomedy> is that the question
[09:52:33] <shoky> thomedy:  var $this = $(this); setTimeout(function() { $('.bla').load( $this.attr('href') ); }, 6000);
[09:53:03] <thomedy> thank you and im googling the this object right now
[09:53:11] <thomedy> so im not just making people do my work for me
[09:53:18] <thomedy> i just want to learn as fast as possible thank you
[09:53:29] <shoky> np
[09:55:31] <thomedy> oh your so awesome... that fixed it
[09:55:44] <thomedy> im on the this knowledge but that fixed it and im good
[09:55:46] <thomedy> thank you everyone
[09:56:17] <thomedy> im going to finish learning about this object and writing a jquery plugin and then im going to spen sometime with my kids / wife and get a  nap i have job 2 in a couple hours
[09:56:34] <pachet> 'this', in simplified terms, refers to the current execution context
[09:56:58] <pachet> more technically, its the resolved environment record for the function being evaluated
[09:57:27] <thomedy> in my head i have it as the current object like in a class...
[09:57:28] <pachet> but to your case, 'this' in a setTimeout callback resolves to the global object
[09:57:43] <thomedy> yeah thats what i was getting why is it different in this context
[10:00:54] <DBhangui> i have a question
[10:01:02] <DBhangui> anyone there?
[10:01:05] <pachet> ask and you shall maybe receive
[10:01:10] <DBhangui> okay
[10:01:28] <DBhangui> i am trying to make one of my jquery code automated
[10:01:39] <DBhangui> just give me a sec and ill set up a js fiddle
[10:02:17] <pachet> ok
[10:03:29] <DBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/jSNzP/embedded/result/
[10:03:35] <DBhangui> here is teh full screen result
[10:03:41] <DBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/jSNzP/
[10:03:44] <DBhangui> here is the code
[10:03:53] <DBhangui> for some reason in the code view it doesnt show up properly
[10:03:55] <DBhangui> but anyways
[10:03:59] <DBhangui> what i am trying to do
[10:04:01] <DBhangui> is
[10:04:43] <DBhangui> if you look in the js section I have this code where theline reads: angle = (numCategories - 1)*(180/numCategories) - angleStart;
[10:04:47] <DBhangui> for example
[10:04:51] <DBhangui> how can I make it
[10:04:52] <DBhangui> so thate
[10:05:00] <DBhangui> each time i terate through the function
[10:05:16] <DBhangui> or go throught it I can in crease that number "1" from 1 to 2
[10:05:24] <DBhangui> and then 3 each time the chain function executes
[10:06:09] <DBhangui> did i lose you packet?
[10:06:13] <DBhangui> *pachet
[10:06:24] <pachet> no, im still here

[10:22:59] <pachet> DBhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/fkJ2N/
[10:23:09] <pachet> i didnt really change that much, just removed the nested callbacks
[10:23:27] <christo_m> Hi, im doing a select box change, if "weekly" is the value selected, i do something like $('div.checkbox input').attr('checked', true); and false otherwise, now the check boxes have change events bound to them
[10:23:31] <christo_m> but doing an attr change like that doesn't evoke them
[10:24:25] <DBhangui> pachet tell me if i am reading this corectly
[10:24:27] <shoky> christo_m: so you want a change event
[10:24:36] <shoky> christo_m: you can trigger one
[10:24:45] <DBhangui> you removed the multiple lines of code that hide all category items
[10:25:07] <christo_m> shoky: can i fire them on all with like $('div.checkbox input').change() ?
[10:25:20] <shoky> christo_m: ye
[10:25:40] <DBhangui> what does the is.animating thing do?
[10:25:51] <DBhangui> *is_animating
[10:26:15] <pachet> just prevents you from clicking the button multiple times before the cycle completes
[10:26:16] <christo_m> shoky: that worked perfectly, thanks
[10:26:33] <shoky> christo_m: np. you answered yourself ;p
[10:26:55] <christo_m> shoky: im just used to only using .change() with a callback
[10:27:15] <shoky> christo_m: .change() is just a shortcut for .trigger('change')
[10:27:25] <christo_m> shoky: i figured

[10:49:40] <zoster> what's bothering you?
[10:50:43] <Hippie_> not much
[10:50:45] <Hippie_> haha
[10:51:16] <zoster> boli te kurac, uzivas :D
[10:52:31] <Hippie_> :?
[10:53:15] <zoster> it's a bosnian sleng
[10:53:45] <Hippie_> haha okay

[10:53:56] <zoster> :D
[11:39:26] <LordThumper> Hey.
[11:39:42] <zoster> hey.
[11:39:52] <LordThumper> I am using jQuery UI Accordion. Is it possible to use an accordion item as a link to another page?
[11:40:08] <zoster> YOU MIGHT
[11:40:11] <zoster> somehow override it
[11:43:13] <LordThumper> Guess it doesn't support that functionality by default
[11:45:01] <rroelofs> LordThumper: do you mean one of the headers, or one of the items inside an accordion section?
[11:45:19] <LordThumper> Yes one of the headers
[11:45:52] <rroelofs> Do you want it to open that section _and_go to the other page?
[11:46:01] <LordThumper> No, just open another page
[11:46:06] <diverdude> when doing $.ajax, what is the difference between using: dataType: "json", and dataType: "text" ? If i from my server send a json response i can on the client parse it with jQuery.parseJSON() if i set dataType: "text", but if i set dataType: "json", then jQuery.parseJSON() returns null. I find this quite strange. Am I missing something?
[11:46:43] <rroelofs> LordThumper: after the accordion setup, add a click event to that header and add stopPropogation() in the click handler
[11:47:49] <LordThumper> I see, it seems abit hacky but if its the only way
[11:47:51] <LordThumper> Thanks
[11:49:07] <QueueQueue> @diverdude When you look at the response before passing it to parseJSON, does it contain a JSON string or is it completely null?
[11:49:55] <diverdude> QueueQueue: when i look in firebug in response, it contain this: {"Result":{"AutosaveSender":{"id":"90","profile_id":"1","created":"2012-06-18 20:42:33","modified":"2012-06-18 20:42:33","subject":"","body":"","messageconversationthread_id":null,"isresponse":null},"Profile":[{"id":"2","username":"y28YMkGL[Nk]","MessagedraftsProfile":{"id":"93","messagedraft_id":"90","profile_id":"2"}}]}}
[11:52:28] <diverdude> QueueQueue: ahhh its already parsed
[11:52:33] <QueueQueue> yeah
[11:52:36] <QueueQueue> was just typing that lol
[11:53:28] <QueueQueue> But glad you were able to figure it out on your own! :)
[11:59:34] <bradmaxs> Trying to parse this json response in jquery but can't seem to figure out the correct layout of the json.  http://jsfiddle.net/468tN/  I want to get the Winery.name  Was trying data.Destination[0].Winery.id

[12:00:29] <danheberden> whateverYOuNamedIt.data.Destination[0].id
[12:00:51] <danheberden> oh the or Winery.id
[12:00:56] <danheberden> since you have two ide's
[12:00:59] <danheberden> *id's

[12:07:44] <zackiv31> anyone use jqZoom or know of a plugin that I can unbind/alter/rebind?
[12:08:30] <diverdude> QueueQueue: if i want to sent a js-object from client to server i need to do following in $.ajax if i need to make sure that all types etc are properly converted?  data: jQuery.parseJSON(myobj)
[12:09:29] <NoiseEee> diverdude: just supply dataType:'json' as an option in your request
[12:09:55] <bradmaxs> danheberden: it worked! thank you.
[12:10:56] <diverdude> NoiseEee: ok...but then problem is that null fields are being interpreted as 'null' (a string)
[12:12:01] <diverdude> NoiseEee: how do i avoid that?
[12:13:03] <diverdude> NoiseEee: how do i ensure that null is null and not 'null'
[12:14:28] <adz_> Hi. I am building a RESTFUL API in php. When I make a call too myAPI/validate I want it to throw a 400 error and an array of error codes/messages describing why the validation failed. How do I use jQuery to read the response?
[12:14:41] <adz_> I tried using .ajaxError but I can't access the response body
[12:15:58] <adz__>  Hi. I am building a RESTFUL API in php. When I make a call too myAPI/validate I want it to throw a 400 error and an array of error codes/messages describing why the validation failed. How do I use jQuery to read the response?
[12:16:20] <QueueQueue> @adz, serialize the array in your php code to json and parse the response into a JS object with $.parseJSON
[12:16:38] <diverdude> QueueQueue: : how do i ensure that null is null and not 'null' when sending from client to server?
[12:17:15] <adz__> QueueQueue: right, but which variable do I read? for example with a success I would have function(response) { do whatever }. what would I do for error
[12:17:50] <adz__> it returns function(event, jqXHR, ajaxSettings, thrownError){ none of which have what I returned
[12:18:12] <QueueQueue> Is your request for validation being made via ajax?
[12:18:18] <adz__> yes
[12:18:47] <adz__> and I get back a json response with an array of errors and a 400 error code
[12:19:18] <bradmaxs> danheberden: maybe not. Here is my each() statement and the array of json.  I am still getting a Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined
[12:19:19] <QueueQueue> So, you have the object containing all your errors on the JS side?
[12:19:32] <bradmaxs> danheberden: http://jsfiddle.net/468tN/5/
[12:19:48] <adz__> QueueQueue: well it's in the response. just trying to figure out how to get to that response from .ajaxError
[12:20:59] <adz__> QueueQueue: when I look in the Response tab in Chrome I see the JSON, but ajaxError doesn't seem to have access to it
[12:21:35] <diverdude> QueueQueue: ?
[12:21:40] <Innocentus> There is a page on which a javascript regulary checks something by requesting the server
[12:22:01] <Innocentus> now there can be also users without javascript support - however - I have to support them, too
[12:22:10] <Innocentus> for them a meta-tag is used which refreshes the whole page
[12:22:21] <Innocentus> but for the javascript users I don't want to use meta tag
[12:22:32] <Innocentus> can a meta tag be disabled by javascript (jquery)?
[12:22:43] <Innocentus> especially a meta redirect tag?
[12:24:29] <QueueQueue> @adz__ when set up your ajax call, you can set up your success, and error results. For error you'll have error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) where textStatus and errorThrown are details about the error
[12:29:50] <diverdude> how do i see the request sent from the client in firebug?
[12:31:08] <BFranks> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Button explains how to apply the 'button' class to all 'button' objects.. If I want to have it only on a button object with class="foo" what's the syntax?  (I know this sounds basic, I am a noob)
[12:32:16] <QueueQueue> @diverdude, look at the post tab when inspecting the request in firebug
[12:32:28] <danheberden> BFranks: you mean only make items with class .foo a button?
[12:32:58] <danheberden> e.g. $('button.foo').button()
[12:33:19] <BFranks> danheberden: yes.. so I can have a non 'jquery' button beside a normal one.. ;)
[12:33:22] <BFranks> Thanks :)
[12:33:33] <danheberden> ?selectors @ BFranks
[12:33:33] <bot-t> BFranks, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 13, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[12:34:10] <diverdude> QueueQueue: there is no post tab
[12:34:57] <QueueQueue> @diverdude you're referring to the request you're sending to the server ? Or the one you're receiving?
[12:35:18] <diverdude> QueueQueue: the one im sending to the server
[12:37:18] <QueueQueue> Are you sure you're clicking on the correct request?
[12:39:01] <tomasm-> hi, if i have a keypress() handler and a change() handler (both the same function) to deal with someone typing in an input field, whats the best way to prevent the change handler from firing if the onkeypress handler already did? since the events are different, I cant stop the propagation, etc. the only thing I can think of is to store the value in a data key and then skip the onchange handler if the data value matches the current value
[12:40:06] <danheberden> tomasm-: i would define those handlers in a closure and have a scoped var hold that information
[12:40:46] <danheberden> maybe keep it an int so you can keep track of how many times?
[12:40:48] <tomasm-> danheberden, what's a closure? and how do I tell one trigger of the event from a totally different one, ie 10 seconds later?
[12:41:19] <danheberden> like on the first change ignore it, increment, then if it's > 1 reset it to 0 and run teh codes
[12:41:24] <tomasm-> yeah I figured having a data('value') set to the value of the field, so if the event has already been handled, they will match - and no need to fire
[12:42:06] <diverdude> how do i send js object to the server, ensuring that null is null and not "null" when reaching the server?
[12:42:33] <tomasm-> diverdude, I would love to know that myself
[12:43:24] <diverdude> tomasm-: you also have that issue?
[12:43:57] <tomasm-> diverdude, i've had problems where sending null values via json/ajax converts it to the string "null"
[12:45:03] <diverdude> tomasm-: yeah me too...its so annoying...what language is your backend?
[12:45:33] <tomasm-> diverdude, php
[12:45:50] <danheberden> tomasm-: https://gist.github.com/da1076c5782a02f7c130
[12:46:05] <danheberden> should give you some info to work something out anyway
[12:47:16] <MeXTuX> I have a table with id="myTable". Is it possible to add one row to it to insert table headers <tr><th>HEADER1</th><th>HEADER2</th></tr>?
[12:47:47] <diverdude> tomasm-: mine too
[12:47:55] <NoiseEee> MeXTuX: table headers should be in a <thead>
[12:48:10] <diverdude> tomasm-: you struggling with that prob now?
[12:48:17] <danheberden> diverdude: if you have a properly encoded json string
[12:48:19] <tomasm-> diverdude, it's an issue on the js end, I think how ti creates the query string (on GET) and not sure about POST.....
[12:48:24] <danheberden> and use json_decode you will get null
[12:48:52] <danheberden> diverdude: http://danheberden.com/share/8bec92.png
[12:49:01] <tomasm-> danheberden, he's saying the data passed to the backend looks like "var1=val1&var2=null&var3=null&var4=val4", which any backend will interpret as strings "null", not empty strings
[12:49:08] <danheberden> that's not json
[12:49:12] <danheberden> just send json
[12:49:43] <danheberden> $.ajax({url: 'whatever', data: { omgJsonYay: JSON.stringify( myObjectOrWhatver) } });
[12:49:45] <NoiseEee> quite frankly, if the value is null, jquery won't even bother sending the key
[12:49:46] <tomasm-> danheberden, no I mean the underlying request GET/POST gets translated to.... of course that's not json
[12:50:07] <NoiseEee> diverdude: are you talking about the RESPONSE you are getting, or your REQUEST?
[12:50:09] <danheberden> and then json_decode( $_REQUEST['omgJsonYay'] );
[12:51:22] <danheberden> and if you need to get a form as that object, you can use https://github.com/danheberden/serializeObject
[12:51:27] <NoiseEee> diverdude: because like i said, jquery drops the key/value pair when the value is null
[12:51:38] <danheberden> er, *object as that form data
[12:52:02] <tomasm-> diverdude, I don't have the issue now, so I'm not sure about why/when/where I get that problem
[12:52:11] <tomasm-> just that it took me several hours to diagnose
[12:52:42] <diverdude> it seems the client sends this: %5Bisresponse%5D=null
[12:53:33] <tomasm-> diverdude, what jquery method are you using? $.post ? $.load ? $.get ? $.ajax?
[12:53:51] <diverdude> tomasm-: $.ajax
[12:54:00] <diverdude> tomasm-: and datatype:"json"
[12:54:19] <tomasm-> diverdude, and what is the data being sent? is it serialized somehow?
[12:54:58] <tomasm-> I use a custom version of serializeObject(), since serialize() normally just creates a query string from what I can tell
[12:55:03] <tomasm-> for the form data
[12:55:53] <tomasm-> my guess is my serializeObject() will pass null valued items
[12:55:58] <diverdude> tomasm-: what custom version?
[12:57:05] <tomasm-> diverdude, it's just a custom function I made, takes serializeArray() and converts it to a json object
[12:57:36] <NoiseEee> diverdude: pastebin your xhr call.
[12:57:58] <danheberden> i would bet serializeArray wouldn't keep null
[12:58:02] <diverdude> NoiseEee: you mean cpy it from firebug?
[12:58:11] <NoiseEee> diverdude: no, i mean your code.
[12:59:11] <diverdude> NoiseEee: this is it http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1232556686
[12:59:29] <NoiseEee> diverdude: well what is currentdraftmail
[12:59:30] <tomasm-> diverdude, yes but what is currentdraftmail ?
[12:59:33] <Innocentus> A page should regulary check for a result of some task running on the server
[12:59:40] <Innocentus> what would be the best way?
[12:59:44] <Innocentus> A simple pull?
[13:00:02] <Innocentus> What about a push? Is it supported and recommandable?
[13:00:13] <danheberden> Innocentus: either a check everyone and a while or just use something like socket.io
[13:00:29] <danheberden> or check/long-polling/websockets/whatever
[13:00:34] <tomasm-> Innocentus, depends on how frequent you need it to be.... push involves web sockets, ie socket.io, but that's limited by browser
[13:00:34] <Innocentus> ah yes
[13:00:38] <danheberden> depends if you need the notice to be real time
[13:00:56] <Innocentus> well, when there is a delay of 3 seconds or so this won't be cruel
[13:01:32] <tomasm-> if it's every 3 seconds I would think using sockets would be better.... especially if there's going to be multiple users online simultaneously
[13:01:45] <diverdude> NoiseEee: thats the object i want to transfer..hmmm moment i will try and show you the object
[13:02:36] <NoiseEee> diverdude: so however you are making that object, it is you specifying a string of null.
[13:03:08] <tomasm-> Innocentus, your real problem will be on the backend.... if it's PHP, it's not meant to be called that frequently, the server will easily get hosed.... unless you switch to something like node.js
[13:03:55] <Innocentus> when it is called and php doesn't timeout
[13:04:03] <Innocentus> then we get a constant link? or will the isp cut it
[13:04:39] <tomasm-> Innocentus, php terminates after the response is sent back.... unless you use some sort of server-side websockets  implementation.... it's apache itself thats the problem
[13:04:54] <tomasm-> apache doesn't do persistent sockets
[13:05:17] <diverdude> NoiseEee: here is screendump from firefox of the object: http://imagebin.org/216965
[13:05:36] <diverdude> NoiseEee: thats right before i send that object
[13:05:48] <diverdude> NoiseEee: (printed in chromw browser)
[13:06:09] <NoiseEee> diverdude: and when you var_dump($_POST['currentdraftmail']); in PHP whats your output?
[13:06:34] <NoiseEee> diverdude: because as mentioned, http://danheberden.com/share/8bec92.png
[13:06:44] <diverdude> NoiseEee: moment is try
[13:07:23] <LukeNukem> hi
[13:08:29] <LukeNukem> I'm trying to detect if a given parameter is a jquery instance or if it is a dom-object, but I can't seem to fund out how. does anyone know how?
[13:10:40] <tomasm-> I'm looking in the code for $.ajax() and the data is converted to a query string, no matter what, even if it's a POST (though kept separate from the url), and it calls $.param(), which does NOT filter out null values..... where is that supposedly being done?
[13:10:56] <tomasm-> so any instance of null values will convert to the string "null"
[13:10:58] <Innocentus> alright, thank you
[13:11:26] <tomasm-> Innocentus, if you really need that frequency, node.js is the way to go... it's in JS, too
[13:11:35] <tomasm-> server-side web server
[13:12:02] <NoiseEee> tomasm-: try yourself:  data:{val1:'something',val2:null}  in an .ajax post, you will NOT receive val2 on the backend
[13:12:59] <tomasm-> danheberden, where do you say it strips out null key/value pairs? I'm looking at the source code for jquery and don't see that
[13:13:25] <tomasm-> ok will try
[13:14:13] <tash> if the id of my dropdown it "dropdown" shouldn't this work? $("#dropdown").select( function() { console.log("test"); }); and thus log "test" to the console each time I select a value from the dropdown?
[13:14:23] <diverdude> NoiseEee: this is the output of var_dump($_POST); http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1327981947
[13:14:36] <danheberden> tomasm-: it was a hunch
[13:17:16] <NoiseEee> diverdude: try:  data:json.stringify(currentdraftmail)  and json_decode it on the php end, you should get a proper null
[13:17:30] <jeffsmykil> I have a ajax call I have to make inside a private function in a jquery widget, im having issues getting the options to go into the callback.... anyone tried this before?
[13:17:31] <NoiseEee> s/json/JSON/
[13:20:06] <diverdude> NoiseEee: Uncaught ReferenceError: json is not defined
[13:20:09] <tomasm-> NoiseEee, this is what I get with this call: j.ajax("/products/test/nulljson", { type: 'POST', data: data, success: function(response) { console.log(response); }} );
[13:20:13] <diverdude> oh sry
[13:20:16] <tomasm-> Array ( [url] => products/test/nulljson [val1] => one [val2] => null )
[13:20:17] <diverdude> you corrected
[13:22:08] <NoiseEee> tomasm-: hmmm i think you are correct :\
[13:22:41] <Luke23ae> ok, sorry if I repost, but I'm not sure if I even posted this - I was using a name that was already registered. So: I'm getting a jQuery instance as parameter and I want to check if a specific element is part of the instance's collection. (how) is that possible?
[13:23:37] <diverdude> NoiseEee: that just gives: array(0)
[13:23:40] <tomasm-> NoiseEee, there are no checks in jquery-1.7.1.js for "=== null"
[13:24:59] <Luke23ae> ah, it's http://api.jquery.com/index/
[13:26:32] <tomasm-> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8653 # Seemsl ike it'll be fixed in 1.8
[13:26:43] <diverdude> tomasm-: its a jquery bug?
[13:26:55] <diverdude> tomasm-: that causes the null=>"null" ?
[13:27:17] <tomasm-> diverdude, not a "bug" per se, just an omission of some sensible logic... javascript is at fault
[13:28:26] <diverdude> tomasm-: hmmm so its actually not possible to send null in jquery?
[13:28:46] <tomasm-> diverdude, I would probably create a wrapper function to clean up the object in the meantime..... i think what you want is null to be converted to the empty string
[13:29:27] <DwarfSmasher> Why when i get all the dom elements into the variable "var foo = $('.bar');" and then interate over them: " for ( var f in foo) { if( foo.hasOwnProtperty(f) { console.log(f) }}" it still logs "length", "prevObject", "context" and "selector"?
[13:29:27] <diverdude> tomasm-: well no because integers can also be null
[13:29:37] <diverdude> tomasm-: strings as well as integers can be null
[13:30:21] <shoky> ?.is @ Luke23ae
[13:30:22] <bot-t> Luke23ae, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[13:30:23] <tomasm-> diverdude, why does that make a difference? Either way, php treats them the same.... unless you allow null values in mysql
[13:30:24] <diverdude> tomasm-: did you find a bugreport on this issue?
[13:30:34] <tomasm-> diverdude, yeah I just posted that link
[13:31:42] <diverdude> when will 1.8 be out
[13:31:56] <tomasm-> heck if I know, I don't see a date anywhere
[13:32:13] <Luke23ae> shoky: index was exactly what I was looking for. I can't match against a selector. i need to match against an element
[13:32:16] <Luke23ae> thanks though
[13:32:24] <shoky> Luke23ae: .is does that
[13:32:35] <Luke23ae> oh
[13:32:36] <Luke23ae> ok
[13:32:37] <Luke23ae> well
[13:32:50] <Luke23ae> ah
[13:32:51] <imsky> i told you
[13:32:53] <Luke23ae> thanks!
[13:32:54] <karl_heinz> $("#formID").validationEngine('detach'); -- Given this, how can I do this for all forms on the page?
[13:33:19] <karl_heinz> I saw examples using each that passed a function in, but wasn't clear
[13:34:09] <shoky> karl_heinz: if the plugin does it by itself you can just do $('form').validationEngine('detach')
[13:34:31] <shoky> karl_heinz: and if not, $('form').each(function() { $(this).validationEngine('detach') })
[13:35:20] <karl_heinz> ah ok, the this keyword. and yeah you're probably right about the first statement too, never considered that

[15:10:50] <KWhat_Work> Do change events get thrown up the dom?  If i am listening for changes on a div that contains an element that produces a change event will i get that event?
[15:10:51] <otherj> DBhangui: why wouldn't you just try to improve js?
[15:10:51] <lurraca> this will get me only the same element 3 times
[15:11:12] <macmartine> Can anyone recommend any particular method/plugin for allowing drag and drop between tables?
[15:11:17] <gnarf> lurraca: the each takes index, value as paraqms
[15:11:36] <gnarf> so make it function( i, v ) { ... v.name ... }

[15:16:37] <KWhat_Work> wow
[15:16:43] <KWhat_Work> seriously ?
[15:17:05] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by "thrown up the DOM"?
[15:17:19] <danheberden> KWhat_Work: lol, I WAS BEING SILLY
[15:18:02] <KWhat_Work> I have a change listener on a div that contains a textbox, I am try to debug why I am getting 2 chagne events, one for the div and one for the text box.  I should only be getting one for the div
[15:18:42] <danheberden> i would search for "bubble" or "bubbling" in that jqfundamentals link
[15:18:49] <danheberden> "seriously."
[15:19:30] <otherj> hey shoky, would anything here preclude me from putting the template in a div like i did rather than a tr? i can't think of any reason for this to be broken
[15:19:31] <otherj> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.fileupload-ui.js#L521
[15:20:42] <shoky> otherj sorry i donno jq templates stuff
[15:21:10] <Shubuntu> can anyone help me with this please: http://pastebin.com/gU3ifBcZ
[15:21:54] <otherj> i don't think it's templating per-se
[15:22:01] <otherj> that part actually works
[15:22:12] <otherj> it's the way, maybe, that the plugin interacts with what it's outputting
[15:22:17] <shoky> otherj: it'd be much easier if you make a fiddle demonstrating your issue
[15:22:33] <krazyj> why did i have to document.getElementById to fix the error that the object doesn't have 'getAttribute'??
[15:22:35] <krazyj> :(
[15:22:39] <otherj> i'm not sure if that's actuallty possible here
[15:22:41] <krazyj> i was correctly selecting the input
[15:22:42] <otherj> relies on json backend
[15:22:54] <krazyj> (i.e. .val("i work") well, worked)
[15:22:54] <danheberden> krazyj: 'getAttribute' is a DOM element function
[15:22:55] <shoky> otherj: you can put some dummy json..
[15:22:59] <krazyj> danheberden: what does that mean
[15:23:01] <danheberden> if you were using jQuery, you'd want to use .attr()
[15:23:10] <otherj> well, might take me a while to get it up
[15:23:11] <otherj> i'll try
[15:23:12] <bzitzow> I am searching for a tutorial on positioning the JQuery UI form elements.
[15:23:16] <danheberden> $('#someElement') is not the same as document.getElementById('#someElement')
[15:23:23] <danheberden> $('#someElement') is a jQuery object
[15:23:25] <bzitzow> I'm trying to right align the elements of the form
[15:23:45] <danheberden> you could do $('#someElement').get(0) or $('#someElement')[0]
[15:23:52] <bzitzow> Would love any suggestions or a nudge in the right direction.
[15:23:57] <danheberden> to get the DOM element out of the jQuery collection to use getAttribute - but better to just use .attr()
[15:24:00] <otherj> bzitzow: just use css?
[15:24:02] <danheberden> ?attr @ krazyj
[15:24:02] <bot-t> krazyj, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[15:24:03] <shoky> otherj: remember, make the fiddle minimal, only what's needed to show the specific issue you're asking about
[15:24:09] <krazyj> danheberden: ah ok… thank you
[15:24:14] <danheberden> also, see ?prop @krazyj
[15:24:14] <bot-t> also, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[15:24:23] <otherj> shoky: roger. i'm not sure how to give jsfiddle dummy json, but i'm looking at it
[15:24:32] <shoky> otherj: if it's not related to templates, dont put templates. if its not related to json data from the server, dont put any
[15:24:36] <shoky> etc.
[15:24:45] <shoky> otherj: you dont need to give it dummy json
[15:24:55] <shoky> otherj: var myObj = {hi: 'lol'}
[15:24:59] <bzitzow> otherj: yeah, do I need to override all the default CSS? Or can I do by applying CSS to the <li> elements that each select, input, and radio is being rendered inside of?
[15:25:23] <otherj> hm, k
[15:25:30] <bzitzow> otherj: do I need to study the JQuery UI CSS Framework?
[15:25:49] <krazyj> danheberden: any idea why, when i try getScript(), i get undefined methods after `google.maps` for this script: http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false&libraries=places
[15:26:01] <krazyj> danheberden: i.e. google.maps.places should work/be loaded
[15:26:03] <krazyj> but its not
[15:26:05] <krazyj> when i use getScript
[15:26:22] <krazyj> solution is to insert a vanilla HTML js inclue
[15:26:36] <otherj> bzitzow: unless you're generating dynamic form elements i see now reason why you can't just style it with css in your normal stylesheet
[15:27:02] <pace_t_zulu> has anyone had problems with safari's scroll event seeming to be slow?
[15:27:10] <bzitzow> otherj I need to do that and use the already defined "ui-*" selectors?
[15:27:42] <otherj> bzitzow: you'll have to provide a better example of what you're doing
[15:29:53] <bzitzow> There is a box (container), the box is split in the middle (two other containers). The left side contains a form with JQuery UI elements and I need to position them on the screen so they are aligned to the right of the container they are in.
[15:34:02] <bzitzow> otherj: it's like there is a default padding or right margin on the elements.
[15:34:16] <otherj> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/RVBwz/
[15:34:35] <bzitzow> so they don't align to along the same right side vertical line of the parent container
[15:34:46] <BFranks> Is there anything like phpinfo which would spew out the current page's loaded jQuery info?
[15:34:53] <otherj> shoky: any chance you'll be around in 30 min or so?
[15:34:58] <otherj> shoky: need to drive home for power cord
[15:35:09] <shoky> otherj i'm here for now.. might go to sleep soon though
[15:35:20] <otherj> bzitzow: need code probably, but check the inspector to see what class is adding it
[15:35:28] <otherj> shoky: no worried mate, i appreciate the help anyway
[15:35:35] <otherj> see you later maybe
[15:35:41] <shoky> cya
[15:36:16] <sunbeam> when i have a menu, ul li a li a and when hovering over the first li, i want to access this li, how i best do this?
[15:36:25] <bzitzow> otherj: it's a normal "span"
[15:36:32] <bzitzow> that is generated by the JQuery UI
[15:36:43] <shoky> otherj why do you have templates in your javascript :S
[15:37:19] <shoky> no idea what to do with your fiddle or what you want ;p
[15:48:17] <pace_t_zulu> anyone ever worked with the scroll event an safari's inertial scrolling?
[15:48:59] <jeeky> anybody know if there is a way to completely remove/unbind a jQuery UI draggable event stack from an element?
[15:49:05] <jeeky> like a function I don't know about?
[15:49:46] <jeeky> or is it just `delete $(foo).data().draggable; $(foo).removeClass('ui-draggable');
[15:49:59] <pace_t_zulu> jeeky ... $(element).off('drag')
[15:50:16] <pace_t_zulu> jeeky: what are you trying to do ... make something not draggable?
[15:50:49] <jeeky> Well I'm just "resetting" an element to it's normal state before I added draggable to it
[15:50:50] <pace_t_zulu> jeeky ... $(element).draggable('disable')
[15:52:29] <jeeky> pace_t_zulu: I'd use $(element).draggable('disable'), but for this specific case I need to completely unbind the events, position, and remove the $.data() associated with it
[15:52:31] <pace_t_zulu> jeeky: probley best if you explain more clearly what you're trying to do
[15:53:19] <jeeky> pace_t_zulu: I was just seeing if there was some builtin helper for doing this as I've never used jQuery UI before, but I guess there's not :P
[15:54:05] <pace_t_zulu> jeeky: not sure what you mean by position and $.data()
[15:54:21] <pace_t_zulu> but to unbind the 'drag' event ... $(element).off('drag')
[15:54:30] <pace_t_zulu> jeeky: http://api.jquery.com/off/
[15:54:34] <jeeky> pace_t_zulu: Thanks
[15:55:04] <pace_t_zulu> jeeky: i just tested that ... it will unbind the event
[15:55:35] <pace_t_zulu> i'll try this again ...
[15:55:52] <pace_t_zulu> any one have experience with inertial scroll performance on safari ?
[15:56:04] <pace_t_zulu> it is significantly less responsive than other browsers
[15:57:16] <pace_t_zulu> anyone know why this might be the case?
[16:08:53] <bradmaxs> is there a way to order an array by some function when using each()?
[16:09:13] <jeeky> bradmaxs: elaborate
[16:09:44] <novochar> i'm trying to inject some html on a page and then change some of its properties, it looks like $('body').append("<form type='text' id='foo'></p>) //later on... (function editFoo() {stuff; $.get("morestuff", function (data) {document.getElementById("foo").value=data.title} (); and firebug and chrome dev tools don't give much help
[16:09:51] <novochar> i've been struggling with this for the past couple of hours\
[16:09:56] <bradmaxs> I have some info in a session and want to order it by a position field.  Right now it just comes in by its key.
[16:10:42] <novochar> bradmaxs: elementsFromPoint?
[16:11:15] <novochar> if anyone wants to help with my problem it would very much appreciated
[16:11:40] <ajpiano> novochar: what is a <form type='text'>
[16:11:48] <ajpiano> i think you mean <input type='text'>
[16:11:56] <bradmaxs> novochar: thank you I will take a look at that.
[16:12:01] <novochar> my bad
[16:12:14] <novochar> <form><input id="foo">
[16:13:00] <novochar> what i'm doing is fetching some data from my server remotely and throwing that data into the form field
[16:13:01] <sunbeam> when i have a menu, ul li a li a and when hovering over the first li, i want to access this li, how i best do this?
[16:13:09] <ajpiano> novochar: you should try using jQuery to do it, $("#foo").val( data.bar )
[16:13:17] <ajpiano> novochar: and you should also check if the element is being found
[16:13:22] <novochar> it's probably best to put this in a small popup javascript ifram or something, but for now this will work
[16:13:24] <ajpiano> $("#foo").length should be > 1
[16:13:44] <ajpiano> novochar: are you expecting json back but not telling it that it's json?
[16:14:44] <novochar> ajpiano: it is json being sent back
[16:14:49] <novochar> ah
[16:14:51] <novochar> , "json"
[16:14:52] <novochar> thanks
[16:14:57] <ajpiano> :)
[16:16:27] <novochar> i guess you can't change the value of a form text input with $
[16:16:50] <danheberden> novochar: you sure?
[16:18:29] <novochar> nope, the interwebs say you can
[16:20:10] <novochar> .val() Description: Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements.
[16:20:15] <novochar> i need to change not get
[16:24:25] <novochar> interesting
[16:24:35] <novochar> .val is listed here: http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/
[16:26:10] <novochar>  give up
[16:30:36] <bradmaxs> still working on sorting an array via each().  Currently it is taking it's order from the session keys (0,1,2, etc...) but I want it to take the order from a position field instead? any suggestions?
[16:33:20] <ajpiano> novochar: val is a getter and a setter
[16:33:24] <ajpiano> if you pass it an argument it will use that
[16:33:35] <ajpiano> bradmaxs: don't sort using each, sort using sort :p
[16:33:47] <ajpiano> ?mdc array sort

[16:38:53] <otherj> shoky: around sir?
[16:47:02] <sunbeam> when i have a menu, ul li a li a and when hovering over the first li, i want to access this li, how i best do this?
[16:48:32] <Eviltwin> .parent().closest('li')?
[16:51:05] <bradmaxs> ajpiano: trying to use sort but I am sure it isn't correct http://jsfiddle.net/tTEDc/ thanks
[16:57:46] <amaroks> Hello, where should I put a variable if I want to use it at different event, for an example: if I declare a variable at some event I can recall it in another event
[16:57:54] <amaroks> I hope someone knows what Im trying to say
[16:58:24] <sunbeam> Eviltwin: thanks!
[16:59:31] <RohanBhangui> @amaroks: what do ou mean different event?
[17:00:42] <amaroks> RohanBhangui: for an example $('something').change(function() {    here  })
[17:00:46] <sunbeam> $(this).parent().closest('li').addclass('current_item');
[17:00:52] <amaroks> where here is where and when I declare the variable
[17:00:53] <sunbeam> any idea whats wrong with this?
[17:01:24] <RohanBhangui> addclass is suppose to be addClass
[17:01:45] <sunbeam> thx sorry
[17:01:50] <RohanBhangui> np
[17:02:19] <ogk1000> any ideas why this doesnt work? http://collabedit.com/baqxs I just want to find the link with class active then click the next a ... any ideas?
[17:02:21] <sunbeam> $(this).parent().closest('li a').addClass('current_item');
[17:02:27] <sunbeam> hmm still doesnt add class
[17:02:29] <RohanBhangui> @amaroks: so you mean taing the variable $(something) and putting it into hte function?
[17:02:45] <ProLoser|Work> does $.getScript() need to be fired on domready? or can i fire it earlier?
[17:04:05] <amaroks> RohanBhangui: I want var something = $('input').val();
[17:04:10] <amaroks> I want to use something
[17:04:31] <RohanBhangui> just use
[17:04:32] <amaroks> anywhere I want, I want to use it at x.click() or y.click() etc.
[17:04:33] <RohanBhangui> something
[17:04:39] <RohanBhangui> you dont ahve to declare again
[17:04:44] <RohanBhangui> just put somehting = whatever
[17:04:49] <RohanBhangui> or use the variable just like that
[17:04:54] <amaroks> I have it declared before document . ready function and whenebver I use it it says undefined
[17:05:18] <RohanBhangui> have you tried to use console.log() to help you find the value of somehting?
[17:06:09] <RohanBhangui> http://api.jquery.com/change/
[17:06:12] <RohanBhangui> check that demo
[17:06:16] <RohanBhangui> the one about ice cream
[17:06:21] <RohanBhangui> is that what you mean?
[17:06:29] <lenswipe> hey guys
[17:06:32] <RohanBhangui> or the one aobut chocolate sry
[17:06:32] <lenswipe> anyone know about this: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#options-object
[17:06:35] <aaairc> should doing something like this work?
[17:06:35] <aaairc> if($(this).attr('id') == 'view_board'){
[17:06:39] <lenswipe> or even a better jquery form plugin?
[17:06:49] <aaairc> i mean if(!$(this).attr('id') == 'view_board'){
[17:06:51] <lenswipe> im trying to submit an image uplaod form with jquery async
[17:06:57] <aaairc> with the "!" in front of the hasClass check
[17:06:57] <lenswipe> anyone know a better way to do that?
[17:07:01] <aaairc> to basically check that it doesn't have a class
[17:07:26] <ogk1000> $('#nav a.active').parent().next('li').find('a').click(); is that bad practice or fine?
[17:07:55] <ogk1000> aaairc, checkout :not maybe or .not
[17:08:15] <MistuhKurtz> Hey, are the keys in a hash map required to be surrounded in quotes? IE8 has a fatal error with this line of code: var myInput = $("<input />").attr({ class: 'wat' });
[17:08:47] <MistuhKurtz> IE8 doesn't choke on other keys without quotes, like type
[17:09:55] <systemfault> MistuhKurtz: class is a reserved keyword.
[17:10:14] <MistuhKurtz> ahh
[17:10:28] <systemfault> "Reserved for future use" :/
[17:11:04] <MistuhKurtz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Reserved_Words#Words_reserved_for_possible_future_use
[17:11:07] <MistuhKurtz> thanks systemfault
[17:11:13] <systemfault> You're welcome :)
[17:12:00] <MistuhKurtz> Would you say its best practice to always surround keys in a hash map with quotes?
[17:12:15] <MistuhKurtz> or...just don't use reserved keywords without quotes? :P
[17:14:17] <systemfault> I prefer to not use reserved keywords at all :P
[17:20:14] <Lucky--> for the field labels, anyone got any styling ideas/recommendations that are cross-browser/css compatable? http://www.instant-advance.com/requestform.html
[17:30:47] <RohanBhangui> http://fuelyourcoding.com/scripts/infield/
[17:57:06] <rodd> night, shouldn't this code show 'first' or perhaps its first sibling? http://jsfiddle.net/HCYSm/
[17:57:49] <rodd> hm I guess it's overflow
[17:57:49] <Eviltwin> What?
[18:14:37] <amaroks> Whats wrong with this:
[18:14:40] <amaroks> jQuery.cookie is not a functionjQuery.cookie("items", qty);
[18:14:40] <rodd> I'm snooked
[18:15:06] <MistuhKurtz> lol
[18:17:25] <hacks> Why is event.which not the microsoft standard?
[18:17:30] <hacks> for buttons that is
[18:17:54] <hacks> event.which = 1 || 2 || 4 would be better than 1 || 2 || 3
[18:18:26] <rodd> I have to dynamically set the height of a sidebar, based on the height of the 'post' on its left side. That's fine with overflow. However, the items in this sidebar become 'cut' in specific situations. I was trying to get the last element visible after setting the sidebar new height. I'm hitting my head on how to get the last visible item.
[18:18:58] <rodd> I can only think of looping through all elements in that bar and checking if it's visible or not
[18:19:01] <rodd> but that's cumbersome
[18:19:15] <rodd> any ideas?
[18:21:11] <blindMoe> rodd: what is causing it to get cut?  Are you simply not setting the height correctly?
[18:22:20] <rodd> blindMoe I have to set a new height in order to be uniform with the post on its left (same height)
[18:22:32] <rodd> http://jsfiddle.net/HCYSm/1/
[18:23:15] <rodd> ideally the second element would be replaced with the show all button
[18:23:21] <rodd> that way there wouldnt be any cut elements
[18:25:45] <blindMoe> hrmm well it thinks every item is visible
[18:27:06] <rodd> and I can't ( at least I don't know how ) to set display:none to all elements that have been affected by my overflow
[18:31:33] <blindMoe> rodd: sorry not sure I can help you.. running out of time in my day :/
[18:31:57] <rodd> blindMoe no problem, thanks anyway
[18:58:24] <GoGoGarrett> Is there an easy way to increase an elements width by percentage.  Is there anyway to do something like $("#element").width("+=50%");
[19:16:35] <dmishe> Hey, i'm trying to use jQuery to remove some things from a chunk of html. Like: $('big html string').find('a').remove().html()
[19:16:48] <dmishe> but the problem obviously is that html() returns code only for 1st element
[19:18:46] <letterpress> dmishe it might work if you put end() between remove() and html()
[19:18:52] <letterpress> http://api.jquery.com/end/
[19:19:05] <dmishe> interesting, thx
[19:20:58] <rodd> :visible does not work for elements hidden by a overflow, is there an alternative?
[19:40:31] <hacks> $(window).on('mousedown', ':not(.popup, .popup *)', function(){...}) The handler should only trigger when an element that is not .popup or a child of .popup, correct?
[19:42:11] <rodd> ok
[19:42:17] <rodd> found an ugly way around my problem
[19:43:00] <rodd> In order to identify whether an element is hidden (due to an overflow), I scan each child in the parent element and compare its position Top against its parent height
[19:43:01] <rodd> ew
[19:43:14] <rodd> any better suggestion for that?
[19:50:16] <gnarf> hacks: thats probably not a very good way to do that
[19:50:58] <gnarf> hacks: you might want to $(window).on( 'mousedown', function( event ) { if ( jQuery( event.target ).closest( ".popup" ).length ) { return; } } );
[19:51:20] <gnarf> i just don't think the :not selector is gonna perform very well in that delegation
[19:51:33] <gnarf> then again, the closest prolly isn't much better
[19:51:47] <gnarf> it would be even easier to bind a event.stopPropagation() on ".popup"
[19:52:33] <diamonds> is there a way to run two animations simultaneously on one element, targeting it in two different ways?
[19:52:56] <diamonds> they appear to block
[19:53:02] <gnarf> diamonds: if you're using unqueued animations, yes
[19:53:09] <diamonds> how that
[19:53:21] <gnarf> .animate( props, { queue: false, duration: whatever, complete: callback });
[19:53:32] <noobsoup> Hello all!!
[19:54:07] <noobsoup> Is there  a way to select and wrap some text that is not contained in it's own element?
[19:54:16] <noobsoup> Here is an example I"m working on: http://jsfiddle.net/dblurry/DmC39/
[19:54:30] <noobsoup> The question is in the CSS box...
[19:55:17] <gnarf> noobsoup: can you just add the tag in the HTML?
[19:55:21] <gnarf> because its way easier
[19:55:22] <noobsoup> And, unfortunately, i have NO control over the HTML that creates the input above it.
[19:55:28] <noobsoup> I would if I could.
[19:55:33] <gnarf> so like
[19:55:40] <gnarf> select that containing TD
[19:55:56] <ajpiano> noobsoup: you could use ben alman's replaceText plugin
[19:56:00] <diamonds> gnarf: I kiss you!
[19:56:02] <diamonds> thanks
[19:56:23] <noobsoup> ajpiano: I'll look into that...
[19:56:30] <gnarf> call var inside = td.contents(); inside.wrap( "<div>" ); inside.find( "input" ).prependTo( td );
[19:56:31] <ajpiano> ?g ba replaceText jquery
[19:56:32] <bot-t> ajpiano, jQuery replaceText: String replace for your jQueries! - http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-replacetext/docs/
[19:57:12] <gnarf> diamonds: np
[19:57:21] <ajpiano> hacks: is there more than one .popup on the page
[19:57:23] <ajpiano> ?
[19:57:27] <hacks> ajpiano: yes
[19:57:48] <ajpiano> mmk
[19:57:50] <ajpiano> nm
[19:58:03] <noobsoup> gnarf: would "input" be replaced with my text string? Or is that finding any loose text in there?
[19:58:25] <gnarf> noobsoup: its finding the checkbox and pulling it out of the wrap
[19:58:47] <gnarf> .contents() gets the input and the text node, then you append the input outside of the newly wrapped elem
[19:59:15] <gnarf> or i suppose that div is in there too
[19:59:22] <hacks> damn it, I just cleared my IRC log
[19:59:26] <gnarf> so you could inside.find( "div" ).appendTo( td );
[19:59:47] <noobsoup> Hmmm...
[20:00:12] <noobsoup> I'll try that in the fiddle… (Thanks!)
[20:04:19] <LoneStar99> how would I parse the following using jquery --> http://pastebin.com/0CHSBN2B do I need to use jsonp?
[20:06:33] <black_warlock> someone still on?
[20:06:40] <black_warlock> or all dead?
[20:06:56] <black_warlock> oka :D
[20:07:00] <black_warlock> gnight :P
[20:10:08] <noobsoup> gnarf:  :( doesn't seem to work for me...
[20:10:51] <noobsoup> I *think* i understand how it *should* work, but no result.
[20:13:13] <gnarf> noobsoup: hrm
[20:13:33] <noobsoup> I've updated the fiddle… http://jsfiddle.net/dblurry/DmC39/2/
[20:16:14] <gnarf> sorry - filter, not find
[20:16:14] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/DmC39/3/
[20:21:13] <Whirl3d-Out> is it okay not to close the input tag?
[20:24:32] <rodd> Whirl3d in html5 I guess so?
[20:25:04] <Whirl3d-Out> wild. thanks for the reply, rodd
[20:25:30] <rodd> not sure though
[20:28:18] <abjorn> :o
[20:28:29] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky to be in here more
[20:28:31] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[20:30:24] <LoneStar99> howdy do I need to use jsonp to parse a cross-domain api?
[20:30:35] <LoneStar99> or can I use simply json?
[20:30:52] <rodd> fucking firefox
[20:31:10] <rodd> its constant crashes pisses me off
[20:31:11] <Whirl3d-Out> so, I have long been under the impression that it is bad for to assign a bunch of global variables to be used throughout your code, but I just realized that every time I handle a click event, I'm having to reference the same item so it should be cached...why not make it globally available...wouldn't it make things quicker.
[20:32:36] <rodd> thanks whatwg, 1tb of text in one page
[20:34:21] <limpc> hi guys
[20:36:14] <limpc> i added Francois Gelinas' jqueryui timepicker (v0.3.0) to a page, and jqueryui's datepicker stopped working.. (more accurately, it works when watching changes via firebug, just the window appears hidden).  has anyone else had this issue and fixed it?
[20:41:04] <LoneStar99> can someone help with parsing a web service vis json "cross-domain"
[20:42:50] <cdaringe> hi guys.  i've got a jquery ui autocomplete up and running on a search control, but am not sure how to  highlight the selected option. i read around the docs, didn't see anything immediately highlighting this
[20:48:13] <limpc> http://fgelinas.com/code/timepicker/ is what im using.  anyone?
[20:57:47] <ner0x> How can I add data to a element on the fly?
[20:57:55] <ner0x> element.data( key, value ) ?
[21:02:25] <rodd> $.data( elem, key, value );
[21:04:27] <ner0x> Doesn't work?
[21:04:41] <ner0x> elem.attr( 'data-key', value ); does.
[21:04:59] <rodd> that will set an attribute
[21:05:27] <rodd> http://jqapi.com/#p=jQuery.data
[21:05:52] <ner0x> Correct, but it also sets the data appropriately. $.data( elem, key, value ); seems to be broken.
[21:06:32] <rodd> I have had problems with $.data myself
[21:06:45] <rodd> idle around, someone with better knowledge may answer
[21:06:47] <ner0x> It retrieves fine.
[21:15:24] <Whirl3d_> althought the data- prefix for attributes on html elements in html5 is supposed to populate the non-prefixed properties of the data object for an element, it doesn't always work like that. I always check both:   var myValue=$(elem).data("myValueProp")||$(elem).attr("data-myValue");    just in case
[21:16:08] <diamonds> what is this
[21:16:13] <diamonds> >>{1,2,4}
[21:16:18] <diamonds> joops
[21:16:33] <Whirl3d_> to set the data object's properties $(elem).data({object)) or $(elem).data(key, value) works. but does not change the markup...that is to say that it doesn't change any attributes on the element..
[21:17:25] <Whirl3d_> and I believe that likewise, $("elem").attr("data-myProp", myVal) sets the attribute, but does not populate the data object
[21:20:37] <ner0x> Whirl3d: Attempting to get it after using elem.data( key, value ); fails when I later try element.data( 'key' );
[21:21:37] <Whirl3d_> setup a fiddle to demonstrate the issue and I'll bet you find the problem. If not, I'll bet someone can help you once we can see your exact implementation
[21:22:36] <ner0x> Well i've fixed it just adding the attribute
[21:24:06] <Whirl3d_> so if it's fixed and you don't want to setup a fiddle to see where your implement of the $.data method is in error, I guess that means you are just trolling...or what...
[21:24:30] <yakko> hey guys, how can I make a fade-out-then-slide-up animation in jquery? https://gist.github.com/2952274
[21:24:47] <Whirl3d_> fade out then slide up?
[21:24:58] <Whirl3d_> if it fades out, you won't be able to see it slide up
[21:25:48] <ner0x> Whirl3d: No sir, I didn't have it fixed. I figured it out as we were talking.
[21:25:51] <yakko> yeah, I wanted it to stil be visible so I can slide it up
[21:26:08] <Whirl3d_> ner0x, cool
[21:26:24] <yakko> not visible, but to still take some space
[21:26:27] <Whirl3d_> yakko, so you want it to fade out AND slide up
[21:26:53] <yakko> yeah, but not at the same time (like hide() does)
[21:26:59] <Whirl3d_> yakko, so you want it to fade out and then the space that it leaves behind, slide up...
[21:27:06] <yakko> yes
[21:27:13] <Whirl3d_> you will have to use animate
[21:27:36] <yakko> can animate wait until it fades so it starts to slide?
[21:27:38] <Whirl3d_> if you try to use fadeOut or hide shortcuts, they set the display to none...which is not what you want
[21:27:42] <Whirl3d_> Sure
[21:27:51] <yakko> please tell me how
[21:28:21] <Whirl3d_> $("elem").animate({opacity:0}, 300, function () {$(this).slideUp(300;});
[21:29:00] <Whirl3d_> I may have the wrong number of }); but you get the idea. Bascially, in the callback function for the animate method, you want to call the slideup method
[21:29:02] <yakko> oh
[21:29:21] <yakko> slideUp() fadeOut, they all force display:none
[21:29:35] <Whirl3d_> yes.
[21:29:40] <Whirl3d_> hide does as well
[21:30:27] <Whirl3d_> but you can use slideup because if you animate height to 0 (like slideup does), you just as well not display it because it is not taking up any space in the dom
[21:31:37] <yakko> so they all call hide() in the end, right?
[21:32:04] <yakko> so, if I actually wanted it to do three things before hiding?
[21:32:18] <Whirl3d_> then animate the height
[21:32:27] <Whirl3d_> and it doesn't need to hide it
[21:32:55] <Whirl3d_> you can also just queue them
[21:33:22] <Whirl3d_> $("elem").animate({opacity:0},300).animate({height:0}, 300);
[21:34:40] <yakko> animate the height to 50px, then background color changes, then it changes its class causing hidden links to show up
[21:34:56] <Whirl3d_> by default the animate function queues animations on an element...so you could do something like:$(elem).animate({top:50}, 300).animate({left:50},300).animate({opacity:.4}).animate({height:500},300)  and it would do them in order
[21:35:21] <yakko> so chaining them will make the sequential behavior?
[21:35:46] <Whirl3d_> now you are getting specific enough that I would have to see your code to be sure. You can go to jsfiddle.net and post your html, css and js and share the link here
[21:36:00] <Whirl3d_> yakko, they should fire sequentially, yes
[21:37:44] <yakko> cool so $(this).closest('.post').animate({opacity:0}, 'slow').slideUp('slow'); shall do the trick :)
[21:38:22] <Whirl3d_> tias
[21:41:16] <yakko> I used Flex before coming to jquery
[21:41:34] <yakko> and they have sweet transition effects in there
[21:42:12] <yakko> so in jquery I always got terrified with code complexity for having to making callbacks inside callbacks
[21:42:25] <yakko> thanks for showing me the way of the light :)
[21:43:42] <Whirl3d_> np
[21:43:49] <yakko> sadly, nesting callbacks works smoother :) $(this).closest('.post').animate({opacity:0}, 'slow', function() { $(this).slideUp('fast'); });
[21:44:10] <yakko> still, I was affraid of using the animate method lol
[21:44:27] <Whirl3d_> You could setup a custom animation method that returned a deferred object and then pipe them.
[21:45:55] <yakko> yeah, I thought about it too :)
[21:46:23] <yakko> (with simpler verbs of course)
[21:47:00] <LoneStar99> having some parsing issue with the following, nothing happending --> http://jsfiddle.net/PNw2V/
[21:50:12] <LoneStar99> anyone??
[21:53:24] <macmartine> LoneStar99: you're sample doesn't output anything
[21:54:02] <macmartine> *your
[21:54:25] <LoneStar99> yeah... trying to figure out why not...
[21:54:31] <macmartine> did you try success/failure callbacks?
[21:57:19] <LoneStar99> macmartine: no not yet, let me try that
[21:57:55] <Whirl3d_> yakko, here's a version with deferred objects using pipe: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/r7Bz6/6/
[21:59:30] <LoneStar99> macmartine: json is valid,  let me ty  the callback stuff
[21:59:35] <Whirl3d_> LoneStar99, I'm checking back through the logs because i thought we had gone through this with you already. There's only one way to do crossdomain jsonp and its hacky and ill advised...from what I have read. I'll see if I can find the log where we went over this in painstaking detail in the past.
[22:00:04] <Whirl3d_> and if it wasn't with you, I'm sure we have gone through it a number of times...brb
[22:00:36] <yakko> Whirl3d_: wait up, is it that simple to make custom methods to jquery objects? :o
[22:00:46] <Whirl3d_> yup
[22:00:58] <Whirl3d_> now granted I violated some guidelines
[22:01:31] <Whirl3d_> you should try not to break the jquery chain by returning this in each method
[22:01:48] <yakko> sure
[22:02:01] <Whirl3d_> instead, I returned a promise...that' reaks the jquery chain, but it sets up a deferred chain that it really useful here
[22:02:16] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d yeah we went through before, works on some other code of mine, but not here...
[22:03:33] <Whirl3d_> Well if you can remember who helped you with it last time, that's prolly gonna be who has to help you this time. It was hacky and a real pain the ass to get it to work (not reliably), so chances are you aren't gonna get the answers you want unles syou get help from the same folks
[22:03:36] <limpc> how do you replace a keyword in a cloned dom element?
[22:03:47] <Whirl3d_> a keyword?
[22:04:11] <limpc> like i have <div><element id='field_%keyword%'><element2 id='othername_%keyword'></div>
[22:04:23] <limpc> i create a clone of the div and want to replace %keyword% with a unique index
[22:04:36] <Whirl3d_> you are likely going to want to use regex on the html
[22:04:49] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d ok, will try to debug myself
[22:05:08] <limpc> does that work on cloned objects?
[22:05:33] <limpc> i tried replaceText(/\%keyword\%/,myindex) but it errored saying replaceText wasnt a method
[22:05:38] <Whirl3d_> var html=$("div").html();   html=html.replace(/keyword/ig, "newword"); $("div").html(html);
[22:06:00] <Whirl3d_> replaceText ?
[22:06:13] <runvnc>  #javascript
[22:06:33] <Whirl3d_> String.replace is the function I know...never heard of replaceText...
[22:07:15] <raj> thanks shoky!
[22:07:22] <limpc> yea i came across it when googling, im mostly a mootools dev so jquery's kinda new for me
[22:10:35] <limpc> ok that worked great. thanks
[22:11:51] <Whirl3d_> cool
[22:14:43] <fredl> hi guys. I'm using an accordion and am trying to activate a specific section in http://politicap.eu/faq.php?category=politicians
[22:15:27] <fredl> http://pastebin.ca/2162768
[22:16:02] <fredl> I found that solution on stackoverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1899307/jquery-ui-accordion-activate but it does not appear to work.
[22:16:15] <runvnc> what do you mean does not appear to work
[22:16:19] <runvnc> do you get an error or not
[22:16:21] <runvnc> if so what error
[22:16:35] <fredl> no, there is no error but I also do not see an accordion.
[22:17:12] <runvnc> wait you don't see an accordion or the accordion doesn't open to the right section?
[22:17:28] <gnarf> limpc: $.fn.htmlReplace = function( search, replace ) { var args = arguments; return this.html( function( index, html ) { html.replace.apply( html, args ); } ); }; $("div").clone().htmlReplace( /%keyword%/g, "newword" ) )
[22:17:34] <fredl> I don't see an accordion.
[22:17:50] <limpc> gnarf, Whirl3d_'s is much simpler
[22:18:02] <runvnc> why did you say your problem was opening the accordion to a specific section if your problem was actually making an accordion
[22:18:08] <runvnc> first get your accordion loading
[22:18:14] <runvnc> then work on showing a certain section
[22:18:22] <fredl> when I leave out the "activate", $("#header-2") the accordion does work.
[22:18:25] <gnarf> limpc: mine works much simpler across your whole app :)
[22:18:37] <fredl> runvnc - why do you assume I did not do that first? :)
[22:18:38] <runvnc> ok so leave it out
[22:18:38] <Whirl3d_> true that.
[22:18:46] <runvnc> then call it again the second way
[22:18:51] <runvnc> after it shows the accordion
[22:19:01] <fredl> well that's what I did :)
[22:19:13] <runvnc> and then what happened, you saw no accordion?
[22:19:16] <gnarf> i just wrote a htmlReplace plugin that you can use on any element, granted, you REALLY need to be careful about when you use it as rewriting html will unbind all events
[22:19:21] <runvnc> because what you said was you saw no accordion
[22:19:27] <fredl> the "activate", $("#header-2") part causes the accordion to not show anymore.
[22:19:31] <limpc> im not being paid for elegant solutions :P
[22:19:33] <runvnc> if you just called accordion first, then you would see an accordion
[22:19:55] <gnarf> *shrug*
[22:19:58] <limpc> and im pretty sure this is the only place its going to be needed, so its all good :) nice to have that solution though.
[22:20:11] <runvnc> fredl, put it in a jsfiddle
[22:20:15] <runvnc> that pastebin thing doesnt help
[22:20:25] <gnarf> limpc: .html() can take a function too
[22:20:31] <gnarf> that will be passed index, html
[22:20:36] <Whirl3d_> gnaf, why dont yse regex in your solution...
[22:20:50] <Whirl3d_> still going through it ..
[22:20:53] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: it does use a regexp at the end
[22:21:12] <Whirl3d_> lol, I hadn't got that far yet
[22:21:48] <imsky> abjorn, i've been on irc all day
[22:21:56] <imsky> you should play vidya games less and lurkmoar
[22:22:27] <Whirl3d_> gnarf, I don't get what's going on when you write this.html(function (index, html)....
[22:22:35] <LoneStar99> Whirl3d_: jsonp request returning proper json, now having issue just parsing --> {"response": {"version": "1.5", "results":{"ushort": "http://uoid.me/buildasearch5"}}}
[22:22:43] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: https://gist.github.com/328159ff9a1bca63520b
[22:22:51] <gnarf> ?html( function ) @Whirl3d_
[22:23:18] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: .html( function(index, oldhtml) )
[22:23:25] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/html/
[22:24:04] <gnarf> basically, it does an each, passing you the old html, and setting it to the value you return
[22:24:17] <gnarf> and then I return the value from there
[22:24:21] <Whirl3d_> cool. never paid attention to the alternate syntax...
[22:24:33] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: almost all setter/getters work like that
[22:25:04] <paul_irish> chovy: there?
[22:25:24] * gnarf makes sexy eyes @ paul_irish
[22:25:29] <paul_irish> hayyyy
[22:25:31] <Whirl3d_> gnarf, I'm learning that...
[22:26:06] <gnarf> paul_irish: did you see the 1.8 effects pre-docs?
[22:26:34] <paul_irish> i did not
[22:26:37] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/54829d408993526fe475
[22:26:43] <gnarf> Its pretty dense
[22:26:52] <gnarf> but kswedberg could read it
[22:26:55] <gnarf> so im sure it will get better
[22:26:56] <gnarf> :)
[22:27:39] <Whirl3d_> jesus christmas, I have been working for the last two months on something like this...all for nothing...lol
[22:27:50] <abjorn> imsky: more like be at work less and lurkmoar
[22:28:00] <imsky> today's not sunday?
[22:28:02] <imsky> shiiiiit
[22:28:05] <abjorn> lmfao
[22:28:19] <Whirl3d_> it's almost a direct interpretation of the fuse api for as2...
[22:28:31] <imsky> abjorn, sup babeh, haev u seen the surfaces?
[22:28:37] <abjorn> eh?
[22:28:49] <imsky> the thing i just posted on twitter
[22:28:52] <imsky> you not reader
[22:28:54] <abjorn> serc
[22:28:54] <abjorn> sec
[22:29:14] <abjorn> looks
[22:29:17] <abjorn> like a tablet
[22:29:35] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: ?
[22:30:29] <Whirl3d_> if you lookup fuse on mosessupposes.com...it's an animation enginge that uses a very similar syntax...I was trying to implement it in jquery..
[22:30:48] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: oh - interesting, I dreamt it up
[22:30:52] <Whirl3d_> it has most of the same features (maybe some more) that your docs indicate are part of 1.8
[22:31:05] <Whirl3d_> you should really look at fuse. It was great...
[22:31:08] <gnarf> well you can prolly build a good fx+ on top of it
[22:31:11] <Whirl3d_> it might give you some ideas.
[22:31:16] <Whirl3d_> certainly.
[22:31:17] <gnarf> core doesn't need much more
[22:31:51] <Whirl3d_> fuse came with a "simpleSetup" prefilter that included all the common presets like fadeIn and fadeOut or ...
[22:32:17] <imsky> abjorn, yeah but usb and hdmi and keyboard cover
[22:32:28] <abjorn> looks neat
[22:32:49] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: sadly, as we get forward in time, we really just need CSS3 animations
[22:32:50] <imsky> this is like the hottest tech thing of the last 24 hours
[22:32:50] <gnarf> ;)
[22:32:57] <Whirl3d_> I was telling yakko earlier that he could make his own animate method to use promises http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/r7Bz6/6/
[22:33:01] <imsky> you're just containing your excitement abjorn
[22:33:09] <Whirl3d_> true.
[22:33:20] <abjorn> >of the last 24 hours
[22:33:20] <abjorn> way to live in the past, gawd
[22:33:28] <Whirl3d_> I already run a plugin that swaps out jquery animations with css3 animations.
[22:33:29] <imsky> :( i'm only one man
[22:33:29] <abjorn> it's the last hour that matters
[22:33:34] <imsky> OH GOD IM OVERRUN BY ANTS
[22:33:35] <yakko> gnarf: weird, I know gnarg on irc lol
[22:33:45] <imsky> THEY KEEP APPEARING OUT OF NOWHERE
[22:33:52] <imsky> AND CIRCLING STUFF ON MY DESK
[22:33:53] <abjorn> stop leaving sugary things around gawd
[22:34:03] <imsky> these are street ants
[22:34:12] <imsky> they're the size of a usb stick
[22:34:21] <Whirl3d_> but the coolest part of this kind of animation engine is that you can encapsulate complex animation sequences and then apply them easily to multiple targets.
[22:34:22] <imsky> this one dumbass ant keeps circling my lamp
[22:34:30] <imsky> he's in the ant olympics
[22:34:44] <Whirl3d_> and reuse them
[22:35:10] <limpc> hmm having trouble binding events to cloned elements.. this shouldnt be a problem right?
[22:35:16] <abjorn> Ant Olympics: The Second-most Boring Olympics behind the Snail Olympics
[22:35:32] <imsky> he's still circling
[22:35:36] <imsky> brb, throwing him back outside
[22:35:38] <limpc> im trying to call $('.date_field').datepicker({ minDate: 0 }); after my cloning routine
[22:35:42] <abjorn> I Only capitalize Some Words because I Don't Know I feel like It
[22:35:49] <Whirl3d_> combined with johnkpauls latest prefixed method plugin, this will be really amazing...I mean it's already really amazing, but the prefixed methods implementation of "initial states" is really great
[22:36:17] <limpc> i see it executes, 'date_field.hasDatePicker' is added to each input element's class
[22:36:31] <limpc> but click doesnt seem to fire, nor do any errors appear
[22:36:35] <Whirl3d_> a pause state and delay state for the promise would be nice too
[22:36:42] <gnarf> limpc: is it an <input type="text"> ?
[22:36:50] <limpc> yes
[22:37:07] <limpc> the first clone seems to work
[22:37:09] <imsky> abjorn, you been developing that proto engine brah?
[22:37:10] <gnarf> limpc: also, are you attaching before or after doing the clone/replace?
[22:37:11] <limpc> any others added dont work
[22:37:18] <limpc> after
[22:37:29] <gnarf> are you using .find() to find it?
[22:37:41] <limpc> no, im using css selectors
[22:37:46] <abjorn> imsky: yeah, I've been making some decent progress
[22:37:47] <limpc> i pasted it above
[22:37:50] <abjorn> slow, but steady
[22:38:24] <Whirl3d_> don't you have to rebind the datepicker methods for the newly added clone elements?
[22:38:26] <imsky> progress towards wat
[22:38:32] <gnarf> limpc: newClone.find( '.date_field' )
[22:38:40] <abjorn> towards...a working thingie?
[22:38:44] <gnarf> limpc: probably better than $( selector )
[22:38:47] <imsky> lol what a vision
[22:38:50] <imsky> so futuristic
[22:38:51] <gnarf> so it wont find all of them again, just the new one
[22:38:52] <abjorn> inorite?
[22:38:58] <lsterling03> May I ask a jquery question involving adding a class to anchor links?
[22:39:00] <abjorn> it's like, who would have thought you should work to make something work
[22:39:08] <imsky> psh..republicans
[22:39:16] <gnarf> also - does the thing you are cloning have any events bound?
[22:39:18] <abjorn> no you may not lsterling03
[22:39:23] <limpc> hmm ill try it
[22:39:26] <abjorn> </sarcasm>
[22:39:27] <imsky> lsterling03, only if you promise to vote romney 2012
[22:39:28] <limpc> no it does not
[22:39:46] <Whirl3d_> wat!
[22:40:07] <lsterling03> Well, I wasn't planning on it, but I do need help... :)
[22:40:24] <imsky> PROMISE >:|
[22:40:36] <Whirl3d_> lsterling03, ignore him (especially about the romney bs) what is your question?
[22:40:43] <lsterling03> Promise! (crosses fingers behind back)
[22:40:59] <limpc> gnarf - i am applying this after adding my html using appendTo. could that be the problem?
[22:41:00] <imsky> lawl
[22:41:22] <raj> if I do $('#someel').find('#anotherel
[22:41:25] <raj> damn
[22:41:31] <gnarf> limpc: shouldn't be... any chance you can get a reduced case on jsfiddle ?
[22:41:34] <lsterling03> Here is a link to my question, which is probably easier than typing it out here... http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-do-i-add-a-class-to-an-external-jumplink
[22:41:39] <limpc> $('<div />', { id: 'id_here', 'html': replace_html }).appendTo('container');
[22:42:08] <limpc> ill fiddle with it a bit.. if i cant get it to work ill put it on jsfiddle
[22:42:11] <imsky> lsterling03, i can help you
[22:42:17] <imsky> but man that vote is a dealbreaker
[22:42:24] <raj> if I do $('#container').find('#someel').add('#anotherel').add('#thirdel').addClass('newclass') ... will it do it to all elements?
[22:42:39] <gnarf> limpc: that's sexual ;)
[22:42:45] <lsterling03> ha, wait - who was I supposed to vote for? You've tempted me with help. I'll vote for anyone at this point.
[22:42:53] <imsky> excellent
[22:43:10] <imsky> vote for the guy who's cozy with corporations
[22:43:35] <imsky> obamney or roomba
[22:44:06] <gnarf> lol
[22:44:07] <Whirl3d_> gnarf, http://jstween.blogspot.com/
[22:44:19] <lsterling03> well, i suppose i really CAN vote for anyone with that criteria
[22:44:45] <imsky> that's the spirit
[22:45:22] <limpc> cool, .find() solved that problem.. interesting.
[22:45:40] <limpc> why didnt $('.date_field').datepicker() work?
[22:45:46] <gnarf> limpc: you were double-binding some elements maybe?
[22:45:49] <gnarf> also
[22:45:56] <gnarf> maybe it hadn't been appended to the DOM yet?
[22:46:19] <limpc> possibly the latter.
[22:46:30] <limpc> anycase it works now thanks :)
[22:46:36] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/find ;)
[22:46:56] <limpc> http://theoatmeal.com/
[22:47:07] <lsterling03> in any case, i apppreciate the help, imsky
[22:47:17] <imsky> lsterling03, now you wait
[22:48:35] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: kinda interesting, I bet you those could be ported
[22:48:52] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: That API was just an evolution
[22:49:06] <_cS> i need an expert
[22:49:14] <_cS> anyone experienced with jquery ui dialog?
[22:49:15] <Whirl3d_> which? the original fuse api or the jsTween api?
[22:49:26] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: its what came to mind when I finally pulled all of effects apart and wrote it from scracth.
[22:49:30] <gnarf> Whirl3d_: jsTween
[22:49:51] <gnarf> _cS: if our bot was here, he would tell you to just ask your question
[22:50:00] <Whirl3d_> yeah, jsTween was that guys attempt to port the AS Fuse api to javascript...
[22:50:12] <gnarf> ?ask @_cS
[22:50:12] <bot-t> _cS, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[22:50:14] <_cS> gnarf.. sorry =/ it's hard to explain
[22:50:21] <_cS> i didn't want to interrupt
[22:50:33] <gnarf> _cS: we can read multiple threads
[22:50:35] <gnarf> its IRC
[22:50:38] <_cS> i have code here that I put together and i don't know shit: http://pastie.org/4112682
[22:50:55] <gnarf> thats what I like to call a "small wall of code"
[22:51:03] <_cS> there's 2 functions that call two dialog windows to open, and it's the same code except the styles part where the colors change
[22:51:45] <gnarf> yes, these seem very similar
[22:51:47] <_cS> moral of the story is, i need at least the first function (a.ajax_blue.live()) optimized or written properly because there's weird stuff happening when i open more than one dialog box
[22:52:21] <_cS> there's more than one thing wrong with the way they work, and i know there's a right way to do it but i don't know how, i've tried 10 different ways from googling and failed
[22:52:25] <gnarf> you should probably copy all the "common" stuff into a function
[22:52:43] <_cS> well the problem is i don't know javascript well enough
[22:52:58] <_cS> i need major help, i will pay
[22:53:06] <gnarf> ?learn @_cS
[22:53:06] <bot-t> _cS, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[22:53:13] <gnarf> ?101
[22:53:13] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[22:53:13] <imsky> _cS, what's the problem? pm me, i can help out :D
[22:53:13] <bot-t> (2 hours 24 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky to be in here more
[22:53:27] <_cS> i would learn except i have an investor meeting tomorrow
[22:54:07] <gnarf> _cS: understandable, seems imsky wants to dig in
[22:54:08] <raj> why can't I do `var bigobject = $('#somecontainer').find('#someel').add('#anotherel')` ?
[22:54:21] <_cS> yeah i'm talking to him thanks
[22:54:42] <gnarf> raj: you can
[22:55:10] <raj> why can't I do `var bigobject = $('#somecontainer').find('#someel').add('#anotherel'); bigobject.addClass('hello')` ?
[22:55:34] <gnarf> raj: if you meant for #anotherel to also be inside #somecontainer, you could .find("#someel,#anotherel")
[22:55:37] <raj> even with .each() it doesn't work
[22:55:40] <gnarf> and raj - you can...
[22:55:49] <raj> no, it doesn't work
[22:55:57] <gnarf> ?doesn't work
[22:55:57] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[22:56:17] <gnarf> are the elements in the DOM when you are searching?
[22:56:18] <imsky> lsterling03, lol it's difficult to do this in a jsfiddle, you'll need to gimme a couple minutes to do it properly
[22:56:20] <gnarf> ?demo
[22:56:20] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:56:39] <abjorn> ☜(ﾟ∀ﾟ☜ )
[22:56:40] <Eshu> HI
[22:57:04] <imsky> abjorn u light up my midnight
[22:57:05] <raj> as per the docs, it can't do that gnarf--> http://api.jquery.com/add/
[22:57:16] <abjorn> (╯°□°）╯彡┻━┻)ﾟДﾟ)彡☆
[22:57:22] <gnarf> raj: wat?
[22:57:29] <raj> "The following will not save the added elements, because the .add() method creates a new set and leaves the original set in pdiv unchanged:"
[22:57:45] <gnarf> right
[22:57:53] <gnarf> but you are setting bigobject to the set after the add
[22:58:09] <lsterling03> imsky, thanks so much. i couldn't test it out with jfiddle either because of the stupid external link. womp.
[22:58:41] <imsky> yep, iframes suck
[22:59:37] <abjorn> u suk 2
[22:59:48] <gnarf> ?js var a = jQuery([ 1, 2 ]), b = a.add([ 3 ]); console.log( a, b );
[22:59:51] <bot-t> gnarf: [1, 2] [1, 2, 3]
[22:59:55] <imsky> i dont suk!!!!
[22:59:58] <gnarf> raj: ^^^^
[23:00:31] <abjorn> oh but imsky, my boy
[23:00:34] <abjorn> you do, you do
[23:00:36] <abjorn> jkily
[23:00:44] <imsky> IM SO AWSUM I HAV A MYSPACE
[23:00:54] <chee>  imsky and abjorn
[23:00:55] <LoneStar99> can someone tell me why my code is not executing the "BaSCall" function... -> http://jsfiddle.net/PNw2V/2/
[23:01:14] <raj> gnarf, http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/R4bFE/1/
[23:01:29] <imsky> who is chee
[23:01:31] <raj> notice how each of the elements within don't have the class 'hi'
[23:01:40] <gnarf> raj: it can't add( 'p' ) because p isn't within the DOM
[23:01:50] <gnarf> .add( 'p' ) === .add( jQuery("p") )
[23:02:02] <gnarf> not .add( $container.find( "p" )
[23:02:09] <raj> oh
[23:02:10] <gnarf> notice the difference?
[23:02:14] <gnarf> thats why i suggested
[23:02:20] <gnarf> $container.find("p,a")
[23:02:32] <raj> so how do I create an array with a bunch of non-dom elements?
[23:02:50] <gnarf> raj: .add( $container.find( "p" ) ) works...
[23:02:51] <gnarf> also
[23:02:51] <raj> I was currently trying to add them to an array with .add()
[23:02:59] <gnarf> you can use the "or" selector
[23:03:03] <gnarf> ?comma selector
[23:03:03] <bot-t> gnarf, #10224 (wrong value for selector property on chained finds with ... - Opened 7 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10224
[23:03:07] <gnarf> ?or selector
[23:03:07] <imsky> lsterling03, how long are you gonna be around
[23:03:08] <bot-t> gnarf, Multiple Selector (selector1, selector2, selectorN) - Selects the combined results of all the specified selectors. http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[23:03:29] <gnarf> raj: the comma is faster prolly
[23:03:39] <gnarf> $container.find( "p,a,h1" ) works fine
[23:04:06] <lsterling03> I will sit here and stare at my screen until you tell me not to.
[23:04:11] <abjorn> imsky: "imsky and abjorn" the two names just go together, don't they?
[23:04:28] <gnarf> imsky.abjorn.com
[23:04:35] <imsky> who's com?
[23:04:37] <imsky> i don't know a com

[23:04:53] <digs> Okay, can someone give me some ideas of the best way to do this... http://jsfiddle.net/TDWhh/1/  -- I want to take that array and implement it into the non-allowed dates. The array length is unknown, that is just an example of the format.
[23:05:16] <imsky> abjorn, is the j in your name kinda like the j in fjord?
[23:05:25] <abjorn> I can only assume

[23:32:24] <lsterling03> and again... my question: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-do-i-add-a-class-to-an-external-jumplink if anyone else wants to take a stab!
[23:35:11] <Whirl3d_> listerling03, don't you just use a hashtag for linking?
[23:35:47] <Whirl3d_> how funny. Someone just answered 1 minute ago.
[23:35:48] <imsky> paul_irish, i bet you know the answer
[23:36:01] <paul_irish> orly
[23:36:01] <caniuse> paul_irish: http://i.imgur.com/K1D2C.jpg
[23:36:11] <diverdude> What is the difference between document.URL and window.location.href ?
[23:36:34] <imsky> lsterling03, that was pretty much what i was going to suggest
[23:37:12] <imsky> paul_irish, it's very apropos you're asking right _now_
[23:37:18] <diverdude> paul_irish: hey, nice work with html5bp :)
[23:37:19] <lsterling03> oh nice - trying it now.
[23:37:58] <paul_irish> thx diverdude :D
[23:39:18] <imsky> http://imsky.github.com/holder/ @ paul_irish
[23:39:26] <diverdude> paul_irish: still working on that one or something else is cooking? :D
[23:39:41] <paul_irish> diverdude: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2431375/89484
[23:39:45] <paul_irish> diverdude: something else.
[23:39:51] <paul_irish> ill show it at google i/o next week
[23:40:02] <diverdude> ohh nice
[23:40:28] <paul_irish> imsky: so you include the script as an img tag?
[23:40:35] <imsky> paul_irish, what script
[23:41:13] <paul_irish> the holder.js script file
[23:41:16] <imsky> nnno
[23:41:24] <imsky> the domain can be paulirishplaceholder.com
[23:42:04] <diverdude> paul_irish: so jquery is your preferred js lib?
[23:42:07] <paul_irish> i'm nmostly asking
[23:42:21] <lsterling03> that isn't working...
[23:42:21] <paul_irish> do i need to do <script src="holder.js"> ?
[23:42:28] <imsky> yep paul_irish
[23:42:31] <imsky> that's all you need to do
[23:43:36] <paul_irish> i want to do <img 300x200>
[23:43:48] <paul_irish> feature request.
[23:43:52] <imsky> lol
[23:44:29] <paul_irish> diverdude: jquery is my preferred dom and ajax lib yes
[23:44:47] <paul_irish> diverdude: i _was_ on the team for 2 years. :p
[23:46:40] <Whirl3d_> lsterling03, I replied as well. I think you already have link handlers setup for in page and you just wanted to style the links when you load the page...right?
[23:46:47] <diverdude> paul_irish: ohh cool hehe :) mine too - i would not know what to do without it. It seems there are coming many other alternatives nowadays like mootools and such
[23:47:17] <imsky> paul_irish, http://jsfiddle.net/imsky/EmsRn/1/
[23:47:34] <lsterling03> Whirl3d, that is correct.
[23:48:00] <lsterling03> I don't see your reply yet
[23:48:17] <Whirl3d_> I need to verify my account probably. hold on.
[23:49:59] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/YfasE/31/
[23:50:31] <Whirl3d_> its just real simple...you take the hash from the url, find all the anchor elements that have that hash as an href attribute and style them
[23:51:04] <Whirl3d_> the one thing you may need to do is to $("a.active").removeClass("active"); just before the addClass line
[23:51:19] <Whirl3d_> if you page loads with active-styled links already.
[23:51:47] <paul_irish> imsky: neat
[23:52:17] <imsky> you got it chief
[23:53:19] <lsterling03> oh, sorry - mispoke. the page doesn't load with active styles already. the active class is added when you click around the menu within the page. I tried adding your code and was unsuccessful...
[23:53:21] <o]> if I want to create and append a floating img element to the screen, where I can append to?
[23:53:34] <o]> newImg.appendTo('body') ?
[23:53:39] <imsky> lsterling03, i had an inkling that's what you wanted to do
[23:53:46] <Whirl3d_> pm me the url and I'll look at it
[23:54:37] <Whirl3d_> so my code should work unless the links have different href properties..
[23:54:56] <lsterling03> the links only get the active class on click, and i want them to the get it onload.
[23:54:59] <digs> How would I compare a date mm/dd (without the leading 0's) to today to know if matches?
[23:55:02] <Whirl3d_> what does a typical anchor element's href attribute look like?
[23:55:03] <digs> I tried this : var enabled = date.getDay() >= 3 && date.getDay() <= 5 && date.getMonth() + '/' + date.getDate() != "7/4";
[23:55:04] <o]> help!
[23:55:10] <Whirl3d_> THat's what my code does
[23:55:39] <digs> but the last one doesn't work. July 4th is still a valid date to pick.
[23:56:17] <fRAiLtY-> Why does this not select a column, click "Price Matrix" at the bottom. When you select drop-down 1 it should highlight that column. Drop-down 2 successfully highlights a row? http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[23:56:39] <lsterling03> Am i using it incorrectly? Here's all the code: http://jsfiddle.net/YfasE/32/
[23:57:31] <codeAssassin> o]: it doesn't matter, as long as it doesn't have a parent container other then body you're fine
[23:57:38] <digs> Doh!
[23:57:49] <digs> I didn't know that the month was from 0-11 not 1-12
[23:58:26] <Whirl3d_> what is that first part?
[23:58:46] <o]> codeAssassin: I cloned an existing img node from document and I set position to absolute
[23:58:57] <lsterling03> The first part is how I'm adding the active class to the clicked item
[23:58:57] <o]> now I want to show it over the screen
[23:59:24] <Whirl3d_> oh...I see... so that's already there. I thought there was other code that did that. Gimme one second
[23:59:35] <lsterling03> That part was/is working when you're on the page. But linking to it from another page, I want the page to load with the link you clicked with an active class.
[23:59:37] <codeAssassin> o]: have you tried using z-index?
[23:59:51] <o]> codeAssassin: no. what I should set there?
[23:59:59] <lsterling03> Thanks,  Whirl3d
