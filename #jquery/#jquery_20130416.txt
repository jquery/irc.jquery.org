[00:01:01] <F1skr> So I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/Ws9g4/5/ are there any way to pass a dynamic number of arguments, based on the length of promises. Ie. in my example I "grap" a,b,c but if promises is 10 long, I miss 7 arguments..
[00:05:42] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:11:51] <tw2113> F1skr, http://jsfiddle.net/Ws9g4/6/
[00:22:53] <F1skr> tw2113: great, is arguments some kind of global variable?
[00:23:28] <tw2113> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments
[00:23:59] <glaksmono> any ideas why would my scrollTop is always 0 on chrome?
[00:24:27] <F1skr> thank you, didn't know about that
[00:24:48] <tw2113> "You can use the arguments object if you call a function with more arguments than it is formally declared to accept. This technique is useful for functions that can be passed a variable number of arguments."
[00:25:12] <mitzev_> http://jsfiddle.net/G7CLB/ <- why doesnt the dynamic display: hidden not work on safari?
[00:26:25] <goddamnsafari> its me, mitzev_
[00:26:46] <F1skr> tw2113: yea, it's great ;)
[00:26:51] <AL13N_work> how can i set an event to fire at the end of another event?
[00:27:33] <Andrew_R> AL13N_work: trigger it at the end of your first event callback?
[00:28:14] <mitzev2> http://jsfiddle.net/G7CLB/ <-- this menu works as it should on ie, ff, chrome, opera even.. but not safari.. how come?
[00:28:52] <mitzev2> ive checked on safari 5.x myself and in the inspector i can see the css being changed dynamically (display: hidden, display: inline) on mouse in and mouse out
[00:29:08] <mitzev2> but the effect is not working, and also it has strange behaviour
[00:31:33] <AL13N_work> Andrew_R: if only it were so simple
[00:32:38] <Andrew_R> need more information then
[00:33:07] <glaksmono> any ideas why would my scrollTop is always 0 on chrome?
[00:35:06] <Andrew_R> glaksmono: are you checking $('html').scrollTop() or $('body').scrollTop()?
[00:35:17] <Andrew_R> may need to do: var a = $("html").scrollTop() || $("body").scrollTop();
[00:36:30] <glaksmono> i'm using window.scrollTop
[00:36:32] <glaksmono> Andrew_R:
[00:37:39] <glaksmono> i've also been trying using html,body
[00:37:40] <glaksmono> html
[00:37:41] <glaksmono> body
[00:37:47] <glaksmono> and i set html and body width height to 100%
[00:37:49] <glaksmono> doens't seem to work
[00:37:52] <glaksmono> freakkin chrome
[00:40:43] <Andrew_R> try the line I just gave you, var a = $("html").scrollTop() || $("body").scrollTop();
[00:43:38] <maskio> how do i post and open the target to a new window?
[00:43:55] <aakashkrgoel> facing problems in persisting data on dynamically addded rows using .clone()
[00:44:05] <aakashkrgoel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16012660/persist-dynamicaaly-added-rows-jquery-and-server-side-validation-on-dynamically moire desciption here..
[00:44:11] <aakashkrgoel> can anubody help?
[00:45:43] <Andrew_R> maskio: <form target="_blank">
[00:46:58] <maskio> can i do that on a jquery? im passing an array parameter, how do i do that?
[00:47:27] <Andrew_R> aakashkrgoel: so you dynamically add rows, post back to the server, it fails validation so you reload the page, and your rows that were dynamically added are gone, is that your question?
[00:48:29] <Andrew_R> maskio: maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're asking.
[00:49:13] <maskio> Andrew_R: i wana do an ajax post then open it to a new window.
[00:50:34] <Andrew_R> it would be easier to do it not as an ajax post, but a regular form
[00:50:51] <maskio> ah ok Andrew_R, thank you
[00:52:58] <aakashkrgoel> Andrew_R:
[00:53:03] <aakashkrgoel> Andrew_R:  yes!
[00:53:45] <mitzev_> no body :( ?
[00:54:07] <mitzev_> its quite simple, the menu show hide when mouse out, but safari is acting strange
[00:54:15] <mitzev_> s/show/should
[00:54:29] <Andrew_R> one option (continue with the way you are doing it) - you have to put the rows back in there on the server side. jQuery isn't going to remember the rows you added dynamically
[00:55:30] <aakashkrgoel> Andrew_R: okay..lemmensee
[00:55:38] <aakashkrgoel> Andrew_R: okay..lemme see
[00:55:45] <JesperA> Andrew_R: okay..lemmensee
[00:55:49] <JesperA> Andrew_R: okay..lemme see
[00:56:46] <Andrew_R> other option (a larger change) - use ajax to do server side validation on each field before submitting the full form. you'll still need the server side validation on submit and to put the rows back in case the ajax validation doesn't work or just in case someone tries to break your form.
[00:58:24] <Andrew_R> mitzev_: I looked at it in Safari 5.1.7, and I saw the error, but I don't know why.
[00:58:38] <mitzev_> its strange right
[00:58:47] <mitzev_> do u think the js code is right
[00:58:51] <mitzev_> ie., it should work?
[00:59:09] <mitzev_> because it works in all other browsers
[00:59:10] <Andrew_R> I thought maybe the console.log was breaking it (I've seen that happen when users don't have a console object) but I removed those lines and it was the same.
[00:59:33] <mitzev_> i just added those, but yeah without them still doesnt work
[00:59:34] <Andrew_R> yeah it looks OK I think
[00:59:55] <mitzev_> did u try in another browser?
[01:00:04] <Andrew_R> firefox and safari
[01:00:15] <mitzev_> works in ff right?
[01:00:16] <mitzev_> :/
[01:00:52] <Andrew_R> the background for the submenus are still there in FF, but the links hide
[01:01:45] <mitzev_> right, thats the intended way
[01:01:46] <mitzev_> just to hide the links, but keep the boxes
[01:06:55] <lawati> hello i am trying to use jquery ui slider but not able to put ticks or markers on it any idea how ?
[01:07:27] <Andrew_R> mitzev_: I made your code more concise, but it didn't help Safari: http://jsfiddle.net/G7CLB/1/
[01:08:01] <mitzev_> hehe
[01:10:24] <mitzev_> Andrew_R, yes, very nice
[01:10:31] <mitzev_> still have the problem tho :(
[01:12:25] <lawati> Hello i am trying to use jquery ui slider but not able to put ticks or markers on it any idea how ?
[01:13:37] <mitzev_> thats quite a optimized version :o
[01:13:41] <mitzev_> than my one
[01:14:36] <Andrew_R> actually, instead of ".menu-about, .menu-services, .menu-works, .menu-clients, .menu-contact" it could be "#menu li"
[01:16:46] <mitzev_> its strange
[01:17:01] <mitzev_> because i can see in safari inspector the css code updating
[01:17:08] <mitzev_> but not the actual page
[01:23:25] <Andrew_R> mitzev_: interesting, if you do "li" instead of "a" it hides the subform placeholders correctly in Safari
[01:23:46] <mitzev_> ?
[01:24:34] <mitzev_> but i need to keep the boxes
[01:24:47] <mitzev_> and the li's are the boxes right?
[01:26:21] <mitzev_> what do you mean subform placeholders?
[01:26:24] <mitzev_> :/
[01:26:33] <mitzev_> can u fiddle me an example pls so i can see
[01:27:23] <Andrew_R> that's what I meant, the boxes
[01:27:37] <Andrew_R> doesn't solve your problem, but Safari does that right...
[01:28:11] <mitzev_> hmm
[01:28:20] <mitzev_> so you think it could be a bug with safari?
[01:28:25] <Andrew_R> I don't really like this one, but it kinda works: http://jsfiddle.net/G7CLB/2/
[01:28:33] <Andrew_R> yeah I think it's a Safari bug
[01:29:18] <Andrew_R> oh, I guess it works the same as the previous version did in FF
[01:29:36] <Andrew_R> so instead of .hide() and .show(), it uses a negative margin-left to put it off the screen
[01:31:00] <mitzev_> http://jsfiddle.net/G7CLB/2/ this one u mean?
[01:31:05] <Jackboy> How do you guys use History.JS with forms and then also support the onchange event ?
[01:31:06] <mitzev_> it seems to work in safari
[01:31:14] <mitzev_> what dont you like about it?
[01:31:37] <Jackboy> Because you need to load in the data that is returned from the form, but you still need to update the URL state. But when the URL state gets updated, it does a $.get request to look for the page... :P
[01:31:38] <Andrew_R> I thought it was a problem if you move the mouse a little below the top item
[01:31:50] <Andrew_R> but the other version did the same thing in FF
[01:32:00] <mitzev_> :D
[01:32:13] <mitzev_> yup, thats normal, the small gap below the very first item
[01:32:26] <mitzev_> infact it would be nice if i could figure that out too
[01:32:33] <mitzev_> to make it not "blink" when moving over that little gap
[01:33:14] <mitzev_> i tried changing margings/paddings/line-height etc for that
[01:33:18] <mitzev_> but couldnt figure it out
[01:33:37] <ph88> $('nav a').click(function() {   });    <-- how do i find out which of the links was clicked ?
[01:33:59] <Andrew_R> ph88: $(this) is the element that was clicked
[01:34:10] <ph88> oki thx
[01:34:58] <Cork> well this is the element $(this) is the element wrapped in a jquery object
[01:35:02] <mitzev_> Andrew_R, thanks for the solution! works good
[01:35:20] <Cork> (small but important difference)
[01:35:28] <mitzev_> what should do about the bug? report it or something?
[01:35:36] <mitzev_> did u see in the safari inspector that html chaning dynamically?
[01:35:48] <Andrew_R> Cork: I am guessing he wants a jquery object there
[01:36:02] <Andrew_R> mitzev_: I never use Safari, I don't even know how to get into the inspector
[01:36:09] <Cork> Andrew_R: didn't say anything about that :)
[01:36:22] <Cork> just that it's a tiny bit more then the element
[01:37:04] <Cork> mitzev_: sorry missed the start of you're problem
[01:37:07] <Cork> what is the bug?
[01:38:19] <Andrew_R> Cork: this doesn't work in Safari: jsfiddle.net/G7CLB/1/ but this does: http://jsfiddle.net/G7CLB/2/
[01:38:31] <mitzev_> lol Cork you just wake up?
[01:38:55] <mitzev_> Andrew_R, you can enable the inspector in safari options under advanced tab
[01:39:03] <Cork> mitzev_: no been deep in to bug hunting :)
[01:39:11] <Cork> (not jquery related, or even javascript)
[01:39:22] <mitzev_> you mean like buffer overflow bugs
[01:41:39] <Andrew_R> mitzev_: yeah I can see display:inline and display:none going back and forth, but the actual part on the page doesn't get redrawn
[01:42:03] <mitzev_> :D
[01:42:17] <mitzev_> i tried googling solution but no mention of this problem
[01:42:57] <Cork> mitzev_: have you tried using css to handle it instead of with js?
[01:43:35] <Jackboy> How do you guys use History.JS to load data returned from forms into a div but then also use the onstatechange event to load pages??
[01:43:40] <Andrew_R> I saw this and I think it's related: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3485365/how-can-i-force-webkit-to-redraw-repaint-to-propagate-style-changes
[01:43:54] <Andrew_R> Cork: I tried it, and it didn't work either
[01:44:22] <Cork> man my test bay for safari includes running to another computer :s
[01:44:30] <Cork> so can't really help too much :/
[01:45:23] <Cork> so something like http://jsfiddle.net/G7CLB/3/
[01:45:25] <Cork> doesn't work?
[01:45:34] <mitzev_> lol
[01:45:39] <Cork> (yes, its not perfect it was a fast hack)
[01:49:43] <mitzev_> Cork, doesnt work at all
[01:49:44] <mitzev_> "
[01:49:45] <mitzev_> :/
[01:50:48] <Andrew_R> haha I got it :)
[01:50:49] <Andrew_R> http://jsfiddle.net/G7CLB/4/
[01:51:21] <Andrew_R> I added position: relative to the ul.menu li ul li a  style
[01:52:23] <mitzev_> hmmm?!!!
[01:52:55] <mitzev_> nice!
[01:53:29] <mitzev_> so all i needed to do was put position:relative to the a, of the ul li ul li
[01:53:41] <Andrew_R> :p
[01:53:46] <mitzev_> hehe nice job
[01:53:50] <mitzev_> so this isn't a bug after all?
[01:54:08] <mitzev_> just a case of css :D
[01:54:10] <Cork> it is
[01:54:16] <Andrew_R> if it works in everything else, I'd still call it a bug
[01:54:19] <Cork> the relative is a workaround for the browser
[01:54:26] <Andrew_R> just not a JS bug
[01:57:10] <mitzev_> Andrew_R, so u think i should use /2/ revision with added css?
[01:57:13] <mitzev_> or the margin hack?
[01:59:19] <Andrew_R> /4/ revision (/1/ + css change) is better, hiding elements by placing them off the screen isn't great
[02:00:38] <mitzev_> Cork, im not suire about ure version ;p
[02:01:03] <mitzev_> Cork, did it work for you? didnt for me :(
[02:05:35] <Cork> mitzev_: the one that make least work for the browser is the one where you do it though a class on the parent
[02:05:49] <Cork> (and from my point of view is how it should be done)
[02:07:24] <Onkeltem> I'd like to implement smooth vertical and horz scrolling using some easing function. I already found some plugins, but I wonder can I do this using only jQuery and/or jQuery UI
[02:09:52] <Cork> Onkeltem: haven't tested it but should be possible
[02:10:10] <Cork> Onkeltem: though scrollTo has a lot of nice features so i would recommend having a look at it
[02:11:26] <Andrew_R> mitzev_: you know, you can do this all with just css. works in ie 8+ (I think) and everything else
[02:11:29] <Andrew_R> http://jsfiddle.net/G7CLB/5/
[02:12:16] <Andrew_R> (definitely IE8, I'm not sure about IE7)
[02:13:52] <Cork> Andrew_R: that would work back to ie6 (with exception for margin bugs, hasLayout and things like that)
[02:14:03] <Cork> if5.5 wouldn't though
[02:14:46] <Andrew_R> I couldn't remember when :hover was expanded beyond just anchor tags
[02:14:50] <mitzev_> Andrew_R, yes i rememberd i could do it in CSS after i had coded my messy js version...
[02:14:53] <mitzev_> hehe
[02:17:23] <Onkeltem> Cork: thanks, I'll check
[02:18:21] <mitzev_> Andrew_R, do u have any idea how i can stop the "blink"
[02:18:23] <mitzev_> on that menu
[02:18:31] <mitzev_> in that small gap
[02:18:55] <Andrew_R> I'd probably change them to div's
[02:19:16] <Nobita> hi this is my site http://staging.iamknighted.com/, on one of the id "simplemodal-login" i have added a modal layout but its not performing as expected. this is the code written by me for this http://pastebin.com/uU6L1jGe but i think there is some issue since its not performing correctly, may i know here i might be wrong?
[02:19:19] <Andrew_R> ul.menu > li doesn't extend all the way down around the ul inside it
[02:25:35] <Andrew_R> Nobita: your code is being prevented from running by the simple modal plugin
[02:26:09] <zulu-gula> how to define function to be able to do something like that: $(some_element).customFunction(custom_param);
[02:26:38] <zulu-gula> and the custom function could append/prepend html to some_element depend on custom_param
[02:26:53] <Nobita> thanks Andrew_R , how can I prevent or fix it? any solution?
[02:27:24] <Andrew_R> Nobita: there is a "onClose" option you can set when you setup the simple modal plugin
[02:27:38] <Andrew_R> this would be a function that gets called when the modal is closed
[02:27:42] <Nobita> one more thing I want the modal layout for 3 links on page, the way I have followed here I think its incorrect, http://staging.iamknighted.com/wp-content/themes/iamknighted/js/custom.js is it?
[02:28:03] <Andrew_R> all you would need there is the remove class line
[02:28:09] <Nobita> ok
[02:28:29] <ph88> will this work ? http://jsfiddle.net/hbZtT/
[02:29:48] <Andrew_R> Nobita: I'm looking at the docs because I don't think I've used this plugin before.
[02:30:02] <Andrew_R> are you doing $('selector').modal() anywhere?
[02:30:36] <Andrew_R> or is that autowired somehow?
[02:34:24] <Nobita> is there a way in channel to view to past messages?
[02:35:01] <anli__> Can I hide <option> elements in all browsers?
[02:37:30] <shafox> hi can someone give me a sample code for this question? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14050528/auto-fill-my-custom-form-using-facebook-data
[02:40:28] <Andrew_R> anli__:  $('option').hide() doesn't work for you?
[02:40:56] <anli__> Not in all browsers
[02:41:54] <anli__> Wonder how it cannot be supported everywhere
[02:43:54] <Andrew_R> I found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2031740/hide-select-option-in-ie-using-jquery and this seems to work in IE and FF http://fiddle.jshell.net/FAkEK/25/
[02:46:10] <anli__> Yeah, I saw that wrap in span thing
[02:46:17] <anli__> Wonder how cosher that is
[02:46:52] <anli__> The problem with detach is that I want to attach in the same place
[02:47:00] <anli__> So that will add some logic I did not have before
[02:47:30] <Andrew_R> wrapping in span isn't exactly HTML5 compliant, but if it works...
[02:47:42] <anli__> Hm, got an idea actually, maybe I should have an attribute called data-order
[02:47:46] <anli__> data-order="1" etc
[02:47:58] <anli__> Then I .detatch and keep the options for later use
[02:48:33] <Andrew_R> I don't know that I've ever solved this problem like this before. I've always ever just disabled an option or been able to completely reload the select element by ajax.
[02:48:53] <anli__> But if I reload it, it will not be scrolled in the same way anylonger
[02:49:02] <anli__> any longer
[02:49:12] <anli__> It will be too intrusive
[02:49:52] <anli__> Maybe I should consider using divs in a div
[02:50:00] <anli__> That will also let me style it freely
[02:50:18] <anli__> I am already fond of the idea
[02:50:50] <anli__> I will only need to add some selection logic
[02:51:06] <anli__> Can also select non continuously
[02:51:42] <Andrew_R> a multi-select where you don't have to hold down ctrl?
[02:55:27] <futzhu> hi wanna ask. what is different with jquery and jquery UI ??
[02:56:12] <fabioportieri> jquery is a js framework jquery ui is a collections of widget and functionalities built on top of jquery
[02:57:17] <futzhu> i try downloading jquery ui and open demo source they dont use DOM representation like $(document).ready(function(){...})
[02:57:31] <ph88> Andrew_R:  i use $(this) for the current element, how do i select the other ones ??
[02:57:58] <ph88> i want to add a class on $(this)  and make sure that same class is not applied to the others
[02:58:34] <futzhu> hi fabioportieri so in mean i can use jquery UI inside my jquery code to easy make drop down menu something like that right ??
[02:59:01] <Andrew_R> to do that, you can do $('.className').removeClass('className'); before $(this).addClass('className');
[02:59:06] <fabioportieri> futzhu: yes, sure
[02:59:31] <ph88> oh right thx
[02:59:32] <Andrew_R> there's no need to check, if $('.className') doesn't find anything, nothing happens, if it does, it removes the class from the elements it matches
[02:59:54] <ph88> i want to emulate radio button functionality
[03:00:01] <anli__> lol, I could put <option> in <div> :)
[03:00:10] <anli__> mistakenly
[03:00:57] <Andrew_R> ph88: maybe you'd be interested in this: http://jqueryui.com/button/#radio
[03:01:22] <ph88> looks nice, thx
[03:01:45] <maskio> how would i pass an array to form input and on submit, post the array.
[03:02:03] <salencebg> you can achieve that without query, but it's more secure to use what Andrew_R gave you.
[03:02:21] <futzhu> i'm confuse learn this stuff they have many tools like jquery UI, sizzle, quinitjs, etc so in your opinion fabioportieri what is easiest way to understand all of this stuff? which one i must learn first?
[03:02:59] <fabioportieri> futzhu: what do you want to understand exactly?
[03:06:47] <Nobita> ok, for now i have fixed the issue of the modal overlay, but still I'm struggling with the blured text which I need, its only creating the issue only if clicked on id "simplemodal-login" whereas working fine with id "signup_link" & anchor ".menu-item-150 a" http://staging.iamknighted.com/ Andrew_R , can you suggest me on this?
[03:07:54] <futzhu> fabioportieri: i want to learn becoming web designer and programmer PHP. i try to understand jquery for create some nice web page. i learn from try.jquery.com and find the jquery ui link that make me dizzy wich one is the right place to learn. when i look demo source of jquery UI they dont use $(document).ready() while on try.jquery tutorial they suggest to use it every you write jquery code
[03:11:35] <futzhu> drop down text box jquery and jquery UI different in $(document).ready(function{..}) jquery UI never use this DOM ready sign
[03:13:57] <noregret> I got $('#SearchForm').submit(function(d){..}) how can I get the form fields from 'd' ? (this is using the form plugin by malsup)
[03:18:32] <pats_Toms> hi, about query ui sortable. Is there any way to get something out from over event? I want to get which div I am overing, any ideas?
[03:28:15] <ruby_on_tails> hello folks
[03:48:33] <noregret> what can i use to copy some text to the clipboard, is there any plugins for that
[03:52:20] <pats_Toms> you really can't do that because of security, but you can do this with some little flash usage
[04:10:11] <seutje> noregret: github uses https://github.com/mojombo/clippy
[04:17:37] <anli__> Can I select every element that has a class?
[04:17:44] <anli__> foo.find('[classname]');?
[04:17:54] <anli__> must try
[04:19:42] <seutje> anli__:  foo.find('[class]') I suppose
[04:19:49] <anli__> yeah, should be it
[04:20:07] <seutje> but make sure u cache it cause that's not a very cheap selector
[04:21:37] <anli__> I will only select snippets
[04:21:43] <anli__> Its for an item template
[04:22:18] <sahbeewah> it's also not a very correct selector
[04:22:28] <fabioportieri> why the brackets?
[04:22:43] <anli__> Whats incorrect with it?
[04:22:59] <anli__> fabioportieri: else, you would search for <class>
[04:23:39] <fabioportieri> ah, i get it now
[04:24:25] <seutje> it just tries to match any element that has the class attribute
[04:24:38] <seutje> anli__: do note it will also match elements with an empty class attribute
[04:24:43] <fabioportieri> doesn't seems very useful to me..
[04:24:46] <seutje> like <div class>foo bar foo</div>
[04:25:01] <anli__> yeah, but I dont have those
[04:25:05] <anli__> :)
[04:25:07] <anli__> But I have noted it
[04:33:30] <Ivo> How would I tell if this is a collection of elements?
[04:35:46] <seutje> Ivo: this instanceof jQuery && this.length
[04:35:54] <seutje> depending on how strict u want to check
[04:37:39] <lawati> Hi, anyone can explain to me why live() is not supported in new versions of jquery ?!!! it was great and very useful i was shocked to know it is deprecated
[04:37:57] <sacho> lawati, it's deprecated in favor of .on(), which includes all its functionality.
[04:38:03] <seutje> lawati: it's replace by the even-more-awesome .on
[04:38:23] <seutje> frankly, the whole event system was redone
[04:38:43] <lawati> on puts a limitation of specifying the parent of the object i want to attach the event for
[04:39:00] <lawati> so if i want it to act exactly as live i should out the parent as body ?!!
[04:39:19] <sacho> for example.
[04:39:31] <sacho> Although it's a much better idea if you specify a closer container.
[04:40:54] <lawati> sacho, ok will try to that , thanks a lot that was very helpful
[04:42:27] <lawati> seutje,  so this whole event system redone is in favor of making it better as performance , is it that why specifying a closer container while assigning a live event .on is preferred ?
[04:43:09] <seutje> lawati: .live depended heavily on jQuery "guessing" the selector for whatever construct u made
[04:43:10] <sacho> lawati, not specifically. .on simply encompasses the functionality of several functions, which are now deprecated in favor of its syntax
[04:43:46] <seutje> like $('.foo').parent().find('.something').live(/* really hard to determine a selector descending from body based on this traversal */)
[04:44:37] <drager> I'm trying to update this code; to jquery 1.9.0 and jquery ui 1.10.0 https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui-extensions/blob/master/autocomplete/jquery.ui.autocomplete.autoSelect.js
[04:44:41] <sacho> $('.foo').parent().on(events, '.something')
[04:45:01] <drager> But im stuck at; http://dpaste.org/1QCka/ getting TypeError: autocomplete is undefined
[04:45:31] <seutje> drager: did u run this code before autocomplete was loaded?
[04:45:42] <seutje> drager: did u even include the autocomplete widget?
[04:45:55] <lawati> sacho, thanks
[04:46:00] <lawati> seutje, thanks
[04:47:25] <drager> seutje: What do you mena?
[04:48:46] <seutje> drager: does the jQuery UI build you are using include autocomplete?
[04:49:22] <drager> seutje: Yes
[04:49:43] <pats_Toms> someone using jstree? I want to create node which is draggable out of the tree. Everything is ok, but I can't expand parent nodes while dragging them :/
[04:51:13] <seutje> drager: then it's probably being executed before this
[04:51:54] <anli__> Whats wrong with http://jsfiddle.net/dnJBE/ ?
[04:52:05] <anli__> I expect to run the function bar, but I am not
[04:52:05] <drager> seutje: That's weird, because its under jqueryui
[04:52:26] <seutje> drager: having a proper test-case to debug would help a lot
[04:53:37] <drager> seutje: Give me asec
[04:54:00] <lawati> Hey, anyone knows any port of Jquery ui widgets to work in more harmony with asp.NET , i just found this http://juiceui.com/ is it upto date ?! is there better alternative ?!
[04:58:51] <zolek> Hello, I'm using jQuery mobile on my site, and when I click to change to normal view and the page refreshes, the page content is from the full page but I see all the jquery mobile hooks in my code (there are none in the template!) is this some case of browser cache? all goes back to normal after page reload
[05:01:10] <anli__> http://jsfiddle.net/dnJBE/6/ should be correct... should it not...
[05:01:46] <seutje> anli__: not entirely sure what ur trying to get at, but have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/sidonaldson/GY9K2/
[05:02:16] <seutje> u should return this if u wanna maintain chainability
[05:02:25] <anli__> But I dont want to do that
[05:02:32] <anli__> I want to return an api instead
[05:03:48] <seutje> anli__: then u'll have to create a constructor function outside of ur plugin thing and then instantiate it from within
[05:03:59] <anli__> But how can this not give me the same
[05:04:23] <seutje> also, ur code is running too early, not matching any elements
[05:04:37] <anli__> true!
[05:04:43] <seutje> either wrap in doc rdy or put at the botton (u know, like jsfiddle default settings :P)
[05:06:39] <anli__> My latest attempt on http://jsfiddle.net/dnJBE/8/
[05:09:11] <seutje> anli__: http://jsfiddle.net/dnJBE/10/
[05:09:52] <anli__> does not seem to set the text
[05:10:03] <seutje> does for me o.O
[05:10:07] <anli__> oh
[05:10:20] <anli__> Ah, it did for me
[05:10:52] <seutje> do note that this breaks chainability as you're no longer returning a jQuery collection
[05:11:10] <Wolf_22> I'm animating a DIV on mouseenter and on mouseleave. In the animation, I'm changing the opacity (i.e. - on mouseenter, the opacity animates to .25, on mouseleave it goes back to 100). The issue I'm having is that when I do the mouseleave event, there isn't any smooth animation. It just goes from .25 to--boom--100. What causes this?
[05:11:49] <seutje> ?paste @ Wolf_22
[05:11:50] <bot-t> Wolf_22, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:12:21] <anli__> I dont want to include an extra class and certainly not a prototype
[05:12:29] <anli__> I want this to be anonymous
[05:12:58] <seutje> so u just wanna return a static object with a single method on it?
[05:13:20] <anli__> Maybe I want new, trying again on http://jsfiddle.net/r8XHX/
[05:13:26] <Wolf_22> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/e4x2a/
[05:13:28] <anli__> return new function() {} etc
[05:14:19] <seutje> anli__: how about http://jsfiddle.net/dnJBE/11/?
[05:14:51] <anli__> Yeah, of course! Just creating an obj with {} is the thing
[05:14:53] <anli__> Thanks
[05:15:10] <anli__> I should have known that, thanks a lot
[05:15:42] <seutje> feels kinda silly, having a reference around but not being able to reach it
[05:15:53] <anli__> which reference then?
[05:16:06] <seutje> the var div
[05:16:20] <anli__> Thats my version of "private" :)
[05:16:25] <seutje> u can't touch that reference after having called foo
[05:16:27] <seutje> oh
[05:16:29] <anli__> The api is meant to interface the div
[05:16:31] <seutje> not a big fan of privates :P
[05:16:35] <anli__> hehe
[05:16:48] <seutje> YEAH THAT'S RIGHT, I SAID IT
[05:17:08] * anli__ hides
[05:21:18] <seutje> Wolf_22: lol, took me a minute to figure it out, but u are trying to set opacity to 100
[05:21:25] <seutje> but opacity is 0-1
[05:21:40] <seutje> so 100 is actually 10000 %
[05:21:55] <seutje> so 1 tick is like "BAM! fully visible"
[05:22:12] <seutje> Wolf_22: so I changed it to 1, seems to work as expected now
[05:22:13] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/e4x2a/3/
[05:22:26] <seutje> xcept that it queues
[05:23:08] <seutje> so if u mouseenter/mouseleave/mouseenter/mouseleave/mouseenter/mouseleave in rapid succession, it'll keep fading in and out long after you stopped moving
[05:24:47] <seutje> usually I add a stop() in before firing a new animation, to force the animation to stop before starting a new one: http://jsfiddle.net/e4x2a/4/
[05:25:17] <seutje> I also took the privilege to remove some redundant $() wrapping of already-jQuery-collections
[05:25:37] <seutje> liberty*
[05:26:02] <Wolf_22> seutje: I always thought you had to use those wrappers... Wow, thanks!
[05:26:53] <seutje> Wolf_22: the way this is written will make a single dependsOn element trigger the animation of *ALL* required-by elements
[05:27:10] <seutje> not sure if that's what ur going for
[05:27:22] <Wolf_22> seutje: And that's okay because there's only 1 of each of those on the form I'm using this on.
[05:28:53] <seutje> also note that that selector isn't cheap, if you can, do consider using a single class for those or something instead of matching a part of the ID
[05:29:31] <Wolf_22> seutje: That's no problem. I can do that if you think it will reduce processing costs, etc.
[05:33:00] <anli__> How do I make text unselectable?
[05:34:53] <anli__> A found it
[05:35:03] <anli__> Time to upvote another SO posting
[05:35:33] <anli__> I also want to upvote seutje
[05:42:01] <seutje> s'ok, not into chest-pounding all that much
[05:42:02] <deepy> If I have $("first", foo) and want to figure out what it does, what am I supposed to look up in the documentation? I can't figure out the name for it
[05:42:34] <seutje> deepy: put a breakpoint on it and press the "jump into" button
[05:42:46] <seutje> that'll show u the jQuery internals being called
[05:42:53] <seutje> if that's what u meant
[05:44:21] <deepy> I was hoping to just open the docs and read what the , foo) part does
[05:45:53] <seutje> deepy: oh, sry lol http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[05:46:00] <seutje> it's the context bit
[05:46:18] <seutje> basically, it's equivalent to $(foo).find('first')
[05:46:19] <deepy> Ah, thanks
[05:46:28] <deepy> I couldn't find jQuery() in the list and was going mental
[05:46:56] <seutje> yeah, core stuff is sorta separate
[05:55:51] <mazzachre> I am trying to add more functionality to resizable jQueryUI widget... But it does not seem to work... http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/msMJN/2/
[06:01:35] <snorti> my jquery run only for the first #sub2 :( http://jsfiddle.net/u78Am/ any idear to run this on all #sub?
[06:01:41] <snorti> all #sub2
[06:06:25] <mazzachre> Do the $.ui.plugin.add() function work for common users? Or do I need to do other stuff?
[06:07:50] <snorti> ok i am on. have to use class
[06:11:42] <daveyjoe> Is it possible to capture two different types of events using a single statement in jQuery? i.e.. Something like: $('input').on(['change', 'keyup'], func)
[06:12:09] <daveyjoe> … or: $('input').on('change, keyup', func)
[06:14:54] <berger_> hi. does data('val') reliably return undefined, when no data-val attribute is present?
[06:18:15] <mazzachre> berger_: yes
[06:18:57] <berger_> mazzachre: thanks, so i can test against undefined
[06:19:42] <mazzachre> daveyjoe: Yes, 'change keyup' will do that (space seperated list)
[06:20:06] <daveyjoe> mazzachre: Thanks, couldn't figure it out.
[06:20:23] <mazzachre> berger_: You can just do if($('#myelem').data('mydata')) {DO_SOMETHING...}
[06:20:39] <mazzachre> daveyjoe: It is almost the first line in the API documentation...
[06:21:25] <kmdm> Hi guys, having trouble with jQueryUI Sortable with portlets - if I use connectWith: it breaks (at least in Chrome): http://jsfiddle.net/JRmQC/12/ - Anyone any ideas?
[06:22:18] <daveyjoe> mazzachre: Yes, I see it now. My brain automatically scans for code examples though and I couldn't see any.
[06:22:25] <mazzachre> :)
[06:22:56] <mazzachre> kmdm: It works for me
[06:23:17] <kmdm> mazzachre: Hm, with me it seems to go "badly" working out which position the mouse is hovering :/
[06:23:55] <kmdm> but then if you comment the connectWith it works just fine (perfectly)
[06:24:01] <mazzachre> kmdm: Strange... I can move stuff to trash and I can sort them as needed...
[06:24:24] <kmdm> Yea, exactly the problem...
[06:24:30] <kmdm> comment the connectWith and hit Run :)
[06:24:44] <jsn00by> whats the easiest way to make an nested accordion if i got the ul > li > ul > li structure?
[06:24:46] <kmdm> it'll be perfect then
[06:26:28] <kmdm> oh right, I misread, mine just flickers about and doesn't work out where the mouse is correctly (or something) and wants to always sort the element to the end of the list (most of the time)
[06:26:28] <mazzachre> kmdm: Hmmm.. I can see what you mean... That is strange...
[06:26:35] <kmdm> aha :)
[06:26:39] <kmdm> good, not just me then!
[06:26:41] <kmdm> xD
[06:27:27] <inhghodke> hey i need a regexp to match "OR"
[06:28:46] <inhghodke> should match quotORquote -> "OR"
[06:33:08] <amcsi_work> inhghodke: /"OR"/
[06:34:40] <inhghodke> amcsi_work: thanks
[06:55:02] <aro> does anyone know if theres a way to use jquery to make two columns the same height?
[06:56:40] <deepy> $('#first').height( $('#second').height() ) works?
[06:57:14] <aro> what if one is higher than the other
[06:57:43] <deepy> Then it'll change the height of one of them
[06:58:00] <pachet> i mean, isn't that what you're trying to do ;[
[06:58:26] <aro> i know, but the order in which one is higher than the other varies
[06:59:02] <Guest56026> save the two heights into vars and then check if(firstHeight > secondHeight) resize second else resize first
[06:59:35] <pachet> var foo = $('#foo'), bar = $('#bar'); foo.add(bar).height(Math.max(foo.height(), bar.height()));
[07:00:06] <Mottie> aro: check out this demo http://api.jquery.com/map/#example-2
[07:00:48] <sahbeewah> the correct answer is, don't use javascript to solve a css problem
[07:02:05] <aro> sahbeewah: since the page height dynamically changes, we have to rely on some js to a degree
[07:03:47] <sahbeewah> it is because the page height changes that you don't want to use javascript
[07:03:52] <sahbeewah> css gives you this for free
[07:03:59] <aro> how?
[07:05:44] <sahbeewah> i'm not going to teach you css, i'm just pointing you in the right direction
[07:05:47] <sahbeewah> use google
[07:17:03] <aro> sahbeewah: you cant dynamically adjust height with css, at least not < css3
[07:18:53] <aro> but i favor accessibility
[07:19:01] <aro> and graceful degredation
[07:24:54] <anli__> If I for (var key in arr) {}, can I remove keys in the block without disturbing the iteration?
[07:24:59] <newbsduser> $("#selectbox option:selected").val() is not working on "Internet Explorer 6"
[07:25:09] <newbsduser> how can i handle with it?
[07:25:19] <anli__> ie6? why do you support that?
[07:25:35] <newbsduser> there is an embedded device
[07:25:35] <anli__> I would also question supporting ie7
[07:25:39] <anli__> aha
[07:25:44] <newbsduser> i can't upgrade browser
[07:25:44] <anli__> Can you upgrade?
[07:25:46] <anli__> aha
[07:26:03] <newbsduser> because of license issue... it s very big device...
[07:26:17] <anli__> ok
[07:26:41] <anli__> And you cannot run other browsers then
[07:26:47] <anli__> like chrome
[07:29:24] <MrTool> newbsduser: try it with ele = $('#selectbox'); ele[0].selectedIndex, not sure if work on IE6 but you can give it a try
[07:30:52] <maahacka> anli_: you can't fly with a VW Golf, you know
[07:31:19] <xec_> newbsduser: is #selectbox the <select> element? if so you can get the value directly from that
[07:31:30] <xec_> newbsduser: $("select").val()
[07:32:25] <vernonk> yeah, you don't need to include the option part in your selector.  Just the select itself.
[07:35:09] <newbsduser> xec_, there are multiple options
[07:35:20] <newbsduser> i need just selected option
[07:35:21] <xec_> newbsduser: indeed. but only one is selected
[07:35:24] <newbsduser> i ll try it MrTool
[07:35:25] <vernonk> .val() will pull back which one is selected
[07:35:44] <xec_> newbsduser: and reading value off the select element will get the selected option's value
[07:37:34] <sacrilicious> good morning
[07:37:50] <sacrilicious> is it possible to create a function that loops every 5 minutes
[07:37:50] <xec_> afternoon
[07:38:00] <xec_> you mean repeats?
[07:38:01] <sacrilicious> and sends a get request each loop ?
[07:38:06] <xec_> sure
[07:38:12] <sacrilicious> xec_: yes, loops, repeats :P
[07:38:35] <sacrilicious> xec_: do you have some code to show me plz ?
[07:39:28] <xec_> sacrilicious: you can make a setTimeout() inside a function that calls itself, or use setInterval
[07:40:14] <xec_> ?g mdn setInterval @ sacrilicious
[07:40:14] <b-ot> sacrilicious: Sorry, no results for ‟mdn setInterval @ sacrilicious”.

[07:40:23] <xec_> BAD b-ot
[07:40:43] <sacrilicious> ok, will check that morris...
[07:46:41] <shwaiil> hey
[07:47:30] <shwaiil> Q: I'm finding that even though .append* methods are syncronous, the DOM manipulation is not and I have to deal with setTimeout. I'm wondering if there's a different way to deal with this ? Thank you!
[07:48:08] <xec_> shwaiil: what exactly is the issue you're experiencing?
[07:49:51] <shwaiil> xec_: tks for looking. this is not the first I've noticed that there's a difference between .append* methods and having the elements in the DOM. So for example, if I need to count the nr of elements just after the .append finish it returns the wrong elements nr. If I do timeout a bit, will work fine.
[07:51:39] <xec_> shwaiil: can you reproduce it in a fiddle? i thought they were synchronous too, and my little test worked fine http://jsfiddle.net/bN8mq/1/
[07:52:40] <shwaiil> xec_: someone else reported it http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6068955/jquery-function-after-append

[08:04:28] <jsn00b123> I really dont understand the error :/
[08:04:47] <aro> what error
[08:04:49] <xec_> jsn00b123: looks like the plugin you're using is rather old
[08:05:14] <xec_> jsn00b123: have you tried it with an old jquery version?
[08:05:17] <aro> what on earth kind of list is that for accordion
[08:05:20] <jsn00b123> but its working on the demo page and i used 1:1 the same versions http://www.adipalaz.com/experiments/jquery/nested_accordion.html
[08:05:43] <xec_> ah, it states updated, nevermind
[08:05:44] <jsn00b123> its for jquery 1.9
[08:09:40] <jsn00b123> xec_: you got a clue?
[08:10:10] <xec_> jsn00b123: no sorry
[08:10:50] <ablomen> jsn00b123, it seems you have to give the ul an id >> http://jsfiddle.net/baMGx/2/ << i'd drop it and go for a different plugin
[08:11:05] <jsn00b123> ablomen: can you recommend me one?
[08:11:09] <ablomen> nope
[08:11:09] <Z3R0> Morning Guys :)

[08:12:49] <Z3R0> yo yo
[08:15:09] <kensith> I'm not too great with javascript, but I bet someone can tell me where I'm going wrong very quickly... http://pastebin.com/DrBhRpr7  -- nextSrc seems to always be undefined.
[08:16:39] <fabioportieri> kensith: why don't you debug nextLi.children(".updatepic")
[08:17:16] <Z3R0> that seems to be a very complicated way of doing that...
[08:17:20] <kensith> I'll check it out.
[08:17:30] <sacrilicious> how do i fire someone, without being rude ?
[08:17:33] <kensith> Like I said, i just want it to work and be simple.
[08:17:47] <Z3R0> sacrilicious you get someone else to do it ?
[08:17:56] <fabioportieri> sacrilicious: "get the fuck out"
[08:18:22] <sacrilicious> Z3R0: its either me or him, so i need to man up
[08:18:30] <DukeDrake> "We'll have to let you go" ... but that's quite hippocrite imho
[08:18:34] <Z3R0> reason for firing ?
[08:18:36] <Dreamer3> wtf would query not be interpreting html when i use html()
[08:18:41] <Dreamer3> it's inline things like <br> as raw text
[08:19:00] <sacrilicious> Z3R0: lack of motivation and watching movies during work hours
[08:19:07] <Z3R0> oh so what I do ?
[08:19:31] <DukeDrake> Dreamer3: sure you don't have &lt;br&gt; ?
[08:19:41] <Dreamer3> i'm sure
[08:19:58] <kensith> Z3R0,  is there an easier way to debug that? I guess i'm a little unsure of how to even test it.
[08:20:08] <Z3R0> console.log each variable
[08:20:18] <Z3R0> it should tell you what you are retrieving from each as the "selector"
[08:20:40] <kensith> okay, thanks Z3R0
[08:20:42] <Dreamer3> DukeDrake: crap good call, though i have no idea why it was working the other day, not my code
[08:20:53] <Z3R0> kensith but why are you retrieving the LI ?
[08:21:00] <Z3R0> and why not just do next() on the <a> tag?
[08:21:02] <xec_> kensith: you are missing the / in </li>
[08:21:12] <Z3R0> ah yes xec_ didn't notice that
[08:21:13] <DukeDrake> Dreamer3: no worries ... that's what this channel is here for ^^
[08:21:15] <xec_> Z3R0: there is no element next to the A
[08:21:18] <Z3R0> your end LI's are not close tags...
[08:21:31] <kensith> lol true, i just typed that html out though for the example.
[08:21:37] <Z3R0> ah right xec_ I would have just gone through the parent UL though
[08:22:11] <kensith> so does going from a > li > next() > a seem the way to do it?
[08:22:15] <xec_> kensith: with the proper end tags the copypasted code works http://jsfiddle.net/jCLdh/
[08:22:27] <xec_> kensith: yeah the logic is sound
[08:22:45] <xec_> kensith: depending on what you want, of course
[08:23:04] <xec_> kensith: i don't quite see what the script is supposed to do
[08:23:12] <kensith> i just want to move through the thumbnails via previous and next links.
[08:23:14] <Z3R0> it's a image switching xec_
[08:23:20] <Z3R0> next / previous
[08:23:32] <kensith> ya left out the links in the example i guess too.
[08:23:34] <xec_> right, you change the main image to the next, i get it
[08:23:39] <kensith> I know html, its really the javascript I'm worried about.
[08:24:26] <dan2k3k4> How can I load some function to run when the dom changes? since I currently update part of the dom via ajax, which displays a status message and I wanted to display it differently (type writer effect)
[08:24:48] <kensith> xec_, what does the .eq(0) do for me?
[08:25:11] <xec_> kensith: its just a quick fix because all the links have the same URL (so they all match)
[08:25:24] <kensith> oh bad example i guess, my bad.
[08:25:25] <xec_> kensith: it limits the collection to the first match
[08:25:56] <kensith> http://jsfiddle.net/jCLdh/1/ <-- this might be a better exapmle
[08:27:43] <dan2k3k4> jquery mutation
[08:27:47] <dan2k3k4> https://github.com/joelpurra/jquery-mutation-summary
[08:27:52] <dan2k3k4> seems like it might be what I need
[08:28:51] <xec_> kensith: looks like it works to me http://jsfiddle.net/jCLdh/3/
[08:29:22] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/jCLdh/4/ it works just fine ;)
[08:29:39] <Z3R0> I just did some outputting of some vars to see if it would change
[08:29:47] <aBs0lut30> hey guys, got a question... im using jquery to do some ajax stuff on a site I am working on and need to figure out how to do one thing... lets say the user opens the page and gets a list of orders(loaded with .load()) but I want to setup an update for that content ever 5 seconds... all of that I know how to do, my question is how do I load only the changes into the container, and can it be animated to make it look all nice and pretty?
[08:31:08] <kensith> seems to work on JSFiddler, but its not doing the it where I need it ha.
[08:31:24] <Z3R0> lol
[08:32:02] <kensith> instead of li, i get prevObject.
[08:32:06] <kensith> in the console
[08:32:36] <xec_> kensith: do you have a url to the site you're working on?
[08:32:54] <kensith> .click(function(e){
[08:32:54] <kensith>     
[08:32:54] <kensith>     e.preventDefault();
[08:32:54] <kensith>     
[08:32:54] <kensith>     mainImgSrc = $("#mainpic").attr('src');
[08:32:54] <kensith>     current = $("a[href='"+mainImgSrc+"']").eq(0);
[08:32:56] <kensith>     
[08:32:58] <kensith>     currentLi = current.parent();
[08:33:00] <kensith>     nextLi = currentLi.next();
[08:33:01] <xec_> ouch
[08:33:02] <kensith>     
[08:33:03] <BillCriswell> kensith: Sheesh.
[08:33:04] <kensith>     if(nextLi){
[08:33:06] <kensith>         nextSrc = nextLi.children(".updatepic").attr('href');
[08:33:08] <kensith>         console.log(nextLi);
[08:33:09] <xec_> don't pase code in the channel, dude :P
[08:33:10] <kensith>         $("#mainpic").attr('src', nextSrc);
[08:33:12] <kensith>     }
[08:33:14] <kensith> });
[08:33:16] <kensith> oops sorry guys.
[08:33:18] <aBs0lut30> pastebin much??
[08:33:18] <kensith> http://www.jbikennels.com/presas/male/duke
[08:33:20] <kensith> really didn't meant dude
[08:33:28] <kensith> omg it was accident, get over it.
[08:33:39] <BillCriswell> kensith: We can't just get over things like this.
[08:33:57] <xec_> kensith: you just killed 814 unicorns =( not easily forgotten!
[08:34:03] <aBs0lut30> LOL
[08:34:07] <kensith> lol
[08:34:35] <kensith> i''ve never been a big fan of killing unicorns.
[08:34:56] <xec_> no? they taste like chicken
[08:35:06] <aBs0lut30> anybody?? animiate updates to content loaded over ajax??
[08:35:34] <xec_> aBs0lut30: there is no simple answer. jquery is more of a library and less of a framework
[08:35:36] <kensith> i don't know if i would pass up the chance to try that i guess. Probably pretty rare to find it o a menu.
[08:35:46] <BillCriswell> Yeah, probably.
[08:35:55] <xec_> kensith: it's available on the internets http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/e5a7/
[08:36:09] <kensith> oh actually i've seen that.
[08:36:53] <aBs0lut30> xec_: yeah... really just need to be pointed in the right direction... mainly, how would I go about sticking "atomic" content into a container that's already been populated with the first load() call? can prob get the animation from there...
[08:37:22] <xec_> aBs0lut30: i don't get why you're doing a .load() call on first page load in the first place
[08:37:46] <xec_> seems like a waste of a http request
[08:38:05] <aBs0lut30> xec: let's say I have a div that displays orders, and I want to continue to update that list with current orders while the page is loaded
[08:39:29] <kensith> could the difference i'm getting from jsfiddle and on my site being the fact that i have 1.9.1 and i think that uses 1.9.2?
[08:40:01] <xec_> kensith: doubt it, there's no new features used (as far as i can tell)
[08:40:13] <kensith> ok
[08:42:13] <xec_> kensith: the selector after mainImgSrc isn't matching anything
[08:42:14] <aBs0lut30> and as to why I'm doing ajax requests... because it's a whole lot less overhead to refresh a small list of orders than a full page with lots of images, html and JS
[08:42:44] <xec_> kensith: the src of #mainpic is "http://www.jbikennels.com/imgc/display/b3VyZG9ncy9tYWxlL2R1a2UvcGljdHVyZXMvMDkwLmpwZw==" ...?
[08:43:43] <xec_> kensith: there is no link that matches, i guess
[08:43:51] <kensith> Ya, but would that match the first li a.href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/e5a7/http://www.jbikennels.com/imgc/display/b3VyZG9ncy9tYWxlL2R1a2UvcGljdHVyZXMvMDkwLmpwZw=="
[08:44:34] <xec_> kensith: no, it wouldnt .. thinkgeek.com?? :P
[08:44:56] <kensith> oops, my clipboard is all screwed up for somereason.
[08:45:09] <xec_> kensith: i get what you're saying but it doesnt match
[08:45:17] <xec_> kensith: maybe theres a trailing / or something
[08:45:40] <kensith> i think thats it.
[08:45:48] <kensith> the trailing /.
[08:46:24] <kensith> xec_, saved the day, thanks man.
[08:46:50] <kensith> atleast i know where the trouble is.
[08:49:17] <xec_> kensith: you're welcome :)
[08:50:42] <awc737> If p.currentPage = 3, why is this selecting the first li.page element?
[08:50:43] <awc737> http://paste.laravel.com/o7U
[08:52:01] <kensith> oh laravel
[08:52:16] <awc737> kensith, ?
[08:52:34] <awc737> it's jquery
[08:55:40] <awc737> $(p.input + ' li.page:nth-child(' + (p.currentPage + 1) + ')').addClass('current');
[08:55:46] <awc737> that is still 2 behind where I would expect it to be
[08:56:02] <awc737> becuse only the number <li> elements have class=page
[08:56:54] <awc737> does nth-child not care about class selectors?
[08:58:10] <kensith> awc737, just being observant i guess.
[08:58:23] <kensith> lol
[08:58:25] <awc737> AHA. looks like I needed eq(n) instead of nth-child
[08:58:34] <BillCriswell> .eq() or :eq()
[08:58:37] <awc737> yeah, Laravel is pretty aweseome
[08:58:39] <awc737> thanks BillCriswell
[08:58:43] <BillCriswell> Oh, good job catching it before I said something lol.
[08:58:50] <awc737> =D
[08:58:51] <kensith> i'm dying to try it, just haven't had the time.
[08:59:46] <awc737> it's really agile , L4 is in beta, just clone it in Git and you will have a nice hello world
[08:59:51] <awc737> routes and auth and everything is super agile
[09:00:29] <kensith> of course it doesn't work in IE.
[09:00:33] <awc737> I would have transitioned to some JS single-page-app framework views by now if not for Laravel, but it makes templating and partials so damn easy
[09:00:40] <awc737> it does work fine in IE
[09:01:05] <kensith> i mean my script awc737, ha sorry for the confusion.
[09:01:06] <awc737> I need to get something to organize my JS and not pollute though, like Backbone maybe
[09:01:10] <awc737> oh ok
[09:01:27] <kensith> it sounded like you figured your issue out, right?
[09:01:38] <bowenac> is there a way to do an if statement before executing? I am doing a slide down/up etc to show  a sub menu when the parent is clicked, if somone clicks on a different parent it slides up the current shown sub menu and slides down the last clicked one...
[09:02:21] <bowenac> I want to check if a li a of a sub menu is clicked if it is don't slide it up only slide down the last clicked if that makes sense...
[09:02:24] <awc737> yeah
[09:05:27] <maxmoore14> anyone know the typical time between a jquery release and availability on aspnetcdn?
[09:05:56] <jdsharp_> It should be pretty quick (3 days or less?)
[09:06:05] <maxmoore14> jqm 1.3.1 has been available a while now, but not yet on the ms cdn
[09:06:31] <jdsharp_> jam is different than jQuery core
[09:06:32] <NoiseEee> cdn's are bs anyways
[09:06:51] <deepy> saves bandwidth
[09:06:57] <NoiseEee> deepy: rarely
[09:07:09] <zizzl> Hey guys can someone give me an example of a way to detect if an element (specifically an anchor <a>) has a certain color to give it a certain hover color?
[09:07:21] <NoiseEee> there are plenty of published reports/analysis showing cdns are terrible and provide little benefit for distributing JS libraries
[09:07:38] <kensith> after I set a src to a image tag, is there a way to tell when the image is done loading?
[09:07:41] <deepy> NoiseEee: oh come on, those 10kb is something *I* would've had to serve
[09:07:41] <NoiseEee> between the extra DNS lookups, the likelihood that the user has a DIFFERENT version cached... not worth it. serve it youself.
[09:07:43] <kensith> for slower internet connections.
[09:08:21] <supsup> anyone know why i have to trigger change ? when setting prop selected changes it also?  http://jsfiddle.net/VnZwu/
[09:08:26] <kensith> $("image").ready() work?
[09:08:51] <jdsharp_> kensith: $('img').on('load', function() { … });
[09:09:01] <kensith> thanks jdsharp_
[09:11:14] <shoky> supsup: the browser triggers the event only when the user changed it, not the JS code
[09:11:26] <kensith> ya perfect jdsharp_ , thanks agian.
[09:13:38] <jdsharp_> kensith: ^5
[09:13:57] * kensith ^5 ha
[09:14:42] <jdsharp_> kensith: (that's hi-five)
[09:15:08] <kensith> ya I did get it. Very clever.
[09:15:10] <bowenac> how would I make an if statement for if this exists #menu-main-menu li ul li .current_page_item do nothing else do function
[09:15:13] <supsup> shoky: so why does load event work without user change?
[09:15:36] <bowenac> meaning the last li in that has the .curren_page_item class
[09:15:38] <jdsharp_> kensith: there's a reason my name is "sharp" (ok, bad jokes aside)
[09:15:49] <kensith> lol
[09:16:06] <shoky> supsup: that's a different event.. irrelevant..
[09:16:46] <shoky> rhymes too
[09:17:12] <NoiseEee> supsup: events are mostly about user interaction.  if you have a function that should be called on an action, call the function, don't simulate the action
[09:17:15] <supsup> docs says: The change event is sent to an element when its value changes.
[09:17:23] <supsup> not when user does it
[09:17:43] <supsup> i just feel cheap using trigger is all.
[09:17:51] <shoky> don't use trigger
[09:17:56] <shoky> listen to NoiseEee
[09:18:05] <shoky> and you won't feel cheap
[09:18:24] <NoiseEee> supsup: you should feel cheap the way you're doing it
[09:18:40] <supsup> aw
[09:20:01] <pats_Toms> hi, I have random lists in html using <li>. What I want to do is loop that dom and get data in array. http://jsfiddle.net/NywpA/1/
[09:20:03] <pats_Toms> any ideas?
[09:20:26] <supsup> still not fully getting it tho, cause i want the change event to happen, then and in the future.  so it's not just a once time thing which i think is the point, are you saying i should have duplicate code?
[09:20:35] <supsup> or call the function in both places
[09:20:36] <pats_Toms> First idea was some recursion, but then I saw that selecting ul li vices something that I  don' t need then
[09:20:51] <supsup> seems more simplistic to just have it all bottled up in 1 change event
[09:21:37] <bowenac> anyone?
[09:22:23] <supsup> NoiseEee this what u mean? http://jsfiddle.net/VnZwu/1/
[09:23:24] <NoiseEee> supsup: yahhh
[09:23:35] <bowenac> nm figured it out .hasClass
[09:23:52] <NoiseEee> supsup: always better to de-couple/break up into re-usable functions callable from anywhere kind of thing
[09:23:59] <supsup> word alright
[09:24:38] <supsup> i guess even better would of been to not use an anon function and just pass in doWork directly
[09:25:09] <NoiseEee> supsup: it depends. you might want to make other things happen as well.
[09:25:16] <NoiseEee> supsup: or pass the event itself, for example
[09:25:19] <supsup> yah
[09:26:07] <supsup> think docs should say it's user based tho yep yep.
[09:26:26] <supsup> the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse, but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus.
[09:26:27] <supsup> dang
[09:26:30] <supsup> maybe it kinda does
[09:28:00] <ragas> Hello - I have a (constanct contact) script that when loaded onto a page yields a form.  It also loads jQ and creates a conflict.  I came up with a workaround to not load the (cc) script until a click happens.  but the form does not appear.  http://jsfiddle.net/VCrHz/2/
[09:28:09] <supsup> yah nm i done goofed up.
[09:28:32] <supsup> Thanks NoiseEee/shoky
[09:28:42] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[09:29:47] <snorti> look at my 12 teaser boxes at the bottom of this page: http://p189708.mittwaldserver.info .. they are all showing text on hover.  but the last row is moving out of the viewpoint. any way to keep that in viewpoint while fadeIn?
[09:29:53] <semperfried76> need some help with jquery-ui, buttons in dialog window don't appear until window is resized, ie7
[09:33:45] <sarahfrantz> having toggle issues, can someone help?
[09:33:54] <towlieban> i hope you guys can help me. i use jquery to call $.post('myphpfile.php') in my php file i want to redirect to another website but that doesnt work. does the jquery have to be done differently to allow a redirect
[09:34:45] <snorti> anyone know a guide for setting up indexed_search with proper search field and template for search results
[09:37:09] <jdsharp_> towlieban: ajax calls don't follow redirects
[09:38:30] <towlieban> jdsharp_, yea i know :p. is there a way to redirect ?
[09:39:14] <jdsharp_> towlieban: you'll need to manually code it by checking the http response code and then doing a location.href = url from response headers
[09:55:50] <semperfried76> fixed my issue with a *zoom:expression hack that set this.runtimeStyle.zoom ="1"
[10:10:21] <AphelionZ> Is there a way to use a click() event and still get the visual niceness from the :active pseudo class in the CSS?
[10:10:35] <nastus> could anyone see why my first click function is being interrupted by my second? http://jsbin.com/ivujeb/1/
[10:13:28] <sacho> the what now
[10:13:32] <sacho> what makes you think that
[10:13:52] <nastus> ?
[10:14:19] <Andrew_R> besides jquery ui autocomplete, does anyone know of a type ahead combobox plugin for jquery?
[10:14:21] <zizzl> Hey guys can someone give me an example of a way to detect if an element (specifically an anchor <a>) has a certain color to give it a certain hover color?
[10:14:42] <Andrew_R> my problem with jqueryui autocomplete is that it's very slow if I have 1000 items in the select
[10:17:00] <nastus> could anyone see why my first click function is being interrupted by my second? http://jsbin.com/ivujeb/1/
[10:17:12] <sacho> what makes you think one function is "being interrupted" by the other
[10:17:40] <nastus> on my page if I have the first portion it works fine, as soon as the second portion is put in it breaks and the second portion works
[10:17:51] <no_gravity> How would you guys do a simple modal dialog box? Raw js? bootstrap? jquery? something else?
[10:18:11] <sacho> "it breaks"?
[10:18:35] <Andrew_R> no_gravity: jqueryui dialog widget
[10:18:47] <nastus> basically doesnt function anymore
[10:19:13] <sacho> basically what I'm saying is that you're using vague terminology, and if you want to make it easier for someone to help you, you should have a test case
[10:19:24] <no_gravity> Andrew_R: just now i see that bootstrap has something ready: http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals
[10:20:19] <nastus> ah
[10:20:39] <Andrew_R> no_gravity: if you already have bootstrap in your project, you could use that one, if you already have jqueryui in your project, then I'd use http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-message
[10:20:50] <Andrew_R> if you have neither library added, then take your pick
[10:20:56] <no_gravity> Andrew_R: yeah, i have bootstrap already
[10:21:13] <sacho> nastus, the issue is that a function can't interrupt another one.
[10:21:15] <Andrew_R> go for the bootstrap one then, less code to load into the browser
[10:21:28] <Andrew_R> compared to adding another library
[10:21:54] <nastus> ah, well im willing to give someone access to the area to see what im tallking about but i dont think id be able to currently create a duplicate at tthis time
[10:25:51] <shoky> nastus: yer using .indexOf() wrong
[10:26:12] <sacho> start stripping down the problematic code until the problem goes away, then make a page mock and you have your test case - it's how you would go about solving the problem anyway
[10:26:39] <nastus> well I did strip it down, and it started working after I took all the elements out from the second block lol
[10:26:54] <nastus> which is why I am kinda lost aha
[10:27:45] <sacho> well, start adding them one by one
[10:28:02] <nastus> yeah ill try to come back with a test case...
[10:28:08] <sacho> there's a lot of stuff that probably doesn't need to be there
[10:28:30] <sacho> the showtab stuff, the hashchange stuff?
[10:29:42] <nastus> I think ill re-write it and see how it goes
[10:31:58] <bowenac> Curious if someone could look at this line 7 for what I am trying to do... http://pastebin.com/J3dpiGvr
[10:32:54] <bowenac> line 7 I am trying to say if a li does not have a class of current_page_item toggle the slide, as I dont want to toggleSlide on the active submenu
[10:33:11] <bowenac> sorry line 6
[10:36:13] <Z3R0> you really should set your stuff in variables lol
[10:36:24] <Z3R0> can you please script up a fiddle for us ?
[10:36:40] <bowenac> I can send you the link I am working on or a fiddle I guess
[10:36:41] <bowenac> sec
[10:37:12] <Z3R0> fiddle would be better so we can manipulate ;)
[10:41:11] <explodes> Hello...
[10:41:33] <explodes> Using $.ajax, and the promise it returns, should the response fail, how do I get a JSON object out of the failure?
[10:41:39] <explodes> oh derp
[10:46:47] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/yeh8Q/4/
[10:47:08] <bowenac> current_page_item isn't working in that but works on the site as it gets added to the li on click
[10:48:32] <Fenikkusu> I'm trying to run a jQuery Ajax call on a site that appears to be detecting that the Ajax is happening and as a result returning nothing. I'd like to have the $.ajax method respond as if it's a regular browser request. Is this possible?
[10:49:50] <bowenac> All of that is working on the site, what I am trying to do is if someone clicks a link inside the sub-menu, and then clicks another parent, I want to keep the sub-menu with the li current-page-item open and close the other li's as other lis are clicked
[10:50:08] <bowenac> so on each menu click close all li's without a class current-page-item
[10:52:57] <zizzl> Hey guys can someone give me an example of a way to detect if an element (specifically an anchor <a>) has a certain color to give it a certain hover color?
[10:55:15] <bowenac> any of that make sense with the fiddle?
[11:10:29] <bowenac> ok I did it a different way...
[11:15:39] <bowenac> is there a way to keep a slide open? Or do you have to reopen the slide by toggle or slideDown/Up etc
[11:18:34] <GunniH> if I run .post() on a php script, would the php script finish loading even if I close down the site? and if not, is there a way to do so?
[11:19:08] <NoiseEee> GunniH: thats up to how you set up php and ignore_user_abort... ##php
[11:20:13] <lawati> NoiseEee, thats interesting can you please explain more
[11:20:48] <NoiseEee> well you can all check out ##php or google ignore_user_abort
[11:35:59] <clov3r> hello, anyone got a second for some help with selecting a child div
[11:36:08] <clov3r> js fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/clov3r/LNdk3/
[11:36:48] <clov3r> i'm trying to show/hide a descendant div.details
[11:37:02] <clov3r> when the ancestor td is clicked
[11:37:14] <clov3r> not sure about the syntax using "this"
[11:37:39] <Remy> that's incorrect
[11:37:40] <clov3r> $("this div.details") doesn't work
[11:38:02] <Remy> $(this).find('div.details')
[11:40:45] <clov3r> awesome, thanks remy
[11:41:00] <Remy> you bet.
[11:41:30] <clov3r> ah, but now, when i click the close button of div.details... it triggers a click on td.has-events
[11:41:53] <clov3r> e.stopPropagation...
[11:42:06] <clov3r> doesn't seem to work
[11:42:41] <clov3r> ^ @remy (or anyone)... any ideas?
[11:43:09] <spirat> Hello, is it possible to have several $document.read() hooks ?
[11:43:14] <spirat> ready()
[11:43:47] <clov3r> oh wait, yes it does... forgot the brackets
[11:44:05] <clov3r> @spirat: yes
[11:44:11] <spirat> clov3r: awesome, thanks
[11:44:20] <clov3r> but if they all fire when document is ready, you might as well put them in one function?
[11:44:31] <clov3r> ^: spirat
[11:44:45] <spirat> clov3r: yeah, it's just for testing, I got snippets that i want to test quickly
[11:45:29] <ali4ever4> clov3r, if we have multiple $(document).ready in which order they will be fired ?!
[11:45:37] <spirat> clov3r: don't put the '@' before the name, i don't get the highlight ;)
[11:50:30] <walp> hey guys, can i get a little online help with some auto-population of a select element?
[11:51:01] <johnnyandlin> sure, what's up
[11:51:12] <walp> rather not post the url in public, as it may one day contain sensitive info
[11:51:29] <walp> but essentially, i was using 1.7.2, and now i'm using 1.9.1
[11:51:53] <walp> everything else works except this .ajax() success function to auto-populate this dropdown
[11:51:57] <walp> johnnyandlin: permission to pm?
[11:52:04] <NoiseEee> walp: so stick with 1.7.2 ?
[11:52:16] <walp> it doesn't work with either
[11:52:38] <NoiseEee> walp: make up a case with your problem at jsfiddle.net
[11:52:45] <walp> like if i select another id to modify it works flawlessly
[11:52:52] <walp> i can't do cross domain ajax on this one
[11:52:57] <walp> at least not to jsfiddle
[11:53:03] <NoiseEee> so simulate the response
[11:53:23] <walp> well the response is a bunch of <option value="N">Name</option>
[11:53:41] <walp> and i'm doing $("#county_select").html(html) in the success
[11:54:21] <johnnyandlin> and it's not adding the html into the select?
[11:58:24] <clov3r> ali4ever4: not sure, but i imagine all at once, in the order that they appear in the DOM (if that makes sense). but i don't really know
[11:58:45] <NoiseEee> walp: that response isnt formatted as JSON?
[11:59:43] <a2jmrsn> hello, I'm having trouble with this code in IE8 and below http://jsfiddle.net/msjXc/1/
[11:59:59] <walp> it has to be json?
[12:00:15] <a2jmrsn> in IE, it says the content inside the alert equals undefined when index = 0;
[12:00:17] <walp> i was under the impress a simple .ajax() call with dataType: 'text/html' would return just plain html
[12:00:48] <NoiseEee> walp: well debug!
[12:00:51] <fikst> clov3r, ali4ever4 I would expect the to be fired in the order they were added
[12:00:58] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ walp
[12:01:50] <ankurk> Hey!
[12:04:12] <friedbyte> hi, I'm loading some html with .load(). The html loads okay, but when I try to run a click function on the loaded content, nothing is working, ideas?
[12:04:49] <ankurk> can you paste your code on jsfiddle?
[12:05:19] <friedbyte> sure
[12:05:46] <sarahfrantz> I have these tabs, but I'm trying to get the tabbed content to drop down onclick - and then add next/previous buttons to go through each tab ... http://jsfiddle.net/u8atN/5/
[12:06:36] <friedbyte> ankurk: http://jsfiddle.net/rdedv/
[12:07:13] <BillCriswell> friedbyte: async.
[12:07:33] <clov3r> a2jmrsn:maybe add an if(index!=0); alert; else alert($(this).children('li[value=0]')[0]);
[12:07:51] <BillCriswell> friedbyte: http://jsfiddle.net/rdedv/1/ should do the trick.
[12:08:19] <BillCriswell> friedbyte: The reason yours wasn't working is because just because some code comes after the .load() doesn't mean it waits for the load to finish.
[12:09:18] <BillCriswell> friedbyte: You could also do $('#menu').on('click', 'a', function(){ /* Stuff! */ }); if you don't want to use the callback of .load().
[12:09:55] <friedbyte> I like the first option
[12:10:04] <friedbyte> that works perfectly
[12:10:04] <BillCriswell> friedbyte: Word up.
[12:10:07] <clov3r> ok, now i'm trying to run an each loop on all matched elements except the first
[12:10:10] <clov3r> http://jsfiddle.net/clov3r/LNdk3/
[12:10:30] <clov3r> http://jsfiddle.net/clov3r/LNdk3/1/
[12:10:42] <clov3r> (second link, not first)
[12:10:58] <BillCriswell> You just want to skip the first element?
[12:11:10] <clov3r> yep
[12:11:21] <BillCriswell> $('td.has-events').slice(1).each() should do the trick I think?
[12:11:44] <a2jmrsn> clov3r: it didn't quite work.  It now just skips the first <li> element in the <ul>
[12:11:57] <BillCriswell> $('td.has-events:gt(1)').each() could work as well.
[12:12:28] <clov3r> thanks billcriswell
[12:12:35] <BillCriswell> clov3r: No problem.
[12:13:03] <clov3r> a2jmrsn: hmm don't have ie
[12:13:08] <Aji-Dahaka> so what do you jquery folks use to format timestamps for user presentation?
[12:13:19] <Aji-Dahaka> I notice that the jquery-i18n plugin supports it
[12:13:35] <Aji-Dahaka> it looks like jqueryui's datepicker supports it for the date portion of the timestamp
[12:13:45] <a2jmrsn> clov3r: oh, I've got that VM of IE from http://www.modern.ie/
[12:13:47] <walp> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/qQFYq/1/
[12:18:41] <larzen-wrk> Folks, i have am trying to replace some text.. var newdata = data.replace(/<tr><\/tr>/g, '');  ... basically remove all <tr></tr>
[12:19:12] <larzen-wrk> can anyone confirm that = data.replace(/<tr><\/tr>/g, ''); is correct..  it doesnt seem to be working.
[12:20:37] <clov3r> @larzen-wrk regexp isn't my strong point, but i think you want a pipe | in between your two match terms
[12:21:16] <BillCriswell> larzen-wrk: /<\/?tr>/g should work.
[12:21:22] <walp> or /\<(?:\/)tr\>/
[12:21:29] <walp> BillCriswell: or that :D
[12:22:22] <BillCriswell> ~'<tr></tr>Boobs'.replace(/<\/?tr>/g, '')
[12:22:29] <BillCriswell> That worked.
[12:22:38] <BillCriswell> I don't know how to work bots.
[12:23:01] <gnarf> walp: that non-capturing group doesn't have a ? on it
[12:23:07] <larzen-wrk> BillCriswell: just testing now
[12:23:09] <NoiseEee> walp: fwiw you're missing a closing bracket in line 5
[12:23:17] <NoiseEee> walp: also, inline JS is very uh, old.
[12:23:19] <gnarf> also, why bother with a non-capturing group for a single character
[12:23:32] <larzen-wrk> /<\/?tr>/g that didnt seem to work
[12:23:43] <larzen-wrk> i think it took too much. I have other rows with data in them
[12:23:52] <BillCriswell> larzen-wrk: Are there any other attributres on the <tr> element?
[12:24:05] <NoiseEee> larzen-wrk: why mess with regex when you can use jquery to remove table rows?
[12:24:23] <Bloomberg> Someone could suggest me a plugin for may edit in site with a modal windows and update in db?
[12:24:25] <walp> according to regexpal </?tr> should work too
[12:24:59] <larzen-wrk> NoiseEee: because there is a completely archaic system that sends HTML embedded in XML (leave it to SAP!) .. and in order to create whitespace, they added blank <tr></tr>
[12:25:14] <gnarf> Bloomberg: mCreate? http://createjs.org/?
[12:25:32] <NoiseEee> larzen-wrk: string.replace('<tr></tr>','');   ?
[12:25:45] <larzen-wrk> NoiseEee: yes, this is what I am trying to do...
[12:25:51] <NoiseEee> so why are you using regex?
[12:26:01] <BillCriswell> My brain is hurting.
[12:26:03] <gnarf> NoiseEee: if you want //g you need RE
[12:26:04] <walp> NoiseEee: line 5?
[12:26:21] <gnarf> don't you?
[12:26:44] <NoiseEee> i think just a g flag
[12:27:04] <larzen-wrk> none of those regexp worked anyway
[12:27:25] <BillCriswell> larzen-wrk: I think there's more going on than you're leading on.
[12:27:41] <gnarf> js> print('test'.replace('t',''));
[12:27:44] <b-ot> gnarf: est
[12:27:44] <gnarf> @NoiseEee
[12:27:45] <larzen-wrk> nope.. all i need is the "<tr></tr>" -> ""
[12:28:10] <NoiseEee> js> print('<tr></tr>hi folks<tr></tr> love you <tr></tr>').replace(/<tr><\/tr>/g,'');
[12:28:12] <b-ot> NoiseEee: <tr></tr>hi folks<tr></tr> love you <tr></tr>
[12:28:16] <BillCriswell> larzen-wrk: What NoiseEee posted will do that.
[12:28:34] <gnarf> NoiseEee: bad )
[12:28:54] <NoiseEee> js> print '<tr></tr>hi folks<tr></tr> love you <tr></tr>'.replace(/<tr><\/tr>/g,'');
[12:28:57] <b-ot> NoiseEee: No output.
[12:29:01] <gnarf> js> print('<tr></tr>hi folks<tr></tr> love you <tr></tr>'.replace(/<tr><\/tr>/g,''))
[12:29:03] <NoiseEee> oh blow me.  but that'll work.
[12:29:04] <b-ot> gnarf: hi folks love you
[12:29:18] <Bloomberg> <gnarf>: Thanks
[12:29:22] <Bloomberg> I will see it
[12:29:30] <NoiseEee> ty gnarf
[12:29:37] <gnarf> NoiseEee: np :)
[12:29:40] <larzen-wrk> im testing now
[12:29:56] <NoiseEee> walp: onchange="javascript:void(repopulate_subdivisions(this);"
[12:30:29] <larzen-wrk> gnarf: so that's the final?
[12:30:52] <NoiseEee> larzen-wrk: yes.  YourString.replace(/<tr><\/tr>/g,'')
[12:31:12] <gnarf> larzen-wrk: if it doesn't work, pastebin the string you're replacing on
[12:41:50] <walp> ok well it loads the XHR now http://jsfiddle.net/qQFYq/4/
[12:42:00] <walp> i had to add Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
[12:42:14] <walp> it's trying to load jsfiddle.net/ajax.php though which is weird
[12:46:45] <gener1c> are there supposed to be issues with .replaceWith in ie?
[12:47:16] <gener1c> in ff all is fine
[12:47:23] <gener1c> but when i do to ie the element is gone
[12:47:34] <gener1c> i used replacewith to change the tag used
[12:47:40] <gener1c> from div to table td
[12:47:46] <gener1c> (complex layout)
[12:49:23] <BillCriswell> gener1c: Sounds like a blast.
[12:49:57] <gener1c> thank you
[12:50:05] <Bloomberg> What is the best way to do  a div show when the mouse is :hover an element
[12:50:21] <NoiseEee> gener1c: well offhand it sounds like invalid html, so...
[12:50:44] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: If it's a children of the element being hovered you could do div:hover div { display: block; }
[12:50:51] <BillCriswell> If it's a child*
[12:51:48] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/ogupov/1/edit
[12:51:59] <Bloomberg> I have this, but some times getting crazy
[12:53:45] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: http://jsbin.com/ogupov/2/edit if it's a child it could be as simple as this.
[12:55:11] <gener1c> ok works for ie8
[12:55:13] <gener1c> woot woot
[13:00:23] <Bloomberg> BillCriswell: Ihave not idea why in my project doesn't works
[13:00:26] <Bloomberg> I'm following your suggest
[13:01:00] <BillCriswell> I'm assuming it's not a child of the parent.
[13:02:09] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/ZL4e6/
[13:02:11] <Bloomberg> See it
[13:04:55] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: http://jsfiddle.net/ZL4e6/1/
[13:05:04] <fronteers> see here: http://jsfiddle.net/AkQqr/
[13:05:22] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Not sure why yours wasn't working.
[13:06:04] <fronteers> html inline styles are given higher importance than external styles, so you need to append an !important affix. That's not the best solution, so try to avoid inline styles! (that's not the only reason, why you should avoid them)
[13:06:31] <BillCriswell> I think I spelled important wrong when I tried that.
[13:06:32] <BillCriswell> Smooth.
[13:06:45] <BillCriswell> Well, the first link I showed you works haha.
[13:07:28] <sweeper> g'day folks. what's a good way to receive a stream of binary data from a web server? the stream is infinitely long, and I want to chunk it every N bytes and slap it into a mediasource
[13:08:13] <Evan_Donovan> does anyone know of a jquery/javascript plugin that would highlight rows of text based on a timer?
[13:09:09] <Bloomberg> Many thanks to both!!
[13:09:11] <Bloomberg> Works fine
[13:09:13] <Evan_Donovan> to be more specific, i want each row in the text to change from the transparent background to a highlighted background color, in sequence, on a time delay
[13:09:47] <sweeper> Evan_Donovan: sounds niche enough you'd want to do it yourself
[13:09:54] <fronteers> np Bloomberg ;)
[13:09:57] <sweeper> I mean it should take all of 5 lines
[13:10:14] <BillCriswell> Evan_Donovan: You can collect an index of the rows in the order you want to change colors then use setInterval.
[13:10:28] <sweeper> like that ^^
[13:10:41] <Evan_Donovan> sweeper BillCriswell: yea i figured i would have to write it myself, but just wanted to check first
[13:10:56] <Evan_Donovan> it is for a site where people's reading comprehension is being tested
[13:11:14] <Evan_Donovan> client thinks that the highlighting helps people keep their place in the reading
[13:11:56] <BillCriswell> Evan_Donovan: It seems like it'll rush them if it's not quick enough?
[13:12:04] <BillCriswell> I don't know. Not the area of expertise lol.
[13:12:15] <Evan_Donovan> not really my area of expertise either
[13:12:38] <Evan_Donovan> personally it would drive me nuts, but the people who use the current desktop version of the software apparently love it
[13:12:43] <Evan_Donovan> so we have to replicate it on the web
[13:13:00] <Evan_Donovan> and not use Flash :)
[13:13:12] <BillCriswell> So it'll basically just highlight the next line of text in a paragraph every x seconds?
[13:13:16] <Evan_Donovan> yup
[13:13:32] <BillCriswell> Hm.
[13:13:47] <Evan_Donovan> i was thinking i would need to wrap <span> or <div> tags around each of the lines of text so they could be individually targeted
[13:13:51] <Evan_Donovan> tedious, but doable
[13:14:53] <BillCriswell> Evan_Donovan: I'm wondering how you're going to select on a line by line basis. I'm guessing you'll need to calculate based on the size of the text and the size of th container.
[13:15:17] <a2jmrsn> Hi, still a bit curious about http://dpaste.com/1060915/ not working with IE8 and older versions. I would like to use the 0th element but IE seems to think it is undefined. Any ideas to a work-around?
[13:15:19] <Evan_Donovan> BillCriswell: if i mark up each line individually and then set them to have sequential id's
[13:15:30] <Evan_Donovan> that was how i was thinking of doing it anyway
[13:15:34] <gnarf> might be able to drop a div behind the p that's positioned absolute and increase it's height by the p's line-height each timer
[13:15:36] <BillCriswell> You know... you could probably just use a background image and just slide it down by line-height every X seconds.
[13:15:45] <Evan_Donovan> BillCriswell: genius :)
[13:15:48] <gnarf> Evan_Donovan: you wont need id's you can just select all of em
[13:16:04] <gnarf> BillCriswell: ++ on the background-image, dunno why i didn't go ther ;)
[13:16:14] <Evan_Donovan> this is why i love #jquery
[13:16:31] <zizzl> Hey guys can someone give me an example of a way to detect if an element (specifically an anchor <a>) has a certain color to give it a certain hover color?
[13:16:34] <BillCriswell> gnarf: I'm sure there's horrible drawbacks to it that haven't reared their ugly heads yet.
[13:17:26] <Evan_Donovan> ok, so that takes care of one of my problems...now the harder one
[13:17:53] <BillCriswell> Evan_Donovan: I enjoy using this and it seems weird on paper. http://www.spreeder.com/app.php?intro=1
[13:19:29] <Evan_Donovan> i have a section of the software that uses NeuroLinguistic Programming techniques to get students to learn vocabulary terms. it basically involves showing a word then playing a sound
[13:19:46] <Evan_Donovan> are there any jquery plugins that are good for doing what is esentially a presentation?
[13:20:05] <Evan_Donovan> BillCriswell: That is cool, although these people are beginning readers, so it would not work well with them.
[13:20:18] <BillCriswell> It can be slowed down drastically.
[13:21:11] <BillCriswell> Evan_Donovan: The spreeder seems like about half of your goal there. All you'd have to do is play a sound on each advance of the word.
[13:22:43] <Evan_Donovan> BillCriswell: that's a good point
[13:35:05] <alainus> I want to animate a certain element on click(), but I want to reverse that animation when it's clicked again. What's the best way to do this ?
[13:35:47] <CristiDVX> salut
[13:36:11] <CristiDVX> Anybody here??
[13:36:19] <BillCriswell> CristiDVX: Yup.
[13:36:39] <CristiDVX> Bill do you know how regex works?
[13:37:09] <CristiDVX> because i have a problem
[13:38:53] <BillCriswell> CristiDVX: I know a bit about regex. Hopefully enough to help.
[13:39:04] <BillCriswell> Or hopefully know enough to make it so you can avoid them.
[13:40:29] <CristiDVX> i want to make "age verification with regex"?
[13:40:37] <CristiDVX> i have a code but she fail
[13:40:50] <CristiDVX> (1[8-9]$|2[0-9]$|3[0-9])
[13:41:07] <BillCriswell> CristiDVX: age > 17 && age < 39
[13:41:32] <CristiDVX> in code please?
[13:41:39] <CristiDVX> how i put?
[13:42:00] <BillCriswell> if( age > 17 && age < 39 ) { // This person is between 17 and 39 years old. }
[13:42:31] <BillCriswell> age < 40
[13:42:33] <BillCriswell> I mean.
[13:42:54] <CristiDVX> thanks bill

[13:43:41] <b_52globe>  tinyMCE.activeEditor.setContent('[quote] datq [/quote]');
[13:43:57] <b_52globe> but it removes my old content instead of updating it
[13:46:40] <BillCriswell> b_52globe: Are you trying to just wrap what's currently there in quotes?
[13:48:30] <b_52globe> BillCriswell, i want to add something like ::param2::
[13:48:38] <b_52globe> i replaced the code with  tinyMCE.activeEditor.setContent( );
[13:48:46] <b_52globe> i replaced the code with  tinyMCE.activeEditor.setContent( '::param2::');
[13:49:01] <b_52globe> BillCriswell, but it doesn't update it it remove the old content
[13:50:02] <BillCriswell> b_52globe: Not sure I ahve enough experience with this and it's getting close to 5.
[13:50:05] <dcherman> b_52globe: because that's what it's documented to do.  use mceInsertContent.
[13:51:51] <CristiDVX> Bill do you know pawno?
[13:52:58] <b_52globe> BillCriswell, ok thanks
[13:53:11] <b_52globe> dcherman, ok thanks
[13:54:04] <BillCriswell> CristiDVX: No clue.
[14:11:38] <shezar> hello guys
[14:12:09] <shezar> can i use something like a .height for .lineheight in jquery?
[14:14:41] <Remy> .css('lineheight','5px')
[14:14:41] <Remy> ?
[14:14:43] <bot-t> Remy, jQuery - http://jquery.com/
[14:14:54] <alainus> var span = item.closest('[class*="span"'); <- any idea how to do that ?
[14:15:04] <alainus> I'm getting syntax error
[14:15:04] <Remy> is that what you mean shezar ?
[14:15:37] <shezar> i have this function, i need that return height and line-height
[14:15:38] <shezar> (function(a){a.fn.equalHeights=function(){var b=0,c=a(this);return c.each(function(){var c=a(this).innerHeight();c>b&&(b=c)}),c.height(b)}})(jQuery);
[14:15:50] <shezar> please :D
[14:16:42] <Remy> alainus  you have a syntax error
[14:16:42] <Z3R0> Evening Everyone!
[14:16:50] <Remy> missing a bracket
[14:17:00] <Remy> hi
[14:18:18] <BillCriswell> alainus: You missed a ].
[14:18:54] <alainus> BillCriswell, I noticed thanks =)
[14:29:03] <alainus> I'm making this animation, but it seems to be executing everything at the same time, and not one thing after another, like it's supposed to (for example), line 37 seems to be executing before line 24 and 27 in the retraction... Any ideas?
[14:29:12] <alainus> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/99921a0ee7668991860c
[14:30:02] <zizzle> Hey guys can someone give me an example of a way to detect if an element (specifically an anchor <a>) has a certain color to give it a certain hover color?
[14:30:55] <Z3R0> var aBG = $(this).css('color');
[14:31:04] <Z3R0> assuming you are referencing the anchor when clicked
[14:31:21] <Z3R0> or if you want to check "all" you could just do a for each for all 'a' tags
[14:31:33] <Z3R0> then just do a switch based on color to assign the hover color
[14:32:11] <zizzle> Z3R0, not when clicked, when hovered
[14:32:45] <zizzle> so if an <a> has an orange color, a {color:orange;} I'd want a:hover {color:black;}
[14:36:14] <Z3R0> right
[14:36:23] <Z3R0> but I was saying how you were referencing them when the page was called
[14:36:30] <Z3R0> are you doing the action on hover?
[14:37:22] <ThoMe_> hiho
[14:37:35] <ThoMe_> how i can open a url in the frame with name "X"
[14:37:36] <ThoMe_> ?
[14:38:01] <BillCriswell> zizzle: $('a').filter(function(){ return $(this).css('color') === 'organge' ); }).addClass('whenHoveredMakeMeBlack');
[14:39:53] <zizzle> BillCriswell thanks!
[14:40:03] <ionico> hi, do you know why an ajax request shows an old value
[14:40:13] <ionico> a previous result
[14:40:19] <ionico> like an alert dialog
[14:41:01] <BillCriswell> zizzle: Hmm... I think you need to use rgb.
[14:41:22] <zizzle> agh I can't use hex? there's already hex's throughout
[14:41:29] <zizzle> can I pull the hex?
[14:42:09] <zizzle> and also can I change addClass('whenHoveredMakeMeBlack'); to just add a hover color? to make it one step shorty?
[14:42:14] <zizzle> shorter?
[14:42:34] <BillCriswell> zizzle: In chrome at least no matter how the color is defined it returns the color like rgb(0, 0, 0) when you use .css('color')
[14:45:37] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/mK4zE/1/ ?
[14:45:48] <BillCriswell> zizzle: Here's my test stuff: http://jsbin.com/opadah/1/edit
[14:45:49] <Z3R0> zizzle ^
[14:48:00] <ThoMe_> hiho.
[14:48:07] <ThoMe_> howi  can post on the frame with name X ?
[14:48:17] <Z3R0> iframe ThoMe_ ?
[14:48:24] <Z3R0> what frame?
[14:48:37] <ThoMe_> öhm
[14:48:45] <ThoMe_> frameset ?
[14:48:53] <BillCriswell> zizzle: IE6 returns hex, other browsers return rgb.
[14:49:04] <Z3R0> or you can use mine, and simply use class selectors ;)
[14:49:24] <BillCriswell> What a doucher.
[14:49:29] <BillCriswell> I'm out, Later dudes.
[14:49:31] <ThoMe_> Z3R0: hm.
[14:49:37] <gnarf> if he hadn't left
[14:49:40] <Z3R0> ?
[14:49:42] <gnarf> i'd tell zizzle to use jQuery color
[14:49:45] <Z3R0> oh he quite lol
[14:49:46] <ThoMe_> Z3R0: i try it with http://pastebin.com/XeBfZbEC
[14:49:50] <Z3R0> I thought BillCriswell was calling me a doucher
[14:49:55] <ThoMe_> Z3R0: but he open a popup window
[14:50:06] <gnarf> jQuery.Color( element, 'color' ).is('orange')
[14:50:12] <BillCriswell> I don't really think anyone was a doucher haha.
[14:50:17] <BillCriswell> gnarf: That built in?
[14:50:18] <Z3R0> haha BillCriswell
[14:50:22] <Z3R0> ooo... .color ?
[14:50:31] <gnarf> BillCriswell: http://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[14:50:42] <ThoMe_> Z3R0: can u help me?
[14:50:51] <Z3R0> don't know anything about popups lol
[14:51:04] <ThoMe_> is ok. thx
[14:51:07] <BillCriswell> gnarf: You're such a stud programmer.
[14:51:20] <Z3R0> gnarf knows best lol

[15:05:06] <ionico> why jquery ajax repeats all previous calls :(
[15:05:22] <Antiga> ionico: because you asked it to?
[15:05:38] <Z3R0> sounds like someone coded redundantly ?
[15:07:06] <ionico> i dont have any while or something , but all the data i get as result of an ajax call y repeated
[15:07:12] <Z3R0> let's see the code?
[15:08:16] <Z3R0> ? paste
[15:08:16] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:08:38] <Z3R0> gnarf why do we have different bots? are some personal ones?
[15:09:04] <gnarf> Z3R0: bot-t works well, but like his internet is highly unstable, and the guy who wrote him/maintains him is never around anymore
[15:09:16] <Z3R0> ah
[15:09:22] <Z3R0> I miss my bot :( lol
[15:09:25] <gnarf> Z3R0: b-ot is the replacement, written in node by a few of the channel regulars
[15:09:37] <gnarf> project is in #irc-js
[15:09:39] <Z3R0> gotcha ;)
[15:09:52] <gnarf> if you wanna jump in, it could use some help making sure he can truely replace bot-t
[15:10:04] <Z3R0> already in ;)
[15:10:06] <Z3R0> what's node though ?
[15:10:07] <Antiga> I'd help out. Experienced with Node.
[15:10:12] <Z3R0> node.js ?
[15:10:17] <Antiga> Yes.
[15:10:19] <Z3R0> ah
[15:10:19] <gnarf> yeah
[15:10:22] <Z3R0> I've dabbled
[15:10:23] <gnarf> Antiga: #irc-js
[15:10:28] <Antiga> I'm in there :)
[15:10:33] <gnarf> ++
[15:10:34] <Z3R0> my last bot was actually just an irc client lol... and before that python
[15:11:13] <Z3R0> is there a github or something for the bots code?
[15:11:33] <Z3R0> nvm found the url
[15:12:18] <fikst> Z3R0, whats the url?
[15:12:26] <Z3R0> was wrong the url was just the js code...
[15:12:47] <gnarf> Z3R0: thats the bot ;)
[15:12:56] <gnarf> fikst: check topic in #irc-js
[15:13:06] <brunte> Hello. I'm having a bit of trouble understanding selectors in jquery.. How do I write a query that selects all <a> elements that has the class "remove" and are also children of a <div> with id "data"? I'm trying to add a click handler to them.
[15:13:19] <Z3R0> https://github.com/gf3/IRC-js // that's what I was looking for
[15:13:19] <arthurstomp> hi there. Any one knows a jquery plugin to resize and crop image?
[15:13:25] <Z3R0> the http site didn't have anything on it
[15:13:28] <fikst> thanks :)
[15:13:56] <gnarf> Z3R0: except the fork in github corner banner? :)
[15:14:03] <Z3R0> but that's not really the bot itself is it ?
[15:14:09] <gnarf> thats the lib
[15:14:11] <Z3R0> right
[15:14:17] <gnarf> the actual config for bot-t is another repo
[15:14:24] <gnarf> i forget where
[15:14:30] <Z3R0> that's what I was trying to find out, beacuse there's no way to help without knowing what it already has lol
[15:16:12] <Andrew_R> brunte: think of selectors in the same way you do CSS, but with some extra features
[15:16:20] <Andrew_R> all standard CSS selectors will work
[15:17:44] <Andrew_R> $('div#data a.remove') -- includes a's that are descendants of div#data, if you want only children $('div#data > a.remove')
[15:18:49] <dogarrhea> does the trigger event for key press actually simulate key press?
[15:18:59] <dogarrhea> say i focus a text input and trigger. will letters appear?
[15:19:23] <brunte> Andrew_R: Thank you, I will try that.
[15:20:15] <maahacka> dogarrhea: why dont you just try
[15:20:30] <dogarrhea> am currently doing in jsfiddle
[15:20:34] <dogarrhea> but wanted to ask here anyways
[15:20:43] <maahacka> tell me the answer pls
[15:21:38] <dogarrhea> http://jsfiddle.net/aVexK/
[15:21:48] <dogarrhea> maybe i need to wait for dom ready it's not show up
[15:23:04] <Z3R0> what are you trying to trigger dogarrhea ?
[15:23:10] <Z3R0> there's no response to say it worked anyways
[15:23:46] <dogarrhea> Z3R0: i'm trying to put the text there with the keypress event
[15:29:00] <Guest14764> Hello, I am creating a JQuery tooltip plugin and I am having a problem. Could someone, please, help me out?
[15:29:27] <Z3R0> ? paste
[15:29:27] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:29:33] <Guest14764> http://codepen.io/mdmoura/pen/wzfbh
[15:29:42] <Guest14764> I am using codepen. Is it ok? http://codepen.io/mdmoura/pen/wzfbh
[15:30:09] <Guest14764> Basically, I would like to be able to move the mouse over the tooltip so I can sometimes have a few links there.
[15:31:09] <ionico> this is my nightmare,  everytime i made an ajax call show all previous result,  this is part of my code,  the alert dialog will show the number or times i made the ajax call; http://jsfiddle.net/avhHF/3/
[15:31:20] <ionico> can you help me
[15:31:34] <ionico> the alert must show just one
[15:31:46] <ionico> but it shows all previuos
[15:32:30] <Guest14764> The tooltip disappears when the mouse moves out from it after being over it. But if I move the mouse away from the anchor without being over the tooltip then the tooltip does not disappear.
[15:34:24] <brunte> Andrew_R: I couldn't get it to work. This is how my document structure looks like: http://jsfiddle.net/PqkeR/  It's the a.remove's between the start and end dynamic content I want to select.
[15:36:29] <Guest14764> Should I post my plugin code to JSFiffle or Codepen is ok?
[15:41:33] <larzen-wrk> Is there a query command that i can use to target empty elements?
[15:41:49] <larzen-wrk> say I have <div></div> among other divs... is there a way I can identify all those rows?
[15:48:30] <n1k4r0> larzen-wrk try the :empty selector: http://api.jquery.com/empty-selector/
[15:55:19] <semperfried76> zoom hack not as effective as I thought, still need help with disappearing buttons on jquery-ui modular window in IE7
[15:57:09] <semperfried76> I saw a bug reported for this in the forum that has been ignored for a long time... http://forum.jquery.com/topic/modal-dialog-buttons-disappears-in-ie7
[15:57:30] <semperfried76> not my code, but same problem
[15:58:08] <semperfried76> have thrown tons of css at those buttons, nothing sticks, only thing that makes them show up is resizing the window
[15:59:25] <brunte> If I'm using the code "$("#data").on("click", "a", function(){ /* code */});" I can add a click handler for all links inside #data, but how would I change it to only affect links of class "remove"? I tried a.remove but that didn't work.
[16:01:19] <shoky> semperfried76: got a testcase? that code from the forum works fine for me
[16:01:33] <brunte> Actually, ignore what I just said.. It was a spelling error on my part :(
[16:01:37] <semperfried76> brunte try $('.remove').click(function(){...})...
[16:02:04] <ionico> hi, everytime i made an ajax call show all previous result,  this is part of my code,  the alert dialog will show the number or times i made the ajax call; http://jsfiddle.net/avhHF/3/
[16:03:26] <semperfried76> shoky: just looking for possible causes of the issue, I just want to know where I should be looking
[16:03:53] <semperfried76> the app I'm working on is gigantic and I don't know where to start
[16:04:13] <shoky> by making a testcase ;S
[16:05:32] <shoky> ionico: why is that .ajaxComplete there..?
[16:08:23] <ionico> i dont know, i used this code, it works fine but
[16:08:29] <shoky> ionico:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/avhHF/5/
[16:08:36] <ionico> it repeats all previus ajax results
[16:08:38] <shoky> don't use ajaxComplete
[16:08:42] <ionico> ok
[16:08:49] <ionico> letme try
[16:08:52] <shoky> especially not inside another callback
[16:11:06] <ionico> ok now the alert is not repeated, nice!,  but now the text processing wait... never stops
[16:13:01] <shoky> ionico: seems fine  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/avhHF/6/
[16:14:33] <tdignan> when I update an elements class with addClass, will it cause any applicable CSS rules to take effect
[16:14:40] <shoky> ionico: did you change the $(this).html(msg)  to $("#status").html(msg)   ?
[16:14:41] <tdignan> because my observation is no
[16:15:16] <ionico> letme try
[16:15:20] <shoky> tdignan: it should, yeah, generally..
[16:15:29] <tdignan> weird
[16:15:32] <gnarf> tdignan: always ;)
[16:15:32] <tdignan> I wonder what I am doing wrong.
[16:15:37] <tdignan> cool
[16:15:40] <tdignan> thanks
[16:15:47] <gnarf> tdignan: are there inline styles
[16:15:49] <gnarf> those always win
[16:15:54] <tdignan> there aren't

[16:49:41] <coldhead> lol GD
[16:51:16] <mathRand> Guys i would love to share with you a jQuery plugin i've created hoping it will help some of you, https://github.com/ramigb/jQueryBinder , feel free to ask me anything :)
[16:53:31] <LaMakina> cool stuff mathRand
[16:54:58] <mathRand> thank you LaMakina :)
[16:55:17] <coldhead> mathRand: are you putting this on the plugins site?
[16:56:01] <mathRand> coldhead, the http://plugins.jquery.com/ one?
[16:56:20] <coldhead> sure
[16:56:33] <Z3R0> it's really just the basic events and returns right?
[16:56:53] <mathRand> yeah i want to submit it i was reading the guidelines just right now
[16:57:05] <mathRand> Z3R0, it could be customized with "lambda" functions, or anything you want
[16:57:08] <coldhead> you've already got the code on github so you're most of the way there
[16:58:24] <mathRand> coldhead, yeah i guess so, i will upload it, i hope it'll be of good value to people, to me it is a central part in an application i've created so i thought it might help someone
[16:58:45] <Z3R0> I'm still learning on how to create plugins lol
[16:58:55] <Z3R0> never really understood the concept, but know I need to learn
[16:59:31] <LaMakina> mathRand, i could be using your code on a daily basis myself. so i'm sure people will find it valuable.
[17:00:18] <mathRand> LaMakina, i'm glad you think so, that means a lot to me to know i am helping someone with my code :D
[17:02:21] <coldhead> Z3R0: all you really need to know is $.fn.pluginName and return this;
[17:02:56] <Z3R0> yea
[17:03:03] <Z3R0> is there a way to incorporate other plugins within your own ?
[17:03:04] <mathRand> i thought Z3R0 was being sarcastic lol
[17:03:12] <Z3R0> no I wasn't sorry lol I was serious
[17:03:17] <Z3R0> I'm actually reading a tutorial atm
[17:03:17] <mathRand> i apologize then
[17:03:43] <gnarf> coldhead: nice to see you ;)
[17:03:59] <Z3R0> ^ question if you guys get a chance?
[17:04:22] <gnarf> what do you mean by that? your plugin can depend on another plugin
[17:04:30] <gnarf> and / or extend another plugin
[17:04:31] <Z3R0> and use the plugin
[17:04:50] <Z3R0> like for instance (example not real), blockUI is a plugin I know
[17:04:57] <gnarf> you just have to instruct users how to install the other plugin first then include yours
[17:04:59] <mathRand> the way i see jQuery plugins is that they are a better way to orgnize your code syntax and namespace wise ...
[17:04:59] <Z3R0> can I use $.blockUI in my code?
[17:05:14] <gnarf> Z3R0: ^^^
[17:05:25] <Z3R0> well it's probably not something I would release, just something easier for me
[17:05:26] <gnarf> that last statement answered the question you asked after ;)
[17:05:40] <gnarf> but yeah, use anything you have included
[17:05:41] <gnarf> :)
[17:05:49] <Z3R0> neato as long as it's included prior to the other right ?
[17:06:06] <Z3R0> has to "exist" before use
[17:07:08] <gnarf> s/before use/before the code that needs the plugin runs
[17:07:13] <gnarf> so like
[17:07:18] <gnarf> if the blockui is in an event handler
[17:07:25] <gnarf> that wont be triggered til after the plugin loads
[17:07:32] <gnarf> it might be able to be included after
[17:07:33] <gnarf> but usually
[17:07:39] <gnarf> best to put a dependency first
[17:07:40] <gnarf> :)
[17:07:51] <Z3R0> guess I got a lot of reading to do lol
[17:08:04] <coldhead> half your luck
[17:08:09] <Z3R0> lol
[17:10:40] <abjorn> i tell you h'wut
[17:10:56] <Z3R0> question: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff608209.aspx // following that, it says you can make the defaultOptions is that outside the original plugin funciton? or within it ?
[17:11:28] <Z3R0> oh nvm
[17:11:35] <Z3R0> I looked at binder code and saw how he did it
[17:15:20] <abjorn> I learned today that my team lead apparently has a violent distaste for .then
[17:21:25] <shoky> but but
[17:38:02] <sheilablackrose> hi guys can anyone take  alook at this function and tell me what it does? http://jsfiddle.net/Ue3JZ/
[17:39:07] <Gazpacho> which function, why is there code in the display panel
[17:40:42] <sheilablackrose> i really dont know not use to jsfiddle
[17:40:42] <Gazpacho> whatever it's doing, it's doing the wrong way
[17:40:48] <sheilablackrose> but thats th efunction im having problem with
[17:40:55] <sheilablackrose> need to understand what it does in order to fix it
[17:43:10] <sheilablackrose> Gazpacho - does $('<div/>').append(script).appendTo(document.body); would append <div></div> to the page?
[17:43:44] <Gazpacho> it appends a div that contains the script
[17:44:13] <sheilablackrose> something like <div>some script </div> right
[17:44:27] <Z3R0> are there any servers that simulate ajax requests rather than having to have your own setup? lol
[17:44:35] <Gazpacho> if you want to extract scripts from HTML, then use a selector already
[17:44:43] <Gazpacho> don't use regexes
[17:44:46] <coldhead> streetlights as fairgrounds
[17:44:52] <Foxhoundz> Z3R0: just request a page you already have in your server
[17:44:57] <Foxhoundz> Z3R0: i.e. tests.json
[17:45:06] <Foxhoundz> or whatever other type of return you want
[17:45:44] <sheilablackrose> my problem is that is appending a whole lot of empty <div></div> in th epage
[17:46:01] <sheilablackrose> so i could just do this to fix it right? $(document.body).append(script);
[17:47:19] <Gazpacho> sheila: ah, well that's because jquery doesn't really insert script elements when you tell it to. It evaluates them, for IE compatibility reasons
[17:48:23] <sheilablackrose> ic
[17:48:32] <sheilablackrose> so my fix would work without causing issues?
[17:48:49] <coldhead> i think you're always going to cause issues, sheilablackrose
[17:48:52] <Gazpacho> you cannot use jquery to prevent the browser from executing scripts elements it has already received
[17:48:52] <coldhead> it's in your nature
[17:49:04] <sheilablackrose> so sweet words coldhead:)
[17:49:06] <sheilablackrose> as usual
[17:49:09] <Gazpacho> scripts it has already received
[17:49:22] <sheilablackrose> ic
[17:49:29] <sheilablackrose> thanks Gazpacho
[17:49:39] <Gazpacho> if only we knew just what your goal was for writing such a function
[17:49:51] <sheilablackrose> how are you coldhead? i think ive been quiet lately.miss me?
[17:50:04] <sheilablackrose> Gazpacho is not my function im working on a project that has an issue with it
[17:58:23] <sheilablackrose> thanks guys
[17:58:25] <sheilablackrose> c ya
[17:58:42] <coldhead> bye forever, sheilablackrose
[17:59:09] <echoee> that's a sad goodbye
[18:01:10] <tw2113> you are all...weirdos
[18:01:54] <coldhead> that's rich coming from you
[18:01:58] <coldhead> oh sorry, wrong window
[18:02:15] <tw2113> :)
[18:03:19] <abjorn> every goodbye is tearful with coldhead
[18:05:19] <tw2113> i dunno abjorn
[18:05:30] <Z3R0> how do you get a plugin to respond standalone without an element?
[18:05:33] <tw2113> i heard coldhead lost the ability to feel in the great browser war at the turn of the millenium
[18:05:36] <beliveyourdream> hi all .. if i have a variable collectionHolder that stores the data-prototype of a form which is formed of a <label> and a <div> ... how can i remove the label from it ?
[18:05:38] <Z3R0> $.this vs $(selector).this
[18:07:11] <beliveyourdream> anyone please ?
[18:08:43] <abjorn> tw2113: no, no, you're getting that confused with his long term memory. Coldhead lost his long term memory. That's why every day is his first day and every goodbye is forever
[18:08:58] <tw2113> *mind splosion*
[18:09:38] <tw2113> it's like a nerd's 50 First Dates
[18:10:51] <abjorn> and without the dates
[18:12:07] <Z3R0> I'm just fiddling with plugin crap, and I have something like... $('.test').clicky();
[18:12:15] <Z3R0> but my clicky() is triggering on EVERYTHING
[18:14:16] <beliveyourdream> can anyone help me with this ? http://jsfiddle.net/L8qmP/
[18:14:38] <jdelgado> @beliveyourdream what is your question
[18:14:56] <beliveyourdream> jdelgado: how do i remove the first element from the collectionHolder
[18:15:29] <beliveyourdream> because when i click the delete link .. the label always remains there and it shouldn't
[18:17:43] <jdelgado> well thought looking at your code, I would say $('#collectionHolder').child(':first').remove() - did that not work?
[18:18:19] <jdelgado> *correction children instead of child
[18:19:18] <beliveyourdream> jdelgado: doesn't seem like it works
[18:19:33] <beliveyourdream> and btw .. collectionHolder is a variable not an id
[18:20:39] <Rchristiani> Wondering if I could get some help, fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/tqDQ6/2/ I have some text you would click and boxes of images would fade out and then only the selected would fade in, however the first time you do it, it works fine. When you do it again, it does a lot of flashing, any tips on why it is doing this?
[18:21:10] <v0lksman> hello all! is there a way to know what direction .toggle went?  (IE hide or show)
[18:22:06] <jdelgado> @beliiveyourdream what kind of variable? You just have to specify your container, then reference .children(':first') then do something like remove()
[18:22:14] <Rchristiani> @v0lksman, maybe check to see if the element you are toggeling is hidden or not?
[18:22:15] <mathRand> v0lksman, $(selector).is(":visible") == true might help you :)
[18:22:37] <Gazpacho> v0lksman: where do you need to know?
[18:22:49] <Gazpacho> please don't compare to true in vain
[18:22:53] <beliveyourdream> jdelgado: look at the fiddle .. i'm storing the value of a data-prototype in a variable collectionHolder
[18:23:41] <beliveyourdream> http://jsfiddle.net/L8qmP/
[18:24:40] <v0lksman> I may have figured out what I need. is(':visible') was an option but I had it checking the wrong element... :)
[18:24:51] <beliveyourdream> jdelgado: you can see that if you click add company and then delete company ... there's a label that doesn't get deleted ... because i can't really catch it ... so i have to remove before creating the form
[18:25:09] <Gazpacho> thanks byd you just made me gouge my eyes out, i'm literally blind now
[18:25:23] <jdelgado> @rchristiani You are fading in things that aren't there, then you are removing the other ones, that it why it is all wonky. It works as coded though?
[18:26:12] <mathRand> wow! what is this code @ jsfiddle?
[18:26:50] <Rchristiani> @jdelgado Well I guess fading out thigns that are not there, out, a check is needed then I think, it works the first time, not the second time around
[18:27:31] <mathRand> beliveyourdream, how are you going to maintain this code?
[18:27:48] <mathRand> is it server side generated?
[18:27:57] <beliveyourdream> mathRand: it's generated .. i just pasted the output so i can put it in fiddle
[18:28:04] <jdelgado> @rchirstiani Yeah, when you fadeout things that aren't present - it makes it visible, then removes them again. That's why you are having your issues. Do a check .is(':visible') and only fade if needed?
[18:28:17] <mathRand> beliveyourdream, yeah i thought so!
[18:28:41] <Rchristiani> @jdelgado: yup, that makes sense, thanks
[18:35:48] <jdelgado> @rchristiani No problem, glad to help.
[18:36:40] <beliveyourdream> so no ideea on how can i do that ?
[18:37:10] <sample001>  hello there, why is that when you want to view a big image the whole image cannot be viewed automatically ? i mean sometimes only the half of the image will show and slowly it will become bigger until the whole image will be displayed .Is there any way to prevent it ?
[18:37:50] <cincyguy5646> it's better to provide examples to support your question
[18:38:31] <jdelgado> @sample001 It is caused by a large image being basically streamed to the browser, and it is displaying it as it is being downloaded. You can make it smaller to load faster, or do some really complex stuff to pre-load it then display it, but that it how the internet works.
[18:39:40] <ionico> have any of you know how to close a window of jquery boxy plug in?
[18:40:08] <sample001> jdelgado: thanks
[18:40:16] <tsheva> @sample001 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/263359/how-can-i-determine-if-an-image-has-loaded-using-javascript-jquery
[18:40:24] <jdelgado> @sample001 No problem, sorry I can't help more than that.
[18:40:27] <tsheva> you can just call the method onload
[18:41:23] <tsheva> @sample001 it is better if you put an eventlistener instead of using onload cause it would only work for ie
[18:41:41] <jdelgado> @tsheva I'd recommend against that, simply because things like that can glitch very easily, leading to the image not being displayed at all.
[18:42:25] <sample001> so what do you think is the best thing to do ?
[18:42:41] <tsheva> @jdelgado how you mean by that ? Did you mean the image will not be loaded properly ? i never tried with image but i tried iframe and worked just fine for me in all of modern browsers
[18:43:42] <jdelgado> @tsheva What happens is - the image loads, and isn't displayed until that script is triggered. If the script doesn't accuratly calculate hight (which is how it works), the image won't ever be displayed. It's just bound to glitch.
[18:44:01] <jdelgado> @sample001 I'd leave it alone, read above. Most internet users recognize that images must load.
[18:44:01] <b-ot> jdelgado: leaveitalo.ne - ☹☺ MAYBE!
[18:44:47] <jdelgado> heh, cute bots.
[18:45:23] <cincyguy5646> ionico  make sure to use the closeable constructor option and also specify a title
[18:46:04] <tsheva> @jdelgado got what you mean cause for the iframe i sent the height and width from the iframe to the parent
[18:47:03] <jdelgado> @tsheva I think you're misunderstanding me. That script calculates the height of the image while it is loading to determine if it is fully loaded. Nothing to do with iframes - it doesn't trigger the event until the heights match, which may not work as expected.
[18:49:24] <tsheva> @jdelgado oh you mean the stackoverflow site
[18:49:32] <tsheva> @jdelgado how about this ? http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_img_onload.asp
[18:49:37] <jdelgado> @tsheava Correct :)
[18:50:31] <cincyguy5646> http://www.w3fools.com
[18:50:40] <jdelgado> That would work
[18:50:44] <jdelgado> Good call
[18:51:16] <jdelgado> lol @cincyguy5646 he's just trying to throw an example, leave him alone. :)
[18:51:58] <tsheva> i guess with jquery you can just do $(image).load(function(){})
[18:52:34] <cincyguy5646> just spraying the lysol after a stink link jdel :)
[18:52:35] <jdelgado> not at all, you would have to do what you referenced, then have that call a seperate function
[18:53:35] <tsheva> @cincyguy5646 i dont get it how u mean stink link ?
[18:54:09] <jdelgado> W3schools is generally frowned upon
[18:54:13] <beliveyourdream> ok i'll simplify the problem .. i have an html string like '<label>label</label><div>content<div>' how do i remove the <label> element from it ? but just the first one in case there are others inside the div ???
[18:54:38] <jdelgado> as a 'noob' website, but you were just referencing it, so you're good. :)
[18:55:16] <cincyguy5646> $('label:first').remove();
[18:56:02] <tsheva> oh i see thanks jdelgado
[18:56:20] <beliveyourdream> cincyguy5646: ok i forgot to say the string is in a var prototype for example. .. how can i do it from the var ?
[18:56:24] <jdelgado> @tsheva No worries :)
[18:57:08] <jdelgado> @beliveyourdream are you attempting to modify a string, or the DOM?
[18:57:26] <tsheva> prolly regular expression ?
[18:57:26] <beliveyourdream> jdelgado: a string which is stored in a var
[18:58:23] <beliveyourdream> the html string is not in the dom at that point where i need to remove the label
[18:58:24] <jdelgado> Jquery is meant as a DOM solution, not to screw around with strings. Additionally, I would use a templating engine rather than trying to manipulate html with strings.
[18:58:59] <cincyguy5646> i'm with jdel on this one
[18:59:24] <beliveyourdream> jdelgado: yeah i can modify the template that generates the code but if it's possible to do it with jquery in like 5 lines .. i prefer that instead of like 100 for overwriting the template
[18:59:26] <jdelgado> It's a terrible practice to balance strings
[18:59:40] <jdelgado> Use Regex then
[19:00:28] <farid2003> hi, i'm try add row table with jquery using prepend command. the problem is when I calling function from it, always echoing text undefined and if I add return command like "return true" it's echoing "true"
[19:00:45] <farid2003> here jsfiddle url http://jsfiddle.net/STaZr/
[19:01:23] <samu1241> wah ada orang indo jg nih ternyata :D
[19:01:51] <farid2003> the function loadCombo is load dynamic combobox from database
[19:02:01] <jdelgado> @farid2003 You are running loadCmbo that doesn't return any value
[19:02:51] <No_one_at_all> Hi, can somebody tell me where I can find and download the jquery ui documentation? Perhaps like this: https://github.com/jqapi/jqapi ? I find <<-- that one awesome.
[19:03:03] <jdelgado> @fairid2003 Look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/STaZr/1/ - I returned a variable and it works. If it doesn't return a variable, then it isn't defined.
[19:03:22] <jdelgado> @no_one_at_all why do you want to download it?
[19:03:36] <No_one_at_all> jdelgado I have spotty internet, so I need to be able to read it offline
[19:03:59] <No_one_at_all> jdelgado: also that one by hashrocket is pretty cool, with its searchable features and demos
[19:04:16] <jdelgado> @no_one_at_all I guess you can go to http://api.jqueryui.com/ and print each page as a pdf..?
[19:04:30] <No_one_at_all> well, sure I could do that.
[19:04:44] <cincyguy5646> or save the pages on the site for offline access
[19:04:51] <jdelgado> Indeed
[19:05:02] <No_one_at_all> I could also stick my head in a garbage disposal. Hasn't anyone compiled the documentation together?
[19:05:12] <cincyguy5646> that sounds fun!
[19:05:23] <maxme> A JSON version of the docs could actually be kinda useful.
[19:05:31] <jdelgado> Dude, if you're going to ask for help, you don't have to be a tool...
[19:05:31] <tsheva> @no_one_at_all you might be the first one
[19:05:45] <cincyguy5646> i have the documentation on my phone as an app you can read while you poop
[19:05:54] <jdelgado> lmao
[19:06:11] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to auto-center this .box - but can't seem to get it to work. Any suggestions? http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/FsJHU/
[19:06:20] <No_one_at_all> tsheva: I doubt it, when I type "jquery ui documentation" into google, it adds "pdf", so I know lots of people have searched for this
[19:06:37] <No_one_at_all> cincyguy5646 also, gimme that app. My pooping could benefit from documentation perusal
[19:06:45] <tw2113> radiantstatic, add margin: 0 auto;
[19:07:10] <danlozano> warup
[19:08:06] <radiantstatic> tw2113: looking to center via means of jquery for other purposes. my code doesn't seem to be completing and not sure why.
[19:10:26] <tsheva> @radiantstatic css('width') not css(width)
[19:10:28] <tw2113> use .css to set the left and right margin to auto then
[19:10:38] <jdelgado> @radiantstatic remove all of your javascript and add margin: 0 auto; to your box css as tw2113 suggested.
[19:10:55] <cincyguy5646> and the winner is... CSS
[19:11:12] <jdelgado> Why on earth would you want to center with jquery?
[19:11:22] <radiantstatic> tsheva: Thank you
[19:11:23] <jdelgado> Just wondering
[19:11:24] <danlozano> some dynamic stuff I guess
[19:11:36] <jdelgado> CSS is dynamic.. lol
[19:11:49] <danlozano> Like he wants something to be centered WHEN something happens :)
[19:11:52] <danlozano> dynamically
[19:11:58] <radiantstatic> because I have content that is off center due to a logo, so instead of centering with CSS which would actually not center the layout, i need to do some math.
[19:12:03] <danlozano> Nevermind
[19:12:05] <danlozano> haha
[19:12:15] <jdelgado> heh
[19:12:39] <tsheva> speaking of dynamic and responsive can someone give me feedback on this jquery plugin ? http://www.jresponsive.is-great.net/#top
[19:12:49] <jdelgado> I'd just use css and change the left margin to a pixel amount you like
[19:13:01] <radiantstatic> I can imagine that there is more than one reason someone would go about centering something. But that's just me!
[19:13:43] <jdelgado> @tsheva that actually is a really useful plugin, I might use that on a project
[19:13:58] <tsheva> thanks jdelgado
[19:14:12] <jdelgado> I assume the delay is configurable?
[19:14:17] <cincyguy5646_> looks like a codewriting saver to me tshev
[19:15:20] <tsheva> @jdelgado the delay ?
[19:16:25] <jdelgado> I'd throw a setting to customize the speed in which it goes - that is a tad slow for my taste. Past that, looks really good!
[19:16:40] <jdelgado> @tsheva ^
[19:17:37] <danlozano> @tsheva nice !
[19:18:15] <tsheva> @jdelgado good call sir well since i used animate so i supposed i could add an option into the plugin
[19:18:22] <tsheva> @danlozano thanks
[19:18:35] <jdelgado> :)
[19:25:14] <tsheva> @radiantstatic i think i found out the problem the .css('width') return a string thats why it doesnt work
[19:25:37] <tsheva> @radiantstatic another thing is you should use settimeout for resize event
[19:28:06] <farid2003> jdelgado: actually the function loadCombo is return html select box. here : http://pastie.org/7625351
[19:29:21] <coldhead> superheroes of BMX
[19:30:47] <farid2003> the return value always shown to the row. question how can I get rid from it ?
[19:31:06] <farid2003> jdelgado: the return value always shown to the row. question how can I get rid from it ?
[19:32:14] <farid2003> samu1241 : hehe, salam kenal pak.
[19:32:44] <coldhead> greetings pak
[19:32:51] <samu1241> farid2003 : salam kenal jg pak :D
[19:37:46] <tsheva> anyone here interested in neural network for javascript ?
[19:38:18] <jdelgado> Is that a thing now?
[19:38:45] <cincyguy5646_> what is it
[19:40:04] <tsheva> http://www.heatonresearch.com/
[19:40:23] <tsheva> AI lately i am totally haunted by it
[19:41:17] <jdelgado> skynet man
[19:41:29] <jdelgado> this is how it all starts
[19:42:11] <tsheva> :) terminator
[19:42:28] <jdelgado> indeed
[19:43:17] <tsheva> so i think the way mobile devices handle text input for web form is kinda annoying so i am trying to research about this neural network and create a plugin out of it
[19:43:42] <tsheva> if you ever used myscript you would know what i mean
[19:51:23] <juboba> I'm trying to do:         data = "nothing still"; $.get('some_file.txt', function(data){ contents = data; } console.log(contents);      but this shows "nothing still" instead of the file contents. How can I solve this problem?
[19:51:58] <juboba> its an environment problem
[19:52:21] <tsheva> how u mean by that juboba ?
[19:52:30] <jdelgado> juboba: I'm willing to bet a large sum of money that you either aren't waiting for the async function to finish, or you cannot get the file correctly.
[19:52:53] <jdelgado> move the console.log into the function and try it - does it work?
[19:53:08] <juboba> yes
[19:53:21] <jdelgado> boom!
[19:53:22] <juboba> but I need to do it sync
[19:53:28] <juboba> not async
[19:53:31] <juboba> thanks
[19:53:33] <juboba> ;)
[19:53:40] <jdelgado> Well, unfortunatly, you chose a programing language that does everything async... lol
[19:53:43] <tsheva> @jdelgado :D nice
[19:53:44] <b-ot> tsheva: nice.com - ☹ TAKEN
[19:54:16] <coldhead> you probably don't really need it to be synchronous
[19:54:25] <jdelgado> The best thing you can do is make a callback, so it will run evrything you need after it is done.
[19:54:36] <coldhead> yes, that would be the Proper Way
[19:54:46] <juboba> colhead I'm modifying the Kite script
[19:56:44] <juboba> What I'm trying to accomplish:  <script id="myid" type="text/myownlanguage" src="myfile.mylang"></script> ....  var the_file = document.getElementById('myid').loadFile();
[19:56:54] <juboba> I have the first script tag in my html
[19:57:20] <juboba> and I want to load the contents of the file specified on the src attribute
[19:57:33] <juboba> I was kinda counting on the browser to load it
[19:57:36] <juboba> and I think it does
[19:57:45] <juboba> but how can I get access to that data?
[19:58:00] <juboba> (this way I wouldn't need to do another request)
[19:59:56] <jdelgado> juboba: Whats the problem?
[20:00:09] <jdelgado> You load it...? What is the question?
[20:00:24] <juboba> If you have this: <script id="myid" type="text/myownlanguage" src="myfile.mylang"></script>
[20:00:26] <coldhead> all the buildings i have loved
[20:00:31] <juboba> how can you get the contents of the file?
[20:00:39] <juboba> I know the broswer requested the file
[20:00:47] <juboba> but I don't know where it got loaded
[20:00:58] <tw2113> memory
[20:01:08] <tw2113> cache
[20:01:13] <juboba> ?
[20:01:17] <tw2113> functions defined in it can now be used
[20:01:24] <juboba> I know
[20:01:31] <juboba> but there's no functions in it
[20:01:31] <tw2113> thus it's loaded
[20:01:35] <tw2113> what's in it
[20:01:39] <juboba> there is just xml
[20:02:01] <juboba> I want to get the contents of the tag via the id attribute
[20:02:02] <tw2113> not sure that's the purpose of the script tag
[20:03:36] <juboba> check this out: https://code.google.com/p/kite/
[20:03:48] <jdelgado> Just throwing it out there. It is a horrible idea to dynamically load javascript. You're just asking for exploits.
[20:04:13] <juboba> jdelgado, it's not javascript
[20:04:33] <jdelgado> What is it then?
[20:04:37] <tw2113> xml
[20:04:45] <jdelgado> Well don't load it as a script
[20:04:51] <jdelgado> save it as a variable
[20:04:53] <juboba> I'm modifying the Kite script so that instead of saying <script id="hello">   <h1>{{myvar}}</h1>     </script>
[20:04:56] <jdelgado> then process it
[20:05:01] <juboba> I can have the contents in a new file
[20:05:22] <jdelgado> why would you want to do that
[20:05:38] <juboba> to have separate files for templates
[20:05:45] <tw2113> how is this jQuery related?
[20:05:52] <juboba> dang
[20:05:58] <juboba> thought it was javascript
[20:06:01] <juboba> sorry
[20:06:29] <teewuane> juboba: sounds like django
[20:06:32] <jdelgado> why cant you just include the templates in the original page at load time?
[20:06:44] <juboba> teewuane, it's not, please read the page
[20:06:45] <jdelgado> I'm either really tierd and my mind is going, or this makes no sense.
[20:07:00] <tw2113> that kite thing is javascript juboba
[20:07:03] <tw2113> but it's not jquery
[20:07:07] <jdelgado> use handlebars
[20:07:19] <juboba> thanks

[20:22:01] <altin> jdelgado: ?
[20:22:19] <jdelgado> hah, I meant I will answer it, but only if you promise to accept my answer, so I get rep
[20:22:46] <altin> jdelgado: sure
[20:22:49] <coldhead> good grief man, rep is worthless as a woman's love
[20:22:59] <jdelgado> THAT WAS THE JOKE

[20:25:07] <farid2003> oo my bad, sorry I'm not update jsfiddle
[20:25:42] <farid2003> http://jsfiddle.net/STaZr/7/
[20:25:45] <farid2003> now update
[20:26:14] <jdelgado> altin: Ok, so you just want to remove the hash from the location?
[20:26:39] <farid2003> coldhead sorry can you cek again
[20:26:39] <altin> jdelgado: the hash and the div id after it when the fancybox pops up
[20:26:47] <altin> but I don't want to reload the page
[20:26:57] <JoseffB> hi all
[20:27:36] <jdelgado> altin: Do you have this live somewhere so I can test?
[20:27:47] <altin> nope jdelgado
[20:27:50] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/STaZr/8/
[20:27:56] <coldhead> hey we want our violence doubled
[20:28:09] <jdelgado> altin: k i'll test it, sec
[20:29:22] <farid2003> coldhead: ah, thanks you very much
[20:29:41] <jdelgado> altin: replied - let me know if that doesn't work.
[20:29:52] <jdelgado> altin: your underscore didn't work
[20:30:46] <altin> jdelgado: well if I leave it blank the # still stays in the url
[20:30:57] <altin> and despite that the page scrolls at the very top
[20:31:01] <altin> after closing fancybox
[20:31:09] <altin> that is not convenient...
[20:31:15] <jdelgado> altin: Oh - there isn't anyway to remove the anchor once it is there without reloading the page
[20:31:15] <altin> in my case
[20:31:24] <altin> I see
[20:31:34] <jdelgado> altin: I thought you just wanted to get rid of the text
[20:31:56] <jdelgado> The hash tells the page not to reload, so anything without that will invoke a reload
[20:33:13] <jdelgado> altin: are you still in irc?
[20:33:33] * coldhead adds more hot water
[20:33:50] <altin> jdelgado: yes, I understand
[20:34:03] <jdelgado> You can try doing window.history.pushState('page', 'Title', '/page2.html'); - which will force one into the history
[20:34:37] <farid2003> coldhead: how if I add another row ? the number start from begining

[20:39:11] <jdelgado> did the history thing work altin?
[20:39:14] <JoseffB> glaksmono_ are you linking hte src file right?
[20:39:43] <altin> jdelgado: I didn't try it
[20:39:49] <altin> ill use " " with a space
[20:39:56] <altin> so that the page doesn't scroll up
[20:39:57] <altin> g2g
[20:41:07] <coldhead> farid2003: http://jsfiddle.net/STaZr/9/ something like that
[20:41:32] <coldhead> farid2003: you should use underscore templates or something, rather than put all that horrible HTML in your JS
[20:41:55] <jdelgado> altin adios
[20:42:04] <glaksmono_> JosseffB: yeah
[20:42:09] <coldhead> bye forever
[20:42:17] <farid2003> o thanks coldhead
[20:42:18] <coldhead> break it down and start again
[20:42:24] <glaksmono_> jdelgado: try to download and run it, and see if that works for u
[20:42:46] <glaksmono_> JoseffB: try to download and run it and see if that works for u
[20:42:55] <farid2003> oo ok. thanks for your advice too

[20:44:20] <JoseffB> there has got to be a better way
[20:44:30] <glaksmono_> anyone know what's up with scrollTop() on chrome?
[20:44:34] <glaksmono_> for some reason i keep getting 0
[20:45:03] <momomomomo> JoseffB: git & github/bitbucket?
[20:45:08] <coldhead> glaksmono_: what's the selector?
[20:45:23] <coldhead> i have had to use $('html,body').scrollTop() to get it to work sometimes
[20:45:39] <JoseffB> momomomomo: yea but dont want to publish the these projects
[20:46:10] <momomomomo> did you even check out bitbucket's site?
[20:46:25] <coldhead> clearly not
[20:46:27] <JoseffB> i know bitbucket
[20:46:35] <JoseffB> hmm
[20:46:46] <JoseffB> maybe thinking something differen
[20:47:08] <momomomomo> coldhead: why is your room so bright
[20:47:18] <glaksmono_> coldhead: it's a div container for the image loadin
[20:47:27] <glaksmono_> i want to call an ajax request when it reaches the bottom
[20:47:39] <glaksmono_> and i've been unable to do scrollTop
[20:47:50] <coldhead> it works fine in my imagination, glaksmono_
[20:47:53] <JoseffB> tlast time I checked out mercurial it onlyhad mercurial :) thisis awesome
[20:47:55] <coldhead> you got a demo somewhere?
[20:48:22] <JoseffB> momomomomo thanks for the heads up
[20:48:46] <momomomomo> no problem
[20:48:56] <owzzz> Anyone good with Regex? trying to find a string with a param ?wid=200 and  replace it with ?wid=300
[20:49:14] <owzzz> .replace(/wid=[0-9]/, "wid=300")
[20:49:24] <JoseffB> whoa I'm repeating my words lol must be really tired
[20:49:53] <momomomomo> wouldn't that be wid=[0-9]+
[20:49:54] <momomomomo> ?
[20:50:35] <coldhead> if it's always 200 -> 300 you can do str replace, no regex required
[20:50:39] <coldhead> now you have 0 problems
[20:51:07] <owzzz> .replace(/wid=[0-9]+/, "wid=900")
[20:51:09] <owzzz> this worked
[20:51:12] <owzzz> thank you
[20:52:16] <momomomomo> no problem owzzz check out http://rubular.com/ (I know it's not js specific, but much of the same applies)
[20:52:56] <coldhead> WAKE UP SHEEPLE
[20:53:03] <coldhead> sorry wrong window
[20:53:26] <coldhead> .replace(/wid=\d+/, "wid=900")

[21:56:47] <arthurervas> hello?
[21:56:54] <arthurervas> need some helo on my code
[21:56:58] <arthurervas> help*
[21:57:08] <ionico> just ask
[21:57:38] <coldhead> spirit is telling me to check out line 17
[21:58:07] <arthurervas> http://jsfiddle.net/hajNA/ -> i need the function loadedImage return the i with the same value from for inside init function
[21:59:03] <Cork> return i; ?
[21:59:22] <arthurervas> i is returning with the last value from the for
[21:59:42] <Cork> arthurervas: i think you're missing the problem though
[21:59:43] <arthurervas> i is returning with the last value from the for loop*
[22:00:07] <Cork> 1. i is global; 2. i is shared for all the loops; 3. reloadimage can be async
[22:00:54] <arthurervas> how to turn i not global ?
[22:00:57] <Cork> $.each(t, function(ti, i) {});
[22:01:07] <tudda|awy> I am having some trouble with unobtrusive validation + dynamic Content.  I've outlined the core of my problem in this pastebin : http://pastebin.com/Fzf4dYiy    I have Firebug and EventBug installed, but I'm just not sure how to diagnose it from here
[22:01:08] <Cork> arthurervas: by declaring your variable
[22:01:21] <Cork> ah sorry missed it on the line above
[22:01:25] <Cork> so scratch 1
[22:01:37] <Cork> arthurervas: but 2 and 3 is still true
[22:02:01] <Cork> for each loop in the for i is changed, and all the code share this value
[22:02:14] <Cork> and then the callbacks trigger with the last value in i
[22:02:43] <arthurervas> how to make the callbacks not get the last value, but the actually value ?
[22:03:13] <Cork> buy making a scope and having each scope have it's own copy of i
[22:03:19] <Cork> $.each does this by default
[22:03:40] <Cork> for() { (function() { var i2 = i; })() } is another option
[22:03:49] <Cork> (and then using i2)
[22:05:08] <arthurervas> var i2 not worked, returning always "2", strange
[22:05:11] <Cork> arthurervas: the problem is; that with your original code, loadedImage inherit the scope of init, and all loadedImage function inharit the same scope
[22:05:15] <arthurervas> i'll try each
[22:05:26] <Cork> you can't just use var =
[22:05:29] <Cork> you need a scope
[22:05:40] <Cork> so (function() {})() is needed if you do it in a for loop
[22:05:54] <Cork> as if you don't all the calls share a scope
[22:06:05] <Cork> and by that only have one instance of i
[22:07:44] <arthurervas> sorry, dont know i understand because i'm not a js ninja...
[22:08:18] <Cork> arthurervas: you know how inherited scope works in js?
[22:09:03] <Cork> scope is normally the same as functions
[22:09:06] <arthurervas> not much
[22:09:25] <Cork> a scope can access variables defined in its parent scope
[22:09:51] <Cork> so function a() { var c = 1; function b() { return c; } } b can access c
[22:10:35] <Cork> for doesn't create a scope so that means the variable change "globally" for that wrapping scope
[22:10:47] <Cork> normally this is fine
[22:11:10] <Cork> but async executes after a loop has completely finished
[22:11:38] <Cork> so that means that the callbacks queue, and while the callbacks queue the parent scope variable change (i)
[22:12:00] <Cork> and when the init function ends the callbacks is called one at a time with the value of i
[22:12:10] <Cork> but as the for loop has ended, i is at the end
[22:12:30] <Cork> so to solve that you define one scope for each iteration of the for loop
[22:12:43] <Cork> and the simplest way to create a scope in js is (function() {})()
[22:12:57] <Cork> and if you define a variable inside that it will be local for that scope
[22:13:22] <Cork> and that's why i said do: for() { (function() { var i2 = i; })() } or $.each
[22:13:30] <Cork> as they both basically do the same thing
[22:14:39] <Cork> (there is flashier way to do the same thing, but it also makes it a bit more confusing so i skip that)
[22:15:14] <arthurervas> nice! $.each worked for me. let me try with "for() function" to know if i got it
[22:19:59] <nesoi> so what event is best to use for mobile? I am currently using tap but read somewhere that vclick was better. OTOH, I tried replacing tap with vclick and it didnt work
[22:20:28] <arthurervas> is this correct now? http://jsfiddle.net/hajNA/1/
[22:21:00] <Cork> arthurervas: yes that would make i2 uniq for each loadedImage
[22:21:25] <arthurervas> the () makes the function to auto execute, thats it ?
[22:21:30] <Cork> yes
[22:21:42] <arthurervas> thanks a lot!
[22:21:43] <Cork> arthurervas: alternatively you can pass i to reloadImage, and have it pass it to the callback
[22:21:51] <Cork> it would give the same effect
[22:22:24] <Cork> arthurervas: http://jsfiddle.net/hajNA/2/
[22:22:27] <Cork> opps
[22:22:40] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/hajNA/3/
[22:23:13] <Cork> (cause the preloadImage would act as the separate scope)
[22:23:35] <sreekumarp34> hi

[22:55:18] <skyjumper> so the selector in a $.on() can match a parent element of the element that triggered it?
[22:55:21] <Cork> so it should trigger quiz-question
[22:55:37] <Cork> as long as stopPropagation isn't called yes
[22:56:18] <skyjumper> that seems counterintuitive... i'm telling it to match events for .quiz-question
[22:56:28] <skyjumper> why would i want it to match events that happen on .quiz-question's children?
[22:56:30] <Cork> yes, and the event matches
[22:56:44] <Cork> cause that's how events work
[22:56:55] <skyjumper> i was hoping that wasn't the case
[22:56:57] * skyjumper grumbles
[22:57:07] <Cork> skyjumper: if you want to be explicit use event.target
[22:57:22] <gnarf> um
[22:57:30] <skyjumper> then i need the event handler to test the event.target
[22:58:03] <Cork> skyjumper: http://jsfiddle.net/7vV2b/2/
[22:58:22] <Cork> damn, forgot to remove the dot
[22:58:25] <gnarf> skyjumper: the e.target is always going to be what was clicked on
[22:58:32] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/7vV2b/3/
[22:58:34] <gnarf> the selector just catches it on the bubble
[22:58:38] <gnarf> look at e.currentTarget ?
[22:58:53] <skyjumper> i know e.target will be the element that triggered the event
[22:59:06] <Cork> gnarf: he don't want the bubble match
[22:59:15] <skyjumper> i was hoping the selector in $.on() could be used to filter exactly the trigger element
[22:59:30] <Cork> skyjumper: that would break most expectations
[22:59:32] <gnarf> nope, you generally wouldn't want this
[22:59:37] <Cork> ya
[22:59:56] <Cork> its simple to fix though
[23:00:02] <gnarf> you can be explicit with a .is/return like cork suggested
[23:00:13] <skyjumper> that's one option
[23:00:24] <skyjumper> realistically i need to rework the whole thing i'm trying to do
[23:00:45] <skyjumper> knowing is half the battle
[23:01:25] <coldhead> magazines, the daily post \ unread but understood
[23:01:40] <gnarf> though you make me wonder if there is a real use case/way to tie that into .on()
[23:04:09] <nathanbz> anyone know a good logging tool for recording form fillin in rates
[23:04:15] <skyjumper> yeah if you could specify like, $("form").on('test-event', true, function() { ... }), where the 'true' indicates you want to match only the e.target element
[23:04:16] <nathanbz> eg I would like to know if ppl file in the first 2 fields then leave the page
[23:04:28] <skyjumper> and not descendents
[23:04:31] <skyjumper> that would be useful
[23:05:56] <abhas> from where can i learn all about the element selection process?
[23:06:12] <gnarf> nathanbz: you could probably do this with google analytics and sending custom events to it
[23:06:19] <Cork> abhas: what part is it you want to know?
[23:06:46] <gnarf> abhas: ? it's not much of a process, you pass a css selector, it returns you stuff
[23:06:52] <gnarf> then there is the traversing section on the Api
[23:06:56] <gnarf> `api traversing
[23:06:56] <b-ot> gnarf: No matches.
[23:06:59] <gnarf> boo
[23:07:14] <Cork> ?traversing
[23:07:14] <bot-t> Docs: Traversing - http://api.jquery.com/category/Traversing/
[23:07:16] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/
[23:07:17] <abhas> cork: i dont know css whereas the jquery docs talk about selectors a lot of times.. how do i know about them?
[23:07:18] <Cork> :)
[23:07:49] <Cork> abhas: its the exact same selectors you would write in your .css files (with a few extensions)
[23:07:59] <Cork> the extensions is listed in api.jquery.com
[23:08:29] <Cork> and the basic selector concept is documented there too
[23:08:47] <abhas> so should i learn about the selectors from css first?
[23:09:00] <Cork> i would say yes
[23:09:08] <abhas> thanks
[23:09:09] <Cork> if you want to make a webapp you would need them anyway
[23:09:41] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[23:09:57] <gnarf> this might help with learning selectors too abhas
[23:10:05] <Cork> abhas: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Getting_Started/Selectors is quite good too
[23:10:38] <gnarf> pay attention to the ones that have "jQuery Extension" category
[23:10:38] <gnarf> and remember these only work in jQuery, not CSS
[23:10:39] <abhas> gnarf and cork : cool, checking them out..
[23:15:39] <abhas> about $("#myList li:first") - is only "first" and "last" available? for eg "second" doesnt seem to work
[23:15:58] <Cork> ?.eq @ abhas
[23:15:58] <bot-t> abhas, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[23:16:18] <Cork> so $("#myList li").eq(1)
[23:17:00] <tudda|awy> I am having some trouble with unobtrusive validation + dynamic Content.  I've outlined the core of my problem in this pastebin : http://pastebin.com/Fzf4dYiy    I have Firebug and EventBug installed, but I'm just not sure how to diagnose it from here
[23:17:30] <abhas> cork are these first and second in-built?
[23:18:12] <Cork> abhas: :first and :last is css extensions, and they call .first() .last()
[23:18:36] <abhas> ok
[23:18:37] <Cork> so for that kind of selection .eq is normally the better choice
[23:19:13] <FortuneDays> Cork, mind if I shoot you a quick PM?

[23:19:44] <coldhead> ?nopms
[23:19:46] <bot-t> coldhead, Couldn't find "nopms" in jQuery Docs.
[23:19:49] <coldhead> ?nopm

[23:19:50] <skyjumper> he's just Fine-Ass Programming
[23:19:59] <skyjumper> nothing wrong with that
[23:20:07] <Cork> lol
[23:20:12] <ali4ever4> abhas, there is nth-child for jquery http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/ but i guess for performance eq() is better
[23:20:13] <coldhead> there's nothing wrong with anything
[23:20:42] <Cork> ali4ever4: nth-child has better performance, but only in browsers that support it
[23:20:58] <Cork> as it actually happen in the dom native code, and not in js
[23:21:43] <abhas> var $li = $("#myList li:first").appendTo("#myList"); -isnt append supposed to just add the first list element at the last and not remove it from the first
[23:21:50] <ali4ever4> Cork, ah i see so it will be faster on browsers like firefox and chrome and slower on older IEs , that was new to me thanks a lot , thats helpful
[23:22:14] <Cork> ali4ever4: no like it will be faster on browsers that support it, and won't work at all on the other
[23:22:41] <FortuneDays> That answers my question, too
[23:23:02] <ali4ever4> Cork, uh i see now , thanks
[23:23:26] <abhas> so i guess its better to stick with eq() for the starters
[23:23:40] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take 5
[23:24:12] <Cork> abhas: normally yes, but now days the number of browser not supporting nth-child start to thin out greatly
[23:25:04] <Cork> basically i would say all that don't will be dead in ~ a year
[23:25:42] <ali4ever4> Cork, not that soon , my company still use ie 6  -_-
[23:25:52] <Cork> ali4ever4: what os?
[23:26:13] <coldhead> that is the worst thing i have ever heard, ali4ever4
[23:26:18] <Cork> ali4ever4: winxp is dead in < 12 months
[23:26:24] <coldhead> and i heard what justin bieber said about anne frank
[23:26:29] <Cork> and the other os's used ie7
[23:26:33] <Cork> (and up)
[23:26:34] * skyjumper already stopped supporting IE7
[23:26:39] <ali4ever4> Cork, XP for most of the normal staff , hopefully they will upgrade soon
[23:26:47] <skyjumper> hopefully we can be done with IE8 in the next year or two
[23:26:53] <Cork> ali4ever4: they have to winxp is eol in april next year
[23:27:02] <Dragooon> Bomb ie6 users!!!
[23:27:05] <Cork> that's why i said what i did
[23:27:10] <air_> :)
[23:27:22] <air_> I recently got a question if our webapps run on Windows NT 3.51...
[23:27:32] <Cork> when winxp dies so does ie<9
[23:27:34] <Dragooon> Seriously?
[23:27:37] <ali4ever4> coldhead, exactly so when we develop an intranet site we must make it in a way it works simillerly on normal employee's ie6 and CEO's iPad , and it geeks latest firefox and chrome
[23:27:50] <air_> yeah.
[23:27:59] <Dragooon> That's pretty horrifying...
[23:28:02] <Cork> ali4ever4: ouch
[23:28:03] <Dragooon> So...does it?
[23:28:18] <air_> Dragooon: nah, that's not gonna happen.
[23:28:23] <Cork> ali4ever4: been there, done that; its... horrible
[23:28:42] <Dragooon> air_: Damn
[23:28:49] <Cork> ali4ever4: and they demand the newest and snasiest features too?
[23:28:52] <ali4ever4> Cork, :) well looks like company will be foreced to move from XP anyway so thats good
[23:28:56] <coldhead> ah lowest common denominators
[23:29:03] <ali4ever4> Cork, sure :)
[23:29:03] <tudda|awy> I'm utterly confused as to why something is happening. If i Unbind, then bind an event in my document ready.  Then i click a button and it adds html and I call the following lines of code : $("form").removeData("validator");     |         $("form").removeData("unobtrusiveValidation");  |             $.validator.unobtrusive.parse("#form1");  Then i submit. the event that I originally only bind
[23:29:04] <tudda|awy> ONCE, gets called twice. if i click my button a third time and hit save, it gets called 3 times
[23:29:10] <Cork> ali4ever4: ya... been there
[23:29:14] <coldhead> important arithmetic theory, CURSE OF WEB STANDARDS
[23:29:18] <abhas> cork (just reposting) .appendTo("#myList"); -isnt append supposed to just add one list element at some other position and not remove it from the original position
[23:29:23] <air_> Dragooon: even if it did, we'd rather not advertise it. there's not gonna be a better world if people stick to that.
[23:29:32] <Cork> ali4ever4: like 2 days to fix all browsers, and 2 weeks to fix it for ie6 T_T
[23:29:42] <air_> Dragooon: (we're working educational market, so probably some obscure small school who never cared to upgrade)
[23:29:43] * tw2113 dives into myi/myd files
[23:29:49] * Cork shivers from the memory
[23:29:58] <coldhead> way to be, tw2113 <3
[23:30:10] <ali4ever4> Cork, lol yes thats all my daily work fixing things for ie 6 and other browsers T_T
[23:30:35] <tudda|awy> I've also put console.log into my document ready and the unbind/bind is only happening once.
[23:30:42] <tw2113> chances are first i'll try out some diagnostics stuff on the site and see if plugins/theme/whathaveyou are troublesome
[23:30:52] <tw2113> then check what plugins are going, and check support forums
[23:31:05] <utterglee> hey there folks
[23:31:08] <tudda|awy> I can't understand how this event is getting wired up multiple times, and I'm not sure how to get around it
[23:31:17] <utterglee> I'm working with the blueimp jquery file uploader plugin
[23:31:18] <Cork> abhas: a dom element, can only have one parent
[23:31:29] <Cork> abhas: so when you append it to one place it goes away from the other
[23:31:40] <utterglee> it only allows image uploads... can I set it to work with other file types?
[23:31:44] <tw2113> Cork, what if the dom element gets married?
[23:31:53] <Cork> abhas: so use clone
[23:33:25] <Dragooon> air_: ah I see.
[23:33:35] <utterglee> hmm, there is a 'acceptFileTypes' in here: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options
[23:34:14] <air_> Dragooon: it's usually better to tell them "no" than to make it work partly. then we have a chance of them actually noticing they should try to get something more up to date and they may in the end get a better experience.
[23:34:16] <Cork> ?.clone @ abhas
[23:34:16] <bot-t> abhas, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[23:34:19] <coldhead> utterglee: i think by default it allows anything: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/main.js#L41
[23:34:24] <coldhead> that's the code that limits the tpes
[23:34:27] <coldhead> types*
[23:34:29] <coldhead> just don't use that
[23:35:03] <Dragooon> air_: that's true. Lately I've stopped bothering with ie6 and 7, life's been much simpler.
[23:35:05] <utterglee> okay, so that list of gif/jpeg/png doesn't do anything in that regexp?
[23:35:53] <air_> Dragooon: yeah, we avoid supporting those as well.
[23:36:11] <coldhead> i don't know, utterglee, i just glimpsed at the code
[23:36:12] <air_> Dragooon: but the sales people don't take your word for it when they see an opportunity :D
[23:36:13] <Cork> Dragooon: sadly safari and android default webbrowser is setting them self up to be the new ie6
[23:36:19] <coldhead> i've never had to worry about types when i've used that code before
[23:36:24] <coldhead> it Just Worked
[23:36:27] <air_> coldhead: agree.
[23:36:32] <air_> er.
[23:36:34] <air_> Cork: agree.
[23:36:38] <Cork> and not to forgot that ie10 doesn't work aon windows os'es
[23:36:42] <tw2113> teehee, i know coldhead's first name
[23:36:44] <coldhead> i agree with Cork too
[23:36:47] <coldhead> ON ALL MATTERS
[23:36:54] <coldhead> he has my power of attorney
[23:37:01] <Cork> (i really don't understand why they don't support win2008r2)
[23:37:05] <coldhead> and the missing half of my golden amulet
[23:37:26] <utterglee> okay, thanks coldhead, I am using this plugin packaged in a Laravel bundle, maybe the fault lies elsewhere (in that bundle: https://github.com/Pasvaz/laravel-juploader)
[23:37:40] <coldhead> very likely, utterglee
[23:37:45] <Dragooon> Cork: maybe, but they still are pretty decent with updating themselves.
[23:38:57] <ali4ever4> Dragooon, good for you :) i am in the same way many things i started to state that this will not possibly going to work on ie6 users (even if after few weeks of work around it could actually work)
[23:39:23] <tw2113> coldhead...gunther...what time is it there
[23:40:19] <Cork> dragonshed: that is actually the point, they don't
[23:40:24] <Cork> *Dragooon:
[23:40:43] <Cork> Dragooon: the built in browser in android haven't gotten an update for ages
[23:41:27] <Cork> Dragooon: and now days they bundle chrome, so the built in browser (that other apps use) prob won't get any fixes at all
[23:41:33] <coldhead> tw2113: 4:41pm
[23:41:49] <tw2113> probably at the end of the workday then...shit
[23:42:06] <Cork> Dragooon: and iphone don't really get updates for older iphones
[23:42:09] <tw2113> unless you're all weird and work 1pm-9pm
[23:42:16] <coldhead> well this particular workday has a big graduation party at the end of it, so it'll go late
[23:42:32] <ali4ever4> Cork, Dragooon  , well google should kill the built in browser of android and make all people move to chrome that will be for the best for both sides
[23:42:54] <Cork> ali4ever4: third party apps can't use chrome's engine
[23:43:02] <Cork> so that won't work
[23:43:31] <Cork> and one of the reasons it's not updated is the same reason ie6 was around so long
[23:43:45] <Cork> ppl depends on it working in a special way, broken or not
[23:44:16] <ali4ever4> Cork, aouch , didn't notice that ! so thats a big issue then
[23:46:48] <coldhead> what's that thing called in science where other people reproduce your expriments?
[23:47:27] <coldhead> apparently it's called reproducibility
[23:47:28] <coldhead> lame
[23:49:49] <Dragooon> Cork: Ah, I see what you mean. That's a shame, the stock browser is actually faster than chrome ;/
[23:50:40] <tudda|awy> I'm utterly confused as to why something is happening. If i Unbind, then bind an event in my document ready.  Then i click a button and it adds html and I call the following lines of code : $("form").removeData("validator");     |         $("form").removeData("unobtrusiveValidation");  |             $.validator.unobtrusive.parse("#form1");  Then i submit. the event that I originally only bind
[23:50:41] <tudda|awy> ONCE, gets called twice. if i click my button a third time and hit save, it gets called 3 times
[23:52:09] <coldhead> that really sounds like you're bind()ing again inside the click event
[23:52:26] <coldhead> i bet someone could help you fix it if they could see the code
[23:56:09] <coldhead> good morning Kit-10
[23:57:24] <tudda|awy> I've outlined the core of my problem in this pastebin : http://pastebin.com/Fzf4dYiy    I have Firebug and EventBug installed, but I'm just not sure how to diagnose it from here
[23:58:20] <tudda|awy> I have a screen where the user wants to add 10-20-30 entries, and those entries have 4-10 fields each, and there are validators for each.  When i get that many entries, it is just locking up running the jquery validation routines
[23:59:40] <tudda|awy> i am trying to add those entries dynamically using ajax, and then wiring up the validators, and doing client side validation before posting back.
[23:59:52] <didiergm> tudda|awy  which version of jQuery are u using
