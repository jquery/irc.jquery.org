[01:19:43] <JavaLover> so i've finally gotten my project to the stage of optimization
[01:20:02] <JavaLover> now keep in mind this is a mobile app.
[01:20:21] <JavaLover> I think that images are taking a while to render, does anyone have thoughts on how I can improve the speed of image display?
[01:30:31] <William|i7> JavaLover create a low res version and load it first
[01:30:52] <William|i7> then lazy load the larger images
[01:37:01] <JavaLover> umm
[01:37:13] <JavaLover> this isn't really about image size like I agree with that
[01:37:19] <JavaLover> but this is more like I have a google static map
[01:37:36] <JavaLover> and I think it's loading the static map everytime instead of just showing the cached map i'm not sure though
[01:37:57] <JavaLover> and sorry for late response doing a lot of tests William|i7
[01:41:43] <pickandmix> hey guys, does anyone know how I can use jquery to change an img src in python flask?
[02:37:53] <hellyeah> is there a difference or in performance or in something else between using "delegate"     $body.on('click','#new', createANewDatepickerSection); or using event like $body.on('click',function(){ somefunction() });
[02:45:32] <JavaLover> to anyone in here who heard me ask questions about google static maps. I did a bunch of cleanup & removed console.log() stuff and now it's really fast. So it was never a google static map problem was a javascript loading issue :D
[02:45:35] <JavaLover> but thx for help :D
[03:08:10] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[03:10:47] <hellyeah> using map with appended element or using eac which one gives me better result?
[04:40:45] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[04:45:47] <lohfu> hi. i cannot understand where the `toggle` method in my JS comes from. in the jquery source it looks like this: https://ptpb.pw/MzNt/js#L-30, but when i call `console.log($.fn.toggle)` i get https://ptpb.pw/KbT5/js
[04:46:12] <lohfu> both the source and my local jquery is 1.11.3
[04:46:22] <lohfu> hellyeah: what do you mean by result? speed?
[04:47:00] <hellyeah> i dont remember did i say that?
[04:47:27] <lohfu> yes: " using map with appended element or using eac which one gives me better result?"
[04:47:35] <hellyeah> ah
[04:48:01] <hellyeah> one of the guy say using each cause redrawing everytime
[04:48:05] <hellyeah> this is my code http://dpaste.com/143QVQ6
[04:48:07] <lohfu> hellyeah: map is meant to transform the jQuery object, while each is meant for iterating over each element.
[04:49:13] <hellyeah> lohfu:  i understood the difference now
[04:49:18] <lohfu> map constructs and returns a jquery object. since you aren't saving the returned result, you might as well just use each.
[04:49:26] <hellyeah> so map transform the jquery object
[04:49:34] <hellyeah> and it doesnt do that everytime
[04:49:43] <hellyeah> cuz it is in dom anymore
[04:49:46] <hellyeah> am i correct?
[04:49:50] <lohfu> hellyeah: yeah, just like the Array.prototype.map does.
[04:50:14] <hellyeah> saving returned result how can i do that?
[04:51:01] <lohfu> just by saving it to a variable.
[04:51:02] <hellyeah> this is my code line 47-line 108 http://jsfiddle.net/eefvjubt/27/
[04:51:12] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:51:24] <lohfu> ie. `var newObject = jQuery.map()`
[04:51:25] <hellyeah> assign to a variable and return that variable you mean?
[04:52:18] <hellyeah> smt like that http://dpaste.com/01Q4P7V
[04:53:00] <hellyeah> i will come back
[04:53:08] <hellyeah> pls help me about that thanks
[04:58:11] <lohfu> nevermind, i got it. line 7604 in the source (1.11.2).
[04:59:02] <Tennis> what do i want to use to iterate through an array with jquery?
[04:59:12] <Tennis> .each() applied to an array it didnt like that
[05:19:11] <Amnesia> question, I need to get the all the td values of a tbody
[05:19:14] <Amnesia> $("td", tbody) only gives me td itself, instead of the value
[05:19:40] <Amnesia> I want to fetch all values of the first td entry of every row
[06:07:36] <Cork> Amnesia: tbody.find('td:first-child').map(function() { return $(this).text() });
[06:07:49] <Cork> ah, sorry
[06:07:52] <Cork> Amnesia: tbody.find('td:first-child').map(function() { return $(this).text() }).get();
[06:10:33] <GrundeLL> Hello, im trying to figure out how to make a helper for handlebars where i change the value between years and months, though after a lot of trial and error i've decided to ask here how to go about it, http://jsfiddle.net/a9wjbsch/239/ the fiddle shows what i want to to do (maturityClean)
[06:15:08] <Amnesia> C0tyvm
[06:40:50] <lohfu> Tennis: use jQuery.each() instead of .each()
[06:41:03] <Tennis> ahh cheers
[06:41:10] <Tennis> i ended up using raw JS
[06:41:12] <Tennis> but thanks
[06:47:05] <hellyeah> hey again
[06:50:46] <aftab> Hello, I want to put some details for some players in an array in jquery, I have tried this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/15320300/   but it says "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'player_id' of undefined"
[06:50:59] <aftab> please let me know how do I create a multidimentional array in this ?
[06:51:23] <aftab> or is there other way to use this information please ?
[06:51:45] <hellyeah> lohfu:  does it seem correct line 47-60 http://jsfiddle.net/eefvjubt/28/
[07:00:09] <lohfu> hellyeah: mapObj will be an array (jQuery.map returns an array). and since you never reuse the mapObj variable, you might as well just use jQuery.each.
[07:07:27] <hellyeah> lohfu:  sometimes ago you said map transform into jquery object
[07:08:16] <hellyeah> lohfu:  do i need to create mapObj in the line of Jquery.map
[07:08:18] <hellyeah> ?
[07:47:48] <lohfu> hellyeah: no, i said it transforms the jquery object, not transforms INTO. and i then i thought you were referring to .map(), not jQuery.map().
[07:48:36] <lohfu> hellyeah: jQuery.map: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.map/ .map: http://api.jquery.com/map/
[07:51:05] <GrundeLL> Hello im trying to do a case rewrite for handlebars, but cant seam to understand how to do it, i hope someone here is able to help me with this, i have removed the Handlebars.helper and quoted out the function that with the result i want to achive in order for you to see the results,  http://jsfiddle.net/a9wjbsch/239/
[07:52:03] <GrundeLL> Would be lovely if someone could look at it and take the time to explain how i should go about this.
[07:52:18] <GrundeLL> http://jsfiddle.net/a9wjbsch/241/
[08:19:46] <hellyeah> lohfu:  ic
[08:25:35] <hellyeah> lohfu:  do you know about datepickers? do you know about datepickers?
[08:28:59] <lohfu> hellyeah: nope.
[08:29:15] <hellyeah> okey thanks
[08:50:17] <joy4u> if there are list of items in a table and want to update the data-id serially how to do that?
[08:51:29] <hellyeah> joy4u:  you can give id to each of them
[08:52:19] <taplar> how go the script modifications hellyeah?
[08:52:38] <hellyeah> let me show you
[08:54:03] <joy4u> hellyeah: please show me the code it will help me
[08:54:05] <hellyeah> i try to understand this map issue but probably i need to use .map instead of jquery.map http://jsfiddle.net/eefvjubt/30/ i try to fix the thing you wrote as command.
[08:54:20] <hellyeah> joy4u:  you should fiddle it by yourself
[08:54:25] <hellyeah> i am not really expert
[08:54:37] <hellyeah> i suggest you to start with table first
[08:54:42] <hellyeah> btw
[08:54:54] <hellyeah> do you want to give data-smt to td or tr?
[08:55:17] <taplar> hellyeah: so your storing the result of map() but your still appending inside
[08:56:05] <decx> gonna use this higher order function and then leak state
[08:56:17] <hellyeah> yeah i am storing the map to mapObj
[08:56:28] <taplar> re-read #b up top
[08:57:01] <taplar> it says why it could be better, and how
[08:57:43] <hellyeah> i understand
[08:58:00] <hellyeah> but i need to append something to seconddropdown right
[08:58:08] <taplar> yep
[08:58:21] <taplar> the resulting array, like it says in b)
[08:59:18] <hellyeah> i guess you are talking about adding mapObj to seconddropdown right
[08:59:19] <hellyeah> ?
[08:59:34] <taplar> what does map() return?
[09:00:15] <hellyeah> JQuery.map return array .map return jquery object
[09:00:25] <hellyeah> but i am using jquery.map is that false?
[09:00:25] <taplar> which can be appended to an element
[09:00:30] <taplar> doesn't matter
[09:00:39] <hellyeah> sec
[09:01:07] <taplar> jquery object is an array like construct, both it and arrays can be appended to the dom
[09:01:49] <hellyeah> i guess you didnt mean that http://jsfiddle.net/eefvjubt/31/
[09:02:12] <taplar> not sure what you changed
[09:02:29] <hellyeah> sorry
[09:02:33] <hellyeah> line 115
[09:02:48] <decx> dont you get like mildew looking at this datepickers stuff for 3 months
[09:03:09] <taplar> multiple eachs, i was looking at a previous one
[09:03:20] <taplar> hellyeah: yes, that's what you want
[09:03:39] <hellyeah> decx:  this is not about datepickers right now
[09:03:48] <taplar> however you should probably do the append inside the conditional where it's being created
[09:03:48] <hellyeah> decx:  it is another issue
[09:04:05] <taplar> hellyeah: and you don't really need the extra variable
[09:04:07] <hellyeah> taplar:  but when you select firstdropdown i didnt get any result in second dropdown
[09:04:21] <hellyeah> extra variable?
[09:04:29] <taplar> $secondDropdown.append($.map(......
[09:05:28] <taplar> eh, the way you got it is fine, since your reusing the variable
[09:05:38] <taplar> however, the mapObj is scoped too high
[09:06:01] <hellyeah> i learntü
[09:06:14] <hellyeah> variable decleration is hoisted on top
[09:06:22] <hellyeah> thats why i define on the top
[09:06:28] <hellyeah> var doesnt have block level scope
[09:06:29] <taplar> it'd be more accurate to scope it to the change function
[09:06:41] <hellyeah> ah
[09:06:48] <hellyeah> yes
[09:06:55] <hellyeah> for initializing again everytime right
[09:07:26] <taplar> otherwise there is a change of hitting your bottom else conditional that doesn't create any new map data and it could reuse previously created map data
[09:07:31] <taplar> change=chance
[09:09:41] <hellyeah> understood
[09:11:41] <hellyeah> ,i did stupid paranthesis error i couldnt find dang
[09:13:13] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i ask what did i do wrong here i really couldnt find   line 85-117 http://jsfiddle.net/eefvjubt/32/
[09:14:39] <hellyeah> no paranthesis error here
[09:16:37] <taplar> you have three errors
[09:18:13] <hellyeah> three errors
[09:18:15] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:18:23] <hellyeah> why js didnt report exact error
[09:18:26] <hellyeah> yeah
[09:18:33] <hellyeah> i mean i have three paranthesis error
[09:18:38] <hellyeah> same error in every blockj
[09:18:47] <hellyeah> couldnt find what it is :/
[09:18:55] <DraeliYA> hi
[09:19:33] <hellyeah> DraeliYA:  hey
[09:19:51] <hellyeah> taplar:  any tips?_
[09:20:03] <taplar> tidy your code and look again
[09:22:40] <DraeliYA> I have a question about Deferred. I run with resolve my Defer but there is a way to change resolve value for function witch will call behind this function ? Because I saw with $.when().then(), if you give return, you change arguments for next function but I don't find a way with Defer
[09:23:44] <joy4u> is there any jquery plugin that will drag and drop and and update the data attribute according to order
[09:24:11] <hellyeah> i am sure there is no paranthesis error
[09:24:20] <taplar> joy4u: there is the jquery ui drag and drop, but i'm not sure if it does the data thing
[09:24:30] <hellyeah> you can check jquery ui for drag and drop
[09:24:31] <taplar> joy4u: but you could probably implement that with their callbacks
[09:24:44] <taplar> hellyeah: there is, the parser is telling you there is
[09:24:51] <taplar> you can disbelieve it all you want, :)
[09:25:19] <hellyeah> why parse didnt tell me exact line :/
[09:25:40] <taplar> *shrug*
[09:25:55] <taplar> at some point you have to be able to debug these things yourself man
[09:26:20] <hellyeah> i am trying
[09:26:21] <joy4u> taplar: i don't have very good knowledge in jquery so can anyone please help
[09:26:28] <hellyeah> all paranthesis matched :X
[09:26:46] <taplar> hellyeah: they do not.  i already told you there are three errors.
[09:26:53] <taplar> the parser is telling you too
[09:26:57] <taplar> your just not seeing it
[09:27:03] <hellyeah> joy4u:  http://try.jquery.com/
[09:27:20] <hellyeah> taplar:  yes it is the case :p
[09:27:27] <taplar> so keep looking
[09:27:51] <taplar> think about what you changed
[09:27:54] <taplar> you didn't have that error
[09:28:00] <taplar> you made a change.  now you have that error
[09:31:08] <hellyeah> error is in append
[09:31:12] <hellyeah> i am sure
[09:31:19] <taplar> so fix it
[09:31:53] <hellyeah> sec
[09:35:31] <awkwardCough> joy4u: https://jqueryui.com/sortable/ similar to what you described
[09:35:51] <hellyeah> i really couldnt find what i did miss
[09:36:05] <taplar> that sux
[09:36:16] <hellyeah> i know
[09:36:19] <hellyeah> i am blind
[09:36:40] <awkwardCough> hellyeah: try taking out what you changed and then debuging what you added
[09:37:40] <hellyeah> i did that
[09:37:57] <hellyeah> it is because of "append"
[09:39:02] <taplar> semi-colons go at the end of statements
[09:39:08] <taplar> yes?
[09:39:25] <hellyeah> yes
[09:39:28] <hellyeah> for "map"
[09:39:32] <taplar> no
[09:39:35] <taplar> statements
[09:40:19] <awkwardCough> click the tidy buttonto see if you have any misplaced semicolons
[09:40:30] <hellyeah> damn it
[09:40:35] <hellyeah> damn
[09:40:43] <hellyeah> that really sucks man
[09:41:03] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am sorry
[09:41:10] <taplar> so why couldn't you find that?
[09:41:10] <hellyeah> i will be more intelligent next time
[09:41:12] <hellyeah> i promise
[09:41:55] <hellyeah> i dont know how i couldnt see obvious
[09:41:58] <hellyeah> sh*t
[09:42:35] <taplar> don't be frustrated.  just figure out what your mental block was, and work on removing it
[09:42:56] <hellyeah> yes
[09:43:45] <hellyeah> i will do that
[09:43:54] <hellyeah> so what i understand is
[09:44:10] <hellyeah> wwhen i select element from first drop down there will be jquery element for it
[09:44:42] <hellyeah> so jquery dont need to construct jquery element everytime when i select something from first dropdown is that correct?
[09:45:36] <taplar> i have no idea what part your talking about
[09:45:41] <taplar> it's a large fiddle dude
[09:46:18] <hellyeah> no no
[09:46:26] <hellyeah> i mean i changed each to map right
[09:46:41] <hellyeah> and i remembered with each everytime you redraw dropdown
[09:46:49] <hellyeah> thats heavy procedure for browser
[09:46:53] <taplar> 58-61 is still broken
[09:46:55] <hellyeah> you typed that right
[09:47:23] <hellyeah> taplar:  i fixed that also http://jsfiddle.net/eefvjubt/33/
[09:47:34] <hellyeah> and map will avoid this redawing thing
[09:47:40] <hellyeah> because object is there
[09:47:51] <hellyeah> when you select smt from firstdropdown
[09:47:52] <taplar> no, map doesn't do that
[09:47:58] <taplar> jquery does it
[09:48:03] <hellyeah> ah
[09:48:05] <hellyeah> okey
[09:48:08] <hellyeah> understood
[09:48:24] <taplar> when you give an array to append() it creates a document fragment behind the scenes and puts the elements in it
[09:48:33] <taplar> when that is appended to the dom, it's a single redraw
[09:48:51] <taplar> map() is not doing any of that.  it's only being used to create the array
[09:49:25] <hellyeah> i understand
[09:49:30] <hellyeah> map is creating array
[09:49:36] <hellyeah> and append add it to the dom
[09:50:39] <taplar> alright, so it looks like you understand b) now, and it looked like you improved on a)
[09:50:43] <taplar> time for c)
[09:51:52] <hellyeah> ah okey
[09:51:58] <hellyeah> actually i did some changes on c
[09:52:07] <hellyeah> let me do it again sec
[09:52:47] <hellyeah> i need to smoke
[09:52:50] <hellyeah> brb
[10:12:55] <hellyeah> hey again
[10:19:53] <pluszak> Hello everyone. I'm trying to fire an event when an input is changed by a 3rd party script. .change() doesn't seem to register it. Am I correct it only works when something is changed by a user or have I done something wrong?
[10:21:29] <taplar_brb> change() fires when the element is changed by the user or fired manually
[10:21:56] <pluszak> :(
[10:22:01] <taplar> it will not process if a previous handler terminated the event
[10:22:17] <pluszak> And I guess there is no automatic way to watch that?
[10:23:09] <taplar> not that i'm aware of
[10:26:27] <pluszak> mutationobserver?
[10:27:19] <taplar> iirc that would let you know when it changed, not what handlers are processing
[10:27:32] <taplar> and they are not widely implemented in browsers yet, iirc
[10:27:47] <pluszak> I don't care what changed it, I just want to know it changed
[10:28:52] <pluszak> hmm...Either IE11 or higher...
[10:39:40] <hellyeah> taplar:
[10:39:47] <hellyeah> hmm you back good
[10:40:00] <taplar> yup
[10:40:09] <hellyeah> this is the change i did http://jsfiddle.net/eefvjubt/35/
[10:40:29] <hellyeah> line 144
[10:40:52] <taplar> cool
[10:41:11] <hellyeah> is that correct hmm
[10:41:18] <taplar> wait
[10:41:19] <hellyeah> but this avoids one thing tho
[10:41:23] <taplar> your doing pairs, right?
[10:41:24] <hellyeah> i am waiting
[10:41:31] <hellyeah> pairs?
[10:41:36] <hellyeah> from and to yes
[10:41:43] <taplar> so last would only get one of them
[10:41:53] <hellyeah> ah
[10:41:55] <hellyeah> ye
[10:42:01] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:42:08] <hellyeah> sec
[10:42:15] <taplar> you want the last .datePicker
[10:42:17] <hellyeah> i guess
[10:42:25] <hellyeah> find method can take two selector
[10:42:27] <taplar> and from that find the .input
[10:43:15] <taplar> last() gets the last element in the result set, regardless of the number of selectors
[10:43:45] <hellyeah> line 144 http://jsfiddle.net/eefvjubt/36/
[10:44:09] <hellyeah> am i close?
[10:44:15] <taplar> yep
[10:44:33] <hellyeah> not done yet i guess
[10:44:38] <taplar> no, that's fine
[10:44:47] <hellyeah> i think it is correct
[10:44:48] <hellyeah> heheh
[10:45:53] <hellyeah> btw
[10:46:01] <hellyeah> this onClose thing didnt work correctly
[10:46:09] <hellyeah> i just want to do we are in march
[10:46:20] <hellyeah> and if i select date from april in "from"
[10:46:26] <hellyeah> i want to see april in "to"
[10:46:34] <hellyeah> but that doesnt work quiet
[10:47:11] <hellyeah> 291-293 332-334
[10:48:00] <taplar> same problem as c)
[10:48:11] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:48:17] <taplar> your doing global lookups
[10:48:21] <hellyeah> lemme take a look real quick
[10:48:27] <hellyeah> also there is a bug

[10:51:06] <hellyeah> is there an error about datepickers?
[10:51:14] <taplar> your doing global lookups
[10:51:39] <hellyeah> so i should us same thing i guess
[10:51:44] <taplar> your most likely multiple binding or setting more fields than your meaning to
[10:51:57] <hellyeah> okey i got this
[10:52:04] <hellyeah> i need to use same thing
[10:52:27] <hellyeah> but taplar  at the same time this gave me flexibility
[10:52:39] <hellyeah> i mean if user createn ten datepickers at one time
[10:52:52] <hellyeah> he/she can select dates from any of them
[10:53:03] <taplar> you don't want to bind multiple times the same logic
[10:53:12] <taplar> and you only want to change the elements you want to change
[10:53:14] <hellyeah> understood
[10:53:26] <hellyeah> in that case, it must be last one
[10:53:32] <hellyeah> correct?
[10:53:34] <taplar> your changing all '.to' calenders when the from changes
[10:53:38] <taplar> idk
[10:53:42] <taplar> maybe they're not changing the last one
[10:53:53] <taplar> you gotta start thinking in context
[10:54:16] <hellyeah> at least
[10:54:23] <hellyeah> i am really better then the past
[10:54:28] <hellyeah> i will get over it i am sure
[10:54:56] <hellyeah> taplar:  you are really mature and nice person
[10:55:01] <hellyeah> i am gonna say this
[10:55:25] <hellyeah> it is kind of sincere thing i know chat is not the place for that kinda thing
[10:55:38] <taplar> eh, i'm just a dude in a chatroom, :)
[10:55:41] <hellyeah> but felt better to say this :) forgive me if i am rude
[10:55:49] <taplar> it's cool
[10:55:54] <hellyeah> i saw lot of jerks
[10:56:17] <hellyeah> some of them humiliat people because people dont know what the know
[10:56:23] <hellyeah> you are not like that
[10:56:30] <taplar> hope not atleast
[10:56:43] <hellyeah> what i see is this
[10:56:49] <hellyeah> so keep calm and carry on dude
[10:57:36] <hellyeah> good evening
[10:57:49] <taplar> take care
[11:17:57] <Cyclohexane> why might $.ajaxPrefilter not be running for some requests? is it depending on the order it's loaded?
[11:18:21] <Cyclohexane> i have a break point inside the filter and it never gets hit for some ajax requests
[11:20:31] <taplar> are you giving ajaxPrefilter data types?
[11:22:20] <taplar> only thing i'm seeing in the docs is if you give it data types and the ajax is not using those it will not execute the prefilter
[11:23:55] <Cyclohexane> taplar: the library that is making the request is actually using "new XMLHttpRequest" does that make a difference?
[11:24:06] <taplar> oh yeah
[11:24:11] <Cyclohexane> i could of sworn this was working a month ago lol
[11:24:12] <taplar> that's not a jquery ajax request
[11:24:53] <taplar> $.ajax, $.get, $.post, etc are jQuery ajax requests
[11:25:22] <taplar> it doesn't know anything about logic that uses the vanilla ajax request structures
[11:27:26] <Cyclohexane> taplar: alright thanks
[11:34:10] <Saul775> Just a quick question.  I'm using $.ajax(...), and I'm calling a GET method.  I want to serialize my 'data' section in the BODY of the request, but when I look at the call in Fiddler, it's serializing it in the query string.  How can I make it serialize to the body?
[11:34:48] <taplar> get's don't have a body...
[11:34:57] <taplar> post's do
[11:42:33] <hxm> is it possible to store html data in data-toggle- attribute?
[11:43:10] <taplar> you can put any data in data-* elements.
[11:45:34] <altab> hello, I'm using Jvectormap http://jvectormap.com/ (with the france regions map) and I want to "smooth" borders/strokes (ex: http://www.bootply.com/gGsp1ga9v4#), can you help me please?
[11:46:44] <Saul775> Thank you, taper.
[11:46:57] <hxm> aah true, i was using .html() instead .text()
[11:47:01] <Saul775> Silly, autocorrect.  Thank you, taplar.
[11:47:08] <taplar> close enough
[11:47:40] <taplar> hxm: hmm?
[11:51:39] <xinming> Just curious, How do I do $('50').insertBefore('...')   correctly?
[11:52:10] <xinming> I mean, How do I mean is, Insert a text fragment before an element.
[11:52:24] <xinming> for now, $('<div>..</div>').insertBefore('...')  worked fine.
[11:52:38] <taplar> that'd be how you do it
[11:52:52] <xinming> But I jsut want to insert a text node.
[11:52:57] <xinming> Not a tree node. :-(
[11:53:56] <taplar> $(targetSelector).before('50');
[11:55:45] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/mj0c46q7/
[11:56:12] <xinming> Oh, Thanks
[11:58:43] <xinming> That worked, thanks.
[11:58:46] <xinming> may I know why?
[11:59:02] <taplar> just how the method works.
[11:59:09] <taplar> what's confusing you?
[12:07:08] <xinming> taplar_lunch: The confusing thing is, $('blabla').insertBefore($target)  doesn't work.
[12:07:33] <xinming> I just realized that $('blabla')  maybe interpreted into something like  $('selector');
[12:14:31] <taplar_lunch> ;)
[12:15:21] <taplar_lunch> even if it didn't, '50' isn't a dom element which are mainly what are intended to be in jquery result sets
[12:27:46] <decx> before and after are just wrappers for insertBefore
[12:35:54] <sigdk> Hello, I have a form that submits some data to the backend and returns to the website. Now I want to modify current implementation and let the backend respond with a json object. I've added a submit(end) handler on my form. How do I grab the returning object in there ?
[12:36:57] <NoiseEee> do you mean you are now sending by XHR vs traditional form posting/
[12:39:25] <altab> hello, I'm using Jvectormap http://jvectormap.com/ (with the france regions map) and I want to "smooth" borders/strokes (ex: http://www.bootply.com/gGsp1ga9v4#), can you help me please?
[12:40:12] <sigdk> NoiseEee, XHR ? I do a POST request when submitting (I guess thats what you mean "traditional")
[12:40:26] <robertmaxrees> altab not sure what you mean - could you clarify?
[12:40:44] <NoiseEee> sigdk: meaning you are doing ajax, or just submitting a traditional form/ie:  submit goes to the <form>s target?
[12:41:07] <NoiseEee> sigdk: er, action
[12:41:26] <sigdk> NoiseEee, no, I don't do ajax request. I submit a traditional form
[12:41:35] <altab> ok I'll take examples robertmaxrees : here are default borders/stroke http://jvectormap.com/maps/countries/france-regions-2016/ (white strokes between regions) and I want to smooth it to obtain a result like this http://www.bootply.com/gGsp1ga9v4
[12:41:53] <robertmaxrees> altab so you have an example showing you how to get what you want... what's the question?
[12:42:28] <NoiseEee> sigdk: well then you're going to get a full page reload after the form is submitted, there is no returning 'object', its wherever your backend sends you
[12:42:29] <sigdk> actually, I know how to do it with ajax... but not in the way it is currenly implemented (form submit)
[12:42:56] <NoiseEee> sigdk: so your question is 'how can i do an ajax post instead and get an object as a response to the form submission' ?
[12:43:36] <altab> robertmaxrees, > how to smooth borders? | I'm searching in the example but I don't find it
[12:43:42] <sigdk> NoiseEee, so... I can't return an object ?
[12:44:01] <decx> altab: why use a jquery plugin to display an svg
[12:44:05] <altab> robertmaxrees, he uses original svg and I tried almost every parameters
[12:44:07] <NoiseEee> sigdk: you could if you were doing an ajax post, otherwise a form actually goes to a new page, right?  whatever the "action' attribute is
[12:44:08] <sigdk> NoiseEee, no, I know how to do it with ajax
[12:44:17] <altab> decx, why not, it's easy and fast to use
[12:44:22] <robertmaxrees> altab you can try commenting out lines until the feature goes away >.>
[12:44:29] <decx> it's ridiculous
[12:44:45] <altab> then tell me why this plugin has thousands users
[12:44:50] <decx> people are stupid
[12:44:52] <altab> robertmaxrees, thanks for helping, appreciated
[12:44:55] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, unless you're trying to get some special functionality, you don't need a plugin for SVG.
[12:45:05] <sigdk> NoiseEee, can't I set the return page AND return an object ?
[12:45:43] <NoiseEee> sigdk: i guess you could have your backend write an object to part of that new page, but... why/what are you really trying to do?
[12:46:16] <NoiseEee> sigdk: an http request/page load gives you one thing, right.
[12:46:29] <sigdk> NoiseEee, yes
[12:47:05] <NoiseEee> sigdk: so you can't ask for a web page and something else at the same time
[12:47:10] <NoiseEee> sigdk: again, what are you really trying to do?
[12:48:34] <sigdk> NoiseEee, I have form that I register a user. On submit, the form posts data to the backend in the traditional way. Now I want to add a "feature" and whenever I register a user, have an alert window letting me know under what identifier the user was registered (this is set by the backend)
[12:50:30] <taplar_lunch> mmm, alert windows
[12:54:02] <taplar> dang, room died
[12:54:24] <NoiseEee> sigdk: so send that back with the backend...  have some JS on the returning page that looks to see if someVar is defined (like a message) and then present it if it is
[12:55:45] <sigdk> NoiseEee, when do I set the someVar ?
[12:56:37] <NoiseEee> sigdk: your back-end is going to have to send it, or return it in a URL param....  memberAdd.php?previousAdd=Member+124+was+added
[12:57:23] <sigdk> NoiseEee, I see... not that clean indeed
[12:57:30] <taplar> just stick it in a hidden field
[12:57:38] <NoiseEee> or that
[12:58:11] <sigdk> taplar, explain more please :)
[12:58:33] <taplar> in the case that they register a user, and the id or whatever is created, put that in a hidden field on the response
[12:58:47] <taplar> <input type="hidden" name="generatedId" value="whatever">
[12:58:56] <taplar> then just check for the existance of that element
[13:01:30] <gambl0re> http://jsbin.com/huzobozesi/edit?html,js,console
[13:01:38] <gambl0re> why isnt my click event executing?
[13:01:55] <sigdk> taplar, so, whenever I reload the page. I check the document.getElementById("myhiddenelement").val. If it set, the I throw a popup. Right ?
[13:02:14] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re look at the warning.
[13:02:32] <taplar> var field = $('#idofField'); if (field.length) alert(field.val());
[13:02:34] <taplar> or whatever
[13:03:11] <decx> you cant attach events to document gambl0re
[13:03:18] <taplar> personally i'd probably just stick that info in a green alert box at the top of the page
[13:03:23] <decx> either document.body, window or whatever element
[13:03:35] <taplar> "User 'newguy' registered with id 'hisid'"
[13:03:40] <gambl0re> http://jsbin.com/huzobozesi/edit?html,js,console
[13:03:44] <robertmaxrees> and what are you trying to do with while(new Date() < ms){} ?
[13:03:53] <robertmaxrees> because the handler DOES work otherwise.
[13:03:53] <gambl0re> still not working
[13:03:59] <decx> it does?
[13:04:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/3Lkeau9o/
[13:04:16] <robertmaxrees> the event bubbles to the document.
[13:04:22] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that weird waitThreeSeconds function
[13:04:28] <decx> oh welll
[13:04:49] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re and this is working inside that bin for me.
[13:04:59] <robertmaxrees> open the output and try clicking.
[13:05:00] <decx> i guess it would come through there on its way bubbling up to window huh
[13:05:18] <gambl0re> https://jsfiddle.net/3Lkeau9o/
[13:05:26] <gambl0re> you're code is different
[13:05:36] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re your last bin also functions.
[13:05:45] <sigdk> taplar, one last (I hope) question... how does the backend set the hidden field nicely ? Currently I 'm afraid I've mixed jsp code with javascript too bad
[13:06:00] <taplar> your jsp would set it
[13:06:45] <taplar> you'd have to put the id on one of the model elements the jsp has access to while it is building
[13:07:50] <gambl0re> ok it seems to work in jsfiddle but not in my local files
[13:08:04] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re any errors or anything locally?
[13:08:28] <gambl0re> no, its the exact same code i used in the jsfiddle
[13:08:42] <robertmaxrees> try killing that function and the place you call it - same thing?
[13:09:03] <gambl0re> anyways, why does the click event console.log happen after the two other console logs
[13:09:17] <gambl0re> shouldnt the click event occur immediately?
[13:09:38] <gambl0re> immediately once i click the document
[13:09:59] <robertmaxrees> you have some strange code doing some strange things in there.
[13:10:18] <gambl0re> its an example code from a course im learning
[13:10:57] <Duder9999> hello all. Anyone here familiar with DataTables. I am using a table that has only 40 records, and takes almost 20 seconds to load from database. Paging is on. And also some tabs have only 2 records that will appears but it waits to load ALL the records before displaying. It says there are ways to speed up Datatables but it seems to apply to records over 5000.  Any tips or links?
[13:10:59] <gambl0re> do you know why the click event doesnt console log immediately after i click? it only shows up after the two other console.logs are finsihed
[13:11:24] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re because that while loop locks the browser as far as i can tell.
[13:11:46] <gambl0re> locks the browser?
[13:12:07] <robertmaxrees> yes.  when i load your jsbin, my browser becomes unresponsive until those functions finish
[13:12:37] <gambl0re> can you explain to me what that function is doing?
[13:12:47] <taplar> loop probably doesn't allow the process to defer
[13:13:09] <robertmaxrees> the while loop spins up a new date and checks if it's less than the value of ms.
[13:13:16] <robertmaxrees> that's a pretty slow process.
[13:13:44] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?  create a delay before something happens?
[13:13:58] <gambl0re> what is this line doing? 	var ms = 3000 + new Date().getTime();
[13:14:06] <robertmaxrees> what do you think it's doing?
[13:14:10] <gambl0re> what should be the value of ms
[13:14:32] <gambl0re> add 3000ms (3 sec) to the current time?
[13:14:39] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTime
[13:14:57] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's adding 3000 to whatever getTime() returns
[13:15:09] <robertmaxrees> is this trying to create a timer or something?
[13:15:35] <gambl0re> that code is supposed to explain how asynchronous callbacks work in javascript
[13:16:23] <gambl0re> anyways...
[13:16:44] <robertmaxrees> weird.  should just use timeouts for that, but ok.
[13:28:05] <JILL_> quick question
[13:28:19] <robertmaxrees> quick response
[13:28:20] <JILL_> how do i combine these 2 lines into one?
[13:28:23] <JILL_>                 $('.btn-text').addClass('loading btn-disabled');                 $('.btn-text').text('Reserving your seat').addClass('loading');
[13:28:39] <JILL_> more specifically the add class
[13:28:55] <taplar> looks like your doing the same thing, the first having an extra class
[13:28:58] <robertmaxrees>  $('.btn-text').addClass('loading btn-disabled loading').text('Reserving your seat');
[13:29:27] <JILL_> Thanks @robert
[13:29:29] <robertmaxrees> JILL_ http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[13:29:42] <robertmaxrees> see where it says "Returns: jQuery" to the right?
[13:30:06] <JILL_> yes
[13:30:21] <robertmaxrees> that means you get back a jquery object - usually it's the element that you're working against.
[13:30:27] <robertmaxrees> so you can chain methods that way.
[13:31:05] <JILL_> cool never noticed it before, thanks!
[14:08:26] <Duder9999> Anyone here famiiar with datatables?
[14:13:57] <taplar> what's your question?  if anyone can help they'll pipe in
[14:25:30] <Duder9999> hi taplar.
[14:26:06] <Duder9999> I am using a table that has only 40 records, and takes almost 20 seconds to load from database. Paging is on. And also some tabs have only 2 records that will appears but it waits to load ALL the records before displaying. It says there are ways to speed up Datatables but it seems to apply to records over 5000.  I am drawing data from a mysql database.
[14:26:47] <Duder9999> using $result = mysqli_query($con,"SELECT * FROM products where status IN 'in_stock'; to grab the data from the database
[14:27:49] <robertmaxrees> is your question about sql, php, or datatables?
[14:28:41] <robertmaxrees> because it sounds like your issue is that your query is WAY slow.
[14:28:43] <Duder9999> Well, I am not sure I setup datatables correctly. The support documentation mainly shows pulling data from a static set
[14:28:54] <robertmaxrees> right, but your backend is taking 20 seconds to load.
[14:28:56] <Duder9999> or it is somehow pulled into ajax without an explanation how
[14:28:59] <robertmaxrees> that's where you want to optimize.
[14:30:49] <Duder9999> yes
[14:31:10] <Duder9999> Am I supposed to use ajax to pull the data out of the database?
[14:31:17] <robertmaxrees> you can, sure.
[14:31:23] <Duder9999> is that faster?
[14:31:30] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:31:39] <robertmaxrees> your problem has nothing to do with ajax vs. non-ajax.
[14:31:46] <robertmaxrees> and everything to do with your DB being way slow.
[14:32:39] <Duder9999> hmm. how do you speed up a DB?
[14:33:11] <robertmaxrees> that's a great question for a channel about DBs :)
[14:33:21] <Duder9999> true
[14:33:25] <netcrime> I wan't to make filter by region/city on my website. Each time box checked for city I want to send request with ajax to server and receive ads for that city and then show those ads on page. Can anyone show me example of something similar done or maybe point to good tutorial ?
[14:34:26] <robertmaxrees> netcrime you just need to learn about callbacks at that point :)
[14:34:48] <Duder9999> robertmaxrees would pulling the data into ajax and hten have ajax spit out the data to datatables increase the speed?
[14:35:07] <robertmaxrees> Duder9999 you're rephrasing your earlier question.
[14:35:09] <netcrime> callback can be function that manipulate received data?
[14:35:24] <robertmaxrees> Duder9999 ajax has NOTHING to do with your current performance issues
[14:35:32] <robertmaxrees> netcrime callbacks are functions that handle the returns data, yes.
[14:35:39] <Duder9999> ah gotcha
[14:37:11] <netcrime> robertmaxrees thanks ill check that :)
[14:47:08] <Ackis> can someone explain this line of code to me: var keepParams = configArguments && Object.prototype.toString.call(configArguments.keepParams) === '[object Array]' ? configArguments.keepParams : []; - is it basically just checking to see if we have configArguements, and it's an array use it, if it's not, use an empty array?
[14:47:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[14:47:34] <robertmaxrees> it's a convoluted way to do that, but yeah.
[14:48:03] <robertmaxrees> and it's checking if configArguments exists and, if so, is its keepParams property is an array,
[14:52:39] <Ackis> thanks
[17:56:22] <cwek> How can I get mouse position of rotated element?
[17:56:43] <cwek> mouse position inside of element..
[17:57:02] <duch_kazatel> you want the position of the mouse relative to an element you mean?
[17:59:07] <cwek> well, I have an div (let's call it container). The inside that container I have another div following the mouse. It works perfectly if container is not rotated. Now I'm trying to figure how to make it work if container is rotated. I hope you can understand what I'm trying to say. My english is not very good
[17:59:30] <robertmaxrees> mae a fiddle :)
[18:01:02] <cwek> https://jsfiddle.net/a3s3yrz9/
[18:01:33] <arc_> strange
[18:03:23] <robertmaxrees> that makes sense.  your math is in relation to the document being normally positioned. then you rotate the element but keep the same logic.
[18:11:52] <Saint_Isidore> hello, just studying up on basic jquery and wondering why with this small code $('#next').on('click', nextslide); nextslide is a function. Why do I not need to include the () at the end?
[18:12:08] <robertmaxrees> because you don't want the return to be assigned as the handler.
[18:12:19] <robertmaxrees> you're giving it the function to run in response to that event.
[18:12:23] <robertmaxrees> it does the () for you.
[18:13:01] <Saint_Isidore> robertmaxrees oh ok, and I supposed you would never want to pass in params when you do this type of function call?
[18:13:08] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:14:43] <Saint_Isidore> ok thanks robertmaxrees
[18:38:46] <nick818> Hi guys I have a dropdown for RSVP using bootstrap selectpicker with 2 select groups. one TBD and Not Attending and the group is the dates attending from group 1 the user can only select either TBD or NotAttending but from group 2 can select multiple dates. When the user chooses a date or dates and then clicks on TBD or Not attending the selected dates gets unchecked but not the other way around here is a jsfiddle to show my problem
[18:40:46] <robertmaxrees> that cut off fwiw.
[19:15:27] <aletory> Hi,  is:  https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js   down ??
[19:16:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:18:14] <nick818> Need help with https://jsfiddle.net/narbehmovsesian/g19rsjhf/4/ when TBD or Not Attnding is selected I can not select the dates any more
[19:30:36] <Excedrin> how do i jquery
[19:35:36] <robertmaxrees> nick818 have you tried console logging attending and making sure it's what you think it is?
[19:35:43] <robertmaxrees> Excedrin what do you mean?
[19:37:41] <nick818> <robertmaxrees> yes but the problem is that when TBD or Not attending is selected the dates select group does not do anything I need to unselect the TBD or not attending then choose dates
[19:40:30] <robertmaxrees> so what do you see happening then?
[19:40:33] <robertmaxrees> like, when you debug it.
[19:43:04] <nick818> <robertmaxrees> id the TBD or Not attending is selected the log does not show anything
[19:43:25] <robertmaxrees> nick818 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g19rsjhf/6/
[19:43:27] <robertmaxrees> here's a clue.
[19:43:29] <nick818> <robertmaxrees> but if I uncheck the TBD or Not attending then chose a date I see the value for the date
[19:43:57] <Excedrin> robertmaxrees: nothing in particular, I'm clueless about clientside web stuff, trying to figure things out but it's not ez
[19:44:40] <robertmaxrees> Excedrin okay - so you want a basic guide?
[19:45:13] <nick818> <robertmaxrees> my problem is thatwhen TBD or not attending is selected and then if i choose a date i need the TBD or Not attending to be unselected and the chosen date be selected
[19:45:28] <robertmaxrees> nick818 i know what your problem is - i'm showing you how to troubleshoot it.
[19:45:41] <nick818> <robertmaxrees> just like now if you choose a date first and then click on TBD it will deselect the date and select the TBD
[19:46:00] <nick818> <robertmaxrees> ok sure thank you man
[19:46:01] <robertmaxrees> yoiu're repeating yourself... i know what the problem is - i'm shoiwng you how to debug it.
[19:48:15] <robertmaxrees> Excedrin there's a LOT of stuff to learn.  i'd start with HTML and CSS>
[19:49:38] <nick818> <robertmaxrees> now when either TBD or not attending is selected and then if i chose a date it returns the last selected value
[19:49:52] <robertmaxrees> right.  do you see why?
[19:50:31] <Excedrin> yeah, I kinda get that stuff; I have a python program that produces json output (running under wsgiserver) that I'm making $.getJSON requests against; and I'm putting the results of that into a ractive.js thing and rendering it, but adding an onclick to the template doesn't do what I'd like it to do
[19:51:23] <nick818> <robertmaxrees> no
[19:52:39] <robertmaxrees> Excedrin in that case, you need to setup a delegated event listener.
[19:53:08] <robertmaxrees> nick818 $(this).find(':selected') isn't what you think it is.
[19:53:38] <robertmaxrees> if you pick tbd or not attending, you break your conditionals later on.
[19:53:39] <Excedrin> thanks, I'll look into those
[19:54:26] <robertmaxrees> nick818 your logic in that last conditional doesn't "deselect" anything else.
[19:54:41] <robertmaxrees> also: this is a really convoluted way to do this.
[19:55:59] <robertmaxrees> you're basically repeating a bunch of work within your conditionals.
[19:57:52] <nick818> <robertmaxrees> im really new to javascript and and i need a dropdown for what im building to do what i explain and so far i have it 50% done thats why i just added what i could to get it to work
[19:58:10] <robertmaxrees> nick818 right, so now we're going to help you get it done and make it mUCH better :)
[19:58:29] <nick818> and i looked up everything online and my last resource is to put it in a fiddle and ask someone with experience
[19:58:43] <robertmaxrees> right, so now we're going to help you finish it.
[19:59:10] <nick818> <robertmaxrees> thank you i really appreciate that
[19:59:56] <robertmaxrees> so i'd start by giving those two optgroups each a class.  https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g19rsjhf/8/
[19:59:59] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[20:00:10] <robertmaxrees> also: you don't need a document reayd if you're going to use a delegated listener on the document.
[20:01:45] <Excedrin> $('#tree > ul > li') doesn't seem to select the things that I'd expect, is that (likely) because the <li> aren't present when it's firing?
[20:02:02] <robertmaxrees> Excedrin correct.
[20:02:06] <robertmaxrees> which is why you need a delegated listener.
[20:03:46] <nick818> <robertmaxrees> ok this seems clean start
[20:39:09] <jonez> greetings. I need some help with jquery.smoothState.js and I was wondering if someone here can help me
[20:39:16] <robertmaxrees> maybe they can!
[20:39:24] <robertmaxrees> ask your question - if somebody can help, they will :)
[20:39:43] <jonez> I installed it, I also have the css and the markup.
[20:40:09] <jonez> my trouble is that a form I have (a login) does not properly set opacity.
[20:40:23] <robertmaxrees> okay.  can you show us an example?
[20:40:27] <robertmaxrees> maybe in a jsfiddle?
[20:41:15] <jonez> I have a demo site
[20:41:30] <robertmaxrees> normally we like a standalone test case, but if you absolutely can't, a site is fine.
[20:41:49] <jonez> the url is http://trailersdemo.zoidtechnologies.com/ and I will /query the u/p
[20:41:56] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[20:41:59] <robertmaxrees> so yeah make a jsfiddle.
[20:42:56] <jonez> that sounds difficult
[20:43:01] <robertmaxrees> nah it's not.
[20:43:03] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy :)
[20:44:45] <robertmaxrees> o dpm
[20:44:53] <robertmaxrees> *i don't see a css file for them.
[20:45:18] <robertmaxrees> either way: https://jsfiddle.net/5kyv2k4L/
[20:45:24] <robertmaxrees> just add your custom html, js and css.
[20:45:29] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle has everything else ready to go.
[20:45:56] <jonez> the trouble is that the problem is in a transition between pages
[20:46:13] <robertmaxrees> okay.  can you put this on a publicly available location then?
[20:46:15] <jonez> I can paste the js, but the html actually needs to be split into at least two pieces
[20:46:28] <jonez> I will remove the http u/p if that will help
[20:46:28] <robertmaxrees> i really don't like being sent private credentials :/
[20:46:32] <robertmaxrees> sure
[20:46:36] <jonez> ok hold please
[20:47:41] <jonez> robbyoconnor, the url I posted previously.. please try to load it and let me know if it works :)
[20:47:48] <robertmaxrees> wrong userna,e.
[20:47:49] <robertmaxrees> and okay.
[20:47:58] <robertmaxrees> works.  now what?
[20:48:07] <jonez> click on the "login" link in the top bar
[20:48:16] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[20:48:43] <robertmaxrees> and then?
[20:48:55] <jonez> it doesn't fade up properly
[20:49:03] <robertmaxrees> okay.  where's your code for this?
[20:49:06] <jonez> it looks "grayed out"
[20:49:18] <jonez> the js is in ssi.js
[20:50:34] <robertmaxrees> and you have the keyframes setup correctly?
[20:50:51] <robertmaxrees> i assume you were going for something like http://smoothstate.com/demos/typical/index.html ?
[20:51:42] <jonez> robertmaxrees, yes at firsty
[20:51:59] <jonez> let me check if I have the right keyframes file
[20:52:08] <robertmaxrees> http://smoothstate.com/typical-implementation.html - follow the "adding page transitions" bit.
[20:52:14] <robertmaxrees> because i don't see you doing that.
[20:54:44] <robertmaxrees> ah, this uses ajax to load things.
[20:54:51] <jonez> yes
[20:54:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, your issue looks like it's largely about bad styles.
[20:54:58] <jonez> phew :P)
[20:55:01] <jonez> er.. :)
[20:55:01] <robertmaxrees> fixing that should solve everything else.
[20:57:15] <jonez> ok I'll try
[21:28:44] <Mark__> guys,
[21:28:48] <Mark__> is there a way i can use show()
[21:28:51] <Mark__> with fade in effect?
[21:29:03] <Mark__> i’ve tried show(200) but it’s not exactly the same effect.
[22:08:00] <b4b> dont know where to ask this but is there a decent javascript jvm?
[23:18:24] <koolsterr> hey I'm trying to do something like var {first, second} = {O:"first",B:"second,C:"third"}; and im getting error, can someone tell me what rule of deconstruction I'm violating http://www.2ality.com/2015/01/es6-destructuring.html
[23:19:12] <yelsneh> var {first, second} = {O:"first",B:"second",C:"third"};
[23:19:15] <yelsneh> missing a quote
[23:19:54] <koolsterr> yeah i have format correct, should this work though?
[23:20:48] <koolsterr> i mean i have something similar and i'm getting error, just making sure deconstruction format should work
[23:25:27] <koolsterr> ok, nm I found error point
