[00:00:07] <eddiemonge> cat3: what do you need the id for?
[00:00:46] <cat3> eddiemonge: I want to use the ID in the popover title
[00:01:03] <cat3> also - to pass it in as a parameter to the function that constructs the popover content
[00:01:29] <cat3> here's the use case - I have 100 buttons that each have a popover. i dont want to needlessly replicate code
[00:01:45] <Cork> cat3: just show you're code
[00:01:52] <cat3> Cork: i'm preparing it :)
[00:02:04] <Cork> that will explain better what you want to do
[00:02:14] * dblosevn prepares a beer for drinking
[00:02:42] <Morthez_> dblosevn: that's to early :-p (atleast here in Europe :-p)
[00:06:53] <cat3> http://jsfiddle.net/zE5NP/5/
[00:06:59] <cat3> thanks in advance for any help, guys
[00:07:52] <Cork> that's not possible
[00:08:12] <Cork> you would have to loop each element if you want to do that
[00:08:33] <cat3> oh :( so I need to create a new popover() function for each element?
[00:08:40] <Cork> yes
[00:08:56] <cat3> alright - thanks Cork!
[00:09:08] <Cork> {} isn't a function so its not called like that
[00:09:18] <tw2113> or select by the ID perhaps?
[00:09:27] <Cork> na
[00:09:29] <tw2113> but you'd still have to type it all out by hand
[00:09:42] <Cork> it would be more code
[00:09:48] <cat3> I can have PHP create the functions for me. I was looking for a more elegant way to do it though
[00:10:14] <Cork> cat3: check if popover can take a function for title
[00:10:44] <cat3> cork: it indeed can!
[00:11:02] <Cork> then you can solve it without each
[00:19:47] <anli__> Are the CanExecute methods run by a timer or something?
[00:19:52] <anli__> They seeem to run constantly
[00:20:03] <Cork> CanExecute?
[00:20:09] <Cork> in what library?
[00:20:22] <SlexAxton> ?CanExecute

[00:20:45] <SlexAxton> I don't think any of that is jQuery, right?
[00:20:49] <Cork> nope
[00:20:50] <anli__> wow, sorry
[00:20:53] <anli__> :)
[00:21:01] <anli__> I go the right channel then
[00:31:23] <sheilablackrose> hi cork are you there
[00:33:21] <sheilablackrose> i modified a code but im stuck
[00:33:22] <sheilablackrose> http://pastebin.com/gqYWMpPR
[00:33:35] <sheilablackrose> the thing goes haywire when i add a lable
[00:43:44] <ravenzz> sheilablackrose this is jquery not css :)
[00:45:16] <Cork> sheilablackrose: http://jsfiddle.net/ASLCp/1/
[00:45:36] <sheilablackrose> i know but cork is good with this stuff
[00:46:12] <ravenzz> this won't work in IE7/8 btw
[00:46:59] <Cork> ravenzz: works just fine
[00:47:05] <ravenzz> no dude
[00:47:11] <crooksey_> I am trying to run a jsfiddle locally (playing around with sortable drag and drops between divs) I have seen the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/jhogervorst/CPA5Y/ which I have converted to http://dpaste.com/843954/ yet none of the dragging or sorting abilities work, have I missed anything?
[00:47:13] <Cork> you want a screen shot?
[00:47:16] <ravenzz> the :checked pseudo class is not supported
[00:47:23] <ravenzz> maybe you are in compatible mode
[00:47:43] <Cork> na forgot i updated this vm :)
[00:48:12] <sheilablackrose> Cork this is what i did
[00:48:22] <sheilablackrose> basically the image n everything is there n i can click
[00:48:30] <sheilablackrose> but i cant add any label i want it to be beside the image
[00:48:43] <sheilablackrose> this image is just the box
[00:48:52] <sheilablackrose> n another is the box with a tick
[00:48:56] <Cork> sheilablackrose: you need to add padding for the image
[00:49:01] <Cork> and have the text beside it
[00:49:15] <Cork> let me see if i can find a tutorial
[00:49:19] <sheilablackrose> but when i add padding the i mage gets tiled
[00:49:24] <sheilablackrose> image gets tiled
[00:50:17] <Cork> ya, its the background image
[00:50:37] <Cork> you might want to have the image in an extra element ex. a span inside the label
[00:51:01] <sheilablackrose> is there somewhere i can put a screen shot?
[00:51:12] <sheilablackrose> i can post a screen shot
[00:51:31] <Cork> sheilablackrose: its better if you can put the code in the fiddle
[00:51:48] <sheilablackrose> yup i did now i want to show you what im tryig to do
[00:51:53] <sheilablackrose> can paste bin put screenshots
[00:51:54] <sheilablackrose> ?
[00:51:56] <sheilablackrose> can i pv u?
[00:52:00] <Cork> just save the page
[00:52:05] <Cork> and post the url here
[00:52:24] <ravenzz> if you are on chrome you could use awesomescreenshot (a browser extension)
[00:52:36] <Lucky--> is this the default json serializer? "ï¿½*ï¿½_timezone";s:2:"
[00:53:01] <Cork> Lucky--: did you ask that in the correct channel?
[00:53:11] <Cork> that looks like ruby
[00:53:12] <Lucky--> yea,
[00:53:18] <Lucky--> yea thats what im thinking
[00:53:20] <Cork> the you're answer is no
[00:53:25] <Cork> *then
[00:53:37] <Lucky--> s:{{[{i:0,O:41:"Model_Entity_Campaign_ActionAfterDelivery": {
[00:53:50] <Cork> ya, thats a serialized ruby hash
[00:54:08] <Cork> oh wait no
[00:54:16] <Cork> its a serialized ruby string of json :)
[00:54:22] <Lucky--> thx, i had a service i paid for and they went under, and it was lob crucial, so i found a backup of a cfg but it was base64 encoded
[00:54:29] <Cork> or something like that
[00:54:48] <Lucky--> so i base64 decoded it and am now trying to deserialize it, i dev .net/js no ruby, so i was like "hmm, looks wierd"
[00:55:37] <Cork> ?g ruby serialize

[00:56:20] <sheilablackrose> http://postimage.org/image/nz1mhssrp/12515744/    this is what i want the checkbox to look like n this is th eimage i have http://postimage.org/image/fqa3qh56n/ff928029/
[00:56:36] <Lucky--> ugggh ruby is fugly
[00:56:50] <Cork> sheilablackrose: so you need to have the image in its own element
[00:57:27] <sheilablackrose> ok so without + label
[00:57:27] <sheilablackrose> ?
[00:57:53] <Cork> no
[00:58:05] <Cork> you need to add an additional element inside label for the image
[00:58:39] <Cork> so that you can separate the images dimensions from the text
[00:58:49] <sheilablackrose> can you tel lme how
[00:58:53] <Cork> sheilablackrose: alternatively don't use spliced images
[00:58:59] <Cork> i just did...
[00:59:29] <sheilablackrose> too advance!
[00:59:55] <Cork> adding an element setting width + height and its background image is too advanced?
[01:00:23] * Lucky-- tries to remember where i installed node
[01:01:01] <sheilablackrose> i added backgroundsize
[01:01:42] <Cork> background-size can't help you with a spliced image
[01:01:54] <Cork> that just scales the hole image
[01:02:36] <sheilablackrose> ok let me try using just width
[01:02:40] <Cork> and background-image has poor backwards compatibility
[01:03:52] <sheilablackrose> so what do you sugest i do?
[01:04:05] <Cork> uh
[01:04:21] <Cork> "add an additional element with the image as background"
[01:04:41] <xec> "background-image has poor backwards compatibility" really?
[01:04:49] <Cork> no backgorund-size
[01:04:54] <Cork> *background-size
[01:04:56] <xec> ah
[01:05:02] <xec> indeed
[01:05:20] <sheilablackrose> sorry how do i add an aditional element with image?
[01:05:45] <xec> <div class="myElement"></div>
[01:05:50] <ravenzz> ..
[01:05:52] <xec> you can have that code for free from me
[01:06:03] <ravenzz> are you still talking about these checkboxes :p?
[01:06:04] <xec> just paste it where you want it
[01:06:07] <sheilablackrose> yup
[01:06:08] <Cork> yes...
[01:06:16] <sheilablackrose> im confused as hell
[01:06:16] <ravenzz> sheilablackrose what is the problem?
[01:06:30] <Cork> ravenzz: he/she uses spliced images
[01:06:40] <sheilablackrose> im trying to customize a checkbox
[01:06:42] <xec> sprites
[01:06:44] <ravenzz> if he/she has vertical sprites
[01:06:48] <sheilablackrose> yeah using spliced
[01:06:50] <ravenzz> it shouldn't be a problem
[01:07:01] <ravenzz> OOr with pseudo-elements
[01:07:24] <sheilablackrose> im at a level where i dont know what ooR is
[01:07:36] <ravenzz> sheilablackrose anyway I have a link to an article that explains how to do that
[01:07:37] <sheilablackrose> total newbie
[01:07:38] <ravenzz> hold on
[01:07:44] <sheilablackrose> awesome
[01:08:40] <sheilablackrose> Cork when u say another element you meant div?
[01:08:58] <Cork> i meant an element of your choice
[01:09:15] <Cork> p, b, div, span, strong, ...
[01:09:58] <ravenzz> you shouldn't mess up with your markup in order to add fancyness imo
[01:10:05] <ravenzz> anyway here is the tutorial http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201211/accessible_custom_checkboxes_and_radio_buttons/
[01:10:42] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[01:11:13] <ravenzz> since form fields are inline level elems i would wrap everything in spans instead of divs
[01:11:44] <ravenzz> and fix small stuffs but the article is quite alright
[01:12:48] <sheilablackrose> ic
[01:14:09] <xec> sheilablackrose: http://jsfiddle.net/dxR8h/
[01:14:39] <xec> works in chrome (tm)
[01:15:04] <xec> but no go in ff/ie :D
[01:16:26] <ravenzz> xec it is not a big deal
[01:16:42] <ravenzz> considering that also :checked is not supported by ie7/8
[01:17:00] <Demonen> Just use <label/>?
[01:20:56] <crooksey_> I am trying to run a jsfiddle locally (playing around with sortable drag and drops between divs) I have seen the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/jhogervorst/CPA5Y/ which I have converted to http://dpaste.com/843954/ yet none of the dragging or sorting abilities work, have I missed anything?
[01:20:57] <sheilablackrose> xec - i have two images before n after but there are spliced image
[01:24:45] <aqeel> hi room
[01:24:48] <aqeel> top: -o.width >> 1,
[01:24:53] <aqeel> how to replace >>
[01:26:25] <faraway> crooksey_: not completly sure if you need the jquery-ui stylesheet to get it working. but that one is missing
[01:27:22] <crooksey_> faraway: thanks, should it have a document ready?
[01:27:44] <crooksey_> All i have done is copied the code there into one file and linked the libaries in
[01:27:46] <faraway> crooksey_: ah yes .. sorry i missed that
[01:28:00] <aqeel> x<<y is equavalent to x * 2^y, so x>>y must be mathematically equavilant to something
[01:28:18] <crooksey_> faraway: ive tried to add it in, but might be doing it wrong, how should my <scirpt></script> look?
[01:28:41] <faraway> crooksey_: the time you do query for $(".dragable") there is no element to be found with that class
[01:29:07] <crooksey_> faraway: Yea, but its working code from jsfiddle >.<
[01:29:53] <faraway> crooksey_: because "onLoad" is selected for time of execution of the script
[01:30:23] <xec> sheilablackrose: i just gave it an attempt without a seperate element, if you follow the instructions in the link from ravenzz you should be fine ;)
[01:30:25] <faraway> crooksey_: didn't check for any syntax error, but it should look like this http://dpaste.com/843982/
[01:31:05] <faraway> crooksey_: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[01:33:30] <crooksey_> faraway: thanks, did that work for you locally?
[01:34:10] <faraway> crooksey_: i can't test it right now
[01:35:20] <faraway> aqeel: isn't x>>1    Math.floor(x/2) ?
[01:36:11] <crooksey_> faraway: ok thanks for all the help :)
[01:36:21] <Cork> faraway: no >> crops at 32bit too
[01:36:47] <aqeel> yup it does crop at 32 bits
[01:37:23] <aqeel> i am finding the logic the bitwise operators follow
[01:38:07] <aqeel> ~ = -(x+1) and x<<y =x*2^y and few more
[01:38:33] <aqeel> so what would this be >> any ideas..
[01:39:32] <aqeel> or any function that gives the result of this behaviour...
[01:40:02] <Cork> aqeel: Math.floor(x/2) should prob be good enough
[01:40:27] <Cork> i just meant its not the same
[01:41:00] <aqeel> i know ....what you meant....but it somehow provide the nearest solution
[01:41:19] <Cork> what do you mean?
[01:42:24] <aqeel> Math.floor(x/2) is simple mathematics formula which do not take into account the 32 bit part
[01:42:44] <Cork> and you really need that?
[01:43:27] <aqeel> well trying to learn the alternatives, and all possible solutions if possible at all
[01:43:48] <aqeel> jslint do not like bitwise operators..
[01:44:04] <aqeel> and i want to learn too, as how the botwise opearators function
[01:44:11] <aqeel> bitwise*
[01:44:38] <seutje> lint doesn't like it, only because lots of ppl don't know how to work them, and lint just assumes you maketh a typo
[01:44:55] <Cork> ya
[01:45:03] <aqeel> so it is good to learn
[01:45:07] <Cork> lint sucks at some parts
[01:45:20] <aqeel> cannot be much more xgreed
[01:45:25] <sheilablackrose> thansk guys for everything
[01:45:25] <seutje> I'll admit I'm one of those who don't know how to work them :P
[01:45:26] <sheilablackrose> good night
[01:45:26] <aqeel> agreed*
[01:45:32] <Cork> you would have to do numeric comparisons
[01:45:43] <faraway> aqeel: Math.floor(x/2)$0xFFFFFFFFFF
[01:45:54] <Cork> thats till bitwize :)
[01:46:12] <faraway> aqeel: Math.floor(x/2)&&0xFFFFFFFFFF
[01:46:16] <faraway> aqeel: Math.floor(x/2)&0xFFFFFFFFFF
[01:46:19] <faraway> sorry :D
[01:46:29] <aqeel> flags
[01:46:37] <Cork> and isn't 0xFFFFFFFFFF too big?
[01:46:45] <Cork> that expects unsigned
[01:47:55] <aqeel> borderRadius: (o.corners * o.width >> 1) + 'px'
[01:47:56] <faraway> Cork, aqeel: oh yes sorry ... should be 8  F's
[01:48:18] <aqeel> yes must be hex
[01:48:39] <Cork> it should be 0x7fffffff
[01:49:42] <Cork> on the other hand bitwise doesn't support signed either...
[01:49:45] <aqeel> so what does >> do in my line of code
[01:49:46] <faraway> Cork: no (34234234234234234234/2)&0x7FFFFFFF  = 1619406848    ,   (34234234234234234234/2)&0xFFFFFFFF = -528076800  , 34234234234234234234>>1  = -528076800
[01:49:49] <Cork> so ya 8 should be correct
[01:50:20] <faraway> Cork: 0x7.... is for >>>
[01:50:26] * Cork nods
[01:50:32] <Cork> does >>> exist in js?
[01:50:36] <aqeel> borderRadius: (o.corners * o.width >> 1) + 'px'.....please explain >>
[01:50:50] <faraway> Cork: at least in chrome  ... never used it in js
[01:51:31] <Cork> faraway: chrome doesn't have a special engine
[01:51:36] <Cork> its just 1.5 compliant
[01:52:06] <Cork> sm/tm is the only one i know of that supports above 1.5
[01:52:15] <Cork> (its at 1.8)
[01:53:08] <aqeel> why would someone need that in border radius??
[01:53:17] <Cork> aqeel: are you sure that the one that did that line actually expect 32bit limit?
[01:53:19] <aqeel> borderRadius: (o.corners * o.width >> 1) + 'px'
[01:53:29] <Cork> i'm not convinced
[01:53:32] <aqeel> it is in plugin
[01:53:34] <toooni> hi everybody.. i don't know if this is the right channel here.. but i have a problem.. i do have a page with a product filter on it.. the filter gets new contents/products via ajax request... now when i click on a product and want to go back.. the filter isn't set in google chrome (firefox does show the modified page.. but google chrome just shows the page like it was before the ajax request).. does anybody around here know why that is?
[01:53:59] <aqeel> let me fiddle the code..
[01:54:08] <Cork> aqeel: they want the rounding of the element to be proportional to the size of the element
[01:54:16] <toooni> btw. with "go back" i mean pressing the history back button..
[01:54:34] <Cork> aqeel: its just a corners * width / 2
[01:54:51] <Cork> i don't think the 32bit limit is thought of, and won't prob ever be hit
[01:54:57] <faraway> aqeel: i can't tell for js but in other languages a x >> 1 is faster then a floor(x/2) because it is just on instruction on the cpu.
[01:55:08] <aqeel> true
[01:55:10] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/7pYkr/
[01:55:14] <Cork> ya, it's faster
[01:55:19] <Cork> but i don't think it matter much
[01:55:33] <Cork> this is for a pref it doesn't run that much
[01:55:43] <aqeel> it is a spinner plugin
[01:56:52] <Cork> and if << is faster then math.floor( / 2) is hard to tell cause of jit
[01:56:58] <aqeel> the guy have used >> at quite a few places
[01:57:50] <faraway> aqeel: my guess .. the guy is just used to do it that way and it has no special reason
[01:58:49] <aqeel> i was hoping the same...else why need bitwise at all
[02:00:53] <aqeel> so i can change the bit-wise to regular expressions, ??
[02:01:23] <crooksey_> faraway: I cant see why that code you gave me wont work, would I need to change any of the other code to get it working?
[02:02:58] <aqeel> so according to your experience and programming, what would be the opinion for >> operator ? should i let it be as it is or better have it changed?
[02:03:54] <aqeel> faraway: and cork ^^
[02:05:48] <faraway> crooksey_: if you just do a copy and paste there is an invisible ILLIGAL token .... }); [ILLIGAL TOKEN]  )}; </script>
[02:06:22] <aqeel> thanks everyone,
[02:06:22] <crooksey_> faraway: really? I have done it before to demo code
[02:06:39] <aqeel> got to go office is off, byr room
[02:07:00] <faraway> crooksey_: look in the console of you browser .. that was at least the problem when i tested it localy
[02:09:08] <crooksey_> faraway: kk thanks
[02:09:14] <crooksey_> I have it working on fiddle
[02:09:37] <Cork> i keep wondering what editor it is that keeps adding these invisible characters
[02:09:59] <Cork> its a surprisingly common problem
[02:10:26] <seutje> pastebin does that sometimes
[02:10:45] <seutje> which seems a bit silly, since it's sorta made for coads
[02:10:55] <Cork> :)
[02:11:06] <Cork> pb isn't really meant for code
[02:11:18] <Cork> its meant for most anything text based
[02:11:32] <seutje> why does it offer syntax hilighting then?
[02:11:34] <Cork> (just look at the hacker groups ;P )
[02:11:37] <seutje> highlighting*
[02:11:47] <Cork> cause its a nice feature to have for pasted text
[02:11:55] <seutje> smells like coads
[02:13:33] <crooksey_> faraway: sorted, thanks, my console showed me offending line :D
[02:14:34] <seutje> this feels a bit messed up: using PHP to build an HTML string containing JavaScript :(
[02:15:11] <Cork> :s
[02:15:24] <faraway> Cork: of the time it is the problem if you copy from utf-8 to non utf-8 or if you forget to add the corresponding encoding
[02:15:29] <faraway> most ...
[02:15:34] <Cork> seutje: do you prefer using php to generate html putting it in string in js? :D
[02:15:51] <faraway> here is was also an unicode sequence for zero length space
[02:15:55] <Hooloovoo> hmm... should i clean up eventlisteners before i remove a element?
[02:15:57] <Cork> ah
[02:15:59] <Hooloovoo> or is that automatic?
[02:16:03] <Cork> automatic
[02:16:09] <seutje> Cork: iono lol
[02:16:10] <MeMReS> messed up? nah.. innovative.. ;)
[02:16:14] <seutje> lesse rof 2 evils?
[02:16:16] <Hooloovoo> Cork: sweet, thanks.
[02:16:18] <seutje> lesser of*
[02:17:07] <Cork> seutje: the biggest problem i find is when i want to send both js and html over an ajax connection
[02:17:32] <seutje> Cork: yeah, trying to avoid that by putting a template in the page
[02:17:32] <Cork> i wish there could be a multi part message for ajax :D
[02:17:55] <Cork> seutje: that only woks if the different calls does the same thing
[02:18:16] <seutje> yeah this project only has 1 type of data calls
[02:18:24] <Cork> but if you ex. use ajax to speed up page loads (as the dom doens't have to be teared down/rebuilt) you're in a bit of a spot
[02:18:28] <seutje> it's a big ass data table, all sortable and shit
[02:18:47] <Cork> you would basically have to have all pages in one gigantic page
[02:19:08] <seutje> the data comes from an external API, and I warned them about pulling in 1000s of records, but they noticed the perf impact only yesterday
[02:19:25] <seutje> so I', restructuring some stuff so I can use the same data format for rendering on the backend and frontend
[02:20:01] <Cork> infinite scroll some searching and sorting makes that work really well
[02:20:11] <Cork> at least to my experience
[02:20:28] <r500> http://jsfiddle.net/Sjm3A/11/ the div doesnt slide here properly  ; but here  http://jsfiddle.net/Sjm3A/9/ work. i want to give id of div instead of next
[02:20:31] <seutje> so I'm just adding a call that'll pull in additional data, as they can only ever see 100 records at once anyway
[02:20:47] <Cork> lol ah :)
[02:20:57] <seutje> so initial page call grab 100, on ready the next 100 are fetched, when those are viewed, the next 100 are fetched, ...
[02:21:27] <Cork> r500: you're missing the div_block element ;)
[02:21:28] <seutje> now let's see how IE7 on a pentium 2 handles tearing down and rebuilding a table with 100 rows :D
[02:21:32] <Cork> # <--
[02:22:14] <Cork> well you don't have to tear down the entire table, just remove the rows
[02:22:22] <Cork> and ie handles that fairly well actually
[02:22:40] <r500> Cork:  oops.. silly me
[02:22:47] <seutje> well, I'm not gonna optimize unless there's a problem
[02:22:48] <r500> http://jsfiddle.net/Sjm3A/12/ working
[02:22:50] <r500> :D
[02:22:52] <seutje> not going down that road again :P
[02:23:00] <Cork> heh
[02:23:30] <MeMReS> r500: ever use TweenLite JS?
[02:23:39] <seutje> on the other hand, I have like the rest of the week to finish only this...
[02:24:52] <r500> MeMReS:  nope wats tat
[02:24:57] <r500> ill google
[02:25:03] <bladicito> hi there
[02:25:10] <bladicito> i need some help :-)
[02:25:18] <bladicito> what does this mean`?
[02:25:20] <bladicito> SyntaxError: invalid label [Break On This Error] 	  {"status":"ok","lastName":"dddd","firstName":"dddd"}
[02:25:36] <bladicito> i am sending back this data from the server to the ajax call
[02:25:49] <bladicito> and i have no clue why i am getting this
[02:25:51] <shoky> did you put that in a blank JS line
[02:25:52] <shoky> or something
[02:25:53] <Cork> that you have something in you're json thats not valid
[02:26:19] <Cork> heh or ya, that :)
[02:26:54] <shoky> for example:
[02:27:00] <shoky> function zz() {  return
[02:27:03] <shoky>  {"status":"ok","lastName":"dddd","firstName":"dddd"}  }
[02:27:06] <bladicito> success:function(response){ 				var status = response.status; 				alert(status)      		},
[02:27:06] <shoky> ;]
[02:27:12] <bladicito> i have something like this
[02:27:45] <Cork> bladicito: what is ajax expecting back?
[02:27:52] <Cork> what content-type are the server sending?
[02:27:55] <bladicito> jsonp
[02:28:05] <bladicito> is a crossdomain request
[02:28:07] <Cork> it expects jsonp and gets json?
[02:28:08] <shoky> the server needs to know how to respond with JSONP
[02:28:26] <shoky> if it just returns JSON then that explains it
[02:28:32] <bladicito> echo json_encode($response);
[02:28:40] <shoky> not good.
[02:28:45] <Cork> ya that gives you json
[02:28:46] <shoky> not for jsonp
[02:28:47] <Cork> not jsonp
[02:28:50] <bladicito> i have this on the php, in whoch $response is an array
[02:29:03] <shoky> you should read about JSONP and how the server needs to respond
[02:29:17] <bladicito> ok yep, that is what i was thinking on
[02:29:30] <shoky> basically  it needs to take the callback name that is passed to it as 'callback' param
[02:29:42] <shoky> and put that as a function call with the JSON object as argument
[02:29:50] <Cork> function <?php echo $_GET['callback']:; %>() { return <?php echo json_encode($response); ?> };
[02:29:52] <shoky> like:   callbackName({the json obj})
[02:29:58] <shoky> there you go.
[02:30:04] <Cork> *function <?php echo $_GET['callback']; %>() { return <?php echo json_encode($response); ?> };
[02:30:13] <shoky> no you don't need function
[02:30:20] <shoky> it's just a function call
[02:30:23] <shoky> not a function declaration
[02:30:34] <shoky> no?
[02:30:43] <Cork> i'm quite sure jquery expects a function
[02:30:48] <shoky> huh
[02:30:52] <shoky> that doesn't make sense at all
[02:31:03] <bladicito> heheh
[02:31:11] <veQue> @_@
[02:31:15] <shoky> jquery is the one defining the callback
[02:31:26] <shoky> and the returned script is just a call to the callback
[02:31:52] <Cork> ?jsonp
[02:32:10] <bladicito> so it would be correct only to echo back the array jsonFIED
[02:32:38] <shoky> this is what i think:    <?php echo $_GET['callback']; %>(<?php echo json_encode($response); ?>);
[02:33:13] <Cork> man i can't find jquery's documentation for it at the moment
[02:33:36] <bladicito> oks thanks i will take a look to it
[02:33:38] <bladicito> thanksss
[02:34:33] <veQue> I'm basically done with first jquery related project. but since jquery is pretty cool i'm googling cool stuff to do with jquery
[02:35:24] <veQue> =)
[02:35:50] <shoky> from $.ajax docs:  The jsonp type appends a query string parameter of callback=? to the URL. The server should prepend the JSON data with the callback name to form a valid JSONP response.
[02:35:54] <catamit3> hi folks! a noob question for y'all
[02:36:19] <catamit3> when declaring a function within a queue, how can I pass in a parameter?
[02:38:06] <shoky> catamit3: what do you mean, within a queue?
[02:39:05] <catamit3> eg $('#myelement').on('click', function()); how do I pass a param into that function?
[02:39:13] <catamit3> forgive me - I'm a boorish PHP programmer :(
[02:39:26] <shoky> usually you don't need to
[02:39:28] <shoky> but it's possible..
[02:39:29] <NodeX> param?
[02:39:34] <shoky> are you sure you need to do that?
[02:40:18] <catamit3> NodeX: parameter
[02:40:28] <NodeX> yes i got that
[02:40:34] <NodeX> define what param you mean
[02:40:47] <Cork> shoky: jquery doesn't define the function
[02:41:00] <Cork> all it does is window[callbackName]()
[02:41:04] <catamit3> in this use case, the click function creates a popup, which needs to create elements based on that param
[02:41:25] <shoky> Cork: waaat. lemme see.
[02:41:27] <NodeX> most people attach it as data into the element that was clicked
[02:41:37] <NodeX> which is $(this) inside the function
[02:42:34] <shoky> Cork:  // Install callback  window[ callbackName ] = function() { responseContainer = arguments; };
[02:42:43] <Cork> O_o
[02:43:06] <Cork> heh
[02:43:09] <shoky> where do you see a call to it
[02:43:17] <Cork> ya, totally missed that one
[02:43:36] <Cork> down in // Call if it was a function and we have a response
[02:43:42] <catamit3> NodeX: that may work. and I feel stupid for not thinking about it. but its still less elegant as I'll need to write another HTML attribute
[02:44:06] <NodeX> where would you like the param to live?
[02:44:09] <Cork> shoky: but this code has changed a lot since last i looked at it
[02:44:36] <shoky> yea that's only a call to the overwritten function if there was one
[02:44:59] <Cork> ya
[02:45:10] <shoky> Cork: but it doesnt make sense that it was ever like you said.. because JSONP responses have been the same from the start afaik
[02:45:13] <catamit3> heres a brief breakdown. a HTML button exists with an attribute. clicking it will trigger a popup, with another HTML button. clicking that should trigger XYZ, but it needs the original attribute
[02:45:56] <NodeX> data-trigger="XYZ" .... $(this).data('trigger'); ---- that's your best option
[02:46:16] <NodeX> (replace with your own names obviously)
[02:46:37] <catamit3> nodex: will do exactly this. Thanks!
[02:46:46] <NodeX> ;)
[02:46:50] <NodeX> quick tip
[02:47:03] <NodeX> don't use camel case in data-attribUtes
[02:47:09] <NodeX> it sends things crazy
[02:47:39] <catamit3> i use camel case solely for function names :X
[02:47:50] <catamit3> thanks for thet ip
[02:47:52] <NodeX> :D
[02:49:39] <Cork> shoky: there is always one overwritten = window[ callbackName ];
[02:50:00] <shoky> Cork:  but unless you defined it earlier it'll be undefined
[02:50:18] <jnhghy> Hi, I'm trying to make a greeting card using jquery to show it on page load and dismiss it after click. Issue: I get Uncaught TypeError: Object #overlay has no method "fadeIn" anybody ?
[02:50:46] <Cork> ah
[02:51:08] <NodeX> check what "#overlay" is
[02:51:21] <NodeX> it looks like a selector and not a jquery object
[02:51:24] <Cork> shoky: btw looking at modern ajax code for jsonp is a lot easier to follow then the old one
[02:51:56] <Cork> shoky: i see that i read it wrong back then, but i have a hard time following it now too :)
[02:51:57] <Cork> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.2.3.js
[02:52:31] <shoky> lol
[02:53:36] <shoky> im thankful to have only started seriously around 1.6-1.7 ;]
[02:53:53] <Cork> i started at 1.1 :s
[02:53:58] <Cork> that was hell
[02:54:13] <jnhghy> NodeX: #overlay is a div in my html that covers the screen and triggers the fadein of the image of the greeting
[02:54:21] <Cork> but i barely touched it back then; was more forced feed :)
[02:54:27] <shoky> back then i was probably busy making IE6-only apps ;D
[02:54:33] <Cork> (and old drupal site)
[02:54:38] <Cork> heh
[02:54:50] <Cork> i've never done ie only sites since ie4
[02:55:01] <shoky> heh
[02:55:15] <Cork> i've swore a lot over it back then though :D
[02:55:53] <shoky> if only there were google trends for how much people swear over stuff
[02:55:59] <Cork> lol
[02:56:22] <Cork> if only there was google stats for how many man decades has been spent on ie bugs
[02:56:56] <Cork> (collectively for web developers)
[02:57:19] <Cork> and heck competing browser developers
[02:57:32] <NodeX> jnhghy : I would say then that your script is not selecting it properly
[02:57:35] <shoky> ;]
[02:57:40] <NodeX> and or referencing it
[02:58:12] <jnhghy> NodeX: hmm... I seems that #overlay has no height .... I guess this is where I need to debug..
[02:58:13] <veQue> hey ever feel there was too much to learn and didnt know where to start?
[02:58:35] <veQue> i guess i can just go thru random tutorials on more jquery stuff
[02:58:43] <klawd> veQue: i know the feel
[02:58:50] <veQue> any recommendations before i go off on a safari on my own?
[02:58:56] <Cork> veQue: normally the best end to start is the end, get something thats working and start fiddeling and work your way down
[02:59:02] <veQue> a jquery tut safari
[02:59:20] <veQue> good advice
[02:59:23] <klawd> veQue: do you just want to learn so you can put it on a resume or something?
[02:59:47] <veQue> klawd , to be honest i just like knowing for the skill itself
[02:59:53] <klawd> huh
[02:59:57] <veQue> sure i can throw it on a resume
[03:00:07] <veQue> but i dont nessicarily have to
[03:00:23] <klawd> veQue: i always learn a skill when i need it
[03:00:35] <klawd> like: i need an animation on a site: i'll look up how to do it
[03:00:42] <veQue> klawd i were afraid you may say something like that
[03:00:47] <veQue> i was feeling the ame way
[03:00:53] <veQue> same
[03:01:00] <klawd> veQue: doesn't necessarily mean that that is for you. it's just what i do
[03:01:23] <veQue> http://dzineblog.com/2010/02/20-cool-jquery-tricks-for-web-developers.html
[03:01:39] <klawd> can't hurt to have a broad theoretical skill set via tutorials but for me it's always about a goal i want to accomplish
[03:03:17] <veQue> i just come across this statement in a comments section and being new to jquery and find it cool can some one explain it? "Good menu. But too bad itâ€™s in jQuery rather than Prototype or MooTools"
[03:03:33] <greek> Hi fellas. Is it possible to store $(this) in an object called moo and then do things like moo.each(...) ?"
[03:03:47] <Cork> yes
[03:03:51] <greek> I've got a table object in moo and I want to iterate over each of its children
[03:03:53] <klawd> veQue: that's a hipster i'd guess
[03:04:06] <Cork> greek: ^
[03:04:20] <greek> But I'm not sure how to conver this $("table.moo tr").each(...) to my_table
[03:04:43] <greek> var my_table = $("table.moo");
[03:05:04] <greek> Cork am I explaining myself appropriately? I'm struggling to articulate my problem
[03:05:58] <ianjm> are you looking for something like this:
[03:06:00] <greek> I have a table of class "moo" with multiple rows. I know how to use $("table.moo tr").each(...) to iterate over moo's rows, but say I've stored the table object as follows: var moo_table = $("table.moo"); then how do I iterate over its rows using the object?
[03:06:04] <ianjm> $(tableObject).find("tr").each(...)
[03:06:28] <ianjm> or just moo_table.find("tr") if it's already a jQuery object
[03:06:45] <greek> yeah it's a jquery ojbect
[03:07:21] <ianjm> yeah, so .find essentially allows you to look at children, i think $("foo bar baz") is equivalent to $('foo').find('bar').find('baz') roughly
[03:07:34] <greek> ok cool I'll try that
[03:07:50] <Cork> you don't need the extra $() though
[03:08:04] <Cork> just do moo.find('tr').each()
[03:08:07] <ianjm> indeed like i said if it's already a jquery object, i got the impression it wasn't but i think i misunderstood.
[03:08:42] <greek> ianjm, hey that worked! Thanks so much :)
[03:08:44] <greek> Thanks also Cork
[03:08:48] <ianjm> nw greek
[03:08:50] <ianjm> happy jquerying
[03:08:53] <greek> Thanks :)
[03:12:25] <Trisox> cork
[03:12:42] <obert> what is 'jquery pos'?
[03:13:00] <Trisox> you might know this .. how do you stop a button form shifting text on mouse press in css........
[03:13:01] <obert> if it has a meaning
[03:14:00] <obert> Trisox: sorry?
[03:14:06] <greek> ianjm, I'm having a problem where it's returning all nested trs (2, 3, ... tiers down) - is there any way to limit it to just 1 tier?
[03:14:20] <greek> because my tr's in turn contain tables
[03:14:23] <greek> if that makes sense
[03:14:54] <obert> greek: hope it is not about table used for layout
[03:14:55] <catamit3> ok im officially retarded!
[03:14:56] <ianjm> ah yeah
[03:15:08] <ianjm> you could try .children(...) instead of .find(...), greek, if they're direct children
[03:15:35] <veQue> catamit3: get something to work?
[03:15:46] <ianjm> alternatively, try using > as part of the selector syntax
[03:15:54] <ianjm> like table.find("> tr");
[03:15:58] <greek> ianjm, I tried that but it returns all the children at once, ie: I can't seem to iterate over each child using .each()
[03:16:06] <ianjm> should give you direct children only, i think
[03:16:13] * veQue would  kill for a taller chair
[03:16:20] <greek> ok
[03:16:42] <greek> nope doesn't work
[03:17:00] <greek> it's not an issue, I can give the 1st tier of tr's a class
[03:17:09] <catamit3> veQue: yes :( but it took me 2h and not 5s, which is what it would take you
[03:17:10] <ianjm> i'm surprised .children doesn't work
[03:17:36] <greek> yeah that does it
[03:17:44] <ianjm> veQue: perhaps if you shoot randomly in to the air you'll catch a tall guy, freeing up his tall chair.
[03:17:47] <greek> ianjm it works but not with .each()
[03:17:58] <ianjm> i'm afraid i don't know why that is.
[03:18:02] <catamit3> I have a tall chair! but I had to trade my Aeron to get it :(
[03:18:04] <ianjm> i'm quite new to jquery myself
[03:18:16] <veQue> catamit3: lol no, it might've taken me 5 days
[03:18:22] <catamit3> net -$900 trade, i'm such a chair n00b
[03:18:23] <veQue> i'm newb
[03:18:42] <veQue> ianjm: hmmmm
[03:19:00] <ianjm> greek - don't suppose you have a dangling <tr> in the markup without a </tr> ?
[03:19:01] <ianjm> maybe?
[03:19:18] <veQue> catamit3: too bad you cant shrink yourself just as you sit on a chair
[03:19:19] <greek> ianjm, probably
[03:19:38] <veQue> they need to make more tall stuff
[03:19:44] <veQue> i see a lot of tall programmers
[03:19:45] <ianjm> it might be the reason jquery doesn't see the other <tr>'s as children....
[03:19:48] <ianjm> just a suggestion
[03:19:56] <ianjm> perhaps you could show us more of the code/markup
[03:20:11] <ianjm> although i'm afraid i don't really have time to look at this myself right now
[03:20:41] <ianjm> greek - have a read through http://api.jquery.com/children/
[03:20:51] <ianjm> i don't really know why .children() wouldn't be working in this situation
[03:20:52] <greek> ianjm, ok thanks again
[03:21:00] <ianjm> i assume you're just doing table.children("tr") ?
[03:21:45] <greek> yeah
[03:21:49] <ianjm> also, if you have intervening elements like <thead> or <tbody> you'd need to take these in to account
[03:21:52] <greek> table.children("tr").each(...)
[03:22:01] <ianjm> i.e. table.children("tbody").children("tr")
[03:22:51] <ianjm> i'd suggest double checking your markup.
[03:23:24] <ianjm> you could also try table.find("> * > tr");
[03:23:26] <ianjm> i don't think * is greedy
[03:25:59] <Cork> you can't do ">
[03:26:11] <Cork> it needs a parent
[03:27:56] <greek> I just stuck a class on my first tier of rows and used that in the find selector and it's working now
[03:28:15] <greek> for some reason my_table.children().each() returns all of them at once (as opposed to iterating)
[03:28:28] <greek> (i stuck an alert inside the each(...) function)
[03:28:39] <Cork> huh?
[03:28:47] <Cork> ah ya
[03:28:57] <Cork> children will return the closest child
[03:29:09] <Cork> while find looks through a selector
[03:29:41] <Cork> so you might need .children().eq(0).children()
[03:29:46] <ianjm> Cork: hmm really? sorry then. i thought it was ok to .find() with a selector like that if you already had an object, i must be mistaken...
[03:29:52] <Cork> it all depends on the structure
[03:29:52] <ianjm> yeah
[03:29:57] <ianjm> i'm a bit of a newb, apologies
[03:30:30] <Cork> ianjm: jquery runs parent.querySelectorAll()
[03:30:41] <Cork> and css doesn't allow the leading >
[03:30:57] <ianjm> gotcha.
[03:33:23] <david`> l
[03:50:26] <martisj> anybody know of any good dynamic layout plugins for jquery?
[04:00:11] <anew> if <script> tags are added with ajax, and you break on subtree modification, there should be a breakpoint set there shouldnt there?
[04:00:31] <websingh> hello all.
[04:12:58] <New0> hey everyone, i am trying to do select styling with jQuery-ui. https://github.com/fnagel/jquery-ui/wiki/Selectmenu but it's doesn't seems to work.

[04:27:03] <anew_> elrte
[04:27:51] <xec> New0: do you have a live url where it fails?
[04:28:16] <New0> xec what is live url?
[04:28:36] <New0> xec i am testing it in my local server
[04:29:00] <xec> an address where i can see what's happening - it's impossible to determine what's going on without seeing the issue first hand
[04:29:02] <New0> xec ho, i undertand what u mean. i will put it in JSFiddle
[04:29:36] <New0> xec there u go.. http://jsfiddle.net/ybqRB/
[04:30:10] <New0> xec, and i did check all in chrome, and all scripts and css files are loader
[04:30:13] <New0> *loaded
[04:30:59] <xec> New0: you need to include jquery core first, then the plugins
[04:31:13] <New0> yes, i did. as u see in the code
[04:31:19] <xec> oh wait looks like you got it twice
[04:31:39] <New0> where?
[04:31:42] <xec> you have <script src="http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.8.3.min.js"></script> after the plugins, which would overwrite the "old" jquery
[04:32:31] <New0> xec hooo mannn :) :) work work work tnx man
[04:32:59] <New0> xec "Most the the Debbuging issues are syntax, isn't?! :)"
[04:33:43] <New0> xec Thanks so much. working hours on this one. tnx for the fresh eyes :)
[04:35:42] <New0> xec, so (jusy my first time trying this kind of plugins) can i do this on select, ul.. etc??
[04:40:28] <NodeX> dont let it bubble up the dom looking for other elements
[04:45:31] <New0> xec do u know how can i center the text?
[04:50:17] <xec> NodeX: still holding a grudge, eh? :)
[04:50:46] <xec> New0: what text? in any case, #css is probably better for that sort of question
[04:50:47] <teegee543> hello, i'm using query 1.8.2 and am having trouble changing the value of a phone number field when submitting a form
[04:50:49] <teegee543> http://snipr.it/~s4#L_7
[04:51:13] <New0> xec, the text inside option
[04:51:57] <tomoyuki28jp> How can I run some script when window/tab is active?
[04:52:02] <xec> New0: depends on what your plugin does, i have no idea. styling on native select elements is quite limited (like, some browsers will let you center text, others not)
[04:53:09] <xec> New0: what i meant with "live" earlier is like a working testcase. i can't see whats going on on that jsfiddle link of yours because all the links are broken (local relative urls)
[04:53:13] <New0> xec, yes. Chrome, IE, and Safari having problem with it. and i think that there is an option in the plugin. whould u know?
[04:53:28] <xec> no, i don't know what the plugin does
[04:53:45] <New0> xec, ah tnx for the explaination.
[04:56:32] <aqeel> hi room

[05:27:20] <lekima_> or just locate the callee ? in chrome dev tool

[05:30:10] <New0> how can i center the text in select, option with jQuery-ui. selectmenu() plugin
[05:32:59] <ravenzz> lekima_ you should use breakpoints I guess
[05:33:19] <ravenzz> open the dev tools, go to theSOurces panel
[05:33:37] <ravenzz> locate the file/line and add a breakpoint
[05:44:07] <mazzachre> Hmmm... playing around with a scrollbar... How can I scroll some inner element to center a known position inside it's outer container?

[06:16:34] <aquatix> computer2000: something with ffmpeg?

[06:17:05] <aquatix> depending on your wishes, i'd go for a setup with ffmpeg
[06:18:18] <computer2000> aquatix: thx
[06:18:24] <hazamonzo> hey folks... im having issues with .animate and background:rgba().... i can animate from a solid colour to another but not using rgba.. is this a know issue with .animate() ?
[06:19:16] <hlve> hazamonzo, why not just use hex?
[06:22:32] <hazamonzo> hlve: i kinda wanted to use the alpha part. Can that be done with a simple background-color: #hexValue  ?
[06:25:30] <slax> I upgraded from jquery 1.4 to 1.8 and some code I have stopped working. Its not a lot so I was hoping someone would have time to taker a quick look and tell me what I need to change?
[06:26:27] <shoky> hazamonzo: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/
[06:26:41] <meanyface> slax: I'm game.
[06:27:07] <hazamonzo> shoky: Cool. So just to be sure. Its not possible out of the box? :)
[06:27:46] <shoky> hazamonzo: dont think so
[06:28:06] <hazamonzo> shoky: Okay cheers :)
[06:30:52] <seutje> death to plugins that have no mention of required jQuery version!
[06:40:43] <Flower_> Is it a good pluggin the jquery datatables?
[07:01:22] <slax> Could someone take a look at my jsfiddle and comapre it to the website and tell me why the jsfiddle is working but on the website its not?
[07:02:48] <fRAiLtY-> What's the correct syntax here:         jQuery('#matrix-container').empty().html('Loading price list...<br /><img src="<?php echo $this->getSkinUrl('images/loading.gif'); ?>" />');
[07:03:01] <fRAiLtY-> Getting issues with / being unexpected token
[07:03:27] <fRAiLtY-> Pretty sure the quotes are nested correctly though :x
[07:06:23] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: what's the output of the php
[07:07:28] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  I think I found the issue. That JS used to be inside a .phtml file in Magento, I've taken it out and put it in a separate JS file but now none of the php echo's etc work, is this normal?
[07:08:00] <fRAiLtY-> I set some var's at the top of the js, like var test = '<?php $_product->getId();?>' and they don't work :x
[07:08:04] <shoky> i dont know php man
[07:08:07] <shoky> this is #jquery
[07:08:26] <shoky> but stop putting php inside your JS
[07:08:34] <xec> fRAiLtY-: .js files won't be parsed by php (unless you excplicitly set it up to)
[07:08:50] <fRAiLtY-> Ah that would do it, I'll load it back inside the .phtml page then

[07:22:09] <HardDisk_WP> hey
[07:22:26] <jerware> this.el returns <select id="foo"></foo>  this.$el retgurn [<select id="foo"></foo>] yet calling append() on either errors in the console a --> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'append' of undefined
[07:22:40] <jerware> err,  <select id="foo"></foo>  this.$el retgurn [<select  id="foo"></foo>
[07:22:56] <jerware> err,  <select id="foo"></select>  // Typo sorry,
[07:23:23] <HardDisk_WP> can I select for all elements with class "gdl-left-sidebar" that have a child with class "page-item-14"?
[07:24:07] <Brodingo> ?has @ HardDisk_WP
[07:24:08] <bot-t> HardDisk_WP, .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[07:25:00] <HardDisk_WP> ok, can I do this also in CSS?
[07:25:12] <HardDisk_WP> need it both in CSS and javascript
[07:25:23] <HardDisk_WP> @brodingo
[07:25:44] <xec> you can add another classname after you have the jquery collection you want
[07:25:49] <Brodingo> umm parent selectors are css next
[07:25:49] <xec> but there is no .has() in css
[07:26:18] <BillCriswell> HardDisk_WP: There's no way to do that in CSS as far as I know.
[07:26:31] <jerware> this.el returns <select id="foo"></select>  this.$el retgurn [<select id="foo"></select>] yet calling append() on either errors in the console a --> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'append' of undefined
[07:26:41] <HardDisk_WP> ah damn... thank you
[07:26:53] <BillCriswell> jerware: You didn't include jQuery or either of them are jQuery objects.
[07:27:36] <BillCriswell> jerware: You probably want $(this.el)
[07:27:45] <jerware> ok
[07:28:01] <jmanso> hello
[07:28:16] <jmanso> I was wondering if anyone can provide me with some guidelines
[07:28:23] <Brodingo> ?jqf
[07:28:23] <bot-t> jQuery Fundamentals, a free online intro to jQuery - http://jqfundamentals.com
[07:28:36] <jmanso> in order to import a theme from theme roller into my site.master page
[07:40:09] <jerware> BillCriswell: well that got rid of the console error, but append() didn't work.
[07:40:10] <jerware> $(this.el).append($("<option></option>", {value: "foo", text: "foobar}))
[07:40:53] <jerware> $(this.el).append($("<option></option>").text("foo"));  // Nor this :(
[07:41:30] <Brodingo> jerware you only need the opening tag, just fyi
[07:41:48] <BillCriswell> jerware: The first example isn't a thing as far as I know? The second one I think would be ok, but do <option/> instead.
[07:42:11] <BillCriswell> If you want to set attributes use $el.attr('value', 'foo')
[07:42:30] <Brodingo> just <option> is fine if you just want an empty tag
[07:45:50] <BillCriswell> Brodingo: Oh, I thought you had to close it.
[07:46:22] <BillCriswell> :-/
[07:46:49] <wolfehr> hey guys, I'm sure I'm being stupid here, $foo.each('.bar', function(){  }) // Iterate through $foo elements (where foo is $(dom_obj)),
[07:47:24] <wolfehr> $('foo > .bar').each(function(){ }); //This is fine, but how can I do it with an object as the thing being iterated over
[07:47:38] <inad922> hello
[07:47:47] <Brodingo> ?jquery each
[07:47:47] <bot-t> jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[07:48:03] <shoky> wolfehr: $foo.find('> .bar').each
[07:48:16] <therealkoopa> Is there any magic for automatically scaling a div with scrollbars (width: 1000px and scollWidth: 3000px) and scaling everything inside so you can see the entire content within the div's 1000px width?
[07:48:26] <wolfehr> shaky, cheers that looks like what I'm after
[07:48:34] <wolfehr> or shoky rather
[07:48:42] <shoky> ;]
[07:51:00] <MalMen> there is any thing to make notifications on firefox and chrome ?
[07:51:04] <MalMen> (like msn)
[07:51:14] <inad922> Is there a way in jquery that I can grep for all tags that have a given attribute?
[07:51:58] <tra> made a simple image gallery with jquerytools overlay and trying to implement arrow-key navigation, but unable to get the eventhandler to trigger.
[07:52:23] <shoky> inad922: attribute selector. $('[bla]')
[07:52:24] <NoiseEee> inad922: $('[attributename]')
[07:52:35] <inad922> Thanks shoky, NoiseEee
[07:56:26] <jerware> BillCriswell: nope, still doesn't work.
[07:56:44] <BillCriswell> jerware: You'd need to set up an example somewhere.
[07:56:54] <hazamonzo> hmmm, why might this not work... http://jsfiddle.net/hzVVt/2/
[07:57:30] <Brodingo> animating color is jquery ui i believe
[07:57:39] <prilax> hello
[07:57:47] <BillCriswell> hazamonzo: Also, it would be "background-color" or "backgroundColor", not background-color
[07:58:01] <Brodingo> they both work
[07:58:04] <BillCriswell> Brodingo is right about animating colors, though!
[07:58:16] <Brodingo> oh
[07:58:18] <Brodingo> gotcha
[07:58:20] <BillCriswell> Brodingo: That's why I said or. =)
[07:58:24] <Brodingo> heh
[07:58:53] <hazamonzo> BillCriswell: I've tried a couple of different combinations but enev with background-color in quotes.. it still doesn't want to work on jsfiddle. Im missing something simple
[07:59:18] <Brodingo> hmm i thought there was an easy way to include ui in fiddle
[07:59:37] <Brodingo> hazamonzo you need jQuery UI
[07:59:48] <Brodingo> or the color plugin? is that still a thing?
[07:59:53] <hazamonzo> oooh, sorry i missed that
[07:59:57] <BillCriswell> hazamonzo: jQuery UI is what you'd need. http://jqueryui.com/animate/
[08:00:10] <hazamonzo> sorry! :)
[08:01:01] <mobile8> hi, i'm using gradients, and rounded corners for menu items, for some reason it's not possible to have both working together (I use PIE.js as border radius fix for IE7-8-9) on IE
[08:01:04] <mobile8> Any suggestions on how this can be solved?
[08:01:50] <Brodingo> ie9 has border radius no?
[08:02:51] <mobile8> it does sorry ie7-8 i mean
[08:03:03] <mobile8> but nonetheless it wont work together with css gradient transitions
[08:03:12] <mobile8> sorry let me rephrase
[08:04:07] <tra> any ideas why arrow key keypress is not triggered? every other key works, but nothing with arrow keys.
[08:06:02] <Brodingo> tra try using keyup/keydown
[08:06:46] <Brodingo> keypress is for character entered, keyup/down is for which key is pressed (wut)
[08:07:32] <aqeel> mobile8: it works
[08:07:41] <aqeel> i am using myself..
[08:07:47] <mobile8> aqeel: both? on ie 7-8 ?
[08:07:50] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[08:08:11] <aqeel> see it, still under construction for those ie though
[08:08:34] <mobile8> aqeel: ok, so that's rounded corners and gradients, correct?
[08:08:40] <aqeel> yes
[08:08:41] <mobile8> (what you wanted to demonstrate)
[08:08:44] <tra> Brodingo: yeah keyup did the trick
[08:09:02] <mobile8> aqeel: what about transitions, regarding gradients, any idea?
[08:09:10] <aqeel> it does work pie for rounded corners and gradients
[08:09:46] <mobile8> i couldn't get transitions from gradient to another gradient working
[08:09:54] <Brodingo> it doesnt work
[08:10:06] <Brodingo> you cant transition gradients (yet ? )
[08:10:15] <mobile8> should be
[08:10:35] <mobile8> i guess somewhere i'm making a mistake
[08:10:41] <Brodingo> well PIE uses wierd vector markup language i think
[08:10:47] <Brodingo> not sure how well that all fits together
[08:10:49] <aqeel> http://css3pie.com/documentation/known-issues/
[08:10:59] <aqeel> see what is conflicting
[08:11:01] <Brodingo> i would steer clear personally but eh
[08:11:21] <prilax> 5
[08:12:06] <aqeel> can you show meyour css
[08:12:15] <aqeel> i might help
[08:12:26] <Brodingo> is PIE js now or is it still htc....
[08:12:29] <aqeel> are you using htc or js
[08:12:30] <caino> hi there
[08:12:35] <aqeel> both
[08:12:58] <aqeel> http://css3pie.com/documentation/pie-js/
[08:13:58] <aqeel> mobile8: are you using js or htc
[08:14:13] <aqeel> prefer htc though if ask me
[08:15:25] <BLeg> Does the on() function post-1.7 work the same as the live() function pre-1.7?
[08:15:40] <aqeel> no and much better
[08:15:56] <BLeg> aqeel: Excellent. How is it better?
[08:15:59] <aqeel> purpose wise yes
[08:16:18] <aqeel> ?on()
[08:16:21] <bot-t> aqeel, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:16:26] <BLeg> I just want x, y and z to happen on a specific selector from now until the end of time
[08:16:31] <aqeel> ?live()
[08:16:31] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[08:16:46] <BLeg> aqeel: The keywords for me are "now and in the future."
[08:16:55] <mobile8> aqeel: htc
[08:16:56] <BLeg> This doesn't seem to hold true for on()
[08:17:02] <aqeel> on() is what you want ..live is deprecated
[08:17:11] <aqeel> it issssssssssss
[08:17:33] <BLeg> Yes it is deprecated... However, on() doesn't seem to be holding that "now and in the future." clause
[08:18:14] <Brodingo> it delegates events, so yes it does
[08:18:30] <BLeg> aqeel: That is: When new elements are added to the DOM that match the selector defined in the on() call, the events-map doesn' apply to them
[08:19:00] <Brodingo> you capture events at a higher level
[08:19:02] <aqeel> noooooooooooooo, existing and new added both
[08:19:29] <BLeg> Brodingo: I don't follow
[08:21:31] <BLeg> I just read "The handler is not called when the event occurs directly on the bound element, but only for descendants (inner elements) that match the selector". Is this the problem?
[08:21:58] <aqeel> BLeg: http://www.andismith.com/blog/2011/11/on-and-off/
[08:22:00] <NoiseEee> $('parentOfDynamicElements').on('click','.className',function(){});
[08:22:57] <aqeel> mobile8: is any or not at all pie is showing
[08:23:37] <BLeg> NoiseEee: Yeah I was afraid of that. What if I want to apply it only to specific elements within a parent though? For example: I have a parent div that contains two divs and two anchors. If I want the on() to apply only to the anchor tags, I'm just screwed? Or I have to hack something together?
[08:25:11] <NoiseEee> BLeg: that's what the selector is for.   $('parentOfDynamicElements').on('click','a',function(){});
[08:25:12] <aqeel> $('parentOfDynamicElements').on('click','.you want this, you want this too, and this, also this',function(){});
[08:26:45] <BLeg> NoiseEee Alright, that makes sense. I guess I just don;t understand the "why" to that. Thanks for the help.
[08:27:48] <mobile8> aqeel: gradient works cross browser, border radius doesn't
[08:28:09] <mobile8> when i remove gradient css styles, border radius works again cross browser
[08:28:29] <mobile8> aqeel:  behavior: url("js/PIE.htc");
[08:28:39] <mobile8> do you add it on every line using PIE?
[08:28:53] <aqeel> no ...
[08:28:58] <mobile8> how then
[08:29:55] <mobile8> Better would be to check what classes/ids etc use CSS3 features, and then add behavior to that right?
[08:29:59] <mobile8> (using jquery)
[08:30:09] <NoiseEee> BLeg: it's called event delegation, you can google about it
[08:30:37] <BLeg> NoiseEee: It's actually still not working, even with the selector in place
[08:31:17] <BLeg> Actually, a better question: Is AJAX exempt from on()?
[08:31:19] <NoiseEee> BLeg: recreate it 'not working' on a fiddle :)
[08:31:27] <NoiseEee> BLeg: uh, they're unrelated
[08:31:33] <nerk> any jquery.mobile developers here?
[08:32:07] <aqeel> no you can make another css and have commented for old ies
[08:32:15] <BLeg> NoiseEee: So when I'm adding elements to the DOM with an AJAX call, on() should still work on those elements?
[08:32:47] <NoiseEee> providing you've actually got the .on call on a parent of where those new elements are going, yes.
[08:32:53] <NoiseEee> *parent* not sibling etc etc
[08:32:57] <aqeel> bleg do you not read documents....what part are you not getting it.......on() is for existing and future dynamically created elements
[08:33:17] <nerk> jquery mobile issue -  If you configure your app to have "defaultPageTransition" to 'none', you don't get a loading indicator anymore and you get a blacking transition.  where the app goes black (or whatever bg color you have) for a second.  anyone know how to fix this?
[08:33:52] <nerk> setting defaultPageTransition to none does not take away jquery.mobile's ajax page loader.
[08:34:30] <BLeg> aqeel: Of course I read documentation. The part I'm not getting is the discrepancy in "What is documented" vs "What actually is". You can be as rude as you want all day, I'll just smile back at you until you go crazy. Keep at it.
[08:34:33] <aqeel> for border radius how are you specifying its css
[08:34:39] <nerk> meh.
[08:34:42] <mobile8> aqeel: ok, so you would just add a seperate line of that CSS stylerule for lt-ie9?
[08:35:04] <aqeel> yes
[08:35:08] <BLeg> NoiseEee: I'll try to create a fiddle that recreates the issue
[08:35:34] <aqeel> bleg i am not rude, it is you keep asking same question after and after again
[08:36:01] <BLeg> aqeel: I haven't gotten an answer that works
[08:36:11] <aqeel> then show us your case
[08:36:25] <aqeel> jsfiddle and let the brain washers do the washing for you
[08:36:54] <shoky> BLeg:  $(selector).live(type, function)  ===  $(document).on(type, selector, function)
[08:37:02] <user_corrupt> Im a beginner with JavaScript/jQuery, and I'm having trouble using a certain plugin with WordPress...usually when I implement a jQuery plugin into a WordPress theme then I have to change all instances of "$" to "jQuery" and then the plugin will stop conflicting with WordPress's built-in jQuery...well, I tried that with this jQuery "scroll follow" plugin and it breaks the plugin without throwing any error codes....does anyone have an

[08:37:50] <aqeel> is it working now?
[08:38:16] <itatitat> guys I'm passing an array of objects to a function, and later, making console.log over this array of objects, they an array of text in firebug, not an object
[08:38:19] <itatitat> what happen?
[08:38:46] <shoky> ?demo @ itatitat
[08:38:46] <bot-t> itatitat, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:38:56] <NoiseEee> itatitat: channel crystal ball is malfunctioning :(
[08:39:21] <eugenmayer> Hello, Anyboady knows about some simple jquery based "doodle like" library? googled quiet for some time know, but no hits. Maybe someone has a hint? Thanks!
[08:39:50] <BillCriswell> <!--[if lte IE 6]><table><tr><td><![endif]--> Fuck.
[08:40:07] <aqeel> lol
[08:41:45] <itatitat>  here is my problem , thanks! http://jsfiddle.net/5Z8F2/
[08:42:01] <aqeel> BLeg: where is your cae file
[08:42:05] <aqeel> case*
[08:42:26] <BLeg> NoiseEee: Your example worked as expected. I'm trying to recreate what I have (It's almost identical, save the AJAX functionality) and it isn't doing anything.
[08:42:34] <NoiseEee> itatitat: its because you're console.logging an object along with a string
[08:42:34] <NoiseEee> itatitat: two separate console calls.
[08:42:38] <shoky> itatitat: that's just the string representation of your array. because you are concatenating it to another string
[08:42:49] <BLeg> aqeel: We're done. Continue as per normal.
[08:42:49] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ BLeg
[08:42:53] <itatitat> oh no...........kill me
[08:43:15] <aqeel> so it works @ bleg
[08:43:25] <shoky> use a comma instead of a plus, in the console.log
[08:43:30] <shoky> console.log(a,b,c)
[08:43:34] <shoky> not a+b+c
[08:44:15] <nerk> BillCriswell: ick.
[08:45:48] <BillCriswell> nerk: HAha. This dude basically did that for a whole site.
[08:46:28] <peterschmidler> Is there a shorter way for this? $(window).scrollLeft($(window).scrollLeft() - delta * 30)
[08:47:09] <aqeel> i am afraid no as it calculates mathematics
[08:49:49] <peterschmidler> Whats the difference in using bind vs. using the event helper in here? https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel
[08:50:29] <nerk> BillCriswell: that makes sad pandas cry
[08:50:36] <shoky> peterschmidler: no difference
[08:50:55] <peterschmidler> shoky: What's the pros/cons for them?
[08:51:05] <nerk> hey, what are the benefits to having your jquery mobile site ajax enabled?  Is it these items: 1) Page Transition effects, 2) One time load of js libs?
[08:51:06] <BillCriswell> nerk: It used to make me sad. Eventually sadness just becomes "ok".
[08:51:10] <iSeeDeadPixels> can i use the google maps API with jQuery? :)
[08:51:34] <BillCriswell> iSeeDeadPixels: It's all Java Script, so sure!
[08:51:36] <shoky> peterschmidler: no pros/cons for either, exactly the same effect.  but using the general 'mousewheel' event name, you can do other things than .bind such as .delegate or .on
[08:51:39] <BillCriswell> JavaScript*
[08:52:12] <nerk> since the animation sucks.. I have tried defaultPageTransition set to 'none'.  The result? blacking transitions.. it's terrible really.  So now I am going to try with ajaxEnabled set to false.
[08:52:14] <shoky> peterschmidler: they did it like that to mimic how it is for normal jquery events like there's  .click(..) which is shorthand for .bind('click',
[08:52:19] <iSeeDeadPixels> BillCriswell: any way to retrieve JSON from a webpage, post data to the geocoder API, and finally add the markers to the map? :)
[08:52:23] <BillCriswell> I turned off join/exit notifications in the window. This is so much nicer.
[08:52:31] <iSeeDeadPixels> also, i am usinga touchscreen pc, how can i handle dragging events?
[08:52:50] <m41is> hi, do everyone know an plugin to style a selectbox which i can use for free for a  commercial project?
[08:52:52] <peterschmidler> shoky: So the shorter version is to be preferred and more flexible?
[08:53:17] <shoky> peterschmidler: its really a matter of personal preference
[08:53:30] <peterschmidler> shoky: THanks
[08:53:50] <aqeel> m41is: http://www.jquery4u.com/plugins/10-jquery-selectboxdrop-down-plugins/
[08:53:54] <BillCriswell> iSeeDeadPixels: You can use $.getJSON() and handle it that way.
[08:54:09] <iSeeDeadPixels> okay =] and for the touchscreen events? :)
[08:54:19] <BillCriswell> I don't have much experience with the drag events, though.
[08:54:22] <aqeel> m41is: http://adam.co/lab/jquery/customselect/
[08:54:57] <iSeeDeadPixels> mehh
[08:55:00] <rahmen> Hi! I have this code: http://pastebin.com/rXECAqNC I need both this and the event.target in the function so that's why I use $.proxy. Inside the element with .some-class I have other elements like a span for example. If I click the span the event.target will be the span and not the element with .some-class. How should I avoid this?
[08:55:10] <user_corrupt> freeed: http://pastebin.com/P2B784xp
[08:55:11] <iSeeDeadPixels> i have this div, i now open and close it by tapping it
[08:55:22] <iSeeDeadPixels> i want to be able to "slide" it open
[08:55:42] <nerk> fuck me
[08:55:57] * iSeeDeadPixels fucks nerk
[08:55:58] <nerk> I need to go backwards now and try another mobile UI
[08:56:07] <nerk> the transitions in jquery.mobile are horrid
[08:56:20] <iSeeDeadPixels> phonegap?
[08:56:36] <freeed> Hey user_corrupt, like so: http://pastebin.com/hRLTTsLg
[08:56:40] <nerk> and there is no threads discussing how to smooth them out.. disabling ajax makes it worse.. setting the pagetransition to none makes it black the transition.
[08:56:45] <nerk> iSeeDeadPixels: yes
[08:56:49] <m41is> aquell: i know them but im not sure that i can use them in an commercial project
[08:57:21] <aqeel> nerk: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10903433/ios5-jquery-mobile-transition-blinks
[08:57:29] <shoky> rahmen: tried event.currentTarget ?
[08:58:14] <MistuhKurtz> iSeeDeadPixels, just bind a touch move event along with your click event. There are several touch event libraries you can use
[08:58:24] <aqeel> m41is: you can always read their licensce http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
[08:58:25] <evilgeenius> Does anyone know why this expression works in Jquery 1.4.2 but not Jquery 1.8.2 ? : input.text[data-barcode="68"][data-index>01]
[08:58:38] <shoky> >01 ?
[08:58:39] <evilgeenius> I meant :  : input.text[data-barcode="68"][data-index>1]
[08:59:09] <aqeel> 1.8.2 is huge shift lots of things will break
[08:59:10] <shoky> selectors cant do inequality comparisons..
[08:59:11] <ryanneufeld> evilgeenius: because sizzle (the selector engine) was rewritten
[08:59:19] <shoky> oOo
[08:59:23] <shoky> what did >1 do
[08:59:29] <nerk> aqeel: thanks.. I will try those css tricks
[08:59:34] <user_corrupt> freeed: TypeError: $ is undefined
[08:59:40] <user_corrupt> :(
[08:59:50] <evilgeenius> ryanneufeld: ok thanks.  Is there an equivalent way to do that now?
[08:59:53] <aqeel> you are welcome
[09:00:11] <freeed> user_corrupt, what is the line/file for the error? Guessing it's coming from scrollFollow and not your script
[09:00:19] <ryanneufeld> evilgeenius: you would need to use ?each
[09:00:19] <bot-t> evilgeenius, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:01:10] <evilgeenius> ryanneufeld: So there isn't a selector that will "select" only the matching elements?
[09:01:14] <user_corrupt> freeed: http://pastebin.com/xfPvRtTw
[09:01:14] <shoky> and then there's ?filter
[09:01:59] <aqeel> evilgeenius: http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[09:02:19] <freeed> user_corrupt, yeah it's the scrollFollow plugin causing that, becuase it needs that same wrapping instead of .read() - just like http://pastebin.com/hRLTTsLg
[09:03:10] <ryanneufeld> evilgeenius: if there is you'll find it here ?selectors
[09:03:21] <ryanneufeld> ?selectors @evilgeenius
[09:03:22] <bot-t> evilgeenius, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[09:03:32] <evilgeenius> ryanneufeld: thanks a lot
[09:04:01] <ryanneufeld> evilgeenius: you might also want to see ?map
[09:04:01] <bot-t> evilgeenius, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[09:04:05] <ryanneufeld> evilgeenius: and see ?filter
[09:04:05] <bot-t> evilgeenius, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[09:04:06] <goddard> my .click function isn't working and i get no error any idea what is wrong?
[09:04:08] <BLeg> NoiseEee: I don't know if you're still here but this is the difference in my code: http://jsfiddle.net/jvgPN/3/
[09:04:34] <BLeg> NoiseEee: And that comes because it's using AJAX
[09:04:42] <shoky> goddard: try harder
[09:04:56] <goddard> shoky: genius
[09:05:42] <shoky> try harder at asking your question.
[09:05:42] <shoky> why not just write 'hi , i get error, whats wrong?!'
[09:05:42] <nerk> here we go.. crossing fingers.
[09:05:42] <NoiseEee> BLeg: once you remove the element that originally had the .on (and why would you??!) of course it will not longer work
[09:06:03] <NoiseEee> BLeg: find a *higher* parent, in your case, "outer"
[09:06:08] <goddard> shoky: did you even read what i said ... I said i get no error
[09:06:11] <therealkoopa> Is it possible to zoom or scale a div that has scrollbars (large scrollWidth/scrollHeight) so everything is visible within the div without the scrollbars?
[09:06:15] <NoiseEee> BLeg: so in your case, you put the .on on the div id oute
[09:06:20] <shoky> ?demo @ goddard
[09:06:20] <bot-t> goddard, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:06:20] <BLeg> NoiseEee: Because it's being created with AJAX. It's not up to me whether or not the element is still there. I just assumed "Now and in the future" meant "Now and in the future"
[09:06:31] <NoiseEee> BLeg: then put your .on() on #outer
[09:06:37] <shoky> goddard: did YOU even read what you said? its impossible to know anything from you saying "it doesnt work"
[09:06:45] <halcyon1234> jqm: I'm trying to .clone a group of radio buttons, but after .clone, all clicks end up going to the original radio button group: http://jsbin.com/agahuj/1
[09:06:52] <BLeg> NoiseEee: I put #outer in there because I didn't have anywhere to actually append it in the fiddle. It doesn't exist in the actual code
[09:07:23] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/jvgPN/4/ @ BLeg
[09:07:51] <BLeg> goddard: Welcome to IRC chat. Hope youre wearing a cup. The slightest stray or remote inconsistency or minute unclarity in question only generates a barrage of flame. Be ready.
[09:07:55] <NoiseEee> BLeg: surely there is some other parent you can observe with .on(), even body if need be (but you'll want to adjust your selector in that case)
[09:08:02] <goddard> shoky: yes that is obviously true and appreciate you point that out my good friend BUT what do you do when you get no errors and something that should work doesn't
[09:08:17] <goddard> BLeg: haha
[09:08:29] <shoky> goddard: reproduce the issue on a jsfiddle or give us a live link to see the problem, or AT LEAST show some code.
[09:08:39] <goddard> it works fine in jsfiddle
[09:08:47] <cusco> hi... if I'm using .ajax() to send data, nI have data: $(document.getElementById('send')).serialize()
[09:08:48] <shoky> goddard: when i do .click() it works fine.
[09:08:51] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ goddard
[09:08:57] <shoky> goddard: so you must be wrong, right?
[09:08:58] <BLeg> goddard: No but on the serious, you've been warned lol.
[09:09:08] <cusco> so far so good, but now I want to add more data
[09:09:08] <nerk> well, that stackoverflow made it worse
[09:09:10] <nerk> lol
[09:09:41] <BLeg> NoiseEee: I can maybe bubble it up, in this case my selector will still change.
[09:09:56] <user_corrupt> freeed: Im looking really hard at the wrapper that you showed me, trying to compare it to everything, but i just dont know how to add it to the script in question: http://pastebin.com/VB3AZ6wt
[09:10:20] <goddard> shoky: don't believe i am.. i think there might be some conflict between different js frameworks
[09:10:26] <goddard> but it should give an error rigth?
[09:10:28] <aqeel> nerk: lol
[09:10:29] <aqeel> really
[09:10:42] <shoky> goddard: if you used it wrong, it doesnt have to give an error..
[09:10:44] <Kambfhase> cusco: try +
[09:10:45] <NoiseEee> goddard: the first problem is using more than one js lib
[09:10:51] <goddard> i can do alert on load using jquery selectors for that and it works fine
[09:10:51] <nerk> might have done something wrong.. checking it out further
[09:10:59] <shoky> goddard: for example if you did the click event on the wrong element..
[09:11:02] <goddard> shoky: if it works in js fiddle how could it be wrong
[09:11:17] <shoky> goddard:  something is wrong..
[09:11:23] <goddard> shoky: ive tried three different classes which are preceded by a period
[09:11:32] <shoky> goddard: this will get you nowhere.
[09:11:37] <shoky> goddard: show some code.
[09:11:56] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ goddard
[09:12:59] <halcyon1234> Any ideas on how I'm screwing up the .clone to make the radios go wonky?  http://jsbin.com/agahuj/1
[09:13:29] <freeed> user_corrupt, it's actually partly there, see the very last line? })( $ );  NO IDEA why that author would do that, it's suppose to be })(jQuery);  try to change it and see if that helps.
[09:13:36] <shoky> goddard: and notice you havent even said one word about what the actual problem is. except "it doesnt work"
[09:15:00] <goddard> shoky: haha figured it out
[09:15:21] <shoky> yerp
[09:15:27] <aqeel> halcyon1234: you are using same id
[09:15:55] <user_corrupt> freeed: seems to have helped, now there is just the same error with ui.core.js I'll try and fix that now, thank you very much for you help
[09:16:01] <Drager> Is it possible redirect a user to a url?
[09:16:05] <Drager> When pressing a button?
[09:16:15] <shoky> ..
[09:16:23] <nerk> meh
[09:16:26] <shoky> Drager: yep
[09:16:37] <freeed> user_corrupt, no problem! You might write that plugin author and ask him to incorporate that change, or if it's on github toss him a pull request with that change
[09:16:47] <halcyon1234> aqeel: After cloning, I iterate through the radios and adjust the id to id_clone. Same with the "for" attribute on the labels.  The clone ids show ok in Firebug.
[09:17:07] <aqeel> let me see furtherr
[09:17:52] <Drager> shoky: So I have a .click function then I insert something into a textfield when pressing an icon. Now I want the user to get redirected to that div. I have done this; var url = $(location).attr('href') + "#reply";
[09:18:17] <shoky> redirected to that div..?
[09:18:23] <shoky> oh
[09:18:28] <shoky> mm..
[09:18:39] <Drager> If you know what I mean ;)
[09:18:40] <shoky> $(location).attr('href')  is baaad
[09:19:16] <rahmen> shoky: Nice, thanks!
[09:19:35] <Drager> shoky: Okey, is there a better way?
[09:19:51] <shoky> Drager: not sure what you want.. you want to scroll the window to a div?
[09:19:59] <Drager> shoky: Yeah
[09:20:01] <Drager> Correct
[09:20:04] <shoky> so.. no redirect?
[09:20:09] <NoiseEee> http://balupton.github.com/jquery-scrollto/demo/ @ Drager
[09:20:56] <shoky> Drager: and btw,  location.href  instead of $(location).attr('href')
[09:21:29] <shoky> (not that you need it with the scrollto plugin)
[09:21:49] <Drager> Do I really need a third-party plugin for this?
[09:22:25] <shoky> location.hash = '#reply'
[09:22:26] <shoky> maybe..
[09:23:12] <Drager> shoky: that worked
[09:23:20] <shoky> cool
[09:23:38] <Drager> shoky: THanks :)
[09:26:46] <MistuhKurtz> drag
[09:26:55] <MistuhKurtz> Drager, make a jsfiddle and I will help you.
[09:28:30] <Drager> MistuhKurtz: It works fine now :)
[09:28:37] <Drager> Thanks anyway
[09:28:40] <MistuhKurtz> well you can animate the scroll if you like?
[09:29:40] <Drager> MistuhKurtz: I guess not but I just want to get down the the form.
[09:31:42] <MistuhKurtz> Drager, var top = $(el).offset(); $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: top});
[09:33:28] <halcyon1234> aqeel:  Seems to work if I give the template "data-role='none'", then strip that data-role on the clones, and finally manually initilize the clones using .checkboxradio().  Feels a bit hacky, but it works. :|
[09:35:12] <Drager> MistuhKurtz: Will try that. Thanks
[09:37:44] <kracekumar_> how can i capture cut, copy, paste event in .on()
[09:40:16] <BillCriswell> kracekumar_: You can find out if they were pretty control c or control v, but you won't have access to the clipboard or anything.
[09:42:09] <kracekumar_> BillCriswell, thats ok, I want to figure out similar to 'click' is there any event available or capture keydown event and look for keycode
[09:43:09] <MistuhKurtz> kracekumar_, $(document).on('keypress', function(event){ console.log(event.which); });
[09:47:19] <BillCriswell> kracekumar_: You in Chrome?
[09:47:25] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/umakic/1/edit if you look at the console here you can see it in action.
[09:47:49] <kracekumar_> BillCriswell, I use firefox nightly, does chome detect it ?
[09:48:25] <BillCriswell> kracekumar_: I was just making sure you have some kind of console.
[09:49:01] <kracekumar_> BillCriswell, :-)
[09:50:37] <BillCriswell> ken-ignite: http://www.mkyong.com/jquery/how-to-detect-copy-paste-and-cut-behavior-with-jquery/ also seems helpful.
[09:51:56] <kracekumar_> I tried bind event It din work
[09:52:06] <kracekumar_> Now  should check why, I like jsbin, its super cool.
[09:53:41] <BillCriswell> I had no idea "copy", "paste" and "cut" were events in older jQuery?
[09:54:04] <BillCriswell> kracekumar_: Might only be older verisons of jQuery that support it..
[09:54:42] <kracekumar_> ok, BillCriswell I am on 1.8.3, if bind doesn't work, I will fall back to event.which
[09:55:05] <BillCriswell> kracekumar_: Might just want .on('event1 event2', ...) etc
[09:55:13] <dblosevn> BillCriswell: I would agree, it was quite a while ago that the browsers stopped giving you access to the clipboard thats probally when the events were removed
[09:56:31] <kracekumar_> yes BillCriswell, .on('keyPress') { if e.which == 88 .. }
[09:56:38] <BillCriswell> Disable copy and paste scripts are hilarious.
[09:57:02] <dblosevn> BillCriswell: I know such a waste of time... simply disable js and do your thing
[09:58:04] <dblosevn> BillCriswell: or set a breakpoint in the function and return from the console before it does its thing if you need js
[09:58:38] <BillCriswell> dblosevn: YEah, if someone wants something bad enough and it's on your screen... you can get it.
[09:59:01] <dblosevn> Worst case go to your cache directory and just copy it out
[09:59:52] <BillCriswell> dblosevn: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/cutcopypaste.html damn, looking a lot like Christmas.
[10:00:30] <dblosevn> Kills me how much time people spend on making copy paste protection scripts when it generally takes less then 30 seconds to defat them lmao
[10:00:40] <dblosevn> Defeat
[10:02:35] <dblosevn> Ya but dont you have to enable some super hidden config variable to make that work in firefox and chrome?
[10:03:00] <cambazz> ok, i need to execute some code right after user plugins the credit card number. i need to check bin numbers and see if i can do installments.
[10:03:05] <cambazz> i am also using keypad plugin
[10:03:24] <cambazz> how can i execute some code right after user focuses out from a jq validated input box?
[10:03:37] <dblosevn> .blur
[10:03:51] <dblosevn> @cambazz
[10:04:16] <BillCriswell> $('.cc').on('blur', function(){ ... Check it .... });
[10:06:51] <guide_X> is there a way to rename the jquery library, or use two jquery libraries side by side? for instance, I have a drupal 7 site, I wish to use jquery v1.8 with it, but I cannot.. Is there a way to rename jquery so my v1.8 based pluggin will use that renamed jquery instead?
[10:07:24] <veQue> dblosevn: exactly
[10:07:26] <wroathe> guid_X
[10:07:35] <wroathe> Use an anonymous function
[10:07:37] <veQue> there's no copy and paste protection i cant get around
[10:07:52] <veQue> even if it comes to takeing a picture with a camera
[10:08:07] <wroathe> (function (jQ1, jQ2) {}(jQuery, otherJQuery));
[10:08:24] <guide_X> hmm I will google it
[10:08:26] <guide_X> the anonymous function thing, thanks
[10:08:28] <BillCriswell> guide_X: Also, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[10:08:48] <vacho> guys, I want to get the SQL data as shown in the image..can someone help me how to get it? http://screencast.com/t/RTbWY1PrbMPm I have a break point at line 88 as you can see
[10:09:52] <dblosevn> vacho: could you have possibly shown us less code? geesh
[10:10:20] <vacho> dblosevn: what do you mean sir?
[10:10:39] <dblosevn> vacho: for one what plugin are you using
[10:10:45] <Kambfhase> thats base64
[10:10:49] <guide_X> so something like this will work for me? blog.nemikor.com/2009/10/03/using-multiple-versions-of-jquery/
[10:10:50] <dblosevn> is that ui or some custom dataTable
[10:11:05] <vacho> jquery datatable, I want it in base64
[10:11:54] <guide_X> but will it interfear with "drupals" version of jquery?
[10:12:14] <dblosevn> vacho: from datatables.net?
[10:12:41] <vacho> dblosevn: correct.
[10:14:19] <brend_> gosh. need vacations
[10:18:51] <dblosevn> brend_: grab me a beeer before you go
[10:19:11] <Heather_> I usually use js to change content on my page but I want to change the url that is displayed aswell e.g domain.com/?id=1 to domain.com/?id=2 how can I do this?
[10:19:30] <brend_> dblosevn: have u tried corona with lemon inside?
[10:20:33] <MistuhKurtz> Heather_, the jQuery BBQ plugin is great for handling tha ttype of stuff
[10:20:40] <dblosevn> brend_: nasty nasty nasty ill only do that if im already drunk enough not to care and there out of lime
[10:20:54] <brend_> lol
[10:21:49] <brend_> its too latin
[10:23:39] <dblosevn> vacho: I cant find anything in the api reference for fnInitComplete I would assume the data you want is in the json arg, I would add a watch to that and see whats inside
[10:24:10] <vacho> dblosevn: that worked sir thank u!
[10:26:18] <brend_> dblosevn:  you got good skills in php?
[10:26:42] <dblosevn> brend_: I got skillz with everything just ask tha ladiez
[10:26:51] <brend_> haha
[10:27:12] <brend_> u are the man
[10:27:25] <dblosevn> wow thats exactly what they say
[10:27:29] <monkey> I did ask the ladies, and they said your tests didn't green-bar.
[10:27:57] <dblosevn> thats a good thing when the test green bar you may need a trip to the health department
[10:28:32] <monkey> Heheh apologies for lurking, but I can't help but think your nick means 'diabloseven'.
[10:29:11] <dblosevn> dbl (double) O (0) sevn (seven) double o seven or 007
[10:29:16] <monkey> Oh I know.
[10:29:50] <monkey> What'd you think of Skyfall?  (or is that for #moviereviews?)
[10:29:56] <dblosevn> they call me diablo on xbox live all the time im like wtf where is the `a` they are seeing
[10:30:50] <brend_> they call me messi in pes2013
[10:34:41] <brend_> 5 hours with the same query
[10:35:59] <Wolf_22> I have a textarea inside a div. The textarea has a higher height value than the div that contains it, so the textarea is cut-off. Unfortunately, it has to be this way due to the UI / business requirements, however, I'm thinking that when a user hovers or sets focus on the textarea that there should be a way to somehow change the positioning and z-index value of the textarea to make the...
[10:36:01] <Wolf_22> ...textarea temporary "bust out and above" its container so that the user can see the whole element... Is there a way to leverage this while maintaining source flow of the element to avoid it losing where it is on the page (from being set to position absolute during hover / focus?)
[10:36:16] <goddard> i have a .hover event trigger but if there a way to trigger when the hover even stops?
[10:39:12] <coderhut> goddard: onmouseout might be what you want
[10:41:42] <goddard> coderhut: thanks i figured out the .hover function can take 2 functions as parameters
[10:41:54] <goddard> the second being the mouse out trigger
[10:42:05] <coderhut> cool
[10:47:17] <coderhut> Wolf_22: why dont you decrease the height of text area so that it touches the top boundry of div and you wont need jquery?
[10:48:30] <coderhut> or increase the padding-top
[10:52:20] <kracekumar_> for detecting right click paste, which event should I listen, I tried with mouseenter, mouse leave
[10:52:29] <kracekumar_> no hope
[10:53:05] <Wolf_22> coderhut: This textarea (and many other form elements) are all inline with each other whereby this entire "row" of controls acts as a means of data entry for the Excel-like page I've created. Each row maintains a static height... So to bypass this aesthetic / UI / textarea usage restriction, I thought that using a hover / focus on the textarea somehow would remedy this... (Each row is...
[10:53:07] <Wolf_22> ..."dragged" into the main content page, so dragging a row of data that has a max height of whatever the textarea grows to wouldn't really work well in this case.)
[10:58:46] <jacoluta> kracekumar_: mousedown
[10:59:09] <halcyon1234> kracekumar_: If you're tring to prevent a paste into a field, no there is no hope, and you should stop trying. If you're just looking for when new data enters a field, you should try .change()
[10:59:26] <coderhut> Wolf_22: then you might also need the function .hover() of jquery and to see if textarea is being hovered over or not use the trick explained by Ali in comments on this page http://api.jquery.com/hover/ .
[10:59:47] <kracekumar_> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/mouse-events/ i am looking one by one
[11:00:38] <kracekumar_> halcyon1234, My use case is if user pastes content in text field activate button, figured for ctrl + v but looking for mouse event, right click + paste
[11:01:11] <jacoluta> http://jsfiddle.net/Gt2cn/
[11:01:19] <jacoluta> well that will get u started with a right click
[11:01:38] <Wolf_22> coderhut: Yep, that's right--the only issue I'm having with that is how the positioning works... In order to show the textarea over its container DIV, I have to set it to absolute positioning and then apply z-index to layer it above said container... But when I do this, it loses placement with the markup (i.e. - page flow of other elements, etc.) Is there a way to make something position:absolute
[11:01:39] <Wolf_22> but still maintain position within the markup stack so that aesthetics aren't compromised?
[11:01:59] <Wolf_22> coderhut: But I'll check that link out to see if it helps.
[11:02:16] <BD--> shoky: remember my problem from yesterday evening, with the resize handles not showing up (height 0) ? I set up  a very simple live example with practically nothing more than the jsfiddle example: http://fotogiesels.be/test.php
[11:02:24] <BD--> here's the working js fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/XedDB/5/
[11:02:48] <kracekumar_> jacoluta, I am using .on event, $('#speaker_name').on('keydown', 'mousedown', function(event){});
[11:05:42] <coderhut> Wolf_22: sorry regarding css i dont have expertize.. you might need to have css expert sit beside you and then try jquery tricks with it. or rewrite your issue and gurus sitting here might help you better.
[11:06:03] <Wolf_22> coderhut: Sounds like a plan. Thanks!
[11:08:11] <JFranks> I'm looking for any easy (already worked out) ways to attach a 'go'/'search' button to an input element just like the 'buttonset' option does for button() elements?
[11:08:41] <JFranks> Heck.. letting me include an input in a buttonset would be just perfect
[11:09:35] <jacoluta> well use bind
[11:09:41] <jacoluta> kracekumar_: ^
[11:10:34] <w00tner> can anyone help me with this thing,. it loops forever http://pastie.org/5512468
[11:11:01] <kracekumar_> jacoluta, .on('mousedown keydown') isn't good enough ?
[11:11:21] <w00tner> actualy it loops 10 times...
[11:11:28] <jacoluta> yea
[11:12:38] <jacoluta> so you want to activate a button when a field is not empty>
[11:12:55] <kracekumar_> on attaches everytime DOM chnaged. Somewhere read that is good approach
[11:13:36] <kracekumar_> jacoluta, exactly and deactivate when text field is empty
[11:13:38] <katsh_> can $.get be delegated?
[11:13:54] <jacoluta> well yea u can just use .change()
[11:15:00] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: $('field-selector').change(function() { if (this.value == '') { $('button-selector').prop('disabled', true); }else{$('button-selector').prop('disabled', false)}
[11:15:52] <kracekumar_> dblosevn, seems much easier than look for keydown and mousedown
[11:16:09] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: I would think so...
[11:16:14] <kracekumar_> jacoluta, ^
[11:16:27] <kracekumar_> let me code & check
[11:17:06] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: $('field-selector').on('keydown, mousedown, change', function() { if (this.value == '') { $('button-selector').prop('disabled', true); }else{$('button-selector').prop('disabled', false)}
[11:17:10] <dblosevn> could do that too
[11:17:17] <dblosevn> without the , s
[11:17:20] <dblosevn> oops lol
[11:17:36] <dblosevn> 'keydown mousedown change'
[11:17:50] <dblosevn> change isnt fired until blur in most cases
[11:18:04] <jerware> I want to verify if an object is in a list based on 1 of it's data members and not all members.
[11:18:26] <jerware> Because I only care about that one member
[11:18:35] <ccm84> anyone have a prefereance on a jquery inline editor? needs to handle multiple instances, input and textareas
[11:18:37] <jerware> 's/member/attribute/'
[11:18:46] <ccm84> also upload via ajax automatically
[11:18:49] <ccm84> ppost
[11:19:43] <jacoluta> jerware: elaborate ?
[11:21:27] <dblosevn> ccm84: I usually use extjs for that with the jquery adapter there grids are just made for that
[11:21:59] <ccm84> thanks dblosevn, but I am not looking a grid tyep setup.  really using it in a backend to just edit text elements around without loading another page
[11:22:46] <dblosevn> ccm84: in that case yes i have used jquery.editable for that in the past
[11:23:25] <dblosevn> ccm84: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable
[11:24:24] <ccm84> k, was looking at alternatives.  jeditable has been giving me an issue with not uploading on a textarea, not sure why.  maybe ill just snap something together
[11:25:07] <dblosevn> ccm84: possibly the selector for textarea is not included in the list of elements to bind to in jeditable did into the code and see
[11:25:24] <dblosevn> *dig into
[11:25:29] <ccm84> it pulls up the edit box
[11:25:33] <ccm84> and all of hte regular inputs work
[11:25:43] <ccm84> but on blur, it doesn't process anything for some reason
[11:25:46] <ccm84> just leaves it as a textbox
[11:25:49] <ccm84> textarea*
[11:26:13] <jerware> jacoluta: I have an array of objects, I want to verify if there exists an object in that array based on a particular member
[11:26:23] <dblosevn> ^^ what i just said dig into the code and verify that textarea is on the selector list jeditable binds to
[11:26:42] <jerware> [{name: "foo", other: "w/e"}] in this case based on name
[11:27:45] <dblosevn> ccm84: the latest version seems too.. http://www.appelsiini.net/download/jquery.jeditable.js
[11:28:09] <shoky> ?$.grep @ jerware
[11:28:10] <bot-t> jerware, jQuery.grep() - Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[11:29:13] <shoky> jerware: forexample  $.grep(array, function(obj) { return obj.name == 'foo' })
[11:29:35] <jacoluta> ^
[11:29:57] <jerware> doesn't grep remove elements from the array ?
[11:30:04] <shoky> it filters the array.
[11:30:19] <shoky> that example will keep only the objects whose name == 'foo'
[11:30:21] <jerware> I don't want to alter the original array
[11:30:25] <shoky> you won't
[11:30:31] <shoky> var newarray = $.grep(array, ...)
[11:30:36] <jerware> thanks.
[11:31:25] <kracekumar_> jacoluta, dblosevn no it doesn't work http://jsbin.com/welcome/60461/edit
[11:31:28] <BD--> can anyone tell me why my resizable handles are invisible (0 height) in this resizable are ? -> http://fotogiesels.be/test.php
[11:31:46] <shoky> BD-- i had an answer for yo uyesterday but you left
[11:31:57] <BD--> really =oo
[11:32:06] <shoky> yea lemme try to remember ;p
[11:32:07] <shoky> oh
[11:32:09] <BD--> =D
[11:32:12] <shoky> you didnt include jquery ui CSS
[11:32:16] <shoky> you only included the .JS
[11:32:18] <shoky> if i recall
[11:32:19] <BD--> oh boy
[11:32:30] <BD--> :')))
[11:32:35] <shoky> yepp
[11:32:47] <BD--> i'm quite lol'ing at myself now :p
[11:32:51] <BD--> thanks :')
[11:32:52] <shoky> ;]
[11:33:35] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: it works great but as I mentioned before change is only fired after blur in most cases
[11:34:05] <kracekumar_> yes, dblosevn any fix available ?
[11:35:07] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: I posted the fix earlier... $('#speaker-name').on('change click keydown', function() {
[11:35:25] <jacoluta> kracekumar_: just fire it
[11:35:27] <dblosevn> really change is overkilled
[11:35:34] <dblosevn> just click keydown
[11:36:13] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: http://jsbin.com/welcome/60468/edit
[11:36:49] <ogk1000> shoky, hello sir !
[11:37:07] <shoky> hy dood
[11:37:18] <ogk1000> hows it going?
[11:37:31] <shoky> kk sleepy
[11:37:31] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: i lied http://jsbin.com/welcome/60471/edit keyup is what you want
[11:37:34] <shoky> sup
[11:37:48] <BillCriswell> "Programmers are usually logical, intelligent, individuals, who tell it like it is. Executives hate that." damn, well said haha.
[11:37:51] <ogk1000> need something similar to yesterday hoping you can point me in the right direction
[11:37:52] <ogk1000> http://collabedit.com/54q2x
[11:38:46] <kracekumar_> dblosevn, oh, let me check that
[11:39:11] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: doesnt work on paste though if you use the mouse cant seem to find an event that will
[11:39:44] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: the click is fire way before the data is pasted so its not capturing it
[11:40:51] <kracekumar_> dblosevn, let me checl with mousedown as well
[11:41:40] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: mousedown isnt going to help you because the mouse is not down over the element when they click paste the mouse is below the element
[11:44:48] <therealkoopa> Is it possible to zoom or scale a div that has scrollbars (large scrollWidth/scrollHeight) so everything is visible within the div without the scrollbars?
[11:46:38] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: that seems to work http://jsbin.com/welcome/60475/edit
[11:48:57] <jacoluta> kracekumar_: http://jsbin.com/welcome/60472/edit
[11:49:03] <jacoluta> maybe not the most elegant solution
[11:49:32] <kracekumar_> dblosevn, mousemove is hack for right - click paste
[11:50:38] <kracekumar_> jacoluta, but works well.
[11:50:46] <jacoluta> :)
[11:50:52] <jacoluta> your going to want to adjust it a bit
[11:50:58] <jacoluta> because it will keep calling that interval
[11:51:09] <jacoluta> if you move your mouse over the input
[11:51:10] <shoky> don't need a hack for right-click paste.. use 'input' event
[11:51:59] <prilax> hello
[11:52:06] <prilax> is anyone there
[11:52:41] <shoky> prilax: who, specifically?
[11:52:54] <veQue> http://tinyurl.com/cmb3vrj anyone think this is a good deal? or is there a better 27 in monitor i can get?
[11:52:55] <R00tk3y> Shoky, how would you handle ajax callbacks?
[11:53:14] <R00tk3y> Say like "ERROR-INVALID-PASSWORD" for say a password form
[11:53:14] <BillCriswell> http://boptopop.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/l9kph.jpg
[11:53:14] <shoky> R00tk3y: if you could ask that again, would you keep it the same?
[11:53:22] <shoky> derp
[11:53:28] <R00tk3y> Lol
[11:53:36] <R00tk3y> I meant like handle the JSON from the callback
[11:53:41] <R00tk3y> Right now im using a switch derp
[11:53:53] <shoky> donno what yer asking..
[11:53:58] <shoky> i'd make a callback
[11:54:02] <shoky> and put some logic in it
[11:54:03] <shoky> ?
[11:54:06] <R00tk3y> Data returned from Ajax response
[11:54:12] <shoky> data is data
[11:54:17] <R00tk3y> You try to login in to a form, password is wrong
[11:54:24] <R00tk3y> I know but is there a better way to handle it than a switch
[11:54:28] <R00tk3y> switch(data)
[11:54:38] <shoky> that really depends on the data..
[11:54:45] <R00tk3y> if(data.status == "BAD-LOGIN") {} if(data.status == "GOOD-LOGIN) {}
[11:55:00] <jacoluta> ^
[11:55:17] <shoky> that's one way to do it.. you could seperate the logic into functions and objects and abstract it out if you wanna
[11:55:31] <R00tk3y> Alright, thats what Im doing so i guess ill keep it that way
[11:55:40] <kracekumar_> dblosevn, jacoluta thanks a lot
[11:55:41] <systemfault> One upon a time.... there was a thing called HTTP... and it supported status codes.
[11:55:44] <R00tk3y> Wasnt sure if there was some pro jquery way of doing it
[11:55:47] <jacoluta> kracekumar_: NP
[11:55:50] <brend_> BillCriswell: haha good one
[11:55:56] <raj> systemfault, shouldn't he still do that too?
[11:56:00] <R00tk3y> Systemfault, once upon a time, a status code wouldnt work
[11:56:08] <systemfault> raj: Still does.
[11:56:23] <R00tk3y> Systemfault all I can is lol
[11:56:25] <raj> hi shoky
[11:56:34] <jacoluta> status codes ahah
[11:56:38] <shoky> hy rajy
[11:56:41] <R00tk3y> I know right
[11:56:44] <jacoluta> 500 500 500
[11:56:45] <raj> don't they automatically kick you for saying hi to too many people?
[11:56:51] <R00tk3y> Here systemfault let me refresh your brain on status codes
[11:56:51] <R00tk3y> http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html
[11:56:54] <raj> i gotta keep my friends on cap
[11:57:07] <shoky> hiiii
[11:57:12] <R00tk3y> Now say I wanted to tell the web page "LOGIN-OK"
[11:57:13] <raj> almost said hi to systemfault too
[11:57:17] <R00tk3y> Maybe send it 404 right?
[11:57:19] <R00tk3y> lol
[11:57:29] <jacoluta> nah send dat page a 500
[11:57:34] <R00tk3y> LOL
[11:57:37] <jacoluta> :D
[11:57:47] <R00tk3y> Nah
[11:57:50] <R00tk3y> We'll send a 410
[11:57:52] <jacoluta> 303
[11:57:55] <shoky> R00tk3y sure there are pro jquery ways of doing it
[11:57:58] <R00tk3y> You sent us a password? LOL ITS GONE BRO
[11:57:58] <shoky> but you have to be a pro ;D
[11:58:18] <R00tk3y> Well guess im not doing it then Shoky, b/c im not a pro im a scrub
[11:58:31] <R00tk3y> I think im going to take Systemfaults input and use that
[11:58:54] <R00tk3y> Im gonna send the website different status codes, that way the ajax response will never know if it completed or not
[11:58:57] <shoky> didn't you try to refute him tho
[11:59:02] <kripster> could someone tell me when I click on a collapsible tab that is set as expanded as default it collapses but when i expand it it slidetoggles, i want it to do slidetoggle for both collapse and expand, am using the following: $('[data-role="collapsible"]').bind('collapse expand', function () {
[11:59:02] <kripster>         $(this).find("#information").slideToggle(500);
[11:59:03] <kripster>         return false;
[11:59:03] <kripster>     });
[11:59:09] <R00tk3y> Shoky, YOU CANT DO THAT
[11:59:20] <shoky> lul
[11:59:31] <R00tk3y> How is the ajax request going to know if the request ever worked?
[11:59:43] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: ya i couldnt find another event that would fire for paste
[12:00:01] <shoky> R00tk3y: donno your last few sentences confuzzled me
[12:00:16] <R00tk3y> A status code for example is 404 "Page not found"
[12:00:19] <kracekumar_> dblosevn, ctrl + v works but right->click paste doesn't
[12:00:22] <MarcGuay> Are plugin questions alrighty?
[12:00:37] <jacoluta> i know them all pretty much
[12:00:41] <jacoluta> thats what college is for
[12:00:44] <R00tk3y> If I start manipulating these and making custom status codes, it won't know the response
[12:00:51] <jacoluta> fill me up with useless http return codes
[12:00:57] <jacoluta> is good for*
[12:01:05] <R00tk3y> Jacoluta, my college is google
[12:01:16] <shoky> R00tk3y: then youre not gonna do it? or you are?
[12:01:21] <jacoluta> R00tk3y: yea! thats a good teacher
[12:01:23] <R00tk3y> No im not
[12:01:30] <shoky> but..but.. systemfault.
[12:01:31] <R00tk3y> I can't it wouldn't work
[12:01:57] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: in my last solution ctrl v and right click paste work
[12:02:01] <R00tk3y> Systemfault tried to act like he knew what he was saying, and then fucked it all up lol
[12:02:12] <shoky> ;]
[12:02:39] <R00tk3y> "Well Return codes, you see you can send custom ones, like 802 and we will always expect that the request went through
[12:02:43] <systemfault> I can't believe that people are allowed to do backend when they don't understand the basics of http..
[12:03:16] <shoky> some of them probably dont understand html
[12:03:18] <R00tk3y> Yeah, maybe if you knew what status codes were used for
[12:03:37] <systemfault> To dance?
[12:03:45] <kracekumar_> dblosevn, yea, mousemove
[12:04:11] <R00tk3y> Systemfault, must be your first week with the Apache web server
[12:04:18] <shoky> kracekumar_: did you try 'input' event?
[12:04:19] <jtal> Am I supposed to escape special characters in selectors? I did so because I saw it in an example and later found out it didnt work in IE. No escaping seems to work?
[12:04:34] <R00tk3y> jtal, encode them?
[12:04:48] <jtal> ok
[12:04:55] <kracekumar_> shoky, first time I am hearing input event, you mean, .on('input') ?
[12:05:07] <shoky> kracekumar_: yes, i already said it before heh
[12:05:18] <shoky> kracekumar_: no need for a hack, afaik
[12:05:31] <kracekumar_> shoky, I missed it, let me try it
[12:05:46] <jacoluta> derp
[12:05:47] <jacoluta> haha
[12:06:02] <jacoluta> http://jsbin.com/welcome/60487/edit
[12:06:04] <jacoluta> LOL
[12:06:06] <systemfault> R00tk3y: Tell me how sending back a 403 when the authentication fails is bad.
[12:06:19] <systemfault> Just curious to know what your reasoning is.
[12:06:48] <jacoluta> I think is he just trolling
[12:07:01] <jacoluta> kracekumar_: ^
[12:07:37] <jtal> systemfault: isnt there a code just for that?
[12:07:58] <systemfault> jtal: 403 is "Forbidden", it's exactly for that purpose..
[12:08:02] <jtal> 401
[12:08:07] <jtal> unauthorized
[12:08:14] <kracekumar_> shoky, \o/ works like charm
[12:08:16] <shoky> isnt there a code for 403
[12:08:24] <shoky> kracekumar_: sweetz
[12:08:25] <kracekumar_> jacoluta, I forgot to notice 'input'
[12:08:36] <jacoluta> kracekumar_: not to burst your bubble but since that button is being dished up via client side they can just enable it themselves
[12:08:42] <systemfault> jtal: Unauthorized is when you tried to access a resource without credentials, you would usual get a popup on the browser
[12:08:47] <jacoluta> im not really sure what end-goal you are trying to achieve
[12:08:55] <jacoluta> but if it is some sort of auth componenet
[12:09:12] <systemfault> jtal: Then if you fill that form with bad credentials, you'd get a 403
[12:09:16] <jacoluta> you may want to dish it up server-side
[12:09:37] <kripster> any ideas why this code works fine but when i put it in my solution is only does the slidetoggle on expand and not collapse??
[12:09:39] <kripster> http://jsfiddle.net/VtVFB/319/
[12:09:53] <jtal> wikipedia seems to think 403 means you gave good credentials but you arent authorized to use it
[12:09:54] <kracekumar_> jacoluta, its actually way to tag the speaker in a video, if enable it in client side, server side will catch and send approriate error message
[12:09:59] <jtal> authorization instead of authentication
[12:10:19] <kracekumar_> *enabled
[12:10:20] <jacoluta> kracekumar_: oh yea good point
[12:10:21] <jtal> or there was no auth required but its just not allowed
[12:11:16] <jacoluta> kripster: where is your solution?
[12:11:23] <systemfault> jtal: That would make sense
[12:11:52] <systemfault> jtal: I think you're right.
[12:12:10] <jtal> hooray! it finally happened
[12:13:31] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: wow nice http://jsbin.com/welcome/60492/edit
[12:13:52] <dblosevn> shoky: learn something new from you everyday I swear I didnt even know input was an event
[12:14:10] <kracekumar_> dblosevn, seriously, so much cleaner
[12:14:42] <kripster> the working solution is here http://jsfiddle.net/VtVFB/319/
[12:15:06] <shoky> dblosevn: ;] of course, i learned about it here as well ;]
[12:15:52] <dblosevn> shoky: ya I keep this chat on my second monitor and just read most of the time when im working lol
[12:16:00] <kracekumar_> seriously google should IRC logs too and display in search results
[12:16:05] <kracekumar_> *search
[12:16:16] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: google does lol
[12:16:20] <voot545> what's the best way to find a unique element
[12:16:41] <voot545> are all elements indexed with an ID number by jQuery ?
[12:16:42] <kracekumar_> dblosevn, so far I have never been shown any result in irc though
[12:16:52] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: there was a relativly embarrasing statement i made years ago in an irc room that stayed at the top of google for relational database forever,...
[12:17:04] <kracekumar_> :P
[12:18:00] <kripster> if the exact same solution on ripple emulator thru googlechrome it does not collapse correctly http://jsbin.com/welcome/60492/edit
[12:18:13] <kripster> http://jsfiddle.net/VtVFB/319/
[12:18:20] <dblosevn> kracekumar_: just chacked thank god its gone now lmao
[12:18:35] <kracekumar_> dblosevn, unfair by google
[12:18:40] <dblosevn> pretty sure is was in #vb.net
[12:20:02] <dblosevn> even remember i was talking to Teycho lmao in like 2007 lmao
[12:20:43] <shoky> voot545:  put an id attribute on the element.
[12:20:53] <shoky> voot545: all elements are indexed by their ID, by the browser
[12:21:22] <jacoluta> kra
[12:21:27] <jacoluta> kracekumar_: http://jsbin.com/welcome/60493/edit
[12:21:30] <jacoluta> even shorter :D
[12:21:48] <kripster> also if you notice in the code the icon does not change from + to -, but in my solution it does bizarre http://jsfiddle.net/VtVFB/319/
[12:21:53] <eizdealer> hey guys, i'm looking for a jquery / jquery ui plugin which allows the cropping of an imageâ€¦ well essentially it should only return the cropped coordinates to the server. does something like this exist?
[12:22:49] <eizdealer> oh lol stupid meâ€¦ http://deepliquid.com/projects/Jcrop/demos.php
[12:23:30] <jacoluta> kracekumar_: you like that ?! :D
[12:24:21] <kracekumar_> jacoluta, readability suffers :-)
[12:24:22] <kracekumar_> but shorter
[12:24:22] <kracekumar_> ternary operator
[12:24:41] <jacoluta> oh what!!!
[12:24:45] <jacoluta> ternary's are boss
[12:25:09] <jacoluta> kracekumar_: so your not going to use it ;(
[12:27:17] <kracekumar_> jacoluta, I want to use it, because it shorter, clever
[12:27:42] <jacoluta> :D YEA!
[12:28:04] <BinaryKitten> tenarys are not always the best
[12:28:12] <jacoluta> BinaryKitten: agreed
[12:28:23] <BinaryKitten> and just because something is clever doesn't mean it's the best either
[12:28:31] <jacoluta> but in this case he has, and will always have, only 2 possilbe outcomes
[12:28:47] <jacoluta> ternary in this case is 100% suitable
[12:29:13] <BinaryKitten> var x = y ? y : z;  style?
[12:29:21] <denderle> hi
[12:29:22] <kracekumar_> BinaryKitten, ternary is bad, since you binary ;-)
[12:29:31] <kracekumar_> *your
[12:29:37] <jacoluta> BinaryKitten: what was your question?
[12:29:39] <BinaryKitten> oh ha ha You Krace me up
[12:29:47] <kracekumar_> *or you are
[12:30:18] <BinaryKitten> jacoluta i don't have a question really
[12:30:23] <jacoluta> oh lol
[12:30:25] <jacoluta> u did style?
[12:30:30] <jacoluta> thought u had one
[12:30:43] <BinaryKitten> was interested in the ternary of choice
[12:30:52] <Eviltwin> Isn't y ? y : z equivalent to y || z
[12:30:54] <BinaryKitten> but that's not precisely a big question
[12:31:01] <BinaryKitten> Eviltwin that's where i was heading
[12:31:15] <Eviltwin> JavaScript's version of the Elvis operator
[12:31:16] <Eviltwin> ?:
[12:31:17] <bot-t> the elvis operator
[12:31:25] <kracekumar_> here i feel ternary is straight forward choice, but you will read that piece of code atleast twice
[12:31:49] <BinaryKitten> C = A || B;
[12:32:03] <kracekumar_> I totally forgot the ternary operator for long time.
[12:32:09] <exit2> is anyone here familiar with FullCalendar?
[12:32:17] <BinaryKitten> kracekumar_ it's a good job too
[12:32:26] <BinaryKitten> otherwise we'd not be chatting about jquery
[12:32:31] <jacoluta> BinaryKitten: you really dont like ternary?
[12:32:39] <kracekumar_> :P BinaryKitten
[12:32:42] <BinaryKitten> jacoluta i don't not likle them
[12:33:02] <BinaryKitten> it's just people use them "for speed" and "performance" and that's the bit i don't like
[12:33:17] <kripster> any ideas why this working code http://jsfiddle.net/VtVFB/323/ only slidetoggle(expands) but not on collapse with googlechrome ripple emulator??
[12:33:19] <BinaryKitten> i'd rather have clearly defined code that runs that millisecond slower
[12:33:19] <jacoluta> you dont like 'speed' and 'performance'
[12:33:53] <BinaryKitten> jacoluta again not my direct meaning..
[12:34:11] <BinaryKitten> speed and performance are important, but not as important as maintainable code
[12:34:28] <BinaryKitten> there's no point making something super fast if no one can fix it when it goes wrong
[12:34:29] <jacoluta> ^ agreed
[12:34:51] <jacoluta> i find ternary easier to read then if (){}else{}
[12:35:08] <kracekumar_> BinaryKitten, do you like python ?
[12:35:09] <BinaryKitten> sometimes i do to, but not all the time
[12:35:19] <BinaryKitten> kracekumar_ not used that much python
[12:35:29] <jacoluta> well i only use them in specific case
[12:35:39] <jacoluta> the case in which there is, and will only ever be two outcomes
[12:35:53] <jacoluta> im not going to start nesting those bitches
[12:35:56] <jacoluta> no one can read that
[12:36:03] <jacoluta> not even Mr. Ternary himself
[12:36:17] <BinaryKitten> if there are only 2 outcomes, and you want to used the 2nd only if the 1st is not present etc
[12:36:18] <alwayslearning> hey everyone hows it going
[12:36:30] <BinaryKitten> i prefer the "1st || 2nd;"
[12:36:39] <BinaryKitten> over "1st ? 1st : 2nd"
[12:36:55] <jacoluta> well i wouldnt use it in that case either
[12:36:57] <alwayslearning> Is anyone familiar with Fancybox? http://fancybox.net/
[12:36:57] <BinaryKitten> but again that's prefence for you
[12:37:09] <BinaryKitten> ?ask @ alwayslearning
[12:37:10] <bot-t> alwayslearning, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:37:29] <BinaryKitten> ?peace @ alwayslearning
[12:37:30] <bot-t> alwayslearning, please Pastebin: Expected result, Actual result, all (relevant) Code, any Errors/Exceptions - This is *not* a multiple-choice request, we need all of them
[12:37:37] <alwayslearning> Does anyone know how to set Fancybox to have no resize and display the image in its native resolution?
[12:39:03] <alwayslearning> This is my fancybox script http://jsfiddle.net/QSUpb/
[12:39:44] <Bish> if im having $.post(url,data,callback,"json"); how can i, give that callback some data?
[12:39:58] <jacoluta> autoScale: false
[12:40:02] <kripster> anyone know why this will not collapse as slidetoggle but will expand slidetoggle?? http://jsfiddle.net/VtVFB/323/
[12:40:05] <jacoluta> alwayslearning: ^
[12:40:39] <Bish> a.e var item ={"wayho":";)"}; $.post(url,{'someParam':'someValue'},callback,"json",item); and the stuff will have item
[12:40:45] <jacoluta> kripster: it works both ways here
[12:41:07] <BinaryKitten> Bish as long as the callback is created in scope
[12:41:14] <Avanyk> heya
[12:41:16] <BinaryKitten> it has access to all variables/data in parent scope
[12:41:16] <Bish> it is not.
[12:41:21] <kripster> i now but when i run it in my solution using ripple emulator in googlechrome it only expands properely
[12:41:32] <Bish> ah.. that's the problem, cool, eh.. but this would make my code messy
[12:41:35] <BinaryKitten> Bish then we gonna need a pastebin
[12:41:38] <Avanyk> Can I .load() to a div that the .load() command exists within?
[12:41:47] <Avanyk> er method*
[12:41:49] <Bish> BinaryKitten, would mcallback = globalcallback; work?
[12:41:56] <kripster> if you notice the + and - icon doesnt change but it does with ripple, is there a better way to implement the method??
[12:42:03] <Bish> or would that be the same reference
[12:42:09] <BinaryKitten> same ref
[12:42:10] <Bish> and not change the scope of the callback
[12:42:23] <Bish> can i somehow change the scope of the callback?
[12:42:40] <BinaryKitten> nope, well yes, but not in the way ytou're thinking
[12:42:49] <Bish> meh.
[12:42:49] <alwayslearning> @jacoluta autoScale is set to false already
[12:42:49] <b-ot> alwayslearning, memorised â€œautoScaleâ€.
[12:44:41] <Avanyk> Anyone?
[12:44:54] <Avanyk> Pretty simple question I would think
[12:45:10] <voot545> anyone know of a good reference on .find(element), I don't understand what criteria of the element passed are used when determining when items are found
[12:45:48] <BinaryKitten> voot545 it's a selector
[12:45:57] <BinaryKitten> it's used to find items within itmes
[12:46:00] <kripster> no ideas jacoluta
[12:46:10] <jacoluta> kripster: im lookin
[12:46:19] <voot545> is it unique though?
[12:46:21] <BinaryKitten> eg var md = $('#mydiv');  md.find('li');  will get all the li in #myDiv
[12:46:31] <BinaryKitten> is it unique?
[12:46:45] <BinaryKitten> it shouldn't be unique
[12:46:46] <voot545> I'm talking about passing a single element, the actual dom element
[12:46:50] <voot545> not a string selector
[12:47:07] <BinaryKitten> why do you need to find the domElement?
[12:47:07] <kripster> if you run the code direct on googlechrome it doesnt work either
[12:47:10] <jacoluta> kripster: what ripple setting are u using
[12:47:10] <BinaryKitten> when you have it?
[12:47:38] <kripster> i disable ripple and display the page thru chrome, same thing, not working on collapse
[12:47:42] <voot545> I do some stuff to its children
[12:47:50] <voot545> (sounds not right)
[12:47:52] <jacoluta> kripster: er platform
[12:48:11] <BinaryKitten> voot545 but why do you need to "find" it
[12:48:21] <BinaryKitten> $(element).children() .....
[12:48:36] <Bish> v8> 'test'
[12:48:37] <kripster> yeah sounds like it, is there a better way to implement it?
[12:49:34] <voot545> I grab an element, a single element, then I go along processing other elements around that element, but I want to stop once I'm not inside that element anymore
[12:49:36] <katsh> How can i be 100% sure an event happened? I add a button to a div (button was gotten with $.get()), and it only works sometimes. sometimes the page loads and the button is there, sometimes it's not. I have if ($('#content').html(button)) {console.log("added")}
[12:50:00] <katsh> but it always shows 'added' on the console, even whe the button doesn't show. which is like 90% of the times
[12:50:38] <voot545> so in short, I grab a .parent(), I store it, and then I'm traversing not just siblings, but other places as well, and I want to be sure that I'm still inside that parent
[12:52:46] <voot545> so naturally I thought that I could check .parents(myparentIwanttoStayIn) for my other elements I'm working with that are around the page
[12:53:22] <voot545> or .parents().find(parentIwantToStayInside)
[12:53:31] <voot545> but it's not been working
[12:53:51] <jtm> If I had something like <tr data-blah="1"></tr> <tr data-blah="2"></tr> ... <tr data-blah="N"></tr> where N = some integer, what would be the best way to pull the values out of data-blah and store them in an array?
[12:54:03] <samholmes> is there a common way to reorder elements?
[12:54:18] <jtm> Would it be a .each() with a push?
[12:54:34] <systemfault> jtm: Perhaps you could use .map
[12:55:08] <samholmes> jtm: You could use .each(), or .map()
[12:55:09] <systemfault> $('tr').map(function() { return $(this).attr('data-blah'); });
[12:55:33] <jtm> Would it be possible to add the elements with .map to a current array?
[12:55:34] <samholmes> Now, is there a common way to order a list of elements by a certain criteria
[12:56:16] <samholmes> $list.each(function(){ if ($(this).find('.status').text() == 'online') 'put it before other elements'; else 'put it after other elements'; })
[12:57:08] <Bish> BinaryKitten, yay, it works, thank you very much, js is awesome
[12:57:09] <samholmes> jtm: .map is almost the same as .each, the only difference is that the return value in .map's function is used to build an array
[12:57:41] <jtm> which would require another O(n) to merge with another array?
[12:57:43] <samholmes> jtm: So, you could do other things in the .map loop, such as populate other arrays
[12:58:17] <jtm> How is .map any different than using .each then? I mean can't I just use .each?
[12:58:24] <samholmes> What's this 0(n) talk, I never understood what that notation meant exactly.
[12:58:42] <samholmes> jtm: You could use .each, I already said you could.
[12:58:53] <samholmes> jtm: but .map also returns the array all built for you.
[12:58:55] <jtm> Because if I did .map, it'd return an array, then I'd have to go through that array again to push its values onto another array.
[12:59:14] <samholmes> jtm: systemfault's last message would evaluate to the array you want to build
[12:59:40] <samholmes> jtm: Or you could just merge the two arrays
[12:59:53] <jtm> Yes, :)  I understand. I think I'll go with .each(), because I could do the .push() inside it.
[13:00:15] <samholmes> jtm: array.conact(array2)
[13:00:50] <jtm> samholmes Just concerned about speed, because this array could potential grow to thousands of elements, and copying elements over could be costly.
[13:01:21] <jtm> instead of an O(1) operation like a .push, unless a .push() isn't O(1) for some reason in javascript.
[13:06:40] <Kambfhase> .push() is fast
[13:06:40] <b-ot> Kambfhase, memorised â€œpush()â€.
[13:07:06] <jtm> lol
[13:07:21] <Kambfhase> .forget push
[13:07:21] <b-ot> Kambfhase, I canâ€™t forget that which I do not know.
[13:07:25] <Kambfhase> .forget push()
[13:09:04] <shoky> O(n)+O(n) = O(n)
[13:09:18] <jtm> Still a constant factor
[13:09:24] <shoky> indeed
[13:09:50] <shoky> but you'd get that same factor if you did just one loop that does the 2 things inside.
[13:10:15] <shoky> tho i didnt really read the whole discussion, just blabbing
[13:11:26] <jtm> I didn't want to use .map then merging arrays afterwards. I was suggesting doing .each and doing a .push inside.
[13:12:06] <jtm> Though that's assuming .each and .map are equal in performance.
[13:12:20] <jtm> I have a feeling that .map is a wrapper of .each in some way, no?
[13:12:33] <shoky> they're both just loops in the end
[13:12:46] <shoky> and in modern browsers they just use the built-in .forEach and .map
[13:12:52] <jtm> But the creation of the array from .map requires more work.
[13:12:53] <jtm> Right?
[13:13:05] <shoky> sure..
[13:13:11] <shoky> more work than doing nothing, yes
[13:13:16] <systemfault> There's negligible overhead.... and there's that..
[13:13:28] <jtm> :)
[13:13:44] <systemfault> JS itself is very fast, don't worry about that...
[13:13:49] <systemfault> DOM is the problem..
[13:14:55] <Kambfhase> JS also has its slow parts
[13:14:58] <Jzarecta> hi I am trying to get this JQuery plugin running but is not working can anyone check my code? http://jsfiddle.net/FqD2p/
[13:15:24] <systemfault> Kambfhase: Do you mind giving us an example?
[13:15:49] <Kambfhase> function execution
[13:16:16] <Jzarecta> not sure what I am missing, the example seems easy enough
[13:16:24] <systemfault> Hmm... so you're complaining that doing something requires more work than not doing it?
[13:16:31] <systemfault> Slow compared to what?
[13:16:55] <Kambfhase> Array.prototype.forEach is slower than a simple for loop
[13:17:12] <systemfault> But they're not the same thing...
[13:17:28] <Kambfhase> Jzarecta: you dont seem to be loading the plugin at all
[13:18:11] <Kambfhase> h, wait
[13:18:44] <Drager> MistuhKurtz: That worked fine. Thank you :)
[13:19:00] <Kambfhase> well, that plugins throws an error, so it does not get loaded properly
[13:29:14] <jtm> If I did $('tr').each, is there a way to do this same type of thing with a variable with html in it? So apply this on the variable instead of the page?
[13:30:02] <dotDeeka> jtm: something like $( var_w_html ).find('tr').each
[13:30:27] <jtm> thanks!! :)
[13:30:45] <dotDeeka> no problem
[13:31:35] <zubelgenubi> For some reason, firefox is showing bullets next to my jquery mobile listview...
[13:32:06] <zubelgenubi> well, collapsible set.  Maybe I did something wrong
[13:34:46] <jtm> dotDeeka Unfortunately it's not working :(
[13:37:19] <firstclassfunc> why is web programming so boring?
[13:37:39] <dotDeeka> jtm: check out http://jsfiddle.net/dotDeeka/nBspQ/2/
[13:37:47] <tw2113> it's a matter of opinion firstclassfunc
[13:37:53] <Kambfhase> couz 90% of the time its not programming.
[13:38:11] <zubelgenubi> There is someting wrong here: webkit shows my collapsible set UL items correctly, but moz and ie show bullets. IE even separates my accordion items
[13:38:15] <dotDeeka> jtm: sorry http://jsfiddle.net/dotDeeka/nBspQ/3/
[13:38:55] <jtm> Hmm
[13:39:25] <firstclassfunc> Kambfhase: indeed
[13:39:35] <systemfault> I found most web backend programming to be boring....
[13:39:42] <systemfault> Frontend can be enjoyable.
[13:41:45] <Kocho> hey.. does anyone know how Soundcloud did their new continuous player at the top of the website?
[13:42:01] <firstclassfunc> at times, but it's really not satisfying. most solutions turn into hacks quite easily
[13:43:49] <systemfault> firstclassfunc: Except when dealing with IE7 and CSS, I don't need to do a lot of hacks
[13:44:04] <jtm> dotDeeka What if I don't have <table></table> surrounding the <tr>?
[13:44:18] <jtm> dotDeeka http://jsfiddle.net/nBspQ/8/
[13:45:55] <firstclassfunc> systemfault: yeah, I just think it's difficult to build e.g. single page apps while keeping your code very structured
[13:46:19] <misteroneill> Kocho: all i know is they rebuilt their app as a single-page app using backbone. some useful stuff here: http://backstage.soundcloud.com/2012/06/building-the-next-soundcloud/
[13:47:40] <dotDeeka> jtm: not sure but your trying to alert the text of a tr. if you switch it to .find('td') it works
[13:47:54] <Kocho> thanks misteroneill
[13:48:06] <jtm> dotDeeka But it's not iterating over it.
[13:48:11] <jtm> That's the exact issue I'm having
[13:48:16] <dotDeeka> you should be able to call .html() on .find('tr') but for some reason your right it doesn't work
[13:48:18] <dotDeeka> weird
[13:48:32] <jtm> Because I have just <tr></tr>, and I need an attribute from them
[13:48:52] <jtm> Many <tr></tr> that is :)
[13:48:59] <jtm> With stuff inside, but that stuff isn't important
[13:49:15] <jtm> <tr> is outer most
[13:55:32] <Caelum> I'm getting this error: "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #function each(iterator, context) { ..." I think it's because I'm loading prototype.js, but I added jQuery.noConflict() after both of them are loaded
[13:59:57] <katsh> can i use on() with $.get
[14:00:18] <shoky> jtm:  http://jsfiddle.net/nBspQ/10/
[14:00:28] <shoky> jtm: .find only looks for descendants of the root element
[14:00:57] <jtm> $rows.each(function() {  Seemed to fix it.
[14:01:04] <jtm> without the .find
[14:01:14] <jtm> Since it's always outer most.
[14:01:30] <shoky> sure, if you dont need to find/filter anything
[14:01:43] <jtm> yup :)
[14:01:50] <jtm> As long as <tr> remains the top element...
[14:01:56] <jtm> which shouldn't change
[14:02:22] <misteroneill> katsh: how do you mean "use on() with $.get"?
[14:05:38] <rmill> katsh: You can use anything with anything, you just gotta believeâ„¢
[14:07:04] <jtm> I'm using $.param on an array, but it seems to not be serializing it properly. It's just undefined=&undefined=&undefined=...
[14:08:05] <shoky> jtm: are you doing it per the docs?
[14:08:18] <Caelum> shoky: any idea on my conflict problem?
[14:08:30] <jtm> I did my own js array, so I'll probably need to convert it into some jquery array, right?
[14:08:32] <Caelum> shoky: or any way I can get a backtrace from an error inside jquery.js
[14:08:34] <shoky> jtm: If the object passed is in an Array, it must be an array of objects in the format returned by .serializeArray()
[14:09:30] <shoky> Caelum: where is that error coming from
[14:09:51] <jtm> shoky Is there a way to do it without dealing with converting this native js array into jquery's serialize?
[14:10:26] <shoky> jtm:  what does your array look like?
[14:10:40] <jtm> Just [1,2,3,4,5,6,7...] type of stuff
[14:10:47] <jtm> except more random integers.
[14:10:56] <shoky> how is that params with values?
[14:11:03] <shoky> doesnt make sense
[14:11:12] <shoky> params need a name and a value
[14:11:33] <jtm> I just wanted it to serialize to 0: 35062, 1: 34886... etc
[14:11:43] <jtm> using the index as the name
[14:11:45] <shoky> oh
[14:11:49] <Caelum> shoky: jquery.min.js
[14:12:01] <shoky> Caelum: and the stack trace?
[14:12:03] <jtm> I don't care how it does it, I just need it to be so I can use it in PHP :)
[14:12:11] <jtm> and foreach over it
[14:12:20] <Caelum> shoky: when I click on stack trace in chrome, it shows nothing :(
[14:12:30] <Caelum> shoky: and I don't even know how to get a stack trace in safari
[14:12:58] <khaan> hi guys - i want to make a menu that sticks to the top when scrolling. Like everyone in 2012. The most idiot proof version EVER, because i don't make an exception :)
[14:13:22] <Caelum> khaan: those are incredibly annoying, please don't
[14:13:36] <khaan> caelum: it's a tough planet.
[14:13:41] <Caelum> khaan: but if you must, it's just position: fixed in CSS
[14:13:43] <shoky> Caelum: i donno, without seeing more..
[14:13:54] <khaan> no, it's not position: fixed because it uses waypoints
[14:14:02] <khaan> i had found out a script but it's not working
[14:14:05] <jtm> it is position: fixed from what I've seen
[14:14:17] <misteroneill> why do something with a script that can be easily done with a line of css?
[14:14:32] <misteroneill> we have a sticky footer in our app and it just uses position: fixed.
[14:15:22] <shoky> jtm: dont know of a way to do that without mapping the array
[14:15:26] <katsh> i believe
[14:16:21] <jtm> shoky Aww ok, I guess I'd have to use that... blah
[14:16:26] <jtm> because this list could get very long
[14:16:53] <shoky> jtm: if it's long.. why are you serializing it into a query string?
[14:17:11] <jtm> Well I am not sure, it COULD get long
[14:17:27] <shoky> why not JSON?
[14:17:34] <jtm> I'm building an ignore list for my sql query, so not display stuff that is already displayed.
[14:17:43] <jtm> That was what I wanted
[14:17:48] <jtm> isn't $.param doing JSON automatically?
[14:17:56] <shoky> no, far from it
[14:18:01] <jtm> oh.. eww
[14:18:12] <jtm> ok, how can I JSON a regular native JS array? :)
[14:18:14] <khaan> so, any help?
[14:18:58] <shoky> jtm:  well, JSON.stringify(array)  but if you're using $.ajax or equivalent you prolly dont need to stringify it yourself
[14:19:15] <shoky> and if you're gonna send a lot of data maybe, i hope you're using POST , not GET
[14:19:21] <jtm> So if I just pass in the array, it'll do it automatically?
[14:19:25] <jtm> I'm using POST
[14:19:33] <shoky> pretty much..
[14:19:37] <shoky> well
[14:19:39] <shoky> no sorry
[14:19:52] <shoky> you should stringify it yourself
[14:20:13] <jtm> ok
[14:20:42] <shoky> like.. $.ajax({url:'bla', type:'POST', data: {myArray: JSON.stringify(array) } )
[14:20:45] <jtm> I wish there was a cleaner solution
[14:20:54] <shoky> this is pretty clean^
[14:21:11] <jtm> I mean to my issue of passing in shown ids
[14:21:13] <jtm> but I guess not
[14:21:24] <jtm> Unless I keep track of it with some redis server
[14:22:32] <shoky> shrugs
[14:22:33] <b-ot> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[14:23:04] <jtm> shoky It's going to be a huge list, if they scroll down enough. It's like on Pintrest, if you keep scrolling down you don't want to see repeated content, content that was shown before.
[14:23:18] <jtm> shoky so as they scroll down I am building an ignore list.
[14:23:30] <shoky> hm..
[14:23:40] <shoky> im not sure but that sounds.. wrong
[14:23:48] <shoky> the ignore list
[14:23:51] <jtm> But if you scroll far enough, obviously that list could grow huge.
[14:23:57] <shoky> but maybe i donno enough about what yer doin
[14:24:08] <jtm> Then how do keep track of what was already displayed?
[14:24:20] <jtm> without displaying it again
[14:24:46] <shoky> umm
[14:24:52] <jtm> Only solution I can think of is an ignore list which I am building with jquery
[14:24:55] <shoky> how big can this list get
[14:25:01] <jtm> Theoretically thousands
[14:25:06] <shoky> not theoretically
[14:25:11] <jtm> Depending on how far they scroll
[14:25:19] <shoky> why, there are 9999999999999999 items?
[14:25:33] <jtm> no, the size will never become too large.
[14:25:48] <jtm> My guess is up to 100,000 or more...
[14:25:50] <shoky> i mean.. after a while they'll get through all of it, no?
[14:25:58] <shoky> k
[14:25:59] <jtm> eventually
[14:26:01] <shoky> and umm
[14:26:05] <jtm> If they scroll and scroll
[14:26:20] <jtm> I'm only loading in ~50 records.
[14:26:21] <shoky> still the ignore list sounds very inefficient
[14:26:26] <jtm> It does.
[14:26:34] <jtm> But I don't see another solution.
[14:26:37] <shoky> dont these items have some sequential number
[14:26:41] <jtm> no
[14:26:44] <shoky> or.. how do you decide which to load next?
[14:26:52] <shoky> disregarding the ignore list for now
[14:26:59] <jtm> Uses an offset in the database based on the "page" it's on.
[14:27:13] <jtm> which I increment on a .scrollTo after the ajax
[14:27:16] <shoky> so its sequential?
[14:27:28] <jtm> The offset is sequential, the ids possibly not.
[14:27:33] <shoky> right
[14:27:36] <jtm> Since data does get deleted etc
[14:27:40] <shoky> so.. why not save the offset
[14:27:41] <jtm> That's the concern
[14:27:48] <shoky> or some way to get the offset.
[14:27:58] <shoky> plus maybe the "starting" offset
[14:28:02] <jtm> If data disappears the offset will recapture what is already there
[14:28:06] <shoky> so you know when you did a cycle or whateve.r. donno
[14:29:16] <jtm> For example, offset: 0, load 50 in, offset is now 50, load 50 more in, now it's 100. Lets say 20 get deleted. It's assuming offset 100, the database just shifted.
[14:29:26] <jtm> So now the ids it pulls might be ones it pulled before
[14:29:40] <jtm> That's why I am building this jquery ignore list
[14:29:45] <jtm> -jquery
[14:31:09] <shoky> well, yeah if you actually delete stuff from the DB while this ongoing polling is going on... it'll mess up
[14:31:35] <shoky> you can do a logical delete tho
[14:32:08] <jtm> Well it's not deleting the actual row, just flagging it.
[14:32:20] <naeluh> Hi I was looking for a little help regarding a scrollTo issue. when ever i resize the browser I get some movement on div that is irratic not sure if I can fine tune it to get it a little more what I want. I am thinking it is moving because of the adjusment to the panel section but I am not sure and I was wondering if I could get a little help in trying to figure this out let me know what...
[14:32:21] <naeluh> ...info I can provide that would be helpful  here is the link where the problem is happening http://theconfluencegroup.com/new_site/ its the services tab
[14:32:24] <jtm> but the query ignores flagged ones
[14:32:32] <shoky> then you can change that
[14:32:36] <jtm> So just concerned it might pull something that already has been pulled.
[14:34:23] <shoky> also.. you can use timestamps
[14:34:29] <shoky> instead of the offset
[14:35:00] <jtm> Not sure what you mean :)
[14:35:19] <anew> shoky u use require.js ?
[14:35:19] <shoky> hmm me neither, nevermind ;]
[14:35:47] <jtm> Well, I'll think outside of the box, maybe there's a better solution, maybe it just isn't something that would even happen.
[14:35:56] <shoky> anew , used it in one project a while ago
[14:36:01] <anew> meh ok
[14:38:09] <naeluh> Am I  being clear at all as to what I need help with? thanks
[14:38:13] <naeluh> sorry'
[14:38:45] <anew> shoky how is a page able to send ajax without xhr ?
[14:38:52] <Bish> <Bish> hey guys, could someone tell me, if the localstorage of webpages will be clean'd up when the session of the user get's destroyed?
[14:38:52] <Bish> <Bish> do webpages have access to the localstorag
[14:39:34] <sontek> With a deferred doing $.when() ... is there a way to pass an array to when?  It seems to treat a single object as a completed deferred and everything executes right away
[14:39:55] <sontek> but I have a dynamic amount of deferreds that I push into an array and want to wait on all of them
[14:39:57] <Bish> well, answered it mself i guess
[14:40:08] <sontek> Should I be doing something like $.when.apply() ?
[14:40:28] <shoky> anew: what do you mean by "send ajax"
[14:40:43] <shoky> sontek yes
[14:40:57] <shoky> sontek: $.when.apply(null, arrayOfDefferds)
[14:41:34] <sontek> shoky: awesome, thanks, worked perfectly
[14:41:38] <anew> shoky asynch load on page without xhr
[14:41:55] <shoky> anew: hidden iframe is one example
[14:41:56] <anew> load a <script> tag onpage without xhr
[14:42:01] <anew> meh dont think it's that
[14:42:04] <shoky> an example that predates xhr
[14:42:21] <shoky> a <script> tag?
[14:42:27] <shoky> <Script> tags are not loaded with xhr
[14:42:28] <shoky> ever
[14:42:37] <shoky> they are loaded transparently by the browser
[14:42:38] <anew> mmmm u can do it with require and define cant u
[14:42:49] <shoky> wat?
[14:43:36] <shoky> and yes , injecting a <script> tag is another example of async loading data without xhr
[14:44:02] <anew> mmm i thought u just said it wasnt possible ?
[14:44:15] <shoky> said what wasnt possible?
[14:44:20] <anew> how do u inject a <script> tag ?
[14:44:38] <shoky> $.getScript()  or  $('head').append('<script...>')
[14:44:40] <shoky> for exampel.
[14:44:57] <anew> var e = document.createElement('script');
[14:45:00] <anew> like so ?
[14:45:07] <shoky> that's without jquery, sure..
[14:45:12] <anew> i see
[14:45:17] <shoky> $('<script>') is just as good
[14:45:24] <anew> and the only way to inject it is by naming it 'script'
[14:45:24] <anew> ok
[14:45:36] <anew> very interesting
[14:46:29] <anew> mind partially blown
[14:46:31] <anew> not fully blown
[14:46:33] <anew> but partially
[14:46:37] <shoky> lol
[14:46:57] <anew> what about backbone.js
[14:46:59] <anew> u likey?
[14:47:40] <anew> shoky what is the speed difference with injecting a script and loading it via ajax
[14:47:45] <shoky> havent really used backbone, but i likey the MVC/MV* approach for webapp development, yeah. and personally i like knockout.js
[14:47:49] <simulation> guys how can i show animated gif after page being unload or while waiting post response ? sometimes post response takes 10 - 15 seconds to response :S
[14:47:56] <anew> knockout will have to look at that
[14:48:29] <systemfault> shoky: You're the only guy I know who's using knockout :P
[14:48:37] <shoky> xec_ too :P
[14:49:03] <systemfault> :D
[14:49:43] <systemfault> I only worked a lot with backbone... I'm learning ember but I haven't used it so far.
[14:50:04] <shoky> anew: speed difference? i think they both get loaded using the same connection :P
[14:50:25] <anew> but if you inject isnt there better caching ?
[14:50:27] <shoky> i didn't like ember being so opinionated
[14:50:39] <systemfault> shoky: That's why I like it.
[14:51:09] <shoky> welp, i do admit i haven't tried enough shit for real
[14:51:23] <systemfault> Backbone.. I can't use it without LayoutManager for example
[14:51:44] <shoky> dunno what that means ;p
[14:51:57] <systemfault> (A third-party plugin to deal with nested views)
[14:52:22] <shoky> ah
[14:52:49] <shoky> yep ember is the more complete package
[14:53:13] <TrentonDAdams> Hi guys.  Are there any core jquery developers here?  I'm having a problem where I hide some form elements.  Then, through jquery/AJAX, I replace the entire div with an html snippet with the same div, but non-hidden elements.  In mac firefox, safari, and chrome, these elements stay hidden.
[14:53:35] <TrentonDAdams> I don't think that could be a jquery bug.  But I just wanted to ask, incase there's something I don't understand.
[14:55:45] <shoky> TrentonDAdams: what do you mean, "non-hidden elements". HTML isn't supposed to say that
[14:56:02] <TrentonDAdams> I'm not using display:none for example.
[14:56:08] <shoky> inline style attribute?
[14:56:10] <shoky> meh.
[14:56:30] <TrentonDAdams> I ask jquery to hide them, but then the entire tree of elements in the div get replaced with a new div.  In windows/linux, this is great, and the elements re-appear.
[14:56:33] <TrentonDAdams> In mac, they do not.
[14:56:46] <shoky> oh
[14:56:52] <shoky> didnt realize its mac-only
[14:57:02] <TrentonDAdams> yeah, and it's freaking me out, hehe
[14:57:12] <TrentonDAdams> I can execute a show() on document ready, and it fixes the problem.
[14:57:23] <TrentonDAdams> But I'm thinking this is a mac bug in firefox, chrome, and safari.
[14:57:34] <shoky> you're hiding them with .hide()  ?
[14:58:02] <TrentonDAdams> Cause when you replace an entire div, the states of all the elements should be cleared, you would think.
[14:58:09] <TrentonDAdams> shoky, yes, with hide().
[14:58:10] <shoky> anyway.. reproduce it in a jsfiddle
[14:58:21] <TrentonDAdams> shoky: k, just a minute.
[14:58:44] <shoky> the "state" of the elements should be cleared..... true and not true
[14:58:54] <shoky> CSS isn't cleared
[14:59:04] <shoky> (not inline styles)
[14:59:07] <TrentonDAdams> shoky: really?
[14:59:14] <TrentonDAdams> shoky: Oh, doesn't hide() use inline styles?
[14:59:34] <shoky> yeah
[14:59:59] <TrentonDAdams> awe man, I haven't used jsfiddle much, that might take me awhile. :D
[15:00:56] <shoky> how are you replacing the div?
[15:01:01] <TrentonDAdams> replaceWith()
[15:01:04] <TrentonDAdams> shoky: hmm, so does it sound like they should remain hidden then?
[15:01:14] <Caelum> shoky: I traced the error to a jQuery(document).ready(function($) { ... }) call inside a .js file, if I put a console.log() inside the inner function it doesn't print
[15:01:19] <TrentonDAdams> jQuery(divSelector).replaceWith(page);
[15:01:26] <TrentonDAdams> page is just a div with the same id
[15:01:31] <raj> is it possible to make jqui tabs work directly with <ul> instead of needing a parent div?
[15:01:36] <shoky> TrentonDAdams: based on what you said, no.. but a fiddle would settle it
[15:01:57] <TrentonDAdams> shoky: k, I'll try and get something in there.
[15:02:35] <shoky> raj: i doubt it
[15:06:57] <shoky> Caelum: sorry donno, try to pastebin more of the code, maybe someone will catch it
[15:10:15] <naeluh>  basically what I am lookin for is like scrollTo plugin that deals with responsive layouts and always returns to the fragment that was last clicked it seems like I am just getting a little jumping on window resize or is my issue css related ? thanks again
[15:11:07] <ShawnRisk> how do I change the background of content of an active tab?
[15:12:07] <ShawnRisk> I got it
[15:12:45] <raj> shoky, k thank you
[15:15:43] <TrentonDAdams> shoky: Here's a reproduction of what I'm *essentially* doing.  I hide the elements, then I request a new page via AJAX, which returns the exact same HTML.  The encoded replaceWith() is the same as what you see in the HTML section of js fiddle.
[15:16:13] <TrentonDAdams> And, as you can see, if you're not using a mac, it will work.
[15:16:14] <TrentonDAdams> lol
[15:16:21] <TrentonDAdams> http://jsfiddle.net/yDC2M/
[15:17:20] <Caelum> shoky: I found it! Somehow this simple array iteration code is picking up a jquery function: https://gist.github.com/4263242
[15:18:04] <Caelum> shoky: if I change it to an .each call instead, it works correctly
[15:18:51] <itatitat> guys, I'm very confuse, is the first time that this happen me. Im working with sdk facebook api, and look that....some functions dont wait the execution of another functions....
[15:18:53] <itatitat> how is that?
[15:19:17] <itatitat> for example Im getting information with asynchronous, but before to finish, ready to have all the data, jquery jump to the next functions, so I've failures because I havent the data
[15:19:37] <wilornel> though one...
[15:19:51] <wilornel> can I see your code?
[15:19:56] <itatitat> yes
[15:20:00] <itatitat> is a little long....ok
[15:20:03] <wilornel> sure
[15:20:10] <wilornel> give me the exact lines though
[15:20:16] <itatitat> ok
[15:20:18] <wilornel> I mean point me from where to where
[15:21:37] <wilornel> ima brb in 7 minutes
[15:24:40] <itatitat> wilornel: Is here, thanks http://jsfiddle.net/BpQsx/
[15:32:51] <nathancahill> does safari not support synchronous ajax requests?
[15:35:32] <agsel> can I bind a function for button click and wait until it's executed?
[15:35:43] <wilornel> agsel: what do you mean?..
[15:35:52] <agsel> I want to show a confirmation dialog, with yes/no
[15:36:08] <wilornel> $('#id').on('click
[15:36:13] <itatitat> wilornel: my code is here, thanks,  http://jsfiddle.net/BpQsx/
[15:36:17] <agsel> I want to have a function confirm("are you sure?" which would return true/false
[15:36:37] <shoky> TrentonDAdams: works fine for me in mac
[15:36:40] <shoky> TrentonDAdams: chrome
[15:36:45] <wilornel> $('#id').on('click', function(){ confirm("are you sure?"); });
[15:36:51] <wilornel> wasnt that hard huh?...
[15:37:07] <shoky> TrentonDAdams: ummm are you really .replaceWith()ing with that encoded html?
[15:37:25] <TrentonDAdams> shoky: no.
[15:37:36] <agsel> let's me say that again: I want to have a function myconfirm('are you sure?'); which would return true/false depending on the button clicked
[15:37:44] <TrentonDAdams> shoky: I'm just giving the jquery "page" to the replaceWith().  That's just an example to do the same thing.
[15:37:45] <agsel> so the myconfirm has to wait until something is clicked
[15:38:24] <wilornel> yes...
[15:38:26] <TrentonDAdams> shoky: Sorry, jquery ajax page I mean.  As in success:function (page, status, jqXHR)
[15:38:43] <wilornel> the user can click yes or no
[15:38:53] <agsel> my own style confirmation
[15:38:58] <wilornel> second
[15:39:02] <agsel> may-be 4 buttons
[15:39:16] <agsel> and I want to return true only if a certain button is clicked
[15:39:33] <TrentonDAdams> shoky: I'll wait for my co-worker to look at that js fiddle.  Maybe it's a specific mac issue.
[15:39:34] <wilornel> http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-confirmation
[15:39:36] <itatitat> ey how can I avoid that some function after calling fb api jumpt to another function instead of waiting to have all the data?
[15:40:14] <wilornel> itatitat you still didnt send me your code...
[15:40:21] <itatitat> usually I used success, or similar, but with fb.api...
[15:40:34] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/BpQsx/
[15:40:35] <itatitat> thanks
[15:40:40] <shoky> TrentonDAdams: ok, well im running this: http://jsfiddle.net/yDC2M/1/
[15:40:45] <agsel> wilornel: so, I will have :
[15:40:45] <agsel> function myconfirmation(message) {
[15:40:45] <agsel> ....
[15:40:45] <agsel> return true;
[15:40:45] <agsel> }
[15:40:47] <shoky> TrentonDAdams: added the decodeURIComponent
[15:40:54] <agsel> what to put there
[15:41:01] <agsel> I don't want to use jqueryUI stuff
[15:41:03] <agsel> nor any other
[15:41:07] <agsel> I have my own thing
[15:41:14] <wilornel> explain your own thing please
[15:41:17] <agsel> I just need to wait for the user's click
[15:41:24] <wilornel> because there is no other wait to customize the dialog box
[15:41:26] <TrentonDAdams> shoky: okay, and is that breaking?
[15:41:26] <agsel> it is a confirmation dialog :)
[15:41:32] <wilornel> yes/no dialog?
[15:41:39] <agsel> something like that
[15:41:45] <wilornel> explain
[15:41:49] <agsel> but I need to get true/false from that dialog
[15:41:54] <wilornel> okay
[15:41:56] <wilornel> thats possible
[15:41:56] <shoky> TrentonDAdams: nope works fine, elements show
[15:42:00] <wilornel> there are only two buttons
[15:42:13] <agsel> two buttons yes
[15:42:21] <wilornel> there:
[15:42:26] <TrentonDAdams> shoky: Okay, I hope it breaks on my co-worker's computer, cause otherwise I'm confused, lol.
[15:42:30] <wilornel> if(confirm("are you sure?"){ // do something }
[15:42:33] <wilornel> as simple as that
[15:42:35] <ajpiano> agsel: whether or not you use jquery ui's or your own or someone elses, you can't "return" the result of it into the calling function... it's asynchronous
[15:42:47] <ajpiano> the only way to block and wait for confirmation is with native window.confirm
[15:42:48] <wilornel> ajpiano...
[15:43:04] <wilornel> if(confirm("are you sure?")){ // do something } , there you go
[15:43:08] <ajpiano> agsel: if you are going to use a custom not native solution, you have to continuation pass
[15:43:10] <wilornel> you return the result
[15:43:24] <ajpiano> wilornel: anything besides window.confirm doesn't work that way
[15:43:45] <wilornel> thats waht javascript provides
[15:43:50] <wilornel> what are you talking aabout?
[15:43:52] <wilornel> jqueryui?
[15:44:10] <ajpiano> i'm talking about his custom diaog thing he wants
[15:44:26] <wilornel> yeah
[15:44:30] <wilornel> only possible with jqueryui
[15:44:43] <ajpiano> it's not "only" possible with jquery ui
[15:44:53] <wilornel> well its the easiest way..
[15:44:53] <ajpiano> a completely custom solution can do it too if he feels like it
[15:45:24] <wilornel> how?
[15:45:25] <ajpiano> i'm just saying that he can't use anything besdies window.confirm in the same way that window.confirm works, because it blocks and everything else you have to use a callback
[15:45:45] <NackNick> is there a way to check when when you are scrolling you are at a certain div?
[15:45:47] <agsel> what I really want is that I have different js functions I want to call:
[15:45:47] <agsel> myfunction1(); myfunction2(); myfunction3();
[15:45:47] <agsel> and now let's say myfunc2 is a confirmation. if the user clicks "no", I don't want func3 to be executed. therefore, return false would be nice
[15:46:04] <ajpiano> agsel: that's what i mean about continuation passing
[15:46:04] <NackNick> im trying to make a sticky sidebar detect when it is at multiple divs
[15:46:20] <wilornel> its totally possible with the method im proposing...
[15:46:24] <ajpiano> you should pass the functions into each other and conditonally executing
[15:46:58] <agsel> ajpiano: thanks, I was afraid that something like that has to be done
[15:47:04] <agsel> just wanted to confirm it
[15:47:06] <wilornel> what?
[15:47:09] <agsel> confirm, get it :)
[15:47:11] <wilornel> you dont like my method?
[15:47:29] <ajpiano> wilornel: a function that wraps window.confirm isn't the same thing as window.confirm. he doesn't want to use that.
[15:47:31] <agsel> wilornel: your method is nice, but not for me
[15:47:41] <ajpiano> i mean *is* the same thing as window.confirm :p
[15:48:11] <itatitat> ey what about my problem?, I dont know how to solve this
[15:48:46] <wilornel> I still didnt get your code...
[15:49:09] <agsel> wilornel: I can rephrase like that. let's say my "confirmation" is that I have to drag one item from one box to another. depending on whether the user dropped it into the right box or not, my method has to return true/false
[15:49:36] <agsel> I somehow wanted to wait for the action to be completed
[15:49:51] <wilornel> so you're using jqueryui
[15:49:56] <agsel> but yes, I understood that I have to call my func3 inside the callback
[15:50:13] <agsel> I can use jqueryui yes, if needed
[15:50:15] <ajpiano> agsel: but now you understand that the only way to do that is to pass the next step, i.e.., the continuation, into the function so it can invoke it at the proper time
[15:50:35] <agsel> yes, I got that. but wilornel doesn't get what's the problem :)
[15:50:38] <ajpiano> wilornel: this plugin does a similar thing http://trentrichardson.com/Impromptu/
[15:50:46] <wilornel> I still didnt get it..
[15:50:47] <ajpiano> agsel: haha yeah i had a feeling we were on the same page :)
[15:50:54] <crash1hd> hey all I have the following jQuery method $('img.caption').wrap(function(){return '<span class="' + $(this).attr("class") + '">'+$(this).attr("alt")+'</span>';}); works great except that it adds the text in the alt tag before and not after the image
[15:51:03] <shoky> itatitat: i didnt understand your issue
[15:51:16] <ajpiano> wilornel: jquery ui is just a specific implementation of a custom dialog box. ANY custom dialog box where you have to wait for user input has the same limitations, however, and that is what we are discussing
[15:51:31] <wilornel> so you dont want limitations?
[15:51:36] <agsel> :)
[15:51:38] <coldhead> it's the just the way i smile, you said
[15:51:40] <wilornel> what?...
[15:51:44] <wilornel> what?...
[15:51:53] <wilornel> so the user gets a question
[15:51:58] <wilornel> and he has to answer true or false
[15:52:05] <wilornel> and you want him to be able to cancel it
[15:52:06] <wilornel> ?
[15:52:10] <itatitat> ou sorry, Im using fb api, the facebook sdk, the problem is that fb.api is asynchronous, so I need to add a callback, but really I use callbacks to wait to get all the data, but even with that my code doesn't wait and jumps to the next lines, in this case I have errors
[15:52:14] <agsel> may-be the user has to write
[15:52:20] <agsel> let's say I ask, how much is 2+2
[15:52:20] <wilornel> okay...
[15:52:28] <wilornel> 4
[15:52:32] <agsel> and now depending on the result, if it's correct, I want to return true
[15:52:36] <agsel> yes, it's 4 :P
[15:52:36] <wilornel> okay..
[15:52:40] <wilornel> so what now?
[15:52:48] <agsel> that's it
[15:52:50] <wilornel> you can do that with what javascript provides at the start
[15:52:57] <wilornel> its just checking the result
[15:52:58] <shoky> itatitat: what do you mean, your code jumps..?
[15:53:10] <wilornel> var string = somefunc("some question");
[15:53:10] <agsel> but can I have it in one function?
[15:53:16] <wilornel> yes. give me a sec
[15:53:27] <itatitat> yes sorry, jumps = "doesn wait the execution of ajax", continue
[15:53:57] <ajpiano> wilornel: he *doesn't want to use the native window.confirm, prompt, etc*
[15:53:58] <shoky> itatitat:  in your fiddle  there is a function build_menu_friends()  but it is not being called from anywhere
[15:54:03] <wilornel> why not?
[15:54:11] <ajpiano> because he doesn't want to, it doesn't matter why
[15:54:16] <wilornel> what ??
[15:54:30] <shoky> itatitat: jumps from where to where......? your comments in the code dont make senese.. code doesnt just randomly jump
[15:54:49] <itatitat> ok, in my fiddle no, really I call it at first, in my code, the execution should be from top to bottom, function by function, instead of that you can see the firebug output
[15:55:02] <agsel> drag-and-drop example is better
[15:55:06] <ajpiano> agsel: am i correct that you are just asking, philosophically, how to approach your problem, and now you have that understanding?
[15:55:06] <itatitat> ouch.........ok, Im going to improve it, sorry, now I tell you
[15:55:30] <wilornel> I am just trying to understand.. why not use prompt?
[15:55:42] <agsel> ajpiano: yes, I got it
[15:55:44] <ajpiano> because you want custom theming for instance
[15:55:49] <wilornel> oh
[15:55:58] <ajpiano> or you have a completely different interaction that isn't related to prompt or confirm
[15:56:12] <agsel> fade in for example
[15:56:14] <wilornel> okay so its a custom dialog
[15:56:17] <ajpiano> agsel: great :)
[15:56:22] <agsel> wilornel: yes
[15:56:24] <agsel> :)
[15:56:31] <wilornel> okay so what was the answer?
[15:56:55] <agsel> cannot do that
[15:57:01] <agsel> at least not that way
[15:57:09] <itatitat> ok, now is better
[15:57:09] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/BpQsx/1/
[15:57:10] <crash1hd> Is there any way to add text to the end of the element using wrap?
[15:57:20] <agsel> I have to call my other functions inside callback
[15:57:30] <ajpiano> the answer is that he has to pass callbacks along, conditionally invoking them, rather than "returning" and using the return value of one function to block the next one
[15:58:13] <itatitat> now can you se the code better?
[15:58:14] <wilornel> and I thought I was understanding jquery ....
[15:58:38] <wilornel> you guys seem so strange, this task can be accomplished so easily....
[15:58:55] <crash1hd> http://jsfiddle.net/ <-- how do I add the text to the end of the image not before? :)
[15:59:34] <coldhead> wanna save your fiddle and paste the new url crash1hd?
[16:00:04] <crash1hd> coldhead, lol doh yes of course http://jsfiddle.net/YrQY3/
[16:01:55] <shoky> itatitat: i still don't understand
[16:02:25] <shoky> itatitat:  the callback that you give that FB.api  is called when the ajax responds?
[16:02:46] <itatitat> yes..........as usual no?
[16:03:21] <shoky> itatitat: yes.. i dont understand whats NOT usual..
[16:03:26] <crash1hd> coldhead, I am sure I could do this with an each but I thought there might be an easier way using the wrap but I cant seem to find a way to add the text after the image and not before
[16:03:42] <itatitat> ok, in ajax calls, you pass the callback when the transmision is complete
[16:03:54] <shoky> yes
[16:03:55] <itatitat> or rather, the callback is executed when you have all the data
[16:04:00] <shoky> yea
[16:04:34] <shoky> ohhh
[16:04:40] <shoky> i see now, i think
[16:04:44] <itatitat> the problem is that in fb api, Im using a callback, is like the classic ajax, but my problem is that fb api is not waiting to execute the callback, instead of that, the execution continue with the next line
[16:05:10] <itatitat> in this case I've a problem because I havent completed the data transmision, and the next lines arise failures
[16:05:12] <shoky> itatitat: you're doing:   FB.api(..., function(response){ ...});   build_menu_friends()
[16:05:23] <shoky> so build_menu_friends() is called, BEFORE the FB callback is called
[16:05:25] <shoky> of course.
[16:05:29] <shoky> is that the issue?
[16:05:35] <eugene42> Hi all
[16:05:51] <itatitat> ...................
[16:05:57] <itatitat> what line?
[16:05:59] <itatitat> I dont see that
[16:06:15] <shoky> itatitat:   get_list_friends();     build_menu_friends();
[16:06:16] <shoky> right?
[16:06:36] <shoky> and all get_list_friends() does is call FB.api
[16:06:41] <itatitat> but those call are inside the callback no??
[16:06:51] <shoky> a different one..
[16:07:02] <shoky> that's the callback for getLoginStatus...
[16:07:10] <itatitat> ajam...
[16:07:19] <shoky> wat
[16:07:23] <itatitat> really is very confuse for me, can you explain me this?
[16:08:12] <shoky> FB.getloginstatus -> [ajax-request] -> first callback is called -> it calls get_list_friends -> which makes ANOTHER ajax request FB.api(...)
[16:08:25] <shoky> now, before that NEW request has responded
[16:08:29] <itatitat> ajam
[16:08:31] <shoky> the code already "jumps" to the next line
[16:08:36] <shoky> which is:  build_menu_friends();
[16:08:38] <shoky> as usual.
[16:08:55] <shoky> you probably want to put the call to build_menu_friends()  inside the FB.api callback
[16:09:08] <eugene42> If I'm returning a JSON object from php, how can I turn this into a table?
[16:09:15] <itatitat> but why the second function doesnt wait the execution?
[16:09:24] <crash1hd> coldhead,Nevermind I figured it out :)
[16:09:30] <itatitat> I mean, get_list_friends
[16:09:40] <itatitat> why doesn wait its execution?
[16:09:43] <shoky> itatitat:  because javascript doesnt wait. only the callback is what gets called LATERT
[16:09:47] <itatitat> because that function has another callback
[16:09:50] <shoky> itatitat: but you didnt put it in the callback
[16:10:34] <shoky> itatitat:  http://jsfiddle.net/BpQsx/3/
[16:10:53] <shoky> just moved the call to build_menu_friends()
[16:11:00] <coldhead> non-trivial, crash1hd, this is the closest i can get http://jsfiddle.net/YrQY3/1/
[16:11:02] <shoky> to the place where you actually want it to happen
[16:11:52] <crash1hd> coldhead, thanks for trying this is what I came up with http://jsfiddle.net/YrQY3/
[16:11:53] <itatitat> jummmmmmmmmmmm curious, so only continue working the last callback?
[16:11:56] <itatitat> something like that?
[16:11:57] <itatitat> is that?
[16:12:42] <shoky> itatitat: donno what youre saying
[16:13:03] <coldhead> crash1hd: that might be better but you still need to use a fn with wrap so you can access $(this)
[16:13:24] <crash1hd> coldhead, right :) thanks
[16:13:33] <coldhead> and if you need an each() to find the text to pass to "after" it's not that different to mine
[16:13:54] <shoky> itatitat: and now simpler, without that "save" step:  http://jsfiddle.net/BpQsx/5/
[16:13:56] <coldhead> never really noticed before that jquery is kind of a bully about text nodes
[16:14:21] <itatitat> oh man thank, really I want to understand this
[16:15:19] <itatitat> ok, I like
[16:15:35] <itatitat> but in this case?, pasting link
[16:17:09] <itatitat> http://jsfiddle.net/BpQsx/6/
[16:17:36] <shoky> itatitat: no good...
[16:17:52] <itatitat> my question is why the second callback doesnt wait....
[16:17:58] <shoky> itatitat:  whatever you want to happen AFTER the ajax responds, you need to put in the callback.
[16:18:27] <itatitat> aaaaaaaah....................ok.................................
[16:18:34] <shoky> if you want something to happen AFTER the FB.api(..) ajax-request, then you need to put it in the FB.api callback
[16:18:56] <shoky> in your last fiddle the FB.api callback is empty ;)
[16:19:01] <itatitat> ok.......there's no way of wait from antoher callback to continue calling functions, is that no?
[16:19:23] <shoky> itatitat: the whole point of the callback is that it lets you wait..
[16:19:33] <shoky> itatitat: use the callbacks :)
[16:19:38] <itatitat> okok, thanks
[16:19:50] <itatitat> now I've something to fight it
[16:19:52] <itatitat> thanks a lot
[16:19:55] <itatitat> very helpful
[16:19:58] <shoky> np
[16:23:37] <crash1hd> coldhead, more like this http://jsfiddle.net/YrQY3/4/
[16:29:59] <crash1hd> whats better .removeClass() or .removeAttr('class') removeClass removes the contents inside the class but removeAttr removes the class member completly? thoughts?
[16:34:02] <MobCat> removeclass is faster use that instead
[16:34:19] <MobCat> crash1hd
[16:34:23] <coldhead> red is faster
[16:34:38] <MobCat> http://jsperf.com/removeclass-vs-removeattribute
[16:34:43] <crash1hd> ok thanks
[16:34:46] <MobCat> crash1hd: run test for yourself in browsers you wanna use
[16:36:01] <eugene42> how can I turn a json object into a table?
[16:36:40] <coldhead> depends on the object
[16:37:13] <metal_fan> iterate over that object
[16:37:32] <metal_fan> then append key => value pair to some array
[16:37:41] <eugene42> I'm using a simplexml object in php and encoding it over
[16:37:56] <metal_fan> that's even better
[16:38:06] <eugene42> then trying to iterate it over with a .each
[16:38:11] <eugene42> but i keep getting undefined
[16:38:35] <metal_fan> then make sure the property or method exists before you iterate over this one
[16:38:56] <metal_fan> it keeps you from getting undefined
[16:39:24] <metal_fan> OR EVEN BETTER: Ask this question on StackOverFlow.com
[16:40:08] <metal_fan> oh yeah, JSON MUST BE in UTF-8
[16:40:17] <MobCat> utf-8 master race
[16:41:03] <metal_fan> when you pass it to json_encode() and json_decode() (array or string  respectively
[16:41:30] <metal_fan> so make sure you're saving your stuff as UTF-8 Without BOM
[16:41:48] <metal_fan> or you'll get crap
[16:42:50] <eugene42> crap like Ã¢â‚¬â€¹
[16:42:51] <goddard> i have some info that is loaded with ajax and i have a class selector at the top of the page but it looks like it isn't finding the link after it gets reloaded
[16:43:00] <goddard> it works perfect before the reload call
[16:43:40] <metal_fan> this is not actually crap, but multi byte sequence. it's just FINE
[16:43:56] <metal_fan> because it reads the way it shoud
[16:44:27] <metal_fan> Did you event.preventDefault() before?
[16:44:41] <metal_fan> after selector right in callback?
[16:44:55] <goddard> yes
[16:45:06] <goddard> it works perfectly before the ajax call to reload some of the links
[16:45:35] <metal_fan> what about console? Did you get some errors?
[16:46:12] <metal_fan> or tried :   $(window).error = function(e) {  alert(e);  } right after $(function(){}) //global ready event
[16:47:02] <goddard> metal_fan: nope no errors just loads the herf from the <a> tag which is #
[16:48:25] <metal_fan> Do you use Low-level Ajax ($.ajax()) or shorthands ($.post)?
[16:48:27] <goddard> if i move the jquery code to both the pages it works fine
[16:48:58] <goddard> I use ($.ajax
[16:50:15] <metal_fan> well, then (to make a bit clear) setup some params in $.ajaxSetup()
[16:50:46] <metal_fan> like, type, url, beforeSend, complete, charset
[16:51:00] <metal_fan> then
[16:51:40] <metal_fan> just alert respond (even if works fine) right after success: function(respond){ alert(respond);  }
[16:52:03] <metal_fan> 100% you'll notice kind of error
[16:53:20] <metal_fan> try this you have nothing to lose
[17:04:59] <MistuhKurtz> I'm having a little z-index issue. If you roll your mouse over the thumbnails from left to right, everything works great. If you roll your mouse over the thumbnails from right to left, it doesn't look quite as nice
[17:05:12] <MistuhKurtz> http://jsfiddle.net/kvcrawford/4NTKB/
[17:05:46] <MistuhKurtz> it's because given a same z-index value and everything else equal, the next sibling element will be rendered as having a higher z-index
[17:06:03] <oxfouzer> MistuhKurtz: works perfectly
[17:06:26] <MistuhKurtz> I could make the z-index a var outside of the scope of my hover function, and increment it on each hover, so everytime an element is hovered over it will have a higher z-index than everything else
[17:06:37] <MistuhKurtz> but that's not very elegant
[17:07:24] <MistuhKurtz> yeah oxfouzer I'm just being picky :P if you hover over a thumbnail, I want it to immediately be given the highest z-index
[17:07:54] <MistuhKurtz> which is the case when your mouse moves from left to right, but if you move from right to left you'll see what i mean.
[17:07:55] <oxfouzer> oh well
[17:08:09] <oxfouzer> i get it
[17:08:12] <oxfouzer> it has a little flicker
[17:08:22] <MistuhKurtz> the item that's shrinking will have a higher z-index until it shrinks back down to normal when the z-index is reset to auto in a callback
[17:08:49] <MistuhKurtz> just curious if anybody could conceive of a different approach (besides my incrementing z-index var)
[17:42:55] <hashpuppy> anyone know of a date slider for jquery?
[17:53:55] <initself> cust_num: $(this).data('cust_num')  cust_num contains a leading zero
[17:54:03] <initself> how can i prevent it from stripping the leading zero?
[17:56:59] <initself> attr() doesn't strip but that just seems lame
[17:57:26] <MistuhKurtz> initself, are you trying to store the value as an int or a string?
[17:57:49] <MistuhKurtz> $(el).data('num', 02); or $(el).data('num', '02');
[17:58:02] <initself> string
[17:58:12] <MistuhKurtz> the second way?
[17:58:18] <initself> well, it's already in 'cust_num'
[17:58:19] <MistuhKurtz> I don't know why the leading 0 would be getting stripped then...
[17:58:29] <initself> i think data does conversion
[17:58:38] <initself> i'll just go with what's working for now
[17:58:44] <MistuhKurtz> initself, does it get stored as a string or an int? because that's the important part
[17:59:34] <initself> i dont really know how to answer your question
[17:59:53] <initself> the data attribute is sitting there in data-cust_num="014543"
[18:00:09] <initself> using .data('cust_num') strips the zero
[18:01:36] <MistuhKurtz> I didn't realize data() stored the values in data-* attributes
[18:04:18] <initself> it retrieves it
[18:04:50] <ktom49> is there a good way to see if a Twitter Bootstrap modal window is open?
[18:05:59] <MistuhKurtz> initself, found your same exact question :P http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10983854/jquery-data-type-conversion-issue
[18:06:56] <MistuhKurtz> initself, thsi might also work: data-num="'0123'"
[18:07:00] <MistuhKurtz> there are single quotes inside the double quotes
[18:51:46] <ed4208> What is anyones thoughts on the best solution to include a menu bar on multiple pages?  I'm using the one html file approach.  Right now, I'm trying something to the effect of $(document).bind('pageinit', function() {  $('.MENU-CONTAINER').load("template/MENU_FILE.html"); });
[18:52:12] <ed4208> I should mention this is specifically for query mobile
[18:58:33] <kborchers> ed4208: can you not use something like http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/toolbars/footer-persist-a.html
[19:01:21] <ed4208> kborchers: I was looking at that earlier today.  It sounds good, but it doesn't really address the fact that I'll still need to manually insert the same header/footer html content within each page.  My site has about 25 pages, so it adds a lot of extra code.  I'd like to see a solution that uses one element that persists across all pages.  Aside from being more simple to maintain, for sites with many pages it could significantly reduce the
[19:01:22] <ed4208> DOM.  I'm thinking more in a back-end approach, where I can list an external HTML file and just include it at least?
[19:03:44] <kborchers> ed4208: are you actually switching pages or is jQuery Mobile doing its standard ajax nav stuff?
[19:04:35] <ed4208> I'm not actually switching pages, it's just the query mobile ajax nav approach.  All of the content is in one html file.
[19:06:37] <robert_> so I'm trying to get every child of a <root> object using jQuery 1.8.2, but it only ever seems to want to give me the <root> object or nothing. what gives? so far, I'm trying to use theDoc.children("root > *") to select the children, but I get nothing. :/ What gives?
[19:38:32] <raj> everyone asleep?
[19:38:50] <Guest21584> yaaaawns
[19:39:54] <raj> what's the way to get widget information about an element for jqui?
[19:40:09] <raj> so I can examine the object in console
[19:40:16] <raj> properties
[19:41:55] <raj> hmm, where are ajpianisimo, colhead, Evaltwin and Corck when you need them!
[19:43:44] <Jak_o_Shadows> Could i have a little help with http://jsfiddle.net/NqfMX/8/ ? Trying to change the content part
[19:47:13] <defaultro> join #multiman
[19:47:30] <defaultro> sorry folks
[19:58:16] <raj> could really use some help before I hop on this 20hr flight to india!
[20:01:15] <coldhead> i don't know shit about widgets
[20:01:30] <raj> such a lie
[20:02:35] <coldhead> honestly
[20:02:41] <coldhead> UI gives me a rash

[20:05:30] <raj> cool, looking forward to it :)
[20:06:28] <MacWinner> if I have three input checkboxes with name="lists[]" and each has the same id, what's the best way to select out the entire lists[] array?
[20:06:52] <Guest21584> "each has the same id" is a no go ...
[20:07:00] <coldhead> IDs must be unique
[20:07:13] <MacWinner> ahh.. ok.. different id's then.. how do you get lists[]?
[20:07:51] <MacWinner> id="id1" name="lists[]"  â€¦ id="id2" name="lists[]"   â€¦ id="id3" name="lists[]"    etc...
[20:08:21] <coldhead> you want the values? $('[name=^lists']).map(function () { return $(this).val(); });
[20:08:27] <coldhead> er
[20:08:43] <coldhead> $('[name=^lists]').map(function () { return $(this).val(); });
[20:08:46] <MacWinner> yeah.. values..
[20:08:55] <coldhead> that should return an array of the values
[20:09:20] <MacWinner> holy crap.. it would have taken me a long time to figure that out.. thanks!  i'll read up on that search query.. i'm totally new to jquery
[20:09:25] <MacWinner> just can do basics
[20:09:52] <coldhead> ?map @ MacWinner
[20:09:53] <bot-t> MacWinner, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[20:12:03] <MacWinner> coldhead, sorry.. got this javascript error:  Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [name=^lists]
[20:12:09] <coldhead> ah try
[20:12:18] <coldhead> [name^="lists"]
[20:12:20] <coldhead> i typoed
[20:12:30] <coldhead> me so sorry
[20:14:01] <Zuchto> what is the terminology used for talking about something like a div that is used to cover another div to make the underlaying one not clickable or to show some kind of spinner on it?
[20:14:16] <jrockjiggz> z-index
[20:14:55] <jrockjiggz> invisible div
[20:15:00] <raj> overlying div
[20:15:03] <raj> overlay
[20:18:51] <Zuchto> ok, thanks
[20:20:13] <MacWinner> coldhead, thank you.. almost got it.. how do I also select the checkboxes where checked="true"?
[20:21:02] <MacWinner> coldhead, this is my line btw:    var lists = $('[name^="lists"]').map(function () {return this.value;}).get();
[20:21:42] <coldhead> $('[name^="lists"]:checked').map(function () {return this.value;}).get();
[20:21:48] <coldhead> ?:checked @ MacWinner
[20:21:49] <bot-t> MacWinner, :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[20:22:57] <MacWinner> thanks! works perfect! much appreciated
[20:23:54] <b0ss_> how is JSON used to exchange data between two apps ?
[20:25:36] <coldhead> ?w osi model @ b0ss_
[20:25:39] <bot-t> b0ss_, OSI model - The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model (ISO/IEC 7498-1) is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection effort at the International Organization for Standardization. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model
[20:26:14] <raj> b0ss_, what do you mean "two apps"?
[20:29:22] <b0ss_> raj: a real world example of aplication of JSON ?
[20:29:45] <tw2113> b0ss_, twitter api
[20:30:10] <coldhead> sometimes i write shopping lists on my hand in JSON
[20:30:14] <coldhead> that's pretty "real"
[20:30:30] <grafi> oÃ´
[20:30:51] <grafi> nominated for a geek-oscar right there coldhead
[20:31:22] <coldhead> [{"item": "Budget Bacon Grease", "size": "Large", "quantity": 4}]
[20:32:16] <grafi> ^^
[20:32:57] <grafi> thats kind of like writing xml for fun
[20:33:02] <grafi> if you ask me ^^
[20:33:45] <coldhead> it looks nicer handwritten than XML though, because {} is prettier than <>
[20:33:52] <b0ss_> coldhead: is that an array of on element ?
[20:34:02] <coldhead> it is, b0ss_
[20:34:10] <grafi> well only if you can write a good {
[20:34:20] <coldhead> because a shopping list typically has one or more elements
[20:34:21] <grafi> in my experience i tend to ruin those
[20:34:29] <coldhead> they take practice, no doubt
[20:34:35] <b0ss_> coldhead: can you give an overview of the usage of that array in your app, please ?
[20:34:46] <coldhead> the app is my brain
[20:34:51] <tw2113> b0ss_, are you aware of the concept of key/value pairs?
[20:34:55] <grafi> of course you would be an expert in writing them doing shopping lists and sh*t by hand ^^
[20:34:57] <coldhead> i look at what i wrote on my hand when i am shopping
[20:35:09] <coldhead> to remember to get bacon grease
[20:35:20] <grafi> pretty neat interface you got there
[20:35:21] <b0ss_> tw2113: yes, I am.
[20:35:21] <coldhead> are we doing your homework, b0ss_ ?
[20:35:27] <grafi> its like magic
[20:35:41] <b0ss_> no homework at all!
[20:35:59] <coldhead> you phrase your questions like homework
[20:36:08] <coldhead> you may wish to consider a career as a teacher
[20:36:09] <grafi> hes a teacher <:
[20:36:21] <coldhead> {:
[20:36:28] <b0ss_> coldhead: thanks ... ?
[20:36:31] <grafi> get out of my brain
[20:36:36] <coldhead> hey any time
[20:36:38] <tw2113> b0ss_, json is based on key/value
[20:37:09] <b0ss_> ok, key/value... what else ?
[20:37:35] <coldhead> arrays, strings and numbers
[20:38:27] <grafi> do you also use indentation when writing a shopping list on your hand?
[20:38:33] <grafi> and how much spaces has a tab :o
[20:38:55] <coldhead> it depends on how much i am buying
[20:39:17] <grafi> so its not standardized
[20:40:44] <coldhead> no, my brain is a flexible API
[20:41:04] <coldhead> it doesn't even need to balid JSON
[20:41:08] <grafi> if feel like there should be a style guideline so that other are able to easily read & understand what is written on your hand :P
[20:41:10] <coldhead> be valid*
[20:41:15] <coldhead> validish is sufficient
[20:41:20] <maxmahem> hay could someone maybe point out where I'm going wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/ZL5qF/1/
[20:41:55] <grafi> its awesome how you are able to manage faulty input like that
[20:41:59] <tw2113> helps to tell what you're trying to do maxmahem
[20:42:04] <grafi> like i said: magic
[20:42:36] <maxmahem> tw2113, I'd like to insert a p w/ the data after the user clicks the a.extractLink link
[20:43:10] <coldhead> i get a Fatal Error on the href in your <a> maxmahem
[20:43:22] <coldhead> there is an &amp; that should be a &
[20:43:41] <coldhead> and if the server sends a 500 for a fatal error then the .get() will fail
[20:43:42] <maxmahem> ah derp. I corrected that in my code, didn't update the fiddle.
[20:43:54] <coldhead> okay so that's not the issue
[20:44:26] <raj> b0ss_, I mean what applications are you trying to communicate?
[20:44:34] <raj> are they both frontend?
[20:44:42] <raj> if so, do they communicate via your server?
[20:46:02] <newperson206> Hi there, I'm working on a ruby on rails web app and I'm having some trouble with something that should be otherwise easy. I'm trying to append a new list item to a <ul> above it, but I can't seem to get it to function properly. Can someone take a look at this piratepad and give me some pointers? http://piratepad.net/Y3jdEyNuSP
[20:46:18] <coldhead> maxmahem: http://jsfiddle.net/ZL5qF/3/
[20:46:27] <newperson206> I should point out that I'm rather new and the jQuery is giving me more trouble than I expected it to
[20:46:41] <coldhead> the `this` in the get() doesn't refer to the <a> like it does outside the get()
[20:46:48] <coldhead> you have to save it to another var and use that
[20:47:31] <shesek> newperson206, .hide().slideDown();
[20:47:43] <shesek> tho it doesn't make much sense to slide an invisible element
[20:47:46] <shesek> what are you trying to do?
[20:48:13] <coldhead> &x, &y, &printf;
[20:48:15] <newperson206> well, at this point I've sort of been throwing anything I can find at it
[20:48:27] <newperson206> you're right, the hide() makes no sense
[20:48:50] <shesek> besides, you're taking an element that's already in #testing... and add back to #testing?
[20:48:56] <shesek> what are you trying to achieve?
[20:48:59] <newperson206> sorry, I should've been more clear
[20:49:22] <newperson206> I have a form and I want it to append the new <li> to the <ul> that its attached to
[20:49:36] <shesek> where does the new li come from?
[20:49:59] <newperson206> the form posts it (albeit to a different controller)
[20:50:02] <shesek> you want an empty <li>? a specific new <li> from somewhere? a new <li> with some text?
[20:50:19] <newperson206> the <li> contains the contents of a Post's message
[20:50:40] <shesek> as part of the document's HTML?
[20:50:44] <shesek> * of the
[20:51:07] <newperson206> I'm not sure I understand the question, I apologize
[20:51:16] <junnel1001> Hello Good day
[20:51:31] <junnel1001> I have some questions regarding Basic Authentication in jquery ajax
[20:51:47] <newperson206> So I'm hoping that the <li> would append to the <ul> and display without a page refresh required
[20:51:59] <newperson206> the <li> is being created through form submission
[20:52:44] <maxmahem> coldhead, ah that worked like a charm. Thanks.
[20:52:53] <shesek> newperson206, the <li> is being created? are you sure about that?
[20:53:13] <newperson206> positive, I went ahead and did a binding.pry and confirmed that it is being created and properly assigned an id
[20:53:14] <shesek> don't you mean the form submission creates some new data in a database, and you want to create an <li> yourself with the new data?
[20:53:33] <newperson206> I suppose that's what I mean, thank you for your patience shesek
[20:54:04] <newperson206> I'm sure that it is being created in the database, and now I'd like it to display on the appropriate <ul> without a page refresh
[20:54:05] <shesek> do you have the text that should be in the new <li> somewhere?
[20:54:25] <shesek> you're gonna need to create your own <li>, fill it with some text, and add it
[20:54:46] <shesek> you can do it via $('<li>').text(your_contents_here).appendTo('#testing')
[20:55:04] <shesek> the contents should either be echoed back from the server, or read directly from the form the user filled-in
[20:55:37] <shesek> how are you submitting the form? ajax?
[20:56:10] <newperson206> so at this point, I've set the form to remote => true
[20:56:21] <newperson206> and I've made a .js.erb for that action
[20:56:39] <newperson206> and now I'm trying to sort the actual jQuery stuff that I should put in there
[20:56:52] <newperson206> so I guess, long answer... yes? using Ajax
[20:57:30] <erdos> hey yall
[20:58:38] <erdos> if i want to make an accordion, but i don't want the anything like you do with the theme roller, do you think it's worth integrating jqui or would it just be quicker to write a little jquery snippet?
[20:59:22] <newperson206> shesek I think I know what I need to do. I think I need to make each one of these list items a partial
[20:59:48] <shesek> you could do that, and than return the HTML for the new element from the server
[20:59:53] <newperson206> and then instead of rendering each item on the #show page with a normal loop, I'll just render each partial somehow
[21:00:04] <newperson206> yeah that sounds like what I'll try
[21:00:08] <newperson206> I appreciate your help
[21:00:16] <shesek> you welcome
[21:00:42] <newperson206> although I am a little bit confused as to why _something_ isn't happening
[21:00:57] <newperson206> when I submit the form, even without the <li> being properly made, shouldn't it at least be trying to insert something into the <ul> ?
[21:01:23] <shesek> newperson206, well, you're taking an <li> that's already inside the <ul>, and re-add it there
[21:01:45] <shesek> I'd expect it to move to the bottom of the <ul>
[21:01:53] <shesek> if its already last, you aren't going to see anything
[21:02:06] <newperson206> oh, okay
[21:02:17] <shesek> either that, or there's something else wrong, like the selectors being wrong or elements it should find are missing
[21:02:39] <shesek> but assuming the elements are there and the selectors are correct, that's what I assumed happens
[21:02:41] <newperson206> I'm feeling pretty confident on the selectors, I think it must be the other thing you mentioned
[21:03:06] <newperson206> i'm finding that trying to fix/debug jQuery stuff is a lot more challenging than other rails issues
[21:03:46] <newperson206> well, once again I appreciate your help shesek. I'm going to go ahead and try to implement this fix. thanks!
[21:04:05] <shesek> newperson206, have you looked around the various javascript debugging tools?
[21:04:09] <newperson206> hmm
[21:04:14] <newperson206> I have just been using the Chrome tools
[21:04:18] <shesek> like Firebug for firefox or Chrome's web developer tools?
[21:04:30] <shesek> ah, than it should be rather easy to debug than
[21:04:45] <newperson206> I suppose I'm just new to it and thats giving me trouble
[21:04:54] <shesek> add a break point in your appendTo() line, and check what elements are returned from the selectors
[21:05:52] <newperson206> yeah its definitely grabbing them correctly, it must be the other issue
[21:06:26] <newperson206> I'm going to dig into this stuff. thanks again shesek!
[21:07:07] <zubelgenubi> Anyone know if I can do a split listview in jqm with no link on the left side?
[21:08:46] <zubelgenubi> currently I have to add links to '#' to make it work, but I don't want the left side to be links.
[21:09:42] <araneae> I'm having a bit of an issue. http://dana.theorourkes.us/solar/ is the app I'm working with. I'm attempting to get the line $('#sol').bind('click', $.proxy(sol,'stateUp')); in game.js to be a part of the init for the star class, but I just can't seem to push it into a manner where my variables are within scope. Been at this for days, now. -.-
[21:12:09] <shesek> araneae, you should probably store them on your game object
[21:12:45] <shesek> but you'll have to wait until after the game is initiated to run the initialization code of the solar system
[21:13:47] <araneae> 	//$('#'+this.name).bind('click', $.proxy(this.name,'stateUp')); is my aborted try at that. :P
[21:14:04] <shesek> what variables are you trying to access?
[21:14:33] <araneae> I was trying to access the name of the instance of the star class and pass it to call that class again for the $.proxy call
[21:15:40] <shesek> araneae, why access the name than?
[21:16:12] <shesek> you just want to call the stateUp method when that button is clicked?
[21:16:14] <araneae> I can't think of a better way to do it.
[21:16:26] <shesek> just $.proxy(this, 'startUp')
[21:16:33] <shesek> why take the name?
[21:17:01] <araneae> It's possibly because I've overcomplicated it. :P
[21:17:12] <shesek> when you're using $.proxy in $(document).ready() you're doing it well, why is it any different there?
[21:22:42] <raj> hmmm...still not here =T
[21:24:24] <coldhead> probably waiting for you to leave
[21:24:45] <raj> lmao
[21:24:46] <raj> prolly
[21:25:16] <dawra> resizing is not constricted from the bottom edge http://jqueryui.com/resizable/#constrain-area is that a dam bug?
[21:42:58] <roldy1988> anyone good with jquery
[21:43:08] <roldy1988> :)
[21:44:37] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[21:45:01] <wroathe> Is there a way to change the context of a callback passed into append?
[21:46:08] <wroathe> roldy1988: Ask your question
[21:46:26] <coldhead> ?proxy @ wroathe
[21:46:27] <bot-t> wroathe, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[21:46:54] <wroathe> coldhead: Awesome.
[21:47:20] <roldy1988> i have very limited knowledge of jquery. im making a NFL power rankings, i want to make a drop & drag list with an input for each of the 32 teams. where can i find a premade one or a good tutorial for making this, as well as calling it with a submit button?
[21:47:21] <coldhead> their example even uses append() <3
[21:48:16] <b0ss_> I can't print the 'name' in this code http://pastebin.com/whQV8RDc why ?
[21:48:42] <coldhead> it's an object, b0ss_
[21:48:46] <coldhead> $myUser->name
[21:49:35] <wroathe> coldhead: Wow. That's exactly what I was looking for.
[21:49:49] <wroathe> It's time to dig into the jQuery internals, I need to know what devilry makes black magic like that happen!
[21:50:00] <coldhead> yeah that's an interesting one
[21:50:42] <coldhead> return fn.apply( context || this, args.concat( core_slice.call( arguments ) ) );
[21:52:47] <roldy1988> anyone?
[21:58:06] <araneae> Thank you, shesek. It's still not fixed, but you've given me something to think about. I'll sleep on it and see if I can't move forward with the insight you've given me.
[22:02:45] <coldhead> roldy1988: did you look at this demo? http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists
[22:02:50] <coldhead> not much code
[22:04:47] <roldy1988> coldhead: i did, I got that to work, but how do I name each of the <li>, and how do I call it when submit is pressed
[22:09:44] <coldhead> something like this roldy1988 http://jsfiddle.net/sLZp8/
[22:14:14] * coldhead np: lac amnis - sparkspitter
[22:30:00] <coldhead> you are welcome
[22:32:03] * tw2113 heard a rumor that today is actually coldhead's 2nd day
[22:32:05] <roldy1988> lol sorry, was working on it, cant get the button to alert. thanks for the help. and btw, im an atlanta fan :p
[22:32:40] <coldhead> the button was working when i gave it to you!
[22:32:52] <roldy1988> i know, its working on the link, just not on my page :S
[22:33:08] <coldhead> is the sorty stuff working on your page?
[22:33:14] <roldy1988> yeh, all that works
[22:33:34] <coldhead> weird
[22:33:54] <roldy1988> i know, im probably gonna sleep and work on it in the morning. im sleepy anywa.s thanks for the help!
[22:34:08] <coldhead> have fun roldy1988
[22:34:16] <coldhead> i will never forget the time we spent together
[22:42:04] <tw2113> coldhead, after a split() what would be a good way to select the 2nd index, in a chained command
[22:42:30] <tw2113> .split('-')[1] ?
[22:42:54] <tw2113> that seems to have worked
[22:48:07] <coldhead> yah that's what i'd do
[22:48:15] <coldhead> except consider
[22:48:27] <coldhead> ?eval 'this is fail'.split('-')[1]
[22:48:30] <bot-t> coldhead: undefined
[22:49:17] <tw2113> what i'm selecting will always have a - in it, thankfully
[22:50:17] <coldhead> it's only really a problem if you try to do like
[22:50:24] <coldhead> ?eval 'this is fail'.split('-')[1].toLowerCase();
[22:50:25] <bot-t> coldhead: TypeError: "this is fail".split("-")[1] is undefined
[22:57:11] <roldy1988> coldhead, i made the button a div and added $(function() { and it works on my site
[22:57:15] <roldy1988> just a fyi
[22:57:44] <roldy1988> thanks for the help, night.
[22:59:34] <coldhead> great work buddy

[23:31:04] <oojacoboo> anyone have a clue why when I log serialize() for a form, I see what I expect, but when it's being sent, the value of a select changes and is always sending the value of the first option?
