[00:00:07] <chjj> maybe
[00:00:11] <devians> all good in theory, but most of us have clients that have ie requirements :P
[00:00:14] <chjj> i dont care though, i wont ever forgive them
[00:00:18] <Superstar> How do I use a dynamic object id for the target property in ajax forms? http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#options-object
[00:00:21] <chjj> yeah i know
[00:00:28] <austen> It seems that Microsoft doesn't really have to do much to ensure their market share... People are going to use IE because it comes with Windows and they don't have to install anything "manually" they can just let "automatic updates" take care of them.
[00:00:31] <chjj> im just saying, you should be more spiteful toward ie
[00:00:38] <chjj> even if you have to support it
[00:01:06] <austen> I was in a big heated depate earlier about IE.;
[00:01:15] <chjj> this "ie is okay now" attitude bugs me, as if everyone has forgotten the millions of hours web developers have poured into fixing this browser, wasting them, when they couldve been spent elsewhere
[00:01:19] <austen> I don't like IE9, I don't think it's that much of an improvement.
[00:01:48] <chjj> honestly, could anything redeem them?
[00:01:49] <Superstar> I've gotten this far but it just doesn't obtain the object id for the target property yet it does with the test object named 'container' : http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/666267/
[00:01:49] <austen> I expect a major release of a browser to have some marked support increases in CSS, which IE continuously fails to deliver.
[00:01:52] <chjj> i dont think so
[00:02:17] <austen> Haven't even seen a lick of ie10
[00:02:28] <chjj> i think you can download a preview or something
[00:02:49] <austen> Well.. I'm a linux guy, so I need to run everything in VM...
[00:02:59] <chjj> same
[00:03:01] <chjj> i mean
[00:03:05] <austen> I have Win7 running in VM, but it is sloooow.
[00:03:08] <chjj> opera, ff, chrome i can run fine
[00:03:14] <chjj> i need to start a vm for safari and ie
[00:03:35] <chjj> i cannot get safari to work in a vm for the life of me
[00:03:36] <austen> Is the "fishbowl" test total shit?
[00:03:40] <chjj> even in windows it crashes
[00:03:44] <chjj> its a terrible browser
[00:03:49] <chjj> i mean
[00:03:51] <austen> It seems so "constructed" of a performance test
[00:03:55] <chjj> i cant get safari to work in wine*
[00:04:02] <chjj> have to use a vm
[00:04:10] <madprops> can i do something like this? $(id).html(html).delay(800).html('');
[00:04:29] <austen> I have a mac, my linux desktop and a windows laptop (running xp).
[00:04:42] <austen> I use VirtualBox for win7 on my linux desktop.
[00:05:12] <chjj> i think i dislike osx, and apple in general, more than i dislike windows
[00:05:20] <Bower^> chjj, I just think it's crazy that web developers need to jump through all these hoops to accommodate for the various browsers. all browsers should be interpreting some very well defined standard so we don't waste time on this.
[00:05:30] <austen> delay() sets the delay of execution on the fx queue. It really only works for animations...
[00:05:44] <austen> madprops ^^^
[00:05:57] <chjj> Bower^: i think ideally, everyone would agree
[00:06:06] <eml> chjj: The windows version of safari is terrible, yes. It's not a terrible browser on OSX though
[00:06:30] <chjj> ive never tried it on osx, every time i run it in windows or debian/wine, it crashes
[00:06:33] <chjj> every time
[00:06:44] <innociv> the each doesn't even seem to be making the erorr
[00:07:16] <austen> Honestly, I think OSX is way better than Windows... But then again, I jumped the Windows ship a long time ago. I've been UNIX since the mid 2000's exclusively.
[00:07:35] <chjj> as far as im convinced, safari is ie8 with a better rendering engine
[00:07:42] <Bower^> I would be a linux man but damn, I love my games
[00:07:43] <austen> I haven't seen or heard of a Windows release that has made me question my decision to abandon that ship.;
[00:07:47] <Bower^> Windows has that shit cornered
[00:08:05] <eml> Honestly, I think it's up to each one and these discussions never lead to anything
[00:08:15] <chjj> ive been a linux guy for a while, but i always have a windows installation on my disk, "just in case"
[00:08:28] <austen> Yeah, but that makes sense though... Linux/Unix is like 1% of the market. :)
[00:08:33] <devians> eml: you mean we wont decide it finally, here and now?! crazyness :P
[00:08:33] <eml> Instead of argumenting we can think of a good solution for me to order an array of objects by the objects start_date property
[00:08:53] <chjj> its hard to liberate yourself from windows when its marketshare is so commanding
[00:09:11] <chjj> its why i still set aside 100gb for a windows install
[00:09:23] <austen> I did. I haven't relied on Windows in years.
[00:09:28] <fotoflo> chjj: I'm able to get by pretty well with macOS
[00:09:30] <devians> i only have a vm for windows, which i run one app on, very rarely.
[00:09:45] <austen> I propose a Global Boycott Internet Explorer Day.
[00:09:50] <fotoflo> i have to use windows occasionally because my office uses systems that only work with IE6, but other then that mac is fine
[00:09:58] <chjj> honestly, ive never had to use it, but its there
[00:10:08] <chjj> but i still need a windows vm for safari and ie, like i said
[00:10:11] <austen> Detect IE and BLOCK it from viewing your website. Instead direct them to a site which explains why IE is horrible and shouldn't be used...
[00:10:14] <fotoflo> austen: why just one day? why not install another one
[00:10:21] <fotoflo> global install other browser day
[00:10:25] <austen> That's what I'm saying!
[00:10:35] <chjj> i propose a global boycott ie century
[00:10:36] <austen> But that's hard to achieve.
[00:10:37] <fotoflo> do it across the web
[00:10:49] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/svgpu/ That commented line is for some reason making an error on jquery each.
[00:10:53] <austen> A one-day "media awareness" event is more achievable, I think...
[00:10:56] <chjj> or better yet, and entire boycott apple & microsoft day
[00:10:59] <chjj> an*
[00:11:00] <fotoflo> if google and Facebook teamed up, ibet they could pull it off
[00:11:13] <chjj> i hope google wins out of the 3 top dogs
[00:11:27] <austen> My only problem with Apple is their exclusivity and expense.
[00:11:30] <devians> heh, cos google is doing so well...
[00:11:30] <chjj> to be honest, theyre a lot more respectable than either apple or microsoft could ever be
[00:11:32] <innociv> I have no idea what ot look at.
[00:11:37] <innociv> To figure out why the hell tihs is happening in firefox.
[00:11:42] <devians> google is too two faced for me tbh
[00:11:46] <austen> Apple makes nice products though. They really think that shit through.
[00:12:10] <chjj> google has contributed a ton to the web, some *very* thankless things that no one acknowledges either
[00:12:22] <chjj> and they do them, even though they get no credit
[00:12:28] <Bower^> I do like google
[00:12:32] <devians> when you use google products, its not the product being sold, you are. just saying
[00:12:41] <devians> plus the whole OPEN (not really) thing
[00:13:08] <Bower^> they make cool shit, i don't really care it's all fuelled by a desire for advertising money
[00:13:15] <chjj> yeah, the paperthin view of google as an evil megacorporation gets old pretty fast, dont tire me out please
[00:13:22] <austen> Well, any version of "open" is better than Microsoft.
[00:13:34] <chjj> austen: thats not what microsoft says
[00:13:38] <austen> And I'm fine with being the product.
[00:13:47] <chjj> its true, i read it on the ms blog
[00:14:07] <chjj> they were like "wtf, webm is so patent encumbered, mp4 is so superior, btw we need more money"
[00:14:09] <devians> chjj: im just saying google says stuff and does something else. apple at least has the decency to continue being predictably tyrranical :P
[00:14:14] <austen> It's old news. We've been the product of advertisers and television since the turn of the century (radio speaking, of course)
[00:14:30] <innociv> Ha.. I figured it out
[00:14:43] <austen> Whell GASP AND SWOON!!! If Microsoft says it ain't so then it must not be!
[00:14:48] <chjj> apple... have you not been paying attention to the whole html5 video controversy?
[00:15:03] <austen> I read a Microsoft webpage saying that IE 6 was 100% CSS1 compliant! LOL
[00:15:08] <chjj> i would love it if youtube dropped h264 support, google has the upperhand there
[00:15:12] <chjj> apple products would be ruined
[00:15:20] <chjj> i would laugh so hard
[00:15:26] <innociv> Firefox is throwing an error if the object is empty
[00:15:31] <innociv> The object jsut wasnt' empty in chrome..
[00:15:34] <austen> It'll happen. h264 is about to start charging a lot of money in royalties.
[00:15:42] <austen> The new WebM is going to roll out soon
[00:16:09] <austen> It already has, but it will be picked up soon, I mean. Especially when Youtube makes it the default codec
[00:16:10] <chjj> i hope it does, i really hope google just drops h264 *completely*, all apple product users would end up gravitating toward something less douchebaggy
[00:16:18] <chjj> and apple would be ruined for being so childish
[00:16:22] <chjj> and not implementing webm
[00:16:29] <chjj> same with microsoft
[00:16:29] <devians> .... yes, thats exactly what would happen
[00:16:31] <devians> lel
[00:16:36] <chjj> apple and microsoft can go make love for all i care
[00:16:58] <fotoflo> hmm, how do i make a box with jquery-ui that looks like a dialogue widget, but is actually just a static box
[00:17:07] <austen> AFAIK WebM will be supported by most browsers within the next major release of the browsers.
[00:17:12] <chjj> as for the web, im most comfortable with it in google's hands, theyre the only ones who have shown that they care about more than money, at least a little bit
[00:17:14] <austen> Including IE
[00:18:31] <austen> But man... I have a 1999 Mac G4 AGP Pro... Still kicking it. Can't say a PC from 1999 would have held up so long...
[00:18:38] <austen> That's saying something!
[00:18:51] <Bower^> I was watching Crockford's lectures on Javascript and he made a good point. All this innovation and new releases is good but meh, what's it worth when we can't use it because there's still a lot of old browsers that won't support it
[00:19:23] <chjj> if you allow yourself to be enslaved by legacy browsers, i dont think you should call yourself a web developer
[00:19:34] <austen> Bower^ that's alwasy going to be the case. Transiston is slow no matter what.
[00:19:34] <chjj> =/
[00:19:35] <innociv> Is [] the same as false, or no?
[00:19:45] <austen> Browsers that adapt survive, those that don't, dont.
[00:19:46] <devians> chjj: do you actually ever... get paid? heh
[00:20:02] <sam350> innociv have you ever heard of the console
[00:20:04] <austen> innociv: no. [] != false.
[00:20:11] <sam350> you could test that question so much faster than asking it
[00:20:23] <chjj> haha, i dont usually do frontend work for money, probably why i have such abnormal strong opinions on the subject
[00:20:24] <austen> [].length == 0
[00:20:40] <innociv> yeah you're right. I could have if( [] ) in console.
[00:20:46] <sam350> :)
[00:20:58] <sam350> does this channel have the eval bot that #javascript does
[00:22:31] <chjj> sam350: i think it does
[00:22:49] <sam350> do u know what the command is
[00:22:50] <chjj> not sure, not exactly a regular here
[00:22:51] <austen> Anyway... I hate IE, all versions. Don't care what improvements 9 has made over 8 or 10 makes over 9... They all fall horribly short in my eyes...
[00:22:55] <chjj> ?eval test
[00:22:56] <bot-t> chjj: ReferenceError: test is not defined
[00:23:02] <chjj> thats it
[00:23:03] <sam350> ?eval 1+1
[00:23:04] <bot-t> sam350: 2
[00:23:07] <sam350> lovely
[00:23:22] <sam350> ?eval []==true
[00:23:23] <bot-t> sam350: false
[00:23:27] <chjj> austen: i completely agree, i wish that attitude was more common
[00:23:58] <chjj> the best browser in the world cant redeem them for what theyve done
[00:24:03] <austen> I was arguing with a guy who said "All web developers talk shit about IE" and then lamented that we were being the "victim"
[00:24:11] <chjj> hehe
[00:24:20] <sam350> I cant understand for the life of me why IE doesnt use webkit
[00:24:29] <sam350> and then add all their active x shit
[00:24:34] <austen> He not being a web developer. I just said, if all web developers talk shit about IE, don't you think there might be something to that, given web development is thier business?
[00:24:38] <sam350> at least use the base which is open source
[00:24:51] <chjj> im half and half on that idea, part of me would respect them if they bit the bullet and used webkit
[00:25:01] <austen> I think that Microsoft has no incentive to improve IE.
[00:25:02] <chjj> but the other part of me thinks webkit is too popular
[00:25:05] <austen> Or fix it.
[00:25:23] <sam350> isnt that the idea.. to be popular and not have differences
[00:25:25] <austen> It just re-enforces thier user base reliance on their proprietary technology
[00:25:38] <chjj> sam350: yeah, i was expecting that response, youre right
[00:25:42] <sam350> hehe
[00:25:45] <chjj> im not sure why i feel that way
[00:26:03] <SoulRaven>  is it posibile to change the default text -webkit-validation-bubble-message using js or something?
[00:26:05] <innociv> trying to $.each undefined turned out to be my problem.  I was just looking in the wrong places.
[00:26:05] <austen> Nah, I think whatever is really well supported, who cares about "popularity"
[00:26:08] <chjj> i guess im kind of resistent to monopolies, i mean, thats what microsoft is isnt it?
[00:26:28] <sam350> i think chrome and ff are slower than they used to be, where hogging system resources concerned
[00:26:29] <austen> As long as the shit works like I expect it to work and is efficient at doing what it is supposed to do...
[00:26:39] <austen> Chrome is webkit, yes?
[00:26:43] <sam350> yep makes sense chjj
[00:26:48] <austen> Chrome has spoiled me...
[00:26:50] <sam350> austen chrome uses webkit
[00:26:55] <chjj> i havent noticed any difference with chrome, ff has gone down the gutter though
[00:26:56] <sam350> it is the underlying engine
[00:27:10] <austen> I love the development tools in chrome.
[00:27:13] <chjj> the creative lead and project director for ff resigned after ff4 i think
[00:27:15] <austen> So fucking nice!
[00:27:18] <Bower^> I really like chrome but I get a weird timeout bug on my favourite forum
[00:27:20] <Bower^> Really lame
[00:27:23] <chjj> after FF started to copy chrome
[00:27:26] <chjj> oh well
[00:27:36] <chjj> at least we have chrome, the only browser worth using now
[00:27:46] <fotoflo> how can i make it so a draggable([grid: [x,y]]) jquery-ui widget switches places with the widget it lands on
[00:27:49] <sam350> thats the thing man theres a lot of wierd stuff happening when they keep releasing new version so often
[00:27:57] <sam350> has turned me off of web development
[00:28:04] <chjj> well they copied chromes release cycle
[00:28:07] <SoulRaven> any ideea if is posibile to change the default text -webkit-validation-bubble-message using js or something?
[00:28:08] <SoulRaven> ?
[00:28:20] <chjj> IE and FF have both been trying to replicate the chrome ui for a while now
[00:28:23] <SoulRaven> i am searching on net for several days, but nothing
[00:28:37] <sam350> soulraven why u wanna do dat
[00:28:49] <chjj> i actually think that the fact that IE's tabs on the same bar as the address bar was an attempt at one-upping chrome's minimalism by microsoft
[00:28:53] <chjj> rather pathetic attempt
[00:29:05] <SoulRaven> i wan to personalise the messages and trigger when i want
[00:29:06] <chjj> and blatant, shameless, attempt
[00:29:11] <fotoflo> chjj: when chrome came out everyone said "oh, thats how you do it!" but they didn't want to make an actual copy and be accused of … copying
[00:29:12] <VictorBjelkholm> can I combine this-selector with other selectors?
[00:29:29] <chjj> well tehy failed at the last part
[00:29:35] <Bower^> lol chjj that's the first thing I noticed when I opened it for the first time
[00:29:46] <austen> I just love how IE doesn't let you cancel the loading of the default Microsoft website. It loads it no matter what. :) lol
[00:29:53] <Bower^> hahaha
[00:30:04] <Cork> ?.add @ VictorBjelkholm
[00:30:05] <bot-t> VictorBjelkholm, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[00:30:08] <chjj> every time i open ie, i feel dirty
[00:30:18] <chjj> literally dirty, like i need to give my computer a shower
[00:30:21] <austen> Every time I boot windows I feel dirty...
[00:30:21] <VictorBjelkholm> codepal, bot-t, thanks!
[00:30:30] <SoulRaven> sam350: any ideea?
[00:30:32] <austen> Even when it is in a window inside Ubuntu...
[00:30:42] <austen> I feel like I'm dishonoring Linus
[00:30:46] <chjj> i feel dirty on ubuntu too ;p
[00:30:56] <chjj> you cant dishonor THE MAN
[00:31:05] <chjj> __THE MAN__
[00:31:06] <chjj> ;p
[00:31:14] <austen> I love Debian... Used to be solely Debian, but I got sick of configuring EVERYTHING!
[00:31:22] <chjj> i kind of like it
[00:31:22] <VictorBjelkholm> Cork, that wasn't really what I was looking for
[00:31:30] <chjj> im all for configuring things by hand
[00:31:41] <chjj> makes everything seem cleaner
[00:31:54] <Cork> VictorBjelkholm: $('selector').add(this) ?
[00:32:11] <austen> Cleaner? Nah... Understood... Clear... But not necessarily cleaner. :)
[00:32:12] <VictorBjelkholm> I don't want to add something, I want to select something
[00:32:25] <Cork> VictorBjelkholm: thats what it does
[00:32:38] <chjj> i think im just insecure about it, maybe i would call it precise instead
[00:32:50] <chjj> using a gui to configure things always feels unprecise to me
[00:32:57] <austen> VictorBjelkholm: do you mean $(selector1).$(selector2)?
[00:33:04] <VictorBjelkholm> austen, like that, yes
[00:33:04] <austen> You can do that with .filter()
[00:33:16] <austen> $(selector).filter(selector2)
[00:33:35] <austen> $(selector).find(selector2)
[00:34:14] <VictorBjelkholm> wait, I'm gonna make an example
[00:34:30] <austen> ...of that rat bastard!!
[00:34:40] <austen> You go right ahead! Get your popcorn, guys!
[00:35:20] <austen> I just wanted to hear some IE shit talk... I need refueling after my argument...
[00:35:48] <chjj> anyway, anyone want to test my app framework for me?

[00:39:55] <austen> VictorBjelkholm (Sweedish??) What am I looking at??
[00:40:13] <VictorBjelkholm> austen, the markup are in english atleast :D
[00:40:54] <austen> :)
[00:41:05] <austen> Not what I was referring to...
[00:41:29] <austen> I'm part Sweedish (Borgen, father's mother's side)
[00:41:38] <VictorBjelkholm> oh, vad roligt
[00:41:53] <austen> Dutch (Hoogenboezen) father's father's side
[00:41:56] <fotoflo> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#display-grid
[00:42:02] <fotoflo> can I make a div sortable?
[00:42:04] <VictorBjelkholm> austen, the rest of you is from?
[00:42:21] <austen> I'm German, Sweedish and Dutch
[00:42:29] <VictorBjelkholm> nice combination
[00:42:43] <VictorBjelkholm> forlong, you just linked to a site where there is a lot of sortable divs
[00:42:43] <austen> The Langs, Borgens and Hoogenboezens
[00:42:52] <austen> And Meyers
[00:43:10] <austen> But that's why I'm 50% german and only 25% sweedish/dutch
[00:43:12] <fotoflo> VictorBjelkholm: they are <li>'s
[00:43:41] <xec> austen: "swedish" is with one E, fyi ;)
[00:43:46] <VictorBjelkholm> forlong, that's right
[00:43:48] <VictorBjelkholm> "To arrange sortable items as a grid, give them identical dimensions and float them using CSS."
[00:43:52] <VictorBjelkholm> try that
[00:43:55] <austen> VictorBjelkolm: I'm just not sure what I'm looking at.
[00:44:05] <VictorBjelkholm> austen, that's normal html?
[00:44:19] <sam350> chjj I watched it and will look at this week
[00:44:21] <austen> xec: I've had more than 12 beers so far... Not going to compete in the spelling B
[00:44:23] <VictorBjelkholm> except the action-attribute
[00:45:30] <chjj> sam350: thank you sir, its kind of unstable at the moment, but its been a private project of mine for a while, and i plan to keep working on it
[00:45:40] <xec> austen: oh. you need more beers i guess
[00:45:52] <austen> Victor: Yes, I understand the markup, but what is your question with it?
[00:46:03] <austen> xec: I went and bought 12 more. :)
[00:46:09] <austen> Working on that now!
[00:46:11] <xec> :D
[00:46:45] <austen> xec: but I'm 1,800 miles from the 10 gallons I brewed last May...
[00:47:04] <VictorBjelkholm> austen. when I click someone of the links in class="votes", I want to select class="number"
[00:47:07] <austen> I have a Pilsner and a Belgium Wit that I'm dying to try...
[00:47:26] <VictorBjelkholm> I have come this far: $('.votes a').click(function(){});
[00:47:42] <fotoflo> VictorBjelkholm: hmrmm, did that and its not working
[00:47:53] <VictorBjelkholm> the class="singleThread" appears many times
[00:48:51] <austen> Victor: try this: $('#1').click('function()...
[00:49:11] <fotoflo> hmmr, it appears to be partially working
[00:49:17] <VictorBjelkholm> the id isn't the same all the time
[00:49:30] <VictorBjelkholm> the id depends on what row the database returns
[00:49:33] <austen> If you want the href to select a specific number, all you have to do is select the specific number object by reference.
[00:49:51] <VictorBjelkholm> no the number changes also
[00:50:04] <VictorBjelkholm> I wan't to select the .number in the current .singleThread
[00:50:17] <VictorBjelkholm> m,wan't,want
[00:50:25] <austen> You don't have to adhere to standards either. I often add attributes to my code for selectability purposes. You can have <div class "number" selectable="byMySpecialLink">
[00:50:35] <VictorBjelkholm> yeye
[00:50:57] <austen> then you can select "number" by $('[selectable=byMySpecialLink]')
[00:51:21] <VictorBjelkholm> but there will be many selectable=byMySpecialLink
[00:51:41] <VictorBjelkholm> I want to select only one of them, the one in the current .singleThread
[00:51:52] <VictorBjelkholm> that's why I need to use the this-keyword somehow
[00:51:54] <VictorBjelkholm> I think atleast...
[00:51:56] <austen> As far as coding goes, each page of results *can* be unique.
[00:52:20] <austen> You can insert whatever ID you want to select by per page, regardless of how the data changes.
[00:52:36] <austen> Just use a simple incrementing ID for a unique tag name that you select.
[00:52:43] <xec> VictorBjelkholm: im just jumping in here, but maybe what you want is to search using $(this).filter() or $(this).find()
[00:53:09] <austen> You won't have the same tag value each time the page loads, perhaps, but for selecting purposes it will get the job done.
[00:53:25] <austen> xec: mentioned that. :)
[00:53:26] <VictorBjelkholm> $(this) refers to the current link I'm clicking so that wont work... I must travel back then select the .number
[00:53:37] <xec> .closest() ?
[00:53:45] <VictorBjelkholm> that might work
[00:53:52] <austen> $(this) only refers to the last selector referenced from within a callback function...
[00:54:32] <VictorBjelkholm> xec, didn't work
[00:54:42] <austen> Does $('a > b') or $('a > div') work?
[00:54:46] <Bower^> If I done $.getJSON(url, {params}, function(data){return data}), where does data go to?
[00:54:49] <xec> did you have a url
[00:54:50] <austen> No, probably wouldnt...
[00:55:16] <austen> Victor: do you have control over the output?
[00:55:28] <VictorBjelkholm> yes
[00:55:55] <austen> Can you insert an attribute into the <a href> that corresponds to the <number> you want to select?
[00:56:08] <eml> Damnit, I have a bunch of memory leaks it seems :-(
[00:56:25] <VictorBjelkholm> yes but that isn't the solution I'm looking for
[00:56:30] <VictorBjelkholm> I'm looking for jQuery solution :)
[00:57:37] <austen> If so, you can do $('a').click(function(){ $('.number[attribName='+$(this).attrib('attribName')+']');
[00:58:29] <austen> eml: I made Chrome crahs tonight...
[00:58:50] <austen> I was trying to support IE, which forced me to use horribly inefficient javascript....
[00:58:51] <VictorBjelkholm> I should be able to do something like: $(this).parent().next('.numbers').html(threadId+action);
[00:59:00] <xec> VictorBjelkholm: http://jsfiddle.net/AHmyq/
[00:59:00] <VictorBjelkholm> but it just don't work
[00:59:21] <xec> what exactly are you trying to do
[01:00:06] <VictorBjelkholm> xec, that works!
[01:00:07] <VictorBjelkholm> thanks :)
[01:00:38] <VictorBjelkholm> the threadId+action is just some debug-code
[01:00:52] <VictorBjelkholm> real-time voting is my current challenge
[01:02:34] <xec> VictorBjelkholm: well, you might have two users voting at the same time right? the cleanest solution is to send your vote information (id and up or down) to the server with ajax and let the server return the number
[01:02:51] <VictorBjelkholm> xec, exactly what I'm doing
[01:02:58] <VictorBjelkholm> didn't share the whole code with you :)
[01:03:07] <VictorBjelkholm> ajax+jQuery
[01:03:19] <xec> you wouldn't need to select the (position of) number till after you get the reply from server
[01:03:58] <austen> VictorBjelkholm: and just fyi: you're only allowed unique id elements per page, having multiple elements with the same ID value breaks WC3
[01:04:27] <VictorBjelkholm> yep, so does custom attributes
[01:04:35] <VictorBjelkholm> but thanks for the headsup
[01:04:51] <xec> but multiple id's breaks your ability to select by id's
[01:05:09] <Bower^> http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=artist.gettopalbums&mbid=bf2e15d0-4b77-469e-bfb4-f8414415baca&api_key=b25b959554ed76058ac220b7b2e0a026&format=json&callback=test - How could I get the value of @attr.artist? When I try print it using jsonObj.@attr.artist I get an error saying it cannot convert it to a string
[01:05:51] <xec> VictorBjelkholm: html5 actually includes custom attributes, just prepend with "data-"
[01:05:57] <VictorBjelkholm> xec, I'm not going to select them by id so that doesn't matter
[01:06:03] <VictorBjelkholm> xec, really? That's nice
[01:06:12] <xec> http://html5doctor.com/html5-custom-data-attributes/
[01:07:10] <Bower^> That's pretty sweet
[01:07:30] <xec> VictorBjelkholm: can be accessed through jquery with .data()
[01:07:47] <austen> I already do custom attributes. :)
[01:08:02] <VictorBjelkholm> that's one feature I have missed
[01:08:06] <VictorBjelkholm> thanks for the tip
[01:08:08] <austen> It just breaks standards, but browsers ignore what they don't understand...
[01:08:21] <VictorBjelkholm> not html5 if I understand correctly?
[01:08:26] <xec> right
[01:09:15] <austen> <a href="" howIsTheGameGoing="good" really="wellNotReally" whyIsThat="becauseItIsThePatriots" oh="nufSaid">neat</a>
[01:09:18] <Bower^> Anyone? Getting an attribute value of an element stored in JSON format? :)
[01:09:24] <xec> the thing with not following the standard is, your custom attribute might actually mean something in a later version of html
[01:09:43] <Cork> Bower^: you can't store an element as json
[01:09:51] <Bower^> Well
[01:09:57] <Bower^> The API has included the info somehow
[01:10:07] <austen> xec: yeah, sure.
[01:10:07] <twoface> always prefix your own attributes with 'data-'
[01:10:10] <Cork> Bower^: what does the json data look like?
[01:10:12] <austen> Tis true.
[01:10:16] <Bower^> http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=artist.gettopalbums&mbid=bf2e15d0-4b77-469e-bfb4-f8414415baca&api_key=b25b959554ed76058ac220b7b2e0a026&format=json&callback=test
[01:10:19] <Bower^> go towards the end
[01:10:28] <austen> But when is 'howIsTheGameGoing' ever going to be an accepted attribute?
[01:10:29] <austen> :)
[01:10:37] <austen> Gotta plan smartly!
[01:10:40] <Bower^> you'll see "artist" : "Public Enemy"
[01:10:44] <xec> austen: indeed :)
[01:10:45] <Bower^> I want that :)
[01:10:58] <xec> austen: which is why they reserved the "data-" namespace
[01:11:11] <austen> It is a smart thing to do... data-
[01:11:29] <austen> I will adopt it immediately. :)
[01:11:47] <Bower^> It's perfect for what I wanna do soon
[01:12:27] <skar> hi, is there any easing effect where the div/element drops/slides down faster and gets slower as the animation nears the end?
[01:13:49] <Cork> Bower^: obj['@attr']
[01:14:04] <Cork> same level as you can do .name or ['name']
[01:14:07] <xec> Bower^: obj.topalbums['@attr'].artist
[01:14:36] <Bower^> Legends, thank you :)
[01:14:54] <Bower^> Seems I was reading the JSON structure incorrectly
[01:15:16] <Bower^> Is there some tool that would format something like that one liner into something more human-readable
[01:15:55] <cypha> can someone tell me how I can turn the Register page into a jquery popup instead?
[01:15:56] <Bower^> Wait, I guess I can just view the data in XML within the browser to see how it is structured
[01:16:05] <cypha> http://69.84.109.187:6543
[01:16:43] <xec> Bower^: do you use chrome's inspector or firebug or the likes?
[01:17:06] <cypha> any help would be much appreciated
[01:17:16] <siovene> Hi, how can I do .each on a named element? E.g.: var foo = $("<div/>"); foo.each(function() {...});  <-- that doesn't work.
[01:17:17] <Bower^> Yeah I just done console.log(jsonObj)..i need to use FireBug more often :)
[01:17:23] <Bower^> Very new to JS
[01:17:30] <siovene> (suppose there *are* descendant in the foo div.)
[01:18:10] <Bower^> I'm starting to quite like JS and I'm a Java man
[01:18:53] <xec> Bower^: yeah, i'm just learning too, firebug is my hero <3
[01:19:30] <siovene> make
[01:19:34] <siovene> (sorry, wrong window)
[01:20:03] <xec> did you just try to compile #jquery? :D
[01:20:11] <Bower^> :D
[01:20:46] <VictorBjelkholm> cypha, begin making a div that will be your popup
[01:20:59] <VictorBjelkholm> place the html of the register-page in that div
[01:21:03] <VictorBjelkholm> hide the div with css
[01:22:07] <mazzachre> Someone here, who is very good with jquerymobile?
[01:22:36] <Bower^> mazzachre, might be worth checking out #jquerymobile
[01:22:53] <VictorBjelkholm> ask your questions instead of ask if you could ask
[01:24:41] <austen> I had been so enamoured by Chrome that I've forgotten to test my application in firefox... Been testing in IE, Safari  and Opera...
[01:24:52] <austen> Firefos doesn't run my code...
[01:24:55] <austen> ugh
[01:25:09] <austen> No errors, just no results...
[01:27:05] <SoulRaven> any ideea if is posibile to change the default text -webkit-validation-bubble-message using js or something?
[01:27:06] <SoulRaven> ?
[01:27:41] <VictorBjelkholm> SoulRaven, if you could style it with css, shouldn't you be able to change the text then?
[01:28:18] <mazzachre> Bower^: Am doing, but I get more answers in a cemetary
[01:28:25] <VictorBjelkholm> SoulRaven: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5713405/how-do-you-style-the-html5-form-validation-messages
[01:28:26] <Bower^> Hehe
[01:30:27] <SoulRaven> VictorBjelkholm: but i don'know how to personaly the text
[01:31:06] <qwerty57> what's the opposite of onmouseclick ? want to make a simple clickable img with jquery
[01:31:20] <VictorBjelkholm> SoulRaven, that I believe is impossible
[01:31:21] <SoulRaven> ì want to change the default text, and trigger when i want ot bubble message
[01:31:32] <VictorBjelkholm> only Chrome enables you to style it
[01:31:50] <VictorBjelkholm> qwerty57, place <a href=""></a> around the img
[01:32:34] <austen> qwerty57: why do you need the opposite? onmouseup...
[01:32:58] <austen> would be the closest proximity...
[01:33:00] <qwerty57> onclick change to clicked img, onmouseup change bcak
[01:33:02] <qwerty57> :)
[01:33:16] <austen> onmousedown:onmouseup
[01:33:28] <austen> rather: mousedown:mouseup
[01:33:31] <austen> in jquery
[01:34:21] <austen> No sympathy?
[01:34:32] <austen> two weeks I've been developing my app...
[01:34:36] <VictorBjelkholm> sympathy is overrated
[01:34:48] <austen> Having to drop IE because it can't be done in IE (no way, no how)
[01:35:14] <austen> And firefox doesn't even respond with an error or a result of any kind??
[01:35:18] <austen> Sucks...
[01:35:23] <Bower^> I'm still getting my head around the asynchronous nature of some methods. For example the getJSON() method. I wanna do stuff with the data returned but I feel somewhat limited by only being able to do stuff in the callback function. Is it a standard practice to use the callback function to set a boolean flag that functions which use the JSON data can reference in regards to the data actually existing?
[01:35:28] <VictorBjelkholm> oh, you meant the framework sympathy?
[01:35:35] <austen> Gonna have to re-implement my application in Java...
[01:37:01] <austen> I love that exit message: * Xeon06_ has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[01:37:34] <austen> Must be running windows...
[01:38:09] <austen> Okay.... time to go to bed... Almost 2 in the Am here...
[01:38:27] <qwerty57> :(
[01:38:33] <qwerty57> just came to work
[01:38:59] <austen> qwerty57: I really hope it isn't 2am where you are!
[01:39:10] <qwerty57> 09:39 am :D
[01:39:12] <qwerty57> Londonnnn
[01:39:28] <austen> Aah... Has the rioting stopped?
[01:39:52] <mazzachre> Bower^: async is the way to do things... Makes it more responsive. All UI work is done async (even in java)
[01:40:06] <rookmoot> http://pastebin.com/Vm5FJTTV
[01:40:12] <Bower^> I know man but it's a pretty different mindset for me :)
[01:40:14] <rookmoot> is their a way to call the refresh method ?
[01:40:15] <Bower^> At least initially
[01:40:23] <qwerty57> yea, chavs calmed down. i was waching rise of the planet of the apes yesterday, and when the apes where crushing the city it looked exactly as the riots in London
[01:40:28] <qwerty57> watching*
[01:40:49] <rookmoot> qwerty57, hahaha
[01:41:23] <qwerty57> it's funny, people in egypt fighting for new government, people fighting in libya syria for freedom etc, people in england fighting for adidas, nike and TVs
[01:41:25] <mazzachre> Bower^: A few hints though... Make use of a "loading" UI type in response to user click, so they know that something is happening. The main problem with many async UI usages is bad responsiveness... this is much more important in network based UI where latency can be horiffic
[01:41:52] <Bower^> Oh dear, just killed my browser with an infinite loop
[01:42:12] <sam350> Bower: oh snap!
[01:42:22] <Bower^> Alright cheers mazzachre
[01:42:23] <mazzachre> qwerty57: It didn't start out that way... it started when the police gunned down a black guy for being posh (apparently) you had the same thing in US decades back... but enough politics
[01:42:52] <sam350> bower
[01:43:15] <sam350> if you want to feel like you are not having to use a callback method in getJSON or .load or .ajax or .post
[01:43:21] <sam350> then put the callback method inline
[01:43:25] <qwerty57> his death was their excuse. stealing adidas TVs and xbox games because someone got shot?...
[01:43:47] <sam350> so it's $.getJSON('myurl.php', function(){  console.log('hello') })
[01:44:07] <sam350> only dif is that it wont be called until a response or error happens
[01:44:28] <sam350> I dont see how that limits you in any way
[01:44:48] <sam350> if yo uwant to do something right after the getJSON
[01:44:53] <sam350> then wrap it all in a function
[01:45:14] <Bower^> Interesting
[01:45:15] <sam350> called myGetJSONFromSomeAPI()
[01:45:33] <sam350> which calls the getJSON and also some other stuff after it
[01:46:19] <sam350> could even make the myGetJSONFromSomeAPI take a parameter of url if it's something you want to happen everytime getJSON is called
[01:46:45] <Bower^> I'm using a kinda wrapper object for $.getJSON atm
[01:47:09] <sam350> cool.. you do know that getJSON is a wrapper for the ajax method right
[01:47:26] <sam350> does the same thing but does parseJSON with the response immediately
[01:47:56] <austen> mazzchre: decades back?? Seems like just yesterday...
[01:48:01] <Bower^> it would be ideal, in my mind at least, if I could just do something like var jsonObj = $.getJSON(args);
[01:48:08] <Bower^> Can you tell I come from Java? lol
[01:48:38] <Bower^> anything that interacts with jsonObj just checks if its defined
[01:48:42] <Bower^> if it isn't, wait until it is
[01:48:43] <austen> Ok... That's a night for me... Sleepy time!
[01:48:45] <Bower^> I know this is wrong
[01:48:53] <Bower^> I need to get out of this mindset
[01:48:57] <Bower^> night night austen !
[01:49:04] <austen> Downed my beer. Nice, nice pillow!
[01:50:35] <sam350> Bower I hear ya
[01:50:52] <sam350> I am about to do Java full time and forget front end development
[01:51:02] <Bower^> Nice
[01:51:12] <sam350> head is about to 'splode from all the wacky stuff going on
[01:51:16] <yogurt_truck> D:
[01:51:20] <Bower^> I know Java gets a lot of stick but I really like the language
[01:51:23] <sam350> maybe getting too old for it or somethin
[01:51:26] <Bower^> She was my first
[01:51:27] <blackspotwiggins> sam350, i guess it's a matter of perspective
[01:51:28] <qwerty57> how do I do something like $(this).('img').attr......?
[01:51:29] <Bower^> She was gentle
[01:51:30] <qwerty57> on an anchor
[01:51:48] <blackspotwiggins> i think doing BuffredFileReaderStringMagicFactoryFairyInitializer() is wacky
[01:51:49] <sam350> Bower c/c++ was my frist, then .Net c#
[01:52:02] <sam350> then php/lamp
[01:52:08] <sam350> and I missed c#
[01:52:11] <sam350> then I find java
[01:52:18] <sam350> and think it's the best
[01:52:29] <chjj> =( that makes me sad
[01:52:33] <sam350> sorry dude
[01:52:36] * chjj doesnt like java
[01:52:49] <sam350> js and python are great for quick prototyping
[01:52:51] <chjj> ;p
[01:52:52] <yogurt_truck> java is one absolutely horrible language, jesus christ
[01:52:53] <blackspotwiggins> i respect java for what it its, but i dont like it
[01:53:05] <sam350> man if I have to build a library to reuse for long time
[01:53:09] <sam350> Java is great
[01:53:10] <Bower^> yogurt_truck, what's wrong with it? :D
[01:53:12] <blackspotwiggins> i like how someone put it on twitter - java is DSL for converting xml into stack traces :P
[01:53:21] <sam350> when I did 30 windows phone 7 apps last year
[01:53:42] <sam350> I decided I want a nice library that does everything I want and is compiled, statically typed
[01:53:55] <yogurt_truck> Bower^: everything
[01:53:55] <sam350> I can go use that .net c# library I wrote for so much stuff
[01:54:09] <yogurt_truck> some fine software is java-based though
[01:54:24] <yogurt_truck> s/some/a lot/
[01:54:28] <sam350> everything ive written in js and python, and all the libraries I've used of other ppls in js and python and php, all soooo brittle
[01:54:42] <sam350> c# and java stuff is much more solid and testable
[01:54:48] * Bower^ nods 
[01:54:57] <blackspotwiggins> sam350, that's because js doesnt enforce any quality
[01:55:06] <blackspotwiggins> there are tons of plugins/libs that are awful
[01:55:10] <chjj> doesnt mean quality cant be had
[01:55:15] <blackspotwiggins> exactly
[01:55:17] <sam350> im sure
[01:55:28] <yogurt_truck> and java enforces quality?
[01:55:39] <sam350> doesnt force it but I can quickly see what the F is goin on
[01:55:44] <blackspotwiggins> yogurt_truck, the community is so hostile, in a freaky way it does
[01:55:55] <sam350> if someone would make a badass IDE for js
[01:56:00] <sam350> (maybe they have)
[01:56:12] * yogurt_truck doesn't remember any quality-enforcing features in java from his java times
[01:56:12] <chjj> i like js, despite its flaws, i like prototypal inheritence
[01:56:36] <chjj> i dont like IDE's personally
[01:56:46] <blackspotwiggins> yogurt_truck, i meant that you dont really find any noobs doing their libs in java
[01:56:49] <sam350> problem I see is that frontend dev pays just as much or more as java/c# it seems
[01:56:59] <blackspotwiggins> so you get stuff that was made it through
[01:57:02] <sam350> so then I think, why make the change
[01:57:36] <SanityIO> Hi. How do i access query parameter inside .get() callback function ( i am calling .get() inside for loop and i need to rebind "i" inside callback closure)
[01:57:37] <sam350> chjj I am always using textmate and vim, but like using VS and Eclipse too
[01:57:56] <Bower^> I do my html/css/php/js in netbeans
[01:57:56] <chjj> never used those, i use gedit and vim
[01:57:58] <Bower^> Lovely IDE
[01:58:15] <sam350> SanityIO global var?
[01:58:25] <yogurt_truck> i like both IDEs and lightweight editors. but most IDEs have features that are mainly for class-based OO stuff. no goodies for prototypal inheritance, functional programming, etc
[01:58:29] <Bower^> old skool chjj :D
[01:58:38] <SanityIO> sam350, no local.
[01:58:43] <sam350> yogurt: yes so one that has that kinda stuf
[01:58:48] <chjj> haha, im totally not a vim hacker, but it is my terminal editor
[01:58:49] <sam350> is what id like
[01:59:00] <sam350> SanityIO: im suggesting
[01:59:11] <sam350> bc I'm not sure it's available
[01:59:24] <sam350> maybe the entire url, which you could regex for the ? and then split on the &
[01:59:31] <SanityIO> sam350, i am doing for(var i = 0; ... ){ $.get(url, {query_params}, function(){  uses "i" var }   ) }
[01:59:34] <blackspotwiggins> oh god wat
[01:59:51] <chjj> yeah that will lead to problems
[01:59:52] <blackspotwiggins> sam350, that's very java-esque solution :D
[02:00:09] <sam350> blackspotwiggins: what u suggest for him?
[02:00:20] <blackspotwiggins> SanityIO, you already have query params stored somewhere
[02:00:44] <SanityIO> blackspotwiggins, well it must be somewhere.. it is unclear from docs
[02:00:47] <blackspotwiggins> i suggest use a closure loop
[02:00:59] <blackspotwiggins> and store it in a var inside that
[02:01:05] <SanityIO> blackspotwiggins, closure loop? whats is this?
[02:01:11] <sam350> well I must not be that big of a java fanboy.. im not into GWT
[02:01:14] <blackspotwiggins> ?each @ SanityIO
[02:01:16] <bot-t> SanityIO, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[02:01:29] <blackspotwiggins> you can use $.each to iterate over arrays too
[02:01:31] <sam350> ive written 2000 line js webapps and prefer using js and jquery
[02:01:58] <blackspotwiggins> sam350, if you do stuff like regex parsing request url, i can imagine why they are 2000 lines
[02:02:13] <chjj> i think i would rather use c# than java, even though ive never tried it
[02:02:37] <chjj> i was taught java my first year in cs, and made myself forget it all
[02:02:41] <sam350> blackspotwiggins: never needed to know the params inside a .get callback, so was just thinking outloud
[02:03:02] <chjj> i was expecting to learn c, i had to end up teaching myself c
[02:03:19] <yogurt_truck> chjj: i dislike both of them, but i've worked with both and i think c# is light years ahead
[02:03:20] <sam350> chjj I hear ya but if you need to write a large maintainable application I think you might like to use a compiled lang
[02:03:39] <blackspotwiggins> sam350, why is that?
[02:03:42] <sam350> yogurt: I disliked that part of c# all the fancy new stuff
[02:03:47] <blackspotwiggins> compiled offers 0 benefits IMO
[02:03:59] <yogurt_truck> what does being compiled have to do with being more maintainable?
[02:04:03] <sam350> how about compile time checking of eveyrhting the entire app does
[02:04:20] <blackspotwiggins> static code analysis works for noncompiled languages as well
[02:04:21] <Bower^> Something Java is great at
[02:04:25] <sam350> change one thing in one file
[02:04:30] <Bower^> and ideal for new programmers
[02:04:38] <sam350> and it knows if something will break in the other 20 thousand lines
[02:04:42] <SanityIO> blackspotwiggins, .each is kinda hackish for my situation.. i am looping over counter not collection.. and also there is "if" inside for
[02:04:43] <sam350> need I say more
[02:05:17] <chjj> SanityIO; what do you mean?
[02:05:18] <blackspotwiggins> SanityIO, well i assumed from var i = 0.
[02:05:18] <SanityIO> blackspotwiggins, do you know maybe there is a way to set attribute on a callback closure.. like callback.i = i
[02:06:06] <yogurt_truck> sam350: for most apps you can't check _everything_ the "entire app" does at compile time, for starters...
[02:06:23] <blackspotwiggins> yeah, it gives you a false sense of security IMO
[02:06:28] <SanityIO> blackspotwiggins, that was simplified.. in fact for(var i = page; ...){ if( complex expression){ $.get( ... ) } }
[02:06:32] <chjj> SanityIO: i think you might be going about things the wrong way
[02:06:43] <sam350> also I have learned in the hundreds of projects Ive worked on in c#/java and js and python and php that having strict typing makes the code much more readable and understandable
[02:06:46] <blackspotwiggins> and productivity is way better for dynamic languages IMO
[02:07:06] <chjj> if you dont want to use an `each` function, wrap it: for (..) (function() { ... })();
[02:07:08] <sam350> stack tracing and much better debuggers
[02:07:11] <anli__> Is there support for images in options nowadays?
[02:07:30] <blackspotwiggins> sam350, are you suggesting that dynamic languages dont have stack tracing or good debuggers?
[02:07:43] <SanityIO> chjj, jeah.. i all thy this.. thnx
[02:08:03] <sam350> no I just feel like it's clearer with java
[02:08:09] <chjj> arguably, debugging information can be a lot more verbose and easier to implement in higher level languages
[02:08:24] <blackspotwiggins> "arguably" ?
[02:08:29] <blackspotwiggins> have you seen C errors? :P
[02:08:39] <sam350> well are you a C programmer
[02:08:41] <chjj> well compiled languages can be verbose
[02:08:43] <blackspotwiggins> no im not
[02:08:56] <chjj> the information has to be compiled though, thats the catch
[02:09:03] <sam350> well me either at the moment, but if we were, it'd probably be clearer
[02:09:24] <Bower^> C doesn't really do clear :P
[02:09:28] <sam350> hehe
[02:09:29] <chjj> in interpreted in higher level languages you get the luxury of preserving any necessary debugging information =/
[02:09:50] <chjj> i dont see how you could say thats not the case
[02:10:00] <yogurt_truck> where the hell does this idea of compiled == cleaner come from?
[02:10:08] <sam350> clearer
[02:10:09] <blackspotwiggins> i'd like to know as well
[02:10:15] <sam350> because man
[02:10:17] <yogurt_truck> clearer*
[02:10:23] <sam350> List<Person>
[02:10:30] <yogurt_truck> arghh my eyes
[02:10:32] <sam350> haha
[02:10:42] <sam350> what is so bad about that
[02:11:13] <chjj> lol
[02:11:26] <sam350> I do say arghhh my eyes when I step into some methods in java debuggin
[02:11:28] <blackspotwiggins> sam350, i think you were supposed to explain how its "clearer" or "better" than dynamic languages
[02:11:31] <sam350> and it goes on for evvvver
[02:11:50] <yogurt_truck> i did try out groovy the other day
[02:11:53] <yogurt_truck> it was...
[02:11:57] <yogurt_truck> ...interesting
[02:12:10] <sam350> yogurt: go on
[02:12:28] <yogurt_truck> kinda "hey let's make java feel like ruby"
[02:12:41] <sam350> I dont see the point
[02:12:48] <sam350> java is not hard to code
[02:12:49] <anli__> Can jquery synthesize selectboxes?
[02:13:00] <sam350> not THAT verbose
[02:13:00] <anli__> Not all browsers supports backgrounds
[02:13:49] <chjj> lets not make anything feel like ruby please
[02:13:49] <anli__> hm, found one
[02:14:04] <sam350> does anyone know if there's an event that is thrown anytime a browser makes a request
[02:14:05] <chjj> especially not javascript, by way of the language that shall not be named
[02:14:23] <sam350> chjj: thank you
[02:14:57] <anli__> hm, jquery selectbox has no releases...
[02:15:01] <chjj> i actually used to be okay with coffeescript, ive grown to hate it more and more though
[02:15:03] <yogurt_truck> sam350: java _is_ very verbose. which is why one of groovy's main objectives was to have builtin scaffolding features in the language
[02:15:32] <yogurt_truck> chjj: i was kinda waiting to see if cs would take off for real
[02:15:54] <yogurt_truck> but i stopped caring
[02:15:55] <chjj> well, its not like its not doing well
[02:16:01] <chjj> but i just dont like it
[02:16:19] <chjj> i dont like the ex-ruby devs that use it, or the ruby devs that use it, because they dont want to learn js
[02:16:26] <chjj> theyre afraid of prototypes
[02:16:32] <yogurt_truck> lol
[02:16:33] <blackspotwiggins> chjj, not every ruby dev is like that, mind you
[02:16:46] <yogurt_truck> what, cs gets rid of prototypes? :O
[02:16:46] <chjj> yeah, i didnt mean to generalize
[02:16:55] <yogurt_truck> sorry i should read the cs docs
[02:17:06] <chjj> it doesnt get rid of prototypes, but it adds class syntax
[02:17:24] <yogurt_truck> D:
[02:17:26] <blackspotwiggins> it's dumbed down js in short
[02:17:30] <chjj> yes
[02:18:12] <chjj> my concern is the particular ruby devs ( or anyone) who uses it, and insults js at the same time, simply by saying, "oh, cs is so amazing, it makes javascript bearable"
[02:18:16] <RealSolid> is there an easy way to get name/ value pairs from some text that is like  name:value\n
[02:18:26] <chjj> i just want to say, "wow, that was a close one, you actually almost had to learn a language"
[02:19:04] <sam350> chjj: makes me wonder why they dont wrap all languages in a ruby like syntax
[02:19:12] <yogurt_truck> RealSolid: it's not json data?
[02:19:17] <chjj> so i guess its the users who bug me, which would explain why i grow to hate it more over time
[02:19:20] <sam350> and compile it to the language they want
[02:19:42] <chjj> another things which i kind of see as a sin almost, is compiling to high level language
[02:19:50] <chjj> using js as an intermediate language
[02:19:54] <chjj> =/
[02:20:13] <RealSolid> yogurt: i can create the data however i want, but looking for easiest solution
[02:20:22] <RealSolid> ive got some php spitting out some data
[02:20:22] <yogurt_truck> chjj the js orthodox
[02:20:23] <chjj> js is abstracted enough for me, i dont need another layer on top of it
[02:20:26] <RealSolid> just want to one line split it up
[02:21:03] <yogurt_truck> RealSolid: why not spit out json then?
[02:21:42] <yogurt_truck> RealSolid: http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[02:21:43] <RealSolid> thats easy in php?
[02:22:01] <RealSolid> ok cool thanks
[02:22:19] <RealSolid> and the jscript end does what?
[02:22:39] <sam350> RealSolid parse it into array of objects
[02:22:50] <sam350> the js does
[02:22:54] <yogurt_truck> RealSolid: .getJSON() ?
[02:23:06] <sam350> or parseJSON
[02:23:15] <yogurt_truck> you're using jquery, right?
[02:23:22] <jaypitidi> How can I make an array of all of the <a> elements within a certain class?
[02:23:33] <chjj> also, to carry on my rant, ive never liked the trend of hating c syntax
[02:23:35] <yogurt_truck> RealSolid: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[02:23:47] <chjj> i like c syntax, and i like c, i think its very aesthetic actually
[02:23:55] <[Sergiu]> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-dialog-extra/
[02:24:00] <chjj> everyone hates curly braces now
[02:24:05] <yogurt_truck> chjj: i love C
[02:24:06] <Bower^> Yeah I do like C
[02:24:14] <[Sergiu]> is possible to add jquery dialog action on li ? or only on <button>
[02:24:17] <[Sergiu]> ?
[02:24:35] <yogurt_truck> chjj: one of the best examples of beautiful and clear C code is the Git source
[02:25:01] <chjj> hm, im ashamed to say ive never actually read it now, even though i use it every day
[02:25:23] <[Sergiu]> hm,nobody not know about jquery dialog , or nobody dont want to help me?
[02:26:17] <sam350> sergiu how are you calling it
[02:26:29] <sam350> I dont see why you cant on any element you like
[02:26:32] <yogurt_truck> you mean jquery UI dialog?
[02:27:18] <sam350> yep u can call it on anything
[02:27:25] <sam350> look at the source
[02:27:25] <sam350> $('#ex2').click(function(){
[02:27:26] <sam350> 		var div = $('<div />').html('<h3>Hello!</h3> I can be minimized and maximized <b>programmatically</b>!')
[02:27:26] <sam350> 		div.dialog(
[02:27:32] <sam350> ex2 is an element
[02:27:35] <sam350> happens to be a button
[02:27:39] <sam350> could be an LI
[02:27:41] <sam350> anything u want
[02:27:46] <sam350> sorry for the paste guys
[02:27:52] <[Sergiu]> and how can set it to li?
[02:27:56] <[Sergiu]> <li id="ex1">
[02:27:59] <[Sergiu]> ?
[02:28:00] <sam350> same way
[02:28:04] <sam350> ex1
[02:28:12] <[Sergiu]> but not running
[02:28:17] <sam350> $("#ex1").click(function(){
[02:28:19] <sam350> do it all in there
[02:28:31] <sam350> all u gotta do is change the buttons in that source
[02:28:34] <sam350> to lis
[02:28:38] <sam350> and wrap in ul
[02:28:42] <sam350> and you got it
[02:29:32] <sam350> thanks for the link, I hadnt seen that one
[02:29:33] <[Sergiu]>                         <li id="ex1"><a href="#">Trace</a></li>
[02:29:37] <[Sergiu]> is correct?
[02:29:46] <sam350> should be fine,
[02:29:58] <sam350> anything in the LI that's visible and is clicked should run it
[02:30:16] <sam350> I would change the a to a span
[02:30:21] <[Sergiu]> http://178.32.137.37/tools/
[02:30:28] <blackspotwiggins> i would bind it to a to begin with
[02:30:29] <[Sergiu]> see Menu -> Trace
[02:30:33] <[Sergiu]> no effect
[02:31:57] <[Sergiu]> and on whios i removed href.. and not running any way
[02:31:58] <anli__> How big is the js support for the const keyword+
[02:31:59] <anli__> ?
[02:32:12] <blackspotwiggins> anli__, in browsers, next to none
[02:32:21] <anli__> Aha, seems like ff understands it
[02:32:32] <Bower^> I think FF is about it
[02:32:37] <anli__> ok
[02:32:38] <sam350> here ya go http://jsfiddle.net/kCn6S/
[02:32:38] <anli__> what a shame
[02:32:56] <sam350> 2 li are popping it
[02:33:13] <[Sergiu]> uhm , i will try,thanks sam :)
[02:34:09] <[Sergiu]> maybe beacouse my menu use other JS`s...
[02:34:14] <sam350> Serg, most likely
[02:34:22] <sam350> someone is stopping the propegation
[02:34:31] <sam350> returning flase
[02:34:48] <sam350> you building the next OS there http://178.32.137.37/tools/#
[02:34:55] <sam350> whatcha gonna call it
[02:35:02] <[Sergiu]> :))
[02:35:13] <sam350> make sure u build in some good security
[02:35:18] <[Sergiu]> ilaugh at me?
[02:35:23] <[Sergiu]> =)
[02:35:28] <sam350> .htaccess or sometthin
[02:35:30] <sam350> SOMETHIN
[02:35:31] <sam350> hehe
[02:35:35] <sam350> yep iLaugh
[02:35:36] <[Sergiu]> badsam
[02:35:41] <sam350> :/
[02:35:56] <[Sergiu]> sry for "i" :)
[02:35:58] <sam350> dude i made some of those
[02:36:34] <sam350> its fuun
[02:37:05] <sam350> be blastin the music, sayin F U microsoft windows
[02:37:16] <[Sergiu]> ya,is not oS,  i try to make one tool box.. and little "desktop" replication .. but i`m noob on JQuery
[02:37:16] <sam350> 'im king of the computers'
[02:37:19] <[Sergiu]> ;(
[02:37:41] <sam350> ok noob on jquery i give you suggestion
[02:37:45] <sam350> keep it simple and clean
[02:37:54] <sam350> also dont do drugs
[02:38:15] <yogurt_truck> unless they're heavy drugs, which are fine
[02:38:40] <sam350> yah what he said..  its a paradox but
[02:38:43] <sam350> buuut
[02:38:46] <stede> hi all, someone can tell me why this usage of data() wont work: http://pastebin.com/gxxyQbjf ??
[02:38:56] <yogurt_truck> when it comes to jquery, it's all about heavy drugs and bungee jumping
[02:39:11] <[Sergiu]> Among the many vices that I have, even drugs have no place
[02:39:16] <[Sergiu]> ;D
[02:39:21] <sam350> yo stede why not use jsfiddle and DO IT LIVE
[02:39:25] <Bower^> You're missing out dude
[02:39:54] <sam350> Sergiu what is your vice, may I guess? cheeseburgers?  expensive comics?
[02:40:14] <stede> sam350, what kinf of tool/gui is that?
[02:40:26] <sam350> well did you type in url
[02:40:30] <sam350> jsfiddle.com
[02:40:32] <stede> sam350, anything more i can do with firebug?
[02:40:35] <sam350> http://jsfiddle.net/kCn6S/
[02:40:41] <sam350> well for showing ppl code
[02:40:50] <stede> ahh ok
[02:40:52] <sam350> if it is JAVA, ok, pastebin is as far as u can get
[02:40:56] <sam350> but if u using js
[02:41:01] <sam350> why not DO IT LIVE with jsfiddle
[02:41:04] <[Sergiu]> u are funny sam, i`m not fat dexter :))
[02:41:37] <sam350> ahhh he gave us a hint! it's netflix instant isnt it?  I got dat one too
[02:41:53] <sam350> just ONE more ally mcbeal b4 bed
[02:41:55] <sam350> (not kiddin)
[02:42:20] <sam350> so stede u put it in jsfiddle and we look at it for u
[02:43:09] <stede> sam350, yea .. i'm working on it
[02:43:51] <[Sergiu]> i tryed to translate from my lanague "sam,i`m not a mouse" , and google translate tell me "Sam is a mouse"
[02:43:54] <[Sergiu]> :">
[02:44:49] <sam350> haaaa
[02:45:05] <sam350> google translate discontinuing their API so F them
[02:45:17] <sam350> I wrote a bunch of stuff using it
[02:45:42] <sam350> I can only imagine all the confused international users of all the iphone and windows phone apps I wrote
[02:45:52] <sam350> which i used google translate to translate
[02:46:17] <Bower^> hahaha
[02:46:23] <sam350> which has nothing to do with them discontinuing their API- I wrote it statically in the apps
[02:46:40] <sam350> the stuff I wrote was some services to write mobile apps in all languages
[02:46:49] <sam350> but I dont think devs needs more tools
[02:47:03] <[Sergiu]> i tried to translate some documents in English, but with my bad english, I realized it looks awful
[02:47:19] <sam350> hehe
[02:47:34] <sam350> you could order up some turks to do it
[02:47:37] <sam350> anyone know what means
[02:48:10] <stede> sam350, how to paste there functions from other jquery plugins?
[02:50:04] <HardPhuck> http://stele-nh.kompetenzzentrum.sh/index.php?id=25#
[02:50:09] <sam350> <script src="http://yourdomain/pluginscript.js"></script>
[02:50:13] <sam350> load it remotely
[02:50:14] <HardPhuck> why does my caroulse blink
[02:50:24] <HardPhuck> when going right? and not when going left
[02:50:33] <HardPhuck> it's practically the same code
[02:50:39] <sam350> dont even see a carousel on there in safari
[02:51:36] <sam350> oh that is hella big carousel man
[02:51:42] <HardPhuck> not mine
[02:51:45] <sam350> is not blinking for me
[02:51:48] <HardPhuck> just need to make this work
[02:51:56] <HardPhuck> the page is disgusting :)
[02:52:07] <HardPhuck> but i don't care :)
[02:52:16] <HardPhuck> strange... it blinks on chrome mac
[02:52:25] <HardPhuck> just when I click next
[02:52:32] <HardPhuck> when i click 'prev' it works fine
[02:52:49] <sam350> no blink in chrome mac for me
[02:53:21] <HardPhuck> so the slider works fine both ways?
[02:53:24] <sam350> yes
[02:53:54] <sam350> havent seen a blink yet in any browser
[02:54:23] <sam350> but your nick did remind me I was going to visit tube8.com later
[02:54:32] <sam350> so thanx
[02:54:44] <HardPhuck> strange,... when i click next, the current content moves right (with nothing next to it) and when the animation is complete the content of the next slide appears

[03:02:09] <opius> excuse my noobiness, but if i want to concat a string with the value of let's say an input, how is that done?
[03:02:20] <sam350> seriously tho I dont recall seeing porsche in movies set in UK
[03:02:26] <exitdescription> .?

[03:02:48] <sam350> "mystring" + $("#elmid").val()
[03:02:52] <exitdescription> there's prob more ford anglias in the uk
[03:03:06] <opius> sam350, damn .. that's how i tried to do it
[03:03:09] <sam350> opius you need to experiment in console like a mofo and u will not be noob no more
[03:03:16] <opius> then there must be something else
[03:03:18] <sam350> in this case, go to console
[03:03:23] <sam350> and do $("#elmid")
[03:03:26] <sam350> see if you got anything
[03:03:31] <sam350> any elm at all
[03:03:45] <Bower^> sam where you from?
[03:03:46] <sam350> then you can go thru the jquery object the console revel to u

[03:04:42] <sam350> san fran
[03:04:45] <Bower^> Oh
[03:04:50] <Bower^> Nice
[03:05:06] <sam350> toutit use selectors
[03:05:17] <sam350> and/or
[03:05:53] <sam350> $.each($('ul'), function(i,item){  //check if $(item).parent has ul and stuff
[03:06:00] <sam350> })
[03:06:10] <sam350> and return if does not
[03:06:13] <jaypitidi> http://pastebin.com/1KCx6JQx This works however it seems a little redundant to have to append and hide the data. Is there a way to improve this?
[03:06:46] <sam350> put it in jsfiddle and we look at it
[03:06:49] <Kennie> Hi, i got html inputs with the name name[rownumbers][fieldname]... i can select the current item with $("input[name='name[rownumber][fieldname]'")... but how can i get the previous element if rownumber is dynamic? (so now always row-1)
[03:07:02] <sam350> kennie give it an id and give it a rest
[03:07:23] <opius> "/Account/GetAuto.aspx?apa=" + $("#<%= friendsContent.FindControl("TextBox3").ClientID %>").val() , firebug says apa= , the weird thing is that $("#<%= friendsContent.FindControl("TextBox3").ClientID %>" ).autocomplete( part works..
[03:07:26] <jaypitidi> I don't know how to fake an ajax call in jsfiddle
[03:07:29] <sam350> could do parent also
[03:07:35] <Toutiti> oh looking for and/or i found :has() seems to be good
[03:08:06] <sam350> yes toutiti i shouldve thought of that good one
[03:08:32] <Kennie> sam350: id equals the name due other reasons so cant really abuse that
[03:09:18] <sam350> jaypitidi you could have display:none default
[03:09:24] <sam350> then show when u want
[03:09:38] <sam350> even if element is not on page yet
[03:09:47] <sam350> give it class or id when u creawte
[03:10:00] <sam350> and have that style set already
[03:10:09] <sam350> just WAITIN for it to show itself
[03:10:19] <sam350> thats the way MY mind think
[03:10:35] <sam350> kennie, make custom attr
[03:10:39] <sam350> can call anything
[03:10:43] <sam350> and select it with jquery
[03:10:58] <sam350> i also see a regex in your future
[03:11:07] <Kennie> what should the attr contain? current id?
[03:11:17] <sam350> based on the logic which dynamically named it earlier
[03:11:38] <sam350> could contain anything that u can predict later
[03:11:44] <Kennie> the previous one can be removed, so thats not an option
[03:12:06] <Kennie> should be dynamicly looked up at the time of the event
[03:12:55] <sam350> kennie i think you are making a complicated thing here
[03:13:23] <sam350> think u could simplify it some way
[03:14:18] <Kennie> not really, the reference to the previous one is not static
[03:14:48] <sam350> dunno im gettin lost in ure words, put it in jsfiddle
[03:25:46] <sente> what is the proper way to create a div with inner html from an ajax call like the psuedocode: div = $('<div />').html( ajax('/load/page.html'));
[03:27:21] <nail_> ?.load @sente
[03:27:21] <bot-t> sente, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[03:27:27] <nail_> grmm
[03:27:39] <nail_> ?load
[03:27:39] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[03:28:19] <nail_> sente: there's .load() for that
[03:31:40] <Kaseano> hi :) I have to set up a global jq event across a bunch of pages that already use js and vbs.  Is it possible to have jq events fire before an element's onsubmit="fuction" events?
[03:34:04] <bochecha> hi, is it possible with jquery to do string replacement, but specifying at which position to start, and how many occurences to replace?
[03:34:43] <Kaseano> bochecha replace will replace at every occurance, you want to do that with an index?
[03:34:53] <bochecha> Kaseano, yes
[03:35:45] <Kaseano> I think you'd have to use a loop
[03:36:00] <Kaseano> duno tho sorry
[03:36:18] <Kaseano> maybe something clever with regexps
[03:37:06] <bochecha> regex seems like a bad idea for this, I don't really know what's before or after in the text, but I know where I am currently
[03:37:12] <Kaseano> yeah actually with regex you could do something like (.).{10}
[03:37:17] <Kaseano> oh ok
[03:37:22] <sente> thanks guys
[03:37:50] <sente> what if I want to load html form a different domain?
[03:37:55] <Kaseano> well if you dont know the # of characters indexing wouldn't work either i dont think
[03:38:29] <Kaseano> sente i think .load will take a url
[03:38:35] <Kaseano> same with .get
[03:38:35] <bochecha> I know what position I am right now in the string, so I could specify that to a replace function
[03:38:56] <bochecha> i.e « replace 'foo' by 'bar' in the 'foobar' string, starting at position 3
[03:39:24] <bochecha> oh well, I'll try doing it differently if that's not possible
[03:39:45] <Kaseano> i mean u dont have a ton of flexible choices w js http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp
[03:39:57] <Kaseano> I think you can do anything with regex tho
[03:40:21] <bochecha> yeah, I know js is not very helpful in this case but I thought jquery could add a few sugar :)
[03:40:24] <Kaseano> therefore you dont need many js or jq choices lol
[03:40:42] <Kaseano> i've never seen a jq list of string functions
[03:40:53] <Kaseano> i know they exist, or at least jq related string functions like $.trim
[03:42:02] <sente> Kaseano: it only works with resources on the same domain though
[03:42:24] <Kaseano> sente really? i swear it said url in the function definition
[03:42:49] <Kaseano> i guess that's just local then, sorry i duno then
[03:43:15] <Kaseano> that's kind of limiting i'm surprised
[03:44:15] <yarco> how to get form which in another form in jquery?
[03:44:22] <stede> sam350, if i finished my example on jsfiddle, how to store ist and receive a link to post it here?
[03:45:06] <Kaseano> sente http://tinyurl.com/3q8sfaj
[03:45:14] <Kaseano> kinda curious myself but i gotta go to work :)
[03:45:45] <yarco> for example:  form[name=main] - form[name=sub] - input[id=test]     when using  $('#test').parent().attr('name'), it well give me 'main'
[03:45:58] <yarco> well => will
[03:47:47] <stede> whats wrong with my code using .data() -> http://jsfiddle.net/YjV8b/
[03:48:25] <sente> Kaseano: http://curl.sente.cc/see/06.48.10/latest.html
[03:49:33] <Kaseano> hm
[03:56:31] <eml> Anyone have any experience with creating an autocomplete-script which fetches City/Country/Etc names from Google maps? I'm not interested in displaying it on a map at this point, just auto-completion
[03:57:34] <Kingsy_> how do you get <input class="something" value="somevalue">hello</input>    the value "somevalue" ?   I have tried    $(.something).value  but thats undefined
[03:58:11] <yarco> Kingsy_: $('.something').val()
[04:00:15] <Kingsy_> yarco: thanks :)
[04:00:47] <stede> why $.data() dont work? http://jsfiddle.net/YjV8b/
[04:02:03] <Aamir> stede:  no one will read your this much code. Make a simpler demo so people can help
[04:03:05] <stede> Aamir, i did it before and it was told to use jsfiddle .. but here a simple pastebin: http://pastebin.com/gxxyQbjf
[04:03:27] <juha_> coldhead: i'm working on with amazon api stuff, you would love this: "bath & body aids", "daily living aids"
[04:04:35] <Aamir> stede:  what is $(".trackChanges").ready(function(){ ??????
[04:05:22] <stede> Aamir, honestly ... its not needed because the code is in $(document).ready(function(){ section already
[04:07:59] <stede> Aamir, i want to run that once after dom-object load finished
[04:12:39] <stede> Aamir, no idea?
[04:13:24] <Aamir> stede:  to store data you need a DOM element not jQuery object
[04:14:15] <Aamir> stede:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/YjV8b/2/
[04:16:56] <fist> hey, im using .html('test') to change the text of a button - this works fine. if i now use .append('html here') on a different position within the document, the first .html('text') for the button is reseted
[04:17:16] <fist> does someone know how the effect is called
[04:18:25] <fist> i think the append-functions is executed on the default DOM-tree, which is loaded on the first start-up
[04:20:48] <box> Hello guys I'm new to jquery and was wondering if 'language' and 'type' parameters have to be set in the <script> tag? On http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery it only specifies 'type' but examples I've seen across the internet use 'language' too. Is this necessary?
[04:21:58] <sveri> hi, when using the autocomplete plugin, i have to use the pipe as separator to get an array as result in my jquery function, can i use a different separator then the pipe?
[04:23:33] <box> According to w3schools the 'language' parameter does not exist
[04:24:34] <Cork> box: 1. don't use w3schools, 2. language was used before type
[04:24:35] <tim-ma> jQuery is the bomb!
[04:24:49] <Cork> box: so no you shouldn't use language
[04:25:04] <box> Cork ok thanks
[04:25:31] <Cork> box: better sources is developer.mozilla.org and operas tutorials
[04:25:44] <Bower^> developer.mozilla.org has been very helpful for me
[04:25:51] <Bower^> and yes, w3schools shouldn't be used
[04:26:00] <Cork> box: the tutorial i talked about http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/1-introduction-to-the-web-standards-cur
[04:26:46] <sveri> no idea how i can define my own cell separator for the autocomplete plugin?
[04:26:48] <box> brilliant thank you for your time
[04:26:53] <Cork> box: w3schools is a really bad place to start, cause there facts isn't correct
[04:27:16] <Bower^> Cork, I'm still curious about how the retention of data should be treated throughout a page's lifespan. My understanding is that global variables are considered bad practice but other suggestions seem to involve stuffing data that drives JS logic into the html which seems far worse to me
[04:28:16] <Bower^> For example I'm doing a mashup and data that I load on document load is used to drive further API interactions
[04:28:25] <Bower^> I need retention of that data
[04:28:31] <Cork> Bower^: jquery has a nice solution
[04:28:34] <Cork> ?.data
[04:28:35] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[04:28:46] <Bower^> God jQuery is so damn sweet
[04:28:48] <Bower^> thanks man
[04:28:58] <Cork> Bower^: it stors the values in an array with the id of the dom element as key
[04:29:05] <Cork> so its completly separated from the dom
[04:29:11] <Bower^> nice
[04:29:15] <Cork> well not an array but an object
[04:29:20] <Bower^> :)
[04:30:22] <Cork> Bower^: and btw with id i don't mean the id attribute, but the memory id the dom uniq identifyer that each element has
[04:30:44] <Cork> just to be clear ;) )
[04:30:52] <Bower^> Cheers :D
[04:36:02] <iamjonny_> my net died sorry
[04:36:04] <iamjonny_> hi im having a problem with this, http://jsfiddle.net/J6ZW8/ - all its meant to do is duplicate the child-container div, and change the h4 child number to 1,2,3,4,5 etc not duplicate every child number within the h4
[04:36:18] <iamjonny_> anyone can help?
[04:40:04] <iamjonny_> hello?
[04:42:21] <iamjonny_> hi im having a problem with this, http://jsfiddle.net/J6ZW8/ - all its meant to do is duplicate the child-container div, and change the h4 child number to 1,2,3,4,5 etc not duplicate every child number within the h4
[04:48:16] <yarco> hi , how to say an input with attribute 'id' ?   $('input[id*=""]') ?
[04:49:14] <Cork> yarco: just do $('input#id]')
[04:49:24] <Cork> but the input part shouldn't be needed
[04:49:34] <Cork> * $('input#id')
[04:50:13] <yarco> Cork: thanks. get it…$('input[id]'). Cause maybe not "id", ex. value for something else.
[04:50:32] <Cork> yarco: but why do you need to do an attribut selector on id?
[04:50:42] <iamjonny_> please anyone:(?
[04:50:52] <Cork> just use #, its a fast track selector and the best one you can use
[04:51:50] <iamjonny_> hi im having a problem with this, http://jsfiddle.net/J6ZW8/ - all its meant to do is duplicate the child-container div, and change the h4 child number to 1,2,3,4,5 etc not duplicate every child number within the h4
[04:52:14] <yarco> Cork: …i didnt make it clear.  id is only an example, maybe other attribute.
[04:52:24] <Cork> ok
[04:54:21] <Cork> iamjonny_: your sure you want to append it to the child-container and not childrens?
[04:54:42] <Cork> ah, forget about that
[04:56:10] <iamjonny_> basically it should duplicate the div child-container 5 times and then change the h4 to About child 1, then for the second h4 it would be About child 2 etc
[04:56:17] <iamjonny_> Cork ^
[04:56:24] <yarco> Cork: how to copy all of the attributes in one element to another ("id" , "class" should be filtered maybe)?
[04:56:43] <fotoflo> hey, is there a good way to save an image to a chrome extension? like local storage?
[04:57:34] <yarco> Cork: i'm tired doing : $('#testa').attr({someattribute: $('#testb').attr('someattrbute')})
[04:57:48] <BLuEGoD> hi
[04:58:32] <HardPhuck> strange,.. when i click next, the current slides left... then the next just "appears" instead of sliding in:
[04:58:33] <HardPhuck> http://stele-nh.kompetenzzentrum.sh/index.php?id=25#
[04:58:43] <HardPhuck> when i click 'prev' it works fine though
[04:59:33] <Cork> yarco: simplest way is to clone it
[04:59:42] <Cork> ?.clone @ yarco
[04:59:43] <bot-t> yarco, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[05:00:06] <eml> http://jsfiddle.net/LdYQj/2/ can someone help me with the "Interpreted as Script but transferred with MIME type application/json" error? I don't know what more to pass to $.ajax
[05:00:48] <BLuEGoD> when I try to access within an autocomplete function the value of the selected field like $('#field_id :selected').val(), I keep getting the default value, but not the selected one.. any ideas why this is happening?
[05:01:17] <box> I'm having problems with a Facebook type 'like' text based button. If I specify href="#" on the links, once clicked, the page scrolls to the top. If I remove the href parameter, it removes the hand cursor that symbolises a link. How do I get the link and the cursor without the page scrolling?
[05:01:26] <Cork> iamjonny_: you don't want append then
[05:01:43] <iamjonny_> Cork: wat shud i do?
[05:01:44] <Cork> iamjonny_: you want to replace the text in the h4 tag, not add your text to it
[05:01:52] <Cork> iamjonny_: see ?.html
[05:01:52] <bot-t> iamjonny_, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[05:01:58] <Cork> beeep
[05:02:01] <iamjonny_> hmm
[05:02:28] <Cork> iamjonny_: http://api.jquery.com/html/#html2
[05:03:15] <Cork> iamjonny_: alternativly add a span for the count
[05:03:25] <Cork> and change it instead of the complete text in h4
[05:03:35] <iamjonny_> thank you cork, do you know how to make it so its in order?
[05:06:19] <box> Ok I've sorted it using 'return false;' for the onclick handler: <a href="#" id="$objectid" class="like" onclick="return false">+$data</a>
[05:07:02] <kralyk> Hi... in javascript, is there a difference between 'single quotes' and "double quotes" ?
[05:07:08] <Cork> iamjonny_: the function could prob be simplified quite a bit if appendTo after it isn't requered
[05:07:14] <phoe6> Upon change of a URL #f=radio1 I want to make radio1=checked in the UI, without sending the click event
[05:07:19] <Cork> kralyk: don't dubble post!
[05:07:21] <phoe6> how can I do that?
[05:07:36] <iamjonny_> Cork: wat do you mean?
[05:07:36] <phoe6> It is opposite of the event listerner.
[05:08:03] <Cork> iamjonny_: just if you give the element to add it to to duplicate
[05:08:34] <Cork> iamjonny_: it could just do a append_to.append(this.clone())
[05:08:45] <Cork> iamjonny_: and then a simple selector loop over all the h4's
[05:08:55] <iamjonny_> could you show me in jsfiddle?
[05:09:01] <iamjonny_> cork ^
[05:12:34] <Cork> iamjonny_: http://jsfiddle.net/J6ZW8/1/
[05:13:08] <Cork> iamjonny_: http://jsfiddle.net/J6ZW8/2/ forgot to remove one line
[05:15:11] <iamjonny_> that works great
[05:15:21] <iamjonny_> but one more question :)
[05:16:51] <iamjonny_> the number of clones are depending on what the user selects from a select, example they select 10 n it duplicates it 10 times, but if the user decides to change it to five, it makes it so there is 15, i want it to just change the amount of clones?
[05:16:56] <iamjonny_> cork ^
[05:17:36] <Cork> iamjonny_: is there user inputs in it that you care about?
[05:17:57] <iamjonny_> ]i do this
[05:17:58] <iamjonny_> var getid = $(this).attr('value');
[05:18:04] <eml> http://jsfiddle.net/LdYQj/3/ anyone up for some helpin'? Can't find an answer myself despite googlin'
[05:18:09] <iamjonny_> $('.child-container').duplicate($('#childrens'), getid);
[05:18:22] <Cork> iamjonny_: i mean the elements you clone, do they have data that can get lost?
[05:18:49] <iamjonny_> if the user say select 5 from the select, then it puts 5 boxes in there, but if they then go back and select 2 it takes the five away and puts two
[05:18:53] <iamjonny_> cork ^
[05:19:10] <JKarsrud> any of you guys know of a good selectbox plugin for jquery that's not using UI ?
[05:20:02] <phoe6> I have an event wherein if the radio button is selected, I make the change to the URL parameter to do the GET.
[05:20:22] <Cork> eml: you get json, not jsonp
[05:20:33] <phoe6> Now, If I receive the URL with the parameter, how can I make the UI to select the correct radio button.
[05:21:00] <phoe6> as in what jquery method should I use. 'focus() or .select()'
[05:21:08] <Cork> iamjonny_: thats not really an answer, what i mean should x be removed, or can the list be wiped and just the needed ones added?
[05:21:29] <tim-ma> @JKarsrud How about this one http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/projects/js/jquery/selectBox/
[05:21:32] <eml> Cork: Yeah, but then how can I make crossdomain requests? I will get a XMLHttpRequest cannot load error..
[05:21:46] <Cork> ?jsonp @ eml
[05:21:54] <Cork> <_<
[05:22:05] <Cork> ah~~
[05:22:51] <Cork> eml: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP
[05:22:54] <eml> Cork: I just stumbled upon jsonp after googling for my first error, and now I simply don't know how to make the request since the browser won't allow it
[05:23:10] <Cork> eml: the server has to support jsonp
[05:23:24] <Cork> eml: jsonp is basically a javascript file loaded with a function
[05:23:28] <Cork> this function returns the json
[05:23:46] <poppiez> can anyone answer this simple proxy question? http://pastie.org/2374958
[05:23:54] <Cork> eml: so if the server doens't send it as a js function, you can't access it
[05:23:54] <eml> I see, that's probably the error Cork, thanks!
[05:24:04] <Cork> eml: it is
[05:27:24] <tim-ma> Cork: I don't think I fully understand what JSON is. I thought it was a method used for AJAX. Sounds like I'm wrong. Where can I learn about this and please don't say google :)
[05:27:49] <poppiez> tim-ma: JSON is just an object literal (a way to structure data like XML)
[05:28:03] <poppiez> http://www.json.org/js.html
[05:28:34] <tim-ma> poppiez: I see
[05:28:56] <tim-ma> JKarsrud: How about this one http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/projects/js/jquery/selectBox/
[05:29:21] <Cork> tim-ma: json is just a simplified js object
[05:29:35] <Cork> tim-ma: jsonP is another matter though
[05:29:50] <eml> Cork: Let me see if I got this right. I make a request to google's server, which responds with JSONP data, which my own server has to do something with, then the client gets his turn? It's not client->google->back_to_client?
[05:30:03] <tim-ma> Cork: so it's usd to pass data in a secure fashion?
[05:30:38] <Cork> eml: i did a quick check, and it looks like they droped jsonp support in v2, so you can't grab json from there
[05:30:57] <Cork> eml: either use there objects, or proxy it over your own server
[05:31:09] <Cork> tim-ma: kinda
[05:31:37] <Cork> tim-ma: json is a text data format that mapp werry well with js native data types
[05:31:42] <Nacho__> Is there a way to do something after the Dom is ready and page is loaded (visible)?
[05:31:50] <Cork> tim-ma: and its sheap to translate in most other languages too
[05:31:51] <eml> Cork: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/geocoding/index.html I'm using v3, and the only types are json/xml
[05:32:06] <tim-ma> Cork: okay I think I follow
[05:32:13] <Cork> eml: exactly and none of them can be used the way your trying to
[05:32:27] <eml> Cork: :(
[05:32:27] <tim-ma> Cork: just goes to show I shouldn't make assumptions
[05:32:34] <Cork> eml: http://blog.futtta.be/2010/04/09/no-more-jsonp-for-google-geocoding-webservice/
[05:33:32] <eml> Cork: Yay, that's two hours well spent. Thanks for putting an end to it
[05:34:52] <Cork> eml: :)
[05:34:55] <Cork> thats life
[05:35:13] <eml> Life fucking sucks
[05:35:37] <yuizinha> Hi i'm using tabslideout plugin and I'm having Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'tabSlideOut'
[05:35:39] <tim-ma> Cork: This is going to sound stupid but it's my understanding that ajax calls basically dummy an iframe post to submit and retrieve data. I'm assuming I'm wrong again.
[05:36:57] <Cork> tim-ma: ya, the only things iframe and xhr shares is a network connection
[05:37:19] <Cork> tim-ma: two different beasts
[05:38:09] <tim-ma> Cork: so it's a XmlHttpRequest and not an iframe?
[05:38:29] <Cork> tim-ma: yup ajax is xhr
[05:38:35] <tim-ma> i thought so
[05:38:47] <tim-ma> Cork: I'm just trying to get my wires straight
[05:38:53] <Cork> XD
[05:38:54] <eml> Well if anyone has a good suggestion please tell me: I simply want to create an autocomplete for locations. If a user types in "Vaasa" I want to suggest stuff like "Vaasa, Finland" for him
[05:39:06] <tim-ma> Cork: you seem knowledgable so grabbed the chance :)
[05:42:04] <Cork> eml: you could try using the geo api goole uses
[05:42:22] <Cork> you have to wrap it around a bit, but should be doable
[05:43:14] <eml> Cork: Yeah, seems like such a waste though :/
[05:43:37] <Cork> eml: isn't really that much of a differens in weight
[05:43:54] <JKarsrud> tim-ma: yah, that could work
[05:44:08] <HardPhuck> okay, 15€ for someone that can fix me a problem that should be easy to someone well versed in jquery
[05:44:22] <HardPhuck> pm me
[05:44:39] <Cork> ?ask @ hardnrgg
[05:44:40] <bot-t1> hardnrgg, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:44:42] <JKarsrud> except for the markup it creates :/
[05:44:44] <Cork> bah...
[05:44:50] <Cork> HardPhuck: ^
[05:46:12] <HardPhuck> Great... can't pay people for help
[05:46:19] <HardPhuck> that's nice
[05:46:51] <yuizinha> Hi i'm using tabslideout plugin and I'm having Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'tabSlideOut'
[05:46:58] <yuizinha> anyone can help me?
[05:47:32] <Cork> yuizinha: looks like your adding an object to a string but see ?p
[05:47:32] <bot-t1> yuizinha, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:49:06] <HardPhuck> Cork, could you point me where I can find jquery people that I need fast and want to pay them?
[05:49:52] <HardPhuck> Obviously employing them isn't an option since i only need 10 minutes of time (or so)
[05:50:36] <yuizinha> Cork: sorry but I cant understand how to use these tools... (I'm n00b)
[05:51:30] <Cork> yuizinha: sorry can't stay gtg
[05:51:54] <BLuEGoD> when I try to access within an autocomplete function the value of the selected field like $('#field_id :selected').val(), I keep getting the default value, but not the selected one.. any ideas why this is happening?
[05:53:58] <yuizinha> Cork: ok thanks anyway
[05:54:33] <HardPhuck> ok here we go then: http://stele-nh.kompetenzzentrum.sh/index.php?id=25#
[05:54:46] <HardPhuck> this carousel works only if there are 3 items in it
[05:54:53] <HardPhuck> but not when there are two
[05:55:00] <HardPhuck> what could be wrong here?
[05:55:11] <HardPhuck> http://stele-nh.kompetenzzentrum.sh/fileadmin/stele-nh/templates/js/slider.js
[05:55:17] <HardPhuck> this is the javascript
[06:08:09] <silv3r_m00n> is it possible to do a .live without an event means $(selector).live(function() { $(this).class etc })
[06:08:26] <silv3r_m00n> to execute a function for each object just upon addition
[06:13:03] <BLuEGoD> I've got an autocomplete jquery function which tries to access $('#element_id :selected').val() when is called, however this value is not getting updated when selecting different values and I go to the field which uses the autocomplete function.. does anyone know why this is happening?
[06:16:41] <jeffsmykil> so I can't get IE to refresh this XML data
[06:16:47] <jeffsmykil> its using the cache no matter what i do
[06:19:46] <Bower^> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/4ZmD8/ - Could you please explain how I would get the .click() function within displayAlbums to treat i as the value used when the passed the function and not the value of i when it is invoked at a later date
[06:22:32] <ajpiano> ?forloopscope @ Bower^
[06:22:33] <bot-t1> Bower^, http://forum.jquery.com/topic/binding-event-to-element-dynamically#14737000000958061
[06:23:01] <Bower^> sweet, cheers
[06:23:38] <Bower^> ajpiano, any thoughts on the general structure of that code? I'm still new so not entirely sure what is "correct"
[06:24:44] <ajpiano> it's better than it was :)
[06:24:49] <Bower^> hehe
[06:24:58] <ajpiano> i see you took my advice though so that is good :)
[06:25:06] <Bower^> :)
[06:25:15] <ajpiano> i'm not sure why you don't just put the rest of those methods as part of your api
[06:25:20] <ajpiano> instead of just having global functions
[06:25:26] <ajpiano> and the code in the doc ready is kind of hard to parse
[06:26:25] <fris> is jsfiddle open source?
[06:26:49] <ajpiano> and when i write an $.ajax wrapper, i tend to just merge objects togethr, instead of having specific args like that
[06:27:38] <yarco> i did a plugin, yeah! http://bbish.net/05toolsproducts/63/jquery-
[06:27:56] <Bower^> merge objects together? if you have a spare moment could you please edit the fiddle to demonstrate these improvements?
[06:28:03] <Guest29721> is there a way to print/echo a jquery object?
[06:28:48] <butterfly> Guest25746, object? What would you print?
[06:29:02] <Bower^> Guest29721, if you're on firefox then download firebug then just console.log(jQueryObj)
[06:29:10] <Bower^> within the code
[06:29:12] <Guest29721> im on IE
[06:29:23] <Bower^> google Firebug alternatives or something
[06:30:06] <Guest29721> not possible to dump it in a tag?
[06:31:01] <Bower^> Never tried man
[06:31:29] <navaru> hey, is there any more beautiful way to write this? http://jsfiddle.net/navaru/de75L/2/  ... instead of the ternary operator, something that will work with the bitwise operator?
[06:31:35] <Bower^> If you're coding JS without a debugger you're a mad man
[06:31:39] <Bower^> so get firebug
[06:32:12] <butterfly> Guest25746, what you want do?
[06:32:14] <Bower^> people in here like chrome so if you can't find an IE alternative, check out chrome alternatives
[06:34:04] <navaru> no one?
[06:37:37] <anli__> How do I scroll up the webpage?
[06:38:00] <anli__> Tried $(document).attr('offsetTop', 0);
[06:38:01] <tbranyen> page up or your mouse scroll wheel, or even just click and drag that scroll bar on the right
[06:38:09] <BLuEGoD> I've got an autocomplete jquery function which tries to access $('#element_id :selected').val() when is called, however this value is not getting updated when selecting different values and I go to the field which uses the autocomplete function.. does anyone know why this is happening?
[06:38:17] <anli__> tbranyen: I have no mouse wheel ;)
[06:38:28] <anli__> And I cant drag the mouse
[06:38:32] <anli__> Its stuck in the table
[06:38:52] <anli__> So this is clearly a jquery problem...
[06:40:14] <anli__> Ah, $(document).scrollTop(0); to the rescue
[06:40:56] <ajpiano> Bower^: again, for example purposes only http://jsfiddle.net/4ZmD8/1/
[06:41:10] <ajpiano> Bower^: and if you'd only return the $.ajax call it self, or $.getJSON etc, as i did in that example
[06:41:17] <ajpiano> you can get that "observable" interface you were talking about
[06:41:29] <ajpiano> where you can just attach callbacks and those will be fired when it's ready and not before that
[06:42:45] <Bower^> Thanks mate, always appreciated! I'll have a proper look at the changes in a min
[06:52:32] <Bower^> ajpiano, what's return $.ajax( $.extend(true, defaults, options) ); about?
[06:52:50] <Bower^> Wait, I'll read the API properly
[06:52:51] <Bower^> Sorry
[06:53:00] <ajpiano> $.extend merges objects together, the first 'true' flag does a deep recursive extend.... those optoins get passed to ajax
[06:53:00] <ajpiano> etc
[06:53:01] <ajpiano> ok
[06:53:33] <fris> what would be the best way to do an upload via an ipad using browse, html5 uploader?
[06:57:10] <er91> cool
[06:58:45] <er91> hi everybody, when it comes to ajax browsing, there's jquery address plugin and jquery history plugin. Which one do you guys prefer?
[06:59:04] <ajpiano> neither
[06:59:07] <ajpiano> use BBQ or History.js
[06:59:10] <ajpiano> ?ba bbq
[06:59:30] <ajpiano> http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/docs/
[06:59:32] <er91> and may i ask the reason?
[06:59:42] <ajpiano> https://github.com/balupton/History.js
[06:59:53] <er91> seems that address and history plugins are both well maintained, and more importantly, html5 friendly
[07:00:03] <GreyTrilby> what ho @ajpiano!
[07:00:52] <ajpiano> better maintained and more html5 friendly?
[07:01:34] <ajpiano> if you want real html5 magic juice then you want pushstate where its available, not just hash history
[07:02:13] <er91> http://www.asual.com/jquery/address/
[07:02:45] <er91> this is the address plugin, which i am using now
[07:02:52] <er91> http://www.asual.com/jquery/address/
[07:02:56] <er91> quite convenient
[07:03:21] <ajpiano> so are the other things i mentioned
[07:03:31] <ajpiano> it's up to you, vet them and pick whichever you want
[07:04:23] <er91> what bothers me now is, as the website grows, there are more and more ajax components
[07:04:32] <Bower^> ajpiano, I'm still a bit confused about the new LastFMAPI function. return $.ajax( $.extend(true, defaults, options) ); - what exactly is options? from reading about extend() it's just the deep-copy flag, target object and further objects but I can't see how that relates exactly
[07:04:41] <er91> and it makes maintain the ajax links very complicated
[07:04:44] <Bower^> Sorry I've been awake nearly 24 hours now, probably not helpin :D
[07:04:54] <ajpiano> Bower^: options is the object of options you pass to the request wrapper
[07:04:56] <c0mputer> Got a cross-browser compatability issue. My simple script sets a fixed position div to absolute when the viewport is scrolled within 200px of the bottom of the document height. Works in FF4/Chrome. Doesn't work in IE7 or IE8. jsFiddle example here: http://jsfiddle.net/HVhLw/27/
[07:05:03] <GreyTrilby> Afternoon all - I'm trying to write a script that will show a bunch of divs sequentially. I can get the id of the first div without any problems, but when I use that as a selector and use next() it falls over. Code is here. Can someone point me in the right direction/re-direction please? http://jsfiddle.net/zcsb9/1/
[07:05:08] <ajpiano> i may have forgotten to put it into the example
[07:05:10] <Bower^> ahh
[07:05:57] <Bower^> hmm
[07:06:04] <ajpiano> GreyTrilby: it's invalid to have an id that starts with a numeric char or is entirely numeric, fyi
[07:06:29] <GreyTrilby> GAH! Knew I was missing something obvious - do you think that would solve the problem?
[07:06:36] <ajpiano> no, i don
[07:06:41] <ajpiano> just pointing it out
[07:07:16] * GreyTrilby suspects a brain transplant might solve it
[07:07:22] * ajpiano agrees
[07:07:22] <ajpiano> :p
[07:07:33] <GreyTrilby> gee, thanks :)
[07:07:44] <ajpiano> GreyTrilby: it's woefully invalid to have multiple duplicate ids in a document
[07:07:51] <ajpiano> the idea that you'd track the state of your application
[07:08:04] <ajpiano> by dynamically changing the ID of the main navigation... is spurious
[07:08:34] <GreyTrilby> I don't have multiple ids
[07:08:56] <ajpiano> you have multiple ids the second you take the id of the first item and then assign it to the menu nav
[07:08:56] <GreyTrilby> actually, except where there's confusion on the first one, but I can tweak that fairly easily
[07:09:26] <ajpiano> GreyTrilby: you are supposed to use memory and variables to track state, not the DOM
[07:09:33] <GreyTrilby> i'm debating whether i'd be better doing this via php, but since it's one call vs up to 90
[07:09:50] <GreyTrilby> i'm thinking jq is the better option
[07:10:03] <Bower^> ajpiano, I store stuff in the DOM in my example
[07:10:24] <GreyTrilby> brb
[07:10:29] <ajpiano> there's a difference between storing a bit of metadata you need to consume in the dom and then using it in your app
[07:10:30] <anli__> ajpiano: supposed to? who is saying that? :)
[07:10:41] <ajpiano> versus using the DOM as a cheap container to lump shit into and read back out
[07:10:43] <ajpiano> i am.
[07:10:49] <juha_> trolol i'm at school and they just mentioned modernizr
[07:10:57] <anli__> Nothing is worse than having variables which contents you can retreive from the DOM
[07:10:59] <tbranyen> juha_: what school?
[07:11:11] <ajpiano> anli__: what are you talking about?
[07:11:17] <juha_> some school that teaches some sort of web stuff
[07:11:27] <tbranyen> ic
[07:11:33] <Bower^> isn't .data() a way of storing data in the DOM?
[07:11:39] <anli__> A bad way
[07:11:43] <anli__> But a way
[07:11:47] <Bower^> Hmm
[07:11:47] <ajpiano> Bower^: no, it's not
[07:11:47] <blackspotwiggins> Bower^, .data() doesnt store in dom
[07:11:58] <anli__> Ah, true
[07:12:00] <ajpiano> when you use data it is NOT in the DOM, it is stored inside of jQuery.cache
[07:12:01] <anli__> My mistake
[07:12:06] <Bower^> ah nice
[07:12:15] <juha_> and now the teacher is talkin about html5boilerplate <3
[07:12:46] <anli__> ajpiano: I was talking about the ugliness of keeping variables that you dont need, because you already have it in the DOM
[07:13:01] <ajpiano> well congrats on having it back-asswards
[07:13:04] <anli__> I dont have a single global
[07:13:21] <anli__> There can be no inconsitencies that way
[07:13:25] <ajpiano> the idea that endless amounts of DOM traversal is a better program structure than storing  logical objects with member properties in memory is laughable
[07:13:43] <kborchers> ajpiano: preach brother!!
[07:14:03] <anli__> I have never encountered endless amounts of DOM traversal, then the webpage clearly is too big
[07:14:31] <Brodingo> what school juha_
[07:14:54] <kborchers> i love joining #jquery and the first thing i see is <ajpiano> well congrats on having it back-asswards ... love starting the day with a laugh :D
[07:15:02] <anli__> hehe
[07:15:08] <ajpiano> endless doesn't mean "taking a long time" it means "the querying never ends because every time you need to find out something about the state of your program you're doing a DOM query"
[07:15:44] <anli__> What can better represent the webpage than the DOM
[07:15:55] <ajpiano> your application isn't "a webpage"
[07:16:05] <ajpiano> if you need to load some initial data in from the DOM, that's fine
[07:16:37] <ajpiano> but if you think that you should be doing var thingy = $(this).closest("row").find("td.thingy").text()
[07:16:38] <rosco_y> I'm trying to learn JSON: jsonlint is giving me this error: can anyone help?  http://paste2.org/p/1586955
[07:16:48] <anli__> Well, if you are more happy with a ton of variables, then who am I to break it for you
[07:16:53] <ajpiano> every time you need to find out the value of the thingy attribute of the thing you clicked, that's just insane
[07:16:56] <ajpiano> it's not "a tonne of variables"
[07:16:57] <Bower^> hmm ajpiano I think there might be a couple of errors in the fiddle you posted but I'm not sure which are intended changes and what aren't. Doesn't help I'm bloody tired. http://jsfiddle.net/4ZmD8/1/ - any chance you could please edit that so it would work?
[07:17:13] <Bower^> I'll get a coffee then have a proper read of it
[07:17:18] <anli__> var thingy = $(this).closest("row").find("td.thingy").text() seems to be a too line for not breaking out in a function
[07:17:30] <ajpiano> anli__: what is a "too line"
[07:17:34] <anli__> ooh
[07:17:36] <anli__> too long line
[07:17:38] <anli__> sorry
[07:17:47] <ajpiano> wow
[07:17:51] <juha_> Brodingo: audio visual communications
[07:17:57] <anli__> ajpiano: ?
[07:18:29] <ajpiano> i'm curious what your programs could possibly look like
[07:18:40] <blackspotwiggins> how can you even store functions in dom
[07:18:42] <anli__> But I already know what your programs would look like
[07:18:46] <Brodingo> juha_ name/location?
[07:18:49] <ajpiano> anli__: at the last jquery conference there were a NUMBER of talks about how to get truth OUT of the DOM and INTO your program
[07:18:55] <anli__> blackspotwiggins: I dont store functions in the DOM :)
[07:19:05] <juha_> Brodingo: school in finland
[07:19:17] <Brodingo> ahh ok
[07:19:22] <blackspotwiggins> anli__, so you keep data in dom
[07:19:28] <tbranyen> Brodingo: toString() the function store it, then eval it back out
[07:19:28] <anli__> ajpiano: But when you have got the truth from the DOM and used it, you can also discard the truth
[07:19:29] <blackspotwiggins> and everything else in a private scope ?
[07:19:41] <anli__> I dont use globals
[07:19:47] <ajpiano> anli__: i think you are making an absurd generalisation when you say that "a ton of variables" is what you get if you try to move stuff out of the dom
[07:19:50] <ajpiano> anli__:  neither do i
[07:20:03] <BaconJuice> hey can anyone help me?
[07:20:04] <ajpiano> storing stuff in memory != storing stuff in a global
[07:20:06] <BaconJuice> http://jsfiddle.net/Hpf2Z/
[07:20:18] <BaconJuice> how do I read the first name
[07:20:20] <anli__> Well, if you get a variable you could be without, I have the rule to not introduce it in the code, lets respect different opinons here! :)
[07:20:29] <BaconJuice> and time
[07:20:35] <alaing> hi I have two "radio" buttons and I have delegated a change event but in IE if I click on an option it does not select the option it simple deselects the previous option so it requires me to click twice before it selects the radio option. any ideas what maybe causing this?
[07:20:42] <BaconJuice> can someone shoe me a demo code so I can understand?
[07:20:45] <ajpiano> anli__: all about respect :)
[07:20:52] <anli__> I would not store a local in the DOM :)
[07:20:55] <BaconJuice> I pasted the json on the css itself so you can see
[07:21:07] <stede> how can i investigate/debug if my .post() call always get "error" as result?
[07:21:13] <anli__> And remove it from the DOM when the local scope is gone ;)
[07:21:39] <ajpiano> i think it's time for me to go buy the coffee i have been needing to buy
[07:22:18] <alaing> could it be my return false thats stoping it from selecting the clicked option?
[07:22:52] <BaconJuice> can you anyone help me?
[07:22:54] <BaconJuice>  http://jsfiddle.net/Hpf2Z/
[07:23:05] <anli__> You can always select it manually, option.attr('selected', 'selected');
[07:23:29] <ajpiano> BaconJuice: $.each(data, function() { })
[07:23:29] <ajpiano> ?
[07:23:47] <BaconJuice> ajpiano: can you expand on that? Im very new to this
[07:23:55] <BaconJuice> so how would I read the name element?
[07:24:23] <alaing> anli__: yes I know that but the user is clickin on the option let me knock up a demo
[07:24:36] <ajpiano> $.each(json.trips, function(i, trip) {  console.log(trip.name); })
[07:24:52] <DevBrPb> hi friends
[07:25:04] <anli__> BaconJuice: I would use http://jsfiddle.net/Hpf2Z/2/
[07:25:26] <blackspotwiggins> ajpiano, do you know if there's a good reason why $.each and $.map have different argument orders?
[07:25:50] <ajpiano> $.map is designed to have the same arg order as Array.prototype.map
[07:26:05] <ajpiano> whereas $.each is for whatever reason just consistent with the jquery style of iteration john cooked up in 2005
[07:26:10] <ajpiano> so we get the index first
[07:26:11] <ajpiano> :/
[07:26:19] <ajpiano> which is fine as long as you know that it is the case :)
[07:26:25] <blackspotwiggins> i fund it curious that they are not consistent with eachother
[07:26:39] <DevBrPb> anybody know how i can get the class name of the id clicked?
[07:26:46] <BaconJuice> ajpiano: so how would I access the second name?
[07:26:59] <ajpiano> BaconJuice: that's a loop, dwag
[07:27:01] <ajpiano> dawg*
[07:27:08] <ajpiano> youre gonna access the name prop on each item in the array
[07:27:25] <kborchers> DevBrPb: $("#clicked").attr("class");
[07:27:32] <DevBrPb> i thye var classofmyid = document.getElementsByClassName($this);
[07:27:39] <anli__> no, .attr('className');
[07:27:50] <ajpiano> lol
[07:27:55] <kborchers> hah
[07:27:59] <DevBrPb> thanks kborchers, i'll try
[07:28:02] <ajpiano> either this.className
[07:28:10] <ajpiano> or $(this).attr("class")
[07:28:16] <ajpiano> using attr to get a prop == bad
[07:28:21] <anli__> why? :)
[07:28:34] <BaconJuice> ajpiano: what I didn't want to loop and only access it directly?
[07:28:34] <Bower^> I don't understand your code ajpiano :( is your method the only way to get that behaviour I desire?
[07:28:36] <ajpiano> because it's jquery 1.6.2 and now we have a .prop method for accessing properties
[07:28:47] <anli__> But you say its bad, why?
[07:28:51] <blackspotwiggins> .attr('className') seems super useless
[07:28:57] <blackspotwiggins> if you could just do .className
[07:28:57] <BaconJuice> lets say I wanted to access the second name directly then what?
[07:29:14] <anli__> blackspotwiggins: I agree, you dont need to className for much
[07:29:16] <ajpiano> BaconJuice: json.trips[0].name
[07:29:26] <BaconJuice> ajpiano: ah ok thanks
[07:29:35] <ajpiano> anli__: you can wipe your ass with newspaper ... gets the job done
[07:29:37] <ajpiano> but...
[07:29:44] <anli__> ?
[07:29:47] <ajpiano> there is a certain type of paper designed for it
[07:29:54] <anli__> haha
[07:30:14] <anli__> Is that how you motivate that I should use .prop instead of .attr?
[07:30:15] <anli__> lol
[07:30:20] <ajpiano> no
[07:30:32] <ajpiano> you should use prop when you're accessing properties and attr when you're accessing attributes :)
[07:30:40] <anli__> hm, makes sense
[07:30:46] <ajpiano> or just acces the properties directly off the elem :)
[07:31:02] <JKarsrud> no. Use attr all the time! So easy <3
[07:31:09] <anli__> word
[07:31:11] <alaing> where can i see what buigs were fixed in 1.4.3 and 1.4.4
[07:31:13] <kborchers> anli__: or you could store the prop as a global ;)
[07:31:17] <anli__> haha
[07:31:25] <blackspotwiggins> use straight up dom
[07:31:26] <anli__> I dont know how to use the var keyword outside functions :)
[07:31:50] <alaing> i think i'm experiencing a bug in 1.4.2 as I tried to make a demo on jsfiddle and my code works
[07:32:06] <kborchers> alaing: then it's not a bug in 1.4.2
[07:32:09] <blackspotwiggins> alaing, why bother with 1.4 when 1.6 is out?
[07:32:15] <kborchers> and you should use 1.6.2
[07:32:26] <alaing> I know....
[07:32:51] <alaing> but its complicated application so not as simple as just upgrading
[07:33:08] <blackspotwiggins> alaing, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKYQ5ibxslI
[07:33:47] <alaing> lol@ blackspotwiggins
[07:33:52] <kborchers> blackspotwiggins: i love The IT Crowd!
[07:33:57] <alaing> sometimes i wonder myself
[07:34:14] <alaing> blackspotwiggins: short answer......yes
[07:34:51] <alaing> not my fault as my firm only went over from IE5 to IE7 about a year ago....I know crazy init
[07:35:09] <ajpiano> did you say IE5
[07:35:11] <anli__> IE what?
[07:35:18] <alaing> I had to fight tooth and nail for FF
[07:35:18] <blackspotwiggins> you are from the past
[07:35:27] <anli__> Isnt IE6 the first version? ;)
[07:35:28] <alaing> ajpiano: yes thats right
[07:35:49] <kborchers> alaing: just keep in mind that the longer you wait, the harder it will be to do your upgrade as more and more things change
[07:36:09] <blackspotwiggins> alaing, quit. now.
[07:36:12] <stede> if i call $.post(..) it always call the error: section. how can i investigate WHY?!
[07:36:28] <alaing> blackspotwiggins: trust me i have come close to it
[07:36:36] <pissypaw> howdy
[07:36:37] <anli__> stede: Easist way is to see what comes in with firebug
[07:36:48] <alaing> blackspotwiggins: but i enjoy the "challenge" lol
[07:37:01] <stede> anli__, never used that function of firebug before ... i'll check that
[07:37:10] <anli__> Yeah, you cant be without it
[07:37:17] <DevBrPb> ajpiano: O.o ok and kborchers thanks to help me
[07:37:18] <anli__> Firebug is a must
[07:37:24] <stede> anli__, it is in the "script" section?
[07:37:28] <anli__> net
[07:38:37] <alaing> kborchers: thanks...I have put it on my schedule but I'm mainly waiting for UI 1.9 for tooltips and thought I would bump up all the versions in on go.
[07:39:24] <stede> anli__, hrhr 404 not found ^^
[07:39:46] <alaing> especially from jquery 1.6 I heard there are quiet a few changes with .attr
[07:39:50] <stede> anli__, because it tries to open 'Object object'
[07:40:26] <kborchers> stede: if you're getting a 404, your page that you are posting to does not exist
[07:40:44] <pissypaw> i'm building a news ticker widget. it cycles three slides. if you have the page with this ticker open in a tab in the background for a while and then return to it then the nextSlide() function runs over and over in rapid succession. must be some wacky thing about setTimeout(). anybody have any ideas? http://pastebin.com/NW1G2mFT
[07:41:13] <SergSergiu> hm
[07:41:21] <pissypaw> see the bug in action at firstclickconsulting.com.au
[07:41:32] <SergSergiu> how can i use function:         $('#ex1').click(function(){
[07:41:43] <kborchers> alaing: yeah, the major 1.6 tripping point was that whole attr vs. prop discussion that your question sparked a bit ago
[07:41:50] <SergSergiu> <li><a href="#Course1" class="launch" onclick="alert('event 1')">Trace</a></li>
[07:41:54] <SergSergiu> something like this
[07:41:56] <rbelo> de
[07:41:56] <GreyTrilby> ok, it's been pointed out to me that my overall methodology is c**p, so I'd like your advice on alternatives if possible. Basically I have a minute-by-minute account of an historic football match. Each minute is logged in a db. What I want to do is "play" this as if it's being streamed live to a website. For this I figure I need the minute, the minute of the next item (so I can calculate the difference between them) and then run nu
[07:42:02] <SergSergiu> bun onclick i need to action #ex1.. :)
[07:42:04] <SergSergiu> is possible?
[07:42:18] <alaing> kborchers: my question?
[07:42:45] <GreyTrilby> what I'm struggling with is the way to get the 'minute' of the next entry (currently hidden) so I can calculate this difference before doing a show() on it
[07:42:54] <GreyTrilby> any suggestions please?
[07:43:05] <kborchers> alaing: my bad, not your question
[07:43:16] <pissypaw> SergSergiu: <a href="#something" id="bongs">blah</a>... then in jQuery $('#bongs').click(function(){ alert('hi there'); });
[07:43:17] <alaing> lol
[07:43:40] <stede> anli__, kborchers, yes .. i fixed it. it now return (i see that in firebug) the json value as it should, but the jquery ajax call still runs into the "error:" function ?!
[07:43:41] <alaing> pissypaw nice nick lol
[07:43:49] <SergSergiu> pissy , try without alert,i want just to action ex1
[07:44:16] <SergSergiu> function is predefinited , not just complete function on <a href=...
[07:44:41] <GreyTrilby> @serg - replace "alert()" with "ex1()"
[07:44:56] <GreyTrilby> #ex1 is not a function, it's a selector
[07:45:11] <SergSergiu> i try,thanks grey/pissy
[07:46:08] <kborchers> stede: are you using .ajax or .post?
[07:47:21] <pissypaw> SergSergiu: I think you're getting confused about the # symbol. if used in href="#" it refers to an anchor link in that page and is sometimes used in javascript to mean "no link but to javascript stuff". in jquery the # means ID when selecting. you can select id="foo" with $('#foo') and class="foo" with $('.foo')
[07:47:34] <pissypaw> -to +do
[07:47:43] <stede> kborchers, just tried ajax instead of post ... but it has no effect
[07:47:58] <stede> kborchers, just adding method: 'POST' if using .ajax
[07:48:18] <SergSergiu> pissy.. thats problem, i tryed to use on my menu with id=ex1 , and not running, only on menu not running... beacouse is writed in jS too..and some conflicts
[07:48:25] <kborchers> can you paste that piece of your code on jsfiddle.net?
[07:48:36] <SergSergiu> but.. with onclick(alert) running.. and i want to try with onclick(ex1..some)
[07:48:43] <SergSergiu> alert running.. :)
[07:50:26] <stede> kborchers, i add some debug echo to my file which i'm quering .. seems post-data is emtpy!
[07:51:27] <stede> kborchers, the post data i want to send must be in format data: { "name01": "valueString01" } .. like this?
[07:51:40] <kborchers> stede: you can't do that
[07:52:06] <kborchers> you can't post an object, it must be serialized like name01=valueString01&name02.....
[07:52:09] <stede> kborchers, i know - just do it know to see the result for debug reasons in firebug
[07:53:55] <Eviltwin> kborchers: You can post JSON
[07:54:17] <stede> Eviltwin, yeah .. that what i do
[07:54:34] <kborchers> Eviltwin: as a string
[07:54:39] <StPiere> i have some JQuery object $el. how to select its child '.close' , for example $el.children('.close') ????
[07:54:41] <Eviltwin> kborchers: Yes, that's what JSON is
[07:54:44] <stede> if i investigate the ajax request in firebug i can see the post data
[07:55:05] <Eviltwin> StPiere: Immediate child or anywhere below it?
[07:55:08] <kborchers> but when he said data: { ... }, that is not a JSON string, that is a JS object
[07:55:45] <BaconJuice> http://jsfiddle.net/Hpf2Z/3/ this doesn't work
[07:55:45] <Eviltwin> Well what you said didn't have ""'s around it, it wouldn't parse if you threw it in JavaScript
[07:55:49] <BaconJuice> any ideas guys?
[07:56:26] <StPiere> Eviltwin: any child
[07:56:41] <Eviltwin> StPiere: So include children's children?
[07:57:15] <StPiere> Eviltwin: yes
[07:57:19] <kborchers> Eviltwin: that may be true but i asked to see his code and if that's all i see, then i have to assume that is exactly as it's written
[07:57:19] <Eviltwin> BaconJuice: json is not defined
[07:57:30] <BaconJuice> Eviltwin: what do you mean?
[07:57:37] <stede> and how i must define my data to provide it to the post request?
[07:57:45] <StPiere> Eviltwin: i need just the first child in the nodetree
[07:57:46] <BaconJuice> how do I define? can you provide an example?
[07:57:48] <stede> i'tried it like documented on jequery.com
[07:57:49] <Eviltwin> BaconJuice: Your callback function has a variable data
[07:57:58] <Eviltwin> BaconJuice: Then you try to access a variable called json
[07:58:56] <stede> BaconJuice, http://pastebin.com/23nc31XZ
[07:59:08] <Eviltwin> StPiere: $el.find(':nth-child(0)')
[07:59:37] <StPiere> thanks Eviltwin
[08:00:06] <Eviltwin> BaconJuice: Try http://jsfiddle.net/Hpf2Z/5/
[08:01:30] <BaconJuice> Eviltwin: doesnt work
[08:01:58] <Eviltwin> BaconJuice: Can you explain what you're trying to do?
[08:02:06] <kborchers> stede: thinking a little more, that should work ... but on the server side, your data will come through formatted as "name01=valueString01" not {name01: valueString01}
[08:02:45] <stede> kborchers, on serverside there is no data in $_POST at all! thats what i'm wondering about
[08:02:53] <BaconJuice> Eviltwin: just trying to read the second name from the json file I provided in the CSS section
[08:03:05] <Eviltwin> That JSON file is improperly formatted
[08:03:09] <Eviltwin> You have a trailing comma
[08:03:17] <Eviltwin> { "name":"Duomo and Duomo Museum", "time":"am" },
[08:04:37] <Eviltwin> stede: If you're trying to send JSON data, try this: file_get_contents("php://input")
[08:04:48] <Eviltwin> Or json_decode(file_get_contents("php://input"))
[08:05:58] <stede> Eviltwin, where should i use that? do you read what the problem is?
[08:06:15] <Eviltwin> stede: You said server side there was no $_POST
[08:06:43] <Eviltwin> stede: If you're posting JSON data, it won't be defined
[08:06:51] <Eviltwin> stede: Since the data is in a different encoding
[08:06:57] <stede> Eviltwin, ahhh ok
[08:07:25] <Eviltwin> stede: The first command I sent you gets the raw data posted to PHP
[08:07:29] <stede> Eviltwin, and how must i prepare the client side data if i want to use the $_POST data at server side script?
[08:07:31] <Eviltwin> The second gets the data then attempts to parse it as JSON
[08:08:06] <Eviltwin> stede: It needs to be formatted like a query string to use $_POST: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string
[08:10:56] <stede> Eviltwin, okay .. i get that stuff ... but it also do not explain why .ajax() always return error: no matter what the server side script returns
[08:11:21] <Eviltwin> stede: Do you have Firebug or the Safari/Chrome debug tools?
[08:11:38] <stede> firefox+firebug
[08:11:47] <Eviltwin> Does the XHR show an error?
[08:11:51] <stede> nope
[08:11:59] <Eviltwin> Can I see your code?
[08:12:04] <stede> it shows the (debug)output from the serverside script
[08:12:25] <stede> file_get_contents shows the string i provide
[08:12:33] <stede> but json_parse has no effect on that
[08:12:34] <Eviltwin> The JavaScript code
[08:12:37] <BaconJuice> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/Hpf2Z/6/ ok adjusted it..so can you tell me how I can read the second element name only?
[08:12:39] <Eviltwin> The one making the $.ajax
[08:13:01] <stede> Eviltwin, roughly like this:
[08:13:02] <stede> http://pastebin.com/23nc31XZ
[08:13:14] <kborchers> stede: error: alert('error'), should be error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, error) {alert('error')},
[08:13:14] <Eviltwin> BaconJuice: "Arno Boat Tour"?
[08:13:40] <BaconJuice> yes
[08:13:40] <kborchers> stede: sorry missing ; after alert
[08:13:52] <BaconJuice> Eviltwin: how do I read just that
[08:14:08] <Eviltwin> data.trips[1].name
[08:14:50] <kborchers> you have to define a callback, not just provide code to execute. you would need a similar function definition for complete as well
[08:15:14] <SergSergiu> Element referenced by ID/NAME in the global scope. Use W3C standard document.getElementById() instead.
[08:15:18] <SergSergiu> ex1 is not a function
[08:15:40] <SergSergiu> :'
[08:16:18] <Barbie> Hi #jquery, I've a small problem.. When I do $tabber.tabs ("option", "selected"), i get an error TypeError: a[b] is undefined somwhere in ui.tabs.pack.js
[08:16:19] <BaconJuice> Eviltwin: doesn't work?
[08:16:43] <stede> kborchers, why that isnt documented on the jquery.com in the .ajax doc o_O
[08:17:21] <kborchers> it is http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ and scroll down to error
[08:18:33] <mwcarroll> I have content that's being loaded through ajax that I then need to apply .mask() to, $(document).ready(function(){…}); isn't working for it… anyone have any suggestions?
[08:18:49] <kborchers> stede: and if you scroll down to the explanation of the jqXHR object, there is a simple example
[08:18:53] <Eviltwin> BaconJuice: http://jsfiddle.net/ZkAXZ/1/
[08:19:09] <stede> kborchers, Eviltwin: however, i want to use .post .. so i should look hoe to prepare data to use .post
[08:19:09] <Eviltwin> If the data is fetched correctly as JSON, it works
[08:19:22] <stede> kborchers, note: that dont fix anything
[08:19:24] <Eviltwin> stede: .post is a shortcut for a call to .ajax
[08:19:36] <mwcarroll> http://jsfiddle.net/VPY8w/ <- it works there, but the content isn't loaded through ajax
[08:19:54] <stede> Eviltwin, yes ... how to prepare post data for the "data:" field?
[08:20:05] <kborchers> stede: .post does not provide an error callback either so if you need that, you need to use .ajax
[08:21:10] <kborchers> stede: that is wrong ... i was a little confused by the docs. the definition doesn't show it as an option but you can use the error callback
[08:21:12] <Eviltwin> stede: As an actual object is best
[08:21:56] <Eviltwin> var postData = {}; postData['ident'] = 'rfweb'; ... postData[$(thisChild).attr('name')] = $(thisChild).val(); ...
[08:22:23] <Eviltwin> stede: Does that make sense?
[08:22:34] <pissypaw> where can i find out about creating a custom event and then how to listen for it?
[08:23:02] <Eviltwin> pissypaw: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/ http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[08:23:11] <krogant> hi
[08:23:25] <krogant> if i want to delay setting an attribute on an element, how do i do it?
[08:23:31] <stede> Eviltwin, kborchers, honestly may be its better to use .ajax instead of the alias .post?!
[08:24:06] <krogant> something like sleep(500); $('#foo').attr('name', 'value');?
[08:24:15] <Eviltwin> stede: This shows you exactly what it sends to $.ajax: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[08:24:32] <Eviltwin> krogant: There is no notion of "sleep" in JavaScript however you can set a timeout
[08:24:44] <Eviltwin> krogant: Have you done asynchronous or event-driven programming before?
[08:25:06] <krogant> Eviltwin: only with the ajax get and post methods
[08:25:17] <krogant> Eviltwin: i've done a bit of c# too
[08:26:18] <daninma> hey fellas. i am workign on a bookmarklet for myself. the first thing it does is load jquery if it not present. can somone suggest how I make the rest of the script "wait" to proceed until jquery is loaded?
[08:26:37] <ajpiano> daninma http://benalman.com/projects/run-jquery-code-bookmarklet/
[08:26:56] <ajpiano> krogant: setTimeout(function() { $("foo").attr("bar", "baz");   }, 500);
[08:27:07] <krogant> thanks ajpiano
[08:27:12] <Eviltwin> krogant: http://pastebin.com/KfZCXUvr
[08:28:45] <daninma> that should do it ty
[08:29:03] <krogant> thanks Eviltwin
[08:31:35] <GreyTrilby> @ajpiano - following our earlier chat (read: you telling me what a crap coder I am), do you think I should do this via php instead?
[08:31:43] <ajpiano> no, not at all
[08:32:08] <ajpiano> i'm not sure how doing it in php is even an option
[08:32:23] <GreyTrilby> heh - neither was I, but I thought I'd have a go :)
[08:32:28] <ajpiano> GreyTrilby http://jsfiddle.net/zcsb9/2/
[08:33:19] <GreyTrilby> I did wonder if it would be as simple as chaining that much!
[08:34:00] <ajpiano> GreyTrilby http://jsfiddle.net/zcsb9/3/ will start back at the beginning when it reaches the end
[08:35:05] <GreyTrilby> @ajpiano - nice!
[08:35:47] <GreyTrilby> @ajpiano - just one small thing - which might explain the route I was planning on taking - I want it to "play" automatically using setTimeOut()
[08:36:20] <GreyTrilby> but I want the interval to be correct, so if there are 3 minutes between posts, it would be 3 mins between the refresh (as if it were a live streaming blog)
[08:36:46] <GreyTrilby> to do that I need the minute of the next item when the previous item does its show()
[08:37:46] <GreyTrilby> @ajpiano - but gimme a minute - I wanna see if I can work it out myself
[08:37:56] <ajpiano> yeah, please do :)
[08:37:59] <ajpiano> i gotta get to real work
[08:38:07] <GreyTrilby> pah - that's no fun!
[08:38:18] <GreyTrilby> thanks (again!) for your help!
[08:38:28] <GreyTrilby> i'm learning much from you!
[08:38:35] <ajpiano> :)
[08:38:49] <ajpiano> one of these days you're gonna need to hook me up with an actual grey trilby
[08:38:57] <codecowboy> HI. I have an object value (diary.countValue) which I want to 'watch' for changes. It can change based on a user making an ajax call to add an item to a calendar. If the countValue goes up, I want to reflect that in another div. Whats the best method of doing this?
[08:39:18] <GreyTrilby> I got mine from Tie Rack - had been searching for months to find just the 'right' one...
[08:39:36] <GreyTrilby> Found it in Manchester of all places - go figure
[08:39:47] <ajpiano> codecowboy: you can't really make an object observable unless you like, create an API around updating its attributes then fire events when those APIs are used, a la Backbone
[08:40:03] <ajpiano> heh, i got my trilby in west london somewhere
[08:41:03] <GreyTrilby> not that place near ladbroke grove?
[08:41:29] <codecowboy> ajpiano:  hmm, ok. But if the count is updated based on an ajax call, I could fire an event then ?
[08:41:36] <ajpiano> ostensibly, yes
[08:42:28] <codecowboy> ajpiano:  ostensibly = Apparently or purportedly, but perhaps not actually. So what are you saying ;-)
[08:44:19] * GreyTrilby tips his hat to ajpiano and bids adieu to all
[08:44:31] <GreyTrilby> \exit
[08:49:31] <gaspar|work> Hye guys, I am having problems with super simple script on my page for internet exporer 8. Site address is jjroofingandconstruction.com and I am rewriting it from a terrible, terrible state it's now in.
[08:49:59] <jeffsmykil> am I a moron
[08:50:00] <jeffsmykil> $("#MainContent_TagText").focus();
[08:50:05] <jeffsmykil> thats formatted right?
[08:50:20] <gaspar|work> Super simple drop-down menu I have works fine in FF, Chrome, Safari and Opera but not IE 8 - and it's not consistent in how it fails.
[08:51:05] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Looks right to me
[08:51:42] <ajpiano> gaspar|work: you realise that page is throwing a syntax error in ie8 right
[08:51:51] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: yeah I know right?
[08:51:53] <gaspar|work> ajpiano: How do I check it?
[08:52:02] <ajpiano> use the ie developer tools?
[08:52:05] <ajpiano> press f12
[08:52:25] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: no error, not working either though
[08:52:44] <Eviltwin> gaspar|work: That is...pretty wrong: http://pastebin.com/jm97ZhCk
[08:52:57] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: What's $("#MainContent_TagText").length
[08:53:17] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: good idea
[08:53:35] <stede> Eviltwin, kborchers: i've made it ... only thing is the error handlig .. i will check it now ...
[08:53:35] <gaspar|work> Eviltwin: I just started redoing this site. I'm wlowly removing bad code so I won't break anything.
[08:54:08] <Eviltwin> gaspar|work: <!-- does not parse in JavaScript
[08:54:58] <jeffsmykil> the lengthi is 1
[08:55:12] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: What type of tag is it?
[08:55:37] <jeffsmykil> in browser it is an input
[08:56:02] <Bower^> http://jsfiddle.net/9Whae/ - I need the .click() method called within displayAlbums() to use the value of i when passed the function, not the value of i when it is invoked. What shall I read into?
[08:56:02] <jeffsmykil> in f**** up ASP land it is a textbox
[08:56:02] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Are you doing this in the page?
[08:56:15] <jeffsmykil> im doing it on page load eviltwin
[08:56:38] <Eviltwin> So $(document).ready(function() { $("#MainContent_TagText").focus() }) or something?
[08:56:48] <jeffsmykil> yupp
[08:57:08] <ajpiano> Bower^: you need to *not use a for loop*
[08:57:18] <ajpiano> or read the link i sent you earlier
[08:57:25] <ajpiano> about how the scope persists in for loops
[08:57:32] <ajpiano> after the loop has concluded
[08:57:47] <Bower^> I didn't understand the code man but I don't wanna just copy/paste my way to victory
[08:57:53] <Bower^> and*
[08:57:56] <ajpiano> well
[08:57:59] <jeffsmykil> thats how the romans did it
[08:58:13] <ajpiano> read your way to victory
[08:58:30] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: it shouldnt matter if the input is pre-populated, should it?
[08:58:32] <Bower^> My brain won't let me :(
[08:58:34] <Bower^> silly brain
[08:59:01] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: At the place where that line is currently, can you try alert($("#MainContent_TagText").length) just to be sure it's there at load?
[08:59:12] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: it is
[08:59:13] <jeffsmykil> I get a 1
[08:59:24] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Secondarily, certain browsers have weird behavior when attempting to focus immediately at load
[08:59:32] <Eviltwin> Try wrapping it with setTimeout(function() { ... }, 0)
[08:59:53] <Bower^> Maybe if that code you posted worked ajpiano I could piece together what it's doing..eventually
[09:00:09] <ajpiano> the code i pasted had nothing to do with the iterator persistence
[09:00:13] <ajpiano> that you're experiencing
[09:00:16] <ajpiano> i didn't even attempt to fix that
[09:00:17] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: setTimeout(function () { $("#MainContent_TagText").focus(); }, 0)
[09:00:42] <stede> okay ... and why $.ajax() dont call success: function( data ) { .. } after sucessfully loaded the server script?
[09:01:08] <Eviltwin> Bower^: Try: http://jsfiddle.net/9Whae/1/
[09:01:12] <gaspar|work> Eviltwin: OK, I removed that stupid non-parsing element. Still not working entirely correct.
[09:02:17] <Bower^> That works, thanks man
[09:02:23] <Bower^> What exactly did you change
[09:02:40] <Eviltwin> Inside var displayAlbums inside v
[09:02:41] <Eviltwin> for(i = 0; albums[i] !== undefined; i++){
[09:02:47] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: It works on a different input element on the same page, wtf
[09:02:53] <Eviltwin> I added (function(i) { ... })(i); around that block
[09:03:02] <Eviltwin> That function creates a new scope so the i persists in the callback
[09:03:16] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: I don't know what to say
[09:03:18] <Eviltwin> Browsers are weird
[09:03:28] <jeffsmykil> indeed
[09:03:43] <jeffsmykil> You could tell my QA guy that.... Eviltwin
[09:03:57] <Eviltwin> You can quote me
[09:04:00] <jeffsmykil> hehe
[09:04:13] <jeffsmykil> some guy named Eviltwin says browsers are weird and to leave me alone
[09:04:30] <jeffsmykil> i adlibbed there
[09:04:56] <Eviltwin> I don't think the QA guy should leave you alone. I think he should have you write a new browser
[09:05:21] <jeffsmykil> he can barely qa what we give him
[09:05:23] <Bower^> Eviltwin, what's up with tje second pair of "()" for function(i){}(i)
[09:05:26] <jeffsmykil> a browser would be a nigth mare
[09:05:34] <stede> someone can help with my .ajax-call? i dont understand how success:/error:/complete: works correctly! http://pastebin.com/WEdd6VRX
[09:05:43] <Eviltwin> Bower^: That means to run the function right now with i as the only paramater
[09:05:49] <Eviltwin> parameter*
[09:06:05] <Bower^> Hmm. Could you possibly reword that?
[09:06:46] <Eviltwin> Bower^: I am defining a new anonymous function there (function without a name) and then I am calling it with i
[09:07:10] <Bower^> I see
[09:07:16] <Dr4g1> Guys im lookin for a crop tool that I can specify the aspect ratio on the crop element.
[09:07:18] <Bower^> Why does i persist though?
[09:07:27] <Eviltwin> Because functions create a new scope
[09:07:41] <Dr4g1> I don't want users to select custom dimensions, because when i create thumbnails I don't want them to be all skewed up.
[09:07:43] <Eviltwin> And the i that's inside is actually the i from function(i) {
[09:07:51] <Dr4g1> Can you guys recommend one(or a few?)
[09:07:53] <Dr4g1> -
[09:07:56] <Bower^> Interesting Eviltwin
[09:08:13] <Bower^> Is this the closure business?
[09:08:26] <Eviltwin> Yes
[09:08:32] <Bower^> Sweet
[09:08:46] <Bower^> Eviltwin, you're a star. Thanks a lot mate
[09:08:52] <Eviltwin> No problem
[09:09:14] <necromancer> Bower^: not really.
[09:09:20] <necromancer> it's not a closure, it's a self-executing function
[09:09:28] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: my hypothesis is ASP is doing something weird like adding the value after the page loads, because the value isn't actually in the aspx file
[09:09:35] <Eviltwin> necromancer: The closure is what creates the new scope
[09:09:37] <Eviltwin> That's what closure is
[09:09:49] <necromancer> yeah
[09:10:01] <Bower^> Yeah. If that isn't closure then I'm not sure how it holds onto the value of i
[09:11:07] <stede> why success: of my ajax request was not called altough the serverside script returns with 200-ok ?
[09:11:10] <Eviltwin> Bower^: It uses closure :P
[09:11:15] <Bower^> :)
[09:12:29] <tbranyen> stede: cross domain?
[09:12:31] <necromancer> haha
[09:12:31] <necromancer> wow
[09:12:39] <necromancer> Eviltwin: i totally missed that `i` in there :)
[09:12:42] <stede> tbranyen, no
[09:12:53] <thomb> how can i connect a jquery function to a div element which was delivered within an ajax request?
[09:13:12] <jeffsmykil> necromancer do you play "Real of the Mad God?:
[09:13:14] <tbranyen> stede: hrm
[09:13:20] <stede> tbranyen, like this: http://pastebin.com/WEdd6VRX
[09:13:20] <tbranyen> stede: does complete event trigger?
[09:13:29] <stede> let me check that
[09:13:38] <StevenBlack> thomb: check out .delegate()
[09:13:53] <Bower^> Eviltwin, any thoughts on the style of code in general? I'm interested in seemingly experienced people's opinions on good practice
[09:14:12] <Bower^> you too necro
[09:14:28] <thomb> StevenBlack: looks good ;) thank you. i'll try it
[09:14:32] <Bower^> Started JS a few days ago now
[09:14:43] <stede> tbranyen, can i do it like this: complete: function(){ alert('complete'); },  if yes -> dont see any alert
[09:14:45] <Bower^> Feel like I'm getting a feel for it now but I don't wanna pick up bad habits
[09:16:13] <Eviltwin> Bower^: If it works, be happy. You're pretty new to the language
[09:17:17] <aaronw-1> is tehrea a jquery validate plugin that can validate against IP addresses?
[09:17:38] <brugby> um, wouldn't that be more server side?
[09:18:46] <Bower^> Fair point Eviltwin. I guess if it contained anything majorly wrong you'd mention it
[09:18:50] <Bower^> Well thanks
[09:19:27] <stede> tbranyen, may it affected by dataType: "json" ?
[09:19:58] <tbranyen> stede: perhaps
[09:20:02] <tbranyen> but the error event should be thrown
[09:21:03] <stede> i define a simple alert know for each (success/error/complete) and no one of these is thron, and no errors in java console and in firebug i can see the request is complete with 200-ok and returns the json-string i expected
[09:21:10] <stede> -confused-
[09:21:13] <listrophy> I've added a css attribute via css(obj)... how can I remove that inline definition later?
[09:23:08] <listrophy> ah... empty string does the trick. odd that neither undefined, null, nor false work that way
[09:23:25] <stede> tbranyen, got it! i can not use function(data) - but function(dataa)
[09:24:01] <tbranyen> thats weird stede
[09:24:18] <tbranyen> stede: also you're using $.jsonParse... no idea if thats a plugin or something, but its $.parseJSON
[09:24:26] <aaronw-1> ccmonster, why?
[09:24:40] <stede> tbranyen, may be that is the point
[09:24:43] <aaronw-1> jquery validate can validate email addreses "legality"
[09:24:47] <aaronw-1> why not an ip address ?
[09:24:49] <Bower^> Anyone with FF and the WD add-on that is willing to test a jquery bug quickly?
[09:24:55] <stede> tbranyen, but i've got ne error that this function wont exists
[09:24:59] <ccmonster> email addresses are done via regex I believe
[09:25:01] <aaronw-1> 4 fields, separated by periods, each field < 255
[09:25:17] <ccmonster> ah||, you just want a surface check like that
[09:25:22] <aaronw-1> yes
[09:25:30] <ccmonster> in that case, you can probably write your own custom one
[09:25:41] <Eviltwin> Is jsFiddle scope smart?
[09:25:43] <aaronw-1> the same way jquery validate plugin "cehcks" for CC numbers, email addresses, etc
[09:25:44] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/wgRnY/
[09:25:44] <ccmonster> and why is anyone putting their ip address in ?
[09:25:52] <Eviltwin> It's coloring the j's in dark blue instead of black
[09:25:58] <aaronw-1> ccmonster, to build an access control list
[09:26:07] <ccmonster> hmm, internal tool?
[09:26:11] <aaronw-1> ccmonster, yes
[09:26:18] <Eviltwin> aaronw-1: A CC number can be checked for typos via a Luhn sum and length check
[09:26:24] <aaronw-1> Eviltwin, yes I know
[09:26:51] <aaronw-1> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation#List_of_built-in_Validation_methods
[09:27:18] <aaronw-1> all I'm wondering if there's a jquery plguin I can send a form submit field to, and have it return 'yes' or 'no' is it an ip address
[09:27:25] <aaronw-1> similar to what that plugin does for CC numbers
[09:27:26] <ccmonster> \b(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\b
[09:27:41] <ccmonster> there you go, huge regex beast for IPs
[09:27:56] <aaronw-1> if you find youreself writing a huge regexp, you're doing it wrong!
[09:27:58] <aaronw-1> (tm)
[09:28:00] <Bower^> http://jsfiddle.net/TUSMq/ , http://jsfiddle.net/TUSMq/1, http://jsfiddle.net/TUSMq/3 . Can someone with FF and the WD add-on please run those three HTML files on a webserver (not directly from fiddle) and tell me if you receive any CSS validation errors
[09:28:32] <Eviltwin> ccmonster: Look into regex {1,2}
[09:28:34] <listrophy> ccmonster: there are edge cases that fail with that (i presume)
[09:28:36] <Bower^> It seems there's a bug with 1.6.2 if you place the <script> element near the closing <body> element
[09:28:37] <Cork[home]> ccmonster: problem is that one only works for ip4 ;P
[09:28:39] <aaronw-1> ccmonster, how does that take 010.005.222.101 ?
[09:28:41] <Eviltwin> ccmonster: And regex {4}
[09:28:53] <ccmonster> lol Cork, tru
[09:29:24] <ccmonster> if you want ip checks, it's easier to split, and check honestly.
[09:29:36] <aaronw-1> split?
[09:29:50] <listrophy> for example, it accepts 127.0.0.1, which is probably unintended
[09:29:50] <ccmonster> it's period delimited, so to speak.
[09:29:50] <gho5t> Has anyone used jqgrid and had success with the subgrid expandOnLoad option?
[09:29:59] <Eviltwin> '128.135.91.1'.split(/\./) == ["128", "135", "91", "1"]
[09:30:04] <ccmonster> bingo evil :)
[09:30:09] <Eviltwin> Or '128.135.91.1'.split('.')
[09:30:14] <ccmonster> even better :)
[09:30:20] <ccmonster> +1 for jquery'ness
[09:30:25] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[09:30:28] <Eviltwin> No jQuery there
[09:30:32] <aaronw-1> listrophy, well, it depends how much client side validation one should do
[09:30:33] <listrophy> that's ruby
[09:30:34] <Eviltwin> That's JavaScript
[09:30:42] <Bower^> Looks like Java :P
[09:30:58] <Eviltwin> Doesn't Java use single quotes for chars like C does?
[09:31:13] <ccmonster> it cert isnt java.
[09:31:22] <ccmonster> man, it's been that long I forgot the split method is native js.
[09:31:24] <stede> tbranyen, and how can i use the object parseJSON returns? obj.fieldname wont work
[09:31:24] * ccmonster fail
[09:31:34] <listrophy> aaronw-1: yes, but if you're writing that big of a regexp, you might as well write a function that takes into account /some/ edge cases... and if that was the case, i wouldn't use that big of a regexp
[09:31:41] <Eviltwin> ccmonster fail
[09:31:48] <ccmonster> lol total fail
[09:32:11] <aaronw-1> I'd just use someone else's regex!
[09:32:22] <ccmonster> well, then you've already seen it
[09:32:27] <ccmonster> it's gonna fail on some stuff
[09:32:36] <ccmonster> as other mentioned
[09:32:36] <aaronw-1> http://www.devcurry.com/2010/04/validate-ip-address-using-jquery.html
[09:32:44] <Bower^> Eviltwin, .split() in java takes a string
[09:32:47] <aaronw-1> there's one
[09:32:52] <aaronw-1> similar to yours
[09:32:53] <Eviltwin> Bower^: But the input uses single quotes
[09:33:02] <Eviltwin> The string input
[09:33:05] <ccmonster> ah||, an actual checker. Good stuff
[09:33:07] <ccmonster> lunch
[09:33:17] <Bower^> You can use .split(".");
[09:33:20] <gho5t> Has anyone used jqgrid and had success with the subgrid expandOnLoad option?
[09:33:42] <Eviltwin> Bower^: Compile this in Java: '128.135.91.1'.split('.')
[09:33:47] <Eviltwin> Doubt it will work
[09:33:48] <ccmonster> fail.
[09:33:50] <halcyon1234> Having some issues with .live, and I would hazard a guess I'm using it wrong:  http://jsfiddle.net/mYqtz/
[09:33:56] <halcyon1234> Works: $(".test").live("keyup", something)
[09:33:59] <halcyon1234> Doesn't work: $(".test").each(function() { $(this).live("keyup", Something) })
[09:34:03] <aaronw-1> I think I'll just do it srever side totally:
[09:34:04] <aaronw-1> http://www.php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.validate.php
[09:34:28] <Bower^> Ah, sorry I misunderstood
[09:34:43] <Bower^> yeah you couldn't encase a string in ' with java
[09:34:44] <gaspar|work> OK, I have rewritten parts of my page (it validates now) and yet super simple drop-down menu does not work right in IE. Address is http://www.jjroofingandconstruction.com
[09:35:01] <Eviltwin> halcyon1234: Try using bind for the ones in the .each
[09:35:04] <cbobo> How can I edit attributes, if I am selecting from an .each?
[09:35:10] <gaspar|work> I suspect IE definition of .parent() being wrong, but I don't know how to fix it.
[09:35:25] <Eviltwin> gaspar|work: IE doesn't define .parent(), jQuery does
[09:35:41] <cbobo> example: $('.myclass').each(function(i,e) { this.attr('checked','checked'); });
[09:35:52] <halcyon1234> Eviltwin:  $(this).keyup would work, but the problem is I need the functionality of .live.
[09:35:53] <cbobo> ^ Above does not work
[09:35:59] <gaspar|work> Eviltwin: I'm sorry, what I mean is that .parent might be interpeted in a different way in IE
[09:36:24] <Eviltwin> halcyon1234: Calling .live in an .each doesn't make a whole lot of sense
[09:36:47] <Know1edge> anyone have a script to play wav/mp3s on click?
[09:36:56] <John_Dee> http://jsfiddle.net/pXYnw/4/ - can someone explain why the appended elements aren't fading in?
[09:37:58] <ajpiano> halcyon1234: you can only call live directly against a selector, not against an arbitrary collection (like $(this))
[09:38:02] <halcyon1234> Eviltwin: I'm trying to write a plugin that uses live. In the plugin, I'm using return $(this).each(function() { ... stuff... $(this).live("keyup", ....) }
[09:38:17] <ajpiano> you should use delegate instead
[09:38:37] <halcyon1234> ajpiano: Ah, that makes sense.  I'll look into delegate. Thanks.
[09:43:44] <Eviltwin> So who's still got problems? :P
[09:44:46] <tomkane> Is this the place where I can ask jquery/ajax questions, esp. jquery.form.js issues?
[09:45:06] <Eviltwin> tomkane: This is the place for jQuery at least
[09:45:23] <Eviltwin> Not sure if there's a place specifically for jquery.form.js
[09:45:27] <stede> why i cant map kydown() event to another event function i defined (change() in this case)?
[09:45:32] <thefalling> Tryin to use this $('#shipCell0314568BEDF01').easyTooltip('displayShip' + ($(this).attr('id').substring(15)));     but im getting this error: $(this).attr("id") is undefined. any suggestions?
[09:45:55] <Eviltwin> stede: .keydown(function(){$(this).change()}) ?
[09:46:01] <stede> Eviltwin, yeah
[09:46:03] <stede> like: http://pastebin.com/ttdiLaf3
[09:46:12] <stede> i wont repeate the code
[09:46:30] <tomkane> Eviltwin: Are there regular users who work with ajax?
[09:46:31] <Eviltwin> Try $(".trackChanges").trigger("change");
[09:46:37] <stede> and onchange dont fire if i click in an input and start typing
[09:46:44] <Eviltwin> tomkane: Yes
[09:47:07] <Ogredude> I need some best practice advice.  I've got a form that's got some fields that need to be exposed on such-and-such action, and some other fields that get exposed on such-and-such-other action...  Is it better to put the fields into the document and set them hidden with CSS, and unhide them with jquery, or is it better to have jquery write them into the document as needed?
[09:47:08] <Eviltwin> thefalling: We need a little more context
[09:47:24] <Eviltwin> Ogredude: I recommend the former
[09:47:35] <BaconJuice> http://jsfiddle.net/EXRcj/ any idea why its not showing when I click the first cat
[09:47:46] <ajpiano> thefalling: there's no 'this' there
[09:47:52] <stede> Eviltwin, $(".trackChanges input").trigger("change"); dont work
[09:48:07] <Eviltwin> stede: That's not what you're binding to though
[09:48:07] <ajpiano> thefalling: you have to do an .each(fn) loop to get the element you just selected as 'this'
[09:48:31] <Ogredude> ok good, that's the way I'm doing it.
[09:48:38] <stede> lol
[09:48:38] <thefalling> ajpiano: how would i do that?
[09:48:43] <Ogredude> Now, I guess I just need to figure out how to get Capybara to tell whether an element is hidden or not
[09:48:44] <Eviltwin> Ogredude: Be sure to avoid http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content
[09:49:20] <Eviltwin> stede: Don't you need to do $(".trackChanges").trigger("change") not $(".trackChanges input").trigger("change")?
[09:49:28] <stede> Eviltwin, you mean: $(".trackChanges input").keydown("change");
[09:49:36] <Eviltwin> No.... not at all...
[09:49:47] <Ogredude> Eviltwin:  that article describes what it is, but not how to avoid it.  Have any good resources on how to avoid FOUC?
[09:50:17] <Eviltwin> Ogredude: In this case, I'd probably have a style="display:none" in the tag you want to hide
[09:50:23] <Eviltwin> To be sure that it won't be shown
[09:50:30] <kborchers> BaconJuice: at a minimum among other issues, you're missing a closing } at the end. use the console/firebug see ?alert
[09:50:30] <bot-t1> BaconJuice, Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[09:50:42] <stede> Eviltwin, no ... i have change trigger on all my form fields (input,textarea,select) and track changes with it. but change with in input field was triggerd once i leave the input field, but not on valuechange/keydown
[09:50:55] <John_Dee> any ideas why .fadeIn() isn't working after the elements are appendedTo? — http://jsfiddle.net/pXYnw/4/
[09:50:55] <ajpiano> Ogredude http://paulirish.com/2009/avoiding-the-fouc-v3/
[09:51:13] <Eviltwin> stede: The code you pasted has $(".trackChanges").change(
[09:51:17] <stede> Eviltwin, therefore i want to fire change too if an input-filed fires keydown
[09:51:31] <kborchers> John_Dee: because they're already visible. hide first
[09:51:33] <ajpiano> John_Dee, they need to be hidden by default, otherwise they are already visible and you can't fade 'em in
[09:51:36] <Eviltwin> So I'm advocating $(".trackChanges").trigger("change")
[09:51:42] <stede> Eviltwin, yes ant it goes to its child(0) which is always a form field of different kind
[09:51:49] <BaconJuice> http://jsfiddle.net/EXRcj/1/ still not working kborchers
[09:51:49] <John_Dee> Ahh. Thank you, both of you.
[09:52:21] <stede> Eviltwin, because trackChanges is set to the parent nodes of the form-field (which actually are td's)
[09:52:22] <thefalling> ajpiano: i have multiple displayship divs, so how would i know when to stop the iteration? im lost
[09:52:40] <stede> Eviltwin, and i wont registrate keydown to the td
[09:52:51] <ajpiano> why would you stop the iteration
[09:53:17] <Ogredude> ajpiano:  thanks
[09:53:23] <ajpiano> $(".tooltipThingie").each(function() { $(this).crazyTooltip("foo" + this.id);    });
[09:53:27] <stede> Eviltwin, and before asking why i dont set the class to the form elements itselfs ... its because of smarty ;)
[09:54:05] <kborchers> BaconJuice: if you look at the errors being spit out in the console like i told you to do, you can see what's wrong. florancecost is not defined which is because you are defining it in the window.load function scope. change onLoad to no wrap (head)
[09:54:31] <BaconJuice> kborchers: no errors
[09:55:00] <kborchers> Chrome console: Uncaught ReferenceError: florancecost is not defined
[09:56:02] <BaconJuice> I dont see this in console
[09:56:13] <stede> Eviltwin, ok ... i use bind() to trigger on two events ... but keypress fires only at second hit on key ?!
[09:56:16] <BaconJuice> so what do i need to do now?
[09:56:23] <kborchers> Firebug: florancecost is not defined
[09:57:11] <kborchers> and i told you what to do to fix it ^^^
[09:59:38] <BaconJuice> window.load function scope. change onLoad to no wrap (head)
[09:59:39] <thefalling> ty ajpiano
[09:59:44] <BaconJuice> can you rephrase this? I dont understand
[10:01:07] <stede> how to check if $(".foo") matches NO elemetns?
[10:01:16] <tbranyen> i haven't heard of jqgrid in ages
[10:01:43] <ngharo> stede: check .length
[10:01:48] <kborchers> BaconJuice: in jsfiddle, you have your javascript set to run onLoad (see the select menu in the upper left hand corner). that wraps your js in a window.load(function() { ... }) call, thus your florancecost function is defined within that function. if you change "onLoad" to "no wrap (head)", it will put your js in script tags in the head of the document
[10:02:05] <stede> ngharo, tahts dont work, because if no elements exists no jquery object returned
[10:02:20] <stede> ngharo, oops
[10:02:21] <stede> sry
[10:02:23] <stede> it does
[10:02:24] <Cork[home]> stede: jquery always returns it self :)
[10:03:01] <BaconJuice> but how do i solve this with my file?
[10:03:32] <g0bl1n> should I use an ajax call to get a page that returns a pdf file ? jQuery.ajax(url) doesn't return the pdf because at the end I do return false ??
[10:04:11] <g0bl1n> yet I see the framework processes the request...
[10:04:23] <Cork[home]> g0bl1n: a pdf returned over ajax, won't trigger a download or the plugin
[10:04:30] <Cork[home]> so you most likly don'
[10:04:41] <Cork[home]> *t want to do it that way
[10:04:53] <kborchers> BaconJuice: i would have to see your file to answer that. link?
[10:05:04] <g0bl1n> Cork[home], should I request a page ?
[10:05:06] <BaconJuice> well I have my js file seperate
[10:05:19] <BaconJuice> and running that code in a regular old document load
[10:05:32] <BaconJuice> $(document).ready(function() {
[10:05:32] <BaconJuice> function florancecost(){
[10:05:32] <BaconJuice> 	if ($('input[id=radio-choice-1]:checked')) {
[10:05:32] <BaconJuice>     // do something here
[10:05:32] <BaconJuice> 	alert("vsrv");
[10:05:32] <BaconJuice> 	}
[10:05:32] <BaconJuice> }
[10:05:33] <BaconJuice> });
[10:05:44] <kborchers> BaconJuice: don't paste code here
[10:05:52] <BaconJuice> http://jsfiddle.net/EXRcj/2/
[10:05:55] <BaconJuice> yea sorry
[10:06:06] <Cork[home]> g0bl1n: either through window.localtion, a tags or iframe ya
[10:06:16] <Cork[home]> (window.open works too)
[10:06:28] <kborchers> don't define a function inside of document.ready
[10:06:46] <g0bl1n> Cork[home], trying that ;)
[10:07:08] <Cork[home]> kborchers: as long as you only use it in the event its fine
[10:07:50] <Foxandxss> what the best, i mean, a good and easy one grid for jquery?
[10:07:52] <Foxandxss> jqgrid?
[10:08:06] <kborchers> Cork[home] ?
[10:08:15] <Cork[home]> Foxandxss: there isn't too many options
[10:08:41] <Cork[home]> kborchers: a function defined inside the ready event will work inside the event, so if you only need it there; its fine
[10:08:54] <kborchers> he's calling it from onclick in an element
[10:08:57] <Foxandxss> Cork[home], so I will look at jqgrid
[10:09:05] <Cork[home]> kborchers: ouch
[10:10:44] <BaconJuice> kborchers: even after removing it from there still wont show the popup
[10:11:23] <g0bl1n> Cork[home], window.location works with a warning Resource interpreted as Document but transferred with MIME type application/pdf.
[10:11:48] <kborchers> BaconJuice: without seeing your page, not sure what more i can do
[10:12:36] <ajpiano> g0bl1n: you gotta put some content-disposition headers on that pdf when you serve it bac
[10:14:28] <stede> sooo .. last question for today ... how to unbind/rebind a function to click event?
[10:14:45] <stede> bind('click',"funcname"); gives java errors
[10:15:13] <kborchers> ?bind @ stede
[10:15:14] <bot-t1> stede, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[10:15:19] <kborchers> ?unbind @ stede
[10:15:20] <bot-t1> stede, .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[10:15:26] <ajpiano> stede a string that is the name of a function is not the same as a function
[10:15:43] <stede> actually not
[10:16:16] <g0bl1n> ajpiano, I'm getting a application/pdf
[10:16:32] <g0bl1n> in the headers
[10:16:32] <BaconJuice> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/EXRcj/3/ here is my code
[10:17:08] <g0bl1n> ajpiano, chrome tells me: Content-Type:application/pdf
[10:17:28] <ajpiano> g0bl1n, i'm saying what you have to *set*
[10:17:38] <stede> by all and thanks for help
[10:17:41] <ajpiano> on the server
[10:18:22] <g0bl1n> ajpiano, yes, it is set on the server and the response headers include that content-type. Window.location would expect a document other than that content-type ?
[10:19:36] <ajpiano> a content-disposition header??
[10:19:45] <ajpiano> i'm not talking about only content type
[10:19:59] <g0bl1n> oh, content-disposition ? ok
[10:20:14] <ajpiano> http://www.jtricks.com/bits/content_disposition.html
[10:20:15] <g0bl1n> ajpiano, thanks
[10:20:26] <ajpiano> :)
[10:20:32] <BaconJuice> ajpiano: could you help me out next?
[10:20:33] <BaconJuice> http://jsfiddle.net/EXRcj/3/
[10:20:36] <ajpiano> probably not
[10:20:40] <BaconJuice> the popup when I click don't show =(
[10:20:42] <ajpiano> i saw your code :p
[10:20:48] <BaconJuice> dammit
[10:20:58] <ajpiano> BaconJuice: there is like, a lot "wrong" here so to speak
[10:21:13] <kborchers> heh ... that's what i said about 30 min ago
[10:21:13] <g0bl1n> ajpiano, you'r awesome! :-)
[10:21:20] <ajpiano> so it's a heavy undertaking for anyone :/
[10:21:31] <BaconJuice> dam
[10:21:59] <BaconJuice> I mean shouldnt it be simple?
[10:22:05] <BaconJuice> when I click a radio button show a popup?
[10:22:07] <ajpiano> it is simple
[10:22:16] <BaconJuice> how come it doesn't work here then?
[10:22:26] <ajpiano> if you know the fundamentals of "how to write jQuery"
[10:22:37] <ajpiano> because of numerous errors in your implementation :/
[10:22:49] <BaconJuice> can you tell me what the errors are?
[10:22:53] <BaconJuice> so I can "learn"
[10:23:14] <ajpiano> 1) you're using inline events, which is why it isn't finding the function you think you've defined globally - you haven't actually defined it globally
[10:23:23] <ajpiano> you should bind handlers in jquery using .bind
[10:23:27] <thefalling> ajpiano: just found a bug in my code, i use ajax to go to the next page in the table, so it creates the new table, but that doesnt work with the model i currently have. Should i use .live? if so how exactly would i do that?
[10:23:40] <ajpiano> like $("input:radio").change(function() { }):
[10:23:49] <ajpiano> instead of having this global florancecost functiont hing
[10:24:13] <ajpiano> BaconJuice: another problem is that if ($("anyjQuerySelector")) { } will always be true
[10:24:23] <ajpiano> because it just returns an empty jquery object, which is what we call "truthy" in javascript
[10:24:32] <ajpiano> if you want to test if a set has results, check it's .length
[10:24:39] <Ox41464b_> Hi, is it possible to make 'wheels-of-fortune' based on jQuery
[10:24:49] <ajpiano> thefalling: that's a bit vague
[10:24:51] <ajpiano> what doesn't work?
[10:24:52] <austen> Ugh... Too much beer yesterday!
[10:25:04] <BaconJuice> ok thanks ajpiano brb!
[10:26:49] <thefalling> ajpiano: Well since i use the .load method to reload the table with new data, the newer tables shipCells arent binded right?
[10:27:01] <ajpiano> thefalling: you should use delegate for this
[10:27:12] <ajpiano> are you reloading the entire table or just its tbody
[10:27:27] <thefalling> let me double check
[10:27:36] <ajpiano> in either case you should use delegate
[10:27:43] <ajpiano> it's just a question of which container you can delegate the events on
[10:28:16] <thefalling> i reload the div wich is the parent of the table
[10:28:22] <thefalling> a div*
[10:28:33] <ajpiano> well, basically... delegate your events to the container that actually stays in the dom the whole time :)
[10:29:01] <kborchers> BaconJuice: this simplifies your example and takes jqmobile out of the picture for now. you should get a grasp on jQuery and JavaScript before starting on mobile http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/EXRcj/5/
[10:30:54] <thefalling> k ill try it out
[10:40:39] <engaged> I am using wp audioplayer to load a bunch of mp3's into a jquery datatables. Problem is the audio files aren't loading fast enough before the datatables loads and overwrite the cell so the audio player won't load. Is there a way or some built in call back to see when the last audio player has loaded to then call the datables to be loaded?
[10:41:00] <aaronw-1> I don't understand this regex:
[10:41:05] <aaronw-1> ^((?!hidden).)*$
[10:41:59] <engaged> $(document).ready() still doesn't make sure the flash/javascript audioplayers are all done loading...
[10:42:45] <iszak> try $(window).load(fn)
[10:43:31] <engaged> ok
[10:43:32] <engaged> 1sec
[10:43:44] <t4nkd> Hey jQuery, this might be more of a js question but, I'm wondering how I can take an array of elements(e.g. ['p','a','span'] and for each element, get the current fontSize css and +1 to it. Do I have to use that "if integer" against the array length and assign a new var as the integer in my if closure?
[10:43:50] <t4nkd> Did I make sense...?
[10:44:50] <engaged> iszak: thanks buddy
[10:44:50] <iszak> $('p,a,span').each(function(){/* get font size and ad done*/});
[10:45:05] <t4nkd> Oh shit I didn't think there was a .each
[10:45:08] <t4nkd> Awesome, cool deal
[10:45:15] <iszak> ?each @ t4nkd
[10:45:15] <bot-t1> t4nkd, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[10:45:44] <ajpiano> t4nkd, you can actually implicitly iterate using .css("fontSize", function(i, fontsize) { return ++fontsize; })
[10:45:48] <ajpiano> that should actually do the entire trick
[10:45:57] <t4nkd> awseome, thanks man, glad I asked
[10:46:03] <iszak> I would just use relative font sizes.
[10:46:06] <ajpiano> unless it returns fontsize stringy there in which case you'll have to tweak
[10:46:07] <iszak> and then change it on body, but meh
[10:46:14] <ajpiano> t4nkd: fwiw, what i'd really do is actually manipulate the style rules
[10:46:15] <t4nkd> Yeah I /should/ have done that
[10:46:18] <iszak> t4nkd, is this an accessibility thing?
[10:46:21] <ajpiano> instead of touching the element's style properties at all
[10:46:26] <ajpiano> ?g jquery.rule plugin
[10:46:27] <bot-t1> ajpiano, Ariel Flesler: jQuery.Rule - http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/11/jqueryrule.html
[10:46:30] <ajpiano> it's a lot faster
[10:46:45] <ajpiano> than touching every single p, a, and span in the page
[10:47:17] <t4nkd> Yeah it's sort've a hackish last minute request, failing a long attempt at explaining accessiblity is built into the browser...
[10:47:26] <iszak> ajpiano, but with the function to css, what if the font size is % or em? or pt?
[10:47:46] <ajpiano> iszak: parseit
[10:47:49] <ajpiano> parse it*
[10:47:53] <ajpiano> ...with parseInt :D
[10:47:57] <sahilsk1> hello all. I need to run two animation on different elements to run simulataneously. is there any way to do this?
[10:48:21] <t4nkd> So many ways to manipulate my elements :0
[10:49:07] <austen> What. Happened. To. Firefox???
[10:49:33] <iszak> austen, what do you mean
[10:49:35] <austen> It used to be so nice...
[10:49:48] <austen> I'm just talking shit.
[10:49:58] <iszak> austen, they're working to improve it.
[10:50:01] <ajpiano> sahilsk1: if you put them into the same collection and call animate it, they should be synced, i believe
[10:50:13] <ajpiano> foo.add("bar").animate(opts)
[10:50:13] <austen> Debugging my script, which appears to be running 100% error free, but without producing the intended results...
[10:50:45] <austen> I *hate* debugging "blind" browser problems...
[10:50:59] <austen> Give me a symptom, ANY symptom
[10:53:36] <tbranyen> austen: those are the worst
[10:54:35] <austen> Despite needing a haircut, if my hair was long enough to get a grip on I'd be tearing it out of my head at the moment...
[10:55:03] <austen> Does anyone know of any issues with Firefox and the latest (stable) version of jQuery???
[10:55:24] <Eviltwin> Ugh, please limit yourself to one ? please
[10:55:25] <austen> It doesn't seem that any of my events are working...
[10:56:17] <Bower^> austen, I've experiened some CSS validation errors with the most recent version. It gets triggered if you load the library within the <body> as opposed to the <head>. not sure why
[10:56:20] <tbranyen> austen: run the unit test suite
[10:56:23] <tbranyen> in your browser
[10:56:28] <Bower^> it could be a browser issue though
[10:57:46] <austen> tbranyen: excellent idea!
[10:57:47] <Eviltwin> austen: Frequently problems arise when you're relying on certain behaviors that aren't officially specified by the browser
[10:58:30] <austen> Eviltwin: I have a canvas object with a "click" event...
[10:58:42] <austen> If Firefox is having an issue with that, they're doomed.
[10:59:08] <Eviltwin> Let's see code
[10:59:42] <Bower^> Eviltwin, is it ideal to encapsulate my script into a single global var?
[11:00:08] <Eviltwin> Bower^: If it's going to be used on more than one page or used as a library, yes
[11:00:17] <Eviltwin> It's possible to encapsulate your script in 0 global vars
[11:00:26] <Eviltwin> If nothing needs to call it
[11:00:45] <cerzi|work> hi all, if you use jquery to change an attribute of a certain element, and then later (without page refresh) send the value of that attribute to a server via ajax, is it supposed to send the new attribute value or the one that existed on page load?
[11:02:10] <Eviltwin> cerzi|work: Presumably the new one but could you clarify?
[11:02:31] <Bower^> encapsulate into 0 global vars?
[11:03:15] <Bower^> {script}?
[11:03:22] <Eviltwin> I'll show you
[11:03:28] <Bower^> Thanks man, appreciate it
[11:03:31] <cerzi|work> Eviltwin: well on pageload a certain hidden input has a value of "". pressing a button performs an xhr that changes that value to a long sequence of chars. pressing another button performs another xhr which sends that attribute value to the server. however, the value that arrives at the server is still ""
[11:03:40] <RoosterJuice> what's a good jquery gallery that will auto resize images?
[11:04:04] <Eviltwin> cerzi|work: Can you paste code into pastebin and share the link with us?
[11:04:09] <cerzi|work> Eviltwin: if the page is refreshed, though, the server renders the page with that new input value by default - if the same xhr button is then pressed, the server correctly receives the string
[11:04:15] <cerzi|work> Eviltwin: sure, sec
[11:04:35] <austen> Oh Thank You Asprin!
[11:05:20] <ferik2> is there another syntax for data.property ? A JSON call I make returns "this" and "that" and data.this doesn't work in all browsers because of the reserved word, I think
[11:05:57] <JKarsrud> use data['this']
[11:06:14] <JKarsrud> not sure if it will work,but give it a try :)
[11:06:55] <cerzi|work> Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/heERPCC8 - thats the main part that im concerned with, although theres also a lot of stuff server side that handles the xhr
[11:07:08] <ferik2> JKarsrud: trying. That worked!
[11:07:24] <JKarsrud> ferik2: cool
[11:09:10] <cerzi|work> actually this one adds the jquery line which changes the attr: http://pastebin.com/Xuaj1sQ2
[11:09:52] <cerzi|work> basically it just seems that the ajax sends the value of $(this).closest("form").children(".answer_key").attr("value") that existed when the page loaded, not the jquery-updated value
[11:11:32] <austen> Eviltwin: https://ideone.com/sMgon It is a simplified example of my overall script, but this functionality isn't even working...
[11:11:34] <tmba> hi, I'm struggling trying to remove class for a specific object I got using the jquery.find method. Basically this is the line I'm trying to use (remove all checkboxes first for testing purpose): $.find("input.jstree-checkbox").removeClass("jstree-checkbox").end()       -   but console claims the object has no method called removeClass.
[11:11:56] <Bower^> Eviltwin, would it be OK to just wrap my script in some function(){script}?
[11:12:24] <austen> The event is part of a 'tools' object which calls a function to set this as the default behavior when the tools object is loaded...
[11:13:34] <Eviltwin> Bower^: Yes (function() { ... })();
[11:13:50] <Bower^> Ah, ok
[11:13:52] <Bower^> thanks again :)
[11:13:59] <t4nkd> Hey all, if I have an array containing element names(e.g. ['a','p']) how can I use those values as selectors with .each? http://pastie.org/2376412
[11:14:09] <Eviltwin> Bower^: http://jsfiddle.net/ruL2X/
[11:14:12] <t4nkd> $(this) doesn't quite work...
[11:14:47] <Bower^> That's great, cheers
[11:14:54] <Bower^> Nice little drag thing too :)
[11:15:36] <erichynds> t4nkd: $(scaleElement).each()
[11:15:47] <t4nkd> oh
[11:15:51] <t4nkd> ...duh
[11:15:52] <erichynds> or
[11:16:09] <erichynds> $.each(scaleElem, function(i,elem){ elem = $(elem); })
[11:23:01] <t4nkd> hrmm, didn't work out
[11:23:03] <t4nkd> Still getting null
[11:25:04] <Bower^> Eviltwin, is there actually any difference between the following fiddles besides syntax? http://jsfiddle.net/etDqy/ and http://jsfiddle.net/etDqy/1/
[11:25:16] <Bower^> To be precise I've just changed how the functions are declared
[11:25:45] <Eviltwin> Bower^: Effectively no
[11:26:05] <Eviltwin> However in the first one, you should be able to move the $(document).ready to the top of that function
[11:26:08] <Eviltwin> And it should still work
[11:26:13] <Bower^> It does
[11:26:13] <Eviltwin> If I recall correctly
[11:26:24] <Bower^> Which style do you think is best?
[11:26:36] <Eviltwin> First one
[11:26:39] <Bower^> Or most common
[11:26:43] <Eviltwin> First one
[11:27:00] <Bower^> Once again eviltwin, thank you :)

[11:45:03] <jexmex> http://pastebin.com/7BaRVkXv - How can I change the name to point to an array name? My checkboxes are named frontpage_agent[$ID], and this code is not working, I can only assume its because the name is an array and using frontpage_agent[] did not seem to work
[11:45:18] <alexparker> hola
[11:46:09] <erichynds> ?escaping @ jexmex
[11:46:10] <bot-t1> jexmex, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[11:47:40] <Gateway69> hi, jquery nube here, how do i when clicking a button, hide my div but their are many divs with the same class name.. so im listing a few profile pics with accept or declient button, when hitting accept it want it to specfically hide that div?
[11:47:50] <jexmex> hmm, so frontpage_agent\\[\\] should work? Just tried it with no luck
[11:48:21] <kborchers> Gateway69: so are those buttons inside the div you want to hide?
[11:49:12] <Gateway69> yea.. i have a div that contains the profile pic, name, and the buttons, lets call it <div class="friends">
[11:49:34] <Gateway69> and when u hit accept i want that div friends to be hidden. with hide
[11:50:14] <erichynds> jexmex: http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/QddYX/
[11:50:50] <kborchers> $(".friends acceptButton").click(function() { $(this).closest(".friends").hide(); }); where acceptButton is a class or some way to select that specific button inside that div
[11:51:05] <Gateway69> i can easly get one friends div to hide, but when i generate the list of friends, each div is the same name "friends"
[11:51:07] <Bower^> damn, beaten :)
[11:51:08] <jexmex> thanks, I will work with it, and see what is happening
[11:52:29] <kborchers> Gateway69: and of course that will need to be inside $(document).ready so that the elements exist when you try to bind to the click event
[11:53:30] <Gateway69> hmm ok let me try that.. so .closest is prob the key im missing
[11:53:42] <kborchers> probably
[11:53:50] <kborchers> ?closest @ Gateway69
[11:53:50] <bot-t1> Gateway69, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[11:53:59] <Gateway69> thanks!
[11:55:25] <lelu> hey
[11:56:03] <Gateway69> so my invite button is in another div called buttons, and it has a class of invitebutton.. so $(".friends #buttons.invitebutton') ?
[11:56:40] <kborchers> Gateway69: nope, $(".friends .inviteButton")
[11:57:06] <Gateway69> oh nice.. ace.. thank u..
[11:57:08] <lelu> I am using $(this).parent().next('.message').fadeToggle('slow'); within an on hover function at www.likepie.net to show and hide twitter messages (the small square icons) how would i get the boxes that are toggled to stay visible when the mouse moves from the hover target to the box itself?
[11:57:51] <kborchers> Gateway69: one question, do all of your button divs have id="buttons" or is that a class?
[11:58:54] <kborchers> basically, what do you mean by a "div called buttons"
[12:04:39] <thefalling> ajpiano: hey i tried using the delgate method, but ran into a brick wall. $("[id^=shipCell]").delegate("div.content", "easyTooltip", ('displayShip' + ($(this).attr('id').substring(8))), function() { }); but i got the error $(this).attr("id") is undefined again :S
[12:04:50] <ajpiano> wtf
[12:04:56] <ajpiano> that's not a function
[12:05:07] <ajpiano> delegate doesn't work like that
[12:05:29] <ajpiano> it doesn't just magically react when new elements show up and do something to them
[12:05:51] <thefalling> damn lol
[12:05:56] <ajpiano> it might be easier for you to just call your tooltip thing after you do your ajax
[12:06:19] <kborchers> ajpiano: sounds like a job for $.unicorn ;)
[12:06:21] <ajpiano> cause the other option is to like, delegate mouseenter and then lazily initialise those tooltips when you get a mouseenter
[12:06:24] <ajpiano> lol
[12:06:36] <thefalling> i just read on the documentation that delgate is the same as using live + each so i just threw it all together
[12:06:51] <ajpiano> thefalling, live doesn't work that way either
[12:07:05] <ajpiano> they're both event delegation, not a callback for when new elements arrive.
[12:07:10] <thefalling> lol then yes, my understanding of live is way off
[12:07:18] <gf3> take your top off!
[12:07:54] * lelu takes the top off
[12:08:00] <thefalling> I thought u could only call stuff in jquery when th epage first loads
[12:08:20] <thefalling> how would i call it after the ajax?
[12:08:29] <ajpiano> in the callback?
[12:08:35] <ajpiano> what gave you that idea
[12:08:49] <thefalling> I dont know, i thought i read it somewher elol
[12:09:31] <madprops> i perform a settimeout on window in a function and i want to cancel it when i enter that function again, is it possible without global variables?
[12:09:44] <gf3> thanks lelu
[12:09:59] <thefalling> So how exactly does live work? I thought it did magically react when new elements showed up lol
[12:10:23] <ajpiano> they're both event delegation
[12:10:31] <ajpiano> thefalling: events bubble up the dom in javasript
[12:10:54] <lelu> hmm... my hidden elements are blocking my links below them even though they aren't visible...anyway of fixing this?
[12:11:10] <lelu> *quickly
[12:11:26] <tmayr> lelu: depends on how you hide em, with display:none they shouldnt be part of the flow at all if im not mistaken, with visibility:hidden they will
[12:11:35] <tmayr> im sure someone will correct me tho :P
[12:12:17] <ajpiano> thefalling: live and delegate are basically wrappers for http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-event-delegation-is-easier-than-you-think/
[12:12:34] <ajpiano> except jquery also is able to synthetically bubble the change, focus, and blur events as well so you can do event delegation with them as well
[12:12:47] <kborchers> tmayr: you're an idiot and that is totally wrong ... just kidding ;) that is correct
[12:12:48] <ajpiano> that article is from before jquery had sugar for doing it though
[12:12:57] <lelu> tman: im using display none
[12:13:01] <thefalling> kk

[12:25:09] <ciss> what is the equivalent to first() in jquery 1.2.6 ?
[12:25:32] <Trisox> ?:first
[12:25:32] <bot-t1> :first: Selects the first matched element. http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[12:25:46] <lelu> ok, if you guys goto http://likepie.net/ and hover over any of the icons below twitter, you will see each "tweet" appear. How would I go about keeping those there if they gain focus from mouse on hover. this is the jquery used: http://pastebin.com/hGk4v4M6
[12:25:48] <Trisox> ?eq
[12:25:48] <bot-t1> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[12:26:01] <kborchers> ciss: why are you using 1.2.6????????
[12:26:34] <ciss> kborchers: drupal 6. and no, i can't upgrade. and yes, i *know* there's a module.
[12:26:59] <kborchers> ciss: i wouldn't have suggested either of those ... i would have said don't use drupal ;)
[12:27:55] <kborchers> ciss: Trisox is right though, you should be able to do .eq(0)
[12:28:15] <kborchers> or just use :first in your selector
[12:28:18] <Trisox> yup
[12:28:20] <ciss> Trisox: thanks. i wouldn't have expected :first to be available in 1.2.6, since first() came with 1.4
[12:28:33] <Trisox> wy not upgrade?
[12:28:41] <ciss> compatibility
[12:28:46] <Trisox> mmm
[12:29:07] <Trisox> that is just a reason wy to upgade :P
[12:29:26] <Trisox> if not to much jquery it is no that hard to do

[12:30:55] <Kronuz> hello
[12:31:12] <raiun> im trying to take an image and when its clicked, put it in another div
[12:31:16] <raiun> but my code isnt working
[12:31:16] <raiun> http://pastie.org/2376746
[12:31:19] <raiun> can somebody take a look?
[12:31:21] <Kronuz> hey, about jQuery UI… the sortable demo that's mixed with draggable at http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/labs/selectable/demos/selectable/draggable.html
[12:31:43] <Kronuz> ….is there a way to mimic that with the latest versions?
[12:32:06] <Trisox> que?
[12:32:35] <Trisox> wy  not?
[12:32:55] <Trisox> http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#photo-manager
[12:33:05] <Trisox> same idea
[12:33:31] <ciss> Trisox: in its current state it looks like one of those annoying logic puzzles :P
[12:33:35] <Kronuz> I'm trying to accomplish exactly that selectable/draggable mix
[12:33:50] <Trisox> indeed hehe
[12:33:59] <Trisox> so mix it up ;)
[12:34:07] <Austin`> How would I select the nth element after using $? Ex: $('a')[0]
[12:34:09] <Trisox> first read the documentation
[12:34:30] <Trisox>  $('a')[0] =  first
[12:34:32] <gho5t> what's the difference between: var foo = function() { } and function foo() { } ?
[12:34:40] <Trisox> [0] =  first in array
[12:36:33] <Trisox> gho5t: take a look @ jQuery.fn and jQuery.extend
[12:36:48] <Austin`> Trisox: yes, but when I do $('a')[0] I don't get an object
[12:37:04] <raiun> http://pastie.org/2376746 whats wrong with this for moving an image to another div
[12:37:05] <Trisox> wy do that?
[12:37:18] <Trisox> same ass  $('a:first')
[12:37:39] <Trisox>  $('a').eq(0)
[12:37:53] <Trisox>  $('a:eq(0)')
[12:38:08] <Trisox> gho5t: check http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[12:38:29] <Austin`> Trisox: thanks, that's what i was looking for
[12:38:45] <kborchers> Austin`: $("a") is your object and [0] gives you the first elem. If you want another elem, either do $("a").eq(1) or $("a")[1] or $("a:nth-child(2)") all of which give you the second element in the array
[12:38:58] <Austin`> kborchers: alright, thanks
[12:39:27] <lata_> Hello. Is there a way to make Webkit browsers respect return false; when clicking a link? (And prevent it from moving the window)...

[12:52:15] <Trisox> its mostly css and ie
[12:52:30] <Trisox> jquery is crossbrowser

[12:54:23] <bamccaig> It sounds like extend() will overwrite properties of the target with the others.
[12:54:41] <jzaksh> does anyone know exactly what event.preventDefault() does that return false does not do? I saw a comment in jquery source that says something about IE, but I can't make out what's going on
[12:54:42] <bamccaig> Is there a method that will /not/ overwrite properties (i.e., apply defaults to an object)?

[12:57:04] <tmayr> jzaksh: return false involves e.preventDefault() and e.stopPropagation(), in most cases you just need preventDefault
[12:57:50] <Trisox> tmayr: i told him that
[12:58:10] <jzaksh> tmayr: aaaahh
[12:58:25] <tmayr> Trisox: i didnt see :P

[13:00:26] <jzaksh> Trisox: strange, i also don't see what you said anywhere
[13:00:33] <jzaksh> lata_: yup, reading now thanks :)
[13:00:47] <lata_> jzaksh: no prob :)
[13:02:24] <Gateway69> anyone know why when i enter a page with my script on it and their is nothing for it to do, that i see unterminated string literal [Break On This Error] $('#message').html("<h2>You are now friends with

[13:18:31] <aro> it doesnt seem to work
[13:18:37] <aro> i cant see the multiple ajax calls
[13:18:46] <droose> you can use facebook connect to login
[13:19:20] <droose> then once your logged in pick any deal and redeem it then go to deals $
[13:19:24] <aro> yeah i tried
[13:19:29] <aro> it said it couldnt get user from facebook
[13:19:49] <droose> hmm
[13:23:11] <droose> aro is there a way to check if the ajax ran once and not run again unless the button is clicked again?
[13:23:44] <droose> i'm using $('#deals-redeemed').bind('show', function() { to start my function so i trigger the show event on nav item click
[13:24:10] <droose> then it runs my ajax call like 5 times or more depending on how many times I have clicked one of the nav items
[13:24:14] <droose> really strange
[13:24:32] <Trisox> use a timer
[13:24:39] <Trisox> delay the ajax call
[13:24:43] <Trisox> ?timeout
[13:24:44] <bot-t1> Trisox, timeout | jQuery Plugins - Timer-X is a simple, light-weight Plugin that allows the developer to easily add Time-delayed controls to their web-page with 2 simple functions. http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/timeout
[13:24:50] <Trisox> not that
[13:24:54] <Xeon06_> Is there a way to do some kind of chaining condition? Say I want to only hide an element if a variable is true? Something like $("#foo").if(bar).hide()?
[13:25:50] <knapper_tech> can i send a request back on a port other than the page was loaded on?
[13:31:24] <droose> does ajax stack the number of calls you have used on a page and each time you do a new one run each one of them before it gets to the latest?
[13:31:51] <droose> almost like some form of a queue
[13:33:29] <ngharo> ajax is asynchronous - multiple calls will be happening at the same time
[13:34:11] <droose> do you have any idea why when i make an ajax call it loops through the same call multiple times?
[13:34:36] <Superstar> Are there any applications that can show you what's happening in a page?
[13:34:49] <ngharo> ?p @ droose
[13:34:49] <bot-t1> droose, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:35:04] <droose> you can log into my app at m.foanar.com
[13:35:10] <ngharo> Superstar: use your browser's tools.  firebug for FF or inspector for chrome
[13:35:22] <Superstar> They only show data returned
[13:35:39] <droose> if facebook connect doesnt work for you I can setup a quick bogus user for you to login
[13:36:13] <ngharo> ya i dont wanna fb connect
[13:36:20] <droose> k one se
[13:36:24] <ngharo> Superstar: what is it that you're looking to see?
[13:37:10] <Nacho__> Is there a way to run something after the page loads and is rendered? I thought of $(window).load but don't think that's right
[13:38:00] <droose> @ngharo you can use u: admin@foanar.com p: admin
[13:38:17] <Bower^> Nacho__,  $(document).ready(function(){});
[13:38:30] <ngharo> droose: then what?
[13:38:35] <Nacho__> But that's after it loads, not after it renders
[13:38:47] <Bower^> Ah, sorry
[13:39:08] <droose> one sec i will setup some redeems to show you whats happening
[13:39:27] <ngharo> Nacho__: ready is when the DOM is loaded.  load should fire when dom is loaded and resources have downloaded
[13:39:39] <Gateway69> anyone here used jquery for notifcation badges on tabs like on facebook or on iOS
[13:39:59] <droose> ok click on deals at the top then $ at the bottom
[13:40:05] <symaxian> Might anyone explain exactly what the arguments are that the easing functions take?
[13:40:46] <ngharo> droose: i hit deals and get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'coords' of undefined
[13:40:53] <ngharo> and hangs at spinna
[13:41:03] <droose> did you allow your location?
[13:41:18] <ngharo> no what are you crazy :p
[13:41:23] <droose> :-)
[13:41:36] <droose> the app needs that to calculate distance to deals
[13:42:07] <ngharo> Ok 1 sec
[13:43:09] <Superstar> ngharo: I've created a 'like' button similar to facebook but it only works once per link. I don't know why it's doing this or where I've made a mistake if I can't see what data's been replaced. My html http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/666773/ and the php http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/
[13:47:20] <Nacho__> ngharo: Humm.
[13:47:23] <Nacho__> Ty
[13:50:40] <ngharo> droose: ok so whats the prob now?  im looking at $ page
[13:51:02] <droose> click one of eht "?" to update the amount saved
[13:51:18] <droose> then try closing it
[13:51:32] <droose> lol it runs the code like 5 times…
[13:51:38] <ccmonster> hola peoples
[13:54:06] <Nacho__> ngharo: I am trying to show some loading gif while data is loaded via Ajax (using SPServices plugin). But, the loading image never shows, instead the page just stops rendering until the Ajax is done
[13:54:56] <Superstar> Sorry, PHP http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/666781/
[13:55:53] <ngharo> droose: i see click handlers bound to update savings 3 times
[13:56:33] <droose> ngharo: do you mean the .toggle('slow")?
[13:57:26] <ngharo> $('#updated-saved').data('events').click in console
[13:57:28] <cerzi> hi all, how come when I update an element value using a jquery function, if I later try to access that element it is still set to what it was on the original page load?
[13:57:30] <droose> ngharo: that should be correct… and they shouldn't actually run unless the element was clicked… thats how i noticed my ajax call running 5 times
[13:57:46] <cerzi> surely there is some way to access the updated value?
[13:57:54] <kborchers> ?demo @ cerzi
[13:57:55] <bot-t1> cerzi, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:58:15] <cerzi> give me a mo
[14:04:06] <DofLeFou> Anyone know of a good Accordion style Menu
[14:05:22] <cerzi> hmm okay so ive rebuilt the problem here http://jsfiddle.net/eX78r/1/ but it actually works properly there, so it must be a bug elsewhere in my code
[14:05:46] <cerzi> seems odd though as i dont know what else would cause it to not be able to get the updated value with my code
[14:06:05] <cerzi> full details of my problem here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7068876/jquery-accessing-an-attribute-value-that-has-been-updated-since-the-page-was-loa
[14:06:56] <Nacho__> ngharo: Any idea what I could be doing wrong?
[14:09:00] <kborchers> cerzi: this doesn't make any sense form.find("answer_key").attr("value", data.answer_key)
[14:09:27] <kborchers> change that to form.find(".answer_key").val(data.answer_key);
[14:09:34] <ngharo> Nacho__: need to see some code
[14:09:59] <cerzi> kborchers: yep that was spotted by someone else - i changed it to exactly as you recommend but no change
[14:10:22] <cerzi> what is really confusing me is that everything works fine if the page is refreshed and no jquery calls are made prior to that
[14:10:47] <cerzi> but that particular function totally ignores any changes made to the page for some reason
[14:10:57] <cerzi> has stumped me for the last 4 hours ><
[14:11:11] <kborchers> cerzi: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/eX78r/2/
[14:11:30] <Ogredude> alright, I'm trying to build acceptance specs with RSpec + capybara-webkit for this JQuery UI autocomplete widget.  There is some behavior tied to the change event on the autocomplete field. What's going to be the best way to trigger that change event?  I can execute javascript on the document from within the spec.
[14:11:45] <ngharo> droose: im thinking it has something to do with line 120 global.js.  eval is rebinding events again and again
[14:11:56] <cerzi> kborchers: yeah, thats essentially the same as in my code except that if you click SET and then GET, you'll get an empty alert box still
[14:12:02] <Ogredude> I've tried sending it $("#element").val("Stuff").blur() and that doesn't seem to do it
[14:12:30] <cerzi> *unless* you refresh the page (causing the page to be rendered with the updated value), in which case clicking GET retrieves the value correctly
[14:12:52] <cerzi> so, somehow jquery isn't noticing the dom change, *despite the fact that it shows in the source code when inspected*
[14:13:44] <ngharo> droose: you should use live/delegate to bind events once not unbind and rebind each time
[14:14:41] <kborchers> cerzi: if i load this page http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/eX78r/3/, click get the alert is blank, click set, click get the alert says UPDATED
[14:15:13] <cerzi> kborchers: yeah, sorry - i mean, in my actual code - what I wrote there is abstracted because the code itself is a bit too complex to put up there
[14:15:21] <cerzi> its filled with jinja2 etc
[14:15:44] <cerzi> but i can't tell the functional difference between that and mine
[14:16:04] <kborchers> ok, so let's see the code. gotta leave in 15 min so ...
[14:16:45] <cerzi> kborchers: ok, i've dumped the whole thing up here: http://pastebin.com/NNjKXGqG
[14:17:39] <cerzi> it makes a load of xhr to a python server but that isnt relevent to it not working as the alert() function gives the empty dialog box before its submitted to server anyway
[14:18:54] <kborchers> cerzi: where do you define form? i only see it refereneced in saveInfo and in processAnswer which are two functions with two different scopes so neither of them know about each other's form var
[14:19:37] <cerzi> kborchers: its a jquery form plugin thing
[14:19:47] <cerzi> i think
[14:20:07] <cerzi> that is to say, all those form.finds work fine in all other respects
[14:20:11] <cerzi> so that can't be the problem
[14:20:43] <cerzi> oh, i guess because in saveInfo it's assigned without "var"
[14:20:48] <cerzi> which afaik makes it a global
[14:21:26] <Bower^> does jquery have some kind of functionality that allows you to create a nice horizontal scrolling div?
[14:21:55] <kborchers> ?animate @ Bower^
[14:21:55] <bot-t1> Bower^, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[14:22:39] <Bower^> Sweet. So that would allow me to contain a relatively large amount of data within a small area? I need some kind of context navigation panel for something I'm making
[14:22:54] <cerzi> kborchers: basically the issue seems to be between line99: form.find(".answer_key").val(data.answer_key) and line114: var key = $(this).closest("form").children(".answer_key").val();.. and the weirdness comes from the fact that line99 is effective in changing the value, in the source
[14:24:01] <cerzi> basically var key = $(this).closest("form").children(".answer_key").val(); is still, for some reason, reading from the original pageload dom
[14:24:35] <kborchers> cerzi: when is processAnswer called?
[14:25:04] <cerzi> kborchers: on success of the form being submitted by xhr
[14:25:18] <cerzi> it's the success call of $('form').ajaxForm({
[14:31:46] <kborchers> cerzi: not sure, sorry gotta go
[14:31:58] <cerzi> kborchers: ok, thanks all the same
[14:33:07] <ale> how can I get an url parameter with jquery?
[14:34:23] <ccmonster> look at jquery param functions
[14:34:31] <ccmonster> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[14:34:48] <ccmonster> ? .param() @ ale
[14:34:48] <bot-t1> ale, jQuery.param(obj): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[14:35:29] <Bower^> i think he means getting query string values
[14:35:40] <ale> YES
[14:36:11] <Bower^> ale I'm pretty new to JS and jQuery. I don't know of a jQuery library function but I do have some code that does it
[14:36:25] <ale> Can you show it to me?
[14:36:34] <Bower^> just pass it the query string key and it returns the value
[14:36:53] <Bower^> http://goo.gl/IITye
[14:37:09] <ccmonster> or just use ?bbq @ale
[14:37:10] <bot-t1> BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[14:37:13] <Bower^> I would imagine jQuery does have something for this
[14:37:21] <ccmonster> $.deparam.querystring()
[14:37:24] <ale> thanks guys
[14:37:46] <ccmonster> anything by benalman is pretty good.
[14:39:45] <DofLeFou> I m looking for a Jquery Vertical Tab plugins
[14:39:49] <DofLeFou> Any hints
[14:40:21] <JJMalina> is there an easy way to detect when the browser window is resized by the user?
[14:40:47] <JJMalina> ah nvm i think resize() is what I'm looking for
[14:43:32] <Bower^> I'm after some VERY simple horizontal scrolling functionality. I just wanna specify width, height, background-color and so and just have it automatically add some arrows on each side to navigate. Am I better of trying to code it myself or just use a plugin?
[14:44:31] <Kronuz> in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/P2keM/1/ …why can't I select single items with click?
[14:52:10] <cerzi> does anyone know if callback functions from jqform ajax stuff have any oddities wrt modifying the dom? having strang unsolvable problems here
[15:00:12] <sphinxxx> anyone here a regex ninja?
[15:15:44] <ngharo> i like regex
[15:16:40] <jkline> sphinxxx: i'm a regex pirate...
[15:17:51] <sphinxxx> how can i select the value between two commas
[15:18:04] <sphinxxx> eg,  in  "4,something.jpg,Some image"
[15:18:09] <sphinxxx> i want to select "something.jpg"
[15:21:01] <ngharo> /,([^,]+),/
[15:21:07] <ngharo> try that
[15:22:17] <ngharo> or really you should just split
[15:22:30] <ngharo> "4,something.jpg,Some image".split(',')[1]
[15:22:34] <ngharo> ?js "4,something.jpg,Some image".split(',')[1]
[15:22:36] <bot-t1> ngharo: "something.jpg"
[15:25:44] <sphinxxx> ngharo, that regex, seems to grab it, but with the commas
[15:26:06] <sphinxxx> i'm in PHP atm, i don't think .split works?
[15:26:30] <ngharo> explode == split
[15:26:36] <aaronw-1> yeah explode
[15:26:42] <aaronw-1> use that to pull apart stuff using a delimiter
[15:34:47] <Ogredude> is there a good way to test the functionality of a JQuery UI autocomplete widget using Jasmine?
[15:35:06] <Ogredude> I'm not having any luck at all with capybara-webkit

[15:45:09] <K1ng> how to replace string?
[15:49:45] <K1ng> like string = "blah blah blah WONO"; string.replaceText('WONO', 'blah');
[15:52:31] <raiun> how can i pass an element into a function so the function can manipulate that specific element?
[15:53:03] <aximilation> just drop the selector in?
[15:53:25] <aximilation> function($('#id'), "other params");
[15:53:29] <raiun> oh ok
[15:53:30] <raiun> thx
[15:53:43] <aximilation> (if you'reg teting an element by its id
[15:53:52] <aximilation> no prob
[16:01:07] <Hfuy> Looking at the source it seems that jQuery.fn.offset would work only if the borders and margins involved in calculating the offset are specified in pixels. Is this true?
[16:02:53] <crankharder> looking for a plugin that can fade one element into another.  think image cross fading, except applied to a generic html element, like a div.
[16:04:19] <Hfuy> crankharder: I wrote one but it's nothing to do with jquery
[16:19:11] <yarco> how to make a jquery plugin auto run after loading the document?
[16:19:55] <tmayr> put it inside $(document).ready(function{})
[16:20:12] <tmayr> anyone has any idea how to prevent jQueryui Datepicker onSelect even to fire on initialization?
[16:20:43] <yarco> tmayr: is that ok? i mean in a jquery plugin?
[16:21:16] <tmayr> well you should be calling the plugin after the doc is ready, thats for sure

[16:47:27] <abjorn> paul_irish does
[16:47:32] <imsky> has anyone ever been more like
[16:47:50] <guy> abjorn: ew... linode? seriously? I've spent 2 years with them. It took me exactly that long to realize that simply owning your own dedi is 100x better.
[16:47:57] <mekwall> let me rephrase... who have the longest dick except mr irish?
[16:48:00] <abjorn> and also more expensive
[16:48:04] <imsky> mekwall: you have the shortest
[16:48:09] <abjorn> lol'd
[16:48:16] <mekwall> tell me something I dont already know please...
[16:48:24] <abjorn> I don't have the $$$$$ for a dedi
[16:48:27] <imsky> $$$
[16:48:35] <imsky> $("money").wiggle();
[16:48:37] <mekwall> we all know it's all about how you use it...
[16:48:45] <abjorn> no its not
[16:48:48] <mekwall> at least that's what the lady said
[16:48:50] <gnarf> guy: I use like 4 linodes
[16:48:52] <imsky> abjorn: oh dude, my little github project cssFx has been going pretty well
[16:48:55] <raiun> is there a way if can select the element that I put a script in?
[16:48:57] <gnarf> and have been quite happy with their service
[16:48:58] <mekwall> so you don't know the ladies eh? :)
[16:48:59] <abjorn> fuck yeah imsky
[16:49:11] <imsky> abjorn: now it supports external stylesheets omg
[16:49:13] <raiun> like if i put script in <p><script>..</script></p> can i call the <p>?
[16:49:14] <abjorn> my boss couchdb abstraction lib is goin pretty well too
[16:49:14] <guy> gnarf: all I am saying: it is not price-efficient
[16:49:15] <imsky> tell all your friends
[16:49:20] <imsky> abjorn: are yo done with it?
[16:49:22] <abjorn> in by that I mean I finished it already and it has no bugs
[16:49:27] <imsky> hahah
[16:49:35] <mekwall> imsky: my friends are all ladies and already know :P
[16:49:39] <guy> anyway
[16:49:42] <guy> anyone know of any jQuery plugin that'd allow to draw? something as close to MS Paint as possible.
[16:49:45] <imsky> make a nice site and promote that shit abjorn
[16:49:52] <abjorn> That goes way beyond a plugin, I think, guy
[16:49:54] <imsky> guy: , there are webgl tools
[16:49:57] <mekwall> anyway, what the fuck are you all on about?
[16:49:58] <imsky> mspaint was 6 years ago
[16:50:11] <gnarf> guy: okay the fact that you just asked that question makes me ignore your earlier comment on "price efficient"
[16:50:28] <raiun> is there a way if can select the element that I put a script in?
[16:50:32] <mekwall> mspaint is kinda epic... just look at minecraft
[16:50:34] <imsky> raiun: yes, duh
[16:50:38] <imsky> mekwall: wat
[16:50:42] <raiun> imsky: how?
[16:50:49] <raiun> kinda new to js/jquery
[16:50:51] <imsky> raiun, use a jquery selector
[16:50:51] <aximilation> guy: Yea, obviously havin ga dedi is a nice way to go, however VPSs are a great way to get started out with
[16:50:54] <gnarf> mekwall: are you drunk? :)
[16:50:56] <guy> gnarf: haha lol. how is that related? I own media company, and it is no way on earth more efficient for us to use something like linode, rather than having our own servers.
[16:51:06] <mekwall> gnarf: that was a dumb question :D
[16:51:14] <imsky> one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
[16:51:15] <abjorn> More and more people are turning to VPS' these days.
[16:51:19] <abjorn> Easier to manage, cheaper, etc
[16:51:24] <imsky> i'm considering vps for my big ass project
[16:51:26] <raiun> imsky: whats the jquery selector for the element the script tag is inside of? cus im iterating a bunch of elements, and i want the same script for each one
[16:51:41] <imsky> raiun, $("script").parent()
[16:51:45] <raiun> ty
[16:51:45] <guy> aximilation: uh.. but why? the price diff is relatively low. I am paying like EUR 90/month and this is pretty good dedi. I bet there are dedis like for EUR 40-50.
[16:51:50] <abjorn> imsky: I love the fact that with most VPS's with the push of a button to can switch linux distro
[16:51:52] <mekwall> if I randomly jump into a discussion acting like a troll, the response to that question is: HELL YE!
[16:51:54] <aximilation> it all depends on the scale of project that you are doing, most small stuff will do just fine on a VPS at $20/mo or so
[16:52:07] <imsky> abjorn: yeah, i'm doing some rackspace work for clients, it's a pretty sweet setup
[16:52:13] <aximilation> If I have the needs for resources that would cost me more than $80-100 then sure, I'd go with a dedi
[16:52:22] <mekwall> gnarf: are you happy? :)
[16:52:29] <gnarf> mekwall: i figured you were ;)
[16:52:35] <abjorn> imsky: linode is pretty beast
[16:52:45] <imsky> yeah another client of mine used it
[16:52:47] <mekwall> gnarf: haha :D you know me good enough
[16:52:50] <imsky> it's just cloud shit, right?
[16:52:54] <guy> aximilation: well, I use my dedi for all the projects. This makes sense VS having VPS for every project.
[16:53:21] <aximilation> maybe virtualize myself, as I've done in the past... but that said, for small scale linode is great, but anything more than 3-4 linode boxes, yea I'd go with a dedi
[16:53:30] <abjorn> imsky: not cloud, idk of any cloud based vps
[16:53:33] <abjorn> it works like any other vps
[16:53:46] <mekwall> gnarf: as long as this discussion is about cloud and mspaint I'm feeling very much at home; drunk or not
[16:53:48] <abjorn> I actually have two vps' one with linode and one with volumedrive. Volumedrive is cheaper ($5/mo for 2 ghz cpu, 1 gb ram, 50 gb hdd) but support and features are shit
[16:54:00] <aximilation> volumedrive sucks, lol
[16:54:07] <mekwall> you suck
[16:54:08] <abjorn> yeah they really do
[16:54:11] <imsky> hmmm is vps worth it? i mean shared hosting hides all that other garbage
[16:54:13] <guy> anyway. using jQuery for creating HTML5 driven paint is probably stupid; what comes next, flash?
[16:54:15] <abjorn> I only use it to host a irc bot
[16:54:15] <abjorn> :D
[16:54:17] <imsky> with vps you pay for it
[16:54:19] <aximilation> I had some serious issues with them, however I have the $15 VPS at $5 now, so yea..
[16:54:25] <abjorn> anyways im off, gonna go get ice cream with a friend
[16:54:27] <mekwall> guy: already invented by adobe.
[16:54:32] <imsky> abjorn: alright man, take her easy
[16:54:35] <guy> mekwall: I need it web based.
[16:54:39] <imsky> wiggle for presidents
[16:54:48] <abjorn> imsky: it is actually a girl but it aint like that lololol
[16:54:51] * abjorn wiggles
[16:54:51] <guy> I need users to sketch some stuff and save it.
[16:54:52] <abjorn> bbl
[16:54:53] <imsky> oh daaamn
[16:54:55] <imsky> laate
[16:54:59] <mekwall> guy: how about... dreamweaver dev ?
[16:55:08] <guy> mekwall: wtf are you talking about?
[16:55:14] <imsky> wtf is anyone talking about
[16:55:22] <mekwall> guy: ok... adobe edge?
[16:55:26] <imsky> wat
[16:55:33] <imsky> why would you use something about to be payware
[16:55:33] * gnarf lols
[16:55:36] <mekwall> imsky: no idea. trying to find out
[16:55:37] <aximilation> imsky: it depends on what you're doing, with a VPS you can get better performanc, access, etc, it's also intro 101 into larger scale systems admin if you're into that.
[16:55:48] <guy> dude. I am not talking about developing process. I need to create sort of sketch gallery.
[16:56:00] <mekwall> gnarf: I'm happy to be of service :D
[16:56:05] <imsky> aximilation: yeah i know, it's your own server. but it's not really cost-effective at the low-end is it? or are there cut-rate vps's?
[16:56:19] <guy> uh. anyway, Google is my better friend then you guys. (sighs. & snobs out)
[16:56:25] <mekwall> guy: so you need a web based animation tool?
[16:56:49] <mekwall> guy: are you talking to yourself?
[16:56:53] <gnarf> guy: 10 seconds on google: http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/html5-canvas-painting/
[16:57:04] <aximilation> it all depends on what you're doing imsky. If you're doing web dev/hosting you could easily have 2 clients pay for a good VPS...
[16:57:08] <mekwall> gnarf: slowmo!
[16:57:10] <guy> gnarf: I've seen that.
[16:57:21] <imsky> aximilation: i'm looking into it for a large-scale web service, wondering if it makes sense
[16:57:57] <guy> gnarf: the problem is that it doesn't allow you actually to draw, like a brush tool would. you only can draw figures.
[16:58:12] <aximilation> glad to chat about it, but this has gotten way offtopic, msg me if you want some thoughts
[16:58:19] <imsky> haha thanks but it's ok
[16:58:23] <imsky> don't want to bother you
[16:58:49] <mekwall> imsky: cloud based services is your friend
[16:59:07] <mekwall> imsky: what language do you use back-end?
[16:59:09] <gnarf> guy: um, i'm drawing with it
[16:59:12] <aximilation> you might want to look into mediatemple, they're decent, better than shared, less work than a VPS
[16:59:15] <imsky> mekwall: the basest of them all, php
[16:59:34] <mekwall> imsky: so you're in the same shitty situation as me :D
[16:59:45] <aximilation> fun stuff!
[16:59:49] <imsky> lol
[16:59:56] <mekwall> imsky: I will suggest the same host I use myself... Glesys
[16:59:57] * aximilation is coding php today as well
[17:00:22] <mekwall> imsky: they are the "Swedish House Mafia" of hosting
[17:00:25] <imsky> daaaamn
[17:00:38] <mekwall> imsky: http://glesys.com/
[17:01:18] <imsky> mekwall: thanks brah
[17:01:33] <mekwall> imsky: and yes, I am running these enterprise-rated already
[17:01:53] <mekwall> imsky: they are small, but they have a helluva service you won't find with any of the big fish
[17:01:54] <imsky> cool, bookmarked for future research mekwall :D
[17:02:23] <austen> Is it just me, or does Internet Explorer really have a hard time with draggables? I built a simple slider and IE crawls to a hault when I drag the handle...
[17:03:02] <mekwall> imsky: they offer both xen and openvz instances, so its pretty much go go from there :D
[17:03:09] <imsky> oh no
[17:03:14] <imsky> does that need book learning?
[17:03:29] <mekwall> austen: IE has a problem with mostly anything
[17:04:39] <mekwall> imsky: openvz and xen? no... they are the two most reknown virtual machine monitors out there (that is open-source and free)
[17:05:14] <imsky> oh ok
[17:05:27] <imsky> sweet :D
[17:05:55] <mekwall> imsky: openvz is outperforms xen, but handles memory in a very special way
[17:06:19] <imsky> oh for sure
[17:06:24] <imsky> segfaulting here and there
[17:06:33] <mekwall> imsky: openvz is merely a layer ontop of the parent os, so there's nearly no overhead... but you'll have to deal with a non-swapping system.. which can be a pain
[17:06:33] <aximilation> I've been using xen based systems more, but they are both good
[17:06:54] <austen> Any workarounds?
[17:07:10] <imsky> mekwall: why would non-swapping be a problem?
[17:07:12] <mekwall> imsky: it's like running a bus at 60mph right into a wall... if you run out of memory :)
[17:07:41] <mekwall> imsky: it doesn't have to be... all comes down to the services/software you run on it
[17:07:58] <mekwall> imsky: mongodb for example, have a really hard time working with openvz
[17:08:16] <imsky> aww
[17:08:25] <imsky> yeah let's stick to not-crazy stuff
[17:08:32] <imsky> i've actually heard of xen anyway
[17:08:44] <mekwall> imsky: mongodb want to use up as much of your free memory as possible which creates headache... been there done that :D
[17:08:48] <guy> gnarf: this is what I was looking for
[17:08:49] <guy> http://hakim.se/experiments/html5/sketch/
[17:08:57] <mekwall> imsky: xen works more like the conventional vps
[17:09:16] <mekwall> imsky: it will slow down gradually as you run out of memory and the machine starts swapping
[17:09:30] <imsky> hmm
[17:09:38] <mekwall> guy: hakim is the dude!
[17:10:07] <mekwall> guy: have you looked at deviantart muro?
[17:10:24] <mekwall> guy: http://muro.deviantart.com/
[17:11:02] <mekwall> imsky: if you have questions, shoot P
[17:11:29] <imsky> mekwall: i think you answered most of the questions i had
[17:11:35] <imsky> and a lot i didn't have
[17:11:54] <mekwall> imsky: haha :) well... I blame on the alcohol in my blood as gnarf already pointed ou
[17:11:56] <mekwall> +t
[17:12:17] <imsky> blame it on the al-al-alcohol
[17:12:24] <mekwall> sadly I have very little time to dedicate to this channel :(
[17:12:30] <TheIronSky> OY!!
[17:12:32] <imsky> if there's only 1 chan
[17:12:35] <imsky> it should be #jquery
[17:12:40] <imsky> this is freenode rolled into one
[17:12:44] <mekwall> imsky: or #jquery-ot :D
[17:12:48] <imsky> lol wat
[17:12:53] <imsky> no, this IS #jquery-ot
[17:13:00] <imsky> #jquery is in #jquery-ot
[17:13:05] <TheIronSky> or #freenode
[17:13:07] <mekwall> haha
[17:13:32] <mekwall> imsky: I love #jquery for its people and openess :) but it's a time sink
[17:13:59] <imsky> no way bro
[17:14:06] <imsky> there are like hours when nothing happens
[17:14:09] <imsky> and then IT'S ALIVE
[17:14:16] <mekwall> imsky: like NOW?
[17:14:27] <TheIronSky> aliving
[17:14:39] <imsky> SO ALIVE
[17:14:55] <TheIronSky> USING JQUERY AJAX FUNCTIONS
[17:15:05] <TheIronSky> how would I load a specific div?
[17:15:14] <mekwall> load in what way?
[17:15:20] <mekwall> WAT WAY U SAY?
[17:15:29] <TheIronSky> can I just do  .load("/tezt.html#somet_div");
[17:15:45] <TheIronSky> incredible amounts of typos in there
[17:16:01] <imsky> no
[17:16:05] <imsky> you can't do that
[17:16:07] <mekwall> TheIronSky: you want to load some crap into a div?
[17:16:11] <TheIronSky> yes
[17:16:12] <ch3mical> No, but you could do .load(test.html).find(thediv) and do other stuff with it
[17:16:19] <mekwall> TheIronSky: where does the crap come from?
[17:16:22] <TheIronSky> what if the page only had the one div
[17:16:22] <imsky> .children(thediv)
[17:16:31] <imsky> THEN YOU'RE SCREWED I GUESS
[17:16:36] <gnarf> TheIronSky: .load("test.html #theDivYouWant")
[17:16:41] <mekwall> TheIronSky: $("
[17:16:43] <ch3mical> What's with all the yelling today?
[17:16:44] <mekwall> eh...
[17:16:53] <TheIronSky> gnarf, that's all I needed to see
[17:17:03] <gnarf> ?load
[17:17:04] <bot-t1> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[17:17:19] <TheIronSky> I was just there, all I wanted was clarification
[17:17:19] <mekwall> $("#hitler-moon-ufos").load("barabam.html #ufos");
[17:17:25] <gnarf> TheIronSky: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[17:17:31] <mekwall> but gnarf did that quicker then I did :(
[17:17:34] <TheIronSky> I see what you did there, mekwall
[17:17:35] <gnarf> TheIronSky: "Loading Page Fragments"
[17:17:37] <mekwall> I blame the al-al-alcohol
[17:18:05] <TheIronSky> it's just that there are no pictures on that page, so I can't expect myself to read that
[17:18:11] <TheIronSky> *sarcasm
[17:18:52] <imsky> mekwall: do you speek rashan?
[17:19:02] <mekwall> imsky: no, but I speak viking
[17:19:16] <imsky> 10-4 odin
[17:19:28] <mekwall> imsky: odin r en fin isbrytare
[17:19:35] <imsky> oh jeez
[17:19:42] <mekwall> actually, the best icebreaker out there
[17:19:50] <imsky> yeah man, gets the panties dropping
[17:20:14] <mekwall> horny on odin?
[17:20:36] <TheIronSky> viking skills cause immediate reactions with the ladies
[17:20:45] <TheIronSky> specifically the "raping and pillaging" part
[17:20:47] <mekwall> tell me something I dont know
[17:21:07] <mekwall> yeah, it works only so far
[17:21:21] <imsky> lolol
[17:21:29] <imsky> and somewhere up there, someone was asking a jquery question
[17:21:32] <imsky> come on down, brave soldier
[17:21:59] <mekwall> TheIronSky: come on down dude... we all know there's no ufos
[17:22:05] <TheIronSky> COME ON DOWN! You're on the Price Is Right!
[17:22:14] <TheIronSky> and my name has nothing to do with the movie
[17:22:17] <TheIronSky> I had it first
[17:22:18] <mekwall> which means I choose door number 2
[17:22:27] <mekwall> 1 has the goat, right?
[17:22:28] <jaypitidi> how can I find the title tag of a page loaded through ajax and store it in a variable?
[17:22:47] <TheIronSky> Browsers knock out the title tag when using ajax
[17:22:51] <TheIronSky> I do believe
[17:23:09] <mekwall> jaypitidi: that's not possible, as far as a viking knows
[17:23:12] <TheIronSky> because it uses innerHTML
[17:23:28] <TheIronSky> jQuery uses the browser's .innerHTML property to parse the retrieved document and insert it into the current document. During this process, browsers often filter elements from the document such as <html>, <title>, or <head> elements.
[17:23:57] <TheIronSky> VIKINGS KNOW ALL
[17:23:57] <jaypitidi> So is there a javascript method to do it?
[17:24:02] <TheIronSky> I have no ida
[17:24:04] <TheIronSky> *idea
[17:24:07] <mekwall> jaypitidi: the logical answer would be var foo = $("title", loadedPage).text();
[17:24:29] <mekwall> TheIronSky: they knew all. but they dont exist.
[17:24:39] <ajpiano> jaypitidi: TheIronSky http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#htmldoc
[17:24:42] <TheIronSky> I hail from Vikings
[17:25:15] <TheIronSky> ajpiano, that quote is also on the jquery.com's ajax page

[17:25:54] <ajpiano> i know that
[17:26:02] <ajpiano> i'm saying there's a workaround, and that is it.
[17:26:10] <TheIronSky> I don't care
[17:26:10] <mekwall> wow. I just realized I have a snuff stuffed in my lip :/
[17:26:13] <TheIronSky> I didn't ask
[17:26:13] <imsky> hahaha
[17:26:16] <imsky> I DONT CARE
[17:26:21] <ajpiano> ok cool i take the knowledge back
[17:26:26] <Brodingo> YEAH YOU BETTER
[17:26:26] <TheIronSky> TAKE IT BACK
[17:26:27] <ajpiano> no using that in future situations

[17:26:39] <TheIronSky> that's right

[17:29:59] <vol7ron> maybe… but no reason to have to make us use dictionary
[17:30:28] <Brodingo> wisdom
[17:30:29] * mekwall resumes IRC
[17:30:33] <imsky> lol
[17:30:46] <mekwall> that's all you got to say?
[17:34:18] <imsky> i'm a busy beaver, an efficient beaver
[17:34:49] <mekwall> just like http://www.squashtalk.com/photos/college2001/beaver2.jpg
[17:38:18] <TheIronSky> alright, having difficulty with this .load() thing
[17:38:27] <TheIronSky> this shouldn't be this difficult
[17:38:39] <mekwall> fire ze missiles
[17:38:45] <ajpiano> i doubt you can do it using load cause it's not going to parse it using that workaround
[17:38:47] <TheIronSky> already tried
[17:38:53] <ajpiano> so really, good job not caring about it
[17:39:03] <TheIronSky> well, let me put this into perspective
[17:39:23] <mekwall> "when there are nazi ufos coming from the back of the moon..."
[17:39:30] <ajpiano> a regular brunelleschi over here
[17:39:31] <mekwall> that's your perspective :/
[17:39:54] <TheIronSky> I'm trying to load an html document that I can update instead of going around to all of the other pages and updating each of them by hand
[17:40:04] <TheIronSky> for example, recent blog posts
[17:40:23] <mekwall> why are you loading a html doc you can update?
[17:40:31] <ajpiano> huh
[17:40:47] <TheIronSky> let's say I have a blog
[17:41:03] <TheIronSky> and instead of going to each page and adding a link every time I have a new post
[17:41:17] <TheIronSky> I want to put that link on only one page
[17:41:22] <ajpiano> ... you use an actual cms or static site generator that builds a reusable include?
[17:41:25] <TheIronSky> so that all of the other pages will update
[17:41:50] <TheIronSky> yes, but I'm far too lazy to set up a CMS at this point
[17:42:16] <ajpiano> that's like saying i'm too lazy to buy a house, i'm going to carefully engineer a shack made out of garbage
[17:42:50] <aximilation> LOL
[17:42:54] <TheIronSky> or this site needs to be simple and I already have everything organized
[17:42:54] * aximilation agrees
[17:43:30] <ajpiano> omg are you trying to have this include be built by parsing recent blog posts on the client side
[17:44:10] <TheIronSky> wat
[17:44:28] <ajpiano> why do you need to get the <title> from a full html document
[17:44:35] <TheIronSky> I DON'T
[17:44:38] <TheIronSky> that wasn't my question
[17:44:44] <TheIronSky> that was some other jackass
[17:44:56] <ajpiano> lollll so then what isn't working for you :)
[17:45:27] <TheIronSky> this damn load function
[17:45:38] <TheIronSky> I just want to load a div from one page into another page
[17:45:50] <TheIronSky> and the page I'm loading from is set up specifically to support this
[17:46:01] <ajpiano> how is it not working
[17:46:09] <TheIronSky> I have no idea, that's my question
[17:46:26] <ajpiano> do you hvae a live demo
[17:46:28] <ajpiano> of it failing
[17:46:29] <TheIronSky> let's say I have something like this
[17:46:31] <TheIronSky> $("#organizer").load("navigation.html")
[17:46:48] <TheIronSky> I want to load that page into the div #organizer
[17:46:53] <ajpiano> ok
[17:47:03] <TheIronSky> for some odd reason, it doesnt load
[17:47:17] <ajpiano> right.
[17:47:24] <ajpiano> so unless you have a demo of that happening or some more code or whatnot
[17:47:34] <TheIronSky> one moment
[17:47:36] <ajpiano> i probably am not going to be able to just guess why
[17:47:37] <TheIronSky> let me get it live
[17:47:40] <ajpiano> ok
[17:48:12] <TheIronSky> http://ironenclave.com/
[17:48:28] <TheIronSky> that div on the right that's completely empty is #organizer
[17:48:45] <TheIronSky> http://ironenclave.com/navigation.html is the page I'm trying to load
[17:49:23] <ajpiano> TheIronSky it needs to be in a document ready block
[17:49:24] <Brodingo> is that like a play on steel brotherhood and the enclave
[17:49:43] <ajpiano> you can't load content into a div that doesn't exist.
[17:49:50] <TheIronSky> Brodingo: it could be... but it isn't
[17:49:56] <TheIronSky> the div exists
[17:50:01] <ajpiano> not when the code runs
[17:50:07] <TheIronSky> ...explain
[17:50:32] <ajpiano> have you written jquery code that uses $(document).ready(function() {})
[17:50:43] <TheIronSky> yes
[17:50:46] <ajpiano> do that.
[17:50:47] <ajpiano> now.
[17:50:53] <vol7ron> lmao
[17:50:59] <TheIronSky> I will now proceed to shove code into other code
[17:51:56] <DanHakimi> I need a good way to wait for some animations to end before starting any others
[17:52:01] <TheIronSky> I have shoved the aforementioned code and I still have no success.
[17:52:12] <DanHakimi> as far as I can tell, jQuery offers five solutions to that, and none of them work
[17:52:20] <vol7ron> I wonder how good a site for game developers is, when people designing it don't know that much about JS
[17:52:40] <imsky> what are you talking about
[17:52:48] <TheIronSky> considering I work mainly in C++ and not javascript, pretty damn good
[17:52:50] <DanHakimi> http://danhakimi.com/works.php
[17:52:54] <ajpiano> TheIronSky: did you upload it
[17:52:55] <DanHakimi> hit "web"
[17:53:07] <TheIronSky> ajpiano: YES
[17:53:09] <DanHakimi> and then hit "<<" or ">>" a whole bunch
[17:53:10] <vol7ron> is C++ still around?
[17:53:13] <imsky> that font is piercing my eyes, DanHakimi
[17:53:17] <imsky> vol7ron: lol nice one troll
[17:53:19] <ajpiano> TheIronSky: are you sure
[17:53:24] <vol7ron> lol
[17:53:29] <TheIronSky> ajpiano
[17:53:34] <TheIronSky> YES
[17:53:41] <TheIronSky> hory shite
[17:53:48] <TheIronSky> it was a CSS issue
[17:53:50] <TheIronSky> fix'd
[17:53:51] <DanHakimi> huh? what's wrong with the font?
[17:53:53] <imsky> it sucks
[17:54:00] <imsky> also pressing the buttons really fast overlays the content
[17:54:01] <DanHakimi> which one?
[17:54:05] <vol7ron> can someone tell me how to make HTML?
[17:54:07] <imsky> um all of them
[17:54:07] <DanHakimi> yeah, imsky
[17:54:13] <DanHakimi> that's the problem I'm trying to solve
[17:54:17] <imsky> vol7ron: come on man, this chan is very busy, no trolling pl0x
[17:54:36] <TheIronSky> ajpiano: gracias for the help, however the sarcastic comments were not entirely useful
[17:54:45] <imsky> DanHakimi: let me screenshot for ya
[17:54:54] <ajpiano> TheIronSky: i was shift refreshing a bunch of times it didn't show up
[17:55:01] <vol7ron> imsky: ahh ok
[17:55:08] <DanHakimi> k
[17:55:18] <TheIronSky> ajpiano: it was CSS-related
[17:55:18] <ajpiano> TheIronSky: why are you loading a full html document :)
[17:55:30] <ajpiano> oh, it's working now?
[17:55:34] <TheIronSky> yes
[17:55:42] <DanHakimi> vol7ron, go to w3schools.org
[17:55:52] <vol7ron> ajpiano: the googles may do validation on supplement pages too
[17:55:54] <imsky> DanHakimi: http://i.imgur.com/UYghc.png
[17:56:01] <vol7ron> DanHakimi: it was a joke
[17:56:17] <TheIronSky> ajpiano: I wasn't initially loading a whole html document, but I just wanted to see if it worked first
[17:56:19] <ajpiano> vol7ron: what does it matter
[17:57:02] <DanHakimi> ah
[17:57:33] <DanHakimi> imsky... what... why is your screen so small? and what browser are you using?
[17:57:36] <ajpiano> lol DanHakimi i'm from roslyn
[17:57:54] <imsky> DanHakimi: my screen isn't small, i resized the browser. firefox5
[17:57:55] <Brodingo> i will never die
[17:57:59] <Brodingo> i will never die
[17:58:01] <DanHakimi> ajpiano: Ah, so you recognize my last name?
[17:58:10] <ajpiano> haha yep, did you have cousins or something who went to herricks
[17:58:44] <imsky> a family moment in #jquery
[17:58:53] <DanHakimi> ajpiano: I did for middle school
[17:59:05] <ajpiano> oh dang
[17:59:09] <DanHakimi> I should figure out how to whisper, huh?
[17:59:24] <imsky> forward slash msg
[18:00:08] <Brodingo> sup imsky
[18:00:24] <imsky> sup brodingo
[18:00:30] <imsky> i'm just eating chocolate granola
[18:00:34] <imsky> and coding that jquery
[18:00:38] <vol7ron> ajpiano: the googles ranks well-formed (validated) pages higher than others
[18:01:40] <vol7ron> and i think it's now following javascript for ajax; thus, supplement, dynamically loaded pages should count towards the site score
[18:01:53] <ajpiano> that is a lot of conjecture
[18:02:08] <ajpiano> i don't think having a doctype on the html snippets you consume is a high prioriory item
[18:02:18] <ajpiano> considering you shouldnt' be consuming full html documents at all
[18:02:34] <DanHakimi> so imsky... that thing where they overlap when you hit the back and forth buttons a lot... that's what I'm trying to fix.
[18:02:36] <vol7ron> with lots of pages contending for SEO, are you willing to risk that wager?
[18:02:43] <ajpiano> but yet, yet another reason to not have your site navigation be in a hardcoded html page
[18:02:44] <DanHakimi> how do I go about that?
[18:02:47] <ajpiano> vol7ron: uh
[18:02:50] <ajpiano> yeah, i'd risk it
[18:03:06] <vol7ron> i wouldn't call it .html, if it wasn't a full html page
[18:03:10] <imsky> DanHakimi: depends. are you writing your own jquery or using a plugin
[18:03:17] <ajpiano> it shouldn't be a full html page anyway
[18:03:24] <vol7ron> omg you're retarded
[18:03:29] <vol7ron> lol ;)
[18:03:29] <ajpiano> thanks
[18:03:40] <vol7ron> i think you're just arguing with me :)
[18:03:47] <ajpiano> i'm not
[18:03:53] <DanHakimi> imsky: my own. and I'd like to keep it that way
[18:04:00] <vol7ron> i agree it shouldn't be a full page, but you should call it .txt or something
[18:04:01] <ajpiano> i think it's inane to consume full html documents via ajax in the name of "SEO voodoo"
[18:04:14] <vol7ron> i agree, re-read
[18:04:26] <ajpiano> vol7ron: which is exactly why there should be a backend that actually creates the content dynamically
[18:04:32] <ajpiano> and so deeper geoth the rabbit hole
[18:04:37] <vol7ron> lol
[18:04:51] * vol7ron sips from my Jacky D 
[18:04:57] <imsky> DanHakimi: ok, read up on jquery animation queueing. you should disable it for your animations
[18:05:18] <vol7ron> could someone poll the OSes used in this channel, i'm just curious
[18:06:13] <Chibby_> could anyone please tell me if there is a jquery function to see if a checkbox is checked or not?
[18:06:22] <ajpiano> ?checkboxes
[18:06:22] <bot-t1> As of jQuery 1.6, use .prop("checked") to test checked, and .prop("checked", true or false) to change the state. In jQuery 1.5 you could check the box with .attr("checked","checked") and to uncheck it, do .removeAttr("checked")
[18:07:16] <vol7ron> Chibby_ $('element').attr('checked')
[18:07:18] <Chibby_> thanks
[18:07:33] <ajpiano> nope
[18:07:41] <ajpiano> either .is(":checked") or .prop("checked")
[18:07:48] <vol7ron> sorry my xchat is F'ing up
[18:08:00] <vol7ron> its printing not the top of the window - gotta relog
[18:08:26] <imsky> linux on the desktop any day now
[18:09:05] <ajpiano> DanHakimi, you use a technique called debouncing to prevent the events from piling up when you click quickly, see ?debounce
[18:09:05] <bot-t1> DanHakimi, Ben Alman » jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[18:09:24] <Chibby_> ajpiano: is one faster than the other?
[18:09:46] <vol7ron> ajpiano: attar still works
[18:09:52] <ajpiano> Chibby_: prop("checked") or just actually checking the checked property on the elem directly
[18:09:55] <vol7ron> attr*
[18:10:02] <ajpiano> so do fax machines
[18:10:11] <DanHakimi> thanks
[18:10:45] <vol7ron> i thought prop is reserved for DOM props, not HTML elem attributes, which attr is supposed to be used for
[18:11:02] <ajpiano> no you've got it sort of backwards
[18:11:17] <ajpiano> checked starts as an attribute and then for the rest of it's life it's a property of the dom element
[18:11:30] <ajpiano> like the value attr
[18:11:39] <ajpiano> which does a similar thing
[18:11:53] <ajpiano> and in some cases manipulating the attr works on the property as well, but in other cases it didn't
[18:12:56] <ajpiano> http://www.timmywillison.com/2011/When-to-use-.attr()-and-.prop().html
[18:14:02] <Chibby_> ?radio
[18:14:02] <bot-t1> :radio: Selects all elements of type radio. http://api.jquery.com/radio-selector/
[18:15:43] <vol7ron> yeah i think i read that
[18:16:08] <vol7ron> i think .prop() will evaluate to true/false whereas .attr() evaluates to checked/undefined
[18:16:33] <vol7ron> thus, attr should be used to retrieve the HTML attribute value, should it not?
[18:16:57] <vol7ron> prop should be used for JS/DOM object properties
[18:17:05] <ajpiano> when you're checking if something is checked or not, you want a boolean
[18:17:13] <vol7ron> yes/no
[18:17:33] <vol7ron> how you get it is often as equally important :)
[18:18:12] <vol7ron> but you're right in this case, i'd do .is(':checked') or something like that
[18:18:48] <vol7ron> if you're going to use JavaScript, something like that will help ensure future scalability
[18:48:50] <abjorn> IMSKY
[18:48:52] <abjorn> are you still here?
[18:48:56] <imsky> yeah man

[19:29:06] <bobbobbins> hey, i have a pretty common problem, but i haven't found a good solution for yet...i have a link that you click on and a div pops up...but if the div that link is in reloads, instead of popping up the div when you click the link, it 404s
[19:30:08] <bobbobbins> i was using bind...because i thought that reapplied the action to the link if the page was reloaded, but i guess that is not right
[19:32:51] <K1ng> 1 minute should be setTimeout(AjaxUpdate, 60000); right?
[19:34:56] <bobbobbins> anyone?

[19:37:10] <juni0r19> hi all
[19:37:27] <juni0r19> how can i load jquery from google ?
[19:40:43] <exitdescription> google google jquery
[19:46:46] <juni0r19> cd /
[19:56:15] <yarco> http://paste2.org/p/1588090
[19:58:41] <jkline> yarco: Inside your click handler you are binding a submit handler. Is that really what you mean?
[19:58:59] <jkline> yarco: If you want the form to submit when you click #bt just make #bt type="submit"
[19:59:06] <jkline> and not use javascript at all
[20:00:21] <yarco> jkline: get it. it only bind a handler, wont do submit next...
[20:01:43] <jkline> yarco: correct. You can submit the form with $('#test').submit() which will call the previously bound handlers. However, in this case i'm not sure why you would need to do that.
[20:36:48] <ndss56> how to check if $('#foo').show() is actually showing?
[20:46:18] <ndss56> how to check if $('#foo').show() is actually showing? i want to check if its already showing before i use show().
[20:46:53] <jkline> ndss56: $('#foo').is(':visible')
[20:47:08] <jkline> ndss56: although calling show on a visible element should be safe
[20:47:19] <ndss56> why is there a colon in :visibale?
[20:48:27] <jkline> ndss56: because it is a pseudo selector. is takes a selector so you could also say if ( $('#foo').is('div') ) or if ( $('#foo').is(':input') )
[20:48:44] <jkline> ?is @ndss56
[20:48:45] <bot-t1> ndss56, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector and return true if at least one of these elements matches the selector. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[20:49:12] <jkline> ndss56: http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[20:49:37] <ndss56> jkline: the div example had no colon but the input did. confused.
[20:50:05] <jkline> ndss56: Yes, sorry. I can see why that would be confusing.
[20:50:09] <jkline> div is a type of element
[20:50:12] <jkline> so is input
[20:50:35] <jkline> however, jQuery provides a pseudo selector :input (with a colon) that returns elements of type input as well as elements of type select and textarea and button
[20:50:54] <jkline> Basically jQuery wants to help you find form elements and it knows there are many different types
[20:51:07] <jkline> http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[20:51:17] <jkline> so is('input') would check for a literal <input> element
[20:51:38] <jkline> while is(':input') would also return true for <select> elements
[20:51:51] <jkline> You can do is with classes too, although you might then want hasClass
[20:52:14] <ndss56> ah, very well explained :)
[20:53:15] <jkline> you're welcome. I'm almost ready to go, any other quick question?
[20:53:45] <ndss56> i didnt know there was a type visible?
[20:53:53] <ndss56> as you used colon there
[20:54:09] <jkline> Visible is a pseudo selector, not an element type.
[20:54:15] <ndss56> ndss56: $('#foo').is(':visible')
[20:54:32] <jkline> Check the docs for some important details about what constitutes hidden http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[20:54:52] <ndss56> jkline: another question, where r u going?
[20:55:03] <jkline> heh, home from work :)
[20:55:13] <ndss56> jkline: what work do u do?
[20:55:16] <jkline> in other words, away from a keyboard.
[20:55:22] <jkline> I'm a software developer
[20:55:36] <ndss56> jkline: how long in the business?
[20:57:21] <jkline> ndss56: approximately 7 years
[21:00:07] <ndss56> jkline: cool. have fun at home :)
[21:02:36] <jkline> thanks. Good luck on your project.
[21:31:14] <HelloWorld> anyone know how to make a pointer box? heh, a box that can point to a div onclick
[21:32:11] <Cork> Hellojere: you want to make it your self or reuse something that exist?
[21:33:00] <Cork> that is, what level of control do you need
[21:33:30] <HelloWorld> either way, but i dont know about getting the position of the div and creating a pointerm si u suppose one already made that can be shared
[21:34:04] <Cork> you can use something like beautytip http://www.lullabot.com/files/bt/bt-latest/DEMO/index.html
[21:34:07] <ccmonster> so you just need a box, that when clicked, does something to another div?
[21:34:21] <Cork> Hellojere: or you can use css3 transform and use a simple div
[21:36:34] <HelloWorld> no, i need a box with a pointer to the div area where ive clicked, like a dream or speech bubble type thing
[21:36:49] <HelloWorld> doesnt have to be pretty
[21:37:13] <Cork> HelloWorld: check the url then, it fitts quite well with what your looking for
[21:37:18] <HelloWorld> ahh
[21:37:19] <HelloWorld> nice
[21:37:24] <ccmonster> so if you've clicked somewhere else, you want a box to show what you've clicked?
[21:37:24] <HelloWorld> thnkw
[21:37:39] <ccmonster> sorry if im braindead, but i was just trying to understand
[21:38:49] <devians> when animating with jquery, i'm noticing if i dont have chrome in the foreground for a while, all my animations go at once when i come back, and at that point since the animation is left: "+=160" on left, their left values go kinda nuts. everything slides off screen :( ideas?
[21:40:23] <MagusOTB> Is it possible to make a given selector result in a JQUI button now and in the future?
[21:40:46] <MagusOTB> like, I want all <a class="something"> tags to become buttons, including ones that are inserted after page loading
[21:41:49] <ccmonster> devians, I've heard of this happening
[21:41:57] <ccmonster> something with the animations queing up
[21:42:09] <ccmonster> not sure what he fix is, although queue and dequeue of animations works
[21:42:20] <devians> ccmonster: mmm, its very annoying.
[21:42:22] <ccmonster> for similar animations quirks
[21:42:46] <devians> what, queue up a single animation, fire it, clear queue?
[21:42:57] <ccmonster> something to that affect
[21:43:02] <jtannenbaum> what's the event that triggers when an option of a <select> is selected, even it'
[21:43:18] <jtannenbaum> even if it's the same option that was already selected? .change() doesn't cover that
[21:43:36] <ccmonster> change?
[21:43:39] <ccmonster> i believe jtannenbaum
[21:43:45] <ccmonster> oh.
[21:43:48] <ccmonster> hmm..
[21:44:25] <TonyWanis> ccmonster: I heard you need hosting
[21:44:29] <TonyWanis> Is that true?
[21:44:58] <ccmonster> what? huh? who said that?
[21:45:09] <TonyWanis> Someone
[21:45:12] <TonyWanis> Do you?
[21:45:28] <ccmonster> lol. no, i never mentioned anything about needing hosting. Must have me mixed up with someone else
[21:45:50] <TonyWanis> Ok
[21:45:53] <TonyWanis> Sorry
[21:47:43] <fotoflo> hmm, how do i get all attr()s of an element?
[21:48:51] <Harkins> I have one input[name=radio] - how do I select just the one that's currently checked?
[21:48:58] <ccmonster> console out the jquery object of the elem you are look at
[21:49:04] <ccmonster> $('#myelem')
[21:49:06] <ccmonster> and look in the console
[21:49:13] <ccmonster> should show you everything
[21:49:37] <fotoflo> ccmonster: if i want to get them all dynamically?
[21:51:35] <ccmonster> which attr are you interested in?
[21:52:00] <fotoflo> all of them
[21:52:28] <fotoflo>     var widgets = $("body").find(".widget");
[21:52:28] <fotoflo>     $.each(widgets, function(i){
[21:52:29] <fotoflo>         $(widgets[i]).prepend('<div class = "ui-widget-header">' + $(widgets[i]).children("h2").text() + '</span>');
[21:52:29] <fotoflo>     	$(widgets[i]).children("h2").css({"visibility":"hidden", "float":"right"});
[21:53:06] <fotoflo> i am replacing the first h2 child of each .widget with a div
[21:53:29] <fotoflo> it would be cool if I could grab all the h2 attributes and drop them on the div as well
[21:57:20] <fotoflo> uggh
[21:57:31] <fotoflo> never mind, i just changed my html… better solution
[22:04:12] <cnnr> is there a way to determine if a successful connection between a draggable and a sortable was made? i'm using 'Stop" in the draggable right now, but i need a method to fire only when it was connected to the sortable.
[22:07:55] <ccmonster> did you check out all the events available cnnr ?
[22:08:40] <cnnr> ah, i just checked on the sortable events and i see there is a 'received'. i must have missed that. thank you!
[22:09:22] <ccmonster> np
[22:09:30] <ccmonster> glad you found it :)
[22:15:26] <fotoflo> hmm, still having trouble with lookahead matching
[22:15:32] <fotoflo> >>"Twitter Topic: #android".match(/(?=Twitter Topic:)(.*)/)
[22:16:04] <fotoflo> how do i get it to match '#android' looking ahead at Twitter Topic:
[22:16:05] <fotoflo> ?
[22:18:40] <ccmonster> you want to do a positive lookahead in regex?
[22:18:44] <ccmonster> or a neg lookahead?
[22:19:09] <fotoflo> ccmonster: i want to find rest of the string after "Twitter Topic:"
[22:19:15] <fotoflo> i think that is a positive lookahead
[22:19:23] <ccmonster> what is your goal?
[22:20:04] <fotoflo> for "Twitter Topic: #android".match(/(?=Twitter Topic:)(.*)/) to return $android
[22:20:29] <danheberden> you want the text #android to return $android? :p
[22:20:39] <fotoflo> no because that could be anything
[22:20:44] <fotoflo> but twitter topic: will always be there
[22:21:03] * danheberden was poking fun at the # to $ conversion/typo
[22:21:54] <fotoflo> danheberden: err guess I'm dense
[22:21:58] <fotoflo> hah
[22:22:06] <fotoflo> "a:b".match()  how do i return b? if i know a: will always be there
[22:23:06] <ccmonster> so you just want to capture everything after the first ":"?
[22:23:57] <fotoflo> ": "
[22:24:06] <ccmonster> then get the index of that, slice
[22:24:13] <ccmonster> regex might be more efficient
[22:24:23] <fotoflo> i want to learn the regex
[22:24:27] <ccmonster> ok
[22:24:28] <fotoflo> not just get it done ;-)
[22:24:34] <ccmonster> ahhh
[22:24:37] <ccmonster> i see i see :)
[22:24:44] <gnarf>  /Twitter Topic: (.*)/
[22:25:06] <danheberden> haha gnarf
[22:25:12] <gnarf> ?js  /Twitter Topic: (.*)/.match("Twitter Topic: Why are we explaining regexp again?");
[22:25:13] <danheberden> i was waiting for ccmonster to do it
[22:25:13] <bot-t1> gnarf: TypeError: /Twitter Topic: (.*)/.match is not a function
[22:25:24] <gnarf> ?js  /Twitter Topic: (.*)/.exec("Twitter Topic: Why are we explaining regexp again?");
[22:25:25] <bot-t1> gnarf: ["Twitter Topic: Why are we explaining regexp again?", "Why are we explaining regexp again?"]
[22:25:25] <gnarf> sry
[22:25:29] <gnarf> did that backwards
[22:25:30] <ccmonster> haha, why you waiting on me?
[22:25:42] <ccmonster> i am struggling getting this damn ntfs drie to mount.
[22:25:48] <ccmonster> drive*
[22:25:53] <danheberden> i donno - didn't want to take over :)
[22:25:56] <ccmonster> i want to rip it out and strangle it by it's sata cable
[22:25:57] <danheberden> in case you were learning too
[22:26:32] <ccmonster> ah, no. I can do lookaaheads, although im rusty. haven't done them in jquery, but regex is regex , for the most part
[22:26:42] <danheberden> and fotoflo if you don't check for a falsy match first, we'll find you
[22:26:43] <ccmonster> im usually in the 'get it done mode', so he threw me for a loop lol
[22:27:27] <fotoflo> whats a falsy match?
[22:27:57] <danheberden> var a = /opic:\s(.*)$/.exec( "this wont work" ); a;
[22:28:02] <danheberden> ?eval var a = /opic:\s(.*)$/.exec( "this wont work" ); a;
[22:28:02] <bot-t1> danheberden: null
[22:28:34] <fotoflo> 看不懂
[22:28:36] <fotoflo> wtf is that?
[22:28:36] <danheberden> ?eval var a = /opic:\s(.*)$/.exec( "this wont work" ); if ( a ) { a[1]; }
[22:28:37] <bot-t1> danheberden: undefined
[22:29:11] <fotoflo> a = "Twitter Topic: lalalal".match(/Twitter Topic: (.*)/)
[22:29:12] <danheberden> make sure it worked before you go trying to access [1] on it
[22:29:16] <fotoflo> do i always have to get a[1]
[22:29:25] <fotoflo> ?
[22:29:38] <danheberden> you could do a[0], but that would be kinda silly
[22:29:47] <fotoflo> hah
[22:29:48] <fotoflo> ok
[22:29:54] <fotoflo> ?eval
[22:29:54] <bot-t1> fotoflo: Syntax: ? eval <javascript code>
[22:30:01] <fotoflo> ok so you were just talking to a bot
[22:30:06] <ccmonster> haha
[22:30:10] <danheberden> bot-t1 'n me go WAY back
[22:30:16] <danheberden> ?danheberden
[22:30:17] <bot-t1> <danheberden> but +1 on fat models
[22:30:19] <ccmonster> he doesn't always talk back, even when you need him to :)
[22:30:21] <fotoflo> did bot-t1 have your baby?
[22:30:25] <ccmonster> hahaah danheberden
[22:30:34] <gnarf> ?2bagsofdicks
[22:30:35] <bot-t1> StoneCypher: miketaylr: don't talk to me. i'm busy eating two bags of dicks.

[22:30:50] <gnarf> ?csb
[22:30:50] <bot-t1> cool story, bro. http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif

[22:31:07] * gnarf hugs bot-t1
[22:31:07] * bot-t1 hugs gnarf back
[22:31:18] <danheberden> bot-t1, you'll love me forever, right?
[22:31:18] <bot-t1> danheberden, Yes.
[22:31:43] <gnarf> bot-t1: are you and danheberden going to be married
[22:31:44] <bot-t1> gnarf, Don't count on it.
[22:31:51] <danheberden> we have an open relationship
[22:31:53] <fotoflo> var a = /opic:\s(.*)$/.exec( "this wont work" ); if ( a ) { a[1]; }     you need to put an else in here?
[22:32:00] <danheberden> ( and he knows about us )
[22:32:06] <fotoflo> or ?
[22:32:12] <fotoflo> just go use it and crash if its not there?!
[22:32:16] <danheberden> fotoflo depends, do you need to do something if there's no math?
[22:32:28] <gnarf> ?101
[22:32:29] <bot-t1> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[22:32:47] <danheberden> s/math/match/
[22:32:56] <danheberden> you'd think i'd been drinkin tonight
[22:33:30] <gnarf> danheberden: if he's not understanding regexp, i think the elegance of inline perl / sed expressions is wasted
[22:33:33] <gnarf> ;)
[22:33:47] <danheberden> gnarf i was kinda hoping for that
[22:33:53] * danheberden has an evil side
[22:33:57] <ccmonster> ....and we'd be right?
[22:33:58] <ccmonster> :)
[22:34:18] <fotoflo> topic = $("#twitterTopic").text().match(/Twitter Topic: (.*)/)[1];
[22:34:22] <fotoflo> oh yah
[22:34:33] <gnarf> if the match is null, that explodes with an error
[22:34:35] <danheberden> fotoflo i will find you and beat you if you use that in production code
[22:34:42] <gnarf> thats what danheberden was talking about
[22:34:42] <ccmonster> are you new to regex in general fotoflo ?
[22:34:47] <ccmonster> hahaha danheberden
[22:35:13] <fotoflo> danheberden: why?
[22:35:14] <fotoflo> \
[22:35:34] <ccmonster> the reason gnarf  just mentioned. Null will blow that up. and that would be no bueno.
[22:35:37] <danheberden> ?eval /nou/.exec("whatever")[1]
[22:35:38] <bot-t1> danheberden: TypeError: /nou/.exec("whatever") is null
[22:35:42] <danheberden> THATS WHY
[22:35:51] <raiun> what is the event for choosing a file from a input['file'] ?
[22:36:10] <fotoflo> ccmonster: pretty new… I have leared several programming languages half way, and then ran out of time… so never got good at them
[22:36:28] <gnarf> raiun: change ?
[22:36:40] <ccmonster> ah.
[22:36:44] <danheberden> gnarf++
[22:36:55] <ccmonster> well the good thing is most are very similar :)
[22:37:04] <coldhead> ?g cookie monster delete cookies @ ccmonster

[22:37:20] <ccmonster> lol
[22:37:22] <fotoflo> so what if its null? first of all, this is on a chrome extension. so its only reading user input here, and I initialize $twitterTopic on firstRun()
[22:37:25] <danheberden> ?ud cookie monster
[22:37:30] <bot-t1> danheberden, COOKIE monster - A furry blue monster from Sesame Street who takes out his sexual frustration on baked goods.
[22:37:37] <fotoflo> yes, picking up javascript and jquery was really easy this time
[22:37:41] <ccmonster> lol @ sexual frustratin
[22:37:45] <fotoflo> just a lot of API to learn...
[22:38:12] <ccmonster> be a good programmer, do yourself a favor, and eval that and dont let it blow up :)
[22:38:14] <danheberden> jquery is super easy
[22:38:17] <danheberden> puts out on the first date
[22:38:20] <ccmonster> best practices homie :)
[22:38:22] <ccmonster> hahaah danheberden
[22:38:34] <gnarf> dirty slut
[22:38:40] <danheberden> fotoflo always think about the what if
[22:38:43] <danheberden> like, you did that regex match
[22:38:45] <ccmonster> thats how you like em sometime
[22:38:46] <danheberden> but what if it doesn't match
[22:38:52] <danheberden> you gotta always be thinking 'bout that shit
[22:38:55] <ccmonster> if you need some strange, jquerys' ur girl
[22:38:59] <fotoflo> its ALWAYS going to match
[22:39:15] <fotoflo> Twitter Topic: is hard coded into the HTML and never changed
[22:39:43] <danheberden> if it's hard coded, why aren't you just wrapping it in a span
[22:39:48] <danheberden> and getting it via a selector
[22:39:50] <ccmonster> :)
[22:39:54] <ccmonster> beat me to it
[22:40:06] <raiun> gnarf: how to get the value from the input['file'] once its set?
[22:40:10] <ccmonster> he's forcing himself to learn regex i assume?
[22:40:24] <fotoflo> hmm
[22:40:25] <danheberden> raiun http://html5demos.com/file-api-simpl
[22:40:28] <fotoflo> ok ill try that ;-)
[22:40:52] <raiun> danheberden: this site isn't html5
[22:41:00] <fotoflo> ah
[22:41:02] <fotoflo> yeah
[22:41:07] <fotoflo> I'm not doing that for a good reason
[22:41:15] <fotoflo> anyway
[22:41:17] <ccmonster> ok
[22:41:19] <fotoflo> this is going to work
[22:41:41] <ccmonster> well , def learn to null check that mess and save yourself the trouble the next time you look at that code for reference
[22:41:49] <fotoflo> ok
[22:42:00] <ccmonster> because your going to look back and that and be like "hmm... i know i did a lookahead in js somewhere...'
[22:42:19] <ccmonster> then trip yourself up next time
[22:43:24] <ccmonster> gl
[22:43:58] <danheberden> and remember, don't forget the face of your father
[22:44:11] <fotoflo> ok
[22:44:14] <fotoflo> so
[22:44:28] <fotoflo> I've been trying to find a good time to learn the tertiary operator...
[22:44:44] <danheberden> you mean ternary?
[22:44:49] <fotoflo> oldTopic ?  oldTopic = oldTopic[1] : oldTopic = "AwesomeTab";
[22:44:49] <gnarf> you mean the conditional operator?
[22:45:03] <fotoflo> the  ternary
[22:45:07] <fotoflo> conditional
[22:45:09] <fotoflo> yeah
[22:45:13] <gnarf> its not "the ternary operator" it is "a ternary operator"
[22:45:14] <danheberden> so learn it :) BOOOM done
[22:45:23] <gnarf> it is called that because it takes 3 arguments
[22:45:29] <gnarf> a?b:c
[22:45:30] <danheberden> ?g jqfundamentals
[22:45:31] <bot-t1> danheberden, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[22:45:38] <danheberden> i like unary operators

[22:45:58] <gnarf> ?g stackoverflow ternary operator conditional
[22:45:59] <danheberden> none of this ? or : bizness
[22:46:32] <gnarf> danheberden: you'd prefer condition && value || value ? :)
[22:46:46] <danheberden> haha, no, just +"3"
[22:46:51] <fotoflo> 	oldTopic = $("#twitterTopic").text().match(/Twitter Topic: (.*)/);
[22:46:51] <fotoflo> 	oldTopic ?  oldTopic = oldTopic[1] : oldTopic = "AwesomeTab";
[22:46:52] <gnarf> oh unary
[22:46:53] <gnarf> sry
[22:46:55] <fotoflo> is this how it works?
[22:46:58] <danheberden> :p
[22:47:04] <gnarf> fotoflo: seriously
[22:47:16] <danheberden> here it comes
[22:47:27] <ccmonster> dun dun dun
[22:47:35] <danheberden> get ready to SHORT CIRCUIT THAT BITCH
[22:47:50] <ccmonster> i need to start writing things in the revealing module pattern
[22:47:52] <gnarf> ?101 @fotoflo
[22:48:01] <gnarf> I'm pretty sure it mentions ternary somewhere in there
[22:48:03] <gnarf> if not
[22:48:08] <gnarf> a ? b : c
[22:48:15] <gnarf> if a then b else c
[22:48:21] <danheberden> but even that example
[22:49:04] <gnarf> oldTopic = match ? match[1] : "OMG YAY!"
[22:49:07] <ccmonster> var blah = zay ? 1:0;
[22:49:07] <ccmonster> ?
[22:49:12] <jankidudel> hi, why $('#input').val('newvalue')  doesn't work, but  $('#input').attr('value', 'newvalue') does ?
[22:49:23] <danheberden> ?eval var m = /nou(.*)/.exec( "nou dude"), result = m ? m[1] : "FU"; result;
[22:49:23] <bot-t> danheberden: " dude"
[22:49:25] <gnarf> ccmonster: thats doable with unary operators
[22:49:45] <gnarf> ccmonster: blah = +!!zay
[22:49:57] <Cork> jankidudel: that that should be the other way around actually, do you have an example?
[22:49:59] <gnarf> danheberden pro tip there
[22:50:15] <ccmonster> hm, not used the unary

[22:51:28] <danheberden> just got done writing that chapter, lol
[22:51:48] <jankidudel> Cork,  doesn't need an example, just i'm setting the value of input  "Enter email", then when user clicks, I make $('#input').val(''), then via AJAx, send this info, but it appears to be the same = "Enter your email"

[22:55:05] <bot-t> function _(l){return l+(_+l)[11-((_._=(_._?_._:!_)+1)%(1+1)?!1:1+1+1+1+1)]}_(_(_('')))
[22:55:14] <danheberden> ?eval function _(l){return l+(_+l)[11-((_._=(_._?_._:!_)+1)%(1+1)?!1:1+1+1+1+1)]}_(_(_('')))
[22:55:14] <bot-t> danheberden: "lol"
[22:56:00] <jankidudel> Cork, yes, but... you can see yourself, if you use firebug or so that the actual html attribute value is the same, "Enter email"
[22:56:16] <Cork> jankidudel: thats expected
[22:56:29] <Cork> jankidudel: the html attribute doens't matter its whats in the dom
[22:57:14] <jankidudel> Cork, ok, but then i use  $('#myform').serializeArray, and then shit happens, I can't send right values via AJAx
[22:58:07] <gnarf> serializeArray uses .val()
[22:58:19] <gnarf> which like, is the "right" way to get a value
[22:58:32] <gnarf> if you guys are even uttering about .attr("value") you should stop
[22:58:37] <gnarf> and use .val()
[22:58:48] <raiun> anybody know how to remove the c:\fakepath\ for file inputs in chrome
[22:58:49] <danheberden> and serializeObject uses .val() too :)
[22:58:59] <danheberden> (not a jq api method)
[22:59:00] <raiun> i'm using this.value.replace(/^C:\\fakepath\\/, ''); but its not working
[22:59:01] <Cork> jankidudel: again, wfm http://jsfiddle.net/kPqYA/1/
[22:59:33] <gnarf> raiun: the value of that field is unpredictable
[22:59:43] <raiun> but in chrome
[22:59:48] <raiun> it always starts with c:\fakepath\
[22:59:49] <danheberden> particularly for those of us that don't have 'c' drives
[23:00:16] <gnarf> raiun: are you writing a chrome only piece of code?
[23:00:16] <raiun> im not good with regex, ideally id like to remove everything before the last slash just to show the filename
[23:00:41] <raiun> well chrome is the only browser ive noticed this with
[23:00:42] <gnarf> ?js "omg/this/is/a/path/to/a/file.jpg".split("/").pop()
[23:00:42] <bot-t> gnarf: "file.jpg"
[23:00:45] <coldhead> still on floppy disks danheberden?
[23:00:51] <danheberden> haha, gnarf - beat me to it
[23:00:58] <danheberden> coldhead yeah, i only have a: and b:
[23:01:11] <coldhead> i'm saving for b:
[23:01:16] <gnarf> ?js "omg/this/is/a/path\to\a\file.jpg".split(/[\/\\]/).pop()
[23:01:17] <bot-t> gnarf: "path\toa\file.jpg"
[23:01:19] <coldhead> gonna a get a 3.5er
[23:01:21] <gnarf> oops
[23:01:29] <gnarf> ?js "omg/this/is/a/path\\to\\a\\file.jpg".split(/[\/\\]/).pop()
[23:01:30] <bot-t> gnarf: "file.jpg"
[23:01:36] <gnarf> i forgot to escape the \ in the string
[23:01:38] <gnarf> sorry
[23:01:44] <dr0id> excused
[23:01:56] <danheberden> BAN HAMMER
[23:02:06] <dr0id> onu ?
[23:02:11] <raiun> i dont see the difference
[23:02:11] <danheberden> coldhead, i heard they're making a high density version of those
[23:02:30] <dr0id> take version numbers to the next level bro
[23:02:34] <dr0id> Mozilla takes Firefox version numbers to the next level… by removing them
[23:04:20] <gnarf> didn't chrome do that a while back?
[23:15:03] <fotoflo> hmm well it ended up better if i just added a span and got the text() instead of all that regex :-!
[23:17:49] <fotoflo> 	$("#twitterTopic").append('<input type = "text" id = "newTwitterTopic" size="31" maxlength="30" value = "' + oldTopic + '"  /><img src = "plus.png" onclick = "changeTwitterTopic() />');
[23:18:03] <gnarf> oh my god
[23:18:19] <gnarf> dude, onclick is so 1994
[23:18:20] <fotoflo> but is there a reason why this input is losing focus as soon as i click it, and the plus isn't showing up?
[23:18:37] <gnarf> maybe the malformed html?
[23:18:40] <gnarf> the missing "
[23:18:46] <gnarf> ?inline
[23:18:46] <bot-t> don't use inline event handlers; instead, use jQuery's bind() or delegate() method in an external JavaScript file. Inline handlers are harder to debug, aren't reusable, are harder to maintain, bloat your HTML, and violate the separation of content design principle. Also - jQuery can't normalize your event, leaving you unsure if you can reliably stopPropagation(), or access e.which.
[23:19:48] <fotoflo> i triple checked and didn't find a missing "!
[23:21:55] <gnarf> fotoflo: check again
[23:22:53] <fotoflo> damn
[23:22:54] <fotoflo> haha
[23:23:01] <fotoflo> was looking in the wrong place
[23:23:30] <MaxMeents> out of curiousity, if you were trying to assemble a small team of developers to work on a web app. and had the backing of a few investors, how would you go about finding said people?
[23:24:14] <MaxMeents> ok, not out of curiosity, been trying to figure it out. would appreciate any thoughts
[23:31:35] <fotoflo> gnarf: oddly that's fixed, but I'm still losing focus when i click on it
[23:58:09] <whateverb> hi! how can I make this validate my form? to check if any required field is empty or equal to defvalue
[23:58:10] <whateverb> http://jsbin.com/odedug/edit#preview
[23:58:20] <whateverb> and not submitting then
