[00:15:14] <_genuser_> $( ".RigDIV" ).each( function(div) {
[00:15:31] <_genuser_> is "div" a reference to the actual div?
[00:15:46] <_genuser_> if not, how to get reference to the actual div inside the function?
[00:16:19] <jphase> _genuser_: $('.RigDIV').each(function(index, div){
[00:16:47] <jphase> you can also use $(this) inside the loop to reference the div
[00:16:52] <_genuser_> jphase: hey man. ok, so index is what I was seeing when I printed div.
[00:17:04] <jphase> yeah
[00:17:17] <_genuser_> so inside .each() if I do $(this), it will give me the item then.
[00:17:24] <jphase> yes
[00:17:26] <_genuser_> so no need to even declare index,div then correct?
[00:17:50] <jphase> not needed, no, just another way to use .each
[00:18:13] <_genuser_> nice, thanks. :)
[00:18:32] <_genuser_> so this app just keep geting more and more convoluted, lol.
[00:19:06] <_genuser_> I'm now rendering blank divs for each rig found, and doing to do client side $.post() to retrieve status of each rig which pings back the same php script.
[00:22:57] <jeremib> is there an easy way to get an array data values from my selector?  Something like this? $j('.savedresult_row').data('parcel-id').toArray()
[00:23:27] <shoky> jeremib: yes, with .map
[00:23:50] <jeremib> shoky: perfect, I'll check that out
[00:24:04] <shoky> jeremib:   $j('.savedresult_row').map(function() { return $(this).data('parcel-id') }).get()
[00:25:00] <jeremib> awesome, thanks shoky!
[00:25:03] <Cork> uh
[00:25:19] <Cork> shoky: please use $.map() instead in those cases
[00:25:56] <shoky> it kills the chain :\
[00:25:57] <Cork> $j.map($j('.savedresult_row'), function(elm) { return $(elm).data('parcel-id'); });
[00:26:21] <Cork> shoky: well at least you arn't generating a jquery wrapper around the strings
[00:26:46] <Cork> jeremib: ^
[00:27:15] <jeremib> is that better performance?
[00:27:21] <jeremib> curious as to the difference
[00:27:58] <Cork> jeremib: $j().map will take what you return from the function
[00:28:05] <Cork> and wrap it in a new jquery object
[00:28:17] <Cork> and then .get() is ran on that object to remove the wrapper
[00:28:35] <Cork> $j.map() will just give you the array straight of
[00:28:40] <Cork> so no need to unwrap it
[00:28:44] <jeremib> Ah, that makes sense
[00:28:52] <Cork> jeremib: the unwrapping isn't very time consuming
[00:28:58] <Cork> but it will generate extra gc
[00:29:12] <jeremib> thanks for the explanation
[00:32:29] <_genuser_> $( ".rigdiv" ).each( function(index.div){ } );
[00:32:54] <Cork> function(index.div) isn't valid js
[00:33:09] <_genuser_> inside this, can't one do   $(div +" .another_div")
[00:33:15] <_genuser_> Cork: I mistyped the , as .
[00:33:27] <Cork> and no you can't
[00:33:42] <Cork> you can do $(div).find('.another_div') thougjh
[00:33:46] <Cork> *though
[00:34:12] <Cork> you can also do $(this).find('.another_div')
[00:34:14] <_genuser_> oh nice. thank you. :)
[00:34:19] <Cork> and skip those acguments
[00:34:25] <Cork> *arguments
[00:35:03] <_genuser_> .find works better. have having to concatenate names like div + " " + another_name.
[00:35:24] <Cork> _genuser_: div is a dom element
[00:35:26] <Cork> not a string
[00:35:32] <Cork> you can't concat it
[00:35:59] <Cork> what exactly are you trying to do?
[00:36:22] <_genuser_> right, makes sense. .find works better. but then again could I have done, $(div.attr("id")+" .another_class")?
[00:36:39] <_genuser_> as to what I'm trying to do.
[00:37:00] <Cork> _genuser_: ya, but that is quite ugly
[00:37:07] <xec> div isn't a jquery object, and .attr() is a jquery method
[00:37:18] <Cork> ah missed $(div).attr()
[00:37:32] <Cork> but ya, you really shouldn't do it like that
[00:37:33] <_genuser_> 1) server side creates <div id="Rig1" data-rig-ip="192.168.0.10">bunch of tabular data</div>  2) client side uses .each() and use the ips and pings each server for status.
[00:37:43] <_genuser_> and then populate loooooooooooots of tabular data all client side.
[00:37:49] <xec> you can get the id with this.id
[00:38:01] <_genuser_> xec: nice. :)
[00:38:12] <Cork> but if you already have the element why use the id to select it?!?
[00:38:57] <_genuser_> Cork: multiple <div id="Rig#"></div> tags
[00:39:08] <Cork> _genuser_: that isn't valid html
[00:39:17] <Cork> _genuser_: id's HAVE TO be unique
[00:39:23] <_genuser_> dynamic number of rigs. there culd be 10 for example.
[00:39:31] <_genuser_> # meant a unique id number in it's place.
[00:39:39] <Cork> and you can't even select anything but the first id in the tree
[00:39:51] <xec> to get the Ip you can do this.dataset.rigIp but it's not supported in IE10 or older ;D
[00:39:51] <Cork> _genuser_: sounds like you shouldn't be using id=""
[00:40:10] <_genuser_> Cork: I also added a class name so I could use the class name to select them all and use .each().     :)
[00:40:21] <Cork> _genuser_: the id is still invalid
[00:40:36] <Cork> so i suggest using data-id="" or something instead
[00:40:46] <_genuser_> Cork: id is invalid? how so.
[00:40:46] <xec> Cork: he meant the # is a number
[00:40:57] <Cork> _genuser_: cause you have more then one element with the same id
[00:40:58] <xec> Cork: not that all the IDs are literal "Rig#"
[00:40:59] <_genuser_> Cork: <div id="Rig1"></div>  <div id="Rig2"></div>
[00:41:15] <_genuser_> right, what he said.
[00:41:23] <_genuser_> so id's will be unique in the end.
[00:41:37] <xec> but are you using the ID for anything?
[00:42:17] <_genuser_> right, so using the class, I'll select them and use .each(). inside each I'll query for the data-rig-ip to $.post() a query request for the rig.
[00:42:24] <Cork> _genuser_: if so then i still don't understand why you arn't using the element you already have
[00:42:59] <_genuser_> xec: then still inside the .each(), I'll use the id="Rig1" bit and pull it's children to populate all teh tabular data.
[00:43:01] <Cork> grabbing the id of the element and then selecting the same element by the id again is kinda...
[00:43:48] <_genuser_> Cork: no, wait. let me explain actual logic. my qusetions may have confused the matters.
[00:44:23] <_genuser_> Cork: use class with .each to select them all. use id to access individual ones and query data-rig-ip attribute and then still using id, pull child objects and populate data.
[00:44:45] <shoky> remove all ids from the picture and you're golden
[00:45:05] <Cork> _genuser_: i don't see where you need the id
[00:45:20] <_genuser_> I see. you're both saying use $(this) and access teh element. ID isn't needed.
[00:45:20] <shoky> $(this).find('.myclass')
[00:45:25] <Cork> ya
[00:45:37] <_genuser_> ok, I see. good point. thanks for saving me some clutter in the html.
[00:45:45] <_genuser_> id's are gone.
[00:45:58] * xec sits on shoky
[00:46:11] <_genuser_> lol, you're sitting on him?
[00:46:26] <xec> yeah i figure he needed a good sitting on
[00:46:28] * shoky reaching for air
[00:47:09] <_genuser_> kinda feel those div's are naked without an id.
[00:47:26] <xec> kinky
[00:47:28] <_genuser_> but hehe, woohoo those div's are skinny dipping in jquery!!!
[00:47:43] <shoky> woah there
[00:47:45] <xec> are they siblings too?
[00:47:50] <jphase> ew
[00:48:00] <jphase> naked siblings sounds rural
[00:48:18] <_genuser_> ewww
[00:48:22] <fschuindt> Guys, any help here? I am stuck since yesterday :/: https://gist.github.com/fschuindt/6f1a8482afa964057a4b
[00:49:37] * Cork gives shoky a harisen defent your self! :D
[00:49:48] <Cork> *defend
[00:50:28] <Cork> fschuindt: you need to ask a question if you want help
[00:50:32] <shoky> wat
[00:50:50] <fschuindt> Cork: okay
[00:50:54] <shoky> fschuindt: your loop seems wrong
[00:51:02] <shoky> the for loop i mean
[00:51:18] <shoky> not sure what you're trying to do there.. but seems pretty wrong
[00:52:07] <xec> i'm with shoky on this
[00:52:46] <fschuindt> shoky: I have two arrays, need to compare them and get the different ones because they are new messages
[00:53:07] <shoky> why is i going from 1 to  <= diff_num
[00:53:10] <shoky> why  server_messages[i+cached_messages.length]   ?
[00:53:35] <shoky> oh
[00:53:39] <xec> actually i think i get it
[00:53:44] <xec> a bit clunky but ye
[00:53:45] <shoky> sorry its <= diff_num  i misread that
[00:53:55] <fschuindt> hehe
[00:54:10] <Cork> fschuindt: btw you REALLY shouldn't be using setInterval for the ajax trigger
[00:54:22] <Cork> if the connection becomes slow you will run over your self
[00:54:26] <hellothere> morning anyone knows of a good markdown editor plugin?
[00:54:29] <shoky> i should sleep
[00:54:35] <fschuindt> Cork: what do you recommend?
[00:54:51] <xec> make it a recursive call in the done callback
[00:54:51] <Cork> fschuindt: use setTimeout at the complete callback
[00:54:53] <xec> with a timeout
[00:54:55] <xec> right
[00:55:10] <fschuindt> huuum, nice
[00:55:18] <fschuindt> taking notes
[00:55:27] <jphase> hellothere: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+markdown+editor+plugin
[00:55:38] <Cork> jphase: lol
[00:55:41] <xec> but unless the ajax is taking 2+ seconds it's not what's causing the issue
[00:56:03] <Cork> what is the issue then?
[00:56:06] <hellothere> jphase: i ve done that for a quite long time now and i havent bump into anyone apart from a bootstrap one which needs version 3 to work
[00:56:11] <xec> fschuindt: why do you start at 1 instead of 0?
[00:56:14] <shoky> actually i still don't understand why i is from 1 to <= diff_num
[00:56:45] <fschuindt> xec: To add with the cached_messages.length
[00:56:46] <jphase> hellothere: what's wrong with the first one?
[00:56:47] <shoky> (arrays are 0-indexed)
[00:56:48] <xec> fschuindt: .length is going to be 1 more than the last index
[00:56:59] <shoky> lets say cached_messages.length is 0
[00:57:10] <fschuindt> it will never run
[00:57:17] <shoky> so 1 to <= server_messages.length
[00:57:19] <xec> fschuindt: so to get the first new item you would do 0 + length of old
[00:57:22] <shoky> sure it would
[00:57:52] <fschuindt> My code is a mess
[00:57:53] <shoky> loop from 0 to < length   not 1 to <= length
[00:57:58] <shoky> very very basic
[00:57:58] <xec> yeah
[00:58:06] <hellothere> jphase: tryed to install it and its way too heavy, it uses a lot of resources for some weird reason i just want a simple editor like wysigw that is for markdown and it doesnt uses that many resources :)
[00:58:25] <fschuindt> the real problem is how to compare two arrays and get the diffrence
[00:58:42] <xec> fschuindt: try it and see, if it still doesnt work, console.log() both the arrays and the numbers and see if the math adds up
[00:59:03] <Cork> fschuindt: actually i think what you want is for(var i = cached_messages.length; i < server_messages.length; i++) {}
[00:59:13] <Cork> then you can just use i in the loop
[00:59:24] <Cork> no need for the +cached_messages.length
[00:59:36] <shoky> +1
[00:59:37] <fschuindt> cool
[00:59:38] <xec> yeah, much better
[00:59:52] <shoky> +1 as in i vote +1
[01:00:00] <shoky> just so we're clear.
[01:00:10] <fschuindt> shoky ty to be clear haha
[01:00:45] <Cork> fschuindt: also are you intentionally duplicating the old html?
[01:00:51] <Cork>  html = html + "<p>" + message["content"] + "</p>"; <--
[01:00:54] <Cork> you never clear html
[01:01:03] <jphase> hellothere: there's some stuff out there but a lot of them are very complicated or bloated. redactor was one I liked but that recently became a paid version. I suggest you look into "content editable" and making your own if things like raptor editor, tinymce, etc. etc. are not going to work for you. I started making one since redactor became paid :\
[01:01:04] <Cork> opps
[01:01:05] <Cork> you do
[01:01:34] <fschuindt> :P
[01:01:47] <Cork> i would prob have use local variables instead
[01:01:50] <Cork> but what ever
[01:02:40] <hellothere> jphase: ye thats what i am thinking of jphase it seems like ill have to do that thanks anyways for the help. appreciated :)
[01:03:56] <shoky> ok Cork googling didn't help, whatt's harisen defend yourself? :P
[01:04:27] <fschuindt> Hey guys, Cork, xec, shoky, thank you
[01:04:38] <xec> it's a japanese paper fan
[01:04:39] <shoky> yw
[01:04:44] <_genuser_> i hate this project already.
[01:04:49] <Cork> shoky: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperFanOfDoom
[01:04:52] <xec> you know, the foldable thingy
[01:04:56] <fschuindt> My code is working now,  I will try to improve removing the set interval
[01:06:11] <shoky> i see, thx Cork ;]
[01:06:54] <xec> fschuindt: no need to have two getJSON calls, they do the same really
[01:07:20] <fschuindt> xec: yeah, I will improve it too, its just a scratch :P
[01:07:28] <bigbugjava> Hi there, I need some help figure this one out, http://jsfiddle.net/rEgJG/1/ - the first function, works great and fancybox is closed, the secand one is almost the same, but fancybox gives this error - "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'close' of undefined" , how does that makes sence?
[01:07:35] <Cork> fschuindt: i would do it something like this http://jsfiddle.net/76RJf/1/
[01:08:38] <Cork> and actually cached_messages could be a number instead of an array
[01:08:57] <fschuindt> Cork: you son of a! really nice man, thank you :D
[01:09:05] <fschuindt> haha
[01:09:46] <Cork> hmm and actually
[01:09:55] <Cork> you could simplify this a lot more
[01:10:42] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/76RJf/2/ ?
[01:11:05] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/76RJf/3/
[01:11:13] <Cork> heh ay
[01:11:18] <xec> :D
[01:11:32] <Cork> except for the cache array
[01:12:39] <xec> yeah you're only using the count anyway
[01:12:48] <xec> very nice cork, +1 for the slice too
[01:13:22] <xec> +1 as in I vote +1, just to clarify ;D
[01:13:23] <effortDee_> moin moinm
[01:13:41] <effortDee_> im using https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie and wish to do a couple of things but need some advice on where to begin
[01:13:50] <effortDee_> im wanting to start a cookie as a user registers on a website
[01:14:04] <effortDee_> and then another cookie for when a user buys something at the checkout
[01:16:54] <bigbugjava> Cork ha?
[01:16:59] <xec> effortDee_: the url you linked seem to explain how to set a cookie... what's stopping you? :)
[01:17:07] <bigbugjava> lopl
[01:17:08] <bigbugjava> lol
[01:17:15] <effortDee_> lol :D
[01:17:24] <effortDee_> i've never set up a cookie before
[01:17:26] <effortDee_> but im working on this
[01:17:27] <effortDee_> :)
[01:17:29] <effortDee_> i should be ok
[01:18:28] <Cork> bigbugjava: don't ever EVER use strings for setTimeout
[01:19:19] <bigbugjava> Cork alright
[01:19:24] <bigbugjava> so lets say I remove the timeout
[01:19:27] <bigbugjava> still same error
[01:19:49] <Cork> bigbugjava: are you sure you have loaded fancybox?
[01:20:14] <bigbugjava> yeah it works in the first function
[01:20:18] <bigbugjava> thats whats weird
[01:21:04] <bigbugjava> the fancybox closed with timeout perfect, looks and works great, secand funtion mess it up, weird
[01:21:07] <Cork> parent.$.fancybox.close() ?
[01:21:24] <bigbugjava> tried everything, retrying what you said
[01:21:44] <Cork> as i don't know the context can't say what you need
[01:23:26] <bigbugjava> Cork can I call fancybox by triggered href ID?
[01:23:41] <bigbugjava> $('#EventForm').fancybox ?
[01:23:58] <Cork> yes
[01:24:53] <Cork> bigbugjava: though it doesn't look like that one can call functions
[01:25:43] <Cork> meaning as far as i can tell $.fancybox is how you control it after you've opened it
[01:26:27] <bigbugjava> yeah
[01:26:43] <bigbugjava> maybe because I have another fancybox that opens that fancybox
[01:26:44] <bigbugjava> lol
[01:27:07] <Cork> might not be supported
[01:27:12] <Cork> donno, never used fancybox
[01:27:32] <Cork> (i usually don't use a plugin when i need a simple dialog like fancybox)
[01:31:25] <bigbugjava> alright, thx Cork!
[01:40:34] <xKraty> what you think it's best way for uncheck a checkbox?
[01:41:55] <xec> $(".myCheckbox").prop("checked", false)
[01:42:22] <xKraty> i was going to use removeProp()
[01:42:59] <xKraty> but for some reason none of thoose working :|
[01:43:20] <Cork> xKraty: are you doing it in a click handler?
[01:43:21] <xec> you want to remove the possibility of a checkbox to be checked? :)
[01:43:47] <xKraty> Cork: no i has another function that have to uncheck a #checkbox
[01:44:01] <Cork> then $(".myCheckbox").prop("checked", false) should work
[01:44:36] <xKraty> xec: lol no, it should remove checked="checked"|checked="true"|checked
[01:44:49] <Cork> xKraty: no the attribute doesn't matter
[01:44:55] <xec> you're talking about html instead of dom
[01:44:56] <Cork> you want to change the prop not the attr
[01:45:27] <xKraty> yeah but always worked .prop('checked', false)
[01:46:05] <xec> i'm confused, did the .prop() call not work?
[01:46:12] <xec> do you have a demo?
[01:46:15] <xKraty> no
[01:46:25] <xKraty> one sec
[01:46:50] <xKraty> http://95.228.142.211/christian/waddly/public/
[01:46:58] <xKraty> can you see it?
[01:47:48] <xec> xKraty: http://jsfiddle.net/mjQEA/
[01:48:00] <xKraty> nvm now works -.-
[01:48:28] <xKraty> probably i type then
[01:49:05] <xKraty> thanks anyway
[01:55:10] <_genuser_> I'm hating this app already. so much crap to move client side.
[01:55:27] <_genuser_> dynamically adding divs for each item. blah
[01:56:51] <xec> maybe you would be better off with a mvvm framework. what are you working on?
[01:57:01] <_genuser_> mvvm?
[01:57:10] <xKraty> model view view-model
[01:57:10] <xec> model/view/viewmodel
[01:57:28] <_genuser_> hmmm further bastardization of mvc?
[01:57:44] * _genuser_ makes note to read up on mvvm.
[01:57:51] <xec> you could call it that :)
[01:58:07] <_genuser_> xec: just need a reference to figure out what it is. will have to googel it.
[01:58:11] <_genuser_> *needed
[01:58:33] <_genuser_> what I'm tryign to do is ping servers and retrieve from them stats and then display them in a page.
[01:58:46] <_genuser_> however, if the server info is incorrect or it is off, the socket timeout takes a long time.
[01:59:00] <xKraty> maybe you just need something like handlebars
[01:59:03] <_genuser_> in addition the php script times out after 30 seconds.
[01:59:09] <_genuser_> xKraty: the moustache?
[01:59:27] <xKraty> yeah
[01:59:32] <xec> lol
[01:59:33] <_genuser_> so if the scripts times out after 30 second not only does it cut off after showing a couple of servers, but all teh page end jquery never gets written.
[01:59:42] <xec> i think he meant literal mustache
[01:59:53] <xec> as opposed to mustache.js :P
[02:00:13] <_genuser_> :-{o
[02:00:22] <_genuser_> xKraty: so what's this handlebar?
[02:00:32] <xec> templating for js
[02:01:06] <xec> http://handlebarsjs.com/
[02:01:06] <xKraty> yeah, from my point so usefull when you shitload of html manipulation
[02:01:07] <xKraty> http://handlebarsjs.com/
[02:01:14] <_genuser_> xec: my solution was to write out individual divs for each server. and then separately write a status div.
[02:01:51] <_genuser_> then client-side jquery script will .each() the server divs, get their ip and run teh query script. then parse it and dynammically add new clones of the "status div" for each server.
[02:01:53] <xKraty> _genuser_: anyway if your script timeout you might need something else
[02:02:37] <_genuser_> xKraty: well, once the page is served up by server side, it's done. then client-sde launches new requests to the server and populates the data. However, the page isn't sitting incomplete this whole time.
[02:02:50] <Anticom> Hi all
[02:03:08] <xKraty> hello Anticom
[02:03:34] <Anticom> I'm trying to come up with a intuitive UI for managing modules in a report. I've got a set of available modules and want a possibility to add modules to a report and also order them
[02:03:35] <xKraty> _genuser_: yeah but the timeout still a problem on ajax requests
[02:03:48] <Anticom> I've tried two dnd's but the code is an absolute mess :/
[02:04:01] <Anticom> do you know any plugins providing such feature?
[02:04:10] <xKraty> jquery ui
[02:04:21] <xKraty> drag&drop, sortable etc
[02:04:31] <_genuser_> xKraty: it is. however since the page is rendered all the jquery is written out and the user is able to see however much is rendered.
[02:04:53] <_genuser_> xKraty: it also allows the user to navigate away or to click on something else and just leave the page.
[02:05:06] <_genuser_> ok, this handlebar looks like it is what I'd like to use.
[02:05:18] <_genuser_> however, it's pissing me off that there's so many tons of frameworks out there.
[02:05:27] <xec> yeah I know the feeling
[02:05:34] <_genuser_> can't people just finish their projects and not turn it into a framework that people then have to learn!!?
[02:05:42] <xKraty> if i got your point handlebars should be the way
[02:05:55] <_genuser_> xKraty: from teh main page of it, it looks like the thing.
[02:06:03] <xKraty> it's logicless template
[02:06:12] <_genuser_> xKraty: basically template UI elements and use with jquery to deliver dynamic ocntent.
[02:06:35] <_genuser_> it's the {{ }} and the .register(somethig new) that pisses me off.
[02:06:46] <_genuser_> because of having to learn it, lol.
[02:07:07] <_genuser_> still getting used to $(obj).xx_methods().
[02:07:21] <xKraty> i like the {{ }} and i did put the .register dinamically
[02:07:36] <xKraty> y*
[02:07:44] <_genuser_> var html    = template(context);
[02:07:49] <_genuser_> dang, that's powerful.
[02:08:02] <xKraty> lol
[02:08:04] <_genuser_> create teh frickin' template and it will then be useable in one fell swoop.
[02:08:22] <xKraty> you still can make a new framework ahah
[02:08:29] <_genuser_> I'm liking it. this is probably the way I should take it.
[02:08:50] <xKraty> i grouped all handlebars in an object $hb
[02:09:04] <xKraty> and preload all the templates needed on that page
[02:09:12] <_genuser_> xKraty: I actually started an asynchronous events delivery framework for html pages. before the nodejs apps (i know that's not it's main purpose) and before all the other crap.
[02:09:39] <_genuser_> it was successfully delivering async message to IE, FF, chrome, safari. two users could chat using async events, etc.
[02:09:55] <_genuser_> then once the mental curiosity of "how should it be done" was finished, couldn't finish it.
[02:10:02] <xKraty> lol
[02:10:13] <Cork> _genuser_: you might want to look into websocket
[02:10:23] <Cork> it is very nice for chat implementations
[02:10:30] <xKraty> like faye
[02:10:49] <xKraty> http://faye.jcoglan.com/
[02:10:50] <_genuser_> for me, I have to have a need for it in a project  then I'll finish it. if I use the application for a need, then I'll finish it no matter how boring/challenging.
[02:11:14] <_genuser_> Cork: yep, now we have all that. this was way back when websockets weren't more than a dream.
[02:11:38] <Cork> _genuser_: and webrtc is on the way :)
[02:11:52] <_genuser_> Cork: not familiar with it.
[02:12:06] <Cork> _genuser_: client to client protocol
[02:12:13] <_genuser_> oooh nice.
[02:12:13] <Cork> meaning no need to proxy it over the server
[02:12:16] <_genuser_> just saw the main page of it.
[02:12:32] <_genuser_> further pissery.
[02:12:42] <_genuser_> kinda pissed me off that ppl keep creating dang frameworks.
[02:12:54] <_genuser_> can never sit back for a minute. need to keep learning new crap, lol.
[02:12:57] <xKraty> i always say that i should have open a bakery
[02:13:08] <Cork> lol
[02:13:10] <Cork> bakery?
[02:13:22] <xKraty> i like bread!
[02:13:35] <xKraty> well i totally love it
[02:13:37] <Cork> heh, ya baking is fun
[02:13:56] <xKraty> i didn't study that much at school time
[02:13:56] <Cork> not sure i would like it as a job though
[02:14:04] <Cork> kinda lousy work hours
[02:14:09] <_genuser_> I think of walking away from tech profession.
[02:14:10] <xec> but you can't beat the smell of an office filled with sweaty nerds
[02:14:21] <Cork> lol
[02:14:23] <_genuser_> I love comptuers and all. and tech stuff. just that it has a high burnout factor.
[02:14:23] <xKraty> Cork: i d be the boss chilling at home not waking at 4 lol
[02:14:25] * xec takes a deep breath
[02:14:32] <_genuser_> xec: lol
[02:14:46] <Cork> xec: for a second i thought you mean the bakery
[02:14:51] <xec> heheheh
[02:14:54] <xKraty> lol
[02:14:54] <Cork> then i... XD
[02:15:36] <xec> i guess bakeries have their nerds too
[02:15:37] <_genuser_> {{#list people}}{{firstName}} {{lastName}}{{/list}}
[02:15:47] <_genuser_> that's enough to drive anyone on a murderous rampage
[02:16:08] <xec> yeah it needs more curly brackets
[02:16:29] <xec> you can never have enough curly brackets
[02:16:30] <_genuser_> if I have a framework, I'm putting all the crap for it inside the following tags.
[02:16:45] <_genuser_> {[<!!~  ~!!>]}
[02:16:53] <xKraty> lol
[02:16:53] <_genuser_> let's see you beat that nerds!!
[02:16:59] <_genuser_> lol
[02:17:16] <xKraty> i used something like that for pdf placeholders
[02:17:21] <xec> it needs more curly brackets
[02:17:21] <_genuser_> if it's not a visually schizophrenic experience, it's not a fashionable framework.
[02:18:02] <_genuser_> submitting for review {{[[{{<!!~  ~!!>}}]]}}
[02:18:45] <{[{> bleah
[02:18:54] <{[{> i cant set it as name lol
[02:18:58] <xec> lol
[02:19:03] <xec> syntax error
[02:19:06] <_genuser_> lol.
[02:19:11] <_genuser_> you tried to steal my framework?
[02:19:27] <xKraty> no i d have added to the end by _genuser_
[02:19:31] <Cork> xKraty: ya !, ~ and space is reserved
[02:19:56] <xKraty> do _genuser_ stand for generic user lol
[02:20:03] <_genuser_> gentoo user.
[02:20:10] <_genuser_> genuser was taken so I added _'s.
[02:20:36] <xKraty> lol
[02:20:44] <_genuser_> back in 05 or something i was instlaling it for the first time, and I'd join the channel looking for help.
[02:20:46] <xec> speaking of a visually schizophrenic experience, do you recall what codes were needed for backwards compatible inline script in xhtml was?
[02:21:05] <_genuser_> and I just picked genuser as a name but then couldn't register it and had built enough acquaintanceships with the nick.
[02:21:07] <xec> <script type="text/javascript"><!--//--><![CDATA[//><!--
[02:21:13] <xec> //--><!]]></script>
[02:21:15] <Uhkis> +1 for gentoo :-)
[02:21:19] <xKraty> cdata was awesome
[02:21:28] <_genuser_> oh that CDATA crap is annoying.
[02:21:33] <_genuser_> Uhkis: :)
[02:21:46] <_genuser_> my server still runs gentoo. raid1 + samba.
[02:21:59] <Uhkis> this work desktop and my home htpc run gentoo
[02:22:10] <xKraty> all the time i hear samba i image some brazillian girls dancing lol
[02:22:18] <_genuser_> used gentoo for my laptop for a while. but now desktop is win7.
[02:22:24] <_genuser_> xKraty: yeah that works too.
[02:22:25] <xKraty> on the server sambaaaaa
[02:22:30] <xec> +1 for brazilian girls dancing
[02:22:36] <_genuser_> +2 for them
[02:22:41] <xKraty> lol
[02:23:20] <xKraty_with> i hate irc :|
[02:25:25] <_genuser_> xec: lol they beat us to it.     handlebar.com says:     Template comments with {{! }} or {{!-- --}}.
[02:26:08] <Mothership> Hello
[02:26:08] <xKraty> well nobody is perfect lol
[02:26:19] <oliwe> http://kennedyandoswald.com/#!/premiere-screen
[02:26:21] <oliwe> godammit
[02:26:23] <oliwe> why is this so good
[02:26:29] <oliwe> much jelly
[02:27:24] <Mothership> I have multiple elements who have two classes which one of them is the same for all of them, problem is when i try to change attribute by the class that is different, it does it for all the elements
[02:27:41] <Mothership> Help would be appreciated
[02:28:05] <xKraty> what you want to change Mothership?
[02:28:22] <xec> Mothership: can you show us your code? (preferabbly in a running environment)
[02:28:26] <Mothership> i want to change text()
[02:28:41] <Mothership> yes h/o
[02:28:41] <xKraty> of which one?
[02:28:46] <xec> s/bb/b
[02:28:48] <Mothership> i just give a link
[02:31:00] <Mothership> http://pastie.org/8833053
[02:31:17] <Mothership> it changes the text for both
[02:32:27] <xKraty> it do work
[02:32:27] <xKraty> http://jsbin.com/toputuwo/1/
[02:33:18] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/QZ5S6/
[02:33:36] <xec> because i just got a blank page at xKraty's link :P
[02:33:46] <xKraty> whaaat?
[02:34:07] <xKraty> http://jsbin.com/toputuwo/1/edit pff
[02:34:34] <xKraty> xec: you just annoyed that this time i've been faster than you lol
[02:34:53] <xec> i actually did get a blank page, but revisiting the first link now it works
[02:35:23] <xKraty> maybe you opened while i was adding the .ready that i forgot :p
[02:35:25] <Mothership> uh gonna keep on debugging lol
[02:35:28] <xec> Mothership: in any case, xKraty is right, the code works as intended, only the first div is changed
[02:36:04] <Mothership> Yes i stripped the code a bit and ive noticed that it works when its simplefied like this..
[02:36:12] <Mothership> gotta debug some more :c
[02:36:41] <xKraty> Mothership: if all get edit you surely have a wrong selector
[02:37:09] <xKraty> if it's dynamic selector it happen to remove all html page like i did lol
[02:37:37] <xKraty> i should create a #best-bug-ever
[02:40:15] <Mothership> Ok guys I got it, I was recieving the classnames from db in json format, and one of the classnames was the first one, so it automatically change the text of all of the elements...
[02:40:53] <xKraty> another problem solved!
[02:42:44] * Mothership puts on the sunglasses
[02:43:28] * xKraty open the umbrella
[02:55:00] <mepl> Hello, when I append html to a div. I do not wish to add a scrollbar-x but I want it to increase in height. THis is my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/5Zmct/5/
[02:55:03] <mepl> so you know what I mean
[02:55:14] <mepl> Any ideas?
[02:55:41] <xec> mepl: http://jsfiddle.net/5Zmct/6/
[02:55:54] <xec> &nbsp; is specifically *non-breaking* space
[02:57:49] <mepl> xec: what did you do?
[02:57:59] <xec> added a space after the </span>
[02:58:27] <mepl> lol
[02:59:00] <jlebrech> does anyone know a plugin to create an overlay when you drag a file over the page
[02:59:33] <xec> mepl: also, if you want vertical margin you can use inline-block http://jsfiddle.net/5Zmct/7/
[03:01:10] <mepl> xec: I did that. the spacing between each row is to small though.
[03:01:12] <mepl> can I increase it?
[03:01:40] <xec> did you see the last update at /7 ?
[03:01:53] <xec> just use a bigger margin
[03:02:33] <Mothership> can anyone explain why it text() in both situations moves the paragraph outside the dom?
[03:02:37] <Mothership> http://jsfiddle.net/4tmpN/
[03:03:10] <xec> Mothership: .text() overwrites the content (removing the <p>)
[03:03:20] <xec> Mothership: if you want to put the text in the <p>, select that instead
[03:03:29] <xec> Mothership: http://jsfiddle.net/4tmpN/1/
[03:04:00] <xec> also, you can't nest paragraphs
[03:04:01] <Mothership> the problem is that not always its gonna be p
[03:04:06] <Mothership> it can be any other element too
[03:04:29] <xKraty> http://jsfiddle.net/4tmpN/2/
[03:04:41] <xKraty> if it's only one element you can use *
[03:04:50] <xec> hehe
[03:05:01] <xec> that will also select any other nested element though
[03:05:11] <Mothership> yeah, thanks xKraty thats what is was looking for!
[03:05:13] <xKraty> http://jsfiddle.net/4tmpN/3/
[03:05:23] <Mothership> omg cant type today
[03:05:35] <xec> the * is implied
[03:05:38] <xKraty> you can select only first subset of elements and the first one so you make xec happy aswell lol
[03:06:13] <Mothership> that can be handy too
[03:06:22] <xKraty> $('.lol > *').text('othertext');
[03:06:25] <xec> ".lol > :first-child"
[03:06:27] <xKraty> $('.lol > :first').text('othertext');
[03:06:35] <xKraty> you can play with it
[03:06:57] <xec> .text("") will do an implicit .first() though
[03:07:14] <xec> which is why ".lol *" would also *work*
[03:07:41] <xec> no nevermind
[03:07:52] <xec> it will set the text of all matched elements
[03:07:53] <Mothership> * scares me, because I get the impression that it somehow is slower than being more specific
[03:08:16] <xec> yeah not only slower but it might select a lot more than you really want
[03:08:23] <Mothership> exactly
[03:08:52] <Cork> xec: actually .text("") doesn't do an implicit .first()
[03:08:55] <Cork> only getting goes
[03:09:03] <Cork> meaning .text() does
[03:09:16] <Cork> goes==does
[03:09:43] <Mothership> '.lol > *:first' in this example, doesn't he first do * and only then does :first? wouldn't that be extra work?
[03:10:14] <Mothership> but I understand how that would be better in order to avoid some trouble in future
[03:11:48] <xec> Cork: yeah, i noticed, hence the added notes ;)
[03:12:04] <Cork> opps
[03:12:07] <Cork> sorry missed that
[03:15:58] <Mothership> '.lol > *:first
[03:16:13] <Mothership> how to make it so the *:first is optional?
[03:16:40] <Cork> optional?
[03:16:49] <Mothership> there could and there couldnt be an element inside dom
[03:17:01] <Mothership> so if there isnt, then apply to the parent dom
[03:17:17] <Cork> $('.lol, .lol > *:first').last
[03:17:19] <Cork> *$('.lol, .lol > *:first').last()
[03:18:28] <Cork> only works if you only have more then one .lol though
[03:18:32] <Cork> uh
[03:18:37] <Cork> * if you don't have more then
[03:20:19] <^^cjg^^> Good morning. I am trying to use AND logical selectors, to compare different terms, but it is only checking the first term: if ($('#term1').is(':not(:checked)') && $('#term2').is(':not(:checked)')){  //Operations }
[03:20:32] <^^cjg^^> Am I using the AND operator, properly?
[03:21:30] <Cork> $('#term1, #term2').not(':checked').length < 2
[03:22:09] <Cork> ^^cjg^^: though yes you code should work too
[03:22:36] <^^cjg^^> thanks Cork
[03:22:44] <^^cjg^^> I'm going to try with your solution :)
[03:23:25] <Cork> *your code
[03:30:29] <glontu> hi
[03:31:05] <glontu> i have an object with an initStore method and i want to allow so that if the user passes a callback named onDataLoaded, then my store should be able to call me.onDataLoaded()
[03:31:20] <glontu> how can i add this function in the object's own initStore method ?
[03:31:39] <Cork> callback named?
[03:31:49] <glontu> onDataLoaded
[03:31:56] <Cork> i meant what do you mean named
[03:32:07] <Cork> you can name the variable holding the callback
[03:32:18] <Cork> but not what they want to call it
[03:32:27] <glontu> i mean i want my object to have an empty function for this callback initially and the user be able to override it with actual function
[03:32:43] <Cork> this.onDataLoaded = $.noop;
[03:32:52] <Cork> and then let the caller set that variable
[03:33:00] <glontu> ok, thanks
[03:33:03] <Cork> or you could use the $.Callbacks if you want to allow chaining
[03:33:06] <xec> i love how that reads "Snoop"
[03:33:15] <Cork> :)
[03:42:44] <Anticom> lol why doesn't the parentsUntil() not work here? :O http://jsbin.com/gozutove/4/
[03:43:26] <slax0r> Anticom: $this ...
[03:43:35] <Anticom> ?
[03:43:40] <slax0r> oh, missed var $this
[03:43:45] <slax0r> sry
[03:44:01] <Anticom> welcome ;p
[03:45:37] <xec> Anticom: did you want .closest() ?
[03:45:40] <Anticom> oh i see. .parentsUntil does NOT include the selected element itself
[03:45:41] <slax0r> Anticom: I'd say that because you have parentsUntil li, and li is the only parent you have
[03:45:45] <slax0r> and doesn't get selected
[03:46:09] <Anticom> a simple .parent() does the trick
[03:46:12] <Anticom> jeez
[03:46:15] <slax0r> parents until ul would do it too
[03:46:19] <Anticom> yea
[03:46:21] <Anticom> true
[03:46:34] <slax0r> but since its only one, parent should be the best bet
[03:47:00] <Anticom> slax0r but parentsUntil('ul') gives me more flexibility regarding the markup
[03:47:02] <krambiorix> hi, i have a dialog in another dialog, but the overlay doesn't mask the outer dialog... How can i do that?
[03:47:11] <Anticom> might save me debugging, when i change the template
[03:47:22] <slax0r> Anticom: true, it would select the li even if you would place a wrapper div in the li i.e.
[03:47:24] <Anticom> and who cares about performance on a single click event :D
[03:47:28] <xec> `api closest @ Anticom
[03:47:28] <b-ot> Anticom: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[03:47:58] <Anticom> xec so is that the only difference to .parentsUntil() ?
[03:48:40] <xec> Anticom: i'm not sure what you mean. .closest("li") gets the closest ancestor <li>
[03:49:09] <Anticom> well, since the UL can just contain LI's it doesn't matter which one i use i guess
[03:49:18] <Anticom> it's just a matter of choosing the right selector then
[03:49:44] <xec> Anticom: .parentsUntil() gets a collection of all the ancestors *until* something is matched
[03:50:11] <slax0r> closest gets you only that one that it finds
[03:50:15] <slax0r> the first one*
[03:50:23] <xec> the closest*
[03:50:25] <Anticom> xec oh i see
[03:50:49] <Anticom> lol, firefox just died ._.
[03:50:53] <slax0r> xec: which in turn is the first parent that matches that selector
[03:51:11] <slax0r> http://fc06.deviantart.net/fs16/f/2007/197/4/5/Firefox_has_crashed_by_Captain_Nintendork.jpg
[03:51:11] <xec> slax0r: "first" imploes sibling relationship (as in :first)
[03:51:19] <Anticom> http://fixitwizkid.com/attachments/xaeam-jpg.3217/ :(
[03:51:20] <xec> implies*
[03:51:41] <slax0r> yeah, get your head out of code language for a bit :P
[03:51:42] <xec> lol, love the images
[03:51:43] <Anticom> haha that's a good one too slax0r :D
[03:54:54] <Anticom> how does that delegate thing work again? The delete handler doesn't seem to work for dynamically inserted elements :/ http://jsbin.com/gozutove/6
[03:55:46] <xec> $(".staticParent").on("click", ".dynamicChild", func)
[03:57:49] <xec> Anticom: http://jsbin.com/gozutove/7/
[03:58:19] <Anticom> cheers xec :)

[05:41:48] <ankurk_>  ecky--ptang-zoob: may be use ".filter()" function?
[05:42:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok i'll have a look
[05:42:43] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: $('.class-names:visible').length != 1
[05:43:30] <Cork> or ya filter if you already have a selection of elements
[05:43:53] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: but do you want "at least one" or "exactly one"?
[05:44:07] <Cork> if you want at least you can use .is(':visible')
[05:44:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> at least 1
[05:44:37] <Cork> is then
[05:44:47] <Cork> selection.is(':visible')
[05:45:09] <Cork> will give you true if any of the elements is not display: none;
[05:45:56] <Cork> personally i prefer to use a class for hiding
[05:46:06] <Cork> makes it easier to make styling and selecting them
[05:46:19] <ankurk_> is it possible to clear a select box individually without any button?
[05:46:46] <Cork> ankurk_: depends on what you mean by clear
[05:47:51] <hellothere> hey there any ideas on WYMeditor?
[05:48:13] <Cork> wym?
[05:48:14] <ankurk_> Cork: well I have a lot of select boxes that filter out a table, I do have a button that clear out the boxes but I want to clear each one of them individually.
[05:48:31] <hellothere> ye its  like wysiwg but its for markdown
[05:48:33] <hellothere> only*
[05:48:36] <Cork> ankurk_: ok based on what?
[05:48:38] <Cork> ah
[05:48:53] <xec> hellothere: is that the entire question?
[05:49:00] <Cork> hellothere: so basically a toolbar with things to inject into the editor?
[05:49:08] <ankurk_> Cork: what do you mean?
[05:49:24] <Cork> ankurk_: what should clear them individually?
[05:49:40] <hellothere> yes, i want actually an editor that is converting text to markdown client side
[05:49:50] <Cork> ankurk_: and again what do you mean by clear
[05:50:05] <Cork> ankurk_: are you clearing it with a form reset right now or what?
[05:50:14] <ankurk_> Like suppose if I select the default option, it should clear the results and user should be able to start again
[05:50:45] <ankurk_> I am clearing like this, https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/13f092bacb4f3860ac63
[05:51:19] <Cork> ankurk_: ok so pure js
[05:51:31] <ankurk_> means?
[05:51:46] <Cork> ankurk_: just that you arn't using the form reset feature
[05:51:58] <ankurk_> yep I am not using that since there's no form
[05:52:18] <Cork> anyway so you want to reset the other select elements when the first one is changed?
[05:52:20] <Cork> or what?
[05:52:41] <Cork> ankurk_: you basically should ALWAYS have a form around form elements
[05:52:49] <Cork> even if it isn't submitting things
[05:53:11] <ankurk_> well I just reset one without any button
[05:53:15] <ankurk_> *want to
[05:53:28] <ankurk_> I do have a button to clear all of them at once
[05:53:30] <Cork> ankurk_: well sure what you want to do is clear
[05:53:31] <Cork> but not when
[05:53:50] <Cork> random time intervals?
[05:53:55] <ankurk_> nope
[05:53:57] <Cork> based on the boon?
[05:53:59] <Cork> moon?
[05:54:02] <Cork> :)
[05:54:17] <ankurk_> I might be missing something, let me ask my supervisor
[05:54:18] <Cork> basically you need to explain when you want the reset to happen
[05:54:40] <sunbeam> if string contains "_picture_this"
[05:54:40] <sunbeam> how can i test this with javascript
[05:55:01] <Cork> sunbeam: indexOf for the simplest forms
[05:55:41] <Cork> js> print("you_can_picture_this_can't_you?".indexOf("picture_this") != -1)
[05:55:47] <ankurk_> I got it Cork, actually I have a live filter with filters table using keywords
[05:55:48] <b-ot> Cork: true
[05:55:53] <sunbeam> Thanks
[05:55:55] <ankurk_> and then there are select filters
[05:56:25] <ankurk_> I want to reset one individual filter when user applies a wrong select filter
[05:56:40] <Cork> oook...?
[05:56:43] <Cork> and when is that?
[05:57:50] <ankurk_> Suppose for example user filtered a table with keyword "Some", he wants to apply a On Air filter but instead he applied priority filter
[05:58:09] <ankurk_> at that time he should be able to reset the On Air filter
[05:58:43] <Cork> ok so what user action would that be?
[05:59:23] <ankurk_> he should be able to clear the on air filter only
[05:59:48] <Cork> ok? so you want to add another button for clearing that or what?
[06:00:06] <Cork> ankurk_: you still haven't explained when; just at what intent
[06:00:30] <ankurk_> well, when he applies a wrong filter
[06:00:39] <Cork> ...
[06:00:52] <ankurk_> Let's have a use case shall we?
[06:00:53] <seutje> can't he just click the filter again and toggle it?
[06:01:10] <Cork> ankurk_: you just gave the use case
[06:01:22] <ankurk_> yeah that's the one
[06:01:23] <Cork> but not how you want to solve it
[06:01:29] <seutje> yes, let's! (I have no clue what that means)
[06:01:43] <ankurk_> I want to solve it without using any button
[06:01:54] <Cork> @_@'''
[06:01:55] <ankurk_> if that's possible
[06:02:19] <ankurk_> since I don't want the user to start from scratch again
[06:02:35] <Cork> $('magic-random-selector').on('something-went-wrong', function() { $('#something').reset() }) should do it...
[06:02:43] <Cork> seriously...
[06:02:45] <ankurk_> the clear button clears all the filters
[06:02:53] <Cork> you need to explain when you want it to happen
[06:03:32] <ankurk_> I just explained, when he selects the wrong filter, he should be able to clear that wrong filter only
[06:03:56] <Cork> ankurk_: and by "when" i mean "when element <element id"> is changed to another value then <x>" for example
[06:04:12] <seutje> how does he select the filters?
[06:04:14] <Cork> just to grab a random example
[06:04:19] <Cork> no clude
[06:04:19] <seutje> just make it a toggle?
[06:04:32] <seutje> you missed? click the shit again!
[06:04:55] <xKraty> lol ankurk_ don't make Cork mad
[06:05:07] <Cork> xKraty: far from mad
[06:05:12] <Cork> just slightly frustrated
[06:05:17] <seutje> he'll "screw" with you :D
[06:05:22] * xKraty slap ankurk_
[06:05:25] <seutje> I'm sorry :(
[06:05:40] <ankurk_> sorry I don't want to make Cork mad, here's a jsbin, http://jsbin.com/fifeqite/2/edit
[06:05:59] <xKraty> gosh that table again
[06:06:04] <ankurk_> Damn my supervisor
[06:06:15] <seutje> ankurk_: simple, make the 0 option an actual option
[06:06:40] <ankurk_> I think I am gonna do that
[06:06:40] <xKraty> meh, i have shitloads things todo! good luck ankurk_!
[06:06:41] <seutje> like... don't disable it
[06:06:47] <ankurk_> yeah
[06:06:58] <ankurk_> xKraty thanks man!
[06:08:24] <ankurk_> I apologize to Cork if he is really frustrated with me
[06:08:52] <Cork> ankurk_: no need, but you really should learn how to ask effective questions
[06:09:00] <ankurk_> I suck at that
[06:09:05] <Cork> ya
[06:09:19] <ankurk_> I would blame it on my vocabulary or limited knowledge
[06:09:48] <seutje> every time you repeat a selector, a kitten dies :(
[06:09:56] <Cork> ankurk_: what is still lacking in your descriptions is the ACTION you want to catch from the user
[06:10:05] <Cork> heh
[06:11:24] <ankurk_> hmm
[06:18:34] <ankurk_> I think I finally got what I wanted, phew
[06:19:06] <ankurk_> Just did this, https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/6ffda93f845267560793
[06:20:43] <ankurk_> on a side note, is there any good article on refactoring jQuery you can recommend?
[06:21:13] <ankurk_> though I know some things like caching repeating varibales
[06:21:17] <ankurk_> *variables
[06:39:11] <mepl> Hi, I get cookie is undefined in this code http://jsfiddle.net/L7HGW/ var cookieArr = cookie.split(',');
[06:39:21] <mepl> what could be wrong? It worked yesterday now suddenly it doesnt.
[06:40:00] <dismist> looks like jquery hasnt loaded yet
[06:40:18] <dismist> oh
[06:40:24] <dismist> var cookie 		= ('billForm');
[06:40:32] <dismist> should probably be var cookie 		= $('billForm');
[06:40:43] <mepl> should it?
[06:40:58] <dismist> try it, pansy
[06:41:42] <mepl> https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[06:41:45] <mepl> am just following this
[06:41:49] <mepl> I cant use the split on that one
[06:42:27] <dismist> how are u going to define it as 'billForm' then attempt to explode it into an array by chopping it at every comma when there are no commas
[06:43:00] <mepl> i set the cookie with php
[06:43:03] <dismist> depending on what 'billForm' is
[06:43:13] <mepl> the $.cookie reads the cookie
[06:43:29] <dismist> where is there a $.cookie in this code?
[06:43:43] <mepl> var cookie 		= $.cookie('billForm');
[06:44:14] <sunbeam> i have a string that at some place contains _of_12 - how can i remove every text that comes after this?
[06:44:20] <dismist> ok it said var cookie = ('billForm') just a second ago
[06:44:40] <dismist> check the billForm cookie with some kind of browser plugin and see if it contains any commas
[06:44:50] <mepl> I cant find billForm at all :p
[06:45:00] <dismist> well
[06:45:04] <dismist> perhaps your cookie isnt setting
[06:45:32] <mepl> offtopic but why shouldnt it? 			setcookie("billForm", $cookie, time()+3600);
[06:46:03] <dismist> $cookie???
[06:46:08] <mepl> it is set
[06:46:10] <mepl> above
[06:46:19] <dismist> does it have any commas in it
[06:46:21] <mepl> yes
[06:46:25] <mepl> A, B, C
[06:46:27] <mepl> is the content
[06:46:43] <r-r-r> does anyone know if there is TRULY a method to disable jquery mobile's addition of it's own themes?
[06:46:53] <r-r-r> i mean disable it globally on load
[06:47:05] <dismist> console.log(cookie); after var cookie =
[06:47:12] <r-r-r> but KEEP it's ajax functionality. i have to keep jqm's mobile ajax navigation
[06:47:28] <krambiorix> does anyone use dropzonejs to upload files?? I add clickable:true  but the dropzone is not clickable
[06:47:37] <bigbugjava> Hi, Is it possible to prevent double click all over my site, I dont want people to be able to double click so pages wont freak out
[06:48:02] <mepl> undefined
[06:48:17] <dismist> $('body').on('dblclick',function() {
[06:48:30] <bigbugjava> dismist ?
[06:49:05] <dismist> $('body').on('dblclick',function(e) { e.preventDefault(); /* this may be deprecated */ return false; });
[06:49:57] <dismist> mepl: there's too many unknown variables here with the code u have pasted.  show me the live page
[06:53:13] <bigbugjava> dismist thx
[06:54:13] <bigbugjava> dismist actually, it doens't prevent the click
[06:54:31] <bigbugjava> or making double click on buttons run twice
[06:55:25] <dismist> u getting an error?
[06:55:59] <dismist> http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/639084/How-to-Avoid-Double-Clicking-With-jQuery
[06:56:24] <bigbugjava> dismist no mate, the functions runs 2 times.
[06:56:34] <bigbugjava> if I "mistakely" double click
[07:07:09] <bigbugjava> .one does the trick I think
[07:33:38] <Erryl> Someone knows a simple plugin that can handle citations?
[07:35:41] <ankurk_> Erryl: http://html5doctor.com/blockquote-q-cite/
[07:36:49] <Erryl> ankurk_ Hmm maybe citations wasn't a good word. I actually ment like references.
[07:37:11] <Erryl> ankurk_: So a superscript number in a text that leads to another website for instance
[07:37:52] <ankurk_> Do you have any live example? Like did you see it on a website?
[07:39:10] <ankurk_> Erryl: something like this? http://jacobheftmann.com/projects/footnoted/
[07:39:38] <Erryl> ankurk_: Yeah indeed something like htat
[07:39:57] <Erryl> ankurk_: https://code.google.com/p/jquerycitations/ is another example, it even i a plugin, but I can't really get it to work
[07:40:14] <ankurk_> May try one of the options here? http://www.unheap.com/?s=footnote
[07:42:23] <Erryl> ankurk_ : It is kinda odd to use though because each of my website pages fills the whole screen, you don't have to scroll
[07:44:16] <ankurk_> you don't want to scroll?
[07:44:53] <Erryl> ankurk_: I don't have to, everything fits on one page
[07:45:31] <krambiorix> hi, i want to autocomplete a postal code... But my country has 2270 postal codes... Won't that be very slow to load every time?
[07:45:33] <ankurk_> hmm, may be create a <div> for citation do link to it?
[07:46:28] <ankurk_> krambiorix: well, you will making an ajax call, and in the back it will only match the codes that match the text in the textbox
[07:48:01] <ankurk_> *backend
[07:48:28] <NoiseEee> krambiorix: yes, thats not a sensible solution
[07:48:37] <NoiseEee> krambiorix: nor particularly helpful UI
[07:48:41] <Erryl> ankurk_: I will see what elese I can do, thanks for the links by the way
[07:48:56] <ankurk_> Erryl: anytime!
[07:49:51] <farn5w0rth> if i have something like var test = $("#test") deep inside some javascript, how can i call the value of test from within my html?
[07:50:47] <krambiorix> ankurk_, yes, but those almost never change, so i thought adding it to the browser's cache
[07:51:43] <ankurk_> that doesn't matter, you won't be showing all the postal codes. Everytime someone types in it will make an ajax call
[07:52:30] <krambiorix> ankurk_, yes, but i want to make the ajax call one time per month or something
[07:52:41] <krambiorix> the autocomplete will filter it
[07:52:54] <bigbugjava> Hi, I wanted to insure, double click wont trigger me functions twice, the issue is that I used .one, so now I cant click on a link 2 times aswell
[07:53:42] <ankurk_> krambiorix: Something like this, might be helpful to you, http://developwithstyle.com/articles/2010/05/14/jquery-ui-autocomplete-is-it-any-good/
[07:54:35] <krambiorix> ankurk_, yes i'm aware of all that... Hmmm i think i'll need html 5
[07:55:08] <ankurk_> what you can do is make an ajax call when the page loads and cache all results
[07:55:40] <krambiorix> ankurk_, yes but when i refresh the page, the ajax has to load again
[07:55:47] <decx> i have to take a look at typeahead as a autocomplete alternative http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/
[07:56:25] <ankurk_> you can use localstorage
[07:56:37] <ankurk_> and store all the results as key-value pairs
[08:04:15] <krambiorix> ankurk_, yeah, thanks!
[08:04:31] <ankurk_> krambiorix: you're welcome!
[08:04:32] <lethjakman> hey, I have some jquery/jcrop code that looks like this: https://gist.github.com/lethjakman/9320136 but update is never called
[08:04:34] <lethjakman> any ideas?
[08:04:57] <ryanneufeld> lethjakman: you're using coffeescript. Which isn't supported here
[08:05:22] <ryanneufeld> lethjakman: Does the code work when you write it in plain js?
[08:05:36] <lethjakman> ryanneufeld: I fixed it so nevermind!
[08:05:41] <lethjakman> I must have been too tired last night
[08:05:43] <lethjakman> thank you anyways
[08:09:42] <Erryl> Hmm if I want people to fill in their own tag, how should I do this? http://jsfiddle.net/vF3mC/
[08:10:00] <Erryl> I mean, I can change the tag now, but how can I let other people do it via my webstie
[08:10:42] <decx> that'S some fancy css bro
[08:11:09] <lethjakman> lol...
[08:11:19] <Erryl> Oh lol
[08:11:21] <Erryl> Sorry xD
[08:11:40] <Erryl> http://jsfiddle.net/vF3mC/1/
[08:13:04] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/vF3mC/2/
[08:13:48] <Shilon> hello, I'm trying to add gridalicious to my website, everything is working except the fact that it still leaves blank spaces on bottom on the divs that have bigger heights than the ones next to it
[08:13:55] <Shilon> anyone knows why this happens?
[08:14:35] <Erryl> decx: Thanks!
[08:14:46] <decx> do you get it?
[08:15:13] <decx> var tag grabs the value of a specified element, and then we just call that in your json call
[08:15:30] <ankurk_> Finally got rid of the table xKraty! :D
[08:20:01] <Erryl> decx: For what you use the placeholder?
[08:20:17] <decx> that's a usability thing
[08:20:25] <decx> it'll show a placeholder in an input element
[08:20:37] <decx> it's good practice to add those
[08:20:47] <Erryl> decx: Aha I see
[08:22:57] <EminenceHC> How can I debug the parameters that a particular form submits?
[08:23:38] <decx> you can see postevents in your firebug/devtools
[08:25:40] <xKraty> ankurk_: gg
[08:27:40] <ankurk_> thanks for the help man!
[08:27:51] <ankurk_> you sure you still don't want a beer? :P
[08:28:26] <decx> finally done with the table?
[08:28:58] <decx> next assignment: debug our myspace page
[08:30:04] <ankurk_> who uses myspace nowadays? :O
[08:30:22] <decx> who doesn't use plugins nowadays?
[08:30:29] <decx> *burn*
[08:30:35] <ankurk_> :|
[08:30:44] <decx> :D
[08:30:45] <ankurk_> why everyone bullies me everytime :P
[08:31:10] <decx> banter isnt bullying :(
[08:31:50] <ankurk_> I think I used a wrong term :/
[08:32:36] <decx> i want to cook pasta but i don't have salt
[08:32:50] <ankurk_> So cook it without salt :P
[08:33:06] <decx> xKraty you're italian, is pasta without salt in the cooking water blasphemous?
[08:33:14] <kyllesdk> You tears contain salt. Just cry in it ;)
[08:33:35] <ankurk_> kyllesdk: science eh?
[08:33:35] <softplay> can anyone help with this issue? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22152035/cannot-refresh-value-in-a-form-inside-a-modal
[08:33:36] <xKraty> well my mom usually forgot or dont put much salt
[08:33:52] <kyllesdk> ankurk_: true that
[08:34:08] <xKraty> on opposite site my gf this summer almost killed me with like 1231231kg salt in the pasta :\
[08:34:08] <decx> i even got some bills laying around so those tears wont be aproblem
[08:34:42] <decx> ugh, oversalted pasta
[08:34:55] <ankurk_> xKraty: I thought, you were forever alone like me :P
[08:34:55] <decx> that's a killmove indeed
[08:34:55] <xKraty> if you got something like pesto it got enough salt
[08:35:08] <decx> i DO have pesto
[08:35:16] <xKraty> lol ankurk_, hard fight for that one
[08:35:20] <decx> pesto rosso
[08:35:31] <xKraty> it should be good w/o salt
[08:35:35] <webe> Hello, Is there a way to use jQuery UI to sort a grid of elements so that the vertical position retains its sort order rather than collapse it's vertical position? Swapping elements horizontally works just fine. It's the vertical swapping that acts funny. See this example - http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#display-grid
[08:35:45] <xKraty> i personally dont like much salt in it anyway, well i used like that lol
[08:36:05] <ankurk_> I sometimes eat too much salt or too much sweet
[08:36:40] <xKraty> chocolate is like drugs for me
[08:37:07] <decx> better than if drugs are like chocolate
[08:37:24] <ankurk_> I can eat anything with chocolate in it
[08:37:24] <xKraty> lol
[08:37:36] <xKraty> do you know nutella?
[08:39:24] <ankurk_> I hate nutella
[08:39:32] * xKraty slaps!
[08:40:06] <ankurk_> I never liked it's taste
[08:40:10] <decx> people outside of germany seem to love nutella, but the east german nudossi is much better
[08:41:26] <xKraty> i love nutella
[08:41:28] <decx> 36% hazelnuts vs 13% in nutella
[08:41:33] <xKraty> i live close to where nuts come from
[08:45:00] <Shilon> why can't I add percentage width to gridalicious?
[08:46:22] <Shilon> why can't I add percentage width to gridalicious?
[08:47:37] <decx> people can read Shilon but apparently nobody uses gridalicious
[08:48:39] <Shilon> decx: ok, thanks know any better grid system that uses percentages?
[08:49:04] <decx> gridalicious does use percentages form what i can tell from this page http://suprb.com/apps/gridalicious/
[08:49:41] <Shilon> decx: yes, but I have different grid sizes
[08:50:09] <Shilon> I have a grid with 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%
[08:51:00] <PatBateman> hi
[08:51:18] <Shilon> decx: the script is working, but I don't know why, when I add  $("#grid").gridalicious({ width: '100%', the script drops the boxes down and leave spaces
[08:51:42] <PatBateman> i try to add a row into a DataTables instance, and the it slide down, but the slide effect doesnt work
[08:51:45] <PatBateman> any idea why?
[08:51:46] <Shilon> decx: if I put a absolute width it works
[08:52:54] <decx> there's no option for multiple gridsize it seems
[08:53:25] <decx> if you want to check alternatives, they keyword for stuff like this is masonry or pinterest style
[08:53:41] <Shilon> yes, I made it with css I have a general class called box with classes for each sizes with the width of each
[08:54:23] <Shilon> decx: the boxes are all ok and the script works, but it cancels the relative positions :/
[09:07:17] <duch_kazatel> goooood morning #jquery
[09:07:26] <Mothership_> good morning !
[09:07:30] <Mothership_> evening that is
[09:07:38] <duch_kazatel> hah
[09:07:41] <duch_kazatel> europe?
[09:07:54] <Mothership> europe indeed
[09:08:06] <duch_kazatel> good times.  i've been to london, berlin, and prague.
[09:08:11] <duch_kazatel> awesome places.
[09:08:19] <Mothership> Oh reeheheheeeely
[09:08:35] <duch_kazatel> yeah. prauge was probably my favorite.
[09:08:37] <duch_kazatel> *prague
[09:08:39] <duch_kazatel> where are you at?
[09:08:44] <Mothership> Riga
[09:08:59] <duch_kazatel> oh wow, latvia?
[09:09:08] <Mothership> yes
[09:10:00] <duch_kazatel> very cool.
[09:10:46] <Mothership> Thank you, where are you from
[09:10:51] <duch_kazatel> california.
[09:10:55] <Mothership> Oh
[09:16:39] <fschuindt> Guys, I am declaring some js variables on the document, using <script> tag. Like var user_id = "#{@room.id}"; (the #{} is Ruby). But sometimes the js console says that user_id is not defined, even with it in the doc. Any tip?
[09:19:33] <duch_kazatel> fschuindt have a fiddle of thge rendered output?
[09:20:27] <fschuindt> duch_kazatel: fiddle?
[09:20:41] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:21:03] <fschuindt> duch_kazatel: oh, ok
[09:21:08] <hellothere> hey http://fiddle.jshell.net/dLTRZ/ on that thing anyone has any idea how am i able to do a foreach that converts as many id's titles and descriptions i have to accorditions?
[09:24:10] <duch_kazatel> hellothere which accordion are you using?  because I think you can just target a class to set those up.
[09:24:32] <hellothere> bootstrap
[09:24:34] <hellothere> v 2
[09:25:12] <fschuindt> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/9QZEC/
[09:25:37] <duch_kazatel> hellothere yeah you can just target a classname http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse
[09:25:56] <fschuindt> The problem is that sometimes the JS don't load the messages from server, but if I refresh the page it loads, it's really about sometimes, lol
[09:26:26] <duch_kazatel> fschuindt fist of all, you only need one document ready - put everything in one.
[09:26:37] <hellothere> duch_kazatel: what exactly u mean by that?
[09:26:40] <fschuindt> duch_kazatel: right
[09:26:46] <hellothere> atm on my fiddle i am feediing data through my api
[09:27:30] <duch_kazatel> hellothere ... okay?  you have to push that stuff out somewhere and then init it.,
[09:27:38] <duch_kazatel> fschuindt that's about all you should need to do.
[09:28:19] <hellothere> ye but thats why i was asking for an example or something
[09:29:07] <duch_kazatel> $('.classname').collapse();
[09:29:27] <duch_kazatel> or use the data attributes.
[09:57:01] <decx> mmmmh peking soup
[10:15:02] <Carty> I have a question regarding menus and timeouts
[10:15:10] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ carty
[10:15:10] <b-ot> carty: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:16:11] <Carty> so I have a menu and when you hover the menu appears, then when you mouse out it disappears, which is great. I just wondered if there was a way of setting a timer so that when I moused out I had, say a second, to move my mouse back in and keep the menu open
[10:16:33] <duch_kazatel> Carty sure - you'll have to setup a global timer for it.
[10:16:38] <duch_kazatel> and clear that timer on mouseenter.
[10:16:46] <Carty> my issue is how...
[10:16:50] <duch_kazatel> there's a javascript function called setTimeout().
[10:16:58] <Carty> I have limited knowledge of JS and Jquery
[10:17:03] <duch_kazatel> !mdn settimeout
[10:17:04] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: window.setTimeout - Mozilla Developer Network  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.setTimeout
[10:17:06] <Carty> and how does one use setTimeout()?
[10:17:20] <decx> it's better ux to have the menu disappear if you click outside the menu
[10:17:25] <duch_kazatel> just linked you the docs.
[10:17:34] <duch_kazatel> window.setTimeout(code, delay);
[10:17:42] <duch_kazatel> but that UX is generally fronwed upon.
[10:17:50] <duch_kazatel> if the user moused out, they had intent.
[10:17:58] <Carty> so how does I set up a "click outside the menu to close it"
[10:18:05] <Carty> sorry for my lack of knowledge
[10:18:17] <duch_kazatel> decx only if a click activated the menu, imo.
[10:18:42] <duch_kazatel> Carty if the user's mouse left the menu, that's good enough reason to close it.  what kind of menu is this?
[10:19:16] <Carty> hang on, let me upload it
[10:19:42] <decx> hm true, duch. my anti-hover mindset didnt even take that into regard ^^
[10:19:56] <dan2k3k4> anyone using bxSlider ?
[10:19:58] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:20:02] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ dan2k3k4
[10:20:02] <b-ot> dan2k3k4: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:20:28] <Carty> what does "!ask" do (unrelated I know :P)
[10:20:31] <dan2k3k4> I have a weird top and bottom spacing
[10:20:49] <duch_kazatel> Carty did you see what b-ot said?
[10:21:08] <hesco> I need the value of a selector for a subsequent ajax call.  I have tried: var state = $("#state option:selected"); and var state = $("#state option:selected").val; but neither seem to help.  How would I grab that value, please?
[10:21:13] <Carty> so you tell the bot to answer that guy?
[10:21:15] <dan2k3k4> only thing I found related was: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18601896/bxslider-unwanted-top-bottom-white-space - but already added those lines to the CSS file :/
[10:21:29] <duch_kazatel> b-ot is a copy of ecmabot.  the command !ask tells people to ask their question instead of telling people to ask outright all the time.
[10:21:30] <Carty> also, this: http://www.wulfrunconsulting.com/railbroker/index.html  the menu on the left (this website is in development, if you can't tell)
[10:21:50] <dan2k3k4> Carty, they're pre-set messages, there's lots of IRC channels with similar settings... like for !paste (or `paste )
[10:21:52] <duch_kazatel> hesco a jsfiddle would be helpful in your case.
[10:21:52] <dan2k3k4> !paste
[10:21:52] <b-ot> dan2k3k4: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:22:05] <decx> slide down on hover :o
[10:22:08] <duch_kazatel> dan2k3k4 do you have a jsfiddle example?
[10:22:21] <dan2k3k4> duch_kazatel, not yet, working on one
[10:22:24] <Carty> decx: I said I lacked knowledge :P
[10:22:27] <decx> Carty beware that makes people nauseous
[10:22:37] <duch_kazatel> Carty wooooah that's... not going to work very well.
[10:22:43] <duch_kazatel> Carty i'd rething your UX.
[10:22:47] <duch_kazatel> *rethink
[10:23:08] <Carty> this is why IRC is a good thing
[10:23:18] <decx> if you want your toplinks to be clickable i'd suggest an arrow on the right hand of those buttons to slide down the submenu
[10:23:22] <Carty> people can correct my terrible JS knowledge (or lack of it!)
[10:23:30] <duch_kazatel> Carty this isn't about javascript, it's about UX.
[10:23:44] <duch_kazatel> if you want that kind of menu, do what decx is suggesting.
[10:23:47] <Carty> ok, so why is mine bad?
[10:23:57] <Carty> (and UX being User eXperience?)
[10:23:58] <duch_kazatel> how are you going to interpret user intent?
[10:24:14] <duch_kazatel> there's a reason it's broken right now ;)
[10:24:44] <duch_kazatel> if you want a mouseover kind of effect, fly the submenus out to the side.
[10:24:49] <duch_kazatel> not below the heading.
[10:24:59] <Carty> I like the sliding down though...
[10:25:12] <duch_kazatel> then don't do it on hover.
[10:25:15] <duch_kazatel> do it on click.
[10:25:16] <Carty> ok
[10:25:20] <Carty> click then?
[10:25:25] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[10:25:34] <Carty> I apologise for being bad guys, but how might I do that
[10:25:45] <Carty> also, is JavaScript better or JQuery?
[10:25:52] <duch_kazatel> jquery is javascript.
[10:25:55] <Carty> I know
[10:25:57] <duch_kazatel> jquery is a library for javascript.
[10:26:03] <duch_kazatel> it entirely depends on your goals.
[10:26:11] <Carty> but is it better practice to write in JQuery or JS?
[10:26:13] <Carty> ok
[10:26:39] <duch_kazatel> if you're going to really utilize the library, jquery is great.
[10:26:49] <duch_kazatel> if you're using it just so you can, say, power a menu?  ehh....
[10:27:00] <Carty> :/
[10:27:06] <Carty> that's me then :P
[10:27:23] <Carty> can I use my age as an excuse? :D
[10:27:26] <duch_kazatel> in leftNav.js you've got a bunch of $("#main1").mouseover(function() { and $("#main1").mouseleave(function() { type stuff.
[10:27:49] <Carty> I know, I tried to use this without opening both at once and all sorts
[10:28:09] <dan2k3k4> hmm
[10:28:12] <decx> it's not required but most people use ul and li tags for menus
[10:28:13] <duch_kazatel> start with .on() - $('#main1').on('click', function(){});
[10:28:20] <dan2k3k4> how does one include/add js libs to jsfiddle?
[10:28:26] <dan2k3k4> e.g. jquery and bxslider? o_0
[10:28:28] <duch_kazatel> dan2k3k4 look at the left hand side.
[10:28:36] <decx> na that will take over all the clicks inside the submenu as well duch_kazatel
[10:28:39] <duch_kazatel> jquery is via that top dropdown.
[10:28:47] <dan2k3k4> I've clicked on the frameworks part, but how do you select multiple? :s
[10:28:49] <duch_kazatel> decx you're right.
[10:28:58] <Carty> shall I make a JSFiddle?
[10:29:04] <Carty> will that be easier to work with/
[10:29:07] <duch_kazatel> carty yes
[10:29:17] <duch_kazatel> dan2k3k4 you only need jquery, then include bxslider in the external resources.
[10:29:51] <dan2k3k4> duch_kazatel, I presume cdn link for bxslider?
[10:29:55] <duch_kazatel> yes
[10:31:10] <hesco> Here is a jfiddle paste of my issue:  http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=OVVf1C948t
[10:31:54] <duch_kazatel> the bxslider code isn't even included.
[10:32:03] <hesco> I need a jquery snippet which will permit me to grab the VALUE of the state selector so it can be used subsequently in an ajax call.  I have to do this twice on this page.
[10:32:08] <hesco> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=OVVf1C948t
[10:32:36] <duch_kazatel> hesco just save the fiddle with bxslider
[10:32:37] <decx> hesco option doesnt have a selected pseudo selector your value is in the select
[10:32:46] <decx> you're mixing up people duch
[10:32:47] <decx> ;D
[10:32:49] <duch_kazatel> fffff.
[10:32:54] <duch_kazatel> my bad.
[10:33:03] <duch_kazatel> i need more caffeine this morning D:
[10:33:34] <hesco> duch_kazatel: don't know what bxslider is.
[10:33:55] <Carty> http://jsfiddle.net/5ke46/1/
[10:33:56] <Carty> here we go
[10:34:04] <duch_kazatel> hesco ignore me.  i had you mixed up with somebody else.
[10:34:47] <duch_kazatel> Carty jsfiddle can include jquery and jqueryui for you: http://jsfiddle.net/5ke46/2/
[10:36:56] <Carty> duch_kazatel: you probably think I am really stupid, don't you...?
[10:37:02] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[10:37:04] <AlexMPS> Hello :)
[10:37:04] <duch_kazatel> why would I?
[10:37:54] <decx> Carty http://jsfiddle.net/decx/5ke46/5/
[10:39:29] <Carty> duch_kazatel: I just seem to be getting everything wrong...
[10:39:42] <Carty> decx: thank you very much decx , though how do I close the opened menu?
[10:39:54] <decx> eh, i learned so much from failures, don't worry about it
[10:40:20] <decx> you can put thissub.slideToggle() instead of thissub.slideDown()
[10:40:21] <duch_kazatel> Carty you're learning.
[10:41:14] <Carty> thanks guys, just reading through the code to try and understand it (that is how I have learned up until this point, very little use of tutiorials)
[10:41:26] <duch_kazatel> tutorials are a good thing to learn to use.
[10:42:41] <duch_kazatel> also, wrapping divs in anchors is invalid.
[10:42:46] <Carty> yes, I know.  But predominantly I look at other people's code and then visit the documentation page and read how it works and view demos.  I did use Codecademy though and various other tutorials
[10:43:02] <Carty> what does "wrapping divs in anchors" mean?
[10:43:08] <duch_kazatel> <a href=""><div class="sub-link">Parts</div></a>
[10:43:08] <decx> yeah you have to put a inline or inline-block style on that div
[10:43:13] <duch_kazatel> that's not valid.
[10:43:25] <duch_kazatel> <div class="sub-link"><a href="">Parts</a></div>
[10:43:27] <duch_kazatel> that is.
[10:43:33] <Carty> oh...
[10:43:34] <decx> you are not supposed to put block elements in inline elements
[10:44:25] <Carty> you know, sometimes I feel like a div :P
[10:44:47] <Carty> I have one question, what does the .next() do?
[10:45:11] <BillCriswell> It's cool to do <a href="#"><div>...</div></a>.
[10:45:29] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell only if your CSS sets <a> to be block level.
[10:45:51] <decx> Carty $(this) selects the elements that was clicked, next is just the next element in the html order
[10:46:16] <Carty> ooooohhhhhhh
[10:46:21] <Carty> that is so useful
[10:46:23] <decx> in that case this is <div class="main-link">Rolling Stock</div> and the next element is <div id="sub1" class="sub-container">
[10:46:37] <Carty> thank you
[10:49:14] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Right right.
[10:49:48] <BillCriswell> I'm still a fan of being able to give any element a href attribute.
[10:50:11] <Carty> the reason I used the div in the anchor was because I wanted the whole of the div to be a link not just the text,how could I do that the way it is now?
[10:50:33] <decx> can i have some performance testers please? http://canvas.decx.org/ note: it's a game so might be nsfw
[10:50:37] <duch_kazatel> Carty you can remove the div and set the anchor's display to "block"
[10:50:47] <dan2k3k4> duch_kazatel, seems I figured out my problem while trying to create it in jsfiddle :D
[10:50:59] <duch_kazatel> dan2k3k4 good :)
[10:51:02] <duch_kazatel> that happens.
[10:51:17] <duch_kazatel> Carty once the display is block, you can give it a height and width.
[10:51:32] <Carty> duch_kazatel: oh, ok.  Thank you very much Sirs / Madams.  Taught me a lot (without really telling me much at all)
[10:51:37] <dan2k3k4> spent ages wondering why there was a 100px gap... turns out it was in the header, an element that I had position: relative; bottom: 106px; float: left; was causing the problem...
[10:51:56] <duch_kazatel> dan2k3k4 that's always the worst.
[10:51:58] <BillCriswell> decx: Seems ok to me.
[10:51:59] <dan2k3k4> so added a height: 0; to it... seems to fix the problem
[10:52:12] <dan2k3k4> although unsure if I can re-design it
[10:52:33] <dan2k3k4> the whole head is based on 3-4 elements with float: left :/
[10:52:38] <BillCriswell> decx: I'm not sure if I'm bad at this game or it's broke.
[10:52:52] <decx> there's no objective yet
[10:52:57] <decx> ;D
[10:53:05] <BillCriswell> decx: HAha ok
[10:53:38] <decx> just randomly generated levels and trying out gameplay mechanics/weapons
[10:53:52] <duch_kazatel> dan2k3k4 you're using a clearfix, yeah?
[10:54:08] <Carty> another quick question, when do you use the > in in the CSS selector (I know that is not meant for this IRC, but can I still ask it?)
[10:54:14] <decx> my formula for a platformer level. couple of big blocks at the bottom, couple of small blocks at the top and an obstacle
[10:54:18] <decx> ^^
[10:54:26] <duch_kazatel> Carty of course.
[10:54:28] <dan2k3k4> duch_kazatel, ?
[10:54:45] <duch_kazatel> dan2k3k4 to clear the floats?
[10:54:47] <dan2k3k4> duch_kazatel, I have bootstrap + jquery
[10:54:49] <duch_kazatel> !google css clearfix
[10:54:51] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: CSS Clear Fix - David Walsh  http://davidwalsh.name/css-clear-fix
[10:55:00] <dan2k3k4> why would I clear the floats?
[10:55:00] <Carty> so what is that ">" used for?  Or when should I use it?
[10:55:19] <dan2k3k4> Carty, > is for 'sub-elements'
[10:55:38] <duch_kazatel> Carty it's the direct child selector.  let's say you have three levels of divs, but you only wanted the second.  div > div would only select the second level.
[10:55:46] <duch_kazatel> whereas div div selects all divs within other divs.
[10:55:53] <Carty> oh, ok
[10:55:57] <dan2k3k4> like .content > div#slider img.small {}
[10:56:00] <Carty> I was never really sure how the two differed
[10:56:09] <Carty> thanks you
[10:56:48] <dan2k3k4> .content = class="content", > 'then select child' of div id="slider" that has img class="small"
[10:57:15] <Carty> ok, cheers
[10:57:23] <dan2k3k4> <section class="content"><div id="slider"><img class="small"></img></div></section>
[10:57:41] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/kwxcA/ basically.
[11:00:08] <Carty> sorry to bring things back, but I have been playing around with the JSfiddle, but I can't seem to get that display: block on the anchors to work.  http://jsfiddle.net/5ke46/10/  How might i go about it.  Sorry, again
[11:00:31] <hesco> Is there some javascript equivalent to perl's Data::Dumper which will dump an object in a machine readable form to help one discern how to access its attributes?
[11:02:04] <duch_kazatel> hesco huh?
[11:02:19] <decx> console.log(object)
[11:02:19] <duch_kazatel> Carty display: block; is right.  not sure what you're asking...
[11:02:39] <duch_kazatel> Carty if you're going to change them to display: block; leave them wrapped around the divs.
[11:03:03] <Carty> well, if you open the first menu, then the style hasn't been transferred and the anchor is only as big as the text, rather than the 200px
[11:03:11] <Carty> duch_kazatel
[11:05:00] <duch_kazatel> the cascade was killing you : http://jsfiddle.net/5ke46/11/
[11:05:20] <duch_kazatel> brb
[11:05:45] <Carty> also, is it good form to set a div (or other element) to cursor: pointer if it has an interaction that is not necessarily an anchor, or does that confuse people?
[11:06:23] <decx> if it'S an area that's supposed to be clicked the cursor:pointer is appropriate
[11:06:46] <Carty> duch_kazatel: how did you fix that?  What had I done wrong...?
[11:07:17] <Carty> oh, I see it
[11:07:26] <Carty> I just needed display: block with the others
[11:19:30] <hesco> duch_kazatel: in perl if I am working with an unknown object, I can print Dumper( $object ) and see its data structure if not its associated methods.  I'm having trouble sorting out how to pull a value off a select widget for use in an ajax call.  I'm trying to get some sense of how to address that hidden (to me) value attribute.I've tried a number of different ways I've seen suggested in web searches.  But so far, nothing works.
[11:19:45] <duch_kazatel> console.log(data)
[11:19:52] <duch_kazatel> that'll dump out the object/.
[11:20:07] <hesco> thanks, will try that.
[11:20:32] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you mean about the methods part.  javascript has a bunch of inherited methods that won't list out, but they're nontheless.
[11:21:53] <Velveeta> inherited methheads?
[11:22:02] <duch_kazatel> :D
[11:22:02] <hesco> yes, same in perl, you'd have to study the code or at least grep it for ^sub function definitions to learn its methods.
[11:22:44] <Velveeta> hesco: well, you can dump the inherited method names also, it just takes a little extra work, you have to actually iterate over the object properties and log them individually
[11:23:01] <decx> mrw my same answer was ignored beforehand http://i.imgur.com/F2NmetM.gif
[11:23:14] <Velveeta> typically, when iterating over an object, you have to check to see if it's an inherited method/property and exclude it from what you're working with, but in this case, you'd probably want all of them
[11:23:25] <Velveeta> decx: lol
[11:23:29] <hesco> you'd think that being a methhead would be a recessive gene, unlikely to reproduce, and therefore unlikely to be inherited, at least in the presence of actual methaphetamines
[11:23:45] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[11:23:58] <Velveeta> if only all of society's problems could be solved via darwin awards
[11:25:03] <decx> they are, one at a time
[11:25:14] <Velveeta> as a javascript engineer, i should never have to say i'm killing time on irc because i'm waiting for something to compile...... and yet, there it is
[11:25:34] <decx> the beauty of unit tests?
[11:26:02] <Velveeta> the beauty of assisting another project team and having to compile their bloated app
[11:26:07] <duch_kazatel> :(
[11:26:14] <decx> yikes
[11:26:50] <Velveeta> we had this beautiful app written in node and backbone, and then that dev left, and the devs that took it over said "this is hard.. let's redo it in java and jquery spaghetti"
[11:27:12] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[11:27:15] <duch_kazatel> we run both here
[11:27:15] <duch_kazatel> that'
[11:27:18] <duch_kazatel> *that's awesome.
[11:27:29] <Velveeta> and now that i'm finally finding the time to get my hands into its guts, i'm like "this is..... aye yai yai... let's start migrating it over to amd modules"
[11:29:36] <duch_kazatel> anybdoy have any favorite shim libraries out there?
[11:29:53] <duch_kazatel> I am avoiding kicking off this jquery 1.11 migration >.>
[11:37:19] <Rolli> hey guy's im trying to get the values of an input field to make sure the fields add up to 100 http://jsfiddle.net/EqP8k/1/ but its showing the value as 40.00030.000
[11:38:43] <duch_kazatel> Rolli because .val() returns a string.
[11:39:03] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/EqP8k/2/
[11:39:13] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want.
[11:40:06] <Korvin> Why would this: "$('[id^=some_id_beginning]')" work but "$('#' + $('[id^=some_id_beginning]').attr('id'))" doesn't??
[11:40:28] <duch_kazatel> Korvin I'd have to see the html.
[11:40:43] <Korvin> would there ever be a case for that to break?
[11:40:49] <thang> Korvin: youre appending '#' to a jQuery object
[11:40:51] <duch_kazatel> Korvin but something tells me it's the selector difference - the second one doens't match anything.
[11:41:01] <thang> wait actually, nevermind i stopped reading at .attr
[11:41:05] <Korvin> haha thang
[11:41:15] <Korvin> duch_kazatel: that's what I'm saying
[11:41:17] <Rolli> ahh ok thanks duch_kazatel
[11:41:17] <Korvin> how could that be
[11:41:20] <duch_kazatel> $('#' + $('[id^=some_id_beginning]') and $('[id^=some_id_beginning]') are different.
[11:41:29] <Korvin> duch look at the code
[11:41:36] <Korvin> "$('#' + $('[id^=some_id_beginning]').attr('id'))"
[11:41:41] <duch_kazatel> Korvin I am.  that makes no sense.
[11:41:49] <duch_kazatel> you're prepending a hash onto something that's not a string.
[11:41:57] <Korvin> you're not looking at the code
[11:41:58] <duch_kazatel> wait a second.
[11:42:04] <duch_kazatel> sorry, my bad.
[11:42:16] <Korvin> no problem
[11:42:18] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[11:42:26] <Korvin> but I can reliably get this to happen on someone's site
[11:42:37] <Korvin> not in an easily replicable way though
[11:42:48] <duch_kazatel> one sec.  let me poke.
[11:43:04] <Korvin> could it be that the jQuery dom update is on a defer and my script is running before jQuery's index is updated?
[11:43:24] <decx> seems to work fine
[11:43:35] <decx> whyever you would do that
[11:43:36] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/S2Vr4/
[11:43:55] <duch_kazatel> i doubt it's running a deferred object.  it's dropping into sizzle.
[11:44:06] <Korvin> right decx, I understand that it shouldn't happen
[11:44:09] <Rolli> one more question if the total does not add up to 100 then I want the function to end but if it does go in to the rest of the function and do the ajax. is there a quick way to setop the function at a specific line
[11:44:21] <Korvin> It's 1.7.2, I can definitely see it happening right now
[11:44:40] <duch_kazatel> Rolli not sure what you mean.
[11:44:46] <Korvin> there's a forward slash in the id
[11:44:49] <Korvin> could that be it?
[11:44:49] <duch_kazatel> Rolli could you update your fiddle?
[11:45:01] <Korvin> seems to work fine with a forward slash on jsfiddle
[11:45:04] <duch_kazatel> Korvin that shouldn't make a difference.
[11:45:42] <Rolli> http://jsfiddle.net/EqP8k/3/
[11:45:58] <Korvin> haha but $('[id="' + $('[id^=some_id_beginning]').attr('id') + '"]') works
[11:46:05] <Korvin> I think that's it
[11:46:12] <Rolli> so if any of those if statements fire i want to not run the ajax, i could use elseif i guess but was wondering if there is another way
[11:46:16] <decx> whats the point of that anyway Korvin if you just want to select the ones that start with some why not just use that selector
[11:46:36] <Korvin> decx the point is that selecting the element by it's ID using # instead of [id=] fails
[11:46:49] <Korvin> the code example was just to 'prove' that I wasn't mistyping the id
[11:47:05] <decx> i dont get it ^^
[11:47:09] <decx> worked for me
[11:47:16] <duch_kazatel> Korvin worked here, too.
[11:47:32] <duch_kazatel> unless your grander question is whether or not there'd be a potential race condition
[11:47:38] <Korvin> I know, I can't get a replicable case for you at the moment, but it's definitely happening in this virtual machine on this breakpoint
[11:47:42] <Korvin> that's it duch_kazatel
[11:47:53] <Korvin> is there supposed to be a deferred action here
[11:47:56] <duch_kazatel> Korvin it shouldn't be.
[11:48:04] <decx> ah, well then i'm curious too :>
[11:48:15] <decx> just seems wrong to do a selector like this ;)
[11:48:18] <duch_kazatel> i don't know that sizzle does any of that - sizzle doesn't do defferreds afaik
[11:48:31] <duch_kazatel> Rolli you'll need to do a series of if/else if/else checks.
[11:48:33] <Korvin> I know decx, it seems weird for [id='derp'] works while $('#derp') doesn't
[11:48:52] <duch_kazatel> Korvin is there more than one thin on that page with that ID?
[11:49:08] <Rolli> duch_kazatel thats what I figured, just makes the code look messy
[11:49:24] <duch_kazatel> Rolli not at all.  also turn your question inside out and abstract.
[11:49:45] <Korvin> duch_kazatel: the working selector grabs only one object
[11:50:00] <Korvin> that element is inserted directly before the breakpoint I'm on
[11:50:07] <Korvin> here, let me try to reproduce with that info
[11:50:17] <damasceno> Does anyone know how to disable a range of dates using bootstrap datepicker? I tried with onRender, beforeshowday but it's not working. I was able to finally disable the range of date but from TODAY to the date. I need to disable specific dates, for exemplo: 14/06,15/06 and 16/06. Thanks.
[11:50:22] <duch_kazatel> Korvin i'd check the basics.  make sure you're in a doc ready, search the rendered markup for multiple ids, etc.
[11:50:26] <duch_kazatel> rather, a duplicated ID.
[11:50:53] <Korvin> duch_kazatel: dom is loaded because I can select the element at all
[11:51:06] <duch_kazatel> Korvin i'm just tossing ideas out man.
[11:51:11] <Korvin> yeah
[11:51:16] <Korvin> let me try to get a jsfiddle
[11:51:17] <duch_kazatel> Korvin i'd start from the beginning, but that's me.
[11:51:35] <decx> damasceno would make more sense to just not act on these dates for whatever you are doing
[11:52:18] <decx> like on changeDate if date = [nonalloweddates] return false
[11:52:26] <decx> something like that
[11:52:33] <decx> i never used bootstrap datepicker though
[11:53:19] <damasceno> decx: I'm creating a hotel system, so I need to disable a range of dates (The reservation). For example, 15/06, 16/06, 10/08, 11/08 and so on... I can disable from today to X (A range) but it won't work for me... :/
[11:53:34] <Korvin> hmm
[11:53:56] <damasceno> Most of the tutorials show me how to disable past dates and from today to the specific date.
[11:55:33] <decx> i'd look at the daysofweekdisabled method in the dev source and go from there
[11:58:51] <Korvin> yeah, I can't get it to work anywhere else :/
[11:59:24] <decx> a wizard did it
[11:59:30] <decx> perfect explaination
[11:59:32] <Korvin> haha
[12:00:09] <Korvin> It'l happen every time if I trigger it with that breakpoint in the right spot
[12:00:43] <duch_kazatel> Korvin but only with a breakpoint?
[12:01:24] <Korvin> yeah
[12:05:08] <BillCriswell> It's a lot harder to take a quick snooze at your desk when it's a standing desk.
[12:05:20] <Korvin> duch_kazatel: do you want to see this example?
[12:05:26] <Korvin> or decx
[12:06:18] <duch_kazatel> Korvin what'd you PM me?
[12:06:34] <Korvin> link to the screen share thing
[12:06:37] <Korvin> if you click it you'll see
[12:06:43] <Korvin> it's join.me part of logmein
[12:06:49] <Korvin> you can view it within the browser
[12:06:52] <Korvin> but I have to run to liunch
[12:06:56] <duch_kazatel> >.> PMing people without asking isn't cool btw.
[12:07:11] <duch_kazatel> and i'm not doubting your problem, just seems strange.
[12:21:10] <Validatorian> I'm having some issues figuring out how to manipulate jQuery's mouseenter to show based on one criteria (hovering over the title) but hiding on another (leaving container) so you can interact with hidden info. Here's a jsfiddle to show the issue: http://jsfiddle.net/JGehb/
[12:22:36] <decx> if you do function(e) you can check e.target
[12:22:49] <Validatorian> thanks decx, I'll check that out
[12:25:26] <Carty> machomacho: sorry I lost connection.  So you think that having the cursor turn to a pointer would make more sense?
[12:26:03] <duch_kazatel> Carty is this about that thing from earlier?
[12:26:12] <duch_kazatel> with the navigation?
[12:27:01] <Carty> oops, wrong IRC
[12:27:05] <Carty> but yes, it was
[12:27:24] <schiaparelli> hello, i have a question about using https://api.jquery.com/before/, is this an appropriate place to ask?
[12:27:29] <Carty> I headed to #css and asked if they think I should add cursor: pointer; to the main menu box things
[12:27:34] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ schiaparelli
[12:27:34] <b-ot> schiaparelli: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:27:54] <duch_kazatel> Carty it might make sense to, but be aware that the pointer generally means "interactive" in some way.
[12:27:58] <duch_kazatel> often that means via click.
[12:28:19] <NoiseEee> Validatorian: it also might make sense to add more classes
[12:28:23] <Carty> yeah, that was my line of thinking, though I wasn't sure if people associate it with links not jsut interactive
[12:28:39] <duch_kazatel> often they do.
[12:28:59] <Carty> this is why I was torn as to whether or not to change my css to suit this
[12:29:02] <duch_kazatel> you should usually only use it for links.  but it depends.  in your case, I'd leave it for the links.
[12:29:03] <Validatorian> NoiseEee: Can you explain how that would help? The event.target is the $('.tile') container, not the image
[12:29:05] <schiaparelli> ok thanksi want to do something like $(".firstOfMonth").before( ... ) and create an element before every .firstOfMonth that contains the text of the .firstOfMonth element it's being inserted before
[12:29:50] <schiaparelli> right now i'm trying to get that with $(this).text() and it isn't working. i'll freely admit i know v. little js
[12:30:17] <duch_kazatel> schiaparelli can you make a jsfiddle please?
[12:30:36] <schiaparelli> all right! i'll do that and ask in a bit
[12:32:54] <schiaparelli> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/C8Zcx/ hopefully this is illustrative?
[12:34:57] <duch_kazatel> woah that's an oooold version of jquery.
[12:35:03] <duch_kazatel> any way you could update that.
[12:35:04] <duch_kazatel> ?
[12:35:49] <schiaparelli> oops
[12:35:51] <schiaparelli> i chose the wrong but
[12:35:56] <schiaparelli> but actually i figured it out just now
[12:35:58] <schiaparelli> thanks anyway!
[12:36:03] <duch_kazatel> either way, you'll need to manually iterate through each of the appropriate divs
[12:36:13] <duch_kazatel> what'd you come up with?
[12:36:41] <BillCriswell> I just completely forgot ".toUpperCase()" existed.
[12:36:52] <schiaparelli> agh or not, it works in the jsfiddle but not when i put it in my larger thing
[12:36:52] <schiaparelli> hm
[12:37:08] <duch_kazatel> schiaparelli what was the solution you came up with?
[12:37:21] <schiaparelli> http://jsfiddle.net/C8Zcx/1/
[12:38:29] <duch_kazatel> how is it broken in the site?
[12:39:15] <schiaparelli> ah
[12:39:18] <schiaparelli> i just forgot some brackets i think
[12:39:21] <schiaparelli> i feel embarrassed now
[12:39:25] <schiaparelli> i asked a question and fixed it myself
[12:39:27] <duch_kazatel> don't.
[12:39:37] <duch_kazatel> that's half the point of this place.
[12:39:52] <duch_kazatel> I have a little R2-D2 on my desk that I explain problems to sometimes to figure them out.
[12:40:23] <schiaparelli> yeah
[12:40:33] <schiaparelli> when i work on homework sometimes it's just nice to talk through a problem to someone
[12:40:42] <schiaparelli> so i can clarify the logic when i try to put it in words
[12:40:46] <duch_kazatel> yup.  it forces it through a different part of your brain.
[12:41:05] <decx> good job using a function for before. always great when those do the trick and you dont have to go through all the elements
[12:41:19] <duch_kazatel> yeah that's a smart move.
[12:41:24] <duch_kazatel> i'd forgotten that exists.
[12:41:51] <decx> i use those all the time for some things but i'm still surprised that they work basicly for everything
[12:42:09] <duch_kazatel> i'm currently working on migrating our codebase from like 1.8 to 1.11
[12:43:37] <NoiseEee> why
[12:44:11] <decx> been through that a while ago
[12:44:14] <decx> but with 1.7
[12:44:18] <decx> so many live
[12:44:36] <duch_kazatel> a few reasons.  one of 'em is that .trigger('click') doesn't work correctly in IE8.
[12:45:06] <duch_kazatel> and i want to finally force people to stop doing browser detection.
[12:45:19] <duch_kazatel> brb
[12:45:21] <duch_kazatel> lunch
[12:46:53] <damasceno> Does anyone know how to disable a range of dates using bootstrap datepicker? I tried with onRender, beforeshowday but it's not working.

[13:21:10] <duch_lunch> are you able to do a jsfiddle of it?
[13:28:53] <Silfa> can anyone help me with a problem? i cant scroll a div and i have no clue why it doesnt work - > http://collabedit.com/4yxvm

[13:34:41] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/S4FNd/
[13:34:44] <duch_kazatel> overflow: scroll
[13:34:52] <duch_kazatel> brb
[13:36:39] <Silfa> the problem isnt he log
[13:36:46] <Silfa> the content isnt scrolling
[13:42:53] <duch_kazatel> what content?
[13:44:10] <duch_kazatel> you mean the content div?
[13:44:28] <Silfa> yep
[13:45:18] <duch_kazatel> your code doesn't have anything writing into #content, but setting a height on it, and then overflow: scroll; will do it.
[13:45:57] <Silfa> what do you mean with i am not writing anything into it
[13:45:57] <duch_kazatel> unless i'm misunderstanding what you mean by "i cant scroll a div"
[13:46:23] <Silfa> http://212.53.140.30/~minecraft1/
[13:47:07] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to make the top div scroll to the last line when it's inserted or....
[13:47:13] <Silfa> yep
[13:48:18] <mattyh88> hi, can someone here explain to me why the 2nd submit() is needed here on line #24?
[13:48:41] <mattyh88> why doesn't the form get submitted with the submit function on line #2
[13:48:48] <duch_kazatel> mattdawson where?
[13:48:54] <duch_kazatel> err, mattyh88
[13:48:58] <mattyh88> http://hayageek.com/jquery-ajax-form-submit/
[13:49:56] <duch_kazatel> mattyh88 did you read the code example all the way through, including comments?
[13:50:45] <mattyh88> duch_kazatel: yes it says callback handler for the first submit and "submit the form" for the 2nd submit .. but I would've thought the form would get submitted without having the 2nd submit in place
[13:50:58] <duch_kazatel> keep reading.
[13:51:00] <duch_kazatel> specifically line 20.
[13:51:20] <duch_kazatel> e.preventDefault() stops the form from submitting
[13:51:43] <duch_kazatel> this is a really rountabout way to prevent initial submitted, run ajax, and then submit the form,.
[13:52:14] <mattyh88> what do you mean with "rountabout"
[13:52:19] <duch_kazatel> *roundabout
[13:52:22] <duch_kazatel> not sure why they're including the second submit in the first place.
[13:52:58] <mattyh88> duch_kazatel: yeah me neither, bit confused
[13:54:12] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[13:54:23] <mattyh88> duch_kazatel: if i remove the preventDefault line, the post isn't happening either
[13:55:01] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't remove that in the first place.  in fact, traditionally you'd do that first before anything else.
[13:55:11] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to figure out how to submit a form via ajax?
[13:56:13] <mattyh88> duch_kazatel: yes .. the form should be submitted when an input field changes
[13:56:39] <duch_kazatel> woah why are you submitting on every change?
[13:56:43] <Velveeta_> yowza
[13:56:52] <duch_kazatel> you realize that'll submit once for every letter entered, right?
[13:57:39] <Velveeta_> well, an input field doesn't trigger change until blurred i believe
[13:57:44] <Velveeta_> but i'm not positive about that
[13:57:55] <NoiseEee> also that resource is balls
[13:57:57] <Velveeta_> but still, submitting a form on every blur is still pretty inefficient
[13:58:05] <duch_kazatel> http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/change.html
[13:58:09] <duch_kazatel> "The event should fire when the text input is blurred AND its contents have changed since the user focused on it."
[13:58:24] <Velveeta_> right
[13:58:36] <mattyh88> yeh, it doesn't change on every added letter :)
[13:58:50] <mattyh88> only when a checkbox is checked or unchecked or when a text field lost focus
[13:59:25] <duch_kazatel> huh, well i'll be
[14:00:21] <Silfa> duch_kazatel: if i just load my file into the div and then try to scroll to the bottom it works, but not if i calculate my condition beforehand, even though the condition for the if is met
[14:00:31] <Silfa> http://jsfiddle.net/S4FNd/
[14:00:38] <Silfa> with that it scrolls down perfectly
[14:00:43] <Silfa> but all the time
[14:01:49] <duch_kazatel> Silfa huh?  you realize line 6 gets caluclated once, right?  and stores a static value?
[14:01:54] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't get recalculated.
[14:02:32] <Silfa> it gets recalculated after every intervall
[14:02:43] <duch_kazatel> where?
[14:02:50] <duch_kazatel> ah yes opkay.
[14:02:51] <duch_kazatel> *okay
[14:02:58] <mattyh88> duch_kazatel: so if I have my code setup like on that page i copied in here, why does the amount of requests always gets added with one .. so lets say I check a checkbox, a new request gets added in my google developer bar, but if I would click that checkbox again, 2 new requests get added, if i click again, 3 new requests get added etc etc ... any clue why that could be
[14:03:05] <duch_kazatel> i'd bet you want to do that after you push in your content, but meh.
[14:04:17] <duch_kazatel> mattyh88 "like on that page i copied in here" - something tells me you're binding your listener multiple times.
[14:04:36] <duch_kazatel> but it's hard to know without seeing the code.
[14:05:21] <Silfa> duch_kazatel: the function i pass to setIntervall gets called every 1000ms in that case right? so i check if my div is scrolled all to the bottom before i update the content -> then i update the content -> if it was scrolled to the bottom before the update, scroll down again, else leave it that way
[14:05:29] <Silfa> that is the behaviour that i want
[14:05:52] <duch_kazatel> Silfa one sec.
[14:05:58] <mattyh88> duch_kazatel: right that was it .. the callback handler was inside the "on change input"
[14:06:48] <duch_kazatel> mattyh88 so bind the handler outside of there and you're good.
[14:06:57] <Silfa> and it does scroll down every time if i dont do the calculation beforehand. and if i do the calculation, it does not scroll down, even though isScrolledToBottom is true, i checked that
[14:07:02] <mattyh88> duch_kazatel: yeah did that :) fixed now :)
[14:07:03] <mattyh88> thx
[14:07:13] <duch_kazatel> Silfa I was able to get exactly that working here (on the wrong section at least; http://jsfiddle.net/S4FNd/1/
[14:07:53] <duch_kazatel> it'll take some different massaging, but that keeps you at the bottom.
[14:08:19] <Silfa> yeah i know that the 2 lines at the bottom should scroll it down
[14:08:28] <Silfa> they do if i dont do the calculation
[14:08:47] <Silfa> but they dont if i do the calculation
[14:09:09] <Silfa> thats what i dont understand
[14:09:22] <duch_kazatel> huh?  which calculation?
[14:09:34] <Silfa>  var isScrolledToBottom = out.scrollHeight - out.clientHeight <= out.scrollTop + 1;
[14:09:46] <duch_kazatel> taking that out will cause an error.
[14:10:07] <Silfa> http://jsfiddle.net/S4FNd/
[14:10:09] <Silfa> like that
[14:10:23] <duch_kazatel> you didn't save your changes.
[14:10:49] <Silfa> working now?
[14:10:58] <duch_kazatel> it's staying at the top...
[14:11:05] <duch_kazatel> did you hit "update" after making your changes?
[14:11:47] <hesco> At https://gist.github.com/hesco/7c3a412ab5424b0bb02f , I reproduce a snippet of jquery code which works if the user makes the right choices the first time, but if the user changes their mind, and chooses a second or subsequent facility_type, then the change event is not reflected in a change to div.facility_name, although the alert does fire showing me that I have the expected facility_type.  What is missing which might make this form a
[14:11:49] <hesco>  bit more forgiving, please?
[14:11:54] <Silfa> the log is staying at the top of course, i have the problem with the content div. the site cant simulate that because it cant get the content
[14:12:20] <duch_kazatel> Silfa "here's a test case that isn't much of a test case tia"
[14:12:54] <Silfa> http://212.53.140.30/~minecraft1/index2.html
[14:13:01] <Silfa> thats the version without the calculation running on my server
[14:13:04] <Silfa> you can see it there
[14:14:16] <repxl> can you check whats the client desktop resolution and than use a complete different .css file for that user?
[14:14:28] <Silfa> everytime i scroll away, it scrolls back down, and it scrolls down too if new contant is added
[14:14:40] <__joshua___> repxl: media querys
[14:14:54] <duch_kazatel> repxl don't load different css like that.  use media queries instead.
[14:14:55] <Silfa> but with the check it doesnt ever scroll down
[14:15:14] <repxl> duch_kazatel i go google it i first hear about it
[14:17:44] <zumba_addict> hi folks, what do you think aboug gumby? it was being suggested by a new person here at work
[14:19:53] <n0x_42> Could someone explain why I have to click twice to call all of a function? http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/1zgr2q/could_someone_explain_why_i_have_to_click_twice/
[14:22:21] <__joshua___> didn't reddit answer it for ya?
[14:22:58] <n0x_42> Nope.
[14:23:15] <__joshua___> k, firstly, don't use your own click handler
[14:23:24] <__joshua___> use the tabs event
[14:23:52] <__joshua___> you are relying on state that may or may not be set by jquery ui (such as active)
[14:24:31] <n0x_42> Ok, so would "load" be the best event to use? Something like $( ".selector" ).on( "tabsload", function( event, ui ) {} );
[14:24:35] <__joshua___> $( ".selector" ).tabs({ activate: function( event, ui ) {}});
[14:24:48] <n0x_42> Ahh ok I will try that.
[14:25:56] <__joshua___> if using async tabs, then use load, if not, don't
[14:26:04] <n0x_42> Absolutely perfect, thanks!
[14:28:04] <__joshua___> :D
[14:31:31] <Silfa> duch_kazatel: refined the testcases a bit: http://212.53.140.30/~minecraft1/index.html , should scroll to the bottom every time when there is a output on the log-div. http://212.53.140.30/~minecraft1/index2.html should scroll down everytime, and it does that. only difference: no if block around the log-div and scroll-to bottom part.
[14:32:13] <Silfa> and it enters the if-block of the first one too
[14:32:22] <Silfa> because you see the output at least once
[14:32:27] <Silfa> but it doesnt scroll down
[14:33:30] <SuperPhly> What's the shorthand way to take a data- attribute and apply that value as css to the element?
[14:34:11] <duch_kazatel> Silfa sorry, i'm not going to dump through a full site to help.  i don't have time to =/
[14:34:12] <SuperPhly> in other words <div data-background="a.jpg"></div> and set the css background-image:url('a.jpg')
[14:34:55] <Silfa> what do you mean with a full site
[14:35:01] <Silfa> thats just that small script :(
[14:35:11] <duch_kazatel> $('#thing').css('background-image', $this.data('background'));
[14:35:15] <duch_kazatel> or something like that,
[14:35:30] <SuperPhly> ah, i was trying to get the value first then apply it down the chain
[14:45:56] <hesco> that was a never mind, investigating the last error I reported here revealed a bug elsewhere in my code.
[14:54:00] <mortal1> say i have 3 li's , and I wish to select li 1 and 2, what's the best way to do so? li:nth-child(1,2) ...?  (ok i know that doesn't work, but it looks like it should :^)
[14:56:36] <Zzaichik> li:nth-child(1), li:nth-child(2) {}
[14:57:13] <mortal1> Zzaichik: ...eh, we have to support ie8
[14:57:43] <mortal1> You can't see my face, but believe me it's filled with dissapointment
[14:57:49] <Zzaichik> Then use jquery to give specific classnames
[14:57:59] <Zzaichik> or just give them specific classnames to begin with
[14:58:14] <mortal1> you know, that's a fair point
[14:58:36] <Zzaichik> ;p
[14:59:11] <mrkie> hey
[14:59:31] <duch_kazatel> i have to support IE8, too.  mortal1 that's not that bad.
[14:59:34] <duch_kazatel> brb restarting.
[15:00:30] <mrkie> i have a question, i'm using a script that will automatically change all my id's of my code that is using jquery too, so if i point to id's - the code doesn't work after i run the script, my script will not work, but name attributes will not get changed by the script, so my question is, can i use this script with name attributes instead of id's? http://jsfiddle.net/j7KKx/
[15:01:30] <mrkie> i just changed the id's to name attributes but sure it did not work, it should be something i need to change into the jquery code, don't know what
[15:01:34] <mrkie> is it ppssible?
[15:02:06] <ryanneufeld> mrkie: it's not clear from your demo what your problem is
[15:02:18] <mrkie> hmmm ok well
[15:03:34] <mrkie> you see i use id's, i use a chrome extension to grap the source so it will be totally recompiled, all the id's will get different names in order to grab the css's etc etc, but that extension will not touch name attributes, so i need name attributes with the script in the jsfiddle link
[15:03:52] <mortal1> duch_kazatel: I think it was a conspiricy by MS, they make each version of IE only *slighly* better than the last, so we always say 'at least ie n is better than ie n-1'
[15:04:07] <duch_kazatel> mortal1 derp.
[15:04:08] <mrkie> ryanneufeld: so it will produce the same effect
[15:04:16] <mrkie> the toggle function
[15:04:25] <duch_kazatel> IE9 is when it started being decent.  10 and 11 are fine.
[15:04:42] <mrkie> ryanneufeld: can you do that?
[15:04:54] <ryanneufeld> mrkie: I still have no idea what you're trying to do
[15:05:00] <ryanneufeld> sounds like you're trying to change Ids
[15:05:09] <ryanneufeld> or duplicate them
[15:05:15] <mrkie> i want to get the same working code but without id's
[15:05:19] <decx> just rewrite to use classes instead
[15:05:33] <ryanneufeld> mrkie: yeah, what decx said
[15:05:54] <mrkie> decx: can you example that?
[15:06:03] <duch_kazatel> "can you example that" lol
[15:06:34] <mrkie> yeah because i have no clue yet what i can do with that answer
[15:06:47] <ryanneufeld> mrkie: well, where you see id=""
[15:06:48] <mrkie> otherwise i wouldn't be here probably
[15:06:55] <ryanneufeld> make it say class=""
[15:07:04] <ryanneufeld> and then when you see #someid
[15:07:09] <mrkie> i try if my extension will not touch class atributes
[15:07:10] <ryanneufeld> use .someclass instead
[15:07:35] <ryanneufeld> so your extension is modifying the html on the page?
[15:08:30] <mrkie> yeah, to be more specific it is because it will get a snapshot from selected elements
[15:08:52] <mrkie> https://github.com/kdzwinel/SnappySnippet
[15:09:08] <mrkie> Chrome/Chromium extension that allows easy CSS+HTML extraction of specific DOM element. Created snippet can be then exported to CodePen, jsFiddle or JS Bin with one click.
[15:09:09] <mrkie> Other features:
[15:09:09] <mrkie> cleans up HTML (removing unnecessary attributes, fixing indentation)
[15:09:11] <mrkie> but but
[15:09:44] <mrkie> it is because i have a very large howto i made to program php, i make textareas to grab source of php code, they don't work after i grab the code
[15:10:13] <mrkie> because the id's will get a change of the name and not within the JS
[15:10:23] <mrkie> so i need probably something else
[15:10:37] <mrkie> and i tried just to change the id attributes to classes but that did not work
[15:10:56] <mrkie> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/j7KKx/1/
[15:12:26] <ryanneufeld> mrkie: if you're not going to follow my instructions, I can't help you
[15:12:44] <mrkie> ryanneufeld: i which i could, i only program php a lot
[15:12:57] <ryanneufeld> mrkie: funny, me too
[15:13:00] <ryanneufeld> it's my day job
[15:13:09] <mrkie> can you give me an example of what you mean on my jsfiddle post?
[15:13:21] <ryanneufeld> replace your IDS with classes
[15:13:31] <mrkie> i did here http://jsfiddle.net/j7KKx/1/
[15:13:37] <ryanneufeld> no, you didn't
[15:13:47] <ryanneufeld> you didn't update your code
[15:13:52] <ryanneufeld> only the html
[15:13:55] <ryanneufeld> which is why that's not working
[15:13:58] <duch_kazatel> mrkie # is used for IDs.
[15:14:02] <duch_kazatel> hrh
[15:14:04] <duch_kazatel> *hth
[15:14:08] <ryanneufeld> duch_kazatel: I told him that
[15:14:11] <mrkie> atleast i did it within the html
[15:14:18] <decx> jquery selectors are at their most basic built like this $('#id') $('.class') $('tagname') $('[attribute]')
[15:14:21] <ryanneufeld> you could have done less
[15:14:32] <ryanneufeld> ?selectors @mrkie
[15:14:32] <duch_kazatel> mrkie sure.  now you need to do the other end.
[15:14:37] <duch_kazatel> !selectors
[15:14:54] <decx> it's 
[15:14:55] <ryanneufeld> ?botsnack
[15:15:01] <ryanneufeld> `selectors
[15:15:15] <ryanneufeld> `botsnack
[15:15:26] <ryanneufeld> b-ot: hello? Are you home?
[15:15:27] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: better not tell you now.
[15:15:37] <ryanneufeld> `api selectors
[15:15:37] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: No matches.
[15:15:41] <decx> or is it `
[15:15:41] <ryanneufeld> `api selector
[15:15:42] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: No matches.
[15:15:46] <decx> i cant write these :>
[15:15:47] <ryanneufeld> `api.selector
[15:15:48] <duch_kazatel> !api selector
[15:15:48] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: No matches.
[15:16:09] <mrkie> decx: ok more like this http://jsfiddle.net/j7KKx/2/
[15:16:19] <ryanneufeld> mrkie: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[15:16:38] <decx> your link selector is still an id
[15:16:58] <mrkie> ryanneufeld: yeah ok but that link will not be executed
[15:17:15] <mrkie> woops
[15:17:16] <mrkie> i see
[15:17:16] <mrkie> :)
[15:17:31] <decx> note that this won'T work if you want multiple of these on the page
[15:17:35] <mrkie> this is it: http://jsfiddle.net/j7KKx/3/
[15:17:43] <decx> you have to create a relation between the two elements
[15:17:57] <decx> either by having predictable markup or data-* attributes
[15:19:49] <mrkie> decx: you are right, it will run the function on the same time to all textareas
[15:20:06] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/j7KKx/4/
[15:20:31] <decx> see i missed a #source too
[15:20:32] <decx> lol
[15:21:28] <decx> there we go http://jsfiddle.net/decx/j7KKx/5/
[15:22:33] <mrkie> decx: there are still id's since they get changed by my script
[15:23:06] <decx> ids dont matter for this, but not the data-source-id attributes in the markup
[15:23:09] <mrkie> you're using data-source-id hmm that's different
[15:23:45] <decx> if you don't want these your markup has to be predictable. so you can traverse from your link to its appropirate source textarea
[15:24:55] <decx> in this case that would be http://jsfiddle.net/decx/j7KKx/6/
[15:25:51] <decx> i wrote appro pirate and no 'arr aye mateys' in sight. get real #jquery
[15:33:53] <mrkie> decx: it just works when i change the page with the extension (in order for future work with my howto's for personal use) http://jsfiddle.net/j7KKx/7/
[15:34:44] <mrkie> so it is the best option i have i think this way, right?
[15:35:07] <glaksmono> hi, i have a text "<span class="foo">Foo</span>" and i wanna put it as part of $("<div>Test hello " + test + " world!</div>").. it seems to shift the </span> into </span class="foo"> at the end of the html element, thoughts?
[15:35:08] <mrkie> it will about 30 textareas
[15:35:12] <decx> it's an option
[15:35:39] <mrkie> decx: yeah a fast option to walk with
[15:36:04] <duch_kazatel> glaksmono wat.  have a fiddle?
[15:41:25] <glaksmono> duch_kazatel, https://gist.github.com/glaksmono/8a18da304bbbaa59daec
[15:41:49] <duch_kazatel> wut
[15:41:57] <glaksmono> duch_kazatel, where question =  hi <span="foo-name">foo</span>
[15:42:05] <glaksmono> in a string
[15:42:25] <Wesley> Is wordpress a platform?
[15:42:50] <duch_kazatel> glaksmono huh?  that's still not making any sense.  can you make a full functioning case in jsfiddle?
[15:43:28] <duch_kazatel> glaksmono are you trying to get the ID of a span?
[15:47:35] <mrkie> decx: can you also hide with jq based on the name attribute value?
[15:48:03] <duch_kazatel> .attr('name');
[15:48:16] <mrkie> with the selector
[15:48:22] <mrkie> $('[attribute]')
[15:48:39] <mrkie> or instead $('tagname')
[15:48:50] <decx> name is just another attribute
[15:56:50] <mrkie> decx: yeah, i agree with your solution that you have provided, but isn't this a shorter workarround if it worked http://jsfiddle.net/j7KKx/8/ ?
[15:57:21] <decx> the whole point was to make it work with multiple elements on the page
[15:57:25] <duch_kazatel> holy balls that's slow.
[15:57:55] <mrkie> that's right
[15:58:20] <Fernandos> k, this is confusing me.. I'd just like to fadeOut(600) 1s after the selected class isn't hovered anymore. And fadeIn(600), when the the area is hovered for 1s. But the animation repeats, or doesn't complete etc.
[15:58:32] <Fernandos> Here's the code that's confusing me http://pastie.org/8847212
[15:58:51] <Fernandos> Tried both version, with equal result
[15:58:54] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos i trust you see the error right?
[15:58:57] <duch_kazatel> the first one.
[15:59:03] <mrkie> decx: do i have the same problem like it will open all textareas on one press like with the .classes in the beginning?
[15:59:23] <mrkie> with name instead of id
[16:00:02] <duch_kazatel> can anchors have the name attribute?
[16:00:14] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: although the coincidence of 1337 characters on this one. I don't see the error, I'm afraid. Well I'm not not sure.
[16:00:35] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos you're missing a quote around your selector.
[16:00:40] <decx> there was a time when you had to put names on an anchor because index.html#stuff didnt go to the id #stuff
[16:00:48] <duch_kazatel> that's right.
[16:01:35] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: ah, that was a copy/paste error then. The code doesn't miss a quote.
[16:02:04] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos you sure you don't mean mouseenter instead of mouseover?
[16:03:43] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: I tried both. But in any version the caption class flickers when hovered, or it keeps visible, even after mouseleave or mouseout
[16:04:41] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos so first of all you want the first syntax, but second of all yopu want to use the native jquery mechanism instead.
[16:04:53] <Fernandos> you mean stop() right?
[16:05:07] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/delay/
[16:06:39] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: the settimeout was just to make sure the effect isn't run again, despite the use of stop(), but it's not effective somehow
[16:07:01] <duch_kazatel> sure, because .stop() and settimeout know nothing of one another.
[16:07:13] <duch_kazatel> use .delay)_
[16:07:16] <duch_kazatel> *.delay()
[16:09:56] <mrkie> decx: i think the code will be more short if i code it this way: http://jsfiddle.net/DNQ7H/99/ (just an example)
[16:10:22] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: I did, but the caption keeps repeating fadein/out when hovered. http://pastie.org/8847231
[16:10:49] <duch_kazatel> mouseenter, not over.
[16:10:49] <mrkie> decx: i have no idea yet howto hide it...
[16:11:46] <mrkie> well just .hide but i have to port it like the url i have given above
[16:12:41] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: hmm, that plus stop instead of filter seems to fix that problem, with much shorter code also.
[16:13:03] <duch_kazatel> okay
[16:14:19] <duch_kazatel> fffff why do people do their goddamn browser detection in javascript?
[16:14:19] <duch_kazatel> jesus
[16:17:20] <__joshua___> yeah its bad.  but i do it.  for reasons.
[16:17:29] <duch_kazatel> then don't do it in jquery.
[16:17:32] <duch_kazatel> :(
[16:17:35] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: I agree, modernizr should also not be necessary, if only browser vendors provided us with a feature-detection function. Browser detection with js can be very effective with js, if you target UA browser version+browser+bugs/quirks or specialities.
[16:17:47] <tw2113> feature support detection ftw
[16:17:56] <Fernandos> But usually it's a stupid idea.
[16:18:10] <duch_kazatel> honestly, there have only been a handful of times that not all browsers supported something I needed.
[16:18:17] <duch_kazatel> i rarely run into browser issues these days.
[16:18:20] <duch_kazatel> *cross-browser
[16:18:21] <__joshua___> every day we got phonecalls: the site isn't working blah blah blah.  so now we complain to the user if they are not on our white list.  evil but necessary (for our work)
[16:18:37] <duch_kazatel> what's your whitelist?
[16:18:45] <Fernandos> good question^
[16:19:02] <__joshua___> minimum versions for chrome, ff, safari, ie, opera, android browser
[16:19:10] <Fernandos> IE11 isn't widespread at all.. does it even support WebGL?
[16:19:12] <duch_kazatel> how far back do you support for IE?
[16:19:17] <__joshua___> 9
[16:19:23] <duch_kazatel> we're about to drop 8
[16:19:25] <duch_kazatel> so close.
[16:19:34] <Fernandos> __joshua___: 9 comes with a lot of things that don't work yet too..
[16:19:35] <__joshua___> (we do intensive canvas/svg mapping.  just cant do it in old browser)
[16:19:50] <__joshua___> yeah, we tell people do use chrome/ff
[16:20:03] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos sometimes you don't have the luxury of tellings users to go away.
[16:20:09] <duch_kazatel> 9 and above are all pretty popular ;)
[16:20:29] <__joshua___> yeah, our users are already paying for our site, so we can tell them.  rare luxury.
[16:20:45] <duch_kazatel> that's awesome.  not a public-facing dela i assume?
[16:20:48] <duch_kazatel> *deal
[16:21:14] <__joshua___> thats right, only shitty demoing is public
[16:21:17] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: My clients used to agree with what's popular according to previous stats on their site. Back in 2009 it was IE8, which was good enough. But adding a Browser-Upgrade warning for IE6 Users helped a lot to now have more Chrome/Firefox users than IE users.
[16:21:31] <Fernandos> The client's only client's are other corps.
[16:21:43] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos we don't have that luxury.
[16:22:00] <Fernandos> I guess the complained to their admin, that their browser is old or broken now.
[16:22:25] <duch_kazatel> honestly, chrome has given me about as many problems as old IE.
[16:22:33] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: What are you doing then? Using PIE.htc?
[16:22:43] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[16:22:46] <duch_kazatel> to avoid problems?
[16:23:00] <Fernandos> yeah
[16:23:17] <duch_kazatel> I tend to write clear and concise code.
[16:23:26] <duch_kazatel> i picked up a lot of good habits early on.
[16:24:37] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: browser support with js isn't really a problem. CSS is the ugly thing, causing compatibility issues (actually it's the lazy vendors, but yeah).
[16:24:48] <duch_kazatel> css doesn't often give me problems either.
[16:24:59] <duch_kazatel> we have to give flawless support to IE8 and above here - you quickly learn what's what when that's the case.
[16:25:35] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: you must be creating pretty non-modern looking or image heavy sites then, because border-radius etc. will force you to do that.
[16:25:37] <duch_kazatel> and some DOM APIs are bugged.  wekbit's implementation of pushstates is broken.  they still haven't fixed it.
[16:25:39] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:25:41] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[16:25:51] <duch_kazatel> a combination of sass and smart thinking is all you need.
[16:25:56] <duch_kazatel> and graceful degredation.
[16:26:12] <duch_kazatel> we don't rely on pixel-perfect accuracy accross browsers.
[16:26:24] <duch_kazatel> we rely on "does this look right to the QA person?:
[16:26:41] <Fernandos> pushstate.. yeah I wrote some piece using it that yesterday, then tried firefox and chrome and quickly gave up to wait another year for it to be polished.
[16:26:51] <paul_uk> hi all.  anyone using bootstrap 3 here?  whenever i click a button to show the modal.  the page scrolls to the top.  its annoying.  its obviously something im doing.  but i cannot find out what.  has anyone had this issue and how did you resolve it?  thanks
[16:26:51] <duch_kazatel> you'll be waiting even longer.
[16:27:25] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: how would sass improve browser compatibility? I use stylus btw. switched from sass to less to that..
[16:27:42] <duch_kazatel> webkit's been waiting on a fix for a loooong time.  they refuse to fix it.  irrc jquery core has more fixes in it for chrome than any other vendor.
[16:27:47] <duch_kazatel> and sass does my prefixing for me.
[16:27:50] <duch_kazatel> less does the same.
[16:27:52] <duch_kazatel> you know the story.
[16:27:56] <duch_kazatel> when i need prefixing.
[16:28:26] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: ahhh.. k you mean that.. well that's true.
[16:29:04] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: IE is still out. I'm not sure how you manage your clients to work with IE7 (you don't have to be compat to IE6, do you?)..
[16:29:10] <mrkie> decx: i go with your code and not with a name attribute or id attribute, your code works the way it will work with multiple elements, i see with name attribute it is not working with multiple elements too: http://jsfiddle.net/j7KKx/10/ so http://jsfiddle.net/decx/j7KKx/6/ is pretty fine i hope
[16:29:58] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos not every company has clients like yours :) we're a major ecommerce company.
[16:30:07] <duch_kazatel> so my "clients" are "the general public".
[16:30:27] <duch_kazatel> we target the browsers that still give us good money.
[16:30:32] <duch_kazatel> which is why we support IE8 and above.
[16:30:45] <decx> mrkie yes that will work fine
[16:31:48] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: I mean, if your clients use IE7, you can't do progressive enhancement without creating a huge asynchronity between your IE and Chrome users ie. (btw. I worked for a huge ecommerce business too, which luckily focused on mobile more than desktop, thus having IE8 as the lower limit)
[16:32:02] <duch_kazatel> our lower limit is 8...
[16:32:09] <duch_kazatel> sorry if I misspoke earlier.
[16:32:21] <mrkie> decx: doesn't have jquery some kind of a regular expression that will get $('[name=source*]').select(); so the [name=source*] could be [name=source1] or [name=source2] ?
[16:33:18] <decx> there is but it's not efficient
[16:33:25] <Fernandos> ahh, k.. IE8 is almost forgivable then. IE7 to IE6 differene is neglible from a developer PoV
[16:33:42] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: thanks for your help btw. =)
[16:33:46] <decx> mrkie http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[16:33:47] <DAGr8> hi there
[16:34:01] <Fernandos> That fixed my  code =)
[16:34:02] <duch_kazatel> IE7 brought some good changes.  9 and 10 are fine.  11 is pleasant.
[16:34:07] <DAGr8> anyone can tell me why my smooth scroll works on firefox and not in chrome
[16:34:11] <DAGr8> http://www.renocustom.com/gallery.html
[16:34:22] <duch_kazatel> the only issue i have with IE is that they follow the spec for caching.  nobody else does.
[16:34:40] <DAGr8> positive red and g26 are the only atual links in the page
[16:36:55] <__joshua___> off topic, but im getting no love in #css.  anyone help with a quick layout problem?  query in fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/a4atZ/
[16:38:36] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: I think what's missing is a cross-vendor shared and supported repository containing only the main algorithms for each parser feature for JS and CSS in a "neutral language" like C. That would help to implement at least the Spec correctly in all browsers.
[16:39:02] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos that actually exists.
[16:39:08] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: really?
[16:39:10] <Fernandos> where
[16:39:14] <__joshua___> or implement a gui in canvas.
[16:39:17] <__joshua___> heh
[16:39:28] <duch_kazatel> the W3C specs.
[16:39:34] <duch_kazatel> they contain the definitions.
[16:39:58] <Fernandos> __joshua___: max-width:100%; and set overflow:hidden;
[16:40:13] <__joshua___> on ul?
[16:40:20] <duch_kazatel> the problem is they weren't very specific for certain cases.  many bugs arise because of issues like "where does one container start?  the same pixel the last one ends?"
[16:40:31] <Fernandos> on parent
[16:40:54] <duch_kazatel> the other issue is that microsoft is still dealing with the legacy of JScript in their browser.
[16:41:35] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: the spec writers then DEFINITELY need a spec acceptance test and verification of edge cases. That would be the only reason, why I could believe those guys that they need 10years for HTML5
[16:41:50] <__joshua___> Fernandos: doesn't help?  In that in example I want want ul to be only exactly as large as the li's. ie there is no red visible
[16:42:17] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos i think you're confused about how that process worked and what's happening now :)
[16:42:26] <DAGr8> __joshua___ why dont you give the ul the same width as the li
[16:43:05] <Fernandos> hehe probably right
[16:43:14] <__joshua___> because the div might be 800px, or 1200px.  and i want 'columns' of li
[16:43:41] <duch_kazatel> __joshua___ are you using floats to get that effect?  any reason to can't use inline-block?
[16:43:48] <duch_kazatel> *you
[16:44:18] <DAGr8> hehe i c everyone helping the css guy . ca anyone care to explain whats wrong with my jquery stuf ? lol
[16:44:22] <tw2113> that moment when I end up on ryanneufeld's employer's website
[16:45:03] <duch_kazatel> DAGr8 your UX is very confusing.
[16:45:13] <DAGr8> oh ?
[16:45:33] <duch_kazatel> i move my mouse to get to an image and everything moves around preventing me from getting there.
[16:45:36] <duch_kazatel> why not use a modal?
[16:45:39] <DAGr8> yes
[16:45:42] <DAGr8> i was jsut testing this
[16:45:43] <duch_kazatel> a lightbox kind of thing?
[16:45:50] <__joshua___> duch_kazatel: even if you inline-block, the ul takes up the full width of its parent
[16:45:54] <DAGr8> i shoud lhave removed it before asking a question
[16:45:54] <DAGr8> hehe
[16:46:05] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[16:46:08] <DAGr8> want me to
[16:46:43] <duch_kazatel> what's the "smooth scroll"?>
[16:46:45] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: haha, find what you needed?
[16:47:02] <Fernandos> DAGr8: here's what I wrote a few years earlier and it still works: $('#scrollTo a[href]$="myID"').click(function() {         $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop:0 }, '2000');         return false;     });
[16:47:28] <tw2113> almost. I had the lyrics to "Won't Get Fooled Again" by The Who incorrect in my head
[16:47:32] <duch_kazatel> DAGr8 I'm getting a lot of TypeError: $target.offset(...) is undefined when clicking on the nav.
[16:48:03] <ryanneufeld> tw2113: did we have em?
[16:48:07] <tw2113> yep
[16:48:10] <ryanneufeld> neat
[16:48:20] <ryanneufeld> I won't be there for much longer
[16:48:42] <DAGr8> the nav ?
[16:48:49] <DAGr8> its all css ..
[16:48:55] <duch_kazatel> DAGr8 huh?
[16:49:05] <tw2113> found greener pastures?
[16:49:05] <DAGr8> removed the hover thingy
[16:49:07] <Fernandos> DAGr8: that code I wrote is letting you smooth scroll the cheap way.
[16:49:15] <DAGr8> ok
[16:49:31] <DAGr8> im sure somehting is wrong here on my end that code works on other websites
[16:49:47] <duch_kazatel> DAGr8 I assume the issue is that when you click on a thing in the header (like under "juliet") you expect it to scroll?
[16:50:57] <DAGr8> no
[16:51:04] <DAGr8> in rgw gallery click on positive red
[16:51:10] <DAGr8> or on g26
[16:51:17] <DAGr8> on firefox
[16:51:24] <DAGr8> it scrolls nicely formone to another
[16:51:39] <DAGr8> from one to *
[16:51:41] <duch_kazatel> ah there we go.
[16:51:47] <DAGr8> on chrome it doesnt
[16:51:56] <DAGr8> it shoudl
[16:52:16] <DAGr8> im also having other issues
[16:52:25] <DAGr8> with my back to top plugin
[16:52:30] <DAGr8> the arrow never appears
[16:52:38] <duch_kazatel> fyi you only need 1 document ready.
[16:53:00] <duch_kazatel> remove all the document ready wraps and put all your code in one of these: $(function(){ /* Your code here */}):
[16:53:03] <DAGr8> so your saying the one in contact form and then remove the others ?
[16:53:20] <DAGr8> on it
[16:53:45] <duch_kazatel> and the reason the smoothscroll is broken in chrome is becauase updating the hash causes the browser jumps to that ID on the page.
[16:54:21] <duch_kazatel> you have to prevent the default event action or approach things a little differently.
[16:54:49] <DAGr8> the reason i removed prevent default
[16:54:59] <DAGr8> is that it wouldnt go there at all with it
[16:55:18] <DAGr8> like it was preventing default but not running the previous oen
[16:55:21] <DAGr8> ill add it back tho
[16:56:04] <duch_kazatel> your code is all kinds of broken for the scroll.  one sec let me refactor.
[17:01:43] <duch_kazatel> woah.  weird.
[17:01:45] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[17:02:36] <DAGr8> heeh
[17:02:48] <DAGr8> this shoudl be easy i dotn get why its not working did lots of googling
[17:02:53] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:02:58] <DAGr8> im also using another plugin 'goup'
[17:03:01] <duch_kazatel> the way you did it is not the way I would have done it.
[17:03:16] <DAGr8> it aint workign wither
[17:03:35] <DAGr8> either*
[17:04:33] <DAGr8> Fernandos
[17:04:40] <DAGr8> what am i missing for yoru code
[17:04:41] <DAGr8> ..
[17:04:48] <DAGr8> still aint wokring
[17:04:54] <duch_kazatel> DAGr8 something about your page is broken.
[17:05:03] <duch_kazatel> you aren't like repeating IDs are you?
[17:05:04] <Fernandos> DAGr8: yes? Just got back. What are you trying?
[17:05:12] <DAGr8> i tried yoru code
[17:05:27] <DAGr8> ran it thru w3c
[17:05:30] <DAGr8> it says its fine
[17:05:36] <Fernandos> do you understand how it works?
[17:06:05] <DAGr8> myID
[17:06:17] <DAGr8> well at first i thought i neede to change that
[17:06:22] <Fernandos> yes you need to
[17:06:23] <DAGr8> but this makes no sense
[17:06:48] <DAGr8> so it means i have to put that for every links illhave on that page
[17:06:50] <DAGr8> ?
[17:07:12] <duch_kazatel> DAGr8 you can also create a function and pass it the thing you clicked on.
[17:07:32] <Fernandos> yeah. I used it as a way to "scrollToTop", which isn't used multiple times per page.
[17:07:41] <DAGr8> ok
[17:07:47] <DAGr8> then that wont work for me
[17:07:53] <Fernandos> as duch_kazatel I initially recommended to wrap that into a function, it should be easy.
[17:07:55] <DAGr8> speaking of scroll to top
[17:07:59] <DAGr8> im using 'goup'
[17:08:01] <DAGr8> plugin
[17:08:12] <duch_kazatel> DAGr8 are you just googling for pluins and snippets that do what you want?
[17:08:39] <DAGr8> yes im not using templates im just trying to add stuff as i go to my web page and understand all im doing ..
[17:08:56] <duch_kazatel> you should really try learning, then.
[17:09:11] <DAGr8> thats what im fdoing
[17:09:14] <DAGr8> isnt it ?
[17:09:16] <Fernandos> DAGr8: just give up googling for a moment and stick to the code and try coming up with your own one. It will make you much better than you believe.
[17:09:27] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[17:09:30] <DAGr8> ok
[17:09:42] <duch_kazatel> think about how you'd abstract out that scrolling code to a function.
[17:10:02] <duch_kazatel> and how you'd pass the current clicked "thing" to it.
[17:10:18] <Fernandos> honestly, there are lots of plugins that really look great visually, but their code sucks hard. You better become a plug-in writer yourself, than becoming a plug-in consumer.
[17:10:30] <DAGr8> i hear ya
[17:10:56] <DAGr8> and i have bunch of jquery tutorials here and i thought id get into this , just wanted to have basic things working
[17:10:57] <DAGr8> lol
[17:11:15] <duch_kazatel> step away from the tutorials and start writing code.
[17:11:57] <DAGr8> ok
[17:12:37] <Fernandos> DAGr8: I fully support duch_kazatel on this one! You learn much much more from either forking and extending a library or plug-in, than from a tutorial. But first you have to write your own stuff.
[17:12:58] <duch_kazatel> OR! don't use plugins unless you really need them.
[17:13:12] <DAGr8> i hear ya
[17:13:27] <DAGr8> what i dont understand is why i can run a whole template on my site and these things will work
[17:13:36] <DAGr8> and then i try just the snippets on mine and it wont
[17:13:55] <Fernandos> DAGr8: you can actually create all of the effects on your website with css3 only
[17:14:21] <DAGr8> yup
[17:14:27] <DAGr8> i got no js runing on it atm
[17:14:33] <duch_kazatel> DAGr8...
[17:14:33] <DAGr8> other then the contact form
[17:14:34] <duch_kazatel> what?
[17:14:39] <duch_kazatel> you have a scripts file.
[17:14:41] <Fernandos> DAGr8: transition, translate, key-frames are the key to that
[17:14:47] <duch_kazatel> and you're trying to use it right now.
[17:14:47] <DAGr8> yes
[17:14:57] <DAGr8> thats where im at
[17:14:58] <DAGr8> lol
[17:15:00] <duch_kazatel> ok
[17:15:20] <DAGr8> a few days ago i decided i woudl add this and start undertanding it
[17:15:31] <DAGr8> and realize i couldnt even load a few basic line of code
[17:16:00] <DAGr8> so either as you said
[17:16:04] <DAGr8> somethign is broken in my page
[17:17:56] <DAGr8> Fernandos
[17:18:02] <DAGr8> yoru code shoud work now
[17:18:04] <DAGr8> and it still doesnt
[17:19:31] <Fernandos> works for me
[17:20:16] <Fernandos> maybe a chrome/firefox addon interfering on your side, or you're on localhost accidentally :P
[17:20:34] <duch_kazatel> localhost shouldn't make a difference in his case.
[17:20:42] <duch_kazatel> that only matters if you're running ajax, etc.
[17:21:09] <DAGr8> i have 0 add ons on chrome
[17:21:22] <DAGr8> click n my site if it works for you then it means its my browser
[17:21:27] <DAGr8> and it woudl make me very happy
[17:21:28] <DAGr8> lol
[17:22:01] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: happened to me quite a few times, that I edited a file in the wrong folder. hehe
[17:22:10] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos hah
[17:22:14] <Fernandos> ftp being mounted, you know..
[17:22:24] <duch_kazatel> I don't do that tbh.
[17:22:46] <DAGr8> http://www.renocustom.com/gallery.html#red
[17:22:53] <DAGr8> click onthe g26
[17:23:00] <DAGr8> the first on on the left
[17:23:13] <Fernandos> it scrolls down
[17:23:22] <duch_kazatel> mine jumps, doesn't scroll
[17:23:31] <DAGr8> lmao
[17:23:39] <DAGr8> ok we are getting somewhere
[17:23:47] <DAGr8> you are both using chrome ?
[17:23:51] <duch_kazatel> Firefox.
[17:23:58] <Fernandos> also firefox
[17:24:03] <DAGr8> i didnt try on ff yet
[17:24:06] <duch_kazatel> you're making this really complicated.
[17:24:11] <Fernandos> v27.0
[17:25:05] <DAGr8> yea im v27 here and latest chrome to
[17:25:10] <DAGr8> doent scroll on either
[17:25:14] <DAGr8> but you say it does for ya
[17:25:18] <Fernandos> yep
[17:25:40] <DAGr8> very weird
[17:25:46] <Fernandos> DAGr8: not really.
[17:25:51] <DAGr8> how about my scroll back to top does it work for you ?
[17:26:01] <duch_kazatel> you're not preventing the default event again.
[17:26:12] <duch_kazatel> DAGr8 you're writing lots of very... specific code.
[17:26:13] <Fernandos> DAGr8: you've errors in script.js so you better comment the irrelevant part out first
[17:27:11] <duch_kazatel> also DAGr8 f very... specific code.
[17:27:11] <duch_kazatel> [2014:03:03:17:26:13] <Fernandos> DAGr8: you've errors in script
[17:27:13] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[17:27:14] <DAGr8> duch_kazatel return false shodul do similar thing as prevent defautl
[17:27:18] <duch_kazatel> $('#scrollTo a[href]$="g26"') - that doesn't work
[17:27:50] <freebirD2> you guys, I would like to make the table,  EditTable , able to scroll down when needed ? can't do it, the source code can be viewed in here: http://tny.cz/32e7c597
[17:29:03] <Fernandos> DAGr8: also there is an Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #scrollTo a[href]$="g26"
[17:29:16] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos I just pointed that out :)
[17:29:44] <Fernandos> oh, sorry, didn't see that :) Jumping between code and chat here..
[17:31:07] <DAGr8> we;lli copy pasted yoru code Fernandos
[17:31:10] <DAGr8> $('#scrollTo a[href]$="myID"').click(function() {         $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop:0 }, '2000');         return false;     });
[17:31:17] <duch_kazatel> DAGr8 what about that code looks wrong?
[17:31:24] <duch_kazatel> DAGr8 does that not look... strange to you?
[17:31:57] <duch_kazatel> try something like this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/m4HCa/1/
[17:32:39] <DAGr8> to many quotes i suppose
[17:32:39] <DAGr8> heh
[17:32:51] <Fernandos> DAGr8: it was meant as an example I extracted that out of some old code as I said =)
[17:33:22] <duch_kazatel> i always abstract my IDs from the hrefs
[17:33:24] <Fernandos> the example duch_kazatel provided is more complete and cleaner
[17:33:37] <duch_kazatel> so i don't have to worry about the page jumping.
[17:36:57] <DAGr8> yes
[17:37:04] <DAGr8> but still not working here
[17:38:21] <DAGr8> it does work on firefox
[17:38:23] <DAGr8> but not on chrome
[17:38:24] <DAGr8> ,,
[17:38:36] <DAGr8> same problem i had before
[17:38:55] <DAGr8> ill try on another computer
[17:41:38] <duch_kazatel> could you console.log(topOffset) after I set it and make sure it has a value?
[17:43:46] <Fernandos> DAGr8: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined scripts.js:67body.scrollTop is deprecated in strict mode. Please use 'documentElement.scrollTop' if in strict mode and 'body.scrollTop' only if in quirks mode.
[17:44:09] <Fernandos> DAGr8: you should check the chrome inspector's console, if you haven't already.
[17:46:19] <Fernandos> DAGr8: replace the html,body in the selector with html like this $('html').animate({ scrollTop: topOffset }, '2000');
[17:54:28] <Fernandos> DAGr8: this works. http://jsbin.com/yaxojuxe/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[18:01:50] <DAGr8> ah
[18:01:54] <DAGr8> thx alot Fernandos
[18:03:33] <nicladas> Hi everyone, quick question, does anyone know if there is a way to have notifications pop up any any page on an event that happens server side with jquery?
[18:04:29] <nicladas> Say if someone submits a request that runs through AJAX and take awhile, and they go to another page
[18:05:36] <hugo_moss> something like stack overflow's post notifications?
[18:06:49] <nicladas> I'm not familiar with that sorry. I can look out up real quick though
[18:07:22] <nicladas> I mean I know SO.. just not the notification part :-)
[18:10:11] <nicladas> hugo_moss, that system could work actually, I could just run a set timeout every few seconds and check a database table
[18:12:00] <nicladas> Is there any way to do it so I don't have to constantly be running it ppb an interval though and just call an event when triggered?
[18:12:52] <nicladas> Ppb = on
[18:14:15] <DAGr8> ok Fernandos
[18:14:22] <DAGr8> it works perfect in ff
[18:14:24] <DAGr8> but not in chrome
[18:14:47] <Fernandos> DAGr8: works in both here
[18:15:12] <DAGr8> yup
[18:15:18] <DAGr8> im sure somethign is wrong with my chrome
[18:15:35] <DAGr8> because right now here on chrome
[18:15:40] <DAGr8> it wont even jump to the link
[18:15:56] <DAGr8> this is why i had the prevent default remove din hte first place
[18:18:14] <DAGr8> im uninstalling it rebooting be back in a sec
[18:25:36] <DAGr8> well fresh install of chrome still not working
[18:59:25] <TiMike> hi,  I am looping through some json using $.each, and as I am appending elements to the dom, is seems sorta slow.. is there an optimized way to do this?
[19:00:00] <systemfault> TiMike: build a string and append only once at the end.
[19:00:50] <TiMike> systemfault cool, will try. thanks
[19:02:18] <luvmyh0nda> I find a lot of information on this, but what is the correct way to select a UI Tab? (my tabs are dynamically added)
[19:02:37] <luvmyh0nda> is it active, or select?
[19:06:46] <shoky> luvmyh0nda: depends which version of UI. on the latest it's the active option
[19:07:28] <luvmyh0nda> "option","active",index
[19:07:42] <shoky> ?
[19:07:57] <luvmyh0nda> tabs('option','active',tabIndex)
[19:08:03] <luvmyh0nda> eg 1,2, etc
[19:08:27] <shoky> ok
[19:10:03] <luvmyh0nda> will active open a tab w/ a URL loaded via AJAX?
[19:11:20] <shoky> any tab
[19:11:35] <luvmyh0nda> even if the tab hasn't yet been loaded?
[19:11:55] <luvmyh0nda> for some reason, when i programmatically add a tab, it doesn't focus
[19:12:05] <TiMike> systemfault: should i initialize a variable, then use .append() ?
[19:12:51] <shoky> luvmyh0nda: are you calling .tabs('refresh') after adding your tabs
[19:13:10] <systemfault> TiMike: What's really slow are "repaints", everytime you add/remove/modifiy something on the page, you "force" the browser to rerender parts/all the page. You need to avoid as many repaints as possible.
[19:13:26] <luvmyh0nda> yes
[19:13:56] <systemfault> TiMike: So instead of appending in the each, you should declare a variable, append markup to it... then after the $.each, append it to the destination
[19:14:01] <systemfault> TiMike: If possible.
[19:14:18] <systemfault> TiMike: That way, only one repaint is triggered... the final append.
[19:15:55] <TiMike> systemfault  right, so initialize the variable.  the part i am not sure about is when in the loop, what is the syntax?
[19:16:18] <TiMike> right now i have: $('nav').append(a); as the last call
[19:16:58] <TiMike> should i do like:    the_string.append(a) ?
[19:17:20] <systemfault> var markup = '' $.each(myArray, function() { markup += '<div>' + this + '</div>'; }) myContainer.append(markup);
[19:17:46] <systemfault> var markup = ''; $.each(myArray, function() { markup += '<div>' + this + '</div>'; }); myContainer.append(markup); // forgot some semi-colons
[19:18:04] <luvmyh0nda> hmmm
[19:18:15] <luvmyh0nda> i believe it has something to do w/ not refreshing the tabs after i remove a tab programmatically
[19:18:17] <luvmyh0nda> will update in a few.
[19:19:53] <shoky> luvmyh0nda ya it's working fine here  http://jsfiddle.net/mp7dr/
[19:26:24] <luvmyh0nda> ok, this is really strange
[19:26:55] <luvmyh0nda> nevermind. i was going to say it works perfectly w/ IE's profiler on
[19:32:54] <TiMike> systemfault: I got it going, but my string seems to be all text, my string is html markup
[19:33:21] <TiMike> systemfault: how do i print it as markup
[19:33:52] <systemfault> TiMike: You shouldn't have to do anything special, jQuery doesn't escape anything AFAIk
[19:34:28] <TiMike> systemfault: hrm, its printing out text
[19:36:06] <shoky> your string is html and you want to print it as html?  then use .text
[19:39:20] <TiMike> shoky: ok, trying thx
[19:41:01] <shoky> why would you want html markup to appear in a <nav> though?
[19:43:45] <TiMike> shoky: i am building a bunch of links
[19:44:10] <TiMike> shoky: i want to append them all efficiently as possible
[19:44:18] <shoky> usually i want links to appear as text, not as html...
[19:44:38] <shoky> e.g. i dont want to see   <a href=...>    when viewing the page
[19:44:47] <TiMike> but i am building the link element
[19:45:01] <shoky> yes..
[19:45:11] <shoky> but you want it to appear as... text, right..
[19:45:11] <TiMike> then i am appending
[19:45:19] <TiMike> no
[19:45:22] <shoky> :\
[19:45:29] <shoky> you want your site to show <a> ?
[19:45:33] <TiMike> its am image with a link
[19:45:43] <shoky> you want your site to show <img>  instead of an actual image?
[19:46:00] <shoky> anyway. so you don't want .text
[19:46:05] <TiMike> ok
[19:46:12] <shoky> .append should be fine
[19:46:13] <TiMike> so i a looping thru data
[19:46:27] <TiMike> i am building an a element
[19:46:35] <TiMike> i know how to do this
[19:46:38] <TiMike> but
[19:46:50] <TiMike> my orig question was it seemed slow
[19:47:00] <TiMike> was looking for a more efficient way
[19:47:12] <shoky> i know
[19:47:16] <TiMike> oh ok
[19:47:33] <shoky> and then you asked "how do i print it as markup"
[19:47:38] <TiMike> systemfault suggested building a string
[19:47:41] <shoky> so i was answering that.. but it turned out thats not what you want
[19:47:56] <TiMike> sorry if i misspoke
[19:48:09] <shoky> no worries
[19:48:41] <TiMike> can i make  a string, append the a elements, then print it out all at once at the end?
[19:48:44] <shoky> make a jsfiddle if you're still having problems
[19:48:53] <shoky> no idea what you mean by that
[19:48:59] <shoky> "print it all out"
[19:49:29] <TiMike> "print it all out"   - append the list lof a href elements to the page
[19:49:34] <shoky> yes.
[19:49:52] <TiMike> ok, so how :)
[19:50:44] <shoky> var s = '<a href.....>..</a>';    s += '<a href=..>..</a>';  ....;   $('#container').append(s);
[19:50:59] <shoky> as a gross simple example.
[19:51:17] <TiMike> shoky: lemme try
[19:51:35] <shoky> come back with a fiddle ;p
[19:51:38] <Velveeta> wat
[19:52:08] <shoky> what's the trouble there, sir
[19:53:50] <Velveeta> no trouble here, sir! move it along, now!
[19:54:10] <shoky> hi-ho
[20:05:31] <docmur> I have this code:  http://jsfiddle.net/xa2QG/2/  what i want is to disable the "submit" button when nothing is in the title / textarea and if something is in both of them enable it, I can't figure this out
[20:08:58] <checkit> Hello all. I'm building a simple on page filter function but I'm having some trouble with matches. If I use indexOf or search I'm only getting results where the query matches the first few characters. how can i return results where a match is found anywhere within a string?
[20:12:36] <TiMike> shoky: systemfault: got it thanks for your help
[20:12:56] <systemfault> TiMike: Got it working&
[20:12:57] <systemfault> ?
[20:13:03] <TiMike> yes
[20:13:07] <systemfault> Great!
[20:13:09] <TiMike> much faster
[20:13:20] <TiMike> much appreciated!
[20:13:21] <systemfault> Yeah... repaints are really slow
[20:13:27] <TiMike> yep
[20:19:05] <Velveeta> docmur: try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/xa2QG/5/
[20:19:36] <Velveeta> er, this one, minus the console.log statements :D http://jsfiddle.net/xa2QG/6/
[20:20:57] <Velveeta> you also don't need the ui-state-disabled classes on those, the disabled property will automatically make the buttons appear disabled just by native browser styling, unless you're specificallyw anting to apply some additional styles based on the ui-state-disabled class
[20:21:14] <docmur> wow thanks
[20:21:48] <boyz13vinz> Just saying http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/transitions/ is not correct.
[20:22:41] <boyz13vinz> Hope somebody from the JQuery foundation team can fix this.
[20:23:35] <Velveeta> you should report that to them in the #jquerymobile-dev channel
[20:23:58] <boyz13vinz> Okay, thanks! :)

[20:50:59] <Tinku> Hello Guys can anyone help me with dynamically resizing the iframe with src hosted in different domain
[20:54:44] <systemfault> I don't even think it's possible..
[20:56:21] <Tinku> why is that.... could you explain little bit
[20:59:13] <systemfault> systemfault: Because of cross-domain policy..
[20:59:18] <systemfault> err.. Tinku
[20:59:54] <systemfault> If you have an iframe with a src that is on a different domain, it's like a sandbox, you cannot read from it
[21:00:25] <systemfault> Just imagine the security issues if the browser would let you do that.
[21:01:47] <Tinku> Okay I understand....
[21:10:20] <mlee> Tinku you could try this: https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer

[21:30:08] <Carraway> when I cache a jquery selector, e.g. $body - is there anyway to make it read-only?
[21:30:26] <Carraway> so like say I want to remember $body exactly as it was when the page was loaded, despite the DOM changing
[21:30:38] <luvmyh0nda> save it to another var?
[21:30:55] <luvmyh0nda> either way i'm pretty sure they can be changed
[21:31:27] <Carraway> I think even if I pass it to another var, if $('body') changes, the new var value would change along with $('body')
[21:31:29] <grizly_> Carraway: var body_start = jQuery('body').html(); //or something?
[21:31:46] <Carraway> ooh - yes, that could work
[21:31:47] <luvmyh0nda> Carraway: it shouldn't
[21:31:48] <Carraway> thanks grizly_
[21:31:57] <Carraway> luvmyh0nda, I'm going to try both ideas
[21:32:00] <Carraway> I'll be back :)
[21:39:57] <sv> hi
[22:12:14] <cadz> hi anyone here?
[22:12:55] <cadz> anyone knows if this jquery plugin can be used in jquery version 1.4.2? please tell me
[22:12:57] <cadz> http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[22:14:08] <grizly_> nope, Min is 1.6+
[22:16:03] <cadz> grizly_: but can it sill be used just for the sake of uploading multiple files? without the fancy effects? sorry correct me if im wrong but i think version is for the fancy effects?
[22:16:33] <grizly_> It does say "Mandatory requirements".. I didn't dig any deeper than the readme
[22:16:56] <cadz> grizly_: thanks sir
[22:17:34] <grizly_> with no-conflict, you can run multiple jqueries simultaneously
[22:17:57] <cadz> grizly_: i dont get what you mean? please elaborate sir
[22:17:59] <systemfault> That's what happens when you let your frontend rot
[22:18:02] <grizly_> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[22:18:15] <systemfault> 1.4.2... really :(
[22:18:53] <grizly_> jah, I have a drupal issue that won't let me rise higher than 1.4.4.. is frustrating.. but it literally breaks JSON if I try and go higher!.. so I feel your pain
[22:19:36] <cadz> grizly_: how does thi no conflict can help my vesion problem sir?
[22:19:58] <grizly_> you can load another version, assign it to another variable, and use that for the newer code.
[22:21:45] <grizly_> cadz: http://jsfiddle.net/V9kWb/
[22:23:00] <cadz> grizly_: so instead of '$'. I have to use jq110.('#somethingLIKE-this?')
[22:23:20] <grizly_> well, yeah, but the $ will still work, it will just refer to the 1.4.4 version
[22:23:39] <cadz> grizly_: you sir are very brilliant. Thanks a lot
[22:23:45] <grizly_> you can call that variable whatever you like

[22:37:00] <tw2113> what did i do to you systemfault :P
[22:37:29] <systemfault> tw2113: This is the problem, you never do anything to me.
[22:37:40] <tw2113> that is a problem >:)
[22:37:50] <systemfault> tw2113: You never think about my feelings
[22:40:50] <jl2753> Hey guys- hoping someone can give me a hint. http://dpaste.com/1685051/
[22:41:05] <jl2753> im using a .load() example but sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt
[22:41:18] <jl2753> I think it might be because the previous ajax call isn't completed yet, but not sure what to do
[22:41:35] <jl2753> I've tried .ajaxStop(), and .complete() but I think i have the syntax wrong
[22:42:11] <cadz> am i doing this right? I went to the jquery.com/download then I copied their uncompressed version, saved it as jquery.some.version.js then included it in my site? is that right?
[22:42:18] <systemfault> jl2753: Your loadContent function is very strange.
[22:42:44] <luvmyh0nda> yeah
[22:42:46] <luvmyh0nda> i would do ajax()
[22:42:49] <luvmyh0nda> with a success:
[22:43:32] <systemfault> jl2753: Do you really need that ajaxStop thing?
[22:43:42] <cadz> am i doing this right? I went to the jquery.com/download then I copied their uncompressed version, saved it as jquery.some.version.js then included it in my site? is that right?
[22:43:56] <luvmyh0nda> cadz: should be
[22:44:03] <luvmyh0nda> assuming you have the URL/path correct
[22:44:08] <luvmyh0nda> you can also use the CDN
[22:44:11] <cadz> luvmyh0nda: thanks
[22:44:13] <systemfault> cadz: Sure, you might want to switch to the compressed version in production though
[22:44:24] <cadz> systemfault: thanks a lot sir
[22:44:29] <jl2753> systemfault: yeah, I followed this link: http://davidgoss.co.uk/2011/08/06/ajax-paging-with-jquery-and-the-history-api/
[22:44:52] <jl2753> i'd like to keep the .load instead of using a standard ajax call if possible just because everything's already done using that method
[22:45:00] <jl2753> I wish I knew better earlier
[22:45:13] <luvmyh0nda> jl2753: let me show you a quick something
[22:45:40] <jl2753> luvmyh0nda: sure
[22:47:10] <cadz> grizly_: I have followed what you said, I loaded my old version of jquery, then next loaded a jquery version 1.6.4, then put var jq6 = noConflict(); , but still it has error
[22:47:59] <luvmyh0nda> jl2753: http://jsfiddle.net/MAR7M/
[22:48:00] <cadz> grizly_: when i try to use the .fileupload function, which is supported only to jquery version 1.6+, it says in console, fileupload is not a function
[22:48:25] <luvmyh0nda> actually 2 secs
[22:48:50] <luvmyh0nda> http://jsfiddle.net/MAR7M/1/
[23:01:49] <jl2753> luvmyh0nda: okay, I tried to break it down. Could you take a quick look and see if my comments are right? http://jsfiddle.net/MAR7M/3/
[23:03:04] <jl2753> how would i specify what data to load? let's say that I'm trying to replace $('#somelement').html() with $('#newpageelement').html(), how would I do that?
[23:04:17] <slax0r> $("#somelement").html($("#newpageelement").html());
[23:07:54] <luvmyh0nda> yes
[23:08:11] <luvmyh0nda> $('#somelement').html($('#newpageelement').html())
[23:08:40] <luvmyh0nda> but, in this case, your ajax call would load $('#newpageelement').html() into data
[23:08:49] <luvmyh0nda> OR
[23:09:34] <luvmyh0nda> if you're trying to remove #somelement, you can do $('#someelement').parent().append($('#newpageelement').html()); $('#somelement').remove();
[23:16:40] <jl2753> and if i'm replacing the $('#someelement') on existing page with $('#someelement') on requested page, $('#somelement').html(data) would do exactly that right?
[23:17:31] <luvmyh0nda> not quite
[23:17:37] <luvmyh0nda> load data into a hidden element, and then traverse
[23:18:14] <luvmyh0nda> success: function(data) { $('#hiddenel').html(data); $('#someelement').html($('#hiddenel #traversed_element').html()); }
[23:20:43] <jl2753> makes perfect sense. i'll give it a try. thank you!
[23:20:49] <luvmyh0nda> no prob :)
[23:23:21] <Cork> jl2753: there is another more compact option
[23:23:45] <Cork> $('#someelement-parent').load('url #someelement')
[23:24:03] <Cork> though you need an additional element to do it that way
[23:24:47] <Cork> luvmyh0nda: also $('#hiddenel').html(data); $('#someelement').html($('#hiddenel #traversed_element').html()); is way overcomplicated
[23:25:25] <luvmyh0nda> Cork: How would you handle the preloader? And/Or can you find w/in data?
[23:25:41] <Cork> $(data).find('#someelement').replace('#someelement');
[23:26:04] <Cork> let me just check so you can write replace in that form
[23:26:07] <jl2753> Cork: yeah i did that previously as it was in an example script I found, but I kept having problems with that
[23:26:14] <jl2753> because the ajax worked once in a while
[23:26:28] <jl2753> i suspected that the previous ajax call wasn't complete yet and .ajaxStop wouldn't work
[23:26:30] <Cork> luvmyh0nda: $(data).find('#someelement').replaceAll('#someelement');
[23:27:06] <Cork> jl2753: though i do recommend sending partials from the server instead
[23:27:15] <luvmyh0nda> that's how i'd do it
[23:27:17] <Cork> jl2753: the .load thing is really just a hack
[23:27:24] <luvmyh0nda> .load wasn't working prev.
[23:27:30] <luvmyh0nda> so i kinda did a fallback to something that worked
[23:37:29] <cadz> guys can you check this out, https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin I need to ask a question about the javascript part.
[23:37:44] <Cork> cadz: ask the question first
[23:37:48] <cadz> first question: where did the .result came from? in data.result.files?
[23:37:50] <Cork> so ppl know if they can help
[23:38:18] <Cork> cadz: data is what the plugin returns to you
[23:38:56] <Cork> in this case it is an object { result: { files: [{ name: "" }] } }
[23:39:19] <Cork> so the result comes from the fileupload plugin
[23:39:34] <cadz> Cork: okay makes sense sir, second question, what is the use of the letter 'e'?
[23:39:58] <Cork> e most of the time stands for event
[23:40:06] <Cork> in some cases it stands for element
[23:40:17] <Cork> you would have to check the api doc for fielupload to know
[23:40:22] <cadz> Cork: can i omit it?
[23:40:37] <Cork> not if you want data
[23:41:08] <Cork> well technically you could use arguments to access it
[23:41:13] <Cork> but... lets not go there :)
[23:41:13] <cadz> Cork: but i have many jquery here, which i made myself, it doesnt have any letter 'e' but i get the return of it
[23:41:51] <Cork> cadz: not sure why that would have anything to do with this
[23:42:11] <Cork> what arguments a plugin passes to it's callbacks is up to them
[23:42:28] <Cork> and you can name the "e" what ever you like
[23:42:53] <Cork> (e, data) just means "name the first argument "e" and the second one "data"
[23:42:58] <cadz> Cork: i am just confused because it is passing the letter 'e' but it is not using that variable inside
[23:43:11] <Cork> if you remove e you get: name the first argument data
[23:43:22] <Cork> cadz: it isn't passing the letter
[23:43:27] <Cork> it is passing data
[23:43:29] <Cork> you name it
[23:43:54] <cadz> Cork: okay, im confused than before i asked. lol
[23:44:00] <Cork> done: function(jolly, roger) {}
[23:44:09] <Cork> jolly would be the first argument
[23:44:15] <Cork> and roger the file data
[23:44:27] <Cork> kinda bad names for the content, but totally valid
[23:44:30] <cadz> Cork: yes, so what is jolly for? how can i use it?
[23:44:46] <Cork> cadz: you would have to read the fileupload plugins api docs
[23:45:03] <cadz> Cork: ohhh, i thought it is some js standard
[23:45:15] <cadz> Cork: because i see it most of the time
[23:45:25] <Cork> cadz: lets back this out a little bit
[23:45:27] <cadz> Cork: Thanks a lot sir
[23:45:46] <Cork> $().fileupload({ done: function(a,b) {} })
[23:46:10] <Cork> what this does is define an anonymous function (noname) that has two named arguments
[23:46:28] <Cork> and sends that function as a value for done in the object passed to the function
[23:46:31] <cadz> Cork: yes i follow that
[23:47:17] <Cork> what fileupload does is something like function fileupload(options) { /* some code */ options.done(data_gathered1, data_gathered2); }
[23:47:31] <Cork> there is nothing defined in what things are there
[23:47:43] <Cork> just the order of the values the function passes things on
[23:47:53] <Cork> cadz: this is true for ALL callbacks
[23:48:09] <Cork> there is no javascript defined standards here
[23:48:26] <Cork> there are conventions in practice
[23:48:44] <Cork> but nothing the engines care about
[23:49:03] <cadz> Cork: Thanks, ahhh yes, convention is the right term for it. Thanks a lot. Ill be back for more question on this fileupload thingy. lol
