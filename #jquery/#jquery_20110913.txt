[00:03:30] <ispirto> how can I put val() of each inputs, checkboxes, selects, textareas with a json data?
[00:05:58] <wreel> ispirto: is this for a manual form submission with ajax?
[00:06:25] <ispirto> wreel, is it for to change the value="" of each input by the json data
[00:07:20] <ispirto> it is*
[00:07:43] <wreel> ah. well i don't know any clever way but i'm a noob. i'd just manually find those elements and set their values according to the json data
[00:08:04] <ispirto> wreel, this worked: $("#step1 :input");
[00:10:10] <Umren> how to set timeouts on actions? example: edited css property, and in 1 second want to turn it back
[00:10:36] <angelkoilov> Umren:  callback
[00:11:58] <bitwise_> how would i check out a stable version of jquery if i clone the github repo?
[00:12:51] <gf3> bitwise_: switch to one of the tags
[00:13:30] <gf3> git checkout 1.4.3
[00:14:07] <bitwise_> coolm thx
[00:14:48] <Umren> angelkoilov: is it working with css .. ?
[00:15:06] <bitwise_> bahh..my code is stil broken
[00:21:39] <angelkoilov> Umren: just callback a function to revert changes
[00:24:00] <Jonathan_Dum> Anyone know an easy way to .is() on a set of elements, but AND the result instead of OR-ing it?
[00:26:35] <xertion> Hi guys, I'm doing a very important assignement including jQuery and I'm done with the functionality. Could someone please glance through the code and tell me if you feel anything looks weird or give any feedback? The short script is here: http://pastebin.com/8KGrnSX1 (Only 56 rows)
[00:28:18] <coldhead> xertion: $('#cityList:not(":contains('
[00:28:26] <coldhead> that makes me worry you have multiple elements with the same ID
[00:28:29] <coldhead> i hope you don't
[00:28:42] <coldhead> $('form').submit(function(){ should be more specific
[00:28:56] <coldhead> you could easily have more than 1 form on the page
[00:29:12] <xertion> coldhead: I dont have any elements with the same ID, Why does that line worry you about that?
[00:30:04] <coldhead> ID is usually binary, either you it does exist or it doesn't
[00:30:20] <xertion> #cityList is a list of cities, so I want to make sure that the list do NOT contain the current City.
[00:30:20] <coldhead> but hey i'm trying to nitpick
[00:30:28] <coldhead> if it's fine by you, let's get on with our lives
[00:30:40] <xertion> coldhead: No im not taking any offense, I appreciate it a lot.
[00:30:45] <xertion> Im just asking to learn.
[00:30:46] <coldhead> it all looks fine to me
[00:31:13] <coldhead> you use the var keyword appropriately, there are comments
[00:31:19] <coldhead> nothing inefficient is going on
[00:31:24] <coldhead> thumbs u[
[00:31:26] <coldhead> up*
[00:31:41] <xertion> thanks mate. nice of u to glance through it.
[00:35:41] <drcode> hi all
[00:36:41] <ispirto> how can i submit a form by jquery?
[00:36:51] <ispirto> i type $('#form').submit(); but not workng
[00:37:07] <drcode> hi all
[00:37:27] <drcode> I am trying to use some chat code in jquery and change his style
[00:37:40] <drcode> I will be glad if someone can help me with jquery code
[00:37:46] <xertion> ispirto: Make sure you have return false for the submit-event. This way the Page does not refresh
[00:38:07] <ispirto> xertion, i want the page refresh :)
[00:38:37] <ispirto> i have prevent default function before the validation, then i want it to be submitted
[00:38:55] <xertion> ispirto: should it be a #form then? and not $('form') ?
[00:40:54] <ispirto> xertion, this worked, document.forms["step1"].submit();
[00:41:00] <ispirto> instead using jquery
[00:42:53] <wreel> Jonathan_Dun: how about using Array.every() with your predicate?
[00:46:21] <ispirto> one last thing, i have these kinds of checkboxes: <input type="checkbox" name="advertise[]" value="2" />, i want to make them checked with json data, how can i do it?
[00:46:46] <ray73864> so i've got a tough one here (well i think it is), i have this: http://jsfiddle.net/B27nT/
[00:47:12] <ray73864> i need to make all of 'customer 1' one colour, all of 'customer 2' another colour, and then all of customer 3 the same colour as number 1
[00:47:28] <ray73864> so a sort of zebra striping, but each customer might have a different number of rows on the screen
[00:50:19] <coldhead> ray73864: this problem is best solved on the serverside, by giving appropriate classes to each customer's rows
[00:50:40] <ray73864> ahh ok
[00:50:54] <ray73864> i can do it server side easilly enough, was just thinking maybe there was a way to do it clientside too
[00:51:35] <coldhead> not in this case
[00:51:43] <ray73864> k
[00:51:45] <coldhead> it's something the serverside should know perfectly well
[00:51:52] <coldhead> and to ask the client to work it out again
[00:51:54] <coldhead> and regroup them
[00:52:02] <coldhead> is just a lot of trouble for no good reason
[00:59:20] <g0rd0n> is there a way with jquery (or javascript)
[00:59:49] <g0rd0n> to format a time given as HH:MM:SS as HH:MM e.g. leaving out the seconds?
[01:00:51] <coldhead> ?eval 'HH:MM:SS'.replace(/:[^:]*/, '')
[01:00:51] <simonleojung> ray: http://jsfiddle.net/simonjung/B27nT/1/
[01:00:53] <bot-t> coldhead: "HH:SS"
[01:00:55] <simonleojung> like that?
[01:01:06] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[01:01:07] * bot-t sighs
[01:02:07] <simonleojung> lol guess i did that for nothing :(
[01:02:40] <simonleojung> but I do agree with coldhead since it makes more sense to make classes
[01:03:00] <coldhead> simonleojung: you've earned our admiration
[01:03:04] <coldhead> and respect
[01:03:07] <coldhead> good job
[01:03:46] <simonleojung> :) i think
[01:03:49] <simonleojung> lol
[01:03:56] <simonleojung> hard to tell any sarcasm online :D
[01:04:04] <coldhead> i can't tell either
[01:04:06] <coldhead> and i wrote it
[01:04:09] <simonleojung> haha
[01:04:11] <coldhead> i guess it doesn't matter
[01:04:40] <simonleojung> you're on all the time, don't you sleep? +_+
[01:05:19] <coldhead> 5 hours more and i will
[01:05:42] <simonleojung> oh then goodnight to you sir :)
[01:06:45] <g0rd0n> coldhead: heh that rmoves the minutes instead of seconds though
[01:07:24] <coldhead> oops
[01:07:51] <g0rd0n> i found this .replace(/:\d{2}\s/,' ') will try out now
[01:08:32] <g0rd0n> damn doesnt work
[01:10:50] <g0rd0n> ok fixed
[01:11:16] <g0rd0n> shit no i didnt
[01:13:58] <coldhead> g0rd0n: http://jsfiddle.net/XzLzy/
[01:15:32] <g0rd0n> coldhead: yay :)
[01:16:34] <ahandy_> quick question, why is this not working:  http://jsfiddle.net/9VZj5/
[01:16:45] <ahandy_> oh sec, didnt include the hoverintent plugin there, sec
[01:21:37] <ndss56> is jsfiddle server down?
[01:22:04] <coldhead> ?down jsfiddle.net
[01:22:07] <bot-t> coldhead, It's just you. - http://jsfiddle.net is up.
[01:22:25] <coldhead> works for me, ndss56
[01:22:57] <Clorith> Has anyone else experienced issues with IE and jqueryui's datepicker whe ndisplaying multiple months in a single column ?
[01:23:18] <ndss56> coldhead: ok. probably need to reboot.
[01:34:55] <g0rd0n> ok i have a little problem with the jqueyui dialog. i defined a button which has a $.post call in it. if the result was successful, i want the dialog to close, however it does not react on $(this).dialog("close"); it only works if i put it outside of the .post... what can i do about it?
[01:35:06] <ahandy_> is there anyway i could wait for like, 0.2 seconds on hover before doing a function? like hoverIntent, but that isn't working
[01:36:13] <juha_> coldhead: you still here
[01:36:25] <coldhead> i sure am
[01:36:28] <juha_> coldhead: i thought you died of aids
[01:36:31] <coldhead> i am with you, always
[01:36:43] <coldhead> did you dream of me, juha_?
[01:36:51] <gnarf> g0rd0n: save a reference to the dialog...  var dialog = $(this); ... then in the post callback dialog.dialog( "close ")
[01:36:52] <juha_> aaaannnddd iiiiiii-i---iiiii--iii- wiiilllll alllwwwwwwaaaaayssss loooovvvveeeee yoooouuuuu
[01:37:01] <juha_> coldhead: indeed i did
[01:37:06] <g0rd0n> gnarf: ok thank you
[01:37:19] <juha_> coldhead: i had this lovely dream where i got aids. from your head. head-aids
[01:37:49] <coldhead> that is based on an incredible true story
[01:37:56] <coldhead> the story of xmas
[01:37:59] <gnarf> the meaning of "this" is different from function to function
[01:38:11] <gnarf> its pretty common to cache a copy of the "this" you care about tho
[01:41:40] <coldhead> it's so just existential
[01:41:55] <quicksilver> var that = this; // save the particular 'this' in scope. After you've used 'that', you should then use 'thence' and 'thither'.
[01:51:56] <sasori> question: how to select the name of the input form with jquery, instead of using the id ? ..e.g <input name="test" id="testid"> ..in jquery i can select $('#testid').val() ... ?
[01:57:21] <Mariaa`> the code isn't working http://pastie.org/2525319
[01:57:41] <Mariaa`> is this correct usage of width()
[01:59:45] <quicksilver> sasori: $('input[name=test]')
[02:00:31] <sasori> quicksilver: tnx :D
[02:00:42] <quicksilver> Mariaa`: yes.
[02:00:48] <quicksilver> as far as I can see that's fine
[02:01:02] <yan__nick> hey guys, how can i fadein divs back to back?
[02:01:24] <Mariaa`> but that doesn't set the width on img tag quicksilver
[02:02:35] <aaronmcadam> ?nuke
[02:02:35] <bot-t> ** Nuclear Launch Detected **
[02:03:19] <sasori> quicksilver: what if am trying to select the value of the checked radio button..but using the name and not the id ? how's that?
[02:03:48] <xec> Mariaa`: $('#sliderimages img') <-- to select img tags under sliderimages id
[02:03:48] <sasori> i have two radio button and i named it as test[]
[02:04:37] <aaronmcadam> are they meant to be mutually exclusive sasori
[02:04:49] <Mariaa`> thanks xec
[02:05:00] <aaronmcadam> or meant to be mutliple selects
[02:05:17] <sasori> aaronmcadam: nope..it's a gender radio button option ..male or female
[02:05:44] <aaronmcadam> sasori then they should both have the same name
[02:05:48] <aaronmcadam> not an array
[02:05:57] <sasori> you mean..i should remove the [] ?
[02:06:04] <g0rd0n> i added a loading icon which shows up using .ajaxStart binding and it works fine, but the question is, how can i make it that the loading icon shows up in the middle of the screen and the rest of the website becomes darker?
[02:06:12] <aaronmcadam> then you do $('input[name="gender"]:checked')
[02:06:16] <aaronmcadam> yes
[02:06:31] <aaronmcadam> always quote your attr selectors too
[02:06:49] <sasori> cool..thanks :D
[02:06:57] <aaronmcadam> no prob
[02:07:19] <coldhead> ah aaronmcadam is here
[02:07:21] * coldhead clocks off
[02:07:36] <aaronmcadam> coldhead get back here

[02:13:59] <aaronmcadam> 100% no code necessary!
[02:14:23] <juha_> so i can just look at the general direction and it will create me a facebook copy?
[02:15:02] <aaronmcadam> no, facebook wasn't built on rails silly

[02:34:44] <MoTiOnXml> aaronmcadam: re: date/time picker, I managed to come up with a nice UI yesterday :)
[02:34:50] <Maarten_PI> sasori you can use console.log('<?php echo $theError; ?>');
[02:34:54] <johnline3> oh god jsfiddle running so slow
[02:34:57] <MoTiOnXml> aaronmcadam: split fields with masking etc.
[02:35:12] <Maarten_PI> sasori or just use echo and firebug should show the output
[02:36:05] <aaronmcadam> i did say that originally...
[02:36:12] <sasori> i have an if then else statement at my php file ...the else , containts "failed!". $db->error ....at my $.ajax({ success: }) param, it only outputs the "failed" word
[02:36:14] <aaronmcadam> first thing i said to you MoTiOnXml

[02:36:51] <aaronmcadam> still not as good as firebug but getting better
[02:37:03] <MoTiOnXml> aaronmcadam: it's not the implementation that takes time, it's the design and usability, usually (atleast to me)

[02:40:18] <ProLoser|Work> i know
[02:40:22] <ProLoser|Work> ergo my question
[02:40:37] <aaronmcadam> i thought u said there you tried firebug but cudn't montior ajax
[02:40:42] <ProLoser|Work> hmm
[02:40:47] <ProLoser|Work> i mistyped in a later statement
[02:40:53] <ProLoser|Work> i can't figure out how to do it in webkit inspector
[02:40:53] <aaronmcadam> you click on network tab
[02:40:57] <ProLoser|Work> i know how to do it on firebug
[02:41:02] <aaronmcadam> and click ur ajaxes

[02:43:44] <aaronmcadam> the funny thing about web inspector is that you can inspect itself
[02:44:08] <MoTiOnXml> when the post from flash hits the server the auth cookies are missing
[02:44:20] <aaronmcadam> wank
[02:44:22] <aaronmcadam> flashvars?
[02:44:31] <aaronmcadam> would u have to add em in?
[02:44:46] <waldmeister> MoTiOnXml, the flash request has its own session…
[02:45:03] <MoTiOnXml> waldmeister: yea, but how to I assign the cookies to the flash request then?
[02:45:11] <MoTiOnXml> waldmeister: thing is it works locally
[02:45:26] <MoTiOnXml> waldmeister: and works in IE8+, but not in chrome
[02:45:35] <waldmeister> it does? no idea how to assign the cookies
[02:45:51] <MoTiOnXml> yea, it's very unpredictable
[02:46:06] <MoTiOnXml> works locally here, doesn't work locally when on remote desktop session to server
[02:46:18] <waldmeister> I remember having this issue with Uploadify and couldn't solve it except by manually passing the user id in the parameters for the upload request
[02:46:39] <MoTiOnXml> yea, i guess i'll have to do that as well, but it used to work
[02:46:39] <waldmeister> encrypted of course but that felt really bad ^^
[02:46:55] <MoTiOnXml> not sure if it's a change to flash itself
[02:47:00] <MoTiOnXml> security-wise
[02:47:15] <MoTiOnXml> wondering if a silverlight-based solution would work
[02:47:31] <MoTiOnXml> i'm a C# developer so i guess it would make sense to just take ownership of that part too
[02:48:22] <MoTiOnXml> not sure if silverlight has the same limitations
[02:48:51] <waldmeister> no idea..I'm a php dev myself..no idea how to code flash or silverlight :)

[02:53:52] <dwarder> selecte == checked

[02:58:15] <faLUCE> hi, $(#divId).position().left gives me the left position of the element. How can I set that position using jquery ?
[02:58:47] <dwarder> waldmeister: i don't want user to submit the form if he didn't check at least one checkbox from each set
[02:59:43] <waldmeister> then observe each checkbox for the onClick event and after it was clicked check if it's checked or rather if there's one checked for each set. if there is then enable the submit button, otherwise disable it
[03:00:56] <dwarder> waldmeister: http://jsfiddle.net/SE3A3/1/
[03:01:32] <dwarder> waldmeister: so user must select one from set1, one from set2, and one checkbox from set3
[03:01:35] <dwarder> any checkbox
[03:02:23] <aaronmcadam> that's not how u do a fiddleeee
[03:02:34] <aaronmcadam> you've not even tried to write some js there man

[04:06:44] <Mariaa> ravenzz:  yes
[04:06:50] <Mariaa> i can't
[04:06:51] <aaronmcadam> you can use percentages you know
[04:07:08] <aaronmcadam> why can't you?
[04:07:32] <Mariaa> is there a way to set it through css same as that of sidebar
[04:07:41] <aaronmcadam> you're gonna be lucky if you can get away without a flash of unstyled content
[04:08:03] <aaronmcadam> unless you preload every image and then resize them and re add
[04:08:07] <aaronmcadam> sounds very messy
[04:09:07] <ravenzz> the code is not that clean, but .. Are the images within an iframe?
[04:09:43] <Mariaa> ravenzz:  the images are being loaded from a website, but i can put them locally too
[04:09:45] <Industrial> I'm using both jquery tmpl as jquery.tablesorter plugins. I have a table that I am appending to after document ready with jquery template. jquery.tablesorter will not sort the new table tr entries I'm adding. WHy is this?
[04:09:54] <ravenzz> oh no

[04:10:21] <Mariaa> aaronmcadam:  the requirement was to resize the slider automatically, each time the user resizes the sidebar
[04:11:05] <Mariaa> ravenzz: i will clean up the tags, is that what makes width not work on images
[04:11:41] <Mariaa> i was fixing the jquery width setting for images, i will rewrite the html after that
[04:12:19] <ravenzz> Mariaa which slider are you using?
[04:12:23] <ravenzz> what is the plugin name?
[04:12:47] <Mariaa> http://slidesjs.com/ ravenzz

[04:16:20] <Mariaa> ravenzz:  yes
[04:16:44] <Mariaa> ravenzz: i want the slider plus the images resized
[04:17:13] <ravenzz> like a fluid slider?
[04:17:21] <ravenzz> is that responsive web design or what?
[04:18:13] <Mariaa> ravenzz:  no i want the user to set the width in the html, and then the slide show shoul;d adjust itself

[04:36:40] <Industrial> It also messes up if i call $().tablesorter() twice, once after the add
[04:37:00] <Industrial> apparently it makes an index and keeps an index, doesnt sort any of the elements you add that are not in the index
[04:37:30] <twoface> Hi. If i have a link that links to a page that returns a file (but is about a minute to do so), is it possible to bind an event on the "finished loading page, now downloading" event?
[04:38:49] <shellox_> hi
[04:38:58] <Jon47> twoface, any chance you can just remove that 1 minute wait?
[04:39:30] <twoface> Jon47, nope, it is a script generating a large excel file
[04:39:53] <Jon47> twoface you could try document.ready on it?
[04:39:59] <shellox_> i defined some click event for several buttons on a html site and this works fine. If i add a button with jquery, which belongs to the same class like the other buttons.
[04:40:22] <twoface> Jon47, but the document is ready - wouldn't that just fire the event at once?
[04:40:29] <shellox_> The problem is that the dynamically generated button haven't an event
[04:40:42] <shellox_> you have an idea how i can fix this?
[04:41:28] <shellox_> button click add a new <div><input type="button class="pushme"></div>
[04:41:45] <shellox_> and this button have no events
[04:42:13] <brad> shellox_: missing a "
[04:42:53] <shellox_> brad: ok, i typed it here, but in my source code there isnt a missing " ;)
[04:43:06] <brad> aha :)
[04:43:15] <donCams> Mariaa: don't know what's wrong with your code :)
[04:43:20] <Jon47> shellox_ i think you're interested in .live
[04:43:26] <Jon47> ?live @ shellox_
[04:43:28] <bot-t> shellox_, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[04:44:25] <shellox_> Jon47: never heard of it, i will read this ;)
[04:44:27] <Mariaa> donCams:  ah ok, thanks for looking at the code
[04:44:45] <Mariaa> i think i have found the problem
[04:45:00] <Jon47> twface i think you're trying to use jquery to solve what's essentially a server side problem
[04:48:13] <twoface> Jon47, it is not a server side problem - i just want a loading animation while the browser loads the page
[04:48:34] <kinga> how can my script work for a while then all the sudden say $ is not defined
[04:48:56] <kinga> i swear i didn't change anything to make that error appear
[04:49:25] <shellox_> Jon47: your advice rescued my day :-)
[04:49:27] <shellox_> works now
[04:49:47] <walid> hi guys! i'm looking for a plugin that would show a little text field above an image when scrolled over. smth like a black box with an arrow pointing down on the image
[04:50:38] <Jon47> shellox_ for more info read about event delegation, you can really improve your performance sometimes
[04:51:06] <kinga> could you guys help me? i don't even know how should i start explaining the issue
[04:51:13] <Jon47> .live is essentially delegating the event for a selector to the document, but you can do much more with it
[04:52:01] <shellox_> Jon47: ok, thanks
[04:52:21] <Jon47> twoface how do you get the document to the user?  does it open a new tab/window?
[04:52:33] <rosieres> I want to load a script into head. I run into an "unterminated string literal" error. How can i prevent this ?  http://jsfiddle.net/FJyAX/2/
[04:52:40] <twoface> Jon47, currently is uses location.href
[04:54:36] <Jon47> twoface how about this..
[04:54:37] <Jon47> step 1, give the user a "please wait" message on the page while you do an asynchronous request to the server to build the file
[04:54:37] <Jon47> step 2. when the file is built, return the URL to the file in the request
[04:54:37] <Jon47> step 3, redirect page to that URL
[04:55:10] <twoface> yes, that would be doable - but will require a bit of more work :)
[04:55:13] <twoface> thanks, i'll consider it
[05:01:31] <walid> i need smth more or less like on facebook, when you hover over a friend's name
[05:01:56] <walid> there's a box that appears over the name. i need smth similar, much simpler in fact, just a black box
[05:04:11] <rosieres> walid: it´s called tooltip . . . where´s the problem . . .
[05:04:41] <walid> rosieres: thank you!
[05:04:45] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[05:04:50] <walid> i just didn't have the right term to do the search :D
[05:05:00] <Double_Rainbow> can we technically put a "$(document).ready(function() {	" inside another " $(document).ready(function() {	" ?
[05:05:12] <rosieres> walid: ;-) NP
[05:05:58] <Double_Rainbow> like can we put a document.ready function inside another document.ready function ?
[05:07:05] <rosieres> Double_Rainbow: In fact I don´t know. But it sounds like this makes no sense . . .
[05:07:22] <twoface> Double_Rainbow, sure you can, but it makes no sense :)
[05:07:56] <twoface> if the document is ready and calls the first, the second will be called at once as well
[05:09:05] <rosieres> can anybody help me with my literal problem ? ->   http://jsfiddle.net/FJyAX/2 -> see console
[05:10:21] <rosieres> seems to be a problem with datatype but dunno how to set it . . .
[05:10:32] <twoface> rosieres, .getScript executes the script already - why would you insert it into head as well?
[05:11:02] <rosieres> twoface: ahh . . . true ! Thank you . . . !
[05:17:22] <tomtomaso> hi
[05:17:44] <juria_roberts> how do I get all the values of the multi selectbox in an array?
[05:18:00] <juria_roberts> it need not be selected
[05:19:33] <tomtomaso> anyone experience with IE8 crashes and the 1.6.3?
[05:20:14] <tomtomaso> im working at a shop, and right at the checkout process during payment, the 1.6.3 crashes only in ie8
[05:20:24] <tomtomaso> www.iqimport.ch
[05:21:05] <tomtomaso> i anyone has a hint for me, would be adorable
[05:21:05] <twoface> juria_roberts, perhaps something like var arr = $.map($("selectbox option"), function(val, i) { return $(val[i]).val(); });
[05:21:33] <juria_roberts> twoface: ok will try
[05:22:35] <juria_roberts> twoface: var arr = $.map($("#customer_chose_index option"), function(val, i) { return $(val[i]).val(); });
[05:22:39] <juria_roberts> returns undefined
[05:24:09] <twoface> perhaps $.makeArray on the $("#custome... ?
[05:24:35] <DarsVaeda> I need help with this function: http://jsfiddle.net/J3PGq/3/ -> I need the object as a valid url array in the $.post but it "set[bildlupe[1]]" instead of "set[bildlupe][1]"
[05:24:46] <DarsVaeda> +is
[05:25:12] <juria_roberts> twoface: cud u write the whole statement im not familiar with map or makeArray
[05:25:51] <twoface> var arr = $.map($.makeArray($("selectbox option")), function(val, i) { return $(val[i]).val(); });
[05:25:56] <twoface> but i am just guessing
[05:26:38] <juria_roberts> twoface: still undefined
[05:27:10] <twoface> then you need to do your own debugging - perhaps try to see if the $.makeArray returns a proper array with the elements
[05:27:54] <tomtomaso> no one over here, how can help me with my IE8 crash?
[05:29:10] <tomtomaso> it seems it crashes durch the prepend function...i guess
[05:29:17] <see7di> $t=$('#index'); $t.click(function(e,$t){   alert($t); });//why show undefined?
[05:29:41] <Nasga> does anyone know the trick to store a json in hidden html field an use parseJson to retrieve it later (on another page) ?
[05:30:08] <ablomen> see7di, because you re-define $t in the scope of the click callback
[05:30:19] <ablomen> remove ,$t from the function
[05:31:34] <see7di> how can i do it?
[05:32:06] <ablomen> see7di, like i said, remove ,$t from the function declaration
[05:32:16] <ablomen> so you just get function (e) {
[05:32:24] <see7di> i try
[05:33:06] <see7di> thank you very much
[05:33:48] <tomtomaso> i hate the internet explorer...
[05:34:25] <Jon47> whats the problem tomtomaso?
[05:35:00] <tomtomaso> jquery crashes in IE8 on my shop projekt. at the checkout process www.iqimport.ch
[05:35:17] <Jon47> it *crashes*
[05:35:39] <tomtomaso> sry
[05:36:22] <ahandy> is there any known bug for jquery's animate opacity and opera?
[05:36:22] <kinga> guys why does it give me the $ is not defined error
[05:36:23] <tomtomaso> i guess there is a problem with the prepend function, but the debugger in the IE8 is wordless
[05:36:31] <kinga> when i included the jquery file in html ?
[05:37:35] <Jon47> kinga, give us an example
[05:38:09] <kinga> i dont know how to give you an example
[05:38:11] <Jon47> tomtomaso, whenever I find a bug in a jquery function, 100% of the time it's a problem in my own code that's calling jquery
[05:38:13] <kinga> everything seems legit
[05:38:15] <kinga> i didn't change anything
[05:38:31] <kinga> just added a global $(document).ready thingy
[05:38:40] <Jon47> kinga can we see a URL or something?
[05:38:58] <symfonyMan> hello all
[05:39:05] <Jon47> just describing the issue to us won't help, you'll just tell us the stuff you know, and since you don't know the solution, we probably won't enough data to find a solution either
[05:39:30] <symfonyMan> how can we call a function with $.proxy and pass a parameters
[05:39:32] <symfonyMan> ?
[05:39:33] <tomtomaso> Jon47 yes i know...but i don`t find the bug, an there is a lot of code from the magento shop, which is not from me....and i have no nerves
[05:39:36] <tomtomaso> anymore
[05:40:40] <symfonyMan> no ideas ?
[05:42:02] <Baribal> Hi. Is there an easy way to overrule jquerys theming?
[05:42:34] <Jon47> tomtomaso, magento is just server side right? you described your issue as being client side
[05:43:18] <angelkoilov> Baribal: jqueryUI ?
[05:44:09] <Baribal> Umm... Could be, yes...
[05:44:41] <Baribal> ...but I just found out that people here rolled a custom theme file, so my question was misaimed anyways.
[05:53:07] <MarcelT3> someone up?
[05:53:40] <tomtomaso> Jon47: magento is a shop system, and it has a a lot of validation at the checkout process at the frontend
[05:54:17] <MarcelT3> is there a good way to make selections "distinct"? like i have this one http://jsfiddle.net/wCrEF/ and the effect is applied to all divs with the same value. but it should be different values for the first div.th-auto and the next div.th-auto ...
[05:54:46] <danzik17> MarcelT3: see ?unique
[05:54:46] <bot-t> MarcelT3, jQuery.unique(array): Sorts an array of DOM elements, in place, with the duplicates removed. Note that this only works on arrays of DOM elements, not strings or numbers. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.unique/
[05:55:46] <MarcelT3> thx danzik17
[05:56:51] <MarcelT3> i think that won´t do it.
[06:02:55] <tomtomaso> Jon47?
[06:03:10] <Jon47> tomtomaso sorry, no experience with magento
[06:03:39] <tomtomaso> ok, magento is working, only my jquery checkout accordeon has a problem in IE(
[06:03:41] <tomtomaso> IE8
[06:03:42] <tomtomaso> ^^
[06:04:04] <danzik17> MarcelT3: So you're just trying to alternate the application of some CSS style?
[06:04:04] <Industrial> I have a problem with jQuery Template and selectors; https://gist.github.com/69f5e75d3bf9fc23b544 namely line 80 does not print anything where I expect it to.
[06:04:09] <kinga> hey guys could you help me with an issue here? http://pastebin.com/YThq5HG3
[06:04:14] <kinga> everything's on that pastebin
[06:04:28] <Jon47> if you can't find an answer try checking in later, the channel gets more active later in teh day
[06:04:31] <Industrial> I add content (td's) to a tr with jquery template, then I try to search trhough the children that were just inserted
[06:04:41] <Industrial> it can't find children (e.g. 'button')
[06:06:21] <dwarder> aaronmcadam: thank you, for the latest version
[06:06:46] <dwarder> aaronmcadam: i'm reading about how to write methods for validation plugin atm
[06:07:11] <dwarder> aaronmcadam: was thinking about implementing this for the plugin
[06:07:28] <dwarder> was awa
[06:07:29] <dwarder> y
[06:08:45] <aaronmcadam> well you could take what I wrote
[06:08:52] <aaronmcadam> it would work with generic code
[06:09:19] <fkefer> Hi all!
[06:10:06] <fkefer> I'm trying to create an element that's hidden by CSS and start a function that randomly fades the element out, changes background and fades it in again
[06:10:27] <fkefer> i want to use this also to _initially_ fade the element in.
[06:10:52] <aaronmcadam> sounds like you want an animation queue
[06:12:02] <aaronmcadam> fkefer: http://jqueryfordesigners.com/api-queue-dequeue/
[06:14:06] <fkefer> aaronmcadam: i thought it had something to do with that, but i didn't understand this totally, esp. as .css(...) worked, .animate(...) didn't...
[06:14:09] <fkefer> i'll read into this
[06:14:09] <fkefer> thanks
[06:14:15] <aaronmcadam> watch the vid
[06:14:17] <aaronmcadam> simples
[06:16:05] <tomtomaso> later i am in switzerland...later i am at home, not at the office...
[06:17:39] <ahandy> can you guys help  me a bit? i have a jquery slideshow that uses opacity to change between images, but it's not working on Opera.
[06:18:25] <tomtomaso> ahandy: but no background-images?
[06:18:51] <ahandy> tomtomaso: sorry?
[06:18:58] <ahandy> tomtomaso: the images dont have a background-image, no
[06:19:11] <ahandy> tomtomaso: it's a div containing an image and a caption.
[06:20:01] <tomtomaso> ...ok, that was my question, its an normal image, not a bg-image
[06:20:31] <fkefer> aaronmcadam: i'm afraid it still doesn't work as expected
[06:20:39] <ahandy> tomtomaso: nope. the animation on opera.. well there is no animation, it just waits till the animation is done, hides the image quickly and shows the second
[06:20:43] <fkefer> in fact, i'm not trying to manipulate a different object
[06:20:53] <kinga> could some1 help me pls? http://pastebin.com/YThq5HG3
[06:20:56] <fkefer> but the very _same_ as the one of the queue
[06:22:43] <tomtomaso> kinga: your problem is that  on line 13 the alert is undefined?
[06:22:49] <fkefer> aaronmcadam: you can see all code here
[06:22:50] <fkefer> http://die-physiotherapeutin.com/neu/
[06:23:19] <kinga> yes
[06:23:42] <kinga> i don't know why is it undefined if i changed in another function, as long as that variable is on the global scope
[06:25:07] <walid> hi guys!
[06:25:10] <tomtomaso> ChangeHash and the alert is not in the document ready function, so you defined a varibale without values, and you Alert theis var...the ajax stuff runs a lot of time later
[06:25:23] <tomtomaso> so its undefined
[06:25:36] <walid> i'm trying to implement a tooltip on my site, and i'm stuck at the very beginning...
[06:25:39] <kinga> oh ok, i'll scrap document ready then
[06:25:46] <walid> (from this: http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/tooltip/index.htm )
[06:25:56] <walid> i get a object has no indexOf
[06:26:06] <walid> method*
[06:26:14] <tomtomaso> kinga?
[06:26:36] <kinga> yes? it doesn't work without document ready :<
[06:26:57] <kinga> should i make it synchronous ?
[06:27:00] <walid> i followed the instructions, but no luck...
[06:27:01] <walid> :(
[06:27:16] <kinga> the ajax call
[06:28:23] <tomtomaso> kinga: why do you want to alert the ChangeHash at line 13? it doe not make sense, the ajax call, is Async...so why alert the hash at the initialisation?
[06:28:38] <kinga> i wanted to know if it's good  :P
[06:28:44] <kinga> so i won't run into problems later on
[06:29:08] <tomtomaso> what do you mean with "good"?
[06:29:16] <kinga> if it contains the hash or not
[06:29:25] <kborchers> ?ajax101 @ kinga
[06:29:26] <bot-t> kinga, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42
[06:29:40] <KarateKip3> what's the use of (function($) { ... })(jQuery);  when dealing with library conflicts if you can't call the functions inside it from outside?
[06:29:49] <koyetsu> i've got some kinda syntax error trying to set an array vriable via a $.each and was hopeing someone could tell me what i've done wrong. this is the line where the problem is and i've tried every way of doing it that i can imagine.   truckCrumb.push [ new google.maps.LatLng(val.lat, val.lng)];
[06:30:10] <tomtomaso> so try: var ChangeHash = "";
[06:30:35] <tomtomaso> and check with ChangeHash.length > 0
[06:32:15] <kborchers> koyetsu: you're using [] when you should be using ()  truckCrumb.push( new google.maps.LatLng(val.lat, val.lng) );
[06:33:14] <kinga> tomtomaso, or i can do a complete function in $.ajax
[06:33:27] <tomtomaso> prototypjs && jquery -> %$/$Â§/$/"$("&(!$
[06:33:30] <koyetsu> that's how i had it originally with either () or [] i get an error in firebug stating that truck crumb is unset. if i drop a ; at val.lng); i get an error about needing a ; before function
[06:34:24] <kborchers> ?p @ koyetsu
[06:34:25] <bot-t> koyetsu, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:35:52] <walid> hi!
[06:35:59] <walid> does smone have a minute for me?
[06:36:06] <tomtomaso> go for it
[06:36:20] <walid> i try to implement smth, working in jsfiddle, but not on my website...
[06:36:26] <walid> i don't understand.. :(
[06:36:34] <walid> http://jsfiddle.net/UF4H9/
[06:36:39] <walid> here it works,
[06:36:46] <walid> and on http://vbbros.net/d6/project/p_12
[06:36:57] <walid> i get an object has no indexOf method
[06:38:47] <aaronmcadam> it must not be returning a string walid
[06:38:53] <aaronmcadam> does your selector work
[06:39:12] <walid> aaronmcadam: sry +/- noob here ^^
[06:39:18] <walid> what do you mean by work?
[06:39:25] <aaronmcadam> does it return an element
[06:39:30] <aaronmcadam> or a set
[06:39:43] <walid> hm
[06:39:46] <walid> i don't know
[06:39:50] <dpritchett> looksl ike you are running jquery 1.2.6
[06:39:56] <aaronmcadam> ?ftj @ walid
[06:39:56] <bot-t> walid, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[06:39:59] <walid> have you seen the fiddle?
[06:40:03] <aaronmcadam> yeh
[06:40:11] <aaronmcadam> debug it
[06:40:27] <dpritchett> fiddle is using jquery 1.6.3
[06:40:28] <walid> aaronmcadam: yes i know, but i just use the plugin
[06:40:40] <aaronmcadam> short answer, find a new plugin
[06:40:44] <aaronmcadam> tipsy is good
[06:40:46] <walid> so should i debug the plugin??(working in jsfiddle, btw)
[06:41:01] <aaronmcadam> aaah
[06:41:04] <aaronmcadam> it's bloody jquery tools
[06:41:13] <aaronmcadam> the worst library ever written hehe
[06:41:19] <kborchers> jquery tools sucks!
[06:41:22] <pachet> ^
[06:41:23] <aaronmcadam> biiiig time
[06:41:24] <walid> aaronmcadam: tipsy seems perfect
[06:41:27] <aaronmcadam> yep it is
[06:41:27] <walid> lol
[06:41:28] <walid> ok
[06:41:40] <walid> i'll avoid it in the future, i promess!!
[06:41:40] <walid> :)
[06:41:45] <walid> thanks!
[06:41:53] <aaronmcadam> yeah jquery tools, delete that fucker, don't even send it to the wastebin, shift + delete that piece of shit
[06:42:23] <aaronmcadam> walid: it breaks jquery plugin conventions and all sorts of crap, it's API is bloody terrible
[06:42:41] <walid> aaronmcadam: hahaha
[06:42:44] <kborchers> walid: you can get the same stuff from jQuery UI only much better written and flexible
[06:42:46] <walid> alright alright!!
[06:42:49] <aaronmcadam> tehee
[06:42:53] <aaronmcadam> you weren't to know
[06:42:56] <walid> i'll def keep that in mind
[06:43:08] <walid> it's just the first plugin i found, and it was fine for me ^^
[06:43:15] <walid> now i know
[06:43:16] <walid> :D
[06:43:17] <aaronmcadam> tipsy is handy, it automatically repositions based on where the element is
[06:43:43] <aaronmcadam> or you can turn that feature off
[06:44:16] <kborchers> walid: tipsy is nice but soon you won't need that either ... jQuery UI tooltip is coming :)
[06:44:21] <fkefer> aaronmcadam: i took the time and put it into jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/EWUbT/
[06:44:23] <aaronmcadam> ah nice kborchers
[06:44:43] <kborchers> scheduled for 1.9
[06:44:48] <aaronmcadam> which is when?
[06:44:54] <aaronmcadam> roughly
[06:44:59] <sphinxxx> anyone familiar with bxslider?
[06:45:21] <walid> well, i'll go with tipsy for now :D
[06:45:25] <walid> thank you guys!
[06:45:27] <xckpd7> question: I'm going through a book
[06:45:43] <kborchers> not sure if we have a def timeline ... we're working hard though. ajpiano might have a better idea but i don't remember seeing a date
[06:45:58] <aaronmcadam> cool cool
[06:46:05] <pachet> so tomorrow
[06:46:13] <xckpd7> "jQuery Enlightenment"... they're having me use the .eq method and the book says it's 0 based, but I'm using new jQuery and the book is based off of the old jQuery.... is eq no longer 0 based?
[06:46:24] <aaronmcadam> shouldn't be
[06:46:36] <aaronmcadam> ?tias @ xckpd7
[06:46:37] <bot-t> xckpd7, Try It And See
[06:46:40] <kborchers> pachet: heh, well technically you could start using stuff today if you want, as long as you don't want it supported or guaranteed not to break your shit ;)
[06:47:14] <dwarder> aaronmcadam: can't figure out how can i submit for in case of 'valid'
[06:47:18] <aaronmcadam> is there a .latest build too kborchers
[06:47:42] <kborchers> aaronmcadam: http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js
[06:47:43] <aaronmcadam> eh? dwarder?
[06:47:48] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[06:47:56] <kborchers> and http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.css
[06:47:57] <dwarder> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/ZJRGB/#base
[06:48:21] <aaronmcadam> what's the problem
[06:48:36] <dwarder> aaronmcadam: i wan't the form to be submited if value is valid
[06:48:38] <kborchers> but that's latest merged into master, not released obviously and can change at any time
[06:48:43] <aaronmcadam> oh simple
[06:48:57] <aaronmcadam> one min
[06:49:18] <dwarder> i tried self.submit();
[06:49:31] <dwarder> checking for 'valid' ....
[06:49:49] <bittyx-laptop> i have something like $(selector).appendTo(something).hide().children().hide(); and i'd like to do the hide() actions before i append the original set to something. should i do $(selector).hide().children().hide().end().appendTo(something) ? ie. is .end() what i'm looking for here, since i'm appending the original result set, and not the children?
[06:50:29] <aaronmcadam> gimme a min dwarder
[06:53:25] <aaronmcadam> dwarder: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/ZJRGB/
[06:54:46] <walid> got it up and runnng in barely 5minutes!
[06:54:49] <walid> thanks!
[06:56:00] <dwarder> aaronmcadam: thanks
[06:56:02] <aaronmcadam> got it dwarder?
[06:56:21] <dwarder> aaronmcadam: yup
[07:00:24] <thefalling> For some reason im gettin an error on my jquery script online in IE 8, works fine in ff/ie9 :S  "http://pastebin.com/QxdXJCJG"
[07:01:51] <Maarten_PI> in this code, the cData-function is called before the callback function from getJSON, which makes it impossible for me to retrieve the data in the other function. Anyone an idea how to fix this?
[07:01:55] <Maarten_PI> http://pastebin.com/pWkYhHZr
[07:01:57] <kborchers> thefalling: my guess is that you are getting more than one checked checkbox back from your find and .val() won't work on a collection
[07:07:00] <thefalling> Well there is only one checkbox in that td, and i even added first() for the hell of it with no luck
[07:07:24] <kborchers> thefalling: can you fiddle a working example?
[07:08:53] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: last night someone asked what order events fire in based on speficity, and I thought jquery just fires it in order you define bind / live
[07:09:11] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: did you know it goes all binds before all lives and then specificity matters? http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/q4GA2/
[07:11:12] <Dave_Stein> it was news to me :)
[07:11:19] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: that makes sense ... binds would happen before lives because live waits for the event to bubble up to the document while bind is at the element ... and yes then they fire in the order bound
[07:11:45] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: it's not in the order bound though... CSS specifity has to do with it
[07:13:12] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: check the array, you'll see I repeat several selectors meaning they shouldnt have grouped so nicely in the body appends
[07:13:53] <aaronmcadam> exactlyyyy
[07:14:14] <Dave_Stein> er sorry, groupedo rder on lives
[07:14:18] <Dave_Stein> binds in order
[07:14:47] <tomtomaso> if anyone has a hint for me why my jquery bib in IE8 crash, i would ne thankful  -> www.iqimport.ch -> a product to the basket -> basket -> zur Kasse -> BUM
[07:15:10] <tomtomaso> i guess its a roblem between the prototyp & jquery event handler...
[07:17:09] <Dave_Stein> ahhh coworker pointed it out to make more sense
[07:17:10] <Dave_Stein> Lives fire in order you define, grouped by when you defined the first callback for that selector.
[07:17:40] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: my guess is it has to do with how the live bindings are created and how the browser bubbles those events ... have to admit i didn't know that would happen but it seems to make sense
[07:17:42] <Dave_Stein> so if $('#test').live is made before another live and then you do $('#test').live again... both test callbacks fire before the middle one
[07:17:48] <kborchers> hah, i was just about to say something like that
[07:18:00] <Jay1> Hi, I'm working on my first jQuery plugin which converts input type=range into draggable sliding things.  Could someone with more experience tell me if the code is alright and how to make my dragging more responsive? http://jsdo.it/TheSisb/pFWU
[07:19:02] <Maarten_PI> hi, does anyone know how to execute a function in a jquery ajax-call before other functions?
[07:19:23] <pachet> Jay1: you have the mousemove event bound to the element, meaning that in order to fire that event the mouse has to be over the element, which feels clunky
[07:19:26] <Maarten_PI> it seems like jQuery continues executing other functions, before actually getting to the callback
[07:19:34] <Dave_Stein> Maarten_PI: sync: false option
[07:19:42] <Dave_Stein> Maarten_PI can stall browser though while it waits
[07:19:44] <pachet> Jay1: if you bind with a specific namespace to document and then unbind that namespace on mouseup it should feel a little smoother
[07:19:59] <Maarten_PI> Dave_Stein, ah, thx!
[07:20:07] <kborchers> oh Dave_Stein, don't recommend sync!
[07:20:19] <Maarten_PI> i c, so it's not recommended
[07:20:26] <kborchers> people will go use it without regard for the nastiness it causes
[07:20:30] <Dave_Stein> Maarten_PI right, since it stalls browser
[07:20:48] <Dave_Stein> Maarten_PI the better way is to remove the lines after the AJAX call, move it into a function
[07:20:57] <Dave_Stein> Maarten_PI then use it in the success callback
[07:21:02] <kborchers> my favorite line is if you were meant to use async: false, it would be called SJAX
[07:21:14] <Dave_Stein> haha yeah
[07:21:24] <Maarten_PI> Dave_Stein ha, that sounds a lot like what, I'm looking for (the last few hours)
[07:21:30] <Maarten_PI> Dave_Stein do you have an example?
[07:21:50] <kborchers> ?ajax @ Maarten_PI
[07:21:50] <bot-t> Maarten_PI, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[07:21:55] <Dave_Stein> $.ajax({ url : 'blah', success : function() { ... });
[07:21:57] <kborchers> ?ajax101 @ Maarten_PI
[07:21:57] <bot-t> Maarten_PI, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42
[07:22:01] <Maarten_PI> you mean, like a function in the succes function?
[07:22:04] <pachet> ?promise @ Maarten_PI
[07:22:05] <bot-t> Maarten_PI, .promise() - Return a Promise object to observe when all actions of a certain type bound to the collection, queued or not, have finished. http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[07:23:26] <Maarten_PI> thx guys, i'm seeing some new things now. giving it a try
[07:23:35] <Jay1> pachet: so basically document.mousemove?
[07:25:03] <pachet> $(document).bind("mousemove.namespace-a", function(){ //whatever}); $(elem).bind("mouseup",function(){$(document).unbind("mousemove.namespace-a");});
[07:30:49] <Jay1> pachet: Ah now I understand it (after googling namespaces).  Thanks!
[07:32:21] <pachet> Jay1: yw :D
[07:33:33] <pachet> Jay1: another suggestion might be to cancel the text highlighting that happens when you drag the mouse
[07:33:39] <pachet> can be kind of quirky thouhg
[07:33:41] <johnkpaul> is there any chance that jQuery will ever support :nth-of-type?
[07:33:41] <pachet> *though
[07:34:05] <pachet> take a look at the css user-select rules, and the onselectstart event
[07:34:56] <johnkpaul> from the one bug report filed 5 years ago, I am guessing no
[07:35:03] <johnkpaul> but I wonder why
[07:35:37] <Jay1> pachet: I was wondering about that, I'll look into it thanks. http://jsdo.it/TheSisb/pFWU Can you check if I understood your concept correctly?
[07:36:42] <pachet> Jay1: yep exactly
[07:36:56] <Jay1> user-select + vendor variations added
[07:38:22] <tomtomaso> anyone a good tutorial link, how to implate prototypjs and jquery without a crash, in my case IE 8?
[07:39:24] <SPYGAME> hey guys, i'm having trouble making an ajax call, here's my code http://pastie.org/2525599, i don't get the data (referrer) when a request comes in, what's wrong?
[07:39:37] <tomtomaso> PS: to use prototyp was not my idea...it was my boss
[07:40:49] <timing_> tomtomaso: noconflict() ?
[07:41:02] <SPYGAME> anyone?
[07:41:09] <timing_> tomtomaso: also stand up to your boss
[07:41:12] <SPYGAME> i need some help please
[07:41:28] <timing_> SPYGAME: I cannot read your pasty it's way to dar
[07:41:35] <timing_> dark
[07:41:39] <tomtomaso> ...actually he is in holiday
[07:42:03] <timing> tomtomaso: do it your way and finish it before he is back, then you can say: look what I did mister
[07:42:03] <tomtomaso> noConflict...it is in the prototyp file...
[07:42:12] <timing> tomtomaso: not it's jquery's
[07:42:16] <tomtomaso> ...now its to late
[07:42:25] <pachet> johnkpaul: resig wrote up his rationale for not writing in nth-of-type : http://ejohn.org/blog/selectors-that-people-actually-use/
[07:42:33] <SPYGAME> timing_: use slate or any other theme
[07:42:34] <pachet> so i guess chalk it up to "not very useful"
[07:42:47] <pachet> google shows a bunch of links for writing it in manually
[07:42:49] <timing> SPYGAME: O I can choose my own :-)
[07:42:52] <tomtomaso> timing: yes noconfilct is jquery....and i have it in firtst line of the prototyp fw
[07:43:05] <SPYGAME> timing: yeah
[07:43:47] <tomtomaso> ...$.noConflict()   ...   var Prototype = {
[07:45:17] <johnkpaul> pachet: oddly, I agree with many of his arguments, except for nth-of-type
[07:45:24] <tomtomaso> no one?
[07:46:21] <johnkpaul> I very often come across designs that have different colors for every __ element where it isn't convenient to use nth-child
[07:46:55] <moin> hello
[07:47:04] <moin> can anyone tell me the meaning of "this" in this example?         var text = $("input[id=search-text]", this);
[07:47:31] <ajpiano> moin it's the context
[07:47:34] <ajpiano> ?jQuery
[07:47:34] <bot-t> jQuery(selector, [context]): Accepts a string containing a CSS selector which is then used to match a set of elements. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[07:47:35] <kborchers> moin: "this" is the context
[07:47:48] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: no one's saying you can't use it in your CSS
[07:48:05] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: I know, I'm just annoyed that selectivizer won't support it
[07:48:18] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: but for every new pseudoselector that we want to support in jQuery that is supported by QSA, we have to go and add code to make those things work in non-QSA browsers
[07:48:47] <johnkpaul> I'm starting to read the selectivizer source to see if I just drop in $.expr[':']['nth-of-type'], if it will work
[07:48:48] <ajpiano> and those things get really hairy, really quickly
[07:48:56] <johnkpaul> oh I see
[07:49:04] <johnkpaul> I guess I assumed that it was already written
[07:49:06] <ajpiano> we already have a lot of trouble just supporting :first :last :eq() etc as selectors
[07:49:07] <johnkpaul> and then subsequently removed
[07:49:25] <ajpiano> no it's never been there
[07:49:34] <ajpiano> http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix#Custom_Selector_Improvements_or_Bug_Fixes
[07:50:21] <johnkpaul> I see
[07:50:44] <johnkpaul> the easiest solution here is probably just to reorder some of the html so that I can use nth child
[07:50:46] <johnkpaul> instead of nth of type
[07:51:04] <SPYGAME> timing: any ideas?
[07:51:21] <johnkpaul> or just use modernizer and explciitly add classes for non modern browsers instead of using selectivzer/jquery
[07:58:08] <ccmonster> Basically little confused. page.State = $.extend({},true,st); should basically clone st. But its not. When I log out st, its showing the correct stuff.
[07:58:13] <moin> kborchers:  var text = $("input[id=search-text]", this);               what does context mean here?
[07:59:01] <moin> does anyone know, how to "delete" all child elements, but not the first one?
[07:59:15] <kborchers> moin: that selects inputs with an id equal to what ever is in your search-text var within "this" rather than the whole document
[07:59:24] <timing> SPYGAME: sorry was away
[07:59:52] <ccmonster> $('li:not(:first-child)').remove(), or perhaps, $('ul li').slice(1).remove()
[08:00:00] <timing> SPYGAME: data should be an object
[08:00:14] <SPYGAME> timing: {}
[08:00:23] <timing> SPYGAME: like: {'referrer': location.href}
[08:00:25] <pachet> slice++
[08:00:39] <timing> SPYGAME: however, I think all browser send a referer with ajax requests already?
[08:01:01] <ccmonster> Slice is nice and performent as well, i believe
[08:01:11] <SPYGAME> timing: yeah that's right, but i need something else as well using onPlay event
[08:01:18] <timing> otherwise: {'referrer': location.href, 'video_url': jwplayer().getPlaylistItem().file}
[08:01:27] <kborchers> ccmonster, moin: definitely slice would be better but you would want slice(0)
[08:01:45] <moin> kborchers: thanks
[08:01:50] <ccmonster> got ya
[08:01:53] <moin> ccmonster: thanks
[08:15:19] <ccmonster> kborchers, Question --  Basically little confused. page.State = $.extend({},true,st); should basically clone st. But its not. When I log out st, its showing the correct stuff. What could be the issue here? http://pastie.org/2526882
[08:19:15] <kborchers> ccmonster: don't you want page.State = $.extend(true,{},st); ?
[08:19:15] <ccmonster> any ideas?
[08:19:45] <ccmonster> what you mean? i want to essentially overwrite page.State with st.
[08:20:53] <kborchers> the first arg should be boolean (deep or not), then your target (empty object), then your object to merge with target
[08:21:07] <kborchers> ?extend @ ccmonster
[08:21:07] <bot-t> ccmonster, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[08:21:41] <ccmonster> I get that, but it doesn't appear to work correctly. Not sure what I am doing wrong. i've read the extend docs a few times.
[08:21:51] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2526882 , i added the logging, see what's happening.
[08:22:13] <ccmonster> the output of line 12 specifically.
[08:22:54] <kborchers> ccmonster: what you wrote in your question has extend(object, boolean, object) which is not correct
[08:23:03] <kborchers> your pastie on line 12 is return true;
[08:23:30] <ccmonster> refresh it, i think you have the old version
[08:23:35] <ccmonster> page.State = $.extend(true,{},st)
[08:23:42] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2526882
[08:23:43] <kborchers> sorry didn't see your other pastie
[08:23:50] <ccmonster> np
[08:25:01] <kborchers> not saying this will solve your issue but you should really use semicolons ... can cause unexpected behavior in certain circumstances without them
[08:25:35] <ccmonster> yea, i added those just after pasting. they are there in my working copy.
[08:25:40] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2526916 is the full obj.
[08:25:41] <ajpiano> ccmonster: also, $.extend will throw away values in objects that are undefined
[08:26:27] <ajpiano> also, is your intention to MODIFY the original ST object, or create a brand new, unrelated object that has the same properties initially but in no way references back
[08:26:28] <ccmonster> basically, i am in the middle of trying to get this page.State ironed out. I am trying all sorts of thigns to get the object consistent between state changes, and it's been very frustrating.
[08:27:29] <ccmonster> i deally, (and maybe this is more clear in the pastie i just posted), I am trying to hold a page.State obj as central object.
[08:27:46] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: you noticed the new(ish) _.defaults method, quite cool for such a common idiom now
[08:28:09] <ccmonster> Ive gotten myself down a rabbit hole, and am inbetween various things trying to fix it. can't say the code is very consistant at the moment, as im the middle of trying to debug/fix.
[08:28:24] <aaronmcadam> "Fill in missing properties in object with default values from the defaults objects. As soon as the property is filled, further defaults will have no effect."
[08:28:40] <ajpiano> whoa, i hadn't seen that aaronmcadam, that's legit
[08:28:42] <ploo> how do I grab all values from a form ?
[08:28:47] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#defaults
[08:28:49] <aaronmcadam> nice huh
[08:28:58] <aaronmcadam> I know it's easy to do, but just a nice to have
[08:29:00] <ajpiano> oh in underscore
[08:29:05] <aaronmcadam> yeah soz dude :D
[08:29:16] <ajpiano> i thought you meant in ui
[08:29:22] <aaronmcadam> ploo: see ?serialize and see ?serializeArray
[08:29:23] <bot-t> ploo, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[08:29:23] <bot-t> ploo, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[08:29:29] <ccmonster> does that make more sense? or put some context to my patched code?
[08:29:31] <aaronmcadam> oh sorry ajpiano :)
[08:29:58] <pachet> well you have your work cut out for you now ajpiano
[08:30:21] <see7di> jquery lead to memory growth.how can i?
[08:31:34] <aaronmcadam> do u think there'd be much adversity to add a clone of that method to jq ajpiano ?
[08:31:47] <ajpiano> i don't see why would add it
[08:31:56] <aaronmcadam> yeah?
[08:31:59] <vladikoff> see7di, yes can you
[08:32:09] <see7di> jquery lead to memory growth.who can help me?
[08:32:09] <aaronmcadam> in all my modules, I'm using extend based on defaults and options
[08:32:24] <aaronmcadam> console.profile see7di
[08:33:06] <Brodingo> ?eval growth.who
[08:33:07] <bot-t> Brodingo: ReferenceError: growth is not defined
[08:33:23] <see7di> how to do?
[08:33:44] <ccmonster> so if page.State.region = '', and st.region = 'us' , how do i get it to overwrite page.State.region in the extend because page.State = $.extend(true,{},st) does not appear to do it
[08:33:47] <Brodingo> how indeed
[08:34:19] <see7di> aaronmcadam how to do?
[08:34:37] <aaronmcadam> firebug api dood
[08:34:39] <aaronmcadam> simples
[08:34:46] <aaronmcadam> you just feed it whatever you want to profile
[08:34:50] <aaronmcadam> like a func or something like that
[08:34:58] <aaronmcadam> or wait no
[08:35:04] <aaronmcadam> you call it before your code block
[08:35:10] * ccmonster frustrated.
[08:35:12] <aaronmcadam> and then profileEnd() or something similar
[08:35:37] <ajpiano> ccmonster: are you actually...
[08:35:44] <ajpiano> assigning the result of the xtension BACK to page.State
[08:35:51] <ajpiano> yes
[08:35:53] <ajpiano> you are
[08:35:55] <ccmonster> ...
[08:36:29] <ajpiano> ?eval var page = { State: { region: "" } };  page.State = $.extend(true, {}, {region: "us"}); page.State
[08:36:30] <bot-t> ajpiano: {"region": "us"}
[08:36:32] <ajpiano> hmm
[08:36:35] <ajpiano> seems to work just fine :/
[08:36:48] <ccmonster> look at the pastie. i put the output there
[08:37:03] <aaronmcadam> see7di: http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API#console.profile.28.5Btitle.5D.29
[08:37:23] <ccmonster> it keeps showing up '', however, if i do the same thing but set it to var blah = $.extend(true,{},st); it works fine.
[08:37:29] <jedimind_> is there some reason $(this).parents('.container').hide(); would not find the .container parent and hide it ?
[08:37:33] <ccmonster> but it will not set for page.State
[08:38:04] <see7di> thank you ,i try it.
[08:38:48] <Kronuz> hello
[08:39:34] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2526916 shows the blah thing i am talking about.
[08:41:26] <Kronuz> hey, in using $.ajax() â€¦what data structure do I have to pass as `data` for it to convert it to "action=1&elms=a&elms=b&elms=c" ? I tried `data: {action:1, elms:['a','b','c']}` and `data: [{action:1},{elms:'a'},{elms:'b'},{elms:'c'}]` â€¦but none works
[08:41:43] <Kronuz> (without having to build the string myself, of course)
[08:44:28] <erichynds> Kronuz: $("form").serialize()
[08:45:13] <peterretief> hello all
[08:45:38] <peterretief> i am new to jquery and have a question related to json
[08:46:23] <peterretief> from this $(".description").text(data);
[08:46:34] <k4v> hi i try to hide a div that contains a form on the very top of the page. when i set height to 0, the content still overlaps the next div below...
[08:46:56] <peterretief> i get for instance {"amount": 126.66666666666664, "name": "Paw Paw"}
[08:47:18] <ccmonster> bah. i just dont get that page.State issue. Why it works with other obj, but not that one.
[08:47:35] <peterretief> i want to slice amount and name on my page but havent been ble to
[08:48:07] <pachet> ?hide() @ k4v

[08:48:43] <ccmonster> tofixed?
[08:48:44] <ccmonster> or something
[08:48:51] <imsky> peterretief: what's up?
[08:49:01] <peterretief> quicksilver: thanks
[08:49:05] <pachet> k4v: then it's a css issue, set overflow-y:hidden and the children won't spill out
[08:49:20] <k4v> pachel: ah that sounds cool
[08:49:32] <peterretief> thats so helpful
[08:49:37] <peterretief> thanks
[08:49:41] <quicksilver> welcome
[08:50:10] <peterretief> i couldnt get away from data["name"]
[08:50:34] <k4v> peterthies: that did it =)
[08:52:50] <ccmonster> I might go crazy lol. this is so frustrating. var blah = $.extend(true,{},st) works, but page.State = $.extend(true,{},st) does not. What is wrong there?
[08:54:42] <kborchers> ccmonster: i'm a bit stumped on that one. Just as something to try, have you tried setting a default for State: {} and then do $.extend(true, page.State, st); instead of setting it with the return value. shouldn't make a difference but something to try
[08:55:10] <ccmonster> sure. here is my latest pastie. I have sort of done that.
[08:56:20] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/2526916
[08:58:39] <ccmonster> you check it out kborchers ?
[09:00:16] <ccmonster> that was quite the split. yikes
[09:01:22] <kborchers> ccmonster: i don't see where you "have sort of done that"
[09:01:34] <ccmonster> i initialized the page.State = {}
[09:02:38] <ccmonster> and commented out the page.State =, and put your line in there
[09:02:42] <ccmonster> hit refresh perhaps?
[09:03:50] <kborchers> ccmonster: gotcha, needed a refresh ... if that still doesn't work, i'm out of ideas ... maybe set var blah = $.extend(...) then page.State = blah;  stupid but worth a shot
[09:08:23] <bradleymeck> is there a way to call .button() on a node that has not been placed in the dom yet?
[09:08:55] <ajpiano> bradleymeck: pretty much nope
[09:09:04] <ajpiano> i don't think it'll paint correclty unless it's in the domzor
[09:12:57] <jedimind_> ajpiano, but what if i want the user to click on a button that is not in the dom ?
[09:13:18] <ajpiano> thats clearly not the usecase he's trying to support :)
[09:13:25] <danagin> I have an img, within an asp reapeater, in a usercontrol that I'm trying to get $('img').click(function() { work on. Any help?
[09:14:39] <danagin> whois danagin
[09:15:07] <jedimind_> danagin, $('img').live('click', function() { ... } )
[09:17:00] <danagin> i love you
[09:17:10] <danagin> lol
[09:17:24] <danagin> ive been looking for that, I'm a total nub w/jq
[09:17:51] <Dave_Stein> if .live works that means the image is in the DOM :)
[09:18:30] <jedimind_> Dave_Stein, but may not have been on document.ready
[09:18:48] <Dave_Stein> ah ok, arrived mid-question
[09:18:53] <jedimind_> :)
[09:37:48] <danagin> Now I have a div element, within an asp reapeater, in a usercontrol. I'm trying to toggle additional data that is within the item repeater. $(this).parent().find("div.Details").hide("slow"); makes the additional information do a screen twitch, but nothing goes anywhere
[09:38:43] <danagin> if it were toggle, I would think it was being triggered twice for some reason, but even with hide, just a twitch
[09:40:09] <danagin> if I set css to hidden for details, and show in the jq, it twitches outward. In other words, you can begin to see the very top of the div in the twitch
[09:42:04] <jacof> Who knows any good scripts for image thumbling and carousel like this one: http://finnrudolph.de/ImageFlow
[09:47:04] <Brodingo> jacof http://addyosmani.com/blog/jqueryuicoverflow/
[09:51:36] <danagin> Let me refrase the question without so much detail. I have a $(this).parent().find("div.Details").hide("slow"); that will cause an "annimation jump". It will begin to hide for a part of a second but it is more of a twich and never hides. ideas?
[09:52:31] <king313> guys, im a jquery newbie
[09:52:51] <danagin> quit now while you have the chance
[09:52:56] <king313> to work with jquery, something more than /js/ files (jquery-1.6.2.min.js and jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js) is needed?
[09:52:58] <danagin> jk, me too
[09:53:22] <danagin> there is a good tut on w3schools that will get you started
[09:54:03] <pachet> ccmonster: still having trouble?
[09:54:16] <kborchers> do not use w3schools!!! http://w3fools.com
[09:54:22] <danagin> ?
[09:54:38] <kborchers> king313: you need the css for UI
[09:55:47] <king313> so development-bundle is uneeded
[09:55:49] <king313> thanks!
[10:00:34] <danagin> this maybe a dumb question. I have a div that I'm trying to expand(where I'm having the twitch issue). It would actually be nicer if I could pop over the screen with the div section.
[10:01:28] <acalbaza> what is the proper way to define private instance variables in a plugin?  i thought i was on the right track with var = xxx within my function($){;} but my variables get stomped on when i make a 2nd call to my plugin
[10:01:35] <danagin> I think that would sove my twitch issue as well, it's probably something else on the page causing this.
[10:03:13] <acalbaza> http://pastebin.com/F40sSFT1
[10:04:34] <MoTiOnXml> acalbaza: you should just store the vars on the widget-instance itself
[10:05:09] <MoTiOnXml> acalbaza: or in the widget use this.element.data
[10:05:48] <ccmonster> yea, so Im still stumped with this page.State stuff. I really am struggling with this, and It is very odd.
[10:11:12] <ProLoser|Work> hello
[10:11:14] <snagnever> hi! i have a doubt: i have a function as an attribute of a onclick event, as: <a onclick="return fun()">. how can i get the click event inside de function?
[10:12:20] <ProLoser|Work> fun(e)
[10:12:22] <ProLoser|Work> iunno
[10:12:33] <ProLoser|Work> you could just bind stuff using .click() like you're supposed to do
[10:33:20] <drd> stupid question, maybe? i want to find out if either the root or any of the child elements in a wrapped set matches a selector, .has() and .is() don't seem to be doing it
[10:33:36] <drd> eg, $('<div class="foo"></div>').has('.foo') == false
[10:34:01] <drd> but $('<div class="bar"><div class="foo"></div></div>').has('.foo) == true
[10:34:12] <drd> i'd like something that's true in both cases?
[10:34:34] <mfilipe> hi! how do I do find out if there is a element in dom?
[10:35:53] <niftylettuce> any pros here wanna rewrite raptorize with mediaelementjs?
[10:38:54] <muzone_> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/cbbU9/ - why does my dropdown menu go behind the hot chick? I even set its z-index to 100!
[10:41:32] <ccmonster> lol, this sucks
[10:42:08] <muzone_> ccmonster: What sucks?
[10:42:13] <kborchers> muzone_: because your z-index still isn't high enough to be above what ever z-index is applied by that plugin you're using
[10:42:20] <ccmonster> my code, and this statechange piece im doing.
[10:42:29] <ccmonster> i cant, for the life of me, get this obj to work right.
[10:42:53] <muzone_> kborchers: I tried setting the z-index to 1000 too without it changing a thing.
[10:43:05] <kborchers> i set it to 10000000 and it worked ;)
[10:43:12] <muzone_> hehehe
[10:43:36] <muzone_> imma fucking email the author
[10:43:39] <muzone_> this is unacceptable
[10:44:16] <ccmonster> lol.
[10:44:34] <ccmonster> kborchers, I cannot seem to get it to work. im banging my head against the wall lol.
[10:44:39] <ccmonster> its very odd, as you saw.
[10:45:01] <kborchers> ccmonster: i know, i'm out of ideas on that one
[10:45:28] <ccmonster> basically, I need the state to be set correctly, with error checking on page load, but then on state change, I need the same load function to load a page.
[10:45:38] <ccmonster> i think the 'signals' are crossed somewhere.
[10:47:26] <jinxdone> muzone_; set position: relative and high enough z-index for the #main_menu
[10:48:13] <muzone_> jinxdone: No need for the position: relative; though - it has to be absolute for some other reasons.
[10:48:39] <ProLoser|Work> you can do if x == y in jquery templates right?
[10:53:03] <mlweber> If I use an bind an event to an class, how can I manipulate the exact object that triggers the event?
[10:53:48] <mlweber> Does that make sense?
[10:54:08] <jinxdone> event.target or event.originalTarget
[10:54:34] <mlweber> Perfect, thanks jinxdone
[10:56:39] <Jobbe> Got a problem with Jplayer, i've modified an example, to use a shout cast stream, it works on my iPhone - but not on my macbook, nor android device - even though they write on their website it's compatible - source code: http://pastebin.com/5UWJDa9q - any ideas where i screw up?
[10:58:07] <acalbaza> so, is (function($){var a = 'foo';})... effectively creating a singleton?
[10:59:07] <Jobbe> Got a live example here http://mobil.partyzone.nu/devtest/
[11:01:21] <tbranyen> acalbaza: no
[11:01:44] <tbranyen> acalbaza: i think you mean (function($) { var a = 'foo'; })(this.jQuery);
[11:02:14] <rosieres> Jobbe: use jsfiddle.net . . . makes debugging more flexible
[11:03:03] <Jobbe> rosieres: my source code is in one file?
[11:04:25] <rosieres> Jobbe: I guess your problem is that the flash file doesn´t know wapt to do with the stream address . . .   on iphone you run on html5 i guess. . .
[11:04:54] <Jobbe> rosieres: so it could be the stream source that should be changed?
[11:06:04] <rosieres> Jobbe: maybe . . .
[11:06:13] <Jobbe> rosieres: hmm ok
[11:06:34] <Jobbe> I've used an AAC and MP3 stream, should be working though
[11:06:35] <rosieres> perhaps check the fla file and review the code . . .
[11:06:47] <Jobbe> rosieres: i have no experience in flash
[11:06:57] <rosieres> Jobbe: does it work with a flat mp3 file ?
[11:07:02] <Jobbe> yes
[11:07:38] <Jobbe> actually
[11:07:43] <Jobbe> then it uses an m4a file
[11:07:46] <Jobbe> and ogg
[11:07:50] <Jobbe> for default playback
[11:07:50] <Rushing> i used to be able to test if(typeof console === "undefined"), but it looks like chrome says it's undefined even when i have it open
[11:07:56] <ravenzz> Jobbe http://www.longtailvideo.com/players/jw-flv-player/ give it a try
[11:07:59] <guy> I was pretty sure jquery can make crossdomain GET requests to get content. Now, can't it?
[11:08:15] <Rushing> anyone know the best way to test if the console exists? i seem to remember if(!console) not working in older versions of IE
[11:08:23] <ravenzz> guy you can't, just JSONP
[11:08:32] <Jobbe> ravenzz: hmm can it run in the background?
[11:08:50] <ravenzz> Jobbe what do you mean with background?
[11:09:01] <ajpiano> Rushing: window.console
[11:09:32] <Jobbe> ravenzz: i'm developing a web player - and don't want a default player design, got a finished design for the player - just need to get the technology that should stream the music working
[11:09:51] <Rushing> ahh thanks ajpiano
[11:10:15] <ravenzz> yep you can create your own skin, or interact with it through its js api
[11:10:37] <Jobbe> hmm ok
[11:10:52] <Jobbe> i'll take a look at it - thanks
[11:11:59] <ravenzz> Jobbe http://goo.gl/L4dyJ
[11:13:02] <Jobbe> thanks ravenzz
[11:14:43] <ccmonster> ok, wow, so mind blown in a whole new way.
[11:15:23] <rosieres> does anybody know how I can change the jquery Version from an inline script ?
[11:32:10] <Jobbe> ravenzz: got jw player working - on my iPhone ...
[11:32:25] <Jobbe> with the arc plugin, could not get it working with the mp3 stream
[11:32:34] <eTiger13> ugh i hate articles like this http://www.artefactgroup.com/#/content/want-a-faster-html5-webapp-dont-use-jquery
[11:32:35] <Jobbe> arc = aac
[11:33:44] <Jobbe> eTiger13: "On mobile devices the performance can be unacceptably slow." - thats why we have jQuery mobile
[11:34:17] <eTiger13> Jobbe: you do know that jqm uses jquery core right?
[11:34:36] <ravenzz> :p
[11:34:40] <Jobbe> eTiger13: could figure it used query ;)
[11:34:43] <Jobbe> jquery
[11:35:13] <Jobbe> ravenzz: that jw player said something abobut cross domain something when i used the mp3 stream
[11:35:20] <ravenzz> an image could be much more heavy than jquery
[11:35:57] <ravenzz> Jobbe yep you should take care of those restrictions if you are going to use flash one
[11:35:57] <danzik17> eTiger13: Is it ironic that the article railing against jQuery is in fact using jQuery?
[11:36:12] <Jobbe> ravenzz:  so that restriction could be my problem then
[11:36:14] <ravenzz> because of flash security restrictions
[11:36:18] <Jobbe> ahh
[11:36:27] <Jobbe> think i read that somewhere on the player site
[11:36:44] <Jobbe> ravenzz: yea http://www.jplayer.org/latest/developer-guide/#jPlayer-flash-security
[11:37:01] <ijames-cars> I'm looking into form validation for jQuery Mobile.  there's the validate plugin.  Is that a good choice for mobile?
[11:37:51] <ravenzz> Jobbe anyway It could be nice to setting up an crossdomain.xml to allow just your own domain to stream it
[11:37:58] <ravenzz> (sorry for my english)
[11:38:12] <ccmonster> anyone have experience with History.js?
[11:38:40] <Jobbe> ravenzz: no problem, and yeah - but i think it might become a problem, since the code that runs at that stream server is coded into the stream executable ..
[11:38:50] <ravenzz> because if the client's browser doesn't support html5, it will shot a flash player
[11:38:58] <Jobbe> ravenzz: yeah
[11:39:12] <Jobbe> but it did work on safari some time ago, and now it dont
[11:39:25] <Jobbe> ravenzz: think i could use that mention "System.security.allowDomain('*')" to anything?
[11:40:07] <Jobbe> ravenzz: or is that what should be in the crossdomain.xml file?
[11:40:36] <ravenzz> Jobbe http://goo.gl/duv9y
[11:41:22] <Jobbe> ravenzz: thanks, that should be placed on the stream server, right?
[11:41:58] <ravenzz> yes
[11:44:17] <Jobbe> ravenzz: thanks for the help, i'll take a look at it later! - now it's bedtime!
[11:45:31] <ravenzz> nite
[11:49:02] <ccmonster> so hows everyone../

[11:49:19] <ravenzz> lol
[11:51:55] <schz> hey everyone, i have a question about selectors - i have a selector that looks like this : $(".checkbox:checked:not(.SD_CONTROLLER)")
[11:52:21] <schz> i would like to add one more not() clause to it - i need it to not be class SD_CONTROLLER and also not be class ALL_GROUPS
[11:52:25] <schz> how can i do that ?
[11:54:30] <danzik17> schz: Something like $('.checkbox).filter( function() { var $this = $(this); return this.checked && !$this.hasClass('SD_CONTROLLER') && !$this.hasClass('ALL_GROUPS')l  });
[11:55:46] <schz> danzik17 thanks - that worked
[11:56:44] <feathersanddown> Doing a  $('input:radio[name=radio_group]:checked').val() only return "on" , how can I get the real value from selected radio button ?
[11:58:19] <GeO2> Hi
[11:58:36] <GeO2> I got an issue with jScrollPane and draggable elements inside the panel
[11:58:58] <GeO2> I can move them out, but they'll stay behind the other elements although their zindex is higher
[12:01:02] <GeO2> It's exactly this problem actually : http://markmail.org/message/a6tegnr6hkcmn5re  but appendTo doesn't help

[12:20:08] <Connor_> Hey guys. I have a question. If I want to use setInterval to call a function every 50 milliseconds but I want it to call if the previous call has finished or not, is a simple setInterval the best way to do it?
[12:20:52] <Connor_> I saw in Paul irish's video that using (function(){//stuff})() was a better way to do setInterval if you want to make sure the previous call has finished
[12:28:45] <eTiger13> dont use setinterval
[12:28:55] <eTiger13> oh wait, your use case is fine
[12:29:08] <kpettit> I've got any array  var map = { foo : 'bar'};  what is the best way to merge that array with another one, overwritting previous value for foo?
[12:29:13] <eTiger13> but do you really want it to run if the last iteration hasn't ran yet?
[12:29:35] <eTiger13> kpettit: you could look at $.extend()
[12:30:16] <kpettit> I've been looking at that one.  DOesn't it just add, not replace?
[12:30:34] <kpettit> I'll play with it a bit and see what happens though.  Thanks for the pointer.
[12:31:41] <eTiger13> kpettit: no, it replaces as well. its how most plugins extend default options
[12:31:49] <kpettit> Cool, thanks.

[12:44:00] <webguynow> I have a validation function for my form inside $(function() {} but it's not getting called
[12:44:13] <webguynow> do I need to do something particular
[12:44:16] <eTiger13> webguynow: how are you trying to call it?
[12:44:24] <danagin> I have a usercontrol that is loaded, I want the equivilant to $(document).ready for the usercontrol
[12:44:25] <webguynow> use this format ?
[12:44:28] <webguynow> var myfx = function(params)
[12:44:30] <danagin> idea?
[12:44:46] <eTiger13> ?pe @ webguynow
[12:44:46] <bot-t> webguynow, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[12:45:00] <eTiger13> danagin: what do you mean?
[12:45:34] <danagin> well, the usercontrol loads some information, once that information is completely loaded, I want to trigger
[12:45:34] <Sample> Q: If i do var form = $('form').... is it more efficient to in the future do "form.attr('id');" over $(form).attr('id');" ? I'm just curious if the first is simply USING the object, while the second is trying to perform another search again or having some additional overhead
[12:45:46] <pputman> Hi.  I'm writing a forum in rails, and trying to learn javascript/jquery, any ideas on what I can add to the forum to practice javascript/jquery?
[12:46:23] <eddiemonge> danagin: like .load?
[12:46:30] <danagin> I'm fairly new to all of this, I just don't know what would be $(usercontrol).ready
[12:46:36] <eddiemonge> ?load
[12:46:37] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[12:47:10] <eddiemonge> Sample: $form[0].id
[12:47:29] <webguynow> bot-t:
[12:47:39] <webguynow> bot-t: will paste code in a bit
[12:47:40] <eddiemonge> Sample: and yes it would be faster to use $form as it caches $('form') to avoid expensive repeat lookups
[12:47:40] <bot-t> webguynow, .html() - Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[12:47:45] <danagin> nice ty!
[12:47:55] <eddiemonge> webguynow: you know bot-t is a bot right?
[12:48:02] <eddiemonge> i love you bot-t
[12:48:02] <bot-t> no you don't
[12:48:05] <eddiemonge> yes i do
[12:48:19] <webguynow> was curious if I'm using jQuery does every fx have to be inside $(function() {}
[12:48:43] <webguynow> and are both these formats allowed inside  $(function() {}
[12:49:08] <webguynow> var myfx = function(params)
[12:49:13] <webguynow> function myfx(params)
[12:49:32] <eddiemonge> webguynow: no but it should be so it runs when the dom is ready. $(function() {}); is shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {});
[12:49:59] <eddiemonge> as for your second question yes both are allowed as that is pure javascript. it just differs how you are going to use those
[12:52:32] <jugstah> are we split?
[12:53:46] <jugstah> hmm
[12:55:21] <Connor_> I have a question abour writing plugins
[12:55:25] <Connor_> Should I use this template:
[12:55:46] <Connor_> One sec :P
[12:56:26] <Connor_> Sorry was asking the wrong question
[12:56:59] <Connor_> I currently have this: http://pastebin.com/t9Lw3zh8
[12:57:15] <Connor_> Ignore the synatx error on line 16
[12:57:17] <Connor_> 17*
[12:57:34] <Connor_> Should I put the calculateInitial function inside return this.each(function(){})?
[12:57:53] <Connor_> Or a better question is what exactlly does this.each do
[12:57:56] <Connor_> I can't figure that bit out
[12:59:18] <datarecall> How would i go about adding an li to a ul but to the start of the ul not the end like append
[12:59:38] <jugstah> how does one detect a group of radio buttons and find which one has been 'checked'?
[13:01:15] <WarDekar> does $(window).load() not work in CHrome?
[13:01:29] <WarDekar> i'm having significant issues with getitng it to work
[13:01:34] <sphinxxx> whats not working
[13:01:39] <Connor_> $(window).load works fine in chrome
[13:01:41] <WarDekar> well it just doesn't work
[13:02:29] <Connor_> Can you pastebin some code?
[13:03:27] <Connor_> @jugstah, $('input:checkbox').attr('checked');
[13:03:31] <Connor_> Returns if it is checked or not
[13:03:35] <Connor_> I think
[13:03:39] <WarDekar> $(window).load(function() { alert('asdf'); });
[13:03:42] <WarDekar> i don't get an alert...
[13:03:58] <eddiemonge> ?ready @ WarDekar
[13:03:59] <bot-t> WarDekar, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[13:04:16] <sphinxxx> but it works in other browsers?
[13:04:34] <Connor_> http://jsfiddle.net/xRagM/
[13:04:35] <Connor_> Works fine there
[13:04:57] <WarDekar> i was reading about jquery performance tricks and one was to initialize jquery stuff on window load instead of doc ready
[13:05:07] <Connor_> Depends on what you are doing
[13:05:15] <Connor_> If you need to alter images or media then window(load) is better
[13:05:16] <sphinxxx> use load for stuff that needs to wait for all images to load
[13:05:19] <Connor_> Or in some case required
[13:05:30] <Connor_> Otherwise document.ready is fine
[13:05:39] <WarDekar> i just want the page to appear to the user faster
[13:06:14] <jugstah> does this look legit: $("input[name='applicant_rent_own'").change(function(){
[13:06:23] <Connor_> It's not really loading faster, just loading further down the queue
[13:06:33] <WarDekar> i realize that
[13:06:38] <Connor_> It does Jugstah
[13:06:41] <WarDekar> but to the user it appears faster which is what matters
[13:07:05] <jugstah> any user doesnt care how fast it loads as long as it works and runs like its supposed to...
[13:07:13] <jugstah> look at all them frontierville people bitching :-D
[13:07:22] <jugstah> *flees*
[13:07:38] <Connor_> Put it in document.ready and all JS code in the footer
[13:07:45] <Connor_> Unless you are altering/finding images
[13:07:48] <Connor_> Then use window.load
[13:07:50] <Connor_> That is the standard
[13:07:52] <Connor_> And works well
[13:08:16] <jugstah> ok my line fires.. now i need to detect which radio button was selected by 'value'
[13:08:44] <Connor_> can't you do $(this) inside the change bind?
[13:08:47] <ricardo_bb|home> hi
[13:08:49] <eddiemonge> jugstah: no
[13:08:54] <Connor_> Wouldn't that return the object that has been changed
[13:09:04] <eddiemonge> $('input[name="applicant_rent_own"]
[13:09:08] <eddiemonge> $('input[name="applicant_rent_own"]')
[13:09:13] <eddiemonge> you forgot the closing ]
[13:09:23] <ricardo_bb|home> some here up for it to help a little open source projekt
[13:09:30] <Connor_> Depends what project
[13:09:48] <ricardo_bb|home> icinga
[13:09:57] <ricardo_bb|home> icinga.org
[13:11:59] <jugstah> eddie- whoops... good catch...
[13:13:38] <jugstah> will i get banned for pasting one line of code in here?
[13:14:02] <jugstah> actually, apaprently not cuz i didnt get kicked
[13:14:24] <xckpd7> anyone use PubSub and have a little insight as to the benefits of using it?
[13:14:39] <Connor_> Does .find return false if it dosen't find anything?
[13:14:53] <xckpd7> I'm looking for a more modular approach to jQuery..
[13:14:59] <eddiemonge> Connor_: no. it returns nothing
[13:15:05] <Connor_> Hm strange
[13:15:15] <Connor_> http://jsfiddle.net/eg2xt/
[13:15:27] <Connor_> "Object false has no method 'attr'
[13:15:28] <Connor_> "
[13:15:28] <ricardo_bb|home> Connor_: not interested?
[13:15:39] <Connor_> Don't think so sorry :(
[13:16:26] <Connor_> Oh I know why
[13:16:30] <Connor_> Im an idiot
[13:17:21] <Birliban> hi, is there any jquery plugin to display json data dynamically as a grid. just as raw as the firebug console.table e.g.
[13:18:17] <Connor_> Not sure sorr
[13:18:17] <Connor_> y
[13:18:43] <eddiemonge> Connor_: why not use .width and .height ?
[13:19:12] <Connor_> This is true
[13:19:39] <eddiemonge> Connor_: and this isnt what you think it is in that function
[13:19:59] <Connor_> How do you mean?
[13:20:02] <Connor_> Update btw: http://jsfiddle.net/eg2xt/1/
[13:21:52] <eddiemonge> do a console.log(this) inside of the function
[13:22:01] <eddiemonge> this does not stay the same everywhere in the plugin
[13:22:07] <beefman> what determines "success" for a getJSON call?
[13:22:37] <Connor_> Oh
[13:22:39] <Connor_> I see what you mean
[13:22:47] <Connor_> Should I pass this through as an argument then?
[13:22:53] <ricardo_bb|home> any ideas how to find someone experienced in jquery with a bit spare time to help an open source projekt???
[13:23:12] <smplstk> what's a 'projekt'?
[13:23:24] <ricardo_bb|home> project
[13:23:31] <smplstk> OIC
[13:23:41] <ricardo_bb|home> sorry "german mode"
[13:23:58] <smplstk> sorry, jerkface mode :|
[13:25:00] * jugstah is away. Automatically set away [SZon]
[13:27:02] <ricardo_bb|home> no, yes, maybe?
[13:28:26] <ricardo_bb|home> want to get rid of mootools, but have no clue how to write this in jquery: http://pastebin.com/QcCBkUMa
[13:28:30] <eddiemonge> Connor_: options.element isnt available yet since you are calling it in its definition parent
[13:28:51] <Connor_> Of course
[13:28:54] <Connor_> Damn
[13:28:56] <beefman> for this function, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/     how do i look at the value it retrieves?
[13:29:21] <Connor_> So shoudl I calculate that option and then extend it into optins object after?
[13:30:04] <eddiemonge> Connor_: or do it after
[13:30:29] <eddiemonge> beefman: function (data) { data is json
[13:30:41] <Connor_> Okay cool
[13:30:43] <Connor_> I shall try that!
[13:30:58] <Connor_> Also, you can do .succes and .error after getJSON() @beefman
[13:31:02] <Connor_> success*
[13:31:23] <beefman> eddiemonge: i'm not familiar enough with it to understand the first answer
[13:31:28] <Connor_> So $().getJSON(stuff for json).success( do something on success).error( do somethingo n error);
[13:32:37] <beefman> if i have $.getJSON(foo, bar, baz);    then to look at the returned data i replace baz with alert(data.toSource())?
[13:33:02] <Connor_> bar would be
[13:33:09] <Connor_> function(data) { alert(data); }
[13:33:13] <Connor_> And it will alter all the data
[13:33:16] <Connor_> Or console.log
[13:33:20] <Connor_> Is better than alter :)
[13:33:24] <Connor_> alert*
[13:33:33] <beefman> the page says the second parameter is what gets sent to the server, not what comes back
[13:33:43] <Connor_> Sorry 3rd :P
[13:33:51] <beefman> this page: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[13:33:53] <beefman> ok
[13:33:59] <Connor_> The argument data in that function will be the data recieved
[13:34:00] <eddiemonge> $.getJSON(url, dataToServer, function(data) { function to handle returned data })
[13:34:16] <Renegade001> Does anyone know a good plugin to sort lists via a textbox?
[13:34:21] <eddiemonge> or $.getJSON(url, function(data) { function to handle returned data })
[13:34:29] <beefman> ok so $.getJSON(url, foo, function(data){alert(data.toSource());});
[13:34:32] <Renegade001> Like, user inputs words into textbox and lists sorts automatically
[13:34:47] <Connor_> Correct beefman
[13:34:55] <beefman> ok let me try it
[13:35:01] <Connor_> Wait
[13:35:04] <Connor_> Whats .toSource()
[13:35:15] <beefman> lets you print an object as text
[13:35:24] <Connor_> Ah kai
[13:37:28] <beefman> ok nothing is happening.  if i use $.getJSON(url, datatoserver, alert('foo')); it alerts with foo, but $.getJSON(url, datatoserver, function(data) { alert('foo'); }); does nothing
[13:37:42] <beefman> firebug says both gets have status 200
[13:37:45] <tbranyen> beefman: umm
[13:37:53] <tbranyen> if you do alert('foo') that immediately executes
[13:38:01] <tbranyen> do function() { alert('foo'); }
[13:38:07] <tbranyen> and you'll find it will not execute probably
[13:38:10] <tbranyen> oh i see
[13:38:16] <tbranyen> thats your second example :-)
[13:38:18] <beefman> that's what i'm asking...
[13:38:21] <beefman> :)
[13:38:26] <tbranyen> well i mean it proves nothing to have just an alert
[13:38:34] <tbranyen> beefman: attach to the error callback
[13:38:39] <tbranyen> are you doing cross domain?
[13:38:43] <beefman> why shouldn't they both do the same thing?
[13:38:50] <tbranyen> because thats not how javascript works
[13:38:52] <beefman> what's cross domain?
[13:39:01] <tbranyen> ?SOP
[13:39:01] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[13:39:12] <infid> hey, when i create a jquery mobile sample page, none of my header/content/footer is styled. even though it's linking locally my downloaded version of jquery mobile .css and .js, yet it works fine when i do it from the CDN version. Any idea why?
[13:39:26] <beefman> no they're both from and to localhost
[13:39:27] <tbranyen> beefman: attach to error anyways
[13:39:28] <infid> my references to my relative/local jquery mobile files aren't 404'ing
[13:39:34] <Connor_> Do $.getJSON(url, datatoserver, function(data) { alert('foo'); }).error(alert(jqXHR););
[13:39:40] <tbranyen> $.getJSON(...).error(function() { console.log(this, arguments); })
[13:39:46] <tbranyen> Connor_: that won't work
[13:40:08] <tbranyen> you're passing undefined which is the return value of alert
[13:40:09] <tbranyen> to error
[13:40:14] <tbranyen> not a function reference
[13:40:42] <jugstah> does this look correct?
[13:40:45] <beefman> can you explain what that's doing?
[13:40:48] <jugstah> if (($('input[name="applicant_rent_own"]').val() == 'Rent') || ($('input[name="applicant_rent_own"]').val() == 'Own'))
[13:42:25] <beefman> it tells me $.getJSON(....).error is not a function
[13:42:27] <eddiemonge> jugstah: you should really be caching that value
[13:42:55] <jugstah> hmm this isnt firing
[13:43:11] <Connor_> @eddimonge http://pastebin.com/ahAb0mBq any better?
[13:43:27] <Connor_> Do I need an else in ternary operators?
[13:43:32] <Connor_> Or is that optional :/
[13:43:35] <GeO2> I got a A element, and I want to move it to another position, with Animate()
[13:43:42] <jugstah> eddie- gnarf told me exactly that yesterday.. i'll do that AFTER i got everything working...
[13:43:48] <jugstah> http://jsfiddle.net/jugstah/y3rvS/1/
[13:43:52] <jugstah> if anyone wants to take a peep
[13:43:55] <GeO2> but if I specify the left/top coordinates the movement is just a translation, how could I make it like a curv e?
[13:44:31] <jugstah> and before anyone asks about the .change(); in the last line, its because when the page loads, the value might be set already
[13:44:36] <jugstah> so need to trigger.
[13:44:43] <dr34mc0d3r> what defines a $getJSON.error ? if the return isnt JSON ?
[13:44:53] <eddiemonge> jugstah: start using jshint.com or jslint.com
[13:44:59] <beefman> tbranyen: ping
[13:45:05] <tbranyen> beefman: what up
[13:45:19] <beefman> it says $.getJSON(...).error is not a function
[13:45:20] <tbranyen> dr34mc0d3r: getJSON returns a jqXHR object
[13:45:25] <jugstah> eddie- i know im new.. i use the jslint in my notepad.. that's only cut n paste into jsfiddler :-)
[13:45:28] <tbranyen> beefman: get a newer version of jquery
[13:45:33] <jugstah> notepad++
[13:45:37] <tbranyen> something in the 1.5 range
[13:45:51] <eddiemonge> Connor_: you need the else and you forgot the options.initialWidth part
[13:46:04] <eddiemonge> you dont need the extend part
[13:46:24] <Connor_> Even if I want to merge it with the options object?
[13:46:29] <Connor_> Oh wait
[13:46:34] <Connor_> Does it just replace the value?
[13:46:40] <Connor_> If I did options.initialWidth = 500;
[13:47:01] <eddiemonge> options.initialWidth = options.initialWidth || calculateInitial(this, 'width')
[13:47:15] <Connor_> Much simpler :P
[13:47:19] <Connor_> Thanks :D
[13:47:29] <jugstah> learn something new every day
[13:48:48] <eddiemonge> GeO2: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2240052/how-would-you-animate-something-so-that-it-follows-a-curve
[13:49:07] <eddiemonge> Connor_: replace the this with $elements though
[13:49:29] <Connor_> Okie
[13:50:18] <jugstah> hmm this isnt firing
[13:51:05] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ jugstah
[13:51:05] <bot-t> jugstah, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[13:51:16] <jugstah> http://jsfiddle.net/jugstah/y3rvS/3/
[13:53:16] <Birliban> i want to display lot of different json data in grids, like firebug console.table, is there a dynamic and short way (maybe plugin) to solve this with jquery?
[13:56:29] <jugstah> eddie- did you take a look?
[13:56:56] <beefman> tbranyen: got the new jquery (1.6.4), now the error saying $.getJSON(...).error is not a function is gone, but nothing is in the error console
[13:57:58] <beefman> ahh!  yes it worked
[13:57:59] <beefman> ty
[13:58:48] <sphinxxx> how do i efficiently check if any span in the document has a certain class
[13:59:00] <sphinxxx> or , any span within a form tag
[13:59:12] <beefman> tbranyen: now next question, is it possible to alter the response text?
[13:59:37] <beefman> i'm using drupal and civicrm and drupal's devel module wants to put some garbage at the end of the json object
[13:59:41] <beefman> i want to prune it off
[13:59:53] <Connor_> if($('span').hasClass('myclass').length != -1) {}
[13:59:58] <Connor_> Will check if any in document has one
[14:00:03] <Connor_> And from there you can do
[14:00:13] <Connor_> $('span').each(function() { do stuff! });
[14:00:37] <Connor_> If there are multiple spans ofc
[14:00:56] <Connor_> Otherwise you can just select $('span.myclass')
[14:01:20] <eddiemonge> jugstah: looking
[14:01:53] <eddiemonge> Connor_: hasClass should not have a .length
[14:02:10] <eddiemonge> http://api.jquery.com/hasclass
[14:02:14] <Connor_> Oh yeah
[14:02:33] <Connor_> Okay, so just if($('span.myclass').length != 1)
[14:02:39] <Connor_> I believe
[14:02:42] <Connor_> Probably wrong again :P
[14:02:59] <jugstah> connor- someone in here told me there are many ways to skin a cat, even if some of them are wrong
[14:03:02] <jugstah> :-)
[14:03:13] <Connor_> I learn from it, its good :P
[14:03:30] <Connor_> I get to abuse the knowledge of people :d
[14:03:31] <Connor_> :D
[14:03:45] <jugstah> gnarf abused me a little yesterday but i learned from it
[14:03:48] <eddiemonge> jugstah: http://jsfiddle.net/y3rvS/5/
[14:03:50] <jugstah> he abused me on 'caching' :-)
[14:04:16] <Connor_> @edditmonge, you know PHP. Want to do something you can do in that, in jQuery
[14:04:26] <Connor_> you know PHP should be a question, not a statement :P
[14:04:45] <WebDragon> http://caffegelato.client-proof.com/contact/  in the center of the page is another copy of the social media icons -- what I'd like to do is have the icon show the hovered effect even if you're hovering the link next to it -- how do I tie the two together
[14:04:54] <eddiemonge> sphinxxx: if ( $('form').find('span.class').length ) { do something }
[14:04:58] <Connor_> Want to declare a variable and then use that variable as a function reference
[14:05:12] <eddiemonge> sphinxxx: or if you want to use it $('form').find('span.class').doStuff()
[14:05:15] <jugstah> eddie- thanks, i'll try that.. i ran it on jsfiddle but got nothing back but i'll try it on my code
[14:05:24] <jugstah> eddie- much appreciated
[14:05:33] <eddiemonge> jugstah: click the buttons
[14:05:46] <eddiemonge> triggering change was screwing you up because it would trigger all of them
[14:06:37] <Connor_> @WebDragon have the same class on both of them and then bind that class on hover to change color/background-image?
[14:06:41] <jugstah> eddie- suppose someone goes to page 2 from page 3(on a submit).. will this fire? cuz i need these rules applied depending on what's set?
[14:06:55] <jugstah> thats why i had a .change(); trigger on the end
[14:07:17] <WebDragon> Connor_: no because the sprite is only on the one <a> not both
[14:07:52] <WebDragon> and the class on the one gives it height/width to cover the sprite
[14:08:46] <Connor_> $('span.social_icon').hover(function() { $(this).next('a').css('color': '#bada55'); });
[14:08:49] <jugstah> eddie- you rock.. thanks!!!
[14:09:01] <Connor_> As long as next() dosen't count children
[14:09:04] <Connor_> That I am not sure on
[14:09:27] <WebDragon> wait, I can $("p.icon_text.sprited").hover( function {} { $(this).find("a").trigger(hover) }); ?
[14:09:30] <eddiemonge> jugstah: your question didnt make sense to me
[14:09:40] <Connor_> Not quite
[14:09:45] <Connor_> Or actually
[14:09:46] <Connor_> m
[14:09:52] <WebDragon> this would trigger the hover effect on both a's contiained in the p
[14:09:59] <WebDragon> contained*
[14:10:04] <jugstah> eddie- i have a multipage loan form.. on the first page, they would select a certain type of loan
[14:10:16] <Connor_> Try that, looks like I could work yes
[14:10:18] <Connor_> Not sure though
[14:10:22] <jugstah> if they were getting like 'second mortgage', they were required to own the property
[14:10:43] <jugstah> so i needed to trigger to set the radio button()already done) and then apply the rules
[14:10:49] <jugstah> for anotehr field below
[14:10:49] <gnarf> I don't think u can trigger hover... webdragon
[14:11:02] <gnarf> Mouseenter maybe
[14:11:08] <WebDragon> checking the apidocs
[14:11:11] <jugstah> gnarf- eddie admonished me on caching too :-)
[14:11:11] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: wtf, why dont you just do it the easier way and put the span IN the anchor tag?
[14:11:25] <WebDragon> it's the idea that counts, not the implementation -- I'll figger out the implementation
[14:11:44] <jugstah> crap, I gotta go.. catch you guys later
[14:11:48] <WebDragon> eddiemonge: because then it underlines the image
[14:11:49] <Connor_> Cya
[14:11:52] <eddiemonge> jugstah: its becase me and gnarf are like the same person sometimes
[14:11:54] <WebDragon> and the space between
[14:12:17] <jugstah> eddie- good advice tho cuz i googled on caching last night :-)
[14:12:19] <jugstah> bbl
[14:12:20] <jugstah> afk
[14:12:44] <Connor_> @eddiemonge I need your brain
[14:13:19] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: not really. change the span to an img like it should be, put that in the anchor tag and then look at the page
[14:13:24] <Connor_> http://jsfiddle.net/eg2xt/4/ is it possible for attribute to be a reference to a function
[14:13:45] <Connor_> Atm it just thinks attribute is a function name
[14:13:49] <WebDragon> eddiemonge: the image is a sprite
[14:14:02] <MoTiOnXml> Connor_: sure
[14:14:26] <WebDragon> http://caffegelato.client-proof.com/wp-content/themes/luxuos/images/social/CG_icon_set_35px_v2.png
[14:14:32] <Connor_> How would I go about that?
[14:14:43] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: ok then use the span. doesnt really matter
[14:14:54] <WebDragon> needs careful tweaking to position it properly for hover/active states
[14:15:09] <MoTiOnXml> Connor_: well, what i mean is that you can resolve functions by their string-based names
[14:15:17] <MoTiOnXml> Connor_: and invoke as well, obviously
[14:15:32] <eddiemonge> Connor_ http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/eg2xt/5/
[14:15:48] <Connor_> Oh :o
[14:15:54] <Connor_> Never seen that synatx in that context
[14:15:56] <Connor_> Interesting :P
[14:16:06] <Connor_> Thanks
[14:16:23] <eddiemonge> id of course do some filtering first otherwise that could be ba
[14:16:24] <eddiemonge> bad
[14:16:44] <Connor_> It could indeed xD
[14:20:40] <fakingfantastic> when you right objects for your application, do you access jQuery & 3rd party plugins directly, or do you pass them in when needed?
[14:20:45] <fakingfantastic> write*
[14:22:04] <Connor_> How do you mean, do you have an example?
[14:22:17] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/Tbqhj/
[14:23:44] <Connor_> Lol how can in any way can this be less that 1000:
[14:23:49] <Connor_> 1000 + (($wrapper.find(options.element).length - 1) * options.interval)
[14:23:50] <Connor_> Makes 0 sense
[14:24:40] <sean`> Connor_, if .length = 0
[14:24:57] <sean`> 1000 + ((0 - 1) * 500)
[14:25:01] <sean`> = -500
[14:25:15] <Connor_> Im getting 950 which is even stranger :/
[14:25:29] <sean`> well if options.interval is 50, that's not odd
[14:25:40] <Connor_> It is indeed
[14:25:44] <Connor_> I am not good with maths :)
[14:25:45] <sean`> omg
[14:30:15] <GeO2> how to attach a function on "click" ONLY if it hasn't been attached yet ?
[14:30:51] <Connor_> Been added to the document?
[14:31:05] <GeO2> to a button
[14:31:21] <Connor_> What do you mean by hasn't been attatched
[14:31:32] <GeO2> like myButton.click(function(){alert("foo");});
[14:32:01] <GeO2> if I execute this statement a second time, then a click will pop the alert two times
[14:32:32] <GeO2> so I want that the statement is ignored if the function is already attached to the click event
[14:32:32] <Connor_> Well if you wrote that code twice then yeah it would run both of them
[14:32:42] <GeO2> how can I prevent that ?
[14:33:15] <Connor_> So you literally have 2 lines of code that both bind that element to click?
[14:33:25] <Connor_> And you want the second to be ignore if the first has already been executed?
[14:33:56] <GeO2> well actually it's applied to a class of buttons, so a set of several buttons
[14:34:03] <Connor_> Oh right
[14:34:09] <GeO2> I have simplified the case, but same issue
[14:34:20] <Connor_> You could do it a few ways
[14:34:26] <GeO2> some of the buttons have already been handled, some haven't
[14:34:33] <Connor_> First is add a class onto the element the first time the click event is tirggered
[14:34:43] <Connor_> And then check if that class exists on that element
[14:34:48] <GeO2> for the moment I'm doing unbind("click") before, is it the most elegant solution?
[14:34:48] <Connor_> If it does, don't do anything
[14:35:16] <Connor_> Yeah I think you could do that
[14:35:22] <Snooops> hey mates
[14:35:27] <Connor_> Once you finish the first statement, unbind it
[14:35:31] <Connor_> Hi
[14:35:41] <GeO2> alright, thanks
[14:36:53] <Snooops> if im doing inside a input field named id="savebyenter" some text and hitting enter this alert box dont appear. can you help? http://nopaste.info/5e56131118.html
[14:38:51] <Connor_> 13 the code for enter?
[14:38:55] <Snooops> yes
[14:39:15] <Connor_> You put it in a $(document).ready(function(){}); wrapper?
[14:39:21] <Connor_> Or a window.load
[14:39:29] <Snooops> ah no
[14:39:31] <Snooops> ;)
[14:39:33] <Connor_> :P

[14:45:21] <pachet> ^
[14:45:27] <Connor_> About to say that pachet :P
[14:46:34] <rosieres> triying to load content into a div. it says my function is undefined . . .  i don´t see why -> http://jsfiddle.net/szuEJ/2/                           thanks for help in advance
[14:47:02] <Connor_> Cross site scripting
[14:47:07] <Connor_> First thing that came to my head :P
[14:47:17] <eddiemonge> rosieres: the ""+does nothing
[14:48:00] <Snooops> eddiemonge 1st keyup wont work too, 2nd i dont wanna test my scripts on that sides because more dificult to bugtrack
[14:48:21] <pachet> cough firebug cough
[14:48:38] <Snooops> jquery is included
[14:48:40] <Connor_> Also
[14:48:49] <Connor_> http://jsfiddle.net/szuEJ/4/
[14:48:57] <Connor_> Works but throws cross site scripting error
[14:49:12] <Connor_> So it would work if document was local
[14:49:28] <Connor_> Never use onclick attribute :P
[14:49:29] <rosieres> ahh . .  K ... thank you !
[14:49:51] <rosieres> it´s just for testing purpose . . .
[14:50:08] <Connor_> Test
[14:50:17] <pachet> Snooops: http://jsfiddle.net/hcg9v/
[14:50:21] <eddiemonge> Snooops: jsfiddle makes things more difficult to debug? really? how so? i find it makes it super easy
[14:51:49] <Connor_> value * 0.20 will calculate 20% of value right?
[14:51:52] <DetroitMC> I want Madonna to come down to my pad in the Lower East Side right now, rip my clothes off, scratch and bite me with her sharp teeth, and then fuck me.
[14:52:30] <initself> if you have a url to which you have added an onclick function, how do you prevent the browser from actually going to that url, since i'm just interested in the parameters of the url
[14:52:34] <initself> ?
[14:52:52] <Connor_> .click(functiion(event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[14:52:56] <Connor_> function*
[14:52:59] <eddiemonge> Snooops: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/hcg9V/1/  cc pachet you made key a global var
[14:53:07] <pachet> zz
[14:53:09] <initself> preventDefault, wow, never heard of that
[14:53:31] <Connor_> It's useful, remember it :P
[14:53:35] <initself> YES!
[14:53:42] <DetroitMC> event.preventDefault() doesn't work on Firefox 3.5!
[14:53:54] <initself> Does it work on IE6?
[14:53:58] <Connor_> Should do tbh
[14:54:02] <DetroitMC> Let's find out
[14:54:06] <Connor_> event as an argument should be supported in all browsers
[14:54:09] <Connor_> That's the point of having it
[14:54:14] <Connor_> Or at least most
[14:54:17] <pachet> yeah i call bullshit on that one
[14:54:27] <initself> what about just return false?
[14:54:35] <DetroitMC> Connor_: event.preventDefault() I found is ignored by FF 3.5
[14:54:47] <eddiemonge> it works in FF 3.5
[14:54:50] <DetroitMC> Connor_: I have to actually do return false
[14:55:00] <Connor_> Wat
[14:55:18] <Snooops> thx pachet
[14:55:54] <eddiemonge> Snooops: did you see my comment?
[14:56:07] <pachet> ^
[14:56:27] <Snooops> oh yes, thx
[14:57:43] <Connor_> Is value * 0.20 20% of value?
[14:57:48] <Connor_> Or am I doing it wrong :/
[14:58:02] <eddiemonge> it should be
[14:58:11] <eddiemonge> is value actually a number?
[14:58:17] <Connor_> Yeah
[14:58:43] <eddiemonge> ?eval 100 * 0.20
[14:58:44] <bot-t> eddiemonge: 20
[14:58:56] <eddiemonge> ?eval -100 * 0.20
[14:58:56] <bot-t> eddiemonge: -20
[14:59:06] <Connor_> Only issue I can think it is that there is multiple elements, but I am just going find(element).width()
[14:59:07] <pachet> ?eval
[14:59:08] <bot-t> pachet: Syntax: ? eval <javascript code>
[14:59:10] <Connor_> Could that affect it?
[14:59:10] <pachet> asdf
[14:59:26] <eddiemonge> ?eval "100px" * 0.20
[14:59:26] <bot-t> eddiemonge: NaN
[14:59:59] <Connor_> The width of every image is 98/99px, yet it comes out as 4
[15:00:12] <Connor_> http://development.connorburton.com/Half-Carousel/
[15:00:25] <Connor_> Easier to link there than link externally to the images on jsfiddle :)
[15:01:24] <Connor_> ?eval 99 * 0.20
[15:01:25] <bot-t> Connor_: 19.8
[15:01:37] <Connor_> Yeah sould round to 20
[15:01:40] <eddiemonge> yeah its returning multiple elements. specify only one or loop through and make an array
[15:01:48] <Connor_> Ah, array will be it
[15:02:23] <Connor_> Not sure it would be worth it to get the average width out of all the images
[15:02:46] <Connor_> Then get 20% of that
[15:03:30] <Connor_> Yeah returns array
[15:03:33] <Connor_> Hmm
[15:03:36] <Connor_> Thinking time
[15:04:13] <pachet> http://development.connorburton.com/Half-Carousel/
[15:04:18] <pachet> asdfasdf
[15:04:20] <pachet> irssi bindings
[15:04:24] <pachet> for the fucking loss
[15:04:45] <ravenzz> ?eval Math.floor(99 * 0.20)
[15:04:46] <bot-t> ravenzz: 19
[15:04:51] <ravenzz> Connor_ ^
[15:05:12] <Connor_> @edditmonge if I foreached the array of elements using forEach plain JS would 'this' still be a dom element I can jquerify :P
[15:05:29] <Connor_> Or would 'this' just be a jQuery object
[15:05:36] <ravenzz>  Math.round() sorry
[15:07:29] <Connor_> Actually im an idiot
[15:07:33] <Connor_> Forgot last question
[15:07:35] <electronplusplus> How do I get the value of align using jquery?
[15:07:46] <Connor_> .attr('align')
[15:07:47] <Connor_> ?
[15:07:57] <eddiemonge> electronplusplus: where are you using align? you shouldnt be
[15:08:10] <eddiemonge> but yes that would be the way
[15:08:21] <ravenzz> Connor_ what are you trying to achieve?
[15:08:21] <electronplusplus> <div align="center"> </div
[15:08:32] <electronplusplus> how do I get the value "center"
[15:08:34] <eddiemonge> electronplusplus: dont do that
[15:08:37] <Connor_> Well now I am trying to calculate the average width
[15:08:46] <electronplusplus> ?
[15:08:55] <eddiemonge> <div class="center"></div>   .center { text-align: center; }
[15:08:57] <prico> how do i make the contents of a div slide and be replaced by other?
[15:09:03] <ravenzz> ok give me a fiddle (jsfiddle.com) with a images collection
[15:09:16] <electronplusplus> eddiemonge: what if I don't what to use css?
[15:09:22] <eddiemonge> electronplusplus: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/graphics.html#h-15.1.2
[15:09:32] <eddiemonge> electronplusplus: thats just silly talk
[15:09:58] <eddiemonge> prico: load the conent underneath the visible content and then slide the content out. z-Indexes
[15:10:19] <electronplusplus> eddiemonge: I've build a framework just for fun, I've created a function similar to attr in jquery
[15:10:27] <Connor_> Sec got to add all images :P
[15:10:30] <electronplusplus> but I couldn't get the value using jquery attr
[15:10:44] <electronplusplus> $('#id').attr('align');
[15:10:51] <prico> eddiemonge: i don't know how to slide content, googling returned sliding widgets and stuff...
[15:10:54] <eddiemonge> electronplusplus: maybe because align doesnt exist
[15:10:58] <Connor_> http://jsfiddle.net/sNt27/
[15:11:04] <Connor_> @ravenzz ^
[15:11:09] <eddiemonge> slideout @ prico
[15:11:15] <eddiemonge> ? slideout @ prico
[15:11:17] <prico> it's a stupid eddiemonge thx
[15:11:18] <bot-t> prico, slideout | jQuery Plugins - jQuery Side Content is a simple way to add a pull-out menu to the side of your page, which will match the height of the view port and scroll to stay in view (i.e. it will always fill the whole heig... http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/slideout
[15:11:27] <eddiemonge> prico:  or use animate
[15:11:41] <Connor_> function calculateInitial() is where I am at
[15:11:52] <Connor_> And trying to fidn average of that, because what I returning atm is just returning an array
[15:11:53] <Connor_> Well
[15:11:57] <WebDragon> http://caffegelato.client-proof.com/contact/  eddiemonge -- look in firefox, you get the underline connecting it to the text
[15:11:59] <Connor_> An array * 0.20 :P
[15:12:35] <electronplusplus> eddiemonge: I don't understand the part of "doesn't exist", I'm using this tag and works
[15:12:43] <Connor_> @WebDragon, why not only apply text-decoration to the img only?
[15:12:52] <Connor_> And text-decoration:none to the text
[15:13:00] <WebDragon> text-decoration shouldn't be on the image, just the text
[15:13:03] <Connor_> Sorry other way round
[15:13:25] <Connor_> Or is the issue that the underline goes all the way across?
[15:13:32] <WebDragon> the image is contained within the link -- how do I selectively apply text-decoration to only part of an A ?
[15:13:43] <WebDragon> the issue is that the underline goes all the way across
[15:13:47] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: thats what happens when you use a span
[15:14:00] <Connor_> If the underline goes all the way across you have built it wrong
[15:14:03] <Connor_> It needs to float: left;
[15:14:04] <eddiemonge> electronplusplus: in what doctype?
[15:14:07] <Connor_> Next to the image
[15:14:07] <prico> what about page transictions with slide effect... hos is that done?
[15:14:10] <WebDragon> which is precisely what I'd been trying to avoid when I was doing it the other way
[15:14:21] <WebDragon> oddly, opera does not show the underline on the image, just the text
[15:14:35] <Connor_> Sec lemme open in FF
[15:14:35] <WebDragon> since it's empty
[15:15:40] <electronplusplus> eddiemonge: I've used the html5 doctype declaration
[15:16:30] <eddiemonge> electronplusplus: open it in chrome, does it show the attribute? align doesnt exist for divs in html5. stop using it
[15:16:43] <electronplusplus> I'm using chrome
[15:16:54] <electronplusplus> and I've tested in safari and firefox
[15:16:59] <Connor_> @WebDragon you have built it wrong
[15:17:06] <Connor_> You need to put a p/span around the actual text
[15:17:08] <Connor_> Like Twitter
[15:17:14] <eddiemonge> electronplusplus: look the short answer is : STOP USING ALIGN
[15:17:16] <Connor_> and then float the span and the p/span you just added left too
[15:17:31] <Connor_> And then it will stop that issue
[15:17:54] <Connor_> Or sorry
[15:17:58] <Connor_> Just make the new p/span and a
[15:18:07] <Connor_> Im an idiot ^^
[15:18:08] <Connor_> Bear with me
[15:18:21] <Connor_> Yeah wrap the actual text in an a then float that and the spam left
[15:18:23] <Connor_> span*
[15:18:43] <WebDragon> http://jsfiddle.net/Tbqhj/11/  it works fine here in opera and that page also looks fine in opera
[15:19:09] <WebDragon> I was following the fiddle that eddiemonge first had pasted, which while it worked here seems to do other things in Firefox
[15:19:31] <eddiemonge> WebDragon: ask about this in #css and see what they say
[15:19:33] <Connor_> I am imagine its because of other parent elements on the current site
[15:19:50] <electronplusplus> eddiemonge: I'm trying to make a cross browser framework, I've read that some developers are having issues with CSS. That's why I'm using align, where can I find documentation about it? to make a wiser choice .
[15:19:57] <jedimind_> WebDragon, dont! it's a trap!
[15:20:12] <ravenzz> Connor_ sorry I am back, http://jsfiddle.net/vPdB3/
[15:20:13] <WebDragon> x|
[15:20:17] <Connor_> Np :P
[15:20:20] <eddiemonge> electronplusplus: read what where? if you arent using CSS you are doing it wrong
[15:20:31] <Connor_> @WebDragon, floating them left will fix it :P Simple
[15:21:15] <enknot> hello
[15:21:28] <Connor_> And that works out the average ravenzz?
[15:21:52] <enknot> I'm curious how I can get the id of a DOM object by finding it by it's class name?
[15:22:11] <Connor_> $('element.myclass').attr('id');
[15:22:15] <eddiemonge> enknot: $('.class')[0].id
[15:22:24] <enknot> that is why you rock!
[15:22:27] <enknot> thank you
[15:22:46] <ravenzz> Connor_ that's basic math :S sum/numberOfElements
[15:23:09] <Connor_> Whats that funky [0] @eddiemonge?
[15:23:23] <Connor_> @ravenzz its late is my only excuse :P
[15:23:31] <eddiemonge> Connor_: it gets the dom element
[15:23:35] <ravenzz> np ;)
[15:23:45] <Connor_> Oh I see
[15:23:50] <ravenzz> Same here, I will go to sleep now
[15:24:09] <ccmonster> on a ajax load, i am trying to refresh a jquery ui menu with new data and I am having trouble. http://pastie.org/2528881
[15:24:10] <ravenzz> bye
[15:24:13] <Connor_> Cya
[15:25:05] <ccmonster> when it reloads, there are two menus, and the navigation.m reference isnt right anymore. Help straightening it all would be appreciated, thx
[15:25:42] <enknot> ok, I'm getting the id so that I can $ query it again, but don't I aready have a refrence to the object in questions?
[15:25:46] <enknot> er question...
[15:26:00] <enknot> sitll $('.active')[0].removeClass('active'); dosen't work
[15:26:25] <ccmonster> $('.active').eq(0).removeClass('active')
[15:26:28] <ccmonster> perhaps?
[15:26:29] <enknot> maybe I should just use another query... seems wasetful
[15:26:38] <ccmonster> or
[15:26:45] <enknot> researching .eq(0)
[15:26:47] <ccmonster> $('.active:first-child').removeClass('active')
[15:26:48] <eddiemonge> enknot: if you are querying it to use again then do $ele = $('.element')
[15:26:52] <enknot> what is that thang
[15:26:57] <eddiemonge> then you can use $ele where ever you want
[15:27:19] <enknot> nice ccmonster
[15:27:23] <enknot> and thank you eddiemonge
[15:27:24] <ccmonster> ?
[15:27:55] <ccmonster> if you want to remove the other 'active' you could also slive
[15:27:56] <ccmonster> slice*
[15:28:13] <ccmonster> $('.active').slice(1).remove(), which would remove everything BUT the first el
[15:28:17] <electronplusplus> thanks eddiemonge
[15:28:38] <enknot> ccmonster that last piece of code worked, but I'll put that in my cap for understanding this framework a little better
[15:28:48] <ccmonster> which part worked?
[15:29:05] <enknot> $('.active:first-child').removeClass('active');
[15:29:08] <enknot> one query
[15:29:11] <enknot> bam done
[15:29:28] <ccmonster> ah, good to hear :)
[15:29:35] <bitwise_> how do i reference the elements in an array i pass in via a $.tmpl call?
[15:29:48] <bitwise_> (flat 2d array)
[15:29:54] <ccmonster> ?demo @bitwise
[15:29:54] <bot-t> bitwise, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:30:11] <ccmonster> never done anything with $.tmpl
[15:30:52] <bitwise_> ok, working on that
[15:31:14] <enknot> thanks everybunny
[15:31:27] <enknot> I"ll be here again... hopefully only helping next time
[15:31:29] <enknot> :D
[15:31:53] <ccmonster> help and be helped. Either works :)
[15:32:36] <Connor_> $(this).[attribute]()
[15:32:39] <Connor_> Doesn't work :/
[15:32:51] <Connor_> Attribute being an argument that references a function
[15:32:55] <ccmonster> $(this).attr('attr')
[15:33:16] <ccmonster> that gets. settings is $(this).attr('name','thename')
[15:33:24] <Connor_> What it is supposed to do is actually call the function what attribute is
[15:33:26] <Connor_> So for example
[15:33:34] <Connor_> If attribute was height
[15:33:39] <Connor_> Then it would be $(this).height();
[15:33:43] <Connor_> I had it working before
[15:33:54] <Connor_> But I put it a each loop and dosen't work anymore :/
[15:33:54] <ccmonster> you can do $(this).css('height')
[15:34:06] <ccmonster> pastie your code somewhere (not in the room)
[15:34:10] <Connor_> http://development.connorburton.com/Half-Carousel/
[15:34:18] <Connor_> View source/inspect element
[15:34:40] <Connor_> Attribute is an argument
[15:34:47] <ccmonster> ok
[15:35:02] <Connor_> And css() won't work as there is no css regarding the elements I will be getting
[15:35:34] <Connor_> I had it working before I put it in the .each, it may be a scoping issue, let me see
[15:35:35] <ccmonster> so you want to set the height/width for each one?
[15:35:45] <ccmonster> I am sure it's scoping, but I dont see any actual code?
[15:36:18] <ccmonster> ah, halfcarousel is actually yours. I thought it was a plugin so was looking past it
[15:36:36] <Connor_> Fiddled it up
[15:36:36] <Connor_> http://jsfiddle.net/sNt27/1/
[15:36:38] <Connor_> There ya go
[15:37:04] <ccmonster> like the pics, btw :)
[15:37:09] <Connor_> :P
[15:37:23] <Connor_> Even when its not actually inside the .each it still throws a synatx error
[15:37:23] <ccmonster> which attr you want?
[15:37:31] <Connor_> The attr is dependent on what attribute is
[15:37:32] <ccmonster> it does not like the []
[15:37:42] <Connor_> So if attribute contains 'height' it will call height()
[15:37:48] <Connor_> If its width it will call width()
[15:37:58] <Connor_> Let me see if I can dig ou the code that worked
[15:38:07] <Connor_> $wrapper.find(options.element)[attribute]()
[15:38:10] <Connor_> That worked before &
[15:38:11] <Connor_> ^
[15:38:21] <Connor_> Oh, no dot!
[15:38:23] <Connor_> Lol
[15:38:27] <ccmonster> drr
[15:38:27] <ccmonster> yea
[15:38:30] <ccmonster> or             console.log($wrapper.find(options.element).attr(attribute);
[15:38:36] <ccmonster> just change the way you acces it
[15:38:53] <Connor_> Does attr get hidden attributes?
[15:38:58] <Connor_> Like if I haven't set height=""
[15:39:07] <ccmonster> that's css, not attr
[15:39:18] <Connor_> I mean
[15:39:28] <Connor_> I need the bags don't have any width="" attributes or any css set
[15:39:34] <Connor_> That's why I was doing height() and width()
[15:39:37] <ccmonster> ok
[15:39:45] <Connor_> But does attr get the width or height if it dosen't have any css or html attributes set?
[15:40:21] <ccmonster> that might depend on browser
[15:40:27] <ccmonster> you can just look for length || undefined
[15:40:32] <ccmonster> and use that as a check
[15:40:42] <webguynow> I want to clear out my validation error messages ( for all my input fields ).    best way ?  selector   var input_flds = $(':input')     ??    then code the change() method ??
[15:40:45] <ccmonster> do an alert on fiddle to dbl check
[15:41:21] <ccmonster> it looks like they are set as undefined
[15:41:37] <Connor_> Hm okay
[15:41:52] <Connor_> @webguynow if you know the element that the error messages are in you can do:
[15:41:56] <Connor_> $(element).val('');
[15:42:03] <Connor_> Which will set the value to an empty string
[15:42:04] <Connor_> Should work
[15:42:44] <ccmonster> ^ yup
[15:42:48] <webguynow> was thinking of using  removeClass()   addClass   and  html
[15:43:04] <enknot> heeeello again
[15:43:15] <Connor_> Well if you just want to absolutley get rid of the error messages then val() is better
[15:43:24] <Connor_> If you don't then you could do $(element).hide()
[15:43:30] <enknot> ok...really easy one (for you)  trying to make a subselection of something that I have the $(this) of
[15:43:35] <Connor_> Or $(element).css('visiblity': 'hidden');
[15:43:41] <enknot> like $(this).$('img')
[15:43:50] <ccmonster> $(this).children('img')
[15:43:55] <enknot> but that is not the syntax
[15:43:59] <enknot> sic
[15:44:02] <enknot> thanks ccmonster
[15:44:16] <ccmonster> its good practice to make a ref to $(this) and use it instead
[15:44:36] <ccmonster> such as $this = $(this); $this.children('img') // my images;
[15:45:46] <Connor_> ?eval 224 / 7
[15:45:47] <bot-t> Connor_: 32
[15:46:09] <Connor_> ?eval (224 / 7) * 0.20
[15:46:10] <bot-t> Connor_: 6.4
[15:46:19] <Connor_> Lies!
[15:46:50] <Connor_> ?eval 166 * .20
[15:46:51] <bot-t> Connor_: 33.2
[15:46:57] <Connor_> Sigh
[15:47:14] <webguynow> ah  I have a thorny issue with the removal of error messages - they are actually in <span> tags with the id set to   {fld}_val.   I'll need to derive that id from the input I'm using when I code  change()
[15:47:48] <Connor_> If you select an element by id you will only get one back
[15:47:55] <Connor_> So that won't work to delete them
[15:48:02] <ccmonster> yes, because id's are unique, one per page
[15:48:11] <Connor_> You need to do it by class or some clever tree traversal
[15:48:14] <Connor_> Which is always fun
[15:48:33] <ccmonster> any chance you can throw a class on those webguynow ?
[15:48:50] <Connor_> If you are using jquery.validate.js it should already have class="error"
[15:49:18] <webguynow> no, I'm not using validate  ( but maybe I should be ) - decided to roll-my-own
[15:49:35] <Connor_> Its probably better but if you already have made your own then roll with that
[15:49:45] <webguynow> the span is right after the input -  sibling, so to speak
[15:50:00] <Connor_> You need to put classes on them, or if there is an element near the error with a class you could tree traversal that
[15:50:11] <ccmonster> got a demo page webguynow ?
[15:51:07] <Connor_> I don't understand :( my brain is not ready for maths today
[15:51:56] <ccmonster> whats wrong Connor_
[15:52:10] <Connor_> Function is not returning the right value, well it is
[15:52:13] <Connor_> But not the expected value
[15:52:23] <webguynow> element near the error -  tree traversal ??   give me an idea what you are suggesting
[15:53:10] <ccmonster> $('input').next('span').eq(0) perhaps
[15:53:19] <ccmonster> not sure of what your structure is at all, so shot in the dark
[15:53:23] <Connor_> Don't even next eq don't think
[15:53:30] <Connor_> If you want to get rid of them all
[15:53:37] <ccmonster> you want to get rid of all ?
[15:53:42] <ccmonster> whats the goal? find the span, then what?
[15:53:50] <ccmonster> span(s)...?
[15:53:57] <Connor_> Change val to an empty string
[15:53:59] <Connor_> Or hide
[15:54:03] <Connor_> Depends what webguynow wants
[15:54:11] <ccmonster> the val of spans?
[15:54:13] <ccmonster> or the input?
[15:54:15] <Connor_> Spans
[15:54:20] <Connor_> They have the errors in
[15:54:20] <ccmonster> spans have vals?
[15:54:28] <ccmonster> spans should have text()
[15:54:34] <webguynow> yea  I'll empty it,  reset the html  and change the class
[15:54:50] <ccmonster> webguy, you got a sample of your html structure?
[15:55:08] <Connor_> That is true, it should be text() sorry
[15:56:01] <webguynow> I could post it in a pastebin  - I might wait tho  - in 20 minutes it may be a work of art   :-)
[15:56:24] <webguynow> where do my days go ??   haha
[15:57:04] <ccmonster> well I can help you easier if i had some understanding of your structure
[15:57:17] <webguynow> right
[15:57:18] <ccmonster> its probably (usually is) somethign simple, just easily overlooked
[15:57:40] <Connor_> Im gonna work on this plugin tomorrow, will probably all make sense then :P
[15:57:49] <webguynow> I notice change() is not firing when I'd expect it to  ( either every keystroke  or at least  onblur()  )
[15:57:54] <ccmonster> time away can do wonders Connor_  :)
[15:58:08] <ccmonster> you want keyup/down/press
[15:58:08] <Connor_> Indeed, though I will be working on it straight after 7 hours of programming >.<
[15:58:09] <ccmonster> for inputs
[15:58:17] <ccmonster> text inputs*
[15:58:49] <Connor_> @webguynow change() = enter text and then click out of the element, sort of, sometimes it works
[15:59:58] <webguynow> per Doc's
[16:00:14] <webguynow> select, checkbox, radio  .....,  but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus.
[16:00:33] <Connor_> Indeed
[16:01:00] <ccmonster> the textinput is tricky, esp browser to browser
[16:01:08] <Connor_> Really though, you shouldn't have to check anything on every key stroke
[16:01:18] <Connor_> Its not optimal and dosen't really add anything over change()
[16:01:20] <ccmonster> doing it 'right' usually involves a combination of keypress and event.which exceptions.
[16:01:40] <Connor_> Bassicaly, its a big ball ache
[16:01:44] <webguynow> I'm not even getting the event, when I change fields  ( at least not very regularly )
[16:01:45] <ccmonster> well, ideally your needs dont require keystroke following
[16:02:16] <Connor_> Unless you are doing some funky online keylogger xD
[16:02:16] <ccmonster> .change(function(e){console.log('changing?',e})
[16:02:30] <ccmonster> Well i had to right an app that involves delayed keypress searching
[16:02:32] <ccmonster> write*
[16:02:44] <ccmonster> like how google searches after keystrokes
[16:03:10] <Connor_> Yeah, I mean there are uses for it. But generally change() is a better option, especially for validation
[16:03:16] <Connor_> I mean why do you need to validate mid type?
[16:03:27] <ccmonster> oh, ...def dont want to validate mid type
[16:03:31] <ccmonster> good lord. eff that
[16:05:59] <webguynow> if I use a  $(':input')  selector  - can I evaluate the array/list of what that returns  ?
[16:06:24] <ccmonster> sure.
[16:06:27] <ccmonster> log it out
[16:07:08] <ccmonster> then loop through and filter by attr('type')
[16:07:09] <ccmonster> if you want
[16:07:15] <Connor_> :input, is that a selector?
[16:07:20] <Connor_> Shouldn't it be just input
[16:07:42] <electronplusplus> I've to make some documentation for my framework, is there any program that generates documentation in html?
[16:07:43] <ccmonster> you can just do a $(':input')
[16:07:57] <Connor_> Hm, weird
[16:08:06] <ccmonster> im sure there are doc generators, lots of IDES do it on the fly as you do @params and such
[16:08:09] <Connor_> And @electronplusplus what language is it written in?
[16:08:14] <electronplusplus> javascript
[16:08:19] <Connor_> Hm
[16:08:22] <Connor_> Don't know
[16:08:24] <ccmonster> not sure , i use eclipse/aptana so I do all mines on the fly
[16:08:25] <electronplusplus> I want it to have a friendly documentation
[16:08:27] <Connor_> Netbeans has quite alot
[16:08:37] <electronplusplus> but I don't want to code for it :)
[16:08:39] <Connor_> There have a really good technical PHP documentation generator
[16:09:07] <bot-t> jsdoc-toolkit - A documentation generator for JavaScript. - Google ... - http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/
[16:09:17] <bot-t> docco.coffee - http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/
[16:09:40] <Connor_> Anyway its midnight so I am off to bed. Hopefully get some actual functionallity done for my plugin tomorrow :P
[16:10:16] <electronplusplus> docco.coffee seams cool 
[16:10:20] <Birliban> i want to display lot of different json data in grids, like firebug console.table, is there a dynamic and short way (maybe plugin) to solve this with jquery?
[16:11:07] <electronplusplus> Birliban: http://www.trirand.com/blog/
[16:11:54] <ccmonster> data.tablse?
[16:12:00] <Birliban> electronplusplus, thats what i was on the last hours, but its too huge and overloaded...
[16:12:13] <ccmonster> dataTables for jquery probably
[16:12:37] <electronplusplus> http://datatables.net/
[16:12:51] <webguynow>  I'm on FF and using Firebug but wondering how X-browser compatible all these properties are - some minor success  - I see attributes has a name, I can use id, and there is  nextElementSibling  -  IE / Chrome support these elements too ?
[16:12:56] <ccmonster> that looks like it
[16:13:04] <Birliban> i'll have a look, thx!
[16:13:11] <ccmonster> np
[16:13:19] <fructose> Is it possible to locate the "previous" form from an onClick event? e.g. I'd like to be able to put a link below any form and have it edit that (and only that) form
[16:13:19] <ccmonster> what are you asking webguynow ?
[16:14:28] <ccmonster> $('a.class').click(function(e){$(this).parent('form').after($('<p></p').text('...im appending stuff'))})
[16:14:30] <ccmonster> or something
[16:15:21] <ccmonster> you might have to do a parent('form').eq(0) if you have lots of forms or something. i cannot remember if it only gets the nearest, or all of them
[16:15:48] <fructose> ccmonster: parent('form') would only work if the link were in <form></form>, right?
[16:15:53] <ccmonster> yes.
[16:15:59] <ccmonster> if its a child of that form, correct
[16:16:10] <ccmonster> you want previous form?
[16:16:14] <fructose> ccmonster: Yes, previous
[16:16:18] <TheEmpath> anyone familiar with jqgrid?  i need to have a custom search field make an ajax call, then i need to populate the jqgrid with the results
[16:16:34] <TheEmpath> i see a reloadGrid() function and a populate() functino, but no parameters
[16:16:36] <ccmonster> try datatables.net TheEmpath
[16:17:17] <ccmonster> Whats the structure of this link in relation to the form?
[16:17:28] <ccmonster> is it a sibling, or is it also nested in parent elements?
[16:17:45] <TheEmpath> its some input that, when i click on a button, i make an ajax call and get back json
[16:17:51] <TheEmpath> then i need to map the json to the grid
[16:18:07] <TheEmpath> but jqgrid doesn't seem to support that
[16:18:12] <fructose> ccmonster: It could be either
[16:18:19] <ccmonster> ok, if its nested
[16:18:34] <ccmonster> $('a.mylink').prev('form')
[16:18:54] <ccmonster> ?traversing
[16:18:54] <bot-t> Docs: Traversing - http://api.jquery.com/category/Traversing/
[16:19:06] <ccmonster> do you have a sample/demo fructose
[16:19:58] <ccmonster> alright, im out guys. Good luck
[16:20:02] <fructose> ccmonster: No, but I didn't know about prev. That's a good suggestion, thanks
[16:20:59] <Jay1> Can I apply multiple css styles in one .css() call?  or do I have to do .css('width',a).css('height',b);?
[16:30:11] <DesignerGuy> hello all
[16:30:21] <Jay1> hi
[16:31:35] <fructose> Am I the only one that finds it weird that this is true... element = []; if (element == false && !element == false) alert('true');
[16:32:23] <ajpiano> welcome to javascript, meet our friend the == operator that coerces types
[16:32:31] <ajpiano> use ===
[16:33:14] <DesignerGuy> element = []; if (element == false && !element === false) alert('true');
[16:34:05] <ajpiano> ?eval ![]
[16:34:05] <bot-t> ajpiano: false
[16:39:28] <mehwork> what can the .find() method do that jquery selectors can't do?
[16:40:01] <ajpiano> nothing
[16:40:32] <HammHetField> good evening :)
[16:40:52] <mehwork> ajpiano: so why does it even exist
[16:40:57] <ajpiano> LOL
[16:41:29] <ajpiano> because searching the descendants of an already-existing collection is very very common thing to do?
[16:42:14] <HammHetField> I'm doing a $.post and on success, I'd like to remove a class, with a delay ($("#element").delay(1000).removeClass("paid");) but for some reason, the rest of the code in and after the success event only runs when the delay is over and the class removed. Any idea how I could avoid this behavior ?
[16:42:17] <mehwork> i'm new to jqueyr, not sure i follow
[16:42:37] <ajpiano> mehwork: because sometimes you want all the foos
[16:42:45] <ajpiano> $(".foo")
[16:42:55] <ajpiano> and other times you want to get all the foos and find all the spans inside of that
[16:42:59] <ajpiano> $(".foo").find("span")
[16:43:07] <ajpiano> and sometimes you have an already existing collection
[16:43:21] <ajpiano> var foo = $(".foo");  and then you want to search in it... foo.find("span.bar");
[16:43:22] <ajpiano> etc
[16:43:23] <fructose> I'm trying to get the 2nd form on a page... jQuery.find('form') gives me a list of several, but jQuery.find('form').first().next() gives me null. Where am I screwing up?
[16:43:38] <ajpiano> fructose: "next" isn't "magically find the next one anywhere"
[16:43:50] <mehwork> $(".foo span") is the same as $(".foo").find("span") isn't it
[16:43:55] <ajpiano> .next() is "get the next element sibling of the selected element(s)"
[16:43:55] <HammHetField> fructose: tried using eq() instead ? not sure but that could help
[16:44:03] <mehwork> ok the last example makes sense
[16:44:17] <ajpiano> mehwork: yes.  but you aren't always going to be in a place where just querying the entire document is what you want to do
[16:44:27] <mehwork> i see, thanks
[16:44:42] <HammHetField> any idea about my issue with delay() and the code being synchronous ?
[16:45:34] <ajpiano> HammHetField: see ?delay2
[16:45:35] <bot-t> HammHetField, .delay() is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects and such, and is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases. (from api.jquery.com/delay/ )
[16:45:42] <fructose> HammHetField: jQuery.find('form:eq(1)') works, but adding .children() fails
[16:46:05] <ajpiano> fructose: if you want to be able to get from form to form in the document regardless of their position
[16:46:05] <HammHetField> ajpiano: setTimeout does the same, I tried that one too
[16:46:28] <HammHetField> ajpiano: "same" as in the rest of the code waits for it to timeout to execute
[16:46:53] <ajpiano> you have to do something like var forms = $("form");   forms.eq( someFormElement.index() + 1 );
[16:47:00] <ajpiano> HammHetField: it's hard to tell from that code sample
[16:47:10] <ajpiano> you have that logic inside of the success callback?
[16:47:31] <HammHetField> ajpiano: well I can't really give samples, the code is spread in several files, functions and classes it's a huge mess
[16:47:36] <ajpiano> lol
[16:47:38] <ajpiano> ok
[16:47:55] * HammHetField is working on someone else's code and cries really often because of that :p
[16:48:08] <ajpiano> hm
[16:48:49] <HammHetField> basically, on success I'd like to close the lightbox, add a class to an element, and tell the script to remove this class 2 seconds later
[16:49:03] <HammHetField> the problem is : all that code waits for the delay to be finished and executes all at once
[16:49:34] <HammHetField> so when the lightbox closes, the class is added and removed right away instead of staying there for 2 seconds
[16:49:53] <ajpiano> ostensibly you need to do success: function() { closeLightbox(); setTimeout(function() { $("#something").removeClass("somethingElse");  },2000);   }
[16:50:16] <HammHetField> I'll try that again in case I did it wrong the first time
[16:50:25] <ajpiano> success: function() {var elem = $("#something").addClass("somethingElse"); closeLightbox(); setTimeout(function() { elem.removeClass("somethingElse");  },2000);   }
[16:51:49] <take_it_t> hey guys, how do i go about changing the selection of a select box?
[16:52:36] <HammHetField> ajpiano: well for some reason it seems to work now... I guess I did something wrong the first time
[16:52:39] <HammHetField> ajpiano: thanks :D
[16:53:55] <ajpiano> take_it_t: set the $("#select").val("theValueOfAnOptionInTheSelect");
[16:54:11] <Jarred> Hey so I'm having some strange problems with a jQuery UI Dialog
[16:54:13] <Jarred> http://pastie.org/private/j7eaz9spfqxmylfiauxpg is the jQuery
[16:54:18] <Jarred> The dialog pops up
[16:54:20] <Jarred> but the buttons don't
[16:54:30] <ajpiano> np HammHetField um
[16:54:46] <ajpiano> np HammHetField had cooked up to demo to show i wasn't crazy http://jsfiddle.net/USTm7/ :)
[16:54:55] <ajpiano> Jarred: you're not passing the options to the dialog
[16:55:09] <ajpiano> you're creating the dialog... and then after ward, declaring an object literal inside some parentehses
[16:55:27] <ajpiano> http://pastie.org/private/2kfoq0u7yrr6ctjqldwu0q
[16:55:39] <take_it_t> ajpiano: perfect thank you
[16:56:06] <Jarred> Oh didn't notice that
[16:56:07] <Jarred> thanks
[16:56:10] <Jarred> That fixed it
[16:56:23] <HammHetField> ajpiano: I think the first time I tried it I had an issue with scope and code things like that... I don't know but it works and you'r enot crazy so everything is good !
[16:58:20] <mape> Is there a good jQuery plugin for dealing with rotateX and rotateY animations?
[16:58:30] <snover> ajpiano: FUCK YEAH
[16:59:11] <ajpiano> mape: seen https://github.com/louisremi/jquery.transition.js/ ?
[17:00:39] <mape> ajpiano: doesn't seem to do rotateX/Y?
[17:01:29] <mape> or perhaps I dont get it
[17:02:55] <ajpiano> i think i meant to send you this https://github.com/louisremi/jquery.transform.js
[17:03:22] <mape> yeah, still only rotate, no rotateX/Y :/
[17:04:01] <ajpiano> not sure then :/
[17:04:30] <mape> and seems impossible to find a good easy guide to build a custom animate thingymadoo
[17:06:32] <ajpiano> mape, you should pick gnarf's brain a bit when you get a chance and he's arround

[17:27:39] <initself> <jesus
[17:28:05] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/fWXve/ << i want clicking "Follow Up" to give me my alert and not attempt to go to the url.
[17:29:49] <kborchers> initself: you have a syntax error ... you didn't add your ending ); for your ready
[17:31:14] <initself> kborchers++
[17:32:44] <electronplusplus> initself: it would be easy to set an id for each row and onclick="ajax_function(this.id)"
[17:33:26] <initself> whoa, you read my inner thoughts!
[17:33:42] <initself> would i still use click(function(event) { then?
[17:33:51] <Dollz> can I trigger a click programatically on a hidden element ( display :none  ) ?
[17:34:10] <electronplusplus> not really initself
[17:34:22] <ajpiano> good lord
[17:34:26] <electronplusplus> ready the doc about the jquery $.ajax
[17:34:29] <ajpiano> pleaes don't recommend that people switch to inline handlers please
[17:34:32] <electronplusplus> it's really cool and easy
[17:34:47] <initself> ya, i was sorta going for the unobtrusive thing
[17:34:48] <kborchers> ajpiano: i was just thinking that exact thought ... "good lord"
[17:34:54] <initself> ya ....
[17:35:00] <initself> the thought i was thinking was....
[17:35:11] <initself> i need to use ids for each row
[17:35:21] <initself> not so much the inline part
[17:36:52] <electronplusplus> initself: don't need id for each row? How?
[17:37:08] <initself> DO need.
[17:37:09] <electronplusplus> ajpiano: kborchers he's using inline handlers :\
[17:37:18] <ajpiano> you have access to the clicked element a thousand ways if you just use bind
[17:37:19] <electronplusplus> initself: my mistake :)
[17:37:27] <ajpiano> instead of this inline thing
[17:37:31] <electronplusplus> exactly
[17:37:39] <electronplusplus> look at the source in jsfindler
[17:37:44] <electronplusplus> jsfindle*
[17:38:34] <electronplusplus> initself: bind the handler to class that you only use in this kind of rows
[17:38:46] <ajpiano> i saw yeah, he's not invoking the function... should be onclick="miketest()") lol
[17:39:32] <initself> o see
[17:39:45] <initself> I write jQuery like once every 4 months.
[17:39:59] <initself> I start from scratch almost every time.  It's awful.
[17:40:09] <ajpiano> i get a haircut every four months, i don't forget where the place is
[17:40:10] <ajpiano> :)
[17:40:12] <initself> I see what you guys are saying.  There's really no need at all for onclick in my HTML.
[17:40:31] <electronplusplus> initself: I've created a great web apps using jquery. developing and learning, 2 weeks :)
[17:40:39] <initself> Me too.
[17:40:43] <initself> I still can't freaking remember.
[17:41:08] <electronplusplus> think in something interesting to code and code it
[17:41:32] <electronplusplus> when I was a kid i coded some worms and trojan horses just for fun
[17:41:34] <initself> Is node.js and it's ilk about, like, pushing updates to browsers connected to it?
[17:42:07] <ajpiano> initself: it makes apps like that really fun to write, but node.js is about evented, server-side javascript
[17:42:37] <initself> right now, i'm thinking i need some code that polls my server for updates from the client to the server.
[17:42:47] <electronplusplus> initself: ya, using long polling and/or websockets
[17:42:47] <queso> What's the best way to fadein an element that is being added?
[17:43:03] <initself> So let's say if two people had the same browser open, and one person clicked "update", both browsers would sync (eventually).
[17:43:04] <ajpiano> queso: $("<div>").hide().appendTo(document.body).show();
[17:43:12] <electronplusplus> initself: yes
[17:43:14] <initself> But does node.js make that kind of thing real time?
[17:43:17] <queso> ajpiano: sweet, thank you
[17:43:24] <electronplusplus> in a long poll you have an ajax request
[17:43:37] <electronplusplus> but the request takes some time to "die"
[17:43:42] <initself> i see
[17:43:47] <electronplusplus> during this time
[17:44:00] <initself> so i bet i can have a jquery triggered long pole to any server side thing?
[17:44:00] <electronplusplus> if an update is available
[17:44:12] <electronplusplus> node.js send to all connect clients
[17:44:20] <electronplusplus> and then the client must connect again
[17:44:27] <initself> interesting
[17:44:32] <electronplusplus> the better solution is websockets
[17:44:43] <initself> websockets + jQuery ajax?
[17:44:46] <Jay1> Can anyone tell me why my slider looks good in FF but crappy in Chrome when dragging rapidly? http://jsdo.it/TheSisb/pFWU
[17:45:17] <ajpiano> using socket.io / now.js is way better
[17:45:20] <initself> electronplusplus: is wrong for me to think in terms of just an ajax refresh?
[17:45:21] <ajpiano> yea
[17:45:52] <electronplusplus> initself: it's an ajax request, except for websockets
[17:46:04] <initself> so it *will* matter what i have on the backend?
[17:46:14] <initself> i just need some language that speaks websockets?
[17:46:42] <electronplusplus> yes
[17:46:48] <electronplusplus> node.js makes it really easy to code
[17:46:58] <initself> all i am really versed in is Perl CGI requests, making the db connect and passing back the JSON.
[17:47:01] <electronplusplus> and the performance is good for medium apps
[17:47:08] <initself> I need to figure out how to make that model speak websockets?
[17:47:13] <initself> or can i make do with what I know?
[17:47:40] <electronplusplus> do you know what's a websocket?
[17:47:44] <initself> no
[17:47:47] <ajpiano> initself: are you using rails by any chance
[17:47:51] <electronplusplus> and a socket?
[17:47:53] <initself> a persistant client/server connection?
[17:47:57] <initself> ajpiano: perl, dogg!
[17:48:04] <ajpiano> lol
[17:48:05] <ajpiano> ok
[17:48:09] <ajpiano> nm
[17:48:12] <initself> STRAIGHT CGI GANGSTA
[17:48:42] <electronplusplus> initself: yes, in a websockets the client send some headers
[17:48:47] <electronplusplus> like in a ajax request
[17:49:01] <electronplusplus> then you only send and receive your data
[17:49:12] <sphinxxxx> what would be a use for something like socket.io ?
[17:49:17] <electronplusplus> it's a great way to save bandwidth
[17:49:20] <sphinxxxx> i'm just curious b/c its the first time i heard of it
[17:49:22] <initself> i see, somehwat
[17:49:27] <ajpiano> sphinxxxx: any real time chat application or game
[17:49:39] <Jay1> I wish nginx had backend http/1.1
[17:49:46] <danieliser> have a div that im using like an iframe essentially, all links inside it load new content to it. Works great.. How can i add an effective back button to that container? there will be multiple instances of these vframe widgets
[17:49:48] <ajpiano> where i want to push a message to the client saying "such and such happened"
[17:49:51] <electronplusplus> initself: you need to learn a lot
[17:49:51] <danieliser> any ideas?
[17:50:20] <initself> Sya, i hate learning
[17:50:32] <electronplusplus> outsource xD
[17:50:40] <initself> ya, i hate paying people
[17:50:44] <initself> (actually, i dont)
[17:50:46] <electronplusplus> pay a penny to some indian dev
[17:51:01] <Jay1> and get a shitty job
[17:51:12] <electronplusplus> Jay1: true :(
[17:51:27] <electronplusplus> one day my boss ordered a simple php site
[17:51:31] <electronplusplus> really simple
[17:51:55] <Jay1> danieliser: window.history.back ?
[17:52:01] <electronplusplus> the guy probably had some kind of bizarre mvc model
[17:52:23] <electronplusplus> for output a simple table, 12 includes :X
[17:52:23] <wreel> mvc is bizarre?
[17:52:34] <electronplusplus> wreel: mvc is cool
[17:52:37] <electronplusplus> but the code....
[17:52:43] <wreel> gotcha
[17:52:44] <Jay1> Still struggling with my own problem, any help appreciated: Can anyone tell me why my slider looks good in FF but crappy in Chrome when dragging rapidly? http://jsdo.it/TheSisb/pFWU
[17:52:58] <electronplusplus> imagine a php file with 12 includes
[17:53:13] <electronplusplus> probably script generated but a really bad script
[17:54:55] <initself> Jay1: seems broken in FF 3
[17:55:01] <initself> won't slide at all
[17:56:02] <Jay1> people still use ff3? x.x
[17:56:06] <Jay1> odd
[17:56:17] <Jay1> any errors in console or something?
[17:57:00] <electronplusplus> Jay1: people still use IE
[17:57:26] <ajpiano> electronplusplus: there aren't really a lot of people who use less than at the very minimum ff 3.6
[17:57:55] <electronplusplus> where can I find such stats? ajpiano
[17:58:11] <Jay1> i dont care about ie users :) im lucky
[18:01:42] <ajpiano> ....

[18:02:44] <acalbaza> what is the proper way to set data in a plugin?  i cant, for the life of me, set a value or fetch a value.... http://pastebin.com/18WThj2r
[18:03:01] <initself> Other is out of control!
[18:05:20] <ajpiano> acalbaza: you have to investigate and see what 'this' is inside of those various functions
[18:05:27] <ajpiano> and make sure all is as you expect
[18:06:31] <acalbaza> as i understand it, this should be the element associated with the call... im a little fuzzy on this.
[18:06:45] <ajpiano> you can debug

[18:09:20] <trakinas> hello all. Im trying to implement a anchor tag based menu. the JS first try to rely on HTML5 resources, and then, falls back to AJAX/anchortag. It works okay on FF, Chrome, Opera and IE 8/9. IE 7 refuses to load the content when clicking, though it builds the url right. I'm calling the content via .load(url). I tried a lot of fixes foiund over the internet, but that took me nowhere. please,...
[18:09:21] <trakinas> ...I need your help.
[18:11:05] <bot-t> trakinas, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[18:26:59] <queso> How do you remove an event?  e.g., $('body').click(...);
[18:27:21] <seancurtis> $('body').unbind('click')
[18:27:26] <seancurtis> that'll unbind all click events
[18:27:39] <seancurtis> if you've bound a particular function you can unbind that individually
[18:27:50] <queso> seancurtis: how do you do that?
[18:28:09] <seancurtis> queso: http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[18:28:29] <queso> seancurtis: nice,thank you
[18:29:06] <seancurtis> basically if you do $('body').click(function(){ ... }); then that's an anonymous function and you can't unbind that one specifically - if however you do $('body').click(someFunction); then you can unbind that one individually :)
[18:29:10] <gnarf> mape: you still around?
[18:29:33] <gnarf> I'm just dropping in briefly, but if you can find a good cssHook for rotateX and rotateY - it should work just fine with animate
[18:29:48] <mape> gnarf: kk
[18:30:24] <queso> seancurtis: got it :)
[18:31:10] <gnarf> mape: this one seems decent: http://transformjs.strobeapp.com/
[18:31:44] <mape> gnarf: awsome, thanks
[18:32:54] <ajpiano> gah that one vaguely crossed my mind, forgot to link it
[18:33:48] <gnarf> im out again - seee ?glwt
[18:33:57] <gnarf> boo
[18:33:58] <gnarf> can't type
[18:34:01] * gnarf poofs
[18:37:21] <queso> Is there a way to add css such that the style applies to future added elements, as if it were in a .css file that was loaded?
[18:37:36] <ajpiano> ?g jquery.rule
[18:37:37] <bot-t> ajpiano, Ariel Flesler: jQuery.Rule - http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/11/jqueryrule.html
[18:37:45] <ajpiano> you can also use... css for that
[18:38:22] <ajpiano> it's really good at like, letitng you write style rules that apply to elements no matter when they are created
[18:38:55] <queso> ajpiano: can jquery do it?
[18:39:19] <ajpiano> in the sense that one can use jquery to write style rules dynamically, yes
[18:39:27] <kborchers> ajpiano: css? is that like a plugin or something?
[18:39:36] <ajpiano> in the sense that it can create inline styles on elements that aren't there yet, no
[18:39:43] <ajpiano> kborchers: i think so
[18:39:46] <kborchers> heh
[18:40:16] * kborchers goes back to work instead of lurking and making smart ass comments
[18:40:28] * ajpiano too
[18:40:50] <seancurtis> queso: umm I don't want to sound insulting but why on earth do you want to use jquery to do that?
[18:42:58] <queso> seancurtis: to have the style self-contained in my app
[18:43:38] <seancurtis> doesn't your app have a css file already?
[18:44:11] <queso> nope
[18:44:19] <John_Dee> http://jsfiddle.net/8Hppq/  can someone help me figure out how to make this cycling continue indefinately?
[18:44:24] <coldhead> csv?
[18:44:40] <coldhead> indefinitely*
[18:44:55] <John_Dee> loop forever
[18:45:12] <queso> seancurtis: I assumed that css was part of the dom, but perhaps not.
[18:45:47] <seancurtis> queso: huh? If your app/plugin is going to run on any arbitrary site then maybe it should attach a stylesheet itself?
[18:45:52] <miketaylr> while (true) {loop()}
[18:46:01] <queso> seancurtis: it seems like it would be easier to have the stylesheet actually modified rather than individually finding every element and applying it to it.
[18:46:57] <acalbaza> from the jquery docs in the "data" section - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring... each public method that wants to access "data" uses the foreach idiom.. is this always necessary in all cases?
[18:47:11] <acalbaza> return this.each(function(){
[18:47:17] <seancurtis> queso: what you really want to do is just attach your own styles to the page when the JS app initialises?
[18:47:42] <queso> seancurtis: yes, and without a separate request
[18:47:55] <miketaylr> acalbaza: kind of, since a jquery collection can be 1 or more dom elements
[18:48:52] <seancurtis> queso: print out a style element - something like this: http://www.rickardnilsson.net/post/2008/08/02/Applying-stylesheets-dynamically-with-jQuery.aspx
[18:50:30] <queso> seancurtis: yeah, I've done that before to accomplish something similar, but the browser still has to go fetch it.  it's not a big deal, I suppose.
[18:50:39] <queso> seancurtis: I just wish it were possible. :)
[18:50:58] <queso> seancurtis: but perhaps it is a browser limitation
[18:51:35] <seancurtis> queso: just put the css inside the element instead of linking elsewhere
[18:51:46] <miketaylr> or go for the ghetto document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('style').innerHTML = "foo {bar:baz}")
[18:52:27] <queso> miketaylr: ah, I guess that's what I wanted
[18:53:02] <miketaylr> but i don't think you can actually do all that in one step, you'd have to create it, then set it's innerHTML, then jam it in, etc.
[18:53:37] <seancurtis> queso: http://jsbin.com/inuyit
[18:54:03] <danielt84> could anyone spare a moment to help me with  a callback?
[18:54:05] <danielt84> http://jsfiddle.net/TBchp/
[18:54:30] <queso> seancurtis: there we go
[18:54:33] <coldhead> miketaylr: just like making love
[18:54:52] <danielt84> pretty please
[18:54:54] <miketaylr> coldhead: just like middle school
[18:55:02] <queso> thanks :)
[18:55:02] <seancurtis> queso: you might want to create the element and then change the contents using .text() - unsure if the append method is bad practise XSS-wise
[18:57:04] <danielt84> could anyone spare a moment to help me with  a callback?
[18:57:06] <danielt84> http://jsfiddle.net/TBchp/
[18:57:08] <danielt84> pretty please
[19:01:43] <danieliser> jay: you still on?
[19:02:20] <danieliser> have a div that im using like an iframe essentially, all links inside it load new content to it. Works great.. How can i add an effective back button to that container? there will be multiple instances of these vframe widgets
[19:02:22] <danieliser> any ideas?
[19:03:52] <danielt84> target="blank in the href"? how is the content being appended.
[19:04:08] <danielt84> sorry target="_blank"
[19:04:17] <seancurtis> danieliser: take a look at the jQuery BBQ plugin - that should allow you to do it - I doubt it'll be simple though...
[19:05:19] <initself> i'm trying to use $.extend
[19:05:23] <initself> http://scsys.co.uk:8002/144003
[19:05:34] <danieliser> danielt84: content is being loaded into its parent '.vframe' container. I need an organized way to have a seperate back button and que for each .vframe
[19:05:42] <initself> really i want to just merge two "associative arrays", if I can call them that
[19:05:58] <initself> what is the 0, 1, 2 in the output?
[19:06:04] <initself> why don't i just get key value pairs?
[19:06:35] <danieliser> looked at BBQ initially.. it allows for multiple containers but they are all qued together.. so click a link in 1 then another.. back button undoes them in order.. i need each containers que seperate
[19:06:38] <ae86-drifter> hey, i'm using this bit of code $('#toolbar-top').stop().animate({ backgroundColor: rndCol()}, 800);, but the #toolbar-top element has a background image and color set with css and doesn't work unless i remove it from the css file, anything i can do?
[19:07:29] <seancurtis> ae86-drifter: what's not applying?
[19:08:02] <ae86-drifter> the background color isn't changing, so basically that peice of code doesn't work unkless i remove the css attributes
[19:08:05] <seancurtis> initself: can you do a better demo on jsbin/jsfiddle instead?
[19:08:18] <seancurtis> ae86-drifter: is the background image transparent? link to a demo?
[19:08:21] <danielt84> could anyone spare a moment to help me with  a callback?
[19:08:23] <danielt84> http://jsfiddle.net/TBchp/
[19:08:56] <initself> why does jsfiddle default to MooTools and not jQuery?  Seems wrong.
[19:09:01] <seancurtis> danielt84: maybe cut your demo down to pinpoint the problem - and just ask the question or point out the problem in the demo rather than just asking if people can help
[19:09:20] <ae86-drifter> seancurtis: sorry i have it running locally, but yes, the background image is a transparent png, this is the css the element has 	background:#254360 url('img/pen_hi.gif') no-repeat top center;
[19:09:30] <ae86-drifter> sorry i mean transparent gif
[19:09:42] <seancurtis> and the js background isn't applying?
[19:09:44] <danielt84> ok basically i want those little blocks to $('div').remove('#productContainer' + i + ''); once they've completed their path
[19:10:26] <ae86-drifter> seancurtis: yes, correct, the background color is not updating from jquery, the shorthand css background propery seems to take priority
[19:11:02] <danieliser> any ideas how i could code up my own container back button and que? i even thought of using iphone like slide animations to load pages and go back
[19:11:11] <danielt84> someweird happens with the callback tho where it's happening before the loop not after it
[19:11:21] <seancurtis> danielt84: I think you need to use a closure - inside the for loop do something like var ii = i; then do #productContainer + ii
[19:11:36] <seancurtis> if you console.log(i) you'll see they all end up the same number
[19:11:43] <seancurtis> closures break my brain sometimes :)
[19:12:00] <danielt84> nice thanks for the lead i'll have a look
[19:12:04] <seancurtis> ae86-drifter: do you have !important anywhere?
[19:12:14] <ae86-drifter> nowhere
[19:12:24] <seancurtis> ae86-drifter: inspect the node in firebug and make sure you see a style attribute appear on the heading
[19:12:47] <seancurtis> ae86-drifter: strip everything back so you isolate the element - remove other styles and stuff - looks right
[19:12:55] <initself> I tried doing my test with a query param, doesn't seem to work:
[19:12:57] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/scrPt/?test=1
[19:13:04] <initself> i use window.location in my code
[19:13:17] <initself> just trying to get p to end up with key/value pairs.
[19:14:30] <seancurtis> initself: shouldn't get_query_params(this); be this.href?
[19:14:45] <seancurtis> oh nm
[19:14:48] <seancurtis> sorry didn't see
[19:14:48] <initself> well i pass in something that has .href
[19:15:17] <seancurtis> initself: not sure - sorry :(
[19:15:34] <initself> did you at least look at it with Firebug?
[19:15:41] <initself> and then look at the object?
[19:15:49] <initself> 0   "quote_num"
[19:15:55] <initself> quote_num "1111111"
[19:16:00] <initself> What's the 0 "quote_num" about?
[19:16:12] <initself> first element in the array?

[19:20:34] <ae86-drifter> seancurtis: works, thanks i had a stupid mistake, i was editing a copy of a file that i wasnt even testing on
[19:20:59] <ae86-drifter> my code was perfect i just put it in the wrong file lol
[19:21:06] <seancurtis> ae86-drifter: heh
[19:25:40] <seancurtis> initself: not sure - arrays and objects aren't my strong point - ok with selectors/dom manipulation but that's it :(
[19:30:01] <ae86-drifter> is there something i can tell an animation to make stop() have no effect on a certain element
[19:30:15] <Eviltwin> ae86-drifter: Uh...why?
[19:30:23] <ae86-drifter> i just have ONE particular animation that must NEVER be stopped
[19:30:38] <hesh> cant u do them individually then?
[19:31:11] <ae86-drifter> individually?
[19:31:28] <hesh> sorry ignore that , wrong channel lol
[19:32:01] <coldhead> LOL HESH
[19:32:17] <ae86-drifter> i have one element, one animation that slides it from a to b, another that changes it's background color, if i want the background color ani to be stopabble but the sliding animation unstoppable
[19:32:48] <danieliser> did anybody have any ideas about my $.load target div having a back button? do i need to append each new load in an ordered list maybe?
[19:33:44] <hesh> i need tofind a better irc client
[19:33:46] <danieliser> checking ids to make sure that each content type isnt already loaded.. if it is remove it and add the new copy to the end?
[19:33:57] <danieliser> try xchat?
[19:35:18] <hesh> yeah maybe, anything that can auto login and change the font
[19:35:36] <danieliser> xchat loads all my rooms automatically
[19:36:03] <danieliser> only thing i have to do is sign into nickserv with my pass
[19:36:20] <hesh> leme get that a crack
[19:37:58] <seancurtis> ae86-drifter: only way I can think of how to accomplish that is to wrap the colour animation in an if statement (if animatColour = true) then with your animation stop it where it is, invert the flat (animateColour = false) and then kick off the animation again from where it is
[19:38:49] <webguynow> I've got an  form.submit event function defined  and   using  $(this)  seems to bug out, where   this    seems to work fine
[19:39:50] <webguynow> I really just notice in my Console  there were some warnings   'ID/Element  used in global scope, please use  document.getElementById()'
[19:40:20] <webguynow> FF / firebug is my environment
[19:41:23] <sixohquad> webguynow: are you using validation as well? i think there's a note in the documentation about recursion, maybe someone can clarify, or maybe im just making things up, either or, i'm sure somebody will quickly point out a fault i've made
[19:41:24] <sixohquad> lolz
[19:42:27] <webguynow> perhaps I'm referring to the input field by name  - not by ID - and that's why it's Warning
[19:43:23] <Spadeski> webguynow mind for pm ?
[19:43:36] <webguynow> this.my_field_name.value   seems OK (but throws Warning)    but using  $(this)   halts the javascript
[19:45:36] <Kamakazi> If I have string something5that is there any easy way to get just the number from that string?
[20:13:28] <wreel> kamakazi: regex?
[20:35:52] <coldhead> RADIAL GRADIENT I THINK I LOVE YOU
[21:54:44] <georgeblazer> hi there, does anybody know of a good modal window lib that's tiny? i'm using prettyphoto, but it's like 35K
[21:54:45] <georgeblazer> i need something that only does one thing, create a simple modal window
[22:13:50] <AfroTurf> pre jquery 6.1 to check if an attribute exists what can i do?
[22:32:59] <infid> hey, when i create a jquery mobile sample page, none of my header/content/footer is styled. even though it's linking locally my downloaded version of jquery mobile .css and .js, yet it works fine when i do it from the CDN version. Any idea why?
[22:34:17] <coldhead> i think that's a "feature", infid
[22:34:27] <coldhead> there's some function you need to call to restyle things
[22:34:37] <coldhead> juha_ knows
[22:34:57] <coldhead> and wookiehangover but he's not around :(
[22:40:09] <infid> coldhead: nah because it works fine if i use the same code but with CDN includes rather than local includes
[23:05:05] <Genesis730> when you use   $.getJSON('file.php'), {   how can you test that the php file is executing properly?  or see where it's failing?
[23:08:48] <Genesis731> anyone?
[23:09:02] <User99> hi, i want to create a login box using jquery. is this done using core jquery or jquery ui?
[23:09:40] <Cork> User99: delends, if you just want a form you don't need ui
[23:09:48] <Cork> if you want something like a dialog you need ui
[23:10:26] <Cork> User99: use $.get instead
[23:10:28] <User99> Cork: just a box where user can enter email and password and check/uncheck remember me.
[23:10:53] <Cork> Genesis730: getJSON will try to parse the responce as json, and fail the responce if its not valid
[23:10:58] <User99> Cork: $.get?
[23:11:03] <Cork> ?.get
[23:11:03] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[23:11:19] <Cork> User99: might remeber the wrong ajax shorthand
[23:11:21] <Cork> one min
[23:11:44] <Cork> User99: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[23:11:46] <User99> Cork: ok i think you mistaken what i mean. i would like a user to click on a tab which opens a login box using jquery.
[23:12:10] <Genesis731> well i have an image i want to change a value in a DB with... the code stores the variables and should pass them this php file to sanitize and run queries... after the JSON, i have an animation to see if the code got there, and it shows it gets there without error, but the update doesn't happen :(
[23:12:15] <Cork> ugg, sorry $.get was for Genesis730 :)
[23:12:46] <User99> Cork: yeah i was totally like wtf...
[23:12:49] <Cork> Genesis730: you know the getJSON is async right?
[23:13:12] <Cork> Genesis731: so you need to use its callback
[23:13:25] <Genesis731> I'm really new to jQuery, so i don't really know what async is...
[23:13:40] <Cork> User99: so create a form with the fields and show hide it when you want it
[23:13:54] <Cork> Genesis731: its not jquery related, its how ajax works
[23:14:07] <Cork> Genesis731: the request is sent to the server, your code continues to execute
[23:14:19] <Cork> the responce comes back, and the callback is called
[23:14:23] <User99> Cork: I want something more like a popup login box that shows up on top of content.
[23:14:25] <Cork> ?.getJSON @ Genesis731
[23:14:25] <bot-t> Genesis731, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [callback]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[23:15:13] <Cork> User99: and i've told you two ways to do that
[23:15:34] <Cork> a hidden block that you show, or jquery-ui dialog
[23:15:39] <Cork> its your choice
[23:16:18] <Cork> (btw jquery ui will need a hidden block for the form too)
[23:16:30] <User99> Cork: can you control the jquery-ui dialog so that its not resizeable?
[23:16:56] <Cork> ?dialog @ User99
[23:16:57] <bot-t> User99, UI/API/1.8/Dialog - Overview Options Events Methods Theming jQuery UI Dialog Overview A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog
[23:17:21] <Cork> ugg thats old
[23:17:45] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[23:18:58] <User99> Cork: i've never done jquery ui. do you have to download the jquery ui library or is it part of jquery core?
[23:19:13] <Cork> its a separat package
[23:19:40] <User99> Cork: no worries. how do i check if i already have the package installed?
[23:20:12] <Cork> User99: check if you have jquery-ui*.js and the css files included in the header
[23:20:31] <User99> Cork: ok
[23:22:52] <User99> Cork: there seems to be like 20+ themes...
[23:23:27] <User99> Cork: how is one suppose to know what theme to download?
[23:24:01] <Cork> ?themeroller @ User99
[23:24:02] <bot-t> User99, UI/Theming/Themeroller - http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Theming/Themeroller
[23:27:51] <K1ng> how do if(numbers are 2 4 6 8 10) true?
[23:28:59] <User99> Cork: do you know if you can stop dialog from resizing?
[23:29:48] <ajpiano> User99: dialog({resizable: false})
[23:30:02] <wreel> K1ng: rephrase?
[23:30:11] <Genesis731> so i've determined that it's after the JSON call that nothing else gets executed :(  this is what I have... the HTML is the file.php
[23:30:22] <etfb> What's the difference between "this" and "$(this)" in an event handler?
[23:30:23] <User99> ajpiano: hi. and can you remove the title?
[23:30:29] <Genesis731> K1ng, you mean determine if the number is even?
[23:30:36] <K1ng> yes
[23:30:38] <ajpiano> User99: best is to do it with CSS
[23:30:41] <ajpiano> IIRC
[23:31:07] <K1ng> Genesis731, yes
[23:31:13] <User99> ajpiano: you mean make it not resizable by CSS?
[23:31:22] <ajpiano> huh
[23:31:24] <Genesis731> i know how to with PHP :( not jQuery
[23:31:28] <ajpiano> i mean that dialog has a resizable option
[23:31:33] <ajpiano> you want to disable it, i presume?
[23:31:44] <ajpiano> User99: i mean you should hide the titlebar by css
[23:31:59] <Genesis731> or JS rather
[23:32:08] <User99> ajpiano: right. why some you disable by js and others by css?
[23:32:24] <ajpiano> User99: because being drag and drop resizable is not something you configure in CSS
[23:32:25] <K1ng> Genesis731, same here :(
[23:32:41] <ajpiano> K1ng: you use the % operator
[23:32:43] <ajpiano> look at this example
[23:32:57] <User99> ajpiano: yes that makes sense :)
[23:32:58] <Genesis731> K1ng, http://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/check-if-number-is-evenodd/
[23:33:20] <ajpiano> ?eval var foo = 3; if ( foo % 2 ) { "it is even"; } else { "it is odd" }
[23:33:22] <Genesis731> fairly similar to PHP
[23:33:22] <bot-t> ajpiano: "it is even"
[23:33:29] <ajpiano> lawl
[23:33:38] <K1ng> lol
[23:33:52] <ajpiano> got it backwards
[23:34:02] <ajpiano> ?eval var foo = 3; if ( foo % 2 ) { "it is odd"; } else { "it is even" }
[23:34:03] <bot-t> ajpiano: "it is odd"
[23:34:06] <User99> ajpiano: i already have jquery 1.6. now when i go to download jquery-ui can i untick core under UI core?
[23:34:09] <K1ng> Genesis731, thanks :)
[23:34:14] <K1ng> if (value%2 == 0) works :D
[23:34:21] <ajpiano> User99: no, that's ui core, not jquery core
[23:34:51] <User99> ajpiano: right so basically download all 31 components to be safe.
[23:35:12] <ajpiano> those are sort of different extremes
[23:35:31] <ajpiano> sure you can do that
[23:36:05] <User99> ajpiano: well i assume thats what most people do?
[23:36:27] <ajpiano> sure if you're just starting development or just want the whole toolkit
[23:36:32] <ajpiano> go for it
[23:36:45] <Genesis731> but that may take a bit to load onto someones computer
[23:36:54] <Genesis731> when visiting your site
[23:37:03] <ajpiano> i'm just saying that there's a medium between "ditch the core" and "download everything just to be safe"
[23:37:29] <coldhead> and that medium is to use flasj
[23:37:31] <ajpiano> (if you're concerned about load time...)
[23:37:34] <coldhead> flash*
[23:37:57] <User99> flash is faster than jquery UI?
[23:39:31] <coldhead> depends on the browser, User99
[23:39:43] <Genesis731> i would appreciate it if someone could look at what i have.. maybe find why it's not working??  http://jsfiddle.net/23KQJ/
[23:40:10] <Genesis731> HTML is the file1.php  file
[23:40:51] <ajpiano> what about it isn't working
[23:41:18] <Genesis731> once it gets the $.getJSON('file1.php'), {    it stops
[23:41:32] <User99> is jsfiddle able to take jquery ui to make test cases?
[23:42:02] <ajpiano> yes User99
[23:42:23] <ajpiano> User99: you have a parenthese in the wrong place
[23:42:33] <ajpiano> i mean, Genesis731
[23:42:40] <Genesis731> where at?
[23:43:02] <ajpiano> Genesis731: you're saying $.getJSON("file1.php");  END OF COMMAND.  oh by the way, here's a comma and then an object
[23:43:17] <User99> ajpiano: but in framework i only see jquery up to 1.6.3
[23:43:25] <ajpiano> User99: right.....
[23:43:37] <ajpiano> and then you can click on jquery ui
[23:43:41] <User99> ajpiano: nothing about jquery-ui, which i thought is a separate library
[23:43:50] <ajpiano> it's on top of jquery
[23:43:53] <ajpiano> first pick jquery
[23:44:01] <ajpiano> you can also in clude any js/css resources you wan using the add resource tab
[23:44:25] <Genesis731> ajpiano, what tells it end of command   $.getJSON('file1.php'), {
[23:44:30] <ajpiano> Genesis731: http://jsfiddle.net/23KQJ/1/
[23:44:32] <Genesis731> or how should it be written rather
[23:44:42] <Genesis731> nvm :) i'll look
[23:44:58] <User99> ajpiano: thanks i had to click jquery 1.6.3 and then check jquery ui checkbox
[23:45:00] <ajpiano> Genesis731: aFunction( "its", "arguments", "go", "in", "between the parens" );
[23:45:07] <Genesis731> OH
[23:45:08] <Genesis731> :)
[23:45:09] <ajpiano> lol
[23:46:01] <niftylettuce> anyone here try mediaelementjs or jplayer?
[23:46:12] <niftylettuce> well, jplayer right now is what im focusing on -- trying to get it to run in chrome
[23:46:34] <niftylettuce> I got mime types all okay, using h5bp, and it runs fine in firefox
[23:47:11] <niftylettuce> I guess I could JSFiddle :)
[23:47:28] <Genesis731> still doing the same thing :(
[23:47:37] <Genesis731> after the $.getJSON  nothing gets executed
[23:47:57] <ajpiano> Genesis731: is the call even being executed
[23:48:01] <ajpiano> are you even debugging your code
[23:48:30] <bb_ricardo|work> hi
[23:48:32] <ajpiano> Genesis731: you might want to look through see ?ftj
[23:48:32] <bot-t> Genesis731, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[23:49:07] <SPYGAME> hey guys, i'm trying to send an ajax callback using $.ajax but it seems something's wrong with my code but i don't get any error as well. here's my code http://pastie.org/2530373
[23:49:23] <SPYGAME> please take a look and let me know
[23:49:52] <Genesis731> i got Data is null  error on line 14 if (data.error == false) {
[23:50:29] <bb_ricardo|work> someone up for it on helping an opensource project with a little code contribution icinga.org
[23:51:53] <ajpiano> Genesis731: i'm not looking at your code executing so i don't see that error
[23:52:02] <ajpiano> you have to like, sort of learn how to figure out what is happening in the environment
[23:52:45] <Genesis731> i understand that, i've been doing PHP for a few years now.. just getting into JS, jQuery, AJAX, etc....
[23:52:56] <ajpiano> right, well, no time like the present
[23:53:02] <Genesis731> so the syntax is kinda, very different :P
[23:53:19] <ajpiano> SPYGAME, what do you mean "send a callback", i think you mean "send a call'
[23:53:29] <ajpiano> SPYGAME: does the API you're requesting actually support JSONP
[23:53:44] <ajpiano> lol
[23:53:46] <ajpiano> no
[23:53:51] <ajpiano> you definitely can't POST jsonp
[23:54:03] <ajpiano> i don't think you quite understand what that "crossdomain" optoin does
[23:54:16] <SPYGAME> ajpiano: can you explain further?
[23:54:42] <ajpiano> SPYGAME: the only way to do "cross-domain ajax" within $.ajax is to do JSONP
[23:54:46] <ajpiano> which isn't, in fact, AJAX at all
[23:55:00] <ajpiano> it's doing a GET of an external resources and sticking it in a script tag
[23:55:00] <Genesis731> i think it's just the syntax of trying to return $data['error'] back into JS
[23:55:05] <ajpiano> and that is the JSONP
[23:55:30] <ajpiano> SPYGAME: crossdomain: true isn't just like "hey, magically make this work cross domain"
[23:55:49] <User99> does anyone see anything on jsfiddle working from this sample code taken from jquery ui? http://jsfiddle.net/LmFQF/
[23:55:59] <ajpiano> SPYGAME: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-aj-jsonp1/
[23:56:05] <rhizmoe> ugh, i have a media player that wants {foo:"bar"}, but json is {"foo":"bar"} ...is there anyway to unquote the keys, or otherwise manipulate them into form?
[23:56:08] <SPYGAME> ajpiano: but even if i don't use crossdomain the problem is still there, it does not send a call
[23:56:32] <ajpiano> SPYGAME: that's cause you can't do cross domain ajax otherwise
[23:56:46] <ajpiano> you won't be able to do a POST to http://whatever.com/cause/itsanother/website
[23:57:07] <SPYGAME> ajpiano:  then what's the solution for this?
[23:57:17] <ajpiano> rhizmoe: those should be identical things in js, quoted keys are optional in JS
[23:57:44] <rhizmoe> firebug gives a parseerror when the keys are unquoted
[23:57:49] <rhizmoe> s/gives/shows/
[23:58:46] <ajpiano> User99: including the HTML and CSS Helps
[23:58:48] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/LmFQF/1/
[23:58:56] <rhizmoe> as an argument to the function, it's used like this: this.media = $.extend({}, media);
[23:58:57] <ajpiano> rhizmoe: they're optional in JS... they're required in JSON
[23:59:16] <rhizmoe> ahhhh
[23:59:31] <rhizmoe> (i think)
[23:59:36] <ajpiano> so assuming you've parsed all the json into objects, everything should be fine
