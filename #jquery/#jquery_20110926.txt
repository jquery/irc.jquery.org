[00:02:13] <sayyestolife> Hi.
[00:04:06] <sayyestolife> Is it possible to do a "document.location.href=url+'?foo='+bar" and also send parameters via POST? If so, how do you do that?
[00:06:28] <faraway> sayyestolife: if you want to send a post you can do it either with ajax (no page reload) or by creating an invisible form with the corresponding input elements and trigger a submit on it
[00:08:28] <faraway> sayyestolife: but you should test the triggering a form submit with js, in the different browsers. imho you at least need an "submit" input element in the form to get it work with IE
[00:12:21] <sayyestolife> hmm okay
[00:12:54] <Nomikos> Can I not use an attribute selector like '[style*="border: 0"]' in the .not() method?
[00:16:56] <Nomikos> http://jsfiddle.net/UQshT/ - why doesn't the not() filter find the 0-border?
[00:18:10] <Nomikos> Oh.. it works in jQuery edge.
[00:18:49] <ryanseddon> Nomikos: you can use :not() in your selector
[00:19:57] <Nomikos> ryanseddon: that works better, it seems.
[00:20:30] <Nomikos> ryanseddon: cheers!
[00:22:07] <Titosemi> god morning guys
[00:22:52] <coldhead> take it to #religion, church guy
[00:23:34] <Nomikos> He didn't specify which god :-)
[00:38:41] <hmbg> so, ajaxStart is fired when an ajax requests starts, if no other ajax request is currently running. Is there another event that is fired when an ajax request starts, even though another ajax request is running?
[01:20:44] <defendguin> i'm having a bit of trouble with validation on an asp.net form
[01:21:02] <defendguin> i don't think it is even trying to validate
[01:30:26] <angelkoilov> lool ask questions
[01:30:30] <angelkoilov> sooo boring...
[01:31:23] <coldhead> why is a raven like a writing desk?
[01:34:39] <defendguin> how do i stop an asp.net form from posting if i fail the validation?
[01:35:04] <defendguin> just seems to keep going....  i've got several groups on radio buttons
[01:37:45] <coldhead> depends how you're doing the validation
[01:37:58] <coldhead> if you're binding to submit
[01:38:02] <coldhead> and doing it yourself
[01:38:11] <coldhead> event.preventDefault()
[01:38:18] <coldhead> and or a return false
[01:40:05] <defendguin> i'm using the validation plugin   submitHandler: function() { alert("Submitted!") }
[01:40:08] <defendguin> whoops
[01:40:28] <defendguin> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[01:41:04] <coldhead> so either you're not using it right
[01:41:12] <coldhead> OR maybe your form is actually valid?
[01:41:24] <coldhead> wanna pastebin the code you're using to apply the validation?
[01:41:46] <defendguin> i think it is coming up and saying the form is valid even thought it is not
[01:42:44] <defendguin> http://pastie.org/2593070
[01:43:16] <defendguin> i put the submit handler just to see if it was actually running or not and it appears as though it is passing
[01:44:36] <defendguin> i guess the question is how do i do required on a radio button group like that
[01:45:01] <defendguin> i think asp.net removes the "packageType" from the final markup
[01:45:11] <defendguin> planSize  etc etc
[01:45:24] <e-anima> if i see that right, the jquery ui accordiaon can not be forced to be somehow horizontal?
[01:50:25] <coldhead> defendguin: you can check with firebug or web inspector to see what the actual live markup in the page is
[01:50:35] <coldhead> i'm not sure how to validate radio groups either
[01:50:40] <defendguin> coldhead: i have
[01:50:45] <coldhead> but at worst you can write your own rule
[01:50:58] <coldhead> check the doccs
[01:51:02] <defendguin> I may have to do that
[01:55:32] <defendguin> uggggggg
[01:55:46] <coldhead> uh oh
[01:56:11] <defendguin> you think there would be a very simple way to do this by now
[01:57:27] <defendguin> it's not like this is some secret thing that no one ever uses
[01:58:52] <coldhead> i'd cling to that intuition, defendguin
[01:58:57] <coldhead> there must be an easy way
[02:00:58] <chrislabeard> is there a way to "disable" a select field but make it only show the text and no select field, I have the values are pre selected.
[02:01:40] <defendguin> coldhead: got it
[02:02:43] <defendguin> asp.net is modifying the name of the controls   i need to do something like this <%= #somecontrol.Name %>   something like this
[02:03:14] <coldhead> i pity you, defendguin
[02:03:25] <coldhead> i haven't worked with asp but it sounds terrible
[02:03:35] <defendguin> eh
[02:03:41] <defendguin> it makes other things easy
[02:04:19] <coldhead> swings and roundabouts
[02:04:22] <coldhead> good luck with it!
[02:09:01] <defendguin> done!
[02:10:11] <james13433> If I have some code like <li><a href="http://www.website">Burgundy Rugs</a>(137)</li>
[02:10:22] <james13433> How would I get the (137) part?
[02:10:58] <coldhead> yay!

[02:14:20] <coldhead> how dare it, james13433
[02:14:34] <james13433> I know, I clearly stated remove a!
[02:15:29] <coldhead> sorry james13433, my logic was a little off

[02:15:38] <Trisox> :D
[02:15:40] <coldhead> that guy
[02:15:46] <coldhead> you need to use find() and end()
[02:15:49] <coldhead> which is even grosser
[02:15:52] <coldhead> but it works <3
[02:16:48] <james13433> Thanks coldhead.

[02:36:21] <bot-t> Not much dude, jus’ hangin’ ’n’ chillin’
[02:39:29] <xp_prg> hi all, I am doing an ajax call and I am populating a div with id="output" I want to put in an href that is bound to an ajax function, I don't know how to dynamically add an href then bind a function to it, can I do that all at once?
[02:41:04] <bjensen> how can I find out the index of my current node compared to its siblings? As in 'what number children is it? '
[02:44:03] <dytrivedi> ?index @ bjensen
[02:44:05] <bot-t> bjensen, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[02:46:06] <dytrivedi> xp_prg: use append, etc. to insert a new link
[02:46:19] <dytrivedi> and then use .bind/.live to bind a function to it
[02:46:28] <thonder> hey I am using sortable with tabs
[02:46:46] <thonder> and it turns out the tab method 'remove' is not working when using sortable
[02:47:11] <xp_prg> dytrivedi thanks, I just used bind write after I appended
[02:47:12] <thonder> $tabs.tabs( "remove", index ); does nothing when the tabs are sortable
[02:47:19] <thonder> when i remove sortable it works
[02:47:30] <dytrivedi> xp_prg: np
[02:47:58] <dytrivedi> thonder: are you taking a stand for your code? or are you running a confusion racket?
[02:48:24] <dytrivedi> life doesn't give you choices my friend, YOU CHOSE THE PROBLEM
[02:49:08] <dytrivedi> now invite for yourself a new possibility in a new realm of being, that your coads will work flawlessly
[02:50:06] <thonder> dytrivedi : the code is too complex for me to reproduce at jsfiddle
[02:50:18] <dytrivedi> also understand that life is empty and meaningless and it's empty and meaningless that it's empty and meaningless.
[02:50:28] <thonder> just wanted to know if any known problems while using sortable and tabs together
[02:52:44] <thonder> never mind thats a bug http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4524
[02:53:05] <dexter_e> Catalog of 100 upload switchable images... Create 100 individual forms with ID ?
[02:53:14] <dytrivedi> thonder: just where I landed - http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4524
[02:53:39] <dexter_e> I want to be able to switch each image with an upload form.. Should I be creating 100 separate forms or is there a better way?
[02:53:59] <thonder> so u know any plugins for this? me already googling
[02:54:07] <thonder> letme know if you have one
[02:54:30] <dytrivedi> umm I haven't worked much with UI so maybe somebody else would be in a better position to guide you!
[02:54:47] <dytrivedi> dexter_e: you're using 'em for captcha or something?
[02:54:54] <TheCode> any idea why this is not catching the other tag: /(<(\S+).*>.*<\/\1>)/g.exec('<b>ok</b> and <i>ita</i>')
[02:57:03] <dytrivedi> TheCode: umm I don't know if iszak/ben_alman are around... you can maybe try asking in #regex?
[02:58:11] <TheCode> regex failed to deliver
[02:58:15] <dytrivedi> aww
[02:58:30] <dytrivedi> .seen iszak
[02:58:31] <hsbot> iszak was seen 1 hour, 44 minutes and 55 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Remote host closed the connection
[02:59:13] <TheCode> regex is like the hidden secret ancient chinese shaolin kungfu techique
[02:59:27] <dytrivedi> haha yeah
[02:59:59] <dytrivedi> like the 36th chamber of shaolin
[03:00:25] <TheCode> more like the 3nth chamber, when n is an unknown number

[03:08:04] <WH0RU> I need help with jQuery "one" event
[03:09:06] <dytrivedi> WH0RU: what is it, my son?
[03:11:43] <WH0RU> problem is I want to execute certain event only once
[03:11:52] <WH0RU> <div id="message-tags-reply-4e804e7c3b9f1" class="message-tags-reply">         <form method="post" action="/index.php/messages/updatetags" id="message_tags_form4e804e7c3b9f1">        <input type="text" name="Messages[tags]" value="" id="message_reply_tags_4e804e7c3b9f1" class="text" style="display: none;" autocomplete="off"><div class="textboxlist" style=""><ul class="textboxlist-bits"><li class="textboxlist-bit textboxlist-bit-edita
[03:11:55] <WH0RU> srry
[03:12:02] <WH0RU> http://jsfiddle.net/6CTXf/1/
[03:12:13] <WH0RU> plz have a look
[03:13:47] <WH0RU> on live update $(".message_reply_tags_toggle").one("click", function(e) { .... doesn't get executed
[03:14:02] <WH0RU> but if I make it $(".message_reply_tags_toggle").live("click", function(e) {
[03:14:25] <WH0RU> it works but on every click divs are generated
[03:14:32] <WH0RU> i.e. on 1st click 1 div
[03:14:43] <WH0RU> 2 click 2 divs and so on for same content
[03:17:09] <dytrivedi> WH0RU: try binding one inside the success of initial request
[03:17:20] <WH0RU> ??
[03:18:10] <dytrivedi> when $(".message_reply_tags_toggle").one("click", function(e) { will get executed, will .message_reply_tags_toggle be attached to DOM?
[03:19:13] <WH0RU> yes
[03:19:41] <WH0RU> the div itself is generated from AJAX request
[03:19:56] <xp_prg> hi all, I want to load a div with the entire contents of a specific url, is there some easy way to do that?
[03:20:06] <xp_prg> in this example it is a logfile.txt
[03:21:38] <dytrivedi> WH0RU: the div will be generated when the AJAX request is complete (and it's asynchronous). So you must bind .one() inside that AJAX request's success callback.
[03:21:48] <dytrivedi> ?load @ xp_prg
[03:21:49] <bot-t> xp_prg, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/

[03:30:16] <al`x> hello jquery people.  sorry if this isn't directly a jquery question, but in the following code will myfunc() ever be called?  var Ajax; if (Ajax && (Ajax != null)) { myfunc(); }
[03:31:07] <angelkoilov> why dont u just test it ?
[03:31:14] <dytrivedi> Y U NO TEST IT?
[03:31:30] <dytrivedi> and yeah, this ain't no jquery question
[03:32:04] <blackspotwiggins> considering people ask for asp.net and php help here, it's close enough
[03:32:09] <bjensen> I need to select my grandparents children with a specific index and class. So Im doing this: sumElement.parent().parent().find(".pct:nth-child(" + myIndex  + ")").each(function(k) {    but according to the doc I'm doing it wrong..I just can pinpoint how to fix it
[03:34:36] <hoangtranwork> @bjensen: consider goto granparent with .parents()
[03:34:59] <bjensen> hoangtranwork: but the trouble is in the nth-child imo..
[03:35:37] <hoangtranwork> ah, yes, this is not about identifying grand pa, sry
[03:36:02] <bjensen> its about identifying the right children
[03:36:19] <hoangtranwork> and with 2 criteria, index + class
[03:37:29] <al`x> angelkoilov: dytrivedi: sorry that this isn't a jquery question.  i guess what i want to know is if javascript would allow for the variable 'Ajax' to have been set elsewhere, so testing it may not be useful
[03:38:22] <bjensen> hoangtranwork: well I could just do nth child
[03:39:16] <angelkoilov> al`x: var ajax  === use variable local
[03:40:26] <dytrivedi> testing for undefined may help
[03:40:37] <al`x> angelkoilov: thanks :) that's very clear now
[03:43:43] <hoangtranwork> @bjensen: from the doc, I think nth-child index base on his own parent, instead of the grandparent, maybe eq() is what you need in this case?
[03:44:47] <sustanirc> q
[03:47:06] <bjensen> hoangtranwork: hmm let me try
[03:51:14] <bjensen> hoangtranwork: sumElement.parent().parent().find(".pct").eq(myIndex).each(function(k) {  hmm that didn't work…The problem is that I am in a sum td. And I need to summon up the tds with the same index
[03:51:35] <bjensen> hoangtranwork: but I need to travel to the table node and then do my find there
[03:52:51] <hoangtranwork> ah, hmm, then your first approach look good to me also o.O
[03:53:35] <soee> how can i check if element with some id exists and only than run some code ?
[03:53:59] <bjensen> sore if($(".foo").length() > 0) {}
[03:54:37] <bjensen> #foo for the foo id
[03:57:53] <blackspotwiggins> bjensen, soee if ($("#foo").length) {} is better
[03:58:14] <bjensen> ah. I just like being more explicit :)
[03:59:02] <hoangtranwork> @bjensen: how about trying with td:nth-child(index), and I notice that nth-child is 1-indexed, hmm
[03:59:39] <soee> blackspotwiggins, thank you
[03:59:54] <bjensen> hoangtranwork: this is my complete code: http://pastie.org/2593523 I color the tds red the ones I find: http://pastie.org/2593523
[03:59:55] <hoangtranwork> because maybe .pct appears on some unexpected elements that we missed?
[04:01:09] <blackspotwiggins> bjensen, length is a property
[04:01:19] <blackspotwiggins> not a function
[04:01:29] <ruby_on_tails> hi
[04:01:37] <ruby_on_tails> how do i redirect the user to a page with some post data ?
[04:03:05] <dytrivedi> ruby_on_tails: create a hidden form and submit via JS
[04:03:40] <hoangtranwork> @bjensen: could you give some sample output html
[04:03:49] <ruby_on_tails> dytrivedi: some better option ?
[04:04:16] <bjensen> got it working
[04:04:24] <dytrivedi> ruby_on_tails: I don't think there's an elegant solution
[04:04:35] <bjensen> hoangtranwork: sumElement.parent().parent().find("td.pct:nth-child(" + (myIndex + 1)  + ")").each(function(k
[04:04:39] <ruby_on_tails> dytrivedi: there is a lot of post data, loaded up as url params from the DB
[04:04:46] <ruby_on_tails> GET was working fine, but now need post
[04:04:55] <hoangtranwork> great
[04:05:10] <bjensen> hoangtranwork: thanks!
[04:05:33] <hoangtranwork> Nevermind, I learned from this too, :)
[04:11:15] <pijulius> hi guys, sorry to disturb, does anyone know how to refer to the same element I'm within? for e.g. <div><script>jQuery(this).html('alma');</script></div>
[04:11:31] <blackspotwiggins> pijulius, you cant do that
[04:11:33] <pijulius> what I'm trying to do is put a content to the exact location where the script is
[04:11:56] <blackspotwiggins> document.write is and extremely bad practice
[04:11:59] <blackspotwiggins> an*
[04:12:01] <pijulius> blackspotwiggins: yep, it seems so, so the only way is to point an id or class to it?
[04:12:06] <blackspotwiggins> yes
[04:12:29] <blackspotwiggins> you are not supposed to put script tags in random places inside html
[04:12:36] <blackspotwiggins> you could, but it's bad
[04:13:56] <pijulius> :) what i'm trying is duplicate the recaptcha div so I can have a recaptcha in ajax request forms too as recaptcha isn't allowing two captchas side by side so I have to duplicate and I was thinking on simply replacing it's new location with the already loaded captcha but then it seems I will have to use some pointer and then point jquery to it
[04:14:13] <pijulius> thanks for your quick help! it's really appreciated
[04:18:09] <ryan_sp> hey, I'm applying a background colour to an ul li, can I stop query applying the background to any children ?
[04:18:49] <beepbeep_> ryan_sp, you could try using the :not selector
[04:23:04] <dytrivedi> ruby_on_tails: any children, as in?
[04:23:14] <dytrivedi> oh sorry, wrong nick
[04:23:21] <dytrivedi> ryan_sp: any children, as in?
[04:23:29] <dytrivedi> li inside li?
[04:23:47] <ryan_sp> dytrivedi: li with ul li instead it, i.e. 3 nested ul menus
[04:23:59] <ryan_sp> only want to apply the background to the top level ul li
[04:24:08] <dytrivedi> ryan_sp: use $('ul > li')
[04:24:37] <dytrivedi> better, descend from a parent and use that
[04:28:20] <dismist> what event is fired when a p area changes text?
[04:29:50] <beepbeep_> dismist, not 100% sure but I'd think none.
[04:30:16] <dismist> what would be the best way to check when the content of an element changes
[04:30:17] <dytrivedi> ?g mutation events jquery @ dismist

[04:40:43] <nathggns> Say I have a element with position hidden, is there anyway that I could detect when somone drags a select region to the end of the visible text?
[04:42:47] <Cork> nathggns: don't dubble post, one channel at a time
[04:44:00] <Segaja> Cork: he didn't what is the problem with asking this in 2 channels?
[04:44:18] <troubleman> Segaja: nothing man
[04:44:29] <Bower^> http://pastebin.com/zCqeFSy5 - That's my code that handles ajax searching on my site. It all works except the aborting of old queries. Can someone please take a look through that code and see why it isn't aborting old queries? bloody thing
[04:44:31] <Cork> Segaja: multible ppl start answering the same question in different channels
[04:44:31] <troubleman> Cork is just a faggot, put him on ignore or some shit
[04:44:46] <Segaja> Cork: that is then his problem to sort out the right answer.
[04:44:49] <Cork> Segaja: and don't get any responce cause he's busy talking in the other channel
[04:44:53] <troubleman> Cork: oOoOo no MULTIPLE PEOPLE HELP HIM NOOOOO!!
[04:44:55] <Cork> Segaja: then you end up chashing him
[04:45:11] <Segaja> if he doesn't answer me anymore i see the case as closed...
[04:45:16] <Cork> troubleman: its not multible ppl helping, its not knowing that someone else is alreayd doing it
[04:45:25] <Segaja> i had the same discussion once about ##php on freenode and #php on efnet...
[04:46:02] <Segaja> Cork: i would probably do the same. sometimes i ask both php channels for some help for example
[04:46:29] <Cork> Segaja: a hint its a good way to get ppl that spend a lot of time doing this to ignore you
[04:46:37] <Cork> me fore example
[04:46:55] <Cork> (the biggest reason is, its rude)
[04:47:09] <Segaja> i don't see why it is
[04:47:14] <Cork> ask the question in on channel wait say... 10-15 mins and ask in the next
[04:47:23] <Cork> thats fine, but not multible channels at the exact same time
[04:47:42] <Cork> give ppl a chance to answer before you ask in the next channel
[04:47:48] <Segaja> well now he has 2 channels with no answer.
[04:48:03] <Segaja> again i don't see the problem
[04:48:12] <Cork> Segaja: ya, instead of one answer
[04:48:37] <Cork> now i don't answer until i get a sign of life from him
[04:48:41] <Segaja> nathggns: it might work with some onmouseenter event
[04:51:25] <Bower^> http://pastebin.com/zCqeFSy5 - The problem is that xhr objects stored within the collection aren't being aborted when a new request is made. Can anyone see the problem? :/
[04:52:16] <Segaja> Bower^: line 116
[04:52:22] <Segaja> for(var i = 0; i < xhrCollection[i]; i++)
[04:52:30] <muzone> lol @ Cork
[04:52:30] <Segaja> the index on xhrCollection
[04:53:23] <ryan_sp> hey, can anyone see why the alert value is 0 in this bit of code, .sections is right underneath http://pastebin.com/fCmJA7TF
[04:53:23] <muzone> if i ever catch you at a jQuery convention or whatever i will kick the shit out of you you fucking faggot
[04:53:58] <Cork> Bower^: in other words you should have .length and not [i] in that loop
[04:54:00] <youngin> thats the spirit muzone :)
[04:54:15] <Cork> ah muzone's in here :)
[04:54:19] <youngin> and i agree - Cork is an idiot
[04:54:22] <Bower^> oh right, cheers
[04:54:27] <Bower^> silly me
[04:54:28] <Bower^> :D
[04:54:42] <Segaja> ryan_sp: $(this) is the title element and .closest() goes up in the tree
[04:54:48] <Segaja> i think you want .next()
[04:55:28] <Segaja> ryan_sp: you are looking from the title element upwards for an element with the class "sections" which doesn't exist
[04:55:40] <ryan_sp> Segaja: gotcha, thx
[04:56:43] <Segaja> Bower^: or since you use jquery you could do it in a $.each(xhrCollection, function(i, val) { val.abort(); });
[04:57:06] <Bower^> I do need to stop being a nab and use the proper jquery foreach
[04:57:31] <Bower^> now that I have a valid condition i'm getting some weird jquery errors
[04:57:55] <Bower^> "jQuery16100872162352010406_1317038193313 is not a function" is data is input into the field relatively fas
[04:57:57] <Bower^> fast*
[04:59:58] <feuersh> hi
[05:00:05] <Bower^> anyone know what might be triggering this?
[05:00:28] <Bower^> It's like the request is sent then the object to handle the return value is killed
[05:00:49] <Bower^> god damn it
[05:01:29] <feuersh> i try to send an base64 string via ajax, but for some reason the ajax functions replace the strings + and other signs. Does anyone know why?
[05:06:31] <dddbmt> Hi guys. From I understand: With jquery 1.5+ it's possible to make x-domain ajax requests. As long as the target domain accepts a certain http header that makes this possible. How do I send that http header with $.getJSON ? (Please let me know if I've misunderstood something)
[05:07:10] <Cork> dddbmt: its not the server that accepts, its the server that sends a cors header
[05:07:16] <james13433> If I want to get some html, with two divs, and append each div to a seperate place, is the best way to use JSON?
[05:07:17] <Cork> ?mdc cors @ dddbmt
[05:07:18] <bot-t> dddbmt, HTTP access control - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/http_access_control
[05:07:22] <james13433> via ajax btw
[05:08:09] <Cork> james13433: that or parse the dom and cut the elements
[05:08:16] <Cork> james13433: but ya, i would go with json
[05:08:32] <james13433> ok thanks Cork
[05:08:37] <Cork> np
[05:08:39] <dddbmt> Cork, So I don't need to send anything in my script?
[05:08:50] <dpy> hi guys
[05:08:54] <Cork> dddbmt: no the browser looks for the cors response
[05:09:01] <Cork> dddbmt: the script don't have to do anything
[05:09:20] <dddbmt> Cork, okay - thanks a lot for making that clear to me :)
[05:09:26] <Cork> dddbmt: alternativly you might be talking about jsonp
[05:09:35] <Cork> dddbmt: but its not new at all
[05:10:10] <dddbmt> However, I still need to send another http header (a token for api I'm trying to recieve data from). Can I send http header with jquery ajax request?
[05:10:23] <Cork> yes
[05:10:29] <dddbmt> Cork, it's not jsonp.
[05:10:34] <Segaja> $.ajax()
[05:11:12] <Cork> dddbmt: you can set headers in the before callback
[05:11:23] <nathggns> Right this might piss people off, I had to go so I didn't see if i got any help
[05:11:24] <Segaja> the docu on $.getJSON() has an equivalent $.ajax() call in it. you can use that and there you can add headers IIRC
[05:11:25] <nathggns> Say I have a element with position hidden, is there anyway that I could detect when somone drags a select region to the end of the visible text?
[05:11:43] <dddbmt> Cork, thanks. I'll try check up on that. Might come back with a few more questions though! ;)
[05:11:53] <Segaja> nathggns: as i said before: it might be some onmouseenter event
[05:11:58] <dddbmt> Segaja, Okay - I'll keep that in mind. Thank you very much :)
[05:12:03] <Cork> nathggns: do you mean visibility: hidden; or display: none; position doesn't have hidden
[05:12:27] <nathggns> err
[05:12:29] <nathggns> overflow*
[05:12:33] <Cork> lol
[05:12:45] <Segaja> wow that changes the question a lot
[05:12:52] <Cork> ya
[05:13:03] <Segaja> i would still try some mouse enver events or so
[05:13:32] <dpy> Suppose you have the following ui.sortable scenario:  Two connected lists with items. A user drags an item from one sortable list and drops it in the other sortable list. This generates two 'sortupdate' events, one for each list.  My code, however, just expects one event and simply reads both lists again.   What is a good way to merge those two events and handle them as one?
[05:13:34] <Cork> nathggns: as far as i can remember there isn't a way to tell word positions in an overflow situation
[05:13:38] <nathggns> but I would know if im selected :/
[05:13:51] <Cork> nathggns: so you might have to add extra markup
[05:14:41] <Segaja> dpy: prevent one event and let the second continue?
[05:15:47] <shabbaranks> trying to add a datepicker into a wordpress site (Im a complete noob) any chance of some help please?
[05:16:15] <james13433> for JSON whats the equivilent to data say to append one and two {   "one": "Singular sensation",   "two": "Beady little eyes"}
[05:16:53] <dpy> Segaja: how do you know when to prevent one?  Suppose you only drag/drop within one list, then there will never be a second...
[05:17:11] <Segaja> ah hm..
[05:17:13] <shabbaranks> <?php wp_enqueue_script("jquery"); ?>
[05:17:13] <shabbaranks> <?php wp_head(); ?>
[05:17:16] <shabbaranks> oops
[05:17:23] <shabbaranks> Ive added those to my header
[05:17:32] <dddbmt> Cork, will I need "jQuery.support.cors = true;" for x-domain request, as according to http://blueonionsoftware.com/blog.aspx?p=03aff202-4198-4606-b9d6-686fd13697ee ?
[05:17:58] <Segaja> shabbaranks: and does the html that is created contain the jquery js files?
[05:18:03] <dpy> Segaja: I was thinking of just handling every event and checking if the new event yields any changes
[05:18:15] <Segaja> dpy: that is one idea
[05:18:16] <dpy> Segaja: but then you will do stuff twice
[05:18:24] <shabbaranks> @Segaja I have moved the js to the js folder
[05:18:36] <Cork> dddbmt: that forces it on, and will fail for opera
[05:18:40] <Segaja> dpy: you could define a time frame. if in this frame the second event is fired, ignore it
[05:18:59] <dpy> sound tricky
[05:19:06] <dpy> timing is quite machine dependent
[05:19:11] <Segaja> shabbaranks: that wasn't my question. when you look at the html source of your WP, do you see the <script ..> tags for the jquery js files?
[05:19:16] <dpy> if a browser is slowed down
[05:19:22] <Segaja> dpy: true.
[05:19:25] <dpy> you get all sorts of strange behavior
[05:19:30] <Segaja> dpy: you could make it a singleton
[05:19:46] <Segaja> don't process an event if a processing is underway
[05:20:04] <Segaja> that way if two events from both lists are fired as nearly the same time one will be blocked
[05:21:57] <Segaja> dpy: but i'm not sure it will work properly
[05:24:28] <ronnyhaase> hi. anybody from the jquery ui devteam here who could maybe answer a question or two regarding the next release?
[05:25:08] <shabbaranks> Segaja this is the code http://pastebin.com/gH3S134L
[05:25:48] <Segaja> shabbaranks: i don't know jsDatePicker but the code looks fine enough
[05:26:26] <james13433> Should this alert something? http://pastebin.com/YryB2VKq
[05:26:42] <james13433> I can see its getting the file successfully in firebug
[05:27:04] <Segaja> james13433: it should.
[05:27:20] <james13433> DHmm...
[05:28:30] <james13433> no error messages, yet nothing.
[05:30:58] <james13433> Does it need ton be successful to run that function?
[05:31:15] <james13433> If so whats "successful"?
[05:31:57] <james13433> because im using 1.4.2?
[05:34:11] <dpy> Segaja: the answer is to use sortstop
[05:34:21] <dpy> It is only ever triggered once.
[05:34:36] <Segaja> james13433: the callback is for the success case. that means the server returns the request url with header 200
[05:34:41] <Segaja> dpy: ah i see
[05:35:12] <james13433> Segaja, yer th\ats what I though, I get the "200 OK 		3.09s" yet no alert :(
[05:36:45] <Segaja> james13433: sorry but i have no more ideas at the moment and need to get back to work
[05:37:02] <james13433> riht ok.
[05:37:13] <james13433> Anybody else, have any ideas/
[05:39:52] <james13433> response is fine also, { nav:"221", content:"2343" }
[05:43:17] <james13433> 		jQuery.ajaxSetup({   "error":function() {        alert("error"); }}) makethis alert dunna what that means tho
[05:44:44] <james13433> Invalid JSON: { nav:"221", content:"2343" }
[05:48:07] <erichynds> james13433: { "nav":221, "content":2343 }
[05:48:37] <james13433> Thanks erichynds just realised tht now.
[05:48:58] <james13433> pain in the a*** that I ahve to make my own error output for JSONP
[05:51:46] <james13433> Any advice on passing html with JSON?
[05:52:28] <erichynds> yeah, don't :)
[05:52:52] <erichynds> build your HTML in javascript
[05:52:55] <erichynds> using templates
[05:57:28] <james13433> escaped ' and " and / yet still invalid
[05:58:33] <erichynds> james13433: you should use something to generate the json for you - like php's json_encode()
[05:58:42] <erichynds> james13433: and use jsonlint.com to ensure it's correct
[05:58:51] <james13433> Ahh json_encode :)
[06:00:22] <james13433> and to unencode in jQuery ?
[06:01:51] <rgr> I am using animate() to enlarge and then shirnk back some images based on hover. But whats the best way to ensure the img is returned to its original size? Is there some kind of animate "store attributes" method?
[06:07:17] <erichynds> james13433: jQuery does it for you
[06:07:29] <erichynds> james13433: but you can do it manually with jQuery.parseJSON()
[06:07:33] <james13433> ahh nice,
[06:07:57] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: just the person I didn't know I wanted to see that I wanted to see!
[06:08:20] <erichynds> hihihihih!
[06:08:32] <jeffsmykil> trying to create an object formatted like this:  http://pastebin.com/c3kRY2MA
[06:08:41] <jeffsmykil> but objects still make my brain hurt
[06:09:42] <jeffsmykil> can I do that?
[06:10:32] <jeffsmykil> oops erichynds ^^^^
[06:10:43] <erichynds> umm
[06:10:47] <erichynds> you need to wrap the keys in quotes
[06:10:52] <erichynds> if they contain spaces like that
[06:10:59] <Bower^> Urgh. Why does xhr.abort() trigger the .error function?
[06:11:04] <Bower^> is that normal?
[06:11:41] <James-_> hello i want do a simple thing but this not work
[06:11:43] <erichynds> Bower^: yeah
[06:11:44] <James-_> http://jsfiddle.net/Cy32S/6/
[06:11:48] <danzik17> Bower^: Believe so - aborting it certainly isn't successful =P
[06:11:57] <Bower^> danzik17, hahaha fair point
[06:12:04] <erichynds> Bower^: but the first parameter to your callbacks will read "abort" i believe, so you can tell
[06:12:12] <James-_> i want my form stay on modal
[06:12:14] <merlin_1991> hey not exactly a jquery question, but on my page I got a header that is 1 div containing 3 divs of wich the left and the middle one has float:left to make it 3 column layout, but now if one of the divs gets bigger in height it's box does not resize the main div containing them all
[06:12:49] <Bower^> erichynds, I didn't think of that. I'll have a play, thanks

[06:13:49] <codecowboy> Hi. AM getting an error in IE only (8) which says "Permission denied" and quotes line 6244 Char:2. It's occuring when adding a jquery UI dialog. Anyone seen this before or have any suggestions on how to troubleshoot?
[06:14:37] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: ya
[06:14:50] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: holy shut my syntax is right?
[06:14:57] <erichynds> yeah
[06:14:59] <erichynds> YEAH BRO
[06:15:05] <codecowboy> jquery version is 1.6.2 ^^
[06:15:19] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: its a christmas miracle
[06:16:10] <Bower^> erichynds and danzik17, ok it's pretty much working now. the only problem is that I'm getting jQuery errors like the following: "jQuery16102738177502233803_1317042885749 is not a function" - is THIS normal?
[06:16:51] <erichynds> Bower^: sounds like you're not returning valid JSONP
[06:17:00] <erichynds> you need to wrap the JSON in a callback
[06:17:39] <Bower^> erichynds, http://pastebin.com/q4yEa6Mz
[06:17:50] <James-_> anyone can help me plz
[06:17:51] <James-_> http://jsfiddle.net/Cy32S/6/
[06:17:53] <Bower^> It's the .abort() calls that trigger these jQuery errors
[06:18:14] <rgr> I have an img element. But img.width(w) isnt doing anything. What obvious thing am I overlooking?
[06:18:17] <Bower^> It's like the request was sent and a reply has been received but the callback function no longer exists
[06:18:21] <Bower^> like the .abort kills it
[06:18:27] <Bower^> i dunno
[06:18:37] <erichynds> Bower^: change type to jsonp
[06:21:32] <Bower^> seems the lastfm api doesn't accept jsonp format
[06:21:39] <Bower^> it works fine without the aborts though?
[06:21:42] <James-_> erichynds ?
[06:23:26] <strike> Hello.. I don't know how to actualize this.. I'll make up an example:
[06:23:41] <James-_> jeffsmykil can you help me with that plz : http://jsfiddle.net/Cy32S/6/
[06:24:01] <jeffsmykil> James-_:  trust me man, you don't want me helping you
[06:24:12] <Bower^> haha
[06:24:31] <James-_> ?
[06:24:32] <jeffsmykil> wait what is this supposed to do
[06:24:38] <jeffsmykil> to much foreign language
[06:25:02] <James-_> load a modal dial with a form and when i submit the form alert ok and the modal stay open
[06:25:15] <jeffsmykil> well the modal dialog is disapearing
[06:25:19] <James-_> yes
[06:25:28] <jeffsmykil> im not familiar with dialog
[06:25:28] <James-_> he must not disapearing
[06:25:32] <jeffsmykil> i usually append a div
[06:25:46] <jeffsmykil> id have to read the dialog documentation
[06:26:40] <strike> I have a dynamic table-list of products. They are categorized with different parameters for example: one product can have: "car, blue, new" or "bicycle, yellow, new" or "car, yellow, old". Now the question comes here: I wan't to have "checkbox-buttons" (car, bicycle, | blue, yellow, | new, old) that if I check only car and yellow --> it should show only all cars which are yellow.
[06:26:46] <jeffsmykil> oh its a jqueury UI thing James-_
[06:26:54] <jeffsmykil> James-_: isnt there a jquery ui page?
[06:27:06] <strike> or if I check only "old" --> it should display only all old products (doesn't matter if it is car or bicycle or which color)
[06:27:13] <James-_> yes it s a jqueryui dialog
[06:27:23] <James-_> but i don t understand why this disapear
[06:29:35] <Efazati> i have http://pastebin.com/fs9mK8Am ... this code select all input in page and send it via ajax request
[06:29:41] <Efazati> i have error
[06:30:00] <jeffsmykil> james i thin k there is a jquery ui try asking in that irc room
[06:30:49] <James-_> ok jeffsmykil thx
[06:30:56] <Efazati> i have error like this obj.attr is not a function
[06:31:03] <jeffsmykil> James-_: sorry Im just not familiary with the UI stuff
[06:31:16] <jeffsmykil> ive been rolling my own modal dialogs
[06:31:23] <James-_> k why ? it s not optimized ?
[06:31:24] <jeffsmykil> which now that i seee this seems rather stupid
[06:31:27] <quicksilver> Efazati: you want $(obj) in both cases.
[06:31:33] <jeffsmykil> no because i didnt know about this
[06:31:40] <James-_> ok ^^
[06:31:45] <quicksilver> Efazati: obj is a DOM object not a jQuery object.
[06:32:20] <Efazati> quicksilver, :D eyval its work
[06:32:26] <Efazati> tanks quicksilver
[06:34:10] <ccmonsters> HOLA KIDS
[06:37:05] <jeffsmykil> if i need to push to a second layer of an object what is the syntax for that...

[06:37:47] <AdTaylor> Hi. I was wondering what the general feeling/wisdom in the community is with using data attributes to call plugins (al a Dojo or twitter)? It seems like a nice way to initiate widgets but it's lack of adoptions must point to some downfalls… right?
[06:37:55] <virtualint> and i cant run datepicker on the form
[06:37:58] <virtualint> what should i do?
[06:38:17] <jeffsmykil> virtualint: I know absolutely nothing, but did you try using .live?
[06:38:27] <virtualint> i used delegate
[06:38:37] <virtualint> i guess they have the same job
[06:38:57] <jeffsmykil> as I said I know nothing, and that was my only suggestion
[06:39:01] <virtualint> jeffsmykil: let me look at it
[06:39:06] <virtualint> i ll tell the result
[06:39:08] <virtualint> thanks
[06:40:26] <xtcxtcxtc> hi all, i've a problem with firefox loading an external .asp page
[06:40:38] <xtcxtcxtc> anyone can help?
[06:40:59] <red> How do I get an #elements binded events? Like if a button has a click event I wan't to see what that is :)
[06:41:12] <red> Need to get one certain buttons events, and override them
[06:41:50] <xtcxtcxtc> images returned with <img src="..."> have a strange delay
[06:42:03] <xtcxtcxtc> only in firefox (version 6.01)
[06:42:23] <pachet> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/6uPej/ ?
[06:42:41] <xtcxtcxtc> images are from facebook profile pictures
[06:43:54] <jeffsmykil> ty pachet so i can do counts.FacilityId[i].push(Equipment);
[06:45:35] <jeffsmykil> or will simply adding the third layer value add the third layer?
[06:45:39] <jeffsmykil> 		counts.FacilityId[i].Equipment == 1
[06:46:58] <pachet> well, im not sure about the [i] accessor, but yes, adding a property to an object will instantiate that property array
[06:47:17] <jeffsmykil> pachet: ty big help
[06:48:25] <pachet> i guess technically that array already exists via the object prototype, but isnt exposed within the object instance until you add something to it
[06:48:39] <pachet> *geek*
[06:49:13] <jeffsmykil> basically a dictionary with js objects... no fun
[06:59:21] <TrueColors> Small issue: http://87.102.70.193/projects/clients/Jeanette_Clement/Cyber%20Mentors/content.html ... on the right, you can click the arrows and... magic happens. But if you were to click them fast... the height changes.. and eventually they don't slide down as far as what they should.
[06:59:29] <TrueColors> I kind of know why this happens, it's the same with fadeOut and opacity.
[06:59:45] <TrueColors> but I tried doing: $("#dashboard .modContent").css("height", "auto").stop(true).slideUp(400);
[06:59:48] <TrueColors> resetting the height.
[06:59:51] <TrueColors> but it's not working
[07:02:52] <TrueColors> hm it seems to be removing the padding
[07:04:28] <pachet> TrueColors: http://jqueryfordesigners.com/animation-jump-quick-tip/ might be relevant
[07:05:04] <TrueColors> I'm on the latest.
[07:05:05] <seutje> yea, don't animate shit with padding on it
[07:05:18] <seutje> and for the sake of your sanity, don't try to animate tables too much :P
[07:05:38] <TrueColors> tables?
[07:05:46] <TrueColors> there is no tables :P
[07:05:49] <TrueColors> but yeah.. I'm needing the padding... hmm
[07:05:59] <TrueColors> I mean I can reset the padding.. and the height as they both seem to be a problem
[07:06:32] <seutje> aw shit, newer versions animate padding as well?
[07:06:50] <TrueColors> they must do.
[07:06:55] <TrueColors> they animate mine.. lol
[07:07:12] <seutje> fancy shit!
[07:08:27] <TrueColors> resetting the height and padding fixes it...
[07:10:04] <virtualint> jeffsmykil: hi
[07:10:06] <virtualint> i used delegate
[07:10:16] <virtualint> and now i dont know how to stop prepagation
[07:10:23] <virtualint> and undelegate does not do what i want
[07:10:38] <jeffsmykil> I bet pachet  is more suited to answer your question
[07:10:57] <Brodingo> ?stoppropogation @ virtualint
[07:10:58] <bot-t> virtualint, event.stopPropagation() - This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[07:12:13] <virtualint> http://pastebin.com/kb1tdBwJ
[07:12:37] <virtualint> pachet sorry
[07:12:49] <virtualint> i did not see your message and windows has been closed and no logging :P
[07:12:57] <virtualint> may i get your answer again pls
[07:13:21] <Brodingo> the event delegation is on the body
[07:13:33] <Brodingo> not the .ui-widget-overlay
[07:13:34] <virtualint> is it possible to do it in another element
[07:13:59] <virtualint> but when i say undelegate all of the events stop to work also :)
[07:14:18] <virtualint> $("body").undelegate(); seems odd to me
[07:14:25] <virtualint> did i get wrong Brodingo
[07:14:26] <virtualint> ?
[07:14:28] <pachet> why do you want to undelegate them
[07:14:47] <virtualint> because i binded it to hover function to be able to load the rte and the datepicker
[07:14:59] <virtualint> when the user hover the .ui-widget-overlay
[07:15:03] <virtualint> function runs
[07:15:07] <virtualint> sorry the event is fired
[07:15:22] <virtualint> is there a better way to do taht
[07:15:27] <virtualint> that
[07:16:20] <Bower^> http://pastebin.com/ggG2A0Zt - Can anyone help me figure out how to prevent jQuery throwing "function doesn't exist" errors when I .abort() xhr objects?
[07:16:35] <pachet> well, why dont you put $(this).unbind("hover") in your function, right after $('.datepicker').datepicker();
[07:16:55] <virtualint> pachet:  let me try it
[07:17:07] <Chib> no! someone stop him!
[07:17:17] * Chib lunges for virtualint 
[07:18:24] <pachet> tbh, you should probably just parse your ajax results and call your plugins on the returned $('.datepicker') elements from that set
[07:19:05] <pachet> success: function(data){$('.datepicker', data).datepicker();} in your ajax arguments or similar
[07:19:05] <virtualint> Chib whats the problem?
[07:19:09] <virtualint> pachet: no it does not work
[07:20:39] <Segaja> Bower^: i would guess that currentXHR is null or some other thing that doesn't have an abort() function
[07:22:22] <virtualint> pachet: no luck
[07:22:44] <virtualint> thanks i should find a solution thanks for your help
[07:24:56] <Bower^> Segaja, it's the callback function specified in the API url that doesn't exist
[07:25:08] <Bower^> so I guess .abort() makes it null
[07:25:49] <Bower^> it would make sense that it just calls the .error() function and I can just see if it's an abort or server failure
[07:28:21] <Bower^> I can't even seem to catch the error
[07:28:35] <Bower^> It functions absolutely fine besides that error being generated in the console
[07:28:52] <emattias> How do I collect a bunch of elements (jqeury objects) to loop through them later? $collection = $(); and $collection.add($('#foo')); doesnt work..
[07:33:00] <jeffsmykil> pachet: surprise! it didn't like http://172.16.0.131/skyView3/MapService/altMap.htm
[07:33:32] <seutje> emattias: works fine here -> http://jsfiddle.net/rK22n/
[07:34:09] <seutje> emattias: or wait, did u think $collection would be altered when adding?
[07:34:18] <seutje> it just returns the combined collection
[07:34:49] <emattias> seutje: yup I need to add several elements to a colelction in a loop and later act on every element in the colelction
[07:35:02] <seutje> so ur prolly looking for $collection = $collection.add('#foo'); (also note that u don't *need* to pass a jQ collection, might as well just pass a selector as a string)
[07:35:13] <mattmitchell> Anyone doing any server side testing using jQuery? I had Rhino and Env.js all working, but only with older versions of jQuery. I recently had to update jQuery and now nothing works :(
[07:37:13] <pachet> jeffsmykil: page isnt loading
[07:37:25] <jeffsmykil> ?
[07:37:51] <pachet> timing out in the browser
[07:39:04] <pachet> brb cigarette
[07:42:18] <jeffsmykil> Im trying to do counts.push(foo[i]); but its giving me counts.push is not a function
[07:43:05] <jeffsmykil> and when setting a breakpoint .push is coming as undefined
[07:43:41] <emattias> tnx seutje, it worked great!
[07:48:45] <krad> hi.  i'm using jquery SOAPClient.. which ends up calling $.ajax .  but it's only sending the request header and not the body .. what could be wrong.. the request is in xml
[07:48:52] <krad> (the body is in xml)
[07:49:38] <DarsVaeda> how can I check if something is the first in a set?
[07:50:51] <danzik17> DarsVaeda: see ?is
[07:50:52] <bot-t> DarsVaeda, .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector and return true if at least one of these elements matches the selector. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[07:51:00] <DarsVaeda> thanks :)
[07:51:53] <axle3d> I keep getting this error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'href' of null" in jQuery, every time I include a twitter widget! What does it mean??
[07:52:41] <jeffsmykil> Double Rainbow?
[07:52:57] <axle3d> jefflembeck: yes
[07:53:40] <jeffsmykil> you sure you are including jquery?
[07:54:27] <pachet> jeffsmykil: counts["foo"+i]=foo[i]
[07:55:27] <axle3d> jeffsmykil: yes, the error points to jQuery's file
[07:58:10] <jeffsmykil> pachet: not sure why that worked and mine didnt
[07:59:15] <jcapinc> hey, anyone know how I can get the xpath of an element, so that I can save it to be re-used later?
[07:59:20] <quicksilver> jeffsmykil: your object probably wasn't an array.
[07:59:35] <jeffsmykil> aha
[07:59:39] <jeffsmykil> so i need to make it one
[08:00:00] <quicksilver> you can create an array with var counts = []
[08:00:11] <jeffsmykil> i did
[08:00:11] <jeffsmykil> member:jeffsmykil: counts["member:foo"+i]=member:foo[i]
[08:00:24] <jeffsmykil> ignore that
[08:00:40] <jeffsmykil> I did car ciybts = {};
[08:00:44] <jeffsmykil> OMFG
[08:00:50] <quicksilver> {} is not [].
[08:00:50] <jeffsmykil> var counts = {};
[08:00:53] <discorpia> jcapinc: usually people use xpath _or_ jquery, since jquery selectors makes xpath redundant. there are however some pure javascript-solutions to generating xpath from specific nodes, like http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/4349 and others as well
[08:00:58] <quicksilver> well taht won't be an array, as  you say.
[08:01:03] <jeffsmykil> will it still be an object quicksilver?
[08:01:09] <quicksilver> arrays are objects.
[08:01:13] <jeffsmykil> cool
[08:01:26] <quicksilver> you should probably find a good javascript book, these are not jquery questions ;)
[08:01:41] <Suzaku> val() or attr('value','foo') both don't work on a cloned element. it doesn't shows the old value in the attribute in firebug, but in the browser it shows the new value in the input field.
[08:02:00] <Suzaku> anyone have any ideas on how to get this to work?
[08:02:22] <jeffsmykil> quicksilver: I have what i thought was one
[08:02:28] <jeffsmykil> and it said to make an obkect with {}
[08:02:33] <jcapinc> discorpia, I am trying to use jquery to get an arbirtrary element, and then I want to store the "address" of where that element is, save it to a server, and use it later.  Xpath seemed like the road to go, but is there a better way to do this?
[08:03:37] <DarsVaeda> I don't understand .is() -> http://jsbin.com/afufet/edit#javascript,html,live
[08:04:23] <DarsVaeda> actually I only want to check if it is the first of all of the .each()
[08:04:42] <Suzaku> basically what happens is, the input[type=text] attribute 'value' is not actually changed, but does show as such in the visual representation of the text field.
[08:05:09] <Suzaku> tested in chrome and firefox
[08:05:21] <quicksilver> DarsVaeda: "Be aware that for selector strings with positional selectors such as :first, :gt(), or :even, the positional filtering is done against the jQuery object passed to .is(), not against the containing document"
[08:05:29] <quicksilver> from http://api.jquery.com/is/
[08:05:57] <danzik17> DarsVaeda: Oh - in that case just use the index variable passed from the .each
[08:06:00] <danzik17> http://jsbin.com/afufet/2/edit#javascript,html,live
[08:07:07] <Suzaku> any ideas at all? :(
[08:07:16] <ch3mical> Morning all
[08:08:16] <ch3mical> Suzaku: what are you trying to figure out?
[08:08:36] <Suzaku> i ran into an odd problem where .val and .attr('value','foo) won't work
[08:08:37] <ch3mical> I scrolled up a bit, something about cloned objects not having a value?
[08:09:03] <Suzaku> i cloned a field, then want to modify the value
[08:09:22] <Suzaku> the visual representation (what it says in the text field in the browser) changes.
[08:09:26] <Suzaku> but when you look in the inspector
[08:09:38] <Suzaku> the value attribute is not changed.
[08:10:42] <ch3mical> Can you show me an example on jsfiddle maybe?
[08:11:06] <Suzaku> hmm maybe
[08:12:10] <pachet> Suzaku: for text fields, the html attribute "value" corresponds to the INITIAL value for that element
[08:13:42] <Suzaku> pachet: i'm setting it by using val('foo')
[08:14:01] <Suzaku> and it changes in the textfield on the screen, but in the inspector it's still the old value.
[08:14:05] <Suzaku> in the actual attribute.
[08:14:33] <jeffsmykil> pachet:  it looks as though setting the object to 1 does not create it
[08:14:58] <ch3mical> Suzaku: but if you do $('input').val() what do you get? The original value or the new value?
[08:17:02] <Sigvatr> http://img78.imageshack.us/img78/7544/chuga19ef7.jpg
[08:17:33] <pachet> Suzaku: val() doesn't set the HTML attribute "value"
[08:17:44] <pachet> it sets the property corollary
[08:17:49] <pachet> http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2011/06/html-difference-between-attribute-and.html
[08:18:01] <Zer000> I've got a problem i'm hoping someone can help troubleshoot: I have this image gallery with sliding thumbnails and i'm unbinding the click events, doing the animation, then rebinding them. The problem is after i unbind i still make click events happen (if i click fast in the browser). what gives?
[08:18:16] <pachet> hence, .prop()
[08:19:32] <ch3mical> Zer000: inheritance?
[08:19:47] <ningia> hi all
[08:19:58] <Zer000> ch3mical, could you be more specific? I"m not using any type of inheritance in my code...
[08:19:59] <Suzaku> pachet: i need to set it with .prop() ?
[08:20:05] <pachet> jeffsmykil: can i see a fiddle
[08:20:19] <ccmonster> so hows things going folks?
[08:20:23] <jeffsmykil> it would take me a while, if i cant figure it out in the net 20 minutes ill make one pachet
[08:20:41] <pachet> Suzaku: you can set it with either. but neither will update that value as you see it in inspector
[08:20:53] <jeffsmykil> pachet: it seems that counts["FacilityId" + i]["Patient"] == 1;
[08:21:02] <jeffsmykil> doesnt work when there is no patient already
[08:21:58] <ningia> I'm using jQuery with <select> dom elements, and I use something of that all the time $("#myselect option:selected").removeAttr ("selected"); $("#myselect option[value=4]").attr ("selected", "selected");
[08:22:05] <ningia> is there a simpler way to do that?
[08:22:39] <ningia> to change the select value?
[08:24:49] <pachet> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/TjzRU/
[08:25:36] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[08:25:41] <jeffsmykil> you preset the values though
[08:26:07] <Suzaku> pachet: how can i best solve this though, i need to clone an object, insert it, change the value, and still keep its clear default value function when focussed.
[08:28:05] <pachet> store the value in .data()?
[08:28:38] <foldedcat> how can I make a jquery ui animation slower
[08:28:39] <stribor> can anyone help me with this snippet of code....it works perfect  when using checkbox but when using radio buttons gives too much space between string and radio button....
[08:28:42] <stribor> http://jsfiddle.net/HHcQn/
[08:28:59] <foldedcat> I'm using jquery ui accordion and it's animating too fast
[08:29:11] <pachet> jeffsmykil: er are you testing equivalence or setting the value ;o
[08:29:23] <d3str0y> Anyone know what the best plugin/method is for switching from a text field to a password field
[08:29:28] <JohnnyDavidson> Does anyone know how to make effecient collision detection?
[08:29:28] <Suzaku> the value needs to be in the textfield though, it needs to be a visual representation of how much characters can be typed in the form field.
[08:29:30] <jeffsmykil> setting value
[08:29:38] <d3str0y> im making an input that has the word Password in it, and when you click it changes from text input to password input
[08:29:50] <d3str0y> and I want it to be as cross browser compatible as possible
[08:29:52] <JohnnyDavidson> I made my own, but it lags my PC really badly when there are like 10 elements that need to be checked
[08:30:24] <webguynow> Re: tablesorter
[08:30:41] <nabax> hi
[08:30:51] <nabax> is there a way to know whether an element has an event bound?
[08:31:08] <pachet> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/e4CWp/
[08:31:14] <Zer000> nevermind, i solved my earlier problem. This was pretty handy http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/debug-jquery-events-with-listhandlers/
[08:31:15] <webguynow> I made a copy of the blue.css and changed all the selector names to an alternative, applying it to a 2nd table, I had built
[08:31:18] <jeffsmykil> i think i may have found the problem
[08:31:41] <nabax> I need to know if a button has a click event already bound or not
[08:31:43] <webguynow> now my rows on both tables are Not striped - Kinda weird
[08:31:48] <aaronmcadam> dammit
[08:31:55] <aaronmcadam> is kborchers around
[08:32:09] <aaronmcadam> need to remove the Ok button from a jquery-ui dialog
[08:32:51] <Suzaku> pachet: perhaps it would be fixed if i also override the defaultValue attribute?
[08:32:59] <Suzaku> since it's cloned from another element with a different value
[08:33:01] <foldedcat> how can you make the jquery ui accordion slower?
[08:33:15] <stribor> can anyone give me any suggestion please
[08:34:13] <webguynow> are there guidelines to follow if using the tablesorter plugin on multiple tables on one page  ?
[08:34:28] <pachet> Suzaku: im not really sure what you're talking about without seeing a fiddle or some such. but i think storing whatever value you want to the cloned element with foo.data('initialValue','whatever'), is your best bet
[08:34:29] <spir> hi!
[08:35:07] <spir> it seems I can't do that in IE : function(){param: $('div.'+$(this).attr('id')).html(),}; Any alternative?
[08:35:16] <Suzaku> alright gimme a sec i'll try
[08:37:23] <pachet> nabax: if ($(foo).data('events')['click']) //its bound
[08:37:33] <pachet> probably gets ugly with live though ;o
[08:37:43] <nabax> pachet, thanks a ton :)
[08:40:15] <jeffsmykil> pachet its my in statement apparently
[08:40:30] <jeffsmykil> if (FacilityId[i] in counts)

[08:42:25] <aaronmcadam> has anyone tried to remove the OK button from a jquery ui dialog
[08:43:01] <aaronmcadam> when passing options
[08:43:14] <aaronmcadam> why does it always show even when I set buttons : null
[08:48:31] <realpap> http://jsfiddle.net/dn4Pp/5/ any idea why the jquery isnt adding the class?
[08:51:38] <realpap> sorry this http://jsfiddle.net/dn4Pp/8/
[08:51:46] <aaronmcadam> gnarf do you know why setting { buttons : null } has no effect

[08:52:20] <nail_> realpap: it does add the class

[08:53:00] <kborchers> aaronmcadam: saw your ? in -dev
[08:53:02] <aaronmcadam> kborchers do you know why  setting { buttons : null } has no effect when initialising a jquery ui dialog

[08:53:08] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[08:53:17] <aaronmcadam> it's misleading
[08:53:32] <aaronmcadam> just calling dialog() with no args doesn't give buttons
[08:53:34] <realpap> omg u r right
[08:53:37] <aaronmcadam> but i want to set options
[08:54:01] <ajpiano> aaronmcadam: doing .dialog({modal:true}) or any option doesn't magically make it have buttons
[08:54:10] <aaronmcadam> what does then?
[08:54:14] <ajpiano> who knos
[08:54:16] <aaronmcadam> I /don't/ want any
[08:54:18] <ajpiano> something you're doing wrong?
[08:54:41] <aaronmcadam> modal: true,  width: 630,  autoOpen: false
[08:54:43] <aaronmcadam> that's all
[08:54:44] <kborchers> hmmm, not sure. why do you need buttons: null when just not setting the buttons option gives you no buttons?
[08:54:52] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't tho
[08:54:55] <aaronmcadam> that's the problem
[08:55:10] <stribor> can anyone help me with this please   http://jsfiddle.net/HHcQn/
[08:55:16] <kborchers> hmm, you have a link or a fiddle?
[08:56:06] <realpap> then why it dont apply the borders? its the same here and it works ! http://jsfiddle.net/dn4Pp/7/

[08:57:09] <kborchers> ajpiano: heh, i just did similar http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/ue5Cu/
[08:57:22] <webguynow> Can addClass() take a huge string representing a descendant selector  ??

[09:01:23] <rgr> is there a way for me to tag a parent element so it doesnt auto resize as I grow its child?
[09:01:57] <rgr> aha resize
[09:01:59] <rgr> doh
[09:04:55] <rgr> no, resize doesnt do it.
[09:05:16] <aaronmcadam> thanks guys, kborchers, ajpiano
[09:05:23] <kborchers> np
[09:06:20] <pachet> rgr: this is more of a css question, but you'll need to set a fixed height/width on the parent
[09:06:25] <kborchers> rgr: what are you trying to do? you want to parent to scroll or just hide the child if it's too big. just use CSS to set the height and width and then overflow: auto for scroll or overflow: hidden for hide
[09:06:34] <_zoggy_> binding a click function to a button.. why wont this work
[09:06:35] <_zoggy_> var theForm = $(this).closest("form"); alert( theForm.attr("id") );
[09:06:37] <rgr> all of jquery is a css thing...
[09:06:45] <realpap> http://jsfiddle.net/dn4Pp/7/ http://jsfiddle.net/dn4Pp/14/ why bot-border:hover stopped aplying in the second one?
[09:06:54] <rgr> no, I want the parent to stay fixed size when an animate function resizes the chikld img
[09:06:59] <rgr> overflow is on
[09:07:09] <Joeys> css
[09:07:14] <Joeys> max-height, max-width
[09:07:27] <Joeys> first-child or a psudo element?
[09:07:29] <rgr> I cant .. I need to do it in jquery as a result of a dynamic selector
[09:07:40] <pachet> just set $(parent).width($(parent).width());
[09:07:50] <rgr> good idea thanks
[09:08:11] <gnarf> pachet: wow...
[09:08:14] <gnarf> :)

[09:09:24] <pachet> zzz?
[09:09:50] <pachet> or better yet
[09:10:02] <pachet> just use width as a function ;(
[09:11:56] <realpap> http://jsfiddle.net/dn4Pp/7/ http://jsfiddle.net/dn4Pp/14/ why bot-border:hover stopped applying in the second one?
[09:12:18] <_zoggy_> http://jsfiddle.net/TCg39/ -- why wont it return the form id ?
[09:12:38] <realpap> oh i forgot the .
[09:13:08] <jeffsmykil> pachet:  why am i getting "3" twice?

[09:14:45] <quicksilver> _zoggy_: your HTML is badly formed.
[09:15:00] <quicksilver> _zoggy_: forms are not permitted to be children of tbodies.
[09:20:39] <stribor> can anyone please take look at this and give me suggestions on how to solve this....http://jsfiddle.net/HHcQn/
[09:21:49] <quicksilver> stribor: "solve" what?
[09:22:01] <brianarn> stribor: You aren't closing your ready function or the $(document).ready call - and that fiddle is using MooTools so it wouldn't quite work anyways.
[09:22:12] <quicksilver> stribor: you're missing the closing { from the outer function and the ); from the .ready...
[09:22:29] <stribor> well it works as it should on checkbox.....but it doesnt for radio buttons....(it gives to much space between apended string and radio button0
[09:22:33] <jeffsmykil> quicksilver: any idea why im getting "3" twice?  http://jsfiddle.net/LX9RS/7/#run
[09:22:51] <stribor> quicksilver: oh thats just because of cutting pasting....
[09:23:00] <stribor> quicksilver: i fixed that and it still giving too much space
[09:23:11] <stribor> works fine for checkboxes
[09:23:20] <stribor> where can i post screenshot
[09:24:01] <quicksilver> jeffsmykil: 'in' doesn't mean what you think it means.
[09:24:10] <wib> stribor: imgur, tinypic
[09:24:14] <jeffsmykil> oh...
[09:24:16] <stribor> give me sec
[09:24:22] <jeffsmykil> should i use inarray?
[09:24:52] <quicksilver> jeffsmykil: yes, you should.
[09:25:37] <stribor>  you see how much space there is between text and radio button
[09:25:41] <stribor> http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2lld2m8&s=7
[09:26:51] <_zoggy_> ty quicksilver, that was it
[09:27:08] <stribor> or its better to see here http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2ec3hwp&s=7
[09:27:58] <pachet> jeffsmykil: when you use in on a standard array, you're checking against the numeric index of that array
[09:28:32] <pachet> so in the case of the 7th iteration of your loop, the function says "i dont see a value at the 3 index"
[09:28:32] <jeffsmykil> what about when you use it on an object?
[09:28:49] <stribor> quicksilver: you see how it works nice with checkboxes   http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=i1gw77&s=7
[09:29:40] <pachet> that would work fine, except you can't .push object properties
[09:30:00] <pachet> well, you could add that function to your object prototype, but !
[09:30:41] <jeffsmykil> oh you cant push obhject properties?
[09:30:44] <jeffsmykil> ooooh
[09:30:48] <jeffsmykil> that makes sense
[09:32:31] <stribor> quicksilver: if you can point me where to look it would be greatly appreciated
[09:32:32] <jeffsmykil> but i can push object values right pachet?
[09:33:03] <gopalK> hi...pls help me on this http://jsfiddle.net/UBM6B/2/
[09:33:19] <gopalK> i'm using jstree to add around 700
[09:33:26] <gopalK> nodes to the tree
[09:33:33] <guy> I was pretty sure that I can do this in jQuery: var bind = elem.unbind('click'); elem.bind('click', bind);
[09:33:44] <guy> but it doesn't work; did something change? how to do this then?
[09:34:05] <gopalK> when I click on "add"
[09:34:08] <ajpiano> guy, that never has worked
[09:34:18] <ajpiano> .unbind has always returnd a jquery object
[09:34:44] <gopalK> aftersometime a dialog asking me to stop the script appears...how can I overcome this?
[09:34:56] <ajpiano> guy: function foo() {};   $("#bar").click(foo);  $("#bar").unbind("click", foo);
[09:35:10] <guy> yeah, this will work,naturally.
[09:35:58] <gnarf> guy: what are you trying to accomplish by doing this?
[09:36:01] <pachet> jeffsmykil: myObj['propertyName']='propertyValue'
[09:36:14] <jeffsmykil> ty
[09:36:25] <TrueColors> http://www2.beatbullying.org/firewalk/CMFixed/content.html - look on the right, click the arrows... it works fine but ... some browsers but in IE8... well, test it for yourself. The result of IE8 is this: http://screencast.com/t/7Ge4Kkxp
[09:36:27] <guy> gnarf: second. will paste bin it in a second. I always doubt whether it is the right way to do this, but I just got used to.
[09:36:32] <TrueColors> What's happening and how can I fix it?
[09:36:52] <jeffsmykil> man whats wrong with me today ive used inArray before now i cant get it to work
[09:36:55] <gnarf> guy: in general, if you're calling unbind - you're prolly doing it wrong
[09:36:59] <francois|work> Is it normal that even after setting "z-index: 9999 !important;" for the datepicker, it still shows behind jquery-ui dialogs?
[09:38:15] <guy> gnarf: see this
[09:38:15] <guy> http://dev.anuary.com/mike-gamaroff/unbreakable-embrace/html2/
[09:38:33] <guy> or this. http://dev.anuary.com/mike-gamaroff/unbreakable-embrace/html2/public/js/frontend/jquery.carousel.js

[09:42:16] <gopalK> when running firebug timestamp the time taken increases from 6ms for the first node to about 63 ms when the stop script dialog appears

[09:47:41] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: someObj["whatever"] = "watever";
[09:47:43] <ajpiano> etc.
[09:47:52] <TrueColors> I don't think I recieved any assistance... IE8 causes this to happen: http://screencast.com/t/7Ge4Kkxp here is the URL of the page having the issue: http://www2.beatbullying.org/firewalk/CMFixed/content.html ... how can I fix this?
[09:47:57] <ajpiano> someObj.wat = "hi";
[09:48:10] <jeffsmykil> jij
[09:48:12] <jeffsmykil> huh
[09:48:14] <jeffsmykil> ok ill try taht
[09:48:25] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: you don't "push" anything into an object, you add new keys
[09:49:14] <pachet> ;o
[09:49:27] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: can you count with the value?
[09:50:17] <ajpiano> huh
[09:50:26] <ajpiano> i don't kno what that means
[09:50:26] <jeffsmykil> nm im not there yet :)
[09:53:51] <pachet> i think you're confused about the distinctions between objects and arrays
[09:56:36] <gopalK> can any one help me on my problem ^^... am I missing something on using jstree with jquery
[09:57:18] <jeffsmykil> i think i need to smash my hesd against a desk
[09:58:08] <jeffsmykil> repeatedly
[09:59:54] <jeffsmykil> pachet: this is my end game
[10:00:01] <jeffsmykil> through itteration and the like
[10:01:53] <jeffsmykil> can a property have three properties under it?
[10:02:41] <pachet> a property key can be assigned to an object, which can have its own nested properties
[10:02:44] <pachet> so yes
[10:03:53] <jmotta> I have a string that was rendered in my html as a return of a db query, but there are double white spaces on it and when I obtain these strings using jquery the double white spaces disappear
[10:06:26] <ngharo> how are you obtaining these strings
[10:09:42] <{-_-\\\> hi
[10:09:46] <{-_-\\\> i have a problem with animate
[10:10:05] <ngharo> i have a problem with women
[10:10:07] <{-_-\\\> i have an error popup which is display via animate({opacity:1},100);
[10:10:13] <{-_-\\\> everything works fine
[10:10:21] <{-_-\\\> however if i leave browser window open for maybe an hour
[10:10:28] <{-_-\\\> then do something - animate doesn't work
[10:10:34] <{-_-\\\> i refresh page and it works again
[10:10:34] <{-_-\\\> wtf?
[10:10:43] <dismist> have you tried updating jquery
[10:10:47] <pachet> ngharo: sounds like you're not getting the callback
[10:10:47] <pachet> hooo
[10:10:54] <{-_-\\\> pachet: and why can it be?
[10:11:01] <Botteu> Hi guys! I'm quite new to JavaScript and JQuery and I'm trying to wrap my head around the in's and out's of the language. I come from an AS3 background so I'm used to building my applications from classes and since there's no such thing in JavaScript, I'm a bit confused...
[10:11:22] <{-_-\\\> this issue appears only when browser window is open for a while without activity
[10:11:42] <{-_-\\\> there are no settimeouts and other stuff running
[10:11:50] <Botteu> the scopes are driving me nuts :/
[10:11:59] <dismist> i remember i created this fader thing that faded quotes in and out in the same area, if i came back to the tab in an hour it owuld be going in hyperspeed
[10:12:05] <{-_-\\\> http://www.trolls.lv/ - try it
[10:12:07] <TrueColors> Botteu, have you tried buying a new Tele for your Scope?
[10:12:12] <{-_-\\\> type something into login box and you will get an error
[10:12:25] <{-_-\\\> but if you leave window for some time and try logging in again - error won't show up
[10:12:28] <{-_-\\\> no errors no nothing
[10:12:32] <{-_-\\\> just nothing happens
[10:13:11] <ajpiano> Botteu: this and the next few slides after it should be helpful in the initial stages at least http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide28
[10:13:19] <ngharo> pachet: haha :)
[10:17:03] <Botteu> ajpiano: thanks
[10:18:49] <jmotta> ngharo, I use this plugin http://www.texotela.co.uk/code/jquery/select/ and call the function selectedTexts()
[10:20:49] <webdev5> you out there dabear?
[10:21:41] <dabear> NOPE
[10:23:15] <webdev5> nice
[10:23:20] <webdev5> sarcastic as usual
[10:23:23] <webdev5> :)
[10:23:42] <webdev5> I'm still struggling with that issue I was having
[10:24:15] <dabear> Ah, yes, like I remember what your issue was :p
[10:25:20] <webdev5> ok ok I"ll do the jsfiddle
[10:26:14] <jmotta> I have a string that was rendered in my html as a return of a db query, but there are double white spaces on it and when I obtain these strings using jquery the double white spaces disappear (e.g. the original string was "something  here" and when I obtain the value I get "something here")
[10:26:59] <jlovel> Hey, anybody here who can help me out?
[10:27:11] <Connor_> Probably
[10:27:17] <jlovel> I need to know how to do the opposite of this:
[10:27:30] <jlovel>  var index=1; var template = $('#some_div').attr('data-prototype');    $('#some_div').append(template.replace(/\$\$name\$\$/g, index));
[10:28:05] <webdev5> http://jsfiddle.net/Xu99P/9/
[10:29:33] <dabear> webdev5: http://jsfiddle.net/Xu99P/10/
[10:29:54] <jlovel> Even if someone could help me understand exactly what is happening in the original function maybe that would help.
[10:29:55] <dabear> is it that hard to realize you need to select the next div, relative to the current element?
[10:30:14] <webdev5> thank you dabear
[10:30:21] <webdev5> I tried next
[10:30:25] <webdev5> I'll try it in my code
[10:30:29] <webdev5> again
[10:30:56] <feathersanddown> Hi, who use jquery validation engine?? http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/jquery-form-validator-because-form-validation-is-a-mess/ I want to know if there is a way to chage date format validation

[10:32:39] <texasmynsted> Anybody use cluetip?
[10:34:06] <texasmynsted> Trying to have cluetip to apply to all tags with a given class with one call
[10:34:20] <jlovel> so... nobody knows how to do the opposite of append on a data prototype attribute?
[10:34:51] <gnarf> jlovel: huh?
[10:35:10] <jlovel> ok I need to do the opposite of this:
[10:35:21] <jlovel>  var index=1; var template = $('#some_div').attr('data-prototype');    $('#some_div').append(template.replace(/\$\$name\$\$/g, index));
[10:35:28] <gnarf> what would the opposite of that be?
[10:35:38] <danagin> hey, I have $('.popupDetails').live("click", function() {... under document ready. popupDetails will only be there once a user has gone a few levels deep into an ajax site. How should I go about only running this if the user control has loaded popupDetail. I'm pretty new with JQ...
[10:35:53] <jlovel> lol idk but in effect it removes some stuff that that other function added to the page
[10:36:14] <danagin> Is there an easy way to say if popupDetail != null?
[10:36:17] <gnarf> jlovel: um - remove it?
[10:36:24] <gnarf> ?remove
[10:36:25] <bot-t> .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[10:36:42] <jlovel> yes, but the same thing with remove doesn't seem to work, which is why I'm confused.
[10:36:55] <gnarf> you can't pass html to remove
[10:36:58] <gnarf> you have to select something
[10:37:16] <gnarf> it depends on what is stored in data-prototype
[10:37:41] <francois|work> Can I pass a variable in a load and retrieve it on the page loaded?
[10:38:44] <jlovel> oh i see
[10:39:14] <FNTom> francois|work; If you define a variable in the global namespace, it'll be available globally.
[10:39:42] <gnarf> francois|work: cookies / localStorage are the only way to pass vars between page loads
[10:39:52] <gnarf> and cookies are wasted space
[10:40:04] <gnarf> you could maybe use a hash/get param
[10:40:10] <jlovel> so could I use remove for this at all? Or use some other function with regexp to strip out the part of data-prototype i don't need?
[10:40:18] <{-_-\\\> hi
[10:40:20] <FNTom> Oh, didn't realise he was talking about between page loads.
[10:40:23] <{-_-\\\> can somebody help me with my jquery bug?
[10:40:36] <gnarf> jlovel: see ?p
[10:40:36] <bot-t> jlovel, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:40:52] <jlovel> kk one sec...
[10:41:52] <francois|work> FNTom: gnarf I'm trying to find the best way to retrieve the address of a ajax page I loaded in a dialog with a .load() to submit the form properly
[10:42:09] <gnarf> francois|work: thats isn't "between page loads"
[10:42:18] <gnarf> francois|work: store it on the dialog's .data()
[10:42:37] <rgr> in javascript/jquery whats best practice to store variables so, for example, it is set in the animate first function and read and used in the second animate function. (I am a jscript beginner pretty much). Hope that is clear. I cant use globals since these animate functions are called for multiple elements simultaneous so I need to keep the variables "element local".
[10:42:51] <ajpiano> rgr: see ?data
[10:42:52] <bot-t> rgr, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/

[10:53:24] <ravenzz> I am looking for a responsive slider (different from flexslider), suggestion?
[10:53:41] <ajpiano> pojo:  you have to show code to get help
[10:53:49] <ajpiano> no one can just magically guess what is wrong
[10:57:58] <avigmati> how to after $('#mydiv').dialog('destroy'); reinit dialog without refreshing the page?
[11:01:44] <pojo> hey i am trying to group elements in select dropdown by adding border to option but not working in IE.  I used option border and image background also to show sepration.but it does no work in IE
[11:02:17] <ajpiano> pojo:  you can't style option elements in IE
[11:02:23] <Eviltwin> Frequently for IE, you have to create a "fake" select with <ul><li>
[11:02:47] <ajpiano> http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ is a good select box replacement that does ^^
[11:03:36] <Eviltwin> Wow, that's beautiful
[11:03:43] <gnarf> pojo:  could you use optgroups ?
[11:04:23] <ajpiano> how is optgroup formed? how select get groupings?
[11:05:16] <FNTom> Now if only chosen did auto complete :D

[11:06:27] <Andy_> hey guys
[11:06:37] <pilotbob> Hi there... can anyone help me with a selector...
[11:06:40] <devinrolsen> You think one day the webkit development tools CSS inspector will alphabetize styles when editing selectors and such (like firebug)?
[11:06:53] <pilotbob> I am using var topMenuItem = $(".ModuleMenu a[title='eFinancials'");
[11:06:56] <devinrolsen> I miss it so much.
[11:07:10] <Eviltwin> pilotbob: Well you're missing the "]" there
[11:07:15] <pilotbob> ...which works fine IN IE but in Chrome I am getting Uncaught Syntax error, unrecognized expression: ='eFinancials'
[11:07:47] <AndyGer> can anybody reproduce this #javascript behaviour? http://jsfiddle.net/7vHpG/5/ Is it a bug (#Safari / #JQuery) or my mistake?
[11:08:31] <Eviltwin> AndyGer: Your bad
[11:08:31] <pilotbob> sorry, this is the line var topMenuItem = $(".ModuleMenu a[title='eFinancials']");
[11:08:47] <Eviltwin> $('#dontwork').click(this.dummyMethod.bind(this)); runs this.dummyMethod.bind(this) and attempts to bind the result to the listener
[11:08:53] <ajpiano> lol
[11:09:03] <ajpiano> AndyGer: Safari doesn't have Function.prototype.bind
[11:09:05] <Eviltwin> Effectively var x = this.dummyMethod.bind(this); $('#dontwork').click(x);
[11:09:27] <AndyGer> Hm. Why it works in chrome?
[11:09:30] <francois|work> How can I add functions to elements that are loaded with ajax? Let's say I have a button with class='submitbut', $(".submitbut").click(function (e) { will not work
[11:09:35] <AndyGer> bind() is a native javascript method
[11:09:38] <ajpiano> AndyGer: because chrome *does* have Function.prototype.bind
[11:09:39] <Eviltwin> Not yet
[11:09:47] <ajpiano> AndyGer: it's not implemented in safari or IE right now
[11:09:48] <Eviltwin> It's native to ECMAScript 5
[11:09:57] <AndyGer> ah okay.
[11:10:04] <ajpiano> AndyGer: you can use see ?jQuery.proxy
[11:10:05] <bot-t> AndyGer, jQuery.proxy(function, context): Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[11:10:06] <ajpiano> to do the same thing
[11:10:17] <AndyGer> ajpiano: i use the proxy
[11:10:25] <AndyGer> in antother line
[11:10:26] <ajpiano> ok
[11:10:28] <AndyGer> and this works
[11:10:30] <AndyGer> have a look at the example
[11:10:34] <ajpiano> yeah,
[11:10:43] <ajpiano> it's not a jquery bug
[11:10:46] <AndyGer> but thanks Eviltwin i didn`t know that this is implemented in ECMA5
[11:10:59] <AndyGer> Where cani find the RFC of ECMAscript 5?
[11:11:03] <Eviltwin> Google
[11:11:20] <pilotbob> Hmm... strange for giggles I tried: var topMenuItem = $('.ModuleMenu a[title="eFinancials"]'); ... does the type of quote mark matter?
[11:12:00] <BleKohl> filter() only looks at the array elements, find() only looks in the descendants of the array's elements
[11:12:05] <BleKohl> Is there something that would work for both?
[11:12:22] <Eviltwin> AndyGer: This is a good explanation of some of the changes: http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-objects-and-properties/
[11:12:59] <Eviltwin> And this: http://ejohn.org/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/
[11:13:13] <Eviltwin> I really don't like the way "use strict"; works
[11:13:25] <Eviltwin> Literals shouldn't be able to make certain black magic happen
[11:13:51] <AndyGer> Eviltwin: thanks, the second link is it!
[11:14:03] <pilotbob> Are selectors supports to be surrounded by single quotes or double quotes? What is the standard?
[11:14:22] <Eviltwin> AndyGer: Also: http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/
[11:14:45] <BleKohl> matchedset.find('*').andSelf().filter(selector); <-- is this the best way?
[11:15:23] <AndyGer> Eviltwin: wow. this table is VERY usefull. thanks for this link!
[11:16:38] <gnarf> BleKohl: match.find( selector ).add( match.filter( selector ) ); = less work
[11:16:49] <AndyGer> Thanks for your fast help Eviltwin / ajpiano !
[11:17:15] <BleKohl> I don't like how your line has the selector twice
[11:17:24] <pilotbob> eviltwin: thanks, apparently it was just the missing ] ... don't know how I didn't see that.
[11:17:27] <gnarf> BleKohl: its WAY less work
[11:17:33] <foldedcat> how do I slow down the jquery UI accordion
[11:18:26] <gnarf> $.fn.findAndFilter = function( selector ) { return this.pushStack( this.find( selector).add( this.filter( selector ) ).get() ); };
[11:18:46] <gnarf> totally .end() compatible then too
[11:19:06] <gnarf> might not need the .get()
[11:19:22] <BleKohl> Well, if it's much less work...
[11:19:42] <gnarf> BleKohl: if you .find( "*" ) you're looping every element inside with the filter statement
[11:20:00] <BleKohl> Yeah, I suppose
[11:20:02] <gnarf> whereas if you .find( selector ) you can take advantage of querySelector if it exists
[11:26:52] <reaby> hi, i'm in dead end with the basics, but how can i access jquery element object ? is it just $(element).html(); ? or element.html();
[11:27:04] <reaby> tried both, not working.
[11:28:30] <gnarf> reaby: the dom element?
[11:28:38] <gnarf> reaby: [0] ?
[11:29:28] <reaby> dom element, yes
[11:29:28] <gnarf> reaby: it is either "this" in the context of like .each() - or you can access the jQuery result like an array - .length, [0] etc... to get at the DOM elements the selector matched
[11:29:34] <gnarf> ?each
[11:29:34] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[11:29:46] <reaby> i have the element saved in json
[11:29:59] <reaby> how i can access it after i have parsed it
[11:30:05] <reaby> like insert it to somewhere
[11:30:07] <Connor_> Is there anyway to put a time stamp on when a console log happens?
[11:30:14] <reaby> that's the problem
[11:30:21] <gnarf> reaby: huh?
[11:30:25] <reaby> i can't just figure it out
[11:30:36] <gnarf> reaby: you have a string with some html?
[11:30:42] <gnarf> and you want to put it somewhere?
[11:30:48] <reaby> yes
[11:30:59] <gnarf> $( html ).appendTo( "#whatever" )
[11:31:10] <gnarf> var element = $( html );
[11:31:32] <gnarf> then poke element into the dom
[11:31:53] <danzik17> gnarf: Can you think of any reason *not* to define $.fn.prop --> $.fn.attr in a 1.5.x install?  Need to convince people that we should upgrade, but at least in the meantime that'd allow the use of the "proper" method
[11:32:37] <gnarf> danzik17: there are minor differences in the return / expected values
[11:33:00] <gnarf> also - removeAttr( "checked" ) would become .prop( "checked", false ) for a good example
[11:33:05] <gnarf> of incompatible
[11:33:59] <danzik17> gnarf: Ah, ok.  I'll just deal then - was trying to figure a way to stop making this hole of "bad" code deeper while I'm trying to convince people for an upgrade, but bugs/weirdness won't be worth it.  Tks.
[11:34:11] <avigmati> how to after $('#mydiv').dialog('destroy'); reinit dialog without refreshing the page?
[11:34:28] <gnarf> avigmati: call .dialog() on it again
[11:34:41] <avigmati> i do but nothing
[11:36:15] <avigmati> only with refreshing a page work
[11:39:08] <caleb_smith> I've got a project that's usinger galleria and I'm having some issues. May be a bit off topic but can't seem to find a #galleria
[11:41:11] <caleb_smith> basically, everything works fine for me in several browsers, but in chrome on Mac, the image shows before being scaled when the user clicks onto the next picture
[11:41:53] <Connor_> Okay, got an issue here. I am doing setTimeout inside a .each yet it dosen't stay true to the timeout I set
[11:42:04] <Connor_> See here: http://jsfiddle.net/VSQ4j/
[11:42:08] <Connor_> Check out console log
[11:47:39] <jedimind_> is there an html5boilerplate channel?
[11:49:02] <kinga> Connor_,  i was have a similar issue with setTimeout
[11:49:07] <kinga> i had a similar*
[11:49:10] <Connor_> Oh?
[11:49:17] <kinga> it just wouldn't set a timeout
[11:49:23] <kinga> it was really wierd
[11:49:27] <kinga> weird*
[11:50:39] <AaronCampbell> There seem to be a TON of content rotators out there.  I want something that can do this: http://demo.studiopress.com/delicious/ - I know that one is using jFlow+ (http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jflow-plus) but it seems like it hasn't been touched in over a year.
[11:50:46] <realpap> http://jsfiddle.net/dn4Pp/18/ i want to apply a dropdown animation, chould it be done without touching the html&css ?
[11:50:55] <AaronCampbell> Is there a better option out there?  Or should I just use that and assume I'll need to keep it up?
[11:51:31] <realpap> because someone said me the css hover will interfere
[11:51:38] <avigmati> whats my code http://jsfiddle.net/tXQX2/  If call .dialog at first time everything ok: alert 1, but if close dialog & call again alert 1 two times and again 3 times...
[11:52:27] <webguynow> Can I use a selector and val() to set values of a JSON object  ?
[11:53:06] <mytoz> webguynow: what's wrong with object.foo = "bar";
[11:53:11] <avigmati> i try ajaxSetup({cache: false}) but still wrong
[11:54:33] <interlocutor> anyone know of a plugin that will automatically take a ~100 row table and make it into a multi page sortable table that only displays X amount of rows?
[11:55:10] <Connor_> No but that is definatly something I would like to tackle if there isn't one out there! :o
[11:55:25] <gnarf> "grid"
[11:55:35] <tomasm-> hi, how come when I check on a checkbox, j('#checkbox').attr('checked') doesnt show up? but when I do j('#checkbox').attr('checked','checked'), then it does work?
[11:55:45] <pachet> webguynow: that would be awesome, but no
[11:55:54] <gnarf> tomasm-: .attr('checked') is a getter, but what version of jQuery are you using?
[11:56:23] <interlocutor> Are you guys responding to me or someone else?
[11:56:30] <kborchers> interlocutor: data tables (probably overkill), tablesorter ... google is your friend ;)
[11:56:34] <gnarf> tomasm-: if you're using 1.6+ you should use ?prop
[11:56:35] <bot-t> tomasm-, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[11:56:37] <tomasm-> gnarf, 1.6 ....
[11:56:43] <gnarf> .prop( "checked", true )
[11:56:58] <gnarf> interlocutor: jqgrid has paging too i think
[11:57:03] * muzone is now playing: http://soundcloud.com/user4438122
[11:57:07] <avigmati> interlocutor jquery flexgrid
[11:57:09] <interlocutor> Well I've seen those, but from what I can tell they don't automatically do pagination of large tables?
[11:57:15] <interlocutor> I guess I'll look them over again
[11:57:22] <Connor_> @gnarf, could you take a look at an issue I am experiencing?
[11:57:45] <interlocutor> I mean I've seen datatables and tablesorter, I'll check out the others
[11:57:50] <gnarf> Connor_: maybe? why don't you describe the issue for everyone anyway? :)
[11:57:55] <Connor_> http://jsfiddle.net/VSQ4j/
[11:57:55] <interlocutor> Thanks!
[11:57:57] <StanAccy> Can I tie a Datepicker to popup to an arbitrary element - eg. a <div> or an <img> ?
[11:58:09] <Connor_> setTimeout isn't keeping the interval I specify :/
[11:58:12] <Connor_> Only inside a $.each
[11:58:38] <gnarf> Connor_: cuz you're calling it
[11:58:46] <gnarf> Connor_: setTimeout( testTime, delay )
[11:58:57] <jedimind_> StanAccy, why wouldnt you be able to ?
[11:58:59] <gnarf> Connor_: also, .each() passes index as first param to function
[11:59:03] <K1ng`> can anyone tell me which dropdown menu is like www.fantasyislandvacations.com
[11:59:10] <tomasm-> gnarf, why is it different? almost seems like attr() has it's own state registry that it looks into that doesnt consider what the user clicks on
[11:59:15] <K1ng`> dropdown plugin
[11:59:23] <gnarf> Connor_: http://jsfiddle.net/VSQ4j/1/
[11:59:35] <StanAccy> jedimind_: When I attach it to a <span>, the calendar appears inline on the page - Im trying to get it to popup onClick
[11:59:38] <gnarf> tomasm-: .attr() reads the DOM attribute, which doesn't change
[11:59:46] <Connor_> :o
[11:59:47] <Connor_> That is
[11:59:50] <gnarf> .prop() reads/sets the DOM Property, which is what you want to do
[11:59:52] <Connor_> Good :P
[11:59:59] <Connor_> Why does it work without the () exactlly?
[12:00:15] <tomasm-> gnarf, you mean only the original dom state when the page loads?
[12:00:35] <gnarf> tomasm-: it reads the "attribute" from the dom element, which is forever set to the "initial
[12:00:36] <gnarf> yes
[12:00:42] <troubleman> muzone: nice music
[12:01:12] <muzone> thanks man

[12:05:09] <amon293> http://jsfiddle.net/NHgNp/
[12:06:09] <RobW> amon293: link up javascript resources in sidebar
[12:06:14] <RobW> then try again in jsfiddle and send us link
[12:06:47] <amon293> which resources?

[12:12:58] <oojacoboo> hey guys, how can I do something like… if (this.user.whatever = null) {}
[12:13:22] <realpap> http://jsfiddle.net/dn4Pp/18/ i want to add some somple animation to the dropdowns, chould it be done without touching the html&css ?
[12:13:38] <mytoz> oojacoboo: this.user.whatever = this.user.whatever || {}
[12:13:39] <gnarf> oojacoboo: you can... but it would be setting whatever to null and then failing the if
[12:14:08] <troubleman> muzone: at http://soundcloud.com/user4438122
[12:14:41] <troubleman> troubleman: can i buy these tracks somehow?
[12:14:55] <troubleman> * muzone
[12:15:42] <muzone> no
[12:15:52] <muzone> but if you check the user that came before me, http://soundcloud.com/user4438121, his stuff you can buy
[12:16:19] <oojacoboo> gnarf: what about using length()
[12:16:21] <troubleman> ah, i see
[12:16:22] <troubleman> ok cool
[12:16:41] <gnarf> oojacoboo: you can't use a function call as the Left-Hand of a single equals
[12:16:51] <gnarf> do you perhaps mean to test for equality instead of assign?
[12:17:02] <oojacoboo> no, I need assignment
[12:17:11] <oojacoboo> the variable will be null or some value
[12:17:25] <oojacoboo> and I need an if conditional statement on that
[12:17:27] <gnarf> oojacoboo: well after you run that if - it will be null
[12:17:30] <swiggy> how can i use ajax and bookmarking to load a <div> with content, but the content that is loaded - i want it to "focus" on the bookmark?? i tried using .get('/url#bookmark'); but it still just loads the content normally and doesnt go to my bookmark
[12:17:35] <gnarf> cuz you used a single equals
[12:17:44] <mytoz> gnarf: I think my answer is what oojacoboo is seeking
[12:17:53] <gnarf> ?js var a = 10; if ( a = null ) {}; console.log( a );
[12:17:54] <bot-t> gnarf: null
[12:17:57] <swiggy> my <div> is scrollable, and the content that is loaded (via ajax) is sometimes out of focus
[12:17:57] <oojacoboo> mytoz: I didn't quite understand it
[12:18:07] <oojacoboo> why the ||
[12:18:16] <mytoz> oojacoboo: "or" returns the object that is "truthy"
[12:18:19] <gnarf> oojacoboo: do you mean to set a default object?
[12:18:21] <mytoz> instead of a true/false
[12:18:28] <gnarf> mytoz: mis-stated
[12:18:44] <mytoz> meh
[12:19:01] <gnarf> mytoz: null || false
[12:19:04] <gnarf> neither is truthy
[12:19:31] <oojacoboo> gnarf: I don't wish to set anything, only valiate
[12:19:35] <oojacoboo> validate*
[12:19:38] <gnarf> oojacoboo: then use ==
[12:19:48] <gnarf> oojacoboo: that tests equality
[12:19:51] <oojacoboo> mmm yea
[12:19:58] <gnarf> ?101
[12:19:58] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[12:20:02] <oojacoboo> ha
[12:20:04] <oojacoboo> yea, I know
[12:20:20] <gnarf> apparently, you don't
[12:20:21] <gnarf> read it
[12:20:23] <b1lly1> lets say i want to grab the FORM data (object) and .stringify it, is this possible?
[12:20:24] <gnarf> its good stuff
[12:20:24] <oojacoboo> yea, but I do
[12:20:32] <oojacoboo> I just slipped on that
[12:20:43] <b1lly1> i created an event to listen for the .submit
[12:20:58] <swiggy> anyone able to help with my Q?
[12:20:59] <b1lly1> but i want to return false, and send an ajax request with the stringified object
[12:21:08] <gnarf> ?ajaxForm @bittyx-laptop
[12:21:08] <bot-t> bittyx-laptop, ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/form
[12:21:09] <gnarf> oops
[12:21:14] <gnarf> b1lly1: ^^^
[12:21:16] <gnarf> sorry bittyx-laptop
[12:21:32] <gnarf> ?g jQuery ajaxForm
[12:21:33] <bot-t> gnarf, jQuery Form Plugin - http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[12:21:51] <avigmati> b1lly1 JSON.stringify(data);
[12:22:18] <solars> hey, what went wrong if I create a custom theme online, download it, place the css/custom-theme/ css file to my app, include, and get a normal list instead tabs?
[12:22:29] <gnarf> b1lly1: with ajaxForm - all you need to do is $(form).ajaxForm(); and it will hook the bind/convert to json/etc
[12:22:42] <gnarf> if you just want the submission portion
[12:22:46] <gnarf> .ajaxSubmit()
[12:22:53] <gnarf> and you can bind your own handles
[12:25:37] <b1lly1> so is it .submit(function(data) {     JSON.stringify(data) });      ?
[12:26:04] <avigmati> yeah json2.js
[12:26:08] <avigmati> do this
[12:27:36] <Connor_> Is it possible to call a self-invoking function manually?
[12:28:36] <tomasm-> Connor_, you mean via trigger() ?
[12:29:04] <Connor_> I mean I create a named self-invoking function eg. (function workingArea() { // some code })()
[12:29:16] <Connor_> I want to then call workingArea() again at some point in my code
[12:29:53] <tomasm-> Connor_, assign the function to a variable.... var funcName = function workingArea() { ... }
[12:31:17] <Connor_> Clever. Thanks :D
[12:32:08] <tomasm-> Connor_, you can also assign it to an object property, ie var obj = { func1: function workingArea() { }, ... }
[12:32:35] <tomasm-> hmmm i think it'd be "function()" w/o a name at that point
[12:33:02] <Connor_> Yeah, useful to know :)
[12:33:08] <iroxoru> hi jquery

[12:37:25] <Connor_> I imagine it's because selfInvokingFunction is not actually a function reference, it's a variable reference that reference's a function >.<
[12:38:31] <Gangans> the js is something like that - http://pastebin.com/ybBqCa4r
[12:38:59] <aple> sphinxxxx: I suggest making your own.
[12:39:02] <Connor_> @Eviltwin, tomasm see above for the issue im having ^

[12:48:17] <haxin> Is it possible to hide the URL that's displayed when someone hovers over a link?  I've tried a few different methods but they don't seem to work.
[12:48:47] <aple> haxin: I don't think you can mask the default behavior of an anchor
[12:48:59] <aple> haxin: Seems that has to do with the browser and is beyond manipulation
[12:49:30] <Raverix> well, since you're in a jQuery channel, I'm going to assume you're ok with using jQuery...
[12:49:30] <aple> haxin: You could create a <span class="faux_link"> tag and wrap your link in that
[12:49:56] <aple> haxin: Then you could do a .click event on .faux_link
[12:50:10] <aple> haxin: This would mask the URL from the browser
[12:50:25] <aple> Raverix: Are you talking to me? Getting to your question now :P
[12:50:29] <Raverix> So you can do something like... $('a').each(function(){ $(this).data('href', $(this).attr('href', '#')).attr('href', '#'); })
[12:50:47] <Raverix> I typed that quickly, so it'll have typos.
[12:50:54] <haxin> aple: not familiar with that so I'll check.  I've succeeded in doing this with javascript (shows 'javascript:void(0)' on hover) but was looking for a different method
[12:51:07] <Raverix> But basically, store the href of the url in data, remove the href, then use window.location to perform the action yourself.
[12:51:32] <aple> Figured out my problem. Tabs need to be ID's, not classes.
[12:52:20] <Raverix> aple: Yeah, were you not responding to my question?
[12:52:41] <Connor_> How can I call a function on dom ready and then after x amount of seconds without doing. myFunction(); setInterval(myFunction, x);
[12:52:42] <Connor_> ?
[12:53:13] <Raverix> Connor_ That WOULD be how you would do it.
[12:53:20] <Raverix> Connor: What's your issue with that method?
[12:53:32] <aple> Raverix: Working on it. Please be patient.
[12:53:40] <Connor_> Just seems a waste to type pretty much the same thing twice in a row.
[12:53:45] <Connor_> Wondering if there was another method
[12:54:08] <Raverix> Well, you could do.... function callNowAndThen(fn, delay) { fn(); setInterval(fn, delay);  }
[12:54:15] <Raverix> There, now you can do callNowAndThen(myFunction, x);
[12:54:40] <b1lly1> with the .submit
[12:54:44] <aple> Ok, what are you trying to do exactly Raverix
[12:54:45] <aple> ?
[12:54:47] <b1lly1> si there a way to return all the data in an object?
[12:54:52] <b1lly1> for the form
[12:55:05] <aple> Raverix: It's wrapping all the <li> directly within ul.transform
[12:55:13] <aple> (like you're telling it to do)
[12:55:20] <aple> What are you trying to wrap with that <span>?
[12:55:46] <aple> You're trying to wrap the text within the first <li> with <span> right?
[12:56:03] <Raverix> Original markup, <ul><li>Test</li><ul><li>No Wrap</li></ul></li></ul>, Desired markup: <ul><li><span>Test</span<</li><ul><li>No Wrap</li></ul></li></ul>, achieved markup <ul><li><span<Test</li><ul><li>No Wrap</li></ul></span<</li></ul>
[12:56:14] <Raverix> Note the position of the closing span in what I want, and what I'm getting.
[12:56:15] <aple> Oh, I see.
[12:56:17] <Raverix> It's wrapping the UL as well.
[12:56:23] <aple> You're trying to wrap "Building One"
[12:56:27] <Raverix> Yes.
[12:56:42] <aple> Hm. Why are you doing this?
[12:57:06] <Raverix> I need to put some extra CSS styles on the <span> and I need the markup to hook into.
[12:57:16] <Raverix> Also putting some javascript handlers.
[12:57:32] <aple> Why not add styles like: .transform li { color:red; } .transform li li { color:blue; } ?
[12:57:34] <Raverix> I'm trying to make the markup very easy to input (for a CMS editor).
[12:58:00] <Raverix> Aple: I need to put a background image at the end of the text.
[12:58:39] <aple> At the end of the "Building One" text?
[12:58:45] <Raverix> Yes.
[13:00:17] <webroasters> hi guys. I'm trying to put something into the value of an input box that has the class "helloworld": for example = <input type="text" value="" name="somename" class="helloworld">
[13:00:38] <Raverix> $('.helloworld').val('Hi!');
[13:00:50] <webroasters> that's what i thought, ok, thx
[13:01:05] <Raverix> Well, if that's what you thought, why didn't you just try it?
[13:01:11] <aple> Raverix: http://jsfiddle.net/Qc99U/1/
[13:01:39] <Raverix> aple: The background image is all the way to the right.
[13:01:40] <webroasters> i thought I had, but I must have not done it right
[13:01:49] <Raverix> Needs to be be inline and show up right after the text.
[13:01:53] <aple> Raverix: You need it immediately after text?
[13:01:54] <aple> k
[13:02:04] <drudog> Anyone know if it's possible to fire off a jquery script depending on max-width. Like a media query but for jquery? I don't want a certain script of mine running on mobile browsers.
[13:04:42] <Raverix> http://jsfiddle.net/Qc99U/4/
[13:04:45] <Raverix> Got it.
[13:04:53] <Raverix> I remove the <ul>, wrap the text, put the UL back.
[13:05:19] <Raverix> drulog $(window).height(), $(window).width();
[13:05:22] <Raverix> Use those to make tests.
[13:05:39] <drudog> Ahhh ok.
[13:05:50] <Raverix> I personally use a server side script which makes a best guess to see if you're using a browser, and then send appropiate content.
[13:06:39] <aple> Raverix: Crap. Can't figure out how to grab just the text without it grabbing the html as well.
[13:06:54] <aple> Raverix: I thought .text would work to grab just the text, but it's storing the HTML as well. :(
[13:06:55] <K1ng`> someone please help me fix dropdown on http://www.goroatan.com/index.html
[13:06:59] <drudog> Yeah, basically I just want this script to avoid all screens less than 768px
[13:07:04] <Raverix> aple: Yeah, tried that too.
[13:07:11] <Raverix> aple: Looks like I've gotta do it in multiple steps.
[13:07:20] <Raverix> Oh well, I've got a working solution and that'll get me to my deadline.
[13:07:26] <Raverix> aple: Thank you for your jelp.
[13:09:14] <sphinxxxx> anyone here used mobosurvey ?
[13:09:54] <aple> Raverix: np, wish I could help more. Seems like it's something where you could save everything in .transform > li, then use regex to find where the .transform > ul starts and get the opposite
[13:09:58] <aple> Ok, off to work
[13:12:10] <codabrink> Hello, I was wondering how you create an array of DOM elements in jQuery.
[13:13:04] <Eviltwin> codabrink: Can you explain further?
[13:14:11] <codabrink> I know that a jquery selector like $('.front') grabs all of the elements of class 'front' into a list, but how do you manually build that list?
[13:14:31] <codabrink> build a list*
[13:14:52] <Eviltwin> codabrink: Are you trying to not use jQuery?
[13:14:58] <Eviltwin> Make your own jQuery?
[13:16:18] <webroasters> I'm somewhat of a noob with JS in general, but this is the way to do a function, correct? Ex. function something() {  code here  }
[13:16:26] <codabrink> No.. I just want a list of specific elements.. like var list = ['#item1', '#item2', '#item3'], but that doesn't seem to work so well when I use the $.each iterator.
[13:16:30] <Gangans> hi again
[13:16:35] <Gangans> I have code like this http://jsfiddle.net/VQkUH/12/
[13:16:49] <Eviltwin> webroasters: Yes
[13:17:05] <Gangans> can someone help me to get that those images fading out and then fading in after hover on links?
[13:17:05] <Eviltwin> codabrink: $("#item1, #item2, #item3")
[13:17:07] <kborchers> codabrink: $("#item1, #item2, #item3");
[13:17:13] <Eviltwin> I win!
[13:17:16] <kborchers> heh
[13:17:18] <webroasters> so why do I keep getting "function name is not defined" in this case, calc()
[13:17:26] <codabrink> Thanks, that is what I was looking for. :)
[13:17:37] <Eviltwin> codabrink: You mean a list of selectors, not a list of DOM elements
[13:17:49] <codabrink> oh, okay
[13:17:52] <Eviltwin> DOM elements are the actual elements themselves
[13:18:02] <Eviltwin> #item1 is a way of referencing a particular DOM element
[13:18:15] <Eviltwin> But there are infinitely may ways to reference and element including the object itself
[13:18:15] <codabrink> Yeah, that does make sense.. thank you
[13:19:11] <Gangans> anyone?
[13:19:30] <Eviltwin> webroasters: Can you put your example in a jsFiddle
[13:19:51] <webroasters> yep, 1 sec
[13:20:03] <Eviltwin> Gangans: Cross-fading or what?
[13:20:17] <Gangans> no, no
[13:20:46] <Eviltwin> So what happens if I quickly jump from one link to another?
[13:20:49] <Eviltwin> Does it queue?
[13:22:41] <Gangans> i want to that images don't simply changes... I to get that images fades in when you get mouse on other button (link)
[13:22:45] <webroasters> @Eviltwin: http://pastebin.com/n1yd6ZZb
[13:22:53] <Gangans> sorry about my bad english
[13:22:54] <webroasters> sorry, I like pastebin better
[13:23:06] <rgr> If anyone with experience of jquery-ui could suggest my a certain li selector doesnt work I would be greatful. A normal div selector around a text area works fine but resizeable on the li doesnt show the resize anchor.
[13:23:09] <Ojje> Hi there. Got problems with ajax jsonp. Got "invalid label " error. Anyone know what i should do?
[13:23:49] <Gangans> and thanks for answer Eviltwin.
[13:24:41] <Ojje> In the Net-tab in Firebug i got {"Name":"An item"}... but i cant make it work with success function. :(
[13:25:35] <ngharo> jsonp expects a function with the json data as its argument
[13:25:54] <JonathanCutrell_> Hey folks...
[13:26:05] <Eviltwin> webroasters: And what's the error you're getting?
[13:26:19] <Eviltwin> Oh
[13:26:19] <JonathanCutrell_> I'm looking for the progressive animation of the jquery github repo commits… any idea where I can find it?
[13:26:31] <Eviltwin> webroasters: Drop the jQuery(document).ready(function() { ... }) wrapper
[13:26:37] <Eviltwin> There's no need for it here
[13:26:39] <webroasters> ok 1 sec
[13:26:40] <JonathanCutrell_> it was on yayquery a long time ago
[13:26:43] <JonathanCutrell_> I don't remember the name of it
[13:26:45] <JonathanCutrell_> or who created it.
[13:27:11] <JonathanCutrell_> ah!
[13:27:13] <JonathanCutrell_> Gource.
[13:27:36] <kborchers> Gangans: this should get you close to what you want http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/VQkUH/31/
[13:27:46] <webroasters> @Eviltwin: the error went away now, however, it's not multiplying the unit times the unit price now
[13:28:30] <webroasters> it wasn't before hand either, by the way
[13:29:03] <webroasters> oh hold on
[13:30:23] <JesperA> .unload(), where are you? Or is it possible to unload something that you have .load(), like a toggle event, clicking on a link activate the toggle for .load() and ".unload()"?
[13:30:43] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to do on unload?
[13:31:18] <JesperA> i have a productlist, i want to expand an item with .load, and the minimize it again by unloading it
[13:31:33] <JesperA> the = then
[13:32:06] <Eviltwin> JesperA: Try .html("") instead
[13:33:06] <JesperA> yeah well, can .html load an element on another page?
[13:33:16] <Eviltwin> What?
[13:33:30] <Gangans> wow, it seems working... Thanks kborchers
[13:33:43] <kborchers> :)
[13:34:38] <jedimind_> Eviltwin, why would you suggest .html as a replacement for .load ?
[13:34:44] <jedimind_> they're apples and oranges
[13:35:15] <Eviltwin> jedimind_: To "unload" the contents element
[13:35:21] <Eviltwin> contents of an element*
[13:35:27] <jedimind_> .remove() ?
[13:36:00] <Eviltwin> .empty()
[13:36:08] <Eviltwin> .remove() is different
[13:36:57] <JesperA> well, i guess i can do it the simple way, just .hide when pressing the toggle link again
[13:39:27] <oojacoboo> how can I call a variable outside of jquery but only after the document is ready?
[13:39:40] <Ojje> ngharo: success: function(data)   Like that?
[13:40:16] <oojacoboo> $(document).ready(function() {}); is an anonymous function right?
[13:40:20] <ngharo> Ojje: create a fiddle please.  see: ?p
[13:40:31] <ngharo> ?p
[13:40:32] <oojacoboo> so you can only access the variables within jQuery and that function
[13:40:32] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:43:22] <Ojje> ngharo: http://fixee.org/paste/0c2lbk0/
[13:45:37] <codabrink> I'm trying to iterate through selectors, and it doesn't seem to be doing anything. This is what I'm doing to iterate: $('#merchant_street_address', '#merchant_city').each(function(i,value){ alert(); });
[13:45:49] <codabrink> Any suggestions?
[13:46:25] <imsky> $("#merchant_street_address, #merchant_city")
[13:46:40] <reaby> how i can get true json of htmlElement ? var elemdata = JSON.stringify($(this)[0]); --> returns only jquery+id combination!
[13:51:25] <boogerman> I have this JQ function that I need to run on a div that will be loaded via ajax, I've got it to work in FF but not IE8 or IE6. http://pastebin.com/ha1PBC8e
[13:51:25] <ccmonsters> reaby, got a demo?
[13:51:56] <codabrink> Does anyone know how to iterate over a list of selectors?
[13:52:12] <ccmonsters> use the full $.ajax methods boogerman
[13:52:17] <jedimind_> $('.selector1, .selector2').each() ?
[13:52:19] <ccmonsters> a list of selectors? like what ?
[13:52:30] <ccmonsters> what jedimind_ said, unless you mean something else
[13:52:42] <jedimind_> and if you mean something else, i'm still right.
[13:52:47] <kborchers> codabrink: imsky already told you what was wrong with your code
[13:52:54] <codabrink> $('#item1', '#item2').each() seems like it does nothing, but is that the proper way to do it?
[13:52:56] <ccmonsters> haha, you certainly aren't wrong.
[13:53:22] <jedimind_> codabrink, think of it like a css selector, it's all the same thing, dont seperate it with quotes
[13:53:28] <kborchers> codabrink: look closer at your code and the samples that have been provided. they are different
[13:53:30] <jedimind_> $('#item1, #item2').each() instead
[13:53:35] <jedimind_> </spoonfeeding>
[13:53:37] <tomasm-> boogerman, what is that supposed to be doing? i think the 'load' is redundant, because an event will only bind once the object is already loaded
[13:53:40] <ccmonsters> lol jedimind_
[13:53:41] <codabrink> Oh, I see. It's so hard to read this in the web interface. Sorry about repeating the question.
[13:53:49] <ccmonsters> np
[13:54:13] <Obelich> hiyas i want to use .tooltip buth in inputs and on focus not for mouse over anyone no busy can give some help http://pastebin.com/4jEJS3sd

[13:54:38] <jedimind_> im building a jquerymobile-like mobile framework from scratch
[13:54:42] <jedimind_> in like ... 3 days
[13:54:42] <zorph> anyone have a code example for drag'n'drop sorting of menu items..creating 1 level depth parent child relationships?
[13:54:53] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: You're thinking of scope the wrong direction
[13:55:08] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: Only stuff within the anonymous function can access stuff within the anonymous function
[13:55:17] <Eviltwin> But stuff within the anonymous function can access anything outside it
[13:55:26] <zorph> in cms, I need to enable sorting of nav..and dropping on another item...create sub item...
[13:55:41] <ccmonsters> jquery ui zorph
[13:56:01] <oojacoboo> this.variable Eviltwin would refer to the anonymous function, how would you call that from within it if this is outside that function?
[13:56:16] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: Make a jsFiddle example of what you're trying to do
[13:56:20] <zorph> yes I know...I've used sortable before...but not parent/child sortable..
[13:56:32] <zorph> it's not clear how to accomplish it in the jqueryui docs
[13:56:40] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: I've already scrapped this idea, just more for knowing now
[13:57:03] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: Well until I'm actually clear on what you want to do, there's no way for me to help you
[13:57:20] <oojacoboo> this.variable refers to a variable within the function?
[13:57:27] <ccmonsters> zorph, got a demo, or example?
[13:57:32] <oojacoboo> /this being the key word
[13:57:32] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: Not exactly
[13:57:41] <Eviltwin> this is a very special reserved word
[13:57:51] <zorph> nope
[13:57:59] <boogerman> i don't know much about jquery... Anyhow, the popup div is loaded inside of a .net item repeater, inside a user control. So I've used this jquery to run a popover. However in IE8 it loads with errors on the page, and the script will not run
[13:58:07] <oojacoboo> yea, any links then on that Eviltwin
[13:58:19] <K1ng`> can anyone help me with cufon yui?
[13:58:28] <oojacoboo> I don't think I fully understand, I thought this.whatever set that up as a variable for the function
[13:58:45] <ccmonsters> $(this)
[13:58:46] <boogerman> I just need code to run on the click of a div that will not be there when the page is loaded
[13:58:56] <boogerman> i guess
[13:59:01] <kborchers> ?live @ boogerman

[13:59:12] <ccmonsters> boogerman, .live('click',function(e){//code here})
[13:59:32] <ccmonsters> read what kborchers just had the bot send you
[13:59:57] <boogerman> the .live will give me an error when the page loads
[14:00:05] <boogerman> object not found
[14:00:19] <reaby> ccmonsters: well most likely the problem is, that i can't get json version out of the htmlElement, so i could pass it as text.. maybe alternative way is just to grab all the id's and classes and text, put them into object and pass that in json then recreate the html from that :)
[14:00:20] <boogerman> $('.popupDetails').live("click", function() {
[14:00:41] <kborchers> boogerman: did you try it?
[14:00:50] <Obelich> anyone ?
[14:01:04] <boogerman> Yes, this was my original code, but it fails in IE8.
[14:01:10] <boogerman> works great in FF
[14:01:25] <boogerman> I have this in the doc load. Is that a problem?
[14:01:55] <ccmonsters> you need a demo, you might just be implementing it wrong.
[14:02:05] <ccmonsters> boogerman, get a demo and someone can try to help you through it
[14:02:43] <ccmonsters> reaby, i dont totally know what your situation is. Get a demo, or something that better shows your situation and then someone can better help you
[14:02:57] <boogerman> hrm
[14:03:08] <ccmonsters> when in doubt, demo

[14:07:17] <oojacoboo> thanks man :)
[14:07:19] <boogerman> Take $(document).ready(function() {$('.popupDetails').live("click", function() { When the page is loaded, in IE8, I get object not found. The object isn't there on the laod of the page. If I can figure out how to set that I think that fixes my problem. Is that any claerer. I really don't feel like setting up a demo today.
[14:08:05] <ccmonsters> i didnt look into it too much. and i wont if it's not focused.
[14:08:16] <ccmonsters> gotta keep your questions as focused as possible if you want prompt help.
[14:08:42] <ccmonsters> None of us want to sift through stuff. We all are probably working and trying to be productive and are taking time out of our day to help out as possible
[14:10:00] <becom33> umm I'm trying this http://terminal.jcubic.pl/examples.php and in the json-rpc-service-demo.php I added a new function called lol . the problem is . it returns the hash value of the login http://pastebin.com/qJtEz8m3 .

[14:14:03] <wizbit> is it possible to change content of a div using js ?
[14:15:09] <jedimind_> ... yes wizbit but you're better off in #javascript
[14:16:36] <wizbit> there is no jquery way of doing it?
[14:16:40] <jedimind_> so, anyone want to chime in on mustache vs jq.tmpl() ?
[14:17:00] <Eviltwin> wizbit: Change from what to what?
[14:17:00] <JonathanCutrell_> jedimind_: probably a potato potato thing. (That does't make sense typed out...)
[14:17:24] <wizbit> Eviltwin: i want the contents of a div to change when somebody clicks a link, so the whole page doesnt update
[14:17:37] <Eviltwin> wizbit: Notice: "to what"
[14:17:47] <wizbit> new products
[14:17:55] <Eviltwin> Where are you getting that information from?
[14:18:00] <JonathanCutrell_> wizbit: try load?

[14:18:38] <JonathanCutrell_> wizbit: one sec

[14:42:37] <slash_nick> Having a problem with JQuery UI drag-and-drop... can I post a link to a gist to try and get some feedback?
[14:48:06] <streblo> i have a function that takes an encoded html string and turns it into a decoded html string that i can render in the page, but its not working quite like i want it to. can someone help me debug this? http://dpaste.com/621565/
[14:48:28] <streblo> if the string is encoded html, it works fine, but if its decoded html, it strips the tags
[14:48:39] <streblo> i want any string, encoded or decoded, to come out decoded
[14:48:57] <amon293> hey! i want to use 2 google charts in my website but i'm having trouble to make them both work. can anyone please help me? thanks! http://jsfiddle.net/NHgNp/2/
[14:49:45] <_zoggy_> can anyone improve this, want to make it generate a random color based off any length string input. (think of it like how ColorfulTabs works) -- http://jsfiddle.net/K4QxQ/
[14:50:53] <slash_nick> I am using jQuery UI to manage a group of tickets... draggable/droppable works fine the first time I move an object, but once it's been dropped it can't be drag/dropped into another container without page reload.  https://gist.github.com/1243467
[14:51:19] <_zoggy_> Basically, I want to create a function that will accept any old string (will usually be a single word) and from that somehow generate a hexadecimal value between #000000 and #FFFFFF, so I can use it as a colour for a HTML element.
[14:51:36] <jedimind_> lol
[14:51:41] <jedimind_> that "somehow" is a big thing
[14:51:41] <b1lly1> lets say i have an object like  var obj = { 'blah' : 'blah' };
[14:51:45] <b1lly1> how do i add onto it?
[14:51:50] <b1lly1> like append to it
[14:52:09] <b1lly1> so that it turns into var obj = { 'blah' : 'blah', 'blah2' : 'blah2' }
[14:52:10] <jedimind_> look up .extend
[14:52:41] <jedimind_> b1lly1, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[14:53:37] <jaequery> is it possible to perform file downloads over ajax request?
[14:53:40] <context> anyone know what would be wrong with this: http://screencast.com/t/0M2S2mJ4N2U
[14:54:01] <context> jaequery: file downloads will not change the current location of the page
[14:54:09] <context> why try doing it over ajax ?
[14:54:27] <jaequery> because i dont want users to refresh the page
[14:54:40] <context> and using ajax is going to prevent them from refreshing ?
[14:54:46] <b1lly1> so obj = { 'blah' : 'blah };           newobj = { 'blah2' : ' blah2' };             obj = $.extend(obj,newobj); ?
[14:55:02] <jedimind_> yupp
[14:55:20] <jaequery> yeah that is the idea
[14:56:37] <context> jaequery: from my knowledge you cant 'download' as a file through ajax.
[14:56:57] <context> and considering no one else does it, id guess its not possible period
[14:59:39] <b1lly1> anyone see a problem with this ? http://pastie.org/2596586 on line 7
[14:59:52] <b1lly1> basically loops through the form and im trying to create an object
[14:59:58] <b1lly1> with all the field names and values
[15:01:19] <context> b1lly1: $(form).serialize() ?
[15:02:14] <context> or serializeArray()
[15:04:04] <context> so no help on my issue? :(
[15:04:11] <context> code works in console, not event handler
[15:08:36] <Whirl3d> good evening channel. Can you use multiple selectors with .hasClass?
[15:09:01] <Whirl3d> like $("tr").hasClass("blank, error, new")?
[15:10:23] <Whirl3d> anybody?
[15:10:42] <bonks> I want to show a dialog onclick of a link or button, the content should fetched only onclick. How can I do this with maybe json or displaying another page?
[15:10:48] <Jayflux> Whirl3d use .is if you're checking multiple classes
[15:11:39] <context> whirl3d: try it?
[15:11:51] <Whirl3d> Jayflux, thanks.
[15:11:59] <Jayflux> $(this).is('.foo, .bar')
[15:12:01] <Jayflux> yw
[15:12:20] <Whirl3d> context, too difficult to focus and set up test cases when generous folks like JayFlux are here to help.
[15:12:38] <context> whirl3d: actually its not difficult to open up a console and use pre-existing html
[15:12:54] <ricklerre> Hey,  do you guys know if QUnit has release versions?  or is the version on master in Git always considered stable?
[15:13:10] <context> ricklerre: click 'tags'
[15:13:35] <context> oh it has none :x
[15:13:40] <context> ricklerre: or check search.npmjs.org
[15:15:34] <amon293> hey! i want to use 2 google charts in my website but i'm having trouble to make them both work. can anyone please help me? thanks! http://jsfiddle.net/NHgNp/2/
[15:16:10] <ricklerre> context: that doesn't appear to have normal qunit, just a port of it.
[15:18:18] <context> ricklerre: github.com/jquery/qunit holds the package.json for node
[15:19:18] <context> oh, it is puleed from a different repo :/
[15:21:53] <ricklerre> context: so basically, there aren't release versions?  just the latest?
[15:23:01] <context> i guess
[15:23:16] <ricklerre> okay, thanks
[15:26:26] <Mage_Dude> If I'm inside of a droppable and perform an ajax request, in the success: portion of the ajax call, what refers to the droppable element? Doesn't the 'this' keyword refer to the ajax request?
[15:35:57] <chrisbuchholz> Hey guys
[15:36:37] <chrisbuchholz> Is there a great plugin for detection browsers in jquery? $.browser doesnt properly detect e.g. chrome. I need something more specifik.
[15:37:33] <chrisbuchholz> min nye arch og gnome t-shirts kom med posten idag
[15:37:34] <chrisbuchholz> yaj!
[15:37:42] <chrisbuchholz> woops, wrong channel
[15:46:21] <amon293> is there any jquery code or function that alows image enlargement without plugins?
[15:47:52] <danheberden> so you want some javascript that utilizes jquery, but isn't in the form of a plugin?
[15:48:40] <amon293> sorry i made myself misunderstood
[15:48:59] <amon293> does jquery have some function that allows image enlargment?
[15:50:06] <Topcat>  amon293  You've have to animate the size and the position at the same time
[15:50:20] <Topcat> or do it in css
[15:50:31] <amon293> how i do it on css?
[15:50:47] <danheberden> ?g webkit-transform scale
[15:50:48] <bot-t> danheberden, Fun with CSS Transforms in Firefox and Webkit - zachstronaut - http://www.zachstronaut.com/posts/2009/02/17/animate-css-transforms-firefox-webkit.html
[15:50:49] <Topcat> use the new animate stuff but it won't work for everyone
[15:50:53] <amon293> i want to click and enlarge an image
[15:51:07] <Topcat> like a lightbox?
[15:51:23] <Topcat> or just a little enlargen effect ?
[15:53:00] <amon293> like a lightbox
[15:53:30] <amon293> i've to download http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/
[15:53:31] <amon293> right?
[15:57:06] <amon293> Topcat: like a lightbox
[15:57:38] <Topcat> yeah, or something similar
[15:57:49] <amon293> so
[15:58:01] <amon293> i must download the lightbox plugin
[15:58:08] <amon293> and try to make it work
[15:58:10] <amon293> ok
[16:02:19] <richardr> When I bind an event to keypress, and say lookout for a particular key. Where can I see the key list map for the keyboard? E.g. Want to detect Windows key in jQuery
[16:02:51] <richardr> Each key is mapped to an integer? 13, 14, 15. Where can I find a list that maps these to the keyboard?
[16:03:27] <kanzie> Is http://www.wait-till-i.com/2007/08/22/again-with-the-module-pattern-reveal-something-to-the-world/ the best way to go about the module-pattern or is there more development into best practices?
[16:06:24] <amon293> Topcat: do you know how this lightbox works?
[16:06:46] <Topcat>  amon293  Not really I don't like them very much
[16:07:00] <amon293> what lightbox do you recomend?
[16:07:03] <Fraxtil> I'm very new to jQuery. I've found that I can do `timestamp = $("<span>").html("2011-09-26"); $("#post").append(timestamp.html())` to insert a timestamp into #post, but this omits the <span> tag. Appending just `timestamp` gives me [object Object]. How do I append the whole <span> to #post, not just its html?
[16:09:29] <njbair> isn't there a jquery method that basically just selects the element?
[16:10:38] <krater> Someone here use clueTip plugin?
[16:15:18] <jaequery> how can I get current time in datetime format ?  2011-09-21 11:31:11
[16:19:57] <webdev5> lets say I have a variable dest, which points to an element, and I want to show the html.  Do I reference it like so: $dest.html();  ?
[16:20:12] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/sqZVD/  pofavor
[16:20:19] <oojacoboo> por favor :P
[16:23:23] <webdev5> still there jaequery?
[16:23:56] <jaequery> yes
[16:24:05] <jaequery> and i am still waiting =D
[16:24:07] <webdev5> you need a separate plugin to format dates
[16:24:35] <jaequery> ugh not another plugin!
[16:25:08] <Kamakazi> there is always another plugin
[16:26:48] <webdev5> oojacoboo, what are you trying to do?  Assign a listener to success?
[16:27:38] <oojacoboo> webdev5: yes basically
[16:27:42] <oojacoboo> but I don't have access to that code
[16:27:48] <oojacoboo> I can only add my own <script>
[16:28:21] <webdev5> hmm
[16:29:45] <webdev5> have you tried bind?
[16:31:47] <oojacoboo> webdev5: no, I don't know much about bind
[16:31:49] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/sqZVD/2/
[16:31:53] <oojacoboo> that's the script that I have
[16:31:59] <oojacoboo> but I don't have access to that
[16:32:08] <oojacoboo> I just need to listen on completion of that function
[16:33:23] <Eviltwin> Okay, you see the Widget.asyncInsertion?
[16:33:28] <Eviltwin> That's ripping that function out of that object
[16:33:35] <Eviltwin> Which means "this" no longer refers to Widget when it's run
[16:34:02] <Eviltwin> The easiest way to solve that is to do function(){Widget.asyncInsertion()} instead
[16:34:15] <Eviltwin> You create an anonymous function so the function call keeps that context
[16:35:42] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: I don't have access to that script
[16:36:32] <Eviltwin> What?
[16:36:54] <oojacoboo> this is a script thats used on the site, I can only add new <script>s
[16:37:12] <Eviltwin> There's no clean way to listen on that AJAX
[16:37:22] <Eviltwin> Without initiating the AJAX
[16:37:28] <danheberden> sounds like an xss if you aren't able to control the scripts on a page
[16:37:29] <Eviltwin> There are lots of horrible, horrible ways to do it
[16:37:32] <oojacoboo> ok, what's what I figured
[16:37:35] <Eviltwin> But I don't recommend any of them
[16:37:47] <oojacoboo> danheberden: don't assume
[16:37:56] <danheberden> i didn't
[16:38:00] <danheberden> sounds like !== assume
[16:38:00] <Eviltwin> Why can you only add new scripts?
[16:38:08] <oojacoboo> zendesk.com
[16:38:10] <oojacoboo> hosted
[16:38:23] <Eviltwin> And you are trying to?
[16:38:42] <oojacoboo> I just want to show hide these damn widgets based on my criteria ;)
[16:39:00] <Eviltwin> Is it just for you?
[16:39:01] <Paul_Linney> oojacoboo: have you looked at http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/ ?
[16:39:21] <newtang> Hi, I filed a bug which, interestingly, doesn't manifest itself in jsFiddle, but is otherwise reproducible.  The bug was closed because I was told that if it's not happening in jsFiddle it's not a bug. How can I ask the bug triage team to take a closer look?
[16:39:38] <Eviltwin> newtang: What's the bug?
[16:39:45] <newtang> 10183
[16:39:46] <oojacoboo> Paul_Linney: negative, this looks interesting
[16:40:33] <Eviltwin> newtang: Just link me
[16:40:33] <coldhead> newtang: just provide a link to somewhere else where the bug does appear
[16:40:47] <coldhead> it's probably a doctype thing
[16:40:51] <newtang> Eviltwin http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10183
[16:41:11] <Eviltwin> That...is not loading for me
[16:41:11] <newtang> coldhead, I have a code snippet in the bug.  It's pretty short.
[16:42:04] <newtang> Weird
[16:42:06] <oojacoboo> Paul_Linney: this would require that I call the ajax function, right?
[16:42:52] <coldhead> live demo or bust, newtang
[16:43:04] <coldhead> put it on geocities or something ferchrissake
[16:43:04] <Paul_Linney> oojacoboo: yip and on completion you can then call your own function
[16:43:22] <newtang> coldhead, ok I can push it somewhere.  1 sec
[16:43:34] <oojacoboo> yea, but I can't call this ajax function, so this won't help :(
[16:43:50] <Eviltwin> newtang: When an element's not visible, it doesn't really have a height
[16:44:23] <newtang> Eviltwin, I get 52 for height.  I figure it should be 0 or correct.  Not a strange number
[16:44:55] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: Bad solution: var realAjax=$.ajax;$.ajax=function(settings){if(ilikethe(settings)){realAjax.apply($,arguments)}}
[16:46:27] <danheberden> Eviltwin oojacoboo check out prefilters
[16:47:31] <oojacoboo> danheberden: I can't call the ajax function
[16:48:00] <newtang> coldhead, http://jonnew.com/jquery/jqueryDisplayNoneHeight.html   In the log, I expect the height of #d2 to be 0 or the same as #d1
[16:48:27] <danheberden> oojacoboo that's why i was suggesting a prefilter
[16:48:30] <danheberden> so you could intercept
[16:48:37] <danheberden> you have the jqxhr object
[16:48:39] <danheberden> like - forever
[16:48:43] <danheberden> even post request
[16:48:52] <danheberden> wrap that in a deferred, and you'er golded
[16:48:54] <danheberden> *golden
[16:49:09] <danheberden> like this http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2123-Using-Deferred-Objects-In-jQuery-1-5-To-Normalize-API-Responses.htm
[16:49:31] <newtang> eviltwin, I think jquery tries to momentarily set the node to visible, then get the height, then rehide it.  But in the process, it's getting an erroneous value
[16:49:42] <oojacoboo> danheberden: reading
[16:51:17] <smoak> is there a way to tell when a particular event was added to jquery?
[16:51:29] <smoak> oh nevermind i fail at reading
[16:56:17] <newtang> Any other thoughts Eviltwin, coldhead?
[16:58:17] <Eviltwin> newtang: Its happening because of the position: absolute property
[16:59:54] <Eviltwin> If you set that property manually, it happens too
[17:00:25] <newtang> Eviltwin, It's setting #d2 to position:absolute?  Interesting
[17:01:19] <newtang> Any idea why it doesn't manifest itself in jsFiddle?  I thought it might be the Doctype, but I think I"m matching JSFiddle's doctype
[17:05:39] <Eviltwin> newtang: I know exactly what it's happening
[17:05:43] <Eviltwin> They have a CSS reset and you don't
[17:05:51] <Eviltwin> http://fiddle.jshell.net/css/normalize.css
[17:05:55] <newtang> aha!
[17:05:57] <newtang> Nice find!
[17:06:03] <Eviltwin> Probably the div { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
[17:06:31] <newtang> Oh, that makes sense
[17:07:12] <newtang> So, when jquery sets position to absolute, it should probably also adjust padding/margin
[17:07:29] <Eviltwin> Well technicalyl the padding/margin are part of the element
[17:08:26] <Eviltwin> It's the margin on the <p> tag that's causing the oddity
[17:08:39] <Eviltwin> p { margin: 0; } fixes it
[17:10:21] <newtang> What purpose does the position:absolute serve?
[17:10:57] <Eviltwin> Not causing all your shit to shift when it makes the swap
[17:11:14] <Eviltwin> Otherwise it might flash occupy that space for an instant
[17:11:23] <newtang> I see, got it
[17:11:44] <Eviltwin> If you set just position:absolute on the element, you get this: http://cl.ly/2t2L2n1O1s2z2j1M1Z1J
[17:11:53] <Eviltwin> Compared to the other one: http://cl.ly/2r0V3u1d3K3N3A0R1O2L
[17:12:42] <newtang> But why does the P have the margin when it's within an absolutely positioned div?
[17:13:32] <Eviltwin> User agent stylesheets are sucky and built for HTML4 days, that's why people use CSS resets
[17:17:04] <newtang> Eviltwin, I appreciate the help.  I'm confused about one thing: I wouldn't think the styles of a p would be affected if its parent container was absolutely positioned or not.  Regrdless of a user agent stylesheet
[17:17:31] <Eviltwin> Well it's definitely the browser causing the problem, not jQuery
[17:17:42] <Eviltwin> Something you might want to report as a WebKit bug
[17:18:34] <newtang> Hmm, it happens in Firefox too
[17:18:56] <Eviltwin> I think I know what's going on, maybe
[17:19:36] <Eviltwin> p tags have p { display: block; -webkit-margin-before: 1em; -webkit-margin-after: 1em; -webkit-margin-start: 0px; -webkit-margin-end: 0px; } in the user agent stylesheet for WebKit
[17:19:56] <Eviltwin> In a normal text environment, this margin is effectively ignored
[17:20:05] <Eviltwin> But if you have p tags one after another
[17:20:21] <Eviltwin> The margins collapse and you have a line between the two
[17:21:02] <Eviltwin> If you have this: <div id="d1"><p id="p1">blah!</p></div><div id="d2" style="position: absolute"><p id="p2">blah!</p></div>
[17:21:13] <Eviltwin> And you inspect the two, you'll see the p's are the same size with the same padding
[17:21:18] <Eviltwin> Same margin*
[17:21:28] <Eviltwin> But the margin is *outside* the first div and *inside* the second
[17:21:34] <Eviltwin> It even pushed the second down to below the first
[17:22:03] <Eviltwin> Kind of reminds me of some of the UL/LI behavior
[17:24:14] <newtang> Interesting
[17:27:22] <coldhead> thanks for catching that, Eviltwin
[17:27:39] <coldhead> newtang: if you can be bothered you should update your ticket to explain what was happening
[17:27:45] <coldhead> lest it bite someone else
[17:29:34] <newtang> Eviltwin, Even though there's a div wrapping each p,one of the -webkit-margin styles kicks in anyways?
[17:29:37] <tregeagle> I can append a css file, but how do I de-append it?
[17:29:46] <newtang> coldhead, I should be able to do that
[17:30:48] <Eviltwin> coldhead: No problem, had some time
[17:30:53] <Eviltwin> Before I realized I have a problem set due tomorrow
[17:31:31] <coldhead> good luck with that then!
[17:31:36] <Eviltwin> Hah, thanks
[17:31:38] <coldhead> what subject?
[17:33:32] <Eviltwin> Theory of Computation
[17:33:37] <rgr> tregeagle: why would you want to de-append?
[17:33:52] <Eviltwin> (Computer Science)
[17:34:29] <newtang> Eviltwin, do you mind if I add snippets of our conversation to the bug?
[17:34:55] <Eviltwin> Nope, go right ahead if you want
[17:35:28] <tregeagle> I'm not sure, it just seems messy to keep expanding the list of appended css
[17:41:15] <dvschramm> I'm using jquery mobile, and I'm trying to make the lists selectable with no arrow button.
[17:41:20] <dvschramm> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-inset.html like this but no arrow
[17:41:24] <boopaloop> i'm developing a plugin using $.cssHooks(). is it good practice to clean up after myself and nullify the hooks when i'm done? if so, where is the best place in my plugin?

[17:47:21] <dvschramm> found out: data-icon="false"
[17:56:21] <Eaven> i have a dynamically generated list of text fields that i want to grab all the values of and add them up. since they're dynamic i cant add a custom id so i'm trying to use a data-total-selector
[17:56:34] <Eaven> but i cant seem to get the selector to hit on the .blur();
[17:57:38] <Eaven> $('input[data-total-selector]').blur();
[17:57:38] <John-Gresham> hi
[17:57:39] <Eaven> right??
[17:57:54] <Eaven> oh
[17:57:54] <Eaven> blah
[17:57:58] <Eaven> since they are a collection
[17:58:08] <Eaven> i have to iterate through them
[17:58:17] <John-Gresham> I'm having troubles trying to use the .change event on a input type="text", can someone help me ?
[17:58:38] <John-Gresham> I doesn't trigger when the value is change but when the element is blurred
[17:59:02] <coldhead> yeah that's how it works, John-Gresham
[17:59:08] <coldhead> that's when it's deemed to have changed
[17:59:19] <coldhead> rather than "in the process of being changed"
[17:59:36] <coldhead> you might like to try keypress()
[17:59:37] <John-Gresham> aaaah, it means a change in the state of the element
[17:59:43] <coldhead> yes
[18:00:00] <John-Gresham> I was looking for an event triggered when the value is changed :/
[18:00:10] <coldhead> you can often get away with $('input').bind('change keypress', function ...)
[18:00:14] <coldhead> and bind to both
[18:01:17] <John-Gresham> arf, ok, thanks coldhead
[18:03:51] <Eaven> how can i grab a collection of inputs by data key/value attribute??
[18:03:58] <Eaven> $(":customdata(total-selector)").each(); isnt working
[18:04:07] <Eaven> oh hm
[18:04:24] <Forbidd3n> Is there any way with datePicker on the next and previous arrows to make it advance 12 months instead of 1 month?
[18:04:31] <Eaven> i replaced customdata with data still the same error
[18:04:35] <coldhead> i think you would have to use filter, Eaven
[18:04:39] <coldhead> ?filter
[18:04:39] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[18:05:03] <coldhead> and give it a custom function that returns true or false if they belong in your set
[18:06:03] <Eaven> i'd like to do it on .blur though ;x
[18:06:34] <Eaven> the thing is i can only set a data attribute to use as the selector
[18:06:39] <Eaven> which i cant seem to get jquery to select
[18:06:43] <Forbidd3n> Did my question make sense?
[18:06:59] <coldhead> data stuff is fancy/complicated/a special case, Eaven
[18:07:04] <coldhead> i don't see why you can't use filter
[18:07:12] <coldhead> yes Forbidd3n
[18:07:22] <coldhead> i just can't help because i don't know datepicker
[18:07:25] <coldhead> sorry
[18:08:29] <rmacd> Having a bit of a usability issue - wonder if anyone might be able to give me a quick hand - currently (http://bit.ly/qZRiwb) I've row upon row of radio buttons which people are supposed to click, scale 1-7. But I really, really loathe radio buttons. Been playing a bit with jQuery (to make the whole <td>/<span> active, not just the button), but might anyone suggest a more elegant solution?
[18:08:51] <Eaven> i looked at the filter i'm just not sure how to implement it thats all
[18:09:26] <Eaven> here is what i'm trying to do... i have an orders page with line items and a price per line item... after the user sets a price in the line item price field id like to grab all the price fields values and add them up and plop them in the total
[18:09:48] <Eaven> since i'm using rails and cocoon to dynamically generate the inputs i cant grab them by their id
[18:10:10] <Eaven> and so far all of my attempts to grab the collection by data attribute or whatever has failed miserably
[18:11:44] <Eaven> http://pastie.org/2597225
[18:12:10] <Eaven> I know... thats terrible and will not work
[18:12:11] <Eaven> but blah
[18:12:16] <Forbidd3n> coldhead: I figured it out, thanks though.
[18:13:15] <Eaven> jquery isnt my thing... im a ruby ninja
[18:13:17] <Eaven> just meh on the jQ
[18:13:33] <coldhead> Eaven: is the data attribute changed dynamically?
[18:13:40] <Eaven> nope
[18:13:41] <coldhead> or will it be fixed when the page loads?
[18:13:50] <Eaven> fixed everytime i hit add new item
[18:13:58] <Eaven> it'll always be data-total-selector=true
[18:14:08] <Eaven> and i'd just like to grab the collection each time one is blurred
[18:14:10] <Eaven> and add the values up
[18:14:33] <Eaven> if i can just get it to hit on the blur im sure i could get the collection of them and go from there
[18:14:36] <Eaven> but i just cant get the blur to hit
[18:18:27] <coldhead> Eaven: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/483053/
[18:18:32] <coldhead> one of those might work
[18:18:46] <coldhead> lol bugs
[18:21:51] <Eaven> 0 for 3 ;x
[18:21:58] <kanzie> Im using $.ajax() to load data using GET. I define the response dataType as xml but the response headers says text/html, this make the error:-clause kick in with failed with response: TypeError: Cannot read property 'documentElement' of null. How can I fix this?
[18:22:48] <Eaven> coldhead: http://chompbyte.com:3000
[18:22:59] <Eaven> click on the +
[18:23:03] <Eaven> see the donation field
[18:23:16] <Eaven> id like to grab the values of each donation field on any of their blurs
[18:23:17] <John-Gresham> coldhead: found a solution : bind on keydown and keyup and see if there's a difference between the two values of the element
[18:23:18] <coldhead> oops there was a bug in my data argument: http://paste.pocoo.org/compare/483054/483053/
[18:23:26] <coldhead> hahaha good job John-Gresham
[18:24:02] <Eaven> and total them into the total
[18:24:03] <Eaven> nope
[18:24:09] <Eaven> even with the removal of data-
[18:24:11] <Eaven> still nothing
[18:24:16] <coldhead> Eaven: http://jsfiddle.net/PYE42/
[18:24:21] <coldhead> that works for me
[18:24:52] <coldhead> what am i missing?
[18:24:57] <Eaven> hmm
[18:24:59] <Eaven> maybe its me
[18:25:00] <Eaven> hang on
[18:25:00] <Eaven> ;D
[18:26:47] <Eaven> hmm... maybe because they are being created dynamically after the page is loaded
[18:26:54] <Eaven> but i still dont see why jq wouldnt see it
[18:27:06] <coldhead> you told me it was fixed! :P
[18:27:37] <Eaven> no i said maybe it was me breaking it
[18:27:37] <Eaven> lol
[18:29:01] <coldhead> Eaven: http://jsfiddle.net/PYE42/1/
[18:29:09] <coldhead> that should work with dynamically added inputs
[18:29:19] <coldhead> it checks the data live
[18:31:22] <Eaven> WOOT
[18:31:25] <Eaven> ty!!
[18:31:25] <Eaven> ;D
[18:31:29] <Eaven> coldhead: you are the man!
[18:31:36] <coldhead> you're welcome babe
[18:31:42] <coldhead> good luck :)
[18:32:15] <Eaven> onward and forward
[18:32:19] <Eaven> atleast this roadblock wasnt too long
[18:45:29] <Eaven> hey coldhead you around still??
[18:45:45] <top> does anyone know if the google maps plugin works fine with the jquery mobile?
[18:46:05] <Eaven> how could i grab a collection of those $('input).data('total-selector')
[18:47:33] <coldhead> var totals = []; $('input').each(function () { totals.push($(this).data('total-selector')); });
[18:50:13] <coldhead> Eaven: http://jsfiddle.net/pLxmC/ slightly more rubyish
[18:53:03] <kborchers> top: Ive
[18:53:06] <kborchers> Oops
[18:53:29] <kborchers> I've used this one http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-map/
[18:53:44] <Eaven> coldhead: im not trying to get the values of the data attribute ;x more the values of the input field
[18:53:45] <Eaven> here's what i have
[18:53:48] <Eaven> and its working
[18:53:49] <Eaven> http://pastie.org/2597338
[18:53:57] <Eaven> but i'm getting an extra 0 in the beginning of my total
[18:53:59] <Eaven> so instead of 10.0
[18:54:02] <Eaven> its 010.0
[18:54:10] <Eaven> since its adding the base 0.0 to 10.0
[18:54:17] <Eaven> but i'm not sure how to get rid of the beginning 0
[18:54:22] <Eaven> i'd like to keep the decimal
[18:54:26] <Eaven> but not the beginning 0
[18:54:45] <coldhead> ?mdc parsefloat
[18:54:46] <bot-t> coldhead, parseFloat - MDN - Parses a string argument and returns a floating point number. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat
[18:55:08] <snover> any data you get from the dom is a string, not a number, except for when you use $.fn.data, because it does stupid tricks.
[18:55:18] <snover> don’t rely on those tricks.

[19:16:16] <jimubao> lol
[19:16:20] <jimubao> or mootool
[19:16:29] <rgr> What tool would you recommend for pop up hover help/tooltips?
[19:16:40] <gf3> flash
[19:16:47] <jimubao> XD
[19:16:52] <abjorn> gf3, troll facin all over the place
[19:17:08] <jimubao> coda have a very decent pop jquery
[19:17:10] <Cephlin> i thought he was trollin :p
[19:17:20] <snover> gf3 would never do that
[19:17:38] <Cephlin> Is that so
[19:17:45] <snover> yes
[19:18:00] <bobby77> I am trying to user jquery templates but I keep getting this error... "jQuery is not defined" any thoughts?
[19:18:05] <gf3> AHEM
[19:18:14] <jimubao> rgr: http://jqueryfordesigners.com/coda-popup-bubbles/
[19:18:21] <snover> gee bobby77 I dunno, maybe jQuery is not defined?!
[19:18:26] <rgr> just looking
[19:18:36] <bobby77> but it is as I am using it all over my site
[19:18:43] <Cephlin> bobby have you imported the jquery script file?
[19:18:48] <bobby77> yea
[19:19:11] <Cephlin> How are you calling the function?
[19:19:24] <bobby77> the jquery works fine without the template, but with it it doesnt
[19:19:44] <bobby77> $('#videoResult').tmpl(videos).appendTo('#video_search_results');
[19:20:58] <Cephlin> Put the jquery script import just before that liine and see what happens
[19:23:07] <Cephlin> How did that go bobby?
[19:23:29] <bobby77> ok I did it still didn't work. The only thing I am doing different than I usually do with jquery is that I am not importing the script in the head tag. I have it towards the bottom beacuse I'm using boilerplate
[19:23:54] <Cephlin> That's what it means by jquery is not defined
[19:24:00] <bobby77> but it is still imported bedore the jquey functions
[19:24:18] <Cephlin> Well it can't be
[19:24:42] <bobby77> well why would HTML5 boilerplate import jquery at the bottom then?
[19:24:56] <bobby77> it said its supposed to be faster
[19:25:00] <Cephlin> I'm not saying it can't be done
[19:25:11] <Cephlin> I'm saying it just isn't working working correctly
[19:25:29] <Cephlin> Have you tried importing it in the header and see if that works?
[19:25:29] <bobby77> ill try moving it in the head tag and see what happens
[19:25:52] <Cephlin> cool
[19:27:45] <Hannspree> who wants to see me and my girlfriends get wet and strip?
[19:28:06] <bobby77> yea it worked by putting it in the head tag, but it also works by moving the import jquer.tmpl.js to the bottom as well so I did it that way
[19:28:53] <Cephlin> Nice
[19:29:21] <Cephlin> In the template they only import js/libs/modernizr-2.0.6.min.js
[19:29:29] <Cephlin> in the header
[19:30:37] <Cephlin> Is boilerplate the best around?
[19:31:08] <Cephlin> for cross platform
[19:32:04] <coldhead> yes
[19:34:01] <bobby77> probably
[19:34:33] <abjorn> well don't treat it like it's some magical thingy, it's just a starting point
[19:37:07] <Cephlin> I'll give it a go
[19:44:55] <m_smith> anyone in here
[19:44:55] <rhizmoe> so, i hope this is enough detail, but i am experiencing difficulties using: $.getJSON("http://localhost/foo.json"); as assigned to var foo = $.getJSON(...) // am i doing it wrong?
[19:45:07] <rhizmoe> hah
[19:45:13] <m_smith> ha
[19:45:28] <m_smith> well rhizmoe, I can't help
[19:45:35] <rhizmoe> no problem
[19:45:49] <m_smith> i'm using mousenter/mouseleave and can
[19:46:23] <context> ok. does ui-autocomplete just suck or does it just not want to work for me
[19:46:27] <m_smith> and can't figure out how to stop a new event from being seen while the current animation is taking place
[19:46:30] <context> how can i programatically change the selected item
[19:47:10] <context> search does not work
[19:50:56] <rhizmoe> context: use the net pane
[19:51:02] <rhizmoe> see if requests are happening
[19:51:58] <context> no this is a combobox to make matters worse
[19:52:15] <context> i need to update the select AND the input field
[19:52:28] <context> all  i want is a text input with text AND a different value
[19:57:23] <rgr> this should be correct for a jq button on a reset button? $("input:reset").button();
[19:58:17] <subsume> Googleapis hosts jquery which is nice, but IE hates it due to Same Origin Access policy
[19:58:33] <subsume> How do people use the handy google remote hosted and yet use IE?
[20:02:07] <rhizmoe> oh, just serve it directly already
[20:03:39] <ionico> if im newbie in JS, what book do you recomend me before star with jquery ???
[20:03:57] <coldhead> ?g jqfundamentals @ ionico
[20:03:58] <bot-t> ionico, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[20:05:07] <danzik17> ionico: JavaScript:  The Good Parts ( Doug Crockford )
[20:05:48] <context> subsume: the real question is... 'how do people use ie?'
[20:08:47] <context> all iwant is datalist support damnit :(
[20:16:47] <bung> hey im running an ajax call to a php page that is just echoing output, so i dont think there are the right headers and so im not getting a good response data back. is there another way to grab the output on the page? do i need to be using some particular contentType or dataType ?
[20:16:56] <bung> I cant change the PHP script
[20:17:10] <bung> i cant get good google results for ajax non-encoded text response
[20:17:30] <bung> anyhelp is much appreciated :)
[20:18:07] <opra_1> How do I get the text of a cell in a table (td) - keep in mind the rows of the table were generated with an ajax call
[20:18:40] <opra_1> I would like to use this
[20:19:05] <opra_1> my mouse is hovering over the cell
[20:20:35] <coldhead> $('td').live('mouseover', function () { var urtext = $(this).text(); });
[20:22:17] <opra_1> Thank you coldhead
[20:23:17] <zach23> Is there a plugin (or through jquery perhaps) that will allow me to load more data into a select (multiple) the more they scroll down - there's about 25,000 entries that have to show up - I was thinking allow them to scroll down 200 for example
[20:23:20] <ionico> thanks danzik17 , one question, The Good Parts ( Doug Crockford ) book  is it for newbies ?
[20:24:30] <danzik17> ionico: Yes and no.  It's not a "Hello World" kind of book, but it will help you still clear of some of bad parts of javascript that "newbie" books may not point out.  Best to begin with good habits imo.
[20:25:20] <danzik17> ionico: (For ref, I started JS roughly 6 months ago.  That was one of the first things I read.)
[20:26:17] <coldhead> js the good parts is very dry and bitter
[20:26:26] <coldhead> it's not a fun read
[20:26:36] <coldhead> and it doesn't want anything to do with the DOM
[20:26:58] <coldhead> it's not especially great for getting work done
[20:27:42] <coldhead> but it will help you write what crockford considers technically correct JS
[20:28:13] <chjj> why would you want to do that?
[20:28:49] <chjj> ;)
[20:28:53] <coldhead> because you haven't got much else in your life i guess
[20:39:01] <courpse> How can i get data-tab from $('.class').click() ?
[20:40:16] <coldhead> var tab = $(this).data('tab');
[20:41:17] <courpse> Is data okay to use now? i was told in here to use attr('data-tab').
[20:41:27] <courpse> Else i'd of used data as you say.
[20:42:19] <coldhead> i'd have* used data
[20:42:31] <courpse> Ta.
[20:42:42] <courpse> You get harrased by someone else for the same thing, ;/
[20:42:43] <coldhead> if there is reason not to use data it will soon be apparent
[20:42:45] <courpse> I keep forgetting.
[20:43:07] <courpse> Well, i was only told not too because it wasn't very safe on all browsers.
[20:43:11] <coldhead> but data is gnerally recommend for "data"
[20:43:14] <coldhead> no that's BS
[20:43:21] <courpse> Aight, coo coo.
[20:43:22] <coldhead> jQuery makes it okay
[20:43:23] <courpse> Thanks.
[20:43:34] <coldhead> there's just some edge cases with type conversion
[20:43:42] <coldhead> or if you use data AND attr shit goes crazy
[20:44:29] <courpse> Ahh right, kk.
[21:00:53] <rgr> I am trying to show some html in a jquery tooltip but its just not appearing and is being rendered as html instead despite me calling htmlentities(field).
[21:12:25] <PoPSiCLe> hey
[21:12:31] <PoPSiCLe> got a quick regexp-question
[21:13:02] <PoPSiCLe> I have a variable which contains a string, something similar to this: ./ucp.php?pblakl_sldkfjaf_ksadjflkj (only the first part is relevant)
[21:14:05] <PoPSiCLe> I want to replace the beggining of the string, the ./-part, with something else, but I can't get this to work: captchaData (the variable) - captchaData.replace(/(\.\/)/,"replace_with_this")
[21:14:32] <PoPSiCLe> it doesn't do anything, which leads me to believe that my regexp is wrong (ie, it doesn't find it)
[21:14:44] <brianarn> PoPSiCLe: Are you just calling replace and not saving the result? It won't modify the string in-place
[21:14:55] <brianarn> captchaData = captchaData.replace(...)
[21:14:58] <PoPSiCLe> oh
[21:15:20] <PoPSiCLe> I thought it would manipulate the variable  and save it as the replaced variable
[21:16:07] <brianarn> As the variable is a primitive string and not an object, it's effectively immutable. replace will create a new string that you then save somewhere else.
[21:16:14] <PoPSiCLe> duh...
[21:16:24] <PoPSiCLe> I feel stupid :D
[21:16:25] <brianarn> Easy mistake to make tho :)
[21:16:26] <PoPSiCLe> but thanks
[21:18:00] <Dr4g> Cufon is great, but it's removing font-styles such as bold, and line-through (strike)
[21:18:02] <Dr4g> :-(
[21:18:11] <Dr4g> I'm switing to @font-face in CSS now
[21:19:02] <PoPSiCLe> cufon is too buggy - while font-face is pretty workable, IMHO
[21:32:33] <sk8ball> i'm calling a PageMethod using jQuery's .ajax and am having problems passing the two data parameters to the function
[21:32:34] <sk8ball> http://www.pastie.org/2597861
[21:32:45] <sk8ball> anyone feel like taking a look?
[21:32:52] <richardr> Anyone used the "zipper" technique of representing data structures in JS ?
[21:33:18] <sk8ball> the stack trace in firebug shows a System.ArgumentException
[21:33:28] <sk8ball> but im not sure why
[21:34:03] <sk8ball> i think it has to do with the way the data: option of the .ajax call is formed
[21:34:09] <sk8ball> but i cant figure it out for the life of me
[21:34:38] <sk8ball> someone? anyone?
[21:35:14] <brianarn> sk8ball: your calls to .text should be .text()
[21:43:29] <Bower^^> Has anyone here managed to mimic google's search functionality but querying some web API instead of local data? I'm trying but failing, mainly with the aborting of old XHR requests.
[21:45:46] <coldhead> Bower^^: have you tried the UI autocomplete plugin?
[21:45:51] <coldhead> with a remote src?
[21:46:00] <coldhead> because that works terribly well
[21:46:09] <coldhead> otherwise consider an ajax queue plugin
[21:46:15] <coldhead> what will kill old shit for you
[21:46:18] <coldhead> upon request
[21:46:27] <Bower^^> coldhead, I haven't but I certainly will. This is driving me mad
[21:46:30] <Bower^^> something so simple
[21:46:51] <coldhead> simple things can still be difficult to do well
[21:46:55] <coldhead> look at archery
[21:46:59] <coldhead> or the tea ceremony
[21:47:10] <coldhead> or scoring LSD in a city rife with crime :(
[21:47:28] <Bower^^> I do have code that aborts old queries but it seems the reply still comes back. .abort() makes the callback null or something so I get jquery errors
[21:47:34] <Bower^^> "blah is not a function"
[21:47:39] <coldhead> gross
[21:47:49] <coldhead> you must be aborting them wrong
[21:47:56] <coldhead> but i can't remember the right way off the top of my head
[21:48:08] <Bower^^> Well I have a list of xhr objects
[21:48:28] <Bower^^> before adding the new one, I iterate through it and call .abort on each element
[21:48:34] <Bower^^> how else can you do it?
[21:48:42] <Eviltwin> Bower^^: .abort() fires the error callback
[21:48:55] <Bower^^> i know
[21:49:07] <Bower^^> it does actually work
[21:49:13] <Bower^^> if you type stuff in slowly
[21:49:22] <Bower^^> otherwise it generates the jquery errors
[21:49:27] <coldhead> maybe see how autocomplete handles it?
[21:49:29] <Eviltwin> Are you starting the XHR immediately?
[21:49:36] <Eviltwin> With each key press
[21:49:51] <Bower^^> i've got a debounce so only one ever second
[21:50:06] <Bower^^> I've actually deleted the code as it raged me so
[21:50:10] <Bower^^> i'll rewrite it and upload
[21:50:20] <Bower^^> so what you guys think if you've got a spare moment
[21:50:28] <Bower^^> see*
[21:50:53] <Bower^^> coldhead, it's nice to have that as a back-up but I would like to get this working. It's only a pet project so hoping to learn some new shizzle
[21:52:31] <coldhead> yeah sure
[21:52:46] <coldhead> you can learn some new shizzle by reading their source :)
[21:56:43] <Bower^^> hehe fair point coldhead
[21:57:54] <Bower^^> coldhead and Eviltwin, http://pastebin.com/ntVE5Gsn
[21:58:12] <JohnRobert> is it possible to do $("form").change()?
[21:58:20] <JohnRobert> eg if anything about a form changes..
[21:58:40] <coldhead> JohnRobert: $('form :input').change() will work
[21:58:52] <JohnRobert> cool thanks
[22:00:22] <Bower^^> works great if you type like my Nan
[22:00:26] <Bower^^> but jQuery errors otherwise
[22:00:51] <coldhead> hhahaha
[22:01:09] <coldhead> alert("This service works best if an elderly person types for you")
[22:01:11] <coldhead> ?cc
[22:01:11] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[22:01:19] <Bower^^> haha
[22:02:24] <Eviltwin> Bower^^: I suggest something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/PPNBW/1/
[22:03:15] <Bower^^> I did initially think of something like that
[22:03:48] <Eviltwin> Bower^^: I think that will make things A LOT easier to keep track of
[22:05:31] <Bower^^> However on a really bad connection, like mine at the moment, the user could still have replies coming back in a non-sequential order
[22:05:53] <Bower^^> I need something like this basically say "ignore everything that comes back from those XHRs except the most recent"
[22:06:44] <Bower^^> And I can't really see why typing it relatively fast causes the errors
[22:08:57] <Cork> Bower^^: how autocomplete normally solve that is by using a delay
[22:09:10] <Bower^^> I see
[22:09:11] <Cork> to only send if the user haven't typed anything in the last x ms
[22:09:19] <Bower^^> so basically what eviltwin said
[22:09:23] <coldhead> bless you, Cork
[22:10:11] <Cork> Bower^^: its a lot frendlier twards the network too
[22:10:38] <Cork> sending and aborting 10/100 of connections isn't performing well on tcp networks
[22:10:52] <Eviltwin> Bower^^: http://jsfiddle.net/pP2Zn/1/
[22:10:52] <Bower^^> yeah fair point
[22:11:11] <Bower^^> really appreciate the advice guys, definitely learnt something
[22:11:17] <binaryfus10nz> if I want to this only run once, how do I run die(); ? 	$('.projects').live('mouseover', function() { $(this).find('a').prepend('<span></span>') });
[22:11:30] <Chibby_> can anyone please tell me if there's some way to select all descendants of $(this), i may be wrong, but i can't seem to find anyway using a the standard way you do it with selectors?
[22:11:33] <Bower^^> nice thanks again Eviltwin
[22:11:41] <Cork> ?.one @ Chibby_
[22:11:42] <bot-t> Chibby_, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[22:12:33] <Chibby_> that was meant to be @ binaryfus10nz methinks
[22:12:39] <Cork> Chibby_: if you want something like "add it once at most for each element, no matter when its added"
[22:12:52] <Cork> you need something like setting a flag on the element with .data
[22:12:54] <Cork> and check for that
[22:13:08] <Cork> Chibby_: true, sorry :P
[22:13:19] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: ^

[22:13:42] <Cork> Chibby_: $(this).find('*') ?
[22:14:05] <Chibby_> cool, thank you
[22:14:20] <Cork> Eviltwin: thats way slower then it needs to be
[22:14:39] <Cork> adding loads of event listners and then removing them takes time
[22:14:51] <Cork> and each still won't listen for future elements
[22:14:59] <Eviltwin> Oh, true, live
[22:15:01] <binaryfus10nz> brilliant tnx Cork
[22:15:08] <Eviltwin> Is .one?
[22:15:10] <binaryfus10nz> any other ones?
[22:15:37] <Cork> Eviltwin: .one does the same as bind, so no not future elements
[22:15:50] <binaryfus10nz> what if I want the even to be pageload
[22:15:53] <binaryfus10nz> or mouseenter
[22:16:20] <binaryfus10nz> well guess that is same as over but what is like the default .. mainly if content loaded with ajax... then u want to modify it
[22:16:50] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: lets back up a bit
[22:17:08] <Cork> you can do it multible ways, depending on what you really want to do
[22:17:32] <binaryfus10nz> well I guess for now thats all I really needed
[22:17:59] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: just cause you add something through ajax, doesn't mean you have to use live :)
[22:18:07] <Cork> but ya, if your satisfied
[22:18:49] <binaryfus10nz> of course... only if prepending like in my example
[22:19:12] <Cork> no only if it adds many many times
[22:19:24] <Cork> prepend or append or what ever isn't really a problem
[22:19:38] <binaryfus10nz> hmm actually well now I have an issue
[22:19:40] <Cork> only the number of times and how much its spread out over time
[22:20:17] <binaryfus10nz> is there a way to reset the one?
[22:20:23] <Cork> sure
[22:20:40] <Cork> just select the element and unbind it see ?.unbind
[22:20:40] <bot-t> .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[22:24:14] <cypha> can I access the time after a Submit button has been pressed, but before things have been submitted to the server?
[22:24:27] <cypha> because i'm trying to prevent a file of an incorrect extension to be uploaded
[22:24:49] <Cork> cypha: that would be the submit event
[22:24:57] <cypha> http://pastebin.com/QGs8xEc9
[22:24:59] <Cork> ?.submit @ cypha
[22:24:59] <bot-t> cypha, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[22:25:04] <cypha> this code doesn't seem to be stopping it
[22:25:30] <Cork> cypha: you can't saved
[22:25:33] <cypha> it gives an error, but doesn't actually stop the file from being uploaded
[22:25:36] <Cork> *haven't
[22:25:50] <Bower^^> Seems to be working great. Thanks again Cork, coldhead and Eviltwin
[22:26:05] <cypha> Cork, what have I not saved?
[22:26:07] <binaryfus10nz> but when you visit just /1 and click work... it doesnt grab the .one
[22:26:24] <Cork> cypha: i get a your pastebin has triggered when i try to load your link
[22:26:51] <cypha> hmm, I just opened it
[22:27:11] <Cork> ah, not it worked
[22:27:19] <cypha> k, round 2--> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/483111/
[22:27:44] <Cork> cypha: is #picture_upload the form or what is it?
[22:27:51] <cypha> yeah
[22:28:05] <Cork> you can't do what your doing
[22:28:15] <Cork> you don't have access to the file name
[22:28:44] <cypha> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/483113/
[22:28:57] <cypha> what do you mean?
[22:29:28] <Cork> cypha: browsers doesn't share the filename if i don't remember wrong
[22:29:39] <cypha> it does
[22:30:02] <cypha> the script works in recognizing the filename
[22:30:14] <cypha> it just doesn't stop it from being uploaded afterwards
[22:30:34] <cypha> how can I stop the upload if the alert() is triggered?
[22:30:41] <Cork> set return false afterwards then
[22:31:22] <Cork> binaryfus10nz: what do you mean doesn't grab the .one?
[22:31:23] <cypha> Cork, http://paste.pocoo.org/show/483114/ ?
[22:31:49] <Cork> cypha: ya
[22:32:24] <cypha> Cork, didn't work
[22:32:28] <cypha> file still uploads
[22:32:48] <Cork> cypha: but you get the alert?
[22:33:04] <cypha> yeah
[22:33:14] <cypha> I always got the alert without an issue
[22:33:18] <Cork> weeerd....
[22:33:28] <Cork> UGG! >_<
[22:33:41] <Cork> ya, right thats weerd... NOT >_<
[22:33:52] <Cork> sigh
[22:33:58] <Cork> i wish i could read
[22:34:05] <Cork> that wasn't it
[22:34:14] <Cork> cypha: ok, lets try this
[22:34:31] <Cork> cypha: set return false the first thing in the function
[22:34:44] <Cork> that sould effectivly kill all submitions
[22:35:03] <Cork> *should
[22:35:05] <cypha> Cork, how so?
[22:35:05] <eddiemonge> cypha: why are you not checking === -1?
[22:35:23] <cypha> eddiemonge, I am
[22:35:28] <Cork> cypha: its just a check to see that the event works as it should
[22:35:32] <cypha> it's an if statement
[22:35:33] <eddiemonge> no, you are checking == -1
[22:35:34] <Cork> cypha: == is not the same as ===
[22:35:45] <cypha> oh, whta's  === ?
[22:35:59] <Cork> type validating
[22:36:07] <cypha> so if I change == to === everything will work?
[22:36:07] <Cork> ?eval "1" == 1
[22:36:08] <bot-t> Cork: true
[22:36:10] <Cork> ?eval "1" === 1
[22:36:11] <bot-t> Cork: false
[22:36:24] <eddiemonge> ?tias @ cypha
[22:36:25] <Cork> cypha: no it has nothing with the problem to do
[22:36:25] <bot-t> cypha, Try It And See
[22:36:53] <cypha> same thing
[22:36:55] <cypha> nothing changed
[22:36:56] <Cork> eddiemonge: we get the alert, so the if statement isn't the problem
[22:37:21] <Cork> cypha: it has minimal importance for this case
[22:37:28] <cypha> k
[22:37:40] <eddiemonge> whats the problem?
[22:37:50] <Cork> eddiemonge: return false doens't stop the submition
[22:37:55] <eddiemonge> ?eval 0 == -1
[22:37:58] <bot-t> eddiemonge: false
[22:38:10] <cypha> this code is giving me an alert as expected when the extension doesn't match, but it still allows the file to be uploaded --> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/483113/
[22:38:14] <Cork> cypha: could you try the return false at the top of the submit event handler?
[22:38:40] <cypha> Cork, can you click "reply" in the paste and show me?
[22:38:49] <cypha> if you don't mind
[22:39:03] <RobertV> anyone know how i might access/modify the text value inside a String object? i'm trying to do something like this: String.prototype.add_text = function(text) { this += text; }
[22:39:14] <Cork> cypha: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/483115/
[22:39:36] <Cork> cypha: with that nothing should be posible to submit
[22:39:47] <Cork> if it is, i'm not sure what happens...
[22:40:16] <Cork> cypha: btw what browser are you using?
[22:40:38] <cypha> Cork, actually your first solution worked!!
[22:40:45] <cypha> it was just that I put a capital F in false
[22:40:52] <Cork> lol
[22:40:56] <Cork> didn't even notice XD
[22:41:04] <cypha> silly me
[22:41:12] <cypha> thank you
[22:41:17] <Cork> np
[22:42:54] <cypha> also, where would I change the look of that alert?
[22:42:57] <cypha> to make it prettier
[22:43:07] <coldhead> CSS
[22:43:40] <coldhead> get the selectors from firebug or web inspector
[22:44:56] <Cork> RobertV: you can't modify the this object from a string
[22:45:07] <Cork> RobertV: but you can return it
[22:45:30] <Cork> ?eval String.prototype.add_text = function(text) { return this + text; }; print("text".add_text(' something') @ RobertV
[22:45:31] <bot-t> RobertV: SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[22:45:37] <Cork> arg...
[22:45:48] <Cork> ?eval String.prototype.add_text = function(text) { return this + text; }; print("text".add_text(' something')) @ RobertV
[22:45:49] <bot-t> RobertV: "text something"
[22:45:49] <eddiemonge> cypha: im confused by your code. first you tell the html to only allow gifs but your js looks for gifs, jpgs and pngs
[22:46:31] <RobertV> yeah, that's what i ended up settling with
[22:46:54] <Cork> RobertV: though why would you need a function for something like that?
[22:47:24] <RobertV> just curious about modifying the object value
[22:48:23] <cypha> K coldhead
[22:48:51] <cypha> eddiemonge, I was gonna remove the html attribute totally
[22:48:55] <cypha> since it doesn't do anything
[22:48:58] <cypha> unless I'm mistaken
[22:49:10] <Cork> it does in browsers that supports it
[22:49:26] <Cork> it limits what file types can be selected
[22:49:36] <Cork> but far from all browsers support it
[22:49:36] <eddiemonge> cypha: it works in chrome
[22:50:03] <cypha> k
[22:50:26] <cypha> so how can I specify multiple filetypes?
[22:50:46] <cypha> accept="image/gif/jpeg/jpg/png" ?
[22:51:03] <Cork> i think its space separated
[22:51:22] <cypha> "image/gif jpeg jpg png"
[22:51:32] <Cork> no
[22:51:36] <Cork> full mimetype
[22:51:43] <Cork> image/gif image/jpeg image/jpg image/png
[22:51:47] <cypha> image/gif image/jpg
[22:51:48] <cypha> k
[22:52:04] <cypha> thank you again
[22:52:18] <cypha> coldhead, firebug doesn't allow the alert to be hilighted
[22:52:29] <Cork> cypha: "A set of comma-separated strings, each of which is a valid MIME type, with no parameters."
[22:52:40] <Cork> so it should be image/gif,image/png ...
[22:52:46] <Cork> http://dev.w3.org/html5/markup/input.file.html#input.file.attrs.accept
[22:52:51] <cypha> aah ok
[22:54:04] <coldhead> cypha: you're trying to style alert()?
[22:54:30] <coldhead> the only way i know to do that is to write your own browser
[22:54:32] <Cork> lol
[22:54:48] <cypha> oh, that's firefox's alert box?
[22:54:50] <Cork> coldhead: mozilla actually had plans to support that :)
[22:55:10] <cypha> ew
[22:55:28] <coldhead> styling alert is the new blink, methinks
[22:55:52] <Cork> coldhead: no animate is
[22:56:37] <Cork> coldhead: https://developer.mozilla.org/samples/cssref/animations/cssanim3.htm
[22:57:19] * Cork loves how they reimplement things ppl has been trying hard to kill :)
[22:57:50] <cypha> i'm pretty sure most major websites style their own alerts, right?
[22:57:55] <cypha> as in, jquery popups or whatever
[22:58:20] <eddiemonge> yes but it is just html css and not the actual browser alert box
[22:58:22] <Cork> cypha: i do it at least, but it doesn't behave exactly like alerts
[22:58:38] <Cork> eddiemonge: same is true for alerts in firefox now days
[22:58:56] <cypha> so what's the jquery function to get an alert box?
[22:58:59] <Cork> except that they do freez the js
[22:59:45] <eddiemonge> cypha: theres dialog() in jquery ui
[22:59:49] <eddiemonge> jquery core doesnt have one
[23:00:06] <cypha> it's cool, i've got ui imported
[23:00:34] <Cork> cypha: http://pastebin.com/KNppsPb1
[23:00:48] <Cork> opps it has some of my own dialog extension in there...
[23:01:29] <cypha> ohh, nice Cork
[23:01:33] <Cork> http://pastebin.com/bBPphwJ2
[23:03:20] <coldhead> you are right, cypha, he IS nice
[23:03:58] <eddiemonge> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/aYbe8/
[23:04:02] <eddiemonge> slightly optimised
[23:04:36] <Cork> eddiemonge: except that is still has the extension parts ;P
[23:04:40] <Cork> but ya
[23:05:06] <eddiemonge> you dont have to append it to the dom and you should add the html before you call .dialog
[23:05:45] <Cork> eddiemonge: no not needed with height: 'auto'
[23:06:10] <cypha> sure is!
[23:07:17] <Nomikos> Is there a way to bind a function to a click to run *before* the other already bound functions?
[23:07:33] <eddiemonge> Cork: huh?  and also, this is even better: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/aYbe8/3/ cc cypha
[23:07:41] <coldhead> move it to the top of the file, Nomikos
[23:07:45] <coldhead> as in bind it first
[23:08:06] <cypha> lol, cc
[23:08:29] <coldhead> OR you can bind all the other functions to some 'fakeevent', bind the one you want to fire first to 'click' and in that function do $('whatever').trigger('fakeevent')
[23:08:42] <coldhead> except give it a better name than fakeevent
[23:08:50] <coldhead> i beseech you
[23:08:54] <Nomikos> That's the one I'm looking for, I think
[23:09:16] <Nomikos> but .. can I do that rebinding on the fly?
[23:10:01] <Nomikos> As in, take the already bound function(s), put them .. somewhere, then bind the newcomer, which will run the somewhere-stored ones
[23:10:33] <cypha> coldhead, why'd you take out security?
[23:10:48] <coldhead> que?
[23:11:11] <coldhead> Nomikos: man if that's even possible it;s a world of pain
[23:11:18] <coldhead> you'll have to find how jQuery stores the functions
[23:11:23] <coldhead> and mess with the internals
[23:11:35] <coldhead> and it all will make angels weep, i promise
[23:12:02] <cypha> coldhead, you took out the security argument of .dialog
[23:12:04] <Nomikos> Well, there's unbind(), and deferred, and queues.. I haven't played with them all
[23:12:08] <cypha> security: false
[23:13:02] <eddiemonge> yeah coldhead, whyd you do that?
[23:13:12] <coldhead> i think you mean eddie or Cork, cypha
[23:13:19] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[23:13:27] <coldhead> i wouldn't know how to do something like that
[23:13:58] <coldhead> sorry eTiger :(
[23:14:06] <eddiemonge> lol i havent heard that in forever
[23:14:14] <cypha> oh woops
[23:14:17] <cypha> yeah eddiemonge  :)
[23:14:31] <eddiemonge> cypha: do you see security in this list: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#options ?
[23:14:44] <cypha> no sir I don't
[23:14:55] <Chibby_> could anyone please advise me if there is someone way to tell if you're currently hovering over an element? (other than setting flags manually)
[23:15:58] <eddiemonge> Chibby_: you mean other than bind hover or mouseover to the element?
[23:17:23] <Nomikos> Chibby_: I guess you could go with mouse vs object coordinates, not sure there is a state you can check
[23:17:28] <Chibby_> yeah, i can't think of a way to make those work, because the event i'm listening for is a loss of focus in one element, and inside that even i want to check if the mouse is still hovering over an element
[23:18:10] <Chibby_> event*
[23:19:01] <eddiemonge> Chibby_: you mean like mouseout?
[23:20:15] <gnarf> Chibby_: elem.hover( function( e ) { $(this).data("hovered", e.type === "mouseenter" ); });
[23:21:48] <cypha> i have an unappealing "close" link at the top of my modal window
[23:21:53] <cypha> how does one get rid of that?
[23:23:04] <Chibby_> oh cool, didn't know about the data() function heh, thanks
[23:24:01] <cypha> nm
[23:27:52] <cronin> is it possible to find a form on a page that has a data-type attribute of, say, "test." so basically, find form where data-type = test
[23:28:45] <Cork> cronin: yes, you can do attribute selection
[23:29:00] <cronin> $('form').attr('data-type').val();
[23:29:01] <Cork> $('form[data-type="test"]')
[23:29:28] <Cork> no you don't use val on attrubutes
[23:29:33] <cypha> what's white-space and pre-line?
[23:29:46] <Cork> cypha: text wrapping
[23:30:24] <Cork> "Sequences of whitespace are preserved. Lines are only broken at newline characters in the source and as necessary to fill line boxes."
[23:31:02] <cypha> cool
[23:31:05] <cypha> Cork, where did you read that?
[23:31:15] <Cork> ?mdc white-space
[23:31:21] <bot-t> Cork, white-space - MDN - The white-space CSS property is used to to describe how whitespace inside the element is handled. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/white-space
[23:32:34] <cypha> ah, ok
[23:32:59] <cypha> Cork, is it possible to add a minimze button?
[23:33:29] <cypha> and maximize
[23:33:37] <Cork> cypha: you would have to extend the default dialog
[23:33:38] <cypha> and perhaps a custom button
[23:34:12] <cypha> Cork, does that mean editing the jquery-ui.js files?
[23:34:18] <Cork> no
[23:36:01] <Cork> cypha: $.extend(true, $.ui.dialog.prototype, { /* your functions here */ });
[23:38:57] <cypha> Cork, is there any documentation on how to do that?
[23:40:14] <Cork> cypha: there is some floating around here and there
[23:40:34] <Cork> but documentation about how to extend jquery ui without breaking things is scarse
[23:40:46] <Cork> and some sites give plain wrong information
[23:41:15] <Cork> (i got it working through pure labbing, after giving up on the webs solutions)
