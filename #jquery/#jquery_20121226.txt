[00:02:47] <relipse> Gmail's method of attaching files is amazing, you can drag and drop a file, or if you have an image in your clipboard you can press ctrl-v, as soon as you get the file it starts uploading showing a mini progress bar, you can cancel it or remove the attachment once it is attached.... how can I get this functionality in my bugtracker software?
[00:10:21] <raj> relipse, I think it's flash
[00:10:34] <raj> for the clipboard
[00:11:08] <relipse> actually i believe the clipboard is only for chrome.. see onpaste
[00:11:12] <raj> VectorX, eph3meral, depending on what's being clicked, it may not work in IE
[00:13:33] <VectorX> actually for what i needed,  $(".showcase").click did it
[00:13:44] <raj> k, good
[01:44:21] <mrHat> $.getJSON('script.php?price=1.00') > will 'price' value be encoded somehow ?
[01:44:42] <mrHat> how will the data travel with a getJSON? url encoded ?
[01:50:37] <johnny22> how does one find reasonable jquery plugins these days now that the plugin site is gone.. web searches seem to turn up far too many "top lists"
[02:54:18] <raj> how do I trigger an event on keypress only when inside an input box?
[02:55:05] <raj> if I return false if that input box is not infocus, seems wasteful to check if I'm in there everytime that keypress happens
[02:55:13] <raj> but if it's the best way, then sure
[02:59:46] <eph3meral> raj: you must check every time
[03:00:20] <eph3meral> er, well, no wait, just on('keydown', â€¦
[03:01:22] <raj> yeah, that's everytime that key is pressed
[03:01:37] <raj> oh wait, no it's not
[03:01:39] <raj> nice
[03:01:54] <raj> thanks, please don't be short-lived
[03:12:08] <raj> eph3meral, wasn't there osmething about not using keypress or not using keydown or something?
[03:12:15] <raj> like one of them is bad in the new version?
[03:12:35] <eph3meral> yes, there are some changes, docs will tell you what's what
[03:12:41] <eph3meral> I don't remember
[03:35:56] <raj> where is the morning shift?

[05:44:25] <Innocentus> It would be interesting
[05:45:11] <Jerbot> Could anyone tell me how to perform a function on keyup of a hotkey?
[05:45:26] <Jerbot> I'm trying to move selected text to an output field when I press a hotkey.
[05:52:27] <b2l> Jerbot, Don't know other way than $(document).on("keyup", function(e) ...
[05:52:51] <b2l> in you function, you check for e.keyCode and if it match the hotkey you want, you perform the action
[05:54:04] <b2l> skypce, don't understand your exemple, is it what you're expecting or what you got ?
[05:54:50] <Jason> hello all
[05:55:10] <skypce> b2l:  give me a second
[05:55:23] <Guest13497> hello all

[05:55:41] <skypce> i want move the a title to span
[05:55:55] <b2l> skypce, can you create a jsfiddle
[05:56:05] <skypce> ok

[05:56:56] <skypce> b2l:
[05:58:54] <Guest13497> Im having an issue getting the jquery click function to execute. i have a list and all li elements call the click function. It works the first time, but when i update the list with fresh information echoed from a php function VIA AJAX, for some reason the jquery click function no longer works. Is this because it only works on the original li elements?
[05:59:20] <b2l> skypce, so you wan't to put the <a> title to be the text for the span ?
[06:00:14] <b2l> Guest13497, you must bind the click event with the new syntax: $("ul").on("click", "li", function(e) { ... });
[06:00:33] <skypce> yes i want the a title be in a <p> tags inside spam :D
[06:01:33] <Guest13497> b21, do i have to bind it each time the update occurs?
[06:02:47] <Guest13497> or can i bind it once and when the elements update it will stay binded?
[06:03:27] <b2l> Guest13497, with this syntax, you call it just once
[06:03:29] <b2l> skypce, http://jsfiddle.net/mR79N/2/
[06:03:35] <b2l> is it what you want .
[06:03:36] <b2l> ?
[06:03:58] <Guest13497> yes
[06:04:04] <Guest13497> im going to go test now
[06:04:06] <Guest13497> brb
[06:04:25] <b2l> Guest13497, what "brb" mean ?
[06:04:45] <Guest13497> be right back
[06:04:53] <b2l> ok, thanks :)
[06:05:04] <skypce> b2l:  very thank you :D
[06:05:10] <skypce> i will test it inmediately

[06:09:22] <Guest13497> YOUR AWESOME THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YO!!!!!!!!
[06:09:34] <Guest13497> ive spent hours trying to figure this out

[06:09:53] <skypce> or i need add the normal document ready?
[06:10:21] <b2l> Guest13497, I just had the same problem some time ago, it's the kind of thing you remember :)
[06:10:38] <Guest13497> b21, thank you soooooo much
[06:10:55] <b2l> skypce, it depends on when the function will be called, for safety, you can wrap it in document ready
[06:11:13] <skypce> very thank you b2l
[06:11:23] <b2l> you're welcome
[06:12:26] <ShawnRisk> If I want everytime the class indented appears to output different html to not indent classes how do I do this?

[06:37:51] <loswillios> can someone comment on whether this is a bug in jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/THRJa/3/ - I think the .find('bz').text() should output the values, instead of nothing
[06:38:47] <Iarfen> Hi!
[06:38:52] <Iarfen> does jquery ajax support file upload? Or I have to do it "manually"?
[06:41:00] <Cronoh> loswillios why would that work?
[06:41:51] <Cronoh> this == $('.st')  so why would $(this).find() look for elements that are not its children
[06:43:05] <loswillios> Cronoh: hm, I thought $(this) would give me the new DOM (between two .st classes)
[06:43:25] <Cronoh> npoe
[06:43:28] <ajpiano> loswillios: it does. you already have it with the `this` inside of the each loop on line 5
[06:43:40] <ajpiano> the reason the find fails is beacuse you're looking for a .bz inside of the .bz
[06:46:27] <loswillios> so the solution is to remove $(this) because it will look on the sub-DOM anyway?
[06:47:01] <ajpiano> the solution is not to use the .find(".bz") when `this` is a bz
[06:47:28] <ajpiano> loswillios: perhaps you're confused because you are not realising that the `this` changes inside of the each loops
[06:47:51] <ajpiano> ?
[06:47:59] <loswillios> aah, ok
[06:48:32] <loswillios> I need to check what Cronoh said, if this == $('.bz')?
[06:49:31] <ajpiano> what you need is to learn how to debug your code and interrogate what 'this' is using your debugger :)
[06:49:50] <loswillios> alright ;) thanks for the pointer
[06:49:52] <ajpiano> see ?ftj
[06:49:52] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[06:51:43] <Jerbot> is there a selector for the selected text in a textarea?
[06:51:58] <ajpiano> nope
[06:52:17] <loswillios> ajpiano: got it with if (this.className == "bz") {..} thanks!
[06:52:17] <ajpiano> jQuery doesn't offer much in the way of utilities for working with selection ranges
[06:52:42] <skypce> guys
[06:53:03] <skypce> what is the <a>this </a>
[06:53:05] <skypce> this
[06:53:18] <skypce> it will be the title?
[06:53:34] <skypce> how can i set this attribute?
[06:53:43] <ajpiano> it's not clear what you're asking, skypce
[06:53:43] <skypce> with title it doesnt work
[06:54:02] <ajpiano> the text?
[06:54:05] <skypce> yes
[06:54:11] <ajpiano> .text("foo")
[06:54:17] <skypce> <a>text</a>
[06:54:29] <skypce> the text is inside ancles?
[06:54:40] <ajpiano> yes
[06:55:07] <skypce> excellent
[06:55:14] <skypce> thank you ajm203
[06:55:17] <skypce> ajpiano:
[07:03:49] <Jerbot> Is there an easy way to override the default keyboard shortcuts in a browser?
[07:06:06] <loswillios> ajpiano: the classname check works, but shouldn't this also work? http://jsfiddle.net/THRJa/5/
[07:06:47] <ajpiano> no
[07:07:00] <ajpiano> .find looks inside of elements for descedants
[07:07:11] <ajpiano> $(".bz", dom) is the same as $(dom).find(".bz")
[07:07:22] <ajpiano> dom.filter(".bz") would do it
[07:08:48] <loswillios> ah, .find is operating a level deeper, and .filter() on toplevel? will read more on filter, thanks
[07:20:19] <Jerbot> could you tell me what I'm doing wrong in the second one: http://jsfiddle.net/Ywq2x/14/ ?
[07:20:39] <Jerbot> trying to make it so that ctrl+b outputs the text
[07:29:24] <Jerbot> Strange, right?
[07:30:58] <Jerbot> I have some other idea.  I'll figure it out, I suppose.
[07:50:29] <Jerbot> It's just odd imo because you can style selected in css, but you can't target it with jquery
[07:51:52] <tw2113> not sure :selection is valid
[07:51:59] <tw2113> but i could be wrong
[07:57:05] <jeffsmykil> So changePage() has no callback?
[08:01:13] <Jerbot> Welllll, I saw it work in css, but it was in context, you know?
[08:01:34] <Jerbot> http://jsfiddle.net/ThinkingStiff/FcCgA/
[08:02:09] <Jerbot> Last part of the css
[08:04:28] <Jerbot> at Tw2... ah he's gone
[08:05:48] <Jerbot> Another example: http://jsfiddle.net/duhTB/
[08:05:55] <Jerbot> but can you target selection using jquery?
[08:06:25] <Jerbot> alright.  i'm crashing.  good night.

[09:30:38] <simon____> hi !
[09:30:52] <simon____> I have a question about $.ajax function
[09:30:58] <simon____> Can you help me ?
[09:31:58] <simon____> How use $.ajax in local file ? (Just a .html file on my disk)
[09:33:09] <Eviltwin> AJAX doesn't work too well in most browsers for the file:// protocol
[09:33:35] <Eviltwin> Nost of them err on the side of caution and don't let you fetch anything
[09:34:03] <simon____> So I need to work online ? With Wamp is OK ?
[09:41:03] <scar> how can i highlight/select text? for example, have say a <span></span> and when clicked, that textinside gets highlighted
[09:43:39] <tw2113> you could add a class to the span and that class has background color rules
[09:44:06] <astropirate> ehhhh thats not real selection though
[09:44:53] <scar> yeah, i need it for copy/paste
[09:45:17] <scar> maybe i need to revert to good ole js
[09:45:53] <scar> tw2113, thank you for thinkin like i would... haha
[09:47:14] <tw2113> who said we were right though?
[09:47:21] <tw2113> it's just the first method that came to mind
[09:47:38] <tw2113> what would "good ole js" do that jQuery couldn't scar?
[09:48:33] <scar> tw2113, i am not sure. a lot of things i found online had JS methods, so i just was guessing that maybe JS is better than jQuery at some things...
[09:48:50] <tw2113> jQuery is js
[09:48:53] <tw2113> and they can mingle
[09:49:21] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/aduvom/1/edit
[09:49:50] <scar> i thought jquery was a framework of js
[09:50:10] <scar> does the .select() method not work?
[09:50:22] <scar> i imagie it would be the same as "tabbing" over to that item
[09:50:40] <scar> nope, doesnt werk :P
[09:50:45] <tw2113> jQuery is a library
[09:51:20] <scar> i was aware they could mingle
[09:53:18] <JoannA> hi. Please I need a led banner scroller plugin, something like this http://jsbin.com/ihuqug/1 . do you know if there is anything? sorry... I can't find anything reliable :(
[09:56:58] <Whirl3d> scar, it is kind of tricky to get "selected" text from a browser because of various implementations. There are some jquery plugins like "caret" that help, but they aren't very reliable.
[09:58:53] <scar> Whirl3d, perhaps JS rather than jQuery? or is that still yielding the same problem with unreliability bc of browser variants?
[09:58:59] <Whirl3d> JoannA, could you use a text-scroller and a webfont?
[09:59:56] <Whirl3d> jquery is js
[10:00:19] <JoannA> Whirl3d: yes, if it is kind of a led banner, i mean a background simulating leds and text scrolling/rolling
[10:01:14] <Whirl3d> JoannA, a scroller is would be easy to produce, but you would have to find a LED font that that you could use.
[10:01:20] <JoannA> Whirl3d: there is this one but i can't get it to work
[10:01:21] <JoannA> http://ajaxray.com/blog/jquery-led-scrolling-banner-fun-plugin
[10:02:34] <Whirl3d> JoannA, are you familiar with jsfiddle? setup a jsfiddle and post the link here if you will.
[10:02:35] <JoannA> Whirl3d: no problem about led fonts :-> some here for instance http://djdesignerlab.com/2010/11/14/20-best-useful-digital-fonts-for-led-banner-designing/
[10:02:54] <tw2113> marquee!
[10:03:09] <JoannA> Whirl3d: yes i am familiar w jsfiddle :)
[10:04:14] <JoannA> Whirl3d: the one i gave you the url is to produce somethink for MySpace websites and  i modified it to show you
[10:04:15] <Whirl3d> Great link about LED fonts, I haven't seen most of those.
[10:04:51] <tw2113> LED style marquees remind me of the late 90s
[10:05:03] <JoannA> Whirl3d: i have it for days already while i'm checking for some jquery plugin to include those fonts
[10:05:35] <JoannA> tw2113: yes, but they are outdated now. most of them were marquee
[10:05:43] <JoannA> or javascript
[10:05:52] <tw2113> the implementation wasn't what i was worried about :P
[10:06:01] <tw2113> more the impression it gives
[10:06:42] <Whirl3d> JoannA, I am completely missing you now. Sorry. You have the code to do what you want, just inlcude the fonts in your document header styles
[10:07:42] <JoannA> Whirl3d: but the sample from jsfiddle i gave you uses flash
[10:08:23] <JoannA> Whirl3d: http://jsbin.com/ihuqug/1/edit
[10:13:00] <JoannA> there is this one but in pure js and too heavy for browsers. it produces in loop a lot of css . http://selfhtml.jstruebig.de/led.html
[10:13:59] <Whirl3d> so you want to control each LED? Why not just scroll the text and rely on the font to provide the LED simulation
[10:15:40] <JoannA> Whirl3d: that one i just gave you, more updated. still, too heavy: http://javascript.jstruebig.de/javascript/305
[10:16:05] <JoannA> Whirl3d: i would like to control the text...
[10:16:46] <tw2113> <marquee> + @font-face + some css
[10:17:03] <JoannA> i like that one in fact
[10:17:51] <JoannA> if you check it with firebug you'll be admired with the amount of CSS it produces
[10:18:45] <tw2113> http://jsbin.com/ayoqoq/1/edit
[10:19:36] <JoannA> :) now... just need to make a led grid background
[10:20:07] <JoannA> or with a smal img maybe, kyrix
[10:20:46] <tw2113> refresh it
[10:22:44] <tw2113> ah the power of css and the modern web
[10:22:49] <tw2113> we can give marquee scales
[10:22:54] <JoannA> tw2113: looks good but i think the b ck font is messed or too light
[10:23:06] <JoannA> the bkg, i mean
[10:23:07] <tw2113> customize as much as you want
[10:23:10] <tw2113> i'm just demoing
[10:23:18] <JoannA> yes, its easy :)
[10:23:33] <JoannA> thanks so much for the idea tw2113
[10:23:50] <tw2113> if you're going for 100% valid markup, you won't get it with marquee
[10:23:57] <tw2113> but you will get the browser support from the looks of it
[10:24:07] <tw2113> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Element/marquee
[10:24:09] <JoannA> it's exactly something simple what i need, like that
[10:24:14] <Whirl3d> tw2113, showoff. LOL I was working on a jquery version, but it's so much better your way.
[10:24:24] <JoannA> hehehe
[10:25:09] <JoannA> i'm not into coding so "deep" as you are, so i only need the kick off point
[10:25:19] <JoannA> thanks a lot
[10:25:34] <tw2113> http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/
[10:26:54] <JoannA> great patterns :)

[11:02:57] <skypce> i have this code
[11:03:01] <skypce> it doesnt work
[11:03:02] <skypce> jQuery(".field-name-body").appendTo(".field-name-field-fondo");
[11:03:08] <skypce> what can be wrong?
[11:03:20] <skypce> please
[11:12:11] <astropirate> skypce, i have bicycle and i ride it. what can go wrong?
[11:13:22] <skypce> astropirate: i do know jquery i need some help
[11:13:31] <skypce> astropirate: i dont know jquery i need some help
[11:14:31] <astropirate> skypce, thats fine
[11:14:37] <astropirate> but you should ask your question
[11:14:42] <astropirate> a specific one
[11:24:55] <wroathe> astropirate: :P
[11:25:12] <wroathe> astropirate: You mean you can't understand what his problem is by reading what should normally be working code?
[11:29:19] <imgadmin> Yo guys, lookin for some SEO/jQuery/AJAX help. Anyone here familiar with the combo?
[11:33:01] <PKKid> If I have a list of selected object in jQuery, is there an easy way to get a list of some attr from all their IDs?  or do I need to loop using $.each() ?
[11:33:46] <PKKid> something like.. $('.foobars').attr('id') -- But have it be a list of ALL ids, and not just the first
[11:34:45] <wroathe> imgadmin: Sure. Fire away.
[11:36:24] <imgadmin> wroathe: Awesome, A good example of what I'm trying to is GitHub. If you've ever been you'd see that you can click a link and the URL changes in but the whole page doesn't reload. I've been try to reverse engineer their technique but is taking way to long. How do they do that?
[11:36:32] <imgadmin> There are no iFrames either
[11:36:50] <Jzarecta> hi I got an issue trying to make this JQuery work
[11:36:57] <Jzarecta> I have the following rules
[11:37:18] <Jzarecta> $("#matanzas").mouseenter( function(){makeHidden('matanzas');} );
[11:37:27] <Jzarecta> $("#matanzas").mouseleave( function(){makeVisible('matanzas');} );
[11:37:42] <Jzarecta> but when I put it on, it says the following error
[11:38:18] <Jzarecta> ReferenceError: makeHidden is not defined
[11:38:30] <imgadmin> Jzarecta: I assume makeHidden()
[11:38:37] <snollux>  I have several booleans that are activated and deactivated on mouseenter and mouseleave. What's a good way to set up something to "watch" all of these variables and do something when a certain condition is met?
[11:38:50] <imgadmin> makeKidden is not a native Jquery function I don't think
[11:38:50] <Jzarecta> imgadmin what you mean?
[11:38:59] <Jzarecta> oh really? umm...
[11:39:00] <snollux> I know I need to have the if() block inside a function, but I'm not sure where to bind the function or how to poll it
[11:39:05] <imgadmin> Use show() or hide()
[11:39:07] <snollux> I don't want to just call it on each event
[11:39:10] <imgadmin> or fadeIn(800)
[11:39:13] <imgadmin> or something like that
[11:39:25] <Jzarecta> imgadmin ok will try with that
[11:40:01] <imgadmin> And you'd need to make $(funtion () { inside your mouseEnter
[11:40:45] <Jzarecta> imgadmin I get the same error with show-hide
[11:40:50] <Jzarecta> hide is not defined
[11:41:30] <dismist> what is wrong with this???? $('.question a').click(function() { $(this).parent().siblings('dd').show(); });
[11:41:34] <Jzarecta> imgadmin I have the followings
[11:41:44] <Jzarecta> 	$("#LaHabana").mouseenter( function(){hide('LaHabana_C');} );
[11:42:01] <meckanism> Jzarecta: you need to use $(this).hide()
[11:42:02] <imgadmin> $("#matanzas").mouseenter( $( function() { $('.selector').show(); }); );
[11:42:04] <imgadmin> Something like that
[11:42:04] <meckanism> not just hide()
[11:42:33] <Jzarecta> ok
[11:43:13] <dismist> how would i get the immediate dd elements after a dt?
[11:43:13] <imgadmin> wroathe: see what I'm talking about?
[11:43:19] <wroathe> imgadmin: The way they do that is by the History API. Frameworks like Backbone use that to emulate paths for AJAX navigation.
[11:43:26] <Pilate> dismist: .find?
[11:44:02] <imgadmin> wroathe: really!? Okay... I'm not familiar with backbone but I'll have to open it up. No pun intended.
[11:44:10] <imgadmin> Does jQuery support history API?
[11:44:16] <dismist> pilate: wont that get all the dd's and not just the ones until the next dt?
[11:44:41] <imgadmin> dismist: Use a selector
[11:45:49] <dismist> $('dd').hide(); $('dt a').click(function() { $(this).parent().find('dd').show(); });
[11:46:32] <dismist> nothin.
[11:49:17] <imgadmin> wroathe: Consider this, when opperating without caching any DNS, I still don't see pages loading. Each time a make request my browser will act as if it were the first time (for development). There for, they must be useing some kind of jaquery ajax on before function? Does that make sense?
[11:50:12] <crankharder> how do I attach a submit event handler to a form that isn't on the page yet with on?  seems that this doesn't work: $('body').on('submit', 'form.foo'...
[11:51:30] <MistuhKurtz> crankharder, try this
[11:51:36] <Falgun> hi
[11:51:44] <MistuhKurtz> wait..
[11:51:53] <Falgun> https://www.facebook.com/ElitesHub
[11:51:55] <MistuhKurtz> crankharder, can you set up a fiddle? because the way you described should work
[11:52:22] <danheberden> crankharder: http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/q5NwT/
[11:52:41] <danheberden> you're doing it right - i assume something is messed up with your form element
[11:52:44] <crankharder> form isn't on the page at onload
[11:54:00] <danheberden> crankharder: for those lacking imagination: http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/q5NwT/1/
[11:54:31] <crankharder> k, thanks
[11:56:05] <danheberden> falgun
[11:56:11] <danheberden> ugh - already left
[11:56:11] <dismist> i tried this too: $('dd').hide(); $('dt').click(function(e) { alert('click'); $(this).nextUntil('dt').toggleClass('show'); });
[11:56:19] <dismist> i cant even get the click alert to fire
[11:57:19] <MistuhKurtz> ?jsfiddle @ dismist
[11:57:19] <bot-t> dismist, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[11:59:34] <snollux> any ideas about my function? where to bind it, etc.
[12:01:43] <danheberden> snollux: you can't "watch" variables, so it might help for you to make a small demo of what you mean on jsfiddle or something
[12:05:14] <snollux> danheberden: http://pastebin.com/j6Pp1LZ4 yeah, I guess I'm not sure where and when to run the check that won't be redundant/repeat http://pastebin.com/j6Pp1LZ4
[12:05:18] <snollux> for the if satement
[12:10:41] <danheberden> snollux: http://pastebin.com/udkMnnge
[12:10:55] <danheberden> oops - "e.id" should be "this.id"
[12:10:59] <danheberden> but you get the idea i'm sure
[12:11:03] <danheberden> see line 17 though
[12:11:18] <danheberden> since you seem to just care when the mouse is inside of something
[12:11:45] <danheberden> mouseover/mouseout might be more helpful
[12:13:52] <skypce> hello
[12:13:56] <skypce> it is right?var text = $(this).find("a").text().attr("href");
[12:14:12] <skypce> i want put in a var the text and href of a link
[12:19:08] <skypce> hey guys
[12:19:14] <skypce> i am modifyng a function
[12:19:15] <skypce> http://jsfiddle.net/HS6fX/
[12:19:35] <skypce> how can i set the href
[12:23:08] <snollux> the problem with that, danheberden, is that the "upper" class contains several images that are in different divs. Even though they are "touching" each other (and don't look separate) the script sees moving from one image to another as a mouseOut
[12:23:23] <snollux> even though to a user it looks like one solid image
[12:23:37] <danheberden> then make a class just for those two
[12:23:43] <danheberden> it was just as an example/placeholder
[12:23:54] <danheberden> as i wasn't aware of your existing dom
[12:23:58] <danheberden> snollux ^
[12:25:04] <snollux> danheberden: no no I'm still not expressing myself correctly. Your "upper" class is exactly correct for describing just those two objects. The problem is that a mouseOut is detected even _within_ that class, for some reason
[12:25:25] <danheberden> oh, right - you can just verify the target then
[12:25:43] <danheberden> if ( $(this).is( '.upper' ) ) or something
[12:25:57] <danheberden> or /upper/.test( this.className )
[12:25:59] <danheberden> whatevs
[12:26:13] <danheberden> i imagine there is a much better way to do what you're trying to do
[12:26:33] <danheberden> but i'm just trying to fix the small pieces you're presenting. it might be worth making a demo of this whole little thing on jsfiddle or something
[12:26:50] <danheberden> you could do it with pics of cute kittens using http://placekitten.com/
[12:26:52] <danheberden> :p
[12:28:36] <snollux> haha nice!
[12:31:44] <Tomashe> hey guys i dont get it i run this : $.getJSON(jsonp_url, function(data) { alert(data.html); }); and my jsonp_url contain this code { "html" : "<strong>Hello World!</strong>" } and i got error : /
[12:31:59] <Tomashe> SyntaxError: invalid label [Break On This Error] { "html" : "<strong>Hello World!</strong>" }
[12:33:09] <TimothyA> I have some issued with $.ajax. This is probably more of a regular JS question, though: How do I access the url that the xhr object has requested?
[12:33:19] <TimothyA> such as after a redirect
[12:43:18] <Tomashe> ReferenceError: callback is not defined
[12:44:44] <cambazz> hello, i have a form with a sinle select element, previously i had a onchange="form.submit();" on the select, and now i want to use $('select.shiptocode').bind('change', function()...
[12:44:58] <cambazz> how do I submit the form, without knowing its id
[12:45:04] <cambazz> on change
[12:45:18] <cambazz> (there are many forms of same class in same page)
[12:45:55] <pifantastic> cambazz: maybe: $('select.shiptocode').closest('form').submit();
[12:48:50] <cambazz> pifantastic: i was thinking of a $(this).parent().parent().submit();
[12:49:20] <pifantastic> cambazz: that's a bit more brittle, as it twill break if your HTML changes much
[12:50:19] <daedeloth> is there a way to give normal objects bind & trigger capabilities?
[12:51:21] <pifantastic> daedeloth: Backbone has an Events class
[12:51:33] <daedeloth> yea but I'm not using backbone right now
[13:11:19] <TimothyA> screw it, I'm going to do this the wrong way.
[13:12:35] <raj> no, don't
[13:16:17] <nitrospectide1> is there a way to hand .focus two functions for in and out like you can with .hover?
[13:18:39] <wathek> hi everybody
[13:19:31] <TimothyA> raj: well, nobody has answered my question
[13:19:39] <TimothyA> and I can't find the final destination url anywhere in the xhr object
[13:20:25] <wathek> I got a problem I'm trying to get the body height after the page is being loaded I tried to do jQuery(window).load(function() { console.log(jQuery("body").height()); }); but it doesn't return the real height I tried with jQuery(document).ready(function() {....}); and got the same problem
[13:20:39] <TimothyA> wathek: outerHeight() ?
[13:20:48] <wathek> TimothyA, let me try that
[13:21:02] <raj> TimothyA, can you explain morE?
[13:21:09] <TimothyA> raj: that's all there is to it
[13:21:18] <TimothyA> I'm trying to get the url which xhr last tried to access
[13:22:30] <raj> and failed?
[13:24:10] <TimothyA> raj: I am just trying to get the url of the last accessed resource.
[13:24:16] <TimothyA> e.g. after a redirect
[13:24:41] <gataraid> How would one find out what, or set an index value to each slide of a slideshow/presentation ?
[13:24:45] <ep1032> hey all, I'm confused about testing my JS/Jquery code with things like QUnit/JSTest/etc.  When I write JS tests, there seem to be two choices, put the test file in the production html code, and strip it out again before deploying to live, or using a testrunner html file, and mocking up the html, which may be significantly different than what actually exists in the html at production time.  Are
[13:24:45] <ep1032> these the only two real options?  I've heard one developer say to use unit testing only on JS methods of suitable complexity, to prove that the internal logic is sound, then test both the html and JS layers simultaneously with somthing like selenium.  Could anyone lend me their experience, or point me towards a good blog/book?
[13:25:12] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/mvUtkNfk - this is what I am using
[13:25:58] <wathek> TimothyA, http://www-test.lacriee.com/ I don't understand why I'm not getting the real height it seems that a small portion of the page isn't counted
[13:26:18] <gataraid> nevermind, I can pass idx it seems
[13:36:45] <Tomashe> anyone knows why the hell when i do jsonget request i get SyntaxError: syntax error
[13:36:46] <Tomashe> [Break On This Error] 	
[13:36:46] <Tomashe> ? ( {'html': '<strong>Hello World!</strong>' } )
[13:36:48] <bot-t> Tomashe, .append() - Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[13:42:41] <shoky> Tomashe:  what you showed isn't proper JSON
[13:42:50] <shoky> assuming that's the response..
[13:44:55] <imsky> hrr
[13:45:03] <Tomashe> yes
[13:45:27] <shoky> {"html": "<strong>Hello World!</strong>"}  would be proper
[13:45:34] <Tomashe>  var jsonp_url = "http://www.domain.com/widget/data.js?callback=?";        $.getJSON(jsonp_url, function(data) {			alert(data.html);          $('#widget').html("This data comes from another server: " + data.html);        });
[13:45:42] <Tomashe> hmm
[13:45:45] <shoky> uhm
[13:45:55] <shoky> you're trying to do a JSONP requesT?
[13:45:55] <Tomashe> but http://alexmarandon.com/articles/web_widget_jquery/
[13:45:59] <Tomashe> yes
[13:46:05] <shoky> so don't use .getJSON
[13:46:13] <shoky> that's for a regular JSON request
[13:46:17] <Tomashe> ok
[13:46:18] <Tomashe> so
[13:46:18] <shoky> use $.ajax
[13:46:23] <shoky> with dataType: 'jsonp'
[13:46:31] <Tomashe> ok let me try
[13:46:39] <shoky> well
[13:46:57] <shoky> maybe jquery tries to do jsonp anyway when seeing that callback=?   i'm not sure
[13:47:10] <shoky> but using dataTYpe: 'jsonp'  is the safest bet
[13:47:55] <shoky> Tomashe: also, what does the response look like exactly?
[13:48:40] <Tomashe> atm the moment : ? ( {'html': '<strong>Hello World!</strong>' } )
[13:48:42] <shoky> (not the JSON. the response itself that is output by the server and received by the browser)
[13:48:55] <shoky> what?  that question mark is there?
[13:49:08] <shoky> ah k.
[13:49:15] <shoky> ya, try $.ajax
[13:49:32] <Tomashe> ok im trying but doesnt seems to work hmm
[13:51:03] <Tomashe> :/
[13:54:09] <Tomashe> http://codepad.org/NuR5FxnI
[13:54:12] <Tomashe> this is what i got now
[13:55:05] <Tomashe> my url contain data.js which have this info inside { 'html': '<strong>Hello World!</strong>' }
[13:55:49] <Tomashe> it doesnt even alert me
[13:56:58] <Tomashe> ok
[13:57:04] <Tomashe> i fixed but now i get same eror as before
[13:59:50] <shoky> dataType  not dataTYpe
[14:00:31] <shoky> and don't alert
[14:00:35] <Tomashe> ok now its working
[14:00:35] <shoky> console.log(data)
[14:00:45] <Tomashe> no no i change that typo long time ago
[14:00:53] <shoky> k..
[14:01:18] <Tomashe> ok now all fixed
[14:35:56] <Tomashe> tell me something, can i pass parameters to another js file ?
[14:36:09] <Tomashe> like widget.js?uid=123
[14:36:22] <Tomashe> and then when it loads the js it will know the 123
[14:40:24] <Guest25572> hi
[14:40:29] <Tomashe> nvm
[14:40:36] <Guest25572> Any good book for learning jquery?
[15:01:03] <zg> hi
[15:01:32] <zg> I have html setup like this: <span class="prompt"><span class="response">blah blah</span><br>some text</span>
[15:01:56] <zg> how do I remove the <span> tag for .response without removing the text within or messing up the location/formatting
[15:02:17] <zg> so, I might have something like this: <span class="prompt"><span class="response">blah blah</span><br>hello hello<span class="response">test</span></span>
[15:02:31] <zg> I'd want the output to be <span class="prompt">blah blah<br>hellotest</span>

[15:09:02] <coldhead> Hopsy: that sounds like the kind of thing vladikoff would know about
[15:09:04] <zg> :P
[15:10:27] <coldhead> you could so use text() if you didn't want to keep the <br>
[15:10:36] <Hopsy> hi vladikoff !
[15:10:39] <vladikoff> Hopsy, use $ vncviewer
[15:10:47] <coldhead> god bless you flod
[15:10:49] <Hopsy> ow
[15:10:59] <shoky> zg:  $('.response').replaceWith(function() { return $(this).contents() })
[15:11:29] <Hopsy> hmm
[15:11:31] <Hopsy> http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=names&keywords=vncviewer
[15:11:41] <Hopsy> gtknvncviewer?
[15:11:42] <vladikoff> Hopsy, just type vncviewer in the terminal
[15:12:07] <Hopsy> ow its already installed haha
[15:12:23] <vladikoff> Hopsy, yea the xtightvncviewer thing maps to vncviewer
[15:13:29] <Hopsy> I typed: $ vncviewer 192.168.1.101
[15:13:37] <Hopsy> outputs sefmentation fault
[15:13:57] <Hopsy> I did the same with sudo, nothing happens
[15:14:00] <vladikoff> Hopsy, hopefully this helps http://pwet.fr/man/linux/commandes/xtightvncviewer , you probably need ports or displays

[15:19:02] <FunnyLookinHat> Anyone here know how I'd take an Image object and set the background image of a div or whatnot to it ?
[15:19:18] <shoky> yup
[15:20:29] <shoky> $('div').css('background-image', 'url(' + img.src ')')
[15:20:58] <shoky> forgot a +

[15:21:15] <FunnyLookinHat> thx shoky
[15:22:30] <obert> hi, when i got two diff functions in a $() why if the first one returns errors, the script wont continue to apply the second function?
[15:23:13] <shoky> obert: each script stops running when there's an uncaught error
[15:23:30] <shoky> doesn't matter what function it's in
[15:23:43] <obert> each?
[15:23:50] <shoky> each <script>
[15:24:03] <obert> hmm
[15:24:15] <obert> i got everything in a single file
[15:24:24] <shoky> how about.. fix the errors?
[15:24:35] <obert> i just moved the second function before the other and now it works
[15:24:41] <shoky> sigh
[15:24:45] <shoky> ?learn
[15:24:45] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:24:55] <obert> ?
[15:25:06] <shoky> ??
[15:25:23] <obert> it isnt about learn js. it is about use different files per page:P
[15:25:42] <shoky> if you say so
[15:26:02] <obert> then i'll dont get an uncaught error in the page
[15:26:13] <obert> thanks for the advice anywya
[15:26:51] <obert> i say so.
[15:27:08] <shoky> and so it is.
[15:27:19] <obert> mhmh
[15:27:35] <aaairc> i'm trying to do HTTP response streaming with the chunked response type... i have a controller setup to send chunked responses, but i don't know what the jquery side would look like to process the chunked results
[15:27:37] <obert> it is just boring to have to create other files.
[15:27:39] <aaairc> does anyone have guidance?
[15:29:29] <gordian> hey guys, i'm having some issues with jQuery.offset() in Safari on OS X
[15:29:33] <gordian> my site is here: http://goo.gl/viWk0
[15:29:39] <zg> coldhead: that works :D
[15:29:43] <zg> thank you! :)
[15:29:55] <gordian> when i click any of the blue nav links it should scroll to the appropriate column
[15:30:08] <gordian> but in Safari the distance from screen left is off
[15:30:19] <gordian> you can see this by clicking on the same nav link twice
[15:30:22] <gordian> it will correct itself
[15:30:33] <gordian> but ideally it should be correct when it's clicked once
[15:30:41] <gordian> any help would be greatly appreciated
[15:30:52] <gordian> works fine in Chrome and FF btw
[15:31:04] <obert> shoky: why did you told me to learn js? about what
[15:31:39] <obert> shoky: because i didnt knew that uncaught errors stop everything below?
[15:32:55] <shoky> obert: because you said    <obert> i just moved the second function before the other and now it works
[15:33:17] <shoky> obert:  which made is seem that you're just randomly doing stuff without really knowing what it does
[15:35:57] <gordian> can someone at least shed some light on whether my issue is in my script, my implementation, or possibly jQuery itself?
[15:42:30] <coldhead> gordian: it's probably not jQuery
[15:42:35] <coldhead> i don't have safari to test
[15:42:49] <gordian> any ideas what it could be?
[15:42:54] <coldhead> i would guess it might be some subtle difference in how the CSS for the page is handled
[15:43:08] <gordian> hmmm
[15:43:13] <coldhead> the code looks okay
[15:43:38] <coldhead> i would guess you might be getting odd offsets while animations are occuring
[15:43:47] <coldhead> or when elements aren't rendered yet
[15:43:59] <coldhead> just a guess
[15:45:06] <obert> shoky: so-so, if that fixed the issue means what you said: uncaught error stops everything
[15:45:13] <gordian> bollocks
[15:45:54] <obert> shoky: then or i move the function applied to that specific page in another file to dont include both functions, or a invert their order in that single file
[15:45:54] <coldhead> gordian: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2426802/jquery-offset-not-working-in-some-browsers-on-some-computers
[15:46:03] <coldhead> they have a fix with width:100%
[15:46:17] <wroathe> bollocks indeed
[15:46:22] <wroathe> I wish I was English
[15:46:23] <obert> shoky: anyway improve knowledge would be always better
[15:46:54] <gordian> coldhead: thank you! i'll try it!
[15:47:23] <coldhead> good luck gordian
[15:48:27] <gordian> sadly that doesn't appear to work

[15:50:55] <apple1004> Hi All,
[15:51:39] <coldhead> gordian: you could do a lil setTimeout to trigger a second click
[15:52:06] <gordian> that's so dirty
[15:52:13] <gordian> i'd rather not--only as a last resort
[15:52:18] <shoky> gordian: looks ok to me in safari
[15:52:32] <shoky> this safari might be a bit old tho
[15:52:32] <gordian> shoky: click around a bit
[15:52:46] <wroathe> gordian: What browser are you looking at it in?
[15:53:15] <gordian> wroathe: in Chrome and FF it looks fine, but the problem is Safari (6.0.2)
[15:53:31] <shoky> gordian: its not breaking heh
[15:53:36] <shoky> oh my
[15:53:40] <shoky> im an idiot, nevermind.
[15:53:44] <shoky> :D
[15:54:26] <gordian> i'm hoping i'm the idiot and i just missed something really stupid
[15:54:47] <wroathe> gordian: What operating system? I don't see the problem?
[15:54:52] <gordian> OS X
[15:55:02] <wroathe> Hmm, I'm on the latest version and I don't see the problem.
[15:55:07] <shoky> heh..
[15:55:09] <gordian> 10.8.2
[15:55:16] <shoky> ok well. i was an idiot and ran chrome on OSX before.
[15:55:22] <gordian> hehe
[15:55:22] <shoky> but.. now i ran safari and it still works :P
[15:55:28] <gordian> weird
[15:55:40] <shoky> safari 5.1.7 though
[15:55:45] <gordian> ahh
[15:55:51] <shoky> best i can do sry :P
[15:56:07] <gordian> so strange
[15:56:09] <gordian> and annoying
[15:56:10] <shoky> oh i see wroathe is onto it also
[15:58:08] <gordian> and driving me mad!
[15:58:44] <wroathe> shoky: :) I don't even see his problem.
[15:59:04] <wroathe> gordian: You said the offset was off?
[15:59:08] <shoky> maybe he needs to see someone.
[15:59:32] <gordian> well when the scroll happens the left side of the image should line up with the H1 in the nav bar
[15:59:37] <gordian> that offset is 50px
[15:59:58] <gordian> sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't and it requires 2 clicks

[16:09:01] <wroathe> gordian: Hmm, gordion, I don't see that.
[16:09:26] <nitrospectide> is there a way to hand .focus two functions for in and out like you can with .hover?
[16:10:23] <wroathe> nitrospectide: No, the two events you're looking for are focus and blur
[16:11:26] <wroathe> nitrospectide: If you want to use the same function though you could do something like: $(...).on('focus blur', function (e) { // doStuff });
[16:12:27] <nitrospectide> wroathe: hmm. ok. thanks.

[17:49:29] <shoky> imgadmin: "getting undefined" ?
[17:53:20] <bencahill> Okay guys, I've been working on this for over two hours now, and I'm getting quite frustrated!
[17:53:35] <bencahill> Okay, I've got some inputs, and I'm putting autocomplete on them.
[17:55:24] <bencahill> Then, I clone one to get a new one. I can NOT get the new one(s) to get autocomplete. I've tried destroying autocomplete and re-doing it, after and around (destroy,clone,re-do) the clone. I've also tried doing $(document).on('keydown.autocomplete','myselector',function(){ $(this).autocomplete(options); }); . No luck. Any suggestions?
[17:55:58] <bencahill> BTW, the clone is being done with relCopy, and is a clone(true) (withDataAndEvents, but not deep)
[17:57:22] <bencahill> Also, I'm using Opera, so just to check my sanity, it also doesn't work in Chrome.
[18:16:09] <bencahill> $(#jquery).wakeup('now');

[18:59:02] <Glycan> I belive there's an .html method for elements...
[19:00:41] <Glycan> you should google "setting html of elements with jQuery" or something like that
[19:01:53] <ShawnRisk> Glycan:  I have an ideas

[19:30:36] <sheilablackrose> anyone up for a challenge http://jsfiddle.net/XNds5/4/
[19:31:15] <quijote> zg, newbie here but what about var theLength = $('selector').length;
[19:31:31] <quijote> someone back me up
[19:31:35] <quijote> or break me up
[19:31:40] <zg> var theLength=$('<script>').length;console.log(theLength);
[19:31:40] <zg> 1
[19:31:46] <zg> fail :P
[19:31:53] <zg> It's parsing the HTML, then calculating the length
[19:32:06] <zg> good try though, interesting perspective
[19:32:26] <quijote> I just jumped in. I  actually need some help myself
[19:32:46] <zg> maybe I could be of assistance? :)
[19:32:54] <quijote> yeah
[19:33:20] <quijote> I have a ul li ul li nesting
[19:33:49] <quijote> wait I think I just answer my own question
[19:33:50] <quijote> hold on
[19:34:16] <zg> rofl
[19:34:29] <sheilablackrose> :)
[20:07:58] <zg> how do I get the actual length of <script>
[20:08:04] <zg> $('<script>').length = 1
[20:13:29] <tw2113> var thelength = $('<script>').length;
[20:14:04] <zg> tw2113: var theLength=$('<script>').length;console.log(theLength); -> 1
[20:15:01] <tw2113> maybe you need the contents inside the <script> tag
[20:15:17] <zg> tw2113: go here: http://term.qt.io
[20:15:22] <zg> type in <script></script> then try to do backspace
[20:15:53] <zg> everything that's typed inside the "prompt" is in a <span class="input">
[20:15:53] <defaultro> hey guys, I always forget what this code does
[20:16:08] <tw2113> looks not well coded
[20:16:10] <defaultro> var somevar = $('<div>some string</div>');
[20:16:10] <zg> so, when you type backspace, this is what I do: if(0 < $('.input').html().length) $('.input').html($('.input').html().slice(0,-1));
[20:16:16] <tw2113> i could type alkdfnadklshfa;sdgf and still only backspace 1 time
[20:16:28] <tw2113> unless you're working on coding it still
[20:16:31] <zg> tw2113: what do you mean
[20:16:34] <tw2113> then i'll stop nitpicking
[20:16:47] <zg> I can backspace all the way in Chrome
[20:16:51] <zg> FIREFOX USER IDENTIFIED
[20:16:56] <tw2113> and proud of it
[20:16:59] <zg> what's the fix though? I remembered this being an issue in Firefox ...
[20:17:09] <zg> I do $.live({  ... keypress ... keydown })
[20:17:26] <zg> i think it has something to do with evt.preventDefault() so I prevent backspace from going "back" in the browser
[20:17:39] <zg> but I believe when the preventDefault() is triggered, then you can't backspace anymore :/
[20:17:52] <zg> I think someone mentioned "events" to me before, but then I was confused and they never explained what they meant -_-
[20:18:25] <tw2113> could be worse, i could be an Opera user
[20:18:32] <tw2113> LOLZkidding, I root for you Opera
[20:18:49] <zg> I haven't even tried using Opera
[20:18:57] <tw2113> i want Opera to get 5% market share some day
[20:19:10] <zg> this app is more functional in Internet Explorer than Firefox, can you believe it
[20:19:14] <shoky> zg: don't you want .text() instead of .html()  ?
[20:19:33] <shoky> and what does $('<script>').length have to do with anything
[20:19:39] <shoky> you mean  '<script>'.length
[20:19:50] <zg> it was a test, but not the actual code I needed help with
[20:20:01] <zg> tw2113: shift+f5 and see if you can backspace >1 times
[20:20:09] <zg> cuz I refuse to install Firefox :P
[20:20:47] <tw2113> i root for Chrome last in the scheme of things
[20:20:51] <shoky> just use .text()
[20:20:58] <tw2113> google has it taken care of, no need to bother rooting
[20:21:22] <zg> shoky: done, but I'm wondering if tw2113 is still having the one-backspace issue
[20:21:27] <tw2113> yup
[20:21:30] <shoky> dont know what that issue is
[20:21:50] <tw2113> some preventDefault() shizzle
[20:21:53] <tw2113> apparently
[20:22:14] <shoky> didnt understand what the issue is ;S
[20:22:38] <tw2113> i'm not that worried about it either
[20:22:59] <tw2113> i've been bickering over making WordPress plugins translateable by default
[20:23:19] <zg> shoky: if you type <script> into the terminal
[20:23:23] <zg> you can't hit backspace
[20:23:29] <tw2113> if i type in anything
[20:23:33] <tw2113> i can't hit backspace more than 1 time
[20:23:40] <tw2113> and have it erase any characters
[20:23:49] <zg> that's something that I'm not sure what the problem is
[20:23:57] <zg> I think it has something to do with my preventDefault()
[20:24:09] <tw2113> i could type in "coldhead is on his second day" and i'd only erase that last Y
[20:24:11] <zg> is there another approach to preventing firefox from going back on keydown backspace
[20:32:23] <sheilablackrose> if i wantto set a value in a data field for a checkbox. i tried this  $('#' + data[i].Id).data('flagids', "1,2,3,4,5");   while in my html i have  <input class="wealthSubCheckBox" type="checkbox" id="<%:Model.Id %>" data-flagids=""/>. is there something wrong with the syntax?
[20:35:57] <zg> tw2113: any ideas? lol
[20:36:05] <tw2113> nope
[20:36:12] <tw2113> never had any
[20:37:20] <MiracleBlue> Derp
[20:46:13] <sheilablackrose> how can i add a class to an id?im trying to do something like  alert($('#' + data[i].Id + ' .wealthSubCheckBox').prop('checked'));
[20:46:37] <zg> $('#id').addClass('className');
[20:47:06] <zg> sheilablackrose: ^
[20:47:33] <sheilablackrose> tq
[20:47:38] <zg> np
[20:48:24] <sheilablackrose> if thats the case i can do this right  $('#' + data[i].Id).addClass('.wealthSubCheckBox').data('flagids', "1,2,3,4,5");
[20:49:30] <zg> yep

[21:05:02] <shaunoo> i dont own a website with a database
[21:06:39] <zg> shaunoo: who owns 1302.net.nz
[21:06:51] <shaunoo> must be my flatmate
[21:06:53] <zg> you're either tunnelling or connecting through them
[21:07:03] <zg> tell your flatmate he has broken links that need fixing
[21:07:15] <shaunoo> cheers
[21:07:15] <zg> that doesn't look good on the SEO end of things, if he even cares
[21:19:41] <OneBraveHog> do most phones probably have JQuery installed ? or cached ?
[21:19:50] <OneBraveHog> through normal use ?
[21:20:21] <tw2113> wouldn't "jQuery being installed" rely on the site being served?
[21:32:22] <zg> tw2113: okay WHAT THE F***
[21:32:27] <zg> look at this... http://jsfiddle.net/BgtsE/1/
[21:32:30] <zg> code REPRODUCED
[21:32:35] <zg> literally the SAME CODE
[21:33:21] <tw2113> k
[21:33:47] <zg> NEVERMIND
[21:33:51] <zg> I was testing in Chrome *facepalm*
[21:33:53] <zg> I reproduced the bug
[21:33:59] <zg> try this in firefox: http://jsfiddle.net/BgtsE/1/
[21:34:43] <tw2113> what do you think i opened it in?
[21:35:13] <zg> lol
[21:35:51] <tw2113> i like how i get this for the direction pad:  &(%'
[21:36:29] <zg> direction pad? lol
[21:36:41] <zg> your direction pad isn't using utf-8
[21:36:42] <tw2113> up, down, left, right
[21:37:38] <zg> yikes
[21:37:40] <zg> I'll look into that
[21:37:54] <zg> what are the char codes for directions? o_O
[22:16:48] <lolcat> how come thisjquery is not working
[22:16:50] <lolcat> http://jagst3r15.com/scholarships360/
[22:17:07] <lolcat> it is supposed to close the box with the latest from the blog
[22:20:28] <quijote> question for someone. I thought I had this figured out. I have a ul li ul li. I want my action to only affect the top level li and not to execute with the lower li. .stopPropagation() does not do it.
[22:23:35] <tw2113> $('ul > li') ?
[22:25:52] <quijote> what is this > thing do
[22:26:03] <quijote> trying to gooogle it
[22:26:08] <MiracleBlue> Direct descendent selector
[22:26:29] <quijote> cool
[22:30:53] <quijote> tw2113. I must be doing it wrong. It still does what I described
[22:32:34] <tw2113> isn't there some direct child method in jquery?
[22:33:04] <MiracleBlue> .children?
[22:41:05] <zg> anyone here good at .live -> .on conversion?
[22:41:39] <zg> can someone please convert this to .on() -> $('.example').live({keydown:function(e){/* blah */},keypress:function(e){/* blah */})
[22:42:07] <zg> nevermind, got it, lol
[22:46:00] <kozero> zg: i see live method in jquery v1.8.0 --> live: function( types, data, fn ) {	jQuery( this.context ).on( types, this.selector, data, fn ); return this; }
[22:46:18] <zg> live is depricated
[22:46:21] <zg> as of 1.7
[22:46:29] <zg> As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use .on() to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use .delegate() in preference to .live().
[22:47:26] <kozero> yeah
[22:48:59] <kozero> i always use on() to attach event on element
[22:50:55] <zg> ok thx
