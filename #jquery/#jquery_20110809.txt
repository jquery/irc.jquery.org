[00:00:32] <Deele> in any case, I need some nifty idea, to handle ajax based chat service in page
[00:08:25] <danheberden> Deele - i'd merge that idea with dfd.always()
[00:08:55] <danheberden> $.ajax().always( function() { /* recurse */ } );
[00:10:28] <xDROPx> anybody know a good ipad jquery overlay plugin?
[00:11:17] <danheberden> wat
[00:12:36] <gnarf> ?ajaxQueue
[00:12:37] <bot-t> jQuery.ajaxQueue - A quick demonstration of a queue for ajax calls using jQuery.Deferred() jQuery.ajax() and .queue() - http://gnarf.net/2011/06/21/jquery-ajaxqueue/
[00:12:44] <gnarf> danheberden: did you ever see that one?
[00:12:52] <gnarf> speaking of .always.... ;)
[00:13:37] <danheberden> no, i'll take a peak at it tomorrow fo sho
[00:14:04] <gnarf> it would be tiny if it wasn't for the abort method
[00:14:04] <gnarf> :)
[00:14:42] <gnarf> 323 minified
[00:20:30] <mazzachre> In JQuery Mobile How do you programatically turn on/off a fixed footer? I can see that it happens when you click the header (if it is not fixed) (clicking simply toggles the footer) But can't I do this in programming? I want the footer to disapear on scroll and apear after someone clicks a button on the page (So basically a scroll event will always hide it, and any of my buttons will show it)
[00:20:40] <Deele> gnarf, so you suggest your 1039247 gist, instead of Hynds pattern?
[00:21:28] <Stark> hai
[00:25:09] <gnarf> Deele: no, that was a tangent
[00:25:19] <gnarf> but you could easily do something like dan suggested
[00:26:18] <gnarf> i.e. function poll() { $.ajax( opts ).always( function() { setTimeout( poll, 1000 ); } ); }
[00:28:04] <Deele> gnarf, will test that
[00:28:12] <FleetFox> Hello. How can i capture form submit event and prevent it from happening?
[00:28:34] <coldhead> ?submit @ FleetFox
[00:28:35] <bot-t> FleetFox, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[00:28:40] <Deele> I would like some more realiable and less traffic heavy method, that would make server send messages to client
[00:28:41] <coldhead> ?preventdefault @ FleetFox
[00:28:42] <bot-t> FleetFox, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[00:28:52] <datarecall> looks like chrome doesnt allow window.location.hash in an onbeforeunload event, any thoughts on how to get the screen scrolled up ?
[00:29:02] <FleetFox> thanks
[00:30:03] <Cork> datarecall: window.scrollTop = 0; ?
[00:30:37] <datarecall> Cork nope just tried it
[00:31:02] <datarecall> its weird cause it will let you hide divs change backgrounds just cant get it back to the top of the page
[00:31:44] <Cork> datarecall: why do you need to scroll it back to the top?
[00:31:56] <datarecall> because im changing some of the body to give them a better deal
[00:32:12] <Cork> on unload??
[00:32:32] <datarecall> yeah because they are leaving trying to give them a better deal to get them to buy
[00:32:40] <Cork> i doubt the visitor cares about the deal if they ask to close the page
[00:32:55] <gnarf> stop harassing people
[00:33:09] <datarecall> i got it
[00:33:12] <gnarf> onbeforeunload is used for "Do you want to leave this page before saving" type notifications
[00:33:12] <Cork> gnarf: ?
[00:33:13] <datarecall> had to hide the html and bring it back
[00:33:15] <Cork> ah
[00:33:34] <datarecall> "do you want to leave because i just cut $30 off the price"
[00:33:57] <gnarf> datarecall: "fuck yeah i want to leave cuz this website wont let me close the damn page"
[00:34:04] <amit_usual> does jsonp apply only in case the cross domain server serves json data
[00:34:07] <Cork> datarecall: thats why i normally block beforeunload :D
[00:34:08] <datarecall> it only does it the once lol
[00:34:12] <Cork> i hate those nag screens
[00:34:20] <datarecall> yeah but they work
[00:34:43] <Cork> anything for a sale huh...
[00:35:15] <CalvinMcGee> I have a question
[00:35:15] <CalvinMcGee> I have a couple of div's that only has float: left, so it makes a grid. When I click on one of the divs, I want that div and the next to have clear: left, which isn't hard. But I want to animate all the divs when they move to the new positions. How to do that?
[00:35:17] <gnarf> amit_usual: hopefully it serves jsonp data
[00:36:13] <Cork> CalvinMcGee: you might be able to do it with css transision, but as its text overflow its quite close to imposible through js
[00:36:14] <gnarf> amit_usual: jsonp can transmit strings too, its a pretty simple protocol... your request passes a function name like "jQuery12341234_12312312" and the server responds with jQuery12341234_12312312( data ) - your  browser executes it like including a script
[00:37:20] <CalvinMcGee> Cork: it's really impossible?
[00:37:26] <amit_usual> gnarf : I am basically using jsonp to get rss feed from google news however the response data is not wrapped inside the callback function ... This is my initial request http://news.google.com/news?ned=us&topic=h&output=rss&callback=feed_parser&_=1312874923095
[00:37:51] <Cork> CalvinMcGee: no but you have to calculate so many variables, that it easily gets really messy
[00:38:35] <gnarf> amit_usual: thats cuz thats not a jsonp service
[00:38:39] <Cork> CalvinMcGee: and it includes faking the overflow effect with position absolute among other things
[00:38:48] <gnarf> maybe look at yql / pipes?
[00:39:43] <CalvinMcGee> Cork: another possibility i was looking at, is just animate increasing the width of the div, becuase that's the next step of the animation, but it looks tacky
[00:40:59] <Cork> CalvinMcGee: well the problems is knowing how many elements exist on that row
[00:42:25] <CalvinMcGee> Cork: so I guess no easy answer, best way is to do absolute positioning
[00:42:37] <CalvinMcGee> Cork: even though it gets messy
[00:42:42] <gnarf> inject another element before it and increase its width?
[00:43:29] <austen> So... I have an application that has a number of <divs> with rows and columns of <divs> that I "zoom" through to adjust size: position. I initially tried having all ot the child DIV elements set to relative % size and positioning, however that didn't render correctly with zooming.
[00:43:45] <CalvinMcGee> gnarf: that would work, not sure how it would look though
[00:44:17] <austen> Is there a better way than recursively calling .each() to set the display settings for all child and sibling elements in a given scope?
[00:44:40] <gnarf> austen: .find("*").hide() ?
[00:44:43] <austen> My script runs IE and Safari (and FF) to a grinding hault...
[00:45:00] <gnarf> seems kinda crazy tho
[00:45:08] <gnarf> perhaps you should paste code to explain what you actually mean
[00:45:30] <austen> Huh... The script is a zoom control, my application has a "canvas" that I want to zoom in and out of...
[00:46:24] <austen> The only thing I've come up with sofar is to not update the position/resize attributes continuously on the zoomLevel drag element, but to instead calculate these tings on the 'stop' event.
[00:46:35] <austen> But that's as far as my logic has taken me...
[00:46:51] <austen> (disclaimer: I've been awake for 40ish hours...)
[00:49:49] <gnarf> austen: are these real html elements?
[00:50:04] <austen> Yes
[00:50:17] <austen> Hold on... Code pastie is a good idea...
[00:50:36] <gnarf> there is an old trick if you use "em" for positioning you can scale the size of a single "em" using the font-size of the container
[00:52:10] <Deele> damnit, can't find where to put some js files inside java web app directory, to make them avilable "from outside", I got enough of inline codes...
[00:53:39] <seancurtis> do inline script tags which have async=true still block the page rendering?
[00:54:01] <seancurtis> or does async only apply to scripts loaded via an external source path?
[00:54:08] <austen> http://ideone.com/6Y4TQ
[00:55:07] <austen> gnarf: I had used % width and height, which appears to calculate horribly on all browsers... :)
[00:55:19] <gnarf> austen: it does ;)
[00:55:24] <gnarf> austen: try the em trick
[00:55:27] <gnarf> its pretty handy
[00:56:01] <austen> I will... I used % initially because it makes sense (not having to traverse the ENTIRE dom to zoom in and out... :)
[00:56:13] <austen> I'll give em a try and see how that fares.
[00:57:28] <austen> Of course, my assumption was that the browser rendering engine would be far superior to anything I could write in JS.... However it is a total wash when it comes to IE...
[01:00:09] <gnarf> 1em = font size
[01:00:27] <gnarf> i gotta run
[01:00:30] <gnarf> ?glwt
[01:00:31] <bot-t> Good Luck With That
[01:00:45] <Deele> 1em = current font size of current element
[01:01:11] <Deele> thats relative measurement
[01:03:59] <Defusal> hi everyone, does anyone know how i can hook all js events?
[01:07:05] <Cork> Defusal: you would have to list them all
[01:07:12] <Cork> there is no all event event :)
[01:07:26] <Defusal> Cork, then how can i get them all
[01:07:47] <Defusal> i need to find out if theres an event that fires at a certain time in an embedded browser
[01:08:03] <Cork> .bind('click mousemove keypress ...')
[01:08:11] <Cork> you have to list all events you care about
[01:09:02] <Defusal> Cork, so i must find something containing all event names, ok thanks
[01:09:20] <Cork> ?mdc events
[01:09:21] <bot-t> Cork, Events - MDN Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/Events
[01:09:30] <Cork> ?mdc dom events
[01:09:31] <bot-t> Cork, DOM event reference - MDN Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM_Events
[01:09:39] <Cork> Defusal: ^
[01:09:42] <Defusal> thanks :)
[01:10:04] <Defusal> and an embedded webkit browser wouldnt implement any custom events right?
[01:10:31] <austen> Spitting on cats.... It's as fun a game as ever!
[01:12:00] <coldhead> >: |
[01:12:42] <Cork> Defusal: they might, but thats not in that case speced events
[01:12:54] <Cork> Defusal: and then your kinda on your own :|
[01:13:22] <Defusal> also, what would the following selectors not include Cork? *, window, document
[01:13:46] <Defusal> i need to bind the events to everything possible, in hope of finding something that fires
[01:13:49] <Cork> Defusal: nothing, but it would be a duplicat selector
[01:13:55] <Cork> * means everything
[01:14:08] <Defusal> oh, so * covers those too, not only elements?
[01:14:13] <Defusal> cool
[01:14:24] <Cork> window and document is elements
[01:14:29] <Defusal> ah
[01:14:38] <iamthawlrs> Hey all, I asked about this earlier, to no avail... hoping for some guidance, to what I think is a simple issue.   I'm new to js/jquery, so the syntax is pretty foreign to me.  I'm using a pretty simple tabs script, to hide/show content.  However, I'd like one of the tabs to link to an external page.  I tried to make it work on my own, but not knowing much js... I'm kind of lost.  I commented out my attempted fix.  htt
[01:14:38] <iamthawlrs> p://pastebin.com/PgEieL9C
[01:14:46] <Cork> s/is/are/
[01:15:28] <Cork> iamthawlrs: if you instead of all that just ask for what you need help with its a lost easier to help you
[01:15:54] <Cork> iamthawlrs: as in "what your trying to do" and "what doesn't work"
[01:16:04] <Sonderblade> how can you using jquery get a list of all option values in a select element?
[01:16:27] <iamthawlrs> Okay.  Simple tabs script isn't working, when I try to link to an external page with one of the tabs.  I commented out my attempt to make it work, in the following code.  http://pastebin.com/PgEieL9C
[01:16:29] <iamthawlrs> Better.
[01:16:44] <Cork> much
[01:22:14] <austen> gnarf: Is the em trick like the % trick? If I just speficy something with em it will adjust relative to the size of it's containing document, right?
[01:24:01] <Cork> iamthawlrs: its a bit hard to see what your trying to do with out the css to get it going (and images)
[01:24:07] <Cork> iamthawlrs: do you have a live page?
[01:24:19] <iamthawlrs> http://www.whatisph.com/test/
[01:24:26] <iamthawlrs> the top left section of the main content area.
[01:27:38] <Cork> iamthawlrs: what are you trying to do with location.reaload?
[01:27:44] <Cork> don't you want to load the url?
[01:28:36] <iamthawlrs> lol... Yes.  I do.  My thinking was... when the links are clicked, it was changing the address to "/#tab-1"   So, I thought it would change the address to "shows.php" then reload, and end up on the right page.
[01:29:15] <austen> I wish there was a way to bind a specific element's attribute to an array value... So all one would have to do is update the array, and the elements would update themselves automatically...
[01:30:21] <Cork> iamthawlrs: try this http://pastebin.com/Ac5NirNE
[01:30:46] <Cork> iamthawlrs: or even better
[01:31:25] <Cork> iamthawlrs: http://pastebin.com/ydYYXr9e
[01:32:06] <iamthawlrs> @Cork:  Thank you.  Works like a champ.

[01:32:30] <iamthawlrs> I appreciate the help.
[01:33:17] <Cork> glad i could help :)
[01:33:38] <coldhead> GROUP HUG
[01:33:44] <Cork> lol
[01:33:45] * coldhead takes off her pants
[01:34:02] * iamthawlrs rejoices.
[01:34:31] <austen> Internet Explorer is hopeless. I don't care whcih version you rape me with, they're all broken...
[01:35:08] <Puck`> austen: psstt, coldhead took off her pants, no one is paying attention to you
[01:35:08] <Cork> austen: well its become better at least
[01:35:16] <Cork> lol
[01:35:17] <gnarf> austen: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/ARq4z/
[01:35:19] <austen> *accept group hug. Get another beer. Grab another smoke on the balcony.
[01:36:31] <austen> Puck`: I'm queer as a three dollar bill, so I could care less about coldhead's pants...
[01:36:40] <Eddie303> hello, please, someone could help me out passing a parameter to a callback function? I mean can I do something like that? http://pastebin.com/nb6HQwRu
[01:37:07] <Puck`> austen: well I hoped so, I'd be a bit scared if someone would rejoice if someone is throwing her/his virtual pants on and off
[01:37:40] <austen> *I did that earlier this evening.... Nothign special...
[01:38:16] <austen> gnarf: AWESOME!!! I think that may reduce my recursive function calls to a big fat ZERO!!
[01:39:00] <Nikro> hey guys, I have ie7 issue with a file field .change() event, (jquery 1.3.2) for some freaking reason .bind('*', function() {} ) works fine in ie7, how can that be explained? :))
[01:39:30] <gnarf> austen: yeah, its a clever trick
[01:39:35] <gnarf> its kinda hard to maintain the math
[01:39:36] <austen> @Puck`: Yes... Virtual pants are never the same as actual pants, sex of pant wearer or not...
[01:39:38] <gnarf> but it works well
[01:40:12] <austen> @gnarf: the math? Ok... Open new tab time. :)
[01:40:29] <austen> I'm glad I learned "math" early
[01:40:39] <gnarf> austen: meaning like if you are changing the positions programmatically as well
[01:40:42] <austen> I mean that literally, btw
[01:40:45] <gnarf> dunno if you are gonna allow dragging or whatever
[01:40:48] <phpcoderneeded> hello
[01:41:06] <austen> Yes, I am... The elements are draggable
[01:41:11] <phpcoderneeded> i need coder to make me a website and get payed
[01:41:16] <austen> gnarf^^^
[01:41:23] <gnarf> just be sure to set it back to em values after you drag em
[01:41:43] <phpcoderneeded> just contact me
[01:41:47] <austen> @phpcoderneeded whell what do you need?
[01:41:52] <Puck`> phpcoderneeded: if you need to get laid you also go out and shout in the world that you need a woman to get laid and you'll pay?
[01:42:12] <phpcoderneeded> will sounds nice
[01:42:13] <phpcoderneeded> lol
[01:42:41] <phpcoderneeded> i want to take it in private so if any one intressted plz send me pm
[01:42:45] <austen> *woman??
[01:43:09] <gnarf> phpcoderneeded: doubtful that non-existant project description will get anyone in here to pm
[01:43:42] <austen> Right after I pm'd
[01:43:50] <austen> I'm that desperate for work...
[01:44:51] <phpcoderneeded> will people come here in search of help
[01:44:55] <phpcoderneeded> then why not
[01:44:57] <phpcoderneeded> huh
[01:45:12] <gnarf> phpcoderneeded: might have something to do with the "php" part in the #jquery channel ?
[01:47:33] <phpcoderneeded> will i couldnt find #php
[01:47:36] <phpcoderneeded> :(
[01:47:44] <DonBurks> ....on this server.
[01:47:48] <phpcoderneeded> yea
[01:48:04] <phpcoderneeded> plz tell me if there is a channel for php
[01:48:17] <Eddie303> phpcoderneeded: ##php
[01:48:51] <ravenzz> phpcoderneeded you must have a registered nick, to join that channel
[01:49:16] <gnarf> i think #weblance has been recommended before for people looking to hire people
[01:49:21] <gnarf> but i dunno if that was it
[01:52:55] <phpcoderneeded> there is no channel as weblance i checked
[01:53:16] <wangdoo> check this http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/31/ when,i press enter key,it adds inputted tags but why it is moving forward
[01:53:32] <phpcoderneeded> but making a website with jquery is also ok
[01:53:34] <Fox`> does resize() fire simultaneously?
[01:53:44] <phpcoderneeded> if any one here is skilled coder
[01:54:11] <Fox`> for example if i were to just resize the window, would resize fire before the previous fire has finished?
[01:55:11] <Cork> Fox`: it fires every time the browser gets the size event from the os
[01:55:18] <gnarf> Fox`: no, there is only one thread for javascript execution
[01:56:21] <Cork> gnarf: depends on the number of events, each even block will complete, but not agaranteed that all events will
[01:56:57] <wangdoo> gnarf: check this http://jsfiddle.net/Pjcwf/31/ when,i press enter key,it adds inputted tags but why it is moving forward
[01:57:11] <gnarf> wangdoo: no
[01:57:11] <Fox`> mm
[01:57:35] <gnarf> wangdoo: i'm not in the habit of supporting someone elses plugin
[01:57:41] <gnarf> unless its a plugin i've used
[01:58:14] <callumacrae> How do I completely remove a DOM element using jQuery?
[01:58:22] <Fox`> maybe this is what i'm talking about? http://noteslog.com/post/how-to-fix-the-resize-event-in-ie/
[01:58:39] <wangdoo> gnarf:  OKAY.
[01:58:48] <callumacrae> $('#id').remove();$('#id').length still returns 1
[01:59:40] <gnarf> callumacrae: .remove() removes it from the DOM
[02:00:09] <wangdoo> gnarf: can you check once and find where m wrong?
[02:00:21] <aro> i am having some problems with my page; i am using hoverintent with a modified superfish menu: http://www.chapmanfamilyalbum.com/pfl
[02:00:38] <aro> when you hover over 'adopt' it expands and then retracts as soon as it is done animating
[02:00:41] <aro> and i cannot figure out why
[02:00:46] <callumacrae> gnarf: Then why is it still here?
[02:00:55] <gnarf> callumacrae: see ?p
[02:00:55] <bot-t> callumacrae, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:02:11] <callumacrae> Oh, it's not in the DOM tree, but it is still returned by $('#id')
[02:02:22] <callumacrae> And I'm just typing stuff into the console atm
[02:02:28] <gnarf> it shouldn't
[02:02:29] <wangdoo> gnarf:  have you seen it?
[02:02:47] <gnarf> wangdoo: are you still using that .tagify()
[02:02:58] <wangdoo> gnarf: yes
[02:03:22] <wangdoo> gnarf:  I'm new to jquery.to simply my task,m using it
[02:03:25] <gnarf> then yes, i've seen it
[02:03:57] <wangdoo> gnarf: why text box is moving forward
[02:04:07] <gnarf> wangdoo: you tell me?
[02:04:25] <wangdoo> gnarf: I do not know,that is reason of asking you
[02:05:02] <gnarf> wangdoo: try figuring it out...
[02:05:12] <gnarf> don't give up and >pester< people
[02:05:29] <gnarf> we could maybe help if you told us what it wasn't
[02:06:16] <gnarf> wangdoo: i've seen you asking basically the same question for like 2 days it feels like
[02:06:44] <gnarf> and the fact that you see me helping someone else is not an invitation for you to adress your concerns to me, i am helping those other people because i actually know how to help them with the problem, or have a thought
[02:06:50] <gnarf> i can't even figure out what you're asking
[02:06:52] <wangdoo> gnarf: I'm unable to figure it out
[02:07:15] <quicksilver> wangdoo: then abandon programming, and take up another career more suited to your abilities.

[02:09:48] <quicksilver> wangdoo: I have a job to do - for which I get paid - and helping you is not it.
[02:11:04] <DonBurks> Lather. Rinse. Repeat.
[02:13:04] <aro> anyone familiar with hoverintent? I suspect i am using it incorrectly, i just cant figure out why it is firing the off state straight away
[02:13:16] <gnarf> ?p @aro
[02:13:17] <bot-t> aro, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:15:18] <aro> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/455166/
[02:15:26] <aro> it wouldnt let me paste at jsfiddle for some reason
[02:15:38] <aro> line 43 is where hoverintent is invoked
[02:17:28] <gnarf> aro: seems correct
[02:18:15] <aro> http://www.chapmanfamilyalbum.com/pfl
[02:18:27] <aro> thats it being used on 'adopt'
[02:19:49] <gnarf> aro: i dont have a ton of time to dig in right now
[02:19:54] <aro> ok no worries
[02:20:00] <gnarf> aro: i shoulda been in bed like 1+ hr ago
[02:20:13] <mfilipe> hi guys, I have a question about selectors. how do I do to get the object with class "sub-menu" that in nav tag? jQuery('nav .sub-menu')
[02:20:16] <gnarf> im just kinda camping out to see if wangdoo tries coming back under a different name
[02:20:25] <aro> :)
[02:20:48] <aro> mfilipe: what do you mean?
[02:21:19] <gnarf> mfilipe: that is correct, it will find any items with the class "sub-menu" in the <nav>
[02:21:41] <mfilipe> <nav id="access"><ul class="sub-menu">...<ul class="sub-menu">...</nav>
[02:21:48] <mfilipe> I want get all sub-menu items
[02:21:54] <gnarf> the li
[02:21:58] <gnarf> or the ul?
[02:22:10] <mfilipe> ul
[02:22:13] <mfilipe> with many li
[02:22:22] <gnarf> then yeah, you're selecting the ul
[02:22:33] <mfilipe> :)
[02:22:47] <aro> $('ul.sub-menu li')

[02:31:24] <luucasw> Hi, im using the content slider called coda, and i just wonder if others have had the same issue with that after the slider has been ongoing for a while in my browser, it suddenly stops to stop on each slide and just go back and forth on my slides without a pause?
[02:39:16] <aro> 			$('li:has(ul)',this)[($.fn.hoverIntent && !o.disableHI) ? 'hoverIntent' : 'hover'](over,out).each(function() { } - what is this line doing?
[02:39:48] <aro> i havent seen the $(selector)[ ( logic here )]() method before
[02:41:31] <blackspotwiggins> aro, it allows you to select properties from variables
[02:41:43] <Sonderblade> how can you add options to a select element only if the option is not already present in the list?
[02:42:01] <blackspotwiggins> if you had var a = { b : 123 } and var key = "b";
[02:42:19] <blackspotwiggins> you could do a[key], but not a.key
[02:42:59] <Cork> Sonderblade: var select = $('selector') select.find('[value="<your pref>"]').length < 1
[02:43:39] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: select element not object ;)
[02:44:04] <blackspotwiggins> Cork, ?
[02:45:15] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: i might have missunderstood, so, nm '>_>
[02:45:37] <aro> hey i got it
[02:45:40] <aro> cool
[02:46:04] <aro> is there a way to extend hoverintent onto another element? so that my slider doesnt close when i mouse off of the menu?
[02:52:02] <nir0> guys, hopw do i pause some script?
[02:52:22] <nir0> on tab switch
[02:52:29] <nir0> in firefox
[02:52:37] <nir0> or window unfocus
[02:52:47] <quicksilver> use the 'blur' handler on the window object afaik
[02:52:59] <quicksilver> $(window).blur(function() { ... });
[02:53:27] <quicksilver> but remember that javascript in browsers runs in a single thread so no event handlers will fire if you actually have javascript running.
[02:55:31] <RubyTN> I have the following code:  everything works except for the fact that I am not able to remove the br elements when the div is removed, so I am left with blank space in the page.  How can I also remove the br elements?
[02:55:43] <nir0> quicksilver: i got a carousel which needs to be paused
[02:55:50] <RubyTN> here is the fiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/qkA4j/9/
[02:56:49] <quicksilver> nir0: well, let's hope your carousel object has some kind of 'pause' or 'stop' function you can call then! :)
[02:57:26] <nir0> quicksilver: i think i need to throw it away and write a new one...
[02:58:26] <gnarf> ?#9381 @nir0
[02:58:28] <bot-t> nir0, [#9381] animations halt when the browser is out of focus due to requestAnimationFrame (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9381
[02:58:31] <gnarf> read the comments on that
[02:58:46] <gnarf> there is some helpful stuff in there for dealing with that issue
[02:59:26] <RubyTN> any ideas?
[02:59:46] <nir0> gnarf: just the same bug as i do have
[03:01:18] <gnarf> nir0: yeah, i talk about the "right way" to solve it
[03:01:38] <gnarf> which is not queueing animations via a setInterval/setTimeout loop - use the callback of the animation to queue the next instead
[03:01:41] <nir0> gnarf: thanks a lot
[03:01:48] <gnarf> just read the comments
[03:01:55] <gnarf> also i think rick linked a way to do it
[03:01:58] <nir0> yeah i m readin
[03:03:29] <sean`> HOLABOLA
[03:03:36] <RubyTN> should this var filebr = $(this).closest('.files br')     &&   filebr.remove(); work to remove the br that occurs after a div?  this is an onclick event btw
[03:04:14] <Skizu> Good morning
[03:05:50] <RubyTN> Deele:  I have a quick question about the code you created for me a little earlier.  There are breaks after each div that is being created.  How can I also remove those breaks?  here is a fiddle about what I am talking about:  http://jsfiddle.net/qkA4j/9/
[03:07:19] <nir0> gnarf: so, there's a patch for it?
[03:10:49] <gnarf> nir0: not yet
[03:10:59] <gnarf> nir0: we are still deciding how to solve it
[03:11:01] <johnathanb> Anyone know why I don't have access to this url variable outside .change?
[03:11:02] <johnathanb> http://pastie.org/2344188
[03:11:12] <gnarf> nir0: best bet is to not do the behavior that causes the issue
[03:11:28] <gnarf> i.e. use your animation complete callbacks to queue the next anim rather than a setTimeout loop
[03:11:47] <dabear> johnathanb: the url gets set only when a change event occur
[03:12:04] <dabear> that console.log happens before the change event occurs
[03:12:36] <johnathanb> dabear: Ohh, is there an easy way to fix that?
[03:12:47] <dabear> johnathanb: yes, fix your logic
[03:13:04] <dabear> ie. you need to understand what is happening
[03:13:24] <johnathanb> You know, I really don't think I'd be here if I di understand. Cunt.
[03:13:49] <dabear> if you need to run the "url =.." onchange, you cannot log the variable before that change has happened
[03:13:58] <gnarf> nir0: the other option that someone pointed out was using the windows focus/blur and just setting $.fx.off
[03:14:08] <dabear> either move the url setting part, or move the console.log part into the change event
[03:19:03] <aro> is there a way to return true if the mouse is over a certain element
[03:19:57] <mattalexx> What's a selector that says "Give me all IMG tags that have a nonempty alt attribute?"
[03:25:25] <RubyTN> dabear:  I have a .remove to delete a div onclick, I however need to remove the <br> after each div.  How can I also remove those breaks?  here is a fiddle about what I am talking about:  http://jsfiddle.net/qkA4j/9/
[03:25:45] <dabear> hm?
[03:27:27] <dabear> mattalexx: $("img[alt]") is the closest you get. you can however use .filter
[03:28:19] <dabear> $("img[alt]").filter( function(){ return this.alt.length;})
[03:32:15] <mattalexx> daThanks, I appreciate the help

[03:52:01] <Fox`> bare with my vagueness, but i've built an ajax chat system and would like to convert it to use a <something> connection so i dont have to constantly poll the server. what is that something?
[03:53:40] <Sonderblade> Fox`: Comet
[03:53:44] <dabear> Fox`: websockets, but implementation is poor
[03:53:52] <Fox`> oh
[03:54:01] <Fox`> you mean jquery's?
[03:54:17] <dabear> no
[03:54:20] <dabear> browser's
[03:54:25] <AdTaylor> Can I pick someones brains about JSLint? Cos it keeps calling me a dick… and I'm starting to believe it
[03:54:35] <dabear> jquery does not encapsualte websockets at all
[03:54:47] <dabear> AdTaylor: use jshint instead
[03:55:06] <Fox`> yeh i'm looking at a plugin. is there nothing else i could use then?
[03:56:23] <AdTaylor> dabear : nice one, thanks
[03:56:23] <RubyTN> how can I remove a br after a div that has a set ID
[03:57:26] <dabear> RubyTN: define "after"
[03:57:26] <Fox`> actually it depends on which browsers don't support it
[03:57:36] <dabear> and RubyTN, see ?next
[03:57:37] <bot-t> .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[03:58:09] <Deele> RubyTN, $(id).next('br') or .closest('br')
[03:58:34] <RubyTN> here is the fiddle of what I am trying to do:  http://jsfiddle.net/qkA4j/9/
[03:59:26] <tootiredtosleep> anyone any ideas?
[03:59:48] <Fox`> oh firefox has it disabled by default and chrome may do the same :*
[03:59:49] <Fox`> :(
[04:00:32] <Deele> RubyTN, I would suggest removing those BR's for a whole container, right after content generation, BR are used to seperate lines inside text paragraph, nothing more...
[04:01:31] <RubyTN> Deele:  problem is, all of my rows just get jumbled up if I don't
[04:01:44] <Deele> RubyTN, use CSS :doh:
[04:02:39] <RubyTN> I can do that, but inline is the only thing that gives me the look I want.  Block has too much space inbetween the lines
[04:02:53] <RubyTN> Deele:  I can do that, but inline is the only thing that gives me the look I want.  Block has too much space inbetween the lines
[04:03:12] <Deele> RubyTN, then use block or inline-block, set margins/paddings the way you need
[04:03:41] <Deele> RubyTN, that is what CSS for, dont use BR'akes for content positioning
[04:04:36] <tootiredtosleep> can anyone suggest how to go about: I have images that I need to label specific areas, preferably highlight as well. images may be huge so zooming may be neccessary. ideas on how to approach this?
[04:06:41] <Fox`> ok i can use socket.io
[04:09:26] <RubyTN> Deele:  with display:block;margin:0;padding;0; I still can't get rid of the breaks block creates.  Any ideas?
[04:09:55] <Sonderblade> tootiredtosleep: sounds like image maps would work
[04:10:03] <AdTaylor> is there a way to write 'return this.var = obj;' and it be valid (as in it works in chrome but JSHint doesn't like it)
[04:11:35] <Sonderblade> AdTaylor: hopefully not, assignments shouldn't be mixed with other statements
[04:12:16] <dabear> AdTaylor: function bar(b){ return (this.a = b);}
[04:12:19] <tootiredtosleep> is there a clean way of adding them via mouse, I found a a few examples but they produced less than usable results.
[04:12:54] <tootiredtosleep> and I'm not too sure on how to implement image maps with zooming functionality.
[04:16:18] <AdTaylor> thanks

[04:23:14] <aro> is there a way to extend hoverintent onto another element? so that my slider doesnt close when i mouse off of the menu?
[04:23:24] <aro> is there a way to return true if the mouse is over a certain element
[04:32:57] <AdTaylor> sorry, I have another question about valid syntax … JSHint flags this up as already defined…  dateString = dateString.split('/');
[04:33:08] <AdTaylor> should this not be used either
[04:33:35] <dabear> aro: check this: http://jsfiddle.net/WhHLC/2/
[04:37:19] <dabear> AdTaylor: depends on the situation. cannot tell without seeing the sorrounding code
[04:39:11] <AdTaylor> if you have time, the function is here http://jsfiddle.net/Zu6XG/1/
[04:40:51] <dabear> AdTaylor: yep, that is incorrect. there is an implicit var dateString = undefined there
[04:41:04] <dabear> as dateString comes from the first parameter
[04:42:14] <AdTaylor> ah crap yeah, I see. Makes total sense. Thanks for looking
[04:42:25] <dabear> http://jsfiddle.net/Zu6XG/1/
[04:43:27] <dabear> http://jsfiddle.net/Zu6XG/2/

[05:45:51] <seutje> Sergejack: should u be substracting if u want the position relative to an element?
[05:46:11] <seutje> ah boo, fucker left
[05:46:42] <aro> specifically: expr.replace is not a function at line 4515 in jquery 1.5.1
[05:47:43] <seutje> aaah, why is thickbox still referenced at http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Mouse_Position ?
[05:48:17] <Cork> aro: thats most likly a prob with your selecton

[05:48:58] <aro> thats what i have thats triggering the error
[05:49:02] <Cork> aro: when jquery throws errors in the lib, most of the time its cause wrong type of data is passed
[05:49:43] <Cork> aro: what exact line?
[05:50:02] <Cork> is it the mose over event or without it?
[05:50:06] <aro> well thats the problem, i dont know.. it just says that jquery throws an erroron line 4543 on 1.5.2
[05:50:08] <Cork> *mousemove
[05:50:12] <aro> mouseover
[05:50:20] <Cork> even :)

[05:50:47] <luke_66> hi everyone. i'm absolutely a newbie w/ jquery. i'm trying to use jstree: i pass to jstree instance this JSON encoded structure (this is the dump of Zend Debug): http://pastebin.com/uwnWtwma.  this is instead the creation of tree instance: http://pastebin.com/HejtSGHc. now i can i access to children metadata?
[05:50:54] <aro> when i debug expr in jquery.js, it is ':hidden'
[05:53:02] <aro> it is when i mouseover
[05:53:07] <aro> thats when the error is thrown

[05:58:07] <Cork> luke_66: json has fundamentally very little to do with jquery
[05:58:46] <Cork> luke_66: the data you get there should be a normal data object and all you need to do is treat it as compilation of arrays and objects
[05:59:24] <Cork> luke_66: whats the content of "data" ?
[05:59:38] <Cork> (in the select_node.jstree callback)
[05:59:49] <luke_66> Cork: the encoded JSON array of objects
[05:59:59] <Cork> the full array?
[06:00:08] <luke_66> Cork: yes
[06:00:18] <Cork> do you have the array index somwhere?

[06:06:55] <Cork> aro: validate your js
[06:07:07] <aro> it is valid
[06:07:11] <Cork> you prob have a syntax error or sending the wrong data to a selecto somewhere
[06:07:20] <Cork> *selection
[06:07:44] <Cork> to my experience that has always been the cause of those type or errors

[06:09:49] <Cork> you have a link?
[06:11:04] <wesada> I have a form with an autocomplete which gets it's data from a remote source.  In this form I clone elements to allow a user to enter more than one item at a time.  How can I get the autocomplete to show up on subsequent  input items once cloned?

[06:12:03] <aro> if you run this from the console: $('#spDrawer').isHovered();

[06:12:48] <Cork> nope
[06:12:57] <Cork> "[div#spDrawer.drawer]"
[06:13:09] <aro> do i need to pass that to it?

[06:13:25] <Cork> no thats what i returns
[06:13:31] <aro> oh
[06:13:34] <Cork> [div#spDrawer.drawer] ; false

[06:15:18] <dabear> omg
[06:15:33] <dabear> you don't realize console.log must be available?
[06:15:37] <dabear> hm
[06:15:54] <mc_plectrum> i have a condition which includes  $object.children().size() > 0 , which is evaluated to true, but if i output $object.children().size() > 0 in the console if this branch is taken, the result is false
[06:15:56] <aro> erm.. what?
[06:16:14] <dabear> mc_plectrum: branch? huh
[06:17:00] <AdTaylor> aro - you are querying something that you havent assigned as suckerpunch
[06:17:14] <JakeyChan> how to select element with id that is xxx-{digit} like xxx-1, xxx-2, xxx-3
[06:17:33] <aro> AdTaylor: does it need to be? it is outside of that scope
[06:17:36] <mc_plectrum> dabear:  if($object.children().size() > 0 && ...){  now in console $object.children().size() > 0 is evaluated to false...}
[06:17:45] <tootiredtosleep> hey guys whats the best way going about taking an image, using maps to label stuff, and being able to zoom in/out
[06:17:46] <dabear> JakeyChan: don't do it. it would be SLOW
[06:17:57] <Sonderblade> what jquery tabs plugin do you prefer?
[06:18:21] <dabear> mc_plectrum: is $object in the script and the console the very exacy same ?
[06:18:31] <dabear> my guess it not?
[06:18:50] <AdTaylor> aro - yes,  $('#navmenu li').isHovered() works
[06:19:21] <aro> hm.. so what should i do to make this work?
[06:19:29] <Eviltwin> JakeyChan: Start with $("[id^=xxx-]") ?
[06:19:36] <mc_plectrum> dabear: yes it is... i am using reverse() and afterwards my functions seem to work on wrong objects...
[06:19:39] <aro> what i am trying to do is prevent the drawer from retracting when you mouse over it (since it is technically a sibling of the menu)
[06:19:59] <dabear> Eviltwin: DONT DO IT
[06:20:06] <dabear> it is shit slow
[06:20:21] <dabear> $("[id^=xxx-]") is the same as $("*[id^=xxx-]")
[06:20:26] <Eviltwin> dabear: Aware
[06:20:30] <Eviltwin> But for his problem what's going to be faster?
[06:20:31] <dabear> which basically says select all elements
[06:20:50] <dabear> for his problem, he should consider using classes
[06:21:29] <dabear> Eviltwin: the problem isn't that you know, but when you provide code to people, *they* have to understand what implications it has
[06:21:44] <malinens> I have 2 input fields and one selectbox. if I add the same class name to all three elements, will $(".someclass").change event check all three elements for change event?
[06:22:06] <aro> AdTaylor: how do i make that apply to the 'drawer' ?
[06:23:08] <dabear> malinens: yes, given that the selector is run after you apply those class names
[06:23:12] <meek> Hi. How can I make all my buttons (and possibly other stuff, like forms, etc.) use the jquery-ui theme?
[06:23:33] <malinens> dabear: thanks!
[06:23:51] <AdTaylor> aro - I don't understand what you are trying to achieve
[06:24:16] <dabear> malinens: but no if you apply the class after you have defined your change event handler
[06:24:32] <aro> AdTaylor: there is a navmenu on the green bar, then when it is hovered, the purple tray slides out - i want to prevent the tray from retracting when you 'mouseove' the tray
[06:24:42] <aro> because hoverintent wants to close it when you leave the menu
[06:24:53] <malinens> I'll just add addClass at the beginning of document.ready
[06:25:14] <malinens> Will it work for example if I use "live"?
[06:25:45] <malinens> http://api.jquery.com/live/ and If class defined later...
[06:26:07] <Cork> aro: check so its not something in your browser
[06:26:27] <dabear> typ
[06:26:30] <dabear> yup
[06:26:38] <malinens> ok
[06:27:01] <AdTaylor> aro - could you not just disable hoverintent? Or is it needed?
[06:27:16] <aro> i would prefer to use it, but i could disable it i suppose
[06:35:18] <aro> AdTaylor: im having a hard time getting it to function without HI
[06:36:32] <AdTaylor> aro — I'm not sure that plugin is the best solution to your problem… which is essentially a simple one
[06:37:34] <blackspotwiggins> aro, make the elements you need to give hovered children of the element that triggers the hover
[06:38:09] <blackspotwiggins> otherwise you need to set/unset flags and check them when you handle mouseleave
[06:42:11] <aro> AdTaylor: i wrote it as a spinoff another
[06:42:20] <hariom> I am opening a window using window.open(url, "", features); It is possible that the user opens up another window while the first one is still open. How to not allow and bring the first window in focus if some one create a new window?
[06:42:32] <aro> blackspotwiggins: thats hard to do, because of the way i have the elements positioned
[06:42:43] <aro> it needs to appear BEHIND the parent(s)
[06:43:08] <blackspotwiggins> if its behind the parent, how can you hover to it ?
[06:43:19] <aro> it slides out from behind the parent
[06:43:32] <blackspotwiggins> now you are just contradicting
[06:43:37] <aro> how so?
[06:44:07] <tootiredtosleep> anyone know how i can draw an map area using js?
[06:44:49] <hariom> Is it possible to detect if a window is already opened using window.open() to make sure that extra windows don't open up.
[06:45:02] <aro> hariom: yes
[06:45:15] <hariom> aro: kindly guide how?
[06:45:25] <silv3r_m00n> anything wrong with this $('body') ?
[06:45:39] <Cork> silv3r_m00n: nope
[06:45:52] <Brodingo> every body is special
[06:46:00] <Brodingo> dont let anyone tell you there is anything wrong with yours
[06:46:01] <Cork> $(document.body) does the same, and might be a slightly bit faster, thats about it
[06:46:06] <tootiredtosleep> lies.
[06:46:24] <silv3r_m00n> ok
[06:46:35] <aro> var windowid = window.open();
[06:46:35] <Paveloosha> <hariom>, name a window..
[06:46:50] <aro> then windowid.focus(); windowid.close(); etc
[06:46:55] <aro> if (windowid) {}
[06:47:01] <aro> and so forth
[06:48:51] <hariom> aro, Paveloosha: thanks. Trying it out.
[06:51:04] <ccmonster> hola kids
[06:51:42] <aro> blackspotwiggins: did you figure out how i was contradicting?
[06:52:26] <blackspotwiggins> how can something be behind another object, when it slides out from behind it
[06:52:56] <blackspotwiggins> do you have a demo or smth?
[06:54:37] <aro> www.chapmanfamilyalbum.com/pfl
[06:55:22] <hariom> aro, Paveloosha: It has worked. Thank you.
[06:55:28] <aro> most welcome
[06:56:52] <poppiez> isn't jquery compatible with google's closure compiler in advanced mode?
[06:56:57] <poppiez> can't get my extern to work
[06:58:53] <ccmonster> i belive it is.
[06:58:57] <aro> blackspotwiggins: refresh the page and hover over 'adopt' and you will see the menu pop out
[06:58:59] <ccmonster> anyone here used ben almans bbq?
[07:00:26] <blackspotwiggins> aro, seems like a trivial problem
[07:00:38] <aro> i sure hope so :)
[07:01:08] <aro> i just want it to stay stuck out if you mouse over the panel that comes out
[07:01:09] <blackspotwiggins> mouseenter -> set class; mouseleave -> remove class when not hovering lower part
[07:01:19] <blackspotwiggins> it toggles twice right now btw
[07:01:27] <luke_66> Cork: solved: setted 'href' attribute in 'attr' array (inside 'data' array) in the json structure. then retrieved in 'select_node.jstree' function by  data.rslt.obj.children("a:eq(0)").attr("href"), and finally redirect  the entire window with window.location.href. not really stylish, but it works...tnx anyway
[07:01:50] <aro> hmm ok
[07:02:25] <blackspotwiggins> use css3 to create animations
[07:02:27] <blackspotwiggins> and you're set
[07:02:45] <b-lew> anyone know how this website loads? is it a plugin? I'd love to learn how to do this. http://www.invisiblecreature.com/work/
[07:03:23] <blackspotwiggins> b-lew, probably hard custom work
[07:03:26] <blackspotwiggins> not everything is a plugin
[07:04:00] <b-lew> blackspotwiggins: I understand that. its really nice! I want to try to do it. not for sure where to start though
[07:04:51] <ccmonster> the way it goes through the image loading?
[07:05:12] <blackspotwiggins> b-lew, animations, either through css3 or animate()
[07:05:18] <b-lew> yea image and content
[07:05:26] <blackspotwiggins> coupled with watching scroll position
[07:05:37] <ccmonster> that and ther eis a ton of flexbox on that site i believe
[07:05:51] <blackspotwiggins> seems like js based animation mostly
[07:06:36] <b-lew> yea, I'd agree. there deploy.js is crazy compressed
[07:07:14] <blackspotwiggins> you can pretty print it
[07:07:55] <blackspotwiggins> neat, looks like svg based stuff
[07:08:08] <b-lew> svg?
[07:08:43] <ccmonster> yea. theres svg, and they use the hashchange for all the history
[07:08:47] <ccmonster> notice the url hack /#/
[07:09:18] <b-lew> oh Thats where I get lost. I'm not that advanced.
[07:09:23] <ccmonster> ton of flexbox in there though. Tons.
[07:09:29] <b-lew> hence why I was hoping for a plugin haha
[07:10:03] <ccmonster> if you ajax all your content in then there is no way for the use to simply hit the back button and go to the last point.
[07:10:18] <blackspotwiggins> their back button is borked
[07:10:36] <ccmonster> however, using a #, or hash, like what you get when you use an anchor tag, the browser DOES recognize.
[07:10:40] <b-lew> isn't that cool though?
[07:11:16] <ccmonster> So to get the functionality of ajax'd content + allow users to use their back and forward buttons, developers manipulate the onhashchange event
[07:11:32] <blackspotwiggins> dont see no flexbox tho
[07:11:34] <ccmonster> the /#/ is a way of hacking the hash change and getting a directory like URL + a hash in one
[07:11:51] <ccmonster> look in the HTML tag blackspotwiggins
[07:12:06] <blackspotwiggins> thats modernizr detection
[07:12:11] <ccmonster> the flexbox class is ?
[07:12:30] <blackspotwiggins> if you looked with ie6 there would be no-flexbox
[07:12:48] <ccmonster> whats the flexbox class for in this case then?
[07:13:04] <blackspotwiggins> i just told you. its modernizr detection
[07:13:18] <blackspotwiggins> i was wrong about svg tho, seems like regular clip css
[07:15:05] <b-lew> that would probably take quite awhile to make
[07:15:14] <ccmonster> I guess I'm thrown off my bodernizr throwing that class in there. I've only dabbled with modernizr, but plan on using it for this next major deploy
[07:15:19] <b-lew> I don't think I'm advanced enough to do so
[07:15:33] <ccmonster> It's a pretty well done site, all told.
[07:15:40] <blackspotwiggins> ccmonster, it's pretty useful
[07:15:52] <blackspotwiggins> if you want progressive enhancement/nice degrading
[07:15:57] <ccmonster> Yea. I'd say so, from what I understand.
[07:16:21] <ccmonster> I'm looking at using html5 boilerplate. Pauly has a nice package there and I'm anxious to see it action for myself.
[07:16:34] <b-lew> I'm using… http://html5boilerplate.com/
[07:16:36] <b-lew> i like it
[07:16:53] <blackspotwiggins> yea it's a nice base
[07:17:07] <blackspotwiggins> you should look into it and choose the things you need
[07:17:18] <blackspotwiggins> just blindly using everything might get you in trouble
[07:17:26] <blackspotwiggins> .. as it is with most things
[07:17:26] <ccmonster> Yea. I've done some test deploys with it. I will probably use the custom, and go with aggresive settings on it.
[07:17:31] <ccmonster> yes, indeed.
[07:18:25] <poppiez> has anyone used closure compiler med ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS with jquery 1.6.2?
[07:18:35] <poppiez> s/med/with
[07:19:08] <poppiez> I'm using this extern: http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/svn-history/r1152/trunk/contrib/externs/jquery-1.6.js
[07:19:25] <ccmonster> blackspotwiggins, you used bbq plugin, or anything like it for history.
[07:19:34] <ccmonster> im looking to do the hashchange history, but its being funky with that plugin.
[07:19:44] <blackspotwiggins> ccmonster, hashchange is old stuff
[07:19:50] <blackspotwiggins> go with html5 pushstate
[07:20:18] <blackspotwiggins> i created my own solution tho
[07:20:26] <blackspotwiggins> existing plugins were too inflexible/bloated
[07:20:37] <ccmonster> but i need to handle older browsers as well. Will that work?
[07:20:51] <blackspotwiggins> it degrades to regular links
[07:21:03] <ccmonster> hmm.
[07:21:25] <blackspotwiggins> read up on why hashbangs are bad for the internets
[07:21:46] <ccmonster> i hate hashes, but feel like it's a neccessary evil in this situation
[07:22:33] <blackspotwiggins> why ?
[07:22:44] <ccmonster> which part are you asking why about?
[07:22:50] <blackspotwiggins> why is it necessary?
[07:23:05] <blackspotwiggins> the only real reason for ajax navigation is speed right?
[07:23:19] <blackspotwiggins> but old browsers with no pushstate are slow anyway
[07:23:36] <blackspotwiggins> if you like breaking your site and internet for ie7 peasants, go right ahead
[07:23:50] <ccmonster> its ff 3.6 peasants in this case :|
[07:23:55] <b1lly> is there a way to check the"data" within the function(data) { } from a post method to see if theres anything? it seems to always return true no matter if theres a any data or no
[07:24:08] <ccmonster> log that ish' out.
[07:24:16] <keyword> hi gusy I have a doubt how can I convert <a href="url">title</a> to "url" I need convert the link to text
[07:24:27] <luke_66> how can i use the 'initially_open' config option to specify which nodes is selected on tree load?
[07:24:57] <blackspotwiggins> ccmonster, fx users are usually upgrading pretty fast anyway
[07:25:29] <ccmonster> well, they are supporting 3.6 folks because of a extension that hasnt been upgraded, so I am temporarily at their mercy
[07:26:14] <ccmonster> then again, I could save some serious pain, and just say this milestone release doesn't come out until ff 4.0 is supported by out extension, then call it a day lol
[07:26:30] <ccmonster> keyword, you just want the href attribute?
[07:26:33] <blackspotwiggins> or
[07:26:42] <blackspotwiggins> let fx3.6 users get regular navigation
[07:26:44] <blackspotwiggins> and all is well
[07:26:56] <blackspotwiggins> and if you srsly have to support 3.6
[07:27:00] <blackspotwiggins> which is now 2 years old
[07:27:01] <keyword> ccmonster:  yeaps
[07:27:08] <blackspotwiggins> or was it 1.5
[07:27:16] <ccmonster> $('a').attr('href')
[07:27:26] <keyword> ccmonster:  yeap but I have this as string
[07:27:27] <ccmonster> i think 1.5 - they've done some quick releases as of late.
[07:27:36] <blackspotwiggins> yeah 6 is right around the corner
[07:27:50] <blackspotwiggins> which means 3.6 is 2 (soon 3) major releases behind
[07:27:51] <ccmonster> Jesus. they are trying to catch up with chrome and start setting the bar, it seems.
[07:27:55] <ccmonster> Yea. No doubt.
[07:28:08] <keyword> ccmonster:  like "I found this on <a href='url'>url</a>" I want to put this like "I found this on url"
[07:28:15] <blackspotwiggins> mozillas interest is not competition with chrome
[07:28:16] <ccmonster> Which is why I'd rather just SKIP the hassle, plan for ff 4+ (which will be 2 major behind) and call it a day
[07:29:58] <ccmonster> i think var myurl = $("<a href='url'>text</a>").attr('href'); will get you just the url piece. Then throw it in a string output
[07:30:18] <ccmonster> Why the sudden ramp up in releases blackspotwiggins ?
[07:30:26] <ccmonster> This year has been a flury.
[07:30:36] <blackspotwiggins> ccmonster, to get features out more quickly
[07:30:53] <blackspotwiggins> it was feature based releases before, now they have time based
[07:31:13] <ccmonster> I guess it pushes them
[07:31:16] <blackspotwiggins> which means less feature per release, but periodical incremental updates
[07:31:18] <poppiez> I'm using this extern: http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/svn-history/r1152/trunk/contrib/externs/jquery-1.6.js
[07:31:28] <poppiez> has anyone used closure compiler with ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS with jquery 1.6.2?
[07:31:37] <blackspotwiggins> i guess they saw how well chrome's schedule works and adopted something similar
[07:31:46] <blackspotwiggins> but they dont want to "beat" chrome
[07:31:56] <blackspotwiggins> their interest is promoting open web tech
[07:32:06] <blackspotwiggins> there are plenty of blog posts about that
[07:33:41] <ccmonster> I see.
[07:34:02] <ccmonster> im wondering if i should use the history.js
[07:34:04] <keyword> ccmonster:  nice and how can I detect in the text the url with <a> tag
[07:34:09] <ccmonster> or some jquery specific library
[07:34:24] <ccmonster> what do you mean keyword , please re-explain
[07:35:09] <keyword> ccmonster:  I have th string "I found this on <a href='url'>url</a>" I want to detect the url <a> for then get the attr
[07:36:10] <ccmonster> WHY are you getting text formed like that in the first place? That seems silly. Is there a way to change what content you are getting?
[07:36:28] <ccmonster> or how it's passed to that point in your code
[07:38:47] <luke_66> anybody could help me? i need to know how to use 'initially_open' or 'initially_select' option to set selected a node when th tree is loaded, and how to pass the info for the selected node (i pass to jstree instance a json array)
[07:39:22] <luke_66> sorry i forgot to say: it's about jstree :-9
[07:39:43] <jeroenem> h
[07:40:24] <lahabana> Hey guys
[07:40:41] <lahabana> I've corrected a bug in jQuery UI buttons
[07:42:37] <ccmonster> what bug was that? I am using ui-buttons on a new build?
[07:42:46] <_pr0t0type_> what is the function of returning false on, say, a click handler?
[07:42:56] <_pr0t0type_> I googled but was unsuccessful
[07:43:00] <lahabana> ccmonster: on button set the selector wasn't escape
[07:43:05] <ccmonster> e.preventDefault()
[07:43:08] <ccmonster> or return false
[07:43:15] <ccmonster> interesting
[07:43:27] <ajpiano> lahabana, if there's a bug on the bug tracker for it, create a full request, if there isn't, file one and create a pull request :)
[07:43:40] <ajpiano> _pr0t0type_ it's the same as doing event.preventDefault() AND event.stopPropagation()
[07:43:51] <lahabana> ajpiano: thx I was reading the howto on the site :)
[07:43:52] <dinosaadeh> guys is it possible to do $(selector).click(name of the function) and not a nameless delegate function?
[07:44:04] <ajpiano> dinosaadeh: yes
[07:44:20] <Birliban> i i want to make a simple hover with text, on hove text should be replaced and on mouse out the previous text should be there again... this doesn't work: $("span.time").hover( function () { var strTemp = $(this).text(); $(this).text("145s");}, function () { $(this).text(strTemp);});
[07:44:57] <ajpiano> Birliban "var strTemp" creates a variable that's local to the function
[07:45:04] <kborchers> Birliban: declare your strTemp var outside of the hover
[07:45:08] <ajpiano> or use data
[07:45:11] <dinosaadeh> ajpiano: i am trying to do that, but it is not calling the function
[07:45:26] <Birliban> aaah i see! ;-) thanks again.
[07:45:53] <ajpiano> $("span.time").hover( function () { var $t = $(this);  $t.data("origText", $t.text(); $t.text("145s");}, function () { var 4$(this).text(strTemp);});
[07:46:13] <Eviltwin> Mismatched parens
[07:46:14] <ajpiano> $("span.time").hover( function () { var $t = $(this);  $t.data("origText", $t.text(); $t.text("145s");}, function () { var $t = $(this); $t.text($t.data("origText"));});
[07:46:25] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: i pressed enter early by accident reaching for the shift key
[07:46:36] <Eviltwin> "$t.data("origText", $t.text();"
[07:46:41] <b-lew> ajpiano: check out this page loader… its pretty sweet. http://www.invisiblecreature.com/work/
[07:46:52] <ajpiano> ... ok.
[07:47:02] <ajpiano> Birliban: forget my idea entirely, i made a typo entering it in irc
[07:47:20] <dinosaadeh> ajpiano: $(".next").click(movetoNext); is not working
[07:47:29] <b-lew> I was hoping it was a plugin but it doesn't look like it from what people in here are saying
[07:47:39] <ajpiano> dinosaadeh, it certainly should work, if it isn't, please make a demo
[07:47:47] <sanity> in JQuery mobile, is it possible and/or advisable to nest header and content divs within a content div?  is it designed to support that usage?
[07:48:59] <ajpiano> dinosaadeh: it's just a simple background position animation
[07:49:20] <Birliban> ajpiano, ok, thanks... and is that chainable? e.g.  $t.data("origText",$t.text()).text("145s"); ?
[07:49:29] <ajpiano> Birliban: yes indeed
[07:50:01] <ajpiano> b-lew: it's just a simple background position animation
[07:50:13] <b-lew> with the content and image loading?
[07:50:31] <Birliban> ajpiano, and even shorter without var t :  $(this).data("origText",$(this).text()).text("145s"); ?
[07:50:46] <blackspotwiggins> ajpiano, it's using clip: acually
[07:51:04] <ajpiano> Birliban: yeah but now you're creating an extra jquery obj for no reason
[07:51:32] <Birliban> ajpiano, wich one? the second $(this)?
[07:51:43] <ajpiano> yup
[07:52:00] <_pr0t0type_> does stopPropagation + preventDefault work with $.one()?
[07:52:03] <ajpiano> blackspotwiggins: looks like it is using bg position to me but i'm just watching the css change when i hover
[07:52:04] <Birliban> ajpiano, ok... so putting this into a var is less overhead then...
[07:52:09] <ajpiano> Birliban: yes
[07:52:19] <Birliban> ajpiano, k thanks a lot! ;-)
[07:52:32] <blackspotwiggins> ajpiano, i poked around in the code before. at least some of it is using clip, not sure about text bits tho
[07:54:31] <Birliban> ajpiano, uhhm... is it really var $t = $(this) and not, var t = $(this)? if yes { why? }
[07:55:05] <ajpiano> ?$prefix @ Birliban
[07:55:05] <bot-t> Birliban, It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[07:55:49] <ccmonster> ajpiano, what would you suggest for doing html5 history api?
[07:56:02] <ccmonster> any particular plugin?
[07:56:07] <ajpiano> History.js
[07:56:11] <Birliban> ajpiano, ah, i see. ;-)
[07:56:15] <ajpiano> or i would just be using backbone so i'd use that
[07:56:19] <ccmonster> Ok. that's what im looking at.
[07:56:24] <ccmonster> backbone? lol
[07:57:39] <blackspotwiggins> ajpiano, are you somehow affiliated with backbone?
[07:57:53] <ajpiano> nope
[07:58:01] <blackspotwiggins> or do you know people who are developing it?
[07:58:02] <ajpiano> i just have started using it on my projects
[07:58:16] <blackspotwiggins> im sortof puzzled by some of the design choices
[07:58:23] <ajpiano> i've met jeremy once
[07:58:31] <Brodingo> is your application state consistent
[07:58:35] <Brodingo> or whatever
[07:58:39] <ajpiano> blackspotwiggins: jashkenas is always in #documentcloud and very receptive to ppl who have questions
[07:58:47] <blackspotwiggins> ah, thanks
[07:58:53] <blackspotwiggins> i'll drop by sometime
[07:59:49] <blackspotwiggins> i miss bulk event binding for one
[08:00:16] <ajpiano> why wouldn't you just use the events hash on the view
[08:00:23] <hariom> aro, Paveloosha: I found a problem in the previous solution
[08:00:24] <ajpiano> but yeah, i have also had that feeling
[08:00:25] <blackspotwiggins> on the model
[08:00:38] <ajpiano> cuase there are times you need to do it and it end up verbose
[08:00:46] <ajpiano> ah
[08:01:04] <blackspotwiggins> i also created my custom hook that is triggered when model is saved and before ajax starts
[08:01:16] <blackspotwiggins> to update view without waiting for server response
[08:01:33] <SoulRaven> please help me with this
[08:01:34] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/kXnSj/1/
[08:01:53] <SoulRaven> i can't populate a external varibaile with the value from the change function
[08:02:15] <ccmonster> you should be able to.

[08:02:53] <hariom> aro: window name will remain in memory as long as the user doesn't navigate to some other page (page which doesn't have link to open a new window). Now if the user comes back to the previous page (where new window link is) and opens up a new window, it will not be able to detect already opened new window
[08:04:21] <hariom> How to detect if a window is already opened using window.open ?
[08:04:24] <vladyn> anyone to work with "less"?
[08:04:32] <vladyn> less pre-processor
[08:05:14] <plombardi> Is anyone familiar with this error in jquery Mobile "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'children' of undefined
[08:05:14] <plombardi> " when calling $.mobile.changePage() ? I know the element I am trying to call exists in the HTML
[08:05:53] <hariom> Suppose if user opens a new window by click on open new window. then he navigates to some other page and doesn't close the opened window. When he again comes back to the link page and opens one more new window, how to detect that there was already a window opened ?
[08:08:11] <SoulRaven> in this example, how i insert another element to query
[08:08:12] <SoulRaven> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache
[08:08:21] <SoulRaven> $.getJSON( "search.php", request,
[08:08:42] <kborchers> SoulRaven: for your first question see this http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/kXnSj/6/
[08:09:01] <SoulRaven> i have manage to resolve the problem
[08:09:08] <SoulRaven> kborchers: thx
[08:09:28] <SoulRaven> i want to make a autocomplete field for county and city
[08:09:53] <SoulRaven> and when i select some county, to have the posibilty tu search the cityes in that county
[08:10:36] <SoulRaven> and i need now to insert an element on request query
[08:13:58] <NginxPoweredPorn> Yo, WHAT IS HAPPENIN' IN JQUERY LAND TODAY!!!
[08:14:53] <Detroiter> I just arrived to my job as chief web architect of Manhattan and I am EXCITED about building new jquery plugins the augment the Object prototype! :D
[08:15:57] <ccmonster_away> nice. :)
[08:16:05] <ajpiano> lol
[08:16:18] <kborchers> SoulRaven: you'll want to use the select event in autocomplete to store that county value somewhere that is accessible to your getJSON inside your city autocomplete so that when it goes to pull cities, it passes the value of the city field as well as the selected county. make sense?
[08:16:49] <Detroiter> The guy that had my job before me was found hanging by piano string from the Chrylser Building in Times Square. :-/
[08:17:15] <_pr0t0type_> hey guys, is it possible to bind an event on a 'children set'?  it's not working for me on the chrome/firefox console
[08:17:17] <Detroiter> (They caught him use xmlhttprequest() in sync mode)
[08:17:25] <_pr0t0type_> say if I have a parent element with 10 <p>'s
[08:17:45] <_pr0t0type_> and I want to attach a click event at $(parent).children().bind('click', ...);
[08:17:50] <_pr0t0type_> is that supposed to work?
[08:18:02] <kborchers> _pr0t0type_: yes
[08:18:06] <_pr0t0type_> that is, I want to attach that click event to all the children
[08:18:13] <_pr0t0type_> hmm
[08:18:28] <Detroiter> Music industry execs don't fuck around when it comes to building slammin' sites for their artists. :>
[08:18:43] <ajpiano> if by "slammin" you mean "flash"
[08:18:56] <kborchers> ajpiano: lol
[08:19:29] <Detroiter> ajpiano: Nope, the contractor that was doing the flash jobs has been eighty-sixed
[08:20:02] <_pr0t0type_> kborchers: thanks
[08:22:53] <Mr_Grim> he
[08:22:54] <Mr_Grim> hey
[08:23:17] <Mr_Grim> is there a jquery method that is like strncmp or C# String.startsWith ?
[08:23:42] <SoulRaven> kborchers: yes, make sens, exact what i want to do
[08:23:46] <SoulRaven> brb, 10 minutes
[08:26:02] <Patabugen_> Using the receive event of .sortable(), how can I find out details about the dragged element? (Specifically the contents of it).
[08:26:24] <Patabugen_> I get given event and ui and I can use $(this) to get the list. However I can't find the <li> itself.
[08:26:53] <ajpiano> Patabugen_: look inside the "ui" object that's sent to the callback... ui.item is the draggable
[08:27:27] <pmitchell> attr( map ) lets you set multiple attributes at once, but removeAttr() can only remove one argument at a time. there a workaround for removing multiple attributes given a map?
[08:27:56] <Patabugen_> ajpiano Ah so it is! Thank you :) I was mis-using Firebug and thinking it was empty.
[08:27:57] <ajpiano> pmitchell: i think we're fixing that for 1.7...
[08:28:12] <pmitchell> i was hoping so :]
[08:28:29] <DukeDrake> hi
[08:28:30] <kaeles> if I set with ajaxSetup async false, will that affect getJSON calls?
[08:28:32] <ajpiano> but it won't be from an object, it will be a list of attrs
[08:29:02] <pmitchell> long as it's symmetric with attr() i won't mind :P
[08:29:07] <DukeDrake> is there a jquery way of accessing document.body.clientHeight / window.innerHeight ?
[08:29:23] <ajpiano> well, it won't be argumentswise :)
[08:29:49] <kborchers> kaeles: why are you setting async false ... you should really try to avoid that as it creates a terrible user experince when the browser locks up waiting on your ajax calls
[08:30:58] <phlp> ?js "Mr_Grim".indexOf("Mr") == 0
[08:30:59] <bot-t> phlp: true
[08:32:04] <adbe> ?js "imgur".indexOf("im") === 0
[08:32:04] <bot-t> adbe: true
[08:32:45] <Detroiter> "imgur".indexOf('')
[08:32:47] <kaeles> kborchers: I only want it to be async when i specify it.
[08:32:52] <Detroiter> ?js "imgur".indexOf('')
[08:32:53] <bot-t> Detroiter: 0
[08:33:05] <phlp> ?js /^Mr/.test("Mr_Grim")
[08:33:06] <bot-t> phlp: true
[08:33:16] <Detroiter> kaeles: Why? Do you like your site to be unresponsive?
[08:33:43] <kborchers> kaeles: but that's my point. if it was meant to be used with async false it would be called SJAX ;)
[08:34:31] <kborchers> sure the option is there but you might as well just reload the page
[08:34:33] <Detroiter> ?js var madonna['sexy']; madonna.contains('sexy');
[08:34:33] <bot-t> Detroiter: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[08:34:38] <DukeDrake> is there a jquery way of accessing document.body.clientHeight / window.innerHeight ?
[08:34:45] <Detroiter> ?js var madonna = ['sexy']; madonna.contains('sexy');
[08:34:45] <bot-t> Detroiter: TypeError: madonna.contains is not a function
[08:34:56] <Detroiter> Must be v8
[08:34:56] <kaeles> Detroiter: Because I'm using the data in places that need to be synchronous, and using an asynchronous callback doesn't work correctly.
[08:35:16] <Detroiter> kaeles: Seems suboptimal no?
[08:35:37] <aaronw-1> ?js document.write(this)
[08:35:38] <bot-t> aaronw-1: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[08:36:00] <ajpiano> Detroiter: there's no string.contains in v8 either...
[08:36:28] <ajpiano> DukeDrake there's no reason to use jQuery if those are the props you want, just access them directly
[08:37:12] <kaeles> Detroiter: sure, but I'm needing it to work, which it doesn't async.
[08:37:59] <Detroiter> kaeles: Right, sometimes you just have to get it to ****in work
[08:38:07] <DukeDrake> document.body.clientHeight and window.innerHeight are height for different browers, so I though, mayb jQuery already unified this?
[08:38:09] <Detroiter> ajpiano: I said it *must be8 v8
[08:38:20] <Detroiter> ajpiano: Firefox has contains()
[08:38:29] <ajpiano> ohhh, gotcha
[08:38:48] <ajpiano> DukeDrake: does $(window).height() not suffice?
[08:38:55] <ajpiano> or $(document).height();
[08:39:03] <Detroiter> np
[08:39:16] <kaeles> Detroiter: exactly, for now, in the places i need it sync, i specify that, but I do that more often than not, and was just wanting to be able to clean up some code to use getJSON instead of the longer ajax call and parsing the response text, thats why I was wondering if getJSON "should be" affected by the ajaxSetup async false setting.
[08:39:52] <ajpiano> kaeles: yes it should be affected by the setting... unless it's JSONP
[08:39:59] <ajpiano> in which case it'snot ajax at all and can't be synchronous
[08:40:09] <kaeles> ajpiano: strange, ok.
[08:40:16] <ajpiano> not strange, logical
[08:40:24] <ajpiano> JSONP isn't ajax, it's including a script tag.
[08:40:25] <DukeDrake> ah, document.height =)
[08:40:34] <phlp> my firefox has no contains
[08:40:55] <kaeles> ajpiano: no, I mean, its strange because it doesn't seem to affect my calls, but I may need to be calling it in the same script section perhaps.  I have it in my application wide ready.
[08:41:11] <sphinxxx> anyone notice jerkiness/non-smooth animations on firefox mac?
[08:41:34] <kaeles> ajpiano: Anyhow, thats answers my question, thanks guys.
[08:45:30] <pmitchell> is callling e.g. $(selector).removeAttr(arg).removeAttr(arg2) a performance gain over $(selector).removeAttr(arg), $(selector).removeAttr(arg2)?
[08:45:36] <DukeDrake> hmmm
[08:45:51] <ajpiano> pmitchell: yes
[08:45:57] <pmitchell> k, thank you
[08:46:04] <DukeDrake> my firefox goes plain black when I try to $(window).resize( function() {  alert($(document).height());  });
[08:46:30] <Cork[home]> DukeDrake: never do alerts from resize events
[08:46:32] <ajpiano> pmitchell, it's not much of a perf gain over var foo = $("#foo"); foo.removeAttr("bar") foo.removeAttr("bam"); but if you're creating extra jquery objects or worse, querying the dom, then yes, chaining will be much faster
[08:47:04] <pmitchell> i see :o
[08:47:07] <DukeDrake> Cork[home]: well ... good hint? XD
[08:47:56] <Cork[home]> DukeDrake: but ya, its a known bug in firefox, but is dead old (changed a bit when they moved to content modal dialogs)
[08:48:45] <Cork[home]> DukeDrake: but they've never been able to trigger stop drag when alerts come, so the interface has alwasy hing
[08:48:51] <Cork[home]> *hung
[08:49:11] <DukeDrake> Cork[home]: ah, I see!
[08:49:21] <DukeDrake> good to know, it's 'only' a knowhn bug ;)
[08:49:49] <Cork[home]> DukeDrake: heh you want a link?
[08:50:17] <sphinxxx> jquery 1.5.2 and firefox mac i'm getting very jerky animations
[08:50:20] <sphinxxx> is this normal?
[08:50:27] <sphinxxx> even on the newer beta firefox
[08:51:24] <aaronw-1> so I'm trying to use the jquery ui tabs widget
[08:51:38] <aaronw-1> but it's making a <a href> of everything in the tab panel
[08:51:40] <aaronw-1> and I'm not sure why
[08:52:10] <Cork[home]> ?p @ aaronw-1

[08:55:27] <aaronw-1> hrm
[08:56:30] <BillCriswell> $agreement.is(':not(:checked)')
[08:56:44] <BillCriswell> is there a cleaner way to write this? Even though I love that's it's like a complete sentence.
[08:56:54] <aaronw-1> well
[08:56:58] <ajpiano> BillCriswell !$("foo").is(":checked");
[08:56:59] <aaronw-1> I cam put the html in there I suppose
[08:57:26] <jeffsmykil> Is there a good way to do if (".foo" doesn't exist in document)
[08:57:33] <jeffsmykil> that isn't intensive
[08:57:38] <jeffsmykil> to the browser
[08:57:49] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: Don't know why I didn't think of that.
[08:57:53] <ajpiano> there's no way to see if something exists in the dom without querying the dom, jeffsmykil
[08:57:55] <aaronw-1> is this what I need?
[08:57:57] <aaronw-1> http://jsfiddle.net/nN2WF/
[08:58:16] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: I assumed .not() would work the opposite of .is() but I was wrong. :(
[08:58:34] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: can I narrow it down to an area in the dom ajpiano
[08:58:38] <ajpiano> BillCriswell: obviously you missed my blog post :p
[08:58:38] <BillCriswell> $agree.not(':checked') returns [] and not false like I thought.. but I guess it's meant more to filter.
[08:58:47] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: I did. How date me haha.
[08:58:57] <BillCriswell> dare* even.
[08:58:58] <ajpiano> ?g jquery opposite of is is not not it is not is
[08:58:59] <bot-t> ajpiano, The opposite of jQuery's .is() method is not .not(), it is !.is() - http://ajpiano.com/2010/the-opposite-of-jquerys-is-method-is-not-not-it-is-is/
[08:59:29] <BillCriswell> The title has me lost. I'm afraid to click.
[09:00:40] <ajpiano> the opposite if "is()" is not "not()", it is "! .is()"
[09:00:46] <BillCriswell> Now that make ssense.
[09:00:49] <aaronw-1> you can have nested divs without an issue, right?
[09:01:29] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: should I use has?
[09:01:54] <ajpiano> jeffsmykil: you can use :has or just do $(this).find("whatever").length
[09:02:12] <ajpiano> either way it's not gonna be too bad resources wise...and if you have to perform the check, you have to perform the check, i guess
[09:04:08] <DukeDrake> hmm ... $(document).height() seems to decrease with every resize
[09:04:31] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: what does $(this).find("whatever").length return?
[09:05:06] <DukeDrake> kind of strange
[09:05:14] <jeffsmykil> oh right i  put it in an if statement
[09:05:15] <jeffsmykil> duh
[09:05:30] <DukeDrake> I only resize width and height goes 800 -> 760 -> 718 -> 678
[09:05:31] <hariom> Suppose if user opens a new window by click on open new window link on page1, then he navigates to some other page say page2 and doesn't close the opened window. When he again comes back to page1 and opens one more new window, how to detect that there was already a window opened?
[09:06:06] <ch3mical> Weee
[09:06:34] <BillCriswell> hariom: target attribute?
[09:07:08] <DukeDrake> (only in Firefox)
[09:07:25] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: the page is shrinking because the content is being stretched width-wise, so paragraphs for instance get "shorter" (in actual height)
[09:08:06] <hariom> BillCriswell: Can you explain how?
[09:08:44] <DukeDrake> ch3mical: it also shrinks when I shrink the width
[09:09:11] <BillCriswell> <a href="newwindow.html" target="popup"> then click a link like <a href="newwindow.html"> then you can open things from the first pop up using target="popup"... I think.
[09:09:27] <DukeDrake> (content is in a div with overflow: auto, so does not affect document.height)
[09:09:38] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: then maybe you're programmatically changing the height of something on the page "on resize" and not accounting for negative width resizes
[09:10:03] <DukeDrake> ...
[09:10:13] <aaronmcadam> hi lads
[09:10:37] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: if you don't want us to have to guess at it, try pasting your code
[09:10:41] <ch3mical> ?p @ DukeDrake
[09:10:41] <bot-t> DukeDrake, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:10:41] <DukeDrake> the height shrinks anyway, I only resize width a px and height always shrinks from 800 -> 760 -> 730
[09:11:29] <DukeDrake> ch3mical: $(window).resize( function() {$('#mydiv').append('<br />'+totalHeight ); });
[09:11:59] <DukeDrake> wait ....
[09:12:55] <DukeDrake> yupp
[09:13:18] <DukeDrake> I don't do anything, I only check height an it changes with every resize ...
[09:13:42] <DukeDrake> (I resize width only a px)
[09:13:57] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: find is much more intensive then length?
[09:14:03] <ajpiano> huh
[09:14:14] <aaronmcadam> think you're confused dude
[09:14:14] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: that code is useless to me without context
[09:14:18] <ajpiano> .length is a property of a jquery object and an array, it's a cheap as hell lookup
[09:14:24] <ajpiano> find is a DOM query
[09:14:25] <ch3mical> ?p @ DukeDrake
[09:14:25] <bot-t> DukeDrake, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:14:49] <aro> what am i doing wrong in here? http://jsfiddle.net/MUG42/1/
[09:14:52] <aaronmcadam> woo bot is back
[09:14:54] <aro> i keep getting tons of errors
[09:14:58] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: put a "working" example on jsfiddle and I
[09:15:02] <ch3mical> will take a look
[09:15:22] <jeffsmykil> ty ajpiano
[09:15:29] <aaronmcadam> anything else more descriptive would help aro
[09:15:44] <aro> :) well run it and see the errors, expr.replace is not a function
[09:16:07] <hariom> BillCriswell: I am opening windows using window.open and what actually I am looking for is that when one window is open, user should not be able to open one more of the same window.
[09:16:51] <aaronmcadam> that's not how I play :)
[09:16:54] <BillCriswell> hariom: The second argument of window.open should prevent that I think.
[09:16:55] <aro> hariom: didnt we tell you how to do that earlier?
[09:17:16] <aaronmcadam> ?mdc window
[09:17:17] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, window - MDN Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window
[09:17:48] <hariom> aro: I wrote you a message after that. I found an issue with that solution. window name will remain in memory as long as the user doesn't navigate to some other page (page which doesn't have link to open a new window). Now if the user comes back to the previous page (where new window link is) and opens up a new window, it will not be able to detect already opened new window
[09:18:11] <hariom> aro: Possibly, you haven't seen my previous message sent about an hour ago.
[09:18:25] <aaronmcadam> does it need to be a popup?
[09:18:41] <Cork[home]> aro: have you found where in your code the call that generate that error comes from?
[09:19:20] <aro> Cork[home]: i think so, ive narrowed it down to this segment of code
[09:19:26] <Cork[home]> aro: like i said before thats in the sizzle code, so it is a broken selector
[09:19:46] <ch3mical> hariom: http://graphcomp.com/info/specs/target.html
[09:20:04] <Detroiter> I need a jquery plugin to smack feature phone users around with a rusty NYC taxi.
[09:20:15] <aro> how is this a broken selector?
[09:20:26] <ajpiano> aro: don't use mouseover, and don't use is
[09:20:35] <AdTaylor> is there a standard way/method to ensure an event is bound to certain elements even if they are removed or added to a page?
[09:20:50] <ajpiano> aro: use mouseenter, mousover bubbles like crazy and you're gonna never get the accurate results
[09:20:57] <Detroiter> What's wrong with is()?
[09:21:06] <ajpiano> Detroiter: because it's not appropriate in this case
[09:21:07] <aro> ok
[09:21:13] <Detroiter> k
[09:21:18] <ajpiano> you don't need to store $hovevedElement as a jquery object
[09:21:24] <aro> why not?
[09:21:25] <ajpiano> just store it as a DOM element
[09:21:26] <aaronmcadam> hovered isn;t a selector
[09:21:30] <ajpiano> and then instead of the .is()
[09:21:39] <ajpiano> you would just do this == hoveredElement
[09:21:50] <aro> ok
[09:22:01] <aaronmcadam> not treble?
[09:22:13] <ajpiano> .is() is for when you have some kind of arbitrary selector test you want to do against an element, when you just want to check if two references are the same, use an equality test
[09:22:24] <aaronmcadam> yeah ===
[09:22:31] <aaronmcadam> can be a bit confusing
[09:22:35] <timemachine3030_> Hi everyone.
[09:22:40] <ajpiano> either way, ... it's not going to coerce a dom element :p
[09:22:50] <aaronmcadam> tehee
[09:22:58] <DukeDrake> http://jsfiddle.net/nKUBG/
[09:23:00] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[09:23:03] <aro> should i declare hoveredElement outside of the function?
[09:23:08] <aro> not as $([]);
[09:23:08] <DukeDrake> mh ... the append thing doesn't seem to work :/
[09:23:11] <aaronmcadam> ?eval !!jQuery
[09:23:11] <ajpiano> yes
[09:23:11] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: true
[09:23:13] <ajpiano> and use mouseenter
[09:23:21] <DukeDrake> ch3mical: ^^^^
[09:23:21] <aaronmcadam> ?eval jQuery === jQuery
[09:23:22] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: true
[09:23:31] <aro> ok
[09:23:41] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: looking
[09:24:33] <aaronmcadam> aro you shouldn't need the || false
[09:24:36] <aaronmcadam> part
[09:24:54] <aro> ok
[09:25:04] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/MUG42/7/
[09:25:41] <timemachine3030_> I'm reading through some old jQuery code (run against 1.2.6) and it has xpath style selectors, like $("input[@name=foo]") ... these don't seem to work any longer and I can't find documentation for them or what the '@' does in jquery.
[09:26:00] <quicksilver> timemachine3030_: just input[name=foo] for that case
[09:26:01] <ajpiano> timemachine3030 the @ used to be an attribute selector but has since been deprecated and mustn't be used
[09:26:10] <quicksilver> @ was the xpath since for attributes
[09:26:16] <quicksilver> well it still is :)
[09:26:22] <quicksilver> but jquery doesn't use xpath-style any more
[09:26:23] <aro> i am getting close
[09:26:30] <aaronmcadam> @ is xpath
[09:26:38] <aro> but it doesnt set the correct element as the hovered
[09:27:25] <aaronmcadam> you're binding it to document?
[09:27:34] <aaronmcadam> ah ok
[09:27:37] <timemachine3030_> ok thanks for the answers.
[09:28:00] <aaronmcadam> yeah the actual element is body
[09:28:04] <aaronmcadam> that's coming out
[09:28:09] <aaronmcadam> the bubbling maaan
[09:28:59] <aro> ?
[09:29:17] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[09:29:23] <aro> mouseenter doesnt work for the nested elements
[09:29:36] <kborchers[A]> DukeDrake: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/nKUBG/6/show/
[09:30:40] <aaronmcadam> you're running that func in it's own context
[09:31:15] <aaronmcadam> oh wait
[09:31:16] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: So, again, the problem is that you're changing the content of the document, hence the document height will change (increasing in this case because you are adding content to the document). Here is an example of the proper way to check what you're trying to check. http://jsfiddle.net/nKUBG/7/
[09:31:35] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: don't write debug data to the document. That's what the console is for. :)
[09:31:36] <aaronmcadam> i got it to work once ha
[09:31:47] <aaronmcadam> aro http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/MUG42/15/
[09:31:57] <mythril> jQueryUI question: is there a way to manually cause a selection event on given element (using selectable)?
[09:32:43] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: As you can see in my example the height stays firmly at (in my case) 760 no matter how many times or how big of a width change I make
[09:33:16] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: Because I'm not writing anything extra to the document on resize
[09:33:20] <hariom> ch3mical, aro, BillCriswell: I have tried the target suggestion you gave. But it only seems to work if the user remains on the same page and try to open window again and again.
[09:33:24] <hariom> This is my setup: windowid = window.open(url, '_blank', features). Now this window opens when the user clicks on a link in page1. Lets say user clicked on it and window opens. Now the user minimize this newly opened window and visit some other page, say page2, and then comes back to page1 again. Now he clicks on the same link again. It is opening another new window while the previously opened window is still open (in minimized form).
[09:33:42] <aro> aaronmcadam: it only fires the mouseenter once?
[09:33:47] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[09:33:52] <aro> if the mouse gover over some parent elements, it doesnt change
[09:33:53] <BillCriswell> hariom: Try something besides '_blank'
[09:34:09] <aaronmcadam> hey i got the div there
[09:34:13] <aaronmcadam> you're right tho
[09:34:16] <ch3mical> aro: I believe you will want to delegate that
[09:34:21] <DukeDrake> I adjusted the sample from http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[09:34:29] <aaronmcadam> maybe give it context
[09:34:40] <aaronmcadam> aro lemme try
[09:34:42] <aaronmcadam> one sec
[09:34:47] <aro> okay
[09:34:55] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: your point?
[09:35:14] <DukeDrake> "they" did it! XD
[09:35:27] <Aple> Hey guys. What's wrong with this line? $('#steps .active').delay(1500).removeClass('active');
[09:35:32] <aro> back
[09:35:32] <Aple> It doesn't delay
[09:35:36] <aro> dont know what happened there
[09:35:41] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: "they" weren't giving an example with the pretense that it wouldn't modify the original value :)
[09:35:48] <ccmonster_away> isn't delay for fx
[09:35:58] <Aple> Only for fx?
[09:36:00] <mythril> http://jsfiddle.net/A4Q2r/ <- why doesn't triggering selected work in clickHandler?
[09:36:01] <ch3mical> ccmonster_away: yes
[09:36:03] <Aple> How do I time a remove class then?
[09:36:10] <ch3mical> Aple: see ?settimeout
[09:36:11] <bot-t> Aple, var timeout = window.setTimeout(function, delayMs) - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout - cancel with window.clearTimeout(timeout);
[09:36:20] <DukeDrake> erm
[09:36:23] <ccmonster> set it as a call back
[09:36:30] <Aple> Awesome, thanks guys
[09:36:31] <DukeDrake> but now the height can't change! XD
[09:36:39] <DukeDrake> ok ok .. I get it ;)
[09:36:54] <ch3mical> o_O
[09:37:09] <DukeDrake> ch3mical: the height of the document frame on jsfiddle
[09:37:20] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: what about it?
[09:37:42] <hariom> BillCriswell: that has worked :)
[09:37:48] <DukeDrake> it's always "760" now --- resize doesn't affect it ;)
[09:37:53] <SoulRaven> sorry for the delay
[09:37:54] <SoulRaven> i am back
[09:38:05] <hariom> I just replaced _blank with a custom target name. Thanks you guys.
[09:38:08] <DukeDrake> ... cause it's a frame in jsfiddle of course.
[09:38:09] <Aple> setTimeout($('#steps .active').removeClass('active'), 1500); doesn't work either :(
[09:38:19] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: exactly. Your original complaint was that width resizes were affecting height. It was because you were adding to the DOM on resize.
[09:38:28] <Aple> Do I have to define the steps.active.removeclass thing as it's own function?
[09:38:40] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: my example shows you how to debug the resize event without adding to the DOM
[09:38:55] <DukeDrake> ch3mical: well .... why would my height DECREASE if I ADDED something to the DOM?
[09:39:00] <aaronmcadam> aro: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/MUG42/21/
[09:39:02] <Aple> Sure do.
[09:39:09] <Aple> k, got it working. Thanks
[09:39:09] <Chris__> morning folks
[09:39:20] <k1t> ah there we go
[09:39:22] <SoulRaven> i want to make a autocomplete field for county and city
[09:39:23] <DukeDrake> (which , btw doesn't affect the DOCUMENT height, because I'm adding it to a div with overflow: auto)
[09:39:53] <Jpec07> wow, big channel.
[09:40:14] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: it didn't, your debug was being inserted on on top of the other, so the newer values were on top, so it looked like it was going down, but it was actually going up
[09:40:14] <aaaaaa> sorry
[09:40:21] <Aple> How do I get a function to cycle? for instance, if I wanted this: setTimeout(dropClass, 1500); to repeat indefinitely, how could I do that?
[09:40:24] <ch3mical> one on top of the other*
[09:40:33] <k1t> so, i'm having a strange issue... on http://akta.anyehosting.com/#the-work if you click one of the slide dots, under the slideshow, it changes the height of a div (animates it) but then if you use that drop down above the slideshow, clicking the blue dots to animate the boxes stops working
[09:40:41] <SoulRaven> but i don't know hot to instert the secound field in search, i mean, i have a dropdown box from wtere i select the county, and a text field where i type the city name, but i don't know how to instert the county field in search, ussing autocmplete otion
[09:40:44] <k1t> more specifically $(this).attr() stops working
[09:40:57] <aro> aaron: it still returns false for all situations
[09:41:03] <k1t> anyone have an idea of what might be causing that?
[09:41:10] <aaronmcadam> yes i kno
[09:41:17] <aaronmcadam> I'm curious why you want to do this?
[09:41:31] <DukeDrake> erm ... wow .....
[09:41:45] <DukeDrake> it seems to work now, with console logging
[09:41:48] <aaronmcadam> if you hover over the other divs on the way down to the click me button surely that would end up with div 3 instead?
[09:41:55] <k1t> i'll paypal $ to someone who figures this bug out
[09:41:56] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: the fact that you had a <br> in there caused the append to put the data before the last output
[09:41:59] <k1t> if anyone interested
[09:41:59] <aro> because its not a child div
[09:42:04] <k1t> anyone's*
[09:42:11] <aro> i am creating an interaction on another element based on hovering another
[09:42:18] <DukeDrake> though I didn't really understand yet, why the height could decrease ...
[09:42:30] <ch3mical> :)
[09:42:35] <aaronmcadam> and do you know which element you want to hover over?
[09:42:40] <aro> yes
[09:42:40] <aaronmcadam> or does it need to be dynamic
[09:42:42] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: Well the important part is that it's working
[09:42:43] <aro> i do know
[09:42:49] <DukeDrake> ch3mical: true
[09:42:58] <aro> i just need to determine if the div#two is hovered
[09:43:09] <ch3mical> brb
[09:43:12] <DukeDrake> ch3mical: but then I'd really like to understand the height thing ....  ^^
[09:43:17] <aaronmcadam> aro http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/MUG42/22/
[09:43:19] <Jpec07> lots of questions - I think I'll throw my n00bity into the mix: trying to load content into a standard accordion, and it's giving me hell. Question is this: how much of the HTML associated with the .accordion() function should I be loading, and how much of it should already be in the page?
[09:43:29] <k1t> is it maybe breaking cuz my code that binds my events (to detect the clicks on the blue dots) is inside $(function() {} ?
[09:44:17] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[09:44:22] <aro> ok.. its still returning false though
[09:44:22] <aaronmcadam> it's the event bubbling up
[09:44:25] <aaronmcadam> yeah i know
[09:44:27] <aro> oh
[09:44:43] <aaronmcadam> look now
[09:44:47] <aaronmcadam> http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/MUG42/23/

[09:47:25] <aaronmcadam> hmmm
[09:47:29] <mythril> http://jsfiddle.net/A4Q2r/ Anyone know how I can manually cause an element to be selected via jQueryUI selectable?
[09:47:35] <checker0815> hi
[09:47:38] <aaronmcadam> nearly there
[09:47:39] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: here's your original example (fixed because you forgot to change it from mootools to jquery) http://jsfiddle.net/nKUBG/8/ .. so again you're just reading the numbers in the wrong order I think
[09:47:53] <aaronmcadam> it's testing the equality now
[09:47:55] <ch3mical> DukeDrake: I only see the number increasing
[09:48:18] <checker0815> i have some problems with jquery mobile linking. can someone help?
[09:48:52] <orplac> so im currently writing a jquery plugin that receives options from the user in a associative array and passes those options into a .getJSON request. but when the script runs and calls the variable from .getJSON, it thinks the url path to the php file is undefined.
[09:48:53] <aaronmcadam> aro: have a look http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/MUG42/29/
[09:48:53] <aro> ok
[09:49:08] <orplac> obv it must be the lack of "'s wrapping it
[09:49:09] <k1t> is $.function(){} shorthand for $(document).ready(function () {} ?
[09:49:11] <k1t> or are they different
[09:49:33] <aaronmcadam> http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/MUG42/30/
[09:49:37] <orplac> but i cant directly use a return charactre unless its in a string context.
[09:49:37] <aro> close.. but its saying true when i mouseover one
[09:49:41] <orplac> and suggestions?
[09:49:41] * Detroiter wants a Jquery plugin to drop NYC taxicabs on the English language.
[09:49:43] <aaronmcadam> ah
[09:49:51] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[09:49:51] <donburks> klt, write it as $(function() {} ); Then the answer is 'yes'.
[09:49:55] <aaronmcadam> looks like it's firing once
[09:50:18] <k1t> donburks: was just about to correct that
[09:50:20] <aaronmcadam> it's the damn event model one sec!
[09:50:24] <k1t> ty
[09:50:27] <aro> ok :)
[09:50:35] <checker0815> jquery mobile experts here?
[09:50:41] <aaronmcadam> i know  abit
[09:50:58] <k1t> i wish i knew why this drop down makes stuff not work

[09:52:06] <aaronmcadam> goddammit
[09:52:06] <aaronmcadam> haha
[09:52:10] <orplac> SoulRaven: are you talking about passing data into the json query or the address
[09:52:34] <SoulRaven> on to an adress
[09:52:34] <checker0815> if someone could me help .. send me a private query --->
[09:53:01] <SoulRaven> i am fallow the example of autocomplet
[09:53:01] <SoulRaven> lastXhr = $.getJSON( "search.php", request, function(
[09:53:22] <SoulRaven> but instead of request i want to parse 2 elements, request and another element
[09:53:22] <orplac> you cant pass two address in.. there's only one request
[09:53:28] <orplac> well
[09:53:51] <orplac> then you're php script would have to return an array (or json encoded array) of that set you want
[09:54:00] <orplac> but you cant pass two addresses into a request
[09:54:06] <SoulRaven> how...
[09:54:17] <SoulRaven>  lastXhr = $.getJSON( "search.php", ??????
[09:54:33] <SoulRaven> now i have something like: lastXhr = $.getJSON( baseURL + "/geolocations/citySearch", {city: ""+term+"", county: ""+str+""}
[09:54:53] <checker0815> am i online?
[09:55:00] <aro> no
[09:55:01] <orplac> ok, so thats fine
[09:55:02] <aro> you are offline
[09:55:08] <aro> we are the voices in your head
[09:55:15] <SoulRaven> but on the other side i can't get no $_POST or $_GET
[09:55:20] <checker0815> ohh ..how sad
[09:55:28] <orplac> but in the citySearch php file you would have to make your login return a set of two objects ina  json array
[09:55:38] <FM4k> Hey all - I'm having some difficulty with a recursive fadein/fadeout. Anyone up for helping a brother out? :)
[09:55:48] <orplac> because the getJSON only returns 1 json element
[09:55:58] <SoulRaven> yes, i know, i have the json return
[09:56:12] <SoulRaven> but i can't parse elements from one place to another

[09:57:10] <FM4k> ?stopthat kborchers
[09:57:26] <orplac> when you say you cant parse elements from one place to another, are you saying that the extra data you are passing in is not recognized by the php script SoulRaven?

[09:58:10] <aaronmcadam> you can see the inception there
[09:58:37] <checker0815> is this only for jquery and not jquery mobile? :))
[09:58:40] <aro> well if you let it work on any element that is a child of two, i think that may be okay
[09:58:42] <aro> if its easier
[09:58:54] <aro> i can probably make that work
[09:59:20] <SoulRaven> orplac: i mean if i put an var_dump($_POST) on the php script, and i look on the lastXhr i get only blank info, nothing that have been parssed
[10:00:09] <OwenMc> How do I chain fadeOut/In ? I've tired doing .fadeOut().parent().find('.other').fadeIn() But the second just appears, no fade?

[10:00:51] <FM4k> I sent you the source.
[10:00:51] <OwenMc> I'm using jQuery 1.12
[10:01:02] <FM4k> Or rather, a link to it.
[10:01:05] <aaronmcadam> it's the nested divs that's the problem aro
[10:01:11] <kborchers> and i immediately closed the PM without clicking the link
[10:01:16] <aro> which ones? the parents or children?
[10:01:19] <FM4k> kborchers: you're a cunt.
[10:01:25] <aro> o_O
[10:01:26] <aaronmcadam> because you're actually mousing over the parents to get to the children
[10:01:31] <kborchers> ;)
[10:01:31] <aaronmcadam> think about it
[10:01:37] <k1t> ugh i need an expert here and im willing to pay them
[10:01:39] <k1t> :(
[10:01:45] <aaronmcadam> my fiddle illustrates that
[10:01:49] <aro> k1t ask your question
[10:01:50] <FM4k> Anyone here able to help resolve a recursion error?

[10:02:13] <FM4k> So I need a volunteer.
[10:02:14] <aaronmcadam> no pms dude in general

[10:02:23] <FM4k> it's fucking IRC
[10:02:23] <k1t> slide dots = blue dots, under the slide
[10:02:27] <FM4k> that's part of the point.
[10:02:29] <FM4k> is PMs.

[10:03:03] <aaronmcadam> and asking a random stranger isn't breachin an NDA either?
[10:03:06] <FM4k> But I *can* send it via PM since that's not public, I can say it's for "QA"
[10:03:06] <plombardi> I have a page in jquery mobile, called "login" that needs to show automatically if a user is not logged in. What is the best way to do this? The $.mobile.changePage(...) function seems to only work when something is clicked.
[10:03:21] <donburks> Consider us a very populous QA group.
[10:03:25] <FM4k> Can't.
[10:03:28] <aaronmcadam> hahah :D
[10:03:30] <k1t> you click one, it animates the div above the slideshow
[10:03:44] <k1t> but then if u use the drop down box above it, and change to project 2
[10:03:46] <k1t> it stops working
[10:03:46] <FM4k> Aaroncadam: So if you can just bear with me, mind taking a peak?
[10:03:47] <aaronmcadam> the whole point is to solve problems out in the open so everybody can learn and input
[10:04:01] <Aple> I'm trying to make my own little cycle plugin. How could I go from the last element in a set to the first?
[10:04:03] <FM4k> Aaron I get that
[10:04:13] <Aple> My problem is, it keeps going to the last elem, then stops.
[10:04:16] <FM4k> but there' also the whole "this is THE only place to get actual answers from people who know what they're doing thing"
[10:04:24] <aaronmcadam> anyway you're sposed to illustrate your problem
[10:04:27] <FM4k> which I think my issue falls into as well.
[10:04:30] <aaronmcadam> I don't want to look at your whole app
[10:04:51] <aaronmcadam> and still he pms me :D
[10:04:53] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[10:04:54] <FM4k> Yep.
[10:04:55] <FM4k> I did.
[10:04:57] <donburks> Aple, each time you trigger going to the next item, check to see if you're already on the last index. If you are, go to the first one.
[10:04:58] <Brodingo> aple something like if next.length next else first
[10:05:02] <aaronmcadam> just closed it cheers :)
[10:05:10] <FM4k> ...
[10:05:20] <Aple> Thanks guys, I'll try that
[10:05:20] <FM4k> Why do you folks insist on being such ardent dicks?
[10:05:23] <aaronmcadam> so what's the general problem?
[10:05:30] <FM4k> RECURSION. ERROR.
[10:05:32] <FM4k> I said that already.
[10:05:38] <aaronmcadam> ?p FM4K
[10:05:39] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:05:45] <FM4k> ...
[10:05:47] <FM4k> I hate you.
[10:05:50] <donburks> FM4k, for someone who is ardently holding to his own principles, you can't fault us for holding to ours.
[10:05:51] <surfer-de> hi guys... coming with some jquery mobile problems around ... can someone help me with that ?
[10:05:51] <aaronmcadam> abstracted examples provide the best support
[10:05:51] <kborchers> heh
[10:05:55] <bloopletech> FM4k: I understand your point of view, but why are you imposing your particular restrictions on everyone else
[10:06:08] <bloopletech> how is it our fault you signed an NDA
[10:06:13] <Aple> Can I wrap last() in is() ?
[10:06:26] <Aple> So like, if is(last()) { ... } ???
[10:06:28] <aaronmcadam> FM$K: http://css-tricks.com/13414-seriously-just-make-a-jsfiddle/
[10:06:37] <donburks> Aple: Are you working with an array?
[10:06:39] <Aple> Er, maybe I should just do if last()
[10:06:45] <ch3mical> Aple: use .is(':last') I believe
[10:06:49] <Aple> I'm working with a set of <li>'s in a <ul>
[10:06:51] <aaronmcadam> i still think it's illegal even in a pm
[10:06:55] <kborchers> aaronmcadam: if he would have sent me his link one more time i was just going to paste it in the channel for him ;)
[10:07:00] <Aple> Thanks guys
[10:07:06] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[10:07:11] <WebSuperstar> FM4k needs jLove.
[10:07:11] <aaronmcadam> ooh ur nasty
[10:07:15] <aaronmcadam> why didn't i think of that
[10:07:22] <donburks> It's early.
[10:07:39] <k1t> aro: nothin?
[10:07:40] <k1t> lol
[10:07:42] <surfer-de> please ... i need help!!!
[10:07:43] <aaronmcadam> your a ui guy right kborchers?
[10:07:49] <kborchers> yep
[10:07:54] <aaronmcadam> are u on the team at all?
[10:08:05] <aaronmcadam> who was asking for jquery mobile help?
[10:08:10] <surfer-de> me
[10:08:16] <aaronmcadam> hit me
[10:08:21] <kborchers> just listed as a contributor for now ... working toward it though hopefully at some point
[10:08:34] <ch3mical> surfer-de: FYI there's #jquerymobile, as well :)
[10:08:37] <k1t> aro: line 420 on source (in chromes source viewer) is the code that stops working
[10:08:39] <k1t> by the way
[10:08:39] <aaronmcadam> ah "just" you say, good man
[10:08:45] <k1t> the selector stops working
[10:08:46] <bloopletech> So I heard from someone else that passing JS directly to the browser is evil? Would someone care to expand on that?
[10:08:50] <aaronmcadam> yeah but there's always nobody in there talkin
[10:08:53] <k1t> --> 	switch($('.rs-active').attr('data-slide-category'))
[10:08:54] <k1t> breaks
[10:09:05] <aichman2> can someone help me with installing jquery plugins?
[10:09:08] <k1t> hmm there's a good question
[10:09:08] <bloopletech> I feel I understand the risks, but it doesn't seem the worst thing ever in the scheme of things
[10:09:15] <aichman2> trying to get hoverIntent workinging
[10:09:19] <k1t> lol
[10:09:27] <WebSuperstar> $("a").madonna(); a.href = http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0dR-TAz-_Kk/TgYnRAeNf6I/AAAAAAAALvE/S3Rx-a1B5-c/s1600/mo7903.jpg
[10:09:45] <aichman2> do I just add the file to my head?
[10:09:47] <bloopletech> We happen to do this at work so I want to know my attack vectors
[10:09:51] <Brodingo> aichman2 after jquery
[10:10:31] <Brodingo> aichman2 please dont pm unless you ask
[10:10:35] <aichman2> brodingo sorry
[10:10:45] <k1t> 863 programmers and no one for short hire?
[10:10:46] <k1t> :(
[10:11:05] <donburks> bloopletech: Can you give an example?
[10:11:15] <aichman2> brodingo, so the last line in hoverIntent is })(jQuery);
[10:11:19] <Brodingo> aichman2 a wise man once said "the whole point is to solve problems out in the open so everybody can learn and input"
[10:11:25] <aaronmcadam> @docs#10009
[10:11:28] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, jQuery NYC (New York, NY) - Meetup - http://www.meetup.com/jQueryNYC/
[10:11:35] <aichman2> brodingo i hear ya
[10:11:41] <Aple> donburks, ch3mical, Brodingo: Where would you suggest I try to insert this conditional? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/455417/
[10:11:46] <dropMAU5> http://firefox.com
[10:12:09] <aichman2> brodingo does it matter that my jquery file is called jquery, not jQuery.... hoverIntent has })(jQuery);
[10:12:13] <Aple> Lines 1-8 work, 10-13 (new lines to test if it's the last elem) don't.
[10:12:14] <Brodingo> the hoverintent code should just work make sure jquery comes first, then hoverintent, then your code
[10:12:25] <donburks> Aple: Inside dropClass().
[10:12:31] <aichman2> brodingo not case sensitive?
[10:12:33] <Brodingo> the name of the file doesnt matter as long as its linked correctly
[10:12:34] <aaronmcadam> aichman don't worry
[10:12:42] <donburks> Aple: Do an if/else in dropClass()
[10:12:44] <ch3mical> Aple: you need to chain .is on a jQuery element
[10:12:46] <aichman2> im freaking out guys!! kk thanks :)
[10:13:10] <ch3mical> Aple: $(thisClassOrWhatever).is(':last')
[10:13:24] <Aple> Gotcha
[10:13:45] <ch3mical> Whatever the element you're checking against
[10:14:06] <ch3mical> Possibly just $(this).is(':last')
[10:15:11] <bloopletech> crap I forgot I had a profiled process that was going to chew up all my ram running
[10:15:14] <Aple> I think I'm doing this wrong: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/455422/
[10:15:21] <Aple> It's not running at all.
[10:15:28] <Aple> Is my if/else screwed up?
[10:16:36] <hariom> In a Ajax call, I get a response from the server and success function gets executed. While processing the data send by server, I found that it is not appropriate and remaining of the function chained in '.then' deferred should not execute, how to do that?
[10:17:05] <ch3mical> Aple: I would enslose the if condition in parens.
[10:17:14] <Aple> Here's a live example: http://pressedweb.com/example/techclearout/
[10:17:22] <amh345> does google bot see the generated source?   i've put in a script that replaces all my image alts.   im trying to figure out if google will see generated source or just regular source.   all info im finding is from years ago.   does anyone know?
[10:17:38] <aaronmcadam> hahah
[10:17:42] <aaronmcadam> google sees the static source
[10:17:49] <ch3mical> hariom: return null or false ?
[10:17:54] <Aple> Still nogo on the enclose
[10:18:15] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/1780113  console is saying History is not defined. hmmm
[10:18:34] <ch3mical> Aple: I'll take a look at the live. Just a sec
[10:18:48] <Jpec07> http://jsfiddle.net/Jpec07/yCbNW/ - Okay, so bear with me here, because I can't figure out why THIS isn't working, let alone the code I'm actually trying to run. Right now it's got a .load() that calls to an HTML file with the div layers in it, just like how the .html() is in there right now
[10:18:49] <amh345> aaronmcadam: ok, so populating alt tags via jquery is.....useless.... for googlebot
[10:19:24] <Aple> ch3mical: Thanks man. I'd like to keep learning, but I just get really stuck and can't figure shit out unless I see examples that relate to my specific problem (aka, someone solves it for me)
[10:19:31] <Aple> I never ask the same question twice though. ;)
[10:19:33] <hariom> If there is error in ajax, it automatically cancels the .then deferred. But how to cancel a .then deferred if ajax was successful.
[10:19:45] <hariom> ch3mical: return false doesn't work
[10:19:58] <aaronmcadam> hahah yeah amh345
[10:20:00] <ch3mical> Aple: well I didn't say I was going to solve it for you, but I can help you figure out what you're doing wrong
[10:20:25] <aaronmcadam> think about it for a sec, googlebot would have to actually open your page in a headless browser for the DOM to kick in
[10:20:26] <ch3mical> hariom: don't know then.. sorry. working on too many things at once ;p
[10:20:48] <amh345> im actually not too familiar with how google crawls
[10:20:49] * Jpec07 sits patiently in the corner. He doesn't even know if he's using the live preview tool correctly.
[10:20:55] <Aple> np. Didn't mean "do my work for me", meant, "solve" as in "show me what I'm doing wrong so I'll have that knowledge in the future"
[10:21:01] <amh345> i'll have to do the alt tags server side i guess.
[10:21:05] <ccmonster> nvm. got it. had a typo. fack
[10:21:15] <ch3mical> Aple: what is your objective? What are you trying to accomplish with this JS?
[10:21:16] <aaronmcadam> yeah you should be doing that and anything else you can server side
[10:22:13] <Aple> ch3mical: Basically wait 1500ms, remove class from first object in a set (this case - li's in ul), add class to next object, repeat throughout all objects until it gets to last, then cycle back to the first object.
[10:22:18] <aro> aaronmcadam: So is there a way i can return true if you hover element B, and any of it's child elements?
[10:22:42] <Aple> ch3mical: I can get it to go through once, but then it just stops.
[10:23:04] <kborchers> Jpec07: why not just use http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[10:23:06] <Aple> ch3mical: So my issue is with getting to the end of the set, realizing "Hey! This is the last thing!", and then going back to the beginning.
[10:23:24] <Aple> ch3mical: I'm a total JS newb, so the logic doesn't come smooth to me.
[10:23:37] <aaronmcadam> aro the problem is hovering over any of them
[10:23:48] <aaronmcadam> because hovering over div 3 is the same as hovering over div 1
[10:23:49] <ch3mical> Aple: gotcha. Try changing ".first()" to ".next('li:first')"
[10:24:06] <aro> i just want to know if its over div 1 or any child elements
[10:24:12] <aaronmcadam> cuz i used delegate but I dunno
[10:24:15] <aro> i dont really care at this point :)
[10:24:39] <kborchers> Jpec07: i see you are trying to use it but i'm confused by what you are doing there. can you explain your goal?
[10:24:42] <aaronmcadam> yeah well then just fire something when u hover then
[10:24:55] <armyofears> Anyone up to help me write a script using accordion?
[10:25:24] <ch3mical> aaronmcadam: if you're using delegate to add a mouse event to nested divs, make sure you use stoppropagation or stopimmediatepropagation
[10:25:39] <ch3mical> aaronmcadam: whichever is more appropriate for your needs
[10:25:52] <IanWizard> Is there a way to specify the x, y  of a click event?   (When calling .click() )
[10:26:02] <aaronmcadam> i tried
[10:26:03] <aaronmcadam> ahh
[10:26:09] <aaronmcadam> maybe stop immediate
[10:26:37] <aaronmcadam> could be the answer aro
[10:26:48] <Aple> ch3mical: Still nothing. :(
[10:27:30] <Aple> Lemme create a really barebones example.
[10:27:31] <hariom> Anybody knows how to cancel a .then deferred object from a success function of an ajax call? My setup is something like: $.when(doajax()).then([doSomeThingElse, someMore]);    I want to cancel .then from doajax() call success function
[10:27:32] <aaronmcadam> got it aro!
[10:27:38] <aaronmcadam> aro: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/MUG42/36/
[10:27:42] <aaronmcadam> ch3mical: cheers man
[10:27:49] <aaronmcadam> or somethin closer anyway
[10:28:17] <aaronmcadam> aro is it ok?
[10:28:21] <aro> no :(
[10:28:32] <kborchers> Jpec07: maybe this will get you in the right direction http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/yCbNW/5/
[10:28:34] <ch3mical> Aple: the last time I helped someone with a cyclic class swapper like what you're trying to do, we ended up using an array for each of the elements and cycling the array using shift and push
[10:28:41] <aro> i reworked my code to account for child elemnnts that are hovered over, and now i cant get that to work!
[10:28:50] <ch3mical> Aple: let me see if I can find the old example so I don't have to write a new one
[10:29:01] <ch3mical> aaronmcadam: working?
[10:29:20] <aaronmcadam> ahaha
[10:29:24] <aaronmcadam> check the fiddle aro
[10:29:33] <aaronmcadam> i think so
[10:29:39] <aaronmcadam> it's code for aro anyway
[10:29:46] <ch3mical> ah ok
[10:29:53] <aro> do you remmeber which one it was
[10:30:02] <aaronmcadam> aro http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/MUG42/36/
[10:31:25] <Aple> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/pj47e/
[10:31:57] <Jpec07> Kborchers: that was going to be my next step - only downside is that I don't quite know how to go about defining the variable from an external page (I imagine AJAX makes that easy, but I don't have the AJAX in front of me)
[10:32:15] <blackspotwiggins> ohai aaronmcadam
[10:32:27] <kborchers> ?ajax @ Jpec07
[10:32:27] <bot-t> Jpec07, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:32:40] <Aple> Anyone want to try their hand at getting this JSFiddle to cycle back to step 1? http://jsfiddle.net/pj47e/1/
[10:32:43] <Aple> Really barebones.
[10:33:31] <kborchers> Jpec07: you can take the html returned from your ajax call and drop it in place of the string in the fiddle. that example is still buggy and not perfect but hopefully gets you moving
[10:33:32] <Jpec07> ...nor the databases that the AJAX would ping to (using WAMPserver on a laptop for dev purposes - the whole thing is kind of messy)
[10:33:45] <k1t> still looking for expert freelancer for bug fix can pay via paypal
[10:34:02] <imsky> k1t, what's the bug
[10:34:12] <imsky> Jpec07: use uwamp
[10:34:21] <imsky> Jpec07: or turnkey
[10:34:28] <ch3mical> Aple: I'm looking at it, give me a min
[10:34:43] <Jpec07> kborchers: in the example you provided, I'm seeing the same problem that I'm actually experiencing: even after the content is loaded, it's not accordion()ing
[10:34:52] <k1t> imsky: if you click a blue dot under the slideshow on http://akta.anyehosting.com/#the-work it will animate the lil colored boxes directly above the slideshow. However, if you pick a project (from drop down), that feature stops working
[10:35:07] <k1t> i can answer any questions about the code
[10:35:13] <k1t> if you're looking for something, etc..
[10:35:31] <Jpec07> imsky: I mean the dev process for this project. I'm making the layout, but we're handing it to a third party for implementation to get it to integrate with Moodle...yeah, not ideal, but what can you do?
[10:35:48] <imsky> Jpec07: haha i feel your pain
[10:36:04] <Aple> ch3mical: np man. I appreciate you
[10:36:14] <k1t> imsky: it only works on project #1
[10:36:20] <k1t> switched projects = broken
[10:36:21] <kborchers> Jpec07: hmmm, works for me though after you click the "Click me" link again it breaks but this should solve that http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/yCbNW/6/
[10:36:28] <Aple> I should really just use that cycle plugin, but I'm excited about seeing how this works
[10:36:33] <imsky> k1t, ok i can fix it, do you want to PM?
[10:36:45] <k1t> yes please
[10:37:02] <Wyo_Segfault> Can someone help me find a good selector?  I'm trying to prevent folks from copy-pasting the body of a page using the jquery UI (ver 1.8.15) disableSelect() method: $("body").disableSelect()  But when I apply it to the whole body, text input fields are not only not selectable, but also not editable.  I tried $('body *').not($("input,textarea")).disableSelect(), but it still applies the disableSelect to <div> elements containing editabl
[10:37:02] <Wyo_Segfault> e elements, rendering those input areas still inaccessible.
[10:37:23] <armyofears> anyone in here want to help me with this?   http://wordpress.org/support/topic/jquery-ui-accordion-with-changing-headers?replies=3
[10:37:41] <phlp> Aple: http://jsfiddle.net/pj47e/2
[10:37:53] <Jpec07> kborchers: that actually does work pretty well. Now to put a variable from the external source, I'd just do .load("url.html") instead of .html("<code />"), right?
[10:38:04] <Jpec07> or would I use .get()?
[10:38:29] <kborchers> Jpec07: you could use load()
[10:38:44] <here4thegear> http://pastebin.com/dCerhC6C $.contextMenu line 10 doesn't work (no error just doesn't work).  But all other items after it are fine.
[10:39:12] <ccmonster> log them out here4thegear
[10:39:23] <Jpec07> kborchers: alright cool, thanks. I'm gonna try and implement it: if you don't hear from me again, that means you can assume it worked :D
[10:39:38] <kborchers> Jpec07: np
[10:39:40] <here4thegear> ccmonster: ? how to log them?
[10:40:36] <ccmonster> console.log(0
[10:40:50] <ccmonster> console.log(/what i want to log);
[10:40:52] <here4thegear> k thanks.
[10:41:11] <ccmonster> np
[10:41:30] <Aple> phlp: Wow, thanks man! :)
[10:43:24] <Aple> phlp: So what is:   if (!n.length)   asking?
[10:43:44] <ch3mical> Aple: guess phlp beat me to it
[10:44:06] <Aple> ch3mical: inorite? what a jerk
[10:44:21] <ch3mical> Aple: lol
[10:46:07] <hariom> Anybody knows how to cancel a .then deferred object from a success function of an ajax call? My setup is something like: $.when(doajax()).then([doSomeThingElse, someMore]);    I want to cancel .then from doajax() call success function
[10:46:22] <Aple> ch3mical: You could still explain what his code is doing to me if you wanted. :)
[10:46:55] <Ankabout> hi, I'm having a problem with using the slideDown() function, it's jumping at the end, and I can't seem to find out why
[10:47:02] <Ankabout> any suggestions? anyone that can take a look maybe?
[10:47:37] <ch3mical> Aple: he set "n" to the value of the .next() method, so he's checking n.length to make sure .next() returned something (if the length is null or 0 that means there was no next element), so if !n.length restarted at the first element
[10:47:39] <fission6> anyone have any leads or recs on creating, "scrolling feed updates"
[10:48:13] <kborchers> ?demo @ Ankabout
[10:48:13] <bot-t> Ankabout, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:48:31] <ch3mical> Aple: I was going to do something similar, but put it in one function and call the function using setInterval rather than setting a timeout every iteration
[10:48:43] <ch3mical> Aple: but they are functionally the same
[10:48:55] <ccmonster> hey, whats the correct html syntax for a link that I dont want the href to really have anythin gin it?
[10:49:02] <Ankabout> kborchers, http://dev.mariellemode.nl/nieuws   - Click on 'lees meer'
[10:49:12] <ch3mical> ccmonster: href="#"
[10:50:24] <b1lly> is there a way to break out of a .each loop
[10:50:50] <ateam> hi, asking how it,s possible to just get a <div> back as data and not the entire page, or how grab a div from data (entire page) $.post('index.php',  {"id":wert}, function(data) {
[10:52:40] <aaronmcadam> ccmonster: did u mean to pm me
[10:52:52] <ccmonster> yea, i was gonna ask you about this history.js demo i was doing.
[10:52:58] <aaronmcadam> never used it
[10:53:03] <aaronmcadam> pushState right
[10:53:03] <ccmonster> its probably something funky with my object literal pattern. I'm partially braindead right now
[10:53:10] <ccmonster> yea, pushState bonanza
[10:53:15] <ch3mical> Aple: this is what I would have done differently http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/pj47e/3/
[10:53:18] <aaronmcadam> you know the drill
[10:53:29] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/FVRjM/1/
[10:53:42] <IanWizard> ateam, you can use jquery within the context of the data returned.     $('div', data);
[10:53:43] <ccmonster> does fiddle auto add scripts if you put them in the html potion?
[10:53:51] <ccmonster> portion*
[10:54:40] <Aple> ch3mical: Just change the setTimeout to setInterval?
[10:55:10] <aaronmcadam> should
[10:55:13] <ch3mical> Aple: no
[10:55:20] <ch3mical> Aple: look closer
[10:55:23] <aaronmcadam> otherwise just add em in the resources pane ccmonster
[10:55:34] <ccmonster> i just added them
[10:55:35] <ateam> IanWizard: in the $.post ? or in the function of data
[10:55:38] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/FVRjM/2/
[10:55:58] <aaronmcadam> so... what am i lookin at
[10:56:10] <ccmonster> just a quick state change piece
[10:56:17] <ccmonster> but nodda. im not geting and state change
[10:56:20] <ch3mical> Aple: I removed the second function entirely, since all it did was setTimeout, and replaced that function with a simple setInterval, and removed references to the removed function

[10:57:05] <Xeon06_> Is there some channel rule against asking for library recommendations?
[10:57:05] <IanWizard> ateam, when you get the data back (the "page"), you will presumably store it in a variable, assuming that that variable is called    data,   you would use the code    $('div', data)    just like you would on a normal page

[10:58:47] <aaronmcadam> what?
[10:58:49] <ccmonster> i just use init by habit
[10:59:01] <aaronmcadam> you know you don't need an init

[10:59:15] <aaronmcadam> self executing func
[10:59:23] <ccmonster> what are you proposing?
[11:00:18] <ccmonster> so just doing a (function()){//here..}

[11:01:07] <aaronmcadam>  ( function ( $CONTEXT_VARS ) {})( $CONTEXT_VARS );
[11:01:12] <ccmonster> ive not done the self executing of a obj literal
[11:01:21] <aaronmcadam> just make it a function
[11:01:26] <aaronmcadam> and return the methods like this

[11:04:55] <zenorg> hi
[11:04:56] <_pr0t0type_> so that on mouse over, the drop down does not show?
[11:05:09] <zenorg> how do i join together a list of values retrieved by class?
[11:05:40] <zenorg> ie, i want to convert a few .foo val()'s (form inputs) into one long comma separated string
[11:06:01] <ccmonster> then listen to the mouseover event
[11:06:04] <ccmonster> and preventdefault(0
[11:06:11] <Aple> ch3mical: Had some huge debate in #javascript over which method (setTimeout or setInterval) was better and no one could make up their damn mind, so I just went with setTimeout. :)
[11:06:18] <Aple> ch3mical++
[11:06:20] <Aple> phlp++
[11:06:25] <ccmonster> so you want to concatenate input values from a form zenorg ?

[11:07:12] <kborchers> Ankabout: I am unable to reproduce that issue in a reduced test case so not quite sure what the issue is. You may want to take a look at this http://jqueryfordesigners.com/slidedown-animation-jump-revisited/ or this http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-en/browse_thread/thread/a9f3fbb7d4c036f1/de2009dcbe51dd91?lnk=gst&q=slidedown+jumps for a possible workaround if either of those are your issue
[11:07:36] <ch3mical> Aple: lol
[11:07:59] <aaronmcadam> ccmonster: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/YQqrk/
[11:07:59] <Ankabout> kborchers[A], thanks, lemme look
[11:08:13] <aaronmcadam> now in console, you can run those methods I've returned
[11:08:16] <aaronmcadam> simples
[11:08:24] <ch3mical> Aple: like I said, functionally they are the same (in the way you're using it)
[11:08:49] <ch3mical> Aple: so the only difference is your preference in that case.. do you want 2 functions or 1? Otherwise it doesn't matter
[11:09:02] <ch3mical> I prefer minimalism
[11:09:29] <ccmonster> ah||, so then app.settings()
[11:09:29] <ateam> IanWizard: can't believe it ;) how you save that in the variable ? ;) var test = $('#div', data) ?! is not working
[11:09:32] <ccmonster> and so forth
[11:09:34] * geekbuntu ch3mical, minimalism shows maturity imho
[11:10:08] <ch3mical> :)
[11:10:25] <ccmonster> would i be correct there aaronmcadam
[11:10:28] * geekbuntu (any fool can make something busy)
[11:10:52] <aaronmcadam> basically
[11:11:13] <ccmonster> lol @ basically , what part is not 'basically'  ?
[11:11:21] <aaronmcadam> no you're right nvm
[11:11:31] <aaronmcadam> just a turn of phrase
[11:11:40] <ccmonster> ok. just making sure there werent some 'gotcha's' that migth slip me up
[11:12:01] <maqr> does anyone know how $.ajaxTrasnport is actually supposed to work? i follow the example but i can't seem to get it to callback
[11:12:13] <ccmonster> even with that pattern, i'd still have to do page.ini in the doc.ready, right?
[11:12:28] <aaronmcadam> no
[11:12:36] <aaronmcadam> if you already know what you want
[11:12:39] <aaronmcadam> what's the point
[11:12:47] <aaronmcadam> just do things differently
[11:13:07] <ccmonster> i wrote a HUGE page using that style of object literal i showed ya.
[11:13:08] <aaronmcadam> set them as properties
[11:13:15] <ccmonster> i fear....this is a beast refactor lol
[11:13:16] <aaronmcadam> great lol
[11:13:22] <maqr> the extending-ajax doc is terrible, but i don't know enough to correct it :/
[11:13:23] <aaronmcadam> well you should be
[11:13:39] <aaronmcadam> always refactor if the code is gettin huge
[11:13:49] <ccmonster> yea, but i want it functioning, then refactor
[11:13:51] <aaronmcadam> if its hard for /you/ to read, imagine anyone else
[11:14:07] <ccmonster> i am 'mid-stride' on the coding, if you wil
[11:14:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[11:14:13] <aaronmcadam> i know
[11:14:20] <aaronmcadam> I refactor before it gets too big
[11:14:28] <aaronmcadam> or do it in small chunks
[11:14:42] <ccmonster> Yea. Well in my case, I am al lfor rewriting this portion, but this portion isn't working and I am more worried about that piece first.
[11:15:00] <ccmonster> Yea. I will refactor this piece, once i determine the problem, and patch it.
[11:15:04] <aaronmcadam> ok well I know nothing about history.js anyways haha
[11:15:14] <ccmonster> hahahaah
[11:15:20] <ccmonster> well any ideas whats causing it?
[11:15:26] <ccmonster> here is the original I basically refactored.
[11:15:31] <aaronmcadam> i'm too engrossed in jqm, backbone, underscore right now
[11:15:41] <aaronmcadam> any ideas what's causing what exactly?
[11:15:49] <maqr> backbone++
[11:15:53] <ccmonster> http://pastie.org/1780113
[11:15:56] <tbranyen> <3 backbone
[11:16:20] <ccmonster> it triggeres in this example, but not in mine. I am a little confused. I am also braindead from looking at VB & php and I want to rip my eyes out
[11:16:29] <ccmonster> but that's probably another discussion for another day lol
[11:16:42] <aaronmcadam> ye
[11:16:45] <ccmonster> I keep hearing about backbone.js
[11:16:47] <ccmonster> i am interesting..
[11:16:56] <ccmonster> interested* even
[11:17:02] <ccmonster> did i mention im braindead right now?
[11:17:04] <ccmonster> :)
[11:17:11] <aaronmcadam> history.html4?
[11:17:20] <aaronmcadam> wtf
[11:17:26] <SoulRaven> has any one work with autocomplet option from jquery?
[11:17:33] <ccmonster> it's a piece the guy suggests for legacy / non html5 supporting browsers
[11:17:40] <ccmonster> just ask SoulRaven , someone probably has
[11:17:42] <kborchers> just wanted to make sure everyone saw this http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-firefox-nightly-introduces-dom-joystick-events
[11:17:52] <ccmonster> hah. joystick .weeee
[11:17:59] <kborchers> what i wouldn't give to work at bocoup ... those guys/gals are amazing!
[11:18:18] <SoulRaven> i have manage to work with query right and parse the respons ok, but when i type something to search i get each letter on one row
[11:18:36] <maqr> $.ajaxTransport( function() { console.log 'foo'; } ) // this *should* be printing something on every ajax call, right?
[11:18:55] <ccmonster> fiddle SoulRaven
[11:19:02] <ccmonster> or pastie, pastebin
[11:19:10] <ccmonster> whats the ? you guys use for that prompt aaronmcadam
[11:19:24] <b1lly> is there a way to assign an "id" to an element $('selector').attr('id') = "TEST";
[11:19:30] <aaronmcadam> haha
[11:19:31] <b1lly> or something like that
[11:19:38] <SoulRaven> ccmonster: http://jsfiddle.net/NAPCF/1/

[11:20:07] <ccmonster> $('selector').attr('id','test')
[11:20:15] <ccmonster> ah cool Thanks. I need to use that haha
[11:20:24] <ccmonster> i keep typing it out fully. *tear
[11:20:38] <b1lly> how about to remove the id attribute
[11:20:40] <kborchers> yeah, better to make that lazy bot do the work ;)
[11:20:55] <aaronmcadam> haha
[11:20:59] <aaronmcadam> helper noob :P
[11:22:07] <ccmonster> the bot is a helper noob? or I am ? lol i feel like one right now..uggh
[11:22:14] <aaronmcadam> u are silly :P
[11:22:17] <aaronmcadam> only jokin
[11:22:46] <ccmonster> If only i could focus on some JS for more than a day or two.
[11:23:03] <ccmonster> anyway...
[11:23:20] <nail_> b1lly: .prop('id', 'foo') and .removeProp('id')
[11:23:23] <kborchers> ccmonster: i know that feeling ... constantly being torn between PHP and JS
[11:23:50] <ccmonster> i wish i werent ever asked to look @ php again
[11:23:50] <aaronw-1> so will the HTML police really come and get me if i .prop('id',0)?
[11:24:04] <ccmonster> YES aaron. in the night, presumably
[11:24:21] <ccmonster> .attr('id','whattosetto')
[11:24:22] <aaronw-1> where 0 = any actual number
[11:24:26] <ccmonster> sure
[11:24:29] <aaronmcadam> stop using prop man
[11:24:30] <aaronw-1> apparently it's "not good"
[11:24:35] <aaronw-1> to use just numbers
[11:24:41] <aaronmcadam> it isn't valid
[11:24:50] <aaronmcadam> you could fuck up things like ie
[11:24:56] <aaronw-1> like IE 6?
[11:25:06] <aaronmcadam> who knows that's the point
[11:25:11] <aaronmcadam> you can't be sure
[11:25:21] <ccmonster> like IE in general, cuz it blows but so do many of your users, cuz they use it :)
[11:25:24] <b1lly> is there a way to check to see if something exist in the dom?
[11:25:27] <aaronmcadam> is it really that hard to prepend a string to ur ids
[11:25:30] <sphinxxx> no one else has problems with animations on Firefox mac?
[11:25:33] <aaronw-1> well no
[11:25:35] <b1lly> i wanna do like if($(select).exists) {
[11:25:42] <aaronw-1> the sql column doesn't have it though
[11:25:43] <aaronmcadam> cool
[11:25:51] <aaronmcadam> haha
[11:25:52] <aaronw-1> so I need to add it, remove it, add it, remove it etc
[11:25:54] <ccmonster> oh my
[11:25:56] <aaronw-1> just stupid
[11:25:58] <aaronmcadam> wha??
[11:26:06] <aaronmcadam> jesus don't do that lol
[11:26:12] <ccmonster> that sounds....crazy and retarted
[11:26:16] <aaronmcadam> both
[11:26:17] <aaronmcadam> :D
[11:26:19] <aaronmcadam> yessss
[11:26:24] <ccmonster> hence the misspelling of retarted
[11:26:37] <ccmonster> anyway, DONT DO THAT :) lol
[11:27:00] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[11:27:06] <aaronmcadam> like how u misspelt it again :D
[11:27:08] <aaronw-1> $buildrow['DT_RowId']=$row[5];
[11:27:16] <aaronmcadam> aaah
[11:27:21] <aaronmcadam> shite php :D
[11:27:34] <kborchers> b1lly: you can do if($(selector).length)
[11:27:37] <aaronw-1> so I need crap like $buildrow['DT_RowId']="row-".$row[5]; ?
[11:27:43] <ccmonster> php = scourge of the earth
[11:27:53] <ccmonster> that wouldn't hurt.
[11:28:07] <aaronmcadam> yes aaron
[11:28:11] <aaronw-1> lame
[11:28:15] <aaronmcadam> uh
[11:28:18] <ccmonster> or do a nasty jquery based id rewrite lol
[11:28:18] <aaronmcadam> php is lame
[11:28:26] <ccmonster> but that would be ....nasty.
[11:28:30] <ccmonster> and nasty is bad.
[11:28:48] <aaronw-1> well I can either append the row- in the php ajax jsonifier or do it in js after it gets it
[11:28:49] <MoTiOnXml> anybody know of a good form-builder plugin/thing built in jQuery?
[11:28:51] <aaronw-1> which is better?
[11:28:57] <ccmonster> before
[11:29:14] <ccmonster> do it server side.
[11:29:21] <ccmonster> you really dont want to have to handle that in js
[11:29:26] <MoTiOnXml> forms?
[11:29:39] <aaronmcadam> do everything u can server side
[11:29:58] <aaronw-1> ok so
[11:30:13] <aaronw-1> lets say I'm populating some content
[11:30:24] <aaronmcadam> filthy :P
[11:30:26] <aaronw-1> and I need some markup around the content
[11:30:31] <ccmonster> unless your row thing is just index based, then you COULD (althougth still wouldn't suggest it) you could use the row+index of the row and pass it along as such
[11:30:54] <aaronw-1> should I build the markup around the content in js, or have the ajax source return the markup and content?
[11:31:12] <ccmonster> but again, as aaronmcadam said, server side As much as possible.
[11:31:19] <aaronmcadam> now that depends
[11:31:23] <ccmonster> whatever fits the situation...
[11:31:26] <sphinxxx> firefox mac + jquery animation = fail?
[11:31:31] <aaronmcadam> are you calling html fragments
[11:31:42] <aaronw-1> yeah, it's just text, not really stuff that works for jsonization
[11:31:56] <ccmonster> jsonization, funny word lol
[11:31:58] <aaronmcadam> haha nice verb
[11:32:08] <ccmonster> jsonification is my personal fave
[11:32:13] <aaronw-1> so for example I have:
[11:32:19] <aaronw-1> var sOut = '<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0" style="padding-left:50px;">'; sOut+='<tr><td>';
[11:32:27] <aaronw-1> var response=$.ajax({
[11:32:27] <aaronw-1>         	url: "notes.php",
[11:32:27] <aaronw-1>         	type: "GET",
[11:32:27] <aaronw-1>         	data: {ios_id:aData['DT_RowId']},
[11:32:27] <aaronw-1>         	async: false,
[11:32:29] <aaronw-1>         	});
[11:32:32] <aaronw-1> 	sOut+=response.responseText;
[11:32:34] <aaronw-1> 	sOut+='</td></tr>';
[11:32:36] <aaronmcadam> thought u might do that
[11:32:37] <aaronw-1> 	sOut+= '</table>';
[11:32:39] <aaronw-1> oops sorry
[11:32:44] <aaronmcadam> nothin like lovely js in irc
[11:32:51] <aaronw-1> my bad
[11:33:02] <aaronw-1> I can build it more server side I suppose
[11:33:07] <ccmonster> wow. that pastie thing would be helpful about now lol
[11:33:08] <aaronmcadam> jesus
[11:33:13] <aaronmcadam> that's horrible code lol
[11:33:14] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[11:33:21] <aaronmcadam> do it server side
[11:33:35] <aaronmcadam> or else jsonify it and use a templater
[11:33:37] <ccmonster> async false is default.
[11:33:44] <aaronw-1> o rly
[11:33:46] <aaronmcadam> what?
[11:33:49] <aaronmcadam> no it isn;t
[11:34:05] <aaronmcadam> how would that make sense ccmonster
[11:34:09] <aaronmcadam> or are u kidding
[11:34:40] <ccmonster> i read it wrong. and no its not default. but you sure you want async
[11:34:41] <ccmonster> and no async = false would make it JAX :)
[11:34:43] <ccmonster> $.JAX
[11:34:50] <aaronw-1> yes
[11:34:53] <t4nkd> What's the jquery function to say, "replace the content of p.foo with the content of p.bar" or, even, "replace p.foo with p.bar" ?
[11:34:54] <aaronmcadam> why is it synchronous
[11:34:59] <b1lly> how do you check to see if its the first element of the selector
[11:35:00] <aaronw-1> because I need to populate a drop down box
[11:35:08] <aaronmcadam> are you doing that to try and avoid other problems
[11:35:11] <aaronmcadam> usually a bad sign
[11:35:11] <ccmonster> .eq, index, lots of way
[11:35:17] <aaronw-1> and if I don't have the data before I drop it down then it doesn't fill
[11:35:20] <aaronw-1> aaronmcadam - probably!
[11:35:22] <aaronw-1> remember
[11:35:27] <aaronw-1> I program routers, not javascript
[11:35:30] <aaronmcadam> well stop for a second
[11:35:31] <ccmonster> got ya.
[11:35:32] <kborchers> ccmonster: i prefer SJAX
[11:35:33] <aaronmcadam> that's a lame excuse
[11:35:35] <ccmonster> :)
[11:35:42] <aaronmcadam> remember, people pay for professionals
[11:35:55] <ccmonster> aaronmcadam, no need for a litergy here man.
[11:36:01] <ccmonster> lets just help.. :)
[11:36:06] <aaronmcadam> ah well it's a problem
[11:36:07] <aaronw-1> praise be to allah!
[11:36:09] <aaronmcadam> people just give up
[11:36:12] <ccmonster> haahah
[11:36:20] <aaronw-1> so
[11:36:26] <aaronw-1> the issue is in DataTables
[11:36:27] <t4nkd> What's the jquery function to say, "replace the content of p.foo with the content of p.bar"?
[11:36:28] <aaronw-1>  there is this function:
[11:36:32] <aaronw-1> fnOpen
[11:36:41] <aaronw-1> that inserts content right underneath a row
[11:36:45] <aaronmcadam> yes yes messing with its API is fun
[11:36:47] <b1lly> hwo do i do $('.class').first()
[11:36:50] <ccmonster> ok, remove the async, store the response, then stuff it in your selectbox dropdown.
[11:36:51] <t4nkd> probably wanted replaceWith()
[11:36:52] <ccmonster> its not hard mang
[11:36:52] <t4nkd> I guess
[11:37:01] <t4nkd> or .html()
[11:37:08] <t4nkd> Google was my friend, sorry jQ -- ty
[11:37:11] <aaronw-1> well it's not a select box drop down
[11:37:16] <aaronw-1> it actually inserts another row
[11:37:16] <aaronmcadam> p.replaceWith( 'p.foo')
[11:37:27] <ccmonster> b1lly, $('.class').eq(0) or index I forget at the moment
[11:37:32] <ccmonster> one of them
[11:37:59] <ccmonster> is it inserting at the end of the rows?
[11:38:09] <aaronw-1> at the end of the last row? no
[11:38:10] <ccmonster> after the last row, rather.
[11:38:14] <ccmonster> where is it inserting..?
[11:38:14] <aaronw-1> it can insert it after any row it wants
[11:38:19] <aaronw-1> sec
[11:38:19] <ccmonster> Ok.
[11:38:31] <kborchers> b1lly: you could do $('.class:first')
[11:38:37] <ccmonster> so are you spitting out the WHOLE table html and just populating a container with jquery?
[11:38:42] <aaronw-1> http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/row_details.html
[11:39:00] <aaronw-1> no, the table is actually coming in via JSON to the datatables object
[11:39:01] <ccmonster> what kborchers said, that's the preferred way. Use the css stuff wherever you can
[11:39:08] <Double_Rainbow> hello
[11:39:11] <ccmonster> AH data tables YAY!
[11:39:21] <Haprog> DataTables is nice
[11:39:26] <aaronw-1> it is very nice
[11:39:35] <aaronw-1> I keep finding typos in his docs and sending them in
[11:39:39] <ccmonster> haha
[11:39:40] <ccmonster> nerd :)
[11:39:43] <aaronw-1> hey!
[11:39:44] <Haprog> specially with Jeditable
[11:39:45] <Double_Rainbow> can i do this? $(this).("#something").val() ?
[11:39:50] <aaronw-1> good docs are best docs!
[11:39:56] <aaronmcadam> haha
[11:39:59] <aaronw-1> haprog, are you use the datatables editable wrapper?
[11:40:01] <ccmonster> Double_Rainbow, NO
[11:40:07] <aaronmcadam> programming routers makes u very pedantic eh
[11:40:08] <ccmonster> ? traversing
[11:40:08] <bot-t> Docs: Traversing - http://api.jquery.com/category/Traversing/
[11:40:15] <Double_Rainbow> the thing is i am generating lots of divs on the fly from the database
[11:40:15] <cakehero> Can I use a string to get a key from an object?
[11:40:20] <ccmonster> lol @ aaronmcadam & pedantic
[11:40:21] <Haprog> aaronw-1: I've used it with the Jeditable plugin for one project
[11:40:22] <Double_Rainbow> i mean lots of froms
[11:40:23] <aaronmcadam> yes
[11:40:23] <aaronw-1> haprog: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-datatables-editable/
[11:40:23] <ccmonster> lol  after yesterday
[11:40:25] <kborchers> Double_Rainbow: is #something a child of this?
[11:40:28] <cakehero> var string = 'thenameofthekey'; Object.string ?
[11:40:34] <Double_Rainbow> kborchers: yes
[11:40:37] <aaronmcadam> no
[11:40:39] <ccmonster> $(this).children('li')
[11:40:44] <Double_Rainbow> ah
[11:40:48] <aaronmcadam> Object[string[
[11:40:49] <ccmonster> or whatever you want
[11:40:50] <aaronmcadam> Object[string]
[11:40:52] <droose> Does anyone know if there is a way to clear previous ajax calls before you call another one?
[11:40:53] <Double_Rainbow> lemme try that
[11:40:57] <kborchers> then you could do $(this).children("#something").val()
[11:40:57] <cakehero> aaronmcadam perfect - thank you
[11:41:01] <aaronmcadam> np
[11:41:17] <ccmonster> kborchers has the full example Double_Rainbow
[11:41:19] <aaronw-1> I wish the 'jeditable' plug in was called something else, because even though it has the word TABLE in it, it has nothing to do with tables
[11:41:22] <aaronmcadam> dot syntax can only be used for actual properties
[11:41:23] <kborchers> but since #something should be unique why not just do $("#something").val()
[11:41:33] <ccmonster> why do you want to do that droose
[11:41:39] <aaronmcadam> if you're programmatically returning them, you need array [] syntax
[11:41:58] <aaronmcadam> kborchers++
[11:42:07] <Haprog> aaronw-1: I think that's different than what I used then. And I'm on IRC with my phone on a bus atm so too lazy to check. :P
[11:42:30] <aaronw-1> I even corrected a typo in the comment headers of datatables.editable plugin and sent it in as a patch to the source :(
[11:42:34] <aaronw-1> but he did not reply

[11:43:13] <droose> ccmonster My problem is I have one html page where hide and show pages for an html 5 Mobile app, so when a user clicks 2 or more links that load the requested page, it begins incrementing the amount of $.ajax requests and the container div is overrun with data. Basically my goal is for the user to click a link and it loads the requested page and clears the old $.ajax requests from the previous ajax loaded content.
[11:43:48] <ccmonster> clear the div on the success: piece
[11:44:00] <ccmonster> $('myajaxcontainer').clear() or .empty()
[11:44:12] <ccmonster> before you load the new stuff in

[11:46:27] <zoned> if i call a function which performs an ajax query, is there a way to wait for that to finish before executing the code below the initial function call?
[11:46:42] <droose> k I will get something live to show the issue
[11:46:47] <ccmonster> thanks droose
[11:46:56] <ccmonster> complete: in the ajax call perhaps
[11:47:05] <Double_Rainbow> kborchers: what if its not a children?

[11:49:00] <ccmonster> show some pseduo code at least of your situation
[11:49:09] <ccmonster> pseudo*
[11:49:23] <kborchers> Double_Rainbow: what are you trying to get the value of?
[11:49:31] <Double_Rainbow> $(".button1").click(function() {
[11:49:31] <Double_Rainbow> 			alert( $(this).children("textarea").val() );
[11:49:45] <zoned> ccmonster, my ajax call is in a loop, but my loop counter finishes before the first ajax call even completes
[11:49:57] <mixandgo> I have this html block: <div id="block"><span>A</span><span>B</span></div> how do you use $('#block') to remove A and B from inside the spans and then return the html back
[11:50:09] <SoulRaven> any ideea way on the autocompletition, every letter from response is on a separate row?
[11:51:10] <ccmonster> that's strange zoned , ?demo please
[11:51:19] <mixandgo> SoulRaven: maybe the tag that wraps each letter has a display: blck somewhere in your css ?
[11:51:25] <Double_Rainbow> kborchers: any idea? :(
[11:51:33] <kborchers> Double_Rainbow: best bet would be to give your textarea an id ... if you won't do that, then do $(this).siblings("div textarea").val()
[11:51:47] <SoulRaven> mixandgo: each letter is on a separate li
[11:52:04] <Double_Rainbow> kborchers: i cannot give unique id, since i will be generating lots of them
[11:52:05] <mixandgo> SoulRaven: so then the li has a display: block somewhere
[11:52:16] <Double_Rainbow> i mean these forms
[11:52:27] <kborchers> ok, then try that sibling selector
[11:53:51] <SoulRaven> the li is generated by autocompletition
[11:54:54] <SoulRaven> i mean something like: <li class="ui-menu-item" role="menuitem"><a class="ui-corner-all" tabindex="-1">P</a></li>
[11:55:02] <SoulRaven> for each letter
[11:55:41] <SoulRaven> but if i read all the letters, forms the corect response, the problem is that the letters is not on the same row, in a single li

[11:56:48] <Chiramisu> Quick question... is .attr("type", "text") valid for an "input" element?
[11:57:32] <Chiramisu> I mean is that proper sytax & a valid attribute?
[11:57:45] <ccmonster> that's an odd way to do
[11:57:47] <ccmonster> it
[11:58:23] <kborchers> Chiramisu: the syntax is correct but i think IE has a problem with that sometimes ... not sure though. remember changing input type not working in IE for some reason. anyone else confirm that?
[11:58:54] <Chiramisu> I think it works in IE9 though, but I could be mistaken.
[11:59:07] <zoned> can anyone help with this ajax problem? http://pastebin.com/mxVBVHbu
[11:59:27] <kborchers> Chiramisu: maybe but i still have to support back to 7 so ... :/
[11:59:41] <ccmonster> create a variable forn var done = false, then on success, set it to true, do an iff in your loop and continue
[11:59:58] <ccmonster> or a trigger on a callback, or the $.ajax{complete:}
[12:00:00] <ccmonster> do something
[12:00:34] <Chiramisu> @ccmonster: I know it's weird lol. The root problem though is that I'm trying to implement the built-in "combobox" example for the jQuery UI. That freaking thing is a pain in the arse. It's almost 200 lines of code, and I can't get it to work >.<
[12:00:46] <zoned> 'on success set it to true' how do i do this?
[12:01:07] <ccmonster> you could also do a async:false
[12:01:12] <ccmonster> and this would get you around that
[12:02:11] <Double_Rainbow> HUZAAAAAAA HACKED IT!!!!! @ kborchers
[12:02:29] <ccmonster> i would do a async:false
[12:02:38] <kborchers> Double_Rainbow: cool
[12:03:13] <kborchers> Double_Rainbow: did siblings() work? i was testing and it didn't work quite right. got it to work with $(this).closest("form").find("textarea").val()
[12:03:14] <stefancrs> hey, we're currently using the scrollable plugin from jquery tools on http://slimjim.com/, but need to replace it for the horizontal scroller on the bottom of the page (it
[12:03:16] <stefancrs> gah
[12:03:17] <Chiramisu> btw, if someone is willing to help me out with a clean implementation of the jQuery UI Combobox, I would really appreciate it. Just PM me.
[12:03:18] <stefancrs> it's buggy
[12:03:21] <groundnuty> hey, is there some popular/worth recomendign lib for parsing yaml?
[12:03:23] <stefancrs> any ideas what to replace it with?
[12:03:41] <stefancrs> should I just roll my own code?
[12:04:49] <zoned> $.post("./ajax/nextStep.php",{'step':theStep}, function(data) { ... } );       where does the async:false go?
[12:05:01] <ccmonster> Chiramisu, whats your prob again?
[12:06:01] <aaronw-1> speaking of docs, the jeditable docs do drive me crazy
[12:07:31] <Double_Rainbow> kborchers: no, i had to give each button a uniq id and each textarea a class name "answer"+thats same unique id
[12:07:35] <Double_Rainbow> its a dirty hack
[12:07:39] <Double_Rainbow> but it works lol
[12:07:56] <stefancrs> gah, bbl
[12:08:17] <doubletap> I have a situation where there are multiple versions of jquery running on a page and causing conflicts like find() not existing. So, can I rename jQuery without changing the code?
[12:08:48] <ccmonster> yikes. First off, why are multiple versions running? that's insane
[12:08:59] <ateam> zoned: you know how to get a specifig <div> out from data ? ($.post)
[12:09:07] <doubletap> 3 versions to be exact, ccmonster.
[12:09:09] <doubletap> :)
[12:09:15] <ccmonster> YIKES. 3 times crazy.
[12:09:18] <Chiramisu> ccmonster, I want to implement this on my site:
[12:09:20] <Chiramisu> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox
[12:09:31] <zoned> ateam, what?
[12:09:33] <kborchers> i wouldn't call that dirty, though why not give the textarea and ID of answer+uniqueID instead of class ... that's what i was saying to do from the beginning, then you can just do $("#answer"+$(this).attr("id")).val() and it's much more efficient
[12:09:36] <ccmonster> ateam, just set the div to a variable
[12:09:39] <kborchers> Double_Rainbow: ^^^
[12:09:40] <Chiramisu> But the code is NASTY!! and long.
[12:09:43] <doubletap> flowers.com is running two of them and we are injecting a third via an extension ccmonster.
[12:09:51] <Brl4n> double:yes you can.  You just need to control the scopes....conflicting libraries is what to search for.
[12:09:52] <ateam> ccmonster:  var test = $('#soso', data).html(); ?
[12:09:56] <ccmonster> flowers.com is ...retawwwded
[12:09:58] <ccmonster> :)
[12:10:09] <ccmonster> try it out ateam.
[12:10:16] <ateam> it gives me null
[12:10:23] <Double_Rainbow> kborchers: hmmm true true, i agree
[12:10:24] <ccmonster> just try #soso
[12:10:47] <ccmonster> Chiramisu, where is your problem>?
[12:11:05] <doubletap> Brl4n: i can see the conflicting libraries but how do I change ours to be bQuery instead of jQuery?
[12:11:15] <zoned> ccmonster, can i use async:false with $.post ?
[12:11:37] <imsky> use it with $.ajax
[12:11:58] <zoned> i thought .post used .ajax behind the scenes anyway...
[12:12:05] <imsky> it does
[12:12:11] <doubletap> Brl4n: as far as I can see, jQuery is attached to the window object inside. is there another parameter I can pass during the instantiation of jquery to change the ending namespace?
[12:12:17] <zoned> so why can't i say async:false in a $.post
[12:12:25] <imsky> try it
[12:12:28] <imsky> you'll find out
[12:12:35] <Chiramisu> ccmonster: If you click the "view source" you'll see that the code is very long, and they setup the DOM elements using jQuery which in my opinion is ugly. My root problem, is getting the button to expand the elements from the HIDDEN dropdownlist containing the (in my case) dynamically populated list.
[12:13:07] <zoned> imsky, i've already found out it doesn't work. i'm new to this so i don't know if i'm using the wrong syntax or if i'm trying to do something i can't do
[12:13:08] <Shishire> Does anyone know of a way to access the object that is the current scope?  Like the reverse of the with operator?  Specifically, I want to access the parent closure scope, but I figure this is the first step.
[12:13:21] <imsky> zoned, use $.ajax, trust me
[12:13:25] <ccmonster> so ...do you have your own demo Chiramisu ? or a line in that code you are particularly talking about? im doing like 3 things
[12:13:27] <Brl4n> doubletap:var $bQuery = jQuery.noConflict(); $bQuery(document).ready(.....);
[12:13:37] <ccmonster> im writing some mapreduce jobs and my brain is dead, forgive me
[12:13:57] <ateam> ccmonster: then i get the content of #soso but not from the requested object data (var test = $('#soso').html();)
[12:14:02] <doubletap> Brl4n: you are using jQuery as defined at the window level. i want to change it before it is assigned to the window.
[12:14:09] <ccmonster> just use the $.ajax and change from GET to POST ateam
[12:14:39] <Chiramisu> haha, I really appreciate your willingness to help though ccmonster. You have no ideal I've been wrestling with this code. I'll get you a snippet, I don't have a demo unfortunately.
[12:14:44] <Brl4n> doubletap: omg...
[12:15:05] <Brl4n> doubletap: I'll need to get my thinking beer for that one.
[12:15:11] <ccmonster> A snippet will help everyone out Chiramisu
[12:15:25] <Chiramisu> ccmonster, also be aware I'm implementing this from an ASP.NET server, but that shouldn't be an issue at all.
[12:15:26] <doubletap> Brl4n: i will buy you a second if you have a solution :)
[12:16:06] <zoned> if i use .ajax, i will only be able to call success and error functions, i want some code to execute regardless of success or error. $.post allows me to just put in function(data) {..}
[12:16:12] <Chiramisu> k, gimme a few minutes to tweak it first.
[12:16:17] <zzaichik> Hey, how could I do $(this.class) ?
[12:16:30] <Brl4n> doubletap: Are they all different version of jquery?
[12:16:38] <zoned> ugh. would someone just help me translate: $.post("./ajax/nextStep.php",{'step':theStep, 'modelId':modelId}, function(data) {..}  );        to it's $.ajax equivalent?
[12:16:51] <zoned> nothing i do seems to work
[12:17:29] <doubletap> Brl4n: yes
[12:18:35] <Brl4n> doubletap: over my head.  but I assume you looked at http://forum.jquery.com/topic/multiple-versions-of-jquery-on-the-same-page
[12:20:23] <doubletap> Brl4n: that is the technique that is currently failing.
[12:20:38] <Brl4n> doubletap: seems like you're fixing a symptom rather than the problem.  I'd figure out how remove the 3 versions.  That isn't a sustainable path to go down, no matter what your client says.
[12:20:58] <doubletap> we dont own the site with the other two versions
[12:22:17] <doubletap> in the jQuery wrapper function there are two arguments. the first appears to be for the window object., but the second does not appear to be used. does anyone know what it is for?
[12:22:39] <ccmonster> $(this).hasClass('classname')
[12:22:44] <ccmonster> ?
[12:23:13] <ccmonster> ^^ zzaichik
[12:24:04] <zzaichik> ccmonster:  it needs to be able to change with .hover.
[12:24:20] <ccmonster> you want a particular element first though?
[12:24:29] <ccmonster> $('selector.class').hover()

[12:25:54] <ateam> ccmonster: but still the same, doesn't get the content from the requested object ;( http://pastie.org/2346475
[12:27:01] <ccmonster> the response is data
[12:27:04] <ccmonster> you need to grab it from data
[12:27:30] <ccmonster> what does data return?
[12:28:11] <ateam> ccmonster: data returns the entire page,
[12:28:26] <ateam> ccmonster: yes searching for a way to grab it from data

[12:30:59] <SoulRaven> i am ussing this code for autocomplete a text field with city name, based on the couny name before selected
[12:31:06] <doubletap> i guess my only option is to change the global exposure line.
[12:31:17] <zoned> ccmonster, i changed my code to use .ajax .... inside my complete:function(data) { var json = jQuery.parseJSON(data) ....... json is always coming back as null now. do i need to do something like data.responseText? what am i missing
[12:31:43] <SoulRaven> but when i get the city name, each leter is on a separate row, on a separate li, any ideea how?
[12:31:45] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/NAPCF/2/
[12:32:23] <ccmonster> zzaichik, something along these lines : http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/UAWZg/1/
[12:33:57] <Chiramisu> Alright ccmonster I've got it down to the 35 lines of code. I cleaned it up the best I could. There's the jQuery, ASP.NET control, and VB.NET codebehind.
[12:33:58] <Chiramisu> http://pastebin.com/EPSy4nqx
[12:34:15] <ateam> ccmonster: this puts the entire page with the correct result into the div ;)  var test = $('#soso').html(data);
[12:34:29] <ccmonster> ok
[12:34:39] <ateam> ccmonster: but not the #div from data ;(
[12:35:04] <Chiramisu> Be warned though, I've spent hours upon hours. I'm hoping your expertise is far superior to mine and can help me find this bug quick. The prob is that the jquery ui button is not showing the dropdown list.
[12:35:15] <ccmonster> $(data).child('#mydiv') perhaps
[12:35:41] <ateam> ok will try
[12:35:52] <Chiramisu> ccmonster, I'll be watching on and off, just let me know when you start taking a look. I'm patient. Mention my name to get my attention. Thanks bud :)
[12:36:22] <ccmonster> btw, is your datatype set to html ateam ?
[12:37:21] <zzaichik> ccmonster:  Okay, But what I want to do is target BOTH list items with the same class    http://jsfiddle.net/UAWZg/3/
[12:37:37] <zzaichik> Rather than one list item at a time
[12:37:48] <zzaichik> all list items that share a classname
[12:38:09] <Brodingo> zzaichik sounds like a job for css
[12:38:12] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/buttersrugby/UAWZg/4/
[12:38:43] <ccmonster> but I would go the addClass, removeClass route and let css handle this, hoenstly.
[12:39:24] <aaronw-1> grrr
[12:39:25] <zzaichik> Yeah, I know how it should be done.  I was just wondering if there was any way to do that.
[12:39:37] <ccmonster> huh?
[12:39:41] <ccmonster> what aaron?
[12:39:47] <aaronw-1> I just wanted 15 minutes because I didn't understand the difference between if (something) and if (something === FALSE)
[12:39:52] <aaronw-1> damn you php!
[12:40:13] <ccmonster> haha
[12:40:17] <ccmonster> oh treble...
[12:40:27] <sphinxxx> anyone know why this is so laggy/choppy on firefox mac?  https://opensky.com/p/grid-slide-copy2
[12:41:41] <ccmonster> run an audit on it sphinx.
[12:41:46] <ccmonster> look in chrome dev tools
[12:41:54] <ccmonster> or profile it in firefox
[12:43:01] <SoulRaven> but if i read all the letters, forms the corect response, the problem is that the letters is not on the same row, in a single li
[12:43:10] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/NAPCF/2/
[12:43:18] <SoulRaven> i am ussing this code for autocomplete a text field with city name, based on the couny name before selected
[12:43:26] <SoulRaven> please help me with some ideea
[12:43:30] <SoulRaven> i am realy stuck
[12:43:50] <sphinxxx> ccmonster: where do i see the profile? it says profiler running.
[12:44:17] <flier1> how do i get an array of all elements of class "module"?
[12:44:32] <flier1> $(".module").length returns 12
[12:44:37] <ccmonster> $('.modeul);
[12:44:42] <flier1> but how do i loop through each of them to see their innerhtml?
[12:45:19] <ccmonster> var many = $('.module); $.each(many,function(i,item){console.log(item)})
[12:46:08] <ateam> ccmonster: yes it is, var test = $(data).children('#soso'); not working mhh strnage...
[12:46:15] <sphinxxx> ccmonster: it runs fine in chrome
[12:46:28] <ccmonster> just audit it, see where it hands the most, and that should give you an idea
[12:46:47] <ccmonster> sphinxxx, http://getfirebug.com/javascript
[12:46:59] <Chiramisu> Sorry to butt in, but I agree completely with the addClass, removeClass argument. Letting CSS handle styling is best. It's makes the code far more maintainable. :)
[12:47:27] <ccmonster> Yes. Always defer to CSS where possible. Let CSS do what it is good at.
[12:47:38] <ccmonster> CSS for presentation, HTML for structure, JS for behavior
[12:47:40] <ccmonster> in a nutshell
[12:48:05] <Chiramisu> exactly ccmonster :)
[12:48:18] <flier1> how do i see the output of console.log(item) ?
[12:48:25] <ccmonster> look in the console
[12:48:27] <ccmonster> or firebug in ff
[12:48:33] <Chiramisu> My struggle is with the JS, haha. I've got much more experience with the others.
[12:48:41] <ccmonster> right click , inspect element, look for "CONSOLE"
[12:48:45] <sk8ball> Why does IE9 prompt to allow "ActiveX Content" when it's actually just javascript/jquery stuff
[12:48:46] <Chiramisu> Hence my struggles with the combobox >.<
[12:48:49] <ccmonster> depends on the browser too
[12:48:51] <sk8ball> no activex
[12:49:00] <ccmonster> because IE is balls
[12:49:04] <strawberrybunny> ^
[12:49:04] <Chiramisu> It's weird like that sk8ball
[12:49:12] <sk8ball> yes i know Ie is balls
[12:49:18] <Chiramisu> lol, yeah
[12:49:22] <sk8ball> but unfo4rtunately it has a large marketshare
[12:49:26] <sk8ball> that we have to cope w/
[12:49:46] <Chiramisu> IE9 and 10 are looking to be VASTLY better than their predecessors though.
[12:49:51] <sk8ball> since when is javascript "activex"
[12:50:25] <aaronw-1> I just prefer to think of === as "really"
[12:50:29] <sk8ball> god i thought activex got thrown out w/ the trash years ago
[12:50:30] <aaronw-1> is it REALLY true?
[12:50:32] <aaronw-1> or just mostly true
[12:50:45] <Chiramisu> Aye, I have to develop my project for IE because it's my companies "official browser" and because it will run via a SharePoint portal. Maybe even in a WebPart if I can get that to work, dunno.
[12:50:46] <Brodingo> heh
[12:51:08] <Chiramisu> aaronw-1, lol
[12:51:42] <aaronw-1> and of course then you need ====
[12:51:49] <aaronw-1> when it absolutely positively has to be true
[12:52:51] <Chiramisu> "if and only if" isn't it?
[12:52:52] <sphinxxx> ccmonster i may have found the culprit
[12:53:10] <ccmonster> ooh :)
[12:53:11] <sphinxxx> would this be slow ;  var $curbox = $(this);   inside of a mouseover live event
[12:53:27] <ccmonster> that could get nasty
[12:53:43] <ccmonster> you got that snippet of code around?
[12:53:50] <sphinxxx> yea sec
[12:53:51] <Chiramisu> Me?
[12:54:09] <ccmonster> naw, sphinxxx , but you to if you got something
[12:54:12] <ccmonster> im stiff multi tasking
[12:54:37] <sphinxxx> http://jsfiddle.net/tZezF/
[12:55:25] <Chiramisu> I do, but I don't want to overwhelm you, just let me know when is a good time. :)
[12:55:31] <Chiramisu> @ccmonster
[12:56:03] <ccmonster> send it whenever. i will look when i can
[12:56:52] <ccmonster> you maybe want to ref the $curbox outside of the event
[12:57:05] <ccmonster> then $curbbox.live()...
[12:57:07] <Chiramisu> Here's the link then ccmonster, http://pastebin.com/EPSy4nqx
[12:57:17] <brettgoulder> sphinxxx, delegate is more performant than live
[12:57:29] <ccmonster> and bind or delega...damnit brettgoulder beat me to it
[12:57:37] <brettgoulder> haha :D
[12:57:41] <Chiramisu> Chat my name to get my attention when you're ready for meh ;)
[12:57:44] <imsky> let's have a .live protest
[12:57:55] <imsky> a... .live(8) protest
[12:57:58] <ccmonster> hot damn Chiramisu lol
[12:58:21] <ccmonster> where is your problem line Chiramisu
[12:58:28] <ccmonster> id rather not parse it all out in my head lol
[12:58:29] <Chiramisu> LOL
[12:58:41] <Chiramisu> You must have missed it before when I was telling you about it :P
[12:59:14] <b1lly> is there a way with jquery sortable to return the ELEMENT that the list item came from?
[12:59:17] <sphinxxx> hmm, but ccmonster, $curbox is supposed to hold the element the user is currently mousing over
[12:59:21] <sphinxxx> so it has to be inside the event
[12:59:21] <b1lly> i know how to return the element that it's going into
[12:59:30] <b1lly> but i want to know where it came from
[12:59:46] <Chiramisu> The issue is that the <button> on line 27 is not toggling the DDL.
[13:00:15] <brettgoulder> sphinxxx, switch in delegate() instead of live()
[13:01:18] <Chiramisu> ccmonster, The demo page apparently generates a <ul> for display purposes and references the ddl for selection on the postback. The problem is I can't get it to display the ddl on the button click. Another cosmetic issue is that the entered text is not getting formatted, but rather displaying the styling tags.
[13:01:24] <Chiramisu> That's the gist of it.
[13:01:50] <sphinxxx> brettgoulder, thx
[13:01:56] <Chiramisu> Sorry to trouble you guys... this has been causing me a headache for almost a week; off and on.
[13:02:05] <Chiramisu> Heck, more than that prolly.
[13:03:50] <brettgoulder> sphinxxx, check the docs on how to use it, it's fairly intuitive and the performace gains are sweet
[13:04:11] <Chiramisu> On a side note, I'm not happy with the ugliness of the code on lines 26-29. As noted, this was code generated by jQuery in the demo.
[13:06:14] <Chiramisu> btw Brian, I'd be happy to email this to you so you can get to it when you have more time.
[13:06:34] <Chiramisu> ... if that's preferable, that is.
[13:07:01] <Chiramisu> I need to get back to designing the database anyway :)
[13:07:12] <Chiramisu> @ccmonster
[13:07:30] <ccmonster> yes?
[13:08:09] <Chiramisu> oh, that wall of text was directed at you :P
[13:08:13] <Chiramisu> sorry
[13:09:44] <ccmonster> i have my own issue with History.js
[13:09:47] <ccmonster> bah
[13:10:04] <ccmonster> it seems so simple, yet it's being so retawded. And by that I mean, I'm being retarted I'm sure
[13:10:34] <Chiramisu> :P
[13:11:25] <uptownben> Hi All
[13:11:35] <dreinull_> is there a problem with this call? {return $.ajax(("/url/" + value)({...} I get "Uncaught TypeError: string is not a function"
[13:11:44] <Chiramisu> Hi uptownben :)
[13:11:54] <uptownben> Hi Chiramisu
[13:13:01] <madprops> how can I check if an image is not zoomable... that is if it is stretched to it's full width and height?
[13:13:15] <Chiramisu> It appears you have unmatching brackets dreinull, and shouldn't you put that in an actual function? Just a thought.
[13:13:37] <sphinxxx> brettgoulder: changed to delegate but still giving me lag problems in ff mac, although performance in testing seems to be a bit better
[13:14:35] <sphinxxx> madprops: you can compare the width/heights attributes of the <img> tag to the image file (the src) actual width/height
[13:14:48] <brettgoulder> yea
[13:14:51] <dreinull_> Chiramisu: it's only part of a script, the full script is here in Coffeescript: http://fpaste.org/jbJz/ line 3
[13:14:53] <brettgoulder> cool
[13:15:01] <uptownben> So I am doign some Jquery dev on my mac and I have a Linux VM running to act as a remote server, shouldn't I be able to make $.ajax() calls to the "remote server" even though it has a different domain name/ip address?
[13:15:14] <Chiramisu> Hmmm, maybe there's an "easier" solution to my problem. Anyone know if it's possible to enable text entry on a dropdownlist? Maybe that could act as my "combobox"
[13:16:22] <aaronw-1> it depends hwo strictly you define 'drop down list'
[13:16:28] <aaronw-1> there is a autocomplete plugin
[13:17:02] <ccmonster> hey brettgoulder , any chance you could help me with history.js demo i am trying to mess with?
[13:17:20] <ccmonster> uh, that could be uglyuptow
[13:17:29] <ccmonster> that could be ugly uptownben **
[13:17:30] <Chiramisu> the ddl is from an ASP.NET Control
[13:17:50] <brettgoulder> i'm kinda up to my eyeballs in client stuff at the moment
[13:17:57] <brettgoulder> but I could have a look ccmonster
[13:18:01] <Chiramisu> Yes, an autocomplete is what I want, but the dropdown portion of the combobox is giving me a heck of a time.
[13:18:31] <uptownben> ccmonster: really? shouldnt I be able to perform an ajax call to like , twitter or something from my JS/JQuery app?
[13:18:40] <dreinull_> Chiramisu: the autocomplete plugin gives you a dropdown
[13:18:57] <dreinull_> do you need autoselect?
[13:19:11] <Chiramisu> Aye, I just can't figure out how to implement it. The "demo" code is HIDEOUS >.<
[13:19:28] <dreinull_> there is an extension that is used in my paste :)
[13:19:31] <Chiramisu> I don't mean to complain, I know it's a new feature in jQuery, but ACCKKK!
[13:19:32] <Chiramisu> lol
[13:19:37] <Chiramisu> http://pastebin.com/EPSy4nqx
[13:19:37] <SoulRaven> Chiramisu: don't tell me that ou have the same problem
[13:19:49] <Chiramisu> That's my code if you wanna take a look dreinull_
[13:20:10] <SoulRaven> Chiramisu: i mean each letter is on a diferent li, but the letters are from the same word
[13:20:23] <Chiramisu> Haha, I'm seriously considering posting a blog post on this once I get it figured out, just for all the other poor wandering souls out there :P
[13:20:36] <dreinull_> I'm no js expert but the extensio is on github. lets see if i can find it again
[13:20:54] <Chiramisu> LOL, I had that issue too SoulRaven. I addressed that with my parsing function in the codebehind.
[13:21:03] <ccmonster> i'd appreciate anything. my brain hurts
[13:21:08] <ccmonster> i just need some fresh eyes brettgoulder
[13:21:10] <uptownben> I see that people use an <a> link to overcome some cross site issues?
[13:21:21] <Chiramisu> Haha, poor ccmonster, I completely understand how you feel :P
[13:21:45] <dreinull_> Chiramisu: http://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui-extensions
[13:22:10] <brettgoulder> ccmonster, jsfiddle it?
[13:22:10] <SoulRaven> Chiramisu: and how do you manage to solve the problem?
[13:22:19] <Chiramisu> Ah yes, good ol' Scott :)
[13:22:36] <Chiramisu> He's a smart cookie... I aspire to be on his level :P
[13:22:55] <ccmonster> oh my. js fiddle will be a problem because of the pushState stuff I believe.
[13:23:04] <Chiramisu> It turned out I was parsing the wrong element SoulRaven.
[13:23:05] <brettgoulder> ah
[13:23:06] <dreinull_> aaanyway, I still cant ajax my url. $.ajax(("/url/" + value) for some reason doesn't work.
[13:23:06] <brettgoulder> link?
[13:23:09] <ccmonster> yea one sec.
[13:23:11] <doubletap> Mootools!
[13:23:36] <Chiramisu> After work I could take a look at your code, but wouldn't be appropriate on company time I think. I'm working on own issues. Sorry mate :(
[13:24:06] <SoulRaven> Chiramisu: if you have the time, look please on my code, http://jsfiddle.net/NAPCF/2/
[13:24:35] <SoulRaven> each letter is on diferent row, on a separate li
[13:26:35] <Chiramisu> First off SoulRaven, I would recommend examining what's in your "cache[ term ]" using Firebug or something.
[13:26:50] <Chiramisu> I found that my issue was in the source, inside the "response"
[13:29:14] <ccmonster> good to hear Chiramisu
[13:30:40] <aaronmcadam> guyd
[13:30:57] <aaronmcadam> anyone know how to use bot-t on a private freenode channel
[13:31:15] <SoulRaven> Chiramisu: nothing here, in all the places, the return text is ok, i can't find where the response is separated by letter and appended
[13:33:09] <aaronmcadam> status bot-t
[13:33:13] <aaronmcadam> ?bot
[13:33:13] <bot-t> sentient but living in the machine locale.
[13:33:33] <aaronmcadam> anyone?
[13:35:16] <imsky> ror
[13:35:38] <SoulRaven> if with console.log on the lastXhr, the response text is like this: responseTest: ""Pitesti""
[13:35:42] <SoulRaven> is fine like that?
[13:36:22] <Chiramisu> SoulRaven, I'm not using cache, but my response line looks something like this__ response($("select#sourceList").children("option"));
[13:37:29] <SoulRaven> and if you look on the lastXhr, that is the format on the responseTest: from the object?
[13:37:32] <Chiramisu> where my "sourceList" is an ASP.NET DropDownList control.
[13:37:55] <SoulRaven> console.log(lastXhr);
[13:38:07] <Chiramisu> Sorry mate, I'd love to help more, but I gotta focus on work :(
[13:38:20] <pjdelport> ahoy
[13:38:59] <pjdelport> i have a question for any users of the jQuery Form plugin <http://jquery.malsup.com/form/>
[13:40:08] <pjdelport> jquery.load() has a feature where you can optionally specify a fragment of the loaded page to use as the replacement on its target
[13:40:37] <pjdelport> e.g. foo.load('my/resource #body')
[13:40:58] <pjdelport> does jQuery Form support anything equivalent?
[13:41:47] <chrislabeard> is there a way to count divs and assign them a numbered class?
[13:42:06] <pjdelport> or is there a way to get it to to asynchronously submit a form "in-place"?
[13:43:56] <opie_> chrislabeard: yeah one sec
[13:44:26] <donburks> chrislabeard: Yes. Make a counter variable. Start it at 1. Then do $("div").each(function() { $(this).addClass('div-'+counter); counter++; });
[13:44:50] <chrislabeard> awesome let me try that out

[13:47:19] <donburks> opie: Nice, using the index.
[13:47:28] <opie_> busted =)
[13:47:30] <Brodingo> jnh im sorry i read that wrong, yes it is impossible
[13:47:34] <chrislabeard> niice
[13:47:43] <Brodingo> as it has no unit values to animate between
[13:47:52] <jnh> Brodingo: ahh. okay, then I guess I need to hax with opacity then :)
[13:48:04] <Brodingo> indeed
[13:48:11] <Brodingo> perhaps with css
[13:48:15] <kborchers> jnh: "The .animate() method allows us to create animation effects on any numeric CSS property. "
[13:48:24] <donburks> You can animate Opacity. Otherwise, fadeIn and fadeOut wouldn't work.

[13:50:23] <Ankabout> I want to wrap thw link on line 5 around the element on line 13
[13:50:29] <Ankabout> using jquery
[13:50:32] <jnh> kborchers: thanks.
[13:50:39] <Ankabout> should be the exact same link, same classes, etc.
[13:50:39] <kborchers> np
[13:52:37] <Chiramisu> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
[13:52:42] <opie_> ? wrap @ Ankabout
[13:52:42] <bot-t> Ankabout, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/

[13:52:52] <Chiramisu> TEARS OF JOY... TEARS OF JOY!!!
[13:52:57] <Chiramisu> I FINALLY figured it out.
[13:52:59] <Chiramisu> WOOOT!!
[13:53:16] <opie_> Ankabout: you may need to also use .clone() but the wrap function was designed to wrap elements with content
[13:53:40] <ccmonster> good to hear. What was it :)
[13:53:54] <Chiramisu> ccmonster, it was the silliest thing. All I needed to do was add the parameter "autoFocus: true" to my autocomplete. *CRY*!
[13:54:07] <ccmonster> haha!
[13:54:15] <ccmonster> those are hard earned tears :)
[13:54:29] <Brodingo> and now youll never make that mistake again
[13:54:30] <Chiramisu> Oh my gosh, after probably almost 8 hours of troubleshooting. I'm seriously SO HAPPY!
[13:54:31] <ccmonster> digest all the available events when you use those Ui plugins. There's handy stuff in there.
[13:54:33] <ateam> ccmonster: hey it's working, i used the filter function and then i had access to the #soso object where i cand grab the innerHTML...http://pastie.org/2346878 anyway thx for the help !
[13:54:42] <Chiramisu> OH GOODNESS NO Brodingo, lol
[13:54:45] <Chiramisu> NEVER AGAIN, haha
[13:54:49] <ccmonster> haha.
[13:55:02] <ccmonster> I got my history thing working finally. although with a few kinks but its working
[13:55:11] <Ankabout> opie_, so I'd probably copy the element into a variable, and then wrap that around?
[13:55:15] <Ankabout> ? clone
[13:55:15] <bot-t> .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[13:55:23] <opie_> Ankabout: that's what i was thinking
[13:55:31] <chrislabeard> opie_: one thing is it possible to make it restart count after a specific number?
[13:55:56] <Chiramisu> I'm gonna go hi-five my boss now, haha
[13:56:03] <opie_> Ankabout: only thing is that after clone the element you may need to strip the inner content out
[13:56:10] <Chiramisu> Grats ccmonster :)
[13:56:19] <opie_> Ankabout: so that you don't wrap the original <img> tag up inside the other image tag? ya know?
[13:56:29] <Ankabout> yeah haha makes sense
[13:56:52] <ccmonster> .close().wrap() or even prepend() depending on your scenario
[13:57:04] <ccmonster> clone*
[13:57:06] <opie_> chrislabeard: yeah, just use donburks example and keep track in your own counter, using something like mod or %
[13:57:08] <ccmonster> god im braindead and cant type

[13:59:19] <opie_> ohh, it'll work
[13:59:36] <chrislabeard> haha
[13:59:50] <chrislabeard> jQuery is the same thing as "$" right?
[13:59:54] <opie_> yeah
[14:00:17] <chrislabeard> man I love jquery
[14:02:54] <Brodingo> Ankabout http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/JtbP4/
[14:03:16] <Ankabout> Brodingo, AWESOME!
[14:03:20] <Ankabout> thanks!!
[14:03:33] <Brodingo> yw
[14:03:34] <opie_> ahh .empty() tou che Brodingo
[14:06:17] <jnh> more of a css question, but if I have a parent element set to opacity 0 and a child element with opacity 1 the child element doesn't appear, is there a way to make this work?
[14:06:48] <Brodingo> jnh working as intended
[14:07:28] <donburks> Take the child element out of the parent element.
[14:07:47] <jnh> Brodingo: right. I get that. what I'm trying to do is have a featured image in the center of the page and have the rest of the page fade in around it.
[14:09:44] <sk8ball> what would be the best plugin for doing a text slideshow
[14:10:33] <sk8ball> just something simple to cycle through text slides w/ a little transition effect
[14:11:16] <ryanneufeld> donburks: hi
[14:11:16] <bot-t> (5 hours 11 mins ago) <ajpiano> tell ryanneufeld [11:51:37] jzaefferer is considering a tool like this for and adapting for the jQuery style guide? https://github.com/einars/js-beautify, let us know your thoughts :)
[14:11:57] <donburks> ryanneufeld: Hey
[14:14:31] <donburks> sk8ball: Check out http://wex.im/
[14:14:53] <donburks> If that doesn't work....try google.
[14:15:23] <Vinny> Hey anyone work with pushstates?
[14:15:40] <ryanneufeld> bot-t tell ajpiano that's great! I love it, One thing it needs is the whitespace around parens
[14:17:29] <ryanneufeld> ?jquerybbq @ Vinny
[14:17:30] <bot-t> Vinny, jQuery BBQ: Back Button & Query Library | jQuery Plugins - jQuery BBQ leverages the hashchange event to allow simple, yet powerful bookmarkable #hash history. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full .deparam() method, along with both hash state management,... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ba-jquery-bbq-plugin
[14:17:46] <chrislabeard> opie_ the counter works perfectly but it might need to restart once it gets to the end of the </ol> and start over is that possible?
[14:19:16] <Vinny> ryanneufeld: so this just does a pushstate for html5- browsers?
[14:20:38] <ryanneufeld> Vinny, it provides a cross browser pushstate
[14:20:42] <Vinny> ryanneufeld: ah i see nvm thanks for the reference!
[14:20:43] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure if it wraps the native
[14:20:57] <Vinny> ryanneufeld: but it utilizes the # fragments still right? pushstate doesn't do #ing ?
[14:21:08] <ryanneufeld> not sure
[14:21:15] <ryanneufeld> first thing that came to my mind when you asked
[14:21:51] <diverdude> Hello, I am updating text in a span-field using jquery. I would like to clear the field again after 2 seconds. How can i do this?
[14:22:06] <Vinny> ryanneufeld: yeah cause I was thinking what a storage method would be to have other than #ing
[14:22:31] <ryanneufeld> you want localstorage then
[14:22:45] <ryanneufeld> are you storing data? or trying to modify the history?
[14:22:58] <donburks> diverdude: setTimeout(function() { $("#yourspan").empty(); }, 2000);
[14:23:12] <donburks> Or set .text('');
[14:23:14] <ryanneufeld> if you're wanting to store data, then amplify.js is a great abstraction layer
[14:23:15] <Vinny> ryanneufeld:  history specific, so if i do 5 ajax calls i can iterate through each call
[14:23:31] <ryanneufeld> Pushstate isn't fully supported yet
[14:23:32] <aaronmcadam> ah i saw that yea
[14:24:12] <ryanneufeld> Vinny: I'm not certain, but I think jquerybbq used pushstate if it's there, and falls back to fragments after
[14:25:06] <ryanneufeld> Vinny: I could be mistaken though
[14:25:25] <Vinny> ryanneufeld: yeah that sounds like the ticket, i was just curious if it was possible to have a class store the history without fragments pre-html5
[14:25:35] <ryanneufeld> no
[14:26:14] <Dirkos> Im updating a youtube movie resource using jquery like: $('#youtubeobject object param[name=movie]').attr('src', 'http://www.youtube.com/v/'+code+'?showinfo=1&amp;fs=1');
[14:26:25] <Dirkos> thing is that in IE 7-8-9 the movie wont show or anything
[14:26:43] <donburks> Dirkos: I've found that won't work. I typically remove and re-write the object tag to accomplish that.
[14:26:59] <ryanneufeld> Vinny: the only way you can do that is with localstorage, or cookies if localstorage isn't an option
[14:27:00] <Dirkos> hmm sucks haha
[14:27:11] <donburks> Actually, it's not that bad.
[14:27:12] <amid_hasan> Trying to toggle some table rows that include the "parent" id http://jsfiddle.net/DbAvL/5/  Any ideas?
[14:28:09] <donburks> amid_hasan: Your markup is broken. That's likely part of your problem.
[14:28:30] <amid_hasan> donburks: thats why i need your help..
[14:28:47] <donburks> I'll help with the jQuery. Building tables is up to you. :)
[14:29:03] <amid_hasan> How do I toggle the parent of something?
[14:29:22] <ryanneufeld> amid_hasan: the syntax highlghting is telling you why it's broken, click the tidyup button
[14:29:25] <ryanneufeld> once you get your markup right
[14:29:27] <Dirkos> donburks: maybe thats the reason Youtube uses iframes nowadays :) with iframe it works normally though
[14:29:33] <ryanneufeld> jquery will work better for you
[14:29:58] <donburks> Dirkos: Well, either way, you're rewriting the whole object, whether it's an <object> or an <iframe>
[14:29:59] <aaronw-1> I think you want this.toggle() or something
[14:30:19] <Dirkos> donburks: not needed, can just update the src at the iframe
[14:30:28] <donburks> Dirkos: Ah, I see what you mean. Okay.
[14:30:40] <Dirkos> wouldnt work at the object itself though :)
[14:30:58] <kborchers> amid_hasan: http://jsfiddle.net/DbAvL/7/
[14:32:02] <ryanneufeld> amid_hasan: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/DbAvL/8/
[14:39:51] <jnh> is there a way to tell if an image is already loaded?
[14:40:43] <xenyz> Anyone familiar with superfish & supersubs? I'm trying to make a two-column submenu without css hacks
[14:41:16] <xenyz> If you want to see it with css hacks: http://jsfiddle.net/WRpd8/
[14:41:48] <xenyz> The problem is, if you go to the first menu, first submenu the super subs don't take effect :/
[14:42:22] <orplac> question: whats the jquery function to return a specifc value out of an array based on index number
[14:42:31] <orplac> or element posistion, NOT dom related
[14:42:43] <xenyz> So I'm trying to find a way to apply double the width to sub ul's and half the width to the li's
[14:42:55] <donburks> orplac: .get()
[14:43:05] <orplac> donburks: thanks man, +1
[14:45:32] <pjdelport> it doesn't look like jQuery Form can extract a target page fragment like i need it to, so i'm trying to roll my own asynchronous submission using .submit and .load
[14:46:14] <pjdelport> so far so good, but for serializeArray(), i need to include the successful submit button as part of the form submission
[14:46:32] <pjdelport> jQuery by default omits it
[14:46:34] <chrislabeard> How do you make an active link background slide to the next active link when clicked?
[14:46:51] <pjdelport> is there a way from the jQuery submit event handler to find out which button triggered it?
[14:47:27] <imsky> chrislabeard: http://www.gmarwaha.com/blog/2007/08/23/lavalamp-for-jquery-lovers/
[14:49:18] <chrislabeard> imsky: awesome thank you

[14:51:41] <BaconJuice> hey guys
[14:52:13] <ccmonster> hiya
[14:52:23] <BaconJuice> hi ccmonster!
[14:52:29] <BaconJuice> could you help me with some code?
[14:53:03] <ccmonster> just ask...
[14:53:06] <BaconJuice> https://gist.github.com/1135131
[14:53:07] <ccmonster> ?demo is possible
[14:53:08] <bot-t> ccmonster, Plugins/Autocomplete - Autocomplete an input field to enable users quickly finding and selecting some value, leveraging searching and filtering. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/autocomplete
[14:53:39] <BaconJuice> what I want to do is store each title tags value into different div ids
[14:53:42] <BaconJuice> how do I do this?
[14:54:03] <BaconJuice> an example code if possible ccmonster ..im new to this =(
[14:54:22] <ccmonster> close the success: function(response){handleResponse(response);}
[14:55:11] <BaconJuice> ah ok will do
[14:55:31] <BaconJuice> but how would I do the ajax/xml problem?
[14:56:02] <ccmonster> whats the problem..
[14:56:05] <BaconJuice> I want to save the first title values in the <h3 id="rome_collapse">=(</h3>
[14:56:20] <BaconJuice> the second title value in the <h3 id="florance_collapse">=(</h3>
[14:56:24] <chrislabeard> imsky do you know of one that only moves when clicked? Instead of the hover and click?
[14:56:50] <ccmonster> BaconJuice, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1022080/jquery-xml-parsing-traversing
[14:56:59] <imsky> chrislabeard: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/how-to-build-a-lava-lamp-style-navigation-menu/
[14:57:08] <imsky> where they talk about the hover event, you can just swap it for click
[14:57:14] <ccmonster> chroslabeard, is that you chrisbovard?
[14:57:21] <chrislabeard> nope
[14:57:28] <chrislabeard> just me a guy chris with a beard
[14:57:45] <pjdelport> anyone? is it possible to find out which button / input control triggered a form with jQuery?
[14:57:55] <imsky> not without paying me
[14:58:15] <BaconJuice> ccmonster: I can not edit the given xml file =(
[14:58:16] <djQuery> pjdelport: sure just set a var one each of them
[14:59:19] <ccmonster> https://gist.github.com/1135301
[14:59:26] <BaconJuice> so I just want to save  <title>Rome, Italy.</title> in to  <h3 id="rome_collapse">=(</h3> and <title>Florence, Italy. </title> into <h3 id="florance_collapse">=(</h3>
[15:00:06] <djQuery> pjdelport: $('input[type="submit"]').click(funciton(){  $this).closest('form').data('buttonname', this.name);  }); $('form').submit(function(){ console.log($(this).data('buttonname');  });
[15:00:17] <ccmonster> find them
[15:00:43] <BaconJuice> how is my question? how do I go into the specific element?
[15:00:45] <djQuery> pjdelport: or you can look through event and find the original even to see what triggered it.
[15:01:24] <BaconJuice> title1 = xmlDoc.getElementsByTagName("title")[0]; like this thru non jquery method right?
[15:01:26] <ccmonster> do your find.
[15:01:28] <pjdelport> djQuery: haha, the data method will work i guess :)
[15:01:33] <BaconJuice> but how do I do it with jquery
[15:01:37] <ccmonster> do the each, like you are
[15:01:47] <ccmonster> then save the .attr('title') to a variable
[15:01:51] <pjdelport> djQuery: how would i get to the original element via the event?
[15:02:02] <ccmonster> then replace the h3 with the var you saved your title into
[15:02:03] <BaconJuice> but won't each just save all the title values into the variable?
[15:02:14] <BaconJuice> so h3 with first id will have ALL titles
[15:02:17] <pjdelport> if that's possible, it's probably the better way, i assume
[15:02:18] <BaconJuice> not just the first title
[15:02:27] <ccmonster> You only want the FIRST title every time?
[15:02:34] <BaconJuice> no
[15:02:39] <djQuery> pjdelport: $('form').submit(function(event){  console.log(event);   /*look at this in console. */  });
[15:02:41] <BaconJuice> I want it to increment
[15:02:43] <ccmonster> btw, LOL @ italian blowjobs
[15:02:55] <BaconJuice> haha
[15:02:55] <pjdelport> djQuery: cool, one sec
[15:03:15] <BaconJuice> if I do each() it will write every title into the one variable
[15:03:17] <ccmonster> so for each title, you want to output a div that looks like those you have in the gist?
[15:03:24] <BaconJuice> exactly
[15:03:27] <ccmonster> ok.
[15:03:35] <BaconJuice> so like <title>Rome, Italy.</title>
[15:03:48] <BaconJuice> goes into <h3 id="rome_collapse">=(</h3>
[15:03:55] <djQuery> BaconJuice: see ?tmpl
[15:03:56] <bot-t> BaconJuice, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[15:04:08] <djQuery> hey bot came to work today
[15:04:11] <BaconJuice> <title>Florence, Italy. </title> goes into <h3 id="florance_collapse">=(</h3>
[15:04:11] <ccmonster> what djQuery said, or write it out with js
[15:04:12] <imsky> lol
[15:04:18] <ccmonster> yea, its been firing along pretty nicely.
[15:04:54] <ccmonster> the issue is, youve got nothing that tells us rome_collapse should be the id of a xml item with the title "Rome, Italy"
[15:05:10] <ccmonster> whats the standard there.
[15:05:18] <djQuery> BaconJuice: are u using xml?
[15:05:24] <BaconJuice> yes I am
[15:05:28] <imsky> baconxml
[15:05:31] <BaconJuice> xD
[15:05:37] <pjdelport> djQuery: hmm, nothing is jumping out at me
[15:05:37] <djQuery> BaconJuice: dont think that .tmpl works with xml.
[15:05:39] <BaconJuice> I can't edit the xml file
[15:05:49] <djQuery> ?xmltojson
[15:05:49] <ccmonster> ok. so you have to work with it
[15:05:49] <bot-t> djQuery, XML to JSON | jQuery Plugins - IMPORTANT: This project will not be maintained on this system. Please visit the official website for the latest download files and support: http://www.fyneworks.com/jquery/xml-to-json/ http://plugins.jquery.com/project/xml2json
[15:05:57] <BaconJuice> yep
[15:05:59] <ccmonster> yea, xmltojson is solid. i've used it
[15:06:09] <pjdelport> all the event src/target properties seem to point at the HTMLFormElement itself
[15:06:10] <BaconJuice> can't use json either
[15:06:24] <pjdelport> none at any particular input control
[15:06:32] <ccmonster> well, then you want to grab everything before the ',' in the title, so rome, lowercase it, then append "_collapsable"
[15:06:39] <ccmonster> WHAT? can't use json?
[15:06:42] <djQuery> BaconJuice: you get the xml the same way you are now then xmltojson it the apply a .tmpl to it.
[15:06:45] <ccmonster> this is just the json representation
[15:06:52] <ccmonster> he is talking about
[15:07:23] <djQuery> pjdelport: http://jsbin.com/ememef/edit#javascript,html,live    stuff you can do with tmpl
[15:07:44] <djQuery> oops BaconJuice^^^^6
[15:08:42] <BaconJuice> djQuery this is actually an assignment im working on..well this little part is holding me back
[15:08:43] <ccmonster> btw BaconJuice do you need to use the package title?
[15:08:50] <ccmonster> or you just need the <title></title>?
[15:09:07] <BaconJuice> basically I can not use anything other than the basic jquery ajax and the given xml
[15:09:21] <ccmonster> Is this for a class? lol
[15:09:23] <BaconJuice> ccmonster as long as I can do what I told before
[15:09:37] <ccmonster> I'm saying, do you need the "italian blowjobs' in your html anywhere?
[15:09:45] <BaconJuice> yep
[15:09:50] <ccmonster> ok, i dont see where in your html
[15:10:02] <BaconJuice> oh sorry I removed it to make it clear and easier to read
[15:10:22] <BaconJuice> but it gets shown on a id called "#package"
[15:10:26] <donburks> Where DON'T you need Italian blowjobs?
[15:10:49] <BaconJuice> don't worry about the Italian blowjobs part
[15:11:03] <donburks> That was my favourite part!
[15:11:10] <BaconJuice> all I want to do is <title>Florence, Italy. </title> goes into <h3 id="florance_collapse">=(</h3>
[15:11:31] <ccmonster> ok
[15:11:34] <BaconJuice> not the whole three title tags
[15:11:49] <BaconJuice> when I do .each() basically ALLL the title tags go into it
[15:11:50] <BaconJuice> =(
[15:12:02] <BaconJuice> I can show you guys what I mean? want me to do the edit to show?
[15:12:04] <ccmonster> then you do a .each and write out the html from there
[15:12:09] <BaconJuice> or do you get what I mean?
[15:12:16] <Chiramisu> Can someone please explain to me in a nutshell what is the difference between__ "(function ($) {} )(jQuery);" AND "$(function(){ });"
[15:12:29] <ccmonster> have you used jsfiddle.net BaconJuice ? You should.
[15:12:52] <ccmonster> Different encapsulation.
[15:12:55] <ccmonster> ?...?
[15:13:01] <bot-t> ccmonster, jQuery API - Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/
[15:13:09] <Chiramisu> How so?
[15:13:26] <ccmonster> the ..? was sort of me saying..."shoulder shrug I dunno exactly"
[15:13:43] <donburks> Chiramisu: The first one is an iife. Immediately Invoked Function Expression. The second is a jQuery document.ready.
[15:13:53] <Chiramisu> I understand that $(function() { }); is the shortcut for document.ready, but what's the other form?
[15:14:18] <ccmonster> ah||, ok, i used that in my revleaing module pattern that someone showed me.
[15:14:20] <donburks> One will run immediately, as soon as the browser parser sees it. The second only runs when the browser fires the onready event and associated processing which jQuery looks for before triggering doc.ready
[15:14:33] <Chiramisu> Ah... I think I get it. Thanks donburks :)
[15:14:52] <djQuery> are they any different than catholic ones?
[15:15:16] <Mnkras-Laptop> can someone tell me why bgRow.css('background','url('+escape(thumbPath)+') no-repeat left top');
[15:15:16] <Mnkras-Laptop> [10:05pm]
[15:15:18] <ccmonster> ahah
[15:15:26] <Mnkras-Laptop> is producing
[15:15:39] <Mnkras-Laptop> style="padding-left: 100px; background-image: url(http://c5/files/thumbnails/9112/8536/9025/inneroptics_dot_net_canyonlands.jpg); background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: 0% 0%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; "
[15:15:44] <Mnkras-Laptop> ?
[15:15:49] <ccmonster> css gets writen out.
[15:16:07] <Mnkras-Laptop> umm
[15:16:08] <donburks> Mnkras-Laptop: The problem will be in your thumbPath variable.
[15:16:14] <wallerdev> can someone explain to me how the mouseenter event is defined in jQuery, having trouble reading through the source
[15:16:17] <Mnkras-Laptop> why?
[15:16:26] <ccmonster> because it does? lol i dunno.
[15:16:32] <Mnkras-Laptop> heh
[15:16:39] <Mnkras-Laptop> thats… retarded?
[15:16:51] <Mnkras-Laptop> donburks: ?
[15:16:53] <ccmonster> use Classes where possible for that stuff. Let CSS do its thing and just addClass , removeClass
[15:17:00] <ccmonster> i could be wrong on this man.
[15:17:22] <donburks> Mnkras-Laptop: It looks like your thumbPath variable is writing out http://c5/files blahblah. Which is fine, if your machine has a local alias to c5 in its hosts file.
[15:17:25] <ccmonster> BaconJuice, you good or what?
[15:17:27] <donburks> Otherwise that's not a FQDN.
[15:17:39] <Mnkras-Laptop> donburks: it does
[15:17:40] <Mnkras-Laptop> :P
[15:17:52] <Mnkras-Laptop> the url is fine
[15:18:06] <Mnkras-Laptop> going bonkers with some of this code,
[15:18:19] <donburks> Oh, then your only issue is that you're looking at the full set of CSS properties being rendered out. background is a shortcut in CSS for background-color background-image background-position background-attachment.
[15:18:32] <Mnkras-Laptop> mhm,
[15:18:36] <Mnkras-Laptop> just kinda weird
[15:18:56] <BaconJuice> ccmonster: no dude =(
[15:19:03] <BaconJuice> im on the edge of giving up
[15:19:37] <BaconJuice> can't I access it thru like an array element? like (title)[0] gives me the first one etc etc
[15:21:09] <ccmonster> yes.
[15:21:12] <ccmonster> im not sure what your issue is
[15:21:57] <ccmonster> it's pretty straight forward.
[15:24:18] <ccmonster> BaconJuice, make a jsfiddle
[15:26:05] <pjdelport> djQuery: thanks for the direction!
[15:26:26] <djQuery> pjdelport: North?
[15:27:07] <pjdelport> djQuery: got it working now; but instead of setting variables like that, i just made the submit controls add a extra hidden input copying their name/value
[15:29:30] <pjdelport> $('... form :submit').live('click', function (evt) { $('<input type="hidden">').attr({name: this.name, value: this.value}).appendTo($(this).closest('form')); });
[15:29:36] <pjdelport> hack hack hack :)

[15:34:47] <pjdelport> ok! one last hurdle
[15:35:22] <pjdelport> if the load returns a 302, i want to redirect the whole page
[15:35:55] <pjdelport> instead of loading it into the target element
[15:36:43] <donburks> pjdelport: Are you requesting with ajax?
[15:37:52] <pjdelport> donburks: yeah; i'm making some form exchanges work inside an overlay
[15:37:55] <xenyz> in a super fish callback I want to test if this (the ul being opened) is in a certain level. something like:  if (this == '.sf-menu>ul>li>ul' {
[15:38:27] <xenyz> http://jsfiddle.net/WRpd8/1/
[15:38:28] <ccmonster> BaconJuice, ??
[15:38:39] <xenyz> (look for onBeforeShow
[15:38:52] <pjdelport> donburks: i was hoping jQuery Forms already supported doing it, but as far as i can tell it doesn't support the page fragment loading shortcut that .load() does
[15:39:16] <donburks> Ahh, I see.
[15:40:45] <pjdelport> donburks: i had to work around the fact that jQuery's .serializeArray() doesn't include the successful submit control, which is required for some of the forms to work
[15:40:54] <pjdelport> (preview versus save, etc.)
[15:41:51] <pjdelport> now, i assume i'll need to add a complete() handler to the .load() call
[15:41:56] <donburks> Ohh, I see now. Okay.
[15:42:10] <pjdelport> which checks the status for 302 and handles it appropriately
[15:42:21] <pjdelport> but which lets load() do its thing otherwise
[15:43:25] <pjdelport> hmm
[15:44:03] <pjdelport> the documentation says that .load() calls its callback after the target element contents has already been set
[15:44:43] <pjdelport> but for the 302 after a successful form process, i actually want to intercept it before that happens
[15:45:06] <dabear> pjdelport: then use $.ajax directly, instead of one of the wrappers
[15:46:15] <donburks> pjdelport: I agree with dabear. If you can, use straight .ajax. Then you have .ajaxError().
[15:50:31] <xenyz> alright you heifers, thanks for not helping me, but you helped me anyway. :P
[15:50:47] <xenyz> Here it is: super fish menu with super subs and a double column sub menu! http://jsfiddle.net/WRpd8/2/
[15:51:10] <xenyz> and no css hacks :)
[15:56:29] <bricker> is there a jquery plugin for things like fornat tags and smilies in forms?
[15:59:28] <warreng> what are the best libraries for building client-side apps (creating DOM elements and views/layouts, routing via the url #hash, models backed by remote json data, etc)?
[16:00:04] <ajpiano> warreng: backbone.js
[16:00:21] <ajpiano> there's also sproutcore and spinejs and knockoutjs
[16:00:22] <ajpiano> etc
[16:02:10] <Kzim> hey
[16:03:13] <Kzim> is there a way to load images at the same time. i mean i have many image to load and first it wait for the javascript to end a process and than load image one by one. is there a way to speed p that plz
[16:04:33] <grid_> does anyone got a jquery example script that will change the adressbar when external content will load, it should also be able to request the jquery script from the adressbar, when you do this the page must keep alife, i found something like this http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-basic/ but here the content is already in the html with a css hide style
[16:21:14] <chrislabeard> how can I make this be the same for each one? http://jsfiddle.net/wvGju/
[16:21:25] <chrislabeard> I need it to count each li in an ol and give it a div
[16:21:43] <chrislabeard> I mean div class
[16:23:11] <donburks> chrislabeard: Not sure I'm understanding what you're asking for, above and beyond what you already have.
[16:23:42] <chrislabeard> donburks: well instead of it counting to 4 and then starting over, would it be possible to get it to count the li's just incase 1 list doesn't have 4 items?
[16:26:10] <donburks> chrislabeard: Before you get into your each, you'll want to do a .length of the li's that are found, and set that in a variable that you can reference inside of the each.
[16:27:03] <chrislabeard> alright so that would replace the index?
[16:27:57] <donburks> Well, you're not using the index right now anyway.
[16:28:09] <donburks> It would replace the '4' in the last line of your each.
[16:29:50] <chrislabeard> donburks: hmmm, its only doing the first ol -- http://jsfiddle.net/wvGju/1/
[16:31:17] <grid_> does anyone got a jquery example script that will change the adressbar when external content will load, it should also be able to request the jquery script from the adressbar
[16:31:24] <grid_> when you do this the page must keep alife, i found something like this http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-basic/ but here the content is already in the html with a css hide style, i need to get it when i push a link (because i load links that will cause sounds)
[16:32:52] <Mnkras-Laptop> I need some help,
[16:33:06] <Mnkras-Laptop> I know the code is horrible
[16:33:07] <Mnkras-Laptop> https://raw.github.com/concrete5/concrete5/master/web/concrete/js/ccm.dialog.js
[16:33:23] <Mnkras-Laptop> for some reason after the initial page load,
[16:33:25] <donburks> chrislabeard: http://jsfiddle.net/donburks/ycXhv/
[16:33:49] <Mnkras-Laptop> adding the class .dialog-launch is not affecting links (should open a dialog)
[16:37:10] <donburks> Mnkras-Laptop: A jQueryUI dialog?
[16:37:35] <Mnkras-Laptop> nope
[16:37:37] <donburks> chrislabeard: Is that working for you?
[16:37:52] <Mnkras-Laptop> this was made before jqueryUI existed
[16:37:53] <Mnkras-Laptop> :P
[16:38:04] <chrislabeard> donburks: yeah its counting them all but I need it to just count the ones inside each ol. So like div1, div2, div3, div4 --- div1, div2.
[16:38:19] <chrislabeard> donburks: I hope I'm explaining it well
[16:38:21] <donburks> Mnkras-Laptop: That doesn't mean you're not trying to use it now. I see where you're using the .dialog() call...
[16:38:31] <Mnkras-Laptop> yea, this overrides it,
[16:38:45] <Mnkras-Laptop> it literally kills it ;)
[16:38:48] <Dagoat> Anyone who can talk .prop()? It's too new for the internet to have the info I'm looking for.
[16:38:52] <donburks> chrislabeard: Yeah, I think so...Isn't the one I sent you doing that?
[16:39:17] <chrislabeard> donburks: its counting them all so its going to div11
[16:39:17] <donburks> When I inspect, it has div0, div1, div2, and then the next one has the same thing.
[16:39:24] <chrislabeard> hmm
[16:39:32] <chrislabeard> maybe I opened the wrong one
[16:39:58] <chrislabeard> donburks: yeah its going to 11 on http://jsfiddle.net/donburks/ycXhv/
[16:40:38] <Mnkras-Laptop> donburks: it seems that jQuery.fn.dialog.load isn't called when added after the page is fully loaded, (I have some js add new html)
[16:41:25] <Dagoat> Basically I'm copying address info, and I want to find which state is selected in a dropdown and set another dropdown to that. Most of the .prop info I'm finding is for checkboxes
[16:41:55] <ajpiano> Dagoat: you use .val() for that
[16:41:58] <ajpiano> on the select box
[16:42:34] <donburks> chrislabeard: Not on mine. I just modified it, reload. I've got five li's in the last ol, and it stops at div4.
[16:42:47] <Dagoat> really? I'll give that a shot then... I took it that prop was aimed in that general direction.
[16:42:48] <chrislabeard> thats really weird
[16:42:59] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: did you get my tell from bot-t?
[16:43:31] <ajpiano> Dagoat: prop is for every single other DOM element property besides value which there has always been a helper method for explicitly
[16:44:10] <ryanneufeld> tell ajpiano that's great! I love it, One thing it needs is the whitespace around parens
[16:44:17] <ajpiano> oh
[16:44:23] <ajpiano> you didn't tell bot-t to do it right i don't think
[16:44:30] <ryanneufeld> I guess not
[16:44:31] <ryanneufeld> I fail
[16:44:41] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld, i think joern's planning to tweak it a bit more obvs
[16:44:51] <chrislabeard> donburks: welp, not sure what is going on but I can't get it to work
[16:45:12] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: yeah, I like it a lot so far, I think I'll see about adding it to a build script or something
[16:45:34] <dabear> ?tell dabear you are so cool!
[16:45:34] <bot-t> dabear, Okay.
[16:45:40] <dabear> hi people!
[16:45:40] <bot-t> (6 secs ago) <dabear> tell dabear you are so cool!
[16:45:50] <dabear> oh, how nice of you, bot-t
[16:45:52] <chrislabeard> its working in firefox
[16:45:55] <chrislabeard> ahh of course its chrome
[16:46:27] <ryanneufeld> chrislabeard: clear you cache
[16:46:33] <donburks> chrislabeard: What he said.
[16:46:39] <ryanneufeld> also, I'm seeing the same results on all my browsers
[16:46:50] <chrislabeard> donburks: I didn't think loading a new page would serv up the wrong script
[16:46:57] <chrislabeard> but yep
[16:46:59] <ryanneufeld> dabear: thx
[16:47:18] <donburks> I've modified it since I first pasted.
[16:47:41] <ryanneufeld> do you push to default when you mod it donburks?
[16:47:46] <donburks> Yup.
[16:47:51] <amitprakash> any idea why the jquery at http://jsfiddle.net/esXDk/ doesn't run ?
[16:47:52] <ryanneufeld> don't
[16:47:55] <ryanneufeld> That's why
[16:48:41] <Mnkras-Laptop> whats key 27?
[16:48:48] <Mnkras-Laptop> (keyboard letter)
[16:48:55] <ajpiano> escape
[16:49:09] <Mnkras-Laptop> ah
[16:49:16] <Mnkras-Laptop> thanks
[16:49:34] <ryanneufeld> amitprakash: you're not loading jquery that's why
[16:49:35] <dabear> amitprakash: external urls are not supported in ajax
[16:50:02] <amitprakash> dabear, so ajax cannot make cross domain requests?
[16:50:08] <dabear> correct
[16:50:24] <ryanneufeld> amitprakash: also, your html is sloooppy
[16:50:25] <dabear> unless you use jsonp
[16:50:29] <ryanneufeld> you need to proper close your tags
[16:50:44] <amitprakash> ryanneufeld, I do :(
[16:51:34] <ryanneufeld> amitprakash: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/esXDk/2/
[16:51:35] <amitprakash> dabear, from the results I see that cross domain requests do work
[16:51:45] <amitprakash> ryanneufeld, and yes.. closing the </script> fixed it.. thanks
[16:51:55] <ryanneufeld> that's a better way to use jsfiddle, since your html isn't need for that demo
[16:51:56] <ryanneufeld> :)
[16:52:03] <ryanneufeld> the syntax highlighting is your friend
[16:52:13] <ryanneufeld> so is the "tidy up" button
[16:52:20] <amitprakash> I was actually just using fbug console :P wrote out the tags for jsfiddle
[16:52:29] <ryanneufeld> haha
[16:53:08] <amitprakash> ryanneufeld, hmm.. Accept in post header became undefined o.O
[16:53:25] <ryanneufeld> amitprakash: are you trying to upload a file?
[16:53:40] <amitprakash> no no.. trying to run an auth request with one game server
[16:53:45] <amitprakash> which I think uses REST
[16:54:01] <ryanneufeld> amitprakash: oic         contentType: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', <<-- why do you have this?
[16:54:08] <ryanneufeld> shouldn't be required
[16:55:12] <amitprakash> ryanneufeld, brilliant .. thanks a lot .. I'll read up on the accept header to see what is permitted
[16:55:48] <ryanneufeld> also, the domain you're attempting to authenticate against, might not allow for cross domain posts
[16:55:55] <ryanneufeld> ?sop
[16:55:55] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[16:56:02] <ryanneufeld> ?sop @ amitprakash
[16:56:02] <bot-t> amitprakash, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[16:56:37] <amitprakash> ryanneufeld, true .. but like $.getScript.. it can be bypassed as dabear said
[16:56:52] <ryanneufeld> not bypassed
[16:56:59] <ryanneufeld> just done differently
[16:57:07] <amitprakash> hmm
[16:57:09] <ryanneufeld> and they have to support it on their end
[16:57:17] <ryanneufeld> if they don't, you're just as screwed
[16:57:54] <pjdelport> dabear, donburks: i'm busy working on direct .ajax version of that form submission code
[16:58:59] <amitprakash> ryanneufeld, strangely though.. how can the ajax request mentioned there make the required calls?
[16:59:06] <pjdelport> i'm just nagged by the notion that someone must have needed this before, and that there must be a better version out there
[16:59:27] <ryanneufeld> which one is that?
[16:59:32] <donburks> pjdelport: You'll probably like it better in the end.
[17:00:00] <amitprakash> ryanneufeld, the one on jsfiddle u/i just wrote out?
[17:00:06] <pjdelport> donburks: well, i was hoping not to do too much wheel reinvention :)
[17:00:41] <pjdelport> http://jquery.malsup.com/form/  has much nicer file uploading handling and everything else, which i'm sacrificing
[17:01:07] <donburks> Well, why not hack the plugin then?
[17:01:07] <pjdelport> then .load() has built in fragment extraction etc. which i'm also sacrificing
[17:01:26] <donburks> Put new tires on the wheel you have instead of chiseling the wheel you don't.
[17:02:01] <pjdelport> i'll see if it's possible to extend it
[17:03:24] <pjdelport> ack, but jQuery Form probably doesn't have any result handling hook either
[17:04:07] <Taggnostr> I want to get the content of a div from another webpage and show it in a popup using jquery, is this possible? i.e. jquery should download the source of the other page, get the content of a div with a certain id and put it in a popup (like an "hover" popup, not a different window)
[17:04:18] <ajpiano> pjdelport: every single option you can pass to $.ajax you can pass to $.ajaxForm
[17:05:56] <donburks> Mmmm. It's going home time
[17:09:17] <madprops> do i need a plugin to validate email formats?
[17:09:53] <waerloga> madprops: short answer: no
[17:10:24] <coldhead> madprops: you could do it yourself and waste time on your own halfbaked implementation or you can rely on the hardwork and testing of others
[17:10:28] <coldhead> which is what plugins are for
[17:10:34] <coldhead> ^ long answer
[17:10:39] <waerloga> hehe
[17:10:50] <codepal> I want to move my All Mail label in gmail with .insertBefore() -- I've been trying to use a userscript --- http://pastebin.com/Xp32GgKb
[17:11:05] <codepal> any ideas?
[17:11:18] <zivester> can someone help me with this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/QUEuR/
[17:12:05] <zivester> woops, i have a typo: http://jsfiddle.net/QUEuR/1/
[17:12:52] <codepal> the id for "All Mail" - <div class="TO" id=":hs">
[17:14:49] <pjdelport> ajpiano: right, but the bit i'm actually after is .load()'s page fragment support
[17:15:58] <zivester> maybe a better question is can I run a selector on something not attached to the dom?
[17:17:46] <coldhead> i don't think so, zivester
[17:18:00] <coldhead> not unless you have a reference to it already
[17:18:15] <coldhead> $('input', someDetachedForm) would work
[17:18:43] <coldhead> zivester: i don't understand what your code is trying to do anyway. can you add some comments and name your function something more helpful than "doit"
[17:18:55] <coldhead> because all functions could be called "doit", really
[17:19:58] * coldhead np: fugazi - red medicine
[17:19:59] <zivester> i've taken out the unimportant part of "doit" that has no bearing on my question
[17:20:04] <dabear> yeah, it would really help if you could call your functions doit1 and doit2 instead
[17:20:18] <dabear> ;)
[17:20:22] <coldhead> doit1 and doit2 are the ackerman function i think
[17:20:37] <coldhead> ?w ackermann function
[17:20:38] <bot-t> coldhead, Ackermann function - In computability theory, the Ackermann function, named after Wilhelm Ackermann, is one of the simplest and earliest-discovered examples of a total computable function that is not primitive recursive. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function

[17:24:28] <pjdelport> bugger
[17:24:51] <pjdelport> so the browser is actually catching and handling the 302s before jQuery gets to see them
[17:24:59] <pjdelport> *that* puts a spanner in the works
[17:27:50] <zivester> http://jsfiddle.net/QUEuR/4/ is what i wanted to do... not entirely, but i guess it works
[17:28:40] <pjdelport> is there any workable way to detect redirects from jQuery / XHR?
[17:28:49] <pjdelport> Google is suggesting that there isn't
[17:32:40] <JHurry> I love Jquery, it's great when I need to hurry and throw together a bunch of sloppy code for a web app.

[17:40:04] <NeedOfHappiness> waerloga: Madonna's eyebrows are so sexy there.
[17:40:11] <NeedOfHappiness> ajpiano: What is it?
[17:40:14] <ajpiano> "query-rigging"
[17:40:44] <pjdelport> is there any way to determine if a certain XHR response was the result of a GET or POST?
[17:40:52] <NeedOfHappiness> What is query rigging ajpiano? I don't understand. :<

[18:28:03] <muay-guy> am I not using keyup properly?
[18:28:47] <coldhead> muay-guy: http://pastie.org/2347982
[18:28:47] <GeoDud> subtotal is calculated on ready() event not on keyup event
[18:29:01] <GeoDud> so it will always be the same no matter how many times the keyup is fired

[18:29:48] <coldhead> thanks GeoDud
[18:29:50] <coldhead> i try

[18:46:20] <jfelchner> So even though convention is that your JS files should be loaded at the bottom of the body tag, it seems like for document ready to function properly, jQuery needs to be loaded in the head tag.  Does anyone know if this is accurate?
[18:46:47] <Lochlan> I've loaded it at the bottom without troubles
[18:46:50] <coldhead> i believe that is inaccurate
[18:46:59] <coldhead> ready should run fine at the bottom
[18:47:08] <coldhead> but load jQuery before you use jquery, duh
[18:47:12] <Lochlan> ^
[18:48:28] <Lochlan> hey guys, I'm having a little trouble coming up with a selector that works for me. I don't usually ask but I've been trying a few combinations for a while now and don't seem to be having any luck
[18:48:58] <Lochlan> i have a div within a div, i need to check if the nested div is empty or not
[18:49:18] <Lochlan> div#direct > div#directView
[18:49:36] <coldhead> you shouldn't need to use the > because #directView should be unique
[18:49:36] <jfelchner> Thanks guys.  I'll keep plugging away at it.
[18:49:50] <Lochlan> yep, just put that there so you understand the order
[18:49:56] <coldhead> k
[18:50:01] <bfred> damn it. I remember coming across some plugin that made forms look great/usable just in the past week. anyone can point me to the right direction?
[18:50:38] <Lochlan> not sure of the exact one bfred, but if you google "jquery pretty forms" you'll probably find loads
[18:50:47] <tomoyuki28jp> How can I set specified only one class to a element? Not adding, just specifying one class name.
[18:51:13] <Lochlan> what do you mean tomoyuki28jp?
[18:51:56] <coldhead> ?filter @ tomoyuki28jp
[18:51:56] <bot-t> tomoyuki28jp, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[18:53:43] <Lochlan> So right now I'm using: if ($('#direct #directView:empty'))
[18:53:51] <Lochlan> doesn't seem to work, though
[18:54:32] <tomoyuki28jp> Lochlan: Making <div class="foo" /> to <div class="bar" /> in one sentence.
[18:55:04] <tomoyuki28jp> coldhead: filter isn't the one I'm looking for, I think.
[18:55:39] <tomoyuki28jp> Lochlan: $('.foo').addClass('bar') makes it <div class="foo bar" />, right?
[18:55:47] <Lochlan> you could do: $('foo').removeClass('foo').addClass('bar')  ?
[18:56:03] <tomoyuki28jp> Lochlan: I know that, but I thought there should be better way
[18:56:11] <Lochlan> ah
[18:56:16] <Lochlan> like a replaceClass function
[18:56:20] <Lochlan> or something
[18:56:22] <scorphus> aham
[18:56:29] <tomoyuki28jp> Lochlan: thanks
[18:56:43] <scorphus> oh, sorry =/
[18:56:54] <tomoyuki28jp> I thought there should be something like $('.foo').class('bar')
[18:57:58] <tomoyuki28jp> replaceClass works fine in my case.
[18:58:17] <Lochlan> replaceClass works?
[18:58:31] <tomoyuki28jp> Lochlan: in my case, yes
[18:58:46] <Lochlan> there's also a toggleClass you could try
[18:58:47] <Lochlan> if that suits
[18:58:57] <tomoyuki28jp> Lochlan: thanks a lot for your help!1
[18:59:08] <Lochlan> no worries
[18:59:17] <LettuceEngine> "Satan says drop small automobiles on tomoyuki28jp."
[18:59:49] <tomoyuki28jp> LettuceEngine: what do you mean?
[19:00:08] <tomoyuki28jp> Lochlan: Actually, there isn't such function: replaceClass
[19:00:29] <LettuceEngine> tomoyuki28jp: "Ever since he was a little boy, Satan wanted to be a British woman."
[19:00:35] <Lochlan> tomoyuki28jp: yeah, I didn't think so. There's probably a plugin. toggleClass might help
[19:00:50] <Lochlan> but i'd just chain it, if not
[19:01:28] <tomoyuki28jp> thanks > Lochlan
[19:01:52] <LettuceEngine> tomoyuki28jp: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GustaveDoreParadiseLostSatanProfile.jpg is Satan's porn.
[19:02:01] <miketaylr> yo LettuceEngine, shut yer trap
[19:02:23] <tomoyuki28jp> What the heck is that? Is that a bot?
[19:02:29] <miketaylr> some retard
[19:02:49] <tomoyuki28jp> :(
[19:02:53] <miketaylr> down syndrome bot, perhaps
[19:03:01] <LettuceEngine> "Satan says he loathes miketaylr's existence and would like him to disappear."
[19:03:30] <LettuceEngine> "Satan puts pernicious python programmers in miketaylr's mouth.
[19:03:47] <LettuceEngine> Stop.
[19:03:53] <miketaylr> yeah adio LettuceEngine
[19:03:56] <miketaylr> *adios
[19:04:29] <miketaylr> WHERES YOUR LUCIFER NOW
[19:07:12] <Lochlan> ffffffinally got it
[19:07:20] <Lochlan> $('#directView).is(':empty')
[19:07:23] <Lochlan> so obvious
[19:22:57] <bfred> Lochlan: CHOSEN: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[19:23:43] <Lochlan> nice one bfred
[19:23:47] <Lochlan> i think ive seen this recently too
[19:24:09] <Lochlan> bookmarked
[19:24:15] <bfred> best thing to do ;)
[19:24:15] <Lochlan> might use it in the project im working on
[19:24:23] <fris> bfred is that yours?
[19:24:38] <bfred> fris: no, just found it after a bit of research
[19:24:58] <bfred> it looks pretty nice and comprehensive
[19:30:19] <tomoyuki28jp> How can I do things like this? element.find('id').each(function() {}) Note: including all the it's children.
[19:30:54] <bfred> tomoyuki28jp:  .contents()
[19:31:13] <Lochlan> $.each($('#id'), function() {})   ?
[19:32:11] <tomoyuki28jp> Well, I wanna do something like this: row.find('id').each(function() { alert($(this).attr('id')) })
[19:32:35] <bfred> the ID should be unique
[19:32:41] <Lochlan> yeah, true
[19:32:44] <tomoyuki28jp> bfred: yeah
[19:32:46] <bfred> $('#id') will be enough
[19:32:58] <Lochlan> what i said, should do it
[19:33:05] <Lochlan> just swap #id for whatever selectors they are
[19:33:32] <bfred> $('selector').each(function(){…..}) will work as well
[19:33:54] <bfred> tomoyuki28jp: what are you trying to do?
[19:34:24] <pavan> Hello guys
[19:34:34] <bfred> pavan: oh, hi, beauty
[19:34:55] <pavan> How do I set a empty/null values to all children of a dom element
[19:34:57] <pavan> :)
[19:35:21] <tomoyuki28jp> bfred: clone and append <tr>...</tr> with form elements. It's form elements' ids are something like 'name_0' or 'name_1' and names are somethisn like 'name[0]' and 'name[1]'. I wanna replace the ids and names.
[19:35:30] <pavan> I mean to all imput elements
[19:36:01] <kborchers> pavan: $("element").find("input").val('');
[19:36:08] <bfred> tomoyuki28jp: aaaaah, let me know when you find a nice to do that...
[19:36:35] <tomoyuki28jp> kborchers: yeah, just find 'input' is nice way, thanks!
[19:36:46] <bfred> pavan: values? are you talking about form elements?
[19:37:54] <Lochlan> pavan: $('#element input').attr('value','');  <-- that do what you want?
[19:37:54] <pavan> yes, I have three tabs - each of them have multistep forms. When user switches between form or submits a form I want to reset the context to the begining in that tab
[19:38:55] <kborchers> Lochlan: that would only work if the inputs are direct children of the element and why not just use .val('') rather than attr?
[19:39:12] <Lochlan> kborchers, yea val, much better :)
[19:39:42] <Lochlan> still haven't commited all the selectors to memory
[19:39:57] <Lochlan> getting there
[19:40:15] <kborchers> sometimes i wish i could get them out of my head ;)
[19:41:09] <Lochlan> haha
[19:43:30] <pavan> any suggestions?  For example - I click on Tab2 and submit something and it display some content.  Then I cick on Tab1 and get back to Tab2 then it should ask for the input.
[19:43:58] <Lochlan> i thought we did suggest something
[19:44:57] <kborchers> pavan: i gave you something to try already ... $("element").find("input").val(''); where element is the div or what ever for the tab that you want to reset
[19:45:17] <pavan> ok thanks
[19:45:20] <pavan> let me try
[19:45:21] <Lochlan> kborchers, is .find used often? I rarely use it
[19:45:25] <kborchers> and if they're individual forms, you could use the id of the form you want to reset
[19:46:13] <kborchers> Lochlan: i try not to use it since it's expensive performance wise, but when you need to find something and don't know exactly where it is (multiple levels down in the dom), find works well
[19:46:29] <Lochlan> ok, sure
[19:46:57] <Lochlan> pavan: this may help too... $(':input','#myform').not(':button, :submit, :reset, :hidden').val('').removeAttr('checked').removeAttr('selected');
[19:47:10] <Lochlan> or some combination of both
[19:47:47] <kborchers> Lochlan: good call, resetting the value of submit for example would be bad since that would remove it's text
[19:48:43] <Lochlan> kborchers, so if an element is nested like so div#a > div#b > div#c
[19:48:59] <Lochlan> i couldnt target div#c with $('div#a div#c')
[19:49:06] <Lochlan> ignoring that im using IDs anyway
[19:49:59] <kborchers> hmmm, actually you're right, that should work
[19:50:08] <Lochlan> I thought so
[19:50:43] <kborchers> i was thinking $("#a > #c") would not work ... told you i need to get some selectors out of my head ;p
[19:50:58] <Lochlan> ah
[19:50:58] <Lochlan> yep
[19:58:39] <desaiu> I'm having difficulty, can someone help me? here's the site now: http://desaiu.github.com/
[19:58:57] <desaiu> I am going to upload the image, css, and js to demonstrate the problem
[19:59:44] <Lochlan> desaiu, do that, someone should be able to have a look
[20:01:05] <danheberden> desaiu jsfiddle.net is recommended, if you didn't already know
[20:04:45] <phoe6> Why is it in JQuery, do we have to write function() { } at all? For e.g I see $("img").click(function(){alert(this.src);}); as opposed to $("img").click(alert(this.src));
[20:04:54] <phoe6> why can't something be done within the DOM element's methods?
[20:05:16] <phoe6> and why is a function() { } ' wrapper' required?
[20:06:55] <kborchers> phoe6: because you are defining the function to be called when a click event occurs. if you had a function called foo that you wanted to call instead, you could say $("img").click(foo); and that would work as well. using an anonymous function is just another way of doing that without having to define the function elsewhere. make sense?
[20:07:40] <phoe6> yes, it is kind of callback.
[20:07:44] <phoe6> correct?
[20:08:05] <phoe6> I think, it i am thinking in terms of a design and if the Jquery'
[20:08:22] <phoe6> 's all purpose it to delegate it to callbacks, why not make it inline itself
[20:08:45] <darcyclarke> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work
[20:09:36] <phoe6> darcyclarke: thanks, I shall check it out.
[20:10:00] <kborchers> darcyclarke: thanks ... i was trying to think of an easy way to explain that but that does it nicely!
[20:10:38] <phoe6> btw, I do understand the concept of callbacks, but this wrapper thing is making me think a lot (leading towards why is it neccessary or is it some kind of a design decision).
[20:10:55] <darcyclarke> phoe6 I guess a more straight forward answer would be that you can't just throw in javascript into a function call, a func takes parameters not willy-nilly javascript. When you wrap your javascript in a function, it's like passing a parameter
[20:11:25] <chjj> ls
[20:11:29] <chjj> dammit
[20:11:29] <phoe6> darcyclarke: that makes perfect sense!
[20:11:33] <phoe6> thanks.

[20:23:03] <phoe6> What is a this kind of a format?  varname = (function($){} (JQuery));
[20:23:17] <phoe6> I assume the author is trying to do some namespace thing
[20:23:30] <phoe6> but I wonder how the RHS works?
[20:25:20] <johnsmithlll> hello, to get data from input i use obj.attr("value"); but what if i use <select> how do i get this <option> value?
[20:25:58] <kborchers> johnsmithlll: actuall, you should do obj.val() and that will work on select as well

[20:43:05] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[20:43:51] <abjorn> Hm, anyone got any suggestions for a js framework kinda like backbone except more lightweight? I have a project I think could benefit from a framework, but doesn't need so much
[20:44:04] <abjorn> o i suppose there's spine.js
[20:44:17] <Lochlan> im trying out knockoutjs at the moment with my project
[20:44:36] <abjorn> Ah, isn't that more of a ui framework though?
[20:44:45] <Lochlan> yeah, it is
[20:44:56] <abjorn> Yeah, I don't need something like that, just something for structuring my code
[20:45:08] <abjorn> I suppose I don't *need* a framework
[20:45:24] <abjorn> I've done more complex sites without one...it was kinda meh but I've done it
[20:45:26] <danheberden> lol, backbone isn't lightweight enough?
[20:45:30] <abjorn> nevr
[20:45:37] <danheberden> module pattern
[20:45:38] <abjorn> well really I just don't need the whole mvc thing
[20:45:38] <Lochlan> what's backbone do?
[20:45:45] <danheberden> write your own, dude
[20:45:48] <abjorn> yeah
[20:45:52] <danheberden> var app = {};
[20:45:54] <abjorn> lol
[20:45:58] <abjorn> yeah
[20:46:10] <danheberden> serious - just seperate your main logic, services - you'll be fine
[20:46:15] <abjorn> ya
[20:46:27] <abjorn> debating on whether I should use a script loader - probably not, I don't need that much
[20:46:55] <danheberden> yeah, most of the time a good concatenated minified gzipped hunk of shit is better
[20:47:06] <Lochlan> haha
[20:47:08] <danheberden> unless you're talking like hundreds of kilobytes of possible js
[20:47:20] <abjorn> sure aint :p
[20:47:56] <abjorn> I'll have a fair amount but not nearly that much. Honestly I've never done anything that really called for a script loader.
[20:48:28] <abjorn> Unless I needed to do a lot of polyfills, then yepnope would be pretty useful
[20:53:09] <desaiu> Help requested
[20:53:15] <abjorn> whatchya need
[20:54:41] <desaiu> http://desaiu.github.com
[20:54:57] <desaiu> I need a decent button solution that I can put anywhere
[20:55:24] <desaiu> If I take out the padding-top for the button, then it doesn't have this problem, but  need to move it around
[20:55:50] <desaiu> That is, I need to put it underneath "Do adwizlon makuns few chew at the loser was dickenson when chromium."
[20:56:30] <desaiu> Also, I don't know why the header and tbar don't extend 100% the length of the browser window
[20:56:49] <abjorn> body { margin: 0; }
[20:56:59] <abjorn> should try using a css reset
[20:58:45] <desaiu> abjorn: There is a reset
[20:59:08] <desaiu> That already exist
[20:59:10] <abjorn> *shrug* html { margin: 0; } idk
[20:59:19] <desaiu> That exist as well
[20:59:33] <desaiu> Did you look at the code? :P
[20:59:38] <abjorn> not a bit haha
[20:59:42] <desaiu> :)
[20:59:44] <buttersb> hey guys, im having an issue with this extend. it's not working how I thought.

[21:00:49] <kborchers> danheberden: ooh, that is much better than ?demo ... gotta remember that one
[21:01:12] <abjorn> then again, i work in tech support, im so used to saying everything all politely...:( what has happened to me?
[21:01:17] <desaiu> Oops, that's where i thought I was
[21:01:27] <abjorn> lol
[21:01:36] <abjorn> not quite
[21:01:39] <danheberden> we're not impolite.. just, um... terse
[21:01:40] <danheberden> lol
[21:01:46] <abjorn> at least it's in the same general domain i suppose haha
[21:01:54] <abjorn> lol thats a good way of putting it

[21:05:40] <danheberden> $.extend( {}, a, b );
[21:06:15] <buttersb> do you do a var thisvar = $.extend({},a,b);?
[21:06:37] <danheberden> page.State = $.extend( {}, page.default_params,History.getState().data);
[21:07:15] <buttersb> that's what im thinking. i thought i tried this already to no vail
[21:07:18] <buttersb> avail*
[21:07:49] <abjorn> Hm, IE 6 Update script doesn't seem to work in IE Tester :c
[21:08:06] <buttersb> hmm 		page.State = $.extend({},page.default_params,History.getState().data)
[21:08:06] <buttersb> 		console.log('state1:',page.State); is giving me just the default_params
[21:08:32] <danheberden> if you assign History.getState().data before that, do you get anything?
[21:08:34] <danheberden> like - drill down
[21:09:06] <danheberden> var data = History.getState().data; console.log( data); page.State = $.extend( {}, page.default_params, data );
[21:09:37] <buttersb> it wont even do it by itsself now
[21:09:53] <thegozt> jquery
[21:10:42] <danheberden> thegozt your powers of perception continue to serve you well
[21:10:54] <danheberden> buttersb twss
[21:11:04] <buttersb> twss?
[21:11:19] <buttersb> damn, History.getState() isnt pulling back what it should now
[21:11:43] <thegozt> danheberden......sweet!! that's pretty neat.
[21:11:53] <danheberden> MOAR DOTS
[21:13:43] <buttersb> damn, why wont it grab the parameter query=wtf
[21:20:52] <raiun> i'm trying to make a countdown script, but i'm new to jquery, can anybody point me to a tutorial or reference?  im not finding anything very instructive on google
[21:21:43] <buttersb> what sort of countdown
[21:21:51] <raiun> like an auction timer
[21:22:17] <raiun> i will be passing in an ending datetime from php then i want it to countdown seconds
[21:23:09] <Lochlan> http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html
[21:23:10] <Lochlan>  ?
[21:23:49] <raiun> id prefer to find a guide where i can learn to build it myself before i use 3rd party code, i want to make sure i understand it
[21:23:59] <Lochlan> ah
[21:26:19] <sparuvu> hey guys ......
[21:26:48] <sparuvu> how can I avoid the setTimeout function in making the ajax calls
[21:28:03] <wookiehangover> sparuvu: wat
[21:28:18] <wookiehangover> ? ajax
[21:28:19] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[21:28:27] <Cork> sparuvu: ajax is async by default (i think thats what you mean)
[21:28:34] <wookiehangover> ain't no setTimeout in tharr
[21:28:42] <Cork> sparuvu: if you disable async, the page will freez until it gets a responce
[21:29:02] <wookiehangover> its also the seed of some nasty bugs in IE
[21:30:18] <sparuvu> yeah but by the time I call the ajax function and push the response to the element ….the element is not rendering
[21:30:40] <sparuvu> so it not showing any data
[21:30:56] <buttersb> i will shoot this history plugin shortly
[21:52:03] <buttersb> anyone able to help with a $.extend
[21:52:34] <Cork> ?ask @ buttersb
[21:52:35] <bot-t> buttersb, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[21:58:03] <goldroger> hi, I am trying to iterate over a function's 'arguments' variable, which should contain all the arguments passed to the function. I use for(var i in arguments){...}; this works in the debugger console on chrome and firefox, but on on rhino command line client for linux

[21:58:28] <goldroger> but not on rhino command line client for linux*

[22:06:17] <Sora_> http://201.239.217.23/burbujas/
[22:08:16] <buttersb> why wont this override the damn object in my $.extend
[22:08:18] <Sora_> I tried to optimize each call and modified the dom but failed to resolve u.u
[22:08:41] <buttersb> http://pastie.org/2348758
[22:09:04] <buttersb> when it loads, its ALWAYS giving me the defaults in History.getState()
[22:09:06] <buttersb> im confused
[22:09:46] <Cork> Sora_: you mean the hover effect on the images?
[22:10:11] <Sora_> in the banner the fadeOut
[22:10:14] <Cork> oh, wait... :D
[22:10:23] * Cork disables abp ;P
[22:10:29] <Sora_> but onyl when u execute the hover in the boxes

[22:10:53] <Cork> na, forget it
[22:10:57] <buttersb> anyone able to help : http://pastie.org/2348758
[22:11:01] <Cork> wasn't what i though
[22:11:37] <Sora_> occurs only when running the fadeout and banner hover boxes
[22:11:45] <Sora_> and only in firesux
[22:11:49] <goldroger> hi Cork, basically rhino is it's own engine, written in java, like spidermonkey is written in C
[22:11:55] <goldroger> afaik
[22:12:10] <Cork> goldroger: might be they don't follow the specs then
[22:12:26] <goldroger> Cork: which one do you recommend
[22:12:31] <goldroger> for command line usage
[22:12:44] <skylamer`> сшя удинсх
[22:12:48] <skylamer`> Sora_, hello :)
[22:12:52] <Sora_> hi hi!
[22:12:55] <Sora_> ^^;
[22:12:59] <Cork> goldroger: well both webkit and spidermonkey exist for console use
[22:13:32] <Cork> goldroger: sorry spidermonkey and v8 ;P
[22:14:08] <Cork> goldrogerthey have the advantage of beeing well used so you know they are farly close to the specs
[22:14:27] <innociv> New lines is making me get a JSON read error from something.  I don't actually see the new lines in chrome network log or anything though. I don't see how escaping is failing.  Can anyone point me to what I should be looking at?
[22:14:58] <Cork> buttersb: when you extend nested objects you need to tell extend to do deep extention
[22:15:09] <Cork> buttersb: that is $(true, target, source)
[22:15:12] <Cork> gah...
[22:15:17] <Cork> buttersb: *that is $.extend(true, target, source)
[22:16:01] <Cork> innociv: do something like wget and dump it to a file
[22:16:48] <ignaciogiri> hello guys, is there a way to call local scroll without click action? right after document ready?
[22:17:04] <buttersb> i have to do deep in this case?
[22:17:11] <buttersb> does that mean beyond one level?
[22:17:17] <Cork> buttersb: yes
[22:17:40] <Cork> buttersb: { key: { key: val} }
[22:17:59] <Cork> if you want all to be uniq values after the extend you need to do a deep extension
[22:18:16] <Cork> else all objects in the resulting object will point to the same place
[22:18:48] <buttersb> so should i do a newobj = $.extend({},true,firstobj,secobj)?
[22:18:54] <Cork> no
[22:19:10] <Cork> ?jquery.extend @ buttersb
[22:19:10] <bot-t> buttersb, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[22:19:37] <buttersb> well then why the hell wont this grab and extend correctly
[22:20:03] <bricker> I'm writing in some basic emoticon support for messages… is there a better/faster way to render the messages with emoticons rather than just running replace() 12 times on each message?
[22:20:04] <buttersb> lol im frustrated sorry.
[22:20:22] <Cork> buttersb: add the value to do a deep extension, and see if that helps you
[22:20:54] <buttersb> add the value to a deep extend, then re-extend to my new parameter?
[22:20:54] <Cork> Sora_: not sure there is much you can do there actually
[22:21:13] <Cork> buttersb: just check the docs on the link up there
[22:21:31] <buttersb> i have checked those, multiple times.
[22:21:40] <buttersb> im still frustrated, because History.getState() wont work either.
[22:21:46] <Cork> and you've tested the deep extension option?
[22:22:14] <buttersb> im getting no difference
[22:24:10] <buttersb> especially frustrated because History.getState() wont grab the shit its' spose to
[22:24:12] <buttersb> grr
[22:24:32] <Cork> buttersb: wait a min...
[22:24:45] <Cork> does getState even exist?
[22:24:56] <buttersb> im almost positive
[22:25:50] <buttersb> var State = History.getState(); right out of the docs
[22:26:03] <Sora_> u.u
[22:26:08] <Sora_> fucking firefox
[22:26:36] <Cork> buttersb: firstly, js is case sensitive so it should be history, not History
[22:26:55] <Cork> buttersb: and secondly nether chromium or firefox gives me a getState command
[22:27:04] <Cork> only push and replace
[22:27:41] <buttersb> https://github.com/balupton/history.js
[22:28:25] <Cork> ah
[22:28:27] <Cork> its a wrapper
[22:28:54] <buttersb> yea, and it's spose to be good
[22:29:48] <Cork> buttersb: and you've tried page.State = $.extend(true, {},page.default_params,History.getState()); ?
[22:30:17] <buttersb> that's the one i did not try
[22:30:23] <Cork> uh...
[22:30:29] <Cork> then you haven't tried deep extension
[22:30:31] <Cork> -_-'
[22:30:33] <buttersb> lol
[22:30:40] <Cork> line 23 has the same problem
[22:30:53] <Cork> oh, wait no it doesn't
[22:31:12] <Cork> buttersb: a side note, ie will die on line 20
[22:31:34] <buttersb> why line 20?
[22:31:46] <Cork> dangling comma
[22:31:55] <buttersb> ah yes, the infamous ..
[22:32:00] <Cork> yup
[22:32:24] <Sora_> well then will reduce the time of fadeout
[22:32:29] <Sora_> ty Cork
[22:32:43] <Cork> Sora_: didn't really do much :/
[22:32:48] <Sora_> np np
[22:32:52] <Sora_> i try with canvas
[22:32:55] <Sora_> and the same problem
[22:32:58] <Sora_> u.u
[22:33:05] <buttersb> page.State = $.extend(true,{},page.default_params,History.getState().data); doesnt help
[22:33:30] <Cork> buttersb: dump to the console what you have in those objects
[22:33:48] <Cork> Sora_: it looks fine here
[22:33:53] <Cork> Sora_: what version of firefox?
[22:34:39] <buttersb> i went and used deparam, and that seemed to grab the url params right
[22:34:45] <buttersb> no clue why the History.getState() is failying.
[22:34:49] <buttersb> it's killing me
[22:35:44] <Sora_> Cork : 5.0.1 in lion
[22:36:09] <Iarfen> hi
[22:36:44] <Cork> Sora_: hmm, pre 6/7 have some speed problems
[22:36:45] <Iarfen> How I can disable a element with jQuery?? (Make that it doesn't have effect and give them a color more transparent
[22:37:35] <Cork> Sora_: not really a solution but might be worth looking at there beta(6) or alpha(7) release, might be something that will go away over time
[22:37:36] <Sora_> Cork sry my english sux i dont understand :S
[22:37:53] <Sora_> ohh ok ok
[22:38:01] <Cork> Sora_: ff6 is bound to be released in 8 days
[22:38:09] <graphikz> http://69.115.234.246:3000/listings -- on the maps tab, the controls are really glitchy. any ideas? - wasn't sure if this was the best place to ask or not (maybe jq is interfering?)
[22:38:16] <Cork> Sora_: ff7 in another 6 weeks
[22:38:22] <Lochlan> Iarfen: can it just be removed from the DOM? .remove()
[22:38:29] <buttersb> anything good in ff6
[22:38:44] <Cork> Sora_: especially ff7 has some really good memory improvments
[22:38:54] <Sora_> ok ok i dont not understood what you meant to pre 6 / 7
[22:39:00] <Sora_> oka
[22:39:12] <Cork> buttersb: pre as in ff5 or ff4
[22:39:19] <Sora_> I can only expect u.u
[22:39:23] <Cork> ops
[22:39:27] <Cork> Sora_: ^
[22:39:27] <Sora_> lol
[22:39:29] <Sora_> np
[22:39:31] <Iarfen> Lochlan: No, what i want to do is that in the time between the execution of an ajax process the user can't click a link or execute another ajax or everything in the web page
[22:39:34] <Lochlan> what's up with the controls, graphikz?
[22:39:46] <Lochlan> ah
[22:40:11] <Lochlan> Iarfen: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2008/12/how-to-disableenable-element-with.html ?
[22:40:13] <Iarfen> Lochlan: And I too want to do that all the elements become a little obscure during this processs
[22:40:21] <Iarfen> Lochlan: ok ty!!
[22:40:26] <graphikz> Lochlan: http://i.imm.io/7R1e.png
[22:40:28] <graphikz> on the left
[22:40:54] <Lochlan> and also u can do .opacity(0.5) to dim the elements
[22:40:55] <buttersb> i think i got it working, but no thanks to history.getstate
[22:40:57] <buttersb> effing thing
[22:41:04] <raiun> Hi, new to jquery/javascript... http://pastie.org/2348857  i'm getting "Too much recursion" error, why is that?
[22:41:23] <Lochlan> ah yeah
[22:41:26] <Lochlan> that little white bit?
[22:41:34] <Lochlan> is it meant to be the map controls?
[22:41:40] <graphikz> yup
[22:41:42] <graphikz> default controls
[22:42:04] <Spinkzeit> Is it possible to do something like $.animate({height: 'auto'}); etc?
[22:42:30] <graphikz> Spinkzeit: it'll go to default heigh
[22:42:31] <Lochlan> i dont think you can do auto Spinkzeit
[22:42:31] <graphikz> t
[22:42:43] <graphikz> or should
[22:42:52] <Spinkzeit> It doesn't :(
[22:42:53] <Lochlan> not sure why that's happening graphikz
[22:43:05] <graphikz> a lot of the controls are loading up as display: none;
[22:43:24] <Lochlan> yeah
[22:43:30] <Iarfen> Lochlan: the solution you give me doesn't work for jquery function, only for forms....
[22:43:44] <Lochlan> ah
[22:43:45] <Lochlan> well
[22:43:52] <Lochlan> whatever triggers the function
[22:43:57] <Lochlan> like clicking an element
[22:44:01] <Lochlan> you disable that element
[22:44:06] <Lochlan> then the function won't run ?
[22:44:07] <Spinkzeit> Lochlan: do you know any other methods how to get an elements height to animate it or somethingsomething?
[22:44:15] <Sora_> raiun: u need use setinterval
[22:44:25] <graphikz> Spinkzeit: what're you trying to do?
[22:44:28] <Sora_> and clear when this finish
[22:44:36] <Lochlan> Spinkzeit, not off the top of my head, no
[22:44:56] <Iarfen> Lochlan: yes, I want that
[22:45:09] <Spinkzeit> graphikz: basically I have an element with height:180px, and I want it when hovered over it animates to full size
[22:45:14] <raiun> Sora_: what do you mean clear when this finish
[22:45:19] <Spinkzeit> like slideToggle()
[22:45:22] <Cork> buttersb: sorry for the delay, i had to dig a bit to find the link https://wiki.mozilla.org/Features/Release_Tracking#Firefox_6:_Desktop
[22:45:53] <graphikz> Spinkzeit: have you tried slideDown?
[22:46:08] <Spinkzeit> graphikz: I have not...
[22:46:11] <Spinkzeit> interesting.
[22:46:15] <buttersb> yea i am downloading ff aurora
[22:46:17] <Cork> buttersb: but ff6 and ff7 is much about memory improvments (but there is more)
[22:46:19] <graphikz> http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[22:46:23] <buttersb> just to check it out
[22:46:42] <Spinkzeit> graphikz: Doesn't work, I assume it's using the css height it's set to
[22:46:59] <Lochlan> ok, now I have a question
[22:47:14] <Lochlan> I'm pulling in a bunch of data with an ajax request
[22:47:23] <Lochlan> and binding it to a template
[22:47:29] <Lochlan> but there's say 200 entrie
[22:47:30] <Lochlan> s
[22:47:41] <Lochlan> how do i pull in the first 50, then load the next 50 as they scroll?
[22:47:43] <Spinkzeit> graphikz: don't worry I worked out I can do $.css('height', 'auto) then get the height in px from that :)
[22:47:45] <Spinkzeit> Cheers
[22:48:03] <graphikz> ohh ok
[22:48:04] <graphikz> smart
[22:49:09] <Spinkzeit> although i don't know the flow process of it cause it needs to know the height in px before it animates, but eh
[22:50:34] <graphikz> Lochlan: like http://contextllc.com/dev_tools/jQuery/scrollExtend/latest/jquery.scrollExtend.example.html ?
[22:51:33] <Lochlan> yes, pretty much
[22:51:48] <graphikz> http://contextllc.com/node/51
[22:51:52] <graphikz> that's the plugin
[22:51:59] <Lochlan> im not sure what to do with the ajax call.. to get the last X amount of entries
[22:52:24] <Sora_> Cork: ty for u help
[22:52:31] <Sora_> bye bye
[22:52:34] <Cork> Sora_: np
[22:52:54] <graphikz> keep track with a global variable
[22:53:00] <graphikz> then get the from x to x+50
[22:53:15] <Lochlan> hmm
[22:53:18] <Lochlan> each message has an ID
[22:53:34] <Kopion> hmmm
[22:53:50] <Lochlan> so i could say grab 50, record the 50th ID as a var
[22:54:03] <Lochlan> then make it grab the next 50 starting at the 50th ID
[22:56:36] <Lochlan> probably be how to do it
[22:56:46] <Lochlan> ill wait for my back end guy to get back
[23:01:42] <phoe6>  function foo(){  /* code */ }();  // SyntaxError: Unexpected token )
[23:01:52] <phoe6> Why is it a SyntaxError at ) instead of (
[23:02:55] <Lochlan> what's the () at the end for?
[23:03:41] <phoe6> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[23:04:01] <phoe6> reading this tutorial and I suspect either there is somethign wrong there or I am misunderstanding.
[23:08:45] <snover>  ain’t nothin wrong with that article.
[23:09:49] <phoe6> snover: I got it. function foo(){  /* code */ }();  will be like function foo(){  /* code */ }; ();  and (); is a SyntaxError at )
[23:13:19] <domo> hey guys.. can't seem to figure this out.. how can I select an element by the value? <h1>this text</h1> I want to select by "this text"
[23:13:23] <danheberden> ?eval (function() { return "nou";
[23:13:25] <danheberden> oops
[23:13:28] <danheberden> silly, return key
[23:13:44] <danheberden> (function() { /* shit here */ } )();
[23:13:47] <danheberden> phoe6 ^
[23:14:08] <danheberden> domo why on earth would you want to do that?
[23:14:19] <danheberden> 'tis gonna be expensive of a selector
[23:14:26] <domo> yeah I know
[23:14:30] <domo> maybe I can select it another way
[23:14:35] <domo> it's not my page
[23:14:50] <danheberden> so, like, h1:contains('this text')
[23:15:07] <danheberden> ?contains
[23:15:09] <phoe6> danheberden: understood that. thanks.
[23:15:14] <danheberden> oh, right, no bot-t
[23:15:50] <danheberden> phoe6 k- you didn't have the () around the fn{}, so was making sure :)
[23:16:37] <buttersb> hmm, in the html response of an ajax call, how do i append just one specific div
[23:16:52] <buttersb> this code i have in another page works, but wont work in this instance. little confused.
[23:17:21] <danheberden> i'll assume that you know returning html isn't typically a good idea
[23:17:28] <danheberden> but first, construct a node based off of it
[23:17:33] <buttersb> success: function(response){$('#container').append($('#divfromresponsetoload'))}
[23:17:44] <danheberden> var $result - $( theShitFromTheServer );
[23:18:06] <danheberden> $( '#container' ).append( $result.find( '#thatOneDiv') );
[23:18:18] <danheberden> ya dig?
[23:18:39] <buttersb> thats what i did homeskillet lol
[23:19:04] <danheberden> so start logging that shiz - make sure it's what you're after
