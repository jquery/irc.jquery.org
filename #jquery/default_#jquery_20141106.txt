[00:23:00] <sammych1> trying to find the official word on if -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch works on 4.x Android WebView
[00:27:49] <fat> Cork: Am I going in the right direction: http://jsbin.com/diroboluqi/2/edit?html,js,output
[00:28:32] <Cork> sammych1: your trying to get official info about and android feature in jquery??
[00:28:36] <Cork> sammych1: good luck :)
[00:29:16] <Cork> you might be lucky and an android executive might just happen to stumble by
[00:30:14] <Cork> fat: please don't use jsbin
[00:30:24] <Cork> at least if you want to to do anything with it
[00:30:40] <Cork> i've lost too many responses to there stupid auto save feature
[00:30:58] <Cork> *want me to do
[00:31:07] <fat> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/ns21Lc5n/ here is a fiddle instead
[00:32:14] <Cork> fat: close http://jsfiddle.net/ns21Lc5n/1/
[00:33:12] <Cork> actually some more cleanup http://jsfiddle.net/ns21Lc5n/2/
[00:33:12] <fat> it needs to toggle the content. what function should i use instead Cork ?
[00:33:22] <Cork> you can't toggle it
[00:33:38] <Cork> set a class on the new row and remove the tr if it has the class
[00:34:02] <Cork> fat: you could add the content statically in the html
[00:34:10] <Cork> and toggle a class to do it
[00:34:14] <fat> ok
[00:34:33] <fat> because each content, for each row, will have different content   .after('<tr><td colspan="3">hi</td></tr>');
[00:36:21] <Expel> Why does my FancyBox reload the page when clicking on images?
[00:36:22] <Cork> fat: http://jsfiddle.net/ns21Lc5n/3/
[00:36:30] <Cork> fat: also don't abuse <a> tags
[00:36:38] <Cork> use a <button> for action
[00:36:46] <Cork> you can style it like a link if you like
[00:39:29] <fat> Cork: thanks so much!
[00:44:09] <fat> Cork: instead of <a> to trigger the event, I use <tr> on click. Do you think this is a good way to do it? http://jsfiddle.net/ns21Lc5n/9/
[00:44:40] <Uhkis> fat: do you always press update after each change in jsfiddle?
[00:44:54] <fat> i press run first
[00:45:04] <fat> sometimes i press update
[00:45:28] <Cork> fat: an option http://jsfiddle.net/ns21Lc5n/10/
[00:45:30] <Uhkis> i was just wondering your >5k revision yesterday :-)
[00:46:02] <Cork> though the .closest isn't needed if you do that
[00:46:11] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ns21Lc5n/11/
[00:46:25] <Cork> fat: about "a good way" is all up to you
[00:46:33] <Cork> it depends on how you want the interface to work
[00:46:40] <fat> ok
[00:46:49] <fat> thank you for your help cork
[00:46:54] <Cork> np
[00:47:20] <Expel> Does anyone know why FancyBox is reloading the whole page when I click on my gallery images?
[01:22:30] <fat> Cork: is there an efficient method where, if one of the <tr> is already visible and user clicks another <tr> (to show more content), the first one would be hidden?
[01:27:02] <Cork> fat: $(this).closest('tbody').find('.info').removeClass('show')
[01:27:10] <Cork> not super efficient, but there best you can do
[01:27:24] <Cork> *the best
[01:28:09] <quuxman> is there a way to make the browser page loading indicator trigger when making a $.ajax call?
[01:28:18] <fat> Cork: but then, if you click the same <tr> again, it doesn't toggle
[01:28:30] <fat> http://jsfiddle.net/ns21Lc5n/12/
[01:28:40] <Cork> quuxman: show it before you start the ajax call and hide it in always/complete
[01:28:54] <quuxman> I'm assuming no, otherwise there wouldn't be so many custom loading animations everywhere
[01:29:37] <quuxman> Cork: I mean the built-in browser indicator, that's shown, for example in chrome, in place of the page icon in the tab
[01:29:58] <Cork> fat: http://jsfiddle.net/ns21Lc5n/13/
[01:30:07] <Cork> quuxman: no you can't
[01:30:24] <Cork> that one is controled by the browser
[01:32:07] <HamburgerBurglar> Does anyone know how to trigger a function when a slideToggle(); is halfway done ?
[01:34:30] <Cork> HamburgerBurglar: you could try hooking into the step callback
[01:36:36] <HamburgerBurglar> I'll probably go that way. It's just I've been looking at the progress function it has but it confuses the ever living noodles out of me.
[01:37:30] <_lazarevsky> hey guys
[01:37:31] <_lazarevsky> I wanna say
[01:37:44] <_lazarevsky> find me all the anchor elements which have a class of "target-class"
[01:37:48] <fat> that doesn't work either Cork: if you click on one of the <tr>'s twice, it should  hide the info
[01:37:48] <_lazarevsky> how can I do that in jQuery?
[01:38:03] <_lazarevsky> I tried this -> $('a[class='active']').removeClass('active')
[01:38:12] <_lazarevsky> but I'm getting Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[01:38:13] <_lazarevsky> thanks so much
[01:38:14] <Cork> _lazarevsky: $('a.target-class')
[01:38:20] <HamburgerBurglar> ^
[01:38:28] <_lazarevsky> Cork: thanks a million
[01:38:48] <HamburgerBurglar> $('a.target-class').removeClass('active'); would be the full line.
[01:41:38] <Uhkis> _lazarevsky: your error was from using ' in stuff wrapped with '
[01:41:53] <Cork> well and using attribute selectors for classes
[01:43:47] <Uhkis> Cork: that should work tho?
[01:44:08] <Cork> it is valid but it will most likely not give the result you want
[01:44:26] <Cork> as it won't match <elm class="target-class other classes">
[01:45:29] <Uhkis> well that's another type of error
[01:51:56] <HamburgerBurglar> Hey cork sorry for being dense here but .slideToggle('slow', step:function(){}) how exactly do I make step trigger at 50% of the animation ?
[02:04:18] <Cork> HamburgerBurglar: you don't
[02:04:38] <Cork> you have to check what step it is at and when you hit the half mark do what you want
[02:05:20] <HamburgerBurglar> What kind of value does step return ? A 1 to 0.5 or percentage value ? Or a flat value on a scale of a 100 ?
[02:06:09] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/#slideToggle-options
[02:06:43] <Cork> hmm
[02:06:50] <Cork> haven't seen the progress before
[02:06:57] <Cork> that might actually fit better for what you need
[02:07:14] <HamburgerBurglar> I've been looking into that earlier but I can't seem to grasp how to utilize it
[02:07:45] <Cork> check the progress argument for what value it is at
[02:07:55] <Cork> or the remaining ms
[02:08:12] <Cork> the later is prob what you want
[02:08:25] <Cork> note that you need to store a value for if you have triggered
[02:08:40] <Cork> cause you can't check reminingMs == (time / 2)
[02:08:50] <Cork> cause if something lags that target might be missed
[02:09:17] <Cork> so you need to check if(!triggered && remainingMs < (time / 2)
[02:09:30] <HamburgerBurglar> Give me a couple of minutes. I'm going to set up a fiddle real quick
[02:25:49] <HamburgerBurglar> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/J___/joezb1en/
[02:40:01] <HamburgerBurglar> Hey Cork http://jsfiddle.net/J___/joezb1en/1/ I got something working but the animation triggers when it's done, not when it's halfway :/
[02:47:15] <mobelirer> hi, what is the best way to know if i am on a mobile device?
[02:48:33] <HamburgerBurglar> var mobile = {
[02:48:33] <HamburgerBurglar>     is_mobile: false,
[02:48:33] <HamburgerBurglar>     init: function () {
[02:48:33] <HamburgerBurglar>         this.is_mobile = (/Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent))?true:false;
[02:48:33] <HamburgerBurglar>     }
[02:48:34] <HamburgerBurglar> };
[02:48:42] <HamburgerBurglar> Is what I usually use
[02:48:52] <decx> http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/
[02:48:53] <Uhkis> please never paste code to irc again
[02:49:02] <HamburgerBurglar> Yeah. My b
[02:49:21] <HamburgerBurglar> I'll pm it next time
[02:53:54] <mobelirer> thank you
[03:02:55] <Xtrivity> Hi guys, I am stumbled on an issue. I want the box containing the header to transition slow and smoothly, can't seem to figure out how to make this work: http://jsfiddle.net/1k2q50uv/3/
[03:12:18] <slax0r> Xtrivity: you mean that the container would be "animated" and not just snap to the new width?
[03:14:15] <Xtrivity> slax0r, yeah
[03:15:02] <slax0r> not exactly an expert on those
[03:15:18] <slax0r> but I think you will have to simultainusly animate the width and the fadeIn
[03:15:26] <slax0r> or animate the width and then do fadein
[03:16:25] <Xtrivity> slax0r,  i've spent over 2 hrs trying to figure out a way to do it. can't seem to come up with a correct answer.
[03:21:39] <Cork> HamburgerBurglar: you put the second animation in the same animation queue
[03:22:05] <Cork> you need to give it a new queue so it runs simultanious
[03:23:01] <Cork> hmm
[03:23:06] <Cork> and you have to use .animate
[03:23:18] <Cork> fadeTo doesn't expose the queue
[03:24:09] <HamburgerBurglar> Using animate would force me to say either slideUp or down. And since my code needs to decide wether to slideUp or down based on positioning and top or bottom values that isn't an option
[03:24:34] <Cork> HamburgerBurglar: no not for fadeTo
[03:24:41] <Cork> just animate opacity
[03:27:39] <icio> My ajax response invoked through $.getJSON is 403'ing and none of the done/fail/always callbacks appear to be called. Any advice?
[03:28:10] <Cork> icio: jsonp?
[03:28:24] <icio> Cork: yeah, it is
[03:28:31] <icio> Ah, hm.
[03:28:40] <Cork> scripts don't expose failed cross browsers
[03:28:47] <Cork> so error handling isn't supported
[03:29:05] <icio> Yeah, makes sense now that you've pointed it out.
[03:34:41] <icio> Cork: I can confirm an error event is triggered on the <script> element that's added, though
[03:34:56] <Cork> icio: yes but not cross browsers
[03:35:16] <Cork> so to get a consistent api it isn't exposed in jquery
[03:35:30] <Cork> icio: you can switch to jquery-2.x and the error will be exposed
[03:35:38] <Cork> but you lose compatibility with pre ie8
[03:35:40] <Cork> sorry
[03:35:41] <Cork> pre ie9
[03:35:50] <icio> Not too worried about that -- it's for some internal tooling
[03:35:59] <Cork> use 2.1 then
[03:35:59] <icio> So thanks, I'll look into jquery 2.x
[03:45:17] <hxm> hi i am using datepicker() and i want to make the calendar visible in a div all the time when the page is loaded, how can i do that?
[03:47:35] <Cork> hxm: http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#inline
[03:48:32] <hxm> yes i did that, i have the same example (almost) and i get an error in console, then i type manually $("#date").datepicker(); and it works but only when i click on the input text
[03:48:49] <hxm> ah, is because is a input text not a div?
[03:48:51] <hxm> i go try
[03:48:53] <Cork> :)
[03:49:01] <Cork> yes that is what the point of the link was
[03:58:17] <elmargol> http://caniuse.com/ is there something like this for javascript?
[03:59:21] <Cork> mdn is quite good
[03:59:33] <elmargol> like .val
[03:59:45] <Cork> .val isn't javascript
[03:59:54] <Cork> it is a compatibility implemented in jquery
[04:00:10] <Cork> so it is browser independent
[04:00:17] <elmargol> ah ok
[04:00:20] <elmargol> great :)
[04:01:12] <carlton> umm
[04:01:35] <carlton> im having a weird problem where setting: "someObj = {}" doesn't actually empty the object
[04:01:55] <carlton> i do a console log before and after
[04:02:00] <carlton> and the BEFORE is empty
[04:02:11] <carlton> while the AFTER has the original properties in it
[04:05:55] <suexec> var my_iface = $("#img_container").attr("name");     alert(my_iface);    $("#img_container").attr("src","GetGraph.php?interface=bw."+my_iface+"&height=250&width=800&start="+start+"&end="+end+"&random="+Math.random()); <- This will alert the value of attribute "name", but the src attr gets "undefined" for my_iface. Why ?
[04:06:16] <suexec> btw, nanobe spamming people when they type in chan ;)
[04:27:01] <Plastefuchs> first real time fiddling with js and jquery (in django no less) and i try to submit a form a certain way, as if i would press the 'Save and continue editing' button http://jsfiddle.net/oashbwqq/ Is that selector-thing there even close to what i want?
[04:28:10] <giorgiodinapoli> $(event.currentTarget.parentElement.parentElement + ' td[data-field="from_text"]') <--- how can i make something like this
[04:29:46] <Uhkis> Plastefuchs:
[04:29:49] <Uhkis> oops
[04:29:57] <Uhkis> Plastefuchs: $('input[name="_continue"]')
[04:32:21] <Plastefuchs> huh
[04:34:38] <Cork> giorgiodinapoli: $(this).closest('selector matching the parent').find('td[data-field...]')
[04:35:16] <Cork> Plastefuchs: you should use a form around that
[04:35:46] <Cork> and use the forms submit event instead
[04:35:46] <giorgiodinapoli> Cork, thx man
[04:36:07] <Cork> giorgiodinapoli: .closest searches backwards up the parent tree
[04:36:17] <Cork> so use a selector matching from that direction
[04:36:33] <Cork> giorgiodinapoli: like ex. $(this).closest('div').find('td[data-field...]')
[04:36:45] <Plastefuchs> Cork: there is a form around it, i just didn't want to paste the whole thing
[04:37:24] <Cork> ok then ya
[04:37:34] <Cork> remove the space like Uhkis showed
[04:37:59] <Uhkis> and s/submit/input/
[04:38:12] <Cork> :submit is fine
[04:38:39] <Cork> not really needed
[04:38:44] <suexec> Anybody got anything on my question ?
[04:38:45] <Cork> but it is ok :)
[04:39:00] <Cork> suexec: you prob want to ask the question again
[04:39:06] <carlton> how do i add :selected to an option, not as an attribute or property
[04:39:10] <Cork> when the question has scrolled off screen you rarely get an answer
[04:39:11] <Uhkis> suexec: fiddle would help
[04:39:11] <suexec> var my_iface = $("#img_container").attr("name");     alert(my_iface);    $("#img_container").attr("src","GetGraph.php?interface=bw."+my_iface+"&height=250&width=800&start="+start+"&end="+end+"&random="+Math.random()); <- This will alert the value of attribute "name", but the src attr gets "undefined" for my_iface. Why ?
[04:39:33] <Cork> carlton: that question makes no sense
[04:39:35] <Uhkis> nanobe pm spam confirmed
[04:39:43] <Cork> suexec: ya, fiddle it
[04:39:46] <Cork> ?paste
[04:39:46] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:40:01] <carlton> Cork, my multiple selects don't actually apply a selected attribute to my selected options... I don't really understand it
[04:40:38] <Cork> carlton: are you using a <select> replacement plugin?
[04:40:52] <Cork> or a native <select>
[04:41:14] <carlton> i'm not sure because im doing this in Django admin with django-suit
[04:41:27] <carlton> it's possible that the select has been overridden
[04:41:39] <Cork> does the element look like a normal form list?
[04:41:54] <carlton> yeah
[04:42:06] <carlton> scrollbar, list of options
[04:42:19] <Cork> then you should be able to select the option element and set prop('selected', true') on it
[04:43:42] <carlton> when i select something, the select's change event triggers, and i look at the val() and it's correct, then i find selected options with $('option:selected'), works fine, but if i look in the actual HTML, none of the options actually have a selected="selected" attribute
[04:44:02] <carlton> so i can't select anything with jquery
[04:44:21] <carlton> because it seems like a different KIND of select O_O
[04:45:18] <Plastefuchs> nanobe: what are you messaging me with? :V
[04:46:26] <Cork> carlton: http://jsfiddle.net/10v5ko1k/
[04:46:50] <Cork> carlton: if it doesn't look like that, you aren't using a native select element
[04:46:57] <Cork> and then your kinda on your own
[04:47:12] <Cork> you need to figure out what plugin your using to emulate select elements
[04:47:22] <carlton> alright ty
[04:47:24] <Cork> and try to figure out if it has apis to do what you want
[04:48:23] <suexec> Cork, Uhkis , it didn't work what so ever on fiddle .. http://jsfiddle.net/q3todw1y/ ..
[04:48:30] <suexec> probably because of some regex stuff etc.
[04:51:54] <Cork> suexec: the #start_time element is missing
[04:51:59] <Cork> so nothing happens
[04:52:08] <Cork> ah sorry missed it
[04:53:06] <suexec> Cork, the problem is that in my keyup function, I do alert($("#img_container").attr("name"));  and it has a value .. but when setting the src attribute, it valuates to undefined
[04:53:52] <Cork> suexec: you shouldn't be abusing name for this
[04:54:00] <Cork> use data- or .data instead
[04:55:23] <suexec> I made the fiddle work .. so maybe it's the name attribute it's not liking ?
[04:55:54] <suexec> working fiddle, http://jsfiddle.net/q3todw1y/4/
[04:56:31] <suexec> not working on my setup though.. grr
[04:56:33] <Cork> suexec: name is an attribute that has a special meaning
[04:56:44] <Cork> so ya, that will cause problems
[04:56:56] <Cork> suexec: and don't use data
[04:57:06] <Cork> use data- as a prefix for your name
[04:57:24] <Cork> liek data-name="" or data-interface="" or something
[05:01:33] <suexec> changed it to data-iface. Looking at the img, it has the correct attribute, but the .attr() is still fetching undefined for some bloody reason
[05:03:30] <suexec> and alerting the value before using it, returns the correct result
[05:05:54] <Cork> suexec: is this what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/q3todw1y/5/
[05:06:53] <suexec> Cork, yep, that's what I want. Let me show you what happens on my end:
[05:07:48] <Cork> suexec: you sat the final url to data instead of src in the fiddle
[05:07:56] <Cork> so that was possibly what went wrong
[05:09:11] <suexec> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/q3todw1y/6/ . Alerting target shows item_00.00, and the url gets set to GetGraph.php?interface=bw.undefined&height=250&width=800&start=2014/11/06%2012:30:33&end=2014/11/06%2013:30:33&random=0.9841661052778363 <- Note the bw.undefined.
[05:11:29] <suexec> Cork, actually, using my fiddle above, try editing one of the text fields.
[05:11:50] <suexec> the start_time one to be exact-
[05:12:40] <suexec> nvm. works when I click it as normal. I wonder if the .plainmodal resets the state or something ??
[05:12:49] <suexec> or, can't be that either as the alert has the data
[05:13:25] <Cork> or it might serialize the elements
[05:13:31] <Cork> and kill all the event handlers
[05:14:55] <suexec> How can the alert keep popping the correct data though ?
[05:16:11] <Cork> never ever use alert for debuging
[05:16:16] <Cork> *debugging
[05:16:24] <Cork> you can't depend on it not breaking events
[05:16:29] <Plastefuchs> console.log() all the things!
[05:17:01] <Cork> or rather it is known to break event execution order
[05:17:10] <Cork> trigger events to fire twice
[05:17:15] <Cork> and a lot of other nasty things
[05:18:25] <suexec> console.log contains same data.
[05:18:49] <suexec> I even tried setting the entire url in a var, writing it to console (and it's correct!), then applying that to the src .. still no go.
[05:18:52] <Cork> suexec: could for example be you have two elements with the same id
[05:19:18] <suexec> for sure only one #img_container
[05:19:31] <Cork> suexec: console.log($('[id="img_container"]').length)
[05:19:47] <Cork> run that in the event handler
[05:20:18] <suexec> Cork, 1
[05:20:26] <Cork> hmm
[05:20:35] <Cork> what browser?
[05:20:59] <suexec> Cork, console.log(url); gives GetGraph.php?interface=bw.GigabitEthernet0_0.455&height=250&width=800&start=2014/11/06 13:20:05&end=2014/11/06 14:20:05&random=0.2058238957542926 . Setting "url" to the src, still has undefined.
[05:21:02] <suexec> google chrome
[05:21:11] <Cork> ah
[05:21:22] <Cork> you might have to replce the entire img element
[05:21:33] <Cork> chrome is a bit anal about changing src on img elements
[05:21:59] <fat> Cork: when I sort my table, the additional content should also move underneat the <tr> too instead of staying where it is. How can I fix this? http://jsfiddle.net/gFzCk/2551/
[05:22:01] <suexec> that's why I put the random in there. Was hoping that would cause a reload. I support I can replace the whole thing though.
[05:22:11] <suexec> suppose *
[05:22:16] <hactor> Cork, do you still not like TypeScript
[05:23:14] <Cork> fat: you would have to take that into consideration when your doing the sorting
[05:23:53] <Cork> fat: so it might be simpler to create them in js and remove them on sort
[05:24:14] <fat> instead of that, can i just make it hide the additional content when i click the header?
[05:24:22] <fat> do you think that's better?
[05:24:23] <Cork> suexec: img doesn't fire onload events if the img has already tried loading an image and so on
[05:24:35] <hactor> Aww :( Cork ignores me
[05:24:56] <Cork> suexec: might be better to create the img tag when you have a valid url
[05:25:06] <Cork> instead of having a broken image until you do
[05:25:18] <suexec> Cork, guess I'll dick about with it a bit more. Makes absolutely no sense why what is logged to the console would be any different when putting in an url though. :P
[05:25:20] <Cork> hactor: yes i tend to ignore trolls
[05:25:30] <hactor> Cork, I'm not a troll :(
[05:25:34] <suexec> hm, it's not because of _ or ., is it ?
[05:26:17] <Cork> in the url you mean?
[05:26:26] <Cork> no the browser don't care
[05:26:28] <suexec> yeah. wasn't that either.
[05:26:53] <suexec> Makes no sense how a logged variable changes without any manipulation inbetween though
[05:27:00] <Cork> suexec: btw did you say the fiddle example works for you?
[05:27:12] <suexec> Cork, yep, the fiddle works.
[05:27:15] <Cork> suexec: changes?
[05:27:18] <Cork> what changes?
[05:27:55] <suexec> Cork, console.log(url); $("#img_container").attr("src",url); <- Those two lines are directly in that order. console.log has correct content in "url". the src has "undefined" for a tiny part of it when set.
[05:28:27] <Cork> suexec: does prop instead of attr make a difference?
[05:28:47] <Cork> suexec: your assuming the variable change content
[05:28:59] <Cork> but you inspect two different things
[05:29:12] <suexec> Cork, prop had same effect.
[05:29:45] <Cork> and you are absolutely sure $('#img_container') targets the correct <img> element?
[05:30:04] <suexec> Yep. I only have a single <img element on the page.
[05:30:16] <Cork> that isn't the same thing
[05:30:32] <Cork> make sure it actually target the correct element
[05:30:38] <suexec> I am absolutely sure. When console.log my test, it has the correct data.
[05:31:46] <Cork> suexec: when you debug a problem
[05:32:00] <Cork> don't base the debugging on assumsion
[05:32:12] <Cork> just cause you find something you sat on something that should be something
[05:32:15] <Cork> doesn't mean it is
[05:32:27] <Cork> log the element in the event
[05:32:35] <Cork> and make sure it actually IS the element you want
[05:33:09] <Cork> this is especially true when you use third party plugins that might do things you don't know it does
[05:34:57] <suexec> I think you are right. I believe it's the modal doing something fishy.
[05:44:07] <Vivekananda> hey everyone. is jParkton around ?
[05:53:01] <factor> What are the best JQury Ajax libs?
[05:53:22] <factor> JQuery even^
[05:55:48] <suexec> Cork, I am using this now, http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal/ . Does that actually make a "copy" of the modal div ?
[06:19:11] <P0rk> tharkun, are you talking about the icon?
[06:19:29] <P0rk> wow. nvm
[06:20:25] <P0rk> does the .serialize method return php-compatible json if object notation is used in form field names?
[06:21:27] <P0rk> in other words if I have input name='contact[name]' and input name='contact[address]' will jquery's serialize method return a contact object with a name and an address propterty (in JSON format)?
[06:26:09] <fictive> Anyone have any experience with http://daniel-zahariev.github.io/jquery-textntags/ ?
[06:26:34] <fictive> When making a tag with @dan in any of the example text boxes, try selecting an item with a touch pad on a laptop
[06:26:48] <fictive> you have to click REALLY fast for it to be selected, while clicking with a regular mouse works just fine
[06:27:06] <fictive> what could be the cause of this? I can't find anywhere in the library that would imply that a timer has been set in motion to detect long presses
[06:28:45] <P0rk> fictive, haven't looked at that site, but is it possible that your trackpad is not sending the click and hold correctly. I know that I disabled the drag feature on my trackpad a while back because I kept dragging things I didn't mean to.
[06:33:03] <seismo> hi there
[06:34:19] <P0rk> Hellow
[06:35:53] <seismo> how can i measure the length of a text as if it would not break? i have a short text in a div that might be too small to display the text in one line. so it will probably break into multiple. now i wanna know how wide the text would have been if it had all the space it needs.
[06:35:55] <fictive> P0rk: I have verified with three separate trackpads
[06:36:16] <P0rk> fictive, I can't get any of the examples on that site to work none of them let me select from the auto-suggest window
[06:36:38] <fictive> P0rk: have you tried slamming the trackpad button really fast?
[06:37:03] <seismo> can i somehow render the text outside of the document and then measure its width or so?
[06:37:12] <P0rk> fictive, tried it with my mouse on my desktop. It registers the click but doesn't modify the input
[06:37:37] <fictive> P0rk: regular users will probably just press enter or tab, but for less "skilled" people (read: my mother), the track pad might be an option
[06:37:48] <P0rk> seismo, you can append it to the dom inside of an element positioned off the screen and measure it there.
[06:40:54] <hactor> suexec, why are you using  simplemodal, this thing is god damn ugly
[06:42:45] <seismo> P0rk: position: fixed; left: -9999999; ?
[06:42:59] <suexec> hactor, functionality first - eyecandy later.
[06:45:02] <P0rk> seismo, did you try it. Try Jsfiddle with a test example.
[06:46:31] <seismo> will try :) was that what you meant?
[06:50:19] <decx> if you push something offscreen with position make sure to overflow: hidden
[06:50:55] <decx> then again it could be that it doesnt affect perf with a negative left
[06:51:17] <P0rk> does textarea fire the focus event?
[06:51:52] <P0rk> duh, nvm
[07:04:57] <P0rk> How do you change fontSize?
[07:05:05] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/c2et59f1/12/
[07:07:56] <rosieres> how should I cast for :after? $(this).find(':after') while $(this) is an <li>
[07:09:44] <Ice_Strike2> I need suggestion what to do. I have a dropdown which contain a number from 1 to 5 select. Let say I say select 3 which will then show 3 input text boxes.. If I change a dropdown to 2 and then go back select 3
[07:09:55] <Ice_Strike2> How to remember the value what it was on all text boxes?
[07:10:46] <RTPMatt> Put them in an array?
[07:11:37] <Ice_Strike2> Hmmmm
[07:11:41] <P0rk> create a function that listens to the change method on the select box and generates the inputs accordingly
[07:13:01] <Ice_Strike2> P0rk Yes I know how to do that, my point is remembering the value was entered in all input text boxes. Let say select dropdown value 5.. and I change 4.. It will delete last input.. if I change back to dropdown 5
[07:13:12] <Ice_Strike2> last input will appear and remember the last value?
[07:13:27] <P0rk> create all the textboxes then hide/show the number
[07:13:33] <P0rk> it will remember it if it's hidden
[07:13:57] <Ice_Strike2> Ah hide/show option
[07:14:08] <Ice_Strike2> I was thinking creating more dympic
[07:14:17] <Ice_Strike2> like .remove()
[07:14:38] <P0rk> if you want to go to that hassle, store your data in an array in the data attribute of the parent
[07:15:24] <rosieres> mouseenter: function(){ $(':first-child', this).css('color', 'red');} works. BUT: if I change :first-child to :after it does not work. Any ideas?
[07:16:22] <Ice_Strike2> "attribute of the parent" meaning?
[07:16:37] <P0rk> one sec..
[07:17:18] <Ice_Strike2> like global array
[07:22:01] <rosieres> http://jsfiddle.net/271buagf/ Here's a fiddle of my :after problem -> le:after should change color on hover, but it does not
[07:22:57] <rosieres> any help welcome
[07:27:35] <shoky> rosieres: you can't change the :after css like that.  just use :hover in the css  http://jsfiddle.net/271buagf/1/
[07:29:17] <shoky> rosieres: and if you really wanted to do it with jquery, just use a class. http://jsfiddle.net/271buagf/2/
[07:32:09] <Ice_Strike2> P0rk you there?
[07:33:39] <P0rk> mess. working on the last typeo   http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/jxggb0q7/11/
[07:35:41] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/jxggb0q7/13/
[07:35:51] <P0rk> works better. Still ugly, but that's my specialty.
[07:36:26] <Ice_Strike2> Thank you :)
[07:36:55] <P0rk> basically, it stores your old input values in the parent div's data-result element   then, whenever the select changes, rebuilds based on the selects input and the data-result attribute
[07:37:13] <P0rk> data-result attribute, not element. sorry
[07:38:10] <Ice_Strike2> I understand
[07:38:15] <Ice_Strike2>   var res=oldres||[];
[07:38:17] <Ice_Strike2> What this?
[07:38:43] <P0rk> sets the res array to the old res value if it exists or (||) new array[] if it doesnt
[07:39:07] <Ice_Strike2> Ahh ok thanks
[07:39:12] <Ice_Strike2> What is other way writing this
[07:39:25] <P0rk> similar to:   if(oldres!=undefined) {res=oldres;} else {res=[]}
[07:39:35] <Ice_Strike2> Got it.
[07:39:38] <shoky> Ice_Strike2 here's the hide/show way.. http://jsfiddle.net/01dwu38o/
[07:40:03] <P0rk> see, that's the way I'd do it too. LOL
[07:40:11] <Ice_Strike2> lol
[07:40:22] <Ice_Strike2> Look tidy and clean
[07:40:29] <Ice_Strike2> I might go with that method
[07:40:34] <P0rk> but watch shoky do it the dynamic way in 5 lines. He's the genius
[07:41:00] <midori-rus> hello there, Can anybody help me. I have a input field which works with autocomplete. Is it possible to make search by two independent words?
[07:41:38] <P0rk> midori-rus, make a fiddle with your working example and it'll be easier to answer
[07:41:53] <Ice_Strike2> If I refresh the pages - how to repopulate it?
[07:42:03] <Ice_Strike2> I will save data in PHP
[07:42:07] <P0rk> store the data in a cookie
[07:42:32] <P0rk> if you are storing the data in php, the ajax it out and rebuild your fields based on the ajaxed data
[07:42:48] <shoky> midori-rus: it's possible with jquery-ui autocomplete, would take a bit of work though
[07:43:13] <shoky> no idea if it's possible with browser's autocomplete, i'd guess not
[07:43:58] <midori-rus> shoky: yeah. there is jquery-ui autocomplete in my form
[07:44:11] <P0rk> shoky, do you know if .serialize takes into account php-object naming when serializing?
[07:45:09] <caraconan> Hi there. I'm able to manually show/hide a JQM Loader widget the first time, but not the second. http://paste.debian.net/130564/ Any help will be appreciated. Thanks
[07:45:15] <krambiorix> I have an anchor and when clicking on it , it opens a file download dialog. I want to use this to send it as an attachment with mailto... How can i do that?
[07:45:42] <P0rk> i guess not now that I am fiddling it. UGG
[07:46:24] <Ice_Strike2> var num = $(this).val();   or var num = Number(this.value);
[07:46:28] <Ice_Strike2> what the difference?
[07:46:48] <P0rk> technically $(this).val() is not a number
[07:47:25] <shoky> midori-rus: well you can have full control of how the search works with jquery-ui autocomplete. either on the client or on the server
[07:47:52] <shoky> P0rk: no idea what php-object is. i doubt jquery gives a shit about anything php :P
[07:48:36] <midori-rus> shoky: I thought I should just set a parametr
[07:48:37] <P0rk> it's nice to be able to use name='contact[name]' and   name='contact[address]' to get a single 'contact' object with two properties,
[07:48:38] <shoky> Ice_Strike2:  this.value  and $(this).val()  are the same.  Number(..) makes sure it's a number and not a string
[07:49:23] <shoky> midori-rus: you set the "source" parameter, yes ;)
[07:49:59] <Ice_Strike2> Ah ok
[07:50:24] <krambiorix> is it possible to open the mail client and attach a file?
[07:51:20] <shoky> doubt it
[07:54:13] <Ice_Strike2> Why does this not hide?
[07:54:19] <Ice_Strike2> line.slice(lineVal).hide().slideDown('fast');
[07:54:30] <Ice_Strike2> it work when I remove slideDown('fast');
[07:55:02] <shoky> `api slideDown
[07:55:02] <b-ot> shoky: .slideDown(): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[07:55:55] <rosieres> @shoky thanks mate
[08:00:12] <Ice_Strike2> Ah, slideUp work fine
[08:03:12] <caraconan> No way. After invoke the hide method apparently I need to re-instantiate the page loader widget somehow...
[08:04:38] <krambiorix> how can i prevent the browser from caching my jquery scripts?
[08:05:06] <krambiorix> i read something that adding ?v=2 to the filename should work? Is that a good way?

[08:23:11] <Ice_Strike2> I have seen this but it is not that

[08:40:01] <jeffreylevesque> how can i call a jquery file from another file
[08:40:51] <RTPMatt> @jeffreylevesque if jquery is loaded on the page, you can just use it.
[08:41:08] <jeffreylevesque> i want to conditionally use it
[08:41:24] <jeffreylevesque> ok, i will try to call the jquery method
[08:41:37] <jeffreylevesque> just make sure the method definition is defined in the file before the file calling it
[08:42:13] <RTPMatt> This may be what you are looking for: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[08:46:21] <jeffreylevesque> I need to make my method global i think
[08:52:31] <GFXDude> I'm using jqueryUI, and have a <header> with three divs, displayed inline so that they are side-by-side. However, I cannot get ui-widget-header to work if they are displayed inline
[08:52:55] <GFXDude> The theme formatting seems to be applied to the 4px padding-right when I have display:inline set
[09:00:32] <Duvdevan> can someone invite me to #twitter-bootstrap ?
[09:00:39] <Duvdevan> or to #bootstrap
[09:01:52] <robertmaxrees> don't need an invite.
[09:01:57] <robertmaxrees> register your account.
[09:02:27] <robertmaxrees> also, you want ##bootstrap i'm guessing.
[09:04:28] <Jagst3r21> Hi
[09:05:27] <Jagst3r21> I have a form in drupal that I cannot modify directly so I have to do it via jQuery. Right now there are just 10 different radio buttons. One is for shipping and it triggers the shipping info form on the bottom
[09:06:41] <Jagst3r21> the other buttons are for pickup, but I reworked it into two radio buttons, and when you click the pickup option it triggers a dropdown
[09:07:22] <Jagst3r21> now I have to make it so the dropdown values it grabs sync up with the radio buttons...e.g. I will need it so whena  user selects the dropdown it selects the radio button...
[09:07:29] <Jagst3r21> here is my code so far: http://hastebin.com/tacojanavo.js
[09:08:06] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[09:08:30] <robertmaxrees> can you setup a fiddle showing what you're tyring to do?
[09:08:56] <robertmaxrees> also - you want the change event for form inputs, and you want to use .prop(), not .attr() for forms.
[09:12:23] <Jagst3r21> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/yjxwr6p6/
[09:13:03] <Jagst3r21> right above shipping services is where I insert the div
[09:13:11] <robertmaxrees> err, can you make this more paired down?
[09:17:48] <Jagst3r21> http://jsfiddle.net/yjxwr6p6/1/
[09:17:54] <Jagst3r21> ^ robertmaxrees
[09:18:13] <robertmaxrees> awesome ty.
[09:18:58] <robertmaxrees> where's the dropdown?
[09:19:02] <robertmaxrees> i see a bunch of radios
[09:19:12] <Jagst3r21> the first two
[09:19:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:19:26] <Jagst3r21> Standard Shipping, 3 - 5 business days: $0.00 and Select a Pickup Option
[09:19:33] <robertmaxrees> oh, the radios
[09:19:47] <Jagst3r21> yeah im going to display none the other ones
[09:19:50] <Jagst3r21> those two are wht matter
[09:20:13] <Jagst3r21> that*
[09:20:26] <robertmaxrees> first off, give those two radios the same name attre
[09:20:55] <robertmaxrees> that way selecting one deselects the other.
[09:21:12] <robertmaxrees> second, you want this so when you select "standard" is also selects the other "standard"?
[09:22:08] <Jagst3r21> selecting ones does de-check the other
[09:22:22] <robertmaxrees> not with what you just showed me.
[09:22:31] <MarioD> Hmmm are we allowed to ask non jquery questions in here? :-P
[09:23:03] <robertmaxrees> MarioD it depends.
[09:23:17] <robertmaxrees> javascript questions are OK, PHP questions, not so much.
[09:23:18] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:23:27] <robertmaxrees> there's no hard and fast rule about it.
[09:23:32] <MarioD> it's more of a folder alias question :-P
[09:23:53] <robertmaxrees> you can try, but you probably won't have much luck.
[09:24:03] <MarioD> are you on a mac by any chance robert?
[09:24:06] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:24:15] <MarioD> darn ok nm :-P
[09:24:48] <Jagst3r21> robertmaxrees when i click the second one it shows the dropdown, then when i click the first it deselects the second radio and hides the dropdown
[09:25:39] <robertmaxrees> btw "dropdown" is a pretty specific control - that's not what you're using here.  and if you're controlling the deselect functionality via JS you're munging things.
[09:26:28] <Jagst3r21> hmm
[09:26:33] <Jagst3r21> im confused haha
[09:26:43] <Jagst3r21> what i have works, and i can clean it later
[09:26:50] <robertmaxrees> err...
[09:26:59] <robertmaxrees> you're going to keep digging a hole that'll be harder and harder to "clean"
[09:27:05] <Jagst3r21> ohh
[09:27:06] <Jagst3r21> hmm :/
[09:27:26] <robertmaxrees> so let's start over.  you have two groups of radio buttons, right?
[09:27:43] <maddtech> I'm using bootstrap and I have two menus.  When in mobile view, if I click the button to expand menu1, it works.  But when I click button to expand menu 2 it works but 1 is still open.
[09:27:46] <Jagst3r21> one big set of radio buttons
[09:28:00] <maddtech> How can I can I make an already expanded item close and the new one expand?
[09:28:00] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r21 err, i thought one set of buttons shows/hides the other?
[09:28:05] <Jagst3r21> 2 being injected above the form because of the stupid way this form is being made in drupal
[09:28:20] <robertmaxrees> right - so treat that as two sets of radios :)
[09:28:29] <Jagst3r21> oh right
[09:29:56] <robertmaxrees> we're going to mock up the test case to show the basic idea, ok Jagst3r21?
[09:31:15] <Jagst3r21> ok sounds good
[09:33:07] <maddtech> Can anyone help?
[09:33:52] <robertmaxrees> maddtech try ##bootstrap
[09:34:54] <maddtech> well I was looking for jquery script to do this so that's why I cam here robertmaxrees
[09:35:28] <robertmaxrees> you mentioned bootstrap, so I'd assume they'd have a solution for you.  did you try asking there?
[09:36:24] <maddtech> yes and they said I needed to use javascript to do this.
[09:37:36] <robertmaxrees> okay - can you show us a paired down example of what you've got?
[09:37:53] <robertmaxrees> generally you'd have an event listener that'll find currently opened ones and close them.
[09:37:58] <Baluse> http://raw.pro-chan.com/Raw/t/674_1382207920 jqueryy
[09:37:58] <Jagst3r21> me?
[09:38:06] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r21 no, talking to maddtech
[09:38:10] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r21 i'm working on your example.
[09:38:11] <Jagst3r21> ohh
[09:38:15] <Jagst3r21> thnx
[09:38:19] <Jagst3r21> appreciate it
[09:41:46] <robertmaxrees> jesus this isn't my day.  need more caffeine
[09:42:46] <Jagst3r21> lol
[09:43:07] <robertmaxrees> good lord.  need to fix up my mirc scripts >.>
[09:46:56] <Ice_Strike> Why $(".number-lines").trigger('change'); does not work in the $(".xxxx").click(function(e) { }  ?
[09:48:40] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r21 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4sv6kuk6/ here you go.
[09:48:53] <robertmaxrees> you want something more akin to this, given your current situation.
[09:49:08] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike because click and change are two different events.
[09:49:21] <Jagst3r21> ohh alright
[09:49:35] <Jagst3r21> and how might I match the dropdown selection with the radio button?
[09:49:37] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r21 see the basic idea?  let the form control most of the logic for you.
[09:49:50] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r21 again, you aren't using a dropdown.
[09:49:56] <robertmaxrees> you're using radio buttons.
[09:50:04] <robertmaxrees> and that logic is in ther.e
[09:50:31] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4sv6kuk6/2/ this hsows that part in action.
[10:07:53] <Linkeh_> robertmaxrees: channel is still key's fyi

[10:09:49] <robertmaxrees> should be fine yeah?
[10:14:23] <Tertiary> Hi, I'm trying to use jQuery UI, but it seemingly won't load.
[10:15:15] <Tertiary> I've set it up like this in the head of my html document:
[10:15:39] <Tertiary> First, "<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>"
[10:16:00] <Tertiary> Then some other javascript links
[10:16:13] <Tertiary> Then <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.11.2/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
[10:16:56] <Tertiary> But I keep getting "ui is not defined" when I try to run ui.droppable
[10:17:16] <Tertiary> *use* ui.droppable I mean
[10:17:57] <Tertiary> I've also tried downloading it and using local links, but that doesn't work either
[10:18:47] <Tertiary> Do anyone know what I could be doing wrong?
[10:20:10] <rhp> does the demo work for you? http://jqueryui.com/droppable/
[10:20:31] <Tertiary> Hang on, gonna check
[10:20:51] <Tertiary> Yup, it does
[10:21:24] <rhp> you're not running your site of file:// right? but from an actual webserver?
[10:21:37] <RTPMatt> Tertiary: it should be more like $("#foo").droppable(), no?
[10:21:54] <Tertiary> the other files are all local
[10:22:10] <Tertiary> In the same folder as the html document I'm currently working on
[10:22:18] <rhp> as in localhost? or as in file://
[10:22:41] <Tertiary> As in file://
[10:22:56] <rhp> can you check what RTPMatt said
[10:23:02] <rhp> and run your site from an webserver?
[10:23:44] <Tertiary> I could try, but I'm not exactly experienced with that
[10:24:07] <rhp> alright, what are you using for developing now?
[10:24:37] <Tertiary> Should I get me a cheap website to try it on, or is there a free alternative?
[10:24:55] <Tertiary> I've just worked on assignments so far, haven't needed to upload anything yet
[10:24:58] <rhp> you can develop locally, but I really recommend a small webserver
[10:25:04] <Aro2220> I like having a cheap vps to play around with. Check out lowendbox.com
[10:25:06] <rhp> are you on Windows=
[10:25:06] <rhp> ?
[10:25:09] <Tertiary> Yup
[10:25:11] <Tertiary> Windows 8
[10:25:41] <rhp> alright, there are a lot of options, but you could try WebMatrix from Microsoft
[10:25:42] <rhp> http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/
[10:25:56] <rhp> its very easy and straightforward
[10:26:20] <Tertiary> Ok, I'll do that
[10:26:21] <rhp> you can just open your folder as a site in Webmatrix. Then right-click on your index.html or whatever you've named your page, then Click Browse
[10:26:23] <Tertiary> Thanks
[10:26:33] <rhp> it'll start a small local webserver (iisexpress)
[10:26:36] <rhp> good luck
[10:28:11] <Tertiary> Thanks, I'm gonna need it
[10:28:46] <rhp> starting something is often difficult ;)
[10:29:11] <Tertiary> It's honestly pretty worrying when you get an issue that stumps all the other students and makes the lecturer allude to hauntings
[10:29:25] <Tertiary> If I interpreted it right
[10:29:40] <Tertiary> He also told me to copy over all the functioning code to a new document
[10:29:57] <Tertiary> You know, to get rid of leftovers and old commented-out stuff
[10:30:10] <robertmaxrees> it's all about minimal testing imo
[10:30:25] <Tertiary> It all works perfectly until the moment I try to add anything related to jQuery UI
[10:31:04] <Tertiary> Anyhow, the webserver rhp recommended just got installed, so I'll be back in a moment.
[10:32:32] <gavit> is there anything table related for jquery that includes sorting, filtering, row selection pagination?
[10:33:09] <robertmaxrees> there are a lot of plugins and libraries fr it.
[10:33:34] <robertmaxrees> dataables is a favorite, though I'm not familiar with it.
[10:35:32] <Tertiary> Ok rhp, I'm at the final stage of the Web Platform installer, and I'm getting a long, long, list of optional programs to install, which should I pick?
[10:35:38] <Tertiary> As said, I'm new at this
[10:36:01] <Tertiary> Actually, I think it might just have been alluded to
[10:36:06] <rhp> which options?
[10:36:18] <rhp> which options do you get I mean
[10:36:37] <Tertiary> There are three different lists, each with their own products in them
[10:36:43] <Tertiary> "Spotlight"
[10:36:45] <Tertiary> "Products"
[10:36:50] <Tertiary> and "applications"
[10:37:02] <Tertiary> The last one has things like WordPress and Joomla!
[10:37:04] <jeffreylevesque> how do i make php pages not accessible other than through ajax?
[10:37:07] <jeffreylevesque> so, ppl can't type the url into the browser, and see parts of the rendered ajax-php code
[10:37:12] <rhp> oh, ignore those Tertiary
[10:37:20] <Tertiary> Ok
[10:38:51] <Tertiary> So my only options are "Install" and "Exit"
[10:39:00] <rhp> alright, install
[10:39:08] <Tertiary> and "install" only works when I've selected some applications
[10:39:29] <rhp> can you post a screenshot?
[10:39:39] <Tertiary> Wait, now it works
[10:39:58] <rhp> good
[10:40:11] <Tertiary> I used "exit" and then started it again, and got the same thing as what I thought was the last part of the installation process
[10:40:15] <Tertiary> But then that disappeared
[10:40:31] <Tertiary> And when I launched it again I got Window Webmatrix up
[10:40:41] <Tertiary> I probably just misclicked or something
[10:40:58] <rhp> jeffreylevesque, I guess you could use a token or something, but it seems like almost impossible to enforce
[10:41:11] <jeffreylevesque> that's what i'm reading
[10:41:15] <jeffreylevesque> should i create a token from js
[10:41:20] <jeffreylevesque> and pass to php via ajax
[10:41:30] <jeffreylevesque> or should i imlement
[10:41:32] <jeffreylevesque> http://www.minitek.gr/blog/how-to-block-direct-access-to-php-file-called-by-ajax-function
[10:41:34] <rhp> alright Tertiary, are you on the startpage of WebMatrix?
[10:42:02] <Tertiary> Yup
[10:42:12] <rhp> ok, so choose folder as site
[10:42:17] <rhp> then navigate to your folder
[10:42:27] <Tertiary> I can choose to sign up to Windows Azure, but I have the option to click "not now"
[10:42:34] <rhp> jeffreylevesque, it's sounds useless in my eyes really...
[10:42:40] <rhp> security through obscurity
[10:42:49] <rhp> choose not now, yoiu don't need azure
[10:42:56] <Tertiary> Ok
[10:44:00] <Tertiary> Ok, added the folder with all the relevant files
[10:44:31] <rhp> one of those files is your main html file, right?
[10:44:58] <Tertiary> Yup
[10:45:06] <Tertiary> Publish?
[10:45:09] <rhp> right-click that, choose "Launch in Browser"
[10:45:14] <Tertiary> Ok
[10:45:39] <rhp> you'll see an address like "http://localhost:47096/"
[10:45:52] <rhp> which is your localcomputer, on a specific port
[10:47:01] <Tertiary> Yup, it seems to work
[10:47:07] <rhp> very good
[10:48:34] <rhp> I hope you´re using a good browser too (Chrome or Firefox) and learn how to use the developer tools to learn how to debug
[10:48:36] <rhp> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools
[10:48:44] <robertmaxrees> IE has good dev tools now, as well.
[10:49:14] <Tertiary> I'm using both!
[10:49:18] <rhp> it has improved massively I agree, but Chrome's and Firefox still work a lot more intuively to me (so yes, subjective :P)
[10:49:20] <Tertiary> Well, Chrome and Waterfox
[10:49:34] <robertmaxrees> don't use waterfox imo.
[10:49:39] <robertmaxrees> chrome, ff, and IE.
[10:49:40] <robertmaxrees> imo
[10:49:54] <robertmaxrees> at least when you're testing stuff.
[10:49:56] <Tertiary> Firefox has 64x support now, right?
[10:50:13] <robertmaxrees> not yet.
[10:50:16] <robertmaxrees> iirc
[10:50:23] <Tertiary> Yeah, waterfox started behaving strangely lately, so I started using chrome for testing
[10:53:28] <Tertiary> So the localhost version is now up, locally at least
[10:53:35] <Tertiary> Still getting the same problem
[10:53:48] <robertmaxrees> what was the problem?
[10:54:05] <rhp> do you have file:// references in your html?
[10:54:12] <Tertiary> yes
[10:54:18] <robertmaxrees> that won't work.
[10:54:19] <rhp> you need to get red of those
[10:54:26] <Tertiary> That'll be problematic
[10:54:33] <robertmaxrees> those need to be http:// OR just drop the protocol entirely.
[10:54:37] <rhp> yup
[10:54:43] <robertmaxrees> protocol / domain.
[10:54:54] <robertmaxrees> so just /path/to/file.js
[10:55:41] <Tertiary> They're written into the document like this:
[10:55:43] <Tertiary> "<script type="text/javascript" src="lab2-boardEvent.js"></script>"
[10:55:52] <jampekka> Is there some kind of "dom-update" queue in jQuery (or chromium)? I'm changing UI in a video timechange event which may trigger quite rapidly. However, sometimes the dom doesn't update to the new values. Console-logging shows that the functions are called with proper parameters.
[10:56:07] <jampekka> And the changes get visible after I eg. move a mouse
[10:56:17] <robertmaxrees> jampekka not necessarily.  sounds like you're doing something funky.
[10:56:33] <rhp> Tertiary, can you paste your main html file in like something like http://pastebin.com/
[10:56:42] <robertmaxrees> or fixee.org ?
[10:57:00] <rhp> ooh nice, didnt know that one
[10:57:08] <robertmaxrees> better because no advertising ;)
[10:57:12] <rhp> :P
[10:57:34] <Tertiary> Sure, gonna put it onto fixee
[10:58:00] <jampekka> robertmaxrees: That's always an option :) But I have something like console.log(time); $("#anelement").text(time); and the log and the UI values don't match (the UI shows previous value).
[10:58:23] <robertmaxrees> jampekka then you have something else going on.
[10:58:26] <Tertiary> It's probably gonna be a complete mess, as I am a first-semester student with no prior experience with any of this
[10:58:31] <robertmaxrees> Tertiary that's fine.
[10:58:38] <jampekka> Hmm.. maybe I'll try to replicate it in a simpler script
[10:58:39] <rhp> jampekka, these two lines are right next to each other?
[10:58:57] <rhp> could the value be changed in between thse calls if it's updated so often?
[10:59:07] <robertmaxrees> lots of factors at play for that one.
[10:59:42] <jampekka> rhp: Yes. Right next to each other. And that element shouldn't be changed anywhere else
[11:00:09] <robertmaxrees> jampekka as far as you know ;)
[11:00:29] <jampekka> I suspected at first that the browser may change the video.currentTime value even within callback, but passing it to a different variable doesn't change the behavior
[11:00:34] <rhp> if you could replicate it in a simpler script, as you said, that'd be great
[11:00:42] <rhp> (make a fiddle)
[11:00:58] <jampekka> Yeah, I asked before the test-case just in case this is a known issue
[11:01:42] <robertmaxrees> the test case is generally more for you than it is for us :)
[11:03:03] <Tertiary> Here's my most beautiful creation:
[11:03:04] <Tertiary> http://fixee.org/paste/4nkv4pn/
[11:03:34] <robertmaxrees> you have some bad HTML.
[11:03:36] <robertmaxrees> fix that first.
[11:04:00] <robertmaxrees> line 212 - you have an extra quote in front of the name attribute.
[11:04:20] <robertmaxrees> line 23 - extra <
[11:04:37] <robertmaxrees> and put the jquery ui include right after the jquery include
[11:04:40] <Tertiary> I saw that
[11:04:50] <robertmaxrees> so jquery, then jquery ui, then everything else.
[11:04:52] <Tertiary> Must've copied something over incorrectly
[11:04:56] <Tertiary> Ok
[11:05:00] <Tertiary> Gonna try that
[11:05:13] <robertmaxrees> and those files are in the same folder as this html file?
[11:06:06] <rhp> also, if you need an example of droppable, go to http://jqueryui.com/droppable/ then click on the link View Source and look how the references are made
[11:06:07] <Tertiary> Like this?:
[11:06:07] <Tertiary> http://fixee.org/paste/4nkv4pn/#url=06sxyla
[11:06:20] <robertmaxrees> yes, like that.
[11:06:20] <Tertiary> I did, many times over
[11:06:27] <Tertiary> I've also read a lot on the widget page
[11:07:09] <Tertiary> I had over a page of shitty commented out code about droppables
[11:07:30] <Tertiary> This version of the document has gotten trimmed a lot of old commented-out code removed
[11:07:50] <robertmaxrees> also, in iterators, you need to declare your index variable - for (var i = 0; i < boardSize; i++) {
[11:08:05] <Tertiary> I'll try that
[11:08:14] <robertmaxrees> these are general touch-ups btwe.
[11:08:31] <robertmaxrees> when doing comparisons, use === instead of ==
[11:09:07] <robertmaxrees> also, ui.draggable isn't defined anywhere - not sure what you're expecting that to be.
[11:09:31] <Tertiary> ok
[11:10:07] <robertmaxrees> you're calling $("div").droppable() in a loop - see if you can't avoid that.  that's begging for pain.
[11:10:37] <Tertiary> Ok, gonna move that out of the loop
[11:11:08] <robertmaxrees> any time you create a new variable, you need to put var in front of it to define it for that scope.
[11:11:16] <Tertiary> It was originally under "if (checker)"
[11:11:18] <Tertiary> ok
[11:11:26] <robertmaxrees> your randomChecker and randomLoc aren't properly declared.
[11:12:36] <robertmaxrees> in cases like board.addEventListener('add',function (e) {, you don't need to pass the "e" arg if you're not going to use it.  there are functions later on like $("#btnClear").click(function(evt) { where you're not using them.  don't include them.
[11:12:48] <robertmaxrees> and use javascript event binding or jquery event binding.  don't mix and match them :)
[11:13:59] <Tertiary> That part of the code came in the "default" document we based our assignment on
[11:14:07] <robertmaxrees> which is?
[11:14:10] <Tertiary> addEventListener
[11:14:18] <robertmaxrees> err...
[11:14:39] <robertmaxrees> then use native javascript event bindings.  otherwise you're going to hurt later on :)
[11:14:46] <robertmaxrees> or replace them if you can.
[11:14:51] <Tertiary> Ok
[11:15:25] <Tertiary> "board.addEventListener" and some other parts of the document were made by the teacher
[11:15:33] <jampekka> This reproduces the bug: http://jsfiddle.net/523py91b/3/
[11:15:36] <Tertiary> We didn't start the assignment on a blank slate, so to speak
[11:15:40] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.  just pointing out stuff for you to know.
[11:15:51] <robertmaxrees> native events and jquery events are in two different "spaces"
[11:16:17] <Tertiary> And I'm happy that you do
[11:16:23] <Tertiary> point that out, I mean
[11:16:30] <robertmaxrees> jampekka in chrome only, right?
[11:16:33] <jampekka> However, very likely not a jquery-bug as sometimes also the log gets "stuck" before zero even though the display goes to zero.
[11:16:39] <Tertiary> I appreciate learning it
[11:16:59] <Tertiary> What did you mean by "native events and jquery events are in two different "spaces""
[11:17:13] <robertmaxrees> they're not the same things.
[11:17:15] <Tertiary> Does it mean that they should be or shouldn't be
[11:17:16] <Tertiary> Ok
[11:17:26] <robertmaxrees> jquery "click" and dom "click" are different.
[11:17:40] <Tertiary> I see
[11:18:02] <robertmaxrees> jampekka i can't get the bug to happen in chrome.
[11:18:05] <jampekka> robertmaxrees: Doesn't seem to happen on Firefox. Although on firefox the countdown is very slow
[11:18:14] <robertmaxrees> it's very fast on FF for me.
[11:19:10] <robertmaxrees> what's with the timeout, jampekka?
[11:19:32] <jampekka> Seems to get slow on FF only if the log is open
[11:19:58] <robertmaxrees> ah, you need queueing.
[11:20:04] <jampekka> robertmaxrees: Emulating async timeupdate events
[11:20:07] <robertmaxrees> i can't get the bug to trigger either way.
[11:20:19] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/523py91b/7/
[11:20:28] <robertmaxrees> avoid inline event handlers btw.
[11:20:43] <jampekka> Yep, may be some weird bug specific to my system. And definitely not a jQuery bug
[11:20:50] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:21:17] <jampekka> The inline handler was just a quick hack
[11:21:32] <robertmaxrees> don't do "quick hacks" like that ;)
[11:21:49] <jampekka> The whole testcase was a quick hack ;)
[11:22:20] <robertmaxrees> it's faster to do the event binding in js anyway imo.  but okay
[11:22:48] <jampekka> (And I do like that inline-handlers declare the element and the functionality in same place. But they do have their problems too)
[11:23:01] <robertmaxrees> noooo.
[11:23:10] <robertmaxrees> don't give your document knowledge of its logic.
[11:23:52] <robertmaxrees> brb
[11:23:53] <jampekka> Yep, I appreciate the divide
[11:23:57] <Tertiary> Well, I added "var ui" to my jQuery segment, without adding any details, I have know gotten a new error message
[11:24:00] <Tertiary> This is progress
[11:24:08] <Tertiary> And yes, I'm actually kinda happy about this
[11:24:22] <Tertiary> I've been staring at that damn error message all day
[11:24:38] <Tertiary> Nice to see something new, even if it's just another error message
[11:24:51] <Tertiary> Which is only there because var ui doesn't have any properties yet
[11:25:12] <jampekka> But developing on web stuff is such a mess that occasional mixing of layout and logic is quite a minor ugliness in comparison ;)
[11:25:28] <Tertiary> Originally I thought that "ui" was a variable from the jQuery UI document
[11:25:40] <Tertiary> Based most of my logic on that
[11:25:41] <Robdgreat> anyone know a prefab solution for dynamically adding elements or groups of elements to a form?
[11:26:50] <Tertiary> Current error is "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'draggable' of undefined "
[11:27:22] <Tertiary> Which I get on a line for .append(ui.draggable)
[11:27:44] <Tertiary> Which is because I didn't add any info to "var ui", right?
[11:36:18] <piklu> Bored geeks - requesting you to join #lifechat - fun and any kind of talking.
[11:37:07] <Robdgreat> already in a few such channels, but thanks for the spam
[11:38:10] <piklu> Robdgreat: sorry if u feel spamming, just trying to collect few bored geeks
[11:38:18] <Robdgreat> ok
[11:41:24] <doug64k> Tertiary: ui is a parameter that jquery-ui passes to you in events
[11:41:49] <Tertiary> Ok, so I'm NOT supposed to make it a variable
[11:42:10] <Tertiary> Or?
[11:42:25] <doug64k> Tertiary: well, adding a ui parameter to the right place "makes a variable" (a parameter is a variable), it just gets set for you when it gets called
[11:42:49] <doug64k> Tertiary: I am starting to sound cryptic... 1 sec
[11:43:28] <doug64k> Tertiary: go here and click that annoying Show API link -> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/
[11:43:48] <doug64k> Tertiary: now, on the right it says the events that can be fired...
[11:44:07] <doug64k> go to one and look at how they write the callback function, it has a ui parameter
[11:44:10] <robertmaxrees> back
[11:49:38] <Tertiary> Like here, right?:
[11:49:47] <Tertiary>  // setter $( ".selector" ).draggable( "option", "revertDuration", 200 );
[11:50:37] <Tertiary> With "reverDuration" being a callback to:
[11:50:39] <Tertiary> "// getter var revertDuration = $( ".selector" ).draggable( "option", "revertDuration" );"
[11:51:04] <Tertiary> Pasting in IRC does bad things to formatting
[11:52:07] <Tertiary> I think I get it
[11:52:14] <Tertiary> Which probably means I'm not
[11:52:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:52:24] <robertmaxrees> you're off :)
[11:52:25] <BillCriswell> Tertiary: Haha.
[11:52:41] <robertmaxrees> $( ".selector" ).draggable( "option", revertDuration, 200 );
[11:52:41] <BillCriswell> I just did a bunch of draggable stuff if there's anything I can help with.
[11:52:56] <robertmaxrees> you're mixing up strings and object names
[11:53:13] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: That doesn't seem right.
[11:53:35] <robertmaxrees> i could be off, but that seems right to me.
[11:54:52] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: It's setting an option.
[11:55:01] <robertmaxrees> aaaah so it's not a callback.
[11:55:22] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Ah ok, not I understand what you were thinking lol.
[11:55:36] <robertmaxrees> yeah just going off of what he was saying.
[11:56:23] <BillCriswell> s/not/now
[12:00:35] <krambiorix> i read something that adding ?v=2 to the filename should work? Is that a good way?
[12:00:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:00:49] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[12:01:20] <doug64k> krambiorix: ?v=2 wouldn't be part of the filename, it would be the query string on a url
[12:01:33] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, because when i modify my script, chrome uses the cached version
[12:01:47] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix oh, you're trying to cachebust.
[12:01:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah you can do ?v=randomnumber
[12:01:59] <krambiorix> ow ok
[12:02:01] <krambiorix> thanks guys
[12:02:01] <robertmaxrees> where randomnumber is whatever you want.
[12:02:12] <robertmaxrees> or disable js caching in dev tools.
[12:02:27] <doug64k> krambiorix: if you keep using 2 it wont keep working. the whole idea is to make it change whenever you want to force everyone to get a new copy
[12:03:04] <robertmaxrees> open your dev tools, click the gear icon in the upper right, and select the disable cache option.
[12:03:21] <robertmaxrees> then just have your dev tools open and you're good to go.
[12:05:24] <krambiorix> doug64k, yes, i'm aware of that :)
[12:05:54] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, yes, for development, not for production
[12:06:20] <robertmaxrees> i thought you were talkiing about development, not production.
[12:06:35] <robertmaxrees> in those cases, yes - a cachebusting url is a good thing.
[12:06:39] <robertmaxrees> *param
[12:07:02] <krambiorix> ok, thanks again all
[12:11:40] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: I use a strong hash function and reply with a hex ETag, and that seems rock solid. why is it that people have these cache issues? They are setting aggressive expires durations?
[12:12:08] <robertmaxrees> depends totally on the case, but usually that's the issue.
[12:12:23] <robertmaxrees> i know we cache files for as long as possible at my company and then bust only when we release.
[12:13:09] <doug64k> yeah, my way requires a lot of somewhat redundant HEAD requests to check the etags
[12:13:13] <robertmaxrees> *cache both on edgecast's side AND clientside.
[12:13:23] <robertmaxrees> we keep is as simple as possible.
[12:13:26] <doug64k> er, not really HEAD, but they end up like HEAD..
[12:14:37] <doug64k> ideally you would set 1 year expires and completely rely on cachebust, right?
[12:14:48] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember what we do here tbh.
[12:15:49] <robertmaxrees> i think we set like 30 days "just in case"?  we have to serve a lot of different environments and have a weird platform so we have all these edge cases to worry about.
[12:16:11] <doug64k> in my production sites everything is 100% cacheable using etags. they still have to check to see that the server still has the same etag, but it's great for highly repetitive REST requests
[12:16:23] <robertmaxrees> i could see that.
[12:16:48] <robertmaxrees> i let our server guys handle that.
[12:17:10] <robertmaxrees> server/feo guys
[12:17:17] <doug64k> it doesn't bypass the work the server does to build the reply, but at the last moment it checks the etags and realizes, "yes, he has the response cached" and replies appropriately without the data
[12:17:42] <robertmaxrees> heh, i'm familiar with etags.
[12:17:54] <robertmaxrees> but we have a sort of... strange setup so I let other folks think about it.
[12:18:21] <doug64k> robertmaxrees: I'm sure you are, just spelling out that I do it for everything universally, which I expect isn't always done
[12:19:40] <robertmaxrees> our stack is a little unusual so there are lots of cases where things that might make sense to you don't make sense to me.
[12:19:52] <robertmaxrees> *sense for, not sense to
[12:33:52] <jeffreylevesque> how do i get the height of the html element including scrollable if exists
[12:34:10] <robertmaxrees> .height()
[12:34:47] <jeffreylevesque> that only returns the non-scrollable height for me - the current window height
[12:34:56] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're selecting the wrong thing.
[12:35:00] <robertmaxrees> go one level deeper.
[12:35:54] <jeffreylevesque> i have h = $(html).height();
[12:36:10] <ruben-> I can't find anything about this - but I have some strange behaviour on a site. When I send an Ajax POST request and the HTTP times out - it automatically resends this request to the server. Is there a way to disable this? I added a "beforeSend" for debugging purposes, but this is not repeated.
[12:36:29] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque that should be $('html')
[12:37:06] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/f23u8L0s/
[12:37:46] <robertmaxrees> try $('html').height()
[12:38:03] <jeffreylevesque> i did - not on jsfiddle
[12:38:15] <robertmaxrees> then something is wrong.
[12:38:31] <robertmaxrees> there a place i can see this problem in action?
[12:38:39] <jeffreylevesque> I'm taking the height of the 'html' and applying it to a div
[12:40:44] <robertmaxrees> you can just to $(divs).css('height', $('html').height() + 'px');
[12:40:46] <robertmaxrees> no need for that each
[12:42:25] <jeffreylevesque> much shorter
[12:42:27] <jeffreylevesque> thank you
[12:42:42] <jeffreylevesque> the js logic is correct either way
[12:42:56] <jeffreylevesque> yours is much meaner and leaner
[12:43:01] <jeffreylevesque> the html is problem
[12:43:20] <jeffreylevesque> it's height is defined as the window height somehow
[12:43:41] <ruben-> Anyone having the same issue?
[12:43:55] <jeffreylevesque> i set in my css html,body { height:100%}
[12:44:02] <jeffreylevesque> i wonder if that's why
[12:44:12] <robertmaxrees> that might do it.
[12:45:02] <jeffreylevesque> actually, without that bit of css
[12:45:08] <jeffreylevesque> the columns don't get set the same height
[12:45:22] <jeffreylevesque> i need html height:100%
[13:08:16] <tomasm-> what are some good graphing libraries (using jquery) that are easy to start with and can do things like interaction drill downs, etc?
[13:10:08] <mccarrontr1ck> in IE8 i'm getting a "Member not found" error with this line:  external 	= $('[rel^="external"]'); Any Ideas? jQuery 1.11.1
[13:13:39] <robertmaxrees> mccarrontr1ck actual IE8, or emulated IE8?
[13:14:15] <Sebboh> Hello.  So, to use jqueryui... I put a script tag in <head> for this https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.2/jquery-ui.min.js, eh?  Don't I also need to put a script tag in for jquery core? Can I use 2.x, or only 1.x?
[13:14:32] <robertmaxrees> Sebboh yes, you need jquery, then jquery uoi
[13:14:34] <robertmaxrees> *ui
[13:15:23] <robertmaxrees> most recent jquery ui supports jquery 1.6 and above.
[13:15:31] <robertmaxrees> which includes the 2.x series
[13:15:33] <Sebboh> Great, thanks!
[13:18:58] <mccarrontr1ck> nm figured it out
[13:19:10] <ThKo> Hi everyone, short question: Why is it not possible to use the variables in line 3 to 5 in the function 9 to 22? Thanks a lot! :-) http://jsfiddle.net/mbdtorgc/
[13:19:12] <mccarrontr1ck> Emulated IE8
[13:19:12] <mccarrontr1ck> i fixed the issue, i forgot to declare the variable first. added var external.... fixed it
[13:23:44] <ThKo> Any ideas? :(
[13:27:21] <cohitre> ThKo: you donât have to specify this.output. just output since itâs a scope variable
[13:28:39] <ThKo> cohitre: Oh sry, this was only from a test. this. is deleted but it doesnât work. output only contains the button
[13:57:18] <ilhami> hello anybody here?
[13:57:20] <ilhami> I have a problem
[13:57:52] <cjohnson> don't ask to ask ilhami just ask
[13:58:08] <ilhami> I have a tab panel with jQuery UI but when I try to set an active tab after a window.location.href="path" it doesnt recognize the index
[13:58:12] <ilhami> how do I solve this?
[13:58:26] <ilhami> It keeps giving me index 0
[13:58:44] <cjohnson> what is giving you index 0, what do "it doesn't recognize the index" mean?
[13:58:44] <ilhami> I have a button on my home page which should open tab index 1
[13:59:02] <cjohnson> paste an example to jsfiddle please
[13:59:11] <ilhami> but it opens index 0 every time I click on the button.. even though I used this:  $( "#motorbikes" ).click(function() {
[13:59:11] <ilhami>                 window.location.href = "vehicles-page.php";
[13:59:11] <ilhami>                 $( '#vehicles' ).tabs({ active: 1 });
[13:59:13] <ilhami> oops
[13:59:14] <ilhami> sorry
[13:59:54] <ilhami> ok let me try.
[14:02:32] <ilhami> Jsfiddle messed it up :(
[14:02:45] <ilhami> I clicked save but it didnt save. It removed all the content of the text areas
[14:03:38] <ilhami> cjohnson ... I bet you can figure it out without a jsfiddle.
[14:05:35] <cjohnson> jsfiddle didn't mess anything up... you just didn't do a good enough job of isolating and copying the issue. I can't even figure out exactly what the problem you're claiming it is
[14:05:41] <cjohnson> that's why I was hoping for a fiddle ot make it obvious
[14:08:00] <ilhami> ok let me explain from scratch.. I have a tabbed pane which I implemented with jQuery UI. I have two buttons on my home page. One for cars and one for motorbikes. Whenever I click on the "car" button I want it to set tab = index: 0 which is the default.. that works fine.. but when I click on the "motorbikes" button I want it to switch over to tab2 whenever the page is loaded. I redirect the page with window.location.href="<path>"
[14:08:00] <ilhami>  and $( "#vehicles" ).tabs( "option", "select", 1 ); just after
[14:08:11] <ilhami> I hope you understood now cjohnson ..
[14:09:22] <ilhami> I am suspecting that the window.location.href="" is preventing it from switching to tab index: 1
[14:10:10] <NoiseEee> ilhami: i don't use jqueryUI, but doesn't it load content via DOM/<div>s rather than actually changing documents/pages?
[14:11:10] <ilhami> yeah it does.. but I am redirecting a from my home page to that specific page where the tabbed pane is
[14:11:34] <NoiseEee> oh sorry. good luck then
[14:12:59] <ilhami> I dont need luck :)
[14:13:06] <ilhami> I am trying to look at the documentation
[14:13:43] <kavi> Hi am having trouble with jplayer with jquery ui slider
[14:14:00] <kavi> The sliders are there, but the track slider doesnât move the playpoint to where the slider is.
[14:14:34] <kavi> how to move the playhead to the slider
[14:27:39] <JokesOnYou77> Hi all
[14:27:48] <JokesOnYou77> I'm trying to use the contextmenu event with the 'on' function for an element that is dynamically added to the page.  it works fine with bind, but I can't get it to work with on.
[14:29:36] <danim> hi. I'm trying to set the style of the autocomplete list in jquery ui. I almost have all but when the list lost the focus (for example the mouse mouse out) the last element of the list get the old style. What should I change?
[14:36:55] <sherafff> hi, is there a way to have a callback after addClass ? the class i'm adding have a transition, i want the callback to fire when the transition is done
[14:45:19] <jeffreylevesque> what's a good image minifier program
[14:45:33] <ceteriTRAIN> image minifier?
[14:45:39] <sherafff> favicon?
[14:45:51] <jeffreylevesque> do i need npm for image minifier?
[14:46:02] <ceteriTRAIN> are you talking file size, or dimension wise
[14:46:05] <sherafff> good favicon generator : realfavicongenerator.net
[14:46:15] <jeffreylevesque> file size
[14:46:31] <jeffreylevesque> i also need something like uglify
[14:46:38] <ceteriTRAIN> load it into photoshop, save for web, as png-8 or 24
[14:46:39] <jeffreylevesque> and trying to do things without grunt
[14:48:36] <Sal> hi
[14:49:08] <Sal> can someone tell me what could be the best setup for mobile apps using jquery?
[14:49:24] <Sal> possibly without using jquery mobile, because i don0t like it
[14:56:28] <robertmaxrees> what don't you like about it?
[14:58:10] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: i'm going to use bash scripts to automate things
[14:58:18] <jeffreylevesque> rather than grunt
[14:58:27] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:58:30] <jeffreylevesque> then I will use linux subkernel 'inotifywait'
[14:58:40] <jeffreylevesque> which will allow me to automate things at apache2 boot
[14:58:49] <robertmaxrees> grunt/gulp are great.
[14:59:00] <robertmaxrees> wait what are you doing?
[14:59:17] <jeffreylevesque> I will compile css, js, and maybe images
[14:59:25] <robertmaxrees> don't tie that to your server start.
[14:59:33] <robertmaxrees> also if you want a good image optimization library check out imagemagick
[15:00:12] <robertmaxrees> but don't tie minification/compilation to your server start.
[15:00:19] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: is that better than imagemin.
[15:00:20] <jeffreylevesque> why not?
[15:00:42] <robertmaxrees> need to change a server config - now you get to wait for everything else to happen before the server comes back up.
[15:00:55] <robertmaxrees> have a deploy system that handles that for you and restarts the server only if necessary.
[15:01:06] <robertmaxrees> tying the two things together that tightly doesn't really make much sense.
[15:01:42] <jeffreylevesque> haven't had much experience with deploy systems.
[15:01:56] <jeffreylevesque> i don't have much to work with.  I have a dual boot laptop
[15:01:59] <robertmaxrees> that's why you spend the time to learn.
[15:02:07] <jeffreylevesque> the dualboot is ubuntu server 14.04
[15:02:11] <robertmaxrees> don't learn to do things some weird way - learn to do them a smart way.
[15:02:18] <robertmaxrees> and use a VM if you want to experiment with linux.
[15:02:26] <robertmaxrees> but do most of your work in another OS.
[15:03:21] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: is that imagemagick better than imagemin.
[15:03:52] <robertmaxrees> they probably both do something similar./
[15:03:58] <robertmaxrees> pick one and run with it :)
[15:04:53] <robertmaxrees> we use imagemagick here when we can,
[15:05:04] <robertmaxrees> and size/crop things as appropriate.
[15:27:54] <Sal> robertmaxrees, sorry , i was afk
[15:27:58] <robertmaxrees> it's fine.
[15:28:00] <Sal> still there?
[15:28:05] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:28:11] <Sal> i don't like its graphic
[15:28:18] <Sal> its too old for me
[15:28:28] <robertmaxrees> then replace the theming or write your own.
[15:28:59] <Sal> and also, its missing a lot of mobile new stuff like bottom pull-up panels
[15:29:28] <robertmaxrees> those are things you could write yourself, but there are plenty of libraries and frameworks out there.
[15:30:05] <robertmaxrees> but "the best setup using jquery" is ephemeral.  you use jquery.
[15:30:15] <Sal> robertmaxrees, so for you, jquery+jquery UI + jquery mobile is unbeatable?
[15:30:19] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:30:20] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[15:30:31] <robertmaxrees> i don't do mobile development personally.
[15:30:46] <robertmaxrees> i am saying that you can work with the toolset to give you what you wnat.
[15:30:48] <robertmaxrees> *want
[15:31:13] <Sal> i'm searching for a nice new looking web framework that would work also on desktops and that uses jquery as the standard js part
[15:31:35] <robertmaxrees> which part of jquery mobile did you like?
[15:31:50] <Sal> ionic and framnework7 are tipically for iOS
[15:31:50] <robertmaxrees> because it sounds like you'd really rather use a responsive framework, like bootstrap.
[15:32:20] <Sal> i am using bootstrap now
[15:32:25] <robertmaxrees> then use that.
[15:32:30] <Sal> but its missing the entire mobile part
[15:32:36] <Sal> for that i mean gestures
[15:32:43] <Sal> slide, swipe, tap, etc
[15:32:52] <robertmaxrees> then grab a lib that handles that.
[15:34:22] <Sal> i know, but thats what i'm trying to avoid. if i get stuck into multiple libraries solutions, i'll get the same problems that many wordporess developers have: problems whit incompatibility, with updates and with support
[15:34:37] <robertmaxrees> nah not if you're selective about it.
[15:34:48] <robertmaxrees> write your code to be modular enough and it's easy to handle.
[15:36:06] <Sal> now, i'm using bootstrap, jquery, fastclick (to avoid the 300ms for waiting the dblclick) and i have my own solution for a material_design-like style
[15:36:18] <robertmaxrees> that's not too bad.
[15:36:26] <Sal> but i have a lot of problems
[15:36:59] <Sal> first, when i open a scrollable hidden right-left panel, when the user finishes to scroll it, the bottom main page starts scrolling
[15:37:11] <Sal> i can't find a damn way to stop it
[15:37:34] <robertmaxrees> that's not an issue with the frameworks.
[15:37:54] <Sal> bootstrap does it
[15:38:05] <Sal> even with its popover dialogs
[15:38:29] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have expectations that can't realistically be met.
[15:39:06] <Sal> imagine a data list on main view, then the user click on an item and a left panel comes in with all extra info on the item clicked
[15:40:04] <Sal> when you scroll up all the info, then the user closes the left panel and the under list should remain just where he first clicked
[15:40:18] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change the last thing I said ;)
[15:40:21] <Sal> instead, it scrolls up and the user loses focus on what he was doing
[15:40:24] <Sal> this really sux
[15:40:27] <robertmaxrees> you could set that up yourself.
[15:40:37] <robertmaxrees> or swap out bootstrap for something else.
[15:40:44] <robertmaxrees> each library/framework has tradeoffs.
[15:41:14] <Sal> yep, thats true
[15:41:31] <Sal> but that means: try them all
[15:41:33] <Sal> :)
[15:41:36] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[15:41:50] <robertmaxrees> it's about knowing how to evaluate them and see which seems most appropriate for your case.
[15:42:02] <robertmaxrees> if you find yourself fighting against something a lot, it's probably not the best choice.
[15:42:20] <Sal> yep, could be
[15:42:20] <robertmaxrees> you should also have your code written modularly enough so that swapping things out isn't too big of an undertaking.
[15:42:47] <Sal> most of the new frameworks, use angular
[15:42:53] <robertmaxrees> i don't like angular personally.
[15:43:08] <Sal> but, the damn angular UI part uses flexbox
[15:43:18] <Sal> that means nothing under ie9 !!!
[15:43:28] <Sal> there are still a bunch of xp out there
[15:43:33] <robertmaxrees> err...
[15:43:40] <robertmaxrees> doesn't mean you have to support them.
[15:43:44] <robertmaxrees> only if they're worth it to you.
[15:44:10] <Sal> they are, badly
[15:44:14] <robertmaxrees> why?
[15:44:44] <Sal> i don't know where you're from, but here in italy, almost all pc in public offices are still XP
[15:45:07] <Robdgreat> "my site is upgradephobes.com and it's a support group"
[15:45:11] <Robdgreat> >.>
[15:45:25] <robertmaxrees> the US.  there are a lot of IE8/XP users, but the cost of supporting those platforms greatly outweights the revenue we get from them.
[15:45:34] <Robdgreat> Sal: that's a tragedy
[15:45:44] <Sal> yep
[15:45:50] <robertmaxrees> well, correction - we support 8, but are very close to dropping it.
[15:46:30] <Sal> anyway, angular is still not good if you want to reach all platforms
[15:46:37] <robertmaxrees> angular isn't good period.
[15:46:42] <varchar> nothing moves slower than law and dental offices.
[15:47:05] <Sal> varchar, :) right
[15:47:19] <Robdgreat> varchar: even gubmint offices?
[15:47:32] <Robdgreat> *not even
[15:47:40] <varchar> I know a few small law firms that are still on IE 7
[15:47:44] <Robdgreat> ugh
[15:48:00] <robertmaxrees> yep - we don't care to support those users.
[15:48:02] <robertmaxrees> not worth it :)

[15:55:43] <Axy> thank you robert!
[15:55:55] <Axy> robertmaxrees,
[15:56:03] <robertmaxrees> you could also store that markup in a var and reference the var instead.
[15:56:07] <Axy> I jsut learned that I could create the elements like this: var msgdiv = $("<div>" + m + "</div>");
[15:56:14] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:56:22] <Axy> and then just call fadeIn fadeOut or whatever on the element upon creation
[15:56:25] <Axy> is that a good way?
[15:56:26] <robertmaxrees> yep
[15:56:32] <Axy> (this is happening in a for loop for multiple elements)
[15:56:34] <robertmaxrees> you already have the reference.
[15:56:40] <Axy> Okay thanks! - :)
[15:57:08] <robertmaxrees> every time you run $() is expensive, so minimizing those calls is always a good idea.
[16:01:21] <Axy> robbyoconnor, here is my situation: http://pastebin.com/jSPMs0Mi
[16:01:27] <robertmaxrees> wrong username ;)
[16:01:29] <Axy> and I don2t get why the first one doens2t work
[16:01:35] <Axy> ops --- sorry :)
[16:01:45] <robertmaxrees> define "doesn't work"
[16:01:54] <Axy> "fade in" does not happen in the first one
[16:02:01] <robertmaxrees> setup a jsfiddle to demonstrate
[16:02:04] <Axy> in the second one it happens, but it just seems logically wrong
[16:02:12] <Axy> because there may be delay between creation and append
[16:02:21] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:02:26] <Axy> it's too hard for me to demonstrate right now :(
[16:02:36] <robertmaxrees> it shoudn't me.
[16:02:42] <robertmaxrees> *be.  one sec. i'll show you.
[16:02:58] <Axy> I'm very new to all this
[16:03:36] <robertmaxrees> i can tell
[16:03:47] <Axy> :)
[16:03:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jhrwgx4y/
[16:04:06] <robertmaxrees> that's how you might create a simple use case.
[16:04:53] <robertmaxrees> even better: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jhrwgx4y/2/
[16:05:03] <robertmaxrees> fully functioning.  what do you notice?
[16:05:24] <Axy> hmmm I wonder why in my example it doens2t work
[16:05:29] <Axy> you made it display npne
[16:05:37] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:05:43] <robertmaxrees> it needs a starting state.
[16:05:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, what does fadeIn() do?
[16:06:07] <Axy> but in my example, both states are exactly the same
[16:06:11] <Axy> and I don't have a starting state
[16:06:13] <Axy> pne still works
[16:06:15] <Axy> *one
[16:06:36] <robertmaxrees> sure - comment out the CSS and see it ;)
[16:06:52] <robertmaxrees> you need to set the CSS.
[16:06:54] <Axy> YEs that's it -- but why?
[16:07:00] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're relying on a funky race condition.
[16:07:05] <Axy> I mean, the bottom one works without the css
[16:07:14] <Axy> Hm
[16:07:15] <robertmaxrees> right - you're abusing a side effect.
[16:07:21] <robertmaxrees> you'd want the first one instead.
[16:07:30] <Axy> okay :)
[16:07:35] <Axy> thank you very much
[16:07:38] <robertmaxrees> yep
[16:07:42] <Axy> I think that's what wizardy is
[16:07:51] <Axy> I have a long path to follow
[16:07:52] <Axy> :D
[16:07:57] <neruda> i have a complex/nested form that I would like to expand via dynamic bootstrap tabs, what is the best way to replicate/clone the javascript form controls on the tabs with unique id for each new tab?
[16:08:14] <robertmaxrees> neruda by using .clone() ?
[16:08:21] <robertmaxrees> Axy http://learn.jquery.com/ <- this is a good resource btw.
[16:08:52] <neruda> right now I am using .append() and passing it the "partial" of the tab markup that has the controls and form fields
[16:09:02] <Axy> robertmaxrees, thank you very much! I'll definitely dig
[16:09:14] <neruda> robertmaxrees: clone() will let me specify a dynamic id?
[16:09:22] <neruda> specify or pass
[16:09:37] <robertmaxrees> neruda hrm?  i think i'm not understanding what you'reactually trying to do.
[16:09:50] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you have a form already on the page, right?
[16:09:57] <robertmaxrees> or are you building that via js as well?
[16:10:30] <neruda> I'm using RoR, the form has certain fields that use js controls (Datetimepicker, multiselect)
[16:10:39] <robertmaxrees> ror has nothing to do with it btw ;)
[16:11:03] <neruda> and when I add a tab I want the fields "cloned" in that new tab and the form controls to have new ids so the event handling fire correctly
[16:11:34] <neruda> robertmaxrees: RoR is just to give you context of all the players in the ajax request response
[16:11:50] <robertmaxrees> i don't know RoR, and that shouldn't impact anything hahaha.
[16:11:58] <robertmaxrees> but it sounds like you're convoluting things.
[16:12:07] <neruda> robertmaxrees: show me the light
[16:12:09] <neruda> plz
[16:12:19] <robertmaxrees> if you have event binding concerns (outside of the form control plugins), use event delegatuion.
[16:12:22] <robertmaxrees> *delegation
[16:13:44] <robertmaxrees> also: ditch the IDs.
[16:13:50] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need them.
[16:14:54] <neruda> robertmaxrees: got a fiddle handy that illustrates using event delegation vs id?
[16:15:03] <robertmaxrees> err, it's not "vs id"
[16:15:08] <robertmaxrees> it's just somethig you use.
[16:15:26] <neruda> ok
[16:15:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bgtjdq11/
[16:15:43] <robertmaxrees> i guess kind of shows what you want.
[16:15:53] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events is a great read
[16:51:15] <Axy> can I not declare new functions in jquery document ready function?
[16:51:21] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.
[16:51:39] <Axy> http://pastebin.com/75eFyLWv what is wrong with this then
[16:51:51] <Axy> I can't call the function from chromeconsole
[16:51:52] <robertmaxrees> what you have written there?  nothing.
[16:52:06] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to use multiply outside of the document ready?
[16:52:23] <Axy> no
[16:52:28] <Axy> just trying to call the function
[16:52:37] <robertmaxrees> right - call it outside of document ready?
[16:52:41] <Axy> Oh when I use the console, does it mean I'm otside? O_O
[16:52:46] <robertmaxrees> yes
[16:52:49] <Axy> hm okay.
[16:52:51] <robertmaxrees> that's javascript scope.
[16:53:02] <robertmaxrees> functions are a scope - you can't access anything in a different scope.
[16:53:06] <Axy> how can I call a function inside document ready, from console
[16:53:17] <robertmaxrees> you can't unless you declare the variable outside.
[16:53:31] <cohitre> Axy: why are you declaring the function inside document.ready?
[16:53:50] <robertmaxrees> functions like this one don't need to be createdin your doc ready btw.
[16:53:53] <Axy> cohitre, to use a single document ready only
[16:54:05] <robertmaxrees> you can define things outside of it btw.
[16:54:07] <cjohnson> define the functions outside the document.ready
[16:54:08] <Axy> othwerwise it will just complicate things right? I just wrapped everything into the document ready thing
[16:54:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:54:15] <cjohnson> and only run the init execution in document.ready
[16:54:20] <robertmaxrees> that's not the right way to do it necessaryly.
[16:54:49] <Axy> hm most of the tutorials I checked were like
[16:54:52] <cjohnson> the point of document.ready is to put only the code that requires the document be ready
[16:55:03] <cjohnson> any other code that doesn't rely on document being ready shouldn't really go in there
[16:55:06] <Axy> "just put those at start and end" and "do whatever you're goniing to do inside"
[16:55:07] <robertmaxrees> Axy those tutorials were trying to simplify it for you.
[16:55:07] <Axy> so yeah
[16:55:36] <cohitre> Axy: there are different ways in which you can avoid creating global variables while still allowing you to debug
[16:55:55] <Axy> hm
[16:55:58] <cohitre> a common one is to assign your functions to your a single global variable
[16:56:01] <robertmaxrees> check out fixingthesejquery.com for some good info.
[16:56:14] <Axy> okay - thank you very much
[16:56:20] <robertmaxrees> learn to use console.log() to print things to the dev console.
[16:56:20] <Axy> just a simple question before checking thoguh
[16:56:26] <d0de> Can anyone give me a hint as to how I could make this function follow an inverse hyperbolic pattern, rather than being linear? http://jsfiddle.net/6npqcw47/
[16:56:27] <Axy> what necessarily has to go inside of document ready?
[16:56:37] <robertmaxrees> Axy any code that relies on the document existing.
[16:56:45] <Axy> Oh that's all?
[16:56:47] <Axy> Okay
[16:56:47] <d0de> as in, I want the fade interval to be big at the beginning and small at the end, but still reach 0 at the end
[16:57:20] <robertmaxrees> Axy http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/aLg5fa9y/1/
[16:57:41] <robertmaxrees> d0de you want a custom easing?
[16:57:47] <robertmaxrees> oh it mathy stuff.
[16:58:22] <d0de> robertmaxrees, I don't know the word "easing" but yeah, mathy stuff :\
[16:58:23] <Axy> okay I udnerstand, thank you very much :)
[16:58:41] <robertmaxrees> d0de if you were doing animations, they'd be easings.
[16:59:04] <d0de> ah OK. It's just for a volume change function, but pretty similar to an animation I guess
[16:59:26] <robertmaxrees> could always look at the code behind http://api.jqueryui.com/easings/
[17:00:10] <d0de> that's a good idea
[17:29:48] <guideX> I am changing the class on my a tag, then, I try to detect the click, but I can't
[17:30:00] <robertmaxrees> because you broke the reference
[17:30:17] <guideX> hmm, I remove one class and add another
[17:30:23] <guideX> is this a poor way to do it?
[17:30:23] <Robdgreat> this is why we can't have nice things
[17:30:24] <robertmaxrees> same story.
[17:30:34] <guideX> then try to detect by that class tag
[17:30:49] <guideX> I use this to detect.. $('#divPermissionsProfiles').delegate('.remove_permission_button', 'click', function (e) {
[17:31:08] <guideX> but previous to that, it was a ".add_permission_button"
[17:31:27] <robertmaxrees> use .on().
[17:31:49] <guideX> hmm ok let me try..
[17:32:55] <guideX> hmm doesn't seem to work still
[17:33:04] <guideX> using this $("#divPermissionsProfiles").on("click", ".remove_permission_button", function () {
[17:33:22] <robertmaxrees> and ".remove_permission_button" is the class you've added, right?
[17:33:45] <guideX> yes, before I added it, it was .add_permission_button
[17:33:54] <robertmaxrees> then something else is wrong.  fiddle?
[17:34:00] <guideX> hmm ok
[17:34:00] <adamellsworth> is there a way to change the css value of a string of html? $(arr[index]).find('.selector').css(...)
[17:34:22] <robertmaxrees> adamellsworth as long as it's a jquery object, you can use .css()
[17:34:42] <guideX> oh wait hmm, "$(document).on("click", ".remove_permission_button", function () {" doesn't work with any button, hmm weird
[17:34:58] <robertmaxrees> don't bind to document...
[17:35:10] <robertmaxrees> a jsfiddle would be really helpful.
[17:35:16] <guideX> ok
[17:36:49] <guideX> hmm it's too much work to jsfiddle, I guess thanks anyways
[17:36:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:36:54] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:37:06] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't be for a small test case.
[17:37:17] <guideX> just cause alot is from the server side..
[17:37:23] <robertmaxrees> we don't need all of that.
[17:37:27] <robertmaxrees> just a test case ;)
[17:39:12] <guideX> yeah can't, there's a lot of server side maniuplation, nothing would be the same..
[17:39:16] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:39:20] <robertmaxrees> i'll shopw you what you need.
[17:39:36] <guideX> cause I change the button class in ajax calls and things like that
[17:39:40] <Robdgreat> oozy rats in a sanitary zoo
[17:39:42] <Robdgreat> that is all.
[17:39:49] <robertmaxrees> guideX http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cdo18hdq/
[17:39:53] <robertmaxrees> this is the basic idea.
[17:40:13] <guideX> ah ok, I'll try to replicate my problem..
[17:40:21] <robertmaxrees> might want to check to see if the thing you're binding to exists on pageload.
[17:40:57] <guideX> it does, but then I change the class
[17:41:03] <guideX> that's when I can't detect it anymore..
[17:41:09] <robertmaxrees> the classof the parent element?
[17:41:16] <guideX> the class of the a
[17:41:33] <robertmaxrees> are you replacing all of the elements, including the parent?
[17:42:17] <guideX> I have an a, which is has a class of add_permission_button ... then I click it, it removes the "add_permission_button" then adds the "remove_permission_button" class, then I can't detect the click with delegate, or on
[17:42:36] <robertmaxrees> the verison of on in the linked fiddle uses delegation btw.
[17:42:46] <robertmaxrees> that means the parent element is getting modified somehow.
[17:42:54] <cjohnson> you might want to use another class for the event binding
[17:43:02] <cjohnson> class="permission_button add_permission_button" for instance
[17:43:06] <cjohnson> and toggle the second one
[17:43:13] <robertmaxrees> that should have no impact
[17:43:22] <robertmaxrees> the delegation doesn't care what changes.
[17:43:32] <guideX> oh hmm, perhaps
[17:43:37] <cjohnson> the selector is based on the class that he's changing in the event handler right?
[17:43:55] <cjohnson> removing the class that he detected would make it stop delegating to that node
[17:43:57] <robertmaxrees> $('#parent').on('click', '.remove', function(e) { - the ".remove" only cares if the child has that class.
[17:44:07] <robertmaxrees> if he's changing the #parent, that matters.
[17:44:16] <robertmaxrees> but the .remove can get added/changed at any time.
[17:44:17] <cjohnson> it sounds like he's removing class="remove"
[17:44:48] <robertmaxrees> he changes it TO that class.
[17:44:54] <guideX> this is how i do that "$(___this).removeClass("add_permission_button").addClass("remove_permission_button");"
[17:45:08] <cjohnson> yeah, he's toggling between. so once the class falls off, the event would stop binding, I believe
[17:45:08] <robertmaxrees> ... that is ___this ?
[17:45:12] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:45:18] <robertmaxrees> becasue the parent is what you're bound to.
[17:45:19] <guideX> __this refers to the "a" which has the class
[17:45:20] <robertmaxrees> not the child.
[17:45:33] <cjohnson> if a new child is added which matches the selector, that new child will receive the event
[17:45:41] <cjohnson> so that says to me the selector is run each time the event is triggered
[17:45:42] <robertmaxrees> *it emits the evenbt
[17:45:49] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:45:56] <robertmaxrees> the .remove part.
[17:46:00] <robertmaxrees> not the $('#parent')
[17:46:05] <robertmaxrees> and nothing is re-run.
[17:46:12] <guideX> but yeah, maybe I just do something like permission_button, listen for that, then detect what I'm doing some other way
[17:46:21] <robertmaxrees> guideX you're munging something.
[17:48:25] <cjohnson> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/283npwvm/
[17:48:29] <cjohnson> click the first link, you get an alert
[17:48:38] <cjohnson> click the second one, it drops the class off the child element that the event is bound to
[17:48:42] <cjohnson> it stops alerting
[17:48:45] <robertmaxrees> right, that is not using delegation.
[17:49:05] <cjohnson> http://jsfiddle.net/283npwvm/1/
[17:49:09] <robertmaxrees> oh i see what you're saing.
[17:49:17] <robertmaxrees> you're arguing with me even though we agree.
[17:49:23] <robertmaxrees> the target element must have that class.
[17:49:28] <robertmaxrees> re-read the problem.
[17:49:36] <robertmaxrees> he's ADDING the class he's looking for.
[17:49:58] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/283npwvm/2/ like this.
[17:50:43] <guideX> ah cool
[17:51:26] <guideX> this fixed it http://pastebin.com/uNGyXuFD
[17:51:41] <guideX> thanks for the help :)
[17:51:46] <cjohnson> yeah...he's toggling back and forth I think
[17:51:49] <robertmaxrees> you have other problems, but ok.
[17:52:00] <robertmaxrees> also, don't use .attr()
[17:52:07] <guideX> what's wrong with attr?
[17:52:12] <guideX> well I guess I could research..
[17:52:13] <robertmaxrees> use .prop() for attributes, otherwise use .data() for data-attributes
[17:52:17] <guideX> ah ok
[17:52:31] <robertmaxrees> .data('permissionprofileitemid')
[17:59:42] <hasan> hi all. I use jquery hotkeys plugin and have this: $(document).bind('keypress', 's', function() { $("#start_button").trigger('click'); } );
[17:59:49] <hasan> how can I trigger this button?
[17:59:51] <robertmaxrees> 's' ?
[17:59:55] <robertmaxrees> that's not an element
[17:59:59] <hasan> yeah,. the key 's'
[18:00:04] <robertmaxrees> that's not how that works
[18:00:08] <hasan> but it works
[18:00:11] <hasan> when I hit '
[18:00:17] <hasan> 's' it opens up
[18:00:27] <hasan> (a dialog). but I want this to trigger with a code
[18:00:40] <robertmaxrees> woah that's gross.
[18:00:49] <hasan> robertmaxrees: why? that's why the plugin is for
[18:00:58] <robertmaxrees> $(document).bind('keydown', 'ctrl+a', fn); is a terrible way to do that imo.
[18:01:07] <robertmaxrees> but what you've got should work.
[18:01:30] <hasan> yeah. but as I said, I want to hit s on page load
[18:01:41] <Robdgreat> why not just trigger the click on page load
[18:01:42] <hasan> how can I trigger this on document.ready
[18:01:50] <Robdgreat> and skip the keypress
[18:01:53] <robertmaxrees> abstract out the function and call it on pageload.
[18:02:03] <Robdgreat> the trigger('click')
[18:02:03] <hasan> Robdgreat: because I need hotkeys for user interaction on the website.
[18:02:04] <robertmaxrees> don't use the DOM as a proxy for calling things.
[18:02:10] <Robdgreat> boom
[18:02:25] <robertmaxrees> hasan do you have an event listener on that button?
[18:02:32] <hasan> robertmaxrees: yes
[18:02:41] <robertmaxrees> then abstract the listener out instead and call it on load.
[18:03:03] <hasan> robertmaxrees: well I really need a button, so the user can always click s whenever he wants to
[18:03:11] <robertmaxrees> you do both is what i'm saying.
[18:03:15] <Robdgreat> m(
[18:03:23] <Robdgreat> no one's saying take out the button or the keypress
[18:03:25] <hasan> but now I only want this to trigger manually (in my code), when I close a dialog.
[18:03:32] <robertmaxrees> slow down duder.
[18:03:36] <robertmaxrees> let me show you.
[18:03:38] <hasan> ok
[18:04:05] <hasan> oh wait
[18:04:20] <hasan> my fault: I don't mean page load. I mean on "fnCreatedRow" of jquery datatables.
[18:04:28] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[18:04:31] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting things.
[18:04:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/o1qL4ztu/
[18:04:39] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[18:04:50] <hasan> $('#start_button').trigger('click'); does not work somehow. but console.log("foo") works.
[18:04:51] <robertmaxrees> don't inline the function - create a separate function you can call anywhere
[18:04:54] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[18:05:02] <hasan> ok
[18:05:03] <robertmaxrees> lol look at the fiddle i made.
[18:05:32] <robertmaxrees> don't route logic through the document - that's a great way to give yourself headaches.
[18:06:32] <hasan> ok thanks
[18:14:46] <hasan> I did it like you said
[18:15:09] <hasan> but $("#start_button").trigger('click'); does not trigger within fnCreatedRow: function() {..} of jquery datatables
[18:15:21] <hasan> everywhere else it works. but not in that function.
[18:21:08] <hasan> in that function: when I say: console.log( $("#start_button").trigger('click') ); it even gives me the right DOM object
[18:21:16] <hasan> so why does it not trigger?
[19:02:55] <Duce1nik> how do I remove an element that contain certain ID?  here the code http://jsfiddle.net/fz28La8t/1/
[19:24:38] <Duce1nik> hello
[19:54:41] <pikaren> so the jQuery source is only 8000+ lines long!
[20:06:55] <spudzee> I need some help with debugging a little function I made
[20:07:11] <rpag> pikaren, is that compressed?
[20:07:35] <rpag> erh i mean, how many chars is it compressed?
[20:08:50] <spudzee> this is my code: http://pastebin.com/Qr8CLaaV
[20:09:00] <spudzee> I can't figure out why it doesn't work
[20:09:21] <spudzee> obviously this isn't all the code, but it's the bit that isn't working
[20:09:35] <pikaren> rpag: it doesnt seem to be compressed
[20:12:05] <spudzee> I'm pretty sure it has a simple fix
[20:12:43] <spudzee> ...guys?
[20:14:53] <spudzee> I really don't understand these chatrooms. There are a crap ton of people here, but no one viewing the actual chat.
[20:15:59] <Robdgreat> people are doing other things. let me have a look
[20:16:15] <spudzee> oh, thank you
[20:17:27] <Robdgreat> most people don't just get on irc, chat in one channel, then log off. Lots of people stay connected around the clock and are living their lives
[20:17:43] <Robdgreat> and lots of those are in a multitude of channels
[20:18:03] <spudzee> When I said I don't understand these chatrooms, I meant that literally. I'm quite new to these
[20:18:08] <Robdgreat> ohhh
[20:21:59] <Robdgreat> spudzee: ever use jsfiddle?
[20:22:17] <spudzee> is that an import?
[20:22:35] <Robdgreat> no, it's a website. http://jsfiddle.net
[20:22:50] <Robdgreat> like an interactive pastebin that actually runs js code
[20:23:16] <spudzee> oh, but did you check my code?
[20:23:44] <Robdgreat> I am now. on the surface it looks fine
[20:23:55] <Robdgreat> I've never used animate very much
[20:27:25] <Robdgreat> ohh
[20:27:33] <Robdgreat> take the var off of the tops = topn
[20:28:08] <Robdgreat> you're redeclaring it in function scope so it goes away after the function exits
[20:28:09] <spudzee> it works!
[20:28:24] <spudzee> thank you
[20:28:26] <Robdgreat> \o/
[20:28:27] <Robdgreat> welcome
[20:28:38] <spudzee> \o/
[23:02:06] <ThKo> Hi everyone, short question: Why is it not possible to use the variables in line 16 to 18 in the function 22 to 35? Thanks a lot! :-)  http://jsfiddle.net/mbdtorgc/1/
[23:35:42] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[23:39:57] <Uhkis> morning
[23:57:13] <Unopoo> when a form submitting, how to check if certain select box has a selection value?
[23:58:34] <Cork> Unopoo: if($('#certain-select').val() == '') { event.preventDefault() }
