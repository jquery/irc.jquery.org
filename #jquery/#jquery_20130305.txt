[00:04:03] <limpc> im getting an error when loading video via flowplayer, saying "no video with supported format and MIME type found"
[00:04:22] <limpc> which i dont get.. the video loads and plays in the browser just fine if i load it directly via url
[00:04:31] <Cork> limpc: what is the mimetype of the video?
[00:04:37] <limpc> video/mp4
[00:04:44] <Cork> what browser?
[00:05:04] <limpc> firefox 18.0.2
[00:05:30] <Cork> <video> doesn't support mp4 in firefox before 19
[00:05:38] <limpc> bleh
[00:06:09] <Cork> AND 18 is eol so you should update anyway :)
[00:07:29] <raj> Cork, my first plugin, or my second maybe... what do you think? http://jsfiddle.net/9V2h5/
[00:07:41] <raj> what can I fix/improve?
[00:08:08] <Cork> would prob call it "hasOverflow" instead
[00:08:15] <raj> k
[00:08:19] <Cork> to follow jquery naming convention
[00:08:22] <raj> any way to make it more expansive?
[00:08:32] <Cork> expansive?
[00:08:41] <raj> like, to be able to be used in more ways
[00:08:44] <raj> more useful
[00:08:57] <raj> less constrained to this very case I need it for
[00:09:35] <Cork> not really, it does what its name says so...
[00:09:52] <raj> $conatiner = this.first() is fine, right?
[00:09:57] <Cork> i would prob have written it in less code though
[00:09:58] <raj> no need to have multiple items
[00:10:13] <Cork> you can't really have multiple items for a true/false return
[00:10:14] <raj> ah ok, how would your code look?
[00:10:48] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/9V2h5/1/
[00:11:12] <leb> can anyone explain why with jquery.knob I can set properties like fgColor from js and html but not CSS?
[00:11:19] <raj> lmao
[00:11:21] <raj> nice :)
[00:11:41] <Cork> i might/might not have used the scrollHeight and the like variables
[00:11:56] <Cork> depends on how readable you could make the check formula while using the values directly
[00:12:09] <Cork> and that might have removed 4 more lines :)
[00:12:24] <Cork> also .first() isn't needed
[00:12:38] <raj> you mean to use $container.prop('scrollHeight') directly?
[00:12:40] <Cork> .prop, .height(), .width already does this by default
[00:13:26] <raj> setters iterate over all items in the selected array, and getters use the first item, is it?
[00:13:38] <Cork> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/9V2h5/2/
[00:14:18] <relipse> is there a way to change WHERE the validate message shows up in the jquery validate plugin?
[00:14:21] <Cork> opps http://jsfiddle.net/9V2h5/3/
[00:14:42] <raj> Cork, was I correct about the getters/setters?
[00:14:57] <Cork> raj: not always no
[00:15:09] <Cork> raj: you would have to check the docs
[00:15:49] <raj> oh ok
[00:16:10] <Cork> but most of the time that statement is correct
[00:16:15] <raj> k, gotcha
[00:16:22] <raj> the return line is > 80 characters
[00:16:35] <raj> faux pas?
[00:16:41] <Cork> sorry?
[00:17:00] <raj> isn't there an 80 character line goal?
[00:17:24] <Cork> some projects have yes
[00:17:37] <Cork> so line breaks the parentheses
[00:17:49] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/9V2h5/4/
[00:18:07] <raj> pretty :)
[00:18:11] <leb> can anyone explain why with jquery.knob I can set properties like fgColor from js and html but not CSS?
[00:18:20] <raj> so || should belong on the previous line
[00:18:27] <raj> i've always put it on the next line during line breaks
[00:18:41] <Cork> raj: again that depends on the project, but ya normally you align the values
[00:18:56] <raj> well, i still align the values
[00:19:01] <raj> just have the || under the return
[00:19:56] <raj> but yes, that looks uglier
[00:19:57] <raj> lol
[00:20:18] <raj> I also usually have two space tabs
[00:20:21] <raj> instead of 4
[00:21:43] <limpc> Cork: ok i upgraded to firefox 19.0
[00:21:48] <limpc> however im still getting the same error
[00:21:55] <Cork> limpc: what os?
[00:21:58] <limpc> linux
[00:22:01] <Cork> ah
[00:22:12] <Cork> you don't have windows media framework there :)
[00:22:25] <Cork> gstreamer is comming but its a bit in the future
[00:22:34] <Cork> might be like ff23 or similar
[00:22:43] <limpc> i have vlc and totem
[00:22:48] <limpc> i also have restricted codecs installed.
[00:22:54] <Cork> you can fallback to <embed> if you like
[00:23:05] <Cork> but <video> can't do it
[00:23:33] <Cork> (unless you compile firefox your self and enabling the experimental gsteamer ;) )
[00:27:07] <Multiply> I'm currently using a rather new version of jQuery, but outdated version of jQuery UI. In this particular case, I'm using UI's .tabs(). They used to work, but now they simply make the ajax call, and skips updating the DOM. No errors. No nothing. I could update to the latest UI, but it will break other parts of the website, so it'll be later. Any quick fix?
[00:27:34] <leb> can anyone explain why with jquery.knob I can set properties like fgColor from js and html but not CSS?
[00:31:56] <BackEndCoder> Hello, I have been looking at the date picker from the ui
[00:32:12] <BackEndCoder> I don't know how to extract the date selected by the end user
[00:32:27] <BackEndCoder> So i can use it to open another url in a div including the date in the url
[00:32:37] <BackEndCoder> (the date the end user selects)
[00:32:50] <BackEndCoder> is there any better examples ?
[00:35:30] <raj> Cork, that'll only work once I put it in the DOM, of course, yes?
[00:35:48] <raj> if the container is in the DOM, I mean
[00:37:36] <Cork> raj: it needs to go a reflow calculation yes
[00:37:50] <Cork> *to go through a
[00:37:58] <Olive6767> Hi there :-)
[00:38:46] <raj> k
[00:39:16] <Olive6767> I have this css property: ::-moz-selection{background:red} that I would like to change using jquery. However $('::-moz-selection').css('background','black'); do not seem to work. Any idea?
[00:39:51] <Cork> Olive6767: ::-moz-selector isn't a dom element
[00:40:01] <Cork> you can't change it through a jquery selector
[00:40:35] <Olive6767> Cork: alright, though is there any javascript way to change it then?
[00:41:01] <Cork> its a psudo element selector, and you would have to locale the rule in the document.styleSheets list
[00:41:10] <Cork> ?mdc document.styleSheets
[00:41:13] <bot-t> Cork, document.styleSheets - Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - Returns a list of stylesheet objects for stylesheets explicitly linked into or embedded in a document. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/document.styleSheets
[00:43:31] <Olive6767> Cork: would i then be able to change the property using something like document_stylesheet->::-moz-selection?
[00:43:53] <seutje> document.styleSheets is so messy :x
[00:43:57] <Cork> no, you would have to loop through the list of rules and then modify it when you find the name
[00:44:16] <Olive6767> prety messy indeed
[00:44:31] <Olive6767> then here is my prob, maybe there is another way around:
[00:44:47] <seutje> I sometimes use this lil ugly script to pipe pseudo-pseudos into ie7
[00:45:04] <seutje> it's gross and doesn't perform very well
[00:45:08] <raj> how can I split a string at the last occurrence of a character
[00:45:10] <raj> ?
[00:45:20] <fn> why do you support ie7?
[00:45:59] <Cork> raj: lastIndexOf and substring
[00:46:11] <seutje> cause I'm told by the people who provide me with the funds I need to feed myself
[00:46:19] <Cork> lol
[00:46:28] <raj> ahh, thank you
[00:46:32] <Olive6767> basicaly, i'm using some '>' and '<' chars ass button to move thru a slideshow, the prob is that when the user clicks fast enough on these buttons, they get selected as double click consequence, and the background color consequently change, which is not eye appealing
[00:47:02] <seutje> and I don't wanna redo my entire stylesheet and replace all pseudos with countless wrappers, just for the 4% or w/e
[00:47:08] <seutje> they can take the perf hit them
[00:47:09] <seutje> then*
[00:47:49] <Cork> Olive6767: why don't you just set user-select: none; ?
[00:48:02] <Cork> ?mdc user-select
[00:48:04] <bot-t> Cork, user-select - CSS | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/user-select
[00:48:26] <Olive6767> Cork: that defiitely sounds like it is what I need, having a try
[00:48:30] <seutje> css, one prop to screw you over, one prop to fix it
[00:48:38] <Cork> lol
[00:52:23] <Olive6767> working like a charm :-) Thx Cork :)
[00:52:47] <ShamanIotasTook> anyone can explain what the asterisk means in: $('input[name*="value"]')
[00:52:55] <ShamanIotasTook> does this mean begins with?
[00:53:12] <ShamanIotasTook> or that is checking that the name of the property is 'value'
[01:11:53] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: it means exists anywhere in
[01:12:37] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[01:13:28] <Ortund> I'm trying to execute my jquery ONLY on IE browsers because HTML5 will handle the stuff on DOM compliant clients... Unfortunately, the jquery doesn't seem to be working in that if (navigator.userAgent.match(/msie/i)) seems to be returning false on IE
[01:13:54] <Cork> Ortund: why not just use a conditional comment?
[01:14:18] <Ortund> Cork, I assume you don't mean <!--[if IE]>
[01:14:31] <Cork> yes i mean conditional comments
[01:14:46] <Cork> that is conditional comments ^
[01:15:23] <Ortund> so... <!--[if IE><script type="text/javascript">// do whatever </script> <[endif]-->
[01:15:34] <Ortund> hectic man... didn't think that would work
[01:15:41] <arghlex> You could also try Modernizr. I believe that has that functionality.
[01:15:48] <Ortund> I normally only use that for loading a different stylesheet
[01:16:15] <Cork> Ortund: also you should use feature detection as far as possible, useragent sniffing is very error prone
[01:16:55] <Cork> only reason i can think of to use ua detection is for graphical rendering bugs
[01:18:56] <Ortund> Cork, I was looking into it, but I just couldn't find anything that made sense to me that day... It was pretty crazy with deadlines
[01:19:14] <Cork> Ortund: so fix it now then :)
[01:19:14] <Ortund> today's not looking fabulous for spending much time on any one thing either
[01:20:03] <Cork> Ortund: feature detection isn't harder then ua sniffing
[01:20:14] <raj> Cork, I have padding on the container
[01:20:16] <Cork> as soon as you get the hang on how to do it that is
[01:20:23] <raj> and that makes it always have overflow
[01:20:24] <Cork> raj: fun
[01:20:31] <raj> not sure why
[01:21:17] <Cork> raj: try innerWidth() instead of width
[01:22:03] <Cork> (same for height)
[01:22:21] <raj> k
[01:22:40] <raj> but doesn't the padding push it down?
[01:22:49] <raj> so it should be taken into account?
[01:22:57] <Ortund> thanks Cork :)
[01:23:06] <Cork> ?.innerWidth @ raj
[01:23:06] <bot-t> raj, .innerWidth(): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding but not border. http://api.jquery.com/innerWidth/
[01:23:08] <Cork> Ortund: np
[01:24:39] <raj> aah, I see
[01:24:44] <raj> thank you
[01:27:33] <raj> Cork, looks like that did the trick :)
[01:27:34] <raj> thank you
[01:27:42] <Cork> heh np
[01:29:23] <Ortund> is IE the only non-DOM-compliant browser in use at the moment>
[01:29:24] <Ortund> ]?
[01:29:32] <Ortund> ????
[01:31:21] <E_mE> can i get the resolved value from a deferred in the promise object?
[01:31:26] <Cork> Ortund: waht do you mean?
[01:31:42] <E_mE> as opposed to using .done(callback);
[01:32:06] <Cork> E_mE: most of the time no, as when you try to access the promise object its most of the time not resolved
[01:32:37] <E_mE> Cork: how can i use deferred to get a return value, similar to how Q does it
[01:32:43] <Ortund> Cork, just something I read while looking up feature detection... said IE wasn't DOM compliant
[01:32:48] <Cork> promise is meant to be used for async callbacks, so that means your code ends before the resolve happens
[01:32:58] <E_mE> Cork: aye
[01:33:04] <Cork> E_mE: through the done register function
[01:33:09] <raj> ok, so the container looks like this-->  `<div class='container'><img/><p></p></div>`. Problem is, the images don't seem to load until the very end of the page load. So calculating overflow is meaningless
[01:33:13] <Cork> anything else would be racy
[01:33:20] <E_mE> Cork: thank you
[01:33:28] <raj> even though the src of the image is local
[01:33:48] <Cork> raj: should work if you want for onload
[01:34:00] <Cork> it should only be triggered when all images are loaded
[01:34:12] <Cork> want==wait
[01:34:21] <raj> $(function() { })?
[01:34:34] <Cork> $(document).on('load'; function() {});
[01:34:51] <raj> the page is loaded using ajax
[01:34:55] <Cork> but you most likely only want to do it for that specifical part
[01:34:59] <Cork> ah
[01:35:16] <Cork> then you would have to catch the img elements and listen for the onload events
[01:35:17] <E_mE> Cork: can you hook on multiple .done() methods and they will be executed in order of declaration?
[01:35:31] <Cork> E_mE: yes, or reverse not sure
[01:35:34] <Cork> but all will be called
[01:35:37] <E_mE> thank you
[01:36:17] <raj> i'm not sure what you mean
[01:36:48] <Cork> raj: parse the html response, then search for img elements in the dom fragment
[01:36:56] <Cork> then add a load event on each element
[01:37:04] <Cork> and then when all have fired do the calculation
[01:37:09] <raj> hmm
[01:37:12] <raj> seems messy
[01:37:22] <Cork> ya, it is, but its the only way
[01:37:41] <Cork> unless you know the dimentions for the images that is
[01:37:57] <raj> i don't, they're thumbnails of photos
[01:38:23] <raj> i'm trying to add ... to the descriptions under
[01:38:30] <raj> so that's why i'm testing for overflow
[01:38:38] <raj> if they're too long, the ... would be added
[01:39:44] <Cork> raj: var count = 0, $html = $(data); count = $html.find('img').length; $html.find('img').on('load', function() { count--; if(count < 0) { /* do your thing */ } }); $target.html($html);
[01:40:01] <Cork> opps
[01:40:05] <Cork> raj: var count = 0, $html = $(data); count = $html.find('img').length; $html.find('img').on('load', function() { count--; if(count <= 0) { /* do your thing */ } }); $target.html($html);
[01:41:29] <raj> this sucks
[01:41:41] <raj> cuz the ajax page load is in a totally different file and everything
[01:42:12] <Cork> so just deferred
[01:42:22] <raj> actually, it's not that
[01:42:34] <Cork> just return the jqXHR object and you can do it in the correct place
[01:42:46] <raj> i have ajax coming in with `data` from the server
[01:42:56] <raj> i'm building the DOM from that
[01:43:11] <Cork> don'
[01:43:12] <raj> although the whole page itself is ajax loaded
[01:43:16] <Cork> don't see how that matters
[01:44:33] <raj> meaning, data looks like--> [{'id':1, 'src':'/some/long/url.png', 'description':'something here'}, ...]
[01:44:51] <raj> and then I iterate through data
[01:47:33] <arghlex> What is the difference between $('.class1, .class2') and $('.class1', '.class2')?
[01:47:59] <dean[h]> I have a table with many <tr>'s. Some of these <tr's> have a class of "heading". Then there are corresponding tr's after that which don't have that class. But then there is another <tr class="heading"> I need to iterate through all $("tr.heading") and in that loop find all of the next tr's which don't have that class *until* the next one that has tr.heading
[01:48:01] <dean[h]> Any ideas?
[01:48:26] <dean[h]> I should point out, this is a greasemonkey script im making for a crappy enterprise piece of software that we have to use at work. I'm trying to make it less crappy :)
[01:53:13] <Olive6767> I have unordered list containing images, and I would like to associate these image a click event using $('#gals li img').click(function(){}); how can I retreive the img index inside the function?
[01:57:47] <Koopz> http://jsfiddle.net/fKPRH/1/ whuzzat?
[01:58:06] <s3b`> hey what is it called when I want to add my own function to an existing class, say "$DOM.setEdit();" instead of "setEdit($DOM);"
[01:58:35] <Clex> Olive6767: With this maybe.
[02:00:28] <Koopz> soo... does anybody know why my checkbox doesn't check after clicking the first button again? http://jsfiddle.net/fKPRH/1/
[02:00:55] <s3b`> Koopz: looking at it h/o
[02:01:01] <Ortund> hmmm Cork, with my conditional statements around the <script> block, it still isn't running the jquery
[02:01:32] <Cork> ?p @ Ortund
[02:01:33] <bot-t> Ortund, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:01:55] <BadCodSmell> Why is it that .data has never worked and I always have to element.attr('data-'+name, JSON.stringify(data)); instead?
[02:02:09] <Aamir> Koopz: http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/fKPRH/2/
[02:02:13] <Cork> dean[h]: the first will work, the second will try to use '.class2' as an object and fail
[02:02:43] <Ortund> not to worry, I think I found the issue
[02:02:43] <Aamir> Koopz: or http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/fKPRH/3/
[02:02:53] <Aamir> use prop instead of attr
[02:02:58] <Ortund> or not...
[02:02:59] <Cork> Olive6767: store the elements in an array and use .index()
[02:03:05] <Cork> (array == jquery in this case)
[02:03:26] <Aamir> Koopz: if you use jQuery 1.8, than attr works http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/fKPRH/4/
[02:03:55] <Cork> BadCodSmell: .data doesn't set values on the element, it stores it in jquery
[02:04:19] <Cork> Aamir: attr is the wong thing
[02:04:33] <Cork> it doesn't work in all browsers, and false doesn't work with attr
[02:04:33] <BadCodSmell> Cork: So jquery has a bugged lookup?
[02:04:40] <Ortund> How can I be sure my $("form").submit(function() { }); is being executed before the for data is sent to the handler?
[02:04:45] <Cork> BadCodSmell: no, its by design
[02:05:07] <Cork> BadCodSmell: .data works with a cache, and only if the value doesn't exist in that cache will it look for an data- attribute
[02:05:07] <Clex> Ortund: if you return false it won't be send.
[02:05:12] <Cork> set never touches the attributes
[02:05:25] <Aamir> Cork: if it works with 1.8, it should work with 1.9 :|
[02:05:30] <Olive6767> Cork: was using $('#gals li img') instead of $('#gals li'), that's why index was always giving me 0, obivous? yes I know....
[02:05:37] <Cork> Aamir: it doens't work as intended since 1.6
[02:05:39] <BadCodSmell> So you are basically saying, in jquery data and elements are not associated
[02:05:46] <Cork> as prop was moved out of attr in 1.6
[02:05:54] <BadCodSmell> except by coincidence of what wrapper they happen to be in
[02:05:55] <Aamir> http://jsfiddle.net/fKPRH/1/  (using attr with jQuery 1.9) -------- http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/fKPRH/3/ (prop with jQuery 1.9) ------ http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/fKPRH/4/ (attr with jquery 1.8)
[02:06:12] <Cork> BadCodSmell: i say that .data isn't meant to be used to set attributes
[02:06:21] <Cork> .attr is for that
[02:06:24] <BadCodSmell> Or associate data with elements
[02:06:34] <Cork> its for associating data
[02:06:38] <BadCodSmell> Wrong
[02:06:42] <sahbeewah> wow busy tonight
[02:06:42] <Cork> not adding them as attributes though
[02:06:45] <BadCodSmell> It's on the wrapper
[02:07:00] <Cork> its stored in an object with the element id as a key
[02:07:09] <BadCodSmell> That means if you set it for an element, then lose the wrapper, get the element again, it's gone, that's not associated with an element.
[02:07:11] <Koopz> Aamir: thanks
[02:07:15] <Cork> so its retrivable through the dom element
[02:07:23] <Cork> BadCodSmell: no
[02:07:24] <BadCodSmell> Then it is obviously bugged
[02:07:31] <Cork> as long as you don't replace the dom element its safe
[02:07:31] <BadCodSmell> Because that does not happen for me
[02:07:36] <Aamir> Koopz: np
[02:07:38] <Cork> then your doing it wrong
[02:08:04] <Cork> Aamir, Koopz: you should NOT use attr for properties
[02:08:20] <Cork> it won't work in all browsers, as not all browsers monitor the dom attributes for changes
[02:08:24] <Ortund> found the problem, my event handlers used to work on $("input[type=submit]").click(function() { }); and targeting $(this).parent("div"); for the form controls - the div is inside the form around the control... dunno why the designer wrote the html like that though
[02:08:32] <Cork> prop sets the property of the dom element, and will give the correct effect
[02:08:34] <Koopz> Cork: alright... gonna keep that in mind
[02:08:36] <Aamir> but I love to use attr :(
[02:08:47] <Cork> Aamir: then you love broken pages
[02:08:57] <Aamir> hahah :P
[02:09:11] <Ortund> problem is I'm now working it on $("form").submit(function() { }); and it's still targeting $(this).parent("div") ... so I assume changing "parent" to "child" should fix
[02:09:12] <Cork> attr('checked', false) and attr('checked', true) will both result in checked == true
[02:09:21] <s3b`> hey what how can i add my own function to an existing element, say "$("td").setEdit();" instead of "setEdit($("td"));"
[02:09:32] <Cork> as what matters is if the attribute exists, not its value
[02:09:43] <Cork> prop on the other hand takes true of false
[02:09:57] <Cork> s34n: extend $.fn
[02:10:17] <s3b`> Cork: alright thanks
[02:10:24] <Cork> opps
[02:10:26] <s3b`> also, you almost got the nick down lol
[02:10:28] <Cork> *s3b`:
[02:10:35] <Cork> ya ^^'
[02:15:45] <clooth> pew pew pew!
[02:16:13] <raj> Cork, http://paste.ofcode.org/39mHniStjQsTeWsXtDdKpTk
[02:16:20] <raj> how can I do this better?
[02:16:29] <raj> or to allow for img loading so I can calculate overflow?
[02:16:42] <BadCodSmell> Cork is .data works can you explain why I have to use both.data and attr?
[02:16:43] <Ortund> Cork, if you're interested in seeing what I'm working on here, go have a look at http://www.just-gym.co.za/withjquery
[02:17:15] <Cork> BadCodSmell: if you want to be able to select based on the value through attribute selectors, you will have to use .attr
[02:17:24] <Cork> BadCodSmell: in all other cases .data will work just fine
[02:17:31] <BadCodSmell> I am doing zero selection on data attributes
[02:17:39] <Cork> then .data should work just fine
[02:17:53] <BadCodSmell> I'm just using them to associate arbitrary data with elements in the dom, once they have been selected traditionally
[02:17:55] <Cork> if it doens't build a demo
[02:19:08] <Cork> raj: you're doing syncronus checking if its loaded, that won't work
[02:19:22] <Cork> you will have to listen for it an use the load event
[02:19:42] <raj> i'm not doing any checking yet
[02:19:55] <Cork> $single_thumb.hasOverflow() ?
[02:20:11] <raj> oh
[02:20:13] <raj> i see
[02:20:13] <BadCodSmell> Cork: Will wraping $(this) in an event cause jquery to fail to find the association?
[02:20:32] <raj> so where would the load event checking fit into that?
[02:20:36] <Cork> not as long as this are still the dom element
[02:20:57] <ShamanIotasTook> $("#myprogressbar").progressbar({max:shaman._preferences.maxSize}); isn't working??
[02:21:08] <Cork> raj: you would have to break out the <img> sections and add event listeners to them
[02:21:10] <ShamanIotasTook> it works when i initialize, but not resetting
[02:21:32] <Cork> raj: you would also have to make your loop async instead of syncronus
[02:21:41] <raj> how's that done?
[02:21:51] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: you mean update an existing one?
[02:21:51] <raj> ...making async instead
[02:21:58] <ShamanIotasTook> correct, cork
[02:22:04] <Cork> raj: have a function and call it from the callback for example
[02:22:12] <Cork> raj: like i did the scroll example before
[02:22:18] <ShamanIotasTook> user resets preferences, i need to reset max size so they know how much to buffer is left
[02:22:34] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: $("#myprogressbar").progressbar('option', 'max', shaman._preferences.maxSize);
[02:22:50] <ShamanIotasTook> what a lifesaver!
[02:24:11] <s3b`> Yay time to play the I don't know what I'm doing game
[02:24:12] <s3b`> http://jsfiddle.net/fKPRH/1/
[02:24:16] <s3b`> $.fn.extend
[02:24:18] <Cork> lol
[02:25:29] <s3b`> oh wrong link
[02:25:31] <s3b`> shit balls
[02:27:22] <s3b`> Okay, here: http://jsfiddle.net/fKPRH/5/
[02:28:55] <s3b`> other than the typo in the call, fixed it still says "has no method helloWorld()"
[02:29:02] <Cork> s3b`: this is normally how you do it http://jsfiddle.net/fKPRH/6/
[02:29:31] <Cork> is kinda pointless to return the value from helloWorld
[02:29:48] <Cork> as then it wouldn't have much meaning to attach it to a selection
[02:29:56] <s3b`> haha yeah long day lots of jquery, i was just trying to get the call working
[02:30:08] <s3b`> thats helpful
[02:30:44] <Cork> s34n: for a return example http://jsfiddle.net/fKPRH/7/
[02:31:01] <Cork> kinda pointless but :)
[02:32:35] <s3b`> s34n again hahahaha.
[02:32:40] <s3b`> YES it works in my practical app
[02:32:41] <s3b`> ty ty
[02:32:52] <s3b`> (y)
[02:33:17] <Cork> this isn't an msn chat >_>
[02:33:29] <Cork> ( y ) doesn't man much to me
[02:33:40] <raj> Cork, tbh, I have no idea
[02:33:58] <s3b`> haha. i think you're the first person to catch what it means
[02:34:05] <s3b`> or at least point it out
[02:34:53] <Cork> i have a vage idea what it means, but my point was that its not in its correct medium
[02:35:05] <Cork> and your better of not using it
[02:35:26] <s3b`> it was just a thumbs up :(
[02:36:08] <s3b`> hey while I'm here, do you guys have a preference for doc'ing jQuery? I'm using yuidoc right now
[02:36:21] <Cork> s3b`: in irc thats *thumb up*
[02:36:55] <Cork> s3b`: can't say i do much automatic docking so nope
[02:37:36] * s3b` slaps Cork around with a large fish
[02:37:43] <s3b`> is that more irc for you
[02:37:47] <BackEndCoder> hello, i am trying to use a datepicker ui thing to select a date value from it and make another div grab json data and return it
[02:37:49] <BackEndCoder> what is this method called ?
[02:37:57] * Cork grabs the fish and cooks it over an open fire
[02:38:06] <BackEndCoder> i don't know jquery at all, i can try and use google, but i don't know what i am trying to search for
[02:38:28] <s3b`> which datepicker ui thing?
[02:38:34] <s3b`> or are you looking for one
[02:38:53] <BackEndCoder> there is a datepicker as part of the jquery ui. its a box with dates in it
[02:39:05] <BackEndCoder> its not the input box version
[02:39:11] <BackEndCoder> its a graphical box with dates in.
[02:39:13] <Cork> BackEndCoder: datepicker is the thing i've used least of all, but have a look at http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[02:39:22] <BackEndCoder> I have seen this page
[02:39:34] <Cork> the examples and the api docs should hopefully help you
[02:39:39] <BackEndCoder> I can't find that part were it talks about extracting click data
[02:39:39] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[02:39:42] <s3b`> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-getDate ?
[02:40:11] <BackEndCoder> I think the page assumes you know the basics
[02:40:32] <s3b`> jquery probably has the best docs, if you ever need to-
[02:40:33] <s3b`> oh
[02:40:38] <Cork> BackEndCoder: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-onSelect
[02:40:52] <s3b`> what do you usually write with BackEndCoder:?
[02:40:57] <Cork> i suspect thats what you want
[02:41:22] <htmelvis> yeah BackEndCoder i think you want onSelect
[02:41:41] <ShamanIotasTook> ok: one last suggestion, and i have everything i need!
[02:41:50] <s3b`> my bad I didn't look at the descriptions to be honest
[02:42:18] <ShamanIotasTook> what i want is an 'alert' type message box that pops up and then fades out, just lays near top of screen...best approach to use div and then show/fade? any suggestions?
[02:42:54] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: ya
[02:42:58] <htmelvis> ShamanIotasTook depending on your level of JS knowledge theres tons of options
[02:43:11] <Cork> ShamanIotasTook: depends on how much functionality you need
[02:43:16] <ShamanIotasTook> i'm looking for something simple, jquery because i like the fade
[02:43:25] <htmelvis> bootstrap has probably the easiest modal setup i've ever seen but you have to extract it out of the framework
[02:43:54] <Cork> if all you need it a overlay and a close button, not need
[02:44:09] <Cork> it can all be done with css, and then just a button to remove it
[02:44:38] <htmelvis> Yeah that's true Cork as long as you are not supporting legacy browsers
[02:44:47] <ShamanIotasTook> actually, what i'd LOVE to do is that i have a 'logo' near the top of my screen that is kinda banner-wise...what would be great is to have it look like a 'box' that 'rotates' from logo to display text (like 3-d transform) and then rotate back to logo after like 3 seconds
[02:44:54] <Cork> htmelvis: it works fine in > ie6
[02:44:58] <Cork> and ya, i cut there
[02:45:06] <htmelvis> wow i'd love to see an example of that
[02:45:10] <ShamanIotasTook> i'd be willing to pay a bounty for that
[02:45:15] <Cork> and in ie6 you can make it work with some extra css rules
[02:45:28] <Cork> (it needs position: absolute instead of position: fixed)
[02:45:33] <htmelvis> hmmm that sounds awesome Cork
[02:45:35] <ShamanIotasTook> i need cross browser for all modern browsers (IE10, not 9)
[02:45:45] <Cork> ie5.5 is simply impossible though
[02:45:49] <htmelvis> oh then you are all set ShamanIotasTook
[02:45:58] <htmelvis> yeah i don't support ie6 anymore
[02:46:01] <htmelvis> 7+ is it
[02:46:03] <Cork> wow no need for ie9 >_>
[02:46:07] <Cork> thats... wow
[02:46:10] <ShamanIotasTook> nope :)
[02:46:17] <alaing> Hi I've got a plugin that uses jquery ui. now my plugin is working for jquery ui < 1.10  but because 1.10 lost suppost for 'select' event and replaced with 'active' I need to try and make it work with both old/new version
[02:46:23] <Cork> that means no support for winxp and vista...
[02:46:36] <ShamanIotasTook> well, one way or another, if it takes me all week, i need to figure that rotating thingy
[02:46:37] <FinalAngel> heya, can anyone recommend a good javascript charts library (open-source and free) that's easy styleable and integratable (extendable a plus)?
[02:46:40] <ShamanIotasTook> guess i better get to work
[02:47:01] <ShamanIotasTook> i was just hoping someone had seen something like that
[02:47:02] <BackEndCoder> i pulled out my net cable as i was typing, would anyone beable to tell me the last thing i said ?
[02:47:21] <htmelvis> FinalAngel all the good ones i've used are paid. Not sure there is a good one that is open source
[02:47:26] <alaing> in my <1.10 version i have .bind('tabselect',function....) i ried replacing the tabselect with active and beforeactive but the code in the callback is not being called
[02:47:27] <Cork> BackEndCoder> I think the page assumes you know the basics
[02:47:38] <BackEndCoder> thanks
[02:47:44] <FinalAngel> htmelvis: yeah I know, otherwise I'd use highcharts & co
[02:47:52] <BackEndCoder> From what i can see at getDate() something i have seen before, is its how to produce the datepicker on a certain date
[02:47:53] <htmelvis> Right
[02:47:59] <BackEndCoder> what i am looking for, is how to take the value of the date that has been pressed by the end user
[02:48:08] <BackEndCoder> to use this value in doing other things
[02:48:16] <htmelvis> I ended my search for them just by saying "Screw it, I'll just pay" FinalAngel
[02:48:21] <FinalAngel> htmelvis: have you had a look at ChartFX?
[02:48:21] <Cork> BackEndCoder: <Cork> BackEndCoder: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-onSelect
[02:48:29] <htmelvis> no not at all FinalAngel
[02:48:36] <Cork> BackEndCoder: the answer came after you pulled your cable :)
[02:48:49] <BackEndCoder> So i need a way of knowing what date has been clicked by the end user... so how put this into a call to another page
[02:48:49] <BackEndCoder> thank you so much
[02:48:52] <BackEndCoder> I will do some reading
[02:48:54] <FinalAngel> htmelvis: seems like the only option atm but dunno if it's usable for interactive charts
[02:49:07] <htmelvis> That looks super serious FinalAngel
[02:49:26] <Cork> BackEndCoder: check the different on* options, you can get for other situations too
[02:49:38] <htmelvis> FinalAngel well, they do have a trial period
[02:49:42] <alaing> any idea why the datepicker would not display in FF. It displays in IE and when I inspect the DOM using Firebug my input element has a 'hasDatepicker' class name
[02:49:54] <htmelvis> I'm no .NET guy so I wouldn't know where to start
[02:50:13] <Cork> FinalAngel: personally i like raphael and g.raphael
[02:50:39] <htmelvis> FinalAngel did you see they have jChartFX? HTML5 version of chartFX
[02:50:40] <Cork> mainly cause it keeps it as svg/vml so you can dom manipulate it
[02:51:13] <htmelvis> Free set of what we are looking at
[02:59:14] <gener1c> i loading jquery mobile using a condition only under a certain resolution , is that redundant?
[03:00:25] <Cork> you will save the bandwidth for the lib, but most likely you would save the same by bundling them
[03:00:33] <quazimodo> anyone with ckeditor experience here?
[03:00:42] <Cork> ?ask @ quazimodo

[03:02:06] <quazimodo> I am not able to set my default ckeditor toolbar, no matter what I do. I'm replacing textareas using class="ckeditor"
[03:02:54] <Cork> and you've set the config for ckeditor?
[03:03:05] <Cork> it has a config object it uses
[03:03:32] <quazimodo> https://gist.github.com/quazimodo/2a5dd2b564faa7bf7e9d
[03:03:42] <Cork> either in the package if your using it raw, or most likely in a config in your cms if your using that
[03:04:25] <Cork> hmm, i could have sworn it used named toolbars and you switched that with a pref
[03:04:43] <quazimodo> >.<
[03:05:53] <Cork> ah
[03:05:56] <Cork> no its an override

[03:09:28] <alaing> Hi guys anyidea how I can make this bit of code compatible with jquery ui 1.10 and below. http://pastebin.com/jLraUfuQ
[03:09:39] <Cork> yay for anti spam rkills ^^
[03:09:45] <alaing> I know the select event has been removed
[03:10:02] <alaing> and the ui.panels have changes in 1.10
[03:10:31] <quazimodo> :*( my config is being ignored :(
[03:11:04] <seutje> oh boy, this library loads in additional js files, but it seems to do it based on it's own path, so getscript isn't rly working very well
[03:11:33] <seutje> any better way to have a callback when it loads besides using a lil perpetual setTimeout to check a global object defined in said js file?
[03:11:40] <Cork> alaing: should be possible my just binding the same event type that are in event
[03:11:51] <Cork> *possible by
[03:11:56] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#option-event
[03:12:22] <ShamanIotasTook> i got it mostly working and it's SOOOOO COOL!
[03:13:37] <alaing> Cork: $element.tabs(uiw.options.tabOptions) // is just to set it to the last "remembered" tab
[03:13:49] <alaing> and the .bind I think needs to be changed
[03:13:57] <quazimodo> Cork: hrm can you see why this wouldn't work?
[03:14:04] <alaing> pre 1.10 i used tabselected
[03:14:06] <Cork> seutje: thats a tough one, if you can grab the script element as its added you can use that to listen for onload
[03:14:31] <Cork> seutje: not sure there isn't really a way to do it unless you have access to the request origin
[03:14:59] <Cork> alaing: if i understand it correctly 1.10 uses http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#option-event
[03:15:06] <Cork> and you should be able to make that work i think
[03:15:36] <Cork> quazimodo: you might be loading the config to late, other then that; no
[03:16:03] <quazimodo> https://gist.github.com/quazimodo/2a5dd2b564faa7bf7e9d
[03:16:15] <quazimodo> that's the whole file
[03:16:19] <Kneta> Can someone explain for me what this means: (function () { ... lots of code ... })(); Is that code executed directly after it has been read in? ( may be a more general javascript question than a specific JQuery)
[03:16:30] <Cork> quazimodo: ya, but where are you loading the file?
[03:16:37] <Cork> s/file/resource/
[03:17:13] <quazimodo> well after the ckeditor stuff
[03:17:13] <Cork> Kneta: its called a self executing anonymous function, also known as a scope
[03:17:42] <Kneta> Cork: ok thanks! I'll google that
[03:17:48] <quazimodo> https://gist.github.com/quazimodo/2a5dd2b564faa7bf7e9d
[03:20:08] <quazimodo> hrm well that function's not being called
[03:22:13] <softmanpetro> I try to use a delay function from inside a $('.quantity').bind("keyup", function (event){...delay(function(url) {...my code need to run after delay of 1 sec
[03:22:50] <softmanpetro> problem is that in my code before delay I used $(this).parents... and now I loos it
[03:23:02] <softmanpetro> how to pass it to delay and return it after tha time ?
[03:23:12] <softmanpetro> I used http://snipplr.com/view/49765/keyup-callback-delay/
[03:24:00] <BackEndCoder>  with jsfiddle, is it possible to put js in the html part, to render ui components
[03:24:07] <BackEndCoder> and then use the js part to play with that data ?
[03:24:37] <zlomerovic> motka here, with a new name
[03:24:49] <zlomerovic> I want to ask can I post my jquery plugin code here for review ?
[03:25:16] <superdo> jqmobile ajax navigation can get back json data from server?
[03:25:56] <softmanpetro> I've tried to pass it with var element = $(this); delay(function(element) ...
[03:26:07] <seutje> Cork: figured as much.. perpetual timer seems gross though
[03:26:24] <zlomerovic> hello?
[03:30:04] <ShamanIotasTook> i need to do something like: $(el).toggleClass("flipped").waitsometime().toggleClass("Flipped");
[03:30:27] <ShamanIotasTook> so it toggles, then like 2 seconds later, toggles back
[03:31:24] <quazimodo> Cork: solved it
[03:31:25] <quazimodo> Cork: just needed to set CKEDITOR.config.toolbar = ...
[03:31:47] <quazimodo> didn't even need to get into dealing with CKEDITOR.editorConfig
[03:32:38] <zlomerovic> tired of document.createElement ?
[03:32:38] <zlomerovic> https://github.com/zlomerovic/jquery-create
[03:37:58] <ShamanIotasTook> nvm: did it with a setTimeout :)
[03:42:47] <xec> zlomerovic: how about just doing $("<div>") // You have created a <div></div> inside the DOM memory
[03:43:01] <Cork> zlomerovic: whats wrong with $('<div>') ?
[03:43:09] <Cork> opps :)
[03:43:10] * xec high fives Cork
[03:43:26] * Cork high fives xec
[03:43:47] <pbor> hi, I am using jqueryui tabs to turn a list of <a> in tabs, however some of the hrefs point to xml fragments. What is the best way process the received response before it is added to the content?
[03:44:27] <Cork> zlomerovic: and for a more complex example $('div').create({ 'tabindex': '-1', 'id': 'some_id', 'data-id': '12' })  =>  $('<div>', { 'tabindex': '-1', 'id': 'some_id', 'data-id': '12' })
[03:45:28] <obert> what is that?
[03:45:29] <Cork> pbor: are you using the built in ajax feature in tabs?
[03:45:36] <xec> zlomerovic: also, $("<div>", { css: { width: "100%" } }) etc
[03:45:52] <pbor> Cork: yes
[03:45:57] <Cork> xec: high five again :)
[03:45:57] <obert> tabindex on div?
[03:46:06] <Cork> obert: gives it focusability
[03:46:52] <obert> :P
[03:47:28] <Cork> pbor: you might be able to fix it up in beforeLoad
[03:47:43] <Cork> else you would prob have to do the fetching your self instead of doing it through tabs
[03:48:29] <pbor> Cork: okay, I'll try that and worse case do it manually, thanks

[03:49:44] <angelazou> hi I have a script here http://jsbin.com/agemub/4/edit
[03:50:06] <angelazou> where when I select a lesson, it's corresponding course should be selected
[03:50:38] <angelazou> based on the mapping array object I have declared in the beginning of the script
[03:51:25] <Cork> angelazou: $("#field_95 :selected").val(); should be $("#field_95").val();
[03:51:43] <ShamanIotasTook> got it working, looks sweet!
[03:51:47] <zlomerovic> well I havent new men
[03:51:48] <ShamanIotasTook> like completely working
[03:51:53] <zlomerovic> that I can do what you have wrote
[03:51:55] <angelazou> Cork: but I need to choose the second field based on the selected value of the first dropdown
[03:52:02] <zlomerovic> I am going to delete  the repository now
[03:52:06] <zlomerovic> such a shame
[03:52:27] <Cork> angelazou: my point is $('select').val() will be its select value
[03:52:34] <Cork> the selected value event
[03:52:38] <Cork> *even
[03:53:05] <xec> zlomerovic: for what it's worth, i love that you're sharing your work, and the repository was well documented :)
[03:53:42] <Cork> ya, a note for the future might be to check if it already exist though ;)
[03:54:13] <Cork> also it had the same problem as live did with how you implemented it
[03:54:26] <Cork> as you actually select for $('div') in the page
[03:55:15] <zlomerovic> well I didn't knew that I can just
[03:55:26] <zlomerovic> $('<div>') to create the element in the current DOM instance
[03:55:33] <zlomerovic> I tought everyone's struggling with
[03:55:37] <angelazou> Cork: yeah, I fixed that and another thing, but problem is, the values are call correct
[03:55:39] <zlomerovic> $(document.createElement). etc
[03:55:53] <angelazou> but it wouldn't select the right value
[03:56:00] <xec> yeah but $("div") is still a bad idea, $.create("div") would be better
[03:56:15] <angelazou> for example, the first option hello world in c belongs to hello world
[03:56:17] <Cork> angelazou: $(select2).val(newSelectValue) ?
[03:56:20] <t432> has anyone worked with bower?
[03:56:23] <xec> so you don't first search the dom for divs before ignoring the selection and looking at the selector
[03:56:58] <angelazou> aha, thanks
[03:57:14] <zlomerovic> so I'll do it
[03:57:19] <zlomerovic> nonetheless
[03:57:37] <xec> zlomerovic: sorry, do what?
[03:57:49] <zlomerovic> $.create('div');
[03:58:16] <xec> i don't see the point tbh, the original syntax is shorter and built-in
[03:58:24] <zlomerovic> but you have said
[03:58:38] <zlomerovic>  "$.create("div") would be better" -- xec
[03:58:38] <xec> $("<div>") won't select all divs
[03:58:53] <Cork> zlomerovic: better then $('div').create()
[03:58:58] <xec> yes i was discussing Cork's point
[03:59:04] <Cork> not better then $('<div>')
[03:59:10] <zlomerovic> aha
[03:59:19] <zlomerovic> so that means I can
[03:59:31] <zlomerovic> $( $('<div') ).etc() ?
[03:59:39] <Cork> no need for the extra $()
[03:59:40] <xec> not quite
[03:59:48] <xec> you also need the >
[03:59:56] <zlomerovic> sorry about that, typo
[04:00:00] <zlomerovic> but you know what I've ment
[04:00:01] <xec> $("<div>").etc()
[04:00:11] <zlomerovic> great
[04:00:14] <zlomerovic> I will remove the code
[04:00:15] <zlomerovic> then
[04:00:23] <Cork> zlomerovic: you can also do $('<div><p><a>link</a></p>(so on)</div>')
[04:00:33] <Cork> if you want to just parse a long section of html
[04:00:41] <xec> or even $("<div>", etc: myParametersForTheEtcPlugin )
[04:00:53] <xec> sorry $("<div>", { etc: myParametersForTheEtcPlugin })
[04:00:57] <Cork> that syntax is a bit horrible though
[04:01:33] <xec> hehe i love that you use both "a bit" and "horrible"
[04:01:33] <zlomerovic> I need an idea
[04:01:35] <zlomerovic> for new plugin
[04:01:40] <Cork> heh
[04:01:53] <xec> slighly disgusting
[04:01:59] <xec> +t
[04:02:04] <Cork> wonder if w3c should show this at the top everytime the page don't validate :D
[04:02:05] <Cork> http://dutherenverseauborddelatable.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/marketplace.jpg
[04:02:15] <Cork> XD
[04:02:21] <xec> awww cute foxie <3
[04:03:15] <xec> every time you write invalid html, god kills a firefox puppy
[04:03:24] <Cork> :D
[04:03:37] <Cork> or use single vendor prefixes
[04:03:56] <Hornet> anybody encountered a bug where $(this).parent().remove(); removes the node PRIOR to the actual node?
[04:04:09] <Hornet> don't ask for a url as this is in a private system
[04:04:12] <xec> yeah, every time you use single vendor prefixes, god makes a browser vendor switch to webkit =(
[04:04:31] <Cork> Hornet: uh, ya it should remove everything related to the parent of the current element
[04:04:42] <Cork> xec: heh good one
[04:05:19] <Cork> Hornet: if you get more, make sure your html is valid, as that might move things around in the resulting dom
[04:05:49] <Hornet> in a structure like <div><span></span><strong><a></a></strong></div> console.log($(this).parent()) will log <strong><a></a></strong> , but running $(this).parent().remove() will remove the <span> instead
[04:06:09] <Hornet> the html is fine
[04:06:19] <Cork> Hornet: can you reproduce this in jsfiddle?
[04:06:21] <xec> what is "this" in that context?
[04:06:26] <Hornet> the A
[04:06:40] <Hornet> Cork, no idea
[04:06:45] <Hornet> don't really have time to try
[04:06:59] <Cork> we can't really help you without a working demo
[04:07:12] <Hornet> well you can but you don't want to think, you want to play :)
[04:07:12] <Cork> so it will have to fall on you to either debug it, or provide something that someone can debug
[04:07:17] <Hornet> understandable but annoying
[04:07:37] <Cork> else there is nothing anyone can do for you
[04:07:46] <Cork> the code you showed should work just fine
[04:07:58] <Hornet> I know :\
[04:08:14] <xec> Hornet: should work, http://jsfiddle.net/nrjCc/
[04:08:25] <Cork> as it basically does div.removeChild(this.parentNode)
[04:08:28] <Hornet> I know it should work that's why I'm here asking about a damn bug
[04:08:29] <Hornet> sigh
[04:08:51] <Cork> Hornet: there is obviously a bug, but most likely not in jquery or the browser
[04:08:56] <xec> Hornet: i don't know about a bug. probably something related to your site
[04:09:10] <Cork> as its very simple code we'r talking about
[04:09:46] <Hornet> there's a lot going on here, I can only presume maybe a node index changes as there's an ajax edit before it that inserts some elements into the <strong>
[04:09:49] <Cork> this.parentNode.parentNode.removeChild(this.parentNode) to be exact btw :)
[04:10:10] <Cork> Hornet: dom don't work by indexes
[04:10:15] <Hornet> but the selector that's running, should always only match the div
[04:10:17] <Cork> they work by reference
[04:10:32] <Hornet> well sometimes things are saved by index position internally
[04:10:38] <Cork> a child point to it's parent
[04:10:49] <Cork> and the parent remove a child by resetting the parent link
[04:10:52] <xec> points* its*
[04:11:07] <BackEndCoder> on using onSelect with datepicker, i'm assume it would be called with $(this).datapicker.onSelect() = value ?
[04:11:18] <BackEndCoder> I wish there was a noob example somewhere
[04:11:18] <Cork> BackEndCoder: no
[04:11:34] <Cork> datepicker({ onSelect: function() {} })
[04:11:45] <Hornet> cork: if I run the selector in the console manually everything's fine
[04:11:56] <BackEndCoder> ok... thanks
[04:12:00] <Hornet> something mental is going on
[04:12:09] <BackEndCoder> is there a best practise for using this with jsfiddle ?
[04:12:17] <BackEndCoder> i have been unable to make the datepicker display as yet
[04:12:23] <Hornet> I can't reproduce everything here in fiddle as there's a load of libraries involved
[04:12:39] <Cork> BackEndCoder: you need the css files, thats prob where your stuck right now
[04:12:57] <BackEndCoder> ok, i will add them and see if it helps
[04:13:09] <xec> you're*
[04:13:31] * xec gets on everyones nerves
[04:13:42] <Cork> BackEndCoder: btw you used datApicker in your example before
[04:13:51] <Cork> that might be your problem :)
[04:13:55] <Cork> BackEndCoder: http://jsfiddle.net/LVVsy/
[04:14:24] <angelazou> Cork: thanks
[04:14:27] <Hornet> even running it before the loop causes it to vanish
[04:14:28] <Hornet> sigh
[04:14:28] <Cork> xec: or i am, not sure >_>
[04:14:31] <angelazou> all done and well :)
[04:16:04] <Cork> i love the fact that so many of newbies problems is cause they over-complicate the problems :)
[04:16:39] <Cork> it's always so nice to remove large complex code in order to make it work :)
[04:16:48] <Hornet> who are you referring to?
[04:17:07] <Cork> no one specifically
[04:17:17] <Cork> just in general, its a quite common theme in here ^^
[04:17:29] * xec whistles the jQuery theme song
[04:17:32] <Cork> angelazou was the latest example of that
[04:17:35] <Cork> lol
[04:17:59] <Cork> xec: you're lucky, i've never heard that one
[04:18:07] <Hornet> seems that$(this).closest('td').find('#countries').parent().hide() works properly
[04:18:16] <Hornet> however .remove does not
[04:18:21] <Hornet> so the bug must be with that
[04:18:24] <Cork> O_o
[04:18:29] <Cork> hide doesn't remove
[04:18:33] <Hornet> I know...
[04:18:33] <Cork> it just sets display: none;
[04:18:36] <Hornet> I KNOW
[04:18:39] <Hornet> debugging
[04:18:53] <BackEndCoder> Thanks Cork, you allowed me to work it out from your example : http://jsfiddle.net/skWMS/1/
[04:19:04] <BackEndCoder> now i need to work out how to use onSelect :D
[04:19:15] <Hornet> same reason for the ridiculous up and down selector
[04:19:24] <Hornet> the 'this' is actually #countries already
[04:19:44] <xec> Cork: http://music.thewikies.com/jonneal/yayquery/jquery
[04:19:48] <Cork> BackEndCoder: http://jsfiddle.net/skWMS/2/
[04:20:05] <Cork> LOL
[04:20:28] <xnotte> how can i use this selector later ?    var widget = $(this).parent();       $('widget').hide(); doesnt work, neither  $('#'+widget).hide();
[04:20:56] <Cork> widget.hide()
[04:21:04] <Hornet> widget becomes a jquery instance
[04:21:17] <Hornet> useful trick is to name blessed elements as $widget
[04:21:20] <Hornet> so you know they're instances
[04:21:36] <xec> Cork: actually, this was the one i was thinking of http://music.thewikies.com/jonneal/yayquery/opening-theme
[04:21:40] <Cork> its nice, but it also has a tendency to be pointless
[04:21:48] <Hornet> depends on your code
[04:22:08] <Hornet> on complex sites that can save a lot of headaches
[04:22:08] <xnotte> Hornet: thanks
[04:22:11] <Hornet> np
[04:22:15] * Cork wish that player had a volume control...
[04:22:49] <xec> yeah, to turn it UP right?
[04:22:52] <Hornet> right now the question is how do I use .remove without using .remove
[04:23:10] <Hornet> I suppose [0] oldschool
[04:23:18] <xnotte> Hornet: like var $widget?
[04:23:20] <Cork> [0].parentNode.removeChild()
[04:23:24] <Hornet> yeah
[04:23:45] <Hornet> problem is there are two children, one has to go the other doesn't
[04:24:12] <Cork> Hornet: you remove by REFERENCE
[04:24:14] <Cork> like i said
[04:24:22] <Cork> just give it the element you want to remove
[04:24:48] <Cork> $(this).parent().remove() === this.parentNode.parentNode.removeChild(this.parentNode)
[04:25:00] <BackEndCoder> http://jsfiddle.net/skWMS/3/ <-- something like this but better is required :D
[04:25:29] <Hornet> yus it'd have to be
[04:25:34] <Hornet> god life was a pain pre jquery
[04:25:46] <Hornet> well pre prototype really
[04:25:53] <Hornet> as that started the lot
[04:25:58] <Cork> ugg no prototype was horrible
[04:26:08] <Hornet> at the time it was the best/only option
[04:26:09] <Cork> H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E
[04:26:11] <Hornet> then mootools
[04:26:13] <Hornet> then jquery
[04:26:16] <Cork> lol
[04:26:27] <Cork> i'm ok with most frameworks except prototype
[04:26:32] <BackEndCoder> o, i nearly got it, i sshould have read up, thanks :D
[04:26:40] <Hornet> nowadays it's old and outdated yes
[04:26:44] <yogurt_truck> prototype was horrible?
[04:26:51] <yogurt_truck> `was`?
[04:26:55] <Cork> Hornet: no i meant it was and always has been horrible
[04:26:56] <Hornet> but back in the day it was basically the only real system that was workable
[04:27:18] <Cork> yogurt_truck: well the maintainer of it has moved to jquery so... i talk about it in past-tense
[04:27:26] <Hornet> YUI tried some stuff too, I suppose you could argue that was viable
[04:27:32] <Hornet> but that was a nightmare in its own way
[04:27:46] <Hornet> anyway I digress, no time for a bloody history lesson
[04:27:46] <yogurt_truck> Cork: :)
[04:27:48] <Cork> what made prototype horrible is that it has not error handling at all
[04:28:00] <Cork> as soon as something didn't work exactly right it crashed
[04:28:21] <Cork> so you had to alway add millions of try catches in the code >_<
[04:28:24] <Cork> or if cases
[04:30:50] <Hornet> 				var raw = $(this)[0];
[04:30:51] <Hornet> 				raw.parentNode.parentNode.removeChild(raw.parentNode);
[04:30:56] <Hornet> that works perfectly
[04:31:03] <Hornet> so bug must be within .remove somewhere
[04:31:23] <xec> you don't need to put it in a var, just use `this`
[04:31:24] <Hornet> jquery version is 1.7.2
[04:32:04] <antique> when jQuery initialize, it set a context document and window; later we can change context like this $(selector, context);  Any way to create local copy of jQuery with my context document?
[04:32:10] <xec> this === $(this)[0]
[04:32:30] <Hornet> xec that's a simplicifation, but yes I know what you're saying
[04:33:02] <Cork> ?.sub @ antique
[04:33:02] <bot-t> antique, jQuery.sub(): Creates a new copy of jQuery whose properties and methods can be modified without affecting the original jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.sub/
[04:33:38] <Cork> Hornet: and as what you've said as been proven that it works, your looking at the wrong place
[04:33:56] <xec> you're*
[04:34:07] <xec> :D
[04:34:08] <Cork> locate what makes it break, and then start from there
[04:34:17] <Hornet> I have, the .remove call :P
[04:34:20] <Cork> don't stare blindly at remove and thing that will fix it
[04:34:23] <Hornet> I've simplified it as much as I can
[04:34:33] <Hornet> replacing that has fixed it
[04:34:35] <Cork> Hornet: so does http://jsfiddle.net/nrjCc/1/
[04:34:38] <Cork> and it works just fine
[04:34:41] <Hornet> good for it
[04:34:43] <Cork> so your problem is somewhere else
[04:35:01] <Hornet> such as?
[04:35:08] <Hornet> this is a simple bit of code here
[04:35:12] <Cork> how would we be able to say?
[04:35:16] <Cork> you don't show us any code
[04:35:22] <Hornet> unless something is moving what 'this' refers to and putting it back when I debug it...
[04:35:29] <Cork> all we can say your description isn't enough to see a bug
[04:35:31] <Hornet> I can but without a fuckton of libs it won't work
[04:35:32] <Cork> so WFM
[04:35:43] <xec> wfm?
[04:35:49] <Cork> Works For Me
[04:36:15] <Cork> ex you might be using the parent reference later and that makes it break or who knows
[04:36:33] <Cork> all we know is that your description isn't enough so your missing what makes things break
[04:37:15] <Hornet> http://pastebin.com/WTmG4wdZ cork
[04:37:20] <Cork> and just blaming remove() and work around that most likely will just work until something else makes a small shift and then something else breaks
[04:37:40] <Cork> uh... a working example...
[04:37:44] <Hornet> like I said
[04:37:55] <Hornet> that's the code there
[04:38:13] <Cork> but its not complete enough to be runnable
[04:38:19] <Cork> so its pointless >_<
[04:38:25] <Hornet> like I said.
[04:38:34] <Cork> man have you ever done a bug report or regression search! >_>
[04:39:03] <Cork> reproducing the problem is point 1, if you don't manage that you have nothing
[04:39:28] <Cork> and that means reproducing it in a small working case
[04:39:43] <xec> you go Cork
[04:40:19] <Hornet> I don't have time to strip everything back to try to work out what the issue is
[04:40:25] <seutje> ugh, don't u just love documentation that mentions a options-object, but doesn't have a reference to what it could contain?
[04:41:03] <Cork> seutje: lol ya, been there
[04:41:10] <seutje> any happen to have any experience with fusioncharts?
[04:41:14] <Cork> seutje: though looking at the source is normally a good way to find it
[04:41:16] <seutje> any1, even
[04:41:23] <seutje> this is like 160KB
[04:41:37] <Cork> seutje: just search for the option variables name
[04:41:38] <seutje> no wait... 260 in total
[04:41:47] <Cork> normally they have a default value specified
[04:41:55] <Cork> and you can find all the options there
[04:41:59] <Cork> (normally)
[04:42:31] <antique> mm nom, .sub() cant help
[04:42:47] <Cork> antique: what is it your trying to do?
[04:42:54] <xec> you're*
[04:43:04] <seutje> also, this is proprietary, so it's all minified and stuff :(
[04:43:06] <Cork> opps thats like the third time today >_<
[04:43:08] <Hornet> see PM Cork, URL there
[04:43:13] <antique> i mean for example i have a iframe document, and i need a copy of jQuery with this document content:)
[04:43:16] <tomasm-> hi, anyone know of a good 'toolip' or 'speech bubble' plugin that would be useful for tutorials, ie for a user interface (explaining what parts of a page are for etc)? I was hoping to have bubbles that I could have point to certain objects on screen and have a checkbox that would abort out of a fixed sequence of bubbles (which would appear in various places). qTip2 is kinda okay but I was wondering about other options
[04:43:23] <seutje> yes, that's 260KB of minified JS to render a few charts
[04:43:27] <Hornet> poshytip is okay
[04:43:34] <Cork> antique: bind a function name to a specific element?
[04:43:35] <Hornet> just google really
[04:43:37] <antique> $(selector, iframeDoc), but i want local$(selector)
[04:43:54] <Cork> antique: don't think you can actually
[04:44:14] <Cork> why not just do var frame = $(iframeDoc) frame.find() ?
[04:44:35] <tomasm-> the controls for the tip boxes i've seen so far (ie close, etc) seem kinda lousy
[04:44:45] <pythonsnake> hi
[04:44:45] <antique> i can, just want more  shortly :)
[04:45:00] <pythonsnake> sending requests : is it the neat way to send infos to server backend?
[04:47:07] <Hornet> Cork, I sent you a working URL in PM
[04:47:16] <Hornet> I'd do it publicly but it's a private system
[04:47:23] <Cork> uh i have pm disabled
[04:47:29] <Hornet> well that's handy
[04:47:38] <Cork> and i don't have time to dissect your page
[04:47:50] <Hornet> it's pretty simple when you see it
[04:47:53] <Cork> especially if its so complex that you don't feel you have time to do that your self
[04:48:04] <E_mE> Cork: this place is for answers not analysis
[04:48:11] <E_mE> opps
[04:48:15] <E_mE> Hornet: ^^^
[04:48:24] <Cork> well analysis is fine
[04:48:27] <Hornet> E_mE: whatever you think that means
[04:48:33] <Cork> if you actually try your self
[04:48:43] <Hornet> I'd not be here if I hadn't tried
[04:48:55] <Hornet> but I don't have time to strip the entire application away to prove that I am in fact right
[04:49:35] <E_mE> Hornet: you found a jquery problem?
[04:49:39] <Hornet> yes
[04:49:40] <Cork> no
[04:49:50] <xec> Hornet: more often than not, you realize what the bug is when reproducing the issue in a demo
[04:49:52] <Cork> its been proven that your str isn't failing
[04:49:58] <E_mE> Create a use case to re-produce the problem, then forward it to their ticketing system
[04:50:17] <Cork> E_mE: that is what we've been asking for from the start
[04:50:19] <Hornet> console.log(this) shows an element in the console, (this).parent().remove() removes the wrong element entirely
[04:50:24] <Hornet> I don't have time to do that
[04:50:27] <Cork> but he prefer to do the blame game
[04:50:31] <Hornet> oh ffs
[04:50:32] <E_mE> Cork: sorry
[04:51:11] <Hornet> if you push a button labelled 'sing a song' it's pretty obvious that something inherant is fucked up when it in fact plays the flute
[04:51:26] <Hornet> ideally yes I'd like to do it properly
[04:51:41] <Hornet> but a load of people squawing 'no test case = no problem' is BS
[04:51:47] <Cork> Hornet: we have followed your exact str, and tried, it works; we have tested with the same version of jquery you said is the "cause" and it works
[04:51:56] <Cork> what do you expect us to do?
[04:52:05] <Hornet> I made you a comp page to look at
[04:52:24] <Hornet> join #topsecrethackery if you have pms disabled then, I'll show you there
[04:52:26] <E_mE> Hornet: the point is, you need to isolate the suppose problem, to highlight the fact its not just your implementation thats causing htthe problem
[04:52:33] <Leentje> Hornet: give the parent tag you want removed its own unique id
[04:52:37] <Leentje> and call that to remove them
[04:52:41] <Leentje> there, problem solved
[04:52:50] <Hornet> no as this is a multiple instance situation
[04:52:58] <Hornet> and the element to remove is relative to the current
[04:53:15] <E_mE> Hornet: are multiple instances existing inside your application only?
[04:53:31] <Leentje> its nice thats it relative
[04:53:36] <Hornet> in this case there's only one row it operates on to prevent interference
[04:53:37] <xec> Hornet: so you have encountered the first non-reproducible "real bug" in history :)
[04:53:42] <Leentje> but that doesnt matter if it has its own id
[04:54:10] <Hornet> <div><span></span><a></a></div><div><span></span><a></a></div>
[04:54:14] <E_mE> Hornet: jsFiddle, try out your problems in there, see if you have the same problem
[04:54:18] <Hornet> I want to remove the span when an A is clicked
[04:54:20] <Cork> the id is still just a workaround though
[04:54:20] <xec> ?demo @ Hornet
[04:54:20] <b-ot> Hornet: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:54:21] <bot-t> Hornet, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:54:31] <Hornet> ffs
[04:54:34] <Cork> until the problem is reproducable its just, not a bug
[04:54:40] <Hornet> it is reproducable
[04:54:46] <xec> so do it
[04:54:46] <Leentje> then demonstrate it
[04:54:47] <Cork> no, cause it depends on your code
[04:54:48] <E_mE> xec: didn't relies there was a bot to repeat what i said :P
[04:54:55] <Cork> and is not reproducable without your code
[04:55:01] <Cork> meaning its most likely cause of your code
[04:55:13] <Hornet> you've not seen the code in question
[04:55:30] <Hornet> and unless something is changing the reference to 'this' within jquery itself yes it's a bug
[04:55:39] <pythonsnake> sending requests : is it the neat way to send infos to server backend?
[04:55:39] <Leentje> ffs Hornet , you're persistent
[04:55:46] <Hornet> because I'm right
[04:55:50] <Leentje> no you're not
[04:55:56] <Leentje> now ditch that attitude
[04:55:58] <Cork> pythonsnake: you mean ajax post?
[04:55:59] <Leentje> or you wont get help here
[04:56:09] <E_mE> Hornet: if you're so right, but your discovery into a jsfiddle use case
[04:56:10] <pythonsnake> POST request? Cork
[04:56:20] <Cork> pythonsnake: or was it just a generic question how to do it?
[04:56:25] <Leentje> Hornet: what E_mE said
[04:56:33] <E_mE> put*
[04:56:36] <Leentje> and if you're too good to do that, then dont ask for help here
[04:56:44] <pythonsnake> Cork: i got some infos/vars i need to send to server
[04:56:51] <pythonsnake> requests is the right way?
[04:56:55] <Hornet> I can't create this setup on jsfiddle
[04:57:02] <Cork> $.post @ pythonsnake
[04:57:03] <Hornet> would take far too long and most of the libs related aren't around
[04:57:05] <Leentje> jsfiddle is bugged then
[04:57:17] <Hornet> I've made a simple demo page already
[04:57:18] <Cork> aaand the bot died again
[04:57:20] <pythonsnake> thanks Cork
[04:57:36] <pythonsnake> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[04:57:55] <Cork> oh no lol i used $ instead of ? :x
[04:58:07] <Cork> bot-t: sorry
[04:58:07] <bot-t> http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ldazu28sVD1qdqv28o1_500.gif
[04:58:20] <Cork> LOL
[04:58:24] <Hornet> http://pastebin.com/WTmG4wdZ Leentje / E_mE
[04:58:30] <Hornet> bug is at line 43ish
[04:58:39] <Cork> Hornet: common, pb != demo
[04:58:39] <Hornet> so you tell me what is so radical there that might be interfering
[04:58:45] <Cork> its a dump of static none working code
[04:58:48] <Hornet> I'm well aware of that
[04:58:51] <Leentje> adding // <insert text here> to your code is not a demo
[04:58:52] <Hornet> I didn't say it was a demo
[04:58:58] <Leentje> we cant play with that
[04:59:03] <Leentje> we dotn even know what you want it to do
[04:59:07] <Leentje> we have to guess it from the code
[04:59:23] <xec> Hornet: at this point you increasingly resemble a troll
[04:59:27] <Cork> Hornet: stop waisting ppls time, if you want help, provide something for ppl to help you with
[04:59:30] <Hornet> and you resemble a groupthink
[04:59:34] <Hornet> sigh
[05:00:06] <Cork> its basic irc help asking 101
[05:00:12] <Hornet> if I do somehow make a demo by cloning this to another url, you'll then want a 'simple demo'
[05:00:18] <Hornet> which I don't have time to do either
[05:00:32] <xec> hornet: time spent arguing the channel is time that could be spent making a demo, and actually solving the issue
[05:00:39] <Hornet> it'd take much longer
[05:00:48] <Leentje> not if you keep this up :P
[05:00:48] <Cork> Hornet: if you can make a modifiable demo that reproduces the problem, where all the needed components are in, and its not 10000+ lines, its fine
[05:01:04] <Cork> but ya, you would have to reduce it to < 500 lines of js + html and css
[05:01:15] <Cork> else its just pointless
[05:02:12] <E_mE> Hornet: $(this). on line 43
[05:02:16] <Cork> but the really important part is that is shows the bug and is short enough to not take hours for someone unfamiliar with the code to reduce it
[05:02:46] <Hornet> E_mE?
[05:03:01] <E_mE> $(this).parentNode.parentNode.removeChild(this.parentNode);
[05:03:08] <xec> E_mE: nope
[05:03:25] <E_mE> okay me shut up now :)
[05:03:33] <Cork> parentNode doesn't exist in jquery
[05:03:43] <Hornet> that's the solution not the bug, E_mE
[05:03:48] <Cork> its a native dom element memeber
[05:03:56] <Hornet> if I used $(this).parent().remove() instead of that line, it'd delete a node prior to the parent
[05:04:15] <E_mE> have you tried console.log()ing each parent() level?
[05:04:26] <Hornet> if I use $(this).parent().hide() instead, the right element is hidden
[05:04:31] <Hornet> oddly enough yes
[05:04:37] <Hornet> I did cover all this earlier in channel
[05:04:45] <E_mE> okay.. me return to work then :)
[05:05:09] <chilversc_> Hornet: that is a pity you don't have the time, because I don't have time to go wading through the code to find out what it is actually doing versus should be doing, fortunatly its not my problem either so I don't have to care
[05:05:32] <Hornet> chilversc: there's nothing to wade.
[05:05:53] <Hornet> it's a simple example that it screws up, .remove destroys a node , .hide works
[05:05:57] <Hornet> in the same situation
[05:06:08] <Hornet> there's nothing subjective about it
[05:06:10] <Hornet> jquery fucks up
[05:06:24] <Hornet> thankfully that isn't my problem either, it's an issue for everyone who uses jquery
[05:06:26] <Hornet> so enjoy.
[05:06:33] <Cork> heh
[05:06:45] <Cork> funny that noone else gets the problem then
[05:06:48] <Hornet> anyway, I've solved it for myself, and I need to get on with the rest of the application
[05:06:49] <zlomerovic> any Bosnians here?
[05:06:51] <Hornet> maybe they did
[05:06:58] <Hornet> this is a slightly older library
[05:07:15] <Cork> Hornet: i've been using jquery since 1.0
[05:07:25] <chilversc_> Hornet: there is wading, for me to debug it, I need a simple sample that I can execute and quickly verify the result, and then tweak, preferably on something like jsfiddle where I can get rapid feedback
[05:07:31] <Cork> and yes i've used remove plenty of times
[05:07:53] <yogurt_truck> Hornet: maybe try cleaning up the code. that god awful horrible mess of spaghetti code makes it hard for everyone, including yourself to find where the bug is
[05:08:19] <yogurt_truck> Hornet: in the bug is most likely in your code, not jquery's
[05:08:42] <Cork> and your biggest problem to getting help, is your attitude
[05:08:56] <Cork> prove that your code works, then work downwards
[05:09:02] <Cork> don't start by blaming the base
[05:09:12] <Hornet> yogurt_truck: kindly please explain what I could be doing that will make $(this).parent().hide() remove the right element, while $(this).parent.remove() removes the wrong node entirely
[05:09:14] <Cork> cause thats rarely productive
[05:09:20] <zlomerovic> any bosnians, serbs, croats, slovenians, montenegrans, macedonians, albanians, hungarians, italians - please contact me in PRIVATE!
[05:09:34] <yogurt_truck> whenever you are in the situation where you "don't have time to make a case example" to test the behavior, you know it's time to refactor, big time. :D
[05:09:38] <Cork> Hornet: your too fixated with that line
[05:09:50] <Hornet> Cork, the 'attitude' is better known as a 'reaction'
[05:09:54] <Cork> Hornet: its most likely a series of events and thats what triggers it
[05:10:16] <Cork> Hornet: something isn't working, its your fault; won't ever be productive
[05:10:30] <Hornet> I'm not saying it's 'your fault'
[05:10:37] <Cork> you need this is what my code does, i can't see how it could cause it
[05:10:40] <Cork> can you look at it
[05:10:44] <Hornet> I've tried that
[05:10:45] <Cork> and then someone can start from there
[05:10:51] <Cork> no you haven't
[05:10:58] <Hornet> I made you a damn comp page
[05:11:00] <Cork> your first line was "theres a bug in remove"
[05:11:04] <Hornet> as I can't reproduce this on fiddle
[05:11:19] <Cork> that should tell you something
[05:11:34] <Hornet> that I have a nontrivial application?
[05:11:46] <Hornet> fiddle is great for snippets
[05:11:48] <Cork> that you have a bug in your nontrivial application
[05:11:54] <Cork> and it fails in some cases
[05:12:08] <Hornet> the application logic is irrelevant to that snippet
[05:12:15] <Cork> and you should be hunting for the bug instead of hunting for workarounds from the consequences
[05:12:20] <Hornet> I've tried that
[05:12:28] <Cork> sigh
[05:12:31] <Hornet> (this) is always the correct/expected node
[05:12:37] <Hornet> whatever the situtation
[05:12:43] <Hornet> the only change is when remove is used instead of hide
[05:12:49] <Hornet> and that's when it fucks up
[05:13:08] <Hornet> nothing lower removes anything from the dome
[05:13:13] <Hornet> so that can't be an issue
[05:13:18] <Hornet> *dom
[05:13:21] <Cork> /ignore Hornet*!* chan
[05:13:43] <Hornet> whatever, pardon me for being correct
[05:14:05] <Hornet> I realise you want a fiddle but that's not possible, I've done the best I could anyway
[05:14:13] <xec> Hornet: you've been told multiple times what's needed for us to start helping you. either make a demo or no help. simple.
[05:14:17] <Hornet> and a rational discussion is more than possible without one despite that
[05:14:24] <xec> of course it is possible
[05:14:29] <Hornet> it is not needed
[05:14:31] <Leentje> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/remove-removes-the-wrong-element
[05:14:34] <Hornet> jesus you're sentient beings
[05:14:36] <Leentje> read that hornet
[05:14:37] <Leentje> might help
[05:14:40] <Hornet> fiddle is not your lifeline
[05:15:02] <Leentje> since i see you using closest()
[05:16:05] <Hornet> aka my selector might be matching the wrong element?
[05:16:13] <Hornet> I've confirmed many times that it does not
[05:16:49] <yogurt_truck> Hornet: you haven't proved there's a bug, and you haven't provided a working jsfiddle with the markup structure and a working test case. so you're not helping anyone and no one is able to help you. and given that your code looks like shit, the safe bet is that somewhere _you_ are fucking up, no jQuery core
[05:17:04] <yogurt_truck> but again, what you've given isn't even enough to submit a bug ticket
[05:17:55] <yogurt_truck> so... go refactor your code
[05:18:05] <Hornet> the code is fine
[05:18:15] <Hornet> I put the json there just for simplicity
[05:18:20] <Hornet> usually it's elsewhere
[05:18:23] <yogurt_truck> yes, you say that
[05:18:49] <Cork> yogurt_truck: you're wasting your time
[05:18:57] <yogurt_truck> but still, go refactor it. you _will_ find where _you_ are fucking up. and read the docs for every jquery function you're using
[05:19:12] <yogurt_truck> Cork: you're right
[05:19:23] * yogurt_truck goes get some coffee :D
[05:20:08] <Hornet> sigh
[05:20:30] <Hornet> so because I'm unable to distill this to a simple case, people can't be bothered to think and instead start insulting me
[05:20:36] <Hornet> how wonderful.
[05:22:16] <masentinel900> Hello guys!!
[05:23:53] <hiby007> hi everyone
[05:24:06] <masentinel900> Guys if I have this  ::  var a = $(".myclassSelector")
[05:24:34] <masentinel900> and I need to access to id of that input.
[05:24:42] <masentinel900> how will be?
[05:24:51] <masentinel900> a.attr('id')
[05:25:27] <NeuroSerpens> has anyone in here been tinkering enough with jqueryui to know why textareas do not explode?
[05:28:07] <Cork> masentinel900: yes
[05:28:51] <Cork> NeuroSerpens: just guessing, but as it clone the element and then use overflow to hide sections
[05:28:56] <Cork> it might have to do with that
[05:29:17] <Cork> NeuroSerpens: are you using explode directly on the textarea?
[05:29:22] <NeuroSerpens> yeppers
[05:29:29] <hiby007> i have made a simple table and want to remove a row when x is clicked, here is the code (http://jsfiddle.net/MKhJR/) everything works fine except when last item is removed the whole table should go away how to do this
[05:29:34] <Cork> have you tried adding a wrapper adoung it and doing it on that?
[05:29:41] <Cork> *around
[05:29:46] <NeuroSerpens> i have tried doing it in several parents of it
[05:30:00] <Cork> and it never manage with the textarea?
[05:30:19] <NeuroSerpens> i had noticed the cloning, because 'something' explodes behind it while it remains intact
[05:30:34] <Cork> can't say i've seen it, but i suspect its a limitation with that kind of form element
[05:30:36] <NeuroSerpens> and then when the ghost finishes exploding the textarea vanishes
[05:30:49] <NeuroSerpens> hm i just had an idea
[05:30:51] * Cork nods
[05:32:02] <NeuroSerpens> shit... lmao
[05:32:09] <Cork> ?
[05:32:30] <NeuroSerpens> i tried making it disappear right after the clone started exploding behind it, but it made the clone vanish too
[05:32:33] <NeuroSerpens> hahahaha
[05:32:35] <NeuroSerpens> i'm screwed
[05:32:38] <NeuroSerpens> :p
[05:32:57] <Cork> NeuroSerpens: could you try making a testcase of the problem?
[05:33:04] <NeuroSerpens> testcase?

[05:33:08] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:33:28] <hiby007> can someone help me with this

[05:33:49] <Cork> NeuroSerpens: what bot-t linked to
[05:33:56] <NeuroSerpens> o lol
[05:34:05] <NeuroSerpens> you want me to paste my code to jsfiddle
[05:34:05] <NeuroSerpens> ok
[05:34:07] <Cork> as in add the html needed css and the js code to trigger the problem
[05:34:25] <Cork> there might be some css rules that MIGHT solve it
[05:34:31] <NeuroSerpens> nice
[05:35:03] <Cork> haven't exploded that many textareas though, so i have to look at it first :)
[05:35:19] <NeuroSerpens> haha :p
[05:35:24] <NeuroSerpens> this is my first
[05:35:33] <Cork> :D
[05:36:56] <masentinel900> Hello guys!!
[05:37:15] <hiby007> hello guys can anyone help me please
[05:37:24] <masentinel900> If i have this ::  var a = $(".myclassInput")
[05:37:38] <Cork> hiby007: opps forgot your question, sorry
[05:37:43] <hiby007> 	i have made a simple table and want to remove a row when x is clicked, here is the code (http://jsfiddle.net/MKhJR/) everything works fine except when last item is removed the whole table should go away how to do this
[05:37:46] <masentinel900> And I need to show in alert the id of that input, how can I do it?
[05:38:11] <masentinel900> alert(a.attr('id'))
[05:38:18] <undef1`> try a.attr('id')[0]
[05:38:53] <Cork> hiby007: http://jsfiddle.net/MKhJR/1/
[05:39:04] <Cork> uh
[05:39:09] <Cork> no a.attr('id')
[05:39:10] <xec> undef1`: what on earth? :D
[05:39:18] <Cork> [0] would grab the first char of the id
[05:39:30] <undef1`> oh yeah sorry
[05:39:35] <xec> masentinel900: are you sure it has an ID ?
[05:39:47] <undef1`> mootools fucks me up at times :\
[05:40:04] <Cork> hiby007: did you catch that?
[05:40:22] <hiby007> cork when last item is left and (x) is clicked the table heading should go away
[05:40:52] <Cork> hiby007: also please don't use broken a tags
[05:40:56] <Hornet> for attention of anyone who cares: the issue is probably within a plugin, which has events triggered via remove() that raw dom removal does not
[05:40:58] <Cork> if you don't want a link use span instead
[05:41:34] <hiby007> ok let me correct it and try cork
[05:41:36] <Hornet> which we managed to work out via a rational discussion, without the use of a jsfiddle at any point
[05:41:41] <Hornet> shock, horror.
[05:41:59] <masentinel900> <xec>: yes
[05:42:11] <masentinel900> <a id="createProyOP1" class="creProMo" data-fancybox-type="ajax">Add Company to Sector</a>
[05:42:12] <xec> masentinel900: well, in that case your snippet should work
[05:42:16] <Hornet> my thanks to Leentje for being more sensible than the rest of you
[05:42:30] <masentinel900> I get it by the class, and need to show the id
[05:43:35] <xec> masentinel900: http://jsfiddle.net/4U6fk/
[05:43:52] <hiby007> cork > using span does not solve the problem. http://jsfiddle.net/MKhJR/2/
[05:44:31] <Cork> hiby007: no it wasn't the source of the problem, was just me requestion ;)
[05:44:42] <Cork> give me a min i'm working on it
[05:44:52] <hiby007> ok thanks
[05:45:50] <Cork> another side note your first td isn't closed <td style="vertical-align:middle;"><td>
[05:46:46] <ericandrewlewis> if i wanted to desaturate, bend color balance and apply a radial gradient on an image, and take away these effects on hover, do you think i should do it with some jquery/js image manipulation library?
[05:47:08] <hiby007> thanks, will correct it
[05:47:18] <ericandrewlewis> or do some server-side image manipulation
[05:47:47] <Cork> hiby007: http://jsfiddle.net/MKhJR/3/
[05:48:05] <hiby007> WOW Cork works great
[05:48:11] <hiby007> many thanks
[05:48:13] <hiby007> :D
[05:48:13] <Cork> np
[05:48:42] <Cork> i replaced hide() for the td's with a class to make a simpler selector for the heder
[05:48:44] <Cork> *header
[05:49:01] <Cork> hiby007: i also added thead and tbody to the html to make the selecting simpler again
[05:49:12] <Cork> else you would have to look for th and other horrible things
[05:49:25] <NeuroSerpens> lmao cork i forgot i went to jsfiddle to share the problem
[05:49:34] <NeuroSerpens> and ended up testing up to now by  myself
[05:49:35] <NeuroSerpens> hahaha
[05:49:37] <hiby007> oh ok ... great trick
[05:49:38] <NeuroSerpens> http://jsfiddle.net/CJXxg/
[05:49:38] <Cork> NeuroSerpens: :D
[05:49:44] <NeuroSerpens> there it is
[05:50:00] <NeuroSerpens> the button "destruir" should do that trick
[05:50:02] <NeuroSerpens> i was telling u
[05:50:03] <Cork> NeuroSerpens: headers should always be a thead if its a row
[05:50:09] <Cork> makes life simpler
[05:50:43] <NeuroSerpens> what?
[05:50:45] <Cork> NeuroSerpens: ooh, loverly uh, something
[05:50:46] <NeuroSerpens> sorry i didn't get that
[05:51:00] <Cork> opps the first was for hiby007
[05:51:05] <Cork> sorry
[05:51:10] <NeuroSerpens> lololol
[05:52:05] <hiby007> Cork i am trying one other thing on that table , onclick editing
[05:52:27] <hiby007> if i don't find anything on the internet will have to come for help again
[05:52:46] <Cork> NeuroSerpens: side note textarea#vent textarea is pointless there
[05:52:50] <Cork> it only makes the selector slower
[05:53:03] <Cork> you can't ever be more specific then #vent in that case
[05:53:33] <Cork> same with all the other id's
[05:55:17] <NeuroSerpens> yea... it's kind of an organization obsession
[05:55:32] <Cork> hmm suspected as much
[05:55:38] <Cork> NeuroSerpens:  http://jsfiddle.net/CJXxg/1/
[05:55:46] <Cork> its transform breaking things
[05:55:53] <NeuroSerpens> >:O lets see
[05:56:13] <NeuroSerpens> :|
[05:56:21] <NeuroSerpens> u only took the transform i need out lmao
[05:56:29] <xec> ericandrewlewis: i doubt the browser support is very good, but you can probably get quite far with SVG effects
[05:56:42] <NeuroSerpens> that was ambiguous
[05:56:50] <NeuroSerpens> you only took out the transform i need lmao
[05:57:10] <Cork> NeuroSerpens: http://jsfiddle.net/CJXxg/2/
[05:57:15] <Cork> kinda works
[05:57:23] <Cork> the real breaker is the one in the css
[05:57:39] <NeuroSerpens> i laughed hard at this
[05:57:49] <NeuroSerpens> xD
[05:58:01] <Cork> i suspect its as simple as that jqueryui effect doesn't take transform into account
[05:58:08] <NeuroSerpens> yea :p
[05:58:09] <anew> http://www.yelp.com/writeareview/biz/WavvLdfdP6g8aZTtbBQHTw?return_url=%2Fwriteareview%2Fsearch%3Fwar_desc%3DGary%2BDanko%26war_loc%3DSan%2BFrancisco%252C%2BCA
[05:58:16] <anew> how would i reproduce this hover with jq ?
[05:58:18] <Cork> it is a REALLY complicated attribute to handle
[05:58:18] <ericandrewlewis> xec: interesting. i need to fool around more with SVG. not good browser support though :(
[05:58:23] <anew> when you hover over the stars you see
[05:58:26] * Cork signs off
[05:58:27] <NeuroSerpens> i had another idea
[05:58:50] <NeuroSerpens> i think i'll try to check if it creates another element with the same selector and try to make only the first one disappear
[05:59:20] <ericandrewlewis> actually i take that back, i was looking at the wrong css selector on caniuse
[06:00:00] <xec> ericandrewlewis: http://caniuse.com/svg-filters
[06:00:21] <xec> much better than i thought, tbh
[06:00:45] <NeuroSerpens> holy crap lmfao
[06:00:51] <NeuroSerpens> it creates an element for each piece
[06:03:04] <anew> any help with recreating that hover effect in yelp ?
[06:05:43] <ericandrewlewis> anew: you can have separate img elements, with different callbacks for on hover for each
[06:06:37] <xec> anew: what ericandrewlewis said. also google css sprites, and see http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/assets/2/www/img/cf83b0435f1b/ico/stars/v2/stars_large_map.png
[06:06:47] <krz> when i click on the element i get two console logs. why?
[06:06:55] <krz> shouldn't the first condition prevail?
[06:07:38] <anew> xec i'm looking at that sprite right now... but how would i put that into a jq plugin ?
[06:07:48] <anew> i see there are a ton of star rating plugins
[06:08:36] <xec> anew: should be quite simple to roll your own if you grasp the basic concept
[06:08:50] <Snoopal> hey guys. i got radiobuttons with the name data[Answer][fr1] now i want to use these in my selection aswell i tried: $('input.radio[name=data\[Answer\]\[fr1\]]:checked').val(); but didnt work. any ideas?
[06:08:54] <anew> roll my own
[06:09:09] <xec> s/roll/write
[06:09:31] <anew> looks so hard tho
[06:09:35] <anew> any kind of starting point
[06:09:36] <krz> anyone?
[06:09:40] <anew> u can point me in the right direction ?
[06:09:57] <xec> anew: yes, do you know what css sprites are?
[06:10:01] <Snoopal> ah! had to use two \
[06:10:08] <anew> yes it's that image you just linked me to
[06:10:15] <xec> anew: not really
[06:10:29] <anew> what
[06:10:31] <anew> that is a sprite
[06:10:33] <anew> that link
[06:10:52] <Snoopal> hmm it triggers me "undefinied" but its set :(
[06:10:58] <xec> anew: no it's just an image. css sprites is the concept of creating a box to show only part of it
[06:11:12] <anew> which is what they are using ?
[06:11:40] <xec> yes. so all you need to do to create that effect is to position the background image according to what star you're hovering
[06:12:14] <krz> https://gist.github.com/krzkrzkrz/5090529 forgot the paste
[06:12:31] <krz> https://gist.github.com/krzkrzkrz/5090529 when i click on the element i get two console logs. why? shouldn't the first condition prevail?
[06:12:37] <anew> one question
[06:12:39] <anew> with positioning
[06:12:49] <anew> you have to put in the positino of each image you want ?
[06:12:53] <anew> how do you knwo what it is
[06:13:18] <xec> measure it? :)
[06:13:41] <anew> right  but how do i do that? with a pixle ruler ?
[06:13:49] <xec> for example
[06:14:33] <Snoopal> $('input.radio[name=data\[Answer\]\[fr1\]]:checked').val(); <- whats the correct syntax to obtain the value of the radio with the name data[Answer][fr1] ?
[06:15:07] <masentinel900> xecGuys!!
[06:15:17] <masentinel900> Can I get a var like this?
[06:15:18] <masentinel900> var d = <?php echo $select?>
[06:15:37] <danheberden> Snoopal: $('input[type="radio"][name="data\[Answer\]\[fr1\]:checked').val()
[06:15:55] <danheberden> what is that, cakephp?
[06:15:56] <xec> masentinel900: that depends entirely on what the php renders, and where that code is
[06:16:22] <krz> anyone?!
[06:16:22] <masentinel900> $data = array( 			'select' => $this->input->post('value') 			);
[06:16:33] <masentinel900> That is the php script!!
[06:16:41] <danheberden> masentinel900: normally the best way would be to put whatever you'll need in an object and have one spot you put all the things
[06:17:32] <danheberden> <script>window.app = window.app || {}; app.serverShit = $.parseJSON('<?php echo json_encode($theThings); ?>'); </script>
[06:17:36] <danheberden> or whatever
[06:18:11] <danheberden> and then window.serverShit.thatOneThingIWanted;
[06:18:14] <danheberden> ugh
[06:18:17] <danheberden> app.serverShit.theThing
[06:18:19] <danheberden> you get the idea
[06:18:25] <masentinel900> <danheberden>: How is thta?
[06:18:47] <danheberden> how is what?
[06:35:15] <krz> anyone: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15226198/why-is-the-on-click-event-being-triggered#15226270
[06:40:12] <shoky> krz: what?
[06:40:27] <BillCriswell> krz: Can you show it in regular javascript?
[06:40:41] <shoky> i dont understand his question at all
[06:40:49] <BillCriswell> Actually... this still doesn't make sense.
[06:40:50] <shoky> it's supposed to output 'here', what's the problem
[06:41:05] <krz> shoky: yes it does. but it also outputs 'not here'
[06:41:12] <shoky> oh
[06:41:30] <shesek> danheberden, you don't need all that
[06:41:43] <BillCriswell> krz: Can you post the processed javascript?
[06:41:46] <shesek> app.serverShit = <?php echo json_encode($theThings); ?> would work just as well
[06:42:06] <krz> BillCriswell: http://pastie.org/6391067
[06:42:17] <danheberden> shesek: aye
[06:42:34] <shoky> krz see xec's comment
[06:42:56] <danheberden> but recommending jsonparse will give someone new to this the oppurtunity to see an invalid json obj
[06:43:18] <BillCriswell> krz: http://jsbin.com/udeqon/1/edit I got the expected result here.
[06:43:25] <krz> hm
[06:43:28] <BillCriswell> Do you have any code elsewhere that may be doing something else similar?
[06:43:36] <pachet> your coffeescript transcompiler needs a tuneup
[06:44:17] <krz> not that i am aware of. but looking around now
[06:44:28] <xec> krz: if you didn't see my comment on SO - check out http://jsfiddle.net/55Ta2/ - as expected only the first handler is ever bound
[06:44:39] <krz> xec yea saw that one
[06:45:04] <BillCriswell> coffee script is so weird to me.
[06:45:09] <xec> BillCriswell++
[06:46:03] <xec> BillCriswell: you can go to coffeescript.org click on "try coffeescript" and paste the code -> run
[06:46:23] <xec> BillCriswell: will compile it to vanilla js and make it readable :)
[06:46:37] <krz> "readable"
[06:46:55] <xec> well, for people used to normal js syntax at least
[06:47:21] <BillCriswell> xec: I can't even write SASS without adding all the braces and semi-colons. I seriously doubt I'd be able to do it with Javascript.
[06:47:35] <pachet> s/readable/not a bastardized ruby python beast/
[06:48:14] <shoky> if only you could type fn instead of function in js, it'd be perfect !
[06:49:08] <shoky> whut where did that exclamation mark come from
[06:49:22] <BillCriswell> shoky: I snuck it in there to drive you mad.
[06:49:25] <xec> shoky: when reading source i always read "function" as "funkytown" - improves the entertainment value by a factor of 3
[06:49:32] <shoky> pahaha
[06:49:42] <BillCriswell> funk shion.
[06:49:42] <shoky> good plan
[06:49:50] <pachet> conjunction junction
[06:49:53] <pachet> what's your function
[06:50:27] <shoky> lets see some suction ?
[06:51:13] <pachet> was that the next line in the song?
[06:51:28] <xec> there's a function song?`
[06:51:58] <BillCriswell> pachet: I always thought that was the whole song.
[06:52:30] <pachet> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPeI3hd11_g
[06:52:51] <pachet> they do say 'function' a lot
[06:52:54] <BillCriswell> I need to use adblock.
[06:53:26] <xec> pachet: i just googled it. fun fact; it's 12 times
[06:53:34] <jonjo> anyone know why this returns the wrong length http://bpaste.net/show/GqBoAXg0pIo7HL1ASSMj/ ?
[06:53:46] <pachet> i think shoky was lying
[06:53:52] <pachet> i never heard 'suction'
[06:53:52] <BillCriswell> This song is actually pretty awesome.
[06:54:05] <pachet> making me doubt my american upbringing ;[
[06:54:43] <shoky> sry i thought you were lying too. my bad
[06:55:18] <pachet> heh
[06:55:26] <pachet> jonjo: put everything after the first line in a callback
[06:55:42] <pachet> $(whatever).load(wherever, function(){ --> put stuff here <--- })
[06:56:31] <krz> xec
[06:56:36] <krz> post your comment as an answer
[06:56:46] <krz> the problem was somewhere in my code
[06:56:50] <BillCriswell> http://designmodo.github.com/Flat-UI/ This guy did a bang up job on this.
[06:57:02] <krz> coffee script wasn't complaining but i must have had invalid syntax
[06:57:51] <shoky> yeah xec if you do it you'll pass my rep
[06:58:04] <BillCriswell> krz: Do you enjoy writing coffeescript that much more than vanilla javascript?
[06:58:08] <shoky> im 3 pts higher
[06:58:28] <krz> BillCriswell: very much
[06:58:36] <krz> the same with sass vs css
[06:59:03] <pachet> coffeescript is just one more thing i have to worry about compiling ;[
[06:59:05] <BillCriswell> krz: SASS is pretty damn close to CSS though.
[06:59:18] <krz> BillCriswell: not without a few perks. like mixins
[06:59:37] <BillCriswell> I'm speaking syntax wise.
[06:59:40] <krz> nesting helps a lot too
[06:59:53] <BillCriswell> krz: Yes. Nesting is great.
[06:59:55] <krz> removes redundant code and easier to maintain
[06:59:58] <shoky> how did that wrong answer on SO become comments ?
[07:00:15] <BillCriswell> krz: SASS or Coffeescript?
[07:00:24] <krz> huh?
[07:00:28] <krz> oh
[07:00:29] <jonjo> pachet: :)
[07:00:43] <krz> BillCriswell: both
[07:01:02] <BillCriswell> I don't think I ever realized SASS did that.
[07:01:36] <krz> well consider having to modify a ton of code under the same id, without nesting
[07:01:44] <krz> lets say if you wanted to change the id name
[07:01:56] <BillCriswell> I wish SASS removed parent selectors if they weren't needed. If I have .header .header-logo {} and .header-logo is only used as a child of that, I think it should remove the .header parent. ( as an option if you're not working with just one stylesheet ).
[07:01:56] <jonjo> pachet able to explain the difference?
[07:02:00] <krz> easier to read as well
[07:02:33] <pachet> jonjo: .load() operates asynchronously
[07:02:43] <pachet> because it takes time for the browser to request whatever content you're wanting
[07:02:44] <krz> besides. coding something in nodejs with vanilla js seems a bit archaic
[07:03:09] <pachet> so the lines after that one are executed in the meantime, even though the content you requested is still loading 'in the background'
[07:03:09] <jonjo> got ya, thanks
[07:03:27] <jonjo> that is where I have been going wrong
[07:03:30] <jonjo> alot..
[07:04:05] <jonjo> am use to C and C++
[07:04:05] <BillCriswell> krz: Absolutely. It won't remove redundant code code. I can do .blue { color: blue; } .blue { color: blue; } and both will put out.
[07:04:15] <BillCriswell> redundant code, though*
[07:05:24] <BillCriswell> krz: I think I'd just have to give coffeescript a far shot to see if it's worth it to me.
[07:05:39] <krz> haml, sass, coffee script. all tools to make a devs life easier
[07:06:00] <krz> coffee script also goes well in hand, if you are familiar with ruby
[07:06:06] <krz> beautiful language
[07:06:33] <BillCriswell> krz: I am not. I can write PHP and that's the extent of things.. and anything looks prettier than that.
[07:06:35] <krz> stuff like interpolation "hello #{var}"
[07:07:01] <xec> krz: i recommend you delete the SO question instead. i wouldn't want to surpass shoky (also i'm apparently not allowed to post a link to jsfiddle without also posting some code)
[07:07:07] <krz> try ruby/rails. i used to be a PHP dev. so glad i changed languages
[07:08:09] <krz> "hello #{var}" instead of 'hello '+var
[07:08:21] <pachet> php has interpolation ;[
[07:08:22] <krz> foo.bar instead of foo['bar']
[07:08:28] <xec> you mean 'hello'.var
[07:08:34] <xec> :/
[07:08:37] <BillCriswell> "Hello {$planet}" haha.
[07:08:38] <krz> im referring to coffeee
[07:08:40] <shoky> thx xec ;D
[07:09:03] <krz> or even foo? instead of if foo !== undefined
[07:11:15] <BillCriswell> Does HAML only output to <%= foo.bar %> type variables?
[07:11:37] <krz> haven't used haml in our project yet
[07:11:47] <krz> sorry can't say much. but getting there soon
[07:13:28] <krz> stumbling upon coffee and sass is just as fun and getting into redis
[07:13:45] <krz> although redis was a lot more fun :-)
[07:13:56] <krz> a lot of fun*
[07:14:24] <krz> an then theirs hadoop
[07:14:35] <krz> there's*
[07:14:38] <xec> and*
[07:14:43] <krz> ^^
[07:17:02] <krz> finally done with a single page iPhone web app!
[07:17:42] <xec> grz krz!
[07:20:04] <xec> anything public, that we can check out? :)
[07:20:28] <gotwig> dblosevn: hello
[07:20:33] <gotwig> Ok, I have a big question
[07:21:03] <bnason> Is there anywhere that shows what version of jquery is needed by a specific version of jquery-ui?
[07:21:06] <gotwig> I dont know if its really javascript related, but here is it: I got an add area, for adding different li tags with content, etc. on one side with the DOM, on the other side I got PHP
[07:21:26] <bnason> I'm attempting to modify a legacy site using an older jquery, however the newest jquery ui uses features not in it
[07:21:30] <gotwig> Now, when I create a div element, the element has to get the id from the database
[07:21:41] <gotwig> but for that the user has to wait, the action is for him not instantly
[07:21:44] <gotwig> how can I fix that??
[07:22:03] <krz> xec: hehe hmmm. ill let you know when its in production
[07:22:13] <gotwig> set an extra flag on the div, that says this div is not complete, and after it is complete, update the dom, and remove the flag?
[07:22:17] <gotwig> dblosevn: ^
[07:22:20] <mape> Has there been a solution for this issue? (not being able to use ajax and post data on IE10) http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12790
[07:22:29] <gotwig> the actions for adding new content should be instant
[07:22:35] <gotwig> users dont want to wait for that, I am sure.
[07:29:44] <abby_j> are you attempting to use ajax gotwig ... and forcing the user to wait as the information populates?
[07:36:46] <tomasm-> hi, anyone know of a good toolip/speech bubble plugin that would be useful for tutorials of a web interface? I would like boxes to pop up and point to various regions of a screen to help explain a user interface.... the content needs to load remotely via ajax (more than a one-liner 'title'). maybe something other than qtip?
[07:37:01] <Jester86> hello
[07:37:05] <tomasm-> and not css3 (since i gotta cater to older IE)
[07:38:03] <Jester86> Can anyone tell me if what I am trying to do is possible.  I am looking to filter my jQ selector down to images that have a css-top setting of -585px
[07:38:58] <Jester86> Can this be done in the selector or do I need to iterate through all of the images and look at the top via .css('top')
[07:39:20] <tomasm-> Jester86, why not have that value assigned to a class, then filter on the class? instead of explicitly setting 'top'
[07:39:26] <shoky> Jester86: you can use .filter(function(){ ... })
[07:39:31] <Gho5t> Jester86: the latter
[07:39:33] <Gho5t> using filter
[07:39:39] <Gho5t> Tomasm: no
[07:39:40] <Jester86> tomasm- .. sharepoint
[07:39:52] <xec> sharepoint--
[07:40:05] <Jester86> hmm thanks for filter, I will look into it more
[07:40:23] <pachet> if you're able to just add a class to those, that'll be way more performant :[
[07:40:34] <Jester86> I cannot .. it is in sharepoint
[07:40:41] <xec> sharepoint--
[07:40:49] <pachet> oh that's what you meant by that
[07:40:50] <xec> is there a karma bot in here?
[07:40:58] <pachet> xec: bot-t comes and goes
[07:41:06] <pachet> his wild ways will cost him, one of these days
[07:41:13] <shoky> ?karma sharepoint
[07:41:15] <bot-t> shoky, Couldn't find "karma sharepoint" in jQuery Docs.
[07:41:18] <shoky> :(
[07:41:25] <xec> ?nobotsnack
[07:41:26] <bot-t> xec, Couldn't find "nobotsnack" in jQuery Docs.
[07:41:28] <xec> ;D
[07:41:44] <Jester86> ?filter
[07:41:44] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[07:41:54] <pachet> maybe i'm thinking of ecmabot in #js
[07:42:11] <pachet> a la 'pachet gives a beer to xec. xec has 3e10 beers'
[07:42:49] <xec> hehe yea, that's what i was thinking about. i would love 3e10 beers.
[07:43:05] <xec> maybe not all at once
[07:43:41] <Jester86> can anyone help me with .filter for top=-585pxZ
[07:43:52] <Jester86> ?*
[07:43:56] <shoky> what've you tried so far?
[07:43:58] <Jester86> stupid dvorak
[07:44:21] <xec> .filter(function(){return $(this).css("top")===-585})
[07:44:27] <xec> something like that?
[07:44:37] <Jester86> I tried  $('#*myidhere* span img').filter('top=-585px')
[07:44:41] <Jester86> ok
[07:45:24] <shoky> :\
[07:46:49] <xec> or .filter(function(){return $(this).css("top")==="-585px"})
[07:47:00] <Jester86> shouldn't .filter be doing that on its own.. seems strange to me that you have to create a function within .filter.. at that point why not just use .each?
[07:47:18] <Jester86> yeah I have it working that way now.. it just seems odd to me
[07:47:39] <xec> Jester86: because filter takes a selector string, and there is no selector string that will look at css properties
[07:48:05] <Gho5t> filter is filtering the set and creating a jquery object that contains all matches
[07:48:13] <xec> Jester86: so yes, this is like doing .each in the sense that you're iterating through the collection
[07:48:37] <xec> in any case, i'm off. good luck!
[07:49:08] <Jester86> ahh.. alright.  So say that you have multiple images with top=-585px, .filter will return all of them, not just the first one?
[07:49:35] <xec> yes
[07:49:44] <Jester86> ok thanks
[07:58:38] <ill0> jsfiddle stuck on initializing the awesome for you guys lol?

[08:14:29] <Camber> Hi guys, could anyone help me understand this jquery error which google chrome is reporting? Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'call' of undefined
[08:14:43] <Camber> It says it's coming from jquery.js:27
[08:16:07] <Camber> Here's line 27, shamefully it's one of those compressed jquery files, really confusing to look at: http://pastebin.com/SZi0bAPC
[08:16:46] <Gho5t> if you're getting an error from within jquery, it usually means you have an error in your code
[08:16:49] <shoky> ?ftj @ Camber
[08:16:49] <bot-t> Camber, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[08:17:23] <Camber> Thanks shoky, I'll review that :)
[08:17:23] <Gho5t> that error seems to indicate you are attempting to do something on something that doesn't exist
[08:25:19] <Olive6767> I have an img tag and I would like to "slideshow" from one src to the next one, with a fade out/fade in effect, do I need in fact 2 img container to obtain a nice transition effect, or is there a way to do this using only one img container?
[08:26:38] <BillCriswell> Olive6767: You you can opacity maybe and when it hits 0 change the src of the image.
[08:27:39] <Olive6767> BillCriswell, but there won't be a way to have at the middle of the transition bother the previous image disapearing and the next img (src) appearing?
[08:27:54] <BillCriswell> Olive6767: Don't believe so.
[08:28:19] <Olive6767> ok, thx :-)
[08:30:13] <MalMen> if ($("#edituser")) is true even if there is not any object with that id ?
[08:30:21] <pachet> yes
[08:30:25] <pachet> check the length instead
[08:30:40] <pachet> if ( $('#edituser').length ) { }
[08:30:59] <MalMen> thank you :)

[08:31:45] <mathi> hi
[08:32:14] <mathi> I have .closeIcon element inside .chatroomLi element
[08:32:21] <mathi> both have an onclick event
[08:32:24] <mathi> '.closeIcon click' : function(el, ev) { ... }
[08:32:47] <mathi> if I click on the closeIcon element, unfortunately it will also trigger its parent '.chatroomLi click' : function(el, ev) { ... }
[08:33:04] <mathi> how can I avoid this ?
[08:33:19] <tubbo> hey guys
[08:33:30] <mathi> I tried to put ev.preventDefault(); inside .closeIcon click callback but it didn't help
[08:33:36] <pachet> ?.stopPropagation
[08:33:42] <pachet> meh
[08:33:55] <pachet> mathi: use event.stopPropagation() to prevent it from bubbling to the parent
[08:34:07] <mathi> I will try thanks!!
[08:34:11] <bot-t> event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/

[08:34:46] <solarflares> what
[08:35:15] <solarflares> the vatican made a tribute to the pope using turn.js and comic sans
[08:35:50] <pachet> God uses comic sans
[08:36:03] <solarflares> god uses papyrus
[08:36:10] <pachet> he wrote the ten commandments in comic sans
[08:36:33] <solarflares> okay the 10 commandments can be in comic sans, the rest is in papyrus
[08:38:26] <MindSpark> hi, in jqueryui I am using tabs and would like to know what the parameters event and ui are in the load callback
[08:41:48] <gnarf> MindSpark: event can probably be ignored, ui will contain information about what was loaded, console.log it
[08:42:18] <MindSpark> gnarf: I did, but it has so many variables I have no idea how to look for what I want
[08:42:25] <MindSpark> I need to know which tab was clicked
[08:42:41] <yooyo>  \"<div class='item'>\" + toAdd + \"</div>\" <-- what does the backslashes mean
[08:43:28] <Lolist> o/
[08:43:34] <systemfault> It means "escaping" the "
[08:43:47] <joikus_> I need to fire off an ajax call to my server when a user tries to close the tab/browser, is there a clean legit way for this?
[08:43:54] <joikus_> we're tracking the hours the user was logged in
[08:44:06] <gnarf> MindSpark: http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-load -- ui.tab ?
[08:44:09] <joikus_> but he might forget to "log off"
[08:44:12] <systemfault> yooyo: If you have "My name is "Ninja"!", how do you delimit the beginning of the end of the string?
[08:44:17] <NoiseEee> joikus_: no, there is no legit 100% way to do so
[08:44:22] <systemfault> *from the end
[08:44:32] <gnarf> ui.panel will be the actual area where the content is, ui.tab will be the tab clicked
[08:44:36] <joikus_> NoiseEee, I see - any suggestions?
[08:44:45] <pachet> joikus: there are ways that are 100% not legit
[08:44:47] <NoiseEee> joikus_: the best is to maybe track it in a db or some other means and infer
[08:45:04] <MindSpark> gnarf: oh, so two objects of type jquery?
[08:45:23] <gnarf> MindSpark: thats what the docs say, yup
[08:46:07] <MindSpark> gnarf: perfect, thanks
[08:46:52] <joikus_> NoiseEee, how to track in db?
[08:46:59] <joikus_> if there is no user action for me to log in the db
[08:47:25] <Gho5t> joikus_: maybe look into polling
[08:47:30] <joikus_> nasty
[08:47:49] <NoiseEee> joikus_: you can track their views and infer that when they've stopped, they've left
[08:48:14] <joikus_> hmm
[08:48:45] <joikus_> thing is, what if they're on it, but decide to click 'x'
[08:48:53] <joikus_> im dead right there
[08:49:04] <NoiseEee> joikus_: to be fair, your original question was "fire an ajax call to my server when a user tries to close the tab/browser"
[08:49:12] <joikus_> ya that wont work
[08:49:26] <NoiseEee> you CAN check when they "try", but you can't tell when they've actually closed it.
[08:54:04] <joikus_> thing is
[08:54:15] <joikus_> when you work at poor people jobs, and you have to punch in
[08:54:18] <joikus_> you have to punch out
[08:54:30] <joikus_> if you don't then, too bad

[09:02:42] <joikus_> javascript ninjas read code off post-its

[09:05:46] <tubbo> :D
[09:05:51] <tubbo> aaaaalright so hey guys
[09:05:56] <tubbo> jquery.migrate is the bestest.
[09:06:06] <Lolist> nou
[09:06:20] * Lolist starts fapping
[09:18:13] <E_mE> how can i bring in Raw HTML and make it traversable and append able?
[09:18:31] <E_mE> so i got <script id="moose"><tr><td>Cat</td></tr></script>
[09:18:53] <E_mE> i'm  $('#moose').clone().html()
[09:19:10] <E_mE> but i need to be able to populate it prior to insertion
[09:19:49] <BillCriswell> That moose ate a poor kitty?
[09:20:05] <systemfault> var foo = $($('#moose').html());
[09:20:21] <systemfault> E_mE: Change its type also...
[09:20:35] <E_mE> hmm, let me try
[09:20:40] <systemfault> E_mE: <script type="template/waheteverar">
[09:20:47] <E_mE> ahhh
[09:21:01] <E_mE> i thought type="" was deprecated
[09:21:06] <systemfault> E_mE: The default is text/javascript and you don't want that.
[09:21:14] <systemfault> E_mE: language is, not type AFAIK
[09:21:38] <E_mE> ah okay
[09:22:26] <E_mE> systemfault: Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression:
[09:22:28] <E_mE> :/
[09:22:42] <E_mE> i assume, because I've got <tr></tr> without the table tag
[09:22:46] <E_mE> so invalid HTML
[09:23:39] <pythonsnake> hey
[09:23:44] <pythonsnake> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5097184/pass-extra-variable-when-submitting-a-form-using-jquery
[09:24:08] <pythonsnake> I often see those when searching for how to send variables to the server.
[09:24:15] <pythonsnake> Is it the correct way?
[09:25:49] <shoky> E_mE: no its not because of html. did you set a type?
[09:25:57] <shoky> (not an empty type)
[09:26:00] <Lolist> hay gaize
[09:26:04] <Lolist> gues wat hapen
[09:26:09] <Lolist> :D
[09:26:38] <padmatcher> guys I am having so much trouble with jquery! its driving me nuts hahahaha
[09:26:44] <E_mE> shoky: http://pastebin.com/riy4F0mm
[09:27:04] <Lolist> padmatcher: google ember js
[09:27:14] <Lolist> kool framework
[09:27:15] <E_mE> and my code: var template = $($('#list-item-template').clone().html());
[09:28:18] <systemfault> It doesn't make sense to clone ...
[09:28:34] <E_mE> systemfault: i tried without clone() too
[09:28:38] <padmatcher> lolist: that is actually really interesting! I'm gonna look into that for future projects, but not what I need for this one
[09:28:51] <E_mE> i wanted a copy and inject it into the page, though seemed rational to create a copy
[09:29:02] <padmatcher> could someone take a look at my codepen? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Hnqea
[09:29:16] <shoky> E_mE:  you need to $.trim the html
[09:29:30] <shoky> since jquery 1.9 i think
[09:29:34] <padmatcher> the problem is that not each div opens when clicked
[09:29:37] <systemfault> Hmm.. or perhap use $.parseHTML
[09:29:46] <shoky> ah right
[09:29:46] <padmatcher> and I cant get a delay animation to work
[09:30:44] <E_mE> shoky: you are indeed a Gem :) thank you
[09:30:48] <padmatcher> im obviously new to this... any suggestions?
[09:31:10] <E_mE> systemfault: sounds safer your method
[09:31:17] <shoky> ;]
[09:32:40] <padmatcher> Anyone know why Im having issues adding a .delay() to an animation?
[09:35:04] <padmatcher> :/
[09:36:26] <padmatcher> It's strange, never had issues with .delay() in the past - I must be doing something really stupif
[09:37:29] <shoky> padmatcher: i dont see any delay() there, and you're doing weird stuff with your selectors
[09:38:05] <Tomashe> hey guys i have a question. i have a container with height 600px , inside it i want to put some div with height of 100px and i want that while im scrolling with mouse this element with move down and up with me untill it gets into the top of his container... so if its gets to the edges of the container and i keep scroll it wont
[09:38:06] <Tomashe> any ideas/
[09:38:38] <padmatcher> Yea I took out the delay because its not working
[09:39:18] <padmatcher> basically, I'm trying to make it so that when you click on an <a> ---- its child div slides out ----- and if a div is open, it closes first and then slides out the selected div
[09:40:18] <shoky> why $slider.toggle ?  why $selector.next().toggle ?
[09:40:26] <shoky> that toggles all of them
[09:40:27] <padmatcher> does that make sense <shoky> ?
[09:40:40] <shoky> padmatcher: your description makes sense, your code doesn't
[09:40:48] <padmatcher> oh, haha because I'm new to jquery and have NO idea what I'm doing
[09:40:50] <padmatcher> :D
[09:41:09] <shoky> padmatcher:  $selector and $slider  contain multiple elements
[09:41:33] <padmatcher> is that an issue? I couldnt figure out how to properly call the elements I wanted
[09:42:01] <shoky> it's an issue if you call $slider.toggle  which toggles multiple eleemtns, but you only wanted to toggle one
[09:42:06] <shoky> (for example..)
[09:42:06] <padmatcher> Ideally, I don't even want the div to be a parent of the <a> ---- I would like to have them seperate for css styling purposes
[09:42:23] <padmatcher> *child of the <a>
[09:42:34] <shoky> it's not a child of the <a>
[09:42:49] <padmatcher> sorry, <li>
[09:42:51] <shoky> i guess you meant child of the li
[09:43:43] <padmatcher> yepp
[09:45:00] <BillCriswell> How CSS was designed without variables in the first place blows my mind.
[09:45:01] <Lolist> li had kids?
[09:49:01] <padmatcher> <shoky> did you give up on me? :)
[09:50:13] <shoky> padmatcher kinda ;p
[09:50:45] <Lolist> padmuncher wat u want
[09:50:53] <padmatcher> lol alright then... I guess I gotta figure it out on my own
[09:50:55] <Lolist> i halp yu
[09:50:57] <padmatcher> thanks anyway shoky!
[09:51:11] <padmatcher> lolist! thanks!
[09:51:55] <padmatcher> here is my codepen http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Hnqea ----- Bare in mind its a mess, im new to jquery ---- basically, I'm trying to make it so that when you click on an <a> ---- its child div slides out ----- and if a div is open, it closes first and then slides out the selected div
[09:54:45] <Lolist> use .slide();
[09:55:07] <Lolist> and .click()
[09:57:32] <padmatcher> i do use .click() - I cant use .slide() because you cannot control the direction of it so I use .toggle with animation
[09:57:44] <padmatcher> I got that part figured out :)
[09:58:07] <gotwig> dblosevn: hey
[10:05:32] <jtm> hey everyone, I was wondering how would one go about adding to a serialized form? I have checkboxes and a select in one form and another form with just checkboxes. I serialize the form with just checkboxes but I want to add to that serialized string these checkboxes and select from the other form.
[10:06:15] <jtm> How would I go about this? I tried doing a .each across the checkboxes in the non-serialized form and did a serialization on each of them and concatenated them to the form seralize with a '&', but that didn't work.
[10:06:21] <jtm> So I am a bit lost what to do at this point.
[10:07:49] <omani_> can someone have a look at this please? http://paste.scsys.co.uk/233640?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[10:07:51] <veQue> i am in the process of researching other js libraries besides jquery.. should i continue or has jquery won this war?
[10:07:58] <omani_> I can't toggle systems management
[10:08:03] <omani_> when I click on it.
[10:08:10] <NoiseEee> veQue: i'd say it all depends on what your project needs?
[10:09:18] <veQue> there's somthing called extjs. ever use it?
[10:10:06] <NoiseEee> veQue: its closed source and for profit
[10:10:18] <veQue> oh well screw that one
[10:10:19] <NoiseEee> you'll need to pay to use it.
[10:10:22] <veQue> what about dojo?
[10:11:35] <puneet> How can I convert a black and white image to coloured using jquery
[10:11:47] <veQue> i'll just stick with jquery
[10:11:51] <puneet> I want this image conversion in a preloder
[10:11:51] <NoiseEee> i mean, you're in #jquery.  dojo is certainly a good library veQue, at this point maybe you should ask "why not jquery?" :)
[10:11:54] <veQue> why fix something that's not broke?
[10:12:21] <veQue> NoiseEee: yeh , i agree
[10:12:59] <veQue> i was just curious to get opinions on the others from a room that might've tried them out and had reasons for noo longer using them
[10:21:52] <omani_> can someone help me?
[10:21:58] <omani_> so many people. no answer yet.
[10:22:00] <omani_> can't be.
[10:22:18] <omani_> it's a simple toggling.
[10:22:41] <omani_> you all should be pros to do this. and I am sure you will know.
[10:22:43] <omani_> so come on guys.
[10:23:21] <omani_> see my paste above
[10:23:25] <Brodingo> omani_ calm down not everyone has irc open all the time
[10:23:40] <omani_> I know. I'm helping other people my self on other channels.
[10:23:55] <Brodingo> ok then expect accordingly, no?
[10:24:00] <omani_> yes.
[10:24:12] <Brodingo> youre missing a quote in your selector string
[10:24:15] <omani_> you seem to have time. would you help me please?
[10:24:21] <Brodingo> also you should include jquery code in a document ready function
[10:24:21] <omani_> which quote?
[10:24:41] <Brodingo> your first selector is missing an end quote
[10:25:15] <omani_> sec. I have a new code now.
[10:25:18] <omani_> changing all time.
[10:25:35] <Brodingo> also, collapse is not a jquery method
[10:26:50] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/233643?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[10:27:00] <amh345> i'm trying to figure out how to send the value of "this" in an $.ajax call.  i've tried data: {
[10:27:10] <amh345> "some_key": this}
[10:27:35] <amh345> but it throws an "Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation" error
[10:27:46] <shoky> amh345: what's in "this" ?
[10:27:48] <amh345> i've also tried context: this
[10:27:52] <amh345> hey shooky.
[10:27:55] <shoky> hey
[10:27:56] <omani_> andern: { data: $(this) }?
[10:28:05] <omani_> andern: { data: $(this.value) }?
[10:28:20] <shoky> omani_:  no
[10:28:56] <omani_> Brodingo: and?
[10:29:02] <omani_> new paste is ok?
[10:29:20] <amh345> "this"  should be what i've clicked on in my $('body').on("clicked",".some_class", function() {})
[10:29:44] <shoky> amh345:  well you can't expect to send a DOM element in an ajax request
[10:29:58] <amh345> ok. so i should attach it to a variable?
[10:30:05] <shoky> i don't know.. what do you want to send?
[10:30:24] <Brodingo> omani_ um well it seems completely different. youre not preventing default action anymore and the anchors dont have any children
[10:30:42] <amh345> i basically need to send the html element.
[10:30:56] <shoky> you dont send elements
[10:31:07] <omani_> Brodingo: I don't understand anything about what you're saying. I'm completely new to jquery.
[10:31:07] <shoky> maybe you want to send an html string?
[10:31:15] <omani_> but I understand the basics. and syntax.
[10:31:18] <omani_> I guess.
[10:31:23] <omani_> so what should I do
[10:31:37] <amh345> shoky, yes. the html string
[10:31:51] <shoky> ok, what html string exactly :P
[10:32:00] <shoky> the outer html of the clicked element?
[10:33:43] <shoky> that'd be  this.outerHTML  i guess.. seeing an example of what you want exactly would be best tho
[10:34:04] <Brodingo> omani_ we use jsfiddle.net in this channel a lot because you can actually create a demo of your code thats updatable
[10:34:08] <shoky> (and outerHTML was only added in firefox kinda recently)
[10:34:56] <omani_> ok I will use it
[10:35:12] <Brodingo> omani_ also if youre new to jquery you can check out try.jquery.com to hone your skills
[10:36:56] <feliperosa> Hey guys, I'm having some trouble with the maskedinput plugin (I think). The thing is, eventhough the masked input doesn't match the valid method of the form still gives me 'true'.
[10:37:26] <superdo> anyone can help? im trying to add content dynamically with ajax to a jqurey mobile page. I get the data from my rest server, but when I pass to a div, doesnt happen anything
[10:38:28] <Lolist> gaize
[10:38:30] <Lolist> i kant save
[10:38:33] <Lolist> \o/
[10:38:39] <Lolist> panic
[10:41:47] <omani_> Brodingo: It seems that jquery doesn't work at all here
[10:41:56] <omani_> no matter what I'm doing, it happens *nothing*
[10:42:09] <omani_> I would like to have at least a feedback whether or not I'm wrong.
[10:42:55] <Brodingo> omani_ well you have to make sure its configured correctly with the sidebar options and you can always use the console for debugging errors
[10:43:01] <omani_> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/233644?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[10:43:16] <omani_> no matter how I try to implement this. nothing works.
[10:43:32] <gotwig> is this channel logged?
[10:43:36] <omani_> and I hate it to waste time for a silly, simple, ultralight function.
[10:43:45] <ajpiano> gotwig: yes
[10:43:46] <omani_> at least conceptionally.
[10:43:54] <omani_> this toggle thing should work.
[10:44:22] <ajpiano> gotwig: http://irc.jquery.org
[10:44:23] <shoky> omani_: dont use javascript in the href tag like that
[10:44:38] <omani_> shoky: it's an example on the internet
[10:44:42] <shoky> omani_:  that will only work for calling global functions
[10:44:48] <shoky> omani_:  wow, on the internet?
[10:45:08] <omani_> can somebody show me a real working example please? I'm going crazy with this. 1 hour is too much time wasting for this method.
[10:46:19] <omani_> and I don't care if it does not work for next 2 hours. the less javascript, the better for me.
[10:46:26] <omani_> I began to hate this stuff.
[10:46:31] <gotwig> dblosevn: I accidently removed some code, lost some code
[10:46:37] <omani_> so what do you see if you look on this code? any hints?
[10:46:40] <shoky> of course you'll hate it if you just copy & paste examples from .. the internet
[10:46:40] <gotwig> dblosevn: do you got the past links that you sent to me ?
[10:46:43] <NoiseEee> omani_: an <a> takes you to a new document.
[10:46:44] <shoky> without bothering to learn
[10:46:46] <gotwig> dblosevn: do you got the links?
[10:46:47] <omani_> what can I do to get this *really easy* thing going?
[10:47:09] <NoiseEee> omani_: you want to prevent the default action of that
[10:47:17] <shoky> omani_:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/xfwUz/
[10:48:07] <omani_> see? this is what I mean. 5 lines of code. and I need 1 hour for this. obviously with help of others. I give up!
[10:48:13] <omani_> shoky: thanks anyway.
[10:48:37] <shoky> crybaby :)
[10:48:39] <Brodingo> omani_ theres a lot of good examples in the jquery docs
[10:48:48] <Brodingo> `api toggle
[10:48:48] <b-ot> Brodingo: .toggle(): Display or hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[10:48:54] <omani_> Brodingo: I have multiple tabs open on jquery docs
[10:48:59] <shoky> ?learn @ omani_
[10:48:59] <bot-t> omani_, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[10:49:06] <ajpiano> omani_: if you want to learn the basics and have some time to spare you might want to try the interactive course try.jquery.com
[10:50:36] <omani_> I have to learn javascript for jquery? oO
[10:50:39] <superdo> ok i solved :P
[10:50:43] <shoky> omani_: of course
[10:50:51] <shoky> jquery is nothing but a javascript library
[10:52:10] <omani_> shoky: what about preventing the "#slide" from showing at beginning?
[10:52:14] <omani_> or on page load.
[10:52:21] <omani_> something like e.preventDefault()?
[10:52:23] <shoky> display:none
[10:52:24] <shoky> CSS
[10:52:26] <omani_> oik
[10:52:27] <omani_> ok
[10:53:01] <omani_> but now it doesn't work with toggle
[10:53:12] <omani_> I have to change css display value when toggling.
[10:53:18] <omani_> at least that's what I guess.
[10:53:28] <shoky> omani_:  "but now" doesnt mean anything to us
[10:53:56] <Brodingo> omani_ toggle uses inline styles which will override a style sheet rule
[10:54:04] <shoky> omani_:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/xfwUz/1/
[10:55:10] <omani_> shoky: after setting display to "none"
[10:55:21] <shoky> omani_: check my fiddle
[10:55:34] <shoky> omani_:  and if you have a problem, link us to a fiddle
[10:55:50] <omani_> yes. I'm using inline style to set diplay to "none"
[10:55:56] <omani_> ok
[10:56:59] <omani_> http://jsfiddle.net/JdFs6/
[10:57:34] <omani_> so what about inline style in the first place. will it override them too?
[10:57:44] <shoky> you put it on a different element
[10:57:56] <omani_> oh
[10:57:57] <omani_> :/
[10:58:16] <omani_> yeeeeeeeees
[10:58:18] <omani_> now it works!
[10:58:22] <omani_> ababy this is amazing!
[10:58:22] <Lolist> \o/
[10:58:26] <Lolist> weeeepy
[10:58:35] <Lolist> weeeeheeeeee
[10:58:43] <omani_> ok after this I'm motivated again. I think I will learn javascript.
[10:58:46] <omani_> thank you so much guys.
[10:58:51] <shoky> sweet
[11:01:39] <omani_> I think I have to use ajax, if I want to set a href on the button that triggers the toggle and do a toggle both?
[11:02:04] <omani_> set the navbar static. so it is loaded once. in the moment I have to carry around the navbar in each html file.
[11:04:45] <Wolfed> Is it possible that a browser supports javascript but doesnt support ajax?
[11:05:10] <anew> no
[11:05:16] <Wolfed> Figured
[11:06:33] <shoky> it's possible
[11:06:45] <Wolfed> Really? How so?
[11:06:51] <shoky> just so...
[11:07:48] <Gho5t> very soey
[11:07:54] <shoky> IE3 for example (i think)
[11:08:12] <Wolfed> wow
[11:08:13] <Wolfed> lol
[11:08:48] <Wolfed> I meant it more as in a nowdays thing, with some people still using ie7 or what not... Didnt expect the 80's to get into the conversation :P
[11:09:34] <Wolfed> IE 5 started To support ajax
[11:10:16] <shoky> it also depends what you call "ajax"
[11:10:53] <Wolfed> xmlhttprequests
[11:13:49] <shoky> it's safe to use ;]
[11:17:40] <omani_> when I have "<li><a href="#" id="toggle">Systems Management</a></li>" and I toggle with id "toggle" how can I say that the <li> should then get a class added named "active"?
[11:18:07] <omani_> so it is "<li class="active"><a href="#" id="toggle">Systems Management</a></li>"?
[11:19:14] <omani_> ok got it.
[11:19:34] <jtal> I have an element called my.element[0].thing   I have tried several combinations of escaping but cant get it to match... e.g. $("my\.element\\[0\\]\.thing")
[11:20:06] <omani_> man look at this genius. I thought if there is a method called "children" then there is a method called "parent" and so I said: "$(this).parent('li').addClass('active');" and it works.
[11:20:50] <jtal> anyone know how I have to pass this selector to jquery?
[11:25:58] <Jester86> jtal what's up?
[11:30:42] <jtal> Jester86: I'm an idiot. Thats whats up.
[11:32:42] <Jester86> oh, ok lol
[11:36:05] <tony123> what up homies
[11:38:16] <gotwig> tony123: Lost all my code due to fucking failure of online IDE
[11:38:44] <gotwig> shiftedit.net
[11:38:47] <gotwig> ...
[11:38:55] <jtal> what online IDE?
[11:39:17] <gotwig> jtal: ^
[11:39:42] <tony123> could someone help me troubleshoot a script? Im having a hell of a time with it...
[11:40:04] <jtal> looks interesting, but scary
[11:43:14] <omani_> I have this now to set active of clicked links. but as the page loads the active state is loss. http://paste.scsys.co.uk/233666?ln=on&hl=on&submit=Format+it!
[11:43:32] <omani_> how can I put <li> on active persistently
[11:45:27] <omani_> I guess this is not possible
[11:45:52] <omani_> because when the page loads, everything I do will be overwritten by the new content of the site
[11:48:23] <shoky> tony123: ask
[11:55:20] <tony123> yo yo
[12:01:45] <Tomashe> hey guys i saw in some website that while u scroll more products are apearing
[12:02:01] <Tomashe> something like ajax post that show more products or something i have no idea
[12:02:06] <Tomashe> can anyone ever did that?
[12:02:18] <NoiseEee> Tomashe: google "lazy loading javascript"
[12:02:40] <Tomashe> hmm
[12:03:47] <Tomashe> sounds like nice one
[12:03:50] <Tomashe> i will check it out
[12:03:51] <Tomashe> thanks mate
[12:07:07] <jtm> Why isn't this working: $serializedForm.replace("/post_form/g", "filter_form");
[12:07:37] <jtm> It's not replacing anything
[12:07:40] <sacho> that's not how you specify regular expressions
[12:07:55] <sacho> try without the quotes
[12:07:59] <jtm> oh without quotes
[12:07:59] <jtm> ok
[12:08:37] <recurse> I'm in the process of trying to convert old ajax() functions (i believe from prototype). im trying to determine the appropriate solution. here is an example of the old ajax() function and two options. which one is the more appropriate for this case? http://pastebin.com/ycANJBgJ
[12:10:48] <leb> can anyone help with jq knob UI?
[12:11:26] <djQuery> ?ask@leb
[12:11:33] <buzzsaw> that depedns on the question leb...
[12:11:55] <leb> Have been using the jq knob/dial "widget"
[12:12:01] <leb> doesn't do all I want
[12:12:12] <leb> considering rolling my own
[12:12:31] <leb> the one I am using is an <input>
[12:12:44] <leb> but I just want to use it as a guage
[12:12:51] <leb> don't care about input
[12:13:05] <leb> if I write a new one from, scratch
[12:13:17] <recurse> (any insight on my issue guys?)
[12:13:32] <djQuery> leb, well you should be able to just disable the input but there are plenty of guages out there as well
[12:13:39] <ravenzz> recurse what is your issue about?
[12:13:41] <leb> what are my options for what kind of html object to base it on if any?
[12:13:56] <recurse> well, i hate to sound like an echo but here goes:
[12:13:58] <recurse> I'm in the process of trying to convert old ajax() functions (i believe from prototype). im trying to determine the appropriate solution. here is an example of the old ajax() function and two options. which one is the more appropriate for this case? http://pastebin.com/ycANJBgJ
[12:14:20] <leb> sure I can disable the input
[12:14:24] <leb> it has an option for that
[12:14:24] <djQuery> leb, <meter min="0" max="10">2 out of 10</meter>
[12:15:17] <leb> ok my lack of depth for html is going to show now
[12:15:38] <djQuery> leb, <meter> is a new html5 element
[12:15:50] <leb> ahh
[12:16:42] <leb> does that imply limited backwards compatibility? I could be Ok with that, just asking.
[12:17:01] <leb> that's browser compat I meant
[12:17:14] <djQuery> leb, yeah you have to use a shim for backward compatability
[12:17:15] <recurse> ravenzz: any tips?
[12:17:25] <ravenzz> recurse 1 sec
[12:18:48] <recurse> ok no worries, take your time. I appreciate it.
[12:20:01] <djQuery> leb, http://caniuse.com/#feat=progressmeter
[12:22:14] <djQuery> recurse, instead of that feeds.join you might want to think about using serialzeArray
[12:22:18] <Tomashe> looks like this lazy plugin have a limit imges he can handle
[12:22:23] <Tomashe> anyone experiance that?
[12:22:37] <ravenzz> recurse url: "stats_feed.xml.php?'+feeds.join('&')" <- this is wrong
[12:22:57] <recurse> perhaps i should give the other parts of the function for more depth
[12:23:02] <recurse>  var feeds=new Array();
[12:23:12] <recurse>   for (var f in lst) feeds[feeds.length]=f+'='+(lst[f].join?lst[f].join(','):lst[f]);
[12:23:14] <recurse>   if (!feeds.length) return;
[12:23:21] <recurse> thats pretty much it ...
[12:23:29] <ravenzz> recurse use a pastebin
[12:23:35] <leb> some more on jq knob
[12:23:35] <recurse> aye sorry
[12:23:52] <ravenzz> use array literals btw
[12:23:59] <ravenzz> var feeds = [];
[12:24:24] <leb> nevermind
[12:24:29] <ravenzz> ?ajax @ recurse
[12:24:29] <bot-t> recurse, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:24:31] <recurse> (yea this hasnt been touched for years this code ... hence the conversion - im sure there are plenty of things wrong with this ravenzz )
[12:25:02] <ravenzz> basically you can/should read the docs, and then you can decide
[12:26:44] <recurse> well, if it counts for anything, ive been immersed in the docs. its just im new to jquery so its a bit of a curve for me.
[12:26:46] <recurse> http://pastebin.com/JtW2yY8w
[12:26:57] <recurse> thats the full function with function i call onsuccess
[12:28:17] <boytoy> http://jsfiddle.net/jUWk2/ -- made this supersimple lightbox that closes when you click anywhere but the lightbox - but how come it only works the first time I open/close it?
[12:28:48] <djQuery> boytoy, its workin for me
[12:29:03] <Tomashe> when i run jquery lazy load with arround 1400 images on page , its not working and no error but the wierd is that firebug "cunsole" shows "Reload to activate window console"
[12:29:14] <boytoy> djQuery: yep, but if you open/close it, then open it again, it'll close even though you click on the lightbox itself
[12:29:31] <boytoy> djQuery: it should only close when clicking elsewhere (and this works the first time)
[12:29:45] <djQuery> hmmmm see that
[12:30:11] <recurse> you click event is on your entire html / document
[12:30:14] <boytoy> i reckon i need to move my last two functions inside the myTrigger.yabox somehow?
[12:30:19] <recurse> $("html").click(function () {
[12:30:20] <ravenzz> recurse anyway you should watch this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXjVFPosQHw when you have time... one of the points is about a libraries indipendend javascript application... I immediately thought at it when you mentioned that you are converting from prototype to jQuery
[12:30:26] <boytoy> hmm
[12:30:39] <recurse> ravenzz: cheers, ill surely watch it
[12:30:48] <djQuery> boytoy, did you make yabox
[12:30:51] <recurse> ravenzz: by the way im shooting for comlpete elimination of ptotoype
[12:30:56] <boytoy> djQuery: lul no
[12:31:28] <recurse> boytoy, perhaps your click even should be attached to something like a close icon or href
[12:31:43] <recurse> $("#someSillySelector").click(function ()
[12:31:45] <djQuery> ?outsideevents@boytoy
[12:31:47] <bot-t> boytoy, outside events - jQuery Plugin Registry - With jQuery outside events you can bind to an event that will be triggered only when a specific originating event occurs outside the element in question. For example, you can click outside, doubl... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ba-jquery-outside-events-plugin
[12:32:31] <boytoy> but what i have works the first time i open/close.. why wont it work the 2nd time?
[12:32:48] <recurse> dont try to explain magic
[12:32:51] <recurse> =)~
[12:32:59] <boytoy> :-)
[12:34:39] <boytoy> yo pachet got a sec?
[12:34:59] <pachet> sure what's up
[12:35:02] <boytoy> kewl
[12:35:08] <pachet> recurse: magic is simple you just have to have enough lands for your kavu
[12:35:22] <djQuery> boytoy, you do relise that it has a hideonclick option
[12:35:32] <boytoy> pachet: http://jsfiddle.net/jUWk2/ -- using this supersimple lightbox that I made to close whenever you click outside the lightbox itself. But how come it only works the first time I open/close it?
[12:35:57] <boytoy> djQuery: Yeah but i dont want it to hide when i click on the lightbox (cuz its gonna contain forms 'n stuff)
[12:36:05] <djQuery> not very well documented
[12:36:20] <pachet> my connection is kind of yucky right now, waiting on jsfiddle to trickle through my ethernet cable
[12:36:28] <pachet> i'm holding it upright and shaking to expedite this
[12:36:37] <boytoy> he he :-)
[12:36:38] <recurse> ravenzz: so what would it take to recruit someone, preferably with a jquery badass, to help me convert a few  protoype (with a mix of other non-jquery libs i plan on converting to jquery UI / like tabs) screens?
[12:36:54] <recurse> preferably a jquery*
[12:37:18] <pachet> recurse: money
[12:37:41] <ravenzz> recurse I'd do this http://pastie.org/6396404
[12:38:30] <recurse> i see
[12:39:02] <recurse> so you used a success: instead of a done function
[12:39:13] <recurse> i see now
[12:39:17] <recurse> interesting
[12:40:22] <ravenzz> or $.get('stats_feed.xml.php?' + feeds.join('&'), statsFeed);
[12:40:28] <ravenzz> maybe?
[12:40:42] <Lolist> hay
[12:40:47] <Lolist> u foolz
[12:40:51] <Lolist> dafuq
[12:41:19] <Lolist> y u no jquery?
[12:41:19] <b-ot> Lolist: ('')
[12:41:28] <djQuery> boytoy, http://jsfiddle.net/jUWk2/1/     your click is being unbound at some point
[12:42:25] <boytoy> hmmmmmmmmmmm
[12:42:49] <djQuery> boytoy, open the console and you will see it
[12:44:34] <djQuery> boytoy, here lets try something completly different

[12:48:49] <recurse> jquery guru's apply within .....
[12:49:08] <djQuery> boytoy, they  seem to be doing e.stopPropogation inside the overlay in the plugin so that wont work
[12:49:50] <boytoy> ah i see
[12:50:01] <boytoy> so http://jsfiddle.net/jUWk2/3/ is not the way to go?
[12:50:20] <boytoy> doesnt work so..
[12:52:32] <djQuery> boytoy, have you looked at http://bebraw.github.com/yabox.js/javascripts/demo.js
[12:53:10] <boytoy> yes..
[12:59:00] <boytoy> djQuery: anyway thanks so far, gotta run out real quick
[13:01:53] <shaunm> Is there anyone around who works on the jquery documentation?
[13:03:36] <BostonMA1776> I am using .index() are there any problems in ie8 I am trying to debug an error.
[13:03:44] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know of a nice way to calculate the width of a letter?
[13:04:01] <jeffreylevesque> clientWidth?
[13:04:26] <NoiseEee> the width of a letter... seems icky.
[13:05:25] <jeffreylevesque> i have a responsive thing I'm making depending on breakpoints
[13:05:38] <jeffreylevesque> trying to assess if I can replace the concept of my breakpoints
[13:05:46] <jeffreylevesque> with width of all the text
[13:06:37] <Ahiru> Hello
[13:06:49] <NoiseEee> jeffreylevesque: afaik, that would be the wrong path to go down.
[13:07:08] <jeffreylevesque> and why's that?
[13:07:28] <NoiseEee> personal zoom preferences etc?
[13:07:57] <jeffreylevesque> i have a $(window).resize() condition
[13:08:10] <NoiseEee> browser/OS zoom preferences, i'm not sure how that affects your calcs... but anytime you're trying to figure out the width of a character or text is *usually* indicative of the wrong approach
[13:08:13] <Ahiru> I'm in need of some wysiwyg software or similar which works on html, applying jquery effects using features similar of dreamworks, per example
[13:09:49] <ZeroBeholder> Ahiru: dreamweaver? have you looked at eclipse? There may be a GUI plugin for eclipse...
[13:10:36] <ibc> hi, a basci question: if my web dynamicall loads a JS file (I mean after the web is already loaded and working) and such a JS file contains $(document)ready (CODE), would CODE be executed?
[13:10:52] <Ahiru> ZeroBeholder, no, I didn't
[13:11:18] <ZeroBeholder> Ahiru: http://www.myeclipseide.com/htmlpages-func-display-pid-12.html
[13:11:42] <ZeroBeholder> Ahiru: I googled: eclipse webdev gui
[13:12:05] <Ahiru> ZeroBeholder: ok
[13:12:47] <NoiseEee> ibc: no.
[13:13:19] <ZeroBeholder> Ahiru: I do most of my stuff via text because that is the way I have been doing it-- I cannot really recommend or say one thing or the other for any WYSIWYG Eclipse plugins, but Eclipse is free to use and has a lot of plugins. It has it's caveats too. It is just one possible way to go.
[13:13:19] <NoiseEee> ibc: you'd have to call the code/function that the 'onready' has
[13:13:49] <Ahiru> ZeroBeholder: I see
[13:14:34] <ibc> ok, thanks a lot
[13:14:53] <ZeroBeholder> Ahiru: I have a client using "Rackforms". It is a mess, but it does work reliably for tenantmagic.net...
[13:15:18] <Ahiru> lol
[13:15:24] <Ahiru> that's cool
[13:15:31] <ZeroBeholder> Ahiru: http://www.rackforms.com/
[13:16:44] <Ahiru> ZeroBeholder: hmm interesting
[13:17:01] <ZeroBeholder> Ahiru: Again, exercise your own judgment on the solutions presented by me or others. Ultimately it is up to you to decide what is or isn't appropriate for your project.
[13:17:50] <Ahiru> ZeroBeholder: I think jquery as an animation resource for web, but it can be something more?
[13:19:46] <ZeroBeholder> Ahiru: Sure I use it to do AJAX. That allows me to not redirect the user while I am interacting with my server. It is also a great way to reduce the time it takes to have multi-browser compatible javascript. I use it to move a lot of data in and out of pages while the user is unaware anything is happening.
[13:20:19] <ZeroBeholder> Ahiru: It is out of order, but each statement is true...
[13:20:46] <Ahiru> lol
[13:20:58] <ZeroBeholder> Ahiru: It is like a grammar school homework assignment where you have to rearrange the sentences. Put the main idea first...
[13:21:22] <Ahiru> ZeroBeholder: that sounds awesome, an example could be the autocompletion tool Google uses when you type?
[13:21:39] <ZeroBeholder> Yes, that is it exactly.
[13:21:42] <Ahiru> :D
[13:21:58] <Ahiru> I'm getting more interested on this area hehe
[13:22:22] <Ahiru> ZeroBeholder: how much experience do you have on jquery?
[13:22:48] <ZeroBeholder> Plenty. Not enough though.
[13:23:48] <ZeroBeholder> Speaking of which, just starting to use jQuery validator. Anyone have a 'favorite' link in their bookmarks. Google has been bountiful, but not returning the result which makes the sun shine and birds sing for me...
[13:25:00] <Ahiru> lol
[13:25:29] <BostonMA1776> Why when I do .index('img') it returns 1 for the first element instead of 0? Is this normal? I am considering subtracting one to fix it but IDK if something is going wrong.
[13:25:53] <ZeroBeholder> Ahiru: In the words of Plato, I know nothing.
[13:26:07] <Lolist> i kno it
[13:26:24] <Lolist> hau may i halp yu
[13:26:48] <ZeroBeholder> BostonMA1776: img in your array is not the first element.
[13:27:18] <BostonMA1776> ZeroBeholder: Okay. Is that normal?
[13:27:29] <Ahiru> ZeroBeholder: lol ok
[13:27:32] <ZeroBeholder> BostonMA1776: The numeric order may not be what you think it is.
[13:27:47] <NoiseEee> BostonMA1776: missing the rest of your snippet
[13:28:03] <basiclaser> hey guys, can you give some examples of good quality lightweight notebook laptops? low end, i basically just want a computer to run some text editors and browsers, light web design. This macbook pro is a wasted investment, i need to get rid of it :D
[13:28:12] <Ahiru> ZeroBeholder: how much time are you on jquery field?
[13:28:13] <BostonMA1776> IDK what to post. but I will use your suggestion ZeroBeholder
[13:28:43] <ZeroBeholder> BostonMA1776: echo array[0], it will show you what is at array index 0
[13:28:58] <BostonMA1776> ZeroBeholder: Thanks
[13:29:02] <ZeroBeholder> BostonMA1776: Not echo, but...
[13:30:22] <ZeroBeholder> basiclaser: I have an i7 ThinkPad E530 and it isn't too heavy but was only $700. Maybe less now that they are getting older.
[13:31:38] <ZeroBeholder> basiclaser: I am in the wrong tab for that answer, as you are for the question. Sorry, people, I am flipping between a lot of tabs.
[13:32:15] <basiclaser> hhuuuuhh?
[13:32:25] <basiclaser> its jquery related :D
[13:32:38] <Ahiru> lol :P
[13:32:43] <basiclaser> and thanks im looking at that laptop now
[13:32:50] <Ahiru> be careful Zero :D

[13:35:25] <Ahiru> ZeroBeholder: where did/do you learn the jquery you know now?
[13:36:02] <BostonMA1776> I am new to index() Is there a way I can view everything in the index? I would like to know the first element because I have an error where it skips over the first element.
[13:36:36] <NoiseEee> BostonMA1776: pastebin an example of how you're using it and what you want to achieve.
[13:39:44] <BostonMA1776> The example would not be useful. I just want to know basically what index() searches when I select an id
[13:41:11] <SenorNaddy> I'm trying to assign a click event to an a tag that has href set, however I don't want to follow the href location, however when using the following code http://jsfiddle.net/A7ZnV/ the function for the click event is never executed, am I missing something obvious?
[13:42:22] <sedeki> I want to fade out a tag, any hints on how to do this?
[13:43:30] <Tomashe> anyone have any idea how to debug lazy load on alot of pictures firebug just not working
[13:43:40] <Tomashe> i have arround 1450 images on a pagae :/
[13:45:11] <NoiseEee> Tomashe: the point behind lazy loading is loading some of them at a time.
[13:45:41] <andrew9184> SenorNaddy: http://jsfiddle.net/A7ZnV/2/
[13:46:14] <Tomashe> yes i know
[13:46:23] <Tomashe> but it just show eveyrthing as grey pictures
[13:46:25] <gotwig> Ok
[13:46:27] <Tomashe> and its not reponding
[13:46:29] <andrew9184> sedeki: what do you mean ?
[13:46:34] <gotwig> in javascript window prompt you cant make a password dialog box, can you?
[13:46:45] <Tomashe> none of the images is visible no matter whta i do, scroll or anything else
[13:46:48] <gotwig> how is it in jQuery UI?
[13:47:20] <andrew9184> its a modal in jquery ui
[13:47:27] <andrew9184> native javascript prompt doesnt have it, i dont think
[13:47:43] <sedeki> andrew9184 i want to make a <section>'s visibility go from 100% visibility to 0%
[13:47:51] <NoiseEee> well Tomashe try debugging, a la http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[13:48:06] <andrew9184> sedeki: adjust the opacity, or rgba
[13:48:14] <sedeki> how do I animate it?
[13:48:20] <andrew9184> $.animate
[13:48:24] <sedeki> thnaks
[13:48:25] <ThoMe> hiho
[13:48:35] <Tomashe> hmm
[13:48:54] <ThoMe> is it posible to select all entries in a select-box (multiselect-box)
[13:48:54] <ThoMe> ?
[13:50:10] <andrew9184> $("select").children() ?
[13:52:05] <gotwig> andrew9184: do you have some examples for me?
[13:52:06] <veQue> http://coffitivity.com/ just out of plain curiosity i am not working on this site.. what would be the simple fix for the player at the top to be the same in both ff and chrome?
[13:52:18] <gotwig> andrew9184: jQuery prompt with password, and nice look maybe...
[13:52:36] <s3b`> http://jsfiddle.net/EyFSS/
[13:52:37] <veQue> in ff i can only mute unmute not adjust the slider for volume
[13:52:37] <s3b`> ?!
[13:52:42] <s3b`> It worked yesterday and now it doesn't
[13:52:51] <andrew9184> veQue: html5 ?
[13:52:57] <s3b`> "sayHello is not a function"
[13:53:02] <veQue> yes
[13:53:32] <gotwig> loool
[13:53:51] <ThoMe> andrew9184: i think i mean
[13:53:52] <ThoMe> $('#clients option').prop('selected', 'selected');
[13:53:54] <ThoMe> or ?
[13:54:11] <andrew9184> i think theres a :selected css filter
[13:54:38] <djQuery> ThoMe, $('#clients').children(':selected')
[13:55:17] <sedeki> how do I empty a container?
[13:55:29] <andrew9184> sedeki: read jQuery docs
[13:55:44] <djQuery> $('container').html('');
[13:57:37] <sedeki> I have var myImg = new Image(); myImg.src = 'blah blah';, can I add this to the DOM?
[13:57:50] <djQuery> yes
[13:57:54] <andrew9184> s3b`: http://jsfiddle.net/EyFSS/1/
[13:58:12] <s3b`> andrew9184 yeah I just did it that way and got it
[13:58:17] <sedeki> $('#content').add(loaderImg); won't do it
[13:58:18] <s3b`> for some reason, last night this way didn't work and the other way did
[13:58:37] <djQuery> ?append@sedeki
[13:58:37] <bot-t> sedeki, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[13:59:01] <ThoMe> djQuery: $('#clients').children(':selected'); doesnet works
[13:59:17] <djQuery> ThoMe, see ?demo
[13:59:17] <bot-t> ThoMe, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:59:22] <ThoMe> djQuery: no error. nothing
[14:00:46] <ThoMe> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/sZzws/
[14:00:56] <ThoMe> djQuery: first colum (alle)

[14:01:48] <ThoMe> now.
[14:02:11] <andrew9184> what are you expecting it to do
[14:02:20] <andrew9184> you dont do anything with the selection
[14:02:28] <andrew9184> you can call the selected children
[14:03:39] <ThoMe> andrew9184: $('select#clients > option').prop('selected', 'selected');
[14:03:41] <ThoMe> its better or?
[14:04:02] <djQuery> ThoMe, well you arent doing anyting with them
[14:04:26] <dblosevn>  $('#clients > option').prop('selected', 'selected');
[14:04:46] <ThoMe> dblosevn: hm. ok :)
[14:04:53] <dblosevn> ids can only be used once on a page select#id is redunant
[14:06:17] <djQuery> ThoMe,  http://jsfiddle.net/sZzws/2/
[14:07:18] <ThoMe> djQuery: emm.yes?
[14:08:47] <ldr> hello
[14:08:52] <ldr> can u help me with this one
[14:09:00] <ldr> I have range datepicker
[14:09:11] <ldr> which behaves so weird
[14:15:52] <ldr> It's working fine in jsfiddle
[14:15:53] <ldr> http://jsfiddle.net/L2XZ8/
[14:16:02] <Armistice> http://jsfiddle.net/6kqts/2/ On line 9 I am tryin to detect whether the end of the ul has been reached... however it isn't doing it's job. It keeps continuing regardless.
[14:16:17] <ldr> is it because I need to make it 'live'?
[14:16:22] <ldr> I'm really stuck
[14:17:18] <Armistice> I'm not sure what your issue is ldr but it could be depending on your jquery version
[14:18:48] <ldr> 1.8.3
[14:19:50] <BostonMA1776> I want to select the ul from a class is this correct? var x = $(".y".ul);
[14:20:18] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: Not anywhere close.
[14:20:42] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: Your would do the same thing as with CSS
[14:20:59] <BostonMA1776> So I have to give the ul an ID?
[14:21:40] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: Only if you want
[14:22:08] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: $("ul.y") would select all <ul class="y"></ul
[14:22:13] <systemfault> >
[14:22:44] <BostonMA1776> okay I will try this. Thanks
[14:22:56] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: If the <ul> is the only element with the y class then you can simply do $('.y')
[14:32:52] <vacho> I am using twitter bootstrap's "Button dropdown menus", when I click on it it triggers search, anyone know why?
[14:33:12] <fonko> guys im going insane... i hae been like 4 hours trying to custom a jquery json paginate plug in
[14:33:24] <fonko> any easy way to paginate json data?
[14:34:21] <fonko> my problem is that i have a form that adds info then each time i add a record i need to paginate on the fly (ajax)
[14:37:00] <Tomashe> anyone knows a good responsive sliding gallery .. something like colorbox but more like touchtouch
[14:37:01] <Tomashe> ?
[14:38:16] <andrew9184> fonko: why isnt it working ?
[14:38:28] <andrew9184> vacho: you probably need .dropdown-toggle
[14:38:33] <andrew9184> theres a bootstrap channel
[14:41:11] <ThoMe> andrew9184: emm
[14:41:32] <ThoMe> andrew9184: is it posible when i click of button 1 and make $('#produkte > option').prop('selected', 'selected');
[14:41:42] <ThoMe> then i click two times and all unselected?
[14:41:51] <andrew9184> yes, but why not have two buttons ?
[14:41:56] <ThoMe> now i have $('#alleProdukteAuswaehlen').click( function() {
[14:42:07] <ThoMe> andrew9184: hm. i dont know. is nice with one :-)
[14:42:25] <fonko> because it uses some weird callbacks, i can't fully understand
[14:42:58] <fonko> so when i add new data it shows the new data but after two times the pagination just goes away! (the buttons )
[14:47:18] <ldr> hello
[14:47:32] <ldr> the dates are still acting weird
[14:48:32] <BostonMA1776> What do you call the 'thing' jquery returns when you from $(class)
[14:48:40] <BostonMA1776> *run not from
[14:49:14] <Eviltwin> It's called a jQuery object or jQuery collection
[14:49:26] <BostonMA1776> Thanks that is what I was wondering.
[14:50:53] <coldhead> i like to call it a "jQuery wrapped set"
[14:51:04] <coldhead> which i think i got from jQuery: Novice to Ninja
[14:51:13] <solarflares> i like to call it a jQuery condom
[14:51:18] <coldhead> although that book had so little to do with ninjitsu >: |
[14:51:24] <coldhead> false advertising
[14:51:35] <solarflares> same thing happened to me with php+mysql: novice to ninja
[14:51:48] <solarflares> I still can't disappear with smoke which is why i bought the book
[14:51:53] <BostonMA1776> I just want a term where everyone will understand me. Do you think Jquery condom would be pretty much understood by everyone?
[14:52:52] <solarflares> people in ##javascript might respond to it
[14:53:16] <BostonMA1776> j/k I think I will stick with Jquery object. Sounds official
[14:53:25] <solarflares> mostly because I'm certain the word jQuery alerts everyone from their slumber and incites rage
[14:54:58] <solarflares> still not 100 percent on the divide between those who use jQuery and those who don't
[14:55:53] <BostonMA1776> I thought jQuery was respected?
[14:56:52] <andrew9184> some people overuse jQuery and don't understand the functions
[14:57:12] <systemfault> jQuery is fine and respected..
[14:57:28] <systemfault> Blame the programmer, not the tool
[14:57:34] <ThoMe> mm
[14:57:42] <ThoMe> when i use $('.clientInformationenLaden').attr('disabled', 'disabled'); for disable a button after the post
[14:57:46] <ThoMe> then i cant post anything
[14:57:47] <solarflares> really because I've had my head almost torn off just for bringing it up in javascript
[14:57:54] <ThoMe> how i can ONLY disable the button after submut?
[15:00:05] <ThoMe> when i use attr('disabled', 'disabled'); then post all my input fields
[15:00:11] <ThoMe> but not the button values
[15:01:11] <BostonMA1776> I have no idea why newbs would use jQuery I find plain Javascript easier
[15:01:54] <chilversc> BostonMA1776: because jquery provides combatibility shims for different browsers, and a css selector engine for browser that do not have it
[15:02:22] <BostonMA1776> Oh okay interesting features.
[15:04:29] <BostonMA1776> I hate using the library computer to program the mouse is so small. I feel like I am going to get carpel tunnel. DX
[15:04:48] <systemfault> I know both pure DOM and jQuery and jQuery is a lot easier
[15:05:27] <BostonMA1776> I just find the Jquery manual hard to understand compared to w3schools I guess.
[15:06:22] <systemfault> :/
[15:06:42] <systemfault> w3school is renowned for giving false information...
[15:07:28] <BostonMA1776> I didn't know that.
[15:07:32] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: jQuery is easy You have a function named $ and you pass a CSS selector to it to get DOM Nodess
[15:07:48] <systemfault> Then you apply functions to the collection of DOM Nodes returned
[15:08:15] <BostonMA1776> Yeah I just think it is hard to debug.
[15:08:21] <Tomashe> it slooks like .on isnt working like live
[15:08:24] <Tomashe> its not live at all
[15:08:27] <BostonMA1776> Are there any debugging tips?
[15:08:29] <Tomashe> any solution?
[15:08:31] <systemfault> Tomashe: .on has two syntaxes
[15:08:44] <solarflares> console.log is my debugging tip
[15:08:46] <Tomashe> .on("click",function() {..
[15:08:58] <Tomashe> should act like live if i read it correctly
[15:08:58] <systemfault> Tomashe: 1) element.on(eventType, handler) 2) parentElement.on(eventType, selector, handler)
[15:09:04] <systemfault> Tomashe: 2) acts like .live
[15:09:12] <Tomashe> hmm
[15:09:25] <systemfault> Tomashe: $(document).on('click', 'a', function() {});
[15:09:30] <Tomashe> why
[15:09:38] <coldhead> why is a mouse when it spins
[15:09:45] <Tomashe> why not just .on(eventType, handler)
[15:09:52] <Tomashe> why need the selector inside the element
[15:10:03] <systemfault> Tomashe: Because of the limitations of the DOM.
[15:10:14] <Tomashe> hmm
[15:10:19] <systemfault> Tomashe: When you use 1) the handler is attached to the element itself
[15:10:54] <BostonMA1776> Has anyone ever used the .index() function before. For some reason when I run that on the 0th child of a jquery object it returns 1 instead of 0. I have checked the children and it is indeed the 0'th child.
[15:10:56] <Tomashe> ok thanks
[15:11:01] <systemfault> Tomashe: When you use 2), it attaches the handler to a parent, not the element and bubbling is used to get and handler the events
[15:11:42] <coldhead> Tomashe: read the section on Event Delegation here: http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/events
[15:11:47] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: .index() is to get the index of the children at the depth where the element is
[15:12:06] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: If you want an element in a jquery object, you want .eq(index)
[15:13:37] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: A page's DOM is a tree structure (In case you have a CS background)
[15:13:46] <BostonMA1776> systemfault: That is what I want. I just want to know if it starts at one or 0.
[15:14:23] <systemfault> BostonMA1776: It's zero-based
[15:14:30] <BostonMA1776> systemfault: I am getting a one off error but I am shocked because it doesnt seem like I should be getting it. I could subtract one. But I don't want to do that if I am doing something wrong.
[15:19:15] <lampe2> hey i got a problem with a sortable list. when the list is empty at the beginnig and i drag a draggable item into the sortable list i cant sort the items! but when i allready have a item in the sortable list then the sortable list works correctly can someone help?
[15:20:33] <Antonis> hello, I have a qustion. If I use multiple selectors, can I use something similar to $(this) to work with both?
[15:20:47] <systemfault> Antonis: ?
[15:20:53] <Antonis> let me demonstrate
[15:21:13] <Antonis> $("rect#bedroom,rect#bedroom-door").mouseover( function(){ $(this).css("fill","#4A8BF6"); });
[15:21:57] <Antonis> $(this) in this case will change the color of either selector but not both..
[15:22:21] <Antonis> instead of defining once again $("rect#bedroom,rect#bedroom-door").css.... I would like to know if there is something similar to $(this)
[15:22:32] <systemfault> Did you even try?
[15:22:55] <systemfault> Of course, $(this) will be the hovered element and not both..
[15:23:33] <Antonis> I know that's why I am asking if there is an identifier or whatever it is called to work for both at the same time
[15:24:10] <Antonis> anyway I will just define both...
[15:24:11] <systemfault> Antonis: Then store the result of the selection in a variable
[15:24:22] <Antonis> hm..
[15:24:33] <Antonis> let me try
[15:24:38] <systemfault> var selectedNodes = $("rect#bedroom,rect#bedroom-door"); selectedNodes.mouseover( function(){ selectedNodes.css("fill","#4A8BF6"); });
[15:25:37] <Antonis> yeah worked thanks!!
[15:26:05] <systemfault> You're welcome :D

[15:42:23] <David_Bradbury> Is there a shorter or cleaner looking way for getting the node of a selector outside of using [0] or .first()? (For example, $("#foo")[0])
[15:44:20] <systemfault> David_Bradbury: A dom node or a wrapped one?
[15:44:30] <David_Bradbury> A DOM node
[15:44:32] <systemfault> .get(0) = DOM Node
[15:46:01] <David_Bradbury> Hmm. I guess the reason I don't like specifying an index is because if it is only for an ID, then there should only be one object found, thus being redundant
[15:46:19] <David_Bradbury> .get(0) feels like [0] to me (I'm being picky and it isn't important, but I was just curious)
[15:47:38] <systemfault> David_Bradbury: I rarely need to unwrap my DOM nodes
[15:48:01] <David_Bradbury> I need to somewhat frequently

[15:53:33] <Iarfen> Hi!
[15:53:39] <fonko> anyone knows why the heck this is losing the pagination links after the second data input?
[15:53:43] <fonko> http://www.picafotografia.com/prueba/
[15:53:48] <Iarfen> I need to delete elements from a selection (but not from the DOM), how I do it?
[15:54:52] <Tomashe> how do i using javascript , strip this string "left: 1300%" into 1300 only
[15:55:02] <Tomashe> sometimes ir could be 120
[15:55:04] <Tomashe> and so on..
[15:55:09] <Tomashe> but i need the number only
[15:56:59] <coldhead> ?eval parseInt('1300%')
[15:57:01] <bot-t> coldhead: 1300
[15:57:16] <Tomashe> hmm
[15:57:18] <Tomashe> nice
[15:57:19] <coldhead> ?eval parseInt('120% aids aids aids')
[15:57:19] <bot-t> coldhead: 120
[15:58:51] <Tomashe> thanks
[16:03:22] * coldhead np: godspeed you! black emperor - mladic
[16:05:38] <boytoy> coldhead: kewl
[16:05:45] <boytoy> that aint black emperor the rapper though is it?
[16:06:08] <coldhead> nope
[16:06:19] <coldhead> middle aged canadians with guitars and violins
[16:06:32] <boytoy> that'd be last emperor sorry
[16:06:37] <boytoy> cool
[16:07:00] <boytoy> yeah listening to it now, pretty laid back, will keep it playing in the background :P
[16:07:23] <coldhead> it's good for debugging other people's broken code, as it turns out :)
[16:07:29] <boytoy> hehe
[16:07:33] <boytoy> nice
[16:07:52] <boytoy> not like last emperor's black magic album
[16:08:03] <boytoy> my friend was institutionalized after listening to it too much
[16:08:27] <boytoy> he also had a big bad of weed, dunno which were responsible, probably both
[16:08:54] <coldhead> that sounds irresponsible
[16:09:06] <coldhead> but at least it got him off the streets
[16:09:11] <boytoy> it was crazy
[16:09:20] <jrajav> If you're institutionalized from listening to music you were already fucked up. Also hi this is #jquery
[16:09:21] <boytoy> he totally snapped started attacking the cops and everything
[16:09:45] <coldhead> psychos gonna psych
[16:09:49] <coldhead> hey jrajav
[16:09:51] <boytoy> they put him on meds though so now he's back on the streets, with the occasional fallback whenever he hears last empror
[16:09:57] <coldhead> eep
[16:09:58] <jrajav> -_-
[16:20:14] <tugucci> hi, can anyone help a newbie?
[16:20:56] <systemfault> Only if the newbie can explain his problem to use.
[16:20:59] <systemfault> *us
[16:21:35] <coldhead> MAKE WITH THE QUESTIONS
[16:22:03] <tugucci> ok cool.
[16:25:30] <bakers> If I do a $("#bogus_selector") what's the RIGHT way to see if it returned anything
[16:25:41] <bakers> I'm just doing .length > 0
[16:26:15] <bakers> since an empty object evaluates to true, I can just do if ($("#bogus_selector"))
[16:27:07] <tugucci> I have a table,7 cells, each cell is of different color (rainbow colors). I also have a div, with a button. As i press the button I want bgcolors of cells to start changing colors from it's initial color of a cell throughout all the rainbow colors infinetly.
[16:27:30] <coldhead> bakers: .length is the usual way
[16:27:49] <coldhead> if ($('thing').length) { do_things() }
[16:27:50] <tugucci> How do I do the loop animation?
[16:28:24] <coldhead> that is not a n00b question, tugucci !
[16:30:26] <tugucci> Now as I have written it down it doesn't seem to be noob as well to me.
[16:32:34] <sedeki> is there a way to get the current hash in the URL? the anchor
[16:34:03] <shoky> location.hash
[16:34:03] <tugucci> I basically need hints. Where to look? I kind of tried to do it in a very straitforward way. Like when I press the button it writes down the CSS animation to the class, and in CSS i wrote all the keyframe stuff, but it didn't work.
[16:34:47] <tugucci> in fact i'm such a noob that i can't determine how difficult the problem is in the first place
[16:35:24] <basiclaser> i think being able to acknowledge little you know about something is very wise
[16:35:55] <basiclaser> a wise man admits he knows nothing at all yadayada..
[16:36:31] <tugucci> Haha, I'm not ashamed of that. =)
[16:36:52] <basiclaser> but in all seriousness you sound like your heads in the right place you're not charging in with any preconceptions
[16:39:13] <tugucci> so does anyone know approximately how to do that?
[16:42:14] <coldhead> i just wrote a working version for you tugucci
[16:42:17] <coldhead> then my browser crashed
[16:42:18] <coldhead> :(
[16:42:29] <tugucci> =(
[16:43:50] <systemfault> HA HA!!!!</nelson>
[16:48:33] <coldhead> tugucci: http://jsfiddle.net/KZHaK/1/
[16:48:47] <coldhead> that is a long way to what you want, i hope
[16:48:50] <coldhead> i am a hell of a guy
[16:49:01] <coldhead> i am using switchClass from jquery UI to aniamte the bg color
[16:51:16] <tugucci> thanks man!! give me a minute, I'll try do understand what you did
[16:51:45] <systemfault> :P
[16:52:02] <systemfault> coldhead: Would have been nicer with CSS3 animations :P
[16:52:13] <coldhead> would have been nicer if YOU did it, systemfault
[16:52:27] <coldhead> IT'S MY FIRST DAY USING JQUERY
[16:52:31] <coldhead> YOU CAN ALL GET STUFFED
[16:52:41] <coldhead> sorry mynotes
[16:54:12] <tubbo> ahahahaha
[16:54:39] <tubbo> so listen guys
[16:54:43] <tubbo> real talk for a second
[16:54:49] <tubbo> i'm pretty mad about the .live() thing ;)
[16:55:01] <tubbo> i liked having my javascript live and die thank you very much
[16:55:07] <tubbo> now my shit is just soulless on/off switches
[16:55:23] <relipse> is there a quick way to tell if any of the form values were changed?
[16:55:54] <Tomashe> i was setting a varible outside a function like plugin but when i try to alert the varibales i set i get nothing ... i set them before i load some plugin in order to use that inside
[16:56:01] <Tomashe> anyideas?
[16:56:01] <coldhead> tubbo: $.fn.live = $.fn.on; $.fn.die = $.fn.off;
[16:56:20] <coldhead> or you could wrap those better to make them API equivalent to the old way
[16:57:53] <tubbo> coldhead: yeah we have a lot of those live's in our code unfortunately. we're running that 1.8 shim plugin
[16:57:56] <tubbo> i forget what its called
[16:58:05] <tubbo> that basically rewrites the old features back in using the new on syntax
[16:58:06] <coldhead> live has been deprecated for years
[16:58:14] <coldhead> you were supposed to stop using it
[16:58:28] <coldhead> or you can keep using it but use an older jQuery
[16:58:31] <coldhead> they still work fine
[16:58:32] <tubbo> trust me, i don't. not a big fan of using live unless i need it
[16:58:49] <coldhead> but so in theory you don't need it
[16:58:54] <coldhead> because you can use on() now
[16:59:00] <tubbo> but the app in question wasn't fully developed by me haha
[16:59:03] <coldhead> and if you want to change the name, see above
[16:59:08] <coldhead> i feel your pain
[16:59:12] <coldhead> i'm still on jquery 1.6
[16:59:15] <tubbo> heh
[16:59:19] <coldhead> we're going to remain here forever i think
[16:59:23] <coldhead> time to find a new job!
[16:59:28] <tubbo> hmm
[16:59:42] <tubbo> have you seen that shim plugin? you can just run that to keep upgrading...i think it goes all the way back down to 1.6
[16:59:51] <systemfault> coldhead: For the lulz http://jsfiddle.net/b4pqm/
[17:00:13] <systemfault> Hmm.. I think I missed a transition
[17:00:16] <coldhead> yeah tubbo, that's too advanced for our developers
[17:00:37] <coldhead> systemfault: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THIS YOU MENTALIST
[17:00:58] <coldhead> tugucci: check systemfault's pure CSS way to do it http://jsfiddle.net/b4pqm/
[17:03:41] <tubbo> coldhead: actually i was wrong, it just gives you diagnostic messages https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/
[17:04:14] <coldhead> i thought it gave you diagnostics AND shims
[17:04:23] <coldhead> anyway i'm not allowed to use it so it's no matter
[17:04:28] <systemfault> Same.
[17:04:31] <tubbo> it gives *me* diagnostics and shims
[17:04:33] <coldhead> jquery 1.8 is a classic we can enjoy for many years
[17:04:34] <tubbo> 1.8
[17:04:50] <tubbo> but i think below that it just gives you dep warnings
[17:05:24] <joaquin_> would be good to have ppl like here in the php channel
[17:06:38] <systemfault> I'm surprised the #jQuery channel is so nice despite its popularity
[17:06:40] <coldhead> ##php is in league with the devil, there is no hppe for them
[17:06:51] <systemfault> coldhead: You're being rude with the devil.
[17:06:59] <coldhead> god damn it, systemfault
[17:07:03] <coldhead> if i had ops i would kick you
[17:07:06] <systemfault> :(
[17:07:11] <coldhead> for your lovey dovey hippy attitude
[17:07:14] <coldhead> this is NOT a nice channel
[17:07:18] <coldhead> it's a HARD channel
[17:07:27] <coldhead> we're dealing with HARD PROBLEMS through GRITTED TEETH
[17:07:30] <coldhead> for no glory
[17:07:43] <coldhead> if i could i'd glass each and every one of you right in the face
[17:07:52] <coldhead> and then in the naughty bits, if i had time
[17:07:57] <systemfault> coldhead: Write a plugin to do it.
[17:08:14] <coldhead> $('*').glass({genitals: true})
[17:08:22] <coldhead> i think my plugin will use promises
[17:08:30] <coldhead> it will return promises to glass people
[17:08:57] <tugucci> $('.td1').css({'-moz-animation':'colorR 10s infinite',
[17:08:57] <tugucci>         '-webkit-animation':'colorR 3s infinite';});
[17:09:01] <joaquin_> so basically u hate each user
[17:09:06] <tugucci> ooops sorry
[17:09:54] <systemfault> tugucci: One thing you need to learn is that mixing CSS and Javascript is EVIL
[17:09:59] <coldhead> no i don't really joaquin_
[17:10:03] <coldhead> i was just being silly
[17:10:08] <joaquin_> haha
[17:10:10] <joaquin_> i know
[17:10:16] <coldhead> it makes me so mad when you misunderstand me
[17:10:19] <coldhead> it makes me hate you
[17:10:22] <coldhead> and want to glass you
[17:10:23] <coldhead> <3
[17:10:29] <joaquin_> anyways this should be jquery+php
[17:10:42] <coldhead> please no, i would leave
[17:10:52] <raj> haha
[17:10:53] <coldhead> php is not our problem :)
[17:10:54] <joaquin_> hehe
[17:11:04] <systemfault> tugucci: http://jsfiddle.net/b4pqm/1/
[17:11:22] <systemfault> tugucci: Always toggle class avoid .css as much as you possibly can
[17:12:25] <tubbo> joaquin_: ##php is a cesspool
[17:12:41] <coldhead> oh BinaryKitten, i was just conspicuously not mentioning you when someone was loving live()
[17:12:45] <coldhead> anytime, buddy
[17:12:59] <tubbo> who's loving live()?
[17:13:10] <coldhead> just some jerk
[17:13:13] <coldhead> it doesn't matter anymore
[17:13:15] <tubbo> fuck you man
[17:13:16] <tubbo> ;D
[17:13:18] <coldhead> let's get a kitten

[17:13:31] <joaquin_> tubbo:  some dudes need pussy over there
[17:13:47] <systemfault> .live was just bad it was slow and the name itself meant nothing.
[17:13:51] <Meztek> hey y'all. I wrote some code, working great but not sure its the right way. can anyone assist me please it would be much apprecited
[17:13:54] <systemfault> .delegate was already a better choice
[17:14:09] <tubbo> joaquin_: they should start learning rails i heard those dude get mad ass
[17:14:16] <beachandbytes> lol
[17:14:37] <beachandbytes> thats how i choose my programming languages

[17:15:36] <coldhead> there are actual women in this channel, with ALL the body parts you mentioned AND A LOT MORE

[17:16:23] <joaquin_> coldhead:  are u american?

[17:16:33] <coldhead> no i am not
[17:16:42] <Meztek> trying to create an infinite scroller
[17:16:49] * tubbo was being completely facetious between 20:13-20:14 and would like to make that known
[17:16:49] <joaquin_> ok so chavez wont hate you
[17:16:50] <coldhead> fine by me, Meztek
[17:17:01] <Meztek> appending and chaging the left at the same time...
[17:17:07] <systemfault> joaquin_: I'm canadian, does he hates me?
[17:17:11] <Meztek> is there not a chance there could be a flash or something?
[17:17:19] <coldhead> he might hate you for different reasons, systemfault
[17:17:20] <joaquin_> systemfault: not at all
[17:17:22] <joaquin_> haha
[17:17:33] <joaquin_> just americans
[17:17:34] <systemfault> :D
[17:18:02] <Meztek> coldhead: are you sure its 100% correct, i know it works, but im worried it might play up
[17:18:20] <coldhead> i can't be sure of the correctness,  ihaven't seen the code
[17:18:29] <coldhead> i'm just saying that doesn't look like a terrible way to do things
[17:18:39] <joaquin_> ok
[17:18:48] <joaquin_> gotta do a harlem shake
[17:18:53] <coldhead> it is my first day using jQuery so i might not be the best person to ask
[17:19:05] <Meztek> anyone over the age of 18 in here?
[17:19:17] <Meztek> thats a professional in their industry?
[17:19:19] <tubbo> Meztek: i'm 4
[17:19:35] <tubbo> Meztek: also yes
[17:19:45] <Meztek> 4yr old pro?
[17:19:51] <joaquin_> 18 and professional.. should finish school first
[17:19:54] <tubbo> i feel like most people here are
[17:19:59] <systemfault> Meztek: I'm 1 and a half year old
[17:20:06] <tubbo> i am 24 and professional in both my industries :$
[17:20:09] <Meztek> i dont consider you a professional unless your 28+
[17:20:34] <coldhead> mmm, fascinating
[17:20:42] <tubbo> oh ok, well my definition of professional above is "get paid doing it"
[17:20:45] <systemfault> Meztek: Unfortunately, age doesn't mean much in our field.
[17:20:56] <coldhead> professional to me means "anything i can't afford"
[17:21:16] <coldhead> professional headphones, professional boyfriend, professional musical instruments
[17:21:18] <systemfault> coldhead: Yeah.. I wanted a professional set of knives for cooking..
[17:21:29] <coldhead> i can't afford those
[17:21:31] <coldhead> :(
[17:21:32] <joaquin_> im 23 and stupid for this field.. but i make good money
[17:21:33] <systemfault> :(
[17:21:35] <Meztek> ive seen it all,  28-32 you find the best developers for modern day
[17:21:35] <tubbo> coldhead: that's usually what "first class" means to me
[17:21:51] <tubbo> Meztek: fuck you i'm a wizard
[17:21:53] <coldhead> damn, you get 4 good years?
[17:21:59] <coldhead> and then that's it
[17:22:01] <Meztek> yep
[17:22:03] <Meztek> lol
[17:22:03] <tubbo> ;-D
[17:22:03] <coldhead> gotta mow lawns
[17:22:30] <Meztek> ok so none of the 'professionals' here can help me
[17:22:34] <systemfault> Nope.
[17:22:40] <systemfault> We're all n00bs
[17:22:41] <Meztek> wicked!
[17:22:42] <joaquin_> haha
[17:22:48] <tubbo> Meztek: how old are you?
[17:23:03] <systemfault> It's my first hour doing jQuery.. and coldhead, his first day
[17:23:11] <joaquin_> well you should come up earlier... there are some guys with good skills
[17:23:11] <Meztek> old enough
[17:23:23] <tubbo> Meztek: oh you're so old you won't tell me now
[17:23:26] <tubbo> what are you 40
[17:23:33] <Meztek> not quite
[17:23:37] <tubbo> or maybe YOU are the young'in
[17:23:41] <Meztek> nah
[17:23:45] <Meztek> in the middle somewhere
[17:23:49] <tubbo> =D
[17:24:36] <LocalPCGuy> I'm older than your ideal range as well Meztek
[17:24:54] <systemfault> I'm in between
[17:24:54] <tubbo> Meztek: i don't think age matters as much as stability and settledness
[17:24:56] <Meztek> localpcguy.. u had much exp with jquery? or javascript in general?
[17:25:02] <tubbo> in terms of what i've seen
[17:25:08] <LocalPCGuy> I spent a few hours reading a book today
[17:25:12] <tubbo> because i am definitely more responsible than a lot of 28 year olds i know
[17:25:17] <tubbo> *and* make more money
[17:25:19] <Meztek> ok this channel is crazy
[17:25:22] <tubbo> (they aren't programmers fwiw)
[17:25:35] <systemfault> Meztek: Crazy programmers are the best :/
[17:25:37] <LocalPCGuy> u actually trying to get a ? answered?
[17:25:38] <Meztek> if you use wordpress please dont consider yourself a developer :)
[17:25:48] <LocalPCGuy> nice blanket statement
[17:25:58] <tubbo> Meztek: you listen here old man
[17:26:05] <tubbo> we don't take too kindly to your talkin around here
[17:26:12] <systemfault> Meztek: wordpress or not it doesn't change much for a frontend.
[17:26:13] <tubbo> this is a kid's world and you better just shape up or ship out
[17:26:13] <coldhead> IS THERE ANYONE HERE BETWEEN 28 AND 32 WHO DOESN'T USE WORDPRESS WHO CAN HELP MEZTEK WITH A PROBLEM
[17:26:19] <LocalPCGuy> there are places for WP, just not a lot
[17:26:28] <systemfault> coldhead: IMPOOSSSIBBRUU!!

[17:26:48] <systemfault> I'm 30 and doesn't use wordpress
[17:26:52] <systemfault> So what?
[17:26:55] <systemfault> Do I win anything?
[17:27:00] <coldhead> systemfault: you are a professional
[17:27:03] <Meztek> hahah

[17:31:45] <coldhead> god i am so cold and alone
[17:32:06] <systemfault> :/

[17:36:52] <sedeki> how can I see if something is undefined?
[17:37:07] <sedeki> I'm trying if (obj) doStuff();
[17:37:15] <sedeki> but it's keep doing stuff anyways
[17:37:21] <sedeki> keeping
[17:37:23] <systemfault> sedeki: It should work as undefined is falsy
[17:37:37] <systemfault> ?js  var x; if (x) { console.log('hello'); }
[17:37:39] <bot-t> systemfault: undefined
[17:38:10] <coldhead> what is x? you might want x.length?
[17:40:59] <djQuery> ?js var x; if(x==null){console.log('hello'); }
[17:40:59] <bot-t> djQuery: "hello"
[17:41:10] <djQuery> ?js if(x==null){console.log('hello'); }

[17:42:07] <LocalPCGuy> sedeki actually, don't use jQuery typeof, just use typeof
[17:46:40] * coldhead np: dappled cities - hold your back
[17:49:39] <naeluh> coldhead: yes we are
[18:09:36] <LocalPCGuy>  /join #leap
[18:09:39] <LocalPCGuy> doh
[18:09:53] <coldhead> everyone type /clear, quick
[18:13:06] <jtal> should I be able to use a variable for selector?
[18:13:46] <coldhead> yes
[18:13:55] <coldhead> but you might need to add . or #
[18:14:01] <jtal> I have a string that works if I paste it into $(...)
[18:14:04] <jtal> but not $(var)
[18:14:10] <coldhead> var s = 'someclass'; $('.' + s);
[18:14:14] <LocalPCGuy> what is the string?
[18:14:34] <jtal> k="name='document\\.emails\\[0\\]\\.emailAddress'"
[18:14:56] <jtal> maybe the single quotes?
[18:15:40] <jtal> nope
[18:16:12] <LocalPCGuy> jtal what is with the \\
[18:16:23] <jtal> escaping characters
[18:16:26] <jtal> for IE
[18:16:34] <LocalPCGuy> jtal why?
[18:16:41] <jtal> it doesnt work in IE without it
[18:16:59] <coldhead> you probably need more \\s
[18:17:25] <coldhead> how is that even a CSS selector anyway >: \
[18:17:34] <LocalPCGuy> jtal the \\ are in the actual name?
[18:17:34] <systemfault> It's a bad joke.
[18:17:56] <systemfault> LocalPCGuy: It's the jQuery way to escape a . IIRC
[18:18:03] <systemfault> Inside a selector
[18:18:07] <jtal> yes
[18:18:08] <coldhead> ew
[18:18:22] <coldhead> guys i am having a club sandwich today
[18:19:04] <systemfault> With cheese?
[18:19:08] <coldhead> yes
[18:19:17] <LocalPCGuy> ugh
[18:19:18] <coldhead> and avocado
[18:19:25] <coldhead> luncheon of champions
[18:19:34] <LocalPCGuy> oops. .. about the escaping, not the club sandwich, that sounds good
[18:20:45] <LocalPCGuy> jtal why not just do k = "\\[name$='emailAddress'\\]";
[18:20:48] <djQuery> how to prevent jquery mobile from hiding my table headers?
[18:21:20] <LocalPCGuy> umm...sorry, not escaping for my string
[18:21:32] <LocalPCGuy> jtal k = "[name$='emailAddress']";
[18:21:54] <LocalPCGuy> jtal no need to escape if it is part of the selector
[18:22:37] <coldhead> djQuery: thead {display: block !important; } ?
[18:23:39] <djQuery> coldhead, nopers
[18:24:20] <jtal> LocalPCGuy: yes, as I've said already, you do have to escape special characters in jquery selectors for IE
[18:24:49] <LocalPCGuy> jtal yah, but not if it is part of the selector and not part of the name
[18:24:59] <LocalPCGuy> jtal I pulled up the docs
[18:25:08] <jtal> it is part of the name of the element I am looking for
[18:25:17] <coldhead> let's just not have special characters anywhere that need escaping
[18:25:19] <LocalPCGuy> jtal no, not with the selector I gave you
[18:25:39] <jtal> coldhead: unforunately when you work on large projects you often dont have control over all the code
[18:25:41] <LocalPCGuy> jtal if you do $= it matches the end - do you have multiple names that end with email
[18:25:48] <LocalPCGuy> emailAddress I mean
[18:26:09] <jtal> yes that is why they are called document.email[i].emailAddress
[18:26:11] <jtal> where i iterates
[18:26:17] <relipse>  if the user accidentally pressed the back button, how do I ask him if he is sure he wants to quit without saving changes ?
[18:26:36] <LocalPCGuy> jtal well that isn't the same as [0] which is what you put
[18:26:55] <LocalPCGuy> jtal still, do you want a collection of all of them or just that specific one?
[18:27:09] <jtal> just one
[18:27:31] <jtal> I think developer console is confusing me because its eating up some of the escape characters sometimes
[18:28:51] <LocalPCGuy> jtal so do you want a single specific one or a collection of all of the email address fields
[18:29:06] <jtal> just that specific one
[18:30:08] <coldhead> jtal: even on a very large project i would complain bitterly about having to use those selectors
[18:30:15] <coldhead> but then i complain bitterly whatever happens
[18:30:20] <coldhead> it's just my way
[18:30:30] <jtal> heh yeah I complain sometimes too
[18:30:54] <jtal> it has no effect if the people who write that part arent in your team or even company/etc
[18:31:51] <coldhead> i would still try to get them fired
[18:31:56] <jtal> hah
[18:32:00] <coldhead> or horribly burned in a deep fryer explosion
[18:32:05] <jtal> its a very large open source project
[18:32:08] <jtal> figured it out
[18:32:11] <jtal> too many \'s
[18:32:13] <coldhead> pull requests!
[18:32:25] <coldhead> that was very frustrating, good work jtal
[18:32:31] <coldhead> may that be the worst bug you face this week
[18:32:52] <jtal> psh I wish
[18:33:18] <coldhead> a man can dream
[18:33:37] <LocalPCGuy> relipse you should be able to listen for the beforeunload event
[18:34:11] <jtal> I have not had to care about IE for like 5 years... I dont like it
[18:35:33] <jtal> also I have to use jquery 1.4.2 for at least the next 3 months haha
[18:36:26] <coldhead> ouch
[18:39:00] <LocalPCGuy> I feel sad for you
[18:42:15] <jtal> yes let me be a lesson to all of you :> dont let it happen to you
[18:44:31] <boytoy> http://jsfiddle.net/jUWk2/ -- using this supersimple lightbox that I made to close whenever you click outside the lightbox itself. But how come it only works the first time I open/close it?
[18:45:01] <lolyzor> does enyone have problems with panels, i have a page with panel, but the panel is allways open
[18:45:20] <lolyzor> it is allways visible
[18:45:53] <lolyzor> here is my code http://tny.cz/b2bf3f65
[18:45:55] <coldhead> it works for me, boytoy
[18:46:19] <boytoy> coldhead: yup for me too but not the 2nd time around
[18:48:13] <boytoy> (i.e. the second time it also disappears when clicking on "I'm Boytoy's demo"
[18:48:14] <boytoy> )
[19:04:26] <solarflares> so anyone know any good off-topic programming channels? I used to have a group but they got all pretentious and anti-web
[19:05:51] <LocalPCGuy> anyone else use znc?
[19:06:35] <solarflares> just how local are you
[19:08:37] <LocalPCGuy> depends where you are
[19:11:22] <solarflares> i wish i was jaime lannister kind of
[19:11:37] <solarflares> minus the part where *spoiler*
[19:12:11] <LocalPCGuy> hah...books I take it, seeing as the show hasn't gotten to *spoiler* yet
[19:12:24] <solarflares> yes
[19:12:34] <solarflares> oh i didn't expect that actually
[19:12:50] <solarflares> seems like most places in IRC I go people haven't read them
[19:13:13] <LocalPCGuy> of course, there is the whole incest stuff
[19:13:21] <LocalPCGuy> that you'd have to deal with
[19:13:30] <solarflares> *ahem* yeah deal with....
[19:13:33] <LocalPCGuy> lol
[19:13:46] <solarflares> that one is going to be especially hard
[19:14:33] <solarflares> yeah, sucks how long we have to wait for the next one
[19:14:44] <solarflares> also have you seen GRRM's personal website, it is soooooooo bad
[19:14:59] <solarflares> http://georgerrmartin.com/
[19:15:28] <solarflares> like why doesn't he let one of his probably thousands of fans who are talented web developers make it awesome for him
[19:15:58] <LocalPCGuy> got disconnected (setting up znc and killed the service to edit the conf file)
[19:16:14] <solarflares> shame!
[19:16:16] <LocalPCGuy> but I presume you are talking about his absolutely dreadful website
[19:16:21] <solarflares> yes
[19:16:54] <solarflares> the lavender behemoth
[19:18:17] <solarflares> someone should just make a GRRM Beautify plugin
[19:18:33] * yogurt_truck examines the site electroencephalographically
[19:19:04] <tw2113> i find it funny that CodeAcademy just sent out an email about a Twitter App, the same day Twitter is castrating 3rd party devs
[19:19:47] <solarflares> i dont think codecademy is going about it right
[19:19:50] <solarflares> with how they teach
[19:20:48] <naeluh> solarflares: im sorry but that is one of the coolest websites I have ever seen
[19:21:10] <tw2113> solarflares, i agree, everyone should just use w3schools
[19:21:14] <tw2113> *goes to hang himself*
[19:21:39] <LocalPCGuy> I have a co-worker who likes w3schools because it's easy to "try" stuff in the iframes...
[19:21:44] <LocalPCGuy> ...um...console?
[19:21:44] <solarflares> I did all their courses on the beginning of my javascript journey and didn't feel like I learned very much. Whereas when I did nettuts video courses I learned like super fast and retained a lot of it
[19:22:12] <solarflares> and I felt that the people who teach the nettuts courses try to teach you good coding habits early on
[19:22:18] <solarflares> because its easy to make bad javascripts
[19:22:40] <solarflares> and really tempting when you dont understand why its bad yet
[19:23:19] <shoky> i kinda agree about codeacademy.. from what i saw of their html/css/javascript courses. and from watching a total-noob friend of mine try to learn from there
[19:23:22] <arepie> hello, im trying to make async ajax query.. http://jsfiddle.net/N4c22/1/ it looks like, i can't make it async = false.. anyone please help
[19:24:15] <solarflares> It's hard to beat a video tutorlal or screencast on one screen and a text editor on the other for learning
[19:24:20] <solarflares> or documentation
[19:24:24] <solarflares> whatever floats your boat
[19:24:42] <shoky> ?async
[19:24:43] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the users ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[19:25:46] <solarflares> hmm what other interesting tidbits does shaky have
[19:25:54] <solarflares> ?closures
[19:25:54] <bot-t> JavaScript Closures - http://blog.morrisjohns.com/javascript_closures_for_dummies.html and http://bit.ly/iife-closures
[19:26:04] <solarflares> hey i saw that link yesterday
[19:26:23] <LocalPCGuy> although I think you need to pull it up through the Wayback Machine now
[19:26:31] <solarflares> i meant to say bot-t not shaky
[19:26:49] <shoky> yeah, no interesting tidbits from me
[19:27:24] <solarflares> oh btw for that link you have to use webarchive cause i think he took it down
[19:27:44] <solarflares> morrisjohns doesnt want anyone to learn his secret closure knowledge
[19:28:51] <solarflares> here is the correct link http://web.archive.org/web/20080209105120/http://blog.morrisjohns.com/javascript_closures_for_dummies
[19:29:37] <gelicia> Hey all, I have a quick question. I have this http://tributary.io/inlet/5095509 and I'm looking to get the states in data defined in line 12 and automatically generate the list of distinct states in line 18 automatically
[19:30:16] <gelicia> I have a feeling this is something that would be very easily done in jquery and I could do it but I have a feeling there's something easy
[19:31:41] <coldhead> what the devil
[19:31:51] <coldhead> give me my fiddle stick
[19:38:26] <solarflares> no fiddles for u
[19:38:40] <gelicia> haha are you talking to me?
[19:38:41] <LocalPCGuy> gelicia you can use $.map
[19:38:59] <DrPoole> hello friends.
[19:39:13] <gelicia> okay :)
[19:39:37] <LocalPCGuy> gelicia I have a fiddle almost set
[19:39:50] <DrPoole> im trying (and failing miserably) at getting .autocomplete to only fire when a "go!" button is clicked.  ive tried wrapping it in a selector, tried running it through the "search" command.  googled my tits off.  i suck at life.
[19:40:05] <DrPoole> tried preventDefault
[19:40:15] <gelicia> oh, thank you LocalPCGuy :)
[19:40:18] <DrPoole> by adding an keypress method
[19:40:32] <solarflares> take a picture of your tits detached from your body and we will help you
[19:40:39] <DrPoole> already uploading
[19:40:43] <solarflares> and post code
[19:40:56] <DrPoole> wasn't sure if i needed to include my lower half...i did and make no apologies for it
[19:42:00] <solarflares> im going to the grocery store
[19:42:01] <solarflares> brb
[19:52:44] <mg983> Hi guys. Can someone explain to me why this page renders so differently on Chrome vs. Firefox? http://native.matgargano.com/then click on INFO at the top
[20:02:02] <LocalPCGuy> gelicia http://jsfiddle.net/localpcguy/Q36gz/
[20:02:05] <LocalPCGuy> gelicia try that
[20:02:40] <LocalPCGuy> gelicia sorry it took so long, I had to look up a unique function, I always forget that jQuery.unique only is designed for DOM elements
[20:03:32] <LocalPCGuy> gelicia and you could probably take that and move it all into it's own function that returns the uniqueStates
[20:03:48] <LocalPCGuy> gelicia with input of data
[20:04:01] <gelicia> yeah, that's perfect, thank you :)
[20:06:24] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: _ has unique
[20:06:57] <LocalPCGuy> yah, I didn't want to introduce another library just for unique.  I think _ might be a bit more efficient than the fiddle I linked
[20:07:33] <LocalPCGuy> but I've been loving _ a lot lately
[20:07:38] <gelicia> some of _ comes as a dependancy to another library i use so it might not matter.
[20:08:31] <LocalPCGuy> ah, nice.  well, you can take out the unique function and use _.unique then.
[20:09:06] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: check out lodash
[20:09:10] <gnarf> http://lodash.com/
[20:09:51] <LocalPCGuy> gnarf "built for modern environments" :(
[20:10:09] <LocalPCGuy> often have to support back to IE7 :'(
[20:10:21] <gnarf> lodash legacy include="unique"
[20:10:21] <gnarf> :)
[20:10:35] <LocalPCGuy> ah...I see it has the compatibility modes
[20:10:38] <LocalPCGuy> oh...yah
[20:10:53] <gelicia> Thanks again everyone!
[20:11:05] <gnarf> lodash is also jdalton, who is also jsperf
[20:11:30] <LocalPCGuy> nice...I tried to fund the book (that was him, right?) on kickstarter
[20:11:47] <LocalPCGuy> or was that just "about" jsperf
[20:12:38] <LocalPCGuy> that looks nice though
[20:12:39] <solarflares> so last episode of the walking dead was quite possibly the best episode they've had since the first few
[20:14:26] <LocalPCGuy> btw gnarf, not sure if it was you or someone else that told me about znc...if it was you, it's pretty cool, thanks!
[20:14:40] <gnarf> prolly me
[20:14:41] <gnarf> :)
[20:14:47] <gnarf> maybe ryanneufeld
[20:14:59] <ryanneufeld> wasn't me
[20:15:05] <ryanneufeld> you can't prove anything
[20:15:11] <LocalPCGuy> hah
[20:15:17] <solarflares> omg
[20:15:17] <solarflares> guys

[20:15:19] <b-ot> gnarf:  It Wasn't Me by Shaggy and Ricardo Ducent 
[20:15:23] <solarflares> i just bought this horseradish cheddar cheese
[20:15:26] <solarflares> and its amazing
[20:15:58] <solarflares> mainly because it actually tastes like horseradish
[20:16:42] <tw2113> and that's a perk?
[20:16:48] <coldhead> way to be, solarflares
[20:16:51] <coldhead> i would nom that
[20:19:37] <tw2113> you freak :P
[20:21:22] <coldhead> horseradish is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy
[20:21:39] <tw2113> i'd believe that over the concent of bacon in the same place
[20:23:08] <solarflares> its a boars head cheese so if you have a deli near you that has boars head stuff they might have it
[20:24:48] <coldhead> boar's head products appear not to be available in my country
[20:24:52] <coldhead> i guess cheese doesn't travel well
[20:26:20] <solarflares> im sure you can buy it online somewhere
[20:26:34] <greg5green> that horseradish cheddar cheese
[20:26:37] <greg5green> is aweseome
[20:26:42] <solarflares> id have it overnighted though
[20:26:42] <greg5green> from boars head
[20:27:01] <solarflares> see more people validate its existence
[20:27:29] <solarflares> the first time i ate it i was like
[20:27:33] <solarflares> can cheese really do that?
[20:28:28] <solarflares> i felt like the committe of cheddars wouldnt allow horseradish cheddar to be cheddar cause it makes all the other cheddars look bad
[20:28:49] <tugucci> does anybody know how to make ajax clock, that will get time from server every minute?
[20:29:22] <coldhead> are you expecting time on the server to progress at a different rate to time in the browser?
[20:29:27] <coldhead> is this some relativity stuff?
[20:29:42] <LocalPCGuy> timetravel!!
[20:29:42] <coldhead> is the client travelling away from earth at a speed approaching that of light?
[20:29:52] <solarflares> i feel like the time might be off if you're using ajax calls, i dunno though
[20:30:49] <coldhead> lolll @ <solarflares> can cheese really do that?
[20:31:34] <greg5green> I really want some of that cheese now
[20:31:44] <greg5green> if there wasnt a snowstorm here right now, id todally be out buying some
[20:32:33] <solarflares> well now it can be another reason to wake up tomorrow
[20:32:54] <tugucci> ehm, i don't think it's a big problem, I'm doing a school project here, and I need to implement Ajax stuff for it, I'm so tired now and can't come up with something good...
[20:32:55] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: so what'd you think of the conf?
[20:33:29] <greg5green> tugucci, the issue with having a clock based on ajax calls is that transit time can be a bitch
[20:33:52] <LocalPCGuy> I really enjoyed it.  I think all of the speakers were top shelf, and most of the time there is a session or two where you walk out going "I wish I had gone to the other one that time"
[20:33:57] <tugucci> Is there anything simple? Just for the tick
[20:34:07] <LocalPCGuy> didn't really get that in TO
[20:34:16] <greg5green> you have to do the backend too?
[20:34:38] <LocalPCGuy> tugucci try an Ajax search?
[20:35:07] <gnarf> tugucci: http://www.mine-control.com/zack/timesync/timesync.html
[20:35:13] <solarflares> oh i bought a humble indie bundle today
[20:35:14] <tugucci> I think that getting text file is ok.
[20:35:14] <solarflares> i forgot
[20:35:41] <greg5green> just getting a text file?
[20:35:58] <greg5green> then why do something more difficult?
[20:36:16] <greg5green> anything I can think of requires some sort of backend work as well
[20:36:27] <greg5green> whether its php/node/ruby/assembly
[20:36:35] <tugucci> fair enough =)
[20:36:38] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: good to hear, there were some great speakers, sadly i missed most of the talks
[20:36:39] <greg5green> what about just lazy loading some images?
[20:37:07] <greg5green> err, i mean polite load, not lazy load
[20:37:31] <gnarf> images don't use XHR
[20:37:44] <solarflares> so nice to see changelog for all platforms with steam now
[20:38:03] <gnarf> tho with jaubourgs image transport for jquery ajax you can make it look like an ajax
[20:38:14] <greg5green> touch
[20:38:14] <LocalPCGuy> gnarf bummer, too busy finishing slides?
[20:38:21] <LocalPCGuy> :P
[20:38:38] <gnarf> https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/img.js
[20:38:59] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: not really, just busy wandering around and mingling with the other speakers
[20:39:13] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: i gave that talk in vienna the weekend before
[20:39:14] <coldhead> oh LocalPCGuy did you meet any of #jQuery's regulars?
[20:39:30] <LocalPCGuy> I met gnarf
[20:39:41] <coldhead> YAY
[20:39:45] <coldhead> not vladikoff?
[20:39:55] <coldhead> damn exclusive mofo
[20:39:56] <LocalPCGuy> since I didn't "know" that I met him, guess not
[20:40:13] <coldhead> he has FLOD tattooed on his forehead
[20:40:20] <coldhead> so if you didn't meet anyone with that
[20:40:21] <coldhead> then no
[20:40:23] <coldhead> :(
[20:40:33] <coldhead> he was probably too drunk to socialize
[20:40:41] <coldhead> sorry flod <3
[20:40:43] <LocalPCGuy> I was having a hard enough time remembering people's real names, trying to associate those with irc/twitter handles was, well...
[20:40:46] <gnarf> danheberden, kborchers, vladikoff, wesbos, darcyclarke, rworth, paulirish, etc?
[20:40:51] <relipse> how do i get the closest-previous radio button?
[20:41:05] <relipse> from a checkbox
[20:41:19] <gnarf> relipse: siblings?
[20:41:28] <gnarf> relipse: or is the radio potentially a child of a sibling?
[20:41:35] <relipse> umm
[20:41:43] <coldhead> cousins!
[20:41:49] <gnarf> cousins are hard to find
[20:41:54] <gnarf> coldhead: txjs this year?
[20:42:01] <tw2113> take notes coldhead
[20:42:03] <relipse> the radio buttons are siblings but each radio button has 3 checkboxse
[20:42:09] <NahimN> vladikoff is a boss
[20:42:11] <LocalPCGuy> gnarf yup. I know who most of the faces for those names now
[20:42:17] <tw2113> radio buttons have checkboxes?
[20:42:30] <gnarf> relipse: gist the html?
[20:43:02] <relipse> it looks like this: (o)[x][x][x] (o) [x][x][x] (o)[x][x][x]
[20:43:15] <relipse> i need it so that if i click a checkbox it automatically selects the closest radio button
[20:43:20] <relipse> (that is ABOVE it)
[20:43:31] <tw2113> o.O
[20:43:32] <gnarf> relipse: html?
[20:43:33] <vladikoff> i could not find LocalPCGuy
[20:43:41] <gnarf> vladikoff: he was at the pre-party
[20:43:44] <relipse> can't show you html
[20:43:50] <tw2113> why not
[20:43:50] <relipse> why don't you understand?
[20:43:51] <gnarf> relipse: ......
[20:43:54] <relipse> nda
[20:43:58] <coldhead> hahahahahah
[20:44:00] <tw2113> html is nda?
[20:44:07] <coldhead> PROPRIETARY HTML SECRETSSS
[20:44:08] <tw2113> does it hold classified info?
[20:44:15] <coldhead> OF THE 3RD REICH
[20:44:18] <gnarf> relipse: then reproduce the general structure and change content
[20:44:19] <relipse> please just help me
[20:44:24] <relipse> whill .closest() work?
[20:44:29] <tw2113> anyone who can view-source will be able to see it
[20:44:33] <gnarf> relipse: probably not, radio's can't have children
[20:44:36] <vladikoff> `minimal @ relipse
[20:44:36] <gnarf> you probably want something like
[20:44:41] <b-ot> relipse: A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less.  If it is more than 32 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case.
[20:44:52] <relipse> argg
[20:44:55] <gnarf> .closest('.radio-area').find('input[type=radio]')
[20:44:59] <coldhead> argc*
[20:45:16] <LocalPCGuy> relipse you could give .prevAll('input[type=radio]').eq(0)
[20:45:19] <LocalPCGuy> a shot
[20:45:29] <tw2113> i've never heard of radio buttons having checkboxes, to be honest
[20:45:36] <vladikoff> gnarf, what was he wearing
[20:45:40] <relipse> <input type="radio"><input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox"><input type="radio"><input type="checkbox"><input type="checkbox">
[20:45:46] <gnarf> then yeah
[20:45:48] <relipse> you guys need to think a little bit
[20:45:52] <relipse> no offense
[20:45:59] * tw2113 is offended anyway
[20:46:03] <gnarf> yeah
[20:46:03] <tw2113> bad use of form elements
[20:46:05] <LocalPCGuy> hmm...striped shirt, orange jacket
[20:46:15] <relipse> LocalPCGuy: prevALL will work?
[20:46:18] <LocalPCGuy> although I ditched the jacket pretty quick
[20:46:20] <coldhead> that is pretty offensive
[20:46:25] <LocalPCGuy> relipse depends on your HTML
[20:46:31] <relipse> i just told you my html
[20:46:33] <tw2113> he apparently pasted it above
[20:46:35] <gnarf> relipse: prevAll('input[type=radio]').eq(0) seems right if the above is what the HTML looks like
[20:46:44] <relipse> sounds right
[20:46:46] <relipse> i'll give it a shot thanks
[20:46:58] <gnarf> relipse: and don't be a douche
[20:47:03] <gnarf> ....
[20:47:04] <LocalPCGuy> vladikoff my co-worker Karen came in about half-way through the pre-party
[20:47:36] <coldhead> prevAll('input[type="radio"]:first') // readability
[20:47:37] <gnarf> relipse: pain in the dick/whatever... we asked a simple question because everyone in here has a different idea for how they would try to (not) model that sort of thing in html
[20:47:45] <vladikoff> LocalPCGuy, you were sitting on the left side of the entrance right?
[20:47:48] <gnarf> personally, i would use more classes/wrappers
[20:47:49] <relipse> will this work: $('input[type=checkbox]').click(){
[20:47:49] <relipse>      $(this).prevAll('input[type=radio]').eq(0).checked = true;
[20:47:49] <relipse>    }
[20:47:56] <ezio> $('[data-toggle-name="test1"] button').live ... object has no method live ... anyone know what's going on?
[20:48:07] <coldhead> flod's photographic memory <3
[20:48:15] <tw2113> ezio, live() was removed in 1.9 if i recall right
[20:48:22] <gnarf> relipse: [0] if you want the DOMElement to assign .checked to
[20:48:23] <coldhead> ezio: use an older jQuery
[20:48:27] <gnarf> relipse: instead of .eq(0)
[20:48:30] <LocalPCGuy> vladikoff kinda straight against the back wall, talking to Matt (TO local) and Wesbos a fair amount
[20:48:37] <ezio> geez ... didn't it just replace click?
[20:48:43] <asdasd> hi
[20:48:45] <tw2113> .on()
[20:48:48] <LocalPCGuy> ezio nope...live = dead
[20:48:51] <tw2113> use that instead of live()
[20:48:54] <vladikoff> ezio, http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#live-removed
[20:49:01] <gnarf> i think vladikoff wants pictures of your outfit LocalPCGuy ;)
[20:49:11] <ezio> oh yeah
[20:49:11] <solarflares> guys check out this game i got
[20:49:12] <ezio> on
[20:49:15] <ezio> that's what i wanted
[20:49:16] <solarflares> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZxfy1f7Tmw
[20:49:17] <asdasd> anyone give me this source code
[20:49:27] <coldhead> long day is long
[20:49:50] <vladikoff> asdasd, http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js
[20:50:02] <coldhead> asdasd: view-source:www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZxfy1f7Tmw
[20:50:32] <relipse> darn it didn't work
[20:50:47] <asdasd> nice solar 2
[20:50:57] <relipse> how can i just keep going UP the document until I find a radio box?
[20:51:00] <LocalPCGuy> vladikoff off my hardly ever used twitter: https://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_images/754759219/mike_for_web_original_lightened_bigger.JPG
[20:51:02] <asdasd> http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=do+the+harlem+shake&oq=do+the+harlem+shake&gs_l=youtube.12...0.0.0.6807.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.0...1ac
[20:51:03] <gnarf> relipse: maybe you need to think a little bit...
[20:51:08] <gnarf> relipse: <input> can't have children
[20:51:10] <solarflares> solar 2 looks fun
[20:51:12] <gnarf> so you won't find it going up
[20:51:13] <gnarf> also
[20:51:14] <solarflares> i havent played it yet
[20:51:14] <relipse> gnarf: duh
[20:51:16] <vladikoff> LocalPCGuy, oh man i can't believe we didn't chat
[20:51:24] <relipse> i know but i havae the checkboxes wrapped in a <ul>
[20:51:26] <gnarf> now do you see why we requested your html?
[20:51:29] <relipse> fine
[20:51:32] <relipse> i'll give you my html
[20:53:06] <test_> how to make free chat websocket
[20:53:11] <LocalPCGuy> vladikoff I know
[20:53:26] <tw2113> why are you using checkboxes to select a radio button instead of just selecting the radio button directly?
[20:59:46] <relipse> why doesn't this work: http://jsbin.com/exusaj/1/edit
[20:59:59] <relipse> i'm trying to use prevAll
[21:00:33] <LocalPCGuy> relipse prevAll will only work on siblings, the radio buttons are not siblings
[21:00:36] <tw2113> why not just select the radio buttion itself?
[21:01:07] <_xa1nthi> Under what circumstances do the following two methods of binding a click event to a paragraph not behave the same? $("p").live("click", function() { alert("p clicked") }) and $("p").click(function(){ alert("p clicked") });
[21:01:43] <relipse> LocalPCGuy: ok so i need to find the <ul> element and then use privall
[21:01:50] <relipse> gotta get the correct # of parents
[21:01:58] <djQuery> relipse, see ? change
[21:01:58] <bot-t> relipse, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[21:02:10] <tw2113> why not attach a click handler to the li groupings that selects radio button by ID
[21:02:32] <LocalPCGuy> relipse http://jsbin.com/exusaj/2/
[21:02:47] <LocalPCGuy> relipse if you want to walk the dom
[21:03:26] <relipse> LocalPCGuy: i think relying on the h3 tag is dangerous
[21:03:42] <relipse> it works thank you, but what about just finding the radio button
[21:03:50] <LocalPCGuy> relipse I think relying on the DOM structure period is probably a bit dangerous, but my JS works
[21:04:06] <relipse> if the html editor changes the h3 to h2 it will break
[21:04:14] <relipse> can you account for that?
[21:04:41] <LocalPCGuy> relipse right.  better would be to add a container like tw2113 was saying and the use that as the key point
[21:04:49] <tw2113> user interaction flow needs reworked imho
[21:05:43] <LocalPCGuy> relipse http://jsbin.com/exusaj/2/
[21:05:49] <gnarf> relipse: back to my earlier mention of .closest('.radio-area').find('input[type=radio]')
[21:06:06] <gnarf> where .radio-area would contain the radio and all the checkboxes by nature of it's structure
[21:06:07] <LocalPCGuy> relipse yah, what gnarf said...
[21:06:31] <LocalPCGuy> relipse you should also consider unchecking all of the checkboxes not associated with the selected radio button
[21:07:10] <gnarf> vladikoff: just had a 20% moment ;)
[21:07:23] <gnarf> vladikoff: or were you not there for the 20% inside joke?
[21:07:40] <vladikoff> gnarf, no
[21:07:41] <gnarf> i don't remember... you like rode in late to that dinner monday ;)
[21:07:49] <relipse> thanks LocalPCGuy: that is great
[21:07:55] <relipse> what does .selection mean?
[21:08:06] <tw2113> ?selection @ tw2113
[21:08:09] <LocalPCGuy> relipse that is just what I used for the class
[21:08:10] <bot-t> tw2113, API/1.1.2/DOM/Traversing/Selectors - jQuery Wiki - This is an old version of the Selectors API: View the Current API http://docs.jquery.com/API/1.1.2/DOM/Traversing/Selectors
[21:08:31] <tw2113> ah
[21:08:41] <LocalPCGuy> relipse you could use .radio-area like gnarf suggests, or any other class that makes sense to contain those form elements
[21:09:15] <LocalPCGuy> relipse changed to radio-area to demonstrate
[21:09:33] <tw2113> doh! any oldschool WWF fans?
[21:10:11] <relipse> LocalPCGuy: ok i got it now i changed my html a bit
[21:10:15] <LocalPCGuy> ok
[21:10:18] <relipse> now one for your nogin...
[21:10:24] <relipse> how do i uncheck all theo ther checkboxes?
[21:10:27] <relipse> NOT in that selection?
[21:10:59] <tw2113> wtf are concocting over there?
[21:11:28] <relipse> it makes sense, only 1 radio box can be selected and only the 3 checkboxes count
[21:11:37] <tw2113> not really
[21:11:38] <relipse> in THAT .selection
[21:11:44] <gnarf> relipse: var radioArea = $( this ).closest( ".radio-area" ); $( ".radio-area" ).not( radioArea ).find( "input[type=checkbox]" ).prop( "checked", false ); radioArea.find( "input[type=radio]" ).prop( "checked", true );
[21:11:51] <relipse> instead of questioning and insulting you could try jsbin.com to help me
[21:12:12] <tw2113> i'm trying to figure out what you're doing and if there's a better less noodle way to do it
[21:12:45] <tw2113> you can consider it me insulting as much as you care to
[21:13:12] <gnarf> relipse: i don't think he's being very insulting, but you gotta realize, we are here to try to help you do this the "right" way, and this UI just seems clumsy/strange to begin with
[21:13:14] <LocalPCGuy> relipse there is a difference between asking for help, and asking people to write your code for you...
[21:13:27] <relipse> gnarf: you are a genius, thank you
[21:13:29] <coldhead> i think we should all stop actual debugging until we've worked out exactly where we all stand in relation to offending each other and what we should be doing
[21:13:31] <gnarf> relipse: also, you should make sure to use .on( "change" ) instead of .click
[21:13:40] <relipse> yep changed it to .change()
[21:13:44] <vladikoff> coldhead, that sounds pretty offensive
[21:13:57] <tw2113> you're new here coldhead, so...no
[21:13:58] <LocalPCGuy> relipse .change() is just .on('change',
[21:14:04] <coldhead> I'M NEVER HELPING YOU WITH ANYTHING VLADIKOFF
[21:14:04] <relipse> i know that
[21:14:08] <LocalPCGuy> ok
[21:14:22] <vladikoff> :(
[21:14:36] <relipse> sweet it works like a charm
[21:14:40] <relipse> i should give you a % of my paycheck
[21:14:41] <tw2113> did he ever in the first place vladikoff ?
[21:14:47] <gnarf> .on("change", fn) is more "idiomatic" - it looks like other jQuery code
[21:14:58] <vladikoff> tw2113, all the time :(
[21:15:00] <LocalPCGuy> so vladikoff what is the prevailing opinion of the 3 Brewers in TO?
[21:15:02] <tw2113> oh
[21:15:02] <gnarf> also its one less function call, since .change() just calls .on()
[21:15:03] <tw2113> shit
[21:15:57] <vladikoff> LocalPCGuy, no clue!
[21:16:12] <coldhead> make something up
[21:16:18] <coldhead> say their poutine is a little dry
[21:16:20] <gnarf> relipse: https://www.gittip.com/gnarf37/
[21:16:30] <coldhead> AHAHAHAH gnarf <3
[21:16:43] <LocalPCGuy> I found it walking around Sunday night (no wifi once I was out/about) and I enjoyed it quite a bit...good beer
[21:17:48] <gnarf> that pulled pork poutine in that chain restaurant was pretty amazing
[21:18:08] <vladikoff> gnarf, that place is amazing
[21:18:11] <tw2113> *checks the time and how much he has logged for client work today*
[21:18:27] <tw2113> shit, i need to get some more on the clock work done soon
[21:19:09] <LocalPCGuy> I was actually looking for the poutine place on aedelade(sp?) but I don't think I walked far enough east
[21:19:22] <coldhead> adelaide*
[21:19:27] <LocalPCGuy> yah, that's it
[21:19:29] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: i wish they had given us an extra hour for lunch...
[21:19:38] <gnarf> barely had time to eat anywhere without missing a talk
[21:19:47] <LocalPCGuy> it did seem a bit rushed
[21:19:49] <coldhead> and yet you missed them all anyway
[21:19:55] <LocalPCGuy> lol
[21:19:59] <gnarf> truth
[21:20:15] <gnarf> i caught part of both of dans
[21:20:20] <gnarf> and addy's
[21:20:34] <gnarf> also, monika's talk about process was pretty awesome
[21:21:12] <LocalPCGuy> I was pretty bummed I didn't get in to see her talk (no offense to ajpiano) - I walked over but it was packed
[21:21:41] <tw2113> jQueryTo or whatever?
[21:21:47] <tw2113> i'm waiting for videos :D
[21:21:48] <LocalPCGuy> yah
[21:21:57] <vladikoff> tw2113, no video
[21:21:59] <LocalPCGuy> not sure if I saw a camera?
[21:22:04] <tw2113> damn it if not
[21:22:05] <wesbos> that guy that did html5 hardware Apis was sweet
[21:22:29] <vladikoff> darcy?
[21:22:56] <vladikoff> (it was wesbos!)
[21:22:57] <wesbos> lol
[21:23:17] <wesbos> man I haven't been in here for like 2 months
[21:23:35] <wesbos> who needs help with slideup()
[21:23:44] <coldhead> i thought darcy and wesbos were the same guy
[21:23:55] <wesbos> we are
[21:24:00] <LocalPCGuy> the 3d talk gave me lots of ideas to play with with the Leap device
[21:24:03] <coldhead> phew
[21:24:24] <wesbos> I wish they were recorded
[21:24:27] <gnarf> tw2113: yeah, Portland should be recorded
[21:24:44] <gnarf> wesbos: i wish vienna recorded too
[21:24:44] <tw2113> i'm a sucker for recorded presentations, what can i say
[21:24:58] <gnarf> tw2113: unsure if UK plans on recording
[21:25:14] <tw2113> it's 2012, record these things and distribute online
[21:25:22] <tw2113> storage is cheap
[21:25:33] <phonebook_> hey
[21:25:41] <phonebook_> ...its 2011
[21:26:01] <tw2113> fix your date function
[21:26:07] <tw2113> oops
[21:26:09] <tw2113> it's 2013!
[21:26:12] <tw2113> shit
[21:26:50] <tw2113> regardless, RIP Paul Bearer
[21:27:15] <coldhead> bye forever, paul bearer
[21:27:19] <coldhead> we will never forget you
[21:28:11] <tw2113> not sure who that is coldhead ?
[21:28:17] <coldhead> i just looked it up
[21:28:22] <coldhead> and now i will never forget him
[21:28:31] <tw2113> :D
[21:28:48] <coldhead> he was a better man than i could ever hope to be
[21:28:57] <coldhead> in the sense of fatter, mostly
[21:29:02] <coldhead> but also other important senses
[21:29:19] <coldhead> it's sad when people die
[21:29:21] <coldhead> also hilarious
[21:29:24] <coldhead> but especially sad
[21:29:56] <phonebook_> theyre still there. just in the past
[21:30:38] <coldhead> like a butterfly trapped in the amber of yesteryear
[21:31:08] <tw2113> like a bullet with butterfly wings?
[21:31:48] <coldhead> hey whatever floats your boats
[21:31:55] <coldhead> i think your eyeliner is smudged
[21:32:05] <solarflares> solar 2 is pretty cool i just played it
[21:32:07] <solarflares> i got to neutron star
[21:33:30] <gnarf> coldhead: best part of the conf for me
[21:33:53] <gnarf> ajpiano discovered this bug: http://jqbug.com/154
[21:34:25] <tw2113> old bug is old
[21:34:45] <gnarf> old song written by john resig is amazing tho
[21:35:03] <tw2113> i kind of wish i knew enough js/jquery to know when a bug is a bug
[21:36:43] <gnarf> also http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13220#comment:5 http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13214#comment:6 --- we got called fuckers and fuckheads back to back days...
[21:37:21] <coldhead> that's hilarious
[21:37:24] <coldhead> you fuckheads
[21:37:28] <LocalPCGuy> haha..nice
[21:38:11] <tw2113> never please everyone
[21:38:12] <coldhead> If I had known for just one second
[21:38:13] <coldhead> you'd have trouble with "A dot 3".
[21:38:18] <coldhead> that is so good
[21:38:18] <tw2113> tell them to stick on 1.8-
[21:38:22] <coldhead> thank you for sharing gnarf
[21:38:22] <phonebook_> like none of you have ever been on bath salts and decided to make public comments about jquery or the W3C?
[21:39:02] <phonebook_> your css is so bad im going to eat your face. immortalized
[21:39:02] <gnarf> coldhead: i was sold at "kept thinking i could never live with that bug in dot find"
[21:39:54] <tw2113> time to couch code for a bit
[21:39:55] <tw2113> brb
[21:40:07] <gnarf> oh and some audience member during dave's keynote asked if we had any plans to merge jquery core aand mobile and also get core down to a saner footprint, like 7k
[21:40:30] <tw2113> remove ie hacks
[21:40:36] <tw2113> oh wait, 2.0
[21:40:42] <gnarf> tw2113: still only 22k ;)
[21:41:13] <gnarf> though it is smaller than the size of the average high pixel density icon file
[21:41:21] <coldhead> "do you have any plans to do things which are not actually possible in this universe?"
[21:41:22] <tw2113> damn retina
[21:41:33] <LocalPCGuy> gnarf or boostrap, which people have no problem adding willynilly
[21:42:09] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: the funny thing is, for every loud complaint you hear like that, there are like 1,000 people using it and never having any problems
[21:42:10] <phonebook_> imo jquery mobile and jquery ui aren't even in the ame league as actual jquery.
[21:42:18] <LocalPCGuy> yup
[21:42:21] <gnarf> phonebook_: UI is pretty damn solid
[21:42:34] <gnarf> phonebook_: and mobile is a different kind of framework, and getting there pretty quickly
[21:43:22] <phonebook_> theyre good
[21:43:30] <fonko> how do i know how many object does a var have inside? my var has lots of json objects
[21:43:37] <fonko> var.lenght?
[21:43:38] <gnarf> phonebook_: interactions (drag, drop, sortable, resize, etc) and datepicker are like the last "bad" parts :)
[21:44:01] <Cork> fonko: you can't know the number of properties in an object, except through counting them
[21:44:01] <gnarf> fonko: is it an array?
[21:44:05] <LocalPCGuy> gnarf funny, the thing I've probably used the most from UI was draggable/droppable
[21:44:34] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: yeah, you'll love the rewrite
[21:44:45] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: you should hang around ui-dev and help test out interactions branch ;)
[21:45:07] <gnarf> new branch should support touch for those interactions too
[21:45:13] <fonko> its an array
[21:45:14] <gnarf> also pointerevents
[21:45:14] <fonko> yup
[21:45:21] <gnarf> fonko: then yes, .length is length
[21:45:25] <coldhead> our exquisite replica of eternity
[21:45:27] <LocalPCGuy> oh, that will be cool.
[21:45:34] <LocalPCGuy> jqueryui-dev?
[21:45:39] <gnarf> LocalPCGuy: yeah
[21:45:42] <gnarf> `channels
[21:45:43] <fonko> nice
[21:45:48] <gnarf> ?channels
[21:45:49] <bot-t> For support please go to #jquery | Development Channels: #jquery-dev - #jqueryui-dev - #jquerymobile-dev - #jquery-content | All Meetings held in#jquery-meeting http://jquery.org/meeting
[21:46:48] <fonko> anyway i dont know why isn't working
[21:46:51] <fonko> i have this function
[21:46:52] <fonko> http://pastebin.com/AhHiqc0S
[21:47:27] <fonko> when execute this function im waiting for newcontent to have lots of divs with my json's array info but instead of that is says "undefined"
[21:47:41] <Cork> fonko: where does members come from, its not in that function
[21:47:43] <LocalPCGuy> in about a week the website I used draggable/droppable on should be online, but not sure I'll share...the JS is pretty ugly and I really want to rewrite it
[21:47:48] <LocalPCGuy> :P
[21:48:07] <LocalPCGuy> been through a few hands now
[21:48:13] <coldhead> just say someone on your team ruined it, LocalPCGuy
[21:48:17] <coldhead> and take credit for the good parts
[21:48:19] <coldhead> that's what i do
[21:48:19] <fonko> yup, its outside the function
[21:48:20] <LocalPCGuy> oh yah...
[21:49:02] <fonko> and it has a huge json like [object, onject, obect, object] each of them have "nombre:something", "email:something" etc
[21:49:28] <fonko> if i go members[1]['nombre'] in my console i successfully get what im expecting
[21:49:33] <LocalPCGuy> fonko why aren't you passing it to the function as a parameter?
[21:49:43] <fonko> but if i go newcontent it says undefined
[21:49:45] <gnarf> fonko: $.each( members, function( index, member ) {...});
[21:49:59] <gnarf> `api jQuery.each
[21:49:59] <b-ot> gnarf: jQuery.each(): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[21:50:22] <fonko> mmm i shuld check that gnarf, thanks
[21:51:07] <fonko> wait, what are you suggesting gnarf ? to use that inside my function?
[21:51:20] <gnarf> fonko: rather than the for loop, yes
[21:51:31] <ezio> can anyone access http://209.195.121.135:5280/test
[21:51:52] <fonko> cool, thanks sr
[21:52:20] <coldhead> yes, it looks like some kind of form
[21:52:24] <coldhead> ?cc
[21:52:25] <b-ot> coldhead: CASE CLOASED >:|
[21:52:25] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[21:52:32] <coldhead> thanks bot-chorus
[21:52:42] * gnarf hugs b-ot
[21:52:49] * gnarf frowns
[21:53:01] <gnarf> rmill: make it work! :)
[21:53:09] * gnarf hugs bot-t
[21:53:10] * bot-t hugs gnarf back
[21:53:14] <gnarf> yay!
[21:53:26] <coldhead> b-ot hasn't been programmed to love
[21:53:29] <coldhead> it's very sad
[21:53:33] <coldhead> he can feel pain but not love
[21:53:35] <rmill> :>
[21:53:39] <Cork> gnarf: btw, do you know why we have so much duplications in b-ot and bot-t?
[21:53:40] <coldhead> like a woman, in certain respects
[21:53:42] <gnarf> Cork: she?
[21:53:51] <gnarf> Cork: yeah, because we are replacing bot-t
[21:53:54] <rmill> b-ot: Do you feel love?
[21:53:54] <b-ot> rmill: you may rely on it.
[21:53:55] <fonko> gnarf, still... should i use a var to get all my data looped inside or should i append all the data into the finall div?
[21:53:58] <coldhead> OVER MY DEAD BODY
[21:54:00] <gnarf> Cork: which is why i usually use `whatever now
[21:54:00] * Cork nods
[21:54:02] <Cork> thought so
[21:54:03] <rmill> b-ot: Do you feel pain?
[21:54:03] <b-ot> rmill: without a doubt.
[21:54:05] <gnarf> because thats only b-ot
[21:54:07] <phonebook_> im filling out the form. does it go nowhere?
[21:54:36] <gnarf> Cork: only thing really different is `api .... instead of just ?....
[21:54:43] <Cork> ah
[21:54:44] <ezio> can someone see if this is up http://209.195.121.135:5280/test
[21:54:57] <gnarf> `down http://209.195.121.135:5280/test
[21:54:57] <b-ot> gnarf: It's just you. http://209.195.121.135:5280/test is up! (301 Moved Permanently)
[21:55:03] <Cork> gnarf: well and that js> sucks compared to ?eval
[21:55:04] <phonebook_> it is up
[21:55:13] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[21:55:21] <Cork> <_<
[21:55:23] <gnarf> Cork: i'm sure rmill could show you how to help fix ;)
[21:55:31] <Cork> lol
[21:55:33] <rmill> Cork: What's so bad about it?
[21:55:42] <fonko> gnarf, http://pastebin.com/Lzax6DN0
[21:55:44] <rmill> It's sandboxed and uses ideone
[21:55:45] <Cork> for example
[21:55:49] <Cork> ?eval "hello"
[21:55:51] <bot-t> Cork: "hello"
[21:55:53] <Cork> js> "hello"
[21:55:54] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[21:56:01] <fonko> insted of http://pastebin.com/AhHiqc0S ?
[21:56:05] <rmill> js> print( 'hello' )
[21:56:08] <b-ot> rmill: hello
[21:56:08] <gnarf> js> return "hello"
[21:56:09] <Cork> ya i know
[21:56:13] <b-ot> gnarf: No output.
[21:56:18] <rmill> js> print( 2+2 )
[21:56:21] <b-ot> rmill: 4
[21:56:28] <gnarf> rmill: having to print() is kinda annoying
[21:56:31] <coldhead> +1 for Cork's case
[21:56:37] <gnarf> js> jQuery.fn.jquery
[21:56:39] <coldhead> fine, +2
[21:56:40] <b-ot> gnarf: No output.
[21:56:42] <Cork> another thing
[21:56:44] <solarflares> i looked at what i had typed into irc and it said
[21:56:45] <solarflares> im a goat
[21:56:46] <gnarf> js> print(jQuery.fn.jquery)
[21:56:48] <solarflares> but i dont remember
[21:56:49] <b-ot> gnarf: No output.
[21:56:51] <rmill> I mean, we could make it a REAL sandbox.
[21:56:59] <Cork> ?eval print("hello"); print(" world");
[21:56:59] <bot-t> Cork: "hello"" world"
[21:57:03] <Cork> js> print("hello"); print(" world");
[21:57:05] <rmill> The problem is, that plugin just uses ideone.
[21:57:06] <b-ot> Cork: hello  world
[21:57:08] <rmill> So it's SLOWWW
[21:57:15] <rmill> And their API kinda sorta sux
[21:57:26] <Cork> hmm so it handles two print now, it didn't a few days ago
[21:57:26] <gnarf> rmill: lets just node sandbox it and give it a jsdom / jquery
[21:57:29] <Cork> so scratch that one
[21:57:40] <gnarf> rmill: make `eval
[21:57:45] <gnarf> disable the other plugin
[21:57:46] <gnarf> ?
[21:57:54] <rmill> TIME
[21:57:56] <rmill> haha
[21:58:10] <gnarf> rmill: I can work on it maybe, poke me some day
[21:58:14] <rmill> gnarf: Are you aware of something that already exists?
[21:58:23] <gnarf> rmill: im pretty sure all these tools already work
[21:58:26] <Cork> ah, ya the fact that both don't have jquery is kinda weird :)
[21:58:37] <rmill> we could use Cheerio
[21:58:54] <rmill> but like, how to prevent process.exit() :D
[21:59:04] <gnarf> rmill: the eval should be loaded as a <script> in a dom
[21:59:32] <gnarf> rmill: we can sandbox in node
[21:59:37] <gnarf> rmill: it's not that hard
[21:59:43] <rmill> I know, I'm sure this has all been done before.
[21:59:59] <rmill> gnarf: Feel free to write a plugin?
[22:00:02] <gnarf> i'll track it down and try to get it running one of these adys
[22:00:16] <gnarf> rmill: is there a "writing a plugin" guide yet?
[22:00:28] <gnarf> and or a "setting up a test bot" guide?
[22:01:09] <rmill> Nope and nope :\
[22:01:27] <Cork> oh, ya would it be possible to get document working in the bot?
[22:01:32] <gnarf> rmill: could you write those maybe, then put me on the eval? :)
[22:01:56] <gnarf> i'll be the test case / revise your doc with any bumps i find
[22:02:37] <gnarf> Cork: https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/master/README.md
[22:03:17] <rmill> Cork, gnarf: feel free to join #irc-js
[22:03:27] <rmill> gnarf: This is all we have so far: http://irc-js.com/
[22:03:44] <rmill> Which is the actual IRC lib (not the bot :s)
[22:04:19] <Cork> gnarf: ah, looks quite a lot like dom.js :)
[22:04:32] <Cork> https://github.com/andreasgal/dom.js
[22:09:31] <solarflares> so this new viking show is pretty good
[22:10:35] <coldhead> finally, the viking show we deserve?
[22:15:37] <solarflares> its aite
[22:27:24] <coldhead> these are shark fins
[22:28:29] <Cork> *dun* *dun* *dun* *dun* :D
[22:29:05] <coldhead> i hear what you did there :D
[22:35:56] <gnarf> `k shark!
[22:35:56] <b-ot> gnarf: (s
[22:38:37] <raj> Cork, you know what we talked about yesterday?
[22:39:01] <Cork> vagely
[22:39:10] <raj> do you think that would be terrible for performance if there were 100,000 thumbnails?
[22:39:24] <raj> i'm talking about figuring out whether to have the ellipsis
[22:39:27] <Cork> ah the load thing?
[22:39:33] <raj> right
[22:40:24] <Cork> well the browser will open at max 3 connects to the server at one time
[22:40:35] <raj> why does the server have to be connected to?
[22:40:47] <Cork> so that means you would have ~ 60000 * load time for each image in delay
[22:40:49] <raj> oh to load the static resource
[22:42:34] <raj> and avg speed for thumbnail was 23ms
[22:43:51] <raj> but that's on my local server
[22:44:00] <Cork> ya
[22:44:21] <Cork> well thats the cost of having to fetch the image to know its dimensions
[22:44:40] <Cork> unless you implement an api to fetch the sizes before hand, there isn't really another way
[22:44:59] <raj> how is this any different than building the thumbnail anyway?
[22:45:01] <Cork> but that said if you have that many images, i would prob opt for that solution
[22:45:18] <raj> that's just transferring the onus serverside
[22:45:33] <Cork> not really, the server can do the calculation really fast
[22:45:36] <Cork> and it can cache it
[22:45:38] <raj> oh, but it's once
[22:45:47] <Cork> client side have to fetch the data before it knows
[22:46:05] <Cork> so if you ex. can do a json call and get the thumbnails and there dimentions
[22:46:21] <Cork> you wouldn't have to wait for the images to load, as you can just set width and height on the img tag
[22:46:27] <Cork> and then everything would just work
[22:47:25] <Cork> and ya, even better, the server could hold a small database with the file name and the dimensions
[22:47:33] <djQuery> not to mention the bandwidth charges for sending that many images to the client when they aren't going to view but a fraction of them
[22:47:37] <Cork> then it would be a small cost on upload and then no cost at all
[22:48:01] <Cork> ah, true
[22:48:15] <Cork> you prob would want to add an infinite scroll to that
[22:48:26] <Cork> so it only loads those that are visible + some
[22:49:27] <raj> would that solve everything Cork?
[22:49:35] <raj> to just load using infinite scroll?
[22:50:01] <Cork> it would reduce the load time, as you wouldn't have to wait for all the images to load
[22:50:13] <raj> but then it'll probably just do what it does now
[22:50:18] <raj> like, it'll look the same to the user
[22:50:23] <Cork> but you would still get a load time without storing the dimensions though
[22:50:27] <raj> they'll see the files appear at the same rate
[22:50:48] <Cork> well now your loading them all, and then render them locally
[22:50:52] <Cork> when they scroll
[22:50:58] <raj> if I store the dimensions, I still have load time, but the thumbnail portion will be blank while the rest of the thumb container sits ready in place
[22:51:03] <Cork> so it would differ a little if they scroll fast
[22:51:12] <Cork> ya
[22:51:24] <raj> hmm
[22:52:46] <raj> Cork, does it matter that the thumbnails have a max-width/max-height?
[22:52:53] <raj> ...the img, that is
[22:53:00] <Cork> not really
[22:53:02] <raj> the actual thumbnail images on the server
[22:53:44] <Cork> it just means that in some cases the width height on the img tag will be ignored cause they are too large
[22:55:48] <raj> also, I was hoping to allow users to zoom in the future
[22:56:01] <raj> to enlarge and reduce all the thumbnails at once
[22:56:03] <Cork> don't see how that matters
[22:56:15] <raj> if I store the thumbnail size
[22:56:21] <raj> the dimensions
[22:56:30] <raj> and then decide later to allow users to make it smaller or larger
[22:56:39] <raj> from a Select menu, perhaps
[22:57:05] <Cork> you mean to actually change the size of the image?
[22:57:10] <raj> it'll have to recalculate how many characters fit
[22:57:13] <Cork> not just scale in in the browser?
[22:57:30] <raj> no, scale using css I suppose
[22:57:33] <raj> by adding a class
[22:57:45] <raj> .zoom-0
[22:57:48] <raj> .zoom-1
[22:57:49] <raj> .zoom-2
[22:57:50] <Cork> depends a bit on how you scale it
[22:58:00] <Cork> but no shouldn't be too much of a problem
[22:58:11] <Cork> transform for example
[22:58:17] <raj> but how would I then calculate how many characters fit?
[22:58:48] <Cork> you mean for the infinite scroll?
[22:59:08] <Cork> btw chacacters?
[22:59:14] <Cork> are you using images for text??
[22:59:18] <raj> no
[22:59:21] <coldhead> var count = prompt("How many characters are there in: " + str);
[22:59:39] <coldhead> mechanical turkish prison solution
[23:00:48] <raj> considered it, not good for internationalization, ironically
[23:01:13] <Cork> its horrible for accessibility too
[23:06:45] <raj> so Cork saving thumbnail width/height solves everything?
[23:07:08] <Cork> raj: no, but it solves the need to wait for the image to load
[23:07:18] <Cork> it solves nothing else
[23:07:19] <raj> ok
[23:07:24] <raj> understood
[23:07:36] <raj> that's like 1/2 or 1/3 the problem though
[23:08:02] <raj> the other half is having to go through the while loop to figure out ellipsis
[23:08:27] <Cork> well you don't
[23:08:43] <raj> what do you mean?
[23:08:44] <Cork> if you set the size on the img tag as you add them, when thats done you just have to check
[23:09:07] <Cork> the reason you had the delay before was cause you had to wait for the image to load to know its dimensions
[23:09:29] <Cork> just adding a tag with a specific size will make that unneeded
[23:09:51] <raj> got it
[23:12:14] <raj> last question, I hope, what would I do if I add the ability to "zoom into the thumbnail"?
[23:12:24] <raj> or, want to
[23:12:35] <raj> like just set a different height/width on the <img>
[23:12:40] <raj> using a class
[23:13:01] <raj> I would have to re-evaluate each <p> again?
[23:13:33] <raj> (cuz this is how I assume zooming works--> 02:12 < raj> like just set a different height/width on the <img>
[23:13:36] <raj> )
[23:14:16] <Cork> well you can't set a new height/width through css, that would change there dimension
[23:14:34] <Cork> and ya you would have to recheck the parent element
[23:22:22] <raj> so how would I set a new height/width?
[23:22:23] <raj> canvas?
[23:26:53] <Cork> raj: well if the images have different size you would have to update the dimensions separately on each element
[23:29:53] <BkaT> if i'm passing data with $.get( 'foo.php', { usersearch: variable }, function(...) ), wouldn't you access that in PHP with $_GET['username']?
[23:30:10] <BkaT> errr, $_GET['usersearch']
[23:30:14] <Cork> yes
[23:30:20] <Cork> you would
[23:30:56] <BkaT> thought so. i get an undefined index error for the get superglobal though. is using a variable for the object literal legal?
[23:31:22] <BkaT> for the object literal in $.get, to be more specific
[23:31:22] <Cork> what do you mean?
[23:31:52] <Cork> if you don't find it do a var_dump($_GET);
[23:32:11] <BkaT> just to see what it actually is?
[23:32:56] <Cork> well unless something removes the data, it should be there
[23:33:15] <BkaT> well the variable comes from an input field
[23:33:36] <BkaT> but i'm clearly typing something into said field
[23:33:46] <Cork> you might want to check serialize()
[23:33:56] <raj> what's it called when html5 things have fallbacks?
[23:33:58] <Cork> if you have more then one element you need data from
[23:34:05] <raj> that js solves
[23:34:08] <BkaT> not so far
[23:34:24] <Cork> BkaT: are you sending the element or .val() on it?
[23:34:48] <Cork> raj: fallback, or feature detection
[23:35:26] <raj> there's another word for it
[23:35:37] <BkaT> that variable, in the original example, comes from a $('#foo').val();
[23:35:39] <Cork> shim?
[23:36:12] <BkaT> that's the correct way right?
[23:36:17] <Cork> BkaT: ok, then ya, check that the data is really sent (the browsers network console)
[23:36:21] <Cork> BkaT: yes
[23:38:00] <BkaT> Cork: i can see the xml, urlescaped i'm assuming, in the response
[23:38:06] <BkaT> but the XML tab throws an error
[23:38:16] <BkaT> which comes from the PHP file
[23:38:23] <Cork> BkaT: no in the request, not the response
[23:38:27] <BkaT> because it isn't generating XML
[23:38:46] <BkaT> you mean the headers?
[23:39:47] <BkaT> oooooh
[23:39:55] <BkaT> could it be because i'm using htmlentities() in PHP?
[23:40:21] <Cork> not necessarily
[23:40:29] <Cork> it depends on what you send, and what your client expect
[23:41:18] <BkaT> the headers seem to be fine
[23:41:42] <Cork> BkaT: no not the header
[23:42:02] <Cork> for a get request the data is at the end of the url
[23:42:37] <BkaT> ooooh
[23:43:42] <BkaT> yeah it says 'GET foo.php?usersearch=bar'
[23:43:49] <Cork> BkaT: there param should be listed separately too
[23:44:00] <Cork> but that might depend on the browser
[23:44:11] <Cork> BkaT: ok, so the problem is server side
[23:44:13] <BkaT> yeah i see it in the params tab
[23:44:18] <BkaT> right
[23:44:24] <BkaT> that makes sense
[23:44:33] <raj> k, goodnight Cork :)
[23:44:33] <BkaT> heres my theory
[23:44:42] <Cork> bye O/
[23:45:09] <BkaT> actually there is no theory
[23:45:21] <BkaT> PHP says usersearch is an undefined indesx
[23:45:23] <BkaT> index
[23:46:34] <Cork> BkaT: have you checked the dump yet?
[23:46:46] <BkaT> no, i'll do it now
[23:47:12] <BkaT> so just var_dump($_GET) right?
[23:48:26] <BkaT> wait, where do i put that if i'm getting the data from JS?
