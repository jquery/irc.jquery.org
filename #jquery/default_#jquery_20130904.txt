[00:00:07] <doug65536> Cork: yeah. I'm writing unit tests for my sites ajax api (authentication stuff) and it would be nice to be able to write them without yet another document.cookie parser or having to use a plugin
[00:01:42] <doug65536> maybe the right thing to do is add an ajax request that checks whether I am authenticated, instead of hacks with the session cookie
[00:02:20] <Cork> or to make an ajax call to log you in correctly
[00:08:10] <wilufa> hello.I
[00:10:00] <wilufa> i
[00:12:25] <doug65536> lol
[00:13:48] <Ardy> Hello
[00:14:34] <Ardy> anyone here i need help
[00:14:35] <Ardy> xD
[00:14:48] <doug65536> yes someone is always here
[00:15:02] <Cork> ?ask
[00:15:02] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:15:22] <Ardy> :D k
[00:16:40] <DrkShadow> So, I have a radio button, and I put a .change(func) on it. This fires when the radio is _selected_ but not when the radio is _deselected_. How can I make it do both?
[00:17:03] <Cork> DrkShadow: you bind it on all the radio elements
[00:17:12] <DrkShadow> Cork: that really, really sucks.
[00:17:15] <Cork> DrkShadow: when one is selected all the other are deselected
[00:17:20] <Cork> DrkShadow: not really
[00:17:29] <Ardy> i m have a problem with funcition append and form, i have a button that add new input with append function, but when i submit i don't show the variable with var_dum($_POST), i see only the static element
[00:17:30] <Cork> should work find if you use delegate
[00:17:45] <doug65536> DrkShadow: if it worked your way then people would have to deal with ignoring the deselected one
[00:18:01] <Cork> Ardy: make sure you append the input elements with name in the form
[00:18:01] <DrkShadow> doug: I'm asking for _change_, not _select_.
[00:19:06] <Cork> Ardy: if the input element doesn't have an unique name, it won't be in the post, i suspect that is your problem
[00:19:31] <Ardy> Cork: yes i add with array name like id[] ... but the problem is in the tag </form > i don't understand why but end when he want
[00:19:56] <Cork> Ardy: validate your html
[00:20:01] <Ardy> when i check with dev tools chrome the tag close random :s
[00:20:14] <Cork> Ardy: it doesn't
[00:21:52] <DrkShadow> I'm watching the DOM for a radio button with id #blahblah's change -- on select, highlight some text; on deselect, remove the highlight. What's the best way to do that? :-/
[00:23:13] <Cork> DrkShadow: $('parent').on('click', 'input[type="radio"]', function() {})
[00:23:29] <Cork> and then check $(this).val()
[00:23:47] <Andrew_> that... really sucks.
[00:24:27] <Cork> don't really see what's so sucky about it
[00:24:50] <Ardy> Cork: do u have teamviewer just for a sec
[00:24:58] <Cork> nope
[00:25:14] <Andrew_> cork: my id isn't linked to the name of the radio button. There may be multiple id's in the radio group. Basically I would have to loop over all of my data to determine if something was deselected, _and_ I would have to know that it _was_ selected to begin with.
[00:25:45] <Cork> Andrew_: so set the id on the group
[00:26:06] <Cork> check the name of the radio and then the avlue
[00:26:06] <Cork> *value
[00:26:17] <Andrew_> cork: when I'm highlighting text depending on the _selected_ option, that doesn't work. Checking the value is the same issue just described.
[00:26:51] <Cork> Andrew_: then you are building a broken form
[00:26:54] <Andrew_> uh huh.. right.
[00:27:03] <Cork> Andrew_: if the value on the name of the radio doesn't idenitfy the option
[00:27:07] <Cork> it wouldn't work in a form
[00:28:23] <doug65536> Andrew_: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Sd8TY/2/
[00:29:20] <Cork> doug65536: use .val() instead of attr('value')
[00:29:20] <doug65536> oops hold on
[00:29:37] <Andrew_> doug: suppose you had resultA, resultB, and resultC. Then you want to hide or show the correct group depending on whether A, B, or C is checked.
[00:30:10] <Cork> Andrew_: have a generic class to hide everything, then build a class based on the value in the selected option
[00:30:30] <Cork> Andrew_: after you have hidden everything show the class based on the value from the option
[00:30:45] <Cork> should be simple and actually very little code
[00:30:56] <Andrew_> Cork: so the magical "if you did that, then you'd have to _ignore_ the one that isn't selected!" is resolved by "Loop over every radio button in the page and compare against every id in the data set..."
[00:30:57] <Cork> i've done it my self several times
[00:30:57] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Sd8TY/8/
[00:31:11] <Cork> Andrew_: no
[00:31:19] <Cork> Andrew_: no loop needed
[00:31:37] <Cork> though the solution doug65536 generated is based around loops
[00:31:46] <Cork> $(this).val() should be all you need
[00:32:27] <Cork> ex. $('.groups-' + this.name).hide(); $('.groups-type-' + $(this).val()).show()
[00:32:50] <Cork> those two lines should handle any number of option and option groups
[00:33:07] <Andrew_> I need to know which radio was previously selected. I can't "deselect" everything, because group B members may be selected my more than one choice in group A. How do you use JSFiddle?
[00:33:30] <doug65536> Cork: yes but I have the same handler for them all, so $(this) could be anything
[00:33:42] <Cork> doug65536: ya, that is the point
[00:33:51] <Cork> doug65536: that's why i used this.name
[00:34:09] <Cork> build the logic in classes, instead of in the code
[00:34:25] <doug65536> Cork: yes, but that way I would need data to hold state across changes. my way just gets it all on the fly
[00:34:29] <Cork> make the code generic and let the elements tell what they are
[00:34:30] <Ardy> Cork: i check with validator and i find the mistake :D
[00:34:38] <Cork> doug65536: no
[00:35:09] <Cork> doug65536: the state is managed by the classes
[00:35:24] <doug65536> Cork: but this doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Sd8TY/9/
[00:35:47] <Cork> doug65536: yes, cause you statically use the values
[00:35:55] <Cork> instead of dynamically find it from the element
[00:36:26] <doug65536> Cork: again, what you are suggesting would require me to hold state outside the callback across calls, right?
[00:36:33] <Cork> no
[00:36:42] <Cork> like i said the classes holds the state
[00:37:41] <doug65536> like this? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/Sd8TY/11/
[00:37:56] <Cork> sigh
[00:37:57] <Cork> no
[00:38:56] <doug65536> Cork: in what classes?
[00:39:00] <doug65536> write a class?
[00:39:14] <Cork> doug65536: well in your example you generate the content in js, so it is a bad example
[00:39:24] <Cork> doug65536: but have the content in html instead
[00:39:47] <Cork> then control what is visible through setting classes on an element or a oarent
[00:39:51] <doug65536> Cork: yes well I am focusing on the question: getting the selected radio button values, not a pretty display
[00:39:51] <Cork> *parent
[00:40:25] <Cork> doug65536: your trying to solve the question instead of the problem
[00:40:43] <Cork> doug65536: the point is if you restructure the problem you can solve it cleanly
[00:41:09] <doug65536> Cork: that's because I was unable to mind-read what he was going to do with the selections
[00:41:32] <Cork> ex. .group1.group2.group3 { display: block; } .group1.group2:not(.groupA { display: none; }
[00:41:48] <Cork> doug65536: well he did explain what he tries to do
[00:42:07] <Cork> and that is why i said he goes around it in a way that makes it hard
[00:42:25] <Andrew_> http://jsfiddle.net/Sd8TY/17/
[00:42:28] <Andrew_> I need deselect.
[00:42:42] <Cork> if you keep the display logic out of js, and just lets js control the states
[00:42:47] <Cork> it makes life a LOT easier
[00:43:03] <Andrew_> Modifying other people's code doesn't permit for rewriting crap code.
[00:43:28] <Andrew_> Even so, I cosidered assigning a class to the element. Same issue with removing the class.
[00:44:46] <ph88> you wanna put display logic in template ?
[00:54:02] <thump_> hi, for strings should one be using === for comparison?
[00:54:37] <Cork> thump_: === is fine as long as you don't risk doing cross type compare
[00:54:50] <Cork> like '1' === 1
[00:56:11] <thump_> Cork: I can see that would be a problem. I know it's definately a string as want it to be more secure by using  === instead of ==
[00:56:50] <Cork> thump_: then use === if you want to not allow type casting
[00:57:59] <thump_> Cork: thanks
[01:13:02] <aMoniker> Why would $.parseXML drop tags? They seem to be formatted correctly, but they're all missing from the result.
[01:13:26] <Cork> ?p @ aMoniker
[01:13:39] <Cork> sigh stupid freaking bots...
[01:13:47] <Cork> aMoniker: jsfiddle.net
[01:14:27] <aMoniker> Cork: do you know why parseXML might do that though?
[01:14:45] <Cork> that was why i asked you to make a textcase
[01:14:59] <aMoniker> I'm asking if you know that method well enough to know why it drops tags.
[02:10:33] <ksm> Hello guys
[02:11:21] <ksm> having trouble with a very simple jquery thing, can someone help, please ? ( http://jsfiddle.net/Ytgh5/ )
[02:12:43] <faraway> ksm 'myDiv'  is not a jquery object/resultset  it is just a string
[02:13:20] <faraway> ksm: $('#d'+i+' p:last') you want to have this
[02:14:01] <faraway> ?
[02:14:02] <ksm> I want i++ so then the object becomes #d1 / #d2 etc...
[02:15:43] <ksm> Ok, thanks, didn't know I could write it that way :)
[02:18:15] <faraway> ksm: hmmm .. probably you should learn javascript before using jquery ;) ….   $('#d'+i+' p:last') mean you call the function $ and pass there parameter '#d'+i+' p:last' …. but you created a string that looked like a function call with that parameter
[02:20:02] <ksm> Thanks faraway , indeed I'd need to dig javascript to save time ;)
[02:24:23] <faraway> ksm: well you should really know the fundamentals  (scoping, async function calls, prototypes, ...) of js otherwise you will most likely have big problems once your code grows.
[02:25:02] <jop008> Chrome question how to disable grid lines ? Go to chrome://flags/ and disable Composited Render Layer Borders.
[02:25:10] <jop008> I can find out how
[02:25:39] <ksm> faraway, I know, I've been using Jquery for quite a while now and it worked fine because I used simple things, now I'm trying to make somthing bigger, better not mess up from the beginning already
[02:28:43] <ksm> Thanks for helping, have a good day, Jqueries
[02:29:47] <slax0r> jop008, what's there more to find out? write chrome://flags instead of your url, and find "Composited Render Layer Borders" and disable it
[02:30:07] <fhds> $(function() {}) and this $(function() {})() the same thing that is invocation?
[02:30:42] <Cork> fhds: no, hte second one won't work at all
[02:30:46] <Cork> *the
[02:33:56] <fhds> Cork: parenthesis around jQuery object is the call of that?
[02:34:11] <kvarley-work> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6802283/jquery-appending-to-ajax-loaded-svg-problem This example isn't working for me, results in a 404 error because of the " svg" part of the get URL. any ideas?
[02:34:35] <Cork> fhds: $(function() {}) is the same as $(document).ready(function() {})
[02:34:57] <Cork> fhds: the second one will fail as jquery doens't return a function
[02:35:05] <Cork> (that you gave that is
[02:35:06] <Cork> )
[02:35:29] <Sep1> Hi guys, I'm trying to retrieve some data that are accessible through JSON. On the Github page to this feature is written "jQuery users: look under event.originalEvent)" - however, I cannot find a way how to use it. Could you give me, please, an example of how to use this event? I am working in jQuery just with the basic functions.
[02:35:31] <Sep1> so far
[02:35:33] <Cork> fhds: a second structure is (function() {})() and (function() {}())
[02:35:43] <Cork> fhds: though that has nothing to do with $()
[02:38:29] <Cork> Sep1: use what event?
[02:39:09] <Sep1> Cork: this one: event.originalEvent
[02:39:23] <Cork> what does that have to do with json?
[02:40:21] <equinox_> hi everyone, I have a button that triggers a registration popup
[02:40:30] <equinox_> after the user has successfully registered
[02:40:34] <equinox_> I want to do something
[02:40:56] <equinox_> how can I write a completion handler
[02:40:56] <equinox_> with the .trigger('click');
[02:41:04] <equinox_> is it possible?
[02:41:07] <Sep1> Cork: because there is written that I should use that event (event.originalEvent) and inside this event I should pull those data from JSON
[02:41:17] <Sep1> but I don't know how to call that event
[02:41:35] <Cork> Sep1: are you using some plugin that is doing something?
[02:41:46] <Sep1> Cork no
[02:41:56] <Cork> then i don't see what json has to do with events
[02:42:28] <Cork> equinox_: "want to do something"?
[02:42:35] <Sep1> Cork ok, maybe I described it in a little complicated way. Anyhow, how can I run that event?
[02:42:39] <equinox_> Cork: ?
[02:42:47] <Cork> equinox_: if you want to do something when something happens in the popup, you need to bind it to the elements in the popup
[02:43:31] <Cork> Sep1: if you want to fetch json from a server you do $.getJSON(url).done(function(json) { /* work with the object parsed from json */ });
[02:43:47] <Cork> Sep1: your question doesn't make sense so can't answer
[02:43:52] <Cork> Sep1: there is no events for json
[02:44:18] <Sep1> Cork I am sorry, I probably asked incorrectly. How can I call that event?
[02:44:26] <Cork> what event?
[02:44:37] <Sep1> this event in jQuery: event.originalEvent
[02:44:38] <Cork> you talk about two things that isn't related
[02:44:43] <equinox_> I think looking at the code
[02:44:45] <equinox_> makes more sense
[02:44:46] <equinox_> http://pastebin.com/9xk46shu
[02:45:16] <equinox_> addComment is a backbone function, essentially when the user is not logged in I do $('.popup.register').trigger('click');
[02:45:21] <equinox_> which then triggers the popup right
[02:45:28] <equinox_> the method below that is $('#registerSubmit').click(function(){
[02:45:42] <equinox_> this is called when the user hits register
[02:45:45] <equinox_> and it has a success handler
[02:45:51] <equinox_> basically inside this success handler
[02:46:06] <equinox_> I want to report back to addComment telling 'hey I am now logged in, you can now post comment'
[02:46:09] <equinox_> how do I do that?
[02:46:16] <Cork> you can't
[02:46:29] <equinox_> well then how can I do this ?
[02:46:34] <Cork> you would have to have a public function and have it called from the event handler
[02:46:47] <Cork> optionally you could pass a callback to the event through trigger
[02:46:57] <equinox_> yes
[02:47:00] <equinox_> that's actually what I want
[02:47:05] <equinox_> a callback to the event through trigger
[02:47:09] <equinox_> but don't know the code to do that
[02:47:31] <equinox_> I've been googling around for trigger callbacks
[02:47:36] <equinox_> but didn't find any example
[02:47:42] <Cork> equinox_: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[02:47:54] <Cork> the extraParameters section
[02:48:48] <Cork> though remember you will get one callback call for each event listening on the evnet
[02:48:50] <Cork> *event
[02:49:12] <Cork> at least from each listning to it and calling the callback
[02:49:16] <equinox_> so I'd have to trigger an event in the success block
[02:49:18] <equinox_> right?
[02:50:10] <Cork> event.data[0]() for example
[02:50:12] <equinox_> should I just do  $(this).trigger('register-complete');
[02:50:21] <Cork> no trigger isn't what you want
[02:50:28] <equinox_> hmmm
[02:50:28] <equinox_> so?
[02:50:33] <equinox_> sorry it's getting confusing
[02:50:36] <Cork> it's from where you do trigger('click', [function() {}])
[02:51:20] <equinox_> ahh
[02:51:21] <equinox_> okay
[02:51:40] <equinox_> so when will the code inside the function get called?
[02:52:03] <Cork> equinox_: when you call the function
[02:52:11] <equinox_> I guess the question is
[02:52:15] <equinox_> how do I call the function
[02:52:23] <equinox_> from that success block
[02:52:52] <equinox_> a little bit confused about callbacks
[02:52:53] <equinox_> sorry
[02:53:06] <Cork> equinox_: it is the second argument to the click handler
[02:54:29] <Cork> equinox_: $().on('click', function(event, callback) { if(callback !== undefined) { callback(); } }); $().trigger('click', [function() {  }])
[02:54:35] <Cork> remember that callback will only exist when you trigger it with trigger() though
[02:54:45] <Cork> so you need to check if it's undefined, for normal clicks
[02:54:48] <equinox_> okay
[02:54:50] <equinox_> let me try tht
[02:55:48] <equinox_> oh wait
[02:55:55] <equinox_> but basically
[02:56:16] <equinox_> this means
[02:56:18] <equinox_> that when I click
[02:56:21] <equinox_> on the registerButton
[02:56:30] <equinox_> it will call the callback function
[02:56:33] <equinox_> which is not what i want
[02:56:36] <Cork> no
[02:56:42] <Cork> cause callback will be undefined like i said
[02:56:46] <Cork> you need to check for that
[02:56:51] <titii> Hi. This chaining with show() doesnt works? $('#admin-upload-card-ec').removeClass('expand').addClass('collapse').show()
[02:56:58] <equinox_> so when will callback be defined?
[02:57:07] <equinox_> can you give context based on the paste bin that i have
[02:57:14] <Cork> equinox_: when you call trigger()
[02:57:29] <equinox_> I get it that my code now looks like this
[02:57:31] <equinox_> $('.popup.register').trigger('click', [function() {
[02:57:32] <equinox_> 				//add a completion handler here that gets called when the user has logged in
[02:57:32] <Cork> titii: what isn't working about it?
[02:57:33] <equinox_> 				
[02:57:34] <equinox_> 			}]));
[02:57:40] <equinox_> right?
[02:57:50] <titii> Cork: the show doenst appear
[02:57:59] <Cork> equinox_: an extra parantesis there but other then that yes
[02:58:22] <Cork> titii: then check so you don't have something overriding it
[02:58:29] <Cork> titii: and that the id exists
[02:58:31] <equinox_> Cork: but then
[02:58:34] <Cork> (and only once)
[02:58:34] <equinox_> inside my success handler
[02:58:43] <equinox_> I should have something that triggers the callback
[02:58:59] <Cork> yes that is the if undefined thingy i gave you before
[02:59:10] <Cork> if not undefined rather
[03:00:51] <equinox_> Cork: one last thing http://pastebin.com/vv3V8dHp
[03:00:59] <equinox_> can you check if that's what we've been looking for
[03:01:01] <titii> Cork: thank u
[03:01:20] <Cork> equinox_: it is what i explained yes
[03:02:42] <equinox_> Cork: but popup. register here triggers the modal/form
[03:02:42] <equinox_> not the click
[03:02:56] <Cork> what?
[03:03:12] <equinox_> Cork: you see $('.popup.register')
[03:03:17] <equinox_> that opens up a form
[03:03:21] <equinox_> that has a register button
[03:03:22] <Cork> ya?
[03:03:23] <equinox_> inside it
[03:03:42] <equinox_> so how does $('#registerSubmit') knows
[03:03:47] <equinox_> the callback function
[03:03:56] <equinox_> it is not passed anywhere
[03:04:05] <Cork> sure it is, on line 1
[03:06:08] <equinox_> I just tried the code and it didn't work
[03:06:12] <equinox_> call back is undefined
[03:08:45] <equinox_> Cork: ?
[03:09:11] <Cork> equinox_: callback('works');
[03:09:13] <Cork> opps
[03:09:18] <equinox_> ...
[03:09:19] <Cork> equinox_: http://jsfiddle.net/78mZD/1/
[03:09:52] <equinox_> yes
[03:09:55] <equinox_> this is not what I meant
[03:10:05] <Cork> you wanted a callback from the click event
[03:10:25] <equinox_> on your example
[03:10:26] <equinox_> it's clear
[03:10:32] <equinox_> the div trigger a click
[03:10:35] <equinox_> and then you have a handler
[03:10:37] <equinox_> on click
[03:10:41] <equinox_> that calls the handler
[03:10:47] <Cork> actually it is the other way around but fine
[03:11:11] <equinox_> why does every time I click on the blue square
[03:11:13] <equinox_> it gives an alert
[03:11:15] <equinox_> undefined
[03:12:25] <Cork> equinox_: http://jsfiddle.net/78mZD/2/
[03:13:24] <equinox_> this is not exactly like my use case
[03:13:35] <Cork> it is very close
[03:13:42] <equinox_> imagine if you click on the trigger button
[03:13:45] <Cork> you do trigger from addComment (the button)
[03:13:45] <equinox_> a form pops up
[03:14:01] <equinox_> the user fills out the form
[03:14:02] <equinox_> and then
[03:14:05] <equinox_> pushes register
[03:14:14] <equinox_> my register
[03:14:16] <equinox_> is similar to $('div').on('click'
[03:14:21] <Cork> uh
[03:14:31] <Cork> you submit a form through click?!?
[03:14:38] <Cork> it's a bad start just there
[03:14:41] <Bish> is there a clean way to detect a change of top.location.href ?
[03:14:56] <Cork> Bish: in newer browsers yes, older no
[03:15:05] <aMoniker> Does jquery have a way to generate an arbitrary XML element?
[03:15:08] <Bish> Cork, how?
[03:15:11] <equinox_> Cork: well that's another story
[03:15:21] <aMoniker> In the same way that you could use $('<foo>bar</foo>')
[03:15:25] <aMoniker> but for XML
[03:15:33] <Cork> Bish: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.onhashchange
[03:15:54] <Bish> Cork, i know about that function, im talking about the whole location, not just the hash
[03:15:58] <Cork> equinox_: well then the click has nothing to do with the original event
[03:16:08] <equinox_> I know
[03:16:09] <Cork> equinox_: and the only other option you have is a public callback
[03:16:20] <equinox_> so how do I do a public callback
[03:16:23] <Bish> Cork, facebook seems to be changing the top.location.href while surpressing the pagechange..
[03:16:47] <Cork> equinox_: ex add a function to the element through .data('my-plugin-callback', function() {})
[03:16:49] <equinox_> Cork: if you can jsfiddle that
[03:16:50] <Cork> and then call it
[03:16:52] <equinox_> that'd be awesome
[03:18:05] <Cork> Bish: pagechange? you mean statechange?
[03:18:29] <Bish> Cork, well... they seem to load the whole page which ajax, while their url changes, without having a complete reload..
[03:18:45] <equinox_> Cork: ?
[03:18:57] <Bish> and i want to detect those url changes.. but i can't, no onpopstate, no hashchange
[03:19:26] <Cork> Bish: then they most likely kill those events
[03:19:36] <Cork> and then you don't really have a clean way to do it
[03:19:43] <Bish> :( can i do something about that? :(
[03:19:47] <Cork> not relly
[03:19:54] <Bish> that sucks
[03:20:05] <equinox_> Cork: why can't i create a custom event
[03:20:09] <equinox_> and fire off that custom event
[03:20:10] <equinox_> on success
[03:20:13] <equinox_> and have a handler
[03:20:22] <equinox_> when that event is fired
[03:20:45] <Cork> equinox_: you can but i don't see what the point is of fireing events that you only care about on one place
[03:20:58] <Bish> but im writing a chrome plugin, which means i have my complete own javascript environment, does that help somehow?
[03:21:03] <Cork> equinox_: events is good if you have one source and potentially many listeners
[03:21:24] <Cork> equinox_: but it is overly costly if you have one trigger and ever only one listener
[03:21:26] <equinox_> Cork: so then can you show me a fiddle of the public callback
[03:21:27] <Cork> then a callback is better
[03:21:41] <Trical> is there a reason why location.href ="page.html"; would not work in bootstrap?
[03:21:46] <Cork> equinox_: i gave you a solution where you use data() stead
[03:22:06] <equinox_> Cork: I've never used data
[03:22:13] <Cork> Trical: only thing i can think of is if you trigger it too early or something
[03:22:25] <Cork> equinox_: then read up on it in api.jquery.com
[03:24:01] <equinox_> Cork: data is just for storing data for a particular dom element
[03:24:03] <equinox_> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[03:24:06] <equinox_> how does it help then?
[03:24:09] <Cork> uh.. yes
[03:24:37] <Cork> you attach the event on the or similar and then trigger it where you need it
[03:24:54] <equinox_> on the or?
[03:25:19] <equinox_> how do I trigger the function?
[03:25:29] <Cork> equinox_: think about it a few second and you should be able to figure it out from what we've talked about
[03:25:41] <Cork> i've already answered that
[03:27:21] <equinox_> erhmm
[03:27:24] <Trical> corck it's under an IF statement, and i'm sure it's being triggerd
[03:27:28] <equinox_> so this.data('my-plugin-callback', function() {
[03:27:28] <equinox_> 			});
[03:27:30] <equinox_> means that the DOM
[03:27:35] <equinox_> has a function that can be called
[03:27:41] <equinox_> which is called my-plugin-callback?
[03:28:01] <Cork> Trical: and you're sure the page has loaded when you trigger it?
[03:28:13] <Trical> yeah
[03:28:26] <equinox_> Cork: ?
[03:28:37] <Cork> Trical: then can't see what would prevent it
[03:30:01] <Trical> cork http://i.imgur.com/FLeXAQC.png
[03:30:16] <equinox_> wow
[03:30:20] <equinox_> data is more amazing than I knew
[03:30:24] <equinox_> it can store function
[03:30:29] <equinox_> at least i learned something new today
[03:30:40] <Cork> Trical: and your sure the line actually runs?
[03:30:51] <Trical> corck yes
[03:31:27] <Trical> corck i can see in the console, that if I log something in the if, it logs
[03:35:49] <equinox_> if I have multiple element with the same class, called 'my class' in a page
[03:36:09] <equinox_> when I do $('.myclass')
[03:36:13] <equinox_> which one will it give me

[03:47:57] <sharpy35> hey guys, is it possible to detect if xhr2 is supported which works in every browser?
[03:56:15] <uwjesq> Hello. If I use a canvas in a prettyphoto, the canvas stays blank. Help appreciated.
[03:59:05] <doug65536> equinox_: all of them
[04:00:06] <sharpy35> i havent found a solution yet thats works well in every browser :( does anybody know one?
[04:00:20] <doug65536> sharpy35: why not $.ajax
[04:01:34] <sharpy35> i am using $.ajax, but i am writing a function that works with xhrFields which are only supported with the XHR2. Though for older browsers i want to implement iFrame Transport  as a fallback
[04:01:53] <sharpy35> but therefore i need a secure detection which works in all browsers
[04:02:19] <sharpy35> the thing is, that i could test for browsers and browser versions, but that would be an overkill i guess
[04:02:54] <doug65536> sharpy35: what fields
[04:03:30] <sharpy35> xhrFields
[04:03:41] <sharpy35> check this post on github: https://gist.github.com/HenrikJoreteg/2502497
[04:04:06] <sharpy35> he is using xhrFields onprogress to send a realtime uploadprogress to the client
[04:05:39] <doug65536> sharpy35: if you want to show progress cross-browser, I would suggest doing it server side, and provide a way for your client to ask for progress information from the server
[04:06:47] <sharpy35> doug65536: thanks for the suggestion
[04:23:39] <RiFo> greetings, got a quick question about jquery selector. i got a div with an id like "text-abc:ab.d/d" and when i try to select it with $("#text-abc\\:ab\\.d/d") it fails with 'unrecognized expression'
[04:24:33] <doug65536> RiFo: is that legal?
[04:24:38] <RiFo> (basicly i added an urn to a div to make it unique, but now i can't select it)
[04:24:50] <doug65536> RiFo: what happens if you do document.getElementById("text-abc:ab.d/d")
[04:25:18] <doug65536> in the console
[04:25:45] <RiFo> that ruturns the div
[04:26:23] <RiFo> hm i might just use that, totatly forgot about it
[04:26:32] <RiFo> thanks
[04:27:24] <RiFo> ah nvm i can't use fadeout then ^^' (or any other effect)
[04:28:14] <doug65536> RiFo: I think funny characters have to be escaped as hex
[04:29:06] <doug65536> "text-abc\3aab\2ed\2fd"
[04:29:07] <RiFo> the api suggested escaping them with \ (: and .) according to: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-select-an-element-by-an-id-that-has-characters-used-in-css-notation/
[04:29:13] <RiFo> but that didn't work
[04:29:47] <RiFo> well i try the hex variant fast in the console
[04:31:12] <doug65536> RiFo: you can wrap $() around the getelementbyid
[04:31:31] <doug65536> RiFo: you can it. $(document.getElementById("text-abc:ab.d/d")).animate ...
[04:31:38] <RiFo> ah thats good =)
[04:32:06] <RiFo> testing quick
[04:32:07] <shoky> RiFo: the slash needs to be escaped too
[04:32:44] <doug65536> $('#text-abc\\:ab\\.d\\/d') works
[04:32:56] <doug65536> but seriously, why?
[04:33:02] <doug65536> use something more reasonable
[04:34:11] <RiFo> its the only unique identifier i have
[04:34:15] <doug65536> RiFo: are you trying to cram information into the id? use data attributes
[04:35:02] <doug65536> RiFo: $('#text-abc\\:ab\\.d\\/d') works
[04:35:46] <dewp> hey guys. i have two problems which i cannot solve due to my inexperience with jquery. i applied the waypoint sticky and a css fade in to my header, but in safari it's not the top layer (the content scrolls abve ist, which works perfectly in FF) - beside that, the content is "jumping" when the sticky gets triggered
[04:36:08] <dewp> maybe it is just a fast thing for you. I am trying to solve it for a few hours now
[04:36:29] <dewp> if anyone could have a look, i would be happy for any help. http://www.jdahl.de/sandbox/update/
[04:38:11] <dewp> oh ... abve ist = above it :-) sometimes i don't see what i'm typing
[04:39:16] <doug65536> dewp: why not just leave height and stuck on those elements?
[04:40:01] <RiFo> i used the wrapping with getdoccumentbyid, worked like a charm =) thanks
[04:41:02] <dewp> doug65536: i don't change the height, do i? it's that what you say what i want.... exactly
[04:41:14] <dewp> the triggered .stuck class is 200px in height
[04:41:43] <doug65536> I can see the attributes changing when I scroll away from the top
[04:41:44] <dewp> i think its perfectly logical why it's jumping but on other pages using this plugin it's not jumping at all
[04:42:06] <doug65536> it jumps hard on chrome
[04:42:15] <dewp> on FF as well
[04:42:33] <dewp> but i have to define the height of the layer to stick
[04:42:46] <doug65536> dewp: are you sure?
[04:42:51] <dewp> no :-)
[04:42:53] <dewp> one second!
[04:44:52] <doug65536> dewp: if you make #menu-wrap { position: absolute; }   it won't affect page flow
[04:46:42] <slax0r> and make it's parent relative, so you may position within that parent
[04:46:45] <doug65536> dewp: my suggestion is to change #menu-wrap.stuck to #menu-wrap.    then separately make class .stuck { position: fixed }
[04:47:03] <doug65536> no dot after #menu-wrap in 1st one
[04:47:38] <dewp> ok, in the first step i tried to remove height/width and made the non-stuck #wrap absolute. no change on my FF
[04:48:03] <doug65536> dewp: ah
[04:48:21] <doug65536> dewp: it's sticky-wrapper that's causing the jump
[04:48:45] <dewp> exactly. but I need it :-)
[04:48:51] <doug65536> dewp: make sticky-wrapper position: absolute
[04:49:07] <dewp> then it's not fixed anymore?
[04:49:27] <doug65536> it will be if you make class .stuck { position: fixed }
[04:49:32] <doug65536> l
[04:49:33] <doug65536> ;
[04:51:09] <doug65536> dewp: here's what I'm saying: right now, sticky-wrapper affects page flow - so if you make it bigger, it pushes everything down. to avoid that, make it position: absolute, so it won't affect page flow. then, separately, have a class .stuck that makes it position: fixed
[04:52:21] <dewp> i cannot change "sticky wrapper" as it is created by the jquery plugin
[04:52:28] <dewp> but! you will laugh
[04:53:33] <dewp> i changed the non-stuck #wrap to relative  and now it seems to be ok. still the safari problem that the header is not on top of everything
[04:54:15] <doug65536> ok, good luck then. you don't appear to be interested in anything I say
[04:54:26] <dewp> sure I am :-)
[04:54:37] <dewp> but it worked the other way
[04:54:55] <dewp> and I cannot change the sticky wrapper because it is dynamically created by the jquery plugin
[04:55:14] <dewp> just the #menu-wrap and #menu
[04:55:23] <dewp> -wrap-bg were created by me
[04:56:40] <doug65536> dewp: what plugin
[04:58:06] <doug65536> dewp: you can use z-index to solve safari issue
[04:58:10] <doug65536> I think
[04:58:11] <dewp> http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/shortcuts/sticky-elements/
[04:58:17] <dewp> I already tried
[04:58:36] <dewp> it seems that safari ignores / is buggy with the background.
[04:58:43] <dewp> of the stuck layer
[04:59:26] <dewp> on my android tablet which uses also chrome the error is not happening.. weird
[04:59:45] <dewp> safari/chrome offer me the same beautiful bug
[05:00:08] <dewp> (yeah it's always good when a newbie calls something which does not work that he created a bug)
[05:07:49] <doug65536> dewp: wouldn't it be a lot simpler to make all that menu stuff be fixed
[05:08:05] <doug65536> dewp: then simply fade in that divider thing when you get a scroll event?
[05:09:24] <dewp> sound's good
[05:09:30] <dewp> -'
[05:10:54] <doug65536> lol that video's pretty neat
[05:10:57] <dewp> i'm thinking. i also want to implement a small button to turn off the sticky header (it's irritating on tablets / smartphones)
[05:11:06] <dewp> is it also possibly with your method?
[05:11:12] <doug65536> yes
[05:11:33] <Emane> Hello
[05:12:21] <Emane> Segaja, you from Estonia?
[05:12:29] <dewp> ok cool. thanks for your input. back in a few minutes :-)
[05:15:26] <Emane> ok
[05:19:07] <doug65536> dewp: I recreated the page in jsfiddle so I can mess around with it http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/EJAkr/
[05:19:25] <doug65536> dewp: the title is the link to real site - I can delete it if you want me to
[05:21:05] <montyjanderson> does anyone here know where i can find the right link for jquery masonry
[05:21:20] <dewp> yeah... the sandbox stuff is not public
[05:21:33] <doug65536> montyjanderson: http://masonry.desandro.com/
[05:22:24] <doug65536> dewp: so delete it then?
[05:22:46] <dewp> if this page is indexed by google: yes please
[05:23:10] <doug65536> done
[05:23:24] <montyjanderson> because there is this link as well http://desandro.github.io/masonry/
[05:23:35] <montyjanderson> and i get confused they are different
[05:23:55] <doug65536> dewp: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/EJAkr/
[05:24:05] <doug65536> dewp: good luck
[05:24:59] <dewp> thanks :-)

[05:27:00] <doug65536> xqo: yes

[05:31:24] <ptlis> Hi, i'm using $.ajax & $.deferred to make API requests that sometimes result in 404, 400 (etc) status codes - these do not necessarily mean there has been a problem, but as far as deferred is concerned they are. Is there any way to change this behaviour? In this api only 5xx status codes are 'true' errors
[05:44:07] <grafi> ptlis that sounds terrible?!
[05:45:26] <ptlis> grafi, not really; a 404 still means that a resource has not been found (so it is a valid http error state) - however in the context of the application that consumes this api this is to be expected
[05:52:09] <grafi> ptlis so you want the "result" to go into your code regardless of the status? maybe .always() is what you are looking for?
[06:04:52] <cam> If I have $('<div></div>', {"class":"foo"}); how do I create that element with something in it? (i.e text)
[06:20:08] <FuryFoo> Please help me refactor this : http://pastebin.com/mpYrWGnH into a for each statement or something better.
[06:20:08] <FuryFoo> I haven't used a for each in some time and I'm a bit rusty.
[06:23:12] <grafi> paste the html for that?
[06:24:55] <FuryFoo> It's just a simple section with several image tags
[06:25:37] <FuryFoo> The section has the .websites class and nothing more
[06:29:24] <FuryFoo> HTML paste

[06:30:21] <sarahm> Hello i'm tryin to create a table dynamically with jquery, first i tried to create just the header , but its not workin somehow, the table isnt displayed on the page but firebug gives no errors
[06:31:37] <nddery> Is it possible to do something these line: "$( '[role = "main"] a[name][!data-ignore]' )" ? Trying to select all anchor with a name attribute but NO data-ignore attribute.
[06:35:53] <cam> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'emtpy'
[06:36:00] <cam> Don't elements all have a .empty method?
[06:36:22] <myosotis> I don't think you can do !data-ignore
[06:36:46] <myosotis> maybe something like .not('[data-ignore]); on your set?
[06:37:18] <cam> I have $(this).parent().children(".class").empty()
[06:37:24] <nddery> Yes, just found that, but doing a[name]:not[data-ignore] throws "cannot call method replace of undefine"
[06:38:36] <myosotis> people are lazy, make a jsfiddle and your chances of success here will rise substantially
[06:38:44] <nddery> Ohh. syntax should be : a[name]:not(a[data-ignore])
[06:39:15] <intellix> people working on mobile…. how do you measure stuff in a PSD?
[06:39:25] <nddery> sorry for being lazy - yes, I'm lazy this morning..
[06:39:34] <intellix> like, I get huge high quality PSDs, but I can't use the same sizes there
[06:39:40] <nddery> Thanks myosotis!
[06:39:45] <intellix> everything is guess work when I'm sizing stuff up
[06:45:29] <dcrouch> I changed urls passwords and such.  http://fpaste.org/37004/83021861/  I have a page called get_time.html, where I return a dictionary from django.  I would like that in jquery, not sure the best route.  I'm getting the following. "TypeError: Object #<i> has no method 'getJSON'
[06:47:17] <dcrouch> changing the this to $, gives TypeError: Cannot call method 'getJSON' of undefined
[06:47:39] <dewp> http://www.jdahl.de/sandbox/update/  - just changed the bg image. but .fadeIn does not work with that... but its ok. the worst thing is that its not working in safari and chrome. maybe there's anyone who knows? :-)
[06:47:59] <dewp> (header not on top in chrome / safari)
[07:01:42] <fl0w> That took me a while to understand. JS can typecast for you, during your if statement.

[07:03:59] <Krauzi> hi guys, can any1 tell me why this code: http://jsfiddle.net/HalembaDesign/a6uzG/2/light/ doesnt work with jquery 1.10 but with 1.5?
[07:04:18] <doug65536> Krauzi: live is gone
[07:04:19] <hazardous> hi, i have var Region = "english";, how can i check on document ready to find any <select class="lang"> and automatically pre-select the option with the <option value="english">?
[07:04:26] <hazardous> cant figure out if i should be using .each or something
[07:04:44] <doug65536> Krauzi: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/a6uzG/30/
[07:05:21] <Krauzi> doug65536: danke, gracias, thanks
[07:07:41] <mls_> hi
[07:09:36] <Krauzi> another question: is there maybe a better way to do such a popup thing? i need to build a little configuration menu for my website
[07:09:54] <doug65536> Krauzi: what you're doing looks fine to me
[07:12:50] <doug65536> Krauzi: you may not want position: fixed in the popup. on mobile the popup might not fit
[07:13:14] <doug65536> Krauzi: if you are sure that the content will be small, it is fine as is
[07:16:52] <Cpudan80> Hey
[07:17:01] <Cpudan80> Hope this is the right place for jqueryui too -- so here goes
[07:17:20] <Psycho_pr> hi jQuery UI, how do I make the accordion all closed initially?
[07:17:24] <Cpudan80> I have a datepicker control that is inside an iframe that I've opened with a simplemodal popup
[07:17:43] <Cpudan80> All that works fine, except the z order on the datepicker is real low and you can't see it (well, you can only see a part of it)
[07:18:10] <Cpudan80> I've added z-index: 5000 !important to #datepicker-ui-div in my css, but no luck
[07:26:18] <denysonique> Why live() has been removed?
[07:26:46] <denysonique> Before I could just $('selector').live('click', callback)
[07:27:08] <scott_gonzalez> Just use .delegate() on the document.
[07:27:14] <denysonique> now I need to $(document).on('selector', 'click', callback)
[07:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> Which now is just .on().
[07:27:23] <denysonique> which makes the code less readable
[07:27:38] <Cork> denysonique: cause it is a broken interface and there are better options to do the exact same thing
[07:27:46] <NoiseEee> denysonique: would you rather have code that wasn't reliable, or change a touch of code. what about that line isn't readable?
[07:28:06] <denysonique> What was unreliable about live()?
[07:28:15] <NoiseEee> read the docs?
[07:28:21] <Cork> it isn't about reliability
[07:28:25] <Cork> it is about performance
[07:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> That's not true.
[07:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's a broken API.
[07:28:37] <Cork> yes
[07:28:38] <scott_gonzalez> It's not about performance.
[07:28:39] <denysonique> if it was b0rken
[07:28:49] <denysonique> then it could have been aliased to: $(document).on('selector', 'click', callback)
[07:28:52] <denysonique> .live()
[07:28:52] <scott_gonzalez> If it was about performance, changing to $( docuement ).on() wouldn't help.
[07:29:01] <Cork> the broken part; and performance related part, is that it searches through the dom and then doesn't use the result
[07:29:02] <scott_gonzalez> .live() doesn't work in the middle of a chain.
[07:29:07] <scott_gonzalez> Because it has no idea what selector to use.
[07:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, *that* performance.
[07:29:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, there's an up-front cost, but it's negligible.
[07:29:36] <Cork> and is fundamentally just a bad api
[07:29:59] <denysonique> aliasing .live() to $(document).on would be fine
[07:30:07] <denysonique> The new .live()
[07:30:23] <Cork> denysonique: you can't do that cause live works backwards
[07:30:25] <scott_gonzalez> Except it'd still be broken in exactly the same way.
[07:30:38] <scott_gonzalez> $( "#foo" ).next().on( ... ) vs $( "#foo ).next().live( ... )
[07:30:55] <Bish> what happens if i apply .click to an object twice?
[07:31:01] <Bish> will both be triggered, or will the old one be replaced
[07:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> You get 2 click handlers.
[07:31:05] <denysonique> Cork: backwards?
[07:31:09] <Bish> if 1. how do i remove the first one
[07:31:11] <denysonique> Bish: both
[07:31:18] <denysonique> Bish: .off()
[07:31:31] <denysonique> .off('click').on('click'...
[07:31:39] <Bish> thank you
[07:31:39] <Cork> denysonique: what live does is $() searchs the dom for matching elements, .live ignore this result list and uses .selector instead
[07:32:00] <scott_gonzalez> .off( "click" ) is terrible. Track your handlers.
[07:32:01] <Cork> denysonique: then it uses $(document).on(event, this.selector, callback)
[07:32:15] <Cork> denysonique: so the fundamental structure of live is the problem
[07:32:27] <Cork> denysonique: and that is why it was depricated, and later removed
[07:32:32] <scott_gonzalez> .off( "click" ) is going to unbind every click handler. Not just the one you think you want ot remove.
[07:32:33] <uwjesq> Hello. If I use a canvas in a prettyphoto, the canvas stays blank. Anyone ever encountered this or a similar problem? Help appreciated.
[07:33:19] <denysonique> Cork: yes but live can be aliased in a new, to simply $(document).on
[07:33:24] <denysonique> there must be a way
[07:33:40] <Cork> denysonique: no, cause the problem with live is how you call it
[07:33:52] <Cork> $.live could be used
[07:34:00] <Cork> if you prefered that
[07:34:10] <NoiseEee> denysonique: embrace change and fixes?
[07:34:45] <Cork> $.live = function(event, selector, callback) { $(document).on(event, selector, callback); }; $.live('click', 'target', function() {});
[07:34:53] <Cork> denysonique: though i don't see much point in it
[07:35:21] <denysonique> I didn't get the part what would be wrong with $('selector').live
[07:35:37] <denysonique> as $('selector') could simply be passed to $(document).on
[07:35:38] <Cork> denysonique: cause $() is one function call and .live is a second
[07:35:56] <Cork> and the problem with live is exactly that is uses $()
[07:36:31] <denysonique> Cork: but you can make $() to tell what was supplied in $() to live
[07:36:35] <Joel> I have some inputs that enabled on ready based on a select box. I need to add validators once these inputs are enabled. What's the best way to be certain the validation js is called after the inputs are enabled
[07:36:38] <denysonique> before processing it
[07:36:45] <denysonique> before it was 'processed'
[07:36:54] <Cork> denysonique: yes, but we have already told you the two problems with doing that
[07:37:27] <Cork> denysonique: 1. is makes a search through the dom, and depending on the page and selector, it can actually be significant
[07:37:39] <Cork> denysonique: secondly you can't use it with other jquery functions
[07:38:02] <Cork> Cpudan80: http://jsfiddle.net/VJNAD/
[07:38:03] <Cork> fwm
[07:38:11] <denysonique> Cork: right
[07:38:53] <Cork> denysonique: there is jquery-migration
[07:39:01] <Cpudan80> Cork: Yes, but in my case it is inside an iframe inside a simplemodal popup
[07:39:05] <Cpudan80> So, not simple
[07:39:06] <Cork> you can load that lib and it will add a wrapper to restore support for live
[07:39:20] <Cork> denysonique: through that doesn't mean the function is fixed there
[07:39:40] <Cork> Cpudan80: it can't never get outside the iframe
[07:39:52] <Cork> Cpudan80: but if you set the rule in the iframe it should work just fine
[07:39:52] <Cpudan80> right - that's what I figured
[07:40:02] <Cpudan80> well, that wont work
[07:40:15] <Cork> s/never/ever/
[07:40:37] <denysonique> Cpudan80: for webkit you can use the native datepicker: http://jsfiddle.net/VJNAD/4/
[07:41:03] <Cpudan80> not helpful
[07:41:05] <Cpudan80> but ok
[07:41:50] <dewp> doug65536: http://www.jdahl.de/sandbox/update/ - not jumping anymore but still the chrome / safari issue :-/
[07:43:02] <doug65536> dewp: what's wrong?
[07:43:30] <dewp> when I open this in safari or chrome the content scrolls above the fixed header
[07:43:38] <doug65536> dewp: not my chrome
[07:43:56] <doug65536> dewp: hold shift and press reload button
[07:44:05] <doug65536> dewp: it forces it to download everything
[07:44:14] <dewp> sure ... still the same
[07:44:18] <dewp> strange
[07:45:05] <doug65536> dewp: right click the reload button and pick hard reload
[07:45:28] <dewp> maybe it is an osx issue?
[07:45:45] <doug65536> dewp: doubt it. I'm in linux
[07:45:47] <dewp> because safari has exactly the same issue (and i disabled cache on both browsers)
[07:46:00] <dewp> but my chrome on android works also fine
[07:46:34] <doug65536> dewp: did you try another machine?
[07:47:28] <doug65536> dewp: or, go into chrome settings, advanced, go to bottom. is hardware acceleration checked?
[07:48:37] <dewp> funny, without hardware accelleration it's fine
[07:48:48] <dewp> maybe my open gl driver should be re-installed
[07:48:48] <doug65536> dewp: display driver bug most likely
[07:49:40] <dewp> cool that you could point me that fast to this... would have debugged for hours until i would have let it check on another mac
[07:50:51] <doug65536> dewp: first I checked the styles. they were right, so I knew it wasn't the page. and it worked for me
[07:52:16] <doug65536> dewp: and I know what a disaster of complexity it is to render web pages :) and I've seen display driver bugs in browsers before
[07:53:25] <dewp> yeah... I am not experienced with coding but I always like to try new stuff
[07:54:05] <dewp> and what I do is more copy / paste / customize than coding ;----)
[07:54:35] <doug65536> hey...
[07:55:49] <doug65536> dewp: can you test my 3d css animation code on osx for me? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/aTsyS/234/
[07:56:41] <tapmodo> seems to work ok for me in chrome...
[07:57:04] <doug65536> tapmodo: which OS?
[07:57:23] <{{Guy}}> DOS 5.0?
[07:57:35] <Joel> doug65536: win 7/chrome, a bit weird that the right side appears before rotation
[07:57:38] <dewp> its not true 3d right? the planes have very small gaps
[07:57:45] <doug65536> it is true 3d
[07:57:57] <doug65536> chrome doesn't do the backface removal correctly
[07:58:10] <tapmodo> doug65536: OS X
[07:58:26] <doug65536> tapmodo: thanks
[07:58:44] <doug65536> true 3d http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/aTsyS/235/
[07:58:50] <tapmodo> i do see this backface removal thing you mention though
[07:59:01] <dewp> yey :)
[07:59:24] <dewp> but its just planes that explains the gap between 3 and 4
[07:59:32] <dewp> 2.5d
[07:59:38] <doug65536> no, it is 3d
[07:59:44] <dewp> didnt know its possible, funny
[07:59:46] <doug65536> I could make the camera fly around
[07:59:53] <Bloomberg> Hi guys!!
[07:59:59] <doug65536> it computes transformation matrices like a game engine would
[08:00:02] <dewp> cool
[08:00:43] <doug65536> thanks for checking on OS X. this pushes browsers pretty hard - firefox has weird issue only on linux. etc
[08:01:21] <dewp> i let my page check on a macbook pro - same issue!!! heumpf :-(
[08:01:26] <doug65536> dewp: it is true 3d, but not a triangle mesh. but it does transform divs
[08:01:44] <doug65536> dewp: that's what webgl is for
[08:01:48] <dewp> i c
[08:01:50] <Bloomberg> guys!!
[08:02:01] <Bloomberg> I have a problem with the title date of fullcalendar
[08:02:28] <Bloomberg> In the start all is ok, but when I click an event the header date mose and change of color
[08:02:42] <doug65536> I was thinking of making a css wolfenstein for a laugh with it, with better camera
[08:02:45] <dewp> can i tell safari not to use hardware accelleration?
[08:03:20] <dewp> doug65536 just had the same thought, i would try it =)
[08:04:42] <doug65536> dewp: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3373896?start=0&tstart=0
[08:06:49] <dewp> yeah, but I meant as a command for the users browser ... its bad that it has these ogl issues on osx with enabled accelleration. I just would like to disable it for my page
[08:11:24] <mls_> anyone using jquery validate would know why some of my fields errors are hidden when submitting my form ? (error fields do appear when I focus out the field, but not on submit)
[08:11:43] <tiky> is there a standard way to mix two arrays a and b, so that i get a1,b1,a2,b2,a3,b3...
[08:11:51] <tiky> all elements "b" are the same thing
[08:12:43] <WrinkledCheese> I have an interesting problem.  $(path).on('mouseup', function(event){console.log(event)}); has mixed results in various browsers.
[08:12:51] <WrinkledCheese> path being an SVGPath object
[08:13:07] <WrinkledCheese> Firefox and Chrome work fine but Internet explorer fails to fire an event.
[08:13:16] <tiky> unsuprising WrinkledCheese
[08:13:18] <WrinkledCheese> IE 10 on Windows 8.  Any ideas why
[08:13:32] <WrinkledCheese> ?because it's Microsoft or because it's a known issue.
[08:13:37] <WrinkledCheese> ?or both
[08:13:49] <tiky> in all likelihood they didn't implement SVG pixel-by-pixel in the dom
[08:14:22] <shoky> WrinkledCheese: jquery doesn't support SVG really. for best results use some plugin/library e.g. raphael
[08:14:42] <WrinkledCheese> It works for Firefox and IE 8 no problem.
[08:14:49] <WrinkledCheese> ?..let me think about what I'm typing
[08:14:51] <doug65536> dewp: not likely
[08:14:58] <WrinkledCheese> It works for Firefox and Chrome no problem
[08:15:09] <dewp> then I have to find a completely different method :-/
[08:15:20] <donmartini> Hey I am looking for a menu that is vertical and the text is sideways
[08:15:22] <WrinkledCheese> I juse d3 to generate the SVG, jQuery just assigns events.
[08:15:41] <WrinkledCheese> It's an overlay for a map.
[08:15:41] <WrinkledCheese> s/juse/use/
[08:15:56] <doug65536> donmartini: transform: rotateZ(90deg)
[08:16:09] <mls_> WrinkledCheese: maybe related to bubbling ? don't know...
[08:17:02] <WrinkledCheese> $(path).on('click', function(event){console.log(event);}); works "fine" In IE 10?it fires 2 click events.
[08:17:30] <WrinkledCheese> mouseup does not fire any events
[08:18:26] <Bloomberg> Someone know how can I add a limit of events for day in fullcalendar?
[08:18:45] <dewp> chrome on win8 also hardware acceleration "bug" :-(
[08:18:54] <dewp> only FF works
[08:19:00] <dewp> cross platform
[08:21:39] <donmartini> It wont let me use that on the navbar
[08:23:43] <donmartini> ok it let me rotate it but is hidden behind the rest of the application
[08:25:18] <doug65536> donmartini: transform-origin
[08:25:43] <DarsVaeda> can anyone recommend a script that will help styling selectboxes and have them responsive?
[08:31:37] <dewp> doug65536, it seems to have something to do with the backface visibility... i set it to hidden and the bug changed, its now without flickering but the image got translated 800px or so to the right

[08:59:53] <dieguezz> [doug65536] i was already working.. ty so much.. Ill do it with the cleaner version you made :). Another question... if i want to make a conditional like.. if someone chooses an option from dropdown, then , depending on the option selected, multiply one of the checkbox values by, 1, 2.. 9. This is because in the earlier dropdown they choose how many people is applying, and the checkbox is a discount for each. So if they chose 2 persons, t
[09:00:57] <doug65536> dieguezz: call .val() on the dropdown to get the value of the selected option
[09:01:25] <dieguezz> [doug65536] the thing is that the valie of selected dropdown is not 1, 2, 3.. its a price
[09:01:50] <doug65536> dieguezz: the <option> tags have a value= attribute?
[09:02:13] <dieguezz> [doug65536] yeah
[09:02:56] <dieguezz> [doug65536] as its made for wordpress, the value will be the price the end user will place in a shortcode. So this is the value.. <?php $posi=1; echo get_post_meta($post->ID, 'alojamientoyff', true)*$posi; ?>"

[09:17:04] <Maximilian> hey, how can i select all input elements without a value?? input[value=""] doesnt select input elements with no value specified
[09:17:08] <doug65536> first of all, ajax is asynchronous
[09:17:21] <doug65536> xnotte: second, you can't access functions in another scope like that
[09:17:36] <doug65536> xnotte: where does idprof get its array elements assigned?
[09:18:00] <xnotte> doug65536:  idprof = data.id;
[09:18:19] <doug65536> xnotte: id is an array?
[09:18:39] <xnotte> i receive data from ajax, and atrib to idprof
[09:18:47] <xnotte> id its an atribute
[09:19:37] <xnotte> it comes in json like {{id,name},{id,name}...}
[09:20:03] <Maximilian> input:not([value]) does select all inputs even those with a value

[09:24:36] <xnotte> doug65536: whats the problem ?
[09:25:00] <doug65536> xnotte: oh I missed your reply.. 1 sec
[09:26:14] <doug65536> xnotte: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8uV7G/1/
[09:27:20] <doug65536> xnotte: getProfessional returns long before that success function gets called
[09:27:53] <doug65536> xnotte: you have to process the data in the success callback
[09:28:27] <Bloomberg> doug65536: man you could help me with a problem?
[09:28:35] <doug65536> Bloomberg: yes

[09:36:54] <Xal_> What is a good solution for pulling json strings through ajax that are too big?
[09:37:27] <Xal_> It breaks when it tries to parse them.
[09:41:12] <mobasher> hi i want to alert the error message of all ajax calls in the page but i don't know how to alert the message that shows the exact problem so taht i can fix it. i used "ajaxError" event but i dont know how to print the error message
[09:42:50] <Quest> can any one help me out with this. why this http://jsfiddle.net/n8MvQ/2/       is not show 5 second css3 transition time ?
[09:44:04] <Joel> Quest: isn't animation best handled by jquery-ui?
[09:44:04] <WrinkledCheese> Does anyone have any ideas how I can debug IE not firing mouseup events?
[09:44:21] <Quest> Joel,  it is but css is native
[09:45:06] <WrinkledCheese> I haven't used Microsoft products for over 5 years, so I'm a bit rusty.
[09:45:32] <WrinkledCheese> The built in debugger isn't very good, you can't drill down into the console.log objects.
[09:45:39] <Quest>  Transitions don't work on display.. but i need a way around
[09:46:51] <per2> random question, anyone know why this wouldn't work? ALTER TABLE vault ALTER COLUMN title VARCHAR(250) NULL
[09:47:00] <RabSimpson> hi folks. i'm trying to change the background colour of a specific element in an infinite loop (changing between 2 colours). the colour change bit i can do, but i can't work out how to loop it. any ideas?
[09:47:12] <RabSimpson> per2: is that an SQL question?
[09:47:22] <per2> yeah, sorry if this is unrelated to this forumnm
[09:47:26] <per2> channel
[09:47:30] <Joel> per2: #sql
[09:47:43] <RabSimpson> yeah, or #mysql
[09:47:43] <per2> thanks
[09:50:51] <Quest>  opacity stil not workin http://jsfiddle.net/n8MvQ/10/
[09:52:11] <Joel> Quest: you're telling it to not display, there's no time to transition
[09:54:20] <Quest> Joel,  hm
[09:54:46] <Joel> Quest: you specify a time to do the transition over, but you've already set display to none
[09:55:02] <Joel> Quest: you also don't seem to specify a size to transition to

[09:58:52] <WrinkledCheese> console.log(path) reveals: [object SVGPathElement] path.addEventListener('mouseup', function(event){console.log('mouse up!');}); never fires.  Now it's not even a jQuery issue.
[09:58:58] <WrinkledCheese> Works fine in Firefox
[09:59:38] <NoiseEee> WrinkledCheese: perhaps the issue is actually SVG?  haven't really heard of anyone sane relying on MS to provide decent SVG support recently
[10:00:43] <NoiseEee> WrinkledCheese: what version of IE?
[10:01:10] <snover> NoiseEee: their svg support is just fine.
[10:01:14] <NoiseEee> WrinkledCheese: also, there is no addEventListener in IE?
[10:01:50] <WrinkledCheese> That may be an issue
[10:01:54] <WrinkledCheese> I've tried 10 and 9
[10:02:15] <NoiseEee> attachEvent for IE, but if you're in jquery, why not 'on()' ?
[10:02:54] <WrinkledCheese> Originally it was $(path).on('mouseup', function(event){console.log('mouse up!');}); but that doesn't work either
[10:03:05] <WrinkledCheese> replace mouseup with click and it fires 2 click events
[10:03:19] <WrinkledCheese> jQuery 1.8.2?may be the issue.
[10:03:24] <WrinkledCheese> I will try upgrading
[10:03:40] <WrinkledCheese> I though taddEventListener was standard, should have known better.
[10:04:29] <NoiseEee> nah, 1.8.2 has on()
[10:04:50] <WrinkledCheese> ?but does it have IE 10 support
[10:04:58] <WrinkledCheese> I know it has on, it works in Firefox and Chrome.
[10:05:06] <NoiseEee> sure
[10:05:22] <WrinkledCheese> :/
[10:05:43] <WrinkledCheese> I can't figure out how to debug this lack of event firing.  I'm used to Firefox debugging support and pretty much 99.999999% of everything that works in Firefox works in Chrome.
[10:06:41] <NoiseEee> wish i had IE to help you, but maybe try creating a fiddle and someone cal chime in
[10:07:15] <WrinkledCheese> If I do the code as a masic page with jsut a svg element, events work.
[10:07:48] <NoiseEee> is there anything overtop the SVG?  any other libraries involved? find out what's different between 'basic page' and your page
[10:07:59] <WrinkledCheese> Tonns of libraries
[10:08:18] <NoiseEee> so maybe add one at a time until it stops working and start there?
[10:08:28] <WrinkledCheese> I use D3 for data, jQuery for basic DOM manipulation, leaflet for mapping.
[10:08:36] <NoiseEee> mmmmm leaflet
[10:09:03] <WrinkledCheese> It's just an SVG overlay on top of the leaflet tiles
[10:09:16] <WrinkledCheese> ?it's a leaflet overlay layer, those are the only two layers
[10:09:56] <javalover> ok so i've had a scroll issue all week that I just solved
[10:10:15] <javalover> but now I have a slight bug this is my sroll issue any help would be great
[10:10:26] <WrinkledCheese> Why would on('click'?.) works and on('mouseup'?) not?
[10:10:26] <WrinkledCheese> It makes no sense.
[10:10:43] <javalover> first of all wrinkledcheese, those 2 methods are very different
[10:10:58] <javalover> on click is the act of going down & then up
[10:11:07] <WrinkledCheese> Right
[10:11:07] <javalover> where as mouseup is the act of just up
[10:11:22] <WrinkledCheese> so click is the act of up and down on the same element and up is just up
[10:11:33] <javalover> no, click is the act of DOWN & then UP!
[10:11:45] <WrinkledCheese> ...yup
[10:11:53] <javalover> you have to understand it's an order of things
[10:11:57] <WrinkledCheese> I put them back asswards
[10:12:01] <NoiseEee> perhaps a library is overwriting/canceling the event?
[10:12:04] <javalover> yeah don't do that when isolating an issue
[10:12:16] <javalover> NoiseE: i think you're on the right track
[10:12:32] <WrinkledCheese> So standards order is:  Down, Up, Click, Down, Up, Click, DblClick.  IE is Down, Up, Click, Up, DblClick.
[10:13:02] <javalover> k
[10:13:37] <WrinkledCheese> Why would the event fire in Firefox or Chrome if the event is cancelled by another library?  I will look into it but I believe the default is to execute default events and I don't believe I'm overriding that functionality.
[10:13:40] <javalover> anyways my issue was this, I was appending a new element without changing the height of the element I was appending to, causing the page to jump
[10:14:05] <javalover> now I change the height to be even 200 pixels more than the new content & i fixed my bug however....
[10:14:27] <javalover> now the page jumps just for the part where I change the height....
[10:15:03] <javalover> so it jumps a tiny bit instead of the entire length of the new content, which is how high it was jumping before
[10:15:45] <javalover> which honestly I can live with, but if it is fixable i'd love to fix it
[10:16:00] <javalover> anyways onto helping wrinkled cheese I guess
[10:16:25] <javalover> Cheese, I know for a fact firefox/chrome perform wayy better than I.E.
[10:16:36] <javalover> and if your issue is based on browsers, then look into the browser itself
[10:17:31] <WrinkledCheese> I'm looking into how jquery.on cancells events then I'm searching my code for that.
[10:17:56] <javalover> my motto, if it works in firefox, it works. And I.E. is just too stupid to comprehend it, so the only question is do you want to fix for I.E. or simply type at top "heres a link to firefox, as your browser is out of date, the internet has been upgraded, don't be that person who still uses beta max tapes when we're all on Blue Ray (the new kind of DVD, case you didn't know which you probably don't cuz you're on Internet Explorer)
[10:17:59] <WrinkledCheese> I've found 6 on mouseup events defined, none fire in IE, all fire in FIrefox and Chrome so...
[10:18:13] <WrinkledCheese> I must support IE
[10:18:27] <WrinkledCheese> some of our clients mandate that IE is the ONLY browser allowed on company computers.
[10:18:32] <WrinkledCheese> IE ISPs.
[10:18:45] <javalover> k well than just know this
[10:18:47] <javalover> if it works on firefox
[10:18:54] <javalover> it's not a jquery issue, it's a browser specific issue
[10:19:09] <javalover> and for that, you have to check to see which browser the client has & then run different code
[10:19:12] <javalover> I.E. BULLLSHIT!
[10:19:18] <WrinkledCheese> Yeah, I know
[10:19:34] <WrinkledCheese> I've used conditional comments to circumvent IE bullshit in the past
[10:19:44] <javalover> I would even go as far to have 2 different jquerys
[10:19:49] <javalover> 1 for firefox & 1 for i.e.
[10:19:52] <WrinkledCheese> But my motto is:  Code for Firefox, check against Chrom.  ?hack in IE where possible.
[10:19:53] <javalover> and just change how it works lol
[10:20:00] <javalover> yeah
[10:20:07] <NoiseEee> javalover: that makes no sense.
[10:20:19] <javalover> what clearly jquery isn't working for him in I.E.
[10:20:37] <NoiseEee> no, as he stated, in a simple case, it works fine in IE (correct?)
[10:20:38] <javalover> a new version where onclick actually means on i.e. click could benefit
[10:20:39] <WrinkledCheese> I don't think it's jQuery at all.
[10:20:44] <javalover> oh
[10:20:48] <NoiseEee> besides the fact that jquery works just fine and dandy with IE
[10:20:50] <javalover> well then i'm out of the loop
[10:21:18] <javalover> i don't even test for I.E.
[10:21:23] <WrinkledCheese> Right and the click event works, replace the text click with mouseup and it stops working.  I'm looking into cancelled event defaults to see if that is indeed the issue.
[10:21:32] <WrinkledCheese> I wouldn't either, but I must.
[10:21:37] <javalover> i just tell user "GET FIREFOX DEAL WITH IT, ur at work who cares tell ur boss to get I.E. not an excuse to claim ur at work"
[10:21:56] <WrinkledCheese> That will send them to a competitor.
[10:22:05] <javalover> no
[10:22:06] <javalover> honestly
[10:22:14] <NoiseEee> javalover: please, people have real life requirements.
[10:22:16] <javalover> it's bull to say they're at work so they have to use i.e.
[10:22:27] <WrinkledCheese> No it's not.
[10:22:30] <javalover> yes it is
[10:22:34] <WrinkledCheese> They're on work computres they have no control over.
[10:22:42] <javalover> that's like me saying, i'm at work, I have to use an apple
[10:22:54] <WrinkledCheese> The bigwigs at the top say let's stop messing with these different browser issues and PICK ONE
[10:23:01] <javalover> YEAH
[10:23:05] <javalover> TELL BIG WIGS TO PICK FIREFOX
[10:23:11] <javalover> IF WE AS THE CODERS ALL USE IT WHY NOT THEM!?
[10:23:14] <WrinkledCheese> ?and they go with what they use at home and not being technical people themselves they jsut go with what came in the box?.
[10:23:22] <Cpudan80> Ok so - question about the datepicker control
[10:23:35] <WrinkledCheese> ?I'm at work I have to use an apple.
[10:23:51] <Cpudan80> Im seeing certain times where the control, which is inside a simplemodal popup, has multiple activation buttons next to the text field...
[10:23:58] <Cpudan80> any idea why that might happen?
[10:24:19] <WrinkledCheese> ?we have 12 apple machiens and 1 Windows machine.  Servers all run Free/Net BSD
[10:24:19] <WrinkledCheese> ?maybe a Linux box or two in the mix?not sure these days.
[10:30:07] <Quest> I dont want to specifiy a height for http://jsfiddle.net/n8MvQ/17/    #user-options.user-options-show      but height:auto ; doesnt animates the height  (giving fixed height in px does fine). any work arounds?
[10:34:08] <WrinkledCheese> path.on('mouseup', function(event){?}); path.fireEvent('onmouseup'); Fires the event that does not work with a mouse up action........
[10:34:21] <WrinkledCheese> I think it might have something to do with the stupid "POINTER" api
[10:35:34] <Xal_> Is there any way to have an ajax function process any kind of 'percentage complete" value while downloading?
[10:36:11] <WrinkledCheese> Are you downloading the file via JavaScript?
[10:36:21] <WrinkledCheese> Or is it a native browser download?
[10:36:42] <Xal_> through the jquery ajax function
[10:37:00] <bradfordli123> is jqfundamentals.com a good resource for learning/practice?
[10:37:02] <WrinkledCheese> I'm not sure if you have access to the headers.
[10:37:28] <WrinkledCheese> It should be doable though.
[10:37:33] <NoiseEee> bradfordli123: yes
[10:37:33] <WrinkledCheese> I've seen it around.
[10:37:44] <bradfordli123> thank you
[10:38:05] <WrinkledCheese> NoiseEee, did you see my post about manually firing the onmouseup event?
[10:38:14] <bradfordli123> is there anything else you guys would recommend?
[10:38:21] <NoiseEee> WrinkledCheese: yeah. interesting... maybe google about it
[10:38:37] <WrinkledCheese> I think it might be related to IEs mouse + pen+touch = pointer.
[10:38:58] <WrinkledCheese> I'm leaning in that direction.
[10:40:07] <WrinkledCheese> NoiseEee, do you know of a way to intercept all events so I can log them to console to find out what exactly the browser is detecting while I let the mouse button up?
[10:40:59] <NoiseEee> not offhand, but will a breakpoint help so you can step through?
[10:41:33] <WrinkledCheese> Yeah, it's hard to read e=f+g?..
[10:41:51] <WrinkledCheese> I suppose I could throw unminimized jQuery in there
[10:43:23] <wrp6> Test
[10:43:47] <NoiseEee> WrinkledCheese: yes! literally no point in minifying anything but final production code.
[10:43:58] <wrp6> Is it possible for a function added to a Callbacks instance to remove itself?
[10:44:05] <wrp6> I'd like to trigger an event once
[10:44:37] <doug65536> it's not even really necessary to minimize production code for that matter. it will be cached anyway
[10:44:44] <doug65536> minify*
[10:45:33] <NoiseEee> meh, on that i'd disagree but shrug
[10:48:54] <dieguezz> hi, i am trying to get the value of a checkbox and change it by another. The problem is i got more than one checkbox and this is only working for 1st one.This is what i got: http://jsfiddle.net/GHpcN/
[10:53:45] <WrinkledCheese> Well, I found a hackaround.
[10:54:36] <WrinkledCheese> $(path).on('click', function(event){console.log('Internet EXPLOSIVE DIARHEA Detected');path.fireEvent('onmouseup');});
[10:54:43] <WrinkledCheese> ....
[10:54:51] <WrinkledCheese> there is a if(document.all) in there.
[10:55:34] <blez> http://jsfiddle.net/AHMDy/3/ how can I trigger .expand?
[10:55:41] <blez> like the event on hover
[10:56:17] <dewp> Could someone help me with an OSX & Webkit specific thing? when you scroll down so that the content is obscured by the header -  and hover the menu in Chrome or Safari it gets a hole: http://www.jdahl.de/sandbox/update/index.php?i=3d
[10:56:43] <doug65536> blez: trigger expand?
[10:57:02] <blez> from the example
[10:57:14] <blez> I want to execute the transform css animation
[10:58:41] <thesisb> Creating a jquery plugin extends the jquery prototype object, correct?
[10:58:56] <thesisb> Does this cause significant slowdown if you have 500 micro plugins?
[10:59:04] <thesisb> How much is too much?
[10:59:13] <doug65536> thesisb: it adds a property to $.fn
[10:59:39] <doug65536> thesisb: no amount is too much, it uses a hash table, which is practically instant in all cases
[11:00:31] <thesisb> doug65536: so creating 500 unique objects is equally as fast (or almost) as adding 500 plugins if they are the same?
[11:01:01] <doug65536> thesisb: anything that happens once is irrelevant to performance
[11:01:10] <blez> somebody?
[11:01:39] <doug65536> thesisb: 500 plugins?
[11:01:45] <thesisb> doug65536: unless that once, after 300 previous adds, takes 3seconds haha
[11:02:00] <doug65536> thesisb: 500 properties is *nothing* for js
[11:02:21] <thesisb> so what number starts getting heavy for JS (worst case ie8)
[11:02:26] <thesisb> ie 8
[11:02:57] <doug65536> thesisb: http://jsperf.com
[11:03:11] <thesisb> I'm not sure how to test it
[11:06:35] <doug65536> thesisb: can make 140,000 objects with 500 properties per second
[11:06:51] <thesisb> in chrome?
[11:06:55] <doug65536> yes
[11:07:03] <thesisb> link, ill test ie
[11:07:11] <doug65536> http://jsperf.com/add-500-properties
[11:07:29] <doug65536> oops, hold on
[11:07:30] <doug65536> bug
[11:08:47] <doug65536> thesisb: ok, huge bug fixed. 4330 500-property objects per second with function literal
[11:08:54] <doug65536> thesisb: http://jsperf.com/add-500-properties
[11:08:59] <doug65536> refresh
[11:09:44] <doug65536> thesisb: trust me, the speed of objects will not be the problem. the first time, downloading 500 plugins will be the problem. from then on, even 500 plugins will be nothing
[11:10:21] <doug65536> thesisb: and that's assuming a silly number like 500
[11:10:22] <thesisb> yea so these 500 plugins get uglified + gziped into a 400kb asset and then cached
[11:10:33] <thesisb> But I wanted to make sure page loads didnt slow things down more than they should
[11:10:50] <doug65536> 400kb?
[11:11:00] <NoiseEee> just surprised there's a use-case for 500 plugins
[11:11:10] <doug65536> I don't think there are 400kb of gzipped minified plugins on earth
[11:11:17] <thesisb> haha
[11:11:31] <thesisb> It's the way I've structured my code, every section has its own plugin
[11:11:35] <thesisb> and there are many sections
[11:11:40] <thesisb> not much overlap
[11:11:44] <justgage> This is the place I can ask questions right?
[11:11:51] <doug65536> justgage: yes
[11:12:02] <NoiseEee> justgage: yes, but you just asked your allotted question :(
[11:12:39] <MrPunkin> Okay question, so say jQuery sets a namespaced submit function on a form. Is there a way to see that function outside of jQuery?
[11:14:45] <thesisb> 900 ops per second for an empty literal
[11:14:47] <thesisb> on ie8
[11:19:48] <doug65536> thesisb: yes, where an "op" is building an object with 500 functions
[11:20:21] <doug65536> thesisb: so it's just over 1/1000th of a second to make an object with 500 properties
[11:20:25] * blez somebody?
[11:20:29] <javalover> it's incredible, this thing is working now
[11:20:41] <javalover> and now only 1 last glitch
[11:20:56] <thesisb> doug65536: yes but each page load creates all those objects
[11:20:57] <javalover> somehow for whatever reason when i've loaded like 500 posts, they start to glitch on next load
[11:21:03] <thesisb> so thats like 100~200ms
[11:21:14] <thesisb> even though only 5 are used
[11:21:20] <javalover> so theres  probably a fix for this to prevent the glitch, but it looks like a repaint issue....
[11:21:24] <doug65536> thesisb: how do you figure 100 or 200
[11:21:26] <Bloomberg> doug65536: man are you there?
[11:21:33] <Bloomberg> I come back
[11:21:37] <thesisb> from my development builds
[11:21:40] <javalover> I am using .show() in case anyone knows of repaint bugs  using .show that would be of help
[11:21:48] <thesisb> network tab
[11:21:58] <javalover> anyways imma take a break, so happy this is finally working
[11:21:58] <thesisb> its about 120ms now
[11:22:09] <doug65536> thesisb: yeah so what? you think you'll avoid that? it's I/O
[11:22:29] <thesisb> I'm just trying to see how I can cut that down
[11:22:47] <doug65536> thesisb: make an empty page with "hello" in it
[11:22:53] <doug65536> thesisb: see how many ms that is
[11:23:01] <thesisb> Not for the entire page load
[11:23:09] <thesisb> for just that compressed gzipd js file
[11:23:16] <thesisb> to execute the final init
[11:23:25] <doug65536> thesisb: no no. make a page with JUST the letter A. a 1 byte page. see the ms for that
[11:23:34] <thesisb> k
[11:24:03] <thesisb> 2ms locally
[11:24:27] <justgage> for some reason this loop only creates one row in this table http://jsfiddle.net/zVw8Z/
[11:24:27] <thesisb> 1ms without some clutter
[11:24:32] <doug65536> and your other measurement is locally?
[11:24:37] <thesisb> yes
[11:24:40] <justgage> Anyone help me with that
[11:25:26] <doug65536> thesisb: measure on a real website
[11:25:36] <thesisb> k
[11:25:45] <doug65536> thesisb: local measurements are irrelevant
[11:26:12] <thesisb> 194ms in a server far far away no cache
[11:26:50] <thesisb> but im talking about processing time not latency :/
[11:26:55] <doug65536> thesisb: are you doing real perf measurements or trying to convince yourself that there is a performance problem? I think you're already convinced
[11:27:38] <MrPunkin> is there a reason trigger('submit.placeholder') works but triggerHandler('submit.placeholder') fails?
[11:28:06] <doug65536> thesisb: processing time. ok, I've had enough. good luck
[11:28:33] <thesisb> doug65536: I don't understand why you're taking this so personally, but thanks for you help so far.  I'll figure it out
[11:29:20] <tab1293> Can somebody tell me how the long polling example here keeps an "open connection to the server"? https://gist.github.com/jasdeepkhalsa/4353139
[11:29:38] <tab1293> to me it just looks like an ajax request is constantly being made
[11:31:18] <justgage> Does anyone know why .append will only add one element in a loop? example: http://jsfiddle.net/zVw8Z/
[11:31:56] <thesisb> tab1293: in traditional polling a request is being fired every 30s regardless of completion before or after the 30s
[11:32:13] <MrPunkin> tab1293: from Wikipedia on Push technology's section about long polling: "With long polling, the client requests information from the server in a way similar to a normal polling; however, if the server does not have any information available for the client, then instead of sending an empty response, the server holds the request and waits for information to become available (or for a suitable timeout event), after whi
[11:32:14] <MrPunkin> complete response is finally sent to the client."
[11:32:19] <thesisb> so an update occurs on every 30s interval
[11:32:44] <thesisb> with the long polling approach, an ajax is fired latest every 30s, when it timesout, or when it receives something and completes sooner
[11:32:46] <MrPunkin> tab1293: the hope is to receive data before the 30s timeout, however if that doesn't take place it tries again to wait for something to happen
[11:34:39] <tab1293> okay but with long polling if the server responds right away another ajax request is immediately fired correct?
[11:35:23] <tab1293> MrPunkin and thesisb ^
[11:35:32] <thesisb> tab yes
[11:35:38] <thesisb> on complete it fires poll() again
[11:35:45] <thesisb> whether its a success / error/ timeout
[11:35:54] <thesisb> so a connection is always open technically
[11:35:56] <MrPunkin> tab1293: correct, to keep "polling". The idea is to replace a push environment with a faked system
[11:36:05] <tab1293> That just seems silly to me, wouldn't that overload the server with requests?
[11:36:16] <tab1293> MrPunkin, how would you emulate the push environment on the server side though?
[11:36:36] <thesisb> polling in general is inefficient, yes.
[11:36:45] <MrPunkin> tab1293: by only returning data when it's available, instead of returning blank data
[11:36:59] <MrPunkin> tab1293: a traditional poll would check x seconds and always receive a response
[11:37:14] <MrPunkin> so even if there isn't response to give, it will get a response and handle it
[11:37:15] <tab1293> MrPunkin, I guess long polling isn't the way I should go then because the returned data on my server should always be available
[11:37:24] <MrPunkin> so timeouts are shorter, such as like 5 seconds
[11:37:46] <MrPunkin> long polling replaces this method with the idea that it will only request at max every 30 seconds, or sooner if we have something to handle
[11:38:18] <MrPunkin> tab1293: what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:38:50] <MrPunkin> tab1293: if you know that you will always have data to give but can't afford the request per client per 30 seconds then you should setup a different timeline expectation for how often to update, re-render, whatever you want to do
[11:39:48] <tab1293> MrPunkin, I have remote torrent downloads happening on my server. Based on what the status is of the torrent (eg seeding, downloading, etc) I want an ajax request to be fired with on a certain interval
[11:40:07] <tab1293> the status of the torrent determines the interval
[11:40:22] <tab1293> right now I am using the traditional polling approach
[11:40:41] <MrPunkin> tab1293: how often for the most frequent ones?
[11:40:55] <tab1293> MrPunkin, right now 5 seconds
[11:41:31] <tab1293> so the server returns the timeout as well as the torrent data and I set the next interval with the returned timeout
[11:41:55] <tab1293> do you think this is the best way of going about it?
[11:42:00] <MrPunkin> tab1293: okay. and your goal is to limit responses from your server compared to how you have it now?
[11:42:31] <tab1293> well everything seems pretty fine right now, I was just wondering if there is a better way to do it
[11:42:35] <MrPunkin> tab1293: would you prefer it to only update when the torrent data changes?
[11:43:03] <tab1293> MrPunkin, that would be nice
[11:43:16] <Bloomberg> guys!!, someone has worked with fullcalendar?
[11:43:41] <MrPunkin> tab1293: that would be what long polling would be for, you could send via ajax the current data, and on your server compare that with what it would hand back. If it's the same just let it sit with no return until the 30 second timeout, if it changed return it as soon as it changes and re-start the timeout.
[11:44:10] <MrPunkin> tab1293: or just live with it how it is if it works for oyu
[11:44:23] <javalover> i'm so happy that i was a video game tester
[11:44:34] <javalover> because of it, i'm able to really test my code properly
[11:44:40] <javalover> and I gotta say, I LOVE THIS CODE!!
[11:44:42] <tab1293> MrPunkin, I may just end up living with it
[11:44:54] <MrPunkin> tab1293: not a terrible idea.
[11:44:55] <tab1293> seems like I would need to do major work on the backend
[11:44:57] <tab1293> yeah
[11:45:10] <MrPunkin> tab1293: yeah. You'd definitely need to change how the backend responds
[11:47:08] <tab1293> MrPunkin, let me send you some code because something strange happens with the first request. Regardless of the timeout returned on the first ajax the second request always happens 5 seconds after the first
[11:47:31] <MrPunkin> tab1293: Okay
[11:48:44] <tab1293> http://pastebin.ca/2443632
[11:48:47] <tab1293> MrPunkin, ^
[11:49:35] <tab1293> So the first request happens 5 seconds after the page is loaded and for example the timeout it returns will be 15 seconds, but the second request always happens 5 seconds after the first
[11:49:43] <tab1293> after the second request everything works though
[11:49:43] <MrPunkin> tab1293: what format is the response? JSON?
[11:49:47] <tab1293> yeah
[11:50:33] <tab1293> I mean its not a big deal, its just annoying me
[11:51:02] <MrPunkin> tab1293: and you have verified the first response JSON data that it is in milliseconds and not a string or something odd that could be causing issues with setTimeout?
[11:51:23] <tab1293> MrPunkin, yeah the timeout being returned is definitely correct
[11:51:49] <MrPunkin> tab1293: is it because the initial pollTorrents on document ready is triggered at 5 seconds?
[11:52:16] <MrPunkin> tab1293: I'm not seeing any clearTimeout here to remove any pending ones if it's re-called
[11:53:30] <tab1293> MrPunkin, well I don't need to clear it after the document ready one is called
[11:53:45] <justgage> hey guys, how do you store a copy of an element then use it multiple times in a loop
[11:54:03] <MrPunkin> tab1293: could it be a variable namespacing issue by chance?
[11:54:21] <MrPunkin> tab1293: maybe set a local variable within your pollTorrents with newTimeout instead of relying on resetting a global one?
[11:54:32] <tab1293> MrPunkin, okay ill play around with it
[11:56:38] <Cork> justgage: if you want to add an element multiple times you need to clone it
[11:56:55] <Cork> justgage: so just store it in a variable and do .clone() when you want to add a clone of it
[11:57:46] <justgage> like this var storeIt = $(".toClone").clone();
[11:58:59] <justgage> or like this => storeIt = $(".toClone"); soreIt.clone();
[12:00:54] <ppppp> hey a question for some of you experts
[12:01:15] <ppppp> I'm using jquery validation (http://jqueryvalidation.org/) and I want to put the error message some non-default. Like in an existing div or something
[12:01:17] <ppppp> any adivce?
[12:01:21] <ppppp> *advice
[12:02:00] <ppppp> by default it puts it right after the <input />
[12:03:11] <moura> if there any way to trigger a event on html()/append() completion?
[12:03:21] <justgage> Cork: Hm... the real problem seems to be with the loop, why does .append or .clone not work in a loop?
[12:03:36] <Cork> justgage: it does
[12:04:12] <ppppp> moura: hmm. I'm not looking for something in the jquery validation library. I suspect there's just an option for this
[12:04:37] <Cork> justgage: what you need to do is  var storeIt = $(".toClone"); loop> $(target).append(storeIt.clone())
[12:05:13] <moura> i'm using underscore i don't know if the _.template is asynchronous or not cause html i know it's not
[12:05:18] <Cork> justgage: the reason it wouldn't work without clone is cause each element is unique and unless you clone it, append will just move the old element
[12:05:38] <justgage> aaaah I see
[12:05:54] <justgage> Cork: thank you so much
[12:06:22] <Cork> np
[12:10:49] <ppppp> Cork: do you have experience with jquery validation?
[12:11:48] <Cork> ppppp: not much no
[12:12:10] <ppppp> ok, thanks though
[12:13:00] <Cork> ppppp: though you might be looking for the invalidhandler http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate
[12:16:54] <Cork> ppppp: alternatively look at errorPlacement
[12:26:49] <ppppp> sweet! errorPlacement is exactly what I was looking for
[12:26:53] <ppppp> perfect!
[12:35:53] <Aristata> Does anyone here have experience getting the formatting options to show up using aloha editor?
[12:36:23] <nhulea> howdy
[12:37:05] <nhulea> I was looking to create a function that increments a div by one everytime it is ran
[12:37:07] <sayd> i am using rcarousel (sucky but i need a carousel, fast) and i see all my content in a huge div (#carousel is like 2000+px wide)
[12:37:27] <sayd> nhulea: you can do that in css
[12:37:39] <nhulea> sayd really ?
[12:39:28] <sayd> nhulea: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Counters
[12:39:32] <nhulea> I wanted to display the val of a form element by appending a div with the results maybe I will just to that
[12:40:55] <master> I neeeds help with some Meat
[12:40:56] <master> http://www.amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/meat_science.html
[12:41:25] <Guest74826> why does my browser not delete all images when i do jQuery('img')
[12:42:19] <Guest74826> only some images are deleted from the page, but others remain. even document.getElementsByTagName(img) doesnt work to catch some images.
[12:42:46] <Guest74826> i AM manster
[12:46:36] <tieTYT> i'm making a cell phone game and I often reuse images by doing $(image).clone().show().  I notice in the FF console this prints a line about that image resource each time.  Is this actually redownloading the image every time I do this?  What's a more efficient way to use an image?
[12:57:52] <raj> I have `$(document).on('click', function(){alert('hi')})` and it's not working when clicking within a particular div. What could cause that line of code not to fire?
[13:02:06] <BillCriswell> raj: It could be another line of code keeping the event from bubbling to the document.
[13:03:29] <raj> BillCriswell, how can I find that code?
[13:04:31] <charan> raj, attach the event handler to the specific div and try instead of to the document
[13:04:42] <BillCriswell> raj: Search for .stopPropagation() in your code and see if that turns up anything.
[13:04:44] <raj> ok
[13:04:49] <BillCriswell> or what charan said.
[13:09:01] <Axel__> Is there a way to check in .toggle what state it will toggle into ?
[13:09:04] <raj> if I attach it to that exact div it fires
[13:09:15] <raj> , charan
[13:09:17] <Axel__> like $().toggle(function(state){})
[13:10:28] <zozeer> Hello, I am stuck and need some help.  All the googleing I have done points at using serializeObject to turn a form into an associative array.  However, I am unable to get it to produce anything at all.
[13:10:37] <charan> raj then there is some element in the parent elements that is stopping the event bubbling...its hard to figure out when multiple scripts are concatenated or loaded on the same page
[13:10:56] <charan> raj why do u need it attached to the document instead of specific div or its parent?
[13:12:04] <BillCriswell> raj: I'm thinking something like this is happening: http://jsbin.com/aWOWulu/1/
[13:14:11] <jugglinmike> zozeer: Do you mean "serialize"?
[13:14:35] <jugglinmike> jQuery has a "serialize" method that preforms that function, but nothing named "serializeObject"
[13:14:54] <BillCriswell> There's serializeArray().
[13:15:25] <BillCriswell> It's not an associative array though. It's an array of objects with name and value properties.
[13:15:38] <BillCriswell> Easy enough to get it into an "associative array" though.
[13:18:46] <zozeer> The info I have been working of of is here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1184624/convert-form-data-to-js-object-with-jquery/1186309#1186309  what I have in code is: http://pastebin.com/A0WV671r
[13:19:12] <zozeer> Though I am starting to wonder if I am missing something basic.
[13:19:37] <BillCriswell> zozeer: You're missing the serializeObject function from that SO question.
[13:20:28] <zozeer> its in the script, just didnt paste the whole js in.
[13:21:45] <BillCriswell> zozeer: You can just do .load( link, $(form).serialize(), stuff );
[13:22:00] <zozeer> is it really that simple?
[13:22:45] <BillCriswell> Yes. I'd think .serializeArray() would work as well, too.
[13:23:27] <BillCriswell> I'm 99.9% positive .serialize() will work, I'm like... 86.328% sure serializeArray() would as well.
[13:24:21] <zozeer> my server is handing back a 404...
[13:24:35] <BillCriswell> zozeer: That's a serious problem.
[13:24:43] <BillCriswell> well... road block?
[13:25:23] <zozeer> Not sure.  If I use the native form post it works.
[13:25:27] <zozeer> hrm.
[13:26:08] <zozeer> oh wait I found it!
[13:26:17] <zozeer> the back end is throwing a fit!
[13:26:21] <zozeer> I can fix that!
[13:26:49] <BillCriswell> Also, you should try to get out of the habit of inlining javascript like that.
[13:27:32] <BillCriswell> zozeer: Also, $('formname') should be $(formname)
[13:27:34] <RabSimpson> hi folks. i'm trying to create an infinite loop and what i have is crashing my browser (surprise surprise huh?). here's my code, any ideas?: http://pastebin.com/W2LtD2XX
[13:27:56] <RabSimpson> i previously jfiddle'd it but that crashed too
[13:28:15] <BillCriswell> RabSimpson: What is your goal?
[13:28:17] <zozeer> yeah I caught that too.  I have been messing with it all afternoon.
[13:28:58] <RabSimpson> billcriswell: simply an h1 with a background colour that changes over and over again without stopping.
[13:29:27] <RabSimpson> billcriswell: the code in my pastebin is REALLY simplistic
[13:29:32] <BillCriswell> RabSimpson: You should use setInterval() probably.
[13:30:09] <BillCriswell> or, ideally, CSS. ( depending on what you need to support )
[13:30:09] <RabSimpson> billcriswell: won't that introduce a pause? i want the changing to be constant, going from one colour to the other and back without stopping.
[13:31:36] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/OmavOH/1/ should be enough to get it how you want it?
[13:31:59] <BillCriswell> Oh wait I see your delay now.
[13:32:47] <RabSimpson> billcriswell: i'm going for a gradual change, not instant.
[13:32:59] <RabSimpson> hence the use of .animate and the duration
[13:33:08] <raj> BillCriswell, I'll look into it further when I'm in front of the computer
[13:33:26] <raj> I'm remotely accessing it right now and my tmobile 4g is running at Edge
[13:33:30] <BillCriswell> RabSimpson: Haha yeah I missed that.
[13:33:37] <RabSimpson> :)
[13:33:38] <raj> thank you both for your help
[13:34:31] <shoky> no, thank you, raj
[13:34:39] <sarmiena_> having trouble using qtip2's "tip" option. http://pastie.org/8298571
[13:35:00] <ech0s7> i have two pages like this http://pastebin.com/Pinku5De
[13:35:02] <ech0s7> why when i go to page2.html and return to page1.html (with href) download() function is not called ??
[13:35:03] <sarmiena_> not sure if this is the place to ask the question. but link above shows how i'm using it
[13:35:18] <ech0s7> it's called only first time that i load page1.html
[13:35:30] <BillCriswell> RabSimpson: Do you have a color plugin to handle that?
[13:35:44] <RabSimpson> i've just got jquery-ui loaded
[13:38:44] <MrPunkin> So is there a way to use triggerHandler when delegate was used to assign a namespaced submit handler to all forms?
[13:40:13] <RabSimpson> billcriswell: i've just got jquery-ui loaded
[13:40:15] <Rael> can you .append an element on the same line as an anchor link
[13:42:52] <BillCriswell> RabSimpson: http://jsbin.com/OmavOH/1/edit perhaps?
[13:44:27] <RabSimpson> billcriswell: that looks like it might just hit the spot, thanks :)
[13:50:33] <BillCriswell> We;cp,e!
[13:50:45] <BillCriswell> Niiiiiice.
[13:50:46] <BillCriswell> Welcome*
[14:00:59] <zozeer> I have a new one...  http://pastebin.com/0BYLJNmb  but the target div just blanks out.  I see the hand off from the server and its what I expect, but what am I missing now?
[14:01:16] <orzel> hello. I'm looking for a jquery widget which i thought would be common / easy to find. This is a widget displaying several div/html in loop with next and previous buttons. Something like the numerous 'carousel' on the web, but displaying only one item at the same time, and not optimized for images. Have you heard about such a thing ... ?
[14:01:54] <BillCriswell> zozeer: That's not how async works.
[14:02:43] <BillCriswell> zozeer: You'd want to do more along the lines of $.post( link, data, function( response ){ target.empty().append( response ); });
[14:02:47] <myosotis> zozeer, you are missing the fact that your post call returns immediately, and allows the rest of the code to execute while the network request is in progress
[14:03:21] <myosotis> as BillCriswell wrote, you need to put your code in a place that gets run once the request is complete
[14:04:23] <zozeer> so I am using data before data exists.
[14:04:26] <zozeer> Right.
[14:05:06] <BillCriswell> Yes. If you're waiting for something you have to use callbacks.
[14:05:57] <ech0s7> http://pastebin.com/G2E8SBhN
[14:06:20] <ech0s7> when i click on page 2 href, download function() is called another time, why ???
[14:07:18] <BillCriswell> ech0s7: That's just how that event seems to work: http://api.jquerymobile.com/pageinit/
[14:07:41] <BillCriswell> It looks like you can limit it to certain pages. I'm not familiar enough with jQuery mobile to help out much more though. =)
[14:08:21] <zozeer> this is what I came up with: http://pastebin.com/MzeFV4VQ It looks like it works now...
[14:08:48] <BillCriswell> zozeer: Well look what happens when you approach it properly :-p
[14:09:02] <BillCriswell> Just kidding, EVERYONE has tried it the way you initially set it up.
[14:09:40] <zozeer> So it looks good now?  My learning curve on this has been less than ideal...
[14:09:48] <v1king> How can I change the close button text on a ui dialog?
[14:10:51] <BillCriswell> zozeer: That's how you'd want to approach it for sure.
[14:14:01] <grafi> boop
[14:17:35] <BillCriswell> boop.
[14:18:33] <zozeer> BillCriswell thanks.  I think I need some outside time now.
[14:18:44] <BillCriswell> zozeer: We all do I'm sure.
[14:19:24] <grafi> what
[14:19:27] <grafi> OUTSIDE?!!!
[14:19:32] <grafi> can I take my laptop?
[14:19:36] <grafi> :x
[14:20:43] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[14:21:06] <shoky> bazoop
[14:21:31] <BillCriswell> grafi: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkVfWlEgYug reminds me of this situation
[14:22:52] <BillCriswell> grafi: It fits in REALLY well actually.
[14:23:08] <BillCriswell> Luckily, what I need is in the preview section haha.
[14:25:12] <BillCriswell> "It's god damn bright out here"
[14:25:44] <grafi> it is
[14:25:47] <grafi> even now
[14:25:52] <grafi> where its dark outside
[14:25:59] <BillCriswell> haha
[14:27:05] <BillCriswell> Now we're all watching this at work.
[14:27:08] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[14:28:52] <grafi> Dont get caught
[14:32:35] <v1king> How do I modify the close button on a ui dialog?
[14:33:30] <BillCriswell> v1king: I'd think through the CSS? I feel like there's more to your question, though.
[14:35:05] <v1king> Well yes, right now it says 'close' and I'm wondering if I can pass an option to the dialog create or something to make that have a different value? Aside from hiding that button and using css to prepend content to it or something.. but that kind of feels hack-y
[14:36:28] <BillCriswell> v1king: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-buttons this help?
[14:36:41] <grafi> check api always

[14:39:05] <v1king> Hmm, isn't that more intended at the buttons displayed by the dialog in the content area? I'm referring to the close button in the title bar
[14:40:30] <shoky> v1king: http://jsfiddle.net/8CtNt/
[14:41:12] <BillCriswell> I thought it was an X by default.
[14:41:25] <shoky> er.. also  http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-closeText
[14:41:34] <grafi> wohoo
[14:41:39] <grafi> api 1 shoky 0
[14:41:40] <grafi> <:
[14:41:48] <shoky> ;p
[14:46:34] <v1king> hmm. that's totally not how it performs on my system..
[14:46:38] <v1king> *shrug*
[14:49:23] <zuloyd> hi
[14:49:45] <zuloyd> is it possible to specify the slideDown duration in proportion to the height? i.e. something like 100px per second
[15:11:03] <dewp> doug65536, thanks & good night
[15:27:33] <v1king> What's the correct way to chain this together? $("section#newNotebookDialog span.message").addClass("good").text("Notebook added.").$("#notebookNameAdd span#submitButton").html("").delay(5).$('#newNotebookDialog').dialog('close')
[15:27:59] <v1king> I'm guessing $("section#newNotebookDialog span.message").addClass("good").text("Notebook added."); $("#notebookNameAdd span#submitButton").html("").delay(5); $('#newNotebookDialog').dialog('close') or something? that doesnt work either :/
[15:31:32] <clarkk> could someone tell me what the plus symbol is on this line, please?  https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/dist/js/bootstrap.js#L30
[15:32:00] <v1king> got it, my ordering was off
[15:32:31] <v1king> err nevermind, that just doesn't work at all
[15:32:38] <clarkk> v1king: what is the delay for?
[15:32:52] <v1king> clarkk: Delay before the dialog closes
[15:32:57] <v1king> I realize it should be 5000 not 5
[15:33:02] <v1king> (after reading the doc)
[15:33:32] <v1king> but I'm still unsure of the correct way to chain them
[15:33:49] <v1king> I'm currenty at $("section#newNotebookDialog span.message").addClass("good").text("Notebook added."); $("#notebookNameAdd span#submitButton").html(""); $('#newNotebookDialog').delay(5000).dialog('close'); which additionally doesn't work heh
[15:33:55] <clarkk> v1king: please put it in fiddle
[15:34:08] <clarkk> pasting that code here is bound to go wrong
[15:34:21] <clarkk> and it's too noisy
[15:35:20] <v1king> Understandable, will do.
[15:35:39] <clarkk> v1king: what is .html("") for?
[15:36:51] <v1king> clarkk: blanking the loading gif
[15:37:49] <clarkk> v1king: have you considered empty(), remove() or detach() ?
[15:38:19] <v1king> empty() would work, yeah, I'll change it.
[15:38:43] <v1king> But regardless, how do I go about executing multiple actions to different selectors (novice question, I know)
[15:39:01] <clarkk> v1king: have you put it in fiddle?
[15:39:02] <v1king> This is all within the done() callback function of an ajax call
[15:39:38] <v1king> No I haven't, I think my question is a little too simple for a fiddle, although I can set something up if really needed (I have no expierence with jsfiddle heh)
[15:40:11] <v1king> sorry if I'm being ignorant!
[15:40:14] <clarkk> v1king: I can look at your chaining, but I am not going to look at the code you've posted here, I'm afraid
[15:40:34] <clarkk> v1king: no, your question is not at all ignorant. The way you are presenting it is, a little ;)
[15:41:03] <v1king> Understandable. Alright, let me try to get it working in fiddle..
[15:41:22] <lnormous> Can anyone help me with stripping some html from some text. I have the following text: http://pastebin.com/q7tKA5Tu I know how to strip out the html, but not the text between the <style> tags
[15:41:23] <clarkk> v1king: just put the code there to start with
[15:41:26] <v1king> something like this http://jsfiddle.net/tCkpT/
[15:44:29] <clarkk> v1king: click the TidyUp button, and then the JSHint button
[15:44:44] <clarkk> v1king: then update, and share the link
[15:45:27] <v1king> alrighty, http://jsfiddle.net/tCkpT/1/
[15:45:48] <clarkk> v1king: fix the error ;)
[15:46:15] <v1king> the lack of semicolon? that could cause the issue? o.O
[15:46:17] * v1king checks
[15:46:35] <clarkk> nope it won't cause an issue, but it's best to resovle all the easy issues first
[15:47:38] <v1king> ah, yes, alright. http://jsfiddle.net/tCkpT/2/
[15:48:23] <clarkk> v1king: what is the behaviour at the moment, and what do you want?
[15:49:07] <v1king> right now after the ajax call returns, the dialog closes immediately. I'd like it to update the message span, empty span#submitButton, wait 5 seconds, then close the dialog box
[15:50:23] <clarkk> v1king: what is "done" - I thought it was "success"?
[15:51:15] <clarkk> v1king: what is fail? Isn't it error?
[15:52:02] <v1king> err I am getting that directly from the doc.. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:56:06] <clarkk> v1king: is dialog a jquery effect?
[15:56:36] <v1king> jquery ui, yeah
[15:58:09] <clarkk> v1king: I am not sure it is
[15:58:22] <clarkk> v1king: fadeIn/fadeOut are effects
[15:58:38] <clarkk> v1king: what browser are you testing on?
[15:59:38] <v1king> well, not an effect, it's a "method" / "function" (not sure the right word here)
[15:59:39] <v1king> chrome.
[16:00:06] <clarkk> try in firefox, to see if it's working as expected in chrome
[16:00:39] <v1king> alrighty i'll test in firefox
[16:02:22] <clarkk> v1king: you could use setTimeout, or instead, fadeIn to display it and fadeOut with a delay(5000) to hide it
[16:02:29] <clarkk> v1king: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-close-automatically-dialog-after-x-seconds
[16:02:55] <v1king> interesting. it works fine when i remove the dialog('close')
[16:02:59] <v1king> alright, i'll take a look
[16:03:00] <v1king> thanks
[16:03:01] <v1king> :)
[16:03:15] <clarkk> yw v1king - remember to use fiddle next time ;)
[16:05:05] <v1king> alrighty, it's working with settimeout. I'll make it a note to improve my fiddle-adaptation skills, thanks for all the help clarkk! much appreciated
[16:05:34] <clarkk> v1king: no worries, you are very welcome. Good luck :)
[16:20:13] <petebwhat> Hey all… having an issue passing a value through to an autocomplete script...
[16:20:14] <petebwhat> http://jsfiddle.net/4KxjD/
[16:20:27] <petebwhat> The top doesn't work -- trying to pass a value from a form field, but the bottom does… if I just put in text. Any ideas?
[16:24:37] <tapmodo>   public function event($event_id = null){
[16:24:37] <tapmodo>       $show_all = (isset($params['pass'][1])) ? true : false;
[16:25:13] <tapmodo> oops sorry guys... wrong window
[16:39:20] <T0w3ntuM> (T0w3ntuM) What is the best method to wait for ajax calls to complete before doing more work? My ajax call sets html class and tags that cant be acted on until loaded in the dom
[16:40:19] <grafi> T0w3ntuM look up $.when / $.then
[16:41:42] <T0w3ntuM> Currently all my code runs in the function of getajax
[16:42:41] <T0w3ntuM> I think i tries when and then but it didn't seem to work. How i have it now works...just probably not best practice.
[16:43:18] <grafi> yeah
[16:59:38] <guideX> jquery 1.5 and ie7... I can't set a background-image using jquery
[17:00:49] <guideX> things like $(".ie7 .items").css("background-image", "none"); aren't working
[17:05:06] <snover> whatever you are doing where you are browser sniffing that, stop right now.
[17:06:22] <guideX> well I have to.. ie7, ie8 render differently
[17:06:29] <guideX> only ie do I sniff
[17:06:41] <snover> i can pretty much guarantee that you don’t.
[17:07:54] <guideX> ah ok.. so how do I set the background image with ie7? everything I try isn't working..
[17:07:59] <guideX> .. err to none
[17:08:37] <doug65536> guideX: .css('background', '')
[17:09:13] <doug65536> guideX: .css('background-image', '')
[17:11:47] <guideX> hmm that doesn't appear to be working in chrome or ie
[17:12:03] <guideX> let me keep trying though..
[17:12:16] <T0w3ntuM> Do you guys find it easier to work with json or xml? I'm using jquery to get json from a php script and populate a table.
[17:12:51] <guideX> .css('background-image','url(none)'); works in chrome, but noe ie7
[17:13:18] <guideX> T0w3ntuM: php: json, asp.net: xml (personally)
[17:14:23] <T0w3ntuM> I don't know any asp.net so that's good then lol
[17:14:42] <T0w3ntuM> Then again i hardly know JavaScript
[17:16:15] <T0w3ntuM> I'll admit i get confused by the syntax sometimes.
[17:16:43] <T0w3ntuM> I just haven't found a way to relate to it yet.
[17:16:59] <snover> guideX: stop. explain what you are actually trying to do where you think it has to be different in ie7.
[17:17:52] <guideX> snover: the reason I have the ie7 tag is because the background image is positioned differently in ie7
[17:18:15] <snover> then you probably need to trigger layout on its container.
[17:18:16] <guideX> it shows up in an unexpected spot, so I correct the position with css...
[17:18:30] <snover> that is the wrong solution.
[17:19:17] <guideX> ah ok.. well how do I fix the other issue, of ie7 not changing the background image to none?
[17:19:29] <guideX> the positioning issue is just 1 of 2 ie7 issue
[17:19:40] <snover> why are you trying to change it only in ie?
[17:19:51] <guideX> in chrome and ff it is already working
[17:19:59] <guideX> in ie7, the background image does not change to none
[17:20:04] <guideX> it in fact won't change to anything
[17:22:14] <guideX> i'd show a jsfiddle, but jsfiddle also doesn't work in ie7
[17:22:20] <T0w3ntuM> You can check browser in the HTML and load specific css that way.
[17:28:16] <equinox_> how do I find a regex to match /items/'some integer number here'/'some string' ?
[17:29:08] <equinox_> how do I write
[17:29:10] <equinox_> not find
[17:29:15] <guideX> damn i'm really struggling..
[17:29:26] <guideX> I can't believe how hard it is to do something this simple with ie7
[17:31:27] <_rgn> equinox_: your example is confusing
[17:31:49] <equinox_> _rgn: so a real example would be this string /items/1836/Shell-Detachable-Collar-in-blue-and-white
[17:31:55] <equinox_> '/items/1836/Shell-Detachable-Collar-in-blue-and-white'
[17:32:11] <equinox_> but the format is ' /items/'some integer number here'/'some string' ?
[17:32:21] <equinox_> the items string always stays constant
[17:35:29] <_rgn>  /\/items\/\d+\/[\w-]+/
[17:35:46] <jp-> (\d+) if you want the number
[17:37:36] <jp-> http://jsfiddle.net/eGMM2/
[17:38:34] <_rgn> did you read his mind because i can't see him saying anything about grabbing the number
[17:38:49] <equinox_> what does match returns if it matches
[17:38:50] <jp-> he said match the number.
[17:39:30] <_rgn> equinox_: you have javascript console you can use to figure that out
[17:39:36] <equinox_> k
[17:39:45] <guideX> wow this works, cool... really had to dig the bottom of the internet for this one..  $('.ie7 .item').css({backgroudImage: 'url(/images/whitepixel.jpg)'});
[17:40:07] <_rgn> jp-: dont see that, you must be psychic
[17:45:09] <guideX> actually nm, that isn't working either..
[17:45:49] <doug65536> guideX: did you try what I said?
[17:46:49] <doug65536> guideX: backgroudImage: is misspelled
[17:46:51] <guideX> yeah that doesn't work in either browser
[17:47:00] <guideX> spelled out correctly..
[17:47:22] <guideX> in chrome at least you need to add url(none) before it'll work
[17:52:33] <doug65536> guideX: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rhQdg/
[17:53:35] <guideX> cool this works good in chrome, but not in ie7
[18:01:22] <guideX> wait! it is working now, thanks a million doug655536
[18:02:25] <guideX> ... was pulling my hair out
[18:21:00] <Ownix> When I try to replace _layout/js/jquery-1.3.1.min. with _layout/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js my code stops working. I have ensured 1.10.2 exists.
[18:21:04] <Ownix> What could cause this?
[18:22:02] <guideX> could be a lot of reasons
[18:22:23] <guideX> why do you need 1.10
[18:22:56] <guideX> maybe you could substitute the one or two things you need out of 1.10
[18:23:05] <guideX> might be easier
[18:23:30] <Ownix> I want to use delay()
[18:23:49] <Ownix> My jquery is very very simple: http://pastie.org/8299198
[18:23:52] <Ownix> guideX: ^
[18:24:24] <Ownix> I want to use:         $("#flip-work").delay(1500).fadeOut(400);
[18:24:44] <Ownix> delay isnt supported till 1.4 so I figure I might as well be using and learning on the latest
[18:24:46] <guideX> oic
[18:25:06] <guideX> using javascript settimeout instead
[18:25:10] <guideX> to work aroundm the issue
[18:25:20] <Ownix> instead of using the latest JQ?
[18:25:43] <Ownix> id rather change what is now depreciated in my code to use current features than work around old depreciated code
[18:26:02] <guideX> are other areas of the site using jquery?
[18:26:16] <Ownix> nope, its a one page site
[18:26:21] <Ownix> its a personal site for my resume
[18:26:22] <guideX> hmm
[18:26:25] <Ownix> This is the only jquery
[18:26:54] <guideX> I don't see why your old code won't work with newer jquery
[18:26:57] <guideX> looks ok to me
[18:27:08] <zippy__> Would I use a plugin to attach methods to elements? on a table row I want to have a method like, calculate total which takes quantity column and * it by a price column, but I am really not 100% sure
[18:27:30] <guideX> do you get js errors
[18:27:40] <guideX> in the console
[18:28:25] <Ownix> ill look
[18:29:19] <guideX> ok
[18:29:45] <tieTYT2> I'm adding an image to an element like this: $(root.resources.character).clone().show()  and when I look at the html in firefox it has a style="display:ineline;" on it.  The thing I'm copying from doesn't.  How did that get there?
[18:30:10] <tieTYT2> "display: inline", I meant
[18:32:23] <Ownix> guideX: had some old lightbox code in there that was causing an issue. Works like a charm now
[18:33:03] <tieTYT2> oh i guess this is what show() does
[18:33:39] <guideX> ah cool
[18:33:58] <guideX> stinking js errors :)
[18:43:52] <zippy__> exit
[18:43:55] <zippy__> lol
[18:44:16] <equinox_> inside my input tag
[18:44:21] <equinox_> I have the following validation
[18:44:22] <equinox_>  validate[required,minSize[3], ajax[ajaxUsernameCall]]
[18:44:26] <equinox_> how can I trigger the validation
[19:02:28] <durango> Is there anyway to make a draggable move it's parent element too?
[19:28:21] <v1king> I have a modal box, how can I make it so that when I click on the overlay it closes the modal? Right now I have a click function setup on .ui-widget-overlay to close any .ui-dialog (http://pastebin.com/RxLdxKCr), but that doesn't work. any ideas?
[20:11:06] <danheberden> v1king you could just capture click events on document and see if they originated inside of the modal or not
[20:38:43] <thmcmahon> hi all, i'm trying to remove a <p> element that contains <div>'s, I can remove the <p> when it doesn't contain the divs, but not when it does.
[20:45:18] <pixelpimp> thmcmahon: your <div>s aren't allowed inside the <p> so it's creating an adjacent sibling, so the selector would be different
[20:46:56] <pixelpimp> <p>one<div>two</div>three</p> renders as in chrome <p>one</p><div>two</div>three<p></p>
[20:53:39] <uknownalgorithms> can someone help me figure out why my If statement for AJAX post seems to be failing? This is the script in question (http://pastebin.com/EdE37fvb) which POSTS to this PHP script (http://pastebin.com/uExT4AD5). I have it all setup at this URL(http://uptownpcrepair.com/ambulette/)
[20:55:38] <thmcmahon> pixelpimp: ah ok so I can't nest a <div> inside a <p>, how should I do this then, the <div> is to style it using bootstrap
[20:55:57] <pixelpimp> use something other than a <p>
[20:56:54] <thmcmahon> pixelpimp: ok, what would you suggest, essentially the <p> is just a placeholder. apologies for the ultra noob questions
[20:57:17] <pixelpimp> <div>, maybe
[20:57:37] <thmcmahon> pixelpimp: ok, i'll go have a play and see what I can manage
[20:57:39] <thmcmahon> pixelpimp: thanks
[20:59:00] <p3lim> Maybe one of you have a clue why background-position is getting ignored here: http://jsfiddle.net/xGkJE/1/
[20:59:16] <thmcmahon> pixelpimp: works now, thanks a lot!
[21:04:43] <equinox_> I have the following code: http://pastebin.com/QcxXYZBF, which appends an element to another element
[21:04:49] <equinox_> how do I then remove the appended element
[21:04:50] <equinox_> later on
[21:05:00] <equinox_> I have $('#registerModal').find('input[type=submit]').parent.remove();, but that didn't work
[21:16:45] <equinox_> anyone?
[21:25:27] <Palanivel> Hi Good Morning all
[21:26:11] <Palanivel> I have a one interesting clarification and topic
[21:27:36] <Palanivel> Without keyboard how to fire the press 'a' character button by using jquery
[21:28:22] <Palanivel> Please help me out if any one aware about this things
[21:30:50] <schu> hi. i'm trying to create full-screen moving panels with jquery ui but whenever i apply a slide effect to my 100% height and width divs, there is some kind of glitch where the sliding panel goes down some pixels (approx. 20) and then slides away. i already tried to modify the ui-effects-wrapper but no luck...
[21:51:33] <sheilablackrose> hi guys i have something like <table><tbody><tr class="parent"></tr></tbody><tbody><tr></tr><tr class="here"></tr><.tbody>  how can i get to the parrent tr from here?
[22:01:16] <thump_> Hi, is it correct to do function( $.trim(data) ) { // data in here is now trimmed }
[22:04:19] <uknownalgorithms> Can anyone tell me why my .ajax Post is failing on my web server but not on my local host? The live site in question http://uptownpcrepair.com , a link to the ajax post request : http://jsbin.com/ixEguhO/1/edit
[22:04:56] <uknownalgorithms> I'm attempting to POST a  contact form via .ajax, you can see it on the http://uptownpcrepair.com site when you click contact us
[22:07:37] <BillCriswell> thump_: If data is the name of the first argument for the function, yes.
[22:08:37] <thump_> BillCriswell: yes so I don't need to keep doing $.trim(data) within {} ?
[22:09:04] <BillCriswell> thump_: No.
[22:10:09] <thump_> BillCriswell: What's the advantage of doing it in ($.trim(data)?
[22:10:30] <BillCriswell> thump_: You don't have to remember to trim it when you're using it.
[22:10:39] <sheilablackrose> how do i travel upwards to find a class regardless of what type of element?
[22:10:54] <BillCriswell> sheilablackrose: .closest('.something')
[22:11:14] <sheilablackrose> billcriswell - it doesnt work the layout is a little weird
[22:11:18] <sheilablackrose> i have something lik ethis
[22:11:26] <sheilablackrose>  <table><tbody><tr class="parent"></tr></tbody><tbody><tr></tr><tr class="here"></tr><.tbody>  how can i get to the parrent tr from here?
[22:11:43] <thump_> BillCriswell: OK
[22:11:45] <sheilablackrose> so is there away to get to parent
[22:12:00] <sheilablackrose> i tried .closest('.parent')
[22:12:36] <BillCriswell> thump_: var foo = function( stringToTrim ){ stringToTrim = $.trim( stringToTrim ); ... };
[22:13:51] <BillCriswell> sheilablackrose: Hmmm...
[22:14:14] <thump_> BillCriswell: What's the point of doing var foo = function(){}?
[22:14:19] <sheilablackrose> any idea?
[22:16:15] <BillCriswell> thump_: I mostly just do it out of habit.
[22:16:45] <thump_> BillCriswell: I'm new. What's the point of it. Any advantages?
[22:17:35] <BillCriswell> thump_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/336859/var-functionname-function-vs-function-functionname explained here way better than I could.
[22:17:54] <BillCriswell> sheilablackrose: Is there only one parent?
[22:18:04] <BillCriswell> only one .parent *
[22:18:23] <sheilablackrose> its kinda like this
[22:18:31] <sheilablackrose> there is 1 table
[22:18:51] <sheilablackrose> with a lot of <tbody></tbody>
[22:18:55] <thump_> BillCriswell: I find explaining things to others help me concrete my understanding of a concept. Thanks for link
[22:19:06] <sheilablackrose> there are two parents one for income and one for expenses
[22:19:12] <BillCriswell> thump_: Agreed. You're welcome!
[22:19:24] <dcrouch> I'm getting the retun on first tab, and code on second tab.  I'm trying to get a json structure back.  Not sure what I'm doing wrong.  Can I have some assistance?  http://thunked.org/p/view/pri/58dqp5yxq
[22:20:23] <sheilablackrose> so i could be somewhere like this <table><tbody><tr parent></tr><tr><tbody><tbody><tr></tr></tbody><tbody><tr parent></tr></tbod><tbody><tr here></tr></tbody>
[22:20:28] <sheilablackrose> so i would need the closest parent
[22:22:07] <BillCriswell> sheilablackrose: Is is always in the previous <tr>?
[22:22:17] <BillCriswell> in the previous <tbody>*
[22:23:09] <sheilablackrose> yeah
[22:23:19] <sheilablackrose> but could be a few previous away
[22:23:48] <BillCriswell> So.. first previous with a .parent?
[22:23:52] <uknownalgorithms> why is my .ajax post request failing, i've tested the url and it works in my xampp localhost.. Live url :http://uptownpcrepair.com/ click contact us to see the form i'm failing to submit
[22:24:06] <__elek> what events fire when the browser is maximized?  I can't seem to get visibilitychange to fire when you click on the maximize button in chrome (windows)
[22:24:21] <BillCriswell> dcrouch: Are you running like html entities or something on it?
[22:24:40] <sheilablackrose> yup
[22:24:45] <BillCriswell> __elek: resize?
[22:25:31] <BillCriswell> sheilablackrose: This HTML is pretty terrible, should never have to go through this much work for this.
[22:25:38] <dcrouch> BillCriswell, huh?  There is a django backend that's returning hours as a dictionary / key value pair.  And yes there is an html template I'm pulling from.
[22:25:57] <sheilablackrose> yeah i know
[22:26:00] <sheilablackrose> but i have no control over it
[22:26:04] <sheilablackrose> its using some accordion
[22:28:01] <__elek> BillCriswell, it doesnt fire on maximize
[22:28:32] <BillCriswell> dcrouch: It looks like it's running something to make the quoates into html entities.
[22:28:33] <__elek> actually it is..
[22:28:40] <__elek> thanks
[22:29:10] <dcrouch> BillCriswell, url encoding?
[22:29:21] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[22:29:24] <BillCriswell> __elek: Awesome.
[22:29:34] <BillCriswell> dcrouch: Ah, sorry, no.
[22:29:37] <dcrouch> BillCriswell,  not intentionally, LOL.  :(
[22:33:02] <BillCriswell> sheilablackrose: http://jsbin.com/ayEGaVa/1/ best I could think of at 1:30am
[22:33:52] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[22:36:13] <BillCriswell> Welcome. Does that make sense?
[22:36:47] <sheilablackrose> yeah i kind get what you did
[22:36:55] <sheilablackrose> im trying to incoorperate that in my code
[22:39:07] <BillCriswell> Ok cool. Good luck!
[22:39:17] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[22:39:18] <sheilablackrose> :)
[22:39:45] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[23:08:00] <neworder> Hi guys
[23:08:11] <neworder> I used ajax and passed some data using POST
[23:08:15] <neworder> to another page
[23:08:35] <neworder> How can I check that the data has been successfully posted to the other page
[23:08:43] <neworder> In firebug
[23:08:53] <neworder> it shows that a post request has been made
[23:09:02] <Cork> neworder: net tab > connection > response header
[23:09:07] <neworder> But I want to make sure that it's received on the other end
[23:09:12] <neworder> hmm
[23:09:15] <neworder> I see
[23:09:17] <Cork> if the server returns 200 it "should" be successful
[23:09:19] <cygo> wouldn't it be request header?
[23:09:29] <Cork> no request is what the browser does
[23:09:38] <Cork> request won't know how the server made it
[23:10:45] <cygo> but maybe he didn't even post it
[23:11:03] <Cork> well then you won't have a request at all
[23:11:19] <cygo> i think it's more useful to see what you posted to check
[23:11:45] <Cork> well if you want to know if the server handled it successfully, the request data is pointless
[23:12:15] <Cork> if you want to knw WHY the server failed, it's another matter though
[23:12:15] <cygo> maybe we are both right
[23:15:57] <neworder> thanks, it says Status: 200 OK
[23:16:01] <neworder> However, in the respone
[23:16:05] <neworder> it says
[23:16:31] <neworder> ohh
[23:16:33] <neworder> wait
[23:16:40] <neworder> I think I know why =D
[23:29:14] <javalover> okay so I was wondering if I could make my jquery faster
[23:29:26] <javalover> basically right now I have a .get function which returns html
[23:29:39] <javalover> the returning of the html takes time
[23:30:01] <javalover> so I was curious, could I instead of running .get a bunch of times run it 1 time & store the string of html
[23:30:14] <javalover> and I can but heres the issue
[23:30:33] <javalover> how can I say like give me the first chunk of the html  do I have to use substring?
[23:30:44] <javalover> or is there idk a way to mark it or something?
[23:31:36] <Cork> javalover: if .get takes time cause of network latency and the speed of the server
[23:31:42] <Cork> it has little to do with jquery
[23:31:47] <javalover> right I agree
[23:31:53] <javalover> but how I interact with the response is my question
[23:32:05] <javalover> so say I have a jquery object which has like 50 posts
[23:32:13] <javalover> how could I ask for say the first 10
[23:32:25] <Cork> javalover: that would be something that depends on the server
[23:32:26] <javalover> if given the object I have is a .get response, which i'm assuming is a string
[23:32:44] <Cork> javalover: you can send parameters in the data section
[23:32:46] <javalover> no trust me cork it's interacting with a string of html
[23:33:05] <Cork> javalover: are you telling me you are loading a static html file?
[23:33:09] <javalover> yeah
[23:33:11] <javalover> well php
[23:33:14] <Cork> then your out of luck
[23:33:19] <javalover> why?
[23:33:20] <Cork> then it isn't static
[23:33:31] <Cork> you need to send a parameter to the server (php)
[23:33:34] <javalover> cork it's like this
[23:33:36] <javalover> no just listen
[23:33:41] <Cork> and the server needs to limit it response size
[23:33:45] <javalover> so I return from my .get() the data response
[23:33:52] <javalover> and I store that as a variable
[23:34:08] <javalover> what I want to do is take the first 10 posts from that variable, i think it's a string at this point
[23:34:08] <Cork> javalover: if you limit the size client size it won't change anything in time
[23:34:27] <Cork> cause 1. the server will still have to send everything, 2. the network still have to transfer everything
[23:34:35] <javalover> yeah but
[23:34:40] <javalover> not dispalying is faster cuz it's images
[23:34:41] <Cork> all you would get is that when all the data arrives you would throw some of it away
[23:34:54] <javalover> wait hold up phone call
[23:34:55] <Cork> images load after you append the html to the page
[23:34:58] <Cork> they are loaded async
[23:35:00] <javalover> but thx anyway cork just talking has helped me
[23:35:04] <Cork> that shouldn't affect the speed
[23:35:06] <javalover> and i'll read over what you wrote but htis is business
[23:35:08] <javalover> gotta take this
[23:35:12] <javalover> thx a lot though I appreciate it
[23:35:13] <javalover> :-)
[23:57:04] <Jac0bz1> Anyone  that have a second? I'm trying to clone some form fields, but the name of the field is deltagere[gruppe][0] . Is there a clever way to change the name when cloning it to deltagere[gruppe][INCREASE THE NUMBER]
