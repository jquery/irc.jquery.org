[00:00:05] <AdamPDotty> I believe, only simple selectors work in on(), not 'li a'.
[00:05:37] <danheberden> funny, http://api.jquery.com/on/ doesn't mention "simple selectors"
[00:06:20] <danheberden> well, it does in the sense that they would be faster
[00:06:47] <peipst> and also kind of more dynamic, because when afterwads another li gets added, you dont need to attach another event handler
[00:07:30] <danheberden> yeah, but wouldn't $('#idOfTheULElement').on('click', 'a', fn... be just as efficient peipst?
[00:07:38] <didiergm> AdamPDotty I don"t see why 'on' would be different as I guess it is using the same Sizzle engine as the rest of JQ
[00:07:55] <peipst> yes danheberden was just simple example ;)
[00:08:01] <danheberden> didiergm AdamPDotty the answer, surprisingly, is in the docs :) http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:09:32] <danheberden> peipst: you can also wager if checking yourself is easier, e.g., you know that the 'a' element you want will always be a child of an li, you can just do $('#el').on('click', 'a', function(e){ if ( $(this).parent().is('li')  or something
[00:09:40] <danheberden> if you are looking for that much speed
[00:09:50] <danheberden> chances are, however, the browser will be plenty fast for whatever you throw at it
[00:11:27] <peipst> danheberden except for internet explorer haha
[00:11:52] <danheberden> well, ie6-8 at least
[00:12:05] <danheberden> but either way, your site visitors are already screwed :)
[00:13:05] <peipst> yea but im good with that, im developing for an intranet were everyone is forced to use firefox :D
[00:13:14] <dailylinux> Good morning
[00:13:23] <dailylinux> I'm very new to JS and getting some error i can't see from where:  http://jsfiddle.net/3MQ3T/1/
[00:13:23] <peipst> good morning
[00:13:30] <dailylinux> peipst, morning
[00:14:22] <dailylinux> I'm trying to rewrite a function from a FOSS project to use keypress (enter) rather than autocompleting usernames.
[00:15:16] <peipst> well you have a backslash character in your $.get line which causes javascript shut down
[00:16:13] <dailylinux> ah, that's just my emacs which i pasted from
[00:16:16] <dailylinux> removed*
[00:16:31] <dailylinux> http://jsfiddle.net/3MQ3T/2/
[00:16:58] <peipst> there is another one in line 13
[00:17:00] <dailylinux> i should rather pastebin the original function i'm trying to change
[00:17:11] <tw2113> nothing wrong with Firefox peipst
[00:17:19] <peipst> you should use /* */ for multiline comments
[00:17:26] <dailylinux> ok
[00:17:42] <peipst> tw2113, nah, im happy to force my users to firefox and ignore IE support :)
[00:18:05] <tw2113> now if you were daring or feeling potentially assholish, you'd force them all to Firefox Aurora
[00:18:17] <peipst> what is firefox aurora
[00:18:29] <tw2113> their alpha channel
[00:18:38] <tw2113> one step more stable than nightly
[00:19:00] <peipst> it looks like FF19 just with Firefox label changed to Aurora :D
[00:19:01] <dailylinux> http://jsfiddle.net/aQAnv/ is the one i'm trying to change with keypress == 13 (Enter)
[00:19:18] <tw2113> i got bumped up to version 21 yesterday
[00:19:54] <peipst> 21? are you on nightly channel?
[00:20:01] <tw2113> it's how i do. Run alpha for my daily browser with Firefox, if i feel need to touch chrome, open canary
[00:20:07] <tw2113> nightly would be on 22
[00:20:15] <dailylinux> peipst ^
[00:22:24] <peipst> dailylinux, change 'keypress' to 'keydown' and depending on your version switch to jquery 1.7 .on() function if possible
[00:24:19] <dailylinux> peipst, ok. using jquery 1.7.2.min
[00:25:13] <dailylinux> peipst, .on() instead of .live() ?
[00:25:30] <peipst> yes
[00:25:47] <peipst> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:25:53] <dailylinux> thx
[00:26:14] <peipst> .live is deprecated and some when removed
[00:26:31] <dailylinux> i see
[00:27:13] <tw2113> i think it was removed in 1.9
[00:30:10] <dailylinux> http://jsfiddle.net/Re8te/, looks like i need to include search and responce in the function (e)
[00:34:32] <peipst> tw2113, any idea how i can capture clicks which are outside of div#x ?
[00:34:47] <tw2113> nope
[00:34:49] <peipst> i got an overlay i want to close when user clicks somewhere else
[00:34:59] <peipst> this is driving me crazy
[00:35:12] <tw2113> dive into some lightbox plugin
[00:35:23] <peipst> impossible
[00:35:33] <peipst> those are 2 custom made overlays for a product
[00:35:37] <tw2113> i wouldn't be surprised if they add a click check on the semi-transparent overlay that they add
[00:35:37] <peipst> cant just replace it with lightbox :D
[00:35:45] <tw2113> i meant to see how THEY do it
[00:35:49] <peipst> ah
[00:37:10] <dailylinux> peipst, wondering how i can change $('#shareWith').autocomplete({minLength: 2, source: function(search, response)  with something like  $('#shareWith').on({'keydown', source: function(e, search, response) {   if(e.keyCode== 13) { ..
[00:38:36] <peipst> you're mixing things up there, .on has nothing to do with .autocomplete
[00:38:53] <dailylinux> oh
[00:39:09] <peipst> .on just attaches an eventhandler, in your case a keydown. autocomplete is something entirely different :P
[00:40:52] <peipst> $('input').on('keydown', function(x) {   if (x.keyCode == 9) { /*tab got pressed inside input*/  }     });
[00:41:00] <dailylinux> i see,. I'm trying to get rid of autocomplete to be replace with entering text and then Enter
[00:43:19] <dracco> Hello. I have very odd problem with jQuery. I downloaded a slideshow library. It works in examples that came with package, but after I add it to my site it throws error about function slides not defined. Tried other libraries and some modifications, basically nothing I add to $.fn is defined later... Anybody has an idea about fixing it?
[00:44:02] <ravenzz> ?demo @ dracco
[00:44:03] <b-ot> dracco: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[00:45:05] <dailylinux> peipst, can i use '#sharewith 'instead of 'input'?
[00:45:15] <dailylinux> i.e css ID
[00:45:22] <peipst> of course, it takes an selector as parameter
[00:45:29] <dailylinux> cool :)
[00:45:51] <peipst> also stuff like div#content > input[type=radio]
[00:45:52] <peipst> is possible
[00:46:14] <ravenzz> or :radio
[00:46:21] <dracco> Site is on localhost, and I don't have a public IP, while it weights 200mb and uploading it could take a longer while. I'll try recreating this error on fiddle, but as I said it works in examples. Anyway lemme try :).
[00:47:47] <ravenzz> dracco eh but without having a look at your code is almost impossible for us to help
[00:48:18] <chrisbuchholz> How can i programmatically trigger and drag from one DOM element to another?
[00:48:23] <chrisbuchholz> a *
[00:48:31] <dracco> Yea I know :/. If it wont (or rather will) work on jsfiddle, I'll have no other choice than uploading it :/
[00:48:43] <dailylinux> peipst, ok
[00:48:45] <ravenzz> dailylinux if you have a bunch of that inputs consider event delegation btw (described into the on doc page)
[00:49:27] <dailylinux> ravenzz, ok, but the input is just text (username) and then enter, once at time
[00:51:42] <ravenzz> anyway you should add an event listener to the form, so when it is submitted you can run your logic
[00:52:16] <peipst> hey ravenzz do you have an idea on how to catch mouse clicks outside of div#x ? (closing an overlay by clicking somewhere else)
[00:58:09] <ravenzz> peipst $(document).on('click', function (e) { }); :?
[00:59:17] <peipst> isnt it a bit performance heavy to attach this to every click? even when overlay is hidden?
[00:59:58] <tw2113> i assume the overlays that lightboxes add have a dom element
[01:00:00] <ravenzz> probably
[01:00:14] <tw2113> attach a single click to that 1 elem
[01:00:32] <tw2113> make it show up even if it's completely transparent
[01:00:37] <ravenzz> you could bind every time you open it a new one
[01:00:37] <tw2113> 100% x 100%
[01:01:11] <ravenzz> like $overlay.on('show', function () { $(document).one('click', function () {}); });
[01:01:22] <dracco> Ok stupid me, I uploaded a pure html saved page instead of whole script :P. It is here: http://dracco.vot.pl/fargotex/fargotex.html
[01:02:33] <dracco> Open JS console after you enter the page and reload it, it shouts about slides not a function, while it is declared in slides00.js, that is included before slides usage
[01:02:46] <tw2113> man, i'm looking at a client site that i'm working on, and their pages load like 43wt3w252345235 js scripts it seems
[01:03:07] <tw2113> and the only ones i care about in any sense are jQuery related
[01:03:11] <tw2113> the rest are adds or social bs
[01:03:43] <peipst> haha
[01:04:10] <ravenzz> peipst actually if you have an overlay elememnt (you know the gray layer) you can attach an event handler to it...once
[01:04:22] <tw2113> ads*
[01:04:53] <ravenzz> I've got to fix some ie7 shit bbl
[01:05:08] <peipst> ravenzz, i have no gray layer :P you click on a link and a big div scrolls in from the right side, now if you click like beneath of it it should disappear
[01:05:24] <tw2113> we're saying CREATE a dom element layer
[01:05:28] <tw2113> that covers the whole page
[01:05:32] <tw2113> that you can bind to
[01:05:43] <tw2113> to close the big div that scrolls
[01:06:16] <peipst> and move its z-index under the div?
[01:06:26] <tw2113> yeah
[01:06:32] <peipst> ill try that brb ;D
[01:12:37] <peipst> tw2113, i got a problem with the gray overlay :/
[01:12:45] <peipst> it doesnt fit the page height
[01:13:01] <dracco> Ok my problem solved. I didn't notice that debugger was out of HTML tag and hence all the problems occur. Thanks for help anyway :).
[01:13:13] <dracco> Have a nice day everyone!
[01:13:26] <peipst> i've set it to 100% but when i show(); it and scroll a bit down it ends :/
[01:13:46] <tw2113> stuff to work out
[01:14:05] <peipst> AH! position: fixed; ftw!
[01:18:03] <peipst> tw2113, it works perfect thanks!
[01:26:46] <Misan> everything is different now O_O
[01:26:51] <didiergm> jqm - confused about dialogs: I have a large html page with several divs acting like pages (data-role="page").  the navigation is done via $.mobile.changePage. It works fine. I need to add two divs with a data-role="dialog"  and    I  am confused as where to put them. Inside of a page then they do not work when opened via changePage unless the page they belong to is active, outside of a page then when navigating from one page to the other
[01:26:51] <didiergm> , they are shown as a flash of unstyled content.  I must be missing something any pointer would help
[01:50:27] <Krambiorix> hi guys, $('#myselect').change(function() { alert('test');});   doesn't work (no alert) , can someone help?
[01:53:47] <motaka2> jquery how to change just the opacity of parent element ?
[01:54:33] <peipst> .parent().css('opacity', '0.5');  motaka2
[01:55:03] <motaka2> peipst: What about using fadeto ?
[01:55:09] <peipst> Krambiorix, is #myselect being generated dynamically? also consider using .on()
[01:55:15] <peipst> as you wish motaka2
[01:55:17] <Krambiorix> peipst, no, plain html
[01:56:19] <motaka2> peipst: This one doesnt work
[01:56:20] <motaka2> $('.window-mask-frame').parent.fadeTo("slow", 0.3);
[01:56:25] <Krambiorix> peipst, $('#reminder').on('change',function() { .... doesn't work either
[01:56:26] <peipst> k wait a sec Krambiorix
[01:56:33] <Krambiorix> peipst, sure
[01:56:53] <peipst> motaka2, u're missing curly braces of parent().fade...
[01:56:54] <motaka2> peipst: it changed the position of my dialog from ceter to top left
[01:58:02] <motaka2> peipst: again it changed the opacity of the mask and the modal together
[01:58:04] <motaka2> $('.window-mask-frame').parent().fadeTo("slow", 0.3);
[01:58:22] <peipst> Krambiorix, http://jsfiddle.net/t92hQ/
[01:58:38] <peipst> Krambiorix, something in your environment must be different, can you extract your stuff into a jsfiddle?
[01:59:17] <peipst> motaka2, are you sure .parent() leads to the correct dom element?
[01:59:37] <motaka2> peipst: lemme check with console.log
[02:00:30] <Krambiorix> peipst, hmmm, ok i'll check it
[02:00:48] <motaka2> peipst: yes - to an element which it's class is window-mask
[02:01:50] <peipst> motaka2, is it possible to strip your code out to a jsfiddle?
[02:02:13] <motaka2> peipst: wait ....
[02:04:26] <motaka2> peipst: here is somecode
[02:04:28] <motaka2> http://jsfiddle.net/D2RcR/
[02:04:33] <motaka2> thanks
[02:05:53] <peipst> motaka2, i guess youre running into a css-bug not an js/jq bug
[02:06:12] <peipst> when you put opacity on a div, every child will get that opacity as well
[02:06:16] <motaka2> peipst: I pasted the CSS too
[02:06:45] <peipst> yes and putting opacity on .window-mask will put opacity on the whole modal window
[02:09:07] <motaka2> peipst: So what should I do ?
[02:09:24] <peipst> do you want to put opacity on the rest of the screen to highlight the popup?
[02:09:32] <peipst> or what should have opacity and what not?
[02:09:33] <motaka2> yes
[02:10:03] <peipst> just a sec
[02:10:10] <motaka2> I just want window-mask to have opacity
[02:11:31] <peipst> put this as a sibling of .window-mask
[02:11:32] <peipst> <div id="overlay" style="background-color: black; opacity: 0.20; height: 100%; width: 100%; position: fixed; top: 0px; display:none; z-index: 5;"></div>
[02:11:57] <peipst> and put this line in the part where you show your modal window: $('#overlay').show();
[02:12:08] <topriddy> i am looking what js would be needed to use jquery validation.
[02:12:12] <alexises> hi
[02:12:21] <topriddy> hello
[02:12:55] <alexises> I would like to make tooltip on th element
[02:13:12] <brantje`afk> $('th').tooltip
[02:13:57] <alexises> brantje`afk: unforntunently the title option is not avalable on th balise
[02:14:39] <peipst> your tooltip plugin must have some option to override this
[02:14:51] <peipst> like $('th').tooltip({text: 'my text'});
[02:15:07] <peipst> check the documentation of your plugin
[02:15:38] <alexises> hum sheet !, I need to do this on large amount of th :(
[02:15:58] <peipst> put the content of it in another element
[02:15:59] <peipst> like
[02:16:18] <peipst> <th data-tooltip="my text">
[02:16:44] <motaka2> peipst: html5 ?
[02:16:48] <alexises> hum, the data-tooltip is not html valid
[02:17:05] <alexises> it's not cause problem on ie ?
[02:17:08] <peipst> $('th').each(function(k,v) { $(this).tooltip({text: $(this).data('tooltip')});  });
[02:17:22] <peipst> it should'nt, try it
[02:17:33] <alexises> ok ;) I'll try
[02:18:07] <motaka2> peipst: since my english is not good I can't understand your answer
[02:22:03] <topriddy> i am looking what js would be needed to use jquery validation.
[02:24:51] <olly_c> acp99bodc
[02:30:08] <motaka2> should I use jquery UI , or it is better to creat what I need?
[02:31:11] <Ov3rTaf> hi
[02:31:26] <seutje> anyone know an easier way to get chosen multiselect behavior combined with regular text-input, sorta like e-mail to field, without hacking chosen too much?
[02:34:36] <hooloovoo> Ov3rTaf: hi!
[02:35:22] <alexises> peipst: hum, it's look like to don't make anything
[02:35:39] <alexises> I have add a tooltip attribute on my th with a text
[02:35:55] <alexises> Firebug don't show any error
[02:35:57] <basiclaser> hey guys, do you ever lose interest in programming for a couple days? I woke up and don't feel any dryve to learn today
[02:36:30] <djQuery> hey guys
[02:36:55] <kelye> basiclaser: every day, every day :)
[02:37:02] <djQuery> basiclaser, so time to make something instead of learning something
[02:37:34] <djQuery> make something u want instead of something ur paid
[02:37:45] <basiclaser> think ill just watch some google lectures :P
[02:38:21] <djQuery> basiclaser, get stuck everytime I open ted talks
[02:39:23] <basiclaser> are there any good jquery mobile video series?
[02:42:13] <ravenzz> jquery mobile is not good itself imho :p
[02:43:16] <djQuery> ravenzz, what do you suggest for mobile dev then
[02:44:02] <ravenzz> you can do alot in css these days and just use feature specific scripts
[02:45:01] <ravenzz> I used jquery mobile once, and I ended up having a super heavy website
[02:45:31] <Lebowski> Is this the correct way to select an input called search_oc ? var fkey = jQuery('#search').find('input[name=search_oc]').first();
[02:47:17] <djQuery> Lebowski, does the input have an id as well?
[02:47:28] <djQuery> Lebowski, looks like that should work
[02:47:30] <Lebowski> no
[02:47:44] <Lebowski> hmm damn its something else then :/
[02:47:45] <Eviltwin> That is how you select an <input> named "search_oc", yes
[02:47:54] <kelye> Lebowski: depends on what you're trying to do after
[02:48:01] <Eviltwin> Within an element with id "search"
[02:48:11] <Lebowski> im just trying to get someone elses script working (its and ajax search extension)
[02:48:14] <kelye> we need the html also
[02:48:20] <djQuery> Lebowski, I typicaly use get(0) rather than first
[02:48:44] <Lebowski> http://tinyurl.com/ah8ef2p any idea why livesearch.js is not working ?
[02:50:39] <djQuery> Lebowski, well limit your search down
[02:51:02] <djQuery> $('#search') returned null for me
[02:51:36] <Lebowski> did you just type that in console ?
[02:51:46] <Eviltwin> Then you don't have jQuery loaded properly
[02:51:48] <kelye> Lebowski: you have 2 elements with id search_oc
[02:51:49] <djQuery> Lebowski, was that supposed to be $('#search_oc')
[02:51:52] <djQuery> yes i did
[02:52:02] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ Lebowski
[02:52:06] <Lebowski> kelye, yeah thats why i tried to specify input
[02:52:11] <Eviltwin> Where is that damn bot...
[02:52:17] <Eviltwin> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[02:52:20] <Eviltwin> Lebowski: ^
[02:52:21] <Eviltwin> Read that
[02:52:27] <Lebowski> thanks
[02:52:29] <Lebowski> will take a look
[02:52:38] <djQuery> Lebowski, if you have more than one it will allways return the first one
[02:52:39] <kelye> specify another Id for the input and use that directly
[02:52:48] <djQuery> the others will allways be ignored
[02:52:55] <Lebowski> dj, i only really want it to work on the first input with that name
[02:53:41] <djQuery> then just do $('input[name=search_oc]')
[02:54:17] <Lebowski> hmm is the #search finding elements inside something with the id #search ?
[02:54:23] <kelye> ^ should work also if you don't want to modify html
[02:54:44] <djQuery> hmmm not finding it that way either
[02:55:22] <kelye> Lebowski: you don't have a #search element
[02:55:30] <kelye> nothing in that page has id search
[02:55:35] <Lebowski> ah i understand now
[02:55:44] <kelye> the search div is search_oc
[02:55:55] <Lebowski> thanks
[02:56:01] <djQuery> Lebowski, you got something else going on. $('input') returns a null
[02:56:21] <djQuery> ok just $ is broke ass
[02:56:24] <Lebowski> maybe i will remove input then if #search_oc is selecting the outside div
[02:56:33] <djQuery> jQuery('input') works
[02:56:46] <kelye> djQuery: he is loading A LOT of js
[02:56:49] <kelye> mootols also
[02:56:56] <kelye> so $ might not be jq
[02:57:46] <djQuery> this returns 2 jQuery('input[name="search_oc"]')
[02:58:25] <djQuery> jQuery('input[name="search_oc"]').first()  returns 1   but fix your ids
[02:59:42] <Lebowski> i think id is fixed now
[03:00:53] <djQuery> Lebowski, have you used the audit feature of chrome yet?
[03:01:02] <Lebowski> no
[03:01:24] <djQuery> take a look at it
[03:01:35] <djQuery> 2425 unused css rules
[03:02:15] <Lebowski> ah
[03:02:20] <djQuery> This page makes 31 parallelizable requests to 203.170.85.2. Increase download parallelization by distributing the following requests across multiple hostnames.
[03:02:22] <Lebowski> yeah cms tend to suck like that
[03:02:32] <Lebowski> i havent optimised anything yet
[03:02:46] <djQuery> how many versions of jquery are u loading
[03:02:48] <Lebowski> will get gzip minify cache etc going later
[03:02:55] <Lebowski> probably 2
[03:03:11] <peipst> CHROME I HATE YOUUUUUUUUU
[03:03:14] <peipst> sry
[03:03:32] <Lebowski> hmm well it wasnt just the ids
[03:03:41] <Lebowski> going back to reading slides
[03:03:57] <djQuery> lol 28 different css files
[03:04:56] <seba4> someone knows why i have a problem with this code... https://gist.github.com/seba4/5029146
[03:05:13] <seba4> i want to check if  li has  ul underneath.
[03:05:31] <seba4> i get the number if i go over with a mouse from top .. but 0 if i am going from other sides..
[03:06:40] <kelye> try $(izbran.target).closest('li').has("ul")
[03:07:32] <Lebowski> well jQuery('#search_oc').find('[name=search_oc]').first(); definately finds the search box
[03:07:53] <djQuery> Lebowski, cool
[03:08:01] <Lebowski> but it still doesnt work lol
[03:08:14] <Lebowski> i think i will give up and try again tommorow
[03:08:31] <djQuery> seba4, or do $("#menuBox .result").text($(izbran.target).children("ul").length);  if you want an actual count
[03:08:31] <Lebowski> thanks for all your help
[03:10:07] <seba4> thx kelye your works.. i just dont know why djquery solution doesnt..
[03:10:16] <seba4> when i go over from a top... i get 1
[03:10:27] <seba4> but when from sides... it is 0
[03:10:30] <seba4> on same button..
[03:10:43] <kelye> sometimes the target is not what you expect :)
[03:11:12] <djQuery> seba4, also check your comments
[03:11:35] <kelye> you'll have the same problem with something like <a href="#" data-id="123"><i class="delete"></i> Delete</a>
[03:11:43] <djQuery> if your going to be using $("#menuBox .result") a lot chache it
[03:12:15] <seba4> i did that just so i dont have to press ok on allert:)
[03:12:26] <seba4> so it is live.. showing me values...
[03:12:28] <djQuery> $menuBoxResult.text($(izbran.target).closest('li').children("ul").length);
[03:12:42] <seba4> but this code worked yea..
[03:12:57] <kelye> if you try to do something like $('a').on('click', function(ev) { $(ev.target).data('id') } you might have <i>as target ..
[03:13:11] <kelye> so better just always use closest
[03:13:21] <seba4> oh ok thx..
[03:26:45] <Daniel15> Does anyone know how jQuery patches the submit event so it bubbles and can be used with delegation in old IE?
[03:26:51] <Daniel15> I want to do the same thing with 'pure' JS
[03:27:54] <djQuery> Daniel15, grab the non minimized version
[03:28:14] <djQuery> Daniel15, set it up to capture the submit
[03:28:23] <djQuery> Daniel15, set a breakpoint
[03:28:43] <djQuery> sit back and enjoy learning
[03:29:31] <Daniel15> Hmm yeah, good idea, thanks. :)
[03:30:04] <djQuery> good luck
[03:33:23] <djQuery> its 5:30 am and I haven't written a line of code all nite
[03:47:56] <amirite> shutup your face
[04:18:10] <djQuery> so any type of button in an html5 form will cause validation to occur?
[04:21:31] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/uruvuy/1/edit
[04:22:08] <basiclaser> hey guys if you want to set a var time to the value of a slider , is it something like this? var time = input(slider('value'));
[04:24:32] <basiclaser> I'm really struggling to stick to one source for learning html5/jquery, nothing is right fit. I think its just a matter of time ill probably get through it all
[04:25:03] <Eviltwin> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[04:25:30] <basiclaser> i already read the second link :P
[04:25:37] <basiclaser> thanks though ill read the other
[04:26:50] <Eviltwin> I don't know where you could've gotten var time = input(slider('value')) from then...
[04:27:28] <basiclaser> not good at remembering syntax, I've only been studying a couple days
[04:27:55] <basiclaser> the format for writing methods etc isn't very natural for me atm
[04:27:55] <Eviltwin> Well that's not even close to right
[04:27:59] <Eviltwin> I suggest rereading
[04:28:18] <Eviltwin> What programming langauges have you done before?
[04:29:41] <basiclaser> none, i studying sql in uni for 1 month but have learning problems
[04:29:47] <basiclaser> i can make basic html css stuff though
[04:29:56] <motaka2> the scroll event doesnt invoke ceteralize in this code:  http://jsfiddle.net/xvcUP/
[04:30:00] <motaka2> why is that ?
[04:30:11] <Eviltwin> Well I can tell you that JavaScript is probably not a good first language
[04:30:20] <Eviltwin> And jQuery (without having learned JavaScript first) is an even worse choice
[04:30:39] <basiclaser> all i want to use is html css jquery though to make basic apps :<
[04:30:48] <basiclaser> what would you suggest>?
[04:31:42] <Eviltwin> I would suggest learning something else first (like Python) then swinging back to web stuff
[04:32:34] <basiclaser> gah .. i really wanted to make something for firefoxOS, i was really psyched
[04:36:41] <mboro> has anyone else experienced $.when() resolve before all ajax requests have completed?
[04:37:20] <Eviltwin> No
[04:38:03] <mboro> I'm doing five ajax requests that fetches a Backbone.Collection. randomly, the number of models in one of the collections is 0
[04:38:53] <mboro> looks like I was derping, nevermind
[04:39:01] <mboro> thx :P
[04:47:21] <seba4> hi there one question... I got <li> .... so when i go over background changes...  but there is a problem because if i move over many <li> background just keeps repeating and changes opacity. I want it to see play only if it is not already set to transparent..
[04:48:41] <untaken> I am trying to change the value of a combo box, when I do jQuery('#sort_by').val("sold_date") , it changes the value, so if I do jQuery('#sort_by').val() it returns "sold_date", but does not update the combo on the pagr. Any ideas?
[04:52:38] <fonko> is it possible to get attributes from a set of <a > inside a specific div?
[04:54:27] <kaele> I can do $('link') to get any link element in a document, but what if I want to get a specific type, like rel='icon'?
[04:54:43] <kaele> $('link[rel="icon"]') ?
[04:54:55] <nFFF> ?tias
[04:54:55] <b-ot> nFFF: Try It And See
[04:57:10] <Parsi> why $("#foo").width returns full width in ie7 of screen? while it's 470px in ie8?
[05:01:12] <Parsi> my div has not 'width' property in css
[05:02:13] <sasori> hi , how to prevent the page reload after a fancybox has closed ?
[05:18:06] <alexises> grumf !
[05:18:34] <alexises> I don't be able to use the tooltip widget
[05:18:49] <alexises> and I don't know why
[05:21:05] <djQuery> alexises, well thats not gonna help us help up

[05:22:10] <hooloovoo> :(
[05:22:30] <djQuery> hooloovoo, I musta killed it
[05:22:34] <hooloovoo> ya

[05:22:57] <b-ot> hooloovoo: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:22:59] <hooloovoo> nope
[05:23:26] <djQuery> alexises, see `demo
[05:23:48] <hooloovoo> where's the changelog for b-ot? =(
[05:30:52] <kelye> seba4: you have to check your selectors
[05:31:38] <kelye> and/or set a data- variable on each li and check that before every bg change
[05:32:16] <alexises> http://jsfiddle.net/5cyQ4/7/
[05:32:26] <alexises> no tooltip show :(
[05:32:29] <kelye> untaken: more details pls
[05:33:01] <alexises> (this webside is realy usefull ;) )
[05:33:23] <kelye> fonko: $('#id-of-div a').each(function (i, el) { $(el). attr ...})
[05:35:42] <djQuery> frigin cat walked on my keyboard when I got up to go to the BR and been chasing down the errors for an hour now
[05:36:54] <kelye> :))))
[05:36:59] <hagar_> hello, is there any way to make pop unders working in chrome? tested many solutions, don't work in chrome 24,25
[05:37:03] <kelye> diff ?
[05:38:01] <alexises> no idea for my case ?
[05:39:49] <kelye> looking now
[05:45:25] <kelye> alexises: the very fast solution is to set title="" on your table headers
[05:45:36] <kelye> and then just $('th').tooltip()
[05:45:44] <djQuery> alexises, this should do it http://jsbin.com/ejikiw/1/edit
[05:46:08] <djQuery> don't understand why thats not working
[05:49:36] <alexises> realy strange, bur it's work, i don't need enought
[05:50:16] <djQuery> alexises, here try this one http://jsbin.com/ejikiw/2/edit
[05:50:41] <djQuery> alexises, evidently for content to work you have to give it items as well
[05:51:01] <djQuery> and actualy attach the tool tip to the parent item
[05:53:23] <fALSO> Hi there
[05:53:47] <fALSO> CAn anyone explain me how to animate this
[05:53:48] <fALSO> $(data).insertAfter(elemento).fadeIn("slow");
[05:53:59] <kelye> far better solution djQuery  :)
[05:54:01] <fALSO> this isnt "animating" anything
[05:54:10] <fALSO> the element appears instantly
[05:54:22] <alexises> djQuery: realy thinks, I'm realy bad in jquery :D
[05:54:54] <alexises> when I need to write some javascript stuff, I always need more than 1/2 days
[05:55:10] <alexises> (even I only need to write 4 line :D)
[05:55:16] <djQuery> alexises, http://jsbin.com/ejikiw/3/edit
[05:55:16] <kelye> fALSO: unless your data has a wrapper div , I don't see how
[05:55:24] <fALSO> i found out
[05:55:27] <fALSO> $(data).fadeIn("slow").insertAfter(elemento);
[05:55:29] <fALSO> like this it works
[05:55:47] <kelye> good
[05:56:40] <djQuery> fALSO, woulda thought either woulda worked
[05:57:31] <fALSO> nah... its not working CORRECTLY
[05:57:37] <seba4> kelye ... this is the code i got right now..
[05:57:37] <seba4> https://gist.github.com/seba4/5029146#file-clean-js-L9
[05:57:52] <fALSO> still need to figureout whats wrng
[05:58:04] <seba4> kinda works... it is just a problem that ... when css dropdown opens and i go over it... background changes to full color
[05:58:06] <seba4> https://gist.github.com/seba4/5029146#file-clean-js-L9
[05:58:35] <seba4> first <ul><li> is the same for the code like <ul><li><ul>li>
[05:58:59] <djQuery> seba4, what are you trying to do whith this by the way?
[05:59:23] <djQuery> seba4, can you put together a demo
[05:59:34] <seba4> hm what is the page? fiddle?
[05:59:36] <seba4> will try
[05:59:50] <djQuery> jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net
[05:59:59] <kelye> better do a fiddle, it is unclear
[06:00:20] <kelye> what if the mouse leaves in the middle of the showing animation?
[06:00:25] <kelye> do you just stop it ?
[06:00:56] <mkoks> hey, I can get value of selected option just by getting the value of whole select, but If I have custom attribute on option elements I cannot get it just like $(select).attr("customattr").. any suggestions?
[06:02:37] <djQuery> mkoks, $('#selectID option:selected').attr('attributename')
[06:02:58] <djQuery> mkoks, unless your being nice and using a data-   attribute
[06:03:12] <djQuery> mkoks, $('#selectID option:selected').data('dataname')
[06:03:46] <djQuery> mkoks, unless its a multi select then you need to do an each and
[06:03:53] <mkoks> thanks djQuery, this works
[06:04:11] <stabb> Stupid multi
[06:04:16] <mkoks> I cannot use data attr because this page is meant to work on non html5 browsers too
[06:04:53] <stabb> Well… you can
[06:05:02] <paulvd> how can i execute a function once the video finished in jwplayer
[06:05:14] <paulvd> i want to hide the video and show the slideshow instead in that place
[06:05:17] <djQuery> mkoks, var results = []  $('#selectID option:selected').each(function(){ results.push($(this).data('dataname'));});
[06:05:42] <mkoks> stabb isnt data-attribute html5 thing?
[06:05:48] <ravenzz> is slideDown/Up buggy in ie7?
[06:06:04] <djQuery> mkoks, so what it works in all browsers
[06:06:36] <djQuery> mkoks, you might as well do stuff in the new standard when it doesn't break the old
[06:06:43] <stabb> mkoks: getAttribute
[06:07:02] <stabb> valid or not
[06:07:13] <stabb> it works :)
[06:07:27] <mkoks> why is data-attr better? more clear?
[06:07:44] <mkoks> I mean for reading and avoiding conflicts and so on
[06:07:51] <stabb> its marginally faster
[06:08:02] <kelye> mkoks: yes, in fact that's that point of your custom attribute
[06:08:03] <djQuery> mkoks, because <span mycustomattribute="NOT VALID IN ANY BROWSER">Thats why</span>
[06:08:05] <juha_> also it's standard. "customattr" is not
[06:08:10] <stabb> http://jsperf.com/jquery-data-vs-attr/22
[06:08:10] <kelye> to pass some data
[06:08:58] <djQuery> not to say custom attributes don't work just not valid
[06:09:06] <mkoks> ok, thanks for advice guys
[06:09:20] <stabb> not valid html = who cares (mostly)
[06:09:28] <djQuery> lol
[06:10:13] <djQuery> what was that old way of binding IE5 forms to xml elements
[06:10:18] <stabb> Seriously, if you want valid anything, prepare to be unemployed
[06:10:31] <djQuery> there was a special attribute for the form and another one for the inputs
[06:10:38] <kelye> I'm employed and earning quite a lot
[06:10:39] <stabb> except javascript ^__^
[06:10:47] <kelye> and I do valid things
[06:11:17] <kelye> there's a difference between 'not doing valid' and not knowing what's valid
[06:11:31] <stabb> That is correct
[06:11:49] <kelye> *maybe* sometime you need to skip some things or do hacks
[06:11:58] <kelye> but that's a rare case
[06:12:02] <djQuery> stabb, yes you can spend all week chasing the ever changing valid tail
[06:12:12] <stabb> But in the case of reading attributes from markup, it's silly.
[06:12:37] <kelye> maybe, but think about semantics
[06:12:47] <stabb> valid ordering of markup is the most important
[06:13:02] <kelye> having a solid and correct markup is like speaking correctly
[06:13:21] <kelye> you don't have to explain to a person 5 times what you're trying to do, the markup will speak for you
[06:13:42] <kelye> data-some-stuff ? --that means you're storing some data related to that element
[06:13:49] <kelye> somestuff="asa" .. yea, some stuff..
[06:14:29] <kelye> of course, it's just debate, but I do find clear code to be helpful
[06:14:38] <stabb> data-update="saabs" data-slide-down="green"
[06:14:44] <seba4> ok ... hope this improves understanding what i am trying to do..
[06:14:45] <seba4> http://fiddle.jshell.net/seba4/HbHWJ/27/
[06:15:31] <kelye> whoha
[06:15:57] <kelye> after moving my mouse around.. 5 mins later the animations still work :))
[06:16:13] <seba4> :)
[06:16:20] <stabb> I know whats working, my LSD
[06:16:21] <martisj> Morning all
[06:16:21] <djQuery> seba4, your still doing this $(this).closest("li").has("ul").length > 0
[06:16:28] <djQuery> seba4, when you need to do this
[06:16:29] <martisj> stabb: hahaha
[06:16:36] <djQuery> $(this).closest("li").children("ul").length > 0
[06:16:39] <djQuery> or this
[06:16:45] <djQuery> $(this).closest("li").has("ul") > 0
[06:16:47] <martisj> has anybody used slidesjs ? from http://slidesjs.com/
[06:17:00] <djQuery> seba4, has returns a true false
[06:17:10] <seba4> oh
[06:17:29] <kelye> martisj: I just tried this weekend
[06:17:37] <stabb> what does izbran even mean
[06:17:42] <kelye> the width and height config never worked
[06:17:50] <kelye> so I just used nivo slider
[06:18:38] <seba4> izbran - selected
[06:19:39] <martisj> kelye: aha, does nivo slider allow for dynamic loading of slides?
[06:20:25] <alphonse23> can anyone help troubleshoot a simple jquery keypress problem?
[06:20:37] <djQuery> seba4, evidently I was wrong about has.
[06:21:05] <kelye> not very sure, http://dev7studios.com/nivo-slider/#/documentation
[06:21:18] <martisj> kelye: do you have to pay for it though?
[06:21:26] <kelye> no, there is a free version
[06:21:47] <kelye> The Nivo Slider jQuery plugin is open source and released under the MIT license.
[06:22:20] <martisj> kelye: aha thanks :)
[06:22:25] <pressureman> i've just been reading/searching a bit about the deprecation plan for jqXHR.success(), .error() and .complete() - is there a timeframe for when these will be removed?
[06:22:42] <seba4> djQuery, i changed it now to closest children length... kinda works.. problem is that when i go to opened submenu ... background turn opacity on agian ..
[06:23:00] <seba4> i mean opacity is then 1.0 where it should still be 0.2
[06:23:39] <alphonse23> can anyone tell me why var entry_el = $('#entry
[06:24:13] <alphonse23> ')); var mes = entry_el.attr('value'); returns null. entry is an input tag
[06:25:04] <pressureman> why not just used $('#entry').val() ?
[06:26:48] <mieszkos> hi, can someone tell me how to write working jquery loader in jquery on anroid (2.x)
[06:26:57] <mieszkos> android*
[06:27:12] <djQuery> mieszkos, load what?
[06:27:18] <mieszkos> coz when im doin ajax request it doesnt show on phone
[06:27:20] <xec-> alphonse23: what pressureman said. also, .attr() is for retrieving attributes. if you want a property (such as the dynamically updated value of an input field), use .prop()
[06:27:33] <alphonse23> ok, that worked!
[06:27:36] <alphonse23> thanks
[06:27:39] <mieszkos> loader i mean something like progress bar (just image showin that data is loading)
[06:27:59] <alphonse23> thanks both pressureman and xec
[06:28:10] <seba4> djQuery, u meybe know how i could solve that so background wont be changed after mouseover submenu ..
[06:28:13] <mieszkos> when ajax request is in action.. on phone i dont see this loader, but on computer i see.
[06:28:52] <djQuery> seba4, when I did stuff like this before I dropped to the native setTimout
[06:29:05] <seba4> hm
[06:29:07] <seba4> ?
[06:29:11] <djQuery> seba4, then on mouse over of the sub item I canceled the timeout of the parent
[06:29:40] <seba4> ok ..
[06:29:45] <seba4> will try that
[06:29:52] <djQuery> seba4, don't know if you can do that with the delay
[06:29:59] <mieszkos> http://pastebin.com/DRnLFLHF  need here that when ajax is in action -> show loading image... im doing ajaxStart and it works on computer, but  on android it doesnt show.
[06:30:40] <djQuery> seba4, wait
[06:31:44] <mieszkos> any one know : - < ?
[06:32:09] <seba4> djQuery, am waiting:P
[06:32:47] <slainer68> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15069165/dont-manage-to-make-cross-domain-requests-even-with-good-headers > i don't manage to do cross domain requests :(. if you can help, thank you.
[06:34:30] <mieszkos> djQuery do u know how to fix it?
[06:35:09] <stabb> document.domain has to be set the same
[06:36:12] <stabb> even Facebook fucks up this one
[06:37:19] <Mento> I got a few anchors and I want to add an href to each of them with jQuery like: #tab1 - #tab2 - #tab3 etc. how can I automate this? http://jsfiddle.net/rNvjS/
[06:37:35] <djQuery> seba4, http://fiddle.jshell.net/HbHWJ/37/      $.contains to the rescue
[06:39:07] <stabb> Mento: First you select their parent, then for each of them $(this) you can .attr('href', value)
[06:39:17] <djQuery> seba4, well its closer
[06:39:40] <seba4> i dont get... any opacity on red background..
[06:39:45] <stabb> Mento: .each
[06:39:52] <martisj> what is all this business about documentFragments?
[06:39:57] <martisj> when should i be using it?
[06:40:25] <seba4> oh because of .closest("li").children("ul").length > 0 will try sec
[06:41:35] <djQuery> seba4, check the changes in the mouseleave
[06:41:39] <stabb> martisj: i think chrome is pushing this natively
[06:41:53] <martisj> which is more performant: storing an element in a var, or making a documentFragment and attaching it to the dom for use later? the element would be used in a click event handler.
[06:42:02] <strict9> Morning. I have this relatively simple Jquery to fire off a post request for a form on submit, so that I can popup a modal window. It works fine in FF and Chrome but in IE the form never gets posted. Any ideas? http://jsbin.com/eroxak/1/edit
[06:42:24] <stabb> martisj: you can use localStorage
[06:42:29] <Mento> stabb: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/rNvjS/1/ - not sure how to make the counting, any suggestions?
[06:43:27] <stabb> Mento: You don't need the # - pretend you're just writing id="tab". But you know id's are mean't to be unique as possible
[06:44:10] <martisj> stabb: localStorage you say.
[06:44:19] <stabb> Mento: You can also $('#tabs a').attr('href', somethingunique);
[06:46:01] <jlebrech> jquery-autocomplete has pretty anoying default behaviour, it assumes your ajax returns 'name' and 'value', but no should have options to 'map' functions. and also when you select a result it outputs the 'value' to the input box rather than the name and inserting the 'value' into another input box.
[06:46:57] <stabb> strict9: why us jquery form? you can use serialize() in $.ajax
[06:47:06] <seba4> i dont know what this does contains... looked like it checks ... something..
[06:47:27] <stabb> strict9: wrong window, similar question, sorry
[06:47:56] <seba4> and noticed that it doesnt use opacity... no for mouseenter and leave..
[06:49:22] <stabb> seba4: what are you trying to do again?
[06:49:37] <Mento> stabb - well i added some more of my code, just to give you an idea what im trying to achieve: http://jsfiddle.net/rNvjS/3/ - this works fine.. but the problem is when i push this to my live website - it adds the full URL to the href="#tab1". It becomes href="/mypage/subpage/#tab1" instead which breaks my JS. So i try to set the href dynamically with JS
[06:50:15] <seba4> this http://fiddle.jshell.net/seba4/HbHWJ/40/
[06:50:29] <seba4> djquery did something to the code.. but now even opacity didnt work..
[06:50:51] <stabb> mento: improve structure. #tabs should contain the ul>li and the div#id
[06:50:52] <seba4> what i am trying to do in this code is that when u go over the submenu box the opacity wont change..
[06:51:40] <seba4> opacity should be 0.2 when on first <ul><li> that has submenu  or when u are on submenu ..
[06:52:42] <stabb> mento: this is how the click event goes. Remove all active classes. Add a class to this element. Get the href as a string, Fade in that $(string)
[06:52:54] <seba4> So when u go over Uporabniki ... red gets lighter and when u go to that opened box. ... opacity should be the same... 0.2
[06:53:48] <stabb> Mento: on the first line, you are saying they are clicking on the active tab (incorrect)
[06:54:26] <Mento> stabb: i see, i missed that when copying my html
[06:55:04] <Mento> uhh well im confused now xD
[06:55:17] <Mento> i do set the first li a to active with jQuery
[06:57:39] <stabb> btw, return false = fail
[06:58:45] <stabb> function(e) {e.preventDefault()}
[07:02:53] <djQuery> seba4, sorry need to get back to my own code
[07:03:00] <Mento> stabb - I got it working now, thanks for pushing me in the right direction
[07:03:25] <derik> how i make when i press edit button to get value from description cell http://jsfiddle.net/DS3fa/
[07:04:38] <mieszkos> so any one know how to write working image-loader to android (2.x) in jquery? when ajax is in action then show image, when its done hide it. i wrote with ajaxStart but it doenst show on android, on PC is ok
[07:06:58] <djQuery> derik, did you give it a try at all? http://jsfiddle.net/DS3fa/1/
[07:08:02] <derik> djQuery this are a simplist table , in my real table i have many input on row
[07:08:26] <kristofers> Hey i've decided to go with relational database model, but i'm still trying to figure out the best way to store lots of data in one field
[07:08:29] <kristofers> What do you suggest ?
[07:08:31] <kristofers> oops
[07:08:37] <derik> djQuery sorry, i will try this
[07:12:04] <djQuery> derik, http://jsfiddle.net/DS3fa/3/    you will need to give each of the inputs a name
[07:12:25] <djQuery> derik, my example only works on the 2nd row currently
[07:14:05] <mieszkos> well not one can help : (
[07:14:27] <djQuery> derik, but you may want to take a look at .serialize
[07:14:56] <derik> djQuery thanks for suggest but i think i make id for evrey input and will be much easy
[07:15:17] <djQuery> derik, then only 1 row can have them
[07:15:28] <djQuery> id must be unique for the page
[07:15:33] <derik> yes
[07:15:47] <derik> i will make description1, description2 ...
[07:16:30] <djQuery> that doesn't make sense when you could just have name="description"
[07:19:44] <hewitt_> hey guys.. im wondering how can i refresh my container div after the form is being submitted via ajax http://jsfiddle.net/HZjxr/
[07:19:49] <djQuery> derik, here ya go http://jsfiddle.net/DS3fa/4/   this is even easier but you have to use NAMES
[07:20:07] <derik> djQuery but that why isn`t good ? http://jsfiddle.net/DS3fa/5/ i see that is work , is your first version
[07:22:18] <derik> djQuery on same row will be only 1 class , the other input have diferit class
[07:22:38] <djQuery> derik, http://jsfiddle.net/DS3fa/6/
[07:23:01] <mieszkos> djQuery do u know how to fix my problem?
[07:23:45] <djQuery> derik, are you going to be submiting this to a server? are you going to manualy convert the items to a urlencoded string?
[07:24:01] <djQuery> derik, serialize does that for you
[07:24:09] <derik> ok, thanks djQuery
[07:24:31] <djQuery> derik, just limit the selector to only grab the inputs that you want
[07:26:15] <mieszkos> damn i cant find anything in interent about this
[07:26:17] <djQuery> hewitt_, get rid of the onsubmit   bind to the submit manualy in javascript.
[07:26:44] <atomiku> So does the data-role="navbar" have to be refreshed?
[07:26:54] <atomiku> I've got a class="ui-btn-active" on one of the lis… it doesn't look active!
[07:27:14] <hewitt_> mm
[07:27:16] <atomiku> And, refreshing the whole thing makes it active so I'm guessing its because the refresh() or live('refresh'); thing is being called on it
[07:27:35] <atomiku> Weirdness. Im guessing the ui-btn-class active class doesn't do anything itself
[07:27:59] <atomiku> which makes sense, I guess there has gotta be some jquery logic because it would need to apply a certain active class depending on the parent's data-theme=""
[07:29:04] <kelye> anyone worked with plupload?
[07:29:22] <didiergm> kelye yes but several months ago
[07:29:26] <djQuery> derik, something like this http://jsfiddle.net/HZjxr/1/
[07:29:43] <todance> Hi. I want to auto fade out (close) an alert with boostrap
[07:29:47] <todance> how can I do this?
[07:29:54] <todance> I'm so new to javascript at general.
[07:29:56] <kelye> do you remember a way to debug why the 'add' button does nothing ?
[07:30:07] <djQuery> atomiku, there are a couple other classes you need to add to it.
[07:30:09] <hewitt_> djQuery:  should i do $('#form').submit(function(event){ instead?
[07:30:19] <atomiku> djQuery: well okay, .trigger("create"); is what I need
[07:30:39] <atomiku> djQuery: but this is my major question: I would like to run some javascript once $.mobile.changePage has loaded the external php page
[07:30:42] <derik> thanks for help djQuery i will look now
[07:30:45] <djQuery> hewitt_, http://jsfiddle.net/HZjxr/1/
[07:31:08] <djQuery> derik, think I sent you wrong link ment that for hewitt_
[07:31:24] <derik> oh
[07:31:24] <derik> ok
[07:33:26] <hewitt_> djQuery:  sorry.. but how do i show the data after the submitting
[07:33:59] <djQuery> hewitt_, well what do you get back in the response?
[07:34:40] <hewitt_> djQuery:  should i do something like $('#container').html(response);  ?
[07:35:02] <djQuery> todance, so you want to do something with bootstrap but your in jquery?
[07:36:07] <thinkerweb> I tried to do this ajax for ui tabs, but nothing: .tabs("url", 0, "action.php").tabs("load", 0);
[07:36:15] <todance> djQuery: I guess I have to do it with jquery?
[07:36:20] <todance> :/
[07:36:25] <todance> I'm new to all this. sorry :(
[07:38:16] <djQuery> todance, well it does look like bootstrap uses jquery
[07:39:01] <todance> can you tell me how to do this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7676356/can-twitter-bootstrap-alerts-fade-in-as-well-as-out
[07:39:05] <todance> the first top answer
[07:39:13] <todance> where do I have to put the javascript code in?
[07:43:25] <thinkerweb> I have ui tabs setup and I am expecting to get some content from a php script but it doesn't work bynadeem.info/ui-testing/
[07:43:28] <atomiku> Yeah I have no idea why sometimes a navbar's active class isn't working
[07:43:33] <atomiku> When the page is loaded via ajax.
[07:44:18] <djQuery> atomiku, also once you get this working if they click the nav link for the page that they are allready on it will remove the classess
[07:44:22] <atomiku> omg
[07:44:22] <atomiku> ui-state-persist
[07:44:24] <atomiku> thats why
[07:44:49] <djQuery> atomiku, to work around this I just removed the nav link for the curent page on all pages
[07:45:04] <djQuery> atomiku, does it look selected now
[07:45:10] <atomiku> well see, this has fixed it for me: <li><a href="#event" data-icon="grid" class="ui-btn-active ui-state-persist">Scores</a></li>
[07:45:11] <atomiku> and yes
[07:45:13] <djQuery> atomiku, now click on it
[07:45:23] <atomiku> I didn't realize that it had some other behavior that was overriding the selected nacbar
[07:45:37] <atomiku> yeah see its all fine now
[07:46:06] <atomiku> djQuery: Actually perhaps you could share a small piece of advice me
[07:46:26] <atomiku> Now I get the feeling that the app im making has parts that are poorly coded, or are using some bad hacky methods
[07:46:31] <atomiku> but… forgetting about that....
[07:46:35] <djQuery> todance, http://jqfundamentals.com/
[07:47:05] <atomiku> djQuery: So the app starts with a menu. There are a list of events. You click an event, and it has a href of: #event?eventID=50
[07:47:36] <atomiku> djQuery: Bear with me.So i'm using the page params plugin to pass the ?eventID= param to the pagebeforeshow event for #event, right?
[07:48:04] <djQuery> k
[07:48:17] <atomiku> djQuery: #event loads, gets ?eventID, loads some stuff via AJAX, now you're looking at an event page. By this point I've stored eventID in a cookie
[07:48:30] <atomiku> so now within this event you have the nav bar.
[07:48:44] <atomiku> (think of event as a sport event, not a triggered event lol)
[07:49:00] <atomiku> So yeah the nav bar might want to link to #event_edit
[07:49:14] <atomiku> Really I would like to pass the current event ID to it though
[07:49:17] <atomiku> How might I do this?
[07:49:37] <atomiku> I mean, damn, should I just have a pagebeforeshow for #event_edit that tries to load the current ID from the cookie?
[07:49:56] <djQuery> atomiku, well if you stored it as a cookie allready then just pick up the cookie server side when you load the edit form
[07:50:08] <djQuery> the server side should have access to the cookies
[07:50:11] <atomiku> well actually the event_edit page was loaded in from the start
[07:50:22] <atomiku> oh you're right though actually, well played.
[07:50:42] <djQuery> heck set the cookie server side
[07:50:56] <atomiku> djQuery: uh..
[07:51:02] <atomiku> yep
[07:51:17] <djQuery> havent done that since aspx days but it was pretty easy
[07:51:18] <atomiku> Well alright then, just one minor question
[07:51:21] <darkfrog> is there any way in jQueryUI with Autocomplete to highlight the area typed so if I type "ala" it will that text bold in the results?
[07:51:28] <djQuery> don't know about doing it in php or whatever
[07:51:36] <Ansikt> Is there a method in jQuery similar to find + filter?  Where it will search all current elements AND their children?
[07:52:01] <djQuery> Ansikt, see .add
[07:52:17] <djQuery> but you will need to do 1 then the other
[07:52:46] <philhutchinson> If I change the src attribute of an image in jquery, is there a way i can get the original image (from the html) back?
[07:53:20] <atomiku> djQuery: $.mobile.changePage('includes/ajax/event_edit.php'); - Its causing some weird behavior with the URL bar. if the user refreshes the page then they are literally taken to includes/ajax/event_edit.php which isn't part of the app. What I kinda want is, if the user refreshes the page i'd like it to take them to #event (not event_edit.php)
[07:53:20] <philhutchinson> ie: if I have <img src="photo1.jpg" class="changeImage"> and then I use $(".changeImage").attr("src", "photo2.jpg"); is there a way I can get the "photo1.jpg" from the img tag back?
[07:53:23] <thinkerweb> the "url" option or method or event is depreciate?
[07:53:41] <djQuery> philhutchinson, only if you save it somewhere before you change it
[07:53:55] <philhutchinson> There's no way of getting the image back from the HTML SRC?
[07:54:40] <Ansikt> djQuery:  I'm not sure what you mean exactly....can I use add to pass in all the children of the current selector somehow, then filter the result?\
[07:54:57] <djQuery> var img  = $('imageslector'); img.data('orgurl', img.attr('scr')).attr('src', newurl);
[07:55:24] <djQuery> philhutchinson, ^^
[07:55:51] <djQuery> Ansikt, creat a var and set it to the parents using filter
[07:56:06] <djQuery> then use add to add the children using find
[07:57:09] <philhutchinson> thanks djQuery
[07:57:33] <djQuery> var x = null, parents = $('whatever').filter('filterstuffout'); parents.add($('whatever')).find('get the children'));
[07:57:51] <Ansikt> djQuery: Ah, I see!  There's also a version of the command that accepts a context.  I think this is what I want.  Thanks, man
[07:59:41] <djQuery> Ansikt, be sure to read the whole page
[08:01:34] <Wolfed> is there an equivalent to window.open() on jQuery?
[08:02:20] <yedimind> Wolfed, what would you expect it to do that window.open() wouldn't ?
[08:03:09] <Wolfed> Same as it does with everything else? Allow for some easier cross-browser support functions? :P
[08:03:33] <yedimind> what browser does not support window.open() ?
[08:03:41] <yedimind> what I'm getting at is, use window.open()
[08:04:17] <Wolfed> I didnt say window.open isnt support by most browsers, I said add certain functions in an easier way, as it does with everything else.
[08:04:29] <sasori> question: i am getting a response of success, and yet the alert("data"); doesn't work in my ajax  when it should have popped out a "success" word right? what could possibly be wrong?
[08:04:35] <Wolfed> Its not like jQuery does anything "new", it just makes things easier to do.
[08:04:53] <Wolfed> But alright, I guess it doesnt.
[08:04:58] <j105rob> How can I tell is $(this) is an input box or textarea? obviously "this" is a DOM node.. sry... I am a jQuery noob
[08:05:02] <NoiseEee> sasori: i give up!  (show code)
[08:06:26] <someprimetime> what's up ladies!
[08:06:31] <sasori> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/ExPPC/
[08:06:49] <someprimetime> i like how jsfiddle now initializes the awesome
[08:06:52] <someprimetime> wonder what it did before
[08:07:01] <tw2113> initialized the meh
[08:07:08] <yedimind> initializes the awesome ?
[08:07:10] <NoiseEee> sasori: seems like you're expecting a JSON response.  "success" is not valid JSON.
[08:07:12] <someprimetime> initialized the 2 servers it had running it
[08:07:24] <someprimetime> man all the cool people are on early
[08:07:28] <someprimetime> i need to get to work earlier from now on
[08:07:32] <sasori> NoiseEee: what should I do with the dataType ?
[08:07:41] <NoiseEee> sasori: are you actually returning JSON?
[08:07:47] <djQuery> j105rob,  http://jqfundamentals.com/
[08:08:01] <sasori> NoiseEee: nope... :D ...it's a message in backend ...word "success"
[08:08:08] <djQuery> if (this.type === 'whatever')
[08:08:21] <sasori> NoiseEee: should i change it to "text " instead of json ?
[08:08:24] <NoiseEee> sasori: yes
[08:08:30] <sasori> ok 1 sec..
[08:09:28] <j105rob> djQuery: thx... I am a noob to jQuery, not javascript.... guess I'll dig thru the API instead... thx
[08:10:05] <djQuery> j105rob, sorry we get a lot that are both
[08:10:10] <sasori> NoiseEee: holy fish paste..it worked...thank you :D
[08:10:20] <someprimetime> lol
[08:10:31] <NoiseEee> j105rob: "this" isnt' actually a DOM node; its a jquery object in your example.  check it out in console.
[08:10:31] <j105rob> djQuery: np....
[08:10:59] <j105rob> NoiseEee: wish it were that simple... I am working on a firefox add-on, so no console
[08:11:28] <someprimetime> you can't write to the console in firefox for add-ons?
[08:11:34] <someprimetime> can't you in chrome?
[08:11:36] <NoiseEee> well bring the code over to console or somewhere and inspect it; anyways yes you should probably read up on the jquery object etc
[08:11:51] <djQuery> j105rob, well just do the same type of thing in an html page so that yo ucan inspect it
[08:11:54] <j105rob> error console
[08:12:02] <j105rob> but that doesn't grok objs
[08:12:53] * djQuery grok old school 
[08:12:56] <djQuery> cool
[08:13:15] <djQuery> havent read that book in a while
[08:13:23] <j105rob> and I know "this" is a node because $('*').mouseenter(function() {//this is a dom node})
[08:13:44] <NoiseEee> j105rob: right, but $(this) isn't
[08:14:15] <j105rob> $('*').mouseenter(function() {$(this) //<--- is that})
[08:14:36] <sasori> question: how to reload the page within 5 seconds?.. i mean..reload it just once after 5 seconds
[08:14:50] <NoiseEee> $('*').mouseenter(function() {var jQueryObject = $(this);  var theNode = this;}) @ j105rob
[08:14:56] <todance> have a look at this please: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/232283
[08:14:57] <todance> does not work
[08:15:03] <todance> the message does not appear
[08:15:11] <j105rob> NoiseEee: AH! thx...
[08:16:14] <systemfault> Oh my... what an awful selector.
[08:16:26] <systemfault> Makes me want to cry.
[08:16:40] <carpii> :~(
[08:16:52] <carpii> its an event bomb
[08:17:00] <systemfault> If you have 1000 elements in your DOM... you just created 1000 event handlers.
[08:17:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, got this click handler: http://pastebin.com/SJJ4Np5M - problem is that the input element that it is referring to is added with jquery when a button is clicked... The form is not initially there... so the click handler is not working... how to attach a click handler to an element that is added on the fly to a page?
[08:18:29] <j105rob> @ carpii systemfault working proof of concept and very new to jQuery..... :)
[08:18:40] <todance> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/232283
[08:18:46] <todance> can anybody help please?
[08:19:19] <codegreen> in IE7 this bind creates the errors 'object does not support property or method bind' and could not complete operation due to error 80020101. is these a known iwwue with jquery and IE7 for this type of parameter binding? change: function( e, ui ) { this.update(e,ui) }.bind(this)
[08:19:36] <codegreen> *is there
[08:20:03] <systemfault> codegreen: .bind is ES5... so it won't work on IE7 and IE8
[08:20:13] <systemfault> codegreen: Unless you have a shim..
[08:20:45] <codegreen> ok thanks! saved me so much time.
[08:21:21] <systemfault> codegreen: You can use jQuery.proxy for similar effect.
[08:22:27] <codegreen> ok. i might code around it, but I will look at jquery proxy as you suggest
[08:24:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone can help me?
[08:25:24] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: What's wrong?
[08:25:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, got this click handler: http://pastebin.com/SJJ4Np5M - problem is that the input element that it is referring to is added with jquery when a button is clicked... The form is not initially there... so the click handler is not working... how to attach a click handler to an element that is added on the fly to a page?
[08:25:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I also tried on()
[08:25:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but it's not executing my code in the click handler :(
[08:25:51] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: You need to use the second form of .on
[08:26:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> second form?
[08:26:22] <systemfault> $(document).on('click', "input[id^=stepbutton_]", function() { alert('lol'); });
[08:26:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh
[08:26:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but why?
[08:26:34] <swz> hello, is there any way to make a working pop under under chrome? i tried many solutions with chrome 25, none of them work
[08:27:03] <systemfault> First form is: element.on(eventType, handler); second form is parentElementOrDocument.on(eventType, selector, handler);
[08:27:15] <church_> anyone know how to get cufon fonts to work with a jquery script?
[08:27:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Thx systemfault, but why is that the case? Why is the first form not ok?
[08:27:39] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: The first form attaches the handler to the element itself... and in your case, it doesn't exists at the moment you try to attach it.
[08:27:55] <church_> i can pull it in but it does not display , it seems like the font is rendering from the <text> in the svg
[08:27:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ic
[08:27:57] <b-ot> church_: No output.
[08:28:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it works, you're genius
[08:28:15] <church_> b-ot: none its empty
[08:28:22] <church_> well the display is empty
[08:28:33] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: The second form attaches the handler to parentElementOrDocument, not the element itself and it uses a DOM phenomenon called "bubbling" to trigger events, that technique is called event delegation
[08:28:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh yeah, read about that
[08:28:53] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: That's why it works for elements added in the future.
[08:28:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I assume it doesn't work in old browsers?
[08:29:03] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: Works fine in all browsers
[08:29:14] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: Except for the 'change' event on IE
[08:29:18] <systemfault> (Old IE)
[08:29:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[08:29:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> thx
[08:29:50] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: But for clicks and company... I encourage you to use it.
[08:30:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> always or just to dynamically added elements?
[08:30:50] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: I use it most of the time, it became my default way of handling events...
[08:31:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, can I ask something else regarding this?
[08:31:17] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: Sure
[08:31:31] <systemfault> church_: Nobody uses cufon anymore :(
[08:31:41] <church_> systemfault: why not?
[08:31:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> So the button i'm talking about exists in a dynamically added form... So when I press that button I handle the click event and do an ajax call
[08:31:46] <systemfault> church_: You'll have a hard time getting help on that..
[08:31:55] <systemfault> church_: Because we have better now
[08:32:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but will I be able to retrieve the data of a textbox inside that dynamically added field
[08:32:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[08:32:05] <church_> systemfault: whats better?
[08:32:14] <systemfault> church_: CSS3 @font-face
[08:32:49] <systemfault> church_: You can use the fontsquirrel generator to create a compatible font kit that will work in all browsers from a single font file
[08:33:21] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: Is that a submit button?
[08:33:33] <church_> systemfault: well i kinda disagree. I was using using @font face and it does not render the font nicely at all. some letters are a bit higher then others and its a tiny bit ( noticeable ) pixalated
[08:33:51] <systemfault> church_: Then use cufon...
[08:33:55] <church_> lol
[08:34:08] <church_> think i might use a different font
[08:34:40] <church_> ill check out the squirrel , thanks systemfault
[08:35:32] <basiclaser> hmm . . why isn't this hiding the <dd> (function() {
[08:35:33] <basiclaser> 	var dd = $('dd');
[08:35:34] <basiclaser> 	dd.addClass('hide');
[08:35:35] <basiclaser> 	 })();
[08:35:36] <basiclaser> </script>
[08:35:54] <basiclaser> i followed to tutorial perfectly but i get nothing
[08:36:05] <systemfault> church_: I've been using it for a long time, the only catch is to not use the browser's 'faux bold' on an embedded font.
[08:36:07] <Gho5t> did you define .hide
[08:36:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> systemfault: yeah
[08:36:18] <Gho5t> basiclaser: you sure it isn't saying dd.hide();
[08:36:42] <basiclaser> i tried that before, it didn't work either
[08:36:42] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: It will work fine, but an advice... don't use a click handler on the submit button
[08:36:44] <church_> cool im gunna give it a go now
[08:36:49] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: Use the submit event on the form.
[08:37:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hmm
[08:37:27] <systemfault> basiclaser: If you want to use a hide class... you need to define it:   .hide { display: none; }
[08:37:31] <Gho5t> basiclaser: it should be $(function(){ not (function()
[08:39:03] <basiclaser> ok thanks
[08:39:08] <basiclaser> still not working though :/
[08:39:39] <systemfault> basiclaser: Did youfollow Gho5t's advice
[08:39:47] <basiclaser> yep
[08:39:53] <slick-> hey guys
[08:39:55] <slick-> and gals
[08:40:08] <Gho5t> basiclaser: http://jsfiddle.net
[08:40:14] <slick-> I wanna do query animations (ie. a crane with a dangling chain etc)
[08:40:15] <Gho5t> paste your code there plz
[08:40:25] <slick-> should I use jquery spritley?
[08:40:39] <slick-> I've looked at jquery transit but it seems too basic
[08:41:02] <slick-> what other awesome plugins are there for animations? (that resemble flash animations)
[08:41:27] <basiclaser> http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/smntc/
[08:41:51] <systemfault> slick-: Most of the powerful animations tools are canvas/svg based
[08:42:08] <slick-> I see?
[08:42:14] <slick-> what about spritley it seems easy enough
[08:42:17] <slick-> I create the sprites
[08:42:20] <slick-> and it does the animations
[08:42:29] <Gho5t> basiclaser: runs fine once you add the jquery library
[08:42:31] <Gho5t> http://jsfiddle.net/smntc/1/
[08:43:10] <TheWhisper> Hi
[08:43:21] <TheWhisper> I'm just starting jQuery and I can't get a seemingly basic thing to work
[08:43:24] <TheWhisper> Can anyone take a look?
[08:43:39] <systemfault> TheWhisper: Give us something to look at :)
[08:43:59] <systemfault> slick-: You probably won't find something as easy as flash :/
[08:44:04] <TheWhisper> sec
[08:44:19] <basiclaser> Gho5t: did you change any code ? why does nothing ever work when i don't use jsfiddle :D
[08:44:30] <Gho5t> I add the jquery library on the left
[08:44:32] <TheWhisper> I have this working with .click() http://jsfiddle.net/Whisper/ytxEz/1/
[08:44:37] <basiclaser> yeh cool
[08:44:38] <TheWhisper> But I want to make it toggleable
[08:44:44] <Gho5t> are you sure you're including it in your local project
[08:44:50] <TheWhisper> so I used .toggle() in here http://jsfiddle.net/Whisper/Kym3U/1/
[08:44:53] <basiclaser> you went with 1.8 ? is that more reliable than 1.9?
[08:44:55] <TheWhisper> but it doesn't work now
[08:45:04] <Gho5t> no just seems to be more common
[08:45:13] <TheWhisper> So essentially, how do I make the .toggle() work? :P
[08:45:31] <TheWhisper> (and the images are unlinked, but the alt tags should still show up for them to show what I mean)
[08:45:51] <systemfault> TheWhisper: The toggle should be on the red button?
[08:45:55] <TheWhisper> yes
[08:45:58] <TheWhisper> same as the .click
[08:45:58] <basiclaser> Gho5t: in any case this was just above that script <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[08:46:22] <Gho5t> why no http
[08:46:38] <swz> can somebody help me about last my question? (is there any way to make a working pop under under chrome? i tried many solutions with chrome 25, none of them work) thanks in advance
[08:47:03] <basiclaser> Gho5t: fixed it ! :D
[08:47:04] <Gho5t> oic
[08:47:08] <Gho5t> weird
[08:47:08] <systemfault> TheWhisper: An easy way is to add a class on the button when you click on it, do the animation... and when you reclick on it, you check if the class is there... if so, remove it and do another anim
[08:47:15] <basiclaser> why do i have a crap src like that in my template :P
[08:47:15] <Gho5t> the docs do say to leave it out
[08:47:33] <TheWhisper> systemfault, but the documentation says .toggle() is the proper way to do it, no?
[08:47:34] <basiclaser> hmm well it worked immediately with it added in
[08:48:09] <Gho5t> ok fair enough then
[08:48:35] <slick-> anyone here know the pros and cons for spritely and the lazy painter query plugins
[08:49:02] <systemfault> TheWhisper: http://jsfiddle.net/ytxEz/2/
[08:49:28] <basiclaser> thanks ghost
[08:49:41] <systemfault> TheWhisper: I'm not sure .toggle exists anymore..
[08:49:51] <TheWhisper> hm
[08:49:59] <TheWhisper> I'm using 1.7.2
[08:50:01] <TheWhisper> where it should
[08:50:27] <TheWhisper> thank you though, systemfault
[08:50:30] <systemfault> TheWhisper: Yeah, it exists, doesn't seem flexible enough..
[08:55:38] <church_> systemfault: that generator is good! very good. but i still find with the font sizes of 18 < 26 there is a pixalation. :(
[08:56:52] <systemfault> Sad :/ I've been luckier... is it possible that unfortunately.. the font is the problem? :(
[09:01:50] <ohcibi> hi i have something like if (bogus) { alert("hello"); } where bogus is undefined and instead of just not executing the if, I get an uncaught reference error, what am I missing?
[09:04:02] <j105rob> ohcibi: I'll take a stab....
[09:04:20] <ohcibi> j105rob: ?
[09:04:32] <j105rob> bogus has no reference
[09:04:44] <ohcibi> jep?
[09:04:58] <j105rob> so you can't test it
[09:05:03] <ohcibi> oO
[09:05:42] <j105rob> have you previously defined bogus in that scope?
[09:06:08] <j105rob> bogus== undefined would return true
[09:06:18] <ohcibi> j105rob: no i tried that already... i get the same error
[09:06:19] <j105rob> if bogus is undefined
[09:07:07] <j105rob> you know what they say, jsfiddle or it didn't happen :)
[09:07:10] <ohcibi> j105rob: so youre saying that i need a var bogus; in the same scope before...
[09:07:15] <j105rob> post it so we can look at it
[09:07:45] <j105rob> well, it depends on what bogus *is*
[09:08:02] <j105rob> or meant to be
[09:09:49] <ohcibi> j105rob: http://jsbin.com/ajicob/1/edit
[09:10:03] <ohcibi> j105rob: bogus is a var, that is either already set or not (depending on some script that is loaded - or not before)
[09:10:15] <ohcibi> and i want to just set a fallback-value in case it is not set
[09:12:28] <ohcibi> j105rob: i dont know, the jsbin is not even working if you do var bogus; before the if... but i solved my issue by doing so... so thx 8-)
[09:12:34] <j105rob> http://jsbin.com/ajicob/3/
[09:13:01] <j105rob> ^^ ohcibi
[09:13:31] <ohcibi> j105rob: hm seems the reload of jsbin is broken, if i just load the example _with_ var bogus; it works...
[09:13:50] <atomiku> How can I changePage with ajax to an external URL, but load it within the app intead of going to that page?
[09:14:05] <atomiku> it seems once i've called changePage, everything else that was cached (including <script>) is lost
[09:15:10] <ohcibi> atomiku: if i understand right you could do jqobject.load(url) to insert the contents of url into the jqobject
[09:15:23] <atomiku> hmm ouch
[09:15:30] <atomiku> but that'd lose page transitions etc
[09:15:34] <atomiku> as far as I can tell
[09:15:46] <ohcibi> what transitions?
[09:15:50] <atomiku> slideup etc
[09:16:05] <ohcibi> atomiku: you mean of the other page?
[09:16:08] <atomiku> Yeah
[09:17:54] <atomiku> actually wait, disregard everything I said. the bug in particular was being caused by something else. relative URls.

[09:44:36] <Grunewald> Hello there anyone have any experience using JqueryMobile and IcoMoon together ?
[09:45:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have an element with 'display:none;' for css and then I do this: $('#result_a').show().fadeOut('slow');
[09:46:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why does that not work?
[09:46:42] <jedimind_> Grunewald, you don't need any such specific experience
[09:47:15] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: Why do you show() is then hide it with fadeOut?!?
[09:47:23] <systemfault> s/is/it
[09:47:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> It's a save button, it should show that text 1 sec and then fade away again
[09:47:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> "changes saved." it says
[09:48:23] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: Write a testcase on jsfiddle :(
[09:48:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[09:51:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> systemfault: http://jsfiddle.net/wzT4H/
[09:52:39] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: Missing a ) at the end
[09:52:57] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: That's a syntax error, your console should have shown you that.
[09:54:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Yes, forgot a ) http://jsfiddle.net/wzT4H/3/
[09:55:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://jsfiddle.net/wzT4H/4/
[09:55:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> wtf, here it works
[09:55:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> gay
[09:56:02] <snover> i assume you mean happy
[09:56:15] <snover> like, “i am so gay because this works here”
[09:57:02] <basiclaser> like, 'let's all be gay together to celebrate ecky's gayness'
[09:57:07] <gandolf> Does anyone know why this vidoe won't open in its lightbox? I have the scripts enqued properly, just not sure if I am targeting the element right

[09:57:50] <gandolf> the push to start button
[09:58:21] <gandolf> I have something like jQuery("#layerslider_1 a.ls-s2").prettyPhoto(); but am not sure why it isnt working
[10:00:40] <Inazad> I have a problem passing the content (from a variable) to the modal construtor
[10:00:44] <gandolf> anyone? :(
[10:00:49] <Inazad> here's the code : http://codepad.org/fPXYuTxV
[10:00:56] <Inazad> I have a problem passing the content (from a variable) to the modal construtor
[10:01:31] <Inazad> $.modal({                         content: d,        the 'd' isn't defined... I get an error while trying to pop up the modal
[10:06:35] <bobby_> can anyone please point me in right direction on how this website is developed http://jiouhe.com/
[10:09:49] <Cork> bobby_: how its developed?
[10:12:13] <bobby_> yes
[10:12:34] <bobby_> i mean ..what javascript plugin is used
[10:13:53] <bobby_> does it use any jquery plugin , how did they get that scroll effect
[10:15:41] <postoy> it's not just one query plug-in and there's custom script involved with what appears to be css3 transforms/transitions. are you asking for how to do the techniques?
[10:16:11] <bobby_> yes..!!
[10:16:43] <postoy> there are two important jquery libraries that i am seeing: query.mousewheel.js and jquery-animate-css-rotate-scale.js
[10:17:33] <bobby_> hmm...are they custom js libraries
[10:17:39] <Cork> bobby_: it listens to the scroll event on the window, and then it calculates what to based on how many of those events it has gotten, and in what direction
[10:17:59] <Cork> bobby_: and then it updates different areas with position values and transform based on that value
[10:18:40] <postoy> it's also using css transforms, transitions with a jquery library.
[10:19:03] <bobby_> hmm..but i really like the technique they used.!! Does it have a name...
[10:20:06] <Snicers-Work2> hey, for superfish menus, how do you make it so mobile browsers click activates the dropdown instead of navigating to the page?
[10:20:13] <bobby_> how do they  do scrolling horizontally
[10:20:20] <postoy> there's a name for that style of layout, where all links are one homepage (i forget the name of it at the moment) and navigate downwards. in this case, they're navigating in different directions using transforms and transitions.
[10:20:51] <postoy> @bobby: css3 with a jquery library.
[10:21:19] <carpii> i have some html in my page which i want to clone. Is it just a case of doing  $("body").append($("#myHtmlTemplate")) ?
[10:21:39] <postoy> obviously, i haven't looked at it in depth, but that's what is apparent to the plug-ins they're using.
[10:22:11] <bobby_> hmm..thanks..!!
[10:22:15] <systemfault> carpii: I'd be surprised
[10:22:37] <postoy> look at the library and check out experiments using css3 transforms and transitions.
[10:22:44] <carpii> yup, me too. Just not sure how else to approach it
[10:22:58] <bobby_> yes..i should do that...
[10:23:11] <systemfault> carpii: You'll need to .clone() the element... then change to id of the clone because you cannot have two elements with the same id in the DOM
[10:23:19] <systemfault> And finally append it.
[10:23:26] <postoy> .clone()
[10:23:30] <postoy> ah, si.
[10:23:37] <carpii> ah nice thanks. Id catered for the id change, just not the .clone()
[10:23:41] <postoy> clone() makes a duplicate.
[10:23:47] <postoy> obviously. ;)
[10:24:52] <carpii> sweet works a treat, thanks guys
[10:25:25] <postoy> the example from jquery docs: $('.hello').clone().appendTo('.goodbye');
[10:26:19] <systemfault> Having two elements with the same ID is illegal :P So watch for that.
[10:26:55] <Snicers-Work2> Does anyone know how to get mobile friendly superfish menus working?
[10:27:01] <carpii> yep, got it coverd ta :)
[10:30:04] <postoy> @Snicers: Just replace them with regular dropdowns?
[10:30:31] <postoy> You shouldn't be using JS to create drop down menus.
[10:36:41] <p3lim_> I'm using cloaked forwarding to display a subdomain as a site, but I have an issue with <title> and <link> not beeing added, since the whole html container is wrapped
[10:36:47] <p3lim_> Is there some easy way to remedy this?
[10:37:23] <p3lim> I've been looking for a way to create a title element on the first head, with no success
[10:39:30] <bartmax> p3lim: $('head')[0].append('<title></title>');
[10:40:01] <carpii> are you sure about the [0]~?
[10:40:08] <carpii> since then its a dom object not a jquery object, right?
[10:40:50] <p3lim> And great, my webhost wen't down so I can't test :/
[10:41:12] <bartmax> carpii: you are right, safer to use first()
[10:41:30] <postoy> It sounds like you need a new host, why are you masking a redirection?
[10:41:34] <bartmax> should be $('head').first().append('<title></title>');
[10:42:06] <jrockjiggz> or $('head').eq(0)
[10:42:18] <p3lim> only solution I found to having http://foo.bar.com/ instead of http://bar.com/foo.html
[10:42:40] <postoy> ah, i see.
[10:43:04] <p3lim> And yeah, I know I need to find a new host :P
[10:43:18] <p3lim> No apache, no shell, no cgi, nothing
[10:43:30] <p3lim> Just some basic settings and ftp access, but it was cheap
[10:43:35] <postoy> I recommend namecheap.com
[10:44:06] <p3lim> I've already found one that I liked, just waiting for this month to run out
[10:44:18] <postoy> Namecheap also offers $13 VPS.
[10:44:23] <postoy> ah, cool.
[10:44:57] <thinkerweb> whats vps?
[10:45:06] <p3lim> nice, they're using cPanel too
[10:45:08] <postoy> Virtual Private Server
[10:45:14] <thinkerweb> how much
[10:45:14] <p3lim> I love that thing
[10:45:41] <p3lim> Wow, you get a lot for the money at namecheap
[10:45:41] <postoy> $13 or $15 if you pay month by month.
[10:45:52] <postoy> Yeah, that's why I'm recommending them. ;)
[10:46:00] <thinkerweb> whats the big deal of VPS vs regular hosting account for $5/mo?
[10:46:25] <postoy> You get full root access and more power and bandwidth.
[10:46:32] <thinkerweb> more domains?
[10:46:36] <postoy> Yeah.
[10:46:39] <postoy> That too.
[10:46:53] <postoy> But the great part is is that you have root.
[10:46:56] <andres__> why does prependTo inserts an element always on top of a list
[10:46:56] <postoy> You can install anything you want.
[10:47:02] <thinkerweb> what you gonna do with root access?
[10:47:13] <p3lim> The one I've been looking at gives me 2gb, and the rest is identical to the "value" package from namecheap
[10:47:22] <p3lim> Which costs $2.50
[10:47:26] <p3lim> per month
[10:47:37] <postoy> @andres_ That's what "prepend" means. Are you wanting AppendTo?
[10:47:48] <thinkerweb> I host for free on Mozilla
[10:48:14] <postoy> $2.50 a month sounds /too/ cheap.
[10:48:26] <thinkerweb> 000webhost is pretty good too, but Mozilla has pear too, which I never used yet, or know how yet, but it avalable if I ever learn how to
[10:48:28] <p3lim> for 2gb tho
[10:48:52] <p3lim> their 50gb package costs $9-ish
[10:48:56] <p3lim> :p
[10:49:10] <andres__> postoy:  yes sir thanks
[10:49:16] <p3lim> But that one has bandwidth limits
[10:49:17] <thinkerweb> 000webhost and mozilla is cpanel
[10:50:39] <p3lim> lol the free plan from 000webhost is not that bad
[10:50:44] <p3lim> considering it's free
[10:51:05] <thinkerweb> I find those free ones to be same as the paid ones
[10:51:08] <p3lim> hell, the premium is great too
[10:59:37] <p3lim> and btw, .append() didn't work
[10:59:58] <mieszkos> someone made a website for mobile?

[11:02:05] <systemfault> fail;)
[11:02:33] <rzec> haha, yea, time to change password
[11:02:34] <systemfault> rzec: Time to change your pass..
[11:05:30] <mieszkos> anyoen can helppp
[11:05:32] <mieszkos> :(
[11:05:56] <lanken> what are the best things about 1.5 and 1.6?
[11:07:03] <systemfault> lanken: They're not 1.4?
[11:08:50] <p3lim> rzec: always do that in the server channel :p
[11:09:52] <rzec> p3lim: yea, I generally do but for some reason lime chat logged me into this channel automatically, need to prevent that from happening
[11:10:13] <p3lim> What OS you running?
[11:10:39] <p3lim> Actually, doesn't matter: http://www.quassel-irc.org/
[11:10:49] <shake> hello everyone
[11:12:03] <carpii> if im importing jquery UI just so I can use draggable and resiable, do I still need to import jqueryUI .css ?
[11:12:32] <shake> i was wondering if anyone could help me, im working with $().getJSON, im working wiht a super simple api, dribbble's api, im making a request to it for an id number and nothing seems to be working until i finally add ?callback=? to the end of the url
[11:12:41] <shake> can someone explain why haha
[11:12:59] <systemfault> shake: Because that API is JSONP?
[11:12:59] <p3lim> Gah, how the hell do I get rid of the nasty orange outline on textboxes for chrome :/
[11:13:31] <systemfault> p3lim: CSS,  set outline: none; on them...
[11:13:53] <p3lim> Thanks :)
[11:13:54] <systemfault> p3lim: You might want to set a different style on focus for accessibility if you do that.
[11:14:00] <shake> systemfault: is that something that jquery wouldnt be able to determin? also i guess i dont understand the syntax of ?callback=? (maybe thats the issue)
[11:15:44] <systemfault> shake: Normally, ajax calls are bound by the same origin policy rule
[11:16:02] <systemfault> shake: You cannot do cross-domain communications
[11:16:30] <shake> systemfault: i was readng that, so ANY cross domain needs to be jsonp?
[11:16:31] <systemfault> shake: There's a way to do it...(CORS) but it's not supported by every browser
[11:16:34] <raj> I have a list of hair salons that I want to load with the html page. I just don't know where to place them
[11:16:52] <raj> I imagine it should be somewhere in the html
[11:17:13] <systemfault> shake: So, as a workaround for the crossdomain issue, JSONP was invented.
[11:18:17] <shake> systemfault: youve been really helpful thank, but lastly the =? in the callback , that just refer to the proceeding function?
[11:18:19] <systemfault> shake: JSONP is an ugly hack, instead of using AJAX(XHR), you create a <script> element, then set its src to whatever but you pass it the name of a callback
[11:18:57] <systemfault> <script src="http://whatever.com/myapi?callback=lol"></script>
[11:19:22] <shake> lol being a fucntion to deal with the data
[11:19:25] <systemfault> Then the server side would send the following Javascript: lol(jsonhere);
[11:19:29] <shake> ah
[11:19:40] <shake> systemfault: kudos
[11:19:44] <postoy> or you can use xml.
[11:19:54] <systemfault> postoy: It doesn't change anything..
[11:22:16] <swez_> hello, how can i make a pop under working chrome 25? tried a lot of variations without any proper result
[11:22:32] <postoy> this is interesting: https://www.bionicspirit.com/blog/2011/03/24/cross-domain-requests.html
[11:22:58] <systemfault> Yeah.. CORS, too bad it's not properly supported on older IE.
[11:24:28] <postoy> @swez_: we don't give that kind of advice around here. ;)
[11:24:43] <swez_> why?
[11:25:21] <postoy> because pop unders are associated with abusive ad techniques. do you have a legitimate reason for using one?
[11:26:00] <swez_> oh i dont even want to advertise, just for inhouse testing
[11:26:29] <eddyb> did anyone here play with jQuery and the ES6 async feature present in traceur-compiler?
[11:33:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If you hide a certain block of html with hide(), is there a way to automatically scroll up  a certain amount so it won't stay at a blank area?
[11:33:26] <carpii> what blank area?
[11:33:30] <NoiseEee> ecky--ptang-zoob: it shouldn't be a "blank area", it should just disappear.  sounds like you're using "hidden" isntead of "none" for display
[11:33:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the area that got hidden
[11:33:49] <carpii> or youre hiding the contents of a container, and the container is reminaing display:block
[11:33:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> well I use fadeOut(), it's a big block of html
[11:33:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh ok
[11:45:18] <level9> If I have one source of draggable elements and multiple drop areas. How can achieve that each element can only be droped one time in each drop area?
[11:46:26] <NoiseEee> level9: set up an object to track that bizness?
[11:47:25] <level9> NoiseEee: You mean to listen to the drop event and watch if its already in there?
[11:53:39] <NoiseEee> level9: or add to an object on drop.  var droppedStuff = {zone1:[file1,file2], zone2: []}   etc
[11:53:57] <NoiseEee> when about to drop, see if the object/file is associated with the drop zone, if so, abandon
[11:56:12] <level9> i try that thanks
[12:07:16] <culh> History.js, that enables coders to use history.pushState() for non html5 browsers was discontinued. Anyone know a good substitute? I'm looking at Ben Alman's jQuery hashchange event, but I believe it doens't include history manipulation function.
[12:07:28] <culh> functionS*
[12:10:53] <carpii> when i call .draggable()  on a div with position:absolute, it seems to override it with position:relative. Anyone know why this is?
[12:11:13] <naeluh> Hi I have a fiddle where I can add consecutive unique divs and I am trying to setup a button that deletes them if someone made a mistake - I can only get it to hide the entire set is there a way to just get the last one that was shown ? here is the fiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/U9HSM/
[12:11:55] <carpii> whats the live() business ?
[12:12:07] <naeluh> not sure I just added it
[12:12:15] <carpii> yeah it doesnt belong :p
[12:12:20] <naeluh> it doesn't do anythign
[12:12:23] <naeluh> ok
[12:12:49] <naeluh> i updated iut
[12:12:51] <naeluh> it
[12:12:58] <naeluh> maybe .last()
[12:13:04] <naeluh> or something like that
[12:13:36] <carpii> yes but you also need to specify last visible
[12:13:44] <carpii> because right now its just hiding the last one, which might already be hidden
[12:14:02] <naeluh> ok so would I have to add an extra class
[12:14:21] <culh> .live() is for content loaded by ajax calls after the first page load; or at least it used to be for that purpose
[12:14:47] <naeluh> yeah I was just messing around
[12:15:48] <CodeFriar> does $(document).onReady() fire after all the js is loaded?
[12:16:18] <whitby> Once all the DOM content has loaded.
[12:16:24] <whitby> Not JS.
[12:17:21] <naeluh> is there a doc where I can see how to specify the last  div element
[12:17:40] <CodeFriar> naeluh: ('div:last')
[12:18:55] <naeluh> $("#btnDel").click(function () {$('div:last').hide();});
[12:19:04] <carpii> naeluh: you also need to give your controls unique id's
[12:19:05] <naeluh> this didnt wrk ?
[12:19:20] <carpii> (or omit them altogether)
[12:19:54] <naeluh> carpii: thanks I am not sure what you mean by controls the buttons ?
[12:19:56] <naeluh> thanks again '
[12:20:12] <carpii> the divs i think, or the inputs. I dont remember since ive closed it
[12:20:21] <shoelessone> So I've got something of a stupid basic question: when do I need to "preventDefault" on an anchor tag to prevent it from doing anything?
[12:20:22] <carpii> but you have id="name1" on a few of them
[12:20:45] <samuel02> what's the best way of finding all elements between two sibling elements, really it should be a combined prevUntil and nextUntil
[12:20:46] <naeluh> oh yeah I do havev that
[12:20:48] <samuel02> =
[12:20:49] <samuel02> ?
[12:20:53] <CodeFriar> I'm trying to use the datepicker with x-editable but whenever I enable editable on a date field I get can't call method 'parseFormat' on undefined. The undefined in this case is a date picker object ... which is, seemingly undefined. Any pointers on tracking down why it's not being auto-constructed?
[12:20:54] <shoelessone> And by "when" I mean, is there some sort of time limit type thing?
[12:21:29] <whitby> naeluh: If you're refering to the fiddle you posted, try $("#btnDel").click(function () { $('div:visible').last().hide(); });
[12:21:52] <carpii> shoe, if youre handling a click on a <a>, then after wards the browser will treat it as a normal weblink unless you preventDefayult
[12:21:58] <naeluh> whitby: ok I am referring to that I will try that
[12:22:36] <naeluh> whitby: div:visible awesome !!
[12:23:00] <naeluh> whitby: thanks
[12:23:05] <whitby> No prob.
[12:25:59] <Motafoca> guys, is it possible to disable double clicking on the hole page using jquery? found alot of tutorials on internet for inputs and forms, but nothing for the hole page, the reason i need that is because its a touchscreen enviroment and doubleclicking is a bit anoying behaving
[12:26:11] <kripster> bit of a silly question but how do I remove the select from the dropdown select but leave it on the drop down display at start http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/56/? thanks
[12:29:46] <CodeFriar> I'm trying to use the datepicker with x-editable but whenever I enable editable on a date field I get can't call method 'parseFormat' on undefined. The undefined in this case is a date picker object ... which is, seemingly undefined. Any pointers on tracking down why it's not being auto-constructed?
[12:35:07] <kripster> how do i display the select on dropdown as default but not have it included in dropdown, any ideas http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/56/?
[12:39:36] <kripster> is it not something very simple?
[12:41:33] <[fields]> kripster: afaik, you can create an option that is disabled, and this is similar, but may not be precisely what you are looking for
[12:42:44] <kripster> fields: what do you mean, all i want is the dropdown by default to be labelled select but then when you click on dropdown the select is not included as the list as there is no reason to choose select, does that make sense lol?
[12:43:30] <[fields]> yes you make sense, but HTML does do that
[12:43:40] <whitby> kripster: what [fields] says is to have `<option disabled` which prevents it from being selected
[12:44:11] <whitby> It's the closest I can think of as well.
[12:44:45] <[fields]> I think to achieve precisely what you want you need a select with only one option and onfocus of that you rewrite the select to contain only the options you want.  also write jquery for onblur to detect if any are selected and if not then revert back to original "placeholder" select
[12:45:45] <whitby> kripster: http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/58/
[12:46:06] <whitby> It's close but not exactly what you're looking for.
[12:53:57] <kripster> whitby: not bad thanks, anyone else got any ideas?
[12:57:39] <carpii> whats wrong with whitbys idea?
[12:58:29] <kripster> yeah I think its very good, was just wondering if there was a way to complete remove it from dropdown
[12:59:05] <carpii> there probably is with a little work, but then you get into all sorts of things like the selectedIndex changing, and its kinda unconventional
[12:59:46] <carpii> maybe you should just use radio buttons, which seem to cater for what you want functionally, if not visually
[12:59:48] <kripster> yeah agreed carpii, thanks again whitby
[13:01:07] <whitby> kripster: no problem. it was [fields] idea too
[13:02:09] <kripster> yeah thanks to both of you
[13:05:07] <j0nr> hello all. I have a quick question. In the middle of a <script> I need to write ...'location: "myurl.com/track/id/var1/var2" where var1 and var2 have just been defined in the <script> previously.
[13:05:14] <j0nr> I need to somehow echo the values...
[13:07:20] <whitby> j0nr: echo how?
[13:07:36] <whitby> to the console? write on the page?
[13:14:07] <j0nr> whitby: the line I need to appear in my script is: new OpenLayers.Layer.Text( "Markers", { location:"/tracks/mkInfo/35/lat/lon/",... etc
[13:14:34] <j0nr> _BUT_ 'lat' and 'lon' are variables.
[13:14:34] <[fields]> document.write ?
[13:14:39] <rickibalboa> what does OpenLayers.. etc return? A html element?
[13:14:56] <j0nr> so what I really need is new OpenLayers.Layer.Text( "Markers", { location:"/tracks/mkInfo/35/6.7890/1.2345/",
[13:14:57] <[fields]> j0nr:  oh, just build a string before this line and use location: str
[13:15:18] <j0nr> [fields]: tat sounds like the sort of thing I need
[13:15:25] <j0nr> s/tat/that/
[13:15:27] <[fields]> or just implement your vars with concatenation
[13:15:45] <j0nr> [fields]: what is that last one?
[13:16:00] <[fields]> "/tracks/mkInfo/35/"+var1+"/"+var2+"/"
[13:18:52] <j0nr> [fields]: I am just getting /tracks/mkInfo/35/"+var1+"/"+var2+"/ being returned
[13:21:13] <[fields]> jsfiddle?
[13:23:46] <kripster> sorry guys have a styling issue, how do I bold the select your make and increase the width of the dropdown and centre it?? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/61/
[13:25:16] <[fields]> well thats odd looking
[13:26:53] <j0nr> [fields]: not sure how to show you: http://pastebin.com/2GMhsgQ2
[13:27:04] <kripster> fields: yeah i know, looks a mess
[13:27:07] <whitby> j0nr: as [fields] suggested, string concatenation is the way to go
[13:27:48] <whitby> j0nr: the line should be location:"/tracks/mkInfo/id/" + lat + "/" + lon + "/"
[13:30:16] <j0nr> whitby: whitby oh, so the spaces matter
[13:30:38] <whitby> not the spaces, but more the quotes and equals signs.
[13:30:50] <[fields]> kripster: http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/63/
[13:31:38] <whitby> j0nr: Not the spaces, but more the quotes and equals signs. You're adding (or concatenating) the values to the strings.
[13:33:40] <culh> How does some recently updated sites change the URL while navigating with ajax without reloading the page? Is is throught frames?
[13:33:40] <j0nr> whitby: hmm I think the problem is that this is in the middle of a php echo
[13:34:01] <j0nr> I'll have to assign var lat to a separate php $var
[13:34:13] <whitby> culh: using AJAX and changing the hash
[13:34:17] <kripster> fields: thanks, how would position the dropdown to the left instead of having it centered?
[13:34:23] <culh> whitby: not talking about hash
[13:35:48] <culh> whitby: URL from domain/var1  to domain/var1/var2/...  and no page refresh
[13:36:53] <[fields]> kripster:  don't know, experiment
[13:37:24] <culh> whitby: it's done easily using html5, but I need it degradable to non html5
[13:37:25] <whitby> culh: if those are actual new resource URLs, then a whole new resource would need to be fetched by a browser.
[13:38:37] <culh> whitby: have you navigated throught github latelly?
[13:39:37] <culh> For instance: this is the uncontinued js https://github.com/balupton/History.js
[13:40:01] <whitby> culh: You are correct. It must be using `window.history`
[13:40:08] <culh> But looking at github's navigation, you click on a folder and the URL changes, no hash and no refresh
[13:40:27] <culh> how the hell are they doing this?
[13:40:41] <[fields]> culh:  ajax man
[13:41:07] <tw2113> mmm ajax
[13:41:11] <culh> I know it's using ajax for the load, but how is the url changing and the page not refreshing?
[13:41:23] <tw2113> history api
[13:41:26] <culh> iframes would be my first guess
[13:41:37] <[fields]> culh:  $.get( requestURL, function(returnData){  /* do something with return data like write to a div and perform animation */ });
[13:41:43] <shoky> .g pushstate @ culh
[13:41:44] <b-ot> culh: Sorry, no results for ‟pushstate @ culh”.
[13:41:53] <shoky> .g pushstate
[13:41:53] <b-ot> shoky: Manipulating the browser history - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[13:41:55] <shoky> culh ^
[13:42:15] <culh> I read it, but I thought it was to do with the Back button
[13:42:17] <tw2113> shoky and i agree
[13:42:23] <[fields]> could be a link to '#'
[13:42:48] <culh> I really would want to use this on a personal project of mine
[13:42:52] <[fields]> like an a href anchor.... changes url to append #, but doesn't truly change page
[13:42:58] <culh> so if I pushState to history it'll change the url?
[13:43:04] <shoky> try it..
[13:43:29] <culh> Cutting edge tecs, eh? nIIIIce
[13:43:38] <shoky> culh: run this in console.. history.pushState({}, "blaa", "wow.html")
[13:43:44] <culh> I hope it doesn't mess up my other scripts
[13:46:04] <whitby> culh: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history#Example
[13:46:39] <whitby> That's the particular example.
[13:46:58] <whitby> You may want to check if(window.history.pushState) first
[13:47:46] <culh> cool, but it was 'Introduced in Gecko 2'
[13:47:55] <whitby> Works in Chrome...
[13:48:20] <culh> So the degradable plugins out there simply use hash changes instead?
[13:48:59] <shoky> yeap
[13:49:00] <culh> I remember the first scripts that came out right after ajax that used a hidden iframe to keep history
[13:49:12] <culh> ok
[13:49:58] <culh> Nice to see Gecko browsers looping forward from M$ again
[13:50:05] <culh> = more work for us
[13:55:32] <veQue> is $([id$!="'+myChar+'"]) a valid selector?
[13:55:49] <veQue> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/ i was looking at this
[13:56:27] <systemfault> Nope...
[13:56:31] <systemfault> Why would it be?
[13:56:36] <bwen> is it possible to set a timeout to $.getScript() if the site is really slow it seems to be waiting for ever.. I need to shorten that wait time to 5seconds. Any ideas?
[13:58:50] <culh> bwen: use local files?
[13:59:45] <veQue> systemfault: because [name$="value"] is and [name!="value"] is
[14:00:56] <whitby> veQue: what are you trying to select?
[14:01:37] <veQue> the last character
[14:01:41] <veQue> sorry...
[14:01:42] <systemfault> veQue: != is a jquery-ism, not a real CSS selector, you could do:    ':not([name$="value"])' I guess
[14:01:47] <veQue> in the id string
[14:02:21] <veQue> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-not-equal-selector/ but this?
[14:02:36] <veQue> but i'm gonna try your way thanks
[14:03:05] <systemfault> veQue: Read the:  This selector is equivalent to....
[14:03:10] <NoiseEee> veQue: " use $("your-pure-css-selector").not('[name="value"]') instead."
[14:04:02] <veQue> NoiseEee: as opposed to :not ?
[14:04:12] <veQue> or it works the same as?
[14:04:58] <systemfault> veQue: His way is perhaps more performant, I don't know
[14:11:14] <NoiseEee> veQue: honestly, read the damn page.
[14:11:15] <kripster> is there a way to enable the enter key to act like a tab button so when i select enter in the textfield it jumps to next textfield? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/65/
[14:11:24] <NoiseEee> " For better performance in modern browsers, use $("your-pure-css-selector").not('[name="value"]') instead."
[14:11:46] <NoiseEee> kripster: you might want to rethink that; it breaks the way users expect things to behave.
[14:11:48] <veQue> NoiseEee: works like a charm thanks
[14:11:57] <veQue> :)
[14:12:11] <NoiseEee> great veQue
[14:12:54] <veQue> i'd just use :not when i dont have a pure selector
[14:14:35] <kripster> NoiseEee: what do you mean, i am designing this for mobile app so as there is not tab key i was wanting to use the enter key to move from fields, any thoughts>?
[14:18:09] <kripster> NoiseEee: would something like this not work? http://jsfiddle.net/andrewwhitaker/GRtQY/
[14:19:35] <NoiseEee> kripster: sure it would work, but its just not what people expect
[14:19:54] <NoiseEee> be careful of trying to outsmart your users by breaking basic assumptions
[14:20:02] <NoiseEee> you can do what you wish, obv
[14:21:24] <johnkary> i'm trying to use a jquery plugin which does:  (function($){  })(jQuery);    but Chrome console tells me "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function" on that first line (function($)     i'm also certain jQuery is included before my plugin and i'm not using noConflict()

[15:38:34] <naeluh> hey so do you have an example ? of yo setup make sure you got jquery and the plugin loaded up and then make sure your markup is corerect there are some demos there start with that maybe whats the issue
[15:48:13] <CapMax> naeluh: umm...i dont have an example unfortunately, but everything should be set up fine, i get no js errors in the console
[15:48:48] <naeluh> then you should check your cache check your jquery version check your ids and classes
[15:50:22] <aghouseh> best way to store an array of jquery objects to later be inserted into the dom without having to create an actual DOM element to contain them? (dealing with <li/>)
[15:50:24] <aghouseh> ?
[15:50:53] <aghouseh> im just using array.push($item); for now, but seems like i could be doing it easier
[15:52:03] <kristofers> i've got a table with one default row, you can then click on + on the side of the 1st row to add a new row,
[15:52:05] <adamsilver> any idea how can I translate this from python to js: http://bpaste.net/show/CW86zYcO7FjzBVxLlqEs/
[15:52:29] <kristofers> the second row is appended after the first one
[15:52:52] <kristofers> but the + on the 2nd and other row doesn't work
[15:53:21] <kristofers> the other rows are being added dynamically is there something i need to do ?
[15:53:27] <kristofers> my .each() isn't working
[15:53:49] <kristofers> it's not working on the dynamically generated ro
[15:53:50] <kristofers> row
[16:11:49] * boytoy dances around like he's had too much pcp
[16:12:34] <naeluh> hey the future is here http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/25/nike-3d-printed-cleat/
[16:13:34] <myrman> i feel the same?
[16:14:52] <carpii> does IE not support JSON.* ?
[16:15:26] <carpii> ah nevermind, i was in IE8 mode, but with ie7 document standards
[16:16:10] <capt_blackwood> anybody want to help me solve a wordpress and jquery problem?

[16:16:17] <capt_blackwood> Accordions won't work
[16:16:53] <Sam_____> It's working for me in chrome capt
[16:17:39] <capt_blackwood> the latest ff's not running it
[16:17:45] <capt_blackwood> hmmn
[16:18:51] <Sam_____> checked ff and working as well
[16:19:01] <capt_blackwood> must be my ff then
[16:20:32] <capt_blackwood> yep it was me O.o
[16:20:38] <capt_blackwood> thanks for the help
[16:25:51] <capt_blackwood> down here http://pegasus.alexandersdesigns.net/about-pegasus/ do the tabs work Sam_____
[16:25:53] <capt_blackwood> ???
[16:32:41] <capt_blackwood> Ok. I can't get the custom theme to work with this plugin :(
[16:58:46] <CapMax> anyone use qtip?
[16:58:53] <CapMax> i cant get any options apart from content to work
[17:03:23] <capt_blackwood> is it possible to set a fixed height to the accordion
[17:03:28] <capt_blackwood> Mine's rather...large
[17:03:35] <capt_blackwood> http://pegasus.alexandersdesigns.net/about-pegasus/
[17:10:38] <vladikoff> capt_blackwood, http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-heightStyle
[17:21:55] <capt_blackwood> does it have to be one of those styles or can i set a pixel dimention?
[17:47:36] <vladikoff> capt_blackwood, i think you just need a parent el with a height set to what you want
[17:47:52] <capt_blackwood> ah. Thanks :)
[17:47:54] <vladikoff> capt_blackwood, + heightStyle fill
[17:48:44] <capt_blackwood> tanks for the help everybody
[17:51:20] <basiclaser> are there any smart ways of making the area around your cursor glow in jquery , illuminating the webpage?
[17:58:02] <d3m0n> Anyone know of a 'sticky' jquery plugin that will allow for div boundaries, the one's I've come across float over the whole page instead of contained to a specific height e.g. sidebar
[18:22:10] <dannymichel> The youtube playlist on top autoscrolls. http://dev.dmichel.net/wordpress/ , but when you hover over anywhere in the simply-scroll2 simply-scroll2-container, it pauses. The problem is, i also have left and right arrows that scroll left and right. Is there a way to pause simplyscroll2 JS when I hover over the left and right arrows?
[18:31:01] <heqs> Is there a way to listen for an event when a specific element is inserted into the DOM, and perform some action?
[18:36:27] <BostonMA1776_> Hello. How do I get the 3rd element of a node?
[18:37:11] <coldhead> .find(':nth-child(3)') ?
[18:37:30] <BostonMA1776_> Thank you. I need it in order to run a function on it.
[18:43:51] <Gazpacho> that will not work in the presence of text nodes. see the documentation
[19:03:49] <jrockjiggz2> Hi, having trouble with script not evaluating after i load it into a div - http://dpaste.org/VXhsO/ - line 17
[19:19:52] <gordian> hey guys, anyone know of a plugin like infinite-scroll but one that will work on just one page without pagination links?
[19:20:14] <gordian> i have a very long page with lots of data that needs to be loaded as the user scrolls down otherwise it takes forever
[19:24:00] <nesoi> so I thought I'd solved it, but I still have a problem where when there's a click on a popup, the popup AND the listview under it both get a click event. What should I try to solve this?
[19:30:21] <nesoi> hmm... looks like I did "solve" it by putting in a 500ms delay before processing any more click events on those elements... seems like a kludge though
[19:32:17] <coldhead> then let's get on with our lives and never speak of it again
[19:33:07] <nesoi> heh... good idea coldhead. although when I start adding globals and timeouts I feel dirty
[19:33:35] <myrman> what part of 'never speak of it again' don't you understand?
[19:33:52] <myrman> we don't speak of this any longer, it's dark stuff
[19:34:00] <andres__> You guys see anything wrong with this code http://jsfiddle.net/uTFJH/1/
[19:34:33] <nesoi> perhaps you are right, brothers
[19:34:47] <nesoi> the code will be sealed forever
[19:35:37] <myrman> just like shadow of the colossus
[19:35:45] <myrman> it will be sealed off
[19:36:27] <nesoi> but seriously, have you guys seen something like that b4, and if so is there a more kosher way of solving it?
[19:37:31] <andres__> damn map is not loading
[19:37:40] <myrman> i have no idea what code you're talking about, nesoi
[19:37:44] * myrman looks the other way
[19:38:39] <coldhead> nesoi: i would seriously let it go, popups aren't worth the bother
[19:38:50] <nesoi> myrman : I'm talking about a situation where you have, say, a listview for which you're handling click events on any <li> and you pop up a dialog over it. Then you find that when there's a click on a button in the dialog, whatever <li> is under that button also gets a click even triggered
[19:38:50] <coldhead> but seeing as you're shedding hair over this
[19:39:10] <coldhead> consider inspecting $(event.target).is('.someththing') to ensure the right hting has actually been clicked
[19:39:14] <coldhead> in your handler
[19:39:49] <nesoi> coldhead : that wouldn't fix it because both things can legitimately get a click.
[19:39:49] <LocalPCGuy> I will use event.target.tagName to see if it is the right tag
[19:40:06] <LocalPCGuy> other option could be to stopPropogation in your handler
[19:40:13] <nesoi> I tried that too :)
[19:40:15] <LocalPCGuy> stopPropagation?
[19:40:20] <LocalPCGuy> never spell it right
[19:40:27] <nesoi> stopImmediatePropagation
[19:40:32] <nesoi> I tried it without the immediate too
[19:40:33] <coldhead> debounce() ?
[19:41:38] <nesoi> what I do now is set a global "in_myClick" and if it's true I ignore further clicks. At the end of it, I set a time out and then set that global to false.
[19:41:47] <nesoi> maybe that's not as bad as I think it is?
[19:42:25] <coldhead> debounce is less awful than that
[19:43:00] <Aquaguy> Hello
[19:43:15] <nesoi> heh
[19:43:27] <nesoi> ok, thanks
[19:43:31] <Aquaguy> Is there a plugin that determines the number of thumnails/images/elements should be shown in a row depending on the window/parent size?
[19:43:36] <coldhead> are you SURE you can't use event.target, nesoi ?
[19:43:40] <coldhead> i'll show you what i mean
[19:44:03] <tw2113> *wink wink*
[19:44:54] <LocalPCGuy> other option might be to decouple the two click events so they call different functions.  You can extract the core functionality to a common function both call
[19:45:18] <nesoi> coldhead : I'm pretty sure I can't because what's actually happening is: listview LI is tapped - if condition, popup. after popup, another LI can be touched which may or may not have a popup
[19:45:24] <nesoi> the popup has callbacks on each button
[19:46:05] <LocalPCGuy> nesoi but couldn't you still differentiate between the two by looking at a classname or something else that is different
[19:46:05] <LocalPCGuy> ?
[19:46:22] <coldhead> nesoi: http://jsfiddle.net/D5NbB/
[19:46:46] <coldhead> if you really can't use that i am leaving this channel forever
[19:46:52] <nesoi> LocalPCGuy : the problem is not that I can't differentiate. its that the other li is getting an event when the button above it is touched
[19:47:00] <coldhead> without even having made it through my first day
[19:47:02] <coldhead> :(
[19:47:19] <coldhead> oh well to hell with all of you and your stupid gypsy problems
[19:47:48] <LocalPCGuy> nesoi tried just clobbering the event with return false at the end?
[19:47:51] <LocalPCGuy> heh
[19:48:13] <nesoi> LocalPCGuy : that caused nothing to work when I tried it
[19:48:19] <nesoi> coldhead : that looks perfect! thanks!
[19:48:28] <Aquaguy>  Is there a plugin that determines the number of thumnails/images/elements should be shown in a row depending on the window/parent size?
[19:48:47] <coldhead> nesoi: are you just saying that so i won't quit the channel?
[19:49:09] <nesoi> no, I would never do such a thing. I really appreciate it. I'm going to try to work it into my code.
[19:49:23] <nesoi> I was even using the e.target for something already
[19:49:32] <myrman> <coldhead> oh well to hell with all of you and your stupid gypsy problems
[19:49:34] <myrman> I love this
[19:49:44] <myrman> No offense to any gypsies :P
[19:49:56] <Zak> i wish everybody would quit the channel. then i could finally be alone. alone forever
[19:50:17] <LocalPCGuy> aquaguy do you just need the number or are you looking for more of a layout tool?
[19:52:38] <coldhead> that's sad
[19:52:42] <coldhead> i guess we lost him forever
[19:53:02] <coldhead> b-ot: tell Zak i will never ever forget you
[19:53:13] <coldhead> stupid b-ot
[19:53:36] <coldhead> `tell Zak i will never ever forget you
[19:53:36] <b-ot> coldhead: I’ll tell Zak about that.
[19:53:39] <coldhead> thanks b-ot
[19:54:05] <nesoi> testing
[19:57:48] <nesoi> hmm
[19:57:52] <jrockjiggz2> `globalEval
[19:58:00] <jrockjiggz2> ?globalEval
[19:58:05] <jrockjiggz2> !! :(
[19:58:17] <coldhead> bot-t is dead
[20:04:04] <jrockjiggz2> i'm saddened
[20:04:38] <coldhead> much cause for despair in #jQuery today
[20:05:18] <jrockjiggz2> jquery just aint the same without t
[20:05:40] <the8thbit> JS variables seemed to be acting strangely so I created this testcase: http://pastebin.com/hKgGqS6U
[20:05:51] <the8thbit>  It seems that, when I call jQuery's load function to load a page into a div global variables get reset
[20:05:59] <the8thbit> Is there any way to prevent this?
[20:07:00] <jrockjiggz2> variables do not get reset
[20:07:10] <LocalPCGuy> and stop using global variables?
[20:08:39] <the8thbit> jrockjiggz2: When I click "do_test( )" after clicking "set_test( )" test_var gets set back to "false"
[20:10:05] <the8thbit> Im not sure why that is, though
[20:11:02] <LocalPCGuy> the8thbit you are mixing asynchronous and synchronous functions
[20:11:35] <LocalPCGuy> wait...let me look a bit more
[20:11:39] <coldhead> that's how you keep things interesting
[20:11:46] <LocalPCGuy> heh, sure
[20:12:48] <LocalPCGuy> uhm...nvrmind that last - you are loading testpageb into the page, but it includes a full DOM and calls test.js again, which resets the variable
[20:13:18] <capt_blackwood> just isn't my day with jQuery LOL
[20:13:27] <capt_blackwood> http://www.alexandersdesigns.net/578-2/ <<< do the tabs load for you guys?
[20:14:20] <the8thbit> LocalPCGuy: Thanks, I'll try fixing that.
[20:15:37] <lil-murph> is there a qUnit API or addon for marking tests that are known to fail?
[20:15:38] <nesoi> coldhead : would you really have gone away forever if that technique hadn't been useful for me?
[20:15:48] <coldhead> i guess we'll never know
[20:16:03] <nesoi> guess not
[20:16:11] <coldhead> but it's fun to think about!
[20:16:18] <the8thbit> Thanks! Not reloading test.js worked!
[20:16:19] <coldhead> like imagine we were on a pink spaceship!
[20:16:21] <coldhead> CRAZ!
[20:16:35] <nesoi> ok, then I'll admit. I couldn'
[20:16:36] <capt_blackwood> http://www.alexandersdesigns.net/578-2/ <<< Any ideas as to why my tabs won't load?
[20:16:40] <nesoi> t figure out how to make that useful
[20:16:50] <nesoi> because both things are legitimately getting click events
[20:16:53] <nesoi> :)
[20:17:05] <nesoi> or rather, tap events
[20:17:06] <coldhead> oh right
[20:17:20] <coldhead> but MY point is you can test WHICH element was actually clicked in EACH of the relevant handlers
[20:17:25] <coldhead> and take appropriate action
[20:17:39] <coldhead> but i won't bore you with any more of my "theories"
[20:17:45] <coldhead> i am going to join Zak in that other place
[20:17:52] <nesoi> what's the other place?
[20:17:55] <nesoi> oh no!
[20:18:01] <nesoi> I should have kept my big 'mouth' shut
[20:20:03] <LocalPCGuy> capt_blackwood your page is killing my browser
[20:20:13] <capt_blackwood> how?
[20:20:31] <LocalPCGuy> just lots of stuff on it and non-responsive scripts
[20:20:39] <Zak> i was alone
[20:20:39] <b-ot> Zak: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[20:20:47] <Zak> it was terrible. coldhead hold me :(
[20:21:11] * Zak quickly writes some Javascript to settle himself
[20:21:23] <LocalPCGuy> JavaScript is settling?
[20:22:32] <capt_blackwood> Trying to figure out why the tabs aren't working
[20:24:13] <LocalPCGuy> probably something to do with the error in the console:
[20:24:13] <LocalPCGuy> Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function www.alexandersdesigns.net:83
[20:24:28] <LocalPCGuy> why are you using jQuery as jQ?
[20:24:33] <LocalPCGuy> just curious?
[20:24:36] <capt_blackwood> sorry?
[20:26:01] <LocalPCGuy> global.js - line 2 - var jq = jQuery;
[20:26:37] <capt_blackwood> I'm missing something.
[20:26:46] <LocalPCGuy> according to the error in the console, $ is undefined, so jQuery is probably running in no conflict mode or something like that
[20:27:06] <capt_blackwood> I don't remember having it set to that
[20:27:22] <LocalPCGuy> jq on the other hand, is jQuery (and equivalent to what we usually see as $ or just jQuery)
[20:27:55] <LocalPCGuy> I'd look through your code and the code of any frameworks/plugins you are using to see which one clobbered jQuery then
[20:28:18] <LocalPCGuy> once you fix that, I'm guessing your tabs will likely work assuming no other problems
[20:28:33] <LocalPCGuy> try disabling plugins one at a time maybe?
[20:30:13] <capt_blackwood> weird
[20:30:17] <LocalPCGuy> that give you a direction to look in?
[20:30:24] <capt_blackwood> I killed everything and still no tabs
[20:31:44] <LocalPCGuy> did you write global.js or scripts.js?
[20:31:50] <LocalPCGuy> or neither/both?
[20:32:04] <capt_blackwood> neither
[20:33:02] <LocalPCGuy> they are written in slightly different styles, I prefer the style shown in scripts.js where jquery is passed into an anonymous function over the way global.js assigns jquery to jq
[20:33:16] <capt_blackwood> where are you seeing these files?
[20:33:31] <LocalPCGuy> they are being loaded on the page you linked
[20:33:50] <capt_blackwood> how are you seeing them
[20:33:56] <LocalPCGuy> chrome inspector
[20:34:08] <capt_blackwood> i see
[20:34:29] <LocalPCGuy> Sources tab.  There is 95 requests total for 877KB - I've seen worse, but it could certainly be optimized
[20:34:57] <capt_blackwood> Heh
[20:35:03] <LocalPCGuy> easy fix is probably just changing the $ to jQuery
[20:35:06] <capt_blackwood> The site's due for a "From scratch build
[20:35:09] <LocalPCGuy> in your code snippet
[20:35:55] <capt_blackwood> where would I do that?
[20:36:29] <capt_blackwood> in my functions.php i've got wp_enqueue_script("jquery"); <<< That going
[20:37:56] <LocalPCGuy> about Google Chrome Developer tools: http://youtu.be/TH7sJbyXHuk
[20:38:27] <capt_blackwood> let me launch chrome here
[20:38:28] <tw2113> capt_blackwood, assuming the theme hasn't uregistered the WP core copy of jQuery, that will just load the WP core version
[20:38:59] <tw2113> which gets loaded in noConflict mode
[20:40:35] <LocalPCGuy> bah, WP, why?  Of all the things WP does, the wp_enqueue_script is one of my least favorite
[20:41:03] <capt_blackwood> still kinda lost as to what line needs to be wacked
[20:41:09] <LocalPCGuy> I mean, I get it, with the plugin architecture, but...there must be a better way (even in wordpress)
[20:41:13] <LocalPCGuy> sorry, just ranting
[20:41:34] <tw2113> capt_blackwood, whatever is doing this: var jq = jQuery;
[20:41:35] <LocalPCGuy> capt: did you write the tabs code on/around like 83 in the HTML file?
[20:41:39] <tw2113> apparently
[20:42:17] <LocalPCGuy> tw2113 whacking that line won't fix it though, that isn't killing the $
[20:42:31] <tw2113> something is somewhere
[20:42:39] <tw2113> and it's doing something
[20:42:42] <capt_blackwood> the tab function in on 184 over here
[20:42:47] <tw2113> that's all i know :D
[20:42:48] <LocalPCGuy> tw2113 guessing it is what you said about jQuery being loaded in noConflict, because noConflict doesn't provide the $ I don't believe
[20:43:10] <tw2113> pretty much
[20:43:29] <LocalPCGuy> capt: the lines that look like this:
[20:43:31] <tw2113> you either need to use 'jQuery' word directly or pass in the $ into the function to use inside it
[20:43:49] <LocalPCGuy> $(function() { $( "#pinball" ).tabs();
[20:43:49] <LocalPCGuy>  });
[20:43:59] <LocalPCGuy> $ will not work in that case
[20:44:19] <LocalPCGuy> either $, both must be replaced with jQuery
[20:44:54] <tw2113> jQuery(function($) { $('#pinball').tabs(); ...
[20:45:12] <LocalPCGuy> and seriously, go to youtube and watch some videos on using the developer tools in Chrome or on using Firebug.
[20:45:32] <tw2113> i think that any time i see someone using alert()
[20:45:47] <LocalPCGuy> could always just those lines: (function($){ ... existing code ... }(jQuery));
[20:45:55] <LocalPCGuy> yup
[20:47:27] <jrockjiggz2> jQuery( function($){ //use $ here });
[20:48:34] <jrockjiggz2> oh
[20:50:54] <LocalPCGuy> interesting, jQuery automatically enables the $ inside itself - kind of a duh and oh! moment at the same time
[20:51:40] <capt_blackwood> Its weird because on one of my subsite's its working fine
[20:51:47] <capt_blackwood> and I've got more crap there
[20:52:05] <andres__> is there anything wrong with this code http://jsfiddle.net/uTFJH/2/?
[20:52:08] <capt_blackwood> http://pegasus.alexandersdesigns.net/about-pegasus/ <<< Works fine
[20:52:14] <LocalPCGuy> have you tried just replacing the $ with jQuery?
[20:52:19] <LocalPCGuy> twice
[20:52:33] <capt_blackwood> yes
[20:52:41] <LocalPCGuy> and that fixes it?
[20:52:45] <capt_blackwood> nope
[20:53:11] <LocalPCGuy> you did it in the ready function and the tabs call?
[20:53:35] <capt_blackwood> i replaced the $ with jQuery in the call
[20:53:49] <LocalPCGuy> and around the call is a $(function...
[20:53:55] <LocalPCGuy> that $ needs to be replaced as well
[20:53:59] <LocalPCGuy> $ is undefined
[20:54:01] <capt_blackwood> i just did that
[20:54:02] <thinkerweb> frig this ui is a pain.  I am reading this: http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/ and it mentions this line which I tried but breaks my script: var active = $( ".selector" ).tabs( "option", "active" );

[20:54:09] <capt_blackwood> jQuery( "#pinball" ).tabs();

[20:54:41] <LocalPCGuy> jQuery(function() { jQuery( "#pinball" ).tabs();
[20:54:41] <LocalPCGuy> });
[20:54:43] <LocalPCGuy> like that
[20:55:59] <capt_blackwood> just did that
[20:56:53] <LocalPCGuy> if you did what you pasted, then I beg to differ
[20:57:14] <capt_blackwood> i did what you pasted
[20:57:25] <LocalPCGuy> and is it on that same URL now?

[20:59:07] <capt_blackwood> well that didn't work
[20:59:34] <LocalPCGuy> I see the exact same error in the exact same place
[20:59:43] <tw2113> caching plugin?
[20:59:46] <capt_blackwood> line 57
[20:59:51] <LocalPCGuy> Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function
[21:00:00] <LocalPCGuy> line 83 in chrome dev tools
[21:00:34] <thinkerweb> man...they changed ui a lot and the text I have is the old version. We don't have a "url" method anymore it seems
[21:00:48] <capt_blackwood> mine's calling for line 57 in chrome dev tools
[21:01:02] <tw2113> capt_blackwood, caching plugin?
[21:01:09] <capt_blackwood> turned it off
[21:01:16] <LocalPCGuy> I really dislike UI tabs - lots of overhead and stuff for something that can be done in quite a bit less JS
[21:01:21] <tw2113> deleted stored cache?
[21:01:37] <LocalPCGuy> and 9 times out of 10 you need to roll your own CSS styles anyways
[21:02:29] <capt_blackwood> cache for chrome emptied
[21:02:41] <LocalPCGuy> yah, line 57 on the new url
[21:02:54] <LocalPCGuy> the new url (pinball-tables) still shows you are using $ thought
[21:02:54] <tw2113> cache provided by the website
[21:02:55] <LocalPCGuy> -t
[21:03:12] <tw2113> wp super cache serves files from the server
[21:03:22] <tw2113> and everyone may still be gettin them
[21:03:27] <LocalPCGuy> likely
[21:03:30] <capt_blackwood> yeah
[21:03:35] <tw2113> did you delete those?
[21:05:11] <thinkerweb> I have a request, can we eliminate the need to quite selectors?
[21:05:26] <thinkerweb> ok, I've gone to far now
[21:05:31] <thinkerweb> too
[21:06:42] <capt_blackwood> THERE WE GO!
[21:06:45] <jrockjiggz> quite likely
[21:06:50] <jrockjiggz> ;0
[21:07:12] <capt_blackwood> bet that was half my problems earlier today
[21:07:28] <capt_blackwood> pop the refreshers kiddies!
[21:07:58] <LocalPCGuy> ideally you should go figure out where/why the jQuery $ isn't defined, but I'll understand if you don't
[21:08:05] <tw2113> old cache?
[21:08:06] <LocalPCGuy> want to do that
[21:08:13] <capt_blackwood> old cache
[21:08:19] <LocalPCGuy> that's why we were still seeing $...
[21:08:20] <capt_blackwood> Reload your pages
[21:08:24] <LocalPCGuy> yah, works now
[21:08:32] <tw2113> LocalPCGuy, noConflict ;)
[21:08:39] <capt_blackwood> i'm using $ on a simpler setup
[21:08:39] <LocalPCGuy> yah...ugh
[21:09:04] <capt_blackwood> http://pegasus.alexandersdesigns.net/about-pegasus <<<< Here
[21:09:10] <LocalPCGuy> I don't see a reason to use noConflict unless you are loading another library that also using $
[21:09:14] <capt_blackwood> A setup a little more complex, but works non the less
[21:11:02] <capt_blackwood> $(function() {
[21:11:03] <capt_blackwood>  $( "#accordion" ).accordion({
[21:11:03] <capt_blackwood> heightStyle: "content"
[21:11:03] <capt_blackwood> });
[21:11:03] <capt_blackwood> $( "#chartab" ).tabs();
[21:11:03] <capt_blackwood> $( "#shiptab" ).tabs();
[21:11:05] <capt_blackwood> $( "#techtab" ).tabs();
[21:11:07] <capt_blackwood> }); <<< Yet it worked there
[21:11:13] <capt_blackwood> crap i gotta start using pastebin
[21:11:38] <treeprogram> hi, is sessionStore() a jQuery function? How would you recommend I store data locally on the browser?
[21:11:41] <LocalPCGuy> jsfiddle
[21:11:56] <capt_blackwood> ^^ I gotta send that to my work compy
[21:12:09] <tw2113> treeprogram, it may be a js function, doesn't look to be a jQuery one
[21:12:36] <treeprogram> tw2113 thanks for the info, any comparable jQuery functions?
[21:12:46] <capt_blackwood> so $ isn't usually a good idea?
[21:12:54] <tw2113> why not just use the javascript version?
[21:13:04] <treeprogram> tw2113 that would be just too logical
[21:13:07] <tw2113> capt_blackwood, $ is just fine if you know how to get it working
[21:13:19] <LocalPCGuy> nothing wrong with $, just the way jQuery was loaded
[21:13:21] <capt_blackwood> maybe it was the theme setup on that site
[21:13:28] <LocalPCGuy> could be
[21:13:31] <tw2113> it has nothing to do with the theme
[21:13:40] <capt_blackwood> heh
[21:13:42] <LocalPCGuy> or not
[21:14:04] <capt_blackwood> Anyway, I'll probably redo the whole bloody site and one day just get it all right.
[21:14:28] <capt_blackwood> now i gotta match the theme and get the other tabs going
[21:14:30] <LocalPCGuy> I use WP when I have to, but generally strip all the jQuery loading stuff out right away and just add it to my footer include
[21:15:05] <capt_blackwood> My next version of my site's gonna be all custom
[21:15:18] <tw2113> capt_blackwood, http://easywebwiki.com/code/2011/10/resolve-the-conflict-of-jquery-with-other-javascript-libraries/
[21:15:28] <capt_blackwood> Probably may weigh less than what the current version weighs
[21:15:48] <capt_blackwood> adding links to delicious
[21:16:48] <LocalPCGuy> tw2113 is there really any good reason to use multiple libraries like that at the stage of the game?
[21:17:08] <tw2113> not that i know of
[21:17:11] <tw2113> but people are people
[21:17:16] <LocalPCGuy> I suppose in transitional phases :shrug:
[21:17:23] <LocalPCGuy> heh, good answer
[21:17:29] <capt_blackwood> Here's what I don't like.
[21:17:29] <tw2113> lord knows people are stupid sometimes
[21:17:43] <thinkerweb> Anyone can show me syntax for using load() method for tabs.  It doesn't show it in docs" http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/
[21:17:44] <coldhead> and how
[21:17:44] <capt_blackwood> All the plugins call up their own version of jQuery
[21:17:54] <thinkerweb> I wanna load tab content via ajax
[21:18:00] <capt_blackwood> WHY THE FRAK can't they all call up the same bloody version
[21:18:04] <capt_blackwood> seriously.
[21:18:18] <tw2113> a question that has no answer capt_blackwood
[21:18:32] <capt_blackwood> bet i can make a good guess tho
[21:18:43] <thinkerweb> capsz, what plugins, the ones from jquery site.  I bet most work with the latest version anyway
[21:18:47] <tw2113> i can answer many reasons why they won't
[21:18:57] <tw2113> thinkerweb, he's talking WordPress plugins
[21:19:06] <LocalPCGuy> love this quote: Never commit to memory what can be easily looked up in books - Albert Einstein.
[21:19:16] <LocalPCGuy> random Einstein quote of the day
[21:19:18] <thinkerweb> Oh, wordpress is cool, I gotta learn to use it one day
[21:19:21] <Zak> `read
[21:19:21] <b-ot> Zak: From coldhead, 1h 25m ago: i will never ever forget you
[21:19:26] <Zak> hahah
[21:19:32] <Zak> <3
[21:19:33] <capt_blackwood> Been using wordpress for a year
[21:19:34] <capt_blackwood> love it
[21:19:47] <LocalPCGuy> bah...use it a bit longer
[21:19:59] <thinkerweb> I am thinking using ui pigeon holes your design experience while not providing enough advantage, better just use plugins
[21:20:00] <LocalPCGuy> you'll soon feel the despise creeping in
[21:20:26] <thinkerweb> Unless you use a lot of the widgets, its not worth learning how to work with em.
[21:20:36] <thinkerweb> ui is so hard to custom style
[21:20:37] <tw2113> for personal stuff, if you hate WP so much, don't use it
[21:20:41] <andres__> does anybody know why im not able to see the google map api with the correct height and width i have set in my div? is it necessary to change something in the settings?
[21:20:41] <capt_blackwood> I'm more of a "mess with the code"
[21:20:42] <tw2113> if it's going to be the best solution for a client
[21:20:44] <tw2113> go with it
[21:20:59] <capt_blackwood> That pegasus subsite is my first custom theme. Crappy and basic. But it works
[21:21:00] <LocalPCGuy> yah, I agree - and use it for my own site even (for now)
[21:21:06] <thinkerweb> wordpress has awesome responsive designs, they gonna take over a lot of the webs
[21:21:22] <capt_blackwood> Personally Wordpress > Joomla
[21:22:00] <LocalPCGuy> WP is great for quick development
[21:22:04] <thinkerweb> I believe in two design paradigm.  Why is it important for desktop and mobile site to be exactly same, design for mobile and design for desktop separately
[21:22:31] * capt_blackwood facedesks
[21:22:40] <thinkerweb> I am exploying ui and mobile for now
[21:22:43] <capt_blackwood> keep forgetting to do the mobile version of this site
[21:23:57] <thinkerweb> I am finding mobile to much more useful than ui, but then I never really made an app for desktop, but what little I did play with ui was frustrating, its hard to style, cause they styles in their were not written by you, so you are in the dark
[21:24:27] <thinkerweb> jquery site is wordpress
[21:24:29] <LocalPCGuy> there is always the no-style
[21:24:45] <LocalPCGuy> wordpress is winning the interwebs
[21:24:50] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, no, the ui relies on the styles, without the styles the ui breaks
[21:25:04] <LocalPCGuy> thinkerweb nah, you can roll your own styles
[21:25:15] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, yeah, thats not what I said
[21:26:00] <LocalPCGuy> thinkerweb with UI, you can completely ditch their stylesheet (they even offer a no-style option in the builder, I believe) and just write it specifically the way you want
[21:26:20] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, did you ever try it?
[21:26:21] <LocalPCGuy> that way you aren't dealing with their styles at all
[21:26:39] <LocalPCGuy> thinkerweb yup, number of times, and fellow workmates do the same
[21:26:43] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, try it yourself and then talk
[21:27:08] <LocalPCGuy> thinkerweb I do - none of the stuff I've used UI for could use their styles - all had to be custom
[21:27:32] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, you don't really know what I am talking about. Like, I tried to make three divs inside a tab, and it was hard to style, or I tried to position one of the ui icons in the top right corner and I couldn't do it
[21:28:05] <thinkerweb> If you just use it as it, is great
[21:28:30] <LocalPCGuy> thinkerweb yah - that's why I was saying to not use their styles, because you then are stuck overriding and working around them
[21:28:40] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, ok forget it
[21:28:47] <LocalPCGuy> :shrug:
[21:30:02] <capt_blackwood> Thank you very much for your help and patience tonight
[21:31:21] <thinkerweb> anyone can teach me how to load content via ajax into ui .tabs() using the load method or option
[21:31:55] <thinkerweb> http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#method-load doesn't really show anything
[21:34:06] <thinkerweb> oh there is another docs sections: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Tabs woohoo
[21:37:33] <capt_blackwood> *goes to look at the functions.php s of his themes
[21:38:38] <thinkerweb> oh cool, you don't have to do anything special, just use href=""
[21:39:47] <thinkerweb> doesn't work if I change the href'd file to php though, even if I change it to echo too
[21:40:27] <thinkerweb> wait yeah it does
[21:50:08] <WillPittenger> Can someone point me to a tutorial?  I've done some Javascript, but mostly other languages.
[21:51:19] <tw2113> to do what WillPittenger ?
[21:52:04] <coldhead> http://www.wikihow.com/Peel-a-Banana
[21:52:31] <WillPittenger> Well, I'm told we need some charts.  I don't know if we will be using a specific API built on JQuery or not.  All I know is he talked about JQuery.  So I've been reading up on it.
[21:52:55] <T-Co> WillPittenger, Take a look at Highcharts
[21:53:01] <coldhead> http://www.flotcharts.org/
[21:53:08] <coldhead> highcharts is hella comblex
[21:53:23] <coldhead> it's like Math.sqrt(-1_
[21:53:30] <T-Co> If you happen to need complex charts?
[21:57:03] * WillPittenger is off to dinner.
[21:58:38] <thinkerweb> How do you place a jquery ui icon beside the txt of the tab label for jquery ui .tabs()?
[21:59:39] <coldhead> good chatting to you WillPittenger
[22:00:36] <thinkerweb> How the heck can you put icons inside the tab button of ui .tabs()?
[22:00:49] <LocalPCGuy> just add <i class="ui-icon ui-icon-ICONNAME" style="display:inline-block"></i> to your tab a tag
[22:00:56] <LocalPCGuy> and then style it how/where you want it
[22:01:47] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, yep, that worked
[22:01:52] <LocalPCGuy> cool
[22:01:57] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, what is this <i> element?
[22:02:02] <LocalPCGuy> old italic
[22:02:19] <LocalPCGuy> no one really uses it for that anymore, saves a few bytes instead of using a span element
[22:02:48] <LocalPCGuy> <i>this text would be italic</i>
[22:03:03] <LocalPCGuy> bad way of using it :P
[22:03:41] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, I'll just leave it as span I guess
[22:03:46] <LocalPCGuy> that works
[22:04:11] <LocalPCGuy> twiter bootstrap kinda started the <i> for elements idea, as far as I know
[22:04:14] <tw2113> i think it got new semantic meaning in the latest html spec anyway
[22:04:18] <LocalPCGuy> true
[22:04:38] <tw2113> "The i element represents a span of text in an alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from the normal prose in a manner indicating a different quality of text, such as a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic phrase or short span of transliterated prose from another language, a thought, or a ship name in Western texts."
[22:04:48] <LocalPCGuy> yah, that
[22:04:51] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, how did you know to use inline-block, my first instinct was to use float:left or right
[22:04:57] <coldhead> <i> now stands for "imagine" as in "imagine what this might mean semantically"
[22:05:10] <LocalPCGuy> hahaha
[22:05:49] <LocalPCGuy> thinkerweb float would work, but then you need to clearfix the containing a, etc...just gets messy.  inline block is nice for icons and stuff like that
[22:05:50] <sacrilicious> i cannot join ##php, it says #php Cannot join channel (+i) - you must be invited
[22:05:57] <sacrilicious> what does that even mean ?
[22:06:10] <T-Co> In IRC we have this thing called invite
[22:06:10] <tw2113> sacrilicious, you have to have your nickname registered and identified with nickserv
[22:06:21] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, my css skills are weak
[22:06:21] <sacrilicious> i already did that
[22:06:35] <thinkerweb> LocalPCGuy, clearfix?
[22:06:41] <tw2113> type /ns id yourpassword
[22:06:58] <tw2113> sacrilicious,
[22:07:06] <thinkerweb> This nicorette give me hickups
[22:07:15] <tw2113> and replace yourpassword with the actual password you chose when you registered your nic
[22:07:25] <LocalPCGuy> thinkerweb http://nicolasgallagher.com/micro-clearfix-hack/
[22:07:27] <tw2113> ?g clearfix css
[22:07:28] <b-ot> tw2113: CSS clearfix → http://www.webtoolkit.info/css-clearfix.html
[22:07:44] <LocalPCGuy> not 100% sure but I think that is the one used in HTML5Boilerplate
[22:07:51] <LocalPCGuy> or a variation of it
[22:08:00] <coldhead> thinkerweb: yeah nicotine hiccups are a thing, it's weird
[22:08:37] <LocalPCGuy> bo-t's googlefu appears weak
[22:08:43] <tw2113> would you rather smell like smoke? or hickup?
[22:09:15] <thinkerweb> oh I'd rather smoke
[22:09:20] <thinkerweb> I just aint got none
[22:09:20] <coldhead> hiccups can be very erotic
[22:09:30] * tw2113 backs away slowly
[22:09:44] <thinkerweb> smell, I don't even bother wearing pants most of time, I am a bachelor
[22:10:34] <thinkerweb> Wish they never invented cigs
[22:10:52] <coldhead> thinkerweb: have you considered swedish snus?
[22:10:58] <sacrilicious> how did the conversation changed from clearfix to not wearing pants ?
[22:11:04] <coldhead> all the thrill of nicotine with none of the stink
[22:11:06] <thinkerweb> snus?
[22:11:08] <tw2113> karma's a bitch
[22:11:17] <coldhead> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus
[22:11:23] <thinkerweb> I dont care so much about the stink as I do the cancer
[22:11:46] <coldhead> it's supposed to be less cancerous
[22:11:53] <coldhead> according to the world health organisation
[22:12:07] <coldhead> but i do feel dirty schilling for tobacco
[22:12:14] <thinkerweb> oh, I know of snuss
[22:12:15] <coldhead> don't do drugs and stay in school
[22:12:22] <thinkerweb> I like the act of smoking
[22:15:00] <thinkerweb> I wish there was something else I could smoke besides tobacco, cause I think I like the act more than the nicoteen.
[22:15:22] <LocalPCGuy> pretty sure there are other things you can smoke...
[22:15:41] <LocalPCGuy> may not be 100% legal, depending on your location...
[22:15:42] <thinkerweb> yeah but tobacco doesn't really get you intoxicated
[22:15:42] <LocalPCGuy> :P
[22:15:55] <LocalPCGuy> true
[22:16:12] <thinkerweb> there is a buzz, but it doesn't affect inhibit your ability to function
[22:17:03] <axebox> artists smoke saliva
[22:17:14] <axebox> *sativa
[22:17:29] <thinkerweb> frig, how much is a pack of nicorette in canada
[22:17:47] <thinkerweb> I am taking two 2mg chicklettes
[22:17:59] <thinkerweb> but I only got ten left
[22:18:33] <thinkerweb> this is better than burning my lungs, no more spitting up hoark
[22:18:56] <tw2113> how about that $
[22:19:25] <LocalPCGuy> I thought it was jq now
[22:19:50] <LocalPCGuy> anyone going to be at the Toronto conference this weekend?
[22:19:57] <thinkerweb> frig $50 / pack
[22:20:28] <sacrilicious> http://www.businessinsider.com/lost-continent-found-under-indian-ocean-2013-2 i am proud
[22:25:53] <thinkerweb> sacrilicious, your are from Mauritus?
[22:25:59] <thinkerweb> why are you proud
[22:36:29] <axebox> $.Deferred() is quite a beast.
[22:38:48] <T-Co> Bacon.JS is more like so
[22:39:14] <T-Co> https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js
[22:41:15] <thinkerweb> frig man...my android device doesn't support these awesome page swipes.  That is second greatest mobile optiomization feature you can offer, number 1 is tel: links
[22:58:08] <veQue> i'm trying to a simple total and i think my '' and NaNs are getting in the way
[22:58:35] <veQue> just covert all NaNs and ''s to 0 ?
[23:00:35] <Ziggy`> veQue: Parse it ?
[23:00:51] <veQue> ziggy i call myself parsing
[23:00:59] <veQue> i'll doublecheck
[23:01:44] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/XFN76/
[23:02:09] <Ziggy`> veQue: var foo = parseInt(NaN) || 0;
[23:02:20] <Ziggy`> veQue: var foo = parseInt(bar) || 0;
[23:02:37] <Cork> Ziggy`: never use parseInt(value)
[23:02:40] <Cork> its unsafe
[23:02:48] <Cork> user parseInt(value, 10)
[23:03:02] <Cork> else you might octet parse the number
[23:03:41] <veQue> so Cork what's the best way of getting a total of t3 = 7 in my example?
[23:03:56] <Ziggy`> veQue: var foo = parseInt(bar, 10) || 0;
[23:04:09] <veQue> oh bar is an actual keyword?
[23:04:20] <Ziggy`> Depends what you pass in as second argument.
[23:04:22] <veQue> ok i'll try thanks
[23:04:26] <Ziggy`> What kind of numbers are you working with?
[23:04:35] <Ziggy`> the second parameter is the radix.
[23:04:57] <veQue> decimals or floats
[23:05:44] <Cork> then you need parseFloat
[23:06:37] <veQue> oh ok i got it now i misunderstood cork's tip
[23:08:35] <Ziggy`> veQue: Yeah, I was unsure, just use number = parseFloat(number, 10) || 0;
[23:08:48] <Cork> heh nope, no , 10 ;)
[23:09:06] <Cork> you can't have a radix on floats :)
[23:09:18] <Cork> those are always 10 based
[23:10:27] <r1card> does the animation API in jquery support initial delay somehow? I can't find it.
[23:10:29] <Ziggy`> Yeah, that's right, parseFloat only accepts decimals, second parameter will do nothing :P
[23:11:05] <Cork> r1card: if its initial delay from another animation theres delay()
[23:11:23] <Cork> r1card: if its a delay before the first one, no you need to use setTimeout
[23:11:29] <r1card> Cork, I'll check it out, thanks.
[23:11:51] <r1card> Cork, I'm currently using setTimeout but I'm baffled by how inaccurate it is on WebKit browsers (at least, from what I tested so far)
[23:12:01] <r1card> It's off by 50-100 msec at times.
[23:12:30] <Cork> r1card: animation will be just as inaccurate
[23:12:43] <Cork> it uses the same time mechanism
[23:13:06] <r1card> Cork, well it animates with over 20 fps, so it surely isn't off by 50-100 msec
[23:13:10] <Cork> timers triggers "as soon as possible after"
[23:13:32] <Cork> the same is true for animate
[23:13:56] <Cork> ex. if your code takes a little while to execute, that will block the timer from running
[23:14:11] <Cork> (the code in your function after you start the setTimeout)
[23:14:18] <r1card> Cork, yes but I have no such slow code.
[23:14:37] <Cork> could you show a testcase where you get that timer problem then?
[23:15:36] <Cork> cause to my experience timers should be fairly accurate as long as: 1. the page has focus, 2. js isn't doing a lot of other things, 3. the computers isn't under load
[23:16:01] <Cork> just to make sure; remember that js is single threaded
[23:16:12] <Cork> and includes, timers and all events
[23:16:27] <r1card> Cork, well JS is kinda doing something: it's doing animations (via jquery) so that's my only theory as to why the timers are inaccurate. But animation is a fairly granular task. Many small tasks, no blocking.
[23:16:51] <r1card> I need to start three animations one after another, I have this: http://pastebin.com/MgExyJSt
[23:16:55] <r1card> Cork ^
[23:17:06] <r1card> So it's simple like this, but it's very rough looking at times.
[23:17:11] <r1card> It doesn't launch on time.
[23:17:13] <Cork> r1card: you can't use timers reliably for that
[23:17:23] <r1card> Cork, please give advice how to do it.
[23:18:20] <Cork> its a bit tough with jquery, cause the old slideshow groups pushed hard to remove the code that made it possible
[23:18:32] <r1card> :(
[23:18:44] <Cork> requestAnimationFrame
[23:18:45] <r1card> Who are those "old slideshow groups"?
[23:19:04] <Cork> r1card: google jquery slideshow plugin
[23:19:21] <Cork> all of those are doing things that will break if the page doesn't have focus
[23:19:40] <Cork> and break even worse if jquery used requestAnimationFrame
[23:20:30] <Cork> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8101
[23:20:33] <Cork> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9381
[23:20:35] <Cork> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/please-don-t-remove-requestanimationframe
[23:21:20] <r1card> Cork, so jquery is not using requestanimationframe right now at all?
[23:21:28] <Cork> nope
[23:21:33] <r1card> Ugh.
[23:21:42] <r1card> I thought that was the way forward.
[23:21:46] <Cork> r1card: the safe way to do it is to grab a datestamp, then use requestAnimationFrame and then check in each itteration for when to start the next animation
[23:21:52] <Cork> it is
[23:22:08] <Cork> and thats why http://forum.jquery.com/topic/please-don-t-remove-requestanimationframe was posted
[23:22:31] <Cork> but slideshows want to use setInterval and loop for ever (even if the computer is trying to go into sleep mode)
[23:22:47] <Cork> and breaks horribly if jquery uses requestAnimationFrame
[23:23:05] <Cork> and the writers of those plugins is to lazy to fix it properly
[23:23:24] <Cork> so the rest of the world has to stay back in 1997
[23:23:31] <r1card> :(
[23:24:25] <Cork> its one of my biggest disappointments with jquery actually
[23:26:54] <r1card> Cork, what's the current status of this?
[23:27:05] <Cork> backedout
[23:27:12] <Cork> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9381 <--
[23:27:22] <tw2113> fork the code and fix it for your own resources
[23:27:36] <r1card> Cork, but this is over a year ago
[23:27:40] <Cork> there is a patch in the first issue, you can try to apply it to jquery
[23:27:45] <Cork> r1card: so?
[23:27:52] <Cork> the slideshows plugins won't change
[23:27:57] <r1card> Cork, no development at all?
[23:28:03] <Cork> development of what?
[23:28:05] <tw2113> no dev from the original authors
[23:28:07] <r1card> Cork, this is worse than commercial software.
[23:28:08] <Cork> the code was already written
[23:28:39] <Cork> and then backed out cause slideshow authors didn't know how to do propper animations
[23:29:00] <r1card> Cork, ok I have a solution how to use RAF and appease slideshow authors, let's push for it.
[23:29:09] <r1card> :)
[23:29:29] <r1card> Wanna know?
[23:29:35] <Cork> go for it :)
[23:30:02] <r1card> I thought this is one of your biggest issues with jquery.
[23:30:15] <r1card> Any of us can patch things for themselves, that's easy.
[23:30:20] <r1card> But it's not useful for the community.
[23:30:25] <Cork> true
[23:30:28] <tw2113> welcome to open source
[23:30:34] <r1card> I have a solution, you have familiarity, let's do it. :)
[23:30:40] <tw2113> you have no control over original devs laziness
[23:31:06] <r1card> The solution is to use RAF and use a low-frequency secondary timer to update things so they don't lag significantly in the background.
[23:31:06] <Cork> tw2113: the problem isn't original devs, its third party devs
[23:31:17] <tw2113> you have even less control over them
[23:31:21] <r1card> For example: RAF + a timer once per two seconds.
[23:31:30] <Cork> r1card: doesn't work
[23:31:33] <r1card> Cork, why?
[23:31:41] <tw2113> provide a fixed, better version and market it
[23:31:49] <Cork> the problem is setTimeout/setInterval triggers when the browser wants to draw
[23:31:56] <Cork> thats the point
[23:32:01] <r1card> tw2113, create a new planet and evolve new sentient beings on it.
[23:32:01] <tw2113> hack the 3rd party devs websites that provide a plugin, and replace with a better version :D
[23:32:11] <Cork> ug sorry
[23:32:21] <Cork> that became totally wrong
[23:32:38] <Cork> the problem is ARF triggers when the browser wants to draw, thats the point
[23:32:51] <r1card> Cork, well timers work in bg, frames don't, right? So my solutions solves this.
[23:32:56] <Cork> so if you add new animations from a constantly triggering setTimeout/setInterval
[23:33:00] <Cork> you will build a queue
[23:33:19] <Cork> r1card: its apples and oranges
[23:33:35] <r1card> Cork, it's not apples and oranges. Maybe I'm not explaining well.
[23:33:48] <r1card> Cork, RAF is not used for timing it's merely a trigger, correct?
[23:34:02] <Cork> kinda ya
[23:34:16] <r1card> I propose the sale for the Low Frequency Timer (LFT). The LFT will be a background trigger to process the queue, nothing more.
[23:34:23] <r1card> sale...?
[23:34:32] <r1card> ehehe, I mean "same"
[23:34:58] <Cork> r1card: but then you would lose the point of RAF == if its not visible, don't do the work
[23:35:32] <r1card> Cork, I won't. the LFT will trigger once per 2 seconds and the work will be minimal. RAF triggers up to 60 times a second when the window is active.
[23:36:08] <Cork> r1card: that would do the same problem
[23:36:14] <r1card> Flash does the same in newer releases, when in background it runs at veeeeery low FPS, doesn't freeze completely, or a queue piles up and it might crash
[23:36:25] <r1card> Cork, what same problem?
[23:36:35] <r1card> It's almost as if you prefer there to be no solution ;)
[23:36:38] <Cork> ex: setInterval(function() { $().animate({ left: '+1' }) }, 100);
[23:36:47] <r1card> What is that?
[23:36:52] <Cork> if you don't every 100 ms do that action, the animation will fail
[23:37:02] <Cork> thats a short example of what slideshows do
[23:37:34] <r1card> How would it fail? It'll just pile up and execute once per two seconds.
[23:38:02] <Cork> ah, you mean it would process all the queued elements
[23:38:13] <Cork> well, ya, that would kinda work
[23:38:29] <r1card> Yup. But since it executes them in one step no actual animation takes place, it just finalizes everything in the queue (last frame)
[23:38:37] <r1card> So it'll be low CPU activity
[23:38:58] <r1card> Better than the current model in every way.
[23:39:04] <r1card> Lower CPU, smoother animation
[23:39:04] <Cork> except it would still 1. prevent the computer from going into sleep mode, 2. still do quite a lot of work when a tab is in the background, 3. and the load would come in large batches that might make the experience even worse on other pages
[23:39:28] <Cork> not really, cause now the load comes is small batches
[23:39:47] <r1card> Sigh, look, here's how it is.
[23:40:03] <r1card> The load is created by recomputing and re-rendering the DOM every frame.
[23:40:20] <r1card> If you run one frame per 2 seconds, you recompute that once, even if there are more changes.
[23:40:22] <irnux> could someone please introduce me some slider plugin for very basic usage?
[23:40:36] <r1card> So on a high level the queue is piling up but on a lower level is one frame.
[23:40:39] <Cork> r1card: no you recompute the dom for every queue itteration
[23:40:48] <Cork> and then no rerendering cause the page isn't visible
[23:41:02] <r1card> Cork, right, so now you're contradicting yourself.
[23:41:05] <Cork> actually recompute for every time you update style on a dom element
[23:41:11] <r1card> See, this is why FOSS doesn't work well.
[23:41:23] <r1card> Why are you trying to misunderstand my solution instead of trying to understand it.
[23:41:34] <Cork> r1card: 1. a timer triggers a new queue every 10 ms (just to say)
[23:41:56] <Cork> 2. and the animation is set to unqueue that every 4ms interval (smallest possible timer)
[23:42:06] <Cork> then you get a 1:1 workload more or less
[23:42:17] <Cork> if you then replace that with a 2000 ms timer
[23:42:40] <Cork> you will have 200 queues to process one at a time, with modifications on one dom element at a time
[23:43:00] <Cork> if each change takes 2ms, thats a hang of 400ms
[23:43:19] <Cork> and would cause a yank in any other animation
[23:43:31] <r1card> I like how you're pulling numbers out of nowhere.
[23:43:42] <r1card> Which are completely unrealistic.
[23:43:44] <r1card> But ok, I get it.
[23:43:52] <r1card> You prefer to have the problem and complain about it.
[23:43:57] <Cork> i used small itterations just to make is visible
[23:43:59] <r1card> Se  be it.
[23:44:01] <r1card> So*
[23:44:08] <Cork> no i don't
[23:44:14] <r1card> There's a saying:
[23:44:20] <Cork> i just want to make it clear that you get problems in other places instead
[23:44:34] <r1card> "Engineering is done with real numbers. Engineering with no real numbers is not engineering, but at best an opinion."
[23:44:44] <r1card> So you opinion is that we're all doomed.
[23:45:05] <r1card> My experience is this worked for Flash (as crappy as it may be otherwise) and for many other similar systems.
[23:45:26] <r1card> And the current code in jQuery is apparently worse.
[23:45:36] <r1card> So do you like it worse, or you like it better. I'm wondering.
[23:45:52] <Cork> r1card: i would suspect that is has more threding support in that cause
[23:46:04] <r1card> No it's single threaded.
[23:46:15] <Cork> interesting
[23:46:48] <Cork> might be a different in the cost o reflow in dom then
[23:46:54] <r1card> They added a multi-threaded rendered in Flash 8, but that's not connected to the interpreter, event loops, and so on.
[23:47:01] <r1card> The script, frame and so on = one thread.
[23:47:25] <r1card> The cost to reflow DOM is not 2ms per element as your example said.
[23:47:33] <Cork> r1card: in case you didn't know the large cost of modifying the dom is not js, and not really rendering, its reflow
[23:47:41] <r1card> If it was, the average page would hang your browser for 30 sec as you scroll.
[23:47:48] <Cork> r1card: no i never said 2ms per ELEMENT
[23:47:52] <Cork> 2ms pre queue
[23:48:04] <Cork> a queue can do much more then just modify one element
[23:48:26] <Cork> pre==per
[23:48:29] <r1card> So tell me, when jQuery used RAF and you focused a tab, did it freeze for several seconds?
[23:49:19] <r1card> Anyway, screw it.
[23:49:25] <Cork> you got a burst of activety on the page, while it was not responsive yes
[23:49:26] <amirite> screw it
[23:49:30] <r1card> Looks like I'll patch it for myself. FOSS is a disaster.
[23:49:35] <r1card> Bye.
[23:50:15] <amirite> foss or floss
[23:50:19] <amirite> what's foss
[23:50:23] <amirite> is it like fout
[23:52:12] <r1card> Cork, I'll just tell you that in real engineering there's no such thing as a silver bullet solution. "All or nothing" usually leads to "nothing". If I told you "let's flush the queue once or twice a second instead of 50 times a second" this is still a reduction of CPU of over 25 times, and you're simply dismissing it, because it's not silvery bullety enough for you.
[23:55:04] <Cork> r1card: no i'm dismissing it cause i've followed animation problems in browsers, and that kind of patching isn't fun
[23:55:20] <Cork> patching==batching
[23:57:21] <r1card> Cork, if you have 100 queues that execute in 1000ms, at 50 fps, that's about 5000 element modifications per second with 50 document reflows per second. By flushing them once a second it's 100 element modifications with one document reflow per second. If you have a solution that's more fun, ok.
