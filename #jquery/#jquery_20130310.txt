[00:48:06] <skope> f*ck logic. yesterday everything worked when i went to bed, and now even click() doesn't work
[00:50:22] <kojul> don't take it out on poor click()
[00:50:56] <skope> something is greatly wrong. some lines work and some lines don't
[00:51:28] <greg5green> what's your console say?
[00:51:39] <skope> nothing
[00:51:53] <skope> eh. nevermind
[00:51:55] <skope> :p
[00:55:10] <skope> weird. i have https://gist.github.com/skopetsi/54b0dd2ff24a20db4389 outside of the $(function() { } and inside it i have $(selector).center() and firebugs console says that $(...).center is not a function. it didn't say it yesterday?
[00:56:10] <skope> that's because i deleted one of my plugins yesterday when cleaning code. maybe i'll just shut up before i make a total tool of myself
[00:56:29] <tw2113> but then who would entertain us?
[00:57:04] <skope> yeah
[00:57:32] <tw2113> here we are now!
[00:58:23] <skope> makes me sad
[00:58:29] <tw2113> why
[00:59:03] <skope> dunno. haven't had my morning coffee yet
[00:59:07] <skope> so i run slow
[00:59:19] <tw2113> morning coffee does solve a lot
[00:59:27] <tw2113> but not sure that's something to be sad over
[01:00:06] <enerel> hi all
[01:00:21] <skope> i beg to differ, i am sad if i don't get coffee
[01:00:42] <enerel> jQuery UI and Bootstrap has a conflict, any one have come across same issue?
[01:01:06] <tw2113> it helps to actually state the conflict
[01:01:39] <enerel> sorry i do not get it
[01:01:48] <tw2113> what is the conflict
[01:01:49] <enerel> what do you mean
[01:02:01] <tw2113> you're asking your question like "i have a problem, how can i fix it?"
[01:02:05] <enerel> i wanted to use bootstrap modal on UI page
[01:02:23] <tw2113> and i think you should be able to
[01:02:24] <enerel> i have a test link
[01:02:30] <tw2113> but without actually seeing what the conflict is
[01:02:34] <tw2113> no one can help resolve it
[01:02:43] <enerel> kefelon.com/upload/
[01:03:13] <enerel> if you lick in LOGIN, or modal demo button it darkens but the modal does not appear
[01:04:07] <tw2113> i see at least 4 different js errors in my console output
[01:04:17] <enerel> what are they?
[01:04:23] <enerel> in firebug i do not see any
[01:04:36] <tw2113> b.browser is undefined
[01:04:43] <tw2113> $(...).tabs is not a function
[01:04:51] <tw2113> $container.isotope is not a function
[01:04:57] <tw2113> $(...).nivoSlider is not a function
[01:05:25] <enerel> what program you use?
[01:05:32] <tw2113> firefox and firebug in this case
[01:05:33] <enerel> or plugin?
[01:05:53] <tw2113> open up firebug, click the console tab, then refresh the page
[01:06:36] <enerel> okay sorry
[01:06:52] <enerel> that was i was editing html
[01:06:56] <enerel> can you try now
[01:07:15] <enerel> top LOGIN button should open MODAL
[01:07:20] <tw2113> 404 Not Found - http://kefelon.com/upload/assets/layerslider-2.0/layerslider/skins/789theme/skin.css"
[01:09:48] <enerel> tw2113: please try now
[01:09:58] <tw2113> best i can tell, the parts that are supposed to unhide the popup stuff aren't working
[01:10:10] <tw2113> but with inspect element, i found them in the markup
[01:11:15] <tw2113>  404 Not Found - http://kefelon.com/upload/assets/layerslider-2.0/layerslider/skins/789theme/skin.css"
[01:11:24] <tw2113> oops, same error

[01:12:15] <tw2113> dunno quite whats up, and it's time for me to finally head to bed
[01:12:30] <tw2113> hopefully someone else can get you on the right path
[01:13:33] <enerel> okay
[01:13:43] <enerel> anyone?
[01:32:37] <gf3> Bleeding from the tips of the fingers is the absolute worst thing I can imagine
[01:34:59] <greg5green> i think getting the last 3rd of your fingers chopped off would be worse
[01:35:08] <greg5green> because those stubs would taunt you forever
[01:35:32] <greg5green> "ytou think you have the motor skills to operate this shit, hahahahhahaha)
[01:35:42] <greg5green> god, i am awful at " vs ) apparently
[01:40:50] <kojul> you sure you can't just blame it on your 2/3rd fingers?
[01:48:17] <greg5green> i will right now.
[01:48:29] <greg5green> those weird typos were entirely 2/3 stub related.
[01:56:47] <gf3> But seriously, I'd rather have no fingertips than constantly-bleeding-broken-nail-fingertips
[01:56:57] <gf3> Scratching things
[01:57:01] <gf3> UGH SO TERRIBLE

[03:54:05] <mboro> in qunit, is there any way to wait a test to complete before proceeding? asyncText isn't quite it
[03:55:32] <mboro> wait for a*
[04:01:55] <bluesm> Every browser have slightly different DOM inteface
[04:02:04] <bluesm> *interface ?
[04:56:32] <bluesm> Using the $("#something").find("li");  instead of $("#something li")
[04:56:38] <bluesm> is only for performance issued ?
[04:57:20] <bluesm> Because jquery function will have less "string analyzing" ?
[05:04:23] <silv3r_m00n> hi there
[05:04:41] <silv3r_m00n> I am making an ajax get call and its failing, but the same url opens fine in a new tab
[05:05:37] <silv3r_m00n> it fails in google chrome, but works in firefox, what could be the reason ?
[05:12:08] <gotwig> .css helps me to get/set a css property . How can I get all css properties of a tag?
[05:26:11] <gotwig> I want to get all css attributes, that were set with .css() once before
[05:26:16] <gotwig> any idea?
[05:38:35] <Guest36538> Hi guys. Hope somebody heard something about this problem. One of my client send me a report from his firewall, which is says that jquery.js v1.4.4 is suspicious. I'm using drupal 7 and never faced with this problem. Because of this report I cannot move with contract signing, so I really would be appriciated for any help!
[06:08:07] <StephenS> Why does ajax sometimes work sometimes dont?
[06:21:45] <aMoniker> StephenS: Internet.
[06:21:58] <StephenS> ?
[06:22:18] <aMoniker> Well, a connection failure could preven AJAX from working.
[06:22:22] <aMoniker> But your question is pretty vague
[06:22:55] <StephenS> my net is up and I follow networking from chrome
[06:23:01] <StephenS> sometimes it updates, sometimes not
[06:23:16] <aMoniker> do you see the request on your server?
[06:23:25] <StephenS> but when its not, I see ajax call on the end, and then image loaded, but that should not stop it if I use setinterval
[06:23:34] <StephenS> yes
[06:23:36] <StephenS> $.get()
[06:23:54] <StephenS> ah no
[06:23:57] <StephenS> I see no request
[06:24:24] <StephenS> as I said ,I see it sometimes. and when its requested all is good and updating, however I see no request sometimes
[06:24:25] <StephenS> dont know why
[06:25:07] <StephenS> here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/HN9ed/
[06:25:16] <StephenS> maybe there is a better way, or doing with post or something?
[06:25:55] <StephenS> aMoniker, ?
[06:27:05] <aMoniker> urg.. everytime updateChat() runs, it sets an additional setInterval for itself
[06:27:11] <aMoniker> that could have something to do with it
[06:27:34] <StephenS> can you re-edit it with your own idea?
[06:27:40] <aMoniker> change it to setTimeout
[06:28:04] <StephenS> it was seted to timeout before
[06:28:12] <StephenS> I thought that was tehe problem, but it didnt helped
[06:28:22] <StephenS> is it possible that maybe my code is somehow conflicted with something?
[06:28:25] <StephenS> in console I see no error
[06:29:16] <StephenS> befoer it was     window.setTimeout("updateChat();", 10000);
[06:30:30] <aMoniker> ok, if it's setTimeout then your js looks ok
[06:30:36] <aMoniker> what happens on the php side?
[06:31:15] <StephenS> just output info requested
[06:31:25] <StephenS> but the problem is, ajax is not making any call sometimes
[06:31:27] <StephenS> and I don't know wy
[06:31:28] <StephenS> why*
[06:32:19] <aMoniker> put console.log() statements in your updateChat() function and make sure it's getting run every x seconds
[06:32:44] <aMoniker> then look in the chrome network panel to see if the request is getting fired off, what its response code is, etc.
[06:34:49] <StephenS> to put console.log() after timeout?
[06:35:11] <aMoniker> or before, just inside the function
[06:35:17] <aMoniker> so you know it's being called
[06:46:06] <StephenS> console.log() is added
[06:46:12] <StephenS> and in console tab at chrome nothing showin
[06:47:29] <aMoniker> are you calling `console.log()` without any params?
[06:48:04] <StephenS> yes
[06:48:20] <aMoniker> I should have specified, you pass it something like `console.log('something')` or `console.log('something', some_object)`
[06:52:07] <StephenS> like console.log(updateChat()); ?
[06:52:30] <aMoniker> that would call the function updateChat
[06:52:34] <StephenS> Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[06:52:38] <aMoniker> right
[06:52:42] <StephenS> is console error
[06:52:51] <aMoniker> because you're calling the function inside the console.log()
[06:52:59] <aMoniker> which is in turn calling the function inside the console.log()...
[06:53:05] <aMoniker> infinite loop
[06:53:14] <StephenS> so how to call
[06:53:20] <StephenS> console.log outside of function?
[06:53:22] <aMoniker> you can really just do console.log('updateCall has run');
[06:53:24] <aMoniker> no
[06:53:38] <aMoniker> console.log is just to tell you that some arbitrary point in your code has been reached
[06:53:45] <aMoniker> and to optionally examine an object
[06:54:04] <StephenS> http://jsfiddle.net/HN9ed/1/ ?
[06:54:41] <aMoniker> http://jsfiddle.net/HN9ed/2/
[06:55:35] <StephenS> ok now in console chrome I have about to setInterval
[06:55:47] <StephenS> and its popping ..
[06:56:00] <StephenS> 3 about to setInterval
[06:56:15] <StephenS> etc/.... but sometimes this wont work, as ajax is not updating ..
[06:56:48] <aMoniker> ok, so you know the code is firing at least
[06:56:58] <aMoniker> now go to your Network tab in chrome
[06:57:08] <aMoniker> and select 'XHR' at the bottom
[06:57:59] <StephenS> yes I know all that
[06:58:03] <StephenS> 10/30 requested and its updating
[06:58:11] <StephenS> but how to find out, why is not updating/calling script sometimes?
[06:59:24] <aMoniker> what happens on the php side?
[06:59:32] <aMoniker> follow the request through your code there.
[06:59:53] <StephenS> 200 OK
[07:00:03] <StephenS> how to follow request?
[07:00:22] <aMoniker> go to your php code that receives that request
[07:00:26] <aMoniker> and put in debug statements
[07:00:41] <StephenS> ok now ajax updating stopped
[07:01:09] <StephenS> what to do now?
[07:01:15] <StephenS> how to put debug statements?
[07:02:36] <StephenS> in network monitoring, I have count.php get called, and after that image loaded from cache, does that have to do with something?
[07:03:04] <StephenS> And after that update is not called..
[07:03:36] <aMoniker> all the XHR requests are 200 ?
[07:05:38] <StephenS> Yes
[07:05:52] <StephenS> hmm I think its because I had jquery 6.* and js/jquery.js
[07:05:55] <StephenS> two jquery libs..
[07:06:00] <StephenS> maybe there was some conflict between those?
[07:06:50] <aMoniker> I don't know. Does removing one fix it?
[07:07:00] <StephenS> so far yes
[07:07:05] <aMoniker> there you go
[07:07:09] <StephenS> but I cannot know when will it stop
[07:07:11] <StephenS> so IM not sure yet
[07:10:08] <StephenS> object has no method .live
[07:10:18] <StephenS> what is this? error in log, I use 1.9.1 new js lib minified
[07:10:28] <StephenS> my old jquery.js on host is 1.6.1
[07:10:44] <aMoniker> try with your old one
[07:10:50] <aMoniker> maybe your code needs to be updated to use 1.9.1
[07:11:01] <StephenS> hmmm maybe
[07:13:03] <StephenS> on 1.6.1 works, on 1.9.1 it does not work
[07:13:04] <StephenS> damn
[07:13:24] <StephenS> what is this Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html:
[07:13:34] <StephenS> that resource is # as link, but calling modal, is thi sfine?
[07:14:43] <StephenS> this always loads athe last <img id="someid" style="display: none; position: absolute; top: 50px; right: 40px;" src="#" alt="your image" /> as parse, is something wrong with this code?
[07:16:33] <aMoniker> that should be valid html
[07:17:48] <mellotes> morning all -looking for a room for flashing android phones and the sort - i've been at it for six hours and feel like the water just gets deeper and deeper - anyone with experience that can point a finger would be appreciated.  deets: samsung infuse 4g  on froyo -> jelly bean (gaps on youtube and forums)
[07:19:18] <StephenS> damn its not fixed
[07:19:21] <StephenS> fucking ajax
[07:20:20] <StephenS> maybe instead of $.get I should use $.ajax() ?
[07:24:40] <StephenS> can you re-code with $.ajax() my $.get() aMoniker ?
[07:24:48] <StephenS> like you think it will work
[07:25:11] <aMoniker> you should be able to do that
[07:25:20] <aMoniker> just follow the $.ajax() documentation
[07:25:26] <aMoniker> I am available for hire though :)
[07:26:15] <StephenS> Which data Im sending in my case?
[07:27:31] <aMoniker> none, right?
[07:27:36] <aMoniker> you're just requesting data, I assume
[07:28:14] <StephenS> and what I do return on success?
[07:28:26] <StephenS> $("div#chattableq").html(data); ? I need data
[07:30:45] <StephenS> aMoniker, http://jsfiddle.net/HN9ed/4/ what is wrong\?
[07:30:49] <StephenS> It says I have no data param
[07:31:00] <StephenS> ah msg
[07:32:04] <StephenS> damn damn
[07:32:09] <StephenS> again not working
[07:32:19] <StephenS> I mean code work, but again something stops ajax call fuck shit
[07:35:02] <StephenS> hmm I debugged it aMoniker ]
[07:35:13] <StephenS> I get sometimes error on load with status 0, what is causing it?
[07:35:32] <aMoniker> ask your code
[07:37:13] <StephenS> hmm
[07:37:22] <StephenS> maybe its better to request values with post method?
[07:38:58] <StephenS> maybe firewall is blocking it
[07:39:03] <StephenS> because too many request in short time?
[07:39:06] <StephenS> or something lol
[07:39:37] <aMoniker> could be cosmic rays
[07:40:30] <StephenS> lol
[07:48:55] <StephenS> maybe I should use xmlhttp?
[08:07:13] <StephenS> aMoniker, is it possible that $(function(){ //some code } misconflict with my update ajax? its certanly somewhwere in that file as I have other functions but Im nto sure what is conflicting
[08:08:43] <aMoniker> it's hard to know without seeing the code, but I would guess no
[08:10:17] <StephenS> whys no?
[08:10:18] <StephenS> hmm
[08:10:29] <StephenS> something in that file is conflicting, as i removed all code from it
[08:10:33] <StephenS> and ajax worked perfectly..
[08:10:56] <StephenS> however I have one mroe ajax in the same file
[08:11:01] <StephenS> maybe thats confusing it somehow..
[08:13:33] <StephenS> found it
[08:13:36] <StephenS> tooltip is a problem
[08:14:20] <StephenS> you know that image whcih I show you?
[08:14:24] <StephenS> it was using tooltip for title
[08:14:30] <StephenS> now I dont get how that conflict but it does
[08:19:58] <StephenS> It was crappy tooltip anyway, Ill use tipsy
[08:34:47] <StephenS> Им со хаппз ноњ
[08:34:52] <StephenS> Im so happy now
[08:37:06] <StephenS> aMoniker, does jquery have some security issues which I should focus on?
[08:37:08] <StephenS> what is eval()?
[08:37:27] <StephenS> or just to focus on server side language?
[08:43:26] <aMoniker> any code that runs in a browser can be considered to be compromised
[08:43:35] <aMoniker> you can obfuscate it, but that's about it
[08:43:42] <aMoniker> server-side has to handle all the security
[09:05:36] <bluesm>  Using the $("#something").find("li");  instead of $("#something li")
[09:05:40] <bluesm> is only for performance issued ?
[09:05:45] <bluesm> Because jquery function will have less "string analyzing" ?
[09:06:24] <systemfault> I'm not sure why would anyone use the former..
[09:12:09] <aMoniker> I've seen that recommendation as well… would be nice to know the answer
[09:12:16] <AbX> hey folks, some trouble with "draggable"... n elements draggable inside cointainment. so far so good, no i want to disallow dragging to a certain region?
[09:12:41] <AbX> this region is inside the wanted container
[09:12:50] <bluesm> systemfault:  Maybe less code ?
[09:13:13] <systemfault> aMoniker: Perhaps that the selector engine has a microoptimization that makes it call getElementById if the selector contains only an id..
[09:13:22] <systemfault> bluesm: I don't know...
[09:13:37] <aMoniker> systemfault: maybe, but wouldn't it do that anyway if it was a single string?
[09:13:51] <systemfault> bluesm: But picking the one with find over the other doesn't make sense in any case.
[09:14:10] <systemfault> aMoniker: You mean?
[09:14:34] <aMoniker> systemfault: I would assume it would break the selector into pieces, then start with the left most, which is an id
[09:14:46] <aMoniker> http://www.sitepoint.com/efficient-jquery-selectors/ this page seems to think that the selector engine starts from the rightmost term
[09:14:57] <aMoniker> dunno if that's true… I can't see why it would be built like that
[09:15:00] <systemfault> aMoniker: Perhaps… or it could pass the string directly to querySelectorAll
[09:15:31] <AbX>      
[09:15:34] <aMoniker> systemfault: easiest way to tell is just to run a performance test
[09:15:43] <bluesm> systemfault: Why it doesn't make any sense ? It should be faster...
[09:16:06] <systemfault> bluesm: Using the .find would be faster?
[09:16:16] <systemfault> And even if it was… do we care?
[09:16:38] <bluesm> systemfault: It's is supposed to be 50% faster.
[09:16:47] <aMoniker> systemfault: another page seems to think that it is indeed right-to-left selection, but there was an optimization in 1.4 for id-first selectors
[09:16:50] <systemfault> Is 0.00000001 second instead of 0.000001 second worth the readability cost?
[09:17:08] <aMoniker> actually… find is more readable to me
[09:17:18] <systemfault> Then you should learn CSS...
[09:17:20] <systemfault> It's a must.
[09:17:34] <aMoniker> I probably know more CSS than you.
[09:20:07] <systemfault> I don't mind if you know it more than me… Just saying that $("#something li") should be incredibly readable to anyone with basics CSS knowledge.
[09:20:35] <aMoniker> it is, but I prefer $('#something').find('li');
[09:20:49] <AbX> is there any way to allow dragging only inside a certain "div.allowd" but not in "div.allowd > div.notAllowd"? to exclude a certain area of containment?
[09:22:18] <ryanneufeld> AbX: http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-containment
[09:23:22] <aMoniker> AbX: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10456234/resizing-a-jquery-draggable-elements-containment-parent-while-dragging
[09:23:45] <aMoniker> It might be simple if your div.notAllowed is the same width or height as the parent.. then you just set your own boundaries
[09:24:20] <aMoniker> but if it's a random div in the middle of div.allowed, you'd have to write your own drag handler function to stop from dragging over it
[09:25:18] <systemfault> aMoniker: Like I said… the difference is negligible. I guess you should pick the one you prefer :/ http://jsperf.com/jquery-select-find-vs-select
[09:25:55] <aMoniker> nearly twice as efficient to use find()
[09:26:09] <aMoniker> no, I read that wrong
[09:26:55] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: systemfault you guys should both do some reading about sizzle. Cause in 1.9 it's much more efficient.  http://jsperf.com/sizzle-1-7-2-vs-1-8
[09:26:58] <aMoniker> you could conceivably bump into that limit on a really js-intensive app
[09:27:12] <systemfault> ryanneufeld: My jsperf is probably using the latest one.
[09:27:57] <systemfault> Do we read the same jsperf? :(
[09:28:20] <systemfault> ?js 1/182205
[09:28:21] <ryanneufeld> systemfault: the jsperf I linked shows more test cases, and is a better over all example of the perf gains present in current jquery versions

[09:28:42] <AbX> amoniker: hmm it think i have to implement my own drag-handler... it is not a random div, but with other width & height... it is just a div containing the control-buttons, but the user must not be able to drag tooltips to this area (or otherwise save/revert-buttons a not accessible anymore)
[09:28:53] <systemfault> OH NOES, my application will slow down like hell if I use one over the other ;)
[09:29:29] <ryanneufeld> the real point here is that you'll probably never notice either way
[09:29:38] <systemfault> ryanneufeld: Right :)
[09:29:40] <ryanneufeld> there is nothing 'wrong' with doing it the way aMoniker was
[09:29:41] <aMoniker> in a very complex app it could, but normally ryanneufeld is right
[09:30:11] <aMoniker> AbX: could you just reject any tooltips that were dropped into that area, but still let the user drag over it?
[09:30:11] <systemfault> aMoniker: Even in the most complex app… if it makes a difference, you should rework your code.
[09:30:30] <aMoniker> systemfault: exactly what I'm saying
[09:31:06] <ryanneufeld> What I'm saying, is that the debate is moot
[09:32:50] <AbX> amoniker: i could reject it (server-side), but where to place it then? or did u mean client-based?
[09:33:08] <ryanneufeld> AbX: you'd need to reject it client side
[09:33:13] <ryanneufeld> in the javascript
[09:34:00] <systemfault> ryanneufeld: BTW.. just tested my jsperf snippet with jquery 2.0beta2
[09:34:05] <systemfault> ryanneufeld: Nice speedup
[09:34:28] <systemfault> 50% faster
[09:34:38] <ryanneufeld> systemfault: yeah, the guys on the sizzle team have really stepped it up
[09:35:07] <aMoniker> AbX: you should be able to reject it in the drop handler if you detect that it was dropped on the not-allowed element, then just have it snap back to it's original position
[09:35:29] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: do you know why .find is faster? systemfault?
[09:35:45] <AbX> amoniker: k, thx i will try that :)
[09:35:46] <aMoniker> ryanneufeld: didn't systemfault just prove that find was slower?
[09:35:58] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: not even close
[09:35:59] <systemfault> aMoniker: THe opposite
[09:36:07] <systemfault> ryanneufeld: .find is twice as fast
[09:36:07] <ryanneufeld> .find is MUCH faster
[09:36:09] <aMoniker> man, I'm reading all sorts of graphs wrong today
[09:36:23] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: on jsperf, higher score is better
[09:36:27] <BillyJoe> In jquery-mobile, how do I position the checkbox label OUTSIDE the checkbox 'button'? When clicking the label I don't want the checkbox to be toggled.
[09:36:45] <ryanneufeld> BillyJoe: why?
[09:36:51] <systemfault> ryanneufeld: Must be because selectors are parsed from right to left like aMoniker said
[09:36:55] <ryanneufeld> you're making it harder to use that way
[09:36:59] <aMoniker> that seems odd though.. you'd think the first selector would get split out and passed to find transparently if it were so much faster
[09:37:14] <aMoniker> systemfault: but why are they? that's the opposite of what I expect
[09:37:32] <ryanneufeld> systemfault: nope, there is a regex, if it' s a simple ID, it just short circuits to gebid
[09:37:46] <aMoniker> regex must be slow then
[09:37:48] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: it does
[09:37:58] <ryanneufeld> and the regex happens every time
[09:38:21] <BillyJoe> ryanneufeld, I want the label to be a link to "terms and conditions"
[09:38:41] <ryanneufeld> BillyJoe: then it's not a label
[09:38:43] <ryanneufeld> it's a link
[09:38:55] <ryanneufeld> and it should be presented as such ;)
[09:39:44] <systemfault> ryanneufeld: Good to know
[09:40:39] <systemfault> I was right then when I said [12:13px] systemfault: aMoniker: Perhaps that the selector engine has a microoptimization that makes it call getElementById if the selector contains only an id.. :D
[09:41:06] <BillyJoe> ryanneufeld I know, but I can't really come up with a good way of doing it. Conceptually such a link is normally considered to be a link inside the label. Maybe you have an example link to show me how it could be done?
[09:41:35] <ryanneufeld> systemfault: I'm 99% sure that it doesn't even get to Sizzle if it's a simple id/class/element
[09:42:19] <systemfault> sizzle is just a reimplementation of QSA, right? (with extensions)
[09:42:31] <skope> is there an easy way to get query string values in jquery?
[09:42:52] <systemfault> It probably means that sizzle doesn't do as much in jQuery 2.0 since a lot can be passed to QSA
[09:43:06] <systemfault> skope: Could you elaborate?
[09:43:09] <systemfault> Ahh
[09:43:12] <systemfault> Query string
[09:43:20] <ryanneufeld> systemfault: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L130
[09:43:26] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L130
[09:43:32] <systemfault> skope: There's nothing included for that :(
[09:43:37] <ryanneufeld> BillyJoe: do you have a demo?
[09:43:41] <skope> http://url.tld/index.php?id=foo&something=bar
[09:43:50] <skope> i need values for id and something
[09:43:52] <ryanneufeld> skope: you don't need js for that
[09:43:57] <ryanneufeld> *jquery
[09:44:09] <ryanneufeld> skope: you can get that from the window.location object
[09:44:27] <skope> ryanneufeld: gotta see
[09:44:56] <aMoniker> systemfault: cool, but I'm still wondering about the rtl parsing
[09:45:25] <systemfault> aMoniker: I know that CSS itself works like that… I don't know for sizzle or even QSA
[09:45:44] <ryanneufeld> skope: window.location.search
[09:46:05] <BillyJoe> ryanneufeld, I'll make one for ya, I'll be back!
[09:46:14] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: Sizzle is the selector engine jquery uses. The source is on github
[09:46:24] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: if you really wanted to find out, you could :)
[09:46:29] <aMoniker> maybe it's faster in native js to get all elements on a page and check their lineage rather than get the children of a specific element
[09:46:56] <aMoniker> ryanneufeld: you mean I can read their code for free!?
[09:47:04] <ryanneufeld> the DOM provides ways of getting the children of an item if you have it
[09:47:13] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: yes, cool right?
[09:47:14] <aMoniker> right, but maybe that's slower
[09:47:42] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: not sure how, since you're traversing the DOM one way or another
[09:48:32] <aMoniker> ryanneufeld: true, I'm just not familiar enough with implementations to know which is faster
[09:48:48] <aMoniker> and if they do go RTL there's obviously some reason for it
[09:48:54] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: I'm sure it varies by browser
[09:49:57] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: if you're really interested in how they do it
[09:49:57] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/4bd24fccc7c00191d57c09f111b074f516203369/sizzle.js#L248
[09:50:03] <ryanneufeld> you can read there.
[09:51:33] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/4bd24fccc7c00191d57c09f111b074f516203369/sizzle.js#L248
[09:51:41] <ryanneufeld> that's where it gets really interesting
[09:53:03] <BillyJoe> How can I achieve this in jquerymobile? http://oi45.tinypic.com/ka60lt.jpg
[09:53:10] <BillyJoe> ryanneufeld ^^
[09:53:43] <ryanneufeld> BillyJoe: that is a bit trickier..
[09:54:28] <BillyJoe> ryanneufeld I know, I've been trying, and I've been googling............
[09:54:42] <ryanneufeld> BillyJoe: gimme a min
[09:54:54] <BillyJoe> ryanneufeld sure
[09:55:02] <ryanneufeld> BillyJoe: what versions of jq and jqm are you using?
[09:55:54] <BillyJoe> jqm: 1.3.0, jq: 1.9.1
[09:56:55] <ryanneufeld> BillyJoe: nice
[09:56:58] <ryanneufeld> k, gimme a min
[09:58:12] <aMoniker> ryanneufeld: interesting, but I'd have to spend a lot more time reading to really understand sizzle
[09:58:24] <ryanneufeld> aMoniker: you and me both
[10:05:20] <ryanneufeld> BillyJoe: could something like this work for you? http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/AHFch/1/
[10:08:14] <ryanneufeld> BillyJoe: the problem I see with what you're trying to do here is the User interface.  Have you loaded that on your phone to see how easy it would be to tap on one or the other?
[10:09:07] <BillyJoe> ryanneufeld, funny enough we will primarily use it in a desktop browser actually. For our specific application, jquery-mobile is great even for desktop use.
[10:09:44] <BillyJoe> ryanneufeld regarding your fiddle, I could do it something like that I think! But I will remove the "Yes" text and resize it
[10:09:55] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it's all css
[10:09:56] <BillyJoe> but maybe grids is the way to do it
[10:10:07] <ryanneufeld> and you can customize them however you see fit
[10:10:19] <BillyJoe> ryanneufeld, true
[10:12:50] <ryanneufeld> BillyJoe: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/AHFch/2/
[10:13:04] <ryanneufeld> I had to use !important due to how the styles cascade in jsfiddle
[10:13:45] <ryanneufeld> but if you loaded a custom css after the jqm css you wouldn't need it
[10:13:55] <BillyJoe> ryanneufeld, thanks, actually I think I'll do it this way :)
[10:14:07] <BillyJoe> I'll come back later in case I can't get it to work
[10:14:43] <ryanneufeld> BillyJoe: np, just keep in mind that it's called jQueryMobile for a reason... :)
[10:20:15] <fris> how would i combine two statements into 1 function, dont want to reuse code two times, $('#search').click(function(e) { and $.jQee('shift+s', function(e) { is what i want in 1, not sure it can be done
[10:20:55] <BillyJoe> ryanneufeld, yes, because it _also_ works great on mobile devices!!
[10:21:20] <ryanneufeld> BillyJoe: because it _also_ works on desktop, and was built for mobile first :P
[10:22:54] <BillyJoe> ryanneufeld ahhh
[10:55:04] <fris> how can i combine 2 statements in 1 function call? example these two $('#search').click(function(e) { and $.jQee('shift+s', function(e) {
[10:56:52] <aMoniker> fris: name the function and pass it as an argument
[10:58:57] <t432> Can you do this? this.on("blur focus keydown keypress keyup",this.trigger('uiKeyPressed',{data: this.$node.length}));
[10:59:25] <t432> getting "this.$node" is undefined
[11:06:00] <systemfault> t432: The "this" inside the handler is a different one than outside..
[11:06:44] <fris> aMoniker did that, got it working with $('#search').click(executesearch); but the $.jQee('shift+s').executesearch(); fires off cannot call method of undefined
[11:07:26] <nocturne7> I am trying to use JQuery Datatables. when I hide a column and try to use fnRowCallback, indices get messed up
[11:07:31] <nocturne7> how do I deal with this darn thing ?
[11:07:32] <aMoniker> fris: executesearch is not a property of $.jQee('shift+s')
[11:08:44] <aMoniker> fris: $.jQee('shift+s', executesearch);
[11:09:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is it allowed to invent an attribute to use for Jquery ui tooltip?
[11:09:56] <aMoniker> fris: also, you should use $('#search').on('click', executesearch);
[11:10:01] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: Only if prefixed with data-
[11:10:11] <systemfault> data-lol="10" is a validHTML5 attribute
[11:10:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ok, but not in earlier html versions?
[11:10:52] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: Nope… fortunately, it still works in all HTML4 browsers AFAIK
[11:11:21] <systemfault> tldr; works everywhere… but only specified in HTML5
[11:12:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> thx!
[11:12:42] <t432> systemfault: the trigger will fire when the on the events, right?
[11:13:33] <t432> I mean is the trigger defined correctly if you ignore the "this" error?
[11:13:38] <aep> any idea why i get parseerror for an ajax requesy although the response is just {} ?
[11:14:44] <fris> aMoniker thanks ;)
[11:14:55] <aMoniker> fris: yw :)
[11:27:07] <StephenS> is this going to save my resources and threads, http://jsfiddle.net/8wFFb/ this is long polling right?
[11:27:19] <StephenS> is there any better way to do it with ajax (not using sockets or comet..)
[11:27:32] <teitoklein01> guys i am implementing a chat system. can anyone give me an idea on how to implement a notification. like when someone message me I can see a red "1" on the nav bar?
[11:29:12] <aMoniker> teitoklein01: redis + websockets, or ajax polling
[11:29:14] <StephenS> teitoklein01, lol this is what I do, checkout my jsfiddle
[11:29:29] <StephenS> I would not recommend websockets as not all browsers supports it
[11:29:39] <StephenS> Unless you drop on comet if sockets are not supported
[11:29:53] <teitoklein01> @StephenS what would you recommend best
[11:29:58] <StephenS> aMoniker, how about my code? Is it good?
[11:30:19] <StephenS> teitoklein01, I use ajax pooling atm, but Ill switch to sockets and if not supported drop to comet
[11:30:40] <teitoklein01> so comet is the most cross-platformed?
[11:30:42] <aMoniker> StephenS: looks ok, does it run?
[11:30:44] <StephenS> But its pretty complex situation
[11:30:59] <StephenS> aMoniker, yes it does run, everything work as charm, however Im afraid of apache thread flood
[11:31:15] <StephenS> Is this code good and it will not flood srv? I see requests everuy second in network
[11:31:29] <aMoniker> depends on how many users
[11:31:29] <StephenS> teitoklein01, comet is good for web chat apps
[11:31:44] <StephenS> aMoniker, 2 million?
[11:31:55] <teitoklein01> yeah my user was also about millions
[11:32:00] <didiergm> nocturne7 you would be best server by going to datatables.net forums as your question is not a jQuery one.
[11:32:30] <StephenS> teitoklein01, what ya creating? chatroullete? :P
[11:32:42] <aMoniker> StephenS: Why every second then… why not 5 or 10 if you can get away with it?
[11:32:53] <StephenS> I did changed it to 10 seconds
[11:32:56] <teitoklein01> @StephenS mobile website like skout maybe?
[11:33:06] <StephenS> timeout is 50000 and request again is set to 10000
[11:33:18] <teitoklein01> @StephenS you know skout? the flirting app?
[11:33:24] <StephenS> However what does 50000 timeout mean anyway?
[11:33:34] <StephenS> I see requests every 10 seconds now, but what is 50 secs for?
[11:34:52] <StephenS> aMoniker, ?
[11:34:55] <StephenS> techlife, no
[11:34:57] <StephenS> teitoklein01, npo
[11:35:10] <aMoniker> StephenS: read the docs
[11:35:21] <aMoniker> that's when the request gives up if there's no response
[11:36:03] <StephenS> Set a timeout (in milliseconds) for the request. This will override any global timeout set with $.ajaxSetup().
[11:36:13] <StephenS> ah just that?
[11:36:31] <StephenS> So if there is no response from my php file, it wil try 50 secs more and then quit?
[11:36:34] <StephenS> blah
[11:39:54] <StephenS> aMoniker, uhm do you know how to update title after notification is sent
[11:39:58] <StephenS> I mean I know how to, but I have some problems
[11:40:13] <StephenS> Its adding all those new numbers all over again
[11:40:51] <StephenS> here is what I have http://jsfiddle.net/B95KK/
[11:41:41] <aMoniker> StephenS: you're adding curtitle everytime… so it just grows
[11:41:54] <StephenS> hmm so how to replace it?
[11:42:00] <StephenS> It will grow but with replacement?
[11:42:04] <StephenS> is there .replace()
[11:42:07] <aMoniker> either regex or rebuild
[11:42:30] <aMoniker> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[11:42:32] <StephenS> Ill try with replaceWith
[11:43:32] <StephenS> nice $('title').replaceWith().html("("+data+") "+curtitle); works :)
[11:43:59] <StephenS> oh it does not :)
[11:44:04] <StephenS> :( what is wrong with that code?
[11:44:12] <teitoklein01> hi guys how do chat systems detect when the user is typing. like on facebook. "MyName" is typing......
[11:44:51] <StephenS> .keypress
[11:46:01] <teitoklein01> but what if they are both typing?
[11:46:09] <teitoklein01> oh well that's an if
[11:46:10] <aMoniker> StephenS: replaceWith() doesn't do what you think it does
[11:46:14] <aMoniker> this time you have to look it up
[11:46:27] <StephenS> look up what?
[11:46:33] <StephenS> hmm
[11:49:33] <StephenS> so how to do it aMoniker ?
[11:49:56] <aMoniker> check the link above
[11:50:06] <StephenS> Which
[11:50:17] <StephenS> ah
[11:50:41] <StephenS> Why do I need a regex?
[11:50:49] <StephenS> cant I just replace it somehow and all the way through?
[11:51:55] <aMoniker> you could store whatever your title starts as, then just add that every time
[11:52:47] <StephenS> thats what Im doing
[11:52:54] <StephenS> but I dont want to add it everytime, I want to replace it
[11:53:51] <aMoniker> you're not… you're getting curtitle everytime
[11:53:53] <StephenS> hmm only to put it out of loop
[11:54:02] <StephenS> but how to add data then eh
[11:54:22] <StephenS> yeah you're right
[11:54:33] <StephenS> I need to store previous number and delete it
[11:54:36] <StephenS> ugh
[12:05:08] <cli> hi everyone
[12:05:21] <cli> is there any way to trigger if a function has been called ?
[12:08:14] <StephenS> Clex, if (!gotContacts) ?
[12:08:24] <StephenS> or for called just remove !
[12:10:24] <aMoniker> cli: you could use a pub/sub model to trigger an event within the function, then watch for that event elsewhere
[12:16:45] <cli> amoniker: i can't alter that function, i just wanted to executed my own function whenever thatone is executed. Reason i can't alter that function is that I don't want to modify core of that package (for easier maintenaince upgrade in future)
[12:16:57] <cli> *wanted to execute
[12:16:59] <Clex> Hm?
[12:17:27] <cli> anyways other solution is to find a way to trigger id's that are changing
[12:17:29] <cli> brb
[12:20:06] <cli> any hint of how could I trigger a click event on an id that has a random number at the end? eq: "test-45"
[12:25:16] <kojul> cli: you could use the attribute selector $('[id^="test-"]').click(…)
[12:27:37] <cli> kojul thanks, ill try right now
[12:40:09] <cli> kojul: you code works just fine in a jsfiddle test but on my dev it fails. May it be because the html/ids are ajax generated?
[12:40:31] <cli> *your
[12:40:45] <kojul> that would be true.
[12:40:50] <kojul> are they in a parent container?
[12:42:17] <kojul> if you know the parent is going to be, say #test-container, you can use delegation and .on like so: $('#test-container').on('click', '[id^="test-"]', function() {…});
[12:45:28] <cli> kojul: i think it's because there is a js that already has an click event on same element, it deletes the trigered element and adds another with a number at the end. that number increases on each click
[12:46:48] <cli> http://jsfiddle.net/xEwn8/
[12:47:54] <kojul> whoa there. that's some messy html.
[12:48:00] <cli> yep sorry
[12:48:00] <cli> np
[12:48:19] <cli> it looks like that the only parent that has an id is the form itself (3 levels up)
[12:48:21] <cli> brb testing
[12:48:43] <systemfault> A webpage in français
[12:49:21] <cli> yep + drupal lol
[12:49:22] <cli> brb
[12:49:27] <kojul> cli: it's because you're adding objects to the DOM after the click event is bound to the current ones.
[12:50:03] <cli> kojul what should I do ?
[12:50:09] <kojul> cli: that's why you need to use .on anytime you use ajax, and you don't necessarily need an id.
[12:51:24] <systemfault> Or use event delegation, the second form of .on
[12:51:39] <cli> kojul thats the core of drupal doing that ajax (field collection module) and I wouldn't like altering core, Im thinking at rewriting a copy of this module only to avoid issues on update
[12:51:43] <kojul> systemfault: that's what i've been saying the entire time.
[12:51:50] <cli> trying :)
[12:51:54] <cli> thanks for help guys
[12:51:54] <systemfault> kojul: I missed the beginning :(
[12:55:29] <kojul> cli: it really depends which part is loaded via ajax. if you're talking about the remove buttons in each row, then the parent could be the table, and it can be any parent that exists when the page is loaded initially. so you could even use $(document).on but it will be faster as you get to a closer parent and using delegation on document is generally sloppy.
[12:56:31] <benjick> Hi. I'm having some trouble with caroufredsel. It skips the second image.
[12:57:56] <cli> kojul the last input edit-field-facture-items-und-add-more--4 on the last div from that example is generated after clicking on edit-field-facture-items-und-add-more--3 wich got removed and so on starting with -1
[12:58:55] <cli> it actually inserts a line of fields in that table
[12:59:20] <kojul> so does the id of the table change each time as well?
[12:59:31] <cli> yep
[12:59:37] <cli> with +1 each time
[12:59:43] <cli> btw Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'on'
[13:00:13] <cli> brb
[13:00:15] <kojul> wow, that's amazingly… wrong.
[13:00:27] <kojul> what version of query are you using?
[13:00:33] <kojul> jquery…
[13:01:31] <cli> 1.5.2
[13:01:36] <systemfault> Oh boy..
[13:01:41] <systemfault> That's old.
[13:01:50] <systemfault> Not prehistoric… but old
[13:02:01] <cli> systemfault: it comes with drupal, I'll try to remove it and add the google one
[13:02:07] <kojul> well, then yea, you don't have .on
[13:02:19] <kojul> i don't even know if .live was in 1.5.2
[13:02:45] <systemfault> kojul: Yeah, .live is the oldest function to do event delegation
[13:02:56] <systemfault> .live then .delegate then now .on
[13:03:21] <kojul> systemfault: I just wasn't sure when event delegation was actually added to jquery.
[13:04:59] <kojul> systemfault: because before live was part of core, it was a plugin.
[13:05:08] <cli> kojul: it looks like on click, on that same element, drupal inserts a new line of 4 fields + an "add new line" button then it removes the previous "add new line" button
[13:05:20] <cli> brb
[13:05:49] <systemfault> kojul: 1.3 from what I can read
[13:05:56] <kojul> cli: reasons i can't stand big CMS's like drupal.
[13:06:16] <kojul> systemfault: good to know, and .delegate was 1.4.3?
[13:06:29] <cli> kojul, thats the way i earn money, from ppl asking drupal :)
[13:06:35] <cli> brb
[13:06:41] <kojul> cli: you might be better off binding to the class instead of the id.
[13:06:47] <systemfault> kojul: 1.4.2
[13:06:54] <kojul> ah
[13:07:01] <systemfault> You were close :D
[13:07:34] <defaultro> I had a question to the guys in #php. What do you think?  Here it is -------> Is this possible? Assign a value that is retrieved from a jquery ajax request to a PHP session variable?
[13:08:33] <systemfault> Probably… by using another ajax call
[13:08:48] <bluesm_> What does 'every browser have slightly different Dom Interface' mean ?
[13:08:53] <systemfault> Seems like a weird idea..
[13:08:54] <defaultro> ok, I'm interested but my brain couldn't think how to do it
[13:09:07] <bluesm_> I heard it on try.jquery.com
[13:09:33] <systemfault> bluesm_: Because some things were implemented before they were standardizes
[13:09:35] <bluesm_> It's rather not true.
[13:09:37] <systemfault> -s-d
[13:10:06] <systemfault> Well, the differences exists
[13:10:29] <bluesm_> systemfault: for example?
[13:10:44] <bluesm_> Getelemtsbyclassname?
[13:10:51] <cli> kojul: on class failed (i think for the very same reason it failed on $('[id^="test-"]').click() . Doing jquery update and trying .on parent
[13:11:26] <bluesm_> (Sorry I'm on mobile)
[13:11:43] <systemfault> bluesm_: Event handling functions (attachEvent vs addEventListener), event types (bubbling vs capturing), XHR (An activeX object on older IE), the Selector APIs (querySelectorAll), innerHTML
[13:12:33] <systemfault> bluesm_: Then you have all the newer prefixed functions… MozTransform webkitTransform.. et
[13:12:34] <systemfault> c
[13:13:48] <bluesm_> systemfault: OK CSS transitions In jquerry would be inserted with all prefixes. Right?
[13:14:06] <systemfault> bluesm_: AFAIK, jQuery doesn't support transitions
[13:14:16] <systemfault> bluesm_: There are third-party plugins though.
[13:15:08] <kojul> bluesm_: i use jquery.transit.js for some things.
[13:16:12] <bluesm_> systemfault : OK but what are incompatibilities between modern browsers that jqueery could solve (ie10 Firefox 18 opera 12 and chrome 25)
[13:16:42] <systemfault> bluesm_: Not much of them, that's the reason why jQuery 2.0 is being written in parallel with 1.9
[13:17:11] <systemfault> jQuery 2.0 will ditch of lot of legacy stuff
[13:17:16] <bluesm_> kojul: OK but my point is get to known where query helps in modern browsers
[13:17:44] <systemfault> bluesm_: learn and use normal DOM methods, you'll understand :)
[13:17:58] <systemfault> Pure DOM is F'ing verbose.
[13:18:12] <kojul> bluesm_: ok, so figure out the entire feature list of jquery. it does that cross-browser for the browsers listed on the home page.
[13:19:06] <systemfault> Also.. event delegation is a pain to do without a lib..
[13:20:27] <kojul> good for jquery 2.0. finally dropping support for old ie.
[13:21:17] <kojul> cli: ever get it working?
[13:23:01] <cli> kojul, was on phone sorry, i'll update jquery the way drupal wants it right now
[13:23:18] <bluesm_> Systemfault : in modern browsers too ?
[13:24:55] <systemfault> bluesm_: Not that bad if the browser supports matches
[13:25:56] <bluesm_> Systemfault : considering last version of 5 biggest browsers ?
[13:26:04] <systemfault> bluesm_: Usable.
[13:26:29] <systemfault> bluesm_: You can't avoid the ridiculous java-esque verbosity though..
[13:26:47] <systemfault> As the DOM interface it made to be used by different languages
[13:26:51] <systemfault> *is made
[13:27:50] <bluesm_> Systemfault: could you put example of methods that javascript have no equivalent (considering last versions of modern browsers)
[13:28:06] <StephenS> I have <form><a href="#"><span class="close number"  style="display:none;">x</span></a> </form> so I have multiple forms in html and I use  $("form #closeshow") {
[13:28:07] <StephenS> alert("ALERT!");
[13:28:07] <StephenS> } which does not work, why?
[13:28:34] <systemfault> bluesm_: That question doesn't make sense.. if jQuery is written in Javascript then Javascript can do anything jQuery can..
[13:29:01] <dblosevn> stephan48: $('#closeshow').click(function() { alert('ALERT!'); } );
[13:29:06] <StephenS> oik
[13:29:07] <StephenS> ok
[13:29:15] <systemfault> bluesm_: I personally like the promise interface of jQuery even if it's not required
[13:29:22] <dblosevn> form#closeshow is redundant
[13:29:28] <StephenS> What is closeshow?
[13:29:48] <dblosevn> you used it in your example...
[13:29:48] <StephenS> I mean k
[13:29:49] <bluesm_> Systemfault: I know. But I mean methods (3
[13:30:12] <StephenS> hmm still not working, but class closeshow is inside the form
[13:30:15] <dblosevn> how the hell am i supossed to know lmao, i assume its something clickable lmao
[13:30:23] <dblosevn> class ...
[13:30:49] <bluesm_> Methods that aren't just links to the JavaScript methods (especially Dom methods
[13:30:58] <dblosevn> $('form.closeshow').submit(function() { alert('ALERT!'); });
[13:31:36] <StephenS> neither work
[13:31:37] <StephenS> ugh
[13:31:43] <StephenS> form#closeshow not working eitheer
[13:32:10] <kojul> 'form .close.number'
[13:33:10] <systemfault> bluesm_: Example (webkitonly) of event delegation in  pure dom.. http://jsfiddle.net/w7RBr/
[13:33:57] <dblosevn> if the form has the class clsoeshow then its form.closeshow
[13:34:09] <StephenS> sec
[13:34:13] <dblosevn> if closeshow is a child of form then its form .closeshow
[13:34:33] <StephenS> here http://jsfiddle.net/ywkgV/
[13:34:35] <kojul> well, the only thing in the form html that he posted was the span, with two classes, close and number
[13:34:42] <StephenS> a snippet, I have multiple forms so I need self too
[13:34:44] <dblosevn> # represents an id
[13:34:44] <systemfault> bluesm_: See.. even for that, you need prefixes.
[13:34:51] <systemfault> bluesm_: On the most recent browsers
[13:34:52] <dblosevn> not a class
[13:36:01] <StephenS> so whats wrong with my fiddle?
[13:36:42] <cli> kojul, i did the jquery update, no erros but doesn't get trigered, brb
[13:38:34] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/ywkgV/1/ @ stephan48
[13:40:39] <StephenS> you mean me? :D
[13:41:01] <dblosevn> that too lol
[13:41:19] <StephenS> works fuck shit yes THANKS!
[13:41:27] <kojul> cli: i'd love to stay and help, but I gotta get going, someone else here can probably help you with delegation
[13:41:35] <dblosevn> hmm, somebodys bi polar
[13:42:01] <dblosevn> or has turrets
[13:42:47] <bluesm_> Systemfault: OK thanks.
[13:43:18] <systemfault> bluesm_: See how verbose it is compared to the jquery version?
[13:43:58] <StephenS> ayo dblosevn self.hide(); whats wrong with that
[13:44:05] <StephenS> now thats some weird fucked up sh**
[13:44:13] <systemfault> bluesm_: Emulating .matches() http://jsfiddle.net/w7RBr/1/
[13:44:36] <StephenS> eh $(self).
[13:44:42] <StephenS> I need some sleep :(
[13:45:51] <StephenS> ugh ok now why $(self).hide(); does not actually close the form?
[13:46:05] <StephenS> such as $(self).hide('form'); dblosevn ?
[13:48:12] <StephenS> nvm
[13:49:37] <dblosevn> $(this).closest('form').hide();
[13:49:50] <StephenS> closest?
[13:49:53] <StephenS> First time heard
[13:50:04] <dblosevn> ?jquery.closest @ StephenS
[13:50:06] <bot-t> StephenS, .closest() | jQuery API Documentation - Get the first ancestor element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[13:50:22] <StephenS> ah thanks :)
[13:50:35] <StephenS> I thought to use .find('form').hide();
[13:50:52] <dblosevn> .find find decendents of the current element
[13:51:01] <dblosevn> *finds
[13:51:05] <StephenS> yeha that does not work
[13:51:07] <dblosevn> not ancestors
[13:51:54] <cli> kojul or systemfault if ur still here: http://dev1.kdoexpress.net/node/add/facture <- there is the entire html and the javascript is http://dev1.kdoexpress.net/sites/default/files/js_injector/js_injector_1.js?mjgpqk All i want is to be able to triger that darn id edit-field-facture-items-und-add-more with number at the end :)
[13:53:06] <systemfault> cli: What am I supposed to click?
[13:53:34] <cli> "Ajouter un autre element" under Produits :
[13:53:34] <cli> Désignation
[13:54:08] <cohitre> cli: instead of using an id give them all the same class and use a class selector
[13:54:44] <systemfault> cli: I don't understand what doesn't work.. it successfully adds a row
[13:54:58] <systemfault> And clicking "retirer" successfully removes the row
[13:55:27] <cli> Systemfault in  http://dev1.kdoexpress.net/sites/default/files/js_injector/js_injector_1.js i try to add my own selector so I add my own calculations to the total
[13:55:45] <cli> systemfault: it looks like i can't trigger the same click of edit-field-facture-items-und-add-more
[13:55:55] <cli> #edit-field-facture-items-und-add-more
[13:58:37] <systemfault> Damn it's soo bad :(
[13:58:51] <cli> ?
[13:58:54] <systemfault> The code
[13:59:12] <cli> thats contrib code from modules of drupal.org
[13:59:20] <systemfault> So when you click on the ajouter un element button, you want the alert() to trigger?
[13:59:23] <systemfault> It's just that?
[13:59:24] <cli> yep
[13:59:30] <cli> then I can handle the rest
[14:01:06] <cli> (I hope lol! As all my task is simple, to do a calculation of that items at the end :)
[14:01:32] <cli> this shoulve been easy too but I'm stuck on this
[14:01:59] <systemfault> Normally.. jQuery(document).on('click', '#edit-field-facture-items-und-add-more', function() { alert('lol'); }); would work
[14:02:34] <cli> systemfault: that #edit-field-facture-items-und-add-more if u click it gets a number at the end
[14:02:38] <cli> so its other id after click
[14:02:43] <systemfault> Ahhh
[14:02:47] <cli> I'd like to trigger any of those ids
[14:03:43] <cli> actually I think it removes it from current position, adds the new line items and then adds one again a button with that number at the end eq #edit-field-facture-items-und-add-more--1
[14:04:01] <cli> *once again
[14:04:56] <bluesm_> Systemfault: OK I see thank you very much
[14:05:57] <StephenS> wtf is wrong with that code dblosevn, its not working on firefox??
[14:09:33] <StephenS> k works now, I added function(event) {
[14:14:45] <systemfault> cli: Your code is so messed up.. the only way I got it to show a popup was by doing that: jQuery('[id^="edit-field-facture-items-und-add-more--"]').on('click mousedown', function(e) { alert('lol'); return false; });
[14:14:49] <systemfault> It's crazy bad.
[14:15:15] <cli> well its enough
[14:15:20] <systemfault> I'd seriously consider changing job if I had to work on that pile of shit :(
[14:15:22] <cli> if that trigers its enough
[14:15:37] <cli> systemfault: thats what drupal comes with :(
[14:15:39] <systemfault> cli: You'll need to rebind it after it changes name
[14:15:40] <cli> sorry
[14:15:46] <cli> pff
[14:15:53] <cli> rebind?
[14:16:09] <systemfault> Rebind the event…
[14:16:20] <systemfault> redo that line again
[14:16:36] <cli> ahh ok thx a lot
[14:21:07] <cli> systemfault: to me that thing doesnt work at all, np I'll rewrite that module myself so I can alter/add the code how it should be thanks anyway
[14:23:38] <jonthanfielding> hello
[14:24:03] <jonthanfielding> I am trying to write a jQuery Plugin using jQuery Boilerplate and had a quick question
[14:25:02] <jonthanfielding> in the jQuery Boilerplate constructor it defines this.element however how  do I access things in the constructor
[14:30:00] <jonthanfielding> I think my problem is something todo with 'this' not equalling what I want it to be
[14:35:32] <amh345> is this valid?  $true_false_var = $some_var == $another_var     will $true_false_var be assign a value of true/false?
[14:37:01] <amh345> console says it's accurate..
[14:37:07] <amh345> bug must be elsewhere.
[14:39:04] <i_robot> Hello everybody!
[14:39:13] <cli> hi i_robot
[14:39:54] <i_robot> i came here to you a question to see if someone has already done something similar to this
[14:40:49] <i_robot> i'm currently working on a project where i should drag some div between fullscreen panels (normal divs)
[14:42:24] <i_robot> the window will have multiple fullscreen divs representing a panel where inside there is some divs with just text
[14:42:56] <i_robot> did someone already did something similar or have any ideas on how to do the transition?
[14:45:24] <i_robot> sorry to come here like that and ask you the question
[14:57:10] <scruz> if i set the html() of a jquery object both on load and in an event handler, what would cause the changes not to show up in the browser?
[14:59:43] <gotwig> does someone of you use gridster(.net) ?
[15:00:35] <Clex> gotwig: yup.
[15:03:32] <gotwig> Clex: you should checkout my project
[15:03:38] <gotwig> Clex: at www.draganddrool.tk
[15:04:07] <gotwig> Clex: Its also hosted on github.. https://github.com/gotwig/draganddrool
[15:04:50] <gotwig> Clex: do you know if there is a future for gridster?
[15:04:54] <gotwig> Clex: maybe could fork it
[15:05:30] <gotwig> to realize my project, I already got to modify some things, like adding a ready callbakc

[15:33:32] <lduros> hi, I'm trying to understand why you have to use this.each(); when you make a plugin. I'm not using it and I'm adding mouseenter/mouseleave events on the elements (multiple obj select) and it works fine on multiple elements.
[15:33:59] <lduros> in what instance is it need to use this.each version just doing this.on("event", function () {});
[15:34:13] <lduros> wouldn't it be overkill to add a listener using each?
[15:34:22] <lduros> and wasteful?
[15:35:22] <lduros> ah it's just to make it chainable?
[15:48:54] <goddard> lduros: sorry cant help never made a plugin

[16:08:30] <JesperA> coldhead no, i just want the first previus item it finds
[16:08:46] <coldhead> $(this).prevAll('.something:first')
[16:09:30] <JesperA> isnt :first just a css subselector or is it a jquery selector?
[16:12:16] <coldhead> it's jQUery

[16:49:40] <boytoy> my friend regarding zeptojs: "Personally, I'm not a fan of Zepto, as it it's a poor compromise between jQuery's incredible browser support, and just writing your own snappy vanilla JS."
[16:49:50] <boytoy> im trying to respond: Personally everything I do has to work on mobile. Soon the amount of mobile users will be double that of desktop users -- and after that, the distinction between desktop and mobile will slowly fade away. I was a bit put off by jQuery Mobile when I saw the way it imposed all the mess from jQuery UI on its users.
[16:49:56] <boytoy> + I might be a bit high on life after discovering Zepto, so sorry if I come off as too cocky. I just find the idea of Zepto being rewritten from scratch taking the best from jQuery and jQuery Mobile, but without all the bells and whistles, extremely pleasing to the senses. Like that French dude said, "Perfection is achieved, not when there's nothing left to add, but when there's nothing left to take away."
[16:50:04] <boytoy> what do you guys think? anything i should add to that? or remove?
[16:50:06] <anew> i want to wait for an image to load on the page - then load another div.  do i use isvisible ?
[16:50:08] <anew> for images ?
[16:51:42] <snover> I think you should delete all of it and replace it with “Zepto is shit and Thomas Fuchs is a dick”
[16:52:23] * boytoy guugles thomas fuchs
[16:52:45] <coldhead> boytoy: you should probably run it by the #zepto cheersquad
[16:52:48] <coldhead> assuming they exist
[16:52:57] <coldhead> it's not #jQuery's most beloved library
[16:53:01] <boytoy> coldhead: it's like 3 guys :/
[16:53:11] <chilversc> boytoy: doesn't basic jquery 1.9 work fine on mobile anyway?
[16:53:23] <coldhead> although i do admire the way it is a 100% jQuery compatible library which is faster and better in every way
[16:53:32] <coldhead> ONE HUNDRED PERCENT COMPATIBLE
[16:53:32] <boytoy> kewl
[16:53:36] <boytoy> haha
[16:53:38] <coldhead> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT jQUERY
[16:53:49] <boytoy> chilversc: i think so but it doesnt support mobile gestures and stuff
[16:53:52] <anew> well how would i wait for images to load
[16:53:53] <anew> with jq
[16:53:56] <anew> say i have 3 images in a div
[16:54:00] <anew> but they are above another div
[16:54:05] <anew> and i want the div below to load first
[16:54:08] <anew> which jq function is that ?
[16:54:38] <chilversc> boytoy: right, so I can't see the point in zepto as re-implementing jquery
[16:54:59] <coldhead> it's very simple. you take jQuery and you make it ALL BETTER
[16:55:05] <boytoy> chilversc: i guess they're just trying to do a fresh start
[16:55:07] <chilversc> boytoy: if you don't like jquery-mobile, you can use jquery + something else to get the extra parts you need?
[16:55:09] <coldhead> then you take jQuery into the back yard and shoot it
[16:55:36] <coldhead> and no one will even notice because it's 100% compatible. it's just that everything will be faster and better
[16:55:42] <chilversc> boytoy: but why? a fresh start here that just copies jquery seems a mistake to me
[16:55:52] <boytoy> chilversc: the closest to those extra parts i was able to get was http://jgestures.codeplex.com/ and it doesnt look too good. im also put off by the fact that jquery itself is willing to associate itself with something like jquery ui..
[16:56:10] <coldhead> lol
[16:56:36] <chilversc> boytoy: you could just not use jquery-ui
[16:56:39] <anew> can anyon help ?
[16:57:57] <crankharder> any alternatives to this? http://jpanelmenu.com/ looking for multiple panel support, left and right side.
[16:58:50] <boytoy> crankharder: yo was just working on that
[16:59:16] <anew> please jesus help me
[16:59:23] <boytoy> crankharder: some sweet lebanese chick rewrote it using css flexbox check it out -- https://gist.github.com/SaraSoueidan/4706668
[16:59:54] <boytoy> apparently the flexbox syntax has improved since she wrote it though
[17:00:09] <boytoy> crankharder: let us know if u make any improvements?
[17:01:52] <anew> boytoy can you help, i need to show images after another image loads
[17:02:13] <boytoy> anew: u mean like http://desandro.github.com/imagesloaded/ ?
[17:02:19] <sedeki> can someone take a look at this? I have two divs: #home (full opacity) and #step1 (opacity=0). When I click the button, it is supposed to fade out #home (works) and fade in #step1 (doesn't). http://213.103.197.143:8000/
[17:02:38] <sedeki> I have #step1 { opacity: 0; } if that helps
[17:02:46] <anew> hmmm boytoy can i tell the order of images to load with this ?
[17:03:08] <boytoy> dunno man
[17:05:54] <sedeki> got it working
[17:08:08] <voidpirate> hello
[17:08:59] <anew> so i'm sending an ajax request and not getting a status code back in consoel - and the link is red ?
[17:11:25] <lduros`> I have an image on a page, or any other element, and I want to figure out where there is more visible vertical screen above it or under it?
[17:11:53] <lduros`> by vertical space I mean whether the user sees more space (scrolled or not) above or under
[17:11:58] <lduros`> is there a way I can calculate this?
[17:13:31] <defaultro> hmm, i have an ajax and I added data. I'm troubleshooting it with this kind of code and it still fails.  data: { nvtcookie : <?php echo "test" ?> }   What's wrong with this?
[17:15:51] <jackjackw> can anybody help me with why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/cU2uj/15/
[17:16:04] <caseyburk> I'm trying to implement what I view as a function--but in jQuery / JavaScript, I think it's a class--to use for trimming strings on word boundaries. The code I have starts with "String.prototype.trunc =". How do I use this? I'm currently trying to use it by calling it via "$(this).trunc" but Firebug says it's not defined.
[17:18:16] <jackjackw> caseyburk: http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/#64
[17:18:59] <caseyburk> jackjackw: Thanks! I'll check that out. Looks like the exact thing I'm working on too. :)
[17:19:50] <defaultro> why this won't work?  data: { nvtcookie : <?php echo "test" ?> }
[17:23:13] <anew> not connected verify network" anyone know wtf to do with this error in ajax /
[17:24:03] <boytoy> crankharder: u there?
[17:24:35] <boytoy> just had a 2nd look at her code, i take back what i said
[17:24:52] <anew> jqXHR.status === 0
[17:24:57] <anew> this error anyone ?
[17:25:00] <boytoy> so yeah im looking for a jpanelmenu alternative too now
[17:26:09] <boytoy> oh lawdie lawd!!
[17:26:15] * boytoy sounds the alarm and flashes RED
[17:26:20] <boytoy> https://github.com/tegansnyder/Zepto-Mobile-Slide-Menu
[17:27:42] <anew> that's pretty awesome boytoy
[17:27:45] <anew> going to bookmark this
[17:28:17] <boytoy> same here :))
[17:34:45] <defaultro> got it working. had to enclose it with either quotes or doublequotes
[17:48:31] <bluepnume> Question: Would it be possible to have a script load in a document's <head>, and stop any subsequent javascript from running?
[17:49:41] <coldhead> interesting
[17:49:50] <coldhead> maybe you could have it look for and remove script tags
[18:04:08] <anew> can you help? i'm doing an ajax request and var_dump(); on the page to see what is being shown... but nothing is appearing in response ?
[18:04:14] <anew> how can i see the var_dump?
[18:04:16] <anew> i get 200 ok
[18:04:20] <anew> but no data shown
[18:16:08] <anew> can anyone help?
[18:16:14] <anew> the page should show something if i echo from it ?
[18:20:49] <defaultro> is there something wrong with my IE9, this doesn't seem to populate the value field. $('#tokenId').val(msgob.token); It works great with Firefox and Chrome
[18:21:48] <defaultro> target is <input id='tokenId' type='hidden' name='token' value='' />
[18:26:30] <goddard> can you check this out though http://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/E2bdR/5/
[18:26:37] <goddard> it is giving no error just not working
[18:27:09] <defaultro> alert doesn't even get called :(
[18:32:26] <lduros``> if I want to scroll the window to the bottom of a div (scrollTop), how can I calculate the number of pixels to scroll down to reach the bottom?
[18:32:39] <lduros``> I thought it would be $elem.offset() + $elem.height()
[18:33:53] <lduros``> $elem.offest().height maybe
[18:33:56] <defaultro> I found some answers but couldn't not understand what the person meant. He added 'value' : 'Clear' after Type
[18:34:55] <coldhead> couldn't not?
[18:35:35] <defaultro> hey coldhead. something is weird in IE. My .val is not working but works great in firefox and chrome
[18:36:15] <coldhead> that is weird
[18:36:23] <coldhead> i don't have an IE handy to test with
[18:36:36] <coldhead> but often that kind of behaviour happens if your markup is broken
[18:36:47] <defaultro> k
[18:36:48] <coldhead> chrome and fx do a better job of fixing it than ie
[18:36:53] <defaultro> i'm jsfiddling it
[18:37:11] <defaultro> can't let my code go this way because we have many users using IE
[18:38:21] <defaultro> i reproduced the error in jsfifle
[18:39:42] <defaultro> hhmm, it works in ie
[18:40:04] <coldhead> doctype?
[18:40:28] <defaultro> could it be because i am pulling the value from a webpage? It's not long enough to wait?
[18:40:42] <defaultro> i added async: false in my ajax though
[18:41:14] <coldhead> that sounds possible
[18:41:23] <defaultro> k
[18:41:31] <coldhead> and async: false is generally a bad idea
[18:41:33] <defaultro> I'm using success:
[18:41:36] <defaultro> oh
[18:42:33] <defaultro> can't get it to work :(
[18:42:37] <defaultro> damn ie
[18:43:05] <coldhead> chromeframe? :D
[18:43:14] <defaultro> but i can see it's calling the webpage from apache's access_log
[18:43:20] <defaultro> :)
[18:43:39] <defaultro> any ideas how to get it work?
[18:44:09] <defaultro> http://jsfiddle.net/4jdHr/1/
[18:44:16] <defaultro> that's how it's written
[18:44:29] <defaultro> that works though in my IE
[18:45:05] <coldhead> this code really should work in IE
[18:45:11] <coldhead> and i don't see your ajax stuff
[18:45:17] <coldhead> which may be where the trouble is
[18:45:30] <defaultro> I just recreated it to check whether .val works
[18:45:49] <coldhead> val() definitely works
[18:45:55] <coldhead> it would be the apocalypse if it didn't
[18:49:01] <defaultro> http://jsfiddle.net/GuYJr/1/
[18:49:17] <defaultro> not sure where to simulate my retrievetoken.php
[18:49:53] <coldhead> defaultro: if you're telling jquery to expect json, you shouldn't have to parseJSON yourself
[18:50:06] <coldhead> console.log( response ) should confirm it's already parsed for you
[18:50:22] <defaultro> i should remove datatype?
[18:50:39] <lduros``> is it possible to leave the mouse at the current position while doing $(document).scrollTop()? :)
[18:50:51] <coldhead> leave the datatype
[18:50:54] <coldhead> remove the parseJSON
[18:50:57] <coldhead> let jQUery do the work
[18:50:58] <defaultro> got it
[18:51:18] <coldhead> response.tokenvalue should suffice
[18:51:20] <defaultro> what would be the msgobj then?
[18:51:22] <defaultro> ah :D
[18:51:35] <coldhead> or msobj = response, if you don't want to rewrite as much
[18:51:41] <defaultro> it's ok
[18:51:45] <defaultro> thank you. I'll try it
[18:52:31] <defaultro> still fails in IE
[18:52:39] <coldhead> god damn
[18:52:47] <defaultro> i'll try in Fx
[18:52:50] <coldhead> does it still fail if you do .val('test test test')
[18:52:58] <defaultro> ooops, it now fails in Fx too
[18:53:09] <coldhead> ugh, clearly is not a good day for me to be any use
[18:53:11] * coldhead bows out
[18:56:46] <defaultro> oops, it's receiving string rather than object
[18:56:59] <defaultro> i did an json_encode though
[18:57:02] <defaultro> in php
[18:58:06] <defaultro> looks like datatype: json doesn't work
[18:59:51] <systemfault> Perhaps you didn't write it properly....
[19:00:01] <defaultro> http://jsfiddle.net/GuYJr/1/
[19:00:06] <defaultro> what is missing there?
[19:00:13] <systemfault> dataype ...
[19:00:26] <systemfault> It's about being able to read...
[19:00:40] <defaultro> LOL
[19:00:40] <systemfault> Computers cannot guess what you want it to do.
[19:00:41] <defaultro> :D
[19:00:43] <defaultro> hahaha
[19:00:48] <defaultro> thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[19:01:01] <defaultro> retesting now
[19:01:21] <coldhead> i think perl6 can guess what you mean
[19:01:35] <defaultro> it's still appearing as string and not an object
[19:01:53] <systemfault> dataType ?
[19:01:59] <defaultro> datatype
[19:02:10] <systemfault> It's dataType
[19:02:19] <defaultro> i wrote it like this, datatype : json
[19:02:24] <defaultro> it's case sensitve?
[19:02:32] <systemfault> Welcome to Javascript...
[19:02:38] <systemfault> Right
[19:02:45] <defaultro> oh no :)
[19:03:05] <defaultro> i got a different error, looks like it's working
[19:03:12] <coldhead> yay
[19:03:15] <defaultro> yep, it's an object now :D
[19:03:26] <systemfault> Congratulations.
[19:03:52] <defaultro> thank you so much! It works now again in Fx
[19:03:53] <coldhead> CONGRATULATIONS ON THE BIRTH OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL NEW OBJECT
[19:03:55] <defaultro> checking IE
[19:03:59] <defaultro> hahahha
[19:04:25] <defaultro> damn IE
[19:04:28] <defaultro> didn't work
[19:04:39] <coldhead> maybe you'd be happier in another career?
[19:06:26] <defaultro> damn IE, if I enable debuging, it works
[19:06:56] <coldhead> lolll
[19:07:02] <defaultro> :(
[19:07:27] <defaultro> now i'm going to stop debuggin
[19:08:02] <defaultro> :( it doesn't fail anymore, lol
[19:08:05] <defaultro> i'll close it
[19:09:02] <defaultro> damn, it failed again
[19:09:14] <defaultro> never fails in Fx or Chrome
[19:09:51] <defaultro> i'll introduce a delay
[19:14:29] <defaultro> running tcpdump on port 80 now :) response is empty
[19:14:48] <coldhead> !!!
[19:15:34] <defaultro> decodign packets now
[19:22:56] <defaultro> when I removed dataType, I started getting response in IE
[19:23:13] <defaultro> i'll restore parseJSON
[19:25:20] <crankharder> boytoy: see it now, really close with jpanel, not sure i want to re-write everything, also not sure how well supported flexbox is?
[19:26:56] <crankharder> kinda surprised there aren't other libs out there tho
[19:28:53] <enerel> help
[19:28:57] <enerel> need help
[19:33:14] <voidpirat> hello everyone
[19:34:41] <coldhead> GREAT TO SEE YOU voidpirat
[19:35:08] <coldhead> enerel, my friend: can you be more specific
[19:35:32] <enerel> hey coldhead hi nigga
[19:35:38] <coldhead> racist
[19:35:41] <coldhead> :)
[19:35:43] <enerel> lol
[19:35:54] <voidpirat> whoaa
[19:36:08] <voidpirat> anyone working on any cool projects?
[19:36:21] <coldhead> voidpirat: http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos/
[19:36:24] <Jellyg00se> a bottom that flies around the screen
[19:36:44] <defaultro> systemfault/coldhead, I am getting the value now from ajax in ie. I see it in alert. However, it's not putting the value to my <input ...> via .val
[19:36:46] <enerel> i have not done any websites recently
[19:37:17] <enerel> http://kefelon.com/upload/index.php bootstrap and jquery UI conflict i think
[19:37:27] <coldhead> defaultro: can you do ANYTHING with it? like maybe document.title = ur_val;
[19:37:39] <enerel> coldhead: when you click on LOGIN at the top there should bootstrap modal will appear
[19:37:46] <voidpirat> that is cool coldhead
[19:37:57] <voidpirat> I am more into front end web dev stuff
[19:38:06] <defaultro> coldhead, I'm sorry. Where do i put that?
[19:38:31] <coldhead> defaultro: inside the success handler
[19:38:34] <defaultro> just to see if it's going to update the title?
[19:38:37] <coldhead> at the point where .val() is failing
[19:38:39] <coldhead> yes
[19:38:41] <defaultro> k
[19:38:52] <coldhead> just to see if js can do anything with that value more useful than alert()
[19:39:13] <defaultro> k
[19:39:58] <defaultro> don't see any
[19:40:09] <coldhead> enerel: where is the code that opens the login modal?
[19:41:56] <voidpirat> Coldhead: how long did it take you to develop kaleidoscope
[19:42:13] <coldhead> prototype in an afternoon and a lot of people have made it better since
[19:42:18] <defaultro> my god, it worked after removing all the console.log
[19:42:27] <voidpirat> dang, I wish I was that good :(
[19:42:28] <defaultro> what the f
[19:42:31] <coldhead> oh defaultro, don't console.log on IE
[19:42:38] <defaultro> :(
[19:42:39] <coldhead> sorry, thought you knew that
[19:42:41] <coldhead> :P
[19:42:43] <defaultro> no :)
[19:42:48] <defaultro> what is wrong with Microsoft
[19:43:09] <coldhead> voidpirat: it's not that clever, i just had a couple of basic ideas that magically worked well together
[19:43:18] <coldhead> look at the first commit on github, it's teensy
[19:44:00] <defaultro> it's working really well now
[19:44:14] <coldhead> great!
[19:44:21] <coldhead> can you take out async: false?
[19:44:25] <enerel> coldhead: LOGIN link at the very top
[19:44:33] <defaultro> i think i did
[19:44:33] <coldhead> yes enerel, where is the JS
[19:44:40] <coldhead> you have 40 script files
[19:44:41] <voidpirat> Yeah I just never feel like I under stand JS lol
[19:44:44] <coldhead> i am not looking at all of them
[19:44:48] <voidpirat> I always get lost in cold, and don't understand it
[19:44:55] <coldhead> voidpirat: me either but i get by
[19:44:57] <voidpirat> code**
[19:45:03] <defaultro> it failed now after removing async false
[19:45:09] <coldhead> so put it back in :(
[19:45:14] <defaultro> yup
[19:45:23] <coldhead> let's draw a veil over this disgraceful episode, defaultro
[19:45:25] <voidpirat> I need a good book to read to get me started
[19:45:26] <coldhead> and never speak of it again
[19:45:28] <defaultro> works now again :D
[19:45:32] <enerel> it is top 3 row of <script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/custom.js"></script>
[19:45:40] <defaultro> learned a lot today :D
[19:45:44] <coldhead> voidpirat: : http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[19:45:47] <defaultro> this is nice troubleshooting day
[19:45:49] <coldhead> thanks enerel
[19:45:50] <defaultro> 4 hours man! :D
[19:45:58] <defaultro> now firefox is not working
[19:46:22] <voidpirat> I have this book now: http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Definitive-Guide-Activate-Guides/dp/0596805527/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1362969967&sr=8-2&keywords=javascript
[19:46:29] <defaultro> just kidding :D
[19:46:36] <defaultro> alright, playing with my kids now, hahaha
[19:46:44] <defaultro> i'll commit my changes later
[19:46:59] <voidpirat> hwo old is everyone?
[19:47:12] <coldhead> enerel: the start of this code, where you set attr('href', '#login_modal')
[19:47:31] <coldhead> does it work if you put that in the HTML in the first place? instead of changing it with JS on ready() ?
[19:47:49] <coldhead> have fun defaultro
[19:47:57] <coldhead> voidpirat: too damn old
[19:48:25] <voidpirat> 21 here :)
[19:48:36] <enerel> if i only use bootstrap without other JS it is working http://kefelon.com/upload/standalone
[19:49:11] <coldhead> enerel: so i think bootstrap must be running before .ready()
[19:49:23] <coldhead> so it doesn't see your jQuery changes that happen later
[19:50:17] <goddard> can you check this out though http://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/E2bdR/5/
[19:50:27] <enerel> http://kefelon.com/upload/index.php line 216 this is where modal start
[19:50:43] <goddard> it doesn't work and gives no error
[19:51:00] <coldhead> enerel: i think you need a way to say "hey bootstrap! i have new html! please reload!"
[19:51:05] <coldhead> enerel: i don't know how to do that
[19:51:40] <enerel> it is not conflict?
[19:52:54] <coldhead> kind of, enerel
[19:53:13] <coldhead> bootstrap finishes setting up, then jQuery changes your html, and bootstrap doesn't "see" your changes
[19:53:23] <coldhead> because it it already finished
[19:53:34] <coldhead> goddard: you need to use on() if you are adding the content later http://jsfiddle.net/E2bdR/7/
[19:53:50] <coldhead> goddard: you can't do a .click() handler for something that doesn't exist on the page yet
[19:55:52] <voidpirat> what is that script suppose to do?
[19:56:20] <coldhead> enerel: it MIGHT work if you put <script>$("#login_link").attr("href", "#login_modal").attr("data-toggle", "modal");</script> DIRECTLY after the html for the login link
[19:56:21] <coldhead> without .ready()
[19:56:21] <coldhead> that SHOULD run before bootstrap notices
[19:58:13] <goddard> coldhead: ahh i see and i also need $(document)
[19:58:23] <goddard> coldhead: thanks that will definately be good knowing
[19:59:03] <goddard> definitely

[20:03:26] <kk> who are you
[20:04:01] <chowder> what do you guys think I should charge? I said that $500 is what I had in mind. I think that's fair
[20:04:07] <kk> 你妹哦
[20:04:28] <kk> 有懂中文的吗

[20:05:28] <danheberden> chowder: decide your hourly rate. then figure out how many hours it will take to do it. then double that number.
[20:05:39] <danheberden> then multiply the hours by the hourly rate
[20:06:06] <chowder> danheberden, sounds like you've done this before!
[20:08:53] <crankharder> the panel docs mention that the panel element must not be inbetween header/content/footer roles.  does that mean those roles are required on the page?
[20:15:37] <enerel> coldhead: i got it
[20:28:26] <Foxhoundz> This question not directly related to jQuery, but here it goes: does anyone know of any web service that provides a sort of sandbox RESTful server to test out client side web apps?
[20:28:41] <Foxhoundz> Or rather, to learn making single-page JS apps?
[20:30:20] <crankharder> $('#panel-left').panel().... TypeError: Cannot read property 'options' of undefined
[20:30:25] <crankharder> any thoughts on why thats happening?
[20:32:44] <sample001> hello there i
[20:37:41] <syntaxe> I need to re-initilize (to trigger pageinit) the current active page in a jQuery mobile app, but $.mobile.activePage.trigger("create"); doesnt do this, it only reloads. How can i make it reinit the page?
[20:43:55] <syntaxe> Nevermind. Just going to use a little hack.
[20:46:03] <coldhead> good work enerel
[20:50:24] <crankharder> man... there's no init js on this page: http://api.jquerymobile.com/panel/#entry-examples
[20:50:34] <crankharder> what good is an example if it doesn't show how it works
[20:51:00] <danheberden> crankharder: because you only need to include jqm
[20:51:06] <danheberden> thus, the example
[20:51:18] <danheberden> of like "hey, look, you can just use data-* shit to declare how you want your page to look
[20:51:45] <crankharder> so much magic
[20:52:25] <crankharder> so if I have some element w/ data-role='panel' and jqm loaded, it should just work?
[20:52:56] <syntaxe> feel like jquery mobile could have better documentation
[20:53:02] <crankharder> yes. that.
[20:54:07] <syntaxe> examples are great, but all there data-* attributes are not allways as intuitive
[20:54:10] <coldhead> IF ONLY WE HAD ACCESS TO THE REPOSITORIES TO IMPROVE THE DOCUMENTATION WHERE WE FOUND IT LACKING
[20:54:14] <coldhead> /o\
[21:05:21] <defaultro> I'm back guys, kids are sleeping now :)
[21:12:22] <coldhead> great work defaultro
[21:14:53] <defaultro> :D thanks
[21:20:31] <RonWhoCares> This week I put ' Tiny Editor ' on my web site --- allowing the users to provide basic formatting when filling out certain fields.  As soon as I did this *all* the JQuery scripts on the site ceased working at the same time
[21:20:48] <RonWhoCares> Is there a way for JQuery and Tiny Editor to co-exist?
[21:22:30] <danheberden> RonWhoCares: did you re-include jQuery?
[21:22:30] <danheberden> somehow? someway?
[21:22:30] * danheberden queue's up barbara strisand song
[21:23:02] <coldhead> streisand*
[21:23:08] <coldhead> queues*
[21:23:31] <RonWhoCares> danheberden: No
[21:23:57] <defaultro> I've been testing the 3 browsers and I have not encountered any issues :)
[21:24:29] <RonWhoCares> danheberden: I only added the Tiny Editor lines
[21:24:44] <danheberden> RonWhoCares: what are those?
[21:25:08] <danheberden> coldhead what ever would i do without you
[21:25:22] <danheberden> i mean, whatever would i do with out you
[21:25:22] <RonWhoCares> danheberden: http://www.theverseoftheday.info/tools/tinyeditor/tiny.editor.packed.js"   This is the main line
[21:25:57] <defaultro> what's a nice minifier?
[21:27:05] <voidpirat> http://jscompress.com/
[21:27:20] <danheberden> defaultro: uglify
[21:27:40] <danheberden> defaultro: there's also a grunt plugin for it https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify
[21:28:10] <coldhead> is there a way to run grunt as a chrome extension?
[21:28:12] <coldhead> anyone?
[21:30:25] <defaultro> thanks
[21:33:29] <hazardous> can anyone rececommend a good tooltip that can load ajax
[21:33:34] <hazardous> a lot i've seen don't make work with the jq 1.9 don't know why
[21:36:57] <voidpirate> doesn't bootstrap have one?
[21:38:22] <hazardous> yeah but it uses data-something for the content
[21:38:32] <hazardous> i need to be able to apply tooltips that load a url and dump the content into the tooltip
[21:38:39] <hazardous> on a span or whatever, so it can't read off href=""
[21:38:53] <hazardous> what i'd like is closer to bootstrap's Popover actually
[21:38:56] <hazardous> in terms of style
[21:40:26] <hazardous> any suggestions? :L pretty much half of the google results are using like jq 1.4 or 1.5 or something and just throw weird warnings in webconsole after not working
[22:08:27] <voidpirate> chirp chirp
[22:17:08] <sehh> hey there
[22:18:04] <sehh> quick question: When I use the "beforeShowDay" event, even if it is an empty function, I see whatever default text I have set in my <input value="default text">
[22:18:22] <sehh> erm, the <input> is a datepicker
[22:18:58] <sehh> which is strange, since beforeShowDay is about highlighting selected dates etc, so why does it remove my default input value?
[22:23:19] <coldhead> it's a bitter mystery huh
[22:23:28] <sehh> :)
[22:24:22] <sehh> is it a known issue or did I stumble on an unknown bug?
[22:48:02] <crankharder> any ideas why this doesn't work on the ios simulator?
[22:48:02] <crankharder>   $('body').on('click', '*', function(e){console.log(e)}
[22:50:50] <coldhead> sometimes i wish for a short way home
[22:51:41] <tw2113> for once, i have a question
[22:51:54] <coldhead> sure you do, suuure you do
[22:52:08] <tw2113> i'm trying to attach a blur func to a google custom search
[22:52:26] <tw2113> and i know i have it targeted right
[22:52:44] <tw2113> but the blur() code isn't running
[22:53:01] <tw2113> and i suspect it's because the google search input is being imported in
[22:53:39] <tw2113> my hunch is thinking i need to hook on via bind() or so
[22:53:57] <tw2113> eh, maybe on() instead
[22:54:14] <coldhead> great work, tw2113
[22:54:17] <coldhead> good luck
[22:54:48] <tw2113> eh, this site has old jQuery, just remembered
[22:54:55] <tw2113> so pre-on methods would actually work
[22:55:07] <coldhead> livequery <3
[22:56:44] <coldhead> tw2113: if you found #jQuery helped you with your problem today please consider making a donation
[22:56:57] <coldhead> http://jquery.org/donate/
[22:56:59] <tw2113> sucks because i had this working via firebug console, but that was being run after the form was loaded
[22:57:00] <tw2113> no donation for you!
[22:57:01] <tw2113> i haven't been properly helped yet
[22:57:13] <tw2113> you've just been a yes man :P
[22:57:32] <coldhead> i certainly valued my input
[22:57:46] <grafi> so do i
[22:58:39] <tw2113> maybe i should load this part in the footer
[23:00:09] <tw2113> nope, that takes me a step back oddly
[23:01:33] <coldhead> try typing the URL backwards
[23:02:54] <tw2113> don't be snatching my straws
[23:21:26] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's take a 45 minute break
[23:25:09] <abjorn> coldhead: Can I make mine an 8-9 hour break?
[23:25:23] <coldhead> i think you've earned it
[23:25:32] <abjorn> ballin'
[23:26:20] <coldhead> sweet dreams, babe
[23:26:44] <abjorn> good night fair coldhead
[23:27:24] * coldhead goes to sleep
