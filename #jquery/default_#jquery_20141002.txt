[00:00:00] <doug_> http://jsfiddle.net/Ly3e462c/3/
[00:01:56] <Cork> i get irks when i see type conversions through ! though
[00:02:06] <doug_> I screwed around with weirdness until I realized that .empty was taken. Once I used isEmpty it was ok. for example: http://jsfiddle.net/Ly3e462c/4/
[00:02:22] <doug_> Cork: do you? what types were you expecting length to be
[00:02:32] <Cork> doug_: heh, why do you think i picked isEmpty :)
[00:03:06] <Cork> doug_: well what if this didn't have the array prototype?
[00:03:33] <doug_> it's an extension method
[00:03:46] <doug_> this will always be a jq right?
[00:03:48] <Cork> doug_: i find > 0 or < 1 less misleading
[00:03:58] <Cork> doug_: sure, but for readability
[00:04:15] <Cork> you can't misinterpret < 1
[00:04:31] <Cork> but !variable can be (is this a string?, number? boolean? what?)
[00:05:04] <Cork> sure length is quite rigid in what it should be
[00:05:14] <Cork> but it is still based on assumptions
[00:05:31] <doug_> < 1 is still eligible for implicit conversion
[00:05:45] <Cork> doug_: the problem isn't in what the code does
[00:05:53] <Cork> it is in what it tells the developer
[00:06:05] <Cork> like i said readability
[00:06:43] <Cork> < 1 tells the developer "here the number is checked if it is more then one"
[00:06:56] <Cork> instead of "we typecast something and see if it is falsy"
[00:07:03] <doug_> ===0 would probably be ideal, if you use my argument that "it's always a jq so length is always a number" argument
[00:07:19] <Cork> doug_: that is ok too
[00:07:38] <Cork> but there my old assembler history kicks in :)
[00:07:43] <doug_> s/ argument$//
[00:07:50] <Cork> "never assume a number can't go passed what you expect"
[00:08:04] <JBlitzen> past
[00:08:20] <Cork> so i never check test == max
[00:08:28] <Cork> or min for that matter
[00:08:50] <Cork> but ya, it's mostly just paranoia
[00:09:08] <Cork> it would be very weird is an array became negative :)
[00:09:10] <doug_> https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCIQyCkwAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DN4vf8N6GpdM&ei=9fksVNuIMo6cygTN6YGwBQ&usg=AFQjCNEv9XntJIEBcjnO7Xmi3Rxg7h4QyA&bvm=bv.76477589,d.aWw
[00:18:03] <doug_> Cork: do you use angularjs?
[00:18:09] <Cork> no
[00:18:09] <doug_> just curious
[00:20:29] <doug_> Cork: I have that same paranoia of value ranges... but C++'s iterators mostly broke me of that, checking iter != collection.end() instead of <
[00:21:06] <Cork> doug_: well itterators is another matter
[00:21:16] <Cork> as there you check if the pointers are the same
[00:21:44] <doug_> and I often have a "let it crash because I want to find every bug" attitude instead of putting little checks here or there
[00:21:51] <doug_> but yes defensive programming is good too
[00:22:35] <Cork> doug_: crash is good as long as the value is problematic
[00:22:53] <Cork> a number jumping past what you expected is not really though
[00:24:42] <doug_> Cork: do you use yeoman or grunt or any templating systems or MVC frameworks of some kind?
[00:24:59] <doug_> just curious
[00:25:08] <Cork> doug_: for js templating i use quint
[00:25:23] <Cork> serverside i use what the framework expects
[00:25:55] <Cork> the backends we use here is golang, rails and python
[00:26:18] <Cork> but we're moving more and more over to go
[00:26:29] <Cork> cause rails is just too slow
[00:30:56] <doug_> cool
[00:35:34] <doug_> Cork: anything against angularjs?
[00:36:22] <Cork> doug_: not really
[00:36:36] <Cork> i just don't normally need those
[00:36:46] <Cork> i find plain js does what i need
[00:37:23] <Cork> and i prefer being able to freely adjust to what the environment needs
[00:37:35] <Cork> instead of getting locked down to what a framework expects
[00:37:46] <Cork> (reducing dependencies)
[00:46:30] <uberjar> Hi.  Is there a way to get a function callback after append() ?
[00:46:44] <uberjar> I need to do something *after* append() finishes
[00:46:53] <Cork> uberjar: append isn't async
[00:46:57] <Cork> just run it on the next line
[00:46:59] <uberjar> Cork: I beg to differ
[00:47:06] <uberjar> Cork: append() IS synchronous, but the DOM update is not
[00:47:08] <Cork> append isn't async
[00:47:17] <uberjar> I need the thing to runafter the DOM update
[00:47:21] <Cork> uberjar: but you might do something like <img> or <iframe>
[00:47:27] <Cork> and THOSE will be async
[00:47:49] <uberjar> Cork: I'm just inserting a div, yeah with image content and whatnot
[00:47:50] <Cork> if you want to catch those you need to bind load event handlers on the dom element your interested in
[00:48:06] <Cork> uberjar: you will have to bind an event handler for each element
[00:48:24] <uberjar> Cork: what about just inserting divs ? will that be syncronous
[00:48:36] <uberjar> is it only img and iframe that load async after append() ?
[00:48:38] <Cork> uberjar: adding dom elements of any form is syncronus
[00:48:40] <uberjar> thanks for your help btw
[00:48:49] <Cork> things that has src attributes
[00:48:52] <Cork> will be async
[00:49:10] <uberjar> I see.
[00:49:13] <Cork> or rather loading content into elements with src attributes
[00:49:40] <Cork> uberjar: something that might make things simpler is something like
[00:50:20] <Cork> var dom = $(html); dom.find('img, iframe, object').on('load', handler); $(target).append(dom);
[00:51:48] <uberjar> Cork: I'm inserting a bunch of divs and then I want to measure their height after they are loaded.. some of those divs contain images
[00:52:07] <uberjar> should I expect to not be able to get an accurate height measurement until after all images haveloaded ?
[00:52:17] <Cork> yes
[00:52:33] <Cork> unless the <img> tags has a specified height attribute/css value
[00:53:00] <Cork> cause then the browser has to load part of the image before it can know the dimensions
[00:53:35] <uberjar> got it.  well thanks that clairifies...  thats an easier proble to deal with.. detecting image loads
[00:56:00] <litropy> Cork, are you a jQ dev?
[00:56:31] <Cork> litropy: nope
[00:56:59] <litropy> Cork, so you've just been working with jQuery for years? Seems like you've known it since its inception.
[00:57:35] <Cork> litropy: started with native js, then got forced to use prototype for about 2 years
[00:57:54] <Cork> then i stubbled over jquery (1.0 at the time)
[00:58:24] <Cork> i hated prototype with a vengeance so pushed hard to move to jq
[00:58:28] <Cork> and been here since :)
[00:58:39] <Cork> i don't even know if there existed a release before 1.0
[00:59:45] <Cork> litropy: what made me puke over prototype was that you had to put checks for every freaking thing
[00:59:56] <Cork> cause everything returned undefined if something wasn't found
[01:00:10] <Cork> the core idea of jquery is to silently handle those cases
[01:01:03] <Cork> litropy: been using extjs a bit too
[01:01:14] <Cork> but it makes my eyes bleed
[01:01:36] <Cork> they have basically reimplemented java in javascript
[01:01:43] <litropy> Cork, hmm ... I haven't used any js lib except for jQ. Can you give me an example of how you don't have to check something with jQ?
[01:01:49] <Cork> it is ridiculously hard to extend
[01:02:20] <Cork> litropy: $('#id-that-does-not-exist').on('click', handle);
[01:02:58] <litropy> Cork, it would just pass over that without even throwing an error?
[01:03:14] <Cork> if prototype it is var elm = $$('id-that-does-not-exist); if(elm !== undefined) { elm.on('click', handle'); }
[01:03:15] <JBlitzen> It adds the handler to every element returned by that selector
[01:03:20] <Cork> litropy: yes
[01:03:24] <litropy> Cork, nice.
[01:03:24] <JBlitzen> So it does work
[01:03:35] <Cork> litropy: jquery always return a jquery object
[01:03:45] <Cork> if the selector doesn't match the object is just empty
[01:04:10] <Cork> so when .on wants to bind the handler it does this.each({ this.addEventListener })
[01:04:18] <Cork> but as it is empty no loop
[01:04:23] <Cork> (psudo code)
[01:04:43] <litropy> Nice.
[01:04:43] <Cork> so you get not found handling for free basically
[01:06:27] <JBlitzen> Put another way, an empty array is still an array
[01:06:43] <Cork> litropy: it is very nice, cause you can easily write adaptive javascript
[01:06:54] <doug_> $.fn.annoyCork = function() { return this.length === 0 ? undefined : this; }; $('#not-exist').annoyCork().on('click', function() {});
[01:06:57] <litropy> JBlitzen, right. So you're still grabbing a bit of RAM, but it's not much.
[01:07:04] <Cork> instead of rigid, that has to be modified for every single tiny dom change
[01:07:10] <JBlitzen> Don't even think about RAM at that level
[01:07:23] <Cork> doug_: lol
[01:07:35] <JBlitzen> Performance within jquery is negligible next to the HTTP overhead stuff
[01:07:47] <JBlitzen> You only get into issues when navigating the DOM
[01:07:56] <JBlitzen> Optimize your selectors or simplify your DOM and you'll be fine
[01:08:14] <JBlitzen> It's the file downloads and sizes that you have to worry about
[01:08:28] <JBlitzen> 20-file uncompressed plugin is no good no matter how fast it runs
[01:08:46] <JBlitzen> Particularly nasty since you won't notice it testing locally
[01:09:13] <Cork> litropy: the empty array overhead is negligible, there is a cost though
[01:09:35] <Cork> litropy: jquery results in quite a few objects getting created for normal workflow
[01:09:44] <Cork> and when those then gets released
[01:09:53] <Cork> it causes quite a bit of gc
[01:10:00] <Cork> it is the biggest problem with jq
[01:10:22] <JBlitzen> For that matter, javascript itself isn't a paragon of performance
[01:10:30] <doug_> gc is always a problem if present :)
[01:10:32] <Cork> but unless you need to do high performance code (and you normally don't) it doesn't matter
[01:10:41] <Cork> JBlitzen: it can be actually
[01:10:53] <JBlitzen> Anything can be
[01:11:10] <Cork> 1/2 speed of c is quite good compared to most script language
[01:11:13] <doug_> the overhead of gc is worth it
[01:11:34] <JBlitzen> Maybe once it's interpreted
[01:11:35] <Cork> for example it runs laps around ruby
[01:11:41] <Cork> *jited
[01:11:51] <Cork> yes jit matters
[01:11:55] <litropy> JBlitzen, yah, I've only got single file plugins going at that. touchSwipe and ... ugh my server isn't responding right now. But it patches jquery to use getAnimationFrame, and it's wonderful. Anyhow, I'm well under 100k with all my js.
[01:12:04] <JBlitzen> nod
[01:12:08] <Cork> JBlitzen: but i talk about jitted js compared to jitted ruby
[01:12:22] <litropy> What's gc?
[01:12:25] <JBlitzen> I'm working on a relatively large project with probably 6,000+ lines of custom javascript
[01:12:29] <Cork> Garbage Collection
[01:12:37] <litropy> THis happens on unload?
[01:12:38] <JBlitzen> Only performance issues are from file loading and poor selector optimization
[01:12:49] <JBlitzen> Rest of it's smooth as silk
[01:12:59] <JBlitzen> Even on this shitty old dev box I refuse to upgrade
[01:13:04] <doug_> litropy: you only have to worry about it when optimizing
[01:13:08] <JBlitzen> New machines hide so many performance issues
[01:13:11] <Cork> litropy: it is a process in the language that walks references in the language looking for memory allocations not referenced by anything
[01:13:22] <Cork> litropy: and frees memory nothing points to
[01:13:32] <Cork> litropy: there is also cc
[01:13:45] <litropy> Cork, when? At set intervals?
[01:13:46] <Cork> that walks the reference chain looking for reference cycles
[01:13:51] <Cork> litropy: yes
[01:14:01] <litropy> I see.
[01:14:12] <Cork> litropy: the reason gc is a performance concern
[01:14:19] <Cork> is cause when the gc or cc needs to work
[01:14:26] <Cork> it has to frees the process
[01:14:32] <Cork> so if you create much work for them
[01:14:39] <Cork> it takes long times to do the work
[01:14:52] <Cork> and you get lag effects in animations for example
[01:15:15] <doug_> where "long times" is milliseconds or tens of milliseconds
[01:15:38] <litropy> I'm selecting in cases. If I'm on page1 then $("#idthatsonlyonpage1").stuff
[01:15:42] <Cork> well normally if it wakes ~ 6ms or more
[01:16:01] <Cork> sorry
[01:16:04] <Cork> 16ms not 6
[01:16:12] <Cork> (1000/60)
[01:16:32] <Cork> wakes == takes
[01:16:41] <doug_> 16 2/3 ms ;)
[01:16:46] <Cork> lol
[01:17:01] <Cork> well the work to actually generate the next frame needs to have some time too
[01:17:19] <Cork> if gc + cc + code to generate next frame == lag
[01:17:23] <Cork> opps
[01:17:30] <litropy> YAh actually, now that I think about it, in my 1400 lines of code, I'm pretty sure I don't select a div that's not there.
[01:17:33] <Cork> if gc + cc + code to generate next frame > 16 ½ ms == lag
[01:18:03] <litropy> ... and I realize I could probably cut the number of lines my code is in half if I were "better"
[01:18:54] <Cork> so performance sensitive js often go to long length to avoid to release/allocate memory
[01:19:08] <litropy> Only a couple or three if ($("#mydiv").length) {}
[01:19:10] <Cork> reusing arrays, and avoiding objects and so on
[01:19:35] <Cork> litropy: i rarely use ids in the code
[01:19:50] <mooncup> whyso Cork?
[01:19:51] <Cork> only for things that by definition can only exist once
[01:20:04] <Cork> mooncup: cause then you write actions instead of static handling
[01:20:22] <mooncup> aren't ids way faster than classes for jquery to find?
[01:20:27] <Cork> no
[01:20:28] <mooncup> or does it not make too much difference?
[01:20:35] <Cork> it is a little faster
[01:20:49] <litropy> Cork, yah you got me looking at $.closest() and the like
[01:20:56] <Cork> but for 99% of all js it is so little difference that it doesn't matter
[01:21:29] <litropy> Cork, not exactly sure what you mean by 'actions'
[01:21:36] <Cork> mooncup: id > class >>> element >>>>>>>>>>>>> attribute >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> :contains
[01:22:05] <Cork> litropy: trying to think of a good example
[01:22:16] <doug_> if you want speed, worry about reflows
[01:22:25] <Cork> ya
[01:22:31] <Cork> reflow can kill most anything
[01:22:43] <Cork> and is something you should care about as number one
[01:22:52] <Cork> even before network load time
[01:23:57] <litropy> Cork, any way to do if ( $(this).attr("id") === 'myid' ) {}; //more efficiently?
[01:24:00] <Cork> litropy: for example instead of $('#form-id').on('submit', function() { $('#name-field').val() !== '' })
[01:24:17] <Cork> litropy: this.id == 'myid'
[01:24:43] <litropy> Cork, is less resource-heavy?
[01:24:50] <litropy> that^
[01:25:14] <Cork> litropy: $('form.ajax').on('submit', function() { $('.require.not-blank').each(function() { $(this).val() !== ''; }); })
[01:25:32] <Cork> lost of separation and actual real code missing there
[01:26:05] <Cork> but basically instead of "find element x and on action y of check if its child z is empty"
[01:26:46] <Cork> litropy: you bind for all forms of type ajax (or validate) check if there is a child with the class required and not-blank
[01:26:56] <ivanovjaroslaw> Hello! I have an error with $.ajax and send json file. When I create an object with some fields and send it from AJAX to server in headers of request Content-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8. But when I create object with nested arrays - Content-Type:text/html; charset=utf-8. Why it text/html?
[01:26:59] <Cork> and if there is mark things invalid
[01:27:08] <litropy> Cork, I see.
[01:27:11] <Cork> litropy: then the html controls what js does by setting and removing classes
[01:27:23] <Cork> and js just sits there as actors
[01:27:32] <Cork> based on the requests by the elements
[01:27:56] <Cork> now days you should prob use the html form validator attributes though
[01:28:15] <Cork> (i actually used code quite close to that way before form validator attributes existed)
[01:28:33] <litropy> Cork, yep, I've got a bit of that going on. I'm adding data-values="" to many of my elements.
[01:28:44] <Cork> litropy: same here
[01:28:59] <Cork> litropy: a few years back i went to the next step :)
[01:29:04] <Cork> no dynamic js what so ever
[01:29:26] <Cork> inline eval is actually forbidden with csp in my later projects
[01:29:56] <Cork> so everything that should happen on the page is basically controlled by data- attributes and classes
[01:30:22] <ivanovjaroslaw> Oh, i am wrong
[01:30:31] <Cork> what i didn't expect when i did that transmission was the vast improvement in maintainability and performance
[01:31:44] <litropy> Cork, yep I certainly started with that on my current project, but I just couldn't wrap my head around it when I started doing functions within animation complete.
[01:32:07] <litropy> Cork, so it's a melding of both schools now.
[01:32:08] <Cork> litropy: i don't use $.animate at all
[01:32:18] <litropy> Cork, but it's pretty lol
[01:32:52] <Cork> litropy: you can do close to all of it with css3 animate and transision
[01:33:08] <Cork> and animations shouldn't ever be important enough that you would have to have fallback js code for it
[01:33:42] <Cork> litropy: the one situation where i sometime break that is if height need to be animated
[01:33:46] <Cork> as css can't do that
[01:34:20] <Cork> or specifically can't do that if height is auto
[01:34:43] <litropy> Cork, is CSS3 GPU-accelerated by default on relatively current browsers?
[01:34:53] <Cork> litropy: yes
[01:35:06] <Cork> as long as the gpu and drivers can handle rendering webpages
[01:35:15] <Cork> a lot of older drivers/gpus is blacklisted
[01:35:23] <Cork> cause they crash if the browser try to use them
[01:35:51] <Cork> so lot of users only have cpu animations
[01:36:04] <Cork> gamers is normally ok :)
[01:36:41] <litropy> Nice. But ... hm. What if an element isn't in the DOM yet, then needs to animate as soon as it enters the DOM? Do you use JS to tell CSS to use its animation?
[01:37:01] <Cork> litropy: yes
[01:37:07] <Cork> you add it with a class
[01:37:14] <Cork> then do .height() on it
[01:37:18] <Cork> and then remove the class
[01:37:24] <Cork> wala css animations
[01:37:41] <Cork> (height() is to trigger reflow in the browser)
[01:37:51] <litropy> Cork, so what's so bad about $.animate?
[01:38:00] <Cork> litropy: it is all js
[01:38:19] <Cork> it in a setInterval loop (~10ms if i remember correctly)
[01:38:23] <Cork> modifies the dom value
[01:38:36] <Cork> and "hopes" the browser will draw a frame close to when they did the change
[01:38:43] <litropy> Cork, I patched that. I'm using makeAnimationFrame.
[01:38:54] <Cork> that makes it much better
[01:39:08] <Cork> but you still do dom mutations that css doesn't have to do
[01:39:20] <Cork> and it still isn't hw accelerated
[01:39:29] <Cork> ever
[01:39:42] <litropy> Odd. I could have sworn I was reading that it was.
[01:40:04] <Cork> requestAnimationFrame syncs the change with the browsers drawing of the frame
[01:40:12] <Cork> but the changes isn't
[01:40:17] <Omar-> good morning
[01:40:31] <Cork> it can't be as the browser doesn't KNOW what has changed
[01:40:37] <Cork> or is going to change
[01:40:39] <litropy> Cork, that's the one - requestAnimationFram, not make
[01:41:04] <Cork> *but the changes isn't hw accelerated
[01:43:31] <litropy> Cork, so, to replicate $.animate's complete function, use $.when(css animation stuff).done(complete stuff)?
[01:43:51] <Cork> no
[01:44:06] <Cork> you could use the transisionend event
[01:44:10] <Cork> but not deferred
[01:46:56] <litropy> I see.
[01:53:24] <litropy> Cork, so, without a listener and browser type consideration, it's like: $(".moveright").css({'animation-duration': '5s', 'from':'{left:0}','to':'{left:20px}'}) ?
[01:53:53] <Cork> eh...
[01:54:04] <Cork> litropy: i don't have css in my js
[01:54:13] <Bauer> if I have this setting in .ajax: success: returnFunc, - how do I adjust it, so that I could pass a parameter to the returnFunc? currently it is only function onAjaxSuccess_json(response){
[01:54:14] <Cork> i add that to a css class
[01:54:31] <litropy> I see.
[01:54:31] <Cork> and then i do .addClass('other-state-name')
[01:54:51] <Cork> and for much it is just things like :active
[01:54:55] <Cork> or :hover
[01:55:22] <Cork> Bauer: check the context option
[01:55:44] <Bauer> Cork: what do you mean? whose context?
[01:55:56] <Cork> ?g api.jqeury.com ajax
[01:55:57] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.ajax() | jQuery API Documentation â†’ http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[01:58:03] <Bauer> Cork: good stuff, so I add it like context: customObj. but how would I accesss it from function onAjaxSuccess_json(response){?
[01:58:22] <Cork> Bauer: this.proprty_name
[01:58:29] <Cork> property*
[02:07:54] <Bauer> Cork: its nice, there is $(this) object with all the stuff I need, but when I try $(this).userType - I get undefined... why?
[02:08:14] <Cork> why would you need $()?
[02:08:52] <Bauer> hmmm, good point :D I just assumed to continue what I used so far
[02:08:55] <Bauer> in other places
[02:09:07] <Cork> function handler() { this.key1; this.key2 }; $.ajax(url, { context: { key1: 1, key2: 2 } }).done(handler);
[02:09:28] <Cork> Bauer: the reason you use $(this) in event handlers is cause this is a dom element there
[02:10:17] <Bauer> I see.. thanks! :)
[02:10:42] <bloodyscythe> ...doesn't Akuma mean demon in japanese? =.=
[02:10:46] <d0de> I have some code that needs an array with several thousand values in it. What's the best / cleanest / most maintainable way to write and package this code? I have very little experience with this kind of thing
[02:13:20] <Cork> bloodyscythe: devil not deamon
[02:13:32] <bloodyscythe> same difference :P
[02:13:41] <Cork> there is a difference actually
[02:14:06] <nielsnl> Hello all, does someone has an nice suggestion to to enhance the selection CSS for the selectable widget? I have a colored div matrix where you can select seats But the selection color is deficult to see,
[02:14:19] <Cork> bloodyscythe: akuma=devil oni=deamon
[02:14:33] <nielsnl> I was thinking about some sort of border?
[02:14:58] <bloodyscythe> I guess the anime I've watched was translated poorly then ;)
[02:15:22] <Cork> nielsnl: try rephrasing that, it doesn't make any sense
[02:15:34] <bloodyscythe> nielsnl, what about a color that has more contrast to the other color?
[02:15:35] <nielsnl> Okey
[02:16:09] <nielsnl> I have a grid of div's that are selectable
[02:16:52] <nielsnl> The div's have multiple background colors.
[02:17:52] <nielsnl> My question is of there is a nice solution to show the selected div's other then just changing the backgound color?
[02:18:13] <bloodyscythe> moving it up some pixels and make a drop shadow?
[02:18:40] <Cork> nielsnl: you can set a border, add image, shadow
[02:18:47] <Cork> rounding
[02:18:55] <Cork> depends on what effect you want
[02:20:53] <nielsnl> i was thinking of the border and shadow, but when  you select multipe div's how do i show them nicely so that not every div got the border surrounded?
[02:20:58] <bloodyscythe> also, I've heard that there is a #css channel, you might wanna visit
[02:22:01] <bloodyscythe> nielsnl, you can add some spacing between the divs then
[02:22:09] <Cork> nielsnl: also the questions is more esoteric then "how do i" that these channels are normally aimed for
[02:22:16] <nielsnl> bloodyscythe: i know, i hoped that someone here already trough about it ;)
[02:22:49] <Cork> you might have to get paid help from a ux designed or graphic designer if you want help how it should look
[02:23:54] <bloodyscythe> there's a job called ux designer? =.=
[02:24:01] <Cork> sure
[02:24:04] <Cork> we have one here :)
[02:24:05] <bloodyscythe> I think I have to do that
[02:24:26] <Cork> some companies has a ux department
[02:24:55] <bloodyscythe> *interested*
[02:26:25] <jop008> Hi anyone used icomoon icons ?
[02:26:41] <jop008> I can't find an example with how to use it
[02:26:56] <bloodyscythe> Cork, do you know where to learn ux designing?
[02:27:07] <Cork> no
[02:27:19] <bloodyscythe> k thanks :/

[02:57:22] <litropy> Man, CSS has gotten weird.
[02:57:38] <Cork> litropy: wait until you start looking at variables :)
[02:57:48] <bloodyscythe> css now has variables? :O

[02:58:14] <bloodyscythe> stahp plis, dis is getting weird
[03:01:55] <bloodyscythe> Cork, this is horrible
[03:02:01] <Cork> lol
[03:02:17] <mooncup> javascript will be obselete at this rate
[03:02:32] <Cork> lol
[03:02:41] <Cork> mooncup: position: sticky; :)
[03:03:06] <bloodyscythe> I don't wanna live on this firefox anymore
[03:03:24] <Cork> but yes, the are working hard on adding css for common javascript schemas
[03:03:45] <Cork> the latest i've seen is work trying to add scroll position support to css
[03:05:01] <mooncup> sweet
[03:06:42] <bloodyscythe> looks like they got bored and did something before doing nothing
[03:06:42] <Cork> mooncup: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2014Sep/0391.html
[03:08:28] <litropy> Alright, I just read the whole MDN on variables. I feel violated. But I like it.
[03:13:40] <Cork> lol
[03:14:06] <Cork> litropy: what scares me is the spec specifies that js could get access to these variables
[03:14:29] <Cork> so you could add js in css and then use the js for polyfill
[03:14:58] <Cork> luckily noone has implemented it yet as far as i know
[03:15:11] <Cork> (and i hope no one will)
[03:15:46] <litropy> Cork, yah I'm running through the test cases and it's failed in every case for Chrome 35.0.1916.153 (WebKit 537.36) on Linux i686
[03:16:07] <litropy> ... although, maybe my browser needs to be updated.
[03:16:13] <Cork> litropy: chrome has it behind a pref
[03:16:27] <litropy> Ah.
[03:16:29] <Cork> firefox is the only one that has gotten it to release yet
[03:16:44] <litropy> Anyhow, yick.
[03:16:50] <Cork> it was almost hitting alpha before the speck landed
[03:16:59] <Cork> *spec
[03:17:28] <Cork> they changed the spec from --var-name to --name like 3-4 days before it hit firefox alpha
[03:18:11] <litropy> Cork, I don't know if I can grasp how to transfer $.animate to CSS for my current project. I might have to try that for the next one.
[03:18:34] <litropy> I've got too many things dependent upon widths and heights.
[03:19:02] <Cork> litropy: ya
[03:19:15] <Cork> moving from js animations to css ones is complicated
[03:19:23] <Cork> or rather often complicated
[03:19:38] <litropy> It's really too bad, though - I'd love me some hardware accel.
[03:22:39] <litropy> Cork, I'm doing a slider. Is $("#myslidescontainingdiv").animate(positional css) going to be smoother than $(".slide").each(positional css)?
[03:23:11] <Cork> litropy: not sure what the later means
[03:23:19] <Cork> you mean call animate in an each loop?
[03:23:56] <litropy> Cork, yes. Either I'm animating the div containing the slides, or I'm animating each slide itself.
[03:24:25] <Cork> litropy: hard to tell
[03:24:44] <Cork> it can go either way
[03:25:02] <Cork> litropy: there are performans tools in both chrome and firefox
[03:25:09] <Cork> use it and see what performs best
[03:25:14] <litropy> thx
[03:30:35] <bloodyscythe> I'd say it's more efficient to animate the div, not the single slides, but I could be wrong
[03:35:37] <hypfer_office> okay, so now that I have my values I want to basically form an xml out of them and trigger a download. how can I do that? its all client side.
[03:41:58] <Cork> hypfer_office: you can generate a blob and set as href for an <a> tag
[03:42:05] <Cork> hypfer_office: but you can't trigger it
[03:42:09] <Cork> the user has to click
[03:43:53] <bloodyscythe> can anyone tell me what's the difference between jQ and jQ UI? is the UI a framework based on jQ?
[03:45:57] <hypfer_office> Cork: 100% sure about that? because the xml is generated by clicking a button. I dont want 2 presses
[03:47:52] <Cork> hypfer_office: quite
[03:48:07] <Cork> though it could have changed since last i checked
[03:48:17] <hypfer_office> so now I have some xml which I can output via alert
[03:48:25] <Cork> hypfer_office: the thing was that you couldn't trigger the click from js
[03:48:53] <Cork> but if you want you could try
[03:49:18] <hypfer_office> maybe.. put to clipboard?
[03:49:26] <Cork> that is even harder
[03:49:41] <Cork> then you have to get the user to whitelist your site for clipboard access
[03:49:45] <hypfer_office> damn
[03:49:47] <Cork> (i know firefox and ie has it)
[03:49:56] <hypfer_office> can I just write the xml to a new open tab?
[03:49:59] <Cork> firefox is complex as you need to fiddle in about:config
[03:50:17] <Cork> hmm
[03:50:20] <Cork> possibly?
[03:50:27] <Cork> can't really answer, never tried
[03:55:35] <hypfer_office> var w = window.open(); $(w.document.body).html($root.html());  TypeError: Cannot read property 'document' of undefined
[03:55:37] <hypfer_office> any idea why?
[03:56:16] <anli_> Which event is occuring in an input type="text" when the user chooses one of the proposed continuations?
[03:58:00] <maahacka> Hi guys, I am trying to change the default behaviour of a form submit
[03:58:01] <anli_> onchange did not occur
[03:58:31] <maahacka> I have done a $("#form").submit(function(e)) { }
[03:58:42] <maahacka> in this function I do some pre-submt stuff and then I would like to submit the form normally
[03:58:48] <maahacka> how do I do this? just return true?
[03:58:55] <anli_> yes, or just not returning false
[03:59:20] <maahacka> what bothers me is that the stuff I do is asynchroneous
[03:59:37] <maahacka> and I have to fire the submit event from the innermost callback... how do I do this
[03:59:50] <anli_> You can call submit synthetically
[04:00:28] <maahacka> how? document.form.submit() ?
[04:00:37] <anli_> $('form').submit();
[04:00:47] <anli_> but I think you could have use of ajax instead
[04:00:51] <anli_> No form tags
[04:01:17] <anli_> <button onclick="foo()">Click me</button>
[04:01:41] <anli_> Then in function foo(), you use $.post('/the/url.php', data, function(){ /* got response */ });
[04:02:00] <maahacka> If I call the .submit() again it just does a never-ending recursion
[04:02:27] <maahacka> and I don't want to tie the event handler to the submit button, because many people (including me) submit forms with the ENTER key
[04:02:57] <anli_> You can keep track of whather the submit was synthatically made or not
[04:03:21] <anli_> whether
[04:03:27] <anli_> Having a boolean
[04:03:37] <maahacka> how? with a parameter?
[04:03:43] <anli_> Return diffently in the submit handler depending of the value of the boolean
[04:04:10] <anli_> But I still think ajax is what you need to use
[04:04:51] <maahacka> I will eventually use ajax, but this will be after one month. For now I have to submit the form normally
[04:05:12] <maahacka> there is too much code to be refactored if we use AJAX
[04:05:36] <hypfer_office> Cork: problem is that the window that opens automatically gets <html><body> etc. but I need it to stay blank and only append the value of that variable.. so .html isn't right. whats the other alternatve? I think I forgot the name
[04:06:01] <maahacka> anli_, where should I set this boolean?
[04:06:22] <Cork> hypfer_office: you might be able to do something like window.open(dataUri)
[04:06:23] <anli_> Before you call the submit manually
[04:06:34] <Cork> that was what i talked about before
[04:06:40] <Cork> but i don't know if that is allowed
[04:07:03] <maahacka> anli_, do you mean like just a global boolean variable?
[04:07:35] <anli_> Can be
[04:07:58] <anli_> Sounds like you should use one
[04:08:47] <maahacka> hm, or I can just reset the submit() logic in the callback and fire it afterwards :D
[04:08:58] <maahacka> let me try this out :D
[04:17:06] <brollypop> hi im having an issue with jquery .cookie plugin
[04:18:21] <brollypop> it seems like if i save up some data in a $.cookie, and then go to another page ( still the same domain ) i cannot use $.removeCookie
[04:18:27] <brollypop> i mean it returns false
[04:18:52] <brollypop> but if i use it on the same page on which i created the cookie it works as expected
[04:20:26] <maahacka> anli_, the solution was this.submit() from inside of the submit()
[04:21:55] <anli_> Ah, ok
[04:27:19] <Paradisee> why am i not able to drop an item where i drag it? http://jsfiddle.net/Paradisee/hxttz0jx/11/
[04:28:19] <delboy1978uk> hi guys, i have a page that loads other stuff through ajax that has a function loadUsageForSupply(supply_id); However once I .load() the html into the div, when I call the same function in the console it says ReferenceError: loadUsageForSupply is not defined. It used to work when I was doing .post(), but now I am using .ajax() as it is now a multipart file upload form. any help?
[04:29:18] <bloodyscythe> Paradisee, looks like you have the wrong coordinates
[04:30:07] <Paradisee> bloodyscythe: open the console, and give a look
[04:32:19] <aitiba> hi
[04:32:44] <Paradisee> bloodyscythe: also, im using a relative position for the parent div
[04:33:51] <bloodyscythe> sorry I'm learning it myself, but it seems like if you drop an object, the coords of it add up with the values of the div where the map is inside
[04:36:05] <Omar-> aitiba hi
[04:36:14] <Omar-> Paradisee wasn't fixed last time?
[04:36:46] <Paradisee> Omar-: using the parent div with a relative position wont fix it
[04:36:53] <Paradisee> only if i use an absolute position
[04:37:23] <Omar-> Paradisee true
[04:37:40] <bloodyscythe> can you somehow get the position of the map div and subtract it from the dragged image?
[04:37:56] <Paradisee> bloodyscythe: the map isn't the problem
[04:38:11] <bloodyscythe> but?
[04:38:20] <Paradisee> but what
[04:38:29] <bloodyscythe> the problem is...?
[04:38:41] <Paradisee> already told you
[04:38:42] <aitiba> I have this json http://pastebin.com/z5P83xGB. I'm having problem to get the content of multimedia. I try http://pastebin.com/fmS5YTLJ to get the multimedia id but I get "undefined" ¿any ideas please?
[04:40:14] <Paradisee> http://jsfiddle.net/Paradisee/hxttz0jx/14/
[04:40:24] <Paradisee> if you remove the position to the parent it works
[04:40:32] <Paradisee> but i need to put the position as relative
[04:41:39] <bloodyscythe> if you set the map as relative, can you somehow get the coords of the map?
[04:42:02] <Paradisee> do you mean the image or the div
[04:42:07] <bloodyscythe> the div
[04:42:15] <Paradisee> ofc i can
[04:42:28] <Paradisee> just press F12, and it will print out the output
[04:42:34] <Paradisee> with those position
[04:43:53] <delboy1978uk> i have a partial page that i .ajax() into a div from the main page. It cant access a variable on the page that loads it. can anyone help?
[04:44:31] <Paradisee> delboy1978uk: is it accessible?
[04:45:40] <delboy1978uk> it used to work when i was using .post, but now it cant find it now im using .ajax. the error is ReferenceError: loadUsageForSupply is not defined
[04:45:47] <delboy1978uk> so i guess it aint accessible
[04:49:18] <anli_> Seems like if I use a textbox in firefox and chooses some of the proposed continuations, the onselect event will be triggered, however that is not the case in chrome
[04:49:21] <Omar-> aitiba value.multimedia[0].id
[04:49:24] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/g7y30jw6/
[04:49:32] <anli_> So how can I detect "selects" in chrome?
[04:54:11] <Omar-> anli_ change event maybe?
[04:55:57] <anli_> Does not trigger
[04:59:38] <aitiba> Omar-: thanks. so helpfull! :-)
[04:59:55] <Omar-> aitiba de nada :)
[05:00:32] <Omar-> aitiba multimedia: [{}] = array. another option, convert it into an object multimedia: {}
[05:00:40] <Omar-> and use value.multimedia.id instead
[05:01:22] <Omar-> aitiba http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/g7y30jw6/1/
[05:01:50] <aitiba> thanks

[05:12:42] <User458764> Hi, how do I display a flag or language abbrev depending on the url www.mysite.com/en or www.mysite.com/fr...?
[05:13:03] <shoky> anli_: autocomplete. and you can use "input" event in modern browsers
[05:14:44] <anli_> autocomplete is a different component, right?
[05:14:46] <anli_> Must try input
[05:14:50] <anli_> You can answer the so-posting then ;)
[05:15:02] <anli_> Is it oninput?
[05:15:05] <hypfer_office> hm. how do I remove all <option> elements where value is emptystring?
[05:15:48] <hypfer_office> nvm
[05:16:56] <shoky> anli_  the event name is "input"  $('input').on('input', ... )    but actually reading about it now, seems maybe it wont work for the autocompletion in all browsers
[05:19:21] <aitiba> Omar-: and how can I control that value.multimedia[0] i seted please?
[05:20:11] <Omar-> aitiba it depends on how you create JSON array
[05:20:27] <anli_> on input was working for me, it seems
[05:20:32] <anli_> Must try in chrome
[05:20:52] <anli_> Super nice :)
[05:20:54] <delboy1978uk> Guys I am getting a successful response and can see returned json but why isnt this success function running? http://pastie.org/9613685
[05:21:36] <anli_> Hm, internet explorer does not even suggest continuations
[05:21:49] <anli_> Must be some security thing
[05:21:54] <delboy1978uk> tried replacing the entire body, alerting out etc, no console logs showing, yet i do have a response
[05:22:16] <delboy1978uk> why are you using IE? that is a browser selection and download tool ;-)
[05:22:51] <anli_> I must try it in IE as well :)
[05:26:23] <K4T> .bind('click.smoothscroll',  <- what kind of event is this?
[05:32:07] <shoky> delboy1978uk add an error handler
[05:32:28] <shoky> $.post(...).fail(function(xhr,status,error) { ... })
[05:34:01] <shoky> K4T that's a namespaced event. usually used in a plugin so you can easily unbind all handlers e.g. .unbind('.smoothscroll')
[05:34:48] <delboy1978uk> shoky: where should i do that, in the function? the function doesn't appear to run at all
[05:34:59] <delboy1978uk> ah sorry just read your next line
[05:38:45] <delboy1978uk> shoky: you were indeed correct there is a failure, i can log it and figure out whats wrong now cheers
[05:40:26] <JovanJ> delboy1978uk I've changed the line, but now when i var_dump that field, nothing shows up. Seems like it's empty
[05:41:26] <shoky> sweet delboy1978uk
[05:41:33] <JovanJ>  $('form').append('<input type="hidden" name="fieldname[]" value='+this.name+'>');
[05:41:47] <JovanJ> that form is id of my form that I created on page.
[05:41:59] <JovanJ> with method post, but $_POST is empty.
[05:42:15] <FernandoBasso> $( this ).on( 'focus', doSth) never triggers doSth(). What could be the problem?
[05:42:30] <FernandoBasso> That is inside a formElements.each(...
[05:42:33] <krambiorix> hi, how can i, when pressing tab select the first autocomplete option that matches with the current field value?
[05:43:50] <delboy1978uk> check the html, are the hidden fields being added to your form?
[05:44:18] <JovanJ> I am checking it right now... there isn't any...
[05:45:11] <delboy1978uk> ok just create the hidden input on your form normally, and remove the []
[05:46:19] <JovanJ> And, what should i do with js code?
[05:47:05] <FernandoBasso> Ah, I was using this, when it was already pointing to a different context.
[05:48:36] <krambiorix> isn't the tab key event a default functionality in jquery autocomplete 1.9?
[05:52:39] <JovanJ> delboy1978uk what should I change in js file? How to assing that value to hidden field?
[05:53:14] <delboy1978uk> sorry i got connection issues give the field an id and instead of the .each function line, say $('#hidden_id').val($(files).serialize());
[05:54:21] <JovanJ> $(result.files) {$('#hidden_id').val($(files).serialize());}
[05:54:23] <JovanJ> like that?
[05:55:00] <delboy1978uk> $('#hidden_id').val($(result.files).serialize());
[05:58:10] <JovanJ> Somehow it's not working. :/
[05:58:12] <Cork> you can't assign a file to a hidden field
[05:58:24] <Cork> what is it you're trying to do?
[05:58:43] <JovanJ> I am trying to assing image names to hidden fields, so I can do something with them
[05:59:00] <Cork> the content of the file or just the name?
[05:59:07] <JovanJ> just the nae
[05:59:08] <JovanJ> name
[05:59:21] <delboy1978uk> there are multiple files within a result.files object Cork
[05:59:32] <Cork> delboy1978uk: sure, and?
[06:00:10] <delboy1978uk> i was helping him serialize the object, and set the .val() of his hidden field, which he can eventually json_decode in PHP
[06:00:37] <Cork> you can't serialize a files object
[06:00:46] <Cork> serialize is for form fields
[06:00:53] <Cork> not files collections
[06:01:05] <delboy1978uk> ah right well that'll be why then
[06:01:26] <delboy1978uk> ok JovanJ go back to using the .each function
[06:01:46] <delboy1978uk> and get it alerting the names out again
[06:02:06] <Cork> so something like $.map(reasult, function(file) { return file.name; }).join(', ') might work
[06:02:24] <Cork> but not sure if .map can loop those collections
[06:02:28] <Cork> i think it can
[06:02:42] <JovanJ> One second to change the code
[06:03:45] <JovanJ> Done.
[06:03:52] <JovanJ> It works, and it displays all the names of images.
[06:05:09] <delboy1978uk> what are we back to alerting them at the minute?
[06:05:12] <Cork> JovanJ: you need to use formData if you want to upload files over ajax
[06:05:35] <JovanJ> deloby1978uk yes. Alerts works just fine alert(file.name)
[06:05:36] <Cork> not sure what you're trying to do but anyway
[06:06:04] <JovanJ> Cork, I've blueimp image uploader, and what I am trying to do is, to get all image names and to work with databases.
[06:06:25] <Cork> JovanJ: "work with databases"?
[06:06:33] <Cork> you're not interested in the file data?
[06:06:48] <JovanJ> sorry, assing them to $_POST, so I can put names in database.
[06:07:09] <Cork> uh
[06:07:15] <Cork> i really don't get what your doing
[06:07:33] <Cork> if you're uploading the files, just get the filename from the multipart form
[06:07:41] <JovanJ> I am uploading images with jquery blueimp plugin, and that upload works.
[06:07:53] <Cork> then why do you need the names client side?
[06:07:56] <JovanJ> It's not possible like that, because it's used to be run from js, and it's empty.
[06:08:11] <Cork> what is empty?
[06:08:21] <JovanJ> $_POST
[06:08:38] <Cork> post doesn't hold file uploads
[06:08:50] <Cork> $_FILE does
[06:08:58] <JovanJ> My bad, that's empty too.
[06:09:08] <JovanJ> Not sure how, and how plugin holds it, but it's empty.
[06:09:17] <JovanJ> And pictures are uploaded.
[06:09:18] <Cork> then you have much bigger problems then just the filenames
[06:09:45] <JovanJ> The point is, pictures are uploaded with no errors or anything, I just need to get filenames somehow.
[06:10:14] <Cork> might be better to check why the upload plugin is broken?
[06:10:30] <JovanJ> It's not broken, it's just the way how it works.
[06:10:43] <Cork> if it uploads the data without the filename, then ya it is broken
[06:11:06] <Cork> my point is your working around the bug instead of fixing the bug
[06:11:19] <JovanJ> He uploads them with name, size, type. But I need that name.
[06:11:31] <Cork> ok?
[06:11:36] <JovanJ> delboy1978uk do you've some idea what is the next step instead of alerting them?
[06:11:46] <Cork> if the plugin does its job you would have the name server side
[06:11:51] <Cork> no need to hack at it client side
[06:12:28] <JovanJ> Something is just wrong, I don't get it what.
[06:12:40] <Cork> then it might be worth looking into?
[06:12:42] <JovanJ> Do you've some idea how I am supposed to write something to hidden field?
[06:12:53] <Cork> then it might be worth looking into?
[06:12:56] <Cork> opps
[06:12:57] <JovanJ> i've file.name and when I alert it, I got all the name.
[06:12:59] <Cork> *as it might be something seriously wrong
[06:13:13] <Cork> your uploaded data might be corr
[06:13:25] <Cork> man i can't type right now...
[06:13:31] <mpajor> Stop doing drugs.
[06:13:33] <JovanJ> ok.
[06:13:36] <Cork> lol
[06:13:41] <delboy1978uk> yeah you could make a javascript var my_var = ''; outside of the .each(), and in sidethe each bit instead of alerting sar my_var += this.name +',';
[06:13:49] <Cork> well i've been coding for 8h straight
[06:13:54] <Cork> starts to be a bit mussy
[06:14:04] <delboy1978uk> than after the each function $('#hidden_field_id').val(my_var);
[06:14:08] <Cork> O_o
[06:14:20] <Cork> the $.map i gave you before should give you a ready to use string
[06:14:22] <delboy1978uk> ok i'm off for lunch good luck amigo
[06:14:30] <JovanJ> thanks bro
[06:14:50] <Cork> $('#hidden_field_id').val($.map(reasult, function(file) { return file.name; }).join(', '))
[06:14:59] <Cork> but, what ever
[06:15:05] <Cork> hack at it
[06:15:14] <JovanJ> I'll try that.
[06:15:19] <JovanJ> That latest part, join
[06:15:24] <JovanJ> what i used for and what should i put there?
[06:15:31] * Cork has a serious problem with ignoring problems
[06:17:23] <JovanJ> Cork , what I am supposed to put in that join ?
[06:17:48] <Cork> JovanJ: where you was about to do the .each add into a variable concat and then add it in the same field
[06:18:10] <Cork> it does the same thing, just less messy
[06:18:36] <JovanJ> Are you able to write that, I am a bit lost and not quite sure what I am supposed to do...
[06:19:02] <Cork> JovanJ: you want to set a list of filenames to a field called hidden_field_id?
[06:19:08] <Cork> that command does that
[06:19:11] <JovanJ> exactly
[06:19:14] <Cork> call it when you want to populate the field
[06:21:05] <JovanJ> I don't get it..
[06:21:27] <Cork> uh
[06:21:33] <Cork> what don't you get?
[06:21:44] <JovanJ> what to write, and where...
[06:22:09] <Cork> you have some form of form submission
[06:22:33] <Cork> and on submitting that form you run that command to populate the hidden field
[06:22:47] <Cork> that should be all there is to it
[06:24:19] <JovanJ> $('#hidden_field_id').val($.map(reasult, function(file) { return file.name; }).join(', '))
[06:24:21] * kevin waves
[06:24:23] <JovanJ> I get it know.
[06:24:30] <JovanJ> But that latest thing .join()
[06:24:35] <JovanJ> is making me confused.
[06:24:48] <Cork> JovanJ: $.map returns an array
[06:24:54] <Cork> you need to join it to a string
[06:25:04] <Cork> join(', ')
[06:25:19] <Cork> make a string like 'file1, file2, file3'
[06:25:28] <Cork> if you want to use another separator go at it
[06:26:46] <litropy> I'm having trouble understanding how to do stepwise animations. Right now, I'm chaining them together using the complete function, but it seems like there might be a better way, using queue? http://jsfiddle.net/etnqtq9u/15/
[06:27:38] <Cork> litropy: not really
[06:27:50] <Cork> if you use queues you would still have to fire the queue
[06:28:57] <JovanJ> Cork: it's not working, now upload window wont show up.
[06:29:21] <Cork> JovanJ: look in your browsers console
[06:30:28] <JovanJ> SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list  ('#fieldname').val($.map(result.function(file) {
[06:30:37] <Alski> Wondering, I am trying to make a form work with jquery. In the action of the form, I have javascript:void(0); on my form (with ID of addTag) to avoid leaving the page, and in the jquery, I have this selected: $('#addTag').submit(function() { alert('test') }
[06:31:29] <litropy> Cork, it would be more convenient because I already have a bunch of things in complete. I'm $(".myclass").each( [buncha settings and calculations] $this.animate(css stuff), 400, function() {buncha things for after, then I'd like to if ($this.attr("id") === 'myid1') {queue it for first} else if $this.attr("id") === 'myid2'){queue it second, to fire after first}
[06:31:45] <Cork> litropy: this is what you can do http://jsfiddle.net/etnqtq9u/16/
[06:31:50] <Cork> not sure it is much better though
[06:32:09] <Cork> i would argue it isn't
[06:33:39] <Cork> Alski: remove the javascript part
[06:33:48] <Cork> Alski: and just call event.preventDefault() in js
[06:34:52] <Alski> What should be in the action?
[06:35:24] <Cork> if you don't have anything to enter in it
[06:35:25] <Cork> remove it
[06:37:12] <Alski> Cork: I'm getting "method not allowed" when action is removed. My JQuery selector is at least fine right?
[06:38:52] <Cork> Alski: http://jsfiddle.net/jafqq984/
[06:44:00] <Alski> Cork: hmm.. working on jsfiddle, but in my app, it's now refreshing the page...
[06:44:13] <Alski> I wonder if it's possibly Laravel's fault, somewhere in there?
[06:44:23] <Cork> Alski: uh, if you stop the form from submitting it won't update the form
[06:44:27] <Cork> s/form/page/
[06:44:52] <Cork> unless you have some code somewhere that does something on submit
[06:47:24] <ratbuddy__> http://pastebin.com/aM7Jk7gs is my silly code - it works fine to add a new line at the end, is there a simple change I can make to have it remove a line from the end of the table instead, so users can both add and remove?
[06:47:45] <ratbuddy__> like instead of .insertAfter, .removeFromEnd or something?
[06:47:58] <Alski> cork: here is an updated fiddle, still returning an error
[06:48:01] <Alski> http://jsfiddle.net/jafqq984/1/
[06:48:34] <Cork> Alski: the event handler won't find the form as you add it on click
[06:48:43] <Cork> Alski: you would have to use delegated event listeners
[06:48:59] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com delegate
[06:49:00] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation â†’ http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:49:04] <Alski> If you click first? I don't see why, it's added to the dom right?
[06:49:20] <Cork> it adds the form ya
[06:49:26] <Cork> but you don't have any event handlers for it
[06:50:02] <decx> my favorite url http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[06:50:08] <Cork> ratbuddy__: not sure what it is you're trying to do
[06:51:09] <Alski> Ah interestesting... thank you cork and decx
[06:51:16] <ratbuddy__> Cork, my script adds a new line to the end of the form input table when you click on the 'steeladd' element.. I'd like to add a second element (steelremove) that removes the last line from that table
[06:51:44] <ratbuddy__> it's for a variable-number-of-lines form input, so the user can add or remove lines to get the right number of entries
[06:51:45] <Cork> ratbuddy__: add it to the line you added you mean?
[06:52:15] <ratbuddy__> nope, just something that works exactly like insertAfter, only it removes the last element in the table instead of adding a new element to the table
[06:52:16] <Cork> ratbuddy__: just add a <button class="remove">Remove</button>
[06:52:44] <Cork> ratbuddy__: ('#steeltable tbody>tr:last').remove()
[06:53:02] <Cork> btw no need for the tbody > tr
[06:53:10] <Cork> just do tbody tr
[06:53:47] <ratbuddy__> beautiful, perfect, thanks
[07:05:50] <krambiorix> how can i show my autocomplete on focussing the field?
[07:09:48] <becom33> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bb946cf74e07cfdb00ba Im having some trouble with preg_match I think
[07:21:52] <pyCasso> greetings, I have a small issue removing a class from elements when on home page of site
[07:21:59] <pyCasso> not sure what im missing
[07:22:09] <pyCasso> currently all other pages work nicely, but the home page doesn't
[07:22:18] <pyCasso> here is my code example https://bpaste.net/show/ac29457c84e0
[07:23:40] <delboy1978uk> why oh why is this not working properly anymore? $('#consumptionModal').modal('hide');   modal disappears but the faded backround remains!
[07:23:47] <delboy1978uk> its a bootstrap modal btw
[07:24:03] <BillCris_> pyCasso: That's regex seems redundant?
[07:24:19] <BillCris_> Oh you're removing slashes, nevermind.
[07:24:28] <BillCris_> Wait it's still redundant.
[07:25:57] <pyCasso> BillCris: im removing begining and ending slashes
[07:27:38] <BillCris_> pyCasso: The or was throwing me off.
[07:29:17] <pyCasso> Im thinking perhaps creating this a function and conditionally applying it to all pages not home page based on location.pathname. ??
[07:30:38] <grebett> part
[07:30:44] <grebett> noob spotted :)
[07:31:24] <BillCris_> pyCasso: http://jsbin.com/hocelunipowe/1/edit?html,css,js,output how about this?
[07:34:42] <BillCris_> pyCasso: http://jsbin.com/hocelunipowe/2/edit?html,js,output might be a little quicker..
[07:35:21] <pyCasso> BillCris_: yeah, i saw how you were updating it live..didn't know jsbin had this
[07:36:07] <decx> yuk
[07:36:21] <BillCris_> pyCasso: I never know what's going on with half the links I send.
[07:36:41] <decx> active menu item should be done when building the page imho
[07:36:51] <BillCris_> decx: Agreed.
[08:10:40] <Forbidd3n> How would I se the first option to be selected if I have this - item.find('select').val( ... )
[08:11:16] <Forbidd3n> I know I can do $('select').val( $('select option:first-child').val() );
[08:11:53] <Forbidd3n> but I can't do that in this case
[08:12:12] <Forbidd3n> I tried $(this+' option:first-child').val() but didn't work
[08:13:43] <Forbidd3n> nvm
[08:13:50] <Forbidd3n> I figured it out
[08:14:10] <nonconvergent> I've got an issue. I have a button that reloads a page via "window.location = '${flowExecutionUrl}&_eventId='+wf_transition;" I think some of that is spring stuff. I also have message I've put on that page in a hidden div that I'd like shown when that button is clicked, but since its hidden on load, it immediately hides again.
[08:19:07] <GreekFreak> hi all
[08:19:43] <Hooloovoo> nonconvergent: Well... if the page reloads it would be kinda hard to show it...
[08:20:17] <Hooloovoo> GreekFreak: Hi GreekFreak!
[08:20:19] <GreekFreak> I am using the jQuery Tabs. I would like to make them scrollable. I have found 2 good plugins (by 'aamirafrid' and 'jizmoz') but neither seem to work with the new jQuery-UI. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
[08:21:54] <nonconvergent> Hooloovoo: Hence my issue.
[08:22:21] <Aamir> GreekFreak: read the comments here http://aamirafridi.com/jquery/jquery-scrollable-tabs
[08:22:36] <Aamir> GreekFreak: this one http://aamirafridi.com/jquery/jquery-scrollable-tabs#comment-1582151662
[08:28:50] <GreekFreak> Hi Aamir . I assume this is your work. Looks really good from the Demo. I downloaded version 2
[08:28:55] <Hooloovoo> nonconvergent: That doesn't sound like a jQuery issue. You have to rethink how that renders.
[08:29:08] <Hooloovoo> nonconvergent: Maybe render the box as visible in backend?
[08:29:40] <Aamir> GreekFreak: yes but I haven't touched it since years now :P
[08:31:48] <GreekFreak> Aamir, ah. I find it odd it's not standard functionality :/ Trying to get the version 2 to work. What do you mean I have to reference "jquery-migrate-1.2.1" ? is that for tabs().scrollabletab() or for xtabs() ?
[08:33:13] <Aamir> GreekFreak: thats not my comment so not sure what that guy means. Just noticed that the link he provided is not working as well. You might reply that comment and ask for correct URL for his fix.
[08:34:22] <GreekFreak> Aamir, oh I just assumed that the link was to the JS file and that I had to copy/paste the code in there
[08:34:53] <Aamir> GreekFreak: if you can open the link, then yes. Just have a look at the code he wrote.
[08:35:18] <Lehl0r> can someone tell me how to compare a val to a text ?
[08:35:42] <Lehl0r> so for instance i have $(this).val()==="+"
[08:35:53] <Lehl0r> but it seems to be always true
[08:35:59] <Lehl0r> is there something i miss ?
[08:36:32] <jorvis> How can you find out what something is when jQuery just prints it as an [object Object]?  I'm trying to iterate over 5 svgs in my document like this:  http://pastie.org/9614116
[08:37:17] <GreekFreak> Aamir, your version 2 and his version say that '.scrollabletab()' is not a function. Your version 1 says that $.browser doesn't exist. I have no experience with plugins, so sorry for pestering you like this.
[08:37:22] <NoiseEee> jorvis: console log it on its own, without a string beforehand
[08:38:11] <jorvis> NoiseEee:  Ah, that's quite different
[08:38:40] <Aamir> GreekFreak: check the jquery UI version on my demo page for Version 1 and use the same jQuery and jQuery UI versions. If you are using newer versions of jQuery and jQuery UI than my plugin's version 1 will not work for you.
[08:39:40] <jorvis> NoiseEee:  it says:  [prevObject: n.fn.init[1], context: document, selector: "svg", jquery: "1.11.0", constructor: function…]    How do I just get the class value of the <svg> object?
[08:42:35] <NoiseEee> jorvis: console.log(mySVG.prop('class')) should work
[08:44:18] <jorvis> NoiseEee:  http://pastie.org/9614132
[08:46:18] <NoiseEee> jorvis: i don't get what  svg =  $("svg", svg_doc); is doing
[08:47:17] <NoiseEee> jorvis: i bet you're not even selecting the SVG (I presume its in an iframe?).   try $(svg_doc).find('svg')
[08:47:33] <jorvis> NoiseEee:  It was trying to get at the svg element within the <object>
[08:47:52] <jorvis> NoiseEee:  The page looks like this:  http://gear.igs.umaryland.edu/
[08:48:01] <jorvis> Though that's not where my live edits are going
[08:50:28] <NoiseEee> jorvis: try this in console there var obj = $('object[data="img/Vestibule_false_color.svg"]')[0].contentDocument; $(obj).find('svg');
[08:50:36] <NoiseEee> jorvis: but there's no class on the SVG; there's a class on the object though
[08:50:56] <jorvis> NoiseEee:  Wait, this works on the server, but not when I'm doing it locally via localhost.   Is there some cross-host security issue here?
[08:51:51] <jorvis> (my main guide has been here: http://benfrain.com/selecting-svg-inside-tags-with-javascript/)
[08:52:46] <NoiseEee> jorvis: might be a case of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy but im not sure what you mean by 'not when doing it locally via localhost'
[08:52:50] <NoiseEee> but i gotta split good luck
[08:52:58] <jorvis> OK, thanks
[08:57:23] <jorvis> NoiseEee:  In case you're still here, I found it.  Totally confused though.  The code to iterate the <object> elements and get the classes from within the SVGs works, but only if they're not set as display:none; via CSS.  I didn't know the CSS visibility properties could affect whether Jquery could access the elements.
[08:59:16] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't.
[08:59:43] <robertmaxrees> iirc svg and jquery don't necessarily play nice together natively.
[09:01:13] <NoiseEee> also doing <svg> with an <object> can get a bit funky
[09:01:38] <NoiseEee> but you should put up some fiddles for people to view and test if you have the time jorvis
[09:02:06] <jorvis> I will
[09:02:20] <GeorgesLeYeti> HI
[09:02:53] <NoiseEee> im a month away from doing some fancy SVG stuff in my project jorvis so I'd appreciate you going through the jungle ahead of me :)
[09:02:56] <GeorgesLeYeti> How could i get the status with a get request like: $.get url ...
[09:04:28] <robertmaxrees> GeorgesLeYeti set a status bit using one of the callbacks and check that pit.
[09:04:29] <robertmaxrees> *bit
[09:04:33] <jorvis> NoiseEee:  Won't putting it on JS fiddle cause the Same origin issue?
[09:04:48] <NoiseEee> yeah it might jorvis :|
[09:05:02] <robertmaxrees> GeorgesLeYeti or use deferreds and go from there.
[09:06:18] <GeorgesLeYeti> robertmaxrees: ok ty
[09:06:38] <litropy> I'm having issues with setting CSS and THEN animating. It seems $.animate fires while CSS is being set. Do I really have to use $.when($(this).css()).done($.animate)?
[09:07:18] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to, litropy.  css should be basically instant.
[09:07:25] <robertmaxrees> animate calls you usually need to wait for.
[09:10:49] <litropy> robertmaxrees, even when set from jQ?
[09:10:54] <litropy> CSS is*
[09:11:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:11:25] <litropy> Hmmm.
[09:12:14] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ marvimias
[09:12:14] <b-ot> marvimias: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:12:35] <robertmaxrees> marvimias break your question apart into the jquery part and php part.  i don't know PHP, btw.
[09:12:46] <robertmaxrees> but PMing people is generally kind of a no-no ;)
[09:36:30] <Omar-> hi
[09:36:39] <Omar-> !ask @ Omar-
[09:36:39] <b-ot> Omar-: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:37:05] * litropy facepalms
[09:37:10] <litropy> thx robertmaxrees
[09:38:24] <Omar-> !help
[09:38:25] <b-ot> Omar-: NO U! ( http://aether.gf3.ca/factoids )
[09:38:31] <Omar-> haha
[09:40:43] <robertmaxrees> litropy fsho
[09:41:24] <robertmaxrees> !PHP
[09:41:24] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: You're asking a JavaScript question but you're showing us PHP instead of HTML and JavaScript. Maybe your PHP code results in well-formed JavaScript code, maybe it doesn't; we don't know. Please show us the HTML JavaScript that the browser sees.
[09:41:30] <robertmaxrees> perfect.
[09:42:35] <robertmaxrees> !anyone
[09:42:36] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
[09:42:56] <BillCris_> lol
[09:42:58] <BillCris_> what?
[09:43:03] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha that's an old one.
[09:45:19] <mdev> $(document.body).on('click', '.test', function(event) only way I can get on event to handle dynamic clicks
[09:45:23] <mdev> is this cleanest way to do it?
[09:46:28] <BillCris_> mdev: You should get closer than document.body, but yeah, that's the right approach.
[09:46:39] <mdev> closer in what way
[09:46:58] <BillCris_> Like, closest static parent.
[09:47:18] <mdev> herm ok thanks
[09:47:28] <mdev> also i'd like to say 1.9 removing completely jQuery.browser.msie is insanely dumb
[09:47:35] <BillCris_> $('.items').on('click', '.item', foo); vs $(document.body).on('click', '.item', foo);
[09:47:46] <mdev> I wish they'd actually ask the community what they want instead of just stripping out features people rely on in the past
[09:47:51] <BillCris_> mdev: Some would argue browser detection is insanely dumb.
[09:47:54] <Omar-> mdev cleanest way, is $(parent_static).on("event", "dynamic_elm_
[09:48:01] <Omar-> cleaner*
[09:48:10] <mdev> that's smart thanks Omar
[09:48:19] <Omar-> as BillCris_ said
[09:48:24] <mdev> thanks both then
[09:48:44] <Omar-> you're welcome
[09:48:46] <BillCriswell> No problemo.
[09:49:26] <Omar-> robertmaxrees
[09:49:40] <Omar-> !hi robertmaxrees
[09:49:46] <Omar-> !bot
[09:49:52] <Omar-> !b-ot
[09:49:53] <b-ot> Omar-: so smart
[09:50:08] <Omar-> b-ot i know, show me list of commends
[09:50:18] <Omar-> !list

[09:55:50] <robertmaxrees> feature detection ftw
[09:56:01] <briefchain>  i use hide('slide', {direction: 'up'}, 500); but parent elements are not resized accordingly. how do i achieve this?
[09:56:08] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Is this for the bot?
[09:56:16] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell yep.
[09:57:04] <BillCriswell> http://i.imgur.com/oJo5gJQ.gif this is how I dance.
[09:57:52] <Omar-> thanks robertmaxrees
[09:57:57] <Omar-> !10x
[09:57:57] <b-ot> Omar-: 10 page resume
[09:58:26] <robertmaxrees> the amount of mistakes in here is pretty funny.
[09:58:29] <Omar-> robertmaxrees are you feeling bored?
[09:58:45] <robertmaxrees> not atm.  whyfor?
[09:58:52] <Omar-> briefchain can you provide a fiddle?
[09:59:16] <Omar-> robertmaxrees i'd like you to review something
[09:59:29] <Omar-> later not too urgent
[09:59:31] <robertmaxrees> i can take a poke if you need.
[09:59:45] <robertmaxrees> dumping around in coldfusion land right now so i'm going batty.
[10:00:04] <Omar-> robertmaxrees i'll need to explain the whole thing
[10:00:09] <Omar-> so it'll take a while
[10:01:02] <robertmaxrees> whenever works for you i guess.
[10:02:56] <briefchain> Omar-: im trying
[10:08:47] <Omar-> !ping Omar-
[10:10:38] <briefchain> i dont achieve to prevent a forms standard action on jsfiddle
[10:14:09] <Omar-> briefchain what do you mean?
[10:14:34] <Zzaichik> Hey - I want to get the height of 2 children elements and add them together. How can I do this?  Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/bbz0avnn/
[10:14:38] <BillCriswell> briefchain: I'd just use jsfiddle.net. I was experiencing something similar with links the other day.
[10:15:34] <briefchain> http://jsfiddle.net/9nbbz6vj/ If you press the Button, an error occurs
[10:15:49] <Omar-> Zzaichik http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/bbz0avnn/1/
[10:15:57] <briefchain> mhh, after saving, it is another erro :)
[10:16:10] <Zzaichik> Omar-:  and what if they're different heights?
[10:16:54] <robertmaxrees> Omar- feel free to PM if you want.
[10:18:01] <Omar-> Zzaichik .children().outerHeight()
[10:18:12] <Omar-> briefchain http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/9nbbz6vj/1/ e.preventDefault()
[10:21:08] <Zzaichik> Hey - I want to get the height of 2 children elements and add them together. How can I do this? Â Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/bbz0avnn/3/  Omar- .children() and .find() return the same thing in this case, because it isn't adding them together.
[10:21:51] <Omar-> Zzaichik as you can see, second child has no height
[10:21:56] <Omar-> it returns zero
[10:22:39] <briefchain> Omar-: thx
[10:23:30] <briefchain> http://jsfiddle.net/9nbbz6vj/3/ how is it possible to resize #Action on pressing the button
[10:23:42] <Zzaichik> Omar-:  well that just isn't true ..at all..
[10:24:05] <Omar-> Zzaichik i'll double check
[10:25:06] <Zzaichik> http://jsfiddle.net/bbz0avnn/4/
[10:26:36] <Zzaichik> I feel like I could use .each() here but I'm not sure how to hook it up.
[10:27:08] <Omar-> Zzaichik console.log(total_height); returns 38
[10:27:23] <Zzaichik> right - and I need it to equal the height of both children
[10:27:48] <Zzaichik> total_height is only getting the height of the first child.
[10:28:42] <Zzaichik> Omar-:  that var, total_height, is what needs to be adjusted.
[10:29:25] <Omar-> Zzaichik yup, parent has zero height
[10:29:36] <Omar-> yet it's not an issue
[10:29:49] <Zzaichik> Omar-:  yep, parent is zero because I'm setting it to 0.
[10:30:14] <Zzaichik> That's why I need the height of both children elements and then add them together.
[10:30:30] <Zzaichik> So that I can animate the dropdown with CSS transitions
[10:32:52] <briefchain> http://jsfiddle.net/9nbbz6vj/3/ how is it possible to resize #Action on pressing the button
[10:35:25] <briefchain> apparently, the inner divs hieght does not change on sliding
[10:35:45] <robertmaxrees> briefchain bind to the click event of the button and resize that contianer?
[10:36:07] <robertmaxrees> or hook into the submit logic you've already got there.
[10:36:54] <briefchain> robertmaxrees: but the jquery function slide changes my content, but the size of #links is not changed
[10:37:07] <briefchain> so i think if have to use another function or some params
[10:37:37] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:37:47] <robertmaxrees> what, exactly, do you want to happen when you click that button?
[10:40:12] <briefchain> i want the numbers to appear in a downmove (like now), but the size of #Action should be minimal to fit the content
[10:40:21] <briefchain> at every time
[10:40:30] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want that height to animate as well?
[10:40:58] <briefchain> yes
[10:41:42] <robertmaxrees> do your animation on #action instead
[10:44:25] <Zzaichik> Anyone else have any ideas?  http://jsfiddle.net/bbz0avnn/7/
[10:46:56] <BillCriswell> Zzaichik: http://jsfiddle.net/bbz0avnn/8/ you can do this, but another trick is to animate min-height instead of height.
[10:47:09] <BillCriswell> I think... I'd have to mess around with that.
[10:47:20] <BillCriswell> Might just want to use this actually cause I'm not going to mess around with it.
[10:47:28] <Zzaichik> oh interesting. haha okay
[10:48:03] <Zzaichik> Yes! No that's what I was looking for. I couldn't get it to work using .each()
[10:48:31] <Zzaichik> I was having problems getting it to work. One of those things where I know what needs to happen but just couldn't get it to work.
[10:49:04] <mdev> how can I access the contents of a class within a class
[10:49:05] <BillCriswell> Zzaichik: Understood.
[10:49:10] <mdev> in, go through the next found
[10:49:13] <Zzaichik> BillCriswell:  thank you sir
[10:49:18] <BillCriswell> Zzaichik: No trouble at all.
[10:49:29] <mdev> like $(".test").edit a specific div class with various have same name
[10:49:30] <BillCriswell> mdev: each?
[10:49:35] <mdev> anyway to avoid each
[10:49:39] <mdev> if I know the index
[10:49:41] <BillCriswell> mdev: You can get them by index.
[10:49:44] <mdev> how?
[10:49:50] <BillCriswell> $('.test').eq(2).foo()
[10:49:59] <mdev> awesome thanks
[10:50:19] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[10:52:08] <pyCasso> BillCris_: thanks Bill! for the help
[10:52:26] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[10:53:30] <doug_> anli_: Zzaichik http://jsfiddle.net/bbz0avnn/9/
[10:54:31] <doug_> sorry anli_ didnt mean to message you
[10:58:12] <Zzaichik> doug_:  nice. Yeah I was screwing up the .each() func thank you
[10:59:56] <decx> what is the jquery version of createDocumentFragment() ?
[11:00:09] <decx> $('') ?`
[11:00:13] <Respek> !api .find
[11:00:13] <b-ot> Respek: No matches.
[11:00:19] <Respek> !api .addClass
[11:00:19] <b-ot> Respek: No matches.
[11:00:31] <BillCriswell> decx: Sounds about right?
[11:00:36] <Respek> Am I doing it wrong?
[11:00:37] <robertmaxrees> decx yep.
[11:00:43] <Respek> !api addclass
[11:00:43] <b-ot> Respek: .addClass(): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[11:00:49] <robertmaxrees> $('<div>');
[11:00:57] <robertmaxrees> that uses document fragments under the hood iirc.
[11:01:00] <BillCriswell> I think it needs to have the / to work in old IE.
[11:01:11] <BillCriswell> If you care about that monster.
[11:01:15] <robertmaxrees> i do :(
[11:01:26] <decx> i cant append to $('')
[11:01:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:01:41] <robertmaxrees> oh, you need to give it an element.
[11:01:45] <doug_> decx: .add
[11:01:56] <doug_> wait no nevermind
[11:01:56] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't append to the fragment, doug_
[11:01:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:02:33] <robertmaxrees> yeahm, don't look like you can create an empty fragment.
[11:02:48] <BillCriswell> decx: You can just give it a div then unwrap it.
[11:03:08] <robertmaxrees> or just create an empty collection and add stuff to it instead.
[11:03:11] <decx> i know add it's slow, and unwrapping is what i do now
[11:03:57] <decx> it's strange because createDocumentFragment creates a nice empty space to appendChild to
[11:04:12] <robertmaxrees> and is performant as all hell becuase it's unrendered dom goodness.
[11:04:40] <BillCriswell> Do you even website bro
[11:05:07] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/letsgetrandy/brototype
[11:05:12] <robertmaxrees> legit considering actually using this.
[11:06:11] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Awesome.
[11:06:30] <robertmaxrees> right?  hilarious AND useful.
[11:06:52] <BillCriswell> .giveMeProps()
[11:06:55] <BillCriswell> holy shit.
[11:07:01] <robertmaxrees> right?
[11:07:32] <robertmaxrees> .iDontAlways().butWhenIDo()
[11:07:36] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/8cpwvj3y/
[11:08:15] <robertmaxrees> decx right, because how does it now what the original object is?
[11:08:34] <BillCriswell> How did the term "frag" become known as a kill?
[11:08:36] <robertmaxrees> var frag = $('') is a problem because it doesn't know what you're tyring to get out of it.  nothingto parse.
[11:09:03] <decx> well you answered with confidence that this would be the equivalent of createfragment :D
[11:09:19] <robertmaxrees> decx thought you meant tossing in markup in there >.>
[11:09:21] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[11:09:32] <decx> right
[11:09:42] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell remember when, in old UT and Quake games, enemies would explode?  they're "Fragment"?
[11:09:52] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I do not.
[11:10:00] <doug_> gibs?
[11:10:24] <robertmaxrees> iirc that's where it came from.  frag - fragment - explode, etc.
[11:10:28] <robertmaxrees> but i couldbe wrong.
[11:10:55] <decx> deathmatch game is to kill (or "frag", from the military term)
[11:11:14] <decx> In the United States military, fragging (from fragmentation grenade) refers to the act of murdering members of the military, particularly commanders of a fighting unit.
[11:11:44] <BillCriswell> Too many words out there guys.
[11:11:55] <BillCriswell> We need to remove at least half of them from the dictionary.
[11:11:57] <decx> code.jquery.com slow?
[11:12:06] <decx> is*
[11:12:28] <BillCriswell> decx: Feels fine to me.
[11:12:38] <robertmaxrees> zippy on my end.
[11:12:45] <decx> anyway http://jsfiddle.net/decx/hspz6rmb/6/
[11:13:12] <decx> the collection is for data() to not have a traversal on mouseleave
[11:15:40] <doug_> BillCriswell: you think that's bad? I recently heard that chinese, for a single meaning, has different words for when you speak to someone older than you, someone younger than you, someone that is your superior, someone that is your subordinate, etc
[11:15:57] <robertmaxrees> sort of
[11:16:00] <BillCriswell> doug_: That sounds rough.
[11:16:04] <robertmaxrees> varying levels of formality
[11:16:13] <doug_> ah
[11:16:14] <robertmaxrees> and it can really change the meaning of what you're saying.
[11:16:22] <robertmaxrees> pitch, however, it important.
[11:16:37] <robertmaxrees> the variations in relative pitch can substantially change the meaning of a word.
[11:16:47] <robertmaxrees> like, not just intent, but what you're actually saying.
[11:19:51] <BillCriswell> decx: If you up the number of blinds a lot it feels like you're downloading the image on 56k
[11:20:24] <BillCriswell> Hmm.. gave me an idea.
[11:20:34] <decx> if you create a grid instead of bars that could be neat
[11:21:12] <BillCriswell> I was thinking an absolutely positioned bar at the bottom that animated from left to right each height increase haha
[11:21:24] <MikeSee> How would one select the <tr></tr> that an anchor tag that was clicked resides in?  <tr class="non-unique"><td><a onclick="function();">text</a></td></tr>, here is my fiddle, I'm super confused. http://jsfiddle.net/09k1b6gf/6/
[11:21:35] <robertmaxrees> .closest()
[11:21:38] <BillCriswell> MikeSee: .closest('tr')
[11:21:55] <robertmaxrees> and get that binding out of your html.
[11:22:28] <MikeSee> robertmaxrees: I'm working on that part, I want to do the $(".class").click() method
[11:22:51] <MikeSee> closest(), well tht makes perfect sense..
[11:22:58] <robertmaxrees> it'll be easier if you start doing it that wayu.
[11:23:06] <robertmaxrees> instead of going through and cleaning up all your html.
[11:23:21] <MikeSee> robertmaxrees: I'm still new to JS, so I appreciate tips like that.
[11:23:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/09k1b6gf/7/
[11:23:29] <robertmaxrees> super easy stuff.
[11:25:17] <MikeSee> That fiddle doesn't work for me, robertmaxrees.  Did I miss something?
[11:26:16] <robertmaxrees> the binding works.  what's this code trying to do?
[11:26:59] <MikeSee> make each row into editable fields to submit for changes.
[11:27:17] <robertmaxrees> what's with that index check?
[11:27:33] <MikeSee> I don't need the first and last <td>'s converted, only the center 4
[11:27:48] <robertmaxrees> also: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/09k1b6gf/7/
[11:27:55] <robertmaxrees> onDomReady
[11:28:05] <BillCriswell> My focus today is shot.
[11:28:39] <robertmaxrees> MikeSee i'd change that to use data attributes or classes instead.  selecting elements based on index always winds up getting awkward.
[11:29:19] <doug_> so codemirror will never be fixed on firefix I guess
[11:29:22] <robertmaxrees> partially because you wind up in cases where you update the html and not the JS and stuff brakes.
[11:29:25] <robertmaxrees> *breas
[11:29:44] <robertmaxrees> fff you get the gist.  i cannot type today apparently.
[11:30:28] <robertmaxrees> oh and MikeSee don't return false out of event handlers like that. http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/09k1b6gf/8/ pass the event object and preventDefault() on it.
[11:30:31] <doug_> robertmaxrees: .html('<textarea>' + str + '</textarea>')    <-- security hole
[11:30:38] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:30:45] <robertmaxrees> but i'ma let this dude figure that part out ;)
[11:30:46] <decx> $(this).closest(".editable").find("td").slice(1,-1).each(function ... ^^
[11:30:47] <robertmaxrees> not my code.
[11:31:07] <doug_> I know
[11:31:09] <robertmaxrees> also: your backend should aggressively filter any potentially dangerous shit, too.
[11:31:13] <MikeSee> doug_: I just need to sort the functionality out atm.
[11:32:45] <decx> btw if you just use .html() you dont need each, it has its own
[11:35:52] <MikeSee> robertmaxrees: Yeah, the framework takes care of XSS and SQL injection.  decx: I'm not sure how I would re-write my code with that new knowldge.
[11:36:09] <bdmc> probably a silly question, but is there anybody around who could talk to me about a datatables error?   I am getting "TypeError: nThs[(i - iCorrector)] is undefined
[11:36:10] <robertmaxrees> MikeSee you should still add some extra validation and stripping on your frontend.
[11:36:13] <bdmc> https://fabrik.smartstartinc.net/js/jquery.dataTables.js
[11:36:26] <MikeSee> robertmaxrees: understood.
[11:37:05] <bdmc> and, from research, that might have something to do with a mismatch between column headers and columns.  However, as far as I can count, they match.
[11:37:19] <BillCriswell> bdmc: Would need to set up up a demo at jsfiddle.net probably. Also, I've had really good luck googling the errors exactly as they show up.
[11:37:50] <bdmc> BillCriswell: right, that's where I came up with the column header idea
[11:37:51] <robertmaxrees> when will they make an irc channel?!
[11:38:23] <BillCriswell> bdmc: Can you share the table html?
[11:38:36] <BillCriswell> Not in the channel but in a fiddle or something.
[11:39:30] <robertmaxrees> hrm, the developer doesn't have any contact info - just a form.
[11:40:01] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Smart person.
[11:40:24] <robertmaxrees> i just don't want to create a forum account to ask why they don't have an irc channel yet.
[11:40:37] <BillCriswell> If you don't then they win.
[11:41:03] <robertmaxrees> GH repo found!  wooo!
[11:42:21] <bdmc> certainly.  How about: https://dpaste.de/Qxah is the HTML and https://dpaste.de/Nb5v is the jQuery
[11:44:21] <BillCriswell> bdmc: Are you waiting till the content is loaded before you try to use the datatables?
[11:44:29] <BillCriswell> Looks like you're ajaxing it in maybe?
[11:44:33] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: swear to god if it wasnt for GH this channel wouldn't even be half its size
[11:45:08] <frank_o> <3 GH
[11:45:21] <phelix> If I have an a linkn <a href="#tab-3"> can I tell it to run a jquery function and return the href as the data to that function? If that makes any sense.
[11:45:28] <bdmc> BillCriswell: yes to the last
[11:46:10] <robertmaxrees> phelix huh?
[11:46:21] <robertmaxrees> you want to get the href when you clickthe link you mean
[11:46:21] <robertmaxrees> ?
[11:47:13] <BillCriswell> bdmc: You'd have to start datatables after the table is actually loaded. I'm thinking it's erroring out cause it sees all those <th> and only only td with a colspan of 2.
[11:47:32] <BillCriswell> bdmc: Might want to try colspan="8" as well?
[11:49:15] <bdmc> BillCriswell: Good point about colspan.  I took this and adapted it from running code here, but will definitely try changing that.
[11:50:07] <louism2wash> hey guys, can create a jquery selector that targets a place in the dom relative to other dom elements?  Something like $('h1:after')?  Thanks
[11:50:08] <doug_> MikeSee: http://jsfiddle.net/09k1b6gf/16/
[11:51:05] <bdmc> BillCriswell: nope.  no change.  However, looking at the DataTables documentation, I may be able to do it with many fewer parameters.  Let me go away and hack at some code.  Thanks.
[11:51:12] <BillCriswell> louism2wash: Do you want all the elements after an h2?
[11:51:24] <BillCriswell> bdmc: No problem.
[11:51:58] <BillCriswell> I'd try setting up something at jsfiddle.net with the actual html from the request for sanity. Good way to isalote things.
[11:52:05] <MikeSee> doug_: Ok, that looks more effective, but how would I have it work on the 4 center columns? (1,2,3,4) and still not (0,5)?
[11:52:18] <robertmaxrees> http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ is a great guide
[11:52:40] <MikeSee> Your example only does columns (1,2,3) and I'm not sure which part of your code denotes the columns to affect..
[11:52:56] <decx> slice(1,-1)
[11:53:00] <louism2wash> BillCriswell: No, I just want to target the area directly after the h1 so that I can insert things there.  Rather than create a div just to make it easy to target with a jquery selector I was wondering if I could make a selector that inserts stuff relative to another DOM element
[11:53:04] <MikeSee> Roger that
[11:53:10] <doug_> MikeSee: it already does. look
[11:53:36] <BillCriswell> louism2wash: Ah ok, then $('h1').after('<b>Some HTML</b>') would work.
[11:53:38] <decx> MikeSee doug_ http://jsfiddle.net/decx/09k1b6gf/17/
[11:53:49] <frank_o> robertmaxrees: oh indeed. somebody should put that in the topic
[11:54:18] <frank_o> calling all operators
[11:54:23] <BillCriswell> decx: I still like the one I did haha
[11:54:33] <robertmaxrees> hi frank_o ;)
[11:54:41] <frank_o> greetings !
[11:54:52] <robertmaxrees> louism2wash insert a div instead.
[11:55:00] <robertmaxrees> either write it in your html or use jquery.
[11:55:02] <decx> where do i have to scroll to to see what BillCriswell
[11:55:03] <louism2wash> BillCriswell: ok, but no way to save a reference like… var $after_h1 = $('h1:after')?  I know it's a bit overkill but I'm just wondering
[11:55:51] <BillCriswell> decx: I never posted it, just did it a while ago just using CSS to make the inputs look like plain text till they're focused.
[11:55:58] <MikeSee> doug_: thanks a lot.
[11:55:59] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: yeah, just trying to see how terse I can get with my HTML.  More of an exercise than anything else
[11:56:01] <MikeSee> decx: thanks as well
[11:56:04] <decx> ah right BillCriswell derp
[11:56:10] <BillCriswell> haha
[11:56:53] <decx> that would have been a long scroll though
[11:56:53] <robertmaxrees> louism2wash eeeh, i'd focus on writing good html, not terse ;)
[11:57:40] <BillCriswell> decx: True.
[11:58:43] <BillCriswell> louism2wash: You can't just save a spot in the DOM, needs to be an element. (How I think of it at least?)
[11:59:48] <robertmaxrees> is it possible to .bind() an iife so I can change `this` ?
[12:01:00] <shoky> sure
[12:01:19] <shoky> (function(){}.bind(meow))()
[12:02:39] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/5secgL25/
[12:03:32] <MikeSee> decx: in your version of my fiddle, http://jsfiddle.net/decx/09k1b6gf/17/, when you get to the if(status) {console.log()} portion, I get confused, how would I go aboutgetting the row data?  do I need to interate through the cells again, with the code above that has the slice() method and such?
[12:03:54] <shoky> (function(){}).bind(meow)()  also works
[12:03:57] <robertmaxrees> shoky thank you.  can't figure out why i didn't get that
[12:04:28] <robertmaxrees> one of those days
[12:05:06] <jakey> Hi robert
[12:06:07] <robertmaxrees> hey jakey
[12:26:12] <doug_> MikeSee: have a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/09k1b6gf/26/
[12:26:32] <doug_> I put the ugly border in for debugging btw
[12:27:13] <doug_> it captures edits and keeps an array as data on the row element
[12:27:20] <doug_> edits to the fields update the data
[12:30:26] <robertmaxrees> the more i use underscore, the more i love it.
[12:30:43] <BillCriswell> It's the bee's knees.
[12:30:52] <doug_> robertmaxrees: have you tried lodash?
[12:31:11] <robertmaxrees> yep.  we already have underscore in our codebase though so not about to change it out ;)
[12:31:56] <MikeSee> thanks doug_ I'll check it out
[12:34:59] <doug_> MikeSee: contenteditable is smooth from a user perspective, but the onus is on you to do things like limiting the length of the input and giving visual indication that the cell has become editable
[12:35:35] <MikeSee> understood, thanks for your fiddling. )
[12:35:40] <MikeSee> :)*
[12:35:45] <doug_> np
[12:48:48] <kinesis> can anyone tell me why my return values in function 'isVerified' are not operating as intended when called from my $(document).ready(function() {..}); ? http://pastie.org/private/7p29siekoz3g3razcd3sw
[12:50:10] <kinesis> something about using 'return' within a $.post inside a function? Is this incorrect?
[12:50:14] <kinesis> am i missing something here?
[12:50:28] <robertmaxrees> you're returning from the callback, but not from $.post()
[12:50:53] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to set a variable and return that instead.
[12:51:07] <robertmaxrees> though this reeks of race conditions - the ajax can complete after dom ready.
[12:51:16] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm i see what you're doing.
[12:51:32] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, you're not returning to the right place
[12:52:08] <kinesis> ok
[12:53:50] <doug_> kinesis: http://pastie.org/9614734
[12:55:19] <kinesis> http://pastie.org/private/nqyngwgvsfnp9npxr3hk6g
[12:55:21] <kinesis> so that?
[12:55:40] <doug_> kinesis: no not that
[12:55:42] <kinesis> ok
[12:55:59] <robertmaxrees> the code after the $.post() would run before the post actuall completed.
[12:56:08] <doug_> the $.post will return LONG before the request even gets sent
[12:56:31] <doug_> where LONG before = some number of microseconds :D
[12:56:34] <kinesis> how does that work, what you did
[12:56:38] <jquerynewbie> can someone fix this for me?  				$(this).css({'top':""this.attr(xyparts[1])+"'px','left':'"this.attr(xyparts[0])+"px"});
[12:56:45] <jquerynewbie> im so bad at these quotes
[12:57:08] <robertmaxrees> don't do that :(
[12:57:12] <doug_> kinesis: it passes a callback to call later, when the post result comes back. when it does, it calls the callback with the true/false
[12:57:26] <doug_> lol
[12:57:38] <kinesis> why did you take off the if on if(!isVerified
[12:57:59] <doug_> because it is way too early to know yet there
[12:58:24] <doug_> the post response might take 10 seconds to come back. it wont hang there for 10 seconds
[12:58:45] <kinesis> right.. asynchronious
[12:58:46] <robertmaxrees> jquerynewbie what are you trying to do?
[12:58:58] <jquerynewbie> fix my line of syntax
[12:59:00] <jquerynewbie> the quotes are wrong
[12:59:08] <robertmaxrees> jquerynewbie more than the quotes are wrong.
[12:59:14] <doug_> think of it this way: the code says, hey isVerified, go check this thing, then later, when you have the data I want, call this callback
[12:59:25] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to set the "top" css property to this.attr(xyparts[1]) ?
[12:59:30] <doug_> pass that data I want to the callback plz
[12:59:31] <jquerynewbie> yes
[12:59:36] <kinesis> it actually doesnt work...
[12:59:41] <kinesis> but hmm.
[13:00:13] <kinesis> it says im verified.. im not.. is_verified in mysql db for my phone number is 0 ('false')
[13:00:22] <robertmaxrees> jquerynewbie http://fixee.org/paste/9ph9e0t/ this is closer to what you want.
[13:00:23] <kinesis> should it be !isVerified
[13:00:36] <kinesis> or should i rename it to notVErified
[13:00:45] <kinesis> and switch the callback(true) with callback(false)
[13:00:48] <robertmaxrees> though what you actually want is probably http://fixee.org/paste/9ph9e0t/#url=3ngviaa
[13:01:24] <doug_> kinesis: there is a way that might feel more right to you...
[13:01:30] <doug_> kinesis: 1 sec
[13:01:47] <jquerynewbie> robertmaxrees: i got it working
[13:01:52] <kinesis> the ajax from check_phone.php is {response:"0"} if not verified and {response:"1"} if verified
[13:01:53] <jquerynewbie> just the quotes were wrong
[13:02:00] <kinesis> sorry the json, not the ajax :)
[13:03:24] <robertmaxrees> jquerynewbie you should use .prop(), not .attr() btw.
[13:04:25] <doug_> kinesis: http://pastie.org/9614758
[13:04:50] <kinesis> oh another thing, i forgot i did preventDefault in that code.. I changed my form to a submission
[13:04:56] <kinesis> I'll fix that
[13:07:00] <kinesis> oh wow thats cool
[13:11:44] <kinesis> That works but my form doesnt work now.
[13:13:24] <kinesis> I think I have to apply the same principle  again doug..
[13:14:19] <doug_> kinesis: any errors in console? remember than any uncaught exception will cause the browser to simply abandon running the script
[13:14:22] <kinesis> At line #27 http://pastie.org/private/oepludlleq461xhmruga
[13:14:29] <kinesis> the checkCode() doesnt launch
[13:14:34] <kinesis> wait, it does. sec
[13:14:56] <kinesis> Sorry imc onfusiong you
[13:15:09] <kinesis> It is line #7
[13:15:24] <kinesis> checkCode is not going off
[13:16:07] <doug_> line 6 should be passing the phone number, not {response:1}
[13:17:28] <doug_> kinesis: in that code, if the ajax fails, then nothing happens
[13:17:33] <kinesis> Right, I put mobile_number in there
[13:17:37] <kinesis> ok
[13:17:46] <doug_> kinesis: what does the network pane in debugger say for that POST response code?
[13:17:57] <doug_> 200 or some error code?
[13:18:01] <kinesis> none
[13:18:05] <kinesis> all my scripts are clean and ready
[13:18:36] <kinesis> they all return application/json
[13:19:11] <kinesis> i have console.log("checkCode()"); in the function checkCode()
[13:20:00] <kinesis> I see what this is.. it waits until isVerified is done
[13:20:26] <Omar-> !seen robert
[13:20:26] <b-ot> Omar-: I have never seen robert.
[13:20:58] <doug_> kinesis: checkCode won't get called until you submit the form
[13:21:31] <kinesis> I did click the submit button
[13:21:32] <BinaryKitten> anyone know why $('#formid').submit(false); would fail?
[13:21:37] <kinesis> and there is no checkCode() in my logs
[13:21:44] <Respek> I learned a new word! Thought I'd share with you all (is indeed OT): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence
[13:22:09] <doug_> Respek: yes, the word that PMs say a lot to sound as techie as the devs ;)
[13:22:57] <Respek> lolol I learned it via an article on automating the setup of a dev machine, but sounds about right too :)
[13:23:05] <kinesis> where would i add .error
[13:23:14] <kinesis> before the ); right
[13:23:27] <doug_> kinesis: .fail
[13:23:27] <kinesis> or after the ) between the ;
[13:23:30] <kinesis> .fail ok
[13:23:37] <doug_> kinesis: after the closing ) of the .done
[13:24:24] <doug_> kinesis: so you know what's going on better: the $.post returns a promise. you attach a success callback to the promise with .done, and you attach a failure allback to the promise with .fail
[13:25:27] <doug_> when the post actually completes (later) $.post either resolves or rejects the promise. if it resolves it, all the done handlers are called, if it rejects (fails) it all the fail handlers are called
[13:25:58] <kinesis> here is my .fail
[13:26:00] <kinesis> but i think it broke it
[13:26:01] <kinesis> http://pastie.org/private/v2bzej4gzlyaqy4lbvzkq
[13:26:08] <kinesis> line 18
[13:26:51] <doug_> kinesis: }).fail(function() { ..... });
[13:26:55] <kinesis> ok
[13:29:02] <kinesis> Hmm. checkCode still isnt triggering a console log when I click submit
[13:29:30] <kinesis> http://pastie.org/private/muvewdvzscfodadlgb32q
[13:31:25] <kinesis> /log/log start
[13:31:51] <HexAtWork> What is the best way to watch for value change on input? But..... the change occurs in js, so for ex: $("#input1").val('new val');
[13:32:25] <doug_> kinesis: side note: document.getElementById('verification_code').value   should be  $('#verification_code').val()
[13:32:45] <mdev> HexAtWork you have to check for change, and pastes
[13:32:55] <mdev> and key presses
[13:33:15] <HexAtWork> mdev: No.. the change occurs via js
[13:33:16] <doug_> kinesis: and document.getElementById('verification_code').value='';  should be $('$verification_code').val('')
[13:33:30] <HexAtWork> mdev: Which does not trigger events
[13:33:45] <doug_> oops $('#verification_code').val('')
[13:33:47] <mdev> $("#"+elem[i]).on('cut', function() {
[13:33:56] <mdev> $("#"+elem[i]).change( function(){
[13:34:04] <mdev> $("#"+elem[i]).keyup(function(event){
[13:34:13] <doug_> mdev: ? to get all changes use 'input' event
[13:34:14] <mdev> $("#"+elem[i]).on('paste', function () {
[13:34:33] <mdev> doug you sure that gets it all?
[13:34:47] <HexAtWork> mdev: When changing value with js it does not trigger any of these events
[13:35:06] <mdev> lame
[13:35:09] <doug_> HexAtWork: is that your problem? programmatic changes not firing events?
[13:35:16] <kinesis> I still cant get that submit on the enter_number form to call  checkCode(myText)
[13:35:19] <doug_> HexAtWork: that is easily worked around
[13:35:27] <HexAtWork> doug_: Do tell me
[13:35:29] <HexAtWork> How?
[13:35:31] <HexAtWork> Please
[13:35:49] <doug_> HexAtWork: $('#something').val('new value').trigger('change')
[13:36:05] <HexAtWork> doug_: I was hoping you won't suggest that
[13:36:06] <HexAtWork> But okay
[13:36:11] <HexAtWork> I guess that's what I have to do
[13:36:16] <HexAtWork> Thanks =]
[13:36:19] <kinesis> I think this is some kind of bug
[13:36:28] <kinesis> :|
[13:36:37] <doug_> HexAtWork: if it called you with programmatic changes we'd all have to bend over backward diferentiating user input from programmatic input
[13:36:38] <kinesis> it is the if (!data.response) {
[13:36:54] <doug_> HexAtWork: it would lead to a lot of infinite loops I think
[13:37:54] <kinesis> http://pastie.org/private/e5mqbqxa0pkovu4ral7q <- if i take the '!' off that if at line #7 it does something different. Maybe javascript doesn't see 0 and 1 as true false in if?
[13:38:00] <doug_> HexAtWork: well... you could add an extension method
[13:38:03] <kinesis> it is seeing 0 as true even
[13:39:33] <doug_> kinesis: because it is a string. try if (Number(data.response))
[13:40:02] <doug_> js> if ('0') print('yep, the string "0" is true')
[13:40:09] <b-ot> doug_: yep, the string "0" is true
[13:41:47] <doug_> js> print(0==false, '0'==false, Number('0') == false, +'0' == false)
[13:41:52] <b-ot> doug_: true true true true
[13:42:22] <doug_> weird right? thanks implicit conversions :|
[13:42:53] <kinesis> i still am having trouble getting my script to call that checkCode function
[13:42:58] <kinesis> when I submit the enter_code form
[13:43:30] <dipser> hello, how do I read a js-script with ajax if I go offline and have an application-cache? I get errors with ajax. everithing else is loaded.
[13:43:51] <kinesis> ill figure it out
[13:44:06] <doug_> kinesis: you fixed the '0' vs 0 thing
[13:44:07] <doug_> ?
[13:44:18] <dipser> GET http://â€¦..file.js net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED
[13:44:50] <kinesis> I don't think so
[13:45:11] <kinesis> enclosing it with Number() doesnt work
[13:45:29] <doug_> data.response is a string. converting a string to boolean results in true if length > 0
[13:45:47] <kinesis> oh
[13:46:29] <doug_> wrapping Number around it converts it to a number, so '0' gives 0. then converting 0 to boolean gives false
[13:46:52] <doug_> (if does the conversion to boolean btw)
[13:47:25] <doug_> put a console.log there where it uses data.response
[13:48:08] <doug_> or better yet, use console.dir
[13:48:20] <kinesis> if (!(Number(data.response))) {
[13:48:27] <kinesis> should I 'encapsulate' it like that ()
[13:48:39] <doug_> not necessary but harmless
[13:48:57] <kinesis> and that else becomes else if right
[13:49:05] <kinesis>  } else if (Number(data.response)) {
[13:49:16] <doug_> na, just else will be fine
[13:49:29] <doug_> it's the only other possibility
[13:50:21] <kinesis> http://pastie.org/9615020
[13:50:23] <doug_> you are seeing the POST requests in the browser debugger Network tab right?
[13:50:27] <kinesis> yea
[13:50:32] <kinesis> i get the SMS message
[13:50:44] <kinesis> i enter the code, I click verify, and the checkCode() function doesn't pop off
[13:51:39] <doug_> kinesis: remove the ! right? you want to allow the submit if data.response is true
[13:51:50] <doug_> nonzero
[13:53:05] <kinesis> THat causes the script to say im verified (when im not, mysql db is_verified is 0)
[13:53:48] <doug_> ah I see...
[13:54:07] <doug_> you are saying, if check_phone fails we have to show that form. if it succeeds then he already verified
[13:54:09] <kinesis> if data.response is "0" that means the phone number is not SMS verified. if it is "1" that means it is, and the form should vanish and say "You are validated"
[13:54:23] <kinesis> yeah
[13:54:32] <doug_> where "fails" means 0
[13:54:43] <doug_> k
[13:54:52] <kinesis> Oh my goodness im stupid
[13:54:57] <kinesis> I forgot to change button type to submit :)
[13:55:17] <doug_> I wouldnt go that far
[13:55:18] <kinesis> that's the reason
[13:55:51] <kinesis> Yeah it works fine now. Thanks.
[13:55:57] <doug_> np
[13:57:35] <kinesis> I learn best by taking notes and I got a lot of insight into jQuery from our conversation
[13:58:25] <doug_> glad I could help
[13:59:26] <doug_> HexAtWork: I'll show extension example
[14:03:46] <doug_> HexAtWork: http://jsfiddle.net/5wytce8k/
[14:04:00] <doug_> adds .valTrigger which calls val and trigger for you
[14:08:20] <HexAtWork> doug_: Oh thank you, but right after your suggestion I made it work
[14:08:24] <HexAtWork> So it's all good
[14:08:27] <HexAtWork> Thanks =]
[14:10:01] <doug_> sure, just throwing it out there that when you say "I wish jquery did X" you can probably make it do X with an extension :D
[14:11:52] <doug_> and it's mind-bogglingly easy to make jquery extensions. thanks jquery!
[14:17:21] <Hooloovoo> I'm ok with jQuery handling my dom manipulations... There are surprisingly few things i like to run as a jquery plugin.
[14:44:50] <jeffreylevesque> is there an easy way to clear a form (except elements with a certain property, readonly)?
[14:51:55] <doug_> jeffreylevesque: yes, reset it
[14:52:30] <doug_> jeffreylevesque: certain property? you mean attribute?
[14:53:52] <doug_> jeffreylevesque: $('#someform').find(':input').filter(function() { return $(this).attr('readonly'); })
[14:54:03] <doug_> or even using selector
[14:54:30] <doug_> jeffreylevesque: $('#someform').find(':input').not('[readonly]')
[14:54:44] <doug_> jeffreylevesque: $('#someform').find(':input').not('[readonly]').val('');
[14:55:37] <Kjellmann> Can someone help me with getting my slider responsive? I have tried something that you can see, but not responsive yet.. - http://jsfiddle.net/vfbbdr0y/1/
[14:55:48] <doug_> jeffreylevesque: $('#someform :input').not('[readonly]').val('');
[14:58:01] <doug_> Kjellmann: http://jsfiddle.net/vfbbdr0y/2/ ReferenceError: jssor_slider1_starter is not defined
[15:01:56] <doug_> Kjellmann: it's also a bad idea to sneak function calls into the html like <script>jssor_slider1_starter('slider');</script>
[15:09:57] <Kjellmann> doug_: Ok, then what to do?
[15:14:11] <doug_> Kjellmann: make that call in your js
[15:14:39] <doug_> that call is probably getting made too early - you need to wait for document ready don't you?
[15:16:29] <Kjellmann> doug_: I've made slider from a tutorial on Youtube tho.. Just wanted it to be responsive so I followed this online tutorial: http://www.jssor.com/development/tip-make-responsive-slider.html
[15:16:53] <doug_> jeffreylevesque: just call reset() on the form element. http://jsfiddle.net/tgod3hc6/
[15:21:50] <doug_> Kjellmann: see http://jsfiddle.net/vfbbdr0y/9/
[15:22:12] <doug_> if user agent is blah blah do nothing
[15:23:48] <doug_> Kjellmann: checking the user agent is a bad idea anyway imho
[15:24:17] <doug_> what makes your code so sure that those agents will always have a small screen?
[15:24:21] <robertLunch> yeah, "responsive" is based on screen sizes.
[15:27:10] <doug_> Kjellmann:  where's android on your list? once you fix that, what is the next agent that you need to detect? :)
[15:27:16] <Kjellmann> doug_: Thanks, but I still can't get it to resize tho..
[15:28:27] <Kjellmann> doug_: So what can I use that is better than checking the user agent?
[15:30:06] <Kjellmann> doug_: here is the clean code without the "responsive" coding - http://jsfiddle.net/vfbbdr0y/7/
[15:30:48] <Kjellmann> doug_: that works well, but does not resize in browser when minimizing
[15:34:00] <robertmaxrees> Kjellmann you should do everything you can in css instead.
[15:34:03] <robertmaxrees> using media queries.
[15:34:33] <robertmaxrees> and fyi - $(".slider #1") is totally unnecessary.  just do $('#1')
[15:40:01] <Kjellmann> robertmaxrees: thanks, yeah, probably should do that!
[15:40:11] <Kjellmann> should probably*
[15:40:33] <Kjellmann> robertmaxrees: that is noted :)
[15:43:30] <robertmaxrees> are you doing this as an exercize?
[15:43:52] <robertmaxrees> *exercise?  or is this for a real production stuff you're looking for?
[15:51:31] <jeffmjack_> anybody know why this is returning an empty array?   the selector is returning a jquery object.  myList = $("tbody tr td:nth-child(3)").map(function () { return $(this).text(); } ).get();
[15:52:11] <robertmaxrees> is it returning an element?
[15:52:31] <doug_> jeffmjack_: .get() ??
[15:52:37] <robertmaxrees> that converts it to an array, doug_
[15:52:49] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/map/ explains it.
[15:53:07] <jeffmjack_> well I'm console.logging just this: $("tbody tr td:nth-child(3)")
[15:53:23] <robertmaxrees> can you share a fiddle of your code?
[15:53:26] <jeffmjack_> and it's returning a big ugly-looking jquery object into the console
[15:53:26] <robertmaxrees> html and css?
[15:53:31] <litropy> I can't append <head>, can I
[15:53:36] <litropy> Using jQ
[15:53:44] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ check $("tbody tr td:nth-child(3)").length
[15:53:55] <doug_> robertmaxrees: ah right, I mostly use $.map when I map
[15:53:57] <jeffmjack_> well it's a node program actually but yeah if that's okay
[15:54:08] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ try the length trick i just pointed out.
[15:54:20] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't work -  just this: $("tbody tr td:nth-child(3)")
[15:54:20] <robertmaxrees> [2014:10:02:15:53:22] <robertmaxrees> can you share a fiddle
[15:54:21] <robertmaxrees> woops
[15:54:30] <doug_> litropy: you can append TO head though
[15:54:33] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn't work, http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[15:54:59] <jeffmjack_> doh
[15:55:12] <litropy> doug_, sweet thx
[15:55:14] <jeffmjack_> robertmaxrees: length is showing up as 0
[15:55:18] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[15:55:57] <jeffmjack_> so my selector is wrong...
[15:56:01] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:56:26] <jeffmjack_> i'm trying to pull the third column from this table
[15:56:26] <jeffmjack_> http://www.mongabay.com/cities_urban_01.htm
[15:57:38] <doug_> jeffmjack_: th isn't throwing it off?
[15:57:44] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ uh...
[15:58:08] <robertmaxrees> i'm noty seeing jquery defined on that page.
[15:58:28] <jeffmjack_> well I'm pulling in the html via node request()
[15:58:37] <jeffmjack_> and then using jquery on it via cheerio
[15:59:22] <jeffmjack_> doug_: th?
[15:59:25] <robertmaxrees> so you want the city column?
[15:59:30] <jeffmjack_> yeah
[16:00:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/oy7f78hv/
[16:00:35] <robertmaxrees> you've got something funky going on.
[16:01:33] <doug_> jeffmjack_: http://jsfiddle.net/hf3azaqv/
[16:02:02] <jeffmjack_> I can't find the console in jsfiddle :(
[16:02:09] <robertmaxrees> it's your browser consople.
[16:02:11] <robertmaxrees> normal dev tools
[16:02:25] <doug_> jeffmjack_: F12
[16:02:28] <doug_> probably
[16:02:29] <jeffmjack_> ah lol
[16:03:15] <jeffmjack_> robertmaxrees: yeah you're right
[16:03:23] <jeffmjack_> ok thanks! back to the coal mines
[16:03:35] <robertmaxrees> that page is tables nested in tables.
[16:03:44] <robertmaxrees> try to get that specific table only, then go from there.
[16:07:54] <stevew_> I have two checkboxes. I can attach an event handler to one but not the other. Why is that?
[16:08:18] <doug_> stevew_: must be doing it wrong
[16:08:38] <doug_> stevew_: I have seen invalid html cause that sort of weirdness too
[16:08:44] <stevew_> doug_: heh probably.
[16:09:00] <doug_> stevew_: show code?
[16:09:18] <robertmaxrees> also: does the broken one not exist on pageload?
[16:09:58] <stevew_> when I call getEventListeners in chrome, there's nothing
[16:10:19] <robertmaxrees> what does the event binding code look like?
[16:10:39] <robertmaxrees> also, jquery event listeners are distinct from native dom event listeners.
[16:11:29] <stevew_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/r2ATBHhx
[16:11:59] <robertmaxrees> you can only use an ID once per page.
[16:12:09] <stevew_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/feNYQ6iq
[16:13:14] <doug_> stevew_: it is illegal to have duplicate ids
[16:13:27] <doug_> stevew_: that code, by definition, only puts the handler on one element
[16:13:43] <stevew_> doug_: is label duplicating the id?
[16:13:59] <robertmaxrees> stevew_ didn't you say there aree two checkboxes?
[16:14:02] <doug_> stevew_: you are expecting it to do two checkboxes right? where's the other one
[16:14:09] <stevew_> doug_: i have a different handler for that
[16:14:17] <robertmaxrees> or is the issue that the handler doesn't run when the checkbox changes?
[16:14:28] <robertmaxrees> like when you click the label.
[16:14:30] <stevew_> there is no handler for that checkbox
[16:14:42] <doug_> stevew_: ok then, what's the problem?
[16:15:02] <stevew_> if I type that handler into console, then it'll work
[16:15:10] <robertmaxrees> does the element exist on pageload?
[16:15:25] <robertmaxrees> is your js in a document ready?  etc.
[16:15:49] <stevew_> yes I can find the checkbox and attach a handler through the console
[16:16:13] <stevew_> js is in document ready
[16:16:23] <robertmaxrees> could you share all of your js then?
[16:18:12] <stevew_> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/FjvIBWso
[16:18:28] <stevew_> so the second handler works
[16:18:35] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:18:51] <robertmaxrees> could you setup a jsfiddle?  something isn't adding up,  i feel like you're leaving out some markup or something.
[16:25:22] <stevew_> ok thanks, I'll try to reproduce this in jsfiddle
[16:56:28] <stevew_> robertmaxrees: ah looks like the problem is due to handlers on parent div
[16:56:34] <robertmaxrees> mmk.
[18:10:23] <d4rklit3> anyone ever try $("vide").append("<source src='etc.mp4' />") on ios... seems to do nothing
[18:10:29] <d4rklit3> *video
[18:30:29] <P0rk> $("video").prop("src","./etc.mp4"); ?
[18:34:02] <openyk> anyone know how to pass variables from a dialog box into the main document or modify document elements like #image from javascript in the dialog box?
[18:34:53] <openyk> simple case of $('image').attr('value', 'test'); not working forthat reason
[18:35:08] <openyk> i mean $('#image')*
[18:35:20] <P0rk> is value an attribute of image?
[18:35:25] <openyk> yes it is
[18:35:32] <openyk> and when I run that code in the document js, it works
[18:35:57] <P0rk> what kind of object is "#image"?
[18:36:31] <openyk> a normal <input id="image" class="w400" type="text" value="" name="image">
[18:37:09] <openyk> I tried storing the data in jQuery.data( document.body, "test", file_route); but no dice
[18:37:16] <P0rk> sidenote, it's not a good idea to use the "image" reserve word for an ID or input name, but that's beside the point
[18:37:37] <P0rk> can you paste your code to jsfiddle?
[18:37:49] <openyk> true, easy to get mixed up with that. I'll change it after this.
[18:38:21] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can recommend a horizontal page slider that loads content via ajax next slide as it goes forward?
[18:38:39] <openyk> I also tried working with a close event for the dialog box but not quite sure what the syntax would be
[18:39:17] <P0rk> openyk, how long is a piece of string? It's a lot like the question you are asking. Without knowing a lot more about your situation, who knows?
[18:40:09] <P0rk> Forbidd3n, why not try to code one yourself?
[18:40:30] <Forbidd3n> P0rk: I am doing that with scrollTo, but was trying to save time
[18:40:31] <openyk> this is the dialog function in the main page http://jsfiddle.net/6tfsdeex/1/
[18:41:24] <openyk> and this is the function from the dialog page http://jsfiddle.net/jtanxjwh/
[18:42:11] <openyk> I hope that sheds light on the situation that the string is in
[18:42:39] <P0rk> rough...lines 12 and 13 say parent.$('#......
[18:43:02] <P0rk> doesn't look right to me...not an  expert though.
[18:43:12] <P0rk> where is parent defined
[18:44:12] <openyk> firebug confirms that the parent is the jquery window in which the #dialog container exists
[18:44:18] <shoky> parent === window  unless you're in an iframe :\
[18:44:18] <P0rk> And I am just not sure at all about how to use iframes, so I'm no help there
[18:44:31] <shoky> openyk it sounds like you're confusing dialogs, pages, and iframes
[18:44:40] <P0rk> does window have a .$ method?
[18:44:47] <shoky> openyk, a jquery-ui dialog is just an element on the same page. there's no "parent"
[18:45:09] <openyk> <div class="ui-dialog ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all ui-front ui-draggable ui-resizable" style="position: absolute; height: auto; width: 900px; top: 295px; left: 471px; display: none;" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-describedby="dialog" aria-labelledby="ui-id-2"> that is the parent
[18:45:13] <shoky> it shares the same DOM with the page that opened it
[18:45:23] <openyk> and the #dialog is a div element within the parent
[18:45:42] <shoky> why are you doing  parent.$('#dialog')   ?
[18:45:44] <shoky> what is "parent" ?
[18:45:49] <openyk> exactly it shares the same DOM which is why it's confusing why it's not working
[18:45:54] <P0rk> that's what I was asking?
[18:46:15] <shoky> P0rk it would make some sense maybe if it was in an iframe. cause there, parent === the parent window
[18:46:47] <shoky> i suspect major copypasta
[18:47:10] <tw2113> mmm italian code
[18:47:24] <Forbidd3n> P0rk: would you recommend scrollTo or is there a better method to doing it?
[18:47:30] <shoky> you with your food again
[18:47:39] <openyk> no it was working code, I just updated a few plugins and hazam not working
[18:47:52] <shoky> working !== correct
[18:48:28] <openyk> that is true shoky, very true. I'm trying to make it all nicer from the previous iteration, with a focus on editability
[18:48:41] <tw2113> i still have pasta left over too shoky
[18:48:49] <shoky> ok, then answer our questions.
[18:48:58] <tw2113> return true;
[18:49:11] <P0rk> Forbidd3n, that's really hard to say without knowing what the rest of your code looks like. It's like you are asking, "I plan to go somewhere on skates, is that a bad idea?"
[18:49:25] <shoky> tw2113 you're lucky i'm overgorged on burger
[18:49:39] <shoky> cheezeburger, that is
[18:49:47] <Forbidd3n> P0rk: generally speaking - to scroll to next page/section use scrollTo or is there another jquery function that does it?
[18:50:11] <openyk> parent is the div container in which the dialog container exists
[18:50:21] <shoky> parent is a <div>  ?
[18:50:26] <openyk> yup
[18:50:33] <shoky> then how are you doing parent.$('#..')
[18:50:43] <shoky> doesn't make any sense. where did you set "parent" to be that <div> ?
[18:50:47] <P0rk> using ajax, to load the content, there might not need to be a scrollTo involved. You could fadeTo or what have you depending on how the next "page" is being loaded.
[18:50:54] <tw2113> with or without bacon
[18:51:00] <shoky> with plz
[18:51:06] <tw2113> weirdo
[18:51:10] <shoky> omg.
[18:51:28] <P0rk> If you load the next content before appending it to the dom, then append it in a div off screen, you would animate the div on to the viewport
[18:52:05] <openyk> wait that's a good question where is this parent coming from its not a .parent() jquery function
[18:52:18] <shoky> heh
[18:52:31] <openyk> did I delete the support code...
[18:52:52] <P0rk> Forbidd3n, see what I am getting at. It depends on how and where you are attaching the ajax-loaded content.
[18:54:37] <openyk> ok I will inspect the code deeper and return with clearer analysis. I need to take a meeting atm. cya in a bit
[18:55:00] <P0rk> And personally, Forbidd3n, scrollTo might be difficult to manage because your destination is going to keep changing every time you load new content. If you scroll back a page (assuming you load sequentially) it'll be a different scrollTo dest
[18:55:06] <shoky> better yet make a jsfiddle with no php that actually shows your problem, openyk
[18:55:26] <openyk> k will do.
[18:58:11] <shoky> P0rk as to your question if window has a .$  yes it does, how do you think you're using jquery all the time calling $('#meow')  :P
[18:58:35] <shoky> (window is the global object)
[18:58:44] <Forbidd3n> P0rk: so that is why I am asking for a recommendation to a different approach...
[19:00:14] <P0rk> shoky, guess I never thought of the scope of the global object. I figured he meant $("#something").parent();
[19:00:42] <shoky> i just mean, generally,  $ === window.$
[19:00:54] <P0rk> never heard or seen anyone use 'parent' though.
[19:01:11] <shoky> only useful in an iframe, it points to the parent's window object
[19:01:23] <shoky> e.g. if the iframe wants to use the parent page's  jQuery
[19:01:38] <shoky> then you'd do  parent.$('#whatever')  to search in the parent page
[19:02:21] <P0rk> yeah, iframes are still spooky territory for me. They seem "hacky" to me. <--superstitious i guess
[19:02:22] <shoky> cause $('#whatever')  would search in the iframe. assuming the iframe even has jquery included as well
[19:02:44] <P0rk> makes perfect sense. Thanks
[19:02:58] <shoky> ;]
[20:28:35] <openyk> k im back and apparently I solved the problem after going thru it in detail. thanks for pointing me in the right direct guys.
[20:29:20] <openyk> to modify elements in the page using javascript in an iframe: $('#image', parent.document.body).attr('value', file_route);
[20:29:46] <openyk> and with that, I'm off. cheers and gnight.
[21:39:31] <R13ose> how do I get smooth scrolling when I click the links in the nav as I have with the arrow at the bottom of the screen?  Site: http://plushinteractive.ca/vr/  Code: http://pastebin.com/XL5epC5f
[21:46:04] <speaker123> is it acceptable to have json filenames with multiple dots?   $.getJSON('this.is.my.filename.json')
[21:51:46] <R13ose> I updated my code and seem to work thanks
[21:56:13] <doug_> speaker123: dots are fine
[21:56:31] <speaker123> yeah i was bit by json's silly decision not to allow NaN
[21:56:44] <speaker123> ...so my jquery was rejecting the json
[21:57:01] <speaker123> ...how can one know if a .getJSON succeeds? i'd like an error
[21:57:38] <doug_> speaker123: NaN isn't even a value - there are billions of values that are all "NaN"
[21:58:08] <doug_> a NaN is an infinity with a nonzero mantissa
[21:58:34] <speaker123> doug_, why is that relevant?
[21:58:56] <doug_> speaker123: because it would be nonsense for JSON to have NaN since NaN represents billions of different possible values
[21:59:04] <speaker123> doug_, i was just pointing out that when dealing with numerics, NaN values are useful
[21:59:15] <speaker123> doug_, its not the particular value...its that it is NaN
[21:59:22] <doug_> they could however have encoded the mantissa as NaN(...some hex or something...) but they didnt
[22:00:23] <speaker123> e.g. many js plotting libraries leave out points that have the value NaN
[22:00:43] <speaker123> its a pain to convert NaN to "NaN" and then back again, just so you can transmit over JSON
[22:01:33] <doug_> speaker123: yes, it's unfortunate
[22:01:58] <speaker123> i think inf is the same
[22:02:04] <speaker123> even more unfortunately
[22:02:13] <doug_> yeah, the designer of json didn't know IEEE754 well enough
[22:03:22] <speaker123> looks like it might also be a security risk since Infinity and NaN arent' special in js? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1423081/json-left-out-infinity-and-nan-json-status-in-ecmascript
[22:03:49] <cliffreich> guys im having an issue with jquery ui, i cant get it to show the response. the data i fine but for some reason it wont show anything.
[22:04:06] <doug_> js doesn't need to make them special - that's done in hardware by IEEE754 compliant processors
[22:05:43] <doug_> perhaps you mean parseFloat etc not supporting it properly... in that case yes
[22:06:33] <doug_> js> print(parseFloat('Inf'))
[22:06:39] <b-ot> doug_: NaN
[22:06:48] <doug_> lol
[22:07:53] <doug_> js> print(parseFloat('1e9999999'))
[22:07:58] <b-ot> doug_: Infinity
[22:08:41] <doug_> speaker123: for a laugh ^
[22:09:17] <speaker123> hah
[22:09:47] <doug_> js> print(parseFloat('e'))
[22:09:52] <b-ot> doug_: NaN
[22:10:07] <doug_> hmm, a hack might be to encode the NaN as 'e'
[22:10:25] <doug_> since e could be a valid character. it would be outside spec but might work
[22:10:29] <doug_> at least a little
[22:12:25] <Cork> speaker123: to answer your original question $.getJSON().fail(function(xhr, status, error) {})
[22:13:09] <speaker123> doh
[22:15:24] <speaker123> js> parseFloat('')
[22:15:28] <b-ot> speaker123: No output.
[22:15:38] <speaker123> js> print(parseFloat(''))
[22:15:43] <b-ot> speaker123: NaN
[22:15:50] <speaker123> js> print(isNaN(''))
[22:15:54] <b-ot> speaker123: false
[22:16:04] <doug_> boom, universe explodes
[22:17:01] <speaker123> haha
[22:19:59] <doug_> speaker123: meaning - never use isNaN, use that equality trick
[22:20:09] <doug_> it would have worked for ''
[22:21:14] <doug_> thanks IEEE754 NaN comparison semantics! :D
[22:22:43] <doug_> wait, no it wouldnt have worked
[22:25:19] <cliffreich> anyone to help, im even sending a string array to response as response(array) but this piece of shit wont show any result... nothing at all . and there are plenty of strings right there
[22:30:22] <cliffreich> no?
[22:40:13] <beyondlogical> I could use some insight into an animation issue: http://jsfiddle.net/cbaw0m0r/2/
[22:59:14] <beyondlogical> I could use some insight into an animation issue: http://jsfiddle.net/cbaw0m0r/2/
[23:21:37] <Technodrome> is there a good way in jquery I can set the scroll position based on the bottom of another div?
[23:22:15] <Cork> Technodrome: position().top + .outerHeight()
[23:23:12] <Technodrome> hmm
[23:23:16] <Technodrome> Iâ€™m curious how to implement this
[23:25:33] <Cork> var elm = $('#related-element'); $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: elm.position().top + elm.outerHeight() }, 1000)
[23:26:22] <Technodrome> i guess i also want that attached to an onclick method which happens, so when it happens , this other animation happens, then i want the screen to scroll to the bottom of that div
[23:26:41] <Technodrome> maybe his is easier than i think
[23:33:47] <Technodrome> Cork: do you do this alot?
[23:33:59] <Cork> Technodrome: not really
[23:34:22] <Technodrome> sometimes it seems so complicated but its only 3 lines of javascript
[23:38:31] <beyondlogical> Adding a series of elements dynamically and trying to animate each in turn, but for some reason they all seem to get bound...
[23:38:39] <beyondlogical> what am I missing? http://jsfiddle.net/cbaw0m0r/2/
[23:40:00] <Cork> beyondlogical: you shouldn't use setInterval like that
[23:41:40] <beyondlogical> I'm open to suggestions...
[23:42:29] <Cork> beyondlogical: set a timeout after you've done your first animation
[23:42:46] <Cork> setInterval fires ones aproximatly every 600ms
[23:43:12] <Cork> but if the computer gets busy for any reason the old animation might not have been completed yet
[23:43:26] <Cork> resulting in code queuing up
[23:44:22] <beyondlogical> The setInterval handles the gradual addition of the characters, which works fine as-is
[23:44:23] <Cork> beyondlogical: also inline elements will align there baselines
[23:44:44] <Cork> beyondlogical: as long as nothing makes the old code take more then 600ms
[23:45:02] <Cork> then you would have code running without delay
[23:49:07] <beyondlogical> OK, baseline was the issue. Got it working with divs floated left, thanks for pointing that out Cork
[23:49:24] <Cork> beyondlogical: the setInterval is another issue
[23:49:28] <Cork> and you should fix that too
