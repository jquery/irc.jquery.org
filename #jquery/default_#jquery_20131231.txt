[00:04:44] <_dinken> I've a portfolio site with four buttons and i change a div content while these buttons are clicked. Right now, i'm implementing it as a single page site with hide/show div elements on button click. But i want to use django and give url to these divs. How can i do that?
[00:05:28] <_dinken> say, xyz.com/portfolio should show the portfolio div
[00:05:53] <_dinken> and xyz.com/about should show 'about' div
[00:06:03] <_dinken> but all these are essentially in a single page
[00:07:32] <_dinken> help anyone?
[00:32:09] <shadykhan> can someone help me figure this out http://jsfiddle.net/LmAEA/ . im trying to get the highest index and value
[00:35:30] <duckgoose> shadykhan http://jsfiddle.net/nad2n/1/ hows that
[00:36:05] <shadykhan> duckgoose, thank you so much how can i also grab the index to go with it so it will be social 5?
[00:36:06] <duckgoose> http://jsfiddle.net/nad2n/2/ ***
[00:36:17] <duckgoose> hang on
[00:54:20] <shadykhan> duckgoose, thanks again for helping me
[01:10:31] <duckgoose> shadykhan are you trying to sort the object
[01:11:11] <shadykhan> duckgoose, no i just need the pair of the highest index and value so i just want Social 5 according to the array
[01:18:10] <duckgoose> http://jsfiddle.net/nad2n/4/
[01:18:31] <duckgoose> theres probably a better way of accomplishing this though
[01:21:55] <duckgoose> like using an actual array rather than object literals
[01:22:14] <duckgoose> and then just .sort() that
[01:22:35] <shadykhan> duckgoose, thank you so much you are a life saver
[01:41:27] <shacks> Please can someone tell me how to make a dropdown disappear when focus is lost e.g. click elsewhere on window
[01:46:21] <fabioportieri> shacks: on() 'blur'
[01:46:54] <shacks> thanks fabio!
[01:47:12] <fabioportieri> you're welcome
[01:48:49] <miCSu> I'm implementing a sortable "list" http://jsfiddle.net/Tcy3a/ where you can drop items as another one's child. Just wondering if it would be possible to also move the elements that are the ui.item's children? Of course there's the possibility to use loop to find all the nexts with higher input[name^='lvl'] but the change in lvl should also be calculated
[01:51:01] <bigbugjava> <li><a href="fileupload/fileupload.html" target="_blank" ><i class="icon-camera pull-right"></i>Add Photos</a></li> - Any reason for it not to trigger? if I click, right mouse click->Open new target, it does work!
[01:52:21] <fabioportieri> check for console errors
[01:52:41] <bigbugjava> fabioportieri none
[01:54:27] <fabioportieri> works in a jsfiddle
[01:54:41] <bigbugjava> fabioportieri  maybe change to onclick and let javascript handle it?
[01:55:08] <doug65536> bigbugjava: never use onclick
[01:55:19] <fabioportieri> inline js is bad practice
[01:56:55] <bigbugjava> really? what to use then?
[01:57:10] <fabioportieri> what do you want to achieve
[01:57:12] <doug65536> bigbugjava: fix it
[01:57:26] <doug65536> bigbugjava: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/69ayA/
[01:57:53] <bigbugjava> also getting Error "SyntaxError: Unexpected token S" on every jQuery File Upload, but file does gets uploaded to amazon s3
[01:58:18] <bigbugjava> doug65536 yeah wierd
[01:59:41] <doug65536> bigbugjava: validate your html. invalid html can cause all sorts of weird things
[02:01:08] <bigbugjava> doug65536 sry for asking maybe stupid questions, but what can I validate? it's just a very very simple link
[02:01:34] <fabioportieri> validate the entire page
[02:01:57] <doug65536> bigbugjava: http://validator.w3.org/
[02:01:58] <bigbugjava> just tried something, if I put it outside of the ul, it works
[02:04:26] <bigbugjava> my ul, has a active js on it, can cause it?
[02:05:11] <fabioportieri> if the js is broken, of course
[02:09:07] <bigbugjava> Element li not allowed as child of element aside in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree
[02:09:15] <bigbugjava> on that place
[02:10:27] <bigbugjava> fabioportieri removed the <li> items, and it works, but it broke the css completely
[02:10:51] <fabioportieri> yeah no shit...
[02:10:55] <fabioportieri> did you validate?
[02:11:11] <fabioportieri> ah yes
[02:11:36] <fabioportieri> wasn't your li inside a ul?
[02:11:44] <bigbugjava> yeah
[02:11:52] <bigbugjava> still is, but li breaks the code
[02:12:08] <doug65536> bigbugjava: go to http://jsfiddle.net/ and paste in the whole ul, save it, and paste the link here
[02:12:08] <bigbugjava> so I remove it from that, and it works, but no css rules are applied to that
[02:12:09] <fabioportieri> paste the whole page i ll take a look
[02:12:38] <bigbugjava> http://jsfiddle.net/mWPK2/
[02:12:45] <bigbugjava> this one works with bad css
[02:13:16] <fabioportieri> <aside class=" ??
[02:13:36] <fabioportieri> the validator doesn't complain for your custom tag?
[02:13:44] <Uhkis> it's html5
[02:14:00] <bigbugjava> no he doesn't
[02:14:11] <fabioportieri> uh ok
[02:14:40] <Uhkis> http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/aside

[02:16:39] <bigbugjava> hehehe it's Hebrew
[02:16:40] <bigbugjava> ;)
[02:17:25] <Uhkis> bigbugjava: line #9 has bad html
[02:17:48] <Uhkis> ..or it's the hebrew
[02:17:59] <bigbugjava>  <link href="css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">?

[02:18:41] <bigbugjava> thats what is there..

[02:26:10] <joumunji> Can someone please share their expertise, I'm using JS to change a div from absolute to fixed in conjunction with parallax scrolling but it is always 2 pixels off when the position changes
[02:26:16] <joumunji> example here: http://codingmylifeaway.com
[02:56:06] <bigbugjava> hi again, I'm using Jquery file upload, all works great, the file goes to amazon s3, but when finishing progress, I get to Error SyntaxError: Unexpected token S and not completed.
[03:00:11] <joumunji> PHP?
[03:00:11] <joumunji> What size is the file
[03:00:20] <joumunji> It works fine on local?
[03:03:17] <doug65536> bigbugjava: it is not legal for <img> to be a child of <ul>
[03:06:17] <doug65536> bigbugjava: you have a syntax error. can't help without seeing the code
[03:08:01] <new_learner> what is jQuery('#painel_ondas_imagens_galeria').fadeOut(0).html(data[3]).fadeIn(tempo_alteracao);  doing?/

[04:00:05] <Lope> I'm trying to create an independent clone of an object so that when I pass the clone into a function and that function mutates the object it doesn't mutate the original object. I'm using var tmpObj = $.extend({},originalObj); and it's not working.
[04:02:08] <fabioportieri> what's wrong with $.clone ?
[04:03:46] <Lope> Oh I've never heard of it. I'm new to jquery
[04:04:50] <Lope> The .clone() method performs a deep copy of the set of matched elements
[04:04:58] <Lope> that's for elements. I need to clone a JSON object.
[04:05:39] <_rgn> (there's no such thing as JSON object)
[04:06:17] <duckgoose> you need to clone a json object?
[04:06:40] <Lope> a normal javascript object
[04:07:19] <duckgoose> var clone = jsonobject;
[04:07:30] <_rgn> Lope: why didn't $.extend work?
[04:07:46] <_rgn> duckgoose: that is not a clone
[04:08:06] <Lope> I don't know it just didn't. when I mutated the cloned object my original got mutated.
[04:08:17] <_rgn> seems to work for me
[04:08:21] <duckgoose> that is a new instance of an object, _rgn
[04:08:29] <duckgoose> no better definition of clone
[04:08:48] <_rgn> it's a reference, not a new instance
[04:09:26] <Lope> I used the JSON cloning method now, it works.
[04:09:40] <_rgn> stringify & parse?
[04:09:56] <duckgoose> clone is a new object all it's own
[04:10:08] <duckgoose> and it's value does not affect jsonobject
[04:10:23] <duckgoose> try it for yourself
[04:10:40] <joumunji> My div keeps moving 2 pixels left whenever I change it from absolute to fixed. Any suggestions? I've got no margin, no padding
[04:11:16] <joumunji> code: http://codingmylifeaway.com#help
[04:12:35] <_rgn> duckgoose: maybe you can make a jsfiddle of that
[04:13:30] <joumunji> ok
[04:13:31] <joumunji> oen sec
[04:18:25] <joumunji> http://jsfiddle.net/3hck9/
[04:35:24] <_biff> could it be that i get a parse error if i post an url or url (with paramters) in json?

[05:15:49] <aibo> hey guys
[05:22:59] <aibo> i'm trying to bind a external function to an event and pass the event-data to the external function, but i seem to get something wrong passing the event... i need to use an external function as a handler to later unbind the specific handler... here are the two examples: http://pastebin.com/BtLMhkTW
[05:23:54] <aibo> maybe someone has an idea why the event object is only passed in webkit, i'm referring to the documentation at: http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[05:32:38] <JapieDay> ok, so i've got http://pitchupmedia.nl/index.php going, which contains a button in the top menu, called "TestButt" in http://pitchupmedia.nl/js/parallax.js there is a script supposed to be scrolling towards my div with id "overons" but is doesn't animate the way i want it to and just goes directly towards that point
[05:35:58] <aibo> JapieDay: use e:preventDefault()
[05:36:26] <JapieDay> aibo:  thanks, where exactly?
[05:37:01] <Lope> I'm trying to do regex that will validate numbers that can either be without a decimal point, or have 1 or 2 decimal places. this is my regex, valid example numbers would be 12, 12.3, 123.45 /[0-9]+(\.[0-9][0-9]?)?/ its not working for numbers with decimal places
[05:37:17] <fabioportieri> Lope: #regex
[05:45:35] <Lope> thanks, solved.
[05:51:13] <JapieDay> does anybody else know where i would use that line?
[06:20:40] <bigbugjava> Hi, I need an image slider that can display small images on preview and when click display image full as uploaded, or one that can center my 940px on 400px slider that works right now, just to note: I get pictures dynamicly from amazon s3, and have no control on picture width and height.
[06:22:36] <Juc1> hi all newbie question please - this snippet http://pastebin.com/NYF4vD80 works ok to make my class clickable but can anyone please tell me how to change the cursor to a hand in the clickable area ie to indicate that it is clickable? I think it is along the lines of $('selector').css( 'cursor', 'pointer' ); but I am not sure how this integrates with my existing snippet
[06:26:07] <aibo> .
[06:26:32] <BinaryKitten> Juc1 can you create a jsfiddle..
[06:27:19] <BinaryKitten> just wondering if some of that js is needed, like the double find etc
[06:31:22] <Wranorn> Anyone know of a way to determine if IE supports a specific mime type on demand?  can do it in other browsers with some simple js but IE,... as alwys,.. is a bit lacking.
[06:32:25] <synax> hey allâ€”I'm facing an issue where I'm trying to set a CSS property and jQuery seems to be constantly setting its shorthand: http://jsfiddle.net/q7aga/
[06:32:59] <synax> I can't seem to Google-fu an explanation as to why...
[06:33:07] <synax> would appreciate any insight
[06:33:43] <Wranorn> synapt what are you trying to accomplish?
[06:33:55] <Wranorn> synax*
[06:34:17] <synax> if you look at my fiddle and inspect the element I'm setting the AnimationDuration for, you'll see it simply sets the "animation" shorthand
[06:34:51] <synax> which is obviously overriding all the specific animation properties I have set in my styleshee
[06:36:33] <Wranorn> should be animation-duration ... no?
[06:36:33] <synax> doesn't make a difference
[06:36:33] <synax> either AnimationDuration or animation-duration are accepted
[06:36:33] <synax> both set the shorthand where I'd expect the exact property instead...
[06:36:34] <jphase> synax: .css will set inline css properties so that's the expected behavior. What are you wanting to do instead?
[06:36:41] <synax> jphase: but it's setting "animation" versus "animation-duration"
[06:36:51] <jphase> oic
[06:37:37] <Wranorn> i think its just the representation
[06:37:56] <aibo> synax: since version 1.8 jquery sets the vendor specific prefix, if i remember correctly
[06:38:20] <Asmooh> i have really strange question and i dont even know if it works
[06:39:48] <Asmooh> i build an function i can do this: onClick="jqmPushscreen('test3.html','test3','#content');"      (page to load, page id, and to what div it should load)  .. this works perfect but ofc the page ¨url¨ what you see in the adresbar is te same, is there a way to change the visible part to like website/test3 just for the users feeling he or she left the page and is somewhere else.. without really changing the site at all
[06:40:01] <Asmooh> i can do a 4th param with like visible url thats ok :)
[06:42:35] <synax> aibo: that's not my issue
[06:44:06] <Asmooh> hm
[06:44:11] <Asmooh> i think i fixed it already :)
[06:44:14] <synax> Asmooh: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History
[06:44:42] <Asmooh> nah that was not really what i ment
[06:45:13] <synax> replaceState will change the visible URL without issuing a request or modifying the users' history
[06:46:42] <Asmooh> hm ic i missed that one i guess
[06:46:50] <synax> Wranorn: it appears to be a Webkit issueâ€¦ Firefox sets the duration as I'd expect
[06:47:20] <synax> this blows
[06:48:11] <aibo> synax: ah now i understand
[06:48:28] <aibo> animation vs animation-duration... sorry
[06:48:35] <synax> yup
[06:48:43] <jphase> yeah, it looks like it shorthands the animation properties now
[06:48:46] <jphase> :[
[06:48:58] <jphase> even with object notation
[06:49:22] <synax> jphase: I'm only seeing it in Chrome (Canary, to be exactâ€”haven't test stable)
[06:49:40] <synax> it *used* to work in Chrome
[06:49:53] <Juc1> BinaryKitten: ok thanks I am off to jsfiddle...
[06:49:54] <jphase> yeah I just updated last night, seeing the same
[06:50:28] <synax> Safari gets it wrong too
[06:50:39] <jphase> even if you set animation as well as animation-duration it puts them all into one short hand css
[06:50:44] <synax> yup
[06:50:51] <synax> really annoying
[06:50:55] <aibo> synax: used to work with the same jquery version?
[06:51:13] <synax> aibo: used to work with Chrome
[06:51:32] <synax> was also an older version of jQuery (1.6.4 IIRC) that I had to add my own vendor prefix for
[06:51:35] <Asmooh> yup works :) just needed to delete my default push screen
[06:51:36] <jphase> synax: is it not possible to add in your animation css in jQuery?
[06:52:00] <synax> jphase: this doesn't seem to be a jQuery problem afterall
[06:53:03] <synax> jphase: observe: http://jsfiddle.net/q7aga/1/
[06:53:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you around?
[06:53:22] <jphase> hah
[06:53:26] <jphase> interesting
[06:53:51] <Asmooh> hm it does accept a /page/page/page structure
[06:53:59] <Asmooh> but there i can live with :)
[06:54:55] <aibo> synax: and why not use animation in general?
[06:55:39] <synax> aibo: because I need to set a specific property and let the rest inherit
[06:56:11] <aibo> synax: then buffer the orignal animation property, modify your value and set it again
[06:56:36] <synax> that involves parsing a string to pull out the right value
[06:56:48] <synax> otherwise I'd have to hardcode it, which is crap
[06:56:58] <synax> anywhoâ€”not a jQuery issue
[07:00:37] <aibo> synax: problem solved: http://jsfiddle.net/q7aga/1/
[07:00:55] <synax> aibo: bad link?
[07:01:10] <aibo> synax: it doesn't override the animation statement, only the set parament
[07:01:22] <aibo> didn't save
[07:01:24] <aibo> moment pls
[07:01:26] <synax> k
[07:01:38] <aibo> synax: http://jsfiddle.net/q7aga/2/
[07:02:36] <aibo> the duration parameter is overwritten but the rest like the animation itself and looping-type will stay
[07:03:07] <synax> aibo: doesn't work for me
[07:03:16] <synax> aibo: http://jsfiddle.net/q7aga/3/
[07:03:29] <synax> I just changed the values so they were more noticable
[07:03:40] <synax> you can see it's running over 5s, not 1s
[07:04:42] <aibo> i'm in chrome Version 31.0.1650.63 m ... works like a charm
[07:04:50] <aibo> same in safari
[07:05:03] <synax> Version 34.0.1753.0 canary here
[07:05:25] <aibo> mhm...
[07:05:27] <synax> testing in stable...
[07:05:54] <aibo> http://jsfiddle.net/q7aga/4/ <- tested in latest safari&Chrome
[07:05:58] <synax> ok, works in stable
[07:06:01] <aibo> (stable)
[07:06:18] <synax> Canaryâ€¦more trouble than it's worth some days ;)
[07:08:08] <synax> aibo: appreciate the help
[07:08:47] <aibo> pretty interesting, no problem
[07:15:50] <aibo> bye
[07:22:27] <Whirl3d> Hey all. Could someone explain to me the concept behind this: var b=function () {}; b.prototype.doSomething=function (a) {}   ?
[07:23:13] <jphase> Whirl3d: yeah, you're setting a function and adding a method to it called doSomething
[07:23:29] <jphase> then you could use it like, b.doSomething(params);
[07:23:51] <Whirl3d> but if b is a function.... I could still do b()
[07:24:16] <jphase> yeah, but the prototype is to add a method belonging to that function/object
[07:24:20] <Whirl3d> var c=b(something); or var c=b.doSomething(e);
[07:24:34] <jphase> so... if your b function returns an object you could have b.doSomething(); do something with that object
[07:24:44] <jphase> doSomething() is its own function
[07:25:22] <Whirl3d> cool. Thanks for the explanation.
[07:25:27] <jphase> sure thing
[07:36:34] <BillCriswell> If you're at a kiosk would you feel comfortable putting in your user name and password for facebook? We're trying to make something easily shareable but I can't think of an elegant way to make it easy to share on facebook.
[07:36:53] <Woet> BillCriswell: send it to their phones?
[07:36:57] <Woet> QR Code and the like
[07:37:29] <Woet> and allow them login on the kiosk as a fallback option
[07:37:48] <BillCriswell> If they don't have an app to read QR codes ( or know what a QR code is ) it can be kind of weird.
[07:38:15] <BillCriswell> Woet: The sending to the phone option was taken off the table for osme reason.
[07:38:32] <Woet> QR code is just one of the ways
[07:38:33] <BillCriswell> I think that would be easier, second in line would just be an email with the image attached.
[07:38:49] <BillCriswell> I think the SMS would be easiest*
[07:53:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: you around
[08:01:07] <inv3nt0r> Hi everyone... I'm having an issue with IE8 and a responsive layout. I'm using respond.js to allow media queries but it doesn't seem to be working whatsoever. Is there an alternative to respond.js that anyone could recommend?
[08:01:16] <poseid> does a link <a href="#some_product">a product</a> get found by google for SEO?
[08:07:59] <jphase> poseid: it will be crawled yes, but you should probably add a title tag to it so it can try to find relevancy to the search term used
[08:09:03] <jphase> inv3nt0r: are you adding your respond.js script after your stylesheet?
[08:15:50] <poseid> jphase: thanks, so update the title tag too? or add some attributes on the anchor tag?
[08:18:28] <jphase> poseid: yes, the title attribute is the most important for SEO, as well as the link it goes to since the string in href is checked for matching terms as well and is actually the most important
[08:18:53] <jphase> href then title in order of relevancy
[08:20:10] <inv3nt0r> jphase: No, I have put respond.js before any styles or other scripts
[08:20:29] <jphase> inv3nt0r: and it's included toward the </body> tag as well?
[08:21:37] <jphase> and I assume you're not accessing this through the file:/// protocol but on a server?
[08:22:43] <jphase> (since that won't work with IE8 locally due to the js being obtained with AJAX requests and the IE8 local security policy blows)
[08:24:44] <inv3nt0r> jphase: I figured out the problem... one of my stylesheets uses @import which is unsupported.
[08:25:05] <jphase> ahh that makes sense. good catch ;)
[08:25:06] <inv3nt0r> jphase: Helps to RTFM when using unknown scripts apparently ;)
[08:25:24] <jphase> well this particular one is finicky when it comes to graceful degradation
[08:25:43] <jphase> js that offers support for < IE8 is always good to rtm though yeah
[08:27:22] <inv3nt0r> jphase: Hear ya there... I think I'm just going to put an upgrade your browser nag on my sites from now on, supporting < IE9 is a pain. We could actually make some money if we didn't spend half of our time fixing for old versions LOL
[08:27:41] <jphase> I've done that on every non-client site that I finished haha
[08:27:51] <novochar> I have a button on the page, and I want to use a css selector to find it. I'm using protractor and I think it is using angular's jquery-lite. I want to query for a button which has the text "add me"
[08:28:11] <jphase> "Hi, you're not making the internet a better place by using this browser, here's every other choice you have:"
[08:28:21] <novochar> in protractor it would be, element(by.css(" /*your css selector*/ ")
[08:28:52] <jphase> novochar: use the :contains selector
[08:29:20] <novochar> jphase: button:contains('add me')
[08:29:22] <jphase> $(':contains(add me)') or something of the like, can't remember if you need "add me"
[08:29:24] <novochar> i guess you mean that
[08:29:26] <jphase> yeah
[08:29:33] <novochar> cool, trying
[08:30:22] <novochar> There was a webdriver error: InvalidElementStateError invalid element state: Failed to execute query: 'button:contains("add me")' is not a valid selector.
[08:30:32] <jphase> hmm
[08:30:39] <jphase> perhaps that's due to the version you have
[08:30:42] <novochar> maybe that's a protractor or angular issue
[08:30:59] <jphase> not familiar with jQlite as much. You could write your own though
[08:31:07] <jphase> grab each button, iterate through, match text
[08:32:49] <bigbugjava> blueimp jquery upload file, sends the file to node.js and amazons3, works perfect, but returns to html an erorr: SyntaxError: Unexpected token S, any ideas why?
[08:33:56] <cambazz> hello, how can i execute a function from a string
[08:34:17] <jphase> bigbugjava: if that's in your js console what filename and line number is the error on?
[08:34:24] <cambazz> i.e. i have a string like 'afterPost' and i want to execute afterPost();
[08:34:43] <jphase> cambazz: I think you'd be looking for javascripts eval function
[08:35:00] <novochar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18904903/protractorjs-testing-how-to-use-containssometext-possibly-escaping-stri
[08:35:07] <novochar> that's what i'm looking for
[08:35:09] <jphase> cambazz: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval
[08:35:31] <jphase> ahh yep, there it is heh
[08:35:42] <jphase> novochar: again you could write your own though
[08:38:20] <bigbugjava> jphase it send it to html, so there is no line or filename
[08:38:29] <bigbugjava> it gives it on every upload
[08:38:49] <bigbugjava> I just changed my node.js from res.end to res.send, it breaks the code
[08:39:02] <bigbugjava> I guess blueimp is expecting something eles
[08:39:12] <jphase> bigbugjava: not really sure about that one, that's a very specific-to-blueimp type problem. Have you googled to see if anyone else is encountering the same error?
[08:40:33] <bigbugjava> yeah no success
[08:40:52] <novochar> i'm not entirely sure i would know how to write my own, jphase
[08:40:52] <bigbugjava> I think I need to send a json array back
[08:40:55] <bigbugjava> the files[]
[08:42:25] <jphase> novochar: $('button').each(function(){ var matched = []; if($(this).text().indexOf('add me')) matched.push($(this)); })
[08:42:29] <jphase> or something like that anyhow
[08:42:57] <jphase> wrap that in a function and return matched
[08:43:08] <jphase> could whip up a quick fiddle for you if you need
[08:43:45] <novochar> if you want to, go for it
[08:45:04] <novochar> i think all you would do is do something like function findIt(el, someText) { $(el).each(function() {var matched = []; if($this).text().indxOf(someText))) matched.push($(this)); })
[08:45:10] <bigbugjava> jphase nada works
[08:45:11] <bigbugjava> wierd
[08:45:15] <novochar> that's not quite correct, bu, so I would like to see a fiddle :)
[08:45:34] <jphase> sure, one sec
[08:46:16] <jphase> oo, you could probably extend jQuery's selector engine too
[08:46:18] <jphase> that'd be fancy
[08:46:20] <jphase> let me try that
[08:46:57] <BinaryKitten> jQuery.fn.findIt = function(someText) { .....
[08:47:12] <jphase> I was thinking more like http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/extending-jquerys-selector-capabilities/
[08:47:14] <jphase> that approach
[08:47:20] <jphase> actually add in :contains to the selector :D
[08:47:42] <BinaryKitten> :contains is already there though?
[08:47:57] <jphase> BinaryKitten: not on his version of jQuery, using jquery-lite in protractor
[08:47:58] <BinaryKitten> http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[08:48:02] <BinaryKitten> ahhhh
[08:48:10] <BinaryKitten> :D
[08:48:12] <BinaryKitten> i see
[08:48:21] <BinaryKitten> grab the code and monkey patch it :)
[08:50:33] <jphase> oo looks like angular is in jsfiddle :) ftw
[08:53:48] <jphase> ooo I might need a nerdier jQuery person to help me with this :\
[08:54:33] <jphase> meh, screw it, I'll hack it together
[08:54:46] <BillCriswell> You want to get a url from a website to another device quickly: How do you accomplish this?
[08:55:05] <jphase> BillCriswell: .load ?
[08:56:00] <BillCriswell> jphase: This isn't exactly jQuery related sorry haha. Let's say I have url1.com open on machine 1 and I want to open it up on machine 2 as quickly as possible. What's my best bet?
[08:56:37] <BillCriswell> The url is simple very simple for examples sake.
[08:56:47] <jphase> BillCriswell: I guess use bit.ly or something to shorten the url?
[08:56:57] <jphase> I'm confused
[08:57:20] <BillCriswell> jphase: Haha.
[08:57:41] <BillCriswell> It's really a simple question, but I don't think there's a very quick answer to it.
[08:57:51] <BillCriswell> a simple task*
[08:59:15] <BinaryKitten> BillCriswell i have my devices linked via google account which allows me to pull up other system's tabs in chrome
[08:59:23] <BinaryKitten> either that or i email myself the url
[08:59:36] <BillCriswell> I'm on a site on machine one, I want to be able to open the same url on machine two without having to login to the browser or use any type of credentials.
[08:59:48] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: Yeah, I'm trying to avoid the logged in part.
[09:00:01] <jphase> synergy?
[09:00:04] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[09:00:06] <jphase> I use synergy here at home
[09:00:07] <jphase> lol
[09:00:16] <jphase> to share mouse and keyboard from my mac to my linux server
[09:00:22] <jphase> copies clipboard as well
[09:00:24] <BinaryKitten> url shorterner, dropbox txt file
[09:00:26] <BinaryKitten> stuff like that
[09:00:34] <BillCriswell> I have a kiosk and I want to get a url from that kiosk to a user as quickly as possible.
[09:00:35] <jphase> hastebin.com
[09:00:39] <jphase> bit.ly
[09:00:54] <jphase> QR code
[09:00:55] <jphase> hehe
[09:01:23] <BillCriswell> QR code would be perfect if more people used and understood it.
[09:03:57] <tw2113> lulz seeing commercials involving the internet, circa 1998
[09:04:28] <Osax> hi
[09:04:55] <Osax> jQuery UI demos aren't working. Seems like the jQuery library is not loaded
[09:05:07] <Osax> The issue is there since yesterday. Where to report it?
[09:05:53] <BillCriswell> Osax: I'm having no problem with them. Are you behind some goofy firewall?
[09:06:25] <Osax> not sure .. but I'm facing no issue with any other websites
[09:06:26] <BillCriswell> I wonder if you'd ever be able to input information onto another device using Google Glass. Like say you "look" at a QR code, Google Glass "remembers" it and is able to input it into a text field somewhere. That would be bad ass.
[09:06:33] <BillCriswell> Osax: Hmmmm...
[09:06:41] <Rhaoul> hey :) Does anyone know why I cannot check a checkbox "attr('checked', true)" after i used "attr('checked', false)"? http://jsfiddle.net/nB48E/2/
[09:06:59] <BillCriswell> Osax: What are the response headers?
[09:07:01] <Rhaoul> (muatally exlcusive checkboxes)
[09:07:12] <Osax> ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[09:07:15] <Osax> sorry.. one min
[09:07:22] <BillCriswell> Osax: The "Network" tab.
[09:07:51] <Osax> all 200 OK
[09:08:01] <Osax> I'm at http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[09:08:21] <BillCriswell> Osax: Try an incognito window?
[09:08:33] <BillCriswell> Wondering if you have a plugin or something fucking with you.
[09:08:50] <Osax> one sec
[09:09:00] <BillCriswell> The demo worked for me just fine. I'd also try other browsers.
[09:09:27] <Osax> same .. trying chrome
[09:14:28] <jphase> novochar: sorry for the delay, at work right now. Try something like this http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/ZC9Zf/
[09:15:34] <Velveeta> rhaoul: you want to use .prop, not .attr
[09:15:42] <jphase> you could get fancier with extending the jQuery selector object and actually pass stuff to it like :addme(something) but that hopefully will work for you as long as you have .extend and .text available
[09:16:02] <Velveeta> also, for mutually exclusive checkboxes, shouldn't you be using radio buttons instead?
[09:16:41] <Velveeta> lsax: fwiw, those demos work fine for me too
[09:16:49] <Velveeta> osax even
[09:17:34] <Rhaoul> Velveeta, customer wants boxes, not circles... :/
[09:18:41] <BillCriswell> Tell them they're a boner.
[09:18:43] <Velveeta> yeah i figured, that's just customers/designers being dumb
[09:19:12] <Velveeta> it's like, there's a reason these things were designed to function a certain way, because they're meant for different tasks
[09:19:33] <BillCriswell> Rhaoul: -webkit-appearance: checkbox; ?
[09:19:54] <Velveeta> you wouldn't say "i want a field the user can enter their name, but i want it to use a dropdown instead of text input, because they're prettier"
[09:20:01] <BillCriswell> Nevermind.
[09:20:26] <Rhaoul> :) yeah, I gave up on giving customers an UI lesson
[09:20:46] <novochar> http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.element
[09:20:47] <Rhaoul> thanks for the input on the appearance option
[09:20:49] <BillCriswell> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/279421/can-you-style-an-html-radio-button-to-look-like-a-checkbox some good answers there.
[09:20:50] <novochar> jphase: no problem
[09:21:33] <Velveeta> too bad you can't just give a radio border-radius: 0 :D
[09:23:01] <BillCriswell> Trying to decide how drunk I should get tonight.
[09:23:48] <jphase> BillCriswell:[-------------------------- THIS DRUNK ------------------------]
[09:23:57] <jphase> :D
[09:24:03] <BillCriswell> I can measure that.
[09:24:14] <Velveeta> 1 whole drunk
[09:24:20] <jphase> lol
[09:24:22] <JapieDay> i'm on my first beer for today
[09:24:26] <Velveeta> drunkpacity: 1;
[09:24:37] <jphase> maybe 1.2rem of drunkeness
[09:24:44] <Velveeta> nice
[09:25:05] <jphase> wow, our nerd just fell out
[09:25:55] <BillCriswell> % works oddly well here, guys.
[09:26:18] <BillCriswell> drunk: 90%
[09:26:39] <Velveeta> you still have too much blood in your alcohol system
[09:27:28] <BillCriswell> Haha
[09:27:43] <Rhaoul> funny - i found this example on the web: http://jsfiddle.net/PRpQC/2/ It works with jquery 1.8.3 but it does not with jquery 1.10.2 - does anyone know where the problem is?
[09:30:02] <Velveeta> rhaoul: i already answered your question, you should be using .prop('checked'), not .attr
[09:31:08] <Osax> BillCriswell, I justed tested with a VPN. Same issue
[09:31:24] <Rhaoul> Velveeta, my bad! thank you for reminding me
[09:31:27] <Velveeta> :)
[09:32:42] <BillCriswell> Osax: And you're sure jQuery came back 200?
[09:35:56] <Osax> BillCriswell, yes
[09:37:27] <Rhaoul> still no luck with prop + 1.10.2 (http://jsfiddle.net/PRpQC/51/). Will try radios now ;)
[09:37:59] <BillCriswell> Osax: Are the contents of it what you expect?
[09:38:12] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: This demo working for you? http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[09:38:12] <systemfault> Rhaoul: Don't compare the return of .prop to a string..
[09:38:24] <Velveeta> billcriswell: yep, works fine for me
[09:38:44] <Osax> BillCriswell, I cleared the cache and reconnected the VPN .. now it works
[09:38:47] <BillCriswell> It's not for Osax, not sure why. $ is undefined for him.
[09:38:50] <Velveeta> rhaoul: .prop('checked') takes true/false values
[09:38:52] <BillCriswell> Osax: Ah, weird.
[09:38:58] <Osax> I'll disconnect and try again
[09:39:26] <Rhaoul> thanks guys, it's working! @ Velveeta + systemfault
[09:39:32] <Osax> maybe a stupid ISP cache
[09:39:42] <Velveeta> rhaoul: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/PRpQC/53/
[09:40:07] <Osax> BillCriswell, yes .. it is .. two damn ISPs here in Kuwait have stupid cache
[09:40:07] <Osax> CTRL+F5 and clear  history fixed it :)
[09:40:09] <BillCriswell> Osax: Yeah. I know for a while I had some weird DNS settings that brough reddit.com to something totally weird but www.reddit.com worked fine.
[09:40:11] <Osax> sorry .. thanks ;)
[09:40:18] <BillCriswell> Osax: No problem!
[09:40:38] <Velveeta> hey bill, where's that irc log kept at again?
[09:40:52] <JapieDay> guys i've been trying to get my TEST button in top of this page going: http://pitchupmedia.nl/index.php its supposed to go animated scroll to my div id "overons" but it doesn't scroll but goes straight to that div, i can't seem to figure out what is wrong. The js is @ http://pitchupmedia.nl/js/parallax.js
[09:41:00] <Velveeta> i logged off last night before someone could answer something i asked about, i wanna see if there was any other talk on it after i left
[09:41:27] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[09:41:43] <BillCriswell> You should know I called you a butt hole.
[09:42:13] <Velveeta> i wouldn't have believed these logs were legitimate if that had been missing
[09:42:39] <Velveeta> nope, nobody said anything else
[09:43:13] <Velveeta> billcriswell: check the logs for 12/30 and do a search for this: this seem a bit unreliable
[09:43:58] <Velveeta> it's at 21:31 system time
[09:44:40] <JapieDay> aibo helped me a bit
[09:44:50] <JapieDay> but it didn't turn out how i wanted it
[09:44:56] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: What am I looking at exaclty?
[09:45:25] <Velveeta> some guy said $(function () { was unreliable because it fired before the dom was ready sometimes
[09:45:35] <systemfault> ...
[09:45:41] <systemfault> it's an _alias_ afaik
[09:45:45] <Velveeta> some other guy said yeah, if you use it before the dom is ready, it'll fire on only the portion of the dom that's loaded
[09:45:52] <Velveeta> systemfault: exactly
[09:45:53] <BillCriswell> Oh haha
[09:46:06] <Velveeta> i was like "what's all this about document.ready firing when the dom isn't ready?
[09:46:12] <Velveeta> but then nobody ever responded again
[09:46:54] <Velveeta> here we go, hooray hyperlinks: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20131230.log.html#t21:31:24
[09:47:23] <Velveeta> my guess is that they had some dynamic content that wasn't loaded when it fired, and had the wrong expectations
[09:47:41] <Velveeta> but i was trying to get clarity, to make sure there wasn't some legitimate buggy state
[09:47:58] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I was thinking they did $(function(){ ... }); in like the middle of a table or something.
[09:48:23] <Velveeta> well even so (provided it was in a script tag) it should wait for document ready
[09:48:45] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure I understand it well enough haha
[09:49:01] <Velveeta> $(function() {} is just an alias to $(document).ready
[09:49:13] <Velveeta> they're functional equivalents, one is just shorthand
[09:49:19] <Velveeta> like $ === jQuery
[09:49:28] <BillCriswell> Yeah, but I'm not sure if document is always the whole document or just the document up to that point.
[09:49:59] <Velveeta> it's when the DOMContentLoaded event is fired by the browser, or a couple of other checks for legacy browsers
[09:50:13] <Velveeta> whenever the full dom tree is loaded and available for parsing
[09:50:25] <Velveeta> but it doesn't count dynamic content
[09:50:50] <Velveeta> so if you load a shell of a page and then ajax-load the content, it fires document ready when the shell is loaded, not the ajax request completed
[09:51:31] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure I understand document enough :(
[09:51:59] <Velveeta> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document :D
[09:52:21] <BillCriswell> Does it wait for everything inside <body> to load, <html>?
[09:52:38] <systemfault> BillCriswell: In that specific case, document ready means... that it parsed the original HTML into nodes.
[09:52:59] <Velveeta> whenever the full document, all of the markup, html -> /html, is loaded and available for traversal
[09:53:19] <JapieDay> guys i've been trying to get my TEST button in top of this page going: http://pitchupmedia.nl/index.php its supposed to go animated scroll to my div id "overons" but it doesn't scroll but goes straight to that div, i can't seem to figure out what is wrong. The js is @ http://pitchupmedia.nl/js/parallax.js
[09:54:26] <Velveeta> japieday: for one thing, you know that button has a title of "class=homenav" right?
[09:54:36] <Velveeta> looks like you might have an attribute value not closed properly
[09:55:27] <Velveeta> and that's probably what your problem is, since your parallax.js file is trying to grab a.homenav, which in the case of the test button, isn't a valid selector
[09:59:51] <BillCriswell> http://i.imgur.com/mpPf2W8.jpg I love my phone's wallpaper.
[10:00:16] <Velveeta> lol
[10:00:54] <systemfault> Oh my lulz :/
[10:01:01] <systemfault> What a creepy wallpaper.
[10:01:11] <Velveeta> creepy, yet glamorous
[10:01:15] <BillCriswell> My girlfriend saw it and was like "Why?"
[10:03:51] <BillCriswell> I'm out of here. Later!
[10:03:58] <BillCriswell> Happy New Year Everyone!
[10:04:02] <Uhkis> happy new year
[10:04:08] <Uhkis> almost had time to type :D
[10:04:40] <Velveeta> merry new year! hahahahaa! beef jerky time..
[10:43:11] <Velveeta> japieday: did you ever get your problem sorted out?
[10:45:56] <donatj> Does anyone know if there's a way to do jQuery.add equiv in place on the existing object rather than spining up a new one.  I need to not break existing references
[10:48:01] <donatj> currently I have something like noted_checkboxes = noted_checkboxes.add(checkbox);
[10:48:47] <donatj> but its breaking code in previously attached events, as its a new object, and they're pointing at a reference to the old object
[10:50:27] <Velveeta> the only way to do that with .add would be to overwrite .add and manually add the new nodes into the existing list without going through pushstack
[10:50:48] <donatj> So there's no way to push into the stack by hand?
[10:51:10] <Velveeta> but if you do that, you're still going to have inconsistencies, because your event listeners are going to be bound to the original nodes that made up that collection, not the new ones that were added
[10:51:31] <Velveeta> that's what i'm saying, you'll have to push those items into the collection manually
[10:51:45] <Velveeta> without going through the pushstack method, which returns a new scope level
[10:52:17] <Velveeta> but you'd be better off refactoring your code to do this properly, than hacking the way the add method works
[10:52:21] <donatj> If I just switched to a base js array, are they passed by reference?
[10:53:12] <Velveeta> the way event listeners are bound is through the $.cache and add/attachEventListener native functions, they're not bound to the collection object itself, but rather to the actual html elements
[10:53:31] <Velveeta> so if you push more elements into that collection, they don't automatically inherit event listeners
[10:55:22] <donatj> the only reason I was using a jQuery object as my collection rather than a [] array is because I thought I could pass it by reference.  it would appear I can simply use a native array instead
[10:56:16] <Velveeta> ok, but that doesn't mean that event listeners are gonna auto-bind themselves to new elements in the collection
[10:56:42] <Velveeta> they're bound to elements in the dom, not variable instances of those element collections, whether they're objects or arrays
[10:57:35] <Velveeta> and now it's time for me to afk for a while
[10:57:37] <donatj> the problem was I have an event on an element not in this collection that foreach's over my collection changing their value. I was changing that collection but it was still foreaching over the original collection
[10:57:51] <donatj> my event will be fine because my native array is by reference
[10:58:25] <Velveeta> annnnnd he's gone
[10:58:37] <Velveeta> before i could say "you do know objects are passed by reference also, right?"
[10:58:49] <Velveeta> oh well
[11:25:19] <jdsharp> I have a submit button that's generated from a CMS, is there a way I can change it's data-theme by wrapping it in another element? (Rather than changing it with JavaScript)
[11:29:07] <zumba_addict> hey folks, how do you test IE if you are on a mac? I don't have any windows vmware image
[11:29:40] <jphase> zumba_addict: browserstack.com
[11:29:48] <zumba_addict> looking
[11:30:09] <jphase> you can use PlayOnMac as well but any emulation isn't the real thing
[11:30:16] <jphase> sometimes you need IE's "debugging" tools
[11:30:29] <zumba_addict> got it
[11:31:26] <snover> zumba_addict: http://modern.ie
[11:31:38] <zumba_addict> ok
[11:31:55] <zumba_addict> snover, I tried but when there is none for MAC
[11:32:31] <snover> youâ€™re blind
[11:32:32] <zumba_addict> I was wrong
[11:32:39] <zumba_addict> I picked Windows rather than MAC
[11:32:40] <zumba_addict> :)
[11:33:16] <zumba_addict> curling it now :)
[11:33:17] <zumba_addict> thanks
[11:38:14] <troop> hello, im trying some tutorial...
[11:38:25] <troop> http://pastebin.ca/2520759 this script does nothing?
[11:38:27] <troop> whts problem?
[11:41:34] <jedimind> troop:  your form has no action, it wont submit afaik
[11:41:48] <cronin> I have a form where the user can add fields dynamically via jQuery. If they click submit, and there's a server-side validation error, they're redirected back to the form. However, all the DOM-inserted fields are gone. What's the best approach to make these persist even with a server-side validation error?
[11:41:57] <troop> jedimind, ajax method has?
[11:42:13] <jedimind> troop:  it doesnt matter if youre using the .submit() event
[11:42:15] <jedimind> since it doesnt get triggered
[11:42:26] <jedimind> anyway thats my guess, you could setup a live testcase
[11:42:33] <jedimind> jsfiddle.net
[11:42:43] <troop> actually, i'm trying this tutorial http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/submitting-ajax-forms-the-angularjs-way
[11:42:49] <xerxes> oh shi*
[11:43:09] <xerxes> my jQuery is saying i am using IE 8 with Chrome :D
[11:43:15] <jedimind> troop: youre following an angularjs tutorial to submit a form via jquery?
[11:43:43] <troop> if you read some you will see, first script is jquery
[11:43:44] <jedimind> oh i see its jquery
[11:43:46] <jedimind> but named angular
[11:43:52] <troop> it is versus
[11:43:58] <troop> but im on the jquery side now
[11:44:00] <troop> :)
[11:44:01] <xerxes> idk wtf is that but it can't be IE
[11:44:04] <troop> im learning both..
[11:44:09] <jedimind> setup a test case troop
[11:44:17] <troop> test case?
[11:44:28] <jedimind> yeah instead of just pasting your code
[11:44:30] <jedimind> jsfiddle.net
[11:44:35] <jedimind> go there and replicate your problem
[11:44:41] <troop> hmm ok
[11:56:50] <MrFox> hi :)
[11:57:06] <MrFox> any of you fellas already in 2014?
[12:03:13] <jphase> not me, 3:03pm here
[12:27:05] <lemd> I get the right output for the width of each image, but how should I add them together? http://pastebin.com/NELVyfsg
[12:27:43] <lemd> I tried a += but it's giving me the wrong total
[13:20:07] <jphase> lemd: you should use .width() instead
[13:20:30] <jphase> either that or parseInt() around that
[13:20:47] <tieTYT2> why does this behave badly (yet differently) in firefox and chrome, and what's a better way to accomplish the same thing?  I'm trying to make it so that space clicks on the element in focus: http://jsfiddle.net/cPrSZ/
[13:21:46] <jphase> tieTYT2: isn't that a native browser function in almost every browser already?
[13:22:06] <jphase> oh, you only want space, got it
[13:22:18] <zeroquake> hey , i am inserting an iFrame and in that , i am inserting some html in body tag - using .contents().find(body) and then appending to it. works fine in Chrome but in IE9  nothing is inserted into body tag -- there is no <body> either jus </body>
[13:23:52] <tieTYT2> jphase: it is, sorta.  But I'm making a game.  On my splash screen, I don't have a form input.  So I'm clicking a div.  In FF, this clicks the splash screen and then in FF it clicks the next dialog's button too (all in one click).  Chrome acts differently but correctly
[13:23:53] <snover> zeroquake: stop trying to meddle in frames.
[13:25:02] <zeroquake> i have set of files i cant edit that have to be displayed in ppart of a page
[13:25:14] <zeroquake> do u recommend any better of displaying them
[13:32:56] <jphase> tieTYT2: the click event is firing for me in Chrome
[13:45:55] <RonWhoCares> In this syntax how to give the variable "open_for_maintenance" the value of "flagged_for_review" (not a variable received from a form, but literally "flagged_for_review"    $.post("/functions/the_verse_of_the_day_blog_review/refresh_blog_review_menu.php",{open_for_maintenance:flagged_for_review},function(data) { $("#blog_review_menu_container").html(data);});
[13:46:52] <tieTYT2> jphase: check this out, this is a much better example of my issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20863515/in-firefox-changing-the-focus-in-a-keydown-event-handler-automatically-clicks-w
[13:49:35] <jphase> tieTYT2: can't you just bind your keydown event to the document instead and dispatch your keyboard operations from there?
[13:49:46] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/cPrSZ/3/
[13:52:51] <tieTYT2> jphase: you built on top of the old example, not the new one from the link.  That doesn't fix the issue on the new example
[13:53:16] <tieTYT2> and that code you gave me didn't fix anything either
[13:54:27] <jphase> hmm, works good for me
[13:54:35] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/cPrSZ/4/
[13:54:47] <jphase> that's with the new example, I click inside the body where the button is, hit space, it focuses and clicks
[13:55:29] <tieTYT2> jphase: that's the behavior i'm trying to prevent
[13:56:06] <jphase> I'm a bit confused, it looks like it's doing what it's coded to do. What do you want to happen when space is pressed?
[13:56:19] <troop> http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/submitting-ajax-forms-the-angularjs-way have anyonve tried this tutorial before ( i mean jquery part ) because form doesnt work for me
[13:56:40] <tieTYT2> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/cPrSZ/2/
[13:56:47] <tieTYT2> click on the paragraph then press space
[13:57:12] <jphase> yeah, it focuses on the button like you told it to
[13:57:19] <tieTYT2> it also clicks it right?
[13:57:26] <tieTYT2> brings up a dialog saying the button is clicked?
[13:57:28] <jphase> well you didn't tell it to click in this one
[13:57:36] <jphase> it doesn't click for me
[13:57:42] <tieTYT2> are you trying in firefox?
[13:57:45] <jphase> no
[13:57:48] <jphase> Chrome latest
[13:57:48] <tieTYT2> that's key
[13:57:50] <jphase> k
[13:57:56] <tieTYT2> this is specifically something that occurs in firefox
[13:58:47] <Asmooh> anyone still uses firefox in 2013?
[14:01:15] <jphase> tieTYT2: you might want to change your event then
[14:01:20] <jphase> change to keyup
[14:01:59] <jphase> also, your stopProp() function is redundant, replace that with return false; and it does the same thing
[14:04:49] <snover> that is not true.
[14:05:25] <snover> oh, wait, yes it is. thought you were shorthanding stopPropagation.
[14:11:25] <troop> http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/submitting-ajax-forms-the-angularjs-way have anyonve tried this tutorial before ( i mean jquery part ) because form doesnt work for me
[14:15:08] * troop happy new years
[14:15:50] <mdev> any clever 1 line way to get 1 or 0 for whether a checkbox is checked
[14:15:53] <mdev> with jquery?
[14:15:59] <mdev> var ischecked =
[14:16:55] <jphase> mdev: if($('input.mycheck').is(':checked')) doStuff();
[14:16:55] <mbytes> hello
[14:17:09] <Asmooh> C00019C6F
[14:18:03] <mbytes> is there any case where one would not want to stringify the data parameter in an ajax request?
[14:19:18] <mdev> jphase yeah I found a simple function that covnerts to integer so just doing toInt($('#fb_on').attr('checked'));
[14:19:27] <mbytes> or what sort of scenarios would someone pass processData = false to $.ajax?
[14:23:54] <mbytes> anyone familiar with a situation where you specifically want to set processData = false for a DELETE request?
[14:24:06] <mbytes> to $.ajax that is
[14:34:50] <mdev> ahh they removed .live that's cool
[14:34:56] <mdev> probably breaks my entire project that's cool
[14:34:58] <mdev> thanks jquery
[14:35:01] <Asmooh> lol
[14:44:46] <joelito119> ?
[14:44:57] <mdev> ?

[14:51:49] <micz123> hi all
[14:53:08] <oste> hello - I am trying to get a script similar to this to act as an ajax queue
[14:53:10] <oste> https://gist.github.com/oste/8203050
[14:53:25] <micz123> i plan to get json object from data- attribute in html, but i found out that it captured as a string... i tried to convert it with $.parseJSON or jQuery.parseJSON but no luck
[14:53:55] <oste> the code would run in a loop and I need to only call the data.submit when the previous called method ends
[14:54:00] <micz123> how do we convert it?
[14:55:05] <Asmooh> with a pen and glue? :)
[14:55:53] <oste> i am basically looking for this https://github.com/gnarf/jquery-ajaxQueue
[14:55:55] <oste> simplified i think
[14:56:20] <Asmooh> i never have ajax issues dont know where people get them from all the time
[14:56:30] <Asmooh> if you get json data you can append it to a div if you want to
[15:18:01] <ineedhelp> Is this a jquery dev chat room?
[15:18:14] <ineedhelp> I'm having a problem I can't figure out..
[15:19:43] <coldhead> let's hear it, ineedhelp
[15:19:47] <ineedhelp> I'm building a demo site for a band at http://theboardwalkfayetteville.com/fullhouse/.
[15:20:10] <ineedhelp> I used ceebox for my photo gallery.
[15:20:36] <ineedhelp> It works as long as I don't have <script type="text/javascript" src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.5.1/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js"></script> called in, which I'm using for div borders.
[15:20:54] <ineedhelp> They both work independently, but no together.
[15:21:00] <coldhead> so there is a conflict
[15:21:09] <ineedhelp> They shouldn't interfere, but do.
[15:21:20] <coldhead> that is annoying
[15:22:36] <coldhead> are you using jQuery on this site?
[15:22:45] <ineedhelp> Yeah. Yes, sir.
[15:22:53] <coldhead> oh right, on the photos page
[15:25:22] <ineedhelp> Yeah, that's pretty much the only part of the site I use it for.. I use it for an mp3 player on the audio site, too.
[15:25:34] <ineedhelp> But just the photos page is having issues.
[15:26:15] <coldhead> ineedhelp: i can't see what the issue might be
[15:26:29] <coldhead> but have you tried switching the order you load things?
[15:26:47] <coldhead> as in move the ceebox code ABOVE the border code?
[15:26:51] <ineedhelp> no. could that make a difference?
[15:27:01] <ineedhelp> is there a bettter way to do borders like this?
[15:27:02] <coldhead> it might! very easy to test :)
[15:27:02] <ineedhelp> http://www.punteney.com/writes/custom-image-frames-javascript-also-works-divs/
[15:27:08] <ineedhelp> I'll try.
[15:42:56] <grafi> happy new something all you irc peoples
[15:52:00] <coldhead> what have we become
[15:53:11] <snover> hapy becoming coldhead
[15:56:10] <coldhead> thanks snover, you too
[16:05:56] <coldhead> how dare freenode wish me a happy new year
[16:11:09] <grafi> those assholes ^^
[16:42:19] <Johan> hello
[16:43:59] <Guest13771> Test?
[16:46:49] <wroathe> I've packaged a simple jar to test out Log4j and I've placed both the log4j api and core jars next to it in the same directory and declared them as dependencies in my MANIFEST.MF. Inside of public static void main(...) I have logger.info("Hello, World!"); and when I run the jar with java -jar I don't get any output...
[16:46:59] <wroathe> The documentation says the default appender is to STDOUT
[16:47:17] <Guest13771> what you try to build?
[16:47:18] <wroathe> I don't get runtime errors either... it just returns to the next line
[16:47:37] <wroathe> Just playing around with it... I'm new to Java
[16:47:45] <coldhead> this is #jQuery, not #javaQuery
[16:47:50] <wroathe> Oh snap
[16:47:51] <wroathe> lol
[16:47:56] <wroathe> Sorry guys
[16:47:57] <wroathe> Fail
[16:49:02] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[18:07:43] <fattest> is it possible that if i scroll down, past "home" or "contact" (example), li class will be active for the fixed bottom navbar? http://jsfiddle.net/dm4Nn/6/
[18:15:34] <javalover> ummm
[18:15:38] <javalover> how does js-fiddle make money?
[18:20:39] <systemfault> Perhaps it doesn't. :/
[18:43:41] <KeyboardNotFound> Happy New Year to everyone :)
[19:17:54] <fattest> why does my scrollspy always stay in the last link http://jsfiddle.net/dm4Nn/
[20:02:49] <lethjakman> so I have one selector that would look like this $('*[class^="part-"]') but I have a is-visible class that I'd like to additionally select upon and find out what number that is within the array that's returned
[20:02:51] <lethjakman> is there a good way to do this?
[20:06:16] <doug65536> lethjakman: $('*[class^="part-"].is-visible') ?
[20:07:18] <doug65536> lethjakman: "what number?" do you mean how many things matched? use .length: $('*[class^="part-"].is-visible').length
[20:08:39] <doug65536> lethjakman: or do you mean part-###... is the class name and you want to extract the ###
[20:09:15] <doug65536> lethjakman: if so, you're doing it wrong. don't cram data into the class name, use data attributes
[20:11:35] <lethjakman> I have many with part- on it and I'd like to check what number the one with the additional class of is-visible is
[20:44:28] <doug65536> lethjakman: this may help http://jsfiddle.net/yBvBs/
[20:44:38] <doug65536> the result is 0-based
[21:13:01] <oste> how do you chain ajax requests with deferred and promises?
[21:13:53] <oste> if you have a loop that calls an ajax request each time, how do you make sure the previous request fires before the following
[21:15:31] <oste> happy new year by the way to those on the east coast :)
[21:15:55] <oste> probably not the best time to be talking query - just getting into the deferred concept - kinda lost
[23:08:40] <elnaz> hi who can speak persian with me?
[23:09:26] <elnaz> I have a question
