[00:14:04] <agi_> coldhead are you there?
[00:15:43] <coldhead> not really
[00:17:17] <Sami89> when we use bind and when click event?
[00:18:12] <coldhead> they are the same, Sami89
[00:18:19] <coldhead> you can use whichever you prefer
[00:18:47] <coldhead> bind is nice because you can bind multiple things: $('foo').bind('click mouseover keypress', ...)
[00:18:52] <coldhead> sometimes you want that
[00:19:01] <Sami89> then there are bind,on,delegate #coldhead
[00:22:37] <javalover> ok i have a serious problem
[00:22:56] <coldhead> Sami89: on() is the "proper" way to do it
[00:22:58] <javalover> if i load any version of jquery beyond 1.7 it works fine, anything less and it won't work... BUT
[00:23:07] <coldhead> bind() etc are from older versions of jQuery
[00:23:09] <javalover> explorer is giving me an error for all versions 1.7 & up
[00:23:09] <coldhead> but they will work also
[00:23:29] <coldhead> javalover: maybe a doctype issue?
[00:23:38] <Sami89> thanks coldhead
[00:23:40] <javalover> could be but how would I fix that?
[00:23:40] <coldhead> jQuery definitely does work in recent IE
[00:23:42] <coldhead> they test that
[00:23:50] <javalover> i'm talking for explorer 8
[00:23:54] <coldhead> javalover: link #jQuery to a reduced test case
[00:23:56] <javalover> for all users who are on windows xp still
[00:24:12] <coldhead> even IE6 is still supported by jQuery
[00:24:19] <javalover> but which versions?
[00:24:25] <javalover> all?
[00:24:34] <crab> only back to IE6
[00:24:47] <javalover> Could not complete the operation due to error 80020101.
[00:24:57] <javalover> is the error it gives me for all jquerys 1.7 & up
[00:25:04] <javalover> anything less & I don't get that error
[00:25:16] <javalover> although it doesn't load my content if i go less than 1.7 ....so could still be my content that is the issue
[00:25:56] <coldhead> i've never seen that error
[00:26:05] <javalover> great
[00:26:20] <coldhead> http://docs.jquery.com/Browser_Compatibility
[00:27:05] <smithbh> javalover: are you making any ajax requests
[00:27:22] <javalover> yes
[00:27:23] <javalover> its' all based on ajax
[00:27:53] <javalover> and i use .load which I heard is also ajax in the background
[00:28:01] <coldhead> http://mattwhite.me/blog/2010/4/21/tracking-down-error-80020101-in-internet-exploder.html
[00:28:15] <coldhead> apparently it might be invalid JSON
[00:28:27] <coldhead> i would try running the code through jshint
[00:28:31] <coldhead> and getting a coffee
[00:28:36] <javalover> i do use json....but in php & then I return it
[00:28:38] <coldhead> putting on some Tortoise
[00:29:11] <smithbh> what does your json look like
[00:29:28] <javalover> i'm using facebook api
[00:29:44] <javalover> and I just do json_encode  or json_decode on the facebook request
[00:29:56] <javalover> none of the json ever touches javascript/jquery
[00:30:26] <smithbh> what does your request look like
[00:31:08] <javalover> $fbook = curl("https://graph.facebook.com/"); 	  $json3 = json_decode($fbook);
[00:31:20] <javalover> i shortened the link btw...
[00:33:41] <javalover> hmmmm
[00:33:47] <javalover> so i'm reading over what this guy wrote....
[00:33:55] <javalover> my ajax is requesting php....
[00:34:09] <javalover> but I have this ajaxRequest.setRequestHeader("Content-type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded");
[00:34:31] <javalover> so....should I change that to like a more php suitable form?
[00:43:39] <javalover> ok so I just ran the debugger
[00:43:47] <javalover> and I think my error is actually associated with a different error
[00:44:15] <javalover> i'm running a forEach function & for some reason that is having a problem so imma try to fix that and maybe it fixes everything
[00:47:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone experience with uploadify?
[00:47:48] <javalover> oh wow so I just read it online, explorer does not support for each
[00:47:52] <javalover> AMAZING!!!
[00:48:04] <javalover> thx microshaft!!!
[00:51:56] <Cork> javalover: that's why theres a $.each function
[00:52:05] <VX> via ajax is there a way to get the server to send data to the client, instead of requesting it via the client ?
[00:52:14] <Cork> javalover: $.each(arr, function() {});
[00:52:29] <Cork> VX: no, ajax is always requests
[00:52:46] <Cork> VX: actually all connections has to always be established by the client
[00:53:04] <Cork> VX: you would have to look into comet, longpull or similar
[00:53:17] <VX> ok
[00:53:18] <NodeX> socket.io is a good library for it
[00:53:21] <Cork> VX: alternatively check websocket (not supported in ie though)
[00:53:32] <NodeX> but your webserver will need to support websockets
[00:54:13] <VX> guess its not gonna work, i was looking for a simple implementation
[00:54:27] <Cork> VX: just make a timer pull
[00:54:27] <javalover> thx cork
[00:54:33] <javalover> was busy getting food ty so much
[00:54:35] <Cork> VX: that's quite simple
[00:54:58] <VX> Cork well id be missing stuff with that which is why i wanted to get the server to send back
[00:55:19] <Cork> VX: that depends on how you implement it
[00:55:42] <Cork> VX: the server would have to keep a queue, and the client would have to request from a checkpoint
[00:55:45] <VX> php > updating a single line in a file with current status, and ajax reading that file to get the progress
[00:56:06] <Cork> VX: but you would have to do that anyway, cause if the client loses connection you would want to resume where you where
[00:56:48] <VX> well its doing a back end task, so no resumption
[00:57:05] <VX> it will do it and finish, so im trying to get where the steps are and whave has been done
[00:57:58] <javalover> omgomogmomgomg
[00:57:59] <javalover> OMG
[00:58:02] <javalover> FIXED!
[00:58:21] <VX> javalover you sound fixated
[00:58:28] <Cork> :D
[00:59:05] <javalover> so this is what i discovered
[00:59:20] <javalover> when downgrading the jquery i eliminated the .load function from the library hence never causing the error
[00:59:34] <javalover> the true error was in the loop itself, which you can't call forEach in explorer
[00:59:40] <javalover> so now i'm fixed for good YES!
[00:59:51] <VX> nuted ?
[01:00:03] <javalover> lol pretty much
[01:01:17] <agi_> how can i validate radio buttons?
[01:01:39] <VX> first of all, do you have a radio ?
[01:02:03] <VX> they generally have dials though
[01:04:57] <dns-away> #freenode
[01:05:07] <VX> dns-away yes speaking
[01:05:28] <dns-away> ignoring /join ?
[01:06:08] <Cork> you missed it
[01:07:41] <calistor> I'm looking for a way to contextually connect elements with eachother: Lets say i have a list with elements, and coresponding image tiles... now i'd like to trigger an event for both the list item and the corresponding image tile if i e.g. hover one of them. What's the best practice?
[01:08:06] <Cork> calistor: are they positioned in the same order?
[01:08:21] <calistor> Cork: no
[01:08:37] <Cork> the you would have to store it, and use id's
[01:08:46] <calistor> I was thinking about an extra html attribute with somekind of id
[01:09:15] <Cork> <img data-target="id2"> $('#' + $('img').first().data('target'))
[01:10:00] <Cork> calistor: be sure to use the data- prefix so you don't get name collisions
[01:10:22] <calistor> Cork: yeah, i thought about some like this, too. Thanks for the prefix hint.
[01:11:54] <Cork> calistor: if you could have them in the same order in the dom, it could be handled nicer
[01:12:13] <emericBZH> Hello
[01:12:23] <calistor> Cork: hmm how would you do it then?
[01:13:10] <Cork> if this is one end $('.other-end').eq($(this).index())
[01:13:28] <emericBZH> I need help please, I would like to know how to do a jQuery module that provides methods for setting CSS border properties
[01:13:55] <calistor> Cork: interesting, thanks.
[01:13:56] <xec_> like .css does?
[01:14:01] <Cork> :D
[01:14:08] <Cork> calistor: np
[01:14:44] <xec_> emericBZH: is this just a practice project for yoursef to learn jquery?
[01:15:00] <emericBZH> yes
[01:15:06] <xec_> i see
[01:15:26] <emericBZH> I would like to know for exemple how to do that : obj.border({width: '2px', color: 'red', radius: '1px'});
[01:15:56] <Cork> .css({ 'color: 'red',  })
[01:15:57] <xec_> emericBZH: you know the basics about plugins? seen this? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[01:15:58] <Cork> opps
[01:16:56] <xec_> emericBZH: do you know how to make a plain old js function that would accept that parameter?
[01:17:07] <emericBZH> xec_> I have some basis but I dont know how to test the argument whether if there is no argument, if it null ...
[01:17:41] <emericBZH> I am using jQuery.fn.extend
[01:18:10] <emericBZH> this is my first problem in fact
[01:19:23] <xec_> jQuery.fn.extend? why not jQuery.extend
[01:20:10] <emericBZH> and my second problem is I dont know exactly what is that : {width: '2px', color: 'red', radius: '1px'} ? I dont know what a "{" means
[01:20:23] <xec_> it's an object literal
[01:21:09] <xec_> let's say you pass that to a: function border(myObj) { /* here i have access to myObj.width */ }
[01:21:55] <emericBZH> I see ok
[01:22:02] <xec_> works the same way in a plugin, $.fn.border = function (myObj) { ... }
[01:22:50] <emericBZH> what is the dif between jQuery.fn.extend and jQuery.extend ?
[01:23:13] <xec_> i've never seen anyone mention jQuery.fn.extend before tbh
[01:23:26] <xec_> but it looks like it's the same
[01:23:33] <impi> hey guys,
[01:23:44] <Cork> xec: no its not
[01:23:55] <impi> im looking for a scrollbar plugin that shows a custom scrollbar when you hover over an element with overflow: auto
[01:24:09] <Cork> xec: $.fn.extend will extend the $.fn object
[01:24:13] <Cork> its overloaded
[01:24:16] <impi> im using this one : https://github.com/nathggns/Scrollbars/#scrollbarautohide but it's a bit finniky on the show/hide scrollbar
[01:24:22] <ItsJustMe> Hey guys (: Do someone know frameWarp?
[01:24:25] <xec_> ?eval jQuery.fn.extend === jQuery.extend
[01:24:27] <bot-t> xec_: true
[01:24:51] <Cork> xec: $.fn.extend is the same as $.extend($.fn,
[01:25:00] <xec_> oh i see
[01:25:42] <Cork> so you can do $.fn.extend({ my_plugin: function() {} })
[01:25:49] <xec_> in order to create multiple methods at the same time i guess
[01:25:55] <Cork> yes
[01:25:58] <xec_> right
[01:26:26] <Cork> its the recommended way to extend fn
[01:26:34] <sh0ne> how can I change (toggle between two values) all attribute values of a button tag when I click it?
[01:26:57] <Cork> ?.toggle @ sh0ne
[01:26:58] <bot-t> sh0ne, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[01:27:25] <ItsJustMe> frameWarp opens an inline popup .. How can I return a value on frameWarp.hide()? If it gets closed I need to react and reload the page, the one which opened frameWarp. An idea how to do that?
[01:27:40] <Cork> sh0ne: if that's not enough you have to check what the attr is, and set the alternative
[01:27:43] <emericBZH> xec_> Would you know please when I have extend how to test the $argument ? how to know if it is a string, an object, null or empty ?
[01:28:32] <Cork> ItsJustMe: you can't really, why don't you just check if its display: none; or not?
[01:29:15] <sh0ne> Cork: I tried to put all attribute values like " <?=(cond)?true:false> " but nothing happens
[01:29:34] <Cork> sh0ne: that looks like it would be server side code
[01:29:47] <Cork> sh0ne: that would just work when the page is generated server side
[01:29:55] <Cork> you need to do the check in js
[01:29:56] <ItsJustMe> Cork: Because I open several "popups" and don't know how to get then which one were opened / closed ..
[01:30:02] <xec_> emericBZH: that doesn't really have anything to do with jQuery, but usually you don't need to test. if you're making a "border" plugin, you're just making a shorthand for .css() so you can just pass the values on
[01:30:26] <sh0ne> Cork: I think you're right
[01:30:42] <Cork> ItsJustMe: you should filter that so you're selector just contains the elements you want to show
[01:31:06] <xec_> emericBZH: if you're passing in options, it's common to use a set of default options and just override the ones that are passed in using $.extend() (which is what i thought you meant earlier)
[01:31:10] <Cork> ItsJustMe: try something like .filter(':visible')
[01:31:23] <Cork> uh. actually no
[01:31:29] <Cork> you want .not(':visible')
[01:31:39] <ItsJustMe> :D
[01:31:55] <ItsJustMe> I don't know if I want .. But thanks, I'll try ^^
[01:32:06] <xec_> emericBZH: but you should really go through the authoring introduction page
[01:32:23] <Cork> ItsJustMe: that way you can filter out the dialogs that isn't visible when the link is clicked, and just have them in a variable
[01:32:34] <Cork> ItsJustMe: then you have a set with elements it belongs to
[01:35:39] <emericBZH> _xec > I am reading it but sorry it doesnt help for my problem
[01:37:45] <xec_> emericBZH: it's a good read anyway ;) if you make a fiddle with what you have so far (and outlines what your problem is) i'll be back in a couple minutes.
[01:42:19] <emericBZH> humm ok
[01:42:26] <emericBZH> I have think about it
[01:42:54] <emericBZH> in fact yeah, to deal with the case if there is or not argument I can overidden
[01:43:36] <Cork> emericBZH: you're taking an object for your options right?
[01:44:21] <Cork> why not just check if the object has the member you want to change, and if it's not there just leave it as it is
[01:44:35] <Cork> and if its set to say null you remove it
[01:44:54] <Cork> { radius: null }
[01:45:34] <Cork> that way all you need to check is if its === undefined (use old value); and === null (remove it)
[01:47:02] <walidvb> quick question before i go see my client: on http://www.and-one.ch/works , anyone knows why the images go down 1 pixel when animated? (click on the left menu items)
[01:49:28] <Cork> walidvb: you have an invalid html structure
[01:49:47] <Cork> li's always have to go inside an ul or ol element
[01:50:06] <Cork> <div><li> is invalid
[01:50:18] <mazzachre> I am using the JqueryUI date picker... I was wondering what the difference between setting an onSelect option and listening to onChange is? Is there any?
[01:50:21] <walidvb> true i forgot about that
[01:50:30] <walidvb> 2nd website i did, they want change
[01:50:35] <Cork> not saying this is the cause though
[01:50:41] <walidvb> (they never did anything on it anyways...)
[01:50:49] <walidvb> Cork: might be i'^ll give it a try
[01:50:54] <walidvb> gotta go in 5 though :D
[01:53:50] <Cork> mazzachre: onchange isn't a datepicker event
[01:53:55] <Cork> onselect is though
[01:54:34] <walidvb> Cork: hm doesn't seem to have been the issue
[01:54:42] <walidvb> any hint? otherwise i go
[01:55:09] <Cork> walidvb: would have to dig quite deep into what the animation does to tell
[01:55:18] <Cork> but its prob display or position changes
[01:55:30] <Cork> causing the element to have different proportions
[01:55:38] <walidvb> Cork: agree. never mind then, hope clients won't notice now :D
[01:55:48] <walidvb> btw, validating now ^^
[01:56:03] <Cork> anyway just say it'll be fixed if they ask
[01:56:09] <Cork> and look into it later
[01:56:20] <Cork> it's most likely not hard to fix
[01:56:50] <walidvb> Cork: hm i can't remember, but i know it came up at some point, and i was never able to get rid of it. i'll check another time
[01:56:51] <walidvb> thanks
[01:56:57] <xec_> walidvb: padding-top: 1px; on #proj-list
[01:56:59] <walidvb> and goodbye
[01:56:59] <mazzachre> Cork: Ya, I was wondering on listening to onchange on the input element I attached the datepicker to...
[01:57:13] <Cork> ah, border collapse
[01:57:20] <walidvb> xec_: yay. of course. then the pos abs ignores it
[01:57:24] <walidvb> thanks a lot
[01:57:39] <xec_> yw :)
[01:57:47] <Cork> mazzachre: datepicker won't trigger it
[01:57:55] <Cork> mazzachre: only if the user types in the field
[01:58:20] <mazzachre> Cork: OK, thx
[01:58:25] <Cork> np
[01:59:52] <walidvb> yay off i go bye bye!
[02:00:39] <mazzachre> btw, what is the reason that the "this" inside a each() function is not a jQuery object but the dom object?
[02:01:26] <Cork> cause each loops the array
[02:02:07] <Cork> if each would give you a jquery object it would have to wrap the result for each itteration
[02:02:28] <Cork> and if you don't need the jquery object that would be a waste
[02:07:18] <emericBZH> I am sorry I have another question
[02:07:38] <emericBZH> How in javascript I can explorer all the properties of an object ?
[02:08:29] <emericBZH> for example for this {width: '2px', color: 'red', radius: '1px'}
[02:09:34] <Cork> emericBZH: you have to loop it
[02:09:54] <Cork> emericBZH: best way is to use $.each
[02:10:04] <Cork> ?.each
[02:10:04] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[02:10:08] <Cork> ?jquery.each
[02:10:09] <bot-t> jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[02:10:26] <emericBZH> how can I do a loop with var1 = "width"; var2 = "2px"; then var1 = "color" and var2 = "red"
[02:10:40] <emericBZH> ah ok !
[02:10:44] <emericBZH> merci
[02:10:51] <emericBZH> thank's :-)
[02:13:50] <emericBZH> and if I am doing this each() function, it will not work on a string ?
[02:13:55] <emericBZH> what will it return ?
[02:14:22] <Cork> it will prob crash
[02:14:38] <Cork> either that or it will give you each character in the string
[02:14:41] <Cork> don't remember
[02:14:52] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i set an iframe source and after that i show the source value but it's undefined: $('#testiframe').attr('src',"testscript.php"); alert($('#testiframe').attr('src'));  What can be the mistake?
[02:15:26] <Cork> Krambiorix: you have to wait for the iframe to load
[02:15:32] <Cork> you can't do it like that
[02:16:16] <Cork> additionally iframes has a lot of restrictions to prevent information leakages
[02:16:28] <Cork> Krambiorix: you're loading a page from another domain?
[02:17:34] <Krambiorix> Cork, no, same domain
[02:18:06] <Cork> Krambiorix: try waiting for the page to be loaded
[02:19:45] <devswap> is it possible to animate between two img src's or is animated purely limited to css classes
[02:19:57] <Cork> you mean background-image?
[02:20:12] <Cork> or an actual img tag?
[02:25:20] <Krambiorix> Cork, how can i check if the page is loaded?
[02:25:33] <Cork> you bind the load event on the iframe
[02:25:36] <devswap> cork: no an image tag - I want to have an img as a button but animate it on mouse over to another image - basically a grey and black version of an icon
[02:25:38] <javalover> ok so the reason I was even using foreach is because when using foreach I can have a proper passing of the variable to a function
[02:25:45] <VX> [10:48:06] -bradbury.freenode.net:#jquery- [freenode-info] channel flooding and no channel staff around to help? Please check with freenode support: http://freen
[02:25:47] <javalover> if I use .each etc.  then the variable changes
[02:25:51] <VX> oops sorry
[02:25:56] <Cork> devswap: then you need two elements
[02:25:59] <javalover> how can I make sure that when looping I get the correct variable passed to my function?
[02:26:21] <Cork> devswap: its basically the same as you need if it was background-image
[02:26:28] <devswap> cork: so two elements overlaid and then animate opacity?
[02:26:50] <seutje> pseudos are awesome, just saying
[02:26:52] <Cork> javalover: store a copy in the scope
[02:27:01] <Cork> devswap: exactly
[02:27:02] <javalover> how?
[02:27:24] <Cork> javalover: var cache = value;
[02:27:38] <Cork> wait a min...
[02:27:44] <Cork> you should get the same with each
[02:27:50] <Cork> javalover: can you show the code you have problem with?
[02:27:56] <javalover> var b = myfacebookpostarray[elindex];
[02:28:06] <javalover> $.each(myfacebookpostarray, function(elindex,v){
[02:28:16] <javalover> var b = myfacebookpostarray[elindex];
[02:28:20] <Cork> why don't you just use v ?
[02:28:25] <javalover> srry it's out of order
[02:28:27] <javalover> I did use v
[02:28:33] <javalover> i'm just i've been messing with it
[02:29:04] <Cork> ?p @ javalover
[02:29:05] <bot-t> javalover, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:29:14] <javalover> listen cork
[02:29:20] <Cork> please make a complete dump of the section you have problem with
[02:29:29] <javalover> if I use myfacebookpostarray.forEach(function(v, elindex){   it's fine but
[02:29:41] <javalover> if i use $.each(myfacebookpostarray, function(elindex,v){
[02:29:43] <Cork> please make a complete dump of the section you have problem with
[02:29:52] <javalover> then it won't stay, dumps aren't needed just
[02:29:59] <javalover> how do I iterate through & keep the proper data?
[02:30:25] <Cork> that's why i need the dump, cause you're question doens't make sense
[02:30:31] <javalover> cuz i'm p assing it into a a.bind("click", function(){
[02:30:38] <javalover> sure it does
[02:30:43] <Cork> so, make a dump of the problem you have
[02:30:50] <javalover> because i'm iterating through myfacebookpostarray
[02:30:57] <javalover> and then I change myfacebookpostarray later on
[02:30:59] <javalover> so it changes the variables
[02:31:17] <javalover> i want to like finalize the variable
[02:47:03] <Tomashe> $("#sub_add_checksub_products_qty_^").attr('checked', false);
[02:47:11] <Tomashe> why is that ^ isnt working
[02:47:17] <Tomashe> did i do something wrong
[02:47:32] <Cork> ?.prop @ Tomashe
[02:47:32] <bot-t> Tomashe, .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[02:47:57] <Cork> attr will just change the dom attribute, you want to change the property
[02:48:21] <Tomashe> hmm
[02:48:22] <Tomashe> i c
[02:48:27] <Tomashe> what about this regex thing
[02:48:28] <Tomashe> ^
[02:49:31] <faraway> Tomashe: what do you want to achive with the '^' ?
[02:49:35] <Tomashe> i want to uncheck all the ids that start with sub_add_checksub_products_qty
[02:49:36] <Cork> ah the selector doens't match?
[02:49:47] <Cork> Tomashe: it's string match
[02:49:54] <Cork> it doesn't support regex
[02:49:58] <Tomashe> ok
[02:50:03] <Cork> if you want multiple elements use a class
[02:50:10] <Tomashe> so how do i tell it to look for everything that start with sub_add_checksub_products_qty....
[02:50:14] <Cork> if you want multiple elements use a class <--
[02:50:53] <Cork> id's isn't meant to be used to build find multiple elements, so there's no fast selector for it
[02:51:00] <Tomashe> i know there is a way to do it the way i want
[02:51:14] <Cork> ya, you need to list all the id's you want to match
[02:51:22] <Cork> with a comma inbetween
[02:51:35] <Cork> but.. you shouldn't do it like that
[02:52:01] <Tomashe> yes i know, but i dont have axx to the entire code so i cannt change somethings like add a class
[02:52:07] <Cork> it becomes cumbersome to manage, and it's slower then it needs to be
[02:52:08] <Tomashe> i need it that way
[02:52:20] <Tomashe> can u show me the code ?
[02:52:33] <Tomashe> to find it the way i want
[02:52:38] <Cork> $('#id1, #id2, #id3, .... #id999')
[02:52:44] <Tomashe> hmm
[02:52:48] <Cork> only way to do it
[02:53:06] <Cork> jquery has to loop over each of those and do document.getElementById()
[02:54:06] <Cork> while with a class is can simply do document.getElementsByClass
[02:54:32] <Tomashe> ok let me try
[02:55:57] <VX> Tomashe $("[id^=sub_add_checksub_products_qty]")
[02:56:06] <Cork> no...
[02:56:19] <Cork> that will select all elements on the page and loop over them looking for that attribute
[02:56:22] <Cork> its dead slow
[02:58:16] <VX> 'div[.^="sub_add_checksub_products_qty"]'  perhaps ?
[02:58:35] <Cork> .^ doens't exist
[02:58:56] <Cork> but yes $("div[id^=sub_add_checksub_products_qty]") is slightly better as that will only look at all divs on the page
[02:59:17] <Cork> you're throwing away all the browsers optimizations for id's though
[02:59:52] <Tomashe> ok seems to be working
[03:00:15] <Tomashe> thanks mate
[03:00:30] <Cork> Tomashe: you really, REALLY should ask someone with access to mod it though
[03:00:55] <Tomashe> this is only 3-4 checkboxs to alter , atm itts working fine
[03:00:59] <Tomashe> thanks my friend
[03:28:47] <Krambiorix> Cork, about the iframe source problem, you said to use onLoad, but can't i make something like "while not loaded"....
[03:29:32] <reloadz> hi! i use jquery UI disalog and in it i have some input fields - they have atribute "onchange", but the it cant find deffined funtion - function is deffined 100%
[03:31:37] <reloadz> help! PLZ! :(
[03:32:22] <Cork> Krambiorix: no, you need to listen for the event
[03:32:51] <Krambiorix> hmm
[03:32:56] <Cork> Krambiorix: while would hang the browser, cause the iframe would never start loading; cause you're code block never ends
[03:33:38] <Cork> reloadz: could you try to rephrase that question?
[03:36:28] <reloadz> I open a dialog
[03:36:47] <reloadz> in dialog i have input fields with atribute onchange
[03:37:07] <reloadz> function is deffined that is trg\iggeres by onclick atribute
[03:37:24] <reloadz> but firebug say it's not deffined!
[03:37:40] <reloadz> tho it shoes in source view
[03:37:45] <reloadz> thoe*
[03:38:08] <seutje> so it's like <input onchange="doStuff()" onclick="this.change()" /> ? o.O
[03:39:33] <reloadz> <input type="text" value="0" onchange="streight_update('st', '1002')">
[03:40:00] <Cork> and where do click come into the picture?
[03:40:02] <reloadz> and i have deffined streight_update
[03:40:24] <reloadz> SRY - i ment onchange
[03:40:43] <javalover> yo how can I during a for loop assign an arrays value to a variable
[03:40:57] <javalover> my problem is that, I assign the value but then I change the array & the variable changes...how can I fix this?
[03:41:05] <Cork> javalover: just post the pb link and we'll have a look
[03:41:31] <Cork> reloadz: oook, so the question is; you have an inline event attribute, and it can't find the function you define?
[03:41:47] <reloadz> yes
[03:41:48] <Cork> reloadz: where are you defining the function?
[03:42:03] <reloadz> before the dialog is deffined
[03:42:16] <reloadz> outside dialog function
[03:42:17] <Cork> in something like a click handler?
[03:42:28] <ItsJustMe> Could someone explain to me how appendTo works? I've tried the example codes in my script, but they are not adding anything. Need to add a div into my div #content
[03:42:59] <Cork> ItsJustMe: $('<span>extra</span>').appendTo('#content')
[03:43:11] <ItsJustMe> Tried it .. Doesn't worked ..
[03:43:31] <Cork> do you have multiple #content elements on the page?
[03:43:47] <ItsJustMe> Nope ..
[03:44:02] <ItsJustMe> It's an ID. You can only use it once, can't you? o.ô
[03:44:05] <ItsJustMe> Thought so xD
[03:44:16] <Cork> you can have it on multiple elements
[03:44:26] <Cork> but only the first of them will be referenced
[03:44:38] <Cork> $('[id="content"]').length
[03:45:05] <Cork> if thats != 1 then that's you're problem
[03:46:05] <seutje> at my previous job, I used a bookmarklet to check for duplicate IDs, cause my backend guys would constantly fuck it up
[03:46:16] <Cork> :)
[03:46:35] <Cork> and that's why i love not having a backend guy :)
[03:47:02] <Haprog> I'm my own backend+frontend guy :P
[03:47:43] <Cork> here everyone have to carry there new feature from db/backend all the way to the interface
[03:48:06] <Cork> no devision by server parts
[03:48:15] <seutje> https://gist.github.com/962685 here we go :P
[03:48:17] <ItsJustMe> okay, have it .. ^^
[03:48:18] <ItsJustMe> thanks :)
[03:48:35] <seutje> I like being able to focus on certain bits
[03:48:46] <seutje> and php stinks anyway
[03:49:03] <Cork> seutje: nice
[03:49:04] <Krambiorix> how can i check if there is a onload value of an element?
[03:49:05] <Haprog> Who says PHP is the only language for backend? :D
[03:49:18] <Haprog> (I do mostly PHP atm though)
[03:49:32] <seutje> well, I work at a drupal shop, so php is kind of a given :/
[03:49:35] <Cork> Krambiorix: by onload you mean an inline attribute?
[03:49:47] <Cork> Krambiorix: or an event listener
[03:49:51] <Cork> (or both)
[03:51:06] <Krambiorix> Cork, inline
[03:51:17] <Krambiorix> or if possible BOTH
[03:51:32] <Cork> $('selector').[0].onload != ""
[03:51:42] <Cork> its not possible to check for dom2 event listeners
[03:51:58] <Cork> you can check for events added through jquery though
[03:54:30] <Tomashe> anyone have any idea why my website LOADING FOR AGESSSS on iE
[03:54:30] <Tomashe> ?
[03:54:41] <Tomashe> other browsers working perfectly :/
[03:54:58] <javalover> ok
[03:55:01] <javalover> essentially it's this http://jsfiddle.net/gfmXa/14/
[03:55:29] <javalover> load that up & hit click me & you will see it clearly shows "changed" but I want it to show "hi"
[03:55:57] <javalover> now if I could use final variables then var b would be final
[03:56:09] <javalover> and I would not be able to change it outside the scope
[03:56:41] <Cork> Tomashe: b is a cached copy of the string in a
[03:56:44] <Cork> ops
[03:56:47] <Cork> wrong nick
[03:56:53] <Tomashe> hehe
[03:56:56] <Cork> it won't change just cause you changed the value in a
[03:56:59] <hemangpatel> How to urldecode in jquery ?
[03:57:13] <javalover> but it does look
[03:57:17] <javalover> you click it & it says "changed"
[03:57:24] <javalover> when I clearly assigned it before hand
[03:57:50] <Cork> ah sorry read it wrong
[03:57:53] <javalover> now although I do have the 2 functions the problem is I call the loop twice
[03:58:00] <Cork> ya, its cause your creating b in the same scope as a
[03:58:02] <javalover> and so B overwrites itself
[03:58:13] <javalover> no I don't this is a simulation problem
[03:58:15] <Cork> for doesn't create a scope
[03:58:18] <javalover> the problem is all variables are global
[03:58:28] <javalover> so how do I create a final variable?
[03:58:57] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/gfmXa/16/
[03:59:02] <Cork> or you could just use $.each
[03:59:38] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/gfmXa/17/
[04:00:16] <javalover> slightly confusing
[04:00:27] <Cork> ah, no each will loop the modifications too
[04:01:01] <javalover> this is almost good
[04:01:09] <javalover> but i only want function to alert 1 time
[04:01:26] <javalover> hmmm maybe though
[04:01:34] <javalover> considering my code only assigns to 1 thing lemme check
[04:02:15] <Cork> wait a min... how the f* did the old for loop only bind one alert...
[04:02:31] <javalover> lol idk
[04:02:39] <Cork> your looping an array with two values, you should get two event listeners
[04:02:45] <javalover> i know right
[04:02:46] <javalover> wtf
[04:03:13] <Cork> javalover: ok, so $.each does the correct thing
[04:03:43] <Cork> btw your doing something dangers in your code
[04:04:00] <Cork> you should never do a[new_value] = value
[04:04:17] <Cork> if the number haven't been in the array before it should always be added with .push
[04:04:26] <javalover> well...tbh
[04:04:29] <javalover> i empty the array first
[04:04:32] <Cork> cause arrays doesn't support unorderd array values
[04:04:39] <javalover> but this was just a mockup so you can see the problem
[04:04:49] <Cork> ya, but ex. a[5] = 'new' a.length == 6
[04:04:52] <Cork> not 3
[04:04:59] <javalover> i set a.length = 0;
[04:05:13] <Cork> uh, you're missing the point
[04:05:17] <javalover> OMG!
[04:05:21] <javalover> wait hold up a second
[04:05:32] <javalover> holy efff
[04:05:33] <javalover> IT WORKS!
[04:05:42] <Cork> yes you can set .length
[04:05:52] <Cork> if that's what you mean
[04:05:52] <javalover> oh my goodness Cork you genius!
[04:05:59] <Cork> ?
[04:06:40] <javalover> it's workingggg
[04:06:51] <javalover> but you're saying about reusing the array?
[04:07:11] <javalover> tbh my code does this, "gather fbook data store in myfbookarray"
[04:07:12] <Cork> var a = []; a.push('hi'); a.push('bye')
[04:07:21] <javalover> loop, gather data again
[04:07:56] <javalover> and then when writing the data it was having an issue
[04:08:14] <Cork> javalover: there's little point in describing what you're code does
[04:08:26] <javalover> but i'm saying
[04:08:28] <javalover> i'm using .load
[04:08:50] <javalover> so the array is being used twice..but not on purpose
[04:08:55] <javalover> if it were up to me it would create a whole new array
[04:09:25] <javalover> but javascript doesn't work like java......it just keeps stuff for no reason
[04:09:48] <javalover> sooo what I did was I set array.length = 0;
[04:10:22] <javalover> so i'm totally open to suggestions as to how I should do this
[04:11:59] <xec_> Cork: your* ;D
[04:12:18] <Cork> gah...
[04:12:21] <Cork> lol
[04:12:25] <Cork> typo
[04:12:57] <Cork> xec: you're a hard man to please ;P
[04:13:10] <xec_> that sounded dirty to me for some reason
[04:13:10] <javalover> well in any event it effing works
[04:13:14] <javalover> no more explorer bugsss!!
[04:13:23] <javalover> imma go pass out if that's aight with you guys
[04:13:50] <Cork> javalover: for future problems, when you ask ppl for help give them the information they need to help you
[04:14:05] <javalover> you have a point cork, the fiddle was easy
[04:14:16] <javalover> i just sometimes I feel like I have a big block of code & want to simplify it
[04:14:39] <javalover> didn't realize I could just code a mini version....and in coding it I was able to see my own problem more
[04:14:57] <javalover> i'm still learning, been coding for like 7 years now but still learning
[04:15:36] <xec_> Cork: i'm the first person to appreciate all the help you provide in here, learned a lot from you. please take my grammar nazi comments as a token of affection ;)
[04:15:50] <Cork> javalover: that last part is actually one of the big reasons why you should make a testcase
[04:16:05] <Cork> javalover: often you don't need to ask for help, simply by doing it :)
[04:16:24] <javalover> yeah *sigh* it's just i've been on this project for so long
[04:16:26] <javalover> it depresses me
[04:16:41] <javalover> i wanted to code something useful today but all I faced was explorer going BLAH YOUR CODE SUCKS!!
[04:16:59] <Cork> xec: no offense taken, actually its appreciated (at reasonable amounts)
[04:17:11] <javalover> anyways thx Cork for all ur help
[04:17:30] <javalover> I mean that, it's people like you who help others to succede & I hope I can be as big of a help
[04:17:39] <Cork> javalover: welcome to the world of web development
[04:17:55] <Cork> where you spend 10% getting the page to work and 90% getting it to work in ie
[04:17:57] <javalover> it's impressed me...but I feel one day I will be like zuckerburg
[04:18:08] <javalover> lolololo
[04:18:24] <Cork> to be honest though, its getting much better
[04:18:31] <Cork> ie6 was a real killer
[04:18:33] <javalover> on that note, imma catch some z's
[04:19:20] <zzzzzzLover> zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz   mmmmm zzzzzzzz
[04:20:21] <xec_> lol
[04:20:33] <xec_> don't spend all your z's in one place!
[04:23:04] <asker> hey guys, im trying to upload files via ajax using jquery like this: http://pastie.org/5136985
[04:23:28] <asker> #file: <input type="file" id="file"> but i dont know how to handle it in php
[04:23:49] <asker> in filename is just a fakepath to the file and i cant move it somewhere, what im doing wrong
[04:25:27] <Ry> try #php if it's a server side question?
[04:26:02] <asker> nah this request i posted doesnt upload the file to the server
[04:26:06] <asker> its just send the path
[04:26:23] <asker> the file has to be uploaded before i can handle it in php
[04:28:22] <Cork> asker: you can't upload a file through ajax like that
[04:28:32] <Ry> yes, but what you're sending from the client is wrong also
[04:28:36] <Cork> you need to use the new file api to actually grab the data for the file
[04:28:43] <Cork> ?mdc file

[04:29:25] <Cork> asker: all your uploading right now is the filename of the file
[04:29:37] <Ry> I'd recommend one of the many file upload query plugins
[04:29:49] <asker> cork: yap, that was my prob
[04:29:57] <Chris_CC> Hey guys ... quick question ... I am returning some information via "$.post('query_shout_insert.php',  	{id: id, type: type, content: content}, 	function(data)" ... but how do i return things like php variables within data?
[04:30:02] <Ry> but on the php side, you shouldn't be checking post variables for the actual file, they have a $_FILES() or something from what i remember
[04:30:23] <asker> ry: $_POST ;)
[04:30:27] <asker> $_FILES*
[04:30:30] <asker> i mean :p
[04:30:35] <Cork> Chris_CC: what the php echos out in the page is whats sent to the client
[04:30:40] <asker> kk ty
[04:30:49] <Cork> Chris_CC: if you want to send multiple values use json
[04:31:22] <Chris_CC> Cork: that's teh problem I'm new to jqyery and not sure if I'm using the correct function, i want to return variables instead of an echo ... json?
[04:32:33] <Cork> Chris_CC: set the header content-type to application/json, and use json_encode
[04:32:52] <Chris_CC> Cork: hmm not heard of that before I'l look into it see if it's what i need
[04:32:53] <Cork> Chris_CC: build an assosiated array and echo the result
[04:33:20] <Cork> Chris_CC: if you do that jquery will parse your response as json by it self
[04:33:44] <Cork> and the data variable from your callback will contain the variables from your json
[04:53:40] <Alexnet> with until 5 words. Why jquery rather dojo?
[04:54:41] <Alexnet> *rather than
[05:02:47] <ItsJustMe> Again me .. How may I add a li to a ul? Doesn't work: $("#sortable ul").add("li"); $("#content_sortable > li:nth-child(4)").attr("id","TestID");
[05:03:56] <Cronoh> do u even google? the answer however is $('ul
[05:03:59] <Cronoh> oops
[05:04:01] <xec_> .append("<li />") might work
[05:04:09] <xec_> instead of the .add
[05:04:10] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/nUCce/ - how do I extend the search bar on hover/click?
[05:04:16] <Cronoh> $('ul').append('<li />'); yes
[05:04:49] <xec_> ItsJustMe: but you're probably better off creating the li first and hanging on to the reference so you don't need to query for it again later
[05:06:03] <xec_> ItsJustMe: something like, var item = $("<li />"); item.appendTo("#sortable ul"); item.attr("id", "testId");
[05:06:10] <ItsJustMe> I googled it Cronoh. Just thought it would be the quick'n'dirty version of it. Didn't knew add really wouldn't be able to.
[05:06:12] <ItsJustMe> Sorry ^^
[05:07:00] <xec_> depending on what you're really trying to do, of course
[05:10:30] <ItsJustMe> okay, don't work anyway .. afk ^^ thx & cu
[05:17:43] <Qdest> Can I use removeClass('class', 300) even though people might not have jQ UI loaded?
[05:17:49] <greek> Hi fellas. I have a <select> menu. Its <option> elements contain strings and their corresponding value attributes contain integer IDs. I'm trying to use jQuery to get the ID value of an option whose string is "Foo".
[05:18:09] <Qdest> So, in theory, if they do they'll get the animation, if not well.. just removeClass() as is.
[05:19:47] <xec_> Qdest: what? you can't animate the removal of a class
[05:20:09] <xec_> Qdest: oh, unless there's some jquery ui magic i'm not aware of
[05:20:32] <Qdest> Isn't that a primary functionality of UI? :o
[05:20:35] <CodesStuff> greek: When selecting input elements (and selects), it's better to fetch the whole object and iterate through it imo.
[05:20:53] <CodesStuff> ? .each() @greek
[05:21:01] <faraway_> abletony84: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/nUCce/2/
[05:21:06] <xec_> Qdest: nevermind me, i didn't see you mention "ui". there is a jquery core method with the same name that just removes the class :)
[05:21:10] <CodesStuff> ?demo
[05:21:15] <CodesStuff> Yep. Bot-t is gone.
[05:21:24] <CodesStuff> My life now has no meaning.
[05:21:28] <xec_> lol
[05:22:29] <Qdest> xec_: My point exactly! So, basically what they've done is add the 2nd arg, as in removeClass([class], [speed/animation duration])
[05:22:47] <CodesStuff> So I coded a native windows application in C++, Javascript/jquery, and PHP. How awesome am I?
[05:22:55] <CodesStuff> Pretty awesome if I do say so myself.
[05:22:57] <Qdest> So xec_ the question is really, can I pass the 2nd arg WITHOUT having the UI loaded and it won't break cause of it?
[05:22:58] <greek> CodesStuff, ok I can get access to the <select> element in question, so for example, I have $("select.foo") and now I'm trying to get the value of its option whose text is "moo"
[05:23:16] <CodesStuff> greek: jsfiddle it, please :P
[05:23:20] <niggler> CodesStuff: how did you compile javascript?
[05:23:20] <CodesStuff> I'll take a peek for ya
[05:23:27] <xec_> Qdest: i believe core would just ignore the second argument, yes
[05:23:40] <CodesStuff> niggler: Webkit + HTML and JS depedencies
[05:23:44] <Qdest> Marvelous, thank you
[05:23:45] <CodesStuff> Also nice name lmao.
[05:23:51] <xec_> Qdest: but it's a pretty simple thing to just test and make sure
[05:24:01] <xec_> don't take my word for it
[05:24:10] <Qdest> I was just about to do that, I figured I'd have to select a nice duration anyway :p
[05:24:11] <niggler> but you didn't compile the js into assembly
[05:24:17] <CodesStuff> xec_: You're a beautiful person and deserve only the best in the world.
[05:24:23] <hooloovoo> CodesStuff: isn't there even frameworks for that?
[05:24:23] <CodesStuff> There's my compliment of the day.
[05:24:31] <xec_> wow, that was unexpected
[05:24:33] <CodesStuff> hooloovoo: QT by Nokia
[05:24:39] <CodesStuff> http://qt-project.org/downloads
[05:24:41] * xec_ is filled with joy
[05:25:41] <hooloovoo> CodesStuff: there's this too http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/wiki/Architecture
[05:26:05] <greek> CodesStuff, I'm not sure what there is to jsfiddle. I have a select menu. It has 2 options A and B, and their respective values are 1 and 2.
[05:26:30] <greek> Sorry if I'm sounding like a pain. I think I've miscommunicated the simplicity of my problem
[05:27:10] <CodesStuff> greek: You haven't - I just don't feel like writing even the simplest of code right now.
[05:27:19] <CodesStuff> hooloovoo: Is that Chrome's Javascript engine?
[05:28:36] <CodesStuff> Oh I see. hooloovoo, the cool thing about QT is that it's cross-platform and has a bunch of nice widgets. You can even use stylesheets to style your widgets (literally background-color: #3d3d3d; and stuff)
[05:28:39] <Alexnet> Niggler:the browser does not run assembly
[05:28:56] <CodesStuff> Alexnet: It still pushes arrays into memory directly :P
[05:29:01] <CodesStuff> see /r/netsec/
[05:29:10] <niggler> Alexnet: "CodesStuff: So I coded a native windows application in C++, Javascript/jquery, and PHP. How awesome am I?"
[05:29:22] <niggler> I'm trying to understand how "native" CodesStuff went
[05:29:29] <CodesStuff> Oh no, not that native.
[05:29:33] <AdamPDotty> greek: I see nothing better than iteration
[05:29:40] <CodesStuff> I haven't messed with Assembly (win32 at that!) since 2009
[05:29:51] <CodesStuff> And even then I was just making game hacks
[05:30:13] <CodesStuff> niggler: http://gramblr.com/ - not that fancy.
[05:31:00] <niggler> 80% of my coding is x86_64 :/
[05:31:20] <CodesStuff> I custom-compiled QWebKit and QT, then coded the delegation for links and XHR's (to bypass the same origin policy), coded the HTML/JS/etc and added the files as dependancies and referenced them in C++
[05:31:24] <Tobsn> hey, its about rewriting a tag with bootstrap and a dropdown - if someone has a better idea: http://jsfiddle.net/tobsn/LyQYy/
[05:31:47] <CodesStuff> Also, the cool thing about QWebkit is they have this cool little NetworkBridge class which allows you to invoke native functions via Javascript
[05:32:11] <niggler> CodesStuff: why not integrate v8
[05:32:46] <CodesStuff> I wanted to familiarize myself with QT for a future project, niggler (a blackberry Instagram client).
[05:33:12] <CodesStuff> It needed to be able to have ad support for non-premium users, so I chose webkit
[05:33:17] <niggler> QT is a PITA
[05:34:54] <CodesStuff> niggler: It's annoying to compile (especially with Webkit). the first two times I forgot a couple flags for mingw
[05:35:03] <CodesStuff> so I had to recompile again XD
[05:37:38] <Tobsn> anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/tobsn/LyQYy/
[05:39:09] <CodesStuff> tobsn: What's the issue here?
[05:39:25] <Tobsn> its working, just curiious if you could make it better
[05:40:04] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/tobsn/LyQYy/6/
[05:40:13] <Zac12> data-rel='back' does not work on opera mini, is there maybe a work around for this?
[05:40:14] <CodesStuff> My opinion on hacks like this is as follows, tobsn: If it works, don't break it by trying to fix it :D
[05:40:34] <Tobsn> just curious if there is a smarter way to do it
[05:40:38] <CodesStuff> Zac12: Opera should allow an html5 compliant data attribute :\
[05:41:03] <Tobsn> especially the on click on the li... i'd expect it to be more like a bind to the ul and then event on "change"
[05:41:06] <Tobsn> but that didnt work at all
[05:41:23] <CodesStuff> Oh
[05:41:43] <greek> Ok I think I cracked thanks guys
[05:42:02] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/tobsn/LyQYy/7/
[05:42:04] <Tobsn> its getting nicer
[05:42:06] <Tobsn> still feels weird
[05:44:39] <seutje> Tobsn: change parents to closest
[05:44:58] <seutje> Tobsn: change .find('.btn:first') to .find('.btn').first()
[05:45:43] <seutje> Tobsn: also, don't re-scope the selectors on this each time, but cache this and go from there
[05:45:53] <Tobsn> http://jsfiddle.net/tobsn/LyQYy/
[05:45:55] <Tobsn> see updated version
[05:46:34] <Tobsn> (im already caching)

[05:48:51] <Tobsn> why would you cache $(this) ?
[05:48:55] <seutje> ?doesn't work
[05:48:56] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[05:48:57] <seutje> there we go
[05:50:06] <CodesStuff> seutje: but it doesn't work.
[05:51:35] <seutje> CodesStuff:  sure it does

[05:54:16] <PBDev> QUESTION: I want to write a jquery code that take a number in a textbox, and then depending on that value I specify the number of image uploads I will do?
[05:55:22] <hooloovoo> PBDev: That's not a question, it's a statment with a question mark at the end =P
[05:56:28] <EHLOVader> FACT: Your desires exceed your ability.
[05:56:56] <Qdest> http://jsfiddle.net/4uPb2/1/ <-- someone care to take a look and see possible improvements?
[05:56:58] <EHLOVader> FACT: You came to the jquery channel on freenode to find out how to accomplish your wanted task.
[05:57:49] <EHLOVader> FACT Bears eat beets.
[05:57:50] <EHLOVader> Bears.
[05:57:50] <EHLOVader> Beets.
[05:57:50] <EHLOVader> Battlestar Galactica.
[05:58:10] <hooloovoo> trolling?
[05:59:23] <EHLOVader> good morning hooloovoo
[05:59:41] <EHLOVader> I wonder if they want to have a textbox in the form which is updated with the number of files that were attempted to upload
[06:00:08] <EHLOVader> then if PBDev was using multiple postbacks then to upload the files instead of a single multifile upload
[06:01:06] <seutje> Qdest: no need to use "jQuery" when using a closure like that, you can just use "$"
[06:02:13] <seutje> Qdest: don't re-wrap jquery collections
[06:02:43] <seutje> like item = jQuery(this); sub_menu = jQuery(item).children('ul');
[06:02:51] <seutje> those seem to be dwelling in the global scope btw
[06:03:54] <nchlssmith1> Qdest: you need to define submenu before using it.  Check out the firebug console
[06:04:51] <seutje> Qdest: this plugin breaks chaining, make sure u return the jquery collection
[06:06:02] <seutje> Qdest: when making a plugin, it's generally best to apply it separately to all the elements in the passed collection, most plugins combine this with chaining and go all return this.each(function() { /* do work */ });
[06:08:34] <PBDev> QUESTION: why doesn't this code work, when it works in fiddle?

[06:09:54] <seutje> holy*
[06:09:56] <treeprogram> Hi, could someone explain to a jquery newbie how jQuery.getJSON() works: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[06:10:44] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/nUCce/16/ - how do I make my search bar extend to 220px on click and hover?
[06:10:49] <CodesStuff> treeprogram: Did you just ask how something works and then link to the documentation?
[06:12:38] <treeprogram> CodesStuff yes yes I realize how silly that seems, but I'm really a newbie, so I don't understand the references used, and I want to grab some JSON from a webpage without having to learn jQuery first
[06:13:09] <CodesStuff> treeprogram: Which website is it?
[06:13:18] <treeprogram> wolframalpha.com
[06:13:29] <CodesStuff> treeprogram: Do they have JSONP support?
[06:13:56] <seutje> .on doesn't work for hover, does it?
[06:14:17] <treeprogram> CodesStuff I'm assuming they do based on the fact that this exists in the source code of the answer page: "context.jsonArray.popups.pod_0100.push"
[06:15:15] <seutje> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/nUCce/17/
[06:15:16] <abletony84> seutje: i think so
[06:15:23] <abletony84> hmm :)
[06:15:32] <CodesStuff> treeprogram: I'm looking at their API and it looks like they only allow XML for their API responses.
[06:15:41] <CodesStuff> Are you grabbing it from their actual site?
[06:15:54] <abletony84> touchend.. really cool man..
[06:16:12] <CodesStuff> If so, fetch the information by proxy (PHP, Python, etc), then iterate through the members and spit it out
[06:16:22] <seutje> abletony84: it might trigger when they start their touch outside of it, drag into it and then release
[06:16:51] <CodesStuff> so something like: <?php $json = file_get_contents("http://wolframalpha.com/herp/derp.json"); echo $json; ?>
[06:17:00] <treeprogram> CodesStuff thanks for the info. They allow querying through a query string, so I was assuming that I could grab do the query using the GET method, then grab the answer from the actual site
[06:17:01] <CodesStuff> That's assuming it's in a valid JSON object
[06:17:20] <devswap> can anyone think of a reason why hover shouldnt work - whatever the selector it isnt detecting any hovers
[06:17:26] <CodesStuff> (You might want to set the header("Content-Type: text/json"); though
[06:17:30] <abletony84> seutje: is touchend similar to hoverIntent in any way you think?
[06:17:46] <seutje> abletony84: it's the end of a touch event
[06:17:59] <abletony84> i heard the jquery developers saying hoverIntent-like features should not be part of the core or something like that
[06:17:59] <seutje> abletony84: in no way related to hoverintent
[06:18:02] <treeprogram> CodesStuff so the jQuery.getJSON() method won't be useful here?
[06:18:06] <abletony84> ah ok
[06:18:15] <seutje> abletony84: you're not making any sense right now :P
[06:18:27] <seutje> hoverintent is a plugin to delay mouseenter/out
[06:18:30] <CodesStuff> treeprogram: You will run into the Same Origin Policy unless Wolfram Alpha allows cross-domain XHR's
[06:18:35] <abletony84> doesnt hoverintent also calculate when mouse movements end, like touchend?
[06:18:38] <seutje> touchend is a standardized event for touch-capable devices
[06:18:47] <abletony84> i guess the arrival of tablets changed the game
[06:18:56] <abletony84> oh i see.. cool cool
[06:19:00] <seutje> they're completely unrelated
[06:19:11] <abletony84> hehe i see that now :)
[06:19:18] <seutje> very much like apples and oranges
[06:19:33] <seutje> they both deal with nutrients, but that's about the end of the similarities :P
[06:19:59] <treeprogram> CodesStuff ah I see. Well just in case cross-domain XHR's are allowed, any pointers on how to use getJSON()?
[06:20:33] <abletony84> :D
[06:21:55] <CodesStuff> treeprogram: do you have a url for me?
[06:22:07] <CodesStuff> Like, which page are you trying to fetch?
[06:22:12] <abletony84> seutje: i did it! http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/nUCce/19/
[06:22:20] <treeprogram> CodesStuff yes: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=new+york+population
[06:22:29] <abletony84> many thx..
[06:22:41] <asker> hey guys, im trying to make ajax request and run a function on success with additional params
[06:23:25] <seutje> abletony84: don't repeat the ID
[06:23:26] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/nUCce/20/
[06:23:30] <seutje> more decoupled
[06:24:02] <seutje> now you can like $('#search, #anothersearch').on('touchend mouseenter', expandSearch);
[06:24:09] <CodesStuff> treeprogram: I don't see the json call in my debug panel
[06:24:13] <seutje> without having to repeat that again
[06:24:43] <abletony84> ah, thats gr8 man..
[06:24:47] <asker> http://pastie.org/5137445
[06:24:53] <asker> is it possible somehow?
[06:24:55] <seutje> abletony84: kinda funny, I just had to make pretty much exactly the same thing
[06:24:55] <treeprogram> CodesStuff ah ok thanks
[06:25:01] <CodesStuff> treeprogram: context.jsonArray.popups.pod_0400.push( {"stringified": "17.8 million people  (New York-Newark, NY-NJ-CT urban area)\n(2000 estimate)","mInput": "","mOutput": "", "popLinks": {} });
[06:25:01] <abletony84> hehe
[06:25:08] <treeprogram> CodesStuff so I'll go with your suggestion
[06:25:14] <abletony84> seutje: im known to inspire others :)
[06:25:15] <devswap> sorry to be a pain - can anyone thing of why a hover function would be ignoring hovers
[06:25:22] <CodesStuff> It looks like they do an XHR, treeprogram, to fetch some Javascript
[06:25:26] <CodesStuff> then they push it into an array
[06:25:52] <abletony84> no im not, BUT
[06:26:04] <abletony84> this DOES make ones search bars beautiful yet discrete
[06:26:07] <CodesStuff> So in order to do this you'd need to navigate through the DOM, parse the scripts on the page manually, then collect the data
[06:26:24] <CodesStuff> Since it's dynamic and you're new, I don't think you'll get too far
[06:28:02] <treeprogram> CodesStuff yea it'd be better to use a language I'm familiar with
[06:28:07] <seutje> abletony84: well, I kept my animations in CSS, all my JS does is toggle a class
[06:28:31] <seutje> abletony84: and I'm only doing it on click, which also fires on touch devices, albeit a couple ms later
[06:28:42] <treeprogram> CodesStuff thanks a lot for the advice
[06:29:22] <faraway_> asker: http://pastie.org/5137465
[06:29:45] <seutje> abletony84: this is what I'm using (forced to use old ass jquery) http://pastebin.com/CA3YWd22
[06:29:52] <CodesStuff> np, treeprogram. Btw if you're interested in learning some coding, check out 3dbuzz.com
[06:30:02] <CodesStuff> Lot's of great video tutorials available there for free
[06:30:10] <CodesStuff> all of them are aimed at the absolute beginner
[06:30:21] <abletony84> seutje: why are you forced?
[06:30:48] <seutje> abletony84: because there's some things that might break if I upgrade it
[06:30:49] <treeprogram> CodesStuff perfect, thanks!
[06:31:16] <abletony84> cant have that happen..
[06:32:21] <abletony84> seutje: is there a smart way to make it go back to 20 in width when you leave?
[06:32:44] <abletony84> i imagine it would be good to use hoverintent to prevent accidental leaves?
[06:32:45] <apathy-> hey, could anyone help me resolve an issue with jquery datatables; specifically with IE8 whining about "stop running this script" on larger data sets?

[06:34:37] <seutje> abletony84: you'd prolly have to split up the touchend and mouseleave then
[06:34:56] <seutje> because otherwise the mouseleave will be triggered instantly for touch devices, no?
[06:38:17] <abletony84> seutje: correct..

[06:54:40] <SolarBoom> Sorry for past in channel
[06:54:42] <SolarBoom> http://jsfiddle.net/9rZ2H/
[06:54:43] <xec_> the "function(result) { alert(this) }" doesn't make an awful lot of sense though, SolarBoom
[06:55:09] <xec_> SolarBoom: maybe you wanted console.log(result) instead of that alert
[06:55:31] <SolarBoom> xec_: that's good
[06:56:01] <xec_> ?alert
[06:56:02] <bot-t> Forget alertâuse console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâs built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[06:56:13] <seutje> what's this in that context?
[06:56:46] <SolarBoom> xec_: I got me wrong I said good for console.log()
[06:57:11] <xec_> SolarBoom: i'm not sure what that means
[06:57:29] <SolarBoom> sorry you got me wrong I mean
[06:58:03] <xec_> SolarBoom: anyway, what i really wanted to point out was that you probably want "result" instead of "this"
[06:58:30] <seutje> xec_: actually, I think he's trying to reference the <a> that fired the event
[06:58:57] <xec_> aha
[06:59:02] <xec_> SolarBoom: is that correct?
[06:59:41] <SolarBoom> xec_: Yeah I know I tried to do smth, got wrong decided to troubleshoot
[06:59:48] <abletony84> seutje: what do u think of this approach? http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/nUCce/21/
[07:00:27] <xec_> SolarBoom: well - answer the question. what are you trying to do? are you looking for the <a> element or the ajax result?
[07:01:29] <seutje> abletony84: changed find() to $(this).find() -> http://jsfiddle.net/nUCce/22/
[07:01:40] <mbrochh> hey friends. something in a plugin that I use is manipulating the .html() of one of my elements. I can't for the life of me figure out which line sets the .html() so I wondered if it would be possible to monkeypatch jQuery's .html() method so that I can pu a breakpoint and see from the stacktrace where the bad code is?
[07:01:46] <abletony84> oh wow
[07:01:54] <abletony84> seutje: perfect .. thanks again
[07:01:56] <SolarBoom> xec_: Actually I wanted to get clicked elements attribute
[07:02:37] <seutje> I didn't even know about window.find
[07:02:51] <seutje> not part of any standard though, maybe that's why
[07:03:11] <timing> mbrochh: I think that's possible, just don't use the minimized version of jquery :-)
[07:03:23] <abletony84> :D
[07:03:55] <abletony84> its my belief that the more descrete, the more it will pay off in the long run
[07:04:29] <xec_> SolarBoom: then you can cache the element, or the attribute
[07:04:29] <abletony84> * discrete
[07:04:44] <xec_> SolarBoom: before you fire off the ajax (or rather, in the scope outside)
[07:04:47] <SolarBoom> xec_: how with ajax?
[07:04:55] <seutje> mbrochh: http://jsfiddle.net/juEnf/
[07:05:30] <seutje> mbrochh: lemme know if u want it to keep a reference to what line/char called it, pretty sure that's possible as well
[07:06:16] <mbrochh> seutje: i need it to keep it's original implementation because it is called several times before the shit happens but your code gives me an idea, let me try...
[07:07:40] <SolarBoom> xec_: how to get content of element's attribute?
[07:07:43] <mbrochh> seutje: ok i already got as far as your solution suggests but then the plugin i am using does not work any more, i get Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Window] has no method 'click'
[07:07:56] <xec_> SolarBoom: just set a variable in the click handler
[07:08:14] <xec_> SolarBoom: check out http://jsfiddle.net/9rZ2H/1/
[07:08:21] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i try this: $('#testiframe').onload = function(){loggedOut('test');}; then i do $('#testiframe').load('src',"testscript");   -> but the function loggedOut is never called
[07:08:37] <seutje> mbrochh: http://jsfiddle.net/juEnf/1/ like that?
[07:09:01] <seutje> Krambiorix: that's not how .load works
[07:09:07] <mbrochh> ah you have to call it with .call? ok i'll try
[07:09:13] <SolarBoom> xec_: Thank you! :) That's really helped me
[07:09:16] <seutje> Krambiorix: use .prop('src', 'testscript') instead
[07:09:32] <seutje> mbrochh: yeah, so I can pass the original context
[07:09:52] <Krambiorix> seutje, prop is not a function
[07:09:58] <mbrochh> seutje: isn't that method supposed to return something in case you call just .html() without parameters?
[07:10:04] <seutje> Krambiorix: using old jquery eh?
[07:10:09] <seutje> Krambiorix: use attr then
[07:10:18] <seutje> mbrochh: oh shit, right :x
[07:10:30] <seutje> mbrochh: 2 secs :P
[07:10:51] <Krambiorix> seutje, function wasn't called :s
[07:11:14] <seutje> mbrochh: actually, it always returns something, it returns the set you called it on when changing the html :P
[07:11:16] <seutje> mbrochh: http://jsfiddle.net/juEnf/2/
[07:11:18] <asker> i have several ajax-calls in a for-loop, how can i make the loop continues when a request is done?
[07:11:19] <asker> http://pastie.org/5137660
[07:11:23] <mbrochh> seutje: i just added a return, it seems to work... now let's see if the stack trace reveals what I need to know :) thanks a lot! you are awesome!
[07:11:37] <seutje> lies, I'm not
[07:12:27] <seutje> asker: $.ajax returns a deferred object, use it's done method
[07:12:35] <seutje> ?deferreds @ asker

[07:13:00] <frantz> Anyone familiar with animating margins on mousein?
[07:13:05] <SolarBoom> xec_: here .data for what?
[07:13:20] <xec_> SolarBoom: just to read the data-my-attribute value
[07:13:41] <xec_> SolarBoom: use .attr() instead
[07:13:43] <frantz> I am using BxSlider plugin for a slider and when I click on the left/right arrows I'd like it to show a bit of the next slide before clicking, to sort of let the user know there is another slide
[07:13:54] <xec_> (you mentioned you needed an attribute)
[07:13:55] <frantz> how would I do this?
[07:14:09] <SolarBoom> xec_: .data() is jquery's function?
[07:14:15] <xec_> correct
[07:14:19] <xec_> ?data
[07:14:20] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[07:15:34] <xec_> frantz: shouldn't be too difficult, if you're sure the plugin is animating the margin
[07:16:06] <xec_> frantz: could you make a small prototype of the slider in a demo at jsfiddle.net ?
[07:16:34] <xec_> frantz: or you could just look at the documentation, see ?animate
[07:16:35] <bot-t> frantz, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[07:16:55] <SolarBoom> xec_: but I can't undertstand I data() fetched content from data-my-attribute?
[07:17:18] <xec_> SolarBoom: "I data() fetched content" what?
[07:18:13] <xec_> SolarBoom: i only did that because you mentioned you wanted to read an attribute from the <a> element. is that not what you wanted?
[07:18:36] <SolarBoom> xec_:  no I wanted just get class name
[07:19:16] <xec_> SolarBoom: okay, that's usually stored as an attribute. use .attr("class")
[07:19:18] <jacks_appendix> Hello, Is it possible to wrap document fragments with jquery? Seems to be not working. eg: $('<p></p>').wrap('<div />')
[07:21:09] <xec_> jacks_appendix: iirc .wrap() returns the original collection (not including the wrapping element). maybe that's the culprit?
[07:21:17] <frantz> Hmm.. doesn't seem to be working
[07:21:32] <xec_> jacks_appendix: in your case it would just return the original <p>
[07:22:30] <xec_> frantz: if you get a live demo up and running we could have a look-see
[07:22:30] <frantz> how do I tell it to animate the div of the slider?
[07:22:36] <frantz> k give me a sec
[07:23:01] <SolarBoom> xec_:  That was okay, I got what I wanted :)
[07:25:33] <jacks_appendix> xec_, yeah, that's exactly what it's doing. I was looking for a way for it to return a div with paragraph child.
[07:26:13] <PBDev> QUESTION: how can I post a value from jquery to another variable for processing? like $_POST
[07:27:20] <faraway_> PBDev: with $_POST you mean php's $_POST ?
[07:27:53] <Krambiorix> seutje, still, loggedOut() has not been called: $('#testiframe').onload = function(){loggedOut('test');};
[07:27:53] <Krambiorix> $('#testiframe').attr('src',"testscript.php");
[07:28:13] <xec_> jacks_appendix: how about just doing $("<div><p></p></div>")
[07:28:16] <PBDev> yeah. I have value i in jquery, but I want to use the variable i in the jquery to make comparison in the php $i
[07:28:24] <clocKwize> Krambiorix, I think you can only attach events to an iframe if the iframe src is in the same domain as the current page
[07:28:45] <Krambiorix> clocKwize, it is
[07:29:44] <jacks_appendix> xec_, That's what i'm going to end up doing. I just though it would be cleaner/legible to use wrap() since the html in the fragment is within a variable, like so: $(fromSomeWhere)
[07:29:53] <jacks_appendix> xec_: thanks for the help :)
[07:30:04] <faraway_> PBDev: well you can always do a ajax request to send the data form the browser to your server
[07:30:16] <PBDev> how do I do that?
[07:30:40] <Krambiorix> anyone else?
[07:30:47] <xec_> jacks_appendix: then i'd probably do $("<div />").append(fromSomeWhere)
[07:30:50] <EHLOVader> has anyone here used slickgrid to impelement a large data set? and possibly seen an iphone esque contact current location in alphabet slider?
[07:31:17] <Probeee> guys can i insert function inside $('.show-thank-you').show();
[07:31:19] <faraway_> PBDev: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[07:31:19] <xec_> jacks_appendix: or maybe .html() instead
[07:31:20] <Probeee> ?
[07:31:37] <EHLOVader> what I really want is date, so you can scroll down through the list and see where you are in time... using the large data on demand rendering that it uses
[07:33:41] <seutje> Krambiorix: set the attribute on the DOM element, not on the jQuery collection
[07:33:55] <seutje> Krambiorix: or better yet: use proper event binding instead of this on-x nonsense :P
[07:34:45] <faraway_> Probeee: inserting a function ?
[07:35:00] <xec_> hehe.
[07:35:07] <xec_> i chuckled.
[07:35:12] <Krambiorix> seutje, that's what i tried first
[07:35:24] <seutje> so try harder!
[07:35:31] <Krambiorix> :p
[07:35:44] <seutje> miketaylr is here, all will be fine now!
[07:36:01] <PBDev> okay, here is what I have http://pastebin.com/89K7bzVv
[07:36:02] <Krambiorix> seutje, now i see where you got your name :p
[07:36:09] <frantz> Ok, here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/FrRHw/29/ I want to get those left/right arrows to preview the next slide with animate probably
[07:36:10] <Krambiorix> seutje, ->joke
[07:36:26] <seutje> oh sry
[07:36:28] * seutje laughs
[07:36:35] <frantz> not sure what i need to do to get them to show a little bit of the next/prev slide each time someone hovers over the arrow
[07:36:37] <christo_m> is it possible to change the pajinate options on the fly, i looked at the plugin documentation but wasnt able to determine if its possible
[07:39:00] <FinalAngel> how can I trigger an event inside an open popoup like $('window').trigger('some_thing') which will be catched inside the opening window
[07:39:38] <Krambiorix> seutje, http://pastebin.com/jMW4pr4n
[07:40:22] <Krambiorix> that's my present for you
[07:40:54] <Probeee> like if $('.show-thank-you').show(); 	FB.Canvas.scrollTo(0,0);
[07:41:13] <Probeee> ill insert fb canvast scroll inside show
[07:41:49] <smftre> I'm having problems with loading the CKEditor in a FancyBox, it appears to load it, but the ckeditor is not editable under Chrome. Anyone experienced this before?
[07:42:00] <smftre> I think it's to do with the DOM itself.
[07:42:45] <Probeee> ???
[07:46:31] <ideaprison> Hi all, im trying to stop the page from scroll while scroll on a divÂ http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/NgmEJ/8/Â bit of an odd demo but as you can see you can flip through the albums but i want to stop the page from scrolling when you do so, made a weird attempt already you can ignore that
[07:49:08] <AdamPDotty> I would take a look at event.preventDefault first
[07:49:17] <smftre> anybody? yes?
[07:49:37] <ideaprison> yeah Adam that wouldnt work on the div of course because its not really a scrollable div
[07:50:10] <ideaprison> or am i misunderstanding that
[07:51:00] <faraway_> smftre: do you make the element editable before opening with fancybox?
[07:51:18] <smftre> faraway_: well, it works under FF, just not Chrome..
[07:51:59] <faraway_> smftre: the question is still the same ;)
[07:52:15] <smftre> faraway_: let me paste some code for you to see
[07:55:14] <smftre> faraway_: http://pastebin.com/QRZhmY6G
[07:55:35] <smftre> When the user clicks the button to make it all happen ^ this is what is done.
[07:55:54] <smftre> It appears to work correctly under FF, but the ckeditor is not editable under Chrome
[07:57:44] <seutje> ideaprison: http://brandonaaron.net/code/mousewheel might be interesting
[07:57:48] <smftre> faraway_: any ideas?
[07:58:43] <seutje> ideaprison: actually, preventDefault is enough, no?
[07:59:06] <cromac> it will still catch the scroll but you may need to calculate the position of the mouse
[07:59:49] <cromac> if you just use preventDefault that will prevent the scroll on the whole page
[08:00:10] <jomofcw> Hello !
[08:00:29] <jomofcw> Can I have the pointer position out of an event (without using the mousemove event in fact) please ?
[08:01:11] <ideaprison> seutje, cromac: i used that before but didnt seem to work, but yes all i want is that scrolling on that div will not make the whole page scroll
[08:01:15] <smftre> faraway_: if I replace the "afterLoad:function" with "onComplete:function" then it performs the same in FF and Chrome, i.e. It loads but is not editable.
[08:01:53] <cromac> combination of this with sometthing that watches mouse position will do it
[08:02:09] <cromac> you can use the mousemove event to catch this
[08:02:26] <seutje> ideaprison: http://jsfiddle.net/NgmEJ/10/ works for me
[08:03:11] <FinalAngel> can't I call an event from inside a popup (window.open) to the parent window using $(window.opener).trigger('custom') ?
[08:04:05] <smftre> everything I try doesnt work in Chrome! this is bullshit!
[08:04:07] <jomofcw> cromac yup that's already what I've done. But when mouse doesn't move, when I create the element I want to be positionned, I should get the position of the pointer without the event mousemove
[08:04:30] <ideaprison> seutje: strange, i see that that now works, going to see how well it holds up in the full version. thanks
[08:05:53] <ideaprison> its working (phew) though i could have sworn i used it before but not important anymore now that it works
[08:06:16] <cromac> jomocfw: store the mouse position somewhere
[08:07:10] <cromac> afaik you cant get it without an event
[08:07:19] <faraway_> smftre: i would guess that fancybox is doning some node movement in the dom after the afterLoader, which doe snot work well with ckeditor
[08:07:20] <cromac> can't imagine how you would
[08:07:37] <abletony84> seutje: still there im working on adding and removing placeholders just to make this little search thing perfect
[08:07:47] <smftre> faraway_: so how can I make it work in Chrome? Any ideas at all would be wonderfuL :D
[08:07:47] <abletony84> http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/cgZ39/1/ any criticism etc.?
[08:08:36] <faraway_> smftre: could you wrap the content of the afterLoad into a setTimeout(function() { .... }, 1000); if it works then after a second on all browsers then i could be this problem
[08:08:38] <smftre> faraway_: I f___ing fixed it! Been siting with this for days now! I just implemented it and then set a timeout to wait and then destroy and reimplement  it !!
[08:08:40] <olliejudge> Hi Guys, having trouble with this file for a a/b test, I need the element called delivery options to slide out out from each offer, I don't think my click event is right. Any help appreciated: https://gist.github.com/40f8d03785b52633198c

[08:39:36] <phrearch> seutje: thanks!
[08:39:48] <phrearch> eval seems to work
[08:39:57] <seutje> but no :(
[08:40:10] <seutje> what have I done? q.q
[08:40:14] <fRAiLtY-> Can someone point in the right direction regarding this AJAX upload? You'll notice this test page, http://www.printpanoramics.co.uk/test.html, has a browse/upload button. Once you select an image it automatically begins the upload, then finishes displaying the filename etc. What specific function/area am I looking at within the script, http://pastie.org/5137859 so I can expand it to show a thumbnail/version of the image in a container div or similar?
[08:53:12] <Rukan> why does $($) hang both chrome and firefox?
[08:54:41] <brainwarped> anyone know of some code that will turn an option list into an accordion/tree?
[08:54:52] <vedic> I have a list of links that are created dynamically. When cursor moves on these links, links get highlighted with background color and border. I want to skip one of the links in this list of links on the page i.e. when cursor comes on that particular link it should not get focus or the cursor quickly moves to one link below it. How to do that?
[08:56:43] <brainwarped> I really like the jquery UI accordion widget, but I can't figure out how to apply it to an option list.
[08:57:08] <GeO`> I don't think you directly can
[08:57:29] <GeO`> you could loop into the select options, and populate some divs with them, and then use the accordion,
[08:59:01] <vedic> Basically I am using autocomplete plugin of jquery-ui. I want to skip one of the source items from the list of items in suggested. How to do that?
[08:59:33] <vedic> The list is something like:
[09:00:54] <vedic> 'New York'
[09:00:54] <vedic> 'Chicago'
[09:00:54] <vedic> '--------------------'
[09:00:54] <vedic> 'Outside US, World'
[09:00:54] <vedic> How to skip the line '----------------' from the autocomplete suggestions?
[09:01:48] <brainwarped> GeO`: You don't think that would mess with the options list too much? currently my code: return u'<option value="%s" data-tree-id="%s" data-left-value="%s"%s>%s</option>' % (... so I can just put a <div> prior to <option and the form would still work?
[09:02:09] <ajpiano> that definitely won't work
[09:02:26] <metallico> hi guys, i am in the same situation as this here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12078810/how-to-disable-touchswipe-plugin-in-cargocollective# how can i overwrite "wipeRight"?
[09:02:32] <metallico> that answer there doesnt make any sence
[09:02:33] <GeO`> my idea was to get rid of the <select>
[09:05:13] <brainwarped> GeO`: what if I wanted to be difficult and retain the select, would the form blow up?
[09:06:04] <vedic> How to disable an item from the list of items suggested by autocomplete ui plugin?
[09:06:23] <vedic> Disabled items should be visible but not allowed to select
[09:07:29] <GeO`> brainwarped when I loop in the options, I'd check if the current one is selected, and if it is I'd apply a specific class to the corresponding div in the accordion
[09:10:09] <brainwarped> GeO`: thats fairly difficult... but its worth a couple hours to make me happy.
[09:10:55] <GeO`> but once you created the accordion, I don't see how you could use it as a selector tho
[09:14:09] <brainwarped> GeO`: I want to use a django widget to contain the accordion: http://i.imgur.com/lUmKI.png
[09:14:21] <GeO`> k
[09:15:05] <brainwarped> GeO`: still a bad idea?
[09:15:46] <vedic> How to disable an item from the list of items suggested by autocomplete ui plugin?
[09:15:53] <vedic> Disabled items should be visible but not allowed to select
[09:20:09] <GeO`> I don't get how you'd include a jquery accordion there tbh
[09:20:36] <needlz_> Hi. Please don't shoot me for this newbie question, but I've been trying to integrate redactor.js (WYSIWYG editor on jQuery). One of the main problems is that I'd like to disable pasting of pre-formated text into the editor. This can be done by setting the allowedTags variable. Now my question: Can I just set that variable inside  document.ready() or do I need a special jQuery-paste listener for that?
[09:21:26] <Qdest> How do I access an object in js/jq? I've got 2 stored keys with 2 values, I'd like the one named "slide", e.g. this.options[slide] but, that doesn't work :p
[09:21:42] <vedic> How to get access to content part in 'ui' object as mentioned here. http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-response   I am interested in change the data response gets
[09:21:47] <Qdest> oh.. this.options['slide'] works
[09:22:04] <xec_> Qdest: or this.options.slide perhaps?
[09:22:23] <Qdest> yay :)
[09:23:47] <brainwarped> GeO`: Me too. I'll let you know when I figure it out:)
[09:24:33] <yannickoo> Hey guys, can you help me to fix the tabbing problem? I want be able to focus the other divs âÂ http://jsfiddle.net/zfxUD/
[09:28:35] <zfly9> Hello all, I have a site at http://zhlaw.six5webdesign.com/ and sort of a copy at http://67.225.219.106/ when I go to either one, the slider often doesn't appear, clicking on the logo or the home page link, it then works, any suggestions? This is driving me nuts
[09:28:49] <vinici> yannickoo doing tabindex -1 in a div, is only a workaround. what it mean? well, it means that this is not equals to div:focus css selector
[09:28:50] <vinici> :)
[09:28:58] <vinici> but probably the div is focused.
[09:29:38] <NoiseEee> vinici: a <div> has no focus event
[09:30:00] <vinici> NoiseEee yes, is what i'm saying to him :), doing tabindex -1 in a div
[09:30:06] <vinici> is only a workaround
[09:30:09] <vinici> to focus
[09:30:17] <NoiseEee> ahh :)
[09:30:34] <Saaether> zfly9: you have a syntax error some where, not sure if thats whats causing the issue
[09:30:59] <Qdest> xec_: ever seen http://jqueryboilerplate.com/ ?
[09:31:12] <Saaether> i see the issue
[09:31:36] <fission6> is there a straight forward way to ask a $.when how many of its child promises are resolved?
[09:31:48] <aqeel> hi room
[09:31:49] <fission6> i want to create a status / progress bar
[09:32:14] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/b2Aq3/
[09:33:03] <aqeel> so far so good...but that i want is after screen resolution changes it must show the alert once but here before closing window it alerts...
[09:33:42] <vinici> fission6 here: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=progress+bar+with+jquery
[09:34:04] <fission6> vinici: thats not my question
[09:34:12] <vinici> what do u want
[09:34:23] <xec_> Qdest: no, thanks for the link. looks interesting
[09:34:41] <Saaether> zfly9: look at the line that says "$( ".selector" ).accordion({ disabled: true });" you close off the accordion code there but then continue on as if its wrapping the code below it
[09:35:21] <Saaether> so either that shouldnt be closed there or you need to remove the extra closing tag a few lines down
[09:36:08] <zfly9> Saaether thanks I'll take a look
[09:37:04] <fission6> vinici: i want to know if there is a way to aska  $.when how many of its promises are resolved
[09:37:17] <ciack404> Hi everyone
[09:38:10] <aqeel> ok guys live sample here.....jailbreak.webege.com
[09:38:26] <ciack404> how do you redirect from a server to a jQuery mobile app? I need to go from app -> myServer -> Facebook -> myServer -> app
[09:38:32] <aqeel> click on detail or the explosion icon and then change your resolution
[09:39:26] <vinici> fission6 oh, now i got it :)
[09:39:35] <Cork> fission6: only way to do that would be to monkey patch jquery
[09:39:37] <vinici> well i don't know, but maybe there is a workaround
[09:39:43] <Cork> fission6: its an internal variable to .when
[09:39:44] <Qdest> xec_: I'm trying to find out why I can't use this.element.is('nav') or so, says Object #<HTMLElement> has no method 'is' - any suggestion? :D
[09:39:46] <vinici> .when method only have then and done methods
[09:40:08] <Cork> Qdest: your running it on the dom element you need to wrap it
[09:40:10] <camoka4> hi
[09:40:13] <Cork> $(this.element)
[09:40:42] <camoka4> can I make the animation in ensonhaber.com with jquery
[09:40:43] <camoka4> thank you
[09:41:01] <Qdest> facepalm
[09:41:04] <Qdest> Thanks :)
[09:41:09] <Cork> :)
[09:41:52] <aqeel> so how do i stop the alert that is happening on child window
[09:41:52] <CodesStuff> Aaaaand Cork is back for his daily tech support rituals.
[09:41:53] <CodesStuff> \o/
[09:42:13] <CodesStuff> aqeel: Does your domain own the child window?
[09:42:16] <camoka4> hi
[09:42:20] <camoka4> can anyone answer my questin
[09:42:21] <aqeel> yes
[09:42:23] <CodesStuff> If so, just overwrite window.alert
[09:42:24] <camoka4> question
[09:42:35] <CodesStuff> window.alert = function() { return false; }
[09:42:39] <aqeel> it is window.open and creted with in my page
[09:43:00] <Cork> camoka4: what is the question?
[09:43:02] <CodesStuff> aqeel: Why not just remove the alert?
[09:43:03] <aqeel> thanks...
[09:43:14] <Cork> window.open doens't matter
[09:43:22] <Cork> what domain the target is does
[09:43:22] <aqeel> well it must be there for first time and not again when chage happens
[09:43:38] <Cork> aqeel: what causes the alert?
[09:43:43] <CodesStuff> Cork: How many times daily do you explain the SOP?
[09:43:45] <zfly9> Saaether I think I took care of it, but still hapeneing
[09:43:48] <aqeel> change in screen resolution
[09:43:53] <Cork> CodesStuff: many :)
[09:44:06] <CodesStuff> ?sop
[09:44:07] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[09:44:13] <CodesStuff> ^^easier :P
[09:44:14] <Cork> aqeel: so, onresize?
[09:44:34] <aqeel> no not resize....screen resolution
[09:44:48] <Cork> aqeel: there is no resolution event
[09:45:02] <jedimind> aqeel, you're looking for media queries
[09:45:06] <camoka4> can I make the animation in ensonhaber.com with jquery
[09:45:12] <ciack404> anyone know  how to redirect from a server to a jQuery mobile app? I need to go from app -> myServer -> Facebook -> myServer -> app
[09:45:12] <jedimind> resolution doesnt have a tendency to change onc ea page has loaded
[09:45:25] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/b2Aq3/
[09:45:32] <Saaether> zfly9 hmm when i go to the site its loading the banner for me, you have a way to reproduce the issue?
[09:45:51] <aqeel> this works great....but i do not want the second alert again on child window...
[09:46:00] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[09:46:02] <Cork> camoka4: that's not one animation, which one?
[09:46:08] <Saaether> nvm got it to not work
[09:46:16] <aqeel> click detail or explosion icon and chage your resolution
[09:46:34] <aqeel> desktop resolution
[09:47:08] <zfly9> Saaether , sweet
[09:47:40] <Cork> aqeel: your markup is invalid
[09:47:57] <Cork> nothing should below the body tag
[09:48:24] <CodesStuff> ciack404: Are you asking how to authenticate with Facebook's API?
[09:48:40] <CodesStuff> Moreover, are you using Facebook Connect or Open Graph for authentication?
[09:48:40] <aqeel> huh???
[09:48:44] <Cork> ugg
[09:49:01] <CodesStuff> Also this is #jquery not #facebook :P
[09:49:02] <Cork> aqeel: your checking the height/width of the screen every 50 ms
[09:49:12] <CodesStuff> Cork: LOLWUT
[09:49:20] <Cork> thats.... wasteful...
[09:49:25] <CodesStuff> dat cpu
[09:49:29] <Cork> CodesStuff: setInterval(function () {if (screen.width !== width || screen.height !== height) {width = screen.width; height = screen.height; $(window).trigger('resolutionchange');}}, 50);
[09:49:29] <zfly9> Saaether, btw I've only made changes on the first link
[09:49:36] <CodesStuff> :|
[09:49:38] <Saaether> zfly9 i saw
[09:49:50] <Saaether> seems like a very random issue =/
[09:49:57] <ciack404> @CodesStuff no I can do that. My problem is that once I'm logged I go on my server and then I don't know how to return to my app
[09:50:09] <aqeel> i agree but it is for the sake of resolution chages...
[09:50:26] <CodesStuff> ciack404: Facebook has a redirectURI parameter after authentication
[09:50:33] <Cork> aqeel: base it on the size of the browser window instead
[09:50:54] <Cork> aqeel: then you get a resize event every time the resolution is changed
[09:51:01] <CodesStuff> ciack404: Is PHP's header("Location: http://...yourapp/"); out of the question?
[09:51:03] <Cork> no timer needed
[09:51:20] <CodesStuff> Gotta love JS events
[09:51:33] <ciack404> CodesStuff yes and I use it to go to my server. But at that point I need to close that "dialog"
[09:51:39] <camoka4> Cork
[09:51:44] <camoka4> the animation big one
[09:51:48] <camoka4> 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8..
[09:51:52] <CodesStuff> ciack404: Is your app 100% JS-based?
[09:51:54] <camoka4> the main in front page
[09:52:06] <Cork> camoka4: you mean the image slider?
[09:52:13] <ciack404> CodesStuff my app is jq mobile wrapped with phonegap build
[09:52:15] <camoka4> yes yes
[09:52:24] <Cork> camoka4: sure, there might even be a plugin out there for it
[09:52:29] <ciack404> CodesStuff and the server is in python
[09:52:33] <camoka4> jquery?
[09:52:35] <camoka4> ok
[09:53:03] <CodesStuff> Because FB.connect() has a nice little auth event class, ciack404. Wait... is your application actually on their phones? Or is it shown with a webView
[09:53:25] <CodesStuff> (I've never used Phonegap so I'm not 100% sure how you've setup your stack)
[09:53:36] <ciack404> CodesStuff phones (both iOS ans android)
[09:53:49] <Cork> camoka4: actually that page is jquery already
[09:53:52] <Cork> :)
[09:53:57] <Cork> so ya, its doable
[09:54:00] <Cork> ;P
[09:54:00] <CodesStuff> Hmm.. in that case ciack404 you might need to make a custom URI schema to target it.
[09:54:09] <CodesStuff> Instagram has something like instagram://edit_profile/
[09:54:11] <zfly9> Saaether , nooooo
[09:54:17] <Cork> anyway i'm off
[09:54:40] <CodesStuff> You should be able to delegate the webview/dialog popup to navigate back to your application
[09:55:00] <CodesStuff> Regardless ciack404, I think your question may be better suited for #phonegap
[09:55:09] <CodesStuff> cya cork o/
[09:55:48] <ciack404> CodesStuff oh, I don't know about custom uri schema. A quick search on google sent me on iPhone pages and I need both that and android
[09:56:00] <ciack404> CodesStuff ok thanks for the help and tips :)
[09:56:11] <aqeel> thanks and bye cork
[09:56:50] <Qdest> CodesStuff: Could you tell me how I can access this.options within the .on() inside the prototype?
[09:56:55] <Qdest> http://jsfiddle.net/aakBx/
[09:57:37] <Qdest> Not entirely sure I'm going about this the right way but basically I'd like to fetch the options and do stuff based on them
[09:59:47] <Saaether> zfly9 honestly i cant figure out why it works some times and not others
[09:59:53] <aqeel> cork if i base it on resize wouldn't that be effected if i just chage my browser window size in the same resolution
[10:00:59] <zfly9> Saaether well thanks for checking..
[10:01:12] <Saaether> it looks like the carousel just isnt loading but there arent any errors
[10:01:48] <aqeel> u see if i keep changing the screen size i will get the alert but with screen resolution i get everytime once the resolution only changes
[10:08:11] <vedic> How to disable an item from the list of items suggested by autocomplete ui plugin?
[10:08:15] <vedic> Disabled items should be visible but not allowed to select
[10:09:20] <vedic> 'New York'
[10:09:21] <vedic> 'Chicago'
[10:09:21] <vedic> 'California'
[10:09:21] <vedic> '--------------------'
[10:09:21] <vedic> 'Outside USA, World'
[10:09:21] <vedic> How to skip the line '----------------' from the autocomplete suggestions?
[10:09:44] <vedic> with skip I mean disable from selection
[10:10:31] <ancafe> Hi.
[10:10:38] <Saaether> when you generate the '-----' line add disabled="disabled" to it?
[10:12:23] <Qdest> I have var one = 'text'; and I'd like to insert that in a call to $.fn.one but one being text and not one. How?
[10:13:23] <ancafe> I've a dude. I modified the inputs of a form to receive focus appears a calculator. Moreover dynamically generated new inputs with JQuery, but I can not make these new inputs to the calculator display focusable. How I can make inputs dynamically generated code will affect the document.ready ()?
[10:13:31] <vedic> Saaether: I am just adding '-----' to an array of cities and passing this array to the autocomplete plugin. Autocomplete then dynamically creates the dropdown using <li class='ui-menuitems'><a id='ui-active-menuitem>------</a></li>
[10:13:45] <Qdest> $.fn.+one doesn't work, $.fn.(one) doesn't work, $.fn.+(one) etc, dunno how to do it. basically I want to check if a certain method exists (jQ UI easing)
[10:15:29] <vedic> Saaether: Is it possible to detect when the cursor moves on '-----', if yes then I think 'a' and its parent 'li' both can be disabled
[10:15:59] <NoiseEee> vedic: you want the disabled at the time of list generation / immediately after
[10:16:23] <vedic> NoiseEee: yea, but how to do that?
[10:16:34] <NoiseEee> vedic: or add a class to those items that signifies they should not be selectable
[10:17:12] <NoiseEee> vedic: and use CSS to grey them out etc... and if that class is present on the item the user selects, let them know its not cool
[10:17:13] <vedic> NoiseEee: I am using ui autocomplete plugin. This dropdown list is automatically created. I just supply an array of items
[10:17:40] <NoiseEee> vedic: you have all sorts of control
[10:17:54] <Qdest> I was looking for hasOwnProperty()
[10:18:03] <vedic> NoiseEee: Could you give some direction how to do that? any example
[10:21:47] <abletony84> at this calculate and set column width thingie at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/yCEJs/2/ - is there a way not to show "var widest_odd" and "var widest_even" at the top there?
[10:23:05] <NoiseEee> vedic: iirc basically you want to overwrite/alter the default _renderItem and/or _renderMenu methods...
[10:24:03] <NoiseEee> using $.widget
[10:24:24] <NoiseEee> vedic: been a while, try this SO http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2435964/jqueryui-how-can-i-custom-format-the-autocomplete-plug-in-results

[10:39:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hey... anyone experience with uploadifive (the html5 version) - need urgent help
[10:40:05] <NoiseEee> ancafe: either add them after the field is added, or use .on() and event delegation to 'watch' for those fields/classes
[10:41:26] <fission6> how would i call a notify() from inside an ajax done or pipe? i want to alert the when() that one of its chilren is done and update a progress bar
[10:42:45] <zfly9> lz?
[10:43:30] <lz> zfly9, I don't think it has to do with how your js is loaded
[10:44:20] <lz> zfly9, it works fine in safari
[10:44:24] <lz> on the first try
[10:44:40] <zfly9> yeah try a few hard refreshes
[10:44:40] <lz> nvm, it just stopped

[11:06:15] <bot-t> hateIE, .fadeToggle() - Display or hide the matched elements by animating their opacity. http://api.jquery.com/fadeToggle/
[11:08:31] <hateIE> no i want to show my loading screen straight away as soon as the user clicks.. but i want the browser to wait till its actually completed .load() before it shows the content rather then loading it as it goes sort of thing
[11:08:57] <hateIE> so the loading screen stays till the bitter end :D
[11:09:33] <hateIE> then wham contents updated!
[11:10:51] <hateIE> is that even possible?
[11:11:52] <brainwarped> GeO`: don't know what I was thinking... you can't use an accordion to view a tree... you need a tree widget.
[11:12:07] <pedda> hi there
[11:12:52] <brainwarped> does jquery have a tree widget?
[11:13:44] <hateIE> cant I do something like blob=loadhtml('page.html); then in a completion function $("#content").html(blob);
[11:14:26] <pedda> i have an accordion and if i hit the accordion header my page reloads,what do i need to do, to prevent this behaviour ?
[11:15:52] <fission6> how do you get a promise to bubble a notification to a parent promise
[11:16:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm having this input event handler: http://pastebin.com/BCYVMhje - at some spot I do this.id.split('_')[2] - but firebug says this.id is undefined... why does it not know the element?
[11:16:19] <hateIE> aha
[11:16:22] <hateIE> $.get
[11:21:25] <minijupe> I have the following selected in a form: <option value="2">Supporting Organization</option>   $('#select').val() yields '2'. How do I get 'Supporting Organization'?
[11:31:41] <hateIE> whats the crack.. Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'fadeToggle'
[11:31:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm having this input event handler: http://pastebin.com/BCYVMhje - at some spot I do this.id.split('_')[2] - but firebug says this.id is undefined... why does it not know the element?
[11:38:18] <someprimetime> groooooooove street!
[11:38:39] * hlve slaps someprimetime around a bit with a large trout
[11:38:55] <someprimetime> oh really?
[11:39:25] <abletony84> At this slide-open-on-hover search box: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/pDLN5/23/ how do I hide the placeholder initially? And why does it stop working after the first run?
[11:39:29] <abletony84> These problems aren't in the original version: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/pDLN5/2/ - but in the original version, the placeholder disappears too late.
[11:41:40] <hateIE> where has fadeToggle gone?
[11:43:33] <Saaether> hateIE hasnt gone any where
[11:44:11] <Saaether> you're most likely trying to toggle an object that isnt toggleable
[11:44:32] <hateIE> so its not for block elements then?
[11:46:22] <jgomez> I'm looking for help with the Awkward Showcase jquery plugin. I want to call it's "changeContent" method when I click an item - but I don't know how to access it.
[11:48:17] <hlve> $("#other").click(function() {   changeContent(); });
[11:48:23] <Saaether> hateIE, works fine for block elements
[11:48:26] <hlve> o_O
[11:48:39] <hlve> jgomez: ^^
[11:49:08] <jgomez> hlve: Thanks - I'll give it a try :-)
[11:49:53] <Pnoexz> !help
[11:49:53] <b-ot> Pnoexz, NO U!
[11:50:01] <hlve> lol
[11:53:43] <jgomez> hlve: No joy :-( Still getting changeContent is not defined. Basically the changeContent method is in jquery.aw-showcase.js, , and then $("#showcase").awShowcase() is called on document ready
[11:54:01] <hlve> can you jsfiddle it?
[11:54:08] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/
[11:54:24] <jgomez> hlve: So I thought $("#showcase") would have the methods to access.
[11:56:01] <hlve> why not look at the source code for awkward showcase?
[11:56:03] <hlve> jgomez ^
[11:56:31] <jgomez> hlve: Just taking a look at jfiddle
[11:56:35] <hlve> kk
[11:56:50] <hlve> jgomez, it's really simple if you just look at the source code on their demo page lol
[11:56:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> So when I do console.log(this) - firebugs tells me that it's an object like this: [input#file_upload_10]
[11:57:00] <jgomez> hlve: I have been, that's how I know about the changeContent method
[11:57:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what I need is the 10 value from that... Any way to get it? this.id is undefined
[11:57:19] <Pnoexz> when will people learn to ask smart questions?
[11:57:22] <Pnoexz> *sigh*
[11:57:38] <hlve> what exactly are you trying to do with it?
[11:57:54] <hlve> changeContent
[11:57:54] <hlve> one sec
[11:58:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm having this input event handler: http://pastebin.com/BCYVMhje - at some spot I do this.id.split('_')[2] - but firebug says this.id is undefined...
[11:58:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Pnoexz: talking to me?
[11:58:44] <Pnoexz> ecky--ptang-zoob: not particularly, havent read your question
[11:58:44] <jgomez> hlve: But what I want is something slightly different. I want "buttons" that I have set in the HTML
[11:58:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ah ok
[11:58:57] <jgomez> hlve: and for the content to change when I click on the them
[11:59:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> mind reading it? :p
[11:59:22] <hlve> jgomez, I'll do it as soon as I'm out of this stupid meeting
[11:59:23] <hlve> lol
[11:59:33] <hlve> Mind making a quick mockup on jsfiddle for me? and I'll take care of ya
[11:59:35] <jgomez> hlve: :-) Thanks
[12:00:03] <jgomez> hlve :I don't know how to include the showcase jquery there...
[12:00:46] <Pnoexz> ecky--ptang-zoob: when you use this.id, you are using it in the object you are just creating context (the one you set as the uploadfive() parameter), not the HTML element
[12:01:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, but how would I retrieve the id of the element that triggered the event?
[12:01:29] <kraftb> hello !
[12:01:34] <Pnoexz> the whole part between {} is a new object you are creating
[12:01:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> do i need to use proxy?
[12:01:38] <kraftb> is there some jquery method which does base64_decode?
[12:01:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Pnoexz: ok, I get that... so it's a scope thing
[12:02:00] <Pnoexz> ecky--ptang-zoob: what is uploadifive()?
[12:02:05] <Pnoexz> yessir
[12:02:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it's a multi file uploader, html5 and jquer
[12:02:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> works great
[12:02:33] <Pnoexz> (fyi, i have not read your original question)
[12:02:42] <Pnoexz> is it a plugin or what?
[12:02:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no...
[12:02:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://www.uploadify.com/download/download-uploadifive-standard/
[12:03:16] <Pnoexz> im not gonna download that
[12:03:21] <hlve> kraft, why do you ask?
[12:03:27] <hlve> Javascript does base64_decode
[12:03:34] <hlve> and typically it's seen in website viruses
[12:03:34] <hlve> lol
[12:03:40] <Pnoexz> why do you care why he asks for? lol
[12:03:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok, but how do I get the id of the element that triggered the event?
[12:03:53] <hlve> because it might be being used for malicious things
[12:03:53] <hlve> ol
[12:04:01] <Pnoexz> ecky--ptang-zoob: pass it as a parameter to the function
[12:04:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> to what function?
[12:04:25] <Pnoexz> uploadifive
[12:04:36] <Pnoexz> if you can
[12:04:41] <devslash> if i want to add a jquery element to a jquery tab ui to i use .append() ?
[12:05:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have no idea how that would be possible in this context: http://pastebin.com/WjYb5T0B
[12:05:27] <Pnoexz> if not, you can do something like.. var element = $("input[id^=file_upload]");element.uploadifive({foobarbaz, uploadfolder: foo + element.id
[12:05:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> see where I do: this.id.split('_')[2] - this.is is the object you referred to
[12:05:48] <Pnoexz> well, i dont know how uploadifive() works, so i cant help much
[12:06:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but it's just a scope thing... can't be that hard
[12:06:44] <devslash> anyone know ?
[12:06:59] <Pnoexz> devslash: i dont see why not
[12:07:59] <devslash> its not working. once i add it using append, the controls' css gets messed up and does respond to click
[12:08:27] <devslash> doesnt
[12:08:46] <Pnoexz> devslash: show me the code
[12:09:41] <Pnoexz> devslash: dont PM without permission on IRC.. its an (un)written rule
[12:10:01] <devslash> can i pm you the link to the javascript code ?
[12:10:15] <Pnoexz> i dont particularly mind, but people here will rightfully give you sheeit about it
[12:10:18] <Pnoexz> and yes, you can
[12:10:24] <Pnoexz> here = freenode
[12:10:24] <devslash> ok thanks
[12:11:45] <joshsmith> does anyone know of a way to get a file from the FileReader API and add it to an <input type="file">
[12:12:09] <joshsmith> or failing that, how to get at the file data to upload it via AJAX
[12:13:34] <NodeX> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOtOVe8aykk
[12:13:40] <G________> .
[12:17:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Pnoexz: found a way )
[12:20:28] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/FileReader / https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications @ joshsmith
[12:32:23] <obtofox> digging through the source of jquery, i saw that it uses an init helper class for instantiation instead of detecting if this == window like in jquery 1.1. is there a benefit to doing it this way?
[12:34:38] <joshsmith> NoiseEee: I've been looking at that, but it looks like it only has sendAsBinary as a possibility
[12:34:53] <joshsmith> no dynamically changing file inputs
[12:34:57] <joshsmith> am I right?
[12:35:52] <NoiseEee> joshsmith: probably, otherwise i'd sure love to grab c:\windows\secret.file or /etc/passwd from you
[12:36:55] <joshsmith> I guess I just don't understand how FileReader works enough to get why a user initiated event isn't the same thing as doing "Choose file"

[12:38:16] <jedimind> MOAR CODE
[12:38:17] <ajpiano> holy shit
[12:38:30] <jedimind> he's probably got an auto-join
[12:38:33] <jedimind> and its all buffered
[12:38:37] <Woet> that would execute after his paste though jedimind
[12:38:43] <ajpiano> yeah, i pmed saying i had to kick to stop the flood nad he can come back
[12:38:53] <devslash> has anyone here used jquery tabs ui ?
[12:38:53] <ajpiano> but a flood like that ideally should um... be stopped
[12:39:31] <danheberden> i'm surprised freenode allows that
[12:39:48] <ajpiano> it has to be a lot faster/floodier for their auto stuff to pick it up, i think
[12:40:08] <NoiseEee> its busy dealing with the flood from the hurricane
[12:40:12] <danheberden> like hurricane sandy faster/floddier?
[12:40:16] <danheberden> heh
[12:42:18] <grafi> could someone look at http://pastebin.com/rrfF7yWZ and tell me if there is a smart/short way to access the ajax response data for cases where I have 1 request and 2 requests?
[12:43:20] <devslash> has anyone here used jquery tabs ui ?
[12:58:55] <BlaDe^> hi guys... I have a P object from the google maps API, i'm passing it to a panTo functino which says : ncaught TypeError: Object 37.5549479,-122.2710601 has no method 'lng'
[12:59:19] <BlaDe^> However, if I console.log the P object I see __proto__ : P { lat: function () { } and lng: function () { } }
[12:59:32] <BlaDe^> why isn't panTo able to call those functions?
[13:01:36] <sokie> http://www.threadgills.tv/hd/#
[13:01:59] <sokie> sorry about that - wrong window
[13:10:11] <freeed> Hey guys.. is var img = new Image(); $(img)â¦  the same as just doing $('<img>') ?
[13:11:03] <danheberden> freeed: aye, close enough
[13:11:08] <danheberden> creates an image element
[13:11:16] <freeed> k, thanks danheberden
[13:17:56] <PilotBob> In an event handler given an element, how can I determine if it is a direct descent of another element?
[13:18:47] <PilotBob> I know I can use $("#myname > li") to get all the direct descenents... but given that li, how do I know if it is a direct child of the #myname ul?
[13:19:36] <fission6> anyone familar with how progress callbacks work? look slike it forms an array of notifications?
[13:19:37] <MistuhKurtz> PilotBob,  direct child == direct descendant
[13:19:42] <MistuhKurtz> also, what do you fly? :D
[13:20:06] <x0rcist> Hey guys; I have a nivoslider that I need two seperate javascript files called and working independently
[13:20:13] <x0rcist> Hey guys; I have a nivoslider that I need two seperate javascript files called and working independently/
[13:20:41] <NoiseEee> PilotBob: is that what you're interested in? only li's within #myname ul?
[13:20:51] <TelFiRE> what's the question x0rcist
[13:21:14] <PilotBob> NoiseEee: no... I have the li, I want to check if it is a direct descendant of the #myname element.
[13:21:19] <x0rcist> I have two seperate jquery.nivo.slider.pack.js files that each have different HTML output and I needed to modify the output of each
[13:21:35] <x0rcist> So I need to create two instances that won't interact with one another on the site
[13:21:46] <PilotBob> MistuhKurtz: Cessna 152/172... but haven't flown in years. Too expensive for me.
[13:21:49] <MistuhKurtz> PilotBob,  if $(this.parentNode) == $("#myname")
[13:21:59] <x0rcist> I am thinking I have to change the function name that its calling in the HTML and in the javascript itself in the file
[13:22:01] <MistuhKurtz> I think that should work.
[13:22:09] <MistuhKurtz> or
[13:22:24] <MistuhKurtz> if $(this.parentNode).attr('id') == 'myname'
[13:22:28] <MistuhKurtz> i know for sure that will work.
[13:23:24] <x0rcist> question make sense?
[13:24:52] <steveoh> hey
[13:25:07] <steveoh> i'm trying to unit test some jquery + vanilla js with jasmine
[13:25:24] <steveoh> and i pass a $(form) node into one of the methods to be tested
[13:25:42] <steveoh> how can mock that or fake that so i can write good unit tests
[13:26:04] <fission6> why does progress queue up the notification like it does
[13:26:44] <PilotBob> MistuhKurtz: yes, that works. Thanks.
[13:27:59] <x0rcist> Can I include a file once, have it execute, then call another and execute?
[13:28:11] <TelFiRE> x0rcist: I see. Well I am not too familiar with nivo particularly, but I'm hoping/assuming it doesn't define any global functions or variables. In which case you could just change the filename, and the name of the function that everything's wrapped in
[13:28:12] <PilotBob> ok... not quite jquery... what I need to do is hide an element on mouseenter of another then show on mouse out. But, I want to delay the show for a few seconds... however, if they mouse enter again and then the setTimeout fires it will hide. Can you cancel a setTimeout somehow?
[13:29:48] <camoka4> how can I create a jquery animation
[13:29:49] <camoka4> ?
[13:29:50] <camoka4> thank you.
[13:30:23] <NoiseEee> camoka4: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery#Animate_me:_Using_Effects
[13:30:48] <camoka4> NoiseEee: I have seen that before. doesn't mean anythign to me
[13:30:52] <NoiseEee> camoka4: http://blog.kevinchisholm.com/jquery/jquery-animate-introduction/
[13:30:56] <NoiseEee> camoka4: so what are you asking for?
[13:31:16] <NoiseEee> camoka4: you'll need to learn javascript/jquery
[13:31:26] <camoka4> first. I want to create the animation of jquery. then my question is how to put it into Drupal
[13:31:55] <NoiseEee> camoka4: your questions don't really mean anything.
[13:32:08] <NoiseEee> camoka4: what does "create the animation of jquery" mean?
[13:32:14] <camoka4> ok I have a Drupal website alright?
[13:32:24] <camoka4> I want to build a similar animation on the website ensonhaber.com
[13:32:36] <camoka4> 1-2-3-4-5-6-
[13:32:46] <camoka4> what should I do
[13:34:04] <NoiseEee> you should take the time to learn javascript, and jquery
[13:34:15] <NoiseEee> camoka4: doing anything requires you coding something
[13:34:31] <camoka4> those codes will be put to blocks in Drupal?
[13:34:46] <camoka4> create block ?
[13:35:03] <NoiseEee> camoka4: presumably Drupal has a way to integrate javascript and jquery. http://drupal.org/node/171213
[13:35:03] <ryanneufeld> camoka4: it sounds like you don't know what you're doing. Learn drupal first
[13:35:12] <ryanneufeld> then learn javascript
[13:35:51] <camoka4> it would be nice if there was an example
[13:36:24] <fission6> any ideas?
[13:37:41] <NoiseEee> camoka4: http://drupal.org/documentation/understand and #drupal no doubt
[13:37:45] <camoka4> I need to understand the principles to learn it
[13:39:12] <draginx> http://jsfiddle.net/jJNmV/ any idea why flot will *not* plot my data sets correctly on the day?
[13:39:16] <draginx> or at least show all of the days
[13:41:13] <vatzec> Why does this work: slides.first().css(someCss); and why does this not work: slides[0].css(someCss)? var slides = $('#slideshow > *');
[13:43:36] <bartmax> vatzec: first return a jq object, last the dom element.
[13:44:03] <vatzec> bartmax: Is there any way I can rewrite the definition of slides so that the latter would work?
[13:44:17] <bartmax> vatzec: yes.. dont remember if its get.. hold on
[13:44:18] <bartmax> ? get
[13:44:18] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[13:44:23] <bartmax> nope :)
[13:44:26] <bartmax> ? index
[13:44:26] <bot-t> .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[13:44:38] <bartmax> i think index is the way to go
[13:44:44] <bartmax> something like slides.index(0).css(someCss)
[13:44:47] <bartmax> try it out
[13:44:47] <vatzec> Isn't .get() what I want? Hold up, I'll give it a try.
[13:44:57] <bartmax> no, get() returns the DOM elements.
[13:45:01] <bartmax> DOM != jQuery Object
[13:45:24] <vatzec> Which one can I reference with array indices?
[13:46:19] <vatzec> In other words, what I'm trying to do is to make the slides[0].css(someCss) line work without modifying any bit of it.
[13:46:52] <ajpiano> you have to use slides.eq(0).css(...)
[13:47:32] <vatzec> Oh, so there's no way to use array indices? Man. I guess I'll stick to first() then. It seems to be the most self-explanatory.
[13:48:28] <ajpiano> first is a shortcut to eq(0)
[13:49:49] <someprimetime> ajpianooooooooooooooooo
[13:50:16] <therbg> i've a really silly question
[13:50:43] <someprimetime> vatzec: with plain old javascript you can use an index if you want
[13:51:01] <someprimetime> document.getElementsByTagName('input')[0]
[13:51:04] <ajpiano> you can also do ... $( slides[0] ).css(....)
[13:51:15] <someprimetime> and that
[13:51:21] <ajpiano> but like.... it's up to .  "using array subscripting" shouldn't be your paramount goal
[13:51:48] <vatzec> Oh, that's nice to know. :)
[13:51:49] <nicholasschulz> when i use $(window).height(); i get a greater value than the actual windowâ¦ how come?
[13:51:50] <freeed> if I want to walk though a chain of elements, using .find() or .filter() is there a method to go back to the initially selected elements? Similar to .parent() but all the way back up the chain..
[13:51:52] <draginx> http://jsfiddle.net/jJNmV/ any idea why flot will *not* plot my data sets correctly on the day? or at least show all of the days?
[13:52:15] <tw2113> nicholasschulz, my guess is that it probably grabs padding/margin values too
[13:52:47] <nicholasschulz> tw2113, is there an easy fix or work around?
[13:52:50] <freeed> nicholasschulz, check out .outerHeight()
[13:53:55] * tw2113 is always happy to be wrong in these matters, strangely enough
[13:54:23] <bung> nowadays, do we just want to be binding everything with $(document).on(event,'#myTable td'),function(){...}); instead of the old $('#myTable td').event(function(){}); even with "event" simple like click/hover ?
[13:55:50] <bung> i know click is just an alias for .on() but then the question is whats better to bind to
[13:56:08] <bung> or ..click can be* an alias for .on()..
[13:56:36] <ajpiano> bung:  it make sense to bind to the lowest point in the dom that will be persistent
[13:56:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How is it called when you group data together in { '' : '', '' : ''}
[13:56:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> in jquery context...
[13:56:53] <freeed> ecky--ptang-zoob, that's an object
[13:57:02] <ajpiano> for instance, $("#mytable").on("click", "td", function(e) { }) might actually be the best choie for you
[13:57:05] <ajpiano> in that particular situation
[13:57:13] <nicholasschulz> i can't get it to workâ¦â¦â¦. so confusing. check it out: http://bannaky.com/webshop/ click any purse
[13:57:22] <bung> ajpiano: lowest point being a specific dom element (assuming its persistant) or 'document'
[13:57:27] <bung> sorry not sure whats low/high
[13:57:32] <ajpiano> bung: specific element
[13:57:37] <ajpiano> document is as "high" as you can go
[13:57:40] <bung> i see
[13:57:53] <bung> is that something i can read about somewhere
[13:57:58] <bung> how do you know that and why is it that way
[13:58:00] <bung> what could i google
[13:58:41] <falooda> Hello
[13:58:46] <bartmax> freeed: .end()
[13:59:05] <freeed>  brilliant bartmax!
[13:59:36] <freeed> bung, there is no why when it comes to what ajpiano knows :D
[14:00:00] <freeed> ..or how
[14:00:05] <falooda> what is the easiest way to implement a multi-valued autocomplete? what I mean is, say I am typing some value, I want to display related information in the select bar.
[14:00:09] <bartmax> ajpiano: knows everything.
[14:00:24] <bartmax> bung: just let him bless you
[14:00:26] <ajpiano> that is decidedly untrue :p
[14:00:30] <falooda> for example, if my autocomplete is providing a list of products, I also want to show the product ids in the drop down
[14:00:52] <falooda> in this format, "product name (product id)"
[14:01:07] <bung> lol
[14:01:16] <falooda> oh. dumb question i think
[14:01:24] <bartmax> falooda: so your server can return that, or on the display method you can do the name + '( ' id + ' )' thing
[14:01:31] <bartmax> falooda: kinda :D
[14:02:02] <falooda> bartmax, thanks, just realised that when I pressed enter :P
[14:02:09] <bartmax> ajpiano: anythink closer to come to Uruguay? it's going to be summer in short.
[14:03:45] <bung> ajpiano: would that possibly be so that if you needed to add more behaviour, you could bind onto the bubble somewhere a long the way
[14:04:07] <bung> whereas if you do the most basic things on (document) you're limiting yourself?
[14:05:19] <ajpiano> bung: it's mostly so that you don't have to "wait" for the event to bubble all the way to the document if you don't need it to
[14:05:33] <bung> i see, performance issues
[14:17:03] <TelFiRE> Hey all, anyone know a good snippet for making my own "slidetoggle" function but with animating the width instead of height?
[14:17:38] <TelFiRE> oooh you can put toggle as a width value? that might work...
[14:19:15] <draginx> http://jsfiddle.net/jJNmV/ any idea why flot will *not* plot my data sets correctly on the day? or at least show all of the days?

[14:50:42] <bil`> I have a method which fetches some ajax data and iterates over it to build an HTML element and then returns that html as a string. I then want to be able to call that method to inject that string in a few jQ methods like html() or append()
[14:51:12] <bil`> However, I'm having trouble getting the method to return the string because of the way it executes https://gist.github.com/42f05c37b28b51bccc4f
[14:51:54] <teinacher> Hi together. I got following problem: I am setting some html using the html(...) function. After that I am trying to use one of the elements set within this html(...) call using $('#elementID'). Unfortunately, the element does not always exist yet when running $('#elementID'). I know that html(...) is synchronous, Does anyone know a way to verify whether all of the content has been loaded already?
[14:52:46] <bil`> my bad that gist was messed up https://gist.github.com/42f05c37b28b51bccc4f
[14:54:17] <bil`> teinacher: why don't you just test for it
[14:54:23] <jacobroufa_> ping gnarf you around man?
[14:54:30] <jacobroufa_> by chance at the office?
[14:54:48] <bil`> like if ( $(element) != [] ) or soemthing
[14:55:54] <ajpiano> bil`: you have to execute the function, not reference it
[14:56:05] <ajpiano> .html( templates.inputSurveyList() );
[14:56:39] <teinacher> I am using backbone aura. So I am loading a parent module which loads some html. This html contains tags for modules which will be loaded afterwards. The definition of where a module has to be loaded to is externally, and not defined within the module. So I cannot check for the element id within the module, since I dont know it there.
[14:56:48] <teinacher> bil`
[14:57:55] <bil`> ajpiano:  that was a typo.. my bad. My issue more specifically is line 11 in the callback function doesn't get set in time
[14:58:10] <ajpiano> ohh
[14:58:15] <bil`> I'm not how to structure it different
[14:58:21] <bil`> im not sure*
[14:58:32] <ajpiano> you have to use deferreds or something.. you have to in someway acknowledge the fact that the fetch is async
[14:58:45] <teinacher> bil`: In case I would check for it / wait for it, I would do that using wait until loop? Or what is your suggestion?
[14:59:11] <bil`> ajpiano: any suggested reading? Never done that before
[14:59:29] <steveoh> if i have a $(form)
[14:59:42] <Heather_> anyone here got experience with nailthumb?
[14:59:43] <steveoh> can i use teh form to set input values or do i need to use a selector to find them
[14:59:49] <bil`> teinacher: Not sure. sound a bit above my knowledge
[14:59:58] <teinacher> okok, thanks anyways
[15:00:05] <ajpiano> bil`: http://danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/ http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[15:00:32] <steveoh> i see in the docs that form has a .val
[15:00:34] <ajpiano> bil`: so yeah, read that, watch that talk, etc... you'll have to reengineer your code to ackowledge that the thing is async
[15:00:54] <ajpiano> but also, calling something a "template" when it actually does an async fetch and can't be used immediately seems like misleading nomenclature
[15:01:07] <bil`> :)
[15:01:33] <steveoh> is what i'm after a possibility
[15:01:35] <steveoh> ?
[15:01:36] <bil`> the template object mostly contains static properties that are just strings of html
[15:01:53] <bil`> just a few are fetched and it seems like its the best way to organize it.. not sure
[15:02:07] <bil`> i should prob just use a tempting library
[15:02:26] <ajpiano> bil`: are they gonna be different every time the template is invoked?
[15:02:29] <ajpiano> bil`: yeah, that would help
[15:02:41] <ajpiano> would enforce the structure... then you could do the api call, then pass the data to the template when it's done
[15:03:10] <ajpiano> instead of trying to have a template function with a layer of async, when  all you want is a string of html synchronously
[15:05:34] <bil`> cool thanks man

[15:57:08] <grafi> :P
[15:57:15] <abletony94> ooh nice!
[15:57:33] <abletony94> blur awesome so thats how
[15:58:02] <steveoh> if i have var form = $('<form><input name/id='something'/></form>') how can i set the somethings input value from the form object?
[16:01:12] <steveoh> using form.val( ) doesn't seem to work
[16:01:25] <vjt> steveoh: you have to use .val() on the input, not on the form
[16:01:39] <vjt> steveoh: so, form.find('#foo').val('bar')
[16:01:46] <steveoh> so you have to use a selector
[16:01:57] <vjt> steveoh: if your input is name="foobar", you'd use form.find('[name=foobar]').val('barbaz')
[16:02:07] <steveoh> i thought if you had the form you could get away with not using a selector
[16:02:18] <steveoh> since forms are aware of their inputs
[16:02:27] <vjt> steveoh: well, what about you having multiple inputs in the form? which input should .val() set?
[16:02:30] <vjt> :)
[16:02:39] <steveoh> form.val('id', value)
[16:02:44] <steveoh> or soemthing
[16:03:13] <vjt> not so pretty, imho :)
[16:03:21] <steveoh> seems trivial
[16:03:23] <vjt> selectors are for selecting elements, .val() is for setting the value
[16:03:29] <vjt> yep, but it's not a good design
[16:03:31] <steveoh> no so pretty
[16:03:40] <steveoh> compatred to what you put above it's art
[16:03:41] <vjt> and tends towards what is called an "infinite protocol"
[16:03:48] <vjt> haha, ok, points of view :)

[16:37:08] <tkeith> I want to use Javascript (w/ jQuery) to populate a page with items based on a json object. What's the best way to render the html? I assume passing in a string of html is not the best way, but I don't know how else to do it.
[16:38:56] <danzik17> tkeith: use a templating library - underscore templates, mustache.js, handlebars.js, etc.  jquery won't help you much there.
[16:39:41] <tkeith> danzik17: Ah ok, I'll look into those. Would you suggest one in particular?
[16:40:15] <abjorn> depends on what you're looking for
[16:40:28] <abjorn> http://garann.github.com/template-chooser/
[16:40:29] <abjorn> try this
[16:41:36] <zzzzzzLover> ok need help
[16:41:43] <abjorn> werd
[16:41:48] <fission6> danzik17: its borkked i get a stack issue, i think the recurision
[16:42:05] <JavaNinja> so heres my issue, i'm gaining back posts from my database these posts have /n /r
[16:42:21] <JavaNinja> if I remove those everything is fine but if I don't I get an error as i'm echoing back to javascript
[16:42:33] <JavaNinja> what is the proper way to handle /n & /r?
[16:42:52] <JavaNinja> cuz i'm all for it it's just..it's causing an error so i'm not sure how to include it
[16:43:04] <abjorn> what error
[16:43:10] <fission6> gnarf: you around!?
[16:43:14] <JavaNinja> now removing does remove the error...but if the user wants a carriage return i'd like them to have it
[16:43:34] <JavaNinja> cuz it's like newHTML = newHTML + "hello world/n/r";
[16:43:44] <JavaNinja> and for some reason this casues an error
[16:43:49] <danzik17> fission6: so what you're saying is that it seems like "breakUp" is being improperly called when pagination is empty, yes?
[16:43:55] <abjorn> What's the error, yo
[16:43:56] <JavaNinja> vs. just  newHTML = newHTML + "hellow orld";
[16:44:16] <JavaNinja> undetermined string literal
[16:44:39] <fission6> danzik17: well, i am not sure my approach is even correct, do you understand what i am tryin to do?
[16:44:47] <abjorn> How are you using this? Can you put up an example on jsfiddle or something?
[16:44:48] <garann> JavaNinja: got your slashes backward
[16:45:01] <JavaNinja> oh is that why?
[16:45:06] <fission6> i have a bunch of ajax requests i need to group in 3's run them in parallel, when there are done, do the next three
[16:45:15] <JavaNinja> could I replace them with proper slashes?
[16:45:16] <danzik17> fission6: yes, i do - i'm trying to hint that there's a problem in your if statement.
[16:45:34] <JavaNinja> cuz i'm getting data from php
[16:45:58] <JavaNinja> no that's not it I just checked lol
[16:46:04] <JavaNinja> it is looking for \n\r
[16:46:05] <abjorn> JavaNinja: str.replace("/n", "\n")
[16:46:31] <JavaNinja> i have a long piece of code that does this but it basically does str_replace(array("\r\n", "\r"), "\n", $message);
[16:47:14] <JavaNinja> but when my code is done it's removed the \n & \r
[16:47:21] <JavaNinja> but i'd like to keep them if possible......
[16:47:52] <MistuhKurtz> fission6, sounds like a good use for deferred
[16:47:58] <MistuhKurtz> jquery deferred*
[16:48:33] <MistuhKurtz> oh. i -am- in the #jquery channel. lol
[16:48:35] <fission6> MistuhKurtz: yes i am using deferred did you look at my post
[16:48:40] <MistuhKurtz> no
[16:48:46] <MistuhKurtz> didn't see a link
[16:49:05] <fission6> http://jsfiddle.net/GVqXM/3/ again i am trying to bucket groups of ajax requests
[16:49:25] <JavaNinja> here i can make it easier
[16:49:28] <danzik17> fission6: do you see the error im trying to point you at?
[16:49:29] <JavaNinja> var thehtml = "<span id=\"howbig\" style=\"position:absolute;width:280px;font-size:16px;display:inline-block; z-index:-1\"><?php echo $mycommenttext[$i];?></span>";
[16:49:52] <Lucky--> lol they asked an apple exec to resign because of apple maps. Same dude that built mac os x and iOS. Fuckin idiots @ apple . . . Wasn't hit choice to change to apple maps.
[16:49:53] <JavaNinja> so if i put this $mycommenttext[$i] = "hi\n\rstuff"; it throws an exception
[16:50:10] <abjorn> oh
[16:50:11] <abjorn> so
[16:50:16] <abjorn> you're injecting it straight into javascript
[16:50:17] <abjorn> that's why
[16:50:22] <JavaNinja> yeah
[16:50:31] <abjorn> so it's being put in there literally as a newline
[16:50:34] <abjorn> not "\n"
[16:50:37] <JavaNinja> ohhhhhhhh
[16:50:42] <JavaNinja> tytytyty
[16:50:45] <abjorn> lol np
[16:50:49] <JavaNinja> ok so how do I fix though, I get the error finally
[16:50:55] <JavaNinja> that makes sense
[16:51:13] <fission6> danzik17: nah, let me review
[16:51:16] <abjorn> Well, not injecting stuff into your JS with PHP is...preferable...but you could just escape the \n
[16:51:18] <fission6> updating code danzik17
[16:51:27] <JavaNinja> ummm
[16:51:31] <JavaNinja> so... like
[16:51:35] <JavaNinja> hows that look lol
[16:51:38] <JavaNinja> \\n?
[16:51:40] <abjorn> yes
[16:51:49] <JavaNinja> so then stringreplace it?
[16:51:52] <abjorn> yep
[16:52:28] <fission6> danzik17: http://jsfiddle.net/GVqXM/5/ can you point it to me in the new code
[16:53:25] <danzik17> fission6: laptop battery is about to die so ill just tell you at this point:  you should be checking pagination.length, not pagination.
[16:53:38] <MistuhKurtz> yeah I don't know fission6, get the AJAX requests working first
[16:53:53] <MistuhKurtz> then start on the deferred & grouping stuff
[16:54:04] <fission6> danzik17: oh, danzik17 i thought [] was falsy
[16:55:21] <fission6> danzik17: oh i see
[16:56:18] <JavaNinja> oh EM GEEE!!
[16:56:40] <JavaNinja> TWORKED!!
[16:56:56] <JavaNinja> abjorn: OH EM GEEE TY TY TY TY SO MUCH!!
[16:57:06] <JavaNinja> abjorn: had this error for like 4 weeks holy shit!! YES!
[16:57:29] <JavaNinja> abjorn: AND THE PICS ARE LOADING OMG YES!!
[17:05:33] <abjorn> JavaNinja: lol no problem
[17:06:23] <fission6> ok i got it to work but i think its a less than ideal approach, anyone want to review, specific on how to afford the recurion call http://jsfiddle.net/GVqXM/9/

[17:26:38] <mubster> i need to know its divisible by 6
[17:26:40] <coldhead> ?eval 32 % 6 === 0
[17:26:43] <bot-t> coldhead: false
[17:26:44] <mubster> so 36 would be perfect
[17:26:52] <coldhead> ?eval 36 % 6 === 0
[17:26:52] <bot-t> coldhead: true
[17:26:55] <mubster> coldhead
[17:26:59] <mubster> you are awesome!
[17:27:01] <mubster> :D
[17:27:03] <mubster> thanks!
[17:27:14] <coldhead> integer mathematics is awesome :D
[17:27:22] <mubster> exactly what I needed
[17:27:36] <mubster> i did something like that ages ago and couldn't remember at all
[17:27:43] <mubster> well whatever method i had befoe
[17:27:47] <mubster> yours is 10 times better
[17:27:52] <coldhead> % is the modulus operator, if you ever want to google it
[17:28:00] <mubster> thanks cold head you Legend! :)
[17:28:05] <mubster> wiked, will do :)

[17:59:08] <c0pp3rnick> i have a quite height-y div with bunch of <img/> tags in it. I'd like to scroll to given image without anchor stuff, just by determining <img/> position
[17:59:11] <c0pp3rnick> any ideas?
[18:00:06] <coldhead> c0pp3rnick: you could use ?position
[18:00:07] <bot-t> c0pp3rnick, .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[18:00:10] <coldhead> to get the position
[18:00:15] <coldhead> and use ?scrolltop
[18:00:15] <bot-t> .scrollTop(): Get the current vertical position of the scroll bar for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[18:00:19] <coldhead> to move to that position
[18:00:29] <coldhead> (probably)
[18:00:43] <c0pp3rnick> coldhead, yeah, tried that out already, along with .offset()
[18:01:00] <c0pp3rnick> will have to figure it out by myself... aparently =)
[18:01:03] <c0pp3rnick> it's all there =)
[18:03:02] <agi_> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/ruMw3/
[18:03:17] <agi_> it couldnt resize
[18:04:27] <coldhead> c0pp3rnick: http://jsfiddle.net/9DBf7/ works for me
[18:05:05] <grafi> agi_ http://jsfiddle.net/ruMw3/3/
[18:05:33] <coldhead> agi_: you can't get the height() of the contents() of an iframe if the iframe is loading content from another domain
[18:05:35] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[18:06:28] <c0pp3rnick> coldhead, you need to put $(document) instead of $(body)
[18:06:33] <c0pp3rnick> * $('body')
[18:07:02] <coldhead> the hell i do!
[18:07:06] <coldhead> i don't NEED anything
[18:07:16] <coldhead> nah that's cool c0ppert0p, you use whatever you need
[18:07:21] <coldhead> life's too short
[18:07:24] <agi_> coldhead : is there no idea
[18:07:29] <agi_> coldhead : is there no solution
[18:07:44] <coldhead> there may be a solution agi_ but i don't know it
[18:07:51] <coldhead> i have previously given up on that problem
[18:08:05] <agi_> coldhead ok thank you
[18:08:20] <grafi> why would you want to resize an iframe from another domain?
[18:08:41] <grafi> or use an iframe for that matter :P
[18:09:32] <coldhead> agi_: you might be able to set up a proxy on your server and load the iframe through that
[18:09:43] <coldhead> then you'll have access to the height because it will be coming from the same domain
[18:09:56] <coldhead> but the iframe might not work properly then
[18:10:04] <agi_> it impossible
[18:10:06] <coldhead> i don't think there's a pure clientside solution
[18:10:22] <coldhead> it's a giant nosebleed
[18:10:26] <coldhead> i am very sorry for your loss
[18:10:37] <agi_> because, i want to load some pages on my web from local eoffice
[18:10:41] <coldhead> bye forever, mubster
[18:12:01] <coldhead> agi_: http://jsfiddle.net/ruMw3/4/
[18:12:17] <coldhead> that is how you could do it if you have a magical proxy.php on your server

[18:14:40] <Bhavz> hihi
[18:15:27] <Bhavz> would this be the right place to ask help for jquery plugins?
[18:15:33] <Bhavz> i.e, http://suprb.com/apps/gridalicious/
[18:16:31] <RobW> http://pastebin.com/3wR53Kqz - how do I insert a row above #spanned?
[18:17:08] <RobW> will $("table > tbody > tr#spanned").prev().after(html) work ?
[18:19:27] <coldhead> Bhavz: it's worth a shot! i've never seen that plugin mentioned here before but you never know
[18:19:43] <Bhavz> coldhead, haha
[18:19:50] <Bhavz> would you know how to implement it?
[18:19:51] <RobW> nvm it does.
[18:19:55] <Bhavz> I'm clueless
[18:20:17] <coldhead> good work, RobW!
[18:20:21] <Bhavz> I've got my xampp open to public, but since I'm at uni the port is blocked
[18:20:30] <coldhead> of course
[18:20:37] <coldhead> maybe you can make a test case on jsfiddle?
[18:21:26] <RobW> coldhead: usually helps if I save the file and test first :|
[18:21:32] <RobW> the right file rather*
[18:22:57] <coldhead> RobW: i just taught a class in JS and that was the problem in 95% of cases
[18:23:08] <coldhead> you're in broad company
[18:23:31] <MistuhKurtz> lol, really coldhead ?
[18:23:32] <RobW> coldhead: I blame my keyboard 99% of the time.. heh
[18:24:03] <coldhead> true story, MistuhKurtz
[18:24:25] <coldhead> "i can't get this thing to work" "did you save your files?" "i think so, let me retry... oh..."
[18:25:02] <RobW> *facepalm*
[18:56:36] <RobW> wtf
[18:56:43] <RobW> i never thought about this.
[18:56:52] <RobW> to OMIT is to leave out.. but the noun is omission
[18:57:04] <RobW> .. I must be tired.

[18:58:35] <fission6> http://jsfiddle.net/GVqXM/9/ <- anyone want to review this approach to grouping API calls into groups of two
[19:13:06] <grafi> looks good to me, but what do I know ^^
[19:13:24] <coldhead> enough to be dangerous :D
[19:13:33] <grafi> exactly
[19:13:53] <coldhead> i read this earlier, fission6
[19:13:53] <grafi> thats always the most fun amount of knowledge
[19:13:56] <coldhead> it needs more comments
[19:14:36] <grafi> comments are for the weak ^^
[19:14:58] <grafi> "it was hard to write it should be hard to read"
[19:15:40] <coldhead> i got nothing against weakness
[19:15:48] <butblack> suggestions jquery token input or select2?
[19:17:42] <fission6> coldhead: what?
[19:18:19] <coldhead> the algorithm looks good to me but it took me a while to work out what you were doing
[19:18:25] <coldhead> helpful comments could have eased me in
[19:18:29] <fission6> yeah
[19:18:53] <coldhead> nice use of call()
[19:19:16] <fission6> thanks oh wow this is nice http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#designpatternsjavascript
[19:19:27] <grafi> most importantly it doesnt crash with an odd length of pagination, didnt realize slice would manage that :P
[19:19:55] <fission6> grafi: yea spot checked that
[19:20:10] <fission6> my only concern is doing dont(recursiveCall)
[19:20:20] <fission6>  but i guess its not recursive in the usual sense?
[19:21:11] <coldhead> what's wrong with recursion?
[19:22:51] <fission6> is that even recurision?
[19:23:48] <grafi> why not?
[19:24:06] <coldhead> yes of course, you are calling a function within itself
[19:24:20] <coldhead> you're not calling it directly but you're still causing it to recurse
[19:24:27] <fission6> hm
[19:24:43] <fission6> curious how to acheive the same thing without recursion
[19:24:56] <grafi> recursion without recursion?
[19:24:57] <grafi> :D
[19:24:57] <RobW> to recurse: i curse over and over when code doesn't work the way I thought it would... recurse.
[19:25:17] <coldhead> i don't think you can, fission6
[19:25:21] <grafi> RobW measures code quality in curses per minute :P
[19:25:27] <fission6> yea i thought for a bit
[19:25:30] <coldhead> oh you could
[19:25:36] <fission6> i can't come up with anything that isn;t messy
[19:25:46] <coldhead> you could just do a for loop and make an ajax request for each pair
[19:25:59] <coldhead> i did something similar once
[19:26:02] <coldhead> let me try to find
[19:26:29] <fission6> ok
[19:26:50] <fission6> a for loo would block no?
[19:26:59] <grafi> but the loop wouldnt wait until the request were done would it?
[19:29:29] <coldhead> http://0bin.net/paste/685c675bb3922a69583da4ac38b611949e3892c9#6FZEQQEDlanXT1wcKbRMlIi1z7Pny/zITfN0UWbM8VE=
[19:29:35] <coldhead> something like that
[19:30:16] <coldhead> store each deferred into the callbacks array and then pass them all to when()
[19:34:02] <fission6> coldhead: thats different no?
[19:34:45] <fission6> you are chunking the number of requests but not putting them in series after you group them
[19:34:51] <fission6> you are running them all at once
[19:35:06] <coldhead> yes, that's the main difference
[19:35:15] <fission6> so...
[19:35:17] <coldhead> because i didn't care about the number of connections, just the length of the URLs
[19:35:19] <fission6> its not like what i did
[19:35:32] <coldhead> it's similar to what you did!
[19:35:38] <coldhead> shutup!
[19:35:47] <coldhead> no fine
[19:35:51] <fission6> eh. i am concerned about the number of requests per a minut
[19:35:58] <coldhead> if i were you i'd just embrace my recursive solution
[19:36:04] <GoSox> So i've read that javascript can't change the URL in the address bar while NOT actually reloading the current page. but i can clearly see facebook doing this
[19:36:05] <coldhead> and be like a cool guy
[19:36:09] <fission6> so i am grouping in buckets and pausing after each group
[19:36:16] <coldhead> "so ladies, i used recursion today, wanna buy me a drink" etc
[19:36:21] <fission6> coldhead: ill run it by gnarf he is th e man
[19:36:26] <coldhead> he is
[19:36:37] <coldhead> so is danheberden
[19:36:41] <coldhead> a different kind of band
[19:36:43] <coldhead> man*
[19:36:47] <fission6> GoSox: thats likely hash tags
[19:36:50] <coldhead> you can GoSox
[19:36:55] <coldhead> it's the history API
[19:37:10] <coldhead> GoSox: http://diveintohtml5.info/history.html
[19:37:10] <GoSox> fission6: nope no hash tags, its the real deal
[19:37:32] <ML74> is it possible to change a background-image using jquery - with a fade?
[19:37:50] <fission6> ML74: maybe a css transition?
[19:38:00] <fission6> but yea you can fade whatever generall speaking
[19:38:38] <ML74> fission: is that css3? need it to work in non-css3 browsers "
[19:38:43] <danheberden> ML74: either change the bg on an element behind the content and animate its opacity, or use css3 transitions as fission6 mentioned (create a class with the new bg and animate opacity)
[19:40:16] <nicholasschulz> Hello world. Im trying to get the height of the viewpointâ¦ i use "var winW = $(window).width();" but i returns the full height of the document, or so i thinkâ¦ at least a lot more than just the viewpoint
[19:40:20] <nicholasschulz> how come?
[19:41:49] <grafi> height or width? ^^
[19:41:57] <GoSox> thats very cool
[19:42:10] <GoSox> i wish i had known about that like a month ago
[19:43:02] <nicholasschulz> grafi: height
[19:43:08] <nicholasschulz> sorry, i copied the wrong
[19:44:04] <nicholasschulz> var winH = $(window).height();
[19:44:11] <nicholasschulz> still doesn't work, however.
[19:44:23] <grafi> seems to work for me, in firefox :o
[19:45:14] <nicholasschulz> http://bannaky.com/webshop/ click any purseâ¦ the value that appears is the height, the div that appears after is way offâ¦ should be centered both vertically and horizontally
[19:47:58] <grafi> hm
[19:48:04] <grafi> thats crazy ^^
[19:50:45] <nicholasschulz> idk why it happens.. never experienced this problem before
[19:51:05] <RobW> wtf math?
[19:51:08] <RobW> use %
[19:51:32] <RobW> left: 50%; top: 50%; margin-left: -XXpx; margin-top: -XXpx;
[19:51:42] <RobW> where XX is WIDTH / 2 of div (or HEIGHT / 2 of div)
[19:52:16] <RobW> left: 50%; top: 50%; margin-left: -XXpx; margin-top: -YYpx; ....... XX = div.width() / 2..... YY = div.height() / 2
[19:52:21] <RobW> like that for example
[19:52:30] <coldhead> that's neat, RobW
[19:52:39] <RobW> nicholasschulz: are you taking into consideration of the div height itself?
[19:53:26] <grafi> but shouldnt the window object have some kind of height?
[19:53:37] <grafi> window.HEIGHT just returns undefined oÃ´
[19:53:40] <RobW> yea that's not the visible height though..
[19:54:12] <nicholasschulz> robw: http://jsfiddle.net/gnWMQ/
[19:56:24] <nicholasschulz> thats the code i use right now
[19:56:38] <RobW> ah
[19:56:51] <nicholasschulz> can you find a flaw?
[19:57:01] <RobW> several
[19:57:07] <nicholasschulz> ok, good :-)
[19:57:33] <RobW> something's wrong with the dom on your site i think
[19:57:42] <RobW> see http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fbannaky.com%2Fwebshop%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[19:58:05] <RobW> idk if that's why or not.. still looking
[20:03:02] <nicholasschulz> RobW: even on this test.php page, it doesn't workâ¦. ? http://bannaky.com/webshop/test.php
[20:03:05] <nicholasschulz> look at the source
[20:03:53] <RobW> nicholasschulz: you're missing body tag...
[20:03:56] <RobW> fix it
[20:04:05] <RobW> and script should go within body.
[20:05:12] <nicholasschulz> still,.
[20:06:43] <RobW> fix your doctype too
[20:08:21] <kam187-rMBP> err stupid question, but how do i select all list views on a page?
[20:08:31] <kam187-rMBP> i want to refresh them all
[20:08:36] <RobW> what are list views
[20:08:53] <kam187-rMBP> doh sorry wrong channel - meant jq mobile
[20:08:56] <kam187-rMBP> ignore me :P
[20:08:57] <RobW> :]
[20:09:42] <nicholasschulz> idk,. whatever i do it doesn't seem to work....
[20:10:02] <RobW> nicholasschulz: I'm not seeing your changes..
[20:10:32] <nicholasschulz> i added the doctpye and the body tags
[20:10:45] <RobW> I'm looking at http://bannaky.com/webshop/ and I don't see it
[20:11:06] <nicholasschulz> oh, i was working on the testâ¦ give me 2 seconds
[20:12:48] <nicholasschulz> RobW, now its live
[20:12:55] <RobW> its wrong
[20:12:55] <nicholasschulz> but still doesn't work
[20:13:05] <nicholasschulz> Ok, why?
[20:13:06] <RobW> your doctypes should be very first line
[20:13:09] <RobW> doctype*
[20:13:46] <RobW> followed by <head>[..]</head> <body>[...]</body>
[20:13:55] <nicholasschulz> RobW: Yey! it now give the value 618 instead of 1138
[20:14:02] <RobW> yup
[20:14:06] <RobW> fix your doctype
[20:14:09] <nicholasschulz> :-) however the div is still off
[20:14:28] <RobW> your math is probably wrong
[20:14:49] <RobW> "top": quickBuyWidthOffset,
[20:14:57] <RobW> ^^ .. why are you using the WIDTH value for TOP
[20:23:28] <VectorX> tw2113 can i pm you

[20:28:54] <VectorX> coming up with a plan to save the victims of hurricane sandy
[20:29:38] <tw2113> i think that'd be better as a group discussion
[20:32:18] <VectorX> tw2113 yeah i guess
[20:37:32] <adlwalrus> anyone familiar with the outerWidth() function?
[20:38:17] <snover> no, nobody
[20:38:39] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @ adlwalrus
[20:38:40] <bot-t> adlwalrus, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[20:48:25] <adlwalrus> ryanneufeld: sorry, my bad.
[20:49:45] <adlwalrus> I'm porting a jquery plugin to another framework. and there's one line in it that calls an element's outerWidth() and outerHeight() functions. I'm wondering how one would re-implement.
[20:49:58] <adlwalrus> ...those functions.
[20:50:18] <tw2113> ?outerwidth @ adlwalrus
[20:50:19] <bot-t> adlwalrus, .outerWidth([includeMargin]): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding and border. http://api.jquery.com/outerWidth/
[20:50:23] <RobW> adlwalrus.. you add the padding, margin, and border..
[20:52:39] <SpeedTheory> adlwalrus, can you not view jQuery source?
[20:55:29] <adlwalrus> SpeedTheory: I have, but I can't find it.
[20:55:46] <RobW> ctrl+f
[20:55:48] <RobW> "outerwidth"
[20:56:20] <adlwalrus> ^F'ing on the 1.8.1 source code gave two matches for outerWidth.
[20:56:20] <adlwalrus> neither appeared to be a function definition.
[20:56:30] <adlwalrus> in fact, both were in comments. so...
[20:58:01] <RobW> adlwalrus: just use x.offsetWidth lol
[21:00:19] <moneal> I need to find the closest parent element with a given class but I have no context to start the search. I can output my script right after the element. How can I find the closets parent to the script thats currently running?
[21:00:37] <adlwalrus> RobW: is that a jquery function?
[21:00:50] <RobW> adlwalrus: no. it's a cross-browser compatible JS function
[21:00:54] <RobW> moneal: current example?
[21:01:42] <adlwalrus> RobW: oh, seriously?
[21:01:55] <adlwalrus> RobW: that's perfect, then.
[21:01:55] <adlwalrus> brb
[21:01:58] <RobW> adlwalrus: yes that's why it's kind of funnehhh
[21:03:35] <adlwalrus> RobW: well then, what's the rationale for outerWidth?
[21:03:39] <moneal> RobW: http://pastebin.com/LaWeUWrZ
[21:03:57] <raj> even when using $.when($.ajax({'url':url, 'success':function(data){$(function() {$('#content').hide().html(data); $.getScript('somestyles.js')})}).then(function(){$('#content').show()}) i get FOUC because `when` is not completing before `then`
[21:04:00] <adlwalrus> RobW: is it somehow different or better than offsetWidth?
[21:04:13] <RobW> adlwalrus: huh
[21:04:33] <RobW> its just a jquery method i suppose, where you can define to include margins or not
[21:04:38] <RobW> so i guess it's slightly flexible??
[21:04:43] <RobW> idk tbh
[21:05:12] <adlwalrus> RobW: how do jQuery.fn.outerWidth and DOMElement.offsetWidth differ, or are they identical?
[21:05:13] <adlwalrus> RobW: ah, ok.
[21:05:13] <adlwalrus> well, cool.
[21:05:18] <adlwalrus> that was one of the sore-points.
[21:05:40] <RobW> i think .outerWidth() will subtract margins, unless you provide true as the parameter
[21:05:59] <RobW> moneal: eh?
[21:06:22] <RobW> moneal: do you want this._super() ?
[21:07:44] <RobW> of course you'd have to define it.
[21:07:57] <RobW> ex: http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/
[21:09:24] <moneal> it this was the current script element and not the document that would be fine
[21:09:50] <adlwalrus> RobW: it appears to be a microsoft quirk: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.offsetWidth#Specification
[21:11:55] <RobW> adlwalrus: works in all browsers?

[21:48:20] <gnarf> fission6: still here?
[21:56:36] <GoSox> is there a way I can print a different page, when the user prints, using javascript? Either by simply deleting or hiding the current body tag, and inserting a new body tag read from another page on my site. Or by simply doing a redirect at the moment of print?
[21:56:49] <GoSox> I know all about CSS media types, but a new style sheet just isn't going to cut it here
[21:58:38] <Cork> GoSox: can provide a print link and there load the other page in a section on the page
[21:58:50] <Cork> hidden in normal view, and the only thing visible in the print css
[21:59:46] <GoSox> right but i don't want to load the whole second printable page for everyone, so the maybe 1% of users can print it out. If i was going to do that, i'd just make the print link, link to a full separate page, which is my last resort if i can't find anything a littleâ¦ coooler
[22:00:11] <Cork> GoSox: the "and there load the other page"
[22:00:11] <GoSox> can javascript "intercept" the print command?
[22:00:16] <Cork> as in load it though ajax
[22:00:18] <tw2113> why can't print style sheets be used again?
[22:00:32] <Cork> not sure, it should be possible to do most anything
[22:01:09] <GoSox> Cork: but if it's activated through an actual HTML link, then why bother loading with ajax when I can just as easily GO TO that printable page?
[22:01:23] <GoSox> i'd like something that would work on a native printing invocation right through the file menu
[22:02:16] <Cork> GoSox: cause then you would have to trigger the print from load on that page
[22:02:19] <Cork> but sure that works
[22:02:40] <Cork> GoSox: theres only the print media css for that
[22:08:06] <GoSox> i tried doing some trickery with the css content property but no luck
[22:08:36] <GoSox> i was hoping i could do something like body:after { content: url(printable.php); }
[22:12:23] <tw2113> GoSox, why can't you provide a print stylesheet again?
[22:14:53] <GoSox> because it would make things too complicated. every time i updated the main page, i'd have to edit the print css sheet. i want printable pages that are fully self contained from my regular pages, but I still want you to get to them from regular browser printing. PLUS i want my printable pages to be pixel perfect so they print on a few pieces of paper as possible, which would be much much easier if my printable pages has their own HTM
[22:15:24] <GoSox> which itself would not be hard at all because all of my content comes out of a database anyway, so it's not like i'd be "rewriting a printable copy of all of my pages"
[22:16:06] <GoSox> i think i'm just going to have to do a plain html link to a separate page and that's as good as it's going to get
[22:16:38] <tw2113> i think it'd be easier to just edit the print.css file or whatever you name it
[22:16:56] <tw2113> than trying to hack together some solution like this
[22:16:59] <tw2113> but that's me
[22:26:29] <coldhead> i am not for you for me this time
[22:27:34] <raj> you're here for you this time? cool, how may I help? :)
[22:28:36] <coldhead> sorry wrong window
[22:28:51] <coldhead> (to be a lover in the winter tony oh tony oh)
[22:35:29] <nights> hey guys
[22:38:34] <nights> so im trying to use google maps, and whenever someone change a dropdown i want to move the center of the map to that location. i have the ajax call and i know how to move the map, but im not sure what to write in the success of the ajax call to transfer the coordinates. can anyone help?
[22:38:42] <nights> basically have
[22:38:43] <nights> success: function( html )
[22:38:44] <nights> and
[22:38:49] <nights> map.setCenter(new google.maps.LatLng(y, x));
[22:39:07] <nights> what should i return from the async function to be able to populate x,y
[22:39:07] <nights> ?
[22:39:39] <coldhead> how many entries in your dropdown?
[22:39:56] <raj> I'm having an issue where the stuff in $.when() is not being completed before the stuff in .then() http://paste.ofcode.org/SheWFXaBV9dnTCQ7B7vTLE and therefore I'm getting FOUC
[22:40:00] <nights> maybe it has to be success: function( data ) ?
[22:40:12] <nights> coldhead: could be many..
[22:40:36] <coldhead> nights: i would return json data with lat and long co-ords
[22:40:42] <coldhead> and tell ajax to expct JSON data
[22:40:57] <nights> coldhead: would it be a stupid idea to populate a javascript table with coords when i generate the page and then use that?
[22:41:08] <coldhead> then you can go success: function (data) { googleyStuff.here( data.lat, data.long ) }
[22:41:09] <nights> to avoid having to make a async call
[22:41:25] <coldhead> that's why i was asking, nights
[22:41:33] <nights> coldhead: hm,, well then its not that many
[22:41:39] <nights> but i rather do it in a classy way
[22:41:39] <coldhead> if it's not many then you should just make the co-ords the value= for each entry
[22:41:42] <nights> like the one you proposed
[22:41:44] <coldhead> and not have to bother the server
[22:41:48] <nights> cus im sure i will run into more of this
[22:42:21] <nights> coldhead: hm, actually i also need to store the ID of the destination (and the long lat is just for interactivity)
[22:42:39] <nights> but i meant to populate like a array
[22:42:43] <nights> instead of putting into value
[22:42:47] <coldhead> you could store all of those
[22:42:49] <nights> that would give more flexibility
[22:43:10] <nights> so you mean parsing the value into separate variables?
[22:43:26] <azbyin> hi all..
[22:43:28] <nights> isnt it better to just store it in a large map then?
[22:43:54] <nights> i think i will try the JSON way you proposed
[22:44:01] <nights> dont really know too much about that and sounds cool
[22:44:01] <azbyin> does $.ajax automatically use the right underlying func for cross domain requests?
[22:44:19] <coldhead> good luck nights !
[22:44:21] <nights> coldhead: just dont like the delay that async call causes :(
[22:44:34] <coldhead> azbyin: no, it doesn't
[22:44:37] <abjorn> :o
[22:44:39] <azbyin> $.ajax seems to work fine for same origin requests, but for corss domain requests, it only works in ff,chromium, etc.
[22:44:46] <azbyin> coldhead, what?
[22:44:53] <coldhead> there is some support for CORS if you enable it but it's not cross browser
[22:45:08] <azbyin> why doesn;t it automatically choose to use the right object?
[22:45:15] <abjorn> that's not the problem
[22:45:20] <abjorn> the problem is CORS doesn't work everywhere
[22:45:32] <coldhead> azbyin: do whatever abjorn says, he knows things
[22:45:39] <nights> coldhead; found this, pretty good: http://www.islandsmooth.com/2010/04/send-and-receive-json-data-using-ajax-jquery-and-php/
[22:45:44] <tw2113> yeah, coldhead is kind of new
[22:45:45] <coldhead> nights: if you want to avoid the delay you have to include the data in the page
[22:45:52] <abjorn> tw2113 is right
[22:45:56] <coldhead> which is how i'd do it for simplicity
[22:46:05] <abjorn> this is coldhead's first day in #jquery
[22:46:06] <coldhead> but for fun then sure, json and ajax good times, great taste
[22:46:15] <coldhead> SHAKE IT BABY
[22:46:23] <coldhead> DON'T GO VACANT BABY
[22:46:35] <tw2113> *shakes like a polaroid picture*
[22:46:51] <azbyin> ok. i have cors working properly with the right headers and even with auth  (with right headers from the server side and on the client side with $.ajax on ff, chromium)
[22:47:00] <abjorn> azbyin: cross origin stuff has...well, lots and lots of options, the best option depends on what your requirements are
[22:47:16] <abjorn> yeah but it's still not going to work in every browser, though
[22:47:21] <abjorn> right headers or not :p
[22:47:24] <azbyin> so either $.ajax is not using the right object (xdomainrequest or something silly on ie)
[22:47:28] <nights> coldhead: yeah, that would be more for fun. agreed
[22:47:42] <azbyin> or it is using the right object yet failing for unknown reasons
[22:47:43] <nights> but already having a lot of unavoidable ajax delays
[22:47:46] <nights> so one more
[22:47:47] <nights> is ok
[22:47:53] <coldhead> o/
[22:47:58] <nights> more interested in spending time optimizing those
[22:48:07] <nights> like google async is so fast
[22:48:12] <nights> like spreadsheets and those
[22:48:18] <abjorn> brah
[22:48:20] <abjorn> azbyin
[22:48:24] <abjorn> jquery ain't the problem
[22:48:25] <nights> wonder if theres something special to it
[22:48:39] <nights> coldhead: btw, do you need like overrideMimeType set to JSON ?
[22:48:51] <nights> coldhead: application/json;charset=UTF-8
[22:48:53] <nights> or will it work without?
[22:48:56] <coldhead> nights: dataType: 'json' usually suffices
[22:48:59] <abjorn> ^
[22:49:06] <coldhead> but you can do fancy mime stuff if you're into that
[22:49:09] <abjorn> tbh I never even need to do that
[22:49:10] <azbyin> ok, i'm willing to concede to that. is it using the right object though? xdr on ie ?
[22:49:11] <nights> This tells your client to expect a JSON response and is necessary to prevent problems with some clients.
[22:49:14] <abjorn> jquery is smart about that
[22:49:33] <coldhead> i make my server bitches change the mimetypes sometimes because there are ugly warnings in chrome when they don't
[22:49:43] <abjorn> >server bitches
[22:49:43] <abjorn> rofl
[22:49:47] <nights> coldhead: so you always put that into beforeSend?
[22:49:49] <coldhead> and you have to tell those smug jerks what to do sometimes or they strut around preening themselves
[22:49:54] <abjorn> coldhead has binders full of server bitches
[22:49:57] <coldhead> like diamond stufded goldfish
[22:50:08] <coldhead> god no, nights, i never use beforeSend()
[22:50:13] <nights> ok
[22:50:18] <coldhead> dataType is an argument to ajax()
[22:50:26] <nights> so where do you put 'json'?
[22:50:26] <nights> ah
[22:50:32] <coldhead> oh darling i
[22:50:34] <nights> where does it go?
[22:50:42] <abjorn> azbyin: where are your CORS requests not working?
[22:50:43] <nights> dataType: "json",
[22:50:44] <nights> ?
[22:50:46] <abjorn> where as in which browsers
[22:50:46] <nights> like that
[22:50:52] <coldhead> $.ajax({ ..., dataType: 'json', ... });
[22:51:00] <nights> ok, perfect
[22:51:06] <nights> just started with jquery and so far its brilliant
[22:51:12] <nights> docs are very good too
[22:51:18] <nights> tho i prefer getting spoon fed in here
[22:51:20] <nights> :p
[22:51:21] <abjorn> ?ajaxConfig
[22:51:22] <bot-t> abjorn, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[22:51:28] <azbyin> abjorn, *only* in ie9 it is *not* working. i don;t care about ie < 8. all other browsers it works fine
[22:51:28] <abjorn> fuk u bot-t
[22:51:30] <abjorn> jk ilu
[22:51:34] <abjorn> i love you bot-t
[22:51:35] <bot-t> no you don't
[22:51:38] <abjorn> YES I DO
[22:51:56] <coldhead> nights: it also adheres to the principle of least surprise so if you guess how something might work it usually works just that way (unless your brain is installed wrong)
[22:52:02] <tw2113> i hate you bot-t
[22:52:03] <bot-t> NO U
[22:52:13] <coldhead> DO WE NEED ORDER GOODBYE
[22:52:20] <abjorn> o okay that one IS actually a bug, I believe, azbyin
[22:52:24] <abjorn> it should work in IE 8 though
[22:53:09] <abjorn> azbyin: looks like they rejected a fix for that, you need to use a plugin
[22:53:47] <jrockjiggz> hey, i have this annoying behavior associated with my web application.. I normally hold content in a DIV that is replaced with HTML loaded in via ajax.  when I start the load, I clear the div to show a 'loading' img.. the browser's viewport (when scrolled to the bottom) will jump up because of the lack of the content, then when the new content is loaded, you have to scroll back down to see what
[22:53:47] <jrockjiggz> is there...
[22:54:20] <jrockjiggz> this jumping up and down and scrolling is a bit inconvenient
[22:54:28] <azbyin> abjorn, wheres the bug or the bugfix? and why the hell would there be need for a plugin for this?
[22:54:42] <abjorn> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8283 it's late so I didn't bother reading all the way through
[22:54:45] <azbyin> cors should work transparently from within jquery itself
[22:54:48] <abjorn> I'm sure they have goooooood reasons
[22:55:08] <azbyin> i doubt it. since all there is needed is a change in the underlying func call
[22:55:31] <abjorn> well, it's not core ajax
[22:55:37] <abjorn> it's technically a separate thing altogether
[22:56:16] <coldhead> jrockjiggz: give the loading gif a big margin-bottom or w/e to occupy the space
[22:56:17] <abjorn> though considering it works in other browsers simply because XHR supports it in other browsers does make that kind of a grey area
[22:56:21] <raj> I'm having an issue where the stuff in $.when() is not being completed before the stuff in .then() http://paste.ofcode.org/LB9kRqHCZJZNLkLrDA7vMe and therefore I'm getting FOUC. If I uncomment line 16, I get no FOUC
[22:56:23] <coldhead> or give the container a min-height
[22:56:58] <jrockjiggz> coldhead: hmm ok
[22:57:35] <abjorn> azbyin: I'm inclined to agree with you on that, though, but I understand to some degree why they wouldn't.
[22:57:41] <coldhead> it's gross, jrockjiggz, but you know it makes sense
[22:57:47] <coldhead> the browser is doing the right thing
[22:57:52] <coldhead> if there's nothing there... there's nothing there
[22:58:06] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[22:58:06] <jrockjiggz> coldhead: actually I just thought of this, maybe i'll just fade-out the div, and only replace the div with new content
[22:58:12] <abjorn> lol coldhead
[22:58:16] <coldhead> fadeTo(0) ?
[22:58:20] <coldhead> that's a favourite
[22:58:23] <azbyin> no, this should be in core. it is stupid to not allow it in
[22:58:36] <jrockjiggz> fadeTo(0) is same as display: none ?
[22:58:37] <azbyin> if this is not included, why the heck is cors allowed with xmlhttprequest
[22:58:47] <abjorn> ...because they don't have to do anything to support it?
[22:58:57] <azbyin> they should say "in any cases of using cors, please use the following plugins"
[22:58:59] <abjorn> it supports it in other browsers because xhr in other browsers supports it
[22:59:08] <coldhead> you should ask for your money back azbyin :P
[22:59:11] <abjorn> ^
[22:59:16] <azbyin> and xdomainrequest supports it too
[22:59:28] <azbyin> coldhead, i'm not saying i need my money back yet :)
[22:59:32] <abjorn> yes but they're not using xdomainrequest :p
[22:59:41] <abjorn> the point is that they never had any intention to support CORS
[22:59:47] <abjorn> it just HAPPENS to support it on those browsers
[23:00:21] <coldhead> thank god you're here with this kind of wisdom, abjorn
[23:00:27] <azbyin> just that the whole point of abstracting away the variable underlying func calls to a common higher level api is one big reason to use jquery
[23:00:28] <coldhead> i know so little about CORS
[23:00:48] <abjorn> si senor
[23:00:52] <abjorn> @ azbyin
[23:00:58] <abjorn> and lol coldhead
[23:01:02] <abjorn> I had experimented with it
[23:01:02] <azbyin> for example the MDN page for node.textContent says ie9+ supports it
[23:01:15] <abjorn> but when it comes down to it, it's not ready for those kinds of reasons
[23:01:26] <coldhead> I FORGOT I FORGOT I FORGOT I FORGOT I FORGOT IT'S SO DIAGONAL I NEVER USED TO I FORGOT WHEN YOU I FORGOT IN YOUR EYES I BEEN FEELING NEATO
[23:01:34] <abjorn> and if you have no control over the endpoint you might not have a choice anyways
[23:01:37] <azbyin> but you know what? it works only for html node elements, not *xml* node elements which are the usual return datatype for ajax calls
[23:01:55] <abjorn> which is why I lean towards either JSONP or just using a fuckin reverse proxy
[23:02:04] <azbyin> so, to stop me from writing if/else crap, i use jquery .text()
[23:02:58] <raj> can someone tell me how to ensure an ajax success function is executed before another function is run?
[23:03:03] <raj> when/then don't work
[23:03:44] <azbyin> raj you understand what the first 'a' in ajax stands for, right?
[23:04:07] <raj> yes sir
[23:05:10] <abjorn> you call the other function in the ajax success handler, yo
[23:05:13] <azbyin> and why do you ask if you are able to ensure some *other* function is exec'd before the success callback?
[23:05:38] <raj> well, this doesn't work
[23:05:38] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/LB9kRqHCZJZNLkLrDA7vMe
[23:05:39] <azbyin> if you want this to happen, then just cal you function directly as the callback and then simply call your 'real' callback at the end
[23:05:42] <raj> I still get FOUC
[23:06:03] <raj> and if I put the stuff in `then` within the `success` function, I still get FOUC
[23:07:15] <azbyin> what the heck is FOUC? and why the heck cant you put it at the end of the success handler?
[23:07:33] <abjorn> because your css hasn't loaded by the time you insert the content, yo
[23:07:57] <snover> YO
[23:07:57] <azbyin> ok really? then you ought to move your <script> tags to the end of body
[23:08:01] <abjorn> YO
[23:08:25] <azbyin> surely css has loaded by then, unless you have multi-megabyte css files
[23:08:58] <raj> yeah, css should be loaded
[23:08:59] <abjorn> he's dynamically loading in a stylesheet when he grabs the new content
[23:09:00] <abjorn> it looks like
[23:09:02] <abjorn> which is
[23:09:06] <abjorn> not a thing you should do
[23:09:32] <raj> why not?
[23:09:41] <nights> coldhead: works great btw.
[23:10:15] <raj> it's not the css that's not loading
[23:10:22] <abjorn> because it's really unnecessary, and you end up with situations like this. If you're going to need it, but it in the page to begin with
[23:10:36] <raj> I gave it time to load before doing the rest, and it doesn't solve the issue
[23:10:52] <raj> however, giving the js time to load before fading in fixes the issue
[23:11:03] <raj> abjorn, it's not the css file
[23:11:06] <raj> it's the js files
[23:11:14] <raj> the css styles are all loaded
[23:11:41] <abjorn> $.getScript('static/js/morestyles.js')
[23:11:41] <abjorn> wats dat
[23:11:47] <raj> a js file
[23:11:52] <abjorn> really now
[23:12:15] <abjorn> the point is
[23:12:18] <abjorn> what's it doing
[23:12:33] <raj> it's manipulating the dom and adding styles as well
[23:12:39] <abjorn> okay
[23:12:41] <abjorn> well
[23:12:49] <abjorn> you need to show the document when THAT is done
[23:12:51] <abjorn> you're not
[23:13:13] <raj> because that file has code that manipulates the dom
[23:13:17] <abjorn> ya
[23:13:36] <nights> noticed something pretty interesting, until now i was always looking at the chrome XHR tab to see how fast async requests were. but seems like thats not very accurate
[23:13:41] <raj> so I must load the dom (#content), then the js file, then show the hidden #content
[23:13:47] <abjorn> ya
[23:13:48] <nights> in fact they are much faster than what chrome says
[23:14:09] <coldhead> why would chrome lie!
[23:14:39] <abjorn> raj: http://paste.ofcode.org/npp9dLsSUQFJ9E3mwEjCGR
[23:15:05] <abjorn> according to what, nights?
[23:15:29] <abjorn> also it might be counting the time taken in the ajax handler
[23:16:31] <azbyin> raj, also why are you missing semicolons everywhere?
[23:16:38] <raj> abjorn, that works beautifully
[23:16:42] <raj> thanks!
[23:16:52] <raj> now what if there were 10 getScripts?
[23:17:00] <raj> just throw it onto the last one?
[23:17:09] <abjorn> no
[23:17:09] <coldhead> don't have 10 getScripts
[23:17:13] <abjorn> yeah, that
[23:17:14] <abjorn> rofl
[23:17:19] <abjorn> but if you HAD to
[23:17:23] <abjorn> you'd have to either
[23:17:31] <abjorn> A) Chain them all together in callbacks which would be a BITCH
[23:17:31] <abjorn> or
[23:17:32] <azbyin> no, you use promise   http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[23:17:44] <abjorn> B) Use something like that, or the async library
[23:17:52] <abjorn> https://github.com/caolan/async <3
[23:17:57] <nights> abjorn: well i can see that the update is immediate, but chrome reports it like a second after
[23:18:04] <nights> and its not cached!
[23:18:10] <azbyin> lol, why would you pull in an extra dependency when jquery has promise already?
[23:18:25] <abjorn> Well, it may report it a second after but it's still probably accurate, nights
[23:18:37] <nights> no, it says 250 ms
[23:18:45] <nights> but its more like 20ms
[23:18:53] <abjorn> azbyin: because promise doesn't solve all the problems async does, but for his case i would think it would work fine
[23:18:58] <azbyin> and you have perceived with your eyes that it is much smaller than 250ms ?
[23:19:02] <nights> yes
[23:19:06] <azbyin> lol
[23:19:12] <nights> in fact its probably faster
[23:19:22] <azbyin> yeah, like 200 ns, right?
[23:19:23] <nights> 20ms is the time it takes for the map to redraw with the new location
[23:19:44] <abjorn> according to
[23:19:46] <abjorn> your eyes?
[23:19:46] <nights> well its absolutely not like 500ms which i see sometimes
[23:19:50] <nights> yes my eyes
[23:19:54] <abjorn> okay then
[23:19:59] <azbyin> fix them quick matey
[23:20:04] <abjorn> you are quite the talented man, being able to determine that with your eyes
[23:20:27] <abjorn> In fact, I believe that would make you the next step in the evolutionary chain.
[23:20:36] <nights> here we go
[23:20:41] <abjorn> lol
[23:20:43] <azbyin> abjorn, maybe his clock speed is much higher than ours :)
[23:20:57] <abjorn> ah, overclocking I see
[23:21:02] <abjorn> void yer warranty that way
[23:21:05] <nights> if you guys cant tell the difference between 250ms and 20ms your sensory system is not working well i can tell you
[23:21:31] <coldhead> too much coffee
[23:21:44] <coldhead> nights: i can't tell the difference between one day and another
[23:21:56] <abjorn> which is why it's been his first day for like a year
[23:22:02] <azbyin> yeah, its always been coldhead's first day with jquery for many years now :)
[23:22:07] <dns-away> hello
[23:22:11] <abjorn> wut up yo
[23:26:02] <nights> here you guys can read
[23:26:03] <nights> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6880856/whats-the-minimum-lag-detectable-by-a-human
[23:26:06] <abjorn> leg, y u cramp
[23:26:07] <b-ot> (å±®'Ð')å±®
[23:26:29] <abjorn> thank you, b-ot
[23:26:44] <abjorn> it's quite uncomfortable
[23:26:48] <nights> also
[23:26:55] <nights> if you play a game at 10 fps
[23:26:59] <nights> you would most likely complain
[23:27:07] <nights> even at 20
[23:27:08] <coldhead> not if it were chess
[23:27:09] <coldhead> or go
[23:27:12] <abjorn> ^
[23:27:14] <coldhead> or nethack
[23:27:15] <nights> anyway
[23:27:18] <nights> i think i proved my point
[23:27:20] <abjorn> unless it was a very animated chess
[23:27:28] <abjorn> no, you missed my point, but it's not worth talking about lol
[23:27:30] <nights> and chrome doesnt seem accurate in measuring
[23:27:46] <coldhead> you should also demand your money back
[23:27:49] <abjorn> ya
[23:27:52] <abjorn> 4srs
[23:27:55] <nights> :)
[23:27:56] <nights> yes
[23:27:58] <azbyin> mate, point to a peer-reviewed publication in a journal
[23:28:08] <azbyin> not a stack-overflow question
[23:28:25] <abjorn> coldhead: How are you enjoying your first day in #jquery, going well I hope
[23:28:36] <abjorn> Is everyone being friendly to you?
[23:28:45] <coldhead> yes you people seem very nice
[23:28:49] <coldhead> i will be back tomorrow
[23:29:02] <azbyin> for your first day or jquery, right?
[23:29:03] <abjorn> which, with your ability of perception, will be about 8 months from now
[23:29:08] <coldhead> also lol peer review
[23:29:12] <abjorn> c:
[23:29:17] <nights> ok lunch time
[23:29:20] <coldhead> i'm not sure that day will ever come
[23:29:23] <coldhead> happy lunch nights!
[23:29:28] <nights> thanks, you too
[23:29:32] <coldhead> man i do not get any work done before lunch
[23:29:37] <coldhead> you are a gold star worker
[23:29:37] <abjorn> lol
[23:29:44] <abjorn> I get my work done only at lunch
[23:29:48] <coldhead> after lunch i like to take it easy
[23:30:04] <abjorn> so you don't get any work done before lunch
[23:30:08] <abjorn> and you like to take it easy after lunch
[23:30:10] <raj> omg, did none of my msgs just get through?
[23:30:12] <abjorn> so basically you don't get any work done
[23:30:27] <abjorn> raj: haven't seen any in awhile
[23:30:29] <raj> i just dc/rc'd
[23:30:33] <raj> k
[23:31:04] <coldhead> i get lunch, abjorn
[23:31:07] <coldhead> that's the main thing
[23:31:09] <raj> all of my issues boil down to the fact that I now need a website that doesn't refresh. However, I haven't built my site as a singlepage site. Therefore, I'm trying to load url's using ajax into the #content section of my base page. What would be the best way of doing this? All my pages are interactive and use GET requests
[23:31:16] <abjorn> coldhead: naturally
[23:31:20] <raj> so I can't just load all the js files off the bat
[23:31:23] <coldhead> i had a good club sandwich today
[23:31:25] <raj> because the files would interfere with one another
[23:31:38] <raj> oh, unless I made sure the url was relevant for each function...meaning check the url at the start of every function in every file
[23:31:40] <coldhead> what kind of monster are you building, raj
[23:31:50] <coldhead> it sounds very precarious
[23:31:51] <abjorn> If you need a website that doesn't referesh you build it as a single page app from the beginning
[23:31:52] <abjorn> that's how you do that
[23:31:54] <raj> is there a better way at this point?
[23:32:06] <abjorn> Why do you need it to not refresh?
[23:32:21] <raj> because I can't break the sockjs connection
[23:32:21] <Chel> question: why this code prints "undefined" to IE9 console ? https://gist.github.com/590d6fc41e5eeb49fbc3  jquery version = 1.8.1
[23:32:31] <abjorn> ic
[23:32:36] <abjorn> WELL
[23:33:02] <abjorn> you are going about it the wrong way methinks
[23:33:13] <raj> what should I do
[23:33:25] <raj> using backbone or angular at this point is impossible
[23:33:39] <raj> the websites nearly done and now I'm dealing with this
[23:33:49] <abjorn> Uh, well, it's not going to be practical to convert an existing, normal site, into a single page app
[23:33:53] <abjorn> But I suppose you can try
[23:34:12] <abjorn> I wouldn't suggest using jQuery to manage loading your dependencies, though
[23:34:13] <abjorn> fo reals
[23:34:34] <abjorn> should have all your css loaded from the get go, imho, and use something like requirejs for loading in your javascript
[23:34:55] <coldhead> here is some of the code i have been working on today https://paste.lugons.org/show/OfZyVjeHPo3yh2hV6ASg/
[23:34:59] <coldhead> note the helpful comments
[23:35:02] <raj> ok, then I can load them all in the beginning and check the url using $.history at the start of every function of every js file
[23:35:10] <raj> requirejs?
[23:35:17] <raj> why would that help?
[23:35:27] <abjorn> it's a script loader
[23:35:38] <raj> yeah, but it doesn't unload
[23:35:47] <abjorn> why would you want to unload
[23:35:48] <abjorn> scripts
[23:36:14] <raj> so the script files don't conflict from url to url (dynamic urls)
[23:36:26] <abjorn> that's not really how you do that
[23:36:39] <abjorn> for one, requirejs will prevent you from getting conflicts
[23:36:42] <abjorn> and
[23:36:44] <abjorn> use functions, yo
[23:36:46] <raj> (whatever dynamic urls are called in modern browsers...the thing $.history works with)
[23:37:04] <raj> i am using functions
[23:37:32] <abjorn> you shouldn't ever load a script more than once in the time your app runs
[23:37:33] <raj> but for example, two js files that pertain to two different urls access the same class/id'd element
[23:37:47] <raj> so if I load both those js files, there'll be an issue
[23:38:07] <abjorn> they won't if you do it properly
[23:38:15] <abjorn> you load/unload event handlers, not scripts
[23:38:24] <raj> aah
[23:38:27] <abjorn> well, bind/unbind
[23:38:29] <abjorn> but you get what I mean
[23:38:45] <abjorn> otherwise you're going to be wasting a lot of script loading time
[23:39:35] <Chel> anyone can help me ? even a official manual examples dont work
[23:39:43] <abjorn> whatchya need
[23:39:53] <abletony84> At this calculate-and-set-column-width script at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/yCEJs/2/ - purely cosmetic but, is there any way to do without "var widest_odd" and "var widest_even"?
[23:44:25] <raj> jc, my internet disconnected agai
[23:44:30] <raj> n
[23:44:46] <gnarf> ?tell fission6 sorry I missed you the other day - if there's something in particular you want my advice on feel free to type it all out and ping me, I'll read it :)
[23:44:46] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
[23:44:56] <raj> last thing I saw u say, abjorn, is "otherise you're going to be wasting a lot script loading time"
[23:45:15] <abjorn> was the last thing i said so that's good
[23:45:23] <abjorn> hi gnarf
[23:45:57] <raj> the other issue is the dom elements aren't loaded till I use ajax to load the #content area, so in that case those particular js files/functions/lines are useless
[23:46:05] <gnarf> .seen abjorn 3
[23:46:05] <b-ot> gnarf, I saw abjorn 7m 19s ago, here in #jquery, saying: otherwise you're going to be wasting a lot of script loading time
[23:46:12] <gnarf> yup
[23:46:16] <gnarf> :)
[23:46:19] <raj> so I can't load those js files then, no?
[23:46:24] <abjorn> lol
[23:46:35] <abjorn> b-ot: you lie
[23:46:51] <tw2113> lies like a think that lies
[23:46:54] <tw2113> thing*
[23:46:57] <abjorn> ^
[23:47:22] <raj> abjorn, how do I circumvent that?
[23:47:58] <abjorn> well
[23:48:06] <abjorn> how I'd suggest managing your shit is uh
[23:48:13] <abjorn> requirejs for script loading
[23:48:41] <abjorn> for each page have init and uninit functions that bind and unbind your handlers
[23:48:47] <jrockjiggz> How can I debug what is causing my browser viewport to scroll up a few lines on an html() replacement? it could be the ajax request aswell.. but i can't see anything in code that is related to scroll
[23:49:49] <abjorn> out of curiousity, raj, what are you doing with your sockjs connection that you absolutely must keep it open?
[23:50:43] <jrockjiggz> if my browser is scroll down, and I replace HTML with greater content, the viewport still jumps up
[23:50:47] <raj> private messaging basically
[23:51:02] <raj> and other stuff, but the messaging is most imp
[23:51:12] <raj> for the steady cnxn
[23:51:23] <abjorn> well
[23:51:40] <abjorn> if that's the case it would be much, much easier to approach that from a different angle at this point
[23:51:51] <raj> such as?
[23:51:58] <abjorn> save your state outside of the socket connection so that when you dc/rc you can pick up where you left off
[23:52:11] <abjorn> you won't have to rewrite all your front end lol
[23:52:14] <raj> i tried, it's pretty ugle
[23:52:19] <raj> ugly
[23:52:34] <abjorn> yeah trust me I know how ugly it can get, but if you do it right it can work very well
[23:52:39] <raj> users don't expect a refresh
[23:53:00] <raj> i remember being pissed of when fb used to have a refresh
[23:53:00] <abjorn> I have an API I've been making for work that allows you to do everything through both restful requests and socketio :|
[23:53:07] <abjorn> not easy to share that state it's a bitch
[23:53:08] <coldhead> users don't expect anything but the constant delights of facebook
[23:55:00] <raj> so basically, I'll have to rewrite my site function by function to do this correctly
[23:55:08] <raj> as in, copy and paste my functions
[23:55:14] <abjorn> well that or you get frankensteins monster
[23:55:24] <raj> right
[23:55:29] <raj> omg
[23:55:34] <raj> i'm actually gonna do this
[23:55:43] <abjorn> point being, if you want it to work it's going to be an annoying undertaking
[23:55:59] <abjorn> did someone just suddenly jump a chat feature on you near the end or something? rofl
[23:56:00] <raj> additionally, people without js can't use the site
[23:56:06] <abjorn> yeeeaah
[23:56:21] <raj> #html is gonna kill me
[23:56:44] <abjorn> If you design it with all this stuff in mind from the beginning you can make it so the site will still work without JS, you just won't get a chat feature. But at this point that might be very difficult for you :|
[23:57:00] <raj> i agree
[23:57:12] <raj> what's it take to do that, out of curiosity?
[23:57:28] <abjorn> basically you make it work without writing any JS at first
[23:57:34] <abjorn> then write the JS to enhance it
[23:57:39] <raj> i've done that
[23:57:40] <abjorn> progressive enhancement, yo
[23:57:42] <abjorn> yeah
[23:57:43] <abjorn> it's eays
[23:57:45] <abjorn> easy, even
[23:58:12] <raj> ok, guess I could still do it
[23:58:14] <nights> if i return a new dom element (a dropdown) as an ajax response , what do i need to do to bind a change event to that new dom element?
[23:58:22] <raj> if I just return None on the links
[23:58:27] <nights> doesnt seem to react as it is now.
[23:58:37] <raj> i heard crawlers can now crawl with js sites too
[23:59:11] <nights> raj: its still quite lame..
[23:59:17] <nights> google just want to scare you.
[23:59:33] <phiz> nights: on
[23:59:34] <raj> that's not scary, that'd be great
[23:59:45] <nights> phiz: on?
[23:59:46] <nights> :S
