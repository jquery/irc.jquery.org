[00:25:43] <WillPittenger> Is there a way to select text nodes using JQuery?
[00:28:10] <grafi> sure, but its messy
[00:29:00] <WillPittenger> What's involved?
[00:31:54] <floatingpoint> how would I go about ensuring that an event occurs whenever a click on an element or its children occurs?
[00:34:45] <WillPittenger> grafi: ???
[00:35:34] <grafi> http://api.jquery.com/contents/ @ WillPittenger
[00:35:38] <grafi> look at the examples
[00:36:46] <WillPittenger> grafi: Thanks.
[00:40:15] <johngilbrough> I'm working on an autocomplete thing and one of my identical servers is returning the source code of the server side logic while the rest work find and return the autocomplete data.  What could possibly cause this?
[00:43:36] <slikts> how can I test if jquery collection is contained in an another collection?
[00:44:02] <slikts> like $('bla').contains($('anoterbla'))
[00:45:11] <Cork> slikts: $first.not($other)
[00:45:23] <Cork> slikts: $first.not($other).length if you want how many isn't in the second one
[00:45:26] <floatingpoint> how would I go about ensuring that an event occurs whenever a click on an element or its children occurs?
[00:45:37] <slikts> Cork: thanx
[00:46:02] <Cork> slikts: you can use .filter instead if you want it the other way around
[00:46:27] <slikts> Cork: it's exactly what I wanted, thank
[00:46:34] <slikts> such useful
[00:54:28] <WillPittenger> New problem: I'm want $("div").filter() to filter some divs that have 0 width.  With normal DOM elements, I can call .getBoudingClientRect().width.  But JQuery elements are different.  Is there a way to get the computed width from them?
[00:55:18] <floatingpoint> how would I match both an element and all its children?
[01:01:13] <floatingpoint> very helpful
[01:04:22] <zquad> is array.slice( ) destructive? Does it change the array?
[01:06:06] <Cork> zquad: no
[01:06:13] <Cork> ?mdn array.slice
[01:06:14] <b-ot> Cork: Array.prototype.slice() - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice
[01:06:21] <Cork> zquad: splice is though
[01:08:02] <Cork> WillPittenger: $('div').filter(function() { return $(this).width() > 0; })
[01:08:26] <Cork> WillPittenger: or $('div').filter(function() { return this.getBoudingClientRect().width > 0; }) if you prefer that
[01:09:07] <WillPittenger> Cork: I thought this would be a JQuery class rather than a DOM Node.
[01:09:17] <Cork> nope
[01:09:26] <Cork> this in a filter or each loop is the dom element
[01:09:42] <Cork> same as in event handlers
[01:10:54] <Cork> heh http://dilbert.com/dyn/str_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/200000/00000/6000/400/206403/206403.strip.gif
[01:14:34] <grafi> great one Cork ^^
[01:17:44] <zquad> thanks guys, works
[01:39:27] <WillPittenger> Now I'm getting an error that $().has isn't a function.  Any ideas?
[01:40:44] <WillPittenger> No semi-colon on the previous line. :p
[01:41:15] <WillPittenger> But something else is bothering it.
[01:45:06] <Cork> WillPittenger: code please
[01:45:19] <WillPittenger> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js
[01:45:24] <WillPittenger> :p
[01:45:26] <WillPittenger> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js
[01:45:37] <WillPittenger> $(".thumbInfo A").has("IMG[src=\"/images/previewOff.gif\"]").remove();
[01:45:39] <WillPittenger> There.
[01:47:20] <Cork> i din't see any problem with that line
[01:47:53] <Cork> but.. 1.3.2 that is quite old
[01:48:16] <Cork> and ya
[01:48:19] <Cork> too old for has
[01:48:25] <Cork> has was added in 1.4
[01:49:31] <Cork> WillPittenger: if you can i would recommend moving up to 1.9 or 1.10
[01:49:46] <WillPittenger> $(".thumbInfo A").has("IMG[src=\"/images/previewOff.gif\"]").remove();
[01:50:01] <WillPittenger> use http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9/jquery.min.js ?
[01:50:07] <Cork> ya
[01:50:48] <Cork> or http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.9.2/jquery-ui.min.js
[01:50:55] <Cork> opps that was ui....
[01:51:02] <WillPittenger> Several inches of snow outside.
[01:52:03] <Cork> WillPittenger: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js is the latest one
[01:54:02] <WillPittenger> Well, no exceptions anymore.  But the window.alert I added to tell me how many elements were found by has isn't popping up.
[01:54:28] <Cork> don't use alert for debugging
[01:54:33] <WillPittenger> window.alert($(".thumbInfo A").has("IMG[src=\"/images/previewOff.gif\"]").size());
[01:54:35] <Cork> use console.log
[01:54:43] <Cork> also use length not size()
[01:54:58] <Cork> size is deprecated (and pointless)
[01:55:36] <WillPittenger> Nothing.
[01:55:56] <Cork> console.log($(".thumbInfo A").has("IMG[src=\"/images/previewOff.gif\"]").length) gives you nothing in the console?
[01:56:43] <Cork> wait
[01:56:50] <Cork> oh, now i see
[01:56:51] <WillPittenger> Not unless firebug's console is wrong.
[01:56:56] <Cork> Willis: has doen't work like that
[01:56:58] <Cork> opps
[01:57:00] <Cork> *WillPittenger:
[01:57:20] <Cork> has check if the element you have selected matches the selector
[01:57:23] <Cork> ?api has
[01:57:24] <b-ot> Cork: .has(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[01:57:47] <Cork> and as none of your "a" elements matches "img" nothing will be in the result
[01:57:52] <WillPittenger> You get another set don't you?
[01:57:57] <Cork> sure
[01:58:02] <Cork> but it will be empty
[01:58:17] <Cork> [a,a,a,a].has('img') => []
[01:58:26] <Cork> [a,a,img,a].has('img') => [img]
[01:58:28] <WillPittenger> I thought has would be matching against the A's children.
[01:58:33] <Cork> no
[01:58:38] <Cork> you need to use filter for that
[01:59:35] <Cork> $(".thumbInfo A").filter(function() { return $(this).find('img[src="/images/previewOff.gif"]').length > 0; })
[02:00:06] <WillPittenger> Trying that.
[02:00:21] <Cork> a better option might be to do
[02:00:45] <Cork> $(".thumbInfo A img[src="/images/previewOff.gif"]").closest('a')
[02:01:34] <Cork> opps
[02:01:37] <Cork> wrong quotes
[02:01:44] <Cork> $('.thumbInfo A img[src="/images/previewOff.gif"]').closest('a')
[02:01:58] <WillPittenger> I caught that and you didn't backslash the other quotes.
[02:02:13] <Cork> WillPittenger: you don't need to if you use "" in side ''
[02:02:27] <Cork> or the other way around
[02:04:02] <WillPittenger> Has no effect >>> $(".thumbInfo A img[src=\"/images/previewOff.gif\"]").closest("a").remove();
[02:05:23] <WillPittenger> Nothing shows up in the Firebug console when I do console.log($(".thumbInfo A img[src=\"/images/previewOff.gif\"]").closest("a").length);
[02:09:31] <Cork> WillPittenger: http://jsfiddle.net/8ts6p/1/
[02:28:37] <WillPittenger> Cork: Does the console need to be enabled from a script?  I'm seeing an error that the page has disabled the console.  But the page itself has no scripts.
[02:28:56] <Cork> WillPittenger: nope
[02:29:22] <Cork> you might need to reload the page
[02:29:26] <WillPittenger> Well, as is, it's like the actual $ call doesn't run.
[02:29:28] <WillPittenger> I did.
[02:29:39] <WillPittenger> It's a Scriptish script.
[02:31:48] <Cork> WillPittenger: remember that scriptish scripts run in chrome so if you want to modify the dom you need to inject the scripts there
[02:32:47] <WillPittenger> It works somewhat.  I can edit links.  I stripped out ccbill.com junk.
[02:37:00] <zulcc> asume you ->fetch_array'ing data sets from a database. each set contains about 6 fields. you want to list them all, offering deletion or alteration of each set. if you use one <form> for each set, while trying to bind .ajaxForm to these forms, how do you circumvent double-id problems?
[02:38:04] <zulcc> or do you put them all in one big form that you .ajaxForm on, and separate which set to treat with an id within the $_POST name field?
[02:38:33] <WillPittenger> Cork: I tried both console.log and window.alert.  Neither gives me a value for $(".thumbInfo A img[src=\"/images/previewOff.gif\"]").length --or even executes that line.
[02:39:17] <Cork> WillPittenger: and your sure your loading jquery in the script?
[02:39:39] <WillPittenger> Cork: Yes.  The line that removes the ccbill.com junk uses it.
[02:39:59] <Cork> i always go native when i write those so don't know what exactly is needed to get it working
[02:49:34] <WillPittenger> I don't know what you mean by native.  The DOM?
[02:50:56] <Cork> native js and pure dom yes
[02:51:19] <Cork> document.querySelectorAll makes that easy enough
[03:27:05] <WillPittenger> Cork: Doesn't seem to be a way to debug my Scriptish script. :\
[03:27:25] <Cork> WillPittenger: should be
[03:27:35] <aMoniker> Is there a way to use addEventListener to receive jQuery events?
[03:27:50] <Cork> aMoniker: no
[03:28:06] <Cork> jquery faked events doesn't use the doms even system
[03:28:39] <aMoniker> In that case, is there a simple way to trigger an event (to be received by addEventListener) that's cross-browser compatible?
[03:29:22] <WillPittenger> Cork: Neither the built-in debugger nor Firebug show my script.
[03:30:02] <Cork> aMoniker: you could run the event command on the element directly
[03:30:13] <Cork> $('div')[0].click()
[03:30:22] <Cork> will trigger a click on the element
[03:30:34] <Cork> and it will be a normal click event
[03:30:37] <aMoniker> Cork: jquery isn't available yet, so I'm using native event listeners
[03:31:02] <Cork> well [0] means work on the raw dom element
[03:31:21] <aMoniker> Cork: that would work, but I don't want a real event :\
[03:31:40] <Cork> WillPittenger: remember that chrome code sees console differently then content
[03:31:58] <Cork> aMoniker: then your a bit out of luck
[03:32:11] <aMoniker> Cork: My luck is inexhaustible.
[03:32:12] <WillPittenger> Cork: Then I don't know how to debug.
[03:32:57] <Cork> WillPittenger: try unsafeWindow.console.log()
[03:35:30] <Cork> WillPittenger: though... console.log works fine here (in nightly at least)
[03:35:49] <WillPittenger> Still won't show.
[03:35:59] <Cork> check the browser console
[03:36:07] <Cork> might be it only ends up there for you
[03:36:23] <Cork> ctrl+shift+j
[03:36:26] <WillPittenger> I'm in the built-in debugger now.  Isn't it the same?
[03:36:31] <Cork> no
[03:39:17] <WillPittenger> I don't know.  That appears to overflow.  Searching for a string I put in the output turns up nothing.
[03:39:39] <Cork> then clear it and try again
[03:39:45] <WillPittenger> I tried.
[03:41:53] <WillPittenger> Is there a way to limit what's it showing to the current tab?  It's showing things for tons of tabs.
[03:42:28] <WillPittenger> And I'd rather step through the code.
[04:04:11] <Cork> WillPittenger: well something is eating your log info then; not sure why
[04:06:26] <WillPittenger> Cork: Scratchpad gives me the error "Exception: missing ) after argument list", but no line number.  What should I look for?  And why don't I see an exception in Firebug?
[04:06:55] <Cork> donno
[04:07:44] <Cork> well it is an unclosed parenthesis but can't tell you more then that
[04:24:04] <WillPittenger> Cork: Well, I found an extra parenthesis on one line and a missing comma on another line (in a parameter list).  But I still find no console messages.
[04:33:26] <WillPittenger> Cork: I'm beginning to think the version of the script that is actually being run isn't the one I'm saving.

[08:09:58] <kiki67100> I use a php script who called by a ajax request, my php script must do running in background how can I get the statut code of the request before the end of the request ?
[08:10:13] <kiki67100> i use flush() in php to send my first bit

[08:22:48] <AlbinoGeek> Hello, I am using jQuery and regular javascript interchangedly in working on a new project.  I'm currently trying to work out a sane way to handle callbacks for jQuery functions, such as $.get(url, formdata, callback) ; where it seems the callback function does not have access to either url nor formdata, only the returned data.
[08:22:55] <AlbinoGeek> How am I meant to pass data into that callback?
[08:25:25] <rue> Just in general terms, you can simply use them from a closure
[08:26:39] <rue> $.get(url, data, function (jqXhr) { console.log(url); } )
[08:27:16] <AlbinoGeek> rue: Erm, where'a good jspastebin ?  (I've got an example that doesn't work as you'd say above.)
[08:28:39] <rindolf> AlbinoGeek: there's jsfiddle
[08:30:07] <AlbinoGeek> Thanks, posting...
[08:32:56] <AlbinoGeek> Also, how are you meant to send arguments to a setTimeout callback, or otherwise schedule a periodic event?

[11:59:47] <trenton> lol

[12:00:19] <trenton> so about this jquery stuff...

[12:22:08] <felixjet_> why this doesnt work? newDiv.find('textarea').hasClass('error').removeClass('error');
[12:22:18] <felixjet_> if the textarea doesnt have class="error", im getting an exception
[12:23:45] <grafi> the exception being?
[12:28:44] <felixjet_> it works if i do if ($....$.hasClass('error')) { $....$.removeClass('error')
[12:28:47] <felixjet_> but not chaining methods
[12:29:04] <felixjet_> its supposedly to work?
[12:30:31] <grafi> i think hasClass returns a boolean, so you probably cant chain after that ... why not just .find('textarea.error').removeClass('error') ?
[12:33:24] <felixjet_> grafi, but on the docs they chain it
[12:33:31] <felixjet_> and yes, it returns a boolean
[12:33:43] <grafi> so how would you chain a bool?
[12:33:51] <felixjet_> dont know, ask the ones that made the docs? xD
[12:34:03] <felixjet_> http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[12:34:07] <felixjet_> $( "#result1" ).append( $( "p:first" ).hasClass( "selected" ).toString() );
[12:34:35] <felixjet_> if i do removeclass only, without checking if the element have the class, its not a bad practice?
[12:35:24] <grafi> .find('textarea.error').removeClass('error') finds only textareas with errors to begin with
[12:35:29] <grafi> so no problem there
[12:36:41] <floatingpoint> what is the best way to search through an element's children and remove a class?
[12:36:49] <duckgoose> felixjet_ it's a....
[12:36:51] <duckgoose> bad habbit....
[12:37:24] <felixjet_> grafi, ah, but anyway i have to chain more things
[12:37:28] <duckgoose> jquery will handle it fine, but something else down the road might not
[12:37:34] <felixjet_> to every textarea, not only the ones with 'error'
[12:37:40] <felixjet_> so i think hasclass is better here
[12:38:29] <grafi> only that its not working
[12:38:30] <grafi> ^^
[12:38:49] <grafi> so whats the other thing you want to do?
[12:39:07] <duckgoose> ha
[12:39:08] <duckgoose> yea
[12:39:24] <floatingpoint> will something like myParentElement.children().removeClass('active'); remove the 'active' class from any children?
[12:39:28] <duckgoose> using a selector to just as good at making sure the class is there
[12:39:43] <duckgoose> -to+is
[12:41:05] <duckgoose> myParentElement.find(".active").removeClass('active');
[12:41:23] <duckgoose> myParentElement.find('.active').removeClass('active');  ******
[12:41:37] <floatingpoint> duckgoose will that match multiple child elements?
[12:41:50] <duckgoose> all the ones with active class
[12:50:41] <floatingpoint> duckgoose and then how would I update the css of all child elements (regardless of class)
[12:55:18] <grafi> myParentElement.children().css().end().find('.active').removeClass('active')
[12:55:19] <grafi> blub
[13:10:01] <johngilbrough> I have two servers that I believe are identical.  When I do an jquery ajax request on one, I get the json results I expect.  When I do the same request on the other server, it returns the python source code rather than the json it's supposed to generate.  I've reinstalled libapache2-mod-wsgi but the problem persists.  Has anyone got a clue as to what might be going on here?
[13:10:54] <grafi> at this point this doesnt sound like a jquery problem anymore ^^
[13:25:25] <johngilbrough> But I was hoping that you folks might have run into and solved this kind of thing :)
[13:26:21] <shoky> javalover: hi
[13:31:37] <s5fs> johngilbrough: sounds like your web server isn't configured to execute the python, and is just sending them out as static files
[13:32:48] <s5fs> johngilbrough: i don't do python work, but you want to do something along these lines: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-mod_python-apache-tutorial/
[13:39:02] <johngilbrough> s5fs: We're using mod_wsgi which is what gives us the apache/python bridge.  It's been working for years including the ajax business.  So what's weird is that we have to identical servers and one returns json like it should and the other is returning the python source.
[13:40:45] <shoky> are you sure all the apache configuration is identical..?
[13:43:53] <s5fs> johngilbrough: gotcha, i haven't used wsgi but it appears to work just like any other apache mod. here's another link, ensure the modules are in place and you are loading it, etc. http://grok.zope.org/documentation/tutorial/installing-and-setting-up-grok-under-mod-wsgi/installing-and-configuring-mod-wsgi

[16:47:50] <Starcraftmazter> grafi: they're just 3 images
[16:47:52] <Starcraftmazter> one transparent
[16:47:57] <Starcraftmazter> one is the background gray
[16:48:01] <Starcraftmazter> and the other is the purple bar
[16:48:04] <Starcraftmazter> all of the same size
[16:48:19] <Starcraftmazter> sorry i dont have them right now >< they're on another computer
[16:49:10] <grafi> make the purple stuff 1px wide, set it as background to a div, background to repeat
[16:49:22] <grafi> then set the width of the div?
[16:49:59] <grafi> aleray whats that a css question?
[16:50:23] <aleray> grafi, no a jquery filter question
[16:50:59] <Starcraftmazter> grafi: but also how do i deal with the curves on the edges?
[16:51:16] <grafi> use less images and more css probably
[16:51:25] <grafi> border-radius can do that very easily
[16:51:51] <Starcraftmazter> yeh
[16:51:54] <Starcraftmazter> but they also have a gradient
[16:52:22] <grafi> the edges?
[16:52:27] <Starcraftmazter> no the bar itself
[16:52:30] <Starcraftmazter> from top to bottom
[16:53:04] <grafi> the purple thing, yes
[16:56:47] <grafi> Starcraftmazter http://jsfiddle.net/vMW53/2/
[16:56:50] <grafi> something like this
[17:13:46] <shoky> aleray: collection.not(function() { return $(this).parents().is('section') })
[17:14:38] <aleray> shoky, nice.
[17:14:54] <shoky> can also use collection.not('section heading') tho possibly thats worse performance wise
[17:15:01] <Starcraftmazter> grafi: thats pretty cool, how can i make it go from the other direction>
[17:15:04] <Starcraftmazter> or wait
[17:15:05] <Starcraftmazter> rather
[17:15:12] <Starcraftmazter> it needs to be full to begin with and then get lower from the left
[17:15:18] <aleray> shoky, I will replace parents with parentsuntil
[17:16:05] <aleray> shoky, so you advise to go for for the first example?
[17:16:08] <aleray> right?
[17:17:13] <shoky> aleray: yeah. either way would probably be fine tho, would need to know more bout what you're doing and see some code to give a better answer
[17:18:12] <shoky> could also go with:  return $(this).closest('section').length;
[17:18:56] <aleray> I will modify this: https://github.com/dcneiner/TableOfContents/blob/master/js/jquery.tableofcontents.js after line 77
[17:20:14] <shoky> oks.. not really gonna read that ;p
[17:20:50] <grafi> Starcraftmazter then you just start off with 100% width
[17:23:48] <Starcraftmazter> grafi: what does this do?         transition: width .3s ease-in-out 0s;
[17:24:25] <grafi> "animates" when the width goes from one width to another, so its not instant but grows
[17:25:51] <Starcraftmazter> grafi: cool, one last thing, when its in the middle, is there a way to make it also curved ?
[17:25:55] <Starcraftmazter> as in border radius
[17:26:20] <Starcraftmazter> o wait thats a stupid question
[17:26:21] <Starcraftmazter> nvm
[17:26:24] <Starcraftmazter> got it
[17:26:26] <Starcraftmazter> THANKS
[17:26:27] <grafi> just apply the radius on the bar ^^
[17:26:56] <Starcraftmazter> css is PRETTY cool these days isnt it
[17:27:35] <grafi> its getting there
[17:27:36] <grafi> :P
[17:37:50] <Starcraftmazter> thanks again grafi, got it working 100% as i want it
[17:37:51] <Starcraftmazter> :D
[17:38:06] <grafi> cool
[17:50:43] <dekiss> is tehere some page with premade form templates?
[18:16:19] <d1rkp1tt> anyone able to tell me what this does?
[18:16:20] <d1rkp1tt>  this.action += (this.action.indexOf('?') == -1 ? '?' : '&') + 'X-Progress-ID=' + uuid;
[18:16:36] <d1rkp1tt> I know that it appends progress id and my generated uuid
[18:16:45] <d1rkp1tt> but the index of confuses me
[18:17:07] <d1rkp1tt> I want to try and add &callback=? to the end in an attempt to get IE9 to play ball
[18:17:20] <grafi> oO
[18:17:38] <d1rkp1tt> I have tried this.action += (this.action.indexOf('?') == -1 ? '?' : '&') + 'X-Progress-ID=' + uuid + '&callback=?';
[18:17:45] <grafi> it checks if ? is present if not append ? otherwise append &
[18:18:09] <grafi> becuase you have urls like indenx.html?id=123&time=blub
[18:18:37] <grafi> whats the ? at the end?
[18:18:39] <shoky> &callback=? is for jsonp urls
[18:18:40] <grafi> callback=?
[18:18:44] <grafi> p^p
[18:19:02] <shoky> doesn't really make IE9 do anything
[18:19:14] <shoky> and only works if the server supports JSONP
[18:19:18] <d1rkp1tt> I heard IE wont make a JSON call unless it has tha
[18:19:20] <d1rkp1tt> t
[18:19:21] <grafi> maybe it makes IE crash
[18:19:23] <grafi> :D
[18:19:30] <shoky> d1rkp1tt that's bullcrap
[18:19:32] <d1rkp1tt> Its working on chrome and firefox
[18:19:47] <shoky> d1rkp1tt the server has to support JSONP otherwise that will not work
[18:20:15] <shoky> what's "this" btw..
[18:20:32] <d1rkp1tt> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15645324/json-jquery-getjson-doesnt-work-in-ie8-ie9
[18:20:53] <d1rkp1tt> hmm
[18:20:56] <d1rkp1tt> running django
[18:21:05] <d1rkp1tt> on apache
[18:21:10] <d1rkp1tt> with wsgi
[18:21:16] <shoky> d1rkp1tt you don't need this
[18:21:19] <shoky> don't do JSONP
[18:21:28] <shoky> configure your django/apache to support CORS
[18:21:38] <shoky> ?g support cors
[18:21:40] <b-ot> shoky: jQuery.support | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
[18:21:42] <shoky> eh
[18:21:53] <shoky> `g support cors
[18:21:54] <b-ot> shoky: jQuery.support | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
[18:22:10] <shoky> `g enable cors
[18:22:11] <b-ot> shoky: enable cross-origin resource sharing → http://enable-cors.org/
[18:22:16] <shoky> d1rkp1tt ^
[18:22:33] <d1rkp1tt> ok so I dont even know if thats the issue yet
[18:22:36] <d1rkp1tt> Im doing a file upload
[18:22:37] <shoky> d1rkp1tt sorry,
[18:22:51] <d1rkp1tt> so I send the file through an iframe
[18:22:59] <shoky> uh
[18:23:00] <d1rkp1tt> then make a call to check progress
[18:23:10] <shoky> then adding callback=? definitely won't help..
[18:23:19] <d1rkp1tt> Iframe is a dirty workaround for browser blocking while uploading
[18:23:22] <d1rkp1tt> ok
[18:23:32] <d1rkp1tt> so chome = good, firefox = good
[18:23:35] <d1rkp1tt> but IE..
[18:23:40] <d1rkp1tt> in the dev toolbar
[18:23:45] <d1rkp1tt> it shows it making a call
[18:23:51] <shoky> what's the request.. a getJSON ?
[18:23:51] <d1rkp1tt> Servers not seeing it
[18:24:00] <d1rkp1tt> yes
[18:24:11] <d1rkp1tt> it does '1' call
[18:24:15] <shoky> ok, do you know if your server supports CORS ?
[18:24:25] <d1rkp1tt> but is supposed to repeat every second until the files uploaded
[18:24:26] <shoky> i think it does, already
[18:24:32] <d1rkp1tt> not sure
[18:24:39] <d1rkp1tt> havent heard of that
[18:24:41] <shoky> in which case you need to include: https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[18:24:54] <shoky> which allows IE8-9 to use CORS
[18:25:05] <d1rkp1tt> Its a default apache2 install
[18:25:19] <shoky> but that's only if your server is alrady CORS enabled
[18:25:32] <shoky> it'd be in django most likely
[18:25:39] <d1rkp1tt> hmm
[18:25:48] <d1rkp1tt> does that open some security holes?
[18:25:56] <shoky> actually could be in apache adunno
[18:26:06] <shoky> it might..
[18:26:46] <d1rkp1tt> okay, well that gives me something to research.. thanks for that
[18:27:06] <shoky> check the request in chrome devtools
[18:27:10] <shoky> the one that doesn't work in IE
[18:27:33] <shoky> check the response headers for that, see if there's one that looks like Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[18:27:48] <d1rkp1tt> ok
[18:28:01] <shoky> if not, then the problem is something else
[18:28:16] <shoky> guess i should've asked this first... is this a cross-origin request ;]
[18:30:45] <Cache_Money2> is there a preference to either of these:  $(this.parentNode)  or $(this).parent()  ?
[18:30:56] <d1rkp1tt> I dont see it in my response header
[18:31:27] <shoky> d1rkp1tt is this a cross-origin request?
[18:31:38] <shoky> what does the .getJSON call look like
[18:31:48] <d1rkp1tt> will dpaste my whole file
[18:32:09] <d1rkp1tt> https://dpaste.de/UWdd
[18:33:21] <d1rkp1tt> hmm just did the same thing in my ubuntu version of firefox
[18:33:25] <d1rkp1tt> 1 hit then fail
[18:33:38] <shoky> d1rkp1tt: it's the getJSON that isn't working?  that has nothing to do with the this.action thing you pasted..
[18:33:57] <shoky> the getJSON isn't cross-origin, so you can forget about cors/jsonp/callback=?
[18:34:37] <d1rkp1tt> ok
[18:35:06] <d1rkp1tt> difficult to work out, because its fine in chrome and firefox
[18:35:44] <d1rkp1tt> oh firefox may have cried because I added the callback while testing
[18:36:06] <shoky> many people just use  http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[18:37:02] <grafi> too easy really
[18:37:12] <d1rkp1tt> actually no it seems I have killed it on all browsers now
[18:37:14] <grafi> wheres the fun in that shoky
[18:37:47] <shoky> wasn't very easy the last time i tried it :S
[18:38:25] <d1rkp1tt> I been at this for like a week
[18:38:32] <d1rkp1tt> Finally got it working about an hour ago
[18:38:43] <d1rkp1tt> its not simple on the django side
[18:39:02] <d1rkp1tt> then browsers block ajax calls while the file is uploading
[18:39:09] <d1rkp1tt> hence the iframe messyness
[18:40:17] <d1rkp1tt> Heres the version that is working
[18:40:17] <d1rkp1tt> https://dpaste.de/2Rew
[18:40:22] <grafi> shoky wut
[18:40:23] <d1rkp1tt> In all but IE
[18:40:41] <shoky> d1rkp1tt heh you don't need that first .hide()
[18:40:48] <shoky> just fix your html: <iframe name="iframe-name" id="iframe-name" display:none;></iframe>
[18:41:02] <shoky> grafi aduno
[18:41:09] <grafi> arduino?
[18:41:10] <grafi> <:
[18:41:40] <d1rkp1tt> not sure whats wrong with that html
[18:41:47] <d1rkp1tt> hence the hide lol
[18:42:18] <shoky> is   ".?X-Progress-ID=..."   even a valid url
[18:42:25] <d1rkp1tt> style="visibility:hidden;display:none"
[18:42:32] <d1rkp1tt> yes
[18:42:40] <shoky> d1rkp1tt dont need the visiblit
[18:43:20] <d1rkp1tt> is   ".?X-Progress-ID=..."   even a valid url
[18:43:27] <d1rkp1tt> Thats why I asked about the action
[18:43:37] <d1rkp1tt> is   ".?X-Progress-ID=..."   is just query string parameters
[18:44:01] <shoky> it's the   .?  part that i'm not sure about
[18:44:36] <d1rkp1tt> neither... hence my first question
[18:44:43] <d1rkp1tt> the request URL looks fine though
[18:44:49] <d1rkp1tt> will paste whats hitting the server
[18:44:58] <shoky> i'd add that as a hidden input
[18:45:03] <shoky> instead of on the url
[18:45:19] <d1rkp1tt> HTTP/1.1" 304 209 "http://192.168.1.78:8080/uploadtest3/?X-Progress-ID=15be1a07d721dde35df98f523c23aca7"
[18:45:38] <shoky> oks.. IE9 says that too?
[18:45:57] <d1rkp1tt> IE9 is doing strange stuff
[18:46:01] <d1rkp1tt> will paste something from it
[18:46:04] <d1rkp1tt> oh
[18:46:05] <d1rkp1tt> cant
[18:46:08] <d1rkp1tt> hmm
[18:46:13] <d1rkp1tt> im in ubuntu VM
[18:46:15] <d1rkp1tt> haha
[18:46:21] <grafi> lol
[18:46:22] <d1rkp1tt> two ticks
[18:46:36] <shoky> portforward 8080 ;p
[18:47:04] <shoky> o wait i updatd my IE9 last week nvm
[18:47:21] <d1rkp1tt> but yeah IE9 looks the same.. but I dont get server logs
[18:47:38] <shoky> IE9 says it's making the request?
[18:47:52] <shoky> a POST to that url?
[18:47:54] <d1rkp1tt> it does
[18:48:03] <d1rkp1tt> but I dont really believe it yet
[18:48:19] <d1rkp1tt> it says its getting a response as well
[18:50:02] <d1rkp1tt> grrr
[18:50:26] <d1rkp1tt> so yeah it says its working, but Im not getting any logs
[18:50:44] <d1rkp1tt> oh wait
[18:51:00] <d1rkp1tt> I did pump out a bunch of logs into another logging file from my server side code
[18:51:08] <d1rkp1tt> which showed it hitting once... then doing nothing
[18:52:07] <d1rkp1tt> funny thing is.. it gives me this request body
[18:53:01] <d1rkp1tt> time for fiddler
[18:53:47] <d1rkp1tt> ahah.. fiddler says IE's network monitor is full of shit
[18:53:52] <d1rkp1tt> excuse my french
[18:53:53] <d1rkp1tt> lol
[18:55:58] <d1rkp1tt> its almost like windows.timeout is not working for IE
[18:56:14] <d1rkp1tt> windows.setTimeout
[18:58:31] <d1rkp1tt> So  do I need to worry about the CORS thing do you think?
[18:58:34] <shoky> if you got a live link i'd be happy to take a look
[18:58:50] <shoky> no, CORS is only for cross-domain ajax
[18:58:55] <d1rkp1tt> ok
[18:59:07] <shoky> (and so is JSONP which is that callback=? thing..)
[18:59:20] <d1rkp1tt> ok thanks
[18:59:42] <d1rkp1tt> Is it typical how I have created the iframe?
[18:59:59] <shoky> think so
[19:00:12] <shoky> if you fixed the style thing
[19:00:20] <d1rkp1tt> yeah I did
[19:00:36] <d1rkp1tt> I previously had an issue where my request was mismatching the cached data
[19:00:48] <d1rkp1tt> because it was running in a different process on the second request
[19:00:55] <d1rkp1tt> So I installed memcached
[19:01:03] <d1rkp1tt> which handles it differently
[19:01:58] <shoky> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[19:02:13] <d1rkp1tt> nice
[19:02:42] <d1rkp1tt> ok, Ill bench it for now, and start doing a bunch of console logs later and see if I can see where IE falls over
[19:02:46] <d1rkp1tt> Thanks for your time...
[19:02:58] <shoky> ya more logging would indeed help
[19:03:00] <shoky> np
[19:21:43] <grafi> console.log("shoky was here")
[19:46:12] <shoky> graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaafi

[20:39:49] <mrbubbles> good evening
[21:19:35] <d1rkp1tt> shoky, you still there?
[21:22:23] <doug65536> http connection: keep-alive is blocking my ajax requests when I use long polling
[21:23:34] <doug65536> I confirmed it by changing the apache config for the keepalive duration. if it's 60 seconds, then the request after the long poll is delayed by 60 seconds. if I change the keep alive to 5 seconds, the request after the long poll takes for 5 seconds
[21:23:42] <d1rkp1tt> shoky, Just reporting back.. the solution to my problem was... $.ajaxSetup({ cache: false });
[21:24:07] <d1rkp1tt> IE was chaching the first response from ajax
[21:24:41] <doug65536> is there a way to make xhr not use the persistent connection it already has?
[21:25:28] <d1rkp1tt> what are you trying to do?
[21:26:00] <doug65536> me?
[21:27:18] <doug65536> browsers don't implement HTTP pipelining, so my long poll ties up the persistent connection for the duration of the keepalive connection
[21:28:11] <doug65536> both chrome and firefox will block for the keepalive duration, and only after that time expires will they open a new connection and send the next request
[21:28:38] <doug65536> I tried using a subdomain for the long polling but it didn't seem to work
[21:28:56] <doug65536> the thinking was, it would use a separate persistent connection for a different domain
[21:30:39] <grafi> wohoooo
[21:30:52] <grafi> I know what I want for christmas
[21:30:55] <grafi> :]
[21:31:53] <tw2113> $() ?
[21:31:55] <d1rkp1tt> doug65536, Is that similiar to the issue I just had.. trying to poll the upload progress in chrome, but unable to make an ajax call because its blocked?
[21:32:17] <doug65536> d1rkp1tt: yes
[21:32:38] <doug65536> d1rkp1tt: blocked for the keepalive=x time (x in seconds)
[21:32:54] <doug65536> because it is trying to reuse the existing persistent connection
[21:33:08] <doug65536> it's not session_write_close on the server side
[21:33:09] <d1rkp1tt> so my dirty trick was to post in an iframe and query outside of that
[21:34:31] <doug65536> d1rkp1tt: that worked? the iframe was from the same origin?
[21:34:42] <d1rkp1tt> Yeah
[21:34:51] <d1rkp1tt> Thats everyones hack by the looks
[21:35:01] <d1rkp1tt> well from what I hunted around for
[21:35:24] <d1rkp1tt> Just hid the iframe
[22:30:30] <ministry> Why is document.ready() function used?
[22:43:42] <d1rkp1tt> like you would run something .onclick .... or in jquery just .click   ... $(document).ready()
[22:43:59] <d1rkp1tt> whatever is in $(document).ready() runs when the page is "ready"
[22:44:17] <ministry> d1rkp1tt: It runs when the whole dom is stabilized?
[22:44:24] <d1rkp1tt> yes
[22:46:21] <d1rkp1tt> ministry .. codeacademy has some free and quick practical exercises to familiarize you with the basics
[22:46:32] <ministry> d1rkp1tt: I've done it.
[22:46:34] <ministry> I know the basics.
[22:47:07] <d1rkp1tt> ok ..
[22:51:46] <d1rkp1tt> I think that question was covered in intro : 7 as a refresher ;)
[23:41:35] <Cork> ministry: ready is a wrapper function around the browsers DOMContentLoaded event with a fallback to onload for browsers that doesn't support it
[23:42:12] <ministry> Cork: So basically the code under the ready function will not execute until the whole DOM is ready.
[23:42:18] <Cork> ministry: so it ensures that the body section of the file has been parsed before the js executes, so you can do dom lookups without worring about if the elements actually exist
[23:42:26] <Cork> ministry: exactly
[23:42:52] <Cork> ministry: not though, this is only for the normal page load
[23:43:02] <Cork> this does NOT work for ajax loads or similar
[23:43:10] <Cork> (a common mistake)
[23:46:13] <ministry> Cork: Thanks!
[23:48:20] <ministry> Cork: Are you a developer?
