[00:02:20] <sahbeewah> lonejack, don't think that is possible to do... in a nice way anyway
[00:04:54] <sahbeewah> here's a hack around: http://gregpettit.ca/2012/jquery-check-if-element-has-auto-widthheight/
[00:09:10] <lonejack> sahbeewah, thank you. I already saw this
[00:09:37] <lonejack> it works but isn't nice you're right
[00:10:30] <cloudgeek> I am using jquery resizeable ui, It's working in horizontal pan .. When I close to leftmost point it amlost close up side bar ... now again doing back to smae size I want to add some helper button or something that can do indication for reverting it back
[00:13:15] <cloudgeek> so can you suggest any plugin or api name
[00:13:23] <cloudgeek> that could me doing the same task
[00:54:51] <Stephen> evening all
[00:55:03] <Stephen> Working hard or hardly working?
[01:17:31] <raj> would it seem odd if someone clicked an X to close something, and it didn't close until websocket sent and received confirmation from the server?
[01:18:10] <raj> meaning, would the delay be odd?
[01:18:43] <xinming> Hi, In jq source, I saw there is a    function named 'define',  Where do I get the source for this function definition please?
[01:20:01] <cloudgeek> Here is a example ..after doing the leftmmost the sidebar.. there no way how I can switch back to sidebar...only whole area is main part only so ..I want point any tag revert back the sidebar ...http://jsfiddle.net/gaby/Bek9L/186/
[01:20:48] <raj> xinming, add a break in console, and then call define() and then step through?
[01:22:43] <xinming> raj: But the version is already minified.
[01:23:05] <raj> use an unminified version? :)
[01:23:43] <raj> from a CDN that is
[01:24:30] <xinming> Well
[01:24:33] <xinming> The strange thing is,
[01:24:35] <xinming> Oh,
[01:24:42] <xinming> Ok, Let me try again with a non-minified version
[01:25:00] <Stephen> cloudgeek: Just make sure and add some sort of progress indicator / mask
[01:25:22] <cloudgeek> http://jsfiddle.net/gaby/Bek9L/186/   ..I want a helper button or something else that can help me support here to remind the user after doing fully the ..tell me any api mehtod? to do the same
[01:26:19] <cloudgeek> Stephen: main issue .. if the sidebar is completely disapper after that how user can revert it back without refershing the page
[01:26:45] <cloudgeek> I am thining if I can tag something a notifier or pop
[01:27:30] <cloudgeek> like my logic is to write the a fuction that deal with the width of side ...
[01:27:43] <cloudgeek> like if width > 10px {}
[01:27:45] <xinming> raj: So, my question should be changed
[01:28:01] <xinming> raj: In source, there are a lot define([ ... ], function () { });
[01:28:05] <xinming> But in the cdn version of jquery
[01:28:11] <cloudgeek> else width < 10px then that action invoke or something else
[01:28:12] <xinming> I can see only none
[01:28:46] <xinming> I can see none
[01:28:49] <xinming> So, Why is that?
[01:31:26] <cloudgeek> http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/  when it reaches to the adaptive app search .. the same way I put any button there
[01:31:47] <raj> xinming, not sure what you're looking at with `define`, so can't say
[01:32:54] <xinming> raj: in src/core.js
[01:33:12] <xinming> there is     define([ ... ], function () { })  blabla
[01:33:19] <xinming> In the source repositroy
[01:33:49] <xinming> raj: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js
[01:34:25] <Stephen> Bah
[01:34:27] <Stephen> raj
[01:34:31] <Stephen> crosspost bro
[01:36:23] <cloudgeek> abbe koi help karo
[01:43:22] <raj> Stephen, sorry?
[01:43:42] <raj> meaning why did I ask that question here?
[01:43:46] <raj> cuz I asked that question here first
[01:44:02] <raj> gotta go where the action is
[02:17:03] <smolly> How do i stop a jquery script with a button on my site
[02:19:15] <snql> check and modify
[02:26:29] <smolly> snql: so there are't any easy fix?
[02:27:42] <doug65536> smolly: you're asking an XY question
[02:28:41] <smolly> doug65536: i just wanted to know if there was a command like stop jqeruy or something
[02:29:07] <Guest31904> bonjour, j'ai une question niveau débutant au sujet des index, si quelqu'un veut m'aider 3mn ^^
[02:30:38] <doug65536> smolly: scripts don't keep running like you are apparently imagining. the browser ui hangs while scrips run. to tell you how to stop whatever you want to stop, you would need to provide more than no information whatsoever about what the script does, and where you got it
[02:31:08] <smolly> doug65536: i can link you the script
[02:31:15] <smolly> if that makes an sense
[02:31:22] <doug65536> smolly: that would help
[02:32:11] <smolly> doug65536: http://www.jqueryscript.net/other/Realistic-Raindrops-Effect-with-Canvas-Rainyday-js.html
[02:35:06] <sasmit87> Hi all
[02:35:09] <doug65536> smolly: it looks like that script uses a youtube video. to stop it you can use the youtube player api https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference
[02:35:45] <smolly> doug65536: i don't think the youtube videos makes the raindrop, only the sound
[02:36:19] <doug65536> smolly: yes http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftu5ZpAk8dM
[02:36:59] <smolly> doug65536: its the raindrops i have problem with
[02:37:15] <sasmit87> I am using jquery validtae plugin to validate my form. however I am writing one custom method to check the email Id is already exists or not
[02:37:20] <sasmit87> here is my code
[02:37:21] <sasmit87> http://paste.ofcode.org/QKQtq7fViDMKMVZJ8tVgzy
[02:38:16] <doug65536> smolly: there is a clear function in RainyDay, that takes a parameter to make it stop
[02:39:02] <doug65536> smolly: engine.clear(true); will stop it
[02:39:23] <smolly> doug65536: thanks
[02:39:27] <smolly> doug65536: will try it
[02:39:39] <sasmit87> probleam is that before the success response comes its returning success
[02:40:07] <doug65536> smolly: you would need to declare var engine outside demo, or attach your event handler inside demo() where engine is in scope
[02:40:18] <sasmit87> any help
[03:20:23] <andywww> i have lightbox2 running as a standard plugin with the normal dom ready notation: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/84a5788ad1be7e6d62b8
[03:20:47] <andywww> i would like to modify that so it is a function that i can call rather than it loading on dom ready
[03:20:52] <andywww> how can i do this please?
[03:50:14] <sasmit87> can somebody help me
[03:50:37] <joroci> yea
[03:50:51] <joroci> also you can just ask no need to ask to ask :P
[03:51:51] <sasmit87> 	I am using jquery validtae plugin to validate my form. however I am writing one custom method to check the email Id is already exists or not
[03:51:57] <sasmit87> here is my code
[03:52:03] <sasmit87> http://paste.ofcode.org/QKQtq7fViDMKMVZJ8tVgzy
[03:52:20] <sasmit87> 	probleam is that before the success response comes its returning success
[03:53:06] <xinming> Anyone here knows about how is the jquery 'define' function implemented please?
[03:53:23] <xinming> I saw the source, we are calling 'define' method in each of the js source,
[03:53:35] <xinming> But I don't know the document for define function and what is used for
[03:57:16] <sahbeewah> sasmit87, yeah you can't do that because it's async. use the remote method in the plugin
[03:57:56] <sahbeewah> xinming, that's not a jquery thing, you're most likely looking at requirejs
[03:58:36] <sahbeewah> ---> #requirejs
[03:59:35] <xinming> sahbeewah: What is the relation between requirejs and jquery? As they are in jquery source repo
[04:01:16] <xinming> hmm, Seems to be a compiling tool for js
[04:01:19] <sahbeewah> requirejs organises your scripts into modules and allows you to load the scripts that you need for a particular page
[04:01:29] <sahbeewah> jquery is one such script
[04:02:41] <Stephen> xinming: define is not part of jquery
[04:02:46] <Stephen> it's part of requirejs
[04:02:47] <Stephen> http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#define
[04:03:11] <Stephen> It's used in the build process of jquery
[04:03:22] <Stephen> erg
[04:03:25] <Stephen> already answered
[04:03:28] <Stephen> my bad
[04:03:29] <sasmit87> sahbeewah: what is that remote method in the plugin
[04:05:40] <sahbeewah> sasmit87, http://jqueryvalidation.org/remote-method/
[04:05:53] <sahbeewah> the docs are very easy to read; you should read it
[04:43:31] <martz_> looking for a solution of transforming <section class="redbg"> into <section class="rebbg" data-background="images/redbg.png"> with jquery
[04:44:31] <joroci> $('.redbug').attr('data-background','images/redbg.png');

[04:48:59] <martz_> (anonymous function) tikal.js:9
[04:49:32] <martz_> im using reveal.js and jquery is already included but I keep getting & getting '$ is not defined' ...
[04:49:45] <Acrack> hello
[04:50:04] <joroci> try jQuery instead of $
[04:50:08] <Acrack> can someone tell me if i did something wrong trying to remove a value from an array ? http://jsfiddle.net/PH98P/1/
[04:50:46] <Acrack> i need 1 and 40 removed from they array "friends"
[04:51:37] <martz_> same thing jQuery not defined - and it's right there in the index.html "<script src="/js/libs/jquery/jquery-1.9.1.js"></script>" ...
[04:51:58] <joroci> Acrack the method is returning a new array with the the values removed
[04:52:08] <joroci> so do
[04:52:21] <joroci> friends = friends.slice...
[04:52:39] <joroci> martz  do you have a link?
[04:56:54] <martz_> on jsfiddle you snippet worked :)
[04:57:18] <joroci> i know
[04:57:28] <joroci> i guess the jquery file isn't loading properly
[04:57:35] <joroci> check it in the developer console
[04:58:18] <Acrack> joroci: it doesn't work like this
[04:58:34] <martz_> hmm ... i'm new to js but I guess you are referring to chrome dev tools ... im there and jquery shows up ...
[04:59:20] <joroci> do you have any errors?
[04:59:25] <joroci> or a link i can see?
[05:00:12] <martz_> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined modtik.js:1
[05:00:12] <martz_> (anonymous function)
[05:00:21] <martz_> that the error
[05:00:27] <martz_> its all local right now
[05:01:12] <Guest___> that's /js/blah/blah with the leading slash?
[05:03:58] <roryhughes> Do you guys think it's overkill to use angular instead of jquery here http://imageswaps.tk/
[05:04:45] <newbie_4D> hey ! can we get a page htlml  source using jQuery?
[05:05:58] <sammych_> I can do you one better
[05:06:00] <sammych_> document.documentElement.innerHTML
[05:07:05] <joroci> Acrack
[05:07:27] <Acrack> joroci its ok i had to convert int to string :D
[05:07:29] <joroci> yea
[05:07:33] <joroci> was gonna say that :)
[05:07:43] <Acrack> http://jsfiddle.net/PH98P/2/
[05:07:47] <joroci> yea
[05:07:47] <sammych_> I'm gonna do responsiveness via JS
[05:07:48] <Acrack> dunno if it is the best way tho
[05:08:06] <joroci> it's still a number
[05:08:22] <sammych_> window.onresize() and a stack of getBoundingClientRect()
[05:08:37] <sammych_> and a throttle
[05:09:12] <joroci> Acrack you can add your own method to remove items
[05:09:28] <Acrack> yes but this one is ok
[05:09:30] <Acrack> for now
[05:10:00] <joroci> yea just a bit more clear
[05:10:07] <joroci> like arr.remove(val)
[05:11:51] <sammych_> arr.splice(array.indexOf(val), 1)
[05:12:20] <joroci> same
[05:13:08] <martz_> @joroci, it worked like a charm, I had an error with loading jquery into reveal.js just changed the script position to the header ...
[05:13:30] <joroci> oooh
[05:13:41] <joroci> would be easier if i could see :)
[05:13:46] <joroci> but good
[05:13:53] <martz_> thanks alot
[05:14:06] <joroci> np
[05:59:01] <Anes> hi dear
[05:59:25] <Anes> do any one know how to create thumbnail for uploadify?
[05:59:56] <Anes> banis : any idea ?
[06:02:08] <Anes> no body here!!
[06:02:25] <joroci> some are here
[06:03:41] <gvo> Why is uploadify thumbnail generation different from any other thumbnail generation?
[06:07:00] <sammych_> gvo: it doesn't even have thumb generation
[06:07:11] <sammych_> that stuff is generally done serverside
[06:08:10] <gvo> That's my point.
[06:08:39] <sammych_> so, it's not different?
[06:08:47] <sammych_> it's the same, since it doesn't do any of it
[06:08:51] <gvo> RIght
[06:09:40] <gvo> Anes was suggesting there was something special about it, I wondered what he thought was so special?
[06:09:56] <sammych_> sorry, I should've read up
[06:10:13] <Anes> gvo : any idea?
[06:10:36] <sammych_> Anes: you'll need to build a server side page that handles form data with files attached
[06:10:47] <gvo> Anes ^^
[06:10:53] <Anes> yes i have akready one
[06:11:14] <sammych_> well, point uploadify at it in the correct format
[06:11:16] <Anes> i will show that now wait
[06:11:45] <sammych_> well, chances are it's the server side that has to read the format
[06:11:52] <Anes> http://pastie.org/8484904
[06:12:22] <Anes> the original file is uploaded , but not thumbnail
[06:12:46] <sammych_> are you even returning the image in the response?
[06:13:19] <sammych_> I'm not a PHP guy, but I can't see it
[06:14:15] <sammych_> someone at work wrote a handler in JSP for http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[06:14:26] <sammych_> and it's massive. Like 200 lines
[06:15:59] <gvo>  That php file doesn't upload anything
[06:16:52] <gvo> all it does is generate a thumbnail.
[06:17:05] <sammych_> yup

[08:39:24] <netAction> Hi! What is the equivalent to the touchstart event for releasing the finger from the screen?
[08:40:43] <kaeku> netAction: touchend
[08:41:25] <netAction> kaeku: This fires directly after touchstart when tapping. When scrolling it does not fire at all.
[08:43:12] <kaeku> netAction: well, for tapping there is .on('tap',
[08:43:43] <kaeku> netAction: you might wanna have peek at http://www.w3schools.com/jquerymobile/jquerymobile_events_touch.asp
[08:46:04] <netAction> kaeku: These are the events added by jQuery Mobile. I need an event when the user stops touching the screen.
[08:47:54] <kaeku> netAction: oh, nevermind then. haven't worked with touch on desktops yet
[08:48:21] <netAction> hmm

[09:20:29] <adrian_lc> hi, trying to handle a 302 response with ajax
[09:20:48] <adrian_lc> any way to, simply  follow the redirection?
[09:21:10] <shoky> adrian_lc: the browser usually follows it
[09:22:30] <adrian_lc> shoky, my firefox doesn't :/ https://dpaste.de/TFP7 see anything wrong?
[09:22:50] <adrian_lc> i'm just polling waiting for redirection
[09:23:48] <adrian_lc> from the server I'm returning an empty 200 application/json response and when the background task is ready, the 302
[09:23:58] <shoky> huh?
[09:24:19] <shoky> what response are you returning for the $.ajax request
[09:25:21] <adrian_lc> I have a background task running, the server checks if it's finished. if it's not it answers with empty json status code 200
[09:25:35] <adrian_lc> if it is finished, 302
[09:26:05] <shoky> what makes you say it's not following it
[09:26:38] <shoky> what does the firebug network tab say
[09:26:57] <adrian_lc> it load the page, but it doesn't display it
[09:27:00] <adrian_lc> loads*
[09:27:09] <shoky> why would it display anything?
[09:27:13] <adrian_lc> it only  gets the html
[09:27:24] <shoky> so it IS following the redirect..?
[09:27:49] <shoky> what html.. :\
[09:27:54] <adrian_lc> I guess... but that's useless to me, I want to move to the new page
[09:28:04] <shoky> ajax doesn't move to new pages
[09:28:11] <shoky> i donno what you mean
[09:28:29] <adrian_lc> damn :/ it's my first time using ajax
[09:28:53] <adrian_lc> so I have to return the url and change to it with window.location ?
[09:29:04] <shoky> that'd work
[09:29:05] <adrian_lc> can't be done automatically?
[09:30:34] <shoky> no. ajax is for getting/posting data from/to the server. not for changing the browser's location

[10:47:01] <MelkorNemesis> why is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/ui different from what I get from builder on web?
[10:47:28] <MelkorNemesis> e.g. jquery.ui.spinner.js seems to be old version in web builder
[11:07:15] <cronin> how do you solve this problem? http://jsfiddle.net/d4epg/. I know you can add the event assignment within $.each() to get it to work but is there another way?
[11:09:16] <shoky> cronin: with event delegation.  http://jsfiddle.net/d4epg/1/
[11:09:58] <cronin> shoky: oh cool, thanks!
[11:45:09] <Ortund> anyone familiar with jscroll? I don't see scrolling :/
[11:45:33] <Ortund> or limited paging for that matter
[11:51:49] <malibu> Hi there.  Is there something like formset, but that works with a set of DIFFERENT forms?
[11:51:59] <malibu> shoot wrong channel again
[12:29:55] <aljosa> how can i check what's been set w/ $.ajaxPrefilter()?
[12:56:56] <shoky> aljosa: i don't think you can
[13:13:23] <Blaster> Hey guys, is there a way to get the .text() of an element, but to exclude the text of it's children?  For example, I want to get the string Test from the anchor element.  <a href="#">Test<span>123</span></a>
[13:13:41] <Blaster> I tried $('a').not('span').text() but still got Test123
[13:14:05] <Blaster> I hope I can do it without using regex as in my actual use case the text is always changing.
[13:15:11] <Blaster> I think I might be able to do $(this).clone().children().remove().end().text()
[13:16:02] <shoky> Blaster:  $('a').contents().filter(function() { return this.nodeType === 3 }).text()
[13:17:12] <Blaster> this.nodeType ?
[13:17:18] <Blaster> I will have to look that up
[13:17:28] <Blaster> My other solution worked but I am curious how yours works too
[13:17:55] <shoky> nodeType 3 is text ndoes
[13:17:57] <shoky> text nodes
[13:18:12] <shoky> and .contents() gets all children including text nodes
[13:19:05] <shoky> another way:  var a = $('a');  a.contents().not( a.children() ).text()
[13:20:21] <shoky> your way is fine too
[13:30:09] <k1ng> can anyone tell me what are used to generate jsonp callback string? jQuery17203406319778878242_1384636712207
[13:31:55] <shoky> k1ng:  "jQuery" + ( core_version + Math.random() ).replace( /\D/g, "" ) +  "_" + ( ajax_nonce++ )
[13:32:08] <shoky> k1ng: where ajax_nonce is initialized to jQuery.now()
[13:34:30] <grafi> shoky you wizard
[13:34:31] <grafi> :P
[13:34:41] <k1ng> shoky, thank you :)
[13:36:41] <k1ng> wtf is  jQuery.expando
[13:36:46] <k1ng> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax/jsonp.js
[13:37:40] <shoky> it's this  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L194
[13:37:55] <k1ng> cool
[13:51:46] <pentaconnex2> Does anybody know how to achieve an in-string closest() ?
[13:52:35] <shoky> a what?
[13:52:48] <pentaconnex2> Something like .find("closest(div) a")
[13:53:18] <shoky> there's no selector for that
[13:53:23] <shoky> .closest('div').find('a')
[13:53:27] <pentaconnex2> I have a single string which needs to use .closest() and .find(). Any idea how i can achieve that?
[13:53:45] <pentaconnex2> doing Eval is kind of evil.
[13:53:52] <shoky> who said anything about eval
[13:54:21] <shoky> parse the string and call whatever you want
[13:54:49] <pentaconnex2> making a parser for that is kinda hard ^_^
[13:54:54] <shoky> a parser for what?
[13:54:59] <grafi> ._.
[13:55:02] <ezln> mdn down D:
[13:55:07] <shoky> what does your string look like..? what are you trying to do?
[13:56:21] <pentaconnex2> String would be  <a href="someAjaxCall" data-replace=".closest(ul).find(div.test)"
[13:56:30] <pentaconnex2> basically the data-replace.
[13:56:34] <pentaconnex2> contents ^_^
[13:57:44] <shoky> i'd re-think the whole approach ;p
[13:57:49] <ezln> ^
[13:59:00] <pentaconnex2> You do understand my goal right? I have a link that does some Ajax call which returns some data. The data is a Json which is parsed by the template which i define in data-template. However, it needs to know where to place the html rendered by the template.
[13:59:39] <pentaconnex2> So thats why i need some sort of way to traverse from the link that was clicked. Something along the lines of ".closest(ul).find(div.test)"
[13:59:53] <shoky> why does it have to be from the link?
[14:00:10] <shoky> why not.. by id? or from some common container..
[14:00:38] <pentaconnex2> I kinda dislike Ids ^_^
[14:01:02] <pentaconnex2> Especially when everything is dynamically added to the DOM.
[14:01:39] <grafi> eval is tons better :D
[14:01:44] <pentaconnex2> hahaha
[14:01:45] <pentaconnex2> its not
[14:02:04] <pentaconnex2> its just that i hoped there was a way to traverse in the opposite direction with a CSS / Jquery selector.
[14:02:13] <shoky> there isn't
[14:02:32] <pentaconnex2> ok then ^_^
[14:02:43] <shoky> but please don't eval :(
[14:02:56] <pentaconnex2> Naaa.. I won't.
[14:03:00] <shoky> yay
[14:03:28] <grafi> please use eval
[14:03:39] <pentaconnex2> I guess doing stuff by Ids is the best. However that would require me to add Ids on all the specific places i want to traverse from
[14:06:11] <pentaconnex2> Are you peeps JQuery Core devs?
[14:07:14] <shoky> grafi and I are not
[14:07:24] <grafi> speak for yourself
[14:07:25] <grafi> xD
[14:07:47] <shoky> you speak for me too
[14:07:58] <grafi> because i can
[14:08:01] <pentaconnex2> When is Jquery gonna be rewritten in Typescript ?
[14:08:01] <pentaconnex2> :P
[14:08:02] <grafi> mwaahahaha
[14:08:25] <grafi> when pigs learn to fly
[14:08:26] <grafi> ...
[14:08:43] <shoky> ew typescript
[14:08:49] <pentaconnex2> you dont like it ?
[14:08:50] <grafi> typecrap
[14:08:56] <shoky> way to take all the fun out of js
[14:09:00] <pentaconnex2> HAAHAHAH
[14:09:02] <pentaconnex2> FUN
[14:09:02] <grafi> :>
[14:09:05] <pentaconnex2> Define FUN
[14:09:07] <pentaconnex2> :P
[14:09:16] <grafi> that loooks more like a lisp
[14:09:19] <ezln> $.Deferred are fun, for example
[14:09:31] <shoky> would be awesome if it looked more like a lisp
[14:09:41] <shoky> got clojurescript for that tho
[14:09:56] <pentaconnex2> After i made all my widgets Jquery Plugins which took me days.
[14:10:09] <pentaconnex2> I converted all my Jquery Widgets to the Jquery UI Widget Factory which took me days.
[14:10:36] <pentaconnex2> Then I realised Typescript Classes are far more cleaner and i recoded my widgets to TS widgets, which took me days.
[14:10:42] <pentaconnex2> Being a developer is fun ^_^.
[14:10:50] <shoky> k
[14:11:02] <grafi> making up your mind before you waste days is more fun ^^
[14:11:56] <BillCriswell> How about taking 3 hours to name a variable?
[14:12:05] <grafi> thats the way i do it
[14:12:09] <shoky> 3 hours well spent
[14:12:11] <grafi> naming things is cruel
[14:12:11] <grafi> :p
[14:13:04] <pentaconnex2> hmm.. I normally first take 3 hours to determine the namespace of the actual file.
[14:13:38] <grafi> namespaces are for amateurs :p
[14:18:15] <BillCriswell> I can't even decide how to structure my folders half the time.
[14:19:34] <grafi> thats why
[14:19:40] <grafi> you put everything
[14:19:46] <grafi> on your desktop
[14:19:47] <grafi> :P
[14:20:19] <pentaconnex2> I have 3 folders on my desktop
[14:20:26] <grafi> you monster
[14:20:32] <pentaconnex2> Called DesktopOld1, DesktopOld2 and DesktopOld3
[14:20:37] <grafi> lol
[14:20:38] <grafi> ^^
[14:20:42] <pentaconnex2> The rest are files of 2 screen resolutions full
[14:20:51] <grafi> i went through that phase
[14:20:52] <grafi> ^^
[14:20:58] <pentaconnex2> how u fixed it?
[14:21:06] <grafi> deleted everything
[14:21:07] <pentaconnex2> CTRL + A + CTRL + SHIFT + DELETE
[14:21:07] <grafi> :P
[14:21:08] <pentaconnex2> ?
[14:21:29] <grafi> nothing on my desktop anymore
[14:21:36] <grafi> :>
[14:21:48] <pentaconnex2> Its in your Windows My Documents folder now :P?
[14:22:17] <grafi> nah
[14:22:43] <grafi> the windows folders are mostly empty too ^^
[15:55:58] <mr_dobalina> Just started learning jQuery. Can anyone tell me why some functions follow camelCase and others don't? Such as appendTo and mouseenter.
[15:56:12] <mr_dobalina> It's hard to remember which one's have the second word capitalized and which don't
[15:57:03] <shoky> mr_dobalina: most follow camelCase. mouseenter doesn't because it is a shortcut for adding an event handler for the "mouseenter" event
[15:57:25] <shoky> so the event shortcuts don't follow camelCase
[17:35:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> hi all :)
[17:53:35] <Lorgon> Who created jquery?
[17:55:01] <shoky> some guy
[17:58:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[17:58:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> what an answer
[17:58:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> Lorgon: http://ejohn.org/about/
[18:04:27] <BillCriswell> I'd have that shit at the top of my resume.
[18:08:38] <aldug> Is there any way to get the value of an input field from a form submission inside of the form submit() event handler using $(this)?
[18:09:03] <aldug> I know I can do $(this).serialize() inside of the submit event handler, but I just want to get one input value
[18:17:13] <shoky> aldug: .val() gets an input's value. also i think you can call .serialize() on inputs too
[18:17:21] <Betal> any idea how can I go from the last <a> to the last <p>? my $(this) is in the last <a>: http://pastebin.com/3ienHwcd
[18:18:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> BillCriswell: what?
[18:18:19] <shoky> Betal: many ways.. $(this).prev().children('p').last()  is one
[18:34:06] <aphorism> Hello! I have a div whose width should change dynamically from the value obtained from within a span. I identified that span with its id, and the tag shows up, but when I use .text(), it says "Object #<HTMLSpanElement> has no method 'text".
[18:34:19] <aphorism> I'm pretty sure I'm using the jQuery object and not the dom
[18:34:32] <aphorism> I use jinja2 rendering engine if that helps
[18:37:54] <jrajav> aphorism: Double-check that
[18:38:08] <jrajav> aphorism: From that error it would seem that you are in fact using the raw DOM element
[18:38:42] <jrajav> You could check whether that's the problem by wrapping it in $( ) before doing the .text()
[18:39:22] <aphorism> True. Several threads online suggested that so I verified it. Could you please check this.. http://jsfiddle.net/suCLB/
[18:41:01] <shoky> that works fine..?
[18:43:25] <jrajav> aphorism: I think the problem is actually with your $('innerbar')
[18:43:35] <jrajav> aphorism: That should probably be $('.innerbar')
[18:44:04] <aphorism> UGH...that's true!
[18:44:05] <shoky> oo i missed that. *whips self*
[18:45:00] <aphorism> thanks jrajav!
[18:45:04] <jrajav> np
[18:51:18] <mintmoney> so im working with a theme that says :  event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead.
[18:51:28] <mintmoney> haven't touched the code...
[18:52:25] <mintmoney> thats from chrome... firefox says: Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead
[18:52:46] <mintmoney> from the jquery-1.10.2.min
[18:54:15] <mintmoney> do i need 2 separate functions for me to stop the event or what?
[18:55:28] <shoky> mintmoney: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14282   it's fixed in the next version
[18:55:36] <shoky> (which is not out yet)
[18:55:44] <mintmoney> hrmm
[18:55:46] <shoky> well the beta is
[18:56:01] <mintmoney> should i use the beta?
[18:56:23] <shoky> what kinda question is that?
[18:56:28] <shoky> that's up to you
[18:56:31] <mintmoney> lol
[18:56:37] <mintmoney> or should i use an older version?
[18:56:43] <mintmoney> or would that not matter
[18:56:50] <shoky> nothing's broken.. you don't have to do anything
[18:57:36] <mintmoney> well in chrome i was using event.preventDefault(); to stop a form submit from redirection, didnt stop the event in firefox
[18:57:58] <shoky> this has nothing to do with your code
[18:59:07] <shoky> mintmoney: sounds like maybe you forgot to put the "event" as an argument to your submit handler
[19:01:34] <mintmoney> shoky: works in chrome though?
[19:01:47] <shoky> mintmoney: i don't know what you're doing
[19:01:59] <shoky> `demo
[19:01:59] <b-ot> shoky: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:03:08] <mintmoney> shoky: http://pastie.org/8486147
[19:03:34] <mintmoney> or http://54.213.174.137:8080/vw/
[19:03:55] <shoky> you'd have to look at the jquery validation plugin documentation
[19:04:12] <shoky> on how to properly prevent submits when using it
[19:04:34] <mintmoney> k
[19:04:52] <mintmoney> im going to switch to a newer version of the theme anyway
[19:05:32] <lejocelyn> hi, I thought I could use the complete option of $.ajax() to put data into an array, but it seems that not a working solution : http://pastebin.fr/31671
[19:05:36] <lejocelyn> any advice ?
[19:05:38] <shoky> but anyway if you call $('form').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault() })  that should prevent it for sure~
[19:06:16] <lejocelyn> (can't use jsfiddle or other heavy website, my connexion is too slow)
[19:07:12] <shoky> lejocelyn: ajax is asynchronous, you can't use the responses until there's actually a response. which happens much later than your 2nd for loop
[19:07:24] <shoky> also, don't use for..in to loop on arrays.
[19:07:33] <lejocelyn> that's why I complete
[19:07:34] <shoky> for..in is for looping object keys
[19:07:40] <lejocelyn> isn't it the purpose of complete ?
[19:07:43] <shoky> lejocelyn: no
[19:08:33] <lejocelyn> then, what to do ?
[19:10:27] <mintmoney> shoky: its not my code that's throwing the error
[19:10:42] <mintmoney> its happening in the latest version of the theme as well
[19:10:50] <shoky> mintmoney: that's what i said
[19:10:54] <mintmoney> o
[19:10:55] <mintmoney> lol
[19:11:04] <mintmoney> i was just validating u :)
[19:11:18] <mintmoney> so wait, why would i use 1.8 or something?
[19:11:27] <mintmoney> wouldnt**
[19:11:37] <shoky> huh?
[19:11:48] <lejocelyn> shoky: I guess when() then() should do ?
[19:12:33] <mintmoney> would using jquery 1.8.x instead of 1.10.x resolve the issue? or do they throw the error too?
[19:13:16] <Betal> shoky: thanks, it works, only don't works when using jquery mobile because it change all the page
[19:13:18] <shoky> lejocelyn:  yes, maybe something like this: http://pastebin.com/Mp9tgUSF
[19:14:00] <shoky> mintmoney: i think it'll happen on every version
[19:14:19] <shoky> mintmoney: it's started happening because chrome has updated, not because something changed in jquery
[19:15:06] <mintmoney> gotcha
[19:15:27] <mintmoney> well firefox throws a different error
[19:15:35] <mintmoney> so its not just chrome
[19:18:33] <shoky> what error does firefox throw?
[19:33:08] <Tingle> would $('a[data-contentTarget]'); select every <a> that has a data-contentTarget attribute on it? Or do I need to add a ="" with it?
[19:34:03] <pixelpimp> nope, that should work
[19:34:09] <Tingle> ok cool, thanks
[19:37:43] <lejocelyn> is there a way to get an iterator of an object's values ?
[19:38:17] <lejocelyn> like Object.keys(obj)  but not over the keys but the values : Object.values(ob) would be nice but seems not to exist
[19:43:19] <lejocelyn> I guess there isn't
[19:45:29] <lejocelyn> may be : Object.getOwnPropertyNames
[19:45:31] <lejocelyn> no ?
[19:48:54] <Tingle> how do I sub select elements? say I have $('#unique'), how would I select all <a> inside that?
[19:49:10] <shoky> Tingle: .find
[19:49:14] <pixelpimp> !api find
[19:49:14] <b-ot> pixelpimp: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[19:49:15] <Tingle> ah ok cool
[19:51:25] <andrewSC> hi all
[19:52:51] <andrewSC> I was curious, so you know how twitter has a "streaming" api connection where it can push tweets out to clients that are listening? Is there a way to do a "push" type model with jQuery? Basically I've already setup the server-side code to maintain the connection to the twitter stream, I'm just wondering if I can do the same with something in jQuery
[19:53:33] <andrewSC> so the frontend JS would fire an event when I pushed down an update from my server side code
[19:57:19] <andrewSC> I could just send an ajax request every second
[19:57:28] <andrewSC> fire*
[19:57:32] <andrewSC> at my server
[20:27:33] <lejocelyn> is there a way to have the jquery online doc offline ?
[20:27:59] <rue> lejocelyn: $ wget -m
[20:31:47] <lejocelyn> :)
[20:31:50] <lejocelyn> true
[21:08:42] <lejocelyn> I've got this bit of code someone helped me to write : http://pastebin.fr/31673 but it doesn't work : http://pastebin.fr/31674
[21:08:56] <lejocelyn> the line 20 isn't executed accroding to firebug
[21:09:02] <lejocelyn> any advise ?
[21:09:33] <lejocelyn> oups
[21:09:38] <lejocelyn> read the pastebin http://pastebin.fr/31674
[21:09:40] <lejocelyn> :)
[21:11:20] <andrewSC> lejocelyn: what's the error say?
[21:11:43] <lejocelyn> andrewSC: no errors in Firebug
[21:11:48] <lejocelyn> no error messages
[21:12:08] <lejocelyn> just stop executing
[21:14:49] <lejocelyn> andrewSC: I think the problem comes from arguments
[21:15:00] <lejocelyn> I'm not sure what to put there
[21:15:31] <lejocelyn> how can I get the result of the requests in datas ?
[21:20:04] <lejocelyn> shoky: your code doesn't work :)

[21:48:08] <sasmit87> Rohan_Bhangui: might be probleam in query
[21:48:24] <lejocelyn> the requests object seems ok
[21:48:26] <shoky> lejocelyn: but you say if you put a console.log inside the done callbaci, you don't see the log? so it's not being called
[21:48:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: i figured since that is the only part where code can change
[21:48:47] <David_Park_SI_D1> I'm trying to figure out why the <p> content gets cut off when i hit the "more information" toggle. http://test.hpcreatives.net/team.html
[21:49:04] <lejocelyn> shoky: exactly
[21:49:05] <sasmit87> I given true and false statically then its working
[21:49:16] <lejocelyn> shoky: it stop working after the line 20
[21:49:40] <lejocelyn> shoky: at the line 20
[21:49:58] <shoky> lejocelyn: what makes you say it arrives at line 20?
[21:50:38] <lejocelyn> nothing, firebug stops executing the script
[21:50:58] <lejocelyn> ah, the breakpoints
[21:51:09] <sasmit87> Rohan_Bhangui: any idea how to change the default error message
[21:51:09] <lejocelyn> or I'm not sure how to call those in English
[21:51:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: isnt it just or die(mysql_error());
[21:51:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> at the end of a mysql_query()
[21:52:07] <sasmit87> okay
[21:53:51] <lejocelyn> shoky: Firebug bugs sorry
[21:54:09] <lejocelyn> sometimes, breakpoints make the ajax call not working
[21:54:13] <lejocelyn> actually, quite often
[21:55:01] <lejocelyn> shoky: but then, it doesn't display the datas but just numbers
[21:57:25] <shoky> lejocelyn: hm?
[21:57:44] <shoky> remove the async:false
[21:57:51] <shoky> you should never use that
[21:58:31] <lejocelyn> shoky: where do you see a async:false ?
[21:58:57] <shoky> lejocelyn: oops confused your code with sasmit87's
[21:59:09] <lejocelyn> http://pastebin.fr/31674
[22:00:04] <shoky> ok, and?
[22:00:58] <lejocelyn> it doesn't work actually. I get the forms but I can't display them
[22:01:41] <lejocelyn> how to get the responseText ?
[22:02:02] <shoky> they way i showed should be getting it from the arguments
[22:02:12] <lejocelyn> no
[22:02:15] <lejocelyn> it's not
[22:02:30] <shoky> i said should
[22:02:39] <lejocelyn> :D
[22:02:43] <lejocelyn> sorry
[22:05:01] <shoky> oh sorry, each argument is an array of [ data, statusText, jqXHR ]
[22:06:14] <shoky> so use .after(data[0]) instead of .after(data)
[22:07:27] <lejocelyn> thanks
[22:07:38] <lejocelyn> I'll need to read more to understand that bit
[22:11:00] <shoky> not working for me for some reason
[22:11:45] <shoky> oh nevermind
[22:12:06] <lejocelyn> never for me actually
[22:12:08] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/56dV9/
[22:13:38] <lejocelyn> jsfiddle is too heavy for my slow connection...
[22:13:58] * lejocelyn is lost in the middle of the pacific
[22:14:09] * lejocelyn doing linguistic researches
[22:15:26] <lejocelyn> ah no, it works actually
[22:15:59] <lejocelyn> that's it
[22:16:04] <lejocelyn> thanks a lot
[22:17:53] <shoky> np
[22:25:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: any luck?
[22:25:32] <sasmit87> its working now
[22:25:34] <sasmit87> thankx
[22:25:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> what was wrong?
[23:29:19] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/4xb9B/6/ <-- what is best way to have dubble replace on same line?
[23:37:17] <Cork> Whiskey: dubble?
[23:38:28] <Whiskey> Cork, yeh i would like to have something like this $(this).html($(this).html().replace(/(\*)/gi, "<span class=\"green\">$1</span>").replace); <--- another replace and then make sure thats is only can fit to current replace you get me?
[23:39:03] <Whiskey> whit other words, if the firist replace not was applayed the second one should not apply ether and vice versa
[23:39:52] <Cork> Whiskey: can't really do that
[23:40:00] <Whiskey> you got what i mean?
[23:40:04] <Cork> Whiskey: but you can use a function for replace
[23:40:10] <Cork> and that might help you
[23:42:26] <Whiskey> yeh its complicated :/
[23:42:42] <Whiskey> Must be some way to check this, its like 100 lines so would be nice to have a function insted of alot of if questions
[23:44:22] <Cork> Whiskey: like i said use the callback function
[23:47:00] <Whiskey> you mean jQuery callback()
[23:48:05] <Cork> ?mdn replace
