[00:05:22] <antnash> Hey guys. Can anyone suggest any web design books that will help me create a website more efficiently? I can code fine, but I mean more on taking a site from conception to a finished product
[00:07:27] <jrockjiggz2> tw2113: I managed to use unwrap()
[00:07:40] <tw2113> cool
[00:08:33] <r500> firedfox: thanks :) had got the solution... just saw the chat.anyways thanks again for replying
[00:12:43] <jrockjiggz2> man. i can't figure out why white-space is causing space between my elements..
[00:13:17] <jrockjiggz2> I need whitespace, but its causing 'extra' space on another page..
[00:15:34] <r500> what about blackspaces?
[00:15:52] <jrockjiggz2> maybe they will cancel eachother out
[00:16:35] <jrockjiggz2> I put whitespace between elements so they will wrap.. but then on another page the whitespace is making an additional ' ' between elements...
[00:17:07] <jrockjiggz> and i can't figure it out.. i've had this problem for years
[00:22:25] <diverdude> is it possible to add an icon to to a webpage using jquery, when i just want a subpart of the image - like can be done with css using eg. background-position:0px -72px. (all icons are in one big sheet)
[00:22:56] <JohnCarter> diverdude,  why not use .css() and do it :p
[00:23:02] <JohnCarter> with background-position
[00:24:18] <diverdude> JohnCarter: does jquery know that if the big icon-sheet has been downloaded once, additional downloads are not necessary?
[00:24:47] <diverdude> JohnCarter: like if i want to add 20 icons...all originating from same image-sheet....will jquery then download the sheet 20 times?
[00:24:54] <JohnCarter> diverdude, I know what you mean
[00:24:57] <JohnCarter> but I have no idea
[00:24:58] <JohnCarter>  lol
[00:25:05] <diverdude> hmm
[00:26:26] <diverdude> does javascript know that if a big icon-image-sheet has been downloaded once, additional downloads are not necessary? like if i want to add 20 different icons to my page...all originating from same icon-image-sheet....will javascript then download the sheet 20 times or be clever enough to reuse the already downloaded image-sheet?
[00:27:16] <tw2113> the image sprite would be in the browser cache
[00:28:23] <tw2113> not completely sure why you need jquery/js to move the sprite around
[00:34:56] <diverdude> tw2113: because im adding elements dynamically
[00:35:01] <diverdude> tw2113: or icons
[00:35:37] <tw2113> ah
[00:36:24] <tw2113> i can't help but think it'd be easier to set up class names ahead of time with the icons in place and dimensions, and then use jQuery to toggle classes
[00:36:39] <diverdude> tw2113: hmm yeah ok
[00:37:03] <tw2113> makes sense to me at least
[00:38:43] <diverdude> tw2113: and browser cache automatically handles the image?
[00:39:08] <tw2113> much of the reason why sprites became popular
[00:39:11] <tw2113> 1 http request
[00:42:04] <diverdude> tw2113: ahhhh this is already done :D http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html i just need to do <i class="icon-search"></i>
[00:42:30] * tw2113 hasn't done much at all with bootstrap anything
[00:44:08] <diverdude> tw2113: its awesome
[00:44:20] <tw2113> so i've heard
[00:44:23] <tw2113> just never had need

[01:33:27] <scathen^C> fuckin api.jquery is down....is there another place to find it
[01:50:34] <CasW> Hey guys, why won't my image appear (on http://technotaal.nl/filmkunde)? It looks like it appears for a moment and then disappears again... Even odder; it does work on my local server...
[02:03:07] <opalepatrick> is api.jquery.com down?
[02:03:51] <CasW> Looks down from here.
[02:04:34] <eip56> yea it sdown
[02:05:21] <opalepatrick> cheers guys
[02:10:01] <CasW> Can anyone tell me why the image doesn't appear on http://technotaal.nl/filmkunde/? (Just type tt0253474 in the search field and press enter) There should be an image on the right of the text.
[02:12:54] <eip56> did yo set a hight and widht?
[02:13:06] <eip56> looks to be a css issue
[02:14:12] <CasW> I have set a width, not a height, though.
[02:15:10] <CasW> If I do set a height, nothing changes.
[02:15:49] <opalepatrick> CasW, running it using firebug it shows a 403 permission problem for the image
[02:16:59] <opalepatrick> "NetworkError: 403 Forbidden - http://ia.media-imdb.com/images.... etc
[02:17:59] <CasW> Ah, clever, checking the codes! ;) Okay, now how to fix it...
[02:18:26] <CasW> If I just browse to the link, I c√°n see it...
[02:19:11] <opalepatrick> :-) try using the firebug extension in firefox or other browsers, dead handy
[02:19:29] <CasW> I am using Firebug, I just don't really know how to handle it ;)
[02:19:51] <CasW> (I mostly use it for changing CSS and stuff, never for status codes)
[02:21:23] <CasW> Why does it work on localhost, then?
[02:28:07] <opalepatrick> CasW, I am a firebug novice tbh, but I just check the javascript tab and make sure it is enabled then go to the console tab and reload
[02:28:20] <opalepatrick> the uri
[02:31:33] <CasW> But why d√≥es it work on my localhost and not on my normal site? Hm, I can try one more thing...
[02:32:36] <CasW> Didn't work. :(
[02:33:18] <CasW> If i use an iframe...
[02:33:23] <CasW> *I
[02:34:34] <CasW> Referral denied. Bastard IMDb. :P
[02:35:45] <eip56> casw how are you loading jQuery via the CDN or locally from the server
[02:36:24] <CasW> I'm loading it from Google's servers, that's better with caching and stuff.
[02:37:28] <eip56> ok well lets start simple let smake sure its loading
[02:37:43] <eip56> code coming
[02:38:26] <CasW> That's not the problem, jQuery's working like a charm, IMDb just doesn't want me to use their pictures (403)
[02:38:50] <eip56> link plz
[02:39:04] <CasW> http://technotaal.nl/filmkunde/
[02:42:00] <eip56> cant read that language sorry
[02:42:31] <eip56> is there something wrong with the file permissions on the server
[02:42:43] <eip56> ie its not set to readable writable
[02:43:09] <CasW> The code's English ;) But never mind, that site was just some fiddling about, and I'll just use images on my own server in the final product.
[02:43:53] <CasW> I'm getting that image from IMDb, but they don't want me to; they block requests from other sites or something like that, I don't know exactly how, but that's probably the problem.
[02:45:44] <diverdude> did anybody manage to use an external datasource for the twitter bootstrap typeahead component?
[02:46:55] <eip56> CasW is the image not located on your server?>
[02:47:27] <CasW> No, like I said, I'm getting that image from IMDb, and they don't want me to, so there's nothing I can really do.

[04:41:50] <Billy_> Cork: are you around?
[05:09:43] <Billy_> $("#objectID").load("test.php", { 'choices[]': ["Jon", "Susan"] } );
[05:09:57] <Billy_> how to read this array choices
[05:09:59] <Billy_> ??
[05:10:12] <Billy_>  $("#objectID").load("test.php", { 'choices[]': ["Jon", "Susan"] } ); how to read this array choices on the pages
[05:12:45] <Billy_> ??
[05:16:00] <phoenixson> just a simple question really
[05:16:01] <Billy_> Cork: are you there?
[05:16:19] <Billy_> phoenixson: how to read that?
[05:16:26] <Billy_>  $("#objectID").load("test.php", { 'choices[]': ["Jon", "Susan"] } ); how to read this array choices on the pages
[05:16:34] <phoenixson> where in an html page would you put <script> $(window).load() </script>
[05:16:35] <phoenixson> ?
[05:17:14] <phoenixson> in order for it to execute properly
[05:17:31] <Billy_> yes i out
[05:17:39] <Billy_> yes i put
[05:17:53] <Billy_> how can i access the choice  array?
[05:18:01] <Billy_> phoenixson: ?
[05:18:06] <NodeX> 42
[05:18:23] <phoenixson> <Billy_: I am trying to implement the Nivo slider
[05:18:32] <Billy_> ok
[05:18:37] <phoenixson> I put that code in the body and its not running
[05:18:39] <NodeX> in test.php it's $_POST['choices']
[05:19:00] <phoenixson> Billy_: in the head I have the needed js files loading straight from online
[05:19:11] <phoenixson> so I guess its just not executing for some reason
[05:19:24] <Billy_> NodeX : the page name is test.html
[05:19:43] <NodeX> so why do you have test.php in the load() ?
[05:19:47] <Billy_> then how will i access this through jquery?
[05:19:51] <Billy_> any idea/
[05:19:59] <NodeX> access what ?
[05:20:23] <NodeX> I don't understand what you're trying to access
[05:20:45] <Billy_> $("#objectID").load("test.php", { 'choices[]': ["Jon", "Susan"] } ); how to read this array choices on the pages
[05:20:55] <Billy_> i want to access the Choices array
[05:21:02] <NodeX> repeating the question doesn't make it make more sense
[05:21:14] <NodeX> access it where?
[05:21:19] <Billy_> in html page
[05:21:27] <NodeX> what html page?
[05:21:28] <Billy_> name test.html
[05:21:36] <NodeX> with what language ?
[05:21:43] <Billy_> jquery
[05:21:55] <NodeX> why, you already have it
[05:22:08] <NodeX> you must already have the array to add it to the load function
[05:23:34] <Billy_> Actually i pass the url to jquery dialog with some data now i want to fill that data in the input box
[05:23:56] <NodeX> you're working back to front
[05:24:57] <NodeX> if you're trying to read them on a page loaded via ajax you will need to parse the query string uri
[05:31:18] <matt1982> hmm does anyone know if there is a way to daisy chain the UI dialog popups. Just wondering if there was a plugin already. For example after I have closed one it opens another. Kind of like flash cards.
[05:31:46] <matt1982> I guess I could just do an on close it checks to see if there are any more dialogs to show perhaps.
[05:52:06] <TastefullyBlue> Hello! I'm needing some help with making a div fade out, and fade in continously. I'd like the div to take a second to fade out, and fade in within a second. Cany anyone help me?
[05:58:11] <phoenixson> could someone help me out with the Nivo JQuery slider?
[05:58:24] <phoenixson> I have put the code in all the right places but it wont start up
[06:00:10] <TastefullyBlue> phoenixson, are you getting any kind of error, or is it just not sliding?
[06:00:24] <phoenixson> just doesnt show up at all
[06:01:30] <phoenixson> and I think it has something to do with the (window).load() code in there
[06:01:55] <TastefullyBlue> Do you mind sharing the URL you have it on?
[06:02:45] <phoenixson> I am running it all local atm
[06:03:07] <phoenixson> I have found a deep tutorial so I will check that out and then maybe I can ask some more well informed questions
[06:09:46] <nowotny> what's up with the jQuery servers... most of subdomains (eg. api.jquery.com) doesn't work...

[06:56:11] <Zogot> back
[06:59:27] <phoenixson> TastefullyBlue: I have gotten Nivo Slider to work but I have no control over it

[07:44:22] <wpsmith> do u use a timer?
[07:45:44] <psyolus> Is the bug with Firefix and .getAllResponseHeaders() a Firefox or jQuery issue?

[08:05:52] <biberao2> hi
[08:13:32] <rabbi1> seems like all are in week end .... ?
[08:13:33] <rabbi1> :)
[08:15:32] <luchenbill> is there a way to count the number of a particular elements on a page? ex: a xml page who's element product will always have a dynamic amount of potential elements?
[08:18:05] <luchenbill> will it have to be some type of .each or is there a built in method that will count the number of like elements?
[08:18:14] <systemfault> .length ? :/
[08:19:20] <luchenbill> sorry i'll post an example
[08:20:55] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/HGFeG/ so clearly there are 3 product elements, but how can I find out the number of product elements if it changes each day? one day there may be 3 one day there may be 30
[08:22:00] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/HGFeG/1/
[08:23:28] <luchenbill> wow haha fail LOL!
[08:23:30] <luchenbill> :P
[08:23:38] <luchenbill> *face desk*
[08:24:22] <elegos> hello! I'm using the method .submit() in order to send a POST form, but it doesn't seem to upload the files (in fact the PHP's $_FILES variable is void). What's wrong? I've got 3 INPUTs with type="file".
[08:25:03] <elegos> in $_REQUEST I see them as normal text...
[08:25:48] <systemfault> elegos: Do you have the enctype attribute on the form element?
[08:26:01] <elegos> no I don't
[08:26:06] <systemfault> :)
[08:26:07] <elegos> uhm
[08:26:17] <elegos> something in my mind is saying "add it" xD
[08:26:23] <elegos> multipart/form-data right?
[08:26:25] <systemfault> enctype="multipart/form-data"
[08:26:27] <systemfault> Yeah
[08:26:33] <systemfault> To the form element
[08:28:49] <luchenbill> what does that do?
[08:29:51] <systemfault> What?
[08:30:22] <systemfault> The enctype?
[08:30:57] <danheberden> i smell a google search coming
[08:31:11] <biberao2> could anyone check a site and tell me if thats a normal popup
[08:31:11] <biberao2> ?
[08:31:15] <systemfault> For files, that encoding type will add a text marker at the beginning and end of the file..
[08:31:31] <luchenbill> oh cool :)
[08:31:59] <systemfault> luchenbill: If not, the binary file might have a & in it and mess up the form string
[08:31:59] <luchenbill> so with the .length is there a way I can use $i = $xml->product.length?
[08:32:32] <systemfault> luchenbill: $(xmlDoc).find('product').length if you load it from AJAX
[08:32:54] <luchenbill> i'm using simplexml_load_file()
[08:33:03] <luchenbill> probably should use ajax though
[08:33:12] <luchenbill> *is new if you can't tell*
[08:33:18] <luchenbill> :|
[08:35:42] <luchenbill> god i'm an idiot sorry that's a php question
[08:35:56] <systemfault> ;/
[08:40:01] <luchenbill> so do you believe it's better to use jquery/ajax php than just pure php for handling dynamic xml pages?
[08:48:31] <rabbi1> how can i set an event to a tabbed onclick ?
[08:48:55] <rabbi1> $("#fpassword").click(function() { alert ("Tab Clicked"); });  is this correct ?
[08:49:59] <gianbalex> yes rabbi1
[08:50:31] <rabbi1> gianbalex: should that be inside html or external file, alert isn't popping up :(
[08:50:46] <luchenbill> is it better to use .click(function(){}) or .on('click', function(){}) ?
[08:50:52] <systemfault> rabbi1: Where is that snippet of code?
[08:51:01] <systemfault> rabbi1: Where is it located in the markup?
[08:51:14] <systemfault> luchenbill: There's no better but I personally use always .on
[08:51:24] <systemfault> You know‚Ä¶ consistency
[08:51:34] <luchenbill> yeah I try to as well, I just didn't know if there was a difference
[08:51:35] <gianbalex> make sure you have id="fpassword" element in your html page and not id="#fpassword"
[08:51:38] <luchenbill> as far as performance
[08:52:09] <gianbalex> so, paste your code for more hels
[08:52:11] <gianbalex> helps
[08:52:28] <systemfault> luchenbill: Nah, .click is just or shortcut
[08:52:34] <systemfault> s/or/a
[08:53:45] <luchenbill> ahh cool thx
[08:55:08] <rabbi1> i am trying to put my code in jsfiddle, could you please provide me the link for Jquery UI  css link ?
[08:55:56] <systemfault> Just tick the jqueryui checkbox?
[08:56:44] <rabbi1> is this correct ? ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/themes/ui-lightness/jquery-ui.css
[08:57:16] <systemfault> rabbi1: You don't want to understand?
[08:57:45] <rabbi1> systemfault: i have already checked, i am not getting the tab
[08:57:49] <systemfault> On the left panel, select jquery 1.7.2 then tick the checkbox just under it writte "jquery UI 1.8.8"
[08:58:02] <systemfault> *1.8.18
[08:58:54] <rabbi1> systemfault: yeah, onLoad , jQuery 1.7.2 and checked jQuery UI 1.8.18

[08:59:37] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/NzuEt/
[08:59:48] <batdorf> I have a function that runs once when the page loads, and again when a button is pressed. When I load the browser, console.log($('.tab1 a') ); returns an empty object. But when I click on a button, it returns the desired result. The rest of the function runs normally.
[08:59:49] <rabbi1> I am still unable to get the tab there
[09:02:04] <systemfault> batdorf: Is that code wrapped in a ready event? $(document).ready(function() { yourcodehere });
[09:02:12] <rabbi1> o gosh, i wanted something else doing something else in jsfiddle :(
[09:02:52] <batdorf> yes, it is
[09:03:28] <systemfault> batdorf: Seems that the node doesn't exists when your code is run
[09:03:51] <batdorf> anything you suggest I try?
[09:03:51] <rabbi1> gianbalex: http://jsfiddle.net/NzuEt/1/ i have no idea, why tab is not displayed there :(
[09:04:44] <systemfault> rabbi1: Seems to work but for some reason the CSS is not loaded :$
[09:05:01] <systemfault> rabbi1: So that's why you don't see the result
[09:05:23] <rabbi1> systemfault: that's ok, but the click function for "Forgot Password" is my problem :(
[09:05:48] <systemfault> rabbi1: The tab or the link?
[09:05:59] <systemfault> Forgot Password OR Forgot Password!
[09:06:05] <rabbi1> systemfault: if css is loaded then tab, else its a link
[09:06:10] <gianbalex> <li><a href="#passtab">Forgot Password</a></li>
[09:06:17] <gianbalex> a id="passtab"
[09:06:24] <gianbalex> i forgot it
[09:06:27] <gianbalex> you*
[09:07:00] <rabbi1> systemfault: the other Forgot Password ! is in the logon tab, so unable to find the difference, any way its forgot password *first link
[09:07:07] <gianbalex> or use $("a[href="#passtab"]).click(function(){ alert("clicked!") })
[09:08:05] <gianbalex> but to increase performance, add attribute id to your <a> tag
[09:08:08] <rabbi1> gianbalex: brb will try, thx
[09:08:14] <gianbalex> ;)
[09:08:18] <rabbi1> gianbalex: u mean <span> ?
[09:08:37] <systemfault> lol performance.
[09:08:58] <gianbalex> no
[09:09:34] <gianbalex> ( sorry for my english ) LOL
[09:10:27] <rabbi1> gianbalex: has no effect http://jsfiddle.net/NzuEt/2/
[09:10:39] <batdorf> systemfault: do you have any suggestions about what I might try?
[09:11:28] <gianbalex> ooh sorry rabbi1
[09:11:32] <gianbalex> passtab is a div?
[09:11:34] <systemfault> batdorf: If your nodes already exist and the code is called on the "ready" event, no :(
[09:11:39] <rabbi1> gianbalex: yeap
[09:11:47] <gianbalex> div dont give events.
[09:12:00] <gianbalex> only children elements
[09:12:19] <rabbi1> gianbalex: but i am working to get a click event for <a> tag
[09:12:22] <gianbalex> you can't use clik on it
[09:12:36] <batdorf> thanks, i'll try a few more things and report back if i solve it :)
[09:12:41] <gianbalex> to a event you can
[09:13:56] <gianbalex> so, try $("#passtab *").click() if you want to capture all childrens events of #passtab
[09:13:58] <rabbi1> gianbalex: ok, infact i am using a validate.js to validate fields on the logtab div and then if its true it has to allow users to access passtab else return to logtab automatically. so here i am trying to check for that on a onclick event of that second tab .... how can i do it ?
[09:16:55] <rabbi1> gianbalex: any idea / suggestion i can use "tabselect" of tabs ?
[09:18:20] <Sarahs> hey juys, i have a small issue. im using jquery-galleryview and its working perfectly but on ie9 it wont show any image. here is the error im getting and the affected code. i would appreciate any help.http://pastebin.com/mgraVTYc
[09:18:51] <kone> hello!! question. I have a index.html that when you click in a button, you .load other hmtl. Well i want to access a id of  the other html from the index.html
[09:19:06] <gianbalex> do you want display logon first and Recover Password on click of <a> tabs?
[09:19:17] <kone> but of course, at the beginning, it doesn't work
[09:19:37] <kone> it seems that i need just before the other html loads, research for elements with the id
[09:20:12] <gianbalex> kone, load ajax html?
[09:20:21] <kone> example: http://www.carlosbermudezdecastro.com/portfolio2/ in this example, as you can see in the code i load the Home.html into the #content div.
[09:20:29] <gianbalex> ok
[09:20:42] <kone> well, then you can see i do this
[09:20:43] <kone> $("a#single_image").fancybox();
[09:20:47] <rabbi1> gianbalex: logon first, and if all fields are true it should allow users to go to next tab. i.e. forgot password ...... (logon and password tabs are just example, literally, no meaning ) I want to use the same in all my tabs over complete project ...
[09:21:05] <kone> that id #"single_image" exist in the home.html but not in the index.html
[09:21:42] <kone> so when i try to get it first, it doesn't get anything. I need to execute this: $("a#single_image").fancybox(); just before the home.html loads
[09:21:58] <kone> do i need to modify this: $("#contenido").load("Home.html"); to get a callback function?
[09:22:18] <kone> and inside there set the single_image??
[09:22:34] <gianbalex> kone: try: $("button").click(function(){ $("#divToContent").load(function(){ $("#div a#single_image").function() }) }
[09:23:00] <gianbalex> sorry .load("page.html", function()
[09:23:10] <gianbalex> function is the callback after the ajax request is done
[09:23:13] <kone> what i said couple lines ago, isn't it?
[09:23:27] <kone> this: kone: do i need to modify this: $("#contenido").load("Home.html"); to get a callback function?
[09:24:47] <batdorf> systemfault: got it! I hadn't created the element I was trying to select yet. That's why it worked fine after everything loaded and the item was clicked. Such a brain fart error huh? ha ha. Anyway, your tip helped out. thanks
[09:25:08] <gianbalex> kone, use  $("#container").load("Home.html", function(){ ...your code here... } )
[09:25:20] <kone> yeah okey
[09:25:21] <kone> thx
[09:25:25] <gianbalex> :)
[09:28:10] <gianbalex> rabbi1, you ned 2 element (a or button) and 2 div
[09:28:17] <systemfault> batdorf: :D
[09:28:46] <gianbalex> add class to a ex: <a class="mytab login-tab"> <a class="mytab password-tab">
[09:29:24] <gianbalex> then get "click" event of mytab class: $("a.mytab").click(function(){}
[09:30:04] <gianbalex> in click function you need to get the class of clicked element
[09:30:14] <_cS_LP2> i can't get dialog.load to open just a div on a page rather than the entire page
[09:31:09] <gianbalex> then: if($(this).hasClass("login-tab"){ ... do login tab } elseif((this).hasClass("password-tab")){ ...do password tab }
[09:32:24] <gianbalex> this is the "fast" solution to your problem
[09:32:46] <systemfault> _cS: If you use .load, in the same string as the url, you can add a space then the selector of the element you want to get
[09:33:27] <systemfault> _cS: "http://www.rofl.lol #zomg" would load the element with id = 'zomg' from www.rofl.lol
[09:34:33] <_cS> i tried that
[09:35:43] <chasematt> How can I return the results of a jQuery find? I want to return the results of find("li").hasClass("active"), but I keep getting a return value of true...
[09:36:14] <_cS> http://pastebin.com/42Wk8wpm
[09:36:15] <__trev> var $active = $("li.active"); $active.length > 0
[09:36:19] <gianbalex> $("element li")
[09:36:32] <gianbalex> .active*
[09:36:36] <_cS> the link is at the bottom of the paste and it doesn't work
[09:36:42] <__trev> or just $active.length as your boolean tester
[09:36:44] <systemfault> chasematt: Why do you use hasClass then?
[09:36:47] <gianbalex> the same of __trev
[09:36:48] <chasematt> thanks all
[09:36:51] <chasematt> :)
[09:36:55] <gianbalex> :)
[09:38:43] <_cS> systemfault.. does it not work if you use this.href?
[09:39:26] <systemfault> _cS: Depending on the context of this‚Ä¶ it will get the whole page?
[09:39:47] <systemfault> _cS: You said you wanted only a div of the requested page
[09:39:48] <_cS> it hangs at showing the spinner
[09:39:56] <_cS> yeah ya see the link at the bottom, that's in my html
[09:40:11] <_cS> i did it so all <a>'s with class="ajax" load a dialog window
[09:40:25] <_cS> not sure if that matters
[09:41:11] <_cS> it's the plus sign on the bottom grey bar of this page: http://objectiveli.org:3000/goals/13
[09:41:35] <_cS> without the space and #modal-layout in the href, it loads the entire page
[09:41:55] <rabbi1> gianbalex|afk: complete miss understanding..... sorry
[09:42:23] <systemfault> _cS: I don't use jQueryUI :/ So I cannot really help you for that
[09:42:30] <_cS> doh
[09:42:39] <_cS> well thanks anyway
[09:42:50] <rabbi1> gianbalex|afk: http://professionalaspnet.com/archive/2010/05/12/jQuery-Tutorial_3A00_-Validation-with-the-jQuery-UI-Tabs-Widget.aspx
[09:42:53] <systemfault> _cS: One thing I would try though is to load the markup without the dialog to see if it works
[09:43:01] <rabbi1> gianbalex|afk: ^^ this is exactly i am looking for ...
[09:43:18] <systemfault> _cS: If it does, I would then try to load the markup in a hidden div then make a dialog out of it
[09:43:21] <_cS> yeah it works: http://objectiveli.org:3000/goals/13/objectives/new
[09:43:57] <_cS> well i cant use a hidden div because of the app structure on the backend
[09:44:37] <systemfault> _cS: You could create it client-side
[09:45:11] <systemfault> 1) create a hidden div and append it to the body 2) .load the markup in it 3)create the jQueryUI dialog
[09:45:43] <systemfault> But hmm, you're sure that jQueryUI dialog doesn't have a similar feature to .load that would solve all your problems?
[09:46:06] <_cS> it may

[10:02:45] <Berniee> hello
[10:03:10] <majestic_12> hi everybody I have a problem with a php script
[10:03:35] <majestic_12> this is the problem... I have a table
[10:03:49] <rabbi1> what is event and ui in $('#example').bind('tabsselect', function(event, ui)  ?
[10:03:56] <majestic_12> and a form for every row (tr)
[10:04:43] <majestic_12> I use the jquery form from http://malsup.com/jquery/form
[10:05:32] <batdorf> kolix: it looks like the background image is fading in on top of the logo
[10:05:58] <majestic_12> the script adds new tr's (with it's form) using jquery too
[10:06:36] <majestic_12> the problems is that those forms added through jquery don't work
[10:07:35] <majestic_12> I think those forms have not been added to the dom...
[10:08:10] <batdorf> kolix: a quick fix is to set the z-index on that background image to -1
[10:09:16] <majestic_12> can anyone of you please help with this?
[10:11:04] <majestic_12> 			$('form.edit_atr').ajaxForm({

[10:31:48] <jonathancutrell> Heylo
[10:35:06] <Berniee> hey
[10:35:13] <Berniee> if anyone around to help give me a shout pls
[10:39:10] <mukwenhac> hi!
[10:40:32] <Berniee> hey
[10:40:42] <mukwenhac> I have a form that displays in an page overlay. I would like to find out if it's possible to use $.get() without specifying the url to which to send to. does this default to the page the overlay happens on?
[10:42:03] <mukwenhac> IF NOT, does jquery have any sort of knowing the current page ... a placeholder I can use for the url part. I want the $.get result set for the page the overlays happens on
[11:12:47] <malinens> hi guys!  I have alert box at the end of click event but it is called almost instantly (It is most probably because there are some asynhronous stuff going on). how to call alert box after all these asynhronous tasks?
[11:14:05] <__trev> You must call the alert in one of the async methods call backs
[11:16:08] <shoky> Berniee: hy
[11:17:43] <shoky> mukwenhac: not sure what you mean.. why would you want $.get without a url ?
[12:36:24] <fatninja> I have $.get("link", function(data)) {
[12:36:33] <fatninja> and I process data as string , data.split, etc etc
[12:36:36] <fatninja> in chrome it works
[12:36:39] <fatninja> in firefox it does not
[12:36:46] <fatninja> I tried casting it to String(data), it still didn't work
[12:37:45] <shoky> ?doesntwork
[12:37:48] <shoky> :\

[12:38:29] <shoky> ?doesn't work
[12:38:30] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[12:39:10] <asciidisco> @fatninja do you work with a webserver or do you use the file protocol to open your html file in the browser?
[12:39:35] <shoky> ?' '

[12:41:33] <fatninja> the thing is
[12:41:43] <fatninja> in firefox, it doesn't "Get" the right file
[12:41:48] <fatninja> it might have something to do with my server
[12:42:53] <asciidisco> @fatninja have you checked firebugs network panel to see what firefox actually tries to load?
[12:43:20] <fatninja> the problem was that firefox archives text files, and set the content-type to plain text
[12:43:33] <fatninja> when I wanted to get my data
[12:43:39] <fatninja> now I've set it to text/html and it works
[13:05:05] <megalomania> is this correctly translated from coffee to js? http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1026080330
[13:06:27] <chilversc> megalomania: other than forgetting property: "name", that looks fine
[13:10:30] <Kaltiz> How can I execute a function everytime a select element changes?
[13:11:00] <megalomania> Kaltiz: the change() handler?
[13:11:15] <Kaltiz> Not working for me ):
[13:11:22] <Kaltiz> $('#pickUpLoc').change(function(){
[13:11:22] <Kaltiz> 		$('#test').text($('#pickUpLoc').val());
[13:11:22] <Kaltiz> 	})
[13:11:23] <Kaltiz> 	.change();
[13:13:37] <luchenbill> are there any good tutorials for a drag and drop functionality
[13:13:43] <shoky> ?demo @ Kaltiz
[13:13:43] <bot-t> Kaltiz, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:15:31] <chilversc> Kaltiz: define not working as well
[13:16:22] <Kaltiz> http://jsfiddle.net/LT8YF/
[13:18:18] <chilversc> Kaltiz: you forgot to select jQuery on the left, default is mootools
[13:18:32] <chilversc> Kaltiz: though it works fine for me, so again, describe "does not work"
[13:19:16] <Kaltiz> Hmm it is working there :o
[13:19:16] <chilversc> http://jsfiddle.net/LT8YF/1/ updated to use jQuery
[13:19:27] <Kaltiz> just not in my project :L
[13:19:31] <Kaltiz> as is always the case
[13:19:47] <chilversc> Kaltiz: could you be getting a script error or something before that line of code? if so then that could abort the script thus the change handler is never registered
[13:20:14] <chilversc> Kaltiz: time to break out the web inspector, look for errors, and place some breakpoints
[13:24:17] <Kaltiz> :S
[13:24:32] <tw2113> mmm inspector tools
[13:24:51] <Kaltiz> Also I just ran my project online a that site
[13:24:53] <Kaltiz> works fine
[13:25:01] <Kaltiz> on my web sever it breaks ):
[13:25:19] <chilversc> I seriously can't remember how I ever used to cope before the web inspector and having actual breakpoints
[13:25:46] <Kaltiz> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL "
[13:25:49] <Kaltiz> What does this mean?
[13:26:04] <shoky> that you need to click on it to see where it comes from
[13:26:04] <chilversc> Kaltiz: just that, the syntax is wrong, it found a " where a " is not allow
[13:26:39] <Kaltiz> Is this right syntax?
[13:26:39] <Kaltiz> $('input[name="pickUpAirline"]')
[13:26:48] <shoky> ye
[13:28:50] <chilversc> you know, its a shame we don't have separate keys for begin quote, end quote, then this whole problem of nested quotes wouldn't exist
[13:29:54] <luchenbill> hey guys, how can I get these items on the left, drag and dropped into the content on the right? http://jsfiddle.net/upaRD/7/
[13:30:29] <chilversc> luchenbill: um, I can't see what you've tried so far, or what you're having trouble with
[13:31:06] <shoky> umm luchenbill maybe take a look at jquery ui draggable/droppable ?
[13:31:19] <chilversc> or possibly sortable depending on what you want
[13:31:33] <luchenbill> okay thanks, i'm new to jquery and I just need a bit of guidance! :D i'll check it out!
[13:33:18] <luchenbill> wow so it's somewhat as simple as this: http://jsfiddle.net/upaRD/8/
[13:33:27] <luchenbill> not necessarily what I want, but i'm sure I can build off it
[13:33:45] <shoky> ;]
[13:33:50] <luchenbill> :D
[13:33:53] <Kaltiz> :S
[13:34:07] <Kaltiz> I moved the script to a seperate tag down the bottow of the file
[13:34:10] <Kaltiz> why does it run now?
[13:34:38] <shoky> we cant answer that for you without seeing the before/after
[13:34:45] <shoky> before you had wrong syntax
[13:34:48] <shoky> now you have right syntax.
[13:35:30] <jita> .val() seems to give inconsistent result when the content is reloaded with ajax
[13:36:15] <jita> although the content is reloaded with new value using ajax
[13:36:17] <luchenbill> is there a way to make it somewhat "snap into" some sort of fixed area once it hits the right container? so they are not all jumbled up? perhapse maybe re-size the items once dropped?
[13:36:26] <jita> it still refers to the older value in the script
[13:36:30] <jita> how to tackle that ?
[13:36:55] <shoky> jita: .val() is consistent with the elements value
[13:37:24] <shoky> at the time of the .val() call
[13:37:55] <shoky> luchenbill: read the full docs for draggable & droppable
[13:37:56] <jita> shoky, in my script when i try to do console.log(foo.val()) in the script, it actually logs 2 values at a time, the older and the newer value, why so /
[13:38:06] <luchenbill> yes sir, my bad
[13:38:26] <shoky> jita: foo is probably a jq object wrapping two different elements. the old one and the new one
[13:39:20] <shoky> hmm disregard that sorry
[13:39:20] <jita> shoky, its the input fetched using jquery selector $('#low-duration').val()
[13:39:39] <shoky> i confused .val() and .text()
[13:40:14] <shoky> jita:  how did you change the element's value ?
[13:41:04] <amh345> im trying to see if a function is available to me.   it's for client side validations. in chrome console im running $('#submit_order').validate();   and i have an included file with an $.fn.validate = function() { ‚Ä¶ } .   however, when i try that validate(); method, i return TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'validate'.   am i calling that method incorrectly?
[13:42:17] <jita> shoky, $("#filter-results").html(response)
[13:42:33] <shoky> jita: .html doesn't change its value
[13:42:37] <shoky> it changes its innerHTML
[13:43:02] <shoky> jita: uhh sorry thats different elements
[13:43:40] <shoky> jita: anyway its hard to help without a demo/paste or something
[13:43:50] <shoky> jsfiddle would be best
[13:44:34] <shoky> amh345: you're calling it correctly. you must've not included the necessary js.. or included it wrong somehow i donno
[13:49:42] <jita> shoky, different elements /
[13:49:45] <jita> shoky, different elements ?
[14:00:49] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon all, If you have html markup that includes attributes like data-method='doSomething' and you want to be able to call the "doSomething" method when that element is "clicked" for example, how can you set that up?
[14:01:47] <Whirl3d> In other words, how can I change the string into a method?
[14:04:15] <systemfault> omg‚Ä¶ le hack
[14:04:31] <systemfault> You can do that if you know the name of the parent object of that method :/
[14:04:50] <systemfault> myObject[doSomething]() ?
[14:07:17] <Whirl3d> grrr. okay, I guess it's just a senseless switch loop then. THanks for the reply systemfault
[14:13:24] <shoky> why switch loop?
[14:13:44] <luchenbill> okay so I have tried quite a few things, but i'm still struggling... http://jsfiddle.net/upaRD/10/ all i'm trying to accomplish is, when you click on a box on the left, I would like the container on the right to change bg color to show that you are going to drag it there... I would also like to drop the items into that container and have them stuck there, I will implement a remove button later... I don't really see any good examp
[14:16:04] <luchenbill> oh I believe I just found a different option...
[14:16:17] <shoky> what's .productContainer ?
[14:17:31] <luchenbill> there is a #productContainer div on the right, which would act as the area to drop stuff into it, and there is a .product class which are the items
[14:17:39] <chilversc> Whirl3d: doesn't need a switch loop, you can create a binding like that in about 3 lines
[14:19:19] <shoky> luchenbill: that #productContainer div is empty and not visible
[14:19:45] <shoky> luchenbill: http://jsfiddle.net/upaRD/11/
[14:20:07] <shoky> luchenbill: also you didnt answer what's .productContainer
[14:20:14] <luchenbill> lmao again with the LOL sipmle stupid ass mistake
[14:21:07] <luchenbill> well I guess it's a fail
[14:21:16] <luchenbill> fml
[14:21:22] <shoky> wat
[14:21:57] <luchenbill> I called it as a class and not a div.. selector fail
[14:22:08] <shoky> o that. ye
[14:22:57] <luchenbill> and also the stupid fact that I styled the rightFlot or whatever and not the productContainer
[14:23:31] <shoky> yea so css fail, that's fine ;P yuo got the draggable/droppable right, pretty quickly
[14:23:35] <shoky> you're fine ;P
[14:24:30] <luchenbill> umm not quite I think
[14:24:33] <luchenbill> I'm working on it though
[14:24:34] <luchenbill> :)
[14:27:11] <pencilcheck> hey
[14:27:19] <pencilcheck> how do I stringify a jquery object from selector?
[14:27:42] <pencilcheck> the error says converting circular structure to JSON
[14:30:55] <Whirl3d> shoky, chillversc, I was looking for a way to encapsulate the method for a series of buttons in the markup... so, for example, the "next" button would have data-method="nextSlide" in it's markup and then one script would handle all of those types of buttons by calling the method in their data-method attribute
[14:33:51] <youngin> http://www.thathipsterporn.org/page/27
[14:33:54] <youngin> dayyyyyyyyyum!!
[14:34:16] <shoky> Whirl3d: yep, so why not do it like systemfault suggested ?
[14:34:27] <shoky> Whirl3d: with bracket notation
[14:34:47] <Whirl3d> Not sure what the parent object would be? document?
[14:35:07] <shoky> if you don't have such a parent object, then first of all you probably should..
[14:35:19] <shoky> i mean, where is that doSomething  method defined?
[14:35:33] <shoky> its a property of some object, no ?
[14:35:39] <luchenbill> okay I think i'm getting closer... how can I now make it stick in the right container once it's dragged into it? http://jsfiddle.net/upaRD/14/
[14:35:48] <Whirl3d> in my gallery script
[14:36:05] <chilversc> Whirl3d: well that's up to you and your design, that's the only part to this that is at all challenging, how to identify which object to bind to
[14:36:09] <Whirl3d> I havne't made it into a plugin yet, just starting from scratch.
[14:36:35] <jonocosa> Hello is there a good jquery ajax tutorial ? Im new in jquery
[14:36:58] <chilversc> Whirl3d: for me, I did this when setting up the app by having a function bindEvents(target, selector) method, that would look through all items in the selector for data-method, binding them to the target
[14:37:07] <shoky> Whirl3d: worst case you could just define var methods = { nextSlide: function() { ... }, doSomething: function() { ... } }
[14:37:55] <Whirl3d> chilversc, shoky, great suggestions. I'll play with them both and see which works better for me. thanks.
[14:38:04] <shoky> ?jqfundamentals @ jonocosa
[14:38:06] <bot-t> shoky, Couldn't find "jqfundamentals" in jQuery Docs.
[14:38:17] <shoky> ?g jqfundamentals @ jonocosa
[14:38:18] <bot-t> jonocosa, jQuery Fundamentals - http://jqfundamentals.com/
[14:38:48] <Whirl3d> does $.extend copy methods and can I extend an object literal with the jquery methods useing jquery as the second attribute in extend?
[14:39:37] <jonocosa> Thank :) shoky bot-t
[14:39:38] * bot-t sighs
[14:39:48] * luchenbill humps bot-t 
[14:39:52] <luchenbill> hehe
[14:42:05] <Whirl3d> how do you decide what scope to use for your methods? I keep waffling between having all of my methods handled by the "gallery" object, but then occasionally, I thnk that having the slide be responsible for it's own "enter" and "exit" methods is best/provides more functionality...
[14:44:09] <Whirl3d> I've looked at so many gallery plugins and it appears that none of them are written corectly. They all have very specific "tricks" that they use and none of them seem modular or structured correctly.
[14:46:13] <kbni-air> greetings
[14:47:30] <kbni-air> if I have a bunch of divs, say 6: div.item div.item div.item div.item_active div.item div.item - can I somehow get the next *visible* item after div.item_active?
[14:47:59] <kbni-air> I could iterate over $(div.item_active).next() until I get a visibile item, but that doesn't seem sensible
[14:48:10] <Whirl3d> $('div.item_active").next(":visible")  ?
[14:49:45] <kbni-air> Whirl3d: that doesn't seem to work unless the next item is ALSO visible, rather than grabbing the next visible item
[14:49:46] <Whirl3d> sry
[14:49:51] <Whirl3d> nextUntil
[14:50:08] <Whirl3d> $("div.item_active').nextUntil(":visible")
[14:50:09] <kbni-air> aaaah
[14:50:11] <kbni-air> thanks!
[14:50:31] <kbni-air> wow, that's faster
[14:52:29] <luchenbill> anyone :|
[14:52:33] <kbni-air> Whirl3d: looking at jquery.com - I don't see the one that gets teh until bit?
[14:53:22] <Whirl3d> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-untils-plugin/
[14:54:26] <Whirl3d> luchenbill, what did you need? Besides a condom for poor little bot-t?
[14:55:12] <luchenbill> bahaha sorry bot-t :P well i'm trying to get the item to drop into my container on the right hand side... I feel like i'm close, but that probably means i'm not even close at all http://jsfiddle.net/upaRD/14/
[14:55:53] <luchenbill> I have it set so if you don't happen to get it on the right hand side, it will revert back to it's place... but I would like it to actually drop once it does get to the right hand side
[14:59:40] <Whirl3d> luchenbill, I've never used droppable before, I am at a loss Im afraid.
[15:00:14] <luchenbill> dohh i'm new to jquery in general so i'm kind of at a loss as well
[15:00:21] <chilversc> luchenbill: I'm not sure you ment to make the green box draggable :)
[15:00:53] <Whirl3d> even removing that, it still doesn't work
[15:01:40] <luchenbill> how is the green box draggable?
[15:01:56] <luchenbill> oops I forgot to update
[15:02:00] <chilversc> luchenbill: you've set the ".product" to revert on drop, which is why its returning to where it came from
[15:02:00] <luchenbill> yeah I realized that awhile ago
[15:02:48] <luchenbill> chilversc: right, but I was wondering if I could have it like that, but once it hits the green box area, it would then drop into that box, and not revert to it's original spot.. so just in case it was not dragged into the green box, it would indeed revert where it should
[15:02:52] <chilversc> luchenbill: have you looked through the droppable examples on the site for any that have a behaviour similar to what you want?
[15:03:11] <chilversc> luchenbill: http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/
[15:03:20] <luchenbill> yes sir
[15:03:59] <chilversc> luchenbill: I think this is the one you want, http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#revert
[15:04:05] <luchenbill> the only one I see even close to what I would like is http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/shopping-cart.html
[15:04:23] <youngin> Whirl3d: hey man you take on jobs?
[15:04:37] <chilversc> luchenbill: view the source on that (via the link in page) and pay attention to #draggable2
[15:04:38] <youngin> too good to answer me in private huh
[15:04:54] <luchenbill> oh sweet that's a good example
[15:05:20] <chilversc> luchenbill: the only thing I'm then not sure about is how to get them to align nicely on drop
[15:05:41] <luchenbill> I believe that has something to do with the grid section
[15:05:53] <luchenbill> which I had on there, but I wanted to get the functionality before I worried about the style :)
[15:06:16] <Whirl3d> youngin, why you wanna treat someone like that? I am in the middle of a couple of big projects and didn't even know that you violated the rules of this channel and sent me a pm without asking. How could I be too good to ignore you. I just hadn't noticed you.
[15:06:16] <chilversc> ah, for alining look at http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#photo-manager
[15:06:45] <chilversc> seems it just a case of handling the drop event and taking over what happens
[15:06:57] <youngin> its a rule of this channel?
[15:07:13] <youngin> aint nothing wrong with walking up to a random person on the street and start talking
[15:07:22] <youngin> in fact such behavior is admired
[15:07:28] <chilversc> luchenbill: though depending on what you want, there is an overlap between draggable/droppable and sortable, http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists
[15:07:32] <youngin> so excuse me for trying to do what they do in real life
[15:07:43] <Whirl3d> not where I come from. InAtlanta, it's not advised.
[15:10:50] <chilversc> youngin: yeah, but the problem there is in real life you can already see if someone is busy, or someone else is talking to them, in irc you can't and you end up with a few people getting PMed by everyone
[15:13:04] <luchenbill> i'm sure there is a bot command that will explain that haha
[15:13:14] <luchenbill> bot-t: help
[15:13:14] <bot-t> Get FREE A++ HELP - http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc
[15:13:46] <luchenbill> boom I didn't even know the command, and there it is :D
[15:23:33] <luchenbill> I think i'm getting closer http://jsfiddle.net/upaRD/17/
[15:34:58] <fatninja> I bring new elements to the page by using ajax
[15:35:09] <fatninja> I want to use some hovers
[15:35:24] <fatninja> $("element").on('handler','fund'); just doesn't seem to work
[15:35:25] <fatninja> at all
[15:35:36] <fatninja> I've put
[15:35:42] <shoky> 'fund' ?
[15:35:52] <fatninja> $("div").on('click', function(){
[15:35:53] <fatninja>     alert("i'm angry");
[15:35:53] <fatninja> });
[15:35:55] <fatninja> still nothing
[15:36:02] <fatninja> I meant func
[15:36:03] <shoky> yes you need to delegate the events
[15:36:11] <fatninja> delegate ?
[15:36:12] <shoky> to an element that is already in the dom when you call .on
[15:36:26] <fatninja> so the element must be in the dom
[15:36:42] <fatninja> let me see
[15:36:43] <shoky> something like: $('#containerElement').on('click', '.myClickedElementClass', function() { .... } )
[15:36:53] <shoky> read about .on() and event delegation
[15:37:00] <shoky> here: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://api.jquery.com/on
[15:38:07] <chilversc> you don't need to delegate the events, it all depends on what you're doing
[15:38:25] <chilversc> eg, you could have, $('#someButton').on('click', function() { ... });
[15:38:32] <shoky> if he wants to setup the handlers before the elements are in the dom.. then yes, he does
[15:38:58] <chilversc> right, if, so need to clarify that point first
[15:39:01] <fatninja> shaky, but of course , thanks for illuminating me

[16:08:23] <LoneStar99> how would i get the id of a "<div>" on click?
[16:09:03] <dabear> ?remove @ LoneStar99
[16:09:04] <bot-t> LoneStar99, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[16:09:17] <tw2113> he wasn't getting rid of anything
[16:09:51] <systemfault> :P
[16:11:35] <LoneStar99> yeah not trying to get rid of anything, want to capture the div id when any div is clicked on
[16:13:35] <ill1cit> http://bit.ly/LX8rBF does this jquery work?
[16:15:14] <tw2113> i dunno, does it?
[16:15:39] <tw2113> they move on their own to me
[16:15:52] <tw2113> no console errors
[16:15:54] <ill1cit> can you not pull from side to side?
[16:16:09] <tw2113> arrows move things
[16:16:22] <ill1cit> cool thanks
[16:16:36] <ill1cit> what you think of my city i live in?
[16:16:45] <tw2113> looks like a city :)
[16:17:17] <ill1cit> Best African City
[16:17:37] <systemfault> Is there such a thing? :/
[16:17:51] <ill1cit> click and see for yourself ;)
[16:20:19] <systemfault> The image slider works fine.. if that's all
[16:20:27] <ill1cit> yes thank you
[16:20:43] <scathen^C> if i create a jquery(some html), and then check if it contains some element type (like an iframe for example). How do i strip everything outside of this element?
[16:21:25] <systemfault> scathen^C: You just .remove() it from the fragment?
[16:21:44] <scathen^C> but i want to do the opposite of remove, like remove everything but
[16:22:11] <systemfault> scathen^C: You remove the element‚Ä¶ then forget about the rest?
[16:22:28] <scathen^C> ahh remove returns the removed thing?
[16:22:29] <systemfault> .remove() doesn't destroy the element
[16:22:37] <scathen^C> awesome, cheers mate
[16:22:45] <systemfault> :)
[16:25:39] <white_magic> hi
[16:25:56] <white_magic> anyone here knowledgeable about sending POST data using jquery?
[16:26:43] <systemfault> What do you want to do?
[16:27:48] <white_magic> well, i'm trying to send some post data to a PHP form. What confuses me is the path to use
[16:28:04] <systemfault> white_magic: The path?
[16:28:10] <white_magic> let me give an example
[16:28:15] <tw2113> ajax
[16:28:47] <white_magic> for example, let's say the php form path is this: www.thesite.com/handlers/the_form.php
[16:28:58] <LoneStar99> need to capture id of element clicked on... not sure how to do it with jquery
[16:29:11] <tw2113> LoneStar99 clicking ANY div or a specific one?
[16:29:24] <white_magic> so, would this be how I send the data: $.post("handlers/the_form.php", strData); ?
[16:29:28] <LoneStar99> tw2113: anyone
[16:29:37] <white_magic> lonestar99: one sec, this should be very easy
[16:29:43] <LoneStar99> k thanks
[16:29:59] <tw2113> $('div').on('click', function ({})
[16:30:04] <tw2113> crap
[16:30:12] <tw2113> something like that to start
[16:30:17] <tw2113> i hit enter too fast
[16:30:56] <tw2113> $('div').on('click', function () { //grab ID attr here });
[16:31:23] <LoneStar99> tw2113: ok sweet let me try that
[16:31:29] <systemfault> :/
[16:31:40] <LoneStar99> thanks
[16:31:43] <tw2113> you'll likely use 'this' in there
[16:31:47] <white_magic> so anyone know how I should send the form data in the example I provided?
[16:32:05] <systemfault> Attaching an event handler on every divs on a page‚Ä¶ what a wonderfully bad idea.
[16:32:49] <systemfault> white_magic: strData?
[16:33:04] <white_magic> assume strData is a string I have already formatted to contain the correct data
[16:33:18] <systemfault> white_magic: Then you got it
[16:33:30] <white_magic> damn it, i wonder why it's not working then
[16:34:36] <luchenbill> systemfault: with the drag/drop function(s) of jquery ui i'm trying to get this "green right container area" to have these items snap into place... i'm getting close but i'm still failing. sorry to highlight your nick, but i'm still awaiting someone to help :P http://jsfiddle.net/upaRD/17/
[16:34:44] * tw2113 doesn't know why LoneStar99 wants to grab the ID of a div whenever he clicks on any of them
[16:34:56] <white_magic> because HE CAN, OK?
[16:34:58] <white_magic> it's a free country..
[16:35:02] <white_magic> jk..
[16:35:05] <systemfault> luchenbill: I fail hard at D&D because I never needed to play with it :(
[16:35:27] <systemfault> tw2113: Even then.. you would use event delegation and not standard handlers.
[16:35:28] <luchenbill> ahh :) it's okay I just feel like i'm 99% there, can't get there though
[16:36:00] <tw2113> *shrug* i spit out thoughts on how i'd do it at first, and if someone had a better/more efficient way, i'd learn and go from there
[16:36:01] <LoneStar99> tw2113: working on a web service, just trying out different solutions
[16:36:03] <systemfault> $(document.body).on('click', 'div', function() { var id = $(this).attr('id');  ‚Ä¶.   });
[16:36:58] <LoneStar99> thanks works
[16:41:24] <Whirl3d> luchenbill, that looks like a bug to me. I mean why should your drag start be offset so much when you try to drag the already dropped object?
[16:41:57] <luchenbill> Whirl3d: I essentially just took this example from the ui site :|
[16:42:09] <luchenbill> i'm new to jquery and I have no idea what i'm getting into apperently
[16:48:54] <ryanaz> I want to have a dialog('open') only after a specific animate() finishes... how do I do that?
[16:50:17] <luchenbill> i'm guessing with a callback function
[16:50:34] <luchenbill> animate( blah, function() { dialog }
[16:50:40] <luchenbill> )};
[16:51:13] <ryanaz> ..trying
[16:53:24] <ryanaz> Bingo!
[16:53:31] <ryanaz> luchenbill: worked perfect
[16:53:39] <ryanaz> i'm new to javascript (no duh)
[16:53:45] <luchenbill> haha great! :) me too sir
[16:53:58] <luchenbill> but I read about callbacks
[16:54:22] <luchenbill> a function that will run only once the parent is completed or something :P
[16:57:16] <jcontra> linchenbill--  you're right
[16:57:35] <jcontra> err... lunchenbill
[16:57:47] <luchenbill> :) yay
[16:58:06] <systemfault> The new sexy way is by using the promise interface though :P
[16:58:12] <jcontra> the syntax is typically .animationFunction(parameters, optional callback function)
[16:58:32] <luchenbill> systemfault:  like what?
[16:59:39] <shoky> luchenbill:  http://jsfiddle.net/upaRD/18/
[16:59:54] <jcontra> promise functions are used to call a function when another function 1) takes time to complete or 2) could succeed or fail
[17:00:16] <jcontra> change the or to an and... it really should be used if both are true
[17:00:19] <luchenbill> holy crap shoky! thx!
[17:00:23] <shoky> ;p
[17:00:25] <jcontra> to use in this case, I think it would be overkill
[17:00:26] <luchenbill> now i'm going to read up on why it's working :)
[17:00:33] <shoky> ;>
[17:01:57] <systemfault> luchenbill: http://jsfiddle.net/Hp2bZ/
[17:02:47] <systemfault> luchenbill: nicer when split like that: http://jsfiddle.net/Hp2bZ/1/
[17:03:13] <shoky> or just: http://jsfiddle.net/Hp2bZ/2/
[17:03:35] <systemfault> :D
[17:03:40] <luchenbill> that is sexy! so is having the 2000 ms like that something like a callback?
[17:04:00] <systemfault> luchenbill: A callback is function :/
[17:04:01] <shoky> the callback is what's handed to .done(...)
[17:04:01] <luchenbill> btw you and your lol's haha just made me lol
[17:04:26] <systemfault> Gotta love the lol's
[17:04:33] <shoky> lulzy
[17:05:01] <luchenbill> nvm I just noticed the 2000 was a property of the animate
[17:05:26] <shoky> an argument, yes
[17:07:42] <luchenbill> so essentially the .when is only executed once the function is completed exactly like the callback example but more modern or the next type of technique
[17:07:48] <luchenbill> err .done
[17:08:31] <systemfault> luchenbill: Pretty much everything that is async can be handled with jQ promises now
[17:08:48] <systemfault> animations‚Ä¶ ajax calls‚Ä¶ you own functions if you want
[17:08:55] <systemfault> Pure sexyness
[17:09:11] <luchenbill> oh yeah for sure I like it
[17:09:18] <luchenbill> cleans the code up quite a bit
[17:09:30] <luchenbill> especially the second way you did it with the function as a variable
[17:11:32] <luchenbill> haha anyways this made me forget about my task at hand haha back to the D&D... now I just need to figure out how to re-size the object once it hits the right pane
[17:11:34] <luchenbill> :D
[17:20:27] <shoky> luchenbill this is a good read if you want more info  http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[17:28:10] <luchenbill> awesome tyvm i love good reads
[17:28:16] <luchenbill> for me they are hard to come by though
[17:28:46] <luchenbill> seems like googling or at least googling without the correct terms provides a lot of nonsense sometimes
[17:29:19] <luchenbill> if I at least knew the correct terminology idk i'm just a noob haha
[17:38:07] <shoky> in comes IRC
[17:38:29] <luchenbill> :)
[17:38:53] <luchenbill> I just try not to be too noobish and actually attempt half assed before I ask a question, so I don't wind up on bash haha
[17:40:39] <systemfault> It's okay to ask questions as long as they're not stupid (Stupid meaning that a simple search on google can give you the answer)
[17:41:00] <luchenbill> yes sir :)
[17:56:42] <luchenbill> so with our little example of D&D, i'm thinking of a way to possibly add a little close button to the items which would be in the productContainer, i'm thinking of simply appending an <a href> to it, while the dropable is running, then maybe a event listener to remove that item and place it back on the left hand side... would this be a good logical way of doing it?
[17:57:39] <shoky> why is the close button in the productContainer
[17:57:44] <shoky> and not on the products themselves
[17:57:44] <shoky> ?
[18:00:11] <luchenbill> yeah that's what I was trying to say shoky, I was simply thinking of creating the a href on the         drop: function( event, ui ) {             ui.draggable.detach()                 .css({left:0,top:0, width:190, height:50}).appendTo(this);         } function
[18:00:31] <luchenbill> because I see the css was able to append there so I must be able to append html as well
[18:00:40] <shoky> yea you can append html
[18:02:01] <shoky> you can also just put the close-button div, hidden, inside the product divs html to begin with
[18:02:11] <shoky> and just show it in the drop handler
[18:02:47] <luchenbill> ahh great idea
[18:02:48] <luchenbill> :D
[18:20:12] <luchenbill> hey shoky i'm probably doing something stupid again, but I can't seem to get it working... http://jsfiddle.net/upaRD/28/
[18:26:45] <shoky> mm
[18:26:48] <shoky> $('.product div a').addClass('show');
[18:26:56] <shoky> what does this line do, sir
[18:28:09] <shoky> @ luchenbill
[18:28:42] <luchenbill> select the a inside product->div and add class show which is adding a display: block on to the a?
[18:29:01] <luchenbill> oh SHOOT
[18:29:02] <shoky> it selects ALL a's which are inside div's which are inside .product's
[18:29:04] <shoky> first of all.
[18:29:07] <luchenbill> i'm display none on the div, not the a
[18:29:11] <shoky> then there's that :)
[18:29:20] <luchenbill> >_<
[18:29:33] <luchenbill> my brain is spinning haha first time jquery and i'm soo noobish
[18:30:44] <shoky> i would do:  http://jsfiddle.net/upaRD/30/
[18:33:56] <luchenbill> would you mind explaining the chaining of all those functions, how it works? is there documentation on it?
[18:34:18] <luchenbill> .find().show().end().appendTo() etc
[18:34:33] <systemfault> .end() is sooooo evil
[18:34:34] <systemfault> :/
[18:34:36] <shoky> it'd be best to read the docs on all those
[18:35:14] <luchenbill> yeah that's what i'm already doing, I just didn't know if these were just functions of .detatch() or whatever
[18:35:37] <luchenbill> detach**
[18:35:56] <shoky> most simple jq methods just return the jq object they were called on
[18:36:12] <shoky> like detach, show, append, appendTo
[18:36:48] <shoky> but find() is one of several methods that changes the returned jq obj based on what you're find()ing
[18:37:23] <shoky> and then if you want to keep chaining to the original object, you need .end()
[18:37:40] <shoky> systemfault: why u no like dis?
[18:38:02] <systemfault> shoky: I think of chaining as being elegant as long as you don't abuse it :P
[18:38:13] <systemfault> .end() is abuse :P
[18:38:38] <systemfault> Of course, it's just my opinion :D
[18:39:50] <shoky> fine ;P
[18:40:08] <systemfault> shoky: When I read code, my brain decomposes a function into small chunks that do a single thing...
[18:40:32] <systemfault> When you use .end().. you have a single statement that does multiple things so my brain hurt :P
[18:40:49] <shoky> that's what the indentation is for ;D
[18:42:01] <javalover> hey guys
[18:42:23] <javalover> i'm overriding $(window).scroll()   the problem is the page is still scrolling, is there a way to prevent the page from scrolling & just do my actions instead?
[18:42:25] <shoky> luchenbill:  that could've been written :  ui.draggable.detach().css({...}).appendTo(this).find('.close').hide();
[18:42:50] <shoky> luchenbill: but as systemfault points out, it'd prolly be nicer to just seperate this into 2 lines of code :P
[18:43:24] <luchenbill> it's good I was just trying to figure out what end did
[18:43:26] <shoky> javalover: you don't override $(window).scroll()
[18:43:37] <luchenbill> it's talking about looking at the object before stuff happens, and idk
[18:43:43] <luchenbill> it's making my brain hurt too haha
[18:43:57] <javalover> wait i fixed it
[18:44:01] <shoky> javalover $(window).scroll(...) is for handling the scroll event
[18:44:05] <javalover> i made the object that was glitching position fixed
[18:44:19] <javalover> the problem was I had a scrolling issue but switching to fixed fixes it
[18:45:09] <shoky> luchenbill: if i hadn't used .end() in the fiddle, and just done:     .find('.close').hide().appendTo(this)
[18:45:23] <shoky> luchenbill: then it would've appended the '.close' div instead of the product div
[18:45:40] <javalover> yeah I take it you can't actually overwrite the scroll then
[18:45:50] <javalover> but switching to fixed prevents the glitch so...alls well that ends well I guess
[18:46:01] <shoky> javalover: you can set $(window).scrollTop( ... )
[18:46:11] <javalover> well the thing is shoky...i'm controlling the scrolling myself
[18:46:26] <javalover> so having the object as fixed is ok, as it prevents scrolling of that object till I say so
[18:46:40] <luchenbill> ahh yeah I removed it from the code, and all that drops in the window is the ahref close
[18:46:54] <luchenbill> I have been messing with it seeing what the different functions do
[18:50:55] <shoky> .end()  "ends" the  .find()
[18:56:39] <luchenbill> ahh :)
[18:56:57] <luchenbill> okay i'm getting really close to getting the functionality completed http://jsfiddle.net/upaRD/33/
[18:57:24] <luchenbill> the only downfall is, you have to click the A to drag it correctly and get it to work right...
[18:58:07] <jim_r0x> hello fellas!
[19:00:24] <jim_r0x> any of you had problems with "slider effect" of the jQueryUI in Chrome? Some strange behavior, content arrives late in relation to the effect?
[19:01:06] <jim_r0x> happens with the chrome and opera
[19:02:57] <shoky> wat?
[19:04:57] <jim_r0x> I am developing a website that makes horizontal scrolling with the content centered, and I'm using the effect of slider jQueryUI...
[19:06:48] <shoky> what's a slider effect..
[19:09:52] <jim_r0x> shoky: visit this site with the Chrome browser and see what happens... www.trioctp.com.br
[19:10:51] <shoky> what happens...
[19:11:10] <shoky> you don't even have jquery UI included. what are you talking about ;\
[19:11:29] <jim_r0x> shoky: then you try with other browsers, internet explorer that crap works perfectly
[19:11:44] <shoky> i dont see any problem with chrome
[19:12:09] <jim_r0x> a problem of delay of the content
[19:12:23] <shoky> and you didnt say what the problem is, and you said jquery UI even tho you're not using it. basically you suck at explaining your issue
[19:12:24] <shoky> eh.
[19:12:28] <jim_r0x> happens in chrome and safari
[19:12:40] <shoky> delay of the content.. wtf does that mean
[19:13:06] <jim_r0x> yes I'm using, because it is ta loading inside an iframe
[19:13:16] <shoky> yeah, whatever.
[19:14:59] <luchenbill> looks like it's just fine here on chrome as well
[19:16:44] <Kaltiz> Is there anyway I can make the show hide not move around so much in this: http://jsfiddle.net/LT8YF/3/
[19:17:03] <jim_r0x> click on the menu several times on "SERVI«OS" and will see that the content coming from the right, the text has been delayed relative to the background
[19:38:17] <shoky> Kaltiz: you can have it be any way you want.. if you want full control use .animate
[19:38:38] <shoky> Kaltiz: also that code is ugly :(
[19:38:44] <Kaltiz> ): why?
[19:39:07] <shoky> first of all it'd be better to use ids for the inputs and select them by id
[19:39:24] <shoky> second, why are you fading things out on dom ready
[19:39:55] <shoky> third, have their parents parent have some class/id that you can select instead of .parent().parent() everywhere
[19:40:07] <Kaltiz> :L
[19:40:10] <shoky> etc :\
[19:40:13] <Kaltiz> Well the reason they are in doc ready
[19:40:30] <Kaltiz> was because it wasn't running unless the script was below the element it wanted.
[19:40:36] <shoky> wat
[19:40:44] <Kaltiz> I don't know :S
[19:40:53] <shoky> k ;P
[19:40:57] <Kaltiz> I had to move the script to the bottom of the html file for it to work.
[19:41:24] <Kaltiz> php uses names I am pretty sure :P
[19:41:25] <shoky> why do you want stuff to fade out when loading the page ?
[19:41:32] <shoky> names for what..
[19:41:54] <Kaltiz> for $_GET
[19:41:59] <Kaltiz> _POST*
[19:42:05] <shoky> what does that have to do with it
[19:42:18] <LoneStar99> have the following ->var b = '#' + currentId;  var a = $(b).html();  is that correct?
[19:42:36] <shoky> LoneStar99: does it work?
[19:42:41] <LoneStar99> nope
[19:42:54] <shoky> then something is not correct.
[19:43:17] <Kaltiz> also slideUp doesn't appear to work O.o
[19:43:22] <shoky> instead of asking if that is correct, why not ask about your issue
[19:43:34] <shoky> Kaltiz: it works fine.
[19:43:53] <Kaltiz> Can it slideUp over other elements
[19:43:54] <Kaltiz> ?
[19:43:59] <LoneStar99> shoky need $b to be a dynamic div
[19:44:07] <shoky> Kaltiz: what does that mean..
[19:44:31] <shoky> LoneStar99: $b ? dynamic div ?
[19:45:57] <systemfault> dynamic div, looks like a nice concept! What is it supposed to do?
[19:46:59] <LoneStar99> shoky, ok having an issue with --> $("#b") need "b" to a dynamic div....
[19:47:08] <Kaltiz> Shoky this is what I mean, the element doesn't slide up, it just disappears :(
[19:47:09] <Kaltiz> http://jsfiddle.net/LT8YF/3/
[19:47:17] <Kaltiz> http://jsfiddle.net/LT8YF/4/ **
[19:47:17] <shoky> LoneStar99  what you did with '#' + currentId   is fine
[19:47:43] <shoky> Kaltiz: have you read the docs for slideUp ?
[19:49:19] <shoky> Kaltiz: also you're using delay wrong..
[19:50:39] <systemfault> shoky: I've got a super promise question for you
[19:50:54] <shoky> oh my
[19:51:36] <systemfault> You can use $.when to do parallel execution‚Ä¶  but what if I want it serial? Is there anything more elegant than using .pipe?
[19:52:25] <Kaltiz> What's wrong with the slideUp tho?
[19:52:39] <shoky> hmm i dont really see pipe as inelegant. but i suppose you could use a queue
[19:53:05] <LoneStar99> shoky: here is my code --> http://jsfiddle.net/a37dn/2/
[19:53:40] <shoky> Kaltiz: animations dont work good on table rows
[19:54:03] <Kaltiz> Oh dang ):
[19:54:25] <LoneStar99> when "foo123" is clicked it should update "boo" with "click here" text
[19:54:45] <shoky> go for it.
[19:56:10] <LoneStar99> but does not work
[20:09:37] <shoky> that is sad.
[20:21:04] <LoneStar99> can't seem to figure out how to pass a dynamic div name to --> $(b).html(); "b" being dynamic....
[20:21:53] <LoneStar99> $("b".html();  will not work
[20:22:07] <balazs> is b a jQuery object or a DOM ?
[20:23:23] <shoky> LoneStar99: your issue is somewhere else, because you did that part fine
[20:23:39] <shoky> as i've already told you
[20:24:12] <LoneStar99> mh0 --> http://jsfiddle.net/a37dn/3/
[20:24:42] <shoky> what about it ?
[20:24:52] <shoky> you're not even using that b  variable
[20:25:30] <systemfault> WTH is that jsfiddle :/
[20:25:33] <LoneStar99> sorry was doing some testing --> http://jsfiddle.net/a37dn/4/
[20:25:35] <balazs> LoneStar99: what shoky says
[20:25:36] <systemfault> It has syntax errors in it
[20:26:06] <systemfault> LoneStar99: Don't you even check for errors? :(
[20:26:27] <systemfault> Your browser's console is your best friend...
[20:26:30] <systemfault> beside shoky
[20:27:24] <LoneStar99> opps forgot about web console,  have firebug on
[20:28:33] <systemfault> Anyway.. if you can fix your syntax error, your logic is good
[20:28:36] <systemfault> It will work
[20:30:05] <shoky> LoneStar99: click 'TidyUp'
[20:31:40] <LoneStar99> do not see any errors...
[20:32:41] <shoky> LoneStar99:  you have an extra   });   at the end
[20:34:14] <LoneStar99> oh yeah... ok jsfiddle working, now my code is still acting up...
[20:34:58] <shoky> dumdedum
[20:35:59] <LoneStar99> lol
[20:36:03] <LoneStar99> thanks
[20:37:48] <tw2113> chick here?
[20:38:47] <LoneStar99> shoky: here is my actual code still not working --> http://jsfiddle.net/a37dn/7/
[20:39:36] <tw2113> get rid of the extra });
[20:39:38] <systemfault> lulz...
[20:39:51] <systemfault> LoneStar99: Are you trolling or what?
[20:40:04] <systemfault> Tell us‚Ä¶ and spare our time.
[20:40:29] <LoneStar99> this one has --> $(document).ready(function() {
[20:40:43] <LoneStar99> trolling?
[20:40:53] <systemfault> LoneStar99: Your click handler does NOTHING
[20:40:54] <tw2113> http://jsfiddle.net/a37dn/8/
[20:40:58] <shoky> :\
[20:41:02] <tw2113> there you go
[20:41:42] <tw2113> here was your click line
[20:41:42] <tw2113> $('div').on('click', function() {});
[20:41:49] <tw2113> in version 7
[20:43:59] <LoneStar99> weird they  look the same to me...
[20:44:32] <tw2113> except mine works
[20:46:27] <LoneStar99> lol
[20:46:29] <LoneStar99> yeah
[20:51:26] <LoneStar99> thank you all
[21:16:59] <LoneStar99> how would I add a child node to an existing <div id="foo"></div> ?
[21:18:39] <bung> LoneStar99: append/prepend
[21:20:01] <LoneStar99> oh ok cool
[21:22:42] <LoneStar99> ok works great thanks
[21:31:50] <LoneStar99> is remove() opposite of append()?
[21:34:12] <Ziber> What's the best way to recall a function again? setTimeout()?
[21:35:09] <LoneStar99> or "setInterval"
[21:37:42] <Ziber> setTimeout(time, function())?
[21:37:44] <Whirl3d> setTimeout
[21:38:41] <Whirl3d> setTimeout(function(){},time);
[21:40:25] <bung> LoneStar99: remove is not exactly the opposite of append... append means add to the beginning... remove just removes, it doesnt care its position
[21:40:26] <Whirl3d> just remember if you encapsulate the function to use it's name , you should use clearTimeout() to clear it in case it gets called before the timeout times' out.
[21:41:04] <Whirl3d> append adds to the end. Prepend adds to the beginning, i thought.
[21:41:10] <LoneStar99> bung: ok sounds bueno,
[21:41:12] <LoneStar99> thanks
[21:41:15] <bung> LoneStar99: if you wanted to remove the first child.. $parent.children().first().remove();
[21:42:46] <LoneStar99> bung:  ok noted that thanks
[21:42:55] <bung> you could even make yourself a killFirstBorn() shortcut to do that haha
[21:44:36] <systemfault> function finalPlagueOfEgypt() ?
[21:47:08] <LoneStar99> k thanks
[23:24:31] <alcuadrado> is there a "deserialize" method?
[23:25:02] <Whirl3d> is there any cute way of doing something like: loadImage(url).then(continue); where continue finished the rest of the function which called loadImage()?
[23:25:31] <Whirl3d> alcuadrado, benAllman provides a deparam method on his site.
[23:25:41] <alcuadrado> great Whirl3d :D
[23:25:59] <alcuadrado> and I think the cutest way to make what you want is using an object callback
[23:26:35] <Whirl3d> Yerah, I got the deferreds working, I just didnt' want to split up my function...just put it on hold till the ajax call returned
[23:27:33] <alcuadrado> theres no way to do that in javascript, it could be implemented if we had coroutines, but we don't (maybe for good)
[23:28:55] <Whirl3d> That's cool. I have just found at least a dozen times that I work on something, get it going and THEN find out there's a really easy way to do it. LOL
[23:29:01] <Whirl3d> I guess not this time.
[23:30:58] <Whirl3d> although, I could check my div for data, if it doesn't exist, do the ajax call and re-call the function on success (which then would have the data, so skip the load). hrmmm...
[23:53:01] <aro> hai
[23:53:11] <aro> how do i get the current selected value of a group of radio buttons
[23:56:51] <javaninja> has anyone here ever had a successful website? like made money off it?
