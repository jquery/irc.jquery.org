[00:02:34] <Bustin> Hey there. New to jquery.. I'm working on a validation script, that will validate logins and signups. Now my questions is, am I going about this the right way? http://pastie.org/2733707  -  How do I add an error for the call back to the current code? Any help is appreciated thanks.
[00:04:33] <clarkfischer> Bustin, what do you mean 'an error for the callback to the current code'? Which part?
[00:36:42] <blazento> hi anyone familiar with the hoverintent plugin? My code here works but does not seem to respond to my timeout: 500... i try editing the times but it still takes the same amount of time for the event to fire. any ideas? https://gist.github.com/1303302
[00:40:44] <iYuri> hi there, I have a div with list of links (a href)
[00:40:58] <iYuri> when one is clicked, a page is loaded into another div
[00:41:16] <iYuri> how can I disable clicking on the other link TILL the page is fully loaded???
[00:41:58] <iYuri> otherwise, it is quite messy, because if I click 3 links, the page is loaded three times in the div, but later that when the link is clicked
[00:43:43] <Derppy> A quick newbie question: Using the submit function, how can I log the data that the form is about to submit to the server?
[00:45:25] <nail_> ?.serializeArray @ Derppy
[00:45:25] <bot-t> Derppy, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[00:46:36] <Derppy> nail_: Thanks.
[00:49:18] <iYuri> or how could I temporary disable jquery click() event on an object?
[00:50:53] <iksik> hello
[00:50:59] <iksik> any testswarm user around?
[01:08:37] <gnarf> iksik: whats up?
[01:09:02] <iksik> gnarf, i'm trying to make it work - but i can't find any howtos about it ;/
[01:11:01] <gnarf> iksik: i'm not sure there are any
[01:11:12] <iksik> ok i've found this post http://jasonwyatt.tumblr.com/
[01:11:16] <Asher_> hi, can anyone tell me if table elements cause issues inside body.append statements?
[01:11:16] <gnarf> iksik: whats holding you up for now?
[01:11:19] <iksik> sorry http://jasonwyatt.tumblr.com/post/1082159196/how-to-kick-off-a-testswarm-job-from-jquery
[01:11:39] <iksik> gnarf, i don't know how these suite/*.html files should look like
[01:12:10] <HardPhuck> is there a plugin that would allow me to put several 'hot spots' on the image that would have links in?
[01:12:19] <gnarf> iksik: i can tell you that the version in git is pretty much what we run on swarm.jquery.org
[01:12:27] <gnarf> we have our tests included
[01:13:36] <iksik> hm
[01:13:47] <HardPhuck> so for example i have 3 people on the image and their heads can be clicked all leading to a different url
[01:14:20] <iksik> gnarf, i'm using it right now - version from https://github.com/jquery/testswarm
[01:14:42] <Asher_> is this script calling the function cal() right? http://codepad.org/IBM5Dawu
[01:14:58] <gnarf> iksik: so you should be able to setup the database, and create a user
[01:15:01] <gnarf> get an api key
[01:15:02] <gnarf> etc
[01:15:09] <iksik> gnarf, yeah i've done it already
[01:15:36] <gnarf> so then to create a job, you send a request with the api key
[01:15:37] <iksik> testswarm works itself, but i want to launch some test 'test' to learn how to use it ;D
[01:15:55] <gnarf> you give swarm an URL to load
[01:16:12] <iksik> URL?state=addjob&user=myuser&auth=3fdsfiui8945cb4948a384d1dab68ae9e2f615a&browsers=popular&job_name=test&suites[]=foo&suites[]=bar&output=dump
[01:17:40] <gnarf> iksik: sadly, i gotta run
[01:18:03] <iksik> ok
[01:28:02] <iYuri> i'm finding some problem when I load html data into divs 2, 3 or more times
[01:28:14] <iYuri> it seems like it keeps the old data into the memory
[01:28:52] <iYuri> and the old data is shown for first..then, is shown the new data
[01:29:02] <iYuri> I use .empty() every time
[01:29:11] <iYuri> but it doesn't seems to work
[01:29:32] <iYuri> is there any trick or function
[01:29:37] <iYuri> to clean the memory?
[01:31:03] <AxonetBE> how can I disbale double submit of my form, when I click 2 times he is submitting also 2 times http://pastie.org/2734162
[01:32:31] <iYuri> disable the button till the form is submitted
[01:32:51] <intellilogic> So in HTML5 you can add JSON to data- attributes <a data-aj='{"Link":"home.php","Foo":}' and then you can asccess it via jQuery $(this).data("aj").Link but how can I get
[01:32:53] <intellilogic> errr
[01:32:59] <intellilogic> I was still typing, LOL
[01:34:14] <intellilogic> So in HTML5 you can add JSON to data- attributes <a data-aj='{"Link":"home","Foo":"Bar"}' and then you can asccess it via jQuery $(this).data("aj").Link but how can I get all of them?  I want to wrap them up for PHP  &Link=home&Foo=bar  Any ideas?  .each?
[01:34:50] <DarsVaeda> hi, does someone know for a plugin or way in pure jquery to add scroll abilities for overflow: scroll in mobile browsers? I have seen some pure javascript solutions, but would prefer jquery
[01:35:28] <intellilogic> DarsVaeda:  you mean to make it so there is always a scroll bar on the right?
[01:35:59] <intellilogic> html {overflow-y: scroll;}
[01:36:02] <intellilogic> CSS?
[01:36:16] <DarsVaeda> yes which is not supported by most mobile browsers :)
[01:36:28] <DarsVaeda> iPhone/iPad has a two finger scroll
[01:36:29] <intellilogic> ORLY?  HMmm
[01:36:34] <DarsVaeda> Android lacks it
[01:37:03] <DarsVaeda> so there are js solutions which work on mobile too, as they have js but as said I'd prefer a jquery solution
[01:37:29] <intellilogic> I see
[01:38:29] <intellilogic> Sadly, I don't know the solution, I am only slick w/ HTML5 & CSS3 :)~
[01:39:44] <iYuri> intellilogic
[01:39:54] <intellilogic> ?
[01:39:55] <iYuri> do you know a way to clear jquery memory?
[01:40:02] <intellilogic> no
[01:40:05] <iYuri> :)
[01:40:06] <iYuri> lol
[01:40:08] <intellilogic> I suck @ jQuery, LOL
[01:40:10] <iYuri> thanks the same
[01:40:26] <intellilogic> I am here for questions, but if you have HTML5 questions, fire those off - lol
[01:41:44] <intellilogic> I don't think I am going to get my tricky question answered this evening, am I?  :(
[01:41:53] <vertic4l> hi folks
[01:41:58] <intellilogic> Hi
[01:42:35] <intellilogic> HELP PLZ! <3   So in HTML5 you can add JSON to data- attributes <a data-aj='{"Link":"home","Foo":"Bar"}' and then you can asccess it via jQuery $(this).data("aj").Link but how can I get all of them?  I want to wrap them up for PHP  &Link=home&Foo=bar  Any ideas?  .each?
[01:43:40] <vertic4l> i got multiple ul li lists...   inside of those ul's are too much li's... the only way i got to change this is using jquery (js).
[01:43:41] <vertic4l> http://pastebin.com/8e6JybWB
[01:43:53] <iYuri> intellilogic: why are you using such a way to do it?
[01:43:55] <vertic4l> i wanna split those ul's
[01:44:01] <iYuri> if you already know the GET params
[01:44:09] <iYuri> you can write them into the link
[01:44:10] <iYuri> no?
[01:45:07] <flexd> Hello. I have a question about jQuery selectors. http://jsfiddle.net/mv2Jj/ I want to be able to click one every month in that ul and load a bunch of files in different divs based on that. But I can't seem to figure out how to get the parents children (if that makes sense).
[01:45:14] <vertic4l> any ideas someone why it doesnt work?
[01:45:45] <flexd> Kind of a bad idea to paste in there as I'm loading other files which wont work now.. but the selectors would be the same. D
[01:45:48] <flexd> :D*
[01:46:38] <iYuri> any question is going to be answered today :|
[01:46:49] <intellilogic> iYuri: Why am I using this method in HTML5?  I want to be able to store dynamic key value pairs, it won't always be like and foo and it's not something for the jquery to think about, the PHP will deal with that.  Write them into a link?
[01:47:35] <iYuri> <a href="page.php?Link=home6Foo=Bar" ...
[01:47:37] <iYuri> no?
[01:47:38] <Spadeski> Damn eveyrone whats up
[01:47:54] <iYuri> *<a href="page.php?Link=home&Foo=Bar" ...
[01:48:25] <Spadeski> iYuri what exactly do you want
[01:48:50] <iYuri> [10:26] <iYuri> i'm finding some problem when I load html data into divs 2, 3 or more times
[01:48:50] <iYuri> [10:26] <iYuri> it seems like it keeps the old data into the memory
[01:48:50] <iYuri> [10:27] <iYuri> and the old data is shown for first..then, is shown the new data
[01:48:50] <iYuri> [10:27] <iYuri> I use .empty() every time
[01:48:50] <iYuri> [10:27] <iYuri> but it doesn't seems to work
[01:48:50] <iYuri> [10:27] <iYuri> is there any trick or function
[01:48:53] <iYuri> [10:28] <iYuri> to clean the memory?
[01:49:19] <intellilogic> iYuri:  Ahh, because I am using them for AJAX, sometimes moving things around the page, I just want to know how to roll them up into a link, not that I always will ;)
[01:49:34] <iYuri> ah ok :P
[01:49:48] <Spadeski> intellilogic:  I can help you tere when you click a link you want it too refresh a div ?
[01:49:56] <Spadeski> like the php inside
[01:50:49] <intellilogic> Original question:  HELP PLZ! <3   So in HTML5 you can add JSON to data- attributes <a data-aj='{"Link":"home","Foo":"Bar"}' and then you can asccess it via jQuery $(this).data("aj").Link but how can I get all of them?  I want to wrap them up for PHP  &Link=home&Foo=bar  Any ideas?  .each?
[01:51:26] <Spadeski>  intellilogic  Idk about Json but in ajax you basically wanna just get the info right ?
[01:51:41] <Spadeski>  that you send through GET
[01:52:10] <intellilogic> no, I want to get the json from the html5 data on the page and manipulate the key value pairs
[01:52:21] <intellilogic> getting json from server I could have googled ;)~
[01:52:23] <Spadeski> ah yeah sorry bro havent worked with Json yet
[01:52:33] <Spadeski>  :D
[01:52:51] <intellilogic> Yea, problem is this method of HTML5 JSON in data attributes on the page is REALLY NEW
[01:52:56] <intellilogic> Also really sexy
[01:53:00] <Spadeski> lol
[01:53:16] <iYuri> ahahah
[01:53:17] <Spadeski> intellilogic: Not too sound pesty but you know anything about Jplayer or uploading files in jquery ?
[01:53:49] <intellilogic> No, not pesty, ask away, but I don't know diddle about jQuery really, so now :(   I know a lot about HTML5, LOL
[01:53:56] <nail_> intellilogic: .data('aj') will return the whole object
[01:54:01] <nail_> is that the question?
[01:54:10] <Spadeski> nah he had that
[01:54:43] <intellilogic> ORLY, how to get key and value and something like a loop putting & key = value ?
[01:55:16] <flexd> Is there any way of getting the sibling elements of the element i clicked? I have a .click event for li's in a ul, I want some attributes from the previous and next li elements.
[01:56:03] <nail_> ?.param @ intellilogic
[01:56:04] <bot-t> intellilogic, jQuery.param(obj): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[01:57:02] <Spadeski> nail_ does that send it in the adress bar or dynamically
[01:57:18] <blackspotwiggins> intellilogic, scuse me but wtf are you doing?
[01:57:48] <blackspotwiggins> you are adding custom data stuff, because its REALLY NEW and sexy, to <a>
[01:57:51] <intellilogic> ^ LOL ^
[01:57:54] <nail_> flexd: .prev() and .next()
[01:57:55] <blackspotwiggins> instead of generating a proper link in the first place
[01:58:07] <intellilogic> its not always going to be a link
[01:58:15] <blackspotwiggins> "<a data-aj='{"Link":"home","Foo":"Bar"}"
[01:58:17] <blackspotwiggins> really?
[01:58:19] <JKarsrud> then why is it an a?
[01:58:29] <nail_> Spadeski: it doesnt "send" anything, not sure what want to mean there :)
[01:58:32] <intellilogic> oh, I used that as a dummy thing, bad exable
[01:58:36] <intellilogic> pretend it's a button
[01:58:45] <blackspotwiggins> then set it as the form action
[01:58:47] <JKarsrud> doesn't make more sens
[01:58:49] <JKarsrud> sense
[01:58:49] <intellilogic> its going to read that data and decide what to do, it might just move the object around the page
[01:58:51] <blackspotwiggins> and use inputs for the keys
[01:58:59] <intellilogic> I copied something off the page with some of the attributes
[01:59:10] <Spadeski> nail_ Why ould he use that why not just do href='?var=f"
[01:59:12] <iYuri> Spadeski: any ideas about my problem?
[01:59:24] <Spadeski> iYuri No sorry not good in json
[01:59:27] <intellilogic> but that <a ...   prevents default and then loads the page via ajax, if JS not enable it does the old method of the link ;)
[01:59:30] <vertic4l> any chance to stop jquer from inserting more html than requested within this call -> $('</ul></div><div class="row"><ul class="menu_level2">').insertAfter('ul.menu_level2 li:nth-child(3n)');
[01:59:52] <vertic4l> it adds more than it should
[02:00:03] <intellilogic> I see now why everyone was confused, I should have chosen a better HTML example
[02:00:09] <nail_> Spadeski: I have no idea of the context, I was just answering the questions as they came :)
[02:00:25] <Spadeski> :D
[02:00:39] <Spadeski> nail_ Do you have any experience using Jplayer or a file uploading plugin ?
[02:01:46] <intellilogic> nail_: I am pretty sure you have me on the right track now, thanks :)
[02:03:08] <flexd> nail_: oh? I was looking at something like that but it didn't seem to work :-/
[02:06:39] <flexd> nail_: http://jsfiddle.net/mv2Jj/4/#run What object can I actually call .prev() on there?
[02:07:51] <nail_> flexd: if you want the prev/next li you clicked on, then $(this)
[02:07:55] <nail_> Spadeski: nope :/
[02:07:56] <flexd> ah
[02:08:10] <flexd> I feel silly now, I was using $(this) for something else earlier :D
[02:08:28] <vertic4l> anyone familiar with insertAfert() ?
[02:08:34] <vertic4l> insertAfter()
[02:10:28] <blackspotwiggins> vertic4l, you can add literal strings, it gets parsed. And since you have invalid html, the results might be different from what you expect
[02:10:50] <vertic4l> why do i have invalid html?
[02:10:57] <vertic4l> i just split a ul li list
[02:11:11] <vertic4l> ul li li li li li li li li </ul>
[02:11:24] <vertic4l> i just wanna insert after every 3th li an </ul><ul>
[02:11:25] <blackspotwiggins> '</ul></div><div class="row"><ul class="menu_level2">'
[02:11:29] <blackspotwiggins> how does that parse?
[02:11:29] <vertic4l> which wouldnt be invalid
[02:11:48] <vertic4l> it skips my </ul>
[02:11:53] <Spadeski> vertic4l:  Why not use a for() statement im pretty sure they have that in jquery no ?
[02:12:00] <blackspotwiggins> Spadeski, wtf?
[02:12:04] <blackspotwiggins> how is that relevant?
[02:12:31] <vertic4l> never used for(), let me have a look
[02:12:33] <Spadeski> he wants to show it every 3rd element
[02:12:35] <Spadeski> idk
[02:12:37] <Spadeski> lol
[02:12:44] <flexd> nail_: That actually returns the next/prev div. :-/
[02:12:45] <vertic4l> thought that insertAfter would do the trick
[02:12:47] <blackspotwiggins> exactly. you don't know
[02:12:56] <vertic4l> $('</ul></div><div class="row"><ul class="menu_level2">').insertAfter('ul.menu_level2 li:nth-child(3n)');
[02:12:57] <Spadeski> hey im spitballin kiss my ass
[02:13:03] <vertic4l> that was my attempt
[02:13:18] <NodeX> ?demo @ vertic4l
[02:13:18] <bot-t> vertic4l, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:13:22] <Spadeski> wtf
[02:13:40] <blackspotwiggins> like i said, you cant expect snippet starting with closing tags to work
[02:13:40] <zawopak> I'm looking for a jQuery plugin (before writing one to do this myself) which can display a series of elements in a grid-like fashion, and then randomly swap in some for others periodically, using a configurable transition effect. Does this sound like something that exists already?
[02:13:43] <blackspotwiggins> try all you want
[02:13:58] <Hornet> what format does .animate expect background position css rules in?
[02:14:08] <zawopak> e.g. you have a row of 4x4 images, and from a pool of (say) 40 or so images, it periodically swaps one of the existing 16 with another not currently being shown
[02:14:19] <Hornet> .animate({backgroundPosition:'-124 0',textIndent:900} <-- that animates the indent, not the background
[02:14:33] <blackspotwiggins> Hornet, add some units
[02:14:35] <Hornet> what I've read suggests that should wokr
[02:14:48] <Hornet> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5171080/jquery-animate-background-position
[02:14:53] <Hornet> says units break it
[02:15:20] <nail_> flexd: no it doesnt: http://jsfiddle.net/mv2Jj/5/
[02:15:47] <Hornet> also just retested, and units don't change the (non)result
[02:15:53] <flexd> nail_: I figured it out, it does within the next one (obviously)
[02:15:54] <flexd> :-)
[02:16:03] <flexd> Just have to set variables before going into the next selector
[02:16:11] <blackspotwiggins> i've had some issues with animating from one type of unit to another, might be that
[02:16:19] <blackspotwiggins> like 25% -> 300px
[02:16:33] <Hornet> it's going from 0px 0px to -124px 0px
[02:16:36] <Hornet> or should be
[02:16:39] <Asher_> Hi, on line 263 of http://codepad.org/4G9N83nF I'm getting the error: Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function.. anyone know what this might be?
[02:17:00] <blackspotwiggins> Hornet, do you have a fiddle for that?
[02:18:02] <intellilogic> nail_:  var GetParam = $(this).data("aj"); var Encoded = $.param(GetParam);   SUCCESS!!!  :)
[02:18:18] <nail_> Asher_: you have var cal = new Array();
[02:18:38] <Hornet> http://www.pogdesign.co.uk/cat/mobile/showselect blackspotwiggins
[02:18:52] <Hornet> click an unselected row, indent animates, the other doesn't
[02:19:04] <Hornet> .animate({backgroundPosition:'-124px 0px',textIndent:'900px'}
[02:19:37] <Hornet> the change in bg is a class effect, it's meant to happen after the animation
[02:19:43] <Hornet> eg that's all fine & expected
[02:20:16] <NodeX> http://www.protofunc.com/scripts/jquery/backgroundPosition/
[02:20:19] <NodeX> works there
[02:21:13] <seutje> Hornet: http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/bPej8/ what ur after?
[02:23:09] <Asher_> nail_: thanks
[02:23:15] <seutje> this kitty is making me seasick
[02:23:33] <Hornet> doesn't work for me
[02:23:37] <Hornet> latest ff
[02:25:14] <Hornet> either way the syntax is essentially the same as my live link
[02:25:18] <Hornet> which also doesn't work for me
[02:26:08] <seutje> Hornet: hmz, looks like it's set to "NaN%" in FF
[02:26:36] <Hornet> where're you seeing that?
[02:26:45] <Hornet> firebug shows no attempt to edit the settings
[02:27:11] <seutje> element.style.backgroundPositionX
[02:27:29] <frW> How come an element that I try to remove like this: $("#myId").remove() is not removed until I run the command 3 - 4 times more?
[02:27:37] <Hornet> domload
[02:27:53] <Hornet> wrap it in a document.ready
[02:28:10] <Hornet> $(function() { $("#myId").remove(); });
[02:28:43] <Hornet> seutje: so what format does firefox expect?
[02:28:47] <seutje> hmz, odd
[02:28:50] <Hornet> indeed
[02:28:52] <seutje> check the console on http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/bPej8/1/
[02:29:04] <seutje> it'll start at NaN% and then properly alternate between 0 and 100
[02:29:11] <seutje> every now and then it'll log undefined
[02:29:15] <Hornet> nice
[02:29:15] <seutje> which is just weird
[02:29:22] <clu3> if $("a#foo").html() i only get the inner HTML, is there a way to get the <a> tag as well ?
[02:29:25] <frW> Hornet, I am runnning it from a console, and the document should be ready.. :S
[02:29:30] <seutje> so I guess FF needs an explicit initial value or something
[02:29:37] <Hornet> that was a bug in ff2!
[02:29:40] <Hornet> we're on 7 now
[02:29:48] <Hornet> I'll try it though
[02:30:15] <frW> Hornet, tried it though, the element is still in the DOM
[02:30:26] <Hornet> fiddle link then
[02:31:20] <frW> Most likely works if I do it in jsfiddle.. :P
[02:32:45] <Hornet> that tells you something, then
[02:32:48] <Hornet> http://www.pogdesign.co.uk/cat/mobile/showselect seutje
[02:33:03] <Hornet> ctrl+f5
[02:33:11] <Hornet> explicit initial positions, but no dice
[02:33:16] <frW> Hornet, I don't know how to extract the parts that I am working on and putting them on jsfiddle
[02:33:28] <Hornet> then give us a live link
[02:33:51] <frW> Don't have one. Local dev-environment
[02:34:13] <seutje> that's not what I meant with an explicit initial value
[02:35:36] <frW> Hornet, Is there any other way that I can find out what is going on and why I have to call remove() three times before it's removed from the DOM?
[02:35:42] <seutje> so weird, after an iteration or 10, it'll just go to undefined o.O http://jsfiddle.net/bPej8/3/
[02:38:35] <Hornet> frW, not unless you know what's going on
[02:38:45] <Hornet> which clearly you don't otherwise you'd not be asking :)
[02:38:53] <Hornet> just put a fiddle up
[02:39:05] <Hornet> seutje: so jquery/firefox bug?
[02:39:16] <Hornet> why is it always me who finds these :\
[02:41:41] <Hornet> $('#check110 label').animate({'backgroundPosition':'-800px 0px'}); does nothing
[02:41:54] <Hornet> $('#check110 label').css('backgroundPosition','-800px 0px'); works
[02:42:01] <Hornet> so, .animate bug?
[02:42:17] <seutje> Hornet: I dunno, prolly jQuery bug, this sorta works -> http://jsfiddle.net/bPej8/4/
[02:42:53] <seutje> using percents makes it rly jerky :(
[02:43:04] <Hornet> did you just code all that?
[02:43:46] <Hornet> okay that's doing my head in
[02:43:59] <Hornet> could someone report this as a jquery bug then?
[02:45:40] <seutje> you're someone
[02:47:10] <frW> Hornet, The console in Chrome is a bit weird, worked when I added it to the source-file instead.
[02:47:11] <frW> thanks
[02:47:25] <Hornet> seutje: I am, but I have an interview to go to in 30 mins
[02:47:44] <jp23> greetings from Portugal
[02:47:46] <jp23> greetings
[02:47:51] <seutje> that... doesn't rly concern me
[02:48:10] <jp23> i've replaced a texfield with a CJuiSelectable and i want to get the value to complete the create action
[02:48:19] <jp23> can you help me?
[02:50:59] <pronoob> hello, if im calling my js scripts just before the </body> tag, is there a difference between using jquery ready function like $(myfunc()); vs just using simply myfunc(); ?
[03:05:19] <Spadeski> So hows it going you lonely riders
[03:36:36] <Joeytje50> I googled for how to know if a checkbox is checked, and I found $('input#checkboxid').is(':checked') but does that work in IE8 and lower, while they don't support the :checked selector in CSS?
[03:39:52] <Joeytje50> nevermind, someone else answered, it does work
[03:44:49] <msankhala> ?

I added a custom method for validation using addMethod() function. i am using ajax to check the unique username and script return the false is username already taken and true if available. The third parameter msg to the addMethod function showing the message either i return true of false. how to solve this issue?
[03:48:06] <msankhala> Please help me.
[03:55:42] <nospinzyb> anyone use disqus on their webpages
[03:57:04] <juha_> alekwisnia: jeditable is so 1998, you should use the super cool plugin called "yet another edit in place plugin", developed by me, the most drunkard bastard there is
[03:58:22] <Spadeski> Anyone know and worked with a good jquery uploading file plugin?
[03:59:46] <coldhead> nospinzyb: check out the disqus integration on benalman.com
[04:00:41] <juha_> disqus is pretty awesome btw
[04:00:49] <msankhala> ?
[04:01:06] <juha_> Spadeski: have you checked uploadify.com?
[04:01:15] <coldhead> i have stolen a lot from benalman.com

[04:09:37] <Spadeski> coldhead I tried that one but it just messes with my other codes
[04:09:58] <coldhead> yes, it's a piece of crap that no one would ever use
[04:09:59] <blackspotwiggins> alekwisnia, and that's not old?
[04:10:21] <Spadeski> coldhead recoomend any good and secure ones I do not feel like gettin rooted
[04:10:43] <coldhead> that and uploadify are the ones people like most lately
[04:11:14] <coldhead> but when a client asks me about file uploading i say a) it can't be done and b) it's my first day using jQuery
[04:11:25] <Spadeski> yeah i dont like either too many libraries too include
[04:11:53] <coldhead> maybe you can have the users send their files on a floppy disk?
[04:12:00] <xupisco> hi... can anyone help me? i'm using addClass... but the added class in not triggering the :hover state... is this a bug?
[04:12:02] <coldhead> that is 0 libs
[04:12:32] <juha_> file uploads in the internets?! this is madness!
[04:12:33] <coldhead> xupisco: are you doing .addClass(':hover') ?
[04:13:03] <Spadeski> I hate your guys sarcasm
[04:13:14] <juha_> coldhead: post office could install words against our savior, the lord jesus christ, on the floppy disks
[04:13:20] <xupisco> coldhead: my css have a class named abcd, and a abcd:hover
[04:13:28] <xupisco> i'm just using addClass('abcd')
[04:13:37] <coldhead> xupisco: that should work, provided you are actually hovering
[04:13:40] <msankhala> i am using jquery validation plugin for form validation. i have added a custom validation using addMethod() function to check the unique username. The php script return the true if username not already taken and return false if username already taken. The third argument of  addMethod function take the msg argument to print of the element is not valid but it is printing the msg either i return true of false from the custom validati
[04:13:45] <msankhala> how to solve this isssue
[04:13:51] <xupisco> coldhead: but is not... :(
[04:13:52] <msankhala> Please check these two links

[04:14:05] <xupisco> coldhead: i'm doing a chrome extension...
[04:14:30] <Spadeski> coldhead Its kewl jsut not a good day sprang my ankle restarted whole site bleh
[04:14:43] <juha_> xupisco: please don't tell that you're working on a browser extension and using library like jquery to build it..?
[04:14:57] <blackspotwiggins> i think he just did
[04:15:07] <xupisco> juha_: thats what i'm doing... why not?
[04:15:43] <msankhala> juha_: Any solution to my problem?
[04:15:50] <juha_> xupisco: you should use just javascript, would be lot more lightweight
[04:16:22] <juha_> msankhala: sorry, i tried reading your problem, but it was just too darn long and i got littlebit bored and then started touching myself and now i don't know what to do
[04:16:43] <coldhead> xupisco: http://jsfiddle.net/nf2SL/
[04:16:44] <msankhala> juha_: should i explain it again?
[04:16:44] <juha_> oh wait did i just say that on a public channel?
[04:16:49] <coldhead> i think you have another problem
[04:16:53] <xupisco> juha_: well, maybe... tks for the advice... jquery make it easier and faster do build! :)
[04:17:14] <coldhead> Spadeski: i think those upload plugins are a little chunky because it's hard to do otherwise
[04:17:19] <coldhead> file uploads are hard
[04:17:20] <xupisco> coldhead: hmmm... it's working
[04:17:28] <xupisco> let try again
[04:17:32] <xupisco> me*
[04:17:50] <Spadeski> clodhead I actually found one its flash but w/e
[04:18:18] <coldhead> Spadeski: if you can dump old browsers i think you can do pretty nice uploads in html5
[04:18:42] <Spadeski> coldhead example at all ?
[04:18:44] <juha_> <input type="file" multiple="multiple" /> <3
[04:19:36] <seutje> isn't that a boolean attr?
[04:20:17] <coldhead> Spadeski: http://diveintohtml5.info/table-of-contents.html
[04:20:22] <coldhead> there'll be something in there
[04:20:27] <coldhead> unless dreamhost in down
[04:20:32] <coldhead> in which case check a mirror
[04:20:42] <juha_> seutje: could be
[04:20:51] <Spadeski> ty coldhead I think I found one though :D
[04:21:10] <coldhead> Spadeski: the nice thing about the blue imp one is it uses whatever it needs, native, flash, shudderlight
[04:21:19] <coldhead> and you don't have to know anything about it
[04:21:33] <coldhead> i like not having to know things
[04:21:38] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[04:21:50] <juha_> seutje: some blogs say that you would only need multiple, i think i use multiple="multiple" on my site
[04:21:50] <seutje> heh shudderlight :')
[04:21:54] <Spadeski> coldhead Yeah but I didnt know what the .gitignore is or the .DS files
[04:22:00] <seutje> still haven't installed that on any machine I own \o/
[04:22:06] <coldhead> Spadeski: you can delete them
[04:22:18] <seutje> juha_: oh the waste
[04:22:31] <juha_> seutje: i have money to buy bandwidth!
[04:22:38] <seutje> but do your users?
[04:22:40] <coldhead> DS is some aidsy OS X crap that shouldn't be in the repo and .gitignore tells git what to ignore
[04:22:42] <Spadeski> coldhead Yeah see thats what I thought I didnt know if they were neeed or if they stored something in there
[04:22:51] <juha_> seutje: yes, my website actually makes visitors rich
[04:23:14] <seutje> juha_: "the abundance of resources is a poor excuse for crappy code"
[04:23:28] <juha_> seutje: all they need to do is deposit a small amount of money to my gaymen island bank account
[04:23:42] <coldhead> Spadeski: you should learn git anyway
[04:23:43] <seutje> for what?
[04:23:52] <coldhead> all the cool guys use it
[04:24:04] <blackspotwiggins> coldhead, not all of them
[04:24:05] <coldhead> gaymen lol
[04:24:09] <seutje> and linus
[04:24:12] <juha_> seutje: for receiving the inheritance that their uncle, the prince of zimbvave has left for them
[04:24:14] <coldhead> blackspotwiggins: yeah i don't use it either
[04:24:16] <seutje> wouldn't rly put him in the cool guys box

[05:21:58] <Hopsy> I want to check at validation using jquery..
[05:22:15] <sadmicrowave> hey all, not a lot of activity in #javascript so I'll ask here:
[05:22:17] <sadmicrowave> guys, I'm getting irritated at this, why does setting window.outerWidth change my window screenX and screenY position? Everytime I set window.outerWidth my window moves down and right by about 20px on my monitor.... how can I prevent this?
[05:22:33] <Hopsy> sadmicrowave: go ahead
[05:22:39] <Woet> sadmicrowave: a channel being dead does not magically transform your question into a jquery one.
[05:23:28] <sadmicrowave> Woet, noted
[05:24:32] <Hopsy> sadmicrowave: ask erichynds he gives fine related links for problems lol
[05:24:48] * erichynds sighs
[05:25:02] <Hopsy> :p
[05:30:49] <intellilogic> does anyone see anything wrong with this line?  It was just working, so I think I must have typo'd something and I can't seem to spot it:  var AJ_Data = $.param(RowData) +"&"+ "FormSet=" + FormName +"&"+ $.param(FromData) +"&"+  $.param(HiddenFields) +"&"+  $.param(RowFields);
[05:38:54] <intellilogic> Ok, noobie question:  var FromData = $(this).closest("form").data("aj");  works find when form has data attributes and errors when it doesn't, how to make it so that it doesn't error, but just return blank if they aren't there?  Many things like this, can I put something like On Error Resume Next?
[05:39:39] <Spabby> hi guys, I have an ul which has only 2 li items not hidden (using .hide()), I want to select them, I thought this should work: $('.fbReq-ul-unselected > li:visible').length
[05:39:52] <Spabby> but that returns 200+
[05:40:34] <Spabby> please excuse me, the act of thinking about it in a way that I could explain to others has caused me to realise I have a logic problem
[05:40:38] <Hopsy> intellilogic: that sounds soo wicked
[05:41:15] <Hopsy> you can do if($(this).closest("form") === 'undefined') { //this is when you have the errors
[05:41:23] <Hopsy> but I wouldn't preffer that
[05:41:34] <quicksilver> javascript has exceptional handling, yes
[05:41:35] <quicksilver> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Statements#try...catch_Statement
[05:41:37] <Hopsy> Can you give more info?
[05:41:45] <quicksilver> I don't know if that's the best way to handle the .data() issue or not
[05:41:51] <quicksilver> feels like there should be a cleverer way
[05:42:16] <intellilogic> :(
[05:42:25] <{-_-\\\> hi
[05:42:39] <{-_-\\\> does anybody know a good php/jquery solution for opengl?
[05:42:51] <{-_-\\\> i am developing opengl-based site viewer
[05:42:54] <intellilogic> I just want to gether if its there, if no, move on, simple, I am seeking many attributes, so if I did a bunch of if statements it might get a bit crazy
[05:43:17] <Hopsy> temp01: are you here?
[05:43:22] <{-_-\\\> so people can just enter it, type in url and website will be rendered in opengl to them
[05:43:31] <Hopsy> I want to ask you something about bot-t
[05:43:48] <Hopsy> there was a website for it, but i cant find it anymore
[05:51:58] <intellilogic> Check this...  var FromData = $(this).closest("form").data("aj"); it's self doesn't error, only when I do $.param(FromData)  I tried var FromData = $(this).closest("form").data("aj"); if(FromData==='undefined'){FromData="";};  but that still errors I am using 1.6.2, is it fixed in .4?
[05:52:21] <intellilogic> FML, im using .4 - scratch that
[06:06:11] <aaronmcadam> intellilogic: what are u trying to do
[06:11:44] <darkangel> QQ ... does jQuery cache the result of selectors, so that calling $('#game') multiple times doesn't have to search the DOM more than once?
[06:11:56] <aaronmcadam> nope
[06:12:04] <aaronmcadam> you need to cache it to a var yourself
[06:12:11] <darkangel> aaronmcadam: Okay, thanks.
[06:16:19] <{-_-\\\> darkangel: processing happens on customer's computers, so no need to bother about caching
[06:16:37] <{-_-\\\> unless they have 80386 processors
[06:17:31] <jeffsmykil> so this will only work in an iOS browser (or not work as the case may be) but I was wondering why I am always getting "0" for the touchStart function
[06:17:32] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/
[06:17:38] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/z4acm/
[06:22:56] <phlp> jeffsmykil: you need to set it to "no wrap (head)" instead of "onLoad" for the function to be found
[06:23:35] <jeffsmykil> excuse my ignorance, but how do i do that?
[06:23:56] <phlp> the top select box on jsfiddle, the one above where you select jQuery
[06:25:10] <jeffsmykil> yeah they are still touch events though
[06:25:15] <jeffsmykil> so they wont work on jsfiddle
[06:25:20] <jeffsmykil> i was just wondering why im getting 0
[06:26:11] <phlp> well i changed it to click and the function was undefined so i assumed that was your problem. what do you mean by getting 0? event.offsetX is 0?
[06:27:01] <jeffsmykil> i think it was pageX that was zero maybe
[06:27:08] <jeffsmykil> im not real sure which to use
[06:31:04] <phlp> jeffsmykil: looks like since there can be multiple touches you dont get xy from event like that http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/07/10/touching-and-gesturing-on-the-iphone
[06:31:35] <jeffsmykil> curses
[06:34:14] <jeffsmykil> this works fairly well
[06:34:15] <jeffsmykil> http://popdevelop.com/2010/08/touching-the-web/
[06:38:44] <jeffsmykil> andddd work calls
[06:43:55] <DualDetroit> Oh, oh oh YEAH HOMEBOYS!!! DUAL DETROIT BE IN DA HOUSE BREAK DOWN YO LACE WITH OUR BASS!!!!
[06:50:42] <detrate> does anyone have a good alternative to "blockui"? This seems like an older plugin that has trouble working in internet exploder
[06:51:16] <ajpiano> detrate: blockui should work fine in IE
[06:51:29] <ajpiano> and blockui is fairly regularly maintained, was last updated in may
[06:51:40] <ajpiano> make sure *you* have the most current version
[06:51:48] <detrate> alright
[06:53:17] <aaronmcadam> hey ajpiano I'm now using deferred awesomeness :D
[06:53:55] <ajpiano> nice
[06:54:48] <aaronmcadam> yeah, am I right in thinking I can cancel an ajax request with it
[06:55:26] <ajpiano> you can cancel an ajax request... without it
[06:55:34] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah
[06:55:43] <aaronmcadam> thing is
[06:56:05] <aaronmcadam> I can cancel is with deffered.reject() based on a click of button
[06:56:06] <aaronmcadam> ?
[06:56:10] <aaronmcadam> cancel it* even
[06:56:52] <aaronmcadam> I wanted to keep the logic of the button that may cancel the request separate from the ajax request itself
[06:57:10] <ajpiano> i'm not sure if doing $.ajax().reject() is the same as doing .abort()
[06:57:28] <timmywil> aaronmcadam: .abort is attached to the deferred
[06:57:33] <timmywil> call directly
[06:57:36] <aaronmcadam> ah thanks timmywil :)
[06:57:38] <erichynds> i don't think $.ajax gives you access to reject
[06:57:50] <timmywil> and yea, it's a promise, not a deferred
[06:57:55] <aaronmcadam> ohh
[06:58:00] <aaronmcadam> thank u guys!
[06:58:04] <timmywil> np
[07:04:43] <jkies00> hi all,
[07:05:23] <jkies00> i find myself writing even.preventDefault() over and over again into my functions , to prevent page jump in web apps.  is there a more efficient wa i can spread it around?
[07:06:04] <aaronmcadam> prevent page jump?
[07:06:09] <aaronmcadam> are you using hash links?
[07:06:35] <aaronmcadam> as in <a href="#">bla</a> to make action links?
[07:06:42] <jkies00> yes just hyperlinks
[07:06:53] <jkies00> with the # - exactly
[07:07:04] <aaronmcadam> you don't do that
[07:07:15] <aaronmcadam> as in <a href="javascript:void(0)">bla</a> to make action links?
[07:07:21] <aaronmcadam> that's what u do
[07:07:39] <jkies00> i don't embed any javascript in my markup
[07:07:43] <aaronmcadam> if ur link is only for a js enchanced feature
[07:07:45] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[07:08:00] <aaronmcadam> that's the best way to do it
[07:08:19] <aaronmcadam> it's *how* to do it
[07:08:20] <jkies00> well, it's a web ui.  there are lots of buttons, eveything causing different actions on the page
[07:08:33] <aaronmcadam> right cool so use that then
[07:08:46] <aaronmcadam> it's not the same as whacking onclicks everywhere
[07:10:07] <jkies00> thanks for your help :)
[07:16:09] <Michael> Is it intentional that .attr('disabled') always returns undefined on non form elements?
[07:17:46] <timmywil> Michael: it'll return undefined if the property is false or if both the attribute and property are non-existent
[07:18:17] <timmywil> Michael: i'd recommend using see prop tho
[07:18:22] <timmywil> ?prop

[07:18:24] <nycitt> I was checking out jquery's template plugin. It seemed to be a great idea, but was discontinued. Is there an accepted way of doing basic templating with jquery (if I have a say a bunch of products I want to template from a json file)
[07:18:53] <ajpiano> nycitt: pretty much any other templating lib will work with jQuery
[07:19:27] <nycitt> ajpiano: what would you recommend for very basic templating with a very easy learning curve and small footprint
[07:19:31] <ajpiano> the simple templating from undersscore.js
[07:20:03] <ajpiano> i prefer to use handlebars.js
[07:23:04] <Michael> timmywil: Both prop and attr return undefined for a non form-element even though the attribute exists
[07:23:08] <Michael> That's what I'm saying. It seems buggy
[07:23:25] <Michael> Not sure whether that attribute is valid but jQuery shouldn't care
[07:23:41] <Michael> I can do .get(0).getAttribute('disabled')
[07:23:44] <timmywil> Michael: which version of jQuery?
[07:23:58] <timmywil> that was a bug in a previous release.  and no, it's not valid
[07:24:49] <minna> how do i stop a script from running after an alert?
[07:24:52] <Michael> Lemme check
[07:25:10] <timmywil> Michael: 1.6.4 will fall back to the attribute http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/KbGdV/1/
[07:25:30] <Michael> 1.6.1
[07:25:59] <timmywil> yea, the fallback may not have been present in that release
[07:26:06] <Michael> OKay, cool. Thank you :)
[07:26:14] <timmywil> np
[07:26:14] <Michael> I'll just use get(0) unless there are more important reasons to upgrade
[07:26:57] <minna> Anyone? I pasted the script.. How do i stop any more script's from running after the alert? http://pastebin.com/qgxXx9Uq
[07:26:59] <timmywil> Michael: i always recommend upgrading.
[07:28:05] <Michael> timmywil: The last time we upgraded we hit some issues with htmlunit so it might be tricky
[07:28:11] <Michael> But if it was like security related it would be easier to justify
[07:28:24] <Michael> No biggy
[07:29:20] <ajpiano> i never understand the insane levels of wrangling some places like to put in place between upgrading 1.x.x releases
[07:29:57] <timmywil> Michael: you can see all of the bug fixes on the blog.  functionality does not change in minor point releases. http://blog.jquery.com/2011/06/30/jquery-162-released/
[07:29:57] <minna> :-s
[07:32:32] <Falcon> is it possible that jQuery truncates <script> tags in AJAX response?
[07:35:18] <timmywil> Falcon: in load, yes
[07:35:27] <Falcon> i use $.get
[07:35:35] <timmywil> then no
[07:35:42] <Falcon> or wait, do i
[07:35:45] * Falcon checks
[07:35:53] <Falcon> and why'd it truncate such in .load?
[07:36:23] <timmywil> injecting scripts generates permission denied in IE
[07:36:34] <Falcon> i see
[07:36:45] <timmywil> needs a special ajaxtransport, which getScript will use
[07:36:55] <Falcon> i really do use .load
[07:37:08] <timmywil> or you can trigger it by passing "script" as the datatype
[07:37:11] <Falcon> and i was wondering whole day why it's just not there eh
[07:37:20] <Falcon> it's not really that simple
[07:37:29] <Falcon> i use framework to produce the data
[07:37:37] <timmywil> yea, im sure you have more than just a script
[07:37:48] <Falcon> and pure html is just simplest in this specific case
[07:37:55] <Falcon> but thanks very much for answer
[07:38:07] <Falcon> i was wondering whole day why it's just not there
[07:38:48] <Slartibart> What's a good way to "retain" a reference to an element stored in this, in this case when executing the success function during an $.ajax() call? I tried creating a closure, declaring a variable outside the ajax call and storing the reference there, but Firebug says the variable isn't defined..
[07:38:54] <timmywil> Falcon: np, load is just a wrapper around $.get.  you can manipulate the data yourself instead
[07:39:24] <Michael> ajpiano: Disney is being surprisingly good about upgrading. But the last time was a major release and our qunit tests broke in htmlunit
[07:39:37] <Michael> As long as I can upgrade and get all the qunit tests to run in the terminal then we're golden
[07:39:40] <Falcon> yea i was about to use $.ajax to make sure i have as much control over thing as i can
[07:44:29] <Slartibart> Anyone understood what I meant? In my event handler the this variable refers to an html element. But when I do an $.ajax call inside the handler the success(all the ajax call result handlers) function loses that element reference, since this changes to ajax call information instead. How to get around that?
[07:46:25] <ajpiano> Slartibart: see ?ajaxcallbackscope
[07:46:26] <bot-t> Slartibart, How to deal with scope in Ajax callbacks. http://forum.jquery.com/topic/calling-object-inside-of-jquery-function#14737000000758879 Before: http://jsbin.com/iliga3/edit After: http://jsbin.com/iliga3/2/edit
[07:48:01] <SatanHimself> Satan says he wants to know if jQuery supports Internet Explorer for Windows 95 (IE 3.61 Shell Service Pack)
[07:48:54] <Slartibart> ajpiano: Perfect. Thanks!
[07:49:44] <minna> How do i stop a script from executing any more after an alert?
[07:50:40] <Slartibart> minna: A call to alert()? Just do return; or whatever is suitable to get out of your code?
[07:52:43] <minna> if i do return; i get syntax error
[07:56:26] <pentarex> hey guys can someone recommend me a php proxy script
[07:57:58] <g0rd0n> i have a problem i want to solve but am currently unable to... i have a table, and when i click on an item in a TD, i want to get the contents of the very first TD of the same TR... how can i do that?
[07:59:19] <quicksilver> $(this).closest('tr').find('td:eq(0)').text()
[08:00:13] <kborchers> g0rd0n: inside your click handler make sure that td isn't the first, if it is, you found it, if not, $(this).siblings().first();
[08:00:16] <AJTimme> hi all... simple question... if i have <div id="container"><div class="post">This is my post</div><div class="post">Second post</div></div>... how can i jquery select the .post ?
[08:00:29] <AJTimme> $("#container .post) ?
[08:01:01] <NoNoNo> AJTimme: yep
[08:01:13] <AJTimme> ok thanks!
[08:01:13] <ericincoldohio> $(this).next().next()  gets me the element i want.  It is a select box...why doesn't $(this).next('select') work?
[08:01:52] <ajpiano> ericincoldohio: .next() gets the very next sibling element and then filters it by the selector
[08:02:05] <ajpiano> it does not magically search all next elements until a match
[08:02:10] <ajpiano> you need see ?nextall
[08:02:11] <bot-t> .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[08:02:17] <ericincoldohio> so got to parent ?
[08:02:57] <iande> see ?siblings
[08:02:58] <bot-t> .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[08:05:47] <ericincoldohio> so next() is always referring to the very next sibling...the filer is just being ran on the next sibling?
[08:05:58] <ajpiano> yes
[08:06:12] <ajpiano> use .nextAll("select").first()
[08:06:34] <ericincoldohio> thanks, got it to work, I just keep screwing up next()...makes sense now
[08:07:46] <AJTimme> anyone familiar with the carouFredSel ?
[08:09:25] <sphinxxx> any jsonp masters here
[08:10:05] <g0rd0n> kborchers: thanks, eventually i managed with $(this).closest('tr').children('td:first').text();
[08:11:53] <muszek> hi
[08:11:54] <muszek> are you guys aware that stylesheets are messed up @ jquery ui website?
[08:12:17] <ajpiano> muszek: are you aware that jqueryui.it is not the jqueryui website
[08:12:29] <Michael> OH BURRRRRN
[08:12:32] <muszek> oh
[08:13:18] <muszek> how come it's 1st in google for many queries? "jquery ui autocomplete" being one of them...
[08:13:50] <ajpiano> cause they are black hat SEO spammers
[08:13:54] <ajpiano> who used to have jquery.it
[08:13:59] <ajpiano> but we were able to shut that down
[08:14:06] <acidChrist> Hello all
[08:14:13] <acidChrist> I have problem with browser back button. Problem exists for IE and google chrome. I'm creating autoload mechanism for search engine. Mechanism works like google search.
[08:14:17] <muszek> sorry to hear that
[08:14:27] <acidChrist> If i have builded results and redirect to another page and back to the page with results, results desapear. I tried a lot solutions described by developers like hashing, history.js and many more but every one is not working.
[08:14:46] <acidChrist> anyone has any idea?
[08:15:01] <quicksilver> ajpiano: but they don't appear to run ads or anything, what's the point?
[08:15:16] <ajpiano> i'm not sure
[08:15:19] <ajpiano> the jquery.it site ran ads
[08:15:41] <ericincoldohio> didn't used to try to sell jquery for money>?
[08:15:56] <ajpiano> no lol
[08:15:58] <quicksilver> now it just seems to be a broken mirror of the jquery ui pages
[08:16:51] <ericincoldohio> thought it was..there used to be an open source system where a one off url would try to sell it
[08:17:16] <ericincoldohio> at least they were reasonable priced...
[08:19:08] <techouse> how do i make an icon popup the datepicker? currently i'm using a dirty hack like this: <input type="hidden" id="my-calendar" /> with a combo of a jquery-ui datepicer icon-trigger. that kinda works, but all i want is the datepicker to simply show what date it is and not enable me the option of picking a date and returning it into an input form
[08:19:12] <techouse> how to do that?
[08:20:37] <techouse> simply said, all i want is to click on an image which in turn pops up the jquery datepicker as a simple calendar
[08:28:20] <juha_> http://worrydream.com/Tangle/
[08:31:30] <g0rd0n> when i click on a td, i want to get the value of the hidden <input inside of that td (there are no other inputs). what can i do? i tried stuff like closest but it doesnt work, i guess it looks in the other direction
[08:32:48] <quicksilver> g0rd0n: $(this).find('input[type=hidden]').val()
[08:32:51] <nail_> g0rd0n: $(this).find(':hidden').val()
[08:32:56] <nail_> ah
[08:32:56] <g0rd0n> yeah i just found about find
[08:32:58] <g0rd0n> damn  :)
[08:34:11] <NET||abu1e> Hi guys, i'm rendering a jquery tmpl tempalte, and data in inserting is in decimal form, i need to chop off the .00 at the end (it's a price)
[08:34:15] <NET||abu1e> how can i format the string?
[08:34:31] <NET||abu1e> or how do i parseInt() from inside the template?
[08:38:04] <n8o-mba> if I want to completely obliterate an element, is .remove() sufficient?
[08:40:00] <JSM87> Hi guys, using the jquery cycle plugin. Is it possible to change the step e.g instead of rotating 1 at a time, 3 at a time as I have 21 images altogether....
[08:40:06] <JSM87> e.g step:3
[08:43:25] <muszek> jquery ui autocomplete question: I have a local source for the autocomplete widget which looks like this: http://k.bobek.muszek.com:37080/js/autocomplete_data.js .  Normally if I named a property "value", then it would be used to generate the list of elements to select from.  But I'd like to have two autocomplete inputs: "latin name" and "polish name".  When user uses either input and chooses some element, the other input is filled with a corresponding valu
[08:43:25] <muszek> e (also, "g" property is used to fill another field, but that's not important here).  How can I achieve it without creating two separate arrays (one for polish and 2nd for latin input), which would be unelegantly redundant?
[08:45:34] <muszek> Another idea is to generate those two arrays on the fly, after the page is loaded... not sure how taxing would it be on the user's cpu - there will be a few hundred elements
[08:47:05] <muszek> so in brief, the question is: can I specify which property is used to build the list of elements?
[08:51:56] <techouse> how do i hide the left and right buttons in the datepicker?
[08:55:58] <brettfrable> Hey guys
[08:56:06] <brettfrable> I need a little help
[08:56:28] <brettfrable> client asked that I use jFlow for the slider in the header on this page
[08:56:29] <brettfrable> http://midatlantictimberframes.com.s109594.gridserver.com/
[08:56:37] <brettfrable> but they want the slider to continuously slide right
[08:56:40] <brettfrable> instead of resetting
[08:57:26] <brettfrable> heres the javascript
[08:57:26] <brettfrable> http://www.pastie.org/2736026
[08:59:10] <joe2> Hi there. I'm trying a fairly simple log of $('#element').css('property') -- I want to see what the property is set to. The element is actually created by the same function in the script  (by an append()). I wondered if there were any guidelines about getting info on things injected by the script itself? (I'm aware of bind(), but I'm guessing something like that wouldn't apply in this case.) Cheers!
[09:04:37] <n8o-mba> joe2: you have to do it programatically?
[09:04:59] <n8o-mba> so I'm creating an element, adding a bind() event handler, and adding it to the dom
[09:05:50] <n8o-mba> if I trigger scroll (the event) by using a reference I saved to the element, it works. if I select the element anew and then trigger it, it doesn't work
[09:05:51] <n8o-mba> thoughts?
[09:06:33] <miceiken> so, is this a good idea? I have this user profile site, and when the users are gonna change it, i want to have a sort of checkbox that turns the paragrahs into input boxes
[09:06:40] <FearOfMusic> if you have ~100 divs you want to fade in and out at once is there a quicker method (less cpu intensive) than just tell each one individually to fade in/out?
[09:07:50] <miceiken> FearOfMusic are you talking to me?
[09:08:05] <FearOfMusic> im just asking a question
[09:08:29] <joe2> n8o-mba: I'm not sure what you're getting at, sorry. Are you asking me a fresh/slightly different question to the one I asked? :-)
[09:08:42] <Whirl3d> FearOfMusic, wrap them in a div and fade it out
[09:09:15] <n8o-mba> joe2: you want to "get info". you could use webkit's inspector, so I was asking, do you have to do it programatically? as in, what are you trying to do?
[09:10:51] <ChaosExAnima> Anyone ever have issues with the callback function for a $.post simply not firing?
[09:11:09] <aaronmcadam> can anyone remember the name of that jquery plugin for enhancing forms that was released a few months back
[09:11:10] <joe2> n8o-mba: Ah, apologies, yes. Probably best if I create a quick jsfiddle, I'll link in a moment.
[09:11:14] <aaronmcadam> it got loads of attention
[09:12:42] <ajpiano> FearOfMusic you can also try rule-based animation
[09:12:45] <ajpiano> http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/11/jqueryrule.html
[09:12:58] <FearOfMusic> Whirl3d: would moving items around in the DOM be quicker? basically i have 3 'groups' of divs, one group doesnt change, one group needs to fade out and one group needs to fade in
[09:13:20] <Hooky> hello
[09:13:25] <FearOfMusic> ajpiano: ill look at that thank you
[09:13:39] <Aristata> Is there a way to check if an iframe currently has a scroll bar?
[09:15:28] <Hooky> hello, im trying to fade in images after they have loaded using .load, but they are intermittent in IE, any tips?
[09:16:11] <n8o-mba> FearOfMusic: give each group a shared parent, fade that
[09:16:17] <Whirl3d> FearOfMusic, you could use .wrap and .unwrap I don't know how fast they are, but it should work
[09:16:35] <Whirl3d> Yeah, what n8o-mba said.
[09:16:57] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, I couldn't get .rules to work from the link you provided.
[09:17:35] <ajpiano> yeah, seems like some of the demos are busted
[09:17:36] <ajpiano> but some work
[09:17:40] <ajpiano> http://flesler.webs.com/jQuery.Rule/
[09:17:42] <Whirl3d> nvm, the demo instructions didn't make sense.
[09:17:54] <Whirl3d> When he says click on them, he meant the rules, not the content. LOL
[09:18:12] <mikedoty> Hello distinguished countrypeople.
[09:18:23] <mikedoty> There is a function called fadeOut()
[09:18:38] <Whirl3d> mikedoty, thank you
[09:18:44] <mikedoty> Is there a similar one where I can fade it partway, but not all the way?  WHere I can supply a parameter that determines how far it fades?
[09:18:54] <Whirl3d> mikedoty, fadeTo
[09:19:15] <mikedoty> Oh cool... sorry I should have looked it up, I didn't believe it existed though
[09:19:23] <mikedoty> The road to distinguishment is long and slow
[09:19:28] <mikedoty> Thanksn for helping
[09:19:30] <Whirl3d> You might just want to use .animate though
[09:19:34] <mikedoty> Oh?
[09:19:42] <mikedoty> I'll look into it...
[09:19:46] <Whirl3d> there are still some bugs with fadeIn and fadeOut...not sure about fadeTo
[09:20:30] <mikedoty> Ok I see, yeah I could just give the opacity I want to animate... that looks pretty clean
[09:20:33] <mikedoty> THanks again ;)
[09:21:33] <Whirl3d> np (feeling fully extinguished  8)
[09:24:52] <gizmore> i want to get my popup div. if it is not there, i want to create an empty div with id=popup and return it then
[09:25:20] <gizmore> trying ('#page').add('<div id="popup"></div>') ... should this work?
[09:27:13] <gizmore> ahhh ... it's $.append :] nvm
[09:28:35] <Hooky> 	
[09:28:35] <Hooky> 	
[09:28:35] <Hooky> 	 $(".thumbover").hide().not(function() {

[09:28:35] <Hooky> images sometimes dont appear in IE using this, works in every other browser fine?
[09:29:48] <NackNick> can someone take a look at my code, for some reason none of my divs are showing. http://pastebin.com/MVSRQDX4
[09:30:03] <Whirl3d> hooky, try using animate rather than fadeIn....there are some bugs with fadeIn
[09:30:12] <Aristata1> Is there a way to check if an iframe currently has a scroll bar?
[09:32:42] <NackNick> ?
[09:32:58] <JSM87> Hi guys, using the jquery cycle plugin. Is it possible to change the step e.g instead of rotating 1 at a time, 3 at a time as I have 21 images altogether...
[09:34:32] <Hooky> Whirl3d, Im trying to animate the opacity but I get the same results, some of the images do what their told and the others dont appear at all, the ones that work fine are smaller in file size?
[09:35:06] <Whirl3d> There is a bug with IE and caching images that don't fire load.
[09:35:48] <Whirl3d> Try using a handler to determine if the image is cached before setting up your load handler. If the image is cached, it never fires .load in IE
[09:36:00] <xavier_d> jquery-ui autocomplete question: how do I set the filter function (or change the default param) so it searches on a different json attribute than label of value?
[09:36:17] <pashmi56> hello, im new to jquery, trying to declare my function to have also call back like: http://pastebin.com/Fp5Fx30K ... any guidance please?
[09:36:32] <Hooky> I cleared the cache and the same thing happens regardless
[09:36:59] <xavier_d> I could find doc how how to set the display of each line, but not how to say how to search the json object I got
[09:37:30] <Whirl3d> Hooky, try appending something like this:   .each(function () {if ($(this).width()) {fadeIn(300)'}});
[09:38:23] <Whirl3d> Hooky, I may have the wrong number of }) but it should work. If the image is small and loads quickly, checking for it's width property will allow you to manually trigger the fadeIn on load in IE
[09:44:05] <joe2> n8o-mba: Thanks for the help; I had to move on to something else for the moment. Hopefully pop back in sometime soon.
[09:44:10] <joe2> Bye for now..
[09:45:33] <zmbmartin> are duplicate ids bad?
[09:45:41] <miceiken> obviously
[09:45:47] <miceiken> ids are supposed to be unique
[09:46:45] <gizmore> Hooky: maybe the images are not loaded then?
[09:47:02] <zmbmartin> miceiken: how do I handle a case where I need to $('id').live('blur'.... with a lot of fields?
[09:47:41] <cody--> how can i get the max value of a windows scroll bar?
[09:48:41] <armicron> zmbmartin, do you know about classes?
[09:49:23] <armicron>  $('.class').live('blur'
[09:51:43] <Hooky> Whirl3d, sorry, its I dont understand why its working sometimes but not others
[09:52:06] <zmbmartin> armicron: ok yeah I get it now. thanks
[09:52:27] <Hooky> i meant gizmore
[09:53:21] <gizmore> Hooky: did you make sure the images are loaded when you display them?
[09:54:08] <Hooky> i thought thats what .load determined?
[09:54:19] <Hooky> and then fired once they are loaded?
[09:54:50] <gizmore> Hooky: hmm yeah
[09:55:19] <Hooky> can you take a look at my page? its very rough at the moment but it might help you understand
[09:55:31] <gizmore> Hooky: maybe you should split your one statement into two ... no didn't look yet ... give me the link again :)
[09:55:36] <Whirl3d> $(".thumbover").hide().load(function () {$(this).fadeIn(3000);}).attr('src',someurl).each(function () {if ($(this).complete) {$(this).unbind('load').fadeIn(3000);});
[09:55:59] <Hooky> http://andy-hook.co.uk/testpage.html
[09:56:10] <cody--> how can i tell if a div is scrolled to the bottom if i have a max-height set on the div?
[09:56:12] <Hooky> im using 2 images per thumb to fade
[09:56:39] <gizmore> Hooky: Whirl3d did just post the way you should do it ... first assign the load to the elements :)
[09:56:40] <zmbmartin> anyone that can give me some pointers with this --> https://gist.github.com/1304309? Each section has anywhere from 10 to 100 fields and this is eating up the cpu?
[09:57:23] <Whirl3d> Hooky, that is how I have done it in the past.
[09:58:00] <Whirl3d> I think I messed up the if ($(this).complete)...in fact I am sure of it.
[09:58:15] <cody--> how can i tell if a div is scrolled to the bottom if i have a max-height set on the div?
[09:58:16] <Whirl3d> it needs to read: if $(this)[0].complete
[09:59:07] <Hooky> ive been using the thumbover class for all the thumbnails
[09:59:23] <Hooky> how can I set the attr('src',someurl)?
[10:01:08] <Whirl3d> Hooky, you could use a big associative array at the beginning of your script that said, var urls={flipprint:'img/thumb/flipprint.jpg', nextimage:'someurl'} and then apply them using .each
[10:03:05] <Whirl3d> $(".thumbover").each(function () {$(this).load(function() {$(this).fadeIn(3000);}).attr("src",urls[$(this).attr('id')]);if ($(this)[0].complete) {$(this).fadeIn(3000);}});
[10:03:31] <kibab> Before I write the code, anybody know a good way to identify some node n1 that comes before node n2 in the dom even if n1 is a descendant of any of n2's ancestors? closest() doesn't seem to look at a parent's descendants.
[10:04:14] <Whirl3d> closest only lookups up the heirarchy. find looks down the heirarchy
[10:04:30] <Whirl3d> siblings() checks on the same level
[10:05:40] <kibab> Whirl3d: Yeah, I was thinking I was going to need need to use some combination of prevAll(), parents(), and find()
[10:06:38] <Whirl3d> Hooky, or you could employ a naming strategy whereby the id of your element is the base of your filename in the url and ".jpg" for the main image, or "-thumb.jpg" for the thumbs, then you don't need the array.
[10:08:10] <Hooky> Whirl3d, how would I go about this in the code? im sorry im using this as my project to learn more and having a hard time.
[10:08:42] <Whirl3d> var loadShow=function () {$(this).fadeIn(3000);}; $(".thumbOver").load(loadShow).attr('src',function () {return ($(this).attr('id')+"-thumb.jpg")}).each(function () {if ($(this)[0].complete) {loadShow()});
[10:10:18] <Whirl3d> I just used the loadShow function reference to cleanup the code. You could substitute, fadeIn...it just looks cleaner to me
[10:12:59] <Whirl3d> var loadShow=function () {if ($(this)[0].complete) {$(this).fadeIn(3000);});}; var getThumburl=function () {return ($(this).attr('id')+"-thumb.jpg");}; $(".thumbOver").load(loadShow).attr('src', getThumburl).each(loadShow);
[10:14:34] <tash> if I have an img with class="thumb" ... shouldn't this work? http://pastie.org/2736393 and write the id of the image to the console?
[10:14:48] <Hooky> thank you for your help!
[10:20:02] <chilversc> tash: indeed it should
[10:20:58] <chilversc> tash: although, you arn't waiting until document ready there, so its probably running before the DOM has been fully loaded
[10:22:22] <Whirl3d> Hooky, great lookin' portfolio, btw.
[10:23:17] <tash> yeah, I think you are right ... firebug says nod defined on page load
[10:23:39] <r4nd0m-> hello I'm having a slight issue doing something trivial. I have an html input id #search_box w/ value="enter name here". I have in jquery $('#search_box').click(function(){ $('#search_box').val(""); }); but it isn't working
[10:23:42] <tash> $ is not defined is what I get
[10:23:43] <r4nd0m-> please advise
[10:24:08] <Whirl3d> r4nd0m-, try .focus instead of .click
[10:24:12] <r4nd0m-> ok
[10:24:44] <r4nd0m-> $('#search_box').focus(function(){ $('#search_box').val(""); });
[10:24:55] <r4nd0m-> http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[10:24:56] <r4nd0m-> hmm.
[10:25:15] <Whirl3d> $("#search_box").focus(function () {$(this).val("");});
[10:25:30] <r4nd0m-> yup
[10:25:44] <r4nd0m-> you this in side $
[10:25:45] <r4nd0m-> ok
[10:25:56] <r4nd0m-> i didn't know this before
[10:26:02] <r4nd0m-> this is nice
[10:26:25] <r4nd0m-> it's not working
[10:26:56] <r4nd0m-> <input id="search_box" type="text" name="search" value="Enter your name here"/>
[10:27:07] <r4nd0m-> $('#search_box').focus(function(){ $(this).val(""); });
[10:27:13] <r4nd0m-> I don't know what I'm doing wrong
[10:27:21] <Whirl3d> Are you making sure to do it on dom load
[10:27:27] <ibike365> having an issue in FF where setting focus on a text input does not put the cursor in the textbox. anyone know a fix for this?
[10:27:38] <r4nd0m-> no
[10:27:55] <Whirl3d> $(document).ready(function () {$("#search_box").focus(function (){$(this).val("");});});
[10:28:11] <r4nd0m-> uhuh
[10:28:30] <r4nd0m-> ok
[10:28:32] <r4nd0m-> that' wasn't the issue
[10:28:38] <r4nd0m-> I had it inside wrong tags
[10:28:54] <JeroenDeDauw> I have a td ( table cell ) with click event in which I want the browser to navigate to a new location, either in the current tab or in a new one, depending on click vs control click. Is there any nice way to do this?
[10:28:54] <JeroenDeDauw> I know you can see if ctrl was held in the event args, but am looking for something nicer then creating a link with or without target=_blank attr and triggering click on that.
[10:28:55] <r4nd0m-> I was using <script src=tojquery>stuff here</script>
[10:29:25] <r4nd0m-> I changed it to <src src=jquery></script> <script type=text/javascript>jquery stuff here </script>
[10:29:34] <r4nd0m-> inside fresh script tags it seems to work
[10:29:44] <r4nd0m-> but I till use it now in document ready
[10:29:51] <r4nd0m-> just read that one on docs, thanks man
[10:29:56] <Whirl3d> np
[10:30:39] <JAAulde> morning, jQuerians
[10:30:54] <Whirl3d> JeroenDeDauw, you could manually trigger an anchor element somewhere that would do the same thing but would remain hidden.
[10:31:35] <Whirl3d> JAAulde, good morning
[10:31:52] <JeroenDeDauw> Whirl3d: I actually have an anchor element in the td, but if I trigger click on that, it also gets captured by the click handler on the td and I end up with an infinite loop
[10:32:07] <JeroenDeDauw> Seems silly to go create an extra <a>
[10:32:09] <Whirl3d> e.preventDefault();
[10:32:23] <Whirl3d> stop propagation of the click event
[10:32:41] <Whirl3d> don't handle the click event on the TD element, just use the anchor element.
[10:32:51] <aaronmcadam> Haha! I just got Rick-Rolled by JS! http://www.p01.org/releases/140bytes_music_softSynth/
[10:33:10] <Whirl3d> then check to see if the control key is down when clicked and change the "target" attribute of the anchor element
[10:35:37] <Fernandos> hi
[10:36:27] <JAAulde> Hi Fernandos
[10:36:32] <ibike365> hi Fernandos
[10:36:40] <Fernandos> :)
[10:36:42] <ibike365> and everyone else too :)
[10:37:00] * Whirl3d instigates a group hug
[10:37:18] * aaronmcadam would like to opt out
[10:37:21] <Fernandos> Can I trigger a .hide() when a button is pressed that was added to the dom? maybe via live() ?
[10:37:40] <aaronmcadam> ?delegate @ Fernandos
[10:37:40] <bot-t1> Fernandos, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[10:39:13] <Fernandos> hmm I'm not sure but I guess it can be done easier than with delegate..
[10:39:25] <Fernandos> I tried this without success $('.dom_button).click(function() {    $(this).parent().parent(".pop_box").fadeOut("fast");	});
[10:39:53] <JAAulde> Fernandos: there are too many ifs/butts involved here--make a fiddle of what you want
[10:40:52] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ Fernandos
[10:40:53] <bot-t1> Fernandos, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[10:41:17] <bot-t1> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[10:41:33] <aaronmcadam> good bot-t1
[10:42:53] * JAAulde pats bot-t1 on hims widdle head
[10:48:24] <ibike365> I've got a bug only in FF where setting focus on a text input does not place cursor in input, even though focus is set.
[10:48:31] <ibike365> anyone know a fix for this?
[10:48:39] <Matt_JQ> fix what?
[10:49:01] <ibike365> setting focus on input does not put cursor in that input - only in FF
[10:49:14] <Matt_JQ> oh, no, not sure
[10:50:05] <ibike365> interestingly, on load this works, but when I use run, it doesn't http://jsfiddle.net/ibike365/zMxtr/2/
[10:50:23] <Matt_JQ> when is event.preventDefault(); suppose to be user in a $('form').submit(function{ })
[10:50:43] <Matt_JQ> *user - used
[10:51:18] <aaronmcadam> Matt_JQ: what do u mean?
[10:51:37] <aaronmcadam> if you want to do somethin other than the default action, you need to prevent it
[10:51:40] <gizmore> what events do i need to bind for mousedown, mouseup, mousemove?
[10:51:58] <aaronmcadam> you've answered your own question gizmre
[10:52:06] <Matt_JQ> because its not working for me, check this http://jsfiddle.net/FPeLY/
[10:52:30] <aaronmcadam> would help if ur fiddle actually was set up
[10:52:42] <gizmore> aaronmcadam: thank you
[10:52:47] <aaronmcadam> why are u preventing default in your callback?
[10:53:06] <Matt_JQ> no, IDK where it goes
[10:53:25] <Matt_JQ> nvm I got it, the method in my form wasn't set to POST
[10:53:25] <aaronmcadam> Matt_JQ: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/FPeLY/1/
[10:53:56] <Matt_JQ> so the page was "refreshing" with a "?"
[10:54:07] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[10:54:46] <Matt_JQ> but it still doesn't alert data
[10:54:51] <context> any arel guru's here? if i do tbl[:field].eq(10).to_sql it properly wraps everything, but how do i get the 'quoted'/wrapped for just tbl[:field]
[10:55:19] <Matt_JQ> http://jsfiddle.net/FPeLY/2/
[10:55:56] <aaronmcadam> Matt_JQ: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/FPeLY/3/
[10:56:46] <context> oops wrong room
[10:57:08] <aaronmcadam> Also, Matt_JQ have u heard of the serialize function see ?serialize
[10:57:09] <bot-t1> Also, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[10:57:41] <Matt_JQ> no I haven't
[10:57:55] <ibike365> ?delegate
[10:57:55] <bot-t1> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[10:58:02] <aaronmcadam> Matt_JQ: Look: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/FPeLY/5/
[10:58:13] <aaronmcadam> no need to create vars
[10:59:05] <aaronmcadam> also, use firebug for debugging instead of alert, you'll thank yourself later heh
[10:59:11] <phishy> anyone know if there is a way to disable javascript from the browser console? $ = null is fun.. but i was wondering if there are more options.. answers for any browser will do. ;-)
[10:59:20] <aaronmcadam> huH?
[10:59:34] <aaronmcadam> u mean disable jQuery?
[10:59:46] <phishy> i know how to disable jquery. $=null ;-)
[10:59:56] <aaronmcadam> otherwise u can turn js off from the browser's preferences
[11:00:05] <phishy> was wondering if there are ways to temporarily suspend javascript completely wi/o navigating to preferences
[11:00:20] <phishy> from the console perhaps
[11:00:22] <aaronmcadam> turn js off by using js
[11:00:23] <aaronmcadam> lol
[11:00:35] <phishy> oh yeah, i guess that does sounds silly
[11:00:45] <aaronmcadam> but valid question
[11:00:51] <aaronmcadam> maybe firebug should have that
[11:00:53] <aaronmcadam> heh
[11:01:21] <aaronmcadam> but the cross-browser console implementations wouldn't work probably
[11:02:42] <aaronmcadam> phishy: are u trying to test ur enhancements?
[11:03:17] <aaronmcadam> phishy: you can turn off js with the web developer toolbar u know
[11:03:18] <phishy> aaronmcadam: i was testing to see that if i disabled js, validation still occurs server side correctly
[11:03:26] <phishy> bligity blah
[11:03:27] <aaronmcadam> ah good man
[11:04:03] <aaronmcadam> pity the chrome version doesn't have a Disable button :s
[11:07:14] <dangerousdave> Not the best with jquery, can someone suggest a general approach for what i am trying to achieve please? I have a grid of photos, and when they are clicked on, an opaque overlay is animated on top of the entire picture that contains some dynamically set text. I have the images, and on the onclick handler working, just trying to figure out the best way to apply the overlay. thanks
[11:07:30] <iksik_> is it possible to get (for example) a div html but with div itself included?
[11:10:14] <adrianp> iksik_: '<div>' + $('div').html() + '</div>';
[11:10:23] <iksik_> ....
[11:10:28] <iksik_> very funny :D
[11:10:51] <adrianp> re-read your question
[11:10:55] <adrianp> and see if it matches my answer
[11:11:30] <ajpiano> ?g jquery outerhtml yelotofu @ iksik_
[11:11:32] <bot-t1> iksik_, jQuery: outerHTML | Yelotofu - http://www.yelotofu.com/2008/08/jquery-outerhtml/
[11:11:47] <Zerxer> I have to agree that was a funny answer
[11:12:02] <Zerxer> weird I thought jquery had a built-in outerHTML, guess not
[11:12:31] <iksik_> ajpiano, thank You
[11:17:10] <shesek> iksik_, you can use the native outerHTML when it exists (IE-only, I think) or $(document.createElement('div')).append(element.clone()).html() when it doesn't
[11:21:02] <trose> i want to use $.post() but make it spawn a new tab or window in the browser... is that possible?
[11:22:34] <aaronmcadam> you'd trigger popup blocking trose
[11:23:02] <trose> aaronmcadam, even in just a new tab?
[11:23:10] <aaronmcadam> it's the same thing
[11:23:19] <aaronmcadam> there's no "tab.open"
[11:23:20] <aaronmcadam> lol
[11:24:09] <trose> i'm trying to give the user the ability to download a text version of the current page by sending a request to the server and then have the server push an attachment header
[11:24:14] <aaronmcadam> your user would have to click the "allow popup blocking?" dialog of the browser
[11:24:31] <trose> but i want to keep the current page as well
[11:24:32] <aaronmcadam> disable i mean
[11:24:56] <aaronmcadam> you mean content-disposition?
[11:25:01] <trose> yeah
[11:25:19] <aaronmcadam> right and have u tried doing it just on the same page
[11:25:42] <trose> it says i can't write the header after i've already done so
[11:26:07] <aaronmcadam> ah
[11:26:07] <trose> Error: Can't set headers after they are sent.
[11:26:11] <trose> :/
[11:26:13] <aaronmcadam> php?
[11:27:00] <aaronmcadam> can't u set the header in ur view?
[11:27:05] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[11:28:27] <trose> aaronmcadam, is there a way to write the header so that i can change it later?
[11:29:40] <Hopsy> Is there a xml validator for jquery?
[11:32:41] <aaronmcadam> trose what's ur server side lang?
[11:33:03] <trose> node.js running express and socket.io
[11:33:05] <aaronmcadam> Hopsy: what exactly do u mean
[11:33:09] <aaronmcadam> oh nice
[11:33:21] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[11:33:44] <aaronmcadam> I'm wondering if u could spawn a process that creates ur attachment
[11:34:04] <Hopsy> aaronmcadam: this is exactly what i mean: http://www.w3schools.com/XML/xml_validator.asp
[11:34:04] <aaronmcadam> I've not properly played with node yet tho so feel free to correct me
[11:34:12] <aaronmcadam> why would u want jquery to do that?
[11:34:17] <aaronmcadam> and w3fools :P
[11:35:01] <Hopsy> is there anyone else who can help me?
[11:35:05] <aaronmcadam> Hopsy: what is ur app doing?
[11:35:15] <gpk> i want to return a jquery arrayLike from a function in a variable ... var foo = function() {return $(this)}
[11:35:24] <aaronmcadam> maybe you could query a web service to do it Hopsy
[11:35:36] <aaronmcadam> does the w3c validator have an api?
[11:35:43] <gpk> console.log(foo) returns an object not a jquery object
[11:35:48] <Hopsy> it is a testsuite
[11:35:58] <aaronmcadam> of course it does gpk that's that $() is
[11:36:03] <gpk> console.log($(foo)) isnt helping
[11:36:04] <aaronmcadam> right Hopsy, cool
[11:36:11] <trose> aaronmcadam, the express server will do what i want except i think if i use jquery.post on the client it will just load the new page in the current window
[11:36:14] <aaronmcadam> I'm thinkin you'll need a service maybe
[11:36:29] <gpk> is it possible to return a jquery object
[11:36:48] <aaronmcadam> that's what u *are* doing already gpk
[11:37:03] <gpk> i want to use foo.remove()
[11:38:09] <aaronmcadam> wha?
[11:38:30] <aaronmcadam> gpk can u make a jsfiddle with an idea of what u want?
[11:38:30] <gpk> im not getting back a jquery object im getting the dom object, i want to return a jquery object so i can foo.remove
[11:38:30] <gehsekky> when writing a jquery plugin, if i do a "return this.each" and inside that, bind an event to each element, does the plugin return the elements with the appended events?
[11:38:53] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/FuS8y/
[11:38:57] <andrew9183> anyone know why this won't work ?
[11:39:13] <aaronmcadam> that's weird, u should be getting the jQuery set
[11:39:39] <aaronmcadam> can u put what u have so far on jsfiddle please gpk? sounds strange
[11:40:01] <aaronmcadam> trose, jump onto #Node.js
[11:40:02] <andrew9183> should be pretty simple, isnt it ?
[11:40:10] <ajpiano> andrew9183: you need the jQuery color plugin to do color animations
[11:40:18] <ajpiano> ?g jquery color
[11:40:19] <bot-t1> ajpiano, Color Animations | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[11:40:31] <aaronmcadam> nice
[11:40:31] <ajpiano> gehsekky: it returns the elements, same as always
[11:40:34] <aaronmcadam> has 2.0 come out yet
[11:40:42] <ajpiano> and yes, the events are attached to those elements
[11:40:49] <gehsekky> ok that's what i thought
[11:41:01] <andrew9183> ah i see, thanks ajpiano
[11:41:06] <ajpiano> no aaronmcadam
[11:41:10] <aaronmcadam> http://jqueryboilerplate.com/ baby
[11:41:55] <aaronmcadam> and some idiot made this https://github.com/ajpiano/boilerplate-boilerplate ;)
[11:43:32] <NiX_> hey thanks for all the help the past couple of days
[11:43:42] <NiX_> http://www.dontsnooze.com/amos/help/avsForm2.php  <-- finished jquery/ajax demo
[11:43:44] <aaronmcadam> no prob NiX_ ;)
[11:43:45] <aaronmcadam> haa
[11:43:58] <NiX_> well i can probably simplify more but it works so im really happy
[11:44:12] <NiX_> lol aaronmcadam
[11:44:22] <aaronmcadam> The power of ajax eh? :D
[11:44:41] <aaronmcadam> this is more power-er-er danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/
[11:46:19] <NiX_> i learned so much , the functions were so long, now i have it down to 3 small functions running the whole thing
[11:47:13] <NiX_> ok lol at the first lazy pic
[11:47:20] <NiX_> the line around the fallen tree is hilarious
[11:48:20] <NiX_> this page is cool tho =)
[11:48:40] <NiX_> one of my main problems tho with ajax, was getting it to work with IE
[11:48:56] <NiX_> you google, theres a million "fixes" but none of them work
[11:49:05] <NiX_> then days later u find one that works
[11:49:17] <aaronmcadam> haha I love the callbacks one
[11:49:19] <NiX_> i hate ie, but since its used so much, things could be documented better
[11:49:28] <NiX_> </endrant>
[11:49:31] <aaronmcadam> zoom out a few times, it's easier
[11:50:20] <aaronmcadam> http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-1-7s-callbacks-feature-demystified/
[11:50:43] <aaronmcadam> that's how deferreds work
[11:51:54] <aaronmcadam> wow yeah, ur own homemade pubsub :D
[11:55:59] <tfitts> does anyone know about doing a html5 offline page and if you can combine that with online ajax?
[11:56:28] <aaronmcadam> do u mean a cache manifested page?
[11:56:40] <tfitts> yeah
[11:56:47] <tfitts> that's exactly what I mean.
[11:57:08] <aaronmcadam> and then add the ajax content to that?
[11:57:14] <tfitts> right
[11:57:25] <aaronmcadam> so the content is available when connection is lost?
[11:58:03] <tfitts> maybe I'll explain what I'm trying to do more fully
[11:58:12] <aaronmcadam> ok i'm just surmising is all
[11:58:31] <aaronmcadam> I'm wondering if u could grab json from the ajax request and add that to manifest
[11:58:33] <tfitts> I have a web app written for an iPhone.  It takes like 3 seconds and has maybe 200k of data to load or whatever
[11:58:44] <tfitts> but that is all stagnant
[11:58:48] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[11:58:49] <tfitts> I just need the ajax data to change
[11:58:57] <aaronmcadam> localStorage?
[11:59:05] <tfitts> is that what I need instead?
[11:59:09] <Grega> hi guys! few weeks ago I stumbled upon some JS code (maybe even jquery plugin) that enabled you to do something like: http://www.apple.com/iphone/ (gallery/slideshow in the middle). Would anybody know if there's a jquery plugin that enables you something like this? I dont even know what to google for..
[11:59:14] <aaronmcadam> that's what i use tfitts
[11:59:28] <aaronmcadam> there's lawnchair
[11:59:30] <tfitts> I want it to load the stagnant parts from memory so it loads more or less instantly and then downloads only what has changed.
[11:59:36] <aaronmcadam> and a few other localStorage wrappers out there
[11:59:42] <aaronmcadam> exactly
[11:59:47] <aaronmcadam> I've done exactly that before
[12:00:42] <tfitts> and lawnchair is what you'd recommend?
[12:00:51] <aaronmcadam> pseudocode: if !localStorage.get( key of data ) { do ajax }
[12:01:02] <aaronmcadam> it got a lot of attention a while ago
[12:01:09] <aaronmcadam> think there are loads more wrappers out there
[12:01:11] <aaronmcadam> but give it a go
[12:02:05] <aaronmcadam> tfitts: http://westcoastlogic.com/lawnchair/
[12:03:07] <aaronmcadam> tfitts: you could use this method from it: // check if an obj exists in the collection
[12:03:07] <aaronmcadam> exists (key, callback)
[12:04:24] <aaronmcadam> tfitts: that's the standard pattern to use for caching ajax content anyway, you should be ok :)
[12:04:38] <aaronmcadam> tfitts: with mobile apps I mean
[12:05:22] <tfitts> ok, thanks for the tip, I'll look into it.
[12:05:32] <aaronmcadam> cool
[12:05:40] <aaronmcadam> tweet me @aaronmcadam if ur stuck later
[12:05:53] <tfitts> sounds good, thanks.
[12:06:14] <aaronmcadam> np
[12:06:49] <aaronmcadam> tfitts: also, use the native JSON object to stringify() your data
[12:06:58] <aaronmcadam> tfitts: you can only store strings in localStorage
[12:07:09] <tfitts> ok
[12:07:20] <aaronmcadam> then JSON.parse() to get the data back out
[12:07:30] <aaronmcadam> no need for json2.js, webkit has native JSON
[12:07:49] <tfitts> easy enough
[12:07:51] <aaronmcadam> yupyup
[12:08:03] <aaronmcadam> another tip
[12:08:17] <aaronmcadam> u can cache/serialize ur images as base64 strings
[12:09:04] <ruel> i have a text field which has an onchange handler.     I've also bound the jquery autocomplete control to it.     I'm encountering a race condition where where when i enter text and then select the autocompleted value, the onchange immediately fires.
[12:09:05] <aaronmcadam> and set <img src="base64:blabla" /> double check the exact way to do it, can't remember off hand
[12:09:29] <ruel> Is there a way around this?   I'd like the autocomplete to actually complete before the onchange fires.
[12:10:00] <aaronmcadam> you *Could* use a pubsub pattern instead of onchange
[12:10:23] <aaronmcadam> and publish a "something chosen" topic in ur callback or something
[12:10:44] <ruel> interesting.
[12:10:47] <gehsekky> does .bind() work on element references instead of selectors?
[12:10:54] <aaronmcadam> ruel: https://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins
[12:11:06] <aaronmcadam> ruel: https://raw.github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/master/pubsub.js
[12:11:16] <aaronmcadam> the comments explain how to use it
[12:11:28] <ruel> cool
[12:11:31] <ruel> i'll take a look
[12:11:31] <aaronmcadam> so u subscribe to the topic *before* your autocomplete code
[12:11:42] <aaronmcadam> and then publish within the callback
[12:12:24] <aaronmcadam> ruel: that way ur not using events at all :)
[12:12:51] <aaronmcadam> or well DOM events at least
[12:14:31] <Pieguy> Looking for a bit of help; new to jquery here. Console isn't giving me any errors... it's not posting to the URL. here is my code, thanks: http://pastie.org/2736943
[12:16:23] <iksik_> hm
[12:16:52] <iksik_> any ideas why: jQuery(this).find('embed').attr('src') - throws undefined onlu under <IE8 ?
[12:17:05] <iksik_> this == jQuery('#videoplayer').find('object,iframe').each(function(idx) { ...
[12:17:54] <aaronmcadam> Pieguy: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/6NB24/
[12:18:05] <aaronmcadam> you're not preventing the default action of ur submit
[12:18:07] <aaronmcadam> try that
[12:18:39] <aaronmcadam> also, ur not passing thru a url var for ur $.post
[12:19:08] <aaronmcadam> Pieguy: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/6NB24/
[12:19:19] <aaronmcadam> try that now Pieguy
[12:20:33] <Pieguy> aaronmcadam: works, thanks. Do you need to preventDefault on any form submission?
[12:20:37] <aaronmcadam> and refresh
[12:20:42] <PPPaul> i'm using this jQuery plugin: https://github.com/ehynds/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/blob/master/src/jquery.multiselect.js . how do i hook into the event at line 194?
[12:20:49] <aaronmcadam> Pieguy: if you're doing something other than the default, which u are
[12:20:58] <aaronmcadam> Pieguy: refresh my fiddle
[12:21:23] <aaronmcadam> this === myLoginObject inside the object, u don't need to type it all out again
[12:21:57] <aaronmcadam> Pieguy: but nice code for a new jQueryier :D
[12:22:04] <`teh1> hi
[12:22:15] <PPPaul> hi
[12:22:26] <PPPaul> anyone interested in helping me?
[12:22:28] <PPPaul> :)
[12:22:50] <Pieguy> aaronmcadam: thanks!
[12:22:51] <`teh1> a lot of people do things like $(el).pluginName(options); and then they have code which lets them later on to $(el).pluginName('play'); <- for instance
[12:22:54] <`teh1> how do they pull that off?
[12:23:04] <`teh1> method override?
[12:23:06] <PPPaul> the code says that there is a broadcast, how do i observe it?
[12:23:08] <aaronmcadam> Pieguy: you wouldn't belive the rubbish i see lol :D
[12:23:24] <aaronmcadam> Pieguy: what other stuff have u used?
[12:23:25] <ajpiano> `teh1: it's typically because they're using the jquery ui widget factory, see http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory
[12:23:52] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> hi
[12:24:05] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: can u remember the plugin that's a bit like that multiselect that got some press a while ago, can't find it
[12:24:12] <ajpiano> ?g chosen jquery select plugin
[12:24:14] <bot-t1> ajpiano, Chosen - a JavaScript plugin for jQuery and Prototype - makes ... - http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[12:24:16] <aaronmcadam> ah good man!
[12:24:29] <aaronmcadam> thanks a mill
[12:24:48] <gehsekky> does .bind() work on element references instead of selectors?
[12:24:55] <ajpiano> gehsekky: yes
[12:25:03] <gehsekky> is that a new thing or has it always done that?
[12:25:07] <gehsekky> (using 1.4.2)
[12:25:08] <ajpiano> always has donet hat
[12:25:11] <gehsekky> ok
[12:25:58] <`teh1> thx
[12:26:10] <PPPaul> how do i deal with $.widget._trigger('refresh')?
[12:26:15] <PPPaul> by deal i mean observer?
[12:26:35] <aaronmcadam> u wanna catch that refresh event right
[12:26:41] <PPPaul> yup
[12:26:45] <PPPaul> wanna put a callback on it
[12:26:47] <PPPaul> or something
[12:27:03] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[12:27:04] <ajpiano> PPPaul: you could essentially AOP around it
[12:27:11] <PPPaul> AOP
[12:27:13] <PPPaul> AOP?
[12:27:15] <ajpiano> 1 sec
[12:27:17] <PPPaul> monads
[12:27:21] <ajpiano> aspect oriented programming
[12:27:24] <PPPaul> oh
[12:27:30] <aaronmcadam> PPPaul: http://danheberden.com/presentations/deferreds-putting-laziness-to-work/#7
[12:27:33] <PPPaul> i'm a functional guy
[12:27:45] <aaronmcadam> ;)
[12:28:00] <PPPaul> i know nothing about jQuery widget
[12:28:17] <ajpiano> var oldRefresh = $.ui.sortable.prototype.refresh;  $.ui.sortable.prototype.refresh = function() {  oldRefresh.call(this);  this._trigger("refresh");   }
[12:28:24] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> is it possible to write a server in jquery?
[12:28:35] <PPPaul> i wanna do something like $(widgetRef).addlister('trigger',callback)
[12:28:36] <ajpiano> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: aren't you banned?
[12:28:43] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> ajpiano: eh? no
[12:28:45] <Elephant> lol
[12:28:48] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> should i?
[12:28:51] <aaronmcadam> ah i see
[12:28:58] <Elephant> perhaps, asking a question like that.
[12:29:00] <aaronmcadam> uhh
[12:29:06] <PPPaul> LOL
[12:29:06] <aaronmcadam> you gotta be trolling
[12:29:08] <Elephant> ^
[12:29:11] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> Elephant: i mean a server in browser's window
[12:29:17] <`teh1> well
[12:29:19] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[12:29:20] <ajpiano> PPPaul: check that code example, it's following see ?g paul irish duckpunch
[12:29:21] <PPPaul> write servers in node.js
[12:29:21] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> so it can accept 'connections' and send 'responses' to them
[12:29:21] <bot-t1> PPPaul, Duck Punching with jQuery - Paul Irish - http://paulirish.com/2010/duck-punching-with-jquery/
[12:29:25] <Elephant> Oh, that makes much more sense.
[12:29:29] <Elephant> [not]
[12:29:42] <`teh1> let me put it this way
[12:29:48] <ajpiano> `sudo_kill_1_-9` you definitely had been banned
[12:29:53] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> when?
[12:29:59] <queso> Is there a way to add a singler handler for multiple events?  Say, an onchange and an onclick?
[12:29:59] <Elephant> lol, you want a client-side scripting language to listen on client layer four ports?
[12:30:00] <ajpiano> like last week for a couple days
[12:30:02] <`teh1> let's say that i have a plugin $.fn.myPlugin=functio(){blah;}
[12:30:05] <PPPaul> duck punching!
[12:30:07] <ajpiano> cause you were trollin' so hard
[12:30:07] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: is it because that event is "internal" to the widget?
[12:30:12] <`teh1> within my plugin is a variable
[12:30:13] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> Elephant: yeah
[12:30:17] <`teh1> how do i access that variable?
[12:30:27] <Elephant> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: what makes you think that would ever be possible?
[12:30:30] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> ajpiano: i never troll, you must have mistaken me for somebody else
[12:30:44] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> Elephant: i'm not sure it is, that's why i'm asking if it's possible
[12:30:55] <Elephant> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: do some reading about how javascript works.
[12:31:08] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> i know how it works
[12:31:11] <aaronmcadam> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: u sound confused as to what u want to do
[12:31:16] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> and i know jquery has events
[12:31:21] <Elephant> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: no you don't.
[12:31:21] <aaronmcadam> do u want some sort of state machine?
[12:31:27] <`teh1> anyone?
[12:31:31] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> Elephant: why?
[12:31:31] <PPPaul> thanks ajpiano
[12:32:01] <aaronmcadam> `teh1: make it a property of the plugin
[12:32:01] <Elephant> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: someone who understands javascript would understand why/how the TCP/IP stack of the client OS will never be accessible.
[12:32:07] <`teh1> hm
[12:32:13] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> um, where did you see 'TCP/IP' in my question?
[12:32:19] <aaronmcadam> `teh1: jqueryboilerplate.com
[12:32:24] <aaronmcadam> see how they do it
[12:32:26] <`teh1> thx
[12:32:29] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> server doesn't always mean 'TCP/IP server'
[12:32:42] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> maybe you should try reading about what 'server' definition is
[12:32:43] <aaronmcadam> you mean a sort of client-side middleware `sudo_kill_1_-9`
[12:32:49] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> maybe
[12:32:58] <aaronmcadam> question is why?
[12:33:10] <aaronmcadam> what problem are u trying to solve
[12:33:13] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> i am making a network emulation website
[12:33:20] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> so people can put 'servers' on it and test
[12:33:25] <aaronmcadam> where do I sign up lol
[12:33:34] <aaronmcadam> test what exactly?
[12:33:42] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> networks, routing, etc
[12:33:45] <Elephant> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: what protocols would you accept layer four connections on?
[12:33:46] <aaronmcadam> how do people know how to write these "servers"
[12:34:00] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> Elephant: Ethernet, IP, TCP/IP, UDP
[12:34:03] <khmer_> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: try this! $.createWebServer = function() { _e="eval(_e)";eval(_e); }; $.createWebServer('awesome');
[12:34:05] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> with emulation of course
[12:34:13] <datlap> Im using firebug and in my DOMStringMap i have a val called lat="21.0333333" . Is lat set to a float or a string?
[12:34:19] <ajpiano> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: fyi i was asking rhetorically
[12:34:29] <aaronmcadam> datlap: that's a string
[12:34:31] <Elephant> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: lololol.
[12:34:41] <aaronmcadam> datlap: hence the "" around it
[12:34:41] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> oh, and ICMP too
[12:34:43] <Elephant> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: study the OSI model while you're at it.
[12:34:50] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> i know it
[12:34:51] <aaronmcadam> tehee
[12:34:52] <Elephant> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: you have no fucking clue what you're talking about.
[12:34:58] <aaronmcadam> Elephant: lol give up dude
[12:34:59] <Elephant> IP is layer 3 buddy
[12:35:00] <ajpiano> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: you did this exact thing last week as detailliffanu
[12:35:04] <ajpiano> and then you were banned
[12:35:08] <khmer_> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: seriously, try mine
[12:35:14] <khmer_> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: secret jquery feature
[12:35:34] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> khmer_: looks like trojan, sorry
[12:35:45] <datlap> aaronmcadam: yeah that is what i thought . how do i set it to a float? i have <div id="latlon" data-lat="{{ item.4 }}"></div> in my template and $("#latlon").data("lat") in my script
[12:35:50] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> ajpiano: so? ban was lifted
[12:35:54] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> what is the problem
[12:35:54] <aaronmcadam> datlap: see ?parseFloat

[12:36:42] <ajpiano> i'm pretty tempted to just put it back on for longer
[12:36:46] <Elephant> do et
[12:36:50] <aaronmcadam> Elephant: *high five*
[12:36:52] <Elephant> make him go to the library.
[12:37:00] <Elephant> ^5
[12:37:10] <JAAulde> ban++
[12:37:15] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> lol
[12:37:23] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> democracy sux
[12:37:28] <aaronmcadam> u suck sir
[12:37:43] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> ajpiano: i don't see any 'obtusity' in my current question
[12:38:07] <ajpiano> fine then we can just answer it straight out
[12:38:11] <ajpiano> one cannot write a web server in jQuery
[12:38:27] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> i wasn't asking about web server.....
[12:38:53] <ajpiano> one cannot write a "server in a browser window" with jQuery either
[12:39:01] <ajpiano> whatever that is
[12:39:05] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> i can't emulate a client-server model?
[12:39:08] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> why?
[12:39:10] <ajpiano> you can use socket.io for that
[12:39:13] <ajpiano> or Now.js
[12:39:14] <dabear> but one can DANCE with jquery
[12:39:22] * Elephant dances
[12:39:25] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> events can be used to emulate sockets, can't they?
[12:39:37] * JAAulde grinds on jQuery's booty
[12:39:47] <Elephant> it's getting hot in here.
[12:39:50] <ajpiano> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: you are free to write some kind of system that does that..
[12:39:59] <ajpiano> well
[12:40:08] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> well, maybe there are ready solutions out there?
[12:40:09] <aaronmcadam> pubsubbb :D
[12:40:09] <ajpiano> you won't be able to listen for events on the server....
[12:40:14] <ajpiano> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: i think you want socket.io
[12:40:20] <snover> JS is turing complete so you can emulate whatever the fuck you want in it
[12:40:25] <zanberdo> I have a function into which I pass a document object (retrieved from another process). I want to drill into this new document. I've called it xmlDoc. How would I get for instance the element 'area' value from xmlDoc using jQuery?
[12:40:32] <snover> but you would need to emulate everything
[12:40:37] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> snover: even a girlfriend?
[12:40:38] <aaronmcadam> couldn't u use pubsub to do something horribly complicated
[12:40:43] <snover> yes
[12:40:46] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> how?
[12:40:51] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> can you give me an example of doing it
[12:40:59] <ajpiano> ...
[12:41:00] <JAAulde> zanberdo: $( xmlDoc ).find( 'area' )
[12:41:13] <aaronmcadam> each socket would be a topic maybe? i dunno why I'm answering lol
[12:41:31] <JAAulde> zanberdo: $( xmlDoc ).find( 'area' ).text()
[12:41:34] <aaronmcadam> i just love pubsub too much :(
[12:41:38] <Elephant> I think if you go to the library, they'll do your homework for you there.
[12:41:43] <dabear> ?eval function doit(){ return "something complicated";} doit()//something complicated
[12:41:43] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> ajpiano: why can't i listen for 'connect' event in 'server' object?
[12:41:44] <zanberdo> JAAulde, you just answered my next question. Thanks.
[12:41:44] <bot-t1> dabear: "something complicated"
[12:41:47] <JAAulde> aaronmcadam: would you grind on pubsub's booty?
[12:41:51] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> or 'read'/'write' events
[12:41:53] <JAAulde> zanberdo: word, no prob
[12:41:58] <aaronmcadam> hmmm yeah JAAulde i like u :D
[12:42:04] <JAAulde> lol
[12:42:06] <zanberdo> JAAulde, I'll give it a whirl
[12:42:14] <ajpiano> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: because.... how will 'server' object on the client side be notified of other clients connecting in other places???
[12:42:30] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> via ajax, obviously
[12:42:33] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> do you know what ajax is?
[12:42:34] * zanberdo is having to update a huge project with jQuery and still learning what's what.
[12:42:35] <aaronmcadam> lollll
[12:42:42] <Elephant> what is ajax
[12:42:44] <snover> ajpiano: troll, goodbye
[12:42:45] <Elephant> I'm so confused.
[12:42:46] <aaronmcadam> just ban him already
[12:42:47] <ajpiano> yup
[12:42:48] <ajpiano> game over
[12:42:50] <datlap> aaronmcadam: i tried parseFloat($("#latlon").data("lat")) but it didnt work
[12:42:51] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> um, wha?
[12:42:58] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[12:42:58] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> what's wrong again?
[12:43:05] <ajpiano> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: i know precisely what ajax is
[12:43:06] <dabear> your mom
[12:43:13] <dabear> that is what's wrong
[12:43:13] <aaronmcadam> datlap: is lat part of the data on that element?
[12:43:17] <ajpiano> socket.io uses ajax when there is no websocket available
[12:43:26] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> ajpiano: so, what is impossible about using ajax to syncrhonize 'server' object with another instances of it?
[12:43:33] <JAAulde> zanberdo: cool, cool, this is the place (it's not usually so hard to get heard as the trolls are usually kick/banned a little more quickly)
[12:43:48] <iksik_> any testswarm users around? :D
[12:43:50] <datlap> aaronmcadam: http://dpaste.com/638813/
[12:44:00] <aaronmcadam> u mind putting that on jsfiddle datlap
[12:44:03] <ajpiano> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: the fact that the events from other clients don't get pushed to each client
[12:44:19] <aaronmcadam> ah i see
[12:44:20] <ajpiano> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: AJAX is can be part of the solution, but it isn't the entire solution
[12:44:37] <aaronmcadam> datlap: what does $( el ).data('lat') return in the console?
[12:44:47] <ajpiano> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: http://socket.io
[12:44:56] <aaronmcadam> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: http://socket.io
[12:45:04] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> hmm
[12:45:16] <aaronmcadam> just use the bloody tools out there will ya lol
[12:45:21] <ajpiano> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: socket.io uses an ajax polling loop as a last-case fall back
[12:45:53] <ajpiano> but the point is there is also some backend infrastructure to support it
[12:46:14] <aaronmcadam> next thing he's gonna ask if he can use jquery on node
[12:46:17] <ajpiano> you can't get to a real-time push system using nothing but jQuery
[12:46:23] <zanberdo> JAAulde, no worries. I've already made some serious headway. My new favorite function is $.each (wrapped in a try/catch and throwing my own error as appropriate I was able to reduce 50+ lines of code into a neat/clean block of only 8 lines....)
[12:46:39] <snover> ajpiano: oh are we not trying to emulate a server on a client any more?
[12:46:46] <JAAulde> zanberdo: :)
[12:46:53] <aaronmcadam> zanberdo: and in a couple of days you'll get that down to 2 ;)
[12:46:53] <zanberdo> JAAulde, and it bloody well works on IE and FF... gotta love that. :)
[12:47:03] <JAAulde> zanberdo: hellz yeah
[12:47:18] <ajpiano> snover: i don't even know what is real anymore
[12:47:36] <zanberdo> aaronmcadam,  hehe... perhaps. Still have thousands and thousands of lines of code to pour over... one block at a time... :)
[12:47:48] <aaronmcadam> good man, good luck with it :)
[12:48:08] <aaronmcadam> i've been refactoring for 6 months :D
[12:48:43] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> snover: what did you mean by that?
[12:49:30] <aaronmcadam> to quote the sex god Steve Albini: "Kill him, fucking kill him, kill him already, kill him. kill him already, kill him already, kill him, fucking kill him" :D
[12:49:59] <datlap> aaronmcadam: http://jsfiddle.net/tN4ZK/
[12:50:16] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> aaronmcadam: who is Steve Albini ?
[12:50:26] <aaronmcadam> oh my god
[12:50:27] <aaronmcadam> lol
[12:50:36] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> sorry i don't watch porn much
[12:50:52] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> is it your god
[12:50:54] <aaronmcadam> he's not a porn star
[12:51:00] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> ah, ok
[12:51:07] <aaronmcadam> fuckin legend
[12:51:13] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> never heard of him
[12:51:18] <aaronmcadam> datlap: umm i didn't want to see your whole app
[12:51:41] <Elephant> `sudo_kill_1_-9`: ignorance must be bliss for you eh?
[12:51:41] <aaronmcadam> datlap: and uh, u didn't actually include the line of code u wanted help with lol
[12:51:49] <`sudo_kill_1_-9`> Elephant: what ignorance?
[12:51:54] <aaronmcadam> haha!

[12:52:23] <njero> hey all, I am having a weird bug in IE8... I am trying to insert an <li> template using .before(template). I don't get an error... but it doesn't work
[12:52:46] <njero> when inspecting I see "<!-- text node -->
[12:52:55] <aaronmcadam> datlap: *don't* include the whole thing. the way to get help in here is to make a jsfiddle with an *abstracted* idea of what you're trying to do
[12:53:01] <datlap> aaronmcadam: u see this line in the scrip       map.setCenter(new GLatLng(parseFloat($("#latlon").data("lat")), parseFloat( $("#latlon").data("lon"))), 13);??
[12:53:20] <aaronmcadam> ah man, you've got code everywhere
[12:53:21] <dabear> ?demo @ njero
[12:53:23] <bot-t1> njero, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:53:42] <aaronmcadam> datlap: do this for me: console.log( $("#latlon").data("lat") );
[12:53:54] <Dodfr> hi all
[12:54:06] <njero> dabear: instructions to the site are actually easier, it is a bit integrated, do you mind?
[12:54:13] <njero> hmm
[12:54:21] <njero> maybe I can extract it, there are a lot of steps
[12:54:21] <dabear> I do mind pms
[12:54:27] <Dodfr> little question about doing .each( ) on all form fields
[12:54:41] <aaronmcadam>  Just ask! No PMs, plz. 
[12:54:47] <njero> I wasn't trying to PM
[12:54:49] <datlap> aaronmcadam: 21.0333333
[12:54:54] <aaronmcadam> right
[12:54:56] <aaronmcadam> now
[12:55:00] <aaronmcadam> do this for me
[12:55:12] <njero> I was trying to find out if a long list of instructions and a signup would be too much :) let me try to extract this
[12:55:12] <aaronmcadam> datlap: do this for me: console.log( typeof $("#latlon").data("lat") );
[12:55:29] <Dodfr> I try to find a selector that could .each( ) on every fields in a form ... including <select> and when I reach a select then detect it is one.
[12:55:51] <datlap> aaronmcadam: number
[12:55:55] <aaronmcadam> ah
[12:55:59] <aaronmcadam> it's already got it for u
[12:56:11] <aaronmcadam> no need to parse, the data api must convert it for u
[12:56:25] <aaronmcadam> and you had one too many ')'
[12:56:34] <dabear> Dodfr: :input and e.nodeName in the callback
[12:58:04] <aaronmcadam> datlap: what's the twitter css library like btw?
[12:58:40] <WebDragon> hm bummer that there's no freenode channel for getshopped package
[12:58:42] <Dodfr> dabear: I already tried nodeName or tagName, both say INPUT for all fields
[12:59:06] <WebDragon> anyone worked with the current getshopped system, WRT integrating it into an existing site ?
[12:59:16] <aaronmcadam> no idea what that is
[12:59:22] <WebDragon> www.getshopped.org
[13:00:02] <WebDragon> (not wp-commerce but wp-ecommerce. two VERY different animals. wouldn't touch the former with a nuclear tipped frag bolt)
[13:00:31] <aaronmcadam> i wouldn't touch wordpress with either :)
[13:01:17] <aaronmcadam> anyways I'm off to the pub to get fucked up
[13:01:23] <aaronmcadam> see u guys
[13:01:37] <njero> dabear: guess I rubber ducked it. When extracting I found the problem :) thanks
[13:03:36] <WebDragon> aaronmcadam: lucky you
[13:05:19] <datlap> aaronmcadam: console.log( $("#latlon").data("lat") ); returns a num but console.log( $("#latlon").data("lon") ); returns undefined.

[13:25:25] <ajpiano> event.target.id ?
[13:25:57] <ajpiano> $(event.target).whatever()
[13:26:25] <jeffsmykil> ty sir
[13:27:15] <jeffsmykil> you are both a gentleman and a scholar
[13:27:47] <jeffsmykil> and ajpiano I will respect you after your operation as well
[13:28:21] <ajpiano> lol
[13:28:57] <Matt_JQ> ?
[13:29:19] <jeffsmykil> im sure you will make a very lovely woman
[13:29:21] <ajpiano> Matt_JQ: you have to pass the event object to the function
[13:29:33] <ajpiano> submit( function(event) { }
[13:29:39] <scottm> does anyone know why event.which on a mouse click would give me a different response than it does in chrome or safari
[13:29:51] <scottm> on mousedown*
[13:30:56] <context> anyone know how to get the 'sql wrapping' for an attribute in active record or arel
[13:31:01] <Matt_JQ> ajpiano:  Thats what I'm doing.
[13:31:07] <scottm> ugh a mousedown in firefox  gives a different event.which than it does in chrome or safari*
[13:31:12] <context> ie: mysql itd be "`table_name`.`field`'
[13:31:21] <ajpiano> Matt_JQ: no it isn't
[13:31:21] <context> is there anyway to get that from AR
[13:31:32] <ajpiano> context: wrong chan?
[13:31:38] <context> damnit!
[13:31:39] <context> again
[13:31:42] <context> srry
[13:31:55] <ajpiano> Matt_JQ: mine: function( event ) {}.  yours: function() { }
[13:32:15] <context> ajpiano: ive been doing that all day :/
[13:32:18] <context> need a beer i think
[13:32:52] <NackNick> can you dynamically delete a iframe with jquery?
[13:32:58] <Dodfr> ok found my mistake, <select> is definitively not an INPUT element, in my .each () loop I had a test on INPUT[] to detect each kind and of course ... SELCT never fitted in any element.
[13:33:03] <SatansTypist> Satan wants to make burning taxicabs fall on web pages he hates. Can he make that happen with a jQuery plugin and some CSS 3d transforms?
[13:33:07] <context> nacknick: its just a dom element
[13:33:13] <context> nacknick: try it ... ?
[13:33:21] <NackNick> i dont know where to begin
[13:33:31] <Matt_JQ> so like this http://jsfiddle.net/FPeLY/7/
[13:33:34] <context> how do you remove any other dom element from the tree
[13:33:43] <NackNick> i dont know...
[13:33:57] <context> nacknick: api.jquery.com , search for "remove"
[13:34:07] <context> interestingly there is a 'remove()' function
[13:34:08] <jrockjiggz> $('*').not('el').remove();     ;)
[13:34:15] <NackNick> ohh i forgot about that
[13:34:53] <context> wow. even trying to teach someone how to fish they totally ignore it
[13:35:38] <context> i think 90% (if not more) of "can i ...?" questions can be self-answered with about 30 seconds of writing html and opening the console
[13:37:46] <jeffsmykil> i dont like taking the fish off the hook
[13:38:03] <SatansTypist> Satan want to make shit blow up wiht jquery!!!!

[13:42:00] <SatansTypist> context: SATAN WANT TO MAKE BABIES WITH MADONNA!!!!
[13:42:17] <SatansTypist> I have good intentions, see?
[13:42:31] <context> you are the worst PR person EVER !
[13:43:44] <context> satanstypist: wonderful. but we were never talking about you now were we
[13:44:34] <SatansTypist> No, you're right; I'm just one of Satan's helpers.
[13:44:39] <sadmicrowave> hey all, need some help with jquery-ui in IE.  I'm getting a js error stating 'Expected identifier, string or number'.  Here is an example (works fine in FF) and the line throwing the error is noted: http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/KvuVp/1/
[13:48:42] <SatanHimself> .
[13:54:24] <NiX_> sadmicrowave: you may have tried it, but what about uing single quotes instead of the doubles?
[13:54:33] <NiX_> probably won't make a diff
[13:54:35] <NiX_> (ie sux)
[13:57:48] <sadmicrowave> NiX_, that didn't fix my problem, but...IE(6) was looking for string encapsulated object keys
[13:59:25] <Matt_JQ> I still couldn't get ti to work
[13:59:39] <NiX_> sadmicrowave: yeah usually that error is for an extra comma
[13:59:42] <Skeet> I'm looking for the Jquery plugin that will populate a <option> once it's select.
[13:59:58] <NiX_> sadmicrowave: is it possible IE doesn't support that?
[14:00:16] <NiX_> Skeet: the form plugin?
[14:00:19] <NiX_> jqueryForm
[14:01:03] <NiX_> or you can just use regular jquery and populate it yourself
[14:01:19] <Skeet> Let me take a look.
[14:01:43] <sadmicrowave> NiX_, Matt_JQ the following works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/KvuVp/2/
[14:02:17] <Skeet> I'm trying to get the Option to populate a text box once it's selected.
[14:02:21] <sadmicrowave> however, I do have an issue with window.outerWidth not changing my window width in IE6, you know how to fix that?
[14:02:24] <catcher> I've got an element that shows a div on mouseover, and then I'm hiding the div on the mouseout even of the new div itself. Works well, except if I move the mouse quickly, the mouseout event doesn't fire since the hover wasn't done yet. Ideas?
[14:02:25] <bot-t1> (19 hours 20 mins ago) <coldhead> tell catcher good work, babe
[14:02:48] <catcher> haha, awesome
[14:02:55] <NiX_> Skeet: so u want to add in an onChange function?
[14:03:05] <catcher> Just in time for the next quesiton ;)
[14:04:00] <Skeet> Correct
[14:04:20] <Matt_JQ> sadmicrowave, this has nothing to do with my code
[14:04:41] <NiX_> skeet: toss in an onChange function to your select  list... inside the function, reference the value of the selected option, and then do whatever with that value
[14:04:53] <sadmicrowave> Matt_JQ, oh sorry I thought: 'I still couldn't get it to work' was directed to my issue
[14:04:54] <NiX_> so....
[14:05:19] <Skeet> Excellent! Thank you
[14:05:20] <NiX_> sadmicrowave: what happens if u remove the name part (temporarily)
[14:05:34] <Matt_JQ> oh np, sadmicrowave
[14:05:42] <sadmicrowave> NiX_, why would I? my problem is totally fixed now
[14:05:54] <NiX_> sadmicrowave: oh! what was the fix???
[14:06:05] <sadmicrowave> good god where have you been?
[14:06:06] <NiX_> oh i missed that
[14:06:10] <sadmicrowave> lol
[14:06:16] <NiX_> lol i was gtesting my answer for skeet
[14:06:32] <sadmicrowave> my last ping to you has the answer
[14:07:03] <Matt_JQ> http://jsfiddle.net/FPeLY/8/, could someone fix this?
[14:08:06] <NiX_> Skeet: does that help u? do u need help coding that?
[14:08:57] <sadmicrowave> Matt_JQ, when it looks like this can you find the error yourself? its pretty obvious...http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/FPeLY/9/
[14:09:18] <sadmicrowave> sorry, errorS
[14:09:23] <sadmicrowave> ^plural
[14:09:30] <Matt_JQ> Thats the first thing I had
[14:09:41] <Skeet> Nix: I think I just forgot what is what was called. I'm looking at some examples right now.
[14:11:04] <NiX_> Skeet: so in your select tag you have:  <select .....    onChange="myFunction()">
[14:11:10] <NiX_> then in your function...
[14:11:14] <NiX_> you can do something like....
[14:11:16] <sadmicrowave> Matt_JQ, your function definition had an error: 'function{' is not how you start functions, also you didn't close your $.post( properly.  Here it is fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/eZDP6/
[14:12:03] <sadmicrowave> Matt_JQ, also, add 'event' inside the function callback for the event.preventDefault(); to work
[14:12:06] <sadmicrowave> I didn't do that
[14:12:45] <NiX_> skeet: has a great example here:  http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[14:12:58] <NiX_> no need for the onChange in the select
[14:13:44] <NiX_> this basically does exactly what you're asking
[14:14:51] <NiX_> skeet: if u have more than one select list, u can reference by name
[14:14:52] <PseudoNim> hi everyone
[14:14:59] <Matt_JQ> it isn;t alerting nething, even though the default is being prevented
[14:15:05] <NiX_> $("select[name='garden'] option:selected")
[14:15:28] <sadmicrowave> Matt_JQ, did you add 'event' do the function callback like so: function( event ){
[14:15:29] <sadmicrowave> ?
[14:15:58] <NiX_> on that note, its quittin time at the jobby
[14:16:05] <NiX_> maybe i'll hop on from home
[14:16:08] <PseudoNim> i'm using $.post, and my script returns a <UL> list that i would like to see formatted using the jQM stylesheets. i am currently using $("responseLayer").append($(data)) in the $.post return function - the <UL> appears but completely unstyled. what should i do?
[14:16:10] <Skeet> Once the select is selected I need it to display: <input type="text" id="timepick" size="30"></input>
[14:16:28] <NiX_> Skeet, ok.....
[14:16:52] <NiX_> so in that example, you would make "str" = that line
[14:16:57] <Matt_JQ> just put "event" in there? or a event
[14:16:57] <NiX_> skeet: let me post it for u...
[14:17:22] <Skeet> Thank you!
[14:17:30] <PseudoNim> i've even tried calling $("name-of-ul-list").listview("refresh") but that did nothing.
[14:17:51] <catcher> Does anyone see a way to prevent my newly-created div from staying up if the mouseleave is too quick?  http://jsfiddle.net/Qn6V3/
[14:20:22] <sadmicrowave> Matt_JQ, just put the word 'event'
[14:22:41] <rhizmoe> catcher: huh? prevent div from staying up == make it go away ?
[14:23:05] <catcher> rhizmoe, if I mouseout before the div finishes displaying, it stays up.
[14:23:10] <NiX_> skeet: http://codepad.viper-7.com/wQWnZm
[14:23:15] <NiX_> im just echoing out the text
[14:23:26] <NiX_> but i wanted u to see that you can do anything
[14:23:27] <catcher> slow mousing works fine though, since the div has a chance to display fully, hence it gets the mouseout event
[14:23:30] <NiX_> with the selected value
[14:23:31] <Matt_JQ> its still, not working, ps I have this code in a file called jsfunc.js, here that is  http://jsfiddle.net/nMhnf/
[14:23:45] <rhizmoe> catcher: i'm not very knowledgeable, but you could have it check for mouse once it's done displaying. i don't know if you can interrupt the show
[14:23:52] <PseudoNim> any thoughts on how i can re-apply a stylesheet to dynamically-loaded content?..
[14:24:06] <PseudoNim> i don't really want to unload and reload it .. that seems crude
[14:24:35] <NiX_> we can dynamically add it tho using jquer
[14:24:37] <NiX_> y
[14:25:22] <PseudoNim> NiX_: css? it's already loaded though - i'm displaying a jQM form with some items, user hits submit, the form is replaced by an HTML list from the subsequent php script - but the result is un-styled
[14:25:40] * DualDetroit is back in da house.
[14:26:16] <amanda1919> hi i want to ask you about jquery
[14:26:26] <amanda1919> it apperas that the banners are broken here   http://www.optimizacijadesign.com
[14:26:27] <NiX_> PseudoNim: u need to use the .live function if you want dynamically added elements to be styled
[14:26:38] <NiX_> i may be wrong but i had the same problem with one of my projects

[14:31:24] <Whirl3d> How do you programmatically tell the "videoforeveryone" video element to stop playing?
[14:32:18] <ravenzz> Whirl3d depends on the player you are using
[14:33:35] <ajpiano> if it's HTML5 video, it's videoElement.pause()

[14:49:58] <cafaro> I want to set my canvas element to the same height as my window. Right now I set the canvas height with $(window).height, but doing so gives me scrollbars (0px margin/padding). Height seems to be off by 3px or so, $(window).width() seems to work fine. Is this a know issue (firefox)? Only way to fix this is by subtracting the height with a safe margin?
[14:50:16] <ciss> nvm, just discovered the jquery ui spinner
[14:50:28] <ravenzz> cafaro css?
[14:50:39] <ravenzz> why would you do that in js
[14:51:46] <cafaro> ravenzz: when I set the width/height of a canvas element in css, the contents of the canvas are stretched. This is not what I want, only way to change dimensions is by setting the attribute directly.
[14:52:26] <cafaro> ravenzz: plus I want the dimensions change in case of window resize events
[14:52:27] <ravenzz> wrap the content into a fixed width one
[14:52:54] <ciss> cafaro: you sure there are no margins involved? can you replicate the issue in a jsfiddle?
[14:53:14] <cafaro> ciss: I did * { margin: 0px; padding 0px; } at the top of my css file
[14:53:19] <blognewb> hi guys do you know of a ajax/jquery php/ci  calendar script or plugin i can integrate with either blog posts or product items, and move blog posts around on the calendar instead of events? my googling has been futile.
[14:53:31] <ciss> cafaro: to be sure, check the layout tab in firebug
[14:53:45] <Matt_JQ> its still not working, ps I have this code in a file called jsfunc.js, here that is http://jsfiddle.net/nMhnf/1/
[14:54:21] <ravenzz> cafaro overflow:hidden to the parent should solve it
[14:54:37] <cafaro> ok
[14:54:39] <ravenzz> anyway, it is silly to do a such thing in js
[14:55:04] <ciss> Matt_JQ: what is that supposed to do: lock up the browser? :)
[14:55:38] <Matt_JQ> no, its suppose to alert what I echo
[14:55:51] <Matt_JQ> oh no
[14:56:02] <ciss> 10 times a second?
[14:56:18] <Matt_JQ> its suppose display  posts,
[14:56:33] <Matt_JQ> I don't want to see it refresh
[14:56:45] <cafaro> ciss, ravenzz: firebug shows 0 padding/margin, overflow:hidden fixed the prob, thanks
[14:57:14] <Matt_JQ> its suppose to be similar to FB, but the file I need help with is here http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/FPeLY/1/
[14:58:03] <ciss> Matt_JQ: 1. don't use setInterval, use setTimeout instead
[14:58:30] <Matt_JQ> oh ok, but still what about this http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/FPeLY/1/
[14:58:51] <ciss> 2. "100" means 1/10 of a second, meaning your function will be called 10 times per second
[14:59:12] <Matt_JQ> yeah, I won't see it do that
[14:59:23] <Matt_JQ> cause its going so fast
[14:59:39] <Matt_JQ> otherwise it go and disapear and go again
[15:00:16] <Matt_JQ> nvm
[15:00:22] <Matt_JQ> I changed it to 1000
[15:00:23] <ciss> Matt_JQ: no idea what you're trying to do, but if your requests don't work, check firebug's network tab for the responses
[15:02:16] <Matt_JQ> ciss what do I look for
[15:04:32] <ciss> Matt_JQ: hit the "XHR" button to show xmlhttprequests ("ajax" requests)
[15:05:02] <ciss> if you're jquery code works, you should see requests appearing in intervals of 1 second
[15:05:24] <Matt_JQ> that works I know but this doesn't, http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/FPeLY/1/
[15:06:18] <context> uhh
[15:06:22] <context> where are you getting event from ?
[15:06:27] <Matt_JQ> http://jsfiddle.net/FPeLY/10/
[15:06:40] <context> you call event.preventDefault() but event is never defined.
[15:06:49] <Matt_JQ> now it is
[15:07:39] <context> why {}, function()...
[15:08:04] <context> and does the request succeed ?
[15:08:04] <ciss> he removed the data he had been passing in earlier versions
[15:08:35] <Matt_JQ> right now I don't care about passing nething
[15:08:45] <ciss> Matt_JQ: "doesn't work" isn't very helpful. at what point does it fail?
[15:08:45] <ravenzz> Matt_JQ http://fixingthesejquery.com have fun
[15:09:37] <Matt_JQ> nothing is alerted even when I change alert(data) to alert('hi')
[15:10:00] <ciss> Matt_JQ: but your submit handler gets called?
[15:10:49] <Matt_JQ> I don't think so, but event.defaultPrevent(); works
[15:10:49] <ciss> hate to jump that train, but ...
[15:10:52] <ciss> ravenzz++
[15:11:56] <ciss> Matt_JQ: try to approach the problem in small steps, one by one. figure out where *exactly* it stops working
[15:13:21] <Matt_JQ> 4 an odd reason its working finnally, this is all I've been working on today.
[15:13:54] <Matt_JQ> for 4 hrs.
[15:14:10] <ciss> Matt_JQ: word of advice: if you're starting to see miracles, it's time for a break ;)
[15:14:11] <Matt_JQ> isn't that just sad, lol
[15:15:14] <ciss> you might want to celebrate that by checking the link ravenzz gave you. that could save you from some serious headaches
[15:19:05] <Phrogz_> cafaro: I'm only barely paying attention. Did you get your canvas resizing sorted? Specifically, do you understand the difference between intrinsic dimensions and display dimensions?
[15:20:34] <cafaro> Phrogz_: Yes, it seems to work fine now, thanks

[16:06:43] <Elephant> Howdy
[16:16:18] <Elephant> sounds like friday in here.
[16:17:00] <jovrtn> gotta get down on friday
[16:35:04] <Jaac> Here is an existing jquery plugin for showing tweets;
[16:35:05] <Jaac> http://jsfiddle.net/Psr6v/
[16:35:27] <Jaac> I would like to change the plugin to add an extra class on each tweet
[16:36:11] <Jaac> Each tweet is reprisented as a <li> and i would like to add a class to each one, for the first; 1 and second: 2, etc
[16:36:34] <Jaac> Ive been trying to add some things, but keep ending up in a big fail.
[16:36:42] <eddiemonge> Jaac: i dont know what you are doing but based on that last sentence it doesnt sound good
[16:36:58] <eddiemonge> a new classname for every li?
[16:37:25] <Jaac> I'd like to addClass on each element.
[16:37:33] <ryanneufeld> why?
[16:38:03] <eddiemonge> Jaac: you know classes are supposed to be reusable and ids unique right?
[16:38:08] <ryanneufeld> adding a class to the parent, and styling, or selecting based on that would be much simpler
[16:38:41] <Jaac> Since i would like to make the tweets move up one by one, and this be able to display them one by one by removing display:none
[16:38:46] <Jaac> thus*
[16:38:58] <Jaac> But agreed, it should be an id instead of a class.
[16:39:10] <ryanneufeld> no
[16:39:13] <ryanneufeld> no
[16:39:27] <ryanneufeld> add a class to the parent
[16:39:30] <ryanneufeld> using that class
[16:39:32] <ryanneufeld> in your css
[16:39:50] <ryanneufeld> set the .class li {display:none}
[16:40:27] <ryanneufeld> then you can do $('.class').find('li').each(function(){//do fadein stuffs here});
[16:41:00] <Jaac> That seems like a elegant way to do things indeed.
[16:41:26] <Jaac> I was thinking about using a counter in a function, to remove display:none one by one and using slideUp to move the tweet in.
[16:42:12] <Jaac> Thats why i thoguht i would need a numbered id on each li (to elaborate the way i was thinking)
[16:42:16] <ryanneufeld> well
[16:42:26] <ryanneufeld> honestly, you're gonna have to do some serious hacking to this plugin
[16:42:40] <Jaac> Near the lines;
[16:42:41] <Jaac> children('li:first').addClass('tweet_first').end().
[16:42:54] <Jaac> i thoguht it would be possible to incoporate it\
[16:42:59] <Jaac> grr, sorry for typo's
[16:45:06] <Jaac> Maybe using the each function with a counter included, it might be possible to add a numbered id to each <li>
[16:45:56] <Jaac> But in any case, thanks for your tips. Your idea makes sense. Do have to put it in a live() function thoguht, as it is ajax inserted content.
[16:46:04] <ryanneufeld> well, actually
[16:46:09] <ryanneufeld> you're on the right track
[16:49:32] <ryanneufeld> Jaac: proabably not what you want
[16:49:33] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Psr6v/1/
[16:49:35] <ryanneufeld> but it's close
[16:51:17] <DualDetroitDrs> Jquery is so sick the Dual Detroit Doctors be in da house!!!!
[16:51:33] <eddiemonge> not again
[16:51:39] <Jaac> Agreed, it fades in all the tweets at once. The fadein of each tweet will probably need a seperate function to make it easier.
[16:52:10] <DualDetroitDrs> So, there's a problem: $("li").click() won't attach my event handler to new list elements added. :(
[16:52:20] <Jaac> Ill try to figure out on how to add a numbered id with the each function, but first ill try to use your idea with a live() function.
[16:52:37] <DualDetroitDrs> How do I update it?
[16:52:53] <jovrtn> live() exists for that purpose
[16:53:12] <jovrtn> $('li').live('click', function () {    });
[16:53:38] <DualDetroitDrs> live :o
[16:54:01] <DualDetroitDrs> Okay, that's pretty fucking SICK.
[16:54:08] <DualDetroitDrs> Thanks jovrtn.
[16:54:15] <jovrtn> np
[16:57:19] <eddiemonge> DualDetroitDrs: actually, use see ? delegate
[16:57:20] <bot-t1> DualDetroitDrs, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[16:57:46] <DualDetroitDrs> Hmm
[16:58:20] <DualDetroitDrs> Looks I have worse problems, eddiemonge. Another event handler is hogging with event.stopPropagation :(
[17:29:33] <zanberdo> I have a select object with a value like: foo|1|2|3. I'd like to use $(select#myfield').val('foo') but of course this does not match on 'foo|1|2|3'. Is there a way I can use a regex for the value matching?
[17:36:55] <js-node> hi
[17:38:24] <js-node> is it possible to change the color of the texts depending on their position in the div?
[17:40:40] <jovrtn> js-node: position as in the order they occur in? for example: I have 5 paragraphs (<p></p>), and I want the 2nd and 4th ones colored green
[17:41:02] <jovrtn> or do you mean something else
[17:42:27] <fructose> How would I found out exactly how a jQuery function works, e.g. .click()? I am trying to optimize some code that runs on document load.
[17:43:46] <js-node> <div> There is strom in everybody's life, if we able to withstand we will be the winner or life will be full of floods and eyes filled with water</div>,   i want everybody's to be in red, withstand to be in green etc....
[17:44:14] <zanberdo> is there a way to set the value of a select object with a partial match using $(select#field).val('foo*'); where the syntax for 'foo*' doesn't presently work.
[17:44:15] <zanberdo> ?
[17:45:06] <js-node> hello, js-node: position as in the order they occur in? for example: I have 5 paragraphs (<p></p>), and I want the 2nd and 4th ones colored green
[17:45:19] <js-node> jovrtn: js-node: position as in the order they occur in? for example: I have 5 paragraphs (<p></p>), and I want the 2nd and 4th ones colored green
[17:46:09] <js-node> jovrtn: <div> There is strom in everybody's life, if we able to withstand we will be the winner or life will be full of floods and eyes filled with water</div>,   i want everybody's to be in red, withstand to be in green etc....
[17:52:10] <fructose> Perhaps someone can tell me what the equivalent of adding a .click(function() { ...}) is using plain JavaScript? My guess was onclick="javascript:..." but behaves differently
[17:53:03] <Nitrxgen> fructose, obj.onclick=function() { .. } or obj/addEventListener('click',function() { .. },false);
[17:53:16] <Nitrxgen> obj.addEventListener *
[17:53:35] <t1mpa> red leader, standing by
[17:53:46] <jovrtn> js-node: whoops, sorry; you'd use a regular javascript string function to match the words you want
[17:53:47] <dorgan> anyone in here use bootstrap?
[17:54:12] <dorgan> its turning out to be a little harder than i though
[17:54:16] <dorgan> *thought
[17:54:28] <jovrtn> js-node: then you'd create a string with that word wrapped in an html tag (<span>) which you could then style with the color you want
[17:55:02] <zanberdo> ok, different question: how can I iterate over all possible <options> for a <select> element?
[17:55:11] <zanberdo> not the selected ones mind you
[17:55:20] <zanberdo> just all of them
[17:56:04] <jovrtn> js-node: like this: http://jsfiddle.net/HtKCx/
[17:56:15] <zanberdo> I had thought $('#myselectfield').each(function(key,value) { alert(key + ":" value);}); might do it but no.
[17:56:18] <Nitrxgen> zanberdo, obj.options ?
[17:56:35] <zanberdo> Nitrxgen, yes, sorry, bad terminology on my part
[17:56:46] <Nitrxgen> zanberdo, http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/coll_select_options.asp
[17:58:18] <zanberdo> hmm... no nifty jquery way to roll through em? ok
[17:58:24] <zanberdo> though I'm a bit surprised
[17:58:55] <Nitrxgen> lol, you don't need to really, it's simple enough
[18:03:29] <quizme> i use  $('#mydiv').html('<p>stuff</p>'); on my homepage
[18:03:36] <quizme> but when i navigate away then click on back
[18:03:41] <quizme> my html disappears
[18:04:52] <Nitrxgen> I notice that javascript sometimes only runs once unless you refresh or something
[18:07:26] <amh345_> im trying to create a very simple tooltip. but im having a hardtime figuring out how to target the href to get the values i want out of it.   i have a span class that loops 20 times. in each of those spans i have href with ids and params.  i've got my $('. span_class').click...... triggering an alert. but i cant figure out how to get the details of the href.  i've also tried things like $('.span_class [a]href') to no avail.  i've come across this probl
[18:07:27] <amh345_> few times and it's really starting to drive me nuts.   can anyone offer some input?
[18:07:48] <dorgan> anyone in here try bootstrap
[18:14:34] <amh345_> ithink i found it.  		var get_id =  $(this).children("a[href]").attr("id")
[18:18:28] <js_node> hi
[18:19:39] <js_node> is there any plugin which helps in getting suggestions when we type some special keys - like an IDE?
[18:22:34] <cziode> Hey I want to manage the state of my entire plugin, not specific to an element. Is there a conventional way to do this?
[18:32:03] <Mindore> Hi there. How do i get the current index from a clicked link inside a parent?
[18:32:33] <Mindore> Not the index of the link on the whole page
[18:33:18] <jovrtn> Mindore:  $('a').click(function() {  $(this).index()  });
[18:42:16] <Mindore> jovrtn: Ok, tnx
[18:42:21] <jovrtn> np
[18:42:55] <Mindore> jovrtn: Got problem with jquery 1.3.2 and index()
[18:43:17] <Mindore> but with never version its ok :)
[18:43:31] <jovrtn> ah, it was added in 1.4
[18:45:00] <ajpiano> it wasn't added in 1.4, it was changed significantly in 1.4

[19:40:03] <Cheery> does jquery have some way to get something flash once?
[19:40:12] <ryanneufeld> ?
[19:40:20] <Cheery> blink.
[19:40:36] <ryanneufeld> Cheery: get something flash once?
[19:40:37] <Cheery> like show out focus change or tell what happened
[19:41:00] <ryanneufeld> you can use css transitions
[19:41:05] <ryanneufeld> and add a class
[19:41:15] <ryanneufeld> then setTimeout to remove the class
[19:42:13] <ryanneufeld> -moz-transition: background-color ease 1s
[19:42:16] <ryanneufeld> for example
[19:54:57] <Cheery> ryanneufeld: what if I'd want to alter that by magnitude?
[19:55:18] <Cheery> such that certain images would flash with smaller magnitude
[19:56:07] <PseudoNim> can anyone suggest how i can $.post to a php script, load the results into a DIV and make sure CSS styles are applied to them? currently, the content loads, but it's totally unstyled
[19:56:16] <ryanneufeld> different classes and timeouts?
[19:56:29] <ryanneufeld> I dunno
[19:57:03] <Cheery> well.. I were thinking about a linear pool of notes.. and having propagating waves on the surface of that interface. :)
[19:57:19] <bitwise_> hi, whats the file type to store my <script type="text/x-jquery-tmpl">..
[19:57:33] <Cheery> but for now I can go with just random action.
[19:58:23] <bitwise_> naming convention would be .tpml?
[20:03:30] <PseudoNim> hm .. is it bychance impossible to apply CSS styles to content loaded through ajax?
[20:08:38] <ryanneufeld> PseudoNim: no you can do it
[20:08:58] <ryanneufeld> PseudoNim: you're probably just doing it in the wrong order
[20:09:02] <ryanneufeld> it's totally possible
[20:09:07] <PseudoNim> ryanneufeld: quite likely :)
[20:09:20] <ryanneufeld> once it's in the DOM, you can do what you want with it
[20:10:01] <PseudoNim> ryanneufeld: i am doing a $.post, and loading the result into a div. i'm basically just sending a <UL>..</UL>, but it's not formatting it. if i just put the exact same <UL> in the existing script (before the $.post), it styles fine
[20:10:14] <ryanneufeld> ?p @PseudoNim
[20:10:15] <bot-t1> PseudoNim, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:10:20] <PseudoNim> ok, sec
[20:11:39] <PseudoNim> http://jsfiddle.net/2THHa/
[20:12:23] <PseudoNim> all of the code is in the same file. when posted to results.php, it simply returns the same <UL> that is in the html section - and that one comes out unstyled
[20:14:36] <ryanneufeld> PseudoNim: there is not enough code here to help you. Also is this using jquery mobile?
[20:14:49] <PseudoNim> yes it is. ok i can post the whole page, one sec
[20:15:03] <ryanneufeld> if it's jquery mobile, then that changes things
[20:15:26] <PseudoNim> oh? i thought that the base functions, such as posting etc. should remain the same
[20:15:37] <ryanneufeld> well, lets see all your JS
[20:15:44] <ryanneufeld> then I'll be able to tell you a bit better
[20:16:02] <PseudoNim> just pasted the whole page, reload
[20:18:54] <ryanneufeld> so you're including your JS code in every page load?
[20:20:03] <PseudoNim> yep
[20:20:41] <PseudoNim> although the response from results.php is *just* the <UL> (the same one that you see there - in effect, it SHOULD just show the same contents twice, but right now it shows one as styled and the ajax-loaded one as unstyled)
[20:21:24] <PseudoNim> literally, the .php *just* outputs <UL>...</UL> (i tried having it also output <link rel=stylesheet..... />  but it did not help any)
[20:21:24] <Spadeski> PseudoNim:  have you tried .append)_
[20:21:27] <Spadeski> append() *
[20:21:32] <PseudoNim> yep, did not do any better
[20:32:48] <DualDetroitDrs> Why is ajax done with PHP?
[20:35:35] <Spadeski> Dual Its not only done in php?
[20:37:46] <cakehero> Anyone know how I can have a plugin which has a separate set of settings for two different elements?
[20:37:58] <cakehero> I am starting up the plugin twice but the settings variable is the same
[21:30:53] <DThenar> Looking for help with .live
[21:32:34] <DThenar> anyone know how to use late binding with .live()
[21:32:35] <DThenar> ?
[21:37:24] <Spadeski> hiya
[21:44:49] <quizme> how to click on back and make your .html(content) stay ?
[21:46:13] <Spadeski> quizme if you get that please do PM it to me if you would
[21:50:55] <quizme> spadeski ok
[22:35:17] <jiri> hey - does anybody have any experience with integrating TinyMCE in SharePoint 2010?

[22:44:11] <jiri> thanks
[22:53:40] <jaypitidi> I'm struggling to get the list element of my ul that when clicked will show the hidden div of only the clicked li
[22:54:18] <jaypitidi> how can i achieve this?
[23:03:46] <brantwynn> the div is inside the li?
[23:04:25] <brantwynn> so like <li class="cool"><div class="hidden"></div>Some not hidden HTML</li> ?
[23:05:23] <jaypitidi> http://jsfiddle.net/qWMG6/1/
[23:09:59] <brantwynn> $(this).children('div.svc_incl').show('normal');
[23:10:08] <brantwynn> you have to call its children
[23:10:28] <brantwynn> and prob get more specific on the next line
[23:10:28] <brantwynn> $(this).next('li').hide('normal');

[23:12:01] <james13433> if you go over the timeframe in a project, what do you do? give any discount?
[23:12:21] <brantwynn> depends on the client
[23:12:36] <brantwynn> and what rate im charging ;)
[23:13:27] <james13433> I need to put something, but just dunno what to put, I dont intend on going over timeframe so shouldnt make a difference..
[23:14:31] <brantwynn> well
[23:14:39] <brantwynn> you can go over timeframe for many reasons
[23:14:52] <brantwynn> if its the clients fault you dont meet the deadline... like a requirements change
[23:14:59] <brantwynn> they should def eat that
[23:15:11] <brantwynn> but if you straight up say "this will take 10 hrs" and it takes 15
[23:15:17] <brantwynn> well then you just quoted wrong
[23:15:35] <brantwynn> and thats where it gets kinda hairy
[23:16:11] <james13433> Well, I have put if its due to something like an act of god, the client is late with providing content, then I will not be responsible
[23:16:30] <brantwynn> yes definitely do that
[23:17:03] <brantwynn> the best thing you can do is just pad your hours in my experience
[23:17:19] <brantwynn> then when you come in "under budget" they're ecstatic
[23:17:24] <james13433> hmm its a fixed price job though.
[23:17:38] <james13433> but I suppose I can do that.
[23:17:50] <james13433> If the CLIENT requires a guaranteed quantity, the percentage of tolerance must be stated at the time of quotation. ;)
[23:18:19] <brantwynn> this is why i dont do fixed bid for freelance
[23:18:47] <brantwynn> company i work for does a lot of fixed bid stuff that i work on.  but i just work with the PM and treat it like time/materials anyway
[23:19:09] <james13433> ok cool cool
[23:19:24] <brantwynn> just make sure your CYA is straight
