[00:02:32] <rabbi1> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1058683/ tabCount returns just '1' always, anything wrong ?
[00:03:32] <juha_> rabbi1: seems valid
[00:03:49] <varnie> and, btw, comparing foo.val() == undefined is wrong, isn't it? it should be == "undefined".
[00:04:02] <juha_> rabbi1: i think you want #horiTabs li etc, as id is unique
[00:04:15] <juha_> varnie: still unvalid
[00:04:22] <coldhead> ?eval undefined === "undefined"
[00:04:27] <bot-t> coldhead: false
[00:04:30] <juha_> varnie: try typeof foo.val() == "undefined"
[00:04:31] <coldhead> they're two different things
[00:05:17] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone else help :x
[00:05:51] <juha_> no
[00:05:55] <juha_> everyone left :(
[00:06:12] <fRAiLtY-> Gah, think it's called event delegation
[00:11:35] <rabbi1> juha_: yeah, horiTabs is a div
[00:12:31] <rabbi1> juha_: ok, missed out to have a common class
[00:12:33] <juha_> rabbi1: well it can be anything, but my point was that #horiTabs is an id and id's are supposed to be unique, so it should only return 1
[00:12:51] <rabbi1> common class for each tabs :)
[00:14:22] <rabbi1> juha_: how can i get a lenght of tabs without mentioning a class for each tab, or how else can i target only the last tab with out mentioning the class name for each ?
[00:15:25] <mink> rabbi1,   last() function?
[00:17:45] <aro> whena  form is submitted, is there a way to know what submit button was used to invoke the aciton?
[00:19:49] <rookie84> aro: yes.
[00:20:30] <rookie84> something like $(this).is('.submit1');
[00:21:17] <aro> i am trying to create a script that will prevent a user from double submitting a form
[00:21:22] <aro> either by clicks or pressing enter
[00:21:56] <rabbi1> mink: yeah but something like div of ul of li.last()
[00:22:23] <mink> rabbi1, Paste this structure to jsfiddle.com
[00:22:23] <rabbi1> var tabCount = $(".tabs[ul][li]").last; will this work ? mink
[00:22:42] <mink> rabbi1, no, not work :(
[00:22:54] <mink> Paste it and show me what you want select with jquery
[00:23:05] <rabbi1> mink: http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/123/
[00:23:52] <mink> rabbi1, and what li you want select?
[00:24:34] <rabbi1> mink: last li of the horiTabs
[00:24:50] <rabbi1> mink: last li of the .tabs class, sorry
[00:25:32] <aro> rookie84: how will $(this).is('.submit1'); work
[00:25:58] <rookie84> aro: you said you wanted to know how would you kow which submit button was clicked?
[00:25:59] <aro> i am foreaching over the submit buttons ina form, i just want to know which one was used to invoke the submit action
[00:27:20] <rabbi1> mink: there is lot in it, may get confused :)
[00:28:04] <mink> $('.tab').find('li').last();
[00:28:06] <aro> this has to be a global script, i dont want to write one for every single form on the site
[00:28:15] <tw2113> http://www.noisemademedoit.com/dial-up-modem-slowed/
[00:28:17] <mink> rabbi1, but this return last li of lasted .tab
[00:29:03] <rabbi1> <div id="tabs"><ul><li></li><li></li><ul></div> i have a div id 'tabs' and need to target the last li of it
[00:29:31] <coldhead> $('#tabs li:last')
[00:29:54] <aro> i am using $(document.body).on('submit', 'form', function() { .... } );
[00:29:59] <ravenzz> or last()
[00:30:06] <rabbi1> coldhead: no need for ul ?
[00:30:44] <coldhead> hell no
[00:30:51] <coldhead> jQuery knows what you mean
[00:31:03] <ravenzz> rabbi1 probably you would select only the li that belongs to the navigation ul
[00:31:40] <ravenzz> if so you should use a more strict selector
[00:36:02] <aro> so does anyone know? or no
[00:36:13] <rabbi1> ravenzz: thanks
[00:36:36] <o]> do you know any free video reencoder?
[00:36:42] <aro> ffmpeg
[00:36:53] <o]> hmm that could help
[00:37:49] <aro> is there a way to know which submit button is invoked if the user presses enter in a text field?
[00:39:22] <coldhead> if they submit with enter then... they didn't use a submit button, no?
[00:39:36] <aro> coldhead - doesnt it default to one of them?
[00:39:53] <systemfault> Why would it?
[00:40:13] <aro> because the post data for a submit button is still sent, no?
[00:40:26] <o]> aro: sorry for bothering you with that. I just need to change the mp3 audio encoder from a video to any other that my tv supports
[00:40:39] <o]> I have ffmpeg on my pc. is there a way to list the codecs available with it
[00:40:42] <o]> ?
[00:40:54] <aro> o]: i think you are in the wrong channel
[00:41:23] <aro> coldhead: i just want to prevent double submits
[00:41:47] <systemfault> aro: Then forget about buttons and clicks..
[00:42:09] <systemfault> aro: When you click on a submit button, a "submit" event is fired
[00:42:34] <systemfault> You simply need to add a submit handler to the form
[00:42:37] <aro> systemfault: i am using the submit handler
[00:43:11] <aro> <aro> i am using $(document.body).on('submit', 'form', function() { .... } );
[00:44:04] <systemfault> Then what's the problem? If it's sending then prevent it from sending again
[00:44:28] <aro> how? disabling submit buttons will prevent their data from being posted
[00:45:30] <Cork> aro: add a check "submitting" set it to true when the event triggers
[00:45:46] <Cork> and set it to false, when its complete
[00:45:51] <systemfault> aro: You could for example, add an attribute on the form element.. data-sending="true" with jQuery when you're sending, then when you submit again, just check if the attribute is there
[00:45:52] <aro> ok
[00:46:32] <Cork> would prob been using .data instead, but ya
[00:47:02] <systemfault> Why not :)
[00:47:20] <Cork> unneeded dom modifications
[00:50:54] <coldhead> most of the the work we do is unneeded
[00:51:03] <coldhead> because no one really visits sites apart from facebook
[00:52:01] <systemfault> coldhead: and porn sites.
[00:52:16] <systemfault> Let's be honest for once.
[00:52:32] <coldhead> oh yeah, i always forget about those sites
[00:52:42] <juha_> coldhead, systemfault: what if one's work involves social porn sites? :/
[00:52:50] <coldhead> i can't visit them because i'm on the sex offenders register
[00:52:57] <coldhead> and they monitor my history
[00:53:13] <coldhead> yes your work is important, juha_
[00:53:16] <coldhead> never stop
[00:53:21] <systemfault> coldhead: Then switch to midget pr0n instead of CP :#
[00:53:23] <systemfault> :/
[00:53:34] <coldhead> is a slippery slope, systemfault
[00:53:39] <juha_> coldhead: so you're using an ascii-browser to surf on those sites?
[00:53:43] <systemfault> Yeah :(
[00:53:57] <coldhead> i am using the most powerful browser of them all: the human imagination
[00:54:01] <systemfault> juha_: It must be cool with lynx
[00:54:44] <systemfault> Y U LEAVE?
[00:54:53] <juha_> oh noes
[00:54:55] <juha_> they got him
[00:55:05] <systemfault> FBI :(
[00:55:24] <hrwath> lynx.... telnet on port 80 is the best, most geek
[00:55:52] <systemfault> hrwath: The best is to connect to a BBS with a 14.4 modem
[00:56:00] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/124/ how can i display submit button only on the last tab ?
[00:56:31] <hrwath> systemfault, yeah, but is there any working now?
[00:57:07] <systemfault> I don't think so :'(
[00:58:19] <neilma> hi
[01:07:43] <nafg_> rabbi1:
[01:09:20] <rabbi1> nafg_: yeah
[01:10:00] <nafg_> rabbi1: Why don't you just put it in div-4?
[01:11:04] <rabbi1> nafg_: :) .. yeah, but these managers keep changing their mind. once they said on all tabs, once they said on all tab except first one, now they are saying only on last tab....
[01:11:55] <nafg_> rabbi1: Well I can't help them make up their mind
[01:12:03] <nafg_> What sort of rabbi are you
[01:13:26] <rabbi1> nafg_: :)
[01:13:41] <nafg_> Are you Jewish?
[01:31:11] <sigurding> guys, doing a $.postJSON with a checkbox included I always have _enabled="on" in it, which destroys my binding on the server side. How do I avoid it, that _enabled="on" is attached?
[01:35:54] <Cork> sigurding: thats how a default param
[01:36:12] <sigurding> Cork: ?
[01:36:21] <Cork> as in, something in your page adds it
[01:36:26] <Cork> not jquery
[01:46:12] <Whirl3d> how do I convert a decimal color value into a value needed by the css background-color property?
[01:46:34] <Whirl3d> *integer, not decimal
[01:46:49] <Cork> you mean like 255 255?
[01:47:01] <Whirl3d> 751052
[01:47:04] <Cork> (not really decimal though :)
[01:47:16] <Whirl3d> hence the correction. LOL
[01:47:33] <Cork> and, what the values meant to be?
[01:47:35] <Whirl3d> 7551052, sorry
[01:47:46] <Cork> the color long?
[01:48:34] <Whirl3d> ugg, I'm afraid its: d35d2b
[01:48:53] <Whirl3d> the integer version
[01:48:57] <Cork> ah
[01:49:22] <Whirl3d> so, I need an integer to ____ converter...
[01:50:05] <Cork> ?eval >> '#' + (7551052).toString(16)
[01:50:07] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: syntax error
[01:50:12] <Cork> opps
[01:50:15] <Cork> ?eval '#' + (7551052).toString(16)
[01:50:15] <bot-t> Cork: "#73384c"
[01:50:50] <shoky> rgb(1,2,3) plz
[01:51:42] <shoky> nm
[01:53:19] <Whirl3d> jesus chrismas, if you try to look the shit up on google, there are so many UGLY UGLY pages devoted to geeking out on this that none of them actually gets to the point
[01:54:04] <shoky> why
[01:54:11] <shoky> ?g javascript decimal to hex
[01:54:12] <bot-t> shoky, How to convert decimal to hex in JavaScript? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/57803/how-to-convert-decimal-to-hex-in-javascript
[01:55:26] <Whirl3d> ?evall 7551052.toString(16)
[01:55:28] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Couldn't find "evall 7551052.toString(16)" in jQuery Docs.
[01:55:30] <Whirl3d> lol
[01:55:54] <Whirl3d> I am sooo close to being able to stop on this ridiculous project. I am worn the funk out.
[01:56:20] <systemfault> What's up?
[01:56:28] <shoky> where did you get a color value as decimal?
[01:56:36] * shoky sits on systemfault
[01:56:46] <systemfault> :(
[01:57:03] <shoky> you're not santa?
[01:57:22] <systemfault> Nope :/ I'm probably closer to satan than santa
[01:57:48] <shoky> ohh
[01:58:01] <systemfault> Whirl3d: How did you get that value? :/
[01:58:40] <Cork> ?eval var num = 7551052; var r = (num >> 16), g = (num - (r << 16)) >> 8, b = (num - (((r << 8) + g) << 8)); 'rgb(' + r + ', ' + g + ', ' + b + ')';
[01:58:40] <bot-t> Cork: "rgb(115, 56, 76)"
[01:58:53] <shoky> lol
[01:59:02] <Cork> satisfied?
[01:59:06] <Cork> ;P
[01:59:06] <shoky> :)
[01:59:25] <Cork> toString is simpler though :)
[02:04:07] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Whirl3d  kindly helped me with this on Friday, but I keep breaking it now. I tried putting these functions into an external.js file and when I call that it breaks ALL the js on the rest of the page: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/g58J6/8/
[02:04:32] <fRAiLtY-> I'm trying to put them functions somewhere tidy, then attempt to call them using Whirl3d's method, why would it destroy the whole page
[02:06:54] <shoky> ?eval var n=7551052; 'rgb('+(n>>16)+','+((n>>8)&255)+','+(n&255)+')'
[02:06:54] <bot-t> shoky: "rgb(115,56,76)"
[02:07:09] <Cork> yup :)
[02:07:28] <Cork> thought if that too, but had already posted the other one :)
[02:07:54] <Cork> (its still more complex then toString() :P)
[02:08:52] <Laird> hi
[02:09:00] <shoky> i still wonder how he got that as decimal though
[02:09:12] <Cork> what decimal?
[02:09:18] <shoky> the 7551052
[02:09:29] <Cork> 7551052 is decimal
[02:09:33] <shoky> where doe that come from, if not from an explicit hex->dec conversion ;p
[02:09:36] <Cork> or base 10
[02:09:47] <Laird> is there a way to bind to the completion of a ".load" ? for all loads? ajaxSuccess executes before the dom is changed by .load...
[02:09:52] <Cork> numbers area always displayed as decimal in js
[02:10:08] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY-, I can look at it in just a couple minutes.
[02:10:21] <Cork> ?eval var hex = (7551052).toString(16); hex
[02:10:22] <bot-t> Cork: "73384c"
[02:10:30] <Cork> ?eval var hex = (7551052).toString(16); parseInt(hex, 16)
[02:10:30] <bot-t> Cork: 7551052
[02:10:34] <shoky> Cork yea but you usually have the color css as a string, not a number
[02:10:56] <Cork> shoky: where did you get it from?
[02:11:09] <shoky> the string?
[02:11:13] <Cork> the number
[02:11:22] <shoky> heh what?
[02:11:25] <shoky> from Whirl3d ?
[02:11:30] <Cork> ah, sorry
[02:11:48] <Cork> thats prob from a server or something
[02:12:04] <shoky> hmm oks
[02:12:16] <Cork> and ya, css normally express it in rgb or rgba
[02:12:25] <Cork> except for ie, as normal :/
[02:12:54] <shoky> at least its being normal ;s
[02:13:20] <Cork> ya, its normal that they always does things differently, so you have to hack things for them -_-
[02:15:58] <shoky> hrm. maybe i'll actually go to work today. hmmmmmmmmm
[02:19:01] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Thanks!
[02:19:26] <fRAiLtY-> I'm just unsure as to how to link it in with what I've got, I thought I'd start by separating the functions out into a separate JS file but that killed the page lol
[02:23:57] <Whirl3d> so the toString(16) didn't work. I'll try the next one.
[02:28:36] <Whirl3d> YEAH! That worked. Now just a dozen more little bugs to fix LOL.
[02:29:21] <Cork> Whirl3d: what happend when you used the first one?
[02:29:32] <Cork> as long as what you have isn't a string it should work fine
[02:29:43] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Just for reference rather then view source, here's my code :x
[02:29:44] <fRAiLtY-> http://pastie.org/4147441
[02:30:00] <Whirl3d> i dunno. it stayed black. Here is the link to the ROUGH draft. Click on Birds. to see the effect: http://www.paigeharvey.net/gallery/main-6.html
[02:31:09] <shoky> hmm
[02:31:14] <fRAiLtY-> I'm thinking all the query could go in one block too
[02:31:31] <shoky> Whirl3d i get lots of different tooltips when i move my mouse around
[02:31:44] <shoky> oh nvm
[02:31:54] <Whirl3d> lol, I know it's all messed up with the title attributes
[02:32:36] <Cork> damn that background is slow
[02:32:48] <Whirl3d> it's supposed to be subtle
[02:33:00] <Cork> i meant slow in loading
[02:33:09] <Cork> the first white one
[02:33:21] <Whirl3d> I haven't down-sampled it. THey are just rough pngs 24bit
[02:33:37] <Cork> Whirl3d: and yes your sending a string
[02:33:47] <Cork> so you would have to parse it for the first one to work
[02:34:08] <Cork> ?eval parseInt("10969946", 10).toString(16)
[02:34:09] <bot-t> Cork: "a7635a"
[02:34:09] <Whirl3d> eventually they will be 8 bit and optimized. I was just trying to get the sql stuff working and the bg color stuff working. I see what you mean about the color. oops.
[02:34:40] <Cork> ?eval "10969946".toString(16)
[02:34:40] <bot-t> Cork: "10969946"
[02:34:42] <Cork> :)
[02:35:54] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Tidied it a bit http://pastie.org/4147441
[02:36:11] <shoky> is Math.floor(x) exactly the same as x>>0 ?
[02:36:51] <Cork> shoky: no
[02:36:52] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY- wrap all of your code in a $(document).ready(function () {   your code });
[02:36:56] <shoky> hm >>0 doesn't give NaN
[02:37:41] <Cork> ?eval Math.floor(99999999999999.99)
[02:37:42] <bot-t> Cork: 99999999999999
[02:37:54] <Cork> ?eval 99999999999999.99 >> 0
[02:37:54] <bot-t> Cork: 276447231
[02:38:05] <Cork> quite a bit of difference :)
[02:38:20] <shoky> i see
[02:38:27] <Cork> >> << is 32bit
[02:38:36] <shoky> yea, didnt think of that
[02:38:37] <Cork> same with  & | and so on
[02:38:49] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  It is, line 4 http://pastie.org/4147441
[02:39:31] <Whirl3d> but that's the part you are pulling out into an external file and loading in the document header
[02:40:01] <dagerik> Sometimes in my jquery ready() function, other libs such as backbone are not ready loaded. What causes this?
[02:40:39] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  Will the php echo's work in an external file?
[02:41:41] <shoky> dagerik: i don't know backbone.. but jquery ready() doesn't mean that all your scripts have finished doing their thing.. just means the DOM structure is ready
[02:42:05] <jonno11> hmm I've got a hidden element which I'm populating with an image - I need to get the width of the element before .show()'ing it. width() is returning 0… any ideas?
[02:43:25] <shoky> jonno11: dont actually hide it.. put it on opacity:0 or smth
[02:44:07] <Whirl3d> Hold on one second....did you get it working without moving the jquery to an external file?
[02:44:32] <jonno11> I would, but it's covering the screen. I might use pointer-events: none; but I was more wondering why width() was returning 0...
[02:45:04] <shoky> pointer-events: none  doesnt work on all browsers i think
[02:45:08] <jonno11> yeah
[02:45:18] <jonno11> hence why I want another alternative...
[02:45:18] <jworboys> pointer-events: none doesn't work in Opera
[02:45:19] <shoky> it's returning 0 because that's the width..
[02:45:39] <jworboys> you could self position: absolute and left: -99999px?
[02:45:44] <jonno11> so width only comes into play when the element's displayed...
[02:45:58] <shoky> naturally
[02:46:15] <shoky> why would the browser need to calculate the width if the element is not there
[02:46:29] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  No, not yet, shall I keep it in one file first? I can't suss where to put them functions and link it all up :x
[02:46:39] <shoky> and yea, moving it offscreen could help
[02:46:42] <jonno11> well not naturally, it's not that the element doesn't exist, it's that it isn't being displayed to the user
[02:46:53] <jonno11> it still exists
[02:46:55] <shoky> it doesn't exist in the view
[02:47:03] <shoky> it doesn't have a width
[02:47:12] <shoky> it exists as an object in memory
[02:47:29] <shoky> the width is calculated when it needs to be
[02:47:30] <jonno11> exactly… so all the width etc. is generated on display: block?
[02:47:50] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY-, I'd just get it working however you can...then worry about moving stuff around..
[02:47:50] <shoky> it's generated when the browser decides that it is neccessary to calculate..
[02:47:54] <jworboys> it exists in the DOM but it isn't considered when the browser calculates the layout so it isn't given any dimensional properties
[02:48:10] <jonno11> ok. what about visibility: hidden?
[02:48:11] <Whirl3d> otherwise there are too many variables and you'll end up like me: unable to actually get anything done. LOL
[02:48:35] <shoky> jonno11: moving it offscreen is probably best
[02:48:53] <jonno11> ok will do
[02:48:54] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  OK, so here http://pastie.org/4147441 if I put them functions from your fiddle after the initial document.ready?
[02:49:00] <jworboys> visibility: hidden the element exists in the layout so other elements are moved around or covered by it. It has a similar effect to using opacity: 0
[02:49:24] <jonno11> can you click through the element?
[02:49:29] <jworboys> no
[02:49:37] <fRAiLtY-> And is there any reason why afterAjax is outside of the document ready?
[02:50:05] <jonno11> fixed -99999px it is then
[02:50:34] <jworboys> I would use absolute. Fixed has issues on mobile
[02:50:47] <jworboys> From memory
[02:51:02] <Cork> "issues"
[02:51:10] <Cork> lol thats the understatement of the day XD
[02:51:29] <shoky> heh, what happens?
[02:51:39] <Cork> what doesn't happen?
[02:51:44] <shoky> i wouldn't know
[02:51:48] <Cork> its completly unusably broken
[02:52:01] <jworboys> I has issues rendering and makes scroll jerky
[02:52:01] <shoky> neat :D
[02:52:08] <jworboys> *It
[02:52:11] <Cork> google it, theres tons of pages testing it
[02:52:21] <shoky> will do
[02:52:33] <Cork> jworboys: some browsers break completely
[02:52:44] <Cork> where you can't click on some elements
[02:52:55] <Cork> or the element gets stuck after a while
[02:52:55] <jworboys> Cork: I suppose that may be an issue as well :p
[02:52:57] <Cork> and so on
[02:53:25] <Cork> the list i checked a few days ago was like 15+ different issues in different browsers
[02:53:36] <Cork> the best browser for position: fixed elements was...
[02:54:03] <Cork> the amazone one ( the name has escaped me)
[02:54:10] <Cork> right, kindle
[02:54:30] <Cork> it was the only mobile browser without fixed issues >_<
[02:55:10] <blackspotwiggins> kindle fire?
[02:55:12] <Cork> yes
[02:55:27] <Cork> and yes, thats a sucky browser, but it won the test >_<
[02:56:01] <Cork> that shows how bad the mobile market is for old simple css rules
[02:56:37] <shoky> i am so happy with my 2005~ nokia
[02:56:41] <Cork> the jerkiness, i would say is totally fine, its all the other bugs thats a show stopper
[02:56:42] <shoky> barely has a cam
[02:56:55] <shoky> i dont have the web with me wherever i go. its awesome
[02:57:23] <Cork> lol
[02:58:38] <shoky> up until 3 years ago i still used my first ever cellphone, motorola timeport :D
[03:03:14] <jonno11> OK still not working
[03:03:26] <jonno11> I tried to go opacity: 0
[03:04:29] <jonno11> still no width
[03:04:29] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  http://pastie.org/4147441 I'm getting Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLSelectElement> has no method 'find'  when I select a drop-down :x
[03:04:35] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[03:07:20] <junkqwe2> What is the best way to do this:
[03:07:22] <junkqwe2> $("a[href$='.PLT'], a[href$='.plt'], a[href$='.DWG'], a[href$='.dwg']")
[03:11:13] <ravenzz> $('a').filter(function(){ return /\.(dwg|plt)$/i.test($(this).attr('href'))  });
[03:11:25] <ravenzz> but i don't know whether it is faster or not
[03:13:17] <EdwardIII> hey
[03:13:36] <EdwardIII> is there a way i can quickly stop all jquery styling of just 1 element accordion?
[03:13:44] <fRAiLtY-> Hmm anyone know why I'm getting Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLSelectElement> has no method 'find' here: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing click the drop-down to see
[03:13:46] <EdwardIII> i want to keep jquery ui styles for everything else, just not the accordion
[03:14:02] <EdwardIII> fRAiLtY-: forgetting to wrap your non-jQuery elem in $(myElem)?
[03:14:42] <fRAiLtY-> EdwardIII:  Which element are you referring too?
[03:15:18] <xec> fRAiLtY-: i think he means the entire accordion
[03:15:36] <xec> fRAiLtY-: like, he wants to keep css styles for other modules (not elements)
[03:15:38] <EdwardIII> fRAiLtY-: the HTMLSelectElement in the error?
[03:15:50] <EdwardIII> xec: yeah, that's what i want heh
[03:16:10] <xec> oh, he wasnt trying to answer your question lol, nevermind
[03:16:22] <EdwardIII> xec: can't figure out a way of doing it. figure i need to change the css of all elements in the accordian, but can't see a rapid way to do that
[03:16:47] <xec> EdwardIII: well, will it even work properly without css?
[03:17:14] <EdwardIII> xec: yeah, got an accordian made with another jquery lib
[03:17:21] <EdwardIII> just trying to switch it out to UI
[03:18:26] <fRAiLtY-> Sorry, I'm really confused, why do I have to wrap my drop-downs in jQuery?
[03:18:44] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/ajjublr/TTTLw/126/ how to target the length of li inside ul of div tabs ?
[03:19:16] <xec> fRAiLtY-: it seems you're trying to call the jQuery method "find" on a native DOM object
[03:19:34] <fRAiLtY-> Hi xec, it's a drop-down
[03:19:36] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[03:19:40] <fRAiLtY-> 1 and 2
[03:19:56] <fRAiLtY-> It worked before but Whirl3d  has been helping me and something I've done has caused this
[03:20:00] <xec> fRAiLtY-: yes, a HTML select element, by the looks of things?
[03:20:05] <fRAiLtY-> xec:  Yes
[03:20:13] <fRAiLtY-> I never had these "wrapped" in anything before
[03:20:16] <Nece228> hello
[03:20:18] <fRAiLtY-> just a little bit confused :x
[03:20:24] <xec> fRAiLtY-: okay, what is the .find() supposed to do? where does the error come from?
[03:20:27] <Nece228> fadeOut() does hide the element of html right?
[03:20:33] <Nece228> well how to remove it, not hide
[03:21:53] <fRAiLtY-> xec:  The find as I see it is supposed to highlight the column (css col-selected) for select 1 and for select 2 highlight the row (css row-selected). Now, The problem I had before was that the highlighting worked fine but select 3 is an ajax request, once the ajax returned results the highlighting would disappear
[03:23:24] <junkqwe2> ravenzz tnx
[03:23:28] <junkqwe2> ill try it
[03:23:43] <Nece228> heh .remove() works
[03:23:56] <fRAiLtY-> xec:  Scratch that, I've figured it. I have $this instead if jQuery(this)
[03:23:56] <Nece228> but how to apply fadeout animation to remove?
[03:24:14] <fRAiLtY-> One more issue, now the col doesn't highlight. It doesn't apply the col-selected class to the column
[03:24:44] <xec> fRAiLtY-: from the looks of things, you have *just* gotten that issue, right?
[03:24:55] <xec> fRAiLtY-: maybe give it a go yourself first? ;)
[03:24:55] <fRAiLtY-> Yep, just this sec
[03:25:06] <yotam> Nece228: .fadeOut('slow', function() { $(this).remove(); });
[03:25:37] <Nece228> yotam: oh, thanks!
[03:25:47] <ravenzz> junkqwe2 using the i flag you don't need to have both the upper and lower case extension
[03:25:59] <yotam> np
[03:26:02] <EdwardIII> hrm, any way i can hook into .accordion() so i can run a function when it's complete
[03:27:36] <xec> EdwardIII: when what is complete? the create or a change?
[03:27:47] <xec> EdwardIII: in either case, yes ;)
[03:27:59] <fRAiLtY-> xec:  I had this before and it was css related, it doesn't appear to be this time as the cols aren't having "col-selected" appended to them, so it's js. However Chrome console doesn't give me any errors :x
[03:28:55] <LordThumper> Hey. Is there any way for an iframe to notify the parent page? (for example when it has finished running some script)
[03:29:10] <LordThumper> Same domain, but not same subdomain
[03:29:43] <blackspotwiggins> LordThumper, set document.domain to same value on both frames, call window.parent.somefunction from iframe
[03:30:00] <blackspotwiggins> or postMessage, if available
[03:32:32] <fRAiLtY-> xec: I've tried alert on the 2 selects and they both alert object Object, which I assume is correct, I can't see why one works and one doesn't :x
[03:33:10] <xec> fRAiLtY-: why assume with alert, when you can know with console.log ?
[03:35:36] <fRAiLtY-> xec:  Cool, so they both return the correct index numbers, highlightcol returns "3", except it doesn't highlight col3. highlight row returns 6, and highlights row 6....
[03:35:40] <LordThumper> blackspotwiggins: In chrome I am getting a security error when I try to change document.domain
[03:35:42] <fRAiLtY-> There' like the same code
[03:36:59] <Whirl3d> fRAiLtY-, you understand that you can apply one class to the row and the entire row is highlighted or selected or what have you. But you can't do that with a column
[03:37:20] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  It worked before?
[03:37:29] <Whirl3d> columns are just visual in a table... you have to select every 3rd td in every row to get the column to highlight
[03:37:35] <Whirl3d> hence the use of .find
[03:37:53] <fRAiLtY-> I have my cols setup as col1, col2, col3 dynamically, is this not suitable?
[03:38:18] <fRAiLtY-> Soz, just at the minute I'm going backwards1
[03:38:19] <fRAiLtY-> !
[03:39:02] <Whirl3d> when we looked at you code before there was nothing distinguishing the columns to select directly...if you have all the td's in column 1 set to col1 then yes it'll work
[03:39:39] <fRAiLtY-> But that's what I want it to do, select the column and the row.
[03:40:18] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  And rather frustratingly it all disappears upon AJAX :/
[03:41:25] <fRAiLtY-> It's just annoying as I had all this working before, the highlighting etc and it just disappeared on AJAX, now I've gone backwards :x
[03:42:16] <Whirl3d> okay. let's look at the function I wrote for you step by step. If you notice the HighlightColumn code finds all of the td's (which make up a column) that are the nth number column
[03:42:38] <fRAiLtY-> Yep I see
[03:42:54] <Whirl3d> currently you don't have any way to identify them other than to select the td's for each row
[03:43:19] <fRAiLtY-> They're all called col1 etc?
[03:43:19] <skcin7> What percentage of users would you guys say have JavaScript disabled? Is it even worth it nowadays to write a web application that works with form submissions as a backup in case JavaScript is disabled?
[03:43:29] <Whirl3d> maybe you could preprocess your table to apply column ids and then reprocess when ajax is done
[03:44:46] <skcin7> Nevermind, I found the percentage, which is apparently around 2.06 percent according to somebody who posted on SitePoint.
[03:44:56] <Whirl3d> so why did you number the columns and not the rows? just out of curiosity?
[03:45:47] <yotam> table.find('tr.selected') maybe this should be table.find('tr.row-selected')?
[03:46:10] <yotam> just guessing
[03:47:01] <Whirl3d> I forgot you have inline code above lol wow
[03:50:43] <anew> if u guys are using break on attributes modification... does that only work for div changes?  for example i'm trying to click on a button and i'm not breaking
[03:52:55] <shoky> anew: clicking doesn't modify any attributes
[03:53:34] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  Makes no difference :x
[03:53:39] <yotam> fa
[03:53:52] <yotam> fRAiLtY-: try removing the console writing
[03:53:56] <fRAiLtY-> fa?
[03:54:18] <anew> shoky so how would you set a breakpoint on a click like you do with attributes modifications?
[03:54:44] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  Nope, nada.
[03:54:47] <yotam> oh wait dont do that
[03:54:48] <X-Raimo> hello can you help me with cross-domain problem. The problem is: http://picpaste.com/untitled_page-ogj4XeBt.png First part works great, second gives an error
[03:54:48] <yotam> :D
[03:54:53] <fRAiLtY-> No column selected :xx
[03:55:02] <iLogic> how do i get only the contents of a specific div via $.ajax .. apparently i can't do like the shorthand $('#target').load('page.html #div');
[03:55:16] <shoky> anew: i'd set up a new click handler for that element and put a breakpoint inside it
[03:56:01] <shoky> anew: what do you mean by breakpoint on click?  a click is a user event, not something that your code does
[03:56:13] <shoky> anew: where do you want the debugger to break? on the user's finger?
[03:56:18] <anew> shoky can i pm you and just show you the code ?
[03:56:21] <yotam> fRAiLtY-: table.find('tr').find('td').eq(
[03:56:28] <shoky> anew pastebin it if you want
[03:56:33] <yotam> without the selcted
[03:56:34] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/g58J6/12
[03:57:14] <yotam> fRAiLtY-: maybe even like this table.find('td').eq(
[03:57:21] <Whirl3d> frailty, now that the columns are numbered, you can select them easily. The thing you are having a problem with is that you need to store that info somewhere that Doesn't get rewritted after the ajax call
[03:57:49] <Whirl3d> so find a parent element that doesn't get written over to store your row and col highlighed then after ajax just look it up and reapply
[03:58:09] <Whirl3d> rewritten*
[03:58:11] <fRAiLtY-> yotam, selects 1 td (the top one) not everyone in the column
[03:58:22] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  So an object like the div?
[03:58:26] <fRAiLtY-> that's not overwritten
[03:58:44] <yotam> you can just take the selcted value of the select you are using
[03:59:02] <jetienne> q. im inside a file.js which is executed with a <script src=""> ... how can i know the url of the file.js script from inside file.js ? not sure to be clear
[04:00:26] <yotam> fRAiLtY-: table.find('.col' + num)
[04:02:05] <yotam> nvm i see Whirl3d's code is working  good
[04:03:20] <jds> Heya
[04:05:07] <fRAiLtY-> lol Whirl3d  it works but selects the top td on the next column too lol :D
[04:05:19] <fRAiLtY-> Looks funny hehe
[04:05:39] <jds> Say I'm loading excanvas into IE8 with something like "yepnope({load:'ielt9!excanvas.js'})".  Elsewhere in my application, I'm checking if (Modernizr.canvas){ doPrettyStuff() }.  Modernizr.canvas is still false, so the excanvas shim gets ignored.
[04:05:52] <jds> Obviously I could manually set Modernizr.canvas=true after loading excanvas
[04:06:07] <jds> but I'm wondering if there's an official way of dealing with that sort of stuff
[04:07:08] <yotam> fRAiLtY-: you probably should make two classes, one for selected td and one for selected tr
[04:08:05] <yotam> so removeClass will work better
[04:09:03] <fRAiLtY-> Is that why it's selecting an additional td though?
[04:10:25] <yotam> that doesnt happen for me
[04:12:45] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  If I select "Wideboy" http://i50.tinypic.com/172qz7.png
[04:12:54] <fRAiLtY-> and anything else it selects the row and the td beside it :x
[04:13:25] <yotam> can you post the url again
[04:13:32] <fRAiLtY-> http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[04:13:37] <fRAiLtY-> Select 1 causes it
[04:13:43] <fRAiLtY-> Select 2 appears fine
[04:14:27] <iLogic> anybody experienced in ajax requests here?
[04:14:46] <iLogic> i'm having trouble with a slideshow plugin after loading it with ajax
[04:18:13] <Cork> ?ask @ iLogic
[04:18:16] <bot-t> iLogic, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:18:39] <yotam> fRAiLtY- try my code table.find('.col-selected').removeClass('col-selected'); table.find('col' + num).addClass('col-selected');
[04:19:05] <yotam> fRAiLtY- try my code table.find('.col-selected').removeClass('col-selected'); table.find('.col' + num).addClass('col-selected');
[04:21:10] <anew> anyone have a way to find out all the functions associated with a click event ?
[04:21:30] <iLogic> http://eutopia.com.br I'm successfully loading the slideshow plugin after the ajax $load() for the Portfolio menu item, but if I click another item and go back to Portfolio a couple of time, you can see it breaks (apparently the function keeps getting called)
[04:21:42] <Cork> anew: you mean all callbacks bound to an elements click?
[04:22:49] <anew> i mean when i do break on attributes modification i can see in the stack trace all the functions associated with a change in attribute.... a button does not have that change, so how can i do effectively the same thing when i click a button ?
[04:22:56] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  Right, works. So I'm back where I started, now how to stop this disappearing when drop-downs 3 an 4 (ajax) are called
[04:23:20] <anew> cork
[04:23:28] <iLogic> is there a way to stop the function from running?
[04:23:30] <yotam> hehe
[04:23:56] <yotam> when you get the callback from ajax call the function again
[04:24:23] <fRAiLtY-> for example: jQuery.ajax({
[04:24:23] <fRAiLtY-> 									url:'/matrix/ajax/update/product/'+productId+'/stock/'+jQuery(this).find('option:selected').text()+def+attributeSet,
[04:24:23] <fRAiLtY-> 									success:function(result){ jQuery('#matrix-container').html(result); }
[04:24:23] <fRAiLtY-> 								});
[04:24:25] <Cork> anew: what functions are you talking about?
[04:24:31] <Cork> ? @ fRAiLtY-
[04:24:33] <bot-t> fRAiLtY-, jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library - http://jquery.com/
[04:24:33] <Cork> ?p @ fRAiLtY-
[04:24:34] <bot-t> fRAiLtY-, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:24:43] <yotam> and get the selected col & row number from the <select> element
[04:24:51] <anew> cork can i show you
[04:24:57] <fRAiLtY-> yotam, that's what partVal is
[04:25:21] <yotam> ?
[04:25:38] <fRAiLtY-> Do I call the function again in the success: part?
[04:25:51] <yotam> yes after you set the html
[04:26:37] <yotam> the same code you have in the onChange
[04:27:37] <yotam> you can also invoke the change event but thats not really necessary, just copy the code
[04:30:21] <fRAiLtY-> Hmmm Whirl3d  did an afterAjax() function, what does that do?
[04:30:45] <yotam> where?
[04:32:00] <yotam> you can call the function and put the functionality you have in the change event there
[04:32:15] <yotam> that function*
[04:32:16] <fRAiLtY-> http://pastie.org/4147893
[04:32:19] <fRAiLtY-> Line 19
[04:32:23] <fRAiLtY-> it already has stuff in it
[04:33:31] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  ?
[04:34:19] <yotam> try replacing it with
[04:34:23] <yotam> highlightRow(jQuery('#product-options-wrapper').find('select').eq(1).find("option:selected").index());
[04:34:36] <yotam> highlightCol(jQuery('#product-options-wrapper').find('select').eq(0).find("option:selected").index());
[04:35:39] <anew> is the only way to see a click event is with an event listener breakpoint?  can i not select the element and set a break point that way ?
[04:36:35] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  Nope :x am I calling it right in the success? I've just done afterAjax()
[04:37:12] <fRAiLtY-> success:function(result){ jQuery('#matrix-container').html(result); afterAjax(); }
[04:39:53] <yotam> fRAiLtY- try adding this row in the begining of afterAjax
[04:39:56] <yotam> var table = jQuery('#matrix-container table');
[04:40:02] <yotam> without the var
[04:41:06] <fRAiLtY-> without var?
[04:42:32] <fRAiLtY-> works.. oddly :o
[04:42:33] <fRAiLtY-> :D
[04:42:42] <yotam> :D
[04:42:57] <yotam> you already have that var declared in a higher scope
[04:43:42] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  I have, however hit a snag… it works on the row index right? i.e. 6. So for example one of those ajax requests returns a short table. Even though the configuration 10000xa6 is there, it's not at row 6 anymore… :
[04:43:43] <fRAiLtY-> :x
[04:44:01] <fRAiLtY-> Try selecting 10000, CD, 400gsm Matt and see what I mean
[04:44:30] <fRAiLtY-> It needs to work on the text identifier I think rather than the index, what do you think?
[04:45:41] <fRAiLtY-> The column should always be right…. just the row :x
[04:46:03] <yotam> sec
[04:47:41] <cusco> woa! big channel
[04:47:43] <cusco> hello !
[04:48:03] <yotam> yeah index is not good if the table changes
[04:48:46] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  Think I need to change it, can it pick up the text value and work from that? As the quantity (10000) in the example is still there, just the lesser qty's removed
[04:48:58] <cusco> I'm looking for some nice gui to manage email lists. So I would like to have a list of addresses, and be able to move them to the list, or remove them from the list
[04:49:01] <yotam> maybe if you give each tr an id with the value of the size (tr id="25")
[04:49:08] <cusco> like --> add, or <-- remove
[04:49:17] <cusco> what would you suggest?
[05:03:26] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  Result, I've got the th's down the side in green to be ID's of the quantity, i.e. the 250 row is id="250" where can i incorporate this into the script as oppose to indices ?
[05:04:58] <KampfFussel> hello @ all
[05:05:29] <yotam> fRAiLtY-; in the highltrow code
[05:05:38] <yotam> just one sec
[05:05:41] <fRAiLtY-> kk
[05:05:48] <yotam> let me see what you did
[05:06:36] <KampfFussel> can someone tell me if .on('change' ..... will work with IE8 ?
[05:06:40] <yotam> okay to the highlight row you should pass not the index but the value
[05:07:05] <yotam> and in the function do these changes
[05:07:14] <yotam> table.find('.row-selected').removeClass('row-selected');
[05:07:38] <yotam> table.find('#' + num).parent().addClass('row-selected')
[05:07:52] <wathek> Hi everybody
[05:08:05] <wathek> is there a way to create a scrollable area with jquery
[05:08:55] <yotam> so pass: val.val() instead of val.index()
[05:09:47] <fRAiLtY-> table.parent().data('row',num); ?
[05:09:47] <fRAiLtY-> Actually, var partVal = val.index();
[05:09:47] <fRAiLtY-> That passes the index to the function
[05:09:47] <fRAiLtY-> so it should be val.value() ?
[05:10:43] <Whirl3d> yotam, the reason we went with indeces rather than ids is that when he reloads the table, it may have different values for the ids and the selectors would be useless at that point. Things may have changed, but we decided that using indeces would give us a more flexible approach.
[05:12:14] <fRAiLtY-> Whirl3d:  It's my fault
[05:12:19] <fRAiLtY-> I didn't think about the "short" table
[05:12:43] <yotam> Whirl3d: what happend was that after the reload of the table the first rows were removed so the highlted row was different than the selcted value
[05:13:33] <yotam> the first row was 1000 and not 25 so if i selected before 25  and then the table reloaded, 1000 was now selected
[05:13:42] <yotam> ids would solve this
[05:14:08] <yotam> fRAiLtY-: not val.val() but val.html()
[05:17:04] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  Did you see my last msg before d/c ?
[05:20:00] <yotam> no
[05:20:24] <yotam> mine was  fRAiLtY-: not val.val() but val.html()
[05:21:38] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  console.log still shows that val.val() is returning an integer?
[05:21:49] <DarsVaeda1> how can I insert something after a div '<div id="foo"></div>INSERTHERE', I tried .after()/.insertAfter() but that inserts into the div
[05:23:58] <yotam> use val.html()
[05:25:34] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  both .text and .html work, but then the highlight doesn't happen, but it console.logs the correct thing
[05:26:16] <fRAiLtY-> I tried .text as you said .html
[05:26:29] <fRAiLtY-> both return strings of numbers, i.e. 500, 1000 etc but don't highlight
[05:28:23] <RAMPKORV> I don't know if this is the correct forum, but I have a menu div that I want to remain as it is when the user is zooming in on his ipad, as is done on this page for example http://codelib.hpublication.com/publication/abd160ee/mobile/
[05:28:30] <RAMPKORV> Is there a simple solution?
[05:29:15] <laszlof> what do you mean, "remain as it is"
[05:29:28] <laszlof> you mean resize the menu when they zoom
[05:29:33] <laszlof> so it stays on the page
[05:30:06] <bindi> give me some advice here, I have something that grabs comments every 5 sec (50 bytes/sec!), and I wish to initially just show them, but when I retrieve new comments, I want to append them with an animation
[05:30:28] <bindi> actually I think I just got it lol, I'll just set the css to hidden after I've loaded the comments first
[05:30:52] <bindi> wait, can I do that?
[05:31:26] <yotam> fRAiLtY- did you change the code in the highlight row function?
[05:31:36] <fRAiLtY-> Yea, sec
[05:32:00] <fRAiLtY-> 								table.find('.row-selected').removeClass('row-selected'); table.find('#' + num).parent().addClass('row-selected'); table.parent().data('row',num);
[05:32:48] <soee> if i have some url on my page can i redirect to destination page using POST to send url parameters?
[05:33:39] <ablomen> soee, you could submit a form.. but why not use get?
[05:33:50] <yotam> fRAiLtY- you need to remove the check for number
[05:34:14] <soee> ablomen, because i wan't to send record id to remove and i wan't post here
[05:34:17] <yotam> remove this line: if (typeof num!=='number') return;
[05:35:47] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  gotcha, nearly there now!!!!! it loses the row on AJAX but not the col
[05:36:21] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  That's in afterAjax, does any of that need changing: highlightCol(jQuery('#product-options-wrapper').find('select').eq(0).find("option:selected").index());
[05:36:26] <yotam> in the after ajax code replace the .index() to .text()
[05:40:18] <bindi> how can I make this not affect "#comment_' + yo?
[05:40:24] <bindi> $('.vastauslomake').not('#comment_' + yo).hide('slow');
[05:40:33] <bindi> might be doing this wrong
[05:40:34] <fRAiLtY-> yotam:  thanks, it works :D
[05:41:19] <bindi> ah, got it, was missing something from the .not
[05:41:52] <yotam> great
[05:45:32] <phryk> Hi there. I'm currently trying to make tooltips work for me, using this plugin: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Tooltip
[05:45:54] <phryk> Problem being that in my minimal example it works fine, while in my actual use case the tooltip doesn't show up *at all*
[05:46:12] <phryk> The bodyHandler callback is called but, that much I can say for sure, but the tooltip just doesn't show.
[05:46:33] <RohanBhangui> what is the differnece between $(".test>a") and $(".test a")
[05:46:54] <_trev> the latter selects all anchors within the test element
[05:47:02] <phryk> .test > a only selects a elements that are directly within .test
[05:47:17] <phryk> while ".test a" also selects a elements that are in childelements of .test
[05:47:23] <_trev> phryk, beat me to the other one :P
[05:47:25] <RohanBhangui> okay thx
[05:47:27] <RohanBhangui>  guys
[05:47:30] <RohanBhangui> lol
[05:47:31] <phryk> ^_^
[05:48:00] <phryk> _trev: Well maybe you can also help my with my little tooltip troubles?
[05:49:53] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/CXjeX/
[05:50:03] <RohanBhangui> how would i find out which of the elements is clicked
[05:50:32] <RohanBhangui> so what i want to do
[05:50:44] <RohanBhangui> is when you click rohan all elements span out
[05:50:58] <RohanBhangui> all those elements have the same class (header)
[05:51:13] <RohanBhangui> how do i find out which one is clicked and then reverse the animation for all others
[05:53:33] <nFFF> e.target is the one that will be clicked
[05:54:08] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/CXjeX/1/
[05:54:16] <seutje> http://pastebin.com/hQWvqGWB <- this is bad, right?
[05:54:27] <Zavior> : I'm loading a partial view inside a query dialog. I have a search function inside that view that I want to refresh the list of customers I'm looking at. Unfortunately the partial view it returns overwrites the entire page instead of just updating the dialog window. Any ideas or suggestions? MVC3
[05:55:59] <Zavior> I think this might be an MVC3 question and less of query maybe?
[05:57:23] <RohanBhangui> thx nFFF
[05:57:53] <RohanBhangui> but how would i reverse the animation and prevent the clicked element from animating?
[05:59:03] <_trev> RohanBhangui, bind click events to the element, and use siblings() to animate the siblings
[05:59:32] <RohanBhangui> sry have no clue what that
[05:59:36] <RohanBhangui> is just started jquery
[05:59:45] <RohanBhangui> like 2-3 weeks ago
[05:59:53] <RohanBhangui> could you show me
[05:59:58] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/CXjeX/1/
[06:08:38] <vmassuchetto> Why I'm able to see an object's attribute in console.log, but an alert() gives me 'undefined'?
[06:09:20] <vmassuchetto> Not exactly a jQuery issue, maybe.
[06:09:24] <codeAssassin> RohanBhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/GeucU/2/
[06:09:38] <vlad27aug> vmassuchetto: because the alert executes immediately...while console.log needs to be executed in a closure to see exactly what is in that variable at the moment of code execution
[06:11:07] <vmassuchetto> vlad27aug, Ok. I need the variable anyway in that moment. Is there anything special to do? (maybe a very wide question)
[06:12:15] <vlad27aug> if you get undefined for the alert than it is clear that the variable isn't populated at the time of that code executes
[06:12:35] <vlad27aug> you have some asynchronous code that doesn't execute when you want it
[06:14:56] <QueueQueue> @vmassuchetto A jsfiddle may provide more context for people to help with.
[06:24:31] <RohanBhangui> anyway to select direct parent of a div?
[06:24:41] <RohanBhangui> i know you can do div>a
[06:24:45] <RohanBhangui> for direct children
[06:24:52] <RohanBhangui> an ideas for other way around
[06:25:01] <RohanBhangui> using .parent
[06:26:34] <xec> RohanBhangui: why do you need to avoid .parent() ?
[06:26:48] <RohanBhangui> no sry
[06:26:52] <xec> or did i misunderstand
[06:27:01] <FJ1> I need some help. http://jsfiddle.net/DNtHn/2/ if you drag you get an error "cur is null" (jquery-git.js (Zeile 5447)) - has somebody an idea?
[06:27:12] <RohanBhangui> cause my parent is the direct parent and the parent my change many times
[06:27:20] <RohanBhangui> *may
[06:27:50] <RohanBhangui> its like this
[06:27:53] <xec> RohanBhangui: "parent" is always direct, maybe you mean "ancestor"? what is your use case
[06:27:59] <RohanBhangui> i clcik a div and it reveals other divs
[06:28:11] <RohanBhangui> okay let me setup fiddle
[06:29:33] <RohanBhangui> nvm
[06:29:41] <RohanBhangui> i forgot what i was planning to do
[06:29:47] <RohanBhangui> ill let you know if it comes to mind again
[06:29:51] <shoky> FJ1: http://jsfiddle.net/DNtHn/3/
[06:29:54] <jonno11> I'm dynamically loading an image into a div, currently using .html('<img src="foo" />'); but I need a way to load that image and fire a callback when it's loaded. Any ideas?
[06:30:41] <shoky> jonno11:  var img = new Image(); $(img).load( yourCallback ); img.src="foo";
[06:30:42] <fuchstronaut> (jonno11): $.ajax has callbacks (success, error, ...) you can fire
[06:31:01] <jonno11> shoky: good call sir, will do
[06:31:46] <FJ1> @shokey. yes. with jquery 1.72 and jQuery UI 1.8.18 it works.
[06:31:56] <shoky> FJ1: yes, so what's the prob ;)
[06:32:53] <shoky> pretty sure it'd work with 1.8.21 too
[06:32:56] <FJ1> it looks like a core bug in jquery 1.8
[06:32:57] <xec> FJ1: have a look at the source at http://jsfiddle.net/DNtHn/2/show/ (your demo) -- it's calling the code before you include the ui script
[06:33:18] <xec> FJ1: the bug is on your part
[06:33:43] <shoky> and if you want to find a bug in a non stable jquery, go for 1.8b1 , not the latest git build..
[06:34:22] <FJ1> @xec how can i "switch" it within jsfiddle?
[06:35:31] <FJ1> @shoky i found it when i used 1.8b1 - thats why i build this jsfiddle
[06:37:52] <FJ1> @xec http://jsfiddle.net/DNtHn/8/ same problem
[06:37:57] <xec> FJ1: you can add all the required scripts in the html manually, or under resources, and use no wrap (body) to get the js field to be at the bottom
[06:39:53] <shoky> it's not a core bug if it only happens when you use jquery ui..
[06:40:37] <xec> oh yes, i see what you mean now
[06:40:43] <FJ1> can i report hat somewhere?
[06:42:05] <shoky> jqui 1.8.21 supports jquery 1.7.2
[06:42:22] <shoky> nobody said anywhere that it supports jquery 1.8+
[06:42:23] <xec> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ probably, although i'm not sure if they want reports on the latest build
[06:42:44] <shoky> i dont see what there is to report
[06:49:36] <Zavior> Does anyone have any tips for updating a partial view (MVC3) from a jquery dialog?
[06:50:52] <Zavior> I see tons of examples about loading a partial view into a dialog, yet I can't find any of updating a partial view on the main screen from the dialog
[06:54:26] <donnaR> hey jq how can I get the binary data of a video to a var?
[06:55:52] <mongoob> $(this).parent().parent().find(':checkbox').attr('id')
[06:55:55] <mongoob> this is good or stupid code?
[06:59:47] <chilversc_> is it possible to control the formatting in chrome's developer tools?
[06:59:59] <chilversc_> rather than just seeing; 3: Object
[07:02:56] <Jon47> mongoob: looks pretty unreliable, what if the markup changes
[07:04:30] <mongoob> Jon47: whats a better alternative?
[07:08:59] <tocka> hey
[07:09:07] <tocka> I have this post function i ajax
[07:09:09] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/ijiccvZL
[07:09:19] <tocka> how to check did it return anything or not?
[07:09:31] <tocka> i mean if(html == ""){}
[07:09:35] <tocka> something like that
[07:12:22] <Jon47> mongoob: do you have any class names you can use to traverse the DOM more specifically?  myElement.closest('.common-parent').find('.my-target');
[07:16:06] <johnathanb> Any reason why $.each would be messing up the order of my object?
[07:16:55] <GreekFreak> Hi all. I'm new to jQuery and I'm trying to create a submit button, based on my theme, but instead of text it must have the a Framework icon. I've tried various things, and so far I can only get the button to appear with txt
[07:17:02] <johnathanb> https://gist.github.com/2988906
[07:17:03] <ajpiano> johnathanb: objects in javascript are fundamentally unordered
[07:17:23] <ajpiano> their keys will be itereated in different orders in different browsers
[07:17:45] <johnathanb> But this is going through and pulling the first two out fine, then it's like the object is flipped upside down
[07:17:47] <ajpiano> johnathanb: if you want something that's ordered you have to use an array
[07:18:08] <wwilliams> I would assume their order would be determined by the order their loaded into the DOM
[07:19:02] <Dave_Stein> Any ideas? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11191073/is-there-a-good-workaround-for-jquery-sortable-jumping-on-vertical-lists
[07:19:04] <johnathanb> Yea, when I console.log weeks everything is there in the order I put it in. When I get inside the each and console.log i it brings the first two out as it should then it's like it starts taking the rest from the bottom
[07:19:13] <Dave_Stein> fiddle in link
[07:19:29] <GreekFreak> If it helps, this is the code that's not showing me what I want https://gist.github.com/2988924
[07:20:05] <ajpiano> johnathanb: it's not "taking the rest from the bottom"
[07:20:09] <ajpiano> objects *do not have an order*
[07:20:29] <johnathanb> But it's not just picking them out randomly...
[07:20:54] <Dave_Stein> jonathanb there is a "weird" sorting order of objects depending on the browser
[07:21:20] <Dave_Stein> i think it auto-orders by numbers then characters so 1,2,apple,banana
[07:21:32] <Dave_Stein> only way to ensure order are through arrays
[07:21:33] <johnathanb> Ah, see the key I'm using is dates
[07:21:50] <Dave_Stein> but even with what i said you cant rely on objects for order
[07:21:53] <Dave_Stein> like ajpiano said
[07:22:27] <javalover> guys this is a css question but nobody is responding
[07:22:38] <ijz> Hey guys, I've been following some of the examples given here: http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/branches/labs/selectmenu/index.html - however, I can't seem to be able to place a text-box in the same line as the select menu and I've been scouring the CSS etc for ages. Any idea what I'm supposed to be doing?
[07:23:00] <javalover> so  I have [img]abc  and I want ABC to be aligned in the center with [img] to the left of that centered text...how I do this?
[07:24:29] <shoky> GreekFreak: just put  class="ui-icon ui-icon-contact" on your button
[07:24:44] <shoky> sorry ui-icon-search
[07:26:52] <GreekFreak> shoky, that did it. but it's displaying 2 icons. Is that right?
[07:27:23] <GreekFreak> shoky, well, it's not but I'm just checking if it's right to simply add the class with nothing else
[07:27:28] <shoky> prolly your button's too big or smth :\
[07:27:30] <shoky> dono
[07:28:36] <shoky> GreekFreak: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nhBxq/9/
[07:29:35] <GreekFreak> shoky, thank. At I'll fiddle a bit. You gave me a good place to start from ;)
[07:30:27] <javalover> imma ask again so I want ABC to be centered but I want the img to then go directly to the left of ABC
[07:30:46] <javalover> so ABC is directly in center but then it looks like  [img]ABC
[07:30:48] <shoky> javalover: give us a fiddle to start from.
[07:30:53] <javalover> k good idea one sec
[07:31:34] <javalover> here lets use this guys
[07:31:35] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/5L5V9/64/
[07:31:51] <javalover> only his image is off, how would we fix his image so it aligns to left of text which is centered?
[07:32:09] <javalover> the reason I chose this, is this guy had same question & made this fiddle haha
[07:33:09] <shoky> first of all lets have an image  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5L5V9/66/
[07:33:45] <javalover> so you had same issue I had originally than shoky, where image didn't show
[07:33:54] <shoky> what?
[07:33:55] <javalover> haha I checked my browser when you said that & I could finally see the wordpress image but nice.
[07:34:04] <shoky> oh
[07:34:10] <javalover> yeah when I first loaded I had no image
[07:34:18] <shoky> i still dont see one there..
[07:34:18] <javalover> but it showed up an hour later lulz
[07:34:22] <javalover> haha I know right
[07:34:24] <javalover> I had same issue
[07:34:31] <shoky> ah when i load it by itself its there
[07:34:36] <javalover> hahaha
[07:34:41] <javalover> someone should really tell that guy anyways
[07:34:43] <EYES_> same
[07:34:46] <javalover> it's an accepted answer btw
[07:34:50] <javalover> lets all use shoky's though
[07:35:03] <javalover> cuz it's a cat & I love cats
[07:35:19] <FJ1> @shoky looks like a core bug :-) http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11969
[07:36:22] <javalover> anyways can anyone tell me how to get this image http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5L5V9/66/ aligned to the left of the centered text?
[07:36:33] <shoky> FJ1: cool
[07:37:00] <javalover> and I want the centered text to remain in same position...but if I change the text the image should follow suit
[07:37:19] <shoky> are you talking about horizontal or vertical alignment ?
[07:37:25] <javalover> horizontal
[07:37:49] <shoky> k
[07:37:57] <javalover> the problem is if I position relative, the text gets bumped over
[07:39:17] <shoky> you mean like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5L5V9/68/
[07:39:42] <shoky> (that it gets bumped over)
[07:40:27] <javalover> yeah I don't want the bump
[07:40:32] <javalover> that is perfect if we don't have a bump issue
[07:40:42] <javalover> in fact the image will always be the same
[07:40:44] <shoky> k
[07:40:52] <javalover> if we could somehow incorporate this into what we're centering I guess that could fix it
[07:41:52] <shoky> btw is that  rela1tive  on purpose ;>
[07:42:02] <javalover> no it's not
[07:42:05] <javalover> but I did fix it & it did nothing
[07:42:11] <javalover> again this is someoen elses fiddle haha
[07:44:05] <javalover> I guess what I could do is move the whole thing over
[07:44:08] <javalover> like to the left...
[07:44:28] <shoky> mm
[07:45:13] <shoky> javalover: how about http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5L5V9/71/
[07:46:04] <javalover> PERFECT!
[07:46:09] <javalover> or should I say purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrfect
[07:46:12] <shoky> ;]
[07:46:28] <javalover> howzors?
[07:46:32] <javalover> i don't get it why does this work?
[07:46:51] <shoky> because the overflow is visible on the .text div
[07:47:06] <javalover> uhuh sure but like
[07:47:14] <javalover> why absolute & then right 100%?
[07:47:22] <javalover> i just honestly I don't get formatting is why i'm asking
[07:47:25] <shoky> the image is absolutely positioned in it, with its right side set to the left edge of the div
[07:47:29] <shoky> er of the span
[07:47:34] <javalover> ohhhh
[07:47:36] <javalover> neat trick
[07:54:05] <Dave_Stein> anyone check that stack question I posted? It's getting no lvoe on the site? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11191073/is-there-a-good-workaround-for-jquery-sortable-jumping-on-vertical-lists | http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/Qb9xJ/
[07:54:13] <Dave_Stein> or love!
[07:57:59] <saulotoledo> hello all. I want do a jQuery.load() in a external page. Can I do with some jQuery function without be blocked?
[07:58:53] <chomp> well, Dave_Stein you might consider rephrasing your question to be more general
[07:59:17] <chomp> the actual headline is fine, but the content of the question is ridiculously specific to your use case
[08:00:25] <Dave_Stein> chomp: it happens for any nested vertical lists using sortable
[08:00:45] <Dave_Stein> chomp: i know the question itself is very specific because i'm using specific kinds of objects to hopefuly be more clear than not
[08:00:51] <chomp> it's not that i don't believe you, it's that i'm trying to help you write a stackoverflow post that will actually get answers
[08:01:11] <Dave_Stein> i know. i can rewrite it a bit
[08:03:49] <Dave_Stein> chomp: I updated it a bit... i suck with words sometimes
[08:05:11] <chomp> "I'm attempting to allow users to drag projects into groups while the groupsa projects are sortable as well"  should not be the first sentence of the post; I'm not even sure it should be in the post at all unless you plan to describe this system first, outside of a jsfiddle post
[08:08:35] <Dave_Stein> chomp: okay i added lots of context
[08:09:36] <zim> Hi all. Having a mind fart :-) what would you call the id, class, data-* etc I am writing a script that generates them and need to name the var (Need Coffee) LOL
[08:09:38] <Dave_Stein> actually i wonder with my crappy workaround, that i can drop the project onto the main list and just append it like i was doing with projects into groups
[08:09:43] <zim> in short what is the collective name for the stuff in ===><===    <div ==> id="myid" class="foo" style="width:500px;"  <===  >
[08:09:43] <chomp> there's an upvote :p
[08:09:45] <Dave_Stein> attribute
[08:09:51] <Dave_Stein> zim: attribute
[08:09:54] <chomp> i don't actually know anything about sortable, so
[08:10:05] <zim> Dave_Stein: ty
[08:10:09] <Dave_Stein> i started rewriting it a few months ago and got bogged down with work :)
[08:10:20] <Dave_Stein> im getting company time to help out ui after this last project or im gonna kill someone here haha
[08:11:14] <javalover> well shoky it took me forever to implement that but it's working woohoo!
[08:11:25] <MysterOnyx> on page load, jquery AJAX gets data from 2 tables to populate 1 array. When a user clicks a button on the page, I want it to only get data from one of the tables to update the array. Would it be best to set up 2 separate AJAX functions? If so, then at page load I'll be running 2 separate AJAX calls instead of 1. I'm guessing this isn't most efficient?
[08:11:52] <chomp> Dave_Stein, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3290494/jquery-sortable-nested-ul-elements http://mjsarfatti.com/sandbox/nestedSortable/
[08:11:59] <chomp> May want to check those out.
[08:12:51] <Dave_Stein> ha wow
[08:13:00] <Dave_Stein> why would he write his own rather than try to make the actual one better? :P
[08:13:27] <Dave_Stein> i see he's cheating though in a way
[08:13:34] <Dave_Stein> it's interesting
[08:13:59] <Dave_Stein> when you drag down in a sublist it assumes you want to be in the sublist OR 2 items later
[08:14:12] <Dave_Stein> and when you drag up you can place the draggable right below the sublist
[08:14:37] <Dave_Stein> actually that was by chance... he factors in your mouse horizontal position
[08:17:02] <Dave_Stein> chomp: designers unhappy with that ha
[08:17:25] <chomp> Dave_Stein, that sucks, does the designer have any useful feedback?  maybe a better idea?
[08:17:47] <Dave_Stein> i hear them talking about it while i send them more fiddles ha
[08:17:52] <chomp> because that's a plugin that solves the problem you're currently trying to hack around in what is probably a very ugly way
[08:18:01] <chomp> sounds like a solution to me
[08:18:07] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[08:18:29] <Dave_Stein> it would obviously be best if just going vertical worked, but thats not the case, so maybe i can warm them up to moving the mouse left and right to get what you want
[08:18:35] <Dave_Stein> :)
[08:18:49] <Dave_Stein> oh they are calling me ha
[08:21:46] <_Z3R0> Anyone ever had the "ghost" problem, of sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't? I'm looking into the .one() method, but I just can't seem to figure it out, and sadly, nothing outputs as a problem.
[08:22:30] <codeshah> hey guys, want to read a file into an array, then get unique and rewrite to file - how do I do this?
[08:22:54] <Dave_Stein> chomp: they are fine with that fiddle i have, of it freaking out a little bit and said i'm focusing too much on it ha
[08:23:17] <Dave_Stein> oi oi oi
[08:23:29] <chomp> poor them
[08:23:50] <chomp> i guess i don't typically expect designers to make good decisions, so eh
[08:24:25] <Dave_Stein> well it's easy for me to handle now and if it becomes issue later i can spend more time on it later i guess
[08:24:42] <WimLeers> Does it make sense to use .delegate() when the node the event is being attached to is a very, very far ancestor of the node it's going to handle events for? (Since the nodes it needs to handle events for can be anywhere, I'm using $('body').delegate()…) It seems that in this case, it might be better to bind event handlers to each item separately?
[08:25:09] <Dave_Stein> WimLeers: As far as I know it's best practice to always use delegate even in that case
[08:25:41] <Dave_Stein> cause at least it iwll stop on body and not go up to html :)
[08:33:24] <blackgreetz> hello, is somewhere written down, what "ui" means / represents at jquery ui-event functions? like stop: function(event, ui) < what is ui?!
[08:33:45] <NodeX> the UI object I think
[08:34:42] <blackgreetz> well, but which methods / options does it have?
[08:35:15] <blackgreetz> looks like it's different every time but nowhere clearly explained
[08:35:32] <blackgreetz> so every time = which each functionality
[08:35:35] <NodeX> console.log(ui); - see what it is
[08:37:15] <blackgreetz> NodeX: could it be that old firefox version doesnt know "console" ?
[08:37:23] <mitjak> blackgreetz, it depends on what widget. a droppable will produce a different UI object than say, a slider
[08:38:01] <blackgreetz> mitjak: yes, exactly, is it explained somewhere? so which function are under which widget available ?
[08:38:02] <NodeX> All callbacks receive two arguments: The original browser event and a prepared ui object, view below for a documentation of this object (if you name your second argument 'ui'):
[08:38:15] <NodeX> http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/   <--- read the overview tab
[08:38:52] <NodeX> it seems it's the ui object itself that's extended with helpers for varying different methods
[08:39:03] <NodeX> methods / properties
[08:41:00] <blackgreetz> hm okay.. looks like missed the explained on the draggable widget
[08:41:06] <MysterOnyx> can json handle arrays?
[08:41:20] <WimLeers> Dave_Stein: Thanks! Much appreciated. But why would it go up to HTML if the event is handled right on the DOM element where it occurred in the first place?
[08:41:31] <blackgreetz> NodeX, mitjak; thanks
[08:42:37] <Whirl3d> _Z3R0, what is your question?
[08:42:38] <MysterOnyx> I can send arrays through json, such as [{'meal[1]':'test','meal[2]':'test2'}]
[08:42:40] <Dave_Stein> WimLeers: you mean bind rather than delegate? I honestly can't remember the internals but I know i've had this conversation with other guys before and delegate always wins as the better option
[08:42:46] <_Z3R0> one sec sorry
[08:42:48] <MysterOnyx> can I8
[08:42:52] <_Z3R0> found a friend of mine that can help, thanks though
[08:43:01] <Whirl3d> np
[08:46:55] <WimLeers> Dave_Stein: sorry for my poorly worded sentence — and thanks again :)
[08:52:39] <g-hennux> hi!
[08:56:56] <andrewofpie> Hi all. I have an issue with trying to use jQuery UI's sortable component in an iframe (but initialised from outside the iframe). Here is the simplest html I could come up with: http://dpaste.com/763284/ (parent page) http://dpaste.com/763286/ (iframe page)
[08:57:19] <andrewofpie> it definitely does something, but I think the problem is how events are handled between the documents
[08:59:46] <andrewofpie> campaign monitor have it working in their new email editor, but I can't figure out how they did it
[09:00:27] <blackgreetz> anyone: http://jsfiddle.net/gm2sV/ looks like the draggable option doesnt really works?! if you drag the image and move your mouse to the bottom (out of the frame), the image will move out of its parent
[09:00:55] <blackgreetz> -s
[09:01:21] <GreekFreak> I've been battling with some code s h o k y gave me (http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nhBxq/9/), and for the life of me I can't seem to get it to work with an input[type-submit] button. Or am I supposed to use the span and use the .submit() method using JS?
[09:03:25] <Whirl3d> blackgreetz, that fiddle works fine for me
[09:04:22] <blackgreetz> Whirl3d: really? click on the fiddle image and move mouse out of the frame(bottom) ?
[09:05:02] <thomedy> whirl3d it looks like history.js is more robust then hashchange which by the way works well and quickly but im told history.js is a better option
[09:05:15] <Whirl3d> blackgreetz, it stays in it's container.
[09:05:52] <blackgreetz> hmm.. could it be, that old browsers are not supported by jquery (ui), like firefox 3.x , Whirl3d ?
[09:06:00] <shoky> lol GreekFreak thanks for trying not to highlight, but 'antishok' highlights me too ;DD
[09:07:12] <thomedy> some how i have to take links generated by a cms and then place a hashbang infront of them
[09:07:13] <Whirl3d> blackgreetz, you'd have to look it up on jqueryUI's site. I doubt it though. maybe try it in a different browser or clear your cache?
[09:07:25] <thomedy> i was thinking about window.location.href
[09:07:34] <thomedy> but i think that will modify the content
[09:07:35] <Whirl3d> thomedy, that should be easy enough
[09:07:53] <g-hennux> hi!
[09:07:56] <Whirl3d> just come up with a structure and stick to it...
[09:07:58] <GreekFreak> shoky, sorry :P
[09:07:58] <shoky> GreekFreak: you can try using a button with type=submit instead of an input
[09:08:27] <GreekFreak> shoky, hmm I'll give it a try
[09:08:29] <thomedy> i love easy especially after all this intense learning i both enjoy and that wears me out for sure
[09:08:33] <Whirl3d> like for your site, you could have [section]-[subsection]?=itemid
[09:08:34] <blackgreetz> Whirl3d: it's not a problem of my cache, because i found this on my page and reproduced it on fiddle for the channel..; is fiddle working with IE8, because i get an JS error there..?
[09:08:40] <shoky> GreekFreak cause <input>s are child-less
[09:08:55] <g-hennux> i'm doing an ajax call in drupal using $.ajax and type="json" and when i get the result "TEST\x3cp\x3eblub\x3c/p\x3e", in one instance of my drupal site, this works fine, in another i get a syntax error because of \x.
[09:09:49] <shoky> GreekFreak: and of course, manually calling .submit from the click handler is a fine option too
[09:09:58] <blackgreetz> okay, this plugin should be fine in "Firefox 3+," ...
[09:09:59] <g-hennux> now i found out that apparently $.ajax is a different function on my live drupal instance than it is on my dev drupal instance. the "working one" is like "function (M){M=o.extend(true,M,o.extend(true,{ [...]", the non-working one is like "function (a,c){function w(a,c,l,m){if(s!==2){s=2, [...]"
[09:10:34] <g-hennux> and i'm wondering whether anyone of you recognizes this and/or could tell me what happens here and why i get an error for that string up there
[09:13:38] <blackgreetz> Whirl3d: well, it also happens in IE8 (on my site); fiddle brings up JS error so i can't test it there..
[09:14:29] <shoky> g-hennux: what error? when exactly does it happen?
[09:14:56] <MysterOnyx> I'm struggling with how to set up my code. On page load, an AJAX call populates an array with a user's meals. I then want to populate another array with all of the foods attached to those meals (said foods are in a separate table). Would it be best to populate the meals in an AJAX call and then do a second AJAX call to get the foods, or should I do it all in one AJAX? The reason I ask is because
[09:14:57] <MysterOnyx> the user will be able to edit the foods while the page is running.. when I update the foods I don't want to reupdate the entire page.. just the foods.
[09:15:43] <g-hennux> shoky: i POST some content to mysite.com/system/lightbox2/filter-xss in a non-async ajax call and i get as a response "TEST\x3cp\x3eblub\x3c/p\x3e" (which is valid json, afaik).
[09:16:03] <shoky> non-async *shudder*
[09:16:14] <g-hennux> and i get "SyntaxError: JSON.parse: bad escaped character" in firefox
[09:16:18] <shoky> that's a valid js string, not valid json
[09:16:41] <shoky> what dataType did you set ?
[09:16:52] <g-hennux> "json"
[09:16:53] <anew> http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/marketo/  i'm trying to follow this very simple jq demo, but i cant find the function that handles the button click
[09:16:58] <shoky> g-hennux: there's your problem
[09:17:14] <NoiseEee> MysterOnyx: xhr / ajax is another request for data from the server so that you don't have to update the entire page, just update the DOM with the data returned somehow
[09:17:39] <g-hennux> BUT, the problem is, that this code comes from a library (it's the lightbox2 module of drupal) and it works perfectly on my live site; but it does not on my dev site (with essentially the same code)
[09:17:54] <NoiseEee> MysterOnyx: that being said, if there aren't many variations of foods, you can just write them out as objects in the script itself and update when required.
[09:18:08] <thomedy> yoru right 3d it wa san easy fix ijust made a smal test in my locahost
[09:18:19] <thomedy> and its super simple its exactly what i expected
[09:18:22] <shoky> g-hennux: regardless of whatever may be working. if your ajax call is not returning json, then trying to parse it as json should fail
[09:18:24] <g-hennux> shoky: in chrome it's "SyntaxError: Unexpected token x"
[09:19:48] <MysterOnyx> NoiseEee yea there are a lot of variations to the foods
[09:20:03] <MysterOnyx> lots of properties that are modifiable by the user
[09:20:30] <MysterOnyx> and each time a property is changed, I want to auto update the database and then update the element on the page to reflect said change
[09:21:24] <MysterOnyx> this is why I don't want to have one large ajax call because then I'd ultimately be reloading the entire page any time someone changes one property
[09:21:54] <MysterOnyx> so I guess it'd be best to load the page initially with a bunch of separate AJAX calls so I can separately call them later one
[09:21:56] <MysterOnyx> later on*
[09:22:49] <anew> http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/marketo/  any help on this how to find the function on the button?
[09:23:32] <shoky> anew: it's just a submit button
[09:24:01] <anew> ya but what is the fastest way to find the jq that is handling the click event ?
[09:24:18] <shoky> anew: looking at the source code of that plugin
[09:24:47] <shoky> anew: it's probably not handling any click event
[09:24:52] <shoky> anew: it's handling the form submit event
[09:24:52] <anew> there is no way to do it in console? an easy way?
[09:25:06] <shoky> no, we've been through this :)
[09:25:07] <anew> how can you tell what events are tied to something then
[09:25:09] <anew> yeah
[09:25:09] <anew> lol
[09:25:19] <shoky> its a submit button
[09:25:23] <anew> i was hoping i missed something lol
[09:25:24] <shoky> obviously a submit event is tied to it.
[09:25:37] <anew> right but there can be 10 other events tied to it
[09:25:39] <shoky> that plugin is a form validation plugin
[09:25:46] <shoky> so it needs to handle form submits and validate
[09:25:46] <anew> how cna you find all events tied to something
[09:26:00] <shoky> anew: nothing is tied to that button though
[09:26:06] <shoky> anew: its tied to the form element
[09:26:16] <anew> how do you see that
[09:26:38] <shoky> because i know what the plugin does and am using my common sense
[09:26:55] <anew> bah... not the answer i'm looking for lol
[09:27:00] <GreekFreak> shoky, having a button_tag of type submit seems not to want to accept nested elements either. Keeps wanting an $end (FYI I'm coding in rails using Haml). How far away from the norm is it to use a .submit method on the onclick?
[09:27:05] <anew> knowing what the plugin does does not work for everything
[09:27:10] <shoky> anew you won't find the answer you're looking for.
[09:27:11] <anew> i need something i can consistantly use
[09:27:19] <shoky> you won't find that
[09:27:21] <anew> anyone else have any ideas ?
[09:27:30] <shoky> especially not in this case
[09:27:38] <shoky> because it absolutely has nothing to do with the button itself
[09:27:39] <anew> and there is a click event on the button
[09:27:45] <anew> so u must be wrong about that
[09:27:49] <shoky> the click event on the button is not doing anything in this case
[09:28:15] <shoky> the browser knows it was clicked, so it triggers a form submit event
[09:29:03] <anew> anyone know how to find what events are tied to what divs ?
[09:29:22] <shoky> GreekFreak: it's not far from the norm at all, it's pretty standard afaik
[09:29:46] <shoky> GreekFreak: but <button> works fine with nested elements
[09:30:14] <anew> plus there are about 23 events on that page shoky... so 'common sense' is impossible to tell what those are
[09:30:15] <shoky> GreekFreak: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/nhBxq/10/
[09:30:39] <shoky> anew: i must be wrong about what?
[09:30:55] <GreekFreak> shoky, thanx. trying it now
[09:31:43] <anew> there has to be a way to debug jq, ur explanations are not helpful
[09:31:55] <s8> What do you do, when you need to call something to end the plugin's work, but you're trying to do it from inside the plugin's functions and it doesn't worK? (but does after/in setTimeout)
[09:31:56] <shoky> oh, i must be wrong then
[09:34:04] <shoky> anew: hey look, there are absolutely no click handlers registered, but the button does something.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/CLmr8/
[09:35:02] <anew> when i make an event listener for a click a breakpoint is set tho
[09:35:05] <Whirl3d> anew, if you don't like the correct answer find another channel. Everyone in this channel that knows his head from a hole in the ground is going to agree with shoky, not because he is so generous and not because he helps so many people every day, but rather because he's right!
[09:35:32] <shoky> when you make an event listener, a breakpoint is set? huh?
[09:37:18] <GreekFreak> shoky, you wouldn't happen to use Haml would you? lol
[09:37:30] <shoky> GreekFreak nope sry
[09:37:41] <GreekFreak> shoky, ah well lol
[09:37:46] <ajpiano> anew: check out this bookmarklet
[09:37:47] <ajpiano> http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2
[09:37:54] <anew> whirl3d it's not the correct answer
[09:38:04] <anew> ur sticking up for an answer that u dont know about
[09:38:09] <anew> ajpiano, yes that's exactly what i'm using
[09:38:11] <anew> thanks
[09:38:51] <anew> that's actually the best thing i've found, now i'm just wondering if in the console there is a way to see what each event is using as a function to go with that bookmarklet
[09:40:25] <thomedy> im getting there
[09:41:33] <CIDIC> does anyone know how to make a specific item not draggable when using jquery.ui sortable (other than the methods in the docs) ?
[09:42:08] <shoky> anew: when you set an event listener in chrome on the button, and you get a breakpoint, that's inside one of your chrome extensions. if you disable all of them you wont get any breakpoint. (talking about my fiddle)
[09:42:24] <shoky> at least i dont
[09:44:13] <g-hennux> shoky: ok, i found the reason for my two drupal instances behaving differently. now i'm ready to receive your idea about how i should do the ajax call correctly :)
[09:44:13] <Whirl3d> I'm expecting this to be a semantics issue. The problem as I see it is that the "event" which triggers the validation plugin you mentioned is fired natively (not by jquery) when an html input type=submit element is clicked. That event is the "submit" event. The plugin you showed grabs the Submit event on the form, not the button.
[09:45:07] <Whirl3d> that way if another element (other than that button) were to try to submit the form, the plugin would still be able to grab it and validate it.
[09:45:39] <Whirl3d> if it bound itself to the button and another button (or script) tried to submit the event, it would miss it.
[09:46:35] <shoky> g-hennux: er i forgot the issue already ;P are you waiting to receive an idea from me?
[09:47:12] <anew> hmmm right good point so it's not tied to the button... so fine... when the event happens on the form, where is the function that executes after form submission then ?
[09:47:44] <g-hennux> oh, no, wait. it says on the JSON wikipedia page that a valid json value can be a string in double quotes with escape sequences. so "TEST\x3cp\x3eblub\x3c/p\x3e" would be valid json, or not?
[09:47:58] <thomedy> dude... whirl3d
[09:47:59] <thomedy> i got it
[09:48:05] <thomedy> i got me hashes everywhere now
[09:48:14] <GreekFreak> shoky, got it to work. I needed a 'content_tag :button, type: "submit"' to allow for nested elements.... Don't ask :P
[09:48:17] <GreekFreak> thanks for the help
[09:48:19] <thomedy> and i read that i should follow the has wht the bang so thats there too
[09:48:29] <shoky> anew: you can set an event listener on 'submit' event in chrome if you want
[09:48:31] <thomedy> now just to harness the raw power of back and book marks
[09:49:16] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/2v5vQ/ <- is there a proper way to open a jquery dialog from a parent selector
[09:49:33] <Whirl3d> thomedy, it's tricky for me to release the need to manage every single button and rely on the buttons to do their thing by listening for them on the hashchange event...but it makes navigation a lot simpler...
[09:49:41] <anew> call stack never shows the proper function that way
[09:50:11] <shoky> anew: and you can do $('#theform').data('events').submit  to see jq handlers registered. (not a documented feature though)
[09:50:23] <thomedy> well  maybe im just stupid but i dont understand what your saying...
[09:50:36] <thomedy> release the need to  manage every single button?
[09:51:13] <Whirl3d> in other words, in my navigation elements, rather than $("nav.a").click(funciton ()      you can just let the nav elements add the nav location to the url and hashchange will catch it
[09:51:33] <shoky> anew: the call stack is not the place to look when you set an event listener.. you need to step into the code some until it calls the actual handler you're interested in
[09:51:38] <thomedy> okay i think i understand
[09:52:19] <Whirl3d> so you can forget all the navigation handler codes and just rely on the anchor elements to change the hash and voila-you manage the content centrally....it can be really powerful.
[09:52:45] <Whirl3d> for you, for example, you don't need to worry about handling the click on the section buttons...
[09:52:56] <anew> the main window? yes it just bounces around jquery.js library here... never gets to a 'real' function
[09:52:56] <Whirl3d> just have them change the url to #section
[09:53:19] <Whirl3d> then you know whenever the url changes to #section if its not the currently viewed section, animate it up.
[09:53:20] <thomedy> if i understand correctly that might change the structure of my code
[09:53:25] <thomedy> i hope i dont have to do that
[09:53:41] <Whirl3d> it can make a ton of your code disappear
[09:53:45] <thomedy> oh you know what i think i was thinking about that and that was a concern
[09:53:49] <Whirl3d> because you handle it all in one place
[09:54:00] <thomedy> i think i am going to if i understand what yoursaying take my animation from the href instead of the click
[09:54:01] <thomedy> yes?
[09:54:14] <Whirl3d> precisely
[09:54:18] <thomedy> yeah
[09:54:33] <Whirl3d> when your links change the url to #newsection  you handle the animation then
[09:54:38] <thomedy> the reason i was thinking that is during back and forward clicks or just typing in the url
[09:54:43] <thomedy> those arent clicks
[09:54:49] <thomedy> but i still need the proper slide
[09:54:53] <thomedy> so thats what i was thinking
[09:55:13] <Whirl3d> right plus manually entering a section doens't fire a click event
[09:55:23] <thomedy> diddo
[09:55:23] <Whirl3d> if I want menswear, I can enter #menswear
[09:55:40] <thomedy> my concern is i still want to animate off a click too
[09:55:46] <thomedy> from the fron page
[09:55:52] <Whirl3d> perfect.
[09:55:57] <thomedy> so it needs to start for 25% div containers
[09:55:58] <Whirl3d> the click will change the hash
[09:56:04] <thomedy> yeah...
[09:56:13] <thomedy> and then when i navigate to front page i get the css
[09:56:26] <thomedy> hmmm. this seems like its going to take some thought
[09:56:27] <Whirl3d> and if the hash is blank, show the home page
[09:56:30] <thomedy> but this is what learning about
[09:56:33] <thomedy> ohh thank you
[09:56:35] <anew> ok so i just set an event listener for submit on this page... and the entire time it ust stepped thru jquery.js ... how does that make any sense
[09:56:35] <thomedy> way better
[09:56:47] <thomedy> okay that is easy
[09:56:48] <thomedy> i hope
[09:56:59] <Whirl3d> thomedy, it will take surprising less thought...it's just tricky to relax and trust it.
[09:57:00] <Whirl3d> lol
[09:57:16] <thomedy> i wish i knew as much before i started this project 6 months ago as i have learned doing the project
[09:57:30] <thomedy> i would have been able to think this through a head of time and do it right hte first time
[09:57:34] <thomedy> but hey im learning boom
[09:58:24] <Whirl3d> and your learning quickly...its a good thing.
[09:58:34] <thomedy> okay so heres what im thinking
[09:58:41] <thomedy> i should through my href into an array
[09:59:04] <shoky> GoGoGarrett: first of all, .parent() is wrong because the dialog <div>s are not parents of the <a>
[09:59:10] <thomedy> and check both the length() of the array for 1st time the page loads and which hash im on
[09:59:43] <Whirl3d> anew, jquery listens for the native submit event when you tell it to by using bind.
[09:59:53] <thomedy> i love writing code you guys are awesome
[09:59:57] <Whirl3d> just like the scroll event or any other native event
[10:00:01] <shoky> GoGoGarrett: but either way, calling .dialog on the divs moves them in the DOM
[10:00:09] <thomedy> native means what
[10:00:19] <shoky> GoGoGarrett: one way to go is:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/2v5vQ/1/
[10:00:32] <Whirl3d> fired by the dom...it would happen whether javascript was loaded or jquery or any library.
[10:00:40] <thomedy> okay cool
[10:00:42] <thomedy> thank you
[10:00:44] <shoky> anew: no that doesnt make much sense
[10:00:55] <anew> whirl3d right, but shouldnt it eventually be passed to a written function ??
[10:01:06] <anew> you guys can try it... if you step thru you just get jquery.js the entire time
[10:01:08] <Whirl3d> what do you mean by passed?
[10:01:10] <shoky> anew: did you step into ?
[10:01:11] <GoGoGarrett> Thanks.
[10:01:12] <anew> i need to step thru and see actual functions
[10:01:18] <shoky> you need to step into...
[10:01:41] <thomedy> okay first things first back ups
[10:01:48] <anew> that's what i mean... i used "step into next function call"
[10:01:49] <Whirl3d> it sounds to me like you want to know how the browser is compiled...it's the browser that is handling the submit event
[10:01:55] <ajpiano> anew: you have to use the Call Stack
[10:02:17] <shoky> anew: if you step into , like when it's calling  jQuery.event.handle.apply
[10:02:27] <shoky> anew: or var ret = handler.apply(this, arguments);
[10:02:41] <shoky> anew: when you step into the last one, it'll take you to the plugin code
[10:03:11] <anew> put it this way.. eventually i should be stepping into mktSignup.js ... but i never get there
[10:03:11] <anew> why
[10:03:20] <shoky> why into mktSignup
[10:03:21] <shoky> ?
[10:03:39] <shoky> the validation plugin is the one handling the submit
[10:03:53] <shoky> and it does take you into the validation code
[10:03:58] <thomedy> okay im going to get som eluch and then come back to it
[10:04:09] <thomedy> while i plan this process out
[10:04:21] <thomedy> all i really need honestly is some sort of identifier in my href
[10:04:24] <thomedy> and i thinki have that
[10:04:32] <thomedy> all my menswear starts with men
[10:04:39] <anew> so then what is mktsignup.js for then
[10:04:41] <thomedy> and womens weear starts with women
[10:04:45] <thomedy> so on and so on
[10:04:49] <shoky> anew: for initializing the validation plugin
[10:04:50] <thomedy> i thinkim set on the structure
[10:05:06] <Whirl3d> thomedy, right on.
[10:05:13] <shoky> and other shit that page has, who knows
[10:05:17] <thomedy> alright im going to go veggie it up
[10:05:35] <anew> this makes no sense... inside mktsignup.js is $("form").validate({ which validates the form
[10:05:52] <shoky> anew it makes perfect sense :\
[10:06:05] <shoky> anew: that INITIALIZES the plugin
[10:06:12] <shoky> anew: and then that code doesnt run anymore
[10:06:25] <anew> ya so why when i setup an event listener, i never see it !
[10:06:34] <anew> it runs at form submit
[10:06:37] <anew> then the plugin runs
[10:06:39] <shoky> no it doesnt
[10:06:48] <shoky> $('form').validate runs on page load
[10:06:53] <shoky> not on form submit
[10:06:56] <ajpiano> anew: in your config object, there are functions that you are passing that it runs later
[10:06:58] <ajpiano> ?
[10:07:07] <jaequery> anyone here got experience w/ jqtouch?
[10:07:52] <anew> ajpiano i dont understand ur question
[10:08:26] <ajpiano> where are you defining the handlers that you expect to be run?
[10:08:41] <ajpiano> or are you trying to introspect the handlers that the validation plugin itself attaches
[10:08:44] <shoky> he's just trying to debug random pages on the web, i think ;>
[10:08:55] <anew> debug random pages yes lol
[10:09:05] <anew> so how the hell are you supposed to know what fires at page load then
[10:09:13] <anew> that handles the form submit
[10:09:28] <anew> i just dont get how you are supposed to debug these pages with 50 events firing
[10:09:47] <anew> just set event listeners for everything?
[10:09:50] <anew> then step thru it all ?
[10:09:56] <anew> i want to kill myself
[10:09:57] <ajpiano> no?
[10:10:00] <shoky> anew: you just read the code!
[10:10:05] <ajpiano> write the event listeners you need, and then set breakpoints inside of them
[10:10:24] <anew> yeah but what if it's 1000 lines of code ... and if u dont know what is firing when - how do u know what event listeners u need !
[10:10:26] <ajpiano> i have some slides on debugging jquery tips, might be useful? i don't know, see ?ftp
[10:10:30] <bot-t> ajpiano, #10552 (Ajax response status 0)  jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 8 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10552
[10:10:36] <shoky> lol
[10:10:38] <ajpiano> i mean, see ?ftj
[10:10:39] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[10:10:48] <ajpiano> anew: what do you mean, you "don't know what events are happening?"
[10:11:43] <anew> ajpiano i mean just now, i thought something was tied to a click on the button - i was wrong, everyone said it was tied to form submit, ok so then i inspect that, and i was wrong about that, now i find out it fires on page load.....ok so now i inspect that......all this takes like 45 minutes... there must be an easier way.....
[10:12:39] <ajpiano> anew: this is the code the validation plugin executes on submit
[10:12:40] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/blob/master/jquery.validate.js#L54
[10:13:07] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/blob/master/jquery.validate.js#L40-92
[10:13:22] <GreekFreak> shoky, I finally managed to get it to work, but now it seems to show 2 icons, depending on the padding I use. Could you take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/tscholiadis/nhBxq/11/
[10:14:10] <anew> ajpiano, ok but then what about what calls this code...
[10:14:33] <ajpiano> anew: you're not really getting at the core of the problem, it seems like you're just trying to grasp at some magical spot that will land you in the code
[10:14:43] <ajpiano> you should describe the actual problems that you're having, not the symptom
[10:14:47] <anew> i want to kill myself... i been looking at this for days
[10:15:13] <ajpiano> why do you need to debug inside of the validation plugin's handlers
[10:15:22] <anew> ok... just simply.... i load this page... i hit 'submit'... js fires and says i did not fill anything out with error messages
[10:15:33] <anew> just simply how can i see what functions are being used and what event is handling that
[10:15:42] <mzarella> i want to put something on the top of the browser's view, window.top, right?
[10:15:45] <ajpiano> read the code of the validation plugin
[10:15:54] <mzarella> $('window.top).append?
[10:16:01] <anew> and where does mktsignup.js fit into all this ???
[10:16:12] <ajpiano> mzarella: top.document
[10:16:22] <ajpiano> anew: mktsignup.js *configures* the plugin in some way
[10:16:38] <shoky> anew: page load -> call .validate on the form -> plugin code registers an event handler, an internal one in the plugin
[10:16:47] <shoky> full stop.
[10:16:47] <ajpiano> but the nature of the validation plugin is such that most of the validation logic is contained inside of it
[10:16:52] <ajpiano> ^^
[10:17:08] <anew> i mean we have to tell the plugin to start on pageload right ?
[10:17:31] <shoky> on page load, we tell it to do its stuff and register its event handlers
[10:17:44] <shoky> then we forget about it and our code doesnt need to be involved anymore
[10:17:44] <ajpiano> anew: there is likely a $(document).ready(function() {}) block in mktsignup.js
[10:17:54] <ajpiano> or a $(function() {}) which is the same thing
[10:17:56] <shoky> there is
[10:18:16] <anew> yes, so why can i not see that when i set breakpoints on page load
[10:18:18] <anew> that's what i dont get
[10:18:42] <shoky> breakpoints in mktsignup?
[10:19:20] <anew> if mktsignup is telling the plugin to call .validate.... this is the first step of everything.... why can i not debug this first step
[10:19:20] <shoky> or are you talking about chrome's 'event listeners' thing
[10:19:22] <anew> yes or no ?
[10:19:31] <anew> chrome's event listeners
[10:19:38] <shoky> eh
[10:20:02] <shoky> if you set up breakpoints in mktsignup and reload the page, it'll break ..
[10:20:11] <anew> i tried that, it didnt break
[10:20:16] <anew> where are you setting the breakpoint?
[10:20:38] <shoky> line 3
[10:20:50] <shoky> line 1 is fine too..
[10:20:57] <Dave_Stein> I'm really be slowing with sortable today. What is the best way to allow 2 classes to be items for sortable, but not allow one type to be nested? http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/fgWEU/
[10:21:09] <Dave_Stein> or being slow rather than be slowing.. oh monday
[10:21:31] <shoky> anew: nobody said chrome's event listenres page-load event is the same thing as jquery's DOM .ready handler
[10:21:46] <anew> meh i had it on  line4 didnt work... ok so all this for a page load, but how do u know to do this?  what happens when there are 5 js files... how do u know what to look for
[10:21:57] <shoky> because line 4 is inside some callback
[10:21:58] <anew> i went from thinking it was a click event to a form submit event to a pageload event
[10:22:01] <anew> what a nightmare
[10:22:01] <shoky> that will only get called later.. maybe
[10:22:40] <anew> and what in line 3 calls the plugin ?
[10:22:53] <shoky> what?
[10:22:59] <shoky> it calls some method of the plugin
[10:23:06] <shoky> adding a new validation method or smth
[10:23:32] <shoky> then line 29 calls the actual validation initialization
[10:24:03] <shoky> if you step into that im sure sometime you'll see the form submit callback being registered
[10:26:57] <anew> jq is the devils work
[10:27:18] <shoky> there are plenty of alternatives
[10:27:25] <shoky> feel free to ditch
[10:27:45] <anew> i mean js in general.... php is so easy compared to this
[10:27:49] <shoky> :)
[10:28:01] <shoky> you and NodeX can be buddies
[10:28:16] <anew> lol
[10:28:28] <shoky> you are forgetting that this has nothing to do with js
[10:29:03] <shoky> it has to do with the fact that your code is running in a browser environment, dealing with browser events and (potentially) complex web pages
[10:29:32] <shoky> so either learn to deal with that without wanting to kill yourself, or stick to php
[10:30:23] <shoky> (it's not really as bad as you think, you need to get used to it)
[10:30:55] <anew> i mean without this bookmarklet i would have no idea what event is firing whre
[10:31:21] <shoky> ok. how does php solve this :)
[10:32:02] <SkiOne> hi, I am using a class to trigger a click, I need to get the id of the tag that got clicked and I don't know how
[10:32:21] <shoky> SkiOne: this.id
[10:32:25] <javalover> ok I have some pretty sick code right now
[10:32:32] * SkiOne smacks forehead, thanks
[10:32:33] <Stephen_> Help!
[10:32:37] <javalover> but the error i'm having I don't understand I take it shoky can help
[10:32:41] <Stephen_> I need a coding soundtrack channel that's worth a damn
[10:32:47] <javalover> shoky have you been fixing errors all day?
[10:33:13] <shoky> javalover amongst other things ;p
[10:33:17] <ranza> is it possible to delay $.each for each run?
[10:33:18] <javalover> like 3 hours ago this kid helped me and he's still here lol
[10:33:26] <ajpiano> anew: where did "mktsignup.js" come from? another developer on your team?
[10:33:28] <javalover> ok so imma just put it out there
[10:33:28] <anew> lol
[10:33:39] <anew> ajpiano i'm definitely not on a team lol
[10:33:46] <anew> no just a webpage i was trying to debug
[10:33:48] <javalover> I'm cloning an element.   so    var a = $('#mydiv').clone(true);
[10:33:49] <anew> btw ur tut is pretty good
[10:33:56] <shoky> ajpiano it's from http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/marketo/ ;p
[10:33:57] <ajpiano> thanks
[10:34:05] <shoky> ftj++
[10:34:21] <ajpiano> anew: the basic thing is most apps/pages will have one or more document ready handlers
[10:34:31] <ajpiano> a good app will have exactly one ;)
[10:34:31] <javalover> then i'm appending this element on mouse up to an existing div so var b = $('#mydiv2');    a.appendTo(b);
[10:34:47] <javalover> how do I clear this out so it doesn't duplicate?
[10:34:58] <shoky> ranza: whacha mean?
[10:35:00] <anew> yeah this "simple" page has 23 ... a normal page can have triple that
[10:35:02] <anew> it's so ridiculous
[10:35:03] <javalover> how do I make it so everytime it's just attaching/detaching a from b & vice versa
[10:35:05] <anew> where do u even start
[10:35:18] <ajpiano> anew: which simple page has 23??
[10:35:34] <anew> http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/marketo/ this page has 23
[10:35:57] <cusco> hey... using <li class='ui-state-default'> .. their width is sometimes too short...
[10:35:58] <ajpiano> 23 what??
[10:36:02] <ajpiano> it has 1 document ready function?
[10:36:12] <anew> 23 events
[10:36:13] <cusco> should I change this directly in css, or what should I do ?
[10:36:43] <ajpiano> anew: so what?
[10:36:57] <ajpiano> anew: javascript apps are pretty much nothing *but* events
[10:37:12] <shoky> javalover: so you don't want to clone?
[10:37:20] <javalover> well I do...
[10:37:27] <javalover> the thing is i'm going to be clearing the div
[10:37:40] <javalover> so a's html is gonna change.
[10:37:47] <javalover> so i'm cloning it so I can keep the data that was there
[10:37:58] <javalover> and then I attach to b...then clear b it's a back & forth move.
[10:38:05] <shoky> can you ask the question again
[10:38:16] <javalover> essentially div A has content I want to reload into it.
[10:38:27] <javalover> hold on one sec I think of how to word this
[10:38:48] <shoky> you want to clear what is in B?
[10:38:55] <shoky> before you copy A into it?
[10:39:11] <javalover> i mean essentially yeah, what's happening right now is everytime I click it, I end up with a duplicate
[10:39:20] <shoky> b.empty()
[10:39:21] <shoky> ?
[10:39:23] <ranza> shoky: i want to add a delay in between $.each's execution
[10:39:24] <javalover> so idk if that's cuz i'm cloning b over & over
[10:39:28] <ajpiano> anew: if you put a breakpoint inside of mktsignup.js, the code will stop there
[10:39:30] <anew> ajpiano yeah but so many just makes it hard to debug ... if it wasnt for that plugin i would have no idea where to start with the events.... now i know the events and i have no idea where to find the functions tied to the events
[10:39:36] <javalover> or cloning a or whatever....but it's just creating multiple copies
[10:39:39] <javalover> and I only want the one copy
[10:39:47] <shoky> javalover: you're appending stuff to b, over and over..
[10:39:48] <ajpiano> if you step into those functions, of *course* they're defined inside of the plugin
[10:39:53] <javalover> yeah is that it?
[10:39:54] <ajpiano> anew, what are you trying to debug???
[10:39:55] <javalover> i think that's it.
[10:39:58] <javalover> so how do I clear that?
[10:39:59] <shoky> javalover: i donno, sounds that way
[10:40:04] <javalover> b.empty()?
[10:40:04] <shoky> javalover: b.empty()
[10:40:06] <javalover> kk
[10:40:53] <jeffsmykil> Anyone have any experience with an aspnet servcie saying the date time its getting sent in the ajax is 4 hours later than you are sending?
[10:41:38] <shoky> o.O

[10:41:40] <anew> ajpiano just the page in general.. just to see what does what... like the 'next' button on the bottom for example took me 45 minutes to figure out XS XS
[10:41:50] <ajpiano> anew: but then the plugiin calls the custom, app-specific handleres defined in the confi
[10:41:53] <ajpiano> config*
[10:41:56] <ajpiano> anew: http://cl.ly/38243o3m451e0D2P2t0j
[10:41:58] <anew> and if it wasnt for the irc chat, i would have never figured it out
[10:41:59] <yedimind> jeffsmykil, time settings on the server?
[10:42:11] <ajpiano> i just put a breakpoint inside of the invalidHandler, and when i don't fill out anything, it gets called
[10:42:14] <ajpiano> and then the code stops
[10:42:15] <jeffsmykil> that's what I thought yedimind but they swear they didnt set it to utc
[10:42:18] <X-Raimo> what data should be responsed on jsonp?
[10:42:39] <javalover> ok imma reask this
[10:42:51] <anew> yeah but ajpiano how did u know to put it inside invalidhandler ? and where to find it?  what if there were 1000 lines of code here....
[10:43:21] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano is a javascript magician if you haven;t figured that out yet anew
[10:43:22] <javalover> var b = pageidcontent.clone(true);   onmouseup(   b.appendTo(pageidcontent);  )
[10:43:22] <shoky> X-Raimo: callback( yourJsonObject )
[10:43:26] <ajpiano> cause i read the code and if necessary, the documentation of the plugin?
[10:43:37] <ajpiano> anew: there's a lot of stuff to digest there
[10:43:39] <javalover> i've tried pageidcontent.empty();
[10:43:47] <shoky> X-Raimo: where callback is whatever the query string says it is
[10:43:48] <javalover> but i'm just confused chicken or egg here when do I empty?
[10:43:54] <Woet> g
[10:43:57] <anew> yeah and this is a beginners page !  if there is anything intermediate i'm screwed
[10:43:58] <ajpiano> anew: you need to know what tools are in the stack you're using
[10:44:09] <Saiko> My colorboxes open the link twice sometimes. Please help
[10:44:13] <X-Raimo> shoky: can you give me an example?
[10:44:23] <javalover> shoky please help everyone else before me k thx
[10:44:30] <ajpiano> anew: i think you'd learn more from actually trying to implement some basic jquery yourself than trying to like, jump at a complex plugin like it's a pinata
[10:44:30] <javalover> just saying imma be working on it :-)
[10:44:31] <X-Raimo> shoky: yourJsonObject - is JSONed data, right?
[10:44:34] <ajpiano> and start taking whacks at it
[10:44:40] <anew> lol
[10:44:52] <anew> probably right... but i need to know how the console works tho dont it
[10:44:53] <ajpiano> cause like, the way "you know" what to debug in your app
[10:44:55] <anew> *dont i
[10:44:56] <shoky> X-Raimo:  http://jsfiddle.net/fwMSF/2/  look at your network tab and take a look at the response of the JSONP calls
[10:44:56] <ajpiano> is that you just WROTE the code
[10:45:03] <ajpiano> so you understand what *should* be happening
[10:45:06] <anew> yeah true
[10:45:09] <anew> tht's true
[10:45:11] <ajpiano> and then you know where it isn't happening, so you go debug there
[10:45:15] <cusco> hey... using <li class='ui-state-default'> .. their *width* is sometimes too short...
[10:45:17] <Saiko> What's wrong with this code: http://pastebin.com/psiLitZC ?
[10:45:18] <cusco> should I change this directly in css, or what should I do ?
[10:45:34] <shoky> X-Raimo: yes its a JSON object
[10:45:36] <ajpiano> anew: also it's really helpful to use the "break on uncaught exceptions" setting of the chrome dev tools
[10:45:44] <shoky> X-Raimo:  jQuery172023966487380675972_1340646316871({"text": "some text2", "par1": "another text2", "_": "1340646316878"});
[10:45:47] <ajpiano> this way when a functon breaks,it will pause the debugger inside of it
[10:46:32] <anew> ok
[10:46:46] <X-Raimo> shoky: 172023966487380675972_1340646316871 - how this is generated?
[10:46:59] <anew> the best thing i ever found was break on attributes modification.... but there is nothing similar to that if there are no attributes that are breaking!
[10:47:02] <ajpiano> anew: also look up paul irish's talks about chrome dev tools http://paulirish.com/2011/a-re-introduction-to-the-chrome-developer-tools/
[10:47:14] <ajpiano> anew: there are Event Listener Breakpoints
[10:47:16] <ajpiano> but you can't get a callstack
[10:47:18] <shoky> !
[10:47:27] <ajpiano> so you get buried deep in lib code and can't figure out what fired it
[10:47:36] <shoky> ajpiano: how do you turn that setting on? (break on uncaught exceptions)
[10:47:47] <anew> yeah exactly... ajpiano i was hoping there was something better than event listener breakpoints
[10:47:58] <javalover> *sigh* anyone know how to empty properly?
[10:48:11] <javalover> ya know what I could do is just set a boolean
[10:48:14] <javalover> and make it only copy the first time...
[10:48:26] <shoky> javalover: you're appending a clone of a div, into itself ?
[10:48:34] <javalover> haha yeah
[10:48:39] <javalover> when you put it that way that's exactly what i'm doing
[10:48:41] <Dr-Bombay> javalover: sit on the toilet and relax
[10:49:27] <ajpiano> anew: what's "better" is understanding how a js app flows
[10:49:32] <ajpiano> from writing one a bit
[10:50:03] <Saiko> What's wrong with this code: http://pastebin.com/psiLitZC ? Colorbox is opening twice on the second click, and three times on the third click
[10:50:14] <ajpiano> and understanding things like how jquery plugins "generally" work...so that you know like, ok... document ready function... select elements, attach plugin, which does its thing and then calls the custom config stuff you attach
[10:50:35] <Brodingo> oh my
[10:50:54] <shoky> javalover: var b = pageidcontent.clone(true);   onmouseup(  pageidcontent.empty().append(b)  )
[10:51:15] <anew> yep... true, was hoping for an easy way out
[10:51:19] <shoky> javalover: why are you appending it into itself tho :\
[10:51:55] <shoky> javalover: sure you don't maybe want pageidcontent.replaceWith(b) ?
[10:52:06] <javalover> that sounds awesome
[10:52:07] <javalover> lets do that
[10:52:54] <javalover> I love you shoky
[10:53:02] <javalover> I love you <---------------------------------------------------------------------> MUCH!

[10:55:25] <javalover> man i've been building this site for a long time now....but i'm starting to see results
[10:55:30] <shoky> ajpiano: ohh it's that little pause button?? jeez how could i have overlooked that
[10:55:37] <javalover> sites like this are really hard in beginning but in the end ur like "oh wow look at what I can do"
[10:55:41] <ajpiano> shoky: ya, sry
[10:56:28] <jeffsmykil> ajpiano: you'd be so proud of me I built another widget
[10:56:32] <ajpiano> :))
[10:56:35] <javalover> ok now here's a fun question
[10:56:39] <tomasm-> hi, i'm noticing with using sortable that contains a tinymce editor in each, that once the item is dropped, the tinymce content box goes blank (its okay as it's dragging)... any ideas how to solve this? it may need to be redrawn, but not sure how
[10:56:58] <javalover> ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm eff
[10:57:09] <shoky> fun!
[10:57:16] <javalover> it's just hard to explain
[10:57:22] <shoky> no fun
[10:57:48] <javalover> okay so i'm doing this copy inside a button
[10:58:08] <javalover> and my question is...later on in my code I create other buttons that do it as well
[10:58:26] <shoky> explain the first sentence 1st
[10:58:32] <javalover> kk
[10:58:41] <javalover> so I have like 3 buttons inside a div
[10:58:53] <shoky> fiddle is also fun
[10:58:56] <javalover> the first button i'm going to click which will load the content of the next page
[10:59:11] <javalover> but I want to include the events found in the other 2 buttons on the next page
[10:59:18] <Tokae> hello everyone
[10:59:40] <javalover> the problem is i'm coding the event for the first button b4 I code the next 2
[10:59:52] <javalover> so how can I include them in the transfer?
[11:00:22] <Tokae> I am probably overlooking something simple, but I have a form that the user fills in, they click a submit button, and I would like the info in the form to be inserted into my db and not have the page they are on change..
[11:00:47] <Tokae> everything works, except the page changes to my php page with the insert
[11:00:48] <shoky> javalover can you fiddle it :\
[11:00:52] <javalover> essentially b1.mouseup(copy all of div) <-- but this is a problem cuz b2 and b3 don't exist yet
[11:00:54] <Tokae> so the user sees a blank whit epage.
[11:01:28] <Tokae> any ideas why the page loads? I am using $.ajax to POST the data to my other php page
[11:01:43] <javalover> so how can I go b1.mouseup(copy stuff that i'm going to code later on);
[11:01:51] <shoky> Tokae: when does the page change..?
[11:01:56] <tomasm-> Tokae, you probably aren't stopping the default handler... you need to call e.preventDefault() within your event (assuming 'e' is the event object)
[11:02:01] <Tokae> after its inserted the new data into the table
[11:02:02] <shoky> ^^
[11:02:19] <Tokae> ok I will check that out!
[11:02:21] <Tokae> thank you
[11:02:48] <javalover> or wait maybe it does copy
[11:03:06] <javalover> my brain just is wired to believe it doesn't
[11:03:07] <shoky> javalover i didnt understnd your question at all
[11:03:17] <javalover> cuz i'm gonig $("#mydiv").copy()
[11:03:34] <javalover> but I'm doing it on b1.mouseup()
[11:03:43] <javalover> and I haven't added in b2.mouseup();  I code that after b1
[11:03:59] <javalover> so i was thinking it wouldn't copy the events for b2 & b3 only for b1.
[11:04:06] <javalover> but now i think i'm wrong
[11:04:09] <javalover> cuz it's a finder function
[11:04:12] <javalover> so it will copy it
[11:04:20] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/pBdrs/
[11:04:38] <shoky> your turn
[11:04:52] <javalover> haha I go upper right one sec
[11:05:43] <javalover> umm k but i never use buttons
[11:05:45] <javalover> how you give an id?
[11:06:01] <tomasm-> javalover, you can generalize an event handler by using on(), that will work for objects that don't yet exist
[11:06:34] <javalover> hmm i still wanna fiddle this imma change it lol
[11:06:35] <shoky> javalover: id's are given to all elements in the same way
[11:06:46] <javalover> yeah but mine is showing up in red for whatever reason
[11:06:57] <javalover> lol
[11:06:58] <shoky> in the fiddle? fuck that
[11:07:02] <tomasm-> javalover, event handlers dont get designated for an object that doesn't exist prior to the assignment. that's what on() fixes
[11:07:03] <shoky> dont trust it ;>
[11:07:05] <javalover> i put it before the button no
[11:07:05] <javalover> it's fine
[11:07:06] <javalover> it was my mistake lol
[11:07:13] <javalover> i put like <id = "sdf" button
[11:07:17] <javalover> which is wrong i fixed it
[11:10:18] <cusco> I'm using $( "#insideList, #sortable2" ).sortable - and <li class='ui-state-default'>, but the li width is too short
[11:10:33] <cusco> if I set it to auto, after sorting, it reverts back
[11:10:42] <cusco> to 132px
[11:12:44] <shoky> cusco can you jsfiddle it
[11:13:03] <javalover> ok shoky I have somehting it is broken but
[11:13:05] <javalover> http://jsfiddle.net/pBdrs/4/
[11:13:13] <javalover> if you push clone thing
[11:13:23] <javalover> I want it so when you push clone back it brings it back
[11:13:36] <javalover> I think solution would be to make it a variable outside scope
[11:13:54] <javalover> but i'm still confused this is what i'm referring to like having events within the buttons outside of creating them.
[11:14:19] <javalover> that would work though lets see i try outside scope
[11:14:26] <javalover> hard to explain what i'm asking for but essentially this is it
[11:14:44] <shoky> dude
[11:14:56] <shoky> mystuff.empty();  mystuff.replaceWith(b);
[11:15:12] <shoky> you're emptying the container, and then replacing the container with a button ?
[11:15:40] <shoky> (just making sure..)
[11:16:03] <javalover> yeah so basically what's happening is this
[11:16:05] <javalover> I have 3 links
[11:16:15] <javalover> in the new container I want those 3 same links to exist
[11:16:17] <javalover> same way they were before
[11:16:25] <javalover> and just transfer them back & forth
[11:16:42] <javalover> but i'm trying to show an example like ok fine just remove the links & then bring them back
[11:16:47] <javalover> if I can see how that works I can code this
[11:16:57] <cusco> ow, I found out
[11:18:01] <javalover> also like on some pages i'm going to reformat how the links appear
[11:18:06] <javalover> but I want them to still work exactly same way
[11:19:10] <shoky> javalover: why clone and replace? why not just hide and show different containers?
[11:19:41] <javalover> that's a thought that did cross my mind
[11:19:52] <javalover> but idk I like the cloning idea
[11:20:03] <javalover> currently i'm doing the hiding one but I just tried this clone thing
[11:20:10] <javalover> and it was like "wow that's awesome" lets do that
[11:20:29] <javalover> it just seems like it would be a lot less code to clone it
[11:20:55] <shoky> if you don't have a special reason for cloning
[11:20:57] <shoky> then don't
[11:21:03] <javalover> can I atleast copy how the button works
[11:21:18] <javalover> like the event for it & reattach it
[11:21:22] <shoky> you want the 'clone back' to appear before there's been a replace..?
[11:21:36] <javalover> no the problem is this
[11:21:54] <javalover> in my code right now i'm creating a new link via   newHtml = newHtml + "<a href>";
[11:22:08] <javalover> and then I have to have an event handler for that ahref
[11:22:32] <javalover> but I don't want to constantly make new ones I just want the existing one
[11:23:22] <shoky> donno what you mean, but probably using .on and delegating the event handling to a container element is what you want
[11:23:23] <javalover> so one idea i had is like just copy all the links over
[11:23:43] <javalover> is there an example of this?
[11:23:53] <javalover> some reading material?
[11:23:58] <shoky> here's how to do it with just show/hide btw... http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/pBdrs/8/
[11:25:03] <shoky> if you use event delegation then you won't need to set up a new event handler each time you create a new link
[11:25:11] <javalover> haha yeah shoky that is fine for show/hide but mine is a bit complex
[11:25:23] <shoky> event delegation then
[11:25:24] <javalover> serious?
[11:25:27] <shoky> very
[11:25:28] <javalover> hows that work?
[11:25:33] <javalover> do i like assign based on id?
[11:25:34] <javalover> or something?
[11:25:49] <javalover> that sounds pretty cool if I can just attach the event
[11:25:52] <javalover> to the href
[11:26:01] <shoky> something like:  $('#staticContainerElement').on('mouseup', 'a.someClass', function() { .... });
[11:26:08] <Whirl3d> so using the .load method to load conten into a div should also load the necessary scripts included in the header of the page being loaded, right?
[11:26:16] <shoky> where the container element is already in the DOM when you're calling that
[11:26:29] <javalover> ohhh I get it
[11:26:34] <javalover> ohhhhhhhh
[11:26:36] <javalover> oh i'm such a noob
[11:26:37] <shoky> and assuming your <a>s have someClass class
[11:26:45] <javalover> yeah yeah I got that
[11:26:48] <javalover> see this was my issue
[11:26:58] <javalover> ok ok
[11:27:02] <javalover> no i see that
[11:27:03] <shoky> but , read about event delegation, see ?on
[11:27:03] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:27:22] <javalover> ok so this goes to the container and not to the object itself then?
[11:27:39] <javalover> and then anything in container with that class will have that event?
[11:27:40] <shoky> yes, but the 'a.someClass' means it'll trigger only when you mouseup on those <a>
[11:27:53] <javalover> i could also do id right?
[11:27:58] <shoky> sure, any selector
[11:28:05] <javalover> but it attaches to the container
[11:28:06] <javalover> that's awesome
[11:28:10] <shoky> aye
[11:28:25] <javalover> and why would I ever change the container & want something with same class to do something different
[11:28:28] <javalover> correct?
[11:28:35] <shoky> hmm what?
[11:28:43] <javalover> just thinking why I would not want to do it that way
[11:29:08] <javalover> and only thing I can think of is if I change container & then also want same class to have different effect on button
[11:29:09] <javalover> but even if that was the case
[11:29:10] <javalover> i would just call
[11:29:15] <shoky> well if you have some button that is in the DOM on page load, and you want to handle clicks on it
[11:29:16] <javalover> $('#staticContainerElement').on('mouseup', 'a.someClass', function() { .... });
[11:29:18] <javalover> on that load
[11:29:21] <shoky> you dont necessarily need event delegation
[11:29:30] <javalover> i like event delegation though
[11:29:32] <javalover> ur a bo$$ shoky!
[11:29:34] <shoky> then use it ;p
[11:29:41] <shoky> ;[
[11:29:42] <shoky> er
[11:29:42] <shoky> ;]
[11:30:18] <javalover> is this how twitter does that stuff with all the tweets?
[11:30:30] <javalover> where like you expand/contract any tweet & it works same for every single one?
[11:30:33] <shoky> not a tweeter, no idea ;>
[11:30:39] <javalover> haha ok well
[11:30:43] <javalover> if anything this is awesome
[11:31:00] <shoky> but anywhere where you have a lot of elements you wanna handle events on, it's probably nicer to use delegation
[11:31:13] <shoky> so twitter most likely does it in some form too, yes :P
[11:32:52] <MysterOnyx> on AJAX success I want to loop through each json object... I have been doing a for loop like this: for(y=0;y<data.length; y++), however I can't do data.length since we're dealing with objects, right?
[11:33:39] <someprimetime> you could do $.each(data, function(index, value) { console.log(this.value); });
[11:33:48] <MysterOnyx> ah yes, that'll work better
[11:33:51] <MysterOnyx> thanks
[11:33:53] <someprimetime> np
[11:35:33] <javalover> bout to test this
[11:36:45] <javalover> omg
[11:36:49] <javalover> marry me shoky!
[11:36:55] <MysterOnyx> lol
[11:37:02] <javalover> he's such a beast
[11:37:04] <javalover> holy shit
[11:37:12] <javalover> saved me sooo much work just now
[11:37:17] <javalover> event delegation ftw!
[11:38:06] <shoky> ;]
[11:38:09] <thomedy> quick question..... i was recommended hashchange plugin by benalman im using it and it works but how reliable is it accross the browsers and by the older browsers
[11:38:12] <thomedy> it works fine now
[11:38:34] <shoky> i can test ie8 for you if you wish ;p
[11:38:34] <thomedy> but as bad as machine is there are worse out there and i would like as much of a customer base as possible
[11:38:49] <thomedy> shoky talking > me
[11:38:55] <shoky> yyyyes
[11:39:16] <thomedy> that would be delightfull and i appreciate it but im talking a bit further back
[11:39:21] <thomedy> how many people still use 6
[11:39:25] <thomedy> and what about opera
[11:39:30] <thomedy> because onUnload doesn't work in opera
[11:39:44] <shoky> don't consider 6, PLEASE
[11:39:47] <thomedy> i know i was going to write my own and i saw abunch of things that said stuff
[11:39:49] <javalover> dude fuck explorer, on my site if you come with explorer it gives  you a link to firefox & says "DOWNLOAD IT OR GTFO"
[11:40:06] <thomedy> i just want as much customers as i can and i hate ie
[11:40:17] <thomedy> but isnt it my job to make this site as successful as i can
[11:40:48] <javalover> define success, if that person is dumb enough to still be using I.E.  *sigh* actually they probably would buy something from ur site
[11:41:00] <thomedy> i dont know how many people have 6 anymore but i cant be so elitist to say that people with ie 6 are so retarded to use  6 so theres no way to keep a job and thus pay for my product
[11:41:06] <mindyou> hi there
[11:41:09] <NoiseEee> thomedy:  you should probably use http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[11:41:17] <shoky> ;>
[11:41:47] <javalover> dude that sounds so awesome, I bookmarked it!
[11:41:47] <Whirl3d> lolol
[11:41:51] <thomedy> javalover thats kind of jacked up i didnt say anything rude to u ever
[11:42:14] <mindyou> I'm trying to use unobtrusive validation on a form, but it doesn't seem to validate blank fields. what am I missing?
[11:44:15] <thomedy> oh and second question / comment.. mostly question is there a stack of urls i can pull from because it looks as though when back and forward are pressed they just increment or decrement a pointer on the addresses
[11:44:24] <thomedy> so im wondering if i have access to that stack in javascript
[11:48:06] <kenperkins> anyone here maintain a bookmarklet?
[11:48:39] <javalover> you know you have a dope site when you start to question the registry
[11:49:16] <thomedy> what do you mean by registry?

[11:51:03] <ajpiano> but will prob hang after or something
[11:51:13] <javalover> like the memory
[11:51:24] <javalover> questioning like "how many var's can javascript hold?"
[11:51:27] <thomedy> thank you but i mean what is it remembering
[11:51:33] <thomedy> okay thank you
[11:51:55] <javalover> it just means ur content is going to grow at such an amazing rate
[11:51:59] <javalover> that ur afraid it could break the site lol
[11:52:12] <thomedy> ah that sounds dope and also sucky
[11:55:17] <granden> If I got a few things I want to be runned during a mouse hover. How can I protect those? its some animations etc.
[11:55:42] <granden> By protect I acctually not meant protect I rather meant, so when hovering another image should not run the new actions before the old one is complete.
[11:56:45] <phpAdam> hi, I know this is not so much related to jquery, but its about uploadify which is using jquery :) i guess you guys are the closest i can get to some help.
[11:57:26] <phpAdam> so im trying to upload a file with uploadify, but once the upload is finished, the target server is redirecting to a URL which has the video id in it, how do i fetch that URL after the upload has been done?
[11:58:42] <saulotoledo> hello all! Can I put the load result inside a variable instead a html element? $('#myElement').load('myUrl.html')
[11:58:54] <jedahan> is there a better way to do 'onHold = (e) -> $(document.elementFromPoint(e.pageX, e.pageY)).click())'
[12:00:13] <shoky> jedahan: when is that triggered?
[12:03:27] <Whirl3d> does typeof return the item's prototype name or should I just check the prototype property?
[12:04:22] <Whirl3d> or is it constructor...?
[12:04:38] <thomedy> oh thats awesome firing an animation based on hash change on not on clicks i love learning
[12:04:47] <shoky> typeof doesn't give you much except 'object' or 'function'
[12:10:38] <bjonnh> Hi there
[12:10:56] <Whirl3d> so if I have elementa={controller:something, props:someprops} and I store a reference to that in an elements data object like $(elem).data("controller", elementa);   can I access "something" like   var something=$(elem).data(controller.controller); ?
[12:11:21] <thomedy> dude whirl3d it already has so much more robust behavior
[12:11:30] <thomedy> i have a front page again that links back to the 25% divs
[12:11:33] <thomedy> im so psyched
[12:11:39] <Whirl3d> 8)
[12:12:24] <bjonnh> How can I get values from an ajax call to be used for the initialization of an object (a select2 object in this case) ?
[12:12:30] <bjonnh> I have this : https://gist.github.com/4dc4e0910b0622165e9f
[12:12:56] <bjonnh> that's fine, I can get the ajax value, but as the call is asynchronous, I can't get the values in the data array
[12:13:31] <bjonnh> (fyi this function is the initSelection parameter of my select2)
[12:15:58] <thomedy> okay heres a question....
[12:17:15] <Saiko> Help colorbox will not properly close
[12:17:59] <thomedy> nm i put it in the wrong conditional im good again
[12:23:48] <nobitanobi> How can I get an <iframe> element inside a div with id X?
[12:24:04] <systemfault> You should learn CSS...

[12:25:30] <r3v3rb> hi if I have a json call returning each element as [Object { name="Quen farin", score="35925", device="Sony Ericsson MT11i"}, Object { name="Im da best", score="32800", device="iPhone"} how do I access the items? I tried data.name but I get undefined
[12:26:09] <systemfault> r3v3rb: It's an array so.. data[0].name and data[1].name
[12:26:31] <r3v3rb> perfect thanks, will try now :D
[12:26:59] <r3v3rb> ewww, actually was trying to use .each not a for loop...
[12:27:05] <thomedy> im almost there im jsut trying to think of a solid conditional to check for which slide i should be on ...
[12:27:17] <r3v3rb> will have to change the code to a simple loop then :D
[12:27:56] <systemfault> :)
[12:28:41] <bjonnh> got it (after 1 day!)
[12:29:27] <systemfault> Feels good? :P
[12:29:45] <nobitanobi> I see the #document in my console when doing this: https://gist.github.com/2990719 — but the click event is not beging triggered when clicking on the iframe. Any thoughts?
[12:35:00] <Dr-Bombay> nobitanobi: set the event on the iframe document, not the iframe
[12:35:34] <Dr-Bombay> iframe does not have events
[12:38:20] <bjonnh> systemfault: yep !
[12:41:58] <nobitanobi> Dr-Bombay: I am setting in the document
[12:43:58] <dmcardle> Does anybody know why only the dynamic components of a form would not be POSTed?
[12:47:36] <chilversc> dmcardle: because either they are not inside the form, or they are not "successful" controls
[12:47:53] <chilversc> dmcardle: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.2
[12:49:45] <Aut0Exec> is there an alternative jquery plugin site? it seems down
[12:50:34] <dmcardle> chilversc: When I call serialize() on the form, everything shows up.  Would that not imply that they are successful controls?
[12:51:34] <chilversc> dmcardle: probably, it would seem so outside of a bug in serialize
[12:52:12] <chilversc> dmcardle: though note, how it states "name" not "id"
[12:52:45] <fission6> i am building a small rating system - i have a ul with li's in it (obviously) when the user hovers over an li i want those to the left to be one image and those to the right be another
[12:53:26] <dmcardle> chilversc: I give the inputs unique ids and names that are shared among members of the group (dealing with checkboxes). It's the strangest thing.
[12:54:01] <chilversc> that does seem odd
[12:56:06] <dmcardle> chilversc: Ah, I guess I'll just POST with a $.ajax() call using the serialize() function then
[12:57:55] <chilversc> dmcardle: so previously you were using .submit() or a standard button to trigger submit?
[13:01:34] <fission6> anyone have any ideas how i can turn this into a rating system where all symblings to the right become bold when an object is hovered over and all to the left become unbold, http://jsfiddle.net/BU9bM/
[13:03:48] <fission6> looks like prevAll could help
[13:05:35] <ravenzz> fission6 that's correct
[13:06:26] <ravenzz> i'd use radio buttons btw
[13:06:47] <ravenzz> wrappend in a form that can be submitted if js is not working
[13:07:19] <dmcardle> chilversc: I was using no javascript, just standard html with action=... and method="POST" to submit the form
[13:07:30] <ravenzz> fission6 http://jsfiddle.net/BU9bM/1/
[13:10:23] <fission6> thanks ravenzz will review

[13:30:36] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone
[13:30:53] <jarr0dsz> what would be a good way to have 2 submit buttons have a state based on the button you click and submit + call a custom function ;)
[13:31:01] <jarr0dsz> pretty much mess i have to do within a simple function
[13:38:52] <t0nic> where can I find a list of the events that jquery recognizes?
[13:39:00] <t0nic> I found "paste" somewhere and it made me curious
[13:40:59] <sh0ne> Any way to know if $.getJSON() failed?
[13:44:49] <pifantastic> sh0ne: yes, attach an .error() callback to the jxhr object
[13:44:58] <pifantastic> plenty of examples @ http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[13:46:18] <sh0ne> pifantastic: you mean like ' jxhr.error(function() { alert("error"); }) ' ?
[13:46:31] <pifantastic> sh0ne: right
[13:46:39] <pifantastic> but please don't actually use window.alert :)
[13:47:00] <sh0ne> thank you, pifantastic for your help :)
[13:47:01] <tw2113> console.log() is your friend
[13:47:19] <tw2113> and if you're not using one of the inspector tools available, wtf
[13:54:27] <fission6> how can i insert an element n times
[13:57:20] <catcher> fission6, you should probably build an array of the elements in a for loop and append them all at once.
[14:03:34] <psyolus> Is it possible to reference the instance of an object in the object's prototype?
[14:26:46] <someprimetime> would it be better to use html5 drag and drop or jquery ui drag drop? this is a site that pretty much supports all major browsers but we still support ie8+
[14:36:52] <hiall> Anyone help me with the grep function, http://jsfiddle.net/WTydr/ - trying to get it to work with multidimentional objects
[14:38:19] <Dr-Bombay> hiall: so what are you expecting back from that call
[14:40:33] <hiall> Dr-Bombay: I am hoping to remove the array item with dd && jj@jj ans return the rest...
[14:41:29] <imissmyjuno> then\ it works as desired
[14:41:33] <Dr-Bombay> shouldn't you assign to object.users intead
[14:42:26] <hiall> that would help :D
[14:42:29] <hiall> thanks Dr-Bombay
[15:01:09] <sh0ne> Guys, I want to check if RSS Subscription extension for Google Chrome is installed or not. I made a script http://jsfiddle.net/FPwCB/ , it successfully detects whether the browser is Chrome or not but fail to detect if the RSS Subscription extension is installled (always gives message "RSS plugin is NOT installed!"). What I am doing wrong?
[15:03:59] <sh0ne> When I try to manually check for that url everything is ok (when the extension is installed the url is valid; when it is not installed the url is invalid).
[15:11:07] <mzarella> https://gist.github.com/f61ee810933bb83bccfa
[15:11:17] <mzarella> what is wrong with this?
[15:12:46] <mzarella> i'm doing my best to show bFetchError after bFetching is hidden
[15:13:11] <mzarella> preferably in the same div but i'll be happy just to get the timing right
[15:13:33] <mzarella> right now the error pops up immediately after the function at beforeSend:
[15:13:38] <jenia> hello everyone
[15:13:40] <mzarella> method i mean
[15:13:56] <jenia> i have a call back and inside it i do: this.style.color="blabla"
[15:14:08] <jenia> but its doesnt change the property
[15:14:17] <johnkpaul> mzarella: delay does not do what you think it does
[15:14:19] <johnkpaul> ?delay @mzarella
[15:14:21] <bot-t> mzarella, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[15:14:25] <jenia> after this line executes, the this.style.color is still ""
[15:14:40] <catcher> mzarella, setTimeout is probably what you're after
[15:15:05] <catcher> jenia, 'this' may no longer refer to what you're hoping for..
[15:15:31] <Dr-Bombay> jenia: what are you passing the callback to
[15:15:51] <jenia> the click function
[15:16:00] <jenia> query_set.click(function()...
[15:16:35] <Dr-Bombay> jenia: what is "blabla"
[15:16:48] <jenia> its the color
[15:16:54] <jenia> eca777
[15:17:16] <Dr-Bombay> show me the exact string with the quotes
[15:18:05] <jenia> obj.currentTarget.style.color="eca777";
[15:18:15] <Dr-Bombay> that's not a color
[15:18:17] <jenia> obj is the argument to the function and its equal to "this"
[15:18:23] <jenia> what is that?
[15:18:27] <catcher> jenia, it's a string
[15:19:14] <jenia> i dont get it. how do i need to specify these characters?
[15:19:28] <johnkpaul> mzarella: yeah, use setTimeout as catcher said or look into the _.delay function from underscorejs
[15:20:16] <Dr-Bombay> "#eca777" is a color
[15:21:43] <jenia> ahhhh okay
[15:21:44] <jenia> haha
[15:21:48] <jenia> thank you so very much
[15:41:46] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/P9Src/2/

[15:41:54] <RohanBhangui> but
[15:42:06] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/P9Src/4/
[15:42:08] <RohanBhangui> updated
[15:42:22] <RohanBhangui> how come i dont get 6 set of values?
[15:43:14] <karolyi> hi, thi may be a little offtopic, but does anyone know aCDN where i can host shitloads of images?
[15:43:47] <johnkpaul> karolyi: akamai?
[15:45:10] <karolyi> well, i'm thinking at google picasa, it's free, dunno if it is allowed to use it as an image CDN though
[15:45:59] <johnkpaul> well there's dropbox's public dir
[15:46:07] <johnkpaul> neither are "CDN"s in the classic sense though
[15:48:12] <jehe> <input type="text" name="name"> can I use name in jquery calls and such or do I have to give it an ID or class?
[15:49:29] <karolyi> johnkpaul: https://fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/166961_10150559197939653_1916366752_n.jpg
[15:49:33] <Eviltwin> jehe: You can, it's just not as fast to look up and has a longer selector
[15:49:49] <Eviltwin> jehe: $('input[name="name"]')
[15:51:10] <johnkpaul> :) karolyi,cloud front then?
[15:54:01] <BarelyConfused> Anyone with rooting experience?
[15:54:35] <karolyi> johnkpaul: actually, i'm working on an opensource forum of mine, and looking for a free hosting network for it, as i'm low on disk space for pictures... i found cloudflare which is free, but i need to tweak my domain for that solution, so i decided not to use it
[15:54:56] <johnkpaul> if it's open source, you can put it onto github pages
[15:54:59] <johnkpaul> ?g github pages @ karolyi
[15:55:00] <bot-t> karolyi, GitHub Pages - http://pages.github.com/
[15:55:31] <karolyi> johnkpaul: https://github.com/karolyi/Forum :)
[15:56:33] <johnkpaul> good, so you can use ghpages
[15:59:02] <karolyi> i may be foolish but i don't see how i could use this as an image cdn
[16:04:36] <bemson> is there a way to .empty() without removing event listeners?
[16:04:57] <donnaR> hey jq how do I retrieve the response from an ajax request that went wrong
[16:05:10] <bemson> or, is there a batch .remove() method which accepts an array of target child elements?
[16:05:31] <karolyi> bemson: use live()
[16:05:40] <Eviltwin> No
[16:05:42] <Eviltwin> Never use live()
[16:05:45] <Eviltwin> live() is deprecated
[16:06:12] <bemson> karolyi: the child elements have their own listeners, I'm not using a delegate
[16:06:26] <Eviltwin> bemson: The error handler gets three args
[16:06:30] <Eviltwin> Err
[16:06:33] <Eviltwin> donnaR: The error handler gets three args
[16:06:42] <Eviltwin> donnaR: The first is the jqXHR object
[16:06:45] <jehe> can I do something like this? if($('.ssnerror').css('visibility', 'visible')) If the css attribut visibility is set to visible do this
[16:06:57] <bemson> could I send an array of elements to .remove()?
[16:06:59] <Eviltwin> Of which you can access the .responseText property for the data
[16:07:06] <bemson> would it accept it the same as a jQuery object?
[16:07:06] <Eviltwin> bemson: Have you done much jQuery before?
[16:07:14] <bemson> Eviltwin: nope
[16:07:28] <donnaR> ok thanks Eviltwin
[16:07:28] <Eviltwin> bemson: Take a look at the example here: http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[16:07:48] <bemson> fair enough, thought I could get an answer here
[16:07:58] <shoky> jehe:  if ( $('.ssnerror').css('visibility') == 'visible' )
[16:08:03] <jehe> I see
[16:08:09] <Eviltwin> While you could get an answer here, we prefer people try to help themselves via the API first
[16:08:33] <Eviltwin> It means there's less noise in here for questions whose answers are explained throughly in docs already
[16:09:22] <bemson> Eviltwin: there is no mention of whether .remove() accepts an array of dom references, as opposed to a jQuery object/collection
[16:09:39] <Eviltwin> ...
[16:10:03] <bemson> Eviltwin: that's my question - unless you want me to help myself further, by testing it out
[16:10:09] <Eviltwin> bemson: The first example shows it removing two elements in one line
[16:10:16] <Eviltwin> Please refer to the example as I asked you to
[16:10:43] <sacho_> Bemmu, wat?
[16:10:46] <sacho_> Bemmu, sorry
[16:10:48] <sacho_> bemson, wat?
[16:10:51] <bemson> Eviltwin: I think we're done :-|
[16:11:02] <Eviltwin> If you're asking if remove can accept an array of DOM elements as an argument, no
[16:11:03] <sacho_> how would you "send" an array of dom elements to .remove?
[16:11:12] <sacho_> remove is a method of jquery objects
[16:11:15] <bemson> sacho_: can I send a standard array of dom elements to .remove()?
[16:11:31] <Eviltwin> I'm baffled by this
[16:11:34] <bemson> .remove(arrayOfDomNodes)
[16:11:36] <Eviltwin> He clearly doesn't understand what remove does
[16:11:38] <sacho_> no
[16:11:41] <bemson> sacho_: thx
[16:11:42] <sacho_> the first parameter is a selector
[16:11:46] <sacho_> not an array of dom nodes
[16:11:50] <Eviltwin> Even though it's explained on the page
[16:11:53] <bemson> sacho_: claro
[16:12:02] <sacho_> what you're looking for is $(arrayOfDomNodes).remove()
[16:12:16] <bemson> sacho_: perfect, thanks again
[16:12:48] * sacho_ sends stuff around.
[16:13:27] <donnaR> does js sets your Content-Type to application/xxx-form...  automatically, I'm trying to set it on mp4 and it fails
[16:13:51] <Eviltwin> donnaR: Are you doing an upload form or something?
[16:14:09] <donnaR> yes
[16:14:20] <donnaR> using $.ajax
[16:14:44] <donnaR> the content-type gets changed and i get unsupported format
[16:14:45] <Eviltwin> I believe upload forms only work with a multipart form
[16:16:50] <jehe> Is it possible to this? http://jsfiddle.net/rJKbZ/
[16:16:54] <jehe> I cant get it to work
[16:17:49] <jehe> am trying to fade in the .ssnerror
[16:17:57] <Eviltwin> Try .fadeIn()
[16:18:07] <jehe> that requires display:hidden right?
[16:18:13] <jehe> I want the hidden element to take up room
[16:18:23] <jehe> therefor I chose visibility
[16:19:01] <donnaR> Eviltwin, well I try to set the header content-type to multipart but I must be doing something wrong
[16:19:40] <donnaR> do I pass the headers with the data to an ajax request like data:headers+data, or content_type:content
[16:21:03] <Eviltwin> jehe: I think you want this: http://jsfiddle.net/yyGaA/
[16:21:33] <jehe> thanks for your time, but I really wanted this
[16:21:33] <jehe> $('.ssnerror').css('visibility','visible').hide().fadeIn('slow');

[16:55:04] * ryanneufeld bear hugs coldhead
[16:55:06] <RealityBall> hello so is there a way I can get the number of the element when its clicked so like lets say I have an eventhandler foo.click(function{}{ return which element was clicked on}) where foo is a class containing more than one elements?
[16:55:40] <robert_> so is it possible to capture a click event on an anchor?
[16:55:59] <ryanneufeld> robert_: yes
[16:56:24] <robert_> ryuone_: okay, then my click-handler isn't functioning correctly. :/
[16:56:29] <ryanneufeld> RealityBall: when you say the number of the element, what do you mean?
[16:56:33] <coldhead> RealityBall: its generally better to operate on `this` which is the element which is clicked, than to add some bogus counting schema
[16:56:50] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: no love today?

[16:57:20] <robert_> coldhead: I operate on the (e)
[16:57:32] <RealityBall> ryanneufeld: like for instance lets say you put all elements with that number in an array, I want the value of the number of that array
[16:57:34] <jehe> coldhead can javascript really do that?
[16:57:35] <jehe> am not so sure
[16:57:45] <ryanneufeld> RealityBall: you want the index?
[16:57:49] <RealityBall> yeah
[16:57:55] <coldhead> i am not sure either, jehe, it's my first day using javascript
[16:58:05] <jehe> ooookay
[16:58:10] <RealityBall> can I do $(this).index or something?
[16:58:16] <RealityBall> is there such a method?
[16:58:32] <coldhead> ?index @ RealityBall
[16:58:32] <bot-t> RealityBall, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[16:58:42] <coldhead> there is but it doesn't do what you want
[16:58:59] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ robert_
[16:59:00] <bot-t> robert_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:59:01] <RealityBall> oh well what is the method which does what I want?
[16:59:42] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @RealityBall
[16:59:43] <bot-t> RealityBall, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:00:36] <brl0> this works as expected: $('body').append($('<a hef="#one">5555555</a>'), $('<a hef="#one">6666666</a>'));
[17:00:52] <brl0> I would like to do something similar to that, except a little more magical..
[17:01:02] <brl0> like $('body').append([array of $()])
[17:01:58] <ryanneufeld> brl0: you know you don't have to wrap them all in $()
[17:02:51] <brl0> yep, that was just a copy/paste on my part
[17:03:14] <ryanneufeld> ?append
[17:03:15] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[17:03:43] <brl0> I suppose my first question should be, is it more performant to append() all at once, or is jquery just iterating and attaching one at a time anyways?
[17:03:50] <gf3> I expect to see you all at Throne of JS
[17:03:53] <coldhead> RealityBall: this works (to my surprise) http://jsfiddle.net/b86qZ/
[17:04:13] <ryanneufeld> gf3: where/when is that?
[17:04:23] <dilvie> what is Throne of JS?
[17:04:24] <ryanneufeld> gf3: also, what is it?
[17:04:29] <gf3> ryanneufeld: http://throneofjs.com
[17:04:30] <gf3> dilvie: http://throneofjs.com
[17:04:31] <gf3> http://throneofjs.com
[17:04:39] <ryanneufeld> brl0: check the docs on append
[17:04:42] <Es0teric> how do i set a refresh timeout for $.getJSON?
[17:04:54] <coldhead> ?mdc setinterval @ Es0teric
[17:04:55] <bot-t> Es0teric, window.setInterval - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Calls a function repeatedly, with a fixed time delay between each call to that function. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.setInterval
[17:04:56] <RealityBall> coldhead: woah thanks man
[17:05:01] <brl0> i get a dom exception on $('body').append([$(), $()])
[17:05:20] <coldhead> you can't append an array of elements, brl0
[17:05:33] <coldhead> the magnificent ben nadel has some code to do that for you
[17:05:35] <coldhead> lemme find
[17:05:39] <Es0teric> so, coldhead... in $.getJSON, i can do $(this).setInterval()?
[17:05:54] <coldhead> brl0: http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2268-Appending-An-Array-Of-jQuery-Objects-To-The-DOM.htm ENJOY
[17:06:05] <robert_> nevermind. it was me being dumb. :D
[17:06:10] <brl0> how is that different from $('body').append($('body').find('.class').clone()) ?
[17:06:15] <brl0> thanks
[17:06:21] <coldhead> no Es0teric, i would wrap .getJSON in setInterval, which will call getJSON for you periodically
[17:06:59] <Es0teric> that makes sense
[17:07:21] <Es0teric> thanks, coldhead
[17:07:35] <ryanneufeld> brl0: its acually more performant to append them all into one string and then append once
[17:07:49] <ryanneufeld> brl0: there is a jsperf test for it somewhere
[17:07:51] <Murg|e> http://jsfiddle.net/n9vaD/1/ I've got a div toggle working for a php script that loops out a bunch of columns.  When I click the button, how can I make it only do the div toggle for that specific column? I think I need to figure some way to get the id of the div to use in the JS.
[17:07:57] <coldhead> performant isn't a real word
[17:08:13] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: FINE! It performs better.
[17:08:26] <coldhead> thank you, sir!
[17:09:21] <ryanneufeld> brl0: http://jsperf.com/jquery-append-vs-html/4
[17:11:08] <ryanneufeld> hrm, that's not the test I was looking for

[17:21:41] <indeedidid> someone ask a question
[17:22:04] <ryanneufeld> what is your favorite color!?
[17:22:16] <indeedidid> #000066
[17:22:18] <indeedidid> next
[17:22:24] <ryanneufeld> What is the average air speed of an unladen swallow?
[17:22:50] <indeedidid> you know what i'm going to ask next, so i'll just not do that
[17:23:17] <ryanneufeld> awwww
[17:23:31] <ryanneufeld> no fun
[17:24:00] <indeedidid> my time is limited
[17:24:02] <indeedidid> i'm in a giving mood
[17:24:33] <ryanneufeld> but I want the peril!
[17:25:27] <indeedidid> On second thought, I shouldn't go to #jquery. It is a silly place.
[17:25:37] <ryanneufeld> lol
[17:35:33] <shoky> Murg|e: you mean like this ? http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/n9vaD/2/
[17:36:00] <bartmax> i need to catch the pager event on jquery cycle plugin. this: onPagerEvent: function() { console.log('changed');} doesn't work ... anyone have an idea how cycle plugin works in this casE ?
[17:36:56] <johnkpaul> bartmax: that _should_ work
[17:37:03] <sayd> hi, how would i find divs with class="" basically empty class
[17:37:08] <bartmax> doesnt :(
[17:37:11] <bartmax> no error
[17:37:13] <LV> is there a selector where I can basically say, "div.interesting" but ALSO have, "contains a span.detail" as a filter?
[17:37:21] <bartmax> pagerEvent = slide changes right?
[17:37:30] <LV> all in one selector? or is there a 2nd step needed...
[17:37:50] <Jon47> LV no, you can't go back up the DOM in CSS
[17:38:06] <Jon47> you can chain a coupla selectors together though
[17:38:06] <indeedidid> LV: http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/
[17:38:14] <indeedidid> might work for you
[17:38:22] <Jon47> oh nice!
[17:38:31] <Jon47> indeedidid: that's news to me
[17:38:38] <indeedidid> that's why im here
[17:38:49] <indeedidid> have some free time after work. i just want to answer jquery questions
[17:39:09] <Jon47> i'm sure it does at least two DOM traversals still but at least it's abstracted out into a single jquery string
[17:39:25] <indeedidid> probably inefficient as hell, but if the app is small enough, it's no biggie
[17:39:30] <sayd> got it .. duh, $('div[class=]')
[17:39:44] <indeedidid> sayd: did that actually work?
[17:39:53] <indeedidid> down to ie7?
[17:40:47] <Murg|e> @shoky, almost, I'm like just the individual list item to expand. So if you click edit on 102, just 102 toggles.
[17:41:08] <Murg|e> *I'm looking for just
[17:42:28] <shoky> Murg|e oh that's easy.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/n9vaD/5/
[17:45:37] <Es0teric> does anyone have a way to handle duplicate properties in a array in jquery?
[17:45:56] <shoky> handle?
[17:46:06] <shoky> oh.
[17:46:31] <shoky> nite
[17:48:42] <wathek> Hi everybody
[17:48:53] <coldhead> hey buddy
[17:48:55] <wathek> could any one helpe me please I'm trying to have a resizable and draggable image
[17:49:03] <wathek> here's my code
[17:49:04] <wathek> http://jsfiddle.net/NgtU3/
[17:49:32] <wathek> the problem is that when I resize the image it freezes and it goes out of the container
[17:50:17] <Murg|e> @shoky, Woot. Thanks a bunch.
[17:51:06] <LV> Jon47: I was afk a sec, but thank you! has() looks like exactly what I need
[17:51:36] <Jon47> don't thank me, i didn't know about that until just now :)
[17:51:37] <coldhead> i can't even get the resize handles to show up
[17:51:49] <wathek> coldhead, yes I noticed that too
[17:51:52] <wathek> it's strange
[17:53:46] <coldhead> wathek: it works better for me now i've included the css http://jsfiddle.net/NgtU3/1/
[17:54:09] <LV> you're right:
[17:54:19] <LV> indeedidid: THANK YOU for the tip about has(). :)
[17:54:35] <wathek> oh yes
[17:55:12] <wathek> coldhead, strange it works well
[17:55:21] <LV> it doesn't *actually* answer my CSS3 question (css3 doesn't seem to support the selector and i'm not actually in jquery :) but it gives me a way to proceed.
[17:55:27] <wathek> coldhead, thank you
[17:55:36] <wathek> coldhead, what did you change ?
[17:56:00] <coldhead> wathek: i added the jQuery UI css from google's CDN
[17:56:10] <coldhead> it's in the Add Resources section on the menu at left
[17:56:31] <wathek> oh I see
[17:56:45] <coldhead> the CSS is not optional for jQ UI
[17:57:31] <wathek> coldhead, look at this http://jsfiddle.net/NgtU3/2/
[17:57:39] <wathek> coldhead, there is the bug
[17:58:16] <wathek> coldhead, try to resize it and you'll see what happen and if you have that on your browser I mean on a real page the image when resized will go out of the container
[17:58:18] <Es0teric> coldhead, have you worked with the lastfm api?
[17:58:35] <coldhead> i have not, Es0teric, i am sorry
[17:59:02] <coldhead> wathek: like http://jsfiddle.net/NgtU3/1/show/
[17:59:13] <Es0teric> well, coldhead, i have duplicate items in a array.. how do i remove the duplicate items in the array?
[17:59:38] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: I have worked with the lastfm api
[17:59:46] <coldhead> wathek: i think you will need to constrain the size of the image, either by setting the max size in the resizeable() options OR by adding your own function that freaks out if it gets too big
[17:59:58] <coldhead> Es0teric: ryanneufeld is definitely your man for this, he's mr social music
[18:00:09] <wathek> coldhead, look at this http://jsfiddle.net/NgtU3/2/show/
[18:00:12] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld cool, how do i filter out the duplicate songs from the lastfm api?
[18:00:13] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: you flatter me
[18:00:22] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: can you show me some code?
[18:00:32] <Es0teric> yeah, ryanneufeld sec
[18:01:15] <coldhead> wathek: i see what you mean, my advice remains the same
[18:01:30] <wathek> coldhead, I'm going to set the max size
[18:02:39] <Es0teric> also, ryanneufeld have you made the lastfm feed refresh at a specific time interval and just show the newest song played?
[18:02:56] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: I'm not sure which feed you're using
[18:03:06] <ryanneufeld> what end point are you querying?
[18:03:11] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld i am using user.getrecenttracks
[18:03:11] <coldhead> wathek: brace yourself to write a function to run after each resize to maybe explicitly constrain it yourself
[18:03:52] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: well, that probably explains the duplicates
[18:04:06] <wathek> coldhead, I don't see what the function should do
[18:04:10] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: if you want to refresh at an interval just use a setTimeout
[18:04:15] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld really? so then how do i get the recent track without duplicates?
[18:05:09] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: look at the docs, you can specify datetime ranges
[18:05:29] <coldhead> wathek: http://jqueryui.com/demos/resizable/#event-stop
[18:05:46] <coldhead> it will need to check that the image is not too big, and is still in the container it should be in
[18:05:57] <coldhead> it's not easy
[18:06:02] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld wait.. first how do i solve this duplicates problem?
[18:06:04] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: as for the recent tracks, how many are you fetching, and have you repeated any?
[18:06:05] <coldhead> you're working around a known bug in UI
[18:06:26] <innociv__> http://www.javascript-coder.com/window-popup/javascript-window-open.phtml What do you call being unable to write to other windows that a user open manually like you CAN do if the javascript opens the window?  It's not single origin point..
[18:06:28] <wathek> coldhead, really ?
[18:06:40] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld i am fetching 4 and yes, some of them do repeat
[18:06:49] <coldhead> i think it's this guy, wathek http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4286
[18:07:10] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: okay, so you've played those songs repeatedly, and lastFM is giving you that list? (just making sure)
[18:07:17] <coldhead> wathek: if you get stuck or have the patience, i would wait for the north american day time, when experts like ajpiano will be able to help you out
[18:07:29] <Es0teric> yes, ryanneufeld
[18:07:35] <wathek> coldhead, ok that's great
[18:07:38] <wathek> thank you coldhead
[18:07:48] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: it strikes me as that is expected output, as for duplicates. Your best bet is to iterate over the list, and check to see if you already have that song
[18:07:56] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/pGCdP/12/ why is it that when you click on an image in the Your Photos box and then click on the X when it shows up in the photos to edit box, $('.js-gallery-select-pane').find('#rand-' + string).find('overlay') keeps returning null?
[18:08:34] <ryanneufeld> someprimetime: overlay is not a dom element
[18:08:44] <ryanneufeld> someprimetime: I think you want .overlay or #overlay
[18:08:51] <ryanneufeld> depending on if you've used a class or an id
[18:09:33] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld well i have a fiddle... and all of these songs its showing, i only played once but theres still duplicates
[18:09:38] <someprimetime> ryanneufeld: ah good catch but even when adding `.` to it, it still doesn't work
[18:09:52] <someprimetime> console.log($('.js-gallery-select-pane').find('#rand-' + string).find('.overlay')); just returns null
[18:10:00] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: fire me the fiddle
[18:10:07] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld -> http://jsfiddle.net/4xp49/1/show/
[18:10:36] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld http://jsfiddle.net/4xp49/2/
[18:10:51] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: that does seem like a bug
[18:11:09] <Dr-Bombay> don't use randomization to get unique IDs. Use counting.
[18:11:13] <Es0teric> ryanneufeld i am running the scobbler on my itunes
[18:11:14] <Es0teric> right now
[18:12:18] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: yeah, looks like lastFM is getting duplicate data somehow
[18:12:24] <ryanneufeld> the dates are 1second appart
[18:12:34] <Es0teric> how do i check?
[18:12:43] <ryanneufeld> inspect the elements in the console
[18:12:47] <ryanneufeld> you're logging them out
[18:12:49] <ryanneufeld> take a look
[18:13:06] <tw2113> dups are definitely coming from the service itself
[18:13:06] <ryanneufeld> I gave to go get my wife now, but when I get back I'll take another look if you're still here.
[18:13:24] <Es0teric> alright, ryanneufeld just send me a message then
[18:13:25] <tw2113> i'm looking at the api request url directly
[18:13:33] <ryanneufeld> Es0teric: as for duplicates, you can compare the mbid on each to see if it is the same as the previous one.
[18:14:20] <Es0teric> alright i'll check that out and tw2113 yeah man
[18:14:29] <Es0teric> idk whats making it send duplicate data
[18:14:38] <RohanBhangui> shoky one more question: how would i reverse the animation on the first click of the rohan button and on future ones have the base animation (the one that makes the elements fan out)
[18:14:43] <RohanBhangui> link is same as you provided
[18:14:54] <RohanBhangui> but im still confused what you did for revision 10
[18:15:37] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/pGCdP/13/ $('.js-gallery-select-pane').find('#rand-' + string).find('.overlay').remove(); is still not being found
[18:16:12] <Es0teric> i think i figured it out...
[18:17:30] <tw2113> do share
[18:17:37] <Es0teric> yeah, it turns out i had ipod scrobbling on
[18:17:41] <Es0teric> AND itunes scrobbling
[18:17:52] <tw2113> heh, i could see that logging things twice
[18:17:53] <Es0teric> but im playing the songs from my ipod
[18:18:18] <Es0teric> so im playing them from my ipod BUT my itunes is also logging it
[18:18:24] <Es0teric> so the scrobbler logs it twice
[18:18:30] <Es0teric> tw2113
[18:18:39] <tw2113> i see ya
[18:19:14] <RohanBhangui> tw2113: can you help me : http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/P9Src/10/                   when i click a child of rohan the animation runs as i wnat it too but how can i reverse this when i click rohan again and further clicks on rohan fan out elements as in the oringinal animation (see clickHandler fucntion)
[18:19:21] <Es0teric> CRAP
[18:19:28] <Es0teric> tw2113 its still logging stuff twice -_-
[18:19:41] <Es0teric> it happened just for a split second that it didnt do duplicate logging
[18:20:28] <tw2113> dunno RohanBhangui
[18:20:43] <tw2113> not quite following the motivation for this type of layout for your clicking :P
[18:20:57] <RohanBhangui> meaning?
[18:21:00] <tw2113> and just never done stuff like this
[18:21:19] <tw2113> you need a lot of things relative to its parent, i can say that much
[18:24:57] <someprimetime> anyone know why it's not able to find the li with the same random string as the cloned one?  http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/pGCdP/14
[18:25:17] <someprimetime> i'm trying to delete the overlay, but it's not even able to find the id of the random string attached to the overlay's parent (which is an li)
[18:25:49] <someprimetime> in bindRemoveHandler() = $('.js-gallery-select-pane').find('#rand-' + string).find('.overlay').remove(); would be what i'm trying to find
[18:29:15] <coldhead> something's living in these linnnnes
[18:31:04] <someprimetime> black widows and brown recluses
[18:31:16] <someprimetime> oh i thought you said linens
[18:31:44] <coldhead> hahahah
[18:31:47] <coldhead> i wish i had
[18:33:26] <coldhead> check ya later, ben_alman
[18:42:06] <someprimetime> coldhead: you want to hear a joke about pizza?
[18:42:22] <tw2113> you wouldn't get it coldhead
[18:42:28] <tw2113> *badum tsssh*
[18:42:42] <someprimetime> close but i don't think he'd get it because it's too cheesy
[18:42:57] <someprimetime> i'm out ttyl all
[18:44:51] <coldhead> lol
[19:55:45] <Whirl3d> wow jquery mobile has taken over dwcs6 markup even when it isn't included. lol apparently, they own the data-role parameter...terribly inappropriate Adobe
[20:16:31] <donnaR> hey is there any way to get the headers length in an ajax req
[20:32:33] <dsdeiz> does the change event only trigger when the value of a select input actually changes?
[20:56:56] <elijahmanor> screen
[21:05:45] <Cork> dsdeiz: it triggers when the value is changed by the user
[21:15:14] <Murg|e> @shoky, or anyone else. I'm having trouble figuring out how to ajax submit just the one form when you go to edit a line item. Im ok with the PHP, just can't figure out the individual item to submit.  http://jsfiddle.net/n9vaD/6/
[21:27:02] <dsdeiz> Cork: it doesn't seem to trigger when you select the same value from the options
[21:27:45] <Whirl3d> lol, that's not changing the value then is it?
[21:28:13] <Whirl3d> Not saying it shouldn't fire, cuz idunno..just semantically...
[21:29:03] <Whirl3d> But I bet you could have to items with the same value in the select and select the unselected item (same value) and it would fire
[21:29:11] <Whirl3d> two*
[21:36:41] <Cork> dsdeiz: ya, cause then its not changed
[21:38:41] <dsdeiz> yep, any ideas how to trigger change event even when you select the same value from the options?
[21:39:01] <Whirl3d> .mouseup
[21:39:34] <dsdeiz> cool. thanks will try that out
[21:42:48] <Whirl3d> $(select).on({mousedown:function (e) {val=$(select).val();},mouseup:function(e) {var newval=$(select).val() if (newval!==val) {do stuf}//else handled by change handler});
[21:53:25] <Whirl3d> http://mrdoob.com/projects/chromeexperiments/ball_pool/
[21:54:13] <Es0teric> would it be wise to set a timeout for a $.getJSON?
[21:54:27] <Es0teric> so new data can come in as its updated
[21:56:52] <Whirl3d> that's why you have callbacks
[22:02:46] <Es0teric> Whirl3d wait what?
[22:04:28] <Whirl3d> $.getJSON is a shortcut for $.ajax(url, {dataType:'json', success:callback});
[22:04:55] <Whirl3d> so when your success callback gives you your data from an ajax request...
[22:05:45] <Whirl3d> or do you mean to do multiple getJSON's with a timeout in between?
[22:05:52] <Es0teric> Whirl3d no
[22:06:01] <Es0teric> just one getJSON
[22:07:27] <Whirl3d> Well, you need to setup a function that handles your getJSON data and pass it as the success handler. LIke $.ajax(url, {dataType:'json', success:updateFields});
[22:08:03] <Whirl3d> then when your data is returned, it's calls the "updateFields(data)" function you defined
[22:09:31] <Whirl3d> that way there's no waiting around or timeout checking. As soon as it is done, it will update your contents.
[22:10:14] <Es0teric> Whirl3d so then its $.getJSON('url', function() { //sucess handler?}, 3000);
[22:10:23] <Es0teric> ?
[22:10:54] <Behi> in jquery ui draggables/droppables, how can we override the logic that determines an elem is over another elem to set its drop target? I want my draggable to be considered dragged over another element, if the cursor resides in that other elem
[22:10:56] <Whirl3d> the function is the success handler
[22:11:50] <Whirl3d> var updateFields=function (json) { //do stuff with json data here}, $.getJSON(url, updateFields);
[22:12:37] <Es0teric> Whirl3d so then i wrap that function in a setTimeout()?
[22:12:47] <Whirl3d> no
[22:12:55] <Es0teric> Whirl3d the json doesnt update unless i refresh the page
[22:12:57] <Whirl3d> it calls the success handler when it's done
[22:13:10] <Es0teric> i want it to update without page refresh
[22:13:13] <Whirl3d> then your success handler is not working correctly
[22:13:23] <Whirl3d> try this:
[22:13:36] <tw2113> the getJSON part pulls in the json, passes it in as url, and passes it all through updateFields
[22:13:49] <tw2113> and the updateFields does its thing
[22:14:02] <Whirl3d> $.getJSON(url, function (data) {console.log(data);});
[22:15:59] <tw2113> would i be wrong to say this?
[22:15:59] <Es0teric> Whirl3d alright sec
[22:16:06] <Whirl3d> If you aren't getting anything to show up in your log, then you might consider using the ajax method (the same thing really) and adding an error handler....$.ajax(url, {dataType:"json",sucess:updateFields, error:function () {alert ("error getting json");});
[22:16:13] <tw2113> with getJSON, when you pass in url and someFunction
[22:16:23] <tw2113> it passes the data in url into someFunction?
[22:16:30] <tw2113> with that function being defined elsewhere
[22:17:23] <Whirl3d> or it could be defined inline too...$.getJSON(url, function (json) {//this is inline  do stuff}}});
[22:17:43] <Es0teric> Whirl3d it passes the data and everything like i said.. i just have to refresh to get new data
[22:18:05] <Whirl3d> meaning you have to send ANOTHER getjson request
[22:18:08] <Whirl3d> lol
[22:18:15] <Es0teric> lol right
[22:18:33] <Whirl3d> so that's a different case. Then you could use setTimeout
[22:18:40] <Whirl3d> but do it in your success handler
[22:20:12] <Whirl3d> like this:   var requestData=function () { $.getJSON(url, function(json){//do stuff, setTimeout(requestData,2000)});
[22:20:58] <Whirl3d> but I would go one step further and set an easy way out of this;
[22:21:45] <Es0teric> Whirl3d well that setTimeout works but theres a problem.. it loads EVERYTHING every 4 secs, it doesnt pre-load the first batch
[22:22:27] <Whirl3d> then you must want a different getjson request
[22:22:50] <Whirl3d> or you need to change your updateFields routine to only update if there's a change
[22:23:08] <Es0teric> yeah, thats what i want, Whirl3d
[22:23:11] <Es0teric> to update when theres a change
[22:23:30] <Whirl3d> Since I don't know the source of your data, it's hard to say if there's a mechanism that says only give me updated info since date/time
[22:23:56] <Es0teric> Whirl3d i am using the lastfm api
[22:23:58] <Whirl3d> sometimes you can pass the last request date/time with your ajax request and the returned json data will be only the new stuff
[22:24:11] <Whirl3d> did you look at their docs?
[22:25:03] <Es0teric> yeah it does have a date method
[22:25:04] <Es0teric> i think
[22:26:25] <xboi209> .
[22:26:25] <Es0teric> Whirl3d -> http://www.last.fm/api/show/user.getRecentTracks
[22:27:19] <xboi209> is it good to specify width and height of an image?
[22:27:56] <Whirl3d> are strawberrys juicy?
[22:28:08] <Whirl3d> not all of them.
[22:28:18] <Whirl3d> sometimes it's a good idea, sometimes its not
[22:28:34] <Es0teric> Whirl3d that date param only scrobbles after a specific time
[22:28:55] <Whirl3d> yeah, and they disable your account if you send too many requests too quickly
[22:29:45] <Whirl3d> I'd love to spend more time to learn their API, but really, you are better off asking for help from them or at least someone else who already knows the api.
[22:30:50] <Es0teric> yea, Whirl3d i figured.. >.>
[22:35:14] <rajnicant> how can i detect any key pressed event without using specific selector
[22:40:03] <coldhead> rajnicant: $(document).keypress()
[22:40:13] <coldhead> i misread your question and did this demo http://jsfiddle.net/QX9YF/
[22:40:36] <coldhead> if you ignore the custom event stuff, it has the $(document).keypress bit
[22:45:17] <coldhead> hey raj
[22:45:38] <Whirl3d> coldhead, does that fiddle work for you? it doesn't work for me.
[22:45:39] <raj> sup
[22:46:01] <coldhead> it works for me
[22:46:12] <coldhead> but that's because i believe in myself
[22:46:18] <coldhead> you have to have faith
[22:46:28] <Whirl3d> glad to hear it. I have been having problems with keypress event handling and maybe its my browser
[22:46:39] <coldhead> or maybe i did it wrong!
[22:46:47] <coldhead> its my first day using keypress events
[22:46:53] <coldhead> i've never done it for realsises
[22:47:48] <rajnicant> how can i detect event for any event on touch screen, i mean event code for every touch
[22:47:55] <rajnicant> is it possible?
[22:48:11] <Whirl3d> yeah, not working in ff or chrome, coldhead.
[22:48:35] <coldhead> rajnicant: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4755505/how-to-recogized-touch-event-using-jquery-for-ipad-safari-browser-is-it-possibl
[22:48:48] <coldhead> no matter, Whirl3d, no one is using it anyway
[22:48:52] <coldhead> lets never speak of it again
[22:48:58] <coldhead> let the fiddle be stricken from the record
[22:49:35] <rajnicant> hmm, i THOUGHT jquery or any framework build on jquery handle the touch on touchscreen
[22:49:43] <BoMbMoNkEy> i love you coldhead
[22:50:00] <coldhead> cheers, ndss56
[22:50:55] <coldhead> i don't know nothing, rajnicant
[22:51:11] <rajnicant> anyways thankyou coldhead for your help
[22:51:43] <BoMbMoNkEy> coldhead: I want to goto Amsterdam.
[22:51:53] <coldhead> i want that for you too, BoMbMoNkEy
[22:51:58] <Whirl3d> rajnicant, https://github.com/dantipa/hammer.js
[22:53:33] <BoMbMoNkEy> coldhead: Will you come with me?
[22:53:39] <datarecall> hey guys im trying to figure out a way to grab all the values with name="star[]" different keys so i can add them up together. cant find anything on google pointing me in the right direction
[22:53:55] <coldhead> i am very poor company, BoMbMoNkEy
[22:53:59] <coldhead> you deserve better
[22:54:42] <coldhead> $('[name^="star"]')
[22:55:34] <panda110> Hi , how to do mouseleave event by native javascript
[22:55:40] <datarecall> how would i grab all the values coldhead ?
[22:56:23] <JeremieDeNoob> hey guys
[22:56:32] <Cork> panda110: if(event.target !=== this) { return; } in a mouseout event
[22:56:37] <rajnicant> thanks Whirl3d this is what i need. Thank you so much
[22:56:49] <JeremieDeNoob> trying to make a yes no or true:false type box in a jqgrid... looked online for over an hour, cannot find. using php...
[22:57:04] <BoMbMoNkEy> datarecall: You would "grab" the data on the server-side; Not using jquery.
[22:57:58] <Whirl3d> datarecall, you would use $.map with the selector coldhead provided
[22:57:58] <datarecall> BoMbMoNkEy i need to grab it on the frontend so i can add up the totals
[22:58:17] <xboi209> is it possible to get the value of an alt tag of an image?
[22:58:22] <JeremieDeNoob> with 700 people here, surely someone has used jqgrid and had this issue... i dont want a checkbox, im really looking for a yes:no label...
[22:58:36] <Cork> xboi209: alt tag? you mean the alt attribute?
[22:58:40] <xboi209> yeah
[22:58:45] <Cork> sure
[22:58:48] <xboi209> how?
[22:58:49] <Cork> attr('alt')
[22:59:00] <xboi209> hmm
[22:59:13] <Whirl3d> var values=$('[name^="star"]').map(function () { return $(this).val();}); will work for you datarecall
[22:59:17] <xboi209> how about of a certain image class?
[22:59:23] <coldhead> datarecall: http://jsfiddle.net/NfTMr/
[22:59:38] <xboi209> alt attribute of a certain image class
[22:59:38] <BoMbMoNkEy> datarecall: If it is user supplied data, most likely via a form, then it would normally be processed server-side... i guess you could use jquery to grab it for validation processes.
[22:59:47] <Cork> xboi209: you want all the images alt messages or?
[23:00:03] <xboi209> wait let me just put it in jsfiddle
[23:00:13] <BoMbMoNkEy> coldhead: I think you would make excellent company.
[23:00:16] <panda110> if(event.target !=== this) { return; } it don't work
[23:00:53] <datarecall> coldhead : http://jsfiddle.net/NfTMr/1/ what would be the best way to get the sum of all the vals
[23:01:31] <xboi209> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/BgeZy/
[23:02:18] <Cork> xboi209: http://jsfiddle.net/BgeZy/1/
[23:02:22] <Cork> this is why i asked
[23:02:38] <Cork> a class can exist multible times, and what do you want to do then?
[23:02:56] <Cork> only grab the first one?
[23:02:59] <Cork> get an array?
[23:03:14] <xboi209> oh in my situation, the class isnt taken
[23:03:17] <xboi209> guarenteed
[23:03:22] <datarecall> is what i was thinking http://jsfiddle.net/NfTMr/2/
[23:03:32] <coldhead> datarecall: http://jsfiddle.net/NfTMr/3/
[23:03:47] <coldhead> use each instead of map
[23:04:09] <Cork> xboi209: if its garanteed to be uniq it would prob be better to use the id attribute instead
[23:04:14] <datarecall> thanks coldhead
[23:04:22] <xboi209> wuts the difference o.O
[23:04:35] <Cork> id="" can only exist on one element
[23:04:43] <Cork> if you have the same id on two elements, its invalid
[23:04:53] <Cork> class can be multible classes on each element
[23:05:02] <Cork> and the class can exist on multible elements
[23:05:23] <xboi209> ok lets do id then
[23:05:26] <Cork> anyway $('.foo1').attr('alt')
[23:05:34] <Cork> or $('#foo1').attr('alt') for id
[23:06:07] <xboi209> wouldnt you have to do $("img#foo1").attr('alt') since we're doing it on images?
[23:07:18] <Cork> nope
[23:07:27] <xboi209> k thnx
[23:07:38] <Cork> id's are uniq, so its the most exact defenition of the target you can express
[23:08:04] <Cork> adding img before, just makes the selector slower for no reason
[23:08:52] <Whirl3d> if you were running a keylogger on you machine, would it intercept the key events in a browser so the didnt fire?
[23:09:06] <coldhead> deftly explained, Cork, kudos
[23:09:25] <coldhead> Whirl3d: it COULD
[23:09:55] <Whirl3d> hmmm now to find out if i'm paranoid or retarded...or both...
[23:09:59] <Whirl3d> lol
[23:10:08] <Cork> Whirl3d: an app, if it hooks into the system deep enough could modify anything it wants to the input
[23:10:29] <Cork> and you couldn't do anything about it
[23:10:35] <JeremieDeNoob> anyone familiar with jqgrid? all I want is the value of my bool from my database to show up as true or false instead of 1 or 0 or check/unchecked...
[23:10:42] <Whirl3d> muahahah
[23:14:13] <coldhead> you're so beautiful but you can't hear me
[23:14:44] <JeremieD_> anyone familiar with jqgrid? all I want is the value of my bool from my database to show up as true or false instead of 1 or 0 or check/unchecked...

[23:19:06] <coldhead> its a very specific question
[23:19:13] <coldhead> as specific as "will you marry me"
[23:25:35] <BoMbMoNkEy> coldhead: Sorry, I can't marry you.
[23:26:08] <coldhead> i appreciate your taking the time to answer, BoMbMoNkEy
[23:27:05] <BoMbMoNkEy> coldhead: ... because that would be gross.
[23:27:26] <coldhead> i don't need the reasons, i understand implicitly
[23:27:39] <coldhead> elective affinities
