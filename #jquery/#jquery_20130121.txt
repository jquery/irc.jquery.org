[00:03:24] <xec> aaas: yeah, i meant to write css properties with js, like with .css() - you could set position to relative and use the 'left' or 'right' properties (depending on what direction it makes sense to move it), or use margins for instance
[00:04:00] <aaas> xec thanks..i found this jfiddle and I think I might be able to get it to work http://jsfiddle.net/EaHU7/
[00:04:02] <aaas> thanks
[00:04:10] <aaas> basically what you were saying
[00:05:14] <xec> yeah. if you want to animate you can use .animate() instead, which accepts the same css options
[00:30:16] <iman> how can I send an $.ajax() request when page loads completely ?
[00:30:36] <iman> should i just use $(document).ready(function() {}) or are there something different ?
[00:31:02] <adibhanna> hey, how can i fill a dropdownlist depending on the value of another dropdownlist?
[00:31:27] <xec> iman: if you want it after images and scripts are loaded, use $(window).load(...) instead
[00:31:42] <iman> xec: thank you
[00:31:45] <_sCoRpi> adibhanna: depending on the selected value, make an ajax request, then when you get the response, append option-tags to the next select box
[00:32:23] <adibhanna> also, they values that i want to append are coming from a database
[00:33:05] <_sCoRpi> adibhanna: like i said, ajax request
[00:33:21] <adibhanna> alright
[00:33:27] <adibhanna> thanks
[00:33:39] <codechip> hi all
[00:33:46] <vlcn> morning
[00:34:00] <codechip> i need some help related to jqeury autocomplete plugin
[00:34:33] <vlcn> can anyone give me a clue as to what is going wrong here: https://clients.beyondhosting.net/automation/test/progress_test.html
[00:34:35] <iman> why is it wrong ?http://jsfiddle.net/pgKvX/
[00:35:15] <xec> iman: choose no wrap from the dropdown in jsfiddle
[00:35:25] <xec> iman: http://jsfiddle.net/pgKvX/1/
[00:35:57] <iman> xec: it works, thanks
[00:35:59] <codechip> @vlcn: somewhere you are trying to read "resultText
[00:36:10] <codechip> proprty from undefined
[00:36:28] <vlcn> codechip: yes, I am.  but why is data undefined here?
[00:38:38] <iman> xec: do you see something wrong here ? http://jsfiddle.net/pgKvX/2/
[00:39:05] <iman> xec: ajax block doesn't call at all
[00:39:35] <grafi> vlcn data isnt undefined, data Object { status_id="10", percent="100", message="Installation Completed "}
[00:39:38] <codechip> @vlnc: sry...short of time to look into it
[00:40:07] <_sCoRpi> iman: syntax error
[00:40:11] <codechip> yes probably
[00:40:22] <iman> _sCoRpi: where ?
[00:40:48] <iman> _sCoRpi: i miss latest } there, but i fixed that
[00:41:22] <_sCoRpi> iman: http://jsfiddle.net/pgKvX/3/
[00:41:32] <vlcn> codechip: bah, I think it was the fact I wasn't supplying the complete url
[00:41:38] <codechip> ok..i've implemented a jquery automcomplete with scroll, like this : http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#maxheight
[00:41:39] <vlcn> I changed that and its working now.
[00:41:45] <dsdeiz> hey all, ive added a slideToggle to an element and this element is located at the bottom of the page. Is there anyway that the page also scrolls while the animation happens?
[00:42:04] <_sCoRpi> iman: you still got two errors, one being that there is no horizontalNav() function and the other one of course that there is no getmessage on jsfiddle.net
[00:42:21] <codechip> problem is when i type a little in textbox, and then start scrolling thrugh dropdown values, it changes whatever i typed earlier
[00:42:26] <iman> _sCoRpi: lol, thank you, this is because of there aren't any good ide for javascript and jquery, and eclipse doesn't have good support for js
[00:42:41] <_sCoRpi> iman: fuck ides
[00:42:47] <_sCoRpi> iman: try sublime text 2
[00:42:48] <codechip> how can i stop changing text in textbox, whenever i'm scrolling the dropdown results ?
[00:42:52] <_sCoRpi> with the jslint plugin
[00:43:03] <iman> jslint ..
[00:43:09] <iman> let me search it
[00:43:18] <_sCoRpi> no, search sublime text :P
[00:43:22] <_sCoRpi> *search for
[00:43:28] <grafi> hooray ^^
[00:43:34] <_sCoRpi> and then through  the package management install the jslint plugin
[00:44:19] <iman> jslint : The JavaScript Verifier takes a JavaScript source and scans it.
[00:45:14] <codechip> how to prevent text change of text box when scrolling through results in jquery autocomplete
[00:45:29] <iman> _sCoRpi: thank you a lot ,  i am trying sublime with jslint
[00:46:17] <_sCoRpi> iman: welcome
[00:48:30] <coppa> I can't understand if finally Modernizr added async tests or not
[00:50:12] <codechip> how to prevent text change of text box when scrolling through results in jquery autocomplete?
[00:55:48] <vicary> hi, I got a question. Does jquery did something to dragenter like what mouseenter on mouseover does?
[01:01:29] <Cork> vicary: can you try rephrasing that sentence?
[01:02:42] <vicary> sorry for my bad english, could you make sense from it?
[01:03:11] <Cork> i guess you're talking about draggable, but i'm not sure what your question is
[01:03:53] <vicary> the dragenter event currently works kind of like mouseover, and I need a neat version like mouseenter on the native drag and drop thing.
[01:04:13] <Cork> ah
[01:04:54] <Cork> you would prob have to check this == event.target
[01:05:03] <Cork> in the normal dragenter event
[01:05:43] <vicary> ah, so I have to do this wrapper function myself.
[01:06:26] <noregret> since I have a one page app, the user session could timeout and when any ajax request is fired, it will be forbidden.. how can I detect taht for all my ajax requests and probably do a redirect
[01:08:00] <vicary> @noregret handle all ajax requests before you did your session validation, how you do that depends on your server platform.
[01:10:54] <Cork> ?.ajaxError @ noregret
[01:11:09] <Cork> -_-
[01:11:11] <Cork> down again...
[01:11:19] <Cork> noregret: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[01:11:33] <vicary> @Cork will that also captures other HTTP errors except his session issue?
[01:11:56] <Cork> the timeout most likely triggers a http error, so ya
[01:13:01] <noregret> Cork: so e.g. a forbibeed is considered an error, right ?
[01:13:26] <Cork> noregret: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html
[01:13:45] <sample001>  hello there can someone help me how to put an ajax request with special character in url parameter ?
[01:13:46] <Cork> 4xx section
[01:14:13] <Cork> sample001: just give it to data and jquery till encode it for you
[01:15:42] <vicary> @sample001 use objects in the data param, jQuery will do the escapes.
[01:16:16] <noregret> Cork: I know that it has the code 403...
[01:17:29] <vicary> @Cork do you know if jquery is planned to do the dragenter wrapper function?
[01:17:53] <Cork> vicary: not that i heard of
[01:18:30] <Cork> vicary: you can add it as a plugin if you like though
[01:19:18] <vicary> this is sad
[01:20:07] <sample001> Cork: thanks
[01:45:39] <Doumie> i've created a game in HTML5 and now i'm thinking about improving my performance using nodejs
[01:45:51] <Doumie> so i was thinking...
[01:46:21] <Doumie> if i'd draw the canvas with nodejs instead of client-side-js and then push it to client for showing (using sockets.io for an example)
[01:46:24] <Doumie> would that work... ?
[01:46:53] <Doumie> Currently the problem is, that i'm running into some performance issues with drawing / calculating everything I need
[01:47:39] <Doumie> so I thought, if it would be possible to do all that and get the canvas to the client from nodejs under 25ms... I'd maybe win performance
[01:48:07] <Doumie> Hm... I should stringify my canvas I have right now, and see how big it is in size
[01:50:39] <Doumie> hmm
[01:50:45] <Doumie> this isn't actually the correct channel
[01:50:46] <Doumie> lol
[01:50:47] <Doumie> nvm me
[01:55:09] <marcules> hi
[01:56:32] <mindis|wurk> hi guise. are there any special things one needs to consider to stop right clicks from bubbling? i've added mouseup, mousedown, click and contextmenu events for an element and those trigger fine with RMB, but using stopPropagation() doesn't stop it from bubbling to the parent elements
[01:58:30] <NiQuil> Hi There
[01:59:19] <NiQuil> Can anyone tell me how I can find out when a particular function of JQuery was introduced?
[01:59:43] <xec> NiQuil: it should be in the docs
[02:00:05] <NiQuil> Here? http://doc.jsfiddle.net/basic/introduction.html
[02:00:27] <xec> that's jsfiddle docs, not jquery docs
[02:00:36] <NiQuil> Yes i see now
[02:00:56] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/
[02:14:44] <interop_madness> hi there, i have a problem with a $.ajax() call. i make a request known to raise a 404 error, where the response body should contain error details as JSON. problem is, jqXHR.responseText is empty. also, firebug indicates that the response body is empty. the same request in fiddler actually yields the correct JSON in the response
[02:15:24] <interop_madness> here is the $.ajax() call along with details to the problem: http://pastie.org/5767195
[02:16:56] <corehook> hi all, how i can catch getJSON exception ?
[02:17:11] <corehook> my getJSON dont call my callback function
[02:17:26] <NiQuil> Hi There
[02:18:51] <NiQuil> In addidtion to my question of where to find out when a certain function was included in jQuery I have found that the Draggable function was introduced in the 1.5 version in some form. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.5/Draggable
[02:19:15] <NiQuil> We use 1.8 so that is nice it would seem
[02:19:21] <devOlsen> Hey all, quick question trying wrap my head around the logic of capturing when a person has rapidly pressed keycode 13 (enter) 4 times within 1.5 ms.. any suggestions in listening for rapid key event's of a particular keycode?
[02:19:56] <NiQuil> But, when I want to download the plugin it directs me to the 1.9 version, which we do not use. How can I still use draggable?
[02:21:34] <devOlsen> NiQuil: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/jquery-ui.min.js will give you latest version, where as http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.5/jquery-ui.min.js will give you the specific version you want.
[02:22:00] <NiQuil> Ok, let me see that, thanks already
[02:23:28] <NiQuil> So the .draggable function should work in 1.8.4 version?
[02:24:16] <devOlsen> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/
[02:24:31] <devOlsen> is the api for latest jQuery UI Draggable.
[02:24:40] <NiQuil> Yeah i saw that link
[02:25:00] <NiQuil> I found many links on the draggable. The latest is from 1.9 version
[02:25:21] <corehook> guys
[02:25:24] <corehook> please help me :(
[02:25:32] <NiQuil> Thank you for your help, it is greatly appreciated.
[02:25:38] <devOlsen> np.
[02:25:46] <corehook> i am tired, two days i cant understand why my getJSON dont call callback function
[02:25:55] <devOlsen> corehook, are you using chrome?
[02:26:02] <corehook> yep
[02:26:04] <xec> devOlsen: you could increment a var on keypress, and decrement it in a settimeout
[02:26:06] <corehook> and firefox
[02:26:14] <evaluate> Hello.
[02:26:19] <rindolf> Hi all.
[02:26:30] <xec> hello
[02:26:32] <devOlsen> in the console, are you seeing an error about crossdomain when you fire off the json xhr?
[02:26:36] <devOlsen> thanks xec
[02:26:59] <rindolf> xec: hi, what's up?
[02:27:02] <evaluate> I'm trying to create an input with a datepicker, but I don't get any errors and it doesn't work either. Here is a jsfiddle where I'm trying to replicate the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/kk4Jz/1/ Any idea what I'm doing wrong?
[02:27:08] <devOlsen> or an error in general.
[02:28:12] <interop_madness> disregard my earlier question, setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header server-side fixed the problem
[02:28:32] <evaluate> whoops: http://jsfiddle.net/kk4Jz/3/
[02:29:49] <NiQuil> Devolsem, how is it that the draggable api was already introduced since 1.8 and the api does not seem to mention it? http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Draggable  and http://plugins.jquery.com/ui.draggable/
[02:30:11] <NiQuil> I mean, can, or can i not use it whith 1.8.4
[02:30:21] <NiQuil> It seems a contradiction?
[02:30:37] <devOlsen> Draggable was introduced to jquery UI a long long time ago.
[02:30:46] <devOlsen> so yes, it will work up to the latest version.
[02:31:56] <NiQuil> I see it was introduced in 1.5 http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.5/Draggable
[02:32:35] <NiQuil> The thin is that your link doesnt mention 1.5 through 1.8 and that got me confused : http://plugins.jquery.com/ui.draggable/
[02:32:54] <NiQuil> sorry, I must misinterpret the meaning of the versions or something I guess
[02:34:05] <corehook> status:Â [Exception: DOMException]
[02:34:05] <corehook> statusText:Â [Exception: DOMException]
[02:34:08] <corehook> what is it ?
[02:35:28] <Cork> corehook: context please
[02:35:48] <NiQuil> Core it could be a number of things this is one of them: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11478
[02:36:26] <corehook> getJSON dont call callback function
[02:36:54] <Cork> so it chokes on something in you're response
[02:37:35] <Cork> first validate that you're json is valid
[02:37:48] <Cork> and that you're sending it from the same domain as the webpage is loaded from
[02:37:59] <devOlsen> evaluate, I moved the scripts (UI and UI's CSS, ps. you were missing the css for UI) to the filddle's resource section, instead of the html portion. http://jsfiddle.net/kk4Jz/15/
[02:39:14] <devOlsen> I agree 90% of the time json xhr fails is cause a cross domain (use jsonp in that instance if you have access to both domains) or malformed json response.
[02:39:15] <evaluate> devOlsen, but is there a reason why it won't work in the HTML portion?
[02:39:47] <devOlsen> yeah, look where you are pointing the scripts too.
[02:40:00] <devOlsen> there is no web site on the internet called /wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/jquery.ui.core.min.js :)
[02:40:15] <corehook> Cork, domain is same
[02:40:23] <corehook> and json is valid becouse its not my code
[02:40:28] <corehook> its from http://arbee-design.co.uk/jqchat/room/1/
[02:40:29] <evaluate> devOlsen, yeah, I changed that in http://jsfiddle.net/kk4Jz/3/ , but it still didn't work… :-\
[02:40:40] <corehook> hm..
[02:41:05] <corehook> may be becouse his server return date format in json with DOT
[02:41:10] <corehook> my server return with comma
[02:41:23] <Cork> json with dot??
[02:41:40] <corehook> no, in date format
[02:41:50] <corehook> demo site server return data like this
[02:41:56] <Cork> don't think so
[02:42:03] <corehook> status:Â 0
[02:42:03] <corehook> time:Â 1358764832.3
[02:42:08] <corehook> my server this:
[02:42:09] <Cork> but save the json and reduce it until you find what causes it
[02:42:17] <corehook> "status": 1,	
[02:42:17] <corehook> "time": 1358764385,17,
[02:42:20] <Cork> ah
[02:42:28] <Cork> ya "time": 1358764385,17, <-- isn't valid
[02:42:33] <corehook> ok thx
[02:42:34] <Cork> you have 17 without key
[02:42:43] <corehook> fu**king django
[02:42:49] <corehook> freeman:D
[02:42:50] <Cork> ya "time": 1358764385,"dec":17,
[02:42:51] <corehook> thx
[02:42:53] <Cork> would be ok
[02:43:02] <corehook> ok
[02:43:09] <Cork> or use dot :)
[02:43:47] <Cork> corehook: the code you're using isn't using a function thats strict about generating json
[02:44:00] <Cork> corehook: you should look into finding a better option
[02:46:11] <devOlsen> evaluate, look at the classes you have on the input.
[02:46:27] <devOlsen> one of them is used to prevent setup of date picker on the element.
[02:47:17] <devOlsen> evaluate http://jsfiddle.net/kk4Jz/25/
[02:54:29] <evaluate> ohh, wow, "hasDatepicker" actually _prevents_ it from having a datepicker? Now _that_ is counter-intuitive.
[02:54:50] <evaluate> devOlsen, thank you very, very much for the help! I guess I would've never figured this out by myself...
[02:55:46] <devOlsen> np.
[03:25:40] <ParanoidGal> I've got a runaway thumbnail issues on http://vid81.com/liat/ Developer of the plugin say it's down to a dual jQuery call issue but I can't see it?
[03:31:05] <aaronmcadam> Why are you using noConflict?
[03:32:30] <esk_> what is the actual use of noConflict in general?
[03:33:12] <aaronmcadam> ?noConflict @ esk_
[03:33:34] <aaronmcadam> bot-t isn't here, shit
[03:33:45] <ParanoidGal> aaronmcadam: Are you referring to me?
[03:34:05] <aaronmcadam> are you a bot?
[03:34:32] <rindolf> ParanoidGal: hmmm... Liat is a common Israeli feminine name.
[03:34:50] <aaronmcadam> Oh yeah ParanoidGal I was
[03:35:10] <aaronmcadam> "Many JavaScript libraries use $ as a function or variable name, just as jQuery does. In jQuery's case, $ is just an alias for jQuery, so all functionality is available without using $. If you need to use another JavaScript library alongside jQuery, return control of $ back to the other library with a call to $.noConflict(). "
[03:35:58] <ParanoidGal> aaronmcadam: It's because Wordpress tends to use noConflict as default I don't believe I implemented it
[03:36:26] <ParanoidGal> aaronmcadam: Or if I did I don't recall it... which isn't entirely impossible ;)
[03:36:30] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:36:46] <ParanoidGal> rindolf: The client is Sri Lankan, think her parents got the name from South Pacific ;)
[03:36:56] <rindolf> ParanoidGal: ah, OK.
[03:37:50] <ParanoidGal> aaronmcadam: If it was a Jquery call issue then wouldn't it mean the thumbnails wouldn't be doing anything or am I suffering from Monday morning stupidity?
[03:38:58] <aaronmcadam> what exactly do you mean by "jQuery call issue"
[03:39:52] <aaronmcadam> ParanoidGal: did you write jquery.custom.js?
[03:39:59] <ParanoidGal> aaronmcadam: The slider is a plugin, the developer says that the issue with the thumbnails going mad is because jQuery is being called twice
[03:40:22] <aaronmcadam> what's the name ofi t
[03:40:25] <aaronmcadam> of it*
[03:40:27] <ParanoidGal> aaronmcadam: No, I'm customising a template that the client has originally had developed
[03:40:48] <aaronmcadam> oh right, that's why it sucks then :D
[03:41:13] <ParanoidGal> aaronmcadam: http://codecanyon.net/item/slider-revolution-responsive-wordpress-plugin/2751380?sso?WT.ac=search_item&WT.seg_1=search_item&WT.z_author=themepunch
[03:41:45] <ParanoidGal> aaronmcadam: Yeah it would be! However when the clients pay you do whatever they say ;)
[03:41:46] <aaronmcadam> You paid for it, why doesn't he tell you where the problem is
[03:42:34] <aaronmcadam> yes
[03:42:39] <aaronmcadam> you're including the files twice
[03:42:45] <aaronmcadam> once in the head
[03:42:46] <ParanoidGal> aaronmcadam: He's just passing the buck it seems. I'm trying to find out the call for the movement, if I could stop that then it would be problem solved
[03:42:49] <aaronmcadam> and again on line 125
[03:43:10] <aaronmcadam> you shouldn't include the scripts like that
[03:43:17] <aaronmcadam>  <div id="frontslider">
[03:43:25] <aaronmcadam> get rid of the script includes there
[03:45:24] <ParanoidGal> aaronmcadam: Problem is that the call at <div id="frontslider"> is a shortcode required by the plugin to embed it
[03:45:38] <aaronmcadam> well remove it from the head then
[03:45:56] <aaronmcadam> or edit the plugin
[03:46:12] <aaronmcadam> or ask him why the fuck it's doing that
[03:47:11] <ParanoidGal> aaronmcadam: Sounds like the solution. Thanks for looking at it :)
[03:47:18] <aaronmcadam> no prob
[03:47:26] <aaronmcadam> Are you including the files in the head yourself?
[03:49:30] <ParanoidGal> aaronmcadam: Nope. I personally have added no jQuery into the header. The only thing I've done is added an enqueue script http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script
[03:49:52] <aaronmcadam> to include the slider?
[03:50:01] <jacks_appendix> Hello, has anyone here encountered version 1.9.0 not factoring in padding when animating? My animations on elements with padding have started jumping on start and end :(
[03:51:29] <ParanoidGal> No just to get jQuery loading. The plugin is doing all the calling
[03:51:51] <aaronmcadam> must be his plugin screwing it up then
[03:52:56] <ParanoidGal> Yeah I'm thinking of throwing it in the bin. Cheers for looking, I appreciate it!
[03:53:02] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[03:55:56] <trinadh> ParanoidGal: try aetting overflow:hidden; for the css selector class tp-bullets
[03:57:03] <trinadh> ParanoidGal: .tp-bullets.tp-thumbs { overflow : hidden ; }
[04:01:58] <ParanoidGal> Thanks trinadh I'll give it a go :)
[04:03:54] <trinadh> ParanoidGal: welcome
[04:04:34] <ParanoidGal> trinadh: You're a rockstar, that works. Thank you :)
[04:04:40] <chris____> There is an intermittent error experienced by the users of my site and I cannot explain it.  It might be javascript related but I'm not sure.

[04:24:00] <noregret> $('#header').append('<strong>Session timed out... redirecting to login...</strong>').delay(2000); this is not appending then waiting 2 secs, is there something wrong ?
[04:27:13] <tlkr> noregret, as far as I know delay is for the animations queue and won't work used like that.
[04:27:26] <tlkr> well you can specify a queue, but by default it's the standard animations queue
[04:27:42] <Trisox> you could use setTimeout() for example
[04:27:43] <adibhanna> guys
[04:27:44] <adibhanna> do i have any syntax error here? http://paste.laravel.com/giR
[04:27:46] <tlkr> you should probably use the native setTimeout function in this situation
[04:27:50] <tlkr> as Trisox said
[04:28:06] <tlkr> what is firebug telling you adibhanna ?
[04:29:59] <noregret> tlkr: i'm using something like that http://pastie.org/5769945.. i want to display the msg before redirecting
[04:30:47] <tlkr> Yeah that's not going to work
[04:30:52] <noregret> this is not waiting, it's directly redirecting
[04:30:53] <noregret> hmm
[04:31:07] <noregret> ok then, i'll use settimeout
[04:31:11] <tlkr> put the window.location inside a setTimeout(function() { window.location = path }, 2000)
[04:31:30] <Trisox> what tlkr said :D
[04:36:22] <jacks_appendix> Hello, has anyone here encountered version 1.9.0 not factoring in padding when animating? My animations on elements with padding have started jumping on start and end :(
[04:38:22] <chris____> Is there a way of loggin the javascript errors that happen on clients browsers?
[04:40:18] <jacks_appendix> chris____, if you're throwing exceptions you could easily log those. But usually a javascript error halts execution for anything happening after
[04:42:11] <danheberden> you *could* wrap the whole thing in a try{}catch(e){} and get the exceptions that way, but eww
[04:44:02] <chris____> jacks_appendix: I have an intermittent problem in the browser and I've n
[04:45:08] <jacks_appendix> chris____, so you're having an IE problem, in my experience lol
[04:45:27] <chris____> jacks_appendix: yes and I can't recreate it
[04:46:03] <chris____> jacks_appendix: ..and there is nothing in the apache log file.   As soon as the user clicks a form submit button the browser freaks.
[04:47:20] <jacks_appendix> Using ajax? have you validated the page for relevant errors?
[04:50:49] <patie> superfish plugin alternative ? because dont support 1.9+
[04:52:28] <seutje> patie: do u still need js for that? isn't it just to make old IE understand li:hover ?
[04:55:14] <noregret> tlkr: that waited for x time then appended then redirected directly
[04:56:16] <noregret> can't i appened THEN wait instead of the opposite
[04:58:55] <patie> seutje: maybe u right
[04:59:20] <Trisox> :-)
[05:00:05] <tlkr> noregret, show me your code.
[05:01:44] <noregret> tlkr: http://pastie.org/5770758
[05:02:14] <noregret> ahh sorry
[05:02:19] <noregret> i will append before settime
[05:02:23] <noregret> how stupid of me
[05:02:30] <tlkr> =]
[05:04:26] <Trisox> noregret: its not stupid now your aware of it ;-)
[05:04:36] <Trisox> its logical
[05:05:01] <noregret> lol yeah
[05:05:33] <Trisox> :-) thats key
[05:09:19] <motaka2> hello whats wrong with this piec eof code  ?   it seems that something is wrong cause when I put an alert it doesnt work - http://pastebin.com/RG2tJa2Z
[05:10:51] <tlkr> "<?php echo Reg::get ( "dss" ) -> urlActionContentSaveGet () ; ?>",
[05:11:05] <tlkr> you aren't escaping the " within the string.
[05:12:04] <motaka2> tlkr: I dont get you
[05:13:37] <tlkr> if you put " within a string wrapped by "string" then it will terminate the string unless you dss is a variable in which case you need to concatinate the string using "string"+var+"string", otherwise you need to escape the use of " within a "string" by escaping it like this "string\"morestring"
[05:13:52] <tlkr> s/you dss/dss
[05:14:06] <tlkr> concatenate*
[05:14:33] <tlkr> javascript syntax 101
[05:14:42] <noregret> motaka2: just use single quotes for the php blocks
[05:16:16] <tlkr> if you are allowing your client send php code to the server for eval also you should consider definitely not doing that.
[05:17:19] <motaka2> tlkr: noregret but this one also doesnt work - I mean I dont see tha alert  http://pastebin.com/9u7XqJ5K
[05:17:40] <HarryPitfall> well... this new jquery version really breaks aparts things
[05:18:10] <HarryPitfall> i have a plugin here, that uses $.browser, to detect some serious flaws in browsers
[05:18:15] <HarryPitfall> about key pressing bubbles
[05:18:34] <HarryPitfall> :/
[05:19:01] <Trisox> yea $.browser is not in the new version any more
[05:19:04] <tlkr> motaka2, that's different code?
[05:19:19] <HarryPitfall> also, jquery 2.0 is for IE9 and later only?
[05:19:20] <motaka2> tlkr: no It's just the whole code
[05:19:25] <noregret> motaka2: i don't think teh selector is valid..
[05:19:28] <Trisox> you could use modernizr
[05:19:38] <Trisox> for detection
[05:19:59] <Trisox> http://modernizr.com/
[05:20:00] <motaka2> noregret: It's valid cause when I remove the conf it works
[05:20:46] <motaka2> I found the problem thank you
[05:20:52] <Trisox> HarryPitfall: what do you want to detect ?
[05:23:10] <HarryPitfall> is related to mozilla browser, and preventDefault() of spacebar on checkboxes
[05:23:23] <Trisox> hmm
[05:23:24] <HarryPitfall> e.preventDefault() don't stop the checkbox change
[05:23:41] <HarryPitfall> other browsers prevents normally
[05:23:50] <HarryPitfall> mozilla still change the checkbox
[05:24:03] <HarryPitfall> keydown event
[05:24:20] <Trisox> return false?
[05:24:24] <Trisox> dunno ;)
[05:24:40] <HarryPitfall> i need to bubble this...
[05:25:01] <HarryPitfall> false will also stop the propagation
[05:25:10] <Trisox> yup
[05:25:24] <Trisox> never had this issue before :|
[05:25:26] <HarryPitfall> i've read somewhere that 1.9 fix something related to checkbox
[05:25:43] <HarryPitfall> maybe 1.9 don't need my ugly $.browser fix
[05:32:36] <motaka2> This is another version -  I mean the compiled one that I still cant see the alert   http://pastebin.com/Fy6nuGp0
[05:33:37] <motaka2> Sorry I can see thank you
[05:34:31] <javascripter> !function( ehlo )( hello );
[05:35:31] <javascripter> jquery.mobile sux
[05:35:55] <javascripter> it hangs a lot
[05:37:13] <Trisox> hang youth ! i hate that
[05:56:53] <codecowboy> hi. what options do I have if I want to move the input box away from a range slider? I am retrofitting it to some existing markup which has the input box above the slider
[06:40:28] <computer2000> how can i make a text line only show as much words as fit into the line? like cutting off overflow text/words... without ellipsis
[06:40:59] <javascripter> you must put it inside div with overflow: hidden and width
[06:41:23] <javascripter> fixed width
[06:45:09] <cpierce> my server side script passes /search/somesearchwordhere
[06:45:16] <cpierce> how do i pass that to json in a jquery ui autocomplete
[06:45:32] <cpierce> or how do i pass it to my json ajax page rather ...
[06:45:41] <javascripter> juz read window.location ?
[06:45:44] <javascripter> *just
[06:46:30] <cpierce> no i'm trying to have the script call the right server side location /search/<whatever you type> how do i pass <whatever you type> through jquery.ui autocomplete
[06:48:05] <BillCriswell> cpierce: It's probably better to do /serach then pass the search parameter as data.
[06:48:35] <cpierce> BillCriswell: i tried doing that but it won't actually autocompelte at the point ... it shows all the values but it won't show just the part that has been typed in the textfield
[06:50:05] <cpierce> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1350974182 <-- my first attempt that works
[06:50:06] <BillCriswell> cpierce: It sounds like you're not passing the search term properly. It's hard to tell without seeing it, though.
[06:50:15] <cpierce> except it doesn't actually limit to based on what i've typed
[06:50:40] <cpierce> as i type i'd like it to eliminate non relevant cities
[06:51:18] <cpierce> my script can handle /load_city/lev which would just pull up relevant LEV% city's form the database but i'm not sure how to pass LEV to the /load_city script with jquery
[06:51:42] <cpierce> pass it dynamically i mean
[06:52:29] <BillCriswell> cpierce: This is probably not the best way but you could do source: '/load_city/' + encodeURIComponent($('input').val());
[06:52:53] <BillCriswell> This is coming from someone who just saw the UI autocomplete lol.
[06:55:25] <cpierce> can i pass it as $(this).val()
[06:55:33] <BillCriswell> Sure.
[06:55:46] <BillCriswell> If this is the input that should be used.
[06:56:32] <BillCriswell> So /load_city just returns a list of cities, right? Like.. an array of them?
[06:57:00] <cpierce> a json list of them
[06:57:21] <cpierce> [{"label":"Bethpage","value":"Bethpage"},{"label":"East Meadow","value":"East Meadow"},{"label":"Hicksville","value":"Hicksville"},{"label":"Levittown","value":"Levittown"},{"label":"Old Bethpage","value":"Old Bethpage"},{"label":"Seaford","value":"Seaford"},{"label":"Wantagh","value":"Wantagh"},{"label":"Westbury","value":"Westbury"}]
[06:58:58] <seba4> hi guys... i got a question ... is it possible in .dialog to define color for background ... so when dialog popsup everything else darkens
[07:02:43] <BillCriswell> cpierce: And with your example it just loads them all but doesn't limit them as you type?
[07:03:08] <Trisox> seba4: set to modal
[07:03:47] <cpierce> BillCriswell: correct ... not at all like the example on the documentation
[07:03:50] <cpierce> it just loads every result
[07:04:16] <seba4> i got modal: true
[07:04:30] <seba4> but nothing change..
[07:04:43] <seba4> and now i defined style on
[07:04:52] <seba4> .ui-widget-overlay {
[07:04:52] <seba4>   background:red !important;
[07:05:01] <seba4> but nothing happends
[07:05:48] <seba4> ok ok it work.. there is a problem with z-index
[07:06:38] <BillCriswell> cpierce:Hmm..
[07:07:16] <binarious> Hi. Is there a jQuery Tablesorter which works with 1.9?
[07:07:41] <BillCriswell> I feel like it's something really simple that's just hiding from me haha
[07:10:21] <cpierce> i thought autocomplete would autocomplete
[07:10:40] <cpierce> but i guess it doesn't do that automatically so i'm trying to pass the result and it just isn't documented how to pass it
[07:11:06] <CesoieLampo> hi
[07:12:03] <CesoieLampo> i have a weird behaviour on jquery (using jqueryui), can i ask someone?
[07:14:22] <BillCriswell> So the input is showing up with all the labels under it but as you type it doesn't narrow the results?
[07:14:27] <BillCriswell> cpierce: ^
[07:14:35] <myrman> CesoieLampo: don't ask to ask, just ask
[07:15:33] <CesoieLampo> haha ok sorry
[07:15:52] <codecowboy> how do I get the max and min values of an input of type range? is there a better way than $('#cash-slider-amount').attr('max') ?
[07:17:31] <CesoieLampo> i added tabs to my page and they work good. But when i try to add a submit button to the same page the tabs change format (they become bigger). What am i doing wrong?
[07:21:54] <BillCriswell> cpierce: Are you looking to query every time the person types or you wan tthat static list?
[07:22:25] <CesoieLampo> And.. i see the page perfectly in Firefox and Chrome. IE has some problem.
[07:23:28] <BillCriswell> cpierce: http://pastie.org/pastes/5773379/text is along the lines of what I was thinking about..
[07:24:27] <BillCriswell> cpierce: Err.. nevermind. Shouldn't need to do that. Your data seems like it shoudl work just fine.
[07:28:52] <treeprogram> Hi, is there any way to trigger an event when a drop down list is expanded?
[07:29:46] <NodeX> a select box?
[07:30:03] <treeprogram> NodeX yes a select box
[07:30:06] <treeprogram> like a country select box
[07:30:13] <treeprogram> where when you click it, it expands and shows the countries
[07:30:28] <NodeX> there is no such element as a "country select box", there is a generic <select> element
[07:30:45] <treeprogram> NodeX yes I know, I was giving an example of how it could be used
[07:30:50] <NodeX> $("#your-seelct-box").change(function(){ do_your_cool_stuff_here(); });
[07:31:01] <treeprogram> NodeX thanks
[07:31:09] <NodeX> that's when it changes
[07:31:27] <NodeX> if you want it when it's just open without any selection then you need to use "click" instead
[07:31:34] <treeprogram> NodeX I see ok
[07:31:42] <treeprogram> so pretty simple
[07:32:01] <NodeX> but the click will also fire when you "click" on an option inside it due to bubbling
[07:32:15] <BillCriswell> I can only get it to trigger with mousedown in Chrome. Click doesn't seem to work.
[07:32:31] <treeprogram> NodeX hmm.. are there any work arounds to that?
[07:32:42] <NodeX> treeprogram : just test what was clicked
[07:33:11] <BillCriswell> "mousedown" might be a better choice for the select.
[07:33:14] <NodeX> click(function(event) { ... if(event.nodeName=='OPTION') .... or something like that iirc
[07:33:28] <treeprogram> I'll try both
[07:33:30] <NodeX> click works fine in chrome
[07:34:53] <BillCriswell> NodeX: Really? Just tried it...
[07:35:04] <Rajni> hi guys, what do you guys think about ajax navigation? when is it worth using?
[07:35:16] <BillCriswell> NodeX: http://jsbin.com/oxovuy/1/edit
[07:35:52] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/bzwWs/
[07:35:54] <NodeX> works fine
[07:36:22] <BillCriswell> NodeX: It's definitely not working in Chrome here.
[07:36:50] <NodeX> both work fine on mine
[07:37:04] <Jester86> Anyone know the correct way to programmatically select an option of a select?
[07:37:04] <BillCriswell> That can't be good.
[07:37:12] <BillCriswell> Let me restart my browser.
[07:37:13] <NodeX> Version 24.0.1312.52 m
[07:37:20] <NodeX> version of mine
[07:37:51] <Jester86> I'm prepending an option which I have set as 'selected' but the select does not register a change in selection
[07:37:53] <BillCriswell> Same as me. I'm on OSX.
[07:38:18] <NodeX> Jester86 : you can change the selected prop of the <select> box if you like
[07:38:20] <myrman> Jester86: If I'm not misunderstanding you, all you need to do is set the value
[07:38:39] <BillCriswell> NodeX: http://i.imgur.com/RtCi9mU.jpg
[07:38:58] <NodeX> you can also use val() on the select box
[07:39:05] <Jester86> ?
[07:39:07] <Jester86> ahh
[07:39:10] <NodeX> BillCriswell : I could care less about macs tbh
[07:39:12] <Jester86> you mean push the value into that..
[07:39:22] <BillCriswell> NodeX: ..... Ok.
[07:39:31] <NodeX> $("#foo").val("1234");
[07:39:33] <Jester86> I was considering trying to change .options.selectedIndex
[07:40:16] <Jester86> NodeX, do you know if doing that will trigger the onchange even of the select?
[07:41:04] <Jester86> I'm trying to completely replicate a users actions
[07:41:52] <BillCriswell> Jester86: $('#some-select').val('123').trigger('change'); ?
[07:41:54] <NodeX> just trigger it programaticaly
[07:41:59] <NodeX> ^^ like that
[07:42:32] <BillCriswell> NodeX: It's still a pretty serious issue I'd say haha. It works on Safari after the select loses focus but it doesn't do that at all in Chrome.
[07:42:36] <Jester86> Is there no way to have it trigger natively?
[07:43:09] <NodeX> BillCriswell : a bug I am sure will be fixed in time
[07:43:30] <Jester86> Any of you use sharepoint at all?  Or mind giivng me your opinion on how you would do something?
[07:43:53] <NodeX> if dumb people want to go buy an overpriced laptop then they get the same treatment as Ie6 users on my site (a different experience) ;)
[07:43:58] <Jester86> I'm trying to replace a control and I'm not entirely sure how I should go about it.
[07:44:03] <Rajni> do you guys recommend any bibliographic resources to learn JQuery? is it worthy to study JQuery 1.6 books at this point?
[07:44:06] <BillCriswell> NodeX: Evil!
[07:44:15] <BillCriswell> I love my overpriced laptop that work payed for.
[07:44:22] <BillCriswell> paid*
[07:44:42] <NodeX> if Apple had their way they would not interoperate with anything, why should everyone else interoperate with them
[07:44:53] <NodeX> (in fairness this particular bug is down to chrome but hey_
[07:45:01] <Jester86> ^ like..
[07:45:01] <Jester86> lol
[07:45:07] <NoiseEee> Rajni: 1.6 is terribly old, 2.0 is about to launch.
[07:45:10] <LocalPCGuy> Rajni http://jqfundamentals.com/'
[07:45:23] <BillCriswell> It looks like it's hate Apple time. :-p
[07:45:35] <NodeX> It's always hate apple time :)
[07:45:48] <NodeX> right up there with hate Ie6 time
[07:45:55] <BillCriswell> That's a bit harsh.
[07:46:11] <NodeX> hating IE6 is harsh ?
[07:46:19] <BillCriswell> No, putting them on the same level.
[07:46:35] <fabman> I'd say it's always hate-everything-that-does-not-work time...
[07:46:50] <LocalPCGuy> IE6 <<<< Apple
[07:46:52] <Rajni> NoiseEee,LocalPCGuy Thanks ;)
[07:46:56] <BillCriswell> I've never had a problem with my over-priced laptop.
[07:47:24] <fabman> BillCriswell: same here with similar machine (MBA)
[07:47:25] <NodeX> I have never had a problem with my reasonably priced laptop :D
[07:47:49] <BillCriswell> fabman: Same. I love this damn thing.
[07:47:53] <fabman> BillCriswell: but I do long for my linux box... I'm considering installing ubuntu 12.04 on my MBA :)
[07:48:19] <NodeX> someone was trying to argue the other day that OSX is better than linux
[07:48:32] <NodeX> I'm still laughing now
[07:48:37] <BillCriswell> fabman: I don't think Linux is for me.
[07:49:26] <fabman> well... I guess it depends on the kind of development you do, and the languages u use...
[07:49:40] <karan> hello.I have slideshow code whch i hv written in jquery.In index.php i have set an iframe to display that slideshow in this iframe.but not knowing how to access jquery in iframe
[07:49:42] <BillCriswell> It all depends what you're doing with it. For development I'm sure a Linux box could be better if you took the time to really learn the in's and out's.
[07:49:43] <Jester86> Linux is for everyone..
[07:49:45] <karan> plz help me out.
[07:50:02] <fabman> BillCriswell: there's frankly not many ins and outs lately...
[07:50:15] <karan>  hello.I have slideshow code whch i hv written in jquery.In index.php i have set an iframe to display that slideshow in this iframe.but not knowing how to access jquery in iframe
[07:50:17] <systemfault> Linux has awful WMs/Desktop... and that's what counts for the average user.
[07:50:18] <BillCriswell> fabman: Well... my last go at Linux was Mandrake 8.0 I think haha.
[07:50:20] <fabman> Jester86: +1
[07:50:40] <NodeX> karan : you need $("your-iframe").find('body').contents(); ... and repeating the question will not get you help any faster
[07:50:44] <fabman> ah... that's OLD BillCriswell :)
[07:50:45] <Jester86> systemfault.. you must not be a super user then ;0
[07:50:56] <systemfault> Also, in the real world, front end programmers often need photoshop..
[07:50:59] <fabman> anyway... OT, and lunch time here, nice talking to you :)
[07:50:59] <BillCriswell> That was when I pretended I was a hacker to not get laid.
[07:51:00] <NodeX> systemfault is an idiot, dont listen to a word he says
[07:51:15] <karan> Nodex:sorry for repeatation.as  am in urgency did so .
[07:51:22] <fabman> bye now
[07:51:24] <systemfault> Jester86: I have personally no problem with Linux... as I have it on my system.
[07:52:09] <NodeX> karan : I am sure you are but it's not polite
[07:52:09] <karan> Nodex: i have tried that too.Only iframe is geting displayed.in that only first image is loaded but slideshow effect is not done
[07:52:26] <BillCriswell> when a see a letter right after a period without a space I assume it's an object. =(
[07:52:28] <karan> Nodex: its nt rude.sorry anyway
[07:52:37] <BillCriswell> rude.sorry()
[07:53:06] <karan> I would like to past my code which i have written.Can you pl check outnd find the solution?
[07:53:18] <BillCriswell> Paste it online somewhere.
[07:53:25] <BillCriswell> And if someone wants to help they will.
[07:53:30] <BillCriswell> Just give us the link.
[07:54:01] <NodeX> I have already given you the solution
[07:54:08] <mrgt> Got some divs set to contenteditble="True". Is there any way to give them placeholder text like an input field for forms?
[07:54:37] <NoiseEee> mrgt: just via scripting
[07:54:59] <BillCriswell> mrgt: Set the color of all the text to #777 ;)
[07:55:12] <karan> ohk.I will try now itself and let you know.
[07:55:16] <mrgt> NoiseEee, okay thanks. will give it a go.
[07:55:40] <mrgt> BillCriswell, ty.
[08:00:07] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:01:10] <karan> Nodex:one more doubt
[08:01:22] <karan> what does that body represent?
[08:03:27] <Lee-Lee> hi guys, how do I manipulate html added with append, it seems like jquery doesn't pick it up?
[08:04:54] <darkfrog1> hey guys, I'd like to write some JavaScript to invoke on an element when it appears (by id). Is there any way to accomplish this with jQuery apart from just doing a setTimeout?
[08:05:13] <karan> am left with one more doubt.I have jquery code for slideshow.where sud  i insert this code in index.php file?
[08:05:46] <BulleTime> Lee-Lee after append u should be able to pick it up for example with id or class
[08:06:52] <karan> where sud i put jquery code in index.php file?
[08:07:00] <Lee-Lee> BulleTime: It doesn't though?
[08:07:30] <BulleTime> i always do that
[08:08:01] <Jester86> I'm confident that listening to skrillex improves one's ability to code
[08:08:01] <Lee-Lee> I have .. <post><post> <nav> <a class="older">â€¦ the query repeats thatâ€¦ but I can't select: $('.older:last-child') it only selects the original ".older"
[08:08:16] <Lee-Lee> jquery*
[08:08:30] <karan> Nodex: r u therE?
[08:08:47] <tlkr> karan, are you talking about including the script source or writing your own functions etc?
[08:08:50] <BulleTime> what if u check the length? is that correct or?
[08:09:30] <Lee-Lee> the length of what?
[08:09:35] <systemfault> Jester86: I wonder when he's going to release new stuff though..
[08:09:38] <karan> I have jquery code.can i place that code in head tag using script tad in php file?
[08:09:44] <karan> @tlkr
[08:09:49] <Jester86> systemfault.. yeah me too :-\
[08:10:29] <Jester86> systemfault.. its probably hard finding transformers so you can record the sound of their mating
[08:10:35] <systemfault> lol
[08:10:55] <Jester86> just sayin..
[08:13:26] <tlkr> karan, you can close the php tags and paste it in yes or echo it with php
[08:14:48] <karan> I have saved jquery code in seperate file with .js extension and inlucded in php file suing script tag.
[08:14:53] <karan> @tlkr
[08:15:05] <karan> let me test if this works
[08:16:08] <karan> @tlkr: no:(   In iframe no slideshow effect on images instead getting displayed one by one.:(
[08:17:17] <Chris_CC> hey guys .. beena  while since i messed with jquery and I'm being an idiot ... any help please http://pastebin.com/Q33ShKpe i want to use the DATA from the GET instead of the STRING .. help ^^
[08:17:37] <karan> @tlkr: plz help me out!!
[08:19:10] <tlkr> karan, you cannot call javascript from the parent in an iframe

[08:39:25] <BillCriswell> Bham: You 're searching a string with your code, not a regex.
[08:39:59] <Bham> BillCriswell: Is there a way to concatenate a string to a regex code?
[08:42:18] <Bham> Oh nevermind, found the answer.
[08:43:11] <BillCriswell> Bham: Sorry, haha. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487509/passing-variable-to-a-regexp-in-javascript should help!
[08:46:28] <Hilton> $(".strata a").attr("href", "invoice.php?list=strata&strata=" + $(this).parent().attr("strata")); -- not working, I presume $(this) is incorrect. How can I refer to the parent object from within the string like that?
[08:47:26] <BillCriswell> If that's not clear and you want it inline you would do 'Welcome to {{planet}}'.replace(RegExp('{{' + id + '}}', 'g'), 'Mars');
[08:49:31] <monk3y> Hilton: I may be rusty but it should just be 'this.parent()..' etc.  No jQuery $(selector).
[08:49:58] <Hilton> Ah hell. You got it.
[08:50:03] <Hilton> You win the prize
[08:50:05] <Hilton> !
[08:50:17] * Hilton gives monk3y a big hug.
[08:50:39] <monk3y> Yaaaaaaaaay! .. ASL?
[08:50:42] <monk3y> (heheh)
[08:51:12] <lucasbonomi> Hey
[08:51:25] <Hilton> 13/f/nearU?
[08:51:29] <Hilton> j/k
[08:51:55] <BillCriswell> Did that actually work?
[08:52:02] <Hilton> Actually, no, it didn't.
[08:52:07] <lucasbonomi> I have an issue with a tiny code, i want to make my window scroll down when user click on a div, my jq works as well, but i want to animate it with jqueryUi at least, but i can't... does someone can help me .
[08:52:08] <BillCriswell> Didn't think so lol.
[08:52:16] <Hilton> I just realized it made the procedure fail.
[08:52:46] <Hilton> I was only looking for the number to reappear... it did, because it's in the old links. :P
[08:53:36] <Webgate> If someone can see my code and tells me what's wrong :/
[08:53:37] <Webgate> http://jsfiddle.net/CBkFX/
[08:53:48] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/iqajuy/1/edit is the only way I can think of approaching that.
[08:53:53] <BillCriswell> Hilton: ^
[08:54:33] <Hilton> The old file used an .click to handle links, so when the template was used in different sections it was easy to just define a new .click. It was because of a "tile" view, wanted the whole thing to be clickable. Now trying to get rid of stupid things like that, so doing it properly with a surrounding <a> block tag, but I've hit the stumbling block of changing the URLs.
[08:54:44] <Webgate> Does someone is able to help me ?
[08:55:03] <monk3y> Hilton: Sorry if it didn't work, I'm glad I predicated my response with rustiness.
[08:55:48] <BillCriswell> Hilton: http://jsbin.com/ilufav/1/edit Nevermind, this could work.
[08:55:52] <monk3y> Webgate: why do you think it's 'wrong'?  What is it [not ] doing that you think it should[n't] be?
[08:56:08] <BillCriswell> Easier to read, in my opinion.
[08:56:13] <Hilton> Billcrisswell: That approach won't work either...?
[08:56:22] <BillCriswell> No that works.
[08:56:41] <Hilton> No, each subsequent item gets the attribute of the first row.
[08:57:08] <lucasbonomi> So i guess you guys didn't read my problem :/
[08:57:33] <Hilton> It WORKS, but every row is &strata=1 instead of &strata=174, &strata=241, etc.
[08:57:52] <Hilton> If I remove my first entry (1), they all become &strata=174
[08:58:43] <lucasbonomi> So i repeat, i develop a tiny function do let a clicked div makes a scrolldown with animation...
[08:59:00] <lucasbonomi> here is my code, and i can't make the animation... http://jsfiddle.net/CBkFX/
[08:59:03] <motaka2> Hello, I can,t get the alert working in this code - What the problem is ?http://pastebin.com/1kMYLxMw
[08:59:07] <karan> anyone can help me out?!
[08:59:12] <BillCriswell> Hilton: Didn't know there was more than one.
[08:59:20] <BillCriswell> Hilton: http://jsbin.com/ilufav/1/edit Just go through each one and do it.
[08:59:21] <monk3y> lucasbonomi: sorry dude, was looking at another issue and your original preamble had disappeared in the buffer before I saw it.
[08:59:23] <BillCriswell> Like that.
[09:00:10] <BillCriswell> I might be misunderstanding something.
[09:00:17] <lucasbonomi> hm, np, but i really don't get it ...
[09:00:19] <BillCriswell> I'm going to get food. Maybe that'll help.
[09:01:28] <karan> if anyone, check my files: slideshow.js file  : check here: http://pastebin.com/TPqM2q4L  and check index.php file here: http://pastebin.com/guVdakRG
[09:01:39] <Hilton> BillCriswell: Got it. Did exactly that, but without the inner function - link.attr('href', 'inv...' + $(this).parent().attr('strata'));
[09:01:49] <rotham> hey.. anyone familiar with uniform?

[09:02:20] <Hilton> Got rid of the variable too.
[09:02:27] <rotham> since it is screwing up on some parts of my page...
[09:02:30] <Hilton> I never remember .each :P
[09:02:41] <BillCriswell> Hilton: Happens.

[09:13:00] <devOlsen> lucasbonomi, try scrolling the document, not the body. http://jsfiddle.net/CBkFX/7/
[09:13:19] <rabx> Not sure if this is the right room but I wanted to start using the twitter bootstrap. So I went to customize and download (everything). In one of the demos it links to various javascript files yet in the file I downloaded (everything) did not include these files such as  /js/bootstrap-collapse.js
[09:15:17] <rabx> Maybe their demos haven't been updated which is why it's confusing - see the source code towards the bottom http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/examples/hero.html and then try to download it... the files are missing
[09:17:55] <karan> my time is screwd up already
[09:18:55] <iksik> hello
[09:19:26] <karan> expecting some help
[09:19:51] <iksik> is it possible to create something like: $(myObject).find('*').live('hover',function(){}); ?
[09:20:57] <tlkr> karan, the people in this channel are unpaid members of the community who will assist you if they have time. I am sorry you are having problems but please don't try not to take that attitude with us.
[09:21:09] <tlkr> i think that will work iksik, try it.
[09:21:10] <motaka2> Hello, I can,t get the alert working in this code - What the problem is ?http://pastebin.com/1kMYLxMw    , it says Sol.Dss.Modify is not defined
[09:21:24] <anew> lmao karan
[09:21:31] <iksik> tlkr: well it doesn't :(
[09:21:37] <tlkr> iksik, you don't necessarily need to do that as the event will bubble up to the parent element.
[09:21:41] <iksik> tlkr: it throws: TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'live'
[09:21:42] <Hilton> Is there a jQueryUI element / plugin which will provide a nice item navigation bar? I'm talking about a first/prev/next/last bar
[09:21:54] <Hilton> Or should I just try to style my existing one using jqui classes?
[09:22:23] <iksik> tlkr: i'm using stopPropagation in the last element, and i'm removing parent class, so it works ok, but this 'live' thing does not work ;/
[09:22:28] <karan> @tlkr:hmm
[09:22:39] <karan> @anew: tellme
[09:23:50] <tlkr> iksik binding to the hover event on the parent object will have exactly the same effect as binding to the hover event on all of the children elements except that the function wil only run once.
[09:23:59] <iksik> oh
[09:24:06] <tlkr> hover bubbles up the dom tree.
[09:24:12] <iksik> and children objects can be added/removed on the fly?
[09:24:30] <tlkr> if you do .on to the parent element (assuming it is not created dynamically) then yes.
[09:24:37] <iksik> i'm working with contentWindow of some web editor
[09:25:21] <iksik> hmmm
[09:25:28] <anew> karan i'm not telling u with that attitude lol
[09:25:29] <tlkr> i think hover bubbles anyway
[09:25:38] <iksik> it hovers only main object ;/
[09:25:48] <anew> i'm not as nice as everyone else in here, i just tell people like you to screw off
[09:26:12] <karan> anew: ok.do your work now.
[09:26:41] <tlkr> karan, as I said, a bad attitude will not get you help.
[09:26:44] <iksik> hm, hm, hmm
[09:27:13] <karan> @tlkr:plz say this to anew.he/she pinged me
[09:27:14] <b-ot> karan, I am not in this.
[09:27:49] <karan> and sorry.@tlkr.
[09:28:59] <anew> to me? lol
[09:29:09] <anew> i just said i dont help people with bad attitudes
[09:29:17] <anew> anyway waste of time arguing in here
[09:30:56] <karan> anew: thts y am not arguing with u :)

[09:52:55] <codecowboy> is there a way to empty a jquerymobile slider's range value on focus and have it remember the value on blur?
[10:00:03] <is_null> hi all, anybody ever faced a case where you have to double-click in order to trigger a click event ? it's happening to me on an autocomplete menu
[10:00:44] <is_null> i'm thinking maybe the first click is used by the browser to focus back on the html menu, and the second one is actually interpreted as a click call
[10:00:53] <alicefreak> I want to change <p> tag contents. Here is jsfiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/rK34t/6/. Can anyone help? thanks
[10:02:53] <billiam> Is there still an api.xml file maintained for the current docs?
[10:08:46] <smill> I'm using mouseenter and mouseleave on a <li> of which i specified its height and width, and I notice that it doesn't work until it gets a couple of pixels inside the square, is there a way to expand the area that it works in?
[10:09:39] <tlkr> is_null, try using the select event rather than click.
[10:11:00] <EweR> good evening lads
[10:12:21] <EweR> var editText = $("select[name='editText']").text();   <- I tried this to get the text of selected option in from select box to variable, but it put all the available options in the varibale, any fix?
[10:14:23] <NodeX> val();
[10:14:33] <NodeX> not text();
[10:14:39] <EweR> i dont need value
[10:14:52] <EweR> i need whats between <option></option>
[10:14:54] <NodeX> you didn't say that did you
[10:15:21] <Gho5t> calm down
[10:15:28] <NodeX> eh?
[10:16:02] <tlkr> EweR, try $("select[name='editText']").children('option[selected="selected"]').text()
[10:17:04] <EweR> tlkr, worked like magic, thanks :)
[10:17:05] <tlkr> and good evening also :)
[10:17:12] <EweR> ;)
[10:18:53] <LukyVj> Hi, i have a little issue with an animation, in fact, i do a little development, it works like this : When user click on a specific div, it makes the body scrollDown, and it works.. but i want to make it with a smooth animation and i can't reach it :(     (sorry for the english level, i'm just a french guy..)
[10:22:15] <nvartolomei> LukyVj: how do you make body to scroll?
[10:22:19] <LukyVj> http://jsfiddle.net/CBkFX/8/
[10:22:31] <LukyVj> nvartolomei: http://jsfiddle.net/CBkFX/8/
[10:23:58] <LukyVj> By the way, i tried to implement JqUi for the animations, but nothing works :(
[10:24:15] <Lee-Lee> Hi guys, still battling with this.. I've got this code: http://pastebin.com/R8ELKJsj basically when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, an ajax function is called using the url from the ".older" link which returns more posts (infinite scrolling) and then another .older link at the botttom.. But jQuery doesn't seem to notice append ".older" links?
[10:24:51] <LukyVj> .old ?
[10:24:56] <is_null> tlkr: thanks
[10:25:46] <is_null> nope, that's not it
[10:26:11] <nvartolomei> LukyVj: http://jsfiddle.net/FC55v/
[10:26:19] <Lee-Lee> LukyVj: .older is the link to older posts...
[10:27:52] <LukyVj> nvartolomei: Dude ! you rocks ! thannnks !
[10:28:05] <rindolf> Hi all.
[10:28:15] <javascripter> hi
[10:29:22] <tlkr> can you jsfiddle your code is_null
[10:29:29] <tlkr> hi rindolf
[10:40:40] <LukyVj> nvartolomei: Can i bother you once again ?
[10:40:48] <nvartolomei> LukyVj: sure
[10:42:49] <BillCriswell> Ugh.
[10:42:57] <BillCriswell> Today just went way south.
[10:44:21] <LukyVj> nvartolomei: when you say, ( .animate({scrollBottom:$(document).height()} ) is it possible to write something like ( .negativeHeight()}) or something ?
[10:44:35] <nvartolomei> why?
[10:45:07] <LukyVj> nvartolomei: to reverse the process and make it goes up ?
[10:46:52] <nvartolomei> when you do this you scroll to an absolute position on page
[10:47:23] <syncLock> loha all
[10:48:27] <nvartolomei> so do your math to get this position and scroll to it
[10:57:31] <Nece228> hi, anyone know why jquery cant find image url?
[10:57:33] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/MVmkz/
[10:58:09] <NoiseEee> Nece228: sorry, whats that code supposed to be doing?
[10:58:58] <Nece228> i need to get image file name and then place it in variable
[10:59:19] <NoiseEee> the question seems unrelated to code you pasted
[10:59:45] <CoJaBo> Is there a listing of which releases break backwards-compatibility with which others?
[11:00:22] <rindolf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14445372/feature-detection-redirect-for-msie-below-10-happens-after-loading-a-different - hi all, if anyone can answer, he'll get some SO rep.
[11:00:33] <Nece228> NoiseEee: yeah the code part is copy pasted, basically i have <a href="img/svogunas.jpg" rel="lightbox"> in my html, want to get svogunas.jpg in jquery
[11:00:49] <NoiseEee> Nece228: so you're asking someone to write the code?
[11:01:05] <Nece228> oh gosh
[11:01:13] <Nece228> alert($(this).closest().attr('href'));
[11:01:34] <Nece228> this line should find it
[11:01:36] <Nece228> but it doesnt
[11:01:40] <NoiseEee> how should that line find it
[11:01:45] <NoiseEee> what is "this"
[11:01:48] <NoiseEee> ?
[11:02:21] <NoiseEee> Nece228: replace it with a better reference to the DOM element you seek.
[11:03:03] <Nece228> http://jsfiddle.net/MVmkz/1/
[11:03:29] <NoiseEee> the closest *what*
[11:04:30] <NoiseEee> Nece228: also you'll probably have to test with something resembling valid html
[11:05:05] <Nece228> jsfiddle messes up things, delete button should be in td same as two inputs: svogunas and '5'
[11:05:19] <NoiseEee> you have content in a <tr> tag.
[11:05:30] <NoiseEee> either way, closest is going up ancestors in the DOM tree; that's not what you want.
[11:06:43] <Nece228> yeah, so what i should do?
[11:10:54] <Nece228> <tr><td><img src="img/svogunas.jpg"></td><td><button id="button"></td></tr>
[11:11:16] <Nece228> how im supposed to get value of "src" when pressing button
[11:12:32] <Nece228> im asumming i should do $(this).parent().attr('src'), so it searches in <tr> because its parent element, but it doesnt work
[11:13:55] <NoiseEee> Nece228: the parent of the button is what
[11:14:11] <Nece228> oh yeah its <td> right?
[11:14:14] <NoiseEee> right.
[11:14:23] <NoiseEee> and not the cell that has the <a> either
[11:14:25] <Nece228> but then even when doing parent().parent() it still doesnt work
[11:15:19] <thang> the parent of the td is...
[11:16:00] <Nece228> oh i start to get it, so it searches for attribute inside <tr> tag
[11:16:05] <NoiseEee> var allTDs = $(this).parents('td').siblings();
[11:16:31] <Nece228> and i need to search inside <tr> tag
[11:16:33] <NoiseEee> now, "find" the a tag within those elements... there's only one, so you can call the .attr('href') directly.
[11:16:55] <NoiseEee> Nece228: the only thing inside a <tr> tag is <td> elements;  so siblings are fine
[11:18:03] <Nece228> yeah, correct
[11:18:15] <NoiseEee> soooo....
[11:18:17] <LukyVJ> Hi, i have this http://jsfiddle.net/ugyDT/ and i don't get how to proceed to goes at the top of the document by clicking the second arrow.. anyone can explain ?
[11:18:23] <Drewch> What was the version just prior to the latest core update?
[11:18:25] <Nece228> im sorry i didnt do any coding for more than 3 months
[11:18:27] <Drewch> was it 1.8.3?
[11:18:33] <NoiseEee> yep Drewch
[11:18:41] <jacks_appendix> How come I can't download jquery ui widgets on their own?
[11:18:52] <Drewch> Thanks, do you know if anyone complained about bootstrap plugins failing after the update?
[11:23:18] <LukyVJ> Nobody ?
[11:23:18] <NoiseEee> Drewch: 1.9 is a significant update. you should review http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[11:23:31] <NoiseEee> Drewch: and make use of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/
[11:24:05] <Drewch> Thanks
[11:24:07] <Drewch> will do
[11:24:44] <Drewch> I was linking to code.jquery.com/jquery-min.js =\
[11:24:48] <Drewch> without a version, so I got screwed
[11:25:43] <NoiseEee> yes that is always a dangerous, dangerous move
[11:27:30] <mrgt> Can someone explain why I'm getting undefined when using the focusout event? http://pastebin.com/QDuFcUga
[11:27:37] <Drewch> NoiseEee yup I was silly back then
[11:28:48] <Joskar> Hi guys - is there a plugin around for handling  tabs with "dl" instead of "ul" ?
[11:39:15] <guy> after doing var frag = $(); frag.push( $('<li>').text('foo') ); frag.push( $('<li>').text('foo') ); $('ul').append(frag);
[11:39:32] <guy> what's the proper way of constructing HTML with empty jQuery object?
[11:40:22] <NoiseEee> guy: frag can just be an array, not a jquery object.
[11:40:36] <NoiseEee> guy: and then you can join it and append it to $('ul')
[11:40:57] <guy> I am pretty sure I've used jQuery like this before..
[11:40:58] <guy> like 90%
[11:40:59] <NoiseEee> var frag = [];  //etc    $('ul').append(frag.join())
[11:41:22] <guy> Thinking where was it.
[11:43:36] <svcghost_> Hey guys, how would I check all the input elements on my page with ID's color1, color2, color3, etc. to check if their value is 0?
[11:43:46] <svcghost_> So far I have this: if ($('[id^="color"]').val(0))
[11:44:38] <systemfault> You will need a .each
[11:44:39] <guy> NoiseEee: var frag = $(); frag = frag.add( $('<li>').text('foo') ); frag = frag.add( $('<li>').text('foo') ); $('ul').append(frag);
[11:44:42] <guy> this works
[11:45:11] <systemfault> svcghost_: and .val(0) would set their value to 0..
[11:49:29] <Lindrian> how can I debounce an event? I use $(foo).bind('event1 event2', function(e) { });
[11:49:53] <Lindrian> (I want to limit execution to like once every x ms, throttling might be better)
[11:51:56] <svcghost_> systemfault: what would  this do? if ($('[id^="color"]').val() == 0)
[11:52:17] <svcghost_> Check the first seen input with id = "colorx" and check if its value is 0?
[11:52:22] <svcghost_> only the first though
[11:52:25] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:52:59] <svcghost_> Okay that makes sense. Now I'm having trouble getting it to check all of the known inputs with id="colorx" . The .each iterator :-\
[11:53:08] <Nece228> NoiseEee: dont you think that it looks a bit too "fat"? $(this).parent().siblings().find('a').attr('href')
[11:53:25] <Nece228> it seems its a lot of going forward and backward
[11:53:49] <BillCriswell> svcghost_: $('[id^="color"]').each(function(){ if( $(this).val() == 0 ) { });
[11:54:25] <NoiseEee> Nece228: put an ID on the <a> or the <td> if you like; feel free to make identification easier.  or, traverse the DOM.
[11:57:46] <innociv> Why am I getting a number like "0.43000000000000005" when I subtract .12 from .55?
[11:58:33] <Nece228> NoiseEee: great tips, thanks
[11:58:33] <shealyw2> i am new to jquery, is all i need that one file jquery.min.js?
[11:59:17] <innociv> nevermind
[11:59:54] <svcghost_> Thank you BillCriswell , very much. Now is there a way to break that function if it does find any values 0
[12:00:00] <svcghost_> So it doesn't go through the rest of the inputs
[12:00:14] <BillCriswell> svcghost_: return false
[12:00:19] <svcghost_> thanks bro
[12:00:22] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[12:03:35] <raj> will people laugh at me if I use .success() instead of .done()?
[12:03:51] <jrockjiggz> raj: no?
[12:04:48] <raj> k
[12:05:14] <raj> jrockjiggz, why doesn't this say the arguments that are passed to the functions passed to .done()?
[12:05:17] <raj> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[12:05:50] <NoiseEee> raj: you should not be writing modern code using deprecated functions.
[12:06:35] <NoiseEee> meaning, if you want to use the just-released 1.9....
[12:07:40] <raj> NoiseEee, how is that deprecated?
[12:07:48] <yannickoo> hey guys, can you tell me how i have to change the css so that the animation is _not_ smooth? http://jsfiddle.net/y5J85/
[12:07:51] <raj> i thought that's the new thing
[12:08:12] <raj> to use instead of a 'success' key in the object passed to $.ajax
[12:08:51] <systemfault> It is...
[12:09:01] <NoiseEee> raj: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:09:27] <NoiseEee> raj: "The jqXHR Object", a few lines down, biiiig text: Deprecation Notice
[12:09:43] <systemfault> raj: The promise interface is prefered... but if you really prefer callbacks..
[12:09:49] <scriptraptor> Hi, what's the proper way to do something like jQuery('#mydiv').children('nth-child(2)'); ?
[12:10:24] <BillCriswell> scriptraptor: $('#mydiv *:eq(2)') maybe?
[12:10:38] <BillCriswell> scriptraptor: $('#mydiv > *:eq(2)') Actually.
[12:10:45] <scriptraptor> BillCriswell: thanks w here did you get eq(2) from?
[12:11:08] <BillCriswell> scriptraptor: http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[12:11:13] <scriptraptor> thanks
[12:11:30] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[12:11:30] <Mottie> isn't the "*" implied? You should be able to do $('#mydiv > :eq(2)')
[12:11:42] <scriptraptor> i'd assume it was implied myself
[12:11:45] <BillCriswell> Probably haha.
[12:11:51] <scriptraptor> i'll test it out for you
[12:11:51] <rmill> for helpy helpers: you can use b-ot to check jQuery api stuffs
[12:11:55] <rmill> `api eq
[12:11:56] <b-ot> rmill, .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[12:12:10] <rmill> @api find
[12:12:10] <b-ot> rmill, .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[12:12:22] <BillCriswell> How would you get the selector instead?
[12:12:24] <rmill> RIP bot-t
[12:12:32] <raj> thanks NoiseEee
[12:12:37] <scriptraptor> can i use this :eq thing in children() or find()?
[12:12:38] <BillCriswell> `api :eq
[12:12:38] <b-ot> BillCriswell, :eq() Selector: Select the element at index <code>n</code> within the matched set. http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[12:12:41] <BillCriswell> Oh nice.
[12:12:48] <NoiseEee> np raj
[12:13:01] <rmill> ?api appendTo @ BillCriswell
[12:13:01] <b-ot> BillCriswell, .appendTo(): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[12:13:03] <systemfault> :/
[12:13:04] <raj> NoiseEee, so what're the arguments .done() provides the for the functions its passed?
[12:13:12] <rmill> BillCriswell: :D
[12:13:46] <systemfault> raj: result, message, jqXhr  IIRC
[12:13:54] <liox_> Hello I would like to know how to create a navigation for SEO ajax putting #! in the url?
[12:13:57] <raj> systemfault, how come I don't see it in the docs?
[12:14:22] <systemfault> raj: It's there: jqXHR.done(function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {});
[12:14:33] <scriptraptor> BillCriswell: your answer won't work as I have already got a jquery var. var $my = jQuery('#mydiv'); $my.children('nth-child(2)'); how could i do it this way?
[12:14:48] <raj> oh, right
[12:14:48] <systemfault> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ Just a bit after half the page
[12:14:51] <raj> thanks
[12:15:00] <BillCriswell> $my.find('> :eq(2)')
[12:15:12] <xboi209> I copy and pasted jQuery into my userscript and also made the userscript load a .js file off the internet which also uses jQuery. The problem is that jQuery code loaded from the .js file can't use the jQuery I packed into my userscript
[12:15:15] <xboi209> anyone have any ideas?
[12:15:17] <raj> jrockjiggz, so btw, people will laugh if I used .success()!
[12:15:28] <systemfault> raj: .done/.fail/.always are not deprecated... only the older .success/.error/.complete are
[12:15:42] <scriptraptor> BillCriswell: <3 that is all
[12:15:48] <raj> gotcha, thank you
[12:16:14] <gdoteof> using $('#selector').click(<function>); when i use an anonymous function for <function> it works fine; but if i try and put in the name of a function defined elsewhere, it seems to call that function immediately rather than do the bdining
[12:16:18] <gdoteof> am i doing something wrong?
[12:16:42] <LocalPCGuy> gdoteof jsfiddle?
[12:17:07] <systemfault> gdoteof: Pass it the function name, not the call... (  myFunction and not myFunction() )
[12:17:36] <gdoteof> systemfault: oh.  yeah that is def my prob >.<
[12:18:36] <Mottie> xboi209: check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2246901/how-can-i-use-jquery-in-greasemonkey-scripts-in-google-chrome/
[12:18:58] <xboi209> would it solve the problem of my external .js file not being able to use jQuery?
[12:19:29] <gdoteof> thanks
[12:22:58] <scriptraptor> BillCriswell: I try to figure something out for 3 hrs, then you answer with this and i'm done in 5 mins
[12:23:21] <BillCriswell> scriptraptor: Wish I could answer my shit in 5 minutes. =(
[12:26:16] <rmill> ?api ajax
[12:26:17] <b-ot> rmill, no matches.

[12:26:41] <rmill> hnggh
[12:26:59] <scriptraptor> btw guys, within your jquery code, do you tend to use jQuery or $. when i'm naming local jquery objects with $ prefix, a single $ call might be a bit hard to spot?
[12:27:56] <LocalPCGuy> I always use $
[12:28:14] <tw2113> i use $ when i can, and alias it when i have to
[12:28:21] <Mottie> xboi209: yes, but make sure you use jQuery.noConflict() so it doesn't interfere with other libraries
[12:28:29] <scriptraptor> tw2113: when do you decide to alias?
[12:28:43] <LocalPCGuy> I wrap my code in an object literal that I pass jQuery into and assign it to $
[12:28:52] <Mottie> xboi209: but make sure you detect if jQuery is already on the page before loading in another version.
[12:29:26] <LocalPCGuy> something like: (function($){ var myCode = {}; }(jQuery, undefined));
[12:29:29] <tw2113> i frequently use jQuery(document).ready(function($){ });
[12:29:44] <tw2113> and then $ inside the whole time
[12:29:55] <tw2113> i work with WordPress a lot, so a good idea
[12:30:47] <LocalPCGuy> why not the document ready shortcut?  jQuery(function(){});
[12:31:27] <tw2113> because i'm picky
[12:34:49] <Alina-malina> hello everyone!
[12:34:56] <svcghost_> BillCriswell: Hey man. So I see what this .each iterator did for me, but I have a little issue. Instead of iterating through each input with id = "colorX", is there a way to just check if any input at all with id = "colorX" has a value of 0?
[12:35:42] <BillCriswell> [id^=color][value=0] might work?
[12:35:45] <svcghost_> Because my issue comes into play when there are two inputs on the screen with colorX as the ID. It checks the first one, which doesn't have value 0, and it creates an input
[12:35:51] <svcghost_> Let me try
[12:36:53] <Alina-malina> I have a div with php variable in it, so i want it tomake it  periodically updated, how can i do this?
[12:37:35] <wroathe> tw2113: Rather than using noconflict I typically wrap my code inside of a self-invoking anonymous function... (function (window, $, undefined) {}(window, jQuery));
[12:38:00] <BillCriswell> svcghost_: http://jsbin.com/uhotaq/1/edit worked!
[12:38:02] <wroathe> tw2113: Solves the namespace collision problem without the need to wait for the document's ready status.
[12:38:19] <tw2113> whatever works
[12:40:49] <Alina-malina> How can i update it?
[12:40:52] <tw2113> we all have our preferences
[12:41:15] <awc737> is this proper json: ["aluminum,windows","wood,doors"]
[12:41:46] <BillCriswell> svcghost_: Just noticed it updates what I'm messing around with haha.
[12:41:50] <tw2113> jsonlint says yes awc737
[12:41:55] <tw2113> http://jsonlint.com/
[12:41:58] <Alina-malina> i use codeigniter and i dont json encode it, can i make it update?
[12:42:00] <awc737> hmm
[12:42:24] <awc737> tw2113, when I do $.each( function on that , I get each letter alerted back to me
[12:42:26] <svcghost_> BillCriswell:  I think I'm on to something after your last suggestion
[12:42:31] <awc737> $.each(filter.mappings, function(m, mapping){ alert(mapping.uris);
[12:42:31] <svcghost_> I'll let you know if it works
[12:42:32] <BillCriswell> svcghost_: $('[id^=color][value=0]') was the selector, though. Trying to code up something a bit.
[12:42:36] <awc737> prints each letter not each object
[12:42:47] <tw2113> try wrapping it in {}
[12:43:11] <tw2113> almost
[12:43:14] <tw2113> that invalidated it
[12:43:26] <awc737> hmm
[12:43:53] <breakingthings> Question for anyone familiar enough with event binding: I need to delay a form submit from occurring until a _gaq.push() has completedâ€¦ The only way I can think of would be to use _gaq.push(function(){}); which executes in order, causing it to wait until the previous _gaq.push finishes, but then I can't return true to finish up, so what should I doâ€¦?
[12:44:00] <BillCriswell> svcghost_: http://jsbin.com/uhotaq/2/edit
[12:44:02] <awc737> tw2113, what do you think?
[12:44:16] <tw2113> *shrug* i'm debugging my own things, so i'm only doing quick answers
[12:45:32] <svcghost_> Hold one sec
[12:45:38] <svcghost_> If this doesn't work, I will check out your solution
[12:45:45] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[12:46:11] <svcghost_> How can I use   $('[id^=color][value=0]')   to check if there are no inputs with the ID colorX and value=0
[12:46:23] <svcghost_> would it be    if(!$('[id^=color][value=0]').val().length > 0)
[12:47:02] <awc737> why does a $.each loop on this object, print each letter, instead of each item: ["aluminum,windows","wood,doors"]
[12:47:04] <svcghost_> no nevermind
[12:47:18] <svcghost_> that would not even grab a selector given there are none with value=0
[12:47:35] <svcghost_> Oh wait I got it
[12:48:44] <BillCriswell> svcghost_: You don't want the val.
[12:49:20] <BillCriswell> $('[id^=color][value=0]').length would be truthy if there's any 0 values.
[12:50:15] <svcghost_> Yay I got it
[12:50:19] <svcghost_> Thank you very much BillCriswell
[12:50:22] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[12:50:46] <svcghost_> :)
[13:03:41] <breakingthings> Can anyone help me with: http://jsfiddle.net/UAtbs/ (Google Analytics + click events)

[13:05:19] <shoky> awc737: wrong order
[13:05:34] <shoky> and also,

[13:07:02] <someprimetime> ah :(
[13:07:04] <shoky> (i had no idea you were talkin to him till you said it ;p)
[13:07:11] <BillCriswell> He's just a damn spring with a hand attached guys.
[13:07:15] <someprimetime> ok you win by a technicality
[13:07:18] <shoky> ;D
[13:07:29] <someprimetime> don't be too proud of it!!
[13:08:14] <shoky> meh, helped enough people here to feel proud if i should feel like it ;p
[13:08:32] <someprimetime> haha yep +1 you do good work
[13:09:48] <shoky> anyway yours had !== -1
[13:09:55] <shoky> so we uh.. complement one another
[13:10:26] <shoky> not sure i needed to go that far
[13:10:40] <shoky> but i can go further still
[13:14:47] <breakingthings> pls #jquery. ehlp.
[13:15:06] <saimon69> hi need somebody to tell me what am doing wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/Pe9SM/
[13:15:31] <saimon69> i can move up down and remove elements but the functions dont work in new generated elements
[13:16:03] <saimon69> so i wonder if am inserting those divs in the DOM properly
[13:16:27] <breakingthings> saimon69: are you registering those functions on those new elements?
[13:16:38] <saimon69> how?
[13:16:38] <breakingthings> doesn't look like it.
[13:16:47] <breakingthings> same way as you did initially
[13:16:53] <breakingthings> you have to register the events on the new objects
[13:16:58] <saimon69> well is linkrd to the class not to the div
[13:17:05] <breakingthings> jquery doesn't register the event listeners to the class
[13:17:08] <saimon69> thought was enough
[13:17:14] <breakingthings> it registers them to the individual elements
[13:17:32] <saimon69> mean everytime i have to redo the whole onclick thing?
[13:17:39] <breakingthings> no, just for the new element
[13:18:15] <saimon69> well need to duplicate it in the function then? i want something generic not linked to the index or id
[13:18:41] <breakingthings> but for the record, $('div').on('click', function(){ $(this).css({color: '#f00'}); }); registers to all the divs on the current page, but as soon as you add a new div it won't have that click event
[13:19:04] <saimon69> is enough to replicate it in the function?
[13:19:12] <breakingthings> in the createNew() method? Yes.
[13:19:34] <breakingthings> [â€¦].appendTo().on('click', function(){/* â€¦ */});
[13:19:47] <breakingthings> and it will register the click even onto that new element
[13:19:51] <saimon69> yep you were right
[13:20:03] <breakingthings> :)
[13:20:04] <saimon69> done in a more prolix way but the important is that work
[13:20:08] <breakingthings> yeah
[13:20:40] <breakingthings> Just gotta remember, $('selector') returns an array of objects, and any function chained to that is always done to the individual elements, not the selector itself
[13:20:41] <saimon69> but now seems to have another problem
[13:20:58] <saimon69> seems the index is not going up or down properly
[13:20:59] <breakingthings> array of elements*
[13:21:41] <saimon69> it jumps either to the top or to the bottom when i do move up or movedown
[13:21:55] <saimon69> i need increment/decrement by 1
[13:23:37] <breakingthings> saimon69: code?
[13:23:49] <saimon69> http://jsfiddle.net/Pe9SM/2/
[13:24:12] <raj> can I make a function that listens to an array, and if there's a change to that array, it runs a callback?
[13:25:12] <breakingthings> saimon69: you don't have to do all thatâ€¦ one sec.
[13:26:16] <saimon69> breakiungthings: am trying to build a form maker and to move fields up and down so need to work with the dynamically generated ones; so far i built this test in a couple of days
[13:27:46] <breakingthings> saimon69: http://jsfiddle.net/Pe9SM/3/
[13:27:56] <breakingthings> not sure that fixes your problem with the indexes
[13:28:15] <breakingthings> but it's more efficient to select just that new element
[13:28:22] <breakingthings> than to reapply the event to all the elements again
[13:28:50] <breakingthings> also, you should move that var index stuff into your functions
[13:29:38] <oliwe> im using draggable and resizable on a div, how do i get the values it does?
[13:31:16] <breakingthings> saimon69: http://jsfiddle.net/Pe9SM/4/ check what I've done with moveUp()
[13:31:28] <breakingthings> now the click events are just calling moveUp(this)
[13:31:38] <breakingthings> and moveUp can figure out the index and everything on it's own.
[13:32:24] <breakingthings> Also, still looking for help on this click event conundrum http://jsfiddle.net/UAtbs/
[13:35:01] <Fallout2man> Question regarding developing in iFrames. I need to be able to conditionally Apply a style override to a page when an iFrame is present. My problem is this. I have NO access directly to the parent frame. I'm developing for a Platform built on Mobile Safari called Skura.
[13:35:14] <Fallout2man> Our client is requesting on certain pages to move the default UI, contained in the parent iFrame.
[13:35:27] <NoiseEee> Fallout2man: no can do
[13:35:31] <Fallout2man> There are NO uniform page enter or leave events
[13:35:38] <Fallout2man> So I have no real idea what to do
[13:35:49] <Fallout2man> Originally I made a JS fix but that affects the parent even on pages we don't want.
[13:36:15] <Fallout2man> NoiseEee: I figured ;_; I just had to try here to be sure first.
[13:36:21] <NoiseEee> how did you make a JS fix?
[13:36:46] <Fallout2man> NoiseEee: I can modify the Navbar's CSS from within jQuery really simply.
[13:37:26] <NoiseEee> if you're on the same domain, you can window.parent from the iframe
[13:37:44] <Fallout2man> NoiseEee: $('.navbar', parent.document).css() works like a charm, but works a bit too well. Their platform re-uses the same session across presentations for its standard UI. So we ran into a problem in that if we move the Navbar it stays across multiple pages.
[13:38:54] <NoiseEee> what about taking its original layout details, saving them, and re-implementing them before navigating away (somehow, thining out loud)
[13:38:57] <Fallout2man> NoiseEee: What we need is a way to only on certain pages change the UI, but as we can't alter the platform itself that severely limits our options. We can't rely on JS events because there are a thousand ways to leave the page that we can't track due to this being Mobile Safari and Skura not bothering to provide a comprehensive Mobile Event API.
[13:39:38] <dcherman> Fallout2man: can you just bind to the "load" event and change the page state based on the loaded url, or do you have no access to the parent page?
[13:40:28] <thinboy>  How can I sum up image widths in jquery?
[13:40:31] <Fallout2man> dcherman: I have no direct access, no. I can make modifications with jQuery but I have no guarantee as to what the API will do with those changes. Originally my hope was that there'd be some way for me to make child CSS filter up to the parent document in a non-permenant way.
[13:40:44] <Fallout2man> Sadly injecting the style sheets just meant the style persisted across documents, same problem.
[13:40:52] <Fallout2man> Also
[13:40:53] <saimon69> breakingthings: thanks, sorry gotta go to a meeting
[13:41:10] <saimon69> and need to quit however thanks
[13:41:11] <svcghost_> Hello. How can you use jQuery to add a <br /> after the div (given you have the selector for the DIV
[13:41:17] <breakingthings> np saimon69
[13:41:20] <svcghost_> I know innerHTML but that is within the div.. how about directly after the div
[13:41:22] <saimon69> :)
[13:43:04] <Fallout2man> dcherman: But the big issue is that they don't want to maintain it in a centralized list. They've given me specific functionality requirements. They want a code snippet they can add or remove to any single presentation which makes changes to the UI that persist only across that presentation. The framework provided does not appear to make this possible though.
[13:43:38] <Fallout2man> dcherman: I can only directly write child documents that will be inserted into the framework.
[13:44:09] <zfly9> hey guys rookie here, is it possible to use .toggleClass to have a hover on one element change a non-child element?
[13:44:31] <dcherman> Fallout2man: what about a style node with a known id - when you change pages, remove that node from the parent and insert a new one.
[13:45:11] <Fallout2man> dcherman: No satisfactory event UI ;_; If there was I'd just do a manual style overwrite on the element itself and then return it to its original values on page exit.
[13:45:30] <Fallout2man> The page can exit in several ways and only some of them will generate events.
[13:45:47] <dcherman> Fallout2man: the page is an iframe isn't it?
[13:46:09] <Fallout2man> dcherman: Yes, that's correct.
[13:46:56] <dcherman> Fallout2man: so there is a consistent set of events that you can use - onload, DOMContentLoaded, onbeforeunload
[13:47:35] <dcherman> Fallout2man: or since you have access to the parent window, attach an event listener to the iframe from your script that changes some class on the body to match your new state
[13:48:16] <Fallout2man> dcherman: Okay I guess I'll give that a try. I don't have direct access to the JS source they use so I'm unsure of if this will break anything but it's sure worth a shot! Thanks! :)
[13:48:23] <scriptraptor> Does jquery use css styling on fadeIn or is it all javascript?
[13:51:12] <b-ot> wee
[13:53:41] <mads-> I was in here asking about this. But I'm still not entirely sure. What is the advantage of attaching a function to the jquery object? Like $.mynewfunction = function() {...}
[13:54:58] <breakingthings> Still looking for assistance with: http://jsfiddle.net/UAtbs/
[13:55:05] <breakingthings> (pretty please?)
[13:55:20] <breakingthings> Also I've discovered returning _gaq.push definitely doesn't work
[13:55:23] <breakingthings> :(
[14:02:08] <smill> i need a tutorial for having a drop down menu that when you hover over items it can display a sub-menu out to the right, any suggestions on what to google for?
[14:03:45] <NoiseEee> smill "flyout menu jquery"
[14:06:12] <smill> noiseeee: thanks
[14:11:42] <javascripter> I hate jQuery, it is poor software, badly designed, slow and bugy
[14:11:53] <javascripter> naaaaaaaaah
[14:11:54] <jrockjiggz> its not software
[14:12:02] <jrockjiggz> its a library, and its optional to use
[14:12:05] <javascripter> what is it then
[14:12:15] <NoiseEee> javascripter: o.k.
[14:12:18] <javascripter> software != library ?
[14:12:31] <jrockjiggz> true
[14:13:10] <javascripter> don;t be so strict
[14:14:35] <jrockjiggz> thats the beuty of jQuery, it was written because js was very inconsistant across browsers, and it made a hell of a lot of tasks very easy
[14:14:41] <someprimetime> you hate jquery in a jquery channelâ€¦ right
[14:15:13] <jrockjiggz> jQuery fills a need, and if you feel its not filling your needs, write your own library to address the issues you are facing
[14:15:32] <jrockjiggz> and then share ;)
[14:15:49] <scriptraptor> anyone know any good lightbox/popup type scripts?
[14:16:20] <javascripter> whats the issue? if navigator == ie {do something}, if not, {do otherwise}
[14:17:28] <scriptraptor> i'm after a decent lightbox style confirmation box script if anyone can help point me toward one
[14:18:32] <systemfault> scriptraptor: The best one I've used is not free :/ fancybox2
[14:18:52] <scriptraptor> needs to be free
[14:18:54] <scriptraptor> :/
[14:20:36] <breakingthings> javascripter: lol 10/10 troll wud laff agen.
[14:22:10] <relipse> how do i do this in jquery, it gives me error: input[name=household_members[0][name]]
[14:22:44] <NoiseEee> $('input[name="household_members[0][name]"]')
[14:23:34] <relipse> oh thanks
[14:25:54] <Mottie> I think you mean $('input[name="' + household_members[0][name] + '"]')
[14:26:26] <ronson> Has anyone struggled with JS calculations for height being ran before a CSS animation completes (and thus gets incorrect heights) before?  I can't figure out how to fix it
[14:26:27] <NoiseEee> i'm assuming actually he has an input with the name "household_members[0][name]
[14:26:42] <oliwe> ive got a issue with jquery, im using draggable on a div and it uses absolute positioning rather than relative, i need to know where it is within its constrained box but since the constrained box moves i dont know where it is
[14:27:27] <Mottie> ronson: it's a known bug in 1.9.0 (http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13183)
[14:27:57] <relipse> how do i set a value to an input with the edit mask plugin (http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/)
[14:29:03] <ronson> I'm using 1.8.2, but it seems like that is affected as well
[14:29:12] <ronson> I'll put it aside for the time being
[14:29:20] <ronson> thanks
[14:29:29] <Mottie> do you have a demo?
[14:29:40] <ronson> I'll make one.
[14:37:40] <svcghost_> Is there a way to check the file type uploaded via a file input in a form
[14:37:55] <svcghost_> And if so, is there any way to do it without only checking the file extension?
[14:39:08] <coldhead> svcghost_: you can use the File API to detect the mimetype http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/
[14:39:51] <svcghost_> is that HTML 5 only?
[14:40:04] <relipse>  how do i set a value to an input with the edit mask plugin (http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/)
[14:40:18] <coldhead> yes svcghost_, it doesn't work everywhere
[14:40:35] <coldhead> but without File API you have virtually no access to anything pertaining to a file input
[14:40:45] <coldhead> less you want to use flash or java or something
[14:41:04] <svcghost_> thank you
[14:41:06] <svcghost_> appreciate it
[14:41:19] <Mottie> svcghost_: if you can't use html5... try this: http://pixelgraphics.us/downloadify/test.html
[14:41:36] <someprimetime> ugh html5 uploading
[14:41:39] <svcghost_> sweet thank you
[14:45:46] <tolborg> How do I traverse twice up the DOM with closest if both steps has the same class? $(this).closest('.views-row').closest('views-row') does not seem to work :(
[14:46:44] <Mottie> are they both the same element?
[14:46:49] <tolborg> nope
[14:46:50] <relipse> how do i set a value to an input with the edit mask plugin (http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/)
[14:47:01] <coldhead> maybe .parents('.view-row:nth(1)')
[14:47:02] <tolborg> the 'first' closest is a child of the next
[14:47:23] <Mottie> maybe try something like $(this).closest('div.views-row').closest('article.views-row')
[14:47:33] <Mottie> whatever the element is
[14:47:48] <tolborg> Mottie: ahhh.. then I misunderstood your question.. they are both divs
[14:47:57] <tolborg> coldhead: that properly works.. thanks!
[14:48:01] <tolborg> probably
[14:48:25] <Mottie> which one are you targetting?
[14:48:38] <jrockjiggz> I was going to suggest $(this).closest('.views-row').eq(1)
[14:48:58] <xdjuj_> Hi
[14:49:00] <Mottie> or $(this).closest('.views-row').parent('.views-row')
[14:49:00] <coldhead> i wouldn't expect closest() to match multiple elements
[14:49:09] <xdjuj_> What is actually the best jQuery masonry plugin ?
[14:49:19] <Mottie> or $(this).prevAll('.views-row:first')
[14:49:37] <tolborg> I want to target the grandparent
[14:49:41] <Mottie> I mean $(this).parents('.views-row:first')
[14:49:43] <tolborg> and then traverse back down
[14:50:12] <ronson> Mottie: It's actually too complex to reduce to a jsfiddle, I've been trying for 10minutes.  It involves triggering a custom event on a click to remove padding on an element on a page which animates in CSS and then does a height calculation to fix the layout... wow that's gross to write.
[14:50:45] <tolborg> coldhead: your solution with .parents('.view-row:nth(1)') worked!
[14:50:47] <tolborg> thanks!
[14:51:14] <coldhead> oh good, have fun with that
[14:51:19] <tolborg> :)
[14:51:39] <mads-> I was in here asking about this. But I'm still not entirely sure. What is the advantage of attaching a function to the jquery object? Like $.mynewfunction = function() {...}
[14:52:03] <ronson> you mean $.fn.myPlugin = function() {
[14:52:09] <systemfault> If it's not a plugin... none
[14:52:09] <rmill> breakingthings: yes it does.
[14:52:17] <breakingthings> what.
[14:52:26] <rmill> _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', name, value]);
[14:52:33] <breakingthings> rmill: what does what.
[14:52:55] <rmill> you were saying _gaq.push doesn't work.
[14:53:02] <mads-> ronson, no, I mean $.mynewfunction()
[14:53:07] <breakingthings> rmill: No I didn't.
[14:53:16] <breakingthings> I said _gaq.push(function(){}); wouldn't.
[14:53:36] <jrockjiggz> coldhead: you are right, closest returns a single index
[14:53:54] <rmill> breakingthings: It should. That's how you would set a callback
[14:54:00] <breakingthings> _gaq.push(function(){}); executes the function as a callback when previous _gaq.push events are completed, but won't work for temporarily delaying the submission
[14:54:09] <breakingthings> regardless, I found a better way around it altogether.
[14:54:15] <rmill> OK.
[14:54:19] <Mottie> xdjuj_: check this out... http://www.code-pal.com/css3-based-masonry-layout-with-jquery-masonry-as-fallback/
[14:55:14] <breakingthings> but the problem, rmill, was that _gaq.push() (as far as I could tell) only returns 0, which means you can't do what I was saying with return _gaq.push(function(){return true;});
[14:55:40] <breakingthings> I'm still not sure how I would solve it if I was still trying to do it that way, luckily I realized that there's a better way to test against it
[14:55:52] <breakingthings> completely disregarding the form submission event.
[14:55:58] <coldhead> mads-: http://jsfiddle.net/RTerF/
[14:57:21] <Blaster> hey what's that functioon that lets you pass $(this) into a closure?
[14:59:39] <coldhead> Blaster: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call?
[15:00:01] <coldhead> or apply
[15:08:17] <motaka2> can anyone explain this code to me?  http://pastebin.com/VuLgfBcf
[15:09:48] * coldhead shudders
[15:09:53] <mads-> coldhead, thanks :) neat and tidy :)
[15:12:07] <coldhead> mads-: ben alman uses that technique for a lot of his plugins. check the note to non-jQuery users http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/
[15:12:11] <someprimetime> it's looping through a bunch of objects passed in as the parameter and either uses them or creates them if they don't exist?
[15:15:18] <motaka2> someprimetime: thx
[15:15:51] <idletask> Hello
[15:16:20] <someprimetime> sure.. although that's just at first glance i'd need to look at more code to get a better understanding of it
[15:16:29] <someprimetime> non descriptive variable names ftl though
[15:16:38] <idletask> I have searched on Google for positioning the cursor in a text area using jQuery and all answers I have found had to create an external function, but none were using version 1.9.0
[15:16:43] <coldhead> good job security
[15:16:50] <idletask> Does 1.9.0 have a builtin function for this?
[15:17:18] <someprimetime> you can't position a cursor in a textfield without control of the user's OS so you'd need to use some kind of java application or some crap
[15:17:34] <someprimetime> the actual mouse cursor, right?
[15:17:46] <idletask> someprimetime: no, I mean the caret
[15:17:48] <idletask> Sorry
[15:18:02] <someprimetime> wait what caret?
[15:18:06] <idletask> In the text area
[15:18:11] <someprimetime> the blinking cursor?
[15:18:15] <idletask> Yes
[15:18:16] <ronson> .focus
[15:18:16] <someprimetime> ah my mistake
[15:18:23] <someprimetime> ronson++
[15:18:37] <someprimetime> native js event
[15:18:52] <idletask> OK, I haven't explained myself very well
[15:18:55] <jrockjiggz> http://snipplr.com/view/5144/getset-cursor-in-html-textarea/
[15:18:56] <someprimetime> rather in your case you'd probably be doing $('#textarea').focus();
[15:19:00] <idletask> I mean to position it _at a certain offset_
[15:19:06] <idletask> I know about .focus()
[15:19:23] <someprimetime> where do you want it?
[15:19:23] <jrockjiggz> Sel.text.length;
[15:19:49] <idletask> I want it at an offset given as an argument
[15:20:26] <idletask> I have found examples, but old enough that I wondered whether 1.9.0 already had a function for that
[15:20:34] <someprimetime> do you want to simply place it at the end of the text that's already in there? if so you need to clear the text area (save the previous text into a variable) and then focus it and repopulate with the new text
[15:20:46] <someprimetime> $newTextarea.hide().fadeIn(100).val('').focus().val(comment);
[15:20:49] <someprimetime> something like that
[15:20:59] <someprimetime> if i understand your problem correctly.
[15:21:56] <idletask> The text area contains what is supposed to be JSON, I send that to the server, Jackson parses it, and if it fails, it gives me the line number and column number (which I display) and the offset in the character array (which I want to position where appropriate)
[15:23:37] <idletask> I see that there is the choice between createTextRange() and setSelectionRange() according to the browser you use, I just wondered whether jQuery already had that logic inside itself instead of resorting to writing that function myself
[15:24:51] <idletask> (and I certainly wouldn't be the last one to do that, given the number of questions asked about that very subject on Stack Overflow alone
[15:25:54] <coldhead> 1.9 hasn't added a caret positioning fn :(
[15:26:02] <coldhead> that's plugin territory
[15:27:30] <someprimetime> idletask: write the plugin yourself and then open source it :)
[15:28:01] <idletask> someprimetime: might as well submit a patch to jQuery, but I have only done JavaScript for 4 days
[15:28:21] <coldhead> definitely plugin territory
[15:28:32] <coldhead> jquery is trying to get smaller
[15:28:35] <someprimetime> idletask: AFAIK this isn't something that would ever get put into jquery core
[15:28:58] <idletask> OK, I'll look for plugins then
[15:33:24] <idletask> http://code.google.com/p/jcaret/ <-- here is one, it seems, I'll try it out
[15:40:52] <sukima> I know this question gets asked all the time but what MVC frameworks are compatible with jQuery-mobile? and of them any advice on how to go about marrying the two frameworks? jqm on it's own is great but the logic behind a mobile app needs some kind of MVC framework.

[16:01:09] <coldhead> loladdy
[16:06:34] <cusco> hi
[16:06:35] <someprimetime> curious why the loladdy
[16:06:48] <someprimetime> for or against him?
[16:07:11] <coldhead> nothing like that
[16:07:21] <coldhead> i'm just quietly amused that the's the JS MVC guy
[16:07:34] <coldhead> and that there is such a thing
[16:07:39] <coldhead> a THE js mvc guy
[16:08:38] <tw2113> coldhead, you can't be thinking about other js stuff yet, you haven't gotten familiar with jquery
[16:09:04] <opie-x> should the topic not say jquery ui 1.10.0?
[16:10:16] <coldhead> too true tw2113 but i am taking notes for the future
[16:10:29] <someprimetime> coldhead: haha true
[16:10:54] <someprimetime> yeoman is interesting
[16:11:13] <idletask> TypeError: $.browser is undefined (from this caret plugin)
[16:11:23] <idletask> Anyone knows how to fix that?
[16:15:42] <nodestool> what is the beautiful way to get the parent <tr>, like i have a <tr><td>..</td><td><form><button type="submit"></form></td></tr> and i am trying to get the tr that contains the form
[16:16:53] <gf3> nodestool: $(this).closest('tr').find('form')
[16:17:34] <motaka2> I cant get the value of a textarea using val()  - wahts the problem ?
[16:20:11] <nodestool> gf3: almost $(this).closest('tr');, thank you :)
[16:20:36] <nodestool> motaka2: i think you may have to use .html()
[16:21:14] <Quest> so if i want a page to be dynamically changed in realtime. data attribes and ajax is my best bet ? like a chat web page its realtime. and updating with a db at backend
[16:21:27] <motaka2> nodestool: no doesnt work
[16:40:17] <idletask> OK, I have found my function. Now, next step, I'll need to add a onclick event on a link programatically, I suppose jQuery can do that? :p
[16:40:27] <Whirl3d> anybody know of a jquery script that converts select elements into stylizable simulated select elements?
[16:42:34] <dwarder> i need to find out the index of ui class inside which input type radio is checked http://jsfiddle.net/NsY6w/
[16:42:41] <dwarder> i can't figure out how
[16:45:22] <tfitts> anyone have a free banner slider they would recommend?
[16:47:45] <Whirl3d> dwarder, what are you trying to do?
[16:48:50] <idletask> I have a <span> which has an id, I can select that <span>. Inside this <span> there is an <a>, and I'd like to avoid giving this <a> an id: how do I select it if I have a handle on the <span>?
[16:49:24] <Whirl3d> radio button elements are used when you can only select one option out of a group. They are not supposed to be "toggle" worthy, but rather only deselected when another radio button element in the same group is selected.
[16:49:35] <idletask> Is that .find()?
[16:49:52] <Whirl3d> yes
[16:50:27] <dwarder> Whirl3d: there are 3 elements with ui class on the page (in jsfiddle) inside each ui class element there is a radio button, each ui element from to to bottom has an index( 0 for the 1st ui class element, 1 for the second one etc) i need to find out index of ui element inside which the radio button is checked
[16:50:30] <Whirl3d> or $("span a") would find all anchor elements inside span elements
[16:50:54] <dwarder> Whirl3d: .... wait, i just need to know the selected radio button index
[16:51:07] <dwarder> Whirl3d: i need a number from 0 to 2 in my case
[16:51:19] <idletask> Whirl3d: thanks
[16:51:27] <motaka2> I cant get the current value of a textarea using val() - wahts the problem ?
[16:52:00] <idletask> It is so frustrating having to ask newbie questions :/ But it is even more frustrating to TIAS and you never S what you want...
[16:52:18] <thujone> you could try .text() instead of .val()
[16:52:34] <motaka2> thujone: the same result
[16:52:47] <dwarder> Whirl3d: so i just need to know how do i find out index of selected radio button http://jsfiddle.net/CF6v9/
[16:53:04] <thujone> can you post on jsfiddle
[16:53:38] <motaka2> thujone: no, but it is the problem of many people
[16:54:35] <thujone> the question is too vague to answer intelligently
[16:54:36] <dwarder> Whirl3d: that is what i have so far http://jsfiddle.net/49jvE/
[16:55:20] <thujone> i've often used .val() with textareas without a problem
[16:56:45] <dwarder> How do i find out the index of currently selected input radio http://jsfiddle.net/mCbw3/
[16:58:05] <thujone> motaka2: i don't think .val() is buggy if that's what you mean
[16:58:07] <motaka2> thujone: you have used them when your code is like <textarea>your tesxt</textarea>
[16:58:21] <thujone> yes
[16:58:31] <motaka2> thujone:  I want it;s curent value
[16:58:44] <idletask> What is the difference between .val() and .text()? For instance, why use .val() on a textarea and not .text()?
[16:59:15] <thujone> i think you should probably use .val(), but i would read about it in the documentation
[16:59:25] <thujone> i think either would work fine in the example above
[16:59:33] <motaka2> thujone: that means I have a button - when I click the button I want what the user has written
[17:00:31] <thujone> if you posted code, i could help you fix it
[17:00:58] <thujone> there are many reasons why it might be working for you
[17:01:04] <thujone> might *not be
[17:02:34] <dwarder> tried to use filter ... http://jsfiddle.net/bF8Wu/
[17:02:41] <Whirl3d> dwarder, http://jsfiddle.net/49jvE/4/
[17:03:27] <dwarder> Whirl3d: i need an actual number index starting from 0
[17:03:47] <Whirl3d> then set your value=0 for the first one
[17:03:48] <Whirl3d> lol
[17:04:06] <Whirl3d> just change val to index()
[17:04:12] <dwarder> Whirl3d: non relating to what is near with radio
[17:05:01] <dwarder> Whirl3d: oh, great, thank you
[17:06:21] <idletask> OK, if you want to add text inside a <a>, is that .text() or .val()?
[17:08:22] <MikeyD> are any of you familiar with imagemapster?
[17:08:38] <idletask> Self answer: .text()
[17:12:29] <Whirl3d> dwarder, I couldn't get index to work, I'm a lot more rusty than I thought. Here is a bloated, way to much work version that accomplishes the task: http://jsfiddle.net/49jvE/12/   Hopefully someone will know a better way.
[17:13:52] <Whirl3d> Just ignore me. I had a typo--use the original fiddle with index.
[17:18:25] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: my example: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/49jvE/15/
[17:19:35] <Whirl3d> someprimetime, this works: http://jsfiddle.net/49jvE/16/
[17:19:42] <dwarder> damn i just found out that i need an index of ui element 'cause inside that element could be more that one radio
[17:20:00] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: succint. +1
[17:20:20] <dwarder> so the first time i asked ... was what i wanted .
[17:21:15] <dwarder> Whirl3d: will try to modify your last version to my needs
[17:21:23] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/49jvE/18/
[17:22:17] <someprimetime> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/49jvE/19/
[17:22:17] <dwarder> Whirl3d: dude you are awesome :)
[17:22:24] <idletask> OK, I have a handle on my <a>, how to I add an "onclick" to it, like when you write <a onclick="foo();">?
[17:22:34] <MikeyD> would any of you be willing to look at a link i pm and help me figure out why the javascript copied from http://jsfiddle.net/jamietre/Fdk6u/ isnt working?
[17:22:35] <someprimetime> starting from 1 instead of 0 :x
[17:22:47] <someprimetime> disregard that emoticon that's not what i watned
[17:24:13] <Whirl3d> idletask, it is best to use .on to handle your click events in this case.  $("span a").on(''click", function (e) {e.preventDefault(); do stuff() });
[17:25:01] <idletask> Aah, that .preventDefault() thing again
[17:25:16] <Whirl3d> the e.preventDefault() part keeps the anchor elements action from firing. So if you have a url or target id, it won't automatically to there
[17:25:16] <idletask> Is that what you use in order to avoid to have to specify href="#"?
[17:25:35] <Whirl3d> No, that just stops if from going to wherever href=
[17:25:52] <Whirl3d> it literally prevents the default behavior.
[17:25:52] <idletask> Whirl3d: excellent!
[17:26:20] <idletask> Thank you for the information
[17:26:59] <Whirl3d> np
[17:27:11] <Whirl3d> MikeyD what problems are you having?
[17:27:33] <idletask> So, it also means the function must always have an argument, then?
[17:28:06] <Whirl3d> the function always takes a jquery event object
[17:28:08] <Whirl3d> e
[17:28:35] <idletask> That is, if you use .on()?
[17:28:42] <Whirl3d> you can ignore it if you aren't going to use it, but in the case of anchor elements, you need the event object to prevent the behavior.
[17:28:49] <Whirl3d> same with .click()
[17:29:11] <Whirl3d> or "mousedown"  ?   maybe it's mouseup()   not sure
[17:30:10] <Whirl3d> The click event, no matter how you get it, is going to pass the click event object to whatever handler function you assign to it.
[17:30:43] <MikeyD> Whirl3d: can i pm you the link ?
[17:31:09] <Whirl3d> sure, but I don't have a  lot of time. If I can't get it right away, I may not be able to help..
[17:31:20] <idletask> Whirl3d: but what if you use <a onclick="foo();">?
[17:31:36] <Whirl3d> you will get Boo'd out of this channel, for one.
[17:31:38] <Whirl3d> lol
[17:31:52] <MikeyD> the console says: Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Window] is not a function â€” but i copied the code directly from the jsfiddle and that page doesnt have the error. so i dont know what i did
[17:32:09] <Whirl3d> it's bad form and it foo will still ge the event object, I believe
[17:32:09] <idletask> Well, I use it for one link which always does the same thing
[17:32:28] <Whirl3d> MikeyD, you haven't loaded Jquery or Mapster at that point
[17:32:49] <idletask> So, you are saying that the best practice is to alter the <a> when the page is loaded?
[17:32:56] <Whirl3d> make sure you include the jquery library and the mapster library before you run your script.
[17:33:18] <MikeyD> i have links to the scripts in the headerâ€¦ line 53-56
[17:33:29] <Whirl3d> and run your script in a $(document).ready(function () { })) wrapper, mikeyD
[17:34:53] <Whirl3d> MikeyD, what's happening is that your becomeamember.js code is running immediately (before the rest of the DOM is loaded)
[17:35:31] <Whirl3d> so if you wrap the entire code in: $(document).ready(function () {   start your code here  });   it will likely work.
[17:36:03] <MikeyD> ok, just wrapped the code. same error is coming up in console. dang
[17:37:51] <Whirl3d> I don't see wher eyou load jquery?
[17:38:44] <Whirl3d> wait. You need to run a WP command to include jquery, I think.
[17:38:45] <MikeyD> it should be on line 35: <script type='text/javascript' src='/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.8.3'></script>
[17:39:20] <Whirl3d> Try replacing $ in your fiddle with JQuery
[17:40:01] <Whirl3d> Notice you have Woo Slider Setup using JQuery(stuff) rather than $(stuff). It's most likely because $ is being used by some other framework or something.
[17:42:01] <MikeyD> Whirl3d: i don't understand where i am replacing th $ with jquery. do you mean on line3 of becomeamember.js?
[17:42:02] <idletask> OK, my function does not work, the caret does not get positioned in the text area :(
[17:42:08] <Whirl3d> sorry, idletask. I am not sure why, but yes, it is considered best practice to select the element and apply methods to it separate from the markup.
[17:42:48] <idletask> OK, I'll do that then
[17:43:25] <Whirl3d> MikeyD, pretend that you never saw jquery use the shortcut $    so instead of var item=$('.itemclass'); you will write var item=JQuery('.itemclass');
[17:44:08] <Whirl3d> idletask, if you are trying to work with the position of the caret in a textarea element, it's not easy..
[17:44:27] <idletask> Well, I have a function for that, which works (I forgot to .focus() before I did that)
[17:44:42] <Whirl3d> which plugin are you using?
[17:44:47] <mads-> with $("div .foo") I can select all divs of class foo. Does it have to specified in a certain way or will I get the same from $(".foo div")?
[17:44:48] <idletask> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/499126/jquery-set-cursor-position-in-text-area
[17:44:53] <MikeyD> Whirl3d: aha! the error went away and the image disappeared, but that helped a lot, thank you. going to see if i can figure the disappearing image out on my own first
[17:45:04] <idletask> Whirl3d: none, there was one, but it didn't work for me (it was called jCaret)
[17:45:13] <idletask> Dating back 2010, maybe that's why
[17:46:04] <Whirl3d> mads- the difference between "div .foo" and ".foo div" is huge. One says, select all .foo elements inside of div elements. the other says select all div elements inside of .foo elements.
[17:46:39] <Whirl3d> MikeyD, no problem. You'll get it.
[17:47:06] <mads-> Whirl3d, thank you. Seemed like I missed an important concept :)
[17:48:18] <Whirl3d> mads- you may have been confusing the other nomenclature which is $(".foo", "div") I believe  which is like the first option (all the .foo elements inside a div element.
[17:49:06] <mads-> Whirl3d, I might have. Well, back to reading then ;)
[17:49:41] <Whirl3d> but listen here. If you want all divs of class foo it's easy:   div.foo    (no space)
[17:50:22] <idletask> Argh
[17:50:29] <idletask> Var scope in JavaScript sucks balls
[17:50:53] <Whirl3d> the space indicates a drop in heirarchy...   div .foo (with the space) says select all divs then look at their decendants for .foo elements  with no space, it's all divs with .foo class
[17:51:23] <idletask> Wrecking balls
[17:51:29] <Whirl3d> idletask, what are you trying to do?
[17:52:24] <idletask> Whirl3d: var a; if (c1) { a=; } if (c2) { a=; } -- if c1 and c2 are true, a in the second if has not changed values
[17:52:43] <idletask> I understand now why there are all these function(){}() all around
[17:54:03] <Whirl3d> say that first line again
[17:54:46] <idletask> I mean, when getting out of c2, if c1 was true, variable a will have the value set in c1
[17:55:18] <Whirl3d> if (c1) {a="apple"); if (c2){a='pear'}, if (c1 && c2) {a='orange'}   can be written: var a=c1&&c2?"orange":c1?"apple":c2?"pear":"none";
[17:56:03] <idletask> Yeah well, that was an illustration, the actual code is more complicated than that
[17:56:22] <idletask> (and I don't like chained ternary boolean expressions :p)
[17:56:30] <Whirl3d> You still haven't explained what you are trying to do
[17:56:40] <coldhead> idletask++
[17:57:06] <Whirl3d> Agreed, I was just responding to your whining about all the function () {} mess
[17:57:29] <idletask> Whirl3d: nevermind, I have found an alternative
[17:57:46] <coldhead> great work everyone
[17:58:18] <idletask> (the function above to set the cursor position works beautifully by the way)
[17:58:24] <Whirl3d> Next time, you will save yourself a headache (and the people helping you) if you just create a jsfiddle with an example of the problem and post the link here.
[18:01:09] <BryanRuiz> can i change the padding of hidden elements?
[18:01:54] <Whirl3d> isn't that a #css question? I would say yes, but I am not very good at css
[18:02:39] <shoky> BryanRuiz: sure..
[18:02:50] <shoky> you won't see it, of course..
[18:03:23] <Whirl3d> shoky! coldhead! what's up guys? Just in time for me to leave. awww I miss y'all.
[18:03:34] <BryanRuiz> shoky: allright then it must be a bug in my code, ill keep looking.. thx
[18:03:48] <coldhead> i'll always cherish the time we spent together Whirl3d
[18:03:56] <someprimetime> yeah it's always a good time when the boys are back in town
[18:03:57] <coldhead> like a woman's love

[18:05:35] <someprimetime> aol:go chat?room=zerver
[18:05:51] <someprimetime> whatever happened to all the old aol/aim hackers?
[18:05:54] <someprimetime> Hypah: is one of them
[18:05:57] <someprimetime> where did the rest go?

[18:07:12] <someprimetime> so leet
[18:07:38] <someprimetime> i still have that screen name he gave me <3
[18:15:58] <herdrick> How do you get the dynamic functionality of live() from on()  ?
[18:16:45] <coldhead> $(document).on('click', 'some_selector', function () {...})
[18:16:56] <coldhead> don't actually use document but that's what live() did
[18:17:30] <someprimetime> live calls jquery.Event // jQuery.Event is based on DOM3 Events as specified by the ECMAScript Language Binding
[18:17:30] <coldhead> BinaryKitten will eat you if you use document
[18:18:06] <herdrick> coldhead: that isn't 'living' however.   I tried that, (minus the selector arg) but found that target elements defined after that JS ran did not get the function added to their 'click' hook
[18:18:26] <herdrick> i.e. it doesn't do the live part of 'live'
[18:18:27] <coldhead> that really should work
[18:18:45] <herdrick> coldhead:  huh.  then i am probably mistaken
[18:18:51] <herdrick> bbiab
[18:19:36] <coldhead> here for example it works http://jsfiddle.net/X8HH2/
[18:19:40] <coldhead> apologies to BK
[18:20:05] <BryanRuiz> what is this line saying?  jQuery( "#body_section" ).after( jQuery( "#image_gallery" ).detach() );
[18:21:35] <BryanRuiz> is it unattaching and reattaching the #image_gallery?
[18:21:47] <coldhead> it's not reattaching
[18:21:50] <someprimetime> no
[18:21:53] <coldhead> i can't imagine why you would do that
[18:21:57] <someprimetime> that's retarded
[18:22:12] <someprimetime> and if it was detaching, it'd be doing it after it's been appended e.g. after after()
[18:22:23] <someprimetime> but that's lame because after is for inserting content
[18:22:47] <BryanRuiz> i think its some hacky way of reordering the dom
[18:22:57] <matthewgonzalez> looks like it's inserting #image-gallery into #body-section and then removing the DOM element
[18:23:20] <BryanRuiz> doesnt detach return the removed elements?
[18:24:36] <Whirl3d> it's appending the new content to the unattached element
[18:24:48] <matthewgonzalez> oh i seeâ€¦ was confused by the order of op
[18:24:59] <coldhead> it is very poorly written
[18:25:47] <BryanRuiz> thats why i cant apply .css() rules to it.. its not in the dom
[18:26:40] <Whirl3d> You can apply css rules to unattached elements, I believe.
[18:27:15] <coldhead> .css() works, but rules in your stylesheet won't apply
[18:27:15] <b-ot> coldhead, @Apply: Tjajdw
[18:27:17] <herdrick> coldhead: ok, that works fine for me too.  i think the issue is that I was putting bits of JS in <script> tags in my html file
[18:27:22] <coldhead> thanks b-ot
[18:28:19] <matthewgonzalez> is the 'detach' necessary?
[18:28:27] <herdrick> and the order of those tags mattered - that is, whether they came before or after the definition of the HTML elements they were meant to attach to
[18:28:35] <herdrick> coldhead: so, thanks
[18:29:38] <coldhead> ah, good debuggin
[18:29:42] <herdrick> coldhead: for example, take a look at the FiddleJS now
[18:30:06] <herdrick> with the JS in <script> tags, the .live() is live, but the .on() is not
[18:30:28] <BryanRuiz> matthewgonzalez: probably could be hidden instead rather then detached, but im not going to mess with it
[18:30:38] <coldhead> you don't appear to have re-saved the fiddle herdrick
[18:30:50] <matthewgonzalez> i mean couldn't you just do  jQuery( "#body_section" ).after( jQuery( "#image_gallery" ));
[18:31:16] <herdrick> colhead: is that 'update'?   this is my first time fiddlin'
[18:31:30] <coldhead> ya that worked
[18:31:44] <coldhead> the thing is, you are using the simpler signature for on()
[18:31:49] <coldhead> which acts like bind()
[18:32:05] <coldhead> you need the slightly more gomblicated one for live()
[18:32:12] <herdrick> if you use the same signature in the JS 'file' it works
[18:32:26] <herdrick> i'll show you
[18:32:33] <BryanRuiz> matthewgonzalez: hmph, yeah that worked..
[18:32:35] <coldhead> $('selecor').on('event') vs $(parent_to_bind_to).on('click', selector)
[18:33:09] <herdrick> updated.  same signature, but now it works
[18:35:18] <coldhead> but compare http://jsfiddle.net/X8HH2/3/
[18:35:35] <coldhead> the trickier signature works with stuff that is added to the page AFTER you bind the event
[18:35:46] <coldhead> the simpler signature only works for stuff ALREADY in the page when the code runs
[18:38:33] <edkwh> Hi guys, anybody around to answer a quick question? :)
[18:38:40] <tw2113> just us bots
[18:39:41] <edkwh> Hope you bots can answer :p
[18:39:50] <coldhead> we're still waiting for the question
[18:39:55] <coldhead> THIS ISN'T AS QUICK AS ADVERTISED
[18:40:09] <coldhead> WHY WAS I PROGRAMMED TO FEEL IMPATIENCE etc
[18:40:50] * tw2113 puts coldhead on infinite loop
[18:41:35] <edkwh> Haha, okay okay, if I write a widget that would embedded on a publisher's site with a form on it, can the publisher hook into the form with their own submit handler and capture the results of the form?
[18:42:06] <coldhead> yes
[18:42:19] <coldhead> unless it's in an iframe
[18:43:00] <edkwh> yeah was thinking the only way is to use an iframe, but iframes are.. well iframes
[18:43:16] <coldhead> right
[18:43:17] <edkwh> no way to prevent that thru code?
[18:43:47] <coldhead> not reliably
[18:43:48] <herdrick> coldhead: oh, ok.  i see.  thank you!    that is in the official docs, but I read blog posts like these: http://www.jquery4u.com/jquery-functions/on-vs-live-review/  which aren't too clear about the difference there.
[18:43:53] <herdrick> coldhead: thanks again!
[18:44:04] <coldhead> you can detach their form handlers but they can put them back
[18:44:09] <coldhead> or they could bind to a parent element
[18:44:28] <coldhead> have fun herdrick
[18:47:25] <jrockjiggz> Hi, <select><option data-attr="help"></select> $('select').on('change', function(){ $(this).data('attr') }); cannot work?
[18:47:25] <edkwh> yeah makes sense
[18:48:49] <edkwh> coldhead: they can change the whole form anyway, and stop submitting the form to us and just to them too yes? Guess I'll have to go with the iframe then :/
[18:49:24] <Dreamer3>     @year = $(@item.find("select")[2])
[18:49:28] <Dreamer3> is there an easier way to do this
[18:49:54] <jrockjiggz> thats pretty easy no?
[18:50:16] <jrockjiggz> @year = $('select',@item)[2]
[18:50:38] <Dreamer3> @year = @item.find("select:nth-child(3)")
[18:50:41] <Dreamer3> there we go
[18:50:59] <jrockjiggz> @year = $('select',@item).eq(3)
[18:51:09] <Dreamer3> *looks up eq*
[18:51:13] <jrockjiggz> ?eq
[18:51:16] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[18:51:38] <jrockjiggz> eq(2) gives jquery object, where [2] gives native js object
[18:52:50] <coldhead> edkwh: the difficult parent pages have in accessing iframes is why you DO want them in this case :)
[18:52:57] <MikeyD> someone is offering to sell me "3000 javascript" which will improve the effectiveness of my website. i think i should do it. sounds like a lot of improvement.
[18:53:24] <tw2113> sounds like a good deal mik
[18:53:27] <tw2113> MikeyD
[18:56:25] <edkwh> coldhead: yeah definitely, cause it is sensitive data and they might use it against us. anyway, with iframe i won't have to deal with parent CSS, JS conflicts, etc etc etc *consoling self*
[18:56:39] <edkwh> coldhead: Thanks for your input :)
[19:23:49] <Dreamer3> jrockjiggz: thanks

[19:51:34] <Lemon|mbp> dont need support for textures are all those other fancy features
[19:59:12] <coldhead> please kill me
[19:59:20] <coldhead> woah woah ohhh please kill me
[19:59:23] <coldhead> sorry wrong window
[20:02:56] <BinaryKitten> coldhead you really need to stop making me out to be the evil boogie monster
[20:03:14] <BinaryKitten> please?
[20:04:34] <coldhead> i never said you killed anyone
[20:04:40] <coldhead> only that you had strong views on delegation
[20:04:48] <coldhead> strong, white supremacist views
[20:05:01] <coldhead> but i'll try to stop mentioning you, BK
[20:05:15] <coldhead> i'll threaten people with someone scarier
[20:05:29] <coldhead> nominations welcome
[20:05:53] <coldhead> (i mean some people would be happy just to be thought of mentioned while they slept, sheesh)
[20:06:15] <coldhead> (this is why this country is going down the drain honestly, young people today, need another war)
[20:08:20] <BinaryKitten> coldhead wasn't asleep was playing a Game after doing server upgrades for work
[20:08:35] <BinaryKitten> suppose i best go try to get some of this sleep thing though..
[20:08:55] <coldhead> it's recommended
[20:09:02] <coldhead> good luck!
[20:10:52] <relipse> great input mask plugin: https://github.com/RobinHerbots/jquery.inputmask
[20:11:26] <relipse> thanks!
[20:42:12] <idletask> When it comes to "rich popups" which are not windows, is jQuery UI the plugin of choice, or are there less "rich" plugins?
[20:46:04] <Whirl3d> i nominate bswiggins as official jquery boogie monster if nominations are still open. Just dont tell him. LOL
[20:46:47] <MikeyD> Whirl3d: hey, i finally got the imagemapster working! had to use //<![CDATA[
[20:46:47] <MikeyD> $(window).load(function(){ and an iframe with the <script's> or wordpress was throwing hissy fits
[20:47:47] <Whirl3d> really? Well congrats on getting it work, but boo on WP I dread integrating the two for my upcoming project
[20:48:26] <coldhead> idletask: there are lots of others -- i used boxxy for a long time but it's probably not maintained anymore
[20:49:10] <coldhead> http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/boxy/
[20:49:14] <MikeyD> I need someone to do some work for me, just 1 part, so I have an example, because I have no idea what I'm doing. If I have an example I can figure it out from there
[20:49:15] <idletask> coldhead: maybe you can guide me, I don't want anything complicated, just an onhover hook which shows a nicer popup than the default one -- this popup would contain text only
[20:50:17] <idletask> I have vaguely read somewhere that these popups could be styled using CSS and made visible using simple JavaScript hooks
[20:50:18] <coldhead> http://code.drewwilson.com/entry/tiptip-jquery-plugin ?
[20:51:13] <rootcoma> How can I detect a change in div height, like after a image loads?
[20:51:18] <coldhead> there's also http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/demos/ if you're a fan of the abstract
[20:51:35] <MikeyD> I am attempting to combine this ( http://jsfiddle.net/juvyh/1116/ ) but when you click on a state, text for that corresponding state appears like in this one, where mousing over on a head brings up text ( http://jsfiddle.net/nYkAG/562/ ) - except on the map i want it on clicking, and to stay until a different state is clicked.
[20:51:53] <coldhead> rootcoma: you could bind an event handler to run when the image loads, and resize the parent at that point
[20:52:06] <idletask> coldhead: both look quite promising, thanks a lot for the links!
[20:52:22] <coldhead> rootcoma: or you can catch an arbitrary resize with this plugin http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[20:53:25] <coldhead> ugh open graph
[20:54:17] <rootcoma> coldhead: thanks.
[20:54:45] <coldhead> YOU ARE WELCOME
[20:55:15] <rootcoma> 0_0
[21:09:02] <trinadh> MikeyD: http://jsfiddle.net/juvyh/1118/
[21:09:52] <mmlac> Does anyone know why my $("#foo").width() suddenly is 1200px after a resize and when I call it manually afterwards it is 190px?   #foo is a ul
[21:09:58] <MikeyD> trinadh: whoa. im a moron
[21:10:04] <MikeyD> thank you so much
[21:10:11] <trinadh> welcome :)
[21:10:38] <wolfgang42> mmlac: Can we have a jsfiddle testcase?
[21:11:29] <mmlac> I work on one. But it is literally a resize calles this function and I get insane values...
[21:11:53] <mmlac> I call them myself / even on the element that gave me the result -> sane value
[21:12:36] <wolfgang42> Maybe it's wrong during a resize?
[21:12:50] <mmlac> it should trigger 1500ms after the resize finished
[21:13:04] <mmlac> I'll write up a jsfiddle and see if it occurs there, too
[21:13:22] <phonebook_> hi jquery. does anyone know why http://jsfiddle.net/xSNpM/2/ would work in chrome, ie, and opera but not in safari? its 3 lines of code. basic web sockets. have tried locally, on js fiddle, and on a site
[21:13:54] <phonebook_> 4 lines
[21:15:15] <Cork> phonebook_: you're sure its not WebkitWebsocket in safari?
[21:15:28] <wolfgang42> phonebook_: Which safari?
[21:16:02] <Cork> also i think safari was quite late in adding websocket, so it might not be supported
[21:17:17] <phonebook_> 5.1.7
[21:17:34] <Cork> it was fully supported first in safari 6
[21:17:58] <wolfgang42> phonebook_: see http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets
[21:18:32] <Cork> though 5.0 and 5.1 has support for the old vulnerable 78 protocol
[21:19:06] <phonebook_> hold on. im looking. this could solve a few problems. i thought it auto-updated
[21:19:21] <mmlac> the basic jsfiddle worksâ€¦. ffffffffff. What breaks my width()?  :(
[21:20:09] <coldhead> css?
[21:20:24] <mmlac> CSS does not magically change after 1 second
[21:21:06] <mindis|wurk> 1200px sounds like your window width
[21:21:10] <coldhead> it can, with transitions
[21:21:24] <mmlac> hm, the margin might screw this uo
[21:21:27] <mmlac> up*
[21:21:31] <phonebook_> holy *** - am i reading that right? no more new versions of safari on windows?
[21:21:52] <mmlac> Who willingly uses safari?
[21:21:59] <Cork> good question
[21:21:59] <phonebook_> i love safari
[21:22:00] <mindis|wurk> indeed, nothing of value was lost
[21:22:20] <tw2113> who uses safari on windows, not worried about the mac version
[21:22:20] <mmlac> My safari is my Chrome / Firefox privacy mode
[21:22:30] <mmlac> use, wipe, done
[21:22:35] <phonebook_> that explains like 20 things
[21:22:58] <phonebook_> for example flash doesnt work with transforms in only safari
[21:23:00] <mmlac> I use it on my mac though, still totally useless to me as a developer
[21:23:19] <mindis|wurk> pity the windows safari wasn't even a valid testing bed on how pages are rendered on mac
[21:23:28] <tw2113> to me, Safari on mac is like IE on Windows?a good firefox downloader
[21:23:40] <mmlac> It's way better than IE though
[21:23:50] <phonebook_> this is detremental news to me. it was my favorite browser
[21:23:52] <tw2113> it did do a nicer job
[21:23:57] <mmlac> :)
[21:24:00] <mindis|wurk> no, IE is not a good firefox downloader. last time i installed windows i couldn't get IE to download the firefox installer from the official site
[21:24:10] <mindis|wurk> it kept blocking the download
[21:24:38] <Cork> lol
[21:25:08] <Cork> well you do have the browser choose thingy
[21:25:26] <mindis|wurk> not if you don't run windows update
[21:25:36] <Cork> on new installs
[21:26:09] <mmlac> it seriously was a transition that effe up my width().  Thanks a lot.
[21:26:21] <mindis|wurk> i didn't get it on my w7sp1 since i didn't run the update that adds it
[21:28:14] <coldhead> i am sorry for your loss, phonebook_
[21:28:22] <coldhead> you should air your grievances on social media
[21:28:36] <coldhead> this would never have happened while steve jobs were alive
[21:28:37] <coldhead> etc
[21:28:59] <Cork> lol
[21:29:59] <idletask> OK, it is the second plugin which I encounter which raises this error (qtip): it tries to use $.browser, and I take it it has disappeared from jQuery at some point
[21:30:19] <Cork> idletask: it was removed in jquery 1.9
[21:30:24] <idletask> Knowing that I am using version 1.9.0, how would I rewrite this --> ieAdjust = ($.browser.msie) ? 1 : 0; ?
[21:30:26] <Cork> so it's just been removed
[21:30:41] <mindis|wurk> eeh shorthands
[21:30:48] * mindis|wurk flees in terror
[21:30:50] <Cork> idletask: it should be using feature testing
[21:30:54] <idletask> Not that I care about IE
[21:30:56] <phonebook_> coldhead, its kind of funny. it is a genuine loss
[21:31:03] <phonebook_> im considering buying a mac
[21:31:14] <coldhead> ha! that's probably what they wanted you to do
[21:31:16] <Cork> idletask: though there are a migration plugin that readds browser*
[21:31:42] <Cork> idletask: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/
[21:32:33] <idletask> Cork: OK, I'll have a look at this and also at the pre-2.x versions of qtip
[21:32:46] <idletask> I surmise they have got ridden of this dependency...
[21:33:06] <Cork> might; might not
[21:33:29] <Cork> wouldn't be surprised if they just replaced it with regex on the ua string
[21:34:10] <coldhead> everyone should have gotten rid of that dependency years ago when browser was first deprecated
[21:34:27] <idletask> Is that test only for IE6- or something?
[21:34:39] <coldhead> it's a good time to remove it for people and submit a pull request :D
[21:34:44] <Cork> sure
[21:34:52] <Cork> idletask: regex :)
[21:34:57] <Cork> navigator.userAgent
[21:35:07] <idletask> Cork: like I care about IE6
[21:35:16] <Cork> idletask: same here
[21:35:31] <Cork> heck ie7 is even in the dumpster
[21:35:38] <Cork> *even ie7 is in
[21:35:53] <phonebook_> im gonna buy an ipad
[21:35:54] <tw2113> i only debug IE7 if i have to
[21:36:05] <idletask> Cork: at my old job, devs spent nearly a third of their time chasing workarounds for IE7- js bugs
[21:36:18] <phonebook_> you know, because of how practical they are
[21:36:41] <Cork> idletask: a few projects back i calculated with half the development time for adding support for ie6 >_>
[21:36:53] <idletask> Cork: I'm not surprised
[21:37:00] <Cork> "this project will take 4 weeks, 2 for all browsers and 2 for ie6" T_T
[21:37:09] <Cork> it was horrible
[21:37:40] <Cork> the workarounds for ie6 was sometimes longer then the rest of the site put together
[21:38:01] <Cork> though ie5.5 was even worse
[21:38:16] <raj> if I return a 403 because the user doesn't have sufficient permissions to access a page, can I still get ahold of the html in the `data` argument?
[21:38:21] <coldhead> bet those ie6 users sure were grateful "this is the first website i've used in years that actually works!"
[21:38:25] <raj> ...of .fail()
[21:38:37] <Cork> raj: yes, its in the responseXML
[21:38:49] <Cork> or was it responseText
[21:38:52] <phonebook_> the workarounds for offline storage while it was being solidifed were hell.
[21:39:02] <raj> thanks Cork
[21:39:04] <raj> responseText
[21:39:20] * Cork nods
[21:39:28] <LocalPCGuy> heh...most likely the ie6 user (singular) didn't know any better
[21:39:35] <Cork> LOL
[21:40:22] <Cork> funny enough looks like java is quickly becoming the legacy problematic dependency for companies
[21:40:32] <Cork> (java applet)
[21:41:05] <idletask> Applets should have died a long time ago anyway
[21:41:09] <raj> is it correct to have a console error if someone is trying to access a page before logging in?
[21:41:21] <Cork> java loaded in the browser should have been forbidden LONG time ago
[21:41:54] <Cork> raj: in development sure; but its pointless on production
[21:41:57] <rmill> raj: In general console.log should only be used for debugging purposes.
[21:42:11] <raj> Cork, what do you mean?
[21:42:15] <wolfgang42> There are some things that you can't do any other way besides Java though
[21:42:23] <rmill> As Cork mentioned, not once the site has gone into production
[21:42:24] <tw2113> console.log shouldn't be required for the browsing experience
[21:42:26] <raj> if I return a 403 from the server, it always shows up in the console with an error
[21:42:35] <Cork> raj: 1. the user won't see it; 2. it will slow down the speed; 3. ie < 9 will crash
[21:42:38] <raj> GET 403 (Forbidden)
[21:42:49] <raj> wow, that's sad
[21:42:50] <Cork> ah in the net tab?
[21:42:55] <Cork> thats fine
[21:43:01] <Cork> just not console.log
[21:43:04] <LocalPCGuy> you can use console.log to have a bit of fun for devs that may have a console on (given you fix it for IE)
[21:43:07] <raj> in the network tab as well as in console
[21:43:22] <raj> i'm not console.logging anything
[21:43:29] <wolfgang42> 403s appear in the console, yes
[21:43:30] <raj> i'm saying the error shows up in console anyway
[21:43:31] <Cork> if you mean a line from the actual request; thats fine
[21:43:36] <wolfgang42> That's perfectly normal
[21:43:41] <raj> ok
[21:43:45] <raj> wasn't sure if it was messy
[21:43:46] <Cork> theres no way to avoid that actually
[21:43:50] <raj> ok
[21:43:53] <Cork> not without adding another pointless request
[21:43:54] <raj> thank you :)
[21:48:55] <phonebook_> by ejecting from windows apple probably thinks they are help breaking up the concept of what a pc is
[21:49:09] <phiz> if ( ! window.console ) console = { log: function(){} };
[21:49:42] <phonebook_> which they are.... idk. maybe its a good thing
[21:51:17] <coldhead> we'll all be using tablets by the end of the year anyway
[21:51:45] <phonebook_> google glass has been promised to us in 2014
[21:52:33] <coldhead> i'm not really interested in glass until the headset can deliver powerful electric shocks
[21:52:41] <coldhead> that's just a feature i need
[21:53:33] <phonebook_> taht would be a handy feature
[21:54:08] <poot> Hello. I need help getting my page to trigger $(document).ready handler when the page is loaded via ajax. If you goto the pages url, it works as normal, until that page gets loaded with ajax. Any idea how to solve this?
[21:54:28] <phonebook_> are you in control of the ajax call?
[21:55:01] <Cork> poot: document.ready isn't called if you append the code to another page
[21:55:09] <Cork> poot: you can't do it like that
[21:55:24] <poot> yes i am, im ajaxing in pages from my site
[21:55:24] <Cork> you need to put the code in a function that you explicitly call
[21:55:46] <poot> so i would just recall an init() function after a successful ajax call?
[21:56:00] <phonebook_> so could you use complete: function() {} to do your work?
[21:56:02] <Cork> for example
[21:56:34] <idletask> Hmmm, anyone using qtip?
[21:56:55] <idletask> I cannot make it show its popup above the element (which is an <a> element but I don't think it matters, does it?)
[21:56:59] <wolfgang42> phonebook_: Google glass looks really interesting...
[21:57:18] <poot> The problem is that im not sure exactly what page is being loaded. I could click on a number of links, and any number of pages could load. One particular page has a bunch of javascript code inside that i need executed when its ready
[21:57:25] <phonebook_> wolfgang42, agreed.
[21:57:58] * wolfgang42 wants
[21:57:59] <Cork> idletask: where the qtip element is added on the page, overflow rules and z-index is all that matters
[21:58:19] <Cork> (well and position rules)
[21:58:20] <phonebook_> if you inject it it is ready on the very next line
[21:58:38] <phonebook_> if you are puttin in an iframe you can drill down into the iframe and do a window.onready = myCodel
[21:58:40] <phonebook_> ;
[21:59:03] <idletask> Argh
[21:59:08] <idletask> PEBKAC
[21:59:35] <Cork> phonebook_: there is no onready event
[22:00:14] <Cork> and there is similar event attribute
[22:00:47] <Cork> you do have DOMContentLoaded, but its not an event attribute
[22:01:32] <Cork> *and there is no similar
[22:01:42] <poot> are you guys talking about my problem lol
[22:01:58] <Cork> poot: yes
[22:02:17] <Cork> poot: when you load code through ajax, its not a page load
[22:02:23] <Cork> its a modification to the current page
[22:02:35] <poot> I feel like its sortof bad practice to run anything from a success load handler
[22:02:47] <poot> the page should just run... as soon as its placed down
[22:03:00] <Cork> so you won't trigger DOMContentLoaded or Load; and those are what $().ready depends on
[22:03:28] <poot> i see
[22:03:32] <Cork> poot: well you could just put the code inline in the html
[22:03:40] <phonebook_> ah yeah
[22:03:42] <Cork> and jquery will strip them out and execute them
[22:03:44] <phonebook_> thats a good solution
[22:04:00] <phonebook_> ~~modular~~
[22:04:01] <poot> well most of it is in a script tag
[22:04:11] <Cork> ya, thats what i meant
[22:04:15] <poot> but its still executed from within a document.ready
[22:04:18] <poot> since it has parameters
[22:04:27] <poot> i have to call an init function with params
[22:04:40] <Cork> poot: like i said you shouldn't use $().ready on ajax responses
[22:05:04] <poot> well thats what i have now, im trying to find other solutions
[22:05:09] <Cork> poot: just like you shouldn't include <html>, <head>, <body>, <link> and so in in a ajax response
[22:05:27] <Cork> as that means the html is invalid
[22:05:43] <poot> yeah im just pulling the content
[22:06:06] <Cork> the term you're using for loading the html is "page" but when you load ajax thats not what it is
[22:06:10] <Cork> its a partial, not a page
[22:06:31] <matthewgonzalez> anyone here familiar with extend jQuery UI widgets?
[22:06:32] <Cork> so all the normal flow you think of when you load a page normally in a tab goes out the window
[22:06:37] <matthewgonzalez> extending*
[22:06:42] <poot> i see.
[22:06:44] <poot> but i still need some way to execute the code when it gets loaded
[22:06:50] <Cork> ?ask @ matthewgonzalez
[22:06:52] <bot-t> matthewgonzalez, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[22:07:21] <phonebook_> ive tried it. jquery bridge design pattern. but it can also be done with straight css sometimes. i dont think it is worth learning
[22:07:55] <Cork> poot: 1. put the code inline in the partial without wrapper; 2. run the js as a handler (success); 3. send the html in the js as a string and send it all that way
[22:07:55] <poot> should the main parent page have a lot of logic regarding what type of content is being loaded?
[22:07:56] <matthewgonzalez> I have a simple test extension. You can see that the "dragstop" event is no longer being fired. herehttp://jsfiddle.net/WHvnj/
[22:08:01] <matthewgonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/WHvnj/
[22:08:32] <Cork> poot: depends on how much logic is needed; if the page is sufficiently small; sure; else you want to split it up
[22:09:08] <poot> lemme try just taking it out of the document ready handler
[22:10:49] <phonebook_> there is an html5 attribute draggable which is supposed to be better than draggable (and probably faster code)
[22:11:40] <Cork> matthewgonzalez: when you add functions with the same name as the original widget you don't extend those functions you replace them
[22:11:53] <matthewgonzalez> i was thinking maybe steering away from ui.draggable but am needing the droppable as well
[22:12:30] <matthewgonzalez> Cork: I pulled over pretty much the entire code from the ui.draggable widget for that function
[22:12:34] <Cork> matthewgonzalez: so if you want to extend them you need to call the original function afterwards
[22:13:09] <trinadh> matthewgonzalez: use mouseup in place of dragstop, it should work..
[22:13:37] <matthewgonzalez> (there was a very specific reason to edit the positioning logic for draggable in my project, so I couldn't just pull in the base function as it was)
[22:13:59] <Cork> trinadh: thats a hack not a fix
[22:14:07] <poot> Cork, if I create an inline block of js inside my segment, it would mean it requires any necessary scripts to be defined before that segment, right?
[22:14:30] <b-lew> http://landpros.turnpostinteractive.com/LandPros_Details2_1.html# -> the Map Key to the right of the page has a jquery UI element on it. I'm needing it to toggle open and close but am not having luck. Can I get some help real quick?
[22:14:42] <Cork> poot: or included in that segment yes
[22:15:00] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/5806228
[22:15:04] <b-lew> is the code I'm using
[22:16:13] <Cork> matthewgonzalez: if you check the draggable code for _dragStop it calls this._trigger("stop", event)
[22:16:34] <Cork> matthewgonzalez: so either you need to do that too; or you need to call draggables _dragStop function
[22:17:24] <matthewgonzalez> Cork: would I need to pull in the function for each event into my extension and use _super for each?
[22:17:45] <Cork> matthewgonzalez: there is no super (as far as i know)
[22:18:21] <matthewgonzalez> Cork: so just dupe all of the event functions that don't utilize _super?
[22:18:22] <Cork> but ya you need to call the $.Widget.prototype.<original widget>.function.apply(this, arguments)
[22:18:55] <phonebook_> also its easy to get a basic draggable http://jsfiddle.net/WHvnj/1/
[22:18:55] <Cork> matthewgonzalez: like i said as far as i know there isn't any _super function
[22:19:01] <raj> phonebook_, I returned my mbp the other day
[22:19:05] <raj> didn't like it at all
[22:19:09] <phonebook_> mbp?
[22:19:25] <matthewgonzalez> seems oddâ€¦ it doesn't inherit the extended widgets other functions
[22:19:41] <Cork> matthewgonzalez: it inherits them; sure; but you overwrite them
[22:19:51] <Cork> you can only have one copy of a function with the same name
[22:20:04] <idletask> Hmmm, I have one small problem with qtip: when the tooltip text changes and takes less space than the previous text, the old text still appears under the new popup
[22:20:05] <matthewgonzalez> does overwriting _mouseStart overwrite _dragStop as well?
[22:20:10] <Cork> no
[22:20:12] <phonebook_> ...google ultimate gradient generator for the coolest gradients
[22:20:13] <idletask> Is that a bug or am I doing something wrong?

[22:20:17] <matthewgonzalez> or is there a connection lost when I overwrote _mouseStart
[22:20:35] <Cork> you would have to dig into what _mouseStart does in draggable
[22:20:46] <phonebook_> thx b-ot. wil go through them.
[22:20:53] <Cork> there might be something there that it needs
[22:27:38] <poot> Cork, i removed the ready wrapper, but the inline js isn't being ran ... any idea why?
[22:27:52] <syntac> hi, if I'm using RaphaelJS, is it possible to reference elements defined inside Raphael(function() { ... };); from any script? (#javascript did not know)
[22:27:53] <Cork> poot: it should be
[22:27:58] <poot> It gets placed into the page with $.ajax.success( $content.html(data)
[22:28:20] <Cork> poot: is it using something like document.write?
[22:29:10] <poot> nope dont think so
[22:30:40] <b-lew> is there a reason why my code isn't working with direction?
[22:30:40] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/5806897
[22:31:51] <b-lew> it works fine until i add the direction
[22:31:53] <b-lew> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/ui-toggle-options-specifically-can-i-change-the-direction-from-which-it-slides-in
[22:33:33] <phonebook_> i just wrote a bomb regex and no one cared. boo hoo
[22:33:44] <poot> Cork, wait a minute. Im using ajaxify and it finds all scripts on the page and detaches them and attempts to place them back in with document.createElement
[22:33:53] <poot> in success
[22:33:54] <phonebook_> well maybe not "bomb" but at least somewhat cool
[22:34:20] <tw2113> phonebook_, does it find and select "bomb" from strings?
[22:34:45] <phonebook_> ah tw.... sry i remember now. lol. i called you boring a few weeks ago and left after you didnt like my cuboid
[22:35:05] <tw2113> i'm fine with that
[22:35:23] <phonebook_> if bomb were the www part of a domain
[22:35:59] <phonebook_> tw2113, ive got two-3 more modules im working on. will release them as plugins at some point if they are ever good enough.
[22:36:08] <phonebook_> .....wanna see?
[22:36:16] <phonebook_> at this point im gonna show and tell anyway
[22:36:30] <tw2113> so show and tell, i won't guarantee clicks from me though :D
[22:39:24] <idletask> Hmmm, OK
[22:39:38] <idletask> How do you _destroy_ a qtip previously linked to an element?
[22:39:40] <phonebook_> i think this one is the most interesting. look at it in chrome cause its fastest. click a tab and drag down http://jsfiddle.net/j7MGY/
[22:42:20] <phonebook_> this one - which also has to be viewed in chrome - but i have a better version now that runs in all 5 - http://jsfiddle.net/adfVJ/
[22:43:47] <phonebook_> and this one - http://jsfiddle.net/zc7pk/
[22:43:57] <phonebook_> and that resizer window thing is a module too
[22:44:24] <phonebook_> i some other cool stuff but they woudlnt seem cool in their current form. want to get them super cool and give them away
[22:44:54] <phonebook_> and no one will care, fine. but .... they probably dont see what i see
[22:46:25] <phonebook_> its okay if you dont like it or dont get it. just wanted to do show and tell
[22:55:57] <phonebook_> if you want to destroy a q-top dont throw it in the tiolet. and dont throw it in the trash because they are not biodegradable. its best to keep them in an empty jar of weigh protein until science invents a solution.
[23:02:08] <codechip> getting a error on jquery autocomplete image as "Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html"
[23:02:10] <codechip> any ideas?
[23:02:25] <codechip> not error, but kinda warning
[23:02:28] <Cork> you're sending it from a php script?
[23:02:33] <Cork> or similar?
[23:02:56] <codechip> yeah i'm using a procedure to return XML data
[23:03:05] <codechip> using mod pl/sql
[23:03:20] <Cork> you have to either return an url to the image
[23:03:31] <Cork> or data-uri encode it
[23:04:00] <codechip> okay...lemme try to implement this
[23:40:31] <phonebook_> does anyone else sense that jquery is getting kind of old?
[23:42:04] <phonebook_> or maybe not old. but not as edgey
[23:42:21] <benjick> Hi. Does anyone know of a jquery slider with image tagging?
[23:42:32] <phonebook_> image tagging?
[23:43:57] <benjick> phonebook_: Hm, not sure if it's the word, but you mouseover a dot or area on an image and get a popup
[23:44:11] <benjick> phonebook_: Maybe I can add that to nivo, now that i think about it
[23:44:31] <phonebook_> how does the slider play into this?
[23:44:53] <benjick> phonebook_: well, it doesn't, i just realized it's two separate things
[23:44:58] <benjick> that i just can combine
[23:45:05] <phonebook_> cool
[23:45:21] <benjick> i guess sometimes you just have to say it
[23:45:22] <benjick> :)
[23:45:25] <benjick> thanks for listening
[23:57:40] <phonebook_> so not one word was said about the modules i am working on
[23:58:14] <phonebook_> im guessing because everyone looked at them and though.. .boring... or saw something broken.
[23:58:54] <phonebook_> they're not DONE.
[23:59:28] <phonebook_> and they arent even very cool compared to other stuff. but at least im trying to make something
