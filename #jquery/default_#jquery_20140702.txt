[00:08:01] <marcules> Good Morning
[02:37:07] <manus> hello folks, quick question about the jquery ui "no-theme" css -- there is a reference to images/animated-overlay.gif, but the file isn't included in the download. is this expected?
[02:53:26] <manus> it might be easier to convert that to a data url, since it seems to be the only reference to an external image in the non-themed css
[03:08:19] <manus> ah, but there might an issue with using data urls for animates gifs..
[03:08:27] <manus> *animated
[03:08:42] <Cork> manus: only that some older browsers doesn't support it
[03:08:51] <Cork> and you get the base64 overhead
[03:09:04] <Cork> (though on the other head you lose the connection overhead)
[03:09:20] <manus> Cork: there are other base64-encoded images in the css already
[03:09:42] <Cork> manus: i just listed all cons for adding it in the css
[03:10:18] <manus> I'm just suggesting replacing the one image that is referenced (but not included in the "no theme" CSS) with a data url
[03:10:22] <Cork> it wasn't a judgment of doing it specifically in that css file
[03:11:01] <manus> I'm wondering which jquery ui-supported browsers don't support data urls
[03:11:52] <Cork> manus: ie<8
[03:12:18] <manus> oh, cool, jquery ui doesn't support ie<8 anymore :]
[03:12:26] <Cork> it doesn't??
[03:12:41] <Cork> i'm quite sure it does
[03:13:04] <manus> as of last week: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2014/06/jquery-ui-1-11-0/
[03:13:25] <slax0r> if .parents([selector]) returns only one element, can I not normally run functions on it?
[03:13:36] <manus> Cork: http://jqueryui.com/browser-support/
[03:13:37] <Cork> manus: ah, they mean they don't test it on ie<8
[03:13:42] <Cork> but it works just fine there
[03:13:47] <Cork> at least in ie7
[03:13:48] <manus> Cork: for now
[03:13:51] <Cork> sure
[03:14:05] <Cork> most developers don't care too much about ie < 9
[03:14:08] <slax0r> nvm
[03:14:38] <Cork> slax0r: you can, though you most likely want .closest() not parents()
[03:15:32] <slax0r> Cork: most probably
[03:18:08] <slax0r> Cork: does .closest only take parents, or would it find siblings as well?
[03:18:32] <Cork> slax0r: .closest() is ~= to .parents().first()
[03:19:04] <Cork> except .closest also checks the current element
[03:20:02] <Cork> <div id="a"><div id="b"><div id="c"></div></div></div> $('#c').closest('div').attr('id') === 'c'
[03:21:53] <slax0r> but not its siblings...
[03:21:58] <slax0r> and I'm an idiot...
[03:22:02] <slax0r> I missed a . in the selecotr
[03:23:08] <Guest___> what's a good string substitution library?
[03:23:36] <sammich_> I'm familiar with dojo.string.substitude
[03:23:51] <Cork> sammich_: you want substitute or a template engine?
[03:23:52] <sammich_> but I'd like a standalone method
[03:24:14] <Cork> cause replacing words in a string is supported natively
[03:24:14] <sammich_> just the substitute, I'm still evaluating if I need a full templating engine
[03:24:31] <Cork> .replace('old', 'new')
[03:24:39] <Cork> 'old' could be a regex expression
[03:24:48] <sammich_> the dojo one does look up into objects and arrays
[03:24:56] <Cork> uh
[03:25:01] <Cork> you said string
[03:25:16] <Cork> objects and arrays isn't strings
[03:25:33] <sammich_> okay, maybe the word template might fall into this
[03:25:40] <Cork> so it sounds like you need to explain what you need
[03:25:47] <sammich_> the string is just a giant HTML document
[03:26:28] <Cork> sammich_: template is something like "this is an example ${ input }".template_engine_name('string')
[03:26:38] <Cork> uh sorry
[03:26:41] <sammich_> okay, terminology is off?
[03:26:43] <Cork> sammich_: template is something like "this is an example ${ input }".template_engine_name({ input: 'string' })
[03:26:47] <Cork> is prob a better example
[03:26:56] <sammich_> yeah, that's what I'm looking for
[03:27:06] <Cork> ok so you're looking for a template engine
[03:27:23] <Cork> underscore, jqote, mustache
[03:27:26] <Cork> is a few examples
[03:27:29] <sammich_> in my mind a template engine built the HTML...which I guess it could do
[03:27:36] <sammich_> never mind
[03:27:39] <sammich_> I want a template engine ;)
[03:27:46] <Cork> underscore, jqote, mustache <--
[03:28:25] <sammich_> any reason to pick one over another?
[03:28:43] <Cork> underscore is a good choice if you need the rest of the lib
[03:28:48] <Cork> jqote is small and fast
[03:28:58] <Cork> mustache is another good example
[03:29:12] <Cork> i use jqote2
[03:29:16] <Cork> ?g jqote2
[03:29:17] <sammich_> I'm researching a client editable template thingy
[03:29:18] <b-ot> Cork: jQote2 â€“ Javascript templating revamped : once upon my code â†’ http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[03:29:52] <sammich_> dragging and dropping placeholder tags for variable content
[03:30:56] <sammich_> the actual templating will be run server side, which gets run via wkhtmltopdf to output to PDF
[03:31:54] <sammich_> thanks, btw
[03:39:03] <donni> hi can I connect here through kiwi IRC?
[03:39:50] <Cork> donni: sure
[03:41:12] <donni> hi Cork, how to send an image here ? this image explain lot's about my question
[03:41:33] <Cork> donni: you would have to upload the image on a web host
[03:41:40] <Cork> donni: though don't just post images
[03:41:43] <Cork> ask the question
[03:41:52] <Cork> and if needed ppl will ask for an image
[03:41:58] <Cork> and DON'T post images of code
[03:42:01] <donni> or can we discuss about a website that already exist?
[03:42:11] <Cork> depends on the question
[03:42:17] <donni> I'd like learn ther style
[03:42:30] <donni> style of their website
[03:42:43] <donni> I want to implement it to my site
[03:43:20] <Cork> donni: doesn't sound like a jquery question
[03:43:47] <Cork> and dissecting the site will be down to you
[03:44:06] <Cork> you're welcome to ask specific questions for parts you don't understand though
[03:45:17] <donni> okay wait :D
[04:05:40] <ddssc> how do I link an url to a jq ui tab?
[04:24:11] <xec> ddssc: i think you can just append the hash of the id of the tab iirc
[04:29:43] <xec> ddssc: like, to link to the second tab of http://jsfiddle.net/tWvdp just do http://jsfiddle.net/tWvdp/show/#tabs-2
[04:35:08] <BinaryKitten> xec it's harder to do so with jsfiddle since the # on the url doesn't transfer to the child frame
[04:35:41] <xec> thats why i added /show, so theres no frame
[04:36:03] <ddssc> xec, thing is I was thinking how would I go about putting urls in tab links so that when clicked the url in the taskbar actually changes
[04:36:23] <BinaryKitten> ah yes. forgot that they added ability to view the frame separately now
[04:36:35] <Cork> BinaryKitten: it has been supported for ages
[04:36:55] <BinaryKitten> Cork: only recently been made aware..
[04:37:05] <Cork> heh ok :)
[04:37:25] <xec> ddssc: i see, i don't think you can do that out of the box
[04:37:44] <ddssc> xec, yea figured that much, gonna make handlers for it
[04:37:55] <Cork> ddssc: sounds like what you want is to update the document.title based on the hash
[04:38:23] <xec> i think he means address bar, not task bar
[04:38:35] <xec> (there's usually not a url in the task bar)
[04:38:53] <Cork> it should already do that
[04:39:10] <Cork> so the only thing i can think of is the title
[04:39:52] <xec> ah right
[04:40:26] <xec> well. then, ddssc: does your url not change when you click a tab?
[04:42:13] <ddssc> xec, nope
[04:42:26] <tapia> Hi! I'm trying to do an ajax validation in my form's submit() event, but I don't know how to send the form after the ajax .then()
[04:42:32] <ddssc> yea i  mean address bar obviously
[04:42:33] <tapia> this is my function: http://dpaste.com/2P59C46
[04:42:40] <xec> ddssc: does it do it at http://jsfiddle.net/tWvdp/show/ ?
[04:43:00] <xec> ddssc: like, if you click tab 3, doesn't your address bar url change?
[04:43:20] <ddssc> xec, yes it does. strange
[04:43:51] <Cork> ddssc: you prob add a event.preventDefault() or return false; to a click handler
[04:44:33] <ddssc> Cork, don't think I got a click handler, lemme see
[04:44:55] <Cork> btw, for the fun of it :) http://fiddle.jshell.net/tWvdp/4/show/
[04:45:10] <xec> hehe nice
[04:45:11] <basiclases> hey guys
[04:45:39] <basiclases> With js/jq can i write something that takes any file, reduces it to small sequenced packets
[04:45:42] <basiclases> ?
[04:45:54] <BinaryKitten> no
[04:46:01] <BinaryKitten> well depends
[04:46:02] <Cork> basiclases: js doens't have files
[04:46:07] <BinaryKitten> are you doing it serverside?
[04:46:12] <Cork> it has resources
[04:46:25] <BinaryKitten> Cork unless you run via node
[04:46:29] <BinaryKitten> node has files
[04:46:31] <Cork> BinaryKitten: true
[04:46:48] <Cork> so does any privileged js
[04:47:00] <BinaryKitten> basiclases  are you writing server side JS or client side JS
[04:47:36] <BinaryKitten> client side is harder to achieve that as techincally you can't actually open/read the external file without employing something like flash or Java
[04:48:03] <Cork> well you can from <input type="file"> or the drop event
[04:48:15] <dawie23434> hello, very new to jquery and js. Was wondering how i would make this piece of code work so that TableData is populated on document load? http://jsbin.com/fovidida/1/edit Thank you for any help given
[04:48:19] <Cork> but not without user intervention
[04:48:22] <BinaryKitten> can't open the file though Cork
[04:48:27] <BinaryKitten> can you?
[04:48:33] <Cork> BinaryKitten: it can't select the file, but it can get the content
[04:48:47] <Cork> ?mdn FileReader
[04:48:49] <b-ot> Cork: FileReader - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader
[04:50:09] <BinaryKitten> interesting
[04:50:56] <BinaryKitten> new (to me) mdn style looks cool
[04:51:24] <Cork> BinaryKitten: they have added a lot of file apis to the dom
[04:51:33] <BinaryKitten> scary
[04:51:38] <Cork> not really
[04:51:44] <Cork> you have no way to enter an path
[04:52:01] <Cork> the file object to access the file has to be given to you by the browser
[04:52:11] <Cork> and there is only two ways to do that
[04:58:56] <basiclases> BinaryKitten: i'm willing to consider node if its not possible client side, and AFAIK filesystem API is dead.
[04:59:36] <Cork> basiclases: uh, no it isn't it is even very new
[04:59:52] <Cork> but yes if you need support in older ie you can't use it
[05:01:09] <basiclases> im only going off what it says here> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/ what do you make of that 'heads up!' do you think it stands a chance in the future?
[05:01:46] <basiclases> I'm inclined to do it even with poorish support just to build a proof of concept and then try my hand at android
[05:02:05] <Cork> basiclases: well they arn't really correct even on what was supported when the article was written
[05:02:18] <Cork> basiclases: not true
[05:06:50] <xec> tapia: if i remember correctly, you can call .submit() from inside the submit handler without it causing a loop
[05:07:43] <Cork> xec: only ify ou call it on the dom element, and not the jquery object
[05:12:38] <xec> tapia: http://jsfiddle.net/m3ghM/
[05:13:40] <xec> the json error from jsfiddle lets you know the form actually submitted ;)
[05:18:40] <tapia> xec: if I do that, the submit handler is fired over and over again
[05:18:54] <xec> tapia: note what Cork said
[05:19:13] <xec> tapia: call it on the native form element, not the jquery object
[05:19:31] <Cork> Tapani: $('form').submit(); vs $('form')[0].submit();
[05:19:42] <xec> so, form.get(0).submit(); if you did form = $(this)
[05:19:54] <Cork> or just this.submit() :)
[05:20:09] <xec> except this might be something else inside the .then()
[05:20:09] <tapia> oh!!
[05:20:20] <tapia> sounds very hacky :-)
[05:20:42] <xec> tapia: or you could just do var form = this; like i did in that demo
[05:21:44] <tapia> ok, let me try
[05:22:19] <tapia> perfect!!
[05:22:24] <tapia> thank you, guys :-) :-)
[05:27:36] <xec> dawie23434: i'm not 100% sure what you're asking. maybe something like this? http://jsbin.com/fovidida/2/edit
[05:30:03] <dawie23434> xec: Thank you, basiccaly
[05:30:07] <dawie23434> xed
[05:30:30] <dawie23434> xec: basically i want that code to run when all my js and css has loaded in so when all documents had finished loading
[05:31:05] <xec> yeah ok, i think that should work then
[05:31:17] <dawie23434> Thanks a lot, much appreciated :)
[05:35:35] <xec> dawie23434: on the other hand, window load only fires after images etc has loaded too. you might be better off with $(document).ready(function(){ /* DOM is ready */});
[06:36:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone know how to make a toilet paper rolldown effect? the paper has an image on it, hwich should roll down like rolling down toilet paper
[06:42:55] <ciqsteve> Q: I have a self-executing anonymous function that adds a div to the dom (the div contains a notification to the user).  the function the removes the div after 5 seconds
[06:43:21] <ciqsteve> problem:  this can be called several times in a row so that there are multiple msgs on the screen.
[06:45:12] <ciqsteve> hmm nvr mind.. I gotta think about this some more
[06:54:29] <Ownix> My updateStar() function does not work when its INSIDE the fail callback http://jsfiddle.net/Lord_Zero/JzS3H/
[06:54:47] <Ownix> If I move UpdateStar() out of the callback and to right above where I make the call, everything works
[06:54:58] <Ownix> I know it has to do with async stuff... but I cant figure this out
[06:57:03] <Cork> Ownix: it is a bit hard to answer as the demo doesn't work
[06:57:59] <Cork> Ownix: though i don't see anything wrong with the code
[06:58:28] <Cork> UpdateStar isn't ever called from a callback
[06:58:42] <Cork> the closest you get is in the event handler from click
[06:59:05] <Cork> ah
[06:59:09] <Cork> now i see what it is
[06:59:24] <Cork> Ownix: functions define this every time you call a function
[06:59:44] <Cork> Ownix: so $(this) is NOT the same thing inside the $.post callback as it is outside it
[07:00:05] <Cork> a simple var self = $(this); before and using self inside should fix the problem
[07:00:11] <Cork> (and no this isn't async related)
[07:02:19] <Ownix> okay let me play with the fiddle now so I understand
[07:04:00] <sammich_> trying to find a solution to set the caret in a contenteditable at specific point
[07:04:06] <Ownix> Cork: that makes more help, thanks for this
[07:04:25] <Ownix> In KnockoutJS I see a lot of examples do var self = this; first in the ViewModel
[07:04:27] <Ownix> Makes sense now
[07:08:30] <sammich_> trying to drop elements into a editable area
[07:08:41] <sammich_> but want to have feedback on the position
[07:09:27] <sammich_> I can insert code where I click, but that relies on the default click event
[07:09:45] <sammich_> that event is obviously not fired when hovering over the content
[07:10:11] <sammich_> because the click set the caret position
[07:10:48] <sammich_> if I can set the caret position to where the mouse is (during drag) then I should be able to call the function to insert HTML
[07:11:24] <tiblock> Hi. I have blocks with text and if there is too much line of text i need make button "show full message". What is best solution to detect if there is too much lines?
[07:11:26] <Cork> sammich_: have you tried do it with d&d?
[07:11:45] <sammich_> native dnd?
[07:11:53] <Cork> ya
[07:11:56] <Cork> the dnd events
[07:12:09] <sammich_> kinda stepped away from it
[07:12:16] <msafi> If I have <a>Foo <span>bar</span></a>, how can I get just the text 'Foo'?
[07:12:18] <sammich_> just relying on jQ atm
[07:12:28] <Cork> msafi: you can't really do that
[07:12:44] <sammich_> children.remove()
[07:12:47] <sammich_> .text()
[07:12:49] <b-ot> sammich_: usually nicer
[07:12:58] <Cork> msafi: var link = $('a').clone(); link.children().remove(); link.text()
[07:13:06] <Cork> but ya, it is really horribly
[07:13:12] <Cork> *horrible
[07:13:29] <Cork> msafi: normally the best option is to add an additional span element
[07:13:49] <sammich_> assuming I go back to native dnd, does that set the caret for me on drag, or?
[07:14:10] <msafi>  Okay, thanks a lot guys!
[07:14:12] <Cork> sammich_: not sure, but i think it does
[07:15:51] <sammich_> I'll check out some examples. thanks
[07:19:18] <sammich_> oh hey, it totally does set the caret on drag
[07:23:24] <sammich_> hmm, it doesn't look like it actually does anything
[07:23:51] <sammich_> it shows a caret, but it's just a visual aid than an actual thing
[07:23:57] <sammich_> actual caret change
[07:24:13] <sammich_> still, the visual aid is far better than what I have going with jQuery
[07:24:16] <sammich_> draggable
[07:24:21] <sammich_> thanks again
[07:35:55] <Whirl3d> What happened to jsfiddle? It used to give helpful errors. Now all I get is undefined is not a function.
[07:36:09] <Whirl3d> I have been pasting my code to jsbin just to get some real errors.
[07:46:13] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: Does it have a line number?
[07:49:59] <Whirl3d> sure, but in jsbin I take the same text and it tells me :Malformed Regexp. Why can't jsfiddle do that?
[07:50:51] <BillCriswell> I have no idea haha.
[07:51:19] <BillCriswell> Can I see the code in question? Curious.
[07:56:24] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/k3CZX/   I can't get my regexp to find the line with Content-Transfer-Encoding... ugg it worked yesterday...
[08:01:51] <Whirl3d> forgot the "m" in my regexp
[08:07:14] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/k3CZX/7/
[08:08:01] <Whirl3d> in my formatEmail function, I log email_obj and get the expected result. But then I try to read email_obj["Message-ID"] and get undefined though it shows in the object...how?
[08:10:50] <systemfault> Whirl3d: I can see it work here :/
[08:11:03] <systemfault> Your console.log returns  <0e83b7d64669024747ee3d7935132f21@css-tricks.com>
[08:12:59] <Whirl3d> I am having problems with the fact that the labels are proper case and need to be proper case to search, but the classes are lower case. What a mess
[08:18:08] <BillCriswell> Regular expessions are so fun sometimes.
[08:18:24] <Whirl3d> can .filter return an array of strings rather than a jquery object?
[08:18:29] <Whirl3d> or do I need to use .map
[08:19:08] <systemfault> I think there's .grep (shitty name) for what you want to do
[08:19:17] <systemfault> (If I understand it properly)
[08:19:49] <duch_kazatel> .filter() is just for jquery objects iirc.
[08:20:24] <duch_kazatel> yep - http://api.jquery.com/filter/ "reduce the set of matched elements"
[08:24:56] <decx> whats wrong with map, thats what it's there for
[08:25:17] <duch_kazatel> people really like using jquery for EVERYTHING.  even when it's totally unnecessary.
[08:26:31] <decx> i didnt mean the real map
[08:26:32] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: Hehâ€¦ personally, I leave jQuery for what it's good at: DOM Manipulations/Ajax
[08:26:34] <decx> i meant the jq map
[08:26:50] <duch_kazatel> decx ah
[08:27:02] <systemfault> The rest of the time, I use what ES5 gives meâ€¦. .map/.filter/.reduce.. etc. :P
[08:27:18] <BillCriswell> I'm doing it with split(regex) for fun for some reason
[08:28:21] <BillCriswell> headers.split(/(^|\n)([^\s]+:)/) worked
[08:28:27] <BillCriswell> just have to like... clean it up
[08:29:41] <Whirl3d> so close: http://jsfiddle.net/k3CZX/14/
[08:31:10] <Whirl3d> ugggg  Tidyup messed up my returns. LOL
[08:35:43] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/k3CZX/19/
[08:36:14] <Whirl3d> works!  Now I just have to get my date, and addresses fixed along with the body text formatted.
[08:37:11] <Rejected> Hi guys. I have a form within which is a table with the option to dynamically append rows to it. The tr element I'm cloning has a class of 'newField'. Now what I'd like to get done is somehow have a hidden input field to be posted with the rest of the form with the total number of rows, as returned by $('tr.newField').length. Is that possible? I hope I'm making any sense.
[08:37:32] <NoiseEee> Rejected: sure, why not
[08:37:45] <duch_kazatel> Rejected sure.  you could update that field every time you add a row.
[08:37:50] <Rejected> how would I go about it, then?
[08:37:51] <NoiseEee> Rejected: when you're cloning, after the successful append, update the value
[08:38:08] <BillCriswell> I've been sleeping on .reduce(), I don't write enough JS.
[08:38:09] <duch_kazatel> $('#yourInput').val($('tr.newField').length);
[08:38:38] <Rejected> The thing is, how to print the length (the number itself) to the page the form is being posted to.
[08:38:48] <Rejected> ops.. sorry. Didn't see that, duch_kazatel
[08:40:08] <Rejected> I'll give it a try. Thanks everyone :)
[08:42:09] <MikeD_> is there a way to catch the input that defaults to type text in addition to the one explicitly defined as type text?  http://jsfiddle.net/w4z2J/
[08:42:31] <duch_kazatel> wut
[08:42:34] <MikeD_> (without also catching the radio or checkbox or email or whatever other types)
[08:42:44] <duch_kazatel> oh you mean selecting them?
[08:42:44] <MikeD_> s/catch/select
[08:42:58] <MikeD_> i meant catch as in "not miss"
[08:45:28] <MikeD_> i'm trying to update some heavy-handed code that sets the .val() of any input with a given name... designed by someone thinking only of a type=text input with no regard for how that affects radio, checkbox, etc.
[08:45:53] <duch_kazatel> afaik you'd need to run a .filter() and test .prop('type')\
[08:48:40] <MikeD_> academic question:  do you think unspecified type should be reported as type text?
[08:48:44] <shoky> there's the :text selector for that
[08:48:53] <shoky> `api :text
[08:48:53] <b-ot> shoky: :text Selector: Selects all elements of type text. http://api.jquery.com/text-selector/
[08:49:05] <MikeD_> that's a nice bot :)
[08:49:24] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input - "The type of control to display. The default type is text, if this attribute is not specified. Possible values are: "
[08:49:32] <duch_kazatel> why do i always forget things like :text ?!
[08:50:10] <shoky> prolly cause you don't forget things like type="text" ;]
[08:50:29] <duch_kazatel> i was thinking of something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/w4z2J/1/
[08:50:31] <choffstein> Is it possible to have a function call that appends() an element with an anchor link tag that, in turn, references the function itself?
[08:50:47] <duch_kazatel> choffstein do what now?
[08:50:52] <choffstein> The anchor link seems to show up with the append, but clicking on it does nothing for me.
[08:50:59] <choffstein> Yeah, that was word vomit.  Sorry.
[08:51:01] <duch_kazatel> choffstein ah - delegation
[08:51:19] <duch_kazatel> $(parent).on('click', 'a', function() {});
[08:51:21] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want.
[08:51:38] <duch_kazatel> where parent is something that exists on pageload.
[08:51:59] <MikeD_> thanks duch_kazatel, shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/w4z2J/2/
[08:52:22] <choffstein> duch_kazatel: Okay.  I'll give that a swing.  Likely back in 30 seconds :D
[08:55:24] <choffstein> That ... was surprisingly easy.  Thanks.
[08:55:37] <duch_kazatel> yep.  read up on event delegation/bubbling.
[08:55:54] <duch_kazatel> it's a favorite concept of mine and really simplifies your code.
[08:56:41] <decx> til i can use a gradient for a stroke style
[08:56:56] <decx> cool effect http://jsfiddle.net/decx/K7WMG/
[08:59:59] <BillCriswell> decx: puuurdy
[09:00:33] <duch_kazatel> til decx does neat things.
[09:00:42] <duch_kazatel> jk you've always done neat things.
[09:00:54] <decx> if i weren't so shit at math i'm sure i could create a cloth like effect with mouse interaction
[09:01:09] <decx> beziercurves are confusing
[09:01:24] <BillCriswell> Those letters just look confusing.
[09:02:05] <Whirl3d> Much better. Just took me a second. http://jsfiddle.net/NhGQ4/3/ Now it parses all headers. Just need to add body
[09:09:05] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: http://jsbin.com/tejoxofa/1/edit I was just doing sort of the same thing lol
[09:10:06] <BillCriswell> Don't know why I felt obligated to try and figure that out.
[09:10:29] <BillCriswell> decx: So how would you write that better?
[09:10:39] <BillCriswell> Just tips, not asking for actual code haha
[09:14:58] <BillCriswell> Just using a for loop probably...
[09:15:55] <linagee> is there a way in jquery 1.10 to inspect the .bind that have been done to keyup?
[09:16:24] <duch_kazatel> linagee you can look at all handlers bound to an element.
[09:16:31] <Whirl3d> decx, in order to not have the multiple lines on draw() do you have to undraw the previous line?
[09:16:45] <linagee> duch_kazatel: how? $._data() or something?
[09:17:10] <duch_kazatel> linagee yep, though I wouldn't rely on that in production code, just for troubleshooting.
[09:17:13] <linagee> duch_kazatel: I'm just trying to troubleshoot obviously, not programmatically inspect for .bind
[09:17:17] <linagee> jinx
[09:17:25] <duch_kazatel> linagee also, trying to use .on() instead of .bind()
[09:17:34] <jakk89> im trying to add different classes depending my ajax response back. For some reason i always get the alert danger class as my example shows.. any suggestion http://jsfiddle.net/rVe67/1/
[09:17:37] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel i release you from your jinx
[09:18:06] <linagee> duch_kazatel: trying to see if I can fix angular ui-utils ui-mask. (on mobile, it seems to register every key twice. I think I've narrowed it down to possible a double .bind thing.)
[09:18:25] <linagee> duch_kazatel: specifically: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-utils/issues/189
[09:18:48] <duch_kazatel> jakk89 do a console.log() of data.
[09:18:52] <duch_kazatel> also use === instead of ==
[09:19:02] <jakk89> ok
[09:19:23] <duch_kazatel> jakk89 make sure what you're getting back is what you thing.
[09:19:24] <duch_kazatel> *think
[09:20:18] <linagee> duch_kazatel: its kind of crazy that it happens on mobile chrome but not on desktop chrome. I don't even get that. (it could be some weird race condition, but I've already determined that .bind and .unbind are happening the same amount by adding console.log)
[09:20:42] <duch_kazatel> linagee angular is weird and strange to me.
[09:20:55] <linagee> https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-utils/blob/master/modules/mask/mask.js#L164
[09:21:29] <linagee> duch_kazatel: its probably something weird and strange causing this to happen. I've ran .bind / keyup jquery demo and nothing weird happens. but then you throw angular calling jquery into the mix.... :)
[09:21:45] <duch_kazatel> bummer for angular i guess.
[09:21:59] <linagee> duch_kazatel: on that link I posted, iElement is a jQuery object
[09:22:11] <cannap> Hi can tell me how i can use "$" i dont want use jQuery only $('blaaa') is not defined but jQuery('nlla') is working?
[09:22:27] <duch_kazatel> cannap you're in noconflict mode.
[09:22:39] <duch_kazatel> linagee it'd have to be a jquery object to use .bind()...
[09:22:48] <duch_kazatel> not sure why angular is still using bind tbh.
[09:22:56] <cannap> hmm
[09:23:06] <linagee> duch_kazatel: I'm not even sure how to troubleshoot it. :(  I've tried adding console.log into the event handler, that's how I know its calling it twice for every key...
[09:23:07] <jakk89> duch_kazatel:  when i console log data i get what im suppose to get but classes are not being displayed correctly
[09:23:20] <cannap> and how i leave this?
[09:23:27] <duch_kazatel> cannap you can use (function($) { /* your code here */ })(jQuery);
[09:23:40] <linagee> duch_kazatel: the bindEventListeners is being called twice in desktop/mobile....
[09:23:43] <duch_kazatel> linagee i don't know anything about angular so I can't really help you.
[09:23:44] <jakk89> duch_kazatel:  im wondering if i need to remove a class after i add it
[09:23:45] <cannap> i wrapped document read thing?
[09:23:50] <cannap> ready
[09:23:54] <cannap> ok wait i check this
[09:23:58] <duch_kazatel> cannap use what i showed you instead.
[09:24:32] <duch_kazatel> jakk89 .addClass() only adds classes. it doesn't change the current classes.
[09:25:02] <duch_kazatel> jakk89 i'd make sure you're hitting the right conditionals at the right times,.'
[09:26:20] <cannap> Works thx
[09:26:27] <linagee> duch_kazatel: that's so crazy. I just used Chrome's remote control for the input. keyup was only sent once! :(
[09:26:29] <duch_kazatel> cannap are you on wordpress?
[09:26:38] <duch_kazatel> linagee i really can't help you.
[09:26:41] <cannap> yes
[09:26:42] <linagee> :(
[09:26:43] <duch_kazatel> linagee i know nothing about angular.
[09:26:46] <linagee> ok
[09:26:53] <duch_kazatel> linagee i've said this a few times now ;)
[09:26:57] <cannap> brb smokeing
[09:26:59] <duch_kazatel> cannap that's why - wordpress automatically uses noconflict.
[09:29:03] <BinaryKitten> yep
[09:29:23] <BinaryKitten> which is why you should do jQuery(function($) { }); for your document ready
[09:29:40] <duch_kazatel> BinaryKitten that's another way to do it.
[09:29:56] <duch_kazatel> i usually use (function($) { /* your code here */ })(jQuery);
[09:30:00] <duch_kazatel> does the same thing.
[09:30:06] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel not really
[09:30:20] <BinaryKitten> yours is a wrapper
[09:30:41] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[09:30:55] <BinaryKitten> which means you'll  end up doing  (function($) { $(function() { /** doc.ready here **/}); })(jQuery);
[09:30:55] <duch_kazatel> is there a functional difference i'm not aware of?
[09:31:04] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:31:09] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't to.
[09:31:18] <BinaryKitten> your's isn't a document ready handler
[09:31:32] <BinaryKitten> it's an IIFE that translates jQuery -> $
[09:31:35] <BinaryKitten> but nothing more
[09:31:43] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't sound right to me.
[09:32:05] <BinaryKitten> how so?
[09:32:08] <duch_kazatel> sec.
[09:34:15] <jakk89> ohh now it seems to be .done.  .fail
[09:34:23] <jakk89> havent seen the released noted
[09:34:30] <cannap> ahh
[09:38:34] <duch_kazatel> BinaryKitten i guess i was wrong!
[09:38:56] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel it's one of the small gotchas that i've dealt with
[09:39:17] <BinaryKitten> especially with Wordpress where you can't move the scripts to the footer
[09:39:23] <duch_kazatel> i always thought that somehow magically ran on document ready.
[09:39:45] <BinaryKitten> usually i use the IIFE with a few more arguments
[09:40:19] <BinaryKitten> (function($, w, undefined) { /**   **/ })(jQuery, window);
[09:40:47] <duch_kazatel> we use that iife all the time in one of our codebases because we have jquery coexisting with mootools.
[09:41:08] <BinaryKitten> ouch
[09:41:13] <duch_kazatel> thankfully i'm killing that off right now.
[09:41:19] <BinaryKitten> mootools?
[09:41:32] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[09:41:45] <BinaryKitten> i had a co-worker who hated that jQuery always "gave you an array"
[09:42:00] <BinaryKitten> they loved MooTools
[09:42:25] <duch_kazatel> i've heard a few people complain about that.  i'd rather that then use a library that adds (imo) useless methods to prototypes
[09:42:41] <BinaryKitten> yep.
[09:42:51] <BinaryKitten> if you don't need jQuery, don't call it
[09:42:58] <BinaryKitten> it's not going to affect any other JS
[09:43:04] <duch_kazatel> exactly.  mootools is too invasive imo.
[09:43:54] <decx> who still uses that anyway nowadays?
[09:43:57] <decx> besides jsfiddle
[09:44:10] <decx> which was made when using mootools was still en vogue
[09:44:26] <decx> some kind of proto contrarian hipster
[09:44:48] <duch_kazatel> decx lots of folks.  they just released a new version even.
[09:45:24] <decx> well i guess a jquery monoculture wouldnt help anyone
[09:46:24] <tiblock> Hi. If .height() tooks 10ms+ then i do something wrong or jquery?
[09:46:42] <duch_kazatel> tiblock needs more context.
[09:46:44] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ tiblock
[09:46:44] <b-ot> tiblock: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:47:38] <duch_kazatel> decx sure, but plugins shouldn't munge with prototypes imo.
[09:47:54] <duch_kazatel> especially when it's with method names like .test()
[09:48:15] <decx> i forgot everything about it but that doesnt sound right
[09:48:24] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, http://jsbin.com/ziqixunu/1/
[09:49:05] <duch_kazatel> decx they add a method to strings so you can to str.test(pattern, flags), instead of /pattern/flags.test(str);
[09:49:06] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, its for hiding big comments
[09:50:18] <duch_kazatel> why do you need an .each(), tiblock ?
[09:50:36] <duch_kazatel> turn your logic inside out.
[09:50:40] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, how i should do it?
[09:51:14] <duch_kazatel> bind a click handler to your elements that runs this logic instead.
[09:51:28] <BinaryKitten> I taught someone instead of using $.each(object   to check fo a key.. just use object.hasOwnProperty  .. half hour later the app was 3x more performant
[09:51:50] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, this code executes on page load and hides big comments and maked buttons "show full comment"
[09:52:09] <duch_kazatel> tiblock move the event handler logic out of there first.
[09:52:55] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, problem not in events (which is only click) problem is in .height tooks up to 12ms to execute for every comment
[09:53:04] <duch_kazatel> tiblock basically, start by reducing your logic down first.
[09:53:37] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, i replace height=500 and time go down from 120ms to 1ms
[09:53:56] <tiblock> *12
[09:54:12] <decx> how complex is the .post-message element?
[09:54:54] <duch_kazatel> minimize the impact of that lookup.  see if that doesn't reduce your pain point.  next you should look into using outer height if possible.
[09:55:14] <tiblock> decx, well it have about 30 elements in it
[09:55:23] <tiblock> is that reason?
[09:55:46] <decx> the more complex an element the longer it takes to compute so i guess
[09:55:59] <duch_kazatel> try outer height
[09:56:26] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, no, same time
[09:56:43] <duch_kazatel> are you using border-box?
[09:57:09] <duch_kazatel> i'd see if you can't use .css('width') instead.
[09:57:18] <tiblock> if i do comment[0].height it becomes <1ms again. Seems problem inside jquery
[09:57:35] <duch_kazatel> tiblock http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12269
[09:57:53] <duch_kazatel> this is one of those cases where you need to tackle it from a few different angles.

[10:01:17] <duch_kazatel> Edvard .live() was killed
[10:01:19] <decx> juslintek if you want crossbrowser without hassle use $(window).scrollTop() instead
[10:01:20] <duch_kazatel> use .on()
[10:01:49] <juslintek> duch_kazatel if (window.pageYOffset >= ){ is closing before else
[10:01:53] <duch_kazatel> Edvard $('parent').on('event', 'element', function() {});
[10:02:04] <duch_kazatel> juslintek  if (window.pageYOffset >= ) isn't valid.
[10:02:31] <duch_kazatel> that says "if window.pageYOffset is greater than or equal to"
[10:02:35] <duch_kazatel> greater than or equal to what?
[10:02:45] <duch_kazatel> you have to compare it to something.
[10:02:54] <decx> how smart are you? 7!
[10:03:20] <juslintek> duch_kazatel oh yea, well spotted, php isn't printing value...

[10:06:54] <duch_kazatel> wait really?
[10:07:03] <decx> yes
[10:07:07] <duch_kazatel> that's a really old macro stateside.
[10:07:13] <decx> harald schmidt
[10:07:26] <BillCriswell> I have never seen that.
[10:07:39] <duch_kazatel> really?!  used to be really popular on 4chan
[10:07:44] <decx> it's a westcoast thang
[10:08:55] <BillCriswell> The success of memes is so weird to me.
[10:09:16] <BillCriswell> The success of most shit is weird to me... besides cell phones.
[10:09:26] <duch_kazatel> memetics are really fascinating in general.
[10:09:29] <MusicFan> so... is it possible, using only javascript (no php), get html content from a website on another server (cross-domain)?
[10:09:36] <MusicFan> *to get
[10:09:55] <duch_kazatel> MusicFan if the other server allows CORS, yes
[10:10:02] <MusicFan> and if not ?
[10:10:08] <duch_kazatel> no
[10:10:11] <BinaryKitten> MusicFan yes, it's possible but not easy and not without the other party being involved
[10:10:32] <BillCriswell> MusicFan: Why can't you use php or something and write a simple proxy jawn?
[10:10:54] <duch_kazatel> MusicFan what are you trying to do?
[10:10:57] <MusicFan> well, it looks like i am forced to use php : /
[10:11:08] <duch_kazatel> well, actually.
[10:11:12] <duch_kazatel> you could use Node.js
[10:11:15] <duch_kazatel> whcih is javascript.
[10:11:17] <BinaryKitten> php/asp/node/perl/python
[10:11:24] <BillCriswell> Nothing front-end, though.
[10:11:27] <duch_kazatel> or any number of other server-side options.
[10:11:29] <rina> why is GA so complicated?
[10:11:35] <BinaryKitten> rina?
[10:11:37] <BinaryKitten> GA?
[10:11:39] <BillCriswell> rina: Google Analytics?
[10:11:40] <duch_kazatel> google analytics?
[10:11:42] <rina> yes
[10:11:43] <duch_kazatel> JINX
[10:11:49] <BillCriswell> 123 you owe me a coke.
[10:11:52] <duch_kazatel> and lol it's not - omniture is complicated
[10:12:06] <rina> I cant get it to track anything :(
[10:12:30] <duch_kazatel> it should be a drop and go deal.
[10:12:36] <MusicFan> node.js runs only in chrome ?
[10:12:41] <duch_kazatel> MusicFan no.
[10:12:52] <duch_kazatel> node.js is a way to run javascript out of the browser.
[10:13:04] <BillCriswell> You need the server side to do it.
[10:13:16] <MusicFan> well thats the problem
[10:13:27] <MusicFan> i cant do anything to/with/on the server
[10:13:42] <duch_kazatel> i thought you said you were going to write PHP?
[10:13:43] <BillCriswell> MusicFan: Is it html or json or what?
[10:13:54] <MusicFan> imagine a simple html page, i want that html data.
[10:13:55] <duch_kazatel> MusicFan what's the other site you're tyring to access?
[10:14:06] <duch_kazatel> MusicFan if they don't allow CORS, you're SOL.
[10:14:16] <MusicFan> the server on which that said html page is hosted, is not under my control
[10:14:45] <duch_kazatel> do they have an api you can tap into?
[10:14:49] <MusicFan> nope
[10:15:00] <duch_kazatel> then you're hosed without your own server-side setup.
[10:15:04] <duch_kazatel> PHP or otherwise.
[10:15:21] <BillCriswell> Just use php and get it over with. <?php echo file_get_contents(url);
[10:15:31] <MusicFan> well i can setup a server and run php on it, parse the page with php etc... but yeah.... i wanted to avoid php
[10:15:42] <duch_kazatel> MusicFan why?
[10:16:03] <duch_kazatel> and if PHP is the issue, why not use one of the dozens of other options available to you?
[10:16:17] <MusicFan> other options like ?
[10:16:48] <duch_kazatel> node.js, python, scala, .net, ruby on rails...
[10:16:58] <duch_kazatel> tons of choices for server-side work these dayus.
[10:17:08] <duch_kazatel> node.js will let you write javascript and run that on the server.
[10:17:32] <MusicFan> well these are new to me... i kinda hoped i could do it with plain javascript / jquery
[10:17:46] <duch_kazatel> in the browser, you mean.\
[10:18:06] <MusicFan> in the browser, yes
[10:18:07] <duch_kazatel> and you can do it all with javascript, but you cannot access another site via in-browser js unless they explicitly allow it.
[10:18:14] <BillCriswell> MusicFan: If I knew you were logged into gmail and visited mysite and I was able to grab html from gmail... it would be pretty bad.
[10:18:36] <donni> hi
[10:18:40] <MusicFan> i know why it isnt allowed, but ... well there is always a way : D
[10:18:44] <duch_kazatel> mushroomed
[10:18:54] <duch_kazatel> err, MusicFan you just had it explained to you.
[10:18:55] <donni> anyone can help a simple question?
[10:18:57] <duch_kazatel> there is no way around it.
[10:19:01] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ donmatth1w
[10:19:01] <b-ot> donmatth1w: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:19:05] <duch_kazatel> err, donni
[10:19:09] <duch_kazatel> dammit i give up.
[10:19:12] <MusicFan> jup, and im thankful for all your answers : )
[10:19:38] <decx> duch_kazatel i've written a book on memetics http://i.imgur.com/ZsHkWaO.png
[10:19:48] <BillCriswell> I bet it's terrible.
[10:20:03] <duch_kazatel> MusicFan whats your end goal?  what are you building?
[10:20:45] <MusicFan> short: i want to grab text from another site and display it on another site
[10:20:57] <duch_kazatel> MusicFan to what end?  what are you building?
[10:21:01] <duch_kazatel> or are you just trying to learn?
[10:21:14] <MusicFan> im trying to build a pathfinder character sheet
[10:21:47] <duch_kazatel> and you want to pull data from another site to populate that?
[10:21:52] <MusicFan> kinda, yes
[10:21:58] <duch_kazatel> then you want a server-side anyway :)
[10:22:02] <donni> in this case i have 3 text field that empty then 1 text field to show the calculation ex. <input type="text" name="val1"> <input type="text" name="val2"> <input type="text" name="val3"> , how to calculate it in realtime then shows it on <input type="text" name="val4"> when the mouseup from any field?
[10:22:37] <MusicFan> well i could just run that page in my browser, without any server involved if i only use javascript/html
[10:22:53] <MusicFan> expect the server i pull the informations from
[10:22:58] <duch_kazatel> MusicFan excecpt that you cannot use only js/html in your case.
[10:23:03] <MusicFan> yup
[10:23:30] <duch_kazatel> donni why on mouseup?
[10:23:46] <duch_kazatel> donni could it be on keypress/keydown/change?
[10:23:47] <donni> so it will automatically calculating
[10:24:00] <donni> it's okay on change
[10:24:02] <MusicFan> well, i could grab a raspberry pi and set up lampp : )
[10:24:17] <duch_kazatel> MusicFan or use heroku for free ;)
[10:24:19] <donni> how to it duch_kazatel
[10:24:25] <duch_kazatel> donni let me setup a fiddle.
[10:24:37] <donni> thank you :)
[10:25:02] <duch_kazatel> donni to clarify: http://jsfiddle.net/UWJRL/
[10:25:16] <donni> clarifying..
[10:25:29] <duch_kazatel> what are you calculating?  adding the first three together?
[10:25:52] <donni> where is the script? -_-
[10:26:05] <duch_kazatel> donni i can't write it because i need to know what you need.
[10:26:27] <donni> wait i'm going to calculate the val1 to val3 when the value is changed
[10:26:38] <donni> then shows it on val4
[10:26:38] <duch_kazatel> wat
[10:26:41] <duch_kazatel> what are you calculating?
[10:27:07] <donni> a number on val1, val2, and val3 when its filled up
[10:27:18] <duch_kazatel> are you adding those three numbers?
[10:27:49] <donni> i mean, the numbers can be anything
[10:28:07] <donni> its calculated when the user fillinf up the field
[10:28:08] <duch_kazatel> define "calculate"
[10:28:49] <donni> calculating the va1,val2 and val3 --> val1+val2+val3
[10:29:04] <duch_kazatel> okay, so you want to add 1, 2, and 3.  simple.  sec.
[10:30:01] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/UWJRL/1/
[10:30:03] <duch_kazatel> easy.
[10:30:35] <decx> i'm going to predict that adding 1 2 and 3 will always amount to 6
[10:31:21] <duch_kazatel> if you don't want it to display NaN before all three are filled, you could use a conditional on those three number vars so set them to 0 if there is no number for that input.
[10:31:23] <BillCriswell> return 6
[10:31:25] <donni> how to make it keep calculating while one of three field is empty?
[10:31:32] <duch_kazatel> donni just explained that
[10:31:36] <duch_kazatel> `mdn conditional
[10:31:37] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Conditional (ternary) Operator - JavaScript - Mozilla Developer ... â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[10:31:40] <duch_kazatel> check that out.
[10:32:05] <donni> checking out..thanks duch_kazatel
[10:32:19] <decx> BillCriswell // chosen by a fair dice roll // guaranteed to be random
[10:32:58] <decx> just add | 0 after your parseint
[10:33:23] <decx> then it's either the number you entered or 0
[10:33:33] <duch_kazatel> that's another way to do it.
[10:33:37] <BillCriswell> When woudl a dice roll not be fair?
[10:33:44] <BillCriswell> Oh, guess if they like.. slide it.
[10:33:46] <duch_kazatel> when the dice are loaded.
[10:33:51] <decx> BillCriswell http://xkcd.com/221/
[10:33:55] <donni> or just set up the value to 0 ?
[10:33:58] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha I know that one.
[10:34:05] <donni> for default
[10:34:06] <decx> oh well ^^
[10:34:09] <duch_kazatel> donni you could default the values, too.
[10:34:38] <donni> yeah that's it, thank you duch_kazatel :)
[10:34:45] <jphase> $('option[value]') should select only options with values no?
[10:35:55] <decx> value="" would be in there as well
[10:36:04] <duch_kazatel> prolly, but why would you have options that don't have a value attr?
[10:36:27] <jphase> you know, like a <option>Select an option</option> type of option hehe
[10:36:46] <tiblock> just for the record. I foud that .height() tooks 10+ms only if i launch it onDOMready. If i launc it later then it take less than 1ms
[10:37:24] <duch_kazatel> tiblock then your timer was wrong...
[10:37:46] <duch_kazatel> jphase why not use an optgroup for that instead, then?
[10:38:04] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, its kinda logical. Page is rendering and it wait until it will finish
[10:38:51] <duch_kazatel> tiblock you were blaming jquery when it's browser rendering that's the culprit.  sounds like your benchmark was flawed.
[10:39:15] <duch_kazatel> jphase you could also use disabled to prevent selection of those.
[10:39:34] <jphase> ah that's a good point
[10:39:44] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, wana me show it to you in provate message?
[10:39:48] <tiblock> *private
[10:40:08] <duch_kazatel> tiblock just share it here.
[10:40:23] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, it will be ads of website
[10:40:48] <duch_kazatel> tiblock huh?  if you can share it with me, you can share it with everybody.
[10:40:55] <duch_kazatel> and i'm talking about your benchmark.
[10:41:00] <duch_kazatel> not your site.
[10:41:04] <decx> share the load ***
[10:42:16] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, okay, go here http://2ch.hk/test/ and look down on benchmark area, there is "Ñêðûòèå äëèííûõ ÎÏ-ïîñòîâ" thats is that code. Then open console and do it again http://pastebin.com/Dxe4CWEc and you will see that is will take lot times less time
[10:42:43] <duch_kazatel> tiblock that's... not what i asked for.
[10:42:56] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, uhm... what you asked?
[10:43:04] <duch_kazatel> the code you're using for your benchmark.

[10:43:49] <blakespot> greetings
[10:44:07] <blakespot> I am dragging divs around my browser using jQuery draggable functionality
[10:44:24] <duch_kazatel> tiblock why not use console.time() and console.timeEnd() instead?
[10:44:28] <blakespot> For many this would be enough but no I want more.
[10:44:48] <duch_kazatel> and put those right before and right after your .height() calculation.
[10:44:54] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, its same function and same code for onDOMready and after and they give different times
[10:45:09] <duch_kazatel> tiblock your benchmark is flawed, but whatever someslice.
[10:45:18] <duch_kazatel> *homesl
[10:47:02] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, console.time(); and console.timeEnd(); doesnt output anything
[10:47:10] <blakespot> I have a grid of images (each in its own small div) making the background over which I am dragging these divs with jQuery draggable
[10:47:19] <duch_kazatel> console.time('timerName'); console.timeEnd('timerName');
[10:47:36] <blakespot> I Want to swap other images in or change opacity of the background divs as the draggable divs move over them
[10:47:43] <blakespot> Is there a hook for this?
[10:47:58] <blakespot> to know if a certain div is partially obscuring another div?
[10:48:55] <decx> use a rectangle collision detection
[10:49:25] <decx> or just a bunch of droppable areas
[10:50:06] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, is that good for you? http://i.imgur.com/ORrGbSj.png
[10:50:33] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, first waits for render page done
[10:50:35] <blakespot> droppable areas?
[10:50:42] <decx> use console.time('name') console.timeEnd('name') instead
[10:51:03] <duch_kazatel> tiblock now you're actually measuring what you intend to measure ;)
[10:51:17] <decx> oh you do
[10:51:23] <decx> just saw the 50 bmarks ^^
[10:51:38] <duch_kazatel> tiblock it's slower on that first iteration, yes.  but see how fast the others are?
[10:51:55] <tiblock> ya, lets skip first 3
[10:52:34] <duch_kazatel> like i said earlier, you can minimize the impact of things like that if you move your other code out of that handler.
[10:52:51] <duch_kazatel> you'll also have more modular code that way.
[10:54:14] <Edvard> hi

[10:54:28] * Velveeta puts on a Hedonism-bot costume and crabwalks into the room, eating some grapes.
[10:54:31] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, and now i will setTimeout 1000
[10:54:39] <duch_kazatel> tiblock wut
[10:54:49] <duch_kazatel> you're not proving anything to me right now btw.
[10:54:50] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[10:54:53] <tiblock> duch_kazatel, same 62ms for rendering
[10:54:54] <Edvard> again*, reverting back to basics: unable to load photoswipe: http://jsfiddle.net/aD3Cb/132/
[10:55:01] <duch_kazatel> for the first one, tiblock
[10:55:01] <tiblock> i do, you dont belive this is rendering
[10:55:07] <duch_kazatel> tiblock i don't?
[10:55:12] <tiblock> do you?
[10:55:18] <duch_kazatel> lol
[10:55:25] <duch_kazatel> you're making some assumptions there budday.
[10:55:27] <tiblock> oh well, misuderstood you lol
[10:55:28] <Edvard> gone all tits up
[10:55:35] <Edvard> cant figure out what am doing wrong
[10:55:46] <duch_kazatel> Edvard you're not in a document ready.
[10:56:06] <Edvard> this 1 pls: http://jsfiddle.net/aD3Cb/133/
[10:56:12] <Rejected> is there a better way to find out if a certain element is a checkbox other than this: $(this).is("checkbox")?
[10:56:47] <Velveeta> rejected: is that supposed to have a colon? $(this).is(':checkbox') ?
[10:57:10] <Velveeta> because the only other way i can think of to check for that would be $(this).is('input[type="checkbox"]')
[10:58:01] <Edvard> so i must add the $(document).ready ?
[10:58:13] <Edvard> :s i was advised to stop using them by someone
[10:58:16] <Velveeta> edvard: if you want it to work right, yes..
[10:58:17] <Rejected> isn't the colon for states only? Maybe I got confused while looking at the API documentation :s
[10:58:25] <duch_kazatel> Edvard by whom?
[10:58:27] <Velveeta> i don't know who advised you of that, but i would advise not listening to them
[10:58:29] <Rejected> like ':checked', for instance
[10:58:30] <decx> that photoswipe thing uses live()
[10:58:43] <duch_kazatel> also, something tells me that plugin is old.
[10:58:53] <Edvard> is there another photo plugin that is advvised?
[10:58:55] <Velveeta> rejected: if you just put "checkbox" as your selector, it's gonna be interpreted as a tag with the actual name checkbox, as in <checkbox></checkbox>
[10:59:02] <duch_kazatel> "photo plugin"?
[10:59:13] <Edvard> image gallery plugim
[10:59:15] <Edvard> plugin
[10:59:20] <Rejected> I see. Thanks for clearing that up, Velveeta.
[10:59:27] <Velveeta> jquery provides a :checkbox selector that targets input[type="checkbox"]
[10:59:28] <Edvard> if thats the term
[10:59:35] <Rejected> hum.. nice
[10:59:49] <decx> a bunch of divs with images in a jquery mobile page will do
[11:00:08] <duch_kazatel> Edvard you don't need anything special to show pictures.
[11:00:32] <Edvard> am trying to make it so when clicked on an image, the image loads in full view and you can slide left and right to next
[11:00:37] <Edvard> what is the term for this>
[11:00:38] <Edvard> ?
[11:01:10] <BillCriswell> Blah.
[11:01:16] <earthian> Hello, my customer is using either Internet Explorer 8 or Opera 9.x. However it seems that jQuery 1.9.1 which I have used with my website is completely broken on Opera. Is there information somewhere showing which version of jQuery is best supported by Opera 9.x?
[11:01:20] <Velveeta> you could just use something like lightbox for that
[11:01:29] <duch_kazatel> or a gallery.
[11:01:35] <Edvard> lightbox thats the one
[11:01:44] <duch_kazatel> earthian http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[11:01:47] <BillCriswell> My brain needs to decide if I'm using img or image from now on. I always have some stupid issue because of it.
[11:01:53] <Velveeta> earthian: if you can be more specific about what "completely broken" means?
[11:01:56] <Edvard> using jquerymobile btw
[11:02:16] <Velveeta> i don't think there's gonna be a conclusive "best supported by Opera 9.x" version
[11:02:37] <duch_kazatel> earthian opera 9.x is very old - you're being asked to support a browser that's 8 years old.
[11:02:53] <duch_kazatel> ask them if you should support IE 7, as well ;)
[11:03:07] <earthian> Velveeta, it does not load at all.. some type mismatch errors which result in jQuery and $ being undefined.
[11:03:26] <earthian> duch_kazatel, I would not dare to ask.. they might say "Yes"! :P
[11:03:50] <duch_kazatel> i would venture a guess to say that there are hardly any users on opera 9.
[11:03:54] <duch_kazatel> and advise them to update.
[11:04:05] <systemfault> s/9//
[11:04:07] <systemfault> :P
[11:04:10] <duch_kazatel> unless they have a very compelling reason other than "I'm using it"
[11:04:11] <decx> colon is just for anything pseudo
[11:04:20] <decx> damnit scrolled up
[11:04:46] <decx> there you go, guy who asked about the colon in :checked like an hour ago
[11:04:58] <earthian> They can't upgrade - their PCs are locked down by some corporate IT "security" policy, etc.... looks like I am cornered at the moment and should concentrate on IE8 as it is better than Opera9 apparently..
[11:05:25] <earthian> anyway thanks for quick answers. ;)
[11:05:41] <Velveeta> systemfault: lol
[11:05:52] <duch_kazatel> earthian is this site intended for some kind of intranet deal, or for the internet at large?
[11:06:24] <Velveeta> earthian: it'd be easier to try to figure out the culprit if we could see the actual errors being thrown also
[11:06:39] <Edvard> is this lightbox a plugin for jquerymobile? trying to keep code to minimal
[11:06:58] <earthian> well.. it is available on the Internet but also customer-oriented, so not very public.
[11:07:08] <duch_kazatel> Edvard if you want minimal, roll your own.
[11:07:25] <earthian> I have this dream that they would suddently upgrade to a proper browser and all my problems will be gone without me doing anything... :/
[11:07:43] <Edvard> may need a compromise, lightbox plugin
[11:07:50] <duch_kazatel> earthian let me rephrase - is the client the only intended audience here?
[11:08:13] <duch_kazatel> Edvard then start searching around.
[11:08:32] <Edvard> in process :)
[11:09:12] <decx> jqm minimal huehuehue
[11:09:54] <duch_kazatel> yeah that's kind of an oxymoron.
[11:10:34] <donni> number1 = parseInt($input1.val(), 10),   <-- what is the 10 means?
[11:10:40] <duch_kazatel> radix.

[11:19:26] <Velveeta> hooray for MS keyboard hooked up to my mac
[11:23:28] <BillCriswell> Apple keyboards have always been my favorite. Using my windows one at work stinks.
[11:23:51] <duch_kazatel> the chiclet ones are funky imo.
[11:24:06] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Not sure which ones you mean.
[11:24:15] <duch_kazatel> the flat apple ones
[11:24:22] <duch_kazatel> like on their laptops.
[11:24:41] <BillCriswell> Oh, I love them.
[11:25:48] <decx> hate it
[11:26:15] <decx> my keys must have the height and weight of a mountain
[11:26:28] <BillCriswell> Hahaha.
[11:26:37] <duch_kazatel> WORD
[11:26:38] <decx> it's the only workout i get nowadays
[11:27:27] <BillCriswell> I started working out recently. It's not nearly as terrible as I was expecting it to be.
[11:28:13] <decx> i have a gym down the street, there is no excuse for me. but still ... lazy...
[11:28:57] <BillCriswell> decx: I do too, but my girlfriend prefers the gym that's a 20 minutes drive for some fucking reason.
[11:29:14] <BillCriswell> I go down the street when she's not with me, the other one when she is.
[11:29:20] <Velveeta> decx: +1 i like that clickety-clack i get with a real keyboard :D
[11:29:33] <BillCriswell> I hate noises.
[11:29:42] <BillCriswell> My keyboard is damn near silent.
[11:30:17] <Velveeta> i was working out pretty regularly from the beginning of the year, and dropped about 40 lbs up through last month.. then i went on vacation and pulled something in my calf, and it's just now getting to the point of being healed enough for me to get back to it, and i've put back almost 10 of those lbs i lost
[11:30:34] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta still 30lbs down from where you were :)
[11:30:45] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that's no easy task.
[11:30:45] <Velveeta> yepyep
[11:30:47] <duch_kazatel> i did 60lbs a few years ago.
[11:30:58] <duch_kazatel> just keep at it.  it's totally worth it.
[11:31:14] <BillCriswell> I was 280 3 weeks ago, 265 today.
[11:31:19] <Velveeta> i could probably go to a bar and pull in a solid 3 at this point, if i weren't already married... just wait till i lose some more, i'll be up to 5's, and then the wife had better watch out
[11:32:03] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta hahahahaha
[11:32:24] <BillCriswell> I just don't want to be unhealthy haha
[11:32:35] <Velveeta> i don't mind being unhealthy, but i'm tired of being fat :D
[11:32:54] <Velveeta> and i'm not like morbidly obese or anything, but i sure would like to be back to where i was 10 years ago
[11:33:45] <BillCriswell> I've always been fat haha
[11:34:06] <BillCriswell> I'd like to look the same, but just replace the fat parts with muscle.
[11:34:08] <Velveeta> i'm right about where you are now bill, this morning i was like 264.8
[11:34:13] <Velveeta> and 6'2
[11:34:20] <decx> just building up mass bro
[11:34:21] <BillCriswell> I'm only 6.
[11:34:22] <Velveeta> so i'm fat, but i'm not like fat albert fat
[11:34:54] <Velveeta> yeah, i like to think the bulk of my weight is a crapload of muscle under a very thin layer of soft stuff
[11:35:03] <hlvwrk> sup guys. how would you go about checking if an input value is greater than a value with decimals? (so if input.val() > .002, than
[11:35:14] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I could take my shirt off in public without feeling like I was ruining everyones day.
[11:35:26] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Haha, same
[11:35:32] <duch_kazatel> if (parseFloat(input.val(), 10) > .002) {}
[11:35:37] <duch_kazatel> hlvwrk but math in js is always shaky.
[11:35:44] <hlvwrk> eekk i know ;[
[11:35:46] <Velveeta> parseFloat doesn't take a radix argument does it?
[11:35:47] <hlvwrk> that should work
[11:35:55] <hlvwrk> why the , 10?
[11:36:06] <duch_kazatel> oh, nvm , no second arg.
[11:36:14] <duch_kazatel> i always get that signature confused with parseint.
[11:36:20] <Velveeta> rightio
[11:36:28] <duch_kazatel> and assume they're they same because consistency.
[11:36:31] <hlvwrk> so what would it end up being?
[11:36:37] <Velveeta> i'm currently doing a code audit of one of our products, and was just having that discussion with myself this morning
[11:36:39] <BillCriswell> I always liked +input.val()
[11:37:01] <hlvwrk> ._.
[11:37:05] <Velveeta> as i saw them using radixes on all of their parseInt calls, good job guys, and not on their parseFloat calls, also good job guys, but i had to wonder, can you write decimal values in other number bases?
[11:37:08] <decx> -0 ^^
[11:37:21] <Velveeta> like could you have an octal 234.234?
[11:37:32] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta it's to avoid the preceding 0 problem.
[11:41:52] <uskerine> Hi! How can .load method be applied to an <input> element?
[11:42:29] <uskerine> It works with <textarea>, but it does not with <input>
[11:42:51] <Velveeta> what exactly are you trying to do?
[11:42:56] <BillCriswell> That's itneresting.
[11:43:26] <decx> isnt load() only for things that have a src?
[11:43:37] <Bloomberg> Hello
[11:43:39] <Velveeta> i thought so, like images
[11:43:46] <duch_kazatel> i think he means http://api.jquery.com/load/
[11:43:59] <duch_kazatel> load content into an input maybe?
[11:44:04] <Velveeta> oh ok, maybe
[11:44:16] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/uSah8/
[11:44:20] <Velveeta> because textareas have closing tags, maybe that's allowed, whereas you have to set the val of an input
[11:44:20] <uskerine> It works for <textareas> too
[11:44:24] <Bloomberg> http://sciactive.github.io/pnotify/#demos-simple
[11:44:25] <Bloomberg> guys!!
[11:44:39] <Bloomberg> when I apply the tooltip function doesn't works
[11:44:50] <decx> BillCriswell it's full calendar time !
[11:44:53] <uskerine> yeah, I mean that one
[11:44:56] <duch_kazatel> guys
[11:44:59] <BillCriswell> decx: AW SIT
[11:45:02] <Bloomberg> fullcalendar is ok
[11:45:05] <BillCriswell> guys
[11:45:13] <duch_kazatel> guys i have calendar?
[11:45:16] <Bloomberg> the thing is with pnotify
[11:45:22] <Velveeta> uskerine: i don't think you can use that with a text input.. load injects html into the target element, whereas you have to set an input's value instead
[11:45:35] <uskerine> I am using $("#myTextArea").load(...) and it works, but it does not work for $('#myInputElement').load(....)ç
[11:45:37] <decx> hey goys
[11:45:44] <Velveeta> uskerine: you should just run a standard call to $.ajax, and in your success handler, set the response as the .val() of your input
[11:45:44] <uskerine> ok
[11:45:50] <uskerine> ok
[11:45:53] <uskerine> understood, thanks
[11:45:59] <decx> ajaxing in a value?
[11:46:05] <Velveeta> right, it's weird
[11:46:16] <Velveeta> and i can't imagine how big that value has to be to merit an ajax request
[11:46:30] <Velveeta> i'm just throwing out the functional equivalent of a .load call for a text input
[11:46:38] <uskerine> why is weird?
[11:46:51] <decx> just have your backend output the value you need directly
[11:46:51] <uskerine> I have to recover the value from database
[11:47:12] <BillCriswell> uskerine: You'd probably have to do: $.get('foo.txt', function (value){ $('#myInputValue').val(value); });
[11:47:25] <BillCriswell> Er, .done() instead of the success callback.
[11:47:33] <Velveeta> uskerine: most people don't ajax values into their form fields one at a time like that, that's why it's weird
[11:47:47] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Yeah, lots of overhead there.
[11:47:55] <uskerine> It is a really unused maintenance screen
[11:47:58] <Velveeta> they'll either retrieve a form state as a whole, and assign those values to all elements at once, or else write the values out as part of the page markup during the initial load
[11:48:04] <uskerine> ok
[11:48:10] <uskerine> so your suggesting is to retrieve at once all the items
[11:48:15] <uskerine> and then assign the values to each one
[11:48:21] <uskerine> suggesstion*
[11:48:25] <Velveeta> well, we're actually suggesting just writing it out as part of the initial page load, i think
[11:48:30] <Velveeta> i mean, that's what i would recommend
[11:49:01] <Velveeta> i mean, no need to make one round trip to the server to draw the form, and another just to get its values to inject dynamically, when you can do it all in one go
[11:49:17] <BillCriswell> Is there a built in way to do like $('form').populate(listOfFieldData); ?
[11:49:41] <Velveeta> i don't think so
[11:50:00] <decx> not until you make it
[11:50:01] <Velveeta> a deserialize() plugin might be handy for something like that
[11:50:03] <BillCriswell> I think I wrote that before.. pretty lazy to look it up, though.
[11:50:10] <uskerine> well I am writting the app with pure HTML, so I need at least one intiall AJAX call, but it is true that it makes no sense to retrieve each value in a separate AJAX call
[11:50:11] <Velveeta> since there's already a form.serialize method
[11:50:16] <decx> how does it correspond?
[11:50:18] <BillCriswell> Ah, I think I remeber where it is.
[11:50:19] <decx> key to name?
[11:50:31] <uskerine> Thanks for the advice, I will group requests
[11:50:32] <Velveeta> you're writing the app with pure html........... plus ajax?
[11:50:35] <uskerine> well
[11:50:42] <uskerine> I mean, I am not using PHP or JSP
[11:50:42] <BillCriswell> decx: The one I did was [ { name: '', value: '' } ]
[11:50:47] <uskerine> so I can't load HTML+data at the same time
[11:51:04] <Velveeta> so what are you making the request to to pull your form data from a db?
[11:51:08] <Velveeta> because html doesn't do that
[11:51:16] <BillCriswell> decx: Mwhahaahha
[11:51:17] <BillCriswell> https://gist.github.com/crswll/7905125
[11:51:26] <uskerine> AJAX, plus a Java Servlets backend
[11:51:33] <decx> lean
[11:51:59] <BillCriswell> I'm sure there's tons of shit wrong with it.
[11:52:00] <Velveeta> so you're loading a static html page, with javascript embedded in it to make a request to a servlets page when it loads?
[11:52:08] <uskerine> yeah, that's it
[11:52:24] <Velveeta> i don't understand why, but ok
[11:52:48] <uskerine> well, the main load will be with datatables plugin, and for that you requiere AJAX
[11:53:15] <uskerine> only few isolated values are retrieved from AJAX calls
[11:53:18] <Velveeta> what i'm saying is i don't understand why you're making the initial page load a static html source vs just using a java endpoint of some kind
[11:53:35] <uskerine> Yeah I could apply JSP
[11:53:46] <Velveeta> i understand that for data loads after the fact, you need ajax.. i'm just not clear as to why you set up this kind of scaffolding to begin with :)
[11:54:09] <uskerine> Velveeta, probably it is because is my first web app
[11:54:15] <Velveeta> gotcha
[11:54:27] <uskerine> so I do what I know, sometimes even less than that
[11:54:31] <decx> i have a client who always wants a faster page, so we scraped all the productpages and serve them without any php overhead too cookieless users
[11:54:47] <uskerine> but I got your advices, at least grouping all request into a single AJAX, or move to JSP (which is what I know) to avoid HTML load + AJAX call
[11:54:48] <decx> from 250 to 50ms
[11:55:58] <Velveeta> i had a former employer that wanted fresh content on a weekly basis for SEO purposes, but didn't want to write something new all the time, so we had db tables to hold nothing but content in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, nth paragraph blocks
[11:56:23] <Velveeta> and once a week, we'd expire a cache, and the first page load after that would randomly select a set of paragraphs and cache them for the next week
[11:56:35] <decx> hehe, matt cutts hates him
[11:56:36] <Velveeta> and then subsequent page loads just served up from the cache
[11:56:59] <Velveeta> heheheh
[11:57:07] <Velveeta> had to google who that was, but yes, he probably does :D
[11:57:29] <decx> i should make a matt cuts tshirt with him as a dj, mad cutz
[11:57:30] <Velveeta> although these guys spend in the order of 10's of thousands of dollars on adwords campaigns per month.. they run a few thousand sites for lead generation
[11:57:40] <Velveeta> kid cutti
[11:58:41] <skinux> How do we detect if any fields of several forms have been changed since page load?
[11:58:57] <decx> there's a change event
[11:59:13] <blakespot> Looking into droppable areas
[11:59:16] <skinux> Do I need to set that event for each form??
[11:59:32] <decx> preferrably
[11:59:36] <blakespot> I have a div I can drag around with mouse and a grid of divs under it that I Want to change color of while the draggable div is over them
[11:59:41] <decx> -r
[11:59:50] <skinux> Darn. The number of forms is dependent on number of rows in database.
[12:00:09] <blakespot> droppable areas aren't workable for a moving div entering and exiting its bounds is it?
[12:00:54] <Velveeta> skinux: are you making a separate form for every record of a particular database table?
[12:01:09] <onethfour3> www.jsfiddle.net
[12:01:11] <skinux> Yes.
[12:01:14] <Velveeta> blakespot: there should be a hoverclass option you can pass to your droppables
[12:01:28] <blakespot> ah
[12:01:33] <blakespot> Droppable areas seems a good route?
[12:01:36] <blakespot> then
[12:01:36] <skinux> It's a page to update records.
[12:01:45] <Velveeta> skinux: you should just create a single form with numeric indexes on your fields, like person[23][name], person[24][name], etc
[12:02:32] <skinux> I would'nt know how to work with the post data from that.
[12:02:47] <Velveeta> what language on the back end?
[12:02:58] <Velveeta> your post data would be split up into a hash of some kind based on those indexes
[12:02:59] <skinux> PHP
[12:03:23] <Velveeta> you'd reference it like $_POST['person'][$dbIndex]['name'], with $dbIndex being 23, 24, or N
[12:03:36] <skinux> So, would I do $_POST['something'][xx]; ??
[12:03:40] <Velveeta> yep
[12:04:20] <Velveeta> if you only want to submit 1 record change at a time, you could have, say, a fieldset with an individual "form"'s worth of data, and a button element with that subform's id value, and ajax-submit just that portion of it
[12:04:26] * skinux also wishes he'd learned to use a framework for re-developing these server pages
[12:05:44] <onethfour3> Why doesn't the image appear: http://jsfiddle.net/Uw77b/
[12:07:48] <skinux> I'm not sure how to use fieldsets
[12:08:38] <onethfour3> is there somethign wrong wtih  $('<a>').attr('href','#delete').append() ?
[12:08:47] <skinux> Velveeta: On post of form, where are you getting $dbIndex from?
[12:09:06] <skinux> Not keeping track of "current item" using session are you??
[12:10:28] <Velveeta> skinux: you can either post that also, or you can iterate over your hash like this: foreach ($_POST['person'] as $dbIndex => $person) {
[12:11:04] <Velveeta> onethfour3: only in that you're not telling what to append it to
[12:11:27] <onethfour3> see my fiddle example, i am putting an image
[12:11:34] <onethfour3> but the image is not showing up
[12:11:42] <skinux> Can you give me a quick example of both a form and working with data in PHP?
[12:15:19] <decx> blakespot here's something without droppable http://jsfiddle.net/decx/fy9mZ/
[12:16:12] <skinux> Wait...I could put $dbIndex as a hidden form field
[12:16:19] <Velveeta> onethfour3: i wrapped your block in a document.ready, but the big problem is that you were using $('img') as a selector vs $('<img') http://jsfiddle.net/Uw77b/1/
[12:16:47] <onethfour3> oops thanks
[12:17:00] <Velveeta> skinux: you could do that, but if you're working with a single form for all records, and submitting them all together, you won't want to do that, i'll whip up some sample code
[12:17:38] <blakespot> Velveeta: the hoverClass is working for me
[12:18:01] <blakespot> But it's only activating when the pointer is over the background cell
[12:18:10] <blakespot> I want the area of the draggable div to act as the hover trigger
[12:18:16] <blakespot> not just the mouse pointer within it
[12:18:18] <blakespot> is that doable?
[12:18:47] <blakespot> decx: That's basically exactly what I want
[12:18:47] <decx> i just did in my example
[12:18:52] <blakespot> sweet
[12:19:26] <blakespot> thank you
[12:19:35] <decx> i'm a sucker for collision detection
[12:19:36] <decx> ^^
[12:20:43] <blakespot> nice
[12:20:56] <onethfour3> I want to write a jquery plugin which converts an <input type=text" to a huge table of hours, when I start writing my plugin, do I go through .each() of the passed in selector and make my element?
[12:21:03] <skinux> Velveeta: If all records are in a single form, then you're submitting ALL records back to server, right?
[12:21:43] <decx> onethfour3 you set up your defaults and then you return this.each(fn....)
[12:21:46] <Velveeta> skinux: something like this would work for writing out a simple form, and yes, it would submit everything back: http://jsfiddle.net/n6y5p/
[12:21:55] <Velveeta> and that's how you'd iterate over the submitted data
[12:22:10] <Velveeta> if you wanted to only submit a single record at a time, then you'd need to have something different, which i can also show an example of
[12:22:17] <onethfour3> decx, what do you mean return my this.each() ?
[12:23:14] <decx> not return my this.each
[12:23:18] <decx> return this.each
[12:23:19] <decx> ^^
[12:23:30] <skinux> Velveeta: htmlspecialchars isn't needed using PDO is it?
[12:23:32] <onethfour3> can you give me an example plugin that does that
[12:23:56] <decx> onethfour3 http://jsfiddle.net/decx/eP4dV/
[12:25:21] <onethfour3> thanks! using it now
[12:26:01] <decx> there's like 50 other ways that are probably cleaner but i find this easy to grasp for getting into it
[12:26:24] <Velveeta> skinux: something more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/n6y5p/1/
[12:26:50] <onethfour3> shouldn't the top line look like (function($){
[12:26:55] <skinux> Oh...I get it! PHP turns the multi-part element names into multi-dimensional arrays
[12:27:04] <Velveeta> you'd have a button in each fieldset, with that fieldset's id value (if you wanted to transmit that also, but not necessarily), and submit just the elements that are in that fieldset
[12:27:10] <Velveeta> skinux: yepyep
[12:27:25] <Velveeta> then you can do all of that with a single form instead of 300 or whatever
[12:27:32] <skinux> When I think of hashes, I'm always thinking of encrypted data or something like that.
[12:28:58] <skinux> That's actually pretty easy.
[12:29:22] <onethfour3> decx
[12:29:44] <onethfour3> shouldn't i put a $ inside the function() so that $ is guaranteed to be the jquery object
[12:30:21] <Velveeta> yeah, i started as a php dev, and knew those as "associative arrays".. it took me a while to figure out that's what people were referring to when they said hashes or hash tables also
[12:30:55] <onethfour3> c++ way of defining things
[12:31:01] <skinux> Why formData = {}; ??
[12:31:03] <onethfour3> and computer science in general
[12:31:03] <Velveeta> well, i started web dev as a php person, but got there from a C background, and my definition of a hash was an index lookup table to quickly find references
[12:31:04] <decx> onethfour3 oh right
[12:31:27] <Velveeta> skinux: just to create an empty object to start assigning our form values to as we iterate over our elements collection
[12:31:33] <Velveeta> and then ajax-submit just those form values
[12:31:57] <skinux> Okay, so the PHP script would need to be receiving JSON?
[12:34:02] <Velveeta> nope, it would be receiving a standard form post at the end of that
[12:34:17] <Velveeta> that object just stores key/value pairs, which jquery's ajax function converts to a standard form post format
[12:34:32] <skinux> Ohhhh....data: formData....duh
[12:34:43] * Velveeta gives a thumbs-up.
[12:36:36] <skinux> Sorry, your code should have been self explanatory. I'm kind of slow
[12:37:51] <jphase> btw, for mac users:  leafnote is free (today only) on the app store:  https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/id879371601?mt=12
[12:37:51] <Velveeta> well, jsfiddle isn't really conducive to making mixed php/js examples out of, i had to bastardize it for a readonly example :D
[12:38:17] <onethfour3> decx, how do I add methods to my class?
[12:38:22] <onethfour3> i mean my plugin
[12:38:37] <Velveeta> jphase: neato... i'm not sure i'll have a use for it yet, but can't beat the price <nab>
[12:39:24] <decx> onethfour3 http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/advanced-plugin-concepts/
[12:39:47] <jphase> inorite? worth a download if only for the investment purposes
[12:40:05] <Velveeta> rightio
[12:42:49] <jphase> hmm, I don't use $.inArray that often, does it do type comparisons or something cause it's basically saying "78 is in []" and "78 is in [1,2,3,4]"
[12:43:19] <jphase> I'm comparing a .val of an option with an array created from .split'ing a data attribute into an array of numbers
[12:43:33] * jphase creates fiddle
[12:45:03] <BillCriswell> jphase: Why not just store the array on the data attribute?
[12:45:27] <BillCriswell> jphase: Make sure you're checking > -1
[12:46:21] <hlvwrk> is there a better way to do this conversion (faster, or more functional?) http://jsfiddle.net/YEP6Y/
[12:46:22] <jphase> BillCriswell: like as a JSON object or?
[12:46:53] <jphase> as of now I'm spitting out the results of a GROUP_CONCAT(ID SEPARATOR " ") directly into the data attribute
[12:47:13] <jphase> then using .split(' ') to create an array from it
[12:47:16] <BillCriswell> jphase: Oh ok. Nevermind. Let me set up a fiddle haha.
[12:49:03] <jphase> hmm, works on my fiddle lol
[12:49:10] <jphase> fee fi fo fum
[12:49:46] <jphase> oh, you're right on the -1
[12:49:58] <jphase> I was thinking I could just do if($.inArray(blah, array)) {
[12:50:00] <BillCriswell> It's a strict comparison.
[12:50:03] <jphase> gotcha
[12:50:07] <jphase> thx buddy
[12:50:22] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[12:50:26] <Velveeta> jphase: when you store that group_concate, separate em by commas, and wrap em in [], and let jquery typecast that to an array for you
[12:50:41] <blakespot> decx: My background grid scales...that makes your hover / grid approach impossible, no?
[12:50:44] <jphase> oh okay
[12:50:46] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: Oh it will do that.
[12:51:22] <Velveeta> if you store it in a json syntax as a data attribute, the data() function will coerce it to its best guess, yes, whether that's String, Number, Object/Array, or Boolean
[12:51:25] <BillCriswell> jphase: http://jsbin.com/karayodu/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:51:37] <Velveeta> like data-something="true", and .data('something') will be a Boolean true
[12:52:02] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I was thinking that from the start but had a brain fart.
[12:52:06] <jphase> that's my issue, and here I was doing extra work for nothing :\
[12:52:08] <Velveeta> heheheh
[12:53:33] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: I used data-foo='{"json":true}' the other day. I hated using the single quotes though haha
[12:54:12] <jphase> bleh, I have the same issues looking at single quoted attribs
[12:54:23] <jphase> that's literally the only use for them imo
[12:54:29] <decx> blakespot mom
[12:54:51] <Velveeta> yepyep, i feel the same way :D
[12:55:27] <blakespot> decx: I DM'ed you fyi/fwiw
[12:55:54] <Velveeta> i just took this text from one of our angular proponents here at work: "Yeah, Chris just stole the words out of my mouth. I would never ever try to push Angular 1.x as a common platform. Angular 2 is more of a set of ES6 components based around a small Angular core. More like if Backbone had a bunch of extra classes build by the Backbone team that you could add in to your project, but would work together off a common core like jQueryUI widget
[12:55:54] <Velveeta> s."
[12:56:09] <Velveeta> and re-sent it out as this quote: "I would never ever try to push â€¦ components based around â€¦ Angular â€¦ Backbone â€¦ could add â€¦ to your project â€¦ like jQueryUI widgets."
[12:57:36] <jphase> Velveeta: for some reason it didn't typecast it into an array for me? I used .split(',') and it worked fine but wondering if I did something silly?
[12:57:57] <Velveeta> jphase what's the actual attribute value?
[12:58:03] <jphase> <option data-user="16" data-teams="44,256,264,137" value="14">Jeff Hays</option>
[12:58:24] <jphase> hehe, feels weird to paste my actual name in here for some reason :\
[12:58:40] <BillCriswell> jphase: Your usename is really clever haha
[12:58:54] <BillCriswell> jphase: You need the [ and ].
[12:58:59] <jphase> BillCriswell: hah!! you get it!! you're the first I haven't had to explain
[12:58:59] <jphase> oh duh
[12:59:01] <jphase> gotcha
[12:59:05] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/karayodu/2/edit like in this demo.
[12:59:25] <decx> blakespot http://jsfiddle.net/decx/fy9mZ/2/
[12:59:26] <jphase> yeah that's my bad, been looking at this for too long and I'm running low on caffeine
[12:59:41] <onethfour3> i'm getting confused with writing this plugin, i want a function which adds a row to a table but I dont know how to determine which table it is
[13:00:29] <Velveeta> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/Ua276/
[13:01:25] <blakespot> looking
[13:01:47] <Velveeta> jphase: here we go.. just because the boolean example was a little ambiguous in the console :) http://jsfiddle.net/Ua276/1/
[13:02:18] <Velveeta> also, i don't get the cleverness of the name jphase
[13:02:26] <jphase> it's phonetic for "Jeff Hays"
[13:02:47] <blakespot> decx: Awesome! Direct hit!
[13:02:48] <Velveeta> ahhhh ok, maybe if i had know that name it would've clicked :D
[13:02:54] <nezZario> ok
[13:02:59] <Velveeta> decx: you sunk his battleshot
[13:03:01] <nezZario> well now that i've been aksing jquery in #linux on accident
[13:03:08] <Z3R0> Can anyone helpâ€¦ I'm trying to use Bootstrap's jQuery button state for loading, but whenever I click the button (following the guide) it states that I cannot call methods on a button before initialization
[13:03:11] <blakespot> thanks so much
[13:03:15] <nezZario> i was in the wrong channel .. that was pretty funny to me anyway
[13:03:25] <Velveeta> z3ro: are you instantiating it as a button first?
[13:03:31] <nezZario> ok so what's the proper way to delegate everything?  or how terrible is it really?
[13:03:42] <Z3R0> it should be a buttonâ€¦ it's an on click event and stored as var btn = $(this);
[13:03:43] <duch_kazatel> nezZario you mean events?
[13:03:57] <Velveeta> z3ro: but are you ever doing something like $(this).button() ?
[13:03:58] <Z3R0> btn.button('loading'); is all that is next...
[13:04:16] <Velveeta> you have to instantiate it as a button widget first, before trying to call those public methods
[13:04:19] <duch_kazatel> nezZario or do you have some particular example you're working against.
[13:04:22] <Z3R0> no, but it doesn't state that in the docâ€¦ that's weird...
[13:04:46] <onethfour3> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1117086/how-to-create-a-jquery-plugin-with-methods
[13:04:49] <Z3R0> no such method 'loading' for button widget instance
[13:04:54] <nezZario> yes, like on('click', document.body, '[data-foo="bar"]', function() { }) <-- is there a better way?
[13:04:58] <Velveeta> well, their docs probably don't cover a ground-up understanding of how widgets work, but it's built on jquery ui's widget factory, and you have to instantiate elements as a type of widget before dealing with them as that widget
[13:05:18] <duch_kazatel> nezZario that's not the right syntax for that.
[13:05:20] <Velveeta> are you trying to call a function called loading, or just set its state?
[13:05:31] <duch_kazatel> and i would never use data attributes as selectors.
[13:05:36] <Z3R0> the 'loading' function should be part of BS's whatever and uses a data attribute called data-loading-text...
[13:05:48] <duch_kazatel> nezZario but i wouldn't delegate /everything/, especially not on body or document.
[13:05:51] <Z3R0> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#buttons // doc
[13:06:23] <nezZario> duch_kazatel: sorry, $(document).on('click', '[data-XXX="bar"]', function() { });
[13:06:39] <Z3R0> lmfao fixed
[13:06:47] <Z3R0> apparently I was calling bootstrap.js before jquery-ui
[13:06:48] <nezZario> well i'm trying to pull something off similar to bootstrap's data-dismiss
[13:06:56] <Velveeta> ahhhh yes, jquery ui loads its own button widget
[13:07:05] <duch_kazatel> nezZario bind lower in the document if possible, and don't use data attributes as selectors.
[13:07:07] <Velveeta> so that would overwrite the $.fn.button function that bootstrap had loaded in
[13:07:09] <Z3R0> so jquery-ui overwrote it
[13:07:10] <nezZario> it seems they have something similar to this but don't use $(document)
[13:07:13] <Velveeta> yep
[13:07:25] <Z3R0> now going to see if I still need that button()
[13:07:38] <Z3R0> nopeâ€¦ ;) perfect, thanks
[13:07:41] <Velveeta> unless it autoinitializes all buttons in the page, you'll still need that
[13:07:47] <Velveeta> ok then, sounds like it has its own initializer
[13:07:49] <Z3R0> seems like it does :)
[13:07:50] <jphase> bah, what on earth, this is still not working for me - I need an idiot check:   http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/UWLVz/
[13:08:14] <jphase> sorry for the markup, it's directly from php output... the team to select is "Dirty Sneakers" to match the right ids
[13:08:48] <jphase> actually, let me add some \n or something to make this not look so bad
[13:08:48] <duch_kazatel> nezZario that's how you use a delegated listener, sure.
[13:09:03] <nezZario> oh ok, i guess I can narrow it to a class
[13:09:06] <Velveeta> jphase: can you give us a combination that should evaluate to true?
[13:09:14] <Z3R0> thanks for the help anyways man :)
[13:09:19] <jphase> Velveeta: yeah select "Dirty Sneakers" from the team list
[13:09:37] <nezZario> duch_kazatel: is it still absolutely terrible to say $('.hasListener').on and then delegate to to a data attribute ?
[13:09:58] <duch_kazatel> nezZario data attributes are not meants for selection.
[13:09:59] <duch_kazatel> ever.
[13:10:07] <Velveeta> jphase: here you go, remember, strict type check ;) http://jsfiddle.net/UWLVz/1/
[13:10:08] <nezZario> er, i'm just saying -- bootstrap does it
[13:10:09] <duch_kazatel> *selecting.  they are for storing data.
[13:10:13] <Velveeta> you need to cast that .val() to a Number()
[13:10:15] <duch_kazatel> i don't care what bootstrap does ;)
[13:10:26] <duch_kazatel> the point of data attributes is to store data.  not to be selected on.
[13:10:31] <jphase> oh for some reason I thought that was pulling in as the right type
[13:10:33] <jphase> thx!
[13:10:38] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[13:10:41] <nezZario> i guess it doesn't really matter, i can just use the class and use the data atrributes later, it doesn't matter if the data attribute is selected or not at that point
[13:10:49] <nezZario> not actually delegate on them
[13:11:01] <duch_kazatel> nezZario don't select on them ever tbh.
[13:11:20] <nezZario> duch_kazatel: yeah, i'm not, sorry, just trying to get things straight in my head
[13:11:38] <nezZario> i'm trying to write a generalized handler, but I can just apply the listener to a class and then use the data attributes as they were intended.
[13:11:43] <Velveeta> are you talking about something like $('.hasListener').on('click', '[data-something="something"]', callback) ?
[13:11:44] <duch_kazatel> nezZario either way, delegated listeners are a good thing.
[13:11:58] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta yeah, bootstrap does stuff like that.
[13:11:59] <Velveeta> yeah, use classes for event delegate listeners
[13:12:02] <Velveeta> gross
[13:12:17] <Velveeta> i have lots of problems with bootstrap's implementations
[13:12:24] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[13:13:00] <duch_kazatel> i don't like their "designated fun zone" approach, either.
[13:13:19] <Velveeta> lol, i'm not sure what that is
[13:13:30] <nezZario> now, here is where I'm confused
[13:13:54] <duch_kazatel> basically, once you start using it, it's hard to do anything in the "non bootstrap way"
[13:14:03] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha
[13:14:16] <nezZario> if I say $('.foo').on('click', '.bar', callback); ... I can have multiple foo's and bar has to be a parent of /one of those/ foo's to get the listener attached ?
[13:14:26] <Velveeta> yeah, we always give the angular guys here a lot of crap, and it's not that angular isn't hellaciously powerful for what it does, but it's so damned opinionated
[13:14:27] <duch_kazatel> other way around.
[13:14:33] <juslintek> can anyone tell me what on this: https://gist.github.com/juslintek/1929a1c7011c04d4a823 can be causing this id=s5_left_column_wrap to get pushed off the screen?
[13:14:45] <Velveeta> nezzario: you have it backwards
[13:14:49] <duch_kazatel> nezZario in your example, .foo would be the parent, .bar is the child
[13:14:53] <Velveeta> you can have multiple bars, and foo has to be a parent
[13:15:04] <nezZario> oh i'm sorry, .. yeah i knew that, it's just been a long day
[13:15:17] <Velveeta> beer helps
[13:15:40] <juslintek> http://pressline.lt/index.php/lt/component/virtuemart/derby-hat-detail?Itemid=500
[13:15:41] <nezZario> but yeah, reversed, .. does it work like that?  so it doesn't have to be a single root element?
[13:15:49] <nezZario> a 'common ancestor'
[13:16:01] <duch_kazatel> nezZario the parent element just needs to exist.
[13:16:05] <Velveeta> right
[13:16:07] <duch_kazatel> it can be any number of them.
[13:16:16] <duch_kazatel> you can select on a class just fine, as long as it exists.
[13:16:21] <duch_kazatel> there could be 0 or 500
[13:16:24] <Velveeta> yeah, if you have 3 .foo's in your document, and each one has 10 .bar's, you have 30 listeners there
[13:16:31] <Velveeta> well, 3 listeners, for 30 nodes
[13:16:38] <nezZario> ok cool
[13:16:40] <nezZario> thanks guys
[13:16:45] <nezZario> just trying to wrap my head around it =)
[13:16:55] <duch_kazatel> are you familiar with event bubbling?
[13:17:37] <Velveeta> somebody should write plugins for .no() and .ffo() that use event capturing vs bubbling, just to make the rest of the world go "wat"
[13:17:45] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[13:18:31] <systemfault> Does anyone has a practical use of capturingâ€¦ something that cannot be done as easily using bubbling
[13:18:34] <nezZario> NO i'm not
[13:18:40] <nezZario> Sorry, caps
[13:18:54] <systemfault> AFAIK, capturing was only added because the w3c didn't want netscape to cry :P
[13:18:54] <Velveeta> i have zero practical use for capturing
[13:19:09] <nezZario> I'm guessing I need to read about it? =)
[13:19:15] <duch_kazatel> nezZario http://javascript.info/tutorial/bubbling-and-capturing
[13:19:19] <Velveeta> to me, it's counterintuitive, and way too much overhead
[13:19:28] <duch_kazatel> this will help you understand why delegated listeners work.
[13:19:49] <duch_kazatel> long story short - when you click an element, that event bubbles up through the entire document.
[13:25:26] <onethfour3> I want to make table rows reorderable by drag and drop, is there anything like this http://isocra.com/2008/02/table-drag-and-drop-jquery-plugin/ only later than 2008 ?
[13:27:20] <Edvard> hi again
[13:27:33] <Edvard> could someone explained the following please: (function ($, undefined) { 'use strict';
[13:27:53] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:28:08] <duch_kazatel> the other end of that is pretty important.
[13:28:16] <Edvard> i was advised to use this
[13:28:29] <Edvard> end:   })(jQuery);
[13:28:41] <Edvard> trying to use this: http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/documentation.html
[13:29:13] <Edvard> Magnific popup
[13:29:26] <Edvard> got this working: http://jsfiddle.net/aD3Cb/143/
[13:29:35] <Edvard> but had to cut out the: (function ($, undefined) { 'use strict';
[13:29:56] <duch_kazatel> probably because it doesn't support strict mode.
[13:30:25] <Edvard> why would someone advise a noob to use that code?
[13:30:32] <Edvard> apart from to write better code
[13:30:44] <blakespot> decx: Why is
[13:31:01] <blakespot> decx: why is the section needed in the var divs?
[13:31:10] <duch_kazatel> Edvard probably to make sure you develop good habits.
[13:31:27] <Edvard> thats the good thing
[13:31:36] <Edvard> but on the down side he didnt explain what its doing
[13:31:45] <duch_kazatel> who told you to use it?
[13:31:52] <Edvard> someone in #web
[13:32:01] <Edvard> couple of days ago, i need to take note of such things
[13:32:01] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:32:06] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode
[13:32:09] <duch_kazatel> this is everything that does.
[13:33:12] <mckendricks> having trouble with a touchstart event on http://clarencecaldwell.com, can anyone help?
[13:33:38] <Edvard> i didnt mean strict mode
[13:33:53] <duch_kazatel> oh you mean the beginning of that IIFE?
[13:34:01] <Edvard> IIFE?
[13:34:06] <Edvard> (function ($, undefined) { '
[13:34:10] <mckendricks> there is a play button that should load a mejs player on touchstart, but nothing happens.
[13:34:15] <Edvard> all my code is wrapped inside that
[13:34:29] <duch_kazatel> Edvard right - that helps to make an iife.
[13:34:31] <duch_kazatel> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/iife-argument-madness/
[13:34:59] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't need to use that iife (the last line is important, too)
[13:35:00] <Edvard> what a twister
[13:35:42] <Edvard> so it wraps your code in a function
[13:36:10] <duch_kazatel> an immediately invoked function expression, more specifically.
[13:36:38] <Edvard> still reading btw
[13:36:52] <Edvard> no wonder the IIFE name
[13:37:33] <duch_kazatel> it's basically trying to protect scope and some specific objects.
[13:38:04] <Edvard> layering variables within different scopes?
[13:38:09] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:38:09] <Edvard> so they are less accessible>
[13:38:12] <duch_kazatel> there's no "layering"
[13:38:37] <Edvard> was i even close? :(
[13:38:41] <duch_kazatel> you're protecting your script's scope.
[13:38:55] <duch_kazatel> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[13:38:58] <duch_kazatel> read this and feel smart :)
[13:39:01] <Edvard> i got that but what is it in dummy speak
[13:39:14] <Edvard> already on it:P
[13:39:18] <Edvard> had to find out what IIFE meant
[13:39:40] <duch_kazatel> Immediately Invoked Function Expression - it's a function expression that runs once it's parsed.
[13:39:47] <duch_kazatel> it creates a scope for you to work in.
[13:40:26] <Edvard> do you use this?
[13:40:36] <duch_kazatel> IIFEs?
[13:41:50] <duch_kazatel> Edvard I use them all the time.
[13:42:18] <Edvard> as the site said: (function(){
[13:42:21] <Edvard> worked
[13:42:24] <Edvard> no errors
[13:42:37] <duch_kazatel> the closing side is important, too.
[13:42:42] <Edvard> this feels different from what i learnt in the jquery docs and tutorials
[13:42:46] <Edvard> got that :)
[13:42:56] <Edvard> what does it mean
[13:42:57] <duch_kazatel> what did you learn from the docs and tutorials?
[13:43:03] <Edvard> bad habbits
[13:43:11] <Edvard> how to use basic elements etc
[13:43:15] <duch_kazatel> like?
[13:43:16] <Edvard> document.ready stuff
[13:43:21] <Edvard> .on
[13:43:22] <duch_kazatel> that's a good thing.
[13:43:23] <Edvard> events
[13:43:24] <duch_kazatel> document ready is fine.
[13:43:34] <Edvard> i feel everything is dated that i learnt
[13:43:46] <Edvard> and making a real world project is not the same
[13:43:49] <duch_kazatel> you probably learned a lot of basics that aren't outdated.
[13:44:27] <Edvard> html + css was i was ok at
[13:45:27] <Edvard> for example, do you always use the most recent jquery version?
[13:45:41] <duch_kazatel> terrible question :)
[13:45:45] <Edvard> i have read some people choose based on needs,  i generally go for the most recent
[13:45:58] <duch_kazatel> i work for a large ecommerce site.  we're updating everything to latest right now.
[13:46:30] <Edvard> i thoughted updated generally meant, more support and less bugs
[13:46:36] <duch_kazatel> if I were to start a project from scratch, i'd choose the most recent version.
[13:46:41] <duch_kazatel> it does.
[13:46:49] <Edvard> one worry solved
[13:47:08] <Edvard> thanx
[13:47:25] <Edvard> duch have are relation to your nationality?
[13:47:40] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:48:27] <Edvard> are you Dutch :P
[13:48:27] <drej> he's asking if you're dutch
[13:48:35] <duch_kazatel> oh.  nop0e.
[13:48:43] <Edvard> unless your American
[13:48:49] <duch_kazatel> i am in fact American.
[13:48:53] <Edvard> then it sounds more like, Deuch
[13:48:57] <Edvard> oh shit
[13:49:16] <Edvard> what accent do you have?
[13:49:17] <duch_kazatel> but it's not an english word ;)
[13:49:22] <duch_kazatel> I'm from california.
[13:49:33] <Edvard> is it Turkish?
[13:49:36] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:49:37] <Edvard> wild guess
[13:49:51] <duch_kazatel> it's pronounced like "duke"
[13:50:05] <Edvard> no idea
[13:50:09] <Edvard> was going to say Mexican
[13:50:13] <Edvard> or Spanish
[13:50:24] <duch_kazatel> lol mexican IS spanish :)
[13:50:27] <duch_kazatel> just a dialect.
[13:50:35] <Edvard> i know thats why i kinda did not want to say
[13:50:47] <Edvard> eg: a Mexican title
[13:50:52] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:51:05] <Edvard> French
[13:51:10] <Edvard> it looks French
[13:51:12] <Edvard> lol
[13:52:12] <Edvard> btw, the })(jQuery);
[13:52:17] <Edvard> the closing part of the function
[13:52:51] <duch_kazatel> yeah?
[13:52:52] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel's accent is all "hey bra.. tootalleh!"
[13:53:06] <Edvard> what does it mean
[13:53:06] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta wrong valley ;)
[13:53:23] <duch_kazatel> Edvard did you read any of the stuff i sent?
[13:53:24] <Edvard> i was given a map without a key
[13:53:26] <Velveeta> edward: it's executing that function immediately, and passing jQuery in as a parameter
[13:53:31] <Edvard> yeah still reading right now
[13:53:36] <Edvard> param
[13:53:37] <Velveeta> go read about IIFE's
[13:53:44] <Edvard> i need to go back and read up on functions
[13:54:07] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: then is your accent all like "GIT TO DA CHOPPAAAAA! TAKE MY HONNNNND! AGHHHHHHH!" ?
[13:54:19] <Velveeta> those are the only 2 valleys i know
[13:54:26] <Velveeta> well, that and the rio grand valley.. mayne
[13:55:02] <duch_kazatel> if you're from where I'm from, we sound pretty normal, until we say "hella"
[13:55:15] <Edvard> self-executing anonymous function is the same as IIFE
[13:55:16] <Edvard> ?
[13:55:23] <Edvard> just another title?
[13:55:23] <duch_kazatel> Edvard right, but the wrong name for iot/.
[13:55:25] <duch_kazatel> *it
[13:55:27] <Velveeta> yep
[13:55:52] <Edvard> wrong name?
[13:55:57] <Velveeta> right, certain people take issue with the "self-executing" part of the name
[13:56:06] <Velveeta> IIFE is the currently accepted lingo :D
[13:56:28] <Edvard> this is part of the prob, reading shit online that is dated or uses terms that are not common
[13:56:38] <Velveeta> well, that's still a common name for it
[13:56:40] <duch_kazatel> the article form ben alman explains why "self-executing anonymous function" isn't technically correct.
[13:56:44] <Edvard> w3schools loved or hated here?
[13:56:48] <Velveeta> but IIFE is the *more* commonly accepted name
[13:56:49] <duch_kazatel> hated.
[13:56:50] <Velveeta> hated
[13:56:52] <Edvard> thats the one am reading atm
[13:56:54] <duch_kazatel> run away from them.
[13:56:59] <Velveeta> yes, run away :D
[13:57:02] <Edvard> how about w3school as a basic ref ?
[13:57:04] <Velveeta> read mdn, or html5rocks
[13:57:08] <duch_kazatel> no.
[13:57:11] <Edvard> good
[13:57:14] <duch_kazatel> !g w3foolks
[13:57:15] <Velveeta> for basic ref, use mdn
[13:57:16] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Sorry, no results for â€Ÿw3foolksâ€.
[13:57:17] <duch_kazatel> !g w3fools
[13:57:18] <Edvard> html5rocks i read
[13:57:21] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: W3Fools â€“ Better web education for all â†’ http://www.w3fools.com/
[13:57:23] <Edvard> i find mdn harder to follow
[13:57:26] <Edvard> :(
[13:57:38] <Edvard> you need a manual to read the manual
[13:57:42] <ciqsteve> why does this alert not get alerted?  (scroll event)
[13:57:44] <ciqsteve> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vkBtc
[13:58:30] <duch_kazatel> because that element doesn't get the event.
[13:58:32] <duch_kazatel> window does
[13:59:01] <ciqsteve> http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[13:59:03] <Velveeta> right, you have to set that element's internal overflow to scroll/auto to make it get its own scroll event
[13:59:06] <ciqsteve> shows and example with it..
[13:59:14] <ciqsteve> $( "#target" ).scroll(function() {
[13:59:24] <ciqsteve> Vel - ahhh ok
[13:59:30] <duch_kazatel> ciqsteve right, so limit the height of that element and set the overflow to "scroll"
[13:59:48] <duch_kazatel> el
[13:59:51] <ciqsteve> or just attach to window - I'm kinda indifferent, right?
[13:59:52] <duch_kazatel> err codepen.io/anon/pen/hsrzH
[13:59:54] <Velveeta> like this: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/AydIt
[14:00:05] <Velveeta> or yes, attach to the window, it depends on how scoped you want that scroll listener
[14:00:27] <ciqsteve> my container size is unknown
[14:00:37] <ciqsteve> so I guess I'll just hook to window.
[14:01:23] <ciqsteve> thanks Vel and Duch for quick reply
[14:03:12] <Edvard> am a idiot
[14:03:28] <Edvard> i was trying to access the lightbox plugin before the jquery.js
[14:05:45] <Edvard> is that common sense?
[14:05:54] <duch_kazatel> generally.
[14:06:06] <Edvard> i thought so, but was not sure if i made a difference in some cases
[14:06:20] <Edvard> i noticed in the past i had to order the scripts
[14:06:21] <duch_kazatel> it can, but generall you want to load jquery first.,
[14:06:32] <Edvard> does help :(
[14:06:47] <Edvard> own stupidity is shocking at times
[14:06:56] <duch_kazatel> nah, not stupidity.  you're learning.
[14:07:42] <Edvard> learning isnt getting me a job :(
[14:07:47] <Edvard> but i enjoy it
[14:08:13] <gizmore> i have an old clumsy 1.0 site that i want to turn jquerymobile
[14:08:39] <gizmore> content of links to plaintextfiles are not shown?
[14:09:04] <gizmore> if they are returned as content-type: text/html?
[14:17:43] <duch_kazatel> Edvard gotta walk before you can run.
[14:17:58] <shaunt> Hi everyone, I'm trying to make an array of class names using the .not selector, but can't seem to figure out how. Does anyone here have any suggestions?
[14:18:21] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ shaunt
[14:18:21] <b-ot> shaunt: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:27:20] <shaunt> http://jsfiddle.net/Lx9mv/
[14:27:35] <shaunt> That's a simplified version of what I'm working with, but the jquery is more or less the same
[14:27:57] <shaunt> oops, please disregard the masonry portion, I copied and pasted
[14:29:09] <duch_kazatel> not following.
[14:29:14] <duch_kazatel> i don't see anything with class item
[14:30:02] <duch_kazatel> and do you want the classnames, or the elements themselves?
[14:30:05] <shaunt> sorry about that, here's the updated versoin
[14:30:06] <shaunt> http://jsfiddle.net/Lx9mv/1/
[14:30:11] <shaunt> just the class names
[14:32:09] <duch_kazatel> that's kind of strange, but okay.
[14:32:43] <shaunt> Any suggestions?
[14:32:50] <shaunt> I'm not sure what to do next
[14:33:00] <duch_kazatel> i'm cooking up an example, but why do you want an array of class names?
[14:33:21] <skinux>   /whois Velveeta
[14:33:23] <shaunt> I'm using for the 'remove' function in jquery masonry
[14:33:36] <shaunt> so that it can remove all items except for the corner stamp
[14:33:37] <skinux> Velveeta: ?
[14:33:38] <Velveeta>  /i-is Velveeta
[14:34:15] <skinux> Looking at your foreach loop, is $PersonID->Person meant to be Person->PersonID?
[14:34:30] <duch_kazatel> shaunt you should be able to just pass the filtered elements to that.
[14:34:32] <duch_kazatel> no need for an array.
[14:34:52] <Velveeta> well, it's been close to 3 years since i touched php, so possibly...
[14:35:07] <ciqsteve> does jquery run single-threaded or multi-threaded
[14:35:08] <ciqsteve> ?
[14:35:34] <duch_kazatel> ciqsteve wat
[14:35:37] <duch_kazatel> you mean javascript, right?
[14:36:00] <ciqsteve> yeah.. I do
[14:36:21] <Velveeta> single
[14:36:21] <ciqsteve> I'm dynamically loading an img with an .each(..)
[14:36:36] <duch_kazatel> ciqsteve that has nothing to do with threads ;)
[14:36:39] <ciqsteve> the fact I'm loading images will cause other images to not be loaded
[14:36:47] <Velveeta> wat
[14:36:51] <ciqsteve> :)
[14:37:01] <ciqsteve> I'm loading images in the viewport dynamically
[14:37:07] <Velveeta> ok..
[14:37:12] <Velveeta> why would that cause other images not to load?
[14:37:17] <ciqsteve> with they are 'empty' I can fit 10 containers.. with images I fit 3 containers
[14:37:18] <duch_kazatel> you're wondering how to load things in a way that doesn't block the browser.
[14:37:37] <duch_kazatel> you're going to run into pipelining issues eventually.
[14:37:53] <duch_kazatel> shaunt so why not just pass the jquery object of the relevant elements?
[14:38:10] <ciqsteve> $("myelements").each(load img)
[14:38:19] <duch_kazatel> ciqsteve define "load"
[14:38:28] <shaunt> I'm trying that right now
[14:38:29] <ciqsteve> by the 4th each the container is off the screen (in theory)
[14:38:33] <shaunt> but it's not removing the blocks
[14:38:57] <ciqsteve> load- sorry I just set the src using attr
[14:39:05] <duch_kazatel> use .prop() for that btw.
[14:39:13] <Velveeta> ciqsteve: so what's the problem you're actually experiencing?
[14:39:46] <ciqsteve> I'm loading images that are not visible in the viewport b/c their container *was* in the viewport before the images above started loading
[14:39:48] <duch_kazatel> shaunt and you're doing something like var $toRemove = $('.item').not('.corner-stamp');
[14:39:52] <ciqsteve> (does that make sense?_)
[14:40:08] <duch_kazatel> ciqsteve nope.
[14:40:17] <ciqsteve> hehe  I can roll with that
[14:40:19] <Velveeta> you want to lazy load images, but as the images load, it expands their container to the point that now non-visible images are being loaded, am i reading that right?
[14:40:27] <ciqsteve> Vel-  yes!
[14:40:32] <duch_kazatel> that's funky.
[14:40:45] <ciqsteve> and its a lot of images
[14:40:48] <amomchilov> Hey, jq noob here, and I need a hand adapting a piece of code to my site. It uses "document.body.clientWidth" to determine the size of an element, but this breaks on my website, whose body tag has a min-width property. What's the best way to get the width of the body tag, and make my element stretch to fit it, even when the window is smaller than the min width of the body?
[14:40:49] <shaunt> It's var remove = ($('.item').not(document.getElementsByClassName( "corner-stamp" ))); followed by $('.item').masonry('remove',remove);
[14:40:50] <Velveeta> the only way to rectify something like that is gonna be to set the image containers with a min-width or something
[14:41:04] <Velveeta> if you know the sizes of your images, use css to size their containers
[14:41:07] <duch_kazatel> shaunt do what I did.
[14:41:09] <shaunt> which is producing a "cannot call methods on masonry prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'remove'" error
[14:41:31] <ciqsteve> velv - yeah my issue is they must be small to start... they are just displaying a header with info in it
[14:41:36] <duch_kazatel> shaunt you've got too many parens and might be doing things out of order.
[14:41:40] <Velveeta> amomchilov: $('body').width()
[14:41:48] <ciqsteve> so only 75 px tall... then with image possibly 1700px tall
[14:42:06] <amomchilov> OHHHH
[14:42:10] <amomchilov> the quotes!
[14:42:13] <ciqsteve> what if I put a 100ms delay in the each iterator?
[14:42:15] <Velveeta> ciqsteve: then in that case, you'll have to load them one at a time, as a processing queue, and not kick off the next load check until the previous one has finished loading
[14:42:24] <amomchilov> I tried that but totally forgot the quotes, thanks Velveeta: solved!
[14:42:31] <Velveeta> amomchilov: no problemo :)
[14:42:48] <duch_kazatel> ciqsteve don't delay things like that basically ever.  you'll start with one problem and end up with two.
[14:42:53] <duch_kazatel> kind of like regular expressions ;)
[14:42:59] <Velveeta> lol, i was about to type that :D
[14:43:23] <shaunt> duch_kazatel that didn't work unfortunately, the error still exists
[14:43:24] <Velveeta> the other day, i was complaining about visual studio's proprietary regex syntax when i had to search a project for something
[14:43:29] <ciqsteve> duch - heh.. yeah wasn' crazy about the delay idea as I figured the browser was running it in parallel anyay
[14:43:40] <Velveeta> and i said something along the lines of "damnit, i have to search visual studio with a regular expression.. now i have 3 problems"
[14:43:42] <duch_kazatel> ciqsteve errr, get out of that mindset.
[14:43:43] <ciqsteve> I'll just do Velvs idea.  thanks velv
[14:44:03] <duch_kazatel> you need to think of it in terms of synchronous vs asynchronous
[14:44:04] <ciqsteve> and duch (2nd time todya_
[14:44:18] <Velveeta> right, not in terms of single vs multi threaded, or parallel loading
[14:44:23] <Velveeta> syncronous vs asynchronous is correct
[14:44:32] <duch_kazatel> yeah exactly.
[14:44:35] <duch_kazatel> browser are weird.
[14:44:38] <duch_kazatel> *browsers
[14:44:38] <Velveeta> js will kick off one task and then ignore it and check back later, and do other things in the meantime
[14:45:02] <ciqsteve> y figured
[14:45:11] <Velveeta> so it's single threaded, but the asynchronous nature allows you to do things as if it were multi threaded, provided your code is written to use async functionality
[14:45:16] <duch_kazatel> also promises.
[14:45:22] <ciqsteve> can I even assume an .each will execute in order found in the dom?
[14:45:33] <Velveeta> i less than three promises
[14:45:46] <duch_kazatel> sort of?  that's an ephemeral concept.
[14:45:49] <duch_kazatel> "order found
[14:45:51] <Velveeta> ciqsteve: dom order is a dicey topic
[14:45:53] <Velveeta> right
[14:46:01] <duch_kazatel> if order matters, cook up an array and use that instead.
[14:46:25] <Velveeta> if you have 2 sibling divs with child divs, do you read them as sequential siblings first, and then iterate over children, or traverse an entire child path before moving on to a sibling as far as "order"
[14:46:51] <onethfour3> what is the point of making a jquery plugin, why not just have my own javascript class which does all the work
[14:47:00] <ciqsteve> order matters b/c -- for a different reason-- I'm tracking the container top position in the dom.. .when images load they all change.. so Id like to do it when I add the image.. but I can only do that if everything 'above' it has already been addded
[14:47:08] <duch_kazatel> onethfour3 :( there's no just thing as a javascript class.
[14:47:20] <duch_kazatel> and jquery plugins are convenient in some cases.
[14:47:29] <ciqsteve> 'they all change..'   the positions all change
[14:47:44] <ciqsteve> I'll just run a second iteration when first is done..
[14:47:56] <duch_kazatel> ciqsteve make an array in the backend that you use as your master queue.
[14:48:12] <ciqsteve> not a bad idea..
[14:48:41] <Velveeta> onethfour3: if you want to just use constructor functions, the same question could be rephrased as "what is the point of using jquery, why not just have my own javascript constructors that do all the work"?
[14:48:56] <duch_kazatel> onethfour3 it really depends on the case.  we built a plugin because we needed some frontend functionality to be basically plug and play almost anywhere on the site.
[14:49:03] <duch_kazatel> it wound up being a super easy way to accomplish that.
[14:49:13] <Velveeta> you write code as a jquery plugin if you're doing extensive work with jquery collections, as a process that eases maintenance and makes your code more homogenous
[14:50:25] <onethfour3> well writing a plugin is a tedious task almost not worth it
[14:50:38] <duch_kazatel> onethfour3 wat
[14:50:42] <duch_kazatel> it's actually super easy.
[14:50:49] <onethfour3> not for what I'm doing
[14:51:02] <duch_kazatel> then it's probably not a good choice for a plugin.
[14:51:36] <duch_kazatel> or you might not be approaching the problem in ~*the jquery way*~
[14:52:50] <duch_kazatel> ugh somebody wrote this mootools class using bizarro hybrid functional composition and it's making my head hurt.
[14:52:55] <Velveeta> writing a plugin is just as easy as writing a constructor function
[14:53:04] <Velveeta> you just wrap it in a $.fn.functionName = function () {}
[14:53:06] <Velveeta> done
[15:01:14] <ciqsteve> ok.. back .. appreciate the help thinking about this
[15:01:25] <ciqsteve> after my 'each' is done loading the images
[15:01:35] <ciqsteve> I run another loop to recalc their positions on the screen
[15:01:47] <ciqsteve> however, that loop runs in entirety before the first image even loads
[15:01:50] <ciqsteve> (ugh)
[15:02:29] <ciqsteve> can I make the image update a closure and put the pos recalc inside?
[15:02:34] <ciqsteve> (not sure I'm saying that right)
[15:03:00] <duch_kazatel> sure, but that doesn't have anything to do with what you want.
[15:03:11] <ciqsteve> mixed emotions about that
[15:03:12] <ciqsteve> :)
[15:03:24] <duch_kazatel> a closure is just a function that contains other functions.
[15:03:27] <ciqsteve> b/c the closure wouldnt wait for the load either
[15:03:29] <duch_kazatel> it "closes over" them.
[15:03:43] <duch_kazatel> closures have nothing to do with loading and everything to do with scope.
[15:03:46] <ciqsteve> is there a way to fire an event with the image finishes loading?
[15:03:51] <ciqsteve> with =when
[15:03:58] <duch_kazatel> they fire an event now - load.
[15:04:07] <ciqsteve> on completion?
[15:04:10] <duch_kazatel> yes
[15:04:21] <ciqsteve> f'ing a.  great.  thx
[15:04:30] <duch_kazatel> be aware that those do NOT bubble, though.
[15:04:35] <duch_kazatel> so you need to bind directly.
[15:05:30] <Velveeta> right, each image you kickoff a load for by setting its src attribute, you'll also want to bind a load listener to, which just rechecks to see if another image needs to be loaded
[15:05:53] <Velveeta> just have a single function that checks image locations and whether one needs to be loaded, and call that function over and over in your image load handlers
[15:05:58] <ciqsteve> $('mycontainers').on('load' function()..)
[15:06:17] <ciqsteve> that way?
[15:06:20] <Velveeta> i'm assuming that's a class reference
[15:06:25] <ciqsteve> yes
[15:06:30] <Velveeta> and if so, if .mycontainers are each of your <img> tags, then yes
[15:06:53] <duch_kazatel> $('.myCOntainers').on('load', function(){});
[15:07:46] <ciqsteve> y ty duch just being lazy typing..   so, to probably state the obvious... not bubbling up means I can't attach the load even to a parent element its gotta go on the actual el
[15:07:52] <ciqsteve> even=event
[15:07:53] <duch_kazatel>  yep
[15:08:26] <AnTi_MTtr> hey anyone use jquery waypoints?
[15:08:36] <AnTi_MTtr> im trying to do some real basic implementation of it but im having trouble
[15:08:42] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ AnTi_MTtr
[15:08:42] <b-ot> AnTi_MTtr: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[15:08:45] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ AnTi_MTtr
[15:08:47] <b-ot> AnTi_MTtr: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:08:52] <AnTi_MTtr> if i specify (window) it works ok
[15:09:05] <AnTi_MTtr> but i fi specify an ('#element') with an id
[15:09:09] <AnTi_MTtr> it doesnt work whatsoever
[15:09:25] <AnTi_MTtr> is waypoint something that should be loaded after content?
[15:09:29] <AnTi_MTtr> or can it be done before?
[15:09:49] <duch_kazatel> it would have to be on document ready at least i'll bet
[15:10:30] <AnTi_MTtr> http://jsbin.com/gobeqake/1/edit
[15:10:34] <AnTi_MTtr> thats the bit of code im using
[15:10:39] <AnTi_MTtr> straight off their demo site
[15:10:54] <AnTi_MTtr> but aslong as i put a #id in their and not the window it never actualy triggers
[15:10:57] <duch_kazatel> that would need to be in a document ready or right before you close body.
[15:11:11] <AnTi_MTtr> yeah
[15:11:16] <AnTi_MTtr> i put it right before i closed my body
[15:11:24] <duch_kazatel> any console errors?
[15:11:48] <AnTi_MTtr> no console errors that i can see
[15:11:55] <AnTi_MTtr> i copied what i have at the bottom of my body
[15:12:15] <AnTi_MTtr> notify does a console output right?
[15:12:21] <duch_kazatel> notify?
[15:12:35] <AnTi_MTtr> its some func that is in the demo code
[15:12:38] <AnTi_MTtr> see my paste
[15:12:47] <duch_kazatel> link
[15:12:58] <AnTi_MTtr> http://jsbin.com/gobeqake/1/edit
[15:13:35] <duch_kazatel> try console.log() instead.
[15:13:41] <duch_kazatel> never heard of notify
[15:14:15] <AnTi_MTtr> ahh!
[15:14:23] <AnTi_MTtr> look i get a thing on my console now
[15:14:32] <AnTi_MTtr> ok so im going to change it to alert and see if that works
[15:14:33] <Velveeta> i'm seeing this: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[15:14:56] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta yeah, becuase they put script tags in the javascript area on jsbin >.>
[15:15:01] <Velveeta> gotcha
[15:15:02] <AnTi_MTtr> its working now
[15:15:05] <AnTi_MTtr> thanks guys
[15:15:14] <AnTi_MTtr> im sure ill have more questions
[15:15:15] <duch_kazatel> it was working before, too ;)
[15:15:21] <AnTi_MTtr> im trying to get parralax going
[15:15:38] * Velveeta shivers.
[15:15:53] <AnTi_MTtr> lol
[15:15:56] <ciqsteve> will img load fire if there is no source (which is the case when the dom loads)
[15:16:02] <mehdilamaaffar> very active guy
[15:16:03] <ciqsteve> no src=
[15:16:11] <Velveeta> ciqsteve: i don't *think* so
[15:16:37] <duch_kazatel> i can't remember.
[15:17:13] <AnTi_MTtr> ok so how do i do the domready deal iwth jquery?
[15:17:20] <AnTi_MTtr> !docs domready
[15:17:26] <duch_kazatel> $(function(){ /* your code here */ });
[15:17:39] <AnTi_MTtr> ahh so the code i already had should do that
[15:17:43] <AnTi_MTtr> jQuery('#poop').waypoint(function() {
[15:17:44] <duch_kazatel> or $(document).ready(function() {/* your code here */})
[15:17:47] <duch_kazatel> no.
[15:17:48] <AnTi_MTtr> that would be ondomready?
[15:17:50] <AnTi_MTtr> oh
[15:18:16] <AnTi_MTtr> so wrap what i have in a  $(function(){

[15:27:39] <duch_kazatel> there
[15:27:41] <duch_kazatel> mine had a typo.
[15:28:01] <AnTi_MTtr> thanks
[16:05:06] <duch_kazatel> oh goddammit i hate coldfusion
[16:06:18] <SoldierCoder> i hate cold fusion too
[16:06:51] <Fall> me too
[16:07:02] <Fall> I used to code in a language called "WebMerger", very CF style xyntax
[16:07:07] <Fall> basically was a rip of CF lol
[16:07:16] <Fall> ughhh the hacks
[16:08:29] <duch_kazatel> i mean cfscript isn't too bad, but jesus christ is the templating awkward.
[16:09:18] <NaN> how can I stop event propagation on something like this > http://jsfiddle.net/8EDV7/
[16:09:30] <__joshua___> return false
[16:09:36] <__joshua___> or e.stopPropagation()
[16:09:44] <duch_kazatel> don't return false if you can.
[16:09:50] <__joshua___> yeah, might burn you later
[16:09:56] <duch_kazatel> use stopPropagation() whenever possible :)
[16:10:04] <NaN> lets see
[16:10:26] <NaN> cool!
[16:10:42] <NaN> so stopPropagation() is like preventDefault for anchors
[16:10:50] <duch_kazatel> different concepts.
[16:11:14] <NaN> yeah but it 'stop' the 'next default action'
[16:11:15] <duch_kazatel> preventDefault() prevents the default action.  stopPropagation() stops the event from propagating.
[16:11:21] <duch_kazatel> no.
[16:11:28] <NaN> so propagation isn't by default?
[16:11:47] <NaN> I mean, isn't propagation a default behaviour?
[16:11:49] <duch_kazatel> it is by default.  one has to do with that the event would normall do, the other with bubbling.
[16:11:50] <__joshua___> yes it is (look up bubbling)
[16:12:06] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963669/whats-the-difference-between-event-stoppropagation-and-event-preventdefault
[16:12:20] <NaN> nice link duch_kazatel , let me read it
[16:12:21] <NaN> thanks
[16:13:05] <__joshua___> defaultAction example = clicking a <a> to follow a link.  propagation example = click event on a <a>, then on its parent element, then its parent etc
[16:17:48] <nhulea_wed> yo
[16:17:55] <duch_kazatel> whuddup
[16:18:12] <nhulea_wed> just working hows it going
[16:18:52] <duch_kazatel> not too bad.
[16:18:55] <duch_kazatel> hating mootools atm.
[16:19:05] <nhulea_wed> damn I have never used mootools
[16:19:26] <duch_kazatel> good.
[16:19:36] <nhulea_wed> what about scriptaculous
[16:19:41] <duch_kazatel> hahahahahahaha
[16:19:52] <duch_kazatel> that's a name i haven't heard in a long time.

[16:20:27] <systemfault> nhulea_wed: Welcome back to 2004 :)
[16:20:28] <nhulea_wed> apparently NASA, Apple and IKea use it
[16:20:32] <duch_kazatel> jesus
[16:20:43] <systemfault> Apple like sproutcore AFAIK
[16:20:44] <tw2113> see what happens when you defund NASA?
[16:21:08] <nhulea_wed> who uses it? Freckle time tracking Â· NASA Â· Apple IKEA Â· Basecamp Â· Gucci Â· Shopify  Charm Customer Support Â· Backpack  Ruby on Rails
[16:21:15] <duch_kazatel> that's terrifyng.
[16:21:38] <tw2113> if you want to use it too, go for it
[16:21:41] <tw2113> i won't stop you
[16:21:51] <nhulea_wed> what the hell is freckle time tracking
[16:22:13] <systemfault> Time tracking for redheads only ?
[16:22:15] <tw2113> http://letsfreckle.com/
[16:22:19] <systemfault> (quick guess)
[16:22:31] <nhulea_wed> holy shit your rioght
[16:22:35] <nhulea_wed> right *
[16:23:38] <duch_kazatel> "lets freckle" sounds like a sexual harassment case.
[16:23:59] * tw2113 throws a sponge at duch_kazatel scrub your mind dude
[16:24:14] <nhulea_wed> I bought this book about ajax a long time ago and it recommended scriptacylous for ajax I am thinking that was reading the wrong thing
[16:24:30] <duch_kazatel> you should throw away that book on ajax.
[16:24:33] <nhulea_wed> somebody get a sponge
[16:24:41] <duch_kazatel> and then contact the publisher and then them for the joke.
[16:24:44] <duch_kazatel> *thank them
[16:24:50] <nhulea_wed> haha
[16:25:00] <nhulea_wed> let me see if I can find it on amazon
[16:25:05] <tw2113> duch_kazatel, it was probably valid at a time
[16:25:12] <tw2113> but then the web moved on to better ways
[16:25:38] <nhulea_wed> holy shit all the demos are pretty much gone
[16:25:45] <nhulea_wed> from the scriptaculous site
[16:26:06] <tw2113> may be a good sign to use a different lib
[16:26:08] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 yeah i know.
[16:26:12] <tw2113> if they're not maintaining anything
[16:27:37] <nhulea_wed> https://github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous last commit was 3 years ago
[16:27:43] <duch_kazatel> i was just about do say that,
[16:28:02] <duch_kazatel> http://mir.aculo.us/
[16:28:04] <nhulea_wed> haha
[16:28:10] <duch_kazatel> aaaah dude went on to do Zepto.js
[16:28:20] <nhulea_wed> yea I have heard that too
[16:28:46] <nhulea_wed> good advertising
[16:28:47] <nhulea_wed> Zepto is a minimalist JavaScript library for modern browsers with a largely jQuery-compatible API. If you use jQuery, you already know how to use Zepto.
[16:29:00] <duch_kazatel> yep.  i wish we could use zepto here actually >.>
[16:29:12] <nhulea_wed> everyone here already knows aepto
[16:29:18] <nhulea_wed> zepto*
[16:29:24] <systemfault> I just want to use vanilla dom :P
[16:29:29] <systemfault> No more DOM libs :P
[16:29:42] <nhulea_wed> sounds good to me
[16:30:03] <systemfault> nhulea_wed: Depends if you need to support IE8â€¦ or older.
[16:31:08] <nhulea_wed> I dont really want to if I dont ahve too
[16:31:10] <nhulea_wed> have*
[16:31:40] <nhulea_wed> but I do like using IE 8
[16:31:50] <nhulea_wed> its fun and easy to use
[16:31:57] <systemfault> IE8.. the last browser that is actually used that doesn't support HTML5.
[16:32:12] <nhulea_wed> christ
[16:32:16] <nhulea_wed> are you serious
[16:32:22] <systemfault> Yup.
[16:32:38] <nhulea_wed> holy shit that is pitiful
[16:34:34] <nhulea_wed> I love html 5 canvas
[16:40:15] <duch_kazatel> i am geeking out today on old school drum and bass.
[16:41:45] <nhulea_wed> hell yeah the fixx ?

[16:44:13] <duch_kazatel> nhulea_wed no way!
[16:44:21] <duch_kazatel> he does some great stuff.
[16:44:33] <nhulea_wed> yeah I made this stupid site for him like 2 years ago
[16:44:51] <decx> i burned out on metalheadz in 2002
[16:44:59] <decx> and dnb as a whole
[16:45:04] <duch_kazatel> I could see that decx
[16:45:04] <decx> so much repetition
[16:45:06] <nhulea_wed> I worked for a online marketing bullshit company
[16:45:15] <nhulea_wed> one sec let me see if it still exits
[16:45:20] <nhulea_wed> exisits
[16:45:29] <duch_kazatel> i fell in love with london elektricity and hospital not that long ago.
[16:45:40] <decx> i had every release and we always had one or two acts from the uk every weekend
[16:45:47] <nhulea_wed> haha yeah here it is jesus its bad http://theconfluencegroup.com/photek/
[16:46:35] <decx> then i got into idm which is so diverse that i'm still into it
[16:46:51] <duch_kazatel> i loved squarepusher up until hello meow.
[16:47:28] <decx> then you missed out on just a souvenier
[16:47:41] <decx> -e
[16:47:56] <systemfault> Me too.. back in ~2000 â€¦ aphex twin/squarepusher/autechre/plaid/etc...
[16:48:10] <decx> plaid was just here a few weeks ago
[16:48:15] <nhulea_wed> i like aphex twin for sure
[16:48:16] <duch_kazatel> any of it like his older stuff?
[16:48:31] <decx> andy always gets black out drunk after the gigs
[16:48:36] <decx> it's emberassing ^^
[16:48:41] <systemfault> Haha
[16:49:18] <decx> they have a cool html5 project going on
[16:49:37] <decx> http://tether.plaid.co.uk/
[16:51:27] <nhulea_wed> decx: that is awesome
[16:51:35] <AnTi_MTtr> can jquery select via an anchors href attribute?
[16:51:57] <AnTi_MTtr> can it select using xpath or css paths?
[16:52:08] <nhulea_wed> .attr()
[16:52:26] <duch_kazatel> you can select using attribute selectors, yes
[16:52:32] <duch_kazatel> but i would avoid doing that.
[16:52:39] <AnTi_MTtr> ahh any reason?
[16:52:39] <nhulea_wed> oh shit sorry
[16:52:45] <AnTi_MTtr> what im trying to do
[16:52:55] <duch_kazatel> because href is not something you would normally select on.
[16:52:58] <AnTi_MTtr> is change the attribute of an anchor
[16:53:01] <duch_kazatel> it's slow.
[16:53:15] <decx> nhulea_wed it's on github https://github.com/warprecords/tether
[16:53:28] <AnTi_MTtr> and you can slect classes using $('.class') right?
[16:53:33] <duch_kazatel> $('a[href="alink.com"]');, but give the link an ID or Class instead.
[16:53:45] <nhulea_wed> oh wow I am going to fork the shit out of that
[16:53:51] <nhulea_wed> decx: thanks
[16:54:45] <AnTi_MTtr> duch_kazatel: so more about selection, if i wanted to select an anchor inside an id'd li tag, would this work? example: $('.item103 a')
[16:54:58] <AnTi_MTtr> in otherwwords all anchors inside that id's tag
[16:55:05] <duch_kazatel> that's not an ID.
[16:55:07] <duch_kazatel> that's a class.
[16:55:11] <AnTi_MTtr> you're right
[16:55:13] <duch_kazatel> #item103 would be an id.
[16:55:13] <AnTi_MTtr> yes thats a class
[16:55:21] <duch_kazatel> is that going to be unique?
[16:55:24] <AnTi_MTtr> can you do it with a class or would only id work?
[16:55:35] <duch_kazatel> you can do it with either, just like with CSS.
[16:55:36] <AnTi_MTtr> it should be unique yes, its just the way this cms builds its menus
[16:55:44] <duch_kazatel> $('any valid css selector here')
[16:55:51] <AnTi_MTtr> ahh very cool
[16:55:52] <AnTi_MTtr> ok
[16:55:59] <duch_kazatel> plus some extras
[16:56:07] <AnTi_MTtr> makes things so much nicer that way
[16:57:01] <AnTi_MTtr> so in theory i could even do something like this: $('body.logo-type-osmosis.demostyle-type-preset1.mainmenuanimation-enabled-1.pagesurround-alignment-center.pagesurround-type-preset1.headersurround-type-preset1.mainbody-overlay-light.font-family-osmosis.font-size-is-default.menu-type-dropdownmenu.layout-mode-fluidresponsive.col12.option-com-content.menu-main div#rt-page-surround div.rt-container
[16:57:01] <AnTi_MTtr> section#rt-sidepanel-surround.rt-9-cols div#rt-sidepanel-content.rt-sidepanel-fixed.rt-sidepanel-animated div.rt-sidepanel-wrapper div.rt-grid-3.rt-alpha.rt-omega div.sidepmenu-block ul.gf-menu.l1 li.item103 a.item')
[16:57:08] <duch_kazatel> woah
[16:57:08] <AnTi_MTtr> thats like a complete css path
[16:57:10] <AnTi_MTtr> for the element
[16:57:16] <duch_kazatel> don't paste that much.
[16:57:19] <AnTi_MTtr> sorry
[16:57:25] <duch_kazatel> and you could, but there's no need to.
[16:57:40] <AnTi_MTtr> yeah
[16:57:46] <AnTi_MTtr> i can get away with a smaller path than that
[16:57:57] <AnTi_MTtr> just knowing i could though is very cool
[16:58:34] <duch_kazatel> i'd bet you could do just $('#rt-sidepanel-content .item103 .item');
[16:58:41] <duch_kazatel> and that would perform better than what you posted.
[16:58:52] <AnTi_MTtr> yeah
[16:58:57] <AnTi_MTtr> that looks like a winner
[17:00:26] <JesperA> i am a winner
[17:00:40] <duch_kazatel> something something "Weiner"
[17:00:51] <JesperA> :)
[17:05:50] <AnTi_MTtr> if we use jquery correctly, we're all winners!
[17:07:47] <duch_kazatel> i am falling asleep.
[17:09:47] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/j5dh6/ <-- hi guys any help on this.
[17:10:10] <duch_kazatel> you're using jquery 1.6.4
[17:10:17] <duch_kazatel> that's for first problem.
[17:10:20] <duch_kazatel> what's your question.
[17:10:48] <axscode> actually im using 1.5 but jsfiddle dont have it. any retro that i can use.
[17:10:59] <duch_kazatel> O.o
[17:11:02] <duch_kazatel> whyyyy
[17:11:16] <duch_kazatel> either way, can't run .join() on something that isn't an array
[17:11:40] <axscode> any other solution, but im i doing the rest ok?
[17:11:45] <duch_kazatel> update your copy of jquery.
[17:12:10] <duch_kazatel> looks like you're munging arrays and plain objects.
[17:13:03] <duch_kazatel> remove_ingredient.key will look for exactly that, whish doesn't make any sense in this case, and you can't use .join() like that.
[17:14:06] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/j5dh6/1/
[17:14:45] <mouses> if i keep calling $(link).click(function (...){}); to set the click event handler, does that RESET the handler or add that function in addition to the old handler? i'm having some strange issues
[17:14:52] <mouses> seems to be in a loop of some kind
[17:14:58] <duch_kazatel> mouses adds a new one each time.
[17:15:14] <mouses> hmm ok
[17:15:16] <duch_kazatel> axscode remove_ingredient.key still doesn't make sense.
[17:15:35] <axscode> hmm checking
[17:15:46] <duch_kazatel> but that sort of works i guess.
[17:15:58] <duch_kazatel> text inputs can't take linebreaks btw.
[17:16:12] <axscode> sorry can you help out.
[17:16:35] <duch_kazatel> only if you upgrade to at least jQuery 1.9
[17:16:51] <axscode> i wanted to populate the input with NO the_ingredient, but when i checkback it will also remove from the list.
[17:17:46] <duch_kazatel> plus your code is doing too much work ;)
[17:18:36] <axscode> i really dont know how to make it work :(
[17:18:49] <Egahtrac> Hello fellow coders. I have a jquery/php/ajax question
[17:18:54] <axscode> or to optimised it
[17:18:54] <duch_kazatel> upgrade the version of jquery, first, axscode
[17:19:40] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/j5dh6/2/
[17:19:43] <axscode> game its 1.9
[17:19:49] <Egahtrac> crap it'll have to wait bbiab
[17:19:53] <duch_kazatel> Egahtrac kay
[17:20:40] <duch_kazatel> axscode let me bake up a simple example/
[17:21:01] <Velveeta> he bakes the most delicious examples..
[17:23:41] <duch_kazatel> axscode http://jsfiddle.net/j5dh6/3/
[17:24:49] <axscode> deym that so clean..
[17:24:57] <Velveeta> <raisin face> sorcery!
[17:25:00] <axscode> howd you do that
[17:25:01] <duch_kazatel> that's why you update the version of jquery
[17:25:26] <duch_kazatel> first of all you were watching for a bunch of clicks you didn't need - watch for input changes instead.
[17:25:50] <Velveeta> duch_kazatel: what functionality did you use in that example that exists in 1.11 but not in 1.9?
[17:26:09] <duch_kazatel> (shhhh it works in 1.9 - he was in 1.6.4 originally)
[17:26:15] <Velveeta> ahhhhh gotcha :D
[17:26:27] <Velveeta> (whispering) er i mean, gotcha
[17:26:30] <duch_kazatel> second off when you see an input change, just find all inputs that AREN'T checked, then select their corresponding label and get said label's text.
[17:27:07] <duch_kazatel> and push that text into an array, then .join() on the array and pop that into your display area.
[17:27:11] <axscode> thanks thanks
[17:27:14] <copperhands> hello friends
[17:27:20] <axscode> ill ponder more into this
[17:27:22] <copperhands> i asked a question yesterday and got no response
[17:27:26] <copperhands> see if I have more luck today
[17:27:42] <duch_kazatel> axscode try reading it line by line and ask if you don't understand anything :)\
[17:27:51] * Velveeta rubs his hands together and waits to pounce on copperhands' question.
[17:28:21] <copperhands> http://jsfiddle.net/7rdST/4/ I have this fiddle, and I'm populating the forms by the content of the spans
[17:28:24] <copperhands> everything is good
[17:28:53] <copperhands> but the one change I need is to only populate those fields when a button is clicked
[17:29:08] <copperhands> and yesterday was my first day of jquery, so it's probably a new question
[17:29:10] <duch_kazatel> copperhands check out .on()
[17:29:13] <Velveeta> which particular button?
[17:29:13] <copperhands> *noob
[17:29:46] <copperhands> just a generic button
[17:30:11] <Velveeta> and is it just taking the first one in the list and writing that to the input, or what?
[17:30:24] <Velveeta> because i notice it only has the first item in those boxes currently
[17:30:40] <copperhands> yes
[17:30:55] <copperhands> I feel like I need to put my current script into a function and call that on.click
[17:31:01] <duch_kazatel> $('button').on('click', function() {/* your code here */});
[17:31:12] <copperhands> but I am not having any luck at doing that, I think I'm having a semantic issue
[17:31:17] <Velveeta> yep, that's pretty much it
[17:31:31] <duch_kazatel> show us your code.
[17:31:40] <copperhands> ok I'll try again and show you if it doesn't work
[17:31:43] <duch_kazatel> with that event binding
[17:31:51] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/7rdST/5/
[17:32:18] <Velveeta> i changed your button from a submit to a button type
[17:32:49] <Velveeta> it could be done with a submit button, but then you'd probably want to tie the event listener to form.submit vs button.click, and since it's only adding text to inputs, submit didn't seem semantically correct to me
[17:35:10] <copperhands> well holy shit thats awesome
[17:35:26] <copperhands> sorry language forgot I was on freenode
[17:35:29] <Velveeta> the holyshitawesomest :)
[17:35:34] <copperhands> haha cool
[17:35:37] <Velveeta> is that a thing on freenode?
[17:35:43] <copperhands> it has been for me at least
[17:35:48] <Velveeta> pfft
[17:35:51] <copperhands> but this is the first i've messed with js
[17:35:55] <copperhands> so maybe its not here
[17:36:15] <Velveeta> in javascript, eventhing is an object, including expletives
[17:36:21] <copperhands> lol
[17:36:21] <Velveeta> they're a special type of primitive data type
[17:37:08] <copperhands> in that example you fixed for me Velveeta
[17:37:39] <copperhands> i need to have more than one button so I'm not sure $('input[type="button"]') is going to work
[17:37:46] <copperhands> it seems like I would need to select by IDs
[17:37:55] <Velveeta> well that's fine, that's just working with the example i was given, and by the questions i asked
[17:38:03] <copperhands> oh no I know
[17:38:09] <copperhands> I'm just saying, how would I do that
[17:38:12] <Velveeta> if you have a more specific use case, i can show you how to do that
[17:38:27] <copperhands> can I just say $('input[type="button" id="foo"]')  ?
[17:38:42] <Velveeta> if you just need it for 1 specific button, then yes, use id's, but given that this is just adding a single, hardcoded value to those text inputs, it would seem like you'd need some different kind of setup
[17:38:48] <Velveeta> maybe a button per line or something?
[17:39:11] <Velveeta> well, to do a selector like that, you'd have to group those attributes separately, like this: $('input[type="button"][id="foo"]')
[17:39:18] <copperhands> ah ha
[17:39:20] <copperhands> let me try that
[17:39:20] <Velveeta> however, if you're gonna do that, you might as well just use the id selector
[17:39:31] <Velveeta> because it's the most specific, so simply just $('#foo')
[17:39:43] <copperhands> ok
[17:40:23] <copperhands> haha it works!
[17:40:51] <copperhands> i feel so good, js has been so much nosense to me for the past five years and now I'm feeling like a real programmer
[17:41:04] <Velveeta> heheheh
[17:41:12] <Velveeta> well, the past 5 years have been where js has really started to mature
[17:41:39] <copperhands> and me as well I think lol
[17:41:43] <Velveeta> now enterprise-level js devs are in fairly high demand, and are expected to have the same kinds of considerations to their code that backend devs are
[17:42:15] <Velveeta> amiright, duch_kazatel?
[17:42:31] <copperhands> just a few weeks ago it finally clicked that # = ID and . = class .... i'm embarrassed to say before that I was just copy pasting stuff and crossing my fingers
[17:42:54] <Velveeta> do you work w/ css at all?
[17:43:04] <Velveeta> because it pretty much just mimics css syntax, plus some extras
[17:43:21] <copperhands> yeah thats the copy pasting I was doing, then when it clicked with CSS a few weeks ago I was able to apply it to JS yesterday
[17:43:52] <Velveeta> yepyep
[17:45:20] <copperhands> im self taught so I mostly learn things as I have to. lately I've been working on more professional grade products so things have been making more sense
[17:45:56] <Velveeta> yeah i'm self taught also.... but i started in the early 90's :D
[17:46:29] <copperhands> I did as well but just messing around, I didn't get serious until around 2009 when I stopped taking drugs and needed something to occupy myself
[17:46:52] <Velveeta> yeah, i cut out my drugs around 2001 :D
[17:46:57] <Velveeta> it helps!
[17:47:41] <copperhands> Yeah, I'm having cravings recently because I have a lot more money than I'm used to and I don't know what to spend it on. Can't give in though because I have an addictive personality.
[17:51:18] <copperhands> Well look at that
[17:51:19] <copperhands> http://jsfiddle.net/7rdST/8/
[17:51:54] <copperhands> I feel like it's a n00b way to write it by using IDs but it works and that's what matters right now
[17:52:19] <mouses> my .click functions seem to be remembering the old function definitions and just adding the new functions to it almost in a loop
[17:52:45] <mouses> i keep updating the function .click event handlers on a certain link
[17:52:58] <copperhands> yeah I feel like the proper way to write it would be at least using dynamic IDs and the same function
[17:53:16] <copperhands> thats how I would do it in perl or php but I'm not familiar with JS syntax
[18:01:19] <mouses> ok i finally fucking fixed it
[18:01:54] <mouses> i fixed my issue of event handlers piling up instead of reseting...
[18:01:56] <copperhands> \0/
[18:02:05] <mouses> by using .off()
[18:02:36] <mouses> everytime i set a new handler to the link's .click() event, i first call .off() for the link
[18:02:44] <mouses> is that bad practice?
[18:02:48] <mouses> thats the only thing that worked
[18:02:55] <mouses> i spent the last 24 hours trying to fix it
[18:07:19] <thoraxe> so i have a form where i've prevented the default submit from doing anything, because i need to process a bunch of stuff, and the actual "Submit' is done via ajax on the backend and the page is updated. I'm now trying to use jqueryvalidations and I'm trying to understand the docs to figure out how I can check if the form is valid on the click and, if not, not do the next stuff.
[18:07:24] <thoraxe> code coming
[18:08:15] <Velveeta> mouses: how many times are you having to reset your click handlers?
[18:08:54] <mouses> 1-100
[18:09:04] <__joshua___> mouses: if you are doing off and ons, perhaps just use delegation
[18:09:32] <mouses> its for a video gallery with thumbnails. everytime the user clicks the thumbnail to load a video to play, one of my links changes to display info about the video
[18:09:39] <thoraxe> http://jsfiddle.net/LWLt2/
[18:09:46] <__joshua___> $(parent).on('click', 'a', show_info);
[18:09:48] <mouses> so i change the event handler for the clicking of that link
[18:10:12] <thoraxe> so basically, when someone clicks the button, I want to check the form validation and, if valid, doSomeStuff, otherwise do nothing (the validate settings will make the form show the errors)
[18:11:18] <mouses> joshua, well im not even calling on() ... i just do $(videoLink).click(function(e){...})
[18:11:28] <mouses> to set the handler
[18:11:39] <__joshua___> on('click', === .click(..
[18:11:59] <mouses> ok
[18:12:09] <mouses> well is my code good?
[18:12:13] <mouses> good practice?
[18:12:18] <__joshua___> probably not
[18:12:20] <mouses> damn
[18:12:38] <__joshua___> you generally shouldn't be removing listeners
[18:13:19] <__joshua___> want an example of delegation?
[18:13:29] <__joshua___> with a show_info function?
[18:13:32] <mouses> i call $(videoLink).off(); everytime i'm about to set $(videoLink).click() when the user clicks the thumbnail that changes the link
[18:14:38] <Velveeta> copperhands: still here?
[18:15:16] <Velveeta> mouses: the click event handler, is it just swapping out, say, a single parameter that's different for each image that changes?
[18:15:18] <mouses> do you understand what i'm trying to do, logically? imagine youtube... you have a bunch of thumnails on the right column of the page when you're watchign a video. i'm loading those new videos onto the main page area everytime the user wants to watch a new video
[18:15:36] <__joshua___> videoLink has parent element before the user clicks?  delegate from that
[18:15:41] <Velveeta> if so, you could just store that as a data parameter, and have a single click handler that reads it, and swap just the data parameter when the image changes
[18:15:45] <mouses> and then there's a link on the page for more info on the video. that link must change to display new info about the new video
[18:16:18] <Velveeta> e.g. does it change from something like http://sdf.com/image_id=123 to http://sdf.com/image_id=234 or something?
[18:17:19] <__joshua___> can you make a simple jsfiddle version of it? if you are juggling event handlers you will introduce bugs.
[18:17:31] <mouses> i think storing as data is overly complex
[18:17:38] <mouses> i read all the video data from a json file
[18:18:05] <Velveeta> that's not what i'm talking about
[18:18:17] <Velveeta> i'm trying to find out what actually changes about your click handler from image to image
[18:18:24] <mouses> making a jsfiddle will take time
[18:18:48] <mouses> the information about the video changes (the credits for producer, director, actor, etc)
[18:19:23] <Velveeta> that's the display that's being changed... what's actually being changed about the click handler? or are you hardcoding all of that data into each click handler function?
[18:19:24] <mouses> one link displays the video credits, one link displays the technical info like cameras, lenses, etc... one link displays the summary of the video
[18:19:41] <__joshua___> I think Velveeta means doing <div class="someclickableelement"  data-id="2345"/>  $(parent).on('click', '.someclickableelement', function(){ var id = $(this).attr('data-id');  do stuff with id
[18:19:51] <Velveeta> right
[18:19:52] <mouses> no hard coding... its read from a json file and dumped into a <p>
[18:20:06] <Velveeta> so the json data is pulled in via an ajax request i'm assuming?
[18:20:44] <mouses> hmm well good question.. i see what you mean by hard coding
[18:21:06] <Velveeta> hardcoding your json files is fine, that's outside the scope of the client
[18:21:23] <Velveeta> but if those json files are read in via ajax, then there's something simple that's changing from image to image to request a different json url
[18:21:24] <mouses> i guess in a way it is... when the thumbnail images are loaded when the page is loaded, the event handlers for every thumbnail are set from reading the json file about the videos
[18:21:47] <Velveeta> ok, so the json file is read once at page load, and all of that data is just held in memory or something?
[18:22:00] <mouses> its not ajax
[18:22:19] <Velveeta> well, despite how the json is read, it's occurring once, at page load, right?
[18:22:29] <Velveeta> and it holds all of the data for all of the images?
[18:22:35] <mouses> yeah the data is held in... each thumbnail has an event handler that remembers what data to display
[18:22:44] <mouses> correct
[18:23:00] <fluxx0r>  /disconnect
[18:23:27] <Velveeta> how is that json data represented? is it just an array of objects that have properties for things like producer, director, etc?
[18:24:47] <mouses> for now, its just some text as in "video" : [ { "id": 1, "credits": "producer - john williams, etc"}, {}, {}]
[18:25:13] <mouses> i dump the text into a <p> on the page
[18:25:43] <Velveeta> ok, so you have an id value there, which is really all the data you need to store in the page
[18:25:43] <mouses> i will eventually break it out at some point to have a producer, director, actor etc more extensible
[18:25:59] <Velveeta> what you can do is for each image, store something like data-id="1" on it
[18:26:16] <mouses> why is that better practice?
[18:26:18] <Velveeta> and then have a click handler that, for any image that's clicked on, gets $(this).data('id') and looks it up in your data object
[18:26:33] <Velveeta> because you have a single listener, a single implementation
[18:26:51] <Velveeta> it takes that id value, looks it up in the json, and takes that data and populates it to those places on screen that you need to display that data to
[18:27:23] <Velveeta> for another image, there's no need to swap out a click handler for it, it just has a different data-id value, you click on that image, it looks at .data('id') and sees 23, or 47, 28347, and looks up that id in your json object
[18:27:39] <mouses> oh ok
[18:27:41] <mouses> i see
[18:27:42] <mouses> hmm
[18:27:53] <mouses> thats good but will cause me to rearchitect my site
[18:28:01] <mouses> which will take a few days
[18:28:11] <mouses> is my current implementation horrible?
[18:28:20] <mouses> as far as memory?
[18:28:47] <Velveeta> well.. it's not good.. i don't know if i would use the word horrible, but it sounds like you're wasting memory and cpu by destroying and reattaching that event handler over and over
[18:29:18] <mouses> i see
[18:29:21] <mouses> thanks
[18:29:31] <mouses> what the topic i should look up to study that data stuff?
[18:31:22] <Velveeta> i can show you a quick demo, but i would look at event delegation for one thing, and probably using jquery data attributes
[18:35:13] <__joshua___> mouses: i wouldn't worry about the memory/cpu costs.  but that approach is not the best due to how fiddly it is.
[18:35:32] <mouses> ok well thanks for all the help guys
[18:35:51] <mouses> i havent updated my websites in over a year
[18:35:54] <mouses> and i've been rusty
[18:37:15] <Velveeta> mouses: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/GgF32/
[18:38:04] <Velveeta> some sample data at the top, with no id property per record, but it just uses the array index for the lookup, and a single event listener that just looks for the data('id') property, and uses that to pull the record from that data object
[18:51:14] <mouses> Velveeta: thanks dude
[18:54:22] <Velveeta> no problem, understand the concept i was going for?
[18:55:52] <mouses> almost, i'd have to research data first
[18:55:55] <mouses> but thanks
[18:56:04] <mouses> i'll learn from it
[18:56:24] * Velveeta gives a thumbs-up.
[18:56:24] <mouses> about to get back to work though, i appreciate the help
[18:56:42] <Velveeta> yeah, i have some learning stuff i gotta do tonight at some point
[18:57:23] <thoraxe> https://gist.github.com/thoraxe/0ad8f8058eb3b4f04a36 can someone explain why #1 works (calls readsinglefile) but #2 will alert valid without seemingly getting me into the readSingleFile function?
[18:58:32] <thoraxe> or do I need to share more code?
[19:00:06] <__joshua___> readSingleFile();
[19:00:24] <__joshua___> you forgot parentheses
[19:01:34] <codepython777> is there a amd friendly jquery version somewhere?
[19:02:05] <__joshua___> http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/environments/amd/
[19:02:26] <thoraxe> __joshua___: ok i'll give that a whirl. thought I had.
[19:02:28] <codepython777> __joshua___: jquery-ui != jquery, right?
[19:02:49] <__joshua___> oh right.  i just googled jquery amd and copied first link
[19:03:36] <__joshua___> are you using requirejs or somethingelse?
[19:05:35] <codepython777> __joshua___: atomify
[19:06:09] <Egahtrac> ok so i have a question
[19:06:19] <Egahtrac> i have a toggle function for a button going in jquery
[19:06:47] <Egahtrac> now when you activate it the first time it runs something in jquery and uses info from a php script
[19:06:55] <Egahtrac> using $.post
[19:07:24] <Egahtrac> now i'm stuck because when you toggle the button again in jquery i want the second function to use a different function in php through $.post
[19:07:30] <Egahtrac> i know i can simply just make a new php file to have it
[19:07:42] <__joshua___> codepython777:  have you tried i?  looks amd compliant to me
[19:07:47] <__joshua___> jquery, that is
[19:07:58] <codepython777> __joshua___: lemme check
[19:08:02] <Egahtrac> but i'd like to keep the all the php in one file
[19:08:07] <Egahtrac> and access them via $.post
[19:08:31] <codepython777> __joshua___: i dont see a define() in dist/jquery.js
[19:08:42] <__joshua___> last few lines
[19:08:48] <__joshua___> if ( typeof define === "function" && define.amd && define.amd.jQuery ) {define( "jquery", [], function () { return jQuery; } );}
[19:09:00] <__joshua___> what version are you running?
[19:10:06] <__joshua___> Egahtrac: you want to do different posts depending on the state of the button?
[19:10:11] <Egahtrac> yes
[19:10:23] <codepython777> __joshua___: thanks. missed that
[19:10:57] <Egahtrac> so ie the first state will access an isset/if statement that will run until completion and then update the database. If you click it again this will ultimately stop the script and update the database right there
[19:11:13] <Egahtrac> the first part works, the first state will run the php script until completetion and then the database is updated
[19:11:25] <__joshua___> and you want to use the same button?
[19:11:32] <Egahtrac> yes
[19:12:07] <__joshua___> var running = false; Egatrac:  $(button).on('click', function(){ if(!running){ $.post.... }else{other thing } running = !running;});
[19:12:46] <Egahtrac> i'm using $('#id').toggle( function( { });
[19:12:51] <__joshua___> don't
[19:13:00] <Egahtrac> my script doesn't work when i use on('click'
[19:13:04] <Egahtrac> it doesn't run properly
[19:13:30] <__joshua___> look at the docs http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[19:13:41] <__joshua___> toggle doesn't do what you think it does (anymore)
[19:13:50] <Egahtrac> i guess my question is, how do i use $.post to access a specific function in php
[19:13:58] <Egahtrac> without the need for an isset
[19:14:22] <__joshua___> post to a different url
[19:14:30] <Egahtrac> i know that would work
[19:14:40] <Egahtrac> but i don't want to have to post to a different php file for every instance that i use a button to do two things
[19:14:42] <__joshua___> or the same url with a different param
[19:15:13] <Egahtrac> otherwise i'll have a load of php files with like 5 lines in them lol
[19:15:19] <__joshua___> $.post(url, {state: some_state});
[19:16:07] <Egahtrac> and then would i use if (isset($_POST['some_state'])) { argument } in php?
[19:16:35] <__joshua___> or if (isset($_POST['some_state']) && $_POST['some_state'] == x)
[19:16:50] <Egahtrac> what's x
[19:16:50] <__joshua___> er
[19:16:57] <Egahtrac> or do you mean === true?
[19:17:02] <__joshua___>  if (isset($_POST['state']) && $_POST['state'] == x) rather
[19:17:09] <Egahtrac> ooh
[19:17:10] <Egahtrac> right
[19:17:12] <__joshua___> where x is whatever you are looking for
[19:17:19] <__joshua___> state = 'cucumber' or wathver
[19:17:42] <__joshua___> because you have 2 states, a boolean is very suitable
[19:17:45] <Egahtrac> well all i'd really need to do is just get the $_post['some_state'] to be accessed int he php file
[19:17:51] <Egahtrac> it doesn't have to have too many conditions
[19:18:13] <Egahtrac> the script is stopped client side in jquery
[19:18:37] <Egahtrac> all i need to happen on the php side if the script halts from clicking the button again is for hte database to be updated
[19:19:02] <Egahtrac> ill write that out and see if it works
[19:22:15] <Egahtrac> does there have to be a function attached?
[19:22:43] <Egahtrac> or can i just use $.post('phpfile.php', { state:false }
[19:23:09] <Egahtrac> and then use if ($_POST['state'] === false) { }
[19:24:21] <Egahtrac> because i don't need anything to happen further on the client side
[19:24:26] <Egahtrac> so i don't need a jquery function to run
[19:24:36] <Egahtrac> i just need the php function to run
[19:33:33] <Egahtrac> thinking i can just use an $.ajax method but will it work if i don't need a success function
[19:33:46] <Egahtrac> or is there a way to have like a silent success function that doesn't really do anything
[19:51:17] <Egahtrac> got it to work =D
[19:51:24] <Egahtrac> i'm slightly retarded
[19:51:43] <Egahtrac> for some reason i thought the intial call to $_POST['state'] was called from the actual button being clicked
[19:51:59] <Egahtrac> and didn't realize that it's called from the $.post method
[19:52:05] <Egahtrac> so that state: some_state
[19:52:06] <Egahtrac> yeah
[19:52:09] <Egahtrac> i understand now
[19:52:48] <Egahtrac> now i just need a 3rd call to php to execute if the document is closed and bam. my script is complete
[19:53:34] <Egahtrac> most of the most complex programs i've written so far spread across 4 different languages lol

[20:28:25] <narutimateum> hello
[20:53:00] <tapwater> hey guys, I'm trying to learn more about event delegation using .on(). Here's what I have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/U96gV/ could someone tell me if I'm on the right track? I'm thinking of doing this because once in a while when I run ajax calls, the buttons that I replace with the new data no longer has the click event binded to it
[20:53:50] <tapwater> so from what I understand so far, if I bind the click event at the parent element, the inner elements can be dynamically changed but the click event would still be bound
[21:05:35] <narutimateum> hello
[21:51:39] <PurpleDog> I'm trying to build a mobile site using jQuery mobile, and for some reason, the default theme is not "a" and I am not able to change the header theme
[21:52:13] <PurpleDog> I tried <div data-role="header" data-theme="a"> but I still get a light gray header
[21:59:10] <PurpleDog> oh turns out that "b" is the black color, thanks for the help #jquery
[22:11:08] <mouses> i have some simple html that i want to inject from a json file into my page using jquery. whats best practice? "video": [{ "id": 1, "equipment_used":"<span class='highlight'>Camera: </span> BigCameraName"}]...
[22:11:24] <mouses> i know its better to split out the categories into their own properties
[22:12:01] <mouses> but its going to be random from video object to video object, so the lack of consistency will prevent that
[22:12:17] <mouses> i just want to put a span on certain words, so that i can bold them in my css file
[22:13:03] <mouses> should i use entities or just straight html in my js file to be interpretted with $.html()?
[22:13:47] <mouses> i want to make sure it works across browsers... not sure if i should put entities in my js data file or just the regular html
[22:17:42] <mehwork> when i do an $.ajax({..}).done(..); call it's saying (pending) in the network tab. How can i resolve it from the server-side?
[22:25:42] <mogaj> how to use jquery-steps plugin with angularjs? please assist, thankyou
[22:26:30] <tapwater> is there a reason not to use $(this)? Once in a while, I see var thisAlias = $(this) but not sure why it's done.
[22:30:50] <shoky> tapwater: if you're gonna be using it more than once, it's wasteful to keep calling $(..) and creating a new jquery object each time
[22:32:38] <mouses> anybody up?
[22:32:45] <tapwater> shoky got it! thanks
[22:36:19] <mouses> Velveeta, u awake?
[23:32:46] <Parsi> i'm using dynatable plugin, it has a 'records' property, but when I try to use it it says it's undefined
[23:34:35] <mehwork> how do you properly deal with nested ajax calls. Like if a call to /foo returns 404, ajax to /bar?
[23:35:03] <Cork> mehwork: make the second call from the .fail handler of the first one
[23:56:23] <Yahkob> anyone know a way to get the URL.origin with out jquery or js?
[23:56:27] <Yahkob> just pur html5?
[23:58:38] <Cork> Yahkob: html is a markup you can GET anything with it
[23:58:44] <Yahkob> heh
[23:58:54] <Cork> (and html5 is marketing hype and doesn't even mean anything)
[23:59:05] <Yahkob> yeah semantic marketing hype :P
[23:59:09] <Cork> or it means everything, if you prefer
[23:59:18] <Yahkob> I realize its probably very easy but finding pure html stuff is so hard
[23:59:19] <Cork> Yahkob: no
[23:59:38] <Yahkob> so many people are so quick to jump on the "Hey lets make a really long javascript thing to do this" band wagon
[23:59:40] <Yahkob> Cork:  no what?
[23:59:55] <Cork> html5 is <video> css3, animations, canvas, hardare acceleration, web games, web apps, h264...
