[00:00:08] <silv3r_m00n> oh
[00:00:10] <Cork> why?
[00:00:26] <Cork> just do form.serializeArray()
[00:00:38] <Cork> and you will get a nice array with all the values to submit
[00:01:12] <silv3r_m00n> great
[00:01:21] <silv3r_m00n> I was looking for this since 2 days
[00:02:22] <silv3r_m00n> works amazing
[00:04:54] <silv3r_m00n> my form has multiple submit buttons , it even detected the correct submit button which I had pressed , how ?
[00:05:18] <dilvie> silv3r_m00n: magic.
[00:05:49] <dilvie> There are button elves inside your monitor that watch which buttons you press.
[00:06:51] <silv3r_m00n> that's really good
[00:08:11] <silv3r_m00n> no
[00:08:18] <silv3r_m00n> its just selecting the first submit button
[00:08:31] <silv3r_m00n> I just checked the rest of the buttons , it didn't take the 2nd and 3rd one
[00:09:15] <dilvie> the button elves need to take a break once in a while.
[00:09:38] <silv3r_m00n> hmm
[00:10:00] <dilvie> Please ignore me. I should really be asleep. =)
[00:10:37] <silv3r_m00n> and now its selecting all submit buttons
[00:10:57] <silv3r_m00n> Cork : I have 3 submit buttons in a form and serialize is selecting all of them
[00:11:02] <silv3r_m00n> any workaround for them ?
[00:15:07] <dilvie> What do you mean by "selecting"?
[00:16:03] <silv3r_m00n> submit=Save&submit=Save+Select&submit=Edit   its doing that
[00:16:10] <silv3r_m00n> whereas I only need the button that was pressed
[00:18:18] <dilvie> silv3r: you can use .not() to filter out all of the buttons, and then .add() in a click event listener to add the button that was clicked.
[00:20:21] <dilvie> are your buttons real submit buttons?
[00:20:39] <dilvie> According to the docs for serializeArray(), "No submit button value is serialized since the form was not submitted using a button. "
[00:25:27] <KingDosser> Has anyone used the autoResize textarea plugin before?
[00:44:30] <dnsdds> Is there some cool way to toggle between widths? Like, if width is A, make it B, if it's B, make it A?
[00:45:21] <Whirl3d> $(".something").width($(this).width()==A?B:A);
[00:46:50] <Whirl3d> ** not sure if $(this) is scoped correctly now that I look at it, so you could just replace $(this) with your original selector
[00:47:24] <Whirl3d> var something=$("#something"); something.width(something.width()==A?B:A);
[00:51:05] <prema2909> Does anyone know of a good 5 star rating component in JQuery which is read/write?
[00:52:11] <Whirl3d> prema2909, sorry I'm no help there
[00:52:50] <prema2909> Whirl3d: Well signs of life anyway :-) thanks
[00:53:46] <Whirl3d> ikr, I hate it when someone (like myself) says something and a hush falls over the room. Usually coldhead is at least hangin around to provide some morbid imagery or something.
[00:54:35] <Whirl3d> So it's true: coldhead does sleep.... I knew it. lol
[00:55:03] <prema2909> Maybe everyone else is sleeping :-)
[00:55:26] <rethus> is there a way to convert an object into an array?
[00:55:32] <Whirl3d> rethus, yes
[00:55:37] <rethus> .toArray() seems to be only for DOM-Elements?
[00:56:12] <kez> any idea why this snippet doesn't work ?  jQuery('first_obj').html('some content');      jQuery('#dom_elem').after(jQuery('first_obj'));
[00:56:13] <Whirl3d> rethus, what are you trying to do?
[00:56:59] <rethus> i have an object with other objects inside. each of this included object should be transform to an array
[00:57:52] <Whirl3d> for (var prop in object) {myarray.push(oabject[prop])}   or something like that
[00:58:05] <Whirl3d> *object
[00:59:44] <Whirl3d> kez, can you give us the literal text of the snippet.
[01:00:25] <Whirl3d> kez, currently your statement assumes a dom element of class 'first_obj' which doesn't exist
[01:00:57] <kez> oh I see
[01:01:39] <kez> then how would I create an jquery object and apply the html method ?
[01:01:41] <Whirl3d> however, if you did: $(".first_obj")......or $("#first_obj")..... or $(".objectClass").first().... they would work
[01:01:59] <kez> well , I'm not referecing a DOM ob ject
[01:02:08] <kez> I'm trying to create an abstract jquery object
[01:02:31] <kez> as far as I know jQuery('text') isn't a DOM selector
[01:04:04] <Whirl3d> Well, to be honest, I am not familiar with creating a jquery object that doesn't at least represent a dom element (whether it's applied to the dom or not)
[01:04:54] <Whirl3d> In other words, I'm familiar with $("<div id='something'>&nbsp;</div>") to create an unattached div, but not just a regular object
[01:04:59] <kez> yes , this is a real problem with jq , when it comes to dom manipulation it f rules , but otherwise...
[01:05:19] <Whirl3d> Why do you need jquery to do object manipulation...use js
[01:05:47] <Whirl3d> or you could use the $.data() object
[01:06:44] <rethus> Whirl3d: this are the structure of the object:  http://jsfiddle.net/FArxS/1/
[01:07:06] <rethus> wit  this object, i try to feed the Jquery Plugin DataTables
[01:07:56] <Whirl3d> fyi, I'm not familiar with that plugin, so I may not be of much help. I'll try though.
[01:10:20] <nail_> btw, $('text') is a DOM selector for <text> elements
[01:12:19] <Whirl3d> rethus, so what do you want the final output to look like
[01:12:30] <rethus> Whirl3d: the Plugin not the problem for me.... see here... : i only need to add an array instead of an object to $(id).dataTable().fnAddData( n );   http://jsfiddle.net/FArxS/2/
[01:15:00] <Whirl3d> an array of what?
[01:15:29] <kez> I ended up not using jquery at all lol
[01:15:30] <rethus> ech object into obj. as array instead of object
[01:15:32] <kez> ty Whirl , bye
[01:15:37] <Whirl3d> np bye
[01:16:03] <nail_> rethus: see http://jsfiddle.net/FArxS/3/
[01:16:08] <nail_> you get the idea
[01:16:29] <rethus> cool, thanks
[01:20:27] <yan_nick> hey guys, how can i get the last item in a json?
[01:20:45] <j_wright> 'item'?
[01:21:46] <yan_nick> j_wright: element
[01:22:06] <yan_nick> "foo": { first, second }
[01:22:08] <yan_nick> i need first
[01:22:18] <yan_nick> the syntax is wrong but i hope you know what i mean :)
[01:24:18] <j_wright> i thought you wanted second?
[01:24:27] <j_wright> first is the first element
[01:24:59] <yan_nick> j_wright
[01:25:01] <yan_nick> yeah
[01:25:14] <j_wright> just pop it from your array once you've decoded the json
[01:26:50] <j_wright> yourjsonobject.foo.pop()
[01:27:57] <yan_nick> j_wright: pop() in js?!
[01:28:17] <j_wright> what language were you expecting?
[01:28:33] <j_wright> yes pop() is a method on arrays in javascript
[01:31:08] <j_wright> or jsonobject.foo.slice(-1) if you don't want to remove the elementt
[01:31:58] <yan_nick> j_wright++
[01:35:48] <rethus> how can i unset an object inside of another opject.
[01:36:14] <rethus> only obj.speaker=null; ?
[01:39:26] <j_wright> delete obj["speaker"]; ?
[01:40:03] <j_wright> that removes it, your question was pretty vague
[01:46:33] <dimitris5> can you help me with this? http://home.dakulov.eu:85/ituts.gr/  In the slider appear some scrollbars, but they shouldnt

[03:36:39] <codepal> Nyon, cginschool.co.uk doesn't resolve...
[03:36:50] <dbugger> Hey guys
[03:37:05] <rethus> are there predefined css in ui-themeroller for even and odd tr-Tags?
[03:37:14] <codepal> Nyon, that's probably the reason your getting: Receiving end does not exist.
[03:37:26] <dbugger> Can someone please tell me why my indicator on my menu isnt turning red? http://goo.gl/jlM29 (script.js in line 131 is the instruction)
[03:38:59] <Nyon> Cheers codepal , I'll do some digging :D
[03:40:59] <codepal> Nyon, mtr is giving me a trace... but ping's are getting no-replies.
[03:42:10] <Aamir> rethus:  no
[03:43:02] <Aamir> rethus:  you can try  tr. even.ui-state-default { background:none; } or something like that
[03:43:35] <rethus> means there are no predefined colorset for this?
[03:43:58] <rethus> which existing one could be used?
[03:44:48] <Nyon> codepal any chance this could be a server setting? Perhaps it's blocking the request?
[03:46:08] <codepal> Nyon, it's blocking all http requests isn't - you've tried point your browser at http://www.cginschool.co.uk/ ??
[03:46:35] <logik-bomb> If I'm using the same selector over and over, would it be better to cache that object?
[03:46:40] <logik-bomb> into a var?
[03:46:42] <logik-bomb> thanks
[03:47:05] <Nyon> codepal, yeah. I can access the website perfectly fine.
[03:47:26] <Aamir> rethus: there is on predefined
[03:47:40] <Aamir> rethus: assign ui-state-default to all tr
[03:47:49] <Nyon> the RSS request would be coming over port 80 wouldn't it(sorry for the super n00b questions)
[03:47:52] <rethus> how can i do this?
[03:48:00] <Aamir> and than change bg colour etc for .even or .odd class

[04:24:30] <juria_roberts> Anticom: I do not know the id of the colorpicker
[04:24:48] <Anticom> then use the class instead
[04:24:50] <Anticom> or set one
[04:24:56] <Kingsy> Anticom: don't suppose you could offer some advice on my issue could ya?
[04:25:11] <Anticom> Kingsy what issue?
[04:25:16] <Kingsy> sorry umm
[04:25:22] <juria_roberts> anticom thanks
[04:25:26] <Anticom> ur welcome
[04:25:28] <Kingsy> why wouldnt this work --> jQuery('.seo-more').click(function() {jQuery('.more-content').slideToggle('fast', function() { });}); <-- in IE ?
[04:25:39] <Kingsy> you can see it here.. http://www.qpjewellers.com/shopby/earrings.html <--- in IE click the "MORE ABOUT OUR RANGE OF EARRINGS" at the top.. in FF it slides. in IE it kinda bumps down then up
[04:25:52] <Kingsy> sorry I think you joined after I asked
[04:26:08] <Anticom> sec
[04:26:14] <Kingsy> np
[04:28:31] <Anticom> try css float:left; for <div class="col-left sidebar"> as well Kingsy
[04:28:58] <Kingsy> Anticom: the col-left isnt anything to do with the issue tho is it?
[04:29:15] <Kingsy> Anticom: sorry what you do mean aswell ? did i miss something?
[04:29:33] <Anticom> in my ie the nav gets pulled down, when i slide your panel down
[04:29:44] <Anticom> using IE6 ;)
[04:29:47] <Anticom> otherwise you could try to fix it by using <br clear="both"/> ...i know it's ugly but it might fix your problem
[04:30:00] <Kingsy> Anticom: we don't support IE6
[04:30:08] <Anticom> and in IE6 it in deed is a little bumpier, but it slides
[04:30:21] <Anticom> did you try slide("slow" ??
[04:30:24] <Anticom> just for testing purpose
[04:30:37] <Anticom> maybe it's just because js-engine is 2slow in IE
[04:30:48] <Kingsy> Anticom: its not that its bumpy its that its sliding down than back up
[04:30:55] <Kingsy> Anticom: could you try it out in IE7 or 8 ?
[04:30:56] <Anticom> in IE6 it is not
[04:31:05] <Anticom> nop, don't got IE6
[04:31:16] <Anticom> must preserve it, because we do support it and i need it for testing
[04:31:39] <Kingsy> ah.. yeah we chucked it out the window. the man hours it was taking to support it wasnt worth it
[04:31:48] <Kingsy> in our model anyways
[04:33:04] <jamk> hi, i am trying to work with jquery image annotations on my photoshop images

[05:06:57] <xeranas> nice

[05:07:39] <Anticom> can i use data: function() {...}, in $.ajax?
[05:08:40] <Anticom> i mean the functions callback as data value?
[05:19:28] <sadmicrowave> Anticom, you can test it by placing function(){ return 'MyDataSet'; } in the data: option
[05:19:42] <Anticom> found another way already, but thanks
[05:19:46] <sadmicrowave> on
[05:19:47] <sadmicrowave> ok*
[05:21:36] <sadmicrowave> Guest47092, they are a day old though
[05:22:11] <AdvoWork> if ive got various elements with the class dblclick  how can i replace it with "noclass"
[05:23:10] <qwerty57> how do you assign css id to .this?
[05:23:14] <sadmicrowave> AdvoWork, $('.dblclick').removeClass('.dblclick').addClass('.noclass')
[05:23:32] <sadmicrowave> AdvoWork, also, there is a 'replaceClass' plugin see ?replaceClass
[05:23:33] <bot-t> AdvoWork, replaceClass | jQuery Plugins - This jQuery plugin replaces one class with another on hover or click. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/replaceClass
[05:23:39] <timbreck> sadmicrowave: without the . in the last two arguments i think
[05:23:57] <sadmicrowave> indeed, sorry
[05:24:00] <sadmicrowave> ^^
[05:24:28] <sadmicrowave> qwerty57, what do you mean by 'css id' ?
[05:24:44] <sadmicrowave> you mean a DOM id?
[05:24:50] <AdvoWork> cheers sadmicrowave
[05:25:20] <qwerty57> id so later i can if ($(this).is("#button")) {
[05:25:46] <sadmicrowave> qwerty57, then you mean just a regular element id, 'css id' confused me.
[05:25:56] <esKju> hi there :)
[05:26:17] <sadmicrowave> qwerty57, $(this).attr('mynewid', 'myidvalue');
[05:26:36] <esKju> ist there a possibility to request the belonging form of a input?`
[05:26:36] <qwerty57> great, thanks!
[05:27:08] <sadmicrowave> esKju, which do you want, the name, id, or class of a form?
[05:27:15] <timbreck> esKju: $("#myinpu").closest("form"); ?
[05:27:32] <esKju> in the best case: the object :)
[05:27:35] <sadmicrowave> ++timbreck, that was my next statement exactly
[05:27:39] <esKju> ah, very nice timbreck, thx!
[05:27:52] <timbreck> :)
[05:28:35] <AdvoWork> ive got $(".dblclick").bind("click", function() { // stff } but i want to disable that from somewhere else, can i somehow unbind?

[05:31:57] <Karric> Hey everyone, quick jquery quetion: I'm trying to store the number of siblings an element has in a variable. How would i do this?
[05:36:20] <blacksoul> hey, using this http://pastebin.com/tSajtUvU source code, it doesnt works anymore (after updating jquery)
[05:36:29] <blacksoul> any idea what to change?
[05:38:05] <esKju> timbreck: works perfectly - i display 2 or more forms at a single page and by pressing ctrl + s i submit the active one :)
[05:38:37] <erichynds> Karric: $("#foo").siblings().length
[05:38:37] <bot-t> (8 hours 12 mins ago) <coldhead> tell erichynds NO YOU'RE THE SUBHUMAN, RACIST
[05:39:52] <timbreck> blacksoul: maybe it's in the my_confirm() function ?
[05:40:04] <timbreck> blacksoul: can we see the code for that?
[05:40:22] <blacksoul> of course, but i didnt get an errror, that the function is missing in firefox
[05:40:40] <blacksoul> it just didnt get called, i think
[05:40:50] <blacksoul> http://pastebin.com/GE5bQpgk
[05:42:05] <esKju> use document.location.href
[05:42:31] <esKju> do you have a online version of your code?
[05:42:42] <esKju> a executable one :)
[05:43:06] <blacksoul> not yet, but i can form one, give me 2 minutes
[05:43:15] <esKju> kk, np
[05:43:42] <blacksoul> jsfiddle isnt loading..?
[05:43:52] <blacksoul> ah now
[05:44:40] <AdvoWork> eml, i dont get what you mean?
[05:45:53] <AdvoWork> cant i just do $(".dblclick").unbind("click"); ?
[05:46:33] <blacksoul> well..
[05:46:38] <blacksoul> http://jsfiddle.net/jQuUT/3/
[05:46:40] <blacksoul> here it works...

[05:48:00] <timbreck> AdvoWork: you can, but it then ubinds any function you bound to click, sometimes you just want to unbind a specific one.
[05:48:18] <timbreck> blacksoul: browser cache issue ?
[05:48:19] <Flower21> Hi, i have a simple question. I want to add opacity to image when i mouse hover. I know how to do this only on the image i hover. But i want the opacity on all the image exept the one im hovering
[05:48:25] <Flower21> $(this).stop().animate({ opacity: 0.0 }, 500);
[05:48:27] <blacksoul> Does the code $(document) and so on has to be in the head, or would it be possible to put it also in the content?
[05:48:33] <Anticom> what the fuck... my custom layout juts didn't work, because i called the class of the input fields 'autosuggest' o__O
[05:48:34] <Flower21>  is this something like $(*).stop().animate({ opacity: 1.0 }, 500);
[05:48:41] <blacksoul> timbreck: couldnt be, because more than 1 user has this problem
[05:48:46] <erichynds> Flower21: $("#container img").not(this).animate()
[05:48:53] <AdvoWork> timbreck, well it doesnt seem to unbind/i can still double click and it still runs that function :S
[05:49:54] <erichynds> Flower21: i can help you in here..
[05:50:15] <Flower21> ok thanks but where exactly should i add this line
[05:50:28] <erichynds> ?p @ Flower21
[05:50:29] <bot-t> Flower21, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:50:29] <timbreck> AdvoWork: the event for double click is dblciick
[05:50:30] <Flower21> after this : $(this).hover(function() {
[05:50:37] <Flower21> ??
[05:50:39] <timbreck> AdvoWork: dblclick sorry
[05:51:21] <Flower21> http://jsfiddle.net/fYLAb/
[05:51:32] <Flower21> my code is there
[05:52:09] <AdvoWork> timbreck, ive done $('.dblclick').removeClass('dblclick');$(".dblclick").unbind("click"); but still it allows me to double click/edit
[05:52:48] <timbreck> AdvoWork: to unbind 2xclick, use $(".dblclick").unbind("dblclick");
[05:52:55] <erichynds> Flower21: http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/fYLAb/1/
[05:53:45] <timbreck> AdvoWork: and since you removed the class, it's normal the $(".dblclick") doesnt return anything
[05:53:51] <Flower21> thanks a lot erichynds !
[05:54:04] <Flower21> erichynds++
[05:54:05] <timbreck> AdvoWork: try doinf the unbind before the removeclass
[05:54:07] <blacksoul> Does the code $(document) and so on has to be in the head, or would it be possible to put it also in the content?
[05:55:16] <Anticom> $(this)parents('tr:first').find('.autofirma').val(ui.item.firma); jslint and ff-console is telling me, a semicolon was missing... but where?!
[05:55:27] <Anticom> zomg.. sorry
[05:56:02] <erichynds> blacksoul: yeah it's possible
[05:56:19] <blacksoul> k
[05:56:59] <AdvoWork> timbreck, thats got it, cheers :)
[05:58:10] <blacksoul> lets ask another question: i have $("idelement").autocomplete in my code; all js code in 1 file (its not much, just 5 function and 3 with autocomplete) and i include this .js in every document (index template) ... how can i avoid the error, that "idelement" is not given?
[05:59:31] <fuchstronaut> var elm = $('idelement') if (elm.length) { /*your code */}
[06:01:30] <blacksoul> fuchstronaut: thanks for that
[06:01:43] <glen1> hey
[06:01:55] <esKju> hi glen1
[06:02:53] <glen1> im trying to use a toggle, like when you click the same element this happens, and when you click it again something else happens
[06:04:46] <esKju> $("#myObject").click(function(e) { $(this).css("opacity",($(this).css("opacity") == 0 ? 1 : 0)); }); <- something like this?
[06:09:47] <glen1> esKju, i think ill try that thanks man
[06:12:35] <sadmicrowave> esKju, do you need the event callback in the function?
[06:12:43] <sadmicrowave> 'e'?
[06:17:17] <KuW8t> data = $('.TextMBlack').parents('table:first').html(data);      the data.length show me a 0        ... but why!?! there is a hit on the class TextMBlack! what happens here!?! heeEeelp xD
[06:19:01] <kborchers> KuW8t: that statement would try to add data to the html of the selected elements. if you are trying to "get" the html, just do .html()
[06:20:03] <KuW8t> but my html stack is in dta
[06:20:07] <KuW8t> *data
[06:20:14] <blacksoul> ah
[06:20:17] <blacksoul> i found the error
[06:20:32] <kborchers> KuW8t: maybe i'm confused, what are you trying to do with that statement?
[06:20:59] <KuW8t> get the table out of the html stack in the var data
[06:21:09] <blacksoul> is my http://jsfiddle.net/jQuUT/4/ function didnt work, because the ("otherElement").autocomplete throught an error (element was missing) and thats why my delete function wasnt executed / set, i dont know...
[06:21:15] <blacksoul> is there a way to avoid this?
[06:22:15] <kborchers> KuW8t: is data a jquery object?
[06:23:24] <KuW8t> yes i think
[06:23:57] <kborchers> KuW8t: so you want to get the table out of data and set data to that table?
[06:24:12] <KuW8t> no only get out the table.
[06:24:27] <kborchers> KuW8t: and do what with it?
[06:24:27] <KuW8t> first only get it
[06:24:50] <KuW8t> shot it
[06:24:55] <KuW8t> *show it
[06:25:06] <kborchers> KuW8t: and .TextMBlack is in data or your page?
[06:25:16] <KuW8t> in data
[06:26:05] <KuW8t> in data is a table with a td who use the classname TextMBlack
[06:26:51] <kborchers> KuW8t: try data.find(".TextMBlack").closest("table") that will give you an object containing the table, then you can add it to your page
[06:27:24] <KuW8t> data = data.find(".TextMBlack").closest("table")
[06:27:26] <KuW8t> like this?
[06:27:46] <kborchers> that's what i asked earlier, so you're trying to reset data as the table that you found?
[06:28:05] <kborchers> that won't put it in your page though
[06:29:53] <KuW8t> yes reset it
[06:30:08] <KuW8t> and then i send data on my page
[06:31:02] <kborchers> KuW8t: then do  data = data.find(".TextMBlack").closest("table").html(); and return that in your function
[06:31:09] <kborchers> no wait
[06:32:35] <kborchers> if you need the table tags as well, you need to do data = data.find(".TextMBlack").closest("table").clone();
[06:32:38] <KuW8t> data find is not a function i get back
[06:33:13] <sadmicrowave> KuW8t, are you sure data is what you think it is?
[06:33:17] <kborchers> data is not a jquery object
[06:33:28] <KuW8t> :\
[06:34:29] <kborchers> looking at your code, it looks like it's JSON.
[06:35:08] <esKju> is there a function like keyCodeToChar?
[06:35:15] <kborchers> is data.results[0] html?
[06:35:41] <kborchers> have you logged it to see what's in there?
[06:36:05] <KuW8t> yes
[06:36:19] <kborchers> ok, then try $(data).find....
[06:36:20] <KuW8t> its html
[06:36:30] <KuW8t> k
[06:36:36] <sadmicrowave> :D
[06:37:01] <KuW8t> worked
[06:37:06] <KuW8t> n1
[06:38:00] <sadmicrowave> (B{) <- does that look like a cop wearing aviators to anyone else?
[06:40:04] <xeranas> is there exist differece where in body place jquery code? For me it wont work jquery code which change form input if jquery code was added before form (it works after i move it down after form).. I bit comfused why in same <body> section script place have meaning..
[06:40:47] <jbrokc> what would be the animation to flash an elements background a couple of times? $.animate(function() { "opacity": "toggle" } ) ?
[06:41:43] <kborchers> xeranas: because js can't modify the dom until it is ready.
[06:42:16] <sadmicrowave> xeranas, if you place your js in $(document).ready(function(){ }); inside your html at the top (before your form) it should work.  The problem (i think) is that when you have the js at the top of your page, the DOM elements for that form have not been loaded yet, so it has nothing to modify.
[06:42:30] <sadmicrowave> yea, what kborchers said
[06:42:48] <kborchers> yea, what sadmicrowave said ;)
[06:42:53] <sadmicrowave> hah
[06:42:56] <xeranas> thank you, it make sence
[06:43:36] <sadmicrowave> jbrokc, maybe a setInterval loop
[06:43:38] <Ankabout> how can I slowly change the margin on an element so it seems to be sliding slowly?
[06:43:51] <KuW8t> kborchers: big thx to you!
[06:43:52] <Ankabout> basically on hover the margin should slowly go from 20px to 0
[06:43:58] <kborchers> KuW8t: np
[06:44:14] <KuW8t> learned much
[06:44:17] <sadmicrowave> anakron, $(this).animate({left: '0px'}, slow);
[06:44:20] <timbreck> Ankabout: using .animate() ?
[06:44:34] <sadmicrowave> or is it -20px?
[06:44:43] <Ankabout> it's 20 and needs to go to 0
[06:44:54] <Ankabout> alright, lemme try
[06:45:04] <KuW8t> kborchers: is it also possible to modify the elements now?
[06:45:10] <timbreck> .animate({ border-width: 0px }) ??
[06:45:28] <garbagegod> im using easyslider 1.7 and i need a way to customize the output
[06:45:33] <sadmicrowave> anakron, no, I'm trying to remember if .animate() needs absolute placement values from its current location or if it can reference the parent element position values
[06:45:47] <garbagegod> it outputs an ordered list with the number but i want it to include some text too
[06:45:55] <kborchers> KuW8t: sure, once you have your clone, it is a jQuery object so you can do what ever manipulation on them you want, or you can manipulate them after you add them to the dom. either way
[06:46:00] <garbagegod> since it modifies it on the DOM level i cant figure out a way to do it :(
[06:46:11] <sadmicrowave> timbreck, won't that increase the border-top and bottom and right also?
[06:46:31] <KuW8t> kborchers: craazyy! begin to love that jquery stuff
[06:46:48] <Ankabout> timbreck I can't use margin-top in there?
[06:46:50] <timbreck> sadmicrowave: sorry i missed a part of the questio nthen :p
[06:46:59] <kborchers> KuW8t: it's a nice little library ;)
[06:47:04] <Ankabout> $(this).animate({margin-top: '0px'}, slow);
[06:47:23] <Ankabout> or do I need quotes?
[06:47:25] <sadmicrowave> Ankabout, you want it to animate up AND left?
[06:47:32] <Ankabout> only up
[06:47:37] <timbreck> Ankabout: you can use any CSS that uses units as a value for its property
[06:47:38] <sadmicrowave> oh, sorry
[06:47:41] <garbagegod> http://pastebin.com/w0mW7qY9 im pretty sure this is the function can you guys halp me :3
[06:47:52] <sadmicrowave> anakron, $(this).animate({top: '0px'}, slow)
[06:48:25] <sadmicrowave> anakron, but if you use '-' in a css property it has to be quoted and can't be inside {}
[06:48:54] <Ankabout> timbreck, so I need quotes then?  $(this).animate({'margin-top': '0px'}, slow);
[06:49:04] * sadmicrowave feels invisible
[06:49:19] <Ankabout> oh sorry, you pinged ana.kron :)
[06:49:21] <Ankabout> didn't see, sorry
[06:49:50] <Ankabout> so what would the syntax be if I want to use margin-top then?
[06:50:01] <sadmicrowave> juse use top: '0px'
[06:50:10] <sadmicrowave> the 'margin' is implied
[06:51:36] <Ankabout> hmmm not working yet... lemme try something
[06:53:06] <esKju> Ankabout + timbreck: there are some IE issues concerning animate method and margin
[06:53:15] <Ankabout> I'm using chrome
[06:53:26] <Ankabout> but it might be a targeting issue at this stage...
[06:53:27] <timbreck> esKju: really? some IE issues? :):):)
[06:53:35] <esKju> :D
[06:53:35] <Ankabout> what can I throw in the .hover function to test?
[06:53:59] <sadmicrowave> alert( 'in the hover function' );
[06:54:17] <logik-bomb> console.log('works');
[06:54:20] <jbrokc> $("input#foo").focus() highlights all the text in the input field. How do I just place the cursor at the end, with no text highlighted?
[06:54:28] <Ankabout> a-ha!
[06:56:13] <roger_padactor> Hello, How do you prevent the browser in fetching an image when the contents have been cloned but not put back in? Im taking the cloned html cleaning it out and then saving the html to the server. But once I clone it it goes and grabs the image again. wasting resorces.
[06:58:24] <sadmicrowave> roger_padactor, perhaps .clone(false)
[06:58:42] <Ankabout> sadmicrowave, anything wrong with this: $(".view-project-overview .views-field-title").hover(function() {
[06:59:15] <sadmicrowave> Ankabout, can you make a pastebin of the entire hover function?
[06:59:21] <Ankabout> sure
[06:59:22] <sadmicrowave> because nothing looks wrong with that
[06:59:46] <Ankabout> http://pastebin.com/wfNEdnKM
[07:00:02] <sadmicrowave> Ankabout, are .view-project-overview and .views-field-title 2 separate elements are is -title a child of -overview?
[07:00:35] <Ankabout> -title is a child
[07:00:37] <Ankabout> but not direct
[07:00:42] <sadmicrowave> ok
[07:00:50] <Ankabout> more like a grandchild
[07:00:54] <Ankabout> :)
[07:01:17] <sadmicrowave> is it .views and not .view?
[07:01:56] <juria_roberts> Has anyone tried slideUp inside a table seems to be a pain?
[07:02:36] <kborchers> Ankabout: if it's a "grandchild", that won't work. you'll need to do $(".view-project-overview").find(".views-field-title").hover(function() {
[07:03:01] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, Ankabout or just $('.views-field-title')
[07:03:19] <robotriot> ok dudes. im trying to make a dialog from a reference to siblings.. but it doesnt want to respond to the click handler.. here's my code http://jsfiddle.net/WwQLH/1/
[07:03:29] <Ankabout> sadmicrowave:  http://pastebin.com/sLBeedpT
[07:03:40] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: unless you want to limit it to the -title's inside of -overview
[07:03:46] <sadmicrowave> exactly
[07:03:50] <Ankabout> ahh ok
[07:03:59] <sadmicrowave> i was about to say that too, after I mentioned it I thought it through
[07:04:42] <Ankabout> nope, doesn't work with the find
[07:04:50] <sadmicrowave> Ankabout, the ad in your pastebin wants me to see if I will have an ugly baby by viewing their uglybabycalculator
[07:04:51] <sadmicrowave> lmao
[07:05:03] <Ankabout> hahaha
[07:05:08] <Ankabout> I didn't choose the ad ;)
[07:05:17] <sadmicrowave> i know i just think its funny
[07:05:50] <timbreck> sadmicrowave: so, will you have an uglu baby?
[07:05:57] <timbreck> ugly******
[07:06:58] <sadmicrowave> timbreck, I can say that I already have a good looking baby (but thats a parent talking about their baby)
[07:07:22] <Ankabout> so that doesn't make sense
[07:07:30] <Ankabout> I even tried $(".view-project-overview .view-content .views-row .views-field-title").hover(function() {
[07:07:34] <Ankabout> doens't detect the hover
[07:07:41] <Ankabout> that's all the relatives included
[07:07:41] <Ankabout> haha
[07:07:44] <greytrilby> when loading a request using ajax, I want to return just one div from the page and put the html in the div on my current page. The code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/CVynT/ - it's just not working - I know i'm missing something obvious!
[07:08:13] <lacrymology> hello. I'm trying to set a background picture the size of the whole document.. it's proving surprisingly difficult. Can't be done by css and doing $(function(){$("img#bg").height(document.height)}) has shown me that at ready() time the document is higher than it is afterwards..
[07:08:24] <sadmicrowave> Ankabout, are they live added elements?
[07:08:30] <Ankabout> nope
[07:08:30] <greytrilby> I do it in other pages using "load("page.php" + "myDiv") - i just can't get it to work with the returned element from the page call
[07:08:55] <Ankabout> and I've actually targetted grandchildren in other functions and that works fine
[07:09:20] <greytrilby> @lacrymology - have you tried using "window.height()?"
[07:09:36] <sadmicrowave> Ankabout, isn't the class of the topmost parent actually "view view-project-overview view-id-project_overview view-display-id-page view-dom-id-1" ?
[07:09:46] <sadmicrowave> not just view-project-overview
[07:09:56] <Ankabout> no there are spaces inbetween
[07:10:03] <Ankabout> so each one is a separate class
[07:11:08] <kborchers> robotriot: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/WwQLH/4/
[07:11:33] <Ankabout> hmm targeting is working
[07:11:36] <Ankabout> it's hovering that's not working
[07:11:45] <roger_padactor> sadmicrowave:  nope
[07:11:48] <Ankabout> I can use .addclass when it's targetted
[07:11:49] <robotriot> kborchers: i did that originally, BUT you can't open it once it's closed
[07:12:22] <sadmicrowave> Ankabout, I'm making a fiddle, hold on
[07:12:28] <sadmicrowave> roger_padactor, sorry then dude, I don't know
[07:13:12] <Ankabout> sadmicrowave, no prob, but just FYI,  $(".view-project-overview .views-field-title").addClass(""); works fine
[07:14:01] <sadmicrowave> Ankabout, oh, sorry dude, 'slow' needs to be in quotes
[07:14:35] <Ankabout> ahhhh thanks
[07:14:46] <Ankabout> and that was causing an error, causing the popup not to work either
[07:14:47] <sadmicrowave> Ankabout, do you  not have the web developers toolbar?
[07:14:47] <Ankabout> thanks!
[07:14:53] <Ankabout> using chrome
[07:14:59] <sadmicrowave> ok
[07:15:22] <sadmicrowave> you can sub 'slow' for millisecond values like 500 is half a second
[07:16:24] <roger_padactor> how would you prevent the browser from loading an image when the src changes
[07:17:21] <mythmon> if I type a * in a form, and then $(form).serialize() and do an ajax call with that, Jquery isn't escaping the *, so things break. Help?
[07:17:53] <lacrymology> any clues why is it that on $(document).ready() the document's height is different than it is afterwards?
[07:17:53] <timbreck> roger_padactor: i don't think you can do that
[07:17:54] <sadmicrowave> roger_padactor, what about .clone().find('img').attr('src','')
[07:18:09] <timbreck> well yeah if you clone it sure
[07:18:17] <timbreck> but thats not *the* image
[07:18:36] <sadmicrowave> lol, timbreck thats what he was talking about earlier, cloning a parent and making the child image not load
[07:18:40] <Ankabout> excellent, works perfecly!
[07:18:45] <sadmicrowave> Ankabout, good
[07:18:51] <Ankabout> thanks sadmicrowave!
[07:18:53] <roger_padactor> i still want the link in the src in the clone but I don't want it to add it to the dom so it shouldn't fetch the image yet
[07:19:16] <kborchers> robotriot: try this http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/WwQLH/5/
[07:19:22] <timbreck> roger_padactor: can you move the value of the src to enother attribute until you want it to load?
[07:20:09] <amirite> whats the right way to checkmark a radio box with jquery
[07:20:11] <sadmicrowave> roger_padactor, yea, I wish .load() accepted bool options like 'false' because that would be what you want
[07:20:20] <roger_padactor> timbreck: im getting the html() of the clone to post to the server.
[07:20:29] <mythmon> amirite: $(checkbox).prop('checked', true)
[07:20:34] <smplstk> ?checkboxes @ amirite
[07:20:34] <bot-t> amirite, As of jQuery 1.6, use .prop("checked") to test checked, and .prop("checked", true or false) to change the state. In jQuery 1.5 you could check the box with .attr("checked","checked") and to uncheck it, do .removeAttr("checked")
[07:20:43] <roger_padactor> yeah. I want the html in the clone but i really dont need it to add it to the dom.
[07:20:45] <sadmicrowave> amirite, one way is $('input').attr('checked', 'checked')
[07:21:00] <amirite> what does the .prop method do differently from the .attr method
[07:21:01] <sadmicrowave> amirite, but I like mythmon's way better
[07:21:07] <lacrymology> ?height
[07:21:07] <kborchers> robotriot: actually, try this. it should do a better job of cleaning up those clones so they aren't just sitting there in your html http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/WwQLH/6/
[07:21:08] <bot-t> .height(): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/height/
[07:21:26] <sadmicrowave> amirite, .prop changes element properties without having to add an attribute
[07:21:26] <amirite> i remember that .attr('checked' was a pain in the ass, which is why i came in here to ask before i tried
[07:21:33] <roger_padactor> cuz now all i get are 404 errors and its bothering me. it doesn't effect anything. ya know
[07:21:51] <amirite> thanks myth, sad
[07:22:12] <stockz> Hey guys, I am just too handsome, amirite ?
[07:22:34] <sadmicrowave> roger_padactor, did my last suggestion not work?
[07:22:58] <juria_roberts> why is slideup not smooth for tables?
[07:23:12] <juria_roberts> unlike div which is as smooth as james bond
[07:23:25] <robotriot> kborchers: thank you!
[07:23:25] <kborchers> juria_roberts: because table layouts suck ;)
[07:23:32] <kborchers> robotriot: np
[07:23:33] <sadmicrowave> juria_roberts, what element are you selecting in your slideup function?
[07:23:49] <juria_roberts> sadmicrowave: td
[07:24:17] <roger_padactor> sadmicrowave: this is what im doing. http://pastebin.com/NxJLyAmD  but as soon as that src gets changed i get the 404040404
[07:24:22] <sadmicrowave> juria_roberts, lets think this through, each td will slideup, then it will hit the border of the tr and do what? look like shit is what
[07:24:56] <juria_roberts> sadmicrowave: is there an alternative to slideUp then?
[07:25:02] <roger_padactor> the console.log part would actually be sent to the server.
[07:25:13] <sadmicrowave> juria_roberts, maybe try sliding the $('td, tr')
[07:25:28] <sadmicrowave> or just the tr
[07:25:31] <timbreck> roger_padactor: the __MEDIA_PATH__  variable is defined somewhere, right ?
[07:25:38] <rethus> how can i add some text to the next div inside of divv with id "asdf" ?
[07:25:40] <juria_roberts> sadmicrowave: wait ill fiddle and show u my table
[07:25:53] <rethus> $("#asdf").first-child() ?
[07:26:12] <sadmicrowave> rethus, yes
[07:26:21] <mythmon> or $("#asdf").children('div').first() if there is more than divs.
[07:26:42] <roger_padactor> timbreck:  It's not supposed to be a valid src as far as the page is concerned. but when the data gets taken from the db it gets changed to something that works
[07:27:20] <kborchers> mythmon: rethus; or $("#asdf").children('div:first')
[07:27:23] <roger_padactor> in works. our who gives a sh*^%t because its not supposed to be in the dom
[07:27:49] <juria_roberts> sadmicrowave: http://jsfiddle.net/kVprV/
[07:27:59] <rethus> i realy wonder, why there is no possibility to add some Text to Table-Headline of DataTables-Plugin
[07:28:01] <juria_roberts> sadmicrowave: its a nested table
[07:28:16] <sadmicrowave> roger_padactor, what if you took the src value, assigned it to a variable, then deleted the src attribute, and put the src variable string into another attribute?
[07:28:55] <roger_padactor> sadmicrowave: i need it in the src.
[07:29:01] <sadmicrowave> why?
[07:29:16] <mythmon> roger_padactor: if it is in the src, no matter what you do the browser will attempt to load and render the image.
[07:29:20] <roger_padactor> because that is what gets parsed on the way out
[07:29:24] <timbreck> roger_padactor: if your element is in the dom, and you don't want to move the value out of the src attribute, it will load
[07:29:28] <mythmon> roger_padactor: sounds like a bad parser.
[07:29:43] <sadmicrowave> roger_padactor, so tell your parser to parse the new attribute you create for it instead of src
[07:30:03] <roger_padactor> i was hoping I wouldn't have to :)
[07:30:11] <sadmicrowave> nope, you have to
[07:30:22] <greytrilby> on ajax success I want the html loaded into the div to be just the contents of one div on the processing page. Is this possible? I have code here, but it's just bringing in the full page, not the bit of the page I want http://jsfiddle.net/CVynT/
[07:30:23] <roger_padactor> awesome.
[07:30:27] <roger_padactor> oh well
[07:30:46] <sadmicrowave> roger_padactor, whats the problem with it loading the image? why don't you want it to?
[07:31:11] <sadmicrowave> juria_roberts, so, its just not doing anything?
[07:31:18] <amirite> anyone have experience with FOUT
[07:31:36] <sadmicrowave> get the F-OUT
[07:31:49] <juria_roberts> sadmicrowave: it was in my pc
[07:32:08] <juria_roberts> sadmicrowave: i dunno how to fiddle with jsfidddle (pun intented)
[07:33:04] <roger_padactor> gives me 404's im trying to get the table contents, strip crap from it and save it to the db. dont want to store full path urls in the db so using __MEDIA_PATH__ and parsing that solves the problem.  I guess ill just change the parser to look for rel as well
[07:33:19] <sadmicrowave> juria_roberts, http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/kVprV/1/
[07:33:57] <juria_roberts> sadmicrowave: yeah it works but it doesnt slide :(
[07:34:00] <sadmicrowave> roger_padactor, can you just set display:none once you clone it and don't worry if it gives you 404's or not
[07:34:05] <juria_roberts> sadmicrowave: and its jerky
[07:34:34] <dundan> hello everyone, could anyone please tell me why does this one does not work? http://jsfiddle.net/p4FAB/
[07:35:20] <juria_roberts> sadmicrowave: now see this its so smooth http://jsfiddle.net/kVprV/2/
[07:35:48] <greytrilby> @dundan - I thought ":contains" was just for forms?
[07:35:50] <sadmicrowave> right, I understand, it has something to do with tables
[07:36:05] <kenthree> is there a one-liner way to modify "Text" only in <div>Text <span>other</span></div> ?
[07:36:19] <juria_roberts> sadmicrowave: so how do i get the same effect for tables?
[07:36:29] <sadmicrowave> juria_roberts, trying to figure it out for you
[07:36:42] <juria_roberts> sadmicrowave: thanks mate
[07:37:09] <dundan> @graytrilby: http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/ <--- no :)
[07:37:20] <greytrilby> @dundan - just realised that
[07:37:28] <greytrilby> you're missing a $( at the beginning
[07:37:36] <Woet> juria_roberts: why is it a table?
[07:38:12] <juria_roberts> Woet: cause i coded in php using table and now they want it to have that slideUp
[07:38:22] <Woet> juria_roberts: is it tabular data?
[07:38:33] <dundan> @graytrilby where?
[07:38:35] <juria_roberts> Woet: no
[07:38:39] <Woet> juria_roberts: then don't use tables :)
[07:38:44] <timbreck> dundan: it works for me
[07:38:45] <greytrilby> dundan - sorry, I misread your code.
[07:38:49] <greytrilby> could it be the case sensitivity?
[07:38:51] <juria_roberts> Woet: but i already did :(
[07:38:52] <timbreck> dundan: chose jquery on the left :p
[07:38:57] <Woet> juria_roberts: tables are meant for tabular data, not for markup or design.
[07:39:01] <juria_roberts> Woet: i didnt have the foresight
[07:39:03] <Woet> juria_roberts: animations aren't supported on tables
[07:39:03] <greytrilby> youv'e put "Contains" instead of "contains"
[07:39:05] <Woet> "Table rows present particular obstacles to animation, since browsers use different values (table-row and block) for their visible display property. The .hide() and .show() methods, without animation, are always safe to use with table rows. As of jQuery version 1.1.3, .fadeIn() and .fadeOut() can be used as well."
[07:39:09] <rethus> are in js exist a function like exit in php?
[07:39:14] <dundan> yeah i have, it doesn't work for me :(
[07:39:27] <dundan> both elements are displayed
[07:39:29] <timbreck> on yeah i did change the C ton c in contains :p
[07:39:31] <greytrilby> are you getting any errors in firebug? what browser are you using
[07:39:34] <Woet> juria_roberts: change your code into divs and make everybody happy.
[07:39:42] <Woet> juria_roberts: and next time, never use tables for markup :)
[07:40:19] <rethus> ah, have a ide... i could use if(area!="right") return false;
[07:40:34] <dundan> thanks! :)
[07:40:37] <dundan> now works <3
[07:40:42] <greytrilby> yay!
[07:40:50] <juria_roberts> Woet: it will be a lot of work
[07:40:50] <greytrilby> @timbreck - can I borrow you a sec?
[07:41:05] <Woet> juria_roberts: your fault for using tables for markup in the first place, that's been deprecated for like 5 years now
[07:41:14] <Woet> juria_roberts: animations, besides fadeout/fadein, are not supported on tables.
[07:41:17] <timbreck> greytrilby: hmm sure
[07:41:26] <sadmicrowave> juria_roberts, see this link http://blog.thefrontiergroup.com.au/2008/12/animating-table-rows-with-jquery/
[07:41:30] <greytrilby> having a small ajax issue.
[07:41:31] <juria_roberts> Woet: its not my fault im innocent :(
[07:41:41] <Woet> juria_roberts: or put a div around your td
[07:41:48] <Woet> juria_roberts: very ugly and invalid HTML solution though
[07:41:54] <juria_roberts> Woet: you cant do that
[07:41:59] <a|i> does appendTo first delete the element somehow? i cannot apply appendTo to a flash object, without the flash being re-initialised.
[07:42:04] <greytrilby> basically it's a contact form... on submitting the form (to a processing page) it'll get a result back, but from that processing page I only want it to return the div containing the message
[07:42:08] <Woet> juria_roberts: http://blog.thefrontiergroup.com.au/2008/12/animating-table-rows-with-jquery/
[07:42:09] <kborchers> Woet: i almost yelled at you until you admitted it was invalid html ;)
[07:42:33] <Woet> kborchers: you don't use tables with divs around your tds for your website?!
[07:42:39] <Woet> with animated gifs, obviously.
[07:42:46] <greytrilby> code is here
[07:42:47] <greytrilby> http://jsfiddle.net/CVynT/
[07:42:57] <greytrilby> in other pages I use 'load' to successfully bring in just one div
[07:43:11] <Woet> kborchers: and background mp3s!
[07:43:31] <greytrilby> but for some reason when using it with returned data, it gives a 403 on using load, and using (html(data)) it just returns the full page
[07:44:00] <kborchers> lol, no i pretty much just stick to the marquee tag
[07:44:17] <Woet> kborchers: <blink> is better.

[07:45:34] <Woet> sadmicrowave: that's what I said, put a div around the td
[07:45:37] <Woet> [16:41:48] <Woet> juria_roberts: very ugly and invalid HTML solution though

[07:56:01] <fabiobik> hi guys
[07:56:05] <sadmicrowave> hi
[07:56:25] <qwerty57> omg just had a chrome bug that made me think i'm going crazy
[07:56:37] <fabiobik> how to write an generic cod to process all forms with jquery?
[07:56:43] <fabiobik> *code
[07:57:04] <fabiobik> i mean with 2 or more forms at same page
[07:57:11] <sadmicrowave> $('form').each(function(){ $(this).seralize(); });
[07:57:22] <qwerty57> on refresh it didn't see .js file has changed and was using one from cache
[07:57:28] <sadmicrowave> fabiobik, or something like that
[07:57:41] <qwerty57> i'm editing .js and I see nothing actually changed
[07:57:43] <fabiobik> nice one
[07:57:49] <qwerty57> i try alerts, nothing
[07:58:01] <qwerty57> in 15minutes i was doint ctrl+a, ctrl+x, ctrl+s
[07:58:12] <qwerty57> empty .js file. i go chrome and it still works o_O
[07:58:43] <sadmicrowave> fabiobik, actually $(this).submit(); if you don't need to do anything to the form elements
[07:59:18] <sadmicrowave> fabiobik, and if thats the case, then $('form').submit() will submit all forms on the page
[07:59:32] <sadmicrowave> fabiobik, without the .each() function needed
[07:59:42] <juria_roberts> sadmicrowave: its not workin in ie
[07:59:58] <sadmicrowave> thats because IE blows balls
[08:00:14] <here4thegear> may not be the right room but, autocomplete(url or data,[options] ). can the first are actually be function(e){ajax call with JSON result}?
[08:00:35] <here4thegear> are = arg
[08:01:10] <dundan> thanks for the fishes :)

[08:02:25] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, not without seeing some code
[08:02:31] <greytrilby> heh - fair enough!
[08:02:31] <kborchers> a|i: $("element_to_move").insertAfter("element_to_place_after");

[08:04:42] <greytrilby> @sadmicrowave You don't have permission to access /gtnew2/&lt;!DOCTYPE
[08:05:36] <greytrilby> @sad - I'm trying to submit a form via ajax, which works, but when it returns a success message I only want it to display the 'content' div. The processing page is a fully written html page so that it still works without javascript
[08:05:37] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, not sure what you are trying to do with the second .html() line
[08:05:40] <bjhaid> please is there any jquery ui widget that I can use such that when an event is triggered it displays above all open windows
[08:06:19] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, what is the value of 'data'?
[08:06:27] <kborchers> a|i: i'm confused. what is wrong with it making a copy? it makes the copy, inserts in new place, removes the old one. what's the problem with that? how else do you expect to "move" an element?
[08:06:32] <greytrilby> @sadmicrowave - it appears on the page "about.php" - it then posts the form to "contact.php".
[08:07:00] <greytrilby> @sadmicrowave - "contact.php" sends an email and returns "email sent"
[08:07:26] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, so then you want $('#content').html( data )?
[08:07:46] <a|i> kborchers: I'm trying to move a flash object. the problem with copying is that it creates a new flash object, which re-initialises the flash content, losing the flash content state. is it possible to move with keeping a reference to the moving object?
[08:07:48] <greytrilby> sadmicro - sort of, yes
[08:08:27] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, I fail to see the problem...why not put that line then instead of $('#formholder').html(data)?
[08:08:31] <greytrilby> i want to replace the contents of a div in "about.php" with the returned contents of the div 'content' in contact.php
[08:08:56] <greytrilby> @sadmicrowave -#formholder is the div I want to replace the content of
[08:09:09] <kborchers> a|i: i don't think that's possible without somehow saving and reinstating the state yourself on the new object.
[08:09:09] <greytrilby> #content (in a different file) is the content I want to put in it
[08:09:41] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, so...your other file is returning the contents of '#content' in 'data'?
[08:10:12] <a|i> kborchers: the flash object is the webcam. there is no way to save the state. when it loses the state, it asks for camera permission again.
[08:10:20] <greytrilby> sadmicro - yep, except not just #content - it's returning the full page - I just want the pbit of the page that is #content
[08:10:42] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, that sounds like it has to do with your contact.php page and what it is returning
[08:10:53] <Anticom> i don't get, why this works on jsfiddle but when i copy-paste the code in my js-file, the alert is empty =( http://jsfiddle.net/wyAA8/
[08:10:58] <greytrilby> if I do something like ("#formholder").load("contact.php", "#content") it would do what I wanted
[08:11:03] <Anticom> any ideas?
[08:11:09] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, so just do that
[08:11:42] <bjhaid> any idea on how I can embed an html page within another?
[08:11:49] <greytrilby> That's what I'm trying to do - but when I do (replacing ".html(data)" with "load(data)" I get an error
[08:11:50] <a|i> kborchers: javascript keeps a reference of objects when using =, why is that moving an element has to create a copy of that object?
[08:12:14] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, don't do ajax, just do the .load
[08:12:53] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, is contact.php on the same domain?
[08:12:55] <greytrilby> but then how do I submit the form?
[08:13:00] <greytrilby> @sadmicrowave - yes
[08:13:18] <kborchers> a|i: you're not just dealing with javascript though, you're dealing with the DOM. you can't insert a javascript object into the dom, dom elements have to be created from that object and inserted.
[08:13:27] <greytrilby> I think part of the problem is that 'load()' doesn't parse html properly (hence the 403)
[08:13:40] <sunmao> Hi! I have got a problem! I have table what I am creating when I'am loading the page(without JS) later I load data to this table(via AJAX). In one td tag sometimes I render lots of dynamic datas. When I click to the td tag I need these childrens id. How can I find it out? Here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/we4Kz/3/
[08:14:29] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, ok, you need to submit 'str' and get the returned contents from contact.php but contact.php is returning the entire html of that page and not just the html of div #contents...
[08:14:33] <sadmicrowave> thats the problem right?
[08:15:02] <greytrilby> sadmicrowave - yep. That's by design pretty much, so if the user doesn't have javascript it just operates like a normal page
[08:15:20] <kborchers> a|i: what exactly are you trying to do with your move, just place somewhere else on page?
[08:16:01] <a|i> kborchers: yes. it's simply a flash webcam object. I'm trying to move it somewhere else when the user wants to change the layout.
[08:16:06] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, you have two options, make you contact.php return what you ACTUALLY want. or convert 'data' to a DOM object and find '#content' within that
[08:16:32] <a|i> kborchers: but it's very annoying to lose the camera permission state every time the flash object is moved.
[08:16:37] <greytrilby> that makes sense - how do I convert to a DOM object? *noob face on*
[08:16:56] <sunmao> get()
[08:16:59] <sunmao> get(0)
[08:17:20] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/CVynT/2/
[08:17:33] <kborchers> a|i: hmmm, i wonder, depending on your layout if you could just use animate() to move it to another location and move the other elements in the layout at the same time. that would all very much depend on the positioning and layout of your interface though
[08:17:43] <a|i> kborchers: one way is, instead of moving, just change the position (with position = absolute), but it doesn't sound very stable.
[08:17:46] <burkeb03> quick masonry question if anyone has a sec http://regan.rubytape.com/updates/  Click on an item in the last row.   Since masonry elements are absolutely positioned, they fall off the page which is undesirable.  What is the best way to keep that content visible?  Thoughts? Thanks!
[08:18:05] <kborchers> a|i: hah, same idea at the same time
[08:18:07] <greytrilby> ahhh sooo - you are truly a jedi! I'll give that a whirl - thank you!
[08:18:17] <sadmicrowave> yea, see if it works
[08:18:53] <a|i> kborchers: yep :) but after animate worked, what is the parent element moves? would the moved object follow the parent, or do I have to bind an event to it?
[08:19:12] <a|i> kborchers: what if*
[08:19:15] <kborchers> a|i: yeah, you could just change the css position without animate as well and have quick jumps, and yes stability would be an issue
[08:19:31] <kborchers> a|i: parent element?
[08:20:01] <a|i> kborchers: yes, we are trying to 'simulate' the move from one parent element to another.
[08:20:03] <sunmao> I have table what I am creating when I'am loading the page(without JS) later I load data to this table(via AJAX). In one td tag sometimes I render lots of dynamic datas. When I click to the td tag I need these childrens id. How can I find it out? Here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/we4Kz/3/

[08:21:04] <sunmao> kggle: did you try it? it always gives back dynamic_stuff2
[08:21:06] <sunmao> dynamic_stuff1
[08:21:08] <sunmao> sorry
[08:21:16] <sunmao> so it always give back dynamic_stuff1
[08:21:20] <a|i> kborchers: eg, if you scroll down, wouldn't the  moved flash object stay static on the page (because of position = absolute)?
[08:21:22] <sunmao> even if you click dynamic_stuff2
[08:22:11] <kborchers> a|i: no, position fixed does that. if you scroll the object would scroll with absolute
[08:22:31] <a|i> kborchers: good, I'll try this now.
[08:22:53] <cbobo> how can I change a Select box to be marked as selected ?
[08:23:15] <greytrilby> @sadmicrowave - hmmm - it's not finding anything - not getting error now, but nothing is being loaded into #formholder
[08:24:37] <cbobo> If I have a <option><select>a</select><select>b</select></option>  how can I use jQuery in order to mark b selected?
[08:24:59] <kborchers> cbobo: your html is backwards
[08:25:28] <kborchers> cbobo: you should have options wrapped in a select
[08:25:30] <greytrilby> @sadmicrowave - just did alert(content) -  returned null
[08:25:44] <cbobo> yes sorry, kborchers
[08:25:58] <cbobo> I have it reversed I just typed it up in ircII wrong
[08:26:14] <logik-bomb> guys, how can I check if my object does not belong go parents('selector') ?
[08:26:20] <sunmao> nobody has an idea?
[08:26:21] <logik-bomb> *to
[08:27:08] <ngharo> cbobo: give your options values and then call $('select#id').val('foo') where foo is the option value
[08:27:25] <logik-bomb> never mind

[08:31:33] <nickelnick> my site worked perfectly ()almost) before i introduced the new library
[08:31:50] <nickelnick> went from sliding to the new page, to stuck at "loading"
[08:32:04] <kborchers> nickelnick: you may want to try #jquerymobile if no help here

[08:58:35] <eddiemonge> i have parts/joins turned off
[09:03:18] <_mpa> hi, can someone assist me with the following question? (actually it's a statement that i want to rebuke) ... "  jQuery overrides Array and Object.  This is dangerous, especially when a page uses scripts
[09:03:18] <_mpa> from multiple sources".
[09:03:57] <sadmicrowave> _mpa, in what way does jQuery do this?
[09:04:47] <_mpa> sadmicrowave: i'm not sure, i've been told this...
[09:04:58] <_mpa> i assume it does, within it's own scope?
[09:05:05] <sadmicrowave> _mpa, oh, I thought whoever told you this would have also told you how/why they believe that
[09:05:19] <qwerty57> I have a sliding div at the bottom of the page, and when i jquery.slideDown it 400px below and I have to scroll down manually to see it. Is there a way to make screen scroll down itself?
[09:05:20] <_mpa> no, unfortunately.
[09:06:01] <sadmicrowave> _mpa, well, you can tell jquery to override arrays and objects with your own if you want, but I'm not sure if thats what your asking
[09:07:14] <_mpa> sadmicrowave: it's the core implementation, the statement is implying that by including jquery on a page, it will explicitly override the base browser Object and Array types (Which will potentially cause
[09:07:14] <_mpa> problems with other scripts...)
[09:07:32] <_mpa> sadmicrowave: i can't say i've ever had a problem with JQ and anything else i've ever implemented from a 3rd party...
[09:08:15] <_mpa> sadmicrowave: but i'm more an implementor, not an JS ninja :) but i need to rebuke this statement, so am finding out as much as possible from the 'source' to make an informed response.
[09:08:19] <sadmicrowave> oh, well...I would think that jQuery does a good job about creating unique objects and arrays so as not to override pre-existing objects and arrays from the browser
[09:08:45] <Brammm> Hi guys, quick question: I want to know the calculated width of a floated li element. If I do $('ul li').each(function() { $(this).width(); }); I get a zero width :(
[09:09:04] <sadmicrowave> personally I've never had an issue with jquery overriding anything browser specific
[09:09:09] <kborchers[A]> ?scrollTo @ qwerty57
[09:09:11] <bot-t> qwerty57, ScrollTo | jQuery Plugins - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[09:09:54] <ziro`> anyone know of anything that'd cause setReturnValue to fail in jquery?
[09:09:58] <sadmicrowave> Brammm, you want to know the width of ALL li elements?
[09:10:28] <Brammm> sadmicrowave: I need the total width of all the elements together, so I can set the width of the UL accordingly (need to create a really basic carousel)
[09:10:29] <qwerty57> cool t hanks
[09:12:25] <sadmicrowave> Brammm, it seems like your .each() isn't even looping. perhaps because it didn't find the element type.  maybe try alert( $(this).text() ) inside your .each() to make sure it is finding the right <li>'s
[09:12:51] <Brammm> I'm logging it with console.log, I have 7 list elements, I get 7 times "0"
[09:14:05] <nickelnick> whats the deal with the new mobile library? any time I want to use an input of either "text" or "password" the friggin thing just get stuck at "loading"
[09:14:12] <sadmicrowave> Brammm, can you make a jsfiddle of your code?
[09:14:15] <nickelnick> yet an input of "button" works fie
[09:14:16] <nickelnick> ine

[09:15:46] <Brammm> sadmicrowave: http://jsfiddle.net/EGGZL/
[09:19:01] <Snugug> I have a bunch of nested divs and I know the ID of the parent; how do I select and change the width of all of the children? I've tried $('#parent').children().each(function(){$(this).width()}); but it's only selecting the first child
[09:19:46] <Brammm> Snugug: do you want the children to have the width of the parent?
[09:20:05] <Snugug> Brammm: Yes I do
[09:20:31] <Brammm> Then you need the fetch the width of the parent first (or simply use $('#parent').width() again
[09:20:42] <kborchers> Brammm: you need to do it on window.onload since without the images, the li's width is 0 and the images load after the dom is ready
[09:20:59] <Brammm> kborchers: oh damn, it's just that?
[09:21:08] <kborchers> i think so
[09:21:09] <Snugug> Brammm: I should have specified. I've got width(new_width);
[09:21:13] <Brammm> kborchers: can I force that in jquery? It makes sense
[09:21:21] <Snugug> so I've got a variable inside of width to what I want to change width to
[09:21:47] <Snugug> The issue isn't so much changing the width, it's that it's only selecting the first child
[09:21:58] <Brammm> try debugging by alerting the text/class/id whatever of the children. is the alert called only once?
[09:22:06] <Snugug> Brammm: Yes
[09:22:17] <Brammm> hmm, can you post your html?
[09:22:21] <kborchers> Brammm: i think you can do $(window).load(function() {...}); instead of $(document).ready(function() { ... });
[09:22:32] <Brammm> I'll give it a go, thanks kbo
[09:22:35] <Brammm> kborchers: :p
[09:22:48] <Snugug> Brammm: Yah, gimme a second
[09:23:18] <Brammm> kborchers: that fixed it thanks!
[09:24:14] <kborchers> Brammm: be carefule though, it may not work cross-browser unfortunately. waiting on images is a headache http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[09:24:40] <Brammm> damn, maybe I'm best off setting the widths of the elements beforehand then
[09:24:50] <Brammm> I'm gonna be forced to use 200px images anyhow
[09:24:52] <kborchers> Brammm: would be the safest route :(
[09:25:00] <Brammm> k, thanks
[09:28:13] <Snugug> Brammm: http://pastebin.com/fGb4UqLM
[09:28:37] <Snugug> The HTML is generated by my CMS, no way to change the structure
[09:28:49] <Brammm> What's the parent, what's the child?
[09:29:18] <Snugug> The parent is #cboxLoadedContent and the child is everything below it, but I specifically want to target all of the children up until and including the image
[09:29:27] <Brammm> kborchers: is there a width() function that will take margins into account?
[09:29:48] <kborchers> ?outerWidth @ Brammm
[09:29:48] <bot-t> Brammm, .outerWidth([includeMargin]): Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding and border. http://api.jquery.com/outerWidth/
[09:29:54] <macabre> not sure why this code isn't firing.. its a select all function, which is not selecting anything - http://pastie.org/2254855
[09:30:09] <Brammm> Snugug: .children() only selects direct children of an element, cboxloaded blabla only has one child (lightbox-stack)
[09:30:17] <Brammm> use find() to select ALL children
[09:30:25] <Snugug> Brammm: Example?
[09:30:44] <Brammm> $('#parent').find().each(...)
[09:30:56] <Brammm> ?find @ Snugug
[09:30:57] <bot-t> Snugug, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[09:31:18] <Brammm> kborchers: thanks, forgot the includeMargin param
[09:31:33] <kborchers> Snugug: you need to use .attr("checked", "checked");
[09:31:38] <Snugug> Brammm: what if I want all of them and don't know the selectors though?
[09:31:48] <Brammm> Snugug: use the * selector?
[09:32:17] <sadmicrowave> Snugug, are they div's?
[09:32:25] <Snugug> Brammm: Duh. And no, not all of them are divs
[09:32:34] <kborchers> Snugug: try .attr('checked', $('#checkall').attr('checked'));
[09:32:41] <Snugug> kborchers: Thanks
[09:33:38] <kborchers> Snugug: actually better way in your case .attr('checked', $(this).attr(':checked'));
[09:34:38] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, are you wanting to return a true or false in the checked value?
[09:34:45] <ryanprior> How can I find out what number child an element is inside its parent?
[09:35:07] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: no, i want 'checked' or ''
[09:35:38] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, oh yea I see now
[09:36:04] <ryanprior> I tried $.inArray($(object), $(object.parent().children())) but that always returns -1, so I don't think that's the appropriate method to use.
[09:36:18] <ryanprior> Surely there's something simple to find out whether the object is the first child or the third or whatever?
[09:36:55] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: and actually my last post was wrong. should be  .attr('checked', $(this).attr('checked')); not :checked but looks like Snugug left. oh well
[09:37:28] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, well thats why I was asking, because with the ':' it looked like you were going for $(this).is(':checked')
[09:37:34] <macabre> hm, im having the same issue with checked, or checkall
[09:37:49] <macabre>  http://pastie.org/2254855
[09:37:57] <kborchers> sadmicrowave: that's what his code started as and i forgot to pull the : out
[09:38:04] <sadmicrowave> gotcha
[09:38:10] <sadmicrowave> i didn't see his original post
[09:38:32] <erichynds> you can also just check the boolean property "this.checked"
[09:38:33] * sadmicrowave has a lazy finger and can't scroll up
[09:40:18] <supsup> hey if you don't wait for the dom to load why is it considered harmful to execute js?  is it harmful even if the selectors you are manipulating have already been added to the dom?
[09:40:57] <erichynds> its not harmful, just your selectors won't work
[09:41:21] <supsup> do you mean the selectors that have not been added to dom yet won't work?
[09:41:27] <erichynds> correct
[09:41:32] <supsup> ok cool
[09:42:16] <supsup> thats what i thought i just read about it being harmful -- and was like wtf?
[09:42:33] <erichynds> that's crazy talk
[09:43:43] <supsup> i used wrong works...resource says:  "cannot safely manipulate" .. not harmful.
[09:44:38] <ryanprior> supsup: it's harmful from the perspective that your code may work one day, then start working differently later, based on how the browser loads the DOM while your javascript is running. if you wait 'til the DOM is loaded, you get consistent behaviour, which makes life easier for browser developers and anybody relying on your code.
[09:45:00] <supsup> word
[09:45:04] <ryanprior> supsup: so it's not harmful to the computer the javascript is running on... but it's harmful to the code ecosystem you're participating in. ^^
[09:46:06] <ryanprior> what's a simple way to find out what number child a given node is within its parent?
[09:46:50] <supsup> how do you identify the child?
[09:47:12] <supsup> does it have a unique id ?
[09:47:14] <greytrilby> Hi chaps... when calling a page, why would text() give me a result, but html() returns null? (even though it's an html page i'm calling!)
[09:47:31] <ryanprior> it does not have a unique id. It was clicked on, or had some sort of event originate from it, so I have a reference to it that way.
[09:47:55] <kborchers> ?index @ ryanprior
[09:47:55] <bot-t> ryanprior, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[09:48:00] <greytrilby> http://jsfiddle.net/qx3dv/
[09:48:19] <ryanprior> kborchers: woot.
[09:48:52] <supsup> $(this).parent().index($(this)); maybe
[09:49:37] <kborchers> supsup: no, just $(this).index() gives the index of the current element in relation to its siblings
[09:49:48] <supsup> ooo
[09:49:52] <supsup> cool
[09:50:20] <roger_padactor> is there a jquery plugin for key/value browser storage but if not resorts back to cookies or something?
[09:50:27] <m0dmd> hey what's up everyone.
[09:51:19] <greytrilby> wotcha
[09:51:22] <supsup> greytrilby : i think the returned results is an array
[09:51:30] <greytrilby> hmmm
[09:51:30] <m0dmd> wotcha gotcha!
[09:51:36] <supsup> also depends on what version of jquery ur using
[09:51:42] <greytrilby> 1.5
[09:52:12] <greytrilby> basically i have two pages - about.php (which has a form) and contact.php (which processes it)
[09:52:21] <supsup> maybe try var $myData = $(data)[0];  then $myData.html()
[09:52:43] <greytrilby> I'm just trying to load a div from a page following ajax sucess!
[09:52:43] <supsup> assuming data is the response
[09:52:47] <greytrilby> not happenening!
[09:53:06] <greytrilby> about.php posts to contact, contact then returns either 'yay' or 'nay'
[09:53:14] <greytrilby> BUT!
[09:53:30] <supsup> use firebug or chromtools to inspect your response
[09:53:34] <greytrilby> contact.php isn't just a processing page - it's a fully designed webpage (in case javascript is disabled)
[09:53:45] <eddiemonge> greytrilby: if you are returning html fragments then you can do $('#formholder').html(data)
[09:54:03] <eddiemonge> and in the post options:   data: html
[09:54:03] <greytrilby> eddie - that's what i'm doing, trouble is I don't want the full data, I just want a fragment of it
[09:54:36] <supsup> i thought 1.5 is when they supped up ajax to make it a pure object u could use find on etc
[09:54:52] <greytrilby> supsup - I'm trying to use find() at the moment
[09:55:00] <greytrilby> i have it working within a page
[09:55:08] <eddiemonge> greytrilby: there is no data: str
[09:55:14] <ch3mical> Morning!
[09:55:39] <greytrilby> eddie - how do you mean?
[09:56:17] <greytrilby> hangon - lemme just repost my code how I thought it should work - what I posted just now is kinda bastardised
[09:56:29] <eddiemonge> greytrilby: was str a variable?
[09:57:18] <supsup> grey - just find out the format of the response object and go from there...thats what i tend to do  if i'm using old version of jquery i have to get it from array and then save it to jquery object then use jquery methods over it
[09:59:51] <greytrilby> sorry about that - revised code here http://jsfiddle.net/zBUNP/
[10:00:34] <_mpa> what's the consensus on the best GUI / debugging tool for JS/JQ? I'm still using Firebug for most of my work coupled with N++ or VS2010
[10:00:44] <greytrilby> str is the serialised form data (which is passed to contact.php) - contact.php then processes it and says "yep, that's done" or "nope, there was a problem"
[10:00:57] <greytrilby> 'data' is what contact.php returns
[10:01:20] <greytrilby> if I do 'alert(data)' i see the full html code that contact.php returns
[10:01:20] <erichynds> _mpa: webkit inspector ftw
[10:03:03] <ptriller> Hi, how do I make a split panel with jquery UI I only found a very old example in the interwebs ...
[10:03:17] <greytrilby> @eddiemonge @supsup - so I'm returning the data fine, but find() just doesn't seem to find the div contained therewithin
[10:04:29] <eddiemonge> greytrilby: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/zBUNP/2/  look at whats returned in the console
[10:04:30] <Paganini> When using posting a form using .submit() and preventDefault() is there a way to post the submit value with the serialized form? hopefully that makes sense :P
[10:05:34] <erichynds> Paganini: $.post()
[10:06:13] <greytrilby> @eddiemonge console returns full html :) - it was doing that if I expanded the 'contact.php' element in the console
[10:06:23] <greytrilby> @eddiemonge - it's just like find() isn't working :(
[10:06:39] <eddiemonge> do you have a live link?
[10:06:59] <supsup> greytrilby: http://jsfiddle.net/zBUNP/1/ did u ever try this?
[10:07:05] <greytrilby> http://greytrilby.no-ip.info/gtnew2/about.php
[10:07:31] <greytrilby> supsup - oops, no, sorry, didn't see tht
[10:07:34] <Paganini> sorry erichynds I'm using $.post like this: http://pastie.org/2255037
[10:08:29] <ch3mical> greytrilby: your photo starts out exceptionally large, then suddenly resizes...
[10:08:45] <greytrilby> ch3mical - it's a very slow server
[10:08:50] <greytrilby> but it's meant to resize down...
[10:09:09] <greytrilby> ch3mical - trying to make resizable slideshow (that's a different page though)
[10:09:18] <supsup> ah i looked at your page. nm your returning html
[10:09:38] <greytrilby> supsup - no worries. It took a while to return the html, but now for the life of me can't get find working!
[10:09:39] <eddiemonge> greytrilby: its also returning an error and a full page instead of just a fragment
[10:09:53] <greytrilby> eddie - that's the problem i'm trying to rectify :)
[10:10:00] <greytrilby> the smtp error is fine - i'm expecting that
[10:10:11] <greytrilby> but what I SHOULD be seeing is "sorry, something's gone wrong"
[10:10:34] <greytrilby> 'cos THAT's the bit that the user's meant to see, and ONLY that bit!
[10:11:18] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, I still haven't figured out why you get contact.php to dump your entire html when the user just needs to see 'sorry, something's gone wrong'
[10:11:35] <sadmicrowave> just have php return "sorry, something's gone wrong" or "success"
[10:11:38] <greytrilby> @sadmicrowave - thanks!
[10:12:12] <eddiemonge> greytrilby: yeah return json with the status and the message
[10:12:14] <greytrilby> @sadmicrowave - it's looking like i might have to do that - I just want to avoid it in case the user doesn't have js enabled
[10:12:34] <greytrilby> @eddie *blank look* - sorry - not familiar with jason
[10:12:37] <greytrilby> json
[10:12:43] * greytrilby slaps forehead
[10:12:57] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, you are SOL anyways is the user doesn't have js enabled because your $.ajax() isn't going to work to submit 'str'
[10:12:59] <greytrilby> if you look at the 'div finder' link on the same page, the find() function works fine
[10:13:50] <greytrilby> @sadmicrowave - actually no - because the form is written such that it WILL work without js - the jquery uses preventdefault. without that, it just goes to contact.php and displays a normal webpage
[10:15:12] <supsup> greytrillby you could use reg-ex match i guess:  data.match(/id="content"/g)  -- then just hardcode response to a dive on page or soemthing.
[10:15:17] <eddiemonge> greytrilby: send a query in the string that says its ajax. on the php side, if its ajax then send json (hint: json_encode) if not, send the page normally
[10:15:36] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, so add another POST value for 'jsenabled=true' or 'false' to the form action and the ajax url and on the contact.php side have it either load the entire html or just the string you want depending on $_POST['jsenabled'] value
[10:15:47] <sadmicrowave> eddiemonge, ^^
[10:15:49] <supsup> i don't tend to return whole html documents.  if i return html it tends to be just the html i need not a whole document
[10:16:02] <supsup> often ijust return a json object
[10:16:19] <supsup> makes it easy
[10:16:32] * greytrilby needs to learn about json
[10:16:32] <supsup> why don't u edit your error page to just be the error div part?
[10:16:36] <supsup> then find would prob work.
[10:16:50] <greytrilby> supsup - cos then my non-js functionality doesn't work
[10:16:53] <sadmicrowave> supsup++
[10:17:00] <supsup> o
[10:17:11] <supsup> well -- have a <no script> on the same page
[10:17:16] <supsup> nm
[10:17:19] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, it still would - you would just be directed to a page that says 'error' or 'success'
[10:17:20] <supsup> anyway use .match then
[10:17:22] <sadmicrowave> and nothing else
[10:17:26] <eddiemonge> greytrilby: like i said and so did sadmicrowave just use a flag
[10:17:45] <sadmicrowave> greytrilby, that is the best thing to do in this case
[10:17:50] <sadmicrowave> ^^
[10:17:50] <supsup> use .match and if length of result > 0 then u know it matched
[10:18:41] <greytrilby> I think I'm going to have to do that - it's just the principle of the thing, ya know? it SHOULD work!
[10:18:51] <solepixel> I wrote this simple toggler to toggle fieldsets and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how to "remember" which ones are toggled-closed without requiring an ID for every one of them?
[10:19:04] <supsup> actually just make a regex to get that whole div
[10:19:16] <supsup> since it seems there is dynamic stuff in there
[10:21:30] <eddiemonge> greytrilby: try this
[10:21:31] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/zBUNP/4/
[10:23:54] <supsup> it wn't work because he is returning a full html document
[10:25:55] <greytrilby> @eddie, @supsup
[10:26:32] <supsup> var madangcontent = data.match( /<div id="content">(.*?)<\/div>/)[0]
[10:26:34] <supsup> there u go
[10:26:42] <greytrilby> @eddie, @supsup - the problem seems to be occurring when putting $(data) into the $data variable - $(data) returns fine, $data returns null;
[10:27:45] <greytrilby> @eddie - already tried that - "data.find()" is not a function" :(
[10:28:31] <supsup> grey: http://jsfiddle.net/zBUNP/5/
[10:29:50] <greytrilby> supsup - works nicely!!
[10:30:02] * greytrilby buys the man a beer
[10:30:06] <supsup> you could of also added a flag to contact.php like:  contact.php?ajax=true and have the php just return the html fragment
[10:30:19] <supsup> and on the form u would not have that param so it would return the whole html page
[10:30:34] <greytrilby> @supsup - true that
[10:30:43] <greytrilby> just a mystery as to why find isn't working
[10:30:50] <greytrilby> but thank you very, very much for your help!
[10:30:54] <greytrilby> (all of your!)
[10:30:57] <greytrilby> (you)
[10:31:02] <supsup> its because your returning a whole html doc
[10:31:48] <greytrilby> @supsup - how does that cause the problem?
[10:32:25] <supsup> not sure but i think that is what casues it.   -- perhaps i'm wrong easy to test tho just temporarily remove everything for the non-js people and try it out
[10:33:00] <greytrilby> @supsup - think I'll leave that for another day
[10:33:07] <greytrilby> there's beer to be drunk :)
[10:33:18] <greytrilby> it is friday, afterall
[10:33:26] <greytrilby> cheers for the help guys!
[10:34:44] <eddiemonge> in case anyone else is wondering, it causes it because $(data) breaks up the page into an array and not encapsulates the whole thing into a jquery object
[10:35:22] <supsup> eddie i tried to do $(data)[0]
[10:35:26] <supsup> did not appear to work either
[10:35:37] <kenthree> any easy way to prevent user-select from double clicks but allow from click+drag?
[10:35:40] <supsup> the response seemed to be a pure string
[10:35:50] <supsup> not an array
[10:36:36] <supsup> or an object
[10:40:48] <solepixel> anyone noticed any weirdness when inserting an absolutely positioned element inside a legend?
[10:41:02] <eddiemonge> why would you do that?
[10:41:18] <solepixel> one sec i'll show you
[10:41:21] <eddiemonge> supsup: thats because $(data) was a text object
[10:41:46] <solepixel> http://screencast.com/t/GGFObXGSCJuQ
[10:42:04] <ericbarnes> is it not possible to delete a javascript object after use?
[10:42:36] <solepixel> i'm inserting a toggler and if I write the html directly on the page, it looks fine, but when I do an append to the legend element, it puts it at the top of the page
[10:42:40] <solepixel> only in Firefox
[10:44:24] <Paganini> I have a <button> within a <form> but when I serialize the form it doesn't seem to get the buttons value to process the page via $.post, can somebody help me please? http://pastie.org/2255037
[10:44:31] <eddiemonge> ericbarnes: set it to null but theres not an unset
[10:44:49] <solepixel> Paganini: make sure your button has a name attribute
[10:45:01] <eddiemonge> solepixel: again, why are you absolutely positioning it?
[10:45:11] <Paganini> it does, it's called submitregistration
[10:45:24] <solepixel> eddiemonge I suppose I could float it right
[10:45:26] <Paganini> in my serialized alert, it doesn't show the value there
[10:45:38] <solepixel> just didn't want to F up if it ran into the text in the legend
[10:45:53] <eddiemonge> solepixel: you dont know what a legend is for right?
[10:46:05] <solepixel> Paganini: are you using <button> or <input type="button" />
[10:46:11] <Paganini> <button>
[10:46:13] <solepixel> i know what a legend is for
[10:46:34] <solepixel> Paganini: not sure of those are valid form elements
[10:46:48] <Paganini> well <button type="submit"> to be clearer
[10:47:05] <Paganini> might just be easier to change it to a input type submit I guess?
[10:47:06] <solepixel> yeah I know those submit forms, but not sure they can hold a value
[10:47:16] <solepixel> lookup the attributes for button and see if name and value are in there
[10:47:29] <tucan> for some reason when you click Gift Certificate on the right hand side, the box doesnt slide in IE9, can someone take a look?  http://jleesoft.com/cardones/
[10:47:34] <Paganini> I have and yeah name and value are attributes
[10:47:43] <eddiemonge> "The LEGEND element allows authors to assign a caption to a FIELDSET"
[10:48:01] <eddiemonge> its not meant to be a container
[10:48:05] <solepixel> eddiemonge: so are you saying use the fieldset to hold my toggle element, rather than the legend?
[10:49:00] <Aristata> Hey guys, I have an unordered list, each list item has an up arrow and a down arrow to reorder them. How do I swap list element rows?
[10:49:00] <Aristata> I thought there would be like a swap method or something
[10:49:00] <Aristata> It's lloking like I might have to just write something on my own
[10:49:04] <eddiemonge> solepixel: no im saying to not use legend of fieldset but rather some a div or something thats an actual block level element
[10:49:28] <eddiemonge> ?before @ Aristata
[10:49:29] <bot-t> Aristata, .before(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, before each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/before/
[10:49:33] <solepixel> but the legend still serves the purpose of being a legend
[10:49:34] <eddiemonge> ?after @ Aristata
[10:49:35] <bot-t> Aristata, .after(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[10:49:46] <solepixel> it's ok, i can move it outside the legend
[10:49:55] <Aristata> Awww great, I will need both of those! Thanks guys
[10:49:57] <eddiemonge> solepixel: the legend is to say what the form is for. not to hold controls for the form
[10:50:18] <solepixel> ok, no problem, i'll just put it outside the legend
[10:50:52] <eddiemonge> http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#form-structure
[10:51:43] <ericbarnes> eddiemonge Thanks
[10:51:45] <Paganini> solepixel even changing the button to input type submit, it doesn't display the value in my alert :/ is preventdefault stopping this?
[10:53:53] <eddiemonge> Paganini: whats your issue?
[10:55:49] <Paganini> serializing my form does not include the submit buttons value, although stackflow may have the answer, when seralizing a form from the form DOM it doesn't include the button as it doesn't believe it's been pressed?
[10:56:07] <Paganini> so I need to assign the click function to the button itself and then gather the form contents? is this correct?
[10:56:32] <eddiemonge> why not just have the value in a hidden form? the button's value is only passed when its clicked
[10:56:56] <Paganini> yeah I was actually considering that, I'm new to jquery so I wanted to find out why the value isn't being sent
[10:57:09] <eddiemonge> thats not jquery, thats html
[10:57:24] <Paganini> the forms button not being serialized was my jquery... query :)
[10:57:45] <eddiemonge> its like if you hit enter in a form, the buttons value isnt always passed
[10:58:13] <Paganini> yeah I understand now, thankyou for your help :)
[11:00:50] <glaksmono> when you do $(window) within an iframe, does it grab the iframe window or the user's window?
[11:01:03] <glaksmono> the JS is the content within the iframe
[11:01:17] <eddiemonge> you mean $(document)>
[11:01:26] <glaksmono> no.. $(window)
[11:06:29] <nohorse> anybody have a quick script to change themes on the fly?  I have an ap that needs day/night modes
[11:07:24] <benji__> Hi, is that normal that in : <a href="javascript:smthg(this)" , this is actually pointing to the Window ?
[11:08:40] <tucan> Hi, for some reason when you click Gift Certificate on the right hand side, the box doesnt slide in IE9, can someone take a look?  http://jleesoft.com/cardones/
[11:09:42] <tucan> only in IE9
[11:09:55] <eddiemonge> nohorse: use classes. then you can do add or remove on the class
[11:10:29] <wathek> Hi all
[11:10:37] <wathek> I'm using ajax and I'm getting a json answer but I'd like to know how can I access the elements here's the answer I'm getting : {"Prod":{"HT":null,"TTC":"0.00"},"Panier":{"HT":12.3,"TTC":"14.71"}}   How can I access Panier=>TTC  for example  ?
[11:11:14] <taar779> Is there a function that work similar to .closest() but instead looks at the children rather than the parents?
[11:11:35] <eddiemonge> response.Panier.TTC
[11:11:47] <eddiemonge> taar779: find, child, children
[11:11:48] <wathek> I see
[11:11:56] <wathek> thanks a lot
[11:12:54] <nohorse> eddiemonge: I used the data-theme classes.  so just run a selector on those and change them?  I'll give it a shot.  any examples would be handy
[11:14:16] <jayd3e> I have a ajax post request getting sent to the server containing stringified JSON.  On the server I get something like this http://pastebin.com/ATNzfUVj.  How would I decode it into a dictionary?
[11:14:37] <jayd3e> or better yet, how do I get it decoded into JSON, so I can stick it right into mongodb
[11:15:21] <eddiemonge> nohorse: no, in your css, have .night .whatev { }   and .day .whatev { } and then add class="day" to your body tag and then to switch to night, $('body').addClass('night').removeClass('day')
[11:15:53] <eddiemonge> or you can have day be the normal css and then have special styles for night and then can add night as the class and not even have to remove a day class
[11:16:03] <taar779> eddiemonge, Huh, I thought .find looked up the DOM tree as well, thanks for the help
[11:16:40] <Italian_Plumber> hello
[11:17:29] <Italian_Plumber> I have a question about .serialize().  I want to access one of the elements of the serialize function, not the entire thing.
[11:21:09] <Italian_Plumber> When I put this in the code:
[11:21:24] <Italian_Plumber> alert($("#duplicateFormData").serialize());	
[11:21:26] <Italian_Plumber> I get this:
[11:22:04] <Italian_Plumber> fax=+&email=+&vehicle=+&ad=&approved=yes&requestNumber=76343
[11:22:10] <Italian_Plumber> I want to get just "requestNumber".
[11:23:28] <nohorse> eddiemonge: Hey that's a great idea.  i'll give that a shot.
[11:24:07] <jedimind_> is there any way i can target an :after element that's been created in css ?
[11:24:49] <ch3mical> Is there a dead-simple way of positioning an "X" icon inside the right side of an input box?
[11:25:18] <ch3mical> You know, like you often see for clearing the content of the input
[11:25:38] <jedimind_> yeah, just use some css
[11:25:42] <jedimind_> this isnt the channel for that
[11:26:13] <ch3mical> I'm trying to, but I'm not getting it quite right... If I resize the window the formula makes it a bit off
[11:26:40] <ch3mical> Just trying to sanity-check myself to see if there's a much easier way to do it that I didn't think of
[11:26:47] <jayd3e> or better yet, how do I get it decoded into JSON, so I can stick it right into mongodb
[11:26:49] <jayd3e> I have a ajax post request getting sent to the server containing stringified JSON.  On the server I get something like this http://pastebin.com/ATNzfUVj.  How would I decode it into a dictionary?
[11:27:05] <jayd3e> reverse order^^
[11:28:36] <jedimind_> ch3mical, using 3 lines of css would do it no problem... if you did it right
[11:28:39] <jedimind_> ie not with absolute position
[11:29:05] <ch3mical> Well, could you give me an example? I'm terrible at CSS positioning :D
[11:32:32] <ch3mical> I tried using relative positioning, but then it renders everything else around where the HTML tag originally was... you know
[11:39:15] <phlp> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/roXon/PJZmv/7
[11:42:14] <ch3mical> phlp: this is the issue I'm having with that approach: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/PJZmv/16/
[11:42:46] <ch3mical> phlp: also, it is all wrapped in a box which would also get displaced/bumped around by that method
[11:43:12] <ch3mical> phlp: it's good though, I like this approach, I just need to figure out how to make it not push other things around
[11:43:29] <ch3mical> phlp: That's what I was trying to solve by using absolute positioning
[11:46:38] <phlp> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/PJZmv/17
[11:46:51] <ryanprior> whenever I try to access localStorage, I'm getting Security error" code: "1000
[11:46:57] <ryanprior> what does that mean?
[11:47:07] <ryanprior> googling it shows lots of non-localStorage-related links.
[11:47:38] <ryanprior> I'm using Firefox 5.0 btdubs
[11:48:21] <ch3mical> phlp: checking it out, 1 sec
[11:52:49] <ch3mical> phlp: that seems to have the results I was looking for, thank you very much. Could you also explain what part of that you changed to get the desired effect, so I can understand what's going on there?
[11:53:43] <ch3mical> brb
[11:54:19] <ryanprior> Here's code to reproduce my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/CXSM2/
[11:54:36] <ryanprior> 'lol' is logged, then I get Security error" code: "1000, then 'wut' is not logged.
[11:54:48] <phlp> ch3mical, margin:0 7px 0 -18px; instead of left:-18px;
[11:55:20] <ch3mical> Interesting.. I never though about using negative margins before
[11:59:31] <phlp> ryanprior: works for me in ff4. with localStorage disabled it says it's null, no security error. not sure what it is
[12:01:43] <PhanLord> is there a good contextmenu plugin that supports submenus ?
[12:03:17] <tucan> hi, does anyone have IE9 ?
[12:03:22] <snover> no, nobody
[12:03:30] <snover> it does not actually exist
[12:04:13] <ryanprior> PhanLord: if your app needs a context with submenus, you're doing it RONG.
[12:04:13] <solidus-river> ew ie
[12:04:15] <tucan> for some strange reason, i feel that IE9 is miscalculating position().left   it's 425 in other browsers but in IE9, it says 0.000095999999
[12:04:30] <tucan> anybody ever experience this?
[12:04:46] <solidus-river> tucan: i've never experienced ie acting oddly compared to other browsers
[12:04:53] <solidus-river> tucan: microsoft will be shocked, you should send them a report
[12:05:28] <solidus-river> tucan: :P
[12:05:53] <solidus-river> tucan: i don't have ie9 though so i cant check it out, do you have a link?
[12:06:00] <tucan> my sample is at http://jleesoft.com/cardones/    when hit the image that says Gift Certificate,  i alert the position and basically the slider doesnt slide to middle
[12:06:36] <solidus-river> tucan:  just fyi you might want to slow that down
[12:06:39] <solidus-river> or use a fade instead of a slide
[12:06:45] <kborchers> ?alert @ tucan
[12:06:45] <bot-t> tucan, Forget alertuse console.log() in Firebug (or your browsers built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[12:06:46] <solidus-river> it would maek it more elegant and less fast food like
[12:07:08] <RichardLynch> phlp: THANK YOU for your suggestion yesterday about $(.tab-content2).show() versus $(".tab-content2").show().children().eq(1).show()   I actually needed 0 since JS is 0-based index, but it did the trick and we're testing all the browser versions now.
[12:07:09] <tucan> okay let me try console.log
[12:07:11] <RichardLynch> phlp++
[12:07:27] <snover> tucan: what version of jquery are you using?
[12:07:29] <solidus-river> i found some wierd code in some jquery i enhereted from another developer
[12:07:40] <solidus-river> i've  been cleaning up thier code and they have horrible unneccisary code all over the place
[12:07:53] <solidus-river> but i dont know enough about wth this is actually doing or not doing to know if i can take it out
[12:07:59] <RichardLynch> Makes me look almost competent at front-end stuff. :-p
[12:08:07] <tucan> snover i use  the latest version on google hosted page
[12:08:17] <snover> tucan: wut?
[12:08:26] <jayd3e> I have a ajax post request getting sent to the server containing stringified JSON.  On the server I get something like this http://pastebin.com/ATNzfUVj.  How would I decode it into a dictionary?
[12:08:30] <jayd3e> or better yet, how do I get it decoded into JSON, so I can stick it right into mongodb
[12:08:31] <snover> that isnt a version number
[12:08:32] <RichardLynch> Hardest part was finding the silly JS in the oh-so-cleverly named Drupal block:    "test inner content"    Where does Marketing find these guys?
[12:08:33] <snover> what VERSION are you using?
[12:08:38] <phlp> RichardLynch: yeah when i tested it i did 1 on accident, thought i copied with 0. glad it worked out for you :)
[12:08:51] <tucan> snover: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js   if i recall  1 means latest version
[12:09:01] <tucan> i dunno the exact version
[12:09:04] <snover> tucan: never use that url.
[12:09:31] <solidus-river> https://gist.github.com/b76d7f0a40d4d8b8c6fa
[12:09:35] <solidus-river> wth is that code doing
[12:09:59] <jethrot> how to return all dom elements with prefix "Pre_"
[12:10:08] <RichardLynch> basically had to grep through a mysqldump just to get clues to where the jQuery lived.  Sigh.  Drupal!
[12:10:22] <solidus-river> i'm thinking it makes any childrean's anchor tags call the current dom elements clickHandler function
[12:10:39] <kborchers> ?selectors @ jethrot
[12:10:39] <bot-t> jethrot, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 13, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[12:10:53] <solidus-river> but i dont understand why on earth he would pass the this object to a function called on the object
[12:10:55] <PhanLord> so no recomendation on contextMenu with submenus :( or a menu plugin with submenus
[12:10:57] <jethrot> kborchers kthx but how
[12:10:58] <solidus-river> why not use this inside that object
[12:11:43] <kborchers> jethrot: seriously you can't read and figure it out .... http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[12:11:53] <jethrot> that's about ATTRIBUTES not DOM ELEMENT IDS
[12:12:06] <tucan> it's really an IE9 problem so its hard to find the answer, the gift cert box should be centered but in IE9 it's at 0
[12:12:26] <solidus-river> tucan: then change your css for ie9
[12:12:37] <yogurt_truck> jethrot: lol ids are attributes, bro
[12:12:40] <kborchers> jethrot: id is an attribute $("div[id^='Pre_']");
[12:12:50] <jethrot> how do I walk those
[12:13:05] <jethrot> (does it return an array)
[12:13:14] <yogurt_truck> jesus
[12:13:16] <solidus-river> jethrot: check it out in a console
[12:13:22] <jethrot> cmon experts you know
[12:13:23] <solidus-river> jethrot: would it make sense for it to return an array
[12:13:27] <jethrot> would be nice
[12:13:29] <phlp> solidus-river: this in that case ends up being the e.data in clickHandler (notice this.element vs e.data.element) and normally this in the event would be the a that is being clicked on but judging by the initial select the a is inside this.element so they are not the same thing?
[12:13:34] <solidus-river> jethrot: yes it would make sense
[12:15:01] <phlp> hopefully that wasnt too confusing
[12:16:00] <solidus-river> phlp: its clear except for one part, whats e.data.element vs this.element, whats the default "data" in an element
[12:16:08] <chovy> i'm not able to access json data returned from my $.post() method.
[12:16:15] <chovy> ie: d.foobar
[12:16:24] <solidus-river> chovy: link?
[12:17:26] <phlp> solidus-river: that data is for the event not the element, it is the second param on live (this) http://api.jquery.com/live#live-eventType-eventData-handler
[12:19:40] <chovy> i had to use .parseJSON for some reason, never had to do that before.
[12:20:16] <solidus-river> chovy: did you declair dataType: 'json', in the post?
[12:20:36] <solidus-river> if your server isn't responding with the correct headers jquery could be guessing the type wrong and interpreting it as text
[12:20:47] <chovy> ah
[12:22:56] <solidus-river> phlp: so that making so when an anchor tag is clicked in an object within the leaves of that widgits dom tree it is sent an app_selected event along with the element of the data and it triggers whatever function is indicated by "value" in that data?
[12:23:43] <solidus-river> i think i'm still a little lost but i'm getting there
[12:24:07] <chovy> is there any difference between $.post(..., dataType: 'json') and .getJSON(...); ?
[12:25:08] <solidus-river> read it
[12:25:20] <solidus-river> its the same, getJSON is just shorthand for a get ajax call that expects json
[12:25:43] <chovy> ok, so there is no diff like POST vs. GET in that sense.
[12:25:45] <chovy> ?
[12:25:52] <thebignoise> is there an easy way to remove [ ] from [text]
[12:25:54] <thebignoise> ?
[12:26:03] <solidus-river> thebignoise: is it a string or an object?
[12:26:15] <thebignoise> solidus-river: string
[12:26:20] <solidus-river> chovy: .ajax defaults to a get request unless you specify the type: parameter
[12:26:29] <phlp> solidus-river: the 'app_selected' event is triggered on the e.data.element which appears to be the widget itself. the value attr is an extra param that is used wherever the app_selected event is handled
[12:26:31] <solidus-river> there is a difference but that method is just convienent for getting json data wich you do a lot
[12:27:04] <solidus-river> phlp: so all that code is doing is making th app_selected event be called on a widged with an anchor tag is clicked within that widget?
[12:27:24] <phlp> yes
[12:27:43] <solidus-river> is app_selected an internal trigger to the widget class?
[12:27:53] <solidus-river> his code never seems to use that event
[12:27:55] <chovy> solidus-river: i don't see 'type' as an option.
[12:28:14] <ajpiano> chovy: $.getJSON does a get $.post(..., {dataType: "json"}) does a post
[12:28:15] <solidus-river> chovy: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:28:34] <solidus-river> chovy: all those are just special types of ajax request
[12:28:40] <thebignoise> add_tag = add_tag.replace('[','');
[12:28:40] <thebignoise> 		add_tag = add_tag.replace(']','');
[12:28:41] <solidus-river> chovy: understand .ajax and the rest will make sense
[12:28:43] <thebignoise> thats how im doing it
[12:28:50] <thebignoise> but that seems like overkill?
[12:29:03] <chovy> ajpiano: $.getJSON does a post with data?
[12:29:11] <ajpiano> .... no
[12:29:17] <phlp> solidus-river: it's not internal. there is no .bind('app_selected') ?
[12:29:23] <solidus-river> chovy: no it does a get
[12:29:25] <ajpiano> read what i wrote again, this time put a comma in the middle
[12:29:37] <solidus-river> phlp: nope, maybe he used it in an earlier iteration and now its dead
[12:29:43] <solidus-river> phlp: this guy was awesome about cleaning up legacy code
[12:29:45] <chovy> ajpiano: got it. thanks.
[12:30:09] <chovy> so $.post will do a POST
[12:30:21] <chovy> i just need the dataType: 'json'
[12:30:41] <solidus-river> chovy: yes, $.post, is equivalent to $.ajax({ type: 'POST'})
[12:31:12] <ajpiano> chovy: you just do "json" as the last parm to $.post, not an object
[12:31:24] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[12:32:27] <littulb> trying to read a simple cml file and append the values - can someone take a look at this and lend a hand http://jsfiddle.net/littulb/znYYk/
[12:32:38] <littulb> cml = xml
[12:35:03] <chovy> ajpiano: thanks.
[12:35:34] <chovy> littulb: parseXml?
[12:36:06] <littulb> chovy, is something wrong with that?
[12:36:21] <chovy> i don't see the function.
[12:36:28] <chovy> and you're looking for Food, which I also don't see.
[12:37:09] <chovy> and that xml is case sensivite , Food is lowercase (food)
[12:37:23] <chovy> look at .each too
[12:37:24] <ch3mical> find is case-insensitive
[12:37:29] <chovy> you need two params.
[12:37:48] <ajpiano> ch3mical: uhhhh...
[12:37:51] <ajpiano> that's not true
[12:37:59] <ajpiano> littulb, there's a jQuery.parseXML function
[12:38:13] <ajpiano> there isn't just a magic global function called parseXml
[12:38:48] <ch3mical> ajpiano: I use it all the time and I never have to match case
[12:40:24] <ajpiano> ch3mical http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/fX9BL/
[12:42:18] <gouki__> anyone around for a jquery ui question?
[12:42:33] <kborchers> ?ask @ gouki__
[12:42:33] <bot-t> gouki__, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:42:53] <phlp> littulb: http://jsfiddle.net/znYYk/1
[12:43:59] <gouki__> the issue im having is when opening up multiple modal dialogues on top of each other, the overlay background just gets darker and darker.. i cant for the life of me figure out how to get around this.
[12:44:14] <gouki__> jquery ui modals that is
[12:44:49] <kborchers> gouki__: that is because you are applying overlay over overlay, it's going to get darker. why does it matter?
[12:45:18] <gouki__> its just a visual thing.. functionally it works fine.. just seems like i should be able to not have to do that
[12:45:55] <gouki__> like check if another modal is already open and if so, not apply the overlay
[12:46:38] <ajpiano> gouki__: but the new modal has to cover up the old one for the new one to actually simulate modality
[12:46:40] <kborchers> gouki__: nope, if you want modal over modal, without another overlay, your first modal dialog would still be accessible. if this is not an issue, then you could do one modal first, then do regular dialogs after but you can't control which ones the user has access to then
[12:47:40] <phlp> you could also set the background of the second overlay to transparent
[12:47:43] <Xeon06_> How can I check whether a selector didn't return any elements? Does it really only return an array?
[12:47:45] <kborchers> gouki__: either way, a bunch of modals probably isn't a great user experience anyway. probably a better way to handle that
[12:47:51] <ajpiano> Xeon06_: check .length
[12:47:52] <gouki__> good idea
[12:48:02] <Xeon06_> ajpiano: So it's an array. Thanks!
[12:48:12] <ajpiano> it's not an array
[12:48:31] <ajpiano> it's a jquery object, which has an array inside of it, and it has a property .length that corrseponds to that array's length
[12:48:32] <ajpiano> :)
[12:48:45] <Xeon06_> How does it look like an array when console.logged?
[12:48:50] <ch3mical> ajpiano: I'm talking about using find on XML
[12:49:27] <ajpiano> Xeon06_: i promise you it's a jquery object
[12:49:30] <ajpiano> yes it prints like an array
[12:49:41] <ajpiano> but try calling $(".foo").join(",")
[12:49:42] <ch3mical> ajpiano: I work with an API we developed which gives XML with camelcase, etc, but for find I just use all lowercase
[12:49:44] <ajpiano> it ain't gonna happen
[12:49:46] <Xeon06_> ajpiano: Is there some kind of magic overload for console.log?
[12:49:53] <ch3mical> *shrug*
[12:50:08] <ajpiano> ch3mical i never so anything with xml, i'm surprised that .find works differently, but hey
[12:50:25] <ajpiano> Xeon06_:  i'm not sure
[12:50:40] <Xeon06_> ajpiano: Cool, thanks for the help
[12:50:52] <ch3mical> ajpiano: yeah, I had initially assumed it was case-sensitive, but noticed at some point that it was still matching even when case didn't
[12:51:05] <ch3mical> ajpiano: so then I stopped bothering to match case :P
[12:51:19] <ch3mical> ajpiano: though I probably should, just in case .find ever changes. lol
[12:51:31] <ajpiano> that's what i'm thinking
[12:51:48] <ajpiano> it's like you're saving yourself 1/20th of a second of presing the shift key
[12:52:06] <ajpiano> and introducing inconsistencies just cause you can :p
[12:53:00] <ch3mical> ajpiano: lol :P
[12:53:20] <ch3mical> ajpiano: that what happens when I've been programming for 18 hours straight
[12:53:39] <sadmicrowave> not even a potty break?
[12:53:45] <ch3mical> Catheter
[12:53:52] <sadmicrowave> LIAR!
[12:53:57] <GeO`> evening !
[12:53:58] <ch3mical> You got me.
[12:54:00] <ch3mical> :P
[12:54:20] <sadmicrowave> your not dedicated enough like us 'REAL' programmers
[12:54:24] <ch3mical> rofl
[12:54:29] <sadmicrowave> ;)
[12:54:44] <ch3mical> But wait, you write javascript, so you couldn't possibly be a "real" programmer ;)
[12:54:46] <GeO`> I'm using an animation on "scrollTop", but I don't want it to trigger the .scroll() event. How can I do that ?
[12:54:55] <ch3mical> javascript isn't a "real" language
[12:55:07] <sadmicrowave> LIAR!
[12:55:11] <GeO`> my animation is done with .animate({scrollTop : value});
[12:55:12] <sadmicrowave> is my response
[12:55:55] <ch3mical> I'm obviously being very sarcastic ;p
[12:56:29] <sadmicrowave> really? I couldn't tell, you had no inflection or emphasis in your text
[12:56:43] <ch3mical> Me too
[12:57:25] <sadmicrowave> GeO`, don't use scrollTop if you don't want the scroll event to trigger
[12:57:36] <sadmicrowave> easy solution
[12:58:02] <GeO`> and how could I make the div scroll without using scrollTop then
[12:58:35] <sadmicrowave> GeO`, check your terminology, you probably mean 'how could I make the div animate...'
[12:58:42] <kborchers> GeO`: why does it matter if the scroll event fires
[12:59:05] <thebignoise> how do you pass in a var as a string
[12:59:08] <sadmicrowave> kborchers, it sounds like he wants to move the div on the page but keep the page from scrolling
[12:59:25] <GeO`> I think I need to explain my situation
[12:59:25] <sadmicrowave> thebignoise, pass the var in from where and to where?
[12:59:31] <sadmicrowave> GeO`, sounds like it
[12:59:46] <phlp> GeO`: just check .is(':animated') in the scroll handler
[12:59:53] <thebignoise> sadmicrowave: i have a function called noDups(theString)
[12:59:56] <GeO`> I got a div with overflow-y:auto;    with a lot of lines in it, which represent rounds
[13:00:07] <GeO`> I got a function which makes the div scroll, a line per second
[13:00:10] <gouki__> single modal with additional regular dialogues worked like a champ.. thanks for the idea
[13:00:11] <thebignoise> and then i call theString.indexOf(string)
[13:00:19] <thebignoise> but theString isn't a string
[13:00:25] <GeO`> but I want to know when the user scrolls _himself_ the div, to stop the animation
[13:00:28] <kborchers> gouki__: :)
[13:00:34] <GeO`> is it clearer?
[13:00:44] <solidus-river> in widget's do attributs with an _ in front of them that are functions get called at a certain time automatically?
[13:00:46] <kborchers> GeO`see phlp's response ^^^
[13:00:53] <thebignoise> sadmicrowave: make sense?
[13:00:56] <ch3mical> thebignoise: I don't think indexOf works on strings anyway
[13:01:23] <ajpiano> solidus-river: they are private methods (by convention) and they are called internally yes
[13:01:24] <thebignoise> ch3mical: is there a method for substrings
[13:01:32] <ajpiano> ch3mical, yes, of course, indexOf works on strings
[13:01:33] <ajpiano> ....
[13:01:44] <ajpiano> ?eval "foo".indexOf("o")
[13:01:45] <bot-t> ajpiano: 1
[13:01:56] <ch3mical> I thought that was arrays only... my mistake :)
[13:02:00] <ajpiano> ya
[13:02:02] <sadmicrowave> ch3mical, yes it does, thebignoise, make sure 'theString' is what you think it is before you pass it in the function
[13:02:02] <ch3mical> I never use it
[13:02:09] <ajpiano> it's Array.indexOf that isn't xbrowser :(
[13:02:23] <gnarf> actually indexOf on arrays isn't c
[13:02:23] <ch3mical> ah
[13:02:26] <gnarf> what ajpiano said
[13:02:28] <sadmicrowave> ajpiano, badass, I didn't know you could use the bot like that
[13:02:33] <GeO`> phlp : awesome, thanks
[13:02:39] <ch3mical> Guess I had that backwards
[13:02:56] <thebignoise> sadmicrowave: oh shit i was doing it backwards
[13:02:59] <ch3mical> Which browsers does that not work on, out of curiosity?
[13:03:27] <gnarf> ies
[13:03:42] <gnarf> older ones not using JS1.6+
[13:03:42] <ch3mical> Figures
[13:04:02] <kborchers> ch3mical: did you really have to ask which browsers :p
[13:04:20] <K1ng> any idea how to decode this javascript? http://codepad.org/BpmgEcMz
[13:04:23] <ch3mical> Apparently not ;)
[13:06:11] <littulb> phlp, Thanks bro!!
[13:06:13] <gnarf> K1ng: have you tried running the eval?
[13:06:25] <K1ng> no
[13:06:34] <K1ng> one of my client gave it to me
[13:06:34] <gnarf> or rather, everything but the eval()
[13:06:47] <gnarf> it should be a string which is "better"
[13:06:48] <GeO`> phlp unfortunately it doesn't fit my issue
[13:07:01] <phlp> why is that
[13:07:11] <GeO`> I need to stop the animation WHEN the animation is on AND the scroll is made by the user
[13:07:18] <GeO`> I need to detect this precise event
[13:07:41] <GeO`> the user's scroll is made during the animation so your method doesn't help
[13:08:37] <phlp> stop the animation on click?
[13:09:10] <gadlol> hi, i have a page with lots o fdsata and among that a table with id = myTable.  How to remove all other elements and leave only the table with id = MyTable????
[13:09:11] <GeO`> clicking on the scroll bar is taken into account ?
[13:09:36] <solidus-river> can you prepend to a div or only append
[13:10:19] <kborchers> GeO`: I would store some variable outside of the scroll handler that is on when the animated scroll runs and off when not. then check that in the handler if your handler fires while it's on, they scrolled during animation and you can stop the animation. just an idea, never done it
[13:11:13] <GeO`> kborchers the handler is always fired during the animation, since the animation consists in scrolling
[13:12:10] <gadlol> please anyone?
[13:12:14] <gadlol> hi, i have a page with lots o fdsata and among that a table with id = myTable.  How to remove all other elements and leave only the table with id = MyTable????
[13:13:12] <thebignoise> http://pastie.org/2255927 -- can someone tell me why this always return false?
[13:13:31] <sadmicrowave> gadlol what about $('body').children().not( $('#myTable') ).remove()
[13:13:40] <thebignoise> add_tag is set i just didnt paste it
[13:13:44] <gadlol> wow let me check it
[13:13:44] <ajpiano> thebignoise, cause you're returning from the .each inner iterator function, not the noDups fnction
[13:14:13] <thebignoise> ajpiano: oh! doh i knew i was overlooking the obvious
[13:14:18] <thebignoise> ajpiano: thank you
[13:14:25] <ajpiano> gadlol: try this.  var table = $("#myTable").detach();  $(document.body).empty(); table.appendTo(document.body);
[13:15:08] <ajpiano> cause sadmicrowave's way assumes they are children which we don't know is true
[13:15:13] <sadmicrowave> ajpiano, I like it, where does jquery place var table in the interim before you add it back?
[13:15:21] <ajpiano> memory
[13:15:41] <ajpiano> sadmicrowave: same as if you do document.createElement("div")
[13:15:42] <sadmicrowave> i didn't know you could detach elements like that, neat
[13:15:44] <ajpiano> but then don't put it into the DOM
[13:15:56] <sadmicrowave> yea, that makes sense
[13:15:58] <ajpiano> sadmicrowave: you can do the same thing with remove.... var foo = $("bar").remove()
[13:16:09] <ajpiano> but remove will remove all the handlers and data attached to the element, and detach will preserve it
[13:16:19] <sadmicrowave> very cool
[13:18:32] <ch3mical> phlp: I still can't get it quite right, do you mind taking another look? http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/PJZmv/18/
[13:19:35] <kborchers> ajpiano: is detach effectively .clone() then .remove() just in one method?
[13:19:37] <ch3mical> phlp: I think it's a bit off because I'm using a span with an image, as opposed to a text "X"
[13:20:51] <ch3mical> kborchers: no, it just puts the object in memory and removes it from the DOM, so you can put it back in the DOM later if you need to, remove can't be put back in the DOM because it will no longer exist (as I understand it)
[13:21:24] <ajpiano> either of them can be put back in the dom
[13:21:30] <GeO`> another issue, can I detect if a click event has been generated by click() or by an user?
[13:21:33] <kborchers> ch3mical: right which is where the clone() comes in
[13:21:47] <ajpiano> kborchers, detach is remove but without destroying the handlers and data, there is no cloning involved
[13:22:00] <kborchers> ajpiano: ahh, i see
[13:22:02] <kborchers> cool
[13:22:46] <ch3mical> ajpiano: ah ok, but just the data is lost
[13:22:49] <ch3mical> +events
[13:22:56] <jbrokc_> calling $("input#foo").focu() highilights all of the text within the input box. how do I just place the cursor at the end of the input with no text selected?
[13:23:33] <ch3mical> Anyone want to help me get this stupid "clear textbox" element working right? http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/PJZmv/18/
[13:23:36] <jbrokc_>  err - .focus() ***
[13:23:55] <ch3mical> The clearing part isn't the problem, it's the showing/hiding of the element
[13:24:23] <gadlol> thanks a lot <sadmicrowave> and <ajpiano> both work fine
[13:24:41] <sadmicrowave> glad to hear it
[13:25:11] <sadmicrowave> although, for what it's worth, I like ajpiano's suggestion better
[13:25:27] <ajpiano> me too
[13:25:47] <GeO`> another issue, can I detect if a click event has been generated by click() or by an user?
[13:26:05] <phlp> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/PJZmv/19
[13:26:06] <ajpiano> the first is like, you go to a flea market, browse for a while, and then find what you're looking for, and leave
[13:26:16] <ch3mical> oops my CSS was wrong, here's the update http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/PJZmv/20/
[13:26:25] <ajpiano> the second is like, you show up at a flea market and everything instantly vaporizes except for what you were looking for.
[13:26:57] <sadmicrowave> and the most awesome analogy points for the day go to ajpiano
[13:27:16] * ajpiano is running out of room on his mantle
[13:27:50] <sadmicrowave> i said 'points' not 'trophy'
[13:28:12] <sadmicrowave> your mantle space remains un-altered
[13:28:18] <solidus-river> what does the second argument to a look up do?
[13:28:26] <ajpiano> sadmicrowave: lol
[13:28:30] <sadmicrowave> :)
[13:28:33] <solidus-river> $('#user_name', thisVariable?);
[13:28:40] <ajpiano> solidus-river: it's an element to limit the scope of the search
[13:28:49] <sadmicrowave> like 'this'
[13:29:16] <ch3mical> Do jqui images not show up in jsfiddle when you include jqui?
[13:29:18] <sadmicrowave> $('#user_name', this) will only select elements that match #user_name within the currently selected element
[13:30:05] <sadmicrowave> ch3mical, probably not considering including the jqui plugin code does not include the jqui image directory
[13:30:34] <ch3mical> sadmicrowave: right, but jsfiddle has a checkbox for including jqui, so you would think they had accounted for that
[13:30:35] <ajpiano> ch3mical: they don't, you have to include the css as a dep separately
[13:31:13] <ch3mical> ajpiano: so the jqui option in jsfiddle is broken?
[13:31:20] <ajpiano> no
[13:31:22] <solidus-river> i dont understand what hte difference is between an element, an element.data and an element.data.element
[13:31:45] <ajpiano> ch3mical: they choose not to include the css there, that pane on the left is for js only
[13:31:58] <ch3mical> oh I see what you mean
[13:32:06] <dualcore> is there a way to tell what direction the mouse leaves an element?  i need like .mouseOutRight/Left

[13:32:11] <GeO`> how to use the eventData in .click( [eventData,] handler(eventObject) )  ?
[13:33:04] <GeO`> is it a variable which will be provided to the handler?
[13:33:13] <jbrokc_> calling $("input#foo").focus() highilights all of the text within the input box. how do I just place the cursor at the end of the input with no text selected?
[13:33:48] <ajpiano> solidus-river: an element is a DOM element.  in jQuery terms, the data is a an object associated with that element via jQuery.cache.  that data can contain any other arbitrary properties, like a reference to another element
[13:33:50] <GeO`> nvm I found it
[13:34:03] <Pfeifakopf455> hi. how could i check, if a cookie has expired?
[13:34:23] <sadmicrowave> ch3mical, it's not broken, if you include jqui and do some script for .dialog() you will see the dialog images
[13:34:42] <solidus-river> ajpiano: so if i need to get this.element to get the element, what does this refer too? The jquery function?
[13:34:50] <Pfeifakopf455> if ($.cookie('contact') ????????
[13:34:55] <solidus-river> er, the jquery object associated with the element?
[13:35:05] <solidus-river> and then this.element is the element that the jquery object is attached too?
[13:35:09] <ajpiano> solidus-river: thre is no such thing as "the jQuery object associated with the elemtn"
[13:35:29] <ajpiano> if you want to get to the data, you can do $.data(elem, "key") or $(elem).data("key")
[13:35:44] <solidus-river> ajpiano: so if this.element is the element, what is this
[13:35:58] <solidus-river> this.element is the element, this.data is the data.. this === ?
[13:36:20] <ajpiano> solidus-river: are we talking about jQuery UI widges here?
[13:36:26] <solidus-river> ajpiano: yes
[13:36:28] <ajpiano> oh
[13:36:36] <ajpiano> 'this' is the actual widget instance
[13:37:28] <solidus-river> ok, i think this is starting to come together, and then this.element.data would be the information inside of the element?
[13:37:53] <ajpiano> i'm not sure where element.data would be coming from.. tbh
[13:38:19] <ch3mical> ok, here maybe this will help: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/PJZmv/22/

[14:00:07] <danieliser> i need to have a set of input fields for phone numbers, label and number.. with an add new button to add another set of fields.. what is the best way to serialize this information? assign them a name like phone[]?
[14:00:41] <dr34mc0d3r> anyone have a page using jquery, flot (pie chart), ajax to update the pie chart? i cant get my pie chart to update even trying to hand set the data.
[14:01:15] <danieliser> might need to recall the function to generate the graph after you change the data
[14:01:24] <danieliser> callback
[14:01:35] <dr34mc0d3r> you recall an example?
[14:02:19] <danieliser> no.. not for what you are using.. but i had to do something similar to make form validation work in my easymodal plugin for wordpress
[14:03:06] <danieliser> basically if you change the data that makes the chart the function doesnt know to run again.. you have to call it again
[14:03:47] <dr34mc0d3r> ok
[14:03:57] <danieliser> just put call_flot(target); at the end of you function to change the data obviously change it to the same thing you used to call it on page load
[14:05:01] <phlp> dr34mc0d3r: found this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5767727
[14:09:11] <ch3mical> Hmm is there a way to delay .hover? (as in delay it detecting a hover event)
[14:09:58] <taar779> Is there a way to edit which way .show() and .hide() animate?
[14:10:32] <ch3mical> I'm using hover and fadeTo to alter the opacity on my "clear textbox" function, but the hover event is preventing the element from being hidden (using hide) because it detects hover
[14:10:53] <ch3mical> taar779: show and hide don't animate, see ?fadeTo
[14:10:54] <bot-t> taar779, .fadeTo(duration, opacity, [callback]): Adjust the opacity of the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/fadeTo/
[14:10:58] <ch3mical> taar779: or see ?animate
[14:10:59] <bot-t> taar779, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[14:12:49] <danieliser> ch3mical you can use setTimeout()
[14:13:13] <ch3mical> To delay detecting the hover event?
[14:13:31] <ch3mical> I don't want to delay what's IN the hover event's function
[14:13:46] <danieliser> inside the hovers first function use setTimeout(function(){ // do your hover function here }, 1000 // time to pause);
[14:14:42] <danieliser> what is it you are trying to accomplish? if you add .stop(true,true) to the beggining of the hovers second function you wont get anything
[14:14:44] <ch3mical> Again, I'm not trying to delay what is executed by hover
[14:15:36] <danieliser> not sure what you are looking for then? this method works the similar to hoverIntent plugin..
[14:16:15] <danieliser> are you trying to delay the hover effect from being applied?
[14:16:40] <phlp> ch3mical: are you saying it doesnt hide when the text is cleared because the mouse is over it? just check in the hover if the input is empty, if so dont do the fading
[14:16:55] <ch3mical> danieliser: the problem is that there is a click event on the element that also has a hover event, so when the click even fires it tries to hide the element, but because the mouse is over it (from clicking) it also detects hover and therefore the element gets shown again
[14:17:31] <ch3mical> phlp: that might work. I was actually about to try using css to do it, but looks like that isn't working
[14:18:41] <danieliser> ch3mical: is there a .show() on the element in the hover functions?
[14:19:12] <ch3mical> danieliser: fadeTo, but that will also show display:none elements
[14:20:07] <danieliser> ch3mical: use the setTimeout() method i metioned earlier on the hover out function.. set the time out to be something that allows you to get off
[14:20:36] <ch3mical> danieliser: the problem is not hover out
[14:20:50] <ch3mical> Not that there is such a thing, but I get your meaning
[14:20:53] <GeO`> I have another issue (again)
[14:20:57] <GeO`> please read http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[14:20:58] <danieliser> and on the click function add a class .. then use a check in the hover functions.. if hasclass() dont do anything
[14:21:06] <GeO`> and the "Example: To pass arbitrary data to an event:"
[14:21:22] <GeO`> I'm doing exactly what it says, but the data is not passed along...
[14:21:25] <ch3mical> phlp: that didn't work :/
[14:22:16] <danieliser> cg3nucakL try on the click function add a class .. then use a check in the hover functions.. if hasclass() dont do anything
[14:23:04] <danieliser> or try hoverIntent instead of hover.. clever plugin might not fire the event right away with the right settings
[14:23:22] <ch3mical> phlp: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/PJZmv/23/
[14:23:36] <DannyZB> I use ui-draggable on a tr element inside a table with "overflow:auto" ( doesn't let overflow get outside it)
[14:23:38] <ch3mical> This tiny little button has become a huge pain
[14:23:47] <DannyZB> 'thing is it can't be dragged outside the table
[14:23:52] <DannyZB> what can I do about it?
[14:23:53] <danieliser> i need to have unlimited sets of phone/label fields and serialize them with jquery.. how can i do this?
[14:24:31] <ch3mical> danieliser: have you tried serialize or serializearray?
[14:24:52] <ch3mical> danieliser: see ?serialize
[14:24:53] <bot-t> danieliser, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[14:24:58] <phlp> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/PJZmv/24
[14:24:58] <danieliser> i can easily add more fields but how do i need to name them to get them serialized into an array?
[14:25:07] <danieliser> sorry i know how to serialize a form..
[14:25:17] <cognitived> i have an ajax request that accept a json string. that json string has an object array and for some reason it is sorting the object array when it parses the json. any ideas?
[14:25:27] <danieliser> just not sure how to set an array of fields up
[14:25:30] <ch3mical> danieliser: doesn't matter, give them any name
[14:25:45] <ch3mical> phone1, phone2, phone3, etc
[14:26:07] <danieliser> ch3mical: then post processing is tougher.. would doing them like checkboxes phone[] work?
[14:27:08] <ch3mical> [type="checkbox"] [name*="phone"]
[14:27:23] <ch3mical> That selector will find all checkboxes that contain "phone" in the name
[14:27:30] <ch3mical> Is that what you want?
[14:27:42] <danieliser> second question would be if i can assign them like phone[] can i take it further and do phone[][label] and phone[][number]?
[14:28:23] <danieliser> idealy i would like an array like [label] => number
[14:28:29] <danieliser> so i can loop it
[14:28:44] <danieliser> can that be done with 2 fields?
[14:28:46] <ch3mical> danieliser: see ?each
[14:28:46] <bot-t> danieliser, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[14:29:11] <danieliser> i know how to use the basic functions.. just not sure how to put them together for this
[14:29:21] <ch3mical> phlp: that doesn't seem to be working at all
[14:29:44] <ch3mical> danieliser: it would be easier to give you an example if I see and example of what you're working with
[14:29:49] <ch3mical> an*
[14:29:53] <danieliser> one sec
[14:33:59] <phlp> ch3mical: yeah looks like it has problems in anything but firefox. the one you sent the click event isnt even happening?
[14:34:39] <ch3mical> phlp: in the version I sent it clears the box, but the icon stays
[14:35:13] <phlp> ch3mical: not in ie8
[14:35:51] <ch3mical> Ok, well I need to make it work x-browser
[14:36:35] <ch3mical> Working in IE9 except for the icon reappearing
[14:37:08] <ch3mical> I think I can live with it not working in IE8

[14:39:01] <ch3mical> There we go!:)
[14:39:10] <ch3mical> Thanks yet again ;)
[14:39:16] <phlp> np :)
[14:39:37] <ch3mical> My gawd. I think I can finally move on
[14:39:37] <ch3mical> lol
[14:39:44] <ch3mical> I figured that would be so simple
[14:41:19] <danieliser> http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/zfu5N/1/
[14:41:56] <ch3mical> danieliser: alright, so what is your goal with this?
[14:44:19] <danieliser> there will be an add button to add more numbers.. each with a label and number.. i need to get this data into an array like array([label[ => number, [label] => number) or something similar so i can foreach it
[14:44:39] <danieliser> it will then be searialized in php for mysql storage
[14:47:10] <enleth> Hi, quick question. I need to apply something to every 3rd and every 3n+1st element of a selected list (NOT every whatever-th child of whatever parent, so nth-child is out), but :eq doesn't seem to support such equations. What are my options? Google results are flooded with people suggesting nth-child over and over again to the point of uselessness.
[14:47:40] <enleth> "selected list" meaning "the list of whatever elements my expression selected", not HTML list or something like that.
[14:48:39] <ajpiano> enleth, you could try something like $("foo").filter(function(i, f) {  return i % 3 == <= 1;   }
[14:48:43] <ajpiano> );
[14:50:51] <ajpiano> you're correct in everything you said about eq not taking a complex selection like that and :nth-child not being appropriate for your situation :)
[14:51:01] <enleth> ajpiano: yeah, that's roughly what I was thinking about, I was just hoping there is some more elegant way. It's a pity eq() doesn't support expressions.
[14:51:11] <ajpiano> enleth: it's a pity :eq exists :p
[14:51:20] <enleth> ajpiano: why is that?
[14:51:30] <ch3mical> danieliser: hmm.. gimme a min
[14:51:33] <ajpiano> enleth: the custom non-QSA selectors in jQuery (the positional ones... :eq :first :last) are a real bear
[14:51:39] <phlp> $(this).find(':nth-child(3n+1)')
[14:51:41] <ajpiano> to support and maintain, as well as perforamnce
[14:52:02] <ajpiano> phlp: he's trying to filter by its index in the collection, not by position int he dom
[14:52:27] <ajpiano> enleth: to the point that http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix#Custom_Selector_Improvements_or_Bug_Fixes
[14:52:56] <phlp> ah i see
[14:53:46] <ch3mical> danieliser: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/zfu5N/2/ this will put them in arrays, then you can cross reference them
[14:54:03] <enleth> ajpiano: but when they're needed - and sometimes they just are, period - people would have to come up with some crutches involving filter() anyway, like the one you wrote above.
[14:54:16] <Fretta> any ideas why the title element is still displayed on hover even though I try and clear it at line 9 http://pastie.org/2256385
[14:54:24] <ajpiano> well yeah, that's why we're not planning to deprecate them
[14:54:31] <ajpiano> but if you can avoid using them, it's preferable
[14:54:45] <enleth> Isn't it better when they at least use proven crutches that were written and tested by professionals instead of coming up with (often very crappy) custom code?
[14:54:55] <ajpiano> sure, you get a little bit of "brevity" cause it's a "selector" but it's forcing a lot more processing and filtering
[14:55:07] <enleth> The processing will be there anyway.
[14:55:18] <ajpiano> i don't know if i think that doing a bit of array iteration is something that we should be considering a hard task :p
[14:55:27] <ajpiano> enleth: not necessarily
[14:56:08] <ajpiano> the perf cost of the thing i posted vs the the perf cost of a hypothetical $("div:eq(3n)")
[14:56:15] <ajpiano> is just way lower
[14:56:46] <ajpiano> enleth: on the other hand, it's not *entirely* unreasonable :)
[14:57:00] <ajpiano> it's something you might want to propose as an enhancement to go along with the rewrite that's mentioned there
[14:57:14] <enleth> Is that due to the expression processing, or the selection process itself?
[14:57:30] <ajpiano> the selection process itself
[14:57:41] <ajpiano> as soon as you start using custom selectors instead of QSA compatible ones
[14:57:48] <ajpiano> you have to go through Sizzle instead of native methods
[14:58:47] <enleth> I haven't been paying that much attention - isn't this about as fast (slow?) as using filter()?
[14:59:11] <danieliser> ch3mical: that will work can just loop them both
[14:59:39] <jbrokc_> has anyone else here used jquery.hotkeys.js ? i'm having trouble when i bind a keypress to focus on an input field, it replaces the value of the input field with the key bound
[15:00:02] <danieliser> ch3mical: any way to include this in the serialized form data?
[15:00:03] <jbrokc_> this is when calling $("input#foo").focus() within the function object of .bind, however
[15:00:25] <ajpiano> enleth: no because you don't get the speed of $("div") anymore
[15:00:32] <ajpiano> at least, i believe that is the case
[15:02:05] <enleth> Honestly, I've been concerned with selector performance only when something is visibly slow in testing or when the customer absolutely requires the thing to work under IE7, which, I think, forces jQuery to fall back to crutch code for every other selector out there
[15:02:10] <ch3mical> danieliser: it's already in the serialized data
[15:02:25] <ch3mical> danieliser: the arrays are built from that
[15:02:45] <enleth> But it's still good to know, I guess
[15:03:59] <ch3mical> danieliser: you might want to just include serialize as well as serializearray, to get the post string
[15:05:16] <ch3mical> danieliser: example: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/zfu5N/3/ so just handle the data in php at that point
[15:05:27] <ch3mical> (console log)
[15:10:16] <danieliser> checking that out now..
[15:10:24] <enleth> Ah, one more thing. It looks like the nth-child CSS selector is not natively supported in IE up to and including 8 - so jQuery will use Sizzle for that as well, right?
[15:13:52] <eddiemonge> right

[19:21:25] <lenswipe> djQuery, i cant cos it would require me to upload ckeditor there
[19:22:18] <djQuery> lenswipe: no it would just require u to link to the ckeditor js and css files
[19:22:25] <lenswipe> which are where?
[19:22:27] <djQuery> look under additional resources
[19:22:31] <lenswipe> ok
[19:22:36] <djQuery> lenswipe: well where did you get them
[19:22:52] <lenswipe> ckeditor.com
[19:22:59] <lenswipe> i cant find "additional resources" though
[19:24:12] * sadblender will it blend
[19:25:13] <djQuery> The will it blend is one of the best marketing campaigns to never have been on tv
[19:26:12] <lenswipe> djQuery, right...
[19:26:38] <djQuery> lenswipe: maybe you would have better luck with jsbin.com then.
[19:26:45] <saddishwasher> sadblender no it wont
[19:26:51] <djQuery> I kinda like it better myself
[19:27:44] <djQuery> lenswipe: and sorry it was Add Resources
[19:28:22] <lenswipe> add resources on jsfiddle?
[19:28:38] * djQuery have lost all hope on this issue
[19:28:44] <lenswipe> :(
[19:29:06] <saddishwasher> lol
[19:29:22] <lenswipe> djQuery,  http://95.146.91.121/resume
[19:29:28] <lenswipe> err
[19:29:31] <lenswipe> djQuery,  http://95.146.91.121/resume/blog
[19:29:49] <lenswipe> that textbox should be a ckeditor instance
[19:30:20] <djQuery> lenswipe: check the order of your scripts
[19:30:50] <lenswipe> ok
[19:31:23] <djQuery> lenswipe: I would imagine that ckeditor/adapters/jquery would be dependent on jquery.js
[19:31:28] <djQuery> allready being there
[19:31:31] <lenswipe> its still like that
[19:32:16] <lenswipe> djinni, another error to add to the list now
[19:32:27] <lenswipe> apparently "CKEDITOR is not defined" ....
[19:32:28] <lenswipe> O_O
[19:33:02] <lenswipe> ok now im getting no warnings or errors, its just not loading
[19:33:03] <lenswipe> >:[
[19:33:33] <saddishwasher> dont be mad
[19:33:58] <djQuery> lenswipe: those red error message are hard to read on that background
[19:34:10] <lenswipe> yes i know
[19:34:13] <lenswipe> wait which ones?
[19:34:16] <lenswipe> the ones on the contact form?
[19:34:57] <djQuery> y
[19:35:03] <lenswipe> yeah i know
[19:35:07] <lenswipe> its the frontend framework
[19:35:17] <lenswipe> i dont know if you can/i havent got around to fixing it
[19:35:21] <djQuery> lol and your stpetters church is givin a Why am i seeing htis page
[19:35:28] <imanc> long polling + jquery.. discuss
[19:35:40] <lenswipe> yeah its the holding pge
[19:36:13] <lenswipe> djQuery, what do you think of my resume site apart from that?
[19:37:16] <danieliser> djQuery: ok so i holds the objects and i can check i.name to find the correct ones.. but how do i remove them?
[19:37:32] <saddishwasher> lenswipe, it looks nice
[19:37:35] <lenswipe> ty
[19:37:45] <lenswipe> saddishwasher, thanks
[19:38:05] <wirehack7> how to fade the background color of an element?
[19:38:07] <saddishwasher> i like the blue wrapper banner at the top
[19:38:12] <depressedtoaster> :)
[19:38:27] <saddishwasher> fyi im on iphone safari and it looks good
[19:38:33] <depressedtoaster> yay :D
[19:38:41] <luite> what's the standrd way to display an error or info box like those shown on the themeroller page?
[19:38:43] <depressedtoaster> i should make an iphone version lol
[19:38:45] <depressedtoaster> cba though
[19:39:34] <saddishwasher> these sad kitchen appliance names are catchy huh!?
[19:40:00] <luite> the examples on the themeroller page look nice, but have lots of inline style
[19:40:18] <ajpiano> luite: that's the jquery ui dialog
[19:41:16] <luite> ajpiano: really? I mean those "Hey! Sample ui-state-highlight style." and "Alert: Sample ui-state-error style." boxes
[19:41:18] <depressedtoaster> saddishwasher, yeah
[19:41:28] <ajpiano> oh those duders on the right there
[19:41:32] <ajpiano> you just manually apply the classes
[19:42:13] <djQuery> danieliser: just dont return those
[19:42:26] <luite> ajpiano: yeah not just classes there though, they use this: style="float: left; margin-right: .3em;", style="margin-top: 20px; padding: 0 .7em;"
[19:43:11] <luite> looks clunky to do all that with inline styles
[19:43:18] <djQuery> sadtoaster: get rid of the social networking
[19:43:41] <djQuery> sadtoaster: unless u are going for a marketing job
[19:43:42] <ajpiano> luite: that's cause those classes don't control anything else about the element besides border/background/text colour
[19:44:50] <ajpiano> so anything else you'd just be positioning yourself however you want
[19:44:52] <saddishwasher> djQuery, sadtoaster i agree
[19:45:26] <luite> ajpiano: yeah I tried adding those to my box, but I had problems with a newline after the icon
[19:45:51] <ajpiano> luite: how'd you style the icon, what classes did you put on
[19:46:25] <saddishwasher> later guys
[19:46:37] <djQuery> sadtoaster: also try going to your local unemeployment office for a tutorial on putting together a good resume
[19:46:48] <luite> ajpiano: ui-icon ui-icon-info
[19:46:49] <saddishwasher> lol
[19:46:55] <ajpiano> hmm.. on a span or a div?
[19:46:56] <saddishwasher> lmao
[19:47:07] <saddishwasher> rofl
[19:47:09] <luite> ajpiano: span, but its display style is set to block by those classes
[19:47:27] <danieliser> djQuery: ok so if i dont return them and log the final results it returns unidentified.. here is the return [Object { name="firstname"}, Object { name="lastname"}, Object { name="email"}, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined].. how can i actually remove them? they still get posted to the ajax as undefined
[19:47:41] <saddishwasher> djQuery, freaking hilarious
[19:47:48] <ajpiano> luite: hmm, yeah, i think you just need to write some css to make them be inline if you want to use 'em as inline elems
[19:49:04] <nimbu> saddishwasher: sadtoaster amazing nicks. keep it up.
[19:49:08] <nimbu> o dear.
[19:49:13] <sadtoaster> yeah
[19:49:21] <luite> ajpiano: adding float: left removes the line break, but the vertical alignment is still off. I'll play with it a bit more to get it right :)
[19:49:22] <sadtoaster> nimbu, dont forget sadmicrowave
[19:49:31] <nimbu> so i was recently made aware of!
[19:49:36] <nimbu> who is going to be the sadkitchen?!
[19:52:28] <danieliser> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/VpFHY/
[20:08:31] <danieliser> djQuery: any idea
[20:30:41] <dualcore> how does a jquery programmer break up with his girlfriend???     $(this).fadeOut();
[20:34:51] <dualcore> hi Davey
[20:51:20] <lastk> hey guys, is possible to know the position of the $(this) on a list? I adding a event for the $('.activities'), but I need to know the position when clicked
[20:51:36] <sontek> is there a foreach/forloop in jquery.tmpl?  I have the json {'foo': tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3], 'bar': tags: [foo, bar, baz]}
[20:51:43] <sontek> and so I want to loop through the tags and list them out
[20:55:23] <saddishwasher> hi all
[20:55:35] <sontek> found it, {each}
[21:52:53] <djQuery> anyone familar with knockout.js getting an error when trying to use a child template.http://jsbin.com/evuxav/6/edit
[21:53:08] <djQuery>  <tbody data-bind="template: {name: 'coltmpl', foreach: Columns }"></tbody>
[22:17:35] <djQuery> sontek: a child template usualy works so much better than a {{foreach}}
[22:22:26] * djQuery kinda dead tonight
[22:23:17] <wookiehangover> djQuery: sup
[22:23:31] <djQuery> yo
[22:23:44] <wookiehangover> this may be up your alley https://github.com/wookiehangover/jquery-tmpl-jst
[22:23:46] <djQuery> having an issue with knockout.js
[22:23:56] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/evuxav/6/edit
[22:24:03] <djQuery> dang child template getting me
[22:25:13] <Fretta> I am making a multi step wizard and would like to have the option to pre populate some fields, would serialize be the trick?
[22:25:30] <djQuery> wookiehangover: xpt I am not familar with cake being a .net kinda guy
[22:25:56] <wookiehangover> djQuery: soon enough you'll have some js runtimes
[22:26:01] <wookiehangover> ;)
[22:26:08] <wookiehangover> knockout looks interesting
[22:26:19] <wookiehangover> i'm mostly been doing backbone stuff of late
[22:26:25] <djQuery> its pretty cool if I can get it to work
[22:26:45] <djQuery> supposedly the tmpl engine is plugable so you could use backbone instead of tmpl
[22:27:23] <djQuery> wookiehangover: backbone support 2 way binding?
[22:28:35] <wookiehangover> no
[22:29:03] <wookiehangover> but the paradigms it enforces with views make things tightly couples
[22:29:11] <wookiehangover> coupled
[22:34:24] <solidus-river> 'night all, happy jquerying :)
[22:55:58] <inZania> Hey all. Some of the users of my Chrome browser extension are having trouble with an ajax request (it works fine for me and most). The error handler is being triggered but I can't figure out why. They can load the page fine in a browser. The 3 parameters given to the error handler are not helpful. Here's a scrrenshot of their log; the 3 paramaters given to the error handler can be seen in 3 lines after "Facebook session errored out"
[22:56:00] <inZania> http://s3.amazonaws.com/satisfaction-production/s3_images/542328/__.png
[22:56:48] <inZania> I also have handlers set up for 500/404/etc. errors, none being triggered
[23:07:45] <luite> is it possible to make a qtip2 tooltip follow the element it belongs to, if that element is moved (it's part of a modal dialog)?
[23:11:07] <gf3> ?g qtip2
[23:11:08] <bot-t> gf3, qTip2 - Pretty powerful tooltips - http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/
[23:11:59] <luite> yeah that one :) I can't find it in the documentation
[23:12:23] <gf3> luite: check out this demo: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/demos/#viewport
[23:12:54] <luite> I could handle a move event for the dialog and then call reposition on all tooltips, but that seems more trouble than it's worth
[23:12:57] <luite> oh
[23:12:58] <luite> thanks
[23:13:01] <luite> hmm
[23:13:05] <luite> that does the same
[23:13:44] <luite> I don't have a list of tooltips, so that would get a bit messy
[23:16:25] <luite> hmm for some reason I had totally mist the demo's :)
[23:16:30] <elliotf> having a weird jquery ui autocompleter bug:  http://jsbin.com/enulud/2
[23:17:21] <elliotf> clicking into a textarea that has the autocomplete widget activated, then hitting escape will wipe out the contents of the textarea
[23:17:41] <elliotf> maybe friday night isn't the best time to ask for help.  :)
[23:18:06] <gf3> elliotf: odd, do you have a demo of the bug?
[23:18:16] <elliotf> gf3: link pasted above
[23:18:21] <elliotf> <elliotf> having a weird jquery ui autocompleter bug:  http://jsbin.com/enulud/2
[23:18:31] <gf3> elliotf: of the autocomplete bug
[23:18:39] <gf3> not the default behaviour
[23:18:39] <elliotf> ...
[23:18:43] <elliotf> ?
[23:19:01] <elliotf> gf3: the link above exhibits the bug..  I'm not sure what else you're asking.. ?
[23:19:57] <gf3> ahh sorry
[23:19:59] <gf3> my mistake
[23:20:18] <elliotf> http://jsbin.com/enulud/4
[23:20:33] <elliotf> has a direct comparison to autocomplete'ed and non-autocomplete'ed
[23:20:46] <elliotf> basically, how do I start figuring out what the problem is?
[23:21:11] <elliotf> I'll try adding a keyup event listener and returning false..
[23:21:37] <tp43_> Hi, I am trying to execute the following: $('div#somthing').css('background', "url('change-image.png')"; Can someone help me with the syntax please?
[23:22:29] <tp43_> nevermind, I missing the last bracket
[23:22:37] <elliotf> tp43_:   $('div#something').css({ 'background': ...
[23:22:39] <elliotf> awww...
[23:22:50] <gambleonian> i'm having some trouble loading the jquery ui properly
[23:22:57] <tp43_> elliotf, thx
[23:22:59] <elliotf> gambleonian: what's the problem?
[23:23:05] <elliotf> tp43_: np
[23:23:08] <gambleonian> i'm trying to use the slider function
[23:23:17] <gambleonian> and it seems to be rendering
[23:23:28] <gambleonian> as chrome recognises a slider with properties
[23:23:33] <gambleonian> yet it has a height of 0
[23:23:44] <gambleonian> so is invisible
[23:23:53] <elliotf> gambleonian: I'd try putting it up in a pastebin..
[23:24:00] <gambleonian> k
[23:24:03] <elliotf> gambleonian: so people can see the code and what you're trying to do
[23:24:10] <elliotf> but I'm a jquery ui newbie
[23:24:12] <elliotf> sort of
[23:24:43] <gambleonian> i'm only using 	$( "#slider" ).slider();
[23:24:58] <gambleonian> with a div id=slider
[23:25:03] <gambleonian> and this occurs
[23:25:13] <gf3> elliotf: looking through the jQ UI code
[23:25:25] <elliotf> gambleonian: are you loading jquery-ui's css, too?
[23:25:36] <elliotf> gambleonian: as in, how are you trying to load things?
[23:25:46] <gf3> elliotf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L112
[23:25:46] <gambleonian> ah ha
[23:25:49] <gambleonian> no i am not doing that
[23:25:58] <elliotf> gambleonian: :)
[23:26:10] <gf3> elliotf: self.term isn't set because a search hasn't been performed yet
[23:26:18] <elliotf> gf3: nice spot
[23:26:22] <gf3> elliotf: it should work if someone types something, then hits escape
[23:26:30] <gambleonian> can i do that through google CDN?
[23:26:32] <elliotf> gf3: yes, it does...
[23:26:49] <elliotf> gambleonian: I don't know..  what does the javascript library page say?
[23:26:54] <gf3> ?boom
[23:26:55] <bot-t> Did you are unimpressed? and now?
[23:27:09] <elliotf> gf3: that's a weird bug...
[23:27:21] <gf3> elliotf: yeah
[23:27:36] <elliotf> gf3: I guess it should check to see if there's a term?
[23:27:47] <elliotf> and wait a minute..
[23:27:53] <gf3> elliotf: do you need to provide a default value?
[23:28:02] <elliotf> gf3: how do you mean?
[23:28:14] * elliotf looks at the documentation
[23:28:32] <gf3> elliotf: the bug happens because the user doesn't type anything (other than escape)
[23:28:47] <elliotf> gf3: right...
[23:28:50] <gf3> therefore `self.term` is never set because a search is not performed
[23:28:55] <elliotf> gf3: shouldn't it do nothing, then, though?
[23:29:10] <elliotf> gf3: as in, shouldn't it check to see if self._term is defined before it uses it?
[23:29:14] <gambleonian> thanks a bunch btw!
[23:29:21] <gf3> well in the code, escape resets the input to whatever was previously typed
[23:29:34] <elliotf> gambleonian: np...  can you load the css via google?
[23:29:47] <gf3> elliotf: it's so people can cancel a search and go back to what they had before
[23:29:51] <gambleonian> doesn't seem so, i think it has to be local
[23:30:09] <elliotf> gf3: but it shouldn't automatically replace what they type..
[23:30:17] <elliotf> gf3: it drops down a selection box by default..
[23:30:21] <gf3> elliotf: in every case except for yours it should
[23:30:22] <elliotf> gf3: not touching the input field
[23:30:29] <elliotf> no..
[23:30:33] <elliotf> not just in my case..
[23:30:46] <elliotf> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/remote.html
[23:31:02] <elliotf> gf3: in the demo, it just shows the drop-down, it does not immediately replace.
[23:31:24] <gambleonian> you can do it!
[23:31:25] <elliotf> gf3: if you start typing something in that and hit escape, it has some odd behaviour, too.
[23:31:30] <gambleonian> nice move google
[23:31:30] <elliotf> gambleonian: yays!
[23:31:35] <elliotf> thank you, google!
[23:31:56] <elliotf> gf3: type wh, wait for the list to show, then type some more letters and hit escape..
[23:32:05] <elliotf> gf3: it wipes out the later letters you typed...
[23:32:15] <elliotf> that seems like erroneous behaviour to me.
[23:33:08] <elliotf> gf3: it seems like that escape code should only be triggered if the user has arrowed down into the list...
[23:33:22] <elliotf> hrm...
[23:33:32] <gf3> elliotf: yes, exactly
[23:33:46] <gf3> elliotf: and in the other case, it effectively does nothing
[23:33:46] <elliotf> gf3: but if they're not in the list, that shouldn't be triggered..
[23:33:57] <elliotf> okay, I think I can fix this.
[23:33:59] <gf3> elliotf: but in your case it's because the user hasn't typed anything
[23:34:07] <elliotf> gf3: no, not just in my case..
[23:34:26] <elliotf> gf3: like I said, it's whenever you hit escape before the response has arrived.
[23:35:01] <gf3> elliotf: that's the same bug
[23:35:15] <elliotf> yes
[23:35:17] <gf3> elliotf: it's not being set yet, because it's on a timeout
[23:35:18] <elliotf> gf3: I agree.
[23:35:34] <elliotf> right.
[23:35:36] <elliotf> true.
[23:35:40] <gf3> elliotf: this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L118
[23:36:04] <elliotf> gf3: are you a jquery developer or a user?
[23:36:25] <gf3> eh, I'm on the bug team
[23:36:25] <elliotf> it's sort of all wrong, though...
[23:36:32] <gf3> not for jQ UI though
[23:36:50] <elliotf> because it shouldn't replace the text with the search term..
[23:37:04] <elliotf> it should replace the text with whatever was in the text box before replacing...
[23:37:24] <gf3> elliotf: of course
[23:37:33] <elliotf> gf3: #jqueryui-dev is pretty dead atm.
[23:39:07] <elliotf> hrm..
[23:40:34] <elliotf> it's almost the code that replaces the input value should store the prior value..
[23:40:40] <gf3> elliotf: so to fix this, the first line of the escape code handler  if self.term === undefined, then self.term = self._value()
[23:41:04] <elliotf> I think using the term is wrong, though.
[23:41:22] <elliotf> I think it shouldn't do anything if it hasn't been replaced..
[23:41:24] <elliotf> right?
[23:41:59] <elliotf> rather than basing it on the term..
[23:42:10] <gf3> it's easier to check if nothing has been entered
[23:42:27] <gf3> so it effectively replaces itself with itself
[23:42:36] <elliotf> gf3:  but it's still not right.
[23:42:46] <elliotf> gf3: ah..  okay, I think I see what you're saying.
[23:43:24] <gf3> when hitting ESC, if a term hasn't been set at all, set the term to the current value
[23:43:32] <gf3>  continue with rest of function
[23:43:33] <elliotf> gf3: that sounds good..
[23:43:51] <elliotf> gf3: I'm not a super javascript guy..  is there any kind of easy way to monkey patch the fix in my example jsbin ?
[23:44:10] <elliotf> as in, replace the autocomplete _create function?
[23:44:19] <gf3> elliotf: you'd have to do it to the jQ UI source, unfortunately
[23:44:26] <elliotf> gf3: that's fine..
[23:44:31] * elliotf downloads jquery ui
[23:45:26] <elliotf> gf3: I don't see any issues/tags/whatever on that github page...
[23:45:47] <gf3> elliotf: the bug tracker is external
[23:45:56] <gf3> elliotf: I can make a pull-request
[23:46:19] * elliotf looks on jquery ui's page for ticket tracking
[23:46:36] <danheberden> bugs.jqueryui.com
[23:46:42] <elliotf> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/
[23:46:44] <elliotf> heh
[23:46:47] <elliotf> yay!  trac!
[23:47:21] <elliotf> tbh, I think I'm going to just steal that code..
[23:47:29] <elliotf> that's the only part of jquery ui that I'm using.
[23:47:56] <elliotf> gf3: danheberden made that point that jquery ui doesn't support jquery 1.6.2
[23:48:12] <danheberden> he's a smart cookie, that gf3
[23:48:29] <gf3> this bug is unrelated to jQ version
[23:48:30] <elliotf> danheberden: yes, yes he is.
[23:48:35] <elliotf> gf3: I agree
[23:48:35] <gf3> unless I have missed something
[23:48:45] <elliotf> gf3: no, the logic seems flawed
[23:49:01] <elliotf> gf3: when the demo is broken, then you know it's not the jquery version.  :)
[23:49:24] <elliotf> wait a minute...
[23:49:34] <elliotf> gf3: I don't think your suggested solution will work..
[23:49:43] <danheberden> given the amount of open bugs, i don't think its the only problem :p
[23:50:07] <elliotf> because in the case I described above (using the demo page) where you wait for the first menu to come bak..
[23:50:13] <elliotf> it wipes out later letters..
[23:50:22] <elliotf> so it's using an outdated term, I guess
[23:50:29] <elliotf> hrm.
[23:50:36] * elliotf looks for another autocompleter
[23:50:42] * elliotf does not want to write his own
[23:52:46] <elliotf> hrm, it looks like there's a bit of jquery ui stuff in there.
[23:52:49] <elliotf> not so easy to strip out
[23:53:36] <elliotf> danheberden: wait, 1.8.14 says it's for "jquery 1.3.2+" ?
[23:53:50] <elliotf> how does that not include 1.6.2 ?    :)
[23:54:27] <danheberden> elliotf that is a very good point
[23:54:44] <danheberden> namely, a bit lazy to upgrade the site - it's a bitch man, lemme tell ya
[23:54:47] <danheberden> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/demos/autocomplete/default.html
[23:54:50] <danheberden> does that show the same bug for you?
[23:55:42] <elliotf> danheberden: yes
[23:55:58] <elliotf> danheberden: http://jsbin.com/enulud/4
[23:56:01] <elliotf> is what I came up with
[23:56:10] <elliotf> danheberden: it doesn't actually do any autocompletion
[23:56:27] <gf3> elliotf: so, if you wait for the menu to appear, then select an item, hit escape, it should show what you originally typed
[23:56:55] <elliotf> gf3: yes, once the request has completed and you're arrowing down into the list, it works correctly
[23:57:41] <elliotf> danheberden: in the demo url you posted, click into the input, type "ja<ESC>"
[23:57:46] <elliotf> the ja will disappear
[23:57:56] <danheberden> right
[23:58:01] <elliotf> which is something I could see my users doing.
[23:58:09] <elliotf> "type type type (all done!)<ESC>"
[23:58:13] <danheberden> that's what i'd expect if i hit ESC
[23:58:18] <elliotf> ?
[23:58:25] <elliotf> that what you've typed goes away?
[23:58:33] <danheberden> hmmm
[23:58:40] <elliotf> I would disagree
[23:58:54] <danheberden> sry i misunderstood
[23:58:57] <danheberden> because on my machine
[23:59:02] <danheberden> "ja" stays
[23:59:05] <elliotf> hrm.
[23:59:06] <danheberden> and the autocomplete window closes
[23:59:09] <danheberden> which is what i'd expect
[23:59:14] <elliotf> danheberden: you're waiting too long.
[23:59:14] <danheberden> the text in the input is fine
[23:59:16] <elliotf> literally
[23:59:20] <elliotf> hit ja<ESC>
[23:59:34] <danheberden> ya, i did it as fast as i can
[23:59:39] <elliotf> danheberden: faster!
[23:59:40] <elliotf> :)
[23:59:44] <danheberden> twss
[23:59:48] <elliotf> danheberden: browser/OS?
[23:59:51] <elliotf> twss ?
[23:59:54] <danheberden> i mean, i got a lot of gin in me but i can still type pretty quick
[23:59:57] <danheberden> ?ud twss
[23:59:57] <elliotf> heh
