[00:00:09] <coldhead> right, fuck this, i'm going home
[00:00:14] <coldhead> good luck larsemil!
[00:00:22] <larsemil> coldhead: got it working thanks to your hints. thanks
[00:00:35] <coldhead> oh good, i will commute more contentedly now :)
[00:03:35] <larsemil> :)
[00:03:47] <dida> hi all, what made an HTML form different?
[00:04:07] <dash> Hi. Any QUnit users in the neighborhood? I'm trying to figure out how to handle serialization of async tests
[00:04:25] <dash> in particular, I've got results from one async test showing up in the report for another.
[00:04:40] <dida> lets say i have form1 = $("#first_form"), Is there a way to manipulate $("#first_form") so that
[00:05:31] <dida> for example $("#first_form").attr('id', 'second_form')
[00:05:54] <dida> and form2 = $("#second_form")
[00:06:08] <dida> so that form1 == form2 returns false?
[00:06:34] <dida> what made a form different?
[00:07:54] <Cork> dida: $ generates a new object each time so you can't compare like that
[00:07:54] <dida> it returns false, but my goal is to have form1[0] == form2[0] returns false
[00:08:59] <Cork> dida: they should, as i said, each instance of jquery selector will be a uniq object
[00:09:03] <dida> form1[0] returns HTMLElement right, how can I make it different?
[00:09:33] <Cork> dida: no it doen't return the dom object
[00:09:44] <Cork> dida: this should work though $("#first_form")[0] == $("#first_form")[0]
[00:10:00] <Cork> dom objects can be compared, jquery object can't
[00:10:14] <Cork> you can use .is in newer versions of jquery though
[00:11:04] <dida> Cork: what manipulation should be done to make it different?
[00:11:17] <Cork> dida: make what different?
[00:12:51] <__n1v3K> check this out > http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproappcompat/thread/efcd4783-e948-4f85-9659-7a6e9139a931/
[00:13:14] <dida> the real problem is I'm using validation plugin
[00:13:42] <dida> http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[00:14:26] <dida> on a multiple step in the same form
[00:15:43] <dida> nevermind, i'll put an example code and get back here again. thanks
[01:14:21] <larsemil> when using .load() i get the content TWICE. how can that be?
[01:15:43] <Cork> larsemil: do the browser register two connections?
[01:15:53] <larsemil> Cork: no.
[01:16:19] <Cork> check what the server sends so it doesn't contain duplicats
[01:16:28] <Cork> and if it doesn't pb your code
[01:16:54] <Cork> ?p @ larsemil
[01:16:55] <bot-t> larsemil, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:17:43] <subdesign> hey, how to check if an element has only one specific class?
[01:18:09] <larsemil> Cork: i tried putting <?php echo "test"; ?> only in my page that i load from. it came back testtest;
[01:18:34] <Pumi> Hello Everyone
[01:19:22] <megatrond> hi all
[01:19:46] <Cork> subdesign: check the class attrubute instead of hasClass
[01:19:57] <dash> hi. do people still use qunit and mockjax for unit testing, or is there a different preferred thing now?
[01:20:05] <megatrond> how can i pass the result of the .load() function into a variable, instead of into a div? do i need some kind of temporary placeholder?
[01:20:10] <subdesign> oh i see
[01:20:12] <Cork> larsemil: $(this).prop('class') == 'my-class-name
[01:20:12] <subdesign> trying
[01:20:16] <dash> because so far as I can tell, they're utterly shite
[01:20:20] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[01:20:24] <Cork> subdesign: ^
[01:20:38] <dash> at least for the purpose of testing ajax-calling code
[01:20:45] <Cork> larsemil: i need to see your code then, cause its something there
[01:20:58] <subdesign> working thx Cork ; )
[01:21:05] <Cork> np :)
[01:21:13] <subdesign> its too morning for me :P
[01:21:37] <Pumi> first of all, i didnt check if there is a room for jquery mobile.. my question is, can i use jquery for mobile phones, and detect multi-touch ?
[01:23:10] <Cork> Pumi: to start with this is the channel for mobile
[01:23:43] <dash> nobody here writes unit tests?
[01:23:44] <Pumi> so nice, im in right place ;)
[01:23:50] <Cork> Pumi: i think you need a plugin for it
[01:23:55] <Cork> but not sure
[01:23:56] <jayflux> hey all you jQuery heads, happy friday n all that
[01:24:09] <Cork> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/multiswipe
[01:24:22] <larsemil> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/N6xms/
[01:24:43] <jayflux> my icons here ajax in an article using .load. http://goo.gl/qtcgS    my question is how can i put a spinner in
[01:24:49] <jayflux> so they don't just show up and you can actually see them loading
[01:25:14] <jayflux> you need to select accessories btw and click a product.
[01:25:24] <Cork> larsemil: does the console.log run twice?
[01:27:07] <Pumi> this seems like it only have events for swipe, i need to detect when finger touches, and stop touching the screen
[01:27:20] <Pumi> but i guess, i can get this plugin, check the code
[01:27:42] <Pumi> and modify it too, to make it do what i want
[01:28:34] <larsemil> Cork: no
[01:29:01] <Pumi> and another thing i noticed, it only works on mobile safari..
[01:31:20] <aaronmcadam> Pumi: you need touchstart/end
[01:31:32] <obsd123> can anybody help me figure out why $meInput.val(event.which != 8 ? String.fromCharCode(event.which) : ''); is returning uppercase letters?
[01:31:43] <aaronmcadam> Pumi: #jquerymobile
[01:31:48] <Cork> larsemil: no idea what can cause it then, never seen it
[01:31:49] <obsd123> I've verified via console.log that event.which() is returning the lowercase charCode
[01:33:15] <larsemil> Cork: i know. tearing my hair out here. try it yourself: choose categories on the right side
[01:33:18] <larsemil> Cork: http://newteknikdalen.destinator.se/804.php
[01:33:38] <Pumi> aaronmcadam: thanks ;) checking it now
[01:34:14] <larsemil> Cork: hmm the code seems like its not double when inspecting element
[01:35:35] <larsemil> Cork: i know the problem, had one ul more then i thought. haha
[01:35:38] <larsemil> Cork: easy problem. :D
[01:36:34] <Benn> Your label elements are fucked
[01:41:43] <JKarsrud> whoa, larsemil... you have nested your labels in some weird way
[01:44:17] <larsemil> well obviously thats not how it should be. :)
[01:45:45] <larsemil> happier now?
[01:47:41] <JKarsrud> almost
[01:48:05] <JKarsrud> Remove those pesky <br>'s and style them with display: block; instead is bettar
[01:49:25] <JKarsrud> :)
[01:58:28] <domcat> hi there. any ideas/plugin suggestions how to achieve the following: let's say I have 4 images - I need to animate them that the first one greys out, then becomes colored again and the next greys out, and so on in a loop. Any ideas?
[02:04:05] <iman> how can i get anything between two div element ?
[02:04:50] <iman> $('#nameValue').innerHTML; ?
[02:04:50] <Haraldson> $('selector-for-div-1').nextAll(':not(selector-for-div-2)') maybe?
[02:05:11] <Haraldson> nah, that won't stop it
[02:06:52] <iman> I really interested in to get a value between to div like <div id='test'> sth </div>
[02:07:22] <JKarsrud> $('#test').html() or $('#test').text()
[02:07:58] <kollapse> iman: You mean what is inside one div, not between two divs.
[02:08:36] <iman> kollapse, i mean what is inside a dive
[02:08:38] <iman> div *
[02:09:00] <Cork> then .html() is what you want as JKarsrud said
[02:09:40] <JKarsrud> yay me! I was right :)
[02:09:50] <iman> yes, html() is applied, thanks everyone
[02:11:54] <crab> you never know what you might find inside a dive
[02:15:12] <subdesign> why i get a firebug error: this.form.submit is not a function?
[02:15:36] <subdesign> i want to submit the from with a select change, at other site this is working..
[02:17:01] <JKarsrud> $(this.form).submit()
[02:17:29] <JKarsrud> oh wait, are you submitting inside a change handler?
[02:17:37] <JKarsrud> Then this is the select element, not the form itself
[02:20:58] <Cork> subdesign: form isn't a standard dom property i think
[02:21:16] <Cork> better to look for the elements form parent and submit that instead
[02:21:23] <Cork> $(this).closest('form').submit()
[02:21:24] <JKarsrud> I'd probably do something like this inside the handler $(this).parents('form').submit();
[02:21:30] <JKarsrud> or closest, yeah
[02:21:43] <subdesign> okay
[02:21:50] <Cork> parents does something completly different
[02:21:57] <Cork> and has the potential to fail
[02:22:14] <JKarsrud> Cork: indeed it has, so closest is a better solution
[02:22:21] <JKarsrud> :)
[02:22:42] <Cork> not really better, but its for different tasks :)
[02:23:05] <Cork> and finding the correct form to submit isn't one of them ;)
[02:23:54] <crab> why is parents bad in this context?
[02:24:19] <Aamir> ?source parents
[02:24:20] <bot-t> Line#5380 - "parents: function( elem ) { return jQuery.dir( elem, "parentNode" ); }" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#5380
[02:25:04] <Cork> crab: if you have nested forms, it will submit all of them
[02:25:29] <Cork> parens will give you a collection of all elements in the parent hirarky that match the selector
[02:25:33] <Aamir> nested forms is invalid html :/
[02:25:35] <JKarsrud> Cork: my point exactly. But who nests forms?
[02:25:36] <JKarsrud> :P
[02:25:51] <Cork> JKarsrud: .net does for example
[02:25:54] <JKarsrud> no
[02:26:03] <JKarsrud> it doesn't allow more than one form per page
[02:26:16] <Cork> they do, i've hacked generated output from them where i've had to deal with it
[02:26:40] <JKarsrud> I work with .net every single day, it throws errors if you nest forms
[02:26:42] <Cork> not sure if its the developer that messed up or not though, never had access to the source
[02:27:01] <JKarsrud> but it depends if you're talking asp.net webforms or mvc
[02:27:24] <JKarsrud> mvc doesn't do the whole form thing, so it could be that the developer eff'd it up in his views
[02:27:26] <Aamir> Cork:  they just wrap everything in a form (one form)
[02:27:31] <Aamir> i mean .net
[02:27:36] <crab> i've never worked with .net in my life, and i have no idea if it nests forms or not!
[02:27:52] <Cork> i didn't mean it does it by default
[02:27:59] <crab> (and i intend to remain in this blessed state of ignorance)
[02:28:19] <Cork> but as i said, i've has to proxy an output from a .net server through php and deal with dubble forms
[02:28:39] <Cork> so i know there exist servers that does it
[02:28:41] <JKarsrud> Aamir: exactly, webforms wraps everything in one huge form, and use validationgroups as some internal way of determining which form elements to submit :P
[02:29:05] <Cork> i've dealed with .net a bit, but try to stay as long away from it as posible
[02:29:06] <JKarsrud> Cork: sure, it might be possible, but it should throw an exception at runtime
[02:29:09] <JKarsrud> sucks anyway :P
[02:29:16] <JKarsrud> I hate webforms
[02:29:34] <JKarsrud> asp.net MVC I can like, because then it's all about C#, which is an awesome language
[02:29:35] <Aamir> that is one of the main reason i hate .net so much.
[02:29:44] <JKarsrud> and the .net framework is awesome
[02:29:51] <Cork> JKarsrud: this was a resell api provider
[02:29:52] <JKarsrud> powerful shit
[02:29:56] <subdesign> i guess my problem ints here, it fires the alert box, but no submit happening
[02:30:01] <subdesign> *isn't
[02:30:14] <subdesign> with submit button form submits
[02:30:29] <Cork> JKarsrud: and they broke the api about every time they had to do something, and complained that "ourpage failed" and when we looked it where there servers that failed
[02:30:38] <JKarsrud> mm
[02:30:42] <Cork> JKarsrud: so loads of errors wouldn't suprice me
[02:30:51] <Cork> they where incompitent
[02:31:03] <JKarsrud> hehe
[02:31:17] * Cork is sooo glad he doesn't have to deal with that site anymore
[02:42:37] <larsemil> jquery pagination, seems to be some different plugins. i need to paginate <ul>
[02:44:31] <larsemil> recommendations?
[02:54:51] <iman> sorry for unrelated question, I am designing a full ajax with jquery, i need some very fantasy free icon, i can't figured out in google, do you know a website to have some ?
[02:55:50] <Benn> you need a loader.gif?
[02:56:31] <iman> Benn, no, i need some icon like home, about us, fb, twitter
[03:18:15] <juria_roberts> how do I select elements by name when it can in the form elementname1,elementname2
[03:18:49] <juria_roberts> the integer can be different i just want to be able to select the element by the string part of its name
[03:20:01] <JKarsrud> juria_roberts: do you want to select all elements with "elementname"?
[03:20:39] <juria_roberts> JKarsrud: yeah but there will be only one element with that name
[03:22:09] <JKarsrud> elementname* then
[03:22:25] <JKarsrud> you have elemname1, elemname2, elemname3
[03:22:36] <JKarsrud> and you want to select all those elements, right?
[03:22:52] <crab> is this h1..h6, or are they made-up element names?
[03:23:01] <juria_roberts> no the name attribute
[03:24:00] <JKarsrud> juria_roberts: $('[name^="elemname"]');
[03:24:27] <JKarsrud> the ^= means it selects elements where the attribute value _begins_ with elemname
[03:25:00] <juria_roberts> JKarsrud: ok thanks :)
[03:31:54] <SoulRaven> hi
[03:32:15] <SoulRaven> how i posibile to check if the div from ui dialog is not empty?
[03:32:48] <SoulRaven> i want to execut some functions after the ui dialog is opened and the div for that dialog is populated with data
[03:33:03] <SoulRaven> how i find if that div is not empty?
[03:33:29] <aleray> hi,  why is $(this).clone() resetting the selected option of my select where $(this) is "<span><select><option>...</option></select></span>" ?
[03:34:29] <SoulRaven> i thing becuse clone only clones the DOM element, not the DOM and the selection
[03:34:34] <ravenzz> SoulRaven if ($('#foo:not(:empty)').length)
[03:34:40] <filename> helo
[03:34:50] <SoulRaven> ravenzz: i will try, thx
[03:35:21] <filename> i can't find input's with jquery using $('input').each(...) that i loading through .ajax() into html
[03:35:27] <filename> is this html-dependend?
[03:35:59] <filename> the question is: is not DOM updated when i load something using .ajax/.get into some div ?
[03:35:59] <ravenzz> when do you try to select them?
[03:36:06] <SoulRaven> filename: be aware that when you using ajax, the conection is async
[03:36:21] <filename> ravenzz: after i load content into div, the content is input checkboxes
[03:36:29] <filename> but jquery can't find it
[03:36:44] <filename> it only can find old input's that was here when i firstly load html
[03:36:56] <ravenzz> so you load the content and the you try to select them within the ajax success callback?
[03:37:09] <ravenzz> and then*
[03:37:10] <filename> no not within
[03:37:16] <filename> after i press button
[03:37:25] <filename> the button showed after content is loaded
[03:37:26] <SoulRaven> if you try to find the element using webinspector?
[03:37:30] <ravenzz> well so you should take a look at on()
[03:37:34] <ravenzz> ?on @ filename
[03:37:35] <bot-t> filename, The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[03:37:39] <filename> SoulRaven: yes there is my inputs
[03:37:56] <filename> bot-t this is not ajax or mayebe even jquery-related
[03:37:59] <ravenzz> or live/delegate if you are using old version
[03:38:18] <SoulRaven> i think is a async problem, i just have to manage something like this
[03:38:23] <ravenzz> ?bot @ filename
[03:38:23] <bot-t> filename, ?bot-t
[03:38:27] <ravenzz> mh
[03:38:39] <ravenzz> filename can you provide a live working demo?
[03:39:09] <SoulRaven> try to init the functions or what you want to do after the ajax is complect the query, meaby to call all the elements in the success method
[03:39:30] <keybo> why won't a div background color come out in print?
[03:40:03] <SoulRaven> keybo: try to set the print options to css, i think
[03:40:17] <filename> SoulRaven: the find methods i use is not within ajax complete method
[03:40:29] <filename> it is just function() that i called after user pressed submit
[03:40:30] <keybo> all the other css attributes are being printed fine, just not background color
[03:40:51] <SoulRaven> keybo: try !important
[03:41:03] <filename> but the real problem is that looks like DOM is not updated after .get/.load so the document did not contain my new content
[03:41:08] <filename> anyone faced something same?
[03:41:14] <ravenzz> filename on() live() or delegate() is what you need i guess
[03:41:23] <filename> ok i will check
[03:41:26] <filename> thx
[03:41:32] <JKarsrud> filename: DUDE, listen to what people are sayingf
[03:41:41] <keybo> still nothing sorry
[03:41:59] <SoulRaven> i manage to stay from async problem, by doing the call in succees method, and is work out of the box
[03:42:14] <filename> JKarsrud i reading all here and looks like noone can understand what i am asking
[03:42:21] <filename> the problem is not with jquery
[03:42:33] <JKarsrud> yes, it probably is, if you're loading content
[03:42:44] <JKarsrud> with an async function like get or load
[03:42:50] <filename> i just can't find the way to make jquery find new content that i uploaded into div
[03:43:29] <filename> JKarsrud: but the content is displayed in browser
[03:43:34] <filename> and in firebug too
[03:43:52] <SoulRaven> filename: yes, but is displayed after the ajax is completed
[03:43:58] <filename> yes
[03:43:59] <JKarsrud> yes, but it doesn't exist when the dom is parsed
[03:44:06] <filename> yes
[03:44:07] <SoulRaven> but the content find is done before the ajax is completed
[03:44:10] <JKarsrud> because it's async
[03:44:11] <filename> NO
[03:44:21] <JKarsrud> DUDE, PASTE SOME FUCKING CODE THEN!
[03:44:23] <JKarsrud> wtf
[03:44:27] <filename> ok w8
[03:44:34] <JKarsrud> thank you
[03:44:49] <JKarsrud> It's impossible to help when you don't paste code, because then we have to make assumptions
[03:44:57] <filename> $('#cckeywordsdiv').load('ajax.php?x=suggestkeywords&keyword='+keys);
[03:45:06] <SoulRaven> try console.log(data); inside success or complete method and then outside the ajax, to see what is happen
[03:45:10] <JKarsrud> which you say are wrong, but the problem says otherwise
[03:45:11] <filename> the cckeywordsdiv now contain right html with inputs
[03:45:23] <filename> then i do (through button, when i checked all that i need)
[03:45:24] <blackspotwiggins> filename, callbacks, do you use them?
[03:45:24] <filename> $('input').each(function() {
[03:45:31] <filename> and no matches
[03:45:31] <blackspotwiggins> ?ajax101 @ filename
[03:45:32] <bot-t> filename, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[03:45:56] <SoulRaven> $('input').each(function() { after the ajax is loaded, in callback method
[03:46:06] <filename> blackspotwiggins for what? i just need to load content, i do not need to manupulate content before pasting it in div
[03:46:12] <SoulRaven> success, complete
[03:46:19] <hyperjxz> can anyone tell why when i jquery-ui tabs that have php page with jquery ajax form only the first tab wroks fine even though the tbas have the same php page linked to them?
[03:46:32] <filename> ok i will try
[03:46:47] <blackspotwiggins> filename, listen
[03:47:00] <blackspotwiggins> that content DOESNT FUCKING EXIST
[03:47:16] <filename> yes i know, but after i $.load() it it EXIST
[03:47:21] <blackspotwiggins> if you choose to ignore what much much smarter people tell you
[03:47:22] <blackspotwiggins> gtfo
[03:47:26] <filename> and i checking for it AFTER the content is loaded
[03:48:09] <SoulRaven> when you have bussines with ajax, try to think out of the box, personaly i spend about 2 day to undestand way some contend is not working as i want, because of some ajax load
[03:48:10] <filename> these lines i posted in not from same functions first is from one button handler, second is from another button
[03:48:48] <filename> wow shit i found problem
[03:48:53] <filename> am stupid sorry
[03:48:57] <blackspotwiggins> yes you are
[03:48:58] <filename> i just erased my content
[03:49:05] <filename> thank you blackspotwiggins
[03:49:12] <ravenzz> filename "Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements."
[03:49:14] <ravenzz> that's all
[03:49:49] <filename> well typical coders mistake
[03:49:51] <filename> that's all
[03:50:25] <hyperjxz> anyone?
[03:51:23] <SoulRaven> now my question, how i find if the div for a ui dialog is not empty when i use "dialogopen"?
[03:51:37] <ravenzz> I didn't understand what you mean hyperjxz
[03:52:29] <keybo> whats the hexadecimal for 'grey' css colour?
[03:52:57] <SoulRaven> 333333
[03:52:57] <hyperjxz> sorry.. I have jquery-ui tabs that have the same jquery and ajax forms in them but only the first executes
[03:53:01] <SoulRaven> 111111
[03:53:09] <iman> are there any way in jQuery to monitor a element like input which when a element's value changed ?
[03:53:09] <keybo> was that for me soul?
[03:53:17] <SoulRaven> keybo: yes
[03:53:17] <poppiez> is there any way to handle touches properly? e.g. when I bind "click" to an element I want a singletap to trigger the click event too
[03:53:20] <keybo> thanks :)
[03:53:35] <SoulRaven> all the simetric rgb are grey
[03:53:56] <ravenzz> SoulRaven i told you $('div:not(:empty)')
[03:54:03] <keybo> by the way, going back to the printing background question, chrome has no facility to print backgrounds
[03:54:06] <SoulRaven> is not working
[03:54:49] <SoulRaven> ravenzz: the div that i want to check is div that is populated when the dialog is open
[03:54:59] <SoulRaven> and is populated by ajax :))
[03:55:06] <ravenzz> you need to replace div with the reference to the current dialog
[03:55:17] <Glumb> keybo: http://gucky.uni-muenster.de/cgi-bin/rgbtab-en shades of gray at bottom
[03:55:47] <keybo> cheers :)
[03:56:05] <ravenzz> so you should check for it after on the ajax callback
[03:56:25] <SoulRaven> ravenzz, i know :((
[03:56:41] <SoulRaven> i hate that
[04:03:26] <mikunos> hi guys, I'am trying to create a multi-columns menu with jquery and the simple html. I have some difficulties to add a new group of items under the HOSTING PLANS item. I'd like to add another column inside the sub-menu but I don't understand where have I to add it. this is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/jydsn/2/
[04:09:48] <xec> keybo: "gray" color keyword is #808080 in hex
[04:10:14] <keybo> thanks xec
[04:12:42] <mikunos> any help?
[04:14:09] <iman> how to slowly hidden an element some time after fired ?
[04:14:29] <creator> hello i need guidence  to develope a web page using jquery and ajax
[04:15:35] <Guest65468> iman: shlowly hide an element after what is fired?
[04:16:00] <Cork> *slowly
[04:16:18] <iman> Guest16578, after it was fire
[04:16:33] <Cork> iman: you mean a click event or what?
[04:16:42] <Cork> "it" doesn't say what your doing
[04:17:28] <iman> Cork, it point at element, an element fired and after sometime would to fade
[04:17:51] <Cork> i have no idea what you mean with the element is fired
[04:18:45] <iman> Cork, you click in a button afterward a div will appear,
[04:19:14] <iman> I want to hide this div after sometime
[04:19:29] <Cork> ok so your doing a fadeIn?
[04:19:37] <Cork> or slideDown or something?
[04:20:32] <iman> like this   $('#saveMsg').fadeIn(1000);
[04:20:44] <Cork> ok now we'r talking
[04:20:55] <Pumi> iman use setTimeout(function(){  $('#saveMsg').fadeOut(1000); }, 1000);
[04:21:06] <Pumi> to hide it
[04:21:13] <Pumi> after x miliseconds
[04:21:35] <iman> Pumi, it works correctly , thank you
[04:21:42] <iman> Cork, thank you
[04:22:21] <Cork> iman: try something like $('#saveMsg').fadeIn(1000, function() { $(this).delay(1000).fadeOut(1000); });
[04:22:49] <Pumi> yup that should work too
[04:23:06] <Cork> and wouldn't need an extra dom selector :)
[04:23:23] <Pumi> but dont know why i had problems with delay
[04:23:31] <Pumi> and thats why i had to use timeout
[04:23:37] <Cork> delay more or less only works for effects
[04:23:53] <Cork> you can't use it as if it what setTimeout
[04:24:01] <Cork> *it was
[04:24:26] <Cork> all it does is add a few loops in the setInterval loop
[04:24:35] <Cork> until the next queued event happen
[04:25:11] <Cork> (all jquery effect drives by one setInterval loop)
[04:25:58] <Pumi> so other functions like append, appendTo etc. wont work with delay ?
[04:26:22] <Cork> nope
[04:26:28] <Cork> they don't use queue
[04:26:30] <Cork> ?.queue
[04:26:31] <bot-t> .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[04:27:09] <Cork> you could tecnically put your action in a function and push that one on the queue
[04:27:20] <Cork> and then it would be affected by the delay
[04:27:57] <Cork> but i normally just use setTimeout my self
[04:28:12] <Pumi> yeah got it
[04:28:14] <Pumi> ;)
[04:29:09] <Pumi> but again i think when you have to execute just one line, its better ( and shorter code ) to use .queue
[04:29:24] <Pumi> then setTimeout
[04:29:31] <Cork> not really
[04:29:34] <creator> HOW TO SEND my selected value form  the drop down list to my struts2  action class's method?
[04:30:12] <Pumi> Cork: like this example $(".message").appendTo('body').delay(2000).queue(function() { $(this).remove(); });
[04:31:05] <Cork> Pumi: i'm actually not sure if $(this) works in the queue
[04:31:14] <Cork> i think you might have to store the variable
[04:31:27] <Pumi> let me try it
[04:34:37] <Pumi> yep works
[04:34:37] <Pumi> http://jsfiddle.net/79Gqq/
[04:34:46] <Cork> good to know
[04:34:56] <Cork> then ya it has some real advantages!
[04:35:12] <Pumi> yeah i didnt even know about .queue until now
[04:35:20] <Pumi> so something new learned ;)
[04:35:27] <Cork> its what all over .effect is built around
[04:35:36] <Cork> *all of
[04:36:30] <poppiez> I've defined a mouseenter event for a div. for some reason, when clicking the div it opens on the ipad/iphone?
[04:36:49] <poppiez> s/clicking/tapping
[04:37:02] <gov_imp> does try{ } catch{ } work in a jquery script?
[04:37:13] <Cork> poppiez: ya touch devices move the "mouse" when you click
[04:37:24] <Cork> gov_imp: its part of javascript, so yes it does
[04:37:27] <poppiez> gov_imp: yeah of course
[04:37:40] <gov_imp> thanks!
[04:37:47] <poppiez> Cork: hmm, right ok. any slick way to deal with this?
[04:38:46] <Cork> check if the touchstart event exist?
[04:38:54] <Cork> and if it does don't bind mouseenter?
[04:40:20] <poppiez> Cork: alright. thx! :)
[04:41:08] <Pumi> Cork: is touchstart a jquery or jquery mobile event ?
[04:41:21] <poppiez> Pumi: both
[04:41:26] <Cork> its a dom event that exists on mobile devices
[04:41:33] <Pumi> oh ok
[04:41:36] <Cork> it has nothing to do with jquery
[04:42:04] <Pumi> can in track only one finger, or its multitouch ?
[04:42:27] <Cork> this is what i meant if ('ontouchstart' in document.documentElement) {}
[04:43:14] <Cork> Pumi: the touch event is documented here https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/TouchEvent
[04:47:06] <Pumi> this is nice
[04:47:23] <gov_imp> I've got this script that replaces text but fails if the text isn't available. Do I need a try/catch?
[04:47:24] <Pumi> i guess this works on most smartphones
[04:47:36] <aaronmcadam> gov_imp: nope
[04:47:47] <aaronmcadam> gov_imp: selectors fail silently so nothing will happen
[04:48:12] <aaronmcadam> I've never had to use try/catch
[04:48:41] <gov_imp> do while then?
[04:48:47] <aaronmcadam> huh?
[04:49:08] <aaronmcadam> just the line which replaces the text is fine
[04:49:43] <aaronmcadam> gov_imp: jsfiddle what you're trying to do
[04:49:43] <gov_imp> I'll show you what I mean
[04:50:00] <Cork> gov_imp: you might need to try catch if you work on an undefined variable
[04:50:13] <gov_imp> I've got this "$('.ms-listviewtable #titl1-4_ td.ms-gb').html($('.ms-listviewtable #titl1-4_ td.ms-gb').html().replace(/:&nbsp;3/g, '' ));"
[04:50:37] <aaronmcadam> you don't need that class selector qualifier
[04:50:59] <Paveloosha> Hi guys, is it possible to get BytesLoaded in #jQuery  like flash AS?
[04:50:59] <gov_imp> oh yeah?
[04:51:10] <Cork> id's are always uniq
[04:51:16] <aaronmcadam> and id is unique, what's the point in qualifying it
[04:51:20] <Cork> or rather has to be
[04:51:32] <gov_imp> alright, I've learned something
[04:51:50] <aaronmcadam> this explains it: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Writing_Efficient_CSS
[04:52:03] <aaronmcadam> selectors are parsed Right to Left
[04:52:13] <aaronmcadam> so you're making it go back up the dom for no reason
[04:52:29] <lumio> hello... is it possible to have a mouseup-event raised, even the mouse is outside of the object?
[04:52:32] <aaronmcadam> but jsfiddle a small example of what you're trying to do gov_imp
[04:52:44] <aaronmcadam> lumio you could use trigger()
[04:52:57] <aaronmcadam> ?trigger @ lumio
[04:52:57] <bot-t> lumio, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[04:53:09] <Cork> lumio: not on that object, its normally solved by binding a one time event on the window object
[04:53:48] <Cork> $(this).mousedown(function() { $(window).one('mouseup', function() {}); });
[04:53:50] <gov_imp> so this is sufficient "$('#titl1-3_').html($('#titl1-3_').html().replace(/:&nbsp;2/g, '' ));"
[04:54:39] <aaronmcadam> yea
[04:54:45] <lumio> thx Cork
[04:54:51] <lumio> und also aaronmcadam
[04:55:05] <aaronmcadam> wilkommen :P
[04:55:33] <lumio> lol
[04:55:40] <lumio> sry

[04:55:57] <lumio> war in gedanken gerade bei einem anderen gesprÃ¤ch :D
[04:56:12] <aaronmcadam> ?translate war in gedanken gerade bei einem anderen gespräch
[04:56:12] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Translation (German -> English) - was just a thoughtless gesprch other
[04:56:21] <lumio> xD
[04:56:23] <lumio> wtf?
[04:56:24] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[04:56:33] <aaronmcadam> a thoughtless expression?
[04:56:35] <Pumi> wow lol this bot can do so many things ? :P
[04:56:58] <lumio> ... no I just was thinking of another conversation
[04:57:14] <lumio> and that conversation is in german :D

[05:02:58] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[05:03:05] <sorahn> hey guys, i'm trying to build a multi-tier tab based menu with jquery, but i'm having some trouble with a generic function that will toggle all current level and lower tabs off when clicked, but not affect higher level tabs.  http://sorahn.net/tabs.html
[05:07:32] <sorahn> here's a jsfiddle link if that's easier.  It wasn't saving before so i just hosted it myself
[05:07:35] <sorahn> http://jsfiddle.net/sorahn/xHyPA/
[05:09:41] <xec> sorahn: i dont know how to fix your problem, but i award you 10 points for the use of the color "bisque" in a demo
[05:10:40] <sorahn> WOO 10 Points!
[05:11:37] <sorahn> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/  scroll down
[05:13:00] <xec> yeah, some hilarious color names for sure! i mean... "peachpuff"?
[05:14:48] <sethetter> sorahn: what are you trying to accomplish in the code?
[05:14:51] <xec> and "lightgoldenrodyellow" what?
[05:15:52] <aaronmcadam> i think to get the parent tab to highlight sethetter
[05:16:11] <jubby> cornflowerblue??? WTF is a cornflower xD
[05:16:19] <sethetter> ah i see, k i'm messing wth it..
[05:16:28] <sorahn> sethetter: it's a touch based menu, but it's spanning multiple roles which may or may not have all the options.  So at the top, you click the menu tab, and it opens the menu, then you have 6 more icons to click.
[05:17:14] <sorahn> but it can only have one active tab per 'tier'  and if you hide the whole menu from the top tab, it would hide everything.
[05:19:51] <xec> sorahn: i'm confused... what do you want to happen, and what happens now instead?
[05:19:56] <sahbeewah> is there a best practice for inserting elements into the dom?
[05:20:13] <sahbeewah> createElement?
[05:20:47] <sahbeewah> and append()
[05:20:50] <xec> createElement only creates, does not insert iirc maybe see ?insertAfter
[05:20:51] <bot-t> .insertAfter(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[05:21:01] <sethetter> sahbeewah: $('<p attr="value">Some Content</p>').appendTo('body');
[05:21:36] <sorahn> xec, if you click the 1st tab in the fiddle, it opens tier 2, and if you click any tab in tier 2, i want it to open the corresponding content in tier3.
[05:21:47] <xec> sahbeewah: you can also create elements in jquery like sethetter did, like: $("<div>")
[05:22:16] <sahbeewah> how would that compare to el = createElement("p"); $(el).attr(...)...
[05:22:29] <sahbeewah> performance-wise and whatnot
[05:23:19] <sorahn> xec, and then obviously closeing anything on the first tier would close everything.
[05:24:04] <xec> sahbeewah: i wouldnt worry about the performance unless you've found this to be a bottleneck, most likely negligeable difference
[05:24:18] <sethetter> sahbeewah: I may be wrong, but I believe using $('<html yadda="yadda"></html>') is faster because you're not storing a var first. But it will be a trivial difference
[05:25:13] <sorahn> ah here we go.  xec this: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/style/csslibrary/item/jquery_drop_line_tabs/ but with clicks instead of hovers
[05:25:51] <sorahn> my only problem is that the child elements aren't (in the code i have anyway) nested inside the parents
[05:26:04] <sahbeewah> wouldn't, jquery have to internally call createElement anyway and store a variable
[05:26:14] <sahbeewah> or am i missing something
[05:26:37] <sethetter> sahbeewah: no you're right i believe.
[05:26:48] <sorahn> maybe i can re-write the content...
[05:27:10] <sethetter> sorahn: it might work easier. i think your traversal code is where the errors are at
[05:27:24] <sethetter> sorahn: but i haven't fixed anything yet :P
[05:27:40] <sahbeewah> o k...
[05:27:43] <sahbeewah> brb
[05:28:38] <sorahn> sethetter: that's what I figured it was.  I'm not going to make every thing in lists, but maybe i'll re-structure the tiers to lve inside one another...
[05:29:50] <sorahn> the only problem with that is all the next levels in those things are all absolute position, which i don't really want.  I need the menu to push the content down.  *le sigh*
[05:29:56] <juria_roberts> how to call an onclick function of a button from jquery?
[05:30:52] <ravenzz> ?click @ juria_roberts
[05:31:18] <sorahn> oh, sethetter i know why that didn't work.  Becasue the content isn't always a static height...  some of the contents of the tiers can be like, a login form, or an icon bar, or some sorts, or whatever
[05:31:24] <juria_roberts> ravenzz: no not click i want it to trigger when form is submitted
[05:31:41] <xec> ?submit @ juria_roberts
[05:31:52] <xec> where is bot-t when you need him
[05:31:52] <sethetter> sorahn: hmm
[05:31:56] <Pumi> and bot suddently stoped working ?
[05:31:58] <Pumi> :P
[05:31:59] <Pumi> lol
[05:32:01] <ravenzz> submit but you should use an input element (type="submit")
[05:32:04] <ravenzz> instead of a button
[05:32:46] <sorahn> you can use button type='submit'
[05:32:52] <sorahn> as long as it's in the form it'll submit it.
[05:32:52] <juria_roberts> xec: i dunno how to explain i hav many tabs which are opened by buttons each button has an onclick function on submit i want each of those onclicks to be triggered
[05:33:27] <sorahn> also it's friday.  Fucking lazy bots.
[05:33:47] <xec> juria_roberts: did you make those onclicks? onclick="" attribute is frowned upon ;)
[05:34:00] <juria_roberts> xec: yes i did ;(
[05:34:15] <juria_roberts> xec: i thot it wudn't hurt
[05:34:27] <xec> juria_roberts: ok, if you use .click() event handlers instead it's easier to work with
[05:34:36] <sethetter> sorahn: I think I see a problem here. You have 3 levels of tiers and you only store a reference to this_tier and next_tier, so when you have the third tier toggled and you change tabs in the first, the third is unnaffected
[05:34:52] <sethetter> sorahn: you did want the third tier to hide when the first tier tab is changed, right?
[05:34:57] <xec> juria_roberts: you can do .click(function(){ etc... }) to create one and just .click() to execute/trigger it
[05:35:02] <juria_roberts> xec: i cant refactor the code now
[05:35:16] <sorahn> sethetter: yes
[05:35:42] <sorahn> also, when i click a tab on the 2nd tier it removes the active state from the one above it, but i know where that problem is
[05:36:21] <sorahn> oh, i think i need this_tier and next_tier (specifically to chagne it's active id) and sibling_tiers (plural)
[05:36:47] <keybo> if i have 4 li's display:inline, how do i space them evenly within the ul?
[05:37:13] <sethetter> sorahn: maybe try keeping track of tier levels with a number in the class name, and make all tiers higher than target tier inactive
[05:37:50] <keybo> anyone?
[05:37:55] <keybo> margin auto isnt working
[05:38:32] <sorahn> sethetter: that might work.  it's also 5:30 am right now, so i need to re-think this once i get to work.
[05:38:35] <sorahn> :P
[05:39:13] <sethetter> keybo: maybe try inline-block?
[05:39:21] <sethetter> sorahn: haha yeah
[05:39:38] <sethetter> sorahn: i actually only got up to feed my daughter real quick so i'm going to get back to bed :P
[05:40:05] <keybo> inline-block with margin auto isnt working either >.<
[05:40:15] <sethetter> sorahn: hope i've at least been of some help. gotta take off now, take care
[05:40:25] <xec> keybo: do you need it to work in <ie8 ?
[05:43:12] <keybo> xec: just firefox
[05:43:29] <xec> keybo: then you could use display: table-cell;
[05:44:27] <keybo> still not working >.<
[05:46:53] <xec> keybo: http://jsfiddle.net/caZ85/
[05:47:18] <xec> the color keyword is essential for this to work
[05:49:03] <keybo> xec: thank you :()
[05:49:05] <keybo> :)* lol
[05:50:06] <Daghdha> why do you sometimes have to use [0] when you look for something? In this case an id. I don't get it when i need to use [0] and not. :/
[05:50:45] <xec> [0] will just return the first DOM element in the collection (and not a jquery object)
[05:51:10] <abonec> hello
[05:51:17] <xec> hi there abonec
[05:51:24] <Daghdha> i know [0] is an array indexer, i mean. sometimes my selector lets me just access the found 'thing' directly and sometimes i need to use the indexer.
[05:51:36] <Daghdha> But i don't understand why this happens.
[05:51:43] <abonec> how can i change context within jQuery ready function to original "this"?
[05:52:05] <xec> Daghdha: so... when do you use [0]?
[05:53:00] <xec> Daghdha: $("#myID")[0].id will return "myID" but so will $("#myID").attr("id")
[05:53:23] <xec> assuming there is an element with that ID of course ;)
[05:53:54] <JKarsrud> [0].id is faster tho, no need to access the id attribute with .attr('id');
[05:54:20] <Daghdha> ok that's what i mean basically. Why doesn't the .attr need a [0] ?
[05:54:58] <SoulRaven> i undestand that .live() is deprecated in 1.7
[05:55:17] <CIDIC> i can't remember is this a relyable way to check if the jquery object has elements in it? if($('#thing').length){}
[05:55:21] <SoulRaven> is any replace for live that suport added element now in in the future?
[05:55:30] <xec> Daghdha: $("#myID") returns a jQuery object (which has access to jQuery methods such as attr) while $('#myID')[0] returns a native DOM object
[05:55:33] <gov_imp_> concatenation question. what's the correct syntax? var i=0; from this $('#titl1-1_') to this? $(#titl1-'+i+'_')
[05:55:37] <Jon471> SoulRaven .on
[05:56:22] <SoulRaven> yes, but .on do not suport the feature "in the future"
[05:56:36] <xec> SoulRaven: yes i believe it does
[05:56:37] <Jon471> .live was just a wrapper for $(document).delegate , now you need to delegate it yourself
[05:57:22] <xec> gov_imp_: you're missing a '
[05:58:03] <Daghdha> So when using a non unique selector (assuming is elect 100 images) the .attr("src","newimage.gif") will change all of them?
[05:58:05] <xec> no thank you, no nothing
[05:58:24] <xec> Daghdha: yes
[05:58:33] <Daghdha> i see
[05:58:52] <xec> Daghdha: but you cant do $("img")[0].attr( ..whatever )
[05:59:04] <Daghdha> no i'd use a common classname
[05:59:19] <xec> Daghdha: because [] doesnt return jquery, you don't have .attr as a method
[05:59:26] <xec> [0]*
[05:59:31] <Daghdha> yes i would do .src then yes yes i think i get it :P
[05:59:31] <CIDIC> no one can answer my simple question?
[06:00:12] <xec> CIDIC: try .length > 0
[06:00:17] <kborchers> CIDIC: yes, that is how you do that
[06:00:36] <gov_imp> sorry I got disconnected
[06:00:46] <CIDIC> isn't 0 falsy though?
[06:01:00] <kborchers> CIDIC: yes
[06:01:19] <xec> ah, yes, thats true
[06:01:26] <xec> i mean false
[06:01:31] <xec> xD
[06:01:36] <CIDIC> and length can't be negative so shouldn't it work if you just do if($foo.length) {} ?
[06:01:43] <CIDIC> can you think of any reason not to do that?
[06:02:05] <gov_imp> Can I concatenate a variable in a id reference? $('#titl1-1_') --> $('#titl1-'+i+'_')??
[06:02:16] <Jon471> CIDIC i can't think of any except that it reads better
[06:02:23] <xec> gov_imp: afaik, yes
[06:02:35] <xec> gov_imp: assuming i is 1
[06:04:58] * Daghdha dances with joy as he finally gets all his json data on the server :P
[06:09:40] <lumio> is there a function to get a tag name? like... $('<span class="foo">').tagName();
[06:11:06] <xec> lumio: $('<span class="foo">')[0].tagName; :D
[06:11:18] <lumio> thanks xec :D
[06:11:28] <savolai> close 'nuff!
[06:13:42] <xec> lumio: you can also do $('<span class="foo">').prop("tagName");
[06:13:53] <SoulRaven> sems that on use delegate
[06:13:57] <SoulRaven> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:14:18] <SoulRaven> http://jsfiddle.net/fkYxE/
[06:14:38] <SoulRaven> but for me is not working, is not even trigered the .on
[06:15:04] <xec> lumio: and some browsers return capital letters, so: $('<span class="foo">').prop("tagName").toLowerCase();
[06:16:37] <troubleman> What's the best way of getting product names and prices like http://www.fabricly.com/categories/tops? What I got so far: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/wUJwt/1/
[06:17:44] <xec> SoulRaven: what are you trying to do, exactly?
[06:17:51] <lumio> xec: yes :) thanks :) I just missed the $( before and ) after my variable so it only showed me <span class="foo"> -.-
[06:18:09] <SoulRaven> to prevent in a text box to type letters
[06:18:59] <SoulRaven> but this is in a ui dialog, so i have to make some live capture events
[06:19:15] <SoulRaven> i use live, and i working, but i want to change to .on()
[06:20:58] <Jon471> soulraven, this fiddle isn't functional because it's missing the rest of the code, but I *think* you want something like..
[06:20:58] <Jon471> $(elementToDelegateEventTo).on('keydown', _class_or_id, function(e){
[06:21:19] <Jon471> in that example "elementToDelegateEventTo" is an element in the document that will always exist, or perhaps just the document itself
[06:21:40] <xec> SoulRaven: http://jsfiddle.net/fkYxE/1/ ?
[06:21:50] <Jon471> also i should say, it should be a parent element of the elements matched by the _class_or_id selector
[06:22:05] <xec> SoulRaven: i just use setTimeout to simulate async event
[06:22:42] <SoulRaven> xec: tx, i will investigate the example
[06:23:53] <mathi> hi
[06:23:59] <xec> OH HAI!
[06:24:22] <mathi> what is the best way to return several HTML snippets in one single AJAX call ? in which format ?
[06:26:23] <xec> mathi: hmmm.. i foresee at least one problem with dumping them into a json array, the HTML most likely contains quotes? if you can escape/encode...
[06:26:36] <kborchers> mathi: why not just html?
[06:26:54] <xec> why html at all
[06:28:35] <troubleman> I'm trying to get product names and prices like http://www.fabricly.com/categories/tops? Here's what I got: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/wUJwt/3/ - what I gotta do next?
[06:29:24] <mathi> kborchers, because I have several components to update on my page. I could do several ajax calls but I thought would be better if possible to have just one server request. Why HTML at all and not just data ? Because I thought it would be easier that the server generates the HTML, and client just need to replace the component with the new HTML. The views are very complicated to generate (nested tables, a lot of logic, etc.) so if the
[06:29:24] <mathi> client should handle that, my JS wil be a mess
[06:29:31] <mathi> xec, ^
[06:30:09] <Daghdha> <- n00b here would use a string array
[06:31:02] <xec> Daghdha: yea thats basically what i suggested
[06:31:27] <gov_imp> hey xec, that worked for me but I have a new question
[06:31:28] <mathi> yes, will it be possible to escape/encode ??
[06:32:11] <mathi> xec, does it sound strange what I want to do ? Maybe I'm doing something wrong ?
[06:32:25] <kborchers> mathi: in that case i would probably still just send data back as json and then use something like handlebars.js to template it
[06:32:32] <danzik17> mathi: you may want to look itno templating
[06:32:49] <danzik17> kborchers: damnit, done stole my line :(
[06:32:55] <kborchers> ;)
[06:32:56] <gov_imp> this works differently I think -  .replace(/:&nbsp;0/g, ' ' ) --> .replace(/:&nbsp;'+i+'/g, ' ' ) any thoughts?
[06:34:22] <xec> gov_imp: i'm not 100% sure what you're trying to do, could you rephrase?
[06:34:42] <gov_imp> sure
[06:35:23] <xec> mathi: keeping http requests down to a minimum sounds like a good idea, and sending html isnt very bad either (imo)
[06:36:20] <gov_imp> in the .replace() part of the script I was trying to concatenate the variable for i in the place of zero in this example --> /:&nbsp;0/g
[06:36:43] <xec> mathi: but if you want to send "multiple snippets" you could for instance just wrap it in more html so you can get the parts you want from the result
[06:37:23] <mathi> xec, how would I get the parts from that wrapper ?
[06:37:49] <xec> mathi: same way you would search through the DOM really
[06:38:11] <mathi> xec, I think that's indeed the best solution! I would I have several <div id="partX">, were you thinking this way ??
[06:38:45] <xec> mathi: you could do something like $(ajaxResultData).find(".someclass") for instance
[06:38:57] <xec> mathi: or ID's, yes
[06:39:24] <mathi> ID's are more performand but anyway, I got the idea, nice thx I'll give it a try that way :)
[06:41:10] <codabrink> Hi, please excuse my newness to javascript, I'm trying to create a simple plugin, but chrome keeps giving me an unexpected end of input error.
[06:41:12] <codabrink> https://gist.github.com/1376624
[06:41:20] <codabrink> There's the gist, do you have any suggestions?
[06:42:13] <codabrink> Okay, so it's a different error.. apparently the semicolon isn't supposed to be there.. But once that's gone, then the other error comes back.
[06:42:35] <codabrink> semicolon isn't supposed to be there on line 23*
[06:42:54] <xec> codabrink: jslint says: Problem at line 23 character 10: Expected ')' to match '(' from line 3 and instead saw ';'.
[06:43:51] <kborchers> codabrink: you need a ) between } and ; on 23 and then you need another }; between 23 and 24 i believe
[06:44:13] <codabrink> Ohh, okay
[06:44:52] <gov_imp> this is what I am trying to do https://gist.github.com/1376636
[06:44:56] <codabrink> That fixed it :) Thank you
[06:45:39] <codabrink> Also, thank you for introducing me to jslint, that looks very useful
[06:47:32] <xec> codabrink: indeed, also check out jsfiddle.net - it has a very nice TidyUp and highlight pairs of brackets
[06:50:35] <xec> gov_imp: thats just more (nearly) unreadable code, what is it supposed to do? :)
[06:54:45] <gov_imp> sorry about not being clear

[06:58:18] <keybo> anyone know why firefox wont print out the styles associated with an iframe, just the text content?
[06:59:17] <phlp> keybo: is the style a background?
[06:59:56] <lumio> is there a built in function/event that raises, when the mouse is over an element but in real the mouse is over another element, what I drag over another object
[07:08:02] <chuzzy> do you guys think it would be faster for me to target an empty <td> at the end with :last or to insert a new one?
[07:08:38] <Rembane> chuzzy: Measure it.
[07:08:42] <Rembane> chuzzy: Why is speed important?
[07:09:02] <chuzzy> speed is always important
[07:09:16] <chuzzy> what's the best way to mesaure?
[07:10:39] <fission6> cans omeone recommend me a nice modal plugin thats light weight and easy to control the contents of
[07:11:11] <Rembane> chuzzy: http://getfirebug.com/logging under timing and profiling
[07:12:11] <uchuff> fission6: if you mean like a lightbox type thing i like colorbox
[07:12:31] <fission6> cool i will review uchuff i will be displaying html inside of it which is updated through ajz
[07:12:33] <fission6> ajaz
[07:12:36] <fission6> ajax
[07:13:35] <phlp> chuzzy: http://jsperf.com/selectappend
[07:14:00] <fission6> crap colorbox looks good - the one issue is that the modal needs to be positionable, like i need to float ir left
[07:14:24] <ryanneufeld> colorbox also needs a better api
[07:14:39] <phlp> i get exactly the same speed
[07:15:53] <fission6> does anyone know of a modal box which i can control where it shows itsself on screen "easily" i need to float supplmental content in a box on the right
[07:16:16] <ryanneufeld> fission6: it's all css

[07:16:33] <grandpapadot> Hey guys ... I'm trying to stagger a fadeOut() ... I've tried everything from .delay() to caching the objects in an array and setTimeOut() ... All I want is .each() row in a table to fade out *independently* a few hundred ms after the last ... any suggestions?
[07:16:40] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ Farkie
[07:16:42] <phlp> atleast on firefox.. append is way faster on chrome

[07:18:22] <grandpapadot> No code really, since none of it works for what I'm after, lol -> $("#id table tr").each(function($(this).delay(500).fadeOut()))   etc ...
[07:18:27] <adoven> anyone got any thoughts on input mask plugins? e.g. i give it a regex and it ensures that the user input conforms to it
[07:18:35] <grandpapadot> All the rows still just fade at once ...
[07:18:35] <ryanneufeld> ?pe @ grandpapadot
[07:18:37] <bot-t> grandpapadot, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[07:19:05] <Farkie> ryanneufeld: works in jsfiddle.net but not on my page
[07:19:34] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: then something on your page is interfering?  Are there errors in the console?
[07:19:40] <Farkie> no errors in console
[07:19:44] <ryanneufeld> adoven: there is an input mask function
[07:19:53] <ryanneufeld> *input mask plugin
[07:20:27] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: can you show me your code?
[07:20:33] <grandpapadot> http://jsfiddle.net/ReNz9/
[07:20:40] <Farkie> the jsfiddle or real link?
[07:20:46] <ryanneufeld> real if you have it
[07:20:53] <ryanneufeld> if it's working on JS Fiddle
[07:20:58] <Farkie> http://bit.ly/uLmVbX
[07:21:17] <grandpapadot> http://jsfiddle.net/ReNz9 -> all I'm after is a staggered fadeOut() where one row fades, then the next, etc.  Seems so easy, lol, but they all just fade at once
[07:21:24] <caseyd> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxGmzuEhJMk <- Does anyone know of a library that does something like this?

[07:22:53] <ryanneufeld> ?
[07:23:01] <Farkie> my point
[07:23:12] <ryanneufeld> http://agra.ichameleon.com/behaviour/.js/
[07:23:16] <ryanneufeld> is that right?
[07:23:19] <Farkie> no
[07:23:50] <ryanneufeld> is that the file your code should be in?
[07:24:05] <Farkie> nope, it's a few lines below
[07:24:12] <ryanneufeld> grandpapadot: see ?demo
[07:24:13] <bot-t> grandpapadot, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[07:24:43] <grandpapadot> Figured it out ...
[07:24:48] <grandpapadot> Thanks, though
[07:24:53] <Farkie> ryanneufeld: I just changed somethings around and it's worked :D
[07:24:57] <ryanneufeld> grandpapadot: how did you solve it?
[07:25:06] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: you should be using a doc ready for that

[07:26:04] <grandpapadot> ryanneufeld: mine?
[07:26:07] <ryanneufeld> grandpapadot: that's not a great way to solve that problem either
[07:26:07] <Farkie> because of the non-ready?
[07:26:12] <grandpapadot> ryanneufeld: lol
[07:26:15] <grandpapadot> ryanneufeld: suggestions?
[07:26:24] <phlp> grandpapadot: http://jsfiddle.net/ReNz9/2
[07:26:25] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: you're kind missing the point of using jquery
[07:26:46] <nicorio> hi, just discovering the changes in 1.7, I was wondering : in the .on(events [, selector] [, data], handler) function, what's the use of the selector parameter ? Isn't it enough to use the selector in the jQuery object ?
[07:26:49] <grandpapadot> ryanneufeld: ahh .. interesting .. tnx, going to study that a bit ;)
[07:26:52] <ryanneufeld> grandpapadot: what phlp shows is exactly what I was gonna do
[07:27:05] <Eviltwin> grandpapadot: http://jsfiddle.net/DCeYB/
[07:27:08] <grandpapadot> phlp: ahh .. interesting .. tnx, going to study that a bit ;)
[07:27:34] <grandpapadot> Thanks guys! Learned something new :) :) :)
[07:28:05] <Farkie> how so, ryanneufeld
[07:28:07] <onil> getting  permission denied in IE while using jquery-1.6.2.min.js  error at following position {b.src?f.ajax({url:b.src,async:!1,dataType:"script"}):f.globalEval((b.text||b.textConte .... plz help
[07:28:46] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: I don't even know where to begin honestly
[07:28:50] <Eviltwin> onil: We're going to need more context than that
[07:29:07] <grandpapadot> awesome.
[07:29:09] <Eviltwin> onil: What did you do to cause that error?
[07:29:12] <grandpapadot> >bmfg<
[07:29:35] <ryanneufeld> grandpapadot: ?
[07:29:44] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/SWHhy/
[07:30:15] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: by binding to the clicks that way, you don't need to have a unique class on every div class="nologin"  just have the
[07:30:31] <ryanneufeld> class="nologin" instead of "nologin1/2/3"
[07:30:36] <ryanneufeld> follow?
[07:30:43] <Farkie> yep didn't know about the .next
[07:30:45] <onil> Eviltwin: i am using omniture script
[07:31:37] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: so instead of using onclick, and using jquery instead, you've decoupled you're JS from your HTML, AND it will work in more browsers as not all IE supports onclick on spans (I think)
[07:31:37] <Farkie> hm ryanneufeld: still no slide
[07:32:25] <ryanneufeld> is it live?
[07:32:29] <Farkie> yep
[07:33:04] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: okay, causse next is the wrong thing here.
[07:33:26] <ryanneufeld> your markup is just formatted oddly :P
[07:33:33] <ryanneufeld> sec lemme get a demo for you
[07:34:24] <Farkie> thanks ryanneufeld :)
[07:34:58] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: see, you have more than one instance of your login form
[07:35:04] <ryanneufeld> which is kinda silly
[07:35:07] <ryanneufeld> but that aside
[07:35:09] <ryanneufeld> we can make this work
[07:35:20] <Farkie> Yeah, that's what the client wanted :(
[07:35:32] <Farkie> under each resource
[07:37:53] <gov_imp> is it possible to check in a if statement whether or not an id is available on a page?
[07:38:00] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/SWHhy/1/
[07:38:04] <Eviltwin> gov_imp: $("#id").length
[07:38:14] <ryanneufeld> gov_imp: yup ^^^
[07:38:14] <Eviltwin> Truthy if the ID exists, falsy if not
[07:38:36] <ryanneufeld> gov_imp: length *should* be one or zero
[07:38:44] <ryanneufeld> since ids are supposed to be unique
[07:38:49] <Farkie> ryanneufeld: That worked well, thanks :)
[07:38:50] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: Length will be one or zero
[07:38:59] <Eviltwin> ryanneufeld: Since it uses document.getElementById
[07:39:04] <Eviltwin> Which can return at most one element
[07:39:21] <Farkie> ryanneufeld: why did you put spans in a var?
[07:39:30] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: it's called caching
[07:39:38] <ryanneufeld> if you need those spans again later
[07:39:44] <ryanneufeld> you can just use spans instead of the selector
[07:39:54] <gov_imp> cool thx
[07:39:55] <Farkie> ah :) just reading through, i'd rather learn than just use :)
[07:40:03] <ryanneufeld> it's faster because it doesn't have to re-scan the DOM to find those elements
[07:40:12] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: that's good
[07:40:51] <Farkie> so does parents() basically go up a level?
[07:41:02] <ryanneufeld> ?parents() @ Farkie
[07:41:02] <Eviltwin> Farkie: No
[07:41:03] <bot-t> Farkie, .parents([selector]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/parents/
[07:41:24] <ryanneufeld> wb ben_alman
[07:41:33] <Farkie> so the filter would be the .next funct?
[07:41:47] <ryanneufeld> no
[07:41:47] <ben_alman> o thx
[07:41:55] <Farkie> sorry, i'm useless
[07:41:58] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: open the docs, have a read
[07:42:03] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: you're not useless
[07:42:33] <ryanneufeld> Farkie: you want to learn this stuff, it's all in the docs. Read em, try stuff, and come back and ask questiosn
[07:42:40] <ryanneufeld> I'm sure there is a flaw in my solution
[07:42:51] <ryanneufeld> someone will probably find it lol
[07:51:39] <pootpoot> anyone here work with masonry?
[07:51:39] <nicorio> does anyone know the use of the [selector] parameter in the .on() function ?
[07:53:08] <grandpapadot> Does anyone know if replaceWith() will clear all bindings to the removed objects?

[07:53:41] <pootpoot> when i masonrize my #content div, some of my absolutely positioned elements are thrown off when they move to the OFFSET of a div inside the masonized #content
[07:54:12] <nicorio> phlp: but why wouldn't we select the right element in the $() function ?

[07:54:47] <DarsVaeda> hi, how do I open an url in a new window/tab?
[07:55:01] <phlp> nicorio: because you attach the event to what you have in $() and it applies to events that bubble up from [selector]
[07:55:22] <DarsVaeda> I tried $(location).attr(target, _blank) $(location).attr(href, url)
[07:55:24] <pootpoot> DarsVaeda: target attribute in the anchor tag
[07:56:01] <DarsVaeda> but now that I see it I think it was quite stupid
[07:56:39] <nicorio> phlp: thanks for the answer. Now, i think I should learn more about event bubbling... I'll go read the article pixelhandler talked about
[07:57:22] <Dave_Stein> in 1.7 is .hover shortcutting to .on or .bind?
[07:58:04] <pts\3> i want to submit a form on blur (example, select item from dropbox, and when user clicks somewhere else, their selection is submitted to the server). for some reason the submit is permanently looping :/ how can i make it stop after one submission?
[08:03:21] <nicorio> Dave_Stein: according to the jQuery documentation, .hover() hasn't changed since v1.0
[08:10:14] <slite> Hi. I use a $.ajax xhr call to a parent domain to login with a user. The domain i connect to set a cookie, and that works if i use connect with "withCredentials", but when i use <img src='url'> the cookie data is not sent. Any clues what i do wrong?
[08:19:44] <Dave_Stein> nicorio: i dont know if they update that bit if its underlying changes the user wouldnt notice, i guess i can look at source
[08:22:32] <phlp> Dave_Stein: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/47d66eaebd6d4a2ee3e037445bfac65d82fc6780/src/event.js#L1043
[08:23:04] <phlp> it has since been changed to .on though
[08:23:36] <nicorio> to anyone who (like me) wouldn't be enough informed about event delegation, here is a good article http://www.ultimatewebtips.com/why-jquery-live-is-a-bad-option-to-use/
[08:36:11] <sl00> Hi. I am working on a new widget and everything worked fine until I created another instance. I have two private variables _main_container and _last_args. But somehow _last_args seemsto be shared between all instances. Why is that? What have I missed?
[08:42:31] <Eviltwin> sl00: You're making a widget?
[08:42:41] <Eviltwin> Are you using $.widget?
[08:42:49] <sl00> Eviltwin: Yes.
[08:43:02] <Eviltwin> Can you post it somewhere for us to see?
[08:43:34] <sl00> Eviltwin: The issue is discuessed here and over a year old. http://forum.jquery.com/topic/inheritance-with-widget-and-options-of-type-array
[08:44:33] <Eviltwin> Oh, you're trying to extend a widget?
[08:44:59] <sl00> Eviltwin: No. Not except Widget I guess?
[08:45:23] <Eviltwin> This issue is marked as answered and resolved
[08:45:52] <Eviltwin> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5830
[08:46:04] <Eviltwin> So that's not it
[08:46:33] <Eviltwin> Unless you're using jQuery UI 1.8.2
[08:46:39] <sl00> I just created a new private variable.. this._id = this.element[0].id; ..it is working as I expected. But if I do.. this._id = [this.element[0].id]; then if I output all instances _id all show the last ones.
[08:46:53] <Eviltwin> Can we actually see youre code?
[08:47:00] <Eviltwin> Instead of just the select snippets you think are relevant?
[08:49:49] <Dave_Stein> phlp: thanks
[09:01:18] <mangOskittle> Hello all
[09:01:19] <hdon_> hey guys, does anyone know a trick to work around the problem with doing slideDown() when a container element is display:none?
[09:01:33] <hdon_> it seems that the height calculation is inevitably 0px when a container element is display:none
[09:02:53] <sl00> Eviltwin: I am trying to figure out this jsfiddle page :)
[09:02:54] <Jon47> hdon_ you can find the actual eventual height by removing "display:none", calculating the height, then quickly setting display back to none
[09:03:04] <Jon47> it won't flicker or anything
[09:03:21] <hdon_> lol, "quickly" yeah i suppose that works, though the reflow overhead seems like it might be annoying... *thinks*
[09:03:36] <hdon_> well
[09:03:41] <ravenzz> ..
[09:03:43] <hdon_> hmm
[09:03:59] <hdon_> yeah i guess it's only reflow overhead is only increased by a factor of 2
[09:04:04] <hdon_> i'll do that
[09:04:05] <hdon_> Jon47: thanks
[09:04:07] <ravenzz> if the element is display:none it will slide down
[09:04:21] <hdon_> or actually.. what am i thinking? why do i need to animate if it's display:none? i'll just add it
[09:04:24] <uchuff> to listen live or not, I'm only half way thru 41 atm
[09:04:28] <slite> if im on sub.example.com and does a xhr-call to example.com, it seem that the cookie set by example.com get set on sub.example.com. Any way to make the cookie set to example.com?
[09:04:28] <kollapse> Hmm. Can I do .filter("[attr1!='val1'][attr2!='val2']") ?
[09:04:28] * hdon_ shakes his head

[10:08:24] <Farkie> lots of wayw
[10:08:26] <Farkie> ways
[10:09:43] <oojacoboo> where to single quote and where to double quote, this is the question
[10:09:54] <Eviltwin> What context?
[10:10:41] <sl00> Hm.. I have found out why some values are shared between instances but I still do not understand why. If I define a "private" variable in my widget "body" _array: [] and then later in the _create I just push values then the array is shared. But if I do this._array = new Array; inside _create and then push values then it is not shared. Why the differens?
[10:10:46] <oojacoboo> well, I'm currently dealing with a ton of code where nearly everything is double quotes :/
[10:11:41] <Eviltwin> sl00: Arrays aren't copied automatically
[10:11:42] <oojacoboo> I'd think single quotes would be what to use most of the time unless you need quotes within quotes, right?
[10:12:16] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: I believe in JavaScript single quotes and double quotes are entirely intechangeable
[10:12:19] <sl00> Eviltwin: What do you mean exactly?
[10:12:40] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: not when you're grouping
[10:12:43] <Eviltwin> sl00: var a = [1]; var b = a; b.push(2);
[10:12:48] <oojacoboo> for instance...
[10:12:49] <Eviltwin> sl00: Now a is [1,2]
[10:12:50] <oojacoboo> 	$("#live-feed").delegate('button[type="submit"]','click',function(e){
[10:13:08] <oojacoboo> note that you need single around the css in that case
[10:13:17] <blez> how can I .fadeIn() on already visible elements?
[10:13:45] <sl00> Eviltwin: Ah I see!
[10:13:45] <blez> or slideDown
[10:13:45] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: You mean 'button[type="submit"]' doesn't work?
[10:13:53] <oojacoboo> it does
[10:13:59] <oojacoboo> I'm saying that's the correct usage
[10:14:08] <oojacoboo> you couldn't use double quotes there
[10:14:13] <Flam> $('.hackBox').click(function(){  //stuff });   Does the click automagically do each?
[10:14:26] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: "button[type='submit']" should work
[10:14:32] <Eviltwin> And so should "button[type=submit]"
[10:14:41] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: yes, it would
[10:14:52] <Eviltwin> And 'button[type="submit"]' should be === "button[type=\"submit\"]"
[10:15:02] <Eviltwin> Flam: Yes
[10:15:03] <oojacoboo> although, I don't understand the logic there, I thought single quotes were intended to be translated as literal
[10:15:15] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: In some languages, yes
[10:15:20] <Eviltwin> I don't believe so in JavaScript
[10:15:45] <oojacoboo> ugh
[10:16:07] <oojacoboo> anyway, thanks
[10:16:17] <Eviltwin> Yeah, ''s and ""s are identical in JS
[10:16:21] <blez> somebody?
[10:16:36] <Eviltwin> blez: What are you trying to accomplish?
[10:22:16] <jita> I have a multiple select field. But it only holds a single value if i display its value using onChange="alert(this.multiple);
[10:22:24] <jita> alter(this.value) *
[10:22:41] <jita> the value displayed is always the first one
[10:23:32] <Eviltwin> jita: $(this).find("option:selected").map(function(){return $(this).val()})
[10:24:50] <jaequery> lets say i have methods:  site.get.text();  site.get.image();   site.get.something();    ....   now i have a var type = 'text';    i want to pass the type so it can run    site.get.text()  ,  when i do like ,   site.get.{type]();   ..... anyone know how i can do so?
[10:25:21] <Eviltwin> jita: site.get[type]();
[10:26:24] <jaequery> thx

[10:30:45] <derdon> hi. how do I check or uncheck a checkbox I selected with jQuery?
[10:30:54] <Eviltwin> derdon: .val(true) or .val(false)
[10:30:55] <Eviltwin> I believe
[10:31:06] <derdon> Eviltwin: no, unfortunately not
[10:31:18] <derdon> Eviltwin: this sets the value="" attribute of the tag
[10:31:23] <derdon> which is not what I want
[10:32:27] <derdon> I could do it without jQuery, but then I can't select the checkbox that fancy ;)
[10:32:41] <Eviltwin> .attr("checked","") vs .attr("checked","checked")
[10:33:13] <derdon> Eviltwin: ah, right! thx
[10:34:33] <derdon> Eviltwin: although only the XHTML version works, i.e. <checked="checked"> instead of simply <checked>
[10:34:44] <iPaintCode> FireQuery awesome for debugging!!!

[10:41:25] <thomedy_com> iits still growing down
[10:46:41] <Guest4612> hey guys, i want to create a 'token' effect on a comma seperated list
[10:46:59] <Guest4612> and have the ability to delete whole tokens at a time etc.
[10:47:02] <Guest4612> whats the best plugin for this
[10:47:18] <thomedy_com> im not sure if im the best to answer this but you could try split('delimeter', offset)
[10:48:03] <Guest4612> well sure, split works, programmatically. I'm talking about the whole token ui piece as well
[10:49:17] <Eviltwin> thomedy_com: Perhaps add a background that moves too?
[10:49:18] <Guest4612> this does alot of what I want http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/
[10:49:24] <Guest4612> actually, it probably does more than what I need
[10:50:47] <Guest4612> i want it so someone can type and when they type a comma, that triggers the end of that token, and you begin creating the next. However, now from a remote source or anything.
[10:51:00] <Guest4612> just that text, not based off some auto complete or suggest matching
[10:53:07] <thomedy_com> crap of course i didnt even think of that.
[10:53:10] <thomedy_com> your amazing
[10:53:56] <thomedy_com> that will work
[10:54:22] <thomedy_com> and i could move it at a slower rate
[10:54:24] <thomedy_com> to create depth
[10:54:32] <thomedy_com> and blur it
[10:54:34] <thomedy_com> in gimp
[10:55:07] <Eviltwin> Yup
[10:55:25] <thomedy_com> not only taht i could do away with the in a pinch branch and really create a better imagery
[10:55:30] <thomedy_com> you are a agenius
[10:55:36] <thomedy_com> Eviltwin++
[10:55:40] <thomedy_com> or an evil ++
[10:55:54] <Eviltwin> Oldest trick in the book :P
[10:56:21] <Eviltwin> This is also a really fun trick: http://css-tricks.com/1820-blurry-background-effect/
[10:56:24] <Eviltwin> Not exactly related
[10:56:34] <Eviltwin> You might be able to take advantage of it
[10:57:37] <Eviltwin> Actually that one doesn't seem to be working quite right for me
[10:57:42] <jaequery> im trying to create an app which you can resize an image. i can already just do this using jquery ui's resizable. are there any particular reason i should go with canvas instead?
[10:57:42] <Eviltwin> Huh
[10:57:57] <thomedy_com> so i just found css3 transitions.. im eager to try those
[10:57:57] <Eviltwin> jaequery: For resizing an image?
[10:58:00] <thomedy_com> not for this project
[10:58:04] <thomedy_com>  but at least to see
[10:58:11] <thomedy_com> its not cross browser proof yet
[10:58:35] <jaequery> are you sure?
[10:58:55] <Eviltwin> jaequery: No need to use canvas just to resize an image
[10:59:12] <jaequery> ok
[11:00:09] <thomedy_com> neat but not really what i need right now...
[11:00:12] <thomedy_com> good tric
[11:00:13] <thomedy_com> thoughy
[11:00:19] <thomedy_com> its kinda cheating really

[11:21:34] <Eviltwin> What version of IE?
[11:22:13] <Chopps> 9
[11:22:37] <Woet> Chopps: you read wrong. jQuery supports IE6+, as mentioned on the homepage.
[11:23:19] <warrenparsons> It's the @ symbol IE doesn't like.
[11:23:24] <warrenparsons> :p
[11:23:37] <Woet> it's standards IE doesn't like.
[11:23:37] <Chopps> damn, then im doing something wrong lol, weird thing is ff and chrome work fine :S
[11:23:54] <Woet> Chopps: and the IE 9 debugger says?
[11:23:55] <warrenparsons> Woet: exactly
[11:26:07] <Chopps> havent took a look at the debugger, i was testing late at night and i was in a hurry, so i dint bothered to check it
[11:26:31] <MayorOfDetroit> I am Governor of Michigan, and more importantly, I am now mayor of Detroit. My name is Coleman A. Young (Carl Levin can a pussy.)
[11:26:55] <warrenparsons> Chopps: It could be a trailing comma in an object. IE tends to choke on those.
[11:27:15] <Woet> Chopps: F12
[11:28:18] <Woet> Chopps: you have time to ask on IRC,  so you definitely have time to debug it.
[11:28:49] <warrenparsons> JSLint will save your ass if you let it.
[11:28:58] <gkatsev> jshint ftw
[11:29:00] <Chopps> that was the other day, i didnt bothered to ask till today, im checking if i can replicate jquery not working on ie
[11:29:14] <MayorOfDetroit> So here's what I want to do: Attach events to divs with the class "crackhouse", and then at some later point when they get burned down (removed from the DOM via removeChild, or burnt down by some kid on Devil's Night), I want jquery to remove the binded events.
[11:29:45] <Eviltwin> MayorOfDetroit: .remove() unbinds listeners
[11:30:14] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: I use JSHint on Sublime Text and *hate* that I can't turn off warnings about mixed tabs/spaces.
[11:30:52] <MayorOfDetroit> Eviltwin: Which means any variables or instances of functions in those event callbacks get garbage collected?
[11:31:03] <Eviltwin> If that's the only instance, yes
[11:31:13] <Eviltwin> If you have references to them hanging around elsewhere then no
[11:31:25] <Chopps> Woet, it doesnt show anything on cosole, and it doesnt do what its supposed to do
[11:31:42] <Woet> Chopps: doesn't do what its supposed to do != an error
[11:31:46] <Woet> ?debug @ Chopps
[11:31:46] <bot-t> Chopps, Firebug: http://www.getfirebug.com/ or Firebug Lite (for non-firefox browsers): http://www.getfirebug.com/lite.html plus Debug: http://benalman.com/projects/javascript-debug-console-log/
[11:32:08] <Chopps> like i said works fine on ff and chrome, not in ie
[11:32:14] <Chopps> ie console doesnt says nothing
[11:32:17] <Eviltwin> Look at Firebug Lite
[11:32:23] <Eviltwin> Can be used in any browser
[11:32:28] <Eviltwin> Including IE
[11:32:31] <Chopps> ah nice, will do
[11:32:33] <gkatsev> warrenparsons: edit the code?
[11:32:40] <MayorOfDetroit> Eviltwin: Now I just need to add a reference to .remove() as .fn.BurnDownThisHouse() so it will work in my Detroit site.
[11:32:40] <Woet> Chopps: which is exactly what bot-t said.
[11:33:13] <Woet> temp01 snover ajpiano paul_irish
[11:33:22] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: You mean edit the source of the JSHint plugin? Probably possible, but I haven't gotten quite annoyed enough to go that far.
[11:33:27] <snover> Woet: what?
[11:33:43] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: Moreso annoyed that it's not a config option.
[11:33:43] <Woet> snover: MayorOfDetroit appears to be a troll.
[11:33:54] <PagliaccioDiGhia> ciao
[11:33:56] <PagliaccioDiGhia> !list
[11:34:13] <ajpiano> Woet: MayorOfDetroit is usually awesome
[11:34:15] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: And it's not an oversight. The developer of JSHint is pretty dogmatic about spaces/tabs.
[11:34:21] <Woet> then he should stay awesome :(
[11:34:31] <gkatsev> warrenparsons: ok. well, it's still better than jslint
[11:34:38] <snover> Woet: I think you are confusing humour with trolling
[11:34:42] <ajpiano> yep
[11:34:45] <Woet> possibly
[11:34:46] <ajpiano> was gonna say the same thing
[11:34:46] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: How so?
[11:34:59] <Woet> too many trolls might have made me oversensitive
[11:35:02] <Woet> i apogolize
[11:35:11] <gkatsev> less config options and more opinions
[11:35:38] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: Which are you referring to in that statement?
[11:35:46] <gkatsev> jslint
[11:36:23] <belevele> hi, im begginer. how do i get the content from .html() on succes?
[11:36:26] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: I dunno. I used JSLint with TextMate and it never got in my way. I like the always-on background linting of JSHint in Sublime Text, which is why I use it.
[11:36:57] <belevele> i mean with .ajax | type .post()
[11:37:04] <gkatsev> warrenparsons: well, I like semicolon-less and comma-first style. jslint definitely doesn't like that.
[11:37:17] <gkatsev> though, I don't use any of that nowdays
[11:37:28] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: Ahh. Yeah, your code would give me a rash :)
[11:37:33] <gkatsev> hehe
[11:37:40] <gkatsev> comma first is really nice, though
[11:37:49] <gkatsev> so much easier to making objects be consistant
[11:37:53] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: I get its usefulness. The style just grates on me.
[11:37:56] <gkatsev> and not forgetting commas or getting extra commas
[11:38:01] <macromancer> belevele: you're gonna have to be more specific. do you want to return the HTML response on a successful POST?
[11:38:13] <belevele> macromancer, yes.
[11:38:23] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: It's also difficult to get consistent across a team of more than two or three people.
[11:38:37] <gkatsev> warrenparsons: I started doing that after seeing node's NPM's code. It's very clean and pretty and much more lispy.
[11:38:42] <MayorOfDetroit> How does jquery know to remove binded events when I use .removeChild() and not .remove()?
[11:39:06] <gkatsev> warrenparsons: yeah, on a team, I'd definitely write like how we can all agree on. But my own code is without semicolons and comma first objects
[11:39:09] <macromancer> ?tell
[11:39:10] <bot-t> macromancer, Syntax: tell <nick> <message>
[11:39:15] <macromancer> ?tell belevele $.ajax
[11:39:16] <bot-t> macromancer, Okay.
[11:39:20] <macromancer> haha
[11:39:22] <macromancer> wait
[11:39:32] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: Comma-last is part of the reason I insist on team-wide linting.
[11:39:38] <macromancer> how do you get this bot to spit out a link?
[11:39:50] <belevele> macromancer, i found the answer here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ . tnx anyway xD
[11:39:51] <bot-t> (34 secs ago) <macromancer> tell belevele $.ajax
[11:39:58] <macromancer> lol
[11:40:09] <macromancer> ?ajax @ belevele
[11:40:11] <bot-t> belevele, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:40:16] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: And no semicolons is the great satan.
[11:40:16] <macromancer> belevele: that's what i was trying to do :)
[11:40:18] <datlap> how can i change the value of  readOnly based on the value of substring(2) $(this).raty({ readOnly:  false,click: function(score, evt) {var vote_url = this.attr('id').substring(2);
[11:40:23] <belevele> :)
[11:40:25] <macromancer> $.post is the same thing except it assumes type: 'post'
[11:40:48] <gkatsev> warrenparsons: well, to be able to write semicolon-less code you need to know js well. but it looks so clean
[11:41:01] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: Yeah, to me it looks ugly.
[11:41:34] <gkatsev> I came to js through scheme, so...
[11:41:42] <warrenparsons> gkatsev: And our team is made up of quite a few developers, not all of whom have JS as a primary specialty.
[11:50:15] <abadr> Animating a borderColor, it flashes to white before animating, which I'd like to avoid. I assume this is because it can't find the current style, which I assume is because it's looking for a generic borderColor instead of something more specific, like borderTopColor. Any suggestions?
[11:51:00] <jeek_> hi
[11:56:21] <devc> hey guys, I'm setting animate() properties to a variable of key: 'value' pairs then calling it like this: .animate({animation}, 800); but it's not working. Is that possible?
[11:57:14] <Eviltwin> var animation={left:"100px"};
[11:57:23] <Eviltwin> .animate(animation,800);
[11:57:24] <Eviltwin> Like that
[11:57:49] <devc> Eviltwin: Yeah. thanks -- I'd just removed them and came in to call false alarm but you beat me to it
[11:57:52] <acidjazz> hey guise
[11:58:01] <acidjazz> i like to store attribute data for jquery to pick up in htmls
[11:58:12] <acidjazz> like <div class="bob" eventid="5">
[11:58:17] <acidjazz> then i do like $(this).atrt('eventid')
[11:58:22] <devc> lol @ guise!
[11:58:24] <acidjazz> problem is w3 validator bitches
[11:58:27] <acidjazz> what do?
[11:58:32] <acidjazz> not care?
[11:58:58] <acidjazz> are there reserved unused words i can use
[11:59:16] <devc> acidjazz: could oyu use .data() instead?
[11:59:31] <devc> take it out of the HTML and into the JAvaScript?
[12:00:07] <Eviltwin> acidjazz: Techincally all non-standard properties should be prefixed with "data-"
[12:00:26] <Eviltwin> <div class="bob" data-eventid="5">
[12:00:33] <Eviltwin> Which you can access with .data("eventid")
[12:00:37] <belevele> i have a question about jquery and wordpress. i want to use a custom file to run my code for $.ajax and for that i have to in clude the wp_config.php into my file to be able to use $wpdb... but if i include it then i get duplicated content. cant get where's the problem.
[12:00:53] <acidjazz> Eviltwin: oooOooo
[12:00:58] <acidjazz> devc: what is .data() ?
[12:01:14] <acidjazz> oh no shit
[12:01:18] <acidjazz> i never knew about this
[12:01:22] <devc> acidjazz: the same thing Eviltwin is talking about, I think?
[12:01:28] <acidjazz> yea i read it all
[12:01:30] <acidjazz> thats awesome
[12:01:37] <devc> acidjazz: I learned about it a few weeks ago and have been using it extensively. It's effing awesome.
[12:02:32] <acidjazz> im excited to .data
[12:02:35] <TheJH> is there a setter equivalent to .position()?
[12:07:18] <TheJH> meh, I'll just use .css('top', y)
[12:09:20] <jeek_> belevele: is $.ajax just going to load a php script?
[12:11:33] <Eviltwin> TheJH: .offset is a setter but .position isn't
[12:11:34] <belevele> jeek_, i cant get what do you mean, sorry. i have a custom php file into my theme where i run the code. if i include the wp_config then it duplicates my content, else not. but i have to include it to be able to do sql queries.
[12:11:40] <Eviltwin> getter and setter
[12:12:56] <jeek_> belevele: wp_config should already be included, can you perform a SQL query without including wp_config? are you just trying to use $wpdb?
[12:13:37] <belevele> jeek_, yes, im trying to use $wpdb because i want to use the get_results() property.
[12:16:09] <jeek_> belevele: I believe this link may help you: http://garagetechblog.com/2009/09/20/wordpress-ajax-and-wpdb/
[12:17:48] <belevele> jeek_, thanks. gonna read it.
[12:17:58] <jeek_> belevele: awesome! hope it helps
[12:18:58] <albertosh> Hey guys, isn't the new .on function a substitute for .live?
[12:19:14] <albertosh> it's not quite working for me when    i change the source of an image...
[12:19:18] <Eviltwin> albertosh: .delegate is a better version of .live (which shouldn't be used any more)
[12:19:27] <Eviltwin> And .on is called by .delegate now
[12:19:31] <albertosh> and .on is for binding?
[12:19:32] <Eviltwin> As .on is the replacement for all event listeners
[12:19:50] <albertosh> so if i have an image with id lets say #mainImage
[12:20:03] <albertosh> and i create it after the .on binding
[12:20:08] <albertosh> shouldnt it trigger the action?
[12:20:36] <Eviltwin> No, so .live was a hack
[12:20:43] <Eviltwin> A kind of disgusting hack
[12:20:58] <khmer> .live had the unfortunate effect of feeling like magic to junior devs
[12:21:07] <albertosh> yeah i know
[12:21:09] <khmer> "derp why use .bind when .live is JUST like .bind and has more magic"
[12:21:16] <Eviltwin> $("foobar").live("click",function(){}) should now be done with $(document).on("click","foobar",function(){})
[12:21:39] <albertosh> ok, and you think it is a good idea to use the .on method?
[12:21:45] <albertosh> or you see it as the new live?
[12:21:54] <khmer> more like $('#some_parent_of_foobar').on('click','foobar',function(){});
[12:22:09] <Eviltwin> Simple answer: If you have access to .delegate or .on, NEVER use .live
[12:22:31] <albertosh> yes but my question is, if the element does not exist
[12:22:37] <albertosh> will .on work?
[12:22:42] <albertosh> after i create it?
[12:22:43] <Eviltwin> I had to explain this yesterday so I'll explain it again
[12:22:52] <albertosh> cause it's not working for me
[12:22:56] <Eviltwin> I start with a DOM
[12:23:01] <Eviltwin> That does not have an element with an ID foo
[12:23:09] <Eviltwin> And I do var foo=$("#foo");
[12:23:17] <Eviltwin> Then I add an element with ID foo to the dom
[12:23:22] <Eviltwin> And I act on that var foo
[12:23:27] <Eviltwin> What happens?
[12:23:35] <albertosh> nothing
[12:23:41] <albertosh> foo = undefined?
[12:23:45] <Eviltwin> Not exactly
[12:23:48] <Eviltwin> It's an empty collection
[12:23:53] <albertosh> exactly sorry
[12:23:56] <Eviltwin> But you're right that nothing happens
[12:24:08] <Eviltwin> Because $("#foo") creates a static collection
[12:24:11] <Eviltwin> $("...") always does
[12:24:44] <albertosh> and the .on creates an event listener for future objects created with that id?
[12:24:50] <Eviltwin> Nope
[12:24:57] <Eviltwin> $("...") should always be viewed as static
[12:25:02] <Eviltwin> However
[12:25:07] <Eviltwin> The second element can be a selector
[12:25:12] <Eviltwin> And that selector is dynamic
[12:25:19] <Eviltwin> It checks e.target each time
[12:25:25] <Eviltwin> To see if it matches the selector
[12:25:35] <albertosh> interesting
[12:25:35] <bartmax> jquery does native file upload support  ?
[12:25:39] <Eviltwin> So lets say we had $("table a")
[12:25:54] <Eviltwin> That would be every A tag in every table currently
[12:25:58] <someprimetime> what is the proper way for appending <script src='http://www.stumbleupon.com/hostedbadge.php?s=1'></script> to a div container?
[12:26:02] <Eviltwin> $("table a").bind("click",function(){})
[12:26:12] <Eviltwin> Would be every currently existing A in every currently existing table
[12:26:18] <Eviltwin> Nothing dynamic there
[12:26:18] <albertosh> yep
[12:26:27] <Eviltwin> However if we do $("table").bind("click","a",function(){})
[12:26:32] <Eviltwin> That binds to every currently existing table
[12:26:43] <Eviltwin> And only listens to clicks that originated by some A in the table (currently or in the future)
[12:26:53] <Eviltwin> So if you add new A tags, it works
[12:26:57] <albertosh> you mean .on or .bind?
[12:27:01] <Eviltwin> If you add new tables, it doesn't
[12:27:02] <warrenparsons> Eviltwin: Except .bind() doesn't do delegation.
[12:27:07] <Eviltwin> Yeah, by bad, old habits
[12:27:09] <Eviltwin> I meant .on
[12:27:20] <albertosh> ok, nice...
[12:27:29] <Eviltwin> What live does
[12:27:40] <albertosh> that was really helpful
[12:27:40] <Eviltwin> Is say you wanted the whole thing dynamic
[12:27:43] <Eviltwin> So it goes up to the document
[12:27:45] <albertosh> ok
[12:27:46] <Eviltwin> Staticly binds to that
[12:28:04] <Eviltwin> And makes the WHOLE selector you had the dynamic selector
[12:28:24] <Eviltwin> $("table a").live("click",function(){}) means $(document).on("click","table a",function(){})
[12:28:26] <albertosh> wow got it....
[12:28:33] <albertosh> live sucks a lot then
[12:28:51] <serroba> hello everybody
[12:28:51] <Eviltwin> Yes it does
[12:28:54] <albertosh> let me remove all the lives i have :) hehe
[12:28:56] <serroba> I have a little question
[12:28:58] <Eviltwin> It also builds that "table a" collection first
[12:28:58] <albertosh> thanks so much!
[12:29:03] <Eviltwin> And then entirely throws it away
[12:29:14] <serroba> I want to load a simple JSON information from an external web site
[12:29:18] <serroba> the site is http://meta.mapcity.com/wscopesa/comunas.php
[12:29:38] <serroba> and if you try a simple GET to the site you can get the JSON
[12:29:45] <serroba> without any parameter
[12:30:31] <serroba> but, when I want to do something like $.getJSON('http://meta.mapcity.com/wscopesa/comunas.php').(...); I get a wrong information
[12:30:35] <albertosh> Eviltwin: have you worked with jquery mobile?
[12:31:18] <serroba> in the console of firebug I can see when the petition was made, but I get and response code 200, with an empty informacion
[12:31:34] <jrockjiggz> i have a weird bug of beforeSend not working in chrome
[12:31:48] <serroba> and I don't know why. Could you someone try to say me why happen that??
[12:32:05] <Eviltwin> albertosh: Nom sorry
[12:32:07] <Eviltwin> No, sorry*
[12:32:18] <serroba> mmmm
[12:32:19] <serroba> ok
[12:32:31] <serroba> any idea where can I find?
[12:32:38] <albertosh> Eviltwin: no probs
[12:34:43] <jrockjiggz> in chrome when ajax request, it locks the browser.. until success
[12:36:21] <phlp> jrockjiggz: are you using async:false ?
[12:38:30] <joshsmith> how can I access the lat/lon vars outside of this callback function?
[12:38:30] <joshsmith> http://pastebin.com/vrfs3NL4
[12:38:51] <joshsmith> I've tried to do this multiple ways, and I *know* I'm just being dumb
[12:39:00] <joshsmith> I just can't figure out how dumb I am
[12:39:00] <dw> joshsmith: is there a 'var lat' or similar further up the scope chain?
[12:39:17] <joshsmith> dw: I tried that, and it always ends up undefined
[12:39:20] <dw> if not, then those variables become available as window.lat and window.lon. otherwise they get assigned in the scope tehy were declared
[12:39:30] <dw> are you certain data.query.latitude really contains data?
[12:39:37] <joshsmith> dw: yes, it does
[12:39:42] <dw> alert({ data: data }.toSource()) from inside that function would check
[12:39:43] <joshsmith> I've logged it to the console
[12:39:45] <dw> ok
[12:40:42] <dw> joshsmith: check the surrounding code for var declarations, otherwise, you could try sticking explicit "window.lat =" in there instead of just "lat ="
[12:41:02] <dw> (assigning to global variables is a terrible idea, but it will work :)
[12:41:11] <dw> stakkit: ask here
[12:41:21] <DobreJoe> Hi, I have a shopping cart with a remove button. When the user clicks on the button (third td in a tr) I'd like to retrieve the content of the first td in that row. How could I do that?
[12:41:51] <joshsmith> dw: window.lat is undefinied
[12:41:55] <joshsmith> *undefined
[12:42:01] <ngharo> DobreJoe: $(this).closest('tr').find('td:first').text()
[12:42:02] <dw> DobreJoe: $(':parent td', this)[0] from the onclick
[12:42:15] <DobreJoe> thanks!
[12:42:59] <dw> joshsmith: open up firebug and set a break on property changes on the window object, then run your code. your event handler might not be firing, or is throwing an exception (which firefox has a habit of not propagating to the error console)
[12:47:24] <MayorOfDetroit> I from the the 313, yeah -- that's the Motor City, where the scene is.
[12:47:46] <MayorOfDetroit> They tell me I'm a computer genius, I've got Madonna tattooed on my _____.
[12:50:25] <joshsmith> dw: everything works fine when I do it as an object rather than vars
[12:50:30] <joshsmith> idk why, but it sure does
[12:50:49] <dw> weird. oh well
[12:52:23] <ngharo> joshsmith: your paste would be more helpful if we can see where you're trying to access lat,lon
[12:52:59] <joshsmith> well, all's well because using an object makes more sense to me anyway
[13:01:05] <albertosh> Eviltwin: are you still there? i was able to successfuly make the on work
[13:01:33] <albertosh> Eviltwin: but the off is not working for me and the event is being triggered many times as new images are being created
[13:02:35] <albertosh> Eviltwin: nvr mind was my fault :p
[13:02:38] <hyperjxz> hello again, the same question again... can anyone tell why my jquery-ui tabs that have thesame jquery and ajax form are conflicting? only the first tab executes the form the second only loads it?
[13:02:58] <gaspar|work> Hey, I want to redirect user to specific page by using select-option and NOT the option.val(). I was thinking of using <option rel="url_to_redirect" value="somevalue">sometext</option>, how can I get the url value?
[13:04:54] <dabear> gaspar|work: $("#yourselect option:selected").attr("rel") ?
[13:05:22] <gaspar|work> dabear: Ah, forgot about :selected. Thanks!
[13:06:34] <dabear> the correct way of doing that in an event handler, would be this.options[this.selectedIndex].rel bypassing lookup in the dom
[13:06:38] <dabear> but whatever
[13:08:11] <MW__> Hi, I have strange problem: When I pass whole serialized form using $.ajax() from site A to my .php file everything is fine, then when I pass it from another site using the same settings it throws an error in $.ajaxError() like: "erorr in: 'myfile.php' " But myfile.php is ok. After that my alert box imiediatly hides and send everything to self url with GET method.

[13:15:00] <MW__> Anyone faced similar problem?
[13:15:25] <pur3forlyphe> Hey, is their a way to call another jquery function from another file - i.e. from a plugin? Or do you just include each separate plugin in html?
[13:15:30] <dabear> ?demo @ MW__
[13:15:31] <bot-t> MW__, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.

[13:16:51] <warrenparsons> pur3forlyphe: You either include a call to the plugin file in your HTML or use a script loader.
[13:17:09] <pur3forlyphe> ok n1
[13:17:11] <pur3forlyphe> ty
[13:18:04] <kollapse> Hi. If I do $('#el').click(fn); the function will be executed if I click on #el as well as on any element inside #el. Is there any way I can bind the event to only #el and not its children ?
[13:18:56] <warrenparsons> kollapse: $('#el').not('#el *').click(fn) perhaps?
[13:19:28] <Syco54645_work> i need to have something that is 3 rows high, scrolls left to right with icons on it
[13:19:34] <Syco54645_work> what would something like that be called?
[13:19:41] <Syco54645_work> i tried ribbon but yeah, not called that
[13:21:07] <tonyjcamp> oh hai
[13:21:36] <jbrokc> hey, i'm using .delegate to a bunch of selectors built up a $("#foo").add("#bar").add("#baz").delegate()  and I want to give delegate a bunch of selectors to match on, about 5 classes. the docs don't say anything about multiple selectors - are they comma separated? space?
[13:22:20] <ngharo> kollapse: check event.target in your fn
[13:22:20] <tonyjcamp> Can you use a single class?
[13:22:35] <jbrokc> tonyjcamp: no, it needs to be multiple
[13:22:43] <kollapse> warrenparsons: Not really - http://jsfiddle.net/9cu76/
[13:22:47] <tonyjcamp> I think comma sep
[13:22:54] <warrenparsons> jbeach: Yes, comma separated.
[13:22:58] <warrenparsons> er..
[13:23:05] <warrenparsons> jbrokc: Comma separated.
[13:23:15] <jbrokc> warrenparsons: thanks!
[13:23:32] <jbrokc> warrenparsons: is there a better way of getting multiple elements in one jquery object than doing .add() multiple times?
[13:23:34] <ngharo> kollapse: http://jsfiddle.net/9cu76/1/
[13:24:01] <warrenparsons> jbrokc: Yes, $('#foo, #barr, #baz');
[13:24:16] <kollapse> ngharo: Very nice. Thanks!
[13:24:18] <jbrokc> thanks
[13:24:36] <ngharo> jbrokc: pretty sure add() also accepts a list of elements
[13:24:57] <warrenparsons> jbrokc: .add() is typically only useful when you need to add something to a jQuery object defined elsewhere.
[13:25:11] <jbrokc> yeah
[13:25:15] <warrenparsons> jbrokc: Otherwise, use the CSS selector syntax.
[13:26:05] <warrenparsons> Beer at work = good.
[13:29:00] <DobreJoe> I have a variable that stores the name of a class I want to hide, how could I do something like $(var).hide(); ?
[13:30:22] <ngharo> ?tias @ DobreJoe
[13:30:23] <bot-t> DobreJoe, Try It And See
[13:32:07] <dabear> "." + var
[13:32:26] <DobreJoe> dabear, thnx
[13:32:36] <someprimetime> how can i append a script contents to a container? such as: $.getScript('url_here')
[13:33:22] <dabear> someprimetime: define "script contents"
[13:33:53] <someprimetime> well basically i want to load $.getScript('http://www.stumbleupon.com/hostedbadge.php?s=1') so it displays that button inside of my container
[13:36:03] <dabear> someprimetime: go read the stumbleupon docs
[13:37:37] <someprimetime> dabear: basically i wanted to have it inserted into the DOM after the page has loaded, with $(window).load() since stumbleupon's servers are slow, but when i do something like: var stumble = '<script src="' + 'http://www.stumbleupon.com/hostedbadge.php?s=1' + '">       <\/script>'; $('#social-widget').append(stumble); it isn't appending it
[13:38:30] <ngharo> scripts are stripped out and evaluated in the global scope i believe
[13:38:46] <ngharo> someprimetime: i'd not use jquery for this task.
[13:39:32] <ngharo> you can var s = document.createElement('script'), etc, and append it via el.appendChild(s)
[13:41:11] <someprimetime> ngharo: didn't work unfortunately http://jsfiddle.net/49kkQ/
[13:41:13] <macromancer> someprimetime: you can literally look at the code for Google Analytics to see a working example in use on thousands of sites
[13:41:23] <someprimetime> macromancer: word thanks
[13:41:26] <someprimetime> i'll scope that out
[13:43:40] <pamelafoxx> hey folkz. a jquery plugin i'm using uses $.expr() but it doesnt seem to be officially documented. what's the deal with it?
[13:44:07] <zulax> i m making some simple games
[13:44:29] <zulax> cant decide what framework/engine to use, i have seen craftyjs and limejs
[13:44:58] <Nek> jquery ftw
[13:45:08] <zulax> ftw?
[13:45:12] <Nek> for the win
[13:45:17] <Nek> or fuck the world
[13:45:22] <Nek> same result
[13:45:23] <zulax> even for games? Nek
[13:45:29] <Nek> lol, no.
[13:45:39] <zulax> ok
[13:47:25] <Nek> Go c3dl
[13:48:08] <zulax> cool
[13:48:26] <zulax> can be used for making games?
[13:48:45] <phlp> pamelafoxx: $.expr is Sizzle.selectors which is documented here https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/wiki/Sizzle-Home
[13:51:26] <Snerf> what would cause the "loading" overlay to always show when loading a page with jquerymobile? it does not go away, and my <a links do not go to buttons, even using data-role='button'
[13:51:54] <diegoviola> hi
[13:51:59] <pamelafoxx> @phlp thanks!
[13:58:40] <partydroid> ive got a slight issue with recursion... my loops are fine, its just UL and LI that are a bit messed up http://snip.so/U4bu
[13:59:41] <partydroid> http://pastebin.com/p5q5XLG8
[14:06:02] <phlp> partydroid: looks like on line 7 your obj.find("ul") is finding the ul within ul so maybe try obj.children("ul")
[14:06:39] <partydroid> phlp, thanks for the pointer obj.find("ul:first") did the trick!
[14:06:49] <partydroid> <3
[14:09:35] <sorahn> hey guys, i'm trying to get all siblings after the current item.  the docs say it would be something like $(#currendiv ~ .siblings)
[14:09:38] <sorahn> but that doesn't seem to be working
[14:09:44] <phlp> partydroid: you could also do var ul = $("<ul id=\"ajaxtabs\"></ul>").appendTo(obj); instead of line 4 then use ul.append on line 7 so you dont have to find anything inside the each
[14:13:33] <dabear> sorahn: $(this).siblings()
[14:14:52] <sorahn> dabear: that gets all of it's siblings, i only want the siblings after the current one.
[14:15:12] <dabear> ?nextAll @ sorahn
[14:15:26] <sorahn> botfail
[14:15:41] <dabear> http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[14:15:58] <sorahn> ah ha!
[14:16:59] <abjorn> imsky: make it stop imsky make it stop D:
[14:17:36] <imsky> ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT
[14:17:40] <imsky> WHAT'S GOIN ON HERE
[14:18:32] <quackquack> how can I get an element's position relative to the document?
[14:20:05] <ngharo> ?offset
[14:20:26] <ngharo> :( bot-t
[14:20:38] <dabear> yeah
[14:20:42] <tjholowaychuk> does jquery let you do something like $('<h1>{title}</h1>', { title: something }) ?
[14:20:43] <abjorn> imsky: home sickkkk feel like shiiittt
[14:20:44] <dabear> he's failing me too
[14:20:50] <abjorn> also this is making my mind full of fuck:
[14:20:50] <abjorn> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming
[14:21:07] <abjorn> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)
[14:21:11] <imsky> abjorn: have you been talking to haskell hipsters
[14:21:24] <abjorn> not recently
[14:21:30] <abjorn> i was just curious ;-;
[14:21:32] <imsky> lol
[14:21:33] <abjorn> im less curious now...
[14:21:35] <dabear> tjholowaychuk: no, but you can use $.tmpl from the template plugin. or you can also do $("<h1 />", {innerHTML: something}) without a plugin
[14:21:36] <imsky> yes
[14:21:39] <abjorn> this shit makes NO sense
[14:21:51] <tjholowaychuk> dabear ah, ok thanks
[14:22:12] <imsky> it's designed by tricky neckbeards for tricky neckbeards
[14:22:17] <abjorn> lol
[14:22:23] <imsky> "you don't know how monads work? fucking amateur"
[14:22:53] <imsky> do { m }  = do { v <- m; return v }
[14:22:56] <abjorn> lol i have a friend who is all haskelly he tried to explain and failed. so confused
[14:22:57] <imsky> ^ makes perfect sense to me
[14:23:17] <abjorn> i was only interested because he was able to do quicksort in the size of a tweet in haskell
[14:23:30] <imsky> thank god for that
[14:23:34] <abjorn> couldn't even do dat shit in perl
[14:23:43] <abjorn> but fuck that
[14:23:45] <abjorn> NOT WORTH IT
[14:23:45] <imsky> enterprise applications need that level of compressibility
[14:23:52] <abjorn> ^
[14:23:59] <imsky> hey check it out
[14:24:02] <imsky> i can also do it
[14:24:10] <imsky> a.sort();
[14:24:12] <imsky> tweet-sized!
[14:24:15] <abjorn> yeah that's why our billing admin interface at HostGator is one file of Perl
[14:24:21] <abjorn> one very long file
[14:24:52] <abjorn> made by a pro coder
[14:25:06] <imsky> oh ok
[14:25:09] <imsky> you mean larry wall
[14:25:12] <abjorn> who decided escaping HTML input was highly unnecessary
[14:25:37] <abjorn> and that it only needs to partially work in each respective browser
[14:25:49] <abjorn> some parts work in firefox, some work in chrome
[14:26:28] <imsky> man
[14:26:30] <imsky> that takes skill
[14:26:53] <abjorn> it does
[14:27:28] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/4VeFL/4/
[14:27:33] <thomedy> this is a simple js fiddle
[14:27:37] <thomedy> but my delay isn't working
[14:27:43] <thomedy> i usually use setTimeout()
[14:27:52] <thomedy> but this time i for some reason cant lock it
[14:27:52] <imsky> lol
[14:27:54] <imsky> ?delay
[14:27:55] <thomedy> so i tried delay
[14:28:00] <imsky> ?tom delay
[14:28:02] <thomedy> also cant lock it
[14:28:10] <thomedy> are you asking or caling a bot
[14:28:17] <imsky> bot-t, you have failed me for the last time
[14:28:29] <ngharo> thomedy: try hide('fast')
[14:28:35] <imsky> yeah that should do it
[14:28:43] <imsky> because he wants it to be fast, and not delayed
[14:28:52] <ngharo> haha
[14:28:54] <thomedy> no my hide is fine
[14:28:58] <thomedy> its my delay thasts crap
[14:29:03] <ngharo> hide() is sync, delay only works on animations (async) stuff
[14:29:05] <thomedy> and again i usually use setTime out
[14:29:23] <thomedy> thast fine i am in a whole using it in an animation
[14:29:24] <imsky> thomedy: listen to ngharo
[14:29:28] <imsky> $(this).delay(1000).hide(1);
[14:29:29] <thomedy> i did
[14:29:31] <imsky> ^ works
[14:29:49] <imsky> jquery feels more like php every day
[14:29:51] <thomedy> i put it in i didn't test it
[14:29:52] <thomedy> im sorry
[14:30:02] <thomedy> i was jsut assuming he was correcting my hide and not my delay
[14:30:07] <thomedy> so i apologize
[14:30:10] <thomedy> let me check
[14:30:23] <thomedy> so im not sure why that matters
[14:31:04] <thomedy> again im sorry but now why does that animate hide
[14:31:06] <thomedy> it shrinks
[14:31:12] <imsky> wat
[14:31:14] <thomedy> usually when i hide it just disapears
[14:31:22] <imsky> do .hide(1)
[14:31:41] <thomedy> i did the fast one
[14:31:43] <imsky> or .hide(0) if it makes you feel powerful
[14:31:43] <thomedy> im sorry again
[14:31:51] <thomedy> i think someone said to do fast
[14:31:59] <thomedy> i just wanted to be "not difficult
[14:32:03] <thomedy> but taht did work and thank you]
[14:32:48] <abjorn> it makes me feel powerful
[14:32:51] <abjorn> very powerful
[14:32:54] <abjorn> unlimited
[14:32:57] <abjorn> POOOOOOWWWWWEEEEERRRRRRR
[14:33:55] <imsky> lawl
[14:41:39] <thomedy> thank you very much.. again im on my biggest client ive ever done... 1000
[14:41:47] <thomedy> and i know  you guys do taht all the time im sure
[14:41:52] <thomedy> but a comma is new to me
[14:43:21] <zamba> i'm looking for a graphing tool for jquery
[14:43:30] <zamba> i've been looking at jqplot so far, is that the "best"?
[14:43:32] <phlp> my clients and i shred $1000 bills and snort them like cocaine
[14:43:51] <joshsmith> zamba: I like highcharts
[14:44:46] <zamba> joshsmith: oh, interesting
[14:44:52] <zamba> joshsmith: have you tried jqplot?
[14:45:18] <joshsmith> zamba: briefly, but highcharts seems better
[14:45:27] <joshsmith> zamba: Klout uses highcharts for their graphs, currently
[14:45:34] <phlp> http://code.google.com/p/flot
[14:45:37] <zamba> joshsmith: who/what is klout?
[14:45:52] <joshsmith> zamba: http://klout.com
[14:46:11] <zamba> i just need something -very- simple
[14:46:43] <zamba> never heard about klout
[14:47:51] <joshsmith> can someone help me improve this?  https://gist.github.com/1378009
[14:48:08] <phlp> needs more cowbell
[14:48:21] <jgspratt> hey, I have a http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html and it is doing this thing that messes up my responsiveness: since it sets the height and width of the divs in the html, when I resize my browser, it doesn't know about it, so my divs get overlapped.  how can I not set the height/width and just have my gs.960 responsive grid take care of things by the classes I have assigned?
[14:48:25] <joshsmith> for some reason if the zips obj is just a string, it won't work correctly, which is weird
[14:51:20] <phlp> joshsmith: your getJSON is async so it probably wont return before the console.log(zips) runs
[14:51:44] <joshsmith> phlp: ah, I figured that was probably what was happening
[14:52:25] <Narinik> anyone know why this might allways be failing? http://pastebin.com/rzHq9v75
[14:52:33] <joshsmith> phlp: so should I be using $.ajax with async: false?
[14:52:46] <phlp> absolutely not
[14:53:07] <joshsmith> phlp: oh? why not?
[14:53:32] <phlp> the usual, kitten deaths and such
[14:54:52] <joshsmith> phlp: hah. but seriously, I'm genuinely curious
[14:55:27] <phlp> http://pastebin.com/7wiz0uZV
[14:55:41] <Narinik> is there any way to dump a jqXHR object?
[14:56:17] <joshsmith> phlp: ah that looks much better
[14:59:23] <Hughes> Hello
[14:59:54] <joshsmith> phlp: that's giving me an uncaught referenceerror for callback
[15:00:24] <Hughes> ANy chance anyone's available to help me figure out some jQuery goodness?
[15:00:51] <Hughes> if / else related, I'd imagine..
[15:02:51] <phlp> joshsmith: maybe change it to if (callback) callback(bbox_zips.join(","));
[15:03:00] <someprimetime> is it possible to use input[type=submit] but only on a specific form? since i have 2 forms on the same page
[15:05:27] <Hughes> I'm trying to figure out how to show and hide a div based on interaction with a "fake" form
[15:05:54] <Hughes> Password: test http://aocommunications.accucode.com/tertiary-navigation-test/
[15:06:08] <thomedy> okay im throwing myself out here. im prob 80% done with concept for my client... im going to paste my link on the dev... this is my biggest client ive had and i would like your honesty... gently however because im human but what do you think of the concept
[15:06:13] <thomedy> www.thomedy.com/nondescript
[15:06:17] <thomedy> there are some caveates
[15:06:28] <thomedy> you can only click once until you have to refresh
[15:06:38] <thomedy>  because i havent added the climbing heights
[15:06:41] <thomedy> yet
[15:06:47] <Hughes> If any of the toggles are set to "yes," I want to display one message, and if all are marked "no," show another, all calculated when clicking the final submit button
[15:07:05] <Hughes> ..if that makes sense
[15:09:34] <phlp> thomedy: that is quite the yes no tree question leveler
[15:09:43] <thomedy> do you like it
[15:09:47] <thomedy> im still new
[15:09:53] <thomedy> and though i think i have good ideas
[15:10:01] <thomedy> realizing them still is a task for me
[15:11:09] <vacho> :D
[15:11:54] <Hughes> Is anyone available to help me figure out some if/else stuff?
[15:12:13] <thomedy> hughs where geographically are you
[15:12:19] <Hughes> I think I got a little over my head with what I'm trying to get done
[15:12:22] <Hughes> Colorado, USA
[15:12:23] <Ring0`> Hey. Is it normal that hide/show with many numbers of divs takes pretty long time to be handled?
[15:12:36] <phlp> someone just turned the lights out on me
[15:12:47] <vacho> $('#person-zipcode').val("91000"); ... how come that does not work? I am doing some dom alternations, can that be why?
[15:13:00] <thomedy> phlps im sorry im okay with a no i think i could gain alot from it
[15:13:02] <thomedy> but did you like it
[15:13:25] <phlp> thomedy: i'm not really sure what it is so i can't say
[15:13:38] <Hughes> http://aocommunications.accucode.com/tertiary-navigation-test/
[15:13:40] <thomedy> okay good point
[15:14:00] <Hierofant> Hughes - would switch work better?
[15:14:02] <vacho> ajpiano:
[15:14:04] <thomedy> if it continued to climb in the same fashion as the first click do you thionk that is an alluring boolean representation
[15:14:14] <thomedy> im asking because i really want to do a good job
[15:14:34] <Hughes> I have no idea, Hierofant
[15:14:44] <Hughes> The password to that linked test is.. "test"
[15:15:03] <Hughes> I'm trying to show a div ONLY if one or more questions are ticked 'yes,' and another div if all are ticked 'no'
[15:15:27] <phlp> thomedy: i'm still not following you. i can say that your tree picture needs to be higher res it is stretched a lot
[15:15:32] <DobreJoe> I'm inserting rows in a table and on those inserted elements I'm not able to receive events on them like click or hover. Am I missing something?
[15:15:49] <Haraldson> DobreJoe: use .on with 1.7
[15:15:57] <Haraldson> .delegate with earlier versions
[15:16:10] <DobreJoe> Haraldson: thanks, will try that.
[15:16:14] <Haraldson> as you insert those elements after load, the initial event listener won't pick them up
[15:16:25] <DobreJoe> I see.
[15:16:40] <vacho> can I use the val function with live?
[15:16:53] <Haraldson> vacho: ?
[15:17:16] <thomedy> phlp i appreciate it.. i actually blurred it intentionally to create depth but im realizing now that that may not be good.
[15:17:23] <thomedy> but thats the easiest of any fixes to have
[15:17:26] <thomedy> so im okay with taht
[15:17:29] <vacho> Haraldson: yes... I have a form field that I use val() on,, it works fine until I put it in a lightbox.. I think the lightbox alters the DOM so the val() function cant execute anymore, how can I get around this?
[15:17:41] <Haraldson> well
[15:17:48] <thomedy> in reality you dont need to blur it to create depth so...
[15:17:51] <Haraldson> if you put it in a lightbox, your DOM is probably moved
[15:18:13] <Haraldson> so you would need to re-attach your listener on successfully loading the content (form) into the lightbox
[15:18:15] <vacho> Haraldson: exacly! how can I get around this?
[15:18:24] <Haraldson> or just use .on() or .delegate()
[15:19:10] <Haraldson> your lightbox probably has a complete-callback, you could re-attach the listener there, or use .on() with body or something
[15:19:23] <vacho> ok lemme try
[15:20:43] <someprimetime> is it possible to target a form with using input[type=submit]?
[15:21:13] <someprimetime> like $('#form-id').find('input[type=submit]').val('blah')
[15:22:01] <Haraldson> sure, someprimetime. but you're targeting the submit button, not the form
[15:22:49] <someprimetime> well is there a way to target a specific form? since right now it updates both submit buttons on the page with that balue
[15:22:50] <someprimetime> value, rather
[15:23:27] <someprimetime> or do i have to put an id selector on each submit button?
[15:23:54] <vacho> Haraldson: that didn't work, how do I do it with on?
[15:23:57] <Haraldson> there's a lot of ways to target specific elements
[15:24:07] <Haraldson> vacho: something along the lines of
[15:24:07] <Haraldson> $('parent-element-always-present-selector')
[15:24:07] <Haraldson>     .on('click', 'form-selector', function(e)
[15:24:07] <Haraldson>     {
[15:24:08] <Haraldson>         // do stuff
[15:24:08] <Haraldson>     });
[15:24:43] <Haraldson> your lightbox probably adds DOM towards the end of body, your safest bet is to have that first selector be 'body' or even 'document'
[15:25:24] <Haraldson> (and you would change click to submit for instance)
[15:25:39] <vacho> Haraldson: this is my ugly function: http://pastebin.com/dZz55ytt
[15:26:01] <vacho> Haraldson: on change, it grabs a bunch of lines from a textarea and populates textfields.
[15:26:51] <Haraldson> I seeâ¦ some sort of specialized administration interface for a very specific need? :P
[15:28:08] <Haraldson> vacho: as long as it's .live() it should work...
[15:28:35] <Haraldson> make sure the lightbox removes the source DOM, if not you have duplicate IDs in your DOM
[15:28:55] <vacho> Haraldson:  that's my problem.. it does not work. when I put an alert in live it echoes... so I know it's getting called ..it's pulling the value from the textarea but not populating the textfields.
[15:29:27] <Haraldson> the textarea is in the lightbox, the textfields on the outside?
[15:29:29] <vacho> Haraldson: im using shadowbox, it might duplicate it ur right!! that's what it's probably doing!
[15:29:40] <Haraldson> worth checking out
[15:29:51] <vacho> Haraldson: ur so smart!!! i think that's the problem.. because when I use THIS it works better!
[15:30:19] <Haraldson> hey, glad to be of any help. even better if I cough up something you can use :)
[15:30:40] <vacho> it seems like shadowbox duplicates the content!!
[15:33:01] <abjorn> imsky: ahhhh pepto bismol and advil does wonders
[15:33:16] <imsky> abjorn: painful poops?
[15:33:17] <bot-t> (22 hours 30 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky .
[15:33:21] <imsky> whoa wtf
[15:33:24] <imsky> welcome back bot-t
[15:33:27] <abjorn> rofl
[15:33:32] <abjorn> no
[15:33:38] <abjorn> upset stomach, nasea
[15:33:46] <abjorn> spent most of last night throwing up so that was fun
[15:33:55] <Hughes> Hey, Haraldson.. mind if I bug you for some help? You seem to know your stuff :o
[15:33:57] <abjorn> i think ive got the flu or something
[15:34:02] <vacho> Haraldson: I guess there is no good way of fixing this.. since shadowbox is dupicating the markup and the ID's get screwed up.
[15:34:16] <Haraldson> fire away Hughes, no guarantees on the being helpful part though
[15:34:18] <Haraldson> ;)
[15:34:22] <imsky> abjorn: damn son, drink that bountiful pink juice
[15:34:42] <Hughes> Firs tthings first: http://aocommunications.accucode.com/tertiary-navigation-test/
[15:34:45] <Hughes> Password it 'test'
[15:34:48] <Haraldson> vacho: You could always switch boxâ¦ I've used Fancybox quite a lot. Not a big fan of the code, but it always just â¦ works
[15:34:54] <Hughes> And the section in question is under 'top reasons'
[15:35:13] <Haraldson> ok, what are you trying to accomplish Hughes?
[15:35:36] <vacho> Haraldson: do you know if fancybox duplicates the content?
[15:35:58] <Hughes> So, if any of those yes/no questions are marked yes, I want to show a div on click of the 'check it out' button
[15:36:07] <Haraldson> vacho: it actually moves it and leaves a temporary anchor where it originally came from
[15:36:10] <Hughes> Conversely, if ALL are marked 'no,' I want to show a different div
[15:36:16] <Haraldson> then puts it back on close
[15:36:55] <vacho> Haraldson: hmm... will I get problems with duplicates like im currently having?
[15:37:07] <Haraldson> ok Hughes
[15:37:18] <Haraldson> so you need to run a loop on submit / click on that button
[15:37:59] <Haraldson> you could build an array as you loop over the booleans, to gather more data. then check whether all is yes or all is no or neither
[15:39:40] <Hughes> Could you elaborate? I'm new to this
[15:40:30] <Hughes> I'm n ot sure how I'd go about doing that
[15:40:35] <Haraldson> Yep, I'm writing some pseudo code right now
[15:40:47] <abjorn> imsky: I drank it and it was k
[15:41:05] <imsky> good job buddy
[15:41:47] <Haraldson> Hughes: In the meantime, I need you to do something for me
[15:42:04] <Haraldson> your buttons (show / hide) have IDs
[15:42:16] <Haraldson> there are 5 elements with the ID show, and 5 elements with the ID hide
[15:42:19] <Haraldson> that's a no-go
[15:44:01] <wtcross> hello all, could somebody answer a quick question about events and the jquery ui widget factory? i have tried to find what i am looking for and have been unsuccessful in finding an answer.
[15:44:13] <ajpiano> wtcross: ask away
[15:45:17] <wtcross> i am triggering a custom event from outside of the widget. all i want to do is bind that event to the widget in some way and have a private method within the widget be called when the event is triggered.
[15:45:31] <wtcross> i've never used the widget factory before now
[15:45:44] <wtcross> what i'm doing is binding the event to this.element in _create
[15:45:57] <wtcross> and inside the handler i call the private function
[15:46:08] <wtcross> private method*
[15:46:43] <wtcross> if that is not clear, please let me know. i will try to elaborate
[15:47:19] <wtcross> should i bind the event to the widget when i create it?
[15:47:20] <ajpiano> sounds like it should work
[15:47:23] <wtcross> hmmm
[15:47:30] <ajpiano> i'd have to see code to see why
[15:48:22] <wtcross> i haven't really used custom events much, so i apologize in advance for the noobish question, but would an event named "ribolab.codon_changed" be invalid for some reason?
[15:48:37] <Hughes> Haraldson: Clearly I've beens taring at this too long when I miss such a glaring newbie mistake ;)
[15:48:39] <Hughes> Must be Friday
[15:48:48] <ajpiano> wtcross: no
[15:49:04] <wtcross> that's what i thought - hah
[15:49:07] <ajpiano> wtcross: but... in jquery the event 'namespace' is the second half
[15:49:15] <Haraldson> Hughes: Yep, we've all been there. I've started on my Saturday already, so the haze from Friday is gone
[15:49:16] <ajpiano> "click.foo" not "foo.click"
[15:50:16] <thomedy> okay im going to put it out there one more time... and then im going to move onto the next faze of the concept....
[15:50:21] <thomedy> www.thomedy.com/nondescript
[15:50:25] <wtcross> i see
[15:50:25] <thomedy> tell me wha tyou guys thing
[15:50:27] <thomedy> k
[15:50:34] <wtcross> ajpiano: i will fix that
[15:50:38] <wtcross> ajpiano: thanks for the tip!
[15:50:41] <thomedy> that letter was for my misspellered word
[15:50:44] <ajpiano> ok good luck
[15:51:17] <skamikaze> ?stop @ thomedy
[15:51:18] <bot-t> thomedy, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[15:52:08] <thomedy> are you saying i ned to tag taht onto my code somewhere
[15:52:14] <thomedy> and thank you
[15:52:50] <thomedy> i actually considered using stop in my code
[15:53:01] <skamikaze> thomedy: i'd use it on button click
[15:53:07] <thomedy> in its early fazes but i assumed it stoped the que and that it wouldent animate
[15:53:12] <thomedy> okay thank you
[15:53:32] <thomedy> i will at least check taht out and in all probablity use it
[15:53:32] <devc> thomasvs: or .stop().animate()
[15:53:36] <skamikaze> thomedy: you maybe want to animate by css3 - if not available use js
[15:53:48] <vacho> Haraldson: YOU ARE THE MAN OF THE HOUR..thank you!
[15:53:50] <thomedy> but do you like the the appearance and whats doing
[15:53:50] <Haraldson> Hughes: Something along the lines of this could probably get you started? http://pastebin.com/Kp2FgvfL
[15:55:16] <thomedy> im sorry to press the topic.. but im new and doing the biggest site ive done so far si am really curious of a professionals opinion
[15:58:58] <Hughes> Thanks for the starting point Haraldson
[15:58:59] <Haraldson> thomedy: what kind of site?
[15:59:11] <Haraldson> Was it of any help Hughes?
[15:59:24] <thomedy> im trying to think of wha i can say
[15:59:28] <thomedy> cuz of non disclosure
[15:59:31] <thomedy> but basically
[15:59:36] <thomedy> the website asks a question
[15:59:38] <thomedy> you decide
[15:59:43] <Hughes> I don't know yet--I should have been in my car on the way home from work by now ;)
[15:59:46] <thomedy> and then based on that decision
[15:59:55] <thomedy> the next question follows
[16:00:06] <thomedy> im not sure how much  more i can so im sorry
[16:00:11] <Haraldson> hehe, it's OK
[16:00:12] <Hughes> Quitting time for the weekend.. it looks like it may put me in the right direction. I'll probably be back on here on Monday trying to get it figured out
[16:00:15] <Haraldson> I know the NDA deal
[16:00:23] <thomedy> do you like it
[16:00:27] <thomedy> i really do want to know
[16:00:31] <thomedy> i dont' mean to sound insecure
[16:00:38] <thomedy> but im really tring to provide a good product
[16:00:43] <thomedy> and this is only my second client
[16:00:54] <thomedy> = second paid website
[16:01:16] <ShaunR> Anybody tell me why jqueryui's dialog keeps resizing itself after the first open.  http://jsfiddle.net/4VAWN/ (click open, press escape, click open again, notice the dialog size difference)
[16:01:17] <thomedy> im changing the buttons now but thats minor
[16:01:34] <Haraldson> thomedy: didn't catch your problem
[16:01:39] <thomedy> not a problem
[16:01:45] <thomedy> do you like the interaction with a site
[16:01:46] <thomedy> the site
[16:01:50] <thomedy> are you drawn in
[16:01:56] <thomedy> even though you dont know teh questions
[16:02:05] <Haraldson> that's a very, too, wide a question
[16:02:07] <thomedy> is the imagry inviting
[16:02:13] <thomedy> yeah i know its open ended
[16:02:25] <thomedy> im just really trying to be the best i can
[16:02:27] <thomedy> ummmm
[16:02:40] <thomedy> do you think it functions smoothly
[16:02:48] <thomedy> thats not even really waht im going for
[16:02:56] <thomedy> i guess the open ended question is the one i meant
[16:03:00] <thomedy> but that s open ended
[16:03:09] <devc> thomedy: I think your best bet is to keep working on it. Right now, no it doesn't capture us, but you need a working prototype before we can really grasp what you're doing. I say keep working on it and a lot of your worries/thinking will become obvious to you. You'll see where weaknesses lie and where needs improvement.
[16:03:51] <thomedy> thank you for an honest and polite answer.. thats the kind i like
[16:03:55] <thomedy> i appreciate it
[16:03:56] <devc> thomedy: You're doing well so far... keep that enthusiasm and passion going and you will end up with a great product, I bet.
[16:04:01] <SkyFlyer> I have an issue with appending a bunch of divs.  IE is deafualting to IE7 doc mode and deosn't show anything?  But IE 8 mode works FINE and shows all the divs? how can I debug this? fix this? If I put in the code the same way and hard code it, it shows up in IE 7 doc mode ?
[16:04:15] <thomedy> to be honest though im not sure what to add at this poitn
[16:04:25] <thomedy> not necessarily a support
[16:04:26] <thomedy> problem
[16:04:28] <thomedy> just the case
[16:06:08] <devc> thomedy: Maybe you dont need to add anything, but it's not a finished product, right?
[16:08:26] <felipe_Brz> can I extend the themes found at theme roller for <div>s and so on, so I can use them as if they were panels while still following the general theme?
[16:08:57] <SkyFlyer> anyone experience that with appending and IE 7 mode?
[16:09:38] <Haraldson> SkyFlyer: All I know is that the performance in those old IE versions on "mass appending" stuff is awful
[16:09:50] <Haraldson> never come across nothing happening
[16:11:51] <Avi`> im hiding a div then in the callback saying slideDown('slow');but it never slides back down. the code is pretty basic , http://jsfiddle.net/zuPHr/
[16:12:02] <Avi`> it hides, triggers the console.log, then never slides back down
[16:12:03] <Avi`> FML
[16:12:06] <Avi`> ignore me
[16:12:38] <Avi`> god im so stupid
[16:12:40] <Avi`> you can quote me on that its okay
[16:12:47] <Avi`> ( i was missing a #)
[16:12:48] <imsky> done
[16:12:53] <imsky> [19:12] Avi`: god im so stupid

[16:52:33] <winterpk> ngharo: have you used the resizable grid option?
[16:52:43] <ngharo> nope
[17:30:48] <gordian> coldhead: any recommendation on easy to manage dynamic form creation?

[17:31:33] <gordian> i wanted to run that by you since your placeholder revelation was so spot on last night
[17:33:22] <coldhead> gordian: have you ever used a js template engine?
[17:33:24] <tom__> is there a HOWTO on setting up JQ definitions and docs in PhpSotrm?

[17:34:12] <coldhead> see if maybe this could help, gordian https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/
[17:34:24] <coldhead> or one of the many others
[17:34:45] <gordian> ok thanks, i will look into it!
[17:42:59] <abjorn> You know...I try to be as accepting as I can. But wtf Wiccans are weird.
[17:52:18] <igcewieling1> abjorn: they are no worse than those silly christians *tease*
[17:53:20] <imsky> hmm
[17:53:52] <imsky> *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease* *tease*
[17:54:26] <imsky> check it out abjorn a whole message full of disclaimers
[17:55:01] <igcewieling1> Would have it been better to use a <tongue in cheek> tag?
[17:55:18] <imsky> let me see
[17:55:33] <imsky> no.
[17:55:38] <abjorn> lol
[17:55:46] <abjorn> no theyre
[17:55:48] <abjorn> theyre silliar
[17:55:50] <abjorn> silliar?
[17:55:51] <abjorn> sillier
[17:55:55] <imsky> silliar!!
[17:56:01] <abjorn> theyre fucking weird as hell
[17:56:03] <imsky> all the wiccans i've known had weird ideas about stuff
[17:56:16] <imsky> not really a well-adjusted individual among them
[17:56:39] <imsky> i dunno, it's one thing to hear a devout christian talk about the son of god
[17:56:56] <imsky> it's quite another to hear a wiccan talk about the goddesses and spirits
[17:57:53] <imsky> i mean come on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Goddess_%28Neopaganism%29
[17:58:14] <imsky> "The feminine part of Wicca's duotheistic theological system is sometimes portrayed as a Triple Goddess, her masculine counterpart being the Horned God."
[17:59:38] <igcewieling1> Wiccans seem to have a lot more FUN with their religion.
[17:59:53] <imsky> says who?
[18:00:03] <imsky> the wiccans i've known all have mental issues including depression
[18:00:23] <igcewieling1> most of the ones I've known.
[18:00:29] <imsky> define fun..
[18:01:22] <igcewieling1> I dated a wiccan for a while.  I forget which holiday it was, but the gathering theme was chocolate.
[18:01:31] <oojacoboo> when using delegate() and you're binding to the same element that you are triggering, I'm using .delegate("", "click", function() {});
[18:01:44] <imsky> bro you can get chocolate functions all the time, just go to burning man/san francisco/hippie commune
[18:01:50] <oojacoboo> is there a better way of doing this besides putting the empty quotes?
[18:01:50] <imsky> no need to join a neopagan religion
[18:02:33] <igcewieling1> Maybe I'm just weird.  I did live at a clothing optional campground for 5 years.
[18:02:47] <imsky> oojacoboo: that seems like an odd use of delegate
[18:03:03] <oojacoboo> imsky: yea, but delegate is much more efficient than live
[18:03:10] <imsky> so use it..properly?
[18:03:23] <oojacoboo> ok, well, I am performing the click action on the same element
[18:03:31] <oojacoboo> so the first variable thereâ¦ not sure what to include
[18:03:36] <imsky> 0_o
[18:03:45] <oojacoboo> ?
[18:03:51] <imsky> that element has a parent, doesn't it?
[18:04:12] <oojacoboo> yea, of course I'd need to change my DOM
[18:04:22] <imsky> wat lol
[18:04:38] <oojacoboo> well, so I have a clean target at least
[18:05:02] <oojacoboo> an id to call rather than some bs DOM level selector
[18:05:17] <oojacoboo> running selector
[18:05:18] <imsky> there it is
[18:05:20] <oojacoboo> or whatever you want to call it
[18:05:22] <imsky> "i want my code to be elegant"
[18:05:27] <imsky> ^ the root of all evil
[18:05:28] <oojacoboo> yea ok?
[18:05:39] <oojacoboo> well, sorry for giving a fuck ;)
[18:05:44] <imsky> man
[18:05:48] <imsky> you delegate to an empty string
[18:05:57] <imsky> i think that's the definition of DGAF
[18:06:00] <oojacoboo> the reason I asked is b/c it doesn't seem right ;)
[18:06:07] <oojacoboo> so yea
[18:06:07] <imsky> because it's..not
[18:06:10] <oojacoboo> no shit
[18:06:15] <imsky> so use it properly
[18:06:24] <oojacoboo> yea, so, I'm working on that
[18:06:38] <oojacoboo> what if you have one item, an anchor that you want to setup delegate to?
[18:06:45] <oojacoboo> why would you delegate this to the parent?
[18:07:00] <oojacoboo> and if delegate is more efficient than live(), wouldn't you just use it...
[18:07:02] <imsky> ?delegate
[18:07:02] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[18:07:09] <imsky> ON A SPECIFIC SET OF ROOT ELEMENTS
[18:07:26] <oojacoboo> yea, and?
[18:07:34] <imsky> so that's the way it's set up maaan
[18:07:37] <oojacoboo> I'm talking about the case where you have one
[18:07:38] <coldhead> how dare you mock wiccans, imsky
[18:07:48] <imsky> coldhead: you're like triple-atheist, shut yo mouth child
[18:07:50] <coldhead> religions should be as weird as possible
[18:08:03] <coldhead> i am a card carrying PANTHEIST
[18:08:06] <imsky> oojacoboo: well then why would you even do a .delegate
[18:08:10] <imsky> coldhead: hipster
[18:08:15] <oojacoboo> b/c it's more efficient than live()
[18:08:15] <coldhead> my official panthiest card is MADE OF GOD
[18:08:19] <igcewieling1> oojacoboo: Maybe I'm just a n00b, but it doesn't seem like you are specifying a set of elements.
[18:08:22] <imsky> oojacoboo: but you have...ONE element
[18:08:35] <imsky> coldhead: triple atheist son of a bitch
[18:08:36] <oojacoboo> so, you're telling me it's the same?
[18:08:51] <imsky> oojacoboo: you use .live or .delegate when you anticipate the dom changing with more of these things
[18:08:52] <coldhead> and imsky you can pretend christianity isn't weird. zombie jesus? fathered by a dove? the whole awesome weird catholic saint pantheon?
[18:08:54] <oojacoboo> only one binding event regardless?
[18:09:07] <imsky> coldhead: whoa whoa whoa. there's catholics and then there are the others
[18:09:15] <imsky> let's not get into the schism here
[18:09:18] <coldhead> the ones who speak in tongues being the others/
[18:09:23] <imsky> among others
[18:09:23] <coldhead> there are weirdos everywhere
[18:09:27] <imsky> tru dat
[18:09:34] <coldhead> but i happen tolove my triple goddess and horned god
[18:09:35] <imsky> so why can't the damn wiccan joiners join a weird christian sect
[18:09:40] <igcewieling1> <-- devout atheist.
[18:09:46] <coldhead> i won't have you bad mouth them unless you're being very funny
[18:09:47] <imsky> lol duo-theistic religion has a triple goddess
[18:09:54] <imsky> that would make it a quad-theistic religion, i think
[18:09:59] <imsky> sponsored by intel corp.
[18:10:08] <igcewieling1> coldhead: regardless of if he is being serious or being funny -- it is still funny.
[18:10:10] <coldhead> floating point bug theism
[18:10:25] <imsky> coldhead: i'm more even-handed when it comes to religion, i can't be funny and make fun of it
[18:10:34] <imsky> atheists though
[18:10:43] <coldhead> those guys have cancer
[18:10:48] <coldhead> and no gods to save them
[18:10:48] <imsky> cancer of the dick
[18:10:50] <coldhead> it's very sad
[18:11:13] <imsky> oojacoboo: yah only one event
[18:11:13] <coldhead> fortunately as a pantheist i believe the cancer is god
[18:11:19] <imsky> why in the hell would you use .live on one element
[18:11:20] <coldhead> so i pray to my cancers
[18:11:24] <oojacoboo> yea, cool, so live() it is there
[18:11:27] <imsky> jesus christ
[18:11:31] <imsky> why live?!
[18:11:45] <imsky> just use .bind like a normal person
[18:12:12] <oojacoboo> wha
[18:12:25] <imsky> can't tell if trolling...
[18:12:27] <oojacoboo> I thought live() was the new function
[18:12:33] <imsky> the new function for what?
[18:12:39] <oojacoboo> binding
[18:12:44] <imsky> 0_\
[18:13:01] <oojacoboo> actually, .on
[18:13:06] <oojacoboo> that's what I want
[18:13:11] <oojacoboo> *meant
[18:13:14] <imsky> yeah that sounds exactly like what you need
[18:13:14] <imsky> ?on
[18:13:15] <bot-t> The new jQuery 1.7+ way of handling events: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:13:18] <oojacoboo> ha
[18:13:49] <oojacoboo> it is though, no?
[18:14:01] <imsky> i dunno man, be on the cutting edge for your one element
[18:14:02] <imsky> why not
[18:14:13] <oojacoboo> it's more about learning man
[18:14:14] <imsky> TODAY, MY SINGLE <A> WILL BE 1.7-COMPATIBLE
[18:15:10] <imsky> $("body").on("click", "p", function(){
[18:15:11] <imsky> ^ lol
[18:15:36] <oojacoboo> yea, aight, we know who's trolling here
[18:16:11] <imsky> you caught me
[18:16:20] <oojacoboo> it's all good though, I don't use 1.7
[18:16:24] <imsky> it was my plan all alone
[18:16:33] <imsky> to troll hard about the on handle
[18:16:50] <oojacoboo> yea, instead of getting off, you're all about getting on
[18:17:11] <imsky> say waa
[18:18:06] <oojacoboo> imsky: get your groove .on()
[18:18:12] * imsky wiggles
[18:18:51] <luite> should jquery-ui 1.9m6 work ok with jquery 1.7?

[18:25:47] <davidbanham> I'm making a POST request to a page that returns a bunch of set-cookies and a 302. JQuery follows the location in the 302, but doesn't send the cookies from the first request along with the second. Without the cookies, the request just fails.

[18:31:54] <imsky> coldhead: something to cheer you up: http://alteredqualia.com/three/examples/webgl_materials_skin.html
[18:32:01] <coldhead> the cursed becomes the cursor
[18:32:19] <coldhead> Your graphics card does not seem to support WebGL.
[18:32:28] <imsky> u lose good day sirrah
[18:32:55] <coldhead> Hmm. While your browser seems to support WebGL, it is disabled or unavailable.
[18:33:04] <coldhead> what do i dooo
[18:33:10] <imsky> what browser do you rooon
[18:33:16] <coldhead> chromium

[18:36:33] <imsky> get that grandpa ass into the new threads
[18:37:04] <coldhead> it still is nice
[18:37:47] <imsky> well enjoy your non-css-transition having browser
[18:38:32] <coldhead> i'm on ubuntu 10.04 lts
[18:38:41] <coldhead> it's like living in a museum
[18:38:49] <imsky> a year old museum
[18:38:52] <coldhead> and it's only 18 months old
[18:39:19] <imsky> windows 8 will make your linux totally obsolete
[18:39:35] <coldhead> i sure couldn't be bothered installing a new os
[18:40:12] <imsky> your backward ways amuse and worry me
[18:40:34] <coldhead> me too
[18:42:10] <hightekvagabond> what is the preffered jquery way to find out if an element doesn't exists?  I tried if ($(divid) == undefined) and that was a fail
[18:42:37] <imsky> what do you think $(divid) returns if there are no divs with that id?
[18:43:18] <yogurt_truck> it returns jquery's soul
[18:43:19] <coldhead> an empty set?
[18:43:29] <hightekvagabond> that was the questionâ¦.  :P
[18:43:29] <coldhead> $({})
[18:43:41] <imsky> don't listen to that, he's just posting genitalia now
[18:43:54] <coldhead> hightekvagabond: if ($('noexisty').length === 0)
[18:44:08] <imsky> wow the type too huh
[18:44:24] <coldhead> i am being formal, imsky
[18:44:27] <coldhead> i am wearing a tie
[18:44:29] <hightekvagabond> thanks coldhead
[18:44:44] <imsky> coldhead: i can visualize it
[18:44:46] <DofLeFou> Greetings â¦ With  $("form").submit(); â¦ is possible to possible to passed in the data
[18:44:56] <imsky> it is very possible to possible
[18:44:57] <thisgeek> coldhead: Any reason not to use the shorter if ($('thingy').length)
[18:45:14] <imsky> thisgeek: type coercion, but coldhead is still on 3.5, so he has an even more dickheaded reason
[18:45:21] <DofLeFou> I have couple of list â¦ I wanted to include on the post
[18:45:32] <DofLeFou> sorry submit
[18:45:38] <coldhead> i gave the didactic form, thisgeek
[18:45:49] <coldhead> hightekvagabond: is welcome to make it look more like line noise

[19:10:10] <ryanneufeld> I'm lazy
[19:10:19] <imsky> i don't think we know each other...
[19:10:23] <ryanneufeld> nope
[19:10:32] <imsky> so...why would you say "coming from you"
[19:10:50] <ryanneufeld> based on how you've been talking to me
[19:10:57] <imsky> but you admitted you're maladjusted
[19:11:04] <ryanneufeld> did i?
[19:11:09] <imsky> [22:09] ryanneufeld: I am
[19:11:11] <imsky> lol

[19:17:27] <imsky> abjorn: you too huh
[19:17:32] <abjorn> ?
[19:18:11] <yogurt_truck> what's LoL
[19:18:18] <yogurt_truck> nevermind
[19:19:01] <abjorn> lol
[19:19:07] <abjorn> by that im guessing you figured it out
[19:19:44] <abjorn> ryanneufeld is pro troll'r
[19:20:00] <imsky> brofessional
[19:20:26] <oojacoboo> everybody get your troll .on()
[19:20:45] <imsky> hey there it is
[19:22:32] <joshsmith> I know I'm not doing some things right here, so I'd appreciate some thoughts on how to do it better: https://gist.github.com/1378009
[19:23:37] <arcanez> is there something built in or an idiom to allow me to make multiple getJSON requests until I get all the data back I want? (I am paging on the backend so my json responses aren't too large per request)
[19:24:23] <abadr> joshsmith: get_nearby_zips should take a callback argument that it sends the result to, instead of writing it to the `zips` variable in the outer scope. that's the biggest problem.
[19:25:47] <joshsmith> abadr: I tried implementing that but clearly failed. could you fork or jsfiddle?
[19:26:29] <abjorn> i feel like throwing up
[19:26:35] <abjorn> but i cant
[19:26:38] <abjorn> thats the worst feeling
[19:26:43] <imsky> yes
[19:26:47] <abadr> joshsmith: sure, one min
[19:26:55] <abjorn> it's like having to sneez but not being able to, but like 10x worse
[19:26:57] <joshsmith> abadr: thanks, appreciated
[19:27:05] <oojacoboo> abjorn: they make medicine for that
[19:27:19] <oojacoboo> to induce vomiting
[19:27:25] <abjorn> gross
[19:27:39] <abjorn> lol man this pepto aint workin
[19:27:40] <imsky> abjorn: just drink whatever non-macho tea you have in the house
[19:27:43] <oojacoboo> it's very useful, especially if a child drinks something they shouldn't have
[19:27:50] <abjorn> tru
[19:27:53] <imsky> MAKE A CAULDRON
[19:27:57] <imsky> OF GAY TEA
[19:28:01] <abjorn> man fuck tea
[19:28:03] <abjorn> i hate tea
[19:28:07] <imsky> ...yeah
[19:28:08] <imsky> exactly
[19:28:19] <oojacoboo> have a carbonated beverage
[19:28:23] <oojacoboo> it settles the stomach
[19:28:31] <imsky> oojacoboo: holy crap you're full of bad advice
[19:28:40] <abjorn> hm, we have some carbonated water downstairs...
[19:28:41] <oojacoboo> it's very true
[19:28:51] <imsky> oojacoboo: when has that ever helped you
[19:28:52] <abjorn> not sure
[19:28:53] <abjorn> if trolling
[19:29:05] <abadr> joshsmith: I can't figure out how to show a diff, but: https://gist.github.com/1378384/0ea5fb333567e5dd07825907f9e8e67ffdd46890
[19:29:08] <imsky> yes trolling dude. i've had fizzy water before while being fucked up, it just makes you feel 3.5x worse
[19:29:11] <abadr> I think this is right, haven't tested it
[19:29:29] <oojacoboo> abjorn: no joking man
[19:29:42] <oojacoboo> http://www.ehow.com/list_6162284_effects-soft-drinks-stomach.html
[19:29:46] <joshsmith> abadr: k, give me a sec to check it out
[19:29:51] <dw> um
[19:30:00] <dw> carbonated drinks reduce stomach acidity
[19:30:07] <imsky> carbonation effect = get activated charcoal instead
[19:30:28] <imsky> bitches don't know bout my MEDICAL DOCTORATE
[19:30:45] <dw> #jquery: less facts, more attitude
[19:30:52] <imsky> moar aptitude
[19:31:03] <imsky> apt-get antacid
[19:31:06] <oojacoboo> http://www.livestrong.com/article/113704-stomachache-remedies/
[19:31:21] <abjorn> "However, soft drink carbonation can actually irritate the stomach acids, and often eventually results in stomach bloating and more gas."
[19:31:22] <LessSeen> apt-get laxitive
[19:31:23] <imsky> i like how oojacoboo justifies this stuff with links to content farms
[19:31:35] <oojacoboo> yea, there aren't any good ones
[19:31:36] <oojacoboo> :/
[19:31:41] <imsky> why not i wonder
[19:31:43] <oojacoboo> livestrong isn't bad though
[19:31:44] <dw> this topic has absolutely nothing to do with this channel.
[19:31:49] <joshsmith> abadr: ah, perfect. what I forgot to do before was to add the last arg to the function definition for callback
[19:31:57] <imsky> abjorn: I TOLD YOU
[19:32:06] <joshsmith> abadr: anything else you can see I should be doing differently? even if it's minor...
[19:32:38] <oojacoboo> jquery caused an upset stomach dw
[19:32:44] <oojacoboo> it's all about the full solution
[19:33:22] <imsky> joshsmith: i like your email
[19:33:38] <imsky> i want mine to be delay@goals.com
[19:33:42] <imsky> and goats@goals.com
[19:33:52] <joshsmith> oh man, I should update my email
[19:33:56] <joshsmith> I don't have that domain any longer
[19:34:02] <imsky> what a domain though
[19:34:07] <abadr> joshsmith: well, this is a stylistic choice, but I'd get rid of the "else" clause so as to reduce the indentation. (This is ok since your'e returning in the `err` case.)
[19:34:23] <imsky> plz emal me at goats@goals.com
[19:34:26] <donCams> that domain is now worth millions i suppose
[19:34:33] <donCams> goals.com? :)
[19:34:37] <abadr> Other than that, I'd be looking for a way to reduce the repetitive math code
[19:34:46] <imsky> 80 millions
[19:34:58] <joshsmith> ah yeah, it's more of a placeholder for error handling at some point
[19:35:08] <donCams> and you own that?
[19:35:19] <imsky> expire date: mar 14, 2017
[19:35:22] <imsky> LET'S JUST WAIT A FEW YEARS
[19:35:24] <joshsmith> no, I leased it for awhile
[19:35:40] <joshsmith> abadr: howso on the math?
[19:35:42] <imsky> joshsmith: i got dibs
[19:35:45] <imsky> on goals.com
[19:36:03] <joshsmith> good luck. the dude wants at least $1M for it
[19:36:14] <imsky> you let it lapse?
[19:36:17] <imsky> it's like 10 bucks a year
[19:36:37] <abadr> joshsmith: alright, i'll give it a shot...
[19:36:53] <joshsmith> abadr: you could comment on the gist, too
[19:37:16] <joshsmith> the large formulas are pretty hard to reduce
[19:37:21] <joshsmith> they're all variations of Haversine
[19:37:30] <joshsmith> but each is slightly different
[19:37:42] <abadr> joshsmith: functional programming
[19:37:59] <imsky> abadr: imperative programming
[19:39:37] <abadr> joshsmith: also, using camelCase is more typical for javascript than underscore_seperated, though I personally prefer the latter as well
[19:40:00] <joshsmith> abadr: I actually personally prefer camelCase, so if that's more typical, then it's fine by me
[19:40:14] <joshsmith> underscores are easier to read, but more difficult to type
[19:41:26] <xaxxon> how do I add a method to.. whatever comes back from somethig like $('div').. I wnat to say $('div').myfunction
[19:41:37] <imsky> ?plugins
[19:41:40] <bot-t> imsky, Project types | jQuery Plugins - http://plugins.jquery.com/
[19:41:44] <imsky> ooh nice
[19:41:50] <imsky> ?g authoring plugins @ xaxxon
[19:41:50] <bot-t> xaxxon, Plugins/Authoring - jQuery JavaScript Library - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[19:41:55] <xaxxon> ok
[19:42:00] <xaxxon> ..hoping this isn't hard
[19:42:12] <imsky> oh it's a peach
[19:42:18] <imsky> takes most people like 3.2 minutes
[19:42:51] <xaxxon> I think I basically want to learn how to write this: http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/touchstart
[19:43:03] <imsky> oh ok
[19:43:08] <imsky> 9.3 minutes then
[19:44:00] <xaxxon> well, I know how to do all the touch event stuff.. but I think I got this
[19:48:57] <xaxxon> feels weird writing a jquery plugin in coffeescript
[19:49:37] <Eviltwin> Just write it in JavaSCript
[19:49:42] <xaxxon> yeah, I could..
[19:49:48] <xaxxon> but this is a challenge :)
[19:50:02] <xaxxon> at least for me
[19:50:55] <abadr> joshsmith: yeah, it's a little complex, but basically you could make a function that combines the _lat_rad math, and another for the _lon_rad math. probably not worth it.
[19:51:23] <joshsmith> yeah, you're probably right
[19:51:33] <abadr> that's all i got
[19:51:36] <joshsmith> such a long function for something incredibly simple
[19:51:43] <joshsmith> well, thanks. I appreciate it, dude
[19:51:50] <abadr> you're welcome
[20:05:59] <abjorn> imsky: ahhhh i ate some toast and feel so much better
[20:06:38] <imsky> it's that damn carbon
[20:06:41] <imsky> was it kinda...charred?
[20:06:51] <abjorn> just a bit, im not a fan of burnt toast
[20:06:54] <abjorn> but it did the trick
[20:07:52] <imsky> it's dat carbon
[20:16:44] <xaxxon> I may be a bit slow, but I've got my plugin working :)   Thank you
[20:17:00] <imsky> good job bud
[20:17:16] <xaxxon> :)
[20:18:11] <abjorn> workan on a behavior trees implementation for impactjs :3
[20:19:30] <imsky> let me get a sneek peek bro
[20:19:51] <abjorn> I've just got the base node class atm
[20:20:27] <imsky> :4
[20:32:07] <abjorn> imsky: https://github.com/Abjorn/impact-behaviortree
[20:32:40] <abjorn> no documentation, awww yeeaah
[20:32:47] <imsky> lol
[20:32:51] <imsky> you're gonna forget what that stuff does
[20:32:55] <imsky> iiiin 2 hours
[20:33:01] <abjorn> nah
[20:42:41] <abjorn> imsky: adding a readme right now
[20:43:46] <KostasDi> hey guys.. quick question
[20:44:54] <imsky> word ups
[20:44:56] <KostasDi> whats the best way to go from 'abcde' to {'a':{'b':{'c':{'e'}}}}
[20:45:09] <imsky> KostasDi: go to the start menu, click shut down
[20:45:28] <KostasDi> interesting solution, but no
[20:45:48] <imsky> so you really don't know
[20:45:59] <imsky> have you heard the gospel of the for loop yet, my son?
[20:46:17] <KostasDi> yeah..
[20:46:26] <imsky> theeen
[20:46:32] <imsky> wtf are you doing asking this question
[20:46:36] <imsky> it's not even jquery related
[20:46:51] <KostasDi> for a better answer than a for loop
[20:47:29] <KostasDi> nvm
[20:48:18] <imsky> well
[20:48:26] <imsky> let's see
[20:50:41] <xaxxon> seems like recursion would be easier than a for loop
[20:51:02] <imsky> winning answer right here
[20:51:31] <xaxxon> recurse all the way in, then on the way back out, add the result to a hash you just created
[20:51:50] <xaxxon> I have a new interview question :)
[20:52:06] <xaxxon> anyone want to move to seattle?  You already know an interview question :)
[20:52:17] <imsky> hahahahaha
[20:52:21] <imsky> you're a funny guy xaxxon
[20:52:24] <xaxxon> I try
[20:52:29] <xaxxon> but I seriously am hiring
[20:53:25] <xaxxon> I'll split the referral bonus with you!
[20:53:47] <xaxxon> that's the good news.  bad news is you'd work for me :\
[20:54:31] <aca20031> and do web development
[20:54:32] <aca20031> and be in seattle
[20:54:48] <sente> how can I find out what's bound to various events for a given element
[20:55:30] <imsky> xaxxon: i'll have an answer shortly
[20:55:33] <xaxxon> oh, it's not really web dev :)
[20:55:33] <sente> I'm in firebug trying to avoid reading obfuscated JS code to know what happens when I click a link
[20:57:24] <xaxxon> hrmm? can you set a breakpoint?
[20:57:25] <xaxxon> not sure
[21:00:18] <xaxxon> maybe add your own handler to it and set a breakpoint there?  then keep stepping to go into other code?
[21:04:59] <sente> hrm
[21:11:54] <imsky> KostasDi: i got it
[21:12:26] <imsky> ?js "test"
[21:12:26] <bot-t> imsky: "test"
[21:12:28] <imsky> ok
[21:12:30] <imsky> ?js "abcde".split("").reduceRight(function(x,y){ var a = {}; a[y]=x; return a;  },{});
[21:12:31] <bot-t> imsky: {"a": {"b": {"c": {"d": {"e": {}}}}}}
[21:12:58] <abjorn> magic
[21:13:02] <imsky> magical
[21:14:01] <imsky> ?js "imsky".split("").reduceRight(function(x,y){ var a = {}; a[y]=x; return a;  },{});
[21:14:02] <bot-t> imsky: {"i": {"m": {"s": {"k": {"y": {}}}}}}
[21:14:05] <imsky> so hot right now
[21:14:43] <imsky> xaxxon: there's your interview question, gimme a job
[21:16:56] <thomedy> okay im going to paste bin i feel close
[21:16:58] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/pMEU8XUV
[21:17:12] <thomedy> if someone could look at that and tell me if i am close and how close
[21:17:29] <thomedy> it should be obvoious whats going on
[21:17:39] <imsky> lol it's obviously wrong
[21:17:45] <imsky> just look at the whitespace
[21:18:02] <thomedy> thats fine
[21:18:15] <imsky> orl
[21:18:16] <imsky> y
[21:18:22] <imsky> did you know animate takes 2 parameters
[21:18:32] <thomedy> yeah i animate all the time
[21:18:43] <imsky> oh yea? what are they?
[21:18:46] <thomedy> if you dont add the time parameter it has a default speed
[21:18:57] <imsky> touche, you're not a noob
[21:19:02] <imsky> still nooby code though
[21:19:08] <thomedy> okay im fine with that
[21:19:21] <thomedy> im def trying to learn standards but im teaching myself so google is all i have
[21:19:59] <imsky> ok so what do the buttons do exactly
[21:19:59] <thomedy> i prostrate myself before your non noobe expertise
[21:20:03] <imsky> seems like a bunch of garbage to me
[21:20:10] <thomedy> i have 2 arrow gifs
[21:20:27] <thomedy> and it animates the height of a div
[21:20:31] <thomedy> obv up and down
[21:20:36] <imsky> oh is that what it does
[21:20:42] <thomedy> i tried
[21:20:45] <imsky> seems like it MOVES a div
[21:20:51] <imsky> by using the bottom property
[21:20:52] <thomedy> thast the inside div
[21:20:59] <imsky> your project sounds broken
[21:21:10] <thomedy> it actually si working quite nice
[21:21:15] <thomedy> but im just on this step right now
[21:21:25] <thomedy> if you want you can see it
[21:21:29] <thomedy> im pretty proud of myself
[21:21:36] <thomedy> im no pro but im getting better
[21:21:42] <imsky> yeah, live links are great
[21:21:56] <thomedy> live links the chat room for lonely people
[21:22:09] <thomedy> or live links something else cuz im not sure what you mean
[21:22:13] <imsky> what the hell
[21:22:22] <imsky> ?js "paste the link to your broken ass project"
[21:22:23] <bot-t> imsky: "paste the link to your broken ass project"
[21:22:26] <thomedy> just a small punchline cuz i enjoy them
[21:22:53] <imsky> i enjoy giving free tech support at midnight
[21:23:28] <thomedy> you dont have to... i honestly would rather not deal with the negativity i can figure it out
[21:23:37] * imsky takes a bow
[21:23:38] <thomedy> i appreciate your skill level for sure
[21:23:40] <thomedy> but taht was rude
[21:23:47] <imsky> teaching self reliance one day at a time
[21:23:59] <abjorn> the way you talk confuses me thomedy
[21:24:12] <thomedy> i just type faster than i should probably
[21:24:23] <abjorn> granted, i have the flu, a headache, and it's midnight
[21:24:39] <imsky> and i just solved a badass challenge
[21:24:44] <abjorn> fuck yeah
[21:24:48] <imsky> IN JABOSCRIPT
[21:24:54] <abjorn> I concede to your badassery imsky
[21:25:01] <thomedy> any ways theres no reason to get all riled up over such silly things... so i will bid you guys adeu and allow you to enjoy your evenings
[21:25:02] <imsky> coming hot off my other triumph of fitting in jq-wiggle IN A TWEET
[21:25:04] * imsky wiggles

[21:25:40] <thomedy> i do want help but i dont
[21:25:45] <thomedy> want to cause a problem
[21:25:48] <thomedy> or deal with one
[21:25:50] <thomedy> and again
[21:25:52] <thomedy> you are smarter
[21:25:54] <imsky> you're in the most relaxed channel on freenode
[21:25:55] <thomedy> i recognize that
[21:26:09] <abjorn> imsky: more relaxed than ##javascript
[21:26:09] <thomedy> okay redo...
[21:26:38] <thomedy> im trying to animate to the bottom/top of a inner div as you press the gif up arrow or down arrow
[21:26:49] <thomedy> so i went with animate({}).stop
[21:26:59] <thomedy> ibut it does nothing

[21:36:37] <SkyFlyer> any one know any good way to get a local timezone time based on a distant time and timezone.   Example. event is at 10:30 pm on Sunday the 30th in New York.  What time / day is that in the phillipines ?
[21:36:48] <imsky> SkyFlyer: use teh googles
[21:38:29] <SkyFlyer> yeah, how can i do it...   based on a timezone and time, I get gmt difference and apply that somehow to the new timezone?
[21:39:02] <imsky> you got it pardna
[21:42:55] <thomedy> okay that took a sec but here yougo
[21:42:56] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/x6C7k/3/
[21:44:30] <thomedy> i think it may actually be my mouse down function
[21:44:54] <abjorn> so what exactly is this supposed to be doing
[21:45:01] <imsky> MAGIC
[21:45:08] <thomedy> the pastebin i would like to hit the button
[21:45:16] <thomedy> and scroll to the button as long as hold donw
[21:45:16] <imsky> just remove .stop() and omg
[21:45:20] <thomedy> really
[21:45:31] <thomedy> i actually that that was reqired or it would scroll without contrall
[21:45:33] <thomedy> control
[21:45:39] <abjorn> er, no
[21:45:42] <abjorn> stop...stops the animation
[21:45:44] <imsky> lol
[21:45:47] <abjorn> ...immediately
[21:45:53] <abjorn> so you create an animation that never even runs
[21:45:57] <thomedy> you know what i rmember why i  didi it
[21:46:09] <thomedy> the alst time used it i was doing a diff animation and i wasn't thinking
[21:47:06] <thomedy> wait im trying it now in my code but i only want it to animate as long as the button is down...
[21:47:14] <thomedy> and only to the bottom if it down long enough
[21:47:22] <thomedy> and your saying i don't need stop
[21:47:47] <thomedy> because context would imply that it would go no matter what once i pres the mouse
[21:47:51] <thomedy> let me try it
[21:47:53] <thomedy> but its a concern
[21:48:43] <thomedy> yep thats exactly what it did
[21:48:51] <abjorn> http://jsfiddle.net/x6C7k/3/
[21:48:53] <abjorn> oops
[21:48:55] <abjorn> didnt save
[21:48:59] <abjorn> http://jsfiddle.net/x6C7k/4/
[21:49:29] <thomedy> oh of course totally makes sense
[21:49:37] <abjorn> and
[21:49:38] <thomedy> just add the mouse up anim stop and you stop
[21:49:39] <thomedy> thank you
[21:49:40] <abjorn> if you want a delay on that
[21:49:44] <abjorn> .delay(duration)
[21:49:45] <abjorn> ?delay
[21:49:46] <bot-t> .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[21:49:48] <thomedy> right i knwo delay
[21:49:50] <thomedy> but thakn kyou
[21:49:53] <abjorn> np

[22:13:12] <thomedy> im  okay with criticism i always wanht to learn
[22:13:23] <thomedy> right now im trying to pin down a good font
[22:13:27] <thomedy> before i go back to js
[22:13:33] <thomedy> cuz im done with that for a minute
[22:13:42] <thomedy> all of what your seein was done in alittle over a day
[22:13:51] <thomedy> its all dummy content
[22:14:00] <thomedy> because ihavent pitched the concept to my client yet
[22:14:02] <thomedy> but i like it
[22:14:17] <thomedy> oh its going to take fore ver to load till i get adiff pic
[22:14:22] <thomedy> becuase tha tbackground pick is huge

[22:21:48] <imsky> lol
[22:21:50] <imsky> dammit
[22:22:08] <imsky> thomedy: why are you reimplementing scrollbars?
[22:23:54] <thomedy> if you keep adding the yeses or nos
[22:24:00] <thomedy> the content at the bottom keeps growing
[22:24:08] <thomedy> so if you want you can choose an earlier content
[22:24:10] <thomedy> and go back to it
[22:24:37] <thomedy> or are you asking why im no tjus tusing visibilityy scroll
[22:24:47] <thomedy> if thats the question i dont' like the scroll bar by default
[22:25:09] <imsky> :(
[22:25:16] <imsky> you make smart panda sad
[22:25:19] <thomedy> with my most honest critic available right now i open myself up to growth
[22:25:22] <thomedy> what do you guys think
[22:25:39] <imsky> i think you just wasted tons of your own time reimplementing a feature that is part of the OS
[22:25:51] <thomedy> is that the scroll thing
[22:25:58] <imsky> maybe
[22:26:10] <imsky> ok, let me introduce you to two concepts
[22:26:12] <thomedy> i think it looks good and function and design are equal to me
[22:26:15] <thomedy> and im listening
[22:26:17] <imsky> since you've already sunk a ton of goddamn time into this
[22:26:24] <imsky> and i'd hate for you not to learn this

[22:38:40] <abjorn> later
[23:11:12] <xaxxon> some of my divs that I have set to position absolute in css have been set to position relative.. presumably by something in jquery I'm doing.  any idea what that might be?  (vague)
[23:11:41] <xaxxon> ah I believe it's because I'm calling offset
[23:11:54] <xaxxon> what do I do to absolutely position a div?  is offset the wrong thing?
[23:29:21] <xaxxon> how do I set the location of an element with absolute positioning?  I believe that using offset sets the positioning to relative
[23:30:15] <xaxxon> do I really just use css()?  *sigh*
[23:31:57] <xaxxon> position is dumb.. why doesn't it let me set the position like offset does
