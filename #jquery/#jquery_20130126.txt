[00:02:18] <systemfault> Nice one.. I would have bought that one over the s3 if I could.
[00:02:42] <systemfault> It's still an android though...
[00:04:03] <someprimetime> wait so you have an s3 but you don't like android?
[00:05:17] <systemfault> someprimetime: I had to have one iphone and an android so I could find the one I prefer.
[00:05:33] <systemfault> I got an iphone for 3 years.. now I have a S3 for another 3 years.
[00:05:37] <systemfault> (Contract)
[00:05:39] <someprimetime> and which do you prefer?
[00:05:45] <someprimetime> iphone?
[00:05:49] <systemfault> For the phone itself, android.
[00:06:02] <systemfault> I find the inteface much more enjoyable to use.
[00:06:19] <someprimetime> wait really? that seems kinda unconventional
[00:06:28] <someprimetime> i'd expect someone to say the iphone phone > android
[00:06:29] <systemfault> As for the application ecosystem, google play is worth shit compared to the ios app store
[00:06:33] <djQuery> better hurry up and get it if you want to root it, it will be ilegal to do tomorrow
[00:06:46] <someprimetime> yeah the play store sucks
[00:06:54] <someprimetime> illegal to root my phone?
[00:06:58] <systemfault> In the US...
[00:07:05] <someprimetime> no fucking way?
[00:07:07] <systemfault> A new stupid law.
[00:07:20] <djQuery> yeppers, you gotta wait for your contract to expire
[00:07:26] <someprimetime> who is going to enforce it? the big bad FCC?
[00:07:43] <systemfault> I live in canada and I have a custom rom on my S3
[00:07:52] <systemfault> The good old Cyanogen mod
[00:07:53] <toothrot> citation needed
[00:07:56] <someprimetime> wait djquery what do you mean wait for your contract to expire?
[00:07:58] <someprimetime> yes please
[00:08:24] <systemfault> toothrot: that news was all over the intarw3bs
[00:08:43] <djQuery> if you get a $500 phone for 200 like in this example you get it cheap typically by signing a 2 year contract
[00:08:58] <djQuery> well for the next 2 years technicaly you dont own the phone
[00:09:36] <systemfault> I don't understand why it's like that...
[00:10:04] <djQuery> other countries peeps pay full price for phone and then get cheap contracts
[00:10:07] <someprimetime> oh that's bullshit
[00:10:10] <systemfault> I bought mine under contractâ€¦ but if I break it or if I resign my contract, I have to be the balance of the price on the phone
[00:10:12] <someprimetime> i'll just buy it through the google store
[00:10:55] <djQuery> systemfault, well in that case that you had paid the full price for the phone you can do what you want to it
[00:11:03] <someprimetime> whenever it comes back in stock
[00:11:54] <toothrot> i'm reading the exemption is still in place for phone
[00:12:05] <toothrot> it's tablets...
[00:12:14] <Jaycob> hey, I'm doing a "get" on an external HTML page (working on a chrome extension) and I get this error for some images: Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden)
[00:12:21] <Jaycob> can this be fixed
[00:12:27] <djQuery> like making payments on a car  buit after making 2 payments you paint it with a brush and roller some god awfull pink pegacorn on the side of it thus reducing the value of it
[00:12:46] <someprimetime> Jaycob: it means it's not allowing access to your request
[00:12:49] <toothrot> Jaycob, that's returned from the server
[00:13:08] <Jaycob> but can I somehow ignore it so it doesn't show up on the console
[00:13:09] <djQuery> yeah contact the owner of the server and ask them why they are denying your request
[00:13:12] <someprimetime> it's blocking it for some reason.. can you access it in your browser?
[00:13:33] <Jaycob> I just need the HTML which loads fine, this error I only get for images
[00:13:36] <someprimetime> i think that'll always be output to the console?
[00:14:06] <Jaycob> yes I can access it in my browser
[00:14:19] <someprimetime> djQuery: that's not even the same league though, painting a car !== rooting a phone
[00:14:29] <someprimetime> for 1, carriers don't re-sell used phones
[00:14:30] <Jaycob> (I'm loading and imdb result page, don't kill me)
[00:14:34] <Jaycob> and = an
[00:14:48] <someprimetime> Jaycob: pretty sure they'll be blocking your requests indefinitely
[00:14:52] <someprimetime> look @ their api
[00:14:57] <Jaycob> they dont have one
[00:15:11] <someprimetime> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1966503/does-imdb-provide-an-api
[00:15:17] <someprimetime> looks like they do but you need to use JSONP
[00:15:20] <someprimetime> which sucks
[00:15:36] <someprimetime> since JSONP sucks but I guess it'd work somewhat half-asses
[00:15:54] <someprimetime> sses/ssed
[00:16:12] <someprimetime> http://www.omdbapi.com/
[00:16:42] <someprimetime> in german: ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/
[00:16:45] <someprimetime> what a bunch of damn hoarders
[00:16:52] <Jaycob> someprimetime, but that doesn't work if I want to search for movies in my language
[00:17:09] <Jaycob> but no they are not blocking my requests
[00:17:13] <Jaycob> just images
[00:17:19] <someprimetime> write a translator ;)
[00:17:46] <Jaycob> I wrote one that used wikipedia to translate the movie title but that generated so many excess requests so I want to do it in a simpler way
[00:18:06] <toothrot> why are you requesting the images anyways
[00:18:16] <someprimetime> you could look into embedly to get the images for you
[00:18:30] <Jaycob> but I don't want the images
[00:18:36] <Jaycob> I just want rid of the error
[00:18:43] <someprimetime> i'm pretty sure it'll be there
[00:18:53] <Jaycob> ohkay
[00:19:21] <someprimetime> if a browser is going to complain i don't think there is a way for you to tell it "shh don't tell them about this error"
[00:19:35] <toothrot> Jaycob, http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/webRequest.html#event-onBeforeRequest
[00:19:52] <Jaycob> I thought if there were some way to fetch just html in the get request somehow
[00:19:57] <Jaycob> toothrot, thanks!
[00:20:21] <toothrot> note that i have no idea if there is a more straightforward way to avoid the image requests
[00:21:01] <someprimetime> toothrot: that's just for chrome though
[00:21:08] <Jaycob> it's and chrome extension
[00:21:12] <Jaycob> and = an !!!
[00:21:21] <Jaycob> an = a
[00:21:22] <Jaycob> lol
[00:21:23] <Jaycob> what
[00:21:34] <someprimetime> that's pretty much worthless
[00:21:42] <Jaycob> what is
[00:22:36] <dblosevn> only option would be to proxy the request and strip the image
[00:23:04] <toothrot> how are you making the GET request?
[00:23:38] <dblosevn> or if the error is in an image tag style it away with css
[00:23:53] <dblosevn> or some other selectable tag
[00:24:16] <Jaycob> $.get
[00:24:38] <dblosevn> ya but not for xdomain
[00:25:26] <toothrot> oh, i see, so you're displaying the html then?
[00:25:36] <Jaycob> no I'm not, parsing it
[00:25:55] <toothrot> why is it requesting images then?
[00:25:58] <Jaycob> I use $.parseHTML though, could that be a problem
[00:26:37] <Jaycob> that might be it
[00:26:51] <someprimetime> wait is this an error in the console?
[00:26:55] <Jaycob> yes
[00:27:48] <someprimetime> are you using .getJSON?
[00:28:14] <someprimetime> well first what type of data are you returning?
[00:28:15] <someprimetime> html?
[00:28:44] <Jaycob> I'm using .get and returning just a string
[00:28:57] <Jaycob> which I parse from the getted html
[00:29:04] <Jaycob> using .parseHTML
[00:29:37] <someprimetime> a string of what? html?
[00:30:15] <someprimetime> that must be terribly slow.
[00:30:22] <Jaycob> what
[00:30:28] <Jaycob> lemme jsfiddle this
[00:30:32] <someprimetime> sure
[00:32:31] <Jaycob> http://jsfiddle.net/M4KQU/
[00:32:34] <Jaycob> it don't work of course
[00:33:03] <Jaycob> cause it ain't allowed to make no request
[00:33:55] <someprimetime> ? jsonp @ Jaycob
[00:33:55] <bot-t> Jaycob, JSONP, Quickly Â« plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[00:34:33] <someprimetime> first i'd recommend pulling in some json though
[00:34:34] <Jaycob> it's a sin to use getJSON ?
[00:34:49] <someprimetime> because parsing HTML is sub-optimal
[00:34:50] <someprimetime> and slow
[00:34:57] <someprimetime> who said it's a sin?
[00:34:59] <Jaycob> yes, but so is every other option
[00:35:06] <Jaycob> I was just trying to understand
[00:35:12] <Jaycob> should I do it with ajax() ?
[00:35:37] <someprimetime> Jaycob: http://jsfiddle.net/M4KQU/1/
[00:35:43] <someprimetime> you want to do something like that
[00:36:04] <Jaycob> ok!
[00:36:09] <someprimetime> basically to get around CORS you use $.getJSON and append `&callback=?` to the end of your query string parameter
[00:36:21] <someprimetime> but seriously find out how you can grab JSON from imdb
[00:36:23] <someprimetime> and not html
[00:36:26] <Jaycob> thanks, will try that out
[00:36:31] <someprimetime> sure
[00:36:38] <Jaycob> I can't, I've really tried every api there is
[00:36:39] <Miki> hello anyone know how can disable right click in jquery 1.9.0?
[00:36:46] <Jaycob> because I need to search in my language
[00:37:11] <someprimetime> $('body').bind('contextmenu', function() { return false; }); @MichMich|work
[00:37:12] <someprimetime> woops
[00:37:16] <someprimetime> @Miki
[00:37:27] <someprimetime> what is your language?
[00:37:38] <Jaycob> finnish
[00:37:43] <Miki> thanks local?
[00:38:22] <someprimetime> Miki: actually use 'html' as your element
[00:38:24] <someprimetime> to bind to
[00:38:33] <someprimetime> why are you disabling right click anyway?
[00:38:33] <Miki> ah okey thanks
[00:38:40] <someprimetime> it's not going to stop people from right clicking you know :P
[00:38:45] <someprimetime> if they really want to they will
[00:38:56] <Miki> i just like :D
[00:39:02] <someprimetime> plus they could always go View > Source
[00:39:04] <someprimetime> ah ok
[00:42:09] <Jaycob> but thanks heaps for the help guys! I'm off to save the world
[00:47:23] <dblosevn> or spam click the right mouse in chrome/firefox and youll get the context menu anyways
[01:40:02] <S1kx> suggestions for a custom scrollbar plugin that supports non-fixed height elements (absolute top 0 bottom 0)? tried jscrollpane & slimscroll and neither work properly in this case
[01:54:38] <dblosevn> S1kx: forinstance the height of the end usesers window?
[01:55:35] <S1kx> dblosevn: yes, practically, its a sidebar inside a panel that's attached to the boundaries of the window, both with absolute positioning
[01:56:22] <dblosevn> dont see why that wouldnt work
[01:56:28] <S1kx> or actually, the outer one recalculates its height automatically i believe
[01:56:58] <dblosevn> that may cause issues, but most of the scroll plugins recalculate on resize
[02:02:33] <S1kx> ah cool, mcustomscrollbar works :)
[02:24:02] <Armistice> http://jsfiddle.net/vsgdZ/1/ I want to detect if a dom node was inserte on a specific element.
[02:24:17] <Armistice> This is a code that is said to work, I found it on stackoverflow I think.
[02:24:35] <Armistice> oh wait.
[02:24:37] <djQuery> ?newcontent@armistice
[02:24:37] <bot-t> armistice, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[02:25:21] <djQuery> Armistice, looks like it is working
[02:25:30] <Armistice> yeah it does a console.log
[02:25:56] <djQuery> Armistice, but I have seen issues with using domnodeinserted in ie
[02:26:39] <Armistice> it's weird. I'm trying to do a masonry thing with infinite scrolling in a tumblr theme. Both work, however the new content from the autoscroll is ignored.
[02:26:48] <Armistice> not autoscroll, infinite scroll
[02:26:56] <djQuery> I was able to use that newcontent plugin in a project where I wanted to apply some jquery ui to items as they were added
[02:27:27] <djQuery> know it worked with ie 9 but never got around testing it in older versions
[02:28:09] <Whirl3d_> djQuery, it has been years since I have seen you online.
[02:28:12] <Armistice> ill try newContent
[02:28:25] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, not that long
[02:28:40] <Whirl3d_> lol true, but a long long while. How have you been?
[02:28:53] <djQuery> Armistice, howver gnarf was on the other day saying that he needed to update it
[02:29:01] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, crappy
[02:29:11] <djQuery> spent last weekend in the poky
[02:29:16] <djQuery> damn tickets
[02:29:19] <Whirl3d_> sorry to hear that, why?
[02:29:25] <Whirl3d_> Parking Tickets?
[02:29:31] <djQuery> speeding
[02:29:44] <djQuery> $1033
[02:29:54] <Whirl3d_> At least it wasn't DUI.
[02:30:13] <djQuery> haent touched the stuff in 22 years
[02:30:28] <djQuery> quite drinking and pot on my 21st bday
[02:30:36] <djQuery> dont do the math
[02:30:51] <Whirl3d_> You are exactly my age. I thought you were a kid. LOL
[02:31:08] <djQuery> well brb need to finish this pull request before the page times out
[02:31:21] <Whirl3d_> cool.
[02:31:37] <djQuery> if I were still a kid I could probably get by the damn hr peeps
[02:32:22] <Armistice> does newContent prevent content being added ? When I use it, doesn't seem to add new items.
[02:32:41] <djQuery> Armistice, shouldnt
[02:32:55] <djQuery> It has prob been over a year since I looked at it though
[02:33:28] <porjo> I cannot seem to match <div id="content"></div> in my selector e.g. $('#content').length is always zero. Is 'content' some kind of reserved word?
[02:34:38] <djQuery> porjo, you dont have more than 1 do you?
[02:34:47] <djQuery> porjo, link?
[02:35:03] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, my first pull request
[02:35:16] <someprimetime> porjo: no it's not reserved
[02:35:32] <someprimetime> what happens when you do this console.log($('#content'));
[02:35:37] <someprimetime> how many nodes come back?
[02:36:14] <someprimetime> are you sure it's <div id="content" or did you accidentally write it <div class="content" instead?
[02:36:17] <someprimetime> double check the html
[02:36:44] <someprimetime> lastly, jshint your code to make sure that's not the only error
[02:36:47] <someprimetime> i'm going to sleep night all
[02:37:21] <djQuery> someprimetime, night
[02:38:43] <Armistice> This is my tumblr theme: http://pastecan.com/v/AlO9jLb the linesneeded to pay attention to, are 119 to 130.
[02:38:52] <porjo> djQuery: http://customtunedcars.tumblr.com/archive?before_time=1353008929 is an example of the HTML that I'm trying to parse with jQuery. There's only one '#content' that I can see
[02:39:00] <Armistice> Right now line 121-123 has the masonry. With this uncommented, my infinite scrolling does not work.
[02:39:09] <Armistice> With it commented, the infinite scrolling works.
[02:39:34] <Armistice> I'm new to tumblr so ... i dunno.
[02:39:41] <Armistice> the masonry works on it's own, infinite scrolling works on its own.
[02:39:44] <Armistice> but never together.
[02:41:07] <djQuery> sory line 121 of what
[02:41:22] <djQuery> chrome dont give me line #s
[02:41:38] <Armistice> Do you have javascript enabled? ;P
[02:42:47] <djQuery> Armistice, nopers I just like hanging out in a javascript irc
[02:42:50] <djQuery> lol
[02:43:29] <Armistice> http://pastebin.com/UiKvn5JB not sure if this will show line numbers then.
[02:43:57] <djQuery> <!--[if lte IE 6]>  window.location = http://google.com/chrome
[02:44:20] <Armistice> huh
[02:45:22] <djQuery> Armistice, nutn
[02:45:25] <Armistice> do line numbers appear on the pastebin link?
[02:45:33] <djQuery> just every time I see those IE hacks in a page
[02:46:07] <djQuery> especialy ie 6 feel like redirecting them to google chrome download page
[02:46:18] <Armistice> who's using that?
[02:46:21] <djQuery> Armistice, yes
[02:46:25] <djQuery> Armistice, you are
[02:46:40] <Armistice> on my paste? o.o
[02:47:06] <djQuery> dont see it in the paste but saw it in the page
[02:47:17] <Armistice> What page? I'm highly confused.
[02:47:49] <djQuery> Armistice, oh well lets get back to the issue not my highly sleep deprived sense of humor
[02:48:00] <djQuery> Armistice, you arent using newcontent right
[02:48:09] <djQuery> ?newcontent
[02:48:10] <bot-t> jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[02:48:16] <Armistice> I am ...
[02:48:53] <Armistice> it's commented out because ... lets explain. In the paste (either pastecan or pastebin whichever) lines 121-123 if uncommented, masonry will work but no new content will be added by the infinite scrolling.
[02:49:21] <Armistice> If lines 121 to 129 are commented out, infinite scrolling will work.
[02:49:27] <Armistice> but no masonry, obviously.
[02:50:50] <Armistice> If lines 125 to 129 are uncommented, it seems to collapse everything... again, masonry will work ... but no new content is added.
[02:50:59] <Armistice> is seems as if there is some form of collision between the two but I haven't a damn clue what.
[02:51:03] <Armistice> It's confusing me.
[02:52:18] <djQuery> Armistice, well I am sorry but it is 5 am hear and I have to hit the junk yard before work tomorrow
[02:52:25] <djQuery> I gotta hit the hay
[02:53:54] <Armistice> The idea is that (for everyone except djQuery who's ditching me for his stack of hay) with lines 121 to 129 commented... infinite scrolling works. Images are stacked ... rowly I guess. I want toa dd in masonry at the same time. It is failing to ... well, work.
[02:54:06] <Armistice> but er... im hella confused.
[02:59:45] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone. is there a good way to expand a div with toggle but not the children inside that div?
[03:00:29] <jarr0dsz> i have this div #expand with another div #content inside it and need to be able to click the #content div without the toggle for #expand is trigerered

[03:03:51] <jarr0dsz> okay thanks djQuery i look into that
[03:04:02] <Armistice> djQuery go to bed. ;P
[03:04:23] <djQuery> had to close out some tabs first
[03:04:27] <djQuery> down to 20 now

[03:05:57] <djQuery> errr oops http://jsbin.com/ukixuc/7/edit
[03:06:04] <Trudko> I know how to do 360 view but problem is with customnization
[03:06:07] <jarr0dsz> djQuery: it works fine but it does throw an error ReferenceError: event is not defined
[03:06:36] <djQuery> jarr0dsz, well yeah any time there is an error all javascript stops
[03:07:11] <djQuery> in the annon function that you are passing to the click you need to add the parameter event
[03:07:29] <jarr0dsz> using something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/uzhmC/
[03:07:36] <jarr0dsz> djQuery: so that error is normal?
[03:07:45] <djQuery> err no
[03:08:03] <djQuery> jarr0dsz, http://jsfiddle.net/uzhmC/1/
[03:08:41] <djQuery> jarr0dsz, and by the way live is going away

[03:08:50] <jarr0dsz> ah right you have to pass the (event) in there ! thank you im not that  off a jquery guru
[03:09:36] <djQuery> jarr0dsz, all it means is that I have made the same mistakes but remember the answer when I asked in here
[03:09:46] <djQuery> I have only been doing this for 30 hours
[03:10:13] <jarr0dsz> its not that hard no but normally don't spend 30 hours doing jquery ;) far less
[03:10:30] <jarr0dsz> hmm it seems now the child div still collapses it was the error that made it work "stop execution"

[03:43:27] <Cahnory> Hello everyone !
[03:54:03] <noregret> I was on jquery-ui 1.9 and using the tooltip, now when i put a '<br>' in the string of the title, the tooltip showed it as a new line.. but after updating to jquery-ui 1.10, the <br> now is displayed as is in teh tooltip.. any idea what the cause might be ? is there a new way for this in 1.10 ?
[03:56:42] <Armistice> I cannot get it to work so I'm going to work on my own Masonry. http://pastebin.com/VJh6SGxq The problem I have is in relation to newContent
[03:56:55] <Armistice> the infinite scroll does indeed add new content to the #itemContainer div.
[03:57:16] <Armistice> but
[03:57:23] <Armistice> newContent doesn't detect it.
[03:57:55] <Armistice> uppose to throw an alert but ... nothing is thrown. o.o
[03:57:57] <Armistice> Any ideas?
[03:59:52] <Trudko> Guys I am trying to do product viewer in javascript something like here http://store.nike.com/fr/fr_fr/product/free-run-id-running-shoe/builder/?debug=true
[04:00:15] <Trudko> I know how to do 360 view but problem is with customization of item I need to change some colors of certain parts
[04:05:56] <Armistice> please someone help me with newContent ;(
[04:09:34] <superdmp> is it possible to get hold of an element - say an iframe, or an img - and render it in a pop-up window of some sort without having to reload the item?
[04:10:03] <superdmp> or does re-rendering an item imply reloading?
[04:11:02] <Cahnory> superdmp: All tests I have done make me answer no. But I'm not an expert ;)
[04:11:26] <Cahnory> no to the first question
[04:12:56] <superdmp> Cahnory:  thanks - I am asking because i'd like to put an embedded YouTube video in an iframe, that opens up in a lightbox-style popup window when clicked
[04:13:12] <superdmp> but I don't want to be loading the video iframe *twice*
[04:13:20] <superdmp> which seems wasteful of bandwidth
[04:15:49] <Cahnory> I'm working on a client side html email cleaner. I use an iframe to load the mail and manipulate it. I tried to move the iframe elsewhere in the dom but it causing reload and all changes applied where removed. Maybe there is a solution but I didn't found it.
[04:16:11] <Cahnory> So as I say maybe I don't have the answer but I didn't found a way.
[04:19:34] <superdmp> ok, thanks
[04:49:25] <AsaC_> Hi, anyone about?
[04:50:53] <nullslash> Hi, how do I register a new element with DOM?
[04:51:56] <AsaC_> I'm trying to attach a bootstrap modal (ajax response) to the DOM with the 'show' event but its not working .. $('#widget-modal').on('show', '#content-inner', function(e){ ....
[05:04:53] <MrFox> in my country usual date format is dd.mm.yyyy. i noticed youtube displays dates within titles of some videos in this format even though they were uploaded by american. how does youtube 'know' how to adjust date format?
[05:22:02] <Trudko> Guys I am trying to do product viewer in javascript something like here http://store.nike.com/fr/fr_fr/product/free-run-id-running-shoe/builder/?debug=true
[05:22:04] <Trudko> I know how to do 360 view but problem is with customization of item I need to change some colors of certain parts
[05:22:06] <Trudko> Not sure if its possible to change 360 direclty, I need to change colors  , add some texts...
[05:34:28] <Danny_B> i have a list of <a>'s all pointing to some id's (<li><a href="#foo">foo</a></li> etc.) those id'ed elements are always <div id="foo"><strong>lorem</strong> ipsum</div>
[05:35:06] <Danny_B> first what i'm trying to do, is a content of id'ed element for every <a> in the list of links
[05:35:45] <Danny_B> (within a callback:)  $text = $( $( $( this ).attr( 'href' ) ).html() );
[05:36:20] <Danny_B> works but looks quite weird to me - is that correct or is there anything more effective?
[05:36:54] <Danny_B> second step - i'm trying to return that content *without* the <strong> element
[05:37:44] <Danny_B> in any way i use .remove() i always get the <strong> itself instead of the rest of the content which is what i need
[05:37:54] <shoky> Danny_B: first of all, id's should be unique, you dont want two divs with id=foo
[05:38:10] <shoky> Danny_B: 2nd, jquery has .clone()
[05:38:11] <Danny_B> shoky: i know, that's why i wrote etc ;-)
[05:38:19] <Danny_B> clone clones with wrapper
[05:38:32] <shoky> wat?
[05:38:55] <Danny_B> if i clone li#foo i will get <li>
[05:39:01] <Danny_B> i need just the inner content
[05:39:07] <Danny_B> plus it creates the duplicate id
[05:39:10] <Danny_B> via clone
[05:40:33] <shoky> ok. best thing to do is put that " ipsum" in a span
[05:41:06] <Danny_B> let me rephrase: as a callback on click on every <a> in the list, i want to alert the *content* of the element it points to *without* selected thing to be not displayed
[05:41:12] <Danny_B> shoky: can't change html
[05:44:59] <Armistice> I'm trying to detect if the bottomof scroll was reached: http://jsfiddle.net/A6wY4/1/ strangely enough, it doesn't even detect the scrollbar has moved. What am I doing wrong?
[05:53:32] <Whirl3d_> Armistice, have you looked at the scrollTo plugin. Scrolling is such a racket that I rely on it almost every time I have scrolling content. It's old, but works great.
[05:55:54] <Whirl3d_> and first things first. You are using the onLoad handler which means your script will fire before your elements are setup. That's not gonna work.
[05:56:42] <Whirl3d_> and because you have no content in your div that you want to create scrolling, there's no scroll method or reason to scroll
[05:57:13] <StephenS> how can I make a new tab on my jquery chat which works with ajax and php?
[05:57:27] <StephenS> storing data in mysql and thn pulling data from it
[05:57:33] <StephenS> but that works only for single normal connection
[05:57:54] <booom> hi dudes
[05:57:57] <StephenS> when new user come I see his session and see his not chatting with person recently, and open new tab on chat textarea
[05:58:00] <StephenS> how to do that?
[05:58:00] <booom> how do you concatenate this ? http://pastebin.com/7bwjyXvs
[05:58:21] <booom> i would like to use 1 animate() for 1 element is it possible to merge these into 1?
[05:58:24] <foofoobar> Hi. I have an array which I got from filepicker.io. I now want to send the data I got back via an input-hidden field. the data looks like: {"data": [{"url": "https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/...", "data": {"size": 6065, "type": "image/png", "key": "â€¦.png", "filename": "....png"}}], "result": "ok"}
[05:58:35] <foofoobar> How should I "encode" this to put it in the input hidden field
[05:58:46] <foofoobar> I used JSON.stringify() but that does not work correct
[06:00:56] <jost> booom, you could execute the second animation in the "complete"-callback of the first animation
[06:01:18] <booom> how can you show me pls?
[06:01:40] <StephenS> jost what about me?
[06:01:48] <jost> or eave your code as is. jQuery chains animations
[06:02:51] <booom> @jost ok thanks man
[06:03:04] <StephenS> boom boom pow
[06:03:35] <booom> :D
[06:03:48] <booom> but â€¦ if i have do_this_method();
[06:03:56] <booom> i launch that, how to stop it?
[06:04:01] <booom> to kill i mean
[06:04:06] <booom> kill a method
[06:04:11] <booom> kill that damn of method
[06:04:13] <booom> :D
[06:05:00] <StephenS> jost how aboyut m
[06:05:01] <StephenS> e
[06:05:37] <booom> @StephenS #javascript
[06:05:40] <booom> :D
[06:06:14] <Armistice> if you have a string containing a lump of html, how would you get the content from a specific element?
[06:06:27] <Armistice> so lets say I have a whole html page in a string, and i wanna get the content of #bar
[06:06:43] <Armistice> $(data).find("#bar").html() :
[06:06:44] <Armistice> ?
[06:06:47] <booom> $("#bar").html();
[06:07:01] <booom> you get #bar content
[06:07:07] <jost> Armistice, yes, or .text(), or whatever you need
[06:07:15] <booom> $("#bar").text();
[06:07:20] <booom> you get #bar only text
[06:07:22] <Armistice> the element #bar would be inside a string (var data = "loads of html";)
[06:07:44] <booom> should work
[06:07:46] <Armistice> ok
[06:09:10] <DansVC> oi
[06:09:18] <DansVC> hi, sry
[06:09:28] <DansVC> someone is here?

[06:13:27] <StephenS> $("#iFrame").contents().find("#someDiv").removeClass("hidden");
[06:13:45] <StephenS> or on click button $("#button").click(function () {
[06:13:45] <StephenS>       $("#frame").attr("src", "http://www.google.com/");
[06:13:45] <StephenS> });
[06:13:59] <StephenS> You do not need tags
[06:14:11] <StephenS> for jquery, just assign id for tag in html
[06:14:12] <DansVC> ok
[06:15:13] <StephenS> I wish someone can help me :(
[06:16:14] <DansVC> what is the problem
[06:16:26] <DansVC> I'm not pro but i will try it
[06:18:05] <StephenS> ah its complicated :D
[06:18:36] <StephenS> how can I make a new tab on my jquery chat which works with ajax and php?
[06:18:38] <StephenS> that ^^
[06:20:42] <DansVC> I never work with php and ajax
[06:21:18] <Whirl3d_> I still find it hard to believe that jsfiddle doesn't catch endless loops or memory leaks and cancel itself rather than locking up the browser.
[06:22:58] <Whirl3d_> StephenS, can you be more specific?
[06:23:35] <DansVC> have a space between the name and the speack?
[06:24:28] <StephenS> Whirl3d_, Yes
[06:24:47] <StephenS> I have one textarea which works as chat, and when someone else enters the link, they all enter in textarea as persons, like irc chat room
[06:25:04] <StephenS> you have persons on side, but i want instead of that, whoever enters chat to be opened new tab for that main client.
[06:25:21] <StephenS> lets say you are client, and your profile visits 5 people, you need to have 5 opened tabs separatelly, not all in one
[06:25:26] <Whirl3d_> are you using sockets?
[06:26:23] <Whirl3d_> or webworkers or something? How are you updating the textarea on each client in the chat?
[06:31:03] <Whirl3d_> hello?
[06:33:52] <StephenS> Whirl3d_, with ajax
[06:33:59] <StephenS> Whirl3d_, 1st thought was to use socket.io under node server
[06:34:08] <StephenS> but then I quit from that, lack of documention..
[06:34:48] <kreature> when using the new jQuery mobile 1.3 beta I get an error message 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'trigger' of undefined' when using the autoInitializePage=false setting

[06:35:19] <kreature> can anyone help me?
[06:37:42] <grass7boy_> hello... i ve found that some mobile device has no acceleration attribute in motion event
[06:37:53] <grass7boy_> however, they all have the accelerationIncludingGravity attribute
[06:37:56] <grass7boy_> is there any mathematical relation between  accelerationIncludingGravity and acceleration ??
[06:38:52] <StephenS> Whirl3d_, what to do?
[06:41:44] <kreature> I've got a demo page of the error here: http://jsbin.com/idisoq/1/
[06:41:57] <kreature> this produces the error I'm talking about

[08:05:10] <otherj> doesn't this, rather
[08:17:16] <drvanon> Hello, I am making a request to another site with jquery, but I just found out that other site does not allow ajax request. Is there another way of getting the page? (I only need it's text content)
[08:21:11] <seich-> you could try something like: http://www.corsproxy.com/
[08:33:06] <hashpuppy> i have an on click event on document.  how can i tell whether or not something that on click event happened within ".some-div".  i don't want the actions to occur when this happens.
[08:35:42] <hashpuppy> nm, i got it
[08:36:16] <hashpuppy> but is there a case when event won't exist within the on click event?

[08:48:16] <GeorgeJ> Hello folks!
[08:48:32] * rmill waves
[08:48:42] <b-ot> hi hi hi
[08:48:45] <GeorgeJ> Should $.post(url, myObj, callback, 'json') not send a json body in the POST?
[08:49:52] <GeorgeJ> a json in the POST body*
[08:50:56] <GeorgeJ> Or, should I actually be doing $.post(url, JSON.stringify(myObj), callback, 'json') ?
[08:53:35] <rmill> GeorgeJ: There's an example of sending .post to a server here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/#example-6
[08:53:38] <noregret> GeorgeJ: that 4th param is the type of data expected from teh server
[08:53:52] <noregret> not the type of data you send
[08:54:02] * rmill nods
[08:54:22] <rmill> In that example you see: `<?php echo json_encode(array("name"=>"John","time"=>"2pm")); ?>`
[08:54:30] <GeorgeJ> Erm. Wat.
[08:54:46] <GeorgeJ> How does the browser know what data the server expects?
[08:55:09] <GeorgeJ> AFAIK, the request headers tell the server what kind of data is being sent.
[08:55:29] <GeorgeJ> The server can only choose to accept the said type of data or not.
[08:56:04] <otherj> can someone help me DRY this so i can use it with a class rather than an id? the part I'm not sure about is how i DRY $('#addshipmentsbutton i') when i'll have multiple .thing i on the page    https://gist.github.com/77f9a9ffb9fb871a7ff6
[08:56:33] <GeorgeJ> Oh
[08:56:42] <GeorgeJ> Perhaps you mean the type of data the server RETURNS.
[08:56:57] <GeorgeJ> Oh, my bad, I've read what you sai wrong.
[08:57:05] <rmill> GeorgeJ: :)
[08:59:27] <rmill> GeorgeJ, you can just send a regular obj to the server: $.post("test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[09:00:35] <GeorgeJ> I know, but the request body would just be an urlencoded string of the values.
[09:00:53] <GeorgeJ> I want to send a json body, so I can unmarshall it better.
[09:01:59] <jrockjiggz2> hacky, but you can also $.load('test.php?' + $(this).serialize()); //not recommended
[09:02:21] <GeorgeJ> JSON.stringify works just fine.
[09:08:17] <otherj> ugh, can't figure out how to do this
[09:08:36] <toothrot> give up
[09:08:49] <otherj> get banned.
[09:09:08] <toothrot> what are you trying to do?
[09:09:30] <otherj> DRY up this js so i can use it on multiple items with a class https://gist.github.com/77f9a9ffb9fb871a7ff6
[09:09:50] <otherj> the sticking point is making it select the right <i>
[09:12:16] <GeorgeJ> otherj: https://gist.github.com/0ee031e55cf9fefc549f
[09:13:30] <GeorgeJ> otherj: https://gist.github.com/0ee031e55cf9fefc549f perhaps even better
[09:13:42] <otherj> GeorgeJ: thanks and I see what you're doing, but I don't think that puts the fadetoggle on the right dive?
[09:14:22] <otherj> the html for this is basically <a href="â€¦" id="addshipmentsbutton"><i class="icon"></i>stuff</a><div id="addshipmentsform">...</div>
[09:14:37] <GeorgeJ> otherj: Check the latest update, again.
[09:14:41] <otherj> looking
[09:14:50] <GeorgeJ> oops
[09:14:57] <otherj> ok, but that fade toggles the button
[09:15:06] <otherj> see what i mean?
[09:15:17] <otherj> might be i need to wrap it all in a div and rteference it that way
[09:15:24] <otherj> ugh
[09:15:31] <otherj> at least then i could do like $(this) .thing
[09:15:33] <GeorgeJ> I've no ideea what you're trying to do.
[09:15:38] <GeorgeJ> jsfiddle it
[09:15:40] <otherj> k
[09:16:18] <otherj> http://jsfiddle.net/4ejRM/
[09:16:24] <otherj> obviously this won't work as is
[09:16:28] <otherj> but gives you an idea of the structure
[09:17:02] <otherj> right now i can do this by repeating the JS a bunch of times and referencing the element's id
[09:17:07] <otherj> but i'd prefer to DRY the js
[09:17:47] <otherj> I guess i could just iterate through ids too, but it seems like the best way is to use a class and have it work for all
[09:19:33] <GeorgeJ> You should wrap the button and the form in a div
[09:19:41] <otherj> yeah, thought so :P
[09:19:42] <toothrot> i'd rearrange the html so you can just use sibling/next
[09:19:47] <otherj> let me try re-writing it
[09:19:51] <otherj> and then i'll ask again
[09:20:00] <GeorgeJ> What toothrot sai
[09:20:01] <GeorgeJ> d
[09:20:57] <toothrot> (or parent())
[09:23:02] * otherj attempts this
[09:31:41] <otherj> I guess I can't do $(this).next('.someclass') if the click function isn't also a div?
[09:31:47] <toothrot> otherj, simple modified example: http://jsfiddle.net/rDf6W/
[09:32:04] <toothrot> also, i would probably not swap the icon class at the end of the animation
[09:32:41] <otherj> hm
[09:32:46] <otherj> just don't like the way it looks?
[09:33:07] <toothrot> yeah, just a matter of taste about the delay i guess
[09:33:31] <otherj> toothrot, why do you set $this to $(this)? can you not just use $(this) in the functioin?
[09:34:01] <toothrot> because at that point this points to $target's element
[09:34:07] <otherj> oooh, right
[09:34:24] <otherj> ok, thanks for writing this. I think that's why my .next wasn't working
[09:39:36] <kaichanvong___> toothrot: why not just use toggleClass once?
[09:40:31] <kaichanvong___> Oh because of bootstrap ^_^
[09:46:13] <otherj> toothrot: just wanted to let you know that i learned something from your example. thanks.
[09:47:11] * BinaryKitten gives toothrot more cookies
[09:47:21] <otherj> put some extra sugar on those cookies
[09:53:43] <peterschmidler> I'V got a div containing an image and a div. How to call that first div inside the div?
[09:54:30] <peterschmidler> $(".mydiv").find("div").eq(0) ?
[09:55:49] <BinaryKitten> that would work
[09:56:05] <BinaryKitten> if there is only 1 div peterschmidler then the .eq(o) is not really worth it
[09:56:11] <BinaryKitten> eq(0) even
[09:57:18] <toothrot> if you're going to go with that you could just roll it into one selctor
[09:57:36] <BinaryKitten> toothrot you could, but there is no benefit really
[09:59:46] <BinaryKitten> toothrot did you know that sizzle is right to left processing with selectors?
[10:01:19] <toothrot> ah.. i do remember seeing a post about children/find being preferable now that you mention that
[10:01:29] <BinaryKitten> http://jsperf.com/jquery-selector-perf-right-to-left
[10:02:07] <BinaryKitten> basically if peterschmidler di $('.mydiv div') it would find all divs. then filter those to ones that have parents with the class mydiv
[10:02:26] <toothrot> yeah, that's my mistake. bad idea.
[10:02:31] <peterschmidler> BinaryKitten: Thanks! Remocing the eq(0) did it...
[10:03:03] <toothrot> $("div", ".mydiv") would be better though, right?
[10:03:14] <BinaryKitten> toothrot not really either
[10:03:29] <toothrot> same problem?
[10:03:31] <BinaryKitten> that's just shorthand for $('.mydiv').children('div')
[10:03:57] <BinaryKitten> plus it's ambiguous
[10:04:18] <BinaryKitten> the only reason i use that particular syntax is when the target i'm looking in can change
[10:05:06] <BinaryKitten> anyway.. time for me to head out into the snow
[10:05:18] <toothrot> actually i editted that jsperf and $('p', '#box'); ended up being the fastest here on win7/firefox
[10:05:35] <toothrot> but you're right
[10:05:40] <toothrot> it's not the same thing
[10:08:24] <HankHendrix> stop() func doesn't seem to work properly when used with click on my slideshow??? ---> http://jsfiddle.net/WeuNd/8/
[10:08:52] <HankHendrix> I'd be very grateful for any comments on why the click is screwing the animation
[10:09:51] <BinaryKitten> toothrot running revision 104 and still getting same results
[10:10:14] <BinaryKitten> toothrot can you run this http://jsperf.com/jquery-selector-perf-right-to-left/104
[10:10:57] <BinaryKitten> HankHendrix how do you mean "screwing"
[10:11:03] <BinaryKitten> stop seems to stop it fine
[10:11:06] <HankHendrix> @BinaryKitten: Hey Binary, I didn't know you ventured into JS! I thought  you were just PHP and Zend?
[10:11:12] <BinaryKitten> but the mousleave starts it again
[10:11:30] <BinaryKitten> HankHendrix heh
[10:11:45] <HankHendrix> @Binary: yeh, but it's as if the sequence doesn't get cleared properly with the stop()
[10:11:49] <BinaryKitten> HankHendrix JS is my playground. Php provides my food
[10:12:07] <BinaryKitten> HankHendrix stop doesn't clear
[10:12:08] <HankHendrix> @BinaryKitten: they seem to stack up and just go haywire after clicking on "001" etc
[10:12:12] <DansVC> hi
[10:12:34] <HankHendrix> @BinaryKitten: sorry, I should have said the problem lies not with the hover/out but with clicking the image links "001, 002, 003"
[10:13:02] <DansVC> what is the problem?
[10:13:09] <HankHendrix> http://jsfiddle.net/WeuNd/8/
[10:13:51] <DansVC> cool
[10:13:53] <HankHendrix> @DansVC: Clicking on another slide in the sequence (via 001, 002 etc) seems to make the transitioning of the slides and seqeuncing a bit screwey
[10:14:11] <HankHendrix> *wish I could just use CSS3 transitions!*
[10:14:31] <toothrot> .find is the fastest, so something must've interferred previously.
[10:14:36] <BinaryKitten> HankHendrix i'd love to be able to diagnose. but unfortunately i'm late
[10:14:41] <BinaryKitten> have to head out into the snow
[10:15:07] <toothrot> (or that was accidentally the one i edited, doh)
[10:15:17] <DansVC> very good, but i dont understand qhat is the problem?
[10:15:42] <HankHendrix> @BinaryKitten: No worries! hope to see you at PHPNW sometime soon
[10:16:27] <BinaryKitten> HankHendrix Tuesday 5th Feb?
[10:16:40] <HankHendrix> @DansVC: Don't you experience screwey sequencing when using the navigational links?
[10:16:55] <HankHendrix> @BinaryKitten: What's the topic?
[10:17:11] <BinaryKitten> no clue. check the irc channel/facebook group/google+ group
[10:18:23] <DansVC> some one helps me?
[10:19:49] <peterschmidler> There is no callback function for css(), right? Is there another way to find out when the CSS change has completed?
[10:20:34] <HankHendrix> don't think so with the CSS
[10:20:45] <HankHendrix> I could use animate() which has a callback
[10:20:53] <DansVC> I try but I cannot crate a Iframe
[10:21:17] <toothrot> .css() is async? that is surprising to me.
[10:21:22] <HankHendrix> but I can only change opacity with animate
[10:21:34] <HankHendrix> which doesn't set the element to display:none
[10:21:50] <toothrot> that doesn't sound right anyhow
[10:22:16] <HankHendrix> css() doesn't have a callback
[10:22:41] <toothrot> why would it?
[10:22:58] <HankHendrix> agreed
[10:23:56] <toothrot> it's synchronous
[10:24:00] <HankHendrix> I think the problem is that when a navigational link is clicked it doesn't "clear" the existing animation, like a clearInterval() would do
[10:24:34] <toothrot> peterschmidler, what are you trying to do?
[10:24:53] <DansVC> who?
[10:25:02] <DansVC> sry it's a test
[10:26:12] <HankHendrix> @peterschmidler: just perform an if statement on css('style')
[10:28:16] <peterschmidler> toothrot: Removing a video and showing an image that has been hidden with visibility: 'hidden', display: 'block' (to stay able to access dimensions). When I remove() the video and show the image, on iPad (which is slow) the image disappears immediately but the image appears only after a while. I would like to remove the video only after the image is shown... Understand?
[10:29:17] <peterschmidler> HankHendrix: I want to do it in any case. I need some async function to hide the video when the image is displayed...
[10:32:06] <DansVC> someone help me with iframe?
[10:54:25] <nebmo> hi, why is this not cloning the first row? http://jsfiddle.net/NCM7A/7/
[10:55:27] <squidnips> I'm sure this is simple, but I'm trying to select the first image contained in the first visible div in a container I specify, but I keep getting null returned. How's this code look?
[10:55:30] <squidnips> current_img = $('.selector > div').filter(':visible').filter('img:first-child');
[10:56:41] <tfitts> squidnips: you need to select children at some point, otherwise you're only working with that div
[10:57:01] <Whirl3d_> nebmo, you call the function before it's defined
[10:58:00] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/NCM7A/8/
[11:00:52] <nebmo> Whirl3d_: im not sure that makes a diff. It is meant to copy the 1st row of tbody.
[11:01:04] <Whirl3d_> That was just the first problem.
[11:01:11] <nebmo> oh :)
[11:01:34] <Whirl3d_> do you always want to copy the first row?
[11:01:47] <nebmo> yeh
[11:02:46] <nebmo> suppose it doesnt matter which row, as long as when it copies that the fields are blank after.
[11:04:14] <squidnips> tfitts thanks, ended up with this: current_img = $('.selector > div:visible').children('img').filter(':first');
[11:05:01] <squidnips> or rather, this: current_img = $('.selector > div:visible img').filter(':first');
[11:12:44] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/NCM7A/12/
[11:12:51] <Whirl3d_> nebmo
[11:15:11] <nebmo> Whirl3d_: ahh was quite close! when i did alert on 'table' it said it was an object and when i removed it it duplicated the row but not fields.
[11:15:14] <nebmo> thank you
[11:20:15] <StephenS> how can I check extension inside pic to see if is jpg and such on preview?
[11:20:40] <Whirl3d_> np. Here is the latest version. It needs tweaking...http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/NCM7A/13/
[11:21:04] <Whirl3d_> but it is supposed to validate that the last row does not have any blanks before adding a row
[11:21:59] <Whirl3d_> StephenS, use regex or String on the src attr?
[11:22:07] <Whirl3d_> *String methods.
[11:22:49] <Whirl3d_> nebmo, wheever you alert a jquery object it will come back as an object.
[11:24:25] <dersand> http://pastebin.com/ZkScPdZt
[11:31:01] <iman> It's not good, there aren't OR to detect function, something like this ("button[name=foo] OR button[name=bar]").click(function(event) {
[11:31:37] <Woet> what would be the best plugin(s) to create a combination of infinite scroll and a table sorter?
[11:31:54] <iman> to implement something like that, I have to create a function
[11:32:29] <dersand> help me please: http://pastebin.com/ZkScPdZt
[11:33:56] <Woet> dersand: http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/global_variable
[11:34:32] <Woet> also, what is the point of "change == true && !change == false" ?
[11:34:48] <Woet> and when do you expect it to get into the else?
[11:35:14] <dersand> else is just fot debugging atm
[11:35:27] <Whirl3d_> iman, say what?
[11:35:37] <Woet> dersand: okay, but it can never get there.
[11:35:54] <Woet> dersand: finally, you are saying "change = true" and immediately after "if change is true do this"
[11:36:06] <Woet> so that will always trigger.
[11:37:14] <dersand> so if the change goes through the first if, does not the change = false?
[11:37:43] <Woet> dersand: yes, and then the next time that function is triggered you change it to true again
[11:37:45] <Whirl3d_> $("#testbtn").on("click", function (e) {e.preventDefault(); if ($(this).is(".toggleOn")) {$(this).removeClass("toggleOn"); return;}$(this).addClass("toggleOn");}));
[11:38:09] <Whirl3d_> without using jqueryUI toggle class
[11:38:52] <Whirl3d_> and use jsfiddle for tests like this. That way you can try the shizit out
[11:39:41] <dersand> i dont really get it, why wont the variable change?
[11:39:50] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, didnt know toggleClass was a part of ui and not of core
[11:41:19] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/v6Efy/
[11:42:25] <Whirl3d_> is it just the animate toggle that's part of jqueryUI?
[11:42:47] <djQuery> dunnno but that can be coool
[11:42:58] <dersand> @woet  i dont really get it, why wont the variable change?
[11:43:02] <djQuery> landed my 1st bug fix last night
[11:43:04] <Whirl3d_> dersand, every time you click the button the first thing you do is set the variable =true....it's always gonna be true then
[11:43:09] <Woet> dersand: because you define it before the if.
[11:43:11] <djQuery> tiny thing but still
[11:43:27] <Woet> dersand: you really should read some basic javascript (or programming for that matter) tutorials
[11:43:36] <Woet> this is basic variables/if/else stuff
[11:44:12] <Whirl3d_> if you set the variable up outside of the click handler, and don't set the variable = true until you check it, it would work (ugly but it would work)
[11:45:03] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, of just store the var as a propertry of the element being interacted with like you did
[11:46:26] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/v6Efy/1/
[11:47:19] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, that just makes me feel nasty and not in the good way
[11:47:37] <Whirl3d_> dersand that is kind of like what you were doing, but it defines the variable outside of the click handler. The better way to do it is to store the button state in the object somehow (like in the text of the button) and check it
[11:48:32] <djQuery> dersand, the way that Whirl3d_ just demo'd I would be very difficult to save the state of more than 1 button as well
[11:48:34] <dersand> like checking the value or something? and then manipulating it by jquery?
[11:48:52] <Whirl3d_> dersand, what happens is the local variables you define in the function get cleared and created every time you run the function.
[11:49:17] <Whirl3d_> dersand, you can use the DATA property if you want
[11:49:53] <dersand> It worked by setting it from the local to global like you said
[11:50:02] <dersand> Thanks, i'm new to scripting
[11:51:21] <djQuery> dersand, Whirl3d_, look at the last example here http://jsfiddle.net/v6Efy/2/
[11:51:49] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/v6Efy/3/ here is an example using the data property.
[11:51:50] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, evidently toggleClass is not a part of ui
[11:52:32] <Whirl3d_> When you mentioned it, I looked it up. I guess I was thinking slideToggle maybe...not sure.
[11:52:36] <dersand> Not sure what toggleClass is but does it like switch between classes?
[11:52:56] <Whirl3d_> ding ding ding on to the bonus round....
[11:53:20] <djQuery> dersand, just does what Whirl3d_ has been doing manualy
[11:53:47] <Whirl3d_> or at least part of it.
[11:53:57] <djQuery> get the item in question, check to see if it has the class specified, if it does remove it, if not add it
[11:54:02] <Whirl3d_> It doesn't change the text, just adds/removes a class
[11:54:36] <Whirl3d_> But lately, I have been adding two spans to my elements and toggling the class hides one or the other.
[11:54:49] <Whirl3d_> or I do the sprite thing.
[11:56:02] <djQuery> is this all we have today?
[11:58:52] <Whirl3d_> You could give me some advice about how I can approach a weird topic if you wanted...
[12:00:17] <StephenS> What is wrong with my code http://jsfiddle.net/czYTe/
[12:00:19] <djQuery> this is odd http://jsbin.com/ukixuc/9/edit   setting the width of the window to 100% seems to work but setting the hieght doesnt
[12:00:24] <StephenS> On count.php?get=info I have 0 as output and I dont get auto updated in that div on my page info, why?
[12:02:31] <djQuery> did you remember to poor the blood of a chicken over your server this month?
[12:03:27] <Whirl3d_> oooh, I did, I did, and I gotta say things have been much nicer since...
[12:04:00] <StephenS> can someone help me please?
[12:04:48] <dersand> fadeIn("slow")
[12:04:54] <dersand> how much time is that ?
[12:05:24] <Whirl3d_> .c fadeIn
[12:05:32] <Whirl3d_> wrong bot. LOL
[12:05:38] <Whirl3d_> ? .fadeIn
[12:05:39] <bot-t> .fadeIn([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements by fading them to opaque. http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[12:06:35] <dersand> is it possible to do function ( code //a delay more code)?
[12:07:09] <Whirl3d_> ? .delay @ dersand
[12:07:09] <bot-t> dersand, .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[12:08:45] <djQuery> StephenS, probably not with that description, every one got tired of the psychics answering questions befor they were asked so we kicked them all
[12:09:21] <StephenS> I fixed it myself though :)
[12:10:32] <djQuery> dersand, why are you delaying? are you just delaying to wait for the first code to finish?
[12:10:46] <djQuery> ?callback@dersand
[12:10:48] <bot-t> dersand, jQuery.Callbacks() | jQuery API Documentation - A multi-purpose callbacks list object that provides a powerful way to manage callback lists. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[12:10:53] <StephenS> djQuery, on every my page load, I have small delay when loading and showing ajax
[12:11:23] <StephenS> is there a way to that first element make static (with php from db) and then in meanwhile to match if current value == changeable value and if it is, to display ajax..?
[12:11:41] <djQuery> StephenS, so put the call to the rest of your code in the callback from the ajaz
[12:11:45] <dersand> i'm just delaying to wait before executing two particular strings
[12:11:48] <djQuery> ajax rather
[12:11:56] <StephenS> ha?
[12:12:05] <StephenS> no I mean Im updating only one number
[12:12:16] <StephenS> but for example its calling ajax even when there is no change (on default load)
[12:12:18] <djQuery> in the success of the ajax call do the rest of your stuff
[12:13:00] <djQuery> still if you just try and wait for the stuff to finish you might as well set the time to wait to be an hour
[12:13:25] <djQuery> otherwise you will run into some guy on dialup with errors because you didnt wait long enough
[12:14:16] <djQuery>  a call back is a method to write code that basicaly mean do this and when you are done with that do this other thing
[12:15:53] <StephenS> any example?
[12:17:29] <tfitts> is there a way to detect when the back button on the mouse is pressed?  I have an internal system where I want to make it so if a modal is open and the back button is pressed it will close the modal instead of moving off the page.
[12:18:23] <tfitts> preferrable just the mouse back button because if I'm going up to push back instead of closing the modal then I probably really want to go back, but I'll take either way.
[12:20:20] <discorpia> tfitts: i think you could do it with hashtags more or less, maybe a bit quirky. but something in the lines of http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[12:20:59] <tfitts> discorpia: can't believe I didn't think of that.  I've used that plugin before
[12:21:00] <jrajav> That sounds like kinda bad UX to be honest
[12:21:05] <tfitts> maybe because I didn't love it.
[12:21:12] <jrajav> ESPECIALLY having different behavior for the mouse button vs. the browser button. Don't do that
[12:22:34] <tfitts> jrajav: it's an internal system where I'm the primary user and the bad experience is when I expect back to close the dialog and instead it goes to another page.
[12:23:14] <tfitts> but I probably won't separate the mouse button from clicking it in the browser
[12:23:28] <tfitts> especially if I use the bbq or jquery history since they both work the same way.
[12:30:47] <djQuery> StephenS, look at fadein, it accepts a callback to run after the fade has finished
[12:31:38] <djQuery> StephenS, the success parameter of an ajax request is also a callback that does not run until the ajax has finished
[12:32:51] <hesperaux> hello
[12:33:00] <hesperaux> would anyone help me with Select2?
[12:33:13] <djQuery> hesperaux, see ?ask
[12:33:13] <bot-t> hesperaux, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:33:39] <hesperaux> http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/
[12:33:53] <hesperaux> right now i'm trying to do the "loading remote data" example
[12:34:20] <hesperaux> I cannot figure out what the select2 function 1)requires, 2)returns in this example
[12:34:49] <hesperaux> so far i've got it sending ajax requests to the right URL, but i don't know how to get the JSON data from that request put into the select2 container
[12:35:34] <hesperaux> the variables term, page, and data are also unclear to me in terms of how they are defined by select2
[12:40:58] <djQuery> hesperaux, well why dont you open up the debugger of your favorite browser and look at the trace to see what format they are returning the data in
[12:43:19] <djQuery> I hate it when plugins pile all thier examples into 1 page
[12:47:07] <hesperaux> djQuery, i have tried that, but i'm fairly new to javascript so some of this is confusing to me. it feels like some vars are just defined magically
[12:47:33] <hesperaux> i was hoping someone with more knowledge could ascertain what this function requires, since the docs have no info about it that i can see
[12:48:19] <djQuery> well it appears that thier ajax parameter is just a helper for the standard ajax
[12:48:37] <djQuery> in that case just refer to the jquery ajax documentation.
[12:48:46] <djQuery> hesperaux, see ?ajax
[12:48:47] <bot-t> hesperaux, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:49:31] <hesperaux> ok, i've used jquery's ajax() before
[12:50:06] <hesperaux> i think most of what's confusing me about select2 is the results variable
[12:52:36] <djQuery> it looks like a realy nice plugin
[12:53:24] <someprimetime> i'm using the cake users plugin and every time I POST my form and then follow a different link on my site and come BACK I get this error: Error: The requested address '/users/reset_password' was not found on this server.
[12:53:25] <hesperaux> i think it is too. i'm looking at the source code right now to see if i can figure out what the variables mean
[12:53:25] <djQuery> but as with a lot of plugins it looks like it maybe experiencing feature creep
[12:53:35] <StephenS> djQuery, I still dont get how to make fadein
[12:53:40] <someprimetime> replace /users/reset_password with any of the actions e.g. /users/login /users/register
[12:53:45] <someprimetime> woops
[12:53:46] <someprimetime> wrong channel
[12:53:46] <StephenS> I mean, whenever I load page its calling ajax request which slow down my website
[12:54:12] <StephenS> I want instant load within all other elements, and then just to update it lately..
[12:54:21] <djQuery> StephenS, is it realy slowing down or just presenting it in a different fashion
[12:54:27] <djQuery> nm
[12:54:32] <StephenS> dunno
[12:55:49] <StephenS> djQuery, http://jsfiddle.net/7Rj29/ is what I use
[12:55:59] <StephenS> its simple calling up, no ajax involved?
[12:58:31] <djQuery> hesperaux, have you looked at jqueryui autocomplete?
[12:58:39] <djQuery> hesperaux, see ?autocomplete
[12:58:40] <bot-t> hesperaux, jQuery UI - Autocomplete Demos & Documentation - The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. Here the suggestions are tags for programming languages, give "ja" (for Java or JavaScript) a try. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[12:59:19] <hesperaux> i have seen that, but I think i had a reason why it wasn't what i wanted. I'm checking it again
[12:59:59] <hesperaux> it needs to be a multiple selection that suggests from a database ajax call and also allows for new input terms. is that possible?
[13:00:20] <hesperaux> also, i really like the way select2 puts the entries into the box (with a little delete button, etc.)
[13:01:22] <djQuery> stephan48, http://jsfiddle.net/7Rj29/2/
[13:02:47] <StephenS> me?
[13:04:19] <StephenS> This does not work
[13:05:05] <StephenS> I dont get which function to use ?
[13:05:29] <StephenS> there should go my php code or what?
[13:12:22] <djQuery> StephenS, you do know that .load just internaly calls .ajax right?
[13:12:51] <StephenS> Yes
[13:13:47] <djQuery> StephenS, and that .load accepts 2 parameters the 2nd being what to do when it is done right?
[13:14:15] <hesperaux> djQuery, http://jsfiddle.net/sgxKJ/ I found this. The second example there is what I want, except I'd also like to be able to add entries not found too. Do you know how I could do this?
[13:14:19] <StephenS> Yes
[13:14:20] <polishnorbi> can anyone tell my why $.post is firing even if the form is not valid; http://pastebin.com/u05YRdjF
[13:14:38] <StephenS> so what shall I do when its done?
[13:15:33] <djQuery> StephenS, http://jsfiddle.net/7Rj29/4/
[13:17:48] <StephenS> right and when I put setInterval("updateBids()", 1); I get auto refresh all the time
[13:18:26] <djQuery> StephenS, and if it is bombing out fro some reason?
[13:18:43] <djQuery> StephenS, or taking longer than expected?
[13:18:51] <StephenS> but dunno what to do, if is not updated whats the point of ajax?
[13:19:14] <Eviltwin> setInterval(..., 1) is a terrible idea
[13:19:53] <djQuery> StephenS, if you don't have your setInterval inside you .load success functin then possibly you could have hundreds of calls going at the same time
[13:20:51] <djQuery> you should be doing settimeout instead and use it in the call back
[13:21:21] <StephenS> http://jsfiddle.net/7Rj29/5/
[13:22:31] <djQuery> StephenS, no with that code you have a definite mem leak
[13:23:02] <djQuery> everytime the load completes it will create a NEW interval to run the code
[13:23:04] <StephenS> do I need to use json with ajax?
[13:23:43] <StephenS> djQuery, then what to do? can you write an example
[13:23:45] <djQuery> StephenS, eventualy you WOULD have hundreds of them running

[13:24:43] <djQuery> oops
[13:24:52] <StephenS> djQuery, ok now I have this and its still not working
[13:25:02] <StephenS> now is not even displaying nothing
[13:25:33] <djQuery> Eviltwin, you wanna take over? gotta run
[13:26:19] <Eviltwin> I wish I could but so do I :(
[13:26:29] <StephenS> no way
[13:26:34] <StephenS> please help me quick :D
[13:26:41] <djQuery> gotta run to work
[13:27:01] <StephenS> just write me a quick example which works
[13:27:11] <StephenS> Ill implemate it
[13:27:40] <Eviltwin> Can you give me a super quick summary of the desired behavior?
[13:27:45] <Eviltwin> I don't have time to scan through the back and forth
[13:28:05] <StephenS> basically I tried using ajax which worked
[13:28:19] <StephenS> however it was loading data on first and every load when it should be static
[13:28:38] <StephenS> and it should load instantly from db and then if value change in db, then to update element with ajax
[13:28:48] <StephenS> since calling ajax everytime is slowing down my site
[13:29:32] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/7Rj29/7/
[13:29:34] <Eviltwin> So when the DB changes you want it to magically update on the page?
[13:29:58] <Eviltwin> One tweak: http://jsfiddle.net/7Rj29/8/
[13:30:15] <jrockjiggz> StephenS: another perspective: http://jsfiddle.net/7Rj29/9/
[13:30:55] <Whirl3d_> Eviltwin, djQuery, it's like the good ole days. LOL
[13:31:29] <StephenS> jrockjiggz, I dont need ajax on click
[13:32:44] <StephenS> djQuery, its still not working
[13:32:50] <StephenS> not updating element id="priceElement"

[13:35:40] <Eviltwin> But the top should be what you need
[13:36:41] <StephenS> Eviltwin, still not working

[13:42:08] <henn1nk> hello guys. i am trying to use slider of jqueryui but clicking on the slider i receive the error "closestHande is undefined". Jquery 1.8.21, Jquery UI 1.9.2. $('.slider_near_by').slider();  any ideas?
[13:52:34] <StephenS> can someone tell me what is wrong in this http://pastebin.com/8bRt290j
[14:04:12] <StephenS> Eviltwin, that code is updating over and over
[14:11:01] <raj> StephenS, what do you mean "updating over and over"?
[14:13:19] <nebmo> based on this script (http://jsfiddle.net/sushanth009/HMsfG/2/) it says "This will give the tr of the Element Which was changed" -> var $container = $(elem).parent().parent(); <- i want to remove the row so i changed to an onclick -> $(this).parent().parent().remove(); <- why doesnt this work?
[14:14:37] <Afflicto> Hello everyone. If I have a div with data-name attribute and a input field, is there a nice way to bind these together so when each of the values change, the other is updated? It could become a plugin I guess?
[14:16:52] <djQuery> nebmo, $(this).closest('tr').remove()
[14:16:58] <hugo_moss> mootools aint got nothin on jquery, am i right guys
[14:20:04] <StephenS> rsj how to access current data
[14:20:06] <djQuery> hugo_moss, wouldnt know never used them
[14:20:14] <StephenS> since updating settimeout every 1 second is not  good
[14:20:24] <StephenS> djQuery, you back from work already?
[14:20:37] <djQuery> nopes just got through getting ready
[14:24:33] <nebmo> djQuery: thanks. this is what ive put together so far (http://jsfiddle.net/NCM7A/26/) when trying to delete the other rows it refreshes the page though :S
[14:29:42] <hesperaux> i'm executing $.getJSON() based on a code example on jqueryui. for the callback function, it lists "response" and nothing more. I have not defined that function, but it appears to be defined. Is this part of the API or something?
[14:30:16] <hesperaux> nvm, i just realized what it is...
[14:31:36] <jrockjiggz> how is it that html() can eval() scripts, and not let any mal script break the browser
[14:32:02] <djQuery> jrockjiggz, who said it could?
[14:32:51] <jrockjiggz> djQuery: i've found that if there is a syntax error inside content loaded with html(), it does not stop the browser from maintaining previous bound events
[14:33:24] <djQuery> jrockjiggz, because those were allready bound
[14:34:27] <jrockjiggz> I'm trying to load fragment content in while still maintaining script integrity.. i've been able to achieve that using $.globalEval(this.text || this.textContent || this.innerHTML || ''); and it will take care of scripts within the fragment, but if there is a syntax error, all binding across the application die
[14:35:51] <jrockjiggz> rather.. $(data).filter('script').each(function(){  $.globalEval(...) });
[14:36:53] <lundy> Hi folks, im trying to create a script whichchecks for a internet connection and if its working then display a radio station.... if the internet goes down then refresh the page until the internet comes back online ...
[14:36:56] <lundy> http://jsfiddle.net/AKQjp/
[14:37:47] <lundy> for some reason this works ok if I click on Work Offline, but as soon as I turn off my router.... my browser still says navigator.online = true
[14:37:55] <bambu> I have a form with an ID of "login", is this the proper usage: $("#login").on("submit", function(event) {
[14:38:18] <jrockjiggz> yes
[14:38:22] <jrockjiggz> bambu: yes
[14:38:59] <jrockjiggz> lundy: sounds more of a browser limitation not updating
[14:39:09] <bambu> The form, not the input has an id of "login" it doesn;t work as expected.
[14:39:28] <nesoi> so I'm trying to use a jquery-mobile listview to display the user's phonr contacts, and I am finding that it takes about 20 seconds to display 2000 contacts. Am I doing something wrong or is that about what one would expect (modern dual processor phone)
[14:39:32] <bambu> event.preventDefault();  should stop everything from bubbling, right?
[14:39:40] <nesoi> phone
[14:39:52] <nesoi> contacts
[14:40:05] <jrockjiggz> bambu: your code is correct, it will catch the submit event (click submit button, enter to submit, any of way that you submit the form).. save as $('form').submit() or event $('form').trigger('submit')
[14:41:22] <hesperaux> i've been reading the docs, but i am confused. Stupid question: when I run .getJSON(), where does the received JSON data go?
[14:42:18] <jrockjiggz> hesperaux: use in callback $.getJSON(url, function(json){ console.log(json); });
[14:42:44] <hesperaux> is "json" a magic variable name, or did you just call it that?
[14:43:04] <jrockjiggz> i just called it that
[14:43:08] <jrockjiggz> i normally use data
[14:43:11] <hesperaux> okay
[14:43:25] <hesperaux> hmm
[14:43:57] <jrockjiggz> bambu: yes
[14:44:23] <hesperaux> jrockjiggz, okay i am seeing it in the console. looks good. my next question then is how to have this as a source: in .autocomplete()
[14:44:33] <bambu> jrockjiggz: I'm sorry. I wasn't saving it on the server. I also need to look into  event.stopPropagation();
[14:44:36] <bambu> Thank you.
[14:45:07] <hesperaux> source allows you to pass three types of inputs, one of which is response() {}, which is then passed down into .getJSON() in this example. What's going on here?
[14:45:38] <jrockjiggz> bambu: preventDefault() will prevent your form from doing its default behavior
[14:45:48] <hesperaux> from what i can tell, i have no control over response(), except to pass in a data object if i choose. I'm really confused...
[14:46:04] <jrockjiggz> hesperaux: i've never worked with autocomplete =/
[14:46:11] <hesperaux> hmm.
[14:46:18] <mg983_> hi all
[14:46:28] <bambu> Hi
[14:47:12] <mg983_> What type of plugin is needed to handle a site like this http://www.whitmansnyc.com/
[14:48:01] <jrockjiggz> scrollTo()
[14:48:52] <mg983_> yeah I guess that's all they are using
[14:51:19] <nebmo> im trying to fix the deleteTableRow function. (http://jsfiddle.net/NCM7A/26/). it runs the function successfully, but when trying to delete a new row it refreshes the page.
[14:55:09] <B|aster> hey I want to set a click handler on a div, but also have an input insde that div, and whne I click on the input, not have the click handler trigger.  Right now with a click handler on the div, clicking the input fires it.  What's the right way to do that?
[14:55:55] <StephenS> in my code jrockjiggz how can I check if data value is 0 or not?
[14:56:09] <bambu> jrockjiggz: Upon submit I take the data from an <input> and use ajax to authenticate the user.  Is there another way to get the value of the <input> besides setting a class/id on it?
[14:56:11] <StephenS> for example notification on fb are always on, but if != 0 then show pop-up notification bar
[14:56:19] <StephenS> I do not know how to deal with data inside jquery
[14:58:03] <B|aster> hey guys, here's an example.... http://jsfiddle.net/tsRur/
[14:58:15] <B|aster> see the input box?  How can I make it so that doesn't fire the click handler, but clicking anywhere on the green does?
[14:58:36] <jrockjiggz> StephenS: if(data === 0) is the simplest way
[14:59:02] <StephenS> ah I know that
[14:59:05] <StephenS> but data is wha
[14:59:08] <StephenS> t
[15:00:02] <bambu_> Can you select an ,input> from its name?
[15:00:07] <jrockjiggz> bambu: if the input is inside the form, you can add   data: $(this).serialize,
[15:00:12] <StephenS> jrockjiggz, http://jsfiddle.net/5vFJc/
[15:00:28] <StephenS> now if on page count.php?get=unanswered value is echo-ed as 0 tihs function should not do anyting
[15:00:32] <StephenS> that si what im tryig to do
[15:01:15] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/5vFJc/1/
[15:03:08] <B|aster> does anyone know the answer to this? http://jsfiddle.net/tsRur/
[15:03:21] <B|aster> I want it to alert when the green is clicked, but not the input
[15:03:34] <StephenS> jrockjiggz, nope
[15:03:42] <StephenS> it still displays notification pop-up as 0
[15:04:01] <jrockjiggz> B|aster: http://jsfiddle.net/tsRur/1/
[15:04:06] <StephenS> maybe because its not actual data, and its whole page?
[15:04:23] <B|aster> jrockjiggz:  Nice try, but when you click the input it still does the alert.
[15:04:31] <jrockjiggz> oops
[15:05:11] <jrockjiggz> B|aster: http://jsfiddle.net/tsRur/2/
[15:05:46] <B|aster> nice

[15:09:41] <StephenS> where is place for my php code?
[15:09:42] <jrockjiggz> are you trying to send data?
[15:09:56] <StephenS> no
[15:09:58] <StephenS> to receive data
[15:10:11] <StephenS> Im checking with php is in db num equal 0
[15:10:20] <StephenS> and if it is then do not display pop-up
[15:10:40] <jrockjiggz> why is your php there?
[15:10:48] <StephenS> where it should be?
[15:10:55] <StephenS> its also in ajax/...
[15:11:02] <StephenS> but thats the info I pull out from db
[15:11:32] <jrockjiggz> if your loading the page, then wrap if() around the script code
[15:12:07] <jrockjiggz> are you sending data, receiving data, or rendering with data?

[15:13:55] <wfq> something like the picture on the top right on this link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)
[15:15:25] <StephenS> jrockjiggz, what is that?
[15:15:47] <StephenS> I dont get why do you check twice the same thing?
[15:15:56] <StephenS> and I need to not execute jquery when data is 0
[15:15:59] <StephenS> not when it is
[15:16:02] <jrockjiggz> StephenS: i don't know what you are trying to achieve
[15:17:04] <jrockjiggz> i'm confused why you have php $data
[15:17:30] <StephenS> jrockjiggz, Im trying to do wa FB did
[15:17:49] <StephenS> FB have ajax always online for notitification, but when notification is 0 they do not call pop-up
[15:18:15] <StephenS> the problem is I cannot access data with $data = <span id="priceElement"></span>
[15:18:40] <jrockjiggz> echo $data, then bind to it. if you dont want a binding, dont bind to the elements
[15:19:07] <StephenS> how to bind?
[15:19:11] <StephenS> Im super confused
[15:20:18] <jrockjiggz> StephenS: i dont see any code that opens anything
[15:20:56] <Es0teric> alright so i have to append closing brackets in a json request... how do i do that with $.get()"?

[15:21:26] <jrockjiggz> not sure if that will work lol
[15:21:34] <jrockjiggz> oh sorry, append..
[15:21:43] <Es0teric> jrockjiggz its not an html structure... its JSON data
[15:21:57] <jrockjiggz> json + "{}" ?
[15:22:09] <jrockjiggz> hmm
[15:23:59] <Es0teric> jrockjiggz wait wht?
[15:24:01] <Es0teric> *what
[15:25:38] <jrockjiggz> Es0teric: why do you need to append?
[15:25:59] <Es0teric> jrockjiggz i am trying to pull data from a api... but they forgot to add closing brackets
[15:26:14] <Es0teric> plus its not retrieving the data in my json request, it just returns a 200 without the data
[15:26:57] <jrockjiggz> you can use $.ajax({ dataType: "text/html" }); you'll be able to manipulate it then
[15:27:16] <jrockjiggz> i guess you want to use get though.. does getJSON maybe fix it for you?
[15:27:57] <jrockjiggz> dataType: "html"
[15:28:11] <Es0teric> jrockjiggz nah getJSON does not fix it for me
[15:28:44] <Es0teric> jrockjiggz getJSON only retrieves the headers and cookies... it doesnt pass in data
[15:28:57] <jrockjiggz> dang
[15:29:39] <Es0teric> jrockjiggz yeah man... its really lame
[15:31:44] <Es0teric> jrockjiggz how do i get the data back using $.ajax(); though?
[15:32:43] <bambu> So this should work, as it is?  http://bambuseae.org/login.html
[15:33:48] <bambu> Oh my bad :p
[15:35:42] <bambu> No, it still doesn't work :p

[15:39:28] <Es0teric> jrockjiggz yeah i'll check that out thanks
[15:39:30] <jrockjiggz> Es0teric: maybe http://jsfiddle.net/MYNNS/2/

[15:42:27] <Es0teric> jrockjiggz nah that doesnt work man... tried modifying it myself
[15:42:43] <Es0teric> jrockjiggz all of that still returns the data at 200
[15:42:50] <Es0teric> but it doesnt show data on the console
[15:43:02] <Es0teric> yet if i go to the actual link, it shows me the json data
[15:45:10] <jrockjiggz> Es0teric: maybe you can use error to catch
[15:46:04] <mouses> do you guys do hacks to fix windows/chrome ugly font rendering or do u just say fuck it?
[15:46:26] <Es0teric> jrockjiggz it wont do error if it passes as 200
[15:46:28] <Es0teric> would it?
[15:49:16] <Es0teric> oh wow... it did activate error
[15:49:40] <dersand> how do i make so that i can write content in an element? like innerHtml
[15:51:14] <Es0teric> dersand .html()
[15:51:23] <dersand> okay thanks
[15:52:27] <dersand> so if i write .html(a variable) it will say <p>variables value</p>?
[15:53:09] <Es0teric> dersand it would have to be $('#elemid').html('<p>' + var + '</p>');
[15:54:24] <dersand> but if #elemid is already a p tag?

[16:29:09] <Criten> Hey, is keydown only suposed to trigger once per keypress?
[16:29:39] <Criten> It seems to be triggering till i let up
[16:40:37] <cusco> Criten: try keyup
[16:42:42] <Criten> cusco: I need the keydown event too... keyup works fine : /
[16:43:06] <Criten> I think i can get it working.
[16:43:34] <Criten> I'm sending keypresses over websockets... so i just want to send it on keychange
[16:44:53] <b-lew> http://landpros.turnpostinteractive.com/LandPros_Results_2.html -> is there a reason why my slider is working in all modern browsers but in IE8 its not at all?
[16:49:57] <Afflicto> So I finnished writing my jQuery plugin. bind two element attributes together by $.pairAttrs('.container', 'data-width', 'input', 'value'); Change the data-width of .container will update the value of input (or the other way around). I wonder if this will be useful :P
[16:50:04] <Afflicto> http://jsfiddle.net/wjPA6/48/
[16:51:28] <KinoftheFlames> I'm new to jQuery. How would I get an adjacent element based on ID from a listener's call element?
[16:52:21] <Afflicto> KinoftheFlames:If I understand you correctly, you want  $("#myElement").siblings()//returns adjecent elements.
[16:52:55] <KinoftheFlames> okay, and how would i grab the sibling by id?
[16:53:17] <Afflicto> $("#myElement").sibligns("#aSibling");
[16:53:25] <KinoftheFlames> thanks, I'll try that out
[16:53:26] <Afflicto> siblings*
[16:53:57] <Afflicto> Although, it returns all siblings, if you just want the first sibling after or before your element. I think you need another function.
[16:54:46] <Afflicto> I think $("#myElement").next("#aftermyElement") returns the next sibling. there is .prev() too.
[16:55:20] <systemfault> Wouldn't make sense to have an id as the selector in .next() though..
[16:55:44] <Afflicto> systemfault: that's true, didn't think about that.
[16:56:32] <Afflicto> KinoftheFlames: remember that ID's are supposed to be unique. you may experience unwatned behavior if they aren't.
[16:58:04] <KinoftheFlames> unique for the whole DOM or just the nested structure
[16:58:13] <systemfault> If you have more than a single element with the same id, your HTML is crap.
[16:58:15] <systemfault> Fix it.
[16:58:19] <Afflicto> The whole dom.
[16:58:22] <KinoftheFlames> okay
[16:58:33] <KinoftheFlames> thanks that code worked
[16:58:34] <systemfault> For the whole page.
[16:59:23] <Afflicto> nice np
[17:00:35] <KinoftheFlames> trying to code up a webpage showcasing my skills for an interview, the only problem is that I dont have any real experience with any languages they use
[17:01:45] <systemfault> KinoftheFlames: You have two choicesâ€¦ learn them or forget the interview ;)
[17:01:56] <KinoftheFlames> haha i know
[17:09:53] <nsanden> can anyone help me with this please: http://jsfiddle.net/M6GRZ/   - when you click a checkbox i just want it to hide the div before it. i tried using prev() and closest() but not having any luck
[17:19:24] <gnarf> nsanden: nothing has the class replace_part_checkbox
[17:20:56] <nsanden> gnarf: first checkbox
[17:21:24] <gnarf> nsanden: doesn't have class="replace_part_checkbox" ?
[17:21:38] <gnarf> oh i suppose it does
[17:21:44] <gnarf> so whats up with the <table> here
[17:23:00] <gnarf> nsanden: the <div> is not a parent of the <input> so it doesn't get found by closest, you wanna like look upward for a td then find the div with the class I assume: http://jsfiddle.net/M6GRZ/1/
[17:23:36] <nsanden> gnarf: thank you thats what i want

[17:50:31] * Afflicto released his new jQuery plugin on github. https://github.com/afflicto/jQuery.pairAttr
[18:02:51] <bitpimp> I need certain draggables to return to their original position when a button is clicked (think incorrectly placed scrabble tiles flying back to their original place on the piece holder).  Any suggestions?
[18:09:17] <WebHome> I am using the following JS on a drupal site:  http://pastebin.com/RmCw0grK  It makes a region with text fade in over an image.  On first page load, the region displays first, then the image loads and the region repositions and fades in.  On page RELOAD, it works as expected.  I'm not really good at jQuery, but is there a way to make this snipplet work _after_ the page is loaded, and not before?
[18:09:57] <WebHome> or, should I go into the actual CSS and make the region display:none instead of hiding it in the jQuery snipplet?
[18:25:54] <garbagecollectio> if i do Array.prototype.blah = function() {    }

[22:43:54] <fuzzyone> anyone use x-editable, I'm trying to see if there is a show event
[22:50:41] <thomedy> i did it... i did it  im ade my first jquery plug in... im a bad ass
[22:50:58] <thomedy> okay im a passionat e person so its going to get worse as more exciting things happen for me
[22:51:23] <Es0teric> thomedy i know what that feels like... i felt that same way when my first php app worked
[22:51:54] <thomedy> im decent at php... but i have a strong strong strong possibilityy for landing my first front end full time position
[22:52:29] <thomedy> i have mostly done javascript but they told me they prefer jquery so i want to make myself required   indespensible... so i just taught myself to write my own jquery plug in
[22:52:40] <thomedy> and ready for this.... its 8k / month
[22:52:46] <thomedy> freakin i want this so bad
[22:52:59] <Es0teric> yeah, i need to get a gig like that too man
[22:53:00] <thomedy> im going to write a jquery plug  in to incorporate three.js
[22:53:04] <Es0teric> but its hard in NYC, thomedy
[22:53:27] <thomedy> is it... im in the m iddle of the country i didn't expect this at all... but i showed my code...and  im a go getter
[22:53:30] <cusco> jquery plugin?
[22:53:51] <cusco> you mean use jquery so you get to know it, thus being able to apply it
[22:54:17] <cusco> such as ajax
[22:54:21] <Es0teric> i mean i am not that good at jquery
[22:54:22] <thomedy> no i mean im already decent at jquery... but i prefer total creative freedom and for examp[le i havent  checked in a bit but as far as i know
[22:54:25] <Es0teric> but as long as i see the data
[22:54:25] <cusco> very usfoul, and good place to start
[22:54:29] <Es0teric> i know what i need to do with it
[22:54:32] <thomedy> jquery doesnt use r
[22:54:35] <cusco> ow
[22:54:36] <thomedy> rAF's
[22:54:41] <cusco> what is rAF's ?
[22:54:44] <thomedy> see
[22:54:57] <thomedy> requestAnimationFrame... its the most current way to animate
[22:55:09] <thomedy> taking advantage of focused frame's and what not
[22:55:25] <thomedy> so if i can write my own jquery plug in i think i will have come full circle a
[22:55:28] <thomedy> and now i can
[22:55:29] <thomedy> i just dit
[22:55:31] <thomedy> did it
[22:55:35] <thomedy> okay...
[22:55:43] <Es0teric> thomedy not for nothing but that sounds like a flash thing
[22:55:43] <Es0teric> o.O
[22:56:00] <thomedy> well think about it... javascript and html5 is on the way to becoming the new flash
[22:56:19] <cusco> hah
[22:56:20] <thomedy> and flash isn't accomodated as much aand going out anyway
[22:56:29] <cusco> animation frame from a gif?
[22:56:33] <thomedy> and yes  for that reason it intential does sound like flash
[22:56:35] <thomedy> nope
[22:56:37] <cusco> or a bunch of png's ?»
[22:56:41] <thomedy> i have done 3d animation without pngs
[22:56:43] <Es0teric> man.... i havent worked on flash in a LONGGG time
[22:56:59] <thomedy> utilzing z-scale and 3d space
[22:57:22] <thomedy> its SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO exciting and that is going to be my jquery plug in
[22:58:01] <thomedy> this is the reason i got into pure javascript so i could be  front end beast and im getting there think at least
[22:58:02] <Es0teric> oh i see...but does anyone know a good jquery plugin that reads pdf's to use with turnjs?
[22:58:09] <thomedy> never tried
[22:58:13] <thomedy> okay work to do
