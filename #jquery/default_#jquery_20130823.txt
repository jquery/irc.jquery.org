[00:01:02] <doug65536> dreamhawk: if the server side code is doing something stupid like not giving you an array of one item, then you will have to use hacks to compensate
[00:01:51] <doug65536> dreamhawk: show code. I'm getting tired of trying to squeeze information out of you. good luck
[00:03:08] <dreamhawk> doug65536: ok wait
[00:06:49] <dreamhawk> doug65536: you need more than this ? http://pastebin.com/D0tPBZ49
[00:11:21] <doug65536> dreamhawk: so all the customers are in data?
[00:11:26] <doug65536> dreamhawk: in an array?
[00:12:22] <dreamhawk> doug65536: now i only have 1, but yes. Some customer data, not to heavy.
[00:12:51] <doug65536> dreamhawk: you wrote the server side code?
[00:13:38] <doug65536> dreamhawk: here's what I think is happening:
[00:13:52] <dreamhawk> doug65536: yes, and im getting a valid json-array
[00:14:23] <doug65536> the server side code has a bug that causes it to not give you an array when there is one customer. so "each" loops over all the fields instead of looping through the customers
[00:16:40] <dreamhawk> doug65536: {"ConsumerID":"1", "Network":"foo"} , like now
[00:16:54] <doug65536> that is not an array
[00:17:03] <doug65536> that is one object
[00:17:26] <dreamhawk> hmm ok

[00:21:00] <doug65536> dreamhawk: ^
[00:21:20] <dreamhawk> doug65536: thank you , easier to see now
[00:22:48] <doug65536> dreamhawk: the right fix would be to change the server code so it always sends an array, even if there is one customer
[00:23:31] <doug65536> dreamhawk: then v.ConsumerID would be that customer's ID, and the each would be per customer
[00:23:54] <dreamhawk> doug65536: yeah, im checking at that now.. i am using php , mysql_fetch_assoc and json_encode() for that right now (on my working server i am using PDO instead of mysql() )
[00:25:52] <doug65536> dreamhawk: ok, and it's supposed to be all the customers right? I suggest something like $customers = array();    then in your SQL loop, do your $customer = mysql_fetch_assoc, and array_push($customers, $customer). then after the record loop, json_encode that
[00:26:11] <doug65536> json_encode the whole $customers array
[00:26:23] <dreamhawk> doug65536: yeah, found a guide for that, i am going to try that way
[00:31:33] <dreamhawk> doug65536: that looks better, do you know how to do when i use "SELECT * FROM ..." to loop everything ?
[00:32:47] <doug65536> dreamhawk: yes 1 sec
[00:34:30] <doug65536> dreamhawk: are you using mysql_ or mysqli api? procedural or object oriented
[00:35:00] <doug65536> you used mysql_fetch_assoc ?
[00:35:01] <dreamhawk> doug65536: mysql_  for now, i want to switch to PDO, but its alot of work at the moment
[00:35:06] <dreamhawk> doug65536: yes
[00:36:56] <lemonsparrow> hola
[00:37:13] <doug65536> dreamhawk: https://gist.github.com/doug65536/57c11de3827070f7a674
[00:39:19] <dreamhawk> doug65536: can you explain why exit(json_encode.. )) *curious* :)
[00:41:25] <doug65536> exit sends what you pass it as the response. if anything gets sent after the json it won't decode (it will be invalid). php is notorious for emitting crap that you didn't expect. exiting with the json guarantees that won't happen
[00:41:38] <dreamhawk> Nice :)
[00:53:49] <Styx51> hi all
[00:54:01] <Styx51> i have an issue with accordion
[00:54:28] <Styx51> it calcs the height but cannot resize scrollbar
[00:54:32] <Styx51> any help ?
[00:55:21] <Styx51> cannot find anything on api
[00:55:24] <Styx51> to solve it
[00:57:45] <Styx51-[French]-> ?
[00:58:06] <Styx51-[French]-> any french people there ?
[01:09:44] <thebigkiwi> Anyone know a script that would be similar to http://activetv.tv
[01:19:14] <dreamhawk> doug65536: finally i got it working... the 2nd problem i had was , i was populating html with html += ".. html .."; and suddenly html was always empty ... but i had to make $.ajaxSetup async false
[01:20:31] <doug65536> dreamhawk: avoid async false if possible. you can probably fix that issue a much better way than that
[01:21:17] <doug65536> dreamhawk: now it locks up the browser until the response is received, right?
[01:21:48] <doug65536> dreamhawk: move the code that depends upon the response into the completion handler
[01:22:11] <doug65536> dreamhawk: getJSON returns long before the ajax data is sent from the server
[01:23:26] <doug65536> dreamhawk: seriously, async false sucks
[01:25:13] <dreamhawk> doug65536: yes, i would like to fill the div after each data has loaded, but how? append?
[01:25:31] <doug65536> dreamhawk: can you show the getJSON code?
[01:25:54] <doug65536> I know you sent it already but it'll be a pain to search through the scrollback
[01:26:07] <doug65536> plus you probably changed it right?
[01:27:11] <dreamhawk> doug65536: some, yes.. :)
[01:30:05] <dreamhawk> doug65536: http://pastebin.com/4YLeSyJr
[01:30:50] <doug65536> dreamhawk: what did you add async false for?
[01:31:11] <dreamhawk> doug65536: html didnt populate .
[01:31:35] <doug65536> dreamhawk: I find that hard to believe. you should remove it. it's garbage
[01:31:39] <dreamhawk> console.log(html) after showed "empty string"
[01:32:04] <dreamhawk> doug65536: but anyway, have any other suggestion? like, append ?
[01:32:19] <doug65536> yes, remove async false
[01:32:38] <doug65536> it's retarded
[01:33:33] <dreamhawk> but now html fucks up and returns garbage xD
[01:33:35] <doug65536> you thing that code inside the getjson code will run before getjson returns? it won't remove that idiotic async false, and set the content of the div at line 13 of your paste
[01:35:00] <doug65536> http://pastebin.com/MeLsWPbX
[01:39:20] <doug65536> dreamhawk: you're a waste of time
[01:47:20] <dreamhawk> :/ geez... thanks for help, dont have to be rude .. we are all n00bs sometime
[02:08:03] <notore> when i write my code to text file and open it in browser the alert doesn't show up: http://pastebin.com/YnC2xvLF but when i do that in jsfiddle it works, why? http://jsfiddle.net/Vh7sZ/
[02:09:06] <seutje> notore: at the time you run your script (in the head), the button doesn't exist yet cause the browser hasn't parsed that far
[02:09:38] <seutje> notore: jsfiddle wraps the JS code in a window.load event handler, so it only runs after the document has been parsed (and then some)
[02:09:56] <seutje> either move your scripts to the end of the body
[02:10:14] <seutje> or wrap them in a $(document).ready(function(){ ... }) wrapper
[02:10:34] <seutje> you can use the shorthand doc.rdy wrapper by just using $(function(){ ... });
[02:11:17] <seutje> notore: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[02:13:53] <notore> seutje: actually i tried that before but i can do that once more http://pastebin.com/fRzjsqHE but still doesn't work
[02:14:22] <seutje> notore: you are also trying to use jQuery before it's included
[02:14:30] <notore> ah yeah
[02:14:32] <seutje> swap your script blocks around
[02:14:35] <notore> ok now it works
[02:14:39] <notore> thx
[02:15:04] <seutje> you should be getting a "$ is not a function" or "undefined is not a function" or "undefined doesn't support the method 'ready'"
[02:16:03] <notore> what do you mean? where i should be getting that?
[02:16:14] <seutje> in the console output
[02:16:31] <seutje> (when trying to use jQuery before it's loaded)
[02:17:11] <anli> Is not jquery accordion operating on ul+li:s?
[02:17:19] <anli> multi level accordion
[02:18:01] <joobz> Guys, is there any reason this wouldnt work .. $(this).css("background-color", "#c0c0c0"); $("li[style='background-color:#c0c0c0;']").removeAttr("style"); ?
[02:18:19] <anli> Add a class instead
[02:18:21] <joobz> the first line sets the background-color style on the li i am clicking on.. this works fine
[02:18:52] <joobz> the second line removes all styles set in the dom, .. so im expecting the background color to be set and very quickly unset
[02:18:57] <anli> $(this).addClass('light-gray'); and $('.light-gray').removeClass('light-gray');
[02:19:18] <joobz> ahh
[02:19:22] <anli> Then you create a style thats .light-gray { background: #c0c0c0; }
[02:19:24] <joobz> can do, but why wouldnt the above work ani?
[02:19:32] <anli> Dunno, but its bad anyway ;)
[02:19:35] <joobz> .. jsut for knowledge sake
[02:19:37] <joobz> ahh
[02:19:42] <anli> yeah, I understand that you want to know
[02:19:45] <anli> I dont ;)
[02:21:12] <seutje> joobz: because the style attribute probably doesn't match that string exactly
[02:21:24] <seutje> it's up to the browser to decide on spacing and stuff afaik
[02:22:06] <seutje> so it could be "background-color: #c0c0c0;", "background-color:#c0c0c0;", " background-color: #c0c0c0;", "background-color: #c0c0c0; ", ...
[02:22:07] <wild_oscar> hey.I'm having a serious wtf moment in jsfiddle
[02:22:07] <joobz> ahhh
[02:22:11] <joobz> thanks, makes sense
[02:22:26] <wild_oscar> when I press "ctrl+return" to update the example, it'll stop working
[02:22:29] <seutje> so it might actually work on some browsers, but not on others
[02:22:58] <joobz> hmm
[02:23:16] <joobz> so this works.. "$(this).addClass("active");" .. but straight after I do "$("li.active").removeAttr("style");" which doesnt remove it
[02:23:20] <joobz> .. ie, it stays grey
[02:23:30] <joobz> .active is wehre i have applied the background-color to
[02:23:48] <joobz> any idea?
[02:26:03] <joobz> weird.. it works with removeClass()
[02:26:12] <joobz> which is probably cleaner, but not sure why that didnt work with removeAttr
[02:31:16] <xuma> hi , i am trying to publish my plugin at plugins.jquery.com but getting "Missing required field: licenses[0].url" error.I checked ,changed jquery.json several times but i cant fixed.Any idea ?

[03:14:13] <gryzor_> str.text(foo) gets the code to be displayed, not interpreted
[03:14:19] <gryzor_> what should i be using instead ?
[03:14:36] <gryzor_> err, i meant foo.text(str)
[03:17:11] <gryzor_> ( "#foo" ).val(str) displays nothing
[03:19:05] <gryzor_> ( "#foo" ).html(str) was it

[04:31:07] <hazamonzo> hey folks. Im looking through a very large object in my degubber... is there a method (im using chrome debugger) to search for an object property / method?
[04:35:29] <hazamonzo> degubber? i meant debugger :)
[04:46:43] <seutje> hazamonzo: Object.keys(obj)
[04:47:15] <hazamonzo> seutje: Sorry but could you go into a little more detail?
[04:47:47] <seutje> Object.keys({foo: 'bar', meh: 'poo'}); // 'foo, meh'
[04:48:35] <seutje> then u can just indexOf that
[04:49:54] <innociv> forEach() and see if key = val.  If it's "very large" then you should probably index references.
[04:50:03] <innociv> manually
[04:52:11] <seutje> "if key = val" ?
[04:52:25] <seutje> oh, val as in the key he's looking for
[04:57:39] <seutje> boytoy: it doesn't seem to support reverting back to non truncated, except by manually overwriting the styles/markup and removing the window resize handler

[04:57:46] <b-ot> seutje: Issue #2 by tiquelou (28mon 3w ago): Add #destroy method
[05:00:33] <daslicht> hello I am trying to use jqueryUI resizeable on images
[05:00:34] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/fU3gb/
[05:00:50] <daslicht> as you can see iots working with the static added image
[05:01:04] <boytoy> seutje: oh i see i see
[05:01:08] <daslicht> but tryt to add an image in the content editable area by using the insert iomage button
[05:01:30] <daslicht> it inserts the image , its also resizeable BUT its aspect ration is not fixed ?)
[05:01:34] <daslicht> any idea why ?
[05:03:25] <seutje> daslicht: upon calling $('.resizable'), that class hasn't been added yet
[05:03:41] <seutje> daslicht: can't you pass the arguments when initializing it?
[05:04:11] <daslicht> how do you mean
[05:04:12] <daslicht> ?
[05:04:15] <seutje> daslicht: http://jsfiddle.net/fU3gb/8/ seems to work
[05:04:36] <seutje> daslicht: instead of going .resizable(); .resizable({aspecRatio: true}), just do it in 1 call
[05:04:47] <daslicht> yeah the picture wich is already in teh example works fine
[05:05:09] <seutje> example I posted works in the contenteditabel
[05:05:24] <daslicht> $(".resizeable").resizable({aspectRatio:true})
[05:05:27] <daslicht> that is one call
[05:05:45] <daslicht> hm not here
[05:05:47] <daslicht> strange
[05:05:52] <daslicht> maybe a browser issue
[05:05:57] <daslicht> i try with other browser
[05:06:10] <seutje> no clue what ur on about
[05:06:54] <seutje> you were basically re-initializing the resizable with a different option, and on a different selector
[05:07:29] <daslicht> oops
[05:07:36] <daslicht> that line was double sorry
[05:07:57] <daslicht> it should just look like this : $(".resizeable").resizable({aspectRatio:true})
[05:08:02] <daslicht> not that sinlgle line
[05:08:08] <daslicht> sorry for the confusion
[05:08:32] <seutje> -_-
[05:08:42] <seutje> that class is added by the resizable
[05:08:53] <seutje> so you can't target it before it has initialized on said element
[05:09:14] <seutje> oh wait, it isn't
[05:09:17] <seutje> funky
[05:09:48] <boytoy> seutje: just got word from the smarttruncation author
[05:09:56] <boytoy> seutje: he says he'll implement destroy soon
[05:09:59] <daslicht> hah it was the line i missed to remove
[05:10:20] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/fU3gb
[05:10:22] <daslicht> now working
[05:10:26] <daslicht> stupid me
[05:10:27] <daslicht> :)
[05:10:31] <daslicht> thanks
[05:10:48] <seutje> I mistyped resizable
[05:11:03] <seutje> or rather, I mis-mistyped it
[05:13:57] <fuchstronaut> I have an element that I clone, manipulate and than prepend/append to another one
[05:14:43] <fuchstronaut> it works fine and all, but when I have a for-loop and try to append 3 elements, nothing is happening if my append/prepend is not used in a setTimeout()
[05:14:48] <fuchstronaut> what is the matter?
[05:14:59] <fuchstronaut> i thought javascript will do the code line-by-line
[05:15:14] <fuchstronaut> so everything should be cloned and manipulated before it attempts to append the element
[05:16:19] <fuchstronaut> funny thing is, that a timeout with 0 ms is enough time for js to append the element..
[05:22:58] <JavaLover> need help too many trolls in #php
[05:23:36] <JavaLover> so I have data using php, that I echo back from a jquery .load();   what I want to know is if I want the next 10 posts how should I store them?
[05:29:02] <fuchstronaut> JavaLover: that's because your nick is "JavaLover"
[05:29:23] <fuchstronaut> JavaLover: you can create an array/var before your load() and than store whatever you want
[05:29:37] <JavaLover> i get this i'm asking what you think is good method
[05:29:46] <JavaLover> I know how to do each method, i'm just curious which is standard
[05:30:17] <JavaLover> like is it best practice to actually query to see if a post has changed when scrolling down?
[05:30:24] <JavaLover> or should i just store the one that existed at the time?
[05:37:37] <Tumulte> hey !
[05:39:23] <seutje> JavaLover: basically a pager implementation?
[05:39:39] <Tumulte> I'm looking for a very simple script to monitor upload progress of a multi-file input
[05:39:48] <Tumulte> any suggestion ?
[05:39:50] <fuchstronaut> JavaLover: I think I dont know what you are going to do, maybe a snippet of code would help
[06:32:23] <obert> is v1.4.4 correct to be used?
[06:36:29] <xec_> "correct" is relative
[06:36:34] <xec_> but 1.4.4 is old
[06:42:00] <obert> i assume it is the last i saw in the download dir which support older ie
[06:42:57] <obert> maybe i am wrong
[06:44:46] <obert> last question, i hope :p in html5 type="text/javascript" is deprecated, correct?
[06:48:43] <le_gars> hello a question about .serialize()
[06:49:05] <le_gars> Im doing that on a form object but not really sure it is having the effect that I want
[06:50:10] <obert> yes, it is deprecated
[06:50:22] <le_gars> Im saving the form in a form var then saving that in a values var where I do "formVar.serialize"
[06:51:36] <le_gars> and when I console.log the object it gives me "function (){return b.param(this.serializeArray())} "
[06:51:55] <le_gars> so .serialize() is deprecated?
[06:52:09] <le_gars> should one use .serializeArray() instead
[06:57:35] <dokma> i receive an HTML string from an AJAX request
[06:57:51] <dokma> I'd like to move one div into another within that string and append that to another div
[06:57:59] <dokma> any quick tips on that?
[06:58:12] <escher> le_gars:  No. .serialize() and .serializeArray() do different things. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10430502/whats-the-difference-between-serialize-and-serializearray and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4235052/why-does-serialize-have-the-same-effect-as-serializearray-when-setting-post
[06:58:41] <micaelbergeron> dokman: probably want to use .wrap()
[06:59:29] <le_gars> ok thanks so it is no deprecated then?
[06:59:47] <dokma> micaelbergeron, not exactly
[07:00:04] <dokma> I get an HTML string returned and within that string I need to move one div into another
[07:00:19] <dokma> how do I make jQuery operate on a string of html?
[07:00:30] <micaelbergeron> well add it to the dom before, then manipulate it
[07:00:47] <micaelbergeron> use a hidden div to host it
[07:01:21] <dokma> ok
[07:01:45] <micaelbergeron> jquery canno't manipulate strings, you should look at something else then, maybe a regex-fu, but that'd probably be slow :)
[07:01:59] <micaelbergeron> keep it simple and it will work.
[07:04:12] <obert> why my page is trying to call a jquery-1.10.2.min.map ?
[07:04:21] <obert> i never saw .map before
[07:05:45] <fuchstronaut> dokma, micaelbergeron: there is no need to place it in a hidden div, just $( string ) and you can manipulate the object
[07:05:53] <fuchstronaut> jquery takes care of the object somewhere in the dom
[07:06:00] <micaelbergeron> yeah that's right actually
[07:06:27] <fuchstronaut> obert: maybe you have a script-tag where you are pointing to a .map file?
[07:06:30] <micaelbergeron> I was just not 100% sure of it, but if you confirm, that is the best way to do it.
[07:06:53] <dokma> fuchstronaut, I did: elements = $(response);
[07:06:53] <fuchstronaut> thats the way i usually do it, i mean we use jquery for the comfort, arent we :P
[07:07:11] <duckgoose> obert thats a source map. it's normal.
[07:07:13] <fuchstronaut> dokma: just wanted to point out, befor you start appending and hiding elements :)
[07:07:32] <duckgoose> you can just ignore it or put the .map file in the same location as jquery
[07:07:45] <obert> duckgoose: normal? how to fix it then
[07:08:02] <dokma> fuchstronaut, but now I can't find an element that is in that HTML <div id="ce7">
[07:08:02] <duckgoose> put the .map file in the same folder as jquery.js, or just ignore it
[07:08:18] <dokma> $('#ce7', elements) is nothing
[07:08:21] <obert> duckgoose: which .map file? i don't have idea where it comes from
[07:08:42] <duckgoose> it should be at the same place where you downloaded jquery
[07:08:52] <duckgoose> what version?
[07:08:58] <obert> 1.10.2
[07:09:24] <duckgoose> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.map
[07:09:40] <obert> http://jquery.com/download/
[07:10:04] <obert> there is written nothing about
[07:11:05] <fuchstronaut> dokma: you should be able to find it like that $(response).find('#ce7')
[07:11:20] <fuchstronaut> without seeing anycode its hard to guess whats wrong
[07:11:47] <dokma> nope

[07:13:01] <dokma> fuchstronaut, http://jsfiddle.net/5Nyb3/
[07:13:28] <obert> sigh nothing is working now. http://pmesconsulting.com
[07:14:55] <fuchstronaut> dokma: http://jsfiddle.net/5Nyb3/1/
[07:15:34] <fuchstronaut> find will search inside your jquery object(s), your <div> is toplevel, so it can't be found. Either you wrap everything in a div or just use filter()
[07:15:49] <obert> i am talking about the login link
[07:16:03] <fuchstronaut> i would go with filter as it is faster as find (i guess), since it is not searching deep
[07:16:25] <obert> perhaps the html is wrong
[07:16:48] <micaelbergeron> IMO you should probably wrap everything in a div when it comes out of an AJAX request. Just feels right to have a 'single' element.
[07:17:28] <fuchstronaut> obert: it is not working for me either
[07:17:30] <micaelbergeron> I mean, AJAX request _should_ return a single element. That's my 2 cents.
[07:17:38] <micaelbergeron> :)
[07:18:17] <fuchstronaut> obert: But I am getting this upon loading "TypeError: $.browser is undefined"
[07:18:19] <obert> fuchstronaut: infact, but it seems it is about html
[07:18:42] <obert> maybe that .map is something needed by chrome browser, not my script and it is just wrong the html
[07:18:49] <obert> i will check it and report it:p
[07:18:57] <fuchstronaut> obert: i checked in ff
[07:19:07] <dokma> fuchstronaut, now it works all right!
[07:19:15] <dokma> I just added a redundant div around everything
[07:19:26] <obert> fuchstronaut: mhmh
[07:19:43] <fuchstronaut> dokma: if you know the div you are searching for is a child of your wrapper, children() will be faster than find()
[07:19:58] <fuchstronaut> though I don't know if you will feel the difference
[07:20:00] <obert> thanks for now
[07:33:26] <obert> the html is fixed now but it stil no working
[07:33:29] <obert> no more idea.
[07:34:20] <anli> I have a css inclusion thats using media="screen and (max-width: 500px)". Width of what?
[07:34:29] <anli> document or window?
[07:37:27] <c4ptnh00k> window
[07:38:24] <anli> I created a script that reacts on window size changes, it seems to not trig at the same spot as the css engine
[07:39:16] <c4ptnh00k>  The browser identifies itself as being in the “screen” category. This roughly means the browser considers itself desktop-class — as opposed to e.g. an older mobile phone browser (note that the iPhone, and other smartphone browsers, do identify themselves as being in the screen category), or a screenreader — and that it’s displaying the page on-screen, rather than printing it.
[07:43:55] <obert> duckgoose and others: it was an issue related to the other scripts (colorbox and cycle)
[07:44:20] <anli> I had to var w = $(document).width(); and compare that with <= 500
[07:44:23] <anli> Not window
[07:44:55] <obert> now the awesome login link works \o/
[07:45:25] <obert> crazy huh?:)
[07:51:24] <obert> thanks people for the help
[08:06:54] <c4ptnh00k> given I have a webform that will have a dynamic number of address entries, would it be better to add form elements to the page or have one form and add a set of labels to the page showing what has been added?
[08:07:50] <c4ptnh00k> knowing im going to need to update the db with the values on .submit()
[08:08:49] <Cronoh> just one text input, address?
[08:09:19] <c4ptnh00k> no its 6 different text boxes
[08:09:35] <c4ptnh00k> adr1, 2, city, state, zip, country
[08:11:14] <c4ptnh00k> seems like from a ui/ux standpoint having one inout section would be better, but from a dev side just clone the input section and do a .each( ajax stuff)
[08:15:39] <anli> Hm, $(window).resize() does not fire when the window width goes below 960 pixels, thats very strange
[08:16:54] <anli> Oh, my fault
[08:30:20] <Tumulte> hey again
[08:31:04] <Tumulte> I've got the files of a multiup input thanks to prop
[08:31:18] <Tumulte> can I store the result as an array rather than an object ?
[08:32:47] <c4ptnh00k> yes
[08:33:07] <Tumulte> c4ptnh00k: cool !
[08:33:28] <Tumulte> how ?
[08:35:18] <c4ptnh00k> <input type="file" name="MultiFile[]" id="uploadFileId" class="multi"/>
[08:35:35] <c4ptnh00k> make the name an []
[08:36:18] <c4ptnh00k> then when checking for your $_FILES you can loop
[08:38:11] <Tumulte> c4ptnh00k: this is done already... but I can't remove a file from a file list
[08:38:20] <Tumulte> and That's what I was trying to do
[08:38:39] <c4ptnh00k> ok well you didnt ask that lol
[08:39:31] <Tumulte> c4ptnh00k: I thought the object type was an Array, went a bit too fast obviously
[08:39:34] <c4ptnh00k> in that case the asnwer is no
[08:40:38] <c4ptnh00k> you can not remove a single file from the file list. it is readonly
[08:41:24] <c4ptnh00k> you can clear it all though and re populate only what you want, but not sure the exact way to do that. Just trying to think for you a bit.
[08:42:03] <thinkt4nk> I have a friend who's just discovered asynchronous programming.  Does anyone have any resources that serve as good primers for working with higher order functions and async programming?  Anything that deals specifically with jquery would be particularly helpful
[08:43:08] <c4ptnh00k> api.jquery.com
[08:44:16] <Car7i> hi there, im using media element player for audio and i have content loding ajax and media element wont start loading or anything its all stocked there on request work but on ajax not
[08:47:26] <Fenikkusu> http://jsfiddle.net/zUasC/ Anyone know what is going on here? Intenerally, elm._objOptions.selDialog is being set on both elements, not just the element it applies to.
[08:48:43] <Fenikkusu> For clarification, clicking on either link results in the dialog for the second link opening. It should instead be only on the second that it opens the seconds dialog, and the first auto-generates a dialog that just says 'help'.
[08:49:49] <Fenikkusu> Lines 54 Through 60 should auto set the selDialog option on just the given element, but it's doing it to all elements.
[08:50:46] <c4ptnh00k> seems excesive for a dialog box
[08:53:19] <Fenikkusu> Well the circumstances call for it. They are all help dialogs, but some just need simple help while others have indepth html. The indepth html should show if it exists, otherwise it defaults to the on-the-fly version.
[08:53:31] <Fenikkusu> (And of course any other thoughts/suggestions are welcome).
[08:55:10] <c4ptnh00k> just wondering here but it seems like the only selector you are using is the .help class which both links share
[08:55:29] <c4ptnh00k> also only 1 div here for dialog
[09:01:37] <c4ptnh00k> nvm i see your var tSelector = '#dlg' + $(tThis._objElement).attr('id'). dude sorry but I give up this seems obfuscated as hell
[09:06:01] <lolmaus> How do i prevent children from reacting on click? I tried `event.StopPropagation()` but it doesn't work: http://jsbin.com/ISoz/4/edit?html,js,output
[09:15:35] <NoiseEee> lolmaus: you don't, its how bubbling works.  you can try something like http://jsbin.com/IsoDaCA/2/edit
[09:16:10] <marcules> lolmaus, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2457246/jquery-click-function-exclude-children
[09:17:35] <NoiseEee> lolmaus: even better than my example is the one with 33 votes on the link marcules pasted
[09:18:42] <marcules> NoiseEee, why wouldn't you choose to overwrite the children listeners?
[09:18:53] <marcules> I mean - besides that you'd create X amount of new listeners
[09:19:01] <NoiseEee> for that reason really
[09:19:06] <marcules> Oh okay
[09:19:06] <marcules> :D
[09:24:16] <Whirl3d> where can I find a hosted version of a jquery UI theme?
[09:24:47] <Whirl3d> I'm using jquery_ui hosted on Google, but where is the css to go with it?
[09:33:25] <sunbeam> does anyone know if its possible to convert a facebook link to the ID (of the facebook link) ?
[09:34:58] <Wanfu> with using jqueryUI's resizable, I have multiple divs that are next to each other, all within a certain size of a container div. how can I make it when I resize one , if it Make it smaller, it makes the one below it larger, automatically. Or am I just going to have to do it al manually
[09:36:42] <Wanfu> kind of like flexboxes
[09:43:21] <jarray52> I'm trying to understand this code snippet. https://dpaste.de/sZZGg/ I haven't seen this variant of syntax. Is this binding an event? Or, is it doing something else?
[09:45:08] <shoky> jarray52: it's calling a jquery plugin method on a jquery object. in this case it's initializing a dateinput plugin, with 2 options, on the elements matching .reference
[09:50:56] <jarray52> shoky: So, in this case; the dateinput method is being called with one argument, which in this case is a compound object consisting of min and format. Thanks.
[09:51:29] <jarray52> shoky: That clarified things. Thanks.
[09:55:22] <Narigo> hi there, how can i select all <script> tags that have a src attribute set?
[09:55:50] <shoky> $('script[src]')
[09:56:39] <Narigo> shoky, thanks, how can i select tags with multiple attributes set? $('script[src,data-something=true]') ?
[09:56:55] <CWSpear> you can chain the [ ] syntax
[09:57:09] <CWSpear> script[src][data-something="true"]
[09:57:28] <Narigo> CWSpear, thanks :)
[09:57:43] <ItalianStallion> Hi there, can someone please visit my page http://desktopsites.com/ and tell me why my Slider Module is displaying twice? I've used "jQuery Easy" plugin on Joomla 2.5 to try fix js issues.. now I have 2 slider modules showing..

[09:59:28] <ItalianStallion> have one slider module, it's showing up twice..
[10:00:04] <alpha080> show me twice ,too
[10:07:10] <ItalianStallion> @<alpha080> have any idea why??
[10:08:06] <jop008> is there a way to get all elements with an id like this optionselect_* * is a wildcard
[10:08:14] <jop008> these are input elements
[10:08:30] <ItalianStallion> Hi there, can someone please visit my page http://desktopsites.com/ and tell me why my Slider Module is displaying twice? I've used "jQuery Easy" plugin on Joomla 2.5 to try fix js issues.. now I have 2 slider modules showing..
[10:09:56] <jop008> it is like this ("input[type='text'][id*=" + strID + "]:visible").each(function() {
[10:09:56] <jop008>     this.value=strVal;
[10:09:57] <jop008> });
[10:10:19] <RRR2> shouldn't paste code here
[10:15:46] <Fenikkusu> c4ptnh00k, Thank you
[10:16:28] <c4ptnh00k> Fenikkusu: no problem
[10:17:46] <boytoy> hey is it if() or if () which one do you guys prefer?
[10:18:05] <talntid> if ()
[10:18:21] <boytoy> talntid: whats your reasoning behind that?
[10:19:03] <Fenikkusu> Personally I skip the space. Less characters to send to the browser and it just seems clearer to me.
[10:19:09] <Fenikkusu> cleaner*
[10:19:21] <boytoy> Fenikkusu: yeah i know what u mean
[10:19:28] <boytoy> plus jquery does it too with on() etc.
[10:19:39] <boytoy> if() it is, cheerio mate
[10:20:14] <ringo_> yeah, if() without space is more "accepted" for js, i think
[10:20:47] <ringo_> if with space, i mean, oops
[10:21:05] <ringo_> if (x == y) {
[10:21:18] <ringo_> i thought you meant if ( x == y ) {
[10:21:35] <boytoy> ah nah
[10:21:40] <boytoy> :)
[10:21:48] <ringo_> functions usually have no space after the function name
[10:21:55] <Fenikkusu> ...Sadly I just made a hypocrit of my self...go figure...just looked at the code I'm working on and every one has the space....go figure...
[10:21:56] <ringo_> but conditionals usually do
[10:22:18] <boytoy> if () {} or if() {}
[10:22:33] <boytoy> Fenikkusu: hehe yeah :)
[10:22:36] <ringo_> 'if (x == y)' and "function doThis()'
[10:22:41] <boytoy> ringo_: thats true
[10:22:53] <boytoy> good point
[10:23:12] <boytoy> yeah imma settle for if() {} and call it a day
[10:23:15] <ringo_> that's standard across most languages i think
[10:23:26] <ringo_> suit yerself ;-)
[10:23:42] <boytoy> hehe
[10:23:42] <Fenikkusu> I do know the one that really bugs me is when people put spaces between everything, especially in Wordpress. if ( this === that ) { } else if ( that === there )
[10:23:44] <boytoy> ill sleep on it
[10:24:04] <ringo_> yeah, i know, i don't like that either
[10:24:31] <ringo_> boytoy, there are programming style guides you can consult, too
[10:24:49] <boytoy> Fenikkusu: do they do that on purpose or could it be their text editor?
[10:25:00] <boytoy> ringo_: oh yeah, i need to get me some of those!
[10:25:40] <Fenikkusu> boytoy, I feel like they do it on purpose. Unless it's sublime. I know most the WP guys at my work use Sublime (I use Eclipse), so it may be the editor.
[10:26:31] <DansVC> hello
[10:26:37] <DansVC> someone help me?
[10:27:38] <boytoy> Fenikkusu: maybe they're coding really really fast and dont want to lose their train of thought
[10:28:01] <boytoy> saying to themselves "i'll deal with the spaces later" but then forget :P
[10:28:51] <DansVC> How i make a loop
[10:28:57] <DansVC> inside a other function
[10:29:01] <DansVC> called with on
[10:29:02] <DansVC> http://jsfiddle.net/DansVC/5hrK4/
[10:31:06] <DansVC> nobody?
[10:32:13] <Whirl3d> DansVC, are you new to html/js /jquery? Because I don't know that you are starting with valid html
[10:32:25] <Whirl3d> Never heard of the <alert> tag before
[10:32:28] <DansVC> i konw
[10:32:35] <DansVC> its a new project
[10:32:47] <Whirl3d> Well, first fix the html then worry about making it do fun stuff
[10:33:07] <DansVC> yes
[10:33:44] <DansVC> but how I make a loop for a function?
[10:34:30] <Whirl3d> Tell me how long this piece of string is and I can help you with your function
[10:35:50] <DansVC>  piece of string?? sorry i dont understand
[10:36:02] <Whirl3d> that demonstrates my point.
[10:36:21] <Whirl3d> You want help with creating a loop in a function...there are a million ways to loop in a function
[10:38:05] <DansVC> fine
[10:38:15] <DansVC> http://jsfiddle.net/DansVC/5hrK4/2/
[10:38:22] <DansVC> now have a html tag
[10:38:32] <DansVC> but still not working
[10:41:26] <Fenikkusu> Who knows boytoy, who knows.
[10:43:31] <DansVC> how to make a function within a loop?
[10:43:32] <Fenikkusu> DansVC, $('p').each(function() { alert($(this).attr('id')); }); might be closer to what you are looking for.
[10:44:06] <soahccc> I have a large image (8kx8k) which I want to split down into 512x512 pieces (it's a tile map). Then I have a 16x16 div construct which I want good controls for (zoom&pan)... What is the easiest way for this? (I hope I don't need google maps stuff)
[10:44:51] <Fenikkusu> c4ptnh00k, Figured it out. The $.extends(true, prototype.defaults, options) should of been $.extends(true, {}, prototype.defaults, options) (Truncated Code)
[10:45:04] <DansVC> Fenikkusu thx
[10:47:05] <Fenikkusu> DansVC, Correction, make that $('p').each(function() { $(this).on($this.attr('class'), function() { alert($(this).attr('id'));});
[10:47:14] <Fenikkusu> Granted that's not tested.
[10:47:45] <DansVC> Feni, dont work
[10:49:13] <Fenikkusu> DansVC, http://jsfiddle.net/DansVC/5hrK4/2/
[10:49:24] <Whirl3d> DanVC, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5hrK4/3/
[10:49:28] <Fenikkusu> I can't type right that's why.
[10:51:22] <DansVC> whir that only will work with 2
[10:51:27] <DansVC> alerts
[10:51:53] <Whirl3d> How many you want?
[10:51:57] <Blaster> how do you prevent an AJAX call when there is already one running?
[10:52:24] <Blaster> Would I just check for jQuery.Active?
[10:52:56] <Fenikkusu> You could override the ajax method such that it has a flag to kick out if set.
[10:52:58] <DansVC> all many have
[10:53:11] <DansVC> in the page
[10:53:18] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5hrK4/4/
[10:53:21] <Whirl3d> there's 4
[10:53:23] <Blaster> Fenikkusu:  How?
[10:55:38] <Fenikkusu> Easiest way would be to say something to the effect of ;(function($) { var _isSending = false; $.fn.myAjax = function() { if (_isSending) { return this; } _isSending = true; $.ajax(arguments).done(_isSending = false); }; )(jQuery);
[10:55:58] <Fenikkusu> Granted that is just off the top of my head, but you should get the idea.
[10:56:20] <Blaster> cool thank you.
[11:04:07] <serAphim> hey guys. i'm stuck with a really weird situation. i use jqueryui tabs with, and when loading specific content from specific places (100% reproducable) the javascript which is loaded via ajax just isn't executed. it's just in some situations, others work fine. i tried setTimeout, but it didn't help, so it's not a timing issue. firebug doesn't give me a message, and running the code which is loaded through the firebug console works as expect
[11:04:07] <serAphim> ed
[11:04:31] <serAphim> i stripped the answer down as far as possible, here it is: http://pastebin.com/SmErwBHD
[11:06:19] <serAphim> it's gotta be something about the delegate() function - i moved that from the tabs to the ajax layout, since then i experience that behavior. can't move it back though...
[11:11:52] <Brodingo> serAphim man half that script is your selector
[11:19:04] <serAphim> Brodingo: what do you mean?
[11:21:13] <Brodingo> serAphim you can cache var $content = $("#loadedContent5217a2e8-0ce0-4653-b91e-12d02e1331b6"); to help clean up the code a bit
[11:22:38] <serAphim> ah, ok. thought you had an idea what's wrong with it :/
[11:23:14] <eddiemonge> what kind of selector is that? how do you remember that?
[11:23:48] <serAphim> it's unique for that ajax request
[11:23:48] <Brodingo> its ULTRA unique
[11:26:09] <eddiemonge> i think its unique for every ajax request. but again, how do you remember that? why is that there?
[11:26:17] <eddiemonge> and whats the original problem anyway?
[11:26:36] <Brodingo> loaded script in an html response not running i think
[11:26:40] <serAphim> the js isn't executed in this situation
[11:27:39] <serAphim> it's somehow connected, as it's the same problem with all "index" pages, and only if coming from a "view"
[11:27:51] <eddiemonge> ok then im out. im not a fan of returning html with embedded JS
[11:27:51] <Brodingo> ?getscript
[11:28:06] <Brodingo> robotsss
[11:29:16] <eddiemonge> serAphim: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/ Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it.
[11:29:36] <serAphim> just looked at it, but i don't have a file because of the unique id...
[11:29:49] <cool> Guys, I am plotting a graph of change in a integer value(lead count) over time using google chart api. so I rounded the time to nearest 30mins but this led to duplicate values(e.g at 6:30) how do I detect duplicates & add them? http://ubuntuone.com/3NMEtWYkhQSCHx4RERVcgq
[11:30:09] <cool> If doesn't make sense, kindly let me know. I would rephrase my questions. Thanks
[11:35:34] <Brodingo> cool jquery?
[11:36:43] <Whirl3d> serAphim, are the scripts that you want executed being loaded? or are they already loaded and not applying to your dynamically loaded content?
[11:37:15] <cool> Brodingo: how do I do this jquery? I am stuck :|
[11:38:01] <serAphim> Whirl3d: it's loaded with the ajax call - if i copy and paste it in firebug it's executed
[11:38:24] <Whirl3d> yeah, then getScripts is the way to go.
[11:38:39] <Brodingo> cool check to see if the value youre going to insert is already in the new array?
[11:38:50] <Brodingo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[11:39:12] <cool> Brodingo: if this would have been normal string, I would have done it easily but this is a date object. Not sure how do I compare objects, if they similar, then add them existing element. else just to array.push()
[11:40:21] <eddiemonge> serAphim: id redo it since its not in the same call
[11:40:43] <Brodingo> cool not sure about like performance wise but you could probably map the array each time and get the timestamp
[11:41:37] <cool> Brodingo: well, if timestamp is need, I can enable that from the backend. that's the easy part. But how would timestamp help here?
[11:42:09] <cool> Because I also want to round them off to nearest 30minutes, ie half-hour chunks grouping
[11:42:33] <cool> I did this & this is where I got confused
[11:43:19] <jarray52> Does the event object specify the selector that was used to trigger the event?
[11:43:45] <Brodingo> yeah so youre pushing the new rounded time to an array, you should be able to check if that time is already there and skip it
[11:46:13] <cool> Brodingo: Don't want to skip existing time but do the sum but yea what you are saying makes sense. So I should create a new array like I tried with normalized_data & try to push data into it?
[11:46:39] <cool> normalized_data is in the code http://ubuntuone.com/3NMEtWYkhQSCHx4RERVcgq
[11:47:33] <serAphim> Whirl3d, eddiemonge: so when it's inline it's not executed because...?
[11:47:57] <Brodingo> cool oh yeah i see, so you want to combine leads if the times are rounded together
[11:48:10] <insign> Hi. My form have fields and values, why .serialize() are returning ""? Any idea? http://jsfiddle.net/insign/xGuW3
[11:48:35] <Whirl3d> serAphim, I am not sure...i just know that it isn't.
[11:48:51] <cool> Brodingo: Exactly. And what I am having trouble with is checking if [hrs, mins,0] already exists. If yes, then sum it. else do array.push
[11:49:12] <insign> Anyone already have problemas with .serialize()?
[11:49:15] <Whirl3d> I think it has to do with the js compiler. It compiles as the page loads. But ajax then just looks like text to the js compiler
[11:50:06] <Whirl3d> it's done it's thing and doesn't think it has to look for any other js to compile. That's why GetScripts works, it' recompiles external js for you...All complete guess on my part.
[11:50:07] <insign> Oh, I found.
[11:50:57] <Brodingo> cool hmmm maybe build it as an object with the timestamps as keys
[11:51:06] <serAphim> Whirl3d: but as it's a dynamic script i'd need to have an additional request every time when i use an external file :/
[11:51:38] <serAphim> that bit of code comes with every single ajax request, and most of the time it's not an issue
[11:51:39] <Whirl3d> unless you want to preload the script and apply it after the page loads the new content
[11:52:55] <serAphim> it'd need to only affect the new content, not the old one
[11:53:14] <eddiemonge> what does the script do?
[11:53:27] <Whirl3d> are you having problems with specific classes of code that you could preload or is it all inline
[11:54:07] <cool> Brodingo: right, after get we get normalized_data then try try to do date.getMinutes & date.getHours. trying to see if this works or not
[11:54:21] <eddiemonge> insign: what was the problem?
[11:54:47] <insign> eddiemonge, really thanks, I forget to put name attr in <inputs>
[11:55:00] <serAphim> eddiemonge: hide loading overlay, .button(), and .on() for links so they get loaded in the tab panel too
[11:55:54] <Whirl3d> set your .on to the tab that doesn't get loaded the events bubble up.
[11:55:55] <eddiemonge> wy does that have to be dynamic then?
[11:56:21] <cool> Is there a function which can return true if particular key exists in array?
[11:56:22] <serAphim> Whirl3d: i certainly could preload some of it, and i will definitely look where i can work with getScript at a later point - today i just wanna have that error go away and me go home ;)
[11:56:46] <Whirl3d> So, handle your events on the non-dynamic parent
[11:57:33] <Brodingo> cool you should just be able to test if(obj[key])
[11:57:34] <Whirl3d> $("tab").on("click", function (e) { var targ=$(e.target); e.preventDefault(); if (targ.is(".buttonclass")) {hideOverlay();}{);
[11:57:58] <cool> Brodingo: something like typeof arrayName[index] == 'undefined'?
[11:58:03] <serAphim> i had the .on on selectedPanel before, changed the selector to see if it works then :D
[11:58:37] <Brodingo> lots of ways
[11:58:59] <serAphim> and the on stuff works fine - when i get to see the links the behave as expected
[11:59:19] <Whirl3d> do the same with links
[11:59:49] <Whirl3d> $(".tabs").on("click", function (e) { var targ=$(e.target); if (targ.is("a") { handle your links here
[12:00:25] <Whirl3d> * add an e.preventDefault(); to keep the default action from firing on your links
[12:06:58] <cool> Brodingo: I think that worked, does this(if conditional part) make sense to you http://ubuntuone.com/3NMEtWYkhQSCHx4RERVcgq
[12:08:53] <Brodingo> cool i think youll want to to normalized_data[dt_rounded][i]['lead_count'] += graphData[i]['lead_count']
[12:09:08] <Brodingo> you just want to add to the leads right?
[12:09:13] <cool> Yes
[12:12:52] <cool> Brodingo: It throws TypeError: normalized_data[dt_rounded] is undefined
[12:13:11] <Brodingo> cool i meant instead of commenting out that if statement just making the else clause only add to the 'lead_count'
[12:13:42] <Brodingo> (and dont forget your semicolons)
[12:15:30] <cool> Brodingo: Not sure If I follow. Can you show some code on what you mean?
[12:16:08] <cool> (and yes, I will add simicolns.  I am rubyist, so its bit unnatural )
[12:17:03] <Brodingo> http://jsfiddle.net/jxesU/
[12:20:39] <cool> Brodingo: Correctly me I am wrong. in this,"normalized_data[dt_rounded][i]['lead_count']" having a i counter will not add the leads. But instead create a sub-array
[12:20:54] <cool> when the dt_rounded timestamp is same
[12:26:57] <Brodingo> cool hmm, well then do you need [i] ?
[12:27:20] <dopie> hey guys
[12:27:24] <dopie> why isnt this working
[12:27:25] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/5ea0bcdff82f145ba92e
[12:28:04] <serAphim> Whirl3d: i moved the scripts to an external file and put that in the header, having only ajaxReady() inline now - same behavior. i assume there's ascript somewhere stopping all js execution under certain circumstances or so...gotta dig deeper
[12:28:31] <Brodingo> dopie is jquery loaded? why are your script tags all up in that html?
[12:28:55] <Whirl3d> serAphim, do you have a link you could share?
[12:29:08] <dopie> how do i check if its loaded
[12:29:23] <dopie> http://mcfps.staycreativedesign.com/
[12:29:33] <Whirl3d> and you don't need ajax ready inline either, I'd be willing to bet.
[12:29:57] <Brodingo> dopie check your console
[12:30:17] <dopie> i get this

[14:12:43] <Ortund> hey everybody
[14:13:55] <Ortund> so I was just scrolling on a page on my website where I have a "back to top" button which just scrolls back to the top of the page and I wondered about how I could have the menu which sits across the top of the page snap to the top of the browser window when the user scrolls past it... I'd google here, but not sure what to search for, can anyone make a suggestion or two?
[14:19:18] <Whirl3d> the problem is that you would have to manually administer the position of the elment the entire time, I think.
[14:19:24] <Whirl3d> You can't have it inline
[14:20:39] <Whirl3d> but bascially, you would listen for the parent' scroll position and set your button to fixed position once the parent was scrolled to the- y position of the scroll link
[14:20:58] <Whirl3d> then you could pop it out and position:fixed
[14:21:06] <NoiseEee> or just always position:fixed?
[14:21:22] <Whirl3d> but then it only appears at th top
[14:21:28] <Whirl3d> or the bottom
[14:21:49] <Whirl3d> he wants to hav e the user scroll past it and have it lock on the top
[14:22:19] <Whirl3d> I would stay position fixed on the top and then hide it if you are at the top of the page
[14:27:13] <rashkov> Strange question... I am using .data() on some img elements, then deleting those img elements, and then re-creating some new img elements in their place. For some reason the .data attached to those brand new img elements is still the same old stale data from the previous img elements. I've tried calling .removeData() on the first set of img elements before .remove(), but that doesn't help. My site is here: rashkov.github.io/moviemash and the 
[14:29:37] <Ortund> Whirl3d I've got some jquery there which according to the answer on stackoverflow where I got it, should work, but while I'm not getting any errors, nothing's happening at all
[14:30:18] <eddiemonge> rashkov: try empty?
[14:35:51] <rashkov> eddiemonge: Thanks eddiemonge. While trying out your suggestion I realized that it's a problem with my own code's logic. Not jquery's fault. Thanks for the inspiration!

[14:40:07] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[14:40:51] <_str> how can i disable bootstrap typeahead force selection of first completion set?
[14:44:19] <Whirl3d> HOLY MOSES, it's coldhead.  How are you?
[14:45:04] <tw2113> coldhead, have you been hiding from me?
[14:47:22] <coldhead> nothing personal
[14:47:28] <coldhead> teaching class full time
[14:47:46] <coldhead> impossible to IRC with those beady little student eyes staring at me
[14:47:48] <tw2113> i wouldn't have blamed you regardless
[14:48:08] <coldhead> but they're almost graduated and then they will be society's problem
[14:50:05] <coldhead> what have i missed?
[14:51:08] <horsik> i wonder how relevant ie6,7 compatibility is these days
[14:52:23] <tw2113> not much for me horsik
[14:52:37] <coldhead> depends on the application, horsik
[14:52:43] <tw2113> however, check your analytics if you must
[14:52:52] <coldhead> if you're trying to get money from stupid people then ie6 and 7 is your target market
[14:52:59] <horsik> tw2113: mainly for users not developers
[14:53:45] <tw2113> as a developer, check the user analytics
[14:54:06] <tw2113> if you're still getting 10% user base, it may be worth considering
[14:54:16] <tw2113> if you're getting anything above 40%, definitely consider it
[14:55:39] <horsik> i know that a lot of companies uses obsolete os and browsers and if you develop app for them you should take that in mind
[14:55:56] <snover> coldhead: why donâ€™t you love me any more
[14:56:14] <horsik> and probably use the least js you can
[14:56:53] <horsik> but what about 'regular' users, i don't know anyone who uses ms browsers
[14:57:12] <coldhead> i love you more than ever snovesy
[14:57:27] <tw2113> like i said horsik...check your analytics
[14:57:28] <coldhead> absence makes the heart richer in good cholesterol or w/e

[14:58:17] <pixelpimp> if you're getting 50 on a 100 visit list, start getting better users ;P
[14:58:20] <tw2113> with IE6-7, it should be very conditional, and not based on "global usage stats"
[14:58:21] <horsik> tw2113: let me check stats of my old app
[15:00:23] <eddiemonge> Whirl3d: i feel the same
[15:01:27] <Whirl3d> eddiemonge, I am not really convinced it is THE coldhead we are seeing. No sarcasm, really?
[15:02:48] * boytoy checks
[15:02:56] <boytoy> nope it's her
[15:03:17] <coldhead> accept any and all substitutes
[15:04:55] * boytoy tastes
[15:05:01] <boytoy> yup definitely her =)
[15:06:01] <eddiemonge> coldhead: how long have you been around here?
[15:06:19] <coldhead> years
[15:06:21] <tw2113> i think coldhead has been in here since before jquery
[15:06:23] <Whirl3d> only since it started getting good
[15:06:29] <coldhead> longer'n i can remember
[15:06:36] <coldhead> 1.2.something?
[15:07:11] <eddiemonge> definitely not coldhead
[15:07:23] <eddiemonge> the standard response is: "its my first day"
[15:07:31] <coldhead> that's a different question
[15:07:37] <coldhead> how long have i been USING jquery
[15:07:38] <boytoy> lulz
[15:07:40] <coldhead> it's my first day
[15:07:59] <coldhead> god i have been away so long i have forgotten my own catch phrases
[15:08:05] <coldhead> what a sorry day for humanity
[15:08:23] <tw2113> yup, you're an alien
[15:08:37] <coldhead> it's just i've been so worried about mandela, guys
[15:08:42] <coldhead> mendela!
[15:08:58] <Whirl3d> oblongota?
[15:08:58] <Zerd> I knew it, we're not alone in the universe! UFO's videos are real!

[15:53:05] <delinquentme> datatables and appending custom code INTO the datatable?

[15:53:18] <delinquentme> table headers
[15:56:30] <davidaragon> Can someone answer a question about event bindings with .on() ?
[15:56:49] <pixelpimp> depends what that question is
[15:58:13] <horsik> i have to learn d3 to draw one fucking chart
[15:58:26] <davidaragon> I bound a resize event to the window like this: $(window).on('resize', a)
[15:58:45] <davidaragon> before i did this I defined a and b: a = function() { 'a' }; b = function() { 'b' }
[15:59:13] <davidaragon> after running the .on() statement, i checked to make sure the event was actually bound, and it was: $._data(window, "events").resize
[15:59:19] <davidaragon> that returned an object
[15:59:37] <davidaragon> Then I called .off() with a *different* handler function: $(window).off('resize', b)
[15:59:51] <davidaragon> according to the docs that should have left my original event binding untouched, since the parameters were different
[16:00:03] <davidaragon> However when i check the event binding, it's gone: $._data(window, "events").resize
[16:00:08] <davidaragon> that returns undefined
[16:01:12] <delinquentme> horsik, your best bet is to find the chart you want to draw
[16:01:15] <davidaragon> so somehow $(window).off('resize', b) killed my event bound with $(window).on('resize', a)
[16:01:30] <delinquentme> say ... on the d3 gallery ... then replace labels and values
[16:02:23] <horsik> delinquentme: this type of chart doesn't exist yet
[16:02:49] <delinquentme> horsik, so its not like a "hive plot" or  a "bar graph "
[16:02:59] <delinquentme> you might try posting pics of a hand drawn version
[16:03:04] <delinquentme> idk might save you some time
[16:03:59] <horsik> delinquentme: i know what type of chart it is
[16:05:31] <horsik> it's a horizon chart with multiple series
[16:06:46] <horsik> there is a plugin for horizon charts out there but it's so poor that i guess it will be easier to write my own
[16:08:32] <doug65536> davidaragon: of course it did. what do you think 'off' does?
[16:08:47] <doug65536> davidaragon: oh nevermind, I see
[16:08:57] <doug65536> davidaragon: a and b are completely different objects?
[16:09:04] <davidaragon> if parameters are passed, including a handler function, it's only supposed to unbind events that were set wight hat exact same handler
[16:09:10] <davidaragon> yes they are
[16:09:36] <doug65536> davidaragon: that's hard to believe, can you show code?
[16:10:06] <coldhead> that were set wight hat exact
[16:10:08] <davidaragon> i can paste the console session where I reproduced that
[16:10:51] <doug65536> davidaragon: I'll try to reproduce / prove that won't happen in fiddle

[16:49:44] <wild_oscar> hi. I'm trying to add code to prevent double submission of a form by double clicking the submit button
[16:50:29] <wild_oscar> I've tried the obvious choice of disabling the button
[16:50:36] <wild_oscar> such as the answer in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5944254/preventing-double-click-of-submit-button
[16:50:58] <wild_oscar> with the attr alternative (app has an older version of jquery)
[16:51:07] <wild_oscar> everything works as expected...except in chrome
[16:51:19] <wild_oscar> the button is disabled...but the form isn't submitted
[16:51:25] <wild_oscar> do you have any idea why
[16:51:26] <wild_oscar> ?
[16:55:22] <serAphim> wild_oscar: try the second answer - hook it to $('form').submit(function() {
[16:59:47] <wild_oscar> serAphim: aha. hooking it up to form.submit works1

[17:15:16] <doug65536> clarkk: yes, don't use slideToggle :) but seriously, you can use .is(':visible') before your call

[17:16:23] <doug65536> bugs that make it do the opposite of correct
[17:18:32] <clarkk> doug65536: do you have any docs on that?
[17:20:33] <doug65536> clarkk: it's not a jquery bug - it's bugs in your own code that screw that up

[19:21:02] <Jinxed-> but doesn't seem to do anything
[19:21:40] <jarray52> Is it normal for the datepicker calendar popup not to function after a form submission? Does the dateinput need to be rerun after form submission to reattach the element?
[19:22:20] <KYLEtheBAKER> i have a submit button that i want to check if any divs with the class of 'error' exists when its clicked, if there are any divs with class of error, then i don't want the button to submit the form, rather i want to create another div with some text, if there are no error divs then i want it to submit. what i'm unsure about is how to make the form submit or not based on the conditions
[19:23:17] <KYLEtheBAKER> it doesn't need to be on click either, i'd prefer it to update without, maybe have the button have a red border if errors exist, or green if its okay to submit, i'm just unsure with this method how to poll the dom for any changes, like an error div being added or removed
[19:44:01] <sayd> is there a selector for jquery so i can pass in ['id1','id2']
[19:44:47] <sayd> instead of $.map(['id1', 'id2'], function(id) { return $('#' + id) })
[19:47:11] <pixelpimp> $('#id1, #id2')
[19:47:40] <sayd> ya, but the data is in ['id1, id2']
[19:50:22] <sayd> crap, doesnt matter. i cant use this approach
[20:01:40] <sayd> how about a push that doesnt add duplicates?
[20:22:21] <doug65536> got some of my 3d css animation stuff working http://jsfiddle.net/aTsyS/98/
[20:22:26] <tw2113> rmurphey, i find it pleasantly amusing that your clicker at JSConf this year was a wii remote
[20:24:16] <p3rror> hello
[20:24:25] <p3rror> how to hide this block <div class="alert alert-error">
[20:25:05] <doug65536> p3rror: to hide everything on the page with the class "alert": $('.alert').hide()
[20:25:25] <p3rror> doug65536, does not work
[20:25:30] <doug65536> p3rror: if that's not what you want, you haven't provided enough information to answer it
[20:25:42] <doug65536> p3rror: then the problem is somewhere else. show code
[20:27:30] <doug65536> p3rror: I wrote this today: http://jsfiddle.net/aTsyS/98/   do you believe I know how to hide a div?
[20:29:30] <Snerf> p3rror, that is how you hide it.. you very could have something unhiding it
[20:29:54] <p3rror> doug65536, http://dev.nativelabs.org/ and sign in
[20:30:08] <doug65536> p3rror: 404 error
[20:31:41] <doug65536> p3rror: that link doesn't work
[20:32:24] <doug65536> p3rror: did you mean this: http://dev.nativelabs.org/index.php
[20:32:32] <p3rror> doug65536, nop check now
[20:32:44] <doug65536> k, works now
[20:32:51] <p3rror> doug65536, and click on sign in I need to remove this pink block
[20:33:24] <doug65536> p3rror: do you have a test name and password for me to try? what do I do to remove it?
[20:34:05] <doug65536> p3rror: doing $('.alert').hide() in the console hid it
[20:34:10] <samholmes> If I include jQuery into a script that's enclosed in it's own closure, will it leak into the global namespace?
[20:35:00] <Snerf> p3rror, add display:none to the css for .alert-danger, .alert-error
[20:35:20] <doug65536> Snerf: why?
[20:35:36] <Snerf> why not?
[20:36:15] <tw2113> hide by default, show when necessary
[20:37:14] <doug65536> p3rror: in your initialization code, yoy have $('.alert').hide(); commented out. why?
[20:37:23] <Snerf> I dont see a problem with it at all.. normaly you dont show error divs by default anyways
[20:38:01] <doug65536> p3rror: yeah, hiding it wouldn't hurt. the startup code has it there, commented out
[20:39:04] <Snerf> he went awol
[20:40:37] <p3rror> hey doug65536
[20:40:43] <p3rror> sorry I was disconnected
[20:40:51] <doug65536> p3rror: hey
[20:41:42] <p3rror> doug65536, when you click on sign in you see a pink block
[20:42:03] <doug65536> why is $('.alert').hide() commented out? you could uncomment that or do what Snerf suggested, put display:none; in .alert in css
[20:42:05] <doug65536> p3rror: yes
[20:42:06] <p3rror> doug65536, there where I will write my error message if the the user can not login in
[20:42:15] <doug65536> p3rror: yes I saw that
[20:42:35] <utroda> I have a list of li elements, that when clicked expand, when they expand I want the page to scroll to the top of that li element. This is what I'm using, http://paste.laravel.com/Lxl but it only seems to work for the first li
[20:42:45] <utroda> any thoughts?
[20:43:35] <doug65536> utroda: that is not even close to enough code to see what's wrong
[20:44:01] <utroda> okay just a sec
[20:44:39] <tieTYT> hi, every time I put an .on("click" on an element, it adds a new one.  How can I overwrite the one that's currently there instead?
[20:45:07] <doug65536> tieTYT: make your callback a separate function, and use .off before you attach the new one with .on
[20:45:47] <p3rror> doug65536, the alert is not displayed at all
[20:45:49] <tieTYT> doug65536: there's no easier way?  Like a setHandler function?
[20:45:51] <doug65536> tieTYT: http://jsfiddle.net/FgM76/11/
[20:46:06] <p3rror> doug65536, I've added display:none; to css
[20:46:43] <doug65536> tieTYT: there is a way to make "one shot" event handlers that self-detach the first time it happens. is that what you want?
[20:47:30] <tieTYT> no that won't work.  I'm making a game and it has an inventory screen.  Every time that screen is presented I'm adding the on "click" to it
[20:47:46] <tieTYT> so the second time I view the screen, it has 2 event handlers on all the click actions
[20:48:06] <doug65536> tieTYT: then make your function a real function (not an anonymous inline one) and pass the name of it to .off then reattach with .on
[20:48:11] <doug65536> tieTYT: it's not that hard
[20:48:49] <tieTYT> is there an easy way to say, "remove all clicks nested under this div"?
[20:48:49] <doug65536> tieTYT: either that or don't keep attaching another handler
[20:49:06] <tieTYT> ok, thanks
[20:49:18] <p3rror> doug65536, ca you help me =)
[20:49:47] <doug65536> tieTYT: yes, $('#somediv').contents().off();
[20:50:09] <tieTYT> wouldn't  $('#somediv').contents().off("click"); be better?
[20:51:01] <doug65536> p3rror: now that it is initially hidden, you need to explicitly show it when you want it to show
[20:51:18] <doug65536> tieTYT:  $('#somediv').contents().off("click", "**"); is what the documentation says
[20:51:27] <tieTYT> ok
[20:51:41] <tieTYT> let me try that, thanks a lot
[20:51:49] <doug65536> tieTYT: np
[20:52:30] <tieTYT> ugh, "didn't work"
[20:52:30] <doug65536> tieTYT: if that gives you trouble, "contents()" might be too much. let me know if it doesn't work
[20:53:02] <tieTYT> they're still firing twice
[20:53:25] <tieTYT> i'll see what happens with just "off
[20:53:35] <doug65536> tieTYT: try .find("*").off('click', '**');
[20:53:42] <tieTYT> that worked
[20:53:59] <tieTYT> I don't mind just using off.  That may prevent me from shooting myself in the foot anyway
[20:54:04] <p3rror> doug65536, OK it's worked thank you
[20:54:12] <tieTYT> i did: $("##{dialogId}").contents().off()
[20:54:22] <tieTYT> (coffeescript)
[20:55:03] <doug65536> tieTYT: I'm curious, why do you detach and attach handlers?
[20:55:25] <samholmes> How do I add stylesheet declarations using jQuery?
[20:55:28] <doug65536> tieTYT: you need to change the event.data or something?
[20:55:46] <doug65536> samholmes: append a style tag to the body
[20:55:56] <samholmes> doug65536: I see
[20:56:15] <samholmes> or the head?
[20:56:18] <utroda> doug65536: give this a try http://jsfiddle.net/U7Xfp/
[20:56:43] <doug65536> samholmes: you explicitly want to create new style names right? you can change the css on elements more easily
[20:56:49] <tieTYT> doug65536: because it's a game.  Now imagine that the user gets an item which gives them more inventory space.  In that situation, I need to render the inventory grid with more cells
[20:56:50] <doug65536> class names*
[20:57:08] <tieTYT> and each cell should have on "click" events
[20:57:16] <doug65536> tieTYT: you're doing it wrong
[20:57:17] <samholmes> doug65536: I want to write a declaration in case new elements get added to the page with the class name
[20:57:21] <tieTYT> doug65536: what should I do?
[20:57:36] <doug65536> tieTYT: put a click handler on the parent of all those elements...
[20:57:49] <tieTYT> but then how will I know which one is clicked?
[20:57:55] <doug65536> tieTYT: make you event handler take a parameter (I call it event), then the thing they clicked is in event.target
[20:58:17] <tieTYT> oh I see
[20:58:47] <tieTYT> so event.target always refers to the most nested element that was clicked on?
[20:59:03] <tieTYT> is that what jquery does for me, or do I have to set that up?
[20:59:14] <doug65536> $('#bag_container').on('click', '.bagslot', function(event) { var element = $(event.target); <--- element is the bag slot they clicked. I also filter the events to only be from things with class="bagslot"
[20:59:22] <doug65536> tieTYT: yes
[21:00:32] <doug65536> tieTYT: it is far more efficient to handle events this way
[21:01:25] <tieTYT> but how do I know that it's the 10th bagslot?
[21:01:40] <tieTYT> give it an additional attribute I can look for like an id named #bagslot-1 ?
[21:01:46] <tieTYT> err, -10
[21:01:47] <doug65536> you can add another parameter after '.bagslot' and that value will be in event.data
[21:02:08] <doug65536> tieTYT: ah
[21:02:26] <doug65536> tieTYT: I see... there are multiple ways to handle that
[21:03:04] <tieTYT> ah ok
[21:03:13] <tieTYT> well i'll look into it.  Thanks a lot, I appreciate all the help
[21:03:13] <doug65536> tieTYT: element.parent().find('.bagslot').index(element)  <-- gives you 8 if it's the 8th bag slot
[21:03:45] <tieTYT> i gotta go now
[21:03:51] <tieTYT> i'll bbl though, thanks again
[21:03:54] <doug65536> np
[21:04:33] <doug65536> samholmes: yeah the head probably works too. I haven't tried that
[21:07:01] <utroda> doug65536: when you have a sec, can you take a peak at this http://jsfiddle.net/U7Xfp/
[21:08:24] <doug65536> utroda: http://jsfiddle.net/U7Xfp/2/
[21:08:33] <doug65536> utroda: used e.target instead of this
[21:09:07] <utroda> it still doesn't work for items further in the list
[21:09:10] <doug65536> utroda: 'this' isn't what got the click, it is where the event is bound.
[21:09:17] <doug65536> utroda: yes it does
[21:09:34] <utroda> humm... not on my end
[21:09:46] <doug65536> ah, it doesn't always work. looking
[21:10:00] <utroda> looks like it works for the first one clicked
[21:10:08] <utroda> but not the following
[21:11:53] <Whirl3d> utroda, that's because you can't scroll to the position of some elements if they are taller than scrollHeight
[21:12:41] <Whirl3d> unless you pad the bottom of the scrolling div with blank space so that the lowest div reaches the top
[21:14:34] <utroda> but shouldn't it at least work for the first few, if you click repo 2, it scrolls but repo 3 doesn't make it to the top
[21:15:40] <Whirl3d> plus you have to wait for it to expand to scroll it. otherwise the height is wrong
[21:16:05] <utroda> i can bind to the transition
[21:16:14] <utroda> then scroll
[21:18:52] <utroda> if i do this, i get the same issue tho, http://jsfiddle.net/AhE5a/
[21:22:49] <Whirl3d> look at this version: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/U7Xfp/15/
[21:23:01] <doug65536> utroda: you get multiple transitions
[21:23:01] <Whirl3d> Their positions take scrollTop into consideration
[21:24:20] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/U7Xfp/16/
[21:24:25] <utroda> whirl3d: wow thats weird
[21:24:31] <Whirl3d> notice when I scroll the pos.top changes
[21:25:04] <utroda> yeah
[21:25:32] <utroda> I just never had this happen before its kinda weird. I'm not sure on how to fix this.
[21:25:32] <Whirl3d> change ul.repos to position:absolute and they don't do that
[21:26:22] <utroda> if tho they don't do that the behavior is still as if they are
[21:26:28] <utroda> *even tho
[21:26:39] <doug65536> utroda: I think I have a solution
[21:30:29] <scar> i dont want to use facebook's login button api-- im trying to run a simple FB.login() function with an .on('click') and it won't run. i either get no trigger response or an error saying it was called before FB.init()
[21:30:48] <scar> is there a way to have my own class trigger to call FB.login()?
[21:32:19] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/U7Xfp/16/
[21:32:36] <Whirl3d> shows the disparity between scrollTop and offset().top
[21:35:38] <Whirl3d> you need position() not offset
[21:36:30] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/U7Xfp/17/    closer
[21:37:53] <utroda> yeah totally getting there
[21:38:52] <utroda> didn't look at position
[21:39:37] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/U7Xfp/19/
[21:40:30] <doug65536> I eliminated the transition and the height animation and still it is scrolling dumb. almost works http://jsfiddle.net/AhE5a/20/
[21:41:18] <Whirl3d> offset is relative to the page, whereas position is relative to the ancestor closest that is positioned absolute
[21:41:42] <utroda> Whirl3d: whats the use for collapseheight
[21:41:53] <doug65536> mine works right every other click
[21:42:07] <doug65536> well, not even
[21:42:34] <doug65536> ah
[21:42:41] <utroda> doug65536: take a look at Whirl3d last fiddle
[21:43:14] <Whirl3d> collapseheight is used because it is one collapsed element off for some reason
[21:43:20] <doug65536> utroda: no better than mine... still scrolling to the wrong things
[21:43:41] <doug65536> it's as though it messes up the offset because of offscreen things
[21:43:46] <doug65536> position I mean
[21:45:00] <doug65536> I think this is a stage 4 problem
[21:45:16] <Whirl3d> notice that when scrollTop is 0, there's a gap between element 0 and the top...that's why I used collpasedHeight
[21:46:11] <utroda> I'm just wondering how that would work, if not all the li's are the same height when collapsed
[21:46:28] <Whirl3d> Then it should work fine as well
[21:46:57] <doug65536> no way I think I just stumbled on what's going on
[21:47:46] <utroda> whirl3d, isn't that only getting the height of the first li in the list thats no expanded?
[21:49:34] <Whirl3d> sure. Any not-expanded would have worked there. I was just fudging the gap at the top between item 0 and the scroll top
[21:49:59] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/AhE5a/25/
[21:50:52] <doug65536> weird...
[21:51:17] <doug65536> check out console output of what height is giving us: http://jsfiddle.net/AhE5a/27/
[21:52:08] <doug65536> it's like top is giving us the coordinate relative to the current scroll position
[21:52:26] <T13|sleeps> Doug, when pulling a value from an ajax request....
[21:52:58] <T13|sleeps> There is a random number in the path to my response.
[21:53:26] <T13|sleeps> How picky is the node structure?
[21:53:43] <T13|sleeps> Can I put a regex in?
[21:53:52] <doug65536> in the path to your response? not sure that makes sense
[21:54:23] <Whirl3d> utroda, you are still going to have problems with all elements whose position ().top is greater than the scrollable divs scrollheight
[21:54:57] <T13|sleeps> Path is result.query.attribs.6423647.watchers
[21:55:12] <utroda> yah, i can counter that with padding tho, i think theres a old fix of doing something like padding:999; margin:-999; overflow hidden or something
[21:55:32] <T13|sleeps> The numbet is the page number, and is always 6-8 digits
[21:55:42] <doug65536> Whirl3d: why is top giving ridiculous negative numbers?
[21:55:56] <utroda> but i just can't seem to get the concept correct, i have been working on it for a while, maybe its just been a long day
[21:56:23] <T13|sleeps> Can I do like result.query.attribs./\d{6,8}/.watchers ?
[21:56:35] <doug65536> Whirl3d: look at the console here and click around: http://jsfiddle.net/AhE5a/27/
[21:56:50] <utroda> i feel like if i did it directly on the body, and no in a div container it would work fine, but i can't do that because of the site design
[21:57:59] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: in javascript?
[21:59:04] <utroda> I'm wondering if something like this would be good, http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
[21:59:15] <utroda> i would rather not but at this point not sure what to do
[21:59:53] <doug65536> utroda: if you can figure out why position().top gives you crazy negative numbers, I think you'll have your solution
[22:00:04] <Whirl3d> doug65536, you aren't logging the height, you are logging the position.top and calling it height. but the issue is that the item that is position:absolute is where the position() is measured from
[22:00:23] <doug65536> Whirl3d: I know what I'm logging. that's the name of the variable from the original fiddle
[22:01:15] <doug65536> Whirl3d: ok, so the "position" ends up negative because we're scrolled down. that makes sense
[22:01:24] <doug65536> Whirl3d: so why not compensate for that
[22:01:54] <doug65536> Whirl3d: I have an idea...
[22:02:32] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/AhE5a/28/
[22:03:13] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/AhE5a/31/
[22:03:47] <doug65536> mine works better I think
[22:04:18] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/AhE5a/34/
[22:04:46] <Whirl3d> doug65536, click on the active element
[22:04:47] <doug65536> Whirl3d: every other click jumps to the top. mine compensates for the current scroll position
[22:04:53] <utroda> I think this one right here is working correctly - http://jsfiddle.net/AhE5a/31/
[22:05:54] <utroda> you guys agree?
[22:06:32] <doug65536> utroda: yes that's the edit I made - to take into account the crazy negative numbers
[22:06:35] <Whirl3d> nope
[22:06:38] <T13|sleeps> Loadinh on laptop... link to api resul and jsfiddle shortly doug65536
[22:06:43] <Whirl3d> click on the active one
[22:06:47] <Whirl3d> and it's so bouncy
[22:06:51] <doug65536> utroda: I calculated the distance from the top of the whole thing to the top of the one you click
[22:07:04] <Whirl3d> 6 and 7 dom't work either
[22:07:38] <utroda> 6 and 7 work on my end
[22:07:51] <doug65536> Whirl3d: the "bounce" is caused by it removing the expansion then scrolling again
[22:07:54] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/U7Xfp/19/ looks better for sure
[22:09:43] <doug65536> Whirl3d: try repo 5
[22:10:41] <T13> doug65536: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=info&format=json&inprop=watchers&titles=User%3ATechnical_13 returns http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox#action=query&prop=info&format=json&inprop=watchers&titles=User%3ATechnical_13

[22:11:02] <T13> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/ArA5C/ is my fiddle... I just want to get the value of watchers
[22:11:40] <T13|sleeps> Still here
[22:12:22] <Whirl3d> collapseHeight is the padding on the .is-scrollable div
[22:13:35] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: yes, almost done
[22:15:21] <T13|sleeps> I may parse multiple pages with that eventually....  how do I make the number in the path insignificant?

[22:17:56] <T13|sleeps> 1am here... I'll look in the morning and figure it out. :)
[22:18:24] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: http://jsfiddle.net/ArA5C/1/
[22:19:50] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: I could make it more pick too...
[22:19:54] <doug65536> picky*
[22:20:11] <T13|sleeps> More picky how?
[22:20:40] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: this one will strictly find a bunch of numbers http://jsfiddle.net/ArA5C/2/
[22:21:12] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: so if some other thing suddenly gets returned, it'll grab the numbers one
[22:21:25] <utroda> thanks for the help guys, i'm out for the night, will jump on it in the morning and let you know if i figure it out with a fresh mind
[22:21:39] <doug65536> utroda: thanks for hard problem :)
[22:22:00] <utroda> I'll have to buy you guys some coffee or a beer
[22:22:01] <T13|sleeps> What I'll end up doing once I get the value, is make a global var and store it.  Then I can use the value for otherstuff.
[22:23:55] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: is it possible for those numbers to occur more than once?
[22:24:04] <T13|sleeps> I want to add the number of watchers to my http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Technical_13/common.js bottom script that gives me my system's info.
[22:24:38] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: maybe we should make it go through each number and sum them
[22:24:39] <T13|sleeps> In the path?  No, it's a static page I'd number in yhe mw database
[22:25:00] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: "pages" seems plural to me
[22:25:10] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: is it just a fluke that there's one?
[22:25:38] <T13|sleeps> Huh?
[22:26:02] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: trust me... 1 sec
[22:26:15] <T13|sleeps> lol kk /3/
[22:27:11] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: http://jsfiddle.net/ArA5C/3/
[22:27:36] <doug65536> so if that object ever has more than one of those ids, it will sum the watchers from each one
[22:27:52] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/ArA5C/4/
[22:28:42] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: ^
[22:28:50] <T13|sleeps> I see
[22:29:18] <T13|sleeps> I'll look at all 4 in morning. 1:30 am and I'm crashin
[22:31:23] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: good night
[23:18:02] <jarray52> What could cause an event binding to dissappear after a form submission?
[23:28:37] <Whirl3d> so, when you use $.next() to select the next element in a group of elements and there is no next element, it returns a 0-length jquery object. How do I return the first object? Will .first() work without context?
