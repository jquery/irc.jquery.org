[00:02:00] <Whirl3d_> jrockjiggz, is it possible that you don't need to sort the elements, but rather just need to detach and append the clicked element to the end.
[00:02:12] <Whirl3d_> which is really facilitated by appending it to the end
[00:03:47] <Whirl3d_> $("a").click(function (e) {e.preventDefault(); $(this).closest(".row").appendTo($(this).closest(".groupLeft"));})
[00:04:50] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/XMCn3/5/
[00:06:36] <jrockjiggz> hmmm looking
[00:11:43] <Rinthe> how do i only show a link when user is scrolled down? I already have the link hidden with css
[00:12:33] <mac_nibblet> Rinthe, document.scrollTop
[00:12:57] <Rinthe> mac_nibblet i know how to scroll top
[00:13:03] <Rinthe> i want the link to show only when its scrolled
[00:13:12] <Rinthe> im gussing i should use the .on()
[00:13:14] <Rinthe> but which event?
[00:14:12] <tw2113> scroll
[00:14:22] <mac_nibblet> Rinthe, http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[00:15:08] <tw2113> attach the scroll event to on() and inside, check the offset to how far down you want the user to be before it shows
[00:19:12] <Rinthe> mac_nibblet: still not sure which to use :/
[00:19:22] <mac_nibblet> scroll
[00:19:27] <mac_nibblet> check the event info
[00:19:30] <Rinthe> check on scroll?
[00:19:57] <mac_nibblet> $(document).scroll(function(evt) { console.log(evt); ));
[00:19:59] <Rinthe> let me try
[00:20:01] <mac_nibblet> just start witht that
[00:20:05] <mac_nibblet> i have never tried myself
[00:21:28] <mac_nibblet> Does anyone know how to access the autocomplete menu from outside the widget?
[00:22:53] <Rinthe> mac_nibblet: http://pastebin.com/j3QVXJav
[00:23:13] <mac_nibblet> what oviously wont work
[00:23:19] <Rinthe> ya it iddnt haha
[00:23:20] <mac_nibblet> s/what/that
[00:23:40] <tw2113> make a fiddle
[00:23:43] <Rinthe> huh?
[00:23:45] <Rinthe> im bad at this
[00:23:50] <mac_nibblet> just do what i wrote and see what information you can get from evt
[00:23:53] <tw2113> jsfiddle.net
[00:25:00] <jrockjiggz> Whirl3d_:  Funny, i had first created exactly what you wrote, but then it wasn't working.. your example actually helped me realize where i was going wrong :) thanks - if your interested, http://jsfiddle.net/XMCn3/7/
[00:26:20] <Whirl3d_> jrockjiggz, wanna see the best way to do it? gimme one sec
[00:27:17] <Rinthe> mac_nibblet: http://pastebin.com/HmN3PZC6
[00:27:21] <Rinthe> thanks it worked
[00:27:36] <mac_nibblet> :)
[00:27:54] <jrockjiggz> Whirl3d_: I actually also got it working using an array: http://jsfiddle.net/XMCn3/6/
[00:28:23] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/XMCn3/9/
[00:28:56] <Whirl3d_> uses one handler and one binding. This way if you add rows or remove rows, you are still taken care of.
[00:29:36] <jrockjiggz> nice, i'll see if it works
[00:31:02] <jrockjiggz> nice :) it works
[00:31:33] <jrockjiggz> huge win, thank you :)
[00:33:12] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/XMCn3/11/
[00:33:31] <Whirl3d_> Shows how you can add rows dynamically without having to worry about adding event handlers.
[00:35:25] <jrockjiggz> haha yes, thats my whole thing. Its for a tab system where too many tabs will wrap onto the next line, and the active tab will drop that row of tabs to the bottom against the viewport, exactly how windows handles tabs.
[00:36:27] <Whirl3d_> how windows handles tabs?
[00:38:55] <jrockjiggz> yea.. not sure if I can find an example.

[01:16:10] <multiHYP> hi
[01:16:21] <multiHYP> how can I have a selector that covers its children too?
[01:16:36] <multiHYP> $("div.login *") doesn't do the trick?
[01:16:38] <aro> $('#selector *');
[01:16:47] <aro> should
[01:17:21] <multiHYP> I am trying to say if clicked anything from the background div but "anything" from this foreground div then do something.
[01:18:05] <multiHYP> http://pastebin.com/hP6sU3wq
[01:18:20] <aro> i dont understand
[01:18:22] <multiHYP> does it make sense?
[01:18:24] <multiHYP> hm
[01:18:26] <aro> no, not at all
[01:18:48] <multiHYP> 2 divs, background covering the entire page, and a foreground div containing the login form
[01:19:26] <multiHYP> now if its visible and user clicks: if its not a click on the foreground div i.e. clicked on the background div then fadeout.
[01:19:57] <aro> how the F is a foreground div the background
[01:19:57] <multiHYP> like screenshot gallery does full screen shots.
[01:20:00] <aro> oh
[01:20:08] <aro> hmm
[01:20:14] <multiHYP> well the foreground div is nested inside the background div.
[01:20:17] <aro> ok
[01:20:22] <aro> thats simple
[01:21:09] <aro> set up a jsfiddle
[01:21:26] <multiHYP> can you tell me what your solution entails?
[01:21:55] <multiHYP> do you want to separate the two divs?
[01:22:09] <aro> www.jsfiddle.net
[01:22:11] <aro> set up a test case
[01:22:16] <aro> im not creating the test case for you
[01:22:21] <aro> ill fix it, but not create it
[01:23:31] <oDesk>  http://jsfiddle.net/V8mzM/3/   why the min and max time here is not perfect, anyone ?
[01:24:30] <aro> oDesk: what do you mean
[01:24:33] <aro> what is 'perfect'
[01:25:03] <oDesk> when you move the slider, the time is not 12:00
[01:26:11] <multiHYP> aro: http://jsfiddle.net/pyyPP/
[01:26:39] <aro> multiHYP: i dont see your divs
[01:26:42] <multiHYP> its not showing properly though, not sure what error i added in jsfiddle.
[01:26:42] <aro> how do i know where to click
[01:26:57] <multiHYP> it should show, but it doesn't
[01:26:58] <aro> you have the library set as mootools
[01:27:07] <multiHYP> :D
[01:27:08] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/pyyPP/1/
[01:27:15] <aro> hold on
[01:27:35] <aro> omg
[01:27:38] <multiHYP> http://jsfiddle.net/pyyPP/
[01:28:05] <multiHYP> no yes your link is the right one
[01:28:42] <multiHYP> now whenever I click on anything in the div.login it fades out. but that was not my intention.
[01:28:50] <aro> hold on
[01:30:13] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/pyyPP/2/
[01:30:14] <aro> try that
[01:31:23] <multiHYP> no, still if you click on anything inside the foreground div, then it fades out.
[01:31:43] <aro> no it doesnt
[01:31:44] <multiHYP> I want to exclusively fadeout only when user clicks on the black background.
[01:31:53] <aro> oh
[01:31:55] <aro> i see
[01:31:56] <aro> hang on
[01:31:59] <multiHYP> click on the white area or blue edge.
[01:32:37] <aro> hold on
[01:32:42] <aro> small error
[01:33:31] <multiHYP> http://jsfiddle.net/pyyPP/3/
[01:33:38] <multiHYP> solved it, but thanks are!
[01:33:40] <multiHYP> *aro
[01:33:48] <multiHYP> looks good
[01:34:18] <aro> np
[01:35:31] <oDesk> aro, have you tried my fiddle ?
[01:40:02] <multiHYP> hm, are my solution does not work at all. could you fix the 2nd version that still worked to some extend?
[01:40:06] <multiHYP> http://jsfiddle.net/pyyPP/2/
[01:45:13] <multiHYP> well that didn't work. :(
[01:50:21] <saschagehlich> multiHYP: what's the problem?
[01:51:01] <multiHYP> that jsfiddle #2 above doesn't work. I want to exclusively fadeOut everything only when the user clicks on the black background
[01:51:03] <Whirl3d_> multiHYP, you can refer to the the div.loginBackground as $(this) within your on... handler
[01:53:48] <multiHYP> saschagehlich: do you understand what I mean?
[01:54:11] <saschagehlich> so you want to fade out your login if the user clicks out of the login window?
[01:54:19] <multiHYP> yes
[01:54:37] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/pyyPP/9/
[01:54:47] <multiHYP> now it works but if you click on .login's white background or blue edge it still fades out.
[01:55:18] <multiHYP> exactly!
[01:55:50] <multiHYP> thanks Whirl3d_ that $(e.target) is new to me. seems to be casting as a comparable object element.
[01:56:20] <Whirl3d_> Just handle the click event on the body and check if the target's closest .login exists (by checking the length>0)  if it does, do whatever. If it  doesn't fade it out
[01:57:10] <Whirl3d_> e.target is the dom element that received the click.
[01:57:57] <Whirl3d_> $(e.target) give you access to jquery methods on the dom element by wrapping it in jquery. Then you can use the .closest() method to check if it's a decendant of ".login"
[01:58:11] <multiHYP> well I do my checks on div.background to avoid bubbling up, didn't know e.preventDefault either.
[01:58:31] <multiHYP> very nice. thanks again. :)
[01:58:57] <coldhead> great work everyone, take 5
[01:59:19] <Whirl3d_> np. Sorry I couldn't help earlier.
[01:59:51] <Rickardo1> How do I bind a plugin  e.g slider() to elements created after page is loaded? If I use live() and mouseover I bind it every time mouse moves?
[02:01:08] <Whirl3d_> Rickardo1, chances are you need to bind the slider to a parent element of the elements you want to slide. So if you are loading elements into a div, bind it to the div. Just don't bind it to any element that gets replaces when loading
[02:01:30] <Whirl3d_> *replaced...
[02:01:34] <Rickardo1> Whirl3d_: TY.. :D
[02:02:32] <Whirl3d_> 8)
[02:11:45] <aro> has anyone had any success with the infinite scroll plugin?
[02:19:52] <aro> how the F does it work? why does it keep loading the last item over and over?
[02:28:03] <coldhead> aro: it's optimised to work with wordpress
[02:28:16] <coldhead> if its loading the same item repeatedly its probably misconfigured
[02:28:33] <coldhead> its semi-abandoned, it might be easier to write one yourself :P
[02:41:20] <Whirl3d_> aro, the way infinite scroll works is that when you get to the last image, it loads the first image and adds it to the end.
[02:41:54] <Whirl3d_> then, when the last image (identical to the first image) is displayed, they shift the entire slide back to the first image and you don't notice it.
[02:42:22] <Whirl3d_> so having the same image at the beginning and the end is critical to infinite scroll.
[02:43:50] <Whirl3d_> if they didn't duplicate the first image, there would be an obvious gap at the end of the slides. Or you would have to slide backwards to the beginning---not really giving you that  infinite feel.
[02:45:15] <aro> im having a problem
[02:45:26] <aro> it keeps loading the 'next' page over and over, which is the last page
[02:45:30] <aro> i dont know why
[02:45:36] <Whirl3d> how many pages do you have?
[02:45:52] <aro> there are two pages of results in this case
[02:45:58] <Whirl3d> that's why
[02:46:02] <aro> ...why?
[02:46:09] <Whirl3d> you can't really do infinite scroll with two pages
[02:46:16] <aro> erm
[02:46:22] <aro> why?
[02:46:26] <aro> thats silly
[02:46:39] <aro> if a user filters a result set, it could be any number
[02:46:40] <Whirl3d> because you would have to load page one, page two, page one again..
[02:46:47] <aro> it should degarade gracefully
[02:47:02] <Whirl3d> no you should develop a better solution
[02:47:15] <Whirl3d> it wasn't meant for what youare trying to do
[02:47:16] <aro> in terms of what?
[02:47:20] <Whirl3d> you want cycle
[02:47:27] <aro> lol
[02:47:27] <aro> no
[02:47:29] <aro> not cycle
[02:47:38] <Whirl3d> the cycle plugin would allow you to do that better than infinite scroll..
[02:47:48] <aro> maybe you dont know what i am talking about
[02:47:49] <Whirl3d> there is little to no scrolling with one or two images.
[02:48:06] <Whirl3d> right, or maybe you don't know what you're talking about...
[02:48:07] <aro> in fact, now i am certain you dont
[02:48:17] <aro> no, i am pretty sure i know what i am talking about
[02:48:28] <aro> https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll
[02:48:35] <aro> tell me if thats what you are talking about
[02:48:42] <aro> or if you are talking about something completely different
[02:49:43] <Whirl3d> I am very familiar with infinite scroll
[02:49:58] <aro> then why on gods green earth are you telling me to use the cycle plugin
[02:50:10] <aro> this is for pagination control
[02:50:13] <aro> not a gallery
[02:51:23] <Whirl3d> cycle can be configured to scroll content...it's basic function is pagination
[02:51:42] <Whirl3d> it cycles through pages
[02:51:45] <aro> paginating what
[02:51:55] <Whirl3d> it's the most basic example of pagination I could think of
[02:51:56] <aro> which cycle plugin are you talking about
[02:52:06] <Whirl3d> ? cycle
[02:52:08] <bot-t> Whirl3d, Cycle - jQuery plugin repository - Easy to use slideshow implementation. It supports pause-on-hover, auto-stop, auto-fit, before/after callbacks, click triggers and many, many transition effects including fade, shuffle, scroll, turn... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/cycle
[02:52:27] <aro> thats what i was thinking of too, but ive never used that for paginating
[02:52:40] <aro> this is not a case where i would use cycle
[02:53:26] <Whirl3d> Then you got it all figure out. Keep trying to use a really old WordPress plugin for something that it wasn't intended and keep wondering why it's not working. No skin off my teeth
[02:53:44] <aro> really old?
[02:53:52] <aro> it was updated 2 days ago
[02:53:55] <Whirl3d> 2005

[03:02:51] <Space-Duck> Can this be optimized? http://jsfiddle.net/mELwL/1/
[03:02:56] <kvarley> Does Javascript take precedence over HTML links?
[03:03:05] <aro> kvarley: what do you mean?
[03:03:08] <aro> in what sense?
[03:03:31] <jcubic> aro: you can use cycle for pagination of number of pages is small
[03:03:43] <kvarley> aro: As in when a user clicks a link does it go to the href location first or does it run the javascript on the link onClick method first?
[03:03:48] <jcubic> s/of/if
[03:03:58] <aro> kvarley: did you try it and see?
[03:04:08] <aro> jcubic: it says nothing about that on the page
[03:04:21] <Space-Duck> kvarley, only when the JS returns false. Otherwise the link will process after the JS
[03:04:41] <kvarley> Space-Duck: Does that rule apply in all browsers or just the good ones?
[03:04:50] <aro> all browsers
[03:05:01] <aro> unless its a text based one or something that has JS disabled
[03:05:03] <aro> obviously
[03:05:08] <jcubic> kvarley: you can also call event.preventDefault() returing false also call event.stopPropagation()
[03:05:27] <aro> jcubic: you dont need to call stopPropagation for that
[03:05:37] <aro> thats to prevent shit from bubbling up the DOM tree
[03:05:46] <aro> (ie: other JS listeners)
[03:05:51] <kvarley> aro: Thanks, my idea will work then. I have permalinks as href locations but I want data to be fetched via ajax if they have js enabled =]
[03:05:58] <jcubic> aro:  yes I know but when you return false it will be called
[03:06:10] <aro> preventDefault(); or return false; will be fine
[03:06:31] <aro> jcubic: what will be called?
[03:06:35] <jcubic> return false == preventDefault + stopPropagate
[03:06:59] <aro> no, return false = return false
[03:09:56] <aro> well
[03:10:01] <aro> ill be god damned, i stand corrected
[03:10:18] <aro> jcubic: sorry, my mind was stuck in 2010
[03:10:19] <jcubic> aro: http://jsfiddle.net/X2JsB/
[03:10:25] <aro> you are right, it does call it
[03:10:45] <aro> whats that
[03:11:28] <aro> i just modified the JS core to add a log when stopPropagation() is called...
[03:11:29] <jcubic> prove that retun false != return false
[03:11:42] <aro> your example doesnt really prove that
[03:11:56] <jcubic> events are attached to element and is parents
[03:12:11] <jcubic> and on return false event for parent is not triggered
[03:12:30] <Whirl3d> http://css-tricks.com/infinite-all-css-scrolling-slideshow/
[03:13:17] <jcubic> do you know where can I find information about this bot-t irc bot?
[03:13:33] <jcubic> ?whoaim
[03:13:34] <bot-t> jcubic, Couldn't find "whoaim" in jQuery Docs.
[03:14:04] <aro> Whirl3d: what is that supposed to be? a looping gallery?
[03:15:15] <aro> the fact that it is obfuscated doesnt make it a valid point
[03:15:30] <aro> however, when i inspect it using fiddler, i can see that it is NOT paginating - it is preloaded content
[03:15:35] <aro> therefore your case is void
[03:16:00] <aro> and my point stands, that cycle is not used for paginating, but cycling preloaded content
[03:17:09] <Whirl3d> aro, you suck, man. Figure it out yourself. Anyone who thinks that you can have infinite scrolling with two content items is missing the point of infinite scrolling..
[03:17:44] <aro> lol
[03:17:51] <aro> apparently you are still misunderstanding what i am doing
[03:18:08] <Whirl3d> Infinite scrolling means you continually load new content or you cycle content...havingt two pieces of content doesn't constitute infinite scrolling.
[03:18:17] <aro> go read up on what pagination is
[03:18:24] <aro> then maybe i can get my point across
[03:18:25] <coldhead> moebius scrolling?
[03:18:37] <Whirl3d> even in the plugin it says: "congrats you have reached the end of the internet" if you get to the end of your infinitely scolling content
[03:18:49] <aro> yeah, so?
[03:19:04] <Whirl3d> not exactly infinite is it?
[03:19:14] <aro> take it up with paul irish
[03:19:17] <aro> hes the one that wrote it
[03:19:32] <aro> the *logic* behind it is that it is the name awarded to it by google
[03:19:35] <Whirl3d> he didn't write it for paginating two pages
[03:19:53] <aro> you are absolutely insane
[03:20:01] <aro> results can be variable
[03:20:12] <aro> ie: 2 pages, or 30 pages, or 1,304 pages
[03:20:31] <aro> you are implying that i write a separate piece of logic depending on how many pages of results there are
[03:20:52] <Whirl3d> or simple repeat the content from the beginning like most infinite scrollers do
[03:21:03] <aro> LOL
[03:21:07] <Whirl3d> until new content is loaded
[03:21:07] <aro> forget it
[03:21:19] <aro> apparently you have no clue what pagination is
[03:21:20] <Whirl3d> that's why it keeps loading your same content over and over.
[03:21:34] <aro> no, its not looping my content.
[03:21:38] <Whirl3d> you have no clue what infinite means, apparently
[03:21:41] <joaojeronimo> When I'm looking for an ID, it's supposed to exist only one element with that ID on the page... Why does $("#myElement") return an array of the elements with that ID ? Why doesn't it just return the one ? Am I missing something ? What's the reason for this behavior ?
[03:22:20] <Whirl3d> joaojeronimo, it returns a jquery collection (which looks a lot like an array, but has more features)
[03:22:30] <aro> heres an example: I have a page that has 14 pages of results. It goes through pages 1, 2, 3 all the way through 14 fine. But then it loads page 14 over and over and over and over. It SHOULD just stop.
[03:23:14] <Whirl3d> where is your friggin code?
[03:23:36] <Whirl3d> and if it just stops, what's infinite about it?
[03:23:54] <joaojeronimo> Whirl3d, like shortcuts for other functions and stuff ? Do you happen to know if $("#someInputinAForm")[0].value is the correct way to get the value of an input, or is there some shortcut ?
[03:23:56] <Whirl3d> an infinite scroller is designed to not stop scrolling/
[03:24:14] <aro> like i said, take it up with paul
[03:24:16] <aro> https://gist.github.com/3070382
[03:24:22] <Whirl3d> $("#someting").val() will do it
[03:24:25] <coldhead> aro: the selector for the "next" page is probably something like nextSelector : "div.navigation a:first"
[03:24:37] <coldhead> and i bet that matches wrongly on the last page
[03:24:53] <aro> coldhead: i did set it correctly, i even created the custom function to parse the URL.
[03:24:55] <coldhead> you probably need to change the selector to exclude that last link somehow
[03:25:00] <aro> However, the script is designed to only do that once
[03:25:13] <aro> it has a parsing mechanism based on the number of results it sees in the page
[03:25:14] <joaojeronimo> thanks Whirl3d !
[03:26:14] <coldhead> aro: it probably uses the first link from <a>Older results</a> <a>This page</a> and on the last page there probably isn't an <a>Older results</a> so it uses <a>This page</a> as the "first" link
[03:27:08] <coldhead> i'm sure you could have figured out a fix for this in the time you spent bickering with venerable Whirl3d, a cherished member of the #jQuery community
[03:27:21] <aro> coldhead: no, it is looking explicitly for an element matching $('a.goto-next')
[03:27:33] <aro> and like i said, it only does that once - to build an array of url components
[03:27:47] <aro> and then joins them together with the internally calculated 'next' page value
[03:28:13] <coldhead> you think it's a bug in infinitescroll?
[03:28:20] <aro> could be?
[03:28:23] <coldhead> perhaps it's one of the 85 open issues :)
[03:28:28] <aro> it wasnt :)
[03:29:34] <aro> i am not discounting or discrediting Whirl3d's knowledge of jquery, just of what i am trying to do. its not my fault that paul irish named it adversely
[03:30:00] <coldhead> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9352389/jquery-infinitescroll-plugin-loads-the-last-page-over-and-over
[03:30:59] <coldhead> we're all cool, we just can't have people discouraging Whirld3d from helping or lazy slobs like me will have to do more support ourselves, and badly
[03:31:56] <coldhead> thank you for bringing the ongoing dev of infinite scroll to my attention, aro
[03:32:02] <coldhead> last i heard paul was going to retire it
[03:32:13] <aro> i think it stems from a miscommunication/understanding of what the term 'infinite' in infinite-scroll means
[03:32:14] <aro> :)
[03:32:16] <aro> no problem
[03:32:25] <Eviltwin> Uh oh, have things gone to hell in my absence?
[03:32:34] <coldhead> infinity is a big concept
[03:32:41] <coldhead> we're good, ET
[03:33:01] <Whirl3d> Hey there Eviltwin, how goes it?
[03:33:21] <Eviltwin> Busy busy busy
[03:33:55] <coldhead> having fun, Eviltwin? geting cashed up?
[03:34:08] <Eviltwin> Yes and yes
[03:37:37] <Eviltwin> This place isn't fond of jQuery for production code but I still end up using it in mockups
[03:38:02] <Whirl3d> What place is it?
[03:38:09] <Eviltwin> Facebook
[03:38:41] <Whirl3d> Cool I didn't know you were working for facebook. How is it?

[03:40:25] <Eviltwin> Free laundry via a service called Purple Tie
[03:40:29] <Renari> nvm
[03:40:32] <Renari> i'm an ididot
[03:40:42] <Renari> fixed it
[03:40:44] <Renari> wow
[03:40:53] <Renari> overlooked something so simple
[03:41:26] <_zoggy_> is the jquery build scripts documented anywhere
[03:41:56] <Eviltwin> _zoggy_: Did you checkout the source from GitHub or something?
[03:42:22] <coldhead> sweet gig, Eviltwin
[03:42:24] <_zoggy_> no doing a build script for another project
[03:43:12] <Eviltwin> coldhead: Yeah, I'm pretty happy with it.
[03:50:57] <Mohsen_Hassani> How can I create a modal window when clicking on a button?
[04:00:17] <Whirl3d> Mohsen_Hassani, one of the reasons that you most likely have not been answered is that you are asking a really open-ended question. That is to say that there are a million ways to do what you want to do. Perhaps you could ask a more specific question and you would be more likely to get a helpful response...
[04:00:31] <coldhead> Mohsen_Hassani: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#method-open
[04:01:10] <Whirl3d> or you could wait for coldhead to save the day like always. LOL either way works.
[04:01:38] <Mohsen_Hassani> Whirl3d, I need to click on a link and I want a window to pop up and with the the details about that item...
[04:02:26] <Whirl3d> Mohsen_Hassani, did you checkout the link coldhead provided. Chances are that's gonna be your best bet to get you started.
[04:03:13] <Mohsen_Hassani> coldhead, Whirl3d I'm checking the link... Thanks! :)
[04:03:36] <Zerpex> what is the jquery alternative to offsetHeight?
[04:04:24] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/height/ ?
[04:05:03] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/ ?
[04:05:10] <Zerpex> ahh thank you :D
[04:14:11] <mikkelb> Hey! :-)
[04:14:26] <Mohsen_Hassani> Whirl3d, The link coldhead provided me was using $( "#dialog" ).dialog(); but for me the .dialog() is not working.
[04:14:27] <mikkelb> Everybody feeling alright this Sunday?!
[04:14:35] <Mohsen_Hassani> Whirl3d, Do I have to download its widget or something?
[04:14:50] <Mohsen_Hassani> Whirl3d, I'm trying to build one myself, the most simple one for exercise.
[04:14:51] <mikkelb> At my dropdown menu at http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/ECB9W/17/ - what's the best way of doing a small delay if the user accidentally moves his or her mouse outside of the hit area?
[04:14:52] <mikkelb> I'm trying to replace http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[04:16:14] <Whirl3d> Mohsen_Hassani, if you want to do it for practice, here's what I suggest: Go to jsfiddle.net and set it up there. Get as far as you can get by yourself and then post the url to your fiddle back here. It's a lot better to do the work yourself for practice and learning reasons and people will be really glad to help.
[04:17:03] <Mohsen_Hassani> Whirl3d, Thanks! :) I'm going for jsfiddle.net
[04:17:06] <Whirl3d> I think that the code that coldhead provided required the use of jqueryUI.
[04:17:19] <Whirl3d> I think you'll like it. It's a great learning tool.
[04:17:31] <Mohsen_Hassani> Whirl3d, yes, I had to download it to work...
[04:17:34] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/QwWDx/1/ - how do I make the hidden #submit-post form slide down when the #new-post button is clicked?
[04:18:01] <mikkelb> Whirl3d: Have you seen that new tinkerbin thing, what do you guys feel about that one?
[04:19:17] <Whirl3d> mikkelb, lets start with the first question:   what you can do is this:in your mouseout callback, set a timeout like var t=setTimeout(hidemenu, 2000);   then in your mouseenter callback, if (t) {clearTimeout(t);}
[04:21:50] <Renari> $("#cfield_19").change(updatebubbles()); should call the updatebubbles function when cfield_19 is changed correct?
[04:22:17] <mikkelb> Whirl3d: Should I base that on my existing code or my commented code?
[04:25:20] <Mohsen_Hassani> Whirl3d, I need to use jquery in jsfiddle.net, what's the link of online jquery?
[04:25:41] <Mohsen_Hassani> Whirl3d, I mean the link I should provide for src=""
[04:25:42] <mikkelb> Mohsen_Hassani: It's built-in!
[04:25:49] <Mohsen_Hassani> oh...
[04:26:00] <mikkelb> choose it from the "Choose Framework" thingie
[04:26:27] <Mohsen_Hassani> mikkelb, Thanks! :)
[04:27:04] <monkeybite> Renari if I want to invoke a function when a div changes, how to?
[04:27:24] <monkeybite> $('#secondList').on('change', function () {
[04:27:27] <Renari> monkeybite: it's not a div, it's a selection
[04:27:27] <monkeybite> does not work
[04:27:35] <Renari> http://jsfiddle.net/np7HB/
[04:27:37] <Renari> example
[04:27:58] <monkeybite> ah ok, but if I have a div instead?
[04:28:00] <monkeybite> do u know?
[04:28:12] <Renari> um, what are you changing?
[04:28:23] <Renari> the contents of the div?
[04:28:26] <monkeybite> dragging a new li-element into a div
[04:28:27] <Whirl3d> sorry mikkelb, brb
[04:28:27] <monkeybite> yeah
[04:28:31] <monkeybite> the div contains <li>
[04:28:33] <mikkelb> Whirl3d: this is ridiculous i know but: http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/ECB9W/23/
[04:29:01] <Renari> I don't understand why you would need to call a change event on something that the user doesn't access.
[04:29:13] <monkeybite> drag and drop? :)
[04:29:14] <monkeybite> see here
[04:29:17] <monkeybite> http://jsfiddle.net/mrPX4/20/

[04:31:34] <Renari> monkeybite: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/

[04:36:38] <michelem> one possibility is the Gauge object from google charts, but it's boring for grading.
[04:42:15] <Renari> Does anyone know why $("#cfield_19").change(updatebubbles()); and $("#cfield_11").change(updatebubbles()); are never triggering here: http://jsfiddle.net/np7HB/ when the selection they are targeting is changed?
[04:42:50] <Mohsen_Hassani> Why doesn't this jquery run?
[04:42:51] <Mohsen_Hassani> http://jsfiddle.net/gBz3y/
[04:44:14] <Renari> Mohsen_Hassani: because you have mootools selected instead of jquery
[04:45:23] <Dr4g> Hey guys, I have put jquery mobile on my page, but only to use its 'orientationchange' event. It seems jQueryMobile is also hooking into the <a> tag clicks and trying to make it look like the mobile app
[04:45:34] <Dr4g> with the page fade in/out effects and such
[04:45:50] <Dr4g> I don't want all this, how can I disable jQuery mobile from doing this ?
[04:45:54] <Renari> Mohsen_Hassani: http://jsfiddle.net/gBz3y/1/
[04:46:30] <Mohsen_Hassani> Renari, Thanks! :) I didn't know I had to change it.
[04:47:03] <Posterdati> hi
[04:47:19] <Dr4g> rephrased: How does one stop jquery mobile include from attaching its 'mobile' process onto <a> tags on the page?

[04:53:18] <Whirl3d> Mohsen_Hassani, include jquery UI and it'll work for ya
[04:54:02] <Mohsen_Hassani> Whirl3d, oh :)
[04:58:28] <Whirl3d> mikkelb, like this? http://jsfiddle.net/QwWDx/9/
[04:59:01] <Posterdati> how can I attach a tooltip to an svg?
[04:59:19] <Whirl3d> lol, every day for the last week. LOL
[05:00:22] <Mohsen_Hassani> Whirl3d, What's jquery UI? Is it a file like jquery.js to be downloaded and used in my project?
[05:01:04] <Whirl3d> it's a library that uses jquery to give you some greatlooking great functioning UI items like dialogs, buttons, tabs, etc.
[05:01:10] <Whirl3d> ? jqueryUI
[05:01:11] <bot-t> Whirl3d, jQuery UI - Documentation - jQuery - This is the official documentation for jQuery UI , jQuery's visual controls. jQuery UI features a wide range of core interaction plugins as well as many UI widgets . The project homepage is located... http://docs.jquery.com/UI
[05:01:37] <Mohsen_Hassani> Whirl3d, Thanks! :)
[05:05:07] <mikkelb> Whirl3d: very much so!
[05:05:22] <mikkelb> sec though - on a weak wireless - jsfiddle won't load
[05:06:12] <Whirl3d> really? never had that problem....
[05:07:46] <mikkelb> shitty isp.. if it wasn't for the sweet swedish chicks they hire to sit at the reception, i'd have gone all breivik on them years ago
[05:08:11] <mikkelb> Whirl3d: looks excellent, thank you so much
[05:09:26] <Renari> Does anyone see something wrong with this? For some reason it's going to default on the switch even though it shouldn't be. Console says the switch value is 6 but it skips case 6 and goes to default. http://ft.trillian.im/renari/690fpmtqe-4tIFyYIybM.jpg
[05:10:38] <Renari> here's a jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/DsmVJ/
[05:12:24] <Whirl3d> try parseInt(pr4achar);
[05:12:33] <Whirl3d> or case "6"
[05:14:16] <Whirl3d> Renari, did that help?
[05:14:31] <Renari> Whirl3d: trying it now
[05:15:25] <Renari> Whirl3d: yeah that fixed it
[05:15:27] <Renari> thanks
[05:15:38] <Whirl3d> See the problem?
[05:15:55] <Renari> yeah it was reading the val as a string
[05:16:16] <Whirl3d> Cool. Just making sure. I always miss that on my own code. LOL
[05:18:21] <Renari> That was just one problem though :\ it also appears $("#cfield_11").change(updatebubbles()); isn't triggering
[05:18:45] <Whirl3d> I have a suggestion for you too...
[05:19:38] <Whirl3d> perhaps you could could setup an array with all your values and then rather than a switch statement, $("#p4abubble").attr("src", lookupValue(p4achar));
[05:20:38] <Whirl3d> so lookupValue[5]=p4abase+"Kanji/kanjib.... etc.
[05:21:48] <Whirl3d> take out the () in the callback handler
[05:22:19] <Whirl3d> in other words, $(elem).change(functionname) is different from $("elem").change(functionName())
[05:22:40] <BoMbMoNkEy> Whirl3d: ur name reminds me of the brand whirlpool
[05:23:05] <Whirl3d> by adding the () after thefunction name, you are calling the function and returning the results ...which usually isn't a function
[05:23:05] <Renari> Whirl3d: thanks
[05:23:25] <Whirl3d> You mean my sister, hate her!
[05:23:38] <mikkelb> Whirl3d: You have a sister?
[05:23:45] <Whirl3d> nah.
[05:24:05] <Whirl3d> My mother couldn't have kids after me.
[05:24:33] <mikkelb> were you like insanely big or something?
[05:24:51] <Whirl3d> Biggest baby born in Texas in 1969.
[05:25:26] <mikkelb> well congratulations =)

[05:26:30] <mikkelb> who helps me out with a fiddle but never tells me ??
[05:26:33] <Whirl3d> He finally gave up
[05:26:37] <mikkelb> ha
[05:26:40] <Whirl3d> I didn't even look at it
[05:26:56] <mikkelb> is he onto something though?
[05:27:19] <mikkelb> http://jsfiddle.net/ECB9W/22/ there might be later revisions
[05:27:31] <mikkelb> please tell your roommate i said hi
[05:27:35] <Whirl3d> I dunno I'd have to look.   there's a 30 as well.
[05:27:56] <Whirl3d> I'll ask him how far he got before giving up...lol
[05:28:21] <mikkelb> hehe
[05:28:31] <Whirl3d> He doesn't know about RUN, so he quit around 42, he said.
[05:28:39] <Whirl3d> cracks me up sometimes
[05:28:45] <mikkelb> 42????
[05:29:24] <mikkelb> Whirl3d: please give him my deepest thanks
[05:29:46] <mikkelb> Whirl3d: maybe one would be better off just using hoverintent?
[05:30:23] <Whirl3d> I like the way the commented text looks. YOu just need to add slideup and down
[05:32:14] <mikkelb> really?
[05:32:22] <mikkelb> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/ECB9W/43/ just like that?
[05:32:55] <bwq> how you guys like twitter bootstrap?
[05:40:19] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/ECB9W/48/
[05:40:49] <Whirl3d> something like that maybe. I'd have to look at it for real. I was just trying to clean up what john had started....lol
[05:41:41] <mikkelb> Whirl3d: thanks man :-)
[05:42:49] <mikkelb> im probably just gonna use hoverintent though
[05:44:01] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/ECB9W/51/   i'd probably use hoverIntent too.... here's the same mess with easing...lol
[05:44:41] <Whirl3d> I gotta grab some breakfast. I'll be back in a while. Good chattin' with ya.

[05:45:32] <mikkelb> likewise man, it's been a pleasure
[06:22:54] <Sieben> How can I get a distant JSON array ? I use $.getJSON('data.json') but I get an object but not the array
[06:25:32] <bwq> no, you got the json alright
[06:25:42] <bwq> var['var1']
[06:25:47] <bwq> just access it like that
[06:26:06] <bwq> or if you got an array with, say, results as the root element
[06:26:14] <bwq> var.results[0].msg
[06:26:15] <bwq> etc.
[06:27:48] <Sieben> $.getJSON('dvd.json')[0]
[06:27:53] <Sieben> I get undefined
[06:28:30] <bwq> what's your json look like?
[06:28:46] <bwq> don't use [0]
[06:28:53] <Sieben> http://dvd.sieben.fr/dvd.json
[06:29:02] <Sieben> It's a giant array
[06:29:13] <bwq> no root element?
[06:29:28] <Sieben> no it's just an array
[06:29:41] <bwq> yeah
[06:29:44] <bwq> hmm, not sure
[06:30:02] <bwq> i always make sure i add a proper key for an array
[06:31:10] <bwq> [0].genre works fine for me
[06:31:30] <bwq> but you're not using a callback
[06:31:35] <bwq> you can't access it like that
[06:31:59] <bwq> $.getJSON('dvd.json', function(data){
[06:32:34] <bwq> $.each(data, function(k, v){ alert(v); });
[06:32:35] <bwq> etc.
[06:33:06] <Sieben> I'm going to try that, I want to use Angular.js
[06:33:08] <bwq> or you could just alert(data[0].genre) in the callback to see how it works
[06:35:12] <Sieben> bwq, I'm trying to have a configuation close to : http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_02
[06:35:19] <Sieben> app/js/controllers.js:
[06:55:26] <osirisx11> hi, is there a cleaner way to do this? http://jsfiddle.net/BhJ9W/
[06:56:55] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/6ET8U/5/ - what I gotta do next to get one of those neat "Attach a file" thingies like Gmail?
[07:01:01] <bwq> add a whole bunch of javascript
[07:04:46] <Stephen> Gnaaaaf!
[07:05:34] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/cLXep/2/ - how do I do one of those cool tag thingies like StackOverflow? There's http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/ but it's so fucking huge - there's gotta be a better way?
[07:06:30] <Stephen> mikkelb: So, you'll need a few things
[07:06:54] <Stephen> css can handle the round tag containers
[07:07:46] <mikkelb> Stephen: yes sir, hold up i just did those actually
[07:07:46] <xarxer> having this (http://ideone.com/MUcnp) as my main.js, as you can see, all animation use the same chain of functions and time interval, the only difference is the colors.. Can I "minify" this somehow and just call a function which takes the colors as parameters?
[07:08:16] <Stephen> Create a simple text input & button to add the tags, just add them to the div visually
[07:08:58] <Stephen> Then add an onSubmit handler to the submitting form which collects all the tags in the div and dump their text into a hidden field
[07:09:42] <Stephen> xarxer: jQuery's animation suite doesn't handle animating colors very well
[07:09:57] <Stephen> It works sometimes, but their documentation states it's not supported
[07:10:17] <mikkelb> Stephen: that sounds very tricky
[07:10:22] <mikkelb> Stephen: any chance I could pay you to come up with an example?

Wehn i first drag&drop one, it stays at the drop position, but when i drag it again, it fits to the area. Here is the code, it would be perfect if someone could help me: http://jsfiddle.net/G3vG6/1/

[08:30:30] <RohanBhangui> anyone cna help
[08:31:12] <Stephen> RohanBhangui
[08:31:17] <RohanBhangui> ya
[08:31:48] <Stephen> Are you wanting only 1 element there, instead of stacking multiple?
[08:32:38] <Stephen> jQuery('<div/>', { class: 'test',}).appendTo('#container');     <---- Move this out of the function
[08:32:47] <Stephen> That's why it keeps adding new ones
[08:33:21] <RohanBhangui> okay maye i should exlpain again
[08:33:29] <RohanBhangui> say i have 3 squares
[08:33:33] <RohanBhangui> even better
[08:33:36] <RohanBhangui> 1 square
[08:33:41] <RohanBhangui> and i press click me
[08:33:51] <Stephen> If you want the stack, then you need to add the class during that line, instead of doing addClass and removeClass on $(".test")
[08:34:01] <RohanBhangui> hold let me finsh
[08:34:02] <Stephen> because that will affect ALL of your divs
[08:34:09] <RohanBhangui> ya
[08:34:09] <Stephen> K, sorry
[08:34:12] <RohanBhangui> okay i think you got it
[08:34:14] <RohanBhangui> np
[08:34:16] <RohanBhangui> you got it
[08:34:31] <RohanBhangui> so can you fix my fiddle?
[08:36:23] <RohanBhangui> btw why cant i use <div></div> instead of </div>
[08:36:29] <RohanBhangui> and if i can h wat is the difference
[08:36:29] <ircjsbot> Now when everybody and their mama use yours

[08:42:53] <GreekFreak> hi all
[08:43:19] <GreekFreak> I am having great difficulty customizing the DataTables plugin. I
[08:43:32] <GreekFreak> I'm not talking about the features, but the CSS
[08:44:48] <bjensen> what jquery date picker do you guys use for bootstrap?
[08:44:50] <GreekFreak> as soon as I add my jquery theme, things seem to go... wonky. And it seems to reject all css that I add specific to it's classes (even if it's specific or !important)
[08:47:21] <mikkelb> Stephen: my bad sorry, somebody showed up unannounce and demanded coffee etc.
[08:47:26] <mikkelb> * unannounced
[08:47:41] <Stephen> lol
[08:47:45] <Stephen> Coffee is necessary
[08:51:19] <mikkelb> Stephen: hehe
[08:52:35] <mikkelb> Stephen: looks sorta complex though, and seeing as how it only covers a fraction of the functionality needed, might it be best to go for select2 after all?
[08:55:57] <mikkelb> LukeNukem_: hey whats up lil nigga?
[08:56:06] <mikkelb> long time no see
[08:56:11] <LukeNukem_> mikalv, yeh long time
[08:56:21] <mikkelb> this kid is a LEGEND everybody, give it up for LukeNukem_ !!
[08:56:48] <mikkelb> LukeNukem_: hows your fb clone coming along?
[08:57:17] <LukeNukem_> it went pretty good, the main point of it was to learn and to check if i could do it.
[08:57:27] <LukeNukem_> I deleted the source files, it got messy. Im going to learn more now ;)
[08:57:59] <mikkelb> cool
[08:58:33] <mikkelb> yeah i know how that's like
[08:58:39] <mikkelb> i delete source files all the time
[08:58:51] <mikkelb> can't stand the thought of maintaining it..
[09:16:07] <karloboy> i have more of a logic question.... i currently have  an existing code which calls a function that runs a "synchronous" xmlhttprequest and gets the return value of it.... now we have to modify it to use "asynchronous" ajax... can anyone help me translate the existing logic?
[09:17:18] <bwq> $.ajax
[09:18:56] <karloboy> @bwq: I hope it's that easy.... say this snippet...    var result = api.LMSCommit("");      if (result != "true")      {         var err = ErrorHandler();      }
[09:20:04] <karloboy> the api.LMSCommit("")... is a function that executes a synchronous ajax call and returns  "true" or "false"
[09:20:36] <karloboy> based on the result of that synchronous ajax call
[09:21:32] <bwq> easy enough karloboy
[09:21:50] <shoky> Posterdati: cool
[09:22:11] <bwq> but uhm
[09:22:15] <bwq> that's not really a request :)
[09:22:20] <bwq> you describe a function call
[09:22:25] <bwq> not an xmlhttprequest
[09:23:22] <bwq> in an ajax request, you get data from a source and then in the callback function you do something with the received data
[09:23:41] <karloboy> hmmm i'll make a pastebin
[09:29:22] <karloboy> @bwq: http://pastebin.com/XczHDLMa
[09:30:14] <karloboy> @bwq: I'm more than happy to use jquery to replace the old code...

[09:54:00] <ura> barfoo365, write line 13 like: jQuery("#randomdiv").html('<img src="' + imgurl + '">');
[09:55:15] <barfoo365> ura : perfect, thanks :)
[09:55:20] <barfoo365> I knew i was almost there
[09:56:09] <ura> I'm happy I could help :)
[09:56:44] <jammsen> i got a string in javascript, but i want the first letter to be written big like strtoupper in php

[09:57:23] <bwq> karloboy: sorry
[09:57:37] <bwq> you can replace that part of the code entirely
[09:57:44] <bwq> the "createRequest" function
[09:57:49] <bwq> ?? $.ajax
[09:57:52] <bwq> hmm
[09:58:08] <bwq> use jquery's $.ajax call instead of the createRequest
[09:58:18] <sendoushi> hey guys
[09:58:22] <sendoushi> emberjs or angularjs?
[09:59:45] <karloboy> @bwq: ok... but how do i check on the resulting value
[10:07:43] <bwq> karloboy: the "success" is used for that

[10:12:04] <shoky> throwing the exception?
[10:12:12] <Cameron__> when i take it out it's fine
[10:12:19] <shoky> it sounds like you're doing string concatenation in the selector
[10:12:29] <Cameron__> oh jquery.min.js:3
[10:12:39] <shoky> like..   .next('.' + someElement)
[10:12:48] <Cameron__> no

[10:15:18] <shoky> it's as i said before ;p
[10:15:53] <Cameron__> no its not
[10:16:00] <shoky> 'year' is evaluated as the #year input element
[10:16:01] <shoky> yes it is
[10:16:36] <shoky> (you want $year ..)
[10:16:47] <shoky> or actually change var $year to var year
[10:16:51] <shoky> if you want to make sense.

[10:55:54] <kalleth> heya, I can't get $(element).fadeIn(800) to work properly, it doesn't actually fade in the element when it initially has style="display: none;"
[10:55:58] <kalleth> pretty sure it's my CSS
[10:55:58] <kuldeepdhaka> #JQ
[10:56:15] <kalleth> anyone take a peek for me? It's at http://viewr.multiplay.co.uk/popup# but i'll need to trigger an event to appear
[10:57:31] <kalleth> so my JS works to inject the new 'event' element into the DOM, i can see it appear in the inspector with style="display: none""
[10:57:36] <kalleth> but it then doesn't fade it in
[10:57:54] <kalleth> gotta be a z-indexy thing
[11:00:52] <kalleth> shoky: do you keep IRC logs? :)
[11:01:01] <kalleth> looking for a PM 2012-04-19 when you last fixed this for me ;)
[11:02:35] <Browser> hi everyone
[11:02:40] <jrockjiggz> Hello
[11:02:54] <shoky> kalleth: you had the same nick?
[11:03:02] <kalleth> yeah
[11:03:12] <shoky> got it ;p
[11:03:21] <kalleth> least, i cant remember if you fixed it for me or tried a couple and etc
[11:03:28] <kalleth> but it was the exact same problem
[11:04:21] <kalleth> hmm, ok, found a log somewhere else where i was chatting about it over MSN
[11:04:53] <shoky> pm'd you
[11:06:22] <shoky> Cameron__: 2nd, put it in a fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/vbFPY/
[11:06:32] <kalleth> thanks, shoky
[11:06:46] <shoky> np
[11:06:56] <kalleth> doesn't appear to be the same thing, dammit :p
[11:07:08] <shoky> sry ;p
[11:07:33] <zduffy> So if I'm reading this right, date picker may only be used with on select?
[11:08:04] <zduffy> I need to alert the user if a date is selected that is disabled, and obviously on select will not work because it won't be selected
[11:08:10] <kalleth> when you prepend an element with $("container").prepend($(myelement))
[11:08:45] <kalleth> does it prepend that exact element (so say you $("container").prepend(element) and element was a var element = $("<some html fragment>"))
[11:08:50] <kalleth> can i then continue to do $(element).fadeIn()
[11:10:12] <shoky> kalleth yeap
[11:10:33] <kalleth> hmm
[11:10:35] <kalleth> this is really weird
[11:11:02] <kalleth> ok, no idea how i'd demo this as a fiddle; can you just load up http://viewr.multiplay.co.uk/popup
[11:11:12] <kalleth> tell me when you're on it and i'll trigger an event to create a dom element that's hidden
[11:11:35] <kalleth> hmm
[11:11:35] <kalleth> nm
[11:11:38] <kalleth> i may actually have figured it out
[11:12:20] <kalleth> oh you utter bellent
[11:13:26] <kalleth> ok so my code was $("container").prepend($(element)); $(element).fadeIn()
[11:13:41] <kalleth> changing that to var elem = $(element), $(container).prepend(elem), elem.fadeIn made it work
[11:13:57] <kalleth> don't know _Why_ that made it work, but
[11:14:19] <shoky> Cameron__: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/vbFPY/1/
[11:14:51] <shoky> (i changed the images classes for testing)
[11:15:16] <Cameron__> shoky, it still doesnt work :S
[11:15:31] <shoky> seems to work..
[11:15:35] <shoky> whats not working?
[11:15:39] <Cameron__> image 5 doesnt show
[11:15:49] <shoky> image 5 is 2012 now, it shows
[11:15:52] <Cameron__> oh
[11:16:06] <shoky> that's what i meant in parens ;P
[11:16:08] <Cameron__> oh
[11:16:10] <Cameron__> lol ok
[11:16:55] <shoky> so, the main thing was that you used next() which only looks at the immediately following sibling
[11:18:57] <shoky> kalleth: what is element? was that a string or an actual element?
[11:19:06] <kalleth> ohhh
[11:19:07] <kalleth> yes
[11:19:08] <kalleth> thats why
[11:19:19] <kalleth> it's a string because it comes back from handlebarsJS
[11:19:32] <kalleth> so $(element) creates domelement #1, inserts it, and Â£(element) then creates a new one that's not inserted anywhere
[11:19:35] <kalleth> ta :)
[11:19:36] <shoky> yah. so $(element) would create a brand new element ;p
[11:19:42] <kalleth> good shout :)
[11:20:01] <shoky> ;]
[11:20:02] <kalleth> i'm converting my massive-one-file-js-based-livestream thing to coffeescript atm
[11:20:07] <kalleth> and using js views for the first time ever
[11:20:15] <kalleth> and trying to properly wrap everything up, etc :p
[11:21:22] <bwq> why?
[11:21:27] <bwq> is coffeescript really worth using?
[11:21:33] <kalleth> imo, yes
[11:21:40] <kalleth> but its very personal preferency :)
[11:21:52] <kalleth> i'm a rails dev, so it seems nicer to me than JS
[11:22:13] <bwq> yeah, the changes didn't seem _that_ big to me
[11:22:44] <kalleth> https://github.com/kalleth/mpukviewr/blob/master/viewr/app/assets/javascripts/exp/view_manager.coffee
[11:22:49] <kalleth> ^ the file i was doing the jquery stuff in :)
[11:23:09] <kalleth> it makes JS OOP much nicer, honestly
[11:23:10] <shoky> if you know your javascript, and like the CS sugar better than raw js, i'm sure it's worth it
[11:23:14] <shoky> personally i hate it ;P
[11:23:19] <kalleth> thought you might ;)
[11:24:32] <kalleth> https://github.com/kalleth/mpukviewr/blob/b6abb9a1e9c03f2ef6c3db91b2f942fc58681c53/viewr/app/assets/javascripts/exp/vpop.js <- the version of the JS before i started converting it to CS
[11:24:46] <kalleth> honestly though, the separation of concerns could also have been done in JS to make it nicer
[11:25:00] <kalleth> showEvent() function is why i wanted to move across to js-based views (handlebars) ;)
[11:25:09] <shoky> i'm just a c guy inside ; p
[11:25:24] <kalleth> i'm sure someone has implemented pointers and malloc in javascript, dw :p
[11:25:34] <shoky> heh
[11:30:17] <Posterdati> shoky: http://87.6.237.113/www.centumcellae.it/index.html

[11:32:27] <shoky> Posterdati i get a phishing warning now ;)
[11:32:42] <shoky> i saw it before and pinged you ;P
[11:32:51] <Posterdati> ?
[11:33:04] <shoky> The website at 87.6.237.113 has been reported as a “phishing” site.
[11:33:28] <shoky> and it's a 404
[11:33:48] <Posterdati> it is working, but I've got problem on positioning
[11:33:50] <Posterdati> why=
[11:33:51] <Posterdati> why?
[11:33:54] <Posterdati> phishing?
[11:34:01] <shoky> The requested URL /www.centumcellae.it/index.html was not found on this server.
[11:34:29] <Posterdati> http://87.6.237.113/www.centumcellae.com/index.html
[11:35:32] <shoky> werks
[11:35:51] <Posterdati> ok
[11:36:03] <FernandoBasso> I can't make this code both highlight the input fields and return false at the same time. Any ideas are welcome. https://gist.github.com/1798930
[11:37:57] <shoky> FernandoBasso: you're returning before you call fill_out ..
[11:39:13] <FernandoBasso> shoky: If I call fill_out before, I get an "arguments[i] in undefined" in firebug...
[11:39:43] <shoky> how are you calling it..
[11:40:00] <shoky> dude
[11:40:00] <shoky> for (var i = 0; i <= arguments.length; i++)
[11:40:31] <shoky> learn your basics
[11:43:18] <bwq> ?
[11:43:21] <bwq> don't see what's wrong with that
[11:43:31] <bwq> except he doesn't define arguments anywhere lol
[11:43:39] <bwq> nor does he pass it :p
[11:44:42] <shoky> bwq lets say arguments == 0
[11:44:54] <shoky> is 0 <= 0?
[11:45:09] <shoky> arguments.length == 0, that is
[11:45:18] <ravenzz> btw for (var i=0, argument; argument = arguments[i]; i++) { }
[11:45:20] <ravenzz> is faster
[11:45:22] <ravenzz> iirc
[11:46:31] <shoky> speed is not the issue at hand..
[11:46:46] <FernandoBasso> Haven't I defined arguments in lines 14 and 15, and passed them in line 36?
[11:47:06] <shoky> FernandoBasso: go through the loop in your head, lets say there are 0 arguments
[11:47:20] <stan_man_can> If i'm making a mobile only website, should I do it with jquery mobile or bootstrap?
[11:47:22] <shoky> :\
[11:47:57] <bwq> bootstrap the jquery mobile
[11:48:02] <shoky> FernandoBasso: the problem is with this line only:  for (var i = 0; i <= arguments.length; i++)
[11:48:13] <shoky> arguments is fine
[11:48:31] <bwq> shoky: derp
[11:48:34] <bwq> completely read over that
[11:48:37] <shoky> ;]
[11:48:46] <ravenzz> FernandoBasso the condition is wrong, it should be i < arguments.length
[11:50:29] <FernandoBasso> Thank you guys. You are absolutely right.
[11:56:26] <jonkri> instead of "..." in ".mousedown(function(event) { if(event.which == 1) {  ... } }", what can i write to generate a right-click?
[11:58:03] <ted_> good evening everybody
[11:58:40] <ted_> I have a form with an input file, is possible to upload this file with ajax by jquery post ?
[12:01:33] <johnkpaul> ted_: not with jquery by itself, but this will help you http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
[12:01:42] <Jamal> Hey, i need some help. In the following example, i want the boxes to fade in, if i drag&drop one into the green or red area. Problem is it only works the second time. Wehn i first drag&drop one, it stays at the drop position, but when i drag it again, it fits to the area. Here is the code, it would be perfect if someone could help me: http://jsfiddle.net/G3vG6/1/
[12:03:03] <codeshah> hey guys, when I use a selecotr, I get multiple results, but I can't .join() them?
[12:04:01] <johnkpaul> codeshah: you can, but that's the regular Array.prototype.join, which I'm pretty sure will toString() everything
[12:04:38] <codeshah> hmm . so a $('#bla a').text() => this returns an array if there is more than one match?
[12:04:44] <ted_> johnkpaul : my form have different fields like first name, last name, etc. These field are add in my database with jquery ajax, with your link I can upload file with my fields at the same time ?
[12:05:00] <pierpark> any of you guys know why when I use data-url="#whatever" in Jquery Mobile that when anything (a dialog, or a back button) is clicked, it doesn't go back/close dialog? I have to hit it twice to get back to the page BEFORE the one I used data-url = "#whatever" on.
[12:05:32] <johnkpaul> codeshah: no, .text() takes the first element
[12:06:04] <jammsen> is there a good howto on JSON with jquery and PHP?
[12:06:45] <fris> jammsen http://www.jquery4u.com/json/ajaxjquery-getjson-simple/
[12:07:31] <Gambit-> Hi guys - http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:events right at the top says that jQuery(this).restoreRow should be acceptable within a function event.  The 'this' appears to be set properly, but every permutation of jQuery(this).restoreRow (without the ()) tells me that it's undefined.  How can I figure out how to fix things?
[12:07:50] <johnkpaul> ted_: did you read the docs of my link?
[12:07:54] <Gambit-> jammsen, I've been doing a fair bit of json+jquery muckery, though mostly with django and not php, if you have questions.
[12:09:09] <jammsen> i got an array in PHP with data, i need it to transport to JS, so that i can with jquery manipulate my tooltip with the data from the json object
[12:09:13] <jammsen> basically
[12:09:18] <jammsen> @ Gambit-
[12:09:28] <ravenzz> Gambit- restoreRow is a function so you need the round parenthesis
[12:09:29] <ted_> johnkpaul : yes, but there is not an example of a html page.
[12:09:42] <ravenzz> and probably a parameter (a row i guess)
[12:09:44] <Gambit-> jammsen, so which part of that are you having problems with?
[12:09:58] <species> ravenzz: that should be straightforward
[12:10:13] <jammsen> i got the array in php with json_encode
[12:10:15] <Gambit-> ravenzz, And it explodes if I try to call it with a TypeError 'no method restoreRow'.
[12:10:21] <jammsen> do i need to compress it with base64?
[12:10:28] <Gambit-> jammsen, nope
[12:10:46] <Gambit-> btw, base64 isn't "compression" it's an "encoding".
[12:10:49] <ravenzz> species shoudl be  :)
[12:11:01] <jammsen> i just want to hang the that on onmouseover="doSomething(----Here json--)"
[12:11:02] <ravenzz> ?demo @ Gambit-
[12:11:03] <bot-t> Gambit-, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:11:20] <ravenzz> is jQuery defined?
[12:11:25] <Gambit-> ravenzz, fair enough, let me see if I can get this all wedged in there.
[12:11:27] <codeshah> johnkpaul: oh hmmâ€¦ k
[12:11:29] <Gambit-> yes, jQuery is defined.
[12:11:47] <Gambit-> how do I add jqGrid in there?
[12:12:58] <Gambit-> ah, here's a working example
[12:13:00] <Gambit-> (thank you google)
[12:16:10] <ravenzz> Gambit- type "typeof jQuery.fn.jqGrid" on the dev tools console
[12:16:29] <Gambit-> "function"
[12:16:40] <ravenzz> so it should be there
[12:16:47] <Gambit-> oh yeah it's totally there
[12:17:26] <ravenzz> ok next Q are you using it within a function event?
[12:17:30] <Gambit-> yes
[12:17:39] <Gambit-> let me keep grinding on the jsfiddle for a moment, I almost have it repro.
[12:17:40] <ravenzz> I need to see your code then
[12:17:44] <ravenzz> perfect
[12:18:09] <jammsen> Gambit- : i got errors all over
[12:18:20] <Gambit-> jammsen, that's... not very specific :)
[12:19:12] <jammsen> <div class="overlay <?php echo $minimalname; ?>_slot j_tooltip" onmouseover="j_tooltip(<?php echo json_encode($items); ?>);">
[12:19:24] <jonkri> is there a way to convert a left click to a right click? :)
[12:19:33] <ravenzz> lul
[12:19:39] <jammsen> Gambit-: but it just explodes
[12:20:07] <johnkpaul> jonkri: look into the jquery event constructor
[12:20:22] <johnkpaul> jonkri: although, I have no idea why you'd want to do that
[12:20:22] <jammsen> Gambit-: http://privatepaste.com/4089647dc5
[12:20:39] <Gambit-> jammsen, let me get my jsfiddle working right, and then I'll take a look at yours if you're still stalled.
[12:21:57] <jonkri> johnkpaul: it's a little strange... but in short i'm using jquery contextmenu and want to activate the context menu using a left click under certain circumstances
[12:22:40] <johnkpaul> :) sounds very strange
[12:23:11] <johnkpaul> so create a jquery event with the properties of a right click and trigger that event
[12:25:26] <mocro275> hallo
[12:26:10] <Gambit-> ravenzz, awesomely, it works in jsfiddle, but not in my example.
[12:26:55] <Gambit-> let me make sure I'm not using mixed up versions of things.
[12:27:43] <ravenzz> yep
[12:32:01] <imsky> o lets do it!
[12:37:56] <Whirl3d> Hey all.
[12:39:53] <barfoo365> im trying to hide the media upload max size message which is <span class="max-upload-size"> by using .max-upload-size{display:none;} in the css - Its not working for some reason, am i approaching it in the right way
[12:40:17] <barfoo365> wrong channel
[12:40:34] <ravenzz> ask on #no-max-size-for-porn-upload
[12:40:55] <ravenzz> barfoo365 it should be
[12:42:27] <jammsen> Gambit-: still there?
[12:42:34] <Gambit-> yeah, still working on my issue.
[12:42:40] <jammsen> just one question
[12:43:13] <jammsen> onmouseover="functionname({"Item":{"name":"1","quality":"normal","slot":"gloves","ilvl":"63","rlvl":"60"},"Stats":["1% chance to inflict bleed damage over time"]});"
[12:43:16] <jammsen> is that right?
[12:43:23] <ravenzz> Gambit- is it live?
[12:43:27] <jammsen> or do i need to use " or ' ?
[12:43:36] <zsoc> jammsen: the last value of that array makes me very happy
[12:43:42] <zsoc> jammsen: " is fine
[12:44:19] <Gambit-> ravenzz, mine?  No, it's just a prototype internally.  Right now I'm normalizing my js files, or trying to, at least.
[12:44:29] <jammsen> zsoc : i mean here onmouseover="fn( HERE {DATA} AND HERE)
[12:44:36] <Gambit-> jammsen, you're doubling up on your "
[12:44:44] <zsoc> oh ya, no, don't do that
[12:44:52] <jammsen> which delimiter?!
[12:44:58] <jammsen> without?
[12:45:00] <zsoc> doubles outside, singles inside
[12:45:11] <jammsen> i dont create inside
[12:45:11] <zsoc> eh i'll stop talking, gambit obv knows what he's doing lol
[12:45:13] <jammsen> its
[12:45:23] <jammsen> php: json_encode($arr);
[12:45:25] <Gambit-> like hell I do :)
[12:45:33] <Gambit-> carry on zsoc
[12:46:02] <zsoc> nah, when i first opened irc back up i thought i was in ##php, jquery is not my strong point
[12:46:07] <zsoc> it's more of a necessity
[12:46:29] <Gambit-> he's not doing anything jquery-ish
[12:46:38] <Gambit-> just trying to figure out how to pass json around.
[12:47:43] <jonkri> the jquery documentation doesn't define what the different event types are
[12:47:58] <Gambit-> awesome, now I have big undefined box's in the middle of my jqgrids ><
[12:48:05] <jonkri> i'm trying to simulate a right-click with "var event = jQuery.Event("click", { which: 3 }); jQuery("body").trigger(event);", but nothing happens
[12:49:37] <johnkpaul> jonkri: close, but you need to do event.which = 3
[12:51:17] <jonkri> johnkpaul: like so: var event = jQuery.Event("click"); event.which = 3; jQuery("body").trigger(event); ?
[12:51:54] <jonkri> (it doesn't work. should the click be generated at the mouse pointer's current position?)
[12:52:10] <johnkpaul> it shouldn't be triggered on the body
[12:52:20] <johnkpaul> it needs to be triggered on the element that the click was made on
[12:53:58] <Whirl3d> Does anyone know of a custom scroller (vertical) that when you click on the scroll thumb a miniature version of the page with the visibile section highlighted hovers near the scroller indicating where you are relative to the full page?
[12:55:26] <Gambit-> ravenzz, I normalized my js and the problem went away, so I must have been mixing a bunch of versions or something.
[12:55:47] <Gambit-> ravenzz, maybe you can tell me why jqgrid contains within it a copy of jquery, as does everything else?  Which one am I supposed to use, where?
[12:57:24] <jonkri> johnkpaul: would it not be allowed to trigger it onto $(this).parent().parent()?
[12:57:45] <johnkpaul> jonkri: it's _allowed_, but it might not have the desired effect
[12:58:25] <jonkri> i see. good
[12:58:32] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i have created a button that i've set hidden, now i want to show it with $("#myid").css("display",""); but it doesn't show up. Can someone give me any advice?
[13:00:47] <Krambiorix> anyone?
[13:01:32] <rmurphey> Krambiorix: ideally, you'd just add/remove a class that controls visibility
[13:01:40] <rmurphey> rather than hard-coding a css setting into your js
[13:02:07] <rmurphey> however, http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/9eFUJ/
[13:02:46] <jonkri> johnkpaul: i'm trying to bring up a regular context menu on mouse hover here: http://jsfiddle.net/XhK7m/ ... am i doing something wrong?
[13:03:26] <Krambiorix> hmmm rmurphey that doesn't do it ...
[13:03:59] <rmurphey> Krambiorix: it works in the fiddle
[13:04:06] <rmurphey> so, it would seem you have some other issue going on
[13:04:21] <rmurphey> can you create a fiddle that demonstrates the problme?
[13:04:58] <johnkpaul> jonkri: there are no click handlers on that div in the fiddle
[13:05:04] <johnkpaul> what do you expect to happen when you hover?
[13:05:46] <johnkpaul> also jonkri, jQuery($(this)) is unneeded
[13:05:58] <johnkpaul> $ === jQuery in most cases
[13:06:56] <rodyhaddad> Hey guys. If I have a jQuery object that contains let's say 5 DOM elements. Is there a method that would transform that 1 jQuery object into an array of jQuery objects, each object containing 1 DOM element?
[13:07:52] <jonkri> johnkpaul: i think i found the problem. "click" does not trigger "onmousedown"
[13:08:09] <johnkpaul> jonkri: ah, well then create a mosuedown event
[13:08:59] <johnkpaul> rodyhaddad: $jqObj.map(function(i, el){return $(el);})
[13:12:20] <rodyhaddad> johnkpaul, does jQuery implement a map function :p. like Array.each => jQuery.each and Function.bind => jQuery.proxy, Array.map => jQuery.? :D
[13:13:15] <johnkpaul> :) rodyhaddad, that's what I used in my first option, it's called map
[13:13:17] <johnkpaul> ?jquery.map @ rodyhaddad
[13:13:19] <bot-t> rodyhaddad, jQuery.map(array, callback): Translate all items in an array or object to new array of items. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[13:13:52] <rodyhaddad> ohh…thx! :D
[13:14:52] <Cameron__> i have a for loop and i have values latitude1 latitude2 latitude3..... how do i call them in a for loop?
[13:15:02] <Cameron__> is it latitude{x}
[13:15:05] <Cameron__> would that work?
[13:15:53] <abjorn> imsky: SUP BROMOSEXUAL
[13:15:53] <bot-t> (45 hours 40 secs ago) <imsky> tell abjorn i'm a sexy teapot yo
[13:15:59] <abjorn> trunuff
[13:16:20] <imsky> chillin!
[13:16:34] <rmurphey> Cameron__: sounds like you want an array
[13:16:36] <imsky> what's going on down south abjorn
[13:16:42] <rmurphey> ?g mdn array
[13:16:44] <bot-t> rmurphey, Array - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/
[13:16:47] <abjorn> not a whole lot
[13:16:49] <abjorn> it's fucking hot
[13:16:51] <Cameron__> rmurphey, the values are from the database already
[13:16:56] <Cameron__> i want a simple way to loop them
[13:17:08] <rmurphey> Cameron__: still, if you want to iterate over a set of values, an array is the way to do it
[13:17:16] <rmurphey> not a bunch of variables that have numbers in their name
[13:18:17] <abjorn> imsky: sometimes I wish austin was in a different state. One that's not so fucking hot.
[13:18:28] <imsky> lol it's been 102-105 here all week
[13:18:39] <imsky> NOWHERE IS SAFE
[13:18:46] <abjorn> that's not too far off from here
[13:18:55] <abjorn> it was like 108 for a whole week
[13:19:11] <imsky> you said it
[13:19:24] <Whirl3d> are you talking iq points?
[13:19:29] <imsky> yeah, yours
[13:19:38] <Whirl3d> pfew....I wasn't sure.
[13:19:43] <abjorn> BAM
[13:19:47] <imsky> of course you weren't
[13:19:56] <Whirl3d> 102 is generous, thanks man.
[13:19:59] <bwq> imsky still ugly?
[13:20:02] <bwq> yup, seems like it
[13:20:05] <Whirl3d> I'm doin' better though
[13:20:09] <imsky> bwq yeah i think you still are
[13:20:16] <imsky> bwq no big change from yesterday
[13:20:38] <abjorn> #jquery haters ball
[13:20:48] <imsky> pimps up
[13:20:58] <abjorn> hoes down
[13:21:02] <imsky> awwww ye
[13:21:16] <Krambiorix> rmurphey, this is a part of the code that creates the button: http://pastebin.com/mUDuxv8i --> so i use the id "add_it" to unhide the button... Would that be correct?
[13:21:38] <Cameron__> how do i do it in an array rmurphey?
[13:21:46] <Cameron__> for (x=0; x<8; x++) {
[13:21:46] <Cameron__> 						alert(latitudes.x);
[13:21:46] <Cameron__> 					}
[13:21:48] <Cameron__> doesnt work
[13:21:54] <imsky> lo
[13:21:55] <imsky> l
[13:22:19] <rmurphey> Cameron__: latitudes[x]
[13:22:34] <rmurphey> .x would access the 'x' property of latitudes
[13:22:39] <jeffreylevesque> can someone tell me why 'el.closest is not a function' in this snippet: f (el.checked && (el).closest('.form-item').children('option').text != 'N/A' )
[13:22:41] <Cameron__> well apparently Uncaught TypeError: object is not a function
[13:22:50] <jeffreylevesque> if (el.checked && (el).closest('.form-item').children('option').text != 'N/A' )
[13:22:57] <imsky> lo
[13:22:58] <imsky> l
[13:24:18] <rmurphey> Cameron__: http://jsfiddle.net/rmurphey/HpjBm/
[13:24:27] <bwq> Cameron__: fastest way to get help is to pm imsky
[13:24:49] <imsky> god bless you bwq
[13:25:08] <rmurphey> Krambiorix: i can't really tell what you've got going on in that pastebin
[13:25:17] <bwq> :D
[13:25:19] <rmurphey> can you make a fiddle that reduces the problem to something simple that demonstrates the problem you're having?
[13:25:55] <PlasmaHH> hi, I just tried out to do some simple tabbing via jquery-ui (following simple example on jqueryui.com/demos/tabs) and I noticed that all text that is within the tabs is using a bigger fontsize...  what is causing this (and/or how to get the normal back?)
[13:26:35] <Krambiorix> rmurphey, i can't, my jquery skills aren't good enough for that. The pastebin just shows how the button's been created and how i hide it.  Can you make an educated guess? :)
[13:26:54] <rmurphey> nope
[13:27:10] <imsky> i can make one
[13:27:12] <imsky> for $9.99
[13:27:21] <rmurphey> for one, you're calling a function load_generated_dialog that i have no idea what it does
[13:27:37] <Krinkle> jeffreylevesque: You are missing an $ ?
[13:27:40] <rmurphey> and then the *fifth* (!) argument to that function is an array of objects
[13:27:43] <Krinkle> $(el) vs (el)
[13:27:56] <rmurphey> and i have no idea how that is used
[13:27:59] <Krinkle> the raw dom element object does (obviously) not have a function "closest"
[13:28:01] <rmurphey> so, no, i can't make an educated guess
[13:29:13] <imsky> $9.99, offer still good
[13:29:19] <imsky> or 3 easy payments of $3.99
[13:41:19] <cluelesscoder> hi, anyone have a little free time to check out some code of mine? it's at http://www.badcapitalist.com/test.html#stocksloaded - I'm trying to figure out how to output data which has been joined with a junction table and take off the duplicate stuff...

[13:43:36] <johnkpaul> cluelesscoder: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[13:43:44] <johnkpaul> read the second paragraph about special characers in selectors

Wehn i first drag&drop one, it stays at the drop position, but when i drag it again, it fits to the area. Here is the code, it would be perfect if someone could help me: http://jsfiddle.net/G3vG6/1/
[14:29:30] <Jamal> Anybody? :/
[14:30:05] <krater> no
[14:30:11] <krater> i need help too =(
[14:30:15] <Jamal> :|
[14:31:49] <_zoggy_> anyone here good with nodeJS ?
[14:32:25] <juha_> krater: so you want the next image?
[14:32:32] <juha_> krater: next image to what image?
[14:33:20] <rmurphey> Jamal: you have an error
[14:33:24] <rmurphey> Uncaught ReferenceError: ui is not defined
[14:33:39] <rmurphey> er
[14:33:40] <rmurphey> nevermind
[14:33:42] <rmurphey> that was my error :)
[14:34:54] <Jamal> :D
[14:35:09] <johnkpaul> cluelesscoder: in the console, are you able to select for that id?
[14:36:44] <rmurphey> Jamal: if i knew more about UI i could be more helpful -- best as i can tell, something is happening in the dragstop handler that makes it work
[14:36:51] <rmurphey> that is, that makes it work the second time
[14:37:04] <rmurphey> at least, that is my guess
[14:38:15] <Jamal> yo i think the problem is the clone
[14:38:24] <Jamal> but i don't really know how to handle it
[14:40:25] <krater> juha_ from .ativa
[14:45:20] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: it's inside an if statement; I'm getting ReferenceError: extraSector is not defined
[14:45:41] <juha_> krater: children or sibling?
[14:46:25] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: I was able to get it to work with the append() after I changed it from that selector, but not with appendTo(); still, insertAfter is what I'd prefer...
[14:46:37] <johnkpaul> Jamal: the clone is at ui.helper
[14:46:44] <johnkpaul> perhaps animate ui.helper rather than ui.draggable?
[14:47:01] <johnkpaul> cluelesscoder: where is the error?
[14:49:00] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: I'm not really sure... firebug wasn't giving me an error when I wasn't using the console; it just wasn't working
[14:49:33] <cluelesscoder> the if statement was working, and I think variable definition was working, but the insertAfter was not
[14:49:49] <Jamal> johnkpaul: No that doesnt work either :/
[14:50:09] <johnkpaul> Jamal: hmm, I don't know, but ui.helper is the cloned element, so hopefully htat helps you
[14:50:22] <johnkpaul> cluelesscoder: so there aren't any errors in the console?
[14:51:29] <Jamal> johnkpaul: first of all the question is what is taken for drag&drop? The original or the clone? because i think the first time, the original div is taken and the second time the clone, so it works for the clone but not for the original
[14:51:54] <johnkpaul> Jamal: I think that's because the clone is position:absolute, but the draggable itself is not
[14:51:59] <johnkpaul> at the time of the drop
[14:52:48] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: stupid question... how would I do the selector ('select[id="stock\\&sector"]') in the console?
[14:53:07] <johnkpaul> $('select[id="stock\\&sector"]')
[14:53:08] <johnkpaul> but
[14:53:25] <johnkpaul> use $(('#stock\\&sector')
[14:54:21] <cluelesscoder> why is that?
[14:54:29] <cluelesscoder> it just returns jQuery ( )
[14:55:05] <johnkpaul> cluelesscoder: document.getElementById('stock&sector')
[14:55:09] <johnkpaul> although I don't know how to escape that
[14:56:12] <Jamal> johnkpaul: Okay, if i set the draggable div to position absolute, i think the clone directly fades in, but the original does not and sticks somewehere on the page
[14:56:27] <johnkpaul> Jamal: that might be because you're using relative top/left animations
[14:57:09] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: yeah, that returns <span id="stock&sector" style="float: right;">
[14:57:39] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul:, I got the insertAfter to work I think...oddly enough it is appending the first time though for some reason
[14:58:14] <Jamal> johnkpaul: are there any other possibilities?
[14:59:10] <johnkpaul> Jamal: you're sure it's not that?
[14:59:20] <johnkpaul> Jamal: I am sure there are many, but I don't know what off the top of my head
[14:59:26] <johnkpaul> cluelesscoder: I am confused, it _is_ working now?
[14:59:33] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: I'll keep playing with it; I've got some significant problems in my algorithm that I need to think about anyway - if you know of good tutorials o fetching and outputting many-to-many I'd love to see it
[15:00:01] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: sort of working; I'm inserting after a span tag, but the first one is appending and the next ones are inserting after that appended one
[15:00:37] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: I guess I'm just not seeing the code that's making it append
[15:00:48] <raj> I'm doing this in my code, but for some reason I can't access `myobj` in my code within the $.each() --> http://jsfiddle.net/thapar/wg5YU/
[15:00:53] <raj> it works in the fiddle though
[15:00:54] <johnkpaul> cluelesscoder: have you used the chrome/firebug javascript debugger?
[15:00:56] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: you've been quite helpful, but I don't want to take too much more of your time
[15:01:04] <raj> I'm absolutely confused what is causing this issue
[15:01:38] <johnkpaul> cluelesscoder: :) well that's good, I hope that you figure it out, there are tools out there that I'd work on learning to help you more effecitvely
[15:02:02] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: I use the firebug one, but it's not always clear what's going on... especially when it jumps to the jquery part
[15:02:05] <raj> wait no, now it's working
[15:02:07] <raj> wtf did i do!
[15:02:19] <johnkpaul> cluelesscoder: you're using the minfiied jquery?
[15:02:23] <johnkpaul> use the unminified jquery for development
[15:02:31] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: good point, yeah, using minified
[15:03:02] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: didn't bother switching because the jQuery code was confusing enough :p
[15:03:37] <cluelesscoder> or too confusing, rather
[15:03:38] <johnkpaul> cluelesscoder: it's not that bad, but minified it's impossible
[15:03:46] <johnkpaul> you get more used to it, as with anything else
[15:04:04] <cluelesscoder> johnkpaul: do you ever find errors in it?
[15:04:23] <johnkpaul> errors in jQuery itself? no, but I've found hundreds of my own errors because I didn't understand what jquery expects me to do
[15:04:43] <cluelesscoder> ah, cool, thanks
[15:05:02] <johnkpaul> no problem
[15:06:26] <mrcriffis> cluelesscoder: if you are getting errors in jQuery it is probably because of either a bad selector (inside $() ), or an error in your syntax
[15:06:34] <mrcriffis> are you using a linter?
[15:06:36] <Jamal> johnkpaul: I don't really understand what u mean by the relative animations i use. what could i change that this might work?
[15:07:14] <johnkpaul> Jamal: rather then calculating the delta, calculate the absolute position that the element should be
[15:07:42] <johnkpaul> and then don't use '+='
[15:08:22] <johnkpaul> I have to head out Jamal, if you are still having a problem, I'll be back sometime tomorrow
[15:08:24] <johnkpaul> good luck!
[15:08:49] <digs> I am trying to ensure that a form input field is not empty and does not have a class name of 'error' -- if($('#edit-zip').val() != ''  && $('#edit-zip').not('error'))
[15:09:27] <shoky> digs: .error
[15:09:30] <digs> However, that does not work. I also tried '.error'  and !($('#edit-zip').hasClass('error')) and !($('#edit-zip').hasClass('.error'))
[15:10:54] <shoky> digs: !$('#edit-zip').hasClass('error')  should work
[15:11:44] <digs> hm. Weird... take off the parends and it works.
[15:11:49] <digs> Thanks shoky. I didn't think to try that.
[15:11:57] <mrcriffis> digs: do both work individually?
[15:12:24] <shoky> digs you did try that (you just added parens)
[15:12:46] <digs> yeah... but with the parends, it does not work.
[15:13:06] <digs> which seems odd to me... but whatever. It works.
[15:13:16] <krater> JuanCri sibling
[15:13:39] <krater> juha_ sibling, i already test with this function in jquery but failed =(
[15:14:00] <krater> juha_ did you see the code?
[15:14:35] <mrcriffis> digs: should be or instad of and
[15:14:40] <shoky> digs it works with the parens too
[15:14:59] <shoky> he said he wants and, not or
[15:15:34] <mrcriffis> but he has an exclam at the begining
[15:15:48] <digs> shoky, but that was the very first thing I tried. !($('#edit-zip').hasClass('error')) -- Which did not work.
[15:16:02] <shoky> it works fine, you must've messed up something else
[15:16:09] <digs> heh okay.
[15:17:08] <digs> prehaps a browser cache issue.
[15:18:11] <shoky> mayhaps
[15:24:44] <digs> How do you make a form field not be allowed to auto populate?
[15:29:18] <shoky> auto populated by whom?
[15:32:04] <digs> the browser.
[15:33:11] <shoky> autocomplete=off i guess..
[15:33:13] <digs> http://dev.fdanconia.com/los/register -- The email field has a blur ajax call attached... if it is auto populated then I don't get the blur event. If the email is not in the database, then the password fields pop up below the email to allow the user to create a new account.
[15:33:24] <shoky> but the browser will populate whatever it wants to, in the end..
[15:33:30] <digs> yeah.
[15:34:32] <digs> this is a problem for sure.
[15:34:52] <shoky> you're counting on a blur event on page load?
[15:36:30] <digs> no. the page loads... the form is displayed to the user. If they are already logged in there is no issue. If they are a non-logged in user, then there is no problem. If they are a brand new user... then after they put in their email address and blur from that field... two more form fields show up to have them enter a password.
[15:36:55] <digs> the problem is when the user begings to fill out the form and auto completes everything.
[15:47:30] <sinusss> hi guys. why does alert show up in this code> http://jsfiddle.net/
[15:48:05] <systemfault> You should paste the link where your code is..
[15:50:19] <digs> sinusss, click save and paste that link.
[15:50:53] <sinusss> oh fail... sorry about that... here is the link digs http://jsfiddle.net/wenbert/TCsJ9/
[15:54:50] <systemfault> sinusss: Your question doesn't make sense..
[15:54:59] <systemfault> What do you expect to happen?
[15:55:32] <sinusss> sorry about that systemfault
[15:55:59] <sinusss> my new problem is http://pastie.org/4222763 - it only triggers the fancybox on the second click of the "a:
[15:56:03] <sinusss> *"a"
[15:58:23] <systemfault> That code looks right :(
[15:59:05] <systemfault> Hmm, except the extra comma
[15:59:18] <systemfault> after the ajax object
[16:06:43] <mrcriffis> sinusss: first click inits fancy box, second launches. you need to init fancybox outside of your handler, then manually trigger fancybox to show
[16:09:20] <sinusss> mrcriffis thanks
[16:09:35] <mrcriffis> sinusss: no problem

[17:36:38] <zamn> thanks
[17:41:24] <felipe_Brz> could anybody tell me what that little tilde means next to the 'return' command? http://pastie.org/4223126
[17:41:32] <felipe_Brz> or whether it's a typo
[17:43:01] <zamn> hey is there any way i can write: $("id").parent().parent().children().length; nicer? lol :p
[17:46:19] <felipe_Brz> i think you could define a function for that zamn
[17:47:24] <zamn> felipe_Brz: what do you mean?
[17:47:47] <felipe_Brz> well you could define a function that, given and id, returns those elements you want
[17:48:03] <zamn> so you mean abstract away the ugliness
[17:48:10] <felipe_Brz> then, instead of writing that long concatenation of functions you could just call the function you've defined
[17:48:13] <felipe_Brz> i guess
[17:48:18] <felipe_Brz> it's the simplest way I think
[17:48:24] <zamn> yeah
[17:48:27] <zamn> that makes sense
[17:48:45] <zamn> $("id").getGrandParent(); heh
[17:50:38] <coldhead> felipe_Brz: i think it's a typo
[17:51:27] <felipe_Brz> hmm ok thx coldhead
[17:51:35] <coldhead> felipe_Brz: maybe not though
[17:51:43] <felipe_Brz> that code is php though
[17:51:52] <coldhead> Bitwise NOT | ~ a | Inverts the bits of its operand.
[17:51:56] <felipe_Brz> it's a javascript callback fed into a php object
[17:51:57] <coldhead> ?eval ~ 666
[17:52:03] <bot-t> coldhead: -667
[17:52:19] <shoky> ~N == -(N+1)
[17:52:26] <coldhead> it DOES something, it's just not clear if that's what you want
[17:52:33] <coldhead> ?eval ~0
[17:52:33] <bot-t> coldhead: -1
[17:53:09] <coldhead> http://timmywillison.com/pres/operators/#tilde
[17:53:16] <coldhead> god bless you. timmywil

[18:37:30] <zim> Hi all. being stupid I am sure http://jsfiddle.net/eGQvj/
[18:37:49] <jonkersjoe> hi to set the gradient of an item is it background, background-image, background-color when you use $(".element").css("background", "-webkit-linear-gradient(top, #444444, #999999)"); ?background seems to be working on my browser but I can also see articles using background-image so I'm not sure what teh difference is
[18:39:59] <zim> jonkersjoe: not image if you are creating the grad in css
[18:40:17] <jonkersjoe> ahh ok so its only background
[18:41:11] <zim> yes background image is where you use a graduated image to create the effect
[18:41:59] <zim> Any chance someone could tell me where I am being stupid? Selector question http://jsfiddle.net/eGQvj/
[18:43:51] <abjorn> imsky: we should make a javascript framework so we can be cool too
[18:44:06] <imsky> abjorn, let's do it chief
[18:44:19] <jonkersjoe> zim: try this http://jsfiddle.net/eGQvj/1/
[18:44:41] <zim> ty
[18:44:52] <imsky> abjorn, any general ideas on what it's going to do?
[18:46:04] <abjorn> it's going to look like it's going to help you structure your application but really it's going to need a boilerplate library on top of it to do that
[18:46:21] <imsky> oh i see you started backbone development
[18:46:27] <imsky> welcome to the pain and misery
[18:46:29] <abjorn> hahaha
[18:46:33] <abjorn> I started a couple months back
[18:46:40] <abjorn> my major project at work uses it
[18:46:56] <abjorn> there weren't 999999 options at the time we chose it
[18:47:05] <imsky> there aren't that many now
[18:47:12] <abjorn> IT FEELS LIKE IT SOMETIMES
[18:47:15] <abjorn> new one every week
[18:47:17] <imsky> marionette and relational are the biggest ones i know of, and i use neither
[18:47:32] <imsky> i made my own sweet as hell view manager
[18:47:45] <abjorn> spine, angular, knockout, ember
[18:47:49] <abjorn> javascriptmvc
[18:47:54] <imsky> that ain't backbone libraries
[18:47:59] <imsky> you jive turkey
[18:48:08] <abjorn> oh i was referring to js frameworks
[18:48:14] <imsky> also spine was an option two months back
[18:48:18] <abjorn> i know
[18:48:27] <abjorn> well most of them were, but they weren't well known
[18:48:32] <abjorn> well
[18:48:34] <abjorn> some of them were
[18:48:37] <abjorn> well
[18:48:37] <imsky> angular's kinda fugazi
[18:48:54] <abjorn> we chose like 2-3 months ago, and the big names were backbone, spine, and knockout
[18:49:03] <imsky> ember seems to be the best alternative to backbone, but handlebars and html in js strings? ololol
[18:49:08] <abjorn> and it annoyed me that spine's docs were all fuckin coffeescript
[18:49:14] <imsky> backbone too btw
[18:49:32] <imsky> HURR DURR I NEED TO BE FASHIONABLE IN MY CIRCLEJERK OF WEB DEVELOPERS
[18:49:32] <abjorn> and i was never a fan of knockout
[18:49:53] <imsky> knockout ~= angular
[18:49:55] <abjorn> backbone had the most documentation and articles out there about it
[18:49:57] <abjorn> I know that
[18:50:03] <imsky> yeah...except it doesn't dude
[18:50:14] <imsky> all that material fools you into believing an ecosystem exists
[18:50:27] <imsky> then, 3 hours later you're on some obscure gist figuring out how this shit works
[18:50:32] <abjorn> I don't think any of them have a real ecosystem
[18:50:34] <abjorn> they're all too new
[18:50:37] <imsky> sencha
[18:50:40] <abjorn> cept javascriptmvc
[18:50:43] <abjorn> well that too
[18:50:47] <abjorn> but cmon who uses that
[18:50:52] <abjorn> other than sencha
[18:50:54] <imsky> big ball playas
[18:51:08] <abjorn> javascriptmvc has been around forever but idk anyone who uses it
[18:51:23] <imsky> well our framework's gonna be kickass
[18:51:27] <abjorn> idk how all these big name sites use backbone, it's a little frustrating how much it *isn't* a framework
[18:51:30] <imsky> it's gonna use prototypal inheritance
[18:51:34] <imsky> not faggy .extend
[18:51:37] <abjorn> lol
[18:51:49] <abjorn> I don't have any particular probably with .extend
[18:52:09] <imsky> do you love how custom attributes of views go to the options variable if you initialize it with them?
[18:52:14] <imsky> and how that doesn't happen with models?
[18:52:40] <abjorn> :D
[18:52:45] <abjorn> YAY INCONSISTENCY
[18:52:57] <imsky> why did i ever suggest it to my client..jesus christ
[18:53:02] <abjorn> lol
[18:53:04] <imsky> the same hipsters that bitch about ASI wrote this thing
[18:53:07] <zim> where can I find a list of .on triggers i.e. click, blur, focus, etc
[18:53:16] <imsky> zim, jquery docs
[18:53:25] <zim> imsky: where?
[18:53:33] <imsky> are you toying with me
[18:53:42] <abjorn> If I could go back I wouldn't choose Backbone, I think.
[18:53:45] <imsky> same
[18:53:50] <abjorn> http://docs.jquery.com
[18:53:52] <imsky> ember or something that doesn't use string tempaltes
[18:53:52] <abjorn> @zim
[18:53:54] <zim> imsky: http://api.jquery.com/on/ is late
[18:54:00] <abjorn> ember looks interestingish
[18:54:07] <abjorn> but i havent gotten a good look
[18:54:07] <imsky> the handlebars ruins it for me though
[18:54:22] <abjorn> I don't have any particular preference on templating languages
[18:54:25] <imsky> "opinionated" = we didn't put in enough time to make it customizable, HERES ALL OUR SHIT, LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT
[18:54:32] <abjorn> which is why im like "fuck it, ill use underscore templates" in this backbone project
[18:54:38] <imsky> naw playa
[18:54:43] <imsky> all my templates are from the dom
[18:54:55] <imsky> i liked how transparency did it, but they kinda failed at attributes and such
[18:55:03] <imsky> so it's a combo of dom extraction and hogan
[18:55:06] <abjorn> you're not using a templating language?
[18:55:18] <imsky> hogan, mustache. but not writing a drop of html in js
[18:55:28] <imsky> or anywhere really
[18:55:29] <abjorn> oh, well, yeah
[18:55:44] <imsky> i could do without, and just do straight up dom manipulation, like transparency
[18:55:48] <abjorn> im using backbone boilerplate, so it's all separate, just gets compiled into one file with grunt.js
[18:55:51] <imsky> but that's more pain
[18:56:00] <zim> HaHa. http://api.jquery.com/category/events/
[18:56:14] <imsky> i wrote a generic template dependency resolver, abjorn. so i can swap out templating engines AT WILL
[18:56:14] <abjorn> realistically I'd say putting it in the doc micro-templating style would work the best though
[18:56:16] <imsky> AT WILL
[18:56:20] <abjorn> AT WILL
[18:56:21] <abjorn> SHIT SON
[18:56:24] <imsky> AT WILL
[18:56:38] <imsky> i read this blogpost, "microtemplating is dead" and i knew that it was dead years ago
[18:56:43] <abjorn> lol
[18:56:52] <abjorn> I don't even get the difference
[18:56:57] <abjorn> templating is templating
[18:56:58] <imsky> i thought i was just being a noob, putting html in javascript
[18:57:02] <imsky> then i realized everyone was doing it
[18:57:10] <imsky> a big wave of "fuck this gay industry" washed over me
[18:57:17] <abjorn> lol
[18:57:32] <imsky> dom templating is the future
[18:57:38] <imsky> angular and knockout are doing it right, as is transparency
[18:58:04] <abjorn> idk how they're doing it
[18:58:13] <imsky> you didn't even check out angular?
[18:58:17] <zim> is there a way i can .on('change' ... this a wait until no action for say 1000?
[18:58:18] <imsky> it's got google's muscular support
[18:58:20] <abjorn> not really
[18:58:38] <abjorn> i stopped keeping up with them
[18:58:44] <imsky> google also released some jeevesy thing
[18:58:45] <imsky> what was it
[18:58:57] <abjorn> didnt they release like
[18:59:00] <abjorn> two different fucking frameworks
[18:59:01] <abjorn> likme
[18:59:03] <abjorn> like
[18:59:04] <abjorn> whut
[18:59:10] <imsky> hang on, searching twitters
[19:00:33] <imsky> damn..it's so obscure i can't find it
[19:01:07] <abjorn> I don't keep tabs on the frameworks because I don't have any new projects going on, none that necessitate a framework, anyways.
[19:01:41] <imsky> working with a js framework made me realize i need a backend framework
[19:01:54] <imsky> the thought of writing more php from scratch is just horrifying
[19:01:56] <abjorn> I never do any real backend shit so
[19:01:58] <abjorn> lol
[19:02:12] <abjorn> we a custom codeigniter boilerplate
[19:02:22] <imsky> that's what i'm going to try to understand
[19:02:23] <abjorn> well, when we're not using perl
[19:02:35] <imsky> CI seems like the only not-retarded framework out there
[19:02:42] <abjorn> and they can't seem to decide on a perl framework to use, if any
[19:02:53] <abjorn> that's what I've gathered, imsky
[19:03:07] <imsky> still searching for that google thing jesus christ i'm dixated
[19:03:10] <imsky> fixated even
[19:03:24] <abjorn> two of my coworkers built a localization library around it, so they have this boilerplate setup so you can localize stuff pretty well
[19:03:53] <abjorn> we're several years late on it, tbh, considering how many of our customers aren't american or similar
[19:03:54] <imsky> YEOMAN
[19:04:00] <imsky> http://yeoman.io/
[19:04:07] <imsky> fuck with a catchy name like that, we're all BOUND to use it
[19:04:26] <abjorn> lol
[19:04:46] <imsky> you can see addy osmani slap together something with bootstrap using this thing
[19:05:02] <imsky> this gets me thinking
[19:05:07] <imsky> remember i told you about slitaz
[19:05:12] <abjorn> uhhhh idr
[19:05:13] <imsky> the weirdo linux distro
[19:05:26] <imsky> anyway, their whole setup process is in a webpage
[19:05:32] <imsky> so httpd talks to some daemon and they get shit done
[19:05:56] <imsky> so if you watch that yeoman vid, you'll see that this guy basically "grunt.js++"'s his way into a basic site from CLI
[19:06:21] <imsky> but why would people who pretend to have good aesthetic taste reduce themselves to a black and green CLI?
[19:06:41] <imsky> why couldn't they just have written some micro-ruby server that takes care of all the bullshit
[19:07:23] <abjorn> because using CLI makes you cool
[19:07:33] <imsky> after i saw slitaz do it...i'm not convinced
[19:07:40] <imsky> also, the webshell in turnkey is killer
[19:07:44] <abjorn> IT MAKES YOU COOL
[19:07:45] <abjorn> IMSKY
[19:07:49] <imsky> naw playa
[19:07:51] <abjorn> YOU'RE NOT COOL UNLESS YOU CAN CLI ALL THE THINGS
[19:08:17] <imsky> stinky-banana-market imsky$ photoshop
[19:08:21] <imsky> there it is
[19:08:27] <imsky> LAUNCHING IN BEAUTIFUL NCURSES
[19:08:44] <abjorn> ncurses photoshop rofl
[19:09:34] <imsky> i think it was dziuba who pointed out the irony: apple labored for decades bringing the GUI to the masses, and they ended up leaving the interesting stuff in CLI
[19:10:41] <imsky> lol yeoman: "Automatically compile CoffeeScript & Compass"
[19:10:46] <imsky> now i remember why i didn't bookmark it
[19:10:58] <abjorn> hahaha
[19:11:59] <abjorn> why is it whenever we start talking we take over the channel
[19:12:07] <imsky> everyone else recognizes the real
[19:12:12] <abjorn> they're too scared
[19:12:15] <abjorn> to keeps it this real
[19:12:27] <abjorn> right, coldhead?
[19:12:28] <imsky> we should call it
[19:12:30] <imsky> real.js
[19:12:34] <abjorn> rofl yes
[19:12:36] <imsky> god what a good name
[19:12:43] <abjorn> real.js - the framework that keeps it real
[19:12:46] <tw2113> "right" and coldhead don't go in the same sentence
[19:12:49] <tw2113> *runs*
[19:12:54] <imsky> i love coldhead
[19:13:05] <abjorn> i love coldhead like i love a head cold
[19:13:11] <abjorn> hurr hurr
[19:13:14] <tw2113> i heard warm head is better
[19:13:17] <tw2113> *runs again*
[19:13:27] <imsky> what the hell is wrong with you
[19:13:36] <tw2113> i need my exercise?
[19:13:37] <imsky> also abjorn https://twitter.com/realjs
[19:13:38] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from realjs: Thanks! â˜… http://bit.ly/PCNxzX
[19:13:48] <abjorn> lol
[19:13:55] <imsky> notice how twitter has abandoned their hashbang ways?
[19:14:03] <imsky> I WISH BACKBONE AUTHORS KNEW ABOUT THIS HTML5 THING
[19:14:23] <abjorn> whatchya mean
[19:14:31] <tw2113> no more twitter banging?
[19:14:37] <imsky> before it would have been twitter.com/#!realjs
[19:14:38] <abjorn> you don't have to use hashbang with backbone, imsky :o
[19:14:49] <imsky> abjorn, yeah you can use some fidgety plugin
[19:14:56] <abjorn> no
[19:15:01] <abjorn> you can use pushState
[19:15:02] <tw2113> oh nice, the hashbangs are gone
[19:15:11] * tw2113 never used them in manually created links anyway
[19:15:12] <abjorn> i think it uses pushState out of the box
[19:15:18] <imsky> hmm how does that work, lemme read docs
[19:15:27] <imsky> backbone docs are terrible too
[19:15:36] <imsky> it's telling why jquery and php dominate the world
[19:15:39] <imsky> good docs
[19:15:46] <abjorn> Backbone.history.start({ pushState: true });
[19:15:55] <imsky> yeah i'm at htat point too
[19:15:58] <imsky> let's see how it works
[19:16:06] <abjorn> I'm using it in my project at work
[19:16:07] <abjorn> works fine
[19:16:07] <imsky> what with all my links being #/herp/derp
[19:16:42] <imsky> lol not over here
[19:16:49] <abjorn> then i made a mod_rewrite rule to push all URI's that aren't files and shit to index.html
[19:16:53] <abjorn> weird
[19:16:55] <abjorn> works for me
[19:16:58] <imsky> that might be it
[19:17:11] <imsky> i already resigned to my fate
[19:17:14] <abjorn> well yeah, obviously
[19:17:19] <abjorn> if you just go to the url without that
[19:17:22] <abjorn> webserver is gonna be like
[19:17:29] <abjorn> "bitch what you talkin bout, that aint a thing"
[19:17:45] <imsky> @jashkenas: "Clicking HTML links certainly isn't compatible with pushState -- what would the link even be?"
[19:17:53] <imsky> i'm learning this now? fffffuuuuuuu
[19:18:16] <abjorn> backbone boilerplate has like a 5-line thing that fixes that
[19:18:22] <imsky> $('a').click(function (e) {
[19:18:22] <imsky>     app.navigate($(this).attr('href'), true);
[19:18:22] <imsky>     return false;
[19:18:22] <imsky> });
[19:18:25] <imsky> ^ AHAHAHAHA
[19:18:25] <abjorn> just adds a handler to every a tag that makes it work with push state lol
[19:18:29] <imsky> AHAHAHAHA
[19:18:34] <imsky> YOU HAVE TO BE SHITTING MY PANTS
[19:18:42] <abjorn> lol bboilerplate does it a little better than that lol
[19:18:44] <imsky> we hashbanging for now
[19:18:55] <imsky> i'm not jerry rigging my goddamn links
[19:19:00] <abjorn> lol
[19:19:11] <abjorn> https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate/blob/master/app/main.js#L22
[19:19:11] <imsky> https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/issues/456
[19:19:12] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #456 on backbone (imdonkey; 1y, 5d ago): questions about pushState and history
[19:19:29] <imsky> you have to be kidding...no...
[19:19:32] <imsky> that's not a solution
[19:19:41] <abjorn> well, it's a solution in the sense that it works
[19:19:45] <imsky> back to the drawing board friends
[19:20:32] <imsky> lol some things are just undercooked
[19:20:50] <abjorn> idk i dont have any particular problem with that
[19:21:01] <imsky> standards my dear boy
[19:21:07] <imsky> also there's no serverside fallback for my app
[19:21:15] <imsky> so pushstate can suck it
[19:21:16] <abjorn> true
[19:21:44] <imsky> so back to my point, I WISH BACKBONE AUTHORS KNEW ABOUT THIS HTML5 THING
[19:21:44] <abjorn> after a certain amount of complexity I get lazy and say "fuck it" to fallbacks.
[19:22:10] <abjorn> at least until the frontend makes that not such a pia
[19:22:13] <imsky> the perfect site: no css, no js
[19:22:16] <abjorn> lol
[19:22:16] <imsky> html 3.2
[19:22:19] <abjorn> ALL TABLES
[19:22:24] <imsky> no tables even
[19:22:35] <imsky> ALL......IMAGE MAPS
[19:22:37] <abjorn> oh, so how html was intended to be used?
[19:22:38] <abjorn> oh
[19:22:39] <abjorn> image maps
[19:22:46] <abjorn> shit son

[19:32:34] <sinusss> hi everyone. how would I fix this so that when I click on "#slide-description > a" the first time, it loads the fancybox right away? Right now, I have to click it twice
[19:32:35] <abjorn> you reading the wikipedia article on unit 731?
[19:32:35] <sinusss> http://pastie.org/4223505
[19:32:59] <bwq> no
[19:33:02] <bwq> looking at wiggle() :D
[19:33:07] <bwq> all those wiggling marios
[19:33:14] <abjorn> it's the best

[19:33:20] * abjorn wiggles
[19:33:24] * imsky wiggles
[19:33:53] <bwq> haha
[19:34:06] <bwq> but no seriously, that was a honest question
[19:34:14] <bwq> did anything _really_ worthwhile come out the past few years?
[19:34:14] <imsky> you had a question
[19:34:17] <imsky> yes
[19:34:25] <imsky> duh
[19:34:32] <bwq> i want names :D
[19:34:33] <abjorn> we gave an honest answer
[19:34:44] <abjorn> but also bootstrap
[19:34:47] <bwq> i don't really do web dev, so i was just curious
[19:34:53] <bwq> aside from bootstrap?
[19:35:04] <abjorn> uhhhh steve jobs died
[19:35:07] <abjorn> so there's that
[19:35:09] <bwq> haha
[19:35:46] <imsky> three.js, paper.js, cssfx >_>
[19:36:05] <abjorn> sinusss: Are you sure it's only happening with two clicks, and you're not just clicking it twice in impatience while it loads?
[19:36:12] <abjorn> cssfx fosho
[19:36:21] <abjorn> impact.js is neato
[19:36:26] <sinusss> hi everyone. how would I fix this so that when I click on "#slide-description > a" the first time, it loads the fancybox right away? Right now, I have to click it twice  > http://pastie.org/4223505
[19:36:28] <imsky> ye ye
[19:36:30] <imsky> processing.js
[19:36:33] <abjorn> it would be more neato if it was free, but yeah
[19:36:39] <sinusss> abjorn sorry
[19:36:42] <sinusss> let me check that
[19:37:31] <sinusss> abjorn nope it loads the fancybox in the second click.
[19:38:01] <abjorn> then fancybox probably doesn't auto-open when created
[19:38:06] <abjorn> then the second call opens it
[19:38:06] <systemfault> sinusss: The fancybox call doesn't open the box, it adds a click handler.
[19:38:15] <abjorn> yeah there you go
[19:39:05] <sinusss> hmmm systemfault so, how would I go about that in my code?
[19:39:08] <systemfault> sinusss: If you replace $(this).find('a').fancybox({ with $("#slide-description a").fancybox({ and remove the .on, it will probably work
[19:39:11] <sinusss> I have updated it a bit: http://pastie.org/4223505
[19:39:22] <sinusss> systemfault let me try that
[19:40:54] <imsky> abjorn, you ever used dart?
[19:41:21] <berndj> what might cause a combobox from DataTables to fail (only on some version of IE, i don't know which exactly) to be below a Dialog that pops up over the rest of the DataTable?
[19:41:54] <abjorn> imsky: Nah, looked too much like java to me
[19:42:11] <bbt> hi, could someone link me to an image rotator that cycles through a portfolio with the middle image being larger than the rest and cycles through them all?
[19:42:12] <imsky> hmm
[19:42:13] <abjorn> plus i dont like adding that compile step
[19:42:18] <abjorn> brb i need a drink
[19:42:18] <bwq> man what
[19:42:24] <bwq> angularjs is made by google
[19:42:28] <imsky> yes
[19:42:31] <bwq> i should check this stuff more often :(
[19:42:35] <systemfault> abjorn: That's its strength.. and probably the reason why it could become very popular (I think)
[19:43:53] <entrada> @bbt like coverflow?
[19:44:55] <bbt> entrada yeah something like that, thanks
[19:45:32] <entrada> google jquery coverflow
[19:45:36] <entrada> plenty of results
[19:45:43] <entrada> https://www.google.co.in/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=jquery+coverflow
[19:46:14] <imsky> google.co.in?
[19:46:22] <imsky> google coin!
[19:47:00] <abjorn> yummy alcohol

[19:47:27] <entrada> @bbt :)
[19:51:42] <sinusss> systemfault, it loads the href - so $("#slide-description a").fancybox({... did not work
[19:53:00] <systemfault> sinusss: Then use the code with onâ€¦ but instead of attaching the fancybox to the node.. see if there's a open function or something like that in the fancybox docs
[19:54:48] <entrada> sinusss: you're doing it wrong.
[19:54:54] <entrada> read the docs
[19:54:58] <entrada> what you should do is
[19:55:11] <entrada> init the fancy box once, preferably on page load
[19:55:28] <entrada> then trigger it using the .open method
[19:57:33] <Gambit-> so if I'm trying to design a relatively clean API, would it be reasonable given a user and an address class (1:many), to have some form of http://example.com/user/<UID>/address or http://example.com/user/<UID>/address/<AID>?
[19:59:08] <ui> the 2nd might conflict if the user puts <AID> in the address
[19:59:32] <entrada> 2nd is good
[19:59:35] <teear> Mr. SystemFault nice to see ya
[19:59:36] <ui> no, let me rephrase it--
[20:00:14] <ui> if the user places at the end of the address a string which has same syntax as the AID, your system won't be able to distinguish between whether it's part of the address or an AID, will it?
[20:00:27] <teear> Remember when we where drinking beer and making bugs?
[20:01:22] <entrada> ui: it will.. most app frameworks come with a sufficiently intelligent router
[20:01:40] <ui> ok.
[20:01:46] <teear> You're one hot mama
[20:02:56] <systemfault> Oh myâ€¦ #jquery is flooded by idiots tonight..
[20:03:07] <ui> sorry for not knowing that
[20:05:27] <systemfault> Gambit-: It depends on your domainâ€¦ But I usually use plural to identify "collections"
[20:05:27] <abjorn> imsky: the name real.js almost makes me want to do it for real
[20:06:07] <teear> You can queery my posh html5-based systemfaulted ninja-app
[20:07:16] <bwq> http://example.com/user/<UID>/addresses
[20:07:19] <bwq> and return json array
[20:07:20] <teear> If I were Chuck Norris I would not have any SystemFaults
[20:07:50] <DreamStiller> hi guys
[20:07:52] <Gambit-> systemfault, evenin'.  So http://example.com/user/<UID>/addresses or http://example.com/user/<UID>/address/<AID>?
[20:07:57] <DreamStiller> let me know when is it my turn
[20:08:06] <teear> Hello ladies
[20:08:10] <bwq> obviously not the second one :)
[20:08:14] <Gambit-> why not the second one?
[20:08:22] <bwq> oh sorry, thought that said "addresses" too
[20:08:27] <Gambit-> oh, nope.
[20:08:27] <bwq> imo it's cleaner to do the first one
[20:08:39] <bwq> they query addresses and you return an array of corresponding addresses
[20:08:50] <bwq> a user is not going to query address by id
[20:08:51] <Gambit-> well the first one is fine for when I want all user addresses, but if I want just a specific address (like, for a POST), then...
[20:08:53] <teear> DreamStiller whadupp
[20:08:56] <bwq> though you could of course allow them to
[20:09:05] <Gambit-> on an update they will.
[20:09:07] <bwq> by passing on an aid variable
[20:09:18] <Gambit-> oh, in the querystring instead of in the uri.
[20:09:45] <bwq> or you could use /address
[20:09:54] <bwq> and default (empty) return all of them
[20:10:02] <bwq> and if a aid is specified, return that
[20:10:03] <systemfault> Gambit-: http://example.com/users/<UID>/addresses would return all addresses and http://example.com/users/<UID>/addresses/<AID> would return a specific oneâ€¦ so both
[20:10:14] <bwq> yup
[20:10:18] <Gambit-> well addresses are only valid within the domain of a larger container - a user or some other entity.
[20:10:32] <DreamStiller> newb here. kindly have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/38gaL/ but dont worry bout the result
[20:10:35] <entrada> a classic restful url
[20:10:39] <Gambit-> okay, good
[20:10:41] <DreamStiller> as the resut projected is not useful
[20:10:46] <Gambit-> danke
[20:10:51] <Gambit-> this is so slow going right now :/
[20:10:53] <teear> DreamStiller, Your answer is this: http://yle.fi/extrem/popular.php
[20:10:55] <systemfault> Gambit-: If the user is the aggregate root, my scheme would be good
[20:11:04] <bwq> how come? :p
[20:11:21] <Gambit-> systemfault, your scheme is my scheme is bwq's scheme, ne?
[20:11:29] <DreamStiller> teear that wasnt ice
[20:11:29] <systemfault> Gambit-: I think so
[20:11:31] <DreamStiller> *nice
[20:11:36] <Gambit-> k
[20:11:40] <imsky> abjorn, aw yeah
[20:11:43] <teear> No it was hotter than that :D
[20:11:59] <imsky> abjorn, i'm out for the night amigo, lates
[20:13:47] <jonkersjoe> hi, if I use .css to add css to an element. How do I remove that css  ?
[20:14:56] <teear> backspace
[20:20:06] <teear> You need to be more specific, but backspace is a general solution
[20:21:08] <entrada> jonkersjoe: use .css again to set the property to blank
[20:21:32] <entrada> example: .css('color', 'black') and .css('color', '')
[20:22:00] <teear> .css { color: transparent; }
[20:23:22] <teear> Is there none for color?
[20:24:45] <teear> What is the default value?
[20:26:12] <richthegeek> hi, I've got an odd setup with UI.sortable wherein there are two connected lists and one of them is zoomed (css zoom: 0.6). Understandably the zoom is affecting the accuracy of the sortable's believed position
[20:26:41] <richthegeek> anyone know how to account for that? the stack overflow answers I found point to a drag function in the config, but it's not firing
[20:32:12] <richthegeek> for anyone interested, using css transform:scale(0.6) instead of zoom works better (mouse positions are accounted for properly) but it does look worse (too much anti-aliasing everywhere)
[20:34:07] <richthegeek> also, appending the helper (type=clone) to a non-zoomed area helps a lot with various weirdness
[20:35:04] <rodyhaddad> deferred objects are awesome :D
[20:35:47] <entrada> richthegeek: good learning! thanks!
[20:35:55] <entrada> rodyhaddad: they are, :D
[20:36:27] <rodyhaddad> I fell in love with them, everyone should know about them!
[20:36:29] <richthegeek> entrada: only minor issue is the slightly worse browser support for transform over scale i think - this needs to be tested cross browser... but it's a backend UI thing so I can at least enforce the browser to a degree
[20:37:03] <entrada> richthegeek: true, but if you can just *not* zoom in older browsers, it should be fine
[20:37:26] <entrada> richthegeek: graceful degradation and all that
[20:37:33] <richthegeek> entrada: yeah, it's something i need to test properly but for now the software is formally "beta" stuff
[20:38:04] <entrada> richthegeek: transform the hell out, i say! :D
[20:42:28] <richthegeek> aww that makes me somewhat sad... "massive" software project is only 2800 SLOC
[20:42:38] <richthegeek> part of me thinks "yay i write efficient code"
[20:42:49] <richthegeek> but sometimes I *want* a monolith of gargantuan proportions
[20:42:57] <Gambit-> you're in totally the wrong channel for that statement, RichardP_
[20:42:59] <Gambit-> er, richardwhiuk
[20:43:01] <Gambit-> god damn it
[20:43:03] <Gambit-> richthegeek
[20:43:10] <richthegeek> lol, sorry, i'll keep the OT chat to a min
[20:43:13] <Gambit-> oh, no
[20:43:26] <Gambit-> I was just ragging on anything related to 'javascript' being classed as 'efficient code'
[20:43:38] <richthegeek> oh haha, no it's 2800 in coffeescript
[20:43:56] <richthegeek> it's 9100 in JS
[20:44:00] <Gambit-> I know nothing about coffeescript.
[20:44:06] <Gambit-> and I'm only learning js.
[20:44:08] <thomedy> okay is ther e a way to simulate a callback for the .css()
[20:44:17] <Gambit-> but my day job is high performance C programming, so... yeah.
[20:44:25] <entrada> @thomedy  just put it after that line
[20:44:33] <thomedy> oh duh
[20:44:35] <thomedy> wait
[20:44:36] <thomedy> no
[20:44:36] <entrada> lol
[20:44:37] <thomedy> sorry
[20:44:39] <thomedy> this is why
[20:44:44] <thomedy> im using css3 transitions
[20:44:50] <entrada> ah
[20:44:53] <thomedy> so it  has  to have  4 second delay
[20:44:55] <richthegeek> Gambit-: well of all the languages to learn, JS is surprisingly fast (20+ times slower than C I believe, compared to stuff like Python which is several hundred times slower)
[20:45:02] <thomedy> i love c
[20:45:07] <thomedy> i was doing c in colllege
[20:45:12] <thomedy> i did robotics in c
[20:45:16] <thomedy> it was dope
[20:45:19] <Whirl3d> thomedy, there's a delay attribute in css3
[20:45:27] <richthegeek> well, that's the first time I've heard C referred to as dope :S
[20:45:31] <entrada> thomedy: use transitionend
[20:45:48] <thomedy> is that a css3 thing
[20:45:50] <thomedy> thank you so  much
[20:45:52] <thomedy> let me google it
[20:46:07] <entrada> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5023514/how-do-i-normalize-css3-transition-functions-across-browsers
[20:46:21] <entrada> see the modernizer way
[20:46:26] <entrada> that's the preferred one
[21:04:55] <Gambit-> richthegeek, my preferred alternate is Lua, but yeah JS v8 is bloody fast.
[21:05:36] <Gambit-> it's too bad there's still no lua-jit in the shootout.
[21:05:40] <richthegeek> i've actually never tried Lua... currently working on a fairly hefty data intel thing using Node though, so will probably be doing some parts of that in "native" eventually
[21:06:02] <Gambit-> lua's just about perfect for 'embed within a C application'.
[21:07:43] <thomedy> so i dont usually use the short version of if statements i just never did
[21:07:48] <thomedy> and i m noticing something in js
[21:07:53] <thomedy>  var transitionend = (isSafari) ? "webkitTransitionEnd" : (isFirefox) ? "transitionEnd" : (isOpera) ? "oTransitionEnd";
[21:07:59] <thomedy> (isSafari)
[21:08:06] <thomedy> that is in paranthesis
[21:08:11] <thomedy> and that is  waht an argument
[21:08:26] <richthegeek> i love it when code works the first time :)
[21:08:29] <thomedy> i get the concept of shorthand but
[21:10:58] <sinusss> hmmm I have posted in Stackoverflow and will be moving forward with other stuff - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11388972/jquery-with-fancybox-on-dynamically-created-elements-only-works-on-the-second-c in case anyone knows the answer and wants more points :P
[21:52:53] <Gambit-> if I do $.getScript("foo.js"), and foo.js at the top of it has 'var Bar = {}', why does Bar show up as undefined when I type 'Bar' in the console?
[21:53:35] <richthegeek> the *solution* is wrapping everything in a ready() cb
[21:53:53] <Gambit-> how's that?
[21:53:55] <richthegeek> the reason is basically a nice "because f*** you" from mr Crockford
[21:54:07] <richthegeek> jQuery(function() { do stuff here })
[21:54:08] * Gambit- looks attentively curious
[21:54:47] <richthegeek> i think possibly the reason is that getScript is running outside of the "window" context (ie, somwhere within jQuery)
[21:55:38] <entrada> Gambit-: put it in the callback
[21:55:50] <entrada> getScript has a callback
[21:56:19] <Gambit-> ooh..
[21:56:40] <Gambit-> should I try to set a global, or should I try to hang it off of jquery somehow?
[21:57:08] <richthegeek> globals are better (well, set a global namespace MyApp and hang everything off that)
[21:57:13] <entrada> depends on your usecase
[21:57:25] <richthegeek> hanging on jQuery has a possibility to conflict with plugins in the future
[21:57:31] <entrada> if its a jQuery plugin or something, you can hang it off
[21:57:39] <entrada> if not, have your own namespace
[21:57:42] <entrada> that's much better
[22:07:55] <Gambit-> entrada, richthegeek, how do you create a namespace, then?
[22:08:04] <richthegeek> window.MyApp = {}
[22:08:12] <Gambit-> ah, always hung off of window?
[22:08:18] <entrada> what richthegeek said
[22:08:25] <richthegeek> yes, window is the toplevel thing
[22:08:29] <richthegeek> well, in a browser at least
[22:08:32] <entrada> Gambit-: thats the root
[22:08:34] <Gambit-> so $.MyApp would be no?
[22:08:39] <entrada> no
[22:08:40] <richthegeek> that'd be hanging it off jQuery
[22:08:54] <Gambit-> I'd be okay with that, given the level of bindings I have in both directions.
[22:09:02] <richthegeek> jQuery is canonically "window.jQuery" and (if noConflict hasn't been called) window.$
[22:09:07] <Gambit-> ahh
[22:09:58] <richthegeek> brb, need to wash out my eye... 20 hours awake and for some reason rubbing my eye means it's now leaking like a excited prostitute
[22:10:11] <coldhead> ew
[22:10:18] <Gambit-> charming
[22:10:33] <coldhead> its probably crying at the similes you use
[22:10:36] <coldhead> AS I AM
[22:10:47] <Gambit-> this is annoying, now it's giving me a ReferenceError, but not telling me where it's from.
[22:11:20] <Gambit-> or why it's undefined... because it was defined.
[22:11:32] <Gambit-> I feel like I'm failing a syntax check somewhere but the console isn't bothering to let me know.
[22:11:45] <coldhead> jshint maybe?
[22:11:57] <Gambit-> what?
[22:13:19] <coldhead> ?jshint
[22:13:19] <bot-t> http://jshint.com/
[22:15:24] <raj> does simulating a click of a submit button work in IE?
[22:15:53] <entrada> raj it does
[22:16:08] <raj> ok, cuz I had issues with File Browser click simulation
[22:16:18] <entrada> ah file browser
[22:16:19] <raj> wanted to make sure I wouldn't have that fiasco again
[22:20:59] <Gambit-> coldhead, it keeps telling me to 'use the function form of "use strict"'.  Wtf is it looking for?  I have "use strict"; at the top of the file.
[22:21:51] <coldhead> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4462478/jslint-is-suddenly-reporting-use-the-function-form-of-use-strict
[22:22:09] <Gambit-> okay, lmgtfy is obviously where I need to be looking :P
[22:22:11] <Gambit-> thanks
[22:23:48] <coldhead> news to me too
[22:23:54] <coldhead> but i don't use strict
[22:23:59] <coldhead> i like it sexy and simple
[22:24:04] <Gambit-> well, I hadn't, but I guess I will.
[22:24:22] <Eviltwin> He likes forgetting var and everything becoming global
[22:26:08] <Gambit-> anyways, none of that actually helped me figure out why my namespaces are screwed up.
[22:33:38] <amirite> is there a way to bind to a <select>'s change before the select loses focus
[22:33:46] <amirite> i.e. when the user keypress's down or up to cycle through
[22:33:53] <amirite> without necessarily binding to keypress either
[22:33:59] <amirite> since that's always messy
[22:34:25] <Eviltwin> Sounds like the event you want might be keypress
[22:34:32] <amirite> you suck
[22:34:56] <Eviltwin> You literally said "when the user keypress's"
[22:35:11] <entrada> amirite: in change event, save the value to data-previous
[22:35:30] <entrada> that's the usual way i do it
[22:35:31] <amirite> change event only fires on blur
[22:35:32] <coldhead> i think whatever alternative you can find will be messier, if there even is such a thing
[22:35:41] <Gambit-> http://jsfiddle.net/URvaV/ <-- shouldn't I be able to do 'window.foo' in the console and get that value back out?
[22:36:10] <Mohsen_Hassani> I'm printing something in javascript and it returns [object Object], how can I get to its actual data?
[22:36:26] <Eviltwin> Gambit-: Except it's run in an iframe which is a different window
[22:36:38] <coldhead> it works outside of jsfiddle, Gambit-
[22:36:39] <Gambit-> I didn't realize that was an iframe, yeah.
[22:36:40] <Eviltwin> Gambit-: If you go to http://jsfiddle.net/URvaV/show/ you should be able to do window.fo
[22:36:45] <Eviltwin> window.foo*
[22:36:52] <Eviltwin> ?alert @ Mohsen_Hassani

[22:37:22] <Gambit-> well that's not a very useful test, then :)

[22:39:34] * amirite poops on eviltwin's face
[22:40:58] <coldhead> now that was uncalled for
[22:41:01] <DreamStiller> so have i waited long enough to get some scripting help here?
[22:41:06] <DreamStiller> been a whole
[22:41:12] <DreamStiller> *while
[22:41:12] <coldhead> we're better than this, people
[22:41:18] <amirite> no dream
[22:41:19] <DreamStiller> YES you ARE!
[22:41:22] <amirite> you need to wait 3 more hours
[22:41:27] <Eviltwin> DreamStiller: Most likely we missed your question
[22:42:18] * amirite kicks eviltwin's ass
[22:42:31] <DreamStiller> as usual i suck with coding..any coding that is..please view http://jsfiddle.net/38gaL/ but do not care about the results view
[22:42:42] <DreamStiller> as my code involves velocity
[22:43:07] <coldhead> its not clear what you want help with, DreamStiller
[22:43:28] <DreamStiller> my problem is...the velocity will create dynamic datas. and i have a problem renaming the button according to the loops
[22:43:53] <DreamStiller> it will return out $Sample_Title instead of for example "Open Here 1"
[22:44:22] <DreamStiller> im not so sure if you get it
[22:44:43] <Eviltwin> Rather that putting server-side markup in the HTML page, it's better to put rendered HTML
[22:44:57] <DreamStiller> ok hold on
[22:44:58] <Eviltwin> So an example of what it might render as
[22:45:06] <Eviltwin> With dummy data in there
[22:45:37] <DreamStiller> ok hold on ya
[22:50:36] <reecefowell> i have been googling for a few days now and trying out different snippets, but i am unable to find a decent 'getSelectedText' method that works (for a textarea wether or not that matters) but nothing seems to work in all browsers. Anyone can help me? just need the highlighted text within a textarea
[22:50:59] <Eviltwin> jQuery doesn't really have anything for working with the text selection
[22:51:12] <Eviltwin> It's a problem I've looked at before and never found a great solution for
[22:51:19] <Eviltwin> At least nothing that works well across browsers
[22:52:18] <entrada> Eviltwin: rangy
[22:52:21] <reecefowell> i use Safari, and its been the biggest issue in this
[22:52:23] <entrada> ?g rangy js

[22:52:43] <entrada> reecefowell: use rangy
[22:52:52] <reecefowell> entrada: thanks, i am looking into it now
[22:53:18] <Eviltwin> It works almost identically in Safari and Chrome as they are both based on WebKit
[22:53:19] <DreamStiller> not what i expected to be generated but try http://jsfiddle.net/KrumJ/
[22:53:26] <Eviltwin> And relatively similar in Firefox
[22:53:53] <mfoxdogg|work> this works quite well, its out of CLEditor (HTML editor) http://www.pasteall.org/33583/javascript
[22:53:54] <DreamStiller> i wonder why the button is still $Spoiler_Title
[22:54:14] <mfoxdogg|work> soirry my response was about selected text
[22:54:24] <reecefowell> Eviltwin: but is webkit not just the layout engine, i thought they use different JS engines?
[22:55:01] <Eviltwin> reecefowell: Safari uses V8 but the JavaScript API is almost identical
[22:55:18] <reecefowell> Eviltwin: Chrome uses V8, safari uses Nitro
[22:55:20] <reecefowell> yeah
[22:55:23] <reecefowell> f/e
[22:56:23] <Eviltwin> They both comply very closely to the W3C spec
[22:56:34] <Eviltwin> With a few additional features that are non-standard
[22:58:23] <coldhead> DreamStiller: http://jsfiddle.net/KrumJ/1/
[22:58:54] <coldhead> i suspect you are trying to use the serverside value $Spoiler_Title in your JS
[22:59:02] <coldhead> but they're different worlds, man
[22:59:20] <coldhead> you need to pass from the server to JS
[22:59:34] <ShizukaMinamoto> Hi, I'm trying to create a responsive site here is the url http://staging.iamknighted.com/ I'm getting weird  output of my post section, can I get some help by fixing what it will display as expected? Thanks
[22:59:49] <DreamStiller> colhead: yes serverside value
[23:00:05] <coldhead> maybe with <input type="hidden" class="lolaids" value="$Spoiler_Title" /> and then var spoiler = $('.lolaids').val();
[23:00:09] <DreamStiller> coldhead: so this cant be done?
[23:00:35] <coldhead> you just need to get $Spoiler_Title somewhere in the page and let JS find and use it
[23:01:18] <ShizukaMinamoto> oksushi: I've used http://staging.iamknighted.com/wp-content/themes/iamknighted/js/grid-a-licious.js inspiring from this site http://www.creativedepart.com/ for the post positioning
[23:01:23] <DreamStiller> hmmm ok i try thank you in advance
[23:01:29] <ShizukaMinamoto> I've used http://staging.iamknighted.com/wp-content/themes/iamknighted/js/grid-a-licious.js inspiring from this site http://www.creativedepart.com/ for the post positioning
[23:03:57] <coldhead> DreamStiller: like this http://jsfiddle.net/KrumJ/2/
[23:15:13] <DreamStiller> didnt quite hit it..im just going to kill self
[23:19:01] <coldhead> its quite a simple thing, once you figure it out
[23:19:06] <coldhead> don't kill yourself
[23:19:12] <coldhead> there are much harder bugs still ahead of you
[23:19:24] <Mohsen_Hassani> I've downloaded a slide show widget, using it I found a function which has a parameter named args. Using console.log() I saw this args has 'attributes' in it. In this 'attribute' there is the ID of the image, I need the ID. How can I get it?
[23:20:42] <coldhead> args.attributes.id ?
[23:23:30] <Mohsen_Hassani> coldhead, args.attributes is undefined
[23:24:39] <DreamStiller> colhead..just an idea. is it possible if i do not put any value yet to the button but only add them once the html is generated?
[23:25:18] <DreamStiller> similar to the one you just provided but good God
[23:25:47] <coldhead> yes that sounds reasonable, DreamStiller
[23:26:03] <coldhead> Mohsen_Hassani: without the code or a working demo i can only guess, i am sorry
[23:27:48] <Mohsen_Hassani> coldhead, no;) I am sorry! for not providing the code ;)

[23:30:00] <teear> Shouldn't you be using masonry?
[23:30:34] <jonkersjoe> ShizukaMinamoto:  hey is the posts the one on the left hand side of the screen, half cut from the view ?
[23:30:52] <xec> ShizukaMinamoto: what does "weird output" mean specifically?
[23:31:03] <teear> ShizukaMinamoto: http://masonry.desandro.com/
[23:33:32] <jonkersjoe> ShizukaMinamoto:  like what xec, said you may need to provide more details. However, if you're trying to fix the posts so that its not half cut off check out the .post-box and .eachpost style which has margin-left and margin-top set. you may need to fix them
[23:34:35] <ShizukaMinamoto> Thanks, jonkersjoe, teear, xec :-)
[23:35:46] <ShizukaMinamoto> Thanks for providing me details regarding http://masonry.desandro.com/ cause I wasn't aware of that thing. In spite of that I was working with this http://staging.iamknighted.com/wp-content/themes/iamknighted/js/grid-a-licious.js which I myself think was the wrong way
