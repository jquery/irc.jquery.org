[00:00:07] <LoneSoldier728> is it going to work in a loop?
[00:00:10] <LoneSoldier728> to match it...
[00:00:33] <LoneSoldier728> {title: /^\#/}
[00:00:38] <LoneSoldier728> it is that right?
[00:00:59] <Cork> yes
[00:01:14] <LoneSoldier728> basically i am matching two arrays, and I want to say if the first array matches or contains that title to remove it
[00:01:16] <Cork> LoneSoldier728: that depends on what you plan on using it for
[00:01:21] <LoneSoldier728> it does not seem to work with that
[00:01:30] <weeb1e> Does anyone know of any shorter alternative of doing the following? $($('.foo').filter(function() { return $(this).find('a') })[0])
[00:02:04] <LoneSoldier728> here let me show u code
[00:02:09] <Cork> $('.foo a').closest('.foo')
[00:03:25] <LoneSoldier728> http://pastebin.com/NtEn2gS0
[00:03:27] <LoneSoldier728> there
[00:03:30] <LoneSoldier728> so basically
[00:03:42] <weeb1e> Cork: That wouldn't work if there is no a in the first place
[00:03:44] <LoneSoldier728> i took away artist to make it more simple actually
[00:03:47] <LoneSoldier728> ignore it in the code
[00:04:00] <Cork> weeb1e: nether would your
[00:04:09] <weeb1e> Cork: Not at all true...
[00:04:22] <weeb1e> Cork: It selects all .foo's that have no a child element
[00:04:22] <Cork> weeb1e: you remove all .foo that doens't have any a in them
[00:04:37] <weeb1e> Cork: The opposite
[00:04:50] <Cork> then you would need return !$(this).find('a')
[00:05:05] <Cork> actuially that line is always true
[00:05:06] <Cork> so...
[00:05:38] <Cork> $($('.foo').filter(function() { return $(this).find('a').length < 0; })[0]) would work
[00:05:45] <Cork> uh
[00:05:48] <Cork> $($('.foo').filter(function() { return $(this).find('a').length < 1; })[0]) would work
[00:06:02] <weeb1e> So there is no shorter solution then
[00:06:23] <Cork> css isn't meant to match child element
[00:06:35] <Cork> $('
[00:06:37] <Cork> opps
[00:06:48] <weeb1e> Ok, I will have to settle with $($(".teams .team-ct .player").filter(function() { return !$(this).find('a').length })[0])
[00:06:56] <LoneSoldier728> Cork any clue?
[00:06:58] <Cork> $('.foo').not($('.foo a').closest('.foo'))
[00:07:20] <weeb1e> Which is pretty ugly, I was just hoping jquery had another traversal function, I guess I could implement one
[00:07:38] <Cork> LoneSoldier728: o:for isn't valid js
[00:07:48] <LoneSoldier728> it is a label
[00:07:50] <LoneSoldier728> it works heh
[00:07:51] <Deele> Cork I have a problem. I created a plugin that creates element and I have defined action on event - when that fires, I remove element created by plugin, but after that, I cannot call my plugin again "TypeError: $(...).myPlugin is not a function"
[00:07:53] <Cork> ugg...
[00:07:58] <Cork> ah
[00:08:04] * Cork shivers a bit
[00:08:23] <weeb1e> Cork: Well that would work too, but it seems less efficient
[00:08:23] <LoneSoldier728> heh, ya
[00:08:42] <weeb1e> Cork: I'm really surprised jquery has no traversal function that returns the first matched element
[00:08:47] <Cork> weeb1e: no that does two dom selections you do O^2
[00:08:54] <LoneSoldier728> disregarding that how do i get that to match, it is the last thing I need to get done for this project before i can put it onto github opensource! : )
[00:09:19] <weeb1e> Cork: Ok you are right, I'll settle with that, thanks
[00:09:21] <Deele> how is it so, that $.fn.myPlugin is not defined anymore - I didn't knew, if that is even possible
[00:09:50] <Cork> ?mdn regex test
[00:09:51] <b-ot> Cork: RegExp - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
[00:09:55] <Cork> LoneSoldier728: ^
[00:10:07] <Cork> you would have to run the regex onthe value
[00:10:29] <Cork> weeb1e: if you use jquery i would use $.grep instead
[00:10:36] <Cork> would make the code cleaner
[00:10:46] <weeb1e> Cork: I'll take a look at that, never used that function before
[00:11:04] <weeb1e> I am looking to shorten the code, performance is not so important for this specific selection
[00:11:04] <Cork> weeb1e: it was for LoneSoldier728
[00:11:17] <weeb1e> Argh
[00:12:56] <Cork> LoneSoldier728: if it matches remove it from where?
[00:13:55] <LoneSoldier728> it removes it from the array
[00:14:05] <LoneSoldier728> I have it working if I can give it an exact match
[00:14:11] <Cork> witch one of the two arrays?
[00:14:17] <LoneSoldier728> but now I want to say if the title is not exact but close enough
[00:14:23] <Cork> the original one, and leave the new one alone?
[00:14:35] <LoneSoldier728> basically if you are looking at the code
[00:14:39] <LoneSoldier728> the new one
[00:14:50] <LoneSoldier728> pushes all the values that are not true for the match
[00:14:53] <Cork> and the new one is remove?
[00:14:55] <LoneSoldier728> so z has
[00:14:56] <Cork> or arr?
[00:14:58] <LoneSoldier728> all the result
[00:15:16] <LoneSoldier728> and r is the array with the value that if matched from the arr - named arr
[00:15:26] <LoneSoldier728> is skipped instead of being pushed
[00:15:28] <LoneSoldier728> into the new array
[00:15:42] <Cork> i see what the code does, but i don't see what's sent to it
[00:15:45] <Cork> that is what i need
[00:15:59] <Cork> to understand the flow of the function
[00:15:59] <LoneSoldier728> oh
[00:16:21] <Cork> (i don't need the data, just what the data is)
[00:16:46] <LoneSoldier728> ok ya sorry well what is sent is http://pastebin.com/84e4e7dV
[00:16:53] <LoneSoldier728> the results list that is scraped originally
[00:16:57] <LoneSoldier728> its is a 150 songs
[00:17:07] <LoneSoldier728> with a title: and an artist
[00:17:12] <Cork> ah
[00:17:19] <LoneSoldier728> so that list is sent as array - arr
[00:17:31] <LoneSoldier728> and then array remove is the thing that I am trying to match
[00:17:36] <LoneSoldier728> and array z is the new array
[00:17:37] <Cork> so what matches the value in remove should be removed from result_list and returned to the function?
[00:17:44] <LoneSoldier728> that puts values that do not match remove
[00:18:21] <LoneSoldier728> ya and at the end what is returned is the new array z with everything pushed from arr ecept what matchd iin remove aka changed it to variable r
[00:19:01] <LoneSoldier728> calling continue to move back to the label o
[00:19:12] <LoneSoldier728> so it skips it from being pushed and goes to the next value
[00:19:13] <LoneSoldier728> in the array
[00:19:36] <LoneSoldier728> so now, I want to somehow specify that title: whatever should be in the remove array
[00:19:41] <LoneSoldier728> and anything matching it should be removed
[00:20:09] <LoneSoldier728> so essentially the title will be matched with items being looped through the array arr
[00:21:26] <Cork> LoneSoldier728: so $.grep(arr, function(v) { var match = true; $.each(remove, function(key, value) { if(!v[key].test(value)) { match = false; return false; } return match; }); })
[00:21:36] <Cork> uh... no
[00:21:42] <Cork> LoneSoldier728: so $.grep(arr, function(v) { var match = true; $.each(remove, function(key, value) { if(!v[key].test(value)) { match = false; return false; } }); return match; })
[00:21:52] <LoneSoldier728> it is not jquery tho
[00:22:03] <Cork> then why are you asking in jquery?
[00:22:20] <LoneSoldier728> well it is js, and there is no regex
[00:22:26] <LoneSoldier728> group
[00:22:45] <Cork> well there is a ##javascript
[00:23:06] <LoneSoldier728> how did u match it in
[00:23:10] <LoneSoldier728> jquery tho anyways?
[00:23:40] <LoneSoldier728> i dont see regex or anything eluding to the #?
[00:24:12] <Cork> LoneSoldier728: http://jsfiddle.net/62bLG/
[00:24:26] <Cork> LoneSoldier728: well you are passing remove in with the regex
[00:24:34] <Cork> and the test is on line 5
[00:24:55] <Cork> though the wrong way around >_<
[00:24:57] <LoneSoldier728> so the way i wrote the regex is correct?
[00:25:08] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/62bLG/1/
[00:25:12] <Cork> yes
[00:25:20] <Cork> ...
[00:25:21] <LoneSoldier728> does {title: /^\#BPM/},
[00:25:24] <Cork> man i typo a lot now
[00:25:28] <LoneSoldier728> this allow for characters and spaces
[00:25:30] <LoneSoldier728> after it too?
[00:25:40] <jphase> (.*) at the end?
[00:25:53] <LoneSoldier728> after the slash?
[00:25:55] <Cork> you don't have a limit on the length
[00:26:11] <LoneSoldier728> so it should be fine just that way
[00:26:16] <LoneSoldier728> it can have  skfjskf dfk jsk f
[00:26:19] <LoneSoldier728> after no prob?
[00:26:37] <Cork> js> print(/^/#BPM/.test('#BPMasdlhsdkfhskdfhskjdhfjksdhf'))
[00:26:42] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[00:26:44] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: you should get a regex tool like "Reggy" for mac or one of those simple ones that aren't too gnarly
[00:26:54] <Cork> js> print(/^\#BPM/.test('#BPMasdlhsdkfhskdfhskjdhfjksdhf'))
[00:27:00] <b-ot> Cork: true
[00:27:15] <jphase> js> print(/^/#BPM(.*)/.test('#BPMasdlhsdkfhskdfhskjdhfjksdhf'))
[00:27:20] <b-ot> jphase: No output.
[00:27:23] <jphase> doh
[00:27:24] <Cork> no need for the () match
[00:27:36] <Cork> he only want's to know if the first three character matches
[00:27:42] <jphase> oic
[00:27:45] * jphase jumped in too late into this anyhow, I should shutup
[00:27:56] <LoneSoldier728> yeah
[00:28:03] <LoneSoldier728> someone told me that it might be
[00:28:05] <DRSK> <img class="test" data-something="url" src="url2" />    :: $( 'img.test' ).attr( 'data-something' ) <-- how can I switch so that data-something is the src?
[00:28:11] <LoneSoldier728> that i am trying to equate
[00:28:17] <LoneSoldier728> a regex expression
[00:28:19] <LoneSoldier728> to the value
[00:28:22] <LoneSoldier728> am i doing that wrong?
[00:28:31] <LoneSoldier728> r[x].title==arr[i].title
[00:28:39] <LoneSoldier728> r[x].title being the regex
[00:28:41] <LoneSoldier728> expression
[00:28:46] <_rgn> read how to use regexes
[00:28:55] <Cork> DRSK: var img = img.attr('src', img.data('something'))
[00:28:58] <_rgn> that's not how you match a regexp
[00:29:04] <LoneSoldier728> right i know
[00:29:10] <LoneSoldier728> i just realized that
[00:29:20] <DRSK> Cork » thanks, exactly what I was looking for
[00:29:50] <Cork> DRSK: * var img = $('img.test'); img.attr('src', img.data('something'))
[00:30:06] <DRSK> yeah I figured as much :D thanks
[00:30:31] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/q4nwgtnkrwpenqkok3aiua - shouldn't data be what I return from /texts/add ?
[00:30:39] <Cork> my head seams i bit fuzzy today, i keep typoing like mad...
[00:31:12] <Cork> nisseni: yes
[00:31:32] <LoneSoldier728> thanks guys
[00:31:34] <LoneSoldier728> it works now
[00:31:45] <LoneSoldier728> had to just do .match() and throw the array in there
[00:51:57] <DRSK> Cork » I need some advice. I have 3 backgrounds and then 3 thumbs to switch between them. However, each background has 1 alternative version, so in fact there's 6. At the moment, I have <img src="version1" data-other="version2" /> then based on yet another nav I switch between v1 and v2. Should I be doing this in some other, perhaps easier, way?
[00:53:01] <Cork> drager: <img src="pic.png">  and then you could do <img src="pic-large.png">
[00:53:09] <Cork> that way you won't need any extra variable at all
[00:53:12] <Cork> uh..
[00:53:14] <Cork> *DRSK:
[00:53:35] <Cork> DRSK: though the data-other is ok too, i would prob do that my self
[00:54:11] <Cork> alternatively if you use the second image in css, you could just handle it from css and use a class
[00:56:23] <DRSK> Cork » right well the bg's are dynamically inserted, you mean e.g. having the image twice as wide and switch the x post?
[00:56:28] <DRSK> erm, position*
[00:56:38] <Cork> DRSK: no
[00:57:05] <Cork> DRSK: you could have classes for each image and specify the second set of images there
[00:57:18] <Cork> though that only works as long as you have a fairly fixed set of images
[00:57:28] <Cork> else the data- solution is prob the simplest
[00:57:33] <DRSK> ohh now I get it, right yeah I gotcha.
[00:58:13] <DRSK> Cork » the issue I'm having is "toggling" between src and other and back again
[00:58:48] <Cork> img.data('org', img.attr('src')); img.attr('src', img.data('other))
[00:59:30] <DRSK> Cork » oh you mean I set up yet another data value to hold ver1, another for v2 and switch src to either v1 or v2?
[00:59:40] <Cork> yes
[00:59:55] <Cork> or like i said, you could just use a static part in the url
[01:00:14] <DRSK> image-v1, image-v2 and just switch the latter?
[01:00:33] <Cork> img.attr('src', img.data('other').replace('/\{part\}/, 'v1'))
[01:00:39] <Cork> img.attr('src', img.data('other').replace('/\{part\}/, 'v2'))
[01:00:47] <Cork> ya
[01:00:52] <DRSK> ah, right I get it. Thanks for explaining and giving me alternatives!
[01:18:48] <Lann> I'm doing a .each call on a javascript object that looks like {mykey1: Array[1], mykey2: Array[1]} …why does the key evalate to "true" instead of 'mykey1' ?
[01:25:21] <ph88> can i access html data- attributes directly with jquery or do i have to use the attr() method ?
[01:29:03] <phrearch> hey
[01:30:08] <phrearch> if using a click event like $('.foo') on <div class='foo'><p></p></div>, why is it that e.target returns the p when i click on it? i used return false and e.stopPropagation()
[01:31:58] <Cork> phrearch: cause event.target is the event that got the original event
[01:32:07] <Cork> phrearch: this is the element you bound the event on
[01:32:45] <Cork> phrearch: the reason you can get the click event in div event when you click on p is cause event bubbles up the dom tree
[01:32:45] <phrearch> Cork: should i use e.currentTarget or?
[01:32:52] <Cork> no use "this"
[01:33:20] <phrearch> got it. thanks!
[01:47:12] <BrazenBraden> when you do $('#element').children(); it runs through all the children no matter how many layers of nesting there are correct?
[01:47:26] <Cork> no
[01:47:36] <BrazenBraden> just one level down?
[01:47:39] <Cork> it only returns the direct decedent
[01:47:53] <Cork> if you want to look in the child tree use .find()
[01:48:03] <BrazenBraden> ok cool
[01:48:19] <moomoohk> hey guys
[01:48:36] <moomoohk> i'm having some trouble
[01:48:51] <DRSK> Oh wow Adobe got hacked, badly.
[01:49:31] <moomoohk> i've got a div with class "thm-dark". in the css thm-dark has background-color: #333
[01:49:38] <moomoohk> i'm trying to run "$(".thm-dark").css("background-color","rgba(0, 0, 0, 0");"
[01:49:42] <moomoohk> to make it transparent
[01:49:45] <moomoohk> but it's not working
[01:49:50] <moomoohk> am i doing anything wrong?
[01:50:14] <Cork> DRSK: again, or do you mean that from last week?
[01:50:42] <Cork> "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0");" <--
[01:50:53] <Cork> "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);" should work
[01:51:04] <moomoohk> oh my god
[01:51:11] <moomoohk> if it does i'll kick myself
[01:51:33] <Cork> though the ; isn't needed there
[01:51:56] <moomoohk> there's another line in the css but it's not an issue
[01:51:59] <moomoohk> also that didn't work
[01:52:14] <Cork> moomoohk: also rgba(0, 0, 0, 0) is the same as transparent
[01:52:29] <moomoohk> yeah i tried that too
[01:52:44] <Cork> and $(".thm-dark").length > 0 ?
[01:53:00] <DRSK> Cork » Oh I don't know, recieved an email from Adobe today. This is really bad ;p
[01:53:00] <moomoohk> i don't follow
[01:53:19] <moomoohk> i ran that in the console it's giving me 0
[01:53:23] <Cork> DRSK: sounds like the aftermath from what happened last week then
[01:53:33] <Cork> moomoohk: so that is why the line doens't do anything
[01:53:36] <moomoohk> but when i inspect the div it shows that it's getting styled using thm-dark
[01:53:42] <Cork> moomoohk: you don't have that class in the page
[01:53:59] <Cork> moomoohk: can you pb the html for that element?
[01:54:02] <moomoohk> would it be different if the div were in an iframe?
[01:54:06] <moomoohk> because it is
[01:54:39] <moomoohk> i'll upload the code, one sec
[01:55:19] <moomoohk> https://gist.github.com/moomoohk/2581f3817821874ae5bb#file-widget-html-L40
[01:56:02] <moomoohk> i'm trying to restyle the official twitter widget
[01:56:11] <moomoohk> line 41 works (changing the text color in the widget)
[01:56:24] <moomoohk> but line 40 (changing the background color) doesn't
[01:57:05] <moomoohk> the bulk of that code is waiting for the widget's iframe and its contents to get loaded
[01:57:37] <augustl> hey folks. Having some problems with connectToSortable. It doesn't work (tm) :) The UI does not change, and no "stop" event is triggered in the sortable, etc. I checked that the selector is correct, and if I do jQuery(theSelector).sortable("option") when I create the draggable, I get the options for the sortable, so it has been initialized. Any suggestions
[01:57:37] <augustl> for what I can check to debug this?
[01:57:51] <augustl> also, the sortable itself work, and the draggable itself works, it's just connectToSortable that seems to be no-op
[01:59:08] <augustl> there doesn't seem to be any events related to connectToSortable that I can use
[02:02:43] <augustl> just upgraded to the latest version of jQuery UI, that didn't help
[02:03:11] <moomoohk> Cork: i got it :D
[02:10:39] <DRSK> Cork » can I select a specific element based on a data value? E.g. $( '.cls' ).data( 'something' == 'value' ) ?
[02:11:02] <DRSK> or do I have to break it up, get the data, check it for my value then do stuff?
[02:11:12] <Cork> DRSK: not if you use .data()
[02:11:21] <Cork> if you use attr('data-.....') you can
[02:11:36] <Cork> $('[data-something=""]')
[02:11:41] <DRSK> oh right
[02:12:12] <Cork> cause .data() is only loosely related to the attribute value
[02:22:44] <harpal> I have an image. I would like to do that if mouse hover to that image it start rotating slowly and then rotate fast. When mouse out it stops slowly. Can anyone have any idea how to do that?

[02:46:05] <tomato> hello, how do you stub a function that gets added through a requirejs dependancy?  considering the initial stub is a jquery stub
[02:46:12] <tomato> or even spy
[02:46:15] <tomato> or anything
[02:53:19] <tankblergh> hey hey! quick question, is there anyone here with experience with the _.without() function in underscore.js? I'm trying to return a copy of a boolean array with just the "true" values. But instead of reducing the array size, it just makes a same size array and replaces "false" values with null
[02:54:08] <tankblergh> looks like it shouldn't do that, according to the documentation
[02:55:11] <_rgn> tankblergh: you could use _.compact
[02:55:36] <Cork> or $.grep :)
[02:55:36] <tankblergh> ah yes
[02:55:40] <tankblergh> that looks perfect
[02:55:42] <tankblergh> thanks!
[03:20:13] <^^jql^^> hello there. I built a very easy slider based on that the main image gets its path of the thumbnail image clicked. Now I'd like to add a next button, but not sure how to get it with this structure: http://jsfiddle.net/q9xt4/
[03:44:05] <MindSpark> hi, is each() slow?
[03:45:09] <JacquesBH> Hi guys! I've a little question about the data parameters. like data-foo="bar" you know. Is it possible to get all elements with a specific data using selectors? Like $('div[data-foo="bar"]') ?
[03:47:54] <JacquesBH> Ok I've. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1009485/jquery-filter-element-based-on-data-key-value :')
[03:49:36] <Cork> MindSpark: no, it isn't
[03:49:47] <Cork> MindSpark: .each is basically just a for loop
[03:50:38] <MindSpark> Cork: alright, yea, that's what I thought. I mean jq internally does a for loop on the matched set of elements anyway if I am to apply addClass or css for exampl, right?
[03:51:05] <MindSpark> I mean there would be no difference in performance whether I use each or css and addclass, right?
[03:51:13] <Cork> MindSpark: yes, when that is what needs to be done to do the core dom actions
[03:51:35] <Cork> MindSpark: well it isn't that easy to say
[03:51:51] <Cork> MindSpark: some of those classes do work before the loop to speed them up
[03:52:02] <Cork> *cases
[04:00:51] <treeprogram> I'm trying to select an element with an id name that matches my object's property name. The id/property name is "thisid". When I evoke the name directly, like $("#thisid"), it works, but when I use:  for (var name in myObj) {..  $("'#"+name+"'"... }, it gives me the following error: Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: "#thisid". Any pointers on why?
[04:04:22] <gregf_> hi Object.keys somehow does not work on ie8 . is there a way to get around this please?
[04:05:00] <Cork> treeprogram: $('#' + name)
[04:05:18] <gregf_> ah nevrmind
[04:05:20] <treeprogram> Cork: ok, thanks. Why is that? Shouldn't there be quotes around it?
[04:05:34] <Cork> gregf_: ie doesn't support those new js functions until newer versions
[04:05:51] <Cork> treeprogram: the quotes are for strings
[04:06:01] <Cork> if you have the string in a variable you already have the string
[04:06:07] <gregf_> Cork: apparently :/. Thanks
[04:06:09] <treeprogram> Cork: got it thanks
[04:06:31] <Cork> gregf_: there is shims for ie though
[04:06:45] <Cork> (based around loops)
[04:07:06] <singh_abhinav> any pointers on why reading  JSON file with relative path is not working here http://paste.ubuntu.com/6217537/
[04:07:36] <Cork> singh_abhinav: how would we be able to tell from that pb?
[04:08:06] <Cork> singh_abhinav: though relative paths is a pain, as it is a bit of a trick keep track of what path is the relative one
[04:08:17] <Cork> it is normally better to use absolute urls
[04:10:23] <singh_abhinav> Cork:  I meant to ask is there known issue with getJSON with relative paths  :) ..anyway i will put my sample code on pb
[04:10:48] <Cork> singh_abhinav: js don't care it is just strings to it
[04:10:59] <Cork> the browser builds the absolute url from the relative url though
[04:11:22] <Cork> and no the accept type of the request doesn't affect how the browser handles the url
[04:25:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: you know james smith ?
[04:25:43] <lemonsparrow> Cork: https://github.com/loopj
[04:26:03] <Cork> lemonsparrow: don't think so no
[04:26:27] <lemonsparrow> Cork: he's the guy behind token input token slider and so on...
[04:26:31] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://loopj.com/
[04:27:45] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I would like to see your github page... :) can you share
[04:28:08] <Cork> i don't use github much
[04:28:21] <Cork> so it is basically only clones from other projects
[04:28:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok... but I expect something great from people like you.. especially in the areas of front end
[04:29:18] <Cork> lemonsparrow: most of what i do isn't on github
[04:29:33] <lemonsparrow> Cork: hmm... a hidden hero :)
[04:29:51] <Cork> well i create a control interface for the company i work for
[04:29:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: cool...
[04:30:02] <Cork> (hosting company)
[04:30:39] <chocobanana> Hi everyone!!!
[04:30:40] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I guess your company supports and promotes open source a lot.. else they wouldn't have let you be in irc every time ;)
[04:30:51] <lemonsparrow> chocobanana: I just had a chocobanana shake
[04:31:00] <chocobanana> :)
[04:31:11] <Cork> lemonsparrow: actually no, they use opensource for the hosting, but not much else
[04:31:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: but they atleast let you be around in irc 24*7
[04:31:41] <chocobanana> Does anyone know how to use jQuery to control a YouTube clip already embedded in HTML inside an iframe tag?
[04:31:52] <Cork> lemonsparrow: sure, so?
[04:32:06] <lemonsparrow> Cork: kinda most of the time.. active :)
[04:32:19] <Cork> well i code at the same time :)
[04:32:45] <lemonsparrow> Cork: you are great anyways I know... you need not mention that
[04:32:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: :)
[04:33:11] <Cork> chocobanana: most likely you can't
[04:33:12] <lemonsparrow> chocobanana: https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference?csw=1#Playback_controls
[04:33:58] <Cork> chocobanana: as the frame is loaded from a third domain the parent page isn't allowed to talk directly with the content of the page (the browser prevents it)
[04:34:27] <Cork> chocobanana: so you would have to use the api the service provides (if there is one), and route it over there servers
[04:34:34] <^^jql^^> hello there. I built a very easy slider based on that the main image gets its path of the thumbnail image clicked. Now I'd like to add a next button, but not sure how to get it with this structure: http://jsfiddle.net/q9xt4/
[04:40:50] <Cork> ^^jql^^: please make the example a working example
[04:44:56] <chocobanana> cork, lemonsparrow: That's a bummer. I guess I'll have to resort to creating the player with JS. Thanks for your answers!
[04:52:54] <Davy_> hi, i'm trying to vertically center a number of images. It works, but it sets the height to all the images instead of each seperate. I thought if i put it in an .each() that it would solve it but it didn't http://pastebin.com/4jprfRbb
[04:53:35] <Cork> Davy_: you can vertically center things without using js
[04:53:51] <Cork> ?g css dead center
[04:53:52] <b-ot> Cork: Exactly Center an Image/Div Horizontally and Vertically | CSS-Tricks → http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/exactly-center-an-imagediv-horizontally-and-vertically/
[04:54:08] <Cork> <_<
[04:54:48] <Cork> http://www.wpdfd.com/editorial/thebox/deadcentre4.html
[04:55:10] <Cork> first time i've noticed that he has misspelled center :)
[04:55:42] <Davy_> they don't have a fixed width/height
[04:56:02] <Cork> they don't have to
[04:56:03] <Davy_> some are vertical, other are horizontal so i have to calculate it one by one
[04:56:28] <Davy_> says it on the site: Only works with elements of a fixed height/width.
[04:56:29] <Cork> though in some cases you will have to use css3
[04:56:45] <Cork> ya, they don't use transform there
[04:57:07] <Davy_> still like to know why jquery doesn't use the .each function
[04:57:14] <Davy_> or why i misniterpreted it
[04:57:24] <Davy_> misunderstood*
[04:57:44] <Cork> Davy_: $('.slide img').* that you do will always work with the first element in the set
[04:57:54] <Cork> not the one from your each loop
[04:58:14] <Cork> $(this) is the current iteration
[04:58:49] <Cork> so basically you loop the number of images you have and set them based on the first one in the set (every one each loop)
[04:59:21] <Davy_> then how would you go trough each id? seems weird
[04:59:55] <Cork> read my comments
[05:01:19] <Davy_> wich comments?
[05:01:53] <Cork> the comments about what you are doing, and what you should be doing, in here the last 6 line i've typed
[05:02:41] <Davy_> yeah i understand what i'm doing wrong but don't see how it would work then
[05:02:48] <Davy_> but i'll figure it out
[05:02:52] <Davy_> thanks for the explination
[05:03:09] <Cork> <Cork> Davy_: $('.slide img').* that you do will always work with the first element in the set | <Cork> not the one from your each loop | <Cork> $(this) is the current iteration
[05:06:54] <kpl> In $(document).ready(function{}) I make two $.get() calls. One gets a value that the other will use as parameter. How can I make sure I get the value before I use it? Call the second in the success callback of the the first?
[05:07:42] <kpl> Or use some other chaining mechanism?
[05:08:57] <Cork> kpl: yes that is the simplest solution
[05:09:14] <Cork> chaining isn't really possible as it is async
[05:09:38] <Cork> though you can use deferred for the callbacks if you like
[05:13:23] <singh_abhinav> Cork:  this is link of sample code  http://paste.ubuntu.com/6217759/     ..i am just wondering why json file is not getting read by providing relative path
[05:14:08] <Cork> singh_abhinav: ah, that explains it
[05:14:36] <Cork> singh_abhinav: firefox doesn't allow you to go outside the folder the loading html file was loaded from when you run from file://
[05:14:57] <Cork> (you should use a webserver when you develop as file is not a good source for develop a website)
[05:15:49] <Cork> best solution is to set up a small lamp/wamp (depending on your os) and run from that
[05:17:04] <singh_abhinav> Cork:  problem is this is just sample code .i have to run actual code in Android web view ..so I was just wondering if it is possible with file://
[05:17:25] <Cork> singh_abhinav: what your doing there isn't allowed in firefox
[05:17:47] <singh_abhinav> yeah I got that Cork
[05:17:49] <Cork> web view might allow it, but i honestly hope not
[05:18:08] <Cork> as that would mean a web view could grab your password file or what ever and send it
[05:18:56] <singh_abhinav> Cork:  no web view will also not allow it  ..i was just testing it in firefox ..so if its not working in firefox ..it will not work in webview also ... yeah i got the problem Cork :)
[05:20:06] <_oiseaux> Hi all, http://jsfiddle.net/8Ejvn/ <--- If I make t.bar the function that loads of DOM ready, then of course it returns undefined because this is bound to the document (or window??) object. But, if I change the last line to: $(t.bar.bind(t)) to change the value of this, it works - but $() should only except a function reference, right? How the hell can this work?
[05:22:09] <Cork> uh
[05:22:30] <Cork> _oiseaux: $(function() { t.bar() })
[05:22:58] <Cork> _oiseaux: if you send the function as a reference to jquery the reference to the object will be lost
[05:23:59] <^^jql^^> hello Cork. Sorry but I can't make run the slider on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/q9xt4/
[05:24:03] <_oiseaux> Right, so t gets lost, only bar() as a function remains?
[05:24:22] <Cork> yes
[05:24:28] <Cork> well no not really
[05:24:39] <Cork> a reference to the anonymous function is left
[05:24:41] <Cork> bar isn't
[05:24:55] <_oiseaux> But also, how come the bind method works? Because bind returns a reference to the function block of bar, but with the value of this changed?
[05:25:02] <_oiseaux> yeah, gotcha
[05:25:12] <Cork> _oiseaux: cause it binds the this variable
[05:25:29] <Cork> that was why it was added in js1.5 (not supported by all browsers)
[05:25:54] <_oiseaux> Cork: I was concerned that a function call is not a function reference... but maybe JS evaluates the method first?
[05:26:34] <_oiseaux> so t.bar.bind(t) returns an anon function with this = t. Yeah ok that makes sense
[05:26:39] <Cork> _oiseaux: there is function declarations and function statements, the first is done as a primary sweep through the js resource
[05:26:59] <Cork> _oiseaux: well no not really it doens't return a separate function
[05:27:14] <Cork> _oiseaux: function bar() {} <-- named function
[05:27:21] <Cork> function() {} <-- anonymous function
[05:27:28] <_oiseaux> Yes
[05:27:36] <Cork> the object key is just a variable, and has nothing to do with the function reference
[05:28:01] <Cork> var a = function() {}; var b = a; b();
[05:28:28] <Cork> so bar isn't ever sent, the function reference it has is sent
[05:28:35] <_oiseaux> Don't worry, I was confused because $() wants a function, and I though that t.bar.bind(t) was a function call - but the resulting object is a copy of bar so it's all good
[05:28:54] <Cork> _oiseaux: it is a function call
[05:29:03] <Cork> to a js native function
[05:29:11] <_oiseaux> yes, sorry, bad wording
[05:29:14] <kpl> If the url is a MVC controller function taking void, can I use $.get(url,null,fnCallback) ?
[05:29:18] <Cork> and again not a copy :)
[05:29:28] <_oiseaux> the docs for bind() says copy... lemme check
[05:29:48] <Cork> _oiseaux: it sends a new reference, with the bound this
[05:29:51] <_oiseaux> Sorry, okay, bad docs
[05:29:55] <Cork> but the original function is the same
[05:30:10] <Cork> _oiseaux: it's almost the same thing but there is some differences
[05:30:57] <_oiseaux> It says "creates a new function" which I interpret as being a new anon function with this rebinded, rather than a reference to t.bar?
[05:31:04] <_oiseaux> Or I may be confused.
[05:31:33] <Cork> _oiseaux: sounds like they try to word it in a simple matter
[05:31:36] <_oiseaux> Or does $() discard the reference anyway like you said?
[05:31:42] <Cork> no
[05:31:56] <Cork> jquery doesn't know anything about what .bind does
[05:31:58] <Cork> and don't care
[05:32:27] <_oiseaux> Okay, let me start again because I'm a lil confuzzled..
[05:32:57] <_oiseaux> We call $(), with a function name (reference?) t.bar.
[05:33:17] <Cork> _oiseaux: how far into how js works do you want to go?
[05:33:28] <_oiseaux> As far as it takes to understand :)
[05:33:40] <Cork> ok, then lets take the shallow path
[05:33:59] <Cork> then t is an object reference and it has a property bar
[05:34:13] <Cork> the bar property points to a function this function is given to $()
[05:34:20] <Cork> $() knows NOTHING about t
[05:34:33] <_oiseaux> Righto.
[05:34:53] <Cork> if you do $(t.bar.bind(t)) the function reference given to $() holds a reference to t
[05:35:08] <Cork> so when $() calls the function this will be the object t points to
[05:35:42] <Cork> _oiseaux: except in older ie's when the call will error out :)
[05:35:54] <_oiseaux> Right, so $(t.bar) where t.bar = function() { return "test" } is exactly the same as $(function() { return "test" }?
[05:36:07] <Cork> yes
[05:36:17] <_oiseaux> Cool, so where I got confused is that
[05:37:32] <_oiseaux> $(t.bar.bind(t)) == $(function() { return "test" }.bind(t)). The previous example, we give an anon function, but the argument here is a function call
[05:37:45] <_oiseaux> But then, the bind() method must be evaluated before being passed, right?
[05:37:58] <Cork> yes
[05:38:00] <_oiseaux> So it returns a new function that is like the initial example, but with this rebound?
[05:38:18] <Cork> that is where it depends
[05:38:42] <Cork> the engine normally just holds the reference to the "this" for the bound reference
[05:38:56] <Cork> so it isn't a wrapping function
[05:39:10] <Cork> though yes a wrapping function is one way to do it
[05:39:18] <Cork> a bit more costly though
[05:39:20] <_oiseaux> Oh, cool, but for practical purposes it's like saying "take this anon function, but make sure this points to what I want"
[05:39:25] <Cork> yes
[05:39:31] <_oiseaux> Okay swell!
[05:39:34] <_oiseaux> Thanks!

[06:33:01] <Anticom> how do i get this working? i want to treat the value of textarea as with jquery manipulatable dom
[06:40:41] <Anticom> no one? :(
[06:40:47] <Anticom> Cork u here?^^
[06:56:05] <Anticom> since when is #jquery so silent?! :O
[06:56:23] <anthonym> since node.js was stolen by aliens.
[06:56:58] <Anticom> good point!
[06:57:27] <Anticom> however... could you take a look at my issue maybe?
[07:01:33] <Bloomberg> Hi Guys!!
[07:02:30] <jedimind> salut
[07:02:30] <atula> Anticom: I just showed up. What's the issue
[07:02:34] <atula> hi Bloomberg
[07:02:48] <Anticom> (15:32:42)<Anticom>hi all
[07:02:48] <Anticom> (15:32:43)<Anticom>http://jsfiddle.net/vbMdE/1/
[07:02:48] <Anticom> (15:33:01)<Anticom>how do i get this working? i want to treat the value of textarea as with jquery manipulatable dom
[07:02:53] <Bloomberg> how can I to do that when I click some value of that automatically coypt it to background?
[07:03:06] <Anticom> oops, also copied my greeting lol
[07:03:30] <Anticom> Bloomberg i don't get what you want to do
[07:03:39] <Anticom> clicking what? what value?! what background?!?!?!
[07:03:41] <Anticom> :O
[07:04:18] <steinarts> holy crap, we need some decryption-expert
[07:04:28] <atula> steinarts: ?
[07:04:30] <Bloomberg> For example in  a table there are several values, I need when I click the phone number automatically copy it
[07:04:32] <Anticom> atula i basically want to be able, to manipulate only that portion in #myfield inside that textarea. so i thought it might be the most reliable to treat it as dom
[07:04:41] <Bloomberg> how if I had made it copy
[07:05:00] <Anticom> Bloomberg that can't be done with native js iirc. but there's a jq plugin utilizing flash
[07:05:02] <steinarts> Bloomberg: clipboard access?
[07:05:17] <Anticom> Bloomberg http://www.steamdev.com/zclip/
[07:05:39] <t432> Cork: you there/
[07:05:40] <steinarts> atula: was trying to understand Bloombergs first question
[07:05:40] <atula> Anticom: Perhaps DOM is bad here. Maybe string replace?
[07:05:46] <atula> steinarts: ah okay
[07:05:55] <Anticom> atula there's TinyMCE sitting on top
[07:05:57] <Bloomberg> yes to clipboard!
[07:06:10] <Anticom> atula that's why i can't do some weird DSL and str_replace
[07:06:24] <atula> Anticom: ah okay. Hmmm… perhaps html fragment
[07:06:45] <Anticom> atula well i belive that this is the right terminology for what i meant ;)
[07:06:54] <atula> basically, you get the html from tincymce… load it into a partial dom… manipulate it and then put it back?
[07:07:08] <steinarts> Anticom: myfield doesnt exist. dom in textarea is interpreted as regular text
[07:07:15] <Anticom> atula no i want to manipulate the contents of #editor and then update tinymce
[07:07:19] <Anticom> that's a cleaner workflow for me
[07:07:52] <Anticom> steinarts but i can do $('<div') can't i? that's why i thought that would work with the value of that textarea too
[07:07:57] <atula> pooh… okay. then perhaps it's reversed
[07:08:01] <Anticom> '<div>'*
[07:09:21] <atula> Anticom: you want to change text in textarea -- and when certain value is change in this text area it updates the select?
[07:09:22] <Anticom> think the problem is, that i have to wrap the contents of textarea into another element... but i don't get how to do that properly: http://jsfiddle.net/vbMdE/2/
[07:09:45] <Anticom> atula no the select-change triggers an update of the textarea's text
[07:09:56] <atula> I see. okay then it's in reversed
[07:10:07] <gregf_> hi, i'm doing a var win = window.open('about:blank') to open a new window. but, win is null when using ie . it returns a window instance in ff/chrome.

[07:11:26] <Anticom> gregf_ http://lmgtfy.com/?q=ie+window.open+returns+null
[07:12:27] <gregf_> Anticom: i need protected mode to be on
[07:12:48] <Anticom> gregf_ furthermore that's not related to jquery, please ask in #javascript (and look at the 3rd result http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6948936/ie-window-open-returning-null )

[07:14:09] <Anticom> steinarts nice approach, but it's only a sample text. i don't want to replace every 7's etc. in the textarea but just that specific one
[07:14:39] <Anticom> steinarts the first occurence is right, not all
[07:14:47] <Anticom> but still i want to replace that specific one
[07:14:52] <steinarts> Anticom: yes, use templates
[07:15:08] <Anticom> steinarts nope, i won't
[07:15:14] <Anticom> brb
[07:15:51] <steinarts> Anticom: you dont want to use templates? and you want to replace a specific occurance of a value? haha, i'd like to see the regexp for that
[07:18:38] <Anticom> steinarts i know it's possible to create dom in jq and manipulate and serialize it. that's all the pieces i need. i just can't figure out how to put them together. i don't want to do a stupid regex expr

[07:22:53] <atula> line 8 us clunky and it's against my philosophy.
[07:23:59] <Anticom> atula in ff it throw's an error and doesn't work :/

[07:24:03] <atula> also. I would recommend using a class just in case you don't want to clash with id outside
[07:24:08] <atula> what error?
[07:24:13] <atula> let me load it up in FF
[07:24:44] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/vbMdE/5/ everything looks good, untill i do the .find('#myfield').text(selected)
[07:24:47] <Anticom> ._.
[07:24:47] <steinarts> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/vzP7Q/
[07:24:56] <steinarts> crude hardcore templating, but you should get the basic idea
[07:26:02] <atula> steinarts: I think Anticom is using tinyMCE so it's an editor. It would be too much to ask user to write it in a template.
[07:26:04] <Anticom> steinarts now if i edited the text in TinyMCE and changed the select, the content would pop back to it's original state
[07:26:09] <Anticom> i don't want templating...
[07:26:22] <Anticom> atula just got 100 pts
[07:26:45] <atula> oh
[07:26:47] <atula> this is outdated
[07:26:50] <atula> the one I sent you
[07:27:05] <steinarts> so... you dont know what the contents of the textarea is
[07:27:08] <Anticom> atula :D
[07:27:10] <atula> how do I share it?
[07:27:11] <steinarts> and you want to replace *something*
[07:27:16] <atula> haven't use jsfiddle in a while
[07:27:24] <steinarts> fork and copy url
[07:27:25] <steinarts> i think
[07:27:26] <steinarts> :p
[07:27:28] <Anticom> steinarts and i want to use the mighty power of DOM for that, yep
[07:27:29] <Anticom> you got it
[07:27:36] <steinarts> yeah, but like i said earlier
[07:27:44] <Anticom> well... especially the dark side of the DOM i guess ^_^
[07:27:44] <steinarts> you cannot do $('#myfield')
[07:27:46] <steinarts> it does not exist
[07:27:47] <ph88> can i access html data- attributes directly with jquery or do i have to use the attr() method ?
[07:27:48] <atula> Anticom: this was the one I sent: http://pastie.org/private/lho95bz0quwbcgf0jyryw
[07:27:51] <steinarts> there is no DOM within textarea
[07:27:58] <steinarts> its only text
[07:28:01] <atula> steinarts: he's using tinyMCE
[07:28:08] <atula> the value comes out of that text area is html
[07:28:22] <Anticom> steinarts http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model
[07:28:37] <atula> Anticom: the only thing I changed in markup is class="bottle" instead of id="myfield"
[07:29:00] <atula> Anticom: I don't know why jsfiddle share shows up differently (older version I was messing with)
[07:29:00] <Anticom> atula could you wrap this in a fiddle pls? :)
[07:29:12] <Anticom> hmm
[07:29:14] <Anticom> let me check on that
[07:29:31] <atula> http://jsfiddle.net/xsC3W/3/
[07:29:36] <atula> ash, it's "Update"
[07:29:45] <atula> I've been doing python for too long without playing with js
[07:29:51] <Anticom> atula yep
[07:30:38] <steinarts> 'doh
[07:30:47] <steinarts> my bad
[07:31:01] <steinarts> didn't understand you guys when you whipped about tinymce
[07:31:06] <Anticom> atula http://jsfiddle.net/xsC3W/4/ work's with id too
[07:31:10] <Anticom> don't know what i did wrong
[07:31:12] <Anticom> ^^
[07:31:24] <atula> I don't like id in a place that's not on the dom.
[07:31:24] <Anticom> steinarts welcome to the present! :D
[07:31:26] <steinarts> you were trying to find a #field from a textvalue
[07:31:35] <atula> I would use class but that's just me
[07:31:42] <Anticom> atula but that's the safest way for me to determine it in a prefilled editor
[07:32:05] <Anticom> atula and that's more of a semantic topic. i'm just happy right know you made it work :)
[07:32:26] <atula> well, like I said, line 8 is clunky  and it's against my philosophy
[07:32:39] <atula> but I understand, tinyMCE and rich text is a dirty business
[07:33:32] <atula> Anticom: do you see my coding style? I think it's probably preferred over the way you were coding, but it's a personal preference, I just wanted to show you how it's done by other folks.
[07:33:51] <Anticom> OH I'
[07:33:55] <Anticom> M SO STUPID
[07:33:57] <atula> ?
[07:33:59] <Anticom> ... <span id="#payment-reminder-duedate"><?= PaymentR...
[07:34:02] <Anticom> look at this markup
[07:34:04] <Anticom> .___.
[07:34:06] <Anticom> hahaha
[07:34:12] <steinarts> nice
[07:34:18] <Anticom> ba dum tssss
[07:34:53] <steinarts> atula: other folks would perhaps put the var editor= outside the event handler, but thats just finding something to complain about to make myself feel better
[07:35:00] <steinarts> :P
[07:35:13] <slax0r> Anticom: when you start making mistakes like those, take a 5 minute break, clear your mind...
[07:35:32] <slax0r> think of chicks...the furry ones or the shaved ones, whatever floats your boat
[07:35:35] <slax0r> and then return to work :P
[07:35:39] <Anticom> slax0r that won't help today i'm afraid... had an awful night and today isn't any better
[07:36:05] <Anticom> maybe i'll become a daddy today...
[07:36:33] <slax0r> ah....this changes everything then :)
[07:36:40] <Anticom> yep^^
[07:36:44] <slax0r> and congrats ;)
[07:37:28] <VadtecWk> im using .remove() on a series of inputs, and then looping over all inputs with $('input:text').each(), but the inputs that were supposedly removed are still showing up in the selection. am i missing something?
[07:37:28] <atula> steinarts: this is how I usually do mine: http://jsfiddle.net/xsC3W/6/
[07:37:38] <atula> Anticom: ^
[07:38:10] <atula> but again, everyone has their preference :)
[07:38:23] <Anticom> atula why not using backbone, angular or knockout etc.?
[07:38:28] <steinarts> this: $('<div />').html(editor.val()).... hurts my brain, and probably the browser, if its too heavy
[07:38:32] <Anticom> they play well together
[07:38:36] <atula> Anticom: oh I use that too :)
[07:38:47] <Anticom> steinarts ther's nothing heavy about this. it's elegant
[07:38:50] <atula> just wanted to show some jQuery style, that's all
[07:38:55] <Anticom> you'll get used to that steinarts
[07:39:06] <Anticom> atula which one do you prefer?
[07:39:26] <atula> I'm an old school jQuery guy, but I see angularjs being more and more popular
[07:39:41] <Anticom> i've just scratched the surface of all three of the ones i mentioned and couldn't rly decide to dive into one yet
[07:39:53] <atula> I do technology like I do fashion, a few seasons behind.
[07:40:00] <steinarts> Anticom: no, i will not get used to bloating the DOM to make a search and replace more convenient, but thats just me.
[07:40:07] <Anticom> atula well just because node.js had such a popularity boom the past month i don't start using it.
[07:40:09] <atula> it's cheaper, tested and focus on shipping product
[07:40:10] <steinarts> atula: still, you are digging up the editor every time the event is called :P
[07:40:33] <Anticom> i don't care about what's popular (most of the times, because there are of course benefits if something is popular) but i'll stick to the stuff i know and love
[07:40:47] <atula> steinarts: I was thinking that the editor is loaded into dom dynamically too
[07:41:01] <atula> but ehhh.. not 100% sure about that. you are correct though
[07:41:16] <atula> Anticom: well, don't be too comfortable
[07:41:22] <Anticom> steinarts but that's what you gonna see independently of my recent issue. that's just how jquery was designed. chaining was and is one of the major principles in jq
[07:41:44] <steinarts> Anticom: you dont understand what im trying to say, but no matter. your stuff is working as intended
[07:42:18] <Quest> can anyone please visit http://122.129.80.210:8084/ttmaven/login   with admin@admin.com:admin then   http://122.129.80.210:8084/ttmaven/boards/3     . The white drop down arrow when pressed shows up a form to create a box. it makes an ajax call, creates box in database and as well in the dom. then the black arrow of the newly created box dont work. what is wrong ?
[07:42:31] <Anticom> atula well it's basically a data binding. tinymce adds some dom and listens on the textarea to update it's canvas. and the other way around of course so that you can submit your form the known way
[07:43:22] <atula> Anticom: I would recommend pub/sub with custom event too if you want to be a bit fancier
[07:43:26] <atula> but that's another topic
[07:44:13] <steinarts> i'd love to see what happens when something in the tinymce has the same id as something already in the dom tho :P
[07:44:29] <steinarts> so, i agree with atula on avoiding id's
[07:44:31] <Anticom> atula my development style (unfortunately) is driven by results. i have to deliver products in the shortest amount of time. furthtermore it's not js-centric but mostly server-side logic
[07:44:39] <Anticom> that's why i want to keep my js simple ;)
[07:45:27] <Anticom> steinarts that's commonly avoided by using the pattern 'vendor's-id-text'+[index / id of element]
[07:45:42] <Anticom> so you'd have id="tinymce-1" instead of id="tinymce"
[07:45:47] <atula> Anticom: I understand. You could do both. Deliver good stuff with good style
[07:45:53] <atula> it takes a lot of practice :)
[07:46:00] <Anticom> atula that's what i'm trying to do :P
[07:46:06] <atula> good.
[07:46:17] <TeddyMurray> hi, i have a function declared like this: Utility.Form.post = function ( sUrl, sForm, fCallback ) and within that i have $.post(sUrl, $(sForm).serialize(), fCallback); after some processing. How can i add another line of code to the fCallback?
[07:46:39] <slax0r> I use IDs everywhere I can, if it's an element appearing only once in current response, it's has an ID
[07:47:00] <Anticom> TeddyMurray what do you mean by "adding" another line
[07:47:09] <Anticom> you could deliver a callback at the end of your callback
[07:47:16] <Anticom> and feed that with logic from outside
[07:47:24] <[deedee]> hm the interactive console in http://try.jquery.com/ is pretty cool - remembers me to ipython & co - is there an ide supporting a console for jquery?
[07:47:32] <TeddyMurray> let me think on that for a moment Anticom
[07:47:47] <Anticom> TeddyMurray please wait, thinking in progress...
[07:47:52] <TeddyMurray> lol
[07:48:25] <TeddyMurray> let me post the whole code on a pastebin
[07:48:27] <TeddyMurray> one moment
[07:48:30] <TeddyMurray> ... pasting...
[07:48:39] <Anticom> TeddyMurray pls use jsfiddle.net
[07:48:42] <Anticom> so it's interactive
[07:48:46] <TeddyMurray> kk
[07:48:48] <Anticom> or jsbin or whatever you prefer
[07:49:14] <atula> steinarts, Anticom: last doodle before I get back to work: http://jsfiddle.net/xsC3W/7/
[07:49:20] <VadtecWk> does anyone have any info on my question from above?
[07:49:53] <Anticom> VadtecWk what was ur question again? sorry :/
[07:50:01] <VadtecWk> im using .remove() on a series of inputs, and then looping over all inputs with $('input:text').each(), but the inputs that were supposedly removed are still showing up in the selection. am i missing something?
[07:50:44] <steinarts> Anticom: Yeah, that's cute. But you are duping the DOM when you do $('<div/>').html(editor.val())
[07:50:49] <Anticom> VadtecWk did you take a look at $('input:text') on your console?
[07:51:01] <Anticom> wether they were realy removed?
[07:51:25] <VadtecWk> Anticom, yes, i have checked the console, but they are showing up there as well, hence why im O.o
[07:51:26] <Anticom> steinarts what am i doing? sorry don't know what you mean by "duping"
[07:51:27] <bamj0rb> I'm attempting to interrupt a radio button being selected to prompt the user for confirmation.
[07:51:57] <bamj0rb> The browser API surrounding radio buttons seems to be terribly lacking robustness.
[07:52:03] <Anticom> VadtecWk how are those input's placed in the DOM? maybe there's some kind of listener that kicks in and re-creates the inputs
[07:52:39] <Anticom> bamj0rb use e.preventDefault(), then create a jq-ui dialog and if the user clicks OK select it
[07:52:52] <VadtecWk> Anticom, in this case, they are loaded via an ajax call on the fly, but i dont see any event listeners attached to them after they are loaded
[07:52:52] <steinarts> aha, bastards are using an iframe
[07:52:56] <steinarts> no matter, scratch all i said
[07:53:19] <steinarts> why dont you access the dom of that iframe directly tho.... hmm... oh well
[07:53:31] <bamj0rb> Anticom: That was what I obviously tried first. :P The change event fires after the value is changed so there's nothing to prevent. :(
[07:54:02] <Anticom> steinarts nevertheless i think you're missing that i'm not appending the temporary dom to the document. it's just an isolated piece of objects following a convention and because of that are able to be manipulated by the browser's js engine
[07:54:38] <Anticom> bamj0rb are you sure? the e.preventDefault() MUST be the first statement in your callback
[07:54:57] <Anticom> i'm not sure wether it's true what you've said but it sound's strange to me
[07:55:15] <VadtecWk> Anticom, as far as .remove() removing them from the DOM, it does work from a visual stance, and when I view the active HTML source they are removed, but its almost as if they are still held in the DOM somehow
[07:55:17] <Anticom> atula btw very elegant approach in your last fiddle
[07:55:51] <bamj0rb> Anticom: I'm not sure. Perhaps I need to bind the callback on all the radios in the group, not just the special case...
[07:55:51] <Anticom> VadtecWk don't inspect it visually. do a console.log($('input:text')); after your .remove() statement
[07:56:05] <Anticom> and look at them in a debugging tool like firebug or the other build in's
[07:56:12] <VadtecWk> Anticom, i have, thats why im here, beacuse they are still showing up
[07:56:23] <VadtecWk> im using chrome, so im using the built in debugger
[07:56:29] <VadtecWk> which is also how ive been testing this
[07:56:32] <bamj0rb> jQuery should really add an API to manage a radio group as a single entity. That would be nice.
[07:56:37] <Anticom> bamj0rb well then it would be the .select event, not the .change event, wouldn't it?
[07:56:58] <bamj0rb> Anticom: I didn't even know there was a select event... o_O I would guess that is for text selection though.
[07:58:14] <Anticom> bamj0rb forget what i just said... the .select event covers something else
[07:58:21] <steinarts> lol, irssi autoignored entire #jquery channel after my last statement
[07:58:25] <Anticom> bamj0rb if you provide a fiddle, i'll take a look at it
[07:58:33] <steinarts> or... rather... i failed at ignoring just joins/quits
[08:01:35] <VadtecWk> Anticom, so, i think is what it is, i was actually removing the div around the inputs, not the inputs themselves, go figure
[08:01:48] <jim87> hello! I'd like to know if it's possible to select all the elements that have "data-toPage" attribute. Any hint? I tried with $(":data(toPage)"), but I think it's only for jQueryUI
[08:03:58] <jim87> Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: data
[08:07:14] <VadtecWk> Anticom, correct me if im wrong, but isnt .remove() supposed to remove all child nodes of the node being removed?
[08:08:00] <VadtecWk> Anticom, http://api.jquery.com/remove/ <--- thats how i read it anyways
[08:08:20] <[deedee]> i have a newbie question about the select logic of jquery (just doing the tutorial) - why is that? (question in first comment line): http://pastebin.com/rWTjS0RX
[08:11:43] <[deedee]> why does  $(".asia,.europe sale") NOT select the css class "europe sale" but $(".asia. sale) " does the job?
[08:12:28] <[deedee]> ups $(".asia, .sale") i meant
[08:13:32] <lasha> because the comma separate means "AND"
[08:14:08] <lasha> ".asia.sale" without the space means single element with both of those classes
[08:14:11] <[deedee]> lasha: no thats not the question - i want to select 2 classes, but the name of the 2nd class is "europe sale"
[08:14:29] <lasha> "europe sale"
[08:14:31] <lasha> that's two classes...
[08:14:39] <[deedee]> oha
[08:14:45] <lasha> you need a dash
[08:14:49] <lasha> or camelcase them
[08:15:03] <lasha> css ids and classes can't have spaces between them
[08:15:26] <[deedee]> lasha: than the tutorial @ try.jquery.com sucks ;O
[08:15:42] <[deedee]> let me make a screeny
[08:15:46] <bamj0rb> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/xcE9L/
[08:17:29] <bamj0rb> jim87: jQuery("*[data-toPage]")
[08:17:39] <[deedee]> lasha: look at that: http://i.imgur.com/QmiqhHX.jpg?1
[08:18:23] <jennmoneydollars> [deedee] your example has ".europe sale" instead of ".europe.sale"
[08:18:25] <[deedee]> the li calss name is "europe sale" and not "sale" - but only $(sale) selects the class "europe sale" - confusing
[08:18:42] <lasha> i see how it's confusing
[08:19:11] <jim87> thanks bamj0rb... is :data("myData") available only when I set data via $(myselector).data("myData", "my data")?
[08:19:42] <bamj0rb> jim87: I've honestly never seen :data before. :-/
[08:19:57] <jim87> bamj0rb: http://api.jqueryui.com/data-selector/
[08:20:47] <bamj0rb> jim87: OK, yes, sounds like that will only match if you have stored data with the jQuery.data() method.
[08:21:06] <bamj0rb> jim87: Also, that's jQueryUI, not jQuery, but semantics...
[08:21:27] <jim87> yep bamj0rb, I wrongly assumed selectors where jQuery's
[08:21:40] <jim87> were*
[08:27:47] <t432> line 15 is not firing http://pastebin.com/viMSWZc6
[08:28:16] <t432> should print word out in console, which it is not doing.
[08:28:24] <Anticom> sorry guys, our sys admin went in and i had a chat with him
[08:28:41] <rabbite> I'm trying to append the input_group to the header, then place the span as the first child of input_group and the input as the second child
[08:28:42] <rabbite> http://jsfiddle.net/8pzNg/
[08:28:56] <rabbite> Not sure what I'm missing here.
[08:29:13] <slick-> guys how do i replace every instance of a URL on a page
[08:29:14] <slick-> with another
[08:29:19] <Anticom> bamj0rb well as i said, the e.preventDefault() MUST be the first statement in the callback, otherwise the event will bubble
[08:29:23] <slick-> i tried
[08:29:23] <slick-> $("a[href='http://wkgirls.com/wolfgang-kals-exhibition-arta-gallery/']").attr('href', 'http://www.live.com/');
[08:29:50] <rabbite> slick-: make a loop, for each <a> that matches, replace with new <a>
[08:29:55] <bamj0rb> Anticom: Doesn't matter. If you block inside the event you'll see that the selected radio has already changed.
[08:30:08] <slick-> but that doesn't work for one link
[08:30:59] <bamj0rb> Anticom: Also, I don't think it matters where in a callback you call preventDefault().
[08:32:26] <iwuehfiwuef> Hi - does anyone know of a touch library that can distinguish between multiple hands/users?
[08:33:02] <slick-> uhh
[08:33:07] <slick-> can someone please help
[08:33:11] <slick-> need to replace a url with another
[08:33:14] <slick-> on a page
[08:33:38] <rabbite> slick-: what have you tried so far? You've only given very vague descriptions
[08:33:48] <slick-> i tried this: $("a[href='http://wkgirls.com/wolfgang-kals-exhibition-arta-gallery/']").attr('href', 'http://www.live.com/');
[08:33:50] <slick-> it didn't work
[08:33:50] <rabbite> Show code, be patient.
[08:34:15] <rabbite> You're linking to a broken page?
[08:34:19] <slick-> oh never mind haha
[08:34:25] <slick-> sorry i didn thane it inside query ready
[08:34:25] <slick-> sorry
[08:34:46] <slick-> i love you guys
[08:34:47] <slick-> it worked
[08:36:41] <Anticom> bamj0rb http://jsfiddle.net/xcE9L/4/ lol somehow the alert won't work :/
[08:36:49] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/dbzrh9hjrnootlhthhodnq - when entering product-box-content the hover class fades in, the hover class is bigger, so I want it to fade out when it leaves, so far so good
[08:36:50] <Anticom> but in essence it seems to work now
[08:37:23] <nisseni> however, there are more divs within the content-class, which makes the hover class fadeout and in instantly, quite disturbing, anyone with a good solution to this?
[08:37:47] <nisseni> like "don't fade out if children within product-box-content is entered
[08:39:02] <iwuehfiwuef> Hi - does anyone know of a touch library that can distinguish between multiple hands/users?
[08:40:11] <lasha> for web?
[08:40:14] <lasha> probably not possible.....
[08:40:50] <rabbite> iwuehfiwuef: the only thing i've ever seen in that regard is kivy.com
[08:40:56] <rabbite> er
[08:41:02] <RRR2> hands?
[08:41:12] <rabbite> http://kivy.org/#home
[08:41:26] <bamj0rb> Anticom: I ... I can't even figure out how that is working the way it is... O_O
[08:43:52] <bamj0rb> Anticom: The else branch is always executing though. Presumably because any time that event fires the element is getting checked.
[08:44:07] <Anticom> i know, the if statement is crap there^^
[08:44:11] <bamj0rb> Anticom: What's confusing me is that even though you're explicitly setting it checked, it is getting unchecked.. It's almost like it toggles off again..
[08:44:16] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/xcE9L/9/ this is my current version
[08:44:27] <Anticom> i just don't get the radiobutton checked, if the user confirms ur dialog
[08:44:49] <Anticom> i'm using a little workaround with html5 data, to mark it as checked
[08:45:15] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/dbzrh9hjrnootlhthhodnq - I get flickering when entering divs inside product-box-content - anyone know about this?
[08:45:37] <bamj0rb> Anticom: s/intput/input/
[08:45:52] <slick-> i needs me some good coffee guys
[08:46:14] <Anticom> bamj0rb i got it now i think^^
[08:46:48] <iwuehfiwuef> rabbite: so nothing browser based?
[08:47:18] <Anticom> bamj0rb  http://jsfiddle.net/xcE9L/11/ comment either line 14 or 17 to see the changes
[08:47:23] <Anticom> there's no e.preventDefault() needed
[08:47:35] <Anticom> you can just set the elements properties depending on what happened
[08:48:17] <rabbite> iwuehfiwuef: It's not really clear what you are looking for. A multi-touch jQuery library?
[08:48:30] <bamj0rb> Anticom: You are on to something. I have it working in Chrome. Unfortunately, IE8 behaves differently and unchecks the original first...
[08:48:47] <zizzl> Hey guys, I'm earlier versions of IE my website wont load, getting "... is not responding due to a long-running script." Where do I start to troubleshoot?
[08:49:31] <mvpgraff> Can you disable the current date in datepicker?
[08:49:31] <rabbite> zizzl: I usually put console.log statements in various places to see where the hangups are.
[08:49:36] <tetradon> I'm running into an issue I need help troubleshooting
[08:49:56] <Anticom> bamj0rb final solution:  http://jsfiddle.net/xcE9L/13/
[08:50:07] <iwuehfiwuef> rabbite: Essentially yes (not necessarily jQuery), though it needs to be able to differentiate between different hands / users as it will be used on a large touchscreen display in a shopping center
[08:50:24] <Anticom> after the "Two" has been checked the dialog won't pop up again... that's what all the .data() stuff is about
[08:50:37] <Anticom> core logic is lines 8 to 15
[08:51:41] <Anticom> bamj0rb http://code.jquery.com/ what jq-version are you using? (*hint* : "jQuery 2.x (IE <9 not supported)")
[08:51:53] <rabbite> iwuehfiwuef: As far as I know, without building some custom hardware/software mix, there is no way a touch interface can distinguish between different users.
[08:51:59] <tetradon> So, if I do something like: var $form = $("#myForm")...and then later I run $form.submit() and it fails but $form[0].submit() succeeds, what are a few things that I could be doing wrong?
[08:52:05] <Anticom> if it still doesn't work with .data() just create an input[type=hidden] and set it's value to 1 / 0
[08:52:21] <iwuehfiwuef> rabbite: was afraid of that - thanks for clarifying
[08:52:23] <cnap_> Hey people
[08:52:34] <rabbite> iwuehfiwuef: That sort of thing is theoretically possible with kivy, but again, you'd need some sort of computer vision application to tell user A from user B
[08:53:00] <cnap_> I wanna do something similar to this: http://prntscr.com/1wg0c2 ... So I need something a drop down menu or a slider moving downwards in order to display some albums. Any suggestions ?
[08:53:05] <bamj0rb> Anticom: 1.9.1. :(
[08:53:18] <tetradon> Our there just two things: I'm trying to get the DOM element with the selector before it exists or I'm getting back an array of forms with that id (something I'd need to fix)?
[08:54:04] <tetradon> This is a theoretical question because I'm doing a code review and can't test the code readily myself
[08:55:18] <Anticom> bamj0rb did you try my latest fiddle? (rev 13 iirc)
[08:56:00] <bamj0rb> Anticom: Yes. The problem is that IE behaves differently.
[08:56:26] <bamj0rb> Anticom: When you cancel the event in IE, it prevents the current radio from being checked, but it still unchecks the old one. Otherwise, I have it working fine.
[08:56:38] <bamj0rb> Anticom: I think I'm going to have to try to remember the last value and restore that ...
[08:57:05] <Anticom> i'm not canceling any event anymore
[08:57:24] <Anticom> bamj0rb oh i see what you mean
[08:57:48] <Anticom> bamj0rb that's not an IE specific problem
[08:58:22] <bamj0rb> Anticom: Regardless of how you do it, the previous box gets unchecked. :)
[08:58:40] <jax> hi, is there a better way to get data streaming in from a server instead of polling every second?
[08:58:51] <jax> i'm runningl like 3 get requests per second to update the ui
[08:58:56] <jax> (sensor data)
[08:59:05] <jedimind> websockets
[08:59:31] <koleS320> Does anyone have experience with jQuery-file-upload + Angular.js ?
[08:59:55] <timcess_> If i change value of <input type="hidden" like this: $("#indicator").val("1") I still see old value in the source code of web page, though alert($("#indicator").val()) show me new value. Is it possibly to change it?
[09:00:13] <jax> thanks jedimind
[09:00:25] <LoneSoldier728> hey can people take a look at this before I put it out for opensource as a scraper
[09:00:26] <LoneSoldier728> https://gist.github.com/lgavra/6920813
[09:00:33] <LoneSoldier728> tell me if there is anything wrong with it
[09:00:35] <Anticom> bamj0rb it's gotta be something like that: http://jsfiddle.net/xcE9L/14/ but i can't finish it
[09:00:55] <Anticom> it's home time for me now
[09:01:00] <Anticom> bb
[09:02:42] <bamj0rb> Anticom: Thanks for your help. Later.
[09:03:28] <DelphiWorld> hello jqueryist
[09:03:32] <DelphiWorld> question
[09:03:35] <DelphiWorld> if i have a nav bar
[09:03:53] <DelphiWorld> i want to load links from navbars, but want the "content" div to be the target, is that pocible?
[09:05:09] <jedimind> yup
[09:05:44] <DelphiWorld> jedimind: how please?
[09:05:50] <jedimind> using jquery
[09:05:54] <DelphiWorld> jedimind: i am blind, trying to learn:)
[09:05:57] <jedimind> so go learn
[09:06:01] <jedimind> instead of asking for someone to do it for you
[09:06:10] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/dbzrh9hjrnootlhthhodnq - I get flickering when entering divs inside product-box-content - anyone know about this?
[09:06:20] <jedimind> its really simple, just need to know basic jquery / dom manipulation
[09:06:33] <DelphiWorld> jedimind: i asked here cause i didnt find a solution, most people using iframes
[09:06:43] <jedimind> did you try ... google?
[09:06:50] <DelphiWorld> jedimind: dayly
[09:06:52] <DelphiWorld> but ourly
[09:07:03] <DelphiWorld> and... web browsing with tts...
[09:07:46] <jedimind> weird
[09:07:57] <jedimind> i used google and came up with thousands of results
[09:07:59] <jedimind> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/how-to-create-a-slick-tabbed-content-area/
[09:08:07] <jedimind> like that for example that basically walks you through it step by step
[09:08:43] <DelphiWorld> jedimind: i hope css dont piss me off, css is not my friend... my eyes dont evean see light:)
[09:09:07] <nisseni> can people see what I write?
[09:09:15] <jedimind> yes, but DelphiWorld might not be able to
[09:09:19] <jedimind> @ nisseni
[09:09:34] <DelphiWorld> nisseni: we see
[09:09:44] <nisseni> just making sure, no response ;)
[09:09:45] <DelphiWorld> jedimind: lol i dont realy see but i heare
[09:10:00] <nisseni> sometimes there are some login issues on freenode
[09:10:05] <jedimind> we dont see any flickering nisseni
[09:10:10] <jedimind> because its not a real testcase
[09:10:28] <DelphiWorld> nisseni: i have login issue only if i use he.net ipv6
[09:15:28] <nisseni> jedimind: not sure how to make a test case when using php-code
[09:15:55] <jedimind> copy the html in question from view source?
[09:16:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If you load a json file with ajax and the file is empty, will it be a success callback or failure?
[09:18:05] <nisseni> jedimind: not that simple, developing locally, with local images
[09:18:58] <nisseni> jedimind: and the one online takes a login, which I won't give out :)
[09:21:12] <nisseni> jedimind: http://jsfiddle.net/Tp7YC/ - kinda messy, but you get the point
[09:21:31] <nisseni> jedimind: try hovering over the text, then hover out and in over the text (enter a new element)
[09:21:42] <DelphiWorld> back
[09:24:10] <plambwk> hey jedimind how much would you like to help me with a jquery question right now
[09:25:16] <DelphiWorld> thank for your help jedimind
[09:29:18] <koleS320> I include <script src="/static/jQuery-File-Upload-8.8.7/js/main.js"></script> in html and in browser I end up with : GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/[object%20Object] 404 (NOT FOUND)
[09:29:21] <koleS320> any ideas why?
[09:30:33] <threesixes> ive only done a touch of jquery...  sliding nav menus  i like the idea of nav being completely hidden away into the sites avatar @ top left of the page
[09:31:23] <ryorky1> I'm trying to create a regex that will match when a specific word is found anywhere in a string:  here is what I have so far: ^(.*?(\FullUrl\b)[^$]*|[^$]*)$
[09:31:38] <ryorky1> any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
[09:35:13] <nisseni> jedimind: hope it's somewhat understandable :)
[09:37:15] <duch_kazatel> ryorky1 you're trying to find a word no matter where it is in the string?
[09:37:22] <duch_kazatel> does case matter?
[09:37:31] <duch_kazatel> and why a regex?
[09:37:45] <duch_kazatel> and what's the word you're trying to make?
[09:37:47] <duch_kazatel> *match
[09:38:15] <shop_keeper> If its just a word, the regex is just /word/
[09:38:40] <duch_kazatel> if you're just testing for the existence of a word, use .indexOf() instead
[09:39:03] <duch_kazatel> if you need a regex, just use what shop_keeper noted.
[09:40:55] <Nephro> Can anyone tell me how can I get the value of the selection option of a select element in jquery? Googling screws me up a bit due to select selected word play
[09:41:20] <duch_kazatel> Nephro you mean the value of a select in a form?
[09:41:20] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  the .on should not be inside the .ajax. but only declared once. no matter how many times new elements are created
[09:41:34] <duch_kazatel> $('select').val() iirc
[09:41:36] <duch_kazatel> Quest huh?
[09:41:45] <duch_kazatel> oh you're that dude from yesterday.
[09:41:47] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[09:41:49] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  yes
[09:42:04] <duch_kazatel> wait were you attaching the event listeners inside the ajax call?
[09:42:13] <duch_kazatel> because i tried to tell you multiple times to not do that.
[09:42:19] <duch_kazatel> attach it once.
[09:45:15] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  heres to correct code that should work     with the    .on()     in you private message
[09:45:15] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  yes. thats what you told me yesterday
[09:45:15] <Quest> this code  seem ok. besides the newly created black arrow dropdown menu is just text and not css styled
[09:45:16] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  just though I should point it to you . Thanks again for helping me and givng me time yesterday :)
[09:45:25] <duch_kazatel> dude what the hell?
[09:45:28] <duch_kazatel> i'm not going to help you.
[09:45:53] <duch_kazatel> don't PM me please.

[09:46:36] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: LOL, you remembered me my first day on irc:)
[09:46:39] <Quest> duch_kazatel,  i didnt asked for help. i just pointed out the mistake. thought you might wanted to learn/ know too
[09:47:04] <duch_kazatel> Quest I was the one that told you the solution.  why in the hell would i need to "lean/ know"?
[09:47:09] <duch_kazatel> i all ready knew.
[09:47:12] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: thank realy you let me at least laugh a litle:)
[09:47:20] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld hrm?
[09:47:27] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: pm
[09:48:02] <duch_kazatel> oh hahaha

[09:48:45] <DelphiWorld> http://dpaste.com/1412304/
[09:48:45] <duch_kazatel> Quest I told you repeatedly to read about events to solve your problem.
[09:48:52] <DelphiWorld> am i missclosing a header here?
[09:48:59] <DelphiWorld> tabs are not switching, mmmmmmmmmmmmm
[09:49:57] <shop_keeper> I show a type error, but your code doesn't seem to work for me at all....
[09:50:10] <shop_keeper> uncaught type error on line 32
[09:50:15] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld you'll get more help if you make a jsfiddle.
[09:50:28] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: what is jsfiddle?
[09:50:36] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:50:40] <duch_kazatel> learn how to properly use this.
[09:50:51] <duch_kazatel> lets others run your code in browser.
[09:50:53] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: thank, i will
[09:50:58] <shop_keeper> Also, if you don't already use the javascript console of the browser.
[09:51:04] <DelphiWorld> shop_keeper: yes, cause maybe i'm using a plugin?
[09:51:14] <shop_keeper> Must be it...
[09:52:30] <DelphiWorld> trying jssfidle
[09:55:15] <DelphiWorld> oh, very complicated
[09:55:26] <DelphiWorld> accessibility on http://jsfiddle.net is null
[09:55:32] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:55:42] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel:  i am blind
[09:55:48] <duch_kazatel> Oh.
[09:55:49] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: screen readability is zero on http://jsfiddle.net/
[09:55:49] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[09:56:03] <duch_kazatel> DelphiWorld i'm sorry!  I didn't know.
[09:56:10] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: np
[09:56:15] <duch_kazatel> also: right on to you for still coding.
[09:56:20] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: n normal:)
[09:56:22] <duch_kazatel> that's imrpressive.
[09:57:52] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: wanna run my code directly from my url?
[09:58:59] <duch_kazatel> Delphiworld i actually need to do some stuff at work - sorry!
[09:59:13] <DelphiWorld> duch_kazatel: N|P :-P
[09:59:24] <DelphiWorld> can someone help  Please?
[10:10:55] <gregf_> hi, this is a javascript question :/ but i needed some help :)
[10:11:08] <duch_kazatel> okay
[10:11:21] <duch_kazatel> very existential.
[10:12:24] <gregf_> i'm creating some html content from the server as html: its like <form><input type="hidden" name="a" value="100"></form><script>document.forms[0].action = "myaction"; document.forms[0].submit; </script>
[10:12:42] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle it.
[10:12:55] <gregf_> ok
[10:16:09] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: well jsfiddle does not accept html tags :/
[10:16:18] <gregf_> let me post it as one line to here :/
[10:16:22] <duch_kazatel> gregf_ yes it does.
[10:16:32] <duch_kazatel> you just need to post the snippet.
[10:16:37] <duch_kazatel> you don't need the root html node.
[10:17:00] <gregf_> i get an error: Input plain JavaScript code, no HTM
[10:17:04] <DelphiWorld> guys please anyone can help me debug?
[10:17:14] <duch_kazatel> gregf_ right - put your HTML in one pane.
[10:17:18] <duch_kazatel> and your js in another.
[10:17:22] <duch_kazatel> you do see the labels, right?
[10:17:31] <gregf_> well the js needs the html :)
[10:17:43] <duch_kazatel> gregf_ huh?
[10:17:46] <gregf_> its an html string i get from the server
[10:17:50] <duch_kazatel> you can put them in two separate places.
[10:17:55] <gregf_> ok let me
[10:17:56] <duch_kazatel> oh it's a string from the server.
[10:19:08] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/2zC6D/1/
[10:19:13] <gregf_> yeah
[10:19:41] <duch_kazatel> that's scary, but ok.
[10:19:44] <duch_kazatel> so what's the issue?
[10:19:56] <gregf_> i can view the source and i can see the form with all the hidden fields, but the javascript in the <script> does not post the form
[10:20:12] <gregf_> if i include a submit button in there and click it, it submits the form :/
[10:20:43] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: should the script code get executed after the form has rendered?
[10:20:44] <duch_kazatel> do you see any errors when you try to submit the other way?
[10:20:55] <gregf_> as in using a submit button?
[10:21:07] <duch_kazatel> "i can view the source and i can see the form with all the hidden fields, but the javascript in the <script> does not post the form"
[10:21:19] <duch_kazatel> do you mean you're trying to submit the form via js?
[10:21:25] <gregf_> yep
[10:21:57] <duch_kazatel> document.forms[0].submit should be document.forms[0].submit()
[10:22:08] <duch_kazatel> submit is a method.
[10:22:27] <gregf_> i open a new window, i add a html string(which is a form with hidden fields and a script tag), and i was expecting the script code execute :/
[10:22:37] <gregf_> ah wait, let me check
[10:24:13] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: well it has the parentheses :/
[10:24:26] <gregf_> that was a typo as i'd typed it on the fly :/
[10:24:40] <duch_kazatel> so you're creating a popup window with a form and trying to submit it.
[10:24:51] <gregf_> bingo
[10:24:51] <duch_kazatel> why?
[10:25:05] <gregf_> cuz i needs to be submitted that way :/
[10:25:28] <gregf_> its a cross domain request but it works if i include a submit button
[10:25:32] <gregf_> s/i/it/
[10:26:06] <gregf_> duch_kazatel: i dont need to bother about what happens when the form is posted
[10:26:44] <gregf_> i can submit the form if i include a submit button and it does get rendered
[10:26:44] <duch_kazatel> i wonder if the browser is stopping you from autosubmitting.
[10:27:19] <duch_kazatel> also: window.open doesn't make popups.
[10:27:25] <gregf_> well, if i copy the form and hidden fields with the script tags to a .html file and open it in chrome it loads the form
[10:27:39] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to create a popup and autosubmit that.
[10:27:39] <gregf_> well, its a new window :/
[10:27:54] <gregf_> exactly
[10:28:09] <gregf_> the autosubmit is done by the script tags
[10:28:22] <gregf_> it works standalone
[10:28:40] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7430590/how-to-autosubmit-a-form-in-javascript
[10:28:43] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[10:29:09] <gregf_> well, i've read like 50 stackoverflow links but it does not work for me :/
[10:29:39] <duch_kazatel> dude...
[10:30:04] <gregf_> oh wait
[10:30:17] <duch_kazatel> you're not making a valid form.  your code is funky.  your action isn't valid.
[10:30:17] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[10:30:23] <duch_kazatel> make a valid form.
[10:35:16] <gregf_> ok
[10:40:23] <gregf_> duch_kazatel:thanks!
[11:06:21] <mike9292> {"notes":"Lorem ipsum ipso facto hf hdfh dfh dfh dfh ","syl_croc":true}

[11:32:55] <LoneSoldier728> my attempt /\.com/
[11:33:05] <LoneSoldier728> sorry containts .com
[11:33:08] <LoneSoldier728> contains
[11:33:26] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: /.com/
[11:34:52] <LoneSoldier728> how do u specify contains tho
[11:34:59] <LoneSoldier728> doesnt matter if something is before or after it
[11:35:36] <LoneSoldier728> iejwfi9 .com djs3
[11:35:39] <LoneSoldier728> i.e
[11:35:45] <jphase> regex is recursive by default ;)
[11:36:27] <LoneSoldier728> hm i tried /.com/ does not work still leaves the fb.com
[11:36:35] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: http://regexpal.com/
[11:36:43] <jphase> oh wait
[11:36:53] <jphase> you need to match the whole string? like the stuff before and after too or just the .com's ?
[11:37:23] <LoneSoldier728> i want to basically
[11:37:35] <LoneSoldier728> say if .com is in the string
[11:37:37] <LoneSoldier728> to remove the whole string
[11:37:51] <LoneSoldier728> i have match working, i just need to specify what it is matching
[11:37:53] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: well... try something like (.*).com(.*) then
[11:38:09] <jphase> (.*) = anything at any length yadda yadda
[11:38:25] <jphase> that's a REALLY open ended regex match though
[11:38:41] <LoneSoldier728> do i need to slash the parenthesis out tho
[11:38:50] <LoneSoldier728> because it is being put into a key value
[11:38:56] <LoneSoldier728> like in the value part
[11:39:29] <jphase> always wrap in / /
[11:40:06] <LoneSoldier728> so that /(.*).com(.*)/
[11:40:07] <LoneSoldier728> ?
[11:40:12] <LoneSoldier728> because that doesnt work
[11:41:00] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: use that link I gave you earlier... if you have Mac download "Reggy" or another app that will allow you to test your regex matches
[11:41:07] <LoneSoldier728> ya
[11:41:16] <LoneSoldier728> im trying to use it how can u tell if it matches
[11:41:31] <jphase> LoneSoldier728: that site, you put the regex in the box on top, the string in the box on bottom
[11:41:33] <LoneSoldier728> ah kk
[11:41:34] <jphase> it will highlight your match
[11:41:37] <LoneSoldier728> no slashes needed
[11:41:42] <jphase> well
[11:41:44] <jphase> slashes are in JS
[11:41:55] <jphase> the regex string itself doesn't need them
[11:41:59] <LoneSoldier728> ok so it seems to work in this example hm
[11:42:48] <zizzl> Hey guys my website is loading fine in every browser but in ie8 and below I get ..."is not responding due to a long-running script." Once I click "Stop Script" all I see are the backgrounds for all the sections of the website and nothing else. It's quite frustrating and I feel like I've tried everything
[11:44:21] <cnap_> I wanna do something similar to this: http://prntscr.com/1wg0c2 ... So I need something a drop down menu or a slider moving downwards in order to display some albums. Any suggestions ?
[11:44:43] <LoneSoldier728> it works thanks
[11:44:59] <fons1> Equal column height script not working in Chrome and Safari but works fine in IE and Firefox. It doubles the div height on each resize. The script targets anything with the class "eqcolumn" that is inside a container with the class "content".

[11:55:32] <fons1> Site here: http://test.modernhometours.com/about-us/
[11:55:59] <jedimind> that is quite the css there
[11:56:34] <jedimind> ps you dont need javascript for equal height columns
[11:57:34] <fons1> I can't use faux columns due to the fact I have a border to the right of each column.
[11:58:19] <fons1> I also have dynamic content which complicates things a bit
[11:58:30] <jedimind> none of those are an issue
[11:58:50] <jedimind> faux columns isnt exactly the way to do equal height columns any more considering its a 10+ year old technique
[11:59:00] <fons1> How would you go about it?
[11:59:08] <jedimind> easy way with modern browsers: http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/
[11:59:23] <jedimind> http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/equal-height-columns-cross-browser-css-no-hacks
[11:59:32] <jedimind> slightly more complex method with greater browser support
[11:59:56] <jedimind> and another one http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/onetruelayout/equalheight
[12:00:20] <fons1> I need it to work with older browsers so Flexbox isn't a solution i'd like to use.
[12:01:20] <fons1> I've also tried that second solution you've posted but it broke my layout.
[12:01:53] <fons1> I believe it extended past my footer div.
[12:02:24] <jedimind> thats an easy fix
[12:02:27] <jedimind> but okay
[12:02:30] <fons1> If I can just get the script I posted to work that would be awesome.
[12:03:23] <jedimind> its far from awesome, youre leveraging cpu power and bogging down the site just so you can acheive a trivial visual thing
[12:03:25] <jedimind> but i digress
[12:03:36] <fons1> It went past my footer and I believe the border on the columns weren't displaying correctly.
[12:03:37] <jedimind> i dont actually know whats wrong w/ your fiddle its too convoluted

[12:23:10] <Fishrock123> Funny enough, alert(1); works if i put it in. console.log doesn't fire or anything.
[12:23:57] <Zzaichik> http://jsfiddle.net/SFM87/
[12:24:20] <Zzaichik> seems to work for me

[12:30:06] <Zzaichik> der, my bad - wasn't even looking at that. I was focusing on the mouseenter.
[12:41:23] <crankhar1er> .toggle() and .load() are listed on the 1.8 deprecation page, but they are both still in the current API.  did they change? where do I get that info?
[12:41:26] <crankhar1er> http://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/deprecated-1.8/
[12:44:55] <Criten> crankhar1er, there is nothing on the $.fn.toggle page that says it's depricated though...
[12:45:09] <Criten> deprecated*
[12:46:05] <Criten> Oh... the toggle event was
[12:49:54] <nhulea> hey I am having a hard time with this it http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/Lur5f/
[12:50:16] <nhulea>  (sunday === date1 && sunday === date2 && sunday === date3) for some reason this wont return true even though it is
[12:50:40] <NoiseEee> nhulea: you mean date1===date2===date3 ?
[12:51:13] <nhulea> NoiseEee: would it reduce to that ??
[12:51:27] <NoiseEee> well the only way that's going to be true is if date1===date2===date3
[12:51:53] <nhulea> shit that interesting
[12:51:55] <nhulea> thats
[12:52:12] <NoiseEee> did you mean || instead of && ?
[12:52:22] <nhulea> what about this one
[12:52:24] <nhulea> (sunday === date1 || saturday === date1 && sunday === date2 || saturday === date2 && sunday === date3 || saturday === date3)
[12:52:58] <NoiseEee> that seems confusing and i think operator precedence will bite you in the ass.
[12:52:59] <nhulea> I wanted to check if all 3 dates are a saturday or sunday
[12:53:12] <nhulea> all 3 are weekend days
[12:53:35] <JBreit> hi i am trying to figure out why my h2s disappear when I tried to toggle them considering that I did some code to make the div below them disappear and not the h2.  I am also trying to figure out why my toggle isn't working in general: http://jsfiddle.net/as6c5/8/
[12:53:53] <nhulea> NoiseEee: yeah if I use one it works
[12:54:02] <JBreit> I was able to get it to work on a previous property and not sure what I did wrong looking at the other thing for a comparison
[12:54:07] <ezakimak_work> just get day-of-week and test if they are > 5
[12:54:08] <nhulea> but all 3 it fails
[12:54:09] <NoiseEee> brush up on your logic there, nhulea
[12:54:55] <ezakimak_work> in fact, you could add them and test if > 15
[12:55:06] <nhulea> I thought I understood how the operators worked left to right && and , || or
[12:55:37] <NoiseEee> i'd also peek at moment's built-in methods
[12:55:53] <nhulea> yeah ok
[12:56:02] <ezakimak_work> && is higher precendence than ||
[12:56:20] <ezakimak_work> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence
[12:56:55] <nhulea> yeah  get that its just weird cause by themselves they are all true and then when I put them together false
[12:57:12] <walidvb> hi guys, i have a function that needs to take either prev() or next() as parameter.
[12:58:03] <walidvb> i made a function foo(bar){$('.myClass').bar()}, and then call foo($.prev), but it's obv not the right sentence...
[12:58:07] <walidvb> synta*, sorry
[13:00:17] <ezakimak_work> $('.myClass')[bar]()
[13:02:15] <walidvb> ezakimak_work: the problem is rather what to I pass to foo ?
[13:08:01] <walidvb> any other advice?
[13:08:23] <louism2wash> Hey guys, this may be more of a html question but you guys can probably help if I am using jquery to change the display property of page elements, how should that user interaction be handled?  Should I have the user click a button or a link?  Does it matter?  Could a style a <p> tag to look like a link that then use jquery to set a click handler on that <p> tag?  Thanks.
[13:08:50] <walidvb> louism2wash: you can do how you want
[13:08:58] <walidvb> usual is <a>
[13:09:23] <walidvb> theming is up to you, but do make it look like a button, not a link
[13:09:34] <walidvb> links are to go somewhere else, not change display
[13:09:59] <louism2wash> walidvb: ok, so I can do what I want but your advice would be to make it look like a button
[13:10:05] <louism2wash> walidvb: I appreciate it
[13:10:13] <ezakimak_work> walidvb, you said you were passing either 'next' or 'prev'
[13:10:26] <louism2wash> walidvb: Just trying to understand what is the most logical thing
[13:10:49] <walidvb> louism2wash: well, a href="#" is what you see the most, but it could really be anything
[13:10:57] <walidvb> there is no standard, afaik
[13:11:01] <walidvb> ezakimak_work: yes indeed
[13:11:05] <ezakimak_work> buttons do things, links navigate
[13:11:22] <ezakimak_work> links should always be safe to click, buttons not necessarily
[13:12:02] <walidvb> louism2wash: and if it's to toggle displays, i recommend www.bootstrap-switch.org
[13:12:13] <walidvb> ezakimak_work: so how should i do?
[13:12:41] <ezakimak_work> ew. that's a terrible control
[13:12:56] <walidvb> ezakimak_work: tastes and colors
[13:13:19] <ezakimak_work> a bad skeuomorph
[13:13:30] <walidvb> but i meant only for the idea, to theme a button like its function
[13:13:45] <walidvb> ezakimak_work: anyways... ;D
[13:15:23] <walidvb> if i pass it $().prev, it returns the following: Uncaught TypeError: Property 'function (c,d){var e=f.map(this,b,c);L.test(a)||(d=c),d&&typeof d=="string"&&(e=f.filter(d,e)),e=this.length>1&&!R[a]?f.unique(e):e,(this.length>1||N.test(d))&&M.test(a)&&(e=e.reverse());return this.pushStack(e,a,P.call(arguments).join(","))}' of object [object Object] is not a function
[13:15:27] <walidvb> oops sry
[13:15:35] <walidvb> which seems to be going in the right direction
[13:16:34] <walidvb> but still not there
[13:18:02] <walidvb> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/988800f4ddfc37db36e2
[13:18:04] <ezakimak_work> why would you pass it $().prev?
[13:18:07] <walidvb> that's my code
[13:18:17] <walidvb> ezakimak_work: cause i don't know what to pass it :P
[13:18:43] <walidvb> ezakimak_work: and the rest i tried didn't work
[13:18:46] <ezakimak_work> pass it: 'prev' or 'next'
[13:19:59] <walidvb> thing is, prev doesn't exist at the time of the call
[13:20:01] <walidvb> but lemme try
[13:20:39] <walidvb> ezakimak_work: Uncaught ReferenceError: prev is not defined
[13:22:19] <ezakimak_work> then why are you trying to call it if you know it doesn't exist
[13:22:44] <ezakimak_work> and how can a string literal ever not exist?
[13:22:53] <walidvb> because i'd like to pass the jQuery prev function
[13:23:13] <walidvb> that should then be called from the jQuery object
[13:23:18] <ezakimak_work> you're passing it the *name* of the function, and accessing it already via [] in your function
[13:23:43] <walidvb> ezakimak_work: look, i don't know how this work, if you know, you can explain, i'd be very grateful
[13:23:50] <ezakimak_work> from what scope do you want to call  $.prev ?
[13:23:53] <walidvb> but i do realize i'm doing smth wrong
[13:24:26] <ezakimak_work> did you try what I suggested yet? pass 'prev' ?
[13:24:39] <ezakimak_work> not prev. 'prev' (in quotes--a string)
[13:24:48] <walidvb> i want to call a function that runs either prev() or next() on a predefined jQuery(object)
[13:24:52] <walidvb> oh. no
[13:25:14] <walidvb> cheers
[13:25:16] <walidvb> it works
[13:25:38] <walidvb> how does that work, though, how is ['string']() processed as a fct?
[13:26:47] <walidvb> and thx
[13:31:09] <hpekdemir> hi
[13:31:11] <hpekdemir> I have this problem that I can not ws.send on an jquery "click" event on a button after a websocket once established connection to server.
[13:31:15] <hpekdemir> If I dont connect on document ready. the event gets fired.
[13:31:19] <hpekdemir> any hints?
[13:42:25] <HOrangeJewce> Hi, I'm attempting to do a jquery CORS request against a lighttpd 1.4.26 server via firefox 24, and even though I have the Access-Control-Expose-Headers field set for a custom header being returned when I make a POST request, I still don't have access to it via the getResponseHeader method. Is there something I am missing?
[13:42:56] <ezakimak_work> getResponseHeader is not implemented well by many browsers
[13:43:01] <ezakimak_work> for CORS that is
[13:43:24] <HOrangeJewce> I get null when using Chromium as well.
[13:43:45] <ezakimak_work> just assume you can't get headers from CORS responses
[13:45:37] <HOrangeJewce> Anything other than simple headers you mean ezakimak?
[13:46:39] <krambiorix> hi, i have set a width on a div of 22% with css... How can i get the calculated real width of the div in pixels?
[13:47:41] <ezakimak_work> window.getComputedStyle(thediv).width
[13:50:18] <hpekdemir> what does "ws is not defined" mean? http://nopaste.info/669ee6e474.html
[13:53:10] <krambiorix> ezakimak_work,  i can't work with classes ?
[13:53:56] <NoiseEee> hpekdemir: paste rendered scripts, not php/asp/etc
[13:53:57] <ezakimak_work> be more specific
[13:55:01] <krambiorix> ezakimak_work, i can't use the normal selectors like getComputedStyle(".mydiv input") ?
[13:55:35] <ezakimak_work> window.getComputedStyle($(some jq selector).el).width
[13:55:53] <krambiorix> ow ok thanks!
[14:02:41] <jphase> Anyone ever have issues with IE not allowing CORS requests with .load()? I've gotten to the point where I've confirmed there's an error (only in IE) and it console.logs "oh noes!!!" but don't have much info past that. I've also read some stuff about utf-8 encoding which I've applied to my server-side scripts and still no worky :(
[14:12:01] <jphase> in case anyone retroactively reads my last question and wants example code:   http://hastebin.com/xoremidara.xml   (forgive the apex b.s. from SalesForce)
[14:25:41] <zakj> jphase: your code seems to be working for me in IE10; are you in an older version?
[14:26:30] <jphase> no, I'm in IE10 too... so you see the page on https://signaturehospice.secure.force.com/careers ?
[14:27:00] <jphase> says "oh noes!!!!" and my [object Object] in teh consolez :`[
[14:27:35] <zakj> ah yep, I see that on your page. what's working for me was copy/pasting the file you hastebined
[14:28:14] <zakj> so I wonder if some of that apex business is affecting your results, since that's doing nothing on my server
[14:29:21] <zakj> you are ending up with a bunch of elements following the closing </html> tag; I wonder if that makes IE unhappy?
[14:29:52] <jphase> yeah, it does make it unhappy, but I confirmed that's not the issue after reverting back to another page template (that's actually SF that does that... gross right?)
[14:30:02] <zakj> seriously!
[14:30:34] <jphase> and the other b.s. that's on the page in the source is this 3rd-party company called "Job Science" that codes rather ghetto as well, but also confirmed that's not the issue
[14:30:56] <jphase> so after my console.log with the oh noes!!!! it's definitely an issue with the CORS request, but idfk why or what
[14:31:13] <jphase> I read a bit on stack overflow about utf-8 encoding, added that to my PHP headers before pooping out content too, no dice :(
[14:33:30] <zakj> interesting data point: I copy/pasted the source from https://signaturehospice.secure.force.com/careers into a static file, added jquery from CDN, put it behind nginx, and I'm seeing content in IE10
[14:34:10] <zakj> of course that means I'm missing a bunch of the other scripts/styles from that page, since they're all relative URLs
[14:34:49] <jphase> !!!
[14:34:58] <jphase> that means there's something encoding related or something on the server then yes?
[14:35:04] <jphase> what on earf?!
[14:35:21] <zakj> or something in one of the other scripts on that page that's in conflict, perhaps?
[14:36:12] <jphase> gotcha, good debugging, thanks buddy!
[14:36:16] <jphase> oh, hi btw!!! :D
[14:36:34] <zakj> Oh, also I'm using jquery 1.10.1, which may have different behavior than your 1.7.2 :/
[14:36:38] <zakj> and hi! ;)
[14:37:28] <zakj> (nope, jquery version wasn't the problem)
[14:37:34] <jphase> yeah, I went to 1.9.1 yesterday to try that and it no worky
[14:37:35] <jphase> yeah :(
[14:37:42] <jphase> but good to know, something server-related
[14:37:48] <jphase> or script conflicty
[14:37:55] <jphase> (somehow only in IE)
[14:37:59] * jphase feels like he's playing clue
[14:40:26] <Bloomberg> hello guys!!
[14:41:40] <Nephro> Hello, I request html via ajax and it comes in a weird way. My select element seems empty, even though it is not empty in the source... any explanation for that?
[14:49:22] <jphase> Nephro: can you hit the link from your ajax request in your browser and see the stuff you want?
[14:50:17] <Nephro> jphase, yes
[14:50:26] <jphase> hmm, that is odd indeed
[14:54:40] <Zy> I'm having trouble with a jquery-ui buttonset. The first time I click one of the "select" buttons, everything is fine. But after that, the buttonset appears to die. I don't know why it isn't staying alive. Anyone available to help me?
[14:54:44] <Nephro> jphase, maybe there is some sort of command for the browser to reinitialize elements?
[14:55:58] <jphase> Nephro: have you tried using .load instead of .ajax?
[14:56:20] <Nephro> no
[14:57:01] <jphase> Nephro: try that... $('div#mydiv').load('http://yoururl.com', function(){ // stuff to do after you're done });
[14:57:25] <jphase> Nephro: but in theory you should be able to use a regular ajax request with a good contentType I believe
[14:59:05] <Zy> here's the test site: http://celebnoli.hostingsiteforfree.com/
[14:59:17] <Zy> click the "About" and you'll see something load
[14:59:28] <Zy> after that, the button set isn't clickable
[15:01:14] <Zy> I've reproduced the problem here, although it looks different because of missing files:  http://jsfiddle.net/ZyDanielson/ULH7d/
[15:01:35] <christo_m> hello, im looking for sometching like this but free http://codecanyon.net/item/jquery-tiles-gallery/2281417
[15:02:16] <christo_m> Basically Masonry image tiling
[15:02:52] <christo_m> However i want to be able to control the size ratios based on some parameters then have it tile based on that automatically
[15:03:02] <christo_m> ie , i would like some images to be bigger thumbnails than others based on some criteria
[15:04:00] <Zy> I just can't figure out why the buttonset isn't clickable the 2nd time
[15:05:35] <christo_m> Zy: why are your semicolons sitting outside ?
[15:05:56] <christo_m> <input type="radio" id="radio2" name="radio" onclick="loadAbout()" ;="" class="ui-helper-hidden-accessible">
[15:06:01] <Zy> thought I fixed that, maybe I didn't save it ... sec
[15:07:18] <Zy> yeah, forgot to update it
[15:07:21] <christo_m> Zy: http://www.celebnoli.com/ is this your site?
[15:07:31] <Zy> unfortunately it doesn't change anything
[15:07:51] <christo_m> i wouldnt think so, just wondering why the semicolon was there
[15:07:54] <Zy> no, the domain is parked
[15:08:11] <christo_m> i dont know what you're doing
[15:08:18] <christo_m> with regards to this js
[15:08:37] <christo_m> but if you're developing a nav this way, i wuold rethink your design
[15:08:50] <Zy> here is the test site: http://celebnoli.hostingsiteforfree.com/
[15:09:19] <Zy> using a .buttonset as a nav bar
[15:09:43] <christo_m> ya i wouldnt do it this way
[15:09:48] <Zy> using ajax to load content when a button in the buttonset is clicked
[15:10:06] <Zy> the "Home" button in the buttonset just hides what is open
[15:10:43] <christo_m> well a) you're using radio buttons..
[15:10:52] <christo_m> i mean, theres nothing wrong with just making them hrefs and then binding an onclick that way
[15:10:55] <Zy> yeah, but each has an onclick event
[15:10:59] <christo_m> im aware
[15:11:11] <christo_m> i dunno man, this is just so against my thinking that i cant debug it lol
[15:11:24] <Zy> thing is, after the first load for some reason I can't click it again
[15:11:30] <Zy> so the onclick event doesn't fire
[15:11:39] <christo_m> lol
[15:11:55] <Zy> what's really wierd is that this was working when I had the buttonset at the bottom of the page
[15:12:07] <christo_m> maybe a div is covering it
[15:12:09] <Zy> then I moved it to the top and who knows what else I did, and it stopped working
[15:12:11] <Zy> LOL
[15:12:27] <christo_m> ya scroll-wrapper is blocking it
[15:12:29] <christo_m> yo is this your first site man?
[15:12:32] <Zy> I'm a bit of a jquery and jquery-ui noob, to state the obvious.
[15:12:34] <christo_m> i mean we all start somewhere but damn.
[15:12:35] <mortal1> could someone point me to some api docu regarding the date type?  http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Date doesn't seem to exist
[15:13:09] <christo_m> mortal1: i think Date type is a native javascript type.
[15:13:13] <christo_m> you dont need the jquery api for it
[15:13:44] <christo_m> mortal1: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp
[15:13:55] <mortal1> christo_m: yeah i'm looking at it now
[15:14:05] <mortal1> thanks, i didn't realize js had a date type
[15:15:06] <gnu_d> Hi, how come I can't wrap a video element ?
[15:15:19] <gnu_d> says: TypeError: video_obj.wrapAll is not a function
[15:15:35] <Zy> I don't know how the scroll-wrapper is blocking it tho. The nav div is outside that object
[15:15:57] <christo_m> Zy: probably the way you're reloading shit into the DOM dude
[15:16:13] <jessesnyder> If anyone can explain to me this (to me) surprising behavior form .find() I'd be extremely grateful: http://pastie.org/8393563
[15:16:35] <christo_m> yo pro advice, use bootstrap or something
[15:16:44] <Zy> so I'm doing all this wrong? (thought I was doing so well, learning all this)
[15:18:52] <Zy> could it be that what I'm loading into the scroll-middle-inner div with ajax, is a full page with its own <html><head> etc?
[15:19:04] <Zy> should it be just the inside elements of that page?
[15:21:05] <christo_m> okay does anyone know of a free image masonry tiling plugin, specifically one that allows me to adjust the sizes and then have it tile based on those image sizes??
[15:24:39] <Zy> I tried taking the <html></html> and <head></head> tags out of the .load() file ... wondering if that was messing up the DOM ... but didn't help
[15:28:23] <jphase> zakj: so... turns out it was indeed that invalid markup that those "Job Science" morons wrote... I disabled their apex "add on" and my CORS requests went through just fine....
[15:28:33] <zakj> huzzah!
[15:28:36] * jphase composes email.... subject: "Invalid markup"
[15:29:03] <jphase> I mean, I don't even care about w3c compliance, but datepickers and script tags after </html>  .... .really???
[15:30:27] <zakj> jphase: you should probably bill them for the time you spent debugging their junk ;)
[15:31:26] <jphase> zakj: oh you know it!  times 3 (which is how many friends were kind enough to open IE with me and brainstorm)
[15:34:39] <christo_m> basically need a tag cloud of images
[15:34:41] <christo_m> if that exists
[15:34:51] <christo_m> so far it looks like ill have to implement some kind of packing algorithm
[15:34:59] <christo_m> i cant believe no one has done this before :S
[15:37:59] <christo_m> http://masonry.desandro.com/ guess ill try this for now
[15:49:39] <dr_dimitru> Hey everyone, do you have any idea how to bind/trigger event for every select without result? For example if $('#el') is not found do some function. Need to do this for all empty results.
[15:49:54] <Zy> fixed it
[15:50:48] <Zy> christo_m, still here?
[15:51:03] <cusco> dr_dimitru: i'm not understanding, how does a select has results?
[15:51:07] <cusco> a select has options
[15:51:29] <Zy> all I had to do was set z-index of the #nav to 2, and z-index of the scroll-wrapper to 1
[15:51:29] <cusco> you could use length to know if a #el exists
[15:51:37] <Zy> works like a charm
[15:51:47] <dr_dimitru> I meant Selector $('')
[15:52:13] <Zy> (since they are both positioned absolute)
[15:53:06] <cusco> dr_dimitru: same: use .length
[15:53:54] <cusco> if ($('#el').length) {there is a element #el}
[15:54:21] <dr_dimitru> Yeh... it works.. but how to bind it to every selection I do in document?
[15:54:55] <cusco> I don't understand...
[15:56:36] <dr_dimitru> cusco: I need to do check "if ($('#el').length){...}" every time I run selection in document
[15:56:45] <martisj> morning
[15:57:27] <cusco> I don't understand 'run a selection in the document'
[15:57:32] <cusco> night martisj
[15:57:57] <martisj> I want to attach an autocomplete widget to dynamically generated input fields. One input field is visible by default.
[15:58:12] <zakj> dr_dimitru: I don't think jQuery has a hook for that. You could write another function that wraps your .length check and use that instead of $('#el'); e.g. function $sel(selector) { var selection = $(selector); if (selection.length < 1) { ... }; return selection };
[15:58:44] <martisj> How do i pass a jquery object to function in the best possible manner?
[15:58:54] <martisj> I don't really see how to do this basically.
[15:59:32] <jphase> martisj: you can do it with either the selector or the object itself.... function yolo($('div')) {    or     function yolo('div') {
[15:59:56] <dr_dimitru> ok, let's say in other way: run a function every time I do $('..'), then I can do whatever I want with returned object.
[15:59:57] <jphase> woops
[15:59:59] <jphase> syntax issue there
[16:00:22] <dr_dimitru> zakj: yeah you understand me, thanks
[16:00:22] <jphase> martisj: take off the function on those, muh bad
[16:01:08] <martisj> jphase: take off the function?
[16:01:25] <martisj> oh right when calling it
[16:01:35] <jphase> martisj: sorry... like.....     function yolo(myvar){      then you could pass it like.....     yolo($('div')) for example
[16:01:44] <martisj> and that is the best way to deal with dynamically generated inputs ?
[16:02:01] <jphase> martisj: you can also pass just the selector like   yolo('div')   and then use $(myvar) inside your function
[16:02:20] <martisj> and in function yolo(jqObj){ jqObj.autocomplete({ // lots options }); } ?
[16:02:36] <martisj> jphase: thanks :)
[16:02:37] <jphase> martisj: you can just add .autocomplete onto the element as it's created
[16:02:43] <jphase> but yeah, you could function wrap it too
[16:02:44] <martisj> jphase: word :)
[16:03:27] <martisj> can i make an option object stored as a variable and then pass that to the autocopmlete method?
[16:03:57] <jphase> sure
[16:04:21] <dr_dimitru> zakj: strange what I can not bind any event on every $(''). There is any way to catch every $('#selector') and goto: function $sel($('#selector')) { var selection = $(selector); if (selection.length < 1) { ... }; return selection }; ?
[16:04:22] <jphase> like var yolo = $('div');    then use   yolo.autocomplete(); yeah
[16:05:53] <martisj> jphase: oh I was thinking of the options I pass to autocomplete(----> { focus: function (){} } <----);  the options/parameter inside the ----> <----
[16:06:12] <jphase> martisj: oh yes, you can do that too
[16:06:22] <martisj> jphase: awesome :)
[16:06:23] <martisj> thanks
[16:07:08] <zakj> dr_dimitru: not that I'm aware of, no
[16:07:24] <jphase> np
[16:08:33] <dr_dimitru> zakj: Anyways thank you.
[16:08:57] <martisj> jphase: and for the first input field that is visible on the page from the get go, i would just go $('#theFirst').autocomplete(settings);  right ?
[16:09:30] <jphase> martisj: sounds good to me
[16:09:49] <martisj> jphase: beautiful :)
[16:09:50] <martisj> thanks
[16:09:55] <zakj> dr_dimitru: no problem!
[16:09:58] <martisj> I'm refactoring some old poo
[16:10:23] <jphase> mmm, old poo
[16:10:28] <martisj> It was running autocomplete on the focus.autocomplete event
[16:11:50] <dr_dimitru> zakj: do you know what I can do inside of: (function( $ ) {..})( jQuery ); ?
[16:12:50] <jphase> dr_dimitru: anything your little heart desires ;)
[16:13:52] <dr_dimitru> jphase: sounds awesome even catch/bind some function for every Selector $('#el')?
[16:13:56] <martisj> do vars have to be declared before i use them?
[16:14:05] <zakj> dr_dimitru: haha
[16:14:16] <jphase> hehe
[16:14:43] <jphase> dr_dimitru: you can bind stuffs yeah. :D
[16:14:52] <jphase> bindage.... sweeeeeet sweet bindage
[16:15:36] <dr_dimitru> jphase: will run some tests now.. we will see
[16:15:43] <martisj> yes ofcuz
[16:15:57] <jphase> martisj: yesm
[16:16:35] <martisj> hahaha this is awesome autocompletes:
[16:16:51] <martisj> if i do three spaces. it shows all users with three names.
[16:17:02] <martisj> My bug is a feature
[16:19:39] <jphase> can I get an amen for diff merge?!?
[16:20:30] <martisj> jphase: abrakadabra
[16:20:36] <martisj> almost
[16:21:12] <martisj> so i stored the options in a var and it works on the first element, but not on the subsequent ones that get generated.
[16:23:00] <jphase> martisj: try creating them, then appending them to wherever you need, then doing the autocomplete call
[16:24:08] <martisj> jphase: this is what i've got for the generating of inputs
[16:24:09] <martisj> http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/6Mpre/
[16:24:28] <royalty> hello
[16:24:58] <royalty> so lets say I have a class attachment and I want to select all children classes of attachment labeled row
[16:25:11] <royalty> would I do $('.attachment > .row')
[16:25:18] <martisj> ah right i'm not adding the autocomplete to the right element.
[16:25:20] <jphase> martisj: outside of using .live (deprecated) I don't see any issue with that, hard to tell though
[16:25:26] <martisj> it's attaching autcomplete to a table row
[16:25:31] <jphase> ahh, there ya go, I don't know your markup
[16:25:35] <martisj> jphase: and yes we are using tbales for layout :SSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[16:25:42] <martisj> jphase: thanks ;)
[16:25:49] <martisj> rubber duck debugging
[16:26:01] <jphase> hehe, epic table layouts ftw hehe
[16:26:12] <jphase> I just opened one of those up the other day, hurt my head a bit
[16:27:23] <zakj> royalty: that's right; just remember that that selector will only target *immediate* .row children of .attachments, not any descendant.
[16:28:00] <martisj> jphase: i've been struggling with this barf for three days now
[16:28:02] <martisj> jeeex
[16:28:11] <royalty> zakj: ah alright thanks I got that part sorted!
[16:36:31] <raj> shoky, if all the other placeholders are #999, so should the empty select
[16:38:49] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. I have an iframe and I need to control the style or inject some custom CSS inside of that iframe on my site. Thoughts?
[16:40:25] <raj> LindsayMac, according to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/217776/how-to-apply-css-to-iframe , you can add a <link> to the iframe
[16:41:11] <LindsayMac> raj:  i see that. Can I do that on an iframe hosted from a different domain?
[16:41:47] <LindsayMac> "Just so no1 else has to test it to find out: correct, it doesn't work cross-domain. I"
[16:41:48] <LindsayMac> poo
[16:42:40] <martisj> should appendto be the last thing you do for dynamically generated content?
[16:43:05] <Mason> anyone know the name of the box that pops up in the bottom-left corner of your browser when you mouseover a link?
[16:43:18] <raj> martisj, if you don't want it to show the content building
[16:43:20] <martisj> Mason: status bar
[16:43:32] <martisj> raj: yeah that makes sense
[16:43:46] <Mason> thanks, jquieryui has an issue with it in chrome and i was having trouble finding anything related in the bug tracker
[16:43:47] <martisj> can i do find() two times on a jquery object?
[16:43:51] <martisj> seems wrong to me
[16:44:03] <raj> martisj, yes
[16:46:00] <martisj> it is wrong?
[16:46:36] <martisj> raj: this is what i ahve http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/6Mpre/1/
[16:46:49] <martisj> and it's not doing what i was expecting so ??!? it must be wrong.
[16:46:52] * martisj feels very smart
[16:48:29] <martisj> is there a way to get the number of the index in an each() call?
[16:48:49] <martisj> indeed there is
[16:50:05] <martisj> what is it called when i go from $.each(function() {})  to $.each(function(index){})   ?? am i getting a parameter | adding a parameter | listening for awesomeness ?!?!
[16:51:19] <shoky> raj, wat
[16:52:36] <shoky> martisj: all of the above
[16:53:09] <martisj> shoky: well that's interesting
[16:53:21] <martisj> fuck this!
[16:53:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[16:57:32] * martisj opens up opera to converse with all-knowing dragonfly of life
[16:57:37] * martisj and death
[17:04:19] <martisj> this is bloody awful.
[17:04:26] <martisj> autocomplete can
[17:16:49] <raj> shoky, I'm saying for visual consistency, I think selects should have color:#999 for the empty option
[17:17:05] <raj> but who the bl**p cares what I think
[17:19:34] <tw2113> talk to the browser makers
[17:20:42] <raj> tw2113, they can get their act together when they do
[17:21:00] <raj> I wanna polyfill it with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5805059/select-placeholder
[17:21:07] <raj> "polyfill"
[17:21:37] <tw2113> until you give them your feedback, you have to wait potentially longer for it to get fixed
[17:22:23] <raj> you're right
[17:23:19] <raj> done
[17:24:50] <raj> How can I make it so every select on load and dynamically created follows http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5805059/select-placeholder
[17:25:03] <raj> without repeating
[17:33:36] <martisj> how come the autocomplete doesn't get applied to subsequent .search-sgroup-user-<?=$position?> 's here http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/6Mpre/2/
[17:33:37] <martisj> ?
[17:33:44] <martisj> I can't make sense of it
[17:39:35] <raj> martisj, the id's in your <a> have '-', and your selector $('#add_to_study_group') uses '_'
[17:40:13] <martisj> raj: that's for the add new input button
[17:40:44] <NeoThermic> martisj: I'm assuming <?=$position?> comes from PHP?
[17:41:17] <martisj> NeoThermic: indeed
[17:41:30] <martisj> this is the real markup: http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/6Mpre/3/
[17:41:39] <martisj> gaaa  makes me want to die
[17:42:18] <NeoThermic> heh. At least you're not stuck triyng to debug a sorting function :P
[17:49:03] <NeoThermic> http://neothermic.com/testing/sorttest.html -- simplified my issue into a test case
[17:49:10] <NeoThermic> can't get any closer to resolving it, though :|
[17:57:48] <martisj> NeoThermic: true.
[17:58:11] <NeoThermic> the biggest issue is that I can't get console.log to fire inside that sort
[17:58:16] <NeoThermic> so I have no idea what the sort is seeing
[18:12:25] <nardev> hello, is it possible to track and see if content of some div is changed by something like this $('#someDiv').html();change( ?
[18:12:44] <nardev> It should be set/changed by other JS which i can't trace :(
[18:13:10] <NeoThermic> http://api.jquery.com/change/ ?
[18:13:10] <duch_kazatel> nardev sort of, but why?
[18:13:32] <duch_kazatel> NeoThermic That's for form elements
[18:13:36] <NeoThermic> ah, yes
[18:13:39] <duch_kazatel> rather, form input elements
[18:13:56] <nardev> i a particular case, only one part of webpage is changed, i don't know how else i can track if it was changed or not :( duch_kazatel
[18:21:00] <martisj> does anybody know the difference between search and source option for the autocomplete widget?
[18:21:06] <martisj> http://api.jqueryui.com/1.8/autocomplete/#option-source
[18:21:11] <martisj> can't wrap my head around it :S
[18:22:16] <jphase> martisj: source is a data source, search is either a method or event
[18:27:57] <martisj> So we should be using source for the data. ATM everything is in the search event. :(
[18:30:02] <jphase> yeah, use source for your data
[18:30:34] <jphase> martisj: you can pass a function to your source option that returns your data from an ajax call as well btw
[18:32:44] <martisj> jphase: yeah that's what i'm doing now
[18:32:49] <martisj> or at least rtying to do.
[18:33:17] <martisj> however i still can't get the dynamically generated inputs to use the autocomplete widget
[18:35:23] <jphase> martisj: how are you creating your inputs? On an event of some sort?
[18:37:46] <martisj> jphase: yeah click of a link
[18:37:53] <martisj> and then i'm cloning a table row
[18:37:56] <martisj> really ghetto shit
[18:39:32] <timbozeman> I have a .hidden css class and a function that $(close).addClass('hidden'); $(open).removeClass('hidden'); For some reason it does removeClass before add regardless of what order they come in. Does removeClass have precedence or something? I can't seem to wrap my head around this.
[18:40:09] <martisj> jphase: here we gogos http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/6Mpre/4/
[18:40:53] <shoky> timbozeman: no there is no precedence
[18:41:46] <martisj> timbozeman: show some more of your code
[18:42:10] <timbozeman> martisj: okay I'll do a fiddle <3
[18:42:30] <jphase> martisj: hmm, try something similar to this perhaps:   http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/3VCdq/
[18:42:51] <jphase> martisj: granted, I'm just firing the creation of the element on focus, so idk what you need to do
[18:44:21] <martisj> jphase: i'm liking the comments :)
[18:44:22] <martisj> hahahah
[18:44:30] <jphase> ;)
[18:44:34] <martisj> that looks exactly like what i need :)
[18:44:54] <jphase> oh, well sweet
[18:45:26] <jphase> martisj: so yeah, you can just replace "source: testsource"   with something like.... source: function(){ // ajax stuff goes here, then return data ;) }
[18:45:44] <martisj> well it looks like another way of doing it
[18:45:48] <martisj> maybe it is the only way
[18:46:22] <martisj> i was trying to store all the options of the autocomplete in an object literal and using that as the reference
[18:46:25] <jphase> there are several ways to accomplish what you're trying to do, but any time I recall the same function (to create the element and bind autocomplete in this case), I always just reuse
[18:46:30] <martisj> a function is probably better
[18:46:31] <jphase> recycle reduce reuse!
[18:46:38] <jphase> you can do that too
[18:46:40] <martisj> jphase: yeah baby!!!
[18:46:47] <martisj> jphase: well i can't get that working
[18:46:50] <martisj> so i'll try yours
[18:46:57] <martisj> how come you chose to do a named function in that way?
[18:47:13] <martisj> when would i use var cray = function () {}; ?
[18:47:39] <jphase> you can do that too, there's really no reason besides that I declared it on load
[18:47:47] <jphase> the bottom call that starts the first
[18:48:07] <jphase> otherwise you'd have to define the same function twice yeah?
[18:48:39] <jphase> martisj: and I also get a nerd boner on recursive functions so... FTW! :D
[18:51:52] <martisj> jphase: hahaha :)
[18:51:52] <martisj> nice
[18:52:04] <martisj> jphase: thanks
[18:52:07] <jphase> np
[18:53:08] <martisj> i'm really at a loss
[18:53:09] <martisj> still doesn't work
[18:53:10] <martisj> fuck
[18:53:46] <jphase> oh?
[18:53:59] <jphase> martisj: you have a working example I can browse?
[18:55:18] <martisj> haven't reduced it to a test case yet

[19:14:53] <martisj> jphase: np
[19:15:59] <martisj> timbozeman: you could use hide(0, function() { $('#open').show()});
[19:16:09] <jphase> timbozeman: do you have to use transitions for this?
[19:16:25] <martisj> the second param for hide() is a callback that fires when the element is hidden
[19:16:39] <utroda> jphase: I'm on my dev environment, and root is just my local path. the ajax is returning everything correctly and the logs are returning the correct data, it appends nothing to the body.
[19:16:46] <timbozeman> jphase: I guess not, but isn't css3 hardware accellerated and jquery animations aren't?
[19:17:10] <utroda> jphase: you can see what the logs return in the comments
[19:18:00] <timbozeman> not that this is a taxing thing on the system... just the principle heh
[19:19:01] <martisj> timbozeman: i don't understand what the error is?
[19:19:13] <martisj> and why are you alerting in the middle of everything
[19:19:54] <timbozeman> martisj: oh no error, huh? oh sorry that was my bad I sent you an unfinished fiddle:   this is goodhttp://jsfiddle.net/jphase/pHHHp/6/
[19:20:06] <timbozeman> whoops space ^
[19:21:31] <martisj> and what do you want to happen instead?
[19:21:54] <timbozeman> I would like the top box to close before the bottom one opens
[19:23:00] <martisj> i see
[19:23:43] <timbozeman> martisj: erggh i suck. i just realized j phase added toggleClass. I'm not helping. My link was http://jsfiddle.net/pHHHp/5/
[19:24:52] <jphase> utroda: hmm, overall it looks okay but it's hard for me to debug without seeing exactly what the data source is (I do see your comments, thank you, but I can't seem to get an error as you mentioned, and it'd be tough debug this without my network tab workin')
[19:25:46] <jphase> utroda: if you have the time and can't figure it out, try to maybe setup the ajax response as a variable, take away all the local server stuff, and make a fiddle that will run so I can see it stand-alone and I'll gladly help troubleshoot
[19:27:32] <jphase> martisj: hmm, take away that PHP short tag in there and get this to work in fiddle and I'll help ya
[19:27:47] <jphase> matijs: convert to front-end, server side makes fiddle cry
[19:28:39] <martisj> jphase: i though i took it all out :S
[19:28:48] <jphase> hehe, all good, just that one little short tag in there
[19:28:59] <jphase> well, I suppose I can do this for you
[19:29:27] <jphase> hmm
[19:30:07] <jphase> martisj: nah, can't find what you're trying to target in the markup at:  empty_sgroup_row <?= $position ?> .clone
[19:30:35] <martisj> yeah i see that now :)
[19:30:55] * jphase passes out from 15 jsfiddle tabs open
[19:31:02] <martisj> jphase: here we goo :)http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/6Mpre/10/
[19:31:07] <martisj> jphase: shit
[19:31:11] <martisj> sorry mate
[19:31:22] * martisj must have coffee...
[19:31:40] <jphase> oic
[19:34:20] <jphase> martisj: you must have some gnarly markup that needs filtering eh?
[19:35:22] <martisj> jphase: indeeed
[19:35:32] <martisj> gnarly is a very appropriate word!!!
[19:38:15] <timbozeman> ok I can't believe the bottom one opens first on this... wtf http://jsfiddle.net/pHHHp/9/
[19:42:59] <martisj> timbozeman: hahaha :)
[19:43:02] <martisj> it's pretty awesomes :)
[19:43:30] <timbozeman> i really don't understand that. its a head scratcher
[19:43:47] <jphase> timbozeman: the reason that's happening is cause jQuery and CSS transitions are quite different. jQuery will just fire all its operations in order, not accounting for the transition speed or most other things attached to that css
[19:43:55] <jphase> I'd suggest doing that stuff entirely in jQuery
[19:44:06] <martisj> jphase: word!
[19:44:08] <martisj> i second that
[19:44:09] <jphase> or entirely in CSS, if possible, one of the two
[19:44:26] <jphase> mmm split pea soup
[19:44:44] <martisj> jphase: get a chance to look at my fiddlery ?
[19:44:49] <martisj> http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/6Mpre/10/
[19:44:52] <jphase> workin' on it now
[19:45:18] <timbozeman> thank you jphase and martisj
[19:45:27] <jphase> ;)
[19:49:45] <martisj> jphase: awesome thanks
[19:50:15] <martisj> earlier it worked but it was doing some funky stuff with events and listenning for a focus.autocomplete event
[19:50:18] <martisj> and it was just hell
[19:57:37] <jphase> martisj: there's really no way to rework this markup?
[19:57:51] <jphase> what a bear
[19:58:35] <martisj> jphase: there is, but it might be connected to some other crap, such tightly coupled code we have.
[19:58:36] <martisj> oh dear
[19:58:44] <martisj> what do you suggest though?
[19:58:45] <jphase> gotcha
[19:58:46] <martisj> just a list?
[19:59:15] <jphase> well, I would suggest most other things than this, but also the fact that we're cloning an element with an ID in there also hurts my soul a bit
[20:00:15] <jphase> I'm close but having same issue with odd autocompletion not firing
[20:00:29] <jphase> let me smoke a bowl and turn on some drum and bass and see if I can't debug this
[20:01:06] <jphase> :D
[20:01:06] <martisj> jphase: hahah :)
[20:01:07] <martisj> sick :)
[20:01:10] <martisj> what a legend!!!
[20:01:28] <JimmyXander> Hello
[20:01:30] <JimmyXander> question
[20:01:32] <JimmyXander> http://jsfiddle.net
[20:01:41] <JimmyXander> how can I add 64px to the offset
[20:01:55] <JimmyXander> because I have a fixed nav
[20:03:32] <JimmyXander> anyone?
[20:03:43] <jphase>  JimmyXander hmm, your link seems to be a bit vague ;)
[20:04:03] <JimmyXander> It's a super basic scroll to top
[20:04:04] <JimmyXander> jquery
[20:04:11] <JimmyXander> just need to at 64 pixels
[20:04:22] <JimmyXander> It does smooth scrolling
[20:04:23] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/Pq5Cv/8/       <--  how do i make this work onload?   it won't work on my server
[20:04:41] <JimmyXander> so whatever is clicked gets smooth scrolled to
[20:04:55] <JimmyXander> but I need to account for the height of my fixed nac
[20:04:57] <JimmyXander> nav*
[20:05:05] <JimmyXander> and I don't know enough about javascript to figure it out
[20:05:07] <jphase> JimmyXander: you do realize you just linked us to jsfiddle without a fiddle right?
[20:05:33] <JimmyXander> http://jsfiddle.net/qqS4B/
[20:05:35] <JimmyXander> lmao
[20:05:39] <JimmyXander> you are quite right
[20:05:49] <JimmyXander> the script works just fine
[20:06:04] <JimmyXander> I just need to add 64px to the result
[20:07:21] <jphase> JimmyXander: can't tell without markup :(
[20:07:34] <jphase> JimmyXander: looks good at first glance
[20:07:36] <JimmyXander> its markup agnostic...
[20:07:42] <JimmyXander> it just takes any anchor
[20:07:48] <JimmyXander> and smooth scrolls to it
[20:08:23] <jphase> JimmyXander: by "result" you mean the top offset?
[20:08:30] <JimmyXander> yes
[20:08:37] <jphase> scrollTop: $(href).offset().top + 64
[20:08:53] <jphase> if that doesn't work, perhaps parseInt() around it?
[20:09:08] <jphase> pretty sure top offset returns int though :\
[20:09:24] <JimmyXander> I'm an idiot
[20:09:25] <JimmyXander> yeah
[20:09:26] <JimmyXander> that was it
[20:09:27] <JimmyXander> thanks
[20:09:38] <JimmyXander> + -64 worked perfectly
[20:09:47] <jphase> JimmyXander: not an idiot, just need a new pair of eyes ;)
[20:10:07] <jphase> (meaning another person)
[20:10:43] <JimmyXander> thanks
[20:10:56] <jphase> np
[20:15:57] <martisj> jphase: how'd you go with that bowl ?
[20:16:08] * jphase is out :(
[20:16:16] <jphase> was all excited until I opened the container
[20:22:27] <martisj> jphase: ah snap that sucks
[20:22:28] <martisj> haha ;)
[20:26:31] <jphase> bah
[20:26:34] <jphase> this sucks
[20:26:58] <jphase> I had it working on cloned/appended elements, then it didn't work on the first :\
[20:29:13] <nardev> is it possible to use selectors like this
[20:29:23] <nardev> 'ul.someclass' ?
[20:29:31] <martisj> nardev: yes
[20:29:37] <nardev> i want to append something in ul
[20:29:37] <nardev> :(
[20:29:43] <martisj> nardev: yes
[20:29:50] <martisj> that can be done fairly trivially
[20:30:02] <nardev> martisj, :( seems i messed something else
[20:30:04] <martisj> jphase: really?? how the heck did you get the clone working?
[20:30:12] <willbeeler> hi everyone... can someone take a look at this pastebin,. just a couple of lines of code? http://pastebin.com/RrDvejti
[20:30:13] <martisj> nardev: jsfiddle it
[20:30:29] <martisj> willbeeler: that is extremely vague
[20:30:29] <nardev> martisj, if i don't find it soon :)
[20:30:31] <willbeeler> the first variable, uploadID.val(theid);  is work
[20:30:35] <willbeeler> is working
[20:30:45] <willbeeler> but the second one does not prepend the html
[20:30:46] <martisj> just ask the question
[20:30:50] <martisj> and let us know the error
[20:30:59] <willbeeler> the second one does not prepend the html
[20:31:02] <martisj> why it isn't working, what you want to achieve., etc
[20:31:14] <martisj> willbeeler: also use jsfiddle.net
[20:31:24] <willbeeler> ok 1 sec
[20:31:57] <nardev> martisj, it seems that append is not what i need, What method should i use if i want to add li element into $('ul.someClass').???
[20:32:06] <jphase> willbeeler: the_img isn't defined in that pastebin
[20:32:22] <willbeeler> i know.. i've already validated it and it works fine
[20:32:32] <willbeeler> im sorry. i will give you something more complete in a moment
[20:32:47] <nardev> anyone can help me?
[20:32:51] <martisj> nardev: append is exactly what you want
[20:32:55] <nardev> ok
[20:33:14] <martisj> you need to make the li first though.
[20:33:39] <jphase> martisj: something is effed in this.... as soon as I get one to work, the other breaks :\
[20:33:42] <martisj> var myli = $('<li>');  $('ul.someClass').append(myli);
[20:33:47] <martisj> something like that
[20:33:56] <martisj> jphase: it's bloody retarded isn't it??!?!
[20:34:00] <jphase> yeah!
[20:34:06] <martisj> i might just have to rewrite the markup
[20:34:18] <jphase> martisj: if you have the ability, I would DEFINITELY do so
[20:34:41] <jphase> martisj: I get that this may or may not have some dependency though, I deal with crap like this at work all the time
[20:34:45] * martisj doesn't want to look in svn to see who made that markup. afraid it could be him :S
[20:34:47] <martisj> hahahahaah
[20:34:50] <nardev> martisj, i think that i got it
[20:35:55] <jphase> martisj: hehe, we all get better over time. This is it working with the dynamic element: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/6Mpre/11/
[20:36:23] <jphase> martisj: funny thing is... as soon as I copy the .autocomplete from the function, and add it to the call at the bottom of the page, it breaks lol
[20:36:29] <jphase> like... first one works, appended ones don't
[20:36:31] <jphase> one or the other
[20:37:02] <jphase> martisj: granted, I haven't really dug through that markup, but I assume that it's the problem cause this is really a fairly rudimentary thing to do with jQuery UI
[20:37:17] <jphase> (hence the first example I gave you in a few lines)
[20:37:35] <willbeeler> hey guys, when i use jsfiddle should i have the document.ready stuff wrapping my code?
[20:37:46] <willbeeler> in the javascript box?
[20:37:52] <jphase> willbeeler: don't need it with the second dropdown on left
[20:38:01] <willbeeler> ok, then this should work: http://jsfiddle.net/hmJYk/
[20:38:02] <jphase> willbeeler: "onDomready" is my method of choice
[20:38:07] <willbeeler> ok
[20:38:09] <willbeeler> check it out
[20:38:20] <martisj> jphase: i know absolutely retarded right!
[20:38:20] <jphase> k
[20:38:23] <jphase> martisj: yes
[20:38:30] <willbeeler> when i click on a particular button, the div.img_holder should show up with my image
[20:38:31] <jphase> willbeeler: what's the problem again? sorry, just catching up
[20:38:33] * martisj goes to kick some markup ass!!
[20:38:36] <jphase> k
[20:38:40] <willbeeler> jphase: read above your comment
[20:38:45] <jphase> yep
[20:38:54] <willbeeler> BUT
[20:39:03] <willbeeler> just next tot he button you clicked, not next to all three
[20:39:14] <jphase> willbeeler: may I rework this into a jQuery DOM object for you? instead of the string approach?
[20:39:20] <willbeeler> i can make it come up next to all three, but.. that's not the intended idea
[20:39:24] <willbeeler> sure
[20:39:26] * jphase doesn't like to step on syntax toes ;)
[20:39:56] <willbeeler> oh yeah, sorry, this is in wordpress, that's why the jQuery instead of $
[20:40:11] <willbeeler> but when i was meddling on my dev server, i put in the $ outside of wp
[20:40:12] <willbeeler> nevermind
[20:40:14] <willbeeler> long story
[20:40:49] <willbeeler> is this the problem?? img_show_div = jQuery(this).prev("div.img_holder");
[20:40:56] <willbeeler> i seem to think so, but i dont know how to solve it
[20:44:44] <martisj> what is the difference between jQuery.currentTarget and jQuery.target/
[20:45:46] <willbeeler> are you asking me?
[20:49:33] <jphase> willbeeler: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/hmJYk/1/
[20:50:31] <jphase> martisj: .target is the thing that triggers the event
[20:50:53] <martisj> i'll just use $(this)
[20:50:58] <martisj> which is what i'm after anyway
[20:52:18] <willbeeler> @jphase: you rock man
[20:52:22] <jphase> ;)
[20:52:29] <willbeeler> can you tell me where the "some_value" is going/
[20:52:31] <willbeeler> ?
[20:53:00] <jphase> willbeeler: goes to .img_holder
[20:53:12] <willbeeler> ok
[20:53:17] <jphase> willbeeler: so it's confusing at first when you start chaining like this, but once you do it, you'll LOVE it
[20:53:18] <jphase> ;)
[20:53:18] <willbeeler> one other thing
[20:53:23] <jphase> yeah?
[20:53:29] <willbeeler> ok ill look into that and do that
[20:54:01] <willbeeler> hold on, im thining
[20:54:05] <willbeeler> thinking*
[20:54:14] <willbeeler> im going to try this out for a sec, and ill brb
[20:54:18] <jphase> oh, I left that console.log in there, muh bad :x
[20:54:22] <jphase> k
[20:55:37] <willbeeler> no worries
[20:56:25] <willbeeler> hold on, my kid just woke up, brb
[20:56:28] <martisj> How can i take in a function as a parameter and use that to call a function after an ajax call has completed?
[20:56:47] <jphase> martisj: just pass it yo ;[
[20:56:50] <jphase> ;]*
[20:57:13] <jphase> you can set as var first if you prefer, but you *could* just pass it in the function call
[20:57:34] <martisj> so i'm calling process_vote($this, 'up', 'answer', function() { //do some shit});
[20:58:06] <martisj> and in the function process_vote(element, action, type, callback){ // call callback ??? }
[20:58:08] <martisj> what do i do there?
[20:58:51] <martisj> in process_vote i do an ajax call. I want to run the callback (i.e. enable a button again) after the ajax call has complete'd
[20:59:30] <shoky> martisj:  callback();  would do it
[21:00:06] <martisj> shoky: i see thanks :)
[21:00:44] <martisj> if i want to add the same event listener back  to $(this)
[21:00:53] <martisj> from inside the anon function how would i do that?
[21:00:58] <martisj> do i have to make a named function first?
[21:01:05] <martisj> $('#posting').one('click', '.up, .down, .qup, .qdown', function (e){
[21:01:14] <martisj> that is the event handler clal
[21:01:26] <shoky> what do you mean, add the same event listener back?
[21:01:41] <martisj> after ajax is complete, I want to enable the one event listener again.
[21:01:48] <shoky> oh using .one
[21:03:02] <shoky> if you really wanna do it that way.. you can put the event handling call ( the .one(....) )   inside a function and call it from inside
[21:03:26] <martisj> shoky: how else should i do it
[21:03:27] <martisj> ?
[21:03:39] <martisj> i want to process the vote before i can do anything with the button again.
[21:03:59] <shoky> one way would be to disable the buttons until the ajax finishes
[21:04:09] <shoky> (and use .on instead of .one)
[21:04:36] <martisj> aha :)
[21:04:38] <martisj> that makes sense
[21:06:27] <martisj> shoky: how do you disable links then?
[21:06:34] <martisj> set disabled=disabled?
[21:14:21] <shoky> martisj: you can't disable links.. you can keep boolean flags (maybe in the link's .data() )  that say whether they are disabled or not
[21:14:45] <shoky> and check the flag(s) in the event handler
[21:14:46] <martisj> shoky: ok I see :)
[21:14:46] <martisj> thanks
[21:16:16] <timbozeman> How can I animate back to height: auto? I tried storing the height before I  made it small but that didn't work. waaay to big
[21:18:32] <martisj> timbozeman: you can't do that.
[21:18:38] <martisj> have to store it first
[21:19:44] <martisj> console.log the height to see why it's too big.
[21:19:48] <martisj> what does the height return
[21:19:55] <martisj> and what method are you using to retrieve the height
[21:20:03] <martisj> the calculated height is tricku
[21:20:20] <timbozeman> i shall see I tried to do  var height1 = $('#edit-tab-2 .fieldset-wrapper').height();
[21:22:58] <timbozeman> ok nm I see the problem. there's more fieldset-wrappers than i though. /me gets coffee
[21:23:01] <timbozeman> thanks again martisj
[21:32:43] <nardev> i have this array object (i hope it's fine) how can i easily select value under 2. and msg3?
[21:34:00] <nardev> i have this array object http://paste.debian.net/55721/ (i hope it's fine) how can i easily select value under 2. and msg3?
[21:38:38] <jphase> nardev: data[2].msg3
[21:41:41] <glaksmono> hello
[21:41:46] <glaksmono> if for example i added this: $(page).find('.drag').draggable({
[21:41:50] <glaksmono> how can i remove it later ?
[21:42:12] <glaksmono> i'm using this plugin: http://ququplay.github.io/zepto.dragdrop.js/
[21:42:13] <glaksmono> anyone?
[21:45:29] <nardev> jphase, thnx
[21:45:35] <jphase> np
[21:46:11] <nardev>  jphase there is another problem :( i get msg3 by selecting it with this $(this.id)
[21:47:13] <jphase> glaksmono: hmm, I think that depends on what zepto offers on their draggable method. with jQuery UI you can do things like $(page).find('.drag').draggable('disable');   Not sure if that one lets you do that though :\
[21:52:56] <nardev> jphase, could you please look at this one http://paste.debian.net/55733/
[21:53:55] <nardev> i need to select from the data object, the one which has key same as id in clicked element.. just getting the data i need, rest works ok..
[21:55:29] <jphase> nardev: change data.[2].this.id   to   data[2][$(this).id]
[21:55:44] <jphase> if that doesn't work, $(this).attr('id')
[21:57:40] <nardev> jphase, thank you
[21:57:41] <nardev> :D
[21:57:47] <jphase> np
[22:49:04] <timmadmodeerf> Does anyone know how I can block a website by domain? The hostsfile method will only block specifically what you type, but I want to block everything that ends in facebook.com for example.  Is there a wildcard method that can somehow be used?
[23:00:42] <thinced> timmadmodeerf: This is kinda wrong place to ask such a question. But anyways. You cannot do that using hosts file. You need something more prowerful. iptables. Please referrer good tutorial at http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-iptables-examples.html. Actually there are facebook example that suits for you out of the box
[23:05:54] <martisj> fark
[23:18:48] <nisseni> I'm having a problem with a flickering hover: http://jsfiddle.net/Tp7YC/
[23:19:14] <nisseni> the flickering is happening when the cursor is moved into a new element, is there a quickfix for this?
[23:34:10] <martisj> anybody seen this before ? element.tooltip().mouseover();  and then the webkit debugger breaks and says Paused on exception: TypeError
[23:34:13] <martisj> What does that mean?
[23:34:38] <Cork> martisj: what is the error for the type error?
[23:35:08] <martisj> Cork: Object #<d> has no method 'mouseove
[23:35:10] <martisj> Cork: Object #<d> has no method 'mouseover
[23:35:33] <Cork> martisj: sounds like element is a dom element and not a jquery object
[23:35:37] <Cork> $(element)
[23:36:10] <martisj> ah right
[23:36:13] <martisj> that could be.
[23:37:14] <nisseni> Cork: did you see/reflect my fiddle?
[23:38:17] <Cork> nisseni: don't see any flickering here
[23:39:05] <nisseni> Cork: try moving in and out of the "main image"
[23:39:26] <nisseni> and you'll notice that each time you enter an inside element, it flickers
[23:39:44] <Cork> nisseni: ah you mean the fade?
[23:39:56] <nisseni> Cork: yeah, it fades in and out in an instant
[23:40:04] <nisseni> like it is leaving / entering the element
[23:41:54] <Cork> nisseni: http://jsfiddle.net/Tp7YC/1/
[23:42:44] <Cork> alternatively i would go with animate instead of fade
[23:42:53] <nisseni> Cork: same thing happens tho
[23:43:06] <nisseni> fades out and in when moving over an inside element
[23:44:35] <Cork> nisseni: another alternative http://jsfiddle.net/Tp7YC/2/
[23:48:53] <nisseni> Cork: bah, didn't work at all when using the code live, works on fiddle
