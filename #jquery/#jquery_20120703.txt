[00:03:35] <coldhead> speyburn: this doesn't seem to work but you see the approach http://jsfiddle.net/FyL87/4/
[00:03:40] <coldhead> nested $.each()s
[00:03:44] <coldhead> one for each entry
[00:03:50] <coldhead> and then one for each field within each entry
[00:07:04] <coldhead> speyburn: http://jsfiddle.net/FyL87/5/
[00:07:07] <coldhead> that works better
[00:07:09] <coldhead> but...
[00:07:16] <coldhead> it would be better to fix your data
[00:07:25] <coldhead> because at the moment you have empty arrays
[00:07:39] <coldhead> and the data is stored in properties of the empty arrays
[00:07:49] <coldhead> i don't see where the weirdness is occurring
[00:08:09] <blackspotwiggins> good morning coldhead
[00:08:15] <coldhead> hey blackspotwiggins !
[00:08:37] <speyburn> coldhead: okay :/ i tried to make it bit better earlier but i couldnt see it either
[00:09:12] <speyburn> but thanks anyway :) this is great already
[00:09:13] <LoneStar99> anyway to replace the class of an element?
[00:09:40] <blackspotwiggins> LoneStar99, .removeClass("oldclass").addClass("newclass")
[00:10:17] <LoneStar99> hmm... ok for some reason that is what i am using but not working. let me try again
[00:10:29] <blackspotwiggins> probably not selecting the correct element
[00:11:30] <LoneStar99> yeah think so
[00:22:12] <LoneStar99> blackspotwiggins:  in the following code want to addClass to second or inside div... -> http://jsfiddle.net/hwdy/Emk78/6/
[00:24:03] <blackspotwiggins> LoneStar99, #foo doesnt have those classes
[00:24:36] <blackspotwiggins> LoneStar99, http://jsfiddle.net/Emk78/7/
[00:25:59] <LoneStar99> blackspotwiggins: ok thanks need to compare lol
[00:26:49] <LoneStar99> ok got it
[00:31:33] <LoneStar99> blackspotwiggins: what about in this code -->  http://jsfiddle.net/hwdy/Emk78/9/
[00:33:17] <blackspotwiggins> loffe,
[00:33:19] <blackspotwiggins> err sry
[00:33:21] <blackspotwiggins> LoneStar99,
[00:33:23] <LoneStar99> blackspotwiggins:  nevermind, i think i git ut
[00:33:25] <blackspotwiggins> #foo has no classes
[00:33:26] <blackspotwiggins> ffs
[00:51:05] <Guest85773> guys  jquery.change() event gets fired only when mouseout ,  that is a real pain . how to fix this !
[00:52:19] <blackspotwiggins> Guest85773, i dont think it is. change is usually fired on blur(text fields) or click(radio/checkbox/etc)
[00:52:52] <Guest85773> mine is a textarea
[00:53:09] <Guest85773> and i cannot employ keypress or keyup
[00:53:20] <Guest85773> because of my unicode writer
[00:53:20] <blackspotwiggins> you type with a mouse?
[00:53:52] <Guest85773> sometimes yes
[00:53:58] <Guest36616> how to start with jQuery?i could't able to start with this jQuery
[00:54:16] <Guest85773> but most of the time textarea won't detect the keyup event because of the unicode writer ibus
[00:54:32] <blackspotwiggins> do you have an example for that?
[00:55:17] <Guest85773> yes
[00:55:21] <Guest85773> let me pastie it
[00:56:29] <Guest85773> http://pastie.org/4191704
[00:56:32] <Guest85773> here it is :D
[00:57:22] <blackspotwiggins> yea change only works when you focus out
[00:57:40] <fRAiLtY-> Morning, I need some help with a debug, Can anyone advise of ANY js errors here: http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing with the following combination 1) Wide Boy 2) 25 3) 300gsm Gloss 4) 5 Working Days, you'll notice a price (£24.70) appears then as soon as the additional options appear (multi-select) it zero's the price, can anyone spot a js error there?
[01:00:31] <Guest85773> blackspotwiggins ,  i want the script to work without focusing out manually .  its where i am stuck
[01:00:44] <blackspotwiggins> Guest23349, it works fine for me on ibus
[01:00:46] <blackspotwiggins> ehh
[01:00:50] <blackspotwiggins> Guest85773, i meant
[01:01:05] <blackspotwiggins> keydown and keyup
[01:01:09] <blackspotwiggins> no keypress tho
[01:01:25] <Guest85773> can't use them , because of ibus unicode converter
[01:01:49] <Guest85773> when ibus writes to the textarea , textarea won't detect the keydown or keyup events
[01:01:57] <Guest85773> so only change() is practical
[01:01:59] <blackspotwiggins> Guest85773, i jut tried it
[01:02:01] <blackspotwiggins> it does work
[01:02:22] <Guest85773> i am on ubuntu and it does not work for me :(
[01:02:32] <Guest85773> i have the latest firefox installed

I have followed this tutorial http://www.html5trends.com/tutorials/simple-and-short-jquery-fixed-floating-scrollbar-technique/ to make the sidebar here http://bibouille.net/?category/Sortir follow the page scroll , any idea why ? Is it because the sidebar div is in the content div ?
[01:33:17] <dubphil> yes I have forget to mention that it is not working
[01:33:45] <jastor> dubphil: ... whats wrong with just using position: fixed instead of using jquery to make a div follow scroll?
[01:36:50] <dubphil> jastor: I would be happy to use just this, but why some peoples codes scripts to do this then ?
[01:37:02] <_jastor> dubphil: no idea

[02:29:42] <tuim> hello
[02:30:03] <tuim> i have a very long document and document.ready() should only fire, when it's completely loaded, right?
[02:30:16] <tuim> but it does fire before
[02:30:38] <tuim> the cursor is still an hourglass when it get's fired
[02:30:41] <tuim> what can i do here?
[02:30:49] <Cork> Grundell: you mean remove everything?
[02:31:17] <Cork> tuim: no, its triggered when the html is completly loaded
[02:31:27] <Cork> tuim: .load is triggered when images is loaded
[02:31:34] <Cork> s/is/are/
[02:31:40] <tuim> okay, thank you ;)
[02:32:13] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: looks like price and oldPrice are parsed to NaN because pair.value isn't what you think it is?
[02:32:33] <fRAiLtY-> seutje:  Wow, how'd you find that out?
[02:32:38] <fRAiLtY-> My JS console shows nothing :x
[02:32:47] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: breakoint
[02:32:53] <seutje> steppin through
[02:32:55] <Grundell> Cork - i want to remove class names and style names from the HTML code
[02:33:07] <Cork> Grundell: so just specific rules?
[02:33:17] <Grundell> yes
[02:33:35] <Cork> Grundell: you can't remove specific css rules with jquery, just "reset" them to the default
[02:33:38] <Grundell> http://pastebin.com/jv78mtqn
[02:33:41] <fRAiLtY-> ?NaN
[02:33:45] <Grundell> thats the code....
[02:33:46] <Cork> Grundell: classes is removed with .removeClass
[02:33:55] <fRAiLtY-> `NaN
[02:33:58] <fRAiLtY-> hmm
[02:34:16] <Grundell> I need to remove the class from the getElementByID
[02:34:40] <Cork> Grundell: you mean #txtHint ?
[02:34:49] <Grundell> ues
[02:34:53] <Cork> or #translations?
[02:35:43] <Grundell> 2 sec let me se which one is the active
[02:35:48] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: it seems to loop through the price calculation thing twice for every change
[02:36:33] <Grundell> So i need to remove all classes and style tags from within #translations
[02:36:43] <fRAiLtY-> seutje:  The 4 drop-downs all work perfectly, it's when using that combination, the 4th drop down is selected it triggers a function which I have here to load the custom options multi-select. Once this custom options multi-select appears on screen it zero's the price :x
[02:36:46] <Grundell> sorry classes and Id's
[02:36:49] <seutje> the first pass seems to work fine, but on the second pass it seems that optionPrices isn't returning anything
[02:37:06] <Cork> Grundell: $('#translations').removeClass('').removeAttr('style')
[02:37:11] <Cork> thats the best you can do
[02:37:17] <Grundell> okay
[02:37:23] <seutje> fRAiLtY-: can't rly tell you anything more right now
[02:37:28] <seutje> gotta go eat, you see :D
[02:37:42] <Cork> Grundell: let me dubble check the removeClass syntax though, i'm not sure i got that one right
[02:37:53] <Grundell> Ok
[02:38:07] <Cork> yup
[02:38:15] <Cork> removeClass() is the correct syntax
[02:38:17] <mattyh88> why doesn't this do the alert thing onLoad? http://jsfiddle.net/GWETY/
[02:38:31] <Cork> Grundell: add a string if you want to remove specific class names
[02:38:39] <Cork> Grundell: space separated
[02:38:42] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[02:38:59] <Grundell> Oh tanks :)
[02:39:23] <Cork> mattyh88: cause it waits for onchange events?
[02:39:34] <mattyh88> Cork: i triggered the change event? :)
[02:39:47] <mattyh88> Cork: $('#sarf_filters_search_topic_id').val(7).change();
[02:39:58] <Cork> mattyh88:  before you bind the listner ya
[02:40:05] <mattyh88> oh right haha
[02:40:06] <Grundell> Cork is there a possibility to remove id's also ?
[02:40:07] <mattyh88> dumb
[02:40:19] <Cork> Grundell: sure removeAttr('id')
[02:40:26] <Grundell> sweet
[02:43:07] <Grundell> Cork- hmm i use that code to get a the html markup to save to the DB. Seams like it doesn't want to save when i have $removeClass
[02:45:57] <Grundell> Or, i wrote it wrong i can see now but it doesn't remove any classes or any style
[02:46:17] <Cork> if so then your selector doesn't work
[02:46:35] <Cork> or are you trying to run on an html string?
[02:48:45] <Grundell> Cork - what im trying to achive is to select the html code within trans to copy so i can save it to the DB
[02:50:22] <Cork> var clone = $('#translations').clone(); clone.find('#id-to-remove').removeAttr('id'); clone.find('.class-to-remove').removeClass('class-to-remove'); ... var db_store = clone.html()
[02:50:49] <Cork> or if you just want to remove all id's thats simple too
[02:52:52] <Grundell> okay
[02:53:39] <Grundell>  Cork - the thing is that i really really am a novice in jQuerry, and this code was written for me...
[02:54:00] <Grundell> So i don't really know how it works in essence...
[02:54:33] <Cork> Grundell: then you need to look into it before you start hacking at it
[02:54:49] <Grundell> Yes
[02:55:33] <GreekFreak> hi all.
[02:56:39] <GreekFreak> When I add functions to a JS file (using Rails) it is all wrapped in a "(function() {});" in that file. Is that the same as the jQuery(function() {}); which is also the same as the $(document).ready(function() {});  ?
[02:57:17] <Cork> GreekFreak: no
[02:57:31] <Cork> thats called a scope, its also known as a namespace
[02:58:02] <Cork> code declared inside a self executing function isn't visible to the rest of the page
[02:58:23] <GreekFreak> Cork, so I'd still have to add jQuery(fucntion() {}) before my functions inside that scope?
[02:58:31] <Cork> yes
[02:58:51] <GreekFreak> And jQuery(function() {}); is indeed the same as $(document).ready(function() {});  ?
[02:58:57] <Cork> yes
[02:59:03] <GreekFreak> Cork, thank you
[02:59:22] <Cork> $(function() {}); jQuery(function() {}); $(document).ready(function() {}); are all the same thing
[02:59:54] <GreekFreak> Cork, I thought they were, I just wanted to confirm, cause some ppl used the one and others the other
[03:00:20] <Grundell> Cork - sorry to ask but exactly where am i supposed to put the remove class ?
[03:00:35] <Cork> Grundell: depends on your code
[03:01:03] <GreekFreak> Cork, thanks again
[03:01:11] <Cork> np
[03:01:15] <Grundell> Cork - okay, do you think you could help me in that case ?

[04:12:22] <Ricaz> I have problem with an ajax call. When I get a php page with a query in it, the query won't work. Also, the encoding screws up, I think. Displays questionmarks instead of special characters (æøå).
[04:12:30] <nFFF> Grundell I dont see any javascript?
[04:13:00] <Grundell> nFFF - ah shit did I forget it ?
[04:14:10] <arian> kentaromiura, yo
[04:14:12] <kentaromiura> hey arian!
[04:14:28] <kentaromiura> what a mootooler like you is doing here?
[04:14:37] <seutje> spying
[04:14:41] <kentaromiura> lol
[04:14:47] <seutje> you colaborateur, you
[04:14:52] <arian> looking what you're doing, kentaromiura
[04:14:56] <kentaromiura> :O
[04:15:00] <seutje> now the secret's out
[04:15:22] <roly> guys im having some .val() problems, using the following JSF, http://jsfiddle.net/quxPF/ when you click one of the green boxes i want the corresponding select value to change
[04:15:28] <seutje> we know why you're here, don't expect us to give it up without a fight
[04:15:34] <Grundell> nFFF - https://tinker.io/6dd6a/1 that is how far i made it
[04:15:35] <Grundell> ...
[04:16:55] <seutje> roly: stop wrapping jQuery objects in a jQuery object
[04:17:11] <roly> its magento development so you pretty much have to
[04:17:35] <seutje> that makes no sense
[04:17:37] <Grundell> nFFF - would assume i should use pageLoad instead of ready ?
[04:17:58] <seutje> anyway, roly: you are setting the .html on the wrapper and then you try to find the children
[04:18:10] <xec> Ricaz: we need (a lot) more detail and preferably a live site to look at in order to be able to help you. what works, what does not, and what does your code look like?
[04:18:10] <seutje> roly: obviously there are non, aside from the textNode you just set it to
[04:18:17] <seutje> none*
[04:18:22] <fRAiLtY-> seutje:  Progress from earlier, however price now doesn't update on change as it's supposed to http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing with the following combination 1) Wide Boy 2) 25 3) 300gsm Gloss 4) 5 Working Days, you'll notice some further options appear, when you click these it should update the price accordingly with on change, but ithe price is staying static :X
[04:18:27] <Zhy> Grundell http://jsfiddle.net/VQ9zF/12/ ?
[04:18:28] <Ricaz> xec live site: http://klinik-m.dk/
[04:18:39] <Zhy> if you only want to remove everything - that should do
[04:18:42] <seutje> roly: http://jsfiddle.net/quxPF/1/
[04:18:56] <seutje> roly: clicked is already a jQuery object, don't wrap it in jQuery()
[04:19:14] <Ricaz> xec I basically did an $.ajax with url and a success function.. the .php file it includes has a bunch of text and a mysql_query().
[04:19:54] <roly> ahh seutje thank you so much
[04:20:01] <roly> been fiddling with this for ages and it was so simple
[04:20:03] <uamm> why does my code print the substring firstcontent twice? http://jsfiddle.net/mh3nZ/
[04:20:03] <Ricaz> unstable connection -.-
[04:20:32] <seutje> roly: basically, when you asplode a value on line 1, it'll still be asploded on line 2 :P
[04:20:43] <Grundell> Zhy - is this one general for all classes in html doc? because i need it to be for just the  ( holder) http://jsfiddle.net/VQ9zF/13/
[04:20:55] <seutje> so $foo.html('lol'); $foo.children(); // 0 children returned
[04:21:04] <seutje> no matter what it used to contain
[04:21:07] <uamm> oh nvm, used eq(0)
[04:21:08] <xec> Ricaz: the error is not apparent to me, what is wrong?
[04:21:19] <xec> Ricaz: i see a mysql error?
[04:21:45] <seutje> it help if mySQL is on
[04:21:48] <seutje> helps*
[04:21:54] <seutje> or at least, that's what I was told
[04:21:56] <Ricaz> xec yes, everything below the image is on a seperate page called with ajax. if I remove the ajax call and just put everything on one page, it works
[04:22:18] <Zhy> '*' would be for _everything_ afaik, Grundell - what do you mean with holder?
[04:22:27] <roly> well seutje for some reason when i was learning magento development the guy i was working for told me that i had to encase everyting in jQuery() objects
[04:22:33] <roly> i'll take your advice because well
[04:22:38] <roly> he turned out to be a bit of an idiot
[04:22:44] <xec> Ricaz: well, i see content beneath the image here, the content from the ajax call is inserted into the <section>
[04:22:45] <Grundell> Zhy -  I added a div around it that i called holder...
[04:22:47] <seutje> Ricaz: http://klinik-m.dk/includes/about.php always gives me a mySQL error, saying it isn't turned on
[04:23:05] <Zhy> ah sorry, didn't see ^^
[04:23:11] <seutje> (or the socket location is misconfigured)
[04:23:13] <Grundell> Zhy - i just want it to remove classes attributes within that specific holder
[04:23:15] <Ricaz> yes, that is because the db info is included on the index.php page.
[04:23:27] <seutje> roly: that's a serious performance hit iirc
[04:23:44] <Zhy> http://jsfiddle.net/VQ9zF/18/ Grundell
[04:23:45] <Ricaz> I think I get it why it doesn't work now
[04:24:03] <Zhy> just a matter of selectors
[04:24:03] <Grundell> Sweet :)
[04:24:06] <Zhy> :)
[04:24:10] <Grundell> Zhy thanks :)
[04:24:14] <xec> Ricaz: don't keep us in suspense!
[04:24:16] <Zhy> np ^^
[04:24:36] <seutje> Ricaz: PHP doesn't know you want to include index unless you specifically tell it to
[04:25:01] <Grundell> Zhy - BTW is that on page load or after page has loaded ?
[04:25:20] <jarr0dsz> hey guys
[04:25:36] <jarr0dsz> would it be possible to have a model window and upon click event close it + reload the "mother page" ?
[04:25:44] <Ricaz> well, the database info is included on the index.php, everything is loaded and then the ajax call inserts the other page with a query. But this query doesn't know the database info
[04:25:45] <jarr0dsz> i need to redirect the parent page upon modal.close event
[04:26:08] <seutje> Ricaz: exactly, and I wouldn't advise you to send that info in your ajax call
[04:26:23] <Ricaz> erh
[04:26:24] <ruby_on_tails> how can i trigger .load on an image ?
[04:26:25] <Zhy> $(document).ready should be when the page has loaded everything, Grundell, if you're using ajax you could put the attribute removal in a function and call that on ajaxComplete
[04:26:40] <xec> Ricaz: the mysql call is serverside, you'll need to do that in the php file you call
[04:26:49] <ruby_on_tails> $(".small").load(); this doesnt work
[04:26:52] <Grundell> Zhy - okay I'm not using ajax so this will do...
[04:26:53] <xec> s/call/request
[04:26:55] <ruby_on_tails> .small is the class of the image
[04:27:00] <Ricaz> seutje so I shouldn't do a query in a file that's going through ajax?
[04:27:05] <seutje> ruby_on_tails: did you try imagesloaded?
[04:27:26] <seutje> Ricaz: sure, but don't send the raw DB credentials over the wire
[04:27:31] <Ricaz> if I just include the db info on that page as well, it should work, right?
[04:27:36] <Ricaz> or is it a security issue?
[04:27:42] <ruby_on_tails> seutje: i dont want to use that plugin
[04:27:42] <seutje> depends how
[04:27:54] <seutje> ruby_on_tails: is there a reason?
[04:28:12] <ruby_on_tails> seutje: i am coding on a pastebin kind of thing, wouldnt like to use a plugin
[04:28:28] <seutje> ruby_on_tails: so you're essentially gonna rewrite the thing?
[04:28:28] <ruby_on_tails> seutje: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2580231/jquery-how-can-i-place-triggers-on-images-already-cached this doesnt work
[04:28:39] <xec> ruby_on_tails: have you tried .trigger() ?
[04:28:47] <seutje> april 2010, not surprised
[04:28:48] <ruby_on_tails> xec: yes that too doesnt work for some reason
[04:28:50] <ruby_on_tails> i am on FF
[04:29:07] <ruby_on_tails> maybe some quick fixes are available after the development of that plugin
[04:29:22] <Zhy> Grundell this one would be even cleaner: http://jsfiddle.net/VQ9zF/21/ it removes the attribute tags from the objects. If you inspect for example the div with my first solution, you'd still have an id and class tag (which are empty) - removeAttr removes even those :)
[04:29:28] <ruby_on_tails> http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/magnifying-glass-for-images-using-jquery-and-css3 this thing is not working on ff, and i cant really include a plugin there
[04:29:39] <uamm> How can I put a slide and fade in at the same time on this? $('#page-wrap p:eq(0)').hide().html(secondcontent).fadeIn('slow');
[04:30:06] <Ricaz> seutje but in which order does it get executed? if I do include(db.php); on the page getting called, will that be executed after the ajax call (meaning it will all be transfered through the call)?
[04:30:07] <seutje> not sure how a 2 year old plugin that runs on 1.4.2 has anything to do with a plugin that almost went into core jQuery, but alright
[04:30:55] <ruby_on_tails> i would have used the plugin if it was a normal project
[04:31:01] <ruby_on_tails> i cant really do that here
[04:31:06] <seutje> also, whatever you do, don't look at the plugin for inspiration
[04:31:26] <seutje> you would risk finding a solution without reinventing it
[04:31:29] <ruby_on_tails> i dont do that, i am not that good to read others code and inspire
[04:31:49] <seutje> best of luck in this business then
[04:31:51] <xec> Ricaz: ajax is nothing magic, it's just a regular http request, only it's done by javascript rather than a manual page refresh
[04:32:17] <ruby_on_tails> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3877027/jquery-callback-on-image-load-even-when-the-image-is-cached 39 upvotes for this answer, but doesnt work on my FF
[04:32:18] <ruby_on_tails> weird
[04:32:20] <xec> Ricaz: so treat your about.php page like a separate normal web page request
[04:32:36] <arian> kentaromiura, ttyl in #mootools ;)
[04:32:37] <seutje> Ricaz: I don't really know what's in the php file, for all I know it just says print($dbCredentialsLolSecurityIsForPussies);
[04:32:40] <Grundell> Zhy - That one would be a lot better, thoiugh it doesnt
[04:32:47] <ruby_on_tails> umm, let me retry this solution
[04:32:48] <Grundell> want to work on my page
[04:32:52] <Ricaz> xec right, but then there would be no security issue
[04:33:14] <Ricaz> even if the php page getting called has variables like username/pw
[04:33:29] <xec> Ricaz: define "variables" in this case
[04:33:33] <Zhy> Grundell, it doesn't work or what do you mean?
[04:33:44] <Ricaz> $username = xxx
[04:33:52] <xec> Ricaz: inside the php file? fine
[04:33:57] <Grundell> Zhy - yes, i get the first one you wrote to work but that one doesn't
[04:33:57] <ruby_on_tails> it jst doesnt work
[04:34:05] <ruby_on_tails> how the hell did it work for so many people
[04:34:15] <Ricaz> how else would I define the db settings? :p
[04:34:59] <Grundell> Zhy - that's pretty wiered...
[04:35:06] <xec> Ricaz: some people think it's a good idea to pass credentials with the http request, like $.ajax("about.php?username=blabla&pwd=supersafe")
[04:35:16] <Zhy> Hmm damn :/ and you don't get any errors? try the second one with only one attribute, for example removeAttr('class');
[04:35:20] <xec> Ricaz: that's what seutje was warning you about
[04:35:24] <xec> i believe..
[04:35:27] <Ricaz> xec :O
[04:37:06] <Ricaz> well it works now after I included the db info in that page as well, thank you :)
[04:37:33] <seutje> gogo fiddle gooooo
[04:38:30] <Grundell> Or maybe it's easier to do a replace....  (got a guy to gode an app for me but he couldn't make it from ajax / java / backbone to be able to save the content by array to DB  so i decided to getElementById) though i still want to have the Html markup ....
[04:38:55] <Grundell> / Zhy
[04:40:29] <Zhy> Grundell replace what with what exactly ?
[04:40:36] <ruby_on_tails> seutje: i removed .load lol
[04:40:38] <Grundell> Hang on...
[04:40:45] <Grundell> (// Zhy)
[04:43:15] <jeffsmykil> Best canvas library, ready, set, go!
[04:43:22] <seutje> ruby_on_tails: was about to say, this works fine in my foxies
[04:43:39] <ruby_on_tails> seutje: does the magnifying glass appear ? if the image is loaded from cache ?
[04:43:46] <seutje> wait what?
[04:43:59] <ruby_on_tails> hover on the phone image
[04:44:06] <seutje> I was just trying the complete thing on random images
[04:44:10] <seutje> what phone image?
[04:44:17] <seutje> WHAT'S GOING ON???!!
[04:44:28] <ruby_on_tails> what works fine on your foxies ?
[04:44:57] <seutje> the thing with 39 upvotes you said doesn't work
[04:45:43] <ruby_on_tails> seutje: does it work fine with images loading from cache ?
[04:45:44] <Deele> could anyone suggest any ajax upload script that works reliably? the one from phplatter.com stopped functioning giving errorcode 4 to my php server...
[04:45:47] <ruby_on_tails> doesnt seem to work here
[04:46:16] <blackspotwiggins> Deele, formdata+xhr2 work wonderfully
[04:47:40] <seutje> ruby_on_tails: yup, works fine
[04:48:03] <ruby_on_tails> seutje: hmm, weird, doesnt work for me, maybe the code of the player is causing some issues, i will keep away from .load for now
[04:48:06] <Grundell> Zhy - so this is the actual code that i have. i want to display al the <li> and i want to remove the id's and classes from them.... hide the <div id="stepp-trns"> and remove the class translation-block
[04:48:14] <Grundell> http://jsfiddle.net/JekUU/1/
[04:48:17] <Grundell> / Zhy
[04:49:32] <Grundell> Zhy - thought the best way would be to remove all classes and id's and then go with the .trans-single css
[04:50:39] <Deele> blackspotwiggins could you give some sort of example?
[04:50:56] <seutje> Grundell: http://jsfiddle.net/JekUU/4/ ?
[04:52:08] <Grundell> seutje - thanks :)=
[04:52:21] <seutje> negative top margin on those spans makes it look funky though
[04:52:33] <Zhy> Like so, Grundell? http://jsfiddle.net/JekUU/6/
[04:52:56] <seutje> why u gotta specify element and ID?
[04:53:10] <seutje> div#stepp-trns <- why? :(
[04:53:30] <Grundell> sejute - yes i know that was the css i had earlier need to change that : P
[04:54:14] <seutje> Zhy: that class matching is a bit overly-strict as well, innit?
[04:54:24] <Zhy> seutje is that bad performance-wise ?
[04:54:28] <seutje> yea
[04:54:31] <Zhy> I was just doing what Grundell was asking for :)
[04:54:38] <Zhy> so only id selector?
[04:54:50] <Zhy> (or at least I think that's what was asked for :0 )
[04:54:54] <Grundell> sejute - well i have this guy that made an translation app for me,m though he wasn't smart enough to make it possible for me to save the data to db... and since im a real rockie when it comes to javascript / jQuerry i didn't know how to solve the problem, so what i did was that i wen with getElementById to save to the DB
[04:54:57] <seutje> element#id causes jQuery to not just use document.querySelector afaik
[04:54:58] <jeffsmykil> wtf does context mean in fabric.util.http://fabricjs.com/docs/symbols/fabric.util.html#.loadImage(url, callback, context)
[04:55:11] <seutje> eeer getElementById, right
[04:55:13] <Zhy> kk thanks seutje
[04:55:37] <Grundell> Zhy - i know :) the thing is that the li's are display none...
[04:55:39] <jeffsmykil> is context the name of what it is passing to the clalback?
[04:55:51] <seutje> Grundell: nothing wrong with  getElementById
[04:56:20] <Zhy> Grundell then remove that style too (removeAttr('class id style') or set it to block or something
[04:56:26] <seutje> well you could just go all document.getElementsByTagName('li'); and then iterate over them, removing the style attribute
[04:56:38] <Zhy> the formatting is a bit off then, though
[04:56:54] <Grundell> seutje - no but i got al the html markup with it so i need to remove it in order to display it on another page
[04:56:54] <Zhy> http://jsfiddle.net/JekUU/9/
[04:57:07] <seutje> Zhy: yea, guess that would be cheaper than my .show() call
[04:57:32] <seutje> Grundell: yea, I'm just saying, there's no shame is doing stuff in vanilla JS
[04:58:29] * Zhy must be blind
[04:58:35] <Zhy> where is your show() call, seutje ? :D
[04:58:40] <Zhy> show me dat!
[04:59:07] <jeffsmykil> bad documentation is bad
[04:59:46] <Grundell> seutje - Thanks :)
[04:59:51] <seutje> Zhy: http://jsfiddle.net/JekUU/4/
[05:00:05] <seutje> $('li').show().removeAttr('class id');
[05:00:22] <seutje> I suppose $('li').removeAttr('class id style') would be faster
[05:00:35] <Grundell> seutje / zhy  - do you know if there is a reason why i can't get this scripts to work in WP or am i just lost here
[05:00:52] <seutje> Grundell: jQuery version?
[05:01:04] <Grundell> js/jquery-1.7.2.min.js
[05:01:09] <seutje> oh
[05:01:30] <seutje> did you copy the closure as well?
[05:01:40] <seutje> the (function($){ })(jQuery) wrapper thingy
[05:01:47] <Grundell> everything
[05:01:48] <Zhy> ah your very  first link, didn't see that, seutje , ty :)
[05:01:53] <seutje> odd
[05:02:02] <Grundell> mhm
[05:02:12] <seutje> Grundell: no error or nothing?
[05:03:27] <Grundell> just nothing
[05:04:30] <Grundell> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[05:04:36] <Zhy> oO
[05:04:39] <Grundell> If that has something to do with it ?
[05:10:36] <intkftajq> table=new Array(20); for(i...) table[i]=new Array(30); is table[20][30] correct element of table?
[05:10:44] <intkftajq> err
[05:10:50] <intkftajq> I mean [19][29]
[05:12:03] <silverwind> intkftajq, it's javascript, not C
[05:12:22] <silverwind> ?js var x = []; x[235] = 10;
[05:12:33] <silverwind> Bot is dead...
[05:12:42] <Grundell> zhy / seutje - can it have something to do with that i write the script inside the html =?
[05:13:59] <Zhy> Grundell, I don't know, might be. You could try to put it in an external JS file and include that file, shouldn't be much of a hassle and you'd know whether that's the problem ^^
[05:17:54] <DeltaHeavy> Hey guys, I was wondering if this is the proper way to pre-load images with jQuery: http://pastebin.com/VfEJpeuZ  I'm pretty sure this is working but I just want to be 100% sure
[05:19:02] <silverwind> DeltaHeavy, the each you're using is usually for nodes
[05:19:16] <silverwind> $.each(myArray, function() {}) is the utility function for arrays
[05:19:30] <silverwind> Beside that... looks good
[05:21:13] <DeltaHeavy> So this would be correct: $.each(preloadImages, function() { var loadImage = $('<img />').attr('src', this); });   ?
[05:21:37] <silverwind> Yeah
[05:22:08] <silverwind> You don't really need to declare the loadImage variable since you don't use it
[05:22:21] <Ricaz> Is there a way to prevent links (<a href="#">) from scrolling the page to the top?
[05:22:42] <silverwind> Ricaz, you attach an event handler on it and call e.preventDefault();
[05:22:54] <seutje> Grundell: not really, as long as it's on the page after jQuery
[05:23:16] <silverwind> Ricaz,  $('a').on('click', function(event){ event.preventDefault(); });
[05:23:19] <Grundell> seutje - okay...
[05:23:30] <Ricaz> silverwind cool :)
[05:23:50] <johnkpaul> silverwind: $('a[href=#]') should work
[05:24:06] <silverwind> john-dev, It's an even better idea :D
[05:24:32] <seutje> beware of selectors like that though
[05:24:40] <Grundell> wierd is that the fist code Zhy sent me actually worked... though  this ones aren't
[05:24:45] <seutje> they can be quite costly on some browsers whose name won't be mentioned
[05:24:57] <silverwind> seutje, he can use event delegation then
[05:25:01] <silverwind> A single handler.
[05:25:17] <seutje> yea, sure
[05:26:00] <seutje> just saying, avoid attriute selectors when possible
[05:26:14] <seutje> I just completely my "b"
[05:26:21] <GreekFreak> hi all
[05:26:21] <DeltaHeavy> silverwind: Somebody in #web is saying my method isn't going to work =/ Will it for sure?
[05:26:34] <DeltaHeavy> I'm having a hard time testing if this works and stuff
[05:27:30] <silverwind> DeltaHeavy, I used a similar approach in the past... he always worked, the only difference is that I added a callback that is called once all the images are preloaded.
[05:27:38] <silverwind> *it always
[05:28:09] <Grundell> seutje / zhy so this code works but not the other ones :S  http://pastebin.com/p9WBcU6Y do you have any idea what the problem could be ?
[05:28:43] <silverwind> DeltaHeavy, There a easy way to verify...
[05:29:28] <silverwind> DeltaHeavy, var image = $('<img>'); image.on('load', function() { console.log('preloaded'); }); image.attr('src', thePath); in your loop
[05:29:29] <Grundell> seutje / Zhy --- though i don't the desired result with that code
[05:29:46] <silverwind> DeltaHeavy, If you get anything in your console then it preloaded.
[05:30:49] <Zhy> no clue, Grundell, you could try to google for your uncaught syntaxerror message
[05:31:37] <GreekFreak> In the success part of an ajax call I set a global variable, but because it is async the change is not kept in memory for use later. How can I get around that?
[05:31:53] <uamm> Anyone know a good plugin with collapse/expand fadeSlide effect?
[05:32:00] <Grundell> Zhy - could we alter that code to work ?
[05:33:27] <GreekFreak> I would like to avoid adding "async: false"
[05:34:38] <DeltaHeavy> silverwind: What's 'thePath' in your example?
[05:34:42] <silverwind> GreekFreak, the kind of problem you have is usually a symptom of not understanding how async programming works.. It's would be a bit difficult for us to help you without seeing any of your code.
[05:34:51] <Ricaz> I have another problem with the ajax call.. mostly performance related. So the page loads normally, linking to jquery.js and my script.js. Then, in the script.js i do an ajax call to show content. However I need to use jQuery on the loaded page, but it's not found since it was loaded before.
[05:35:02] <silverwind> DeltaHeavy, in your example, it would be    this
[05:35:19] <Ricaz> So now I include jQuery a second time on the page being called by ajax.. can I get around this?
[05:35:30] <uamm> I need help, please: http://jsfiddle.net/yPHmh/ I cant get a slide & fade effect on this at the same time. Very grateful for help
[05:35:51] <DeltaHeavy> silverwind: If in the 'var loadImage' line i have ".attr('src', 'images/' + this);" would I need to include the "'images/ +" ?
[05:36:02] <uamm> read more/read less effect
[05:36:33] <silverwind> DeltaHeavy, You know better than me how your files are structured on your server :(
[05:36:48] <GreekFreak> silverwind, I basically want to know if the validation passed: https://gist.github.com/3039489
[05:37:30] <DeltaHeavy> silverwind: Ok, was just a little confused on exactly what's going on. Getting a bunch of output of 'preloadedImages' and some 404's for some images so I guess it's working, just need to fix up my array. Thanks
[05:38:14] <silverwind> GreekFreak, You cannot "return" anything from a success handler. Also, are you using ajax to send the form once it's valid?
[05:38:31] <silverwind> DeltaHeavy, wonderful :D
[05:39:42] <GreekFreak> silverwind, I will eventually yes. At the moment I just want to know if it passed, so I can check that variable before "submit"
[05:40:13] <uamm> I need help, please: http://jsfiddle.net/yPHmh/ I cant get a slide & fade effect on this at the same time. I want it to fade and slideDown at the same time.
[05:41:39] <GreekFreak> silverwind, maybe this extra function will help clarify what I'm trying to do: https://gist.github.com/3039489
[05:41:58] <uamm> any ideas?
[05:44:24] <GreekFreak> silverwind, I understand the asynchronous part. I'm trying to find out how one would achieve what I want, without adding async: false in my code
[05:45:21] <silverwind> Not sure if it's possible to do any async validation on a form sent the "classic" way
[05:46:46] <uamm> http://jsfiddle.net/yPHmh/ I cant get a slide & fade effect on this at the same time. Anyone familiar with the plugin or ideas of how to solve it?
[05:47:21] <GreekFreak> silverwind, I'm not doing it the classic way. I validate each field on focusOut. But when the user clicks the send button (not a form), I need to know if all the validations had passed, some of which will be with ajax.
[05:47:24] <Cork> ?.animate @ uamm
[05:47:35] <uamm> Cork I am familiar with .animate
[05:47:41] <uamm> but how to implent it in this solution, nope
[05:49:03] <Cork> uamm: set the opacity to 0 the height to 0
[05:49:12] <Cork> then use animate to slide it like you want
[05:49:52] <uamm> Cork I used the beforeExpand and it worked
[05:49:55] <uamm> with animate
[05:50:31] <silverwind> GreekFreak, I never did it but perhaps you could do it with a global "formIsValid" flag...
[05:51:26] <fuchstronaut> GreekFreak: why dont you just set a class?
[05:52:18] <GreekFreak> silverwind, that didn't work either. However, I had a call to an synchronous class, and I edited the variable in there (since it is a function that is called only on fail) and it worked
[05:52:27] <GreekFreak> fuchstronaut, I didn't think of that... :/
[05:52:47] <fuchstronaut> thats the common case with the straight forward solutions
[05:53:01] <fuchstronaut> you also could set a flag using jquery data() method
[05:54:42] <GreekFreak> fuchstronaut, the class seems like a good idea. And I can have all my input elements starting with that, and I won't rely on them having to have at least made an attempt to enter a field.
[05:54:45] <GreekFreak> fuchstronaut, thanks
[05:55:43] <fuchstronaut> in addition classes give you a way to provide feedback to the user by using css. Just make sure you are validating your input serversides
[05:55:53] <uamm> $('#page-wrap').animate({height:240, opacity:0}, 800, function() { }); however, Cork. What if I only want to fade the div to the height 240px?
[05:56:24] <Cork> uamm: fade to height?
[05:56:28] <Cork> you can't do that
[05:56:41] <Cork> that needs two elements
[05:57:25] <GreekFreak> fuchstronaut, I do. This is for userfriendlyness. thanks again
[05:57:43] <fRAiLtY-> I'm trying to get the value of the select and pass it to my function here, but it doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/MZrSS/49/
[05:57:52] <Nece228> hello
[05:57:59] <fRAiLtY-> new Date requires an integer from the select in nextShipDate()
[05:58:01] <Nece228> how to check if something exists e.g.
[05:58:16] <Nece228> i use now $('foo').length
[05:58:26] <Nece228> but it checks only if its not empty
[05:58:34] <Nece228> but i need to check if it exists at all
[05:58:37] <DeltaHeavy> Is it bad to have a function that creates a bunch of events every time something happens or should I add them all to a class, turn the event off then make a new event with that class?
[05:59:02] <Cork> Nece228: $('foo').length will give you the number of elements that match your query
[05:59:15] <Cork> Nece228: it doesn't care if the element is empty or not
[05:59:43] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: event with class?
[05:59:50] <Cork> your talking about event namespace?
[05:59:58] <Nece228> Cork: then whats the way to check it?
[06:00:09] <Cork> Nece228: check what?
[06:00:22] <Nece228> Cork: if $('foo') exists?
[06:00:28] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: $('.something').click(function() {
[06:00:42] <Cork> if($('#foo').length > 0) { alert('it exists'); }
[06:01:22] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: what cost most is to bind the event listner, so just leave it
[06:01:35] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: though a good way to speed up the page is to use delegated events
[06:02:02] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: theres a section in on about it
[06:02:17] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: This is not the way I have it now. I have a function that assigns each dynamically added element via ID as they're created. This is fine?
[06:02:49] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: if the different elements does the same thing, NO
[06:03:05] <DeltaHeavy> I have a function that inserts dynamic HTML into the page via .append then calls another function that assigns these new elements events.
[06:03:06] <Cork> use a class, and delegate the click listner to a common parent
[06:03:41] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[06:05:12] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Ok I see, if I have it working this way now should I bother changing it?
[06:05:48] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: depends on how many elements you bind
[06:05:56] <Cork> if it like < 15 elements in total, no
[06:06:03] <Cork> else, yes it will affect performance on the page
[06:06:33] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: 3 for every item added in the cart which would usually be ~3-5 items, but could go up to anything.
[06:06:44] <Cork> well hmm maybe not 15 but lets say 100
[06:06:57] <Nece228> Cork: thanks it works nicely on my code
[06:07:01] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: the change is fairly simple
[06:07:16] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: and it is a good idea as log as they do the same thing
[06:07:25] <Jeroenem> hey guys, how can i get the width of an element and print it on the element in the DOM as <div id="element "style="width:xxx;"> ?
[06:07:28] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: I honestly have a really hard time using/understanding .on and usually end up ragequitting before I figure it out and doing it some shitstorm way
[06:07:45] <DeltaHeavy> So while I'm at work I want to avoid it
[06:08:05] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: on is just a combination of the old functions
[06:08:15] <Cork> theres not really anything new there
[06:08:26] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Never used the old functions. Learned jQuery/JS/HTML/CSS starting 4 months ago
[06:08:31] <Cork> and you should REALLY learn how delegate works, it makes a big difference
[06:08:58] <DeltaHeavy> And everytime I try and use .on I just rage blindly calling jQuery documentation shit lol
[06:09:08] <fRAiLtY-> $('#deliverydate').on('change', function() { $('#despatchdate').find("option:selected").text()); }); Shouldn't this echo/return into a div the content of the selected option from the select? As it doesn't :x
[06:09:18] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: and its fairly simple too, just do ex. $(parent).on('click', '.cart-items', function() {});
[06:09:54] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: read the page for .delegate, its more in-depth then .on
[06:09:59] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: All three buttons are in the same div, should I give them each a div?
[06:10:08] <Cork> no need
[06:11:01] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: what you should try grasping is about sharing event handlers between multiple events that does the same thing but on different parents
[06:11:13] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: that makes you code much simpler and easier to maintain (and faster)
[06:11:32] <DeltaHeavy> Could you give me an example of this function with .on? $('#cart-tag_' + ID).keypress(function(e) { cartTag[ID] = $(this).val() + String.fromCharCode(e.which); });
[06:12:05] <DeltaHeavy> If you want to see the whole code I can tag off the login required to view decorgroupinc.com/store/test/quick_cart/
[06:12:54] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: could you make a jsfiddle with the html that relates to the cart and the event listners?
[06:13:03] <Cork> (preferably if the snippets work)
[06:13:37] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: All the content is inserted dynamically, and it's pretty complicated for me at least =X Would take a long time
[06:13:56] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: add some items and copy the generated html
[06:14:02] <DeltaHeavy> All this stuff is called from functions which calls other functions and other functions and other functions
[06:14:07] <Cork> its not that hard
[06:14:07] <DeltaHeavy> kk I'll give it a try
[06:14:37] <fRAiLtY-> See the lines at the bottom, the jQuery, doesn't append the div with the number from the drop-down http://jsfiddle.net/MZrSS/64/
[06:16:12] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Not going to get it working 100% since it uses AJAX to get a lot of the info
[06:16:52] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/6wUDM/
[06:18:16] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: You can alternativly go here, I've disabled the need to login: https://www.decorgroupinc.com/store/test/quick_cart/  -    Simply go to categories, Archways and ceilings, add the only item there, fill out some options, then it will add the stuff to the cart and call the function in question.
[06:18:23] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: wheres the buttons you talked about?
[06:19:14] <DeltaHeavy> They're showing up out of alignment in the jsfiddle, they're the 2 groups of 3 buttons on the right
[06:19:18] <agileadam> is it possible to loop through each div and remove the div if it's contents are equal to the div before it? It's gotta be, right?
[06:19:28] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: anyway 1. don't depend so heavily on classes, that makes it impossible to write generic code
[06:19:51] <Cork> 2. write the event listner for areas of the page, not for each element that exist
[06:20:02] <Cork> if you do that delegate should be much simpler to handle for you
[06:20:23] <Cork> agileadam: yes, more or less
[06:20:36] <DeltaHeavy> I'm not really following. What else would I use besides classes to group elements/events together?
[06:20:49] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: nothing
[06:20:50] <agileadam> Cork: good to know it should be achievable! haha. I'll figure it out...
[06:21:13] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: Then how do I give things CSS/call events?
[06:21:15] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: if you reference the elements togeather by the html structure, that should be all you need
[06:21:32] <DeltaHeavy> Cork: I don't understand
[06:21:34] <Cork> DeltaHeavy: by binding the event listners on the group
[06:23:25] <hlveheart> ε(●̮̮̃•̃)з
[06:23:56] * Falcon` encodes hlveheart
[06:24:36] <Cork> agileadam: something like var divs = $('div'); divs = divs.map(function(index) { if(index > 0 && divs.eq(index).html === $(this).html()) { return this; } return undefined; });
[06:24:40] <Cork> (untested!)
[06:24:50] <agileadam> Cork: thank you for taking the time to do that...
[06:24:50] <Cork> opps
[06:24:56] <Cork> agileadam: something like var divs = $('div'); divs = divs.map(function(index) { if(index > 0 && divs.eq(index-1).html === $(this).html()) { return this; } return undefined; });
[06:24:57] <agileadam> I just wrote this
[06:25:15] <blackspotwiggins> Cork, wouldnt filter() be better?
[06:25:29] <agileadam> http://pastebin.com/r7D6rMCV
[06:25:32] <agileadam> Is that pretty bad?
[06:25:40] <Cork> ah it gives the index too
[06:25:46] <Cork> didn't think it did, yes it is
[06:25:55] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: ^
[06:26:04] <agileadam> yes it's bad?
[06:26:08] <agileadam> :(
[06:26:15] <Cork> lol no
[06:26:18] <agileadam> ok.
[06:26:18] <agileadam> haha
[06:26:23] <Cork> that was a response to blackspotwiggins
[06:26:34] <agileadam> it's pretty elementary the way I did it… is your way better?
[06:26:49] <Cork> mine is bad in other ways
[06:26:53] <agileadam> hmm.k
[06:27:01] <blackspotwiggins> comparing html() seems kinda icky anyway
[06:27:02] <agileadam> I understand mine, so I'm gonna roll with it.
[06:27:07] <Cork> its point was to filter the selection
[06:27:07] <hlveheart> Mmm
[06:27:10] <hlveheart> Coffeeee
[06:27:17] <Cork> blackspotwiggins: it sure is
[06:27:18] <agileadam> Cork: gotcha.
[06:27:23] <Cork> but there isn't really another way

[07:10:17] <mynameisbrian> which jquery locations do most people use for cache? I know google/microsoft hosts them, I was wondering which ones most of you guys use.
[07:10:24] <Grundell> Zhy sweet :) I thought i might be able to use the same script before i save it instead
[07:10:47] <Zhy> Meaning ... ?
[07:10:53] <warrenparsons> mynameisbrian: Are you asking which CDN option we use? I always use Google's.
[07:11:08] <Zhy> Which script, the one working or the other one that gives you problems?
[07:11:21] <mynameisbrian> yeah warrenparsons, Ill check into google's then.
[07:11:51] <Grundell> I mean use it in the fallowing code.... http://pastebin.com/nb8uKxUp
[07:11:56] <Grundell> ,what do you think ?=
[07:12:16] <Grundell> So actually use it when i get the value out...

[07:13:33] <mynameisbrian> cool idea warrenparsons, thanks.
[07:13:47] <Grundell> Zhy - now none of the scripts work... So i thought we could remove classes from there instead...
[07:14:18] <Zhy> Grundell you want to put the code inside those <script>  tags ?
[07:14:24] <Grundell> yes
[07:14:34] <Zhy> Possible, sure
[07:14:45] <Zhy> But if not even that code is working , something is already amiss
[07:15:16] <Grundell> That's the post script and if we remove tags there that would be even better i belive
[07:15:46] <Grundell> zhy - well we could try ? though I'm not positive how to write it in there ...
[07:16:17] <Zhy> Does  the data that's being posted contain  the tags you want to remove or is that something else?

[07:17:55] <Flavius1924> any ideas of what the problem might be ?
[07:18:55] <Flavius1924> got it,it was the document.ready
[07:19:42] <Zhy> Grundell we'd still use the same code that - for some mysterious reason - doesn't work with your app :/
[07:19:54] <Zhy> the removeAttr( );
[07:20:22] <Zhy> or is "txtHint" something you want to remove the class / id / style from ?
[07:20:28] <Grundell> well this is in a different file that should work...
[07:20:35] <engaged> If I have an input like <input type="text" id="thisID" value="1234" orderID="55"> what is the proper way to access orderID? $("#thisID").attr("orderID") ?
[07:20:44] <Grundell> the question is where do we put the code zhy
[07:21:00] <Zhy> just above the function addpost(str) I'd say
[07:21:18] <Grundell> Okay
[07:21:20] <Zhy> with the closure  that seutje provided or in a $(document).ready(function(){ // HERE // } context
[07:21:55] <Zhy> OR you grab your JS and put it into external files which you reference from your html ;D
[07:22:50] <Grundell> Lol the code works there... though i need it to be on click when we save
[07:23:20] <Grundell> So it needs to be added somewhere inside the function addpost(str)
[07:25:24] <engaged> anyone?
[07:25:44] <Grundell> Zhy - do yoh know where that should be added in that case =
[07:25:47] <Zhy> I cannot tell you exactly where since that might depend upon the logic (e.g. return without that code being executed) but you can simply put the lines with $('li').removeAttr....  etc inside the addpost function
[07:27:30] <engaged> If I have an input like <input type="text" id="thisID" value="1234" orderID="55"> what is the proper way to access orderID? $("#thisID").attr("orderID") ?
[07:27:55] <Grundell> hmm... it doesn't want to post when I put in the top... do you have any idea where i could put it?
[07:28:14] <Zhy> engaged yes
[07:28:43] <Grundell> Zhy  - sorry didn't understand that...
[07:29:00] <Zhy> I was speaking to the user "engaged" :)
[07:29:09] <engaged> lol
[07:29:10] <engaged> thx
[07:29:15] <Grundell> Zhy - ahh
[07:29:16] <NodeX> engaged : you are better to use the data handler
[07:29:16] <Zhy> Grundell, does the script execute without errors ? it shouldn't interfere with the form submission
[07:29:23] <engaged> NodeX: whats the data handles
[07:29:24] <engaged> I tried
[07:29:36] <engaged> $("#thisID").data("orderID") and it didn't work
[07:29:44] <engaged> and .attr works fne
[07:29:55] <NodeX> <input type="text" id="thisID" value="1234" data-orderID="55"> ... var myval= $("#thisIs").data('orderId');
[07:30:03] <NodeX> <input type="text" id="thisID" value="1234" data-orderID="55"> ... var myval= $("#thisIs").data('orderID');
[07:30:14] <NodeX> thisID *
[07:30:23] <Grundell> Well what happens is that if i put it above var str1=document.getElementById('translations'); it's exected after i pushed the button
[07:30:30] <engaged> NodeX: why does it matter?
[07:30:35] <Grundell> So it removes everything from the template...
[07:30:45] <NoiseEee> engaged: don't just go making up your own attributes; if you must, precede them with 'data-'.   'data-orderid', not 'orderid'
[07:30:54] <engaged> but why
[07:30:54] <NodeX> why does what matter?>
[07:31:01] <engaged> why cant i make up my own field
[07:31:07] <engaged> why should i do data-orderID
[07:31:09] <NoiseEee> it would be invalid markup.
[07:31:14] <NodeX> ^^
[07:31:34] <NoiseEee> and once you have invalid markup, your JS unguaranteed
[07:33:26] <r3v3rb> bah, nothing works! lol
[07:34:14] <Zhy> Grundell I don't know, you could try to put it at the end of addpost .. I'm not familiar with that code that's being executed in the addpost so might be that what you put at the end of that function is never reached
[07:34:26] <r3v3rb> how can I override li a:hover in jquery to allow menu li mouseover to work properly :(
[07:34:27] <Grundell> okay
[07:34:41] <Zhy> Grundell where is addpost called?
[07:34:52] <Zhy> somewhere in your html? or from another js function?
[07:34:56] <Grundell> button onclich
[07:35:23] <Grundell> <button type="button"  onclick="addpost('11')" >post it to the list </button>
[07:35:59] <NodeX> inline = BAD juju
[07:39:48] <Progster> anyone here familiar with jquery ui autocomplete?
[07:40:16] <Grundell> zhy - btw is there something like "on pageLoad" that i could use as a trigger ?
[07:42:02] <Zhy> I think you can do something like <body onload="">... but afaik it'd be cleaner (and NodeX hinted at inline js being badsy) to have it elsewhere
[07:42:29] <Zhy> $(document).ready(function(){ // your code here }  is what I'd use
[07:42:34] <Zhy> but I use it in an external JS file
[07:42:41] <Zhy> not inside <script> tags
[07:42:58] <Grundell> yes
[07:49:05] <psbanka> Hey there, I'm having trouble runnint qunit under Rhino on Centos 6; Getting an "invalid property id" when loading qunit.js.. any thoughts?

[07:51:57] <Gromdroid> I want to send data from a textbox to a local html file, can somebody help me with this?
[07:52:31] <engaged> I am doing a jquery to show a <span>, but once I show it moves the elements next to it... is there a way to have it invisible at first, but make the other elements think it is visible so they dont shift when it shows & hides?
[07:52:35] <r3v3rb> anyone ?
[07:53:05] <r3v3rb> how can I override my menus 'a:hover' not to supercede the jquery mouseover
[07:53:35] <r3v3rb> for a fade in effect - I really don't want to add extra libraries 'suckerfish' for example
[07:55:23] <karl_heinz> how can I check if all checkboxes of class A are unselected
[07:56:56] <amirite> how do i select checkboxes which have the attribute checked set
[07:57:04] <amirite> which are really checked
[07:57:09] <amirite> not pseudo checked
[07:57:13] <amirite> like on page load
[08:02:04] <amirite> jQuery(':checkbox').prop('checked', false);
[08:02:04] <amirite> jQuery('input[checked="checked"]').prop('checked', true)
[08:03:06] <engaged> im doing a <div style="width:100px;"> but it ain't working... how come?
[08:03:30] <karl_heinz> engaged: this is for jquery, ask in #html or #web
[08:04:04] <Flavius1924> is there a way to make the function to be independent ?hovering over an image not to affect the other one ? http://jsfiddle.net/nPeaV/3805/
[08:07:50] <krismeld> hi everyone, is there a way to set a max window width with jquery?
[08:08:26] <krismeld> so if you resize window above the set value, the window shrinks to the max value
[08:08:26] <fRAiLtY-> How to alert the value of the selected option? http://pastie.org/4193462
[08:09:29] <timing> krismeld: you cannot change the window width when a browser is fullscreen afaik
[08:10:36] <krismeld> ok ty
[08:21:26] <N00b> hi guys... i have a question about doing a JSON post in internet explorer. anyone attempted anything like this?
[08:22:19] <NodeX> what's the error
[08:22:37] <NodeX> make sure you dont have a trailing "," on your last object member
[08:23:27] <N00b> no trailing ,
[08:24:00] <N00b> let me try and find what the error is... its reading error on line 4193 in jquery v 1.7.2
[08:31:57] <camwest> Hey folks, I'm trying to programmatically drag&drop something and I was wondering if jQuery supports "real" events like document.createEvent("MouseEvent")? Or does it use it's own internal event types?
[08:32:37] <shoky> camwest you were wondering what?
[08:33:13] <shoky> how would it handle mouse events without.. handling mouse events ?
[08:33:52] <camwest> Well $(element).onmouseover(function() {}); $(element).trigger('mouseover'); might not actually use a real DOM Level 2 event, that's what I'm wondering
[08:34:07] <camwest> $(element).mouseover(function(){}); rather
[08:34:34] <Nece228> im wondering on finding the best way to check if in a table there are empty inputs
[08:34:59] <shoky> camwest: eventually it'd have to use real events, no./
[08:35:00] <shoky> ?
[08:35:01] <Nece228> so i would validate form inputs
[08:35:20] <camwest> shoky: not necessarily for trigger
[08:35:28] <camwest> document.addEventListener("mouseover", function() { console.log('MOUSEOVER') }); $(document).trigger('mouseover'); <--- no console.log is observed
[08:35:30] <shoky> well for trigger, yea..
[08:35:53] <camwest> $(document).mouseover(function() { console.log('MOUSEOVER') }); $(document).trigger('mouseover') <-- console.log is observed
[08:36:05] <shoky> right
[08:36:27] <camwest> So I'm trying to use jQuery to trigger real events, I'm wondering if that can be done
[08:36:31] <shoky> but then, programatically triggering a "real" mouse event makes no sense, does it?
[08:36:41] <camwest> Well for my use-case it does
[08:36:52] <camwest> Since I don't' have access to the code that is setting up the listeners
[08:40:40] <Master_ex> hey, I want to show a 3 column layout by using the jqueryui show with the slide effect. To create the 3 column layout I use float: right and left in the css. However, it doesn't slides work as long as the float:right; attribute is there. Any idea?
[08:42:40] <mightym> hey guys, I'm making a ajax() call passing a json object via post to my server, on every browser except for iOS safari it works great. on iOS safari it seems to load forever and my server responds with a 404. does someone have encountered this problem before?
[08:42:58] <mightym> i mean a 403
[08:45:40] <some_dude> hi, got a question regarding jquery
[08:45:54] <aro> false, martians dont wear hats
[08:46:08] <shoky> camwest welp, i think the answer to your question is nope :P
[08:46:10] <aro> whats ur question
[08:46:22] <camwest> shoky: lol I unfortunately agree
[08:46:30] <shoky> ;]
[08:46:49] <camwest> shoky: I figured as much I just thought I might have been missing something, the DOM api isn't too bad it's just IE9+
[08:46:52] <some_dude> can I use DW 5.5. with jquery as to graphically position widgets on the screen and edit their properties etc. (sort of like you'd do with html forms) ?
[08:47:04] <aro> dw?
[08:47:09] <aro> as in.. dreamweaver?
[08:47:15] <some_dude> aye
[08:47:16] <fRAiLtY-> What's wrong here: http://pastie.org/4193647 I'm trying to say if the 4th select in the product-options-wrapper has a selected value that's not 24hrs then check whether it says 5 working days or 10 working days and show the div with the date appended accordingly, but nothing happens :x
[08:47:20] <aro> i assume you mean cs 5.5
[08:47:29] <some_dude> yes
[08:47:42] <aro> did u try looking at some of the extensions available for it
[08:47:54] <some_dude> I mean , just drag and drop say Jquery tabs element and fill it up etc. so I dont have  to code the thing by hand
[08:48:32] <aro> thats half the fun
[08:48:37] <some_dude> of course I'd like to know about any other WYSIWYG GUI ediotrs for jquery
[08:49:24] <some_dude> aro; sure but I just like to position my elemnts first properly and then go into the code. I hate typing html code by hand, I seriously do. :)
[08:51:09] <some_dude> something like maqetta.org/  but for jquerry
[08:51:33] <raj> sup shoky
[08:54:23] <shoky> aights sup raj
[08:55:39] <fRAiLtY-> What's wrong here: http://pastie.org/4193647 I'm trying to say if the 4th select in the product-options-wrapper has a selected value that's not 24hrs then check whether it says 5 working days or 10 working days and show the div with the date appended accordingly, but nothing happens :x
[08:57:27] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: jQuery('product-options-wrapper')
[09:00:47] <GreekFreak> Why would the success part of $.ajax not get called? it won't even display a console.log("hello")
[09:01:21] <aro> maybe its failing?
[09:01:30] <aro> or you have another listener catching it
[09:01:55] <gwinh_dev> did you checked the response from firebug?
[09:02:10] <mac_nibblet> Anybody here using the autocomplete?
[09:02:16] <GreekFreak> gwinh_dev, it's giving the response I expect from the server
[09:02:31] <mac_nibblet> i would like to add the search result to the database if the user presses enter
[09:02:46] <shoky> GreekFreak: do you have an error handler as well
[09:02:46] <mac_nibblet> but that seams to fire both the search & insert if i use seperate methods
[09:02:53] <mac_nibblet> and i cannot figre how to cancel out the other
[09:03:21] <GreekFreak> shoky, not in js, but in rails I'm create a json based on the fact that the object is invalid
[09:03:56] <GreekFreak> shoky, but like I said, it's responding with the expected json's
[09:04:14] <chris_mh> hi there. I'm using the jquery ui datepicker on text-input fields. there is no text in the input's value in the html; I'm setting the default date when I create the datepicker.
[09:04:21] <shoky> GreekFreak: add an error handler
[09:04:35] <chris_mh> I'd like the default date to be populated into the text in the input. how do I tell it to do this?
[09:04:55] <fRAiLtY-> shoky:  Where/why/what jQuery('product-options-wrapper) ?
[09:04:58] <chris_mh> I've googled around a bit, but I'm not familiar enough with jquery to craft good googles for this problem
[09:05:04] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: take a close look.
[09:05:20] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: giving you any more info would make you feel really dumb :P
[09:05:28] <GreekFreak> I added a "failure" option and it's displayed things from in there. Is the error handler supposed to be server side or in the $.ajax call?
[09:05:28] <fRAiLtY-> Oh ffs
[09:05:30] <fRAiLtY-> Sorry
[09:05:51] <shoky> GreekFreak: an error handler for the $.ajax . client side
[09:06:29] <GreekFreak> shoky, thanx. reading up on it now
[09:06:44] <hlveheart> shoky, why are you so great?
[09:07:00] <shoky> just for you, hlveheart
[09:07:42] <GreekFreak> shoky, can you explain to me why it "fails" since it's returned what I expect?
[09:07:45] <chris_mh> anyone, on the datepicker default?
[09:07:50] <hlveheart> :>
[09:14:09] <NoiseEee> GreekFreak: if you've determined on the backend that the data is no-good (logic wise), you can send back an appropriate "failure" http header, or you can choose to send it back as a key in the returned json... ie {"status":"fail", "failMsg":"bad data"}
[09:14:14] <chris_mh> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/233553/how-do-i-pre-populate-a-jquery-datepicker-textbox-with-todays-date
[09:14:19] <chris_mh> the second one looks pretty good, thanks
[09:15:08] <NoiseEee> GreekFreak: but obviously the failure handle is only going to work with the http header route,
[09:21:02] <Nece228> how to check for all inputs and validate if they are not empty
[09:22:11] <ryanneufeld> ?each @ Nece228
[09:22:12] <bot-t> Nece228, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[09:22:16] <uir> hey, is there anything like $(elem).parent().find(selector)?
[09:22:27] <ryanneufeld> uir: yes, that
[09:22:36] <uir> ryanneufeld: more simple ;)
[09:22:41] <uir> a mix between filter() and find() ;)
[09:22:47] <Nece228> ryanneufeld: no easier way like find()?
[09:22:49] <ryanneufeld> what's wrong with that?
[09:22:58] <uir> parent() ryanneufeld
[09:23:01] <uir> i don't want to use that
[09:23:15] <uir> or does no other way exist, ryanneufeld?
[09:23:50] <ryanneufeld> uir: see ?siblings
[09:23:51] <bot-t> uir, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[09:25:12] <uir> ryanneufeld: cool, thanks ;)
[09:25:14] <ryanneufeld> Nece228: there is no built in way to validate the form. That's up to you. you can use ? serializeArray
[09:25:15] <bot-t> Nece228, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[09:25:47] <J4M> I have a question but it may not be jquery related
[09:26:00] <Nece228> ryanneufeld: i found that $(input:empty) works, is it good method?
[09:26:43] <Nece228> or it doesnt
[09:26:45] <Nece228> anyway
[09:26:49] <Nece228> thanks ill check these out
[09:26:53] <J4M> I'm using jquery cycle to rotate images, using Before: to call a function that does opts.addSlide, so it's rotating an image every minute. the "images" in question is just one static .jpg image that updates, so I need to use a random query string so it'll actually update
[09:27:30] <J4M> the issue is that it caches the images, and increases RAM usage. I was wondering if it were possible to get image.jpg and update it, or make it so it doesn't cache
[09:27:50] <J4M> I tried no-cache http headers
[09:28:04] <ryanneufeld> J4M: you're using an image rotate plugin to rotate one image?
[09:28:15] <ryanneufeld> I think you're doing it wrong
[09:28:32] <ryanneufeld> also, setting no cache causes the browser to redownload the image every time
[09:28:34] <ryanneufeld> you want caching
[09:28:40] <J4M> in this case I don't
[09:28:47] <J4M> because image.jpg changes
[09:29:02] <ryanneufeld> how?
[09:31:20] <NoiseEee> J4M:   loadImageCommand("/path/to/image.jpg?microsecondsOrRandomJunk");
[09:32:07] <ryanneufeld> ?demo @ J4M
[09:32:07] <bot-t> J4M, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:32:27] <J4M> alright
[09:35:43] <AxonetBE> if I want to find this $('input[name="order[3607]"]')
[09:36:05] <AxonetBE> but my name comes from $(this).attr("name"), how can I concatenate this?
[09:37:30] <ryanneufeld> AxonetBE: do you know how to concatonate strings?
[09:37:32] <skisulli> AxonetBE: is this what you are looking for? $('input[name="' + $(this).attr('name') + '"]');
[09:37:42] <ryanneufeld> ^^^
[09:38:04] <AxonetBE> skisulli: thanks
[09:45:08] <Er343> hi all! :)
[09:45:14] <ryanneufeld> yo

[09:49:38] <ryanneufeld> The conf was pretty cool
[09:50:04] <quantegy> I had no idea that was bassistance
[09:50:12] <ryanneufeld> ?
[09:50:15] <quantegy> I felt like a fan and he was the rockstar
[09:50:21] <ryanneufeld> whom?
[09:50:26] <quantegy> one of the presenters
[09:50:47] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I got that part. I meant whom of them do you speak?
[09:51:18] <quantegy> bassistance?
[09:51:27] <quantegy> it was the 2nd day
[09:51:31] <Drake> Hi, I was wondering what the cleanest way was to check if all checkboxes in formX are checked. I know how to do it with just one ... ( .is(':checked') ) but I can't seem to figure how to automate this for a list of 5 checkboxes ...
[09:51:32] <quantegy> i can't recall his name
[09:51:35] <quantegy> tall skinny guy
[09:51:42] <quantegy> glasses
[09:51:52] <ryanneufeld> That narrows it down... lol
[09:51:56] <quantegy> hah
[09:51:59] <quantegy> german i think
[09:52:34] <ryanneufeld> Shane Riely?
[09:52:45] <ryanneufeld> derp, Riley
[09:52:46] <quantegy> nope
[09:52:48] <Drake> I just need a boolean return, not interested in which ones are checked
[09:53:03] <ryanneufeld> OH, Jorn
[09:53:17] <quantegy> i think so yes
[09:53:24] <ryanneufeld> checked his website
[09:53:28] <ryanneufeld> yes, that's whom you speak of
[09:53:29] <ryanneufeld> nice guy
[09:53:45] <quantegy> awesome i use his validation plugin religiously
[09:53:59] <ryanneufeld> so do we
[09:54:09] <ryanneufeld> Wish I'd known it was him when I met him
[09:54:21] <quantegy> there was a cool breakout on arduino programming using JS
[09:54:25] <quantegy> that was a mind blower
[09:54:25] <ryanneufeld> I was there
[09:54:27] <jdummy> Jorn Zaeferrer
[09:54:32] <ryanneufeld> I was the other guy with one
[09:54:38] <quantegy> oh hey ryan
[09:54:41] <ryanneufeld> Haha
[09:54:49] <quantegy> i was chris i commented on your deadmau5 shirt
[09:55:05] <ryanneufeld> We chatted in the cafe right?
[09:55:09] <quantegy> how did you get all that crap on the plane?
[09:55:09] <ryanneufeld> am first day?
[09:55:12] <quantegy> yes the first day
[09:55:15] <ryanneufeld> I had it in my bad
[09:55:17] <ryanneufeld> *bag
[09:55:23] <ryanneufeld> just brought it throught
[09:55:34] <ryanneufeld> just made sure nothing looked bomb like
[09:55:40] <quantegy> ah, I bet the TSA was like 'Oh boy, what's this'
[09:55:46] <quantegy> LOL
[09:55:51] <ryanneufeld> (having never built one I wasn't sure what it would look like)
[09:55:58] <ryanneufeld> never even flinched at it
[09:55:58] <quantegy> true
[09:56:00] <ryanneufeld> both ways
[09:56:22] <quantegy> you gave out some prime info in that breakout
[09:56:29] <Kae> hi guys, quick question, when using e.which inside keypress jquery event, the value will be the same in any computer, mac or pc?
[09:56:38] <quantegy> all the people sitting around me were jaw-dropped
[09:56:52] <shoky> Drake: var cbs = $('form').find(':checkbox');  cbs.length == cbs.filter(':checked')
[09:57:04] <jdummy> Anyone know the trick to selecting VML nodes in IE with jQuery?  Using Raphaeljs + jQuery for a project
[09:57:23] <ryanneufeld> quantegy: I'm on twitter, same username
[09:57:35] <quantegy> ok, ryann, I'll look you up
[09:57:43] <quantegy> i gotta get back to this dreaded FB SDK
[09:58:01] <quantegy> i am under qualsh on twitter
[09:58:37] <Drake> shoky: then I have the length, but I don't want to fix it to a specific length, it has to be able to work for 10 or 20 seconds (without me changing the requirement each time)
[09:59:13] <shoky> Drake: what?
[10:00:06] <Drake> shoky: nvm, misread your snippet. Thanks, was exactly what I was looking for :)
[10:00:09] <shoky> Drake: another way:  $('form').find(':checkbox').not(':checked').length == 0
[10:00:30] <ryanneufeld> Kae: are the docs on it any help?
[10:01:32] <Kae> I just found this is a secure way to get the value because some browser user keycode other charcode, e.which standardize that... but nothing about if the values will be the same on all the platforms
[10:04:27] <pothibo> Hi, I would like to have some pointer, I have a popup that has a height of 100px and it has a parent div. I want to know if the available space between the bottom of parent div and the border of the viewport is > 100px, any tips?
[10:06:05] <ryanneufeld> pothibo: you're gonna have to do some math
[10:06:33] <pothibo> ryanneufeld: $(window).height() - offset.y ?
[10:07:58] <pothibo> offset.top I meant ;) but yeah I think I found my way out
[10:08:05] <ryanneufeld> pothibo: there you go
[10:08:12] <ryanneufeld> this is a tricky one
[10:08:22] <ryanneufeld> we had a similar problem to solve on our lyrics pages
[10:08:46] <ryanneufeld> when you click on a song meaning it would scroll the page so it had enough room for the popup
[10:09:09] <ryanneufeld> pothibo: you can see teh result by clicking on the yellow lines on this page http://www.metrolyrics.com/someone-like-you-lyrics-adele.html
[10:10:01] <pothibo> ryanneufeld: nice
[10:10:10] <pothibo> We know what you've been listening to ;)
[10:10:21] <ryanneufeld> pothibo: I'm one of the developers on that site
[10:10:32] <ryanneufeld> also, I do like Adele, the woman can sing
[10:10:35] <pothibo> ryanneufeld: lol I didn't read previous :)
[10:10:40] <pothibo> And yeah, I love her too
[10:10:45] <ravenzz> I made a lightbox that switch the position absolute/fixed depending on the available space
[10:10:47] <pothibo> Wasn't condescendant ;)
[10:10:54] <ryanneufeld> Anyone else get one of the BB Playbooks at teh JQConf?
[10:11:02] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: nice
[10:11:10] <ryanneufeld> pothibo: didn't take it that way :)
[10:11:11] <quantegy> nope they got stingy with me
[10:11:37] <pothibo> ryanneufeld: how many people are running that site?
[10:11:56] <ryanneufeld> fewer than you'd expect :p
[10:11:59] <ravenzz> but I need to fix a bug, I can share the code if someone want to contribute
[10:12:16] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: there's a great site for that called github.com
[10:12:18] <ryanneufeld> ;)
[10:12:27] <pothibo> ryanneufeld: :)
[10:12:59] <ravenzz> I know
[10:13:09] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: lol, i was only teasing
[10:13:44] <ravenzz> eh
[10:13:56] <whitenoise> what are the reasons in which i could successfully call a function from chrome's dev console and it works, but it does not work in an ajax call's success callback?
[10:14:04] <whitenoise> and yes, the ajax calls are succeeding.
[10:14:29] <ryanneufeld> ?demo
[10:14:30] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:14:42] <jedimind> www.jqueryto.com </spam> for anyone intersted in getting on the list for the first canadian jquery conf
[10:15:03] <whitenoise> jsfiddle is horrible and takes too long
[10:15:04] <whitenoise> but i can pastie.
[10:15:55] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: I would disagree strongly with your assessment of jsfiddle. But seeing the code one way or another helps
[10:17:51] <whitenoise> ryanneufeld, like this: http://pastie.org/private/e8f3f5d6usnacrn0hz0yca
[10:17:55] <whitenoise> except there's many ajax calls.
[10:18:06] <whitenoise> but, the call is succeeding, this is just an addition to the code.
[10:18:19] <whitenoise> and i can call semaphore() in dev console and it works fine
[10:18:34] <whitenoise> and all the other functions the success is calling works, too. i dunno why its doing that.
[10:20:20] <austinallen> Can you guys check out my portfolio and give some feedback please? :D
[10:20:23] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: so, is response.success === true? does your error function get called?
[10:20:34] <austinallen> www.austinlallen.com
[10:20:38] <whitenoise> ryanneufeld, right, success is true on all accounts.
[10:20:39] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: also, try using .done() and .fail()
[10:20:47] <whitenoise> .done and .fail?
[10:20:51] <whitenoise> i was not aware of these.
[10:20:59] <ryanneufeld> yes, see ?ajax
[10:20:59] <bot-t> yes, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:21:19] <ryanneufeld> check the examples
[10:22:06] <ajustrun> can someone tell me why this jsfiddle isnt working? http://jsfiddle.net/fUweq/
[10:22:16] <ryanneufeld> can you say please?
[10:22:17] <ajustrun> prob something dumb i dont know about JS
[10:22:19] <ajustrun> please
[10:22:21] <ajustrun> :-D
[10:22:29] <ajustrun> sorry just frustrated
[10:22:39] <ryanneufeld> haha, just teasing you
[10:22:43] <ajustrun> lol
[10:22:58] <ryanneufeld> well, first off, this is a jquery channel, your fiddle is just JS. That's fine
[10:23:05] <ryanneufeld> I'll tell you what's wrong any how
[10:23:14] <ajustrun> thanks mate i appreciate it
[10:23:19] <ryanneufeld> you want onclick='toggleAddressFields'
[10:23:21] <ryanneufeld> you want onclick='toggleAddressFields()'
[10:23:55] <ryanneufeld> no, that being said, what you actually should do is use jquery to bind to the click event on that anchor, cause onclicks are a pain to test and diagnose
[10:24:24] <ajustrun> yeah
[10:24:26] <ryanneufeld> and are generally frowned upon, though I'm not entirely sure why. I just don't like them
[10:24:37] <ajustrun> why cant i just call the js function the way i tried to?
[10:24:49] <ryanneufeld> clearly because it doesn't work
[10:26:36] <ajustrun> ryanneufeld: yeah but why?
[10:26:39] <ajustrun> i do that elsewhere on my site
[10:26:43] <ajustrun> and it works fine
[10:26:56] <ryanneufeld> okay, well, stop it. Cause it's a bad habbit
[10:26:59] <ryanneufeld> :P
[10:27:00] <ajustrun> ok will do
[10:27:07] <ajustrun> so .click is the way to go always?
[10:27:10] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure why this example isn't working
[10:27:16] <ryanneufeld> are you mixing them?
[10:27:43] <ajustrun> mixing .click and the js fucntion call in the html?
[10:28:29] <ryanneufeld> yes, are you mixing href javascript calls with jquery?
[10:28:31] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/fUweq/1/
[10:28:34] <ajustrun> nope
[10:28:37] <ryanneufeld> good
[10:28:59] <ajustrun> yeah i implemented it like you just showed
[10:29:33] <whitenoise> ryanneufeld, aha. so done and fail are the future success and errors.
[10:29:55] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: yes, and they set you up to use deferreds which are sessy
[10:30:30] <whitenoise> i thought the entirety of ajax was basically a deferred?
[10:33:01] <ryanneufeld> whitenoise: it returns a mashing of xhr+promise. An enhanced xhr object dubbed a jqXHR
[10:33:46] <ryanneufeld> allows you to use it as a promise, like you would from a deferred, or like an XHR object like you might do with older jquery. Keeps the api the same and makes interop with older code easier.
[10:34:14] <whitenoise> so basically, the new stuff is just phasing out "old code"
[10:34:20] <whitenoise> since it is far less common
[10:34:23] <whitenoise> we are progressing!
[10:34:43] <ryanneufeld> it's called deprecation
[10:34:47] <ryanneufeld> and it's neccessary
[10:34:53] <whitenoise> indee
[10:34:54] <whitenoise> d
[10:35:04] <ezio> can i extend the results of an anonymous function?
[10:35:15] <ezio> already tried
[10:35:58] <ezio> $.extend(function() { var obj = new Object; return obj; }, myobj);
[10:36:03] <ezio> not able to break inside it
[10:36:28] <ezio> actually i want the function last
[10:38:02] <shoky> ezio: that's not the result of the anonymous function
[10:38:19] <shoky> that's the function itself, not its return value (you didn't even call it)
[10:38:50] <shoky> ezio: $.extend( (function() { return smth; })(), myobj )
[10:39:10] <shoky> or better yet don't make that function anonymous/inline
[10:40:14] <ezio> i like your solution ... it's a multi line function any ways ... i only want to do it this way so i can see all the things i'm joining
[10:40:44] <shoky> function createObject() { ...; return newObject; }
[10:40:50] <shoky> $.extend( createObject(), myobj )
[10:40:53] <shoky> much nicer
[10:41:17] <ezio> myobj is actually an initalization for a data table
[10:41:25] <ezio> not actually a var
[10:41:25] <shoky> whatevz ;P
[10:41:26] <ezio> my obj
[10:43:44] <RohanBhangui> sry to post code but i just need the following line answered
[10:43:46] <RohanBhangui> window.onscroll = function () { window.scrollTo(0, 0); };
[10:44:08] <RohanBhangui> is there any way to make the screen not jumpy when using this
[10:45:55] <ajustrun> rohan i think you need to use .animate
[10:45:59] <ajustrun> RohanBhangui
[10:46:08] <Grundell> hmm. does any one know how to get a script that works well in jsFiddle in to worpress working well ?
[10:46:17] <Grundell> Can't seam to get it to work atm.
[10:46:28] <RohanBhangui> example?
[10:46:41] <Grundell> http://jsfiddle.net/JekUU/10/
[10:46:41] <ajustrun> sorry i dont really know
[10:47:40] <gaspyr> hello
[10:48:03] <Grundell> RohanBhangui - Got any idea ?
[10:48:18] <gaspyr> rohan here :D
[10:48:22] <Grundell> it's really a simple script but i just can't get tit to work
[10:48:33] <RohanBhangui> sry i was actually responding to ajustrun
[10:48:50] <Grundell> Okayu
[10:48:53] <Grundell> ...
[10:49:03] <gaspyr> wats that grundell ? actually many simple scripts are starting to not work these days :D
[10:49:35] <Grundell> gaspyr - iv'e noticed. i want to remove classes
[10:49:59] <RohanBhangui> gas: i may go offline suddenly
[10:50:03] <gaspyr> either use .removeClass() method
[10:50:05] <RohanBhangui> just stay onlinein skype and ill ttyl
[10:50:06] <Grundell> gaspyr - attributes  and hide one div...
[10:50:26] <gaspyr> or use the toggleClass() without any parameter, it will directly remove all classes
[10:50:50] <gaspyr> to hide a div use .hide() or attr('hidden','hidden')
[10:50:52] <Grundell> i did and it works with jsfiddle  do i cant get it to work with my wp installation
[10:51:00] <gaspyr> or css => display : none
[10:51:05] <Grundell> http://jsfiddle.net/JekUU/10/
[10:51:11] <gaspyr> i check it
[10:51:30] <Grundell> thats the script it works as i want it to but i cant get it tot work with wp
[10:51:49] <Grundell> so i thought thas some one might just have an idea why i doesn't work with WP
[10:51:50] <gaspyr> rohan , if u can ping me wud be good, im started debbuging for real the app and running into stupid prob
[10:53:09] <gaspyr> grundell u want to hide the lis too ?
[10:53:37] <Grundell> gaspyr - no i want it to work Exactly as it does there
[10:54:29] <gaspyr> ok debbuging :)
[10:57:06] <Grundell> gaspyr - yes and since im not really a master at jQuery i was asking if some one know how to help me or point me in the right dfirection atleast...
[10:57:47] <RohanBhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/Ny587/
[10:57:56] <RohanBhangui> anyway to get rid of jumpiness wehn you drag rohan
[10:58:40] <quantegy> Grundell what do you need help with?
[10:59:09] <Grundell> quantegy - http://jsfiddle.net/JekUU/10/ get that script to work with my WP installation
[11:00:36] <quantegy> did you try jQuery?
[11:00:42] <quantegy> instead of $
[11:00:52] <Grundell> quantegy - It seams like it has some problem working... and since I'm really not in to working with jQuery i thought some one might know what i've done wrong...
[11:00:56] <gaspyr> btw
[11:01:06] <gaspyr> are u sure u inserted a script src=""jquery_file
[11:01:09] <Grundell> quantegy - yes
[11:01:10] <gaspyr> in the head ?
[11:01:26] <Grundell> gaspyr - hes
[11:01:36] <quantegy> check  to see that WP is enqueuing jQuery
[11:02:01] <quantegy> i know in WP 3.3 you have to use jQuery(function(){});
[11:02:05] <quantegy> not $();
[11:02:12] <quantegy> you can map it to $
[11:02:19] <Grundell> I get the "stip.js" file to show up in recourses though i get unexpected token ILLEGAL
[11:02:26] <quantegy> by doing jQuery(function($){})
[11:02:44] <lancealtar> jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {});
[11:03:12] <Grundell> quantegy, actually tried both ways... no success
[11:03:53] <Grundell> btw do i have to exchange all $ for jQuery
[11:03:54] <Grundell> ?
[11:04:17] <lancealtar> Grundell: Not if you wrap everything inside jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {});
[11:04:34] <jeffsmykil> there are problems with every single canvas library
[11:04:41] <Grundell> okay... still no luck
[11:04:59] <Grundell> if you know how to read debugging you could visit http://dev.copypanthers.com/lost_in_translation/866
[11:05:08] <Grundell> user: devpanther
[11:05:14] <Grundell> pass: C0pypantherS
[11:05:34] <Grundell> I need to run away a quick while but be right back :)
[11:05:48] <Grundell> I really do apreciate that you take time for this guys
[11:06:06] <gaspyr> im still trying to figure what's wrong O_O
[11:06:28] <quantegy> lol
[11:06:48] <quantegy> o_0
[11:06:59] <jeffsmykil> fabricjs doesn't seem to like images buigger than the canvas, or make changes until you actually touch the ccanvas
[11:07:19] <gaspyr> but anyway, why even use style :display block on a div ?
[11:09:23] <aamax> hi all. i have a form with a select box.  the select currently allows multi selecting and i want to change it to a single select only.  how would i do that?

[11:15:26] <varnie> Hi there. what's more preferable and why: 1) $('form[name="foo"] input[id^="bar"]:checked") or 2) $('input[id^="bar"]:checked, $form); ?
[11:15:54] <cohitre> varnie: both are horrible
[11:17:03] <cohitre> give the input a class and do "input.bar:checked"
[11:17:09] <varnie> here's the full version: http://pastebin.com/Fkw20tqP
[11:17:37] <cohitre> if you already have a reference to your form do $form.find("input.bar:checked")
[11:18:20] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I need to shrink a table's row to 0, then make it dissapear but I'm not having much luck shrinking the <tr> without messing up the formatting by putting <divs> inside. What's the best way to accomplish this?
[11:18:32] <varnie> what about the lines 15 and 22 in the code I posted above?
[11:18:49] <varnie> is this "style" okay?
[11:20:18] <varnie> say, if I am into the delegate function, I do this: "$('input[id^="pop_re_"]:checked', e.delegateTarget).each(...)". I would like to know whether or not using e.delegateTarget is correct there and what's the better way.
[11:23:25] <katy5289> hi
[11:23:33] <hlveheart> shoky, you here?
[11:23:45] <katy5289> I need help displaying data entered into a form
[11:24:15] <NoiseEee> varnie: .delegate() is old, please use .on()  http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:24:56] <aamax> so no way to remove the multiple from a select box that you guys know of?
[11:25:11] <varnie> NoiseEee, thank you.
[11:26:21] <gaspyr> do uve an attribute multiple=""multiple ?
[11:26:34] <gaspyr> * sry was answering u but got disconnected
[11:28:03] <aamax> in the definition it has multiple="multiple" if that's what your asking.  i basically need to completely remove the multiple reference if possible
[11:28:20] <jarr0dsz> any jquery experts in here :P ?
[11:28:32] <gaspyr> well thats exactly what i eepected, so just remove that multiple attribute ull be fine :)
[11:28:45] <gaspyr> hi jarr0dz , im big noob :)
[11:28:52] <jarr0dsz> i have written a jquery function to reload pieces of my page, empty and replacing div with http://pastie.org/private/yhqxur2ybwvrgvufwro7sg but the problem is I woudl like to loop true all .timer classes and give them an ID
[11:29:03] <jarr0dsz> so you can loop true all of them and reload all of them
[11:29:12] <jarr0dsz> now they all reload at once, anyone an idea what function I would need for that? already gave the div an unique ID
[11:29:18] <jarr0dsz> for each .timer there is an id="timer.i
[11:29:26] <jarr0dsz> timer.id that increments ;p
[11:30:23] <gaspyr> use the each() method
[11:30:34] <varnie> could you help me with this very simple piece of code? http://pastebin.com/HTCx8jtF I'd like to know what can be improved.
[11:32:25] <gaspyr> $(  #networks  > 'input[ .....]' )
[11:32:36] <ryanneufeld> varnie: http://pastebin.com/dRE9UHBR That's about all I would change.
[11:33:19] <ryanneufeld> varnie: only other thing you can do is give the input an id of cat, then you can just use $('#cat').val()
[11:33:39] <ryanneufeld> varnie: http://pastebin.com/JF3ssRnn
[11:33:39] <gaspyr> use that descendant selector, instead of searching two times two jquery objects
[11:47:20] <Grundell> gaspyr - back took longer than i thought...
[11:47:33] <Grundell> gaspyr - do you have any ideas  ?
[11:47:40] <gaspyr> sry me too lost connection
[11:47:57] <gaspyr> i checked and css and html is clean
[11:48:19] <gaspyr> checked to c if an id wasn't in the page, but nthg
[11:48:47] <Grundell> yes.. i get an error code unexpected token ILLEGAL
[11:48:51] <gaspyr> nthg in console as well
[11:49:04] <gaspyr> only error was about the link to picture
[11:49:18] <intkftajq> illegal picture?
[11:49:24] <intkftajq> ;)
[11:49:49] <gaspyr> lol :D
[11:52:10] <jarr0dsz> is there a way to set a var in jquery to global?
[11:52:19] <jarr0dsz> hacked together for 30 minutes but got it working :D
[11:52:32] <jarr0dsz> only need a var to be global
[11:52:42] <KolakCC1> jarr0dsz: set it as a property of window
[11:52:46] <gaspyr> sure pass it to the jquery ready function as parameter :D
[11:52:59] <gaspyr> or what kolac said :D
[11:53:11] <gaspyr> u can do it this way
[11:53:20] <gaspyr> i need fiddle, 1 sec
[11:53:21] <jarr0dsz> KolakCC1: i now have http://pastie.org/private/xf5whpj8wawecmdns4uoha how do you mean set it as peroperty of window?
[11:53:27] <KolakCC1> window.tempvar = meow
[11:53:44] <jarr0dsz> i made a function reload() passing the groupID but have some problems with the reload timing
[11:53:48] <gaspyr> just do var temp = "" outside of everything and it's gonna be global
[11:53:50] <jarr0dsz> KolakCC1: and then you can just use it global? ok thx
[11:54:08] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: i loop over all the id from .timer class and set the groupID there..
[11:54:10] <Einzig> hmm
[11:54:16] <gaspyr> jarr0, javascript is function scoped, anything outside a function is global
[11:54:37] <jarr0dsz> i have .timer id="1,2,3,4,5,etc" so i have a   .each to loop true all of them then assign it to a groupID var
[11:54:49] <jarr0dsz> var groupID =  $(this).attr("id");
[11:54:50] <gaspyr> u forgot to complete ur attr() method
[11:55:05] <gaspyr> ah nvm u geting the value:D
[11:55:13] <jarr0dsz> but im not that good at jquery thats why i ask here for some expert advise ;p
[11:55:36] <gaspyr> the index u wrote is no use since u not using it
[11:55:38] <jarr0dsz> so inside the .each loop I could do something like window.groupID = ... ?
[11:55:54] <jarr0dsz> not? how could one improve it then the code seems pretty logic to me newbie eyes
[11:56:16] <gaspyr> yea pretty logic, but that index just facultative in ur case :)
[11:56:43] <gaspyr> passing the index or the e in event hadnlers is facultative if u dont need use it inside the function
[11:56:57] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: you mean like   $('.timer').each(function() { since index is not used
[11:57:01] <gaspyr> anyway, u wanna make those groupIDs global functions ?
[11:57:09] <gaspyr> yes exactly jarr0 :)
[11:57:33] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: not sure, i need to call a load with + groupID but im unable since the groupID is not have value outside the .each loop
[11:58:10] <gaspyr> set em as properties of the window object
[11:58:17] <jarr0dsz> so thats bascially the problem, now i made a reload(groupID); call inside the .each loop and a function called reload(groupID) {  alert("bla" + groupID); wich displays the id in an alert
[11:58:27] <gaspyr> or create an outside array and append to it the values of the ids with looping :)
[11:58:28] <jarr0dsz> okay just try that then
[11:58:37] <gaspyr> then u would need that inex parameter
[11:59:12] <gaspyr> var a = [] //outside
[11:59:12] <gaspyr> .each{     a[index] = groupID;        }
[12:01:48] <jarr0dsz> ok so I made it like this: http://pastie.org/4194639
[12:02:03] <jarr0dsz> only seems that only the first id="2" is grabbed from the id
[12:02:17] <jarr0dsz> so they are all the same now , the unique id of each .timer class is not grabbed, what am i missing
[12:02:45] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: try to keep it simple as im learning i could lateron refactor , just work no browser crash would be enough for now ;p
[12:02:46] <gaspyr> lol u didnt listen to me :D
[12:02:57] <gaspyr> i told u create an array and stock the values there
[12:02:59] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: not? missed something ;p
[12:03:21] <gaspyr> here u used only one variable ofc each time it will be overrrided :D
[12:03:26] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: and then? if i have the array how to call  the   $(".timer").load('/groups/' + window.groupID + '/get_time')}
[12:03:26] <jarr0dsz>    , 1000);
[12:03:44] <jarr0dsz> ok yes your right logic i see. I change it only not sure on the .load part though
[12:04:48] <Einzig> hey guys. I wonder if you can help with this http://jsfiddle.net/EjjVj/ I am trying to change the background image of menu items when clicked(selected) and deselect when another menu item is chosen.
[12:05:05] <aitiba_> hi
[12:05:22] <jarr0dsz> argh damn jquery is frustrating at times
[12:05:38] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: im not quite sure how to write the proposal lin the function i have now changed but its wrong
[12:05:47] <aitiba_> I have a select and with change event defined. When I select one option, the event is call two times
[12:05:56] <eph3meral> so it seems that I am not able to add a class to an SVG circle element, is this true?
[12:06:00] <aitiba_> http://pastebin.com/V1iynvnR somecan help me to only call one tie?
[12:06:04] <aitiba_> time*
[12:06:05] <eph3meral> I am able to add attributes, but not classes
[12:06:22] <jarr0dsz> something like http://pastie.org/private/icjnzz7wkz2mpsicmipnxq
[12:06:44] <eph3meral> at least, this is what the behavior seems to be
[12:06:44] <gaspyr> sry was afk, i chekin
[12:07:26] <eph3meral> $("svg circle").mouseover(function() { $(this).eq(0).addClass('foo'); }); <- seems to have no effect
[12:07:28] <eph3meral> wheras...
[12:07:53] <eph3meral> $("svg circle").mouseover(function() { $(this).eq(0).attr('foo', 'hello'); }); <- seems to work fine/as expected and desired?
[12:07:55] <gaspyr> :D cmon each is functon and u using braces my riend :), wait i rewrite for u :)
[12:11:27] <jarr0dsz> ok i fixed it in another way with the reload function again wich gets called on every .each loop
[12:11:36] <jarr0dsz> now only how would one get a .class  + an id ?
[12:11:56] <shoky> hlveheart: yo
[12:12:12] <jarr0dsz> like     $(".timer").load('/groups/' + groupID + '/get_time');  <<-- i need the ID inside that so I can say   $(".timer" with id ..
[12:14:57] <gaspyr> wait a sec pls im yting to paste it gives me an error
[12:14:58] <jarr0dsz> is there a way to add the ID to this $(".timer") ? im searching in docs but really no clue what command to use
[12:15:23] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: you mean me?
[12:15:34] <gaspyr> yes
[12:15:38] <gaspyr>     var a = [];
[12:15:39] <gaspyr>   
[12:15:39] <gaspyr>   var refreshId = setInterval(function(){
[12:15:39] <gaspyr>   $('.timer').each(function(index){
[12:15:39] <gaspyr>      var temp = $(this).attr("id");
[12:15:39] <gaspyr>      a[index] = temp;
[12:15:40] <gaspyr>   });
[12:15:40] <gaspyr>   //use for loop to loop over array and alert stuff
[12:15:40] <gaspyr>    //u edit this code
[12:15:41] <gaspyr>   $(".timer").load('/groups/' + window.groupID + '/get_time')}
[12:15:42] <gaspyr>    , 1000);
[12:15:53] <lancealtar> gaspyr: pastebin is your friend.
[12:15:55] <gaspyr> sry awful but ive some net prbs to upload it
[12:16:15] <gaspyr> i know, but it actually hattes me now :(
[12:16:24] <gaspyr> getting a server error
[12:16:28] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: i made it into this : http://pastie.org/private/583ajaahtom3plhgii8kg would love to hear what you think of that
[12:16:55] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: it works already almost ;p i only need to pass the ID to the .timer class when Im calling .load wich i have no clue on howto
[12:17:20] <gaspyr> http://jsfiddle.net/rSQeX/
[12:17:28] <jarr0dsz> idea is it will loop true all .timer classes, grabbs there id , calls the function reload(withtheID)
[12:17:34] <gaspyr> here is fiddle, please use instead of that pastebin :(
[12:17:45] <GreekFreak> I am successfully returning html after an ajax call, but the ajax call gives me a parse error
[12:18:27] <GreekFreak> Basically it fails instead of succeeding
[12:18:48] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: thx but what im not understand is you call the load with window.groupID but that groupID is no where set before?
[12:19:25] <gaspyr> my bad, but i did wrote a commenttary
[12:19:37] <gaspyr> said u edit that stuff, use for loop if u need it
[12:19:45] <gaspyr> just was lazy to rewrite all :)
[12:20:05] <gaspyr> didnt mean to get u confused
[12:20:20] <jarr0dsz> so you loop again true all the values of the array and pass the ID var into the .load call okay
[12:20:31] <jarr0dsz> now only then i have to see how to do that in jquery i get the idea ;p
[12:22:03] <gaspyr> jarr , just try wgatever u want then oaste if there's a prob we help as much as we can
[12:24:12] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: still dont get it totally :( something like http://jsfiddle.net/bck2r/1/ ?
[12:25:03] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: could you perhaps give me the solution so i can see what missing? the for loop is incorrect It hink in my code
[12:25:20] <gaspyr> checkin
[12:26:14] <Einzig> gaspyr:  I wonder if you can help with this http://jsfiddle.net/EjjVj/ I am trying to change the background image of menu items when clicked(selected) and deselect when another menu item is chosen.
[12:26:34] <gaspyr> whats the purpose of the second each looping ?
[12:27:15] <marcosmlopes> Hi, is there a way to retry an ajax request inside an ajaxError callback?
[12:27:49] <navaismo> Hello, I cant find in google(maybe im not searching with the right terms)how to display a table with the result of mysql query. I can do it from static query at page load, but i dont  understand how to load and the info dynamically. Any links would be appreciated
[12:27:50] <gaspyr> u r lacking a brace  einzing
[12:27:51] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: loop the results of the array but i guess its wrong
[12:28:05] <jarr0dsz> i cannot find a good example on how to loop an [a]index array ;s
[12:28:17] <gaspyr> yea totally wrong but easy to fix if thats wa u want
[12:28:54] <gaspyr> for(var p in a)  console.log(a[p]);
[12:29:18] <GreekFreak> Why would it give me a parse error when I am responding to ajax with valid html? (I have format set to html in tha ajax)
[12:29:33] <gaspyr> or for(var i=0; i<a.length; i++)  console ......
[12:31:12] <gaspyr> urgh wait , actually u wrote content outside of ready function, one sec iddle einzing
[12:32:02] <marcosmlopes> Hey guys, inside an ajax error callback that i receive when request times out i get an xhr object as parameter. This object has some method to retry the request?

[12:41:33] <jarr0dsz> now for another feature im in the need of getting a .class with id="x" I found this in docs but doesent work : $(".group\\[10\\])").empty(); should get <p class="group" id="x">bla</p> any idea whats missing?
[12:41:50] <jarr0dsz> hehe yeah sometimes those small jquery functions are hard to figure out if you dont know jquery that well
[12:43:49] <Aiwass> in jquery ui, can I set position of tabs, so I can have most tabs on the left side, but one-two tabs on the right side, with space between them?
[12:45:03] <gaspyr> einzing = http://jsfiddle.net/M4VfK/1/
[12:45:03] <marcosmlopes> i found what i'm looking for: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10024469/whats-the-best-way-to-retry-an-ajax-request-on-failure-using-jquery thanks anyway.
[12:47:13] <GreekFreak> why am i getting a parse error when I respond to an ajax $.post with html? I have the format set correctly to "html" and I am rendering a partial that I want displayed
[12:47:34] <jarr0dsz> gaspyr: do you might know how i could grabb .group with id="x" i need it for another feature
[12:48:19] <ravenzz> jarr0dsz IDs are unique
[12:48:35] <tw2113> except fake IDs
[12:48:36] <jarr0dsz> yes they are its not possible to grabb them?
[12:48:39] <tw2113> oh, wrong type
[12:48:47] <jarr0dsz> i have class="group" id="1" for example
[12:48:55] <ravenzz> #ID.group
[12:49:13] <jarr0dsz> then I want to do something like     $(".group" <<but only with id = 1 >>).css("border","3px solid red")
[12:49:17] <jarr0dsz> really have nooo idea
[12:49:25] <ravenzz> and ID cannot start with numbers
[12:49:41] <ravenzz> ?filter @ jarr0dsz
[12:49:42] <bot-t> jarr0dsz, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[12:49:59] <jarr0dsz> ah thx ravenzz i check
[12:51:13] <gaspyr> was afk sry
[12:51:45] <gaspyr> use a selector li this
[12:51:53] <gaspyr> *[id="1"]
[12:52:40] <gaspyr> u can also use filter method , many wats available
[12:53:29] <gaspyr> lmao, im dizzy :D, uh u need switch to class use :)

[12:58:26] <gaspyr> yes
[13:01:36] <windsurf_> Need an extra pair of eyes. I can't figure out why my jqXHR.fail isn't being called. From what I've read it should be available in jquery 1.7.2 http://pastebin.com/iZ46Z0y6
[13:02:18] <gaspyr> i need extra pair too :)
[13:03:35] <windsurf_> much simpler version: http://pastebin.com/m5HxAs0U
[13:03:55] <windsurf_> am i using the wrong version of jQuery / wrong syntax ? is that it?
[13:04:19] <windsurf_> done is the only one i can get to work (I turn my server off to test fail() )
[13:05:44] <GreekFreak> why am i getting a parse error when I respond to an ajax $.ajax with html? I have the format set correctly to "html" and I am rendering a partial that I want displayed. In addition, if I set the type to script, it responds and updates the page, but with $.ajax failure
[13:06:28] <shoky> windsurf_ your code is fine
[13:07:46] <windsurf_> shoky: ok thanks for the lead
[13:08:20] <shoky> windsurf_ like here http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fwMSF/4/
[13:08:27] <Progster> how can I return the results of a query as an object (i.e. an implicit hashtable?)
[13:08:31] <Progster> right now get returns an array
[13:09:09] <shoky> Progster: what would be the keys of this hashtable?
[13:09:29] <Progster> the entries in the array
[13:09:34] <Progster> I know them to be unique
[13:09:39] <shoky> those would be the entries, not the keys..
[13:09:48] <Progster> the entries of the array I want to be keys
[13:09:53] <shoky> huh?
[13:10:14] <shoky> there are keys and there are values
[13:10:21] <shoky> that's what a hashtable is, yes?
[13:10:21] <Progster> ['A', 'B', 'C'] => {A: "don't care", B: "don't care", C: "Don't care"}
[13:10:29] <shoky> wtf :\
[13:10:38] <Progster> just need fast lookup bc I know they're unique, i.e. a set
[13:10:49] <thang> ಠ_ಠ
[13:11:06] <Progster> a set doesn't care about the values. In Ruby for example, a set is implemented as a hashtable with the bool value true as the value for all keys
[13:12:10] <shoky> well, keys of a hashtable can only be strings
[13:12:14] <shoky> not objects
[13:12:21] <shoky> (in JS)
[13:12:26] <Progster> I believe my example supplied strings...
[13:12:31] <nFFF> Progster, but your query will reurn whatever your server returns,
[13:12:31] <shoky> but not your question
[13:12:43] <nFFF> so return an object container your keys/values
[13:13:10] <Progster> right now jQuery gives me an array of strings. I can run another loop and build the object myself. Is there a faster/built-in way of doing so?
[13:13:49] <nFFF> Progster, where are you gettings this array of strings, from an AJAX request?
[13:13:49] <shoky> gives you?
[13:14:18] <Progster> nFFF: I never mentioned doing an ajax request. It really should not matter for the purposes of this question, but it's a simple DOM query on items on the page.
[13:14:22] <jasonenglish> var data = [ {uid:…}, {uid:…}], hash = {}; hash[data[0].uid] = data[0]
[13:14:43] <shoky> Progster there is no faster way to turn an array of strings into a hashmap, loop it is.
[13:14:56] <shoky> afaik.
[13:15:01] <jasonenglish> ^^^
[13:15:19] <shoky> Progster a jquery DOM query does not give you an array of strings
[13:15:28] <shoky> it gives you a pseudo-array of DOM elements
[13:15:37] <shoky> wrapped in jquery goodness
[13:15:45] <windsurf_> shoky:  yeah your code works thanks. helpful
[13:16:02] <shoky> windsurf_ that's your code :P
[13:17:44] <windsurf_> shoky: actually it doesn't work when i use my url
[13:17:47] <windsurf_> vs your str
[13:18:05] <shoky> windsurf_ why are you expecting it to fail?
[13:18:23] <windsurf_> shoky: covering use case for when server is down and rebooting so i'll set a timeout and try again
[13:18:29] <shoky> windsurf_ are you saying that your always callback is called, but neither done or fail is called?
[13:18:48] <windsurf_> shoky: done works. when fail should work, it nor 'always' works.
[13:18:54] <shoky> huh
[13:19:00] <windsurf_> ok. it's apparently a xdomain thing
[13:19:21] <windsurf_> 'cause if i tweak my url to be the same domain as the current one that the client scripts are running on then i do get the callbacks
[13:19:29] <shoky> i'll ask again
[13:19:49] <shoky> is there a case (when you expect it to fail for example) where your 'always' callback is called, but NEITHER done NOR fail are called?
[13:20:06] <nFFF> is there ever a case?
[13:20:11] <shoky> of course not :)
[13:20:15] <windsurf_> shoky: no
[13:20:20] <shoky> windsurf_: then what's the problem?
[13:20:25] <nFFF> always seems pretty obsolete to me
[13:20:28] <shoky> windsurf_: if done is being called, fail shouldn't be being called
[13:20:41] <windsurf_> shoky: I expect a fail and fail is not getting called. neither is always
[13:21:00] <shoky> windsurf_: you expect a fail but a done is occuring instead. you might've mentioned this before :\
[13:21:13] <shoky> neither is always? oh.
[13:21:26] <windsurf_> right
[13:21:29] <shoky> so its not a problem with 'fail is not working'
[13:21:31] <shoky> :\
[13:21:53] <windsurf_> the crossdomain failure appears to interfere with subsequent callback handling
[13:22:46] <windsurf_> weird thing is the cross domain works when the server is up
[13:22:53] <windsurf_> so i don't know why it would care
[13:24:45] <otherj> anyone familiar with Masonry plugin?
[13:25:03] <jedimind> yes
[13:26:30] <otherj> jedimind: i'm loading it with bootstrap in a 'tab' and all of the left side absolute values are wrong. I'm using (window).load to call it. any idea what might cause that? this is based on my code (although it doesn't appear to be loading it correctly) http://jsfiddle.net/2fPnv/
[13:26:44] <otherj> so the result is that they're all stacked, but when i reload it looks fine
[13:27:22] <jedimind> there doesnt seem to be anything in that fiddle
[13:27:42] <otherj> http://jsfiddle.net/2fPnv/1/
[13:28:17] <otherj> that doesn't correctly represent the problem i'm seeing but it does give an idea of the code i'm using
[13:29:57] <otherj> what's weird is that it's clearly being called since the masonry positioning stuff is being added, but it's the wrong positioning. and a refesh fixes it
[13:30:52] <otherj> actually, opening and closing inspector seems to position things correctly too
[13:48:30] <istvan> hello all - i'm using jscrollpane ( https://dl.dropbox.com/u/769536/cluster/layout.html ) the "add" tab (hover to expand) has a scroll in it which in chrome works but in FF the jspContainer and jspPane have widths set to 0px. why is there a difference and how can I get the FF version to work?
[13:50:08] <cambazz> hello, how can i get the 7th parent? like i was doing .parent().parent. ... but
[13:50:15] <cambazz> i dont want to do it for 7 times
[13:51:12] <Progster> shoky: and then I call .get() or .toArray() on it and it returns an array.
[13:51:21] <Progster> is this really that hard to understand?
[13:52:21] <warrenparsons> cambazz: It's probably best to put a class on that element rather than trying to get it by context.
[14:02:52] <xarxer> I want to create an identifier such as "#content a" except for cases where "#content h1 > a".. Can this be done with :not?
[14:03:45] <GreekFreak> Thanks for all the help guys
[14:03:49] <GreekFreak> calling it a night :P
[14:04:31] <Ricaz> I have a problem.. My site doesn't work in IE and I don't know why. It should do an ajax call (works fine in chrome). Site: www.klinik-m.dk - ajax call: http://pastebin.com/Qm25ayFQ
[14:08:13] <Grundell> if i have two divs (div1 / div2 ) can i in an easy way change position on them both so they display div2 div1  ?

[14:15:23] <pflock> is there any way to just click on a point on the screen or the browser and get the color code?
[14:15:28] <pflock> or a function?
[14:15:52] <sente> pflock: if it's on an image, yes
[14:15:56] <sente> (that i know of)
[14:16:01] <sente> if it's not, i don't think it's so easy
[14:16:06] <pflock> sente: yes it is!
[14:16:10] <pflock> sente: how?
[14:16:39] <pflock> sente: And either way you could just make a screenshot of your site and then you would have an image :)
[14:17:03] <sente> heh yeah, been there, done that
[14:17:18] <pflock> sente: and how do I get the code now?
[14:17:25] <sente> look at http://sente.cc/scripts/aptus/aptus.py
[14:17:39] <sente> you can figure out the x,y coordinate of the click
[14:17:42] <sente> once you do that
[14:17:50] <sente> you can create an Canvas element
[14:17:51] <sente> from the image
[14:17:56] <sente> and then look at that pixel
[14:19:10] <sente> sorry i dont have more convenient code handy
[14:19:11] <sente> heh
[14:19:34] <sente> http://colorpart.com/cropit.html might also be useful
[14:19:41] <sente> uses some of the same code
[14:19:51] <sente> at some point i will have single page with more than 1 feature
[14:20:18] <pflock> thanks
[14:23:52] <sente> pflock: it would also be easy to make a GET request to the server like "server.com/get_pixel?x=32&y=100&url=http://imgur.com/image.jpg"
[14:24:03] <sente> the get_pixel server side code is practically a one-liner
[14:24:26] <sente> and the jquery to send the request is super simple, because the click event contains all the necessary info
[14:25:32] <pflock> i just found a perfect firefox plugin
[14:25:50] <pflock> that has nearly every function for colors I ever needed :)
[14:30:18] <wathek> Hi everybody

[15:00:36] <granden> jedimind: Yeah, but. Then it would create a new default stylesheet for my.
[15:00:48] <granden> I only want another stylesheet for ONE of my ui elements.
[15:01:28] <jedimind> overwrite the default style by just using some CSS
[15:01:37] <jedimind> if you dont know how to do that, how to target those elements, try #css
[15:01:38] <ryanneufeld> granden: then you can add a custom class to that element
[15:01:48] <ryanneufeld> and then use that class to change the properties you want
[15:03:10] <granden> hmm
[15:04:02] <granden> if I use the themeroller to create an stylesheet that got all the correct values for my buttons
[15:04:12] <granden> how do I find only those parts in those css?
[15:17:25] <Flavius1924> can you tell me why i can not see the alert message in here ?
[15:17:30] <Flavius1924> http://jsfiddle.net/MNXPe/1/
[15:20:35] <shoky> Progster: still, that is not an array of strings, that's an array of DOM elements. is THAT so hard to get?
[15:22:33] <shoky> Flavius1924: you have html in your javascript, for one
[15:23:01] <shoky> Flavius1924: and you are referencing an undefined variable 'ceva'
[15:23:27] <shoky> Flavius1924: and you are referncing a non existent jquery method .alert() ...
[15:23:43] <shoky> Flavius1924: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/MNXPe/7/
[15:23:58] <styol> Any random ideas why .live('click', function(){}) might not work as expected? I am not able to replicate the issue in jsfiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/x9Fzw/) and am unable to share the literal example, so I'm hunting for clues as to why it would not work without error, warning, etc. A key note is that jQuery 1.3.2 is in use by requirement.
[15:24:13] <Ricaz> I have a problem.. My site doesn't work in IE and I don't know why. It should do an ajax call, but it doesn't happen (works fine in chrome). Site: www.klinik-m.dk - ajax call: http://pastebin.com/Qm25ayFQ
[15:24:19] <shoky> 1.3.2 lol.
[15:24:44] <styol> shoky: that is safely updated to the max also haha.. first issue was live is undefined ;)
[15:25:22] <suedoh> Hello, if there is an available jQuery consultant, please private message me.
[15:25:40] <suedoh> Need some help with jQuery-UI and jQueryMobile.
[15:25:42] <suedoh> Thanks
[15:28:28] <[fields]> what is the best strategy for forms that don't cause page change?  to not even put <input>'s inside of a <form> ?  or to always use a <form> but make sure onsubmit="return false;" ?
[15:29:47] <shoky> Ricaz: works fine for me
[15:30:06] <Ricaz> shoky yes, sorry, I have no idea why it works now
[15:30:11] <Ricaz> or rather, why it didn't before
[15:30:34] <shoky> :P
[15:32:07] <shoky> [fields] bind to the form submit event, and call event.preventDefault() in your handler. e.g. $('form').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); /* ... do stuff ... */ });
[15:32:40] <[fields]> interesting
[15:40:10] <thomedy> can i share the progressi have made to my site there are still things im working on but its getting stronger
[15:41:39] <zanberdo> how can I write a routine which acts on all <td> elements with an id that begins with 'foo' (I have three td's labeled foofoo, foobar, and foobaz) and need to do something when the content of the cell changes.
[15:44:04] <shoky> zanberdo: $('td[id^=foo]')
[15:46:09] <zanberdo> shoky, thanks, I just figured that out. :)
[15:46:28] <zanberdo> sorry, that reads snarky. I am serious with the thanks and I'm just observing that I just this minute found that out. :)
[15:47:21] <shoky> you didn't say 'but' so it's all good :P
[15:57:33] <thomedy> hello, and then an echo
[16:01:18] <shoky> thomedy plz can i see ur site plz plz
[16:02:48] <thomedy> okay
[16:02:50] <thomedy> yay
[16:02:55] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[16:03:11] <thomedy> its not quite there yet
[16:03:15] <thomedy> but im getting closer
[16:03:22] <thomedy> its a tremendous load time still
[16:05:55] <styol> thomedy: those 4 main images alone are like 1.7mb out of 1.85mb of the page size
[16:06:58] <thomedy> yeah i have to google how to keep a solid image and keep load times efficient
[16:07:04] <thomedy> cuz i love my design
[16:07:19] <shoky> animation is a bit jumpy sometimes
[16:07:32] <thomedy> yeah i really dont know what to do about that right now
[16:07:43] <thomedy> it was better without the images
[16:07:49] <thomedy> but i like my images
[16:07:53] <thomedy> the design is solid
[16:08:01] <thomedy> so i gotta make the rest of it work
[16:08:16] <thomedy> and i googled seo about how my site is setup and for the most part im good
[16:08:36] <styol> thomedy: commonly it is dependent on how you save the images and their compression/quality etc.. these are jpg's so you can reduce the quality to reduce the file size. I usually start at 65%
[16:08:49] <thomedy> these are dummy images too
[16:08:53] <thomedy> i grabbed them off google
[16:09:04] <thomedy> im scheduling a photo shoot tha ti can use
[16:09:12] <thomedy> cuz im affraid of getting sued
[16:09:35] <thomedy> so in the end result im going to whiten the images a bit so the content wont be hard to see
[16:09:37] <shoky> too many things are animating
[16:09:39] <styol> there are stock image places where you can purchase images to use with appropriate rights
[16:09:52] <thomedy> $$ i only have so much money
[16:10:39] <styol> thomedy: also you should turn on drupal css/jss aggregation ;)
[16:10:45] <styol> *js
[16:10:47] <thomedy> oh that will help for sure
[16:10:51] <thomedy> but i forgot about that...
[16:11:01] <styol> did you end up checking out easing?
[16:11:02] <thomedy> let me do that right now i have never done that
[16:11:06] <thomedy> i didn't really like it
[16:11:20] <thomedy> but i appreciate the jsfiddle thing you made
[16:11:27] <thomedy> its solid i just dont like the bounce
[16:11:41] <styol> i dont think i did but i just recommended checking out easing, wasnt sure if that would help or hurt the jumpyness
[16:11:58] <styol> bounce would be one of many many options in easing
[16:12:06] <thomedy> i saw a bunch
[16:12:09] <thomedy> i do appreciate it
[16:12:27] <thomedy> before i forget e.preventDefault() doesnt' work in ie
[16:13:12] <styol> shoky: turns out another click handler was being assigned that returns false or something which breaks live, unbin('click') first made things work properly
[16:13:20] <styol> *unbind
[16:14:10] <shoky> it doesn't break live ;P
[16:14:27] <shoky> it breaks propagation of the event
[16:14:34] <thomedy> is this a dialogue between the two of you about my code... cuz iff so.. i would love to be better
[16:14:43] <shoky> thomedy nope :P
[16:14:55] <shoky> thomedy: i dont like how you're animating stuff
[16:14:56] <thomedy> good
[16:14:57] <shoky> for example
[16:15:07] <shoky> ah nvm i misread your code
[16:15:16] <shoky> sry ;P
[16:15:19] <thomedy> wait so im good
[16:15:22] <thomedy> what just happened
[16:15:29] <shoky> nothing , carry on ;]
[16:16:52] <shoky> thomedy: not that it'll make the animations smoother, but you should really cache your jquery objects and not re-query the DOM all the time
[16:17:49] <shoky> meaning , on page load do: var mensOverflowColor = $('#mens-overflow-color')   and then just use mensOverflowColor instead of calling $() all the time
[16:18:33] <thomedy> will htat be more efficient
[16:18:59] <thomedy> i was googling how to aggregate css and js
[16:19:05] <thomedy> i just saw stuff
[16:19:07] <shoky> yes
[16:19:22] <styol> thomedy: it is a core feature of drupal under Performance
[16:19:34] <thomedy> thank you by the way
[16:19:54] <thomedy> so i turn all elements i call consistently witha  () then i speed up my page
[16:19:56] <thomedy> thank you
[16:20:00] <thomedy> is that what it means to cache
[16:20:04] <thomedy> i have to google that too
[16:20:07] <thomedy> dang so much to learn
[16:20:18] <thomedy> but im going to rock this site so hard
[16:21:02] <thomedy> okay that seems key im goign to do those 2 things and then go back to tweaking making sure everything is tight
[16:23:01] <thomedy> holy crap that already sped up everything
[16:26:55] <shoky> jeez he's with jquery 1.3.2
[16:31:11] <thomedy> sorry im back
[16:31:15] <thomedy> i have no idea what happened
[16:31:22] <thomedy> but im back rewriting my ()'s
[16:45:23] <shoky> thomedy: aren't you setting up the mouseenter and mouseleave handlers  twice ?
[16:46:02] <shoky> thomedy: once after $(window).resize
[16:46:13] <shoky> thomedy: another time inside $(window).load
[16:49:43] <thomedy> im glad i came back i love your guys's knowledge
[16:51:12] <thomedy> i hope its not to late to respond to taht comment earlier i keep getting booted for some reason
[16:51:31] <thomedy> crap now i dont reember i was asked if im setting up something twice
[16:51:43] <shoky> thomedy did you see what i asked?
[16:51:49] <shoky> [02:45:25] <shoky> thomedy: aren't you setting up the mouseenter and mouseleave handlers  twice ?
[16:51:49] <shoky> [02:46:04] <shoky> thomedy: once after $(window).resize
[16:51:49] <shoky> [02:46:15] <shoky> thomedy: another time inside $(window).load
[16:51:52] <thomedy> i did i just cant remember after refreshing
[16:51:56] <thomedy> oh yes i am
[16:52:06] <thomedy> because i am setting it up onload and on hashchange
[16:52:14] <thomedy> for covering all bases
[16:52:21] <shoky> so you're setting the event handlers twice, meaning both of them will be called on mouseenter/mouseleave, meaning you're calling animate TWICE
[16:52:35] <shoky> i'd say that could me a major source for jumpy animations ;P
[16:52:38] <shoky> be*
[16:52:45] <thomedy> okay... actually from what i can tell
[16:52:50] <thomedy> changing all the $()
[16:52:59] <thomedy> for the mouse enters have already helped a bunch
[16:53:01] <thomedy> i havent finished yet
[16:53:13] <thomedy> is () mean im running some major code every time
[16:53:19] <shoky> ok but dont set the same event handlers twice :\ especially not if you run animations in them
[16:53:29] <shoky> that should be your major concern now i think.
[16:53:32] <thomedy> my concern is this
[16:53:42] <thomedy> if i dont have it in hash change and load
[16:53:50] <shoky> if you want to re-bind
[16:53:54] <shoky> then at least unbind first
[16:53:58] <thomedy> ohhh
[16:53:59] <thomedy> yeah
[16:54:08] <thomedy> waiti do unbind
[16:54:16] <shoky> it's a must
[16:54:23] <thomedy> i actually do have an unbind
[16:54:29] <thomedy> but now i know that bind's chain
[16:54:44] <shoky> when i load your page and run this in the console: $('#mens-overflow-color').data('events').mouseenter
[16:54:53] <shoky> you can see the two event handlers bound
[16:54:59] <shoky> that is very bad :P
[16:55:01] <thomedy> what how are yo doing that
[16:55:04] <thomedy> okay thank you
[16:55:11] <shoky> how am i doing what?
[16:55:13] <shoky> typing in the console?
[16:55:19] <thomedy> firebug console
[16:55:21] <shoky> sure
[16:55:26] <shoky> im on chrome, but same thing
[16:55:29] <thomedy> crap im so not smart
[16:55:35] <coldhead> no one is
[16:55:35] <thomedy> ive got so much to learn this is awesome
[16:55:45] <thomedy> okay so you see 2 handlers
[16:55:48] <thomedy> thats fixable
[16:55:55] <shoky> just unbind before you bind
[16:55:57] <thomedy> i thought i had them unbound by leaving
[16:56:00] <thomedy> the front page
[16:56:04] <thomedy> ill have to figure this out
[16:56:11] <shoky> it's a single-page app
[16:56:12] <thomedy> but so much thank yous
[16:56:16] <thomedy> right
[16:56:19] <thomedy> im sorry changing hash
[16:56:31] <shoky> yeah, that wont unbind any handlers ;P
[16:56:36] <shoky> but even without hashchange
[16:56:40] <shoky> you are doing it twice on page load
[16:58:08] <thomedy> okay i just figure dthis out
[16:58:14] <thomedy> that was only there cuz i thought i erased it
[16:58:16] <thomedy> and ididn't
[16:58:18] <thomedy> i have one on load
[16:58:21] <thomedy> and one on ready
[16:58:26] <thomedy> cuz m y original code had it on ready
[16:58:34] <thomedy> i switched it to onload i cant rmember why
[16:58:37] <thomedy> but it should be gone now
[16:58:40] <thomedy> i thought i was gone already
[16:58:42] <thomedy> thank you
[16:59:33] <shoky> it's not gone ;P
[16:59:50] <thomedy> dang it
[16:59:53] <thomedy> i thought i had it
[17:00:02] <raj> don't wory, I'm back

[17:02:41] <thomedy> i think my design is solid once i click in these details
[17:12:14] <scr3am> hi guys...
[17:14:45] <scr3am> learned something new today, .fadeTo() ;-) what a shame
[17:19:02] <joikus> hi you guys
[17:20:37] <joikus> I am using jquery validation plugin, my client originally wanted this textbox to be at least 2 characters long so I did $("#venueName").rules("add", { minlength: 2 ...
[17:21:03] <joikus> works perfectly, but now he wants at least 2 characters long, AND one character must be a letter
[17:21:06] <joikus> any suggestions ?
[17:24:26] <shoky> joikus i think you'd need to add a validation method
[17:24:53] <mrkhat> Is there a simple way to merge two hashes?
[17:25:56] <joikus> shoky ya im looking for the syntax for that
[17:26:20] <shoky> joikus: smth like:  $.validator.addMethod("oneCharIsLetter", function(value, element) { return /[a-z]/i.test(value) })
[17:26:27] <beefz0r> hello
[17:26:32] <beefz0r> I'm completely new to jquery
[17:26:45] <beefz0r> and I want to train using examples
[17:27:18] <Es0teric> shoky, have you seen this? https://github.com/mattdiamond/fuckitjs/
[17:27:22] <beefz0r> can someone modify some code for me ?
[17:27:41] <shoky> Es0teric yeah i linked it here too a while ago :P
[17:27:54] <shoky> beefz0r don't ask to ask :P
[17:27:55] <Es0teric> LOLLL
[17:28:02] <Es0teric> man.. that guy is pretty funny
[17:28:10] <shoky> yap ;>
[17:28:26] <shoky> window.fuckingDeferred ;D
[17:28:55] <Es0teric> lmao

[17:29:13] <beefz0r> sorry if I'm a noob lawl
[17:29:34] <shoky> everyone's a noob at some point
[17:29:43] <beefz0r> well
[17:29:45] <Es0teric> im far from noob
[17:29:48] <Es0teric> but i was a noob
[17:30:01] <beefz0r> that link, I want the same but instead of hover, on click
[17:30:04] <beefz0r> what do I need to change?
[17:30:24] <joikus> shoky: yes the setup worked, I am able to addMethod np
[17:30:34] <shoky> ?$.extend @ mrkhat
[17:30:36] <bot-t> mrkhat, jQuery.extend() - Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[17:30:39] <beefz0r> wait I did something very bad, I'll try again lol
[17:31:01] <mrkhat> Thank you! Just found it in the documentation myself, kept running into .merge which is for arrays
[17:31:03] <joikus> ya sweetness
[17:31:11] <shoky> beefz0r: you know jsfiddle?
[17:31:28] <beefz0r> yea I tried changing hover but I forgot something
[17:33:38] <joikus> shoky: thanks
[17:33:49] <beefz0r> I tried changing $('#nav li').hover( to $('#nav li').mouseup(
[17:33:50] <beefz0r> but nothing
[17:33:57] <shoky> np joikus
[17:34:18] <shoky> beefz0r .hover binds 2 seperate events
[17:34:28] <beefz0r> oh
[17:34:37] <shoky> beefz0r so it's a bit different than others like mouseup or click
[17:34:38] <beefz0r> I don't really get it
[17:34:54] <shoky> hover is a shortcut for .mouseover and .mouseout  or something
[17:35:12] <shoky> beefz0r:  $('#nav li').mouseup( your_handler_function_here )l;
[17:35:19] <shoky> without that l ;P
[17:35:26] <beefz0r> okay I got it
[17:35:55] <shoky> if you want clicks then use .click instead of .mouseup
[17:36:04] <beefz0r> what does $ do ?
[17:36:06] <beefz0r> I don't get it
[17:38:56] <shoky> beefz0r running $( selector_string )  searches the page's DOM tree for elements matching the selector, and returns to you a 'jquery object' which wraps the selected elements so you can call all the jquery methods on it
[17:39:16] <shoky> (and $ is just an alias for jQuery)
[17:39:30] <shoky> so it's just a function called jQuery
[17:39:52] <beefz0r> what is the selector exactly ?
[17:40:29] <shoky> have you read the jquery tutorials?
[17:40:32] <thursday1> http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works
[17:41:01] <beefz0r> not really lol
[17:41:13] <beefz0r> I just like to try some shit out
[17:41:36] <beefz0r> that way I learned C#, some php, some javascript
[17:41:43] <shoky> well, now i have 0 motivation to help you.
[17:42:39] <beefz0r> nah I was just wondering
[17:42:46] <shoky> obviously you dont learn just by "trying some shit out", because you had to come here and start asking noob questions
[17:42:58] <shoky> so save us the effort and go RTFM
[17:43:15] <beefz0r> I'm sorry dude
[17:43:21] <shoky> then if you still have questions, ask by all means
[17:43:32] <beefz0r> I just wanted to try jquery out before I learn it
[17:43:45] <shoky> then why did you come here and ask questions?
[17:43:48] <beefz0r> I have no idea wether its worth it or not
[17:43:52] <shoky> you could spend that precious time trying more shit out
[17:43:57] <beefz0r> well I wanted to see how flexible it was
[17:44:05] <shoky> then rtfm :\
[17:44:10] <beefz0r> lol ye I will
[17:44:15] <shoky> im not saying read the whole API docs
[17:44:29] <shoky> but you need to know the basics before trying shit out.
[17:45:06] <beefz0r> yea I will
[17:45:16] <beefz0r> I did google for that dollarsign by the way
[17:45:25] <beefz0r> I didn't find a simple explanation
[17:45:36] <shoky> thursday1 was gracious enough to give you a link. no google necessary
[17:46:33] <beefz0r> okay
[17:47:05] <scr3am> shoky: always that s**t word =-O
[17:47:09] <beefz0r> I changed the hover thingy, when you click you either slide it down or u
[17:47:21] <beefz0r> I love how flexible it is
[17:47:24] <shoky> scr3am: me? he started it :P
[17:47:35] <scr3am> ahh, i oversaw
[17:47:47] <shoky> anyway what's wrong with the s**t word
[17:48:23] <scr3am> actually nothing, just wanted you to... whatever, senseless ;-)
[17:48:40] <shoky> ok i'll do my best
[17:49:15] <shoky> ;dZ:dZD:zD:ZD:Z;z
[17:49:16] <scr3am> perfect, actually i don't really care, except my code won't work...
[17:49:49] <shoky> swear some at it
[17:50:23] <scr3am> ?
[17:50:29] <shoky> no idea
[17:51:17] <scr3am> read about jQ_2.0... makes me happy...
[17:51:56] <shoky> so happy you could just scr3am
[17:52:15] <scr3am> even if i guess a lot of will stick with the 1.9 version, hahaha
[17:52:43] <scr3am> shoky: that's shokyng...
[17:53:05] <shoky> well i just talked here with 2 people using 1.3.2
[17:53:18] <shoky> so i have to agree wioth you ;p
[17:55:12] <scr3am> hard to imagine in the "always the latest and greatest" times...
[17:57:08] <scr3am> just did a test with 1.3.2 and felt i reached nearly 100%, actually got nearly 70%, i was shocked...
[17:57:45] <shoky> % of what?
[17:58:18] <scr3am> answering questions...
[17:58:19] <shoky> nirvana?
[17:58:22] <scr3am> freel...
[17:58:32] <shoky> ohh that kind of test
[17:58:37] <scr3am> ;-)
[18:01:00] <scr3am> i talked with some guy about spagetti code in JQ, but unfortunately i can not remember his name anymore... so sad
[18:01:25] <scr3am> so if you read this and feel like, moment could be me....
[18:02:25] <crazyzf> hi i only want to change the first span...look here http://jsfiddle.net/2TRRE/
[18:03:36] <scr3am> crazyzf: outside the a-tag, right?
[18:03:54] <crazyzf> inside
[18:04:45] <scr3am> give a class/id -> $('whatever > a').html();
[18:04:58] <scr3am> give A-tag...
[18:05:17] <scr3am> $('whatever > span').html();
[18:05:19] <scr3am> of course
[18:05:45] <crazyzf> whatever? u mean i should put the span in a class?
[18:06:18] <scr3am> no, the parent <a> should get a class or something and this is then "whatever"
[18:06:26] <DX-Mac> Has anyone ever had an issue with Jquery UI referencing the css file but not working? I've disabled all plugins and the issue still continues. Chrome javascript debugger shows it's referencing everything correctly and even shows me where the calendar dropout window is but it's not showing any text.
[18:06:44] <crazyzf> ok ty i will try
[18:07:00] <DX-Mac> remove the css file and the jquery ui works correctly (just not very pretty)
[18:07:22] <scr3am> $('whatever > a:first').html();   should it be
[18:07:46] <crazyzf> scr3am this change all spans in a
[18:07:51] <scr3am> $('whatever > span:first').html();   should it be
[18:08:00] <crazyzf> i only want to exchange the first span
[18:08:07] <crazyzf> thanks
[18:08:07] <scr3am> i forgot first
[18:08:14] <crazyzf> thats it
[18:08:28] <crazyzf> im little drunk
[18:08:58] <scr3am> and i'm confused somehow if see my typing...
[18:09:24] <crazyzf> :)
[18:10:37] <scr3am> crazyzf: what means "Gecheckt"?
[18:11:21] <crazyzf> it means checked an entry
[18:11:33] <crazyzf> its german
[18:11:36] <scr3am> language? sounds familiar
[18:11:46] <scr3am> cool 8-)
[18:18:22] <defaultro> hey folks, how to troubleshoot javascript using firebug if javascript file is unknown?
[18:21:03] <xene> hey guys, random code structure question...
[18:21:11] <xene> i'm working on a utility class and want to use a function from one sub-utility in another sub-utility
[18:21:17] <xene> here's a snippet: http://pastebin.com/index/Y0eG77nx
[18:21:24] <xene> am i approaching this the wrong way, or is there some way i can cleanly gain access to Utils.math.clamp() inside Utils.geometry?
[18:24:34] <danzik17> xene: you probably want to look at something like RequireJS for dependency management if you want to separate these out into modules like util/math and util/geometry
[18:26:48] <xboi209> if i had 3 div tags with same class names, how would i get jquery to select the first, second, or third one?
[18:27:17] <danzik17> xboi209: see ?eq
[18:27:17] <bot-t> xboi209, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[18:27:33] <xboi209> k ty
[18:29:10] <xene> hrm, okay. thanks danzik
[18:31:22] <squeakita> hi All, bare with me as I am very much a noob, when it comes to jquery. I am using the live form validation plugin , http://www.geektantra.com/2009/10/update-for-jquery-live-form-validation-plugin/ everything is working as expected, except i have a very long form, and the form appears broken, the form is not scrolling to the first error - can anyone lend a hand?
[18:43:35] <xboi209> how would i display the value of an alt attribute of an image?
[18:45:28] <xboi209> anyone?
[18:53:24] <Lobosque> I'm trying to load Json from a page with getJson. when I load from the original file it works, but when I try in a exact copy, but in my website, it does not. I'm setting the header to serve json. what could it be?
[18:54:11] <coldhead> can you pastebin the code, Lobosque ?
[18:54:33] <Lobosque> coldhead sure
[18:56:16] <coldhead> thanks babe
[18:57:37] <elrond255> all the examples of loading content into a page using .load have it loading into a div, is there any issue if I choose to load it into a HTML5  article for better semantics?
[18:57:44] <Lobosque> coldhead this is what I'm using
[18:57:47] <Lobosque> http://pastebin.com/wNjQRm0z
[18:57:49] <Lobosque> (don't work)
[18:57:53] <coldhead> go nuts, elrond255
[18:58:00] <coldhead> it won't matter
[18:58:12] <coldhead> it would suck if divs were required :P
[18:58:24] <Lobosque> this is the original data (works): http://www.highcharts.com/samples/data/jsonp.php?filename=aapl-ohlcv.json&callback=?'
[18:58:30] <elrond255> I've seen weirder things in these internets of ours
[18:58:38] <elrond255> thank you coldhead
[18:59:13] <coldhead> Lobosque: i actually meant the getJSON code BUT try loading your data into a browser and copy/pasting it into jsonlint
[18:59:23] <coldhead> http://jsonlint.com/
[18:59:38] <coldhead> if it doesn't validate there you'll need to massage it until it does
[18:59:58] <elrond255> and a related questions, if the pages loaded have jquery scripts of their own then they should still work if I load them into a page that has already loaded jquery? do I need to load query twice?
[18:59:58] <coldhead> i don't think comments are allowed in JSON
[19:00:06] <Lobosque> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/Wbq4T/98/
[19:00:14] <Lobosque> try chaning the url to mine, it won't work.
[19:00:36] <coldhead> Lobosque: you can't load JSON from another domain
[19:01:04] <coldhead> you need to use JSONP
[19:01:28] <coldhead> ?getJSON
[19:01:28] <bot-t> jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[19:01:36] <coldhead> search for JSONP
[19:02:52] <coldhead> guh you are using jsonp
[19:02:58] * coldhead tries to do do much at once
[19:04:12] <coldhead> Lobosque: which is the URL you're trying to load from?
[19:04:33] <coldhead> the one that isn't http://www.highcharts.com/samples/data/jsonp.php?filename=aapl-ohlcv.json&callback=? and which doesn't wrk
[19:07:27] <defaultro> hey folks, what is $('#submit-result') mean from the line    if ($('#submit-result').length > -1) { ...... }
[19:08:07] <Lobosque> coldhead www.lucaslobosque.com/test/json
[19:09:17] <coldhead> Lobosque: you need to replace the ? with a function name
[19:09:27] <coldhead> and then tell jQuery to call that function
[19:11:32] <coldhead> Lobosque: it doesn't look like you can specify the callback name to .getJSON
[19:11:39] <coldhead> so you'll need to use .ajax()
[19:11:44] <coldhead> ?getjson
[19:11:44] <bot-t> jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[19:12:03] <coldhead> there's a description there of the .ajax() call which .getJSON is a shortcut to
[19:12:05] <coldhead> start with that
[19:13:14] <coldhead> Lobosque: here's some similar code http://stackoverflow.com/questions/203194/using-a-named-function-as-the-callback-for-getjson-in-jquery-to-satisfy-facebo
[19:13:23] <coldhead> are you feeling me?
[19:16:25] <Lobosque> coldhead thank you =]
[19:16:26] <fedya> does anyone know how to mark a field valid with the validator plugin from a callback? i'm using a custom ajax validation method so it can't return true for an invalid field or false for valid
[19:17:24] <coldhead> Lobosque: the problem is that jQuery replaces the '?' with a random function name, which it supplies to the server via callback=whatever. then when the data returns it calls "whatever()"
[19:17:51] <coldhead> and if you're not going to support the callback= param yourself you need to hardcode the function name in the JSONP and tell jQuery what to call yourself <3
[19:18:34] <hye> hi
[19:18:35] <fedya> i'm looking through the source for jquery.validate.js and haven't yet found how to mark something valid. I've tried validator.showErrors({"Email": false}); delete validator.invalid["Email"]; the show errors false hides the error but the form won't submit now, i'm thinking the submit method is checking another error list
[19:19:38] <coldhead> fedya: i would try using the custom validation methods as seen in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11126938/jquery-custom-validation
[19:19:43] <hye> I am having a calculator formula that pours a ton of variables into javascript for number crunching.  additionally I can do this same formula on the server side.  which is better front-end calculations (uses no additional bandwidth, but calculates on the front-end) or server side (always uses bandwidth through ajax calls, potentially slowler)
[19:20:05] <hye> these calculations constantly change depending on user selections
[19:20:39] <coldhead> if it's sensitive to the user's choices its probably better to do it in the browser, hye
[19:20:45] <coldhead> keeps your server costs down, too
[19:20:56] <fedya> i was also thinking overriding the obsubmit callback where it would check validator.invalid
[19:21:02] <coldhead> the only reason i'd move it to the server if it's absolutely browser choking
[19:21:13] <fedya> coldhead: i think the link you sent it for dependent rules
[19:21:26] <hye> coldhead the browser can handle it, although its heavy, but so many variables to manage in the browser, is it worth it?
[19:21:33] <fedya> my form doesn't submit when validation works
[19:21:43] <hye> think of like minimum 4,000 variables
[19:21:49] <fedya> but it was submitting with an invalid email oddly enough
[19:22:28] <coldhead> fedya: are you perhaps misusing the plugin?
[19:22:45] <coldhead> i'd just add whatever rules i need, validate with them and let the plugin work as it should
[19:23:00] <coldhead> when you're talking about overwriting the submit handler that rings alarm bells
[19:23:23] <coldhead> hye: if you have to do the calculations SOMEWHERE why not make it happen in the browser?
[19:23:29] <fedya> i don't think so
[19:23:31] <defaultro> hey folks, what is $('#submit-result') mean from the line    if ($('#submit-result').length > -1) { ...... }
[19:23:36] <coldhead> unless you're supporting users with noJS
[19:23:46] <defaultro> is it a function?
[19:23:50] <coldhead> fedya: want to pastebin your code somewhere?
[19:23:52] <fedya> it doesn't look like you can override the on submit handler
[19:23:54] <fedya> yes
[19:24:09] <coldhead> defaultro: it's testing if that element exists
[19:24:15] <fedya> i actually have some pretty crazy custom validations working, but they're not marking the fields valid when they validate
[19:24:16] <defaultro> k
[19:24:21] <hye> coldhead well i have to do it outside the browser anyway because of people messing with the js code and submitting invalid stuff.  but front-end is more complex to handle it, then back-end, dont know if it weighs the benefits, i think front-end will be alot faster than constant ajax calls
[19:24:26] <coldhead> $('body').length === 1, $('#no-exist').length === 0
[19:25:05] <fedya> i tried to work around the fact that my custom validation method can't return by setting validator.invalid.field_name = false and that seemed to work, but if i have on submit: true it won't submit if i have on submit false then it will allow an invalid email through
[19:25:19] <coldhead> hye: #jQuery will probably disagree that the clientside is "more complex" :)
[19:25:35] <coldhead> hye: there's no one rule, it comes down to a matter of requirements and taste
[19:25:36] <fedya> so this is like a last dilemma here before it's fully working, i though the validator.invalid.field = false was a good solution
[19:26:11] <coldhead> fedya: it's good if it works, but it's not the way validate() is intended to be used
[19:26:15] <fedya> coldhead: http://pastebin.com/VBgh8P2p
[19:26:17] <coldhead> unless you're a power user, i guess
[19:26:20] <coldhead> i am not a power user
[19:26:38] <tw2113> coldhead secretly uses mootools
[19:26:59] <fedya> hm well i'm having to do some power user stuff without being a 100% expert
[19:27:38] <fedya> because i'm calling an ajax validation method which and because it's async the two custom validation methods that are ajax can't return
[19:27:59] <fedya> so they call the onSuccess callback that's part of that tower data thing
[19:28:02] <coldhead> ack, this is hardcore, fedya :)
[19:28:19] <fedya> yea… lol it is
[19:28:32] <coldhead> fedya: i would post this to forum.jquery.com, i believe the validate() author hangs out there
[19:28:44] <fedya> though i've become an expert at validator, i could write some crazy validations the easy what that you're talking about
[19:28:50] <fedya> unfortunately i can't quite get this one working
[19:29:00] <coldhead> you can also paste the link to your post here while you wait
[19:29:12] <fedya> i'm having to modify validators internal error map when my ajax calls returns a valid response
[19:29:18] <coldhead> hardcore
[19:29:22] <coldhead> i would never do that
[19:29:23] <defaultro> what likely could be the reason why a link doesn't work on first load of the page but works once the webpage is reloaded? The code is http://pastebin.com/1gQ2cSqH
[19:29:28] <coldhead> i would just go and sob quietly in the corner
[19:29:43] <fedya> i don't see much get answered on forums.jquery.com
[19:29:47] <fedya> i'll try stackoverflow
[19:30:01] <fedya> i found one similar question and it hasn't been answered since last year
[19:30:50] <coldhead> defaultro: the code might not be wrapped in .ready() ?
[19:31:00] <coldhead> and it works the 2nd time because of caching
[19:31:03] <defaultro> yes
[19:31:04] <coldhead> that's my best guess
[19:31:16] <defaultro> i didn't write the code that's why I am having so much hard time figuring it out
[19:31:26] <defaultro> my officemate will be back next week :(
[19:31:40] <defaultro> but boss told me he wants the fix to be in by friday
[19:31:51] <defaultro> did you see the code?
[19:32:00] <defaultro> is there something wrong there?
[19:32:47] <tw2113> ?submit @ tw2113
[19:32:47] <bot-t> tw2113, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[19:33:02] <coldhead> fedya: the author states that he prefers forum.jquery.com for support, and look, here's a recent answered question http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-validator-and-multiple-error-div
[19:33:13] <coldhead> why not hedge your bets and post to forums AND so
[19:33:15] <coldhead> :P
[19:33:34] <hye> <coldhead> hye: #jQuery will probably disagree that the clientside is "more complex" :)
[19:33:35] <hye> lol
[19:33:38] <coldhead> defaultro: there's nothing wrong with this snippet
[19:33:41] <hye> I bet
[19:33:45] <defaultro> k
[19:33:50] <hye> but if I do clientside I would have to do a bunch of  :visible selectors
[19:34:01] <coldhead> if you want to fix it without worrying about outlying code use ?live
[19:34:01] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[19:34:13] <coldhead> so it will work even if the element isnt in the dom yet
[19:34:20] <coldhead> defaultro: ^^
[19:34:45] <defaultro> checking
[19:34:56] <defaultro> .live?
[19:35:09] <coldhead> yes
[19:35:19] <defaultro> ok, I'm trying to understand the syntax :D
[19:35:24] <coldhead> so .click(function becomes .live('click, function
[19:35:25] <defaultro> way to complex for me
[19:35:29] <coldhead> and the rest should be the same
[19:35:35] <coldhead> it's a one line change, babe :)
[19:35:39] <defaultro> oh
[19:35:47] <defaultro> is it the one I showed to you?
[19:35:52] <coldhead> yes
[19:35:56] <defaultro> cool
[19:36:05] <coldhead> you should be able to use what i typed without even reading the docs
[19:36:16] <coldhead> but of course you will also read the docs to know wtf you are doing
[19:37:02] <defaultro> ok
[19:38:45] <xboi209> how would i display the value of an alt attribute?
[19:39:01] <defaultro> does this look good coldhead, http://pastebin.com/iYy7Vidf
[19:39:23] <coldhead> xboi209: var alt = $('.something').attr('alt'); $('.alt_holder').text(alt);
[19:39:32] <xboi209> cool
[19:39:41] <coldhead> looks great, defaultro
[19:39:51] <defaultro> ok, I'm going to try it now
[19:41:19] <coldhead> good luck defaultro!
[19:41:25] <defaultro> :)
[19:41:32] <defaultro> i hope I will see something
[19:41:59] <xboi209> coldhead: is there any alternatives to that?
[19:43:37] <defaultro> coldhead, WOW! The link that wasn't working is working now!
[19:43:40] <defaultro> how come?
[19:44:01] <xboi209> for some reason.....that wow looks fake
[19:44:15] <defaultro> what did .live do? why did it make it work?
[19:44:47] <coldhead> defaultro: .live() lets you bind event handlers to elements that may not be in the page yet
[19:45:00] <coldhead> .click() only works for elements that jQuery can find when you bind it
[19:45:14] <coldhead> read the docs :)
[19:45:15] <xboi209> coldhead: are there any alternatives to the code you posted?
[19:45:18] <defaultro> ok, so it's a workaround? How do i really find the culprit?
[19:45:36] <coldhead> xboi209: sure, it depends what you want to do
[19:45:44] <coldhead> "display" is pretty general
[19:46:01] <coldhead> defaultro: the work around is that your code is probably not wrapped in a .ready()
[19:46:06] <coldhead> so it runs immediately
[19:46:17] <defaultro> got it
[19:46:21] <coldhead> .ready says "wait for the page to load and THEN do this stuff"
[19:46:32] <coldhead> which means the element has time to appear on the page first so jQuery can find it
[19:46:39] <defaultro> ok, so I need to find where that .ready is then
[19:47:41] <coldhead> you don't NEED to, .live() is a reasonable fix until your cow orker returns
[19:47:45] <coldhead> it works, don't it?
[19:48:09] <dorkfromfl> Hi
[19:48:43] <defaultro> you are amazing coldhead!!!!! :D
[19:48:50] <defaultro> i've been working on this for 6 hours, LOL
[19:49:00] <defaultro> but I am so glad I found out what the culprit was
[19:49:03] <coldhead> anytime, defaultro
[19:49:06] <defaultro> :)
[19:49:18] <coldhead> when something works on a reload it's almost always to do with timing and ready()
[19:49:55] <defaultro> gotit
[19:50:13] <Whirl3d> why not handle the eent on the container element?
[19:50:22] <dorkfromfl> anyone using the jquery-ui-map v3 plugin?
[19:50:51] <coldhead> because i don't want to spend all day explaining how to do that, Whirl3d
[19:50:53] <coldhead> please feel free
[19:51:09] <Whirl3d> right on. I figured there was a reasonable reason.
[19:51:16] <imsky> sure there was
[19:51:57] * coldhead np: john coltrane - giant steps
[19:52:13] <Whirl3d> defaultro, if you would like to learn another way to handle the click event for dynamically loaded content, let me know.
[19:53:52] <defaultro> sure Whirl3d
[19:55:47] <Whirl3d> here is the thing about live that you should know...it's a great idea, but it really just a lazy way of applying the .on method to the document body.
[19:56:42] <Whirl3d> so, while I love it, it's been deprecated and people might yell at you....so colhead was a saint for getting the problem solved and that's what's important. You can use .on in a similar fashion to achieve the same results.
[19:57:00] <defaultro> ok
[19:57:14] <Whirl3d> by applying the .on handler to the parent element of the content you will be loading, it ensures that the new content won't overwrite it.
[19:57:20] <defaultro> how is .on use or coded?
[19:57:48] <defaultro> problem too is that I am having a hardtime understanding my ofcmate's code. I'm a jquery newbie
[19:58:09] <Whirl3d> ans since events like click, bubble up through the dom, anytime you click on something...every element above it (think parents(),,,parents() etc)  gets the click event.
[19:58:37] <defaultro> k
[19:58:52] <Whirl3d> So in the parent container (that isn't going to be replaced) say $(container).on("click",".buttonSelector", function (e) {do stuff});
[19:59:15] <defaultro> so rather than .live, I should write .on()?
[19:59:35] <Whirl3d> in plain english, that is:   "attach a handler to the container for the event click when fired by buttonselector"
[19:59:37] <defaultro> what about  ".buttonSelector", what is that value I should use
[19:59:49] <Whirl3d> the class of your button
[19:59:59] <defaultro> if you look here, what should it be, http://pastebin.com/iYy7Vidf
[20:00:01] <Whirl3d> so for you it would be .lnk-partner-site
[20:00:02] <defaultro> it's not a button
[20:00:06] <defaultro> ah
[20:00:31] <defaultro> what about the $(container)?
[20:00:34] <Whirl3d> but it could also be "a" to handle all of the anchor elements
[20:00:39] <Whirl3d> think through that
[20:01:10] <Whirl3d> what is the container that will be there regardless of what new content you load.
[20:01:38] <defaultro> I got lost there :)
[20:02:02] <Whirl3d> when  you are loading this content, presumably you are loading it into a div, right?
[20:02:19] <defaultro> checking the code
[20:02:21] <defaultro> one sec
[20:02:41] <defaultro> no, it loads a new browser
[20:02:46] <defaultro> and puts the link there
[20:02:58] <defaultro> like javascript openwindow
[20:03:06] <defaultro> i don't see div
[20:03:06] <coldhead> Whirl3d: we're using live() because the code isn't in ready(), it's not AJAX loaded
[20:03:15] <coldhead> so there relevant container
[20:03:37] <coldhead> there are NO elements when the code is run
[20:03:42] <Whirl3d> plus you may not be able to use .on if you can't use jquery 1.7
[20:03:51] <xboi209> How would i display the value of a class?
[20:04:01] <Whirl3d> and why not an IEFE
[20:05:17] <Whirl3d> xboi209, the "value of a class"   that's like asking how do you display the value of Orange
[20:05:37] <xboi209> <p class="value"></p>
[20:05:54] <Whirl3d> so you want the text?
[20:05:57] <xboi209> yeah
[20:06:04] <Whirl3d> $(".value").text();
[20:06:09] <defaultro> coldhead, Whirl3d, I want to attend a JQUERY training and I am sure my boss will allow me to attend it. Which would you recommend?
[20:06:12] <coldhead> defaultro: the take home message is a) use a more recent jQuery, b) use .ready() and c) prefer .on() to .live()
[20:06:28] <defaultro> ok
[20:06:36] <coldhead> defaultro: the courses taught by Bocoup are outstanding
[20:06:37] <defaultro> maybe we're using latest jquery too
[20:06:44] <coldhead> check them out
[20:06:47] <defaultro> i will check them out
[20:06:52] <Whirl3d> but if you can't, .live will get your through!
[20:06:58] <defaultro> k
[20:07:10] <defaultro> svn ci the changes now :D
[20:07:23] <defaultro> really thank you folks!!! :D so happy
[20:07:42] <Whirl3d> beaucoup, huh? Do they offer on-line trainging?
[20:07:52] <Whirl3d> bocoup, lol sorry
[20:08:16] <coldhead> no, it's face to face
[20:08:19] <coldhead> but so worth it
[20:08:20] <defaultro> nice
[20:08:36] <coldhead> ben_alman, rmurphey, danheberden, tbranyen et al.
[20:08:40] <Whirl3d> but I'd have to go to New York or Massachussets?
[20:08:46] <coldhead> they can come to you
[20:08:51] <coldhead> or they tour sometimes
[20:09:10] <xboi209> Whirl3d: It doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/3kv4u/
[20:09:28] <Whirl3d> it works fine
[20:09:38] <Whirl3d> There's no text in the value class
[20:10:03] <Whirl3d> try adding some text....<p class='value'>TEST</p>    $(".value").text()=="TEST"
[20:10:30] <Whirl3d> and besides, what you wrote doesn't do anything with the value
[20:10:40] <Whirl3d> it's as though you said,      ORANGE
[20:11:02] <Whirl3d> the interpreter is going to be like, "WTF do you want me to do with this odd value ?"
[20:11:30] <Whirl3d> so try console.log($(".value").text());
[20:12:14] <Whirl3d> which will log the value to your developer's console which you use to debug (Chrome dev Tools, or Firebug for example)
[20:13:18] <xboi209> umm
[20:14:38] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/3kv4u/4/
[20:15:33] <Whirl3d> as you can see, I assign the text in the value paragraph to the "origValue" variable. Then I creat a new variable and convert the origValue to lowercase. Then I tell the result paragraph to make it's text the new value.
[20:16:19] <xboi209> ic
[20:18:12] <Whirl3d> but do yourself a favor. Try to avoid using keywords for variable names...."value" may work, but it might get confusing...try "pval" or "textval" or something more descriptive and less likely to get confused with a function name or something..
[20:18:51] <black_warlock> hey hey
[20:19:06] <black_warlock> guys can you give a little help here
[20:19:08] <Whirl3d> we're the monkeees...
[20:19:12] <Whirl3d> yes
[20:19:18] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Nxjew/
[20:19:23] <black_warlock> have to change a link
[20:19:40] <black_warlock> from # to /rss
[20:20:22] <Whirl3d> $("a[href='#']").attr("href", "/rss");
[20:21:15] <black_warlock> but i must get only the links inside li with class rss
[20:21:32] <Whirl3d> so add that to your selector
[20:21:46] <Whirl3d> $("li.rss a[href="#".......
[20:21:51] <black_warlock> $(".rss a[href='#']").attr("href", "/rss");
[20:21:59] <black_warlock> ah
[20:22:07] <Whirl3d> what you said works too
[20:22:13] <black_warlock> =)
[20:23:03] <Whirl3d> I have this regex program that converts regex to spoken word...it's pretty awesome. I wish we had a bot that would do that same thing in here.
[20:23:40] <Whirl3d> for jquery of course.
[20:27:23] <black_warlock> thank you man
[20:27:30] <black_warlock> gud nite =)
[20:43:34] <ibodi> howto append a tr into a table at the 5th tr
[20:44:00] <defaultro> coldhead, should I attend javasscript training or jquery?
[20:45:12] <hye> ibodi $("table tr:nth-child(4)").append("<tr></tr>");
[20:45:18] <databack> jquery is javascript :)
[20:47:09] <ibodi> hye does not work
[20:47:24] <databack> defaultro, jquery is another layer of abstraction over JavaScript, and hides the language itself. To truly understand jQuery you must understand JavaScript.
[20:47:37] <databack> So the answer is: learn JavaScript.
[20:47:58] <defaultro> ok
[20:48:07] <defaultro> thanks
[20:48:16] <databack> np
[20:49:35] <MadonnaIsMyMommy> So what's stopping Zepto other than IE 8/IE 7/ IE 6?
[20:49:53] <ibodi> hye : "table tr-nth..." works. but this does not: $('#id tr:nth-child(4)')...
[20:51:16] <cohitre> $("table tr:eq(4)").after("<tr></tr>");
[20:52:13] <ibodi> cohitre:  <table id='abc'>... works ?
[20:53:00] <cohitre> i don't know what that means, but you can replace the table in my selector for an id and it should work
[20:53:54] <ibodi> cohitre: as soon as i change to #id it does not work. use generic word "table .." works
[20:54:28] <cohitre> what's the id of your table? are you using the right id in your selector?
[20:54:37] <ibodi> <table id='abc'>...
[20:54:59] <ibodi> $('#abc tr:eq(4)').append(...)
[20:55:22] <cohitre> what does your html look like, can you paste it somewhere?
[20:55:26] <cohitre> ? pastie @ ibodi
[20:55:26] <bot-t> ibodi, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[20:56:03] <ibodi> cohitre: well just a "<table id='abc'><tr>...</tr></table> normal table
[20:56:45] <ibodi> cohitre: when i do this works: $('table tr:eq(4)').append(...)
[20:56:53] <cohitre> then what i said should work. if you want to insert it after a certain row you have to use after, not append
[20:56:56] <cohitre> ? after
[20:56:56] <bot-t> .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[20:58:48] <ibodi> cohitre: ok works now with after() :)
[20:58:50] <ibodi> thanks
[20:59:14] <alicja> Hello everyone, i have a textarea and there is a button called pen, so when you click on it it should display the textare but it wont, I want to create a lightbox basically but when i use opacity it seems like its not working, this is my http://jsfiddle.net/VRU4f/6/ any help would be grat :)
[20:59:18] <alicja> great *
[20:59:19] <MadonnaIsMyMommy> I want to build a jquery killer.
[21:00:50] <cohitre> alicja: do you know how to use your browser development tools?
[21:01:07] <cohitre> because you have a typo that the dev tools would've told you about.
[21:01:31] <alicja> cohitre, umm a little bit, let me check
[21:07:11] <alicja> cohitre i fixed it http://jsfiddle.net/VRU4f/7/ but still not working :/
[21:10:05] <cohitre> alicja: http://jsfiddle.net/VRU4f/8/
[21:10:18] <defaultro> hey folks, what tool do you use to deploy code during production release?
[21:13:13] <MadonnaIsMyMommy> :-)
[21:19:12] <alicja> cohitre thank you, i will check how it works on the site
[21:22:06] <optraz> lol what a nickname... MadonnaIsMyMommy
[21:22:27] <MadonnaIsMyMommy> optraz: I really believe that Madonna is my mommy.
[21:23:08] <optraz> believe? you must be dreaming
[21:23:17] * MadonnaIsMyMommy has believed it since he was a child and foster parents couldn't do anything to stop it.
[21:23:45] <optraz> lol
[21:23:46] <optraz> ack
[21:23:58] <MadonnaIsMyMommy> They're just going to ship me off to another home, so they certainly aren't my mommy.
[21:24:09] <optraz> lol
[21:24:18] <MadonnaIsMyMommy> But Madonna is a lot of people's mommy now. ;-)
[21:25:02] <tw2113> it's Angelina Jolie that wants to adopt everyone
[21:25:12] <optraz> lol
[21:25:21] <MadonnaIsMyMommy> It's the best thing one can do with such limited time we have on earth and such intangible meaning -- Make other people happy while they are here.
[21:25:35] <ruby_on_tails> hello
[21:25:50] <ruby_on_tails> can someone suggest me a name for this http://jsfiddle.net/uE9NF/1/ ?
[21:26:00] <MadonnaIsMyMommy> tw2113: Sounds like a beautiful thing.
[21:26:25] <tw2113> ruby_on_tails reminds me of that old windows screensaver
[21:26:49] <ruby_on_tails> tw2113: yea, but i cant name it that
[21:27:01] <tw2113> but you can take inspiration
[21:27:02] <databack> lol, that's crazy something like that is created with a few lines of javascript and html5
[21:27:29] <cohitre> "mistify your mind" screensaver http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-howMhFecQ
[21:27:37] <MadonnaIsMyMommy> ruby_on_tails: WHAT. THE. FUCK. HAVE. YOU DONE. BOY.
[21:28:01] <coldhead> its also called "ribbons"
[21:28:04] <MadonnaIsMyMommy> Thi sis awesome.
[21:28:11] <coldhead> did you do this, ruby_on_tails ?
[21:28:15] <tw2113> muskify your canvas
[21:28:17] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: yes
[21:28:25] <ruby_on_tails> MadonnaIsMyMommy: thats going as a tutorial on my site
[21:28:26] <alicja> cohitre, if i want to make the textarea appear as the highest z-index and pushed the whole background to the back it wont work, i tried to use instead of  $('#textarea').css('opacity', 0.3); use  $('#content').css('opacity', 0.3); but unforutnatley it wont do anything, basically i want to appear the textarea all in the attention, but appear the backgorund kinda darker
[21:28:30] <MadonnaIsMyMommy> ruby_on_tails: I want a Madonna photo as a background.
[21:28:41] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: it was an accident, i was trying to build a flocking behaviour
[21:28:45] <MadonnaIsMyMommy> ruby_on_tails: Cool. Sounds like it will be a great tutorial.
[21:29:22] <coldhead> nice work ruby_on_tails
[21:29:27] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: thanks
[21:29:33] <coldhead> hope you get the flocking thing working too
[21:29:39] <coldhead> flocking is awesome/creepy
[21:31:02] <optraz> ruby_on_tails: why you do that for?
[21:31:04] <databack> looking at ruby's code, I wonder WTF people will need Flash for
[21:31:09] <Whirl3d> flocking? as in the fuzzy wallpaper? or as in the best social-platform integrated browser that had to go belly up because Zynga stole all their developers one day?
[21:31:16] <ruby_on_tails> coldhead: the flocking has some bugs, i need to spend more time on it to get it work, i guess i should be able to get that done
[21:31:20] <coldhead> lol Whirl3d
[21:31:32] <ruby_on_tails> optraz: i post them on my site http://thecodeplayer.com people can learn stuff in a cool way
[21:31:48] <ruby_on_tails> Whirl3d: i was working on the wallpaper thing
[21:32:10] <Whirl3d> ruby_on_tails, thecodeplayer.com is your creation?
[21:32:21] <ruby_on_tails> Whirl3d: yes
[21:32:30] <ruby_on_tails> tw2113: what does muskify mean ?
[21:32:30] <Whirl3d> absolutely brilliant.
[21:32:34] <ruby_on_tails> thanks
[21:32:38] <optraz> ruby_on_tails: that's cool
[21:33:09] <tw2113> i dunno
[21:33:14] <ruby_on_tails> hah
[21:33:21] <tw2113> i thought of the word "mistify" and "musk"
[21:33:27] <tw2113> and mashed them together
[21:33:34] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[21:34:57] <databack> ruby, this site is way cool my man. props
[21:35:28] <ruby_on_tails> thanks databack
[21:37:55] <Es0teric> ruby_on_tails your site looks like... pintrest
[21:38:15] <ruby_on_tails> Es0teric: yes, i will be working on the design to make it non pinteresty
[21:38:29] <ruby_on_tails> the design was rushed, was working on the player thing
[21:38:30] <Es0teric> i do like that css3 cloud though
[21:38:33] <Es0teric> thats pretty cool
[21:39:14] <ruby_on_tails> that one is actually not mine, i copied it from somewhere to test the player in the initial stages
[21:39:33] <Es0teric> i see
[21:39:44] <ruby_on_tails> but i guess i gave credits to the author
[21:40:37] <Es0teric> this is
[21:40:40] <Es0teric> cool though...
[21:40:42] <Es0teric> really cool
[21:44:19] <coldhead> well, i appear to be the only dissenter but i think your site is terrible, ruby_on_tails
[21:44:27] <coldhead> JUST KIDDING :D
[21:45:11] <Es0teric> lol coldhead
[21:46:14] <ruby_on_tails> http://jsfiddle.net/uE9NF/9/  this is the flocking code, i guess something is wrong with some parameters, doesnt work like i expected
[21:47:51] <coldhead> that's closer to flocking than i've ever managed
[21:47:56] <coldhead> it looks pretty close
[21:48:12] <coldhead> i guess the cohesion/separation code needs tweaking
[21:48:24] <ruby_on_tails> yea
[21:49:31] <ruby_on_tails> so because it wasnt working, i drew colored lines connecting particles in 100px range to get that ribbon :))=))
[21:51:10] <Whirl3d> it says in the comments that the flocking radius is 20px, but the formula indicates 2...
[21:51:13] <Es0teric> whats flocking?
[21:51:15] <Es0teric> o.O
[21:51:36] <Whirl3d> and the thing is that they flock, but they don't stay that way.
[21:51:59] <coldhead> Es0teric: it emulates the way birds fly together in groups
[21:52:00] <Whirl3d> are they running at different speeds?
[21:52:15] <Es0teric> ohhh, ok coldhead
[21:52:17] <coldhead> their flight paths are influenced by the proximity of other birds nearby
[21:52:35] <gnarf> like birds of a feather?
[21:54:19] <coldhead> or a swarm of killer bees
[21:54:23] <coldhead> probably
[21:54:33] <Es0teric> man... i started getting lost at the 27th line of code on the js of that flocking demo
[21:54:58] <Es0teric> wayyyy too much math
[21:55:03] <ruby_on_tails> Es0teric: follow me on twitter, and when i post the walkthrough it will be easier to follow
[21:55:11] <ruby_on_tails> Es0teric: http://harry.me/2011/02/17/neat-algorithms---flocking
[21:55:15] <abjorn> coldhead!
[21:55:28] <sente> ruby_on_tails: very nice stuff
[21:55:50] <ruby_on_tails> Whirl3d: yes, i had started with 20, but then i was changing things and left it like that without modifying the comments
[21:55:50] <coldhead> abjsy
[21:56:00] <gnarf> ruby_on_tails: I feel like you could make all that logic a lot simpler by making some more named functions
[21:56:16] <gnarf> ruby_on_tails: i find it kinda hard to follow, and I get math & animation code usually ;)
[21:56:19] <ruby_on_tails> gnarf: my functions are named ?
[21:56:21] <abjorn> sup coldhead
[21:56:29] <sente> ruby_on_tails++
[21:56:33] <sente> awesome stuff
[21:56:42] <ruby_on_tails> sente: thanks
[21:56:55] <Es0teric> ruby_on_tails you work for shopify?
[21:56:57] <Es0teric> thats pretty cool
[21:56:59] <Es0teric> and u have an audi?
[21:57:04] <ruby_on_tails> function calculate_cohesion, function calculate_separation, etc
[21:57:20] <ruby_on_tails> Es0teric: no, why do you think so ? i don't work for shopify
[21:57:27] <ruby_on_tails> and i don't have an audi
[21:57:28] <ruby_on_tails> :(
[21:57:30] <Es0teric> well i saw
[21:57:33] <gnarf> ruby_on_tails: yeah
[21:57:38] <Es0teric> the thing...
[21:57:38] <ruby_on_tails> saw what ?
[21:57:40] <Es0teric> the link you gave
[21:57:46] <Es0teric> i thought that was u
[21:57:47] <Es0teric> -_-
[21:57:55] <Es0teric> you said "follow me on twitter"
[21:57:56] <ruby_on_tails> that link isnt mine, i just got it from google
[21:58:00] <Es0teric> then...
[21:58:02] <Es0teric> nvm
[21:58:06] <ruby_on_tails> Es0teric: @thecodeplayer on twitter
[21:58:17] <Es0teric> you should have led with that
[21:58:28] <ruby_on_tails> sorry, i thought i would be considered spamming
[21:58:49] <coldhead> abjorn: pinteresting skinning all the things, sup with you
[21:59:09] <abjorn> that sounds super lame
[21:59:11] <abjorn> im playing pokemon
[21:59:22] <Es0teric> i WAS playing pokemon a couple of hours ago
[21:59:31] <Es0teric> shit i still cant beat pokemon black
[21:59:37] <abjorn> great minds thing alike
[21:59:42] <abjorn> except I'm playing Sapphire
[21:59:54] <Es0teric> and that shit sucks... because pokemon heart gold doesnt work on my DS
[22:01:32] <Es0teric> they should be focusing on remakes for s/r/e, abjorn instead of b2/w2.. shits a disgrace
[22:02:01] <Es0teric> but anyways
[22:03:46] <abjorn> lol
[22:04:43] <coldhead> Committed revision 165900.
[22:11:27] <coldhead> sweet as
[22:17:28] <hariom> I am using jquery 1.7.2 as .live() has gone deprecated but I find .on() not working when used in html page (in place of earlier .live() )   but the same code works in firebug.    $('a.link_exclude').on({click: function(e) { console.log('clicked');}});
[22:17:51] <coldhead> on() has a different syntax
[22:18:06] <coldhead> ?on
[22:18:07] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:18:46] <coldhead> thanks for the syntax summary, bot-t >: |
[22:18:53] <coldhead> bot-t: i love you
[22:18:53] <bot-t> no you don't
[22:18:58] <coldhead> lets never fight again
[22:19:01] <coldhead> ?fweep
[22:19:01] <bot-t> coldhead, ZZZZ ZZZZ ZZZZ
[22:21:47] <hobs> lets never fight before
[22:21:59] <hariom> coldhead: I tried different syntax and the one I sent also works in firebug. My problem is why this doesn't work on the page?
[22:23:18] <tw2113> bah *struggles to get a local json file to load and be console logged*
[22:24:33] <coldhead> hariom: in firebug, the elements are already in the page
[22:24:35] <coldhead> so it works
[22:24:57] <coldhead> if you're binding to elements that aren't there yet it doesn't work
[22:25:38] <hariom> coldhead: correct, and I used live when the elements were added dynamically. When .live() works why doesn't .on() ?
[22:26:05] <hariom> coldhead: Elements exists before I call for 'click' event
[22:26:45] <hariom> coldhead: it is after document load when html is loaded
[22:27:32] <Cork> hariom: on doesn't work the same way as live does
[22:27:49] <Cork> marienz: the $() selector should point to a persistent parent, NOT the element your after
[22:27:54] <coldhead> oh thank god, Cork can run you through it hariom
[22:27:57] <coldhead> he's a saint
[22:28:03] <Cork> <_<'
[22:28:03] <hariom> Cork: What is the replacement for .live() ?
[22:28:19] <hobs> coldhead: does that mean I get to martyr him
[22:28:39] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'selector', function() {}) === $(selector).live('click', function() {});
[22:28:46] <Cork> opps
[22:28:49] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'selector', function() {}) === $('selector').live('click', function() {});
[22:29:11] <coldhead> in time, hobs, in time
[22:29:44] <Cork> hariom: though you should try to find a closer parent then document
[22:30:32] <gnarf> Cork++
[22:31:20] <coldhead> we should stop recommending closer parents, it's an antipattern
[22:31:35] <coldhead> its a performance enhancement that people can get around to later
[22:31:43] <coldhead> if anyone ever visits their stupid site
[22:31:54] <Cork> coldhead: its not that much a performance enhancement
[22:32:05] <coldhead> then what's the advantage?
[22:32:09] <gnarf> but logically, it makes sense to bind the event on the closest parent anyway...
[22:32:16] <Cork> but if you bind it to a parent that is somewhat related to the section
[22:32:16] <tw2113> i supposed valid json would have helped
[22:32:30] <Cork> when you remove the section you lose the listners too
[22:32:30] <coldhead> most people here just want a drop-in replacement for live()
[22:33:09] <Cork> while if you bind it to document, its never removed
[22:33:23] <coldhead> which... only affects people with OCD, in practice
[22:33:25] <coldhead> :P
[22:33:34] <Cork> OCD?
[22:33:41] <coldhead> ?w ocd
[22:33:42] <bot-t> coldhead, Obsessive–compulsive disorder - Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts that produce uneasiness, apprehension, fear, or worry, by repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing the associated anxiety, or by a combination of such obsessions and compulsions. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive–compulsive_disorder
[22:33:47] <Cork> -_-'
[22:33:53] <coldhead> :D
[22:34:12] <tw2113> with json, must each key be unique within the array it's in?
[22:34:12] <coldhead> i'm just going to keep recommending .live()
[22:34:19] <Cork> lol
[22:34:38] <Cork> tw2113: arrays doesn't have keys
[22:34:39] <coldhead> BinaryKitten will hurt me for it but i kind of like that
[22:34:54] <Cork> tw2113:  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] <-- array
[22:35:34] <Cork> tw2113: { "some":1, "values":2, "dup":3, "dup":4 } <-- object
[22:35:50] <hariom> Cork: I used it with $(document) and also with the closed dom element that is persistence. But I see that it doesn't seem to work. But same thing works in firebug
[22:35:58] <tw2113> ok do objects need unique keys?
[22:36:06] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: do you need the quotes there ?
[22:36:17] <ruby_on_tails> i never used quotes while creating an object like that
[22:36:24] <tw2113> i'm trying to work with http://michaelbox.net/nonwordpress/achoo.txt but keep getting http://michaelbox.net/nonwordpress/achoo.json
[22:36:25] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: yes, json demands string keys
[22:36:35] <ruby_on_tails> Cork: hmm ok
[22:36:49] <Cork> and it has to be "", '' isn't allowed
[22:37:14] <tw2113> bah, chrome even strips out the extras despite the .txt
[22:37:58] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[22:38:10] <Cork> tw2113: remember that track will overwrite each other though
[22:38:24] <gnarf> ruby_on_tails: JSON requires it, but JS doesn't
[22:38:35] <Cork> tw2113:  you'll only get one track
[22:38:45] <tw2113> yeah, noticing that
[22:38:47] <blendedbychris> how can i toggle the width of an item from 48px to "auto"
[22:38:54] <blendedbychris> with animate()
[22:39:13] <tw2113> am i going to need to number them somehow?
[22:39:14] <gnarf> blendedbychris: its actually quite a pain in the ass...  animating to "auto" is pretty much impossible
[22:39:30] <ruby_on_tails> gnarf: got it
[22:39:42] <blendedbychris> gnarf i was thinking storing the original width in data maybe
[22:39:44] <Cork> tw2113: you want "tracks":["", "", "", "", ""] or "tracks":[{"track":""}, {"track":""}, {"track":""}, {"track":""}, {"track":""}]
[22:39:51] <blendedbychris> gnarf any other thoughts?
[22:39:51] <gnarf> blendedbychris: you have to set css to auto, read the end point, set css back to original, hope this doesn't cause a flash, then animate to it, and have a callback that sets it back to auto
[22:40:26] <gnarf> blendedbychris: ^^^ thats how you do it
[22:40:34] <tw2113> I could probably handle losing the "track" part
[22:41:13] <Cork> that would be tracks[0] for the first one and tracks[0].track for the second
[22:41:59] <Cork> hariom: you have a link or fiddle?
[22:44:20] <blendedbychris> gnarf: :(
[22:44:23] <blendedbychris> that sounds shitty
[22:44:52] <coldhead> its simpler to redo your CSS and not use 'auto' :/
[22:45:09] <blendedbychris> coldhead: that's a stupid constraint
[22:45:21] <coldhead> UR A STUPID CONSTRAINT
[22:45:26] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[22:45:41] <coldhead> anyway gnarf's thing WORKS
[22:45:50] <coldhead> its what jQuery would have to do internally
[22:46:06] <tw2113> perfect, thanks cork
[22:46:15] <coldhead> the auto width is unknown without actually setting width: auto
[22:46:51] <hariom> Cork: it works now with $(document) and other closer dom elements. I see an issue here though. When I click on the mentioned element, it doesn't work for first three clicks and after that I see the debug (console) msg appearing
[22:47:31] <blendedbychris> I like the love this issue has gottten too http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7641
[22:47:33] <Cork> hariom: sounds like your not binding the event before that
[22:47:33] <hariom> Cork: This is how I am using:       $("div#main").on("click", "a.link_exclude", function(e) {console.log('clicked'); });
[22:47:49] <Cork> hariom: or you have another event listner that uses return false;
[22:47:58] <Cork> (never use return false;)
[22:48:01] <hariom> Cork: I am binding the event in the document ready
[22:48:35] <Cork> hariom: and the class is there from the server generated html?
[22:48:41] <coldhead> blendedbychris: gnarf is a core contributor to jquery -- you're getting the best of support
[22:48:42] <Cork> (.link_exclude)
[22:49:03] <blendedbychris> coldhead: i'm just pissed i can't just do it heh
[22:49:12] <blendedbychris> or rather irritated… not pissed
[22:49:14] <coldhead> you CAN, it's just awkward
[22:49:24] <coldhead> but its the nature of 'auto', it's made of magic
[22:51:01] <hariom> Cork: strange it works now with single click.
[22:51:37] <hariom> Cork: I didn't modify anything. Just removed few blank lines to align the code
[22:56:35] <blendedbychris> can i not do something lie $('#navigation-social-navigation li a.link-youtube').clone().appendTo($(this).parent()) <<
[22:57:02] <blendedbychris> ah hrm chaining has me beat
[22:58:13] <coldhead> chainaing vs readability: the eternal struggle
[22:58:48] <gnarf> blendedbychris: I might be able to wrap it up into a plugin for 1.8
[22:58:50] <gnarf> but like
[22:58:53] <coldhead> spelink: the eternal struggle
[22:59:12] <gnarf> I don't think that core should be responsible for doing that as it's basically a "hack" anyway
[22:59:49] <coldhead> and there are no hacks in core
[22:59:52] <coldhead> >_>
[23:02:13] <xboi209> srry to bother you guys but can anyone explain .data() to me? I don't really understand it
[23:02:28] <Cork> xboi209: what about it?
[23:02:42] <xboi209> like ummm
[23:02:47] <blendedbychris> gnarf: any idea why this isn'y logging anything… http://pastie.textmate.org/private/bg3d5om9jjeri4pxhm3qma
[23:02:58] <coldhead> xboi209: read this: http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[23:03:08] <coldhead> you will understand EVERYTHING
[23:03:33] <blendedbychris> oh poo "remove()"
[23:03:54] <blendedbychris> still no idea why it isn't running that funciton at all
[23:04:33] <tw2113> Cork the result: http://trexthepirate.com/achoomix/
[23:06:51] <gnarf> blendedbychris: http://jsfiddle.net/sjssA/
[23:06:58] <gnarf> blendedbychris: insane, but it works :)
[23:07:31] <gnarf> blendedbychris: thats using the 1.8 api shit tho
[23:09:43] <Deele> hey
[23:09:50] <blendedbychris> not to be a pain in the butt but … what's it look like for 1.7?
[23:10:16] <Deele> which jquery ui element is useful for integer number field with those increment/decrement arrows in right side?
[23:11:47] <xboi209> so .hasdata() can only return true or false answers?
[23:12:20] <Cork> xboi209: yes
[23:12:27] <xboi209> k
[23:13:06] <blendedbychris> gnarf: actually nm i got it my own way :) thanks for your idea though :)
[23:14:44] <gnarf> blendedbychris: no prob, the approach works, its just like - annoying, and prone to bugs/edge cases which is why i never solved it in the 1.8 effects rewrite
[23:20:14] <guy> I've asked this once and forgot.
[23:20:19] <guy> https://gist.github.com/e069fd6a098a76d31f23
[23:20:27] <guy> what's the proper way to create container?
[23:20:31] <Deele> could anyone suggest, which jquery ui element is useful for integer number field with those increment/decrement arrows in right side?
[23:21:08] <Cork> guy: var wrapper = $();
[23:21:32] <guy> well, that didn't work.
[23:21:49] <guy> console log returns []
[23:21:49] <Cork> guy: ah, way you append to it
[23:21:59] <Cork> so what element do you want as a parent?
[23:22:05] <guy> no element.
[23:22:16] <Cork> or do you just want to add the new div to an empty jquery selector?
[23:22:30] <guy> Correct.
[23:22:54] <Cork> var obj =  $(); obj = obj.add($('<div/>'));
[23:23:10] <Cork> appendTo/append and the like appends to a dom element
[23:24:06] <guy> https://gist.github.com/1e7cface7ed009ebb512
[23:24:16] <guy> shouldn't this theoretically work too?
[23:24:34] <Cork> no
[23:24:42] <Cork> youll add an array of jquery objects
[23:24:57] <guy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/747178/how-to-create-multiple-html-elements-with-jquery
[23:24:58] <Cork> [[],[],[],[]] instead of [,,,,,]
[23:25:07] <guy> uh.
[23:25:32] <xboi209> if i had $('#test').data("test");    would this work? if ($.hasData(#test)=="true")
[23:26:52] <Cork> xboi209: no, if($.hasData('#test')) {}
[23:26:57] <jarco> I am changing the width of an li on hover. Other li's are floated next to it. How can I make it that instead of pushing them away the expanding li will flow OVER the li next to it?
[23:27:06] <Cork> xboi209: it doens't return a string
[23:27:23] <xboi209> :/
[23:27:26] <mindis|wurk> salutations. i seem to have a problem with draggable. namely that when i call .draggable('disable') or .draggable('destroy') nothing happens, the element still remains draggable
[23:30:00] <mindis|wurk> hmm, now it works. weird
[23:30:15] <thomedy> alright it has been a bit but im back
[23:33:16] <shinysky> jarco: can you set negative left margin on the next li?
[23:35:04] <coldhead> wb thomedy
[23:38:08] <jarco> shinysky: awesome idea
[23:38:21] <raj> is it slow to select an element using the value of its .data('num')?
[23:39:11] <raj> $('.lines :data[num=x])
[23:39:14] <raj> $('.lines :data[num=x]')
[23:39:32] <raj> oh, can't be a variable
[23:39:32] <raj> hmm
[23:40:07] <raj> oh, yes it can, just break the quotes
[23:40:08] <guy> use callback instead. $('.lines').filter(function(){ return $(this).data('num') == 2; });
[23:40:27] <raj> guy, is it slow to do this?
[23:40:33] <raj> say, compared to selecting by class
[23:40:54] <guy> If you 2000+ entries, it might take a second.
[23:41:19] <raj> k
[23:41:36] <raj> guess I have no choice anyhow
[23:41:45] <raj> thanks for the 411
[23:42:18] <Cork> raj: its slow to select on attributes
[23:42:31] <raj> guy, btw, any difference in speed btwn your filter function and my :data[num=" + x + "] ?
[23:42:34] <Cork> no matter from where your doing it
[23:42:51] <raj> Cork, except for id?
[23:43:04] <Cork> your not selecting on attributes when your using id's or classes
[23:43:14] <guy> raj: ID is no way faster than selecting by class.
[23:43:17] <guy> Cork: please, define "slow"
[23:43:17] <Cork> id's is a separat hash in the browser
[23:43:32] <raj> ok, this is the jquery .data() "attribute" anyway, not the real data-something-whatever attribute
[23:44:10] <guy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1230636/css-optimization-element-id-vs-class
[23:44:13] <Cork> guy: if your running over a big range or elements and doing it a lot of times selecting on attributes can be a performance killer -- slow
[23:44:16] <guy> raj: Note the comments.
[23:45:33] <guy> https://dev.anuary.com/221e8407-0cd7-5796-bc9a-decfd9ede0e8/public/css/frontend.css
[23:45:42] <guy> using selectors the right way. `body > .template.home > .overlay > .container.ready > .column.prize > .picture`
[23:45:46] <guy> heh
[23:46:54] <Whirl3d> $.data() gives you access to the  jquery object, which may or may not be present in the element's data-property attribute. that is to say that $("<div class='elem'/>").appendTo(body);$(".elem").data("test","some Value"); console.log($(".elem").attr("data-test")); will be undefined.
[23:46:58] <blendedbychris> gnarf: one last thing before you head out… any idea how to make these animations a bit less "spazy" if more than one is occuring at one time? http://ccfitness.org/ccause
[23:47:23] <gnarf> blendedbychris: it claims its offline
[23:47:25] <raj> k cool, thank you guys
[23:47:26] <gnarf> ?demo
[23:47:27] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[23:47:29] <blendedbychris> gnarf: beet me t oit
[23:47:33] <blendedbychris> beat me to it *
[23:47:51] <gnarf> instructions? :)
[23:47:59] <blendedbychris> gnarf: bottom twitter thingies
[23:48:17] <blendedbychris> hover over them :)
[23:48:17] <Whirl3d> but $("<div class='elem' data-test='someValue'/>).apendTo("body"); console.log($(".elem").data("test"))   will give you 'someValue'
[23:48:32] <blendedbychris> gnarf: not sure if theres a way to improve that.
[23:48:47] <gnarf> blendedbychris: um - lots of math
[23:49:08] <blendedbychris> heh… i was thinking lots of logic
[23:49:20] <gnarf> blendedbychris: so like you want to make sure that the time it takes to animate the width corresponds with the amount of distance it needs to animate
[23:49:21] <coldhead> IT'S THE SAME THING
[23:49:24] <gnarf> also, liner easing helps
[23:49:30] <blendedbychris> coldhead: wrong window again?
[23:49:44] <coldhead> no, math and logic are the same, i feel it deeply
[23:50:20] <gnarf> blendedbychris: just tweak with values, and try to describe why it feels "spazy" a little better
[23:50:29] <gnarf> like i think that means that the overall width is moving too much
[23:50:42] <Whirl3d> queue:false
[23:50:56] <gnarf> like if you move "slow" it feels better
[23:51:09] <gnarf> why?
[23:51:26] <blendedbychris> gnarf: well i think what annoys me is that it "queues" the hover actions.
[23:51:28] <Whirl3d> Because, string throught them 5 times and it's a wreck
[23:51:36] <gnarf> blendedbychris: .stop()
[23:51:44] <Whirl3d> pass queue:false and it's better
[23:52:06] <gnarf> ?stop @blendedbychris
[23:52:06] <bot-t> blendedbychris, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[23:52:15] <gnarf> you don't want jump to end
[23:52:28] <Whirl3d> $("elem").animate({width:300},{duration:400, queue:false});
[23:52:33] <blendedbychris> Whirl3d: thanks
[23:52:49] <coldhead> great work everyone, take 5
[23:52:50] <gnarf> Whirl3d: the old animation will still be running in the background, which will cause issues
[23:52:53] <Whirl3d> then no matter where in the animation sequence it is, it will start from there and animate to the end
[23:52:55] <gnarf> easier to .stop().animate()
[23:53:34] <Whirl3d> Personally, I always stop(true, false).animate(propsobj, actionsobj)    with queue:false in the actions obj
[23:53:42] <xboi209> how would i get this to work? http://jsfiddle.net/M2W7h/
[23:54:50] <Whirl3d> xboi209, ehsy is $(Test)?
[23:55:04] <Whirl3d> sory
[23:55:09] <Whirl3d> what is $(test)?
[23:55:14] <Whirl3d> what does that mean to you?
[23:55:26] <xboi209> umm
[23:55:57] <xboi209> maybe i did that wrong
[23:56:02] <Whirl3d> rather than just try random shit, think it out and justify what you are doing. $(test) doesn't make any sense in this context
[23:56:15] <xboi209> srry
[23:56:19] <xboi209> i have a headache atm
[23:56:22] <Whirl3d> don't be sorry
[23:56:32] <Whirl3d> I was just suggesting that it should read like a story
[23:56:33] <blendedbychris> gnarf: not entirely sure what issue you are referring to… queue seems to fix it
[23:56:49] <xboi209> oh wait
[23:56:50] <xboi209> i got it
[23:56:55] <xboi209> i know why i wrote dat
[23:56:59] <Whirl3d> and usually when you see $(something)   you want the sentence to start with "Select something"
[23:57:15] <blendedbychris> Whirl3d: thanks for that, works brilliant.
[23:57:16] <Whirl3d> cool, why?
[23:57:27] <xboi209> k so there's a var called test that's suppose to get the id
[23:57:38] <Whirl3d> blendedbychris, but try the stop(true, false) before animate
[23:57:46] <xboi209> the (test) was there to call that variable
[23:57:51] <Whirl3d> gnarf has a great point about wasted cycles happening int he background
[23:58:04] <xboi209> g2g
[23:58:18] <Whirl3d> gnite
[23:59:04] <Whirl3d> I setup my own animate method   altAnimate which stops the previous animation, calls the animate method and returns a promise
[23:59:17] <blendedbychris> ah
[23:59:26] <blendedbychris> well thanks for all the help folks
[23:59:28] <raj> follow up question Cork: is $('.container').find('.someclass') any faster/slower than $('.container .someclass')?
