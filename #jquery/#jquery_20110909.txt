[00:00:12] <jrockjiggz> jquery ui has a tooltip?
[00:01:25] <thapelo> I have upgraded from jquery 1.2.5 to 1.6.3 and my overlay() function does not work. Does anyone know what could be the problem?
[00:01:27] <bananasontoast> Not yet, but in the Github account there is one
[00:01:27] <bananasontoast> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138112/Tooltip
[00:01:47] <bananasontoast> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.tooltip.js
[00:01:49] <misterm> bananasontoast: have you checked if it has something like a .show() method?
[00:02:47] <bananasontoast> It has an open method, but I am not quite sure how I load that on the page load
[00:02:53] <misterm> or maybe open/close
[00:02:59] <brianpWins> using jquerymobile I need to tell if checkboxes are checked or not but is(':checked') returns the incorrect value oddly enough $(':checked') will return the field if it is checked but then using is(':checked') on it returns false
[00:03:06] <misterm> bananasontoast: what do you mean
[00:04:08] <bananasontoast> Wellâ€¦ I can attach it like thisâ€¦ $("
[00:04:08] <bananasontoast> DERP, whoops
[00:04:08] <bananasontoast> Wellâ€¦ I can attach it like thisâ€¦ $(".makeToolTip").tooltip();
[00:04:28] <bananasontoast> But I dunno how to make it show on load
[00:04:40] <misterm> bananasontoast: you can call open after you create the tooltip
[00:04:49] <misterm> bananasontoast: presumably you're doing that on page load
[00:04:59] <misterm> bananasontoast: I'd also check if it has a property you can set to default it to open
[00:05:01] <jrockjiggz> .tooltip("open") ?
[00:06:18] <misterm> bananasontoast: maybe .tooltip({hide: false} or {show: true}, something like that
[00:06:21] <jrockjiggz> .tooltip({open: true}) ?
[00:06:39] <bananasontoast> LEGEND
[00:06:42] <bananasontoast> DARY
[00:06:48] <misterm> I'm not familiar with the new tooltip widget so I wouldn't know offhand exactly the option, but yea
[00:07:14] <jrockjiggz> or .tooltip({options: {open: true}}) ?
[00:07:55] <jrockjiggz> anyone have a copy of Windows XP Tablet Edition?
[00:08:20] <misterm> jrockjiggz: that doesn't sound like a #jquery question
[00:08:38] <jrockjiggz> yeaa... worth a shot
[00:09:02] <Trisox> windows xp does that have a tablet edition?
[00:09:16] <misterm> à² _à² 
[00:09:52] <Trisox> ( .  )_(  . )
[00:11:09] <jrockjiggz> yea i have an old laptop that uses a stylus
[00:11:44] <jrockjiggz> its kind of cool, it's an HP, the screen can rotate 180 and lay flat reverse against the keyboard..
[00:12:23] <Nicolas_Leonida2> hi
[00:12:28] <Nicolas_Leonida2>    $(".locationForm > input[type=checkbox]").wrap('<div class="ui-state-default ui-corner-all ui-helper-clearfix formCheckBoxDiv" />');
[00:12:44] <Nicolas_Leonida2> I have a form with class = localForm, I wanna wrap all the textboxes within that form with this
[00:12:50] <aavikkojootti> read the topic before asking
[00:12:54] <Nicolas_Leonida2> what is wrong with my selector?
[00:13:17] <coldhead> the topic is boring :(
[00:13:35] <Nicolas_Leonida2> by textbox I meant checkbox of course
[00:13:47] <aavikkojootti> well yeah, but the jzfiddle is cool
[00:13:48] <jrockjiggz> Nicolas_Leonida2: your selector is .locationForm  not .localForm
[00:14:11] <Nicolas_Leonida2> jrockjiggz: that was a typo, the class is locationForm
[00:14:15] <kevin_xiao> hey guys, I have a problem when using jquery.draggable.  I set position of body to relative, and create draggable with option 'helper: clone'. This is a online demo: http://jsfiddle.net/6gg3q/8/show/
[00:15:02] <Nicolas_Leonida2> I also tried   $("form[class=locationForm] > input[type=checkbox]")
[00:15:03] <Nicolas_Leonida2> didn't work
[00:15:56] <Nicolas_Leonida2> when I remove the   form[class=locationForm]  part it works on all checkboxes so I know it's a selector issue
[00:16:16] <kevin_xiao> @Nicolas, try form.locationForm > input[type=checkbox]
[00:16:52] <nail_> Nicolas_Leonida2: that will only work if the inputs are direct childs of the form
[00:17:47] <Nicolas_Leonida2> nail_: direct child? they are within <dd> tags
[00:18:01] <nail_> to remove the '>'
[00:18:05] <nail_> so remove the '>'
[00:18:32] <Nicolas_Leonida2> this doesn't work form.locationForm input[type=checkbox]
[00:19:10] <kevin_xiao> can you make a sample demo to show your problem? try jsfiddle.net :)
[00:19:36] <Nicolas_Leonida2> kevin_xiao: hard to do, but will try
[00:21:11] <Nicolas_Leonida2> http://jsfiddle.net/MYdWe/
[00:21:14] <Nicolas_Leonida2> there you go
[00:21:35] <Nicolas_Leonida2> that Active checkbox needs to be wrapped
[00:22:14] <kevin_xiao> <formÂ id="locationForm">
[00:22:25] <Nicolas_Leonida2> damn!
[00:23:01] <Nicolas_Leonida2> thanks kevin that was it!
[00:23:51] <kevin_xiao> better to see the code, so jsfiddle rocks:)
[00:24:34] <Robbster> I've got a ul with li's that have a 'click' event bound to them. What is the best-practive for attaching the binding if I add another li?
[00:24:57] <kevin_xiao> @Robbster, try $.delegate or $.live
[00:25:22] <cattlefraud> does scriptaculous have something similar to text() ? (I already asked there, nobody would answer :(   )
[00:26:07] <Robbster> kevin_xiao: humm, never seen those - will check out the docs - thx
[00:26:32] <Nicolas_Leonida2> kevin_xiao: very true
[00:26:43] <Robbster> delegate's description seems like EXACTLY what I'm looking for :)
[00:26:51] <Nicolas_Leonida2> whoever wrote jsfiddle was smarter than I currently am
[00:27:43] <kevin_xiao> glad to help
[00:30:09] <twoface> Hi. I have a <select> box in a absolutely positioned div. In chrome (12 and 13 at least), i can't open the dropdown. Chrome animates the click on the arrow, but it doesn't open. No events is attached to it, but could it be due to some other jquery stuff?
[00:31:08] <Ankabout> can anyone help me on the way to changing this function a bit? http://tutorialzine.com/2011/09/shuffle-letters-effect-jquery/
[00:31:24] <Ankabout> basically I want it to shuffle strings into each other, rather than out of nothing, and then loop
[00:52:21] <brianpWins> can you metaprogram a function? like I've made a new jquery function. so when I do a $(element).myFunction() i also want my function to create and bind to that element other functions
[00:53:03] <Cork> yes and no
[00:53:18] <Cork> add the function to .data('function name')
[00:53:35] <Cork> and then you add a wrapper around the original function
[00:53:42] <Cork> that calls your function
[00:53:47] <Cork> if it exists
[00:56:18] <cattlefraud> jQuery rules!
[00:56:28] <cattlefraud> Goodnight yall.
[00:59:20] <Cork> brianpWins: http://jsfiddle.net/DxhYA/
[00:59:27] <Cork> something like that
[01:00:22] <Cork> brianpWins: opps the original should be outside the loop http://jsfiddle.net/DxhYA/1/
[01:03:04] <brianpWins> Cork: thanks for the example. I think it's getting to what I need I'll play around with it =)
[01:06:31] <Hornet> is there a simple way to say 'remove classes from selection except X' ?
[01:15:42] <brianpWins> Hornet: like: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1467226/jquery-target-all-except
[01:16:23] <Hornet> that's a selector method
[01:16:33] <helpcrypto> hi all
[01:16:40] <Hornet> I have elements in my selection already, but I'd like to remove class foo, but nor bar
[01:16:51] <Hornet> without removing them all then re-adding bar
[01:16:52] <helpcrypto> i must be doing something wrong, trying to use $.post or $.ajax
[01:17:09] <helpcrypto> consider i have a form with id="myform"
[01:17:41] <ravenzz> ?not @ Hornet
[01:17:42] <bot-t> Hornet, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[01:17:43] <brianpWins> http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
[01:17:44] <helpcrypto> is $("myform").post=function(){...$.post(asdadasd)...} correct?
[01:17:59] <Hornet> read what I'm saying, not what you're reading it as
[01:18:07] <ravenzz> oh maybe you would to remove the class
[01:18:13] <brianpWins> removeClass will only remove a single class not all the classes
[01:18:52] <Hornet> I know it will... hence my question
[01:19:15] <Hornet> I suppose the way to do it is to enumerate over all the classes with .each and manually inspect
[01:19:25] <brianpWins> thats exactly what you said, remove a single class but not the rest
[01:19:43] <Hornet> no, I said remove all except a specified class
[01:20:10] <oquidave> how guys, ...i want to get all the checked items in a certain div..am trying somthg like $('#list_div input:checkbox:checked')
[01:20:25] <brianpWins> ahhh, i'm picking up what your putting down sorry it's late
[01:20:29] <oquidave> but it's not picking anything...
[01:21:06] <Hornet> try $('#list_div input[type=checkbox]:checked')
[01:21:19] <helpcrypto> its $("myform").submit(function(event){......$.ajax(...); }); ?
[01:21:25] <oquidave> Hornet, thanks let me try
[01:22:12] <oquidave> Hornet, no change
[01:22:34] <Hornet> ahh, but change must come from within :)
[01:22:44] <Hornet> not sure what your markup is tbh
[01:22:48] <Hornet> so can't be more specific
[01:23:45] <helpcrypto> what im trying its to send a form from my computer to a web page and receive the answer
[01:24:03] <helpcrypto> how could i allow cross-domain?
[01:24:16] <jQuy> it's a good question
[01:24:34] <oquidave> Hornet, okay, this div list_div in inside a parent div, so don't you think i have to follow the hirachy...like $('#parent_div #list_div input[type=checkbox]:checked')
[01:27:27] <helpcrypto> should i use $.support.cors = true; before $(document).ready ?
[01:27:42] <helpcrypto> can i use it inside a functoin?...
[01:27:56] <helpcrypto> if i dont use it, i get a transport error, while using it i get "unknown"
[01:29:54] <jayed> hi - IE7 and IE8 are hurting my feelings
[01:30:35] <dirkpennings> jayed, hehe yeah, it's a real "pain in the ass"..
[01:31:37] <jQuy> helpcrypto: one option is to use some server side language, Java, PHP etc.
[01:32:20] <helpcrypto> a "normal" form, witout jquery/ajax, works
[01:32:23] <jayed> val element = jQuery('<span id="something">'); jQuery(element).append('<p>hi<p>'); jQuery('#someid').(element); fails in ie8 and ie7
[01:32:34] <helpcrypto> send the request and shows the page
[01:32:55] <jayed> if no id attribute it works - or using document.createElement with full attribute
[01:32:58] <pallet> hi, in Javascript is there a string replace, ie check for 't' in a string and replace it with a 'c' ?
[01:34:08] <jQuy> pallet: yes
[01:34:10] <jayed> pallet: var string = "ate"; string.replace('t','c');
[01:34:21] <pallet> aweome
[01:34:28] <pallet> awesome, even
[01:38:29] <helpcrypto> when a form send some input values using POST
[01:38:31] <helpcrypto> are like an string like GET but hidden? (field1=value&field2=value...)
[01:40:28] <twoface> Hi. What could cause radio buttons from not being drawn as checked in ff and chrome, even with checked="checked" on them? It only does this when they are inside a datatable. $("input[type='radio']:checked").length = 0, $("input[type='radio'][checked='checked']").length = 4
[01:40:35] <twoface> $("input[type='radio']:checked").length
[01:40:38] <twoface> woops
[01:45:00] <brianpWins> do class methods exist in JS as opposed to instance methods?
[01:46:13] <quicksilver> well javascript doesn't have classes or instances
[01:46:24] <quicksilver> but you can call functions directly on prototypes
[01:46:29] <quicksilver> which has a similar function
[01:46:30] <jQuy> just objects and functions
[01:46:34] <quicksilver> Array.doSomething
[01:46:55] <SixSence> intuitive, i like it.
[01:47:09] <brianpWins> quarkimedes: so if i defined a class (or not a class) but I can do var myVar = new MyClass
[01:47:10] <helpcrypto> ok...i have found the possible error
[01:47:29] <helpcrypto> does anyone in here use a keygenhtml tag?
[01:47:42] <helpcrypto> has anyone serialized a form containing a html keygen tag?
[01:47:43] <brianpWins> so how can I attach method to MyClass so i can call them like MyClass.this_method instead of having to do myVar.this_method
[01:49:20] <jQuy> brianWins: why don't you use singletons?
[01:49:51] <quicksilver> brianpWins: do you understand what 'MyClass' actually is?
[01:50:12] <quicksilver> I think you need to go and read some basic tutorials about javascript and prototypes
[01:50:37] <quicksilver> you can indeed call MyClass.this_method but you need to invest a little time in understanding what that means.
[01:50:38] <brianpWins> quicksilver: i know what MyClass would be in a ruby context but it may not be the same in js
[01:50:42] <quicksilver> it is not.
[01:50:50] <quicksilver> as I said, javascript does not have classes
[01:50:53] <brianpWins> theres my confusion then
[01:51:00] <quicksilver> and it doesn't have instances in quite the same sense.
[01:51:02] <quicksilver> go read about it.
[01:53:29] <bjornbjorn>  I .post to an URL but always get the error callback function
[01:53:29] <bjornbjorn>                called with statusText "error" and errorThrown "undefined" .. in
[01:53:29] <bjornbjorn>                my post method I just have die("hello"); but seem to be unable
[01:53:29] <bjornbjorn>                to get any response at all .. the server status code returned is
[01:53:31] <bjornbjorn>                200
[01:53:41] <bjornbjorn> anyone know what's going on?
[01:58:20] <jayed>  /leave
[01:58:24] <jayed> exit
[02:01:31] <brianpWins> bjornbjorn: the few time i've gotten that it was a dataType issue
[02:02:18] <brianpWins> i was passing the wrong data type in for the result set and even thought the browser gets a 200 and probably the content I want jquery doesn't know how to handle it and throws the failure callback
[02:02:41] <brianpWins> so maybe check that out. otherwise I dunno. just happen to be what it was for me
[02:12:17] <DarsVaeda> hi, have a selector problem, I have elements with "class="fileupload thumbnails" when I do $('.fileupload, .thumbnails)" they are selected if I do $('.fileupload:not(.thumbnails))" they are not selected, but when I do $('.fileupload + .thumbnails)" they are not selected? any idea why?
[02:12:57] <alyosha> hi, i have a rotating banner using cycle plugin and i would like to have some sort of paging for rotating images. I know i can use "page: '#'div', " and it will give me all the pages but i would rather that it would look like " prev 1/16 next" not prev 1 2 3 4 5 ... next"
[02:13:16] <alyosha> you can see page here: http://storitve-dot.com/player/banner.html
[02:14:06] <alyosha> i realy don't know how to make this to loke like 1/17  and on
[02:15:40] <ussher_> could someone explain to my why id: $(this).attr('id'), does not contain the value i want anymore after adding .click(function........ ?  ORIGINAL: http://jsfiddle.net/kb2n5/  WITH .click: http://jsfiddle.net/william/kb2n5/1/  In the second one id=id instead of id=end_4
[02:16:37] <ussher_> think it has to do with the .each but not understanding since that comes after the bit before it.
[02:29:40] <quicksilver> ussher_: In your version "this" doesn't refer to anything in particular
[02:31:06] <ussher_> quicksilver: thanks for the help.  in the first 'this' gives the ID of the button which was clicked.  Thats what i want.
[02:31:35] <ussher_> so if its the left col it will be start_1  and the right col end_3  with different numbers depending on the box.
[02:32:09] <ussher_> its the submit URL after clicking OK thats different when viewed with paramters.
[02:32:43] <quicksilver> ussher_: I know.
[02:33:08] <quicksilver> ussher_: but in your edited one, you're not in a callback, so 'this' isn't set to the object.
[02:33:09] <ussher_> quicksilver: im sure you know better than me. cos im confused
[02:33:20] <quicksilver> Does more than one element match ".time" ?
[02:34:37] <ussher_> yes each of the times that are set on the page have a .time class.  but in the first example on jsfiddle the  id: $(this).attr('id') will set it as the box that was clicked. (so i know which table to update.)
[02:34:38] <stygyan> so, i've got something showing once you click a button.
[02:34:47] <stygyan> how can i get it to hide?
[02:35:15] <quicksilver> ussher_: Yes. That's because in the first example, it was inside a callback from "each"
[02:35:32] <quicksilver> ussher_: and one of the things "each" does is set 'this' each time to the element being considered.
[02:36:50] <ussher_> quicksilver: hmmm.  but it is working correctly without the each.  its when i add the .click and the .each that it stops submitting correctly.
[02:37:15] <quicksilver> ussher_: I don't believe you.
[02:37:38] <ussher_> quicksilver:  hahaha, its the same on the jsfiddle examples.  ill get the urls.
[02:37:55] <quicksilver> in your code without 'each', $(this).attr('id'),
[02:37:57] <ussher_> http://www.earner.iixxii.cc/apTimetracker.php?mode=tracker&t=edit&id=start_125&value=12%3A03
[02:38:00] <quicksilver> will be evaluated only once
[02:38:02] <ussher_> thats the first on
[02:38:05] <quicksilver> just listen to me.
[02:38:10] <ussher_> see id=start_125
[02:38:14] <quicksilver> in your code without 'each', $(this).attr('id'), will be evaluated only once
[02:38:17] <ussher_> thats what i want.
[02:38:24] <quicksilver> so each item will get the same "id:"
[02:39:21] <ussher_> thats what i want.  The ID of the start or end that was clicked on.  the each is added to remove any other selection boxes from anywhere else.
[02:39:42] <ussher_> quicksilver: really appreciate the help. thanks
[02:40:43] <ussher_> quicksilver: in the second example you can only have one selection box open at a time.  in the first you can have many.  closing the other selection boxes is what the each does.
[02:44:35] <mathi> hi
[02:44:54] <mathi> to get the current element in a .each() loop, should I use this or $(this) ?
[02:45:14] <quicksilver> this is the element
[02:45:22] <quicksilver> $(this) is a jquery object containing the element
[02:45:39] <mathi> quicksilver, "this" in the loop is not jQuery object ?
[02:45:48] <quicksilver> no, it's the DOM element
[02:45:59] <mathi> aaaaa ok thanks got it )
[02:47:44] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/XgShq/2/ why is it not selecting?
[02:48:39] <ravenzz> DarsVaeda because you are not including jQuery?
[02:48:52] <DarsVaeda> doh!
[02:49:06] <DarsVaeda> damn when did it deselect that -.-
[02:50:31] <mathi> I don't understand why var a = $(this).html();  (the element contains 'a string', and var a = 'a string' is not the same.
[02:50:52] <mathi> it gives different results
[02:51:08] <ravenzz> ?text @ mathi
[02:51:08] <bot-t> mathi, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[02:52:43] <topriddy> quick question please, how does one delete elements from an html, e.g rows from a table or items from a list please using ajax?
[02:53:11] <mathi> ravenzz, if the element contains 'a string', var a = $(this).text(); and var a = 'a string' still give different results from my function
[02:53:38] <ravenzz> ?demo @ mathi
[02:53:38] <bot-t> mathi, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:53:50] <ravenzz> topriddy do you need remove() ?
[02:53:53] <topriddy> did i phrase my question well?
[02:53:54] <mathi> ravenzz, hold a sec, i'll try to do this
[02:54:02] <ravenzz> ?remove @ topriddy
[02:54:02] <bot-t> topriddy, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[02:54:10] <ravenzz> yep I don't understand
[02:54:18] <topriddy> hmm...let me try remove.
[02:54:55] <topriddy> ravenzz: i have a table showing a list of records, users should be able to delete a selected row on click without a full server round trip
[02:55:36] <mathi> ravenzz, by creating the demo I noticed I did something stupid, I had not to take the content of the element, but the content in the title attribute, sorry! )
[02:55:56] <topriddy> ravenzz: what trick would i need to know the selected row, maybe attaching a number to the input button.
[02:56:02] <mathi> I hope you are not angry sorry
[02:56:13] <stygyan> hi guys, i've got a problem with sibling selectors.
[02:56:23] <DarsVaeda> how do I select an element that explicitly has class1 AND class2?
[02:56:32] <stygyan> i'm making a script that, when you hit an h4, it toggles on and off the following div.
[02:56:43] <stygyan> how can i make it at once, and not having to make one of them for every h4?
[02:56:52] <topriddy> but am wondering how jquery actually removes html from a page. skeptical even still
[02:57:31] <gnarf> stygyan: $("h4").click(function() { $(this).next().slideToggle(); });
[02:57:38] <Connor_> Hallo
[02:57:38] <stygyan> oh
[02:57:39] <ThePendulum> topriddy: It doesn't remove HTML from the source, it just orders your browser to display whatever you've asked your jQuery to display
[02:57:40] <stygyan> thank you
[02:57:46] <ThePendulum> Hoioi Connor, hoe gaat het?
[02:57:56] <gnarf> topriddy: it removes it from the DOM
[02:57:58] <Connor_> UK Sorry :P
[02:58:02] <Connor_> I just like saying Hallo :D
[02:58:16] <ThePendulum> It's Dutch, and I'm Dutch, so you shouldn't blame me for replying in Dutch! :D
[02:58:31] <Connor_> This is true :P
[02:58:34] <ThePendulum> Greetings anyway :)
[02:58:58] <Connor_> Could anyone help me with a Self executing function?
[02:59:44] <ThePendulum> Are there any webdev-guru's in here besides just jQuery? I'm having a problem most likely PHP-based, but I haven't found any helping hand yet. Perhaps some suggestions on other channels I could try if you refuse to help me because it's a jQ channel after all? :)
[02:59:49] <topriddy> ThePendulum: seen, thanks.
[02:59:55] <gnarf> Connor_: probably, but you'd have to ask a question first
[02:59:57] <ravenzz> topriddy http://jsfiddle.net/Ut996/
[03:00:23] <Connor_> Okay, well I have this JS: http://pastebin.com/gJutjKRw but it's throwing an error and im not sure why
[03:00:40] <Connor_> My goal is to remove the disabled attribute after the function is finished
[03:01:09] <ThePendulum> topriddy: It's like you ask your friend to colour a blank sheet of paper blue, and someone else asks him to colour it red after you. Your friend will colour it red because that was the last request he got.
[03:01:38] <gnarf> Connor_: umm... something already not making sense then
[03:02:03] <ussher_> quicksilver: i got it :) needed to move that $(this).attr('id'); down into the subitEdit() function and its all going.  Thanks for your help
[03:02:04] <gnarf> $('#our-products .content_heading select').removeAttr('disabled') is executed immediately, its result becomes array_of_categories
[03:02:06] <ussher_> quicksilver++
[03:02:47] <quicksilver> ussher_: glad you worked it out :)
[03:02:50] <dr0id> dr0id++
[03:02:50] <Lampoon> MmMMhmm. Right. You just k... /me sighs.
[03:03:28] <topriddy> ThePendulum: yeah true. the things that can be done with jquery+css+html seems really amazing
[03:04:46] <topriddy> ravenzz: oh thanks. just what i needed. :D
[03:05:11] <ThePendulum> meh.
[03:06:06] <ThePendulum> I finally managed to get a computer with a decent keyboard at my school's study center
[03:06:27] <ThePendulum> Usually, the space-key blocks, which is extremely annoying while typing a 2-page e-mail
[03:07:13] <stygyan> now, the final question
[03:07:24] <ThePendulum> The answer to life, the universe, and everything.
[03:07:25] <stygyan> how to change some css alternatively?
[03:07:28] <ThePendulum> 42
[03:07:55] <stygyan> for example, changing the background. first click, on, second click, off, etcetera.
[03:08:22] <ThePendulum> stygyan: Define 'alternatively', how are you doing it natively?
[03:08:37] <stygyan> hey, i know. my english sucks.
[03:08:50] <ravenzz> ?toggleClass @ stygyan
[03:08:54] <stygyan> thank you
[03:09:03] <ThePendulum> Oh that's not really the issue, it's more like I don't know what exactly you mean lol, which is an issue of mine
[03:09:11] <ravenzz> we don't have a bot anymore
[03:09:14] <ravenzz> :°
[03:09:17] <ThePendulum> Meh. Leisure time's over, sorry I'm not able to help. Seeya guys later ;-)
[03:09:49] <Spadeski> Sup everyone
[03:10:54] <ravenzz> Sup e lat (Soup of milk in Neapolitan)
[03:11:31] <stygyan> it's not a problem, ravenzz, i found the toggleclass thingie :D
[03:11:49] <ravenzz> gr8
[03:12:03] <g0rd0n> i need a context menu that i can bind using .live(), i tried with http://abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/09/jquery-context-menu-plugin/ but for some reason it does not work... is there any other plugin you can recommend?
[03:12:55] <dirkpennings> when using jQuery.fn.extend(); with a few functions, how van I use $ in that functions when using jQuery.noConflict();
[03:14:25] <quicksilver> dirkpennings: function($) { $.fn.extend({ .... stuff which uses $ .... }) }(jQuery);
[03:16:21] <dirkpennings> quicksilver, thanks! slight change: (function($) { $.fn.extend({ .... stuff which uses $ .... }) })(jQuery);
[03:16:42] <quicksilver> dirkpennings: yes, that's the one :)
[03:16:47] <dirkpennings> thanks a lot :)
[03:33:40] <Ankabout> can anyone help me on the way to changing this function a bit? http://tutorialzine.com/2011/09/shuffle-letters-effect-jquery/
[03:33:40] <cmaan> Hello. I am on my iphone. So hard to show code. Iam sending json data with jquery ajax function and getting some data back. Succsess callback works on firefox and opera but not on chrome ie and safari. In this browser the error callback goes alive. Anyone has a quick tip?
[03:33:43] <Ankabout> basically I want it to shuffle strings into each other, rather than out of nothing, and then loop
[03:44:42] <jiduvah> hello everybody, I am hoping somebody can help me with some newbie questions to help me speed up my learning
[03:45:04] <dr0id> no
[03:45:16] <jiduvah> I am actually using jquery mobile, but I want to use tabs seen here http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138085/Tabs
[03:45:48] <jiduvah> jquery mobile doesn't seem to have any docs on tabs so will it still be possible
[03:48:58] <Whirl3d> can input elements have data objects? $("input[name='test']").data('validate',someRegexp); ?
[03:49:47] <quicksilver> as far as I know all elements can have data
[03:50:31] <Spadeski> quicksilver: Would you midn taking a look at my site and maybe giving me something to do wit hit lol ?
[03:50:39] <Whirl3d> quicksilver, thanks for the reply. Can you store jquery objects in an elements data object?
[03:51:09] <shesek> you can store whatever you want there
[03:51:26] <shesek> including objects of any kind, including jQuery objects
[03:51:47] <Whirl3d> shesek, I can't seem to get it to work correctly. I'll fiddle it and maybe you could see what I am doing wrong...thanks for your help
[03:53:37] <cmaan> cmaan Hello. I am on my iphone. So hard to show code. Iam sending json data with jquery ajax function and getting some data back. Succsess callback works on firefox and opera but not on chrome ie and safari. In this browser the error callback goes alive. Anyone has a quick tip?
[04:01:02] <topriddy> please how do i add data to a form submit that is not part of the form input elements
[04:01:29] <jQuy> use hidden fields
[04:01:59] <jQuy> or create json-object from form fields and send it by ajax
[04:02:03] <donCams> that, or add to json obj
[04:02:09] <donCams> crap
[04:02:21] <jQuy> domCams: :)
[04:03:15] <donCams> but then again, if you're paranoid about users disabling js in their browser, use hidden fields :P
[04:03:43] <donCams> seriously, what's the % of users disabling javascript?
[04:03:43] <jQuy> paranoid is the word
[04:03:53] <ghost1k> i wonder if these users still exist
[04:04:14] <donCams> even mobile browsers support javascript
[04:06:14] <Spadeski> http://gotactics.net16.net/?gp=home
[04:06:18] <Spadeski> I need ideas people
[04:06:31] <donCams> Spadeski, paid consulting?
[04:06:33] <xckpd7> you can never guarantee that your javascript is bug free
[04:07:22] <Cmaan> Now i'm on pc. http://jsfiddle.net/p3Zfc/ . All works fine in Opera and Firefox. In Chrome, Safari and ie the error callback gives me the alert. Why? Need more information?
[04:07:42] <Spadeski> donCams nah cant pay broski
[04:08:01] <donCams> jk bro
[04:08:27] <Nuck> Haha, yayQuery is 4.1GB of my 30GB music folder
[04:08:33] <Nuck> hooray for yayQuery!
[04:09:13] <jQuy> Is it possible to earn by developing jQuery?
[04:09:44] <Spadeski> ok how do i set a song to play in jPlayer?
[04:10:42] <aaronmcadam> yayQuery rules I love it
[04:10:44] <topriddy> jQuy: hello
[04:10:52] <aaronmcadam> just wish it was more regular :( the guys are really busy
[04:10:57] <jQuy> topriddy: hi
[04:12:47] <jQuy> topriddy: what's up?
[04:12:48] <misterm> ha indeed, it's my favorite "couple times a year" podcast
[04:15:10] <aaronmcadam> no pms please
[04:15:18] <donCams> pms?
[04:15:41] <aaronmcadam> PMs
[04:16:09] <donCams> heh
[04:18:58] <topriddy> jQuy: by using hidden fields, how would i get multiple values for like say a multiple <option> input
[04:20:44] <gnarf> topriddy: huh?
[04:21:40] <topriddy> i mean i have a <select> <option> that allows users add in values, now i want to submit all the values.
[04:21:43] <jQuy> topriddy: i'm not sure if I understood right
[04:22:27] <jQuy> topriddy: If you have <select type='multiple'>, all the selected values are submitted automatically
[04:23:10] <topriddy> again, i have <select> <option></option></select> the users can add item into the list with javascript. on form submission i want to submit all the items in it whether they are selected or not
[04:23:12] <jQuy> topriddy: sorry, <select multiple>
[04:24:00] <jQuy> topriddy: you can create hidden field and add all the values into it before submitting the form
[04:25:26] <norbi> hi guys, please help, im using this jcrop: http://deepliquid.com/projects/Jcrop/demos.php?demo=advanced, and im getting jquery_api.setOptions() not defined on this code: http://pastebin.com/aav86JRu
[04:25:29] <topriddy> jQuy: like use javascript to set the value of an input type=text hidden field as a csv values which gets submitted. or just put json inside and then pase
[04:25:44] <norbi> Jcrop is applied on a img object
[04:26:40] <jQuy> topriddy: you can put the values into the field just how you like to, for example separating them with semicolon
[04:27:23] <jQuy> jQuy: i prefer json objects
[04:27:39] <jQuy> whups....
[04:27:49] <jQuy> topriddy: i prefer json objects
[04:30:11] <kaputtmacher> hi all
[04:30:25] <norbi> any idea?
[04:30:26] <topriddy>  jQuy: sorry to take much your time. like you said you prefer json, hence you would put json in the hidden input text field
[04:30:54] <PrinceES> how can i display the title over each image on the slider(jcarousel)?
[04:31:18] <norbi> jcrop_api.destroy is not a function
[04:31:24] <norbi> ?
[04:31:26] <jQuy> topriddy: no problem and sorry about my english
[04:32:31] <gnarf> topriddy: what is your backend?
[04:32:33] <jQuy> topriddy: usually I prefer json structure that I send to server by ajax but in your case I think it's easier to put values into some <input type="hidden" ... field and submit the form without ajax
[04:35:17] <jQuy> topriddy: just a small js script attached to submit button
[04:35:48] <PrinceES> i want to display the title on the image <a href="#" class="show_hide" title="My Image Title" <img src="images/1.jpg>" width="279" height="101" alt="#"/></a> .. I am using jcarousel plugin please help me out
[04:36:08] <norbi> solved...
[04:38:39] <Whirl3d> Can someone please suggest a simple, lightweight validation script for a simple contact form?
[04:39:42] <ghost1k> Whirl3d: write your own :) It's very easy
[04:40:59] <topriddy> gnarf: java servlets
[04:41:08] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I don't have the discipline to write it without going overboard.
[04:41:49] <Whirl3d> Every time I start, I think "it would be more polymorphic if I did...." and that's all she wrote.
[04:42:08] <Whirl3d> double up on the adderal I guess.
[04:42:22] <ghost1k> :D
[04:43:07] <Spadeski> anyone here specialize in jquery audio ?
[04:44:07] <jQuy> Whirl3d: google jquery tools
[04:44:35] <ghost1k> Whirl3d: this one is great, once i used it http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[04:45:03] <ghost1k> it might seem a bit complicated though, but works good
[04:45:06] <jQuy> ghost1k: yes, i have used it too
[04:45:59] <jQuy> but jquery tools library is very good too
[04:46:35] <jQuy> you can customize your download on jquery tools site
[04:47:02] <jQuy> and the plugins really work
[04:48:10] <Whirl3d> Thanks for the input jQuy, ghost1k, I guess I am just gonna stick with my ugly regexp validation...the plugins you both mention are great for bigger projects.
[04:48:42] <Whirl3d> but this is totally overkill. the client doesn't care if he gets invalid submissions, I do though. LOL
[04:49:08] <Whirl3d> still, thanks for the input.
[04:49:12] <ghost1k> ok, good luck then
[04:49:13] <jQuy> Whirl3D: as you wish :)
[04:49:51] <jQuy> Whirl3D: no problm
[04:50:22] <kalle2> hi, im using jquery autocomplete. how can i automatically fill in the rest of a form when an option from the autocomplete is chosen?
[04:51:00] <Chibby_> could anyone please tell me how i can chang the value of a select element? searching the api for "select" is not a pleasant experience (:
[04:51:48] <jQuy> kalle2: there are callback function on autocomplete component, use them
[04:54:01] <jQuy> kalle2: you have to write some code for filling in the form
[04:55:01] <kalle2> jquy, yes, but im having trouble returning the result (php) to the script
[04:55:22] <jQuy> kalle2: oh, so it's a server side problem
[04:57:36] <jQuy> Chibby_: have you tried this $("select[name='testing']").find("option[value=''something]").attr("selected", "selected");
[04:57:58] <jQuy> Chibby_: there is a typo, sorry
[05:00:30] <apollo13> hi, why doesn't jQuery('<html><head><title>apo</title></head></html>').find('title') return anything?
[05:00:57] <aaronmcadam> cuz it doesn't work like that apollo
[05:01:02] <aaronmcadam> find works on children
[05:01:37] <apollo13> so is this: https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax/blob/master/jquery.pjax.js#L102 suppoes to fail too?
[05:02:05] <AdTaylor> Hi. Strange question. I have a string and I want to replace all instances of " ' " with " \'  ". So that the string contains \' and I can output it to a textarea that is building some javascript. Does anyone have any ideas on how to do it? (aka str.replace(/'/g , "\'") but working :) )
[05:02:12] <aaronmcadam> basically to do that you'd have to append it to the dom
[05:02:56] <aaronmcadam> nah
[05:03:05] <aaronmcadam> that won't work AdTaylor you'd have to escape the quote
[05:03:10] <apollo13> aaronmcadam: hmm defunkt usually knows what he's doing and this code is in use by github, so that confuses me a bit
[05:03:34] <aaronmcadam> he must be doin something jiggery-pokery related
[05:04:04] <aaronmcadam> anyway why are you creating a fragment of a whole html document there
[05:04:38] <apollo13> I am not, the server returns the whole page which is passed as data to success, then it's supposed to get the fragment out of it
[05:04:42] <gnarf> apollo13: the problem you're having is that you can't put some of those tags inside of a DIV
[05:04:56] <aaronmcadam> hey gnarf
[05:04:57] <gnarf> you might have some luck with trying to $.parseXML on it
[05:05:01] <gnarf> ?parseXML
[05:05:02] <bot-t> gnarf, jQuery.parseXML() - Parses a string into an XML document. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseXML/
[05:05:07] <apollo13> gnarf: what am I putting into a div?
[05:05:44] <aaronmcadam> sounds pretty hacky
[05:05:45] <gnarf> anything you pass into a $( htmlstring ) - not literally but effectively is like inserting it into a div
[05:05:52] <aaronmcadam> grabbing a title from a template
[05:06:02] <gnarf> ?g jquery find title tag ajax data
[05:06:04] <bot-t> gnarf, jQuery.get() – jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[05:06:37] <AdTaylor> member:aaronmcadam is there a way to escape the escape? (if that makes any sense)
[05:06:47] <apollo13> whatever the bot returned there, I doubt that's the correct doc :Ã¾
[05:07:28] <jQuy> apollo13: so... did you get an answer to your question?
[05:07:40] <gnarf> actually apollo13
[05:07:48] <gnarf> try .filter("title")
[05:07:50] <gnarf> you should find it
[05:08:00] <gnarf> the <html> and the <head> tag are getting gobbled up
[05:08:20] <apollo13> jupp filter works
[05:08:20] <gnarf> <title> is the only tag that survives the innerHTML parse
[05:08:59] <jQuy> apollo13: $("html").find("title")
[05:09:02] <gnarf> you can verify yourself by doing jQuery('<html><head><title>apo</title></head></html>')[0] on the console
[05:09:54] <apollo13> gnarf: intresting I could swear that I had textnode etc there before
[05:10:07] <gnarf> apollo13: ^^^ find only finds "children"
[05:10:29] <apollo13> yeah thx, patching that pjax thingy now ;)
[05:10:37] <jQuy> apollo13: title is a child of html element
[05:11:37] <apollo13> jQuy: na it's supposed to be a child of head
[05:12:40] <gnarf> <html> and <head> are not valid tags to pass in as strings to $()
[05:12:47] <gnarf> they get "gobbled"
[05:12:58] <apollo13> gnarf: yes I got that now, it works, thx for the help
[05:14:00] <m1chael> im working on this form: http://mal.icuinternet.com/ # i want to select a customer and then have an ajax function grab some json (some customer data) and then pre-fill some text boxes with the customer data. i've got the function that runs when a customer is chosen.. for some reason my test json isn't working (no errors are reported thru firefox) any ideas? the code seems simple enough
[05:14:05] <ipo> hi
[05:14:07] <ipo> please help me
[05:14:23] <jQuy> apollo13: you are right, but .find() finds all the children no matter if there are direct children or not
[05:14:27] <ipo> how to make right to left command in div tag with javascript?
[05:14:36] <apollo13> jQuy: yes but not in my case, see what gnarf said
[05:14:43] <jQuy> apollo: grand children too :)
[05:15:14] <apollo13> please read what gnarf said it still won't workâ€¦
[05:16:06] <jQuy> apollo13: i'm out
[05:17:07] <kalle2> how can i get the selected item from autocomplete?
[05:18:01] <jQuy> kalle2: I think it's one of the parameters of the callback function
[05:20:12] <kalle2> jquy, yeah thanks, it was onSelect, belive it or not
[05:20:40] <jQuy> kalle2: no problem
[05:27:34] <jQuy> have a good weekend!
[05:33:48] <bgy> hi
[05:34:19] <bgy> is it a correct to do "$('.foo').live('click', 'keyup', function(event) {Â }); ?
[05:36:26] <erichynds> bgy: .live("click keyup", fn)
[05:36:45] <bgy> erichynds: ah yeah right :) thanks
[05:37:27] <bgy> actually I was wondering if it was .live('click, keyup') (not 'click', 'keyup' as I typed)
[05:38:10] <ipo> how to set RTL or LTR with jquery?
[05:39:16] <jiduvah> i am having a few problems, I have a listview but the text is over lapping with an item can anybody tell me what is wrong please
[05:39:18] <jiduvah> http://pastebin.com/d9gWWfbx
[05:39:27] <bgy> ipo: what do you mean? rtl/ltr are just element attributes it doens't depend on jquery
[05:40:16] <erichynds> bgy: no, that won't work
[05:40:21] <ipo> bgy, I make a simple wysiwyg , I need rtl/ltr in this editor. but I dont know command
[05:40:53] <bgy> ipo: just use css property direction: rtl;
[05:41:34] <ipo> bgy, how? I have div with contenteditable properties, how to set on a line?
[05:41:39] <bgy> ipo: it reverse the flow direction from left to right to right to left
[05:41:58] <bgy> $('#editor').attr('direction', 'rtl'); I guess
[05:43:20] <ipo> bgy, in div a selected a line! I want to set on line selected.
[05:44:02] <bgy> ipo: well wrap your line into a <span /> and apply the css property
[05:45:05] <jiduvah> could anybody give me an idea?
[05:46:45] <ipo> bgy , wait I check!
[05:47:43] <bgy> ipo: using contenteditable attribute may be a bit different with such behavior, but the workflow would be to get the current selection and wrap it in a span to which you apply direction: rtl; css property
[05:48:08] <ipo> ok
[05:48:14] <ipo> wait a sec
[05:51:51] <ipo> bgy, how to get seletion part with jquery?
[05:52:11] <bgy> ipo: not sure but I think it's document.selection
[05:52:29] <ipo> ok
[05:52:30] <ipo> wait
[05:53:00] <ipo> var sp = document.getSelection();alert(sp.parent());
[05:53:09] <ipo> bgy, cant work!
[05:53:15] <ipo> var sp = document.getSelection();alert(sp.parent());
[05:53:30] <bgy> ipo document.selection not document.getSelection()
[05:53:33] <bgy> it's not a method
[05:53:37] <g0rd0n> i have a dialog which is bound to a div class, but when the dialog opens i want to get the id of the div that driggered the dialog. how can i do that?
[05:54:27] <ipo> bgy, I have error on sp.parent()
[05:54:42] <ipo> that say me parent is not a function!
[05:54:56] <bgy> sp is not a jquery object
[05:55:11] <bgy> selection won't return an element anyway
[05:55:39] <ipo> that send me selection part! but I cant get parent
[05:55:47] <[[M]ax]> anyone in here know why ceebox would open twice if a link is clicked twice instead of just opening one?
[05:58:43] <nascro> What is the standard jQuery way to remove an input's value onfocus?
[06:00:08] <Techdeck`> $("input.someInput").focus(function() { $(this).val("") });
[06:00:40] <nascro> @Techdeck` thank you
[06:00:45] <Techdeck`> but if you're looking to build 'placeholder', you might as well use a plugin as there are probably hundreds of them
[06:01:05] <Cmaan> http://jsfiddle.net/qazva/  Im getting "SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL {arguments=[1], ...}" and "parseerror" if I click on the button. I have this problem only in Chrome, Safari and IEA not in Opera and not in Firefox. A few more minutes and ill enrage.
[06:01:06] <nail_> or use html5 placeholders
[06:01:20] <Techdeck`> html5 placeholders are not working in old browsers, which sucks
[06:01:22] <Techdeck`> :\
[06:01:30] <nail_> to hell with old browsers :)
[06:01:34] <nascro> @Techdeck` @nail_ define placeholders
[06:01:41] <Techdeck`> nascro, google is your friend
[06:02:44] <nascro> @Techdeck` Wow, I wasn't aware of placeholders.
[06:02:48] <nascro> For others' reference: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/input-placeholder
[06:03:29] <Techdeck`> nascro, in html5 it's supported natively, all you do is add placeholder="whatever" to your input and you're done
[06:03:34] <Techdeck`> problem is older browsers...
[06:03:47] <Techdeck`> so there are plugins that can detect if you have that capability, if not they will use JS to do so
[06:04:26] <Wilrod^> Hi, IÂ´m trying to find a good alternative to frames for aggregating a UI with content from multiple/individual websites. Any good way of doing this with ajax?
[06:04:33] <Techdeck`> nascro, and just so you know, regarding your question from earlier, now think about a password field and how that won't work :P
[06:05:00] <pachet> load@ Wilrod^
[06:05:18] <nascro> Yeah, I thought about that. Fortunately, current form doesn't deal with a password... Plain old contact form.
[06:05:45] <Wilrod^> pachet,, Yeah but itÂ´s not just "simple" dead content.ItÂ´s a whole interface
[06:06:22] <Wilrod^> So how can I inject interactive content and be sure that it wil lstill work
[06:06:44] <Wilrod^> What do I have to think about etc
[06:07:50] <Techdeck`> sounds like you should use a server to help you, Will|
[06:07:52] <Techdeck`> Wilrod^*
[06:08:13] <Techdeck`> if you dont have cross-domain issues doing that with ajax should be easy
[06:08:41] <Techdeck`> or use iframe's +  a proxy on your side. Then you will be able to manipulate the iframes
[06:09:23] <Wilrod^> Techdeck`: No corss-domain problems
[06:10:05] <Techdeck`> then just fetch the data with $.ajax, and shove it into the divs you want
[06:10:09] <Wilrod^> Techdeck`: but letÂ´s say the injected content have forms etc, wouldnt that be a problem?
[06:10:34] <Techdeck`> iframe + proxy would solve that
[06:10:59] <Wilrod^> ok, so just doing html injection with ajax would be problematic that casethen?
[06:11:23] <Techdeck`> you need to know what is that data you're getting
[06:11:31] <Techdeck`> if you don't, you might as well let whoever does handle it
[06:11:35] <Techdeck`> (which is the hosting site)
[06:11:36] <Wilrod^> Techdeck`: could you explain what the proxy should do?
[06:11:59] <Techdeck`> let's say you want to add cnn.com as a frame to your site
[06:12:47] <Techdeck`> you are on http://www.domain.com ... the proxy to cnn is on http://www.domain.com/proxy/cnn.com -- you just add an iframe to that proxy URL and then you wont have any cross-domain issues and you can manipulate the iframe as you please
[06:13:56] <Wilrod^> Ok I get the cross domain thing but what exactly does the proxy
[06:14:34] <Wilrod^> redirecting?
[06:14:56] <Wilrod^> doign webrequest
[06:15:20] <Techdeck`> it's a proxy to whatever it is you want to show
[06:15:38] <Techdeck`> a proxy meaning you will get all the data to that site you want from the proxy and not from the original url
[06:15:47] <Wilrod^> Ok
[06:15:56] <Techdeck`> once you dont have security issues on the iframes, you can run JS in them, change their DOM etc
[06:15:59] <Wilrod^> But I dont think I have cross domain problems
[06:16:11] <Techdeck`> so just use iframes as is
[06:16:14] <Techdeck`> without a proxy
[06:16:16] <ghost1k> Wilrod^: check this url, maybe it will help http://stackoverflow.com/questions/153152/resizing-an-iframe-based-on-content
[06:16:47] <Wilrod^> But iframe is preferable to a just injecting html into a div in this case then
[06:17:55] <Wilrod^> Or what say you?
[06:20:56] <bjensen> I need to get the browser to scroll to the an element where there is an error. Do I still need to use a plugin like ScrollTo or does query have some built in magic now?
[06:21:44] <pachet> bjensen: its usually pretty easy to calculate yourself
[06:22:15] <Wilrod^> Techdeck`: Is it a bad idea or not trying to use a ajax to div approach in my case?
[06:22:21] <bjensen> pachet: Im looking for a function that just takes a query object as an option and scrolls to that
[06:22:46] <Techdeck`> Wilrod^, I wouldn't use it when the data you receive is ambigious, if you know exactly what you're getting and the way to parse it, then ajax is a good idea
[06:23:38] <xec> does anyone know of any neat plugin that would let you get suggestions for tags in the middle of a text area?
[06:25:04] <miss_spelling> Hi all, I'm creating an iframe to load ads into however if I use iframedoc.close(); after doing a iframedoc.open() iframedoc.write() opera and ie don't run the document.write script
[06:25:11] <miss_spelling> any suggestions?
[06:25:36] <Wilrod^> Techdeck`: You know if thereÂ´s any downside when using iframes?
[06:26:41] <kborchers> bjensen: you could probably do something like $(elementToScroll).scrollTop($(elementToScrollTo).offset().top);  this would all depend on how your elements are laid out and the css used to position them but something like that will work
[06:27:17] <Techdeck`> Wilrod^, if you dont have security issues I can't think of anything special
[06:28:10] <Wilrod^> Techdeck`: I have
[06:28:54] <bjensen> kborchers: its the browser I need to scroll up to the element that has an error
[06:29:21] <pachet> bjensen: function scrollToElem(elem){$('html').stop().animate({scrollTop:elem.offset().top});}
[06:29:41] <pachet> theres a couple of cross browser issues youd need to address but thats the basic approach
[06:30:07] <kborchers> bjensen: $(window).scrollTop should do it i believe
[06:31:08] <kborchers> if jsfiddle didn't suck every morning i would throw something together for you
[06:31:15] <kborchers> ?down jsfiddle.net
[06:31:22] <bot-t> kborchers, It's not just you! - http://jsfiddle.net looks down from here.

[06:58:40] <DudesLoveMadonna> Is anyone using sizzleJS?
[07:03:18] <ipo> how to insert text in pointer position
[07:03:19] <ipo> ?
[07:05:31] <nail_> ipo: absolutely position your text, you can get the pointer position with the pageX and pageY attributes of the event
[07:05:59] <ipo> nail_, pinter in textarea or div
[07:06:06] <ipo> pointer
[07:07:40] <nail_> what?
[07:07:59] <erichynds> the caret position in an input?
[07:08:10] <ipo> nail_, I wanna find cursor in input tag
[07:08:17] <nail_> oh
[07:08:22] <ipo> erichynds, yes
[07:08:47] <erichynds> ?mdc getRangeAt
[07:08:48] <bot-t> erichynds, getRangeAt - MDN - Returns a range object representing one of the ranges currently selected. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Selection/getRangeAt
[07:09:08] <erichynds> that's a good starting point at least.
[07:09:22] <ipo> this have browser problems!
[07:09:24] <erichynds> it's not cross-browser either, so you'll have to implement createTextRange() in IE browsers
[07:10:04] <erichynds> I'm sure someone has created an abstraction script you could probably google
[07:10:10] <nail_> Never tried it, but there's http://plugins.jquery.com/project/fieldselection
[07:10:24] <denisesballs> hey all, can someone help me with my jquery tablesorter problem? for some reason my custom parser isnt working when my first row doesn't have a letter at the end of it - http://sabresboard.com/random/tablesort/
[07:10:35] <DudesLoveMadonna> Is Internet Explorer 9 a good browser?
[07:11:04] <ipo> Thanks
[07:11:22] <ipo> Thanks so much
[07:11:33] <denisesballs> both tables are identical except in the first one (which is sorting properly) the first <td> is 0.00k and in the second (not working) the <td> is 0.00 (without the k)
[07:11:56] <DudesLoveMadonna> nail_: Imagine being a eukaryotic organism going through mitosis inside Madonna as her child--the creation of yourself as a new spirit in this world within Madonna.
[07:12:07] <Bouska> hi
[07:13:00] <Bouska> someone can help me about the tablesorter plugin ?
[07:13:11] <Kambfhase> ?ask @ Bouska
[07:13:12] <bot-t> Bouska, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:13:25] <DudesLoveMadonna> Bouska: Imagine being a eukaryotic organism going through mitosis inside Madonna as her child--the creation of yourself as a new spirit in this world within Madonna.
[07:13:32] <DudesLoveMadonna> err, typo
[07:13:42] <nail_> Mmmh
[07:13:51] <nail_> ipo: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/field_selection that looks more up to date
[07:14:10] <pachet> probably just get nixed by the leftover freebase in her colon five seconds into life cycle true or falso
[07:14:44] <DudesLoveMadonna> false
[07:14:59] <Kambfhase> i like eukaryots
[07:15:12] <Bouska> http://tablesorter.com/docs/example-meta-headers.html this doesn't work for me neither a friend, that normal or not ?
[07:15:36] <DudesLoveMadonna> Madonna is the universal mother I think. That's why I grew up wanting her as my mommy.
[07:16:52] <Bouska> DudesLoveMadonna: i think my knowledge in biology is insufficient to understand (as well as my english)
[07:17:01] <Kambfhase> universal mother? tell that the mitochondrion dna.
[07:18:19] <nail_> Bouska: you mean, it doesn't work on that page? or you can't get it working on yours
[07:18:54] <denisesballs> anyone checking out my tablesort question?
[07:19:04] <ipo> nail_, Thanks
[07:19:32] <DarsVaeda> how can I turn a string into an array? (to use .unique() ) on it?
[07:19:59] <erichynds> .split()
[07:20:10] <DarsVaeda> any string
[07:20:20] <erichynds> also, unique only works on an array of DOM elements
[07:20:27] <DudesLoveMadonna> Kambfhase: Madonna makes my mitochondria warm.
[07:21:00] <SupremeLeader> You're to old for Madonna
[07:21:32] <anubis> Madonna is too old for Madonna
[07:21:33] <Kambfhase> DudesLoveMadonna: yeah, i think Madonna makes everyones ATP level rise
[07:21:34] <nail_> denisesballs: you don't tell tablesorter to use your parser
[07:21:37] <Bouska> nail_: both of them, I just can't disable tablesorter using metadata
[07:21:55] <denisesballs> nail_: it should autodetect it
[07:22:00] <denisesballs> like the first table does properly
[07:22:09] <ciss> hi! using jquery 1.2.6, this line inside a function crashes ie6, but works fine on ie7 and other browsers:
[07:22:15] <ciss> var Drupal = $.extend(true, {}, window.Drupal);
[07:22:18] <denisesballs> thats what the return s.match like is for
[07:22:25] <denisesballs> line*
[07:22:34] <ciss> any ideas or alternatives?
[07:22:46] <Kambfhase> ciss: thou shall not use jQ 1.2.6
[07:23:09] <ciss> Kambfhase: i'm not using it by choice
[07:23:10] <nail_> nor IE6 :D
[07:23:29] <denisesballs> in the second table which isn't working, if i simply add a 'k' to the '0.00' of the first row, the parser works properly like in the first table. for some reason if the first column in the code doesn't have a letter, the parser isn't working, even though other columns dont have letter suffixes
[07:23:32] <Kambfhase> Even Drrupal ahs mechanisms for updating jQuery.
[07:23:40] <Blazento> what are my options here. should i be using animate here? I have li elements in a ul. i want them to slowly scroll accross the screen 5 at a time, though i want them to come on and go off the screen one by one, so not in batches of 5
[07:24:22] <ciss> ok, i'm aware this is a terrible combination (like burning oil and water), but i'd still be grateful for suggestions that don't involve changing the jquery version or browser
[07:25:33] <Whirl3d> has anybody had problems with a browser's autofill not registering values for input fields
[07:26:26] <erichynds> Whirl3d: autofill won't populate w/ autocomplete="off"
[07:26:26] <Kambfhase> ciss: do you get an error message od does it just crash?
[07:27:20] <Whirl3d> erichynds, I want to be able to use the autofill feature, but it's not registering values (though I can see them)
[07:27:32] <erichynds> dunno :/
[07:28:11] <Whirl3d> once I focus the input element, the value shows up in jquery's $.val() but not before (even though the value is there..)
[07:28:18] <nail_> denisesballs: I suspect tablesorter to autodetect it as a number and then ignore your own parser then
[07:28:35] <nail_> so try enforcing it
[07:28:40] <ciss> Kambfhase: it just crashes but provides an error report
[07:28:45] <denisesballs> oh, because it matched one parser before another...
[07:28:48] <nail_> yep
[07:28:49] <denisesballs> duh
[07:28:49] <Kambfhase> hmmm
[07:29:09] <ciss> tried 1.3.2, same issue. can't upgrade to higher versions
[07:29:23] <denisesballs> i thought it tried to match all the data before picking a parser
[07:29:27] <denisesballs> that makes sense now
[07:29:55] <kaputtmacher> hi there
[07:30:08] <denisesballs> thanks nail_
[07:30:18] <kaputtmacher> I'm trying to nest two cycle plugins within my webpage
[07:30:19] <ciss> Kambfhase: my guess is that the recursion during the deep copy is too much for ie6
[07:30:31] <nail_> denisesballs: welcome
[07:30:44] <kaputtmacher> my html markup differs a bit from malsup's example
[07:31:13] <Kambfhase> could be, whats that Drupal object? and is the var Drupal assignment in the global namespace?
[07:33:01] <dgx> Can I use jQuery to find if a select option has been clicked/selected?
[07:33:30] <Kambfhase> dgx: yes.
[07:33:46] <dgx> Can you recommend a way or a reference to read?
[07:34:51] <Kambfhase> http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[07:35:33] <DudesLoveMadonna> Jquery is so web 2.0. We need something web 3.0.
[07:36:03] <dgx> Thanks
[07:36:09] <ciss> Kambfhase: Drupal is a registry object added by the Drupal CMS. it stores any settings or init callbacks required by modules. as far as i can see the nesting can extend to five levels
[07:36:59] <Bouska> nail_: is there a way to check if it's a problem from the browser (i've already tested with two webkit browser and firefox, so i doubt) or from the library there http://tablesorter.com/docs/example-meta-headers.html
[07:37:16] <xec> does anyone know of any neat plugin that would let you get suggestions for tags in the middle of a text area?
[07:37:31] <Distilled> So I have this page which uses the jquery datatables plugin, and once our datatable starts to exceed ~200 rows it really, really starts to slow down.
[07:37:55] <Distilled> I'm running Chrome's Speed Tracer, but I'm not sure what I'm looking for in the results. I see a lot of Layouts, Parse HTMLs, and Style Recalculations.
[07:38:21] <Distilled> Any suggestions on how I can improve the browsers performance when handling this much information?
[07:38:40] <Kambfhase> ciss:  have you tried without deep?
[07:40:30] <nail_> Bouska: on that page it can't load jquery.metadata.js, it sends back a 404
[07:40:30] <iJack2Madonna> Distilled: Yes.
[07:40:31] <imajes> hey, is there a better way than binding an action on the event/ live("mouseover" ... when i have a hidden div which contains actions, and then i show it sometime during the flow?
[07:41:32] <ciss> Kambfhase: shallow copies work
[07:41:37] <imajes> or are there any other events that i can bind to that don't require the user to do something?
[07:41:45] <imajes> i'd like to bind before the mouseover, not just in time of it
[07:42:13] <iJack2Madonna> onbeforemouseover
[07:42:30] <imajes> that's a real thing?
[07:42:37] <iJack2Madonna> Don't listen to trolls.
[07:42:56] <iJack2Madonna> onmousenter maybe imajes?
[07:42:59] <imajes> hrm
[07:42:59] <Kambfhase> you keep me trolling, they hatin'.
[07:43:05] <Distilled> iJack2Madonna, such as?
[07:43:16] <Bouska> nail_: interresting catch, i will investigate that, thank you :)
[07:43:17] <ciss> Kambfhase: of course this doesn't help my problem :)
[07:43:22] <Distilled> Or maybe there's just a page with some tips that I can reference
[07:43:30] <imajes> i'm more interested in  'on event visibility'
[07:43:44] <iJack2Madonna> imajes: Yo, check it: http://www.bennadel.com/blog/1805-jQuery-Events-MouseOver-MouseOut-vs-MouseEnter-MouseLeave.htm
[07:45:06] <Kambfhase> ciss: is your page live?
[07:46:55] <imajes> those are great iJack2Madonna
[07:47:13] <imajes> but i really am trying to find an event that's much earlier than mouseover
[07:47:48] <Kambfhase> DomContentLoaded?
[07:48:26] <ries> Getns, good morning, can I create a custom event where some other plugins can subscribe on? For example a event 'productChanged', then some other widgets on my screen can respond to such event?
[07:49:00] <cmonster> hey, I am loading a php page that has a script tag in it which loads an Iframe. The div that contains the script is there, but there is no javascript, or content inside the div after the ajax load.
[07:49:24] <cmonster> is there a way to get the script to execute properly after the php page is loaded into parent page?
[07:49:45] <Kambfhase> ries: afaik, yes it is possible to create custom events or namespace existing ones. Never done it though :o
[07:50:13] <pachet> cmonster: that script should be evaluated automatically when you inject
[07:50:26] <ries> Kambfhase: may be it's called 'trigger', I was looking for 'sendEvent'
[07:50:35] <cmonster> Ok. So it should automatically fire.
[07:50:54] <cmonster> I got a serviceboard-iframe-stretchy.js:10Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'clientWidth' of null from the script
[07:52:13] <ciss> Kambfhase: sadly, no
[07:52:22] <cmonster> so for whatever reason, it cant evaluate the clientwidth propety. Why would that be ?
[07:53:05] <pachet> what's the object you're trying to find the property of?
[07:53:21] <Kambfhase> ciss: so the last idea i have is instead of using extend use Object.create()
[07:53:33] <cmonster> the object? what you mean in this case?
[07:53:48] <iJack2Madonna> Why doesn't JQuery like me fucking with setters/getters on the Object prototype?
[07:53:50] <Kambfhase> dont forgat to include crcks shim!
[07:54:29] <pachet> var foo=document.getElementById("bar"); alert(foo.clientWidth);
[07:54:37] <Kambfhase> iJack2Madonna: you should be ok as long as you make them enumerable: false.
[07:55:42] <cmonster> pachet, http://pastie.org/2508830
[07:56:53] <foldedcat> I am trying to wrap every "xr" on the page in sup tags, except for ones in the href. I'm running a simple replace for p, span, h1... but it is adding the <sup> tags in the hrefs making the links broken
[07:56:57] <foldedcat> Any advice?
[08:01:30] <riseman_> hai
[08:01:32] <riseman_> i mean hi
[08:01:33] <riseman_> lol
[08:01:35] <Kambfhase> foldedcat: i think xpath might be more suitable to find the `xr` you need instead of CSS
[08:01:53] <pachet> cmonster: looks like a scoping issue, works for me if i remove parent. from parent.document
[08:02:07] <riseman_> Where can I read about chaining stuff like animate? I
[08:02:19] <Kambfhase> ?animate @ riseman_
[08:02:20] <bot-t> riseman_, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[08:02:33] <cmonster> unfortunately, I don't control that js. That's just an embed they offer
[08:03:01] <riseman_> Kambfhase: I was just reading that :) What I couldn't find out it how to animate an element right after the previous animation has ended
[08:03:13] <Kambfhase> callback
[08:03:22] <foldedcat> kambfhase: I'll check it out, thanks!
[08:03:55] <riseman_> Kambfhase: should I do stuff where it says [complete] ?
[08:04:08] <Kambfhase> complete: A function to call once the animation is complete.
[08:04:16] <Kambfhase> yeah
[08:04:36] <riseman_> awesome
[08:05:02] <djQuery> wth? $('#accordion').accordion({changestart:Â function(){Â returnÂ false;Â }});
[08:05:20] <djQuery> still able to switch accordion pannels.
[08:05:34] <riseman_> Kambfhase: like this? $('#menu').animate({ top: '-490' } , 200 , $('.nav-trigger').animate({ left: '-280' }); );
[08:05:40] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/JGcjy/

[08:06:16] <riseman_> Kambfhase: great, thanks :)
[08:06:19] <mistik1> Hey guys, I have a page with multiple forms how do I select a specific form?
[08:06:28] <pachet> riseman: $('.foo').animate({height:100},300,function({alert:die;});
[08:06:52] <djQuery> mistik1: give the forms ids or unique names
[08:06:56] <mistik1> I'm trying $('form[name=foo]')
[08:07:03] <riseman_> pachet: I see, so I should turn $('.nav-trigger').animate({ left: '-280' }); to a function and call it there
[08:07:03] <mistik1> Does not work
[08:07:23] <riseman_> oooh, just forget what I said, now i get it :)
[08:07:27] <djQuery> mistik1: $('form[name="foo"]')
[08:07:32] <Kambfhase> riseman_: http://jsfiddle.net/QNMTq/
[08:07:41] <mistik1> ok
[08:08:03] <Kambfhase> pachet: syntax error ;)
[08:08:07] <riseman_> Kambfhase: thx!
[08:08:43] <djQuery> So is there no way to disable a panel in an accordion?
[08:08:47] <pachet> Kambfhase: eh.. he gets the picture
[08:08:59] <pachet> basically animate just accepts a callback function as a parameter
[08:10:06] <mistik1> djQuery: Thanks that worked, Is that explained in the docs why the quoting is needed for the form and not other selectors, or is that just experience on your part
[08:11:10] <fakingfantastic> Is there a way to have BBQ just push states as /#my/path ... and not /#some_key=my/path ... i don't need multi-states
[08:11:18] <mistik1> ie : $("input:checked[name=chkSelected]") <- this works
[08:11:25] <riseman_> Kambfhase: Any idea why both animations are happening at the same time?
[08:13:09] <djQuery> mistik1: dunno I always do it that way.
[08:13:10] <riseman_> Kambfhase: my mistake, had some old code doing stuff in there too
[08:13:17] <Kambfhase> :)
[08:13:20] <djQuery> and it always works
[08:18:45] <stan_man_can> Whe i'm updating page content with jquery
[08:19:10] <stan_man_can> $("#content").html("<h2>Hi</h2>");
[08:19:20] <stan_man_can> it's not applying my stylesheet to the new content
[08:19:22] <stan_man_can> any tips?
[08:19:53] <aavikkojootti> how do you apply stylesheet to content generally?
[08:20:27] <aavikkojootti> stan_man_can: please paste example code to jsfiddle
[08:20:39] <stan_man_can> aavikkojootti: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />
[08:21:42] <wreel> q: i have some rows of divs. if you click the button associated with one, it moves it to the bottom of the list using div.insertBefore('#output_end') where output_end is a div for this purpose. this works, but i'd like to add a little subtle animation. slideDown() doesn't seem to be doing the trick. is this the wrong function or am i doing it wrong?
[08:21:52] <djQuery> Is there no way to disable a ui.accordion panel?  http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/JGcjy/
[08:22:18] <stan_man_can> aavikkojootti: not sure how to make it apply to stuff added via js though
[08:22:25] <gar_onn> whyat is the best way to call a function at midnight?
[08:22:44] <gar_onn> *what
[08:23:10] <Kambfhase> gar_onn: use a cron job?
[08:23:40] <gar_onn> in javascript
[08:23:49] <djQuery> wreel: do the slideDown then once the animation finishes do the move.   var x = $(this).closest('div').slideDown(function(x.insertBefore('.selector'));
[08:23:53] <wreel> gar_onn: you can use the Date object to make that happen
[08:24:14] <gar_onn> yes, but should I just setTimeout till it is midnight
[08:24:29] <ries> Kambfhase: trigger works perfectly on document
[08:24:32] <gar_onn> (page is only loaded once a day)
[08:24:38] <Kambfhase> ries: :)
[08:24:48] <djQuery> gar_onn: use a cron script that opens a browser that executes the javascript at midnight
[08:24:49] <wreel> oh. cronjob then
[08:25:00] <janthony> I'm mainly a PHP developer, and still struggle with arrays/objects in JavaScript, data: { 'action': 'my_plugin_admin', 'method': 'load_meta_box', 'search': search }, - How would I convert this key value pair into one array stored as a var so I would do data: myArray. Typically in php I would do $myArray = array('key1' => 'value1', 'key2' => 'value2') or $myArray['key1'] = value1; $myArray['key2'] = value2
[08:25:14] <wreel> djQuery: interesting, so you think my move was interrupting the animation. let me try that, thanks!
[08:25:26] <gar_onn> djQuery,  how do I do that ?
[08:25:54] <erichynds> janthony: var obj = { foo: "bar" };  data: obj;
[08:26:16] <janthony> ahh, so it's actually an object, not an array
[08:26:28] <erichynds> yeah
[08:26:55] <djQuery> wreel: yes if you were chaining them like   .slideDown().insertBefore()  then the insert before would happen before the slideDown finished
[08:26:56] <janthony> erichynds: Thanks, if I already have an object built, do I just do push to add more values to it after it's built?
[08:27:07] <janthony> erichynds: er, more pairs
[08:27:50] <erichynds> janthony: you would do var obj = {}; obj.key = "foo";
[08:27:53] <Kambfhase> obj['new Key'] = 'new Value';
[08:27:54] <erichynds> or using bracket notation
[08:28:18] <janthony> Got it. So the bracket notation is identical to PHP it looks like.
[08:29:02] <stan_man_can> $("#div").html("<h2>Hello World</h2>"); inserts the H2 properly, but it holds the default style rather than the one i defined in the stylesheet i linked to
[08:30:53] <wreel> djQuery: is slideDown() the right function for animating re-ordering divs, though? even if i don't call the insertBefore(), i still see no animation

[08:33:54] <stan_man_can> any easy way to highlight certain text on a page? if I want to highlight all instances of "xyx" with yellow or osmething
[08:35:30] <wreel> stan_man_can: can you put a span around those so you can add a css class?

[08:41:30] <foldedcat> How do I escape html tags in jquery? I'm using replace to add <sup> tags on some text, but it's using the entities instead of the actual <
[08:41:31] <foldedcat> http://jsbin.com/iyusev
[08:42:08] <Kambfhase> foldedcat: use .html() instead of .text()
[08:42:36] <foldedcat> kambfhase: well, that was causing my hrefs to change
[08:43:00] <foldedcat> kambfhase: which was my original problem, so I was hoping text would fix that
[08:46:18] <Kambfhase> foldedcat: did you try xpath?
[08:46:44] <StevePerk> How can you add an "onClick" event to all buttons which have the value "Edit" or "Update"?  I'm trying something like:  $(':button[value=Edit]').click(function(e)...     but I'm not sure if that's on the right track, or how to make it select both "Edit" AND "Update"
[08:47:11] <alabd> erichynds: thanks
[08:47:27] <foldedcat> kambfhase: yeah, I was using $('a[href*="<sup>xr</sup>"]').addClass(yourClass); to look for any sup tags in the href, and just add a class to see if it was working
[08:47:31] <alabd> pachet: what do you mean by  depending on how you define works
[08:48:04] <nail_> StevePerk: that's it, just separate them with a comma ':button[value=Edit], :button[value=Update]'
[08:48:23] <pachet> oh i was just being snippy
[08:48:49] <pachet> cross browser issues are inevitable ;o
[08:49:10] <StevePerk> Huh.  Thanks!

[08:49:50] <freeed> hey all.. how can I load jquery and a jquery plugin in my website footer and be able to call/use them from code in my header? I'm using the .ready() method but still getting $("#hc_calendar").fullCalendar is not a function  in my console... if I move jquery and the plugin above the .ready() call it works.
[08:50:06] <foldedcat> kambfhase: ahhh any direction? All I know about xpath was from what I could google
[08:50:34] <Kambfhase> i am trying to come up with something, just gimme a few minutes.
[08:50:46] <foldedcat> kambfhase: thanks so much for your help

[09:09:12] <kiu1> Hi guys i have a question
[09:09:16] <aaronmcadam> it switches between em
[09:09:30] <aaronmcadam> you need a space on the left for the operator to work
[09:09:38] <aaronmcadam> or no other symbol
[09:09:43] <kiu1> this is pure discussion i don't want to resolve now the problem but try to understand better
[09:09:51] <aaronmcadam> otherwise how would it know to add it or convert to number xec
[09:10:01] <kiu1> i have made a game html5canvas+js
[09:10:21] <kiu1> at the end of the game i need to send the score
[09:10:52] <aaronmcadam> print it out and mail it?
[09:10:54] <aaronmcadam> :D
[09:10:57] <Klacsap> Im trying now for over 6 hours to solve this problem. i googled tons of sites and i cant find a solution. All wokrs fine in Firefox and Opera but not in IE,Chrome and Safari. In Chrome i get error: "SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL {arguments=[1], ...}  and parsererror". Anyone knows why?
[09:11:15] <kiu1> as you know i can't send the score with ajax
[09:11:26] <aaronmcadam> yeah cuz we've all seen your code and know exactly what the problem is Klacsap
[09:11:27] <Kambfhase> ?p @ Klacsap
[09:11:27] <bot-t> Klacsap, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:11:36] <kiu1> i mean, i can... but any user could send a fake score
[09:11:42] <kiu1> do you follow me?
[09:11:44] <Klacsap> sorry i did it. forgot the link http://jsfiddle.net/YpL5Y/ :)
[09:11:45] <aaronmcadam> they could?
[09:12:20] <aaronmcadam> depends on how ur setting it
[09:12:32] <kiu1> if i send the score with ajax means either that even the user calling the same function could send whatever score he wants
[09:12:33] <aaronmcadam> if you're posting the score
[09:12:44] <kiu1> Yes, i post the score
[09:12:55] <kiu1> for example
[09:12:56] <aaronmcadam> it's harder to manip that than a get
[09:13:05] <aaronmcadam> what user?
[09:13:19] <aaronmcadam> why would the user be calling a function?
[09:13:32] <aaronmcadam> are your users all js devs?
[09:13:39] <kiu1> $.ajax{(type:'post', url: THEURL, data:score=100, success:function(html){alert('ok');}});
[09:13:56] <kiu1> no they're not, maybe one on a thousand
[09:14:07] <aaronmcadam> they can't change your code
[09:14:31] <kiu1> i can call every function i want
[09:14:32] <aaronmcadam> i don't know why anyone would bother their arse tryin to cheat in firebug
[09:14:52] <Klacsap> Kampfhase: do you have an idea?
[09:14:52] <kiu1> ok i know there are even a few checks
[09:15:15] <kiu1> if the game isn't initialized pinging the server it will not accept any score
[09:15:17] <aaronmcadam> why don't u tag em with a special id you generate from the server or somethin
[09:15:24] <aaronmcadam> exactly
[09:15:36] <aaronmcadam> or if there's no session
[09:15:38] <Kambfhase> Klacsap: Mitmachen!
[09:15:57] <Klacsap> Was mitmachen?
[09:15:57] <kiu1> since the time is counted server side i don't allow MAXPOINTS > MAXPOINTSINTIME(x)
[09:16:30] <kiu1> but i would something more
[09:16:35] <aaronmcadam> u should do it with a token
[09:16:38] <aaronmcadam> a csrf token
[09:16:39] <kiu1> ok
[09:16:41] <aaronmcadam> like django does
[09:17:01] <aaronmcadam> generated for that user's browser session
[09:17:34] <Kambfhase> foldedcat: http://jsbin.com/iyusev/edit#source
[09:17:38] <aaronmcadam> so u add the token as a hidden field kiul
[09:17:49] <aaronmcadam> and then the server will know that the request came from the actual form
[09:17:52] <Kambfhase> foldedcat: sorry, forgot to save: http://jsbin.com/iyusev/2/edit
[09:18:07] <kiu1> ok, but like i send the score in the end (even if it's encrypted) couldn't do the same with firebug ?
[09:19:01] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[09:19:17] <aaronmcadam> it's an interestin question this
[09:19:48] <aaronmcadam> i know your example is trivial enough, it's a game, but what if u were sending customer data by ajax
[09:20:10] <aaronmcadam> any input guys?
[09:20:14] <Unckmania> I'm using the tablesorter.js plugin. I want to exclude a column from being sorted as i sort or unsort the other columns. Can i get any help here?
[09:20:24] <kiu1> i like, for more security your idea (csrf token) i will implement that... But i think that in the end using javascript the user will always has a method to send the "fake" score
[09:20:53] <aaronmcadam> there must be a way tho, as i said, what about more sensitive data
[09:21:15] <aaronmcadam> like say a payment, somebody could use firebug if they just monitored your POSTs
[09:21:26] <kiu1> Yes...
[09:21:31] <kiu1> javascript + payment
[09:21:47] <kiu1> i do that only with the encrypted paypal button
[09:22:00] <aaronmcadam> check the django docs, they send a CSRF header too
[09:22:26] <aaronmcadam> i *think* that might be the way they fix the problem
[09:22:35] <Kambfhase> Klacsap: well, your code doesn't replicate the error you described
[09:22:45] <kiu1> but is the inverse.. with paypal i require to the server the enc button... with this (ie. this game) i send to server... i'll try to read django docs of course
[09:22:49] <Connorhd> csrf doesn't prevent someone modifying their own submissions
[09:22:58] <Kambfhase> Klacsap: please paste an example of your JSON.
[09:23:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah any idea around it, maybe encrypt your post data?
[09:23:21] <kiu1> yes i could encrypt it
[09:23:33] <Klacsap> Kambfhase: im getting this Response in chrome as well: {"success":"no","errormessage":"Bitte geben Sie richtige Daten an!"}
[09:23:41] <Connorhd> encrypt how? if its client side the user can see how you do it
[09:23:50] <aaronmcadam> true
[09:24:02] <kiu1> but since we're always talking about js the user would access to the encrypt function
[09:24:16] <Connorhd> if the game has a specific state at that score you could hash the state somehow
[09:24:25] <Connorhd> its a hard problem though
[09:24:42] <aaronmcadam> somebody must have a few techniques for it tho
[09:24:42] <Unckmania> I'm using the tablesorter.js plugin. I want to exclude a column from being sorted as i sort or unsort the other columns. Can i get any help here?
[09:25:13] <kiu1> i thought to some type of source code encryption
[09:25:36] <Connorhd> hard to obduscate js and even harder to obfuscate the request
[09:25:39] <aaronmcadam> ah maybe obfuscation?
[09:25:47] <kiu1> but it will be always reversable...
[09:25:49] <aaronmcadam> seems like overkill tho
[09:26:01] <kiu1> like packer of dean
[09:26:03] <aaronmcadam> there must be a solution
[09:26:04] <kiu1> reversable
[09:26:27] <kiu1> i may create a new packer function not reversable with tools on the web
[09:26:48] <Connorhd> but you have to provide the function
[09:26:49] <aaronmcadam> maybe the short answer is to just do a normal submit for these things
[09:26:53] <kiu1> but i bet that i could find the function to send the score anyway
[09:27:26] <kiu1> yes.. But normal submit of a value contained in a js variable..editable just before sending
[09:27:28] <kiu1> :(
[09:27:31] <aaronmcadam> then again, anyone could manip the html too
[09:27:37] <kiu1> hehe
[09:27:42] <kiu1> it's recursive :D
[09:27:47] <Connorhd> depends on the game, a hash of state or checkpoints or similar could work
[09:27:54] <kiu1> yeah
[09:27:54] <aaronmcadam> ah yes
[09:28:01] <kiu1> i already have checkpointws
[09:28:02] <aaronmcadam> if state != finished
[09:28:10] <Connorhd> ie the only way to get the hash is to play the game to that point
[09:28:15] <aaronmcadam> yep
[09:28:42] <Connorhd> not trivial to code or a generic solution though :(
[09:28:47] <kiu1> play the game to that point means reach a point when a var gameEnded is equal to True ?
[09:29:14] <aaronmcadam> or maybe hash each stage with an ajax request and then continue if verified from the server, i dunno
[09:29:14] <kiu1> Was more simple hack the r0ket @ CCC 2011
[09:29:42] <tfitts> yeah, you need unique hashes for each user/stage
[09:29:57] <tfitts> otherwise they get a hash from one game or stage and use it later
[09:30:07] <kiu1> got it
[09:30:26] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[09:30:27] <kiu1> i may use a system like verisign tokens
[09:30:40] <aaronmcadam> and only submit the actual score if each checkpoint token exist
[09:30:59] <kiu1> Yeah.. uhm.. a token every X seconds
[09:31:18] <aaronmcadam> or store the tokens in the session?
[09:31:36] <kiu1> X > y <- server side could hang a little .. since the request is made in ajax
[09:31:44] <kiu1> or better
[09:31:56] <kiu1> reverse ajax
[09:32:05] <kiu1> as like as Ajax Push Engine
[09:32:06] <aaronmcadam> hmm could you use the session tho?
[09:32:19] <Ogredude> quick question...  Can you $(document).ready multiple times?  I've got several different things going on, and if I can clean things up by putting them each in their own $(document).ready handler that'd be great
[09:32:20] <tfitts> the only thing with sending one every x seconds is you have to send game data to generate the token, and the more game data they're sending to get tokens the better your token generation needs to be.
[09:32:39] <xec> Ogredude: nothing wrong with that afaik
[09:32:47] <aaronmcadam> no but you should refactor
[09:32:59] <tfitts> I always wonder why people don't just try things out like that for themselves.
[09:33:07] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[09:33:09] <smolly> What is this nagivation effect named? http://martenvandijl.com/
[09:33:33] <Ogredude> xec:  excellent, thanks
[09:33:50] <xec> smolly: "fade"? :D
[09:34:01] <Ogredude> tfitts:  mostly because I'm not familiar enough with javascript to come up with simple things to ensure it works
[09:34:15] <aaronmcadam> i'd call it "useless"
[09:34:44] <xec> or maybe "annoying"
[09:34:46] <smolly> xec: Nice, I thought that too. Is there any ready to use script so I can get that effect on my navigation easy
[09:35:00] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't add anything
[09:35:12] <aaronmcadam> fade ins like that are annoying for ux
[09:35:22] <aaronmcadam> u might think it "looks cool"
[09:35:25] <aaronmcadam> but it's a waste of time
[09:35:30] <tfitts> it's like flash intros
[09:35:31] <tfitts> F em
[09:35:34] <angelsanchezjr> hi, just aquestion, is there a way to access here with mirc32?
[09:35:34] <kiu1> So we put together few ideas... In these days i'll try something... I think that some server validation will help
[09:35:52] <aaronmcadam> kiu1: yeah, could u use server sessions to help?
[09:36:36] <kiu1> yes i could..
[09:36:38] <Ogredude> angelsanchezjr:  yeah, just connect to irc.freenode.net
[09:36:51] <angelsanchezjr> tnx very much
[09:37:12] <aaronmcadam> kiu1: could u use X-REQUESTED-WITH to help?
[09:37:19] <aaronmcadam> and Referrer headers?
[09:37:29] <enjalot> can i use .css to access css class rules without attaching to an html element?
[09:37:32] <xec> i love how it's still called mirc32, like the 16 bit version is still the normal one
[09:37:53] <aaronmcadam> that won't work enjalot,
[09:38:09] <enjalot> aaronmcadam: is there an easy way to manipulate/view css classes with jquery?
[09:38:15] <angelsanchezjr> xec, i know, i loce olÂ´stuff too
[09:38:26] <aaronmcadam> ?addClass @ enjalot
[09:38:27] <bot-t> enjalot, .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[09:38:27] <angelsanchezjr> i mean i love
[09:38:34] <kiu1> Referrer.... i have to try calling a function from firebug and from the html page and look at the headers
[09:38:43] <enjalot> thanks
[09:38:44] <aaronmcadam> ?attr @ enjalot
[09:38:45] <bot-t> enjalot, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[09:38:58] <aaronmcadam> or just el[0].classNAme enjalot
[09:39:01] <kiu1> if are different it's awesome!
[09:39:08] <aaronmcadam> .className I mean
[09:39:21] <aaronmcadam> yes kiu1
[09:39:24] <aaronmcadam> that should work
[09:39:38] <aaronmcadam> also, a firebug request shouldn't be an xhr
[09:39:48] <aaronmcadam> so you can check the x-requested-with header too
[09:39:58] <kiu1> yes, of course
[09:40:22] <aaronmcadam> and also in ur view make sure that the request was made by post just be sure too
[09:40:52] <error1f1f> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7195901/how-to-prevent-blurring-on-autocomplete-selection
[09:40:53] <kiu1> and i think that will be very difficult fake the score... and no one will try
[09:41:06] <error1f1f> was hoping somebody might be able to find a solution
[09:41:18] <error1f1f> help me^^
[09:41:33] <fakingfantastic> Does BBQ offer a way to retrieve the current hash?
[09:41:49] <aaronmcadam> read the docs
[09:42:12] <kiu1> i think that i will work on these solutions in the week-end
[09:42:20] <aaronmcadam> cool dude
[09:42:23] <aaronmcadam> hope u sort it
[09:42:55] <error1f1f> i am  just thinking that the blur event should not be raised on autocomplete selection since the text box techincally doesnt not lose focus
[09:42:58] <kiu1> i hope so :) is a fuckin' game but is the security systems behind that what i care :D
[09:42:59] <fakingfantastic> error1f1f: we do this very same type of hi-jacking with Collabable; look into overriding .bind("autocompleteselect", function(e, ui) {
[09:43:08] <fakingfantastic> or any of those
[09:44:05] <kiu1> i'll keep in touch in case of some discoveries :-] hehe i'm here almost all days.. [working] hehe
[09:44:22] <angelsanchez> hi
[09:44:25] <angelsanchez> back again
[09:44:38] <Kambfhase> ZOMG he is back, hide everyone!
[09:45:56] <error1f1f> fakingfantastic: would the event be bound to the input box or the autocomplete itself?
[09:46:07] <fakingfantastic> autocomplete
[09:46:12] <fakingfantastic> it's not an "Input" box
[09:46:48] <fakingfantastic> The Input is the Autocomplete, that's the abstraction UI gives you ... and as such you have to play by its rules (and use the bind stuff)
[09:48:55] <pom_> Can I add an event to an element and trigger that event later?
[09:49:13] <pom_> $('#mybutton').addEvent('reload', function()...
[09:49:25] <pom_> Then later $('#mybutton').reload();
[09:49:41] <aaronmcadam> there's no quick way to convert the string 'true' to a boolean true is there?
[09:49:50] <aaronmcadam> ?eval 'false'
[09:49:51] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: "false"
[09:49:55] <aaronmcadam> ?eval 'true'
[09:49:55] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: "true"
[09:49:58] <aaronmcadam> wtf?
[09:50:04] <aaronmcadam> that shouldn't be right
[09:50:19] <pom_> aaronmcadam: bool = string == 'true' ? true : false;
[09:50:30] <aaronmcadam> well yeah
[09:50:48] <aaronmcadam> ah duh
[09:50:53] <aaronmcadam> ?eval !!"false"
[09:50:54] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: true
[09:51:21] <aaronmcadam> hmm probably the easiest way
[09:53:14] <dabear> ?eval !!"true"
[09:53:15] <bot-t> dabear: true
[09:53:28] <dabear> aaronmcadam: nope
[09:53:33] <xec> don't really need the ternary though? bool = string == 'true'; would suffice?
[09:53:52] <dabear> xec: correct
[09:54:38] <dabear> pom_: .trigger("reload")
[09:55:08] <pom_> dabear: How do I attach the event=
[09:55:08] <pom_> ?
[09:55:32] <dabear> ?bind @ pom_
[09:55:33] <bot-t> pom_, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[09:55:52] <pom_> bot-t: Can I use a custom eventType?
[09:55:53] <bot-t> pom_, Concentrate and ask again.
[09:55:58] <dabear> you can
[09:56:12] <dabear> ?bot @ pom_
[09:56:13] <bot-t> pom_, sentient but living in the machine locale.
[09:56:54] <pachet> sentient as a pile of rocks
[09:57:19] <xec> i'm having regex trouble, anyone care to have a look? http://jsfiddle.net/FvxSS/
[10:00:43] <xec> http://jsfiddle.net/FvxSS/1/ <-- am i crazy?
[10:01:29] <dabear> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/FvxSS/2/
[10:02:01] <dabear> my guess is that those prefixes are consideres special somehow
[10:02:07] <dabear> so you need to escape them
[10:02:13] <xec> of course
[10:02:53] <dabear> ah, yes
[10:02:55] <peol> When using the RegExp constructor, you need to double your escapes in the pattern
[10:03:13] <xec> yeah, it makes sense, thanks a lot
[10:04:23] <dabear> peol: isnt there some escapeRegexpInput function available somewhere? :p
[10:04:53] <peol> dabear: probably somewhere on the web, but not natively :p
[10:05:16] <xec> everything is on the internets. trust me, i've been there
[10:05:29] * dabear just escaped peol's mom
[10:05:34] <peol> watch it
[10:05:42] <phlp> could also put + in [ ] .. or even put them all in there and use one regex
[10:05:46] <dabear> she had me in her dungeon :(
[10:05:51] <peol> btw, did you meet up with karbassi? he's in oslo now dabear
[10:05:58] <peol> i think, he's somewhere in norway anyway
[10:06:06] <dabear> peol: nope
[10:07:27] <tfitts> anyone here ever used jCarousel?
[10:08:25] <xec> phlp: you're a genious! http://jsfiddle.net/FvxSS/3/
[10:09:00] <dabear> peol: is this his sister or gf? http://www.flickr.com/photos/karbassi/5342307444/
[10:09:02] <dabear> hawt
[10:09:52] <sphinxxx> whats the most efficient way to search for an array of div's with a certain class
[10:10:00] <sphinxxx> and then reference an individual one out of the array
[10:10:07] <peol> dabear: her name seems to be Cristina Peterson, probably not sister
[10:10:16] <dabear> div.foo
[10:10:18] <xec> i'm going to guess *not sister* http://www.flickr.com/photos/karbassi/5342327134/in/photostream/
[10:10:26] <dabear> ?eq @ sphinxxx
[10:10:26] <bot-t> sphinxxx, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[10:10:38] <erichynds> sphinxxx: $(arrayOfDivs).filter(".class")
[10:10:52] <erichynds> or find() depending on ur dom structure
[10:11:00] <error1f1f> hmm it still seems to ignore my autocomplete select bind
[10:12:10] <sphinxxx> ah, thanks so much
[10:12:48] <sphinxxx> so this would grab the first element of class "class"  $(this).find('.class').eq(0);
[10:13:11] <dabear> tru dat
[10:15:29] <xarxer> Is there any function (or external library) for making an image brighter in jQuery?
[10:17:49] <pachet> er
[10:17:55] <sean`> xarxer, you should look at canvas
[10:18:33] <xarxer> sean`: Will do
[10:19:35] <foldedcat> kambfhase: hey I'm sorry I had to step away from my computer for a moment, did you have a chance to look at my script?
[10:19:54] <Kambfhase> foldedcat: yeah, did paste a url
[10:20:29] <Kambfhase> foldedcat: http://jsbin.com/iyusev/2/edit#preview
[10:20:53] <foldedcat> kambfhase: thank you so much
[10:21:04] <foldedcat> kambfhase: looks good, I'm checking it out now
[10:21:17] <sphinxxx> are there any known bugs with parseInt ?
[10:21:27] <sphinxxx> i just got "0" when parseing "08"
[10:21:32] <sphinxxx> instead of 8
[10:22:37] <Kambfhase> thats a feature ;)
[10:22:59] <foldedcat> kambfhase: so what basically is happening in the first two lines of this, if you don't mind
[10:23:00] <dabear> ?eval parseInt("08")
[10:23:01] <bot-t> dabear: 0
[10:23:03] <sean`> yay for Kamakazi
[10:23:04] <dabear> ?eval parseInt("08", 10)
[10:23:05] <bot-t> dabear: 8
[10:23:24] <dabear> base ten :)
[10:23:33] <sphinxxx> ah
[10:23:47] <bleen> I have a textarea that is mysteriously going blank when my form is submitted â€¦ what is the best way to figure out what js is changing the value of that textarea?  I tried attaching an onchange handler to teh textarea but apparently its not triggered by script-based changes â€¦ ideas?
[10:23:56] <sphinxxx> never wouldve figured that out, thx
[10:25:20] <dabear> bleen: use a dom attribute change  breakpoint in chrome
[10:26:06] <bleen> dabear: hmmm â€¦ never heard of that â€¦. Ill take a look
[10:26:14] <Kambfhase> foldedcat: ok, this is a pure-jquery version: http://jsbin.com/iyusev/3/edit#preview
[10:26:45] <Kambfhase> both codes do the exact same thing. but the furst one uses XPath and is faster.
[10:27:11] <Kambfhase> the jQ version is more extensible though.
[10:27:16] <dabear> bleen: inspect the element, right click and choose "break on attributes modifications"
[10:27:58] <Kambfhase> foldedcat: brb
[10:28:06] <xec> okay guys, i think i've got my regex sort of working, but it looks a bit iffy to me, any ideas on how i could reduce this code to only one regex? http://jsfiddle.net/FvxSS/4/
[10:28:19] <foldedcat> kambfhase: awesome, thank you!
[10:28:26] <sean`> xec, .*
[10:29:45] <sean`> xec, /\n+[@#]/
[10:30:02] <sean`> Btw, spaces aren't \n, those are newlines
[10:30:14] <xec> yes, it is newlines i'm looking for
[10:30:28] * muzone is now playing: http://home.no/mritz/buried2.mp3
[10:30:58] <flint0131> lol
[10:32:09] <phlp> xec the second regex (.+) will work for both cases
[10:32:18] <sean`> xec, check mine
[10:32:20] <sean`> plz
[10:32:26] <sean`> pwettyplz
[10:33:02] <xec> + means 0 or more and * means 1 or more?
[10:33:09] <bleen> dabear: thats pretty cool .. but it doesnt seem to fire when contents of the <textarea>â€¦THISâ€¦</textarea> changes
[10:33:13] <xec> i'm rusty
[10:33:27] <sean`> xec, * maens 0 or more
[10:33:33] <sean`> + means 1 or more
[10:33:36] <sean`> at least one
[10:33:38] <bleen> dabear: I'll try "subtree" breakpoint â€¦ perhaps that will help
[10:34:13] <phlp> prefix with nothing after it wouldnt be much of a tag
[10:34:13] <xec> right, i would like to always have text after the tag prefix so i guess + is better

[10:41:30] <bleen> sshaginyan: I meant that for smplstk
[10:41:35] <flint0131> Guys, how can I change the location of the address bar when i click a link without refreshing the page?

[10:44:11] <smplstk> bleen: it doesn't work because .change() isn't triggered.
[10:44:22] <bleen> smplstk: thats my problem
[10:44:24] <smplstk> but you can call change() if you wanted to
[10:44:24] <Kambfhase> ?eval /([@+#])/.exec("@tag")[1]
[10:44:25] <bot-t> Kambfhase: "@"
[10:44:31] <smplstk> $('textarea').val('foo').change();
[10:44:45] <bleen> smplstk: I want to find out what script is changing my textarea
[10:44:48] <smplstk> bleen: it's more for user input.
[10:44:49] <Kambfhase> sshaginyan: wrap it in $( )
[10:44:51] <flint0131> Any alternative for hashchanged event without using hash? :/
[10:44:59] <bleen> smplstk: so calling "change" doesnt help me

[10:45:18] <TeddyMurray> hi i have a complicated JSON i need to parse
[10:45:25] <TeddyMurray> im doing console.debug() and it gives me this:
[10:45:40] <sphinxxx> how can i grab an element that's outside of the <html> tags
[10:45:48] <sphinxxx> i tried using filter, but its return a null array
[10:45:58] <TeddyMurray> crap, can't copy from the console..
[10:46:07] <sshaginyan> Kambfhase: wrap what? Can you give me an example? You mean $('<a href=\'#\'>'+val+'</a>')?
[10:46:17] <Kambfhase> yeah,
[10:46:22] <Kambfhase> TIAS
[10:46:55] <Kambfhase> sphinxxx: outside of <html> is that even possible. And if it is, why?
[10:47:03] <TeddyMurray> yes flint0131 ?
[10:47:07] <sshaginyan> Kambfhase: That didn't work
[10:47:07] <bartek> Hi there. How does $.when().done work when I pass an Array of deferred objects into it? It seems to execute right away.
[10:47:44] <flint0131> TeddyMurray: Have you tried $.parseJSON()?
[10:48:00] <TeddyMurray> flint0131, yes im having trouble with accessing the right object
[10:48:03] <TeddyMurray> i can post the JSON
[10:48:35] <TeddyMurray> http://pastebin.com/XHTk8tT5
[10:48:45] <TeddyMurray> the 0's and 1's are throiwng me off
[10:48:46] <TeddyMurray> throwing*
[10:49:03] <TeddyMurray> for instance, how would i access the team_key?
[10:49:14] <TeddyMurray> after a parseJSON
[10:50:31] <sshaginyan> a'<a href=\'#\'>'+val+'</a>'
[10:50:44] <sshaginyan> When I try to print '<a href=\'#\'>'+val+'</a>' it actually gives me the string and not the link. Can someone please help me? http://pastie.org/2509556
[10:50:49] <error1f1f> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5711864/jquery-preventing-autocomplete-select-triggering-blur as well
[10:50:49] <jugstah> after I go back to page 1(from page 2), how do I tell it to check the values and reapply some of the things?
[10:51:19] <flint0131> Teddy Murray: A variable name cannot start with a numeral. For instance, 4oh4 would be illegal variable names.
[10:51:25] <jugstah> if selected = "ELOC" then apply this rule (its not a click event but going back to page 1 and checking the values)
[10:51:50] <Kambfhase> flint0131: when you quote a number it is a valid key.
[10:52:05] <TeddyMurray> hmm crap, that's how its being sent to me though
[10:52:19] <TeddyMurray> is there a way to make parseJSON for arrays instead of objects
[10:52:37] <phlp> TeddyMurray: fantasy_content.users["0"].user[1].teams["0"].team[0][0].team_key .. 99 problems
[10:52:53] <TeddyMurray> orly
[10:52:55] <TeddyMurray> *tests*
[10:53:09] <sphinxxx> Kambfhase, yes its outside <html> because php echos it
[10:53:21] <Kambfhase> fun fact: you could emit the "0" and just use 0;
[10:53:31] <jugstah> guess i wasnt clear, i'll try stackoverflow i guess

[10:53:57] <TeddyMurray> worked perfectly phlp, thanks for helping me debug flint0131
[10:54:06] <enjoycrf> hey guyzzzzz
[10:54:12] <enjoycrf> check this out
[10:54:22] <enjoycrf> i been using a hi def mouse
[10:54:24] <enjoycrf> u kno
[10:54:37] <enjoycrf> i have my old optical at work
[10:54:39] <jugstah> basically want to reapply some of the stuff after a page reloads
[10:54:48] <enjoycrf> and i think the optical mouse is actually way smoother
[10:54:58] <enjoycrf> did anyone else notice this?
[10:55:03] <Kambfhase> sphinxxx: just use $("selector") as usual. things will get moved into the <body> automatically
[10:55:19] <dcardine> when using the jQuery UI Dialog widget, do i need to explicitly set anything for the focusable/tabbable code to kick in?
[10:57:08] <denisesballs> hey all, would there be a way to change some data before it is sorted and displayed with tablesorter?
[10:58:30] <error1f1f> how would you get the selected value from an autocomplete?
[10:58:37] <foldedcat> kambfhase: any idea on how we can get all xr's on the page wrapped in <sup> instead of just ones in <a> tags?
[10:59:04] <Kambfhase> yes: replace the a by *
[10:59:18] <Kambfhase> WARNING: THAT'LL BE HORRIBLY SLOW
[10:59:33] <jugstah> which event will run event if a page reloads?
[10:59:57] <vivep> I want to have a map in my web page which will have markers based on the lat lon information which will be dynamically updated into the database in real time. Should i use Php or JQuery to implement the map?

[11:00:34] <sshaginyan> When I try to print '<a href=\'#\'>'+val+'</a>' it actually gives me the string and not the link. Can someone please help me? http://pastie.org/2509556
[11:00:49] <Postmodernist> Yo, men with the motherfunkin' plan!
[11:00:52] <Postmodernist> I'm a PHP pounder from down under and I have a big problem.
[11:00:54] <foldedcat> kambfhase: ah gotcha, thakns for the advice!
[11:01:02] <Postmodernist> How can I escape() a string in a way that's compatible with unescape() in JavaScript? For example, spaces are encoded as %20, not +.
[11:02:08] <dabear> Postmodernist: dont worry about it, serialize down to json and it handles all that for you
[11:02:21] <dabear> e.g. echo json_encode($arr)
[11:02:38] <nail_> Any "image transition" plugins that provide a bunch of effects to recommend? Like CrossSlide or ImageSwitch
[11:02:59] <Postmodernist> dabear: Schweet.
[11:04:57] <dcardine> when using the jQuery UI Dialog widget, do i need to explicitly set anything for the focusable/tabbable code to kick in? I need my first textbox w/ focus when the dialog opens, and i see that there's code that does that, but I can't find any info on how to make that code execute, and it doesn't seem to be doing it by default.
[11:08:54] <phlp> dcardine: dialog has an open event, focus the textbox there
[11:09:30] <sshaginyan> When I try to print '<a href=\'#\'>'+val+'</a>' it actually gives me the string and not the link. Can someone please help me? http://pastie.org/2509556
[11:10:01] * jugstah is away. Automatically set away [SZon]
[11:10:36] <dcardine> phlp: i originally began doing that, but then i stumbled on the jquery.ui code and thought it may already be doing something similar
[11:11:53] <sphinxxx> so how can i select an element that is outside of <html> ?
[11:12:02] <sphinxxx> its outside because php echos it
[11:12:43] <ghost1k> sphinxxx: you can select element that is the part of DOM tree only
[11:13:55] <Postmodernist> OH MY GOD JQUERY GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS DOWN UNDER!!!
[11:14:09] <sphinxxx> im not quite sure what to do then, because php echos a stirng $output, which contains an entire page <html> to </html>
[11:14:17] <sphinxxx> then afterwards echos <p>something</p>
[11:14:29] <kborchers> sphinxxx: change your php
[11:14:44] <dabear> sphinxxx: there cannot be any code after </html> in the DOM
[11:14:46] * Postmodernist managed to fuck with the Object prototype's __defineGetter__ and __defineSetter__ to make jquery go crazy.
[11:14:53] <dabear> if there is in the source, it will be moved
[11:15:08] <dabear> Postmodernist: nice
[11:15:12] <dabear> show me an example?
[11:15:14] <Postmodernist> dabear: Not true, webkit will automatically move the elements into body.
[11:15:21] <sphinxxx> is there a php function to do that?
[11:16:08] <dabear> Postmodernist: huh, that's what I said
[11:16:09] <ghost1k> sphinxxx: try to modify your php
[11:16:39] <ghost1k> sphinxxx: it is incorrect to output html outside of <html> tag
[11:16:45] <Postmodernist> dabear: Sure, let me paste it
[11:17:03] <flint0131> Someone's on a boat.
[11:17:28] <sphinxxx> hmm
[11:17:44] <sphinxxx> is this the best way to return information from php to the page containing the ajax request?
[11:17:51] <sphinxxx> i just put the info in a <p> tag
[11:18:33] <ghost1k> sphinxxx: sorry, cannot wrap my head around it
[11:18:54] <phlp> sshaginyan: have you tried putting the link in label: instead of value: ?
[11:18:55] <Postmodernist> dabear: Check it out: https://gist.github.com/1206939 (How to make jQuery cry!)
[11:19:35] <sshaginyan> phlp: nope let me try
[11:19:40] <Postmodernist> jQuery *HATES* toying with Object.prototype.__defineGetter__
[11:19:48] <dabear> Postmodernist: more interested in what happens with jquery when you do that..
[11:20:25] <sshaginyan> phlp: So you mean label: $('<')
[11:20:44] <sshaginyan> member:phlp: So you mean label: $('<u>'+val'</u>')?
[11:21:16] <phlp> sshaginyan: just the string not $()
[11:21:34] <sshaginyan> phlp: Yes I have, I get the same result
[11:23:16] <Postmodernist> dabear: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'handler' of undefined jQuery.event.remove jQuery.extend.cleanData b.cleanData jQuery.fn.extend.empty jQuery.fn.extend.html
[11:23:22] <Postmodernist> gOOD FUN.
[11:23:52] <Postmodernist> Basically, jQuery gets fucked and throws a bunch of TypeErrors.
[11:23:55] <sshaginyan> phlp: Let me tell you my situation. I'm trying to load boxes with peoples information within them (pic, phone, links, etc...) I really don't like the structure ul, li that autocomplete gives me. Is there anyway I can make them into divs and spans?
[11:25:36] <sshaginyan> phlp: or is there anyway I can remove the anchor tag within "li" without modifying the jquery-ui core files?
[11:26:54] <Spadeski>  sup sup
[11:26:59] <flint0131> sshaginyan: how 'bout a replace regexp?
[11:27:20] <dabear> Postmodernist: omg, you broek jquery, you broeke zeh intartubes!
[11:27:34] <flint0131> lol
[11:27:43] <Postmodernist> Now Madonna will kiss me.
[11:27:58] <sshaginyan> flint0131: Can you give me an example or explain it more clearly?
[11:28:01] <dabear> nah, but michael jackson will
[11:28:24] <sshaginyan> what do you mean replace regex?
[11:28:43] <sshaginyan> flint0131: Within the core files? within jquery? where?
[11:29:33] <dabear> text.replace(/someregex/, "bar")
[11:29:43] <Postmodernist> Madonna might even let me sex her.
[11:29:44] <phlp> sshaginyan: i still dont see the point. sounds like a lot of work for no gain. the point of a library is to save you some work why try and undo everything it does
[11:30:11] <sshaginyan> phlp: So your suggesting to create it from scratch?
[11:31:21] <flint0131> sshaginyan: Oh you're talking about jQuery UI, didn't know that. Forget what I said. Lol.
[11:31:33] <sshaginyan> flint0131: Yes
[11:32:38] <Postmodernist> flint0131: Flint, Michigan represent!
[11:33:20] <flint0131> Yaba Daba Doo represent!
[11:34:22] * Postmodernist got caught with Madonna records in his underwear by the CFO today ;(
[11:34:32] <sshaginyan> member:phlp: So your suggesting to create it from scratch?
[11:34:49] <sshaginyan> phlp: So your suggesting to create it from scratch?
[11:35:29] <phlp> i dont even know what "it" is
[11:35:36] <pachet> life
[11:36:17] <sshaginyan> phlp: "it" was explained at the top... Let me tell you my situation. I'm trying to load boxes with peoples information within them (pic, phone, links, etc...) I really don't like the structure ul, li that autocomplete gives me. Is there anyway I can make them into divs and spans?
[11:36:25] <flint0131> sshaginyan: you can use returnedString.replace(/<a /gi, '<span ').replace(/<\/a>/gi, '<\/span>');
[11:36:25] <max_ink> hi all looking for a little help with jquery end callback within the views slideshow jquery cycle feature. using drupal7. want to implement a redirect at the end of the slideshow, the jquery cycle custom options gives advance options "end" , but i am having no luck defining the value. tried <<  function () {window.location.replace("http://example.com");  >> any help, much appreciated.
[11:37:56] <garbagegod> how do i assign certain elemtns  as pagers with the cycle query
[11:38:04] <garbagegod> and have it automatically change them
[11:38:26] <flint0131> max_ink: window.self.location = 'your location';
[11:39:09] <flint0131> lol nvm
[11:43:12] <phlp> sshaginyan: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/custom-data.html
[11:44:19] <phlp> sshaginyan: look at the end of the js it replaces _renderItem for custom rendering
[11:44:57] <sshaginyan> phlp: Got it thank you soo much. Let me see what U=I can do
[11:45:01] <sshaginyan> I
[11:46:32] <necromancer> there needs to be a channel where people can paste code
[11:46:35] <necromancer> i suggest #dump
[11:48:30] <matt_sa> I have a .hover() function wherein the first hoverIn function has a setTimeout until it fires. Unfortunately, if the mouse leaves, the function in setTimeout still fires even though I'm no longer hovering
[11:48:56] <matt_sa> how can I check to see that the cursor is still on the current element?
[11:50:01] <kborchers> matt_sa: in your hoverIn, set var x = setTimeout(....); then in hoverOut clearTimeout(x);
[11:50:16] <matt_sa> kborchers: that's great - i'll try that.
[11:50:21] <kborchers> sorry, x will need to be scoped outside of hoverIn so that hoverOut know what it is
[11:50:44] <kborchers> matt_sa: ^^
[11:51:26] <matt_sa> kborchers: err - the setTimeout is defined within .hover({setTimeout(function() {â€¦}, 100), function() { clearTimeout() } );
[11:51:40] <matt_sa> so I'll have to define the setTimeout block outside of the .hover() block even though I don't want it to fire?
[11:52:50] <kborchers> no, you just define your var outside of hover then inside you set that var = your setTimeout inside hover
[11:53:41] <djQuery> matt_sa:     var timer;     $('.hoverelem').hover(function(){  timer = setTimeout(fucntion(){}); }, function(){ clearTimeout(timer); })
[11:54:01] <kborchers> exactly, thanks djQuery
[11:54:22] <danzik171> Not really jQuery related, but is there a Testswarm user/dev IRC channel or forum?  Couldn't find one and figured someone in here might know.  The google group seems dead.
[11:54:31] <djQuery> might be some messed up } and ) in there
[11:57:17] <matt_sa> djQuery: does timer fire when I set it's value to setTimeout? or do I have to make timer a function and then call it afterward?
[11:57:47] <djQuery> ? dont understand
[11:57:48] <bot-t> djQuery, :submit Selector - Selects all elements of type submit. http://api.jquery.com/submit-selector/
[11:58:16] <kborchers> matt_sa: it starts the timer as soon as you set it
[12:00:00] <matt_sa> djQuery & kborchers: ah - okay, got it to work. thanks so much for your guys' help!
[12:00:03] <matt_sa> great solution
[12:00:09] <kborchers> :)
[12:04:54] <sphinxxx> why doesn't this work, if h="#id"
[12:04:55] <sphinxxx> $(data).find(h)
[12:04:56] <djQuery> dang fiddle is acting up
[12:05:18] <djQuery> hit save 1 min ago and still waitin
[12:05:34] <sphinxxx> djQuery, it was acting up for me too
[12:05:44] <djQuery> matt_sa  http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/6jHZX/
[12:06:33] <djQuery> just love people that come in here ask a question get thier answer then leave before returning the favor for anyone else
[12:07:03] <pachet> what caliber of issue do you think those people could actually solve ;o
[12:07:19] <djQuery> pachet: gues ur right
[12:08:06] <djQuery> so there is no way to disable a ui.accordion
[12:08:08] <djQuery> ?
[12:08:13] <kanja1> I think I found a bug in jquery 1.6.3
[12:08:37] <kanja1> It looks like ff and webkit have some different behavor
[12:08:39] <snover> ?bug
[12:08:40] <bot-t> Think about it - Is it more likely that there's a bug in a library used by most of the internet, or that you made a mistake? http://is.gd/bVMO3
[12:08:43] <djQuery> kanja1: cool put together a demo and submit a but then
[12:08:55] <kanja1> when making a CORS script without specifying a datatype
[12:09:05] <kanja1> webkit will convert it to json, and ff keeps it as a string
[12:09:24] <kanja1> alright, I'll make sure it's reproducible
[12:11:55] <kborchers> kanja1: are you sure it's a bug? is the data being sent with a proper MIME type? If not, you can't blame jQuery.
[12:12:37] <kanja1> kborchers: in my case, yeah - response is being sent with "application/json"
[12:13:04] <kborchers> hmmm, intersting. i would be interested in seeing your test case
[12:13:28] <kanja1> it only showed up when I switched the domain the requests were going to - so when making a same domain request w/o a data type it worked perfectly, different domain and it broke
[12:13:44] <sphinxxx> djQuery, any reason why that code i pasted won't work?
[12:13:52] <sphinxxx> $(data).find(h);
[12:14:32] <djQuery> sphinxxx:   depends on what data is I gues
[12:15:01] <djQuery> sphinxxx: is data a string or an object or some html /
[12:15:08] <sphinxxx> its a string of html code
[12:15:13] <sphinxxx> returned from an ajax request
[12:15:40] <sphinxxx> its strange, this works fine ;  $(data).find("#something");
[12:15:57] <djQuery> well in that case whats h?
[12:16:02] <sphinxxx> but if i do , var h = "#something";    $(data).find(h);  it returns nothing
[12:18:59] <sphinxxx> am i missing something?
[12:19:32] <sphinxxx> actually to be more accurate, h = "#something" + m
[12:19:38] <sphinxxx> where m is a number, but as a string
[12:19:58] <djQuery> sphinxxx: works fine here in chrome http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/d9GVc/
[12:20:17] <djQuery> damn my chat client is laggin
[12:22:46] <aaronmcadam> ?eval !+[]
[12:22:47] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: true
[12:23:02] <djQuery> sphinxxx: so edit the example I sent you and see if you can replicate. if so paste it back in
[12:24:45] <sphinxxx> ah djquery nevermind
[12:24:49] <sphinxxx> i'm silly
[12:30:13] <stan_man_can> http://cbs.etylogic.com -- I wrote this for myself at work. As you type in a box it does an ajax call to narrow down the list.
[12:30:47] <stan_man_can> It works great for me, but clearly it requires a bunch of traffic since looking up a single code could be 5-7 hits (and 5-7 DB queries)
[12:31:33] <stan_man_can> I'd like to recreate it in JS so they only load all the codes once and all the narrowing can be handled client side
[12:31:40] <stan_man_can> how difficult would that be? my JS is pretty weak
[12:32:42] <sphinxxx> why don't you pull the full list and hten use js to parse it when they type
[12:33:08] <kborchers> stan_man_can: you could tweak UI's autocomplete to do that for you. i am currently doing something similar to filter an image gallery
[12:33:56] <stan_man_can> sphinxxx: thats what my plan is but I don't even know where to start. my knowledge of JS and it's objects is next to nothing
[12:34:13] <stan_man_can> i can fiddle with jQuery to do a few effects and ajax calls but thats about it
[12:34:29] <phlp> stan_man_can: http://mleibman.github.com/SlickGrid/examples/example-header-row.html
[12:34:45] <djQuery> stan_man_can: if you allready have the list there client side why not just filter it client side?
[12:35:29] <stan_man_can> djQuery: thats the plan, thats what I'm asking, how would I get started
[12:36:09] <stan_man_can> phlp: that looks like exactly what i need
[12:37:00] <djQuery> stan_man_can: a lot of the grid plugins will have a filtering plugin that goes with them.
[12:37:17] <djQuery> stan_man_can: I have used jqgrid and there is also datatables
[12:40:30] <stan_man_can> would you recommend slickgrid?
[12:44:06] <djQuery> stan_man_can: only because I haven't used it bfore
[12:44:08] <buttersb> question. http://pastie.org/2510133 - in the first console.log on line 8, region sometimes will be blank even though I've overwritten it on line 7
[12:44:26] <buttersb> i know that line 7 (page.default_params.region) has data, so what am I doing wrong ?
[12:44:46] <buttersb> sorry for the ugly code, im in the midst of trying to debug, and thus have log() all over.
[12:44:59] <djQuery> stan_man_can: for a project I need more the ajax + filtering that jqgrid offered
[12:47:16] <stan_man_can> djQuery: ah, gotcha
[12:47:41] <stan_man_can> djQuery: let me try and figure it out, i'm not the most savvy at picking these things up :P
[12:48:24] <djQuery> According to a NASA press conference today, you have a 1-in-21 trillion chance of being hit by falling debris.
[12:49:04] <buttersb> nice. there's hope djQuery
[12:49:25] <stan_man_can> djQuery: the code looks a little confusing
[12:51:46] <buttersb> any ideas?
[12:52:56] <stan_man_can> buttersb: youre checking page.State
[12:52:59] <stan_man_can> not page.State.region
[12:53:09] <stan_man_can> if thats not it i have no clue
[12:53:22] <stan_man_can> my JS is weak/non-excistant
[12:53:37] <stan_man_can> existant*
[12:53:38] <buttersb> what line you referrin to stan_man_can
[12:53:44] <stan_man_can> 8
[12:53:54] <stan_man_can> console.log('checkstate replaced region',page.State)
[12:55:18] <etcetera> is it possible to have jquery programatically trigger a form post by issuing a programattic click event against an input button?
[12:55:24] <stan_man_can> djQuery: I wrote the app for myself, but they're talking about implementing it nationally, so if they move forward they'll be sending about 4-5K people to it
[12:55:32] <buttersb> yes etcetera , @trigger
[12:55:37] <buttersb> ?trigger
[12:55:37] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[12:55:38] <PrgmrBill> etcetera: sure but $('#yourForm').submit() might be easier
[12:55:47] <etcetera> PrgmrBill: good call.
[12:55:58] <buttersb> or what PrgmrBill suggested is the more standard way.
[12:56:43] <buttersb> so page.State when logged out shows region:'', but logging out page.State.region shows "us" , what am i missing?
[12:56:49] <buttersb> that doesn't make sense.
[12:57:03] <buttersb> page.State.region is a part of the page.State obj
[12:57:40] <djQuery> stan_man_can: cool are they going to compensate you as well
[12:58:21] <buttersb> ok, im confused. I just logged them out one after another, and page.State shows region : '', and page.State.region outputs 'us'
[12:58:25] <stan_man_can> djQuery: Probably not, but i'm happy to contibute
[12:58:39] <stan_man_can> my version only took me about 5 hours, the rewrite might take a bit longer
[12:58:56] <stan_man_can> hopefully help in a promotion :P
[12:59:16] <buttersb> Can you explain that to me djQuery ?
[13:00:42] <jaydesign> Hello... newbie here :D
[13:02:21] <djQuery> buttersb: sorry xplain what?
[13:02:56] <buttersb> http://pastie.org/2510133
[13:03:51] <buttersb> basically, how is checkstate2 giving me 'us', but the first checkstate shows region : ''
[13:04:30] <djQuery> dunno
[13:04:59] <djQuery> buttersb: hence me not speaking up when u orig posted
[13:05:18] <buttersb> ah, my fault. thought maybe you were looking at something else.
[13:05:42] <buttersb> I cannot seem to EVER overwrite that region property, no matter what.
[13:05:47] <buttersb> its being a pain in the butt.
[13:09:50] <djQuery> Mrs.Buttersworth:   errr buttersb: could it be a browser limitiation that it wont allow u to overwrite the browsers regison?
[13:13:12] <ccmonsters> blah.
[13:21:32] <ccmonsters> i just dont get why i cant overwrite the objects properties anytime i want. it's like it's impervious
[13:33:04] <kanja1> I'm trying to make a CORS request, and include credentials - it's working on chrome, but it looks like I can't get ff to send cookies. http://dpaste.com/612087/
[13:34:13] <kanja1> I can't see anything I'm missing - I tried without specifying a data body originally, but adding one in didn't seem to force cookies.
[13:34:18] <sphinxxx> whats that plugin that scrolls a div to stay in the window, when a user scrolls down a page?
[13:34:35] <ngharo> css - position: fixed;
[13:34:52] <bryricker1> hey, does jquery-ui have a built-in replacement for standard HTML select menus, or is that not yet officially implemented?
[13:35:31] <kanja1> shouldn't xhrFields - withCredentials: true force the cookies to be sent with an options request?
[13:35:45] <ngharo> bryricker1: not yet.  there are plugins though
[13:35:53] <ngharo> ?ui.selectmenu @ bryricker1
[13:35:56] <bot-t> bryricker1, #8718 (replace is not a function) – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 5 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8718
[13:36:01] <ngharo> derp
[13:36:13] <ciss> just in case anyone remembered my question regarding the deep copy of an object crashing ie6: the solution was to split up the copying over multiple extend() calls
[13:36:18] <kborchers> bryricker1: not yet but in dev http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[13:36:31] <bryricker1> oh cool, thank you guys
[13:36:58] <kanja1> I know that if the options request comes back with a * for access-control-allow-origin the credentials wouldn't work for the real request, but that shouldn't effect the preflight, right?
[13:37:03] <ch3mical> Is there a way in jqUI to change the default button on dialogs?
[13:37:18] <mthurman> Hi all--I'm fairly new to jquery and I'm running into a bug very similar to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4652 after investigating I don't think 4652 is a duplicate of 3685 as claimed. I tried to put a fiddle together to illustrate http://jsfiddle.net/aX5pw/1/
[13:37:24] <djQuery> bryricker1: or you could just apply that styling to a normal select menu
[13:37:45] <djQuery> bryricker1: and if it is a big menu there is always see ?ui.autocomplete
[13:37:45] <bot-t> bryricker1, The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[13:38:04] <kborchers> ch3mical: what do you mean by "default button"?
[13:38:30] <djQuery> ch3mical: think there was a post recently about api changes in the ui.dialog that will handle teh focus better
[13:38:36] <ch3mical> kborchers: by default the first option is the one "selected" (highlighted, tab-stopped, whatever)
[13:39:01] <ch3mical> First button
[13:39:05] <ch3mical> Left-most
[13:39:10] <sean`> ch3mical, you can change the buttons
[13:39:18] <sean`> .dialog ('option', 'button', {}
[13:39:20] <sean`> )
[13:39:21] <ch3mical> I know that, sean`, thank you
[13:39:21] <sean`> rtfm
[13:39:23] <bryricker1> djQuery: It's a select menu for ~30 dates. What would be my best option here? Autocomplete doesn't seem right, but a normal select seems like it might be too large. Maybe #jquery isn't the best place to ask, since I suppose this isn't strictly a jquery question now.
[13:39:32] <kborchers> ch3mical: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/09/dialog-api-redesign/
[13:39:36] <ch3mical> sean`: I'm not trying to change the buttons, but thanks for being an ass :)
[13:39:52] <djQuery> ch3mical: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/09/dialog-api-redesign/
[13:40:11] <kborchers> djQuery: beat ya ;)
[13:40:14] <sean`> ow yeah
[13:40:47] <ch3mical> kborchers: how about a way to just make it not focus anything?
[13:41:47] <djQuery> bryricker1: yeah well they aren't very friendly in #design
[13:42:32] <bryricker> djQuery: I've stopped expecting friendliness on freenode, instead deciding to be surprised when I come across it. ;)
[13:42:50] <bryricker> actually freenode isn't that bad
[13:43:08] <bryricker> I suppose I'll just use a normal select tag for this
[13:43:43] <ch3mical> bryricker: in this channel anyway people are usually very helpful and courteous. Not all, (*looking at sean`*)... but most :)
[13:44:06] <kborchers> ch3mical: you could try something like $(".ui-dialog .ui-button").blur(); haven't tested but might work
[13:44:17] <kborchers> do that in the open event
[13:44:34] <ch3mical> kborchers: I'm trying to do that in the open function of the dialog, but it doesn't seem to be working
[13:44:38] <bryricker> ch3mical: #jquery is always great, that's true
[13:44:42] <kborchers> hmmmm
[13:44:59] <sean`> w00t
[13:45:00] <ch3mical> $(this).find('button:first').trigger("blur");
[13:45:03] <sean`> Someone's got love
[13:45:35] <sean`> There isnt an autoFocus yet, it's in design
[13:45:47] <sean`> So, if you want to remove the focus on the dialog itself, you'll have to implement it yourself
[13:45:58] <sean`> Unfortunately, the open callback fires before, so you'll have to hack it
[13:46:38] <ch3mical> sean`: not even relevant to what I'm asking, but thanks again for your constructive input
[13:46:38] <reliability> hi
[13:46:54] <sean`> ch3mical, i <3 u 2
[13:47:22] <ch3mical> kborchers: Apparently "this" isn't the dialog, it's what's IN the dialog, so that was my problem
[13:47:37] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: you ever play with coffeescript?
[13:47:38] <ch3mical> The buttons aren't "in" the dialog content
[13:47:57] <kborchers> right, i was just putting a demo together, that's why my selector had $(".ui-dialog .ui-button") ... instead of using this
[13:49:06] <kborchers> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/4VBRJ/1/
[13:49:06] <ch3mical> Gotcha. I had actually tried just $('[role="button"]') at first, but I must have been doing something else wrong
[13:49:19] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquerymobile: jQuery Mobile Beta 3 is now available on the Microsoft CDN - http://t.co/N706jvf â˜… http://bit.ly/qgJTHv
[13:50:55] <sean`> oh yeah
[13:50:58] <sean`> Luckily I was right
[13:52:13] <sean`> line 314:             self._trigger('open');
[13:52:47] <ch3mical> kborchers: thanks again
[13:52:50] <kborchers> np
[13:54:09] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: catch my random qusetion before?
[13:54:57] <kborchers> no i didn't ... and no i haven't. it's on that list of stuff i want to do that is really long but comes after the list of stuff i have to do which is longer :/
[13:56:32] <Dave_Stein> kborchers yeah it's come up from time to time here but i feel like it's so flexible it can easily make for bad coding habits. maybe i'm just crazy
[13:56:34] <djQuery> kborchers: ch3mical: this might be a little better http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/4VBRJ/1/
[13:57:27] <kborchers> djQuery: wrong link?
[13:57:50] <djQuery> kborchers: sorry it was still saving http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/4VBRJ/2/
[13:58:03] <reliability> Is there an easy way how to sanitize user input (textarea) with jquery?
[13:58:21] <sean`> reliability, sanatise asin?
[13:59:07] <kborchers> djQuery: yeah, you prob don't even need the .ui-dialog if you just make the context the dialog ... good call
[13:59:10] <djQuery> reliability: what I have done in the past is walk to thier desk and rap thier knukles with ruler
[13:59:30] <reliability> I mean... do sanity checks. For instance, just allowing just a certain set of characters... :)
[13:59:57] <sean`> reliability, you're better off googling for somethign like that, or creating your ownf ilter
[14:00:33] <reliability> In principle I could just run a regex over the thing before submitting... right? :)
[14:01:05] <djQuery> kborchers: keeps it from affecting all open dialogs
[14:01:12] <kborchers> right
[14:02:19] <sean`> reliability, yes
[14:02:33] <djQuery> heres me getting ready to go to someones desk http://goo.gl/36M2T
[14:02:38] <sean`> You could do that before sending, another option is to bind on keyup, but that's not user friendly, as they'll bel ike, wtf?
[14:03:34] <mytoz> pheeew.
[14:03:42] <sean`> weee
[14:03:47] <mytoz> finally done with the rough version of my documentation.
[14:03:54] <sean`> for what?
[14:04:11] <mytoz> dquery
[14:04:19] <sean`> ?
[14:04:52] <mytoz> https://github.com/torholm/dquery
[14:05:05] <mytoz> a small lib for playing with dates
[14:05:49] * mytoz shrugs
[14:06:40] <sean`> mytoz, so it's not accessible through the $ namespace
[14:07:26] <mytoz> sean`: nope
[14:07:31] <sean`> Why not?
[14:07:48] <mytoz> why should it? I wouldn't want to pollute it
[14:07:53] <kborchers> sean`: why would it?
[14:08:01] <sean`> 'cause of the name ;)
[14:08:12] <sean`> dquery, you'd expect it to play nice with jqueyr
[14:08:19] <mytoz> it does play nice with jquery ;)
[14:08:22] <sean`> Not saying it's bad, just expectations :-)
[14:08:28] <mytoz> it doesn't even pollute $. :)
[14:08:32] <sean`> hah
[14:08:33] <sean`> awes
[14:10:05] <mytoz> here's the documentation: http://torholm.github.com/dquery/
[14:10:18] <sean`> yeah
[14:10:22] <sean`> was checking out the API
[14:10:32] <mytoz> it's very rough, started out just a few hours ago with it
[14:10:33] <sean`> mytoz, have you checked out Date.js?
[14:10:45] <mytoz> yeah, took some inspiration from it
[14:10:56] <sean`> Any improvements worth mentioning?
[14:11:02] <mytoz> it's awesome except that it fondles Date.prototype
[14:11:11] <mytoz> and isn't actively maintained it seems.
[14:11:23] <mytoz> nothing particular, I think.  Date.js has had a lot of work put into it.
[14:11:56] <mytoz> perhaps the iterate/collect and DateList (undocumented)
[14:12:06] <sean`> Looks good
[14:13:39] <mytoz> I've been thinking of putting a layer over, which supports timezones
[14:14:04] <mytoz> but, timezones are so utterly complex
[14:16:28] <CrashTest_> I am trying to pull .text() out of a iframe that is loaded by a script I can't alter. Is there any way to detect when the content of that iframe has become available, and grab that text at that point?
[14:18:59] <kborchers> ?load @ CrashTest_
[14:19:00] <bot-t> CrashTest_, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[14:19:13] <sean`> CrashTest_, you can check the load event, and then use .contents ()
[14:19:15] <CrashTest_> kborchers:  I have tried load, and it never fires
[14:19:18] <sean`> that'll get you the document
[14:19:21] <kborchers> CrashTest_: then see ?contents
[14:19:21] <bot-t> CrashTest_, .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[14:19:34] <CrashTest_> kborchers:  Cool, I will read up on that!
[14:19:42] <kborchers> CrashTest_: then you aren't binding properly
[14:19:51] <CrashTest_> kborchers:  I don't doubt that :)
[14:24:25] <_41Ph4_> is there an alternative method for .html(). As that seems not to work correctly under IE8
[14:27:47] <erik-landvall> _41Ph4_: cant think if anything else that comes close but maybe .text() could help u *but this is not the same as .html()*
[14:28:03] <erik-landvall> or innerHTML if u like to go native :)
[14:28:52] <_41Ph4_> gonna give it a try
[14:28:53] <_41Ph4_> ty
[14:31:26] <Timmyo> hello, if i want to have a click function on an anchor that loads a new page, how do i execture the function after the page has been loaded?
[14:32:08] <Timmyo> execture, lol. 'execute'
[14:32:20] <Timmyo> i think i made up a new word
[14:32:43] <Hierofant> maybe live()
[14:33:42] <Timmyo> nope live doesn't work
[14:36:15] <rroelofs> Timmyo:  you really can't.  the page load starts a new context.
[14:36:29] <Timmyo> there must be some way
[14:36:44] <rroelofs> you could pass some data in the url
[14:36:55] <Timmyo> ah yes yes
[14:37:00] <rroelofs> so the new page knows to run the code
[14:37:03] <Timmyo> i'm only doing this for active states in a topnav.
[14:37:20] <Timmyo> i'm no good at passing data with urls, though :(
[14:37:22] <rroelofs> the other option is a cookie
[14:37:33] <Timmyo> cookie seems kinda drastic for active topnav states
[14:38:06] <rroelofs> what eo you mean by active states?
[14:38:21] <Timmyo> you know, click a link, it turns green and stays green so long as you're on that page
[14:38:46] <rroelofs> so you want it to still be green on the new page too?
[14:39:02] <Timmyo> yes think of it as it showing an active tab
[14:39:19] <Timmyo> so you click "contact" the "contact tab" stays a certain way, indicating that you are on the contact page
[14:39:27] <Timmyo> i usually do this with css but can't in this situation
[14:40:16] <rroelofs> so you could add #tabname to the href of the link and onload set a classname on that tab
[14:41:04] <Spadeski> How would I get the color of a pixel in hex with jquery using mousepoiint
[14:41:05] <Spadeski> ?
[14:41:30] <rroelofs> Timmyo: readi it back out with window.location.hash
[14:41:58] <rroelofs> gtg.  seeya
[14:43:10] <conee> anyone have experience dealing with nested jquery ui tabs?  i'm having some issues with hidden / visible elements when switching between levels of tabs
[14:43:28] <bryricker1> Hey, kind of hard to test here, but basically it's sending the browser to /cp/schedule_events/undefined/playlist/new. http://jsfiddle.net/MqwV9/ probably something obvious, but I am sort of new to jquery
[14:45:08] <conee> bryricker1: you want to send it to /212/ or something rather than undefined i assume?
[14:45:29] <conee> do either a .val() or .attr('value') if that's what you want
[14:45:48] <bryricker1> conee: oh yeah, I see .value isn't valid. Thanks!
[14:45:50] <conee> so $("#playlist_schedule_event_id option:selected").val() or $("#playlist_schedule_event_id option:selected").attr('value')
[14:46:13] <bryricker1> works great, thanks conee
[14:46:25] <conee> bryricker1: no problem
[14:47:15] <Hierofant> Timmyo that should be easy
[14:54:12] <eveningsky> my iframe is being closed by its contents, is there an event I can bind to for when the iframe closes?
[14:55:28] <PilotBob> Can anyone tell me why I can't seem to select an anchor where title= some value? Even trying to display the title property of an anchor I get "undefined"
[14:58:27] <PilotBob> so $("a[href='Home']) works but $("a[title='Home']) doesn't work? I don't understand why it doesn't work?
[14:59:01] <PilotBob> the tag in view source shows: <a data-nodesource="" data-nodeprovider="" href="Home">Home</a>
[15:00:09] <muzone> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBVdSIkxS7E HAHAHHAHAHHA
[15:00:24] <eveningsky> PilotBob: your anchor doesn't have a title
[15:00:45] <PilotBob> so <a data-nodesource="" data-nodeprovider="" href="Home">Home</a> doesn't have a title? what attrbitue would "Home" be in?
[15:00:59] <eveningsky> PilotBob: href
[15:01:27] <eveningsky> PilotBob: ....href="Home" title="home">
[15:01:33] <eveningsky> then you can search by title
[15:03:48] <PilotBob> What is the contents of the anchor called... ?? <a href'="#">Content</a>  ????
[15:04:15] <djQuery> PilotBob: innerhtml
[15:06:04] <PilotBob> ah, I guess I can't search by innerhtml?
[15:11:19] <Soothsayer> Anyone know of a light weight snippet / function to edit a query string value ?
[15:11:42] <jrockjiggz> replace()
[15:11:54] <PilotBob> thanks, I'll just add title to my a tag and be done with it. ;)
[15:12:22] <jrockjiggz> ?replace@Soothsayer
[15:12:23] <bot-t> Soothsayer, .replaceAll() - Replace each target element with the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/replaceAll/
[15:12:30] <jrockjiggz> hmm no
[15:12:37] <jrockjiggz> ?text

[15:44:49] <flayks> hi there, it's possible to make a marginLeft based draggable with jquery ui ? or a home made draggable based on marginleft?
[15:48:40] <JSM87> Hi guys, im having to use noconflict to stop it breaking my magento shopping cart (uses prototype) The problem is I have about 5 jquery plugins, how can I make them not use $ method and instead jQuery
[15:49:36] <radost> anyone know any rockstar ui devs in the Pasadena, CA area?
[15:49:59] <_41Ph4_> is there ne .append() or .html() like method that would work under the retarded Internet Explorer?
[15:50:06] <jrockjiggz> JSM87: say you do  $$$ = jQuery.noConflict();  right?
[15:50:19] <JSM87> yeh
[15:50:22] <_41Ph4_> append / html / innerhtml won't work
[15:50:38] <jrockjiggz> you can write you jquery inside a function like this:   $$$( function($){ //jquery code using $ here; }
[15:51:35] <JSM87> Please take a look at this as example of how I have tried to do it
[15:51:36] <JSM87> http://shop.halononbio.co.uk/skin/frontend/default/hellowired/js/jquery.nivo.slider.pack.js
[15:51:46] <JSM87> I did this
[15:51:46] <JSM87> jQuery(function($)
[15:52:19] <jrockjiggz> yes..
[15:52:26] <jrockjiggz> so is jQuery a valid object?
[15:53:12] <JSM87> jrockjiggz: Please also check this and go to the very bottom
[15:53:12] <JSM87> http://shop.halononbio.co.uk/skin/frontend/default/hellowired/js/jquery.latest.js
[15:53:59] <jrockjiggz> i think you need to assign it to a var
[15:54:44] <JSM87> jrockjiggz: even though I reference as jQuery(function($)
[15:55:12] <enjoycrf> yoyoyo
[16:01:01] <_41Ph4_> is there a method to .append / .html / .innerhtml in Internet Explorer??, none of those 3 works
[16:01:11] <wookiehangover> ...
[16:01:18] <wookiehangover> yes they do
[16:01:41] <_41Ph4_> i've tried those 3
[16:01:50] <_41Ph4_> and nothing is appended
[16:01:58] <wookiehangover> so there's something else going on with your code
[16:02:09] <coldhead> no, it sounds like a bug in jquery core, wookiehangover
[16:02:13] <_41Ph4_> but, is working under chrome/firefox
[16:02:26] <coldhead> ima file a ticket, thanks _41Ph4_
[16:02:52] <coldhead> _41Ph4_: can you get ANY JS in the same <script> to run?
[16:02:58] <coldhead> and are you sure your HTML is valid/sane?
[16:03:13] <_41Ph4_> i guess it is
[16:03:22] <_41Ph4_> everything is working fine under chrome/firefox
[16:03:37] <steveoliver> anyone know how to open a link in a new tab but keep the current (originating) window in focus?
[16:05:12] <coldhead> _41Ph4_: those browsers are more tolerant of errors
[16:05:21] <coldhead> they do mean EVERYTHING IS OKAY
[16:05:26] <coldhead> don't*
[16:05:31] <coldhead> good grief, coldhead
[16:06:22] <jrockjiggz> steveoliver: it looks like it can't be done
[16:06:40] <_41Ph4_> IE debugger says there's an Unexpected call to method or property
[16:06:46] <_41Ph4_> in line 5601 etc etc
[16:06:50] <steveoliver> jrockjiggz: see kayak.com
[16:07:09] <_41Ph4_> which is "append: function(){........this.appendChild(elem);}
[16:07:15] <steveoliver> that's essentially what I'm interested in (as strange and questionable the UX actually is)
[16:07:37] <jrockjiggz> which makes sense to me, it's not very secure when a website has the ability to open websites IN THE BACKGROUND
[16:07:59] <coldhead> _41Ph4_: can you reproduce the problem with as little code as possible at jsfiddle?
[16:08:13] <coldhead> and i will do you a test case there meanwhiile that proves they work
[16:11:32] <coldhead> _41Ph4_: does this work in your IE? http://jsfiddle.net/4fCG2/
[16:13:15] <_41Ph4_> yes it does
[16:13:23] <_41Ph4_> what's get(0)?
[16:13:40] <coldhead> it returns the actual DOM element
[16:13:47] <coldhead> without the jQuery trimmings
[16:13:57] <coldhead> innerHTML is not a jquery method
[16:14:13] <coldhead> you can also access it via $('p')[0]
[16:14:31] <coldhead> but pro-tip: you seldom need to, once you take jQuery into your heart
[16:16:15] <wreel> has anyone else noticed that slideUp() works differently on text than buttons? why is that?
[16:17:20] <coldhead> text and buttons are different? :D
[16:17:32] <_41Ph4_> so can previous code won't let it work?
[16:17:33] <coldhead> animations require elements to be display:block
[16:17:41] <coldhead> so maybe that's what you're seeing
[16:17:42] <wreel> ooh that could be the issue
[16:17:52] <JSM87> Hi guys, on step 6 of my checkout I do not get a submit button. I had a look at another shop and it has this, which I do not have: <button type="submit" title="Place Order" class="button btn-checkout" onclick="review.save();"><span><span>Place Order</span></span></button>
[16:17:54] <JSM87> Any idea
[16:18:04] <coldhead> wreel: you can usually wrap elements in a div or something and animate that for more consistency
[16:18:06] <wreel> coldhead: they are literally sliding in opposite directions which was certainly a surprise to see
[16:18:26] <wreel> that's actually what i tried to do
[16:18:34] <wreel> but just selecting the div by itself didn't seem to animate the stuff inside.
[16:18:36] <coldhead> <_41Ph4_> so can previous code won't let it work? <-- previous code? I DON'T UNDERSTAND
[16:18:53] <wreel> so now i'm using $('div#mydiv > *')
[16:19:05] <coldhead> gross, wreel :)
[16:19:11] <coldhead> try messing with the CSS
[16:19:17] <wreel> i'm open to suggestions, i'm a noob with this stuff
[16:19:28] <wreel> just making a little app for fun
[16:19:37] <wreel> (and learning)
[16:20:11] <wreel> let me check the display on them first, and then maybe animating the div will work
[16:20:16] <coldhead> JSM87: ignoring everything else that's wrong and horrible with your code, does <iput type="submit" work, instead of <button ?
[16:20:38] <JSM87> coldhead: there is no button in the first place
[16:20:44] <JSM87> not even <button
[16:20:48] <coldhead> wreel: share a link if you can't get it happening
[16:21:15] <coldhead> JSM87: button {display:block!important}
[16:21:28] <wreel> coldhead: cool, but if you thought that was gross, you might need to grab a puke bucket if i paste this stuff.. ;)
[16:21:53] <coldhead> wreel: link to a working demo, then maybe i won't have to look at the coads
[16:21:53] <JSM87> coldhead: there is no <button>
[16:22:03] <JSM87> i have firebug open on it
[16:22:18] <coldhead> and it's visible when you view source, JSM87 ?
[16:22:32] <JSM87> coldhead: no
[16:23:10] <JSM87> coldhead: Its ok, I used this fix
[16:23:12] <JSM87> http://blog.allgiftsdirect.co.uk/magneto/magento-checkout-out-confirm-order-button-missing-fix/
[16:23:21] <JSM87> no idea why I had to do that to get it to work, crazy
[16:23:27] <coldhead> oh fuck, why can't this be #magento's problem?
[16:23:29] <coldhead> :D
[16:24:17] <coldhead> if you have the button in your HTMl and it isn't showing there's very little #jQuery can do about it
[16:24:28] <coldhead> especially when you're using onclick like a cavemane
[16:24:34] <coldhead> caveman*
[16:24:37] <coldhead> or cavewoman*
[16:24:56] <JSM87> coldhead: im using hellowired template
[16:25:01] <JSM87> Im not building it from scratch
[16:25:30] <JSM87> coldhead: Do you use a template or edit the default one to suit needs
[16:25:50] <coldhead> JSM87: this is #jQuery, you realise
[16:25:56] <coldhead> please realise
[16:25:58] <coldhead> please
[16:26:09] <JSM87> Oops! I do have #magento tab open
[16:26:15] <JSM87> Ha, no wonder for confusion
[16:26:45] <coldhead> confusion, and, increasingly, rage
[16:26:50] <coldhead> good luck with that!
[16:28:07] <wreel> coldhead: does everything inside the div need to be display: block before i should expect to see sane results?
[16:28:32] <coldhead> wreel: my technique just has the div display:block and i animate that directly
[16:28:40] <wreel> oh, gotcha
[16:28:48] <coldhead> then the innards can be whatever you need
[16:28:50] <coldhead> i don't care
[16:28:55] <coldhead> i refuse to deal with them
[16:29:46] <wreel> coldhead: that did the trick!
[16:29:48] <coldhead> no, _41Ph4_, REALLY, it was MY PLEASURE
[16:29:51] <coldhead> you fucking ingrate
[16:29:58] <coldhead> oh good job, wreel
[16:30:02] <wreel> looks quite nice now
[16:30:08] <coldhead> yay!
[16:30:10] <wreel> thanks!
[16:30:25] <coldhead> wreel: you should look into animate() and doing custom animations
[16:30:33] <coldhead> if you're a stickler for fanciness
[16:30:38] <coldhead> it's pretty easy
[16:31:24] <wreel> i saw some neat stuff with the demos but opted to do this for now. i just want a little UI feedback that something is moving, so i slideUp() the div from its original location and slideDown() it in the new location
[16:32:09] <coldhead> sure
[16:32:14] <coldhead> but keep animate in mind
[16:32:23] <wreel> will do
[16:32:24] <coldhead> it's no trouble :)
[16:32:37] <enjoycrf> can we play ace of base :D
[16:33:34] <coldhead> headphones, enjoycrf
[16:33:49] <enjoycrf> no lets play it loud
[16:39:22] <wreel> coldhead: any chance you could distill your "gross" comment earlier into a stylistic guideline? ie, is it generally inadvisable to use those child/descendent selectors? i realize they are dynamic and thus are probably harder to maintain code correctness, but is there more?
[16:39:48] <coldhead> it's nothing so fancy as that, it's just overcomplicated
[16:39:59] <wreel> ah, alrighty
[16:40:07] <coldhead> you're writing more code and asking jquery to do more work
[16:40:14] <coldhead> and i'm terribly lazy
[16:40:16] <wreel> one of the challenges i'm finding while learning all of this is trying to get a sense of good principles
[16:40:21] <coldhead> keep it simple and all that
[16:40:40] <coldhead> yeah sure
[16:40:45] <unmgmt> anyone here using phonegap with jquery?
[16:40:51] <wreel> i mean, i have this ridiculous spaghetti mess of jquery callbacks linked to callbacks in one giant function, which would make me pull my hair out if i saw that in any other language
[16:40:54] <coldhead> but i guess the best way to do that is to read good code, not pithy summations
[16:41:12] <wreel> but it doesn't exactly seem like there are nice ways to refactor it
[16:42:04] <coldhead> it's a relatively new craft and there are different opionions but there are definitely nice patterns emerging for how to write clean elegant jQuery
[16:42:16] <wreel> cool, that's good to hear
[16:42:45] <wreel> i've had the same curiosity with respect to the ajax barrier, since half the time it seems like i could either put code in my back-end or in javascript
[16:42:54] <coldhead> check out the yayquery podcast and check out the diverse offerings of its hosts
[16:43:06] <wreel> so far i've just been trying to keep the back-end for data storage/retrieval only, but that is a fairly artificial boundary
[16:43:15] <wreel> ooh, interesting
[16:43:38] <coldhead> wreel: if you're heading down the javascript application path, look into backbone/spine/sproutcore
[16:44:03] <coldhead> that's getting pretty well solved
[16:44:11] <coldhead> MVC in the browser type thing
[16:44:15] <wreel> noted. i haven't heard of any of those
[16:44:30] <wreel> yeah i was trying to put it into an MVC sort of context
[16:46:10] <wreel> thanks again, i'll check out that stuff
[16:46:28] <coldhead> you're very welcome
[16:46:31] <coldhead> have fun
[16:46:36] <wreel> will do :)
[16:50:52] <enjoycrf> i have 5 callnbacks
[16:50:58] <enjoycrf> wtfff
[16:51:12] <enjoycrf> need to THINK lol
[16:51:48] <enjoycrf> 5 sql calls or 2 sql calls
[16:54:37] <abjorn> 20 sql calls!
[16:56:59] <abjorn> ITS MOOORE THAAN A FEEELIIIINNNN, MORE THAN A FEEEELLIIINNN
[17:11:16] <ColKurtz> my go-to plugin for tooltips used to be qtip
[17:11:32] <ColKurtz> but i dont' want to use the old version and the new version doesn't seem to be stable
[17:11:40] <ColKurtz> anybody have a favorite?
[17:11:41] <jgspratt> what does \$("div.field > :input", this).each(function() do?  I don't even know what to call that.
[17:13:01] <kborchers> jgspratt: that selects every input that is a child of div's with a class of field all within the context of this (which you can't tell what this is in this snippet) and then performs some function on each of those inputs
[17:15:16] <jgspratt> kborchers: ok, I'm trying to get http://jsfiddle.net/eX4Ut/ to run on a different html file than the one I found it on
[17:16:18] <jgspratt> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/eX4Ut/2/ for the html I am trying to select
[17:16:54] <savid> Anyone know where I can find a good boilerplate for a jquery plugin?  I want a plugin that supports multiple namespaced methods, and options.
[17:17:01] <kborchers> jgspratt: so basically you are just trying to do form validation, correct?
[17:17:05] <jgspratt> what I want to happen is to get a pop-up when I don't fill out the right fields
[17:17:14] <jgspratt> yes, right!
[17:17:23] <kborchers> ?validation @ jgspratt
[17:17:24] <bot-t> jgspratt, Plugins/Validation - "But doesn't jQuery make it so very easy to write your own validation plugin?" Sure, but there still are a lot of subtleties that you have to worry about: You need a standard library of validation ... http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/validation
[17:18:06] <kborchers> easy to use and written by one of the lead devs on the jQuery UI team
[17:18:23] <jgspratt> hmm
[17:20:20] <jgspratt> how do I... get it
[17:20:36] <kborchers> by default it doesn't use a dialog to show errors but you could easily get it to do that in the invalidHandler
[17:20:50] <jgspratt> oh, I don't need a dialog
[17:21:02] <kborchers> go here http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[17:22:50] <kborchers> jgspratt: look through the demos and you can see you just set up some classes for error states (to highlight your fields, etc.) and you can use a class called required on your elements which tells the plugin which ones to validate.
[17:22:51] <jgspratt> thanks!
[17:23:01] <kborchers> the demos should get you in the right direction
[17:23:11] <jgspratt> sure thing. I'll do it on Monday.
[19:09:41] <walterjab> test
[19:10:07] <kborchers> test failed ;)
[19:13:57] <walterjab> Sorry, I'm new here :-)
[19:14:15] <kborchers> no prob, just a bad joke
[19:43:36] <bambanx> hello
[19:44:04] <bambanx> iam new on javascript and i need manipulate images scaele resize etc... , jquery is good for that?
[19:44:19] <bobbobbins> hey, im using highcharts, anyone know how to make the categories on the xaxis appear even if there is no data?
[19:45:25] <tnorris> bambanx: you can use css to resize the image on the site, but that's not optimal. much better that you create the images in the correct size before they're displayed.
[19:46:13] <bambanx> no i need interaction with the user
[19:46:33] <tnorris> bambanx: then you'll need to use html5 canvas.
[19:46:50] <Kamakazi> Style question: I have a table I will be using jquery to add rows to the table (for more input fields), what is the easiest way to give them all unique intellible names? Do I just need to have something that counts them and then append the number onto the id?
[19:47:20] <bambanx> my idea is , in my site use a format for imges, and the user when upload his images can scale to my format (sorry for my english)
[19:47:55] <kborchers> Kamakazi: yep, if you get the index() of the last row before inserting a new one, then you can create your inputs with a name and append that number plus one see ?index
[19:47:55] <bot-t> Kamakazi, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[19:48:07] <nebbie> Kamakazi: u can set them with classes of rows and columns like spreadsheets and use that to pick out what u need, just a thought
[19:48:23] <bambanx> tnorris: like a frame with my image like exampe and the user can scale his image to my format
[19:48:45] <tnorris> bambanx: do you have an example site?
[19:48:52] <bambanx> not yet
[19:48:56] <Kamakazi> oh bot-t you read my mind, I <3 bots
[19:49:11] * balr0g hello.
[19:49:16] <Kamakazi> howdy
[19:49:44] <bambanx> tnorris: is idea i have , for the user can optimize his images to my format image size of my site
[19:50:43] <destinydriven> hey guys, I need some help with votes please. Can you go on this page and like my friend's pic please? http://www.metro.co.tt/getconnected/entries/cassi-mc-kie.  She really wants to win the smart-phone prize. thanks
[19:50:47] <tnorris> bambanx: look around for something close to what you want. the functionality request is quite complex.
[19:51:13] <bambanx> tnorris: i dont have idea how found it
[19:52:11] <tnorris> search for keywords that you've used here (e.g. website, image, resize, dynamic, interact). might take some time, but would be quicker in the long run, imho.
[19:52:17] <bambanx> tnorris: well i will continue googleiting :)
[19:52:26] <bambanx> tnorris: thanks
[19:52:29] <tnorris> heh, good luck. np.
[19:53:51] <bambanx> tnorris: if i will need program some like that you think jquery is the way or other framework?
[19:54:40] <tnorris> don't think that jQuery is what you'll want. checkout something like http://www.pixastic.com/
[19:55:24] <bambanx> ok
[19:56:36] <jedimind_> destinydriven, i would, but putting aside the fact that you're spamming this shit around pointlessly, i am actually not at all impressed with the pic
[19:56:42] <jedimind_> and sincerely hope a more deserving candidate wins
[19:57:05] <jedimind_> but thanks for being a douche none the less
[19:57:19] <destinydriven> jedimind, sorry, this isn't something that I would normally do. Just trying to help a friend out
[19:58:03] <jedimind_> write up why she deserves to win, and post it on reddit, not here :)
[19:58:28] <bambanx> tnorris: i found this http://www.plupload.com/ too
[19:58:37] <destinydriven> sorry
[19:59:40] <tnorris> looks good. if you want to learn how to do it yourself i would suggest looking through that source.
[20:06:42] <Kamakazi> Shouldn't this return how many elements with the id "example" there are in the DOM $("#example").length
[20:07:19] <kborchers> Kamakazi: yes, which would be one since id's are you unique and you don't use that id more than once, right?
[20:07:36] <Kamakazi> I should be using a class and no id for this purpose then
[20:07:42] <kborchers> yep
[20:08:48] <Kamakazi> thanks
[20:08:53] <kborchers> np
[20:08:58] <Kamakazi> that is something I wouldn't have figured out easily
[20:33:36] <dumbledore> I know jQuery supports dragging stuff but does it support dragging stuff using an iPad?
[20:33:44] <ShawnRisk> I am using Drupal 6.22 and curious to know how to stop the slideshow from moving on this page: http://ecosanity.org/Â I am using jQuery but this didn't stop even when I took the code away.
[20:34:30] <dumbledore> drag&drop, PC&iPad ??
[20:39:48] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: i hate drupal! makes such a mess of the source. anyway, you should be able to do jQuery('.slides').cycle("stop"); to stop it
[20:40:18] <ShawnRisk> put that where?
[20:40:47] <kborchers> how do you want to stop it? with a click? on page load?
[20:42:01] <ShawnRisk> kborchers: on page load I just want the whole slideshow to not cycle anymore.  The only way to change the image is if you click the thumbnails.
[20:47:28] <Kamakazi> is there an easier way to find out which checkboxes on a screen are checked other than just looping through them and checking the "checked" attr?
[20:48:40] <kborchers> ShawnRisk: i would say try adding autostop: 1 and autostopCount: 0 to http://ecosanity.org/sites/all/themes/ecoSanity/js/utility.js?lraeh1 where cycle is initialized and see if that works, if not, you could try adding jQuery('.slides').cycle('stop'); to your jQuery(document).ready on line 77 (of the viewable source, probably not the same line in your page source)
[20:49:24] <kborchers> ?:checked @ Kamakazi
[20:49:25] <bot-t> Kamakazi, :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[20:53:34] <Kamakazi> thanks
[21:01:17] <Onions> How can I loop through json encoded data easily? I want each {} per loop not each character
[21:03:41] <coldhead> you shouldn't be dealing with JSON directly
[21:03:51] <coldhead> you need to decode it
[21:04:00] <Onions> How :o
[21:04:02] <coldhead> and you'll have a bona fide JS object
[21:04:12] <coldhead> how are you obtaining it?
[21:04:21] <Onions> $.post
[21:04:35] <coldhead> dataType: 'json'
[21:04:36] <Onions> using the .success(function(data) {
[21:04:39] <Onions> right
[21:04:43] <coldhead> check the docs :D
[21:04:44] <coldhead> ?post
[21:04:45] <bot-t> jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[21:04:59] <Onions> :o
[21:05:03] <coldhead> oh look, you can just specify 'json' after the success function
[21:05:08] <coldhead> thanks, post()!
[21:05:11] <coldhead> take 5
[21:06:33] <kborchers> oh coldhead, where have you been all night. i've missed your witty response :)
[21:07:27] <Onions> 	$.post("chat.php","step=build&cookie=" + document.cookie,'json').success(function (data) {
[21:07:31] <Onions> ^ what should that be xD
[21:16:50] <SinnerNyx> how would I go about making an element of undetermined size, appear over top of the center of another element? Or is there some way to determine the size of that element?
[21:17:33] <SinnerNyx> essentially I want to overlay a small message box, on top of a picture before fading it out.
[21:25:35] <stan_man_can> https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid
[21:25:45] <stan_man_can> anyone used that before? it does what I need, i just have NO clue how to use it
[21:54:43] <Hornet> any good jquery/javascript books emerged recently?
[21:54:56] <CrashTest_> so confused. I am trying to use .load() to wait for a div to be loaded by another script, yet it is not seeming to fire. Do I do $('#id-of-item-I-am-waiting-for').load(function(){ $(this).contents().find('.stuff-i-want-out-of-it').html() }); ?
[21:55:00] <Hornet> or indeed any older ones that are also worthwhile
[21:55:28] <Hornet> iirc, load is for initial page load
[21:55:33] <Hornet> you may want .live
[21:57:33] <CrashTest_> Hornet:  My company has a js initiative going on, we are looking at JavaScript the Good Parts, Object Oriented JavaScript, JavaScript Patterns: Build Better Applications with Coding and Design Pattern, Eloquent JavaScript,
[21:57:58] <CrashTest_> (book club, not initiative, gah! so tired)
[21:58:00] <Hornet> the good parts reads like a compiler manual :\
[21:58:02] <tonyjcamp> <3 eloquent and js patterns
[21:58:21] <Hornet> railroad diagrams are good for parsers, not humans
[21:58:42] <Hornet> but I've read eloquent and OO JS, both are good
[21:58:47] <Hornet> looking into the others
[21:59:35] <tonyjcamp> Those diagrams are weird at first, but then they're really useful.
[21:59:53] <tonyjcamp> javascript enlightenment is pretty good too.
[22:01:33] <CrashTest_> Hornet:  Live never fires either.
[22:26:16] <Hornet> hrm, what's a tactful way to mention on one's portfolio that a site has been worked on by monkeys since it was originally developed, and the code quality isn't to be judged as ours?
[22:34:29] <tonyjcamp> is this the party room?
[22:34:32] <tonyjcamp> a/s/l
[23:05:33] <SinnerNyx> hello, i asked this a few hours ago but my network cut out :S.. If I wanted to center an element of unknown dimensions on top of another element, how would I go about doing this?
[23:05:56] <SinnerNyx> I presume I will probably need to somehow calculate the dimensions of the inner element? can this be done?
[23:37:24] <SinnerNyx> I am trying to display an element (unknown dimensions) overlayed on top and centered on another element. I presume I will probably need to somehow calculate the dimensions of the inner element? can this be done?
[23:55:54] <Thomas`-> hi all. is if i want to do $("#mydiv").find(".thechild") how could i return boolean value to check if it found it?
[23:58:20] <saganbyte> Thomas`-, $("#mydiv").find(".thechild").size()
[23:58:39] <saganbyte> Thomas`-, If that returns a value then it means it found it else not
[23:59:13] <saganbyte> Thomas`-, I mean if that returns a value greater than 0
[23:59:16] <Thomas`-> or .length maybe?
[23:59:46] <saganbyte> Thomas`-, do you use firebug or any dev tools in the browser?
[23:59:58] <saganbyte> If so then you could try it out in the consile
