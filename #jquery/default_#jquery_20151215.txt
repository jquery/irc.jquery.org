[00:14:06] <neanderslob> Hi all, I'm attempting to make a menu appear by growing out horizontally with .animate() code here: http://jsfiddle.net/neanderslob/wLf647tu/15/
[00:15:24] <neanderslob> it's pretty straightforward but I'm having an issue where, early on in the animation, the menu stacks vertically, until there's enough room for it to grow horizontally
[00:15:36] <neanderslob> (this can be seen clearly in the hover animation)
[00:16:58] <neanderslob> I was wondering how to prevent this large vertical stack from happening; I was playing around with setting the height for the containing div but was wondering if there was a better way

[03:14:02] <shibly> Is there any other tool like firebug? Is firebug good?
[03:14:25] <Cork> shibly: there are the ones built into all browsers now days
[03:15:03] <shibly> But firebug looks better tool. Isn't it?
[03:15:25] <Cork> well firebug is only good in firefox
[03:15:39] <Cork> and ya, it still beats the other inspectors
[03:15:48] <Cork> but it is more a matter of taste now days
[03:15:49] <shibly> I don't use chrome
[03:15:58] <shibly> I use firefox.
[03:17:21] <shibly> jsfiddle.net is a nice tool to check css and javascript
[03:21:34] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:22:12] <jomofcw> I'm using jQuery UI combobox. Is there a way to know wich result line has the focus when the user move the selection using the arrow key ?
[03:23:08] <jomofcw> *autocomplete, not "combobox"
[03:24:30] <Halisarne> Hello lads, im trying to use multiple controlgroups with radiobuttons on one of my pages, everything works just fine when i only got one controlgroup tho when i add a new one the first one disapears. How do i solve that?
[03:24:32] <Cork> jomofcw: the focus event
[03:24:39] <Cork> https://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-focus
[03:26:25] <blue_in_code_> Hi jquery developers, I need your assistance. How do you select a background form element from a bootstrap modal using jquery. Thanks in advance.
[03:38:33] <Halisarne> Hello lads, im trying to use multiple controlgroups with radiobuttons on one of my pages, everything works just fine when i only got one controlgroup tho when i add a new one the first one disapears. How do i solve that? Thanks in advance!
[03:41:51] <shibly> Why doesn't it display alert box? http://jsfiddle.net/ogmn6h0b/2/
[03:42:04] <game0> hello, I'm new to jquery and I'm trying to read ajax objects from url, but I'm facing some problem in the code, can someone help me with that?
[03:42:14] <game0> http://pastebin.com/dJtNpePk
[03:42:22] <game0> http://pastebin.com/H0k747DL
[03:42:34] <game0> this is my code
[03:47:24] <shibly> <a href='#' onclick='alert("hello");return false;'>Click here !</a> , What does return false do?
[03:47:57] <Cork> shibly: it is a old hacky way to do the same thing as event.preventDefault; event.stopImitiatePropagation()
[03:48:19] <Cork> shibly: also don't use event attributes
[03:48:27] <Cork> and finally don't abuse links
[03:48:36] <Cork> if you want a click action use a button
[03:48:43] <shibly> http://jsfiddle.net/ogmn6h0b/10/ , it doesn't stop alerting
[03:48:43] <Cork> (as in <button>)
[03:49:01] <Cork> uh
[03:49:03] <Cork> why would it?
[03:49:42] <shibly> Then what does it stop?
[03:50:04] <Cork> it prevents the browsers default actiobn
[03:50:06] <Cork> *action
[03:50:18] <Cork> and it prevents all additional event handlers bound to the element
[03:51:03] <shibly> But it will not stop the click event(=alerting)
[03:51:26] <Cork> shibly: this is what you should do instead https://jsfiddle.net/ogmn6h0b/14/
[03:51:28] <shibly> How can i even stop click event(=alerting)?
[03:51:41] <Cork> shibly: by not calling alert?
[03:52:17] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/ogmn6h0b/15/ <-- fixed a typo
[04:15:41] <PokerGod> doing a section.html('') doesn't seem to erase a DataTable inside that section.
[04:16:12] <Cork> PokerGod: what makes you say that?
[04:16:46] <PokerGod> $.fn.dataTable.isDataTable('#main') will be true
[04:19:36] <PokerGod> sigh, previous tab in the way
[04:21:49] <Cork> PokerGod: you could try .empty() instead of .html('')
[04:22:06] <PokerGod> is empty() better?
[04:22:12] <Cork> but other then that it sounds like that would be a bug in dataTable
[04:22:23] <Cork> PokerGod: it is more readable if nothing else
[04:22:33] <Cork> if i remember correctly both do data cleanup
[04:23:54] <Cork> ya, just checked
[04:24:14] <PokerGod> my on('hide.bs.tab', function(e) {}) doesn't fire.  Does that event need to be on body? or something
[04:24:44] <Cork> uh
[04:24:50] <Cork> you have an element <hide> ?
[04:25:03] <PokerGod> tabs from bootstrap
[04:25:13] <Cork> you're sure you didn't mean .hide?
[04:25:20] <PokerGod> the shown.bs.tabs will fire
[04:25:35] <Cork> ah, right, event not selector
[04:25:54] <Cork> PokerGod: well depends on what element you bind it on
[04:26:30] <PokerGod> does it typically need to be the parent when it comes to the tabs?
[04:26:45] <Cork> uh
[04:27:05] <Cork> if the element is replaced the event handler gets removed by the browser (as the dom element is what keeps the handler alive)
[04:27:40] <PokerGod> so with the hidden stuff, always do body?
[04:28:04] <Cork> i don't even know what that question would mean
[04:28:18] <Cork> note i haven't seen your code, so i can't know what you know
[04:29:29] <Cork> PokerGod: if you want help with a specific code snippet, make a jsfiddle
[04:30:34] <PokerGod> okay
[04:30:50] <PokerGod> which is the best browser to debug events?  firefox?
[04:31:25] <Cork> O_o
[04:31:33] <Cork> events are events
[04:31:41] <Cork> there isn't any better/worse browser

[04:43:11] <Deinos> hello
[04:43:39] <Deinos> I got a question: If I let an animation run and it increments indefinitely, Do I have to worry about that?
[04:44:03] <Cork> worry about what?
[04:44:17] <Deinos> as in, will it get slower, will there be an overflow
[04:44:48] <Cork> uh
[04:44:59] <Cork> you mean a variable in increasing indefinitely
[04:44:59] <Deinos> the number of degrees that it turns just keeps pumping, but I didn't realize any setback yet so far
[04:45:03] <Deinos> yeah
[04:45:05] <Cork> or what are you asking actually?
[04:45:19] <Cork> h
[04:45:22] <Cork> *ah
[04:45:29] <Cork> well you have wrap around like any language
[04:45:40] <Cork> javascript is type safe so you won't ever get overflow
[04:46:02] <Cork> so ya you are most likely better of using % 360
[04:46:34] <Deinos> well since im using a plugin im not sure how to do that, its called velocity, let me fiddle you something
[04:52:49] <Deinos> uh... fking plugin, so I just figured out, if I use it in "forward" rotation it does exactly that, go up and down 360°
[04:53:01] <Deinos> but if I inverse the direction it simply increments..
[04:53:02] <Deinos> -_-
[04:53:49] <Deinos> http://jsfiddle.net/L472tzjd
[04:54:45] <Deinos> so yeah what I mean is, the element style information gets updated and increases indefinitely, will the size of the number slow down the script at some point?
[04:56:14] <Deinos> @Cork what does it mean to have a wrap around?
[04:57:31] <Cork> Deinos: Number.MAX_VALUE + 1 == NUMBER.MIN_VALUE
[04:57:40] <Cork> opps
[04:57:44] <Deinos> :D
[04:57:48] <Cork> * Number.MIN_VALUE
[04:58:22] <Cork> it is easier to explain in bit
[04:58:37] <Cork> 1111111 + 1 = 0000000
[04:58:48] <Deinos> so at some point it will revert to a very large negative number and count up if I use the highest possible max value?
[04:58:58] <Cork> yes
[04:59:15] <Cork> though javascript uses floats
[04:59:17] <nru> can maybe someone help me with this text: http://pastebin.com/xn2HvF2g < does this now say that in a form post i need to send special characters encoded or not?
[04:59:24] <Cork> so that isn't fully true there
[04:59:28] <Deinos> and the same goes for the opposit i suppose? min_val - 1 == max_value
[04:59:41] <Cork> Deinos: that is what wrap around means yes
[04:59:50] <Deinos> ic
[04:59:51] <Cork> though like i said float, just loses persision
[05:00:18] <Deinos> thanks so at least I dont have to worry about it crashing due to its size, but would you know if it impedes execution time?
[05:00:24] <Cork> so 9999999900000 + 1 == 9999999900000
[05:00:49] <Cork> Deinos: the browser have to be memory safe or the browser will have an exploit
[05:01:09] <Cork> cause if you can overflow the memory you can run arbitrary code
[05:01:29] <Deinos> hehe sounds fun, Eval ftw
[05:01:36] <Cork> Deinos: i would recommend filing a bug to velocity
[05:01:51] <Cork> Deinos: that said why not just use css3 @key-frames?
[05:01:53] <Deinos> yeah I was thinking about doing that hm..
[05:01:59] <snover> Cork, Deinos, there is no negative overflow in IEEE-754, and thus no negative overflow in JavaScript. A value above MAX_VALUE is Infinity.
[05:02:09] <Deinos> cause after everything I read it's said to be actually slower than js
[05:02:18] <Cork> Deinos: it isn't
[05:02:31] <Cork> css3 is gpu accelerated, js won't ever be
[05:02:49] <Deinos> well if I can believe the interactive tests it is, at least in some ways
[05:03:24] <Cork> Deinos: well if you want js to catch situations
[05:03:37] <Cork> then ya, cause as js runs it has to hook into the async rending of the animation
[05:03:44] <Cork> there are work on adding an api for that
[05:03:48] <Cork> but there isn't one currently
[05:03:59] <Cork> but the animation in it self is quite a bit faster
[05:04:26] <Cork> especially on mobile devices
[05:05:39] <Deinos> you mean the css animation or the js one? sec im trying to find the test site
[05:06:04] <Cork> Deinos: the css one
[05:06:22] <Cork> Deinos: for js animation the browser has to freeze there rendering thread
[05:06:30] <Cork> start the js state machine
[05:06:33] <Cork> wait for it to exit
[05:06:41] <Cork> then loop over the entire dom to detect changes
[05:06:49] <Cork> and then render the result
[05:07:06] <Cork> it can't do ANY optimizations cause it has no clue what the js does
[05:07:19] <Cork> while css on the other hand is declarative
[05:07:29] <Cork> so it knows exactly what should happen 5 frames from now
[05:07:35] <Cork> and can prerender them
[05:07:48] <Cork> it also know what properties will change, and can optimize for that
[05:07:51] <Cork> it makes a big difference
[05:07:56] <PLG> Hi
[05:08:19] <Deinos> http://greensock.com/css-performance couldn't find the test but here it talks about css vs js performance
[05:08:37] <PLG> Please give me an example to calculate total and grand total
[05:08:47] <PLG> By function
[05:09:32] <Cork> Deinos: hmm well i have seen my self that power consumption goes down and animation smoothness goes up when css is used instead of js
[05:09:39] <Cork> Deinos: so he can clame what ever he wants
[05:09:56] <PLG> Cork:please help me
[05:10:09] <Cork> Deinos: and knowing what difference this makes for the rendering engine, and how the rendering engines work
[05:10:14] <Duikb00t> yo
[05:10:22] <Cork> makes me not trust that proclamation one bit
[05:10:46] <Cork> cause it really makes no sense
[05:11:52] <PLG> Please give me an example to calculate total and grand total using function
[05:11:57] <Deinos> hm ok, so lets say css is better ( which at least on this computer it seemed that way as well ). but can I do interactive transformations without restarting the animation on the first setting??
[05:12:00] <Duikb00t> Im looking for a tiles jquery plugin
[05:12:05] <Duikb00t> Someone who can help me with that?
[05:12:12] <Duikb00t> Ill make a sketch
[05:12:41] <Cork> Deinos: you can, though it depends on what you want to do
[05:13:02] <Cork> Deinos: and depending on what you want to do it might be different level of "hard"
[05:13:12] <Cork> also some cases just don't make sense
[05:13:23] <Deinos> turning wheels and at best link it to a slider to increase/decrease
[05:13:26] <Cork> but you still want to move as much of it to css as possible
[05:13:57] <Cork> Deinos: that would prob be best done in a canvas
[05:14:00] <Deinos> well I think most of it is css in any case cause otherwise how would they change the alignment of the div
[05:14:17] <Cork> as then you just draw pixels on a framebuffer (so it gets accelerated again)
[05:14:32] <Cork> alternatively you could use svg, it has the support
[05:14:38] <Duikb00t> http://i.imgur.com/pviaLkx.png
[05:14:43] <Cork> anyway gtg
[05:15:05] <Duikb00t> Im looking for something where for examle the left tile is 'active' where the title and text is shown when you click 1 of the other ones they 'switch' and the small one becomes the large one.
[05:15:16] <PLG> Please Help Please give me an example to calculate total and grand total  using function
[05:15:24] <Deinos> sooner or later i want to use svg anyway.. but I have to look up what exactly a canvas is compared to normal css transformation and how else svg is supported
[05:15:39] <Deinos> oky doky, thanks for the tips cork!

[08:39:16] <krambiorix> hi, how can i do this? https://jsfiddle.net/pxd1hwtw/
[08:41:36] <Cork> krambiorix: not sure what you mean
[08:41:43] <Cork> you mean you want to extend jquery?
[08:42:28] <taplar> looks like namespacing, though the second function is weird with it's 'this'
[08:43:57] <krambiorix> Cork, i want to call addAutocomplete on an element
[08:44:10] <krambiorix> so in addAutocomplete i can use $(this)
[08:44:34] <Cork> krambiorix: then you need to do $.fn.addAutocomplete = function() {}
[08:46:01] <krambiorix> Cork, should i put that out of my object?
[08:46:17] <Cork> krambiorix: no, you can't put it on your object
[08:46:27] <Cork> it needs to be on the jquery prototype
[08:46:32] <Cork> meaning $.fn
[08:47:02] <krambiorix> Cork, okay, i'll do that
[08:48:58] <krambiorix> Cork, how are such functions called? Prototype functions?
[08:49:09] <Cork> $().function
[08:49:16] <hellyeah> hey
[08:49:16] <Cork> that was exactly what you asked for...
[08:49:17] <hellyeah> what did i do wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/k9m0zf36/12/
[08:50:25] <krambiorix> Cork, no i mean , what's the name of such type of functions?
[08:50:37] <krambiorix> prototype functions?
[08:50:57] <Cork> you know what prototype is in js right?
[08:51:06] <krambiorix> Cork, yes
[08:51:24] <Cork> then you should know that that question doesn't really make much sense
[08:51:38] <Cork> prototype is just a special object on objects in js
[08:51:51] <hellyeah> Mark_____: hey can you take a look here what did i do wrong https://jsfiddle.net/k9m0zf36/13/
[08:51:53] <Cork> the function is just a normal function attached as a property on that object
[08:51:59] <Cork> the function in it self isn't special
[08:52:03] <krambiorix> Cork, ok
[08:52:40] <Mark_____> hellyeah:  since im not the greatest coder in this chatroom, you might wanna ask that question to someone else.
[08:52:40] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks!
[08:52:45] <Cork> np
[08:52:56] <hellyeah> :XD
[09:02:16] <taplar> hellyeah: what are you trying to do?
[09:02:19] <taplar> your trying to append body to your something element?  that makes no sense
[09:03:36] <taplar> and why are you surrounding html with a script tag?
[09:03:50] <hellyeah> well i did append wrong
[09:04:00] <hellyeah> i try to create a template for using later
[09:04:12] <hellyeah> i will create a template which has my design
[09:04:19] <hellyeah> all design
[09:04:28] <hellyeah> and create it over and over again
[09:04:35] <taplar> use the <template> tag
[09:04:37] <hellyeah> i heard there is a javascript template for that
[09:06:35] <hellyeah> taplar: should i add template to body instead https://jsfiddle.net/k9m0zf36/14/
[09:07:10] <Cork> taplar: <template> is too early it isn't cross browser

[09:07:56] <hellyeah> i bet it is not working in i.e
[09:07:58] <hellyeah> damn
[09:08:05] <taplar> apparently it works in ie edge 13
[09:08:20] <Cork> <script type="text/html"> is the best you can do for now
[09:08:23] <taplar> so *shrug*
[09:09:01] <Cork> taplar: also about the script tag around the html, i gave him that a few days ago :)
[09:09:12] <taplar> ah, never seen it before
[09:09:17] <taplar> just looked weird, heh
[09:09:20] <Cork> it is a common pattern if you don't want it to be parsed before you use it
[09:09:50] <hellyeah> why it didnt add to the body then https://jsfiddle.net/k9m0zf36/15/
[09:10:32] <taplar> say again what your trying to do
[09:10:37] <taplar> and then tell me what your logic is doing
[09:10:59] <hellyeah> i try to prepare a template for using later
[09:11:12] <hellyeah> this is what i try to do
[09:11:59] <hellyeah> my logic is there is a json coming from backend according to length of json array i need to create buttonsandcounters may be 10 may be 100 buttonsandcounter i will create
[09:12:12] <taplar> stop
[09:12:16] <hellyeah> okey
[09:12:19] <taplar> what is your logic doing
[09:12:22] <taplar> in that fiddle
[09:13:24] <taplar> Cork: with that pattern are children still selectable?
[09:13:39] <hellyeah> taplar: i have this https://jsfiddle.net/k9m0zf36/16/
[09:14:07] <Cork> taplar: it is just text :)
[09:14:08] <Cork> so no
[09:14:11] <taplar> k
[09:14:15] <Cork> you have to first parse it
[09:14:18] <Cork> $.parseHTML()
[09:14:19] <taplar> so hellyeah what is your logic goind
[09:14:24] <taplar> *doing
[09:14:42] <hellyeah> i have button and counters
[09:14:52] <taplar> what is your loop doing
[09:15:04] <hellyeah> well loop is kinda meaningless
[09:15:12] <taplar> ~_~
[09:15:16] <hellyeah> i just want to see i can create 5 elements
[09:15:29] <hellyeah> just try to learn template
[09:15:45] <taplar> ok, so Cork just said the contents of the script is just text
[09:15:51] <taplar> so how would you get that text
[09:16:14] <taplar> well you took the script out
[09:16:19] <taplar> need that back
[09:16:20] <hellyeah> parseHTML()?
[09:17:18] <Cork> taplar: if the script tag has ex id="template1"
[09:17:26] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/k9m0zf36/17/
[09:17:35] <taplar> i don't see script in /16
[09:17:38] <hellyeah> i put id there
[09:17:46] <Cork> taplar: you do  var template = $($.parseHTML($('#template1').html())
[09:17:55] <hellyeah> check here
[09:18:00] <taplar> ^
[09:18:01] * Cork wanders off again
[09:18:07] <taplar> so there ya go
[09:19:35] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/k9m0zf36/18/
[09:20:19] <hellyeah> typeof template object
[09:20:24] <hellyeah> what kind of object is it
[09:20:35] <taplar> looks like a basic object
[09:21:16] <taplar> so try appending it to the body
[09:23:10] <hellyeah> basic object
[09:23:18] <hellyeah> is there complicated object
[09:23:19] <hellyeah> ?
[09:23:38] <taplar> a function
[09:23:58] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/k9m0zf36/19/ nice
[09:23:59] <taplar> such as jQuery
[09:24:14] <hellyeah> prototype is basic object?
[09:24:39] <taplar> oh your going to get me lying
[09:24:43] * hellyeah wonder should i learn protoytype?
[09:24:52] <taplar> prototype is a property of an object I believe
[09:25:31] <hellyeah> taplar: i will try to finish my all studies
[09:25:35] <hellyeah> i asked my manager
[09:25:43] <hellyeah> is it your last requests?
[09:25:48] <taplar> huh?
[09:26:03] <hellyeah> i mean i asked something to you remember
[09:26:09] <hellyeah> and you said create mvp
[09:26:19] <taplar> yeah
[09:26:28] <hellyeah> well i asked my manager about his last requests
[09:26:40] <hellyeah> there is more or we just put everything together
[09:26:48] <hellyeah> he said we will finish js part
[09:26:58] <hellyeah> so there is two more requests
[09:27:07] <hellyeah> i finished one of them
[09:27:44] <hellyeah> here drop button onto another and drop button into created div http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/45/
[09:34:12] <taplar> there is one issue with that
[09:34:19] <taplar> your dropping buttons into a ul element
[09:35:01] <hellyeah> well
[09:35:26] <hellyeah> jquery ui sortable will allwo me to use sort capacity when you use with ul
[09:35:51] <hellyeah> https://jqueryui.com/sortable/ force me to use ul
[09:36:03] <hellyeah> may be there is a trick to handle that but i dont know
[09:36:11] <hellyeah> jquery ui has an example with ul
[09:36:27] <taplar> containing lis
[09:38:29] <hellyeah> lis?
[09:38:36] <hellyeah> what is list
[09:38:38] <hellyeah> ops
[09:38:39] <hellyeah> lis
[09:39:00] <taplar> <li>'s
[09:39:19] <hellyeah> yeah
[09:39:37] <hellyeah> <ul><li></li><li></li></ul>
[09:39:51] <hellyeah> this is the requirement as far as i understand
[09:40:08] <taplar> so drag buttons so that they are grouped together, and then inspect them
[09:41:12] <hellyeah> actually there muÄ±st be lis for every button
[09:41:19] <hellyeah> i couldnt do that
[09:41:37] <OakleafRanger09> Hi, I have a quick question about jquery-ui. We use it on our intranet, and recently installed a firewall that can block geo-ip. I noticed that many of the jquery-ui widgets stopped working. We have fixed this for now, but is there a way to localize this content? Just out of curiosity.
[09:42:06] <hellyeah> i will be right back
[09:42:21] <taplar> OakleafRanger09: are you using a CDN?
[09:43:07] <OakleafRanger09> No
[09:44:14] <taplar> you should be able to host the files locally
[09:44:15] <jeffreylevesque> what's a better solution, to dynamically create responsive menu's with jquery (building, rebuilding dom dynamically)?   Or, duplicating the menu, in the dom - basically, two sets of menu  in the DOM structure, and each displaying via css on different breakpoints?
[09:44:28] <OakleafRanger09> thanks
[09:45:13] <taplar> jeffreylevesque: same content?
[09:45:53] <Cork> OakleafRanger09: jquery-ui uses small .js files for the translation
[09:47:36] <jeffreylevesque> taplar: yes sir
[09:48:24] <taplar> imo, it would be better to have a single menu with media queries changing it's look for the different screen sizes
[10:23:12] <hellyeah> taplar: you still there?
[10:23:19] <taplar> who?
[10:23:20] <taplar> ;)
[10:23:42] <hellyeah> :XD it is you
[10:24:21] <hellyeah> when you drop two buttons into new div you need to surround with <li> how can i do that? Can you help me? http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/45/
[10:25:24] <taplar> your buttons are already in li's.  so you could get the closest li of that element and append that instead of just the li
[10:25:31] <taplar> or move your draggable anchor to the li
[10:28:45] <supsup> how do I use $.when with a variable amount of JSON calls?
[10:29:27] <taplar> i believe you have to use call
[10:29:49] <taplar> $.when.call($, argumentArray)
[10:30:08] <supsup> inside the array would be each getJson?
[10:30:17] <taplar> the promise/deferred, yeah
[10:30:32] <supsup> how would I then access the data from each call?
[10:30:39] <hellyeah> taplar: i am guessing you mean this http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/46/
[10:32:32] <taplar> supsup: you could attach a done() after that and reference the arguments for the number of results data elements
[10:33:04] <krambiorix> what am i doing wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/1tasbpqL/
[10:33:35] <supsup> i get the done part on the when with an array of deferreds but I don't get how I would access each data return value from each in the array in the done method
[10:33:40] <sigdk> hello. I am using DataTable to present my data as shown here: http://paste.debian.net/346838/  (note that I add an id to every row with fnRowCallback). In addition to that, I want to present extra info per device whenever a user clicks on some row. How can I fetch the "id" property per line inside the $('#devicesTable').on('click' ... ?
[10:34:03] <taplar> hellyeah: yeah something like that.  though the sortable is breaking the buttons out of the li's
[10:34:23] <hellyeah> supsup: dunno it is relevant but i wrote function once with a parameter and call this function inside when with this parameter. Thanks to this you can reach that data.
[10:34:42] <hellyeah> what do you mean "breaking" taplar
[10:34:44] <taplar> krambiorix: you can't stick an extension in an object like that
[10:34:54] <hellyeah> should i use sortable?
[10:35:10] <taplar> hellyeah: sortable is causing the buttons to be removed from their containing li element
[10:35:15] <taplar> for some reason
[10:35:28] <hellyeah> ic that yea
[10:35:33] <taplar> krambiorix: objects expect key:value pairs
[10:36:38] <krambiorix> taplar, how can i do it then?
[10:37:03] <hellyeah> taplar: any suggestion to solve that issue?
[10:37:43] <taplar> krambiorix: move it outside https://jsfiddle.net/1tasbpqL/1/
[10:38:06] <taplar> hellyeah: i'm not very familiar with sortable.
[10:38:14] <hellyeah> hm  okey
[10:38:18] <taplar> essentially you need to make the li's sortable, not the buttons
[10:38:25] <hellyeah> at least i can move button from a div to maindiv
[10:38:26] <krambiorix> taplar, thanks!
[10:38:32] <taplar> the buttons belong to the li's so they will sort with the lis
[10:38:35] <hellyeah> and it should stand in the same position
[10:40:56] <hellyeah> taplar: did you mean this line 46 http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/47/
[10:42:00] <taplar> hey!  dunno what you changed, but the sortable isn't breaking the html, :)
[10:42:36] <supsup> when you use the apply trick with when, how do you access the array of deferreds data in the done?
[10:42:49] <hellyeah> i just changed thiss   $( ".buttonClass" ).closest('li').draggable({ taplar
[10:42:59] <hellyeah> but this cause the issue
[10:43:06] <taplar> supsup: you'll have to use the 'arguments' variable
[10:43:10] <hellyeah> when you drag and drop second time it didnt work
[10:43:10] <supsup> ah
[10:43:11] <supsup> ok
[10:43:17] <logy> hello everyone. I made a login site with bootstrap. There is only place to type username, password and sign in button. I just want to make ONE  user no more. How can i make that if you press the button sign in it checks if username is "user1" and password is "mypassword"  and if it is correct it sends you to other part of website and if it is not then it doesnt do anything
[10:43:18] <supsup> so just arguments.length and use each one?
[10:43:29] <taplar> supsup: yes iirc
[10:43:39] <supsup> makes sense was wondering ...should of tried that
[10:43:42] <supsup> thanks taplar
[10:44:25] <hellyeah> i just have one problem it seems
[10:44:32] <taplar> logy: that's more validation that should happen on the backend
[10:44:59] <taplar> you don't want authentication validation on the frontend, ever
[10:44:59] <sigdk> ok... I have a table where every row (<tr>) has an id. How do I fetch the id of the row clicked inside $('#mytable').on('click', 'td.control', function() { ?
[10:45:25] <taplar> sigdk: $(this).closest('tr').prop('id')
[10:47:03] <krambiorix> How can i execute onReady? I thought it 'd go automatically? https://jsfiddle.net/mtxxvsev/
[10:47:09] <hellyeah> need to go
[10:47:20] <sigdk> taplar, this works... but why do I need the "closest" ?
[10:47:21] <hellyeah> i will be back in two hours
[10:47:24] <hellyeah> :XD
[10:47:41] <taplar> sigdk: since it's a td you could use parent().  i'm just in the habit of using closest()
[10:47:48] <taplar> a little less tightly coupled
[10:48:02] <sigdk> hmm... I see
[10:48:43] <taplar> krambiorix: i believe your thinking of the ready jQuery method which will execute when the document is ready
[10:49:03] <taplar> any ready that you make for an object is custom and will not be handled automatically
[10:49:36] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody ever have issues with waypoint events with plugins like this - http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/    creating the waypoint with an offset because the page starts scrolled down somewhere?
[10:49:36] <krambiorix> taplar, ow okay so i better call it
[10:49:40] <krambiorix> taplar, thanks!
[10:49:43] <Cork> krambiorix: so $(myobject.onReady); should work
[10:50:06] <logy> taplar: it is ok even for frontend i just need it for this ultra simple website. Do you maybe know an easiest way for that
[10:50:14] <Cork> krambiorix: note that this won't be myobject in that function after that though
[10:50:18] <taplar> no, it's never ok
[10:50:22] <taplar> ever ever ever, lol
[10:50:31] <taplar> authenticate on the backend
[10:54:00] <Cork> ya, if you do authentication on the frontend you could just as well skip the authentication
[10:54:26] <Cork> it would be like "if you don't have access to this content, please don't access it" :)
[10:54:38] <Cork> completely pointless from a security standpoint
[10:55:02] <taplar> let me look at the javascript...... ohhhhh, here is everyone's passwords.....hmm
[10:55:11] <Cork> ya, even worse
[10:56:06] <Cork> or a  $.ajax('/user_password', { username: "" }).done(function(password) {}) XD
[10:56:17] <taplar> heh
[10:56:52] <taplar> but it's over https!
[10:56:55] <taplar> no dude......no
[11:04:17] <krambiorix> Cork,  yes, thanks!
[11:14:18] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody ever have issues with this plugin? Starting to think it's uselessly broken - http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/
[11:20:43] <rfr> Hello, I was hoping to create a rule making the "address". To do so I figured I would make thishttp://jsfiddle.net/gatorreina/j3aury3b/ rule requiring that the input field contain at lease six characters. My problem is that that it keeps giving an error even if the inout field is between 7 and 299 characters. Thanks for any help.
[11:20:59] <rfr> adress=adress required
[11:28:39] <phpcoder> hello
[11:28:47] <phpcoder> can i do a fidd from two arrays of objects
[11:28:47] <phpcoder> ?
[11:28:59] <phpcoder> [obj1, obj2].diff(obj2)
[11:29:01] <phpcoder> ?
[11:49:24] <supsup> so I figured out how to do the variable amount of ajax calls with $.when.apply($, deferreds), can someone explain to me exactly how this works tho?
[11:50:26] <supsup> specifically how when/apply are working together
[11:54:22] <supsup> the array or arguments are the deffereds, the this is jQuery, how does that cause $.when to do a chain of "thens"?
[11:55:48] <supsup> would it have been better if when just took an array of defereds instead?
[11:56:09] <rfr> Botched the posting of this link earlier http://jsfiddle.net/gatorreina/j3aury3b/ I anyone can tell me what I am doing wrong I would greatley appreciate it. Thanks
[11:56:24] <rfr> I=if
[11:56:59] <robertmaxrees> rfr that's not a valid snippet fwiw.
[11:57:40] <supsup> robert you happen to know about the when.apply thing?
[11:57:48] <robertmaxrees> supsup what when.apply thing?
[11:58:00] <robertmaxrees> supsup do you have an array of deferreds you're working with?
[11:58:05] <supsup> yeah
[11:58:07] <supsup> i got it to work
[11:58:11] <supsup> but i want to know why it works
[11:58:20] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[11:58:33] <robertmaxrees> so $.when() usually takes a variable number of deferreds, right?
[11:58:37] <supsup> yeah
[11:58:47] <robertmaxrees> do you know what Array.prototype.apply() does?
[11:58:52] <supsup> yeah
[11:58:57] <robertmaxrees> so then why are you confused?
[11:59:26] <rfr> robertmaxrees: By invalid do you mean that it is defective?
[11:59:27] <supsup> guess i don't know it good enough ;-0
[11:59:41] <robertmaxrees> rfr as in it doesn't validate, as in you're missing characters.
[11:59:55] <supsup> why do we bind $ as this ?
[11:59:57] <robertmaxrees> supsup apply feeds that array as a set of arguments to a given function.
[12:00:00] <supsup> in the apply
[12:00:07] <robertmaxrees> supsup it's the first arg in .apply()
[12:00:12] <supsup> yeah
[12:00:16] <supsup> but why not null
[12:00:42] <supsup> will jquery not be in scope or something?
[12:01:00] <supsup> o
[12:01:01] <supsup> nm
[12:01:15] <supsup> yeah I obviously need to just refresh on apply.
[12:01:21] <supsup> thanks Robert
[12:02:38] <abishek> how to convert an object to query parameters in jquery. I tried using $.param but seem to be having an issue. http://jsbin.com/pibitiquye/edit?html,js,console
[12:02:51] <rfr> robertmaxrees: Thank you. I see what you mean.  I added the rest of it. http://jsfiddle.net/gatorreina/j3aury3b/1/
[12:04:36] <rfr> Any idea why it might be it might be continuing to give me "Please Enter a Valid Address" even when I input a string between 7 amd 299 characters?
[12:06:53] <robertmaxrees> supsup get the idea?
[12:07:03] <supsup> yeah
[12:07:16] <supsup> abishek:  looks like it workrs to me
[12:07:41] <supsup> thanks Robert ~~
[12:07:43] <robertmaxrees> abishek what do you want the URL to look loke?
[12:07:51] <robertmaxrees> rfr make a functioning fiddle.
[12:07:55] <abishek> any reason why the output of decode is `content_ids[]=144094`, shouldn't it be `content_ids=[144094]`
[12:07:56] <supsup> maybe he wants to use traditional flag
[12:08:33] <supsup> that is syntax for objects
[12:08:37] <supsup> not arrays
[12:08:40] <supsup> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.param/
[12:08:58] <supsup> or rather
[12:09:04] <supsup> i said that wrong but that page explains it ;-0
[12:09:21] <robertmaxrees> rfr http://jsfiddle.net/j3aury3b/3/ add your html.
[12:09:46] <abishek> supsup, robertmaxrees , so how do I output `content_ids=[144094]`
[12:10:12] <supsup> abishek what would happen if your array had more than one value in it
[12:12:09] <abishek> supsup, that wouldn't happen
[12:12:21] <robertmaxrees> then why use an array at all?
[12:12:45] <supsup> if you don't like the way it looks you can use the traditional view
[12:12:55] <supsup> $.param( myObject, true );
[12:13:11] <supsup> but it still won't be what  you said
[12:13:38] <supsup> it would be content_ids=144094
[12:14:01] <abishek> thats how the api requires it to be. the api wants the param to be `y[content_ids]=[144094]&y[content_type]=product`
[12:14:02] <supsup> seems like your key is misnamed if there can be only one also
[12:14:07] <abishek> am not sure how to arrive at that
[12:14:26] <robertmaxrees> that's terrible, but ok.  you need to custom develop that.
[12:14:27] <supsup> you have to parse it yourself then prob
[12:15:05] <abishek> thats how the new facebook pixel sends to their servers
[12:15:16] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[12:15:32] <robertmaxrees> so will your object only ever have one content id?
[12:15:37] <supsup> maybe it's that new GraphQL stuff...naw nm that is not facebook
[12:15:39] <abishek> yes
[12:17:13] <abishek> so the only way to do this using string manipulation?
[12:17:32] <robertmaxrees> abishek yep.  and take the square brackets off of the IDs - just make that a string.
[12:20:52] <arup_r> When used $(".status[data-user-id]") I am getting the element, but $(".status:data(user-id)") gives nothing..
[12:20:55] <arup_r> why so ?
[12:21:25] <robertmaxrees> arup_r do you have jquery ui installed?
[12:21:30] <arup_r> :data() is not part of Jquery core ?
[12:21:37] <arup_r> Ah.. no I don't have :)
[12:21:59] <robertmaxrees> nope.  and you shouldn't select using data attributes anyway - filter on them if need be.
[12:22:01] <arup_r> humm.. orange doc is indicating though, I missed it.. https://api.jqueryui.com/data-selector/ :)
[12:22:44] <arup_r> ok. May I know why ?
[12:22:58] <robertmaxrees> NO YOU CAN'T O.o
[12:23:13] <robertmaxrees> but seriously, data attributes aren't meant for selecting.
[12:23:34] <robertmaxrees> they're meant to store data.  methods like .filter() are a little quicker than alternatives and much clearer.
[12:23:41] <arup_r> ok.. I have lot of HTML having .status in a page... so used that way
[12:24:06] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:24:12] <robertmaxrees> then use better classes.
[12:25:05] <arup_r> you meant $(".status").filter('[data-user-id]') ?
[12:25:13] <robertmaxrees> no, use a function for .filter()
[12:25:26] <robertmaxrees> but really, don't use data attributes in this case.
[12:25:58] <arup_r> ok. I'll not . Thanks :)
[12:25:59] <rfr> Sorry for the delay http://jsfiddle.net/gatorreina/j3aury3b/4/
[12:32:47] <rfr> robertmaxrees: Now it seems to work. I'm not sure why, but I wouldn't want you to waste your time looking at it. Thanks
[12:37:08] <islalobo> Hello, we're trying to use waypoints in laravel framework following these instructions: http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/guides/getting-started/
[12:37:57] <islalobo> I keep getting "ReferenceError: notify is not defined notify('Basic waypoint triggered')" I've tried adding notify.js but without success
[12:38:24] <robertmaxrees> islalobo what happens when you add notify.js?
[12:39:04] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: nothing changes, I added the library to my /js folder and to the <head> and even tried moving it's position around
[12:39:24] <robertmaxrees> notify looks like a custom method - try using console.log() instead/
[12:39:52] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: console.log() works
[12:39:58] <robertmaxrees> islalobo then you're all set.
[12:41:01] <islalobo> I think I'm just cluing into to what you're saying. So in http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/guides/getting-started/ the notify() is just the same, as say, console.log() or alert()??
[12:41:23] <robertmaxrees> no.  notify looks like a custom library of some kind.
[12:42:04] <islalobo> Right, but all are trying to notify the user. And I could replace that function with anything else ex. http://drygiel.github.io/xPanel/
[12:42:13] <islalobo> (if I could locate xpanel.js)
[12:42:18] <robertmaxrees> you could use any function you wanted.
[12:42:47] <islalobo> Well, I feel like a big dummy
[12:43:02] <momomo> anyone knows if animationstart event can be applied on global element .. for isntance document .. i remember it used to work but the code is no longer working
[12:43:24] <robertmaxrees> momomo iirc that event bubbles, but i could be wrong.
[12:43:51] <islalobo> Is anyone familiar with waypoints js? I downloaded it looking for waypoints-xpanel.js but couldn't find it in the project
[12:44:00] <robertmaxrees> islalobo uh
[12:44:01] <islalobo> http://drygiel.github.io/xPanel/
[12:44:09] <robertmaxrees> islalobo what are you looking for
[12:44:09] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:44:21] <momomo> robertmaxrees, that's what I also remember .. i am certain of it .. but what the fuck has happened!?
[12:44:42] <robertmaxrees> momomo almost impossible for me to help if you don't supply code or any context.
[12:44:56] <robertmaxrees> islalobo download the expanel thing and look in the zip/tar
[12:45:42] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: I'm looking for <script src="/path/to/waypoints-xpanel.js"></script> I downloaded the xpanel thing, but it's not included
[12:45:48] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[12:46:18] <robertmaxrees> probably becauyse it's just xpanel.js now...
[12:47:17] <islalobo> ugh today is a dumb day
[12:47:23] <islalobo> Sorry for the dumb questions
[12:47:38] <Matt______> Hey guys
[12:47:52] <Matt______> I'm using a country plugin but it doesn't work with the latest jquery version
[12:48:08] <Matt______> does someone here have time to help me know which line of code breaks the plugin
[12:48:09] <Matt______> http://jsfiddle.net/master412160/zccehkvt/6/
[12:48:11] <momomo> robertmaxrees, yes, i guess
[12:48:23] <robertmaxrees> Matt______ uuuhh...
[12:48:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:48:41] <Matt______> I know its alot of code
[12:48:45] <Matt______> but its really an epic plugin
[12:48:51] <Matt______> I can link you to the github
[12:48:53] <robertmaxrees> kind of unreasonable.
[12:48:54] <Matt______> page of it
[12:49:11] <robertmaxrees> if you really want to fix it, learn how to read the trace.
[12:49:20] <Matt______> the trace?
[12:49:26] <Matt______> https://github.com/mrmarkfrench/country-select-js
[12:49:27] <robertmaxrees> the error in your console.
[12:49:32] <robertmaxrees> slow down duder.
[12:50:12] <robertmaxrees> also: you're not loading the plugin there.
[12:50:23] <robertmaxrees> oh derp you provided the source.
[12:50:36] <Matt______> yeah
[12:50:46] <Matt______> there an't that many CDN's
[12:50:51] <robertmaxrees> you're aware that the edge option isn't guaranteed to work, right?
[12:51:01] <robertmaxrees> and you can use rawgit to load files into fiddles from github.
[12:51:01] <supsup> random question:  any reason why $(this).data() would return an empty object? but doing $("#"+$(this).attr("id")).data() returns a full data object?
[12:51:17] <robertmaxrees> supsup are you repeating IDs?
[12:51:31] <supsup> you mean having more than one on a page?
[12:51:32] <Matt______> the problem is there is no real error but Uncaught TypeError: url.indexOf is not a function
[12:51:40] <supsup> perhaps I'll check
[12:51:42] <Matt______> well if I use an older version it won't work either
[12:51:44] <robertmaxrees> supsup correct.
[12:51:55] <robertmaxrees> Matt______ because you're not loading it into the fiddle correctly.
[12:51:55] <claytonzaugg> If I'm doing a countdown timer and would like to put each number inside of its own box, for example 12 hours 10 minutes 52 seconds, how could I put each digit in it's own box? | 1 | 2 | hours | 1 | 0 | minutes | 5 | 2 | seconds.
[12:52:08] <Matt______> ok
[12:52:13] <Matt______> lets try it out an other way
[12:52:21] <robertmaxrees> Matt______ use rawgit and load a stable version of jquery.
[12:52:45] <Matt______> 2.1.4?
[12:52:54] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[12:52:58] <sim642> I'm trying to use e.preventDefault() in a .on("submit", function(e){ but it's not stopping anything...
[12:53:07] <robertmaxrees> sim642 any console errors?
[12:53:14] <robertmaxrees> sim642 are you bound to the correct element?
[12:54:12] <sim642> no errors, it's the correct element because I was using "click" event before and the rest of it worked
[12:54:18] <sim642> not I just need the submit button to conditionally work
[12:54:29] <robertmaxrees> sim642 what element are you binding to?
[12:54:32] <robertmaxrees> the button or the form?
[12:56:07] <sim642> oh right, I have to use it on the form
[12:56:11] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:56:28] <sim642> it's so unintuitive that it has to get changed because I already coded everything in the event according to the button .click
[12:56:28] <Matt______> my main problem is that the dropdown doesn't show on my work board http://phpbb.miscy.net/ucp.php?mode=register
[12:56:59] <robertmaxrees> Matt______ where do i look for the dropdown?
[12:57:08] <robertmaxrees> linking me to a big page isn't helpful.
[12:57:13] <robertmaxrees> a standalone test case is.
[12:57:16] <Matt______> hit agree to terms
[12:57:24] <Matt______> and on the form its below Interests
[12:57:35] <robertmaxrees> the country dropdown?
[12:57:37] <Matt______> yes
[12:57:41] <Matt______> I got no clue
[12:57:45] <Matt______> I checked every class
[12:57:46] <robertmaxrees> you understand that's workin correctly, right?
[12:57:49] <robertmaxrees> you have a css issue.
[12:57:52] <Matt______> yes
[12:57:56] <Matt______> but that I can't figure out
[12:58:02] <Matt______> I try changing everything
[12:58:05] <Matt______> nothing works
[12:58:16] <robertmaxrees> it's a css problem.
[12:58:31] <Matt______> it works now http://jsfiddle.net/master412160/zccehkvt/8/
[12:58:35] <Matt______> yes
[12:58:37] <Matt______> I know that
[12:58:39] <Matt______> but like I said
[12:58:50] <Matt______> I tried changing any css rule for any of the classes
[12:59:12] <robertmaxrees> (i'm saying you need to go to #css)
[12:59:56] <Matt______> right man
[13:00:57] <claytonzaugg> Could someone help me find a good tutorial on countdown timers?  I'm trying to split digits up into separate boxes.  So 50 seconds would be | 5 | | 0 | but I'm having a heck of a time discovering how to do this.
[13:01:09] <Matt______> ohhh
[13:01:35] <robertmaxrees> claytonzaugg so try making it, show us what you have, and ask questions.
[13:01:53] <NoiseEee> (hint, use CSS to give you the "look" of the timer)
[13:01:59] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:04:17] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, here's the timer that I have now: https://gist.github.com/claytonzaugg/42af0d4491b05d2a4fb3
[13:04:25] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle duder.
[13:04:34] <claytonzaugg> Okay one sec
[13:04:52] <momomo> robertmaxrees, i made an example and figured out what I think the problem was
[13:04:52] <momomo> http://jsbin.com/hizoyopimu/1/edit?html,css,js,console,output
[13:05:22] <robertmaxrees> fwiw .on() has superceded .bind(), but ok.
[13:05:46] <momomo> the thing is that you need to use animation: in the css .. if the animation is triggered using "transition: all 1s ease-in-out 0s;" it won't fire
[13:05:58] <momomo> for simple animations
[13:06:15] <robertmaxrees> momomo right, there's no javascript event fired for CSS...
[13:06:40] <islalobo> what pastebin is preferred here?
[13:06:48] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle generally.
[13:07:23] <momomo> jsbin is better
[13:07:27] <robertmaxrees> i disagree ;)
[13:07:58] <momomo> jsfiddle takes forever to load
[13:08:04] <momomo> and tricky to update
[13:08:05] <robertmaxrees> not for me.
[13:08:08] <robertmaxrees> and not hard to update at all.
[13:08:12] <robertmaxrees> you click a button.  done.
[13:08:45] <momomo> CTRL + S doesnt work
[13:08:49] <momomo> click ?
[13:08:52] <robertmaxrees> does for me.
[13:08:55] <momomo> i don't do clicks
[13:09:12] <momomo> anyhow .. the animation start does fire depending on css
[13:09:43] <momomo> when I save in jsfiddle i get a popup to save the html page
[13:09:51] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[13:10:01] <momomo> chroem
[13:10:14] <robertmaxrees> it's always worked fine for me in pretty much every browser (shrug)
[13:10:45] <robertmaxrees> but hey people aren't allowed to have preferences on the internet soooo.
[13:13:19] <islalobo> I'm trying to run something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/83km6pdv/
[13:13:54] <islalobo> Goal is this: http://rawgit.com/drygiel/xPanel/master/examples/colorful.html (minus colorsâ€¦)
[13:14:04] <robertmaxrees> load waypoints and jquery into the fiddle yo.
[13:14:09] <momomo> robertmaxrees, you saw the first example .. it fired the event
[13:14:16] <momomo> but for this it doesn't : http://jsbin.com/yegidehusi/1/edit?html,css,js,console,output
[13:15:11] <robertmaxrees> dunno duder.
[13:16:23] <robertmaxrees> wonder if it's the keyframes that makes it work.
[13:16:43] <robertmaxrees> what are you relying on that event for?
[13:17:57] <islalobo> @robertmaxrees they are in the head, sorry.
[13:18:41] <robertmaxrees> islalobo there's no head in that fiddle, and that's not how you load resources into it.
[13:18:45] <islalobo> robertmaxrees:  how can I get an external library into jsfiddle?
[13:19:17] <robertmaxrees> load jquery by click the cog icon next to the "javascript" heading in that box and select it from the "frameworks & extensions" dropdown.
[13:19:29] <robertmaxrees> then load waypoints via the "external resources" on the left-hand side.
[13:19:29] <momomo> robertmaxrees, it is neccessary sometimes to trigger certain things, like next event
[13:19:41] <robertmaxrees> momomo call that logic directly instead.
[13:20:13] <momomo> i still have to know when the animation finishes
[13:21:15] <robertmaxrees> https://davidwalsh.name/css-animation-callback this guide should be helpful.  otherwise... dunno how to help you.
[13:23:17] <islalobo> robertmaxrees:  https://jsfiddle.net/83km6pdv/4/
[13:23:59] <robertmaxrees> you're not running that IIFE correctly fwiw.
[13:24:15] <islalobo> I don't know if I have ability to add xpanel.js
[13:24:15] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do with jQuery(function(jQuery){ ?
[13:25:01] <robertmaxrees> and you do - https://github.com/drygiel/xPanel is the repo and you use https://rawgit.com/ to get a proper link for it.
[13:27:02] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/83km6pdv/4/
[13:27:28] <robertmaxrees> need to hit "update"
[13:28:02] <islalobo> Opps! https://jsfiddle.net/83km6pdv/5/  The jQuery(function(jQuery){â€¦ was something that was suggested by a colleague/internet
[13:28:03] <robertmaxrees> and finally, what's up with jQuery(function(jQuery){})(jQuery); ?
[13:28:13] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:28:19] <robertmaxrees> you realize that's throwing an error, right?
[13:28:46] <robertmaxrees> (~graphetti@mailokc.c2ti.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[13:28:46] <robertmaxrees> [2015:12:15:10:27:03] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/83km6pdv/4/
[13:28:47] <robertmaxrees> [2015:12:15:10:27:28] <robertmaxrees>
[13:28:48] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[13:28:53] <robertmaxrees> jQuery(function(jQuery){})(jQuery); isn't valid.
[13:29:01] <robertmaxrees> jQuery(function(jQuery){}); is, but doesn't make any sense.
[13:31:56] <robertmaxrees> and something about that plugin seems off - i'm getting errors about it trying to register.
[13:32:23] <robertmaxrees> wonder if it not being touched in 2 years has to do with anything.
[13:36:18] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: I was wondering about that myself, honestlyâ€¦. I get this error: TypeError: $.waypoints is not a function and updated js https://jsfiddle.net/83km6pdv/7/
[13:37:12] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: <!-- $('.container-of-panels').waypoint('xpanel'); --> isn't how you comment out JS, and the error is coming out of the xpanel file itself.
[13:37:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/83km6pdv/9/ the error even happens here.
[13:40:00] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: Fair point. After removing the 'commented out' script I'm still getting an error: TypeError: $.waypoints is not a function return $.waypoints('extendFn', 'xpanel', function (opt) {â€¦ from xpanel.js
[13:40:09] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:40:20] <robertmaxrees> probably has something to do with xpanel.js being so old.
[13:40:27] <islalobo> Our ultimate aim is a type of parallax scroll. Are there perhaps more functional plugins that people would suggest?
[13:41:42] <robertmaxrees> http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/ ?
[13:49:40] <islalobo> robertmaxrees:  I saw that, but it's that we're hoping for the effect that is given by xpanels
[13:50:09] <islalobo> parallax.js places a fixed image before a div from how I understand it
[13:50:18] <robertmaxrees> so you want that fadeout effect?
[13:51:07] <robertmaxrees> you could fork xpanel and try to fix it or roll your own new thing.
[13:52:09] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: I saw examples of that when I was trying to debug xpanel. (it was my manage who suggested xpanel, not to pass the buck). I can fork it or go down a different route I saw maybe. But it's helpful that you pointed out where the error is coming from (or is most likely coming from)
[13:52:35] <robertmaxrees> err, that's where the error is coming from.
[13:52:45] <robertmaxrees> the error emits from that file even if you remove all of your code.
[13:57:39] <islalobo> robertmaxrees:  so another solution altogether then?
[13:57:45] <robertmaxrees> that's probably what i'd do.
[14:00:58] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: at least I can stop banging my head against that wall
[14:01:02] <islalobo> robertmaxrees++
[14:56:54] <_Noobie_> Can anyone help me with loading data from a .CSV file to an array to be used in an Angular application?
[14:57:44] <taplar> seems more like a backend language question
[14:59:56] <_Noobie_> taplar I figured since I was going to use jquery to parse the csv to array it would be the right place here to get help.
[15:01:14] <taplar> how are you going to read the file?
[15:01:31] * taplar is genuinely curious
[15:03:15] <islalobo1> I'm trying to get waypoints js to work: fiddle here https://jsfiddle.net/57xd5bsd/
[15:09:53] <_Noobie_> hi islalobo
[15:09:59] <islalobo> _Noobie_: hello
[15:10:17] <_Noobie_> Are you islalobo1 as well?
[15:10:36] <islalobo> Yea, I'm think sometimes my internet cuts out and I get a default name
[15:10:53] <_Noobie_> No biggie.  Just wanted to check.  So what issues are you having
[15:11:24] <islalobo> I am trying to get waypoints to work in jsfiddle so I can try to get the effect I want: https://jsfiddle.net/57xd5bsd/9/
[15:12:23] <islalobo> On my site the waypoint is triggering before the scroll. But in my jsfiddle it's just not triggering.
[15:12:39] <islalobo> Ultimately, I want one section to fade into another.
[15:14:52] <_Noobie_> I notice you don't have direction declared anywhere islalobo
[15:15:35] <islalobo> _Noobie_:  but if I remove that entirely and make is super basic: https://jsfiddle.net/57xd5bsd/15/
[15:20:17] <taplar> you here robertmaxrees?
[15:20:21] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:20:31] <taplar> what's that site that lets you cdn a github file?
[15:20:35] <robertmaxrees> rawgit
[15:20:39] <taplar> ty
[15:20:43] <robertmaxrees> islalobo https://github.com/imakewebthings/waypoints/blob/master/lib/jquery.waypoints.min.js you can't use this as the link.
[15:21:56] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/57xd5bsd/16/
[15:22:15] <taplar> so the errors are gone now atleast
[15:22:43] <islalobo> https://jsfiddle.net/57xd5bsd/17/
[15:23:21] <taplar> look at your console
[15:23:57] <islalobo> taplar: You mean in fiddle? I am looking at my console
[15:24:06] <taplar> so you see the error
[15:24:18] <islalobo> There's no error for me, no
[15:24:33] <taplar> about not giving an error to Waypoint?
[15:25:01] <taplar> err, element
[15:25:07] <islalobo> No, nothing appears. I'm looking at 'all'
[15:25:12] <robertmaxrees> "Error: No element option passed to Waypoint constructor"
[15:25:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm seeing that.
[15:25:30] <taplar> same
[15:26:07] <islalobo> Hrm, I don't get that on my local site. Don't see it in the fiddle
[15:26:13] <taplar> which is kind of interesting.  is jsfiddle now putting the html in the header?
[15:26:19] <taplar> err, javascript
[15:26:52] <taplar> sure is
[15:26:58] <taplar> didn't think it did that before
[15:27:21] <robertmaxrees> it defaults to onload iirc.
[15:27:23] <krambiorix> hi, how can i call an inline variable in my object function?
[15:27:29] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix do what now?
[15:27:37] <taplar> ah, it's an option
[15:27:42] <robertmaxrees> islalobo run your code in a document ready.
[15:27:55] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/57xd5bsd/19/
[15:28:02] <taplar> you can choose to put the js in the body
[15:28:04] <robertmaxrees> or do that.
[15:28:07] <taplar> it's an option in the javascript cog
[15:28:30] <robertmaxrees> aye, but showing people code-wise can be hekpful.
[15:28:32] <robertmaxrees> *helpful
[15:28:37] <taplar> yeah
[15:28:43] <robertmaxrees> especially in cases like this where they may not understand what that means or why it's important.
[15:29:09] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, in my html i have <script type="text/javascript">var a = 'blablabla';</script> From my jquery object function , i want to get the value of a
[15:29:20] <robertmaxrees> "my jquery object function"?
[15:29:33] <robertmaxrees> and assuming that's relaly what you have, you access a - that's going to be a global var.
[15:32:42] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/57xd5bsd/23/
[15:33:07] <robertmaxrees> you can shorten that to just $(function() { fwiw.
[15:33:54] <DarioLap> Hi, how to get elements parents that have a certain class?
[15:34:04] <robertmaxrees> .parents()
[15:34:05] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/84qug5km/
[15:34:19] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix look at your console duder.
[15:34:27] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: okay, I updated that. Thanks!
[15:35:11] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix need to include jquery.
[15:35:24] <islalobo> So now that my fiddle is working, I'm looking to understand why the waypoints isn't reacting as it's documentation describes it will react; that scrolling over the div, in this case 'whats-new', will trigger the alert
[15:35:34] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, yeah, just wanted to show my problem
[15:35:45] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix you don't have a problem - it functions fine.
[15:35:55] <taplar> yeah, i don't fully understand this waypoint thing.  it's executing the handler before scrolling to it.
[15:36:13] <DarioLap> robertmaxrees, parents but i want only that with a specific class
[15:36:15] <taplar> *before it's scrolled to
[15:36:27] <robertmaxrees> DarioLap parents() takes an optional selector.
[15:36:27] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, hmm
[15:36:53] <robertmaxrees> islalobo i might fix your markup first.
[15:37:14] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, ow i found the probl, thanks!
[15:37:41] <DarioLap> robertmaxrees, can i save into an array?
[15:37:56] <robertmaxrees> DarioLap an array or a jquery object?
[15:38:02] <robertmaxrees> because .parents() returns a jquery object.
[15:39:08] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: what part of it?
[15:39:11] <robertmaxrees> islalobo your css is messing with you here.
[15:39:19] <robertmaxrees> and you're repeating IDs in your html.
[15:39:37] <robertmaxrees> islalobo https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/57xd5bsd/26/
[15:40:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/57xd5bsd/27/
[15:40:10] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: oh, yeah, that's a bug I need to figure out. Each of these sections are pages we're loading on js
[15:40:17] <islalobo> Why is the css affecting me in that way?
[15:41:02] <robertmaxrees> you have a container that's floating.
[15:41:08] <robertmaxrees> and never clear it.
[15:42:17] <islalobo> robertmaxrees can I '++' you again? I'm going to find that containerâ€¦
[15:43:04] <robertmaxrees> just use bootstrap correctly and you'll be fine.
[15:43:09] <robertmaxrees> there's stuff about rows vs columns or whatever.
[15:49:33] <taplar> what does this button do...
[15:52:58] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: what was the container that was causing the issue?
[15:53:11] <robertmaxrees> one of the col-xs ones iirc.
[15:58:40] <_Noobie_> robertmaxrees have you ever dealt with reading a CSV file in and converting it to JSON?
[15:58:58] <robertmaxrees> _Noobie_ nope, but it shouldn't be too hard.
[15:59:33] <_Noobie_> I'm having the hardest time trying to figure out how to pass the url to the csv into javascript and then converting it.
[15:59:47] <robertmaxrees> so... the whole part?
[15:59:47] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:00:02] <robertmaxrees> the file needs to be available to a browser, for starters.
[16:00:13] <_Noobie_> well yes/no.  I'm taking that data and then sending the JSON into my angular app.
[16:00:25] <robertmaxrees> so what part do you need help with?
[16:01:05] <_Noobie_> I have that done.  I've got a small project created in WebStorm.  I have my basic index.html file and then a data folder with a CSV file in it.  I
[16:01:22] <robertmaxrees> i don't see a question >.> i'm lost.
[16:01:24] <_Noobie_> I've been looking at http://jsfiddle.net/sturtevant/AZFvQ/ but I can't find out how to send the URL for the file over.
[16:01:49] <robertmaxrees> you don't.  you need to grab that file and then call that function.
[16:02:48] <_Noobie_> Okay.  So I guess that's the part I need help with if you wouldn't mind.
[16:02:53] <robertmaxrees> ajax.
[16:02:56] <robertmaxrees> dun
[16:03:07] <_Noobie_> Okay.
[16:03:20] <logy> Hello everyone. I have a very very simple Login form. You just have to type password (no username) and press sign in, thats it. The password part is simple <input> in html. How can i make when someone visiting this types in password and if the pasword is correct it  will do something.
[16:03:45] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:03:57] <_Noobie_> lol
[16:04:03] <robertmaxrees> have them submit the form.
[16:04:11] <DarioLap> robertmaxrees, if in my parents i have a data-elem, can i get it doing $(this).parents('li').data('elem')?
[16:04:36] <robertmaxrees> DarioLap will it just be one parent element you're looking for?
[16:04:47] <logy> Yes for example you click the button SignIn and then it checks if the password is correct. If it is correct it sends you to other part of website.
[16:05:01] <robertmaxrees> logy do that in your backend.
[16:05:02] <DarioLap> no undefined parents (they can be from 0 to n, it's a tree)
[16:05:15] <robertmaxrees> DarioLap so .parents() will grab all parents that match that selector.
[16:05:42] <robertmaxrees> DarioLap so you need to figure out if you just need the closest one, or all of them at once.
[16:06:03] <DarioLap> robertmaxrees, i want in a array all data-elem of thees parents, can i do it in a simple mode?
[16:06:14] <robertmaxrees> sure, you want .map()
[16:06:46] <logy> robertmaxress: how can i use jquery to check the password that the user put. I dont know how to reffer (in jquery) to that password.
[16:07:12] <robertmaxrees> logy select the input an get its value.
[16:07:23] <DarioLap> thanks robertmaxrees now i try
[16:07:55] <robertmaxrees> DarioLap if you fully read the docs for .map(), you'll see how to convert the jquery object to an array.
[16:08:16] <logy> like i give input and id for example #input and use .value?
[16:08:35] <robertmaxrees> jquery uses .val()
[16:09:49] <logy> yes thats what i ment, thank you for help. Sorry i am noob in this, learning :) I am going to try this right away
[16:09:58] <robertmaxrees> check out learn.jquery.com
[16:10:00] <robertmaxrees> great primer.
[16:13:52] <_Noobie_> robertmaxrees This is what my code looks like so far, http://kopy.io/XUvp6.  When I run the console.log I get an undefined.  Any idea why?
[16:15:03] <robertmaxrees> are you using that csvtoarray function?>
[16:15:53] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody here know of a good and modern way to validate user input on keyup rather than form submit?
[16:16:02] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy use jquery validate.
[16:16:13] <_Noobie_> robertmaxrees yes, the CSV2JSON calls the CSVToArray function
[16:16:30] <robertmaxrees> _Noobie_ ah, you're right.
[16:16:42] <DeltaHeavy> Is there a way to do it that checks against the HTML5 validation? Seems like this new HTML5 API is next to useless
[16:16:57] <robertmaxrees> _Noobie_ oh, because $.ajax() immediately returns.
[16:17:06] <robertmaxrees> you need to do the console.log() in the success or done of the ajax call.
[16:17:16] <DeltaHeavy> Would rather avoid adding another 21KB to my site.
[16:17:24] <DeltaHeavy> Performance is a big issue.
[16:17:43] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't have any material impact if you're properly compressing, but okay.
[16:17:48] <robertmaxrees> then hand-roll something.
[16:18:07] <DeltaHeavy> Is it impossible to leverage the existing native validator?
[16:18:17] <_Noobie_> robertmaxrees thanks, now it returns an array
[16:18:34] <robertmaxrees> _Noobie_ it doesn't return that btw.
[16:18:38] <robertmaxrees> it's just printing it out.
[16:18:51] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy if perf is an iussue, what about browser support?
[16:19:05] <_Noobie_> yeah.  do i need to do a return before to make it return the array?
[16:19:11] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees Browser support for newer input field types isn't an issue.
[16:19:17] <robertmaxrees> _Noobie_ i just explained that you cannot do that.
[16:19:40] <robertmaxrees> _Noobie_ ajax is asynchronous - anything that relies on it needs to be called via the success or done
[16:20:16] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy .checkValidity(); on the element should work.
[16:20:24] <_Noobie_> robertmaxrees hmmm, okay.  Guess I'm going to have to rethink this.
[16:20:52] <robertmaxrees> _Noobie_ you could return the deferred out of getCSV and then attach a handler via done.
[16:21:29] <_Noobie_> robertmaxrees i hate to admit this but that was just a little over my head.
[16:21:32] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/d91cefce4530
[16:21:55] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees Thanks, this appears to be exactly what I was looking for. 25KB wouldn't be that much but if I can avoid it with this this is a far better option for many reasons IMO
[16:22:33] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy 2 things: 1) i wasn't clear that you were trying to leverage the html5 validation apis 2) "far better" is highly dependent ;)
[16:23:18] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees Assuming browser support isn't an issue I don't see a reason to use anything else unless you have some complex validation that needs to check multiple fields at once or something. And yeah, sorry if I wasn't too clear.
[16:23:38] <robertmaxrees> and that's the implication - browser support for most of us IS an issue - i have to support back to IE8.
[16:23:56] <robertmaxrees> and since you're using jquery, i think it's generally safe to assume people care about browser support.
[16:26:38] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees Sure sure, agree'd.
[16:26:50] <DeltaHeavy> Your first suggestion was in no means a poor one at all.
[16:26:58] <robertmaxrees> it's no big mang.
[16:27:01] <robertmaxrees> just sayin'
[16:27:08] <robertmaxrees> loooong day.
[16:31:40] <DeltaHeavy> np lol
[16:32:29] <_Noobie_> robertmaxrees is this what you were talking about? http://kopy.io/6y6cr
[16:32:39] <robertmaxrees> nop.
[16:32:47] <robertmaxrees> i showed you exacly what i meant earlier.
[16:33:07] <_Noobie_> Sorry, didn't realize that link was towards me.  I will look at it now.
[16:34:51] <robertmaxrees> so the first issue is you can't return out of an ajax call like that.
[16:35:32] <robertmaxrees> returning out of the function on the .done() call isn't returning the outer function.
[16:35:44] <_Noobie_> okay
[16:36:04] <robertmaxrees> but that wouldn't work anyway because ajax is async - the request is fired off and things keep going.
[16:36:17] <robertmaxrees> if you waited for the ajax call to finish, the browser would lock up.
[16:36:52] <robertmaxrees> so you have to tell it what to do when it's done.
[16:37:30] <_Noobie_> hence the return on the $.ajax({});
[16:37:53] <_Noobie_> Am I correct on that?
[16:37:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:38:17] <_Noobie_> oh okay.
[16:38:28] <robertmaxrees> so $.ajax() returns a jqXHR object.
[16:38:48] <robertmaxrees> so when you return that, you have an object that you can call .done(), .fail(), .then(), etc. on.
[16:39:03] <robertmaxrees> so you return the jqXHR out of that function, then chain .done() on that.
[16:40:36] <_Noobie_> Okay.  This is evidently over my head on what I now with javascript which is very little.  I'm just now starting to look at Angular.  I might have to pass on this idea.
[16:40:49] <robertmaxrees> i already fixed it for you.
[16:40:52] <robertmaxrees> ..>
[16:40:56] <robertmaxrees> you have an example that works.
[16:41:28] <robertmaxrees> it's a good thing to learn, too, since understanding promises is pretty relevant and important :)
[16:43:47] <_Noobie_> Yeah but when I take the data returned from the AJAX it doesn't iterate through it correctly in Angular.
[16:44:02] <robertmaxrees> because you aren't returning it.
[16:44:03] <dcherman> robertmaxrees: fwiw, i'd recommend using `.then` versus `.done` going forward so that you opt into standards compliant behavior
[16:44:11] <dcherman> .done and .fail are non-compliant for back compat
[16:44:55] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:44:57] <robertmaxrees> wut.
[16:45:05] <robertmaxrees> you mean forwards compat?
[16:46:18] <robertmaxrees> sorry, first i'm hearing somebody suggest that so i'm trying to understand the rationale.
[16:46:41] <dcherman> nope.  jquery promises predate the Promise A+ spec
[16:47:01] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what you're saying then.
[16:47:09] <dcherman> they've changed `.then` to be Promise/A+ compliant in jQuery 3.0, but .done and .fail maintain the existing behaviors i believe
[16:47:18] <dcherman> they behave differently regardling resolution
[16:47:19] <robertmaxrees> oh, right.  that i was aware of.
[16:47:35] <dcherman> well, more specifically when handlers are invoked versus resolution
[16:47:38] <robertmaxrees> but 3.0 isn't out yet, and getting people to understand promises as-is is very challenging.
[16:48:05] <dcherman> ya, but you may as well recommend `.then` so that they just use the correct method to begin with rather than having to refactor later
[16:48:18] <robertmaxrees> eh.
[16:48:27] <robertmaxrees> i think .then() can muddy the initial concept personally.
[16:49:15] <dcherman> other way around imo.  you cannot tell if `.done()` is synchronous or asynchronous without knowing how the promise is resolved
[16:49:22] <dcherman> with `.then`, you have deterministic behavior
[16:49:40] <robertmaxrees> great - try explaining that to something like _Noobie_ and have them understand :)
[16:49:49] <robertmaxrees> *somebody like
[16:50:00] <_Noobie_> I'm already lost in y'alls conversation.
[16:50:33] <_Noobie_> robertmaxrees I did want to let you know that I had missed 3 lines of code in what you initially sent me so that's why it wasn't doing what I wanted.
[16:51:23] <robertmaxrees> dcherman i'm not disagreeing that it's smarter to use .then() overall, just that i think the topic is very complex as is, so watering it down a little to begin with is helpful.
[16:54:20] <dcherman> robertmaxrees: sure, i just tend to think that the logical overhead of replacing `.then` versus `.done` is super minimal
[16:54:32] <dcherman> people don't need to understand the implementations to still do the right thing
[16:54:52] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:55:38] <dcherman> and actually since he mentioned Angular, I wouldn't even be using jquery there - i'd use $http most likely
[16:55:50] <dcherman> otherwise, i hope there's a $rootScope.$apply() somewhere in that code
[16:56:20] <krambiorix> why do i get jquery is not defined? https://jsfiddle.net/z779et3x/3/
[16:56:22] <robertmaxrees> in which case, he shouldn't even be here ;)
[16:56:25] <dcherman> or a $q.when() - both of which get complicated =P
[16:56:39] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix because you're loading jquery ui before jquery.
[16:56:45] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix load them using the dropdown.
[16:57:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z779et3x/4/ krambiorix
[16:59:44] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, thanks, in jsfiddle it works but not on my computer...aaargh
[17:00:05] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix what's the error locally?
[17:01:35] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, well on my computer i iterate through $(this) and that may be causing the error   elem.nodeName is undefined
[17:01:57] <robertmaxrees> how are you trying to do that?
[17:05:01] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, $(this).each(function(){.....});
[17:05:08] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:05:15] <robertmaxrees> what is $(this) in that context?
[17:06:09] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix and what are you doing inside of that function?
[17:06:12] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, for example $('.mydiv').find('.adddatepicker')
[17:07:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'd need to see if fail.
[17:09:59] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, just the code... :   https://jsfiddle.net/5spq504q/1/
[17:10:09] <DarioLap> robertmaxrees, if i have this html https://gist.github.com/anonymous/998ec9de18692954c14f and a click event on last li, how i can get all data-tag-id of parents?
[17:10:21] <robertmaxrees> DarioLap i told you earlier.
[17:10:25] <robertmaxrees> what are you lost on?
[17:11:42] <DarioLap> robertmaxrees, with this code, it get only 1 parent: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e88b9debf4da5c194169
[17:11:54] <robertmaxrees> few things.
[17:11:57] <robertmaxrees> first of all, use .data()
[17:12:08] <robertmaxrees> secong of all, you need to use .get() in there.
[17:13:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ta78tuvf/
[17:14:32] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, i pasted the code but it won't work in jsfiddle, just so you know :)
[17:14:52] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix because it's not valid code.

[17:15:02] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid thing in JS.
[17:15:14] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, just so you know the context

[17:16:44] <robertmaxrees> that's... not helpful.
[17:16:45] <cannap> xD
[17:16:58] <robertmaxrees> not sure how you expect me to help at this point.
[17:17:11] <robertmaxrees> check out the stack trace and look to see where you're passing bad data.
[17:17:12] <NoiseEee> good times
[17:17:35] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) wish i could help more.
[17:17:54] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees,  :D     can i do this: $(this).each(function(){...})  ?
[17:17:55] <DarioLap> Thanks robertmaxrees, but if i have event selector on a.delete-node ?
[17:18:09] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix are you asking permission?
[17:18:14] <taplar> lol
[17:18:34] <robertmaxrees> DarioLap huh?
[17:18:52] <DarioLap> my event is $('.delete-node').click
[17:18:58] <robertmaxrees> that's nopt an event.
[17:18:59] <robertmaxrees> that's a binding./
[17:19:39] <robertmaxrees> and what do you think would happen if you bound to that element instead?
[17:20:51] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, no, i just think it's not good code :D
[17:21:13] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix $(this).each()?
[17:21:18] <DarioLap> i have this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1d8d4ed1c72330eaa71a
[17:21:25] <robertmaxrees> okay - how else are you going to enumerate over the collection?
[17:21:27] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, yupsie
[17:21:36] <robertmaxrees> DarioLap the diffle duder.
[17:21:39] <robertmaxrees> *fiddle hahaha
[17:21:52] <robertmaxrees> DarioLap great way to play around andtest things.
[17:22:02] <cannap> what you want
[17:22:09] <taplar> baby i got it
[17:22:10] <cannap> what is with this map what your mapping
[17:22:25] <robertmaxrees> cannap he's got what he needs, just isn't testing the idea.
[17:23:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ta78tuvf/2/
[17:23:32] <robertmaxrees> and actually, then you can kill that stopPropagation call.
[17:38:53] <huck5> How can I disable an anchor (<a>) tag in jQueryMobile, similar to disabling a text-input like $("#myTextInput").textinput('disable'); ?
[17:41:34] <taplar> huck5: iirc you'd have to attach a click handler that cancels the event
[17:41:39] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:48:00] <huck5> taplar, so I could select it and .preventDefault(), or something?
[17:48:10] <huck5> Or, whatever the function would be for removing all clickHandlers?
[17:48:41] <taplar> $(selector).on('click', function(event){ event.preventDefault(); });
[17:48:47] <huck5> thank you, taplar
[17:49:31] <taplar> if you wanted to conditionally disable them you could do something like adding a class to it when you want it disabled and then
[17:49:50] <taplar> $(selector).on('click', function(event){ if ($(this).hasClass('cancel')) event.preventDefault(); });
[17:51:50] <robertmaxrees> huck5 there's a distinction between removing event handlers, stopping propagation, and preventing the default action.
[17:51:55] <huck5> Yep, that makes good sense. Thanks again!
[17:52:20] <huck5> Could you elaborate on why we would be using event.preventDefault() rather than removing the even handler completely?
[17:52:31] <robertmaxrees> because those are two different things.
[17:52:42] <robertmaxrees> what are you actuall trying to accomplish?
[17:53:11] <taplar> and as far as i'm aware the click handling of an anchor is hard coded, in a manner of speaking.
[17:53:38] <robertmaxrees> sort of - more that it doesn't use an event handler.
[17:53:45] <taplar> yeah
[18:06:42] <huck5> robertmaxrees, sorry, went afk. Right now my anchor has an inline onclick JavaScript function. I'm basically just trying to disable this - so that clicking the anchor does nothing.
[18:07:17] <huck5> Right now the function causes it to remove an associated text-input. I would like to be able to disable this functionality, based on some other conditions.
[18:07:35] <taplar> it's better to avoid inline bindings like that
[18:07:40] <taplar> bind with on() instead
[18:09:33] <huck5> taplar, system already in place.. can't change the core functionality. But I totally agree.
[18:10:08] <taplar> you could try removing it by setting the onclick on the low dom element to null
[18:10:37] <robertmaxrees> huck5 that would have been very relevant information up from.
[18:10:40] <robertmaxrees> *front
[18:10:55] <robertmaxrees> and onclick attributes iirc have to be killed manually.
[18:10:58] <robertmaxrees> but i could have that wrong.
[18:11:17] <huck5> OK! Sorry I didn't provide full information upfront. And thanks for your suggestions, they are much appreciated!
[18:12:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/22tuubvb/  seems to work
[18:14:35] <huck5> Brilliant! Thanks taplar!
[18:15:49] <taplar> i wonder if you can convert those...
[18:20:51] <taplar> heheh
[18:20:52] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/22tuubvb/1/
[18:21:38] <taplar> ugh, time to go play in traffic
[18:33:09] <daedeloth> quick question: will this do what I think it will do?
[18:33:10] <daedeloth> http://paste.ubuntu.com/14040357/
[18:33:19] <robertmaxrees> what do you think it will do?
[18:33:29] <daedeloth> (triggerEvents returns a promise; will done be called after the second promise is resolved?)
[18:33:59] <daedeloth> so, syncpLayerPool returns a promise, triggerEvent returns a promise
[18:34:08] <daedeloth> and promises need to be resolved in order :)
[18:34:12] <robertmaxrees> are these jquery promises?
[18:34:17] <daedeloth> yea
[18:34:18] <robertmaxrees> or actual promises?
[18:34:25] <daedeloth> jquery ones
[18:34:28] <robertmaxrees> okay.  then let's find out.
[18:34:33] <robertmaxrees> easy way to verify,
[18:34:37] <daedeloth> haven't started with that fancy new javascript yet
[18:36:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/w60ejjwg/
[18:36:07] <robertmaxrees> easy test case.
[18:37:09] <daedeloth> hm that's not the same case
[18:37:31] <robertmaxrees> you'
[18:37:47] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused by the return out of the then.
[18:38:57] <daedeloth> https://jsfiddle.net/w60ejjwg/1/
[18:39:08] <daedeloth> this is essentially what I'm doing :) but it does indeed some to work like I was hoping it would work
[18:39:23] <daedeloth> *seem to work
[18:39:24] <robertmaxrees> right, returning isn't doing what you think it's doing.
[18:39:44] <daedeloth> what do you mean?
[18:40:05] <robertmaxrees> woah that's weird.
[18:40:06] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[18:40:15] <daedeloth> just trying to chain async events
[19:57:46] <playpen> hey is const geolocation = ( not used in the sample, i don't see purpose for it https://tomchentw.github.io/react-google-maps/#basics/geolocation
[20:01:29] <robertmaxrees> something else might be using it?
[20:03:00] <playpen> well that's the full sample
[20:03:19] <robertmaxrees> who knows duder.
[20:03:39] <playpen> someone knowledgable ~
[20:04:00] <shoky> playpen: it's used
[20:04:11] <robertmaxrees> did you try downloading the example, removing that, and running it locally ooor...?
[21:04:08] <z1haze> if you change the src of am image with javascript, will the image update without refreshing the page
[21:04:54] <shoky> z1haze yes
[21:05:04] <z1haze> awesome
[22:25:28] <Croves> Why I can't do $('.class')[0].find() ?
[22:45:32] <arc_> my guess is because find expects you to pass a jquery object and $('.class')[0] passes an element of an array
[22:45:52] <arc_> regardless of that, it seems like you would be trying to find something within one element, which .. doesn't seem like it's probably what you really want
[23:31:51] <javascript995a> Howdy!
[23:32:04] <javascript995a> Anyone wanna make a real quick $10 for a short greasemonkey script? I can pay  via paypal
[23:45:13] <javascript995a> anyone alive?
[23:55:05] <Croves> javascript995a What kind of script?
[23:55:59] <javascript995a> Its for a runescape gambling site, Basically it will click a button and check a form ID for win if it won it will click the button again if it lost it will click another element and then the button until it wins
[23:56:36] <javascript995a> This is what a loss looks like and it displays
[23:56:37] <javascript995a> <span style="font-weight: bold" class="text-danger">lost</span>
[23:56:43] <javascript995a> Same thing for won
[23:56:48] <javascript995a> So it should be decently simple
[23:57:38] <Croves> Yes, indeed
[23:58:04] <javascript995a> Anyway I got $10 in it for you, Or if it turns out to be even more complicated you can take my whole balance at a whopping $14 :P
[23:58:30] <Croves> Sorry mate, I'm too busy trying to figure out why I can't print a simple alert() in my app
[23:58:35] <javascript995a> Lol all good
