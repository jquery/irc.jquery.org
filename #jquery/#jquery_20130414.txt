[00:21:13] <Mohsen_Hassani> How can I create a function in the ready() block of jquery so that the onClick="call_my_func()" get work?
[00:21:39] <Mohsen_Hassani> Do I have to do: function call_my_func() {} ?? This is not working.
[00:22:19] <tw2113> why are you trying to do it with onClick ?
[00:22:48] <tw2113> why not do $('.someclass').on('click',function(){ //do something here });
[00:22:50] <Mohsen_Hassani> tw2113, it's an image which should do some ajax when clicked.
[00:23:16] <Mohsen_Hassani> tw2113, I didn't know about this. Thanks! :) So this is the standard way?
[00:23:19] <tw2113> or define the function ahead of time and call that in the .on() instead of an anonymous function
[00:23:40] <tw2113> it's much more common and likely preferred than onClick in the markup
[00:23:43] <tw2113> ?on
[00:23:43] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:23:51] <Mohsen_Hassani> tw2113, Thanks! :)
[00:27:29] <Mohsen_Hassani> tw2113, There are so many images created dynamically with unique id. How can I access the id in the on('click function?
[00:27:44] <tw2113> ?attr
[00:27:44] <b-ot> tw2113: used for setting attributes on the HTML tag
[00:27:45] <bot-t> .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[00:28:01] <tw2113> coupled with $(this)
[00:28:16] <tw2113> which would hold the properties in context to what was clicked
[00:29:26] <Mohsen_Hassani> tw2113, Thanks again. :)
[00:41:20] <Mohsen_Hassani> Is there any difference between on('click', function() {}); and click(function(){}); ?
[00:47:54] <utterglee> gnarf, are you still here by any chance?
[00:48:04] <utterglee> sorry I had to leave...
[00:48:26] <utterglee> my question turned out to be quite long winded, so I put it up here: http://stackoverflow.com/q/15996579/443219

[00:58:25] <newcandy> Could/Would a third party rich-text-editor cache or store image information client-side? I'm using Redactor by Imperavi coupled with php. I just deleted all images and json files associated with them. But still the image browser in Redactor shows me images, and even lets me add them to my articles. Even tho the files arent there. It isnt re-uploading them as I add them either
[00:59:40] <sprezzatura> is there any example similar to the way github does the scrolling of the region when a file is chosen?
[01:02:09] <Gazpacho> yes, the github page code
[01:03:19] <sprezzatura> what are those called as? any specific names?
[01:05:47] <ravenzz> sprezzatura example url?
[01:05:57] <ravenzz> or screenshot
[01:06:11] <ravenzz> I don't know what you are talking about
[01:06:15] <sprezzatura> ravenzz: well, github ...click on any file on : https://github.com/unbit/uwsgi/
[01:06:45] <ravenzz> ok done, now what?
[01:07:07] <sprezzatura> click on any file..see the way the region moves and the new one fills in. very nifty
[01:07:28] <ravenzz> ..
[01:07:31] <ravenzz> what?
[01:07:49] <ravenzz> are you talking about the navigation's slide effect?
[01:09:02] <sprezzatura> ravenzz: yes
[01:09:54] <ravenzz> the content is loaded in ajax
[01:10:24] <ravenzz> and then you can animate the content or add a class with a css3 transition
[01:10:44] <ravenzz> also you shoul read about pushState if you are interested into the url thing
[01:11:02] <sprezzatura> ravenzz: how to achieve that animation?
[01:11:14] <sprezzatura> just the div moves or is there more to it?
[01:11:34] <ravenzz> I guess you can move the div
[01:11:48] <ravenzz> and set the parent's overflow property to hidden
[01:11:58] <ravenzz> so that it disappear behind it
[01:12:40] <futzhu> #web
[01:12:40] <sprezzatura> ok
[01:12:53] <ravenzz> or maybe you can just animate the width
[01:21:07] <sprezzatura> in this example, the change function is not triggered the very FIRST time : http://jsfiddle.net/a2Uh6/88/
[01:23:06] <sprezzatura> ravenzz: any quick help there?
[02:41:16] <spobat> why isn't the width attribute removed here? https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6559846/gasd.PNG
[02:41:56] <spobat> ah, I think it should be style, right?

[07:11:28] <anew> anyone know of one ?
[07:13:44] <Rahly> zth: the problem is, when its "hidden", you can't hover it
[07:18:44] <zth> Rahly, is there a way to dynamically change the css class of the iframe instead? then i could just use opacity set to 0 when hidden and set to 1 when hovered
[07:24:45] <drager> How can I remember position and size in a cookie from jquery ui draggable?
[07:25:35] <Rahly> zth: yes, you can use addClass, removeClass or toggleClass
[07:25:55] <Rahly> you could use animate to fade in/out too
[07:27:09] <Rahly> drager: sounds bad considering you will now be passing it back and forth from the server

[08:02:27] <innociv> I wonder why it's not working for me then
[08:02:34] <innociv> No 3d examples work in chrome for me. I tried some other pages
[08:03:06] <jrockjiggz> when i expand the frame, it skews in perspective: http://i.imgur.com/48efmwt.png
[08:03:16] <innociv> http://pastebin.com/atu1YTPd on chrome://gpu
[08:03:32] <jrockjiggz> innociv: maybe you need to enable them? visit: about:flags
[08:03:36] <innociv> That is how it should look in that case since the vanishing point is the center
[08:03:40] <innociv> It shows htem enabled
[08:04:12] <jrockjiggz> yea im not sure
[08:04:38] <jrockjiggz> im running: Chrome Version 26.0.1410.64 m
[08:04:45] <jrockjiggz> win7_64
[08:05:07] <innociv> Same
[08:06:04] <innociv> Not getting transitions on them either..
[08:07:57] <innociv> Or rather -webkit-transition:transform 800ms ease-out 0s, margin 200ms ease-out 0s; doesn't work but it works if I do -webkit-transition:all 800ms ease-out 0s;
[08:09:16] <innociv> Oh i forgot the -webkit in the property
[08:18:34] <zth> i have an object i'm showing on mouseover using show(), and then hiding again using hide(). can i make that object be hidden by default? right now it's visible right away

[08:28:36] <Guest15613> can anyone tell me that,  whats the cost  per year on web hosting ?
[08:32:25] <Rahly> depends on what you need for web hosting, and what your provider costs
[08:44:49] <F1skr> I'm trying to wrap my head around nested ajax operations and figure out when they are all finished. this is pseudo code of what I have so far: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5382971 basicly I wan't to do a callback when all ajax calls has finished, any idea how I can do that?
[08:58:20] <luto> Why doesn't jQuery.ajax parse the JSON ("Content-Type: application/json") returned by an HTTP-Request when the statuscode is 500?
[08:58:47] <luto> it works fine when it is 200.
[08:59:25] <luto> the text in responseText is fine, but it is just a string which I have to parse myself
[09:01:54] <gnarf> F1skr: since those happen in serial, you just need an else on line 29 to call your final callback yeah?
[09:02:41] <gnarf> also, do you really need two functions there? seems the first one is just doing the same as the second?
[09:03:38] <gnarf> luto: yeah, its a little annoying, but because it's an "error" code, it actually does NO parse on the response text
[09:03:52] <gnarf> luto: you could wire something up to force it though
[09:04:14] <luto> gnarf: well.. I'm just doing "var data = JSON.parse(resp.responseText);" now..
[09:04:35] <luto> thanks!
[09:04:43] <gnarf> luto: yeah, thats easiest, but you could proxy your $.ajax calls to .pipe your error through that
[09:04:50] <gnarf> so that the rest of your app can just expect json
[09:04:50] <abjorn> :( why aren't there any good breakfast taco places like
[09:04:52] <abjorn> a block away from me
[09:04:58] <abjorn> i don't wanna driiiive
[09:05:39] <luto> gnarf: ah, good idea. I'll read up on .pipe
[09:05:44] <luto> thanks :)
[09:05:45] <gnarf> like function doRequest( opts ) { return $.ajax(opts).pipe(null,function(responseText) { return $.Deferred().rejectWith( this, [ JSON.parse(responseText) ] ); }); }
[09:06:02] <gnarf> or whatever
[09:06:28] <gnarf> luto: just make sure you are using .done and .fail methods instead of "success" or "error" options
[09:07:19] <gnarf> abjorn: austin?
[09:07:25] <abjorn> yeah
[09:07:25] <abjorn> well
[09:07:27] <abjorn> pflugerville
[09:07:41] <abjorn> also, no one is serves breakfast tacos after 11 so
[09:07:46] <abjorn> except maybe torchys idk
[09:08:49] <Croves> Hello guys! Just a stupid question: why I can't do this? $(this).parents()[2].addClass('error');
[09:10:03] <luto> gnarf: yea, already doing that ;) it says that somewhere big and bold in the docs
[09:12:28] <F1skr> gnarf: they are called en serial, but the call is async, so I don't know when they finish, if I add else there it will just get to that before all the ajax calls has finished.
[09:13:23] <StephenS> how can I handle auto news update, but only after user clicked on my website /browser tab which leads to my website
[09:13:33] <gnarf> F1skr: um...
[09:13:35] <F1skr> gnarf: my two functions doesn't do that same thing in my actual code ;)
[09:13:49] <gnarf> F1skr: so the "else" there is the case when it DOESN'T start a new one
[09:13:58] <gnarf> so it just finished, but isn't starting a new one
[09:13:59] <gnarf> that is "all done" yeah?
[09:14:57] <gnarf> Croves: if you stuck around long enough, i would have told you to use ?eq
[09:14:59] <bot-t> Croves, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[09:15:25] <gnarf> I also would have suggested to use ?closest instead of .parents().eq(2) anyway ;)
[09:15:26] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[09:15:52] <StephenS> any ideas?
[09:16:43] <StephenS> maybe with focus?
[09:19:46] <F1skr> gnarf: you are right, because my pseudo example is wrong... this is kind a what my code look like: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5383280
[09:20:37] <gnarf> F1skr: so then that's not really serial yeah? its spawnning more requests from that each
[09:20:43] <gnarf> you wanna do something like this instead
[09:21:03] <gnarf> where you .map the links into things that return $.ajax
[09:21:16] <gnarf> `api jQuery.when
[09:21:16] <b-ot> gnarf: jQuery.when(): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually <a href="/category/deferred-object/">Deferred</a> objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[09:21:22] <gnarf> then you can do something like
[09:21:52] <gnarf> jQuery.when.apply( null, mapOfAjaxRequest ).done(function() { console.log( 'all done' ); });
[09:21:58] <gnarf> but like you're going super recursive there
[09:22:21] <F1skr> I have been trying that, but I don't know how many pages I have to look up ahead of time...
[09:22:27] <gnarf> so you might have to setup a var in an outer scope to track each request and decrement on each result, then call your callback at the end
[09:22:39] <gnarf> lemme gist an example
[09:24:08] <rideh> so using replaceWith() is not giving me the result i want when i call it on $.children
[09:25:28] <shoky> rideh what's the result you want?
[09:25:49] <gnarf> F1skr: https://gist.github.com/gnarf37/5ed0f776b4b9b0e0d77b
[09:25:51] <F1skr> gnarf: I have been working on that, the first function gives me a finite list I can work with, and then I just pass a callback all the way trough my chain and increment a global counter and check that agains't the size of the finite list. but at the moment it is not very flexible ;) I'll be happy to see an example
[09:26:28] <rideh> shoky: i'm using 1 select to retrieve options + populate a second select.  I want to replace all of the options, using this method however i get a set for every child that is there,, and it grows expotentially
[09:27:45] <F1skr> gnarf: thank you, I will take a look at that, I might return later ;)
[09:27:51] <shoky> rideh: $('#secondSelect').empty().append(newOptions)  is one way.. if i get you right
[09:27:54] <rideh> shoky: i want all chilren of select (all options) to get completely removed and replaced with a new list, this seems to insert a list for each child
[09:28:01] <rideh> shoky: sounds right
[09:28:04] <gnarf> F1skr: i might not be around, but be patient and I'll answer it ;)
[09:28:15] <F1skr> sure np
[09:29:23] <rideh> shoky: bingo
[09:31:22] <StephenS> what am I doing wrong http://jsfiddle.net/348dq/
[09:31:36] <StephenS> when I click on my website tab page inside browser, I don't fadeIn as I should
[09:33:04] <StephenS> rideh: no bingo for me though :D
[09:34:57] <StephenS> I tried as trigger to use $(document.body).focusin(function(){ } //not working..
[09:38:53] <shoky> StephenS: not sure what behaviour you're expecting.. focus is mostly for form elements
[09:39:12] <StephenS> shoky: I need on browser tab focus to do some logic
[09:40:01] <StephenS> You have in chrome opened youtube and myweb, when you click on youtube, in behind @ myweb is doing some logic, and when you click back on myweb tab inside chrome, you get displayed that logic (which was processed, while you were watching videos on youtube)
[09:40:03] <StephenS> for example..
[09:41:36] <StephenS> shoky: any idea?
[09:41:41] <shoky> StephenS: ok after 10 seconds of googling.. use $(window).focus()  or .blur()
[09:42:05] <StephenS> You can see I used window already
[09:42:22] <shoky> but not focus/blur
[09:42:22] <StephenS> In fact $([window, document])
[09:42:28] <StephenS> I used focusIn
[09:42:36] <shoky> that's neither focus nor blur..
[09:42:59] <rubenwardy> I have a problem with json.
[09:42:59] <rubenwardy> https://github.com/rubenwardy/castles/blob/master/assets/game/client.js#L23
[09:43:00] <rubenwardy> Originally I used jQuery.json to do this, but it did not work.
[09:43:00] <rubenwardy> Now I am using this plugin: https://github.com/jaubourg/jquery-jsonp
[09:43:00] <rubenwardy> which has an on fail call back. The problem is that it errors every time.
[09:43:00] <rubenwardy> this is the json file: https://github.com/rubenwardy/castles/blob/master/server/map/index.php#L6
[09:43:00] <rubenwardy> Is it my server, or something else?
[09:43:21] <StephenS> c/p :D
[09:43:31] <StephenS> shoky: aight, it works, but how about for focusOut then?
[09:43:47] <shoky> StephenS: dude..
[09:44:00] <shoky> StephenS: blur
[09:44:28] <StephenS> I know, but why I can't use focusI/O, is that only for forms?
[09:44:41] <shoky> because it doesn't work for window
[09:44:47] <gnarf> focusin and focusout are events generated when focus moves in and out of contained elements
[09:44:57] <gnarf> window focus/blur are different
[09:45:48] <StephenS> ok thanks
[09:54:16] <rubenwardy> thank you for helping :(
[09:55:51] <shoky> rubenwardy: that's not JSONP
[09:56:57] <shoky> rubenwardy:  your server has to support jsonp. outputting plain JSON won't work
[09:58:01] <rubenwardy> workS!!!!!!

[11:40:53] <defaultro> hey guys, really need your help badly. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. This is how I want it to look like, http://jsfiddle.net/35eVs/ but since I need to make it dynamic, I wrote this code but it's not showing the <li> properly, http://jsfiddle.net/QvYHL/1/
[11:48:20] <johnkpaul> defaultro: I haven't used jquery mobile much, but I'm pretty sure you need to wait for a custom event
[11:48:27] <johnkpaul> before you can run your code
[11:49:05] <johnkpaul> defaultro: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/docs/api/events.html
[11:50:25] <penguin1> I used on for listening on events of selected elements
[11:50:39] <codechewing> @defaultro - you're missing all the CSS style hooks
[11:50:42] <penguin1> the problem is that the container should listen to the events emitted by the selected events
[11:51:27] <defaultro> ?
[11:51:36] <defaultro> missing css style hooks?
[11:51:40] <codechewing> http://jsfiddle.net/QvYHL/2/
[11:51:43] <defaultro> k
[11:52:28] <defaultro> oh, why did it become longer?
[11:53:01] <codechewing> that's the actual markup used for http://jsfiddle.net/35eVs/ which is styled correctly
[11:53:22] <defaultro> why can't it detect what we have in the css?
[11:54:15] <defaultro> when it was manually written, the short <li> code worked. We just moved it out and it failed
[11:55:50] <codechewing> the scripts must have executed before you append the <li>s so it doesn't know to style them
[11:56:14] <defaultro> I have it in document ready
[11:57:04] <johnkpaul> codechewing: defaultro http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0/docs/lists/docs-lists.html I think you need to call "refresh" on the list
[11:57:18] <codechewing> yeah - so the scripts have loaded before, and not detected any <li>s
[11:57:34] <defaultro> looking johnkpaul
[11:58:05] <codechewing> @johnkpaul - that's what we're after!
[11:58:17] <johnkpaul> :) great
[11:58:27] <defaultro> trying it now
[11:58:29] <defaultro> $('#mylist').listview('refresh');
[11:58:31] <codechewing> do that inside the document ready after you've appended the list items defaultro
[11:58:56] <defaultro> it worked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[11:59:06] <defaultro> woohoooooo!!!!!!!!!
[11:59:13] <defaultro> so happy folks!!!! :D
[11:59:21] <johnkpaul> awesome
[11:59:26] <codechewing> (y)
[11:59:26] <defaultro> thanks to both of you especially to you john
[11:59:45] <defaultro> going back to eclipse now, hahaha :D

[12:08:27] <thomedy> what is it the google uses to make those sub menus in the searc
[12:15:40] <Zladivliba> can someone tell me what's wrong with that 2 lines of code : http://pastebin.com/XuhuGt5g
[12:15:43] <Zladivliba> I don't know why...
[12:15:46] <Zladivliba> I can't get the box to open / close
[12:15:59] <Zladivliba> i'm stucked with this shit...
[12:17:31] <carlosaraya> Zladivliba what are you trying to toggle?
[12:18:10] <Zladivliba> I'm just trying to open/ close the box when the user clicks on the input
[12:18:16] <Zladivliba> carlosaraya
[12:18:22] <carlosaraya> would help to see what the slideToggle() functions is
[12:19:51] <screamingbanshee> I fixed it for him
[12:20:51] <boze> is there any way to get the parent class of this one? $(this).attr("class") (like one div up?)
[12:21:01] <screamingbanshee> .parent()
[12:21:05] <carlosaraya> what did you do screamingbanshee? it looked to me like slideToggle wasn't complete
[12:21:06] <boze> <3
[12:21:39] <screamingbanshee> yeah I peeled the onwhatever out of the element and put the val() in the slideToggle callback
[12:22:04] <screamingbanshee> so they can see how to manipulate it within jQ
[12:22:15] <screamingbanshee> and cleaned it up for them
[12:22:42] <boze> does #jquery have a karma bot?

[12:22:56] <screamingbanshee> no idea ;) dawww
[12:33:42] <elrond255> does jquery 1.9.1 works with both touch and click events seamlessly or do I have to download query mobile? if I have to use query mobile how does it integrate with standard query events?
[12:34:57] <RSDRSDRSD> can someone please explain me why something like this.sendmessagesubmit.on('click',this.sendMessage.bind(this)); doesn work in ios with jquery?
[12:35:13] <RSDRSDRSD> is bind not supported on iOS
[12:36:08] <elrond255> as far as I can tell, iOS does't support click events, it's tap events and they are not the same
[12:36:46] <RSDRSDRSD> but there are no problems with bind() in iOS?
[12:36:49] <sacho_> are you sure?
[12:36:55] <sacho_> I thought it simulated click events
[12:37:01] <sacho_> or am I thinking of android
[12:37:16] <johnkpaul> elrond255: jquery 1.9.1 doesn't have touch events included
[12:37:21] <johnkpaul> elrond255: http://jgestures.codeplex.com/
[12:37:25] <elrond255> I haven't been able to get it to work with clicks‚Ä¶ looking whether query mobile will do what I need it to do
[12:37:35] <johnkpaul> RSDRSDRSD: Function.prototype.bind works fine, but just from that piece of code, I can't tell what is wrong
[12:37:47] <RSDRSDRSD> the code even breaks
[12:38:28] <RSDRSDRSD> in older browsers it also gives lots of js errors, while in new browsers it works like a charm
[12:38:33] <sacho_> elrond255, perhaps there's a gesture(like double tap?) that simulates clicks, or it's a browser option
[12:39:32] <johnkpaul> RSDRSDRSD: yes, bind is not present in all browsers
[12:39:38] <johnkpaul> ?g es5 shim @RSDRSDRSD

[12:39:46] <penguin1> I used on for listening on events of selected elements - the problem is that the container should listen to the events emitted by the selected events
[12:39:54] <penguin1> Can this be done?
[12:41:07] <RSDRSDRSD> should i just include that shim?
[12:41:56] <sacho> penguin1, look at on's documentation.
[12:50:30] <penguin1> sacho: events bubble up the dom tree from the emitter
[12:50:46] <penguin1> sacho: it is nice that those events bubble up from the children elements, but the parent should catch them, not the children
[12:52:17] <sacho> so place the listener on the parent
[12:53:54] <RSDRSDRSD> ok that shim works good

[13:05:38] <boze> I'm trying to animate marginLeft. Is there a way to set marginLeft: = 100%; instead of +=? I want it to go left and right
[13:06:07] <boze> the number is a variable
[13:09:28] <danheberden> boze: you can just set it to 100%?
[13:09:43] <danheberden> css('marginLeft', '100%')?
[13:09:51] * boze tries that
[13:10:13] <danheberden> or animate it using css3 and make a class like .animate { margin-left: 100%; } and just `.addClass('animate')`

[14:46:53] <kosibar> Is there a particularly good guide for switching from Prototype to jQuery?
[14:50:16] <Gazpacho> what do you want to switch and why
[14:50:41] <Gazpacho> really, the jquery docs are pretty good
[14:51:32] <Gazpacho> however jquery does not have anything to replace prototype's object model
[14:52:20] <kosibar> I want to switch everything because "Prototype is dead" and I'd like to start using jQuery instead. All of my own tools that I've built, though, use Prototype.
[14:52:25] <kosibar> Rather heavily in some cases.
[14:57:32] <vanseverk> Hi, anyone here who can help me with a jscrollpane issue?
[15:02:27] <bsdbofh> Hey all, I'm trying to figure out a way to keep a page free of vertical scrolling. I dunno, maybe I'm making this too complicated? http://jsfiddle.net/GjnY4/3/
[15:04:50] <kosibar> bsdbofh: What's the - 200?
[15:05:15] <bsdbofh> kosibar, just testing to see if I could get it to stop 200px before the end. I've been trying different things.
[15:06:02] <bsdbofh> just testing to see if anything worked.
[15:06:52] <bsdbofh> basically, I'm just trying to get the board there to stop before that footer content. for some reason it just keeps on going behind it though.
[15:11:17] <kosibar> You're manually setting the height of .task-list to 700?
[15:14:43] <bsdbofh> kosibar, yeah, if I don't manually set a long height of .task-list, and the task list has no divs that get populated, then they won't show up at all.
[15:15:05] <bsdbofh> again, if there's a better solution, i'm all about it. I just can't seem to find one. heh
[15:19:01] <kosibar> I'm guessing that that's where your problems lie. Perhaps, the way you've set this up, you'll need to adjust the height of the .task-list elements as well.
[15:19:57] <bsdbofh> hmm

[17:19:58] <brrc> Hello everyone, to talk about ui plugins should i go to the jqueryui dev channel or can I just prompt here ?
[17:22:41] <vladikoff> brrc, prompt here
[17:26:44] <brrc> ok thank you, I'm having a glitch using jquery 1.7.1 and jquery-ui 1.8.23 with no css but the default ui one, I'm using .sortable() and when I mouseover an <li> item (notice the the is an <ul> <li> structure inside the sorted <li>) the item goes a top:63px; have no idea why, and that  doesn't allways happen and not on evry item.
[17:27:01] <brrc> Thank you in advance for the help, and sorry about the poor english.
[17:44:53] <Tyraziel> Ok, so I'm trying to wrap my head around deferred.  What I have is an AJAX call that returns a bunch of data, that I need to populate a table with.  This works fine, but I was trying to add in a nifty loading spinner to show some movement on the page.  However in my success callback in my ajax I call a "putDataInTable(data)" method which takes a majority of the time, and actually causes the browser to "hang" for a bit.  I was tryin
[17:47:06] <sacho> you were tryin?
[17:47:32] <Tyraziel> yes‚Ä¶ it seems that it wasn't working as i expected it to
[17:47:49] <sacho> ok.
[17:48:32] <Tyraziel> i basically want the "putDataInTable" to be an asynchronous call, so the web page doesn't "lock up" for a few seconds
[17:50:19] <sacho> and what does it do?
[17:51:02] <Tyraziel> the same exact thing as if i don't use deferred
[17:51:15] <Tyraziel> but I think i'm using deferred wrong‚Ä¶ which would be the case.
[17:51:50] <MoeLouban> why dont you load your spinner first and have it removed when the page is done loading?
[17:52:23] <Tyraziel> it's not the page entirely‚Ä¶ it's a table in the page‚Ä¶ and I start the spinner right away, but it hangs until the loading is done
[17:52:32] <sacho> I think you misunderstand what deferred does.
[17:52:44] <shoky> doesn't sound like deferreds would help.. if you're doing work in your function, it'll hang the page until you return from your event handler.. unless you use web workers or smth
[17:52:48] <sacho> Deferred is a way to synchronize a chain of async calls
[17:53:18] <Tyraziel> ah so i am using it wrong
[17:53:22] <shoky> sounds more like you want to optimize whatever it is you're doing that's taking so long
[17:53:49] <sacho> if the page is freezing, you must be doing heavy processing.
[17:53:57] <shoky> and that's why sacho asked "what does it do?", probably. as in, what's the work you're doing in that function?
[17:54:17] <Tyraziel> it's loading data into a table, and increasing the size of the table as needed
[17:54:37] <shoky> that's very vague
[17:55:35] <Tyraziel> It initializes a table of a starting size.  then I iterate over a json array that contains data, which includes row / column information for where the data is expected to go.
[17:55:35] <brrc> shoky: hello once more :)
[17:55:44] <shoky> hiya brrc
[17:55:56] <Tyraziel> if the table isn't big enough, i expand the table
[17:56:00] <shoky> you're appending one row at a time?
[17:56:06] <brrc> I have a question for you guys, but will wait until the current one is finished.
[17:56:18] <shoky> what does "expand the table" mean...
[17:56:26] <Tyraziel> say the table has 10 rows, and the data is suppose to be in row 20
[17:56:33] <shoky> ah
[17:56:33] <Tyraziel> i add 10 rows to the table
[17:56:52] <shoky> how many rows~ are we talking about
[17:56:57] <Tyraziel> less than 100
[17:57:04] <shoky> wut.
[17:57:06] <Tyraziel> probably around 10 ‚àí 20
[17:57:10] <shoky> pastebin your code dude
[17:57:24] <Tyraziel> yeah‚Ä¶i think i see what's going on‚Ä¶. but the question really is how to make an async call
[17:57:44] <sacho> For such small numbers you should focus on optimizing your code
[17:57:50] <Tyraziel> if that's not possible and i need to use worker threads, then i'll have to investigate that
[17:58:07] <Tyraziel> yeah i see something i could optimize
[17:58:22] <shoky> worker thread for adding 100 rows to a table sounds like mega overkill
[17:58:47] <shoky> actually donno if that'd even help for 10000
[18:00:05] <Tyraziel> I think i know what's causing it to take a while‚Ä¶ i do some removal and then re-adding of some event handlers on the tds for all the tds in the table
[18:00:26] <shoky> read about event delegation
[18:00:27] <shoky> ?on
[18:00:28] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:02:17] <shoky> with delegation you wont have to remove/add event handlers for new rows
[18:02:27] <sacho> unless you have something like 1000 columns..
[18:02:51] <sacho> event delegation saves lives!
[18:03:01] <Tyraziel> interesting on the delegation.  that would make things much simpler too.
[18:03:19] <defaultro> hey guys, is it possible to convert a jquery-mobile to an adroid app?
[18:04:05] <JoseffB> hey all
[18:04:18] <JoseffB> anyone really good a DOM available to help me fix a find and replace
[18:04:46] <shoky> brrc: i saw your question.. you should give a link/demo
[18:05:08] <Treeson> when I return a call to get the background image ((var sprite = $('body .card').css('background-image'); alert(sprite);)) it is giving me back the entire url starting from http://.  I just want to get the url from the css page.  Is there any way to get around this?
[18:05:24] <brrc> this time, no link only the bits of code and a screenshot, will arranje that in a sec
[18:07:59] <JoseffB> Can anyone help me with this clone/find/replace statement http://pastebin.com/yUAj4zxn
[18:08:11] <sacho> Treeson, replace the url part with what you need from the location
[18:08:21] <JoseffB> everything works except the replace
[18:10:55] <Treeson> sacho: not sure what you mean
[18:11:24] <Gazpacho> you're passing a function to clone?
[18:11:54] <sacho> which part
[18:13:52] <Gazpacho> where is clone allowed to take a function argument?
[18:14:32] <sacho> nowhere
[18:14:42] <Treeson> sacho: I understand, I am just not sure why jQuery doesn't swap the url exactly: for example in my css I have url(../images/sprite.png) and now I have to have url(mainFolder/images/sprite.png
[18:14:43] <Gazpacho> don't pm me
[18:14:56] <JoseffB> sry
[18:15:26] <shoky> Treeson: jquery gives you what the browser gives it
[18:16:36] <sacho> urls are all normalized
[18:16:54] <Treeson> understood
[18:18:52] <Treeson> all I had to do was take out the ../
[18:19:04] <sacho> congrats.
[18:19:11] <Treeson> ty (bows)
[18:22:39] <Tyraziel> oh ‚Äî sacho / shoky thanks for the help
[18:30:35] <brrc> shoky that only happens when i scrolled a bit down, if I stay n top works well. and gradally increases as i scroll down. is it fixed position?
[18:32:23] <shoky> brrc: i don't know.. but you might want to try with the latest jquery & jquery-ui .. many bugs have been fixed since, maybe this issue too (if its a bug)
[18:32:48] <brrc> ok, thank you :)
[18:32:51] <brrc> once more
[18:33:03] <brrc> will try

[19:18:36] <JoseffB> hey in regex how do I say replace(/0/,number)
[19:18:47] <JoseffB> are there " around 0
[19:18:58] <coldhead> no
[19:19:00] <coldhead> regex literal
[19:19:03] <coldhead> doesn't need quotes
[19:19:08] <coldhead> js knows /thing/ is a regex
[19:19:12] <coldhead> it's one of the Good Parts
[19:19:21] <JoseffB> so just /0/
[19:19:45] <coldhead> sure
[19:20:05] <coldhead> although if you're just replacing a literal '0'
[19:20:05] <JoseffB> any one want to check my function to see whats wrong with it?
[19:20:08] <coldhead> you don't need a regex
[19:20:16] <coldhead> .replace('0', 'aids')
[19:20:21] <coldhead> is ostensibly faster
[19:20:32] <JoseffB> yeah that seems fine but my find is screwed up then
[19:21:13] <coldhead> i'm looking now

[19:22:34] <coldhead> you could have gone FOR ME
[19:22:39] <coldhead> esp. with @jessicard there
[19:22:49] <coldhead> i am such a sad not to hang out with that awesome retard
[19:22:59] <abjorn> lol
[19:23:02] <abjorn> WELL HAD I KNOWN
[19:23:31] <JoseffB> maybe I need a regex that says 0 inbetween stuff
[19:23:54] <JoseffB>  i.e. condition[0][type]
[19:24:11] <coldhead> JoseffB: $('destinationWrapper') should be $(destinationWrapper)
[19:24:21] <coldhead> you want the value of the var, not the string 'destinationWrapper''
[19:24:38] <JoseffB> yea found that right after as well as id in second each should be name
[19:24:46] <JoseffB> still only duplicates but no id change
[19:25:47] <coldhead> JoseffB: http://jsfiddle.net/jYTyw/
[19:25:57] <coldhead> i would try some console.log()s like so to see what's going on
[19:26:10] <JoseffB> nothing is written to log
[19:26:32] <coldhead> so the code is not even running?
[19:26:41] <coldhead> can you possibly make an actual working demo on jsfiddle?
[19:26:47] <coldhead> i tried but your code is missing stuff
[19:26:55] <coldhead> then i got bored
[19:26:59] <coldhead> then maggie laughed
[19:27:03] <coldhead> she's such a little trooper
[19:27:27] <coldhead> this later version with .attr() rather than [0] makes me happy
[19:28:15] <JoseffB> just add a link named within a div named new_condition_nt
[19:28:27] <JoseffB> new_condition_btn
[19:28:38] <coldhead> you do it
[19:29:12] <JoseffB> <div id="new_condition_btn"><a href=#>hi</a></div>
[19:31:42] <tw2113> how do i jqueries?
[19:38:03] <coldhead> JoseffB: i don't... even...
[19:38:05] <coldhead> i mean
[19:38:10] <coldhead> your code seems to find the children of q
[19:38:16] <coldhead> and then changes all their IDs
[19:38:22] <coldhead> but none of the children have IDs
[19:38:26] <coldhead> so... i don't even
[19:38:26] <JoseffB> coldhead -- its actually working on the select, but skips the fist
[19:38:31] <JoseffB> its supposed to
[19:38:54] <JoseffB> it duplicated the form rows and changes the names
[19:39:03] <JoseffB> but its skipping hte first one
[19:39:56] <JoseffB> sorta works now I need to have it change the primary id
[19:46:11] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/jYTyw/1/
[19:47:34] <JoseffB> coldhead: sweet, thanks!
[19:48:04] <JoseffB> I'll post up the final function for your records, incase you ever want to duplicatte a form record
[19:48:31] <coldhead> i use templates when i need to do that
[19:48:41] <coldhead> actual templates, not this messy clone() stuff

[19:50:00] <JoseffB> thats pretty cool
[19:51:34] <BabySuperman> how do I create a custom event? i.e., I want a special event after my submit() event on my form is done
[19:53:29] <epicurus> a special event? like in the special olympics?
[19:54:55] <MickRip> BabySuperman: $("form_id").submit(function(){ // do shit here }}); ?
[19:55:10] <MickRip> without the error
[19:55:15] <BabySuperman> MickRip, I already have some submit stuff for all my forms on my site
[19:55:28] <BabySuperman> MickRip, Some forms need EXTRA stuff, I just created "submitdone" event and am using trigger, thanks!
[19:56:13] <MickRip> BabySuperman: is it the same trigger for every form?
[19:56:31] <BabySuperman> MickRip, no
[19:58:28] <MickRip> BabySuperman: I remember creating a quick jquery pluggin for when I had a lot of forms with pre and post submit behaviours. Felt clean
[19:59:02] <BabySuperman> MickRip, ?

[20:23:01] <overrider> Is there a plugin out there that creates a simple gallery from a set of folders with images? So folders are categories basically, click on one, it lists all the contents.
[20:49:23] <defaultro> anyone knows how to prepare a jquery-mobile web app for phonegap? I've been searching for almost an hour now but still couldn't find a decent step by step tutorial
[21:03:36] <rebel_yell> is there anyway to send javascript with a link
[21:03:37] <rebel_yell> http://milo.com/product/3425810
[21:03:43] <rebel_yell> see the locate me buton
[21:03:54] <rebel_yell> i want for a user to click that link on my page
[21:04:09] <rebel_yell> and then when he gets to the page javascript to click the locate me button
[21:05:42] <rebel_yell> is it possible?
[21:11:22] <rebel_yell> ???
[21:15:42] <Foxhoundz> no.
[21:16:26] <Foxhoundz> What I hear you saying is, you want to include javascript code on a link that is executed on the target's page, right?
[21:18:34] <rebel_yell> Foxhoundz:  correct
[21:19:50] <Foxhoundz> Unless you use greasemonkey/content scripts, I don't see how that's possible
[21:20:09] <tdignan> what if you stuck it in an iframe and did it that way
[21:21:00] <Foxhoundz> you could also do something like bookmarklets, which work like content scripts, injecting JavaScript in the current page the user is on when the bookmark is clicked
[21:22:12] <Foxhoundz> there are safeguards put in place to prevent cross site scripting to avoid forgery and general malicious behavior
[21:42:15] <madprops> hi
[21:43:22] <madprops> i'm trying to scroll to the bottom of a div using $('#mydiv').scrollTop($('#mydiv').height()) but sometimes it doesn't go all the way down. Am I doing something wrong?
[21:53:31] <Zavior> will the query decedent selector travel down frames as well?
[21:53:46] <veQue> any reason show and hide are not working?
[21:54:04] <coldhead> they've been deprecated
[21:54:28] <veQue> oh?
[21:54:34] <veQue> crud
[21:54:36] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[21:54:44] <coldhead> no show and hide are still good to go
[21:55:23] <MoeLouban> lol
[21:57:31] <veQue> coldhead: thanks
[21:57:38] <veQue> just got it to work
[21:57:47] <coldhead> bad selectors?
[21:57:55] <veQue> was plugging into wrong function
[21:58:00] <coldhead> whoops!
[21:58:06] <veQue> yep
[21:58:33] <veQue> well while i'm here
[21:59:03] <veQue> ..

[22:34:56] <khaan> hi everybody. Which is the cleanest and most simple way to have n different elements appearing one after another with fade in a page?
[22:35:52] <coldhead> khaan: http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[22:37:12] <khaan> coldhead: cool. Suppose i have the divs and the classes of the elements, how could i say for example: "load first id1, then classA, and id3" and so on? :)
[22:37:27] <khaan> those are NOT one into another
[22:37:52] <coldhead> i'm not sure, i'd need to see some code
[22:38:03] <coldhead> NO ONE EVER REALLY UNDERSTANDS
[22:38:53] <khaan> ok, i'm doing you a jsfiddle :)
[22:39:46] <coldhead> i don't know how that's gonna work out, i just took a whole bunch of pills
[22:39:50] <coldhead> but let's see how we go
[22:42:09] <coldhead> hemingway like himalayas
[22:42:13] <coldhead> hope for warm bodies
[22:44:26] <khaan> http://jsfiddle.net/BXjk2/ -> every row should appear one after another. It would be nice if i could use the same time delay (despite the content is loaded or not) and if i could store the sequence into an array
[22:50:16] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/6awdE/
[22:50:18] <Eviltwin> Bastard!
[22:50:20] <Eviltwin> He left
[22:50:46] <coldhead> what a jerk
[22:51:19] <tw2113> what about me
[22:51:21] <coldhead> that is a far better solution than he deserved anyway
[22:51:43] <coldhead> khmer: do you know khaan?
[22:51:47] <coldhead> you got similar names
[22:51:52] <coldhead> can you tell him he's a jerk?
[22:53:21] <tw2113> you're a jerk, person!
[22:53:29] <coldhead> he sure is
[22:59:01] <screamingbanshee> @coldhead gnarf says hello

[23:12:26] <jeff_sebring> how can I run a script after all others have executed? ive tried $(window).load, but it's not late enough. this page is horrible
[23:12:31] <darkc0de> Hi. help please. how can i run a function one at a time? please see screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/1FMEaQf.png
[23:15:04] <coldhead> jeff_sebring: could you remove the <script> tags and instead load them via getScript?
[23:15:11] <coldhead> then you could use getScript's success handler
[23:15:17] <coldhead> and wait for them all to finish
[23:15:36] <jeff_sebring> you mean load the other scripts?
[23:15:54] <coldhead> yes
[23:16:00] <jeff_sebring> i don't have control over those. it's an attrocious decnetwork site
[23:16:22] <jeff_sebring> I'm trying to add tooltips to js generated elements
[23:16:41] <coldhead> oh
[23:16:45] <jeff_sebring> this is about the worst possible page
[23:17:21] <jeff_sebring> deconetwork*
[23:17:22] <coldhead> in situations like that i'd just keep polling for the relevant elements, give them a "tooltipped" class when they're done so you don't keep hitting them
[23:17:55] <coldhead> i had to do something similar to add some magic to any twitter @name that appeared anywhere on a page
[23:18:04] <coldhead> nothing i'm proud of but i lived to tell the tale
[23:18:36] <Nobita> how can I define text to the first line of my html
[23:18:44] <jeff_sebring> im somewhat of a js noob, ill have to figure out how to do that
[23:18:46] <Nobita> any function for that?
[23:18:59] <Nobita> to define text to the first line of html
[23:19:18] <coldhead> Nobita: $('body').prepend('<span>no particular place to go</span>')
[23:19:27] <coldhead> jeff_sebring: hold up, i'll demo you something
[23:19:44] <jeff_sebring> this is one of those things where you think it's going to be easy, until you get into it and find out just how bad its built
[23:19:53] <jeff_sebring> coldhead, thanks id appreciate that
[23:20:03] <Nobita> coldhead: thanks, let me try :)
[23:22:56] <coldhead> jeff_sebring: http://jsfiddle.net/sYQ2g/
[23:23:08] <coldhead> don't tell anyone i helped you with that, i'm supposed to be a professional
[23:23:39] <jeff_sebring> coldhead, lol thanks
[23:24:19] <tw2113> professional on your first day?
[23:24:20] <tw2113> wtf
[23:24:33] <jeff_sebring> im doing it for a friend, but at least im getting paid for it
[23:24:41] <coldhead> to quote cameron on ferris bueller's day off "professional what?"
[23:24:58] <coldhead> also the guy he was referring to was played by an old sonic youth drummer
[23:25:00] <coldhead> TRUE FACT
[23:25:17] <tw2113> SY <3
[23:25:17] <jeff_sebring> if it isn't Venkman
[23:25:39] <tw2113> true fact jeff_sebring, #jQuery is still on autojoin
[23:26:13] <jeff_sebring> at least im watching GoT while I do this horrible thing
[23:26:24] <tw2113> current episodes?
[23:26:40] <tw2113> have you read the books at all?
[23:27:08] <jeff_sebring> yea tonight's. haven't read them
[23:27:19] <tw2113> what scene you at?
[23:27:34] <coldhead> the one with the dragon and the boobs
[23:27:37] <jeff_sebring> i actually already watched it earlier, then Mad Men
[23:27:51] <tw2113> so you know the cliffhanger already
[23:28:06] <coldhead> OMG THERE IS A CLIFFHANGER?!
[23:28:08] <coldhead> SPOILERS
[23:28:11] <jeff_sebring> yea, just when he did a nice thing too
[23:28:35] <tw2113> coldhead, someone showed their boobs
[23:28:46] <tw2113> and there was a pimp that squired to an imp
[23:28:57] <jeff_sebring> lol
[23:29:04] <morficus> yet another Game of Thrones conversation? geez.. I just can't escape from it tonight it seems
[23:29:08] <darkc0de> Hi. help please. how can i run a function one at a time? please see screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/1FMEaQf.png
[23:29:15] <jeff_sebring> nerds love the GoT
[23:29:39] <jeff_sebring> and this is IRC so . .
[23:30:00] <tw2113> darkc0de, exactly how long do you expect function 1 to run?
[23:30:02] <coldhead> darkc0de: your question confuses and infuriates me
[23:30:24] <DarkKnightCZ> ^
[23:31:05] <DarkKnightCZ> anyway, it should be enough to put all of it inside that ready() function
[23:31:07] <tw2113> js = single threaded, i think they ARE going 1 after the other
[23:31:14] <jeff_sebring> coldhead, this demo is incredibly instructive, thanks
[23:31:31] <jeff_sebring> mum is the word
[23:34:58] <darkc0de> <tw2113> darkc0de, exactly how long do you expect function 1 to run? - maybe .5 secs?
[23:35:03] <darkc0de> is it possible? it runs at the same time.
[23:35:21] <tw2113> no
[23:35:26] <tw2113> js is single threaded
[23:35:26] <morficus> darkc0de: I garantee it's not running at the same time
[23:35:40] <coldhead> 'cept for hollabacks
[23:36:40] <yaboo> hi all playing with jquery mobile and google maps and wanted to ask how can I make a info window similar to this http://m.petster.com.au/IMG_1241.jpg with jquery mobile
[23:39:02] <coldhead> i'd outsource
[23:39:08] <coldhead> it looks hard
[23:40:55] <morficus> yaboo: that looks very Sencha-like. but the answer to your question is.... just use Google maps like you would normally
[23:41:04] <morficus> the custom pop-over is part of the Google Maps API
[23:42:01] <morficus> yaboo: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overlays#Icons
[23:42:24] <yaboo> morficus understand that the info window in google maps is a div I believe, trying to find the jquery mobile way if that makes sense.
[23:43:51] <morficus> or this might be more what you looking for, specifically the info-window: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overlays#InfoWindows
[23:44:07] <yaboo> thanks mortics
[23:44:12] <yaboo> morficus
[23:44:13] <morficus> I dont' think you're going to find a "jquery mobile way" of doing custom info windows with Google Maps
[23:44:19] <yaboo> ok
[23:44:32] <yaboo> if I can get it looking like my image, then I close
[23:44:33] <morficus> it's just CSS applied to a custom infoWindow
[23:44:37] <yaboo> school assignment
[23:44:45] <yaboo> morficus ok
[23:45:11] <morficus> just add your own CSS class to the maps infoWindow, and style away to your hearts content
[23:45:28] <coldhead> cute pun on content there <3
[23:47:42] <yaboo> morficus thanks guess thought that so it opens a html page with the store info.
[23:51:18] <Dragooon_Mac> Anybody? http://smf-media.com/community/?theme=4
[23:53:24] <coldhead> what's the question, Dragooon_Mac?
[23:53:34] <coldhead> Anybody?
[23:53:35] <Dragooon_Mac> coldhead: No question, looking for feedback
[23:55:15] <tw2113> it looks like a url
[23:55:18] <tw2113> clicks like one too
[23:55:28] <Dragooon_Mac> You don't say!
[23:55:38] <tw2113> oh but i do
[23:55:56] <coldhead> Dragooon_Mac: menu and full site text is not vertically centered
[23:56:07] <coldhead> copyright might look better left or right aligned
[23:56:17] <coldhead> there should be more users online
[23:56:18] <Woet> looks like a mobile template gone wrong Dragooon_Mac
[23:56:20] <Woet> to be honest
[23:56:34] <Woet> oh, it is supposed to be for mobile :)
[23:56:35] <Woet> nvm then
[23:56:55] <Dragooon_Mac> Woet: It's based on jQuery Mobile, it's supposed to be on mobile :P
[23:57:08] <Woet> i always prefer responsive sites
[23:57:18] <Woet> so not a separate theme for mobile, but one that changes based on resolution
[23:57:22] <Woet> but looks good
[23:57:42] <coldhead> i prefer having beautiful people massage mayonnaise into my crotch but it's not gonna happen
[23:58:01] * Woet blinks
[23:58:04] <Dragooon_Mac> coldhead: Vertically aligned too? You mean vertically in middle?
[23:58:06] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[23:58:15] <coldhead> i mean centered, yes Dragooon_Mac
[23:58:28] <Dragooon_Mac> Ah
[23:58:29] <coldhead> it hardly matters, it looks like every other site based on jqm
[23:58:31] <Dragooon_Mac> Okay
[23:58:41] <coldhead> maybe having them off center is a unique point of difference!
[23:58:55] <coldhead> COME TO MY SITE -- THE BUTTON TEXT IS NOT CENTERED!
[23:59:53] * coldhead np: animal collective - essplode
[23:59:59] <Dragooon_Mac> coldhead: Lol no, it's the 2px border-top that's making it off center
