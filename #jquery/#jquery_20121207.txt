[00:05:09] <aqeel> anyone here today
[00:05:52] <slite> aqeel: whats the question?
[00:06:03] <aqeel> var k = e.charCode ? e.charCode : e.keyCode ? e.keyCode : e.which;....use this || operator..???
[00:06:12] <aqeel> please explain
[00:06:40] <slite> explain what?
[00:07:14] <aqeel> i got this line...var k = e.charCode ? e.charCode : e.keyCode ? e.keyCode : e.which;
[00:07:39] <aqeel> and am getting error use || operator
[00:07:57] <medoix> hi all, i am trying to auto load a variable that is generated into a JSON file, but cannot get it to display any ideas? http://pastebin.com/dLU6NabW
[00:09:40] <aqeel> why am i getting theerror
[00:09:57] <slite> aqeel: code sample?
[00:10:12] <aqeel> var k = e.charCode ? e.charCode : e.keyCode ? e.keyCode : e.which;
[00:10:41] <jaffipaffi> Hey guys.. I have a slider, and a trigger that fires on mouseup. It is because I want to submit a form whenever someone have changed the slider values: http://jsfiddle.net/RNAus/
[00:10:47] <slite> medoix: data is already json when you set dataType json
[00:11:00] <jaffipaffi> It works fine when choosing a value in the middle
[00:11:03] <slite> aqeel: please add it to a context, jsfiddle..
[00:11:28] <aqeel> well it is not jsfiddle but jslint error
[00:11:32] <jaffipaffi> But once you choose a value to the left or right (e.g. to min and max of the slider) and "flicks" your mouse to one of the sides, it doesn't fire
[00:11:36] <jaffipaffi> Any ideas on how I can solve this?
[00:12:24] <JCDenton> I'm trying to get a jQuery preloader to work, but Chrome keeps reporting the page giving a console error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'preloader' of undefined", even though it works perfectly fine when I test it locally. Is something on this page conflicting with the script somehow?
[00:12:26] <JCDenton> http://www.anime-social.com/gallery/image/29-one-true-gift/
[00:12:36] <slite> jaffipaffi: hm, i get the alert box..
[00:13:13] <jaffipaffi> slite: Also when you "flick" your mouse to one of each sides of the slider?
[00:13:15] <jaffipaffi> Sec... doing a video
[00:13:37] <jaffipaffi> It is because when you flick the mouse quickly (to "reset" the slider), the cursor moves from the ui-handle
[00:13:42] <jaffipaffi> Because it can't get further
[00:14:08] <aqeel> slite: http://jsfiddle.net/c8yHk/
[00:14:20] <aqeel> here is the full code and trying to clean up the errors
[00:14:32] <medoix> $('#balance').html('<p>' + JSON.parse(data) +'</p>); - Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[00:15:02] <slite> jaffipaffi: http://jsfiddle.net/RNAus/1/ , that what you want?
[00:15:40] <jaffipaffi> slite: Yeah! Stupid me not knowing there was a changed event -.-
[00:15:41] <jaffipaffi> Thanks!
[00:15:57] <slite> jaffipaffi: np
[00:16:26] <dwarder> is everything ok with this http://pastebin.com/GnMc7ji7
[00:16:27] <dwarder> ?
[00:16:42] <dwarder> it doesn't work
[00:16:48] <dwarder> for somereason
[00:17:32] <slite> aqeel: you got a plugin that don't work? If thats the case, try another one..?
[00:17:59] <aqeel> no it works, just cleaning it up
[00:18:12] <tw2113> dwarder, it's working for me in jsbin.com
[00:18:15] <slite> dwarder: it seem correct if you got an element with id "selectid"
[00:19:06] <aqeel> i just do not know why people come up with plugins that are prone to so may errors....even as simple as to block or put semi colons
[00:19:10] <dwarder> i see, then i messed up something else
[00:19:22] <JCDenton> Sorry, I forgot to link the script.
[00:19:23] <JCDenton> http://www.anime-social.com/public/js/3rd_party/preloader.js
[00:20:03] <JCDenton> I'm basically using the preloader posted here, http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-to-create-an-awesome-image-preloader/
[00:20:57] <aqeel> if you can just help me with simplifying it , would be of great help
[00:21:19] <aqeel> var k = e.charCode ? e.charCode : e.keyCode ? e.keyCode : e.which;
[00:21:23] <aqeel> having use of ||
[00:21:25] <slite> aqeel: that plugin won't work in noConflict mode..
[00:22:12] <slite> the rest is valid js as far as i can tell
[00:22:37] <aqeel> yes but jslint is you know, bad ass kicking
[00:22:42] <medoix> slite: $('#balance').html('<p>' + JSON.parse(data) +'</p>); - Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[00:22:59] <slite> medoix: you miss a "'" after "</p>"
[00:24:08] <medoix> slite: thank you! haha so stupid
[00:24:38] <slite> aqeel: you can write it as if/else if, not sure why jslint complain
[00:25:11] <aqeel> it says use || operator....
[00:26:33] <slite> aqeel: well, you have to check the logic.. Unless im missing something, you can type it as: var k = null; if (e.charCode) { k = e.charCode; } else if (e.keyCode) { k = e.keyCode; } else { k = e.which; }
[00:26:44] <pifantastic> aqeel: why are you using the result of JSON.parse as HTML?
[00:27:02] <aqeel> huh??
[00:27:12] <pifantastic> whoops
[00:27:15] <pifantastic> wrong person
[00:27:23] <pifantastic> was meant for medoix
[00:27:28] <pifantastic> medoix: ^^
[00:28:23] <medoix> pifantastic: no idea tbh, i was getting help from soneone earlier in the cakephp channel
[00:28:41] <aqeel> but it does not make sense, why would it say make use of || operator
[00:29:00] <aqeel> really this jslint sometimes, dunno what to say
[00:29:13] <slite> aqeel: well, i guess you can write it with || also
[00:29:31] <aqeel> thanks
[00:29:31] <slite> aqeel: try write it with ||...
[00:29:41] <medoix> pifantastic: this jquery grabs the output of that function and displays it in the template
[00:29:43] <slite> but, it doesn't change the code logic
[00:29:45] <medoix> pifantastic: how should it work?
[00:29:59] <aqeel> that is what i was wondering
[00:30:16] <pifantastic> medoix: if it works, it works, it's just a bit odd to see :P
[00:30:37] <slite> aqeel: i find it weird that jslint call it a error instead of depricated tho
[00:31:29] <aqeel> well what can be said...
[00:31:42] <slite> aqeel: var k = e.charCode || e.keyCode || e.which; should do the same if i read this correctly
[00:31:59] <slite> maybe more readable, donno
[00:33:19] <greek> Hi fellas. I'm getting this error: "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: unsupported pseudo: component" and I think it's because my selected class name contains colons, ie: <input type='text' class='component:abc' />. Any idea how to select elements whose classes contain ":" ? Or is this pseudo error caused by something else
[00:34:25] <aqeel> ok let me see...
[00:34:37] <aqeel> thanks
[00:35:18] <medoix> is there a way to get this to run on load instead of just after the timer hits? http://pastebin.com/MARziuXB
[00:36:51] <medoix> meh i just copied the do code to the top aswell.. lol

[00:58:00] <trumpetmic> any reason this wouldn't redirect you to the page referenced by the link you clicked?  http://notey.it/n/MTJj
[00:58:13] <trumpetmic> running it on theassassinsdream.com
[00:58:19] <xec> trumpetmic: there is no callback with .addClass()
[00:58:26] <xec> :D
[00:58:28] <trumpetmic> just want to fade the page out and then redirect
[00:58:39] <trumpetmic> xec, I have no idea what I'm doing.  ;)
[00:58:39] <xec> maybe you want .animate() ?
[00:58:56] <trumpetmic> I'm using css transitions between the invisible and visible classes for the fading
[00:59:39] <trumpetmic> ok, so xec, are you saying the .animate() has a callback?
[01:00:30] <xec> trumpetmic: yes, but that will be a javascript animation, not css, see ?animate
[01:00:31] <bot-t> trumpetmic, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[01:01:29] <xec> i have a meeting now. good luck!
[01:01:39] <trumpetmic> thanks.  I wanted to use css animations, but maybe this is the way to go
[01:05:37] <trumpetmic> aha http://www.graphicfusiondesign.com/blog/design/creating-fancy-css3-fade-in-animations-on-page-load/
[01:10:02] <Trudko> guys simple selector: http://jsbin.com/uruyup/1/edit

[01:13:41] <medoix> How would i make this url use the top level path? maybe HTTP_SERVER?  $.ajax({ url: "users/getBalance.json", success: function(data){
[01:35:05] <seutje> medoix: prepend with a slash?
[01:43:51] <JCDenton> I really don't understand why this preload script isn't loading correctly
[01:43:54] <JCDenton> I can see nothing wrong
[01:47:24] <medoix> seutje:that was it, i did figure it out. thanks!
[01:48:29] <medoix> JSON = "1000000" / CODE = $('#balance').html(JSON.parse(data)); - How do i get it to format the number into currency (1,000,000.00)?
[01:49:10] <medoix> i tried setting the JSON to the correct number but the jquery didnt like the commas
[02:06:26] <Guest33484> hi, when i click on a specified div, i would like to scroll to another place... so i tried: $("#contactlink").click(function(e) {   $("#contact").scrollTop();  });   but that scroll to the top of the page... not to the specified div... any idea?
[02:06:55] <ben13> hi guys. im new to c# n jquery can someone help me with an ajax problem. http://forums.asp.net/t/1864254.aspx/1?ajax+sending+data+to+controller
[02:19:45] <RanzQ> hi, I'm having a problem with UI draggable, only start event is firing
[02:20:05] <RanzQ> any idea what might cause that or how could I debug it?
[02:22:10] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/c8yHk/1/
[02:22:22] <aqeel> i am having this issue again
[02:22:33] <aqeel> but on another function
[02:25:10] <aqeel> Guest33484: u can make use of anchor
[02:25:10] <medoix> JSON = "1000000" / CODE = $('#balance').html(JSON.parse(data)); - How do i get it to format the number into currency (1,000,000.00)?
[02:25:31] <aqeel> for simple jump, else for easing we use plugins
[02:26:08] <aqeel> use animate instead of scrollTop or may be third party scroll
[02:29:38] <Guest33484> aqueel: i need to use the scroll because there are an validation who are done... if there are an error, we want to go to the div where the error is
[02:30:15] <aqeel> why use scroll
[02:30:47] <aqeel> simply use a div have it hidden and if any error simply display it and click ok then hide again and go to form
[02:31:09] <aqeel> if eror scroll to error then scroll back to form??
[02:32:22] <aqeel> in your case you can set the class to those element that has error and have it animate() on to the first error
[02:33:52] <aqeel> http://api.jquery.com/animate/            ...... read this part...Example: Animates the first div's left property and synchronizes the remaining divs, using the step function to set their left properties at each stage of the animation.
[02:34:25] <aqeel> here instead for all div you specify first error prone div and have it animate there..
[02:34:45] <aqeel> and in yourn case it is not the div but the containe rto that div
[02:36:02] <aqeel> or you can specify a position if there is an error to where it should scroll to and thus if error the container scrolls to that position
[02:37:11] <khismetix> I have a question about jquery ui /datepicker
[02:37:16] <aqeel> but you must specify the first error it eencounters other wise you dunno where to stop the scroll
[02:37:32] <aqeel> say of you have 2 or more error
[02:38:15] <aqeel> anyway animate() is the function you might be needing for that purpose
[02:38:27] <aqeel> got to go...bb in 2 hours...
[02:38:31] <aqeel> bye room
[02:38:53] <airdem> why is $(this).attr('id') working perfectly but $(this).attr('class') throwing an error?
[02:39:35] <khismetix> just looking at this on jsfiddle … http://jsfiddle.net/manikoth/Fa8Xx/   … what theme is being used there .. is it the default theme for that version of jsquery ui ?
[02:39:45] <khismetix> a sort of brown/mint green chocolate theme

[02:47:27] <YammYcoding> hi. I  have 3 numbered divs, like graphLabel0,graphLabel1,graphLabel2. And have a var like $legends with 3 items. I want to add each array item after each correspondent div id. How jquery could help me on that?
[02:50:24] <tlkr> YammYcoding,  $('.graphsSelector').each(function(i, e) { $(this).text($legends[i]) });
[02:50:27] <tlkr> or something like that.
[02:50:47] <YammYcoding> but $legends is php var
[02:51:29] <YammYcoding> whats i, e ?
[02:51:59] <tlkr> index and element -> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[02:53:26] <DarsVaeda1> anyone know a 360° panorama plugin that supports links in the pano?
[02:53:44] <tlkr> you either need to asynchronously fetch the variable as json/xml output or output it using PHP, in which case you wouldn't use jquery
[02:53:51] <Hapzz> hi all
[02:53:51] <tlkr> YammYcoding
[02:53:56] <YammYcoding> hmm
[02:55:42] <YammYcoding> i was thinking of printing the $legend items with php, problem is that i need to make php 'cursor' points to a place after each div, before printing
[02:57:47] <YammYcoding> hmm maybe i'm complicating
[02:58:11] <tlkr> Why don't you just print out the array values when you are outputting the divs?
[02:58:32] <YammYcoding> the divs are alrready beeing printed by javascript
[02:58:40] <YammYcoding> from a closed code
[02:59:20] <YammYcoding> its a graph generator code that places each bar in a td
[02:59:35] <YammYcoding> the columns vary according to amount of bars
[03:00:08] <YammYcoding> and the bars generator script.
[03:00:51] <YammYcoding> hmm maybe i can make another table after that one, with same td widths and concat with php

[03:38:59] <Krambiorix> hi, i see it's not possible to set a background color for QTIP 2 . One can only use css to change the style. Isn't there any way to dynamically change the background color for the qtip??
[03:48:39] <mike029> im having an issue with mobile.changePage and afterwards basically i can't do anything with jQuery... it seems like after the page is changed, jQuery isn't aware of anything on the page
[03:49:05] <mike029> if i have a button with an id then some code for when the button id is clicked, it doesnt go through
[03:49:42] <ruby_on_tails> if i create a function abc() should it be put inside $(document).ready() or outside it ?
[03:50:06] <_basic6> how do i make an input field which only allows integer numbers >=1 (default) ?
[03:50:14] <mike029> same thing for grabbing form fields, buttons, making lists dynamically...only difference lately is i upgraded cordova, is this causing the problem?
[03:51:40] <khismetix> Any idea why the datepicker here is shown even when the input hasn't been entered ?

[05:10:43] <bladicito> there is a way to execute a line of code after another one?
[05:11:15] <bladicito> or can i add an event on load to the iframe to check it is already on the dom?

[05:17:59] <aqeel> hi room
[05:19:44] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/sFUkN/
[05:19:50] <aqeel> how to rectify the error
[05:20:27] <seutje> doesn't the arguments variable only contain unnamed arguments?
[05:20:32] <aqeel> function gets 2 parameters but arguments[2] is the third parameter??
[05:21:20] <seutje> no wait, I'm tweaking
[05:21:27] <aqeel> but it is being suggested to use named parameter
[05:21:44] <seutje> oh lol
[05:21:53] <seutje> this isn't an error, it's a linting warning
[05:21:59] <aqeel> jslint error
[05:22:04] <seutje> so just use a named argument
[05:22:33] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/sFUkN/1/
[05:22:58] <aqeel> so how to grab it as function has only two parameters but argument[2] refers to be third parameter
[05:25:07] <airdem> is there a selector for .data()?
[05:25:08] <aqeel> this is the full code
[05:25:09] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/sFUkN/2/
[05:25:35] <aqeel> simply putting it in would not just work out right?
[05:25:38] <Hooloovoo> with the risk of starting a huge discussion
[05:25:42] <Hooloovoo> is "4" valid json?
[05:30:29] <aqeel> seutje: see he full code
[05:31:11] <seutje> u know, u don't have to abide to everything jslint says
[05:31:33] <aqeel> i know but then it is good to know the alternates
[05:32:45] <seutje> I don't really get why u can't just add a named param
[05:33:25] <aqeel> no i can but i want to know where elese the code needs this call...i do not want to break so far it is functional
[05:33:45] <seutje> wouldn't change anything, rly
[05:33:52] <seutje> xcept that using arguments is a slight perf hit
[05:34:06] <seutje> I mean arguments as in the magical variable called arguments
[05:34:20] <seutje> it doesn't get populated unless u use it
[05:34:42] <seutje> but either way, $t will be the same value
[05:34:50] <seutje> undefined if only 2 arguments were passed
[05:36:29] <aqeel> will this effect this block of code at second last of page   $.fn.autoscroll = function(a, b) {
[05:38:12] <seutje> aqeel: not really, those are just proxying stuff
[05:38:43] <seutje> suppose u could make it pass all named arguments one by one, but that's a bit silly
[05:38:44] <aqeel> so i just pop in the parameter an am fine to go
[05:38:56] <aqeel> will not effect the outer code?
[05:39:04] <seutje> don't think so
[05:41:35] <aqeel> ok thanks...
[05:45:04] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/sFUkN/4/

[06:16:38] <docmur> I can't think of the name of it
[06:18:33] <guilhermekfe> does .append() returns the element appended?
[06:28:36] <Rchristiani> Hey, I am having some trouble with jquery UI and Chrome mobile, I have some sortable items on a site, that do not quite work on chrome mobile, works alright with safari, ff, and the andriod browser. I added the touch punch to get it to work there, but still nothing really happening in chrome, anyone have any other tips?
[06:30:49] <misteroneill> Rchristiani: i tried getting jquery UI draggable with the "touch punch" patch to work and never could - ended up giving up and building my own solution :/
[06:31:02] <ruby_on_tails> $(document).on("click", ".lb_previous", function(){ navigate(-1); }); here i call a function inside the callback function, cant the navigate function be directly used as a callback ?
[06:31:27] <ruby_on_tails> $(document).on("click", ".lb_previous", navigate(-1)); like this ?
[06:32:42] <Rchristiani> misteroneill: yeah i am thinking that might be what has to happen. I can't seem to find too much out there one this
[06:33:00] <misteroneill> one of the biggest deficiencies of jquery ui
[06:33:06] <Rchristiani> yeah
[06:33:15] <Rchristiani> It is being worked on though, is it not?
[06:33:25] <misteroneill> not sure - i would think so!
[06:33:33] <Rchristiani> I would hope so
[06:34:06] <ruby_on_tails> anyone ?
[06:50:10] <ndimatteo> hey all, anyone able to help address an interesting problem I have? I asked last night, but the room was pretty dead at the time, hoping some more of you are on now
[06:58:23] <R00tk3y> Okay how would I do this
[06:59:06] <R00tk3y> I have a button that on the first click changes something, but on the next click I want it to revert back to previous state, would I use some sort of bind?
[07:09:51] <BlissOfBeing> How would I check to see if an html element contains one or more of the same element, nothing else?
[07:10:34] <BlissOfBeing> <div id="allsame"><br><br><p>hello</p><br></div> would be false and something like <div id="allsame"><br><br><br></div> would
[07:10:36] <BlissOfBeing>  be true
[07:17:26] <seutje> var $wrap = $('#allsame'), $children = $wrap.children(), first = $children[0].nodeName; return $children().not(first).length;
[07:17:56] <seutje> BlissOfBeing: ^ prolly a better way than that, but that'll try to find children that aren't the same element type as the first child
[07:18:10] <BillCriswell> seutje: Damn, was just coding that up.
[07:18:32] <seutje> oh crap, typo
[07:18:40] <seutje> remove the () from the last children thing
[07:19:03] <seutje> so like var $wrap = $('#allsame'), $children = $wrap.children(), first = $children[0].nodeName; return $children.not(first).length;
[07:21:29] <BlissOfBeing> i was thinknig of using regex.test
[07:22:21] <BlissOfBeing> seutje:  i like your way :)
[07:23:39] <BillCriswell> If you know what element you're looking for it could work that way, but you'll need to see what the first element it.
[07:23:41] <BillCriswell> is*
[07:23:50] <BillCriswell> I think seutje's way is much better.
[07:23:53] <BlissOfBeing> right, so i could just do:  return $children.not('br').length;
[07:24:18] <seutje> who are u talking to? o.O
[07:24:21] <BlissOfBeing> i'm only looking for <br>'s
[07:24:23] <BlissOfBeing> anyone
[07:24:55] <seutje> ew, regex for html parsing? :P
[07:25:20] <seutje> (I'm just saying that cause I really suck at regex)
[07:26:37] <BlissOfBeing> actually, $(".angular-mention").not('br').length; won't do it
[07:27:02] <BillCriswell> BlissOfBeing: You want $(this).children().not('br').length
[07:28:06] <BillCriswell> Well, $(".angular-mention").children().not('br').length
[07:28:22] <BlissOfBeing> BillCriswell:  how did you know that?
[07:28:45] <BlissOfBeing> BillCriswell:  thats tripping me out.
[07:29:23] <BillCriswell> I don't know what I figured out that I couldn't figure out from the problem you presented.
[07:29:46] <BlissOfBeing> no how did you know my classname?
[07:29:46] <BlissOfBeing> $(".angular-mention")
[07:29:57] <BillCriswell> You literally just said it lol.
[07:30:21] <BlissOfBeing> i did?
[07:30:31] <BlissOfBeing> oh, ha
[07:30:33] <BillCriswell> You said "actually, $(".angular-mention").not('br').length; won't do it"
[07:31:04] <BlissOfBeing> yea, :)
[07:32:18] <BlissOfBeing> this works as long as all the elements are wrapped. what if I have as innerHTML ='<br>hello world<br><br>'
[07:32:26] <BlissOfBeing> then .not doesn't work.
[07:33:27] <BlissOfBeing> well actually .children() doesn't catch them
[07:34:07] <BlissOfBeing> '<br>hello world<br><br>' .children() = [<br>,<br>,<br>]
[07:34:26] <BlissOfBeing> i think this actually is a problem for regex.test
[07:34:27] <BillCriswell> I just tried $('div').children().not('br').length on <div><br><br>Hi<br></div> and got 0.
[07:35:19] <BlissOfBeing> you'll get 0 with <br><br><br> too
[07:35:33] <BlissOfBeing> 0 is the true case
[07:36:26] <guilhermekfe_> suppose I receive the output of .appendTo() and place it on var el, how can I select the inner 'a[0]' from it?
[07:37:35] <BillCriswell> BlissOfBeing: Then do !$('div').children().not('br').length
[07:39:05] <BlissOfBeing> yea, 1 sec setting up a fiddle
[07:43:29] <BlissOfBeing> strange results: http://plnkr.co/edit/PUNjYH?p=preview
[07:44:11] <BlissOfBeing> BillCriswell:  look at the last test.
[07:47:06] <BillCriswell> BlissOfBeing: Oh, if text is in there you want it to fail.
[07:47:13] <BlissOfBeing> right
[07:47:48] <BillCriswell> BlissOfBeing: Check out http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[07:49:49] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/uyiyaz/1/edit Should help you get on your way to figuring it out.
[07:50:16] <BlissOfBeing> I got it: http://plnkr.co/edit/PUNjYH?p=preview
[07:50:28] <BillCriswell> Ok awesome.
[07:50:42] <BlissOfBeing> based on answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/298750/how-do-i-select-text-nodes-with-jquery
[07:50:50] <BlissOfBeing> thanks for your help BillCriswell
[07:50:55] <BillCriswell> BlissOfBeing: No problem.
[07:51:11] <BillCriswell> It kept me occupied during a meeting. =)
[08:08:51] <adz> hi. I am trying to use jQuery UI sortable on a dynamic list (the LI elements that are draggable would be dynamically added by user). How dow I dynamically link the handle?
[08:13:35] <cusco> hi
[08:13:55] <cusco> can 't I state var a = $.load('url'); and have a = html in the url ?
[08:16:21] <arian> cusco, no
[08:16:46] <xec_> ?ajax101 @ cusco
[08:16:49] <bot-t> cusco, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[08:23:06] <halcyon1234> jqm: I'm trying to get the offset().top of an element when page loads (so I can scroll to it), but keep getting "0". Am I binding to the wrong event?
[08:23:07] <halcyon1234> http://jsbin.com/eqakid/1/
[08:23:23] <halcyon1234> Sorry, link to editable version: http://jsbin.com/eqakid/1/edit
[08:24:03] <nchlssmith1> I want to pose a question and this may not even be the right place but can  I link a single div to a css style sheet?
[08:25:45] <cusco> arian: ok i'm using .get
[08:25:56] <cusco> witch is simpler to write
[08:26:12] <cusco> my question nwo is, I am seeing the return and has .responseText
[08:26:21] <cusco> but var.responseText is undefined
[08:26:22] <cusco> :(
[08:27:07] <xec_> cusco: show us your code? "var" is not a valid variable name..
[08:27:27] <arian> and also $.get doesn't return some object with the responseText or something
[08:27:49] <cusco> xec_: http://paste.debian.net/214940/
[08:27:52] <arian> you have to use a callback, where you can continue
[08:28:27] <arian> cusco, $.get or XMLHttpRequest for that matter, are not synchronous/blocking
[08:28:27] <cusco> xec_: arian on the console from chrome, whgere I can browse the object, there is a responseText propertie
[08:28:58] <arian> probably one which get filled later..
[08:29:06] <cusco> I see
[08:29:24] <cusco> so I will use ajax, and use success:
[08:29:26] <cusco> gah
[08:32:33] <xec_> cusco: read the links that bot-t gave you
[08:32:50] <xec_> cusco: and check out the examples in the docs
[08:32:55] <xec_> ?get
[08:32:59] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[08:33:06] <xec_> sorry
[08:33:23] <xec_> i thought you were using .getJSON() :P
[08:33:25] <xec_> ignore me
[08:35:21] <xec_> cusco, no i was right the first time round, sorry for the confusion, $.get() is different from $().get() - see ? $.get
[08:35:23] <bot-t> cusco, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[08:37:14] <kamo> hello all
[08:37:42] <kamo> So what issues are seen with having to versiona of jQuery on the page
[08:39:05] <aqeel> Expected a conditional expression and instead saw an assignment.
[08:39:23] <aqeel> if ((l = $(e).data(ek)) && !eE(l, c)) {
[08:39:34] <aqeel> how to rectify this
[08:40:28] <arian> aqeel, either use ==, or change your jshint options
[08:40:35] <arian> iirc the option is called "boss"
[08:40:53] <aqeel> thanks
[08:43:04] <aqeel> Move the invocation into the parens that contain the function.  })(jQuery);
[08:44:09] <adz> for jQuery Sortable is there any way to make the element being MOVED fire an event?
[08:44:18] <aqeel> }(jQuery);)
[08:44:29] <aqeel> what is the difference
[08:44:59] <adz> Backbone needs an event listener set up on the LI being moved
[08:45:15] <aqeel>  })(jQuery); and  }(jQuery));
[08:45:16] <adz> that way it can reference the model "attached" to it
[08:49:14] <juboba> I created a calendar, but the events in the calendar don't fit. So I want to show a hidden div with the details of the events in that day. What can I use to create the details?
[08:57:17] <bmcginty> Good morning. Strange question for you all. I'm developing a web browser with javascript support. In a bunch of my pages using jquery, I'm getting a never ending set of requests for document.jquery$number where $number is a unix-like timestamp. Might any of the jquery developers know what is causing this? (and I do realize it's a problem with my browser, not the jquery.)
[08:58:02] <R00tk3y> Bmc, not sure maybe timeoutinterval
[08:58:35] <R00tk3y> Oh you said it was a problem with your browser, than we can't really help you
[08:59:00] <bmcginty> R00tk3y: understood, I'll take a look at my settimeout and setinterval functions.
[08:59:18] <bmcginty> R00tk3y: thanks.
[08:59:28] <juboba> any ideas of a plugin for hovering html content?
[09:00:10] <BillCriswell> juboba: A tooltip?
[09:00:42] <xec_> juboba: the word "css" springs to mind
[09:01:29] <aqeel>   })(jQuery); and  }(jQuery));....what is the difference
[09:01:40] <R00tk3y> Aqeel, there is none
[09:01:44] <R00tk3y> Just a preference
[09:01:45] <aqeel> which is good practice
[09:01:49] <R00tk3y> Either
[09:01:50] <xec_> either is fine
[09:02:14] <aqeel> thanks

[09:40:15] <aqeel> guys jslint for dreamweaver rovks
[09:40:23] <aqeel> rocks*
[09:42:31] <aqeel> Caelum: are you saying the user manually turns it off or are you implying through code it page loads as strict standard mode
[09:44:11] <jacoluta> http://pastebin.com/kEWSxVrS -- you will notice i use 'i' as the key for value pairs in the assignment
[09:44:25] <jacoluta> i want to use the iterating 'i' from the $.each
[09:44:29] <jacoluta> but it puts a literal i
[09:44:36] <jacoluta> not the incremented value
[09:44:38] <jacoluta> any suggestions?
[09:46:55] <Caelum> aqeel: I mean if the user has it on for some reason for the page, to use html or js to turn it off for the page
[09:48:08] <aqeel> u can use meta tag it will force it to load in standard as if it changes to compatibility for that i am not sure what will happen
[09:48:57] <Caelum> aqeel: cool, thank you
[09:49:26] <jacoluta> Better phrasing. How do I use a variable as a key value in object?
[09:49:59] <Caelum> jacoluta: object[variable]
[09:50:36] <jacoluta> derka der
[09:50:49] <jacoluta> i was trying Obj.ids = {i : 'item'}

[09:52:23] <derekpioneer> so that the loading image shows
[09:53:01] <derekpioneer> even when i manually set attr('src', ''); it seems like the previous image stays in there

[10:18:16] <Whirl3d> Good morning all. I'm using jquery UI (latest) and wondered if there was an easy way (either with/wihtout UI) to make two divs fill up the width of the screen, but remain resizable.
[10:18:42] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: width: 50%; float: left;
[10:18:47] <aqeel> you can use animate with some jquery to do that though
[10:19:28] <Whirl3d> BillCriswell, thanks for the reply. You realize of course that resizing one of the boxes will leave a gap then.
[10:19:46] <aqeel> that is where jquery comes in
[10:20:07] <Whirl3d> I can write the script to handle the resize event and manually calculate the other percent, easy enough. I just wondered if jquery UI had something like that since they do for vertical
[10:20:17] <Whirl3d> No need to reinvent the wheel, I figured.
[10:20:42] <aqeel> but yes ui might too much as it has load of extra included
[10:21:16] <ziz_> aqeel, yes I saw all their JS
[10:21:25] <ziz_> but I was trying to find which pertained to that action
[10:22:58] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: I thought you were talking about resizing the window.
[10:23:08] <Whirl3d> Sure. I am using UI for other things so I figured if it was a switch or a line of css or something,  it'd be better than writing a resize routine.
[10:23:34] <Whirl3d> BillCriswell, my bad. I mean resizing the boxes.
[10:24:14] <Whirl3d> In jquery UI there's an accordian option for height that fills the available height. I wondered if there was an undocumented equivalent for width?
[10:26:57] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: Not that I'm aware of. I think your best bet would be to google "horizontal accordion"
[10:27:21] <Whirl3d> Yeah. Or write it myself. That's easy enough. Thanks for the input, though.
[10:29:33] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: It looks like enough people built plugins for it already. It could save you some time. Just a suggestion.
[10:35:53] <Hapzz> why is this empty $('form#markRows').serialize();
[10:36:01] <Hapzz> i've a form with id="markRows"
[10:36:05] <jjb123> Hey everyone, quick question. I'm developing a jQuery widget and trying to get it so that it doesn't conflict with Prototype (which used the $ symbol) when included on a page. Here is my code: http://ideone.com/yHYCct Right now, I get this error: http://ideone.com/4fmifI which goes away when I get rid of prototype. Any ideas?
[10:36:14] <NoiseEee> Hapzz: just $('#markRows')
[10:36:30] <goleif> Hi! I have linked the jQuery package to a parent window, and I'm trying to access the jQuery object from the child window. How do I do it? window.parent.jQuery gives me absolutely nothing
[10:36:48] <Hapzz> NoiseEee i need to pass it to $.get
[10:37:11] <NoiseEee> Hapzz: irrelevant, $('#markRows') instead of $('form#markRows')
[10:37:26] <Hapzz> oh, wait, why?
[10:37:27] <NoiseEee> goleif: unless the parent window already has included jquery, you can't use jquery methods on/in it
[10:37:38] <NoiseEee> Hapzz: id's are unique, just pass the ID
[10:37:55] <NoiseEee> "I have linked the jQuery package to a parent window" i don't know what that means goleif
[10:38:03] <Hapzz> well, still empty
[10:38:15] <goleif> NoiseEee: Sorry, English is not my first language
[10:38:17] <LindsayMac> Does anyoe here have any experience with isotope and pagination?
[10:38:25] <NoiseEee> Hapzz: then that's not the ID and/or you have nothing to serialize
[10:38:46] <goleif> NoiseEee: I am using jQuery in the parent window, and I know I should be able to use the same object from the child window
[10:38:56] <NoiseEee> 'same object' ?
[10:39:01] <Hapzz> what?
[10:39:16] <Hapzz> well, it is the id, and i have a bunch of checkboxes there
[10:39:48] <goleif> I want to avoid making another HTTP request to the jQuery file, so I want to use the object that already exists in the parent window
[10:39:54] <LindsayMac> I am looking for some tutorials or examples where this is used and I cant seem to find ANYTHING
[10:40:51] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/PVfX3/ @ Hapzz
[10:41:07] <systemfault> goleif: ... One word... Caching
[10:42:11] <NoiseEee> goleif: you don't get to use the library for another document iirc
[10:42:27] <Hapzz> NoiseEee uhm, looks like jquery is ignoring the inputs because they're inside a table?
[10:42:59] <NoiseEee> Hapzz: nope
[10:43:09] <NoiseEee> Hapzz: of course if you've got nothing checked there's nothing to serialize right
[10:43:24] <NoiseEee> Hapzz: maybe you have bad markup? good luck
[10:43:28] <Hapzz> NoiseEee yeah, obviously, but i do have some checked
[10:43:44] <Hapzz> it all goes through Tidy, so it's not the markup i guess
[10:43:46] <goleif> NoiseEee: I know I have done it before. Can't I do it now because of relatively recently added restrictions?
[10:44:20] <NoiseEee> goleif: im not sure to be honest, i don't like the approach, what if the page were loaded without a parent?
[10:44:37] <NoiseEee> goleif: cache your jquery.js, why are you worrying about a cached request
[10:44:52] <goleif> NoiseEee: In this case I'm positive it won't. Otherwise I wouldn't even try.
[10:45:05] <goleif> Because it feels like a bad getaround.
[10:45:13] <systemfault> A 34k HTTP transaction won't kill you...
[10:45:25] <NoiseEee> a bad go-around is trying to use JS in scripts defined in other documents.
[10:45:25] <systemfault> Perhaps you could use localstorage to cache it manually...
[10:45:30] <NoiseEee> there is nothing good about that approach, goleif
[10:45:33] <goleif> My solution won't kill me either. I wanna learn this, not find any other method.
[10:45:52] <NoiseEee> goleif: then go for it, its just a totally odd/silly approach
[10:46:00] <NoiseEee> imo anyways
[10:46:15] <goleif> Perhaps.
[10:55:01] <aqeel> LindsayMac: for pagination ....http://flaviusmatis.github.com/simplePagination.js/
[10:55:01] <Caelum> aqeel: putting that meta tag into all our pages now :)
[10:55:10] <aqeel> cool
[10:55:16] <LindsayMac> aqeel: I
[10:55:27] <aqeel> yes pagination links
[10:55:38] <LindsayMac> m familiar with some of the pagination plugins, I just don't really know how to integrate it with isotope or what I should look out for when trying to use both at the same time
[10:55:57] <aqeel> isotopw, is it library
[10:56:15] <LindsayMac> huh?
[10:56:20] <LindsayMac> is it library? huh
[10:56:33] <LindsayMac> thia: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
[10:56:36] <LindsayMac> this*
[10:57:07] <aqeel> so what is your aim
[10:57:40] <LindsayMac> to pull all blog posts and paginate them but still be able to use the filtering for all items including those that are hidden on another page
[10:57:43] <aqeel> what is it that you want to paginate
[10:57:56] <LindsayMac> they are blog posts, but basically anything that is an isotope item
[10:58:53] <aqeel> well it is a tough call....will take time
[10:59:03] <aqeel> at moment i am busy myself
[10:59:27] <aqeel> do you have your content gethered from isotope
[10:59:34] <LindsayMac> aqeel:  i appreciate you looking at it. I don't need someone to do it for me, I am happy to be given some type of direction / example so I can take a look myself
[11:00:39] <aqeel> start from isotope...have your things listed as to how many pages arre there going to be and on which page what content you want to load..
[11:01:03] <aqeel> if using ajax, load methos used on()
[11:01:27] <Whirl3d> anybody else getting unsafe js errors using jsfiddle.net?
[11:01:47] <LindsayMac> aqeel: yea I have my blog posts gathered and isotope is putting them in the "masonry" format / grid. I just want to be able to pull all of them with PHP and then paginate / filter
[11:02:05] <LindsayMac> aqeel:  i am not super familiar with AJAX, i am just getting in to javascript in general
[11:02:30] <aqeel> well blog post content , is this not done by ajax?
[11:02:40] <LindsayMac> aqeel:  hold on one minute. Visitor just popped in..
[11:02:50] <aqeel> np
[11:06:32] <LindsayMac> aqeel:  ok back. So I am pulling in the blog post content with basic PHP
[11:06:47] <LindsayMac> aqeel: then isotope does the filtering based on the tags that I have in the HTML
[11:08:31] <Whirl3d> Could someone list the best Chrome extensions for jquery development? Or at least their favorites?
[11:11:49] <misteroneill> Whirl3d: i just use the built-in developer tools
[11:12:28] <BillCriswell> I do most development incognito, just to avoid extensions screwing with me.
[11:12:59] <Whirl3d> BillCriswell, that is a great idea. I keep having extension errors, so I'll try that. Thanks
[11:13:32] <BillCriswell> I stole that tip from Paul Irish a long time ago.
[11:13:45] <BillCriswell> Been playing it off as my own, though. You're welcome.
[11:14:11] <Whirl3d> Problems Solved. Wow, what a simple solution. LOL Thanks Bill, Paul.
[11:16:52] <BillCriswell> No problem. I'm sure he'd say the same haha.
[11:19:45] <monk12> hello all, I have an array of simple objects var names = [{id:'blah',name:'x'}, ..., ..., ...]; and I'd like to use $jQuery.load() to pass this as JSON to a Java/jsp page. i think i can import JSON libraries in the java/jsp to get this info... but wasn't sure how to pass it up in the 'data'.
[11:20:16] <monk12> i saw some weird syntax for arrays in the documentation.
[11:20:30] <monk12> like: { 'choices[]': ["Jon", "Susan"] }
[11:22:29] <hlve[workaholic]> Is there any reason why this JSON post ( http://pastebin.com/2AxQRbmC ) is returning: seatCount=6, instead of returning { seatCount: "6" }
[11:22:30] <hlve[workaholic]> o_o
[11:24:21] <hlve[workaholic]> Any idear?
[11:30:16] <NoiseEee> hlve[workaholic]: i'd ask your backend about it
[11:34:30] <R00tk3y> Ok what cool things we learning about today in #jQuery
[11:36:15] <fission6> i want to select a bunch of elements, loop through them and extra some "data" attributes, is this ideal? http://dpaste.org/kGhfn/
[11:37:01] <R00tk3y> Fission looks right
[11:37:36] <systemfault> The way you're doing it is a bit bad.
[11:37:37] <R00tk3y> Although your using
[11:37:38] <R00tk3y> value
[11:37:43] <R00tk3y> You should use
[11:37:44] <R00tk3y> $(this)
[11:37:53] <fission6> why?
[11:38:08] <R00tk3y> I believe, $(this) refers to the current, in your case div. that it is on
[11:38:16] <systemfault> fission6: jQuery loves to set 'this' to the current item... Use it if you want.
[11:38:17] <fission6> same as value no?
[11:38:26] <systemfault> fission6: Yes.
[11:38:36] <R00tk3y> It might be the same
[11:38:48] <R00tk3y> I haven't used .each enough to know
[11:38:48] <hlve[workaholic]> Is there any reason why this JSON post ( http://pastebin.com/2AxQRbmC ) is returning: seatCount=6, instead of returning { seatCount: "6" }
[11:38:49] <hlve[workaholic]> o.o
[11:38:54] <R00tk3y> But I was just saying it might be better
[11:38:59] <systemfault> fission6: The real "meh" in your code is that you wrap the node 3 times per iteration
[11:39:14] <R00tk3y> Yes let systemfault tell ya im gonna help hlve
[11:39:15] <MistuhKurtz> same thing. I prefer this because it's I find it slightly clearer and easier to immediately ascertain what it is
[11:39:24] <R00tk3y> HLVE
[11:39:30] <hlve[workaholic]> Hiyo
[11:39:40] <R00tk3y> Please send me an example of the response JSON
[11:39:42] <R00tk3y> If you could
[11:39:51] <hlve[workaholic]> it's  post
[11:39:54] <hlve[workaholic]> not a get
[11:39:56] <R00tk3y> Oh ok
[11:40:10] <fission6> systemfault:  agreed, fixed
[11:40:20] <R00tk3y> And its returning seatCount: 6
[11:40:26] <systemfault> fission6: Beside that, it looks go to me.
[11:40:27] <hlve[workaholic]> yes
[11:40:28] <systemfault> *good
[11:40:36] <R00tk3y> Okay, what are you using for SS technology
[11:40:39] <R00tk3y> Php, ASP?
[11:40:44] <fission6> thnaks
[11:40:46] <MistuhKurtz> fission6, You can also do $stations_to_mark.each(function(index, element){ /*... */ }); I also prefer that if I'm iterating over a jquery collection, although your way is perfectly fine. it's just always good to be aware of alternatives :)
[11:40:58] <hlve[workaholic]> I need it to post  ASP
[11:41:00] <hlve[workaholic]> fdsretsn
[11:41:02] <hlve[workaholic]> it's ASP
[11:41:11] <R00tk3y> Okay I dont know ASP well enough but
[11:41:15] <systemfault> R00tk3y: By default, jQuery sends form data.
[11:41:16] <R00tk3y> You should have something like
[11:41:23] <R00tk3y> This is PHP
[11:41:25] <R00tk3y> Bare with me
[11:41:25] <NoiseEee> hlve[workaholic]: if its RETURNING that you should inquire with the script thats RETURNING the data
[11:41:42] <R00tk3y> $someArray['someSeat'] = 6
[11:41:52] <R00tk3y> And then $json_encode($someArray)
[11:42:02] <R00tk3y> And then, in php I would echo $json_encode
[11:42:14] <R00tk3y> echo $json_encode($someArray);
[11:42:26] <R00tk3y> Sorry lol no $ in front of json_encode, its a function
[11:42:52] <phizes> systemfault: if I may bother you for insight, wrt "fission6: The real "meh" in your code" is the problem that it has $(value) 3 times?
[11:42:58] <R00tk3y> http://code.google.com/p/aspjson/
[11:43:23] <R00tk3y> Im not familiar with ASP, so I cannot further assist you
[11:43:28] <hlve[workaholic]> Hmph
[11:43:45] <fission6> phizes  you can do it once
[11:43:54] <fission6> $value = $(value)
[11:44:30] <systemfault> phizes: He did var latitude = $(value).data('lat'); var longitude = $(value).data('long'); var station = $(value).data('station-name'); which wraps "value" 3 times
[11:44:51] <systemfault> phizes: He should have done: var $value = $(value); var latitude = $value.data('lat'); var longitude = $value.data('long'); var station = $value.data('station-name');
[11:44:54] <phizes> fission6: Thanks, I see the error of my ways now, js is far, far from my strong point
[11:45:04] <phizes> systemfault: Thanks to you too
[11:45:38] <MistuhKurtz> phizes, but you did raise a good point
[11:45:39] <fission6> phizes keep asking questions like those
[11:45:48] <MistuhKurtz> ^
[11:50:54] <jaequery> is there any way to detect if an element is clearly visible to the user?  as in there are no other parents hiding/obscuring it, etc ...
[11:51:26] <farmdawgnation> o.O
[11:51:28] <farmdawgnation> What's the use case?
[11:51:50] <jaequery> its for an inline editing tool i'm working on
[11:52:49] <farmdawgnation> No, I mean... heh... what's happening in said tool that has prompted you to ask that question? Seems like you may be trying to work around something being broken instead of addressing an actual problem somewhere.
[11:52:56] <MistuhKurtz> jaequery, $(el).is(':visible');
[11:53:31] <farmdawgnation> MistuhKurtz: That only detects if it is being rendered doesn't it? It'll still return true if something is on top of what you're querying right?
[11:53:34] <MistuhKurtz> or $("div:visible");
[11:53:59] <farmdawgnation> Oh wait. I may have misunderstood the question.
[11:54:11] <jaequery> hm doesn't do anything
[11:54:18] <farmdawgnation> Don't mind me.
[11:54:22] * farmdawgnation returns to coding cave.
[11:54:38] <MistuhKurtz> farmdawgnation, yes that is correct
[11:55:05] <MistuhKurtz> ?:visible @jaequery
[11:55:06] <bot-t> jaequery, :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[11:55:24] <jaequery> doesn't detect if something on top though
[11:55:33] <MistuhKurtz> correct
[11:55:55] <jaequery> im even using .parents().map()  ... and still all indicates it's visible
[11:56:17] <MistuhKurtz> read the documentation to understnad what it does
[11:58:44] <bjmiller> hi, need some assistance with a very basic jquery plugin called html5 sortable (http://farhadi.ir/projects/html5sortable/). just trying to get it to save the values in the order I specify, that's it. if anyone is interested in making some quick money assisting, please message me. US business verified paypal account, etc. Thanks.
[12:00:37] <Tales1> good afternoon
[12:01:15] <bjmiller> anyone?
[12:01:51] <Tales1> i'm trying to upload a file using jquery and php. I hafe an input type file inside a form which triggers an event on change (when file is selected)
[12:03:47] <Tales1> the problem is, when i do: $.post( 'myuploader.php', $('#myform').serialize(), function(data){ alert(data); } ); and i echo $_FILES on myuploader.php, it is empty
[12:04:00] <NoiseEee> Tales1: you can't upload a file over traditional XHR/ajax call
[12:04:18] <Tales1> can anyone help me?
[12:04:18] <NoiseEee> Tales1: either you use html5/xhr2, or check into iframe hacks to simulate XHR uploads
[12:04:36] <Tales1> how can i do it? i found a lot of plugins but i don't know how to handle the upload on the server side
[12:04:41] <NoiseEee> Tales1: you can't upload a file over traditional XHR/ajax call
[12:05:06] <tra> Tales1: files are not included with seralize() if i recall correct
[12:06:25] * NoiseEee wonders if he is invisible
[12:06:31] <Tales1> i mean, i just wish there was a plugin that can send a file to the old upload.php and treat it the same way
[12:06:47] <Tales1> but it looks like i need to lern a new way to code the file uploads
[12:06:52] <Whirl3d> anybody seen NoiseEee lately?
[12:07:04] <systemfault> 2 minutes ago.
[12:07:07] <Tales1> i'm reading you NoiseEee
[12:07:23] * Whirl3d wonders if NoiseEee got the joke
[12:09:00] <misteroneill> Tales1: try this, it works pretty well for asynchronous file uploads: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[12:09:02] <Tales1> so... i want to use for example http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/ or this http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#file-upload better, but i don't know how to write my php file
[12:09:46] <Tales1> yeah, i downloaded it, but when i got to the part where i move my uploaded files to the right place, i didn't know what to code lol
[12:11:03] <hlve[workaholic]> WOOHOO FIREFOX BETA UPDATE
[12:12:26] <veQue> are you being sarcastic?
[12:12:36] <veQue> or really just happy?
[12:18:04] <Vill> hlve[workaholic], last Firefox update just destoryed my favourite Theme, I hate FF Updates
[12:18:19] <katsh> is there a way to send post to another page, without a form?
[12:18:24] <katsh> and without ajax
[12:18:34] <NoiseEee> katsh: not with js, nope
[12:18:35] <Vill> like URL call?
[12:18:49] <katsh> i get variables from a url, and i want to post to them another page
[12:18:59] <NoiseEee> katsh: as in POST or as in send?
[12:19:01] <katsh> right now i am setting them as hidden form fields, and then submitting the form with .submit()
[12:19:04] <Vill> katsh, it all depends on the structure of that page
[12:19:06] <katsh> as in POST
[12:19:12] <NoiseEee> katsh: then no
[12:19:19] <katsh> alright. thanks.
[12:37:43] <medoix> echo json_encode(number_format($balance, 2)); is outputting "1,000,000.00" but then $('#balance').html(JSON.parse(data)); is giving me error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ,
[12:41:24] <NoiseEee> medoix: a) ##php  b) learn how to use json_encode
[12:43:37] <medoix> NoiseEee: well considering it is only one value with no array, is it better or easier to just change the jquery to not read it as JSON and just grab the data?
[12:46:30] <BillCriswell> medoix: Are you doing $.getJSON() or something else?
[12:47:29] <medoix> BillCriswell:
[12:47:33] <Vill> http://jsonlint.com/ <-- Validate your JSON
[12:47:36] <medoix> BillCriswell: http://pastebin.com/CnP1EcSk
[12:47:51] <misteroneill> medoix: a string containing only a number is not json
[12:48:01] <misteroneill> that's why it throws an error
[12:49:11] <medoix> misteroneill: that is what i was saying before, should i work to make it true json or should i change the jquery to just ready the string?
[12:49:35] <BillCriswell> medoix: You don't need to do JSON.parse() on it.
[12:49:54] <alwayslearning> hey can anyone help me troubleshoot whats going on with my site? The jquery is acting funky and not loading http://youngland.com/
[12:50:09] <medoix> BillCriswell: what function do i need?
[12:50:24] <alwayslearning> I see the error UncaughtReference Error: loadpage not defined
[12:50:34] <BillCriswell> medoix: Just do console.log(data) and see what it is.
[12:50:37] <misteroneill> medoix: if you just want to return a string with a number in it, then no function is needed
[12:51:26] <misteroneill> that said, i would standardize on the server-side of my application returning a consistent format (99% of the time, JSON)
[12:51:29] <BillCriswell> alwayslearning: Are you saving as UTF-8 without the BOM?
[12:52:23] <alwayslearning> Bill im not quite sure what you mean, i was editing my footer.php which includes some <script> tags
[12:52:39] <alwayslearning> and now i find myself in a mess because im not worth my salt when it comes to jquery
[12:53:36] <BillCriswell> alwayslearning: I messed up haha.
[12:54:11] <BillCriswell> alwayslearning: You're calling loadpage() before it's defined
[12:54:53] <alwayslearning> how do i definite it? I might start crying soon
[12:55:32] <alwayslearning> @BillCriswell i don't think i touched anything in that part, but thats where the error shows up
[12:55:41] <Conti> JQM question: I am having a problem injecting a div with data-role="popup" into a page dynamically, using .trigger('create') on the function, injecting a lot of other stuff and all that works fine but the popup doesn't - anyone have any ideas?
[12:57:18] <jaequery> does jquery have JSON.parse() built in somewhere?
[12:57:35] <misteroneill> jaequery: no, but more browsers do
[12:57:39] <misteroneill> most*
[12:57:50] <shoky> alwayslearning: remove  the onload="loadpage()" from <body>  and instead , after the function loadpage() {...}  part in the <Script> , put:  $(window).load(loadpage);
[12:57:57] <jaequery> ie8 too?
[12:57:58] <BillCriswell> alwayslearning: The person who commented this code should be fought.
[12:58:08] <shoky> alwayslearning: sorry, or jQuery(window).load(loadpage)  if $  is used for smth else
[12:58:13] <misteroneill> jaequery: i believe IE8 does support JSON
[12:58:18] <veQue> i have a selector $(myselector).bind('click', function(){ //DoThisA //DoThisB //DoThisC });     I want to have another selector $(myselector2).bind('click', function(){ //DoThisB //DoThisC });    everything but DoThisA
[12:58:45] <veQue> seems like a shame to have all that code
[12:58:51] <shoky> veQue:  heard of functions?
[12:59:00] <veQue> shoky: indeed
[12:59:10] <shoky> they let you put lots of code in one block, that you can call from many places..
[12:59:11] <veQue> but i've had problems with them
[12:59:11] <whatever_42> hey. any thoughts on a) why this doesn't work properly on jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/LWGNU/ b) how do i avoid that the slidedown action is performed twice?
[12:59:12] <alpha123> veQue: Make doThisA, doThisB, and doThisC functions.
[12:59:21] <veQue> ok
[12:59:43] <veQue> I had problems making sure my varibles werent local i guess
[12:59:45] <alwayslearning> @Bill i agree @shoky so what line should i be replacing
[12:59:56] <alpha123> veQue: then $(myselector).bind('click', function () {doThisA.call(this);doThisB.call(this);doThisC.call(This);}
[13:00:02] <shoky> whatever_42: you might try including jquery on the left
[13:00:09] <alpha123> veQueThat'll make `this` the same in doThisN
[13:00:14] <BillCriswell> alwayslearning: Adding }); right before </script> might fix it.
[13:00:20] <BillCriswell> But the load issue is still there.
[13:00:22] <BillCriswell> Hold on one second.
[13:00:32] <veQue> alpha ok thanks
[13:00:36] <alpha123> oops... veQue: That'll make `this` the same in doThisA/B/C the same as in the click handler.
[13:00:41] <alpha123> no problem :)
[13:00:50] <whatever_42> ok problem a solved  what about problem b? it does the same thing on jsfiddle and this just looks stupid
[13:01:33] <shoky> alwayslearning: i said 2 changes to make, one to the <body> tag, and another is to add the jQuery(window).load(loadpage) right after  function loadpage() { ... }
[13:01:50] <shoky> alwayslearning: but maybe BillCriswell is onto some other error, donno
[13:02:20] <alwayslearning> @BillCriswell thank you so much dude, its working now!
[13:03:15] <BillCriswell> shoky: The document ready wasn't closed. I still don't get how that loadpage() call isn't throwing an error though
[13:03:32] <BillCriswell> alwayslearning: No problem!
[13:03:54] <Hapzz> what's the easiest way to make table cells editable
[13:04:04] <Hapzz> like, switched to an <input> and then "applied" with some button?
[13:04:17] <veQue> alpha  doThisA = function(){ //doThisA}
[13:04:24] <veQue> ?
[13:04:42] <veQue> that's the one and only way to make named functions in jquery right?
[13:04:54] <shoky> BillCriswell: ah, well onload really runs after the function was already defined
[13:05:12] <BillCriswell> Oh cause it's still in body. Duh.
[13:05:39] <eshlox> http://wklej.org/id/890778/ it's possible to pass this.followersRecipe to function? i need to run this after slideToggle
[13:06:03] <shoky> veQue:  function doThisA() { ... }
[13:06:42] <veQue> shoky: is that an alternate way, or is my way not valid?
[13:07:15] <alpha123> veQue: Your way is valid, but creates an extra global variable. You probably just want function doThisA() { // ... }
[13:07:31] <veQue> ok
[13:07:35] <whatever_42> any thoughts right now on why it does slide down the divs twice http://jsfiddle.net/LWGNU/3/ ?
[13:08:31] <shoky> whatever_42: you're doing .slideUp  on 2 divs, and when each of those 2 animations is complete, you're doing .slideDown() too
[13:09:08] <whatever_42> well but shouldn't slide up do nothing in case the div is insible?
[13:09:47] <shoky> you dont see the animation cause nothing happens, but it still calls the callback when its "done"
[13:09:57] <whatever_42> well ok apparently it doesn't. what am i supposed to change?
[13:10:15] <shoky> i donno, depends exactly what effect you want
[13:10:49] <whatever_42> well i want to be just one div visible at the same time
[13:11:02] <shoky> now that you understand whats going on better, play around with it more
[13:12:16] <whatever_42> ok i am going to try it
[13:12:47] <Cobar> running into an issue where events aren't triggering in jQuery Mobile unless I reload the page first. It won't trigger them if I get to the page from another page
[13:15:25] <shoky> eshlox: here are 2 ways- http://wklej.org/id/890791/
[13:28:38] <eshlox> shoky: ok, thanks ;-)
[13:28:55] <firstclassfunc> why aren't jquery tools very popular?
[13:29:36] <alpha123> firstclassfunc: Do you mean http://jquerytools.org/ or something else?
[13:32:20] <firstclassfunc> alpha123: yes
[13:34:10] <shoky> their documentation page starts with:  Let's face it: do you really need drag-and-drop, resizable windows or sortable lists in your web applications?
[13:34:11] <alpha123> firstclassfunc: Probably because of jQuery UI
[13:34:18] <shoky> that alone is enough to deter me
[13:35:09] <themachine> you should be able to do anything in jquery that you can do in jtools
[13:35:11] <themachine> but not the other way around
[13:35:31] <alpha123> shoky: lol, it does? That's probably the reason then.
[13:36:03] <brandonbuildium> partall
[13:41:12] <firstclassfunc> OK, fair enough
[14:12:43] <firstclassfunc> this chan is dead
[14:15:20] <BillCriswell> It's friday after 5. We're not all complete dorks.
[14:15:47] <scotdb> question about JQuery UI validation ... when a validation takes place "onBlur" and there is a failure the field is blanked out ... is there a way to keep the (invalid) value in place for them to edit ?
[14:15:48] <BillCriswell> Well, assuming EVERYONE is on the east coast.
[14:17:40] <firstclassfunc> it's only 3:17 here
[14:17:57] <scotdb> and its nearly bedtime here in the UK ;-)
[14:18:41] <BillCriswell> I wasn't being serious. I was making a joke aout myself still being here after 5 on a Friday. =(
[14:18:50] <farmdawgnation> BillCriswell: I feel your pain.
[14:19:10] <farmdawgnation> Although, I'm more working because I have nothing better to do til dinner, not because I have to atm. heh
[14:20:48] <freshsun> Hi all(my first time to use irc, so sorry if offend the rules here)
[14:21:06] <MistuhKurtz> 2:21 over here
[14:21:20] <freshsun> I have a question about the following query selector. There is an note:
[14:21:37] <freshsun> Note: The $("> elem", context) selector will be deprecated in a future release. Its usage is thus discouraged in lieu of using alternative selectors.
[14:21:42] <MistuhKurtz> freshsun, just ask the question, no need to announce that you have a question :)
[14:21:59] <MistuhKurtz> wat, context selectors are being deprecated?
[14:22:17] <freshsun> no, i thinks just ("> elem",context)
[14:22:19] <veQue> is event a key term or something?
[14:22:20] <farmdawgnation> That may have been done by Sizzle instead of jQ
[14:22:22] <veQue> 'event'
[14:23:06] <farmdawgnation> veQue: Are you asking if it's a reserved word in JavaScript? If so, then no, it's not. It's acceptable as a variable name and whatnot.
[14:23:16] <veQue> ok
[14:24:35] <freshsun> I met a problem, i have a function that accept a jquery object, and find all it's third level children that is a <tb> cell
[14:25:42] <veQue> i dont know how to make this script i found into a regular function because of the (event) part
[14:27:41] <MistuhKurtz> ?jsfiddle @ veQue
[14:27:41] <freshsun> it's like recursion on a nested tables( i mean there will be another table in current tb cell), i will apply the same function on all tables, from the most inside to most outside
[14:27:41] <bot-t> veQue, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[14:28:16] <MistuhKurtz> freshsun, might be easier to help you with a fiddle as well.
[14:28:41] <freshsun> sure, i will write a sample code now, thanks
[14:28:43] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/JfJMT/
[14:29:11] <veQue> i can add som markup
[14:30:12] <shoky> veQue: $('[data-A]').bind('click', function(event){
[14:30:27] <shoky> just add the event as argument to the callback
[14:30:46] <veQue> ok will try
[14:31:13] <shoky> veQue: or:  $('[data-A]').bind('click', addComma);
[14:31:42] <aghouseh> anyone have issues with jquery ui .sortable('refresh') not allowing you to move newly appended items?
[14:31:53] <veQue> becaus i have more functions in there
[14:34:00] <MistuhKurtz> veQue, http://jsfiddle.net/JfJMT/2/
[14:41:43] <freshsun> Hi, MistuhKurtz, i have my question on http://jsfiddle.net/kunJQ/
[14:43:15] <freshsun> it's about to find the best alternative of $(">elem",context)
[14:43:15] <freshsun> )
[14:43:29] <MistuhKurtz> ah
[14:43:33] <MistuhKurtz> that first > is redundant
[14:43:36] <MistuhKurtz> wati
[14:43:37] <MistuhKurtz> wiat
[14:44:00] <freshsun> no, if i ignore the first > i will find all nested tables
[14:44:51] <veQue> Alright!
[14:44:57] <MistuhKurtz> yeah I came to that realization
[14:44:58] <veQue> shoky MistuhKurtz thanks!
[14:45:15] <MistuhKurtz> freshsun, where did you see this note saying it will be deprecated?
[14:45:24] <veQue> btw alpha123 thanks too btw
[14:45:34] <MistuhKurtz> np
[14:45:34] <freshsun> http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[14:45:50] <freshsun> right up the example part
[14:45:59] <MistuhKurtz> okay
[14:46:01] <MistuhKurtz> well you can either do
[14:46:12] <shoky> $(context).children('elem')
[14:46:22] <MistuhKurtz> $(table).find('>tbody>tr>td>table');
[14:47:54] <MistuhKurtz> yeah, I suppose I would just use that
[14:48:23] <freshsun> great, this is what i wanted
[14:48:43] <freshsun> Thanks MistuhKurtz
[14:48:51] <MistuhKurtz> $(selector, context) is the same as $(context).find(selector);
[14:49:08] <freshsun> i am wondering taht
[14:49:11] <MistuhKurtz> in fact I believe the context selector is just a wrapper for find. I wonder why they're deprecating that
[14:49:45] <freshsun> if $(selector, context) won't be deprecated, and ">elem" is legal selector
[14:50:11] <freshsun> cause it can be used in .find()
[14:50:38] <freshsun> why jQuery will deprecated $(">elem", context)
[14:50:48] <mnus> hello boys
[14:50:53] <MistuhKurtz> yeah idk.
[14:50:57] <mnus> ;)
[14:51:05] <MistuhKurtz> freshsun, do you really need all of those other immediate child selectors?
[14:51:44] <freshsun> i either add different class names to different levels
[14:51:55] <freshsun> or i change my design of the whole page
[14:52:28] <freshsun> i cannot find out other ways to not to use immediate child selectors
[14:52:50] <shoky> immediate child selectors are not being deprecated
[14:53:26] <shoky> o, nevermind
[14:53:44] <mnus> oO
[14:54:36] <shoky> freshsun: adding classes is a good way to do it. doesnt have to be on all levels, just the ones you need to select
[14:55:25] <freshsun> then i need to assign different class name to different layers
[14:55:32] <alperkanat> hey there.. how can i get the HTML output of an jquery object that has multiple element in it?
[14:55:49] <shoky> yea.. dont use the same class name for different types/layers ;p
[14:55:59] <alperkanat> namely an array like this: http://dpaste.com/842742/ -- i want to convert this to HTML
[14:56:00] <freshsun> if i just want to do same task recursively on these layers
[14:57:22] <freshsun> and each time on only one layer, then i will have problem
[14:57:23] <shoky> alperkanat: $('<div/>').append(content).html()
[14:58:22] <freshsun> i can make it .layer1, .layer2, .layer3 and increase the class number as i going deeper
[14:58:41] <freshsun> but might not as clean as an immediate child selector
[14:58:58] <shoky> why name all layers
[14:59:07] <shoky> and why make it .layer1
[14:59:10] <shoky> give it a descriptive name..
[14:59:43] <shoky> you wanna get that table  thats in the <td> .. so give just that <table> some class..  .myCoolTable
[15:02:01] <freshsun> i am making the nested table filter, the outer table will be hide when all table inside it hide. so I need to deal the most inside one first. and i don't know how many layers will have. (actually at most four, but i just want to make it generic)
[15:02:36] <Prashles> I <3 ajpiano
[15:03:35] <ajpiano> ok
[15:03:35] <ajpiano> :)
[15:04:59] <freshsun> does jQuery will deprecate .find(">element")?
[15:06:36] <MistuhKurtz> I don't think so freshsun
[15:07:46] <freshsun> i see, thanks MistuhKurtz~
[15:09:00] <hugo_moss> hello im trying to use a child selector like this combined with .on(), .off():   $( .someclass > ul > li ).on( function( evt){ $(.someclass(the same)).off(); do stuff here; $(.someclass(thesame)).on(); });
[15:09:29] <hugo_moss> the problem is it works the first time when i use it, but i think its not getting turned back on because the listener doesnt listen to events
[15:09:42] <hugo_moss> am i doing anything wrong?
[15:11:28] <chovy> how do i get the first $items = $("ul").find('li');
[15:11:34] <chovy> i want the first item in $items
[15:11:48] <chovy> $items[0].width() says undefined
[15:14:51] <freshsun> $("ul").find('li').first().width()?
[15:15:16] <freshsun> $("ul").find('li:first').width()?
[15:15:36] <mnus> o.O
[15:18:40] <Cobar> running into an issue where events aren't triggering in jQuery Mobile unless I reload the page first. It won't trigger them if I get to the page from another page
[15:27:27] <hugo_moss> ok im trying to detach a handler once the handler is executed, and then let it do some animation, and then re-attach the handler with .on/.off, my code works when i remove the .on/.off switching, i think im doing something wrong. for some reason when i detach the handler and try to reattach, it never reattaches
[15:27:36] <hugo_moss> anyone have any idea
[15:32:42] <hugo_moss> lol silly me
[15:32:44] <hugo_moss> i got it
[15:32:54] <hugo_moss> thanks, for nothin jk
[15:36:51] <chovy> freshsun: how do i get an arbitryar number

[15:37:49] <coder7of9> i am now finding errors. what is teh best way to sort this out. slider, scrollable
[15:38:31] <shoky> coder7of9: you definitely don't need jquery-ui twice..
[15:38:32] <freshsun> chovy: what's your meaning
[15:38:59] <coder7of9> i think the custom one has something extra from the developer.
[15:39:18] <shoky> coder7of9: great.. how do you expect us to help with that
[15:39:22] <coder7of9> what a mess. i will have to piecethis puzzle together.
[15:40:11] <coder7of9> arn't you Gods or something? magic words.
[15:40:27] <coder7of9> mere angels.
[15:40:50] <shoky> hint: start with the first error
[15:43:21] <coder7of9> is there an order. base, ui, tools for example
[15:44:03] <MistuhKurtz> that's the order I would probably include them in coder7of9
[15:45:00] <coder7of9> thx

[15:52:50] <nazario> anyone can help. Why wont this select? $(window).load(function(){
[15:54:13] <nazario> returns null
[15:56:50] <coder7of9> ah. just missing a library and had to remove another. Thanks!!!
[16:00:26] <nazario> anyone please? I am about to chuck my brains out
[16:01:07] <xec_> nazario: what are you trying to do?
[16:01:17] <nazario> something simple
[16:01:20] <nazario> $(window).load(function(){
[16:01:31] <nazario> returns null cannot sellect the item
[16:01:58] <xec_> i see your code, and you use the word "select" but i dont know what you're trying to do
[16:02:35] <nazario> it gives me the error TypeError: Cannot call method 'cycle' of null
[16:03:34] <xec_> that doesn't make much sense. do you have a live url?
[16:03:35] <phizes> paste?

[16:10:33] <s34n> what would cause a jq-mobile radio button to stop responding to change events?
[16:14:33] <s34n> This is pretty strange. I click on the radio button and nothing happens. I refresh the page, and the button shows selected.
[16:16:00] <s34n> Before the refresh it should be selected. After the refresh it should not be.

[16:59:09] <naeluh> Hi I was looking for a way to remove and replace a div when on a mobile device I am using http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/ but cant quite get the jquery right this is what I have so far this just replaces everytime no matter what
[16:59:19] <naeluh> opps heres the code http://pastie.org/5496654
[16:59:56] <MistuhKurtz> naeluh, remove it completely? or replace it with something else?
[17:00:09] <naeluh> MistuhKurtz: replace it
[17:00:12] <MistuhKurtz> you can use media queries to set the display property
[17:00:12] <naeluh> thanks
[17:02:02] <naeluh> MistuhKurtz: yeah I guess that could work for sure is there a way to do it with jquery so it only shows up on phones prob I guess the device media query would work for that too
[17:03:41] <MistuhKurtz> naeluh, better to use media queries than UA sniffing
[17:03:41] <MistuhKurtz> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/
[17:11:42] <naeluh> MistuhKurtz: thanks for the tips I appreciate the help

[17:15:39] <dns-away> anyone know whether such plugin like a github 'effect like file/folder  onChange:event'

[17:23:23] <MistuhKurtz> MeMReS, can you be more specific
[17:28:27] <xec_> MeMReS: setTimeout is included in vanilla js http://vanilla-js.com/
[17:34:11] <dns-away> one question
[17:34:57] <dns-away> If I have 4 divs with same class, how I can select 2th class ?
[17:38:19] <xec_> $(".className").eq(1) i think
[17:38:25] <MistuhKurtz> dns-away, $(".class:eq(1)")
[17:38:46] <MistuhKurtz> oh actually I think I like it better how xec_ wrote it :33
[17:38:47] <dns-away> ok
[17:38:51] <dns-away> thanks -)
[17:40:42] <MistuhKurtz> iirc I think selector methods are generally faster than selector strings because the strings have to be parsed with regex. the native querySelectorAll method has greatly sped that up but I'm sure they still need to parse the string with regex first to make sure there aren't any non-native supported selectors in there
[17:42:38] <jrivera_> m
[17:51:45] <DaniG2k> guys I'm trying to have a checkbox field with a hidden div that fades into appearance when the checkbox is ticked
[17:51:56] <DaniG2k> I have the basic jQuery down for this but
[17:52:11] <DaniG2k> I want to check on page load that the box isn't already checked or not
[17:53:47] <DaniG2k> my code looks like this
[17:53:52] <DaniG2k> http://bpaste.net/show/QvSVbKSZpi9DVatGlnEf/
[17:54:13] <DaniG2k> however, if there are errors with the form, I'd like the form to show
[17:54:28] <DaniG2k> I don't know how to fix this
[17:57:12] <veQue> do i even need a $(document).ready(function()  ?
[17:58:15] <MistuhKurtz> yes veQue
[17:58:52] <MistuhKurtz> veQue, javascript will start executing as soon as it's been downloaded, even if the rest of the HTML document hasn't finished downloading
[17:59:05] <veQue> trying to get my jquery app to work in phonegap ...
[17:59:12] <MistuhKurtz> so if your javascript is trying to manipulate parts of the DOM that dont' exist yet (because you haven't waited for dom ready) then it will fail
[17:59:20] <veQue> somewhat unsuccessful
[17:59:45] <defaultro> hey folks. I want to overlay another div on top of a div with an id of id="target". What would be the code to put another div on top of target?
[17:59:50] <veQue> MistuhKurtz:  so am i better off just wrapping everything in it?
[18:00:04] <MistuhKurtz> that's generally the best practice
[18:00:08] <MistuhKurtz> depends what your code does
[18:00:13] <MistuhKurtz> is it a plugin? then no
[18:00:20] <veQue> no plugins
[18:00:51] <schofld> how do you make jquery return the exact same thing as "document.getElementById("elid")"
[18:00:55] <veQue> i've moved the closing }); of it upwards in my .js and had gotten some improvements
[18:01:17] <DrDank> Anyone used simpleModal? --- Once I displayed the dialog.. and close it.. then open it back up the <h2>tag</h2> Isn't displayed but everything else is?? Any suggestions?
[18:01:20] <aghouseh> schofld: $('#element')[0]
[18:01:23] <veQue> got rid of it and terribleness happened
[18:01:35] <schofld> aghouseh: will try
[18:03:52] <schofld> aghouseh: FUCKING A had forgotten how to do that... now my file upload works
[18:04:11] <aghouseh> that is excellent news
[18:05:06] <DrDank> Anyone used simpleModal? --- Once I displayed the dialog.. and close it.. then open it back up the <h2>tag</h2> Isn't displayed but everything else is?? Any suggestions? --- example: http://drdank.web44.net
[18:05:51] <aghouseh> hah
[18:05:55] <aghouseh> well, i see cufon
[18:06:02] <aghouseh> thats about as far as im willing to go
[18:06:09] <aghouseh> guessing it has something to do with that
[18:08:30] <DrDank> or can someone help me code a function that notices when the dialog has been closed?
[18:09:41] <aghouseh> DrDank: i would really ditch cufon unless you are totally in love with it
[18:10:49] <DrDank> aghouseh, I have no idea what cufon is.. lol -- Im just learning.. using a template for the under construction page
[18:11:33] <aghouseh> yeah, thats an older method of using canvas to draw text elements with a custom font
[18:11:48] <aghouseh> @font-face is the way now
[18:11:48] <b-ot> aghouseh, memorised “font-face”.
[18:11:52] <aghouseh> bot what
[18:11:56] <DrDank> aghouseh, Gotcha.
[18:12:59] <DrDank> aghouseh, Got any ideas on my problem? :-\
[18:13:14] <aghouseh> honestly, i think it IS related to the cufon.
[18:13:30] <DrDank> how would I remove cufon? -- i dont see a cufon.js ?
[18:13:32] <aghouseh> if you're dead set with trying to solve it as-is, i would google "simplemodal cufon problem"
[18:13:40] <aghouseh> well, thats going to mess up your fonts
[18:13:54] <DrDank> sorry but like I said total newbie.. just trying to get under constr. template to work the way I want (while editing/customizing)
[18:14:12] <DrDank> nevermind, I seen it
[18:14:58] <DrDank> aghouseh, that was the problem. Thank you! :)
[18:15:06] <aghouseh> no prob! gl
[18:16:25] <MistuhKurtz> you're gonna need to call cufon refresh
[18:16:42] <MistuhKurtz> but cufon is kind of antiquated now. better off just dropping it probably
[18:26:37] <jrockjiggz> I'm trying to upgrade to 1.8, i'm getting data from an element <a href="..." data-tabId="name">  then selecting $(this).data('tabId') but getting undefined
[18:26:53] <jrockjiggz> it worked fine before
[18:31:34] <jrockjiggz> really..
[18:32:17] <jrockjiggz> it binds fine, i can console.log the element, the element clearly has data-tabId="settingsBasicInformation"  but $(this).data('tabId') return undefined
[18:32:39] <aghouseh> are you confusing i and L
[18:32:43] <aghouseh> hehe
[18:33:34] <aghouseh> try using data-tab-id=""
[18:33:59] <aghouseh> i think jq does something with the data key.. auto camel and uncamelcases or something
[18:34:05] <jrockjiggz> ohh, turns out tabId="" is only detected with data('tabid') <-- lowercase
[18:34:11] <aghouseh> yea
[18:34:31] <aghouseh> i think if you get data('tabId') it checks for "data-tab-id" as the attrib
[18:34:34] <jrockjiggz> so data-tabId=""  === $(this).data('tabid')
[18:34:52] <jrockjiggz> it seems to lowercase the attr..
[18:34:54] <jrockjiggz> but thanks

[19:02:45] <jrockjiggz> shoky: thanks.. its interesting, before it would clear the value, now it depends on that attr..
[19:04:53] <jrockjiggz> it works with 1.5, not with 1.6 -- somethin changed
[19:05:31] <shoky> .attr changed
[19:05:34] <shoky> stop using attr
[19:05:36] <shoky> use .data()
[19:05:39] <shoky> and data-XXX attributes
[19:05:45] <shoky> for stuff you wanna pu on the HTML tags
[19:05:48] <jrockjiggz> yea, a lot of code to upgrade that is all
[19:06:02] <shoky> also dont do .attr('value'  for sure..
[19:06:06] <shoky> value is a property
[19:06:15] <shoky> not an attribute. the important one anway
[19:06:20] <shoky> use .val(...)
[19:06:24] <shoky> for changing/reading value
[19:06:48] <jrockjiggz> shoky: prop() fixes the issue.. dont know if upgrade is safe todo now haha
[19:07:05] <shoky> probably not
[19:09:03] <shoky> jrockjiggz: ahh
[19:09:13] <shoky> i forgot that defaultValue is a real property name
[19:09:21] <shoky> so yes definitely use .prop for that one ;]
[19:09:37] <shoky> there is really no reason to use .attr for anything hardly
[19:09:50] <shoky> only if another plugin/API specifically requires tehre to be an _attribute_
[19:17:07] <neelpulse> In https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/architecture-examples/backbone/js/views/app.js#L3 is there any significance of $ passed as a parameter to the function?
[19:19:38] <shoky> neelpulse: in this specific case, no, because you can see that jQuery is already being referenced as $, outside of that function (in the same line)
[19:20:30] <neelpulse> shoky, okay thanks.
[19:20:33] <shoky> neelpulse: but in general, the global jQuery object is passed as that first argument to the DOM ready handler
[19:21:21] <shoky> so many times you'll see similar code but it'd be like:   jQuery(function($) { .... })
[19:21:50] <shoky> if $ is being globally used for something else, then it IS significant here
[19:22:22] <neelpulse> Okay. Very informative. thank you
[19:23:20] <abjorn> what up playas
[19:38:54] <jrockjiggz> anyone know why $('#one, #two, ') gives syntax error?  (the last , causes this)
[19:42:37] <shoky> because it's expecting another selector..?
[19:42:43] <shoky> similar to..
[19:42:51] <shoky> ?eval console.log('lol', )
[19:42:54] <bot-t> shoky: SyntaxError: syntax error
[19:43:30] <shoky> it's jquery throwing the error though, not JS
[19:46:02] <jrockjiggz> that would make snese
[19:46:06] <jrockjiggz> sense
[19:47:30] <garbagecollectio> how does jquery use $
[19:47:33] <garbagecollectio> like what is that'
[19:47:35] <garbagecollectio> is that a function?
[19:47:59] <garbagecollectio> $(params).whattodo
[19:48:25] <garbagecollectio> how is that structured on the jquery code
[19:52:01] <jrockjiggz> $('form').prop('action') is retuning an object <input name="action"> this doesnt make sense?
[19:52:43] <coldhead> is there actually an input with that name in the form?
[19:53:58] <jrockjiggz> coldhead: yes
[19:54:03] <jrockjiggz> http://jsfiddle.net/9F7be/
[19:54:25] <jrockjiggz> I was looking for the form's action=""
[19:54:47] <coldhead> that might be a DOM quirk rather than a jquery bug
[19:55:02] <coldhead> do you get different results if you use attr() instead of prop()
[19:55:07] <jrockjiggz> yes
[19:55:12] <jrockjiggz> attr will return the url
[19:55:32] <jrockjiggz> in the fiddle, attr works, prop does not
[19:55:52] <coldhead> i dimly remember forms do weird things with elements that have formy names
[19:56:04] <coldhead> ditto for submit, i think
[19:56:30] <jrockjiggz> i wonder if prop has some other side effects
[19:56:58] <coldhead> gnarf would know
[19:58:24] <aghouseh> whats the advantage of prop() over attr()?
[19:58:46] <aghouseh> ah
[19:59:58] <coldhead> http://ejohn.org/blog/jquery-16-and-attr/
[20:00:18] <coldhead> i never use prop() and i get by
[20:00:52] <jrockjiggz> trying to switch up to 1.8
[20:01:24] <jrockjiggz> attr was giving me issues on a few plugins, where prop fixed
[20:09:45] <jrockjiggz> shoky: interesting, According to the latest Element data-* attributes spec, all html attributes are lowercased automatically. In fact, capitol letters are forbidden
[20:13:18] <coldhead> that seems hasrsh
[20:13:22] <coldhead> harsh*
[20:14:21] <gnarf> ?g domlint @jrockjiggz
[20:14:22] <bot-t> jrockjiggz, DOMLint - Test suite against HTML/DOM conflicts - http://kangax.github.com/domlint/
[20:14:54] <gnarf> Names of form controls are populated as properties of "parent" form element and might conflict with "actual" properties of a form element (either own or inherited via "interface chain")
[20:15:13] <gnarf> so when you have a name/id of submit, you can't call .submit()
[20:15:23] <gnarf> because .submit is the HTMLInputElement
[20:16:23] <coldhead> praise be upon ye, gnarf <3

[21:56:59] <defaultro> wroathe, it worked but I was under the impression it's going to be transparent. It wasn't

[22:07:54] <shoky> <coldhead> DrDank: lots of people just use http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ rather than reinvent the wheel
[22:22:55] <DrDank> shoky, You had any experience with that??
[22:27:32] <aqeel> hi room
[22:38:36] <shoky> DrDank: haven't used it myself, just helped others use it a few times ;P
[22:55:11] <r1card> guys, I apply two .css() commands one after another to an element, and I think it applies both at once, while I want them applied one after the other.
[22:55:18] <DrDank> shoky, Well could ya help me use it? I cant get it to work for nothing.. :(
[22:55:23] <r1card> What should I add inbetween to achieve that?
[22:55:48] <donburks> r1card: How much time do you want to have in between?
[22:56:06] <systemfault> r1card: Doesn't make sense… tell us what you are expecting
[22:56:21] <r1card> donburks, basically zero. But I don't want them applied together as a single style change. There's a transition, and it doesn't happen at all.
[22:56:44] <r1card> systemfault, css( { setup initial transform }) .css ( { transition + final transform } )
[22:56:54] <donburks> r1card: Technically it's not happening as a single one, unless you grouped them as an object passed to a single CSS call. They're just happening too fast for you to see them.
[22:57:17] <r1card> donburks, negative, the transition is 2 seconds, and it doesn't happen. I use CSS transitions.
[22:57:29] <r1card> ok let me be more detailed.
[22:57:56] <r1card> css({opacity: 0}).css({transition: 'all 2s ease', opacity: 1}) <-- doesn't work
[22:58:03] <r1card> It goes to opacity 1 sharp
[22:58:15] <r1card> of course, I also supply the prefixes needed for "transition"
[22:58:29] <systemfault> Then add transition with opacity: 0?
[22:58:38] <donburks> r1card: Right. Because you're telling it to transition for 2s, but immediately setting the opacity to 1.
[22:58:53] <donburks> r1card: You need to wait two seconds before you set the opacity to 1, or let the transition do it itself.
[22:58:59] <r1card> donburks, that's how it works in CSS in principle
[22:59:16] <r1card> no, if I don't tell it to what to transition to how would it transition?
[22:59:17] <donburks> r1card: The important words there being 'in principle'
[22:59:42] <r1card> donburks, it works if I apply it directly with style.cssText so jQuery definitely does something different
[23:00:02] <r1card> I suspect it combines both css commands
[23:00:30] <systemfault> r1card: Move the "transition" to the first .css call...
[23:01:07] <r1card> systemfault, I'll try but this will be odd, as it's against the CSS transition spec
[23:01:20] <systemfault> HMm… no?
[23:01:29] <systemfault> That's how transitions work.
[23:01:40] <r1card> yes. The style you have the transition in defines the "target" values.
[23:01:42] <systemfault> The trigger isn't the "transition" property
[23:01:43] <sheilablackrose> hi guys can someone help me with retriving values from a table
[23:01:49] <systemfault> It's the property change
[23:03:15] <donburks> sheilablackrose: I can try.
[23:03:18] <r1card> systemfault,  didn't help
[23:03:36] <sheilablackrose> tq please c this link http://forums.asp.net/t/1864440.aspx/1?Getting+value+from+table+
[23:04:33] <r1card> systemfault, donburks, what fixed it is calling the second CSS with 1/1000s timeout.
[23:04:43] <r1card> systemfault, donburks, which confirms jQuery merges both calls otherwise.
[23:04:51] <r1card> How do I force them separate without silly timeouts
[23:05:00] <sheilablackrose> its a dynamicly created rows with one column tht has dynamicly created checkbox
[23:05:32] <donburks> sheilablackrose: Okay, so at what point do you want to find the checkboxes? On a button click, after it's loaded?
[23:06:36] <sheilablackrose> its like this when the page loads it popultaed a row of documents which has a checkbox created from the flagtable
[23:06:36] <systemfault> r1card: Perhaps by using classes instead of inline CSS (Not 100% sure)
[23:07:05] <sheilablackrose> so when i click a button i want to get the id as ell as the checkboxes id n values n send it to my controller
[23:08:07] <systemfault> r1card: Something like http://jsfiddle.net/PFdQP/
[23:10:34] <r1card> systemfault, classes works, but I need to supply the styles at runtime.
[23:11:01] <r1card> systemfault, I think there was something to "flush" jquery's queue of operations.
[23:11:09] <r1card> I remember vaguely reading about it
[23:11:15] <systemfault> r1card: It works for animations
[23:11:22] <systemfault> Applying CSS is synchronous
[23:12:42] <r1card> systemfault, so 1 ms timeout is the best way..?
[23:13:11] <systemfault> r1card: Do you need to set the transition property at runtime? Or just the style
[23:13:42] <systemfault> Example… Something like that http://jsfiddle.net/PFdQP/1/
[23:14:05] <systemfault> I'm modifying the style directly.. but since the transition is already there, it works.
[23:15:05] <r1card> systemfault, that's not my problem, my problem is I do this in one go:   set start values, set transition, set end values.
[23:15:15] <r1card> The browsers gets all this in one pass and it results in no animation
[23:15:30] <mike029> hi everyone, this is a pretty basic question, hopefully someone can help me out.  im looking to have a function go, but not execute something until a variable has a value of 1. i know it involves something with if else and return but im not sure of how to piece it all together.
[23:15:36] <r1card> unless I add the mentioned 1ms delay
[23:16:04] <systemfault> r1card: I don't see any alternative :/
[23:16:05] <shoky> 0ms delay works too
[23:16:15] <mike029> basically i want a function to wait until a nice little animation thing is done. at the end of the animation i can set a variable to 1 then i want the data function to go off as planned
[23:16:47] <systemfault> 0…1… 2… who cares, JS timers have an awful precision
[23:16:54] <shoky> it just needs to give back control to the UI for a sec, to actually process the css change of opacity:0 or someshit
[23:17:14] <obert> hi do you know a snow falling plugin that doesnt eat ram?
[23:17:35] <coder7of9> the docs say: Scrolling using navigational buttons, API calls, keyboard arrow keys, and the mouse scroll whee
[23:17:35] <mike029> obert try css3
[23:17:37] <r1card> shoky, oh
[23:17:48] <coder7of9> i need to turn off arrow keys. how please
[23:17:50] <r1card> shoky, what does the spec say about 0ms timeouts
[23:17:51] <obert> nothing in jquery^
[23:18:00] <obert> mike029: nothing in jquery?
[23:18:02] <mike029> jquery will eat all your ram :-)
[23:18:08] <coder7of9> :(
[23:18:17] <obert> how come
[23:18:24] <coder7of9> iterations
[23:18:27] <shoky> r1card: 0ms timeouts are very common in web pages to take care of such issues with things being .. too synchronous :P
[23:18:39] <mike029> there's something in css3 now for animations that has 'indefinite' for duration now
[23:18:43] <mike029> plus its actually much easier
[23:18:54] <obert> css3 isnt that supported
[23:19:05] <shoky> r1card: it's basically not a timeout.. it just says to the browser: "hey, do this later sometime"
[23:19:06] <r1card> shoky, thanks :)
[23:19:22] <mike029> obert, depends on who the site is for
[23:19:24] <shoky> or, not sometime, but ASAP, just not now ;]
[23:19:34] <obert> mike029: every people:p
[23:19:36] <mike029> firefox and chrome are updated automatically now, ie8-9 do okay
[23:20:09] <obert> indeed
[23:20:25] <mike029> but jquery will eat your ram because it will keep executing functions over and over for the animation on each and every snowflake pretty much
[23:20:28] <mike029> if im not mistaken
[23:20:58] <mike029> obert
[23:20:58] <mike029> http://csswizardry.com/demos/snow/
[23:21:18] <mike029> seems far easier than hacking jquery into place
[23:21:19] <shoky> if executing functions over and over would eat up ram..
[23:21:31] <shoky> we wouldn't be having this chat
[23:21:54] <mike029> it just seems wasteful though
[23:21:57] <shoky> if something is leaked while executing those functions, then maybe some ram will be eaten ;p
[23:22:34] <mike029> like a poorly coded plugin for snowflakes?
[23:22:35] <DrDank> shoky, Could you help me with this validation? --- im ngetting no where.
[23:23:06] <shoky> DrDank: really dont feel like digging into validation code now, sry
[23:23:12] <shoky> also going to sleep in a bit
[23:23:16] <DrDank> alright, thanks anyway.
[23:23:30] <shoky> but uh post the link here, maybe others will help
[23:23:44] <obert> mike029: http://designshack.net/articles/css/make-it-snow-on-your-website-with-css-keyframe-animations/ this one perhaps?
[23:24:10] <mike029> obert, looking at that page i sent you, you could just use jquery to draw the spans, might be easier
[23:24:41] <obert> ie10
[23:25:07] <obert> oh thanks didint noticed the link
[23:25:34] <mike029> this one looks a little.....stiff??
[23:25:47] <obert> no idea
[23:25:57] <mike029> it looks nice though, maybe hack it up to change the direction of some of them
[23:26:04] <mike029> or mix the two
[23:27:01] <obert> mike029: so-so, only ie10 support, seems
[23:27:05] <mike029> tweak the "back" ones to make them blurrier on the one i sent you, use the css from yours to do that
[23:27:07] <mike029> ?
[23:27:11] <mike029> it opens fine for me in chrome
[23:27:41] <obert> i'll check which ie version my users are using
