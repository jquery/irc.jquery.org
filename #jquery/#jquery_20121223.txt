[03:34:18] <Flayks> Hey! I have a problem with duplicate ajax calls on my website‚Ä¶ i know why but i don't know how to avoid it : http://projets.flayks.com/enz/lockfactory/
[03:35:02] <Flayks> if you click on any link on the menu one time, then another time, it runs x1 ajax call‚Ä¶ x2 ajax calls‚Ä¶ x4 ajax calls‚Ä¶ etc
[03:39:13] <martisj> How do i disable animations on a single instance of toggle()?
[04:39:57] <rstacruz> whats up, #jquery!

[04:50:00] <AQEEL> hi channel
[04:51:42] <rindolf> AQEEL: hi.
[04:56:38] <AQEEL> any one care to give me time for my plugin
[04:58:13] <Flayks> I have a problem with duplicate ajax calls on my website‚Ä¶ i know why but i don't know how to avoid it : http://projets.flayks.com/enz/lockfactory/
[05:02:54] <AQEEL> see ajax of jqury and get over your problem
[05:03:13] <AQEEL> search ajax under documentatiopn
[05:03:28] <AQEEL> documentation*
[05:08:20] <Flayks> AQEEL, i know precisely why i have this duplicate requests‚Ä¶
[05:10:22] <AQEEL> then how come you do not know or cannot solve it
[05:10:58] <AQEEL> you just need to put a barrier so your problem can be resolved.
[05:11:37] <Flayks> AQEEL XD
[05:11:39] <Flayks> i found it
[05:11:55] <Flayks> just need to unbind the click and rebind to avoid the duplicates
[05:12:51] <AQEEL> why not use on
[05:12:59] <AQEEL> then when needed will bind...
[05:13:01] <Flayks> this is why i have duplicates
[05:13:13] <AQEEL> no need for double or use one()
[05:13:42] <AQEEL> if on() gives double use one()
[05:14:04] <Flayks> AQEEL, it gives always a double with one, on or live
[05:14:29] <AQEEL> ?.one()
[05:14:30] <bot-t> .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[05:14:48] <AQEEL> may be your code is wrong then....else why double
[05:15:02] <AQEEL> use stop propagation
[05:16:19] <AQEEL> http://api.jquery.com/event.isImmediatePropagationStopped/
[05:16:21] <AQEEL> http://api.jquery.com/event.isPropagationStopped/

[05:16:25] <AQEEL> http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[06:03:49] <sheilablackrose> what is wrong with this syntax. withot the checked attribute i get the correct count for all teh checkbox type. $mainCheckBox.closest('tr').nextAll('tr').find(".wealthSubCheckBox").is(":checked");
[06:05:32] <FesterCluck> sheilablackrose: Are you counting indeterminate as checked?
[06:06:35] <FesterCluck> Also, are you sure they all have that class?
[06:08:10] <sheilablackrose> yes about th eclass
[06:08:13] <sheilablackrose> the class
[06:08:20] <sheilablackrose> all checkboxes im trying to get has that class
[06:08:45] <sheilablackrose> when i do  $mainCheckBox.closest('tr').nextAll('tr').find(".wealthSubCheckBox") i get the total check boxes
[06:09:10] <FesterCluck> Can you make me a jsfiddle right quick?
[06:09:48] <sheilablackrose> ok let me try
[06:10:20] <FesterCluck> sheilablackrose: If you are calling that method when you are actually checking the checkbox, it's possible it's catching 1 of them during the mousedown  event, and instead you should be hooking the mouseup
[06:11:52] <sheilablackrose> i cnt recreate it cuz everything is dynamic but i pasted the codes i wrote the first one works fine, the second one first if works but the else is the problem
[06:11:53] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/NqFas/
[06:13:41] <sheilablackrose> the first part im doing is when u check the main all its sub get check n when u uncheck it unchecks all
[06:13:49] <FesterCluck> Ok, sheilablackrose: It's the event you are using
[06:13:52] <sheilablackrose> the second part first if is when u uncheck one uncheck its main
[06:13:52] <FesterCluck> Don't use click()
[06:14:03] <FesterCluck> use on("mouseup",function() {
[06:14:22] <sheilablackrose> oh why ,puseup?
[06:14:38] <FesterCluck> The events are firing earlier than you think they are
[06:14:40] <sheilablackrose> mouseup
[06:14:43] <FesterCluck> thus the counting problems
[06:14:44] <sheilablackrose> ic
[06:15:01] <sheilablackrose> ok i should use it for all
[06:15:02] <sheilablackrose> ?
[06:15:16] <FesterCluck> In this case, yes
[06:15:33] <sheilablackrose> could u add it to the code
[06:15:37] <sheilablackrose> im not sure gow to use it
[06:15:41] <FesterCluck> Any time you are attempting to hook "checking the box", use mouseup
[06:16:37] <FesterCluck> http://jsfiddle.net/NqFas/1/
[06:16:39] <FesterCluck> There you go
[06:16:48] <sheilablackrose> thank you i will test it n c
[06:33:28] <sheilablackrose> there is something seriously wrong with my code
[06:33:35] <sheilablackrose> FesterCluck you there buddy
[06:33:35] <sheilablackrose> ?
[06:37:04] <FesterCluck> yeah
[06:37:47] <FesterCluck> Whatup shennyg
[06:37:49] <FesterCluck> sheilablackrose
[06:43:05] <sheilablackrose> well the code didnt work even with th emouseup
[06:43:09] <sheilablackrose> but i manage to get it to work
[06:43:21] <sheilablackrose> but i just dont understand why its working n why the othe rmethot didt work
[06:43:31] <sheilablackrose> the method where i use input type n the value checked
[06:43:38] <sheilablackrose> ill paste it
[06:43:39] <sheilablackrose> hang on
[06:44:05] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/NqFas/2/
[06:44:09] <sheilablackrose> its working fine
[06:44:14] <sheilablackrose> just want to know why n where i went wrong
[06:44:21] <sheilablackrose> n if there is a simpler way of doing it
[06:48:49] <FesterCluck> Ok, so quick review here
[06:48:55] <FesterCluck> From the looks of it:
[06:49:19] <FesterCluck> This is a script to control child check boxes
[06:49:47] <FesterCluck> It's used to check/uncheck all child check boxes when parent is checked,
[06:50:06] <FesterCluck> and also to check/uncheck parent as all child checkboxes become checked, right?
[06:52:25] <FesterCluck> I think the first problem is that you're trying to handle all these different interactions in 1 event handler
[06:54:56] <rindolf> sheilablackrose: your post does not contain the HTML.
[06:55:07] <rindolf> sheilablackrose: you seem more and more like a troll to me.
[07:02:54] <sheilablackrose> ok
[07:03:03] <sheilablackrose> yup
[07:03:22] <sheilablackrose> rindolf this was like fully dynamic
[07:03:36] <sheilablackrose> i manage to do most of it myslef
[07:04:01] <sheilablackrose> just that im wondering why it worked when logically the input[type='checkbox']:checked") ahould have worked
[07:04:16] <sheilablackrose> n im not a troll :)
[07:04:47] <sheilablackrose> im learning
[07:06:34] <sheilablackrose> <FesterCluck>  you mean on th eclick function?
[07:14:09] <FesterCluck> working on your code
[07:15:10] <sheilablackrose> thnks
[07:16:27] <Flayks> join #css
[07:16:33] <Flayks> :x
[07:48:28] <FesterCluck> hmmm
[07:48:35] <FesterCluck> sheilablackrose
[07:48:44] <FesterCluck> prolly the best I can get it for now
[07:51:18] <sheilablackrose> yup
[07:51:28] <FesterCluck> sheilablackrose: This would be a lot easier with your html added in as well
[07:51:38] <FesterCluck> you use .closest() to get to the subcheckboxes
[07:51:41] <sheilablackrose> yeah i know im sorry
[07:51:49] <FesterCluck> closest() traverses UP the dom tree
[07:51:54] <FesterCluck> was that intentional?
[07:52:15] <sheilablackrose> i thought closes briing it out of the checkbox field
[07:52:16] <sheilablackrose> ?
[07:52:51] <sheilablackrose> its a table tht calls a 2 rows
[07:52:58] <sheilablackrose> 1st row is the main
[07:53:03] <sheilablackrose> second is sub
[07:53:15] <sheilablackrose> sub thn calls a table within its row
[07:53:20] <sheilablackrose> which im not doing yet
[07:54:03] <sheilablackrose> oh the sub row could b a couple of rows

[08:33:22] <shoky> pojo: we can hear you
[08:37:37] <shoky> pojo: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas/Drawing_DOM_objects_into_a_canvas
[08:37:49] <shoky> pojo: 2nd line: You can't just draw HTML into a canvas. Instead, you need to use an SVG image containing the content you want to render. To draw HTML content, you'd use a <foreignObject> element containing the HTML, then draw that SVG image into your canvas.
[08:37:59] <shoky> so: you should use canvas AND svg.
[08:40:57] <Duffman> Hello, I'm new to this channel and I don't see any rules in the topic so if I'm doing something wrong, please let me now. I have a question for you guys. I am working on a webapp that uses flapjax, node JS, socket.io and I need jquery UI behaviour for some parts. I started implementing the jquery part, more concretely I needed this effect: http://jqueryui.com/hide/
[08:42:27] <Duffman> so I plugged it into my webapp and it is more or less working, but if I want to use the $ to refer to an id, I have to put a '#' in front of the id name. For example if I want to refer to a control with the id 'rooms' (which is an ordinary html <select>) I have to refer to it like this: $('#rooms')
[08:43:08] <Duffman> why is that? If I look into the source code of the "hide"-effect, I see they also need to put a # in front of the id of "effect"
[08:43:32] <shoky> Duffman: have you learned any jquery?
[08:43:36] <Duffman> but why is this the case, and is there anything I can do to use the old way of referring to id's (eg. $('rooms'))
[08:43:45] <Duffman> this is the first time I'm using it
[08:43:49] <shoky> Duffman: that's not the old way of referring to id's
[08:44:02] <shoky> Duffman:  $('rooms') looks for <rooms> elements..
[08:44:26] <Duffman> with 'the old way of referring' I meant how I used to do it in my webapp (read: yesterday, it worked fine. :) )
[08:44:39] <Duffman> I have no problem to do it like $('#rooms')
[08:44:45] <Duffman> I'd just like to know why I have to do it like that right now
[08:44:48] <shoky> Duffman: ok, you weren't using jquery yesterday
[08:45:15] <Duffman> I only imported this src from jquery: 		<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.js"></script>
[08:45:16] <shoky> because that's how jquery works. it uses CSS-like selectors to find the elements you wanna do stuff with
[08:45:17] <Duffman> yesterday
[08:45:21] <shoky> i understand
[08:45:34] <shoky> ?g jquery getting started @ Duffman
[08:45:36] <bot-t> Duffman, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - jQuery Wiki - http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[08:46:17] <Duffman> I'll have a look at it, however I don't want to use Ajax
[08:46:20] <Duffman> thanks.
[08:46:27] <shoky> that has nothign to do with ajax man
[08:46:36] <shoky> it's "Getting Startd with jQuery"
[08:46:50] <shoky> it explains what the '#' is for.. for example
[08:46:54] <Duffman> yeah but I see some references to Ajax in the Contents part
[08:46:59] <shoky> so?
[08:47:03] <shoky> wtf.
[08:47:18] <Duffman> thanks, I'll have a look at it.:)
[08:48:05] <shoky> uhm
[08:48:22] <shoky> are you asking, if there is a way you can use the "old way" of referring to id's, and NOT use jquery?
[08:48:38] <shoky> i.e. you wanna go back to using prototype or whatever it is you were using before ?
[08:48:54] <shoky> if that's the case, look into jQuery.noConflict()
[08:48:57] <shoky> ?noConflict
[08:48:58] <bot-t> jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[08:49:20] <shoky> Duffman ^
[08:49:51] <trang> how can i detect if user touches the lower left corner of the screen?
[08:49:51] <Duffman> no it's okay. I was just curious why I should use the # tag
[08:50:12] <shoky> ok. # is css/jquery for ids
[08:50:16] <Duffman> I'll get there in  a minute as I'm reading the getting started page :)
[08:51:23] <Duffman> thanks shoelessone
[08:51:28] <Duffman> thanks shoky*
[08:51:28] <shoky> xD
[08:52:02] <Duffman> ^^
[09:03:45] <Lindrian> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/EJCEt/1/
[09:04:49] <shoky> Lindrian: $('#test').before(...)  returns $('#test')
[09:04:59] <Lindrian> what?
[09:05:00] <shoky> Lindrian: so you're setting the width and height of #test
[09:05:05] <Lindrian> oh
[09:05:06] <Lindrian> okay
[09:05:19] <Lindrian> how do I refer to #test2?
[09:05:52] <shoky> first of all you can do:  var test2 = $('<div id="test2">');
[09:06:06] <shoky> 2nd, you can use .insertBefore
[09:06:16] <shoky> Lindrian: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/EJCEt/2/
[09:06:46] <Lindrian> isnt insertBefore == before?
[09:06:48] <Lindrian> Docs said that I beleive
[09:06:53] <shoky> no

[09:28:53] <ThoMe> when i have this code  http://pastecode.org/index.php/view/30664959 and i have my js code with:
[09:28:59] <ThoMe>   $('.DatensatzUebernehmen').on("click", function () {
[09:29:02] <ThoMe>             alert('You Clicked Me');
[09:29:04] <ThoMe>          });
[09:29:20] <ThoMe> how i can the the value of <td>value1</td> and <td>value2</td> and <td>value3</td>
[09:29:32] <ThoMe> i mean td 2, 3 and 4
[09:31:43] <shoky> ThoMe: eh.. step by step
[09:31:46] <ReBa_> shoky, Hm yes, seems ilke sometimes it stops, but doesn't dissapear
[09:32:40] <Lindrian> I have an input box, how do I trigger an event when anything changes in it?
[09:32:45] <Lindrian> Anything typed, pasted, removed, etc.
[09:34:31] <ReBa_> Lindrian, I think you are looking for http://api.jquery.com/change/
[09:35:16] <Lindrian> ReBa_: can I bind a change event?
[09:36:46] <shoky> Lindrian: use 'input' event to catch all those
[09:37:13] <Lindrian> Got a link to the docs for it?
[09:37:25] <Lindrian> ?input event @ lindrian
[09:37:27] <bot-t> lindrian, .change() - Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[09:37:40] <shoky> nah
[09:37:59] <ThoMe> shoky: step by step?
[09:38:04] <shoky> Lindrian: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/5u2MZ/
[09:38:52] <Lindrian> awesome!!!
[09:38:53] <shoky> ThoMe:  first step: figure out how to select those 3 tds
[09:39:48] <Lindrian> Now the tricky part.... parenthesis highlight. I have no idea how to do this in javascript haha.
[09:39:54] <Lindrian> Would be so easy in PHP.
[09:40:37] <max|2> can u help  me shoky for use animate ?
[09:41:37] <Lindrian> shoky: Is there any way of finding out where the type-cursor is? Not sure what its called, the little vertical "pipe" that blinks at where you currently are in a text.
[09:46:35] <shoky> Lindrian: yeah.. but jquery doesn't have any built-in support for that. either native javascript, or find a jquery plugin for it :P  dont really remember what the API for it is
[09:46:48] <Lindrian> Native JS is fine
[09:46:54] <Lindrian> just need to figure out how :P
[09:47:15] <shoky> it's called the cursor or caret
[09:48:08] <shoky> Lindrian: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2897155/get-caret-position-within-an-text-input-field
[09:48:17] <Lindrian> was just reading that, haha
[09:48:22] <shoky> ;p
[09:48:34] <ThoMe> shoky:
[09:48:35] <ThoMe> hmm
[09:48:40] <ThoMe> is it good?
[09:48:41] <ThoMe>         $('.DatensatzUebernehmen').on("click", function () {
[09:48:41] <ThoMe>             var SpalteAdresse =  $(this).parents("tr").find("td:eq(1)").html();
[09:48:41] <ThoMe>             var SpalteName =  $(this).parents("tr").find("td:eq(2)").html();
[09:48:41] <ThoMe>             alert(SpalteAdresse + " " + SpalteName);
[09:48:44] <ThoMe>          });
[09:48:48] <ThoMe> it works but i dont know if good idea  :-)
[09:48:54] <shoky> ThoMe: don't paste code in the channel
[09:49:01] <ThoMe> shoky: excuse me mr.
[09:49:05] <Lindrian> shoky: that second answer, with the jquery implementation. Does that mean I can do $(element).getCursorPosition() ?
[09:49:07] <shoky> np sir
[09:49:30] <shoky> Lindrian yup looks like it
[09:49:39] <Lindrian> nice shit
[09:50:01] <ThoMe> shoky: and, looks good my code?
[09:51:09] <shoky> ThoMe: i guess. i'd use .closest() instead of .parents().  and .text() instead of .html()
[09:51:47] <Lindrian> shoky: the "input"-event doesnt seem to catch when I move with the arrows on my keyboard?
[09:52:00] <shoky> ThoMe: and i'd use a class like  class="adresse"   on the  address <td>
[09:52:18] <shoky> ThoMe: and look for it withi "td.adresse"   instead of  "td:eq(1)"  for example
[09:52:45] <shoky> Lindrian: yeah use keydown/keyup for those
[09:53:00] <shoky> Lindrian: if you want you can do .on('input keyup', function...
[09:53:08] <shoky> if you want the same handler for both of them,that is
[09:53:22] <Lindrian> awesome
[09:55:07] <ThoMe> shoky: perfect. have changed. thx very much
[10:01:00] <Lindrian> shoky: that element that I add to the DOM, can I make it surround another element?
[10:01:28] <Lindrian> $(oldElement).surround('<div/>'); would produce <div><oldElement></oldElement></div>
[10:01:36] <Lindrian> If you catch my drift?
[10:03:04] <eltigre> Hi, I'm using jquery mobile and I'm trying to create a "fingerpainting" canvas, which draws strokes on a canvas element
[10:04:06] <eltigre> I'm now at the point that it almost works. The only thing is the stroke positions are off, depending on the scroll position
[10:04:22] <shoky> Lindrian: see ?wrap
[10:04:23] <bot-t> Lindrian, .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[10:04:25] <eltigre> on the desktop it works nicely with eventoffsetX(Y
[10:04:31] <Lindrian> thanks
[10:04:42] <shoky> there's also wrapInner and wrapAll
[10:04:53] <Lindrian> Does it return the wrapped element?
[10:05:06] <shoky> don't think so
[10:05:07] <Lindrian> (a).wrap(b), which does it return?
[10:05:15] <eltigre> on an android chrome / default browser it won't work that way, since offsetX is undefined, and clientX is not correct
[10:05:26] <shoky> Lindrian: the API docs say it all
[10:05:45] <Lindrian> it does =(
[10:06:47] <shoky> i donno if there are any jquery methods xxx where a.xxx(b) returns b
[10:07:04] <shoky> er
[10:07:16] <shoky> that was stupid to say , i never did.
[10:07:24] <shoky> /clear
[10:08:45] <eltigre> nobody really seems to use vmousemove etc
[10:10:04] <shoky> i use mousemove etc
[10:10:25] <shoky> generally ;S
[10:10:32] <Technodrome> good day
[10:11:59] <eltigre> I think I found a solution
[10:14:13] <eltigre> hm great, that actually works
[10:21:46] <Lindrian> OK shoky: first of all, thanks for all the help. Secondly, my next problem is a bit more general JS oriented. Feel free to not want to help here haha. Basically I want to match parenthesises. I would do this with recursive regular expressions but I don't have the ability to do so right now since I'm using javascript. Basically, I want to do something like findParen(pos) and it will give me the closing or openeing parenthesis.
[10:22:02] <Lindrian> findParen("a()b", 2) would return 3
[10:22:04] <Lindrian> for example
[10:22:19] <Lindrian> findParen("a(b)c", 4) would return 2
[10:22:50] <Lindrian> Obviously this should work for nested parenthesises and stuff too. Would the best way be simply to loop and count parenthesises or is there a smarter way of doing it?
[10:28:06] <MichMich_> Guys, what Ajax Drag&Drop Upload framework are you guys using?
[10:33:23] <max|2> who can help me :(
[10:37:02] <ThoMe> hiho
[10:37:10] <ThoMe> emm. what is on this line wrong? $('#'+divid+'', window.opener.document ).(".td.name").html( SpalteName);
[10:37:35] <ThoMe> I would like change the html code inside the td name with the class name "name"
[10:37:41] <ThoMe> inside the divid "xcxyz"
[10:39:21] <fr0zenice> ThoMe: try "td.name" instead of ".td.name"
[10:40:25] <ThoMe> fr0zenice: i have test it with ('#'+divid+'', window.opener.document ).("td.name").html( "test");
[10:40:32] <ThoMe> but no error and now result :-(
[10:40:43] <ThoMe> is  ).("td.name"). <<is it correct?
[10:41:15] <fr0zenice> yeah, that should be for example .find("td.name")
[10:41:33] <max|2> http://jsfiddle.net/M6atN/17/
[10:42:46] <shoky> Lindrian: sorry, string scanning isn't my forte :P
[10:42:57] <ThoMe> fr0zenice: and instead td, is it posible to set the value in a input field?
[10:43:06] <fr0zenice> sure
[10:43:30] <fr0zenice> .find(...).val(SpalteName)
[10:43:49] <ThoMe> fr0zenice:  $('#'+divid+'', window.opener.document ).find("input.name").val( "test");
[10:43:52] <ThoMe> so?
[10:44:06] <fr0zenice> if the input has the class "name", yep
[10:44:21] <Lindrian> shoky: I got it working, bumped along another problem though.
[10:48:49] <ThoMe> fr0zenice: hm. this works $('#'+divid+'', window.opener.document ).find(".name").val(SpalteName);
[10:48:53] <ThoMe> but
[10:49:03] <ThoMe> $('#'+divid+'', window.opener.document ).find(".input.name").val(SpalteName);  not
[10:49:28] <fr0zenice> ThoMe: input.name, not .input.name
[10:49:36] <ThoMe> ah
[10:49:38] <ThoMe> without .
[10:55:15] <ThoMe> fr0zenice: em
[10:55:40] <ThoMe> fr0zenice: when I create an element with document.createElement and try to search this element by id then i havent a result
[10:55:45] <ThoMe> fr0zenice: can you help please?
[10:56:17] <fr0zenice> ThoMe: you need to insert/append it somewhere
[11:13:08] <ThoMe> fr0zenice: waht you mean?
[11:13:19] <ThoMe> fr0zenice: have now recode with $('table#empfaenger_liste').append(html);
[11:13:23] <ThoMe> is this what you mean?
[11:14:37] <fr0zenice> ThoMe: kinda yes, if you don't insert/append your new element it can't be found in the DOM tree
[11:14:59] <ThoMe> fr0zenice: AH OK
[11:42:19] <Dave_Stein> totally blanking here.. isn't there a jQuery method to say how many properties an object has or am I making that?
[11:42:21] <Dave_Stein> *that up
[11:42:21] <ThoMe> fr0zenice: thank you very much. works fine
[11:42:32] <Dave_Stein> can't find one in utilities
[11:42:55] <LocalPCGuy> Dave_Stein .lenght
[11:42:58] <LocalPCGuy> Dave_Stein .length
[11:43:08] <LocalPCGuy> ?
[11:43:31] <Dave_Stein> LocalPCGuy no  I mean a regular object not a jQ one
[11:43:46] <LocalPCGuy> ah, ok, yah, wondered if I misread that ?
[11:47:40] <LocalPCGuy> could you just do object.keys(myObj).length?
[11:47:46] <LocalPCGuy> I guess that would count props that are inherited also though I think
[11:47:59] <Dave_Stein> I thought object.keys isn't supported in all browsers
[11:48:01] <Dave_Stein> isn't that es5?
[11:48:28] <LocalPCGuy> yah, but there is a really simple workaround to polyfill it (depending on how bulletproof you want it to be)
[11:48:52] <sadtaco> Why is indexdb so much more confusing than localStorage when it basically doe the same thing..
[11:49:10] <Dave_Stein> Eh I think I'm gonna figure another way to do this without a count of objects anyway... working on UI so can't really use a polyfill
[11:50:00] <LocalPCGuy> if you decide to implement the fix, you can take a look at the MDN page: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys
[11:51:02] <Dave_Stein> thx
[12:18:42] <max|2> who can help me  http://jsfiddle.net/M6atN/17/
[12:34:48] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 http://jsfiddle.net/M6atN/22/
[12:35:26] <LocalPCGuy> refactored the inline onclicks to be unobtrusive.
[12:54:16] <sadtaco> How can I make an $.each() iterate over slowly? I'm doing a super slow operation
[12:54:58] <wroathe> sadtaco: What do you mean iterate over slowly?
[12:55:16] <sadtaco> Have a 250ms delay between each loop.
[12:55:45] <sadtaco> Instead of going as fast as the browser will allow which locks it up.
[12:56:18] <LocalPCGuy> don't use .each() ... just setup a recursive function that calls itself with a setTimeout
[12:57:57] <sadtaco> well I'm finding things on how to repeat something every few seconds, but I want to delay the looping over an array here to give 250ms or so between each.
[12:58:14] <sadtaco> http://miljenkobarbir.com/for-loop-with-a-delay-in-javascript/ looks right
[12:58:35] <LocalPCGuy> exactly.  A setTimeout is designed to delay before calling something again
[12:59:22] <wroathe> function foo() { doStuff(); setTimeout(foo, 250); }
[13:00:35] <sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/yFRw7/1/
[13:00:40] <sadtaco> My problem with this...
[13:00:59] <sadtaco> Is that it's going to keep looping and triggering that "return".  There is no real "stop" to it, just a "do nothing" over and over.
[13:01:09] <sadtaco> oh wait nevermind
[13:02:25] <puchacz> hi, I am thinking of a simple ajax framework: (1) the whole webpage has a lot of components, all rendered on serverside with <div id=...></div> (2) when a user clicks ajax action, clientside chooses which div to be grayed out with "wait" animation, (3) server decides which components are dirty and sends these divs only in a regular http text stream or sends "http://...." string if it wants to redirect client to another page. (4)
[13:02:27] <puchacz> clientside jquery either splits incoming <div>s and replaces them ajax-way or if it is "http://", redirects
[13:02:31] <puchacz> makes sense?
[13:03:00] <puchacz> maybe there is a framework that does something like this already....?
[13:42:46] <sunbeam> hi, i've got a site i need to debug and i would like to find a way to remove a certain script (file) re-add it and re-init
[13:42:51] <sunbeam> Any idea how I can do this best with firebug?
[14:04:04] <sunbeam> Anyone in here has experience using jQuery datatables plugin?
[14:04:36] <rindolf> sunbeam: do you have a more specific question?
[14:04:48] <rindolf> subbyyy: like they say ‚ÄúDon't ask to ask.‚Äù
[14:05:05] <AdrianG> demand to ask instead.
[14:05:37] <subbyyy> ?
[14:10:30] <Technodrome> is it possible to get believable multi touch in the browser?
[14:11:48] <sunbeam> rindolf: yes, have you used it?
[14:12:36] <LocalPCGuy> technodrome: I just listened to a podcast about the Microsoft team developing a multitouch game (converting it from iOS.)  So it is definitely possible
[14:12:54] <rindolf> sunbeam: I don't think I did.
[14:13:14] <rindolf> subbyyy: sorry - that was directed at sunbeam
[14:13:20] <rindolf> Tab completion SNAFU.
[14:13:29] <Technodrome> LocalPCGuy:  i mean here on my mac ‚Ä¶.its like all the gestures are OS level, so a 2 finger swipe will go back a page
[14:13:34] <LocalPCGuy> technodrome: Contre Jour - http://venturebeat.com/2012/10/09/html5-gaming-contre-jour-ie10/
[14:13:35] <Technodrome> rather than interact with the query stuff
[14:14:23] <LocalPCGuy> I'm guessing it depends on the browser and if the OS allows it to intercept the touch events and prevent them from getting to the OS level
[14:14:52] <Technodrome> yeah
[14:15:01] <Technodrome> desktop wise, i dont think that is plausible with osx
[14:15:25] <Technodrome> i do love how microsoft is really pushing html 5 / hardware acceleration / all that fun stuff as of late
[14:15:48] <LocalPCGuy> definitely, although it feels weird to say something like that about Microsoft :P
[14:17:07] <Technodrome> i mean fair is fair
[14:17:19] <Technodrome> i dont see apple doing that stuff, although i wish they would
[14:17:25] <Technodrome> they seem to not like the fact of games in the browser
[14:17:25] <Technodrome> but
[14:17:29] <subbyyy> rindof: no problem :)
[14:17:33] <subbyyy> rindolf*
[14:17:40] <Technodrome> i'm not the biggest fan either, but hey, if it gives me a smooth browser all around, i'll take it
[14:17:44] <Technodrome> safari 6 is pretty smooth
[14:18:33] <rindolf> subbyyy: OK.
[14:19:47] <LocalPCGuy> In general, I'm a Firefox guy for browser/home use, Chrome for developing...Safari on a PC is blech
[14:20:11] <nsanden> anyone looking for a small amount of jquery work, pm me for info. I pay fair.
[14:21:14] <AdrianG> whats fair
[14:22:55] <nsanden> you tell me
[14:23:08] <OneBraveHog> I see JQuerymobile is invite only
[14:23:17] <OneBraveHog> any idea how long that is or why ?
[14:23:22] <OneBraveHog> seems so strange to lock that
[14:23:59] <OneBraveHog> I suppose I could just use Jquery ON mobile devices ?
[14:24:12] <OneBraveHog> I once used a jquery tab with success on a mobile phone
[14:24:21] <OneBraveHog> anyone here use jquery on phones ?
[14:24:53] <tra> there is jQueryMobile too
[14:25:50] <OneBraveHog> tra- how do you mean  ?
[14:26:02] <OneBraveHog> I had typed in /join #jquerymobile and it said locked
[14:26:25] <tra> OneBraveHog: well you can just use your browser http://jquerymobile.com/
[14:26:35] <OneBraveHog> true true
[14:26:39] <OneBraveHog> I'm there - and have been there
[14:26:47] <OneBraveHog> I mean, of course I don't NEED the freenode chan
[14:26:51] <OneBraveHog> I was just puzzled it was locked
[14:27:32] <OneBraveHog> just seems odd to prevent people from contributing.
[14:27:33] <OneBraveHog> anyway
[14:27:57] <OneBraveHog> I'm starting some phone dev, and I think jquery will be enough for what I need for GUI
[14:28:03] <OneBraveHog> it's been  a while
[14:38:59] <fabsys> hello
[14:39:43] <fabsys> I have a problem with update of an hidden form input
[14:40:20] <fabsys> the value are never updated but when I change the type=text my code work perfectly
[14:40:39] <fabsys> my jquery code: $("input[name='item_name']").val("good");
[14:40:55] <fabsys> my input: <input id="hiddenbox" name="item_name" type="text" value="" />
[14:41:04] <fabsys> someone can help me ?
[14:42:03] <LocalPCGuy> how are you determining it isn't working?
[14:42:40] <fabsys> because my value are never update with "good' text
[14:43:02] <LocalPCGuy> you could always just set value with .attr('value', 'good')
[14:45:11] <fabsys> $("input[name='item_name']").attr('value','good');
[14:45:15] <fabsys> like this ?
[14:45:19] <LocalPCGuy> sure
[14:45:26] <fabsys> I try
[14:46:30] <fabsys> LocalPCGuy it's no work ...
[14:46:33] <fabsys> my page:
[14:46:42] <fabsys> https://www.prolixeserver.com/preview/paiement.php
[14:46:57] <LocalPCGuy> are you looking at the source to determine if it worked or are you actually testing it in JavaScript?
[14:47:03] <fabsys> I think it's not working because it's an hidden type
[14:47:06] <LocalPCGuy> or posting the value to a server?
[14:47:37] <fabsys> no I just testing
[14:48:40] <LocalPCGuy> I hope you aren't using hidden fields to send a value to paypal for payment
[14:49:25] <LocalPCGuy> that is extremely easy to "hack" and get whatever it is you are supposed to be paying for for free (for unscrupulous folks)
[14:49:25] <Christer> fabsys: its not getting the jQuery script..
[14:49:29] <Christer> [blocked] The page at https://www.prolixeserver.com/preview/paiement.php ran insecure content from http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js.
[14:49:52] <fabsys> I use it :d but I check if all is ok in my post-processing php script
[14:49:59] <LocalPCGuy> ok
[14:50:07] <fabsys> don't worry my page is secure
[14:50:08] <LocalPCGuy> I had no problem getting jquery
[14:50:41] <Christer> Its not downloading jQuery on his page from my end atleast.
[14:51:05] <LocalPCGuy> have you tired a different method of getting to the hidden input
[14:51:24] <LocalPCGuy> or tried logging the jquery object to make sure it is actually finding the input appropriately
[14:51:25] <LocalPCGuy> ?
[14:53:28] <fabsys> yes I need to update hidden input according customer selection (for post correct value)
[14:55:09] <LocalPCGuy> well, I can update the hidden from the command line in firebug just fine using .val()
[14:55:31] <LocalPCGuy> so the problem isn't .val('good') or the fact that it is a hidden input
[14:55:53] <LocalPCGuy> probably has to do with your code in the selector or maybe it is not executing the section where you attempt to set it
[14:56:50] <LocalPCGuy> in fact, it is updating the text in your code to 'good'
[14:57:04] <LocalPCGuy> again, how are you checking that it is failing?
[14:57:27] <LocalPCGuy> are you just viewing source?
[14:57:53] <fabsys> I yes
[14:58:05] <LocalPCGuy> yah, you need to use something like firebug or chrome inspector
[14:58:09] <fabsys> html source after executing the jquery section
[14:58:09] <Christer> LocalPCGuy: Trying to access it with Chrome! His page doesnt load jquery before the script executes. (it looks)
[14:58:25] <Christer> so: Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[14:58:33] <LocalPCGuy> Christer: I saw you say that, but it does load for me.  So something to do with your setup
[14:58:49] <Christer> but it might not load from his either this way.
[14:58:53] <Christer> since its working for you.
[14:59:22] <LocalPCGuy> Christer: possible, but he said it works when he changes it to type="text" so seems like it is working on his side
[14:59:33] <fabsys> yes
[14:59:53] <LocalPCGuy> Christer: I really think he just isn't testing it properly - viewing source is not going to show the updated value
[14:59:57] <fabsys> see I will change the type to text

[15:00:55] <fabsys> I not understand
[15:01:01] <LocalPCGuy> fabsys: right, it is also working with type=hidden
[15:01:17] <fabsys> ok

[15:02:02] <nemothekid> Question about ajax requests : If I make multiple GET requests to the same cacheable resource in a succession, will 3 requests be made, or just 1?
[15:02:04] <LocalPCGuy> hmm..ignore that last one
[15:02:22] <fabsys> I will get firebug and see that
[15:02:32] <LocalPCGuy> fabsys: so use Chrome Inspector or Firefox with Firebug
[15:03:09] <fabsys> ok thx very much LocalPCGuy I download firebug
[15:03:47] <LocalPCGuy> nemothekid: you could probably just use firebug or chrome inspector net panel to view the request and find out
[15:07:29] <sunbeam> Anyone in here has experience using jQuery datatables plugin?
[15:07:45] <LocalPCGuy> sunbeam: you should be more specific and just ask the question you have about the plugin
[15:09:25] <nemothekid> LocalPCGuy: With the proper headers, Chrome doesn't even make another request. I guess I can assume its being cached
[15:09:40] <LocalPCGuy> sounds like it.
[15:10:27] <LocalPCGuy> you may want to test it cross-browser - seems like the kind of thing that may be browser specific

[15:23:10] <OneBraveHog> anyone else keep getting disconnected ?
[15:23:45] <LocalPCGuy> no
[15:55:48] <sunbeam> Does anyone know something about IE Developer Tools? I've got a site that gives an error when I enable/disable Compatibility view.. Then I live edit some HTML, and then I like to test if the same error still occurs (Javascript error)
[15:55:52] <sunbeam> any idea how I can best do that?>
[15:56:42] <LocalPCGuy> sunbeam: does the error happen in native versions of IE?
[15:57:38] <LocalPCGuy> sunbeam: as far as I know, you have to change the source code on the server because the compatibility bar will always reload the page to change "versions"
[15:58:06] <sunbeam> ah damnit
[15:58:11] <sunbeam> i can't right now
[15:58:19] <LocalPCGuy> can't test it locally?
[15:58:19] <sunbeam> LocalPCGuy: and yes
[15:58:33] <sunbeam> LocalPCGuy: I can save it, but i really don't know how to exactly replicate the site
[15:58:39] <sunbeam> I tried saving it with Firefox, but no errors
[15:59:09] <LocalPCGuy> ideally you would have access to the source code for a website you are working on (like I said, in an ideal world)
[15:59:22] <sunbeam> hehe so whats the best way to save it
[15:59:43] <LocalPCGuy> log into the server and ftp the source locally
[15:59:45] <LocalPCGuy> :P
[16:04:25] <sunbeam> no way to refresh the updated page?

In a traditional DB, you set indexes as a setting, which makes searching them faster.  I don't really understand what setting an index here does, and if I only have to do it once after creating the db, or what.

[16:27:45] <bossesjoe> well I guess I could put it in its own sub tag..
[16:27:56] <LocalPCGuy> bossesjoe: no, but you could read the span tag and re-add that back with the updated text

[16:39:51] <sadtaco> A timestamp like "1341777679" in javascript should be unique right?   I mean if I timestamped every line in javascript, there is no way it could have two the same because it's synchronous, no?
[16:40:13] <LocalPCGuy> in theory
[16:42:44] <sadtaco> I've been making them with "var date = data.date? data.date : unixtime();"  It sounds like they should be unique..
[16:43:01] <sadtaco> er, and if it's set they'd be from a server.  So actually..
[16:43:26] <sadtaco> It's possibly the server made one the same time as the client.  Need unique keys for indexedDB.
[16:44:36] <sadtaco> Oh no.  That's divided by 1000 too. Considerable chance there is overlap.
[16:45:49] <LocalPCGuy> might look at this SO post, couple different ways to generate GUID-like numbers in JavaScript

[17:16:45] <wilornel> Hey guys, im having this problem where when the user types something in the search bar, on keyup, jquery makes an ajax call to receive the results and then append them to a id="result" element, but now Im getting duplicates
[17:18:19] <Lee-> I'm trying to show/hide a form element based on the selection in another element. This other element is a hierarchical select where the main select box triggers a secondary select box. I've got my code working with the main select box (I had to change my function from .change() to .live('change')). How can I bind to the changing state of the secondary select box? This is a dynamically generated select that doesn't exsit when the page is loaded, but the id is
[17:18:19] <Lee->  always the same
[17:22:50] <Lee-> here's my code: http://pastebin.com/zg5FdFe1
[17:23:33] <Benn> Shouldn't $(window).innerWidth(); return the width of the window?
[17:23:34] <Lee-> the part that is commented out works fine as it is set for #edit-field-product-category-und-hierarchical-select-selects-0, which is the primary category, but the code that is not commented is not working. It is set for #edit-field-product-category-und-hierarchical-select-selects-1, which is the secondary category that is generated dynamically
[17:37:39] <wroathe> Benn: Depends on when you're calling it.
[17:38:37] <Benn> I was just reading that you should use .width() on the document and window objects.
[17:39:31] <Benn> I switched to using $(body).innerWidth(); I'm not sure which is better.
[17:52:08] <sadtaco> Why doesn't objectStore.delete(event.target.result.key);   http://pastebin.com/AXig2cAB

[17:52:53] <sadtaco> No "onerror" either
[17:54:19] <Gorroth> hi
[17:56:56] <max|2> who can help me :(
[17:58:36] <Lee-> I've tried binding to the 'change' event using .change, .live, and using both the element id and it's class, but it doesn't seem to be working for the dynamically created elements. What ist he proper way to bind events to dynamically generated select inputs?
[18:02:23] <LocalPCGuy> lee-: you should be using .on() with a delegate format (assuming you are using jquery v1.7+)
[18:02:46] <Lee-> LocalPCGuy, I believe I have jquery 1.4
[18:03:03] <LocalPCGuy> then you can just use delegate, I believe
[18:03:29] <jastor> aah .. 24th .. happy offending holiday everyone
[18:03:31] <Lee-> 1.4.4 it seems
[18:03:33] <LocalPCGuy> $('aParentElement').delegate('change', 'theElement', callbackFunction);
[18:03:53] <Lee-> I read that live() was supposed to work for dynamically generated elements. I'll give delegate a try
[18:04:02] <LocalPCGuy> ?delegate
[18:04:02] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[18:04:06] <Lee-> thanks
[18:04:54] <jastor> LocalPCGuy: whats the difference between live and delegate btw?
[18:05:01] <LocalPCGuy> that is what live is for - delegate gives you the same ability but you can put your event listener on any parent element of the children you are listening for
[18:05:13] <LocalPCGuy> live binds the listener on the document
[18:05:45] <sadtaco> ah it wasn't readwrite
[18:05:55] <LocalPCGuy> so $(document.body).delegate('change', 'element', function) is the same as $('element').live('change', function...);
[18:06:05] <LocalPCGuy> in effect
[18:06:08] <LocalPCGuy> ?live
[18:06:08] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[18:07:50] <LocalPCGuy> Lee- : good explanation of the diff here: http://www.learningjquery.com/2010/03/using-delegate-and-undelegate-in-jquery-1-4-2
[18:08:24] <LocalPCGuy> Lee-: and both have been replaced by .on() in 1.7+
[18:10:05] <LocalPCGuy> jastor: just noticed you askd the question about live/delegate, see the link I just posted for a good comparison but note in 1.7+ they have both been replaced by .on()
[18:13:02] <Lee-> I'm not having luck with delegate either. I've tried swapping the 1st and 2nd arguments as well. The documentation seems to imply a different ordering than your example. I'm new to javascript in general, so I don't know where my problems are lying (if they're specific to jquery, js, etc)
[18:13:34] <LocalPCGuy> Lee-: oops, yah, my bad, I gave you the order for .on()  - forgot that delegate was swapped
[18:13:44] <max|2> how i can animate with other animate callback ?
[18:13:56] <LocalPCGuy> ?animate
[18:13:56] <bot-t> .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[18:13:58] <Lee-> I did try both ways without success though. I've also tried differenet methods of referencing the parent element
[18:14:11] <max|2> yes
[18:14:12] <max|2> i know
[18:14:24] <max|2> but the second animate sux because it s to speed the first
[18:15:07] <LocalPCGuy> max|2: you can put the second animate in the callback, it'll happen after the first is complete.  It can have it's own timing and even it's own callback if you need it
[18:15:23] <max|2> http://pastebin.com/8qDrx56J
[18:15:51] <LocalPCGuy> Lee-: I always recommend learning JS first prior to starting with jQuery, although I know that isn't always possible when work requires something
[18:15:53] <Lee-> http://pastebin.com/TgpEpj1a
[18:16:56] <LocalPCGuy> Lee-: ah...yah, you can't chain .live() like that - that is one of the reasons it has been phased out
[18:17:03] <Lee-> I've tried using the parent as "body", "div", "div.selects", ".selects". The immediate parent element of this is <div class="selects">
[18:17:12] <LocalPCGuy> oh...never mind, that is just a long selector, nvrmind
[18:17:34] <LocalPCGuy> that is a REALLY long ID btw
[18:17:41] <Lee-> LocalPCGuy, it's generated by Drupal
[18:17:45] <LocalPCGuy> ugh
[18:18:01] <Lee-> in fact, the dynamic generation of the element I'm trying to access is also generated by a Drupal module
[18:18:07] <max|2> ??
[18:18:11] <LocalPCGuy> Lee-: is it not firing the callback ever?
[18:18:12] <max|2> LocalPCGuy ?
[18:18:19] <Lee-> I never see the alert for 'yay'
[18:19:09] <Lee-> the page loads with a select list. Depending on what option is selected, a second select list is dynamically generated. The id of this is always the same.
[18:19:33] <Lee-> My binding to the main select list using .live() works fine, but I can't seem to get anything to bind to the second (dynamically generated) list
[18:19:40] <max|2> can u help me local ?
[18:21:02] <LocalPCGuy> Lee-: you don't need the () around the function callback, not sure if they stop anything from working though
[18:21:49] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 looks fine to me
[18:22:28] <Lee-> just seemsl ike it's not binding correctly as I never see the 'yay' alert, nor do I see anything in the firebug console
[18:22:29] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 you could set specific duration for each if you want, but the code looks correct
[18:22:41] <max|2> how ?
[18:22:51] <LocalPCGuy> ?animate @max|2
[18:22:51] <bot-t> max|2, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[18:22:59] <max|2> normal
[18:23:01] <max|2> is duration
[18:23:19] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 you can  set it to a specific number
[18:24:11] <LocalPCGuy> Lee- if you are seeing nothing, it probably means it isn't getting the object in the first place.  Try doing a console.log($('superlongID').length) above where you set the event handler and see if it is finding the element at all
[18:24:17] <max|2> yes
[18:24:18] <max|2> i set
[18:24:18] <sheilablackrose> hi if i have an $('.myclass').onclick(function(){ $(this).prop('cecked'); });  how can i migrate this to a js file? i would need to pass in the this value to the function in the js right
[18:24:21] <max|2> 1500
[18:24:21] <max|2> ok
[18:24:31] <max|2> so it s not work
[18:26:21] <LocalPCGuy> sheilablackrose the 'this' is passed in automatically
[18:26:27] <LocalPCGuy> by JavaScript
[18:26:39] <LocalPCGuy> ?this
[18:26:39] <bot-t> my code, http://jsfiddle.net/rTus6/
[18:26:55] <sheilablackrose> do i put th eonclick even in the js as well?
[18:26:59] <sheilablackrose> the
[18:27:59] <LocalPCGuy> sheilablackrose you wouldn't want to use onclick - that is the javascript version of the event handler.  You either want to use .on() (v1.7+) or .click() (earlier versions)
[18:28:30] <sheilablackrose> thnks
[18:29:31] <Lee-> OK now this seems to only be executing the function when the primary select is changed and the secondary select is initially created. Subsequent changes to the second select do not trigger the callback function anymore
[18:30:05] <Lee-> Also the reason that this wasn't working is that sometime since I started working on this javascript and when I started trying to figure out the secondary issue, the DNS got updated to point to a different server. So the code I was changing wasn't for the server I was accessing.
[18:30:16] <LocalPCGuy> Lee- if you are referencing the selects by ID, you'll need a separate event handler for each select
[18:30:29] <Lee-> Now that I have the code on the correct server now I do see the callback execute, but it's only executing when the secondary select is first created, not upon subsequent changes to the select
[18:30:42] <sheilablackrose> LocalPcGuy: when i put the hwole .click function into the js. it doesnt recognize when i click
[18:30:48] <Lee-> I'm only interested in the secondary select, which has a single ID that is always the same.
[18:30:52] <sheilablackrose> *whole
[18:31:29] <Lee-> oyh nevermind
[18:31:36] <Lee-> when i copied this stuff over I screwed up the select id
[18:31:57] <Lee-> I think it's working fine now. Much thanks for the assistance!
[18:32:08] <LocalPCGuy> Lee- it might be better to not use the ID in cases when they are that long - plus drupal could potentially change it
[18:32:51] <LocalPCGuy> Lee- better to add a class (if you can control that)
[18:33:37] <LocalPCGuy> sheilablackrose and you are including the JS file and the area you put the click function in is definitely being executed (i.e. not in an if block or a function that isn't executed)?
[18:34:57] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/kxp5R/ this what i have in the js.
[18:36:38] <LocalPCGuy> sheilablackrose why unbind() then rebind?
[18:36:55] <sheilablackrose> i have no idea cuz when i ut.cliuck alone nthng happens
[18:37:04] <sheilablackrose> but when i unbind n rebind it works
[18:37:06] <sheilablackrose> ny idea?
[18:37:27] <max|2> don t work http://pastebin.com/NTRCzaxz
[18:37:29] <max|2> call back
[18:37:43] <LocalPCGuy> well, with check boxes you should likely be watching the 'change' event
[18:38:10] <LocalPCGuy> and you shouldn't have to unbind first, if you do, something else might be interfering or interacting with your code
[18:38:24] <max|2> local ?
[18:38:25] <sheilablackrose> ok ill try the .chabge event
[18:38:34] <sheilablackrose> but either way why it doesnt work if i put it in the js file
[18:38:38] <sheilablackrose> it works when its in the code
[18:38:47] <LocalPCGuy> ?doesnt work
[18:38:48] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[18:39:15] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 please be more specific
[18:39:23] <sheilablackrose> when i p[ut it in the js file it doesnt work but when its in the code it does
[18:39:26] <max|2> the seconde animate
[18:39:28] <max|2> don t work
[18:39:33] <max|2> because it s speed
[18:39:46] <max|2> it s not wait for complete the first
[18:40:19] <max|2> when the first animate it s finish i want execute the second
[18:40:21] <LocalPCGuy> sheilablackrose is the JS file referenced correctly in the HTML?  is it being loaded (see net panel of Firebug or Chrome Inspector).  it is being called after document ready or in the footer of the document?
[18:40:44] <sheilablackrose> yup that is loaded i have other codes running
[18:41:09] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 given the code you linked, the callback syntax is correct.  Likely there is something else causing it to not work rather than the code you linked
[18:41:47] <LocalPCGuy> sheilablackrose: how about the document.ready or it being loaded in the footer?
[18:42:15] <max|2> can i query for give url ?
[18:42:26] <sheilablackrose> the document ready is in th epage
[18:42:37] <sheilablackrose> do i need to add document ready in the js fiule
[18:42:37] <sheilablackrose> ?
[18:43:03] <LocalPCGuy> does it call something in the JS file from the one in the document?
[18:43:16] <gobee> hey i am trying to use http://jsfiddle.net/dLDS9/
[18:43:26] <sheilablackrose> nope
[18:43:26] <gobee> I just put the script text right into .js file
[18:43:30] <gobee> but, do i need to do somethign else?
[18:44:00] <gobee> and i see it appear in source, but nothing happening
[18:44:03] <LocalPCGuy> sheilablackrose then yes, you should wrap the code in your JS file in document.ready or you should load your JS at the very end of the page
[18:44:05] <wroathe> sheilablackrose: You mentioned you've done some .NET development before. Being that have limited knowledge of JS wouldn't picking up a book on the subject be a more efficient way of learning rather than spending all of your time in IRC?
[18:44:33] <wroathe> sheilablackrose: Not trying to be mean. Just reiterating what I was told when I first started learning.
[18:45:39] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 there are CSS errors preventing your JS from working.
[18:45:48] <sheilablackrose> yeah i agree with you curetnly reading up on mvc. im on the clock so i dont have the luxury to learn from scratch. but whatever free time i have im reading for now its focused on mvc n code first frame work
[18:46:17] <wroathe> sheilablackrose: Somebody pays you for this? Good god.
[18:46:17] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 similar question to what wroathe just asked - you really need to know the basics before you jump into full blown jquery animations, no matter what people say
[18:46:24] <LocalPCGuy> lol
[18:46:30] <sheilablackrose> hahaha yeah its my job :(
[18:46:53] <sheilablackrose> mvc itself is giving nme a stroke
[18:47:14] <max|2> when you click you change background and div
[18:47:18] <wroathe> mvc is architecture... typically an advanced topic that should be learning after basic programming skills have been vetted.
[18:47:26] <wroathe> should be learned*
[18:47:39] <sheilablackrose> yup i use to code on windows c#
[18:47:50] <sheilablackrose> than i stop and did my business degree
[18:47:52] <max|2> so u can help me ?
[18:47:57] <sheilablackrose> than now i got back into it
[18:48:02] <max|2> i know with fade in fade ou
[18:48:04] <sheilablackrose> but it has mvc n full web end
[18:48:10] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 I will not "fix it for you" that is not what this channel is for
[18:48:10] <max|2> but i need to use animate for framerate
[18:49:07] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 you really need to go back to basics - your CSS for instance for box2 has 2 display: none.  You are animating opacity, but never clearing the display: none property
[18:49:32] <max|2> but its work with fade
[18:49:40] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 so even when it is at opacity:1, it still has the display: none property.  That SHOULD give you enough to fix it

[18:53:39] <dibic> hi, I'm trying to figure out how to achieve the hover effect of the buttons on this page: http://telesc.pe. i've tried investigating through chrome's inspect element feature but i haven't found the responsible code
[18:54:06] <wroathe> LocalPCGuy: O.o Yeah, run-in, you know. When you want your node display like two cars colliding.
[18:54:11] <wroathe> LocalPCGuy: All the cool kids are using it.
[18:54:31] <dibic> i figure it's some kind of jquery with a zoom or opacity effect, so i thought i'd check here
[18:54:48] <LocalPCGuy> wroathe OH...that "run-in" ... duh
[18:54:56] <max|2> runing for
[18:55:05] <max|2> opacity 1
[18:55:56] <wroathe> dibic: It's pure CSS.
[18:56:19] <sheilablackrose> i've added the document ready but still the same http://jsfiddle.net/8BvHj/
[18:57:53] <max|2>    $("#"+boxtmp).animate( {opacity: "1", display: "run-in"}, 2000 );
[18:58:26] <dibic> wroathe: ah, thanks, i see it now.
[18:59:00] <wroathe> max|2: Jesus
[18:59:25] <wroathe> Sarcasm is a bad idea
[18:59:26] <LocalPCGuy> wroathe: it appears run-in is actually a display property.  Why you would ever use it, I don't know
[18:59:31] <LocalPCGuy> wroate: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/display.html
[18:59:46] <gobee> hey im new to javascript, do I just paste the section from the javascript into a .js file or do I need to wrap it in something? http://jsfiddle.net/dLDS9/
[19:00:11] <LocalPCGuy> oops, sorry, that link should have been to max|2
[19:00:15] <wroathe> LocalPCGuy: Err, mer, gerd. Mind blown.
[19:00:18] <max|2> the first
[19:00:23] <max|2> i have display none
[19:01:15] <max|2> when i start page now i have display none
[19:02:15] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 and you think it should somehow be display: run-in in the animation?  There is a much better display property you should use,and it is actually the default for the div before you overrode it.
[19:04:00] <max|2> if all display is none i need
[19:04:34] <LocalPCGuy> ?books @gobee
[19:04:35] <bot-t> gobee, Learning jQuery, jQuery Cookbook, and jQuery Enlightenment
[19:04:46] <max|2> clearing display
[19:05:00] <gobee> i dont need javascript much, just want this feature
[19:05:14] <max|2> block
[19:05:34] <LocalPCGuy> gobee: to use jQuery, you should know JavaScript.  Otherwise you spend time trying to figure out relatively trivial problems
[19:05:53] <max|2> because i have fucking english
[19:06:14] <gobee> ok, well the jquery is loaded, and I have a js with the text in it, and the same text in my html, but it doens't work
[19:06:32] <LocalPCGuy> gobee where are you loading your JS file?
[19:06:38] <gobee> header
[19:06:44] <gobee> after jquery
[19:07:11] <gobee> but i'm pretty sure i need to wrap it something.. like a function..
[19:07:17] <gobee> i literally just put that text in the.js file
[19:07:51] <gobee> yeah it would be good to learn.. but for now i just want this simple feature to work
[19:08:26] <LocalPCGuy> gobee: exactly my point about learning JavaScript.  Because it is loaded in the header, none of the rest of the DOM is loaded yet, so it likely can't find the elements in question.  Best practice is to put all of your JavaScript (with a few exceptions) just above the closing body tag
[19:08:43] <wroathe> gobee: There are two solutions to your problem.
[19:08:44] <LocalPCGuy> gobee: or you can wrap your code in the jQuery document ready function
[19:09:28] <wroathe> gobee: You can either place it before the closing body tag (so that the element exists at the time that script is run) or you can bind it to the document's onreadstatechange event so that it only runs after the entire document has finished loading.
[19:09:42] <wroathe> The former is preferable because in most cases it reduces overhead.
[19:10:02] <wroathe> gobee: $(document).ready(function () { // code goes here });
[19:10:32] <gobee> ok, thanks, I didnt know tags needed to be up b/c I thought like mouse enter woudl be always ready
[19:10:36] <gobee> thanks wroathe
[19:10:39] <max|2>  $("#"+boxtmp).animate( {opacity: "1", display: "block"}, 2000 );
[19:11:23] <wroathe> max|2: Can we get some more context? Or did you post it already?
[19:11:29] <LocalPCGuy> not to self promote, but I put together a collection of mostly free JavaScript resources recently: http://bit.ly/VoIj7V
[19:11:40] <LocalPCGuy> for those that are still learning JS
[19:11:41] <max|2> i start page i have display none
[19:11:51] <max|2> i run javascript with $("#"+boxtmp).animate( {opacity: "1", display: "in-line"}, 2000 );
[19:12:00] <wroathe> max|2: That doesn't help.
[19:12:09] <wroathe> max|2: We need more code: https://gist.github.com/
[19:15:04] <max|2> https://gist.github.com/4367300
[19:16:19] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 You could use .css() to set display: block, opacity: 0 on the hidden element, then animate it to opacity: 1 and then animate the showing one to opacity: 0, then set display: none in .css() after the animation completes (in the callback.)
[19:16:44] <rakl> if I want to host my scss stylesheets in a separate repo, is it possible to include them in the asset pipeline?
[19:16:57] <wroathe> max|2: There are two problems I see with that
[19:17:13] <max|2> i have
[19:17:14] <rakl> basically take my stylesheets directory our and put it in a new repo on github
[19:17:16] <max|2> more div
[19:17:24] <rakl> s/our/out
[19:17:31] <max|2> and more #box*
[19:17:40] <wroathe> max|2: The first problem is that you've got the script tag before the markup (the div#box1 will not exist at that point). The second problem is that both display: none and opacity: 0 need to be set in order for that animate to work.
[19:17:45] <max|2> i need the first all box are none !
[19:19:05] <max|2> i have menu when i click i change div with anime
[19:19:13] <max|2> with many box
[19:19:37] <wroathe> max|2: https://gist.github.com/4367304
[19:20:10] <sheilablackrose> i change dthe checkbox events to change. wraapped it in doc ready.  ive added a test functio in the js. the test functions runs but the chekcbox.change still doesnt. any idea? http://jsfiddle.net/8BvHj/1/
[19:21:13] <wroathe> max|2: https://gist.github.com/4367304 sorry
[19:22:26] <max|2> doesn t work
[19:22:31] <max|2>  https://gist.github.com/4367304
[19:24:40] <LocalPCGuy> ?doesn't work @max|2
[19:24:40] <bot-t> max|2, What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[19:24:43] <max|2> oh
[19:25:14] <max|2> the position
[19:25:17] <max|2> it s important ?
[19:25:31] <max|2> for div and javascript ?
[19:27:08] <max|2> not work sorry
[19:29:51] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 you really need to learn a bit more about both CSS and JS (including jQuery) to be productive with things like this. No offense meant, but what you are trying to do is a fairly simple transition
[19:30:41] <max|2> yes i know with fade i sux with animate
[19:32:02] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 fade animates the opacity AND saves and sets the display property.  To replicate with animate, you need to set the display property (using .css()) first, then animate the opacity, then animate the other div and then set it's display property
[19:32:17] <wroathe> max|2: I have no idea what your trying to do but I'll upload a demo that should clarify things shortly.
[19:32:23] <wroathe> max|2: Just give me a few seconds.
[19:32:41] <max|2> oki
[19:34:09] <wroathe> max|2: http://jsfiddle.net/R5QbL/
[19:34:26] <wroathe> You can't really animate "display"
[19:35:14] <LocalPCGuy> wroathe he is trying to fade out 1 div and fade in another after the first fades out.  He's sent me the link twice, but I'm trying to help him understand how to figure this out rather than just provide the answer, which seems to be what he wants
[19:35:39] <max|2> i have fade it s ok
[19:35:40] <max|2> fade
[19:35:44] <max|2> but with safari
[19:35:52] <max|2> there are lag i need use framerate
[19:36:25] <wroathe> Yes max|2 you've made perfectly clear that you understand how to use one method of jQuery to animate an object and not another.
[19:36:46] <wroathe> max|2: Do you understand my demo?
[19:37:21] <max|2> i see
[19:39:16] <wroathe> LocalPCGuy: My demo is as close to answering his question as he's probably going to get in this channel.
[19:39:48] <LocalPCGuy> wroathe: yup, I actually posted a working example of his x-fade earlier today, but he must not have been paying attention
[19:40:01] <LocalPCGuy> wroate simplified of course
[19:52:27] <max|2> for animate you use just   <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js">
[19:52:28] <max|2> ?
[19:53:05] <wroathe> ...
[19:53:07] <wroathe> I give up
[19:53:28] <LocalPCGuy> :)
[19:54:06] <wroathe> Instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoPplpBPQxQ
[19:54:28] <max|2> no animate.js
[19:54:46] <wroathe> max|2: I'd wait and ask someone else. I've given up on you.
[19:55:57] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 here is the jsfiddle I posted earlier http://jsfiddle.net/M6atN/23/
[19:56:00] <LocalPCGuy> enjoy
[19:57:23] <wroathe> max|2: It's not that people in here don't want to help, it's just that we don't want to do your homework for you.
[20:01:03] <LocalPCGuy> max|2 particularly if you are being paid to do this work :shudder:

[20:25:15] <apple10043> I have one question.
[20:26:40] <apple10043> Did you used fancybox jquery plugin?
[20:27:54] <LocalPCGuy> apple10043: do you have a more specific question about the plugin?  if so, just ask
[20:28:14] <apple10043> yes.
[20:28:48] <apple10043> I wanna fancybox plugin iframe option.
[20:29:17] <apple10043> How transfer get parmeters passing throught?
[20:30:19] <apple10043> How to use fancybox get parameters?
[20:30:48] <LocalPCGuy> apple10043 it should tell you in the fancybox documentation
[20:31:25] <LocalPCGuy> apple10043 http://fancybox.net/api
[20:31:42] <apple10043> oh I got it.
[20:33:40] <apple10043> Did loacalPGGuy know fancybox iframe option?
[20:34:16] <Archio> If I'm using $("#mydiv").append("<input type='text' value='" + mystring + "' />");, to put the contents of my string in the appended text input, how do I prevent single quotes (') in mystring from being cut off in the input?
[20:35:45] <Stephen> Archio \'
[20:36:36] <Archio> @Stephen I tried that, they still seem to be cut off.
[20:37:45] <Archio> If I alert(mystring) right beforehand, I see the correct value. However, if the string is "what a \' great day", I just see "what a" in the input.
[20:37:59] <Stephen> Ah, then try \\\'
[20:38:15] <Stephen> Could be it's getting 1 more decode in there
[20:38:44] <Archio> @Stephen Then I see "what a \" lol
[20:39:06] <Stephen> Are you opening the line with a single quote?
[20:39:13] <Stephen> Because it's getting matched somewhere
[20:39:17] <Archio> I'm opening it with a double quote.
[20:39:34] <Stephen> open with a single quote instead
[20:39:39] <Stephen> and escape out the double quotes
[20:40:15] <Stephen> If that works, then the code you are working in is currently wrapped in double quotes somehow.
[20:40:30] <Archio> Escape out the double quotes?
[20:40:38] <Stephen> same way
[20:40:39] <Stephen> \"
[20:40:47] <Stephen> then \\\"
[20:40:57] <Stephen> try both
[20:41:34] <Stephen> If all else fails, replace it with &quotel
[20:41:36] <Stephen> er
[20:41:38] <Stephen> If all else fails, replace it with &quote;
[20:43:20] <LocalPCGuy> Archio you can post a sample of your code at jsfiddle.net
[20:43:39] <Archio> Ok, I opened with single quotes and escaped all of the double quotes with \". But now the double quotes are cutting stuff off.
[20:44:13] <Stephen> Ok, then just use the &quote; replacement
[20:44:35] <Stephen> Sounds like you're escaping out dangerous characters at some point
[20:45:42] <Archio> http://jsfiddle.net/9MPxh/
[20:46:02] <Archio> I don't think I'm replacing any dangerous characters, since I'm creating the string right there.
[20:51:54] <trinadh> Archio: http://fiddle.jshell.net/VVLj4/ , is that what you are trying to achieve... ?
[20:52:09] <Archio> @Stephen Thanks, this ended up working: string.replace(/"/g, '&quot;').replace(/'/g, '&apos;').
[20:52:30] <Archio> I had to replace both single and double quotes with &quot; and &apos;, and it displayed fine in the input and post data
[20:59:28] <batanze> Hi. New to jQuery. Trying to POST some JSON AJAX request to a URL but that doesn't show up in the server side logs. What is it that I am doing wrong?
[21:00:00] <LocalPCGuy> batanze can you see the AJAX request in Chrome Inspector or Firebug (Net panel)?
[21:00:17] <LocalPCGuy> batanze should give you a good idea if it is firing correctly and if not, why
[21:03:10] <batanze> Iam firing it from Chrome jSconsole
[21:04:28] <batanze> It successfully executes and throws an Object.
[21:04:50] <batanze> BUT...there is nothing in the server side logs...as if that request never ever came.
[21:05:14] <LocalPCGuy> batanze check the response code - it could be cached
[21:05:15] <LocalPCGuy> ?
[21:06:12] <batanze> one sec
[21:06:53] <batanze> Funny...everything is null
[21:08:14] <batanze> Where would I find the response code?
[21:08:21] <LocalPCGuy> Net panel
[21:08:36] <LocalPCGuy> Network
[21:09:08] <batanze> one sec
[21:09:10] <batanze> checking
[21:09:33] <batanze> Pending
[21:10:47] <batanze> Why would it say that?!
[21:11:48] <LocalPCGuy> where does it say that?
[21:12:02] <LocalPCGuy> under status?
[21:13:04] <batanze> Status
[21:13:08] <batanze> Type
[21:13:14] <batanze> Time
[21:13:22] <batanze> everything says pending
[21:13:31] <LocalPCGuy> but yet the ajax call is successful?
[21:14:18] <LocalPCGuy> do you have a break point set?  or have Chrome set to break on errors?
[21:14:26] <batanze> no sir
[21:14:32] <batanze> how do I accomplish that?
[21:14:50] <batanze> Looks like the ajax call is just waiting...I wonder why.
[21:14:53] <LocalPCGuy> I'm just making sure it isn't stopped mid-script
[21:14:58] <batanze> Let me check nginx.conf
[21:15:03] <LocalPCGuy> so does the ajax call complete?
[21:15:18] <batanze> At the console, seems like it.
[21:15:49] <LocalPCGuy> I think you are on the right page then looking at the server config.  seems like something isn't returning correctly, or maybe not closing the connection...not sure
[21:16:19] <batanze> I see.
[21:16:45] <batanze> Let me strip down the nginx.conf location and take it one step at a time then.
[21:17:17] <batanze> Thanks for the help. I learned to look at the Network status. Cheers!
[21:17:23] <LocalPCGuy> cool

[22:56:05] <alyis> Is this possible to do in jquery?
[22:58:33] <trinadh> alyis: yes you can do that
[22:59:20] <alyis> do you know any examples of similar ideas?
[22:59:35] <alyis> I figured it was posible but I am very new to jquery
[23:09:43] <trinadh> alyis: just a min
[23:11:13] <alyis> No problem not in any rush. Was just a nice feature I had thought of for a project I am working on.
