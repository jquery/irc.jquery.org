[00:20:28] <cook1es> Can someone explain why row 13 returns values but not row 49 in http://pastebin.com/pctZjsSd ? Thanks all.
[00:21:01] <dirkpennings> where can I find what xhr.readyState can contain? I know 4 = ok, but what other values are there?
[00:22:22] <Cork> dirkpennings: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XMLHttpRequest#Attributes
[00:22:31] <cook1es> dirkpennings: www.google.com/search?q=xhr.readyState+can+contain second result worked for me.
[00:22:48] <Ivru> I know it's not the right place to ask, but mobile chann seems pretty dead, so I'm trying here
[00:22:55] <Ivru> I'm trying to load a page in case of error. So I'm binding the pageloadfail event and try to load a new page with this code: http://pastie.org/private/sexzvfpjixozeqfux0mha The problem is that my page get stuck with the "loading" alert
[00:23:03] <Ivru> any idea how to do that ?
[00:23:53] <dirkpennings> nvm, got it
[00:24:39] <Cork> cook1es: all i can say it should return the same value
[00:24:49] <Cork> cook1es: scoping should ensure that
[00:24:50] <Hierofant> lvru is "default" defined as a document?
[00:25:06] <cook1es> Cork: yep, it's really weird!
[00:26:11] <Ivru> Hierofant: yes
[00:26:51] <Ivru> when catching the pagebeforeshow event i got the correct url but the page just do not get displayed
[00:31:33] <Ivru> PERECil_: o/
[00:32:13] <Zerks> does anyone know how long I need to wait inbetwee setting .css('top') to be able to get the true offset with .position().top ?
[00:32:58] <Zerks> because if I do it right after, or even do a setTimeout for a second, the top position is the same as the css top value. but if I then check position().top using the console, it returns a lower amount (as I can see that it would from the display)
[00:33:11] <17WAAGR8B> hai , is there anyone know jquery image gallery plugins which enabling user to add more image to it ?
[00:35:04] <Zerks> oh I see, better idea would be to shove the function in the image's onload event
[00:35:10] <Zerks> this seems to work so far
[00:45:41] <seivan> What is the proper way 		$(JST["stream_user"]).prependTo("#activities").slideDown("slow") apparently does not do it, the console log shows it trying ti append a function
[00:46:42] <Cork> $(JST["stream_user"]).hide().prependTo("#activities").slideDown("slow");
[00:48:22] <cypha> can I pass a variable from one script to another within the same html file?
[00:48:40] <Cork> cypha: sure, just set a global varaible
[00:48:57] <Cork> cypha: javascript doesn't have a file scrope
[00:49:01] <Cork> *scope
[00:49:04] <cypha> Cork, will that cause issues for ajax?
[00:49:22] <Cork> async calls can overwrite each other ya
[00:49:27] <cypha> ok, cool
[00:49:43] <cypha> cuz I think I'll just make the json array returned freely available
[00:49:52] <cypha> then I can just print the variable using jquery.template
[00:50:11] <SugaSlide> aanyone know of a decent twitter / facebook wall social combined thingy for jquery?
[00:50:16] <cypha> i mean, within <script type="x-jquery-tmpl>
[00:50:28] <cypha> does that sound reasonable Cork?
[00:51:15] <Cork> cypha: i would personaly do the templating in the callback instead of going global
[00:51:20] <Cork> but ya, that works
[00:51:39] <Cork> (me puts as little as posible in the global scop)
[00:51:41] <cypha> Cork, but then I'd have to put every line in " "
[00:52:11] <cypha> i can't just use normal html, like I could within the <script> tag
[00:52:15] <Cork> cypha: can't you pass the varaibles to the template function?
[00:52:16] <cypha> unless I'm mistaken?
[00:52:25] <cypha> can I?
[00:52:27] <cypha> i dunno
[00:52:34] <cypha> that'd be perfect
[00:52:42] <cypha> how could I do that?
[00:53:10] <Cork> cypha: http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[00:53:29] <mattyh88> i've got this javascript to only allow numeric values: http://pastebin.com/wsmM0UgC
[00:53:29] <mattyh88> but whenever i type something in the input field with class "grid" it doesn't do anything .. in fact it doesn't even execute the other 2 functions that are beneath the numeric javascript line
[00:53:51] <cypha> Cork, and just don't use .appendTo or whatever?
[00:54:43] <cypha> like, what's with .appendTo("movieList");?
[00:54:43] <Cork> cypha: when you render just do $( "#myTemplate" ).tmpl( myData ).appendTo( "#target" );
[00:55:12] <cypha> but I just want ${myvariable} available anywhere within #myTemplate
[00:55:15] <cypha> why do I need a target?
[00:55:28] <cypha> no?
[00:55:35] <Cork> appendTo is where the rendered content to be put
[00:55:41] <Cork> ?appendTo
[00:55:41] <bot-t> .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[00:56:19] <cypha> oh, it doesn't just put it where the <script> tag is?
[00:56:35] <Cork> no
[00:56:48] <Cork> the script tag is a source, not a target
[00:57:03] <cypha> oh
[00:58:16] <cypha> so basically everytime I'll just have to make a id'd <div> out side of the script and just append to that
[00:58:23] <cypha> *an
[01:03:06] <mattyh88> someone here using the "numeric" plugin from texotela? i'm having problems with it, Internet Expl says it doesn't recognize the "numeric" method for my input field. and I have incluced the javascript file for the numeric plugin
[01:06:39] <cypha> what would $.tmpl mean?
[01:06:55] <17WAAGR8B> hi, it is possible to add image with javascript using AdGallery image plugin ?
[01:06:56] <Cork> template
[01:07:04] <Cork> ?.tmpl
[01:07:05] <bot-t> Cork, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[01:07:05] <cypha> jquery.tmpl...but how is jquery an object?
[01:07:22] <Cork> cypha: what do you mean?
[01:07:30] <cypha> $ = jquery?
[01:07:41] <Cork> you don't work on $
[01:07:51] <mooKoo> ?.data
[01:07:52] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[01:07:57] <Cork> you work on $('#template') where template is the id of your template
[01:08:50] <cypha> Cork, cuz I have a script that's doing $.tmpl(this.options.uploadTemplate, $.map(files, templatehelper))
[01:10:04] <cypha> so I'm wondering how $.tmpl works
[01:10:17] <Cork> cypha: check the documentation
[01:10:34] <Cork> the one that wrote the script doesn't use the core templating function
[01:10:48] <Cork> and extends with $.map(files, templatehelper) instead
[01:11:09] <cypha> Cork, what do you mean?
[01:11:13] <cypha> so he made up $.tmpl?
[01:11:19] <Cork> ?.tmpl @ cypha
[01:11:20] <bot-t> cypha, .tmpl() - Take the first element in the matched set and render its content as a template, using the specified data. http://api.jquery.com/tmpl/
[01:11:35] <cypha> ?matched set
[01:11:36] <bot-t> cypha, Traversing - http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/
[01:11:42] <Cork> "optionsAn optional map of user-defined key-value pairs. Extends the tmplItem data structure, available to the template during rendering."
[01:12:17] <SugaSlide> lol havent seen you in a while :P
[01:13:05] <cypha> Cork, yeah, I see that he extended it
[01:13:12] <cypha> with map
[01:13:39] <cypha> but what's with $.tmpl ? like if $ = jquery, what does $.tmpl mean?
[01:14:13] <Cork> cypha: if you don't give it a template it works on an empty string
[01:14:24] <Cork> as in no template
[01:14:37] <Cork> its then extended with template variables
[01:15:55] <cypha> Cork, ohh, i'm sorry, in this case $ is not jquery
[01:16:06] <Cork> should be
[01:16:20] <cypha> (function ($) {
[01:16:35] <Cork> <_<'
[01:16:35] <cypha> or does that still mean jquery?
[01:16:43] <Cork> whats at the other end?
[01:16:52] <Cork> })(jQuery) ?
[01:16:57] <cypha> yes
[01:17:01] <Cork> then yes it is
[01:17:02] <blackspotwiggins> cypha, lrn2closure
[01:17:06] <cypha> oh
[01:19:07] <cypha> blackspotwiggins, what?
[01:19:41] <cypha> Cork, why would someone do it like that instead of just doing function(JQuery)?
[01:19:59] <Cork> cypha: ensuring that $ is jQuery
[01:20:19] <blackspotwiggins> cypha, please look into what closures are and how they work
[01:20:20] <cypha> oh, i see
[01:20:28] <cypha> clever
[01:20:36] <Cork> standard
[01:20:42] <cypha> oh :)
[01:21:11] <Hopsy> hi cypha
[01:21:18] <Hopsy> and SugaSlide
[01:21:23] <cypha> hi
[01:21:26] <Hopsy> and Trisox
[01:21:34] <Trisox> heyz
[01:21:43] <Hopsy> :P
[01:22:57] <cypha> Cork, so what does appending to an empty string do?
[01:23:41] <Cork> cypha: i'm not sure its an empty string, but my point is it start with a blank template, and then adds it from the $.map
[01:24:59] <cypha> Cork, then why not use an empty variable?
[01:25:19] <cypha> what is significant about appending the .map stuff to jquery?
[01:25:24] <Cork> cypha: cause you need an object where .tmpl exist
[01:25:34] <Cork> cypha: the templating
[01:25:36] <cypha> oh
[01:26:02] <cypha> cuz my thought would be $(mypage).tmpl or whatever
[01:26:31] <Cork> no, you select the template, or nothing at all
[01:26:48] <cypha> or $
[01:26:49] <cypha> ?
[01:26:53] <cypha> 3rd choice?
[01:27:12] <cypha> or $ = nothing at all
[01:27:54] <Cork> cypha: the templating plugin just offers tmpl in two formats
[01:28:03] <Cork> one that takes a template, and one the doesn't
[01:28:06] <cypha> oh
[01:28:20] <Cork> no magic to it
[01:28:22] <cypha> so what's gonna happen with .map values?
[01:28:23] <Myx0x3> hey, ive removed an attribute, but i want to add the attribute later, how do i do this? check here: http://pastebin.com/xuQRqzy6
[01:28:34] <cypha> like where do they go if $ is nothing
[01:28:43] <cypha> how do they get printed to something?
[01:28:49] <cypha> or passed to something
[01:28:58] <Cork> cypha: sigh like i've said multible times, the extend
[01:29:03] <cypha> Cork, https://gist.github.com/e358f28b05663e9aa9f2
[01:29:26] <MichaelM> is it intended behaviour that when I sub jquery, like `var sub$ = jQuery.sub();` that I then cannot add any custom selectors to sub$?
[01:29:37] <Cork> Myx0x3: ya, that should work
[01:29:48] <Cork> Myx0x3: but uh... DON'T use onclick >-<'''
[01:30:00] <Cork> ?.click @ Myx0x3
[01:30:00] <bot-t> Myx0x3, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[01:31:04] <Cork> MichaelM: you should be sub$.fn
[01:31:53] <MichaelM> Cork, can I not use sub$.expr[':'] ?
[01:32:15] <MichaelM> or, does that just point back to the original $?
[01:32:43] <Cork> it should be a clone of the original class
[01:33:21] <MichaelM> the docs seem unclear about that: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.sub/
[01:33:29] <Myx0x3> Cork: i get: "Uncaught TypeError: Object subtype_CompricerFormInputRadioButton('subtype_private_id'); has no method 'apply'" now :S
[01:33:39] <blazento> if i had a progressbar, and i would like to dynamically fill it based on time, to take 5 seconds to fill.. i've tried the following but no luck. i doesn't actually increment  in this setTimeout... any other idea how to go about this? https://gist.github.com/1277577
[01:34:57] <MichaelM> Cork, I guess it isn't a "deep clone"? the docs say "All the methods on the sub'd version of jQuery will still point to the original jQuery."
[01:35:27] <whezz> hiho
[01:35:32] <MichaelM> so if I modify sub$.expr[':'], is that actually modifying the original jQuery?
[01:35:50] <blackspotwiggins> ?tias @ MichaelM
[01:35:50] <bot-t> MichaelM, Try It And See
[01:35:52] <cypha> Cork, ok, I have this script https://gist.github.com/83f312ca924441bf7bad would you suggest setting up loginforms within <script id=loginforms type="text/x-jquery-tmpl"> and using {{if data.username}} Hi ${data.username} {{else}} <input>...
[01:35:56] <seivan> Cork: Yeah that didn't do it
[01:36:21] <MichaelM> it appears that it does, bot-t. My question was whether that was the intented behaviour or not.
[01:36:30] <blackspotwiggins> ?bot @ MichaelM
[01:36:30] <seivan> Cork: HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: DOM Exception 3: A Node was inserted somewhere it doesn't belong.
[01:36:30] <bot-t> MichaelM, sentient but living in the machine locale.
[01:37:06] <Cork> MichaelM: not sure, and i don't have the time to dig into it, sorry
[01:37:11] <Cork> <-- at work
[01:37:29] <MichaelM> heh, me too. thanks anyway :)
[01:37:44] <whezz> jqnoob needs help ... lets say i create a element like this: var blah = $(<div>blubb</div>); how can I modify this element using the variable blah? for example i want to add something into the div ...
[01:37:57] <NodeX> d
[01:38:26] <NodeX> blah.attr("id","myid");
[01:38:29] <Cork> whezz: blah.append('hello')
[01:38:53] <whezz> Cork: that will put it into the div? รถ.รถ
[01:39:00] <Cork> whezz: yes
[01:39:08] <whezz> hmm
[01:39:22] <Cork> or if you want to replace everything in it .html('hello')
[01:39:45] <NodeX> it would be $('<div>blubb</div>') ... the quotes
[01:40:05] <whezz> and if the element is more complex, like <table><tr><td></td></tr></table> and i want it into the <td> part ...
[01:40:08] <NodeX> there is also shorthand var blah = $('</div>');
[01:40:21] <Cork> uh.. no
[01:40:24] <Cork> <div/>
[01:40:27] <NodeX> oolps
[01:40:27] <ravenzz> ^
[01:40:28] <NodeX> lol
[01:40:30] <NodeX> typo
[01:40:31] <Cork> the other is a broken close tag :D
[01:40:36] <NodeX> typo ^^
[01:41:17] <blackspotwiggins> whezz, http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/
[01:41:22] <pentarex> hey guys
[01:41:24] <ravenzz> whezz find('td:first').append('foo')
[01:41:29] <pentarex> I am having some issue with IE9
[01:41:37] <ravenzz> for eg.
[01:41:42] <pentarex> I cant make my call to the AJAX get
[01:41:57] <ravenzz> ?demo @ pentarex
[01:41:57] <bot-t> pentarex, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:42:32] <whezz> ravenzz: hmm ok ... so i need to use the find ... since i know the structure of my created element i thought theres maybe a way to direkty select the child i want to modify
[01:43:46] <whezz> analoge to using $('#sd > tr > td').append ... => using the variable instead of the selector
[01:44:02] <ravenzz> whezz without a real example i can't say more
[01:44:17] <ravenzz> yep basically you can
[01:44:36] <ravenzz> $('tr td', this).append()
[01:44:45] <ravenzz> or replace this with blah
[01:44:55] <whezz> aah ... lemme try that :) thank you
[01:45:58] <quicksilver> well if whezz wants direct children since he's using >
[01:46:09] <quicksilver> $(this).children('tr').children('td')
[01:46:45] <ravenzz> or find('> tr > td')
[01:46:56] <ravenzz> i don't know what he wants :p
[01:47:11] <quicksilver> me neither
[01:47:18] <quicksilver> perhaps he wants a kitten?
[01:47:28] <whezz> thanks for the ideas :) kittens are always welcome :))
[01:48:59] <quicksilver> whezz: http://www.banzaiturtle.com/xyzzy/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/cute-kitten.jpg
[01:49:18] <whezz> *melts* <g>
[01:50:16] <whezz> well my problem basically is: how to access child elements when not using a selector but a variable with a stored selection
[01:50:44] <whezz> but i got some ideas to try out ... thanks :)
[02:01:54] <whezz> hm
[02:02:06] <Hopsy> is it handy to use while 1 in javascript?
[02:05:18] <Cork> Hopsy: no, as it would lock the gui
[02:05:34] <Cork> (or freez if you prefer)
[02:05:47] <Hopsy> hmm, how do I solve then this stupid issue
[02:05:54] <Hopsy> I want a delay on each :\
[02:06:07] <Cork> setTimeout or setInterval with time 0
[02:06:09] <ravenzz> he can even break;
[02:06:30] <ravenzz> anyway yep setInterval
[02:06:31] <Hopsy> setInterval 0 ?
[02:06:45] <Hopsy> ?setInterval
[02:06:46] <bot-t> http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[02:07:36] <Cork> Hopsy: var handler = setInterval(function() { /* do your things */ if(done) { clearInterval(handler); } }, 0);
[02:08:05] <Hopsy> and what is done? does that exist?
[02:08:23] <Cork> its psudo code
[02:08:33] <Cork> you need to calculate that your self
[02:08:57] <Hopsy> where did you find this psudo code :p
[02:09:18] <Cork> or the one that i prefer var func = function() { /* do your thing */ if(!done) { setTimeout(func, 0); }}; setTimeout(func, 0);
[02:09:31] <Cork> Hopsy: wrote it
[02:22:10] <GreyTrilby> mornin' all
[02:23:11] <SaadIbrahim> hey guys
[02:23:17] <nVee> hey guys, using isNAN on a jquery .val() string which is "empty" returns false, why is this?
[02:23:44] <SaadIbrahim> I want first letter of my element to be bigger in size than the others
[02:23:58] <nVee> so, if my input is empty, isNaN still sees it as a number?
[02:24:00] <SaadIbrahim> i used first-letter pseudo slector in css to achieve that
[02:24:07] <SaadIbrahim> but i am suing cufon font replacment
[02:24:08] <SaadIbrahim> using
[02:24:12] <SaadIbrahim> and that aint working
[02:24:26] <SaadIbrahim> cufon: http://snpr.cm/ACl0IL.jpg
[02:24:38] <GreyTrilby> nvee - that would be my understanding, yes
[02:24:40] <SaadIbrahim> no cofun: http://snpr.cm/HRcY9K.jpg
[02:24:49] <SaadIbrahim> works without cufon
[02:25:45] <nVee> GreyTrilby: Is there a different function I can use to validate an input field to only be numeric?
[02:25:51] <cypha> if I return a json object data that contains--> { "user": {"username":"radtad", "first_name":"john"}, "someother_thing":"thisval"} ...what can I do to make the key's available within <script type="text/x-jquery-tmpl"> as {{user.username}} instead of {{data.user.username}}?
[02:26:17] <GreyTrilby> i use jquery.validate
[02:26:38] <GreyTrilby> http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[02:27:09] <GreyTrilby> i'm afraid I don't know isNAN
[02:29:04] <NodeX> isNAN = is Not A Number
[02:29:32] <Guest75143> hey doesnt anyone here know VBA
[02:29:44] <NodeX> try #vba
[02:29:52] <nVee> NodeX: well if an empty string is Not a Number, but returns false, it then says "" = number?
[02:30:03] <nVee> == :)
[02:30:12] <Guest75143> NodeX, theres no one in that channel.
[02:30:14] <NodeX> I dont know what you are on about nVee
[02:30:29] <NodeX> I have just signed into my bnc so I cant see anything past 5 mins ago
[02:30:32] <nVee> isNaN returns false on a empty string
[02:30:38] <nVee> ahhh okay :)
[02:30:42] <NodeX> [10:27:08] <GreyTrilby> i'm afraid I don't know isNAN
[02:30:49] <NodeX> to which I responded what I responded
[02:30:56] <nVee> sorry I was quering why isNaN returned false on a jquery.val() string when it is empty
[02:31:13] <NodeX> because it is Not a number lol
[02:32:16] <nVee> NodeX: well, false on Not a Number effectively says it is a number :)
[02:32:30] <nVee> a False NOT = true?
[02:32:47] <aaronmcadam> but NaN !== NaN
[02:32:52] <NodeX> the method is "isNAN"
[02:32:55] <aaronmcadam> it's the only object that doesn't equal itself
[02:33:05] <NodeX> so it will return true for anything that IS NOT an interger
[02:33:17] <NodeX> i.e an empty string
[02:33:29] <NodeX> but you are saying it returned false ?
[02:33:35] <aaronmcadam> you'd need isNaN( +jquery.val() )
[02:33:41] <NodeX> ^ ^
[02:33:46] <aaronmcadam> because val() returns a string
[02:33:59] <nVee> I tried this:
[02:34:07] <nVee> console.log(isNaN($("input[name='houseExpense']").val()));
[02:34:15] <nVee> it returned false, however, I posted nothing
[02:34:18] <aaronmcadam> you need to convert it to string
[02:34:20] <Cork> aaronmcadam: would prob go with parseInt(jquery.val(), 10) instead
[02:34:25] <Cork> aaronmcadam: its safer
[02:34:26] <NodeX> or parse int
[02:34:29] <aaronmcadam> yeah yeah
[02:34:46] <aaronmcadam> most of the time I'm just coverting
[02:34:54] <nVee> parseInt = new to me :)
[02:34:55] <aaronmcadam> not necessarily from an input
[02:35:05] <nVee> let me google that quick :)
[02:35:06] <aaronmcadam> yeah funny thing about parseInt
[02:35:16] <aaronmcadam> ?eval parseInt( '1cb')
[02:35:17] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: 1
[02:35:26] <aaronmcadam> ?eval parseInt( 'cb1')
[02:35:27] <jomofcw> Why doing $elementWrap = $('<div></div>');$elementSource.wrap($elementWrap);$elementWrap.html(); it return me an empty string instead of the HTML of $elementSource ? please.
[02:35:27] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: NaN
[02:35:39] <aaronmcadam> parseInt only works if the number appears first in the string
[02:36:28] <nVee> in my case it should ONLY be a number :)
[02:36:38] <nVee> let me try it quick :)

[02:36:50] <aaronmcadam> well yeah the + unary operator will work then
[02:37:15] <Cork> aaronmcadam: its better to block non numbers from ever ending up in the text field
[02:37:39] <aaronmcadam> yeah but point is, parseInt only works left to right
[02:37:57] <aaronmcadam> or if the number appears first
[02:37:59] <Trisox[work]> your left or my left?
[02:38:02] <Trisox[work]> ;)
[02:38:05] <NodeX> lol
[02:38:09] <aaronmcadam> so either way
[02:38:13] <Trisox[work]> haha
[02:38:47] <aaronmcadam> ?eval parseInt( '1c');  parseInt( 'c1');
[02:38:47] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: NaN

[03:24:28] <snoopy> if you call a method that binds to an event - in _any_ framework, what is the best practice to return false to the handler to stop the event going up?
[03:25:24] <snoopy> for instance, $('div').fancybox(...); on a button, and then trying to override the listener on the buttons parent
[03:25:46] <snoopy> I am listening to $('tr') for selections, and there is an action button inside the TR, which calls a fancybox
[03:25:51] <snoopy> but also calls the $(tr).
[03:34:15] <NodeX> snoopy .. stopPropagation() stops events bubbling
[03:34:25] <NodeX> preventDefault() prevents err the default action
[03:35:26] <clockwize_> hi guys, how do i require another javascript file form within a script?
[03:35:43] <clockwize_> i know i can do document.write to include another script tag, but is there a jquery helper for it or something similar?
[03:35:49] <snoopy> NodeX: I just thought to call fancybox manually from a click instead of using .fancybox()
[03:35:51] <snoopy> but what do you mean?
[03:36:05] <snoopy> preventDefault is a superset of functionality of stopPropagation isn't it?
[03:36:13] <logik-bomb> can I use $element.contents() and then $new_element.html() = $element.contents() ?
[03:36:24] <snoopy> but either way NodeX - where do I get access to event in .fancybox
[03:37:03] <regebro> Hi peoples! I'm working an a Widget (for date recurrence in fact) and I'm doing an ajax call to a server to get back a list of occurrences.
[03:37:10] <jomofcw> Is it right : I can't search in data from AJAX request fro an ID ? i.e. success:function(data){alert($(data).find('#myID'))} > 0
[03:37:17] <regebro> I'm then going to display those as a list with a delete box in the widget.
[03:37:35] <NodeX> snoopy : fancybox() is a jquery plugin so who knows
[03:38:03] <regebro> The question: What would you recommend as the way to display this list? Generate the HTML from JS? Use jqUery templates? Something else I haven't though about?
[03:38:24] <snoopy> NodeX: who knows what? how to access the event? yeah - but still a relevant question. hrm. ffs
[03:38:57] <NodeX> how is it .. is the chan called #fancyboc ?
[03:39:01] <NodeX> #fancybox **
[03:39:35] <NodeX> you asked this ... [11:25:23] <snoopy> for instance, $('div').fancybox(...); on a button, and then trying to override the listener on the buttons parent

[03:44:26] <vasilevich> hello
[03:44:45] <vasilevich> is it possible to generate a js code within html WHILE running the script itself?
[03:45:26] <jomofcw> ? .loadscript() @ vasilevich
[03:45:27] <bot-t> vasilevich, jQuery.getScript() - Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[03:45:28] <vasilevich> for instance, my jquery produces new elements with new names, i would like to make them clickable seperately, i would need to produce a new .click line
[03:45:43] <vasilevich> ohhh can i generate the code within the script?
[03:45:49] <vasilevich> within the javascript
[03:46:00] <jomofcw> vasilevich not the right way to do it
[03:46:10] <jomofcw> ? .live() @ vasilevich
[03:46:10] <bot-t> vasilevich, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[03:46:26] <vasilevich> ok i'll read it thanks
[03:49:22] <vasilevich> its a bit complicated
[03:49:39] <vasilevich> the script makes new elements every time
[03:49:41] <vasilevich> like
[03:49:48] <vasilevich> square1 square2 square3 etc
[03:49:53] <vasilevich> and each element has its own position
[03:50:08] <vasilevich> i would like to dynamically create functions for each element
[03:50:25] <vasilevich> to treat them diffrently
[03:50:59] <NodeX> use a class
[03:51:13] <vasilevich> i do use a class
[03:51:15] <vasilevich> my question is
[03:51:16] <jomofcw> vasilevich what those function will do ? The better way to do it is to give a comon class to each element, then to $('.comonClass').live('click',function(){});
[03:51:28] <NodeX> class="square" .... $().live('click'....
[03:51:42] <vasilevich> each element is generated like this:
[03:51:44] <jomofcw> NodeX +1
[03:51:54] <vasilevich> class="square"+var
[03:52:11] <vasilevich> and each run the var gets +1
[03:52:18] <jomofcw> vasilevich that's the old way to do it. Just use full jQuery
[03:52:21] <NodeX> but why ?
[03:52:34] <vasilevich> because i want to control their position seperately
[03:52:42] <vasilevich> and each click seperately
[03:52:44] <jomofcw> vasilevich in your function you could target the element on which you click with $(this)
[03:52:51] <vasilevich> i know
[03:52:53] <vasilevich> but what about
[03:53:07] <vasilevich> $(".square"+var).live(click...
[03:53:15] <jomofcw> use a mix f indexOf and what we said
[03:53:34] <jomofcw> that's an old way to do it srsly
[03:53:49] <jomofcw> indexOf will give you the poisition of the element so 1 2 3 etc
[03:54:07] <vasilevich> ok i'll see what it does
[03:54:45] <NodeX> vasilevich : I would hide a hidden input inside the things you are watching
[03:54:47] <vasilevich> when i search for .indexOf() it gives me .inarray
[03:55:13] <NodeX> then you can get to it with $(this).find('.your-hidden-class').val()
[03:55:50] <vasilevich> is it the same?
[03:55:53] <vasilevich> indexof and inarray?
[03:56:24] <NodeX> no
[03:56:26] <NodeX> not even close
[03:56:38] <vasilevich> when i search in jquery indexof there is no such thing =/
[03:56:51] <seutje> that's coz it's just plain javascript
[03:56:55] <seutje> ?g indexof mdn
[03:56:56] <bot-t> seutje, indexOf - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf
[03:58:22] <nail_> jQuery does use Array.indexOf for inArray() when it's available
[04:03:56] <vasilevich> the indexof thing is a replacment for creating new classname each time right?
[04:05:04] <vasilevich> very confused of all this
[04:05:13] <aaronmcadam> yes u are :D
[04:05:24] <aaronmcadam> yes nail_
[04:05:48] <aaronmcadam> nail_: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.inArray
[04:08:24] <soahccc> Hmm I just discovered that my list filter "plugin" does not work in IE. The reason is that element.text() dont gives me a text in IE. It gives me the following: http://www.project-production.de/chaos/images/Windows_7_%5Bwird_ausgef%C3%BChrt%5D-20111011-130816.jpg
[04:09:12] <vasilevich> hey
[04:09:17] <vasilevich> assuming i have 2 elements
[04:09:19] <vasilevich> one is called
[04:09:21] <vasilevich> square1
[04:09:23] <vasilevich> and the other
[04:09:24] <vasilevich> square2
[04:09:33] <whezz> hmm, can anyone reconnment me a good jquery forum?
[04:09:41] <vasilevich> can i recieve input from both of them with 1 function of .click(function)?
[04:09:48] <vasilevich> but
[04:09:58] <vasilevich> by detecting and inserting diffrent vars int othe function
[04:10:12] <vasilevich> for instance if its square1 x=1 and if its square2 x=2
[04:11:47] <NodeX> vasilevich : you're better off making a jsfiddle
[04:12:33] <vasilevich> okay i will do that

[04:20:20] <fat_Mike_IRC_tus> WOuld someone pls look at my countdown timer, it's supposed to count from 20 not -1 http://pastebin.com/DifDnLNp
[04:20:33] <fat_Mike_IRC_tus> morning karstenk1977_
[04:21:07] <ablomen> fat_Mike_IRC_tus, change line 10 to  parseInt($('#hideMsg span').text(), 10);
[04:23:09] <fat_Mike_IRC_tus> negative ablomen it's given me "NaN Seconds"
[04:23:49] <ablomen> fat_Mike_IRC_tus, what does console.log($('#hideMsg span').text()); give you?
[04:24:34] <fat_Mike_IRC_tus> what's console.log?
[04:24:56] <ablomen> fat_Mike_IRC_tus, that print's to your debugger
[04:25:22] <fat_Mike_IRC_tus> does it come with firefox or do I have to get it as an addon
[04:25:32] <ablomen> see http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[04:26:47] <karstenk1977_> How can I ask for the children lengh of one parent element?
[04:27:04] <fat_Mike_IRC_tus> I can't get past slide 1
[04:27:28] <ablomen> fat_Mike_IRC_tus, use left-right arrows
[04:27:40] <ablomen> (or scroll)
[04:27:43] <Cork> karstenk1977_: you mean the number of children?
[04:29:23] <fat_Mike_IRC_tus> thanks ablomen
[04:29:32] <fat_Mike_IRC_tus> next up. get firebug
[04:29:52] <karstenk1977_> yes
[04:30:07] <karstenk1977_> but of one element with he selector
[04:30:37] <Cork> karstenk1977_: parent.children().length
[04:32:46] <karstenk1977_> as example I have 4 ol and ever ol has 4 li, now I want to get 4 as result and not 16
[04:33:52] <karstenk1977_> jQuery('ol.scroll-products').children().lengh gives me 16 as result
[04:36:10] <Cork> jQuery('ol.scroll-products:first').children().length
[04:36:59] <jayflux> think i may have found a jQuery bug with chrome, but would love someone to take a look if thats ok
[04:37:19] <karstenk1977_> thanks
[04:37:37] <DragoneneWork> jayflux: in general, say what it is rather than asking to ask
[04:37:51] <DragoneneWork> more likely you'll catch somebody's attention that way
[04:37:54] <vasilevich> nodex are you here
[04:38:18] <jayflux> http://goo.gl/IYmvO
[04:38:25] <jayflux> the td on the left on chrome only goes half way donw
[04:38:37] <jayflux> but it should fill the height of its parent
[04:38:48] <jayflux> the script is here: http://jsfiddle.net/Sn9Fq/
[04:39:09] <jayflux> as you can see it takes the td's parent's height, then applies it to the child. in FF this works but in chrome it doesnt

[04:40:08] <fat_Mike_IRC_tus> got it ablomen, how do I put the code in consol log?
[04:41:03] <vasilevich> http://duckgamer.hopto.org/chessyking/js/jstesting.html
[04:41:06] <vasilevich> i have this code
[04:41:36] <vasilevich> http://jsfiddle.net/kGMyc/
[04:41:38] <vasilevich> source
[04:41:55] <vasilevich> is it possible to make so that
[04:42:00] <DragoneneWork> jayflux: can confirm that it doesn't work in chrome, but works in opera here
[04:42:11] <vasilevich> $('.square1').click(function() { would work like
[04:42:11] <DragoneneWork> however, I can't say why. Could be the rendering engine or your css as easily as jquery
[04:42:17] <vasilevich> for both square1 and square2
[04:42:21] <vasilevich> but output diffrent values
[04:42:23] <DragoneneWork> I'm afraid I don't have time to look into it further
[04:42:25] <jayflux> hmm what action should i take then DragoneneWork
[04:42:30] <jayflux> should i ask the dev channel
[04:42:34] <jayflux> it seems like a bug to me
[04:42:34] <perty> hey.. i'm having this issue with my $.ajax call. i'm trying to fetch something from a different subdomain, but it keeps calling the error function and i've no idea how to figure out what's going on with it
[04:42:51] <jayflux> or should i post a ticket
[04:43:00] <DragoneneWork> jayflux: are you sure the error is in jquery and not elsewhere?
[04:44:07] <jayflux> pretty sure DragoneneWork i can't see anything in the CSS that would be affecting it
[04:44:15] <jayflux> and you said yourself it works in other brwosders
[04:44:34] <jayflux> which is the same for me
[04:45:23] <seutje> vasilevich: are those duplicate IDs intentional?
[04:45:48] <seutje> think u have IDs and classes confused :x
[04:46:02] <DragoneneWork> well - sorry, I don't really know
[04:46:27] <vasilevich> no no
[04:46:29] <vasilevich> its not confused
[04:46:32] <vasilevich> look
[04:46:35] <vasilevich> i have a function
[04:46:37] <vasilevich> that generates
[04:46:40] <vasilevich> squares
[04:46:42] <vasilevich> in such fashion:
[04:46:47] <vasilevich> square1
[04:46:48] <vasilevich> square2
[04:46:50] <vasilevich> etc etc
[04:46:57] <vasilevich> and i would like to be able to recieve clicks from each square
[04:46:59] <vasilevich> seperately
[04:47:08] <vasilevich> without making a new line
[04:47:09] <NodeX> vasilevich : enter is not punctuation
[04:47:15] <Ivru> a function that generate carriage return also
[04:47:16] <seutje> so it's intentional that ur IDs are not unique, but ur classes are? o.O
[04:47:22] <Weedjo> sorry to post it again: I've got such a string "http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/274222_100002895945078_4856269_q.jpg" and I only want to have the ID '100002895945078'. Any idea how to extract this?
[04:47:29] <vasilevich> yes it is intentional
[04:47:41] <NodeX> Weedjo : 1 sec I'll give you the funciton
[04:47:49] <Weedjo> thanks :) @Nodex
[04:47:56] <seutje> vasilevich: then I don't think I can help you without feeling nasty about myself
[04:47:56] <vasilevich> i need a way to get input from both of the squares (or more) at the same place
[04:48:24] <NodeX> infact .... is it dynamic you need it or the URL always the same ?
[04:48:32] <Weedjo> mom
[04:48:34] <vasilevich> url is the same
[04:48:48] <vasilevich> the only thing i need is control over each new element
[04:48:50] <NodeX> @ Weedjo
[04:49:35] <vasilevich> i was thinking to add another line of code dynamically to the js while the function that creates each new square runs but i have no idea how to do that
[04:50:23] <vasilevich> my main problem is the input thats all
[04:50:39] <Weedjo> @ NodeX : This part is always the same "http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/" the numbers are always different. But I only need the 10000... part between the underlines _ _
[04:51:08] <NodeX> do the "_" shift - i.e is it always int eh same place
[04:51:12] <NodeX> in the *
[04:51:44] <Weedjo> ?
[04:52:06] <NodeX> do the underscores move - i.e is that number you want always int eh same place in the string
[04:52:08] <NodeX> in the *
[04:52:28] <Weedjo> no they're not another example string is : "...41389_100000488403123_6378_q.jpg"
[04:53:00] <NodeX> but it's always second ?
[04:53:07] <Weedjo> yes
[04:53:20] <Weedjo> ah ok, sorry that's what you meant... I misunderstood you ;)
[04:53:21] <NodeX> right so they are then lol
[04:53:28] <Weedjo> yes^^ sorry
[04:55:40] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/EeqhX/
[04:56:12] <NodeX> "wanted" is your variable
[04:56:57] <fat_Mike_IRC_tus> Guys why does this work here http://jsfiddle.net/GNrUM/2/ but not in my script. it defaults to -1 and counts down from there http://pastebin.com/DifDnLNp

If I do $.each({foo: "bar"}, function (k, v) { console.log(k) }); I see "foo" printed to the console, as expected. If I replace the literal map however with "data.item", nothing is printed out. If I dump "data.item" to the console with the REPL (Chromium), I can see it does have 6 properties
[04:57:14] <ocharles> any idea what I'm missing?
[04:57:53] <Weedjo> @ NodeX : I don't see "wanted" and I only need this part "100000488403123"
[04:58:20] <Weedjo> are you sure u send me the right link? ;)
[04:58:49] <Weedjo> I get this at your version "274222_100002895945078_4856269_q.jpg"

[04:59:42] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/EeqhX/1/
[04:59:53] <NodeX> it saved it in my cache not the site
[05:00:10] <Weedjo> awesome!!! :)
[05:00:15] <ablomen> fat_Mike_, oh i see it now btw, you have put the script in the head, so put $(document).ready(function ( ) { ... }); around it
[05:00:15] <Weedjo> thanks a lot Nodex :)
[05:00:28] <NodeX> yw - not really jquery but nps lol
[05:00:52] <fat_Mike_> thanks ablomen I'll give that a try
[05:00:56] <ablomen> fat_Mike_, the span tag is not created yet when the code executes now
[05:05:03] <fat_Mike_> THANK YOU ablomen
[05:05:51] <ocharles> Oh nice, $.each({length: "2:20"}, function(k, v) { console.log(k) }); doesn't work, because jQuery thinks the map is actually an array with length "2:20"
[05:06:22] <ocharles> oh hrm, that is documented
[05:06:23] <ocharles> yuck.
[05:07:14] <aaronmcadam> i've gotten keys form obj literals before
[05:07:40] <Weedjo> Sometimes the node doesn't exist and I only get the string "undefined" when I alert it. how can i check for this case? I tried if(str == "undefined") but this doesn't work
[05:08:50] <aaronmcadam> if ( str ) will return true for any non-empty string
[05:09:01] <Weedjo> ok thanks :)
[05:09:21] <aaronmcadam> but if str itself is undefined as a variable, that's another thing
[05:09:52] <aaronmcadam> Weedjo: and you should be using firebug for debugging see ?ftjq

[05:10:22] <Weedjo> thank you all :) I'll look at it
[05:10:52] <juria_roberts> How do I get value of the jquery eyecon colorpicker when I hide the colorpicker?
[05:11:00] <juria_roberts> http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/
[05:11:23] <aaronmcadam> read the docs?
[05:11:34] <aaronmcadam> that's what you're expecting us to do juria_roberts
[05:11:38] <juria_roberts> yeah the code example
[05:12:14] <juria_roberts> aaronmcadam: cudnt find the docs
[05:12:41] <aaronmcadam> surely if u just select the element you'd activated colorpicker on
[05:12:49] <aaronmcadam> console.dir that element
[05:12:59] <aaronmcadam> and check it's colorpicker property
[05:13:05] <aaronmcadam> there should be docs for it
[05:21:06] <jomofcw> Any issue about using $(data).find('#myID') where data come in a success AJAX function, and #myID is an existing ID in data AND in the default document ?
[05:22:04] <juria_roberts> aaronmcadam: there is a val funtion but it returns an empty string?
[05:22:11] <aaronmcadam> what?
[05:22:24] <aaronmcadam> val will return empty if there's nothing in the input
[05:25:59] <juria_roberts> there is a val
[05:30:53] <nul> I've done $.ajax() with the proper url, and a success function which takes (data)... how do I grab the raw text of whatever it gets?  it becomes a kind of object, I'm not sure how to access it.  Any help would be greatly appreaciated -- it's been a long night, save me some googling (will be googling while waiting)
[05:31:43] <nul> even the datatype of data would help me tremendously
[05:32:26] <jomofcw> ? .ajax() @ nul
[05:32:26] <bot-t> nul, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[05:32:41] <jomofcw> look at the success function
[05:32:49] <nul> yeah, I dunno why it's not working
[05:32:54] <nul> I just read up more, I'm doing it right
[05:33:14] <nul> set the proper url, then it doesn't change the HTML content into what I asked for
[05:35:03] <jomofcw> nul your code ?
[05:35:05] <nul> sec
[05:35:13] <nul> ok ill pastebin it
[05:35:29] <nul> http://pastebin.com/V6HLxG8D
[05:35:31] <jomofcw> nul ajax won't change anything if you do not write the change in the success function
[05:35:32] <nul> probably dumbest thing ever
[05:35:50] <nul> small semicolon or some shit :P
[05:35:55] <jomofcw> have you tried to console.log your data ?
[05:36:05] <nul> nope.. I will now I suppose
[05:36:10] <jomofcw> yea ;)
[05:36:34] <jomofcw> data should be a full HTML doc. So with html tag, head tag and so more.
[05:36:44] <jomofcw> You can't just append it in an element
[05:36:52] <jomofcw> you should parse it and get only what you need.
[05:36:55] <nul> is there any way to do that then?
[05:37:04] <nul> this is a half-assed way of getting my client music on every page =/
[05:37:10] <nul> or um
[05:37:14] <nul> do I just need <html> and </html> inside?
[05:37:15] <juria_roberts> aaronmcadam: thanks after looking into console.dir i figured it out
[05:37:35] <jomofcw> nul depend on what you want to do and what data is.
[05:37:44] <nul> jomofcw: the whole page, minus the music box ;p
[05:37:45] <jomofcw> But I have a relative question :
[05:37:48] <jomofcw> Any issue about using $(data).find('#myID') where data come in a success AJAX function, and #myID is an existing ID in data AND in the default document ?
[05:38:02] <jomofcw> If any expert know something about that here :).
[05:38:09] <nul> hm?
[05:38:46] <NodeX> jomofcw : yes it;s possible
[05:42:46] <jomofcw> NodeX thanks for your answer. What is possible ? The fact there are issues about that ?
[05:43:24] <nul> NodeX: so is there any way to put my HTML in there without it being -perfect-?
[05:43:34] <nul> NodeX: it's not data, it's HTML.. but it's perfectly valid HTML afaik
[05:44:13] <NodeX> err ?
[05:44:19] <nul> err
[05:44:33] <nul> what are the requirements for it to be imported as full HTML?
[05:44:34] <NodeX> nul ? ... I did'nt see your question
[05:44:40] <nul> okay for ajax
[05:44:53] <nul> oh nevermind, you weren't the one answering me before
[05:45:00] <NodeX> obvisouly not lol
[05:45:02] <nul> haha
[05:45:03] <nul> oops ;)
[05:45:03] <Burgov> hi
[05:45:04] <nul> tired
[05:45:16] <Burgov> does jQuery support validation of HTML5 forms?
[05:45:28] <NodeX> not nativly Burgov
[05:45:51] <Burgov> NodeX: so i'd need a plugin for that then?
[05:45:56] <NodeX> yup
[05:46:05] <Burgov> NodeX: do you have a suggestion?
[05:46:23] <Burgov> i see quite a lot of them on google...
[05:46:26] <nul> if I want to import HTML data ajax from another file (eg about.html) directly into a DIV, is there any best way of doing this?
[05:46:38] <ic_johns1on> if I want to add several <canvas></canvas> into a specific <div>, should I use the append() method?
[05:47:31] <NodeX> sorry Burgov : I do all my validation server side
[05:48:05] <Burgov> NodeX: ok, thanks anyway
[05:48:35] <NodeX> I woudl be surprised if the current ones dont support it
[05:51:23] <nul> $.ajax(url: 'somepage.html', success: function(data, status, xhr) { $('.main_content').html(data); } // why does this not work? :(
[05:51:27] <solidus-river> is there a way to attach a live event to a select tag that calls a function when the user makes a selection?
[05:54:25] <jomofcw> nul, if I could answer your question, I should be able to answer mine ^^.
[05:54:34] <jomofcw> I will do some test about well formating HTML
[05:54:55] <seutje> nul: try specifying the return type
[05:54:56] <nul> heheh
[05:55:03] <nul> seutje: I'm trying with .load() I think that works better
[05:55:41] <nul> ahh
[05:55:42] <seutje> that's prolly coz load assumes a return type
[05:55:43] <nul> it worked instantly
[05:55:44] <nul> woot
[05:56:12] <seutje> thank god for convenience methods, without them, u might actually learn a thing or 2
[05:56:51] <nul> lol
[05:56:56] <nul> what return type do I need?
[05:57:06] <seutje> html I suppose
[05:57:20] <nul> hmrm
[05:57:23] <nul> I tried string, didn't like it
[05:57:28] <nul> html is all I needed, good to know
[05:58:45] <warrenparsons> solidus-river: Why not just live bind the change event on the select?
[05:58:57] <r3v3rb> hello

[06:00:05] <jomofcw> My HTML has no error :/.
[06:00:08] <aaronmcadam> juria_roberts: well done!
[06:00:14] <jomofcw> Hello seutje :). Probably your experience could help me...
[06:00:22] <juria_roberts> aaronmcadam: thanks :)
[06:00:24] <aaronmcadam> Probably :P
[06:01:08] <seutje> jomofcw: this is my first day using the jQueries
[06:01:14] <solidus-river> warrenparsons: yeah thats the method i'm going with, now its just time to write 3 ajax view handlers in ruby and i can sleep soundly
[06:01:34] <jomofcw> I'm trying to do $('#myID',data); data come in a success AJAX function. #myID also exists in the default document. it doesn't find anything, but the element <div id="myID"> exists :/.
[06:01:42] <kborchers> seutje: that's spelled jaqueries ;)
[06:01:47] <jomofcw> seutje LoL :P ! haimen ;)
[06:01:57] <ic_johns1on> when I use the .effect("scale", {}, 1000); it wont scale from the origin. When the scaling animation is complete it moves back to it's original spot. Is there some parameters I could use or is there a trick?
[06:02:33] <seutje> jomofcw: that is odd, can u create an isolated test case?
[06:03:00] <seutje> I'll brb, dire need of some nicotine -_-
[06:03:11] <warrenparsons> I'm in your jaqueries, breaking your codez... ?
[06:06:03] <jomofcw> seutje i'll try during your nicotine time
[06:11:21] <jomofcw> seutje : http://jsfiddle.net/KP2Mf/3/
[06:11:28] <jomofcw> it does exatly the same.
[06:18:04] <ic_johns1on> when I scale a <div> from origin ['middle','center'] it jumps right back to the original place once it scaled
[06:18:24] <kborchers> ?demo @ ic_johns1on
[06:18:24] <bot-t> ic_johns1on, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:18:39] <ic_johns1on> thanks, will do
[06:20:29] <NodeX> jomofcw .. the second paramter is context and I dont think data is an actual object as such
[06:21:37] <NodeX> and in your JS fiddle foo already exists
[06:21:49] <jpulgarin> Can anybody tell me what side effects this line of code will have? http://pastie.org/2676837

[06:22:18] <wilfredh> hi all
[06:22:33] <wilfredh> can anyone tell me why I can't use .live() after .filter()? http://jsfiddle.net/amA3h/
[06:22:52] <NodeX> jpulgarin : it's ambiguous
[06:23:13] <NodeX> it's setting itself to itself
[06:23:15] <jpulgarin> @NodeX: Something is not working after that line, and I'm wondering what types of things to look out for
[06:23:24] <jpulgarin> @NodeX: Right, how can that have a side effect?
[06:23:31] <kborchers> wilfredh: don't use live
[06:23:50] <Anticom> hi all
[06:23:58] <Anticom> i want to write a simple highlighter script for mouseovers
[06:23:59] <NodeX> is there some mad reason I don't know about why people keep saying don't use live() ?
[06:24:20] <ic_johns1on> http://jsfiddle.net/r9FQG/ I can't really get my code working here. Is the text in the javascript frame included or not? :S
[06:24:38] <kborchers> it sucks ... all of your events have to bubble to the document before your handler is called ... use delegate instead NodeX
[06:24:53] <wilfredh> kborchers: it's part of a larger script that is applied to a form that is changed with JS. So as I understand it I need live()?
[06:25:35] <wilfredh> so is there something in my example that stops the event propagating?
[06:26:16] <Anticom> is there a way to select only the dom element, which is triggert on .mouseenter() but fire that event everytime the mouse moves?
[06:26:49] <kborchers> wilfredh: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/amA3h/1/
[06:27:12] <seutje> jomofcw: awkward as hell, but seems to work: http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/KP2Mf/15/
[06:27:45] <wilfredh> kborchers: thanks. I don't understand why .live() doesn't work though
[06:28:07] <jomofcw> NodeX context could be a string.
[06:29:07] <NodeX> I dont think so
[06:29:29] <NodeX> I'll happily admit I am wrong if the docs say it can though
[06:29:55] <NodeX> contextA DOM Element, Document, or jQuery to use as context
[06:31:22] <jomofcw> NodeX you're right. Anyway $(data).find('#myID') doesn't work anymore.
[06:31:37] <NodeX> i didnt think it woiuld
[06:31:45] <jomofcw> htmlA string of HTML to create on the fly. Note that this parses HTML, not XML.
[06:31:59] <jomofcw> It should
[06:32:00] <kborchers> wilfredh: probably has to do with the way live handles that selector when you send it a finite set of elements. this works but you should use the delegate version i sent earlier http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/amA3h/2/
[06:32:12] <NodeX> data is nit an object
[06:32:17] <NodeX> is not *
[06:32:33] <NodeX> it's the responseText iirc
[06:33:06] <NodeX> and wrapping it in jQuery will not turn it into one lol
[06:34:03] <jomofcw> $('<div></div>') : '<div></div>' isn't an object, right ?
[06:34:18] <NodeX> yes
[06:34:28] <NodeX> differnt context
[06:34:54] <NodeX> $("<div></div>") is an object ...
[06:35:16] <kborchers> ic_johns1on: the point is to create a reduced test case in jsfiddle to narrow down where the problem is. just pull out the pieces of your code that do the scaling and get that working in a fiddle. then you'll probably see it isn't an issue with scale but something else in your code
[06:35:30] <jomofcw> NodeX imagine data is '<div></div>', so there $(data) and $('<div></div>') is the same, nop ?
[06:36:03] <NodeX> I am not sure it goes multiple levels deep
[06:36:11] <ic_johns1on> kborchers: I have to use css for the element to have *some* height and width, and after that comes the scaling part
[06:36:12] <jomofcw> NodeX true
[06:36:21] <ic_johns1on> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/r9FQG/1/
[06:36:23] <NodeX> <div></div> = ok .. <div><span></span></div> not ok
[06:36:30] <NodeX> but I could be wrong
[06:36:34] <seutje> jomofcw: think u'd need filter in that case
[06:36:43] <jomofcw> NodeX you're wrong just an the last example, but right on each other.
[06:37:01] <jomofcw> I think the prob is I'm trying to create an element that is a document in another default doc context.
[06:37:27] <seutje> jomofcw: http://jsfiddle.net/seutje/KP2Mf/19/ works
[06:37:46] <seutje> jquery doesn't care much about head & body I guess
[06:38:15] <seutje> so piping data into a jquery collection, makes it a collection of multiple elements, not a collection of just the <html> element

[06:41:34] <fat_Mike_> need help figuring out why the concatenate result of $num and $target is counted down rather than counting them down indivdually. http://pastebin.com/ZXnRKWZ1
[06:41:59] <seutje> jomofcw: heh, isn't that the thing I gave u before I revised it?
[06:42:05] <kborchers> ic_johns1on: so. is the problem that it jumps after the scale?
[06:42:28] <seutje> blentu: try brackets when ur object properties have funky names
[06:42:59] <jomofcw> seutje yep :P ! It is ^^ I just make few test on chaining find
[06:43:13] <blentu> seutje can you give me an example please?
[06:43:25] <jomofcw> seutje because my prob is that I can't chain any find anyway in the first case :/
[06:44:37] <seutje> blentu: foo['รพฤงโยขฤธโฌรฐโรพ!']
[06:44:57] <NodeX> fat_Mike_ that really makes no sense as a quesiton
[06:44:58] <jomofcw> seutje http://jsfiddle.net/KP2Mf/23/ it works ! Thanks dude ^^.
[06:45:20] <seutje> there's more to life than chaining

[06:47:00] <fat_Mike_> NodeX, ty, I'm trying to count down the values in the variables $num and $target. But instead it counts down $target . $num twice
[06:47:19] <blentu> hmm could you check please http://jsfiddle.net/V359h/
[06:48:26] <NodeX> because your starting var is local to the funciton and the setInterval has another function scpe inside it
[06:48:29] <NodeX> scope*
[06:48:41] <jayflux> i have some jquery which works in the console but doesnt work when put in a script
[06:49:24] <seutje> I sense a doc rdy issue

[06:49:46] <NodeX> var sec = ... -> sec =
[06:49:54] <seutje> jayflux: put it at the bottom of the page or wrap it in a $(function() {   });
[06:50:03] <NodeX> or just put it inside the timer
[06:50:39] <jeffsmykil> can you return an object?
[06:50:43] <NodeX> infact I am surprised it works seeing as it never knows the starting number
[06:51:02] <NodeX> jeffsmykil :>
[06:51:04] <NodeX> ?
[06:51:06] <NodeX> **
[06:51:14] <fat_Mike_> If i told you I'm searching the web and adopting what i see, it's why I got no clue whats going on
[06:51:29] <jeffsmykil> var foo = getBarObject();
[06:51:35] <jeffsmykil> return foo;
[06:51:42] <NodeX> you basically want a timer to countdown from a start you decide from php ?
[06:51:48] <fat_Mike_> correct
[06:52:32] <NodeX> 1 sec
[06:52:38] <fat_Mike_> np thx Nodex
[06:53:01] <jayflux> nope seutje

[06:54:48] <ic_johns1on> kborchers: yes, the problem is that it jumps back. i know why it does that. i was simply asking what the best method to use is, for not making it jump back
[06:55:05] <blentu> http://jsfiddle.net/V359h/ please help...i tried to explain
[06:55:09] <seutje> jayflux: function() {} doesn't work in my console either

[06:56:05] <jayflux> seutje:  the last jq function
[06:56:06] <jayflux> refresh
[06:56:17] <kborchers> ic_johns1on: i think if you absolute position it so it doesn't respect that margin, then it would work. if that's not an option, maybe just scale right and down instead of from the center
[06:56:47] <fat_Mike_> negative nodex, acting crazier
[06:57:13] <NodeX> works fine for me
[06:57:20] <NodeX> counts down from 60 to 0 then fades out
[06:58:16] <ic_johns1on> kborchers: it has to scale from the center. iam going to use several canvas elms to make a css dock menu, sort of
[06:58:56] <ic_johns1on> kborchers: abs pos does not work. it was in my original example, but u told me to cut script short.
[06:59:00] <jeffsmykil> kborchers do i have to return an object created on a heap in js if I don't want garbage?
[06:59:30] <fat_Mike_> it works as well, and with one php varable, but not when I have it applied to two variables in php.
[07:00:13] <NodeX> err
[07:00:47] <NodeX> that's because it's returned an array of elements
[07:00:49] <NodeX> 1 sec
[07:00:57] <fat_Mike_> k
[07:01:51] <kborchers> ic_johns1on: you'll just have to keep playing with css then but getting rid of that jump may be tricky
[07:03:57] <NodeX> fat_Mike_ is it 2 timers you need
[07:04:01] <NodeX> or is it variable
[07:04:30] <seutje> jayflux: jshint is telling me there's a ton of missing semicolons, perhaps that's the cause
[07:04:47] <seutje> jayflux: did u just comment it out? o.O
[07:05:04] <jayflux> yeah ive binned the jquery idea off i will just use oveflow hidden
[07:05:05] <fat_Mike_> hmm Nodex, ok I'll look into it
[07:05:08] <jayflux> it obviously wasnt working
[07:05:13] <jayflux> but workd in the console
[07:05:16] <NodeX> there is nothing to look into
[07:05:20] <NodeX> it's a simple question
[07:06:23] <seutje> jayflux: shit just wasn't being called coz there's some syntax issues, but alright
[07:06:31] <ic_johns1on> kborchers: i think i have to apply new set off css rules to that scaled version, how can i do that? addClass / removeClass? i started using jQuery today with not so good kb on js even...
[07:06:33] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: not sure what you're asking. are you worried about memory allocation in JS? not sure you have much control over that. you technically allocate memory when you create an object (i think)
[07:06:53] <jeffsmykil> but returning an object should work kborchers ?
[07:07:13] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: what do you mean by "return"?
[07:07:38] <jeffsmykil> var foo = myFunc();
[07:07:38] <fat_Mike_>  the learning curve is too steep for me, trying hard
[07:07:59] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/mYKDF/5/
[07:08:00] <b1lly> how do i unset a css property with jquery?
[07:08:02] <jeffsmykil> kborchers: ^^^
[07:08:19] <jomofcw> Is it possible to chain animation on differente element ? i.e. set the animation in the same queue for two element, that result in the first element move then when the first finished, the second move. Or should I use callback (but I have something like 5 elements to move :/) ?
[07:08:32] <kborchers> and you return some object from myFunc? that's how js works, yes
[07:08:40] <NodeX> $("#billy").css("border","none")
[07:08:51] <robinsmidsrod> is there a reason $('<button type="button" />', { 'disabled':'disabled' }) doesn't work on FF 7.0.1, while $("<button/>", { 'type':'button','disabled':'disabled' }) does work?
[07:08:52] <jeffsmykil> k i though i read somewhere you could return simple arrays but not objects
[07:09:41] <robinsmidsrod> using jQuery 1.6.4
[07:09:49] <kborchers> jeffsmykil: and array is an object ;)
[07:09:54] <jeffsmykil> yeah i know
[07:10:09] <jeffsmykil> i dont know why this is confusing me so bad, probably because I cant get it to work lol
[07:11:25] <snax> does jQuery have a syntax that by itself cannot be parsed by javascript?
[07:11:26] <fat_Mike_> THANK YOU NodeX
[07:11:33] <NodeX> it's broke
[07:11:36] <NodeX> I'm fixing it
[07:11:43] <kborchers> snax: jQuery is JavaScript
[07:11:58] <snax> kborchers: even the API interface ?
[07:12:10] <snax> what javascript construct is $() ?
[07:12:31] <robinsmidsrod> it's a function call on a variable named  $
[07:12:37] <seutje> an object :D
[07:12:56] <kborchers> i'm surrounded by objects
[07:12:59] <fat_Mike_> didn't know you could hop over hideMsg Id  and straight to  .countdown
[07:13:21] <NodeX> .countdown = classname
[07:13:21] <seutje> ?eval jQuery instanceof Object
[07:13:22] <bot-t> seutje: true
[07:13:26] <seutje> SEE?! :P
[07:13:34] * troubleman is now watching: http://english.aljazeera.net/watch_now/
[07:14:05] <fat_Mike_> yes
[07:14:56] <jomofcw> Is it possible to chain animation on differente element ? i.e. set the animation in the same queue for two element, that result in the first element move then when the first finished, the second move. Or should I use callback (but I have something like 5 elements to move :/) ?
[07:16:29] <NodeX> fat_Mike_ : you wil be better off with a plugin
[07:16:51] <seutje> ?queue @ jomofcw
[07:16:51] <bot-t> jomofcw, .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[07:18:12] <fat_Mike_> Nodex, could you kindly explain why that is ?
[07:19:46] <jomofcw> seutje perhaps I'm wrong but I cant apply the same queue on diferent element (moving one, the moving the second)...
[07:20:36] <jayflux> seutje: try now
[07:20:39] <jayflux> still don't work
[07:20:40] <jayflux> clean code too
[07:23:20] <NodeX> fat_Mike_ : I will make you an example just give me a minute to finish somehting
[07:24:05] <fat_Mike_> dude your AMAZING
[07:26:23] <NodeX> fat_Mike_ : http://jsfiddle.net/mYKDF/21/
[07:27:03] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/mYKDF/22/ <-- cleaner
[07:27:17] <Weedjo> Hey everyone. I'm changing my url with "window.location.href ". After that I want to get access to the DOM. But my code is trying to access the code before the DOM is finished loading. How can I wait that long? I tried $(document).ready(function() but it seems that this works only once...
[07:27:46] <quicksilver> Weedjo: as far a I know, you can't.
[07:28:00] <fat_Mike_> thanks Nodex, waiting for jfiddle to load
[07:28:00] <NodeX> can you pastebin / fiddle your code
[07:28:03] <quicksilver> page change = all javascript finishes
[07:28:14] <quicksilver> new stuff runs in a fresh context.
[07:28:36] <quicksilver> if you want to keep your existing context, use AJAX or something horrid with (I)FRAMEs
[07:29:32] <fat_Mike_> Nodex another dumb question. What's the difference?
[07:29:49] <NodeX> I cleaned the code up lol
[07:30:10] <Weedjo> here is the code: http://pastie.org/private/klvpaixprrevcvgnxgupa
[07:30:32] <fat_Mike_> lol, I mean't with the previous one you made before these two
[07:30:40] <NodeX> http://jsfiddle.net/mYKDF/23/
[07:30:54] <NodeX> use that - it will work on IE (forgot to remove a non IE var)
[07:31:33] <NodeX> the one I made is a plugin of which you feed it a list of elemnets classes or ID's with numbers and it counts them down
[07:31:42] <NodeX> and fades out when they get to zero
[07:32:36] <fat_Mike_> cool!, on a scale of 1 to 10, do you think I can make it display days, hrs, seconds?
[07:32:57] <m4xx> can someone tell me why the proxy() call to methods.strobe never gets fired? http://jsfiddle.net/PDwPX/
[07:33:04] <NodeX> it counts down every second so no
[07:33:38] <NodeX> what you would be better off doing is (waste of memory but anyway) call an ajax request to a php script every second and have PHP spit out the current time
[07:34:50] <fat_Mike_> Why can't i get it to do something like this ?http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html
[07:35:27] <NodeX> you can if you want to, I wont be making you an example for that though
[07:35:31] <NodeX> just use his code
[07:35:55] <edzjins> hi
[07:36:02] <alaing> hi
[07:36:09] <fat_Mike_> Nodex, you've been GREAT. THANK YOU
[07:36:23] <edzjins> anybody been working with .scroll() ?
[07:36:28] <NodeX> yw, good luck :)
[07:36:29] <edzjins> trying to understand it.
[07:36:44] <NodeX> not for a while edzjins but I'll try to help
[07:36:47] <NodeX> what's the problem
[07:37:09] <edzjins> well, i've been trying to bind it to a DIV
[07:37:24] <edzjins> so that, whenever I scroll with my mouse scroller, something happens. no matter what.
[07:37:35] <edzjins> does the .scroll() work only for the whole document?
[07:38:10] <NodeX> it binds to anything
[07:38:27] <edzjins> ok.
[07:38:29] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/scroll/ <--- goto the demo
[07:38:33] <edzjins> yes, i see.
[07:38:40] <edzjins> there's an iframe, that's my doubt
[07:38:44] <edzjins> i tried with the basic
[07:39:05] <edzjins> $("selector").scroll(function(){ console.log("something"); });
[07:39:12] <edzjins> didn't output anything.
[07:39:13] <NodeX> $('#target').scroll(function() { ....
[07:39:17] <edzjins> yes yes
[07:39:28] <NodeX> perhaps it didnt find your selector
[07:39:51] <seutje> edzjins: can u make a test case that illustrates your issue, this makes it a lot easier to debug
[07:40:05] <edzjins> impossible. the selector is used just a few lines above, working.
[07:40:27] <clawfire> hello everybody
[07:40:30] <edzjins> i want to develop a zoom-in/zoom-out thing
[07:40:39] <edzjins> currently already working with buttons
[07:40:41] <clawfire> i got just a little question about html5 figure element support
[07:40:47] <edzjins> but want to attach the mouse wheel too.
[07:40:51] <clawfire> is it iterable ?
[07:42:28] <NodeX> edzjins : http://jsfiddle.net/ryRhK/1/
[07:42:37] <NodeX> works fine (and a mouse wheel)
[07:43:05] <mriecken> Hi all, does anyone have experience using dual select / cross select plug-ins for HTML form select/option elements?
[07:45:30] <edzjins> NodeX : yes, works fine. when you have something to scroll.. i need to catch an event where the user has entered the element with the mouse, and using the mouse wheel. then, according to how he has scrolled, i'll zoom my DIV in or out.
[07:47:41] <jita> Why doesn't this work?     if (a[8]) {       $('.omega h2').html('Station Hosted By: ' + a[8]);     };
[07:47:42] <Weedjo> sorry to ask again: I'm changing my url with "window.location.href ". After that I want to get access to the DOM. But my code is trying to access the code before the DOM is finished loading. How can I wait that long? I tried $(document).ready(function() but it seems that this works only once... is there really no way??
[07:48:26] <edzjins> ok, i guess there are too much questions, i'll just try to find a way :)
[07:48:26] <jita> It even executes if the a[8] is an empty string
[07:48:38] <edzjins> thanks to NodeX for at least trying
[07:49:04] <jita> How do i check if the variable is empty string ?
[07:49:45] <edzjins> if(a[8].length > 0){ .. }
[07:50:01] <NodeX> edzjins : not possible
[07:50:17] <NodeX> the scroll event is on the window recognising a scroll bar moving
[07:50:19] <negev> hi, im trying to use fancybox but nothing is happening. i have included the .css and .js files, and i'm grabbing some content via an ajax request and then calling: $.fancybox({'content': data});    but nothing happens and no errors are logged in the firebug console. what am i doing wrong?
[07:51:06] <edzjins> NodeX : ok, then i'll have to try this - http://plugins.jquery.com/project/mousewheel
[07:51:22] <solidus-river> guys
[07:51:26] <solidus-river> whats wrong wtih this code http://www.pastie.org/private/gcdxkf1yiyvphtlk7dkdw
[07:51:36] <solidus-river> i'm getting an issue with my call to .change()
[07:51:46] <solidus-river> it complains that the parameter has no method .split :?
[07:52:32] <NodeX> err poll_home is a string not a DOM object
[07:52:43] <NodeX> sorry
[07:52:50] <NodeX> forget that .. end of a long day
[07:53:14] <NodeX> console.log(poll_home_form); and see what it is
[07:53:16] <edzjins> NodeX , go get some sleep, you seem to try and answer all the questions in the same time
[07:53:37] <NodeX> can't got a bloody Harddrive running badblocks :(
[07:53:42] <solidus-river> NodeX: here, i was bieng thick, this is a pstie with the error http://www.pastie.org/2677327
[07:53:47] <NodeX> and I forgot to nohup it lol
[07:54:18] <NodeX> solidus-river : can you console.log() it
[07:54:41] <m4xx> anyone care to chime in? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7727909/call-to-plugin-method-using-proxy
[07:55:20] <solidus-river> NodeX: console.log returned a string thats the function i made..
[07:56:37] <NodeX> try to do this and see if it changes ... change(function(){ poll_home_form(); });
[07:57:52] <m4xx> Am i approaching it the wrong way? Should i just pass 'this' instead of trying to set the context?
[07:59:08] <solidus-river> NodeX nope, no it say Object blah blah has no method .split
[08:00:14] <NodeX> then it's not calling the function properly
[08:00:31] <NodeX> personaly I have never seen it done like that so I don't know if it would even work like thatg
[08:02:45] <airportyh> m4xx: it looks like you never called the proxied function
[08:03:11] <solidus-river> NodeX: what do you mean 'done like that'?
[08:03:37] <NodeX> the way you have setout the javascript with all the returns
[08:04:38] <solidus-river> NodeX: oh wow, i didn't even notice that, thats probably whats going on with it, lol
[08:04:43] <NodeX> lol
[08:05:05] <NodeX> I dunno if it's whats causing it because I don't write code like that so not sure :)
[08:07:39] <solidus-river> i'm using coffeescript for the first time and for some reason its putting those returns in there
[08:07:41] <solidus-river> lofely
[08:07:43] <solidus-river> *lovely
[08:07:54] <NodeX> duno what that is either lol
[08:08:06] * NodeX is a framework virgin
[08:08:35] <snover> lol
[08:08:35] <solidus-river> NodeX: well coffeescript is definitely something to check out if you use rails or node.js
[08:08:42] <m4xx> airtonix: Not sure if you're the one who answered on stack but thanks :) I now see the error in my ways
[08:08:50] <iEatChildren> why does console.log(jQuery.url.attr("protocol")); throw the error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'setUrl' of undefined" ?
[08:09:03] <solidus-river> http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/
[08:09:03] <NodeX> I dont use either .. infact the only 3rd party stuff I use ever is jquery 1.6
[08:09:12] <NodeX> rest of my stuff I write myself
[08:10:59] <NodeX> hmmz can;t work out whether to use tabs on a user' profile page to separate content from images and videos or not
[08:13:06] <jita> whats the shortcut for $('.omega h2').html(''); ???
[08:13:14] <jita> to empty the contents of h2
[08:13:14] <jita> ???
[08:13:22] <apfrod> .empty()
[08:13:41] <NodeX> empty() removes data and listners too
[08:14:30] <jita> it works thanks apfrod
[08:14:36] <jita> thanks NodeX
[08:14:39] <jita> too
[08:15:20] <NodeX> :)
[08:19:47] <khmer> hmm. looking in the source, .empty() runs cleanData on everything and then iterates through and removes
[08:20:16] <apfrod> so, a little heavy for the usage?
[08:20:20] <khmer> does it cause a memory leak to just remove the element and replace it, because you haven't removed the handlers?
[08:20:30] <khmer> apfrod: no, i'm sure the performance is fine
[08:20:49] <khmer> i'm just wondering about why it was done this way--i'm sure QA demonstrated that this was way better in IE
[08:21:39] <khmer> the cleanData call is necessary in order to clean up $.cache
[08:21:49] <khmer> it's the while loop that removes firstChild
[08:22:07] <khmer> why not cache the attributes, remove the element, and then append the element again and apply the attributes?
[08:22:12] <khmer> just a curiosity question really
[08:22:56] <mriecken> Hi all, does anyone have experience using dual select / cross select plug-ins for HTML form select/option elements?
[08:46:58] <jbrokc> there's a way to add a data-attribute such that you can .attr the methods if it's a jquery object. for instance, <div id="foo" data-bar-thing="something">whatever</div>   then $("#foo").barThing  // "something"   but that doesn'tn work, what's wrong?
[08:52:59] <khmer> jbrokc: it doesn't turn it into a method, it turns it into a data attribute
[08:53:13] <khmer> jbrokc: $('#foo').data('barThing')
[08:53:25] <jbrokc> oh, does it matter whether i use .data or .attr
[08:53:28] <khmer> jbrokc: in 1.6 and above, data-bar-thing turns into .data('barThing')
[08:53:28] <jbrokc> ohh, i see - nevermind
[08:54:11] <khmer> which conforms to W3C spec for JS properties made out of data attributes
[08:55:32] <bitwise_> is there a difference in using $.proxy(method, context) and method.call(context) ?
[08:55:50] <jbrokc> khmer: it's 1.6 and above?
[08:56:18] <khmer> bitwise_: $.proxy returns a new function which runs method.call(context)
[08:56:53] <khmer> jbrokc: in 1.4.3 and up, you can do $('#foo').data('bar-thing')
[08:57:07] <khmer> jbrokc: the difference in 1.6 is that it replaces the dashes with camel caps
[08:57:15] <jbrokc> khmer: alright - thanks. is that backwards compatible though?
[08:57:24] <jbrokc> that is, camel caps and dashes both work in 1.6+
[08:57:35] <khmer> haven't checked but i doubt it
[08:58:03] <bitwise_> thanks khmer
[08:59:14] <apfrod> I'm trying to do a find() on a page I've just loaded with $.post and something on the page is giving IE8 thousands of 'Object required' errors on line 1 char 1. Any clues?
[08:59:45] <khmer> apfrod: a fiddle would help
[08:59:47] <snax> I animation with jquery sufficient to re-write pacman with out flash ?
[08:59:58] <snax> 's/I/Is/'
[09:00:21] <PERECil_> snax: it is
[09:00:28] <ravenzz> yep
[09:01:01] <ravenzz> but I would suggest you to try with css3/html
[09:01:02] <ravenzz> 5
[09:01:36] <apfrod> khmer: i'm fishing for clues since it depends on the contents of the page I'm loading somehow. I might just pastebin the whole page
[09:02:14] <khmer> apfrod: try to isolate the problem before you expose your private content!
[09:03:29] <m4xx> are there any javascript or jquery functions to create something similar to an md5 hash?
[09:03:40] <iszak> m4xx, of course.
[09:04:00] <khmer> m4xx: have you googled this?
[09:04:20] <m4xx> i saw there is an md5 plugin
[09:04:25] <m4xx> but i don't really need an md5 hash
[09:05:06] <khmer> m4xx: help us out here, what do you actually need
[09:05:17] <juha_> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+md5
[09:05:33] <m4xx> i need a unique identifier generated from a string and date
[09:06:11] <m4xx> juha_: (12:04:20 PM) m4xx: i saw there is an md5 plugin
[09:06:32] <khmer> m4xx: what about md5 does not satisfy this?
[09:06:39] <m4xx> it seems too heavy
[09:06:49] <khmer> m4xx: as in hex_md5(str + new Date().getTime())
[09:07:21] <khmer> then why hash it at all?
[09:14:01] <t4nkd> Hey jquery; is there a better/faster way of saying $('element').parent().parent() if I need the parent of 'element's parent?
[09:15:02] <context> .closest('..') ? which is prolly just as fast
[09:15:09] <t4nkd> ah okay cool
[09:15:10] <context> or... just id/class the parent.parent to begin with ?
[09:15:26] <context> stop hunting for random crap
[09:15:32] <t4nkd> I can .parent('class') ?
[09:16:43] <t4nkd> oh it looks like I can, cool deal
[09:19:44] <energee> id like to make a parent item open a nested div upon hover, however i have seravl of these items on the page.. how do i target that particular item rather html item that has that  particular class?
[09:20:09] <energee> rattan every html item*
[09:20:27] <energee> sorry, rather than every html item*
[09:39:20] <objNoob|> Hi, trying to make a section like accordion but with a single section.
[09:39:54] <objNoob|> any idears?
[09:42:10] <dogarrhea2> is .draggable turning your elements into position: relative as far as css goes a normal behavior?
[09:42:12] <d3vic3> objNoob|: use a sliding div http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[09:42:35] <objNoob|> I dont even need it to slide
[09:42:46] <objNoob|> I just want it like a div with a title section
[09:42:54] <objNoob|> but with nice rounded borders
[09:43:16] <objNoob|> and a the title section the same theme
[09:43:34] <d3vic3> objNoob|: that's a CSS question not jquery one
[09:43:46] <gnarf> objNoob|: you can use the ui css framework
[09:43:57] <gnarf> objNoob|: just look at the generated html of the accordion
[09:44:03] <d3vic3> dogarrhea2: that's needed to get dragging right
[09:44:13] <objNoob|> gnarf, thanks
[09:44:14] <gnarf> its prolly like an <h2 class="ui-widget-title"> or somesuch
[09:44:48] <objNoob|> gnarf, looking into it now
[09:44:57] <dogarrhea2> d3vic3, i can later set the position to absolute and it still drags.
[09:45:10] <gnarf> dogarrhea2: if the position is static, it needs to change
[09:45:17] <gnarf> but otherwise i think it keeps whatever you have
[09:45:29] <gnarf> tbh - haven't looked much at draggable yet
[09:55:11] <d3vic3> dogarrhea2: jquery is modifying it everytime you drag
[09:58:55] <swiggy> Can someone help me here ---> http://jsfiddle.net/ksauls/H4gtT/1/ <-------- I am trying to create a form validation for the 'emails' part of the form, and it works fine now, if all the textboxes are empty.. but if the FIRST textbox is not null/empty - the form submits even if the others after the first are empty
[09:59:15] <swiggy> and it should check to make sure ALL the email textboxes (class emailtext) are not empty
[09:59:31] <swiggy> the form validation is the first peice of code inside the javascript box
[09:59:41] <swiggy> to add email textboxes, click the plus sign
[10:00:07] <Aristata> Hey guys, I am using jquery autocomplete in my app. In some cases there will be a page where the same auto complete needs to happen on two different forms. I am basically doing $(input.school-search).autocomplete(blahblah) Now the first input with the autocomplete in the dom always works, but the second does not. If I remove the first then the second does. Anyone know how to solve this?
[10:01:39] <goog`> anyone heard about http://www.kendoui.com ?
[10:02:31] <goog`> list kendoui
[10:02:36] <Aristata> Opp nm, I needed an each function
[10:03:44] <swiggy> how can i break out of an .each()
[10:04:41] <swiggy> wow goog` kendoi is pure sexy
[10:05:45] <timmywil> swiggy: return false
[10:05:49] <swiggy> totally going to start using this
[10:06:02] <ajpiano> goog`: i've heard of it - they sponsored jqcon :)
[10:06:06] <ajpiano> but i haven't used it
[10:06:51] <energee> if i'd like to create popups on dynamic content, does each element need to have separate class or can they all share a particular class and target a nested child element for popup text?
[10:07:31] <swiggy> this is so sexy and so much faster than jquery ui
[10:12:25] <rroelofs> swiggy: sadly all I got when I tried autocomplete is "Aww Snap!"
[10:12:36] <swiggy> ?
[10:12:44] <swiggy> there is a list of example words to use
[10:12:48] <rroelofs> chrome page crash
[10:22:59] <Vilkku> hello all, I got a script which has a couple of sections like this: http://pastebin.com/BhDAtKsp as you can see, I'm typing out the circleMenuName two times for each part like that, and I think that there must be a way of not having to do that at all, but instead use the name from the first line
[10:23:33] <Vilkku> however, I cannot simply use $(this) as there are two elements that have the same class, and I want both to change
[10:23:46] <goog`> anyoone heared about http://www.kendoui.com/
[10:23:47] <goog`> ?
[10:24:00] <Vilkku> so what I searched for was some way to interpret $(this) as a string instead of an object, but I had no luck so far
[10:24:50] <objNoob|> Im trying to use this to return the text of the second (index 1) cell  http://pastebin.com/AP75ZDms
[10:24:53] <objNoob|> But its not working
[10:25:03] <objNoob|> I've tried different combinations of the selector
[10:28:57] <eric_lewis> has anyone had an issue with galleria where it loads fine on first load of a page, but not on refresh?
[10:29:08] <eric_lewis> or any ideas why it would do that?
[10:40:27] <monk12> hello all, i am running into a 'Stop running this script' popup in IE8. not sure what is causing it in my jquery code. is there a nice program to easily see issues/leaks?
[10:41:03] <yedimind> monk12, http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[10:41:12] <yedimind> required reading
[10:41:30] <monk12> k i'll take a look.
[10:44:13] <Cade> How would you go about using jquery to make an image fade in from right to left?
[10:44:43] <context> animate ?
[10:45:04] <MaC> I'm kind of new to query. I need to grab the first element of a list of anchors and use it to set the background of another div on page load
[10:45:05] <MaC> jQuery('#wrap').css('background-image', 'url(' ')'); is what I've got now, I'm missing the selector, not sure what it should be
[10:45:06] <s34n> what is the return value for ui widgets like dialog()?
[10:46:37] <s34n> MaC: that is using a selector, and setting the image
[10:46:38] <Cade> Ok, but how would I use animate? I've done a few things in JQuery, but just basic stuff.
[10:47:45] <s34n> MaC: what do you mean by ~"use the first element"?
[10:48:06] <s34n> use it how?
[10:48:18] <MaC> I have a list of anchors that link to images, on hover those images change the background of this #wrap div
[10:48:48] <MaC> but by default I need the first of the <a>'s to do the bg
[10:50:29] <eric_lewis> my jquery galleria loads fine on first load, but not on page refresh. any idea why anybody?
[10:50:51] <MaC> 1 sec s34n
[10:51:09] <daveluke> how do i check if a dom element exists?
[10:51:18] <daveluke> i thought it was simply if ('#poop') { }
[10:51:51] <objNoob|> #poop in your anal cav maybe lolz
[10:52:34] <Aristata> $('selector').length > 0
[10:52:34] <s34n> daveluke: missing a $?
[10:52:49] <daveluke> oh yeah
[10:53:36] <daveluke> apparently you have to do .get(0)
[10:53:39] <daveluke> works
[10:54:19] <s34n> MaC: so you have some list of <a> elements that are somehow differentiated from all other <a> elements and you want to grab the first in document order?
[10:54:23] <bjornbjorn> anyone here have experience with zepto.js?
[10:54:37] <s34n> MaC: how are the differentiated?
[10:54:53] <MaC> s34m yah I want the first in the document so I can grab the href, just in order in a slideshow div
[10:55:08] <MaC> so #slideshow div: first child kind of thing
[10:57:58] <s34n> MaC: $("#slideshow > a").attr("href")
[10:58:02] <Faerris> Hey folks, trying to figure out how to stop my tabs from causing the page to "jump" up when switching. I've found code to set heights for the tab boxes but I'm not sure where to put them.
[10:58:26] <zoned> where can i find a list of event keycodes?
[10:58:40] <zoned> (event.which for keypress)
[10:59:09] <pootpoot> http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=where+can+i+find+a+list+of+event+keycodes
[10:59:16] <pootpoot> :P
[10:59:55] <zoned> pootpoot, i thought jquery had it's own 'normalized' list? no?
[11:00:44] <initself> a while back, someone created an alternative to JSLint.
[11:00:50] <initself> Anyone remember what it was called?
[11:00:51] <pootpoot> oh maybe. im not sure, i handle keyboard inputs with regular keyCodes
[11:01:04] <initself> JSHint
[11:01:17] <kborchers> pootpoot: here is what jQuery UI uses https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.core.js#L23
[11:02:33] <pootpoot> ah interesting
[11:04:10] <zoned> pootpoot, i thought there were some differences between browsers, so jquery had its own list. i couldn't find it though, so maybe i'm wrong about that.
[11:05:02] <MaC> s34n 	var href_a = jQuery("#slideshow-wrap a:first").attr("href");
[11:05:04] <MaC> that was it
[11:06:47] <s34n> MaC: you don't really need the ":first"
[11:07:27] <s34n> MaC: .attr() will act on the first element on the list of matches
[11:07:31] <MaC> oh, thanks
[11:10:37] <mriecken> Hi all, does anyone have experience using dual select / cross select plug-ins for HTML form select/option elements?
[11:11:52] <Kevin2332> Hey is anyone here, I need some help
[11:13:22] <Cade> Is it possible to have a transparency fade move across an image? Like a moving transparency gradient?
[11:14:10] <Kevin2332> I don't think anyone is here
[11:14:22] <Kevin2332> I don't know the answer to that Cade
[11:16:33] <monk12> good tutorial yedimind, knew most of it though :). Just looking for a way to debug memory issues specificially in IE which Fiddler won't do.
[11:17:30] <monk12> let me check if the IE Debugger has somethin'. forgot to check deeply there
[11:18:03] <monk12> maybe the Profiler. i shall report back in 10m
[11:20:27] <clarencenhuang> on the jquery docs it talks about being able to animate custom properties using the "animate()" function but it doesn't actually work when i try it =(
[11:20:42] <clarencenhuang> i'm using a custom property set using the .data()
[11:21:16] <monk12> Profiler looks good enough to debug what functions most time being spent on. thanks.
[11:21:17] <japherwocky> you should try pastebinning some actual code if you want help
[11:25:25] <clarencenhuang> japherwocky: thanks for the advice
[11:25:28] <clarencenhuang> here it is: http://pastie.org/2678418
[11:26:30] <chovy> i'm using $.get()
[11:26:46] <chovy> how do i specify a beforeSend function?
[11:27:13] <gnarf> chovy: you use $.ajax() ?
[11:27:24] <gnarf> chovy: $.get() is just an alias for $.ajax
[11:27:38] <gnarf> if you need more options than the convinent alias provides, use $.ajax
[11:28:11] <chovy> gnarf: there's no way to chain it? like you can with $.get().complete().error().success() ?
[11:28:20] <keiron> hello room. Can I set a timeout for $.load()?
[11:28:24] <gnarf> chovy: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L268-285
[11:28:37] <gnarf> chovy: you can't add a "beforeSend" after the function
[11:28:56] <gnarf> chovy: after $.ajax() is called - its already "sent"
[11:29:08] <chovy> gnarf: ok
[11:29:29] <gnarf> just use $.ajax({ type: "get", url: url, ....
[11:29:57] <chovy> gnarf: thanks
[11:29:59] <chovy> wi;l do
[11:31:49] <keiron> hello room
[11:34:02] <keiron> I am loading an image on the fly using $('<img/>').attr('src', image_url).load(function() { - i have noticed some images take ages to load. is there a way to tell it to timeout?
[11:34:19] <keiron> i have used $.ajaxSetup to set timeout but that doesn't seem to have any effect on $.load
[11:36:05] <dabear> keiron: why would it?
[11:36:35] <keiron> dabear: why not?
[11:36:42] <dabear> keiron: simply removeAttr("src") on the img cancels any loading
[11:36:53] <dabear> keiron: because of the name
[11:37:03] <dabear> $.ajaxSetup
[11:37:16] <keiron> oh yeah :)
[11:37:20] <dabear> why would you think that is related to the browser downloading an image?
[11:37:34] <Cade> Is it even possible to have a transparency gradient move across a picture?
[11:38:05] <keiron> dabear: good point. however, there is still a timeout issue with loading an image this way - any way to set a timeout?
[11:38:29] <dabear> keiron: yes, and I gave you the solution above
[11:38:48] <keiron> dabear: removeAttr("src")  ?
[11:38:57] <dabear> ?mdc settimeout @ keiron
[11:38:59] <bot-t> keiron, window.setTimeout - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/window.setTimeout
[11:39:14] <dabear> should work if you combine with settimeout
[11:40:27] <mriecken> Hi all, does anyone have experience using dual select / cross select plug-ins for HTML form select/option elements?
[11:40:27] <keiron> dabear: aah I see what you mean, thank you
[11:41:39] <^zoggy^> linked select/combo boxes?
[11:42:33] <mriecken> ^zoggy^: yes, two boxes with the ability to move selected objects to the right, and unselected to the left
[11:43:11] <^zoggy^> oh, there are tons of tutorials out there for that
[11:43:19] <^zoggy^> jquery ui has a thing to do that as well
[11:43:40] <mriecken> I've got the plug-in working.. but I can't seem to get the elements to post along with my other form elements
[11:44:04] <mriecken> here's a link to the one I'm looking at: http://hackerhosting.com/ph-jquery/www/demo/dualselect.html
[11:44:46] <mriecken> it reads my select/options and displays fine, but it converts my 'select' tags to 'ul' tags, and my 'option' tags to 'li' tags.. which aren't being picked up in the form submission
[11:45:14] <airstrike> hello
[11:45:41] <amid_hasan> how to I pull data from a json file where a certain criteria matches, using jquery?
[11:48:11] <azendal> hi there anyone who know the internals of Event.prototype.stopPropagation
[11:48:21] <context> amid_hasan: map reduce?
[11:48:32] <azendal> jQuery.Event.prototype.stopPropagation()
[11:48:33] <context> you write code that looks at the data and gives you what you want ?
[11:48:43] <amid_hasan> context: what is map reduce?
[11:48:51] <context> ... google knows
[11:49:07] <amid_hasan> google knows EVERYTHING about EVERYONE
[11:50:03] <webdev5> how do you get the class of the currently focused object?
[11:50:38] <keiron> dabear: mind if I PM you?
[11:51:03] <context> well seeing as elements can have more than one class the question is already a trick
[11:51:04] <dabear> plz figure it out your self
[11:51:11] <dabear> rather than pm
[11:51:21] <dabear> or ask here
[11:51:39] <context> keiron: there is no reason to move questions to PM when you are more likely to get an anwer when you ask a room full of people
[11:51:56] <dabear> ?nopm
[11:51:57] <bot-t> Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[11:51:57] <azendal> hi there anyone who know the internals of jQuery.Event.prototype.stopPropagation
[11:52:12] <context> azendal: you asked that 2 minutes ago.
[11:52:17] <keiron> ok :)
[11:52:29] <context> azendal: jquery source code is open source. you can look up jquery's implementation on your own
[11:52:58] <azendal> i want to know why it is preventing propagation when its supposed to only preventDefault
[11:53:00] <webdev5> here is my attempt http://jsfiddle.net/Y4ur6/1/
[11:53:23] <kborchers> azendal: wat?
[11:53:27] <context> what
[11:53:36] <kborchers> you want to know why stopPropagation stops propagation?
[11:53:38] <context> azendal: no the docs say 'stop event from bubbling' ...
[11:53:51] <context> 'preventing ANY parent handlers ....'
[11:53:53] <devinrolsen> did you know, that google has limited the amount of pins you can drop into gmaps in a single second? "There are limits on the number of geocoding requests per day and the rate of geocoding requests per second that Google will service from a single IP address."
[11:54:03] <devinrolsen> no wonder half our clients pins never show up.
[11:54:06] <azendal> sorry preventDefault is stopping propagation
[11:54:19] <PrgmrBill> devinrolsen: source?
[11:54:20] <azendal> not following w3c DOM 3 events
[11:54:37] <kborchers> ?demo @ azendal
[11:54:38] <bot-t> azendal, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:55:36] <devinrolsen> PrgmrBill, found this on a stackoverflow, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6425752/google-maps-api-v3-usage-limits-is-per-website-visitor-or-per-web-server
[11:55:39] <webdev5> http://jsfiddle.net/Y4ur6/1/  How do you get the class of the currently focused element?
[11:55:46] <devinrolsen> guys says he found it here http://code.google.com/intl/it/apis/maps/faq.html
[11:56:30] <context> webdev5: you asked that two minutes ago. and elements dont have "A class" they have MANY classES.
[11:56:58] <PrgmrBill> thanks
[11:57:13] <webdev5> ok with my example, if I want to know if the div or ojbect has focus
[11:57:14] <devinrolsen> PrgmrBill, confirmed. Simple setTimeout of 500*i now (although slowly) drops all the pins on the map.
[11:57:17] <webdev5> how would I do htat?
[11:57:24] <webdev5> *that
[11:57:42] <kborchers> ?:focus @ webdev5
[11:57:42] <bot-t> webdev5, http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-dev/browse_thread/thread/67ede2e034ab62f3/def5b2207b99a731
[11:57:46] <kborchers> damn it
[11:57:59] <kborchers> http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[11:58:06] <ale_> Hello, I have a form with inputs and a file to upload, how can I integrate both of them and when the form is submitted, the file and the inputs are sent to a php?
[11:58:23] <amid_hasan> how do i loop through json where theres a match in one of the key value pairs?
[11:58:27] <context> wow!
[11:58:33] <webdev5> I'll try that thanks kborchers
[11:58:35] <context> $('*').live is the most horrid thing ive ever seen
[11:58:42] <devinrolsen> :O
[11:58:45] <kborchers> was just thinking the same thing!
[11:58:46] <devinrolsen> yeah, dont do that.
[11:58:56] <yedimind> wow that is awesome
[11:58:58] <webdev5> sorry context
[11:59:06] <webdev5> it's straight from jquery.com
[11:59:10] <azendal> http://jsfiddle.net/azendal/d9T4Q/ you will se that click still gets handled so further events don't matter
[11:59:11] <kborchers> where?
[11:59:12] <context> put sugar in your gas tank while your at it. excellent for engine performance.
[11:59:20] <devinrolsen> haha
[11:59:22] <yedimind> $('*').live('hover', cornify() )
[11:59:51] <context> :/
[12:00:03] <context> wel alright. maybe live() handles '*' in a special manner
[12:00:19] <azendal> my mistake
[12:00:25] <ale_> Anyone guys? It's just an ajax upload with common inputs, but I am getting crazy with it!
[12:01:01] <kborchers> context: no really, where did you see $('*').live on jquery.com so we can kill it (though i doubt you saw it there)
[12:01:37] <context> kborchers: i didn't webdev5 did
[12:01:54] <kborchers> sorry, just so scarred by what i saw
[12:02:05] <webdev5> I'll paste you the link
[12:02:07] <webdev5> one moment
[12:02:23] <jaequery> what do you guys prefer,   2 space tabs,  or 4 space tabs?
[12:02:28] <context> kborchers: IL. from the quad cities myself.
[12:02:48] <keiron> dabear: I did what you suggested, but the problem is I need to know when it times out
[12:02:57] <webdev5> http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[12:03:15] <keiron> dabear: removing src doesn't seem to make the $.load call call .error
[12:04:03] <webdev5> I'll ask the broader question then
[12:04:05] <webdev5> http://lds.org/general-conference/watch/2011/10?lang=eng&vid=1194601588001
[12:04:08] <webdev5> click on that link
[12:04:13] <webdev5> start tabbing through the page
[12:04:13] <dabear> keiron: then .trigger("error")
[12:04:19] <webdev5> this is for blind people
[12:04:29] <webdev5> when you tab inside the video object
[12:04:30] <kborchers> webdev5: wow, i will get on killing that now. thanks
[12:04:39] <webdev5> the tab gets trapped
[12:04:52] <webdev5> you're welcome kborchers
[12:05:29] <webdev5> you work with the jquery site kborchers?
[12:05:48] <ale_> please anyone?!
[12:05:50] <Cade> Can someone point me to a script that will take an image or div with a background image and cut it into slices that can be affected individually?
[12:05:57] <kborchers> i am a contributor on UI
[12:06:04] <webdev5> oh ok good deal
[12:06:42] <webdev5> cade, what about map?
[12:07:43] <Cade> map?
[12:08:06] <davidthedrake> With a select element, what's the best way to grab the text within the <option></option> if the value is known?
[12:08:21] <webdev5> cade: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_usemap.asp
[12:08:48] <keiron> dabear: is this the use of settimeout you expected?: http://pastebin.com/PhtwaMVM
[12:08:52] <Cade> I thought you mean this map http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[12:08:55] <context> kborchers: it does appear jquery is intelligent about $('*').live
[12:09:21] <Cade> I want to affect their transparency
[12:09:40] <Cade> I'm trying to make a transparency gradient
[12:09:40] <webdev5> cade: create an example somewhere
[12:09:43] <cmcnulty> ey all, Is there a jquery style guideline for the order of function declarations?  for instance, public before private, alphabetical? etc?
[12:10:04] <context> cade: fadeIn() ?
[12:10:17] <Cade> That doesn't make a gradient, though.
[12:10:28] <Cade> It fade the whole thing at once
[12:10:48] <context> uhh why isnt it gradient before fading it in ?
[12:10:51] <phzbOx> I'm trying to use .position() to move an element on the right of another. Weirdly, it put it below it (and is hidden). However, if I do width() + offset().left, it wokks. Any idea why?
[12:10:55] <webdev5> anyone have a solution to my problem?
[12:10:59] <context> just make whatever gradient to begin with....
[12:11:03] <dabear> keiron: sorta. I hope you don't have that kinda code in a loop
[12:11:09] <context> gradient or not... you cant see it
[12:11:13] <Cade> Because I want the gradient to move across the image to fade it in.
[12:11:19] <context> then you just have to do fade in, not fade in AND gradient
[12:11:19] <keiron> dabear: i have it in a loop
[12:11:20] <webdev5> tab getting trapped in a video object
[12:11:26] <context> oh.
[12:11:56] <dabear> keiron: then it wouldn't work. element inside setTimeout will always point to the last value of "element" (e.g. the last iteration)
[12:12:02] <keiron> dabear: where would you recommend i use .trigger('error') here?
[12:12:20] <keiron> dabear: i know, i used a cache array but simplified it for the example
[12:13:05] <dabear> keiron: right after you removed the attribute?
[12:13:14] <ale_> anyone knows how to use http://jquery.malsup.com/form ?

[12:13:38] <keiron> dabear: i guess it means .error will be called for every image, whether it errored or not
[12:14:01] <keiron> dabear: i think i could work around this
[12:14:27] <keiron> thanks for your help
[12:15:22] <dabear> keiron: you can check an images .complete property
[12:15:38] <dabear> and only remove src if it is not complete
[12:15:39] <dabear> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_img_complete.asp
[12:15:55] <dabear> and also only trigger when that happens too
[12:16:05] <keiron> dabear: brilliant thanks
[12:16:34] <keiron> dabear: does $(element).complete() return true / false?
[12:16:46] <dabear> keiron: no
[12:16:50] <dabear> it is a dom property
[12:16:57] <dabear> not a jquery method
[12:17:06] <dabear> look at the example there..
[12:17:16] <amh345> afternoon.   is there a way to have jquery interact with a mov/avi?  i want to pop text up during certain video keyframes.  desperately trying to avoid flash
[12:17:32] <keiron> aah
[12:17:39] <keiron> ok i'll have a go
[12:17:44] <keiron> thanks very much for your help
[12:17:57] <keiron> gotta head off now, bye!

[12:26:02] <webdev5> anyone on tabbing and getting stuck in a video object?
[12:26:38] <mbtez> if i have a SELECT/OPTION list
[12:26:47] <mbtez> how do i monitor it to call a function whenever it's changed
[12:26:49] <interopcop> is it difficult to port java script to jquery?  i.e. I have a recipe for a page which includes about 50 lines of javascript (perhaps prototype, but I can't really tell if it's using prototype) - I am trying to run it in an environment with jquery 1.6.4, but it's not working.
[12:28:05] <interopcop> in firebug I can see the error "Uncaught Syntax Error: unexpected )"
[12:28:21] <crest_> Hey guys!
[12:28:21] <interopcop> but in the line it's pointing at, the curly brackets are perfectly balanced
[12:28:32] <dabear> interopcop: jquery IS javascript
[12:28:36] <interopcop> I know
[12:28:41] <crest_> I have a question: how would i define a function in jquery?
[12:28:46] <interopcop> so does that mean it ought to work?
[12:28:52] <dabear> mm
[12:28:56] <dabear> yeah
[12:28:59] <interopcop> I guess that could mean it requires prototype
[12:29:18] <webdev5> crest function() {}
[12:29:37] <dabear> syntax errors means you did something wrong in copy and pasting
[12:29:46] <crest_> here is some code here, tell me what is wrong with it.
[12:29:51] <interopcop> ok I'll double check
[12:29:53] <crest_> http://pastebin.com/SPnWAWFW
[12:30:35] <crest_> i know the code works, except for the function definition.
[12:31:07] <crest_> I call that file in the header, right, and then I want ot be able to call that function in one of my web pages.
[12:31:09] <here4thegear> I'm confused... when I use $.ajax and post {"date": "2012-02-04"} to a php page shouldn't I be able to access that via $_POST["date"]?
[12:31:37] <yedimind> you dont post the json object, you post a serialized array
[12:32:10] <crest_> comments? is that how I define a jquery function?
[12:32:47] <here4thegear> yedimind: so how do I convert that into one?
[12:33:51] <amh345>  is there a way to have jquery interact with a mov/avi?  i want to pop text up during certain video keyframes.  desperately trying to avoid flash
[12:34:30] <ravenzz> amh345 http://popcornjs.org/
[12:34:39] <ale_> Does someone know how to make a damn form with file inputs  and common inputs with ajax?
[12:35:03] <amh345> beaut. thanks ravenzz. am i to understand that this cant be done not using html5?
[12:35:16] <ravenzz> yep
[12:35:44] <ale_> please someone?
[12:35:52] <amh345> gotcha, thanks again ravenzz
[12:35:57] <ravenzz> that it can be done in html6
[12:36:00] <ravenzz> 5
[12:36:01] <ravenzz> sorry
[12:36:12] <ravenzz> otherwhise you can take a look at
[12:36:16] <kborchers> webdev5: http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/ ;)
[12:36:33] <ravenzz> jw flv player...it has nice js api
[12:37:05] <ale_> ravenzz: do you know?
[12:37:06] <amh345> that doesnt require flash?
[12:37:30] <loincloth> hey all
[12:37:31] <ravenzz> that requires flash
[12:37:36] <amh345> word/
[12:37:36] <loincloth> anybody use Jasmine for testing?
[12:37:58] <ale_> ravenzz: how can I do it then?
[12:38:02] <ravenzz> ale_ I haven't do that before
[12:38:06] <loincloth> or know a good place on freenode for Jasmine help?
[12:38:57] <ale_> anyone ?
[12:39:41] <ravenzz> amh345 basically you can do that with the jw flv player, it can spawn an html5 video player instead of the flash one
[12:40:22] <ravenzz> if the browser isn't html5 compliant it will use the flash one
[12:41:44] <amh345> so there is no way to play a video in a player with span overlays using straightup html?
[12:42:14] <ravenzz> yes
[12:42:44] <ravenzz> let's say that you push play on the jw..you can trigger that event
[12:43:07] <ravenzz> in js and show the text or do something else
[12:43:28] <ravenzz> the same when you click pause or stop or any other event
[12:43:45] <BlaDe^> what's the correct way to do this: 	$('#dragOverlay input[name=file[]]')
[12:43:48] <ravenzz> I suck in english so It is hard to me to explain that
[12:44:11] <cypha> how difficult would it be to hook jquery-templates into my framework to use as its templating language?
[12:44:45] <ravenzz> amh345 http://goo.gl/3jcXc
[12:46:18] <loincloth> BlaDe^: might need to quote the name
[12:46:23] <loincloth> name='file[]'
[12:46:43] <BlaDe^> ok should i do $(".... name='file[]'") then ?
[12:46:49] <BlaDe^> or esape the quotes?
[12:47:02] <loincloth> i would say the former
[12:47:09] <ravenzz> amh345 http://www.longtailvideo.com/addons/?q=subtitles
[12:47:09] <BlaDe^> okay thanks i'll try it
[12:47:10] <loincloth> as i dislike escaped characters in code
[12:47:15] <loincloth> but whatever works
[12:47:29] <amh345> the thing im not 100% on is jw player requires html5 or it degrade html5 to standard html?
[12:47:35] <amh345> ravenzz: ^
[12:48:08] <ravenzz> it works both in html5 mode and flash
[12:48:12] <ravenzz> automatically
[12:48:30] <ravenzz> depending on the browser
[12:48:52] <ravenzz> and the video type of course
[12:49:13] <ravenzz> (eg. the html5 player can't play flv videos)
[12:51:33] <webdev5> anyone take bribes?
[12:53:11] <yedimind> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi_AAqi0RZM ahahaha brogramming primer
[12:53:33] <webdev5> that was a quick turnaround kborchers
[12:53:51] <kborchers> we don't mess around :)
[12:53:55] <yedimind> webdev5, brides for what
[12:53:58] <yedimind> err bribes
[12:54:14] <webdev5> bribes to help me.
[12:54:30] <webdev5> I'm trying to help blind people out
[12:54:33] <webdev5> it's a worthy cause
[12:54:42] <webdev5> http://lds.org/general-conference/watch/2011/10?lang=eng&vid=1194601588001
[12:54:46] <webdev5> go to that site
[12:54:50] <webdev5> tab to the video
[12:54:58] <webdev5> the tab gets stuck in the video object
[12:55:18] <Cade> I am fairly new to jquery. Can someone explain how to create new elements with .add()? Because this http://api.jquery.com/add/ isn't doing it.
[12:55:40] <webdev5> I was considering using javascript/jquery to detect when it is within the object
[12:56:25] <yedimind> jesus christ how many bible thumpings sites are needed on the interweb
[12:56:35] <yedimind> sadly 90% of them have better design direction than most of the rest of the web lately
[12:56:44] <webdev5> try to overlook the content
[12:56:48] <webdev5> if you need
[12:56:55] <webdev5> and focus on the issue
[12:57:00] <ravenzz> It's the Jersey Shore night
[12:57:24] <ravenzz> in Italy
[12:57:40] <ravenzz> the bible commit suicide
[12:59:06] <webdev5> by the power of grizzly bears everywhere, I call upon the aid of DABEAR!
[13:01:29] <snover> um. mormons? website? wut?
[13:01:43] <webdev5> ahh a response, thank you snover
[13:01:54] <webdev5> ok so hit the tab key on that site
[13:01:56] <snover> oh, sorry, you think Iโm going to help you
[13:01:58] <snover> Iโm not
[13:01:59] <snover> at all
[13:02:06] <webdev5> ha ok
[13:02:15] <snover> I mean, unless you need to be saved from jesus
[13:07:40] <webdev5> uhh no
[13:07:40] <yedimind> oh geez, i was just poking fun earlier, but its not like it's HIS website
[13:07:40] <yedimind> he's just doing it for money, just like anyone else
[13:07:40] <yedimind> webdev5, whats the problem exactly with the video ?
[13:07:40] <webdev5> thank you yedi
[13:07:40] <webdev5> so if you tab to the video
[13:07:41] <webdev5> the focus gets stuck in the video
[13:07:41] <snover> yedimind: โhe only killed those people for the money, he didnโt want to kill the peopleโ
[13:07:41] <snover> BUT THE MONEY!
[13:07:41] <webdev5> it's a common problem
[13:07:41] <yedimind> webdev5, thats a flash thing, you wont be able to get out of that
[13:07:41] <webdev5> snover, I would kill you for free
[13:07:41] <webdev5> :)
[13:07:41] <webdev5> its a common flash problem
[13:07:41] <webdev5> I guess the tab focus gets stuck in an endless loop
[13:07:42] <webdev5> I was trying to detect via javascript when it gets stuck in the object
[13:07:42] <yedimind> its not an endless loop, its just taht flash hijacks the focus and doesnt let it go
[13:07:42] <yedimind> the same reason you cant ctrl+w a tab when you're watching porn
[13:07:42] <webdev5> ahh ok
[13:07:42] <yedimind> because flash hijacked the focus state
[13:07:42] <snover> hijacked, asked and received from the browserโฆpotato, potato
[13:07:42] <webdev5> ahh
[13:07:43] <webdev5> any ideas how to steal it back with javascript?
[13:07:43] <yedimind> im pretty sure youd have to do something iwthin the flash to let it back out
[13:07:43] <bitwise_> can i .bind() to just a normal object?
[13:07:43] <yedimind> as opposed to a socially awkward object?
[13:07:43] <bitwise_> i seem to be able to trigger from it
[13:07:43] <webdev5> the video object has a class, couldn't I detect when that class has focus?
[13:07:51] <snover> webdev5: maybe if you pray really hard
[13:07:57] <yedimind> webdev5, youre missing the point, there's nothing in your DOM tree that is doing it, it's the flash object itself
[13:08:06] <bitwise_> yedimind: nice
[13:08:13] <snover> yedimind: but maybe there can be a miracle
[13:08:17] <snover> a miracle!
[13:08:24] <yedimind> if jebus wills it, it shall be so
[13:08:27] <bitwise_> its an object with seasonal affective disorder
[13:08:28] <yedimind> PART THE DOM SEAS
[13:08:29] <webdev5> ok I'll try to pursue a solution from that angle
[13:08:39] <webdev5> but it's a proprietary app
[13:08:51] <webdev5> I understand the point you were making
[13:09:03] <webdev5> it's just that is more difficult to work with
[13:09:35] <webdev5> for whatever it's worth mocking Jesus, is a very bad idea
[13:09:50] <snover> because youโll kill me?
[13:09:53] <webdev5> nope
[13:10:12] <snover> because youโll wreck up the place?
[13:11:19] <webdev5> Matt. 12:36-37
[13:11:36] <snover> oh, because youโll *proselytize me*.
[13:11:45] <yedimind> that's the worst!
[13:11:48] <webdev5> anyway back to the issue
[13:11:57] <webdev5> thanks for your help yedi
[13:12:02] <yedimind> you shouldnt mock jesus because he's got feelings too, you know
[13:12:03] <Cade> Once I do .append("<div id=\"foo\">"); can I immediately reference it with $("foo")? or do I have to do anything else first?
[13:12:07] <yedimind> sorry haha
[13:12:23] <webdev5> it's ok, I'm not offended
[13:12:25] <yedimind> Cade, yes you can, though its $('#foo')
[13:12:28] <snover> webdev5: I am.
[13:12:31] <yedimind> not just foo unless you created <foo>
[13:13:23] <pifantastic> Cade, yes, but you'll need $('#foo') not $('foo')
[13:13:32] <yedimind> what did i just say ?
[13:13:45] <snover> the same thing only differently!
[13:14:05] <pifantastic> yedimind: I dont think you were very clear bro
[13:14:24] <Cade> Yeah. I just realized that's why it wasn't working
[13:14:32] <yedimind> i was brotally clear
[13:14:33] <cambrian> Doh! Another SlickGrid issue. Anyone ever use SlickGrid before?
[13:14:47] <yedimind> *grid* == garbage
[13:14:51] <interopcop> http://jsfiddle.net/Pc4aq/ adding new files is supposed to put them in an ul under the uplad button.  I can't figure out why it's not working.
[13:15:59] <scratcha> hi guys, im having an issue with the jquery slider. i have set a min and max value, however when i slide away from the min, and then back to the min, the value its reporting is not the min value ? if i grab the handle and move it slightly, eventually i'm able to obtain the min. has anyone had this issue or know how i might resolve it ?
[13:16:25] <pifantastic> interopcop: http://grimhappy.com/i/47375.png
[13:18:34] <pifantastic> interopcop: http://jsfiddle.net/k67rY/4/
[13:19:15] <pifantastic> you have several things wrong: calling MultiSelector before defining it, passing jQuery collection to addElement instead of a DOMElement, and using "foo" to select elements by ID with jQuery, instead of "#foo"
[13:22:07] <Laura_> How would I check the current page with jquery?
[13:22:19] <yedimind> check it for what? ticks?
[13:22:25] <Laura_> I want to do a check ex: if IE and "parent page" dont load the script
[13:22:54] <Laura_> a particular url would work too
[13:23:20] <Laura_> I just don't want a script loading in IE on this particular page because it slows down to ~40 seconds to load
[13:23:32] <here4thegear> okay so... .ajax with POST and this as data {date: "2012-01-21"} the server (php) is not picking up any $_POST['date'] earlier someone said serialize it but how?
[13:23:47] <yedimind> Laura_, http://www.javascriptkit.com/domref/documentproperties.shtml
[13:23:52] <sphinxxx> Laura_ : theres many ways to check browser
[13:23:59] <yedimind> you can also sniff IE specifically if thats all you want
[13:24:05] <Laura_> yeah I saw JQuery.broswer
[13:24:15] <Laura_> Specifically IE7
[13:24:26] <yedimind> so use that
[13:24:56] <yedimind> if ( !($.browser.msie && $.browser.version < 8.0)) { run your init here }
[13:25:01] <yedimind> or something along those lines
[13:25:18] <Laura_> thanks so much!
[13:26:29] <snover> yedimind: I hate you now.
[13:26:50] <snover> Laura_: browser sniffing is never the right way to do it.
[13:26:51] <snover> ever.
[13:27:02] <cambrian> I have a SlickGrid (think spreadsheet) that is populated with default data on $(document).ready. The SlickGrid has a onCellChange method that will use an ajax call to save any changes you make to the data in the grid. I also have an area to apply filters and return a filtered dataset. It triggers on form submit, posts the filter requirements, returns the filtered data, then uses the jQuery
[13:27:02] <cambrian> .replaceWith to replace the old grid with a new grid object. This is done within the scope of the button.click event, so when the function ends, the grid.onCellChange method is not being triggered anymore. Code: https://gist.github.com/feb704a94034c22aa68f  How can I update the SlickGrid object without replacing it, or how can I make the slick.onCellChange method availible once the button.click
[13:27:02] <cambrian> function has ended?
[13:27:15] <paul_irish> bot-t: tell imsky yo i got ISSUES with cssFX
[13:27:16] <bot-t> paul_irish, Okay.
[13:27:43] <context> if (browser ==IE) redirect('http://www.crashie.com');
[13:28:24] <Laura_> snover: It's a quick fix. My real problem is that an "addthis" javascript file is causing a real slowdown to load in IE
[13:29:29] <interopcop> pifantastic: thanks a lot!
[13:33:24] <yedimind> snover, sometimes a simple solution is just needed
[13:33:29] <yedimind> dont be so quick to hate
[13:35:02] <snover> the solution to not blocking page load is to 1. move where the script is on the page, 2. use the defer attribute, 3. fix the root cause. not browser sniffing. especially not browser sniffing using a deprecated function.
[13:35:19] <karega|aniasis> I know it is redundant to use prevent-default and stop-propagation at the beginning of a event handler and return false at the end but is it a good practice in case of js errors?
[13:36:06] <snover> karega|aniasis: if there was a javascript error, how would returning false help you in any way?
[13:36:27] <karega|aniasis> snover it wouldn't which is why I have the prevent default
[13:37:11] <snover> the best practice is to not write buggy code that throws unhandled errors
[13:37:12] <snover> :)
[13:37:54] <yedimind> the best approach is to just write buggy code to your heart's content
[13:38:08] <karega|aniasis> snover, of course
[13:38:20] <karega|aniasis> yedimind, you never got back to me.
[13:38:20] <gnarf> ?2bagsofdicks @snover
[13:38:21] <bot-t> snover, StoneCypher: miketaylr: don't talk to me. i'm busy eating two bags of dicks.
[13:38:24] <yedimind> about what
[13:38:34] <karega|aniasis> are you jedimind?
[13:38:35] * gnarf laughs
[13:38:40] <gnarf> good advice man
[13:38:46] <gnarf> return false is never a good idea tho
[13:38:49] <gnarf> for events
[13:38:50] <yedimind> yeah, but i have the short term memory of an african tick
[13:38:59] <gnarf> i always prefer doing preventDefault when i want to prevent the default
[13:39:04] <gnarf> and like stop prop when i want to stop prop
[13:39:19] <yedimind> preventdefault doesnt work with forms in every case ive tried
[13:39:21] <yedimind> which is frustrating
[13:39:29] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[13:39:33] <ProLoser|Work> i have me a qvetchin
[13:39:35] <gnarf> ?twss
[13:39:36] <bot-t> <iainvdw> was fiddling with it for a while, got close a few times, but didn't do exaclty what i wanted, thx!
[13:39:47] <karega|aniasis> yedimind, what do you mean in every case or in no case.
[13:41:57] <ProLoser|Work> i need some help with deferred and promise
[13:42:49] <ProLoser|Work> does anyone have examples of these methods being used?
[13:43:01] <yedimind> there's a promise method?
[13:43:07] <karega|aniasis> ProLoser|Work, why do you want promise?
[13:43:11] <karega|aniasis> what is your goal?
[13:43:16] <ProLoser|Work> i don't even know what promise is
[13:43:20] <ProLoser|Work> i don't know what any of them area
[13:43:21] <yedimind> $('girlfriend').promise(function() { var cheat = false; });
[13:43:32] <ProLoser|Work> hang on
[13:43:43] <ProLoser|Work> i am trying to implement 2 things
[13:44:01] <context> shouldn't that be $('female.girlfriend')
[13:44:22] <ProLoser|Work> vs what? male.girlfriend?
[13:44:37] <ProLoser|Work> anyway, lets say i have 2 ajax call wrappers
[13:44:55] <ProLoser|Work> i want to fire off callbacks when all of them completed
[13:44:56] <Columcille> ProLoser|Work: welcome to the 21st century.
[13:45:15] <context> well...
[13:45:33] <iEatChildren> whats the easiest way to determine if a url contains https or http? trying to write a script to test for https and run the desired functions if it is https
[13:45:55] <ProLoser|Work> it seems to me that deferred/promise can be used as a means to cache, couldn't it?
[13:45:59] <karega|aniasis> iEatChildren, use .protocol
[13:46:22] <context> ieatchildren: document.location.protocol
[13:46:27] <karega|aniasis> ProLoser|Work, I look at it as more for validating
[13:46:30] <context> just dont forget that it has a : at the end
[13:46:41] <context> it will be "http:" or "https:"
[13:46:42] <ProLoser|Work> like if i have 1 ajax request that could potentially be fired multiple times, i could just use deferred for caching and firing subsequent calls
[13:47:10] <karega|aniasis> yes but what about promise
[13:47:33] <ProLoser|Work> karega|aniasis: validating? my other scenario (aside from caching) is that I want to actually fire off several ajax calls, and when they are complete I want to execute the necessary code
[13:47:42] <context> well rule #1, females always lie. so $('girlfriend').promise() means nothing at all
[13:47:45] <context> :p
[13:47:56] <ProLoser|Work> i don't know what promise/deferred is exactly, i just have a vague understanding and was under the impression the 2 go together
[13:48:16] <ProLoser|Work> context: $('girlfriend').promise() === null
[13:48:26] <ProLoser|Work> or is it == false?
[13:48:42] <karega|aniasis> they do but are not exclusive
[13:48:54] <ProLoser|Work> you mean inclusive?
[13:49:05] <ProLoser|Work> nvm
[13:49:12] <ProLoser|Work> so what should i do to achieve the aforementioned results?
[13:49:26] <context> basically $('girlfriend').promise(..) your callback will never ever ever be called.
[13:49:42] <yedimind> there is no callback to begin with
[13:49:58] <ProLoser|Work> in all seriousness
[13:50:02] <context> srry
[13:53:55] <ProLoser|Work> $.ajax() is already compatible with .when(), how can i make my own methods compatible with it?
[13:54:20] <ProLoser|Work> by 'compatible' i mean .then() knows how and where to execute the callback, how can i achieve this in a homegrown function?
[13:59:42] <here4thegear> $.ajax not working as expected. I know it's U53R error but don't know what I'm doing wrong. The "echo" is empty string
[13:59:44] <here4thegear> http://pastebin.com/WML6EsXE
[14:01:03] <ProLoser|Work> man, it would be nice if you had some sort of error method in $.ajax wouldn't it
[14:01:54] <razzi> here4thegear, is there a specific reason for not usign the .post() shorthand?
[14:02:37] <chovy> $.get('ping.php') does not work in Chrome.
[14:02:53] <chovy> the error handler runs, not the success handler.
[14:03:02] <here4thegear> razzi: in this instance... no... in general I use $.ajax in case I want to change the method to get
[14:03:24] <Cade> When you fadeOut and element, the display gets set to "none". Is there a way to prevent that?
[14:05:49] <yedimind> Cade, animate the opacity manually instead
[14:06:09] <yedimind> "manually"
[14:06:21] <here4thegear> so why is it that I can't use the data I'm sending here http://pastebin.com/WML6EsXE ?
[14:07:21] <here4thegear> I've searched everywhere except for wherever the answer is
[14:08:46] <yedimind> what does the data object look like once the server returns it ?
[14:09:53] <here4thegear> yedimind: well, that's the problem... the server isn't (php) can't access the data sent by $.ajax in order to process it. there is nothing in $_POST
[14:10:26] <yedimind> because youre not passing anything to it
[14:10:37] <yedimind> you're only hitting dates.php with no params being passed
[14:10:55] <yedimind> i think
[14:11:02] <yedimind> sorry im not really fully paying attention
[14:11:35] <here4thegear> yedimind: data: '{date: "2012-01-21"}',
[14:12:40] <here4thegear> yedimind: it's all good... so, the above is what I'm passing as data. You were the one who told me earlier something about serializing? But, I don't know what that means or how to do it.
[14:15:53] <dogarrhea2_> i can use attr to set any arbitrary attribute I want right?
[14:16:29] <dogarrhea2_> something like $("#myDiv").attr("poopooAttribute", "hahahah"):?
[14:18:18] <here4thegear> dogarrhea2_: yeah
[14:18:58] <here4thegear> dogarrhea2_: although, I'd steer away from poopoo
[14:19:26] <dogarrhea2_> so that's the jquery way of doing this.someAttribute = "some value";
[14:19:34] <dogarrhea2_> for constructor objects
[14:21:53] <here4thegear> dogarrhea2_: pretty much
[14:23:04] <cypha> in jquery-tmpl, would it be possible to use my own templating languages variables within the <script> tags?
[14:26:00] <rroelofs> cypha:  it's just text.  You may have to play with your delimiter characters
[14:26:40] <rroelofs> but jquery-tmpl won't see anything until the back-end is done
[14:27:03] <rroelofs> you can even modify the template in js before passing it on to tmpl
[14:27:14] <cypha> rroelofs, kk, I ask you about that
[14:27:24] <cypha> but I gotta go downstairs to grab my delivery
[14:27:26] <cypha> brb
[14:32:51] <LiveHappilyOnce> Hi, I'd like to bind a click event to $(document), and run code only if that event has not been captured prior to bubbling up to the document.
[14:33:54] <LiveHappilyOnce> It's to implement the familiar method of cancelling a selection the user has made by clicking anywhere on a blank bit of screen.
[14:34:32] <rroelofs> LiveHappilyOnce: I think that means putting stopPropogation in all your event handlers.
[14:34:47] <LiveHappilyOnce> Ah, I thought it might. Bit of a pain.
[14:34:50] <rroelofs> or keeping a list of valid targets
[14:35:01] <rroelofs> to ignore
[14:36:21] <LiveHappilyOnce> Yeah, that's a bit awkward too. Could I parse the DOM to create such a list, do you think?
[14:37:07] <rroelofs> Not conviently.  If they are all bound with jQuery, you might be able to check jquery's event data structure
[14:37:08] <LiveHappilyOnce> I'd need to find all buttons, links and detect any other bindings.
[14:37:23] <rroelofs> yeah, not fun
[14:37:32] <LiveHappilyOnce> Hmm. Ok.
[14:37:38] <chovy> manifest file was screwing up ajax in chrome + safari
[14:37:49] <RoosterJuice__> my clearfix for an element isn't working anymore
[14:37:58] <RoosterJuice__> it's a div
[14:38:01] <RoosterJuice__> inside a div
[14:38:05] <RoosterJuice__> shouldn't clearfix work?
[14:38:14] <RoosterJuice__> sorry
[14:38:20] <yedimind> shouldn't you ask in a channel that might be better suited to answer that question?
[14:38:21] <RoosterJuice__> it's an input inside a dive
[14:38:34] <RoosterJuice__> oh
[14:38:35] <RoosterJuice__> yes
[14:38:37] <RoosterJuice__> lol
[14:38:40] <RoosterJuice__> sorry
[14:38:51] <LiveHappilyOnce> Maybe I'll just check the event's target and see if it's my page's content-wrapper div. It's a bit rough, but it would work for most clicks. Thanks for the information!
[14:38:54] <yedimind> and also the enter button is really only there for when you finish your thought process
[14:39:07] <yedimind> not for each word, they invented other methods of punctuation for that
[14:47:31] <Hopsy> why doesnt this work for me :\
[14:47:32] <Hopsy> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[14:47:53] <Hopsy> firebug give this error: $jQuery is not defined
[14:48:40] <Hopsy> jQuery.parseJSON is not a function
[14:50:27] <rroelofs> $jQuery ??
[14:51:20] <yedimind> Hopsy, setup a test case with your problem
[14:51:57] <Hopsy> I took the example
[14:52:01] <Hopsy> they gave
[14:52:57] <yedimind> yeah, but there might be something else youre not doing right
[14:53:02] <yedimind> that would be interfering with it
[14:53:08] <yedimind> or prevent it from working in some way or another
[14:53:39] <BinaryKitten> what is $jQuery Hopsy and why would it be defined?
[14:54:13] <Hopsy> i dont know what that is :\
[14:54:26] <BinaryKitten> well you have it somewhere
[14:54:28] <yedimind> between the options of you did somethign wrong, or the example that 346340983 people have used being wrong...
[14:54:28] <Hopsy> what i did was just copy paste
[14:54:39] <BinaryKitten> firebug is telling you it doesn't exist.. which is true
[14:55:50] <Hopsy> I had paste this example middle in my ajax function :')
[14:56:36] <Hopsy> no it doesnt help
[14:56:36] <yedimind> so maybe you pasting things in the middle of existing code could maybe somehow conflict with something, no ?
[14:56:40] <Hopsy> i am getting this error
[14:57:14] <Hopsy> no no, I pasted it in the succes thing

[15:07:04] <Hopsy> thanks :p
[15:08:13] <Hopsy> what did you changed?
[15:08:21] <Hopsy> owh
[15:08:25] <gnarf> removed jqcon - added more โฅ's
[15:08:25] <Hopsy> versions haha
[15:08:29] <Hopsy> owh
[15:08:59] <Hopsy> where does that stands for?
[15:09:10] <gnarf> wat?
[15:09:11] <devinrolsen> chovy, why not just loop through them with an each, and when i>5, start removing $(this)
[15:09:22] <Hopsy> this weird char: โฅ's
[15:09:40] <gnarf> devinrolsen: that sounds um... lame? whats the question?
[15:09:44] <gnarf> ahh
[15:09:53] <devinrolsen> well could also use nth-child.
[15:09:58] <devinrolsen> in some weird way.
[15:09:59] <Hopsy> owh, maybe it is utf-8 :o

[15:10:22] <gnarf> chovy: div.find("p").slice(5).remove();
[15:10:31] <gnarf> thats prolly better than the :gt selector
[15:10:40] <ProLoser|Work> what's the difference between .always() and .then()???
[15:10:59] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: .always( fn ) == .then( fn, fn )
[15:11:10] <ProLoser|Work> thanks,
[15:11:15] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: then( done, fail )
[15:11:23] <ProLoser|Work> i gotcha
[15:11:25] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: alyways( doneAndFail )
[15:11:35] <ProLoser|Work> how can i make my own functions return deferred objects?
[15:11:37] <ProLoser|Work> or what-have-you
[15:11:45] <ProLoser|Work> i know .ajax() is already compatible
[15:11:46] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: $.Deferred()
[15:11:55] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: returns a deferred
[15:12:00] <gnarf> you can return the promise
[15:12:06] <ProLoser|Work> what's the promise do?
[15:12:22] <gnarf> the "promise" is the "public" part of the deferred
[15:12:23] <ProLoser|Work> i can't simply return a deferred, i have to specify if it failed or succeeded, don't i?
[15:12:42] <gnarf> it has all the functions to READ the state and BIND to the state change
[15:12:53] * ProLoser|Work is a little confused
[15:12:59] <gnarf> but the ones that trigger... .reject and .resolve are only on the deferred

[15:13:32] <ProLoser|Work> one sec
[15:13:43] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: there are better ways to create deferred
[15:13:44] <gnarf> but
[15:13:48] <gnarf> thats pretty easy
[15:14:20] <Hopsy> gnarf.net?
[15:14:21] <gnarf> return $.Deferred( function( dfd ) { // code in here // } ).promise(); works too
[15:14:54] <gnarf> the "code in here" just calls resolve/reject whenever its "done"
[15:15:24] <Hopsy> what does gnarf stands for?
[15:15:45] <gnarf> you'll figure it out some day
[15:15:50] <ProLoser|Work> it's short for gnarfleton

[15:23:25] <aaroninfidel> Hi, how can I queue animations to a list of elements queued in reverse order?
[15:23:39] <oojacoboo> counter = NaN??!
[15:23:57] <oojacoboo> what does that mean?
[15:24:14] <aaroninfidel> oojacoboo: it means your counter is not a number.
[15:24:22] <oojacoboo> ugh
[15:24:24] <aaroninfidel> NaN = "Not a Number"
[15:24:28] <oojacoboo> this is highly frustrating :/
[15:24:34] <aaroninfidel> oojacoboo: I'd suggest initializing your counter with a 0
[15:24:49] <oojacoboo> Aaaarg: data(0) ?
[15:24:56] <oojacoboo> aaroninfidel: ^^
[15:25:21] <aaroninfidel> oojacoboo: pastebin?
[15:25:47] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/MhCuR/
[15:26:35] <oojacoboo> everytime I try something, I get a strange behaviorโฆ a.split is not a function :/
[15:26:52] <Kaapa> then a is not a string
[15:27:19] <oojacoboo> Kaapa: there isn't an a?
[15:27:27] <oojacoboo> I have no idea where "a" comes from
[15:31:48] <Xenc> will (value === true) catch a value of 1
[15:32:45] <ProLoser|Work> does anyone use the include plugin?
[15:35:46] <gnarf> oojacoboo: sounds like you're not passing a string to some call that requires it
[15:36:00] <oojacoboo> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/MhCuR/
[15:36:02] <gnarf> oojacoboo: try using unminified js, or even a debugger to look at the stack trace
[15:36:37] <oojacoboo> if I get rid of the counter I don't get that error
[15:36:47] <oojacoboo> it's the adding of the counter that's causing this, but I have no idea why
[15:36:57] <gnarf> oojacoboo: well considering that fiddle is missing other things it needs
[15:37:13] <oojacoboo> gnarf: impossible to add that all to fiddle
[15:37:33] <gnarf> oojacoboo: then that tells me you still don't know what the problem is
[15:37:35] <gnarf> so like
[15:37:37] <gnarf> use a debugger
[15:37:45] <gnarf> pause on script errors
[15:37:49] <gnarf> and look at the stack trace
[15:37:52] <yedimind> debugger is too much like asking for directions
[15:37:55] <yedimind> and oojacoboo is a man's man.
[15:38:02] <gnarf> one or two functions up the chain
[15:38:08] <gnarf> should be a call in your code
[15:38:17] <gnarf> that is resulting in this problem
[15:38:24] <Hopsy> oojacoboo: toNumber ?
[15:38:47] <oojacoboo> I'm pretty new to js, soโฆ degugging, I'm using firebug
[15:38:56] <oojacoboo> I know about debugger(); but not how to use it really
[15:38:59] * gnarf shrugs
[15:39:05] <gnarf> anyone else use firebug?
[15:39:07] <gnarf> I use chrome
[15:39:08] <oojacoboo> toNumber Hopsy, not sure what you mean
[15:39:09] <yedimind> oojacoboo, http://fixingthesejquery.com read that
[15:39:13] <gnarf> and you put that shit on "purple"
[15:39:17] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[15:39:19] <gnarf> and then look at the call stack
[15:39:19] <yedimind> seriously, will take you 10 minutes, and you'll be a whole new man
[15:39:27] <oojacoboo> gnarf: chrome is great unless you work with css, the tools suck for it
[15:39:28] <ProLoser|Work> i want to perform an ajax request across $.each() of an array
[15:39:39] <ProLoser|Work> should i be using deferred to fire a callback when all of them are complete?
[15:39:42] <gnarf> oojacoboo: i would argue the oppisite, but okay
[15:39:44] <oojacoboo> yedimind: read that once already, was too broad
[15:39:46] <ProLoser|Work> and if so, how do i pass all of them to deferred?
[15:39:58] <yedimind> it tells you how to do exactly what gnarf is suggesting
[15:39:59] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: see ?jQuery.when
[15:40:00] <bot-t> ProLoser|Work, jQuery.when() - Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[15:40:00] <yedimind> set break points
[15:40:04] <Hopsy> adam j sontag
[15:40:08] <oojacoboo> yedimind: it just says it in passing
[15:40:10] <Hopsy> isnt that ajpiano?
[15:40:11] <oojacoboo> doesn't explain how to use it
[15:40:23] <yedimind> sure it does :)
[15:40:26] <yedimind> Hopsy, yes
[15:40:40] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: $.when( dfd1, dfd2 ) - returns a deferred that is resolved when both are
[15:40:45] <oojacoboo> debugger; let's you set a break point...
[15:40:47] <Hopsy> ow okay, i will read this tutorial then
[15:40:47] <yedimind> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide10
[15:41:01] <gnarf> oojacoboo: find the "break on script error" option
[15:41:03] <gnarf> and turn it on
[15:41:06] <oojacoboo> ok, and?
[15:41:08] <gnarf> i dunno where that is in firebug
[15:41:10] <yedimind> the next 3-4 slides go into how you evaluate that
[15:41:13] <oojacoboo> I have no idea what that's suppose to tell me
[15:41:15] <gnarf> then look at the stack trace
[15:41:23] <gnarf> or call stack
[15:41:25] <gnarf> whatever its called
[15:41:29] <oojacoboo> gnarf: in firebug?
[15:41:33] <gnarf> where it shows you what functions are calling what functions
[15:41:45] <gnarf> and look for the last line of your own code....
[15:41:55] <gnarf> or link me a see ?demo

[15:44:56] <DualDetroit> Okay, so I have a question: What is the best way to load in--and store--HTML? I am currently ajaxing them in and storing them as DOM objects?
[15:49:09] <Hopsy> DualDetroit: you need help?
[15:49:27] <mikesherov_> jsperf is fown
[15:49:30] <mikesherov_> down*
[15:50:19] <DualDetroit> Hopsy: Why do I need help?
[15:50:34] <snover> Hopsy: surely that is clear by the whole โhey Iโm going to join a channel and announce myself like an irritating DJ from the 90sโ
[15:50:35] <DualDetroit> Hopsy: I am asking if what I am doing is freakin' nuts
[15:50:36] <snover> thing
[15:50:37] <dogarrhea2_> how would you get the child without a an id? say it's a slider/
[15:50:46] <gnarf> DualDetroit: I'd store the plain text representations instead of the cached DOM, but i have no clue what the "best practice" would be
[15:51:07] <snover> gnarf: thatโs because you arenโt โstreetโ enough
[15:52:01] <DualDetroit> gnarf: The problem is I have 42 *different* .html files used by different parts of the web application (in the client-side ECMAScript) for various things like widgets, views, and forms.
[15:52:49] <gnarf> DualDetroit: yeah, and?
[15:53:00] <gnarf> DualDetroit: plain strings store better in local storage
[15:53:02] <DualDetroit> gnarf: So that means loading in each .html file in a separate XMLHttpRequest(). I'd like to do it in one request, but I'm not sure how best to delineate the different .html files
[15:53:06] <gnarf> that would be my only defense
[15:53:15] <DualDetroit> right
[15:53:37] <gnarf> well, if you're passing shit around as strings
[15:53:47] <gnarf> no reason you couldn't get a giant json of all the templates
[15:53:54] <DualDetroit> DualDetroit: Would parsing the plain strings with .innerHTML() be slightly slower than what I do now with cloneNode() though?
[15:54:02] <gnarf> why are you talking to yourself?
[15:54:13] <DualDetroit> err, dunno. Tired :(
[15:54:24] <DualDetroit> That was for you gnarf :p
[15:54:28] <Raniy> In his defense, I do it too. Helps me work through problems. ;)
[15:54:36] <DualDetroit> lol
[15:54:43] <gnarf> DualDetroit: well you could still "awaken" the template into jQuery object or whatever
[15:54:52] <gnarf> for rendering a bunch in a loop
[15:55:04] <gnarf> but really
[15:55:10] <Hopsy> why do i still see those weird chars :\
[15:55:11] <gnarf> have you looked at any of the templating stuff?
[15:55:29] <Hopsy> narf: thatโs because you arenโt โstreetโ enough
[15:55:35] <Hopsy> what is that euro sign?
[15:55:36] <gnarf> anyone have "templating" suggestions right now?
[15:55:42] <gnarf> only thing i'm up on isn't released yet
[15:56:11] <DualDetroit> gnarf: Maybe I should just store the HTML as strings in my Javascript files.
[15:56:31] <dogarrhea2_> can you do something like $(this).attr("somefunction", $(this).parent().somefunction)?
[15:56:38] <danzik17> gnarf: Jsrender?  jQuery.tmpl?
[15:57:02] <gnarf> jsrender
[15:57:12] <danzik17> no i meant those were suggestions =P
[15:57:27] <gnarf> $.tmpl is basically dead
[15:57:31] <gnarf> it still works
[15:57:35] <gnarf> but its not maintained anymore
[15:57:42] <gnarf> jsrender is still under dev i believe
[15:57:56] <danzik17> there's 'PURE' by BeeBole, but i didnt like it tbh
[15:58:52] <DualDetroit> What do you guys think of this? Server-side including of the HTML inside the JS files: var window.htmlstrings.someform = unescape("<% print .html file server-side(); %>");
[15:58:58] <ProLoser|Work> what's a good way to send $.when() multiple arguments?
[15:59:05] <ProLoser|Work> like if i'm using $('selector').each()
[15:59:35] <energee> don't know jscript-i want to make a div appear when i hover over a separate div, html is setup as follows <span class="popupscript><span class="open></span><div class="popup"></div></span>
[15:59:56] <ProLoser|Work> how can i make this deferred? http://pastebin.com/zQAbz63i
[16:00:32] <oojacoboo> gnarf: how'd you get that pretifier in inspector?
[16:00:44] <gnarf> oojacoboo: chrome canary
[16:00:52] <gnarf> ?g paul irish developer tools
[16:00:53] <bot-t> gnarf, A Re-introduction to the Chrome Developer Tools ซ Paul Irish - http://paulirish.com/2011/a-re-introduction-to-the-chrome-developer-tools/
[16:00:56] <gnarf> watch that
[16:01:05] <oojacoboo> will do
[16:01:36] <gnarf> the dev channel chrome is way better dev tools
[16:01:46] <oojacoboo> yea
[16:05:45] <Hopsy> lol

[16:07:58] <gnarf> Hopsy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUEM5KsNiCM
[16:08:19] <gnarf> Hopsy: dramaticially read by adam himself :)
[16:10:31] <Hopsy> haha
[16:12:01] <Hopsy> genious! :p
[16:13:29] <yedimind> JAQUERIES IS MY FAVOURITEST
[16:14:37] <dogarrhea2_> is there some way to put functions into elements initialized like so:  var e = $("<div></div>")
[16:14:51] <dogarrhea2_> i want e to have a function that puts stuff inside the div
[16:15:09] <Hopsy> this is also funny :p
[16:15:10] <Hopsy> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r5aAhNk4Ws&feature=related
[16:15:26] <dogarrhea2_> e.somefunc = function(){alert("blah");}  doesn't seem to work
[16:16:42] <gnarf> Hopsy: i think that was the best part of jqcon ;)
[16:17:06] <dogarrhea2_> bah so jquery totally breaks "object oriented" javascript?
[16:17:31] <gnarf> wat?
[16:18:23] <dogarrhea2_> $ is used to make new jquery elements.. but you can't declare functions as members of these jquery elements
[16:19:05] <dogarrhea2_> var e = $('<div>,</div>');  e.someFunc=function(){alert("haha");} ; $e.someFunc() ;  doesn't work
[16:19:14] <Hopsy> i like this videos wuahaahahaa :p
[16:19:21] <Hopsy> genious
[16:19:59] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: yes it does
[16:20:24] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: assuming the $e.someFunc() was supposed to be e.someFunc()
[16:20:25] <gnarf> however
[16:20:28] <gnarf> its like way bad idea
[16:20:34] <ProLoser|Work> this is probably wrong, how do i make it right? http://jsfiddle.net/VArCX/
[16:21:05] <gnarf> e.data().somefunc=function(){}; e.data().somefunc(); will actually persist with the dom element
[16:21:18] <gnarf> instead of the life of the jQuery object
[16:21:20] <gnarf> but really
[16:21:24] <gnarf> its just bad practice anyway
[16:22:07] <WallStreetShark> DualDetroit: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING ON IRC!!!!!!!!!!!!
[16:22:47] <dogarrhea2_> gnarf, how do parent and child elements communication with each other?
[16:22:52] <WallStreetShark> DualDetroit: The GS account is going up and smoke and you're surfing the web?
[16:22:55] <dogarrhea2_> just give Everything an id?
[16:23:19] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: you're asking like a design thing... see ?p
[16:23:19] <bot-t> dogarrhea2_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:23:26] <gnarf> what are you trying to do?
[16:23:34] <gnarf> there are MANY ways to make it work
[16:23:38] <DualDetroit> dogarrhea2_: How does an element communicate with another?
[16:23:52] <dogarrhea2_> i have a slider which is a child of a div.  i would like the parent div to keep track of the slider's value
[16:24:16] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: then store a reference to the slider and ask for its value....
[16:24:40] <dogarrhea2_> eh. in the stop: method of the slider..
[16:24:44] <Ojje> Hi there. Anyone knows how to reanimate a highcharts chart with jquery?
[16:24:48] <dogarrhea2_> ok nevermind it'll update automatically
[16:27:58] <WallStreetShark> DualDetroit: Conf call with the sec in 15 minutes, come on man!!!!
[16:28:12] <energee> if i want to two elements classed ".a" and ".b" with are children of ".c" how do specify to target ".c", $(".c").html(function() {?
[16:28:57] <energee> if i want to manipulate two elements classed ".a" and ".b" with are children of ".c" how do specify to target ".c",     ->   $(".c").html(function() {?  *
[16:29:10] <gnarf> .a .c ?
[16:29:24] <gnarf> if you are looking for a .c inside of a .a.... ".a .c"
[16:29:31] <gnarf> ?descendant selector
[16:29:32] <bot-t> gnarf, Descendant Selector (ancestor descendant) - Selects all elements that are descendants of a given ancestor. http://api.jquery.com/descendant-selector/
[16:30:53] <DualDetroit> WallStreetShark is having a tantrum in the office -- he just threw over a desk and monitor
[16:31:23] <energee> gnarf, these appear several times on the page, so i want this function to execute only when that particular "c. a." is being targeted
[16:33:05] <gnarf> energee: sounds like bad design
[16:33:11] <gnarf> see ?p
[16:33:11] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:35:49] <energee> gnarf: http://pastebin.com/zseKMCxd
[16:36:27] <energee> i want to make .popup visible when .open_popup_on_hover is hovered
[16:37:17] <gnarf> energee: .closest(".popup_parent").find(".popup")
[16:37:35] <gnarf> energee: or perhaps .siblings(".popup") if they are always siblings
[16:38:32] <gnarf> energee: closest walks up, find walks down
[16:38:38] <gnarf> so up to parent, down to popup
[16:38:54] <gnarf> the other option
[16:39:18] <dogarrhea2_> i'm definitely missing something:  var someSlider = $("<div></div>").slider();  $("#theparentdiv").appendChild(someSlider);  alert($("#theparentdiv").someSlider.value()); <--- cannot access property of undefined
[16:41:39] <dogarrhea2_> what kind of "reference" to the child am i actually storing in the parent?
[16:41:49] <dogarrhea2_> am i just giving the child element an id?
[16:41:59] <dogarrhea2_> in that case, it mind as well be global
[16:42:47] <Raniy> Anyone mind eyeing http://pastebin.com/W7iYtQ2D and helping me figure out why clicking doesnt actually seem to do anything? :)
[16:43:13] <miceiken> what lightbox plugin do you prefer? I need one with support for grouping (sort of like albums) and preferably one where I can add comments or/and toolbar
[16:44:31] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/WLjCv/
[16:44:35] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: "storing a reference"
[16:44:54] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: use scoped variables
[16:44:59] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: or store stuff in .data()
[16:45:13] <dogarrhea2_> the problem is i have multiple sliders
[16:45:13] <gnarf> energee: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/WLjCv/
[16:45:24] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: .data()
[16:45:33] <gnarf> also
[16:45:36] <gnarf> with .slider
[16:45:46] <gnarf> its just .slider( "value" )
[16:45:49] <gnarf> so if you did
[16:45:50] <energee> gnarf: still having trouble, this was the original script http://pastebin.com/jyV8d4hH but i don't want popup to sit within "open popup on hover"
[16:46:08] <energee> oh cool
[16:46:11] <dogarrhea2_> just trying to avoid global scope with ids/trouble with updating ids as much as possible.
[16:46:18] <gnarf> energee: thats just one way
[16:47:24] <gnarf> energee: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/WLjCv/1/
[16:47:36] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: see ?data
[16:47:37] <bot-t> dogarrhea2_, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[16:47:41] <dogarrhea2_> hmm . data can store functions maybe? in the way objects can do this.myfunction = function(a,b){alert(a)};
[16:48:03] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: data can store functions....
[16:48:05] <imsky> ahhh a tuesday
[16:48:06] <bot-t> (3 hours 20 mins ago) <paul_irish> tell imsky yo i got ISSUES with cssFX
[16:48:08] <gnarf> it can store whatever you want
[16:48:26] <dogarrhea2_> ok. so that's the "real" way of object orientation rather than attr
[16:48:52] <imsky> ahaha yesss
[16:49:09] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: you don't seem to know what "object orientation" really means, but - if you want to store arbitrary data on an element, use data()
[16:49:28] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: $( "#a" ) !== $( "#a" )
[16:49:30] <dogarrhea2_> gnarf. i do actually. and javascript is basically not OO
[16:49:38] <dogarrhea2_> with no interfaces
[16:49:43] <dogarrhea2_> etc.
[16:49:55] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: new myclass( "#a" ) !== new myclass( "#a" );
[16:50:01] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: thats totally oo
[16:50:15] <gnarf> setting something on the first one will not follow to the other one
[16:50:25] <dogarrhea2_> different address etc.
[16:50:27] <gnarf> .data() stores stuff on a cache that is tied to the element
[16:50:47] <gnarf> dogarrhea2_: so - again, i state, you're not using "oo" in a proper way there
[16:50:54] <gnarf> two instances of jQuery are not equal
[16:50:58] <snover> dogarrhea2_: just because you are unused to prototypal inheritance does not mean that prototypal object oriented programming is not object oriented
[16:51:00] <gnarf> thats why your function isn't still there
[16:52:10] <paul_irish> o sup
[16:52:19] <gnarf> ?eval var elem = $( this ).data( "omg", function() { console.log( "omg" ) }); elem.data().omg();
[16:52:20] <bot-t> gnarf: TypeError: key is undefined
[16:52:25] <gnarf> damn
[16:52:37] <gnarf> old versions
[16:53:04] <paul_irish> imsky: i think cssFx is Considered Harmful
[16:53:04] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/NtpZ6/
[16:53:26] <imsky> paul_irish: how dare you
[16:53:31] <paul_irish> boom. just did.
[16:53:42] <imsky> what's so harmful about it bro
[16:54:17] <snover> not everyone has javascriptโฆprefixed properties are not guaranteed to work the same as unprefixed propertiesโฆ
[16:54:22] <snover> javascript enabled*
[16:54:49] <imsky> then they see a degraded layout..what's the problem
[16:55:03] <imsky> also i'm working on normalizing behavior across all properties
[16:55:13] <imsky> especially flexbox turned out to be a bit of work for IE
[16:56:47] <snover> it is needlessly degraded
[16:57:13] <imsky> hold on though, paul_irish had the issues
[16:57:39] <notbenh1> hello all. I'm having a hell of a time getting the object that was clicked from .click
[16:57:57] <imsky> ?g event target jquery @ notbenh1
[16:57:57] <bot-t> notbenh1, event.target  jQuery API - http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[16:58:15] <notbenh1> imsky: bot-t awesome thanks
[16:58:17] <paul_irish> every stylesheet needs an XHR
[16:58:22] <paul_irish> there is a FOUC of yoru styles
[16:58:34] <imsky> unfortunately, yeah. that's how selectivizr and css3 finalize work, too
[16:58:34] <paul_irish> the parsing overhead adds a nontrivial amount of loadtime to the page
[16:58:39] <imsky> fouc i'm working on
[16:58:46] <paul_irish> yeah i think selectivizr is CH too
[16:58:47] <imsky> and i tested in ie6, parsing overhead is a non-issue
[16:59:11] <paul_irish> (tbh you can feature test for addEventListener and quit early to avoid oldie compeltely)
[16:59:17] <imsky> IE actually took out non-xhr ability for me in IE10
[16:59:19] <paul_irish> anyway i went through this yesterday with a project by lea verou
[16:59:27] <paul_irish> she did the same thing
[16:59:33] <paul_irish> see also ECSStender
[16:59:36] <paul_irish> and CSS3 Sandpaper
[16:59:42] <paul_irish> very much the same thing
[16:59:42] <imsky> yep saw that latter one
[16:59:56] <paul_irish> also if this was adopted widely
[17:00:10] <paul_irish> it would break the vendor prefixing ability that was put in place to protect us
[17:00:11] <paul_irish> SO
[17:00:16] <imsky> wat
[17:00:20] <paul_irish> ITS BAD
[17:00:24] <imsky> that makes no sense
[17:00:27] <paul_irish> also gradient syntax just changed.
[17:00:33] <imsky> ecsstender is x4 size of cssfx
[17:00:37] <imsky> ok, will update
[17:00:43] <imsky> lol bro this is forward-compat
[17:00:45] <imsky> name of the game
[17:00:57] <imsky> you do realize you can't even see the flexbox on the cssfx site without it?
[17:00:58] <paul_irish> this belongs on the server
[17:01:07] <imsky> and solutions for that already exist
[17:01:10] <Raniy> forward compatible is worthless if it doesnt support the 'current' standards
[17:01:13] <paul_irish> deploy-time compilation on the server
[17:01:30] <paul_irish> vs doing the same thing on everyone's computers and phones that view your site.. millions of times...
[17:02:17] <paul_irish> prefixes suck. i dont disagree. but the right answer to it is better abstractions and solving it serverside.
[17:02:49] <paul_irish> clientside reparsing of css is too costly.
[17:03:12] <paul_irish> also flexbox is changing
[17:03:27] <paul_irish> but in a non backcompat breaking way, luckily.
[17:03:27] <imsky> a minute ago gradients were changing ;)
[17:03:32] <paul_irish> they are.
[17:03:50] <paul_irish> there will never be a unprefixed version of current flexbox
[17:03:59] <paul_irish> s/current/implemented
[17:04:16] <imsky> all right, i hear all your complaints, not that i didn't think about them once i researched who else was doing things similar to cssfx
[17:04:27] <imsky> the major benefit here is size over the wire
[17:04:54] <imsky> with very heavy css3 stylesheets, the prefixes are about 2.5x the original code
[17:05:00] <imsky> that's a lot of KBs shuttering down the wire
[17:05:01] <paul_irish> sure about that?
[17:05:06] <paul_irish> gzip, bro
[17:05:10] <paul_irish> gzip is magic
[17:05:18] <paul_irish> gzip eats prefixes for breakfast
[17:05:20] <imsky> oh lawd i need to gzip cssfx too
[17:05:26] <imsky> 0.5k fixes your life's problems
[17:06:24] <paul_irish> i need to make a list of the optimizations people come up with for filesize before they do spriting and image compression
[17:06:27] <paul_irish> because THERE ARE A LOT
[17:06:39] <paul_irish> i'll just assume your images are optimized to fuck
[17:06:47] <imsky> i think you're just mad cause i'm fucking with your css3 please money
[17:06:56] <paul_irish> but plenty of others certainly think about css/js optimization before iamges
[17:07:13] <paul_irish> yah bro you're gonna fuck up my cashflow
[17:07:16] <dwarder> is there a way to find out if this http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ will work with js/jquery-ui-1.8.14.custom.min.js
[17:07:18] <imsky> gonna get em stacks
[17:07:22] <paul_irish> :)
[17:07:28] <imsky> paul_irish: follow me back on twatter bro
[17:07:28] <dwarder> instead of js/jquery-ui-1.8.16.custom.min.js as on above page
[17:07:33] <imsky> tell me what else i'm doing wrong
[17:07:50] <gnarf> ?tias @dwarder
[17:07:50] <bot-t> dwarder, Try It And See
[17:08:11] <comhero> dwarder, file->save as
[17:08:17] <dwarder> gnarf: it doesn't work, is there a way to debug it?
[17:08:30] <dwarder> it doesn't show anything in my console
[17:08:38] <gnarf> ?doesn't work
[17:08:38] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[17:08:45] <Myra> twitter twatter
[17:08:46] <dwarder> firebag
[17:08:57] <gnarf> what doesn't it do?
[17:09:23] <gnarf> also - not sure how much "on edge" you are - but 1.9 timepicker http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/timepicker/timepicker.html ;)
[17:09:26] <dwarder> it doesn't show me the widget upon clicking in my input as in the example

[17:10:01] <dwarder> gnarf: i need date and time picker
[17:10:40] <dwarder> gnarf: anyway thanks, will continue to search for the problem
[17:10:55] <paul_irish> imsky: i definitely found what imsky on twitter you are not.
[17:10:57] <gnarf> dwarder: breakpoints, etc?
[17:11:04] <imsky> paul_irish: i am not kevin
[17:11:08] <gnarf> dwarder: is there a reason you can't update to 1.8.16?
[17:11:09] <paul_irish> clearly
[17:11:36] <gnarf> paul_irish: have you reviewd that timepicker at all?
[17:12:04] <paul_irish> no
[17:12:14] <paul_irish> gnarf: know what the story is with templating and UI
[17:12:22] <paul_irish> imsky: whats ur twtr
[17:12:24] <gnarf> paul_irish: nope
[17:12:28] <paul_irish> :(

[17:14:37] <gnarf> i think he said its still not released
[17:15:10] <gnarf> but i don't really remember
[17:15:36] <gnarf> paul_irish: i can ask him if he shows up at the next grid meeting

[17:16:37] <imsky> i'm looking at ecsstender's site lmao
[17:16:43] <menomc> hi, any admin of http://plugins2.jquery.com ? google alerts just pointed me to some spam on that site. http://plugins2.jquery.com/project/Waitting .... in case you want to delete the posts of that bot
[17:16:47] <imsky> BRO I AM SUPER FAST AND NON LAGGY
[17:17:21] <gnarf> plugins2 ?
[17:17:31] <gnarf> i didn't even know we had that
[17:17:47] <menomc> it seems you do :p
[17:18:46] <menomc> http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Waitting gives the spam too... no idea why G chose plugins2 in the alert
[17:20:58] <gnarf> danheberden: you here? how do we remove spammy plugins ^^^
[17:21:31] <oojacoboo> gnarf: how did you get that line prettified in chrome inspecting that code earlier?
[17:21:40] <oojacoboo> the error that I got was in jquery min file
[17:21:49] <oojacoboo> was there a stack trace you did?
[17:21:56] <gnarf> oojacoboo: yeah on the right
[17:22:00] <gnarf> look at the screenshot
[17:22:08] <gnarf> oojacoboo: did you watch paul_irish's video?
[17:22:23] <gnarf> oojacoboo: install chrome canary if you want all the newest dev tools hawtness
[17:22:26] <oojacoboo> yes, but I got distracted 3x and only got 30 min in
[17:22:30] <oojacoboo> I'm on canary now
[17:23:03] <gnarf> oojacoboo: watch paul_irish again, it always makes your day that much better
[17:23:07] <gnarf> :)
[17:23:18] <gnarf> the pretty print js option in that video right paul_irish?
[17:23:56] <Guest78577> i'm trying to have a clickable button on a draggable element, but it's registering the click on the draggable element, not the button. I've tried the "cancel" option, and I've tried setting the z-index. What should I try now?
[17:27:26] <paul_irish> gnarf: somewhere
[17:27:36] <paul_irish> i have like 3 devtools videos
[17:28:15] <gnarf> paul_irish: devtools is sexy
[17:28:25] <gnarf> anyways
[17:28:36] <gnarf> back to slaving on .mask ;)
[17:32:07] <coops> would someone mind helping me out, I have this script  http://jsfiddle.net/BNsPB/ that some one gave me to make a date picker show the current date in the text field but it only works when go direct to the page, if I goto the page via other pages it does not work. Sorry prob real simple thing, I just know next to nothing about jquery
[17:35:13] <Guest78577> go to the page via other pages?
[17:38:26] <coops> well Im using jquery mobile ( i know this isn't JQM IRC, no one is really on there ) so its doing that ajax page linking or what ever it does not to sure.
[17:40:01] <gnarf> coops: #jquerymobile
[17:40:26] <_zoggy_> paul_irish, planning on doing a new video or slides on best practices/optimize jquery with regards to 1.6+ or 1.7.x ?
[17:40:38] <paul_irish> i am not :/
[17:43:37] <ProLoser|Work> can someone help me out with the deferred pattern
[17:44:02] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: ?p
[17:44:19] <ProLoser|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/VArCX/
[17:44:23] <ProLoser|Work> how do i defer that?
[17:45:09] <_zoggy_> paul_irish, sad panda.
[17:45:13] <gnarf> so loads is an array of deferreds?
[17:45:17] <gnarf> or rather jqXHR's
[17:45:19] <gnarf> but right?
[17:45:25] <gnarf> $.when.apply( $, loads )
[17:45:45] <ProLoser|Work> umm
[17:45:45] <paul_irish> _zoggy_: http://paulirish.com/Dive-into-jQuery-1.7-Performance #sadpanda
[17:45:51] <ProLoser|Work> i'm not sure i understand
[17:46:01] <_zoggy_> hehe
[17:48:33] <ProLoser|Work> paul_irish: inspector bugs the crap outta me
[17:48:42] <paul_irish> go on
[17:48:45] <ProLoser|Work> every time i try to edit css really low in the window, it scrolls back to the top
[17:48:59] <ProLoser|Work> like if i double click on a css attribute to edit it
[17:49:05] <ProLoser|Work> and for every subsequent keypress
[17:49:20] <ProLoser|Work> i am curious if anyone else has this happen for them, i think it's happened across 2 distinct laptops
[17:50:09] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/VArCX/1/
[17:50:53] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: $.when takes each deferred as an argument, you can't pass it an array
[17:50:59] <gnarf> so you need to $.when.apply( $, array )
[17:51:23] <ProLoser|Work> is using apply() the best solution?
[17:51:25] <gnarf> also, you can use .map().get() to make an array from a jQuery collection
[17:51:30] <ProLoser|Work> or should i be going about the whole thing in an alternative way
[17:51:36] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: if you want to pass an array of deferreds to when
[17:51:48] <ProLoser|Work> hmm
[17:52:12] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: nothing really bad about $.when.apply( $, array )
[17:52:16] <gnarf> it works well
[17:52:36] <ProLoser|Work> where is arguments defined?
[17:52:46] <ProLoser|Work> is that a part of apply()
[17:53:13] <gnarf> .apply( context, argumentsAsArray )
[17:53:20] <gnarf> ?mdn function.apply
[17:53:21] <bot-t> gnarf, javascript - What's the .apply jQuery function? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3796788/whats-the-apply-jquery-function
[17:53:28] <gnarf> ?mdc function.apply
[17:53:28] <bot-t> gnarf, apply - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided as an array. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[17:53:38] <ProLoser|Work> ah didn't realize there was a jquery equivalent
[17:53:46] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: its not jQuery its JavaScript
[17:53:53] <ProLoser|Work> that's what i thought
[17:53:56] <gnarf> hence the second link
[17:54:03] <ProLoser|Work> right
[17:54:11] <ProLoser|Work> okay
[17:54:15] <gnarf> the bot doesn't recognize ?mdn it only listens for ?mdc ;)
[17:54:26] <oojacoboo> how can you clear cache refresh in chrome?
[17:54:30] <oojacoboo> on mac...
[17:54:34] <imsky> ?g mdn function apply

[17:54:52] <ProLoser|Work> oojacoboo: apple+shift+delete
[17:55:04] <oojacoboo> wha?
[17:55:19] <gnarf> oojacoboo: cmd+r ?
[17:55:19] <oojacoboo> clear cache refresh
[17:55:24] <oojacoboo> nope
[17:55:26] <ProLoser|Work> what do you mean clear? prevent it?
[17:55:31] <gnarf> oojacoboo: clear the private data
[17:55:33] <oojacoboo> sure that works too
[17:55:43] <oojacoboo> gnarf: I need to do this like, every time
[17:55:50] <gnarf> if you need to clear your cache somethings wrong with your cache
[17:55:51] <oojacoboo> that's a lot of work to clear the priv data
[17:55:55] <oojacoboo> no
[17:56:04] <oojacoboo> it's how the software writes it
[17:56:08] <gnarf> lame
[17:56:23] <gnarf> tell it to use real cache headers?
[17:56:36] <ProLoser|Work> erichynds
[17:56:54] <oojacoboo> on firefox, command-shift-r clears cache and refreshes
[17:57:01] <oojacoboo> surely chrome has something similar
[17:57:23] <gnarf> i've never had an issue with just refreshing
[17:57:29] <gnarf> so like
[17:57:38] <oojacoboo> maybe it's just canary
[17:57:50] <gnarf> oojacoboo: i use canary as my primary browser
[17:57:55] <oojacoboo> refresh wasn't showing a code change until I cleared the "private data"
[17:58:37] <gnarf> oojacoboo: yeah, sounds like your server/php thing is not sending proper cache headers
[17:58:46] <gnarf> or responding to the proper headers
[17:59:07] <gnarf> a standard refresh should try a "cache check" on all the files it uses
[17:59:21] <oojacoboo> mmm
[17:59:21] <gnarf> the server is probably saying nothing changed
[17:59:23] <gnarf> which is false
[17:59:38] <gnarf> if-modified-since / etags
[17:59:41] <gnarf> use em
[18:00:20] <gnarf> like have your "combined.php" report an etag which is an md5 of the newest mtime of the files it combines or whatever
[18:00:31] <gnarf> things will work properly
[18:00:34] <gnarf> even better
[18:00:37] <gnarf> don't use combined.php
[18:00:45] <gnarf> and use a build step that combines your js
[18:00:55] <oojacoboo> a build step?
[18:01:08] <gnarf> yeah - like you push something; then run "make" and it spits out the combined.js
[18:01:25] <gnarf> and then just let nginx/apache serve up plain js
[18:01:29] <oojacoboo> combined.js pulls custom files per module
[18:01:31] <oojacoboo> per page
[18:01:59] <gnarf> have fun with that
[18:02:00] <gnarf> ;)
[18:02:03] <oojacoboo> nearly every page has it's own js file, plus module and application files
[18:02:16] <oojacoboo> the overall system works very well there
[18:02:29] <oojacoboo> I mean, there are thousands of files in the app
[18:02:40] <oojacoboo> we can't throw all the js into one huge file
[18:03:48] <oojacoboo> gnarf: btw, that combine hasโฆ Cache-Control:max-age=0
[18:06:21] <ProLoser|Work> hey does jquery organize anything via meetup?
[18:06:24] <ProLoser|Work> i finally moved to sf!
[18:06:34] <oojacoboo> gnarf: it's working now :/
[18:06:43] <oojacoboo> I really think it was just a canary bug
[18:11:39] <abjorn> imsky!
[18:11:40] <bot-t> (39 mins 20 secs ago) <imsky> tell abjorn LoLoLoLoLoLoL
[18:11:52] <imsky> abjorn: what's up bro
[18:12:00] <imsky> paul irish was talking shit about cssfx like 30 mins ago
[18:12:25] <paul_irish> ?g sfjs meetup
[18:12:26] <bot-t> paul_irish, SFJS #12: Socket Communication, Test Driven ... - Meetup - http://www.meetup.com/jsmeetup/events/17477868/
[18:12:27] <imsky> he hasn't seen jq-wiggle yet apparently
[18:12:38] <imsky> oh hai bro
[18:12:41] <paul_irish> ?g sf js pub night meetup @ ProLoser|Work
[18:12:42] <bot-t> ProLoser|Work, JavaScript Pub Nights (San Francisco, CA) - Meetup - http://www.meetup.com/San-Francisco-JavaScript-Pub-Night/
[18:13:14] <paul_irish> ProLoser|Work: if you can repro that scrolly bug in canary i'd love to have you file a ticket
[18:13:27] <paul_irish> i have hit that before myself but dont think there's been a recent patch on it
[18:13:39] <paul_irish> when a ticket is filed on something like that the team fixes it pretty quick
[18:14:08] <abjorn> but cssFx is neato
[18:14:14] <abjorn> and jq-wiggle is the best plugin of all times
[18:14:31] <imsky> inorite, just take a look http://jsfiddle.net/FuV8R/23/embedded/result/
[18:14:41] <imsky> btw chrome can't render transformed iframe mscrollbars
[18:14:52] <abjorn> you should fix that paul_irish
[18:15:19] <imsky> i love that demo
[18:15:25] <imsky> when work eases up, i'm gonna make tons more
[18:15:28] <abjorn> I know rofl
[18:15:31] <abjorn> hahaha
[18:16:04] <imsky> abjorn: have you seen the css3 tiltshift stuff
[18:16:10] <abjorn> nope
[18:16:11] <paul_irish> anyone remember a tool to help you figure out a selector for an element?
[18:16:27] <imsky> paul_irish: wasn't it a firebug addon
[18:16:43] <paul_irish> there have been a few.
[18:16:51] <paul_irish> i remember a jquery/javascript plugin thing tho
[18:16:54] <imsky> abjorn: http://lab.simurai.com/css/tilt-shift/
[18:16:56] <paul_irish> it actually loked decent
[18:17:05] <abjorn> i remember that too
[18:17:12] <abjorn> idr what it is though
[18:17:21] <imsky> y would one need that
[18:18:01] <abjorn> oh man thats awesome imsky
[18:18:11] <paul_irish> iunno because you're dumb ?
[18:18:12] <imsky> paul_irish: http://www.selectorgadget.com/
[18:18:14] <paul_irish> someone is asking
[18:18:15] <paul_irish> OMG
[18:18:31] <imsky> abjorn: pretty cool rite?
[18:18:34] <paul_irish> yes you win
[18:18:51] <imsky> yw paul_irish
[18:19:43] <paul_irish> <3<3
[18:20:57] <imsky> abjorn: you're trying to lrn2design rite
[18:21:09] <abjorn> more or less
[18:21:42] <imsky> abjorn: http://type.method.ac/
[18:22:18] <abjorn> neato
[18:23:55] <abjorn> man im bombing this
[18:25:00] <imsky> lol
[18:25:12] <richardr> Can I store several elements (objects) ($element = $(this)) in an array, and then on mouseover match $(this) with one of the elements stored in the array? [a] is this possible, [b] does it hit performance hard, are there any alternative approaches? Thanks !
[18:25:32] <abjorn> I got a 66 :(
[18:25:38] <imsky> abjorn: that ain't bad bro
[18:25:39] * abjorn cries
[18:25:47] <imsky> richardr: yes it's possible
[18:26:11] <imsky> richardr: depending on what model of phone you're running, it can be pretty slow
[18:26:26] <richardr> imsky: ah, any alternatives with performance in mind?
[18:26:41] <imsky> what are you doing after you match?
[18:26:51] <abjorn> hmm..play LoL...play Rage...or work on ProtoEngine?
[18:26:56] <imsky> omg
[18:26:57] <imsky> how is rage
[18:27:01] <abjorn> pretty bitchin
[18:27:03] <imsky> everyone keeps bitching about glitches
[18:27:08] <abjorn> unless you have an ATI/AMD card
[18:27:12] <imsky> but i waited a long time for this shit
[18:27:17] <abjorn> then the graphics issues are horrendous
[18:27:21] <imsky> nvidia baby
[18:27:23] <abjorn> but if you have an NVIDIA card it's golden!
[18:27:30] <abjorn> just
[18:27:34] <abjorn> don't turn around really quick
[18:27:36] <abjorn> lol
[18:27:37] <imsky> lol
[18:27:47] <richardr> imsky: this is just theory at the moment, but essentially I'm just trying to track a focus point. you can navigate around these focus points with both mouse and keyboard. I don't particularily want to track it by adding 'focus' class to my element, and having to do O(n) to find out which element has current focus every single movement
[18:27:48] <imsky> got that fast RAM
[18:27:49] <abjorn> they do the texture streaming thing that they do on consoles so
[18:27:53] <imsky> yeah
[18:27:53] <abjorn> nah it doesn't matter
[18:28:02] <abjorn> streaming from the hard-drive not ram :p
[18:28:20] <imsky> richardr: don't do algorithm optimization with UI stuff unless you're locking up the browser
[18:28:21] <abjorn> I suppose if you had a SSD it wouldn't be too bad
[18:28:26] <imsky> oh right
[18:28:33] * imsky wonders if it's possible to install rage to ramdisk
[18:28:39] * imsky knows it can be done
[18:28:51] * imsky is going to newegg to order 64g of ram
[18:29:00] <abjorn> lol
[18:29:05] <abjorn> I'm not sure 64 would be enough
[18:29:06] <abjorn> tbh
[18:29:10] <imsky> damn
[18:29:17] <abjorn> games are giant these days
[18:29:18] <glaksmono> when i do $(document).ready() within header or body, would it ensure that the whole document DOM is loaded before executing the callback?
[18:29:25] <glaksmono> would it still*
[18:29:27] <imsky> glaksmono: no and no
[18:29:38] <imsky> the first no is to putting code in <head>
[18:29:43] <imsky> the second no is wat
[18:29:46] <glaksmono> crab
[18:30:02] <imsky> abjorn: i think you should put in 10 minutes of rage and then work on proto
[18:30:04] <oojacoboo> my score 100/100
[18:30:07] <oojacoboo> what does that say?
[18:30:15] <imsky> oojacoboo: yeah well it's obvious why ;)
[18:30:15] * oojacoboo is designer :P
[18:30:38] <abjorn> cant do just 10 minutes of rage
[18:30:40] <oojacoboo> just put be back on the UI coach!
[18:30:43] <glaksmono> imsky: if we put it on body? yes or no?
[18:30:51] <imsky> glaksmono: put it right before </body>
[18:31:06] <oojacoboo> this is fun :)
[18:31:06] <imsky> oojacoboo: oh yeah you got roped into webdev after blissful ignorance, too, huh
[18:31:27] <glaksmono> what if it's within a div?
[18:31:28] <imsky> abjorn: then work on proto and play as much rage as possible after
[18:31:32] <imsky> glaksmono: that makes no sense
[18:31:33] <oojacoboo> after my partner got scammed by a woman you mean, imsky
[18:31:43] <imsky> oojacoboo: a woman that did what
[18:31:55] <ProLoser|Work> paul_irish: already rsvp'd :)
[18:31:58] <paul_irish> kk
[18:32:08] <abjorn> rsvp'd for wut
[18:32:15] <paul_irish> http://jsdo.it/ksk1015/cLLl
[18:32:28] * ProLoser|Work downloads  canary...
[18:32:37] <glaksmono> imsky: it makes no sense i know, but what's the result
[18:32:42] <oojacoboo> imsky: business partner left to get married
[18:32:46] <glaksmono> you can even do $('body').ready right..
[18:33:00] <imsky> uhh no don't do that
[18:33:27] <imsky> oojacoboo: what's the scam though
[18:33:32] <glaksmono> http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[18:33:38] <ProLoser|Work> actually, i found a bug in face book's modal code and in jquery tmpl too
[18:33:39] <glaksmono> the example gives an example when they put on the head
[18:33:41] <glaksmono> wth...
[18:33:43] <ProLoser|Work> 2 of em in jquery-tmpl
[18:33:47] <ProLoser|Work> but it's really hard to reproduce
[18:33:53] <paul_irish> tmpl is deprecated
[18:33:59] <ProLoser|Work> what's the new bandwagon?
[18:34:04] <ProLoser|Work> mustache?
[18:34:05] <oojacoboo> imsky: well, she gets citizenship and gets to live where she wants to live, b/c she convinced him to move there
[18:34:06] <paul_irish> handlebars
[18:34:13] <imsky> glaksmono: don't worry about that, trust me
[18:34:22] <imsky> handlebars is already old mane
[18:34:23] <ProLoser|Work> wtf
[18:34:25] <ProLoser|Work> seriously
[18:34:34] <imsky> yeah we move fast i know
[18:34:38] <ProLoser|Work> what IS it with you guys and your names
[18:34:40] <imsky> the new hotness is CSS4
[18:34:47] <ProLoser|Work> ie17
[18:34:55] <oojacoboo> 100/100, this is too easy
[18:34:56] <imsky> oojacoboo: but why can't he telecommute
[18:35:09] <ProLoser|Work> is it the same syntax as tmpl?
[18:35:27] <imsky> are you trying to template
[18:35:47] <glaksmono> imsky: well i know that too, but i'm wondering on "what happened" if we do so, so what's the significance of $(document).ready if we have to put it at the end of the </body>
[18:35:50] <ProLoser|Work> wellโฆ our apps already templates out
[18:35:57] <glaksmono> we don't even need document ready "as best practice"
[18:35:58] <ProLoser|Work> i'm not exactly sure i want to go back and tear it a new one at this stage
[18:36:18] <ProLoser|Work> i'm having enough trouble as is converting the damn app to mvc to use spine/backbone (at least in structure if not code)
[18:36:31] <imsky> glaksmono: basically the user can't see anything if js is in head, because it's being loaded. when it's at the end of the doc, the user can see the page before jq runs
[18:36:43] <oojacoboo> imsky: he could have telecommuted, we're still a startup and not making enough money for him to afford the things he needs for it
[18:37:02] <ProLoser|Work> my coworkers are fairly inept, endless spirals of callbacks and timeouts coupled with inline on<whatever> events and html strings in the js files
[18:37:08] <imsky> oojacoboo: so he just quit?
[18:37:24] <oojacoboo> imsky: said. "I quit" and cut all communication
[18:37:34] <imsky> wow
[18:37:36] <imsky> rough
[18:37:39] <oojacoboo> yes
[18:37:39] <warrenparsons> ProLoser|Work: My condolences.
[18:37:45] <ProLoser|Work> lol
[18:37:59] <imsky> ProLoser|Work: hmm... /me takes a look at code hmmm....
[18:38:10] <ProLoser|Work> i started a blog, and i want to work on a new podcast in the same vain as yayquery
[18:38:20] <AlainJacomet> jQuery('.notopbar').children('.content').prepend('<h2>Hello</h2>'); <- What reason is there for that not to work ??
[18:38:42] <warrenparsons> AlainJacomet: .notopbar doesn't exist?
[18:38:51] <imsky> jsperf is crapping out
[18:39:01] * ProLoser|Work beats AlainJacomet with the jagged border-radius of an ie7 div
[18:39:18] <AlainJacomet> both elements exist and .content is lower than .notopbar
[18:39:31] <ProLoser|Work> AlainJacomet: paste some code/html instead of making us guess
[18:39:54] <warrenparsons> ProLoser|Work: My IRC skills are beyond rusty. What's the char sequence for text emotes? Is it "/me"?
[18:40:34] <ProLoser|Work> yes
[18:40:38] <warrenparsons> Thanks.
[18:40:44] <ProLoser|Work>  /fuck you
[18:40:53] * ExpFist slaps warrenparsons around a bit with a large trout

[18:42:01] * bot-t slaps gnarf around a bit with a large trout
[18:44:59] <ProLoser|Work> is canary the dev build?
[18:46:06] <imsky> canary is for people who like yellow icons
[18:46:19] <imsky> chromium is for real developers developers developers
[18:46:35] <ProLoser|Work> paul_irish: how do i make a bug with canary? it's happening alredy
[18:46:57] <ProLoser|Work> makes hulk angry
[18:47:24] <gnarf> ProLoser|Work: canary is like the "nightly"
[18:47:36] <gnarf> but its got a big benifit that you can run it along side stable channel
[18:48:39] <ProLoser|Work> so in the css attributes under 'elements' tab if i shrink the inspector a bit and scroll down 75% and try editing something, 50% of the time it will jump, either to the top or the bottom of the attributes pane
[18:48:42] <ProLoser|Work> drives me nuts
[18:50:15] <abjorn> imsky: man i kinda just
[18:50:17] <abjorn> wanna do nothing
[18:50:26] <imsky> lol
[18:50:28] <abjorn> worked all day then worked out after i got home
[18:50:29] <abjorn> im tired
[18:50:42] <warrenparsons> "I did nothing, and it was everything I thought it could be."
[18:50:53] <abjorn> I've done nothing before
[18:50:54] <abjorn> it's awesome
[18:51:00] <imsky> i can't do nothing
[18:51:38] <warrenparsons> imsky: Most of the time neither can I. But some days...
[18:51:58] <imsky> step away from the puter ;)
[18:52:05] <imsky> 5 minutes later you'll get an idea
[18:52:54] <abjorn> well i end up falling asleep, so i guess thats not exactly doing nothing
[18:53:20] <imsky> watch a movie
[18:53:22] <imsky> or a tech talk
[18:54:03] <abjorn> im watching
[18:54:05] <abjorn> American Dad
[18:54:09] <imsky> lol
[18:54:12] <richardr> imsky: what do you mean algorhithm optimization with UI stuff unless you're locking up the browser?
[18:54:39] <imsky> richardr: if you have to think about O(n), you must have some serious code
[18:54:47] <imsky> if code's not that serious...who cares
[18:54:55] <ProLoser|Work> O(n)?
[18:55:01] <richardr> imsky: yeah, it's serious that's why I need to optimise it lol.
[18:55:06] * warrenparsons is sad there's no more Archer to watch until next year.
[18:55:13] <imsky> linear time ProLoser|Work
[18:55:14] <ProLoser|Work> seconded
[18:55:23] <imsky> richardr: how serious?
[18:55:25] <ProLoser|Work> warrenparsons: new southpark
[18:55:38] <coldhead> -___-
[18:56:01] <warrenparsons> ProLoser|Work: That always helps. But I've just watched all of Archer over the last week or so. That's a tough high to come down from.
[18:56:12] <ProLoser|Work> i started listening to audiobooks
[18:57:03] <richardr> imsky: like i said I need to track focus on elements. keyboard is fine without doing O(n) but not sure how to do this with the mouse. That's why I was asking if I use matching like that how performance intensive is it
[18:57:08] <richardr> else I have to think about mouse crossing and stuff
[18:57:42] <imsky> richardr: why are you tracking focus
[18:58:05] <richardr> imsky: UI stuff
[18:58:17] <imsky> so why aren't you throwing a .focus listener onto elements?
[18:58:25] <richardr> :o
[18:58:38] <richardr> I think that is just what I needed, thanks
[18:58:53] <imsky> welcome to javascript of 12 years ago richardr ;)
[18:59:46] <richardr> imsky: well sort of, it helps tho thanks

[19:04:17] <nospinzy> i just need to toggle a div menu
[19:11:06] <ProLoser|Work> someone mind giving my code a once over to confirm i'm doing it correctly?
[19:11:19] <imsky> SEND IT
[19:11:20] <imsky> TO ME
[19:11:40] <abjorn> oh ill give SOMETHING a once over
[19:11:42] <ProLoser|Work> http://pastebin.com/knbS4vuW
[19:11:45] <ProLoser|Work> haha
[19:12:00] <ProLoser|Work> so it's about my jv.Factory.resource();
[19:12:21] <ProLoser|Work> i am trying to create a resource loader to help alleviate some of the problems my team is encountering with load times
[19:12:32] <abjorn> ill work over HER factory
[19:13:03] <gnarf> ?twss ?
[19:13:12] <ProLoser|Work> i tried to turn every resource into a deferred, and then jv.Factory.resource() is supposed to let you pass a string or array of all the resources you want to load, and the necessary callback
[19:13:23] <ProLoser|Work> it should work so that you can call the method multiple times with different combinations
[19:13:31] <ProLoser|Work> i'm hoping it will work accordingly
[19:14:55] <perverse> does anyone know what i could use in place of $.httpRequest(), since it is long deprecated?
[19:14:57] <imsky> abjorn: you surfing filthy sites
[19:15:30] <abjorn> only netflix
[19:15:38] <abjorn> so yes
[19:17:03] <imsky> lol
[19:17:15] <imsky> ProLoser|Work: what the hell is all that
[19:19:24] <ProLoser|Work> a kickass factory
[19:19:28] <ProLoser|Work> i think
[19:19:43] <imsky> a factory for what
[19:19:48] <ProLoser|Work> loading resources
[19:20:08] <imsky> so it's like LABjs?
[19:20:14] <ProLoser|Work> you can use the factory to trigger code upon domready, upon authentication, upon Facebook api initialization, etc
[19:20:19] <ProLoser|Work> not exactly
[19:20:33] <ProLoser|Work> i'm not sure
[19:20:34] <ProLoser|Work> perhaps
[19:20:37] <ProLoser|Work> heh
[19:20:39] <ProLoser|Work> i know about lazy loaders
[19:20:48] <ProLoser|Work> i just don't know that i have the time to integrate them
[19:20:56] <ProLoser|Work> i'm already fumbling around as it is with spine/backbone
[19:21:57] <ProLoser|Work> the factory doesn't actually load scripts though, all the code is in 1 file
[19:22:38] <imsky> hmm interesting
[19:22:40] <imsky> put it on github
[19:22:56] <ProLoser|Work> hmmโฆ maybe i should use lab, it doesn't handle parallel downloads
[19:23:34] <ProLoser|Work> imsky: you can do something like Factory.resource('domready Facebook', callback) and it will wait for Facebook and domready to be finished before firing the callback
[19:23:42] <ProLoser|Work> you can put in whatever combination you want though
[19:24:00] <imsky> lookin good
[19:24:16] <johnnydavidson1> Does anyone know how to make efficient hit test?
[19:24:22] <ProLoser|Work> includes is what we're using for server-side dom includes (i am trying to move us to templates slowly). auth is Facebook install / authentication, and role is or internal permission check
[19:25:04] <ProLoser|Work> imsky: i'm not exactly sure if my solution serves as a decent alternative to something like labjs honestly
[19:25:59] <imsky> it's all good man
[19:26:09] <ProLoser|Work> i'm also working on an ajax wrapper
[19:26:43] <ProLoser|Work> although it needs tweaking
[19:27:01] <ProLoser|Work> http://pastebin.com/bNYB6y71
[19:27:42] <ProLoser|Work> errors are debugged by default and you can turn up the caching
[19:28:53] <ProLoser|Work> although how you choose to cache may be something different. for this, i wanted to take care of it for the other devs. you can choose to not cache at all, cache per page load (memory) or cache using the cookies, i want to add another option for using client-side storage
[19:29:13] <ProLoser|Work> until i realized it conflicts with the native jquery cache flag
[19:41:49] <imsky> abjorn: i'm out for the night brah, take er easy
[19:43:55] <ProLoser|Work> later
[19:44:39] <imsky> later ProLoser|Work
[20:11:39] <DrPoole> good eveeeening
[20:12:32] <DrPoole> im doing var result = $.ajax({}).responseText; inside a while until a bunch of events are finished (server side status check).  I need to add a sleep() somehow
[20:15:54] <kborchers> DrPoole: don't do that. you should use the success callback to execute code after $.ajax is successful see ?ajax101
[20:15:55] <bot-t> DrPoole, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[20:22:57] <richardr> If I have a bunch of divs that share the same generic structure. And say I had a mouseover event that added 'focus' class if it was hovered over. What is the MOST efficient way to remove all the other focus classes, to ensure theres only one at any time. E.g. removing the class on ALL elements then adding it to element
[20:23:23] <paul_irish> what happens on hover
[20:25:37] <paul_irish> richardr:
[20:26:40] <richardr> paul_irish: class 'focus' gets added to hovered element
[20:27:03] <richardr> paul_irish: focus can only be on one element, you can hover of more than one. what is most efficient way to remove focus on other elements when changing focus?
[20:27:08] <paul_irish> no
[20:27:11] <paul_irish> i'm asking beyond that
[20:27:25] <paul_irish> what do you want to happen when you hover
[20:27:30] <paul_irish> other than the classes
[20:27:34] <paul_irish> like.. color changes?
[20:27:35] <richardr> nothing happens beyond that, i just want to add class 'hover' to an element
[20:27:38] <richardr> oh yeah
[20:27:45] <richardr> .focus in CSS might have a border, etc
[20:27:54] <paul_irish> div:hover { border: 1px solid red; }
[20:28:41] <richardr> paul_irish: I see what you mean. I want to change focus on forms within this element. E.g. might have 4 divs, each contain a form. Focus puts you in that form
[20:29:26] <DrPoole> kborchers: ah.  perhaps i have a logic flaw.  im firing off an array of ids for server side to process and then im updating div's individually based on completion so ... i cant wait for a status 200 as the entire process may take a long time
[20:29:28] <richardr> paul_irish: or, even simplier, if there isn't a form when you start tabbing it should tab through elements of your focus. not the entire page

[20:37:47] <paul_irish> DrPoole: HI HI HIH
[20:38:26] <DrPoole> heh.  g'day sir.  you often distract me at work with links to things that don't concern me yet i seem to read.
[20:38:35] <DrPoole> the way i see it -- you owe me $50,000 in wasted time
[20:38:52] <DrPoole> cash or cheque is fine
[20:39:42] <DrPoole> kborchers: cheers for the link.  i think my logic is a bit off.  will perhaps make some changes.  have a good one.

[21:52:46] <coldhead> it would certainly make things less confusing
[21:54:24] <kenperkins> anyone around?
[21:54:37] <vladikoff> nope! Chuck Testa
[21:57:39] <kenperkins> ok, i have a simple three next div tree. when running a jquery selecter in the $(document).ready(...) it returns an HTMLDivElement. If I debug in the JS using chrome after the doc ready handler, it simply returns the markup
[21:57:46] <kenperkins> trying to figure out what I don't understand
[21:57:54] <kenperkins> next == nested rather
[21:58:11] <kenperkins> lemme pastebin

[22:04:03] <z51> $(...) returns jQuery
[22:04:30] <z51> not HTMLElement
[22:06:34] <kenperkins> that's what I thought
[22:06:38] <kenperkins> and why I was confused
[22:07:18] <danheberden> There's a difference between jQuery the function, a jQuery object (returned by using the jQuery function) and a dom node
[22:07:43] <danheberden> so $ returns jQuery, $( document ) returns a new jquery object containing the dom element 'document'
[22:07:54] <z51> to get HTMLElement you can use get()
[22:07:57] <danheberden> and $( document ).get(0) returns the actual dom node
[22:08:00] <danheberden> aye
[22:08:13] <z51> i.e. $(...).get(0) returns HTMLElement
[22:09:29] <gnarf> danheberden: [ 0 ] does as well
[22:09:32] <gnarf> and more performant

[22:11:38] <danheberden> zomg tired
[22:11:40] <coldhead> gnarf: performant isn't a real world
[22:11:43] <coldhead> come on
[22:11:43] <danheberden> imma go to bed too
[22:11:44] <gnarf> i think i left it in my dads car
[22:11:46] <danheberden> coldhead hahaha
[22:11:57] <gnarf> its not in an "real dictionary" ?
[22:12:02] <danheberden> :D
[22:12:10] <coldhead> it is unsound
[22:12:17] <danheberden> ?mlu
[22:12:17] <bot-t> much like urself
[22:12:31] <gnarf> consider using the proper term "faster"
[22:12:58] <danheberden> it is not performingn't
[22:13:01] <coldhead> you don't say that something which sounds better is "soundant"
[22:13:11] <coldhead> at least i hope you don't
[22:13:11] <danheberden> it is unperform?
[22:13:15] <coldhead> i killee if you do
[22:13:29] <Timmy> Hello, anybody know of a way to get indexOf to work in IE7&8?
[22:13:48] <gnarf> ?ud performant
[22:13:51] <danheberden> Timmy just use it like anywhere else
[22:13:51] <bot-t> gnarf, Performant - Something that has adequate or better performance. Combination of "Performance" and "Conformant". Commonly used by Microsofties but not a real word.
[22:14:18] <Timmy> danhebeberden what do you mean..
[22:14:25] <Timmy> danheberden*
[22:14:25] <gnarf> Timmy: you mean on arrays?
[22:14:30] <Timmy> gnard yes
[22:14:34] <gnarf> cuz indexOf on strings works fine everywhere
[22:14:34] <Timmy> gnarf
[22:14:36] <Timmy> lol
[22:14:44] <Timmy> its on an array
[22:14:44] <gnarf> use $.inArray
[22:14:57] <jazzy_> #replug, Hi all, Is there a jquery plugin available that lets user select, from a list of suggested users, users that he wants to invite? Something in lines of facebook's suggest friends feature.
[22:15:03] <coldhead> lol they called you a microsofty
[22:15:16] <Timmy> ah yay jquery has a method
[22:15:53] <gnarf> jazzy_: yeah, that just spells "reusable plugin"
[22:16:24] <gnarf> jazzy_: i doubt yer gonna find that one
[22:17:14] <jazzy_> gnarf, ?
[22:17:20] <kenperkins> got it
[22:17:23] <kenperkins> i was a newb
[22:17:28] <kenperkins> double calling jquery :S
[22:18:12] <gnarf> jazzy_: </sarcasm>
[22:18:29] <gnarf> jazzy_: you might be able to do something with some of the newer work in the menu branch of ui 1.9
[22:18:31] <gnarf> but like
[22:18:46] <gnarf> nothing that i'm aware of just flat out implements that complicated of an interaction for you magically
[22:19:05] <gnarf> you might be able to use two sortables
[22:19:09] <gnarf> and drag between the lists
[22:19:14] <gnarf> but that sounds like lame interaction
[22:19:17] <jazzy_> gnarf, Thanks! Just wanted to check since I wasn't finding any and did not want to do something that might have already done!
[22:53:17] <danieliser> i know im probably overlooking something but i have a css dropdown menu with a hover on the parent li.. it slides down nicely but the hover out animation to fadeout doesnt work and often the height of the submenu gets altered if i open it and close it

[23:13:19] <s34n> I tried setting document.location.href to a data uri with the responseText from the ajax.
[23:13:30] <s34n> That didn't work
[23:14:25] <s34n> it snags on the processing instructions within the response
[23:21:53] <danieliser> using hover() how can i stop a fadeOut() but finish it? when i use stop and it didnt finish the opacity of .5 or whatever sticks..
[23:22:04] <sasori> question: how to select the id of an <a></a> , like I wanna use this id to query my db  ?
[23:22:24] <danieliser> so next time when it slides in it has opacity of .6 or something..
[23:22:42] <sasori> e.g <a id=1 class='test' href="#">test</a>
[23:23:14] <danieliser> $('a').attr('id');
[23:23:36] <sasori> tnx XD
[23:26:44] <hdtdi> danieliser, i didnt understand what you want?
[23:27:29] <sasori> i think there's something wrong with $('a').attr('id') :/
[23:27:45] <z51> fadeout stops by stop(true,true)
[23:28:17] <sasori> let's take this e.g <a id=1 class='test' href="#">test</a>  as an example, what i want is, i wanted to get that value of the anchor tag's ID ,so that i can assign it to a var,and use it via ajax
[23:28:30] <z51> second true means jumpToEnd
[23:28:48] <hdtdi> sasori, is your id in "" ?id ="1" '
[23:29:53] <sasori> nope..that's just the way it is e.g <a id=1 class='test' href="#">test</a>  ..no href at all
[23:30:05] <sasori> the id is being generated from db
[23:31:07] <danieliser> z51: thank you worked great.. i knew i was missing something simple..
[23:33:50] <hdtdi> sasori, $('a').attr('id'); should work
[23:33:54] <Trisox> 1yup
[23:34:08] <Trisox> its right syntax
[23:34:20] <z51> of course if he has one <a>
[23:34:27] <z51> ^^
[23:34:34] <Trisox> true
[23:35:00] <Trisox> $('a.test').attr('id');
[23:35:13] <sasori> i have many a's ..it's like <div class="test"><table><tbody><tr><td><a></a></td></tr></tbody</table></div>
[23:35:34] <sasori> i see..lemme try that Trisox  :D
[23:35:48] <Trisox> that gets the a with class test
[23:35:59] <z51> $('a').each(function() { alert($(this).attr('id')); })
[23:36:01] <Trisox> if there more then you must loop true them using each
[23:36:05] <Trisox> :P
[23:36:13] <Trisox> like z51 does
[23:36:55] <perverse> hey guys, im trying to execute a callback function that is specified by name in the returned json of an ajax request - any help on how i can actually execute the function once i have the name of it back on the client side?
[23:37:32] <perverse> i.e i get returned callbackName from the server side, and i need to execute the method named inside that variable back on the client side
[23:39:07] <Trisox> how do you execute the callback? click?
[23:39:21] <Trisox> typing?
[23:39:34] <perverse> in this case yes, but not necessarily, it could be executed from any action
[23:40:08] <Trisox> http://jquery-howto.blogspot.com/2009/11/create-callback-functions-for-your.html
[23:40:12] <Trisox> like that?
[23:40:36] <z51> if function is global and name of func in callback var you can use window[callback]() for example
[23:40:56] <z51> or if func is a method of an obj - obj[callback]()
[23:40:57] <perverse> reading through it now Trisox
[23:41:07] <perverse> the function won't be global, im using concrete/entwine
[23:41:28] <perverse> it'll be a method attached to a css selector, technically
[23:41:40] <perverse> or more accurately attached to the specific dom element
[23:42:28] <z51> show json example
[23:42:44] <perverse> im not sure how this is applicable at all, Trisox
[23:43:02] <perverse> hang on, ill pastie this stuff
[23:43:17] <Trisox> well i suggest you setup a jsfiddle cause with out your code its hard to do
[23:43:32] <perverse> i understand, jsfiddle will be useless
[23:43:49] <perverse> well not useless
[23:44:01] <perverse> it will be impossible for me to set up a jsfiddle, too many prioprietary dependancies
[23:44:05] <solidus-river> guys whats wrong wtih this? http://www.pastie.org/2681383
[23:44:08] <perverse> but i can get the portion of code im talking about
[23:44:19] <coldhead> solidus-river: i don't like the font
[23:44:22] <perverse> http://www.pastie.org/2681381 <- that is the ajax callback
[23:44:22] <solidus-river> i'm getting an error when i pass a variable into the function of a live handler but not when the function takes no variables
[23:44:45] <solidus-river> coldhead: lol, so change the theme for better colors
[23:44:57] <perverse> now, inside the success function, data contains data.callbackFunction, which contains the name of the method i will want to execute
[23:45:05] <coldhead> solidus-river: live is expecting just a function name, like poll_form
[23:45:17] <coldhead> if you put the () after it will call the function immediately
[23:45:23] <coldhead> and try to bind whatever it returns as the handler
[23:45:37] <solidus-river> coldhead: so is there a way to pass a value into a function you want to call via live?
[23:45:44] <coldhead> so you could end up with .live('change', 'some strung strng the function returned')
[23:45:51] <coldhead> not like that, solidus-river
[23:46:09] <solidus-river> coldhead: i'm up to learning new ways!
[23:46:15] <coldhead> i usually bind arguments to the elements they're related to with data()
[23:46:20] <solidus-river> i'd rather learn a new way then create 3 functions where I should only need one
[23:46:28] <coldhead> and then retrieve them with $(this).data('whatever') inside the handler
[23:46:29] <z51> perverse, you at least must know about calling func namespace
[23:46:43] <perverse> z51 - assume i know nothing
[23:46:56] <z51> hm
[23:46:57] <coldhead> otherwise you can do this: .live('change', function () { poll_form('thingy'); })
[23:47:03] <coldhead> if it's always thingy
[23:47:10] <z51> where is calling func placed?
[23:47:25] <perverse> the calling func will be entwined onto specific panel types
[23:47:52] <perverse> .NPanel methods get attached to all panel types, but each panel will have its own more specific methods for handling once the data has come back
[23:48:12] <perverse> think of .NPanel as the abstract class at the top
[23:48:40] <perverse> and sendrequest is a single function that all panels will "pipe" their requests through
[23:49:05] <perverse> the server side also has a single point of entry that will then branch out depending on the arguments sent, and send back the relevant method name to execute on the client side
[23:49:10] <ic_johns1on>  how can I get an objects top (positioning attr) value? $(this).css("top") does not work for some reason, and $(this).offset(top) returns an object, NaN. Can I use the latter one, and how?
[23:49:37] <perverse> all i need to know is how i can call a method name from a variable?
[23:49:55] <perverse> i mean in php it's just $this->$callbackName(); lol
[23:50:03] <perverse> thanks to variable functions
[23:50:24] <z51> is no way without knowing namespace
[23:50:27] <Spadeski> perverse you me Classes ?
[23:50:50] <z51> this[callback]()
[23:50:51] <RobertoBlanco> good morning all
[23:50:54] <z51> window[callback]()
[23:50:59] <z51> obj[callback]()
[23:51:04] <hye> whats a good way of display images horizontally with nice effect?
[23:51:16] <Trisox> coldhead:
[23:51:55] <RobertoBlanco> got a question... I am using Fancybox to have an iframe URL in a Pop-Up. Now i have to add "?image=xyz" to the URL, but the Fancybbox will not work anylonger with a "?" in the URL - any Ideas?
[23:51:58] <perverse> im not sure i understand what you're saying z51, is there any reading material, or at least an accurate phrase i can google?
[23:52:23] <perverse> i understand the concept of namespacing, but im not sure how to apply it in this instance
[23:52:33] <perverse> in fact im not really familiar with namespaces in js at all
[23:52:53] <netors> hello everyone.. im trying to send ponts from a google maps polygon via ajax, what is the correct data type?' i tried getting the array from the polygon and inserting into data but i get undefined.. can anyone help?'
[23:52:58] <solidus-river> how do i search for divs with the same base but mutliple id's
[23:53:13] <z51> perverse, javascript namespaces?
[23:53:23] <perverse> ok cool
[23:53:25] <z51> all in js is an object
[23:53:30] <solidus-river> $('select#one, two, three') or $('select#[one, two, three]')
[23:53:37] <z51> and calling func is a method of obj
[23:53:41] <coldhead> ?find @ solidus-river
[23:53:42] <bot-t> solidus-river, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[23:53:49] <sasori> z51: i did it like this inside if(confirmprompt){  $('a.deletecv').each(function(){ alert($(this).attr('id'));})   } ..it pops every id XD ..how to make it like, it'll only pop out the current row that i clicked ?
[23:53:49] <z51> window for example if a func is global
[23:53:55] <coldhead> $('.base').find('#id, #id2, #id3')
[23:54:14] <coldhead> actually you shouldn't need that because IDs are unique
[23:54:21] <coldhead> so the base should be irrelephant
[23:54:50] <perverse> ok, thanks for your time z51, i will continue looking into it
[23:55:39] <z51> sasori, $('a').click(function() { alert($(this).attr('id')); });
[23:57:39] <Trisox> coldhead
[23:58:34] <sasori> z51: thanks...
[23:59:18] <durre> is it possible to easliy bind a json response to a form? load an object with json, and then automatically fill in the form based on the json
[23:59:19] <k1t> hiya folks
[23:59:21] <k1t> anyone alive
