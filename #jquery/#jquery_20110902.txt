[00:00:58] <Veejay> It seems that it's possible to do it through a Chrome extension
[00:08:06] <DarsVaeda> If I have code like this "$(element).live('click', function(e) { //do stuff });" would it hurt if I run this several times?
[00:08:18] <DarsVaeda> or does it simply "overwrite" the last live bind?
[00:12:32] <nail_> it will make the function run as many times as you bound it
[00:13:08] <DarsVaeda> so if I bound it 5 times "//do it will" run 5 times?
[00:13:14] <nail_> yep
[00:13:20] <DarsVaeda> ah crap
[00:13:25] <DarsVaeda> but thanks :)
[00:15:47] <nail_> welcome, there's .die() if you want to clear that :)
[00:16:55] <DarsVaeda> oh that is helpful indeed
[00:17:24] <dr0id> we need .diaf() too!
[00:17:51] <coldhead> $('fire *').die() ?
[00:18:04] <dr0id> nah, $('*').diaf();
[00:18:12] <dr0id> :3
[00:18:19] <coldhead> $('#').dilligaf()
[00:22:10] <tankblergh> hi, guys. I have an array of objects, and I try to find duplicates in the array using "inArray", but never get a positive result even when adding duplicates.  This should work in theory, right?
[00:22:44] <ServerSage> tankblergh: Are you just trying to remove dupes?  If so you can use .unique()
[00:25:33] <tankblergh> not really, the main goal is to identify these duplicates so I can present to the user that row x and row y of his list are in conflict
[00:26:19] <coldhead> like sudoku?
[00:26:44] <ServerSage> tankblergh: You'll probably have to step through the array and create a second list of seen values.
[00:26:50] <tankblergh> maybe so, quite frankly, I have never played and am unaware of the rules of that game :)
[00:28:37] <nail_> what kind of values are you searching for? string?
[00:29:38] <nail_> if it's objects they must have the same reference
[00:30:08] <tankblergh> yes, they are objects, can you explain what you mean by same reference?
[00:30:21] <nail_> i.e, a = [{a:1}]; $.inArray({a:1}, a) wont find it, but b = {a:1}; a = [b]; $.inArray(b,a) will
[00:32:21] <tankblergh> I'm currently using inArray (MyObject, ArrayOfMyObject)
[00:33:11] <nail_> but what's in MyObject and how do you populate ArrayOfMyObject?
[00:33:27] <tankblergh> sec, im reading what you wrote :)
[00:35:55] <nail_> better serialize those objects somehow, that will make the task easier
[00:38:28] <tankblergh> ah yes, I think I see an error here, thanks for the help so far
[00:43:25] <Whirl3d> How do you select all input elements of type text? $("input[type='text']")
[00:44:06] <coldhead> that should work!
[00:44:11] <nail_> or ':text'
[00:44:15] <nail_> tankblergh: welcome
[00:44:15] <coldhead> i personally like $(':text')
[00:44:16] <coldhead> yeah
[00:44:22] <coldhead> but that gets textareas too
[00:44:28] <Whirl3d> perfect
[00:44:30] <Whirl3d> thanks guys
[00:45:34] <nail_> mmh :text wont get textareas will it
[00:46:43] <nail_> it won't
[01:06:44] <coldhead> so long, jerkwads
[01:07:18] <svdv> how can i display a dropdown list with elements and whenever the user selects an element it would fill the input text field next to it?
[01:08:37] <xec> svdv: you can listen for changes in a select list with .change() and set values in text fields with .val()
[01:08:49] <svdv> xec, is there an example somewhere?
[01:09:13] <Whirl3d> $(":text") does not select the textarea elements, but $(":text",":textarea",":checkbox") doesn't work, any ideas?
[01:09:16] <xec> of both together? not that i know of
[01:09:29] <svdv> xec, separately then? :)
[01:09:59] <xec> svdv: yeah just look at the documentation http://api.jquery.com/val/ http://api.jquery.com/change/
[01:10:19] <Whirl3d> aha, maybe it's $(":text","textarea",":checkbox");
[01:10:27] <awesome_guest> hey, I'm adjusting css properties of two elements, and trying to get the effects to render simultaneously in the browser
[01:10:39] <intellilogic> $('#' + RowsTable + ' tbody>tr:last').addClass(NewCount);  NewCount variable is working, but this isn't adding(overwritting) the class, any reason anyone can see off the cuff?
[01:10:47] <netrumble> hi
[01:10:49] <awesome_guest> right now there's a slight time delay between the two adjustments (sliding left and right)
[01:10:52] <awesome_guest> and it looks pretty awkward
[01:10:53] <xec> Whirl3d: you have put the selectors as different arguments to jquery, the second argument is context
[01:11:02] <svdv> xec, thanks
[01:11:13] <xec> Whirl3d: try $(":text,:textarea,:checkbox")  ?
[01:11:52] <netrumble> hi guy, anyone know if in past version of jquery there where any bub into document ready abbreviation? -> $(function...

[01:13:20] <wsc> hi
[01:13:22] <netrumble> please help me
[01:13:32] <Whirl3d> var fields=contactForm.find(":text,:textarea,:checkbox"); didn't work...
[01:13:52] <netrumble> !help
[01:13:55] <wsc> I have a question, themeroller is not working at Firefox 6.0, right?
[01:14:45] <dexter_e> jquery.html()  function..   Why does it add &lt;b&gt;   all these weird characters instead of <>  ?
[01:14:54] <xec> netrumble: i dont know of any bug with the shorthand, but you can try the long version and see if there is any difference?
[01:15:44] <dexter_e> if we use jquery.html() to replace some chunk of html, it looks like : &lt;b&gt;&lt   instead of <tag>   why?
[01:16:31] <xec> dexter_e: &lt; is html-entity code for "<", but .html() doesnt do that afaik
[01:16:43] <xec> dexter_e: http://jsfiddle.net/bktCd/
[01:16:51] <Whirl3d> $(":text,textarea,:checkbox") works. --thanks for your help xec, coldhead
[01:16:51] <wsc> exit
[01:18:07] <dexter_e> for some reason it does it when running jquery on the server.. Are there different ways to call html() to encode differently or something?
[01:18:33] <dexter_e> xec: you're right, for some reason I'm getting this result on the server
[01:18:49] <xec> dexter_e: i'm betting you havent hardcoded the value you pass into .html() ?
[01:19:14] <dexter_e> I'm actually passing in a chunk of html
[01:19:31] <xec> dexter_e: 10 bucks says the < are converted to &lt; before you pass it to .html()
[01:19:35] <dexter_e> xec:     content.html(     $(#template).html()   );
[01:20:30] <dexter_e> is there a better way to transplant div into other divs?
[01:21:06] <svdv> xec, how am i going to alter the value of the input text field with .val() ?
[01:21:24] <dexter_e> I'm using in-browser templates which have an #id and moving them into another div onclick.
[01:21:56] <nail_> dexter_e:y ou can .detach() it then do whatever you want with it, insertAfer(), appendTo(), whatever
[01:21:57] <xec> svdv: $('input selector here').val('new value here') ?
[01:22:09] <dexter_e> I thought    contentdiv.html(   $( #myTemplate  ).html()  )   is the way to go.
[01:22:51] <dexter_e> nail_:  I'll lock into detach() thanks
[01:23:27] <xec> dexter_e: if you want to move something, you can use .append() - if you want to copy it, you can use .clone() first : http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[01:24:24] <nail_> detach() has the advantage of keep data and events bound to the elements
[01:24:29] <nail_> keeping
[01:25:53] <dexter_e> but if I want to access that #id again will calling detach() again fail ?
[01:26:06] <dexter_e> does detach remove the original
[01:26:25] <xec> i think so, yes
[01:26:42] <svdv> xec, and how can i have the input text field blank at first? only change after selection on the dropdown
[01:27:20] <nail_> no it won't be "lost"
[01:27:23] <xec> svdv: what? input fields are usually blank by default? :)
[01:27:54] <svdv> xec, yes but with .val it fills up upon page load :/
[01:28:21] <xec> svdv: well then you've put your code in the wrong place, you want it inside the change event handler?
[01:28:40] <svdv> xec, what change event handler ?
[01:28:59] <svdv> .change?
[01:29:15] <svdv>     $("select").change(displayVals); i have this now
[01:30:32] <alexi5> hello
[01:31:03] <yii_noob> how to show a datepicker with the current dat (today) on a different date ?
[01:31:08] <xec> svdv: what does displayVals do?
[01:31:17] <yii_noob> I've tried 'setDate': +offset,
[01:31:46] <xec> svdv: http://jsfiddle.net/SaJRJ/
[01:31:46] <svdv> xec, http://pastebin.com/4JfSFkwa
[01:34:11] <svdv> xec, i have multiple inputs :/
[01:35:12] <xec> that shouldnt matter, really, i dont see anything specifically wrong with your code, but i dont know what any of your selectors point to
[01:35:36] <svdv> xec, found it thanks!!
[01:35:46] <xec> goodie :)
[01:36:16] <svdv> xec, for name='foo' it's '#foo' and for tag names it's 'tag' right?
[01:36:42] <xec> no, for id="foo" its '#foo'
[01:37:05] <xec> for name='foo' i think you need '[name="foo"]'
[01:37:30] <xec> iirc
[01:37:58] <t3rm1n4l> hi
[01:38:13] <t3rm1n4l> how can i wait for function1 to be complete before function2 is called?
[01:38:29] <DarsVaeda> did something change in sortables from earlier version that will prevent ids from being transmitted? is there an option now that I have to set?
[01:38:31] <svdv> xec, thanks
[01:39:36] <xec> t3rm1n4l: depends, does function1 include some ajax request?
[01:39:41] <t3rm1n4l> no
[01:39:59] <xec> you could just call function2 at the end of function1?
[01:40:10] <t3rm1n4l> sorry it has getJSON()
[01:41:01] <xec> well, call function2 at the end of getJSON's success handler?
[01:41:07] <t3rm1n4l> ok
[01:41:13] <t3rm1n4l> so there is no other way
[01:42:05] <xec> not that i know of
[01:43:02] <nail_> there are deferred objects

[01:51:32] <Whirl3d> What form validation plugins do people actually use?
[01:52:16] <nail_> svdv: a syntax error? :p
[01:52:39] <svdv> err .not:(":first")
[01:53:03] <Whirl3d> Anybody got any experience with validation plugins for forms? Any advice?
[01:53:33] <nail_> .not(":first"), that removes the first element of the set
[01:54:22] <nail_> Whirl3d: the "validation" plugin does most one needs to do
[01:55:02] <dexter_e> Is there a way to  do this:  $('#template').clone().appendTo('#contentholder');  but only grab the contents of the #template ?
[01:55:17] <Whirl3d> Which validation plugin?
[01:56:03] <Whirl3d> $("#template").contents().clone().appendTo(....

[01:57:23] <sahilsk> hi,
[01:58:31] <sahilsk> i need to resize image from center using  jquery animation. currently i'm doing this by settings its final width and height. it's not resizing it from center?
[01:58:32] <dexter_e> Whirl3d: $("#template").contents() seems to convert the contents to a string before cloning.. Is there another way?
[01:58:49] <alexi5> what would be the best way to poll json from a server every 5 seconds?
[01:59:30] <Baribal> Good morning.
[01:59:51] <aaronmcadam> dexter_e: you want .html
[01:59:52] <svdv> http://jsfiddle.net/SaJRJ/6/ , why does that produce gibberish on the html?
[02:00:11] <dexter_e> aaronmcadam:  .html  serializes to string as well
[02:00:17] <aaronmcadam> wha?
[02:00:31] <nail_> .contents() returns jQuery, not a string
[02:00:34] <aaronmcadam> what are you talking about
[02:00:57] <dexter_e> cloning  .html().clone()  seems to generate the &lt; characters instead of <>
[02:01:13] <aaronmcadam> I presumed you meant a template as in a script for jq-template or underscore or mustache or something
[02:01:26] <aaronmcadam> why do u need clone?
[02:01:31] <dexter_e> yeah it is a template but just plain HTML
[02:01:46] <aaronmcadam> why are you cloning it?
[02:01:53] <xec> svdv: you have html in the javascript field :P http://jsfiddle.net/SaJRJ/9/
[02:01:54] <sahilsk> svdv: you don't need to include <script> tags inside javascript frame. just write your code directly.
[02:01:55] <dexter_e> I'm cloning it to put it in the contentdiv
[02:02:02] <aaronmcadam> var t = $( temp ).html() is enough
[02:02:05] <nail_> svdv: that's because you are including tags in your javascript frame on jsfiddle
[02:02:09] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to clone it
[02:02:12] <nail_> ah
[02:02:13] <dexter_e> I have a bunch of templates/pages  defined in <script/text> tags and I just juggle them around on click
[02:02:23] <svdv> ah.
[02:02:26] <aaronmcadam> you aren't actually using a templater then?
[02:02:26] <svdv> thanks
[02:02:38] <dexter_e> No I'm using JSDOM on the server
[02:02:46] <aaronmcadam> node?
[02:02:49] <dexter_e> yeah
[02:02:52] <aaronmcadam> cool
[02:03:02] <aaronmcadam> take it your in #Node.js too
[02:03:07] <dexter_e> yeah
[02:03:08] <dexter_e> :)
[02:03:11] <aaronmcadam> cool
[02:03:17] <svdv> it still has problems though, i don't see Indices and the input field next, i just see the input field
[02:03:29] <aaronmcadam> so you're not actually parsing any variables or anything in ur templates?
[02:03:41] <dexter_e> nope, so far just static chunks of html
[02:03:45] <aaronmcadam> right
[02:04:05] <dexter_e> I have it to the point where I'm using the same functions to juggle the HTML on the server and client.
[02:04:07] <aaronmcadam> html shouldn't escape your tags
[02:04:19] <dexter_e> but for some reason when running in context of JSDOM it escapes the tags
[02:04:22] <svdv> xec: any ideas ?
[02:04:24] <aaronmcadam> yeah there is a module for that sorta thing
[02:04:30] <dexter_e> oh reall ?
[02:04:33] <dexter_e> which module
[02:04:39] <aaronmcadam> yeh the name escapes me :(
[02:04:46] <aaronmcadam> but there is a project somewhere
[02:04:49] <dexter_e> isn't that ironic
[02:04:53] <dexter_e> hhahahaha jk
[02:05:01] <aaronmcadam> sorry I've not actually written any node stuff yet
[02:05:02] <dexter_e> escaping module escapes you
[02:05:10] <aaronmcadam> that'll be my next project
[02:05:12] <aaronmcadam> hehe yeh :D
[02:05:18] <sahilsk> i need to resize my image from center. don't know. any clue guys?
[02:05:22] <aaronmcadam> i need to finish this jqmobile project first
[02:05:28] <dexter_e> yeah this JSDOM thing is amazing if it works
[02:05:29] <aaronmcadam> anyway
[02:05:29] <DarsVaeda> I know it may be a shot in the dark, but can anyone image why if dragging ID19 to "To" will result in a array here but on my production page the id of "ID19" is empty? http://jsfiddle.net/dsm3J/
[02:05:39] <aaronmcadam> lemme think
[02:06:09] <dexter_e> it means you can use the same functions as you do in the browser to modify the state of the html document on its way out on the first request
[02:06:34] <aaronmcadam> yeah I'm wondering
[02:06:43] <aaronmcadam> are you passing it as html or text/plain?
[02:06:59] <aaronmcadam> or does jsdom handle that stuff for u
[02:07:05] <xec> svdv: what is that code trying to do? why do you have a change event applied to a div?
[02:07:23] <dexter_e> I tried html() and just raw append() and it works with append() but starts to insert weird characters as soon as it gets html() or contents()
[02:07:36] <aaronmcadam> I'm wondering if you're taking the html in in the wrong mimetype and jsdom is converting it to a plain string
[02:07:39] <svdv> xec, i want to display Indices <input > only when "list is selected
[02:07:53] <dexter_e> I think jsdom is converting to plain string
[02:07:59] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[02:08:10] <aaronmcadam> what about just grabbing the dom object
[02:08:32] <aaronmcadam> how are you inspecting it btw?
[02:08:33] <dexter_e> yeah it works with the dom object, but I wanted to keep it totally consistent with the way its handled in the browser
[02:08:37] <xec> svdv: http://jsfiddle.net/SaJRJ/10/
[02:08:43] <aaronmcadam> is there a way to hook into firebug?
[02:08:55] <dexter_e> with jsdom ?
[02:08:58] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[02:09:11] <dexter_e> unfortunately not as its running on the server
[02:09:15] <dexter_e> it still uses console.log
[02:09:16] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[02:09:18] <dexter_e> but writes to stdout()
[02:09:21] <aaronmcadam> there is firephp
[02:09:30] <aaronmcadam> yeah i know
[02:09:39] <svdv> xec, same thing :/
[02:09:44] <aaronmcadam> hopefully just a matter of time
[02:10:28] <dexter_e> yeah its totally working as expected with html() and contents()  except it converts <> to &lt;
[02:10:30] <aaronmcadam> dexter_e: are you using underscore?
[02:10:41] <dexter_e> yeah but not for the templating
[02:10:51] <aaronmcadam> try using _.template
[02:10:52] <DarsVaeda> is jquery 1.8.5 above or below 1.8.16 ?
[02:10:54] <aaronmcadam> just for a sec
[02:11:00] <DarsVaeda> how is the versioning going
[02:11:02] <xec> svdv: then im not sure what you want http://jsfiddle.net/SaJRJ/12/
[02:11:04] <aaronmcadam> 1.8.5? are you from the future?
[02:11:13] <dexter_e> hmm
[02:11:15] <DarsVaeda> sorry jquery ui :)
[02:11:19] <aaronmcadam> lol :)
[02:11:31] <dexter_e> _.template needs mustache or something right?
[02:11:36] <aaronmcadam> yeah crazy 16 maintenance releases
[02:11:42] <aaronmcadam> nope fully self contained dexter_e
[02:11:48] <aaronmcadam> it's really good too
[02:11:56] <DarsVaeda> so is .16 > .5?
[02:12:03] <aaronmcadam> yep
[02:12:12] <DarsVaeda> ahh damn
[02:12:12] <aaronmcadam> obviously
[02:12:16] <aaronmcadam> lol
[02:12:25] <aaronmcadam> when would 16 < 5?
[02:12:33] <aaronmcadam> are you sure you're not from the future? :P
[02:12:41] <xec> ?eval .16 > .5
[02:12:46] <Phil-Work> aaronmcadam, when it's a real decimal
[02:12:48] <xec> hrm
[02:12:55] <Phil-Work> what xec said ^
[02:12:58] <aaronmcadam> ah I meant the int
[02:13:16] <aaronmcadam> it's not meant to be a decimal in versioning DarsVaeda
[02:13:29] <angelkoilov> try parseInt()
[02:13:30] <aaronmcadam> so there u other two :P
[02:13:35] <svdv> xec, this is correct , it's just that it doesn't display the word 'Indices'
[02:13:47] <DarsVaeda> anyway then it has a bug I guess :P
[02:13:49] <xec> svdv: where?
[02:14:00] <dexter_e> aaronmcadam: Good idea. Unfortunately JSDOM can't bootstrap underscore yet..
[02:14:09] <aaronmcadam> DarsVaeda: were u using the wrong version?
[02:14:21] <aaronmcadam> dexter_e: are you using the npm underscore?
[02:14:37] <dexter_e> nope
[02:14:52] <dexter_e> I'm using base in the browser
[02:14:57] <DarsVaeda> aaronmcadam:  it works with 1.8.5 but fails with 1.8.16
[02:15:01] <svdv> xec, right next to it (left) i have a <label>
[02:15:01] <aaronmcadam> ah ok
[02:15:18] <aaronmcadam> dexter_e: you can install backbone as a module too
[02:15:32] <xec> svdv: you're </label> is missing
[02:15:38] <xec> your*
[02:16:03] <xec> svdv: http://jsfiddle.net/SaJRJ/14/
[02:16:35] <Baribal> I wanted to ask a much more sophisticated question (after a fashion), but I can't even seem to get this sortable to work. Why can't I drag these items? http://paste2.org/p/1624822
[02:16:49] <svdv> xec, great thanks!
[02:17:07] <dexter_e> aaronmcadam: I think its just the way JSDOM handles scripts it bootstraps in its own context
[02:17:12] <djcoin> Is it possible to bind events to an element that is not attached to DOM yet ? like $('<div>').bind('click', foo) ?
[02:17:40] <Baribal> djcoin, AFAIK no.
[02:17:48] <aaronmcadam> cool
[02:18:38] <aaronmcadam> i don't see u asking in #node dexter_e :P
[02:18:40] <djcoin> Baribal: ok
[02:18:58] <djcoin> It could work, on dom insertion, jquery could check if some events are attached to it
[02:19:10] <dexter_e> aaronmcadam: I asked I didn't hear back in there :)
[02:19:10] <aaronmcadam> djcoin: have u tried $.delegate
[02:19:13] <djcoin> Do not know if there are this kind of mechanism
[02:19:24] <djcoin> aaronmcadam: yeah, indeed thats what I use
[02:19:32] <aaronmcadam> what's it doin
[02:19:38] <aaronmcadam> are you sure you've set the right context
[02:19:50] <aaronmcadam> it should work for els that aren't part of the dom on ready
[02:20:01] <aaronmcadam> so Baribal is wrong
[02:20:04] <djcoin> im not saying it does not work, I was just asking
[02:20:17] <aaronmcadam> ah right right :)
[02:20:20] <djcoin> :)
[02:20:25] <djcoin> Thanks for the help
[02:20:32] <aaronmcadam> no probs
[02:20:41] <aaronmcadam> come back to me if u need any further explanation
[02:32:52] <samrat1> am i supposed to link to the jquery.js in the head or in the body of the html file?
[02:32:56] <minver> I'm look for a Javascript that works like Firebug's "Select Element to Inspect" function. In other words, to select an element with the cursor. Any ideas?
[02:34:46] <zoggy> js goes in the head
[02:35:49] <noaXess> in the moment i work with jquery 1.4.2.. is it safe to upgrade to latest? or better recheck all other jquery plugins i use?
[02:36:15] <ravenzz> zoggy doesn't matter. you would place your js at the bottom for a fast page loading
[02:36:24] <jita> Any idea why this script is not working? http://dpaste.com/607453/?
[02:36:28] <ravenzz> and than execute your js on document ready
[02:37:22] <ravenzz> jita next time us jsfiddle.net
[02:37:31] <jita> ravenzz: sure
[02:37:48] <ravenzz> it seems ok
[02:37:59] <ravenzz> but we need some html to test it
[02:38:02] <samrat1> zoggy: is this tutorial worng then? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BSlmxZWNPk&NR=1
[02:38:08] <ravenzz> this is the reason why i prefer jsfiddle
[02:38:46] <zabka> http://pastebin.com/83SBA4nN <-- sometimes the post (line 6 keeps posting in a loop)
[02:39:00] <ravenzz> samrat1 do you have javascript skills?
[02:39:20] <samrat1> ravenzz: very basic
[02:39:38] <samrat1> why?
[02:39:49] <ravenzz> because jquery is made of js
[02:40:03] <ravenzz> basically you are handling with js stuffs
[02:40:07] <noaXess> in a dialog button panel, can i add any other data? maybe some information?
[02:40:36] <ravenzz> samrat1 anyway. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials
[02:41:07] <samrat1> I just got confused cause the tutorial said explicitly to link to the .js at the end of the body. How come no one corrected that on youtube
[02:41:27] <ravenzz> which tutorial?
[02:43:46] <noaXess> samrat1: normally  js like jquery or any other jquery plugins you have to incpude in your page <head></head> part... you can include a single jquery plugin inside <body></body>.. but the main jquery.js add it inside head..
[02:44:04] <noaXess> incpude/include
[02:45:06] <ravenzz> omg
[02:45:22] <ravenzz> samrat1 don't learn from the youtube video you posted
[02:45:44] <samrat1> noaXess- its shown the same in http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:How_jQuery_Works too. the .js file has been imported in the <body>
[02:46:08] <ravenzz> ...
[02:46:12] <ravenzz> as I say before
[02:46:13] <miketaylr> nothing wrong with puting .js at the end of </body>
[02:46:18] <noaXess> samrat1: as i said.. you can do hat.. if you want. but don't waste time in that ;)
[02:46:18] <miketaylr> s/puting/putting/
[02:46:27] <ravenzz> samrat1 doesn't matter. you would place your js at the bottom for a fast page loading and than execute your js on document ready
[02:46:39] <jita> ravenzz: what should i put in html? http://jsfiddle.net/7kGHp/ ?
[02:49:25] <ravenzz> jita are you trying to do a tooltip?
[02:49:42] <jita> ravenzz: yes
[02:53:39] <ravenzz> jita http://jsfiddle.net/f4BUx/
[02:54:14] <zabka> $('.trigger', this); <-- what does "this" here mean?
[02:55:37] <quicksilver> same as $(this).find('.trigger')
[02:55:59] <zabka> quicksilver: ok, thank you
[02:56:22] <jita> ravenzz: i want to hardcode the tooltip text in the script with $(this).attr('description') instead of using title in html
[02:57:04] <ravenzz> then get the description value instead of the title
[02:58:35] <DarsVaeda> can I add selectors also to future elements? like with the event handlers?
[02:58:56] <ravenzz> jita $('#tooltip').html(tooltip).fadeTo('fast',0.90); here you should replace tooltip with $(this).attr('description')
[02:59:56] <ravenzz> also i suppose that you would check if the description attribute exists and it is not empty
[03:00:13] <ravenzz> but that is easy, you can do that
[03:01:44] <jita> ravenzz: now do i check it? Could you please tell me what attributes are available in a html ? THanks a lot
[03:02:41] <ravenzz> when i say exists i mean that it is within the A tag
[03:03:26] <ravenzz> <a href="#foo">foo</a> <a href="#bar" description="">foo</a> <a href="#bar" description="the bar">bar</a>
[03:03:41] <ravenzz> 1° no description at all
[03:04:24] <ravenzz> 2° you have the description attribute ...but its value is empty (then there is no reason why you would display an empty tooltip)
[03:07:26] <jita> ravenzz: could you please look at this, fratmusic.com. What i want to accomplish is to somehow the description of each playlist using tooltip without actually having to change the playlist. Could you please have a look at it ?
[03:07:47] <jita> ravenzz: currently hovering over playlist produces the title of the playlist
[03:12:37] <Baribal> I have something like this: <div id="container"><div id="element1"></div></div>  <div id="element2"></div> and I want to transplant element2 into the container div. How can I do that? A bit more elaborate: http://paste2.org/p/1624894
[03:15:06] <jita> ravenzz: could you please look at this, fratmusic.com. What i want to accomplish is to somehow the description of each playlist using tooltip without actually having to change the playlist. Could you please have a look at it ?
[03:15:42] <samrat1> what do you guys think? how much javascript experience should I get before moving on to jquery?
[03:17:48] <nail_> Baribal: $('#element2').appendTo('#container')
[03:20:06] <nail_> samrat1: there more the better :) Many ppl try to do trivial stuff using jquery when there's already a "native" way to do it
[03:21:42] <nail_> like, "how do I round a number with jquery?" :/
[03:21:44] <Baribal> nail_, works like a charm. :D
[03:23:03] <Baribal> The charm: http://paste2.org/p/1624919
[03:26:18] <ravenzz> jita http://jsfiddle.net/A2pEx/
[03:28:59] <jita> ravenzz: this is the script http://jsfiddle.net/6u7L2/ and i want to add tooltip to station_mixes a block
[03:33:09] <SergSergiu> http://pastebin.com/wBztBrhp , i want to add "Loading" text after pushing submit button , can help me someone?
[03:34:10] <viper> hi
[03:34:40] <Guest50090> can anybody tell me how to select a specific div by id AND custom attr?
[03:35:23] <Guest50090> i mean i need to select <div id="hi" customnum="4">blabla</div>
[03:35:53] <Guest50090> i need something like $("#hi[customnum=4])
[03:35:58] <Guest50090> how can i do that?
[03:36:03] <nail_> well that's the way
[03:36:10] <nail_> but ids should be unique though
[03:36:16] <Guest50090> but it doesn't work
[03:36:34] <Guest50090> ah ah here is the problem
[03:36:45] <Guest50090> id are not unique
[03:36:51] <Aamir> ?down http://my.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/myhuntingdonshire.aspx
[03:37:00] <nail_> bad! evil! nocookie!
[03:37:12] <Aamir> ?down bot-t
[03:37:15] <Aamir> :/
[03:37:29] <Guest50090> there is no way to do that with duplicated ids?
[03:39:40] <jita> there is a variable defined in jquery var mixes = a[3];, how do i access in firebug ? Or anyway to see its content ?
[03:40:27] <SergSergiu> http://pastebin.com/wBztBrhp , i want to add message "Loading..." after pushing submit button,can help me someone?
[03:41:56] <nail_> Guest50090: that will "work", it's just not good practice
[03:43:52] <nail_> oh wait no
[03:44:01] <nail_> it will only match the first one
[03:44:51] <nail_> Guest50090: $('[id=hi][customnum=4]')
[03:45:25] <uchuff> i've had issues with pages that had duplicate IDs in Internet Explorer 6/7
[03:45:37] <uchuff> (not pages/scripts I wrote I hasten to add)
[03:46:09] <nail_> if you use '#id' that will make a getElementById, [id=...] bypasses it
[03:46:35] <svdv>  how can i have a input field with a dropdown list at the same time?
[03:47:15] <Puck`> make a simple input field, put a drop-down menu on the far right of it and put some data in there, on click add it to the inputfield
[03:47:55] <Whirl3d> svdv, are you looking for an autocomplete field?
[03:48:23] <svdv> no, i was looking if there was an element that would combine the two into one
[03:48:27] <uchuff> ah, nice tip nail_
[03:48:30] <domcat> any ideas how to apply jScrollPane to hidden elements?
[03:48:33] <domcat> ie. tabs
[03:48:48] <Whirl3d> That's what an autocomplete field does. As you type, it shows you a popup list of options
[03:49:34] <svdv> Whirl3d, not as i type, i want to be able to type *and* to be able to select from a dropdown list :/
[03:51:36] <svdv> also what's a good color selecting lib?
[03:51:50] <svdv> like gimp's/photoshop's select color
[03:52:23] <svdv> color picker i mean
[03:57:33] <Ankabout> can someone help me with finding the #hash value from the URL?
[03:57:51] <Ankabout> I looked at the BBQ and hashchange plugin, but it's not making much sense to me right now
[03:58:46] <nail_> If you're talking about the current url you're on, it's in window.location.hash
[03:59:13] <Ankabout> so I can test with alert(window.location.hash); ?
[03:59:25] <nail_> yep
[04:03:36] <Ankabout> hmm that doesn't work
[04:10:22] <Ankabout> nail_, do I need the plugin or something, or can I just do a $(document).ready(function(){ alert(window.location.hash);
[04:10:45] <yii_noob> var obj = $.parseJSON(json); ?
[04:17:36] <Ankabout> oh nail_, now it works.. haha must have been a cache issue
[04:20:53] <Ankabout> If I have a funtion $(document).ready(function(){ and then a .click(function(){   and a bunch of stuff in there
[04:21:07] <Ankabout> how do I call that same function without copy-pasting all the code ?
[04:26:57] <xpd> I need to append the response from jQuery.get inside the div where my code is. any way I can get the closest div to where my code is in the document?
[04:28:02] <jibberJabba> Ankabout: create a function with your code in it
[04:28:37] <Ankabout> doh, and load that code... damn sorry, I'm still asleep
[04:28:38] <Ankabout> haha
[04:29:11] <zabka> $([trigger.get(0), info.get(0)]).mouseover()  <-- what does it mean where in $() stuck 2 objects( $([trigger.get(0), info.get(0)])) instead of one?
[04:29:26] <zabka> do it mouseover for both?
[04:30:36] <Trisox[work]> lol
[04:30:37] <Trisox[work]> http://i.fokzine.net/upload/11/09/110901_21082_needaboost.png
[04:31:00] <jibberJabba> zabka its passing in an array of what ever those functions are
[04:31:59] <zabka> jibberJabba: thanks. so mouseover is valid for both, isnt it?
[04:32:32] <jibberJabba> yeah, you can have multiple selections
[04:33:13] <zabka> btw: how can i access then for example trigger.get(0)?
[04:33:32] <jibberJabba> what do you mean access ?
[04:36:42] <zabka> jibberJabba: for example $([trigger.get(0), info.get(0)]).mouseover(function () {how do i access trigger here }
[04:37:09] <zabka> aaa, ok
[04:37:26] <zabka> i know. just info
[04:37:39] <zabka> or trigger. thanks jibberJabba
[04:37:47] <jibberJabba> np
[04:38:50] <Ankabout> so if I want to change the #hash value in the URL, I need the BBQ plugin right?
[04:46:52] <donCams> hi. anybody here has experience with capturing sound from mic?
[04:49:01] <Ankabout> ben_alman, ping?
[05:34:17] <cups> hey guys if I do something like var vid = $('vid').  Is ther anyway I can access the element function play()  ?
[05:34:45] <cups> without having to do document.getElementByID... is there some way to do it in jQuery?  does it have to be by get()  ?
[05:34:54] <Haprog> cups: 'vid' isn't a valid html element
[05:35:04] <Haprog> you probably mean '#vid' as an id?
[05:35:07] <cups> sorry var vid = $('video');
[05:35:13] <Haprog> oh ok
[05:35:49] <cups> do I have to do vid.get(0).play()  ?  can you just call the function from the jQuery object?
[05:35:51] <Haprog> I think you can just use $('video')[0] to get the first video DOM node for example
[05:37:18] <Haprog> jQuery object doesn't include all methods of standard dom nodes. sometimes you have to use the dom node element instead.
[05:37:51] <Haprog> I'm not sure if I'm saying explaining this correctly but you get the idea
[05:40:10] <Haprog> cups: if you have var vid = $('video'); you can use vid[0].play()
[05:43:14] <nvictor> hello all
[05:43:27] <nvictor> has anyone used jquery uploadify before?
[05:44:41] <jita> I have multi line tooptip, how do i display it using http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Tooltip plugin ?
[05:46:11] <nvictor> jita: what do you mean by multiline?
[05:46:17] <m1chael> im trying to use django-selectable : i've got it working, but i had to put in DOMREADY JQuery code. http://mal.icuinternet.com # anyone know why this is?
[05:46:32] <jita> nvictor: tooltip should contain 2 lines
[05:46:51] <nvictor> jita: well two lines in html context means a lot of things
[05:46:53] <jita> nvictor: first line should display Artist and second line Description
[05:47:04] <jita> nvictor: in tooltip popup
[05:47:09] <jita> nvictor: title
[05:47:19] <nvictor> jita: two divs, two spans, two ps, two anchors??
[05:48:31] <jita> nvictor: something like <a href=# title="First line \n Secomd line">
[05:49:25] <sean`> ?anyone @ nvictor
[05:52:01] <nvictor> sean`: fail? :P
[05:52:11] <nvictor> ?anyone @ sean`
[05:52:19] <sean`> nvictor, YEAH BABY
[05:52:23] <nvictor> \o/
[05:52:49] <nvictor> ok jita, any tooltip plugin will just display your content
[05:53:00] <cups> haprog thanks for that info
[05:53:10] <nvictor> so jita, being on multiple line depends on what your content is
[05:54:28] <nvictor> jita: on your page, the link to yahoo seems to be displayed on 2 lines...
[05:55:26] <jita> nvictor: i am unable to do that. here is the code http://dpaste.com/607557/
[05:56:33] <jita> nvictor: so basically title="By: Artist Desc: description", i want to divided Artist and description on 2 separate lines
[05:56:54] <nvictor> jita: django ?
[05:57:02] <jita> nvictor: yes
[05:57:08] <nvictor> \o/ for eternity
[05:57:15] <nvictor> ok back to the subject
[05:57:52] <nvictor> jita: page={{forloop.counter}} ---> page="{{forloop.counter}}"
[05:58:11] <bob_f> Hi, I'm experiencing some strangeness with jquery UI dialogs. I have other jquery UI stuff on the page that works fine, but my dialog is just a bland box with the content in it - no default title bar and styling.
[05:58:26] <bob_f> It's resizable and hitting escape closes it, but there's nothing else.
[05:58:35] <bob_f> Any ideas what could be going wrong ?
[05:59:02] <bob_f> I've checked and it's definitely using the loaded jquery UI stylesheet - e.g. the box has rounded corners.
[05:59:19] <jita> nvictor: thanks for the tip, but i am still stuck with my initial problem :(
[05:59:32] <nvictor> jita: umm did you see the - params?
[05:59:52] <nvictor> jita: a weird way of doing it, but it seems to be the separator you need
[06:00:06] <nvictor> jita: between artist name and desc
[06:00:36] <jita> nvictor: only i know how to apply that yahoo example in that link, i cannot seem to implement it
[06:01:06] <nvictor> well the doc is specific
[06:01:10] <nvictor> you have to use -
[06:01:22] <nvictor> and this showBody: " - ",
[06:01:39] <nvictor> between title and description
[06:04:48] <jita> nvictor: i did that, it displays in tooltip rather than splitting it
[06:05:32] <nvictor> jita: did you use the settings mentioned?
[06:05:37] <nvictor> jita: showBody?
[06:05:43] <jita> nvictor: yes
[06:06:03] <nvictor> k, without seeing the code there's little i can guess
[06:06:15] <nvictor> jita: jsfiddler?
[06:06:48] <jita> nvictor: ok one sec
[06:09:45] <uchuff> jita: I'm sure you can get it working however just wanted to add that I've used qTip to do just that, it might be a bit heavy for what you need though
[06:10:25] <m1chael> im trying to use django-selectable : i've got it working, but i had to put in DOMREADY JQuery code. http://mal.icuinternet.com # anyone know why this is? nothing in the django-selectable docs say anything about this.
[06:10:33] <Trisox[work]> isnt to hard to find a tooltip now is it..
[06:10:46] <m1chael> also "show more results" isnt doing anything
[06:11:24] <howardgrigg> hey is anyone able to point me in the right direction on how to update the contents of a table based on an input field. This almost works I'm just unsure how to update the table at the bottom http://dcbc.co.nz/binnumbers/form.html
[06:12:08] <jita> nvictor: http://jsfiddle.net/82qd3/1/ if it provides any hint ?
[06:12:37] <uchuff> Trisox[jerk]: sup
[06:13:23] <Trisox[work]> will no help then ;)
[06:14:04] <Trisox[work]> howardgrigg: i would prevent leter input also
[06:14:28] <Trisox[work]> hell0 is valid ;)
[06:14:47] <howardgrigg> Trisox[work]: oh it actually will accept letters when it's finished
[06:14:48] <yii_noob> can I do for a $this->widget('zii.widgets.jui.CJuiSlider', array(.....          'slide'=>'js:function(event, ui) { return sliderCallback(); }', ?
[06:15:09] <Trisox[work]> ah
[06:15:18] <Trisox[work]> nevermind then
[06:19:48] <jita> nvictor: seems like that script is not running at all, it is just displaying the default html with title tag
[06:26:15] <nvictor> jita: have the same problem here
[06:26:23] <nvictor> jita: do you have to use that plugin at all?
[06:26:32] <nvictor> jita: i don't like their way of doing things
[06:26:38] <nvictor> jita: qtip seems fine
[06:26:41] <nvictor> i have used it a lot
[06:26:50] <jita> nvictor: ok i will try that
[06:26:57] <nvictor> jita: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/
[06:27:24] <uchuff> ya i like qtip
[06:27:31] <uchuff> not tried v2 yet but it looks good

[06:30:56] <Baribal> If I get some objects like this: $(".someclass") is it guaranteed that the resulting "list" is in the order as it appears in the HTML?
[06:32:35] <anger> Hi!

[06:36:30] <natrixnatrix89> is it possible to bind submit event to a specific input field, not form?
[06:37:40] <richthegeek> hi - does anyone know if it's possible to use an "accepts" function with jQuery UI Droppable to determine if a particular element can accept the current droppable?
[06:37:43] <kborchers> natrixnatrix89: no, see ?submit
[06:37:55] <kborchers> natrixnatrix89: "The submit event is sent to an element when the user is attempting to submit a form. It can only be attached to <form> elements."
[06:38:03] <kborchers> what are you trying to do?
[06:38:13] <natrixnatrix89> oh. nothing important
[06:38:31] <natrixnatrix89> was just thinking that it would be more convenient binding it to an input
[06:38:46] <kborchers> why?
[06:38:49] <natrixnatrix89> I just have an input, and it doesn't have a submit button
[06:39:09] <natrixnatrix89> and I want that when I hit enter, it returns false, and executes some function
[06:40:03] <kborchers> natrixnatrix89: well, you would still bind that to the form's submit event
[06:40:10] <natrixnatrix89> right.
[06:40:15] <natrixnatrix89> that's what I'm doing
[06:40:41] <kborchers> if it ain't broke, don't fix it ;)
[06:41:02] <natrixnatrix89> if it aint broke break it..
[06:41:06] <kborchers> heh
[06:41:49] <natrixnatrix89> a very nice song is called that.. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-SfKRcVqXg
[06:42:30] <kborchers> richthegeek: did you read the docs? http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/  Look at options
[06:42:59] <Baribal> If I $("#foo").appendTo($("#bar")), but forget what I appended foo to, how can I find out again? Is there a $("#foo").parent?
[06:43:22] <kborchers> Baribal: yes parent()
[06:46:29] <richthegeek> kborchers: so all draggable/droppable options are available to sortable?
[06:46:46] <jita> ul:station_mixes li.active').qtip doesnt seem to work
[06:46:52] <Dave_Stein> richthegeek yeah but its buggy for certain things
[06:46:55] <kborchers> richthegeek: you didn't mention sortable
[06:47:06] <jita> where station mixes is the id of the list
[06:47:17] <Dave_Stein> richthegeek: a sortable will activate a droppable as if its a draggable
[06:47:19] <richthegeek> kborchers: sorry, got confused as I was writing the question
[06:47:31] <richthegeek> Dave_Stein: even though Sortable doesn't rely on draggable/droppable? strange...
[06:47:54] <Dave_Stein> richthegeek: they both just use position.js i believe, but you can get screwed if vertical positions change cause the cached position of droppable doesnt change
[06:48:12] <Dave_Stein> richthegeek: in that case youd have to make the helper a draggable and call a UI function that isnt on docs ( just ran into this last week )
[06:48:18] <richthegeek> Dave_Stein: so call 'refresh' or 'update' on the "dropped" event?
[06:48:29] <SkiOne> So I use chrome for pretty much everything. It has built in JS debugging. It use to display the results of ajax requests in the debugger but now it loads them into the browser, is there anyway to get it to follow the older behvior
[06:49:06] <Dave_Stein> richthegeek: $.ui.ddmanager.prepareOffsets( $('.ui-draggable').data('draggable'), e );
[06:49:27] <richthegeek> Dave_Stein: so call that after every drop?
[06:49:31] <Dave_Stein> richthegeek: interactions are super buggy but ive been talkin to one of hte UI guys and next week we're gonna see whats up with 2.0
[06:49:38] <Dave_Stein> richthegeek: no, thats only if you need to update droppable positions
[06:49:54] <richthegeek> Dave_Stein: ah right - so aas long as the droppable is always in the same place it's not an issue?
[06:49:56] <Dave_Stein> richthegeek: on drop you can detect it was a sortable and move it yourself
[06:50:00] <Dave_Stein> richthegeek: yeah
[06:50:13] <jita> how do i select named ul in jquery. I have named <ul id=stations_mixes>
[06:50:17] <jita> how do i select it ?
[06:50:27] <Dave_Stein> $('#stations_mixes') look at API :)
[06:52:12] <Dave_Stein> jita: your example shows it as an ID
[06:52:19] <Dave_Stein> jita: if its a name that counts as an attribute
[06:52:29] <jita> Dave_Stein: ok thanks
[06:52:31] <Dave_Stein> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/
[06:52:46] <Dave_Stein> $('[name=blah]')
[07:00:12] <larsemil> anyone played with dropdownchecklist.js ?? i am trying but gets: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'dropdownchecklist'
[07:05:30] <Dave_Stein> anyone know why an upgarde to jquery would break onClose event?
[07:06:01] <Dave_Stein> $('#start_date').datepicker(); ('#start_date').bind('onSelect', function() { .... } );
[07:06:30] <Dave_Stein> er im missing a $ but thats not missing in code
[07:07:34] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: is the issue in onClose or onSelect? do you have more code we can see?
[07:07:55] <kborchers> also, what version to what version?
[07:08:09] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: sorry i tried both onClose and onSelect and it won't fire, there is no code other than what i wrote in regards to the picker... it was working
[07:08:25] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: big jump from 1.8.11 and 1.4.2
[07:08:36] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: ive already gone through all my code and fixed known changes
[07:08:47] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: all the plugins are working everywhere in my code except datepicker
[07:09:05] <kborchers> hmmm, and you don't get any errors?
[07:09:32] <Dave_Stein> yeah... i just realized some possible hate
[07:09:38] <Dave_Stein> i laoded my page, destroy it
[07:09:47] <Dave_Stein> and then used the onSelect : function() {} way of doing callback and it worked
[07:11:02] <Dave_Stein> ugh you know the docs dont have a "type" http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/ maybe it wont work anymore?
[07:11:07] <WholemealLoaf> so you guys know how window.open() popups... despite being nasty, are still way more performant that any DOM based dialog (hence why Chrome uses it in its experiments)... has anyone come across any tools to leverage window.open() for modern JS apps?
[07:11:11] <Dave_Stein> compared to: http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/
[07:11:13] <WholemealLoaf> or even any articles on the subject
[07:11:16] <Dave_Stein> like how theres dropover and all that
[07:11:25] <WholemealLoaf> I'm coming up blank on google, just old shit about popups
[07:11:39] <Dave_Stein> WholemealLoaf: i use it when i want to open a new window and that's it
[07:11:47] <WholemealLoaf> hehe
[07:12:13] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: it seems only "create" has a type to be used with bind... weird right?
[07:12:51] <WholemealLoaf> well i guess I'm talking about then dealing with cross window comms (I know you can do it with self.opener and with the reference you get back from window.open) and also wondering if there's a Chrome extension to hide the popup window's chrome...
[07:12:59] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: datepicker is just weird all together and i think is actually in the process of a rewrite. the source is a mess
[07:13:35] <WholemealLoaf> doesn't seem to be an area that's really been explored well :/
[07:13:37] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: well i know ui is in the "process of a rewrite" but i know ui 2.0 hasnt been started :/
[07:13:55] <kborchers> nope, we're still working on 1.9
[07:17:27] <larsemil> i am trying this: http://code.google.com/p/dropdown-check-list/ on http://new.karriarcentrum.se/utbildning but it is not working. i have no clue why, all js files are included...
[07:18:28] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/x2LFH/
[07:18:31] <Dave_Stein> looks like im screwed?
[07:18:44] <kborchers> larsemil: because you are trying to access a dom element before it exists. move that line inside your document.ready
[07:20:18] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: what exactly do you need to do with those onSelect's?
[07:20:22] <larsemil> kborchers: isnt it?
[07:20:45] <kborchers> larsemil: oh, sorry ... let me look again
[07:21:04] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: anything, i have datepickers on a few diff pages and they all broke because we used to bind to onSelect
[07:21:19] <larsemil> kborchers: solved it.. thanks
[07:21:33] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: you just need to move them inside the creation of the datepickers
[07:22:02] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: looks like i'll have to... i hate using that syntax tho :/
[07:22:13] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: no way to unbind and whatnot but luckily i dont need to here
[07:23:02] <WholemealLoaf> Dave_Stein, why not trigger the event yourself, in the callback
[07:23:20] <Dave_Stein> WholemealLoaf: good point, shoulda thought of that haha
[07:23:27] <WholemealLoaf> :)
[07:24:21] <Dave_Stein> WholemealLoaf: isaid to my coworker, "oh i got the answer, it was pretty obvious" and i told him and he was like "oh yeah"
[07:24:29] <blizzkid> Hi all, so i know that i can add a click event handler to a div-container like this:  "$("#somediv").hover(function ....." - however, how can i add a handler to a certain class, for example <li class="thumb3"> ... how do i add a handler for the "thumb3" class?
[07:25:02] <WholemealLoaf> Dave_Stein, hehe, sucks that they broke it though, did you see if a bug has been filed?
[07:25:20] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/x2LFH/2/
[07:25:26] <Dave_Stein> WholemealLoaf: didnt seem that way, just saw ones about it not firing when switching fmo one to another, but im gonna file one if anything
[07:26:18] <austinbv> anyone have any idea why this http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/wzve6/6/ is not firing the fail callback?
[07:27:21] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: im goin with other solution trying to fiddle it but its running slow
[07:27:49] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: that was just to show you how to unbind with this method. you said you couldn't do it.
[07:28:08] <bjhaid> blizzkid: (".thumb3).hover....
[07:28:10] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: oh oh i see thanks
[07:28:19] <Dave_Stein> kborhcers: my brain runs slower in morning
[07:28:28] <kborchers> moar coffeez
[07:28:28] <Dave_Stein> http://jsfiddle.net/davestein/x2LFH/3/
[07:28:54] <Dave_Stein> i have a PHP form builder that I called ->datepicker and then it auto puts the JS to load datepicker, and earlier it just needed to be $('#el').datepicker()
[07:29:04] <Dave_Stein> then all my JS files would just need to bind
[07:29:10] <Dave_Stein> thats why im going with solution 3
[07:29:22] <Dave_Stein> cause in that one spot i can put those lines and it fixes my whole site
[07:29:43] <kborchers> Dave_Stein: that works but if i inherited your code i would curse you for all eternity ;)
[07:30:32] <kborchers> just seems like an extra step and extra processing that isn't necessary to save you from doing a bunch of copy and paste
[07:31:04] <kborchers> just my opinion though
[07:31:48] <Dave_Stein> kborchers: its so when the bug gets fixed i can remove that extra dumb line and its back to normal
[07:31:54] <WholemealLoaf> it depends, using the event is more loosely coupled that just using the callback, but it would still require some more code org. to be loosely coupled in a useful way
[07:32:25] <Dave_Stein> there was no issue until i upgraded so its clearly a bug and all the other ui objects work the same way
[07:35:13] <WholemealLoaf> Dave_Stein, quick thought if they do fix that bug and you don't notice, your datepickers will be firing the event twice. might be better to use a different event name for your workaround.
[07:35:23] <WholemealLoaf> anyway i'm off, bai
[07:36:29] <Dave_Stein> yeah i thought of that
[07:36:41] <Dave_Stein> i'll mark it down to check when we upgarde
[07:39:12] <austinbv> why would a deferred callback not fire for a 500 error http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/wzve6/6/
[07:40:19] <ris> is there any common reason I might not be able to add a class to an element (a <button> in this case)?
[07:40:45] <austinbv> how are you adding the class ris
[07:41:06] <ris> .addClass ()
[07:41:21] <ris> i can remove classes - i've definitely got the right element
[07:41:27] <geekbuntu> austinbv, a 500 is a server side response - usually js only gives object or not found type errors
[07:42:06] <ris> there isn't a handler that i dont know about called when a class is added is there?
[07:42:47] <austinbv> according to this line geekbuntu shouldnt the 500 have an ajax error https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L520
[07:43:13] <austinbv> or run the successful callback?
[07:43:51] <mathi> hi
[07:43:54] <austinbv> it shouldn't just do nothing
[07:44:32] <mathi> in an AJAX success callback I have the following: success: function(data) { response( data );
[07:44:38] <mathi> but I don't see any function "response"
[07:44:45] <nail_> austinbv: it's because of the wya you pass the ajax requests to when()
[07:45:09] <mathi> anyone has an idea what this could be ?
[07:45:33] <nail_> austinbv: why the $.when.apply($, requests) ?
[07:45:40] <nail_> it should be $.when.apply(requests)
[07:46:06] <austinbv> because in my application I pass about 30 requests and when takes a list of params not an array
[07:46:14] <austinbv> so you use apply to split the array into params
[07:46:36] <nail_> yes, but why the $?
[07:46:55] <nail_> it will work if you leave that out, when.apply(requests)
[07:47:26] <zabka> http://pastebin.com/83SBA4nN <-- the post (line 6) keeps posting in a loop
[07:47:32] <austinbv> I don't know someone in here I think told me to add the $
[07:47:45] <mattyh88> i'm trying to do this jquery accordion. but i'm not seeing the accordion. i've set the header to be $("#accordion").accordion({ header: '.testacc' }) in the document.ready function and have setup the correct HTML syntax (except I use <tr class="testacc"> instead of <h3>as it says on the jquery page http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Accordion. what could i be doing wrong here?
[07:48:09] <geekbuntu> austinbv, the problem is mostly likely with how the ajax file is connecting
[07:48:12] <austinbv> wow why did I do that
[07:48:25] <austinbv> nail_: removing the $ was all it needed
[07:48:44] <geekbuntu> sry - connect to ubuntu via vnc - just now saw nail was answering
[07:48:57] <austinbv> geekbuntu: its all good
[07:49:01] <austinbv> it was the $ in the apply
[07:49:07] <austinbv> which I am not sure why I put in there
[07:49:48] <austinbv> oh I did it so the this would reffer to jquery nail_
[07:50:21] <davidw> https://github.com/maranomynet/linkify/network - anyone used this?  I'm a bit reticent as one of the forks is "made it work in IE"
[07:50:52] <austinbv> nail_: it solved my problem but dont you need the $ so this refers to the right thing?
[07:53:17] <davidw> or if anyone has other ideas about how to go about finding links and... well, linking them
[07:53:50] <austinbv> davidw?
[07:54:52] <davidw> austinbv, I have some text with things like "http://www.foobar.com" or "www.dedasys.com" in it.  I'd like to turn the ones that aren't already linked into hyperlinks
[07:55:38] <austinbv> and nail_ that solution actually didn't work http://jsfiddle.net/wzve6/7/
[07:56:31] <ajpiano> the first arg to apply needs to be the scope
[07:56:51] <ajpiano> .apply(null, requests) or apply(jQuery, requests) etc
[07:57:47] <austinbv> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/wzve6/8/ with null I get no call back
[07:58:24] <austinbv> ajpiano: and jQuery no callback
[07:59:36] <ajpiano> austinbv: i have a feeling it has to do with the fact that you're doing jsonp and waiting for an error condition
[07:59:52] <ajpiano> there isn't error trapping on JSONP calls in jQuery because it can't be done x-browser without a sniff
[08:00:10] <ajpiano> ?g jquery-jsonp jaubourg
[08:00:11] <bot-t> ajpiano, #8744 (.ajax() jsonp requests are not handled ... - Bug Tracker - jQuery - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8744
[08:00:13] <ajpiano> damn
[08:00:24] <ajpiano> http://code.google.com/p/jquery-jsonp/
[08:00:27] <austinbv> hm
[08:00:34] <ajpiano> that has an error callback, but i don't know if it implements dfd
[08:00:42] <austinbv> dfd?
[08:00:46] <ajpiano> deferred
[08:00:50] <austinbv> ah
[08:01:06] <austinbv> there is no other way with out getting xdomain errors
[08:01:24] <austinbv> but I have to handel the 500 somehow because topsy loves throwing them
[08:01:25] <ajpiano> austinbv: does it work when you don't use a garbage URL?
[08:01:37] <austinbv> no I tried having it go to a 404
[08:02:08] <austinbv> and then used php to throw a 503 and a 301
[08:02:10] <ajpiano> austinbv: the only way to get errors on jsonp calls is to use that jquery-jsonp plugin
[08:02:19] <ajpiano> to catch them on the client side, that is
[08:02:47] <austinbv> so jQuery just doesn't recieve anything?
[08:03:26] <austinbv> does jquery-jsonp work with deferreds?
[08:04:35] <austinbv> I am not seeing it anywhere
[08:07:10] <austinbv> ajpiano: doesn't look like it does
[08:07:26] <ajpiano> indeed
[08:07:34] <ajpiano> it was last touched before dfd's even existed in jquery
[08:07:57] <austinbv> yeah, which means I need to write it or am SOL
[08:08:41] <austinbv> and there is no way to use just plain old json with out getting xdomain errors is there
[08:08:50] <ajpiano> you could use a server side proxy
[08:10:28] <austinbv> the whole app is client side
[08:11:11] <ajpiano> welp
[08:11:19] <ajpiano> you can add deferreds into jquery-jsonp i gues
[08:11:20] <austinbv> yup I am f'd
[08:11:24] <ajpiano> no you're not
[08:12:29] <austinbv> that's what I will do
[08:12:39] <austinbv> but this is for a small project for a class that is due today
[08:12:50] <ajpiano> ah
[08:12:51] <austinbv> so I am not adding deferred to jquery-jsonp atm
[08:13:10] <ajpiano> well at least i can feel good about not stopping doing work to help implement it either ;)
[08:13:35] <austinbv> a religious studies course http://biebervsreligion.com
[08:13:38] <austinbv> I will do it
[08:13:43] <austinbv> just not for the project today :P
[08:16:29] <kmedia> i have different links on a page and i want to have a jquery effect such that when i hover over one link all others reduce opacity. any ideas on how to accomplish this
[08:16:45] <austinbv> ajpiano: I did the project b/c I wanted to figure out deferrreds and you have been an awesome help
[08:17:00] <ajpiano> ah nice
[08:17:08] <ajpiano> good stuff :)
[08:17:44] <austinbv> so thanks a lot
[08:18:04] <ajpiano> welcome, glad i could help
[08:19:11] <kborchers> kmedia: just give all of the links a common class, then in the mouseover event binding, just reduce opacity on all elements with that class, minus the one triggering the event and the return opacity on mouseout
[08:21:15] <TheAbacus> Is there a way to have jQuery.ajax() error silently? Occasionally, it may be pulling in a blank file and currently it throws a "no element found". I tried, setting error in the ajax call, and that didn't see to help. Thoughts? var data = jQuery.ajax({url: path,async: false}).responseText;
[08:21:45] <ajpiano> ajax will normally error silently
[08:22:14] <TheAbacus> ajpiano: Hmmm, well how come it is throwing an error in the Error Console in FF?
[08:22:33] <TheAbacus> ajpiano: I have read that in my research...but not sure why it isn't reacting that way.
[08:22:34] <yii_noob>   how to style the colour of a calendar cell in datepicker please?
[08:22:34] <ajpiano> is responseText actually existing on the blank ajax calls?
[08:22:53] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano do you ever use jquery template?
[08:22:55] <ajpiano> TheAbacus: there' a difference between it silently erroring and you trying to access a nonexistent property on an obj
[08:22:58] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: i haven't
[08:23:03] <ajpiano> i use handlebars mostly these days
[08:23:14] <ajpiano> kinda want to try out tmpl but also hum,
[08:23:36] <TheAbacus> ajpiano: I am not trying access the property.
[08:23:40] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano i cant find a way to execute JS within the template on a variable... going to check out handlebars
[08:23:52] <ajpiano> don't write arbitrary js in your templates :p
[08:24:03] <ajpiano> handelbars makes you use helpers
[08:24:03] <Dave_Stein> i just want to call a truncate function on a value inside
[08:24:06] <Dave_Stein> i guess i can truncate inside
[08:24:08] <Dave_Stein> er
[08:24:13] <Dave_Stein> i can truncate in my controller before passing to view anyway
[08:24:34] <erichynds> Dave_Stein: use a format helper
[08:25:25] <Dave_Stein> erichynds does tmpl have helper power, or are you referring to handlebras?
[08:25:27] <Dave_Stein> *handlebars
[08:25:40] <erichynds> both
[08:25:46] <erichynds> here's jquery tmpl: http://jsfiddle.net/markcoleman/GwpmW/1/
[08:26:46] <Dave_Stein> erichynds: thx didn't catch that in the docs
[08:26:58] <erichynds> yeah, i can't find it either :)
[08:29:15] <Dave_Stein> erichynds: is there a way to globally give all .tmpl a set of helpers or do you need to pass it in every time?
[08:29:26] <Dave_Stein> erichynds: i dont want to have to pass my truncate function everywhere for instance
[08:29:32] <erichynds> I'm not sure. I too use handlebars and not jquery's solution
[08:29:49] <erichynds> you can do that with handlebars though
[08:29:58] <erichynds> w/ block helpers
[08:30:22] <Dave_Stein> decisions decisions :)
[08:30:37] <jQuerier123> decisions 4 what
[08:30:46] <Dave_Stein> which plugin to use ;)
[08:30:52] <jQuerier123> oh
[08:30:53] <Dave_Stein> whats the advantage of a helper vs passing the template the data pre-truncated
[08:31:08] <jQuerier123> idk.
[08:31:15] <erichynds> Dave_Stein: if you ever need the data non-truncated it won't be available
[08:31:23] <jQuerier123> does anyone here know $.post()?
[08:31:39] <erichynds> which may be fine in your case
[08:31:52] <Dave_Stein> yeah i think it is
[08:32:16] <jQuerier123> ?
[08:32:22] <Dave_Stein> jQuerier123 yes
[08:33:00] <Dave_Stein> erichynds: im passing in a "Model" object to the view script and calling .get('name') on it but I can put the truncate function in my main "ModeL" that all others extend
[08:33:17] <jQuerier123> for the { } in $.post you have something:something, right
[08:33:22] <Dave_Stein> erichynds: and do .truncate( 'name', 5 ) in view
[08:33:24] <xp_prg> I have $.get('myurl') and I want to send a url argument gallery=Test_Gallery, how do I do that?
[08:33:28] <erichynds> Dave_Stein: yep, taht wounds good
[08:33:38] <jQuerier123> the first something is the jquery variable
[08:33:38] <erichynds> that and sounds
[08:33:40] <erichynds> heh
[08:33:44] <jQuerier123> right?
[08:33:45] <Dave_Stein> jQuerier123: you dont NEED to but then that defeats the purpose of post, and id do $.get instead
[08:33:50] <ajpiano> xp_prg: $.get("myurl", {gallery: "Test_Gallery"});
[08:34:21] <ajpiano> Dave_Stein: how does passing post data defeat the purpose of post :/
[08:34:30] <jQuerier123> whats the purpose of post?
[08:34:35] <ajpiano> posting data
[08:34:36] <ajpiano> :p
[08:34:45] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano i said NOT cause i said its not required :)
[08:34:57] <Dave_Stein> ajpiano: you can do $.post(url) and it will still fire with no post params
[08:35:01] <ajpiano> ofc
[08:35:03] <jQuerier123> but which one is which
[08:35:17] <ajpiano> huh?
[08:35:22] <Dave_Stein> jQuerier123 do you want to pass data or not
[08:35:31] <jQuerier123>  yes pass data
[08:35:36] <ClemensTolboom> Hi, is there a jquery way to do this css : div:before { content: "I am a DIV"; }
[08:35:42] <Dave_Stein> jQuerier123 $.post( url, { a : 1 } );
[08:35:53] <ClemensTolboom> jquery.before is not it
[08:36:01] <erichynds> ClemensTolboom: $("<div>").insertBefore("#foo")
[08:36:02] <jQuerier123> is a the php var?
[08:36:16] <jQuerier123> brb
[08:36:25] <Dave_Stein> jQuerier123 its whatever var you want mapped toa value, id recommend reading about objects if that bit is confusing
[08:36:41] <ajpiano> ClemensTolboom: i don't think you can set the css psuedo elems using jquery
[08:36:45] <ajpiano> using .css
[08:36:47] <ajpiano> if that's what you're using
[08:36:49] <ajpiano> asking*
[08:38:17] <ClemensTolboom> ajpiano: pseudo selector through $('div:before').css â¦ interesting
[08:38:24] <discorpia> what is the easiest way to "emulate" a select box choice using jquery, i.e. to set the dropdown value and trigger the events associated with it?
[08:38:42] <ajpiano> i am saying that that *won't* work
[08:38:50] <ajpiano> ClemensTolboom: but if it does, let me know
[08:40:03] <xp_prg> ok, next weird questino I have this:  <a href='wow'><img src='wow.jpg' id='first_img'/></a>  what is the jquery to get the id value of first_img ?
[08:41:20] * ClemensTolboom reading http://css-tricks.com/5762-pseudo-class-selectors/
[08:41:41] <daleharvey> given a div with a bunch of ul's with in. I want to find the first li
[08:41:56] <erichynds> xp_prg: .attr("id") will give you the id once you've selected the element
[08:42:03] <ajpiano> daleharvey: $("#somediv li").first()
[08:42:58] <xp_prg> actually I asked this wrong I have this:  <a href='wow.html' title='wow'>blah</a>  I want to get the title, should I just put an id in there?
[08:43:11] <ajpiano> $("a").attr("title")
[08:43:26] <daleharvey> duh that was easy, cheers
[08:43:29] <kborchers> ajpiano: do you know if there is any difference in performance in the way i was about to tell him which was $("#somediv li:first"); ? i guess i could perf it
[08:43:31] <ajpiano> xp_prg: we're only gonna spoonfeed you for so long before you have to like, start perusing the docs a bit more
[08:43:42] <ajpiano> kborchers: jquery custom pseudo selectors suck the big one
[08:43:44] <ajpiano> perf wise
[08:43:47] <xp_prg> I hear you on that ajpiano, I have come a long way in 4 days :>
[08:43:56] <xp_prg> you would be quite surprised
[08:44:05] <ajpiano> so have i, i went from  new york to boston
[08:50:54] <starsinmypockets> A good online tester for jquery / html?
[08:53:02] <whallz> hello, i have an issue with keyup event, it fires multiple times
[08:53:22] <whallz> i trying to detect the enter key when focus is on an input
[08:53:32] <Brodingo> starsinmypockets jsfiddle.net
[08:54:07] <whallz> but the event if fired 9 times, sometimes less
[08:54:07] <starsinmypockets> Brodingo that'swhat I was looking for thankyou~!
[08:54:12] <whallz> but enver once
[08:54:17] <whallz> can anybody help?
[08:54:29] <jQuerier123> where would I read on objects/ can you answer my question
[08:54:59] <Brodingo> whallz post some code -> receive help
[08:55:21] <Brodingo> ?101 @ jQuerier123
[08:55:22] <bot-t> jQuerier123, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[08:56:01] <whallz> Brodingo: http://pastebin.com/5mzqYWU2
[08:56:09] <whallz> am i missing something?
[08:57:06] <quicksilver> every time keyup is called in js-search-input, you are binding *another* keyup handler to $(window)
[08:57:18] <quicksilver> after a few keypresses, $(window) will have many many keyup handlers.
[08:57:27] <Blazento> if i have a var such as el_name       = $(event.target).attr('name').... The result will be "content", how come i can do @options.model.set "content": value, but not @options.model.set el_name: value (this might be syntactically different due to coffeescript)
[08:57:53] <ris> jesus the jqueryui date selctor widget is badly written
[08:57:57] <jQuerier123> I'll post some code to help ask my question
[08:58:04] <whallz> quicksilver: ok, how do i prevent that?
[08:58:08] <zoned> anyone ever battled jquery's 'Node was not found" code: "8' before?
[08:58:28] <ris> i've lost about a week to it already
[08:58:40] <starsinmypockets> Anyone mind telling me what's wrong with this: $(a).hover(function () {alert("Hello World");)}
[08:58:53] <ajpiano> starsinmypockets: $("a")
[08:59:07] <zoned> currently i wrap my method in a try/catch, catch that exception and call that method again (because whenever it happens, it will always work the next time) not sure why..
[08:59:07] <ajpiano> ris: yeah it's antique :///

[09:00:26] <MoTiOnXml> good stuff with 1.6.3 everybody
[09:00:37] <MoTiOnXml> looking forward to using it
[09:00:37] <ajpiano> ris: we're rewriting it from scratch for jquery ui

[09:01:09] <starsinmypockets> I'm new to js thanks for a leg up
[09:01:27] <ris> ajpiano: the parsing function seems to be the only bit worth keeping
[09:01:33] <ris> because theyre always ugly
[09:01:34] <ajpiano> starsinmypockets: you need to a) have it in a document ready block and b) write syntactically valid javascript

[09:04:46] <jQuerier123> could someone help me
[09:05:18] <xp_prg> it just says undefined
[09:05:30] <xp_prg> when I do alert($("a").attr("gallery_name"));
[09:06:06] <Brodingo> xp_prg you should use data-gallery-name
[09:06:22] <Brodingo> and then $('a').data('gallery-name')
[09:06:28] <jQuerier123> hello
[09:07:25] <jQuerier123> someone please help me.
[09:07:51] <Brodingo> jQuerier123 i dont think you can use a variable like that to name an object key
[09:08:45] <jQuerier123> i don't get what your saying, I just want to know which one is the js var and the php var
[09:09:13] <Brodingo> what the

[09:10:36] <jQuerier123> I will I did so ha
[09:10:43] <Brodingo> ...
[09:10:52] <gf3> jQuerier123: yes and your fiddle doesn't work

[09:12:31] <jQuerier123> I know
[09:12:37] <ajpiano> gf3:  how do i connect the php tube to the javascript tube
[09:12:45] <madsara> Anyone seen an issue where when you create a dialog() (say off #user_info), each time you do so it adds a new #user_info div id to the document?
[09:12:50] <gf3> ajpiano: very carefully
[09:13:01] <Brodingo> how do i fit the square peg in the round hole
[09:13:11] <ajpiano> Brodingo: see gf3's advice
[09:13:17] <Brodingo> oic

[09:13:57] <jQuerier123> who can help me
[09:13:58] <jQuerier123> understand
[09:14:09] <ajpiano> jQuerier123: php variables don't just magically become available in javascript
[09:14:16] <ajpiano> unless you are generating the js inside of php
[09:14:30] <jQuerier123> thats not what I mean
[09:14:34] <Brodingo> ?g what dont you fucking understand
[09:14:35] <bot-t> Brodingo, Christian Bale Out Video "What don't you f*cking understand?" (R ... - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUjcSKaBfL8
[09:14:45] <ajpiano> jQuerier123: what do you mean
[09:15:13] <Brodingo> wow that is dumb
[09:16:03] <jQuerier123> so you have { } and inside there you have the variable that you declared above and another one, right.
[09:16:18] <ajpiano> ... ok
[09:16:18] <jQuerier123> which one is the one you declared before
[09:16:48] * ajpiano head asplode
[09:17:00] <gf3> jQuerier123: I showed you how to use a variable as an object key
[09:17:28] <gf3> ?eval var dicks = {}, pee = "poo"; dicks[pee] = "lol"; dicks // @ jQuerier123
[09:17:28] <bot-t> jQuerier123: {"poo": "lol"}
[09:17:35] <jQuerier123> that was a little too much too comprehend
[09:17:38] <gf3> jQuerier123: notice there is no "pee" in the final object
[09:17:46] <jQuerier123> lol
[09:17:48] <gf3> only "poo" and "lol"
[09:18:52] <Brodingo> ?eval var <?php print 'fname' ?> = {}, pee = "poo"; dicks[pee] = "lol"; fname
[09:18:53] <bot-t> Brodingo: SyntaxError: missing variable name
[09:18:56] <Brodingo> WHAT THE FUCK
[09:19:22] <jQuerier123> WTF I still son't understand
[09:19:41] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/rmJw8/  -- what the hell am i doing wrong?? when a productid is not selected, the IF() statement thinks it is selected
[09:20:17] <Asone> O.o
[09:20:52] <Brodingo> swiggy first of all dont use attr for style, use css, second of all dont use css, use add/remove class
[09:21:08] <Brodingo> swiggy also you should cache $('#productid')
[09:21:12] <thisbetom> How do you explain the "$('h2 a', listing)" of this line in a comment/psuedocode? $('.result').each(function(listing) {console.log($('h2 a', listing).attribs.href)}
[09:21:12] <jQuerier123> someone please f***ing help me
[09:21:16] <ajpiano> swiggy, a select multiple doesn't return a string.  it either returns null or an an array of values
[09:21:21] <ajpiano> jQuerier123: calm down
[09:21:25] <Brodingo> jQuerier123 nobody know what your problem is
[09:21:34] <swiggy> ah
[09:21:35] <thisbetom> ajpiano: ohai!
[09:21:39] <jQuerier123> I tried explaining it
[09:21:39] <swiggy> so whats the solution? check length?
[09:21:44] <ajpiano> omg thisbetom wasssssuppp
[09:22:04] <ajpiano> swiggy: you can just do if ( $("#whatevers").val() ) { }
[09:22:13] <ajpiano> cause null is falsy and array is truth
[09:22:25] <ajpiano> y*
[09:22:30] <jQuerier123> Should I continue to explain it
[09:22:45] <swiggy> <thisbetom> ajpiano: ohai!

[09:22:50] <Brodingo> jQuerier123 yes but be sure not to include any php in your javascript

I wonder why the getJSON function wouldn't give back the IP address since the alert() call returns "undefined" plus in the $.ajax() call the "data:" parameter should pass to the php those values but in the php I don't get any value why?.... thanks in advance to all :))))
[09:26:35] <SlexAxton> tom, the second param is a root node
[09:26:40] <SlexAxton> so that would be the same as
[09:26:51] <SlexAxton> $(listing).find('h2 a')
[09:27:00] <jQuerier123> thought you were going to help
[09:27:01] <SlexAxton> it literally gets turned into that in the internal code
[09:27:02] <thisbetom> $(".result h2 a")
[09:27:13] <jedimind> hey, i have a $.post im doing, and getting a {json:object, something:else} returned to me, how do i use it as an actual aray/json object with javascript considering i am doing function(data); i want to do data.json data.something
[09:27:15] <thisbetom> SlexAxton: <3z
[09:27:16] <jedimind> wow
[09:27:28] <jedimind> i hope that makes sense to someone my brain doesnt feel like cooperating at the moment
[09:27:33] <jQuerier123> I thought you were going to help me @ajpiano
[09:27:44] <SlexAxton> jedimind: make it have those properties
[09:28:01] <SlexAxton> { json: x, something: y }
[09:28:03] <jedimind> it does, the return does have those properties but i cant seem to use them
[09:28:14] <jedimind> i thought it would all be automagic as well but it's not
[09:28:16] <SlexAxton> pastebin the return
[09:28:25] <jedimind> yupp one sec, i'll pastebin the whole thign
[09:28:27] <SlexAxton> it is automagic, you're probably just missing something
[09:28:40] <jQuerier123> so can someone help me
[09:29:08] <Brodingo> jQuerier123 data: fname
[09:29:32] <jQuerier123> so data is the thing I'm "posting" to php
[09:29:38] <jedimind> SlexAxton, http://pastebin.com/BXEHKppY
[09:29:59] <Brodingo> jQuerier123 yes but youll probably want to use .submit() not .click()
[09:30:19] <jQuerier123> Could I ask the difference
[09:30:37] <jQuerier123> because I have a button
[09:30:41] <Brodingo> submit is an event handler for form submissions
[09:30:43] <SlexAxton> jedimind: i must leave
[09:30:44] <SlexAxton> but
[09:30:45] <SlexAxton> {"status": "success","rel": "/signup/step"}
[09:30:52] <SlexAxton> that has no 'message' param
[09:30:54] <jedimind> jQuerier123, click is specific to the submit button being clicke,d where as submit will work on the basis of the formb eing submitted by other means as well (ie if they hit enter)
[09:30:56] <SlexAxton> and it seems to be working
[09:30:58] <SlexAxton> anyways
[09:30:59] <SlexAxton> im out.
[09:30:59] <jedimind> SlexAxton, message is optional
[09:31:10] <jQuerier123> oh ok thanks
[09:31:28] <Brodingo> i assume #fname is a form
[09:31:41] <jQuerier123> no
[09:32:09] <Brodingo> oh, well then stick with the click
[09:32:13] <jQuerier123> oh ok I see how submit works,
[09:32:33] <jQuerier123> fname is an input field
[09:33:03] <jQuerier123> I finally got my question answered, what  a waste of time this chat room was,is there a complaint form
[09:33:18] <Brodingo> yeah right here ----> fuck off

[09:35:18] <littulb> does that not set that functions name as well??
[09:35:49] <Brodingo> what the

[09:36:48] <Brodingo> so youre wanting to declare a global?
[09:40:16] <Lurzino> Brodingo you're right.... I definately gotta fix the function!
[09:40:36] <Brodingo> Lurzino be sure to use callbacks when you get data from an async request
[09:41:44] <Brodingo> might take a little getting used to, but its the only way to be sure your data is getting passed correctly

[09:48:14] <jedimind> but i cant seem to get the data object to act accordingly as if it was a json object
[09:48:17] <Brodingo> swiggy $('#test').siblings().remove()
[09:48:30] <daevski> kborchers, do you have info on the headers bit also?
[09:48:37] <jedimind> http://pastebin.com/BXEHKppY
[09:48:46] <swiggy> try
[09:48:48] <swiggy> ty *
[09:49:09] <Brodingo> swiggy or $('#trtest').find('td').not('#test').remove()
[09:49:15] <kborchers> ?g php json header @ daevski
[09:49:16] <bot-t> daevski, PHP headers to serve JSON [php] [json] [header] - http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/5882
[09:49:32] <Brodingo> err i guess children() rather than find()
[09:49:51] <daevski> kborchers, you're good with that bot ;) thanks for your help
[09:49:57] <kborchers> np
[09:50:03] <Brodingo> .children(":not(#test)")
[09:56:50] <FunnyLookinHat> I have a div that isn't finishing it's slideDown() before slideUp() is supposed to be called on it - causing it to just end up showing no matter what... is there a way to make the slideUp() automatically wait for the slideDown() to finish if it's in a different function call ?
[09:58:38] <Brodingo> the queue should stack up by default i think
[09:59:08] <thefalling> why does this not work? Im still confused about scope within jquery, I was thinking that $(this) would be in the scope of the a element found, but I guess not.table.children().find("a").replaceWith($(this).val());
[09:59:13] <FunnyLookinHat> Brodingo, they would if it was the same chain, but they're different
[09:59:31] <Brodingo> FunnyLookinHat well you can check is(":animated")
[09:59:40] <FunnyLookinHat> oh duh
[09:59:41] <FunnyLookinHat> thanks :D
[10:00:24] <Brodingo> thefalling maybe inside a function
[10:00:47] <thefalling> ok so if i used an anonymous function, it would be within the a elements scope?
[10:02:01] <Brodingo> thefalling yessir
[10:02:53] <thefalling> table.children().find("a").replaceWith(function(){ return $(this).val() }); That didnt seem to work, syntax look right?
[10:04:41] <Brodingo> val is for inputs
[10:06:03] <starsinmypockets> Can anyone recommend a basic modal window plugin that I can display using hover() ?
[10:07:01] <thefalling> oh lol yeah that could be the issue
[10:08:02] <Brodingo> starsinmypockets modal on hover sounds annoying, or are you talking about a tooltip?
[10:08:44] <ravenzz> thedeeno1 http://jsfiddle.net/dSnY5/
[10:08:48] <ravenzz> lul
[10:08:51] <ravenzz> thefalling http://jsfiddle.net/dSnY5/
[10:09:09] <starsinmypockets> Brodingo - simillar to netflix or this http://www.soundstagedirect.com/blues-vinyl-records.shtml
[10:09:57] <Brodingo> yeah thats more of a tooltip thing
[10:10:12] <Brodingo> id say just roll your own, wouldnt take but a few line of code
[10:10:46] <ravenzz> starsinmypockets http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/#popovers
[10:11:02] <ravenzz> basically if you don't need effects you can display it by css
[10:13:03] <daevski> kborchers, still here? Do you have a suggestion for passing several json objects with php? I'm querying users and listing them with ajax.
[10:13:44] <ravenzz> daevski nested arrays?
[10:13:44] <kborchers> daevski: just wrap them all inside one big object
[10:14:47] <Agent_137> if i call the click method on a link, and then try to change the href in that link to something else, what happens when the click method is done executing? Do i go to the original href or the modified one?
[10:15:05] <daevski> kborchers, then how would I loop through and/or parse them to set them in their own div?
[10:15:20] <kborchers> daevski: nested loops
[10:16:04] <daevski> kborchers, can you pastebin a simple example of what the nested loops would look like?
[10:16:17] <ravenzz> Agent_137 "original"
[10:16:35] <daevski> kborchers, this is my first time attempting this feat.
[10:18:06] <kborchers> daevski: it's simple, you would just do an each which would then give you each "interior" object, then you would do another each on "this" and you would be looping through that object
[10:18:46] <daevski> kborchers, oh I see. Okay thanks. I'm going work on that :)
[10:19:08] <Agent_137> thanks ravenzz. so if i want to go to the modified link, would preventdefault and then window.location = myModifiedHref be the best way?
[10:21:00] <starsinmypockets> davenzz - this is just a css file? How do I implement this with a hover?
[10:21:30] <ravenzz> Agent_137 mh no wait, maybe i am wrong http://jsfiddle.net/HzAwv/1/
[10:21:30] <daevski> kborchers, var obj = $.parseJSON(msg); -- wouldn't I have issues with using obj.name then? Cause all the 'internal' objects each have a obj.name
[10:23:04] <ravenzz> starsinmypockets rip the css and the markup from there, and then $('.modal').hover(function() { $(this).toggle() });
[10:23:05] <ravenzz> ?
[10:23:54] <starsinmypockets> thanks ravenzz
[10:24:09] <Agent_137> thanks ravenzz. i'll jsfiddle w/ it from here.
[10:24:12] <kborchers> daevski: you wouldn't do obj.name once you're in your loops, it would this.name
[10:24:26] <ravenzz> even though i think that it is a bad idea to use hover oh the .modal container
[10:24:41] <daevski> kborchers, bingo. Okay thanks :)
[10:24:44] <ravenzz> i mean it make no sense
[10:24:46] <ravenzz> sorry
[10:25:34] <ravenzz> starsinmypockets $('.thumbnail').hover(function() { $(this).parent().find('.modal').toggle() }); supposing that .thumnail and .modal are sibilings
[10:25:55] <zoned> i have a form, when you click a radio button it populates a div below the form with an appropriate image, title, and description of the selection you just made. i'm trying to find a way to fade or somehow transition between this so it looks nicer. currently, i just empty out the div, and start appending the new elements. anyone have any ideas?
[10:26:51] <ravenzz> starsinmypockets also i would go for mouseenter/mouse out instead of hover()
[10:27:07] <starsinmypockets> ravenzz - why?
[10:27:15] <starsinmypockets> clarity?
[10:27:57] <ravenzz> starsinmypockets otherwise any time your mouse will move over the .thumbnail the hover() function will be executed
[10:28:17] <starsinmypockets> ravenzz - is that what causes the flicker?
[10:28:30] <ravenzz> yes
[10:28:35] <ravenzz> tons of hide/show
[10:28:40] <starsinmypockets> ravenzz - ok cool
[10:30:21] <austinbv> ajpiano: just incase you want to know http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/wzve6/6/ $.ajax handles jsop errors since 1.04
[10:31:10] <daevski> kborchers, if I understood correctly... http://pastebin.com/mRx1bZ4B -- but I'm just getting long list of undefined.
[10:31:27] <ajpiano> austinbv: if does, it's a happy accident and not cross browser
[10:31:59] <austinbv> works in chrome and safari
[10:32:20] <austinbv> i will fire up firefox
[10:32:26] <ajpiano> austinbv: opera is the one that was super weird iirc
[10:32:31] <ajpiano> but not sure about ie either
[10:32:44] <austinbv> opera can go hang out in a broken world
[10:32:46] <onekey> Hello all, i am trying to use the load() function to put some HTML from a other file into a div. This is the test code i using: http://pastebin.com/YdnWuUvZ - i get the alert that the load was performed, but the divs content does not change (it stays "hi") - any idea what i am doing wrong?
[10:32:58] <kborchers> daevski: i guess it would depend on what your json looks like. i would start putting in console.logs outside and inside those each's to see what i'm getting to make sure it's what you expect
[10:34:08] <austinbv> ajpiano: sorry linked the wrong fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/austinbv/wzve6/11/
[10:35:13] <austinbv> if you break the url you will see the fail called I wish I had a pc to test on
[10:35:55] <Lurzino> Brodingo, here http://pastebin.com/sn8kBufU I have fixed the first part about the getting IP but when I call mlf.php through the second ajax call I see it doesn't pass the data: values... why?
[10:36:33] <ravenzz> austinbv it works
[10:37:01] <ravenzz> but you are missing var
[10:37:09] <daevski> kborchers, http://imagebin.org/170704
[10:37:14] <ravenzz> on ie is mandatory
[10:37:39] <austinbv> coffeescript handels that for me
[10:37:46] <ravenzz> austinbv http://jsfiddle.net/wzve6/12/
[10:38:01] <ravenzz> this one works on ie
[10:38:31] <austinbv> ravenzz: will you break the url and try in IE
[10:38:49] <austinbv> all you did was add var url?
[10:38:53] <Brodingo> Lurzino not sure man, is there a reason youre using async false?
[10:40:35] <ravenzz> austinbv yep it fail if i break the url
[10:40:40] <austinbv> awesome
[10:41:05] <ravenzz> austinbv var get_each_total_broken = function(callback) {
[10:41:10] <ravenzz> ^
[10:41:30] <kborchers> daevski: that looks like you would only need one each. then you would do this.f_name etc.
[10:42:03] <ravenzz> austinbv but look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/wzve6/13/
[10:42:10] <daevski> kborchers, alrighty brb making eggs.
[10:42:29] <ravenzz> austinbv i replaced search.js with sex.js
[10:42:33] <austinbv> oh weird
[10:42:35] <austinbv> i saw
[10:43:11] <austinbv> sex.js doesnt ever 404
[10:43:37] <austinbv> oh it returs a 400
[10:43:44] <Lurzino> Brodingo.... solved! I used $_GET in the php when in the $.ajax call I settled as type POST.... that means I'm dumb haha
[10:43:44] <Lurzino> :D
[10:43:57] <Kenaniah_work> hi all. Anyone try storing a google map object in data()?
[10:44:07] <Kenaniah_work> trying to retrieve it, I get weird results
[10:44:08] <ravenzz> bad request wtf?
[10:44:12] <austinbv> ravenzz: put it in your browser you will see it responds
[10:44:15] <austinbv> thats annoying
[10:44:32] <ravenzz> yes
[10:44:35] <ravenzz> i saw
[10:44:41] <daevski> kborchers, still undefined taking out the $.each(this) one
[10:45:15] <ravenzz> austinbv just add some checks inside the success function
[10:45:22] <kborchers> daevski: can you fiddle a simplified example and just put the data in a var so i can play with it?
[10:45:28] <austinbv> yup
[10:45:39] <onekey> Can someone tell me why the load() is not putting stuff in to the content div? http://jsfiddle.net/dmNVX/11/
[10:45:44] <daevski> kborchers, but only 4 undefined this time. Yeah I think i can. give me a few mins
[10:46:50] <daevski> kborchers, nope, I lied to you. I works well. one more bug, but I need to eat first. I get the names correctly now. brb
[10:46:56] <Kenaniah_work> onekey: that's a regexp
[10:47:02] <Kenaniah_work> onekey: you need to but strings in quotes
[10:47:17] <Kenaniah_work> *put
[10:47:17] <svdv> is there a way to complete html dynamically replacing a placeholder somewhere in the html?
[10:47:45] <onekey> Kenaniah_work, thanks but with quotes its still not working http://jsfiddle.net/dmNVX/13/
[10:48:14] <Kenaniah_work> onekey: it makes sense that it's not going to load in the fiddle
[10:48:28] <Kenaniah_work> onekey: you gave it a relative path, which means it's going to try to load from jsfiddle.net
[10:48:43] <Kenaniah_work> onekey: maybe if you plugged your domain in there, you might get somewhere
[10:48:46] <onekey> Kenaniah_work, fiddle has a echo api - it doe not work local eigther
[10:49:10] <austinbv> ravenzz: and they dont include a response status on a successful request
[10:49:11] <Kenaniah_work> onekey: that said, there's no content there
[10:49:17] <onekey> Kenaniah_work, (/echo/html should give you a echo for testing)
[10:49:22] <austinbv> the only thing I am worried about are 500's though
[10:49:24] <Kenaniah_work> onekey: i get a blank page
[10:49:59] <Kenaniah_work> onekey: seriously, try a different URL. The echo api is down
[10:50:08] <Fodoj> Hi all
[10:50:17] <onekey> Kenaniah_work, this is what i am using local http://pastebin.com/YdnWuUvZ (i get the message that the load was performed, however, the content of the div does not change)
[10:50:44] <onekey> Kenaniah_work,wow that pastebin code seems to work in firefox.... but not in chrome??
[10:50:45] <Fodoj> Is there any way to find element by class name, if class name is string variable, except using $('.'+className) ?
[10:51:45] <Kenaniah_work> Fodoj: document.getElementsByClassName()
[10:52:05] <m1chael> im trying to use django-selectable : i've got it working, but i had to put in DOMREADY JQuery code. http://mal.icuinternet.com # anyone know why this is?
[10:52:26] <m1chael> the django-selectable code never mentions this
[10:52:37] <daevski> kborchers, really appreciate the patience. I works very well now.
[10:52:45] <kborchers> glad to help
[10:52:55] <onekey> Kenaniah_work, ok just tested this. it works in IE and firefox but not in chrome, wow thats weird
[10:53:43] <Fodoj> Kenaniah_work: i wrote following code: http://pastie.org/2472191 Is it the best way of finding by class name if name is variable?
[10:54:51] <Kenaniah_work> Fodoj: honestly, I'd rather do $("."+options['contentClass]).hide()
[10:55:05] <Kenaniah_work> Fodoj: err, $("."+options['contentClass']).hide()
[10:55:44] <Fodoj> Kenaniah_work: i like it better too, though it looks a little bit ugly :) Thx for help!

[11:08:06] <sphinxxx> how can i call a function at set intervals? (or what is the most efficient way to do this)
[11:08:36] <Brodingo> a recursive setTimeout
[11:09:20] <sphinxxx> brodingo, could you show me an example?
[11:09:35] <Brodingo> var foo = setTimeout(function(){foo();}, 200)
[11:09:52] <snover> uh
[11:09:52] <snover> wut
[11:09:57] <snover> try again brodingo :D
[11:10:29] <Brodingo> ; foo()
[11:10:34] <Brodingo> what
[11:10:46] <jdevel> can you not set the width of an element created by the shorthand jquery before it's added to the DOM?  such as, var d = $('<div>'); d.width(200); alert(d.width()); ?
[11:11:19] <sphinxxx> but how is that recursive?
[11:11:20] <snover> Brodingo: think, man. what value does setTimeout return?
[11:11:21] <jdevel> I get zero
[11:11:45] <sphinxxx> that looks like it would just call foo function after 200ms, and then be done with it, no?
[11:12:04] <snover> function lol() { setTimeout(lol, 200); } lol();
[11:12:09] <Brodingo> hehe
[11:12:17] <Brodingo> i dun goofd
[11:12:28] <Brodingo> thats more like it!
[11:13:14] <sphinxxx> wouldn't it be     function lol() { setTimeout(function(){lol();}, 200); }
[11:13:21] <jdevel> recursive is a function that calls it's self
[11:13:49] <Brodingo> no parens in the setTimeout args
[11:13:57] <Brodingo> wait

[11:14:22] <Guest41833> can someone tell me why i can't access the text() function on the elements in the cells array? http://pastebin.com/iQgPgHMd
[11:14:43] <kborchers> sphinxxx: your way would also work but why not save bytes and pass the function by ref like in snover's. you don't have to use an anonymous function in setTimeout
[11:17:36] <Guest41833> can you run jquery functions on the elements returned in the array created by .toArray()?
[11:20:01] <danzik17> Guest41833: No.  That returns a normal array which will have none of the jQuery functions on it
[11:21:01] <Guest41833> danzik17: what would be the optimal way to select rows in a table for updating?
[11:21:34] <Guest41833> i'm trying to avoid running selectors every loop and just cache the cell objects
[11:21:41] <Guest41833> is there any benefit of doing that?
[11:22:28] <danzik17> Guest41833: Quite a big benefit, but your code is running that selector every iteration of your loop as you have it written
[11:23:33] <Germanaz0> hello everybody
[11:23:49] <Guest41833> right, what would be the best way to create the array of objects? foreach? (i'm going to move the selector to an init function)
[11:23:51] <Germanaz0> I would like to know how to force the browser to a specific timezone
[11:25:53] <danzik17> Guest41833: Without seeing your data at all, I'm guessing you want to see ?map
[11:25:53] <bot-t> Guest41833, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/

[11:38:42] <Guest41833> what am i doing wrong?
[11:38:51] <svdv> i'm trying to use replaceWith , to replace a placeholder with <td>contents1</td> <td>contents2</td>
[11:39:10] <svdv> can anyone help?
[11:39:13] <ajpiano> Guest41833: that's how map works (as well as each)... the elem is a dom elem, not a jquery object
[11:39:16] <ajpiano> $(this).text()
[11:39:30] <BillCriswell> heh, genius: http://i.imgur.com/lHvzz.png
[11:39:52] <ajpiano> Guest41833: $(cell).text() as well
[11:40:11] <svdv> BillCriswell, why?
[11:40:25] <ajpiano> cause the fields are laid out like an actual credit card!!!
[11:40:25] <Guest41833> ajpiano danzik17 thanks! that worked :)
[11:40:26] <BillCriswell> svdv: I never seen it done like that before and it makes so much sense.
[11:40:57] <svdv> BillCriswell, you mean the placing of the input fields?
[11:41:03] <BillCriswell> svdv: Yes.
[11:41:10] <svdv> ok
[11:41:22] <BillCriswell> svdv: Doesn't take much to impress me as you can tell.
[11:42:36] <tfitts> is there a way to cancel pending jsonp requests when you fire the next one?
[11:43:10] <tfitts> svdv: and what are you having trouble with on the replacewith?
[11:43:50] <svdv> i'm using $("p").replaceWith( "foo1</td><td>foo2" );
[11:44:08] <svdv> tfitts, and the html code is <td><p></p></td>
[11:44:19] <danzik17> tfitts: You can call .abort() on the previous call's promise if you save a reference to it
[11:44:30] <svdv> tfitts, results in <td>foo2</td>
[11:44:40] <tfitts> danzik17: does that actually cancel the request or just discard the results?
[11:45:33] <redfox19> hi, is possible to write a value in a table's cell that is defined with tag eg. <td nome="valoreMed_5">
[11:45:37] <Germanaz0> is there some way to force the browser to take a custom timezone
[11:45:41] <Germanaz0> with JS
[11:45:50] <Guest41833> so i can map $(this) or $(cell) to an array in an init function to reduce selector use?
[11:46:02] <Germanaz0> because if my CPU clock is configured with some hour and I have confnigured in the server another timezone
[11:46:25] <Germanaz0> then a calendar maden with js will display me the time of the CPU clock instead the server time
[11:46:48] <tfitts> svdv: have you tried a more specific selector?  like giving it an ID just to test it?
[11:47:14] <Isis___> Hello ya all, a simple question , if I have first div 500px height and another div under it. if i .hide() the first...shouldnt the second go to the top of the screen??
[11:48:23] <BillCriswell> Isis___: You bet.
[11:48:30] <tfitts> redfox19: you want to write a value in addition to what is there or just overwite it's contents with whatever value
[11:48:39] <redfox19> overwrite
[11:48:59] <danzik17> tfitts: Not positive.  Trying $.ajax({ url: 'http://www.digg.com', type: 'GET', dataType: 'jsonp'}).abort() and watching Fiddler, you still get results (they're just ignored)
[11:49:00] <svdv> tfitts, yes same thing
[11:49:06] <Isis___> BillCriswell: mine doestn, second div stays in the middle of the screen
[11:49:27] <BillCriswell> Isis___:  Do you have any styling on it?
[11:49:31] <tfitts> svdv: is it online?  I'd like to look at it.
[11:49:46] <svdv> tfitts, no :/
[11:50:16] <tfitts> redfox19: if you give it an id of valoreMed_5 you would do $('#valoreMed_5').html('New Value');
[11:50:31] <Isis___> BillCriswell: only the display none
[11:50:38] <BillCriswell> i mean on the one below it
[11:50:47] <redfox19> THANX A LOT ;)
[11:51:04] <redfox19> is late to programming ... all simple things seems so difficult :)
[11:51:17] <Isis___> BillCriswell: no, nothing
[11:53:24] <BillCriswell> Isis___:  There has to be something else there. Here goes some example code. http://jsfiddle.net/urpkv/
[11:53:50] <Isis___> thanks
[11:53:51] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/urpkv/1/ illustrates it better.
[11:54:30] <svdv> tfitts, http://jsfiddle.net/9ddqj/
[11:57:29] <tfitts> svdv: is this just to test a concept? would it work to replace the td instead?
[11:57:43] <tfitts> or to change the html of that td?
[11:58:16] <martco> how do i make words that turn into tags
[11:58:27] <Germanaz0> -_-'
[11:59:00] <martco> i just need a keyword to search on google
[11:59:09] <martco> i'm not as noobish as i sound lol
[11:59:27] <martco> the words that turns into a bubble after typing a commma
[11:59:47] <svdv> tfitts, i actually want to create two additional custom <td> , so i'm using one to create the other one
[11:59:50] <martco> encapsulated in a div
[12:00:23] <martco> please help, thanks!
[12:01:55] <svdv> tfitts, but yes it would fit, if it changes anything to achieve that
[12:02:47] <tfitts> well, if you want to add 2 cells to a row you can give the tr for that row an ID and then append the cells
[12:02:52] <tfitts> http://jsfiddle.net/9ddqj/3/
[12:04:26] <tfitts> svdv: http://jsfiddle.net/9ddqj/3/
[12:05:11] <svdv> tfitts, shouldnt it be bar1 bar2 7 on tha last line the way you wrote it?
[12:05:36] <redfox19> if I want to chage the value of a table cell, label with id=""bla" ... How I can? eg. with parameter, from an array (name of cell and value)
[12:06:07] <hifi> hi, can I somehow force jquery ui to start resizing an element starting from current cursor position? any workaround appreciated
[12:06:16] <hifi> using .resizable() naturally
[12:06:56] <hifi> .trigger('resizestart') on the container or .trigger('mousedown') on the handle didn't do the trick
[12:08:06] <martco> i want to tagify a string after typing a comma
[12:08:16] <Bazo0> i have a problem...im using ajax with load() function but the http requests sometimes duplicated...any solution for ajax requests redundancy ?
[12:08:17] <martco> and then so on for the next
[12:08:27] <martco> so i have a inline list of tags
[12:08:30] <martco> how do i do that?
[12:08:45] <martco> i just the need the right words to search...
[12:08:51] <martco> if anyone can help, thanks
[12:11:20] <MadZappaFan2> Is this an okay place to ask jQ mobile questions? I haven't seen a channel specifically for mobile.
[12:11:44] <dexter_e> is it possible to get a list of all #ids in a given div
[12:12:05] <dexter_e> or is it possible to get an array of all #ids and .classes in a given div
[12:13:50] <MadZappaFan2> dexer, found this on stackoverflow: "You can use document.getElementById('#divId').className.split(/\s+/); to get you an array of class names."
[12:14:25] <MadZappaFan2> here's the link. they also have an example to itereate through the list of classes you get back
[12:14:27] <MadZappaFan2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1227286/get-class-list-for-element-with-jquery
[12:16:02] <MadZappaFan2> Can anyone help with getting an onchange event to work with a jQ Mobile slider?
[12:16:33] <MadZappaFan2> i've added data-change="calculateTicketPrices" to the range type field, but the function is not getting called.
[12:19:29] <martco> tagify]
[12:19:31] <martco> found it myself
[12:19:36] <martco> thanks for nothing, jquery
[12:20:40] <Bazo0> stupid support
[12:27:11] <tfitts> svdv: no, because it appends it
[12:27:22] <tfitts> if you you did prepend it would be bar1 bar2 7
[12:29:28] <svdv> tfitts, ok, how can i hide it? the same <tr>
[12:29:44] <tfitts> $('#append').hide();
[12:30:24] <hifi> hm, this seems to be rather tricky
[12:31:09] <hifi> in general how do I trigger a UI widget event?
[12:31:27] <hifi> it's all about calling the right stuff now
[12:31:33] <ajpiano> hifi: this._trigger("eventname", eventObj, uiObj);
[12:31:41] <svdv> tfitts, thanks!
[12:31:44] <tfitts> np
[12:31:47] <hifi> ajpiano: from outside it's scope?
[12:32:03] <ajpiano> .trigger("widgetnameeventname"
[12:32:30] <ajpiano> you won't nec. have the right event and ui obj parms tht you're expecting
[12:32:45] <hifi> ajpiano: I'm trying to start resize event on mousedown
[12:33:07] <hifi> mousedown on a different element than .resizable
[12:33:23] <ajpiano> that is probably a lot trickier :/
[12:33:29] <hifi> damn
[12:33:40] <hifi> wanted to "draw" an element
[12:33:54] <hifi> mousedown -> create .resizable() -> start resize
[12:34:05] <ajpiano> oh wait
[12:34:10] <ajpiano> there's def a demo of that somewhere
[12:34:16] <cbeck_> anyone got a tip for tracking down dependencies that dissapear after the DOMReady funciton fires?
[12:34:57] <cbeck_> i.e using knockout.js depends on jquery.tmpl which is there until the DOMReady function fires, then jQuery.tmpl isnt there anymore
[12:34:58] <hifi> ajpiano: making that without .resizable is a breeze in itself but did that demo use .resizable?
[12:35:07] <ajpiano> yea using resizable
[12:35:10] <hifi> ah, cool
[12:35:11] <starsinmypockets> Apologies - I'm rather new to this, but I'm trying to do an ajax call with .load(); I can load a file from within the web root, but trying to call content via https://... fails..
[12:35:13] <hifi> thats what I'm after
[12:35:21] <ajpiano> cbeck_: are you sure you aren't ajaxing in some page that is reloading and consequently blowing away jquery
[12:35:44] <cbeck_> not using ajax to bring in any markup at all, just json data
[12:36:22] <ajpiano> hmm
[12:36:22] <ajpiano> that's the telltale symptom of that particular issue
[12:37:00] <ajpiano> hifi: it's actually done on top of selectable
[12:37:01] <ajpiano> http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-en/browse_thread/thread/9158d61a96061873
[12:37:06] <ajpiano> i can't get to jsbin from this bloody train wifi
[12:37:51] <hifi> though apparently that uses it's own ui.boxer plugin to do that
[12:39:23] <hifi> I don't really need that as everything is already there except passing the action to .resizable
[12:39:49] <ajpiano> hifi:  all these things really are just building ontop of ui mouse
[12:39:50] <JAAulde> Has anyone here ever had IE lose track of the fact that an object is an instance of something in particular? Although I am unable to reproduce it in a test case, I have a place in my code where I pass an object (instance built from some code I wrote) to a UI widget as an option. Inside of the _create() function of the widget, instanceof returns false for this object against the function I built it from.
[12:40:07] <JAAulde> I am also losing prototype override functions such as my custom to_string()
[12:40:24] <hifi> ajpiano: but can I emulate that event to resizable from outside everything?
[12:40:28] <JAAulde> s/to_string()/toString()/
[12:40:32] <ajpiano> hifi: i'm not entirely sure
[12:40:52] <hifi> also just FYI it's a bit broken that .resizable() uses negative absolutes to position handles
[12:41:07] <ajpiano> hifi: we know a lot is broken about interactions
[12:41:10] <hifi> firefox adds that to the parent element size
[12:41:46] <hifi> in my case it was enough to use zero positions instead as the handles can be inside on top of the element borders
[12:41:57] <hifi> chrome handled that well though
[12:42:19] <cbeck_> ajpiano: think i may have found itâ¦ another included set of scripts buried grrr remove them and it doesnt disappear
[12:44:31] <hifi> ajpiano: I can live with the boxer plugin, just that it doesn't have any license applied to it :/
[12:45:13] <hifi> ajpiano: thanks for the tip
[12:45:23] <ajpiano> hifi: it's an ad hoc thing that richard threw together
[12:45:31] <ajpiano> i'm sure he'd be ok w/ it
[12:46:49] <JAAulde> ajpiano: what does UI doe with options passed to a widget which was built using the widget factory? Are they passed through $.extend() or something else, or both?
[12:46:59] <hifi> ajpiano: I might just make something a bit simpler for my use using the same ideology behind it - adding a jquery ui plugin that handles the initial box creation
[12:47:52] <ajpiano> JAAulde: they're stored on this.options
[12:47:53] <hifi> thank you and good night :)
[12:47:58] <ajpiano> hifi:  yea go for it
[12:48:00] <ajpiano> gnite!
[12:48:21] <JAAulde> ajpiano: right, but are they run through extend first in order to mesh with the defaults?
[12:49:15] <JAAulde> ajpiano: hmm, ok, outputted the toString() of the .fn function my widget produced
[12:49:20] <JAAulde> I see it extending it
[12:49:28] <ajpiano> JAAulde: yep
[12:49:53] <JAAulde> IE is, in some weird un-repeatable way, losing track of what one of my passed in options is
[12:50:21] <ajpiano> :///
[12:50:31] <JAAulde> It doesn't know it's an instance of that from which I made it, and it is losing prototype overrides I had on the object such as toString()
[12:51:47] <JAAulde> I wrote a reduced test case only to find it works as expected
[12:51:47] <JAAulde> lol
[12:52:50] <Isis___> hello everybody, i have a question , im trigging the window to print, but before that, i am trying to hide() some elements, they dont hide. When i test it without the line to print they do hide. any suggestion please?
[12:53:16] <JAAulde> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/JAAulde/MyRCw/5/
[12:53:45] <JAAulde> this works correctly, but in my failing code, the check for instanceof in _create() comes back false in IE
[12:54:33] <JAAulde> Isis___: I've done this successfully, so you'll have to show some code
[12:55:41] <ajpiano> JAAulde: im on the train doing a bunch of serious dev and sans IE
[12:55:53] <Isis___> JAAulde: what?
[12:56:24] <JAAulde> ajpiano: cool, no biggie. I stopped checking for instanceof and my code works.  Just wondered if anyone had run into such an oddity
[12:56:24] <ajpiano> JAAulde: i would maybe structure this differently though
[12:56:32] <JAAulde> yeah?
[12:57:02] <JAAulde> Isis___: what you say you want to accomplish, I have done successfully, so I know it is possible. so for us to trouble shoot your stuff, you need to show it to us
[12:57:18] <ajpiano> but it might be cause i'm just used to backbone now
[12:57:47] <ajpiano> JAAulde: you know widgets can extend from each other though
[12:57:47] <ajpiano> sooo
[12:58:00] <ajpiano> i probably would use that
[12:58:11] <JAAulde> ajpiano: I guess I didn't realize widgets could extend from each other
[12:58:14] <ajpiano> instead of like, having some base class and then manually extending stuff together
[12:58:16] <ajpiano> ah
[12:58:43] <JAAulde> problem is my base isn't really a base.  it's just some shared code. not a cmplete widget
[12:59:04] <JAAulde> will look at docs for widget extending
[12:59:09] <ajpiano> it doesn't have to be a complete widget
[12:59:16] <JAAulde> ah, ok
[12:59:36] <ajpiano> the ui mouse widget, for instance, is pretty much useless unless your'e extending something on top of it
[13:00:41] <JAAulde> ajpiano: I see.  This page doesn't mention extension http://docs.jquery.com/UI_Developer_Guide
[13:01:48] <ajpiano> yeah, my bad on that... we're working on redoing widget factory docs
[13:02:05] <JAAulde> Got ya
[13:02:11] <ajpiano> http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide7
[13:04:02] <JAAulde> ajpiano: hmm, ok. so any object oassed as param after the widget name is merged into one final "class"?
[13:04:44] <ajpiano> not exactly, can't do multiple extension
[13:05:36] <JAAulde> word
[13:05:39] <ajpiano> $.widget( "some.widget", $.some.thingtoinheritfrom, { ... });
[13:06:05] <JAAulde> ajpiano: sweet, got it. so i will make my base a widget (a useless one) and extend it for the other two
[13:06:30] <Isis___> JAAulde: im having something sort of this http://jsfiddle.net/s3n3n/3/
[13:06:32] <JAAulde> thanks, ajpiano
[13:06:51] <ajpiano> JAAulde: and then in 1.9 you have _super method for calling super methods
[13:07:08] <ajpiano> so that you don't have to do the verbose long call directly on the prototype
[13:07:34] <JAAulde> ok, so the only thing this saves right now is the manual call to extend
[13:07:42] <JAAulde> i still need my apply calls
[13:08:10] <gf3> Lol.prototype.super = Lol.prototype.constructor.prototype
[13:08:22] <gf3> dix
[13:19:25] <JAAulde> Isis___: the issue is that you're using animations on the show/hide stuff, so they're basically async. window.print() is able to run before they're done--and window.print() blocks, so you don't see anything until after it's done
[13:21:05] <JAAulde> Isis___: check this out: http://jsfiddle.net/s3n3n/8/
[13:21:17] <JAAulde> no animations, print view doesn't show interfase
[13:21:49] <Isis___> JAAulde: lets see
[13:22:42] <Isis___> JAAulde: coooool, that is just what i need it, thank you very much!!!
[13:23:33] <JAAulde> no problem
[13:24:27] <gf3> you could also use a print stylesheet
[13:24:47] <RalphSaunders> Is anyone able to shed some light on my problem? (see comments) http://pastie.org/2472840
[13:28:58] <starsinmypockets> If I'm using .load() to load a div on mouseenter() how can I then clear the div on mouseleave() ?
[13:29:20] <RalphSaunders> div.html( '' ) ?
[13:33:48] <sphinxxx> are there certain properties that are smoother to animate than others?
[13:33:54] <sphinxxx> like left vs marginleft , etc.
[13:51:16] <Nombrandue> ok, I am trying to get content from a form displayed in an IFRAME to populate as pure text into a DIV in the parent page, using the $.ajax function to control the actions of the submit button. Essentually the code posts to a form, and I want the response displayed in the DIV, not in the IFRAME
[13:53:06] <dalgard> okay. I just don't get this. if I need to insert html5 content (in <IE9), I should wrap it with innerShiv - but as I don't believe innerShiv regards which browser is used, wouldn't this mean a performance hit to those of my users who have a modern browser?
[13:53:47] <dalgard> how do people go around this?
[13:56:26] <dalgard> Nombrandue: you write your callback function so that it inserts the content in the parent frame's div...?
[13:57:43] <Nombrandue> I have been trying to figure that out, how best to do that. Unfortunately I am rather painfully new at Javascript in general
[13:59:04] <dalgard> well... I don't know if it's okay to say this, but I think you need to become better at javascript before doing "advanced" stuff.
[13:59:42] <dalgard> I mean, the jQuery idioms might give you some strange ideas about how the language works
[14:00:30] <luxigo> well when you learn advanced stuff you become "better"
[14:01:02] <dalgard> that's true. however ... what I said before
[14:02:06] <dalgard> anyway, to access the div in the parent frame you can do $(parent.document).find("#div")
[14:02:16] <tfitts> can someone help me out?  I have a form with a bunch of checkboxes, when I check one it fires a json call and updates the div with the form in it as well as another content block.  if I check another box after the form is replaced it works fine in firefox but it dies in IE
[14:03:07] <ajpiano> tfitts: go double check for completley valid markup
[14:03:23] <ajpiano> IE hates injecting malformed htmlz
[14:03:39] <tfitts> that's what I've been looking at, it's just hard as freak to debug something in IE
[14:03:50] <dalgard> tfitts: only one way to solve something like that - you need to reduce your code to isolate the error and then correct it. sometimes it takes a long time :)
[14:04:03] <sparuvu> how to refresh only the part of the page that was rendered using jQuery templates
[14:04:10] <sparuvu> is it even possible ?
[14:04:37] <dalgard> just gonna bump this....
[14:04:38] <dalgard> okay. I just don't get this. if I need to insert html5 content (in <IE9), I should wrap it with innerShiv - but as I don't believe innerShiv regards which browser is used, wouldn't this mean a performance hit to those of my users who have a modern browser?
[14:05:23] <dalgard> sparavu: what do you mean 'refresh'?
[14:07:41] <sparuvu> dalgard: I am rendering my page with templates. WHen the user edits sometihing and updates the data. I need to update the page and rendering it again. One way [dumb way] is tp refresh the page
[14:07:49] <sparuvu> what is the best way to do it ?
[14:09:38] <dalgard> sparuvu: are you talking about client-side jquery templates like microtemplates?
[14:10:02] <EyePulp> sparuvu: you can either mimic the edits using the DOM and query to make the changes, or use ajax to call back to the server and get changed portions of the pages, re-rendered on the server, and retrieve the html, and then swap it on the local page.
[14:10:14] <dalgard> +1
[14:10:27] <dalgard> <---
[14:11:04] <sparuvu> yes
[14:11:48] <Kenaniah_work> on deferred objects, are the callbacks called in the order added?
[14:11:50] <EyePulp> sparuvu: as for the "best" way, I'd just make sure I wasn't repeating the work if it can be helped.  e.g. always do it through jquery or always do it through the server
[14:12:11] <sparuvu> Dalgard : The problem is I need to do everything on the Client side.
[14:12:15] <EJFox> Hi- I'm trying to go through and find all the SVG paths in my document with a certain fill color, and then replace it with another color. Right now I am getting all of the elements fine, but once I have them in an array what is the best way to access them to change the attribute? You can see my example here (press Update) http://ejfox.com/colorschemer/ --  If you look at it in firebug, update adds fill=red to <html>
[14:12:37] <sparuvu> Now I have to make sure that the page always reflects the updated details
[14:12:37] <dalgard> sparuvu: again, what he said
[14:12:48] <sparuvu> without refreshing the page
[14:13:19] <dalgard> then you need to get the content from the server a-new.
[14:14:02] <dalgard> so, your scheme should probably be like this:
[14:14:22] <dalgard> when you originally load the page, get the content using ajax - then, after submitting the data, do the same thing again
[14:14:38] <sparuvu> I have been doing the same thing
[14:15:16] <dalgard> (that is, don't put the content on the page server-side in the first place - serve the page without the content, then get the content from the server using ajax. every time.)
[14:15:32] <sparuvu> but it is breaking some of the functionality like  some parts of the page which are hidden initialy [probably to display later] are not rendering
[14:15:48] <dalgard> (the advanced solution would be doing both depending on context, however.....)
[14:15:49] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[14:16:00] <ProLoser|Work> what's the proper syntax for adding methods to an object?
[14:16:05] <dalgard> sry, gotta go........
[14:17:04] <sparuvu> proloser: http://www.wait-till-i.com/2006/02/16/show-love-to-the-object-literal/
[14:17:05] <danzik17> Kenaniah_work: Yes
[14:17:08] <sparuvu> check that out
[14:24:05] <theKai> if i am loading plaintext data, is there anyway i can auto add '<p>[line]</p>' to each line, instead of replacing \n to <br /> ?
[14:25:17] <theKai> $(this).html ($(this).html().replace(/\n/g, "<br/>")); -- the original code, but this proved bad when the data has <ul> for example, it would just add <br /> to each new line
[14:26:40] <theKai> actually thinking about it even that wont solve it, since then it would add <p><ul>.. hm..
[14:27:38] <theKai> well if anyone got any ideas, what i am trying to do is format the text
[14:28:59] <mecode> I'm trying to figure out how to save the sort order of a list. There's the "sort" event for jquery ui, but I'm not sure how to then get data representing the sorted items.
[14:29:02] <Dave_Stein> theKai you should be using a view template it sounds like
[14:29:37] <Dave_Stein> theKai so var $item = $('#tempalte').tmpl({title:title});
[14:29:46] <theKai> i will check that out, thanks
[14:29:48] <Dave_Stein> theKai and then depending on the view it would wrap title with a <li> or <br />
[14:29:54] <theKai> thats perfect
[14:29:57] <theKai> thanks!
[14:30:10] <Dave_Stein> mecode: it looks at an attribute or something i forget
[14:30:22] <Dave_Stein> mecode: its in the docs how it gets the values to return as an array
[14:30:44] <Dave_Stein> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#method-toArray
[14:33:48] <jwmann> If I were to click on this blue highlighted link; In what way can I grab/select the link before it/ or after (light blue highlight)? http://d.pr/djDE
[14:34:19] <daevski> Anyone know why this code applies the .hovered and then removes it from one keypress? > http://pastebin.com/gLjDX8kB
[14:35:45] <daevski> I tried adding return false under them, and that didn't help either.
[14:39:21] <daevski> jwmann, you would just use .parent() or .parent('.className')
[14:40:36] <daevski> jwmann, so $('a').click(function(){ $(this).parent().hide() }) would make it disappear.
[14:40:58] <jwmann> daevski: Wow; Very nice. Thank you
[14:41:07] <daevski> jwmann, you're welcome
[14:41:46] <madprops> can anybody spot what's wrong here?         s = s + "<div onClick='$(this).css('color','blue');'>" + files[key] + "</div>";
[14:42:05] <ajpiano> the entire approach?
[14:42:10] <ajpiano> functions should be functions
[14:42:23] <ajpiano> not strings you dynamically concatenate together inside of an html string
[14:42:41] <daevski> madprops, I would get away from inline calls and do it in a .js file instead. I had a lot of trouble with that at first, so let me know if you need more explaination.
[14:44:16] <daevski> madprops, so don't ever use 'onClick' within your html, just write $('div#idName').click(function(){ //dosomething in here }) -- it will do the same things and cause you to be happier.
[14:45:01] <madprops> daevski, well im writing that in a js file
[14:45:42] <daevski> madprops, I'm not sure how to read that sentence. Do you mean you already are writing that, or you are going to?
[14:45:48] <madprops> i fear thats the only way i can add the onclick function right now
[14:46:45] <madprops> daevski, im building an html to show in a prompt http://www.radpaste.com/166/
[14:48:44] <daevski> madprops, okay, then take out the onClick inside the div and and just do <div> + files[key] + </div> .... then outside of the function, what I wrote before.
[14:49:25] <daevski> madprops, I don't think it will matter when the div is created, if it's clicked that new code should fire.
[14:51:23] <madprops> daevski, can i do that inside a js function?
[14:51:27] <madprops> add non-string divs?
[14:51:42] <daevski> madprops, this should do exactly what you want, without the inline onClick > http://www.radpaste.com/167/
[14:52:38] <madprops> daevski, ok i got you
[14:53:00] <daevski> madprops, it wouldn't need to be in the function as long as it's inside a $(document).ready(function(){ // that bit outside the function in here });
[14:53:29] <daevski> Anyone know why this code applies the .hovered and then removes it from one keypress? > http://pastebin.com/gLjDX8kB
[14:55:35] <FiSHNUGGET> I am having trouble setting a new background-image w/ jquery.  Here's my code $("#examCertificate").css('background-image',"url('"+data+"')");
[14:56:22] <Dave_Stein> im outta here. have a good labor day weekend people :)
[14:57:46] <jwmann> daevski: That parent() selector doesn't seem to help me too much
[14:57:53] <daevski> FiSHNUGGET, did you try just .css('bacground', 'url()') instead of background-image? (that will also negate all other background attributes though)
[14:58:06] <daevski> jwmann, how come?
[14:58:48] <jwmann> daevski: Since each a is in a separate div, using parent only selects the div that the first a is in
[14:59:29] <FiSHNUGGET> daev - lemme try
[14:59:49] <jwmann> daevski: Essentially I need to go to the parent of the anchor and the select the previous sibiling of the div and then select the anchor with that previous div
[14:59:54] <madprops> daevski, hmm that didnt work, i guess the divs have to be already inside the dom http://www.radpaste.com/169/
[15:00:02] <daevski> jwmann, that's what 'this' is for. It should get the parent of the link that you clicked instead of the first one. see again -> $('a').click(function(){ $(this).parent().hide() })
[15:01:06] <FiSHNUGGET> daev - when I do that, it actually adds the background-image attrib
[15:01:11] <FiSHNUGGET> but still doesn't work
[15:01:35] <daevski> madprops, notice how mine is completely outside the function. Yours in still inside the function: http://www.radpaste.com/167/
[15:01:53] <jwmann> daevski: That's the problem. it select the div that encompasses my anchor. I want the div 'before' the 'div' that encompasses my anchor, so I can then select the anchor within the new div
[15:02:36] <daevski> madprops, better yet, this is with the document ready bit also: http://www.radpaste.com/170/
[15:02:56] <sgharms> High all, I'm using jQuery under Rails and am a bit stumped.  I'm debugging the issue via Safari's console.  When I try to highlight an item with -- $("shout_73").effect("highlight", {}, 1500) -- I get TypeError: Result of expression '$("shout_73").effect' [undefined] is not a function.  What does that mean?
[15:03:23] <daevski> jwmann, ah, okay then :) use .prev in addition to .parent then... one sec....
[15:03:29] <sgharms> per the tutorial I'm looking at, it seems like that's the proper syntax
[15:03:41] <daevski> jwmann, $('a').click(function(){ $(this).parent.prev().hide() })
[15:03:58] <madprops> daevski, i was just doing that :d
[15:03:59] <jwmann> daevski: I have <div><a>foo</a></div> and <div><a>bar</a></div>: Basically I want to click on the 'Foo' anchor and select the anchor next to it which is the 'Bar' anchor
[15:04:37] <daevski> jwmann, .next() and .prev() get the siblings. So you wanted to go up a level with .parent(), then over a sibling with .prev() -- let me know if that doesn't work also
[15:05:39] <daevski> madprops, this is the paste you gave me last, it has the .click with the open() function -> http://www.radpaste.com/169/
[15:05:51] <abjorn> t minus 3 hours until LANFest, awwww yeeah
[15:06:04] <daevski> abjorn, what's that?
[15:06:26] <abjorn> Intel LANFest, a weekend long LAN Party held by Intel
[15:06:57] <daevski> abjorn, for pron watching?

[15:07:12] <abjorn> for video gaman
[15:07:36] <daevski> abjorn, ah, that was my second guess ;) does intel make games?
[15:07:51] <abjorn> i think you know the answer to that lol
[15:08:59] <daevski> abjorn, I know they make hardware for games, but do they make games?
[15:09:04] <madprops> daevski, yeah i know i was correcting it
[15:09:11] <abjorn> no
[15:09:16] <abjorn> just the processors and such
[15:09:17] <daevski> madprops, did that work for ya then?

[15:10:46] <madprops> daevski, not really

[15:13:34] <SexNinja__> nick NinjaSex
[15:15:06] <jwmann> daevski: Okay, this is working, but how would I select my anchor now? $(this).parent().parent().prev()
[15:15:18] <NinjaSex> Is server-side templating?
[15:16:13] <NinjaSex> Is server-side templating dead?
[15:17:51] <daevski> jwmann, you mean the anchor within the new div? the one that is up higher?
[15:19:05] <daevski> jwmann, $(this).parent().parent().prev().children() (maybe .children('a') if you need to be specific)
[15:20:35] <daevski> Anyone know why this code applies the .hovered and then removes it from one keypress? > http://pastebin.com/gLjDX8kB

[15:29:41] <madprops> daevski, init is a function that is called at document load so i did this http://www.radpaste.com/171/ but no alert is being triggered
[15:29:55] <jaequery> how do you do that thing where you scroll down the page and suddenly something appears up top? basically i want to know, how can i check if my page is being scrolled and how much of it is scrolled?
[15:31:24] <madprops> NinjaSex, well i rarely use django templating

[15:47:16] <devinrolsen> google maps is driving me crazy. It's as if it is impossible to switch out google maps marker icons when you click them.
[15:50:50] <daevski> madprops, why do you refuse to use $(document).ready(function(){ //code here }) ?
[15:51:35] <tfitts> daevski: I thought that was the old way to do it
[15:52:45] <madprops> daevski, i do use it, it calls init()
[15:53:16] <daevski> tfitts, I have no idea, but doc ready works well. Other than that, madprops, it looks fine.
[15:54:51] <daevski> madprops, the documentation I'm looking at shows you need $( init ); before your code.
[15:55:07] <daevski> madprops, http://www.elated.com/articles/jquery-getting-started/
[15:55:34] <madprops> daevski, that was mean
[15:55:55] <daevski> madprops, what was mean?
[15:56:29] <madprops> nuffin
[15:56:40] <daevski> madprops, I said that I won't know what init is, and then I linked you some help about it.
[15:57:00] <madprops> daevski, ah didnt read the line before
[15:57:03] <madprops> daevski, lol

[16:09:56] <aeos> Hi, I want to change the text in the placeholder attribute in HTML5. when I do so through attr() it doesnt change the text on the screen. is there a way to tell the input box to redraw the placeholder text?
[16:11:15] <Guest96615> ah
[16:11:20] <jaequery> because i'm outputting to dom and when the content gets too large, it'll create a scrollbar ... and i need to know exactly whenever that occurs ... anybody wanna take a jab at it?
[16:11:35] <Guest96615> jaequery: document.body.scrollTop or document.documentElement.scrollTop
[16:11:49] <pifantastic> aeos: perhaps try emptying the value and triggering the change event?
[16:11:51] <FiSHNUGGET> For some reason I can't see a new background-image from a script, but I can from the console??!?  WTF?!?!

[16:11:56] <FiSHNUGGET> see = set
[16:12:34] <zoggy> is there a reason that www.jquery.com still shows 1.6.2 as latest?
[16:12:35] <daevski> FiSHNUGGET, logically speaking, it must be your code.
[16:12:46] <FiSHNUGGET> I can run the exact calls from console
[16:12:49] <FiSHNUGGET> and they all work
[16:13:00] <daevski> zoggy, because... you're in the twilight zone!! ~~~
[16:13:23] <daevski> FiSHNUGGET, paste your code for us.
[16:13:26] <FiSHNUGGET> ok

[16:39:20] <NinjaSex> Is it good for the CEO to ban jquery?
[16:40:56] <dotwired> hi, how can i provide a function in setTimeout this?
[16:41:05] <dotwired> i mean "this"
[16:41:56] <ColKurtz> explain dotwired
[16:42:18] <ColKurtz> do you have any example code on jsfiddle.net ?
[16:42:33] <dotwired> http://pastebin.com/5EkGrxDf
[16:42:36] <dotwired> this will not work
[16:42:43] <dotwired> i could make var self = this;
[16:42:52] <dotwired> i just wondered if there is a nicer way to do
[16:42:54] <ColKurtz> lol why did the ceo ban jquery NinjaSex ?
[16:43:16] <NinjaSex> ColKurtz: So middle level management couldn't hire hacks.
[16:45:34] <dotwired> so there is no nicer way to do so?
[16:46:09] <ColKurtz> NinjaSex, I would say it's draconian to ban jQuery altogether, but it is probably prudent to make sure they can do js without jquery too.
[16:47:12] <ColKurtz> dotwired, probably, but I don't know exactly what you're trying to do
[16:47:34] <dotwired> only to make this working in the setTimeout function
[16:47:55] <dotwired> without saying before "var self = this;" and then use self as this in the setTimeout
[16:48:12] <dotwired> i'm just curious, it's no big deal ;)
[16:48:23] <NinjaSex> ColKurtz: Sure
[16:48:27] <IdahoEv> is it possible to apply .datepicker()  to a class selector, not an id? selector?  I can't get it to work:  http://pastie.org/2473604

[16:50:31] <k1t> heya folks! I can't get my AJAX call to have a "success" state.. i keep getting the "error" from my response but I'm not sure what's going on (tried dev tools but couldnt really pinpoint where the issue is) its on http://oh.anyehosting.com/ when you submit that top search form "Search this site"
[16:51:09] <NinjaSex> ColKurtz: They are writing web apps that fail if the Internet isn't fast enough to load before the setTimeout()
[16:51:35] <k1t> the POST is going through
[16:51:47] <ColKurtz> lol NinjaSex
[16:51:47] <k1t> is it the format of the JSON response breaking it or something maybe?
[16:52:44] <k1t> my response headers are: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[16:52:45] <k1t> though
[16:52:46] <k1t> :(
[16:55:40] <pifantastic> k1t: your Ajax response is not JSON, but HTML
[16:55:55] <pifantastic> it's an HMTL page that says "The action you have requested is invalid."
[16:56:00] <k1t> pifantastic: could you tell me where you were able to see that
[16:56:07] <k1t> please :)

[17:05:44] <AaronDCampbell> If I do something like $('myselection').click(myobject.myfunction()); how can I get the element that was clicked from inside myobject.myfunction? Similar to $this in $('myselection').click(function(){$(this)});
[17:08:03] <ColKurtz> var myClick = $('#myselection').click(myobject.myfunction());
[17:08:13] <ColKurtz> maybe that works AaronDCampbell ?
[17:08:44] <ajpiano> AaronDCampbell: first of all, you would do .click(myobj.fn) not click(myobj.fn())
[17:08:47] <ajpiano> second you would use the event arg
[17:08:59] <AaronDCampbell> ColKurtz: I need access to what was clicked from INSIDE myobject.myfunction()
[17:09:01] <ajpiano> function(e) {  $(e.target) }
[17:09:08] <AaronDCampbell> ajpiano: Maybe the () are what's messing it up
[17:09:12] <ajpiano> yeup
[17:09:47] <ajpiano> AaronDCampbell: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide32
[17:09:48] <AaronDCampbell> ajpiano: That's exactly it...thanks
[17:10:39] <ColKurtz> ah right
[17:13:25] <FelicianoX> variables that start with $ mean anything in js?
[17:13:51] <chjj_> they mean the person coding is trendy
[17:13:55] <chjj_> ;p
[17:14:07] <ajpiano> ?$prefix
[17:14:08] <bot-t> It is a common convention to prefix variables that refer to jQuery objects with a $ (Ex. var $this = $(this). The $ has NO SPECIAL MEANING and is simply customary among some developers. Others object to it on the grounds that it is "Hungarian Notation." Feel free to use it or not!
[17:14:24] <FelicianoX> Oh ok
[17:14:34] <FelicianoX> gets a bit confusing sometimes when they use it alot
[17:14:49] <chjj> i like my explanation better
[17:16:16] <ColKurtz> it just means that it references the jquery object as well
[17:22:17] <AaronDCampbell> Is there a way to select unrelated items such as #myid and .myclass in one query?  Something like jQuery('#myid,.myclass')
[17:24:12] <ajpiano> AaronDCampbell: just like that
[17:24:16] <ColKurtz> that's exactly how AaronDCampbell
[17:24:32] <AaronDCampbell> lol...I think I typod in my code and NOT in the channel.
[17:24:36] <ColKurtz> it's just like CSS selectors. Except with some extra stuff you wish CSS selectors had.

[18:57:31] <astropirate> I is doing somethign like that too
[18:57:45] <astropirate> but need a good foundation so i'm doing this framework
[18:57:49] <Nuck> Unless it's a Prject Management System with git integration built on Node, a Mongo administration system like phpMyAdmin built on node, or a chat server using socket.io with node, I don't care :P
[18:58:12] <astropirate> Its a symfony2 like framework
[18:58:19] <Nuck> symfony2?
[18:58:22] <ajpiano> haha
[18:58:22] <Nuck> I use Express
[18:58:26] <Nuck> That's my framework
[18:58:28] <astropirate> from PHP
[18:58:31] <astropirate> i don't like express
[18:58:33] <astropirate> i mean its fine
[18:58:39] <astropirate> but there is no order to things
[18:58:41] <ajpiano> "for everyone who likes node but thinks it needs to feel more like php"
[18:58:49] <astropirate> no good god no!
[18:58:52] * Nuck points to EJS
[18:59:01] <snover> you know what itâs time for
[18:59:07] <snover> phpjs.org
[18:59:23] <Nuck> hahaha
[18:59:25] <Nuck> epic
[18:59:27] <astropirate> ajpiano, no i don't want it to feel like any other programming language. Just barrows good ideas from the framework not the php language
[18:59:29] <Nuck> I love phpjs
[18:59:34] <Nuck> It's so ridiculously bad
[19:00:20] <Nuck> I once got an unserialize script from there
[19:00:23] <Nuck> Then I rewrote it
[19:00:28] <Nuck> Because it was so fucking bad
[19:01:00] <JesperA> cool story bro
[19:01:11] <astropirate> tell it agian
[19:01:25] <ajpiano> Nuck: https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io-client/pull/292 was what i was grappling with
[19:01:25] <socialhapy> â Pull request on socket.io-client by tbranyen (10h, 59m ago): socket.io fails when no script tags are in the page
[19:02:26] <ajpiano> and obvs all the hybi/chrome stuff was a PITA but i guess that's behind us now
[19:02:38] <ajpiano> unless you wrote a nko app the weekend before it was released
[19:02:39] <ajpiano> haha
[19:03:34] <Nuck> ew
[19:03:38] <Nuck> that is a nasty hack
[19:04:21] <ajpiano> so is socket.io barfing if there are no script tags in the page as you insert it
[19:04:22] <ajpiano> :/
[19:04:25] <snover> so um
[19:04:27] <snover> document.scripts
[19:04:44] <snover> that is kind of an IE-only thing
[19:04:46] <snover> afaict
[19:04:53] <snover> either that or firebug can eat a bag
[19:04:57] <snover> but itâs not on mdn
[19:05:00] <ajpiano> i don't think it's a great solution to the prob
[19:05:49] <snover> it is kind of nuts that there is no way to load more external scripts without injecting elements to the DOM
[19:06:40] <astropirate> snover, can't you get it via ajax and then wrap it in an function and call it?
[19:07:11] <snover> if you do that you break the ability for browsers to correctly identify and trace calls.
[19:07:39] <edude03> Hello everyone
[19:07:58] <Nuck|mobile> Bola
[19:08:05] <Nuck|mobile> Hola even
[19:08:42] <edude03> So I have a dumbass problem I can't seem to figure out, In my app I'm trying to use $(document).ready(â¦) I'm making sure to load Jquery before the my code but when I call an alert inside document ready it doesn't get called
[19:11:03] <ajpiano> are you like, runnning a debugger that will notify you of basic syntax errors
[19:11:31] <edude03> Code is here http://pastium.org/view/86337d69c1a2c64efb874a50f9c0d218
[19:11:34] <Nuck> ajpiano: I assume not by the use of alert() instead of console.log() :P
[19:11:42] <edude03> Yes, I'm using Firebug, and it's not reporting any errors
[19:11:42] <ajpiano> hahah
[19:12:19] <ajpiano> what is $(button).preventDefault() supposed to even do
[19:12:28] <ajpiano> :/
[19:12:33] <snover>   PREVENT DEFAULT FOREVRERRRRRRR
[19:12:45] <ajpiano> edude03: preventDefault is a method of an event object
[19:13:04] <ajpiano> not an arbitrary jquery collection, especially one created from an undefined variable
[19:13:11] <edude03> yeah, it should be click or something
[19:13:29] <ajpiano> ?demo @ edude03
[19:13:30] <bot-t> edude03, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:14:04] <edude03> I just threw that in there to spice things up :P
[19:15:30] <ajpiano> lol
[19:16:16] <edude03> Putting up a demo is somewhat difficult since the page is running locally and the js for the plugins is local too : /
[19:16:46] <ajpiano> well
[19:16:58] <ajpiano> do you want me to make a live demo that proves that document ready DOES work???
[19:17:10] <Nuck> ajpiano: lol
[19:17:11] <Nuck> Genius!
[19:17:46] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/cYsLp/
[19:20:07] <edude03> Oh I'm sure it does work, it's not my first time using JQ, I just seem to be failing at something and I can't figure out what it is :/
[19:20:24] <edude03> OK check this out http://jsfiddle.net/QrD7z/1/
[19:20:57] <ajpiano> well
[19:21:08] <ajpiano> jsfiddle has like, "right places" for things like that to go
[19:21:14] <edude03> The stuff below more should be hidden until you click more
[19:21:21] <ajpiano> put only the body html int he html part, load the resources in the add resources tab
[19:21:27] <ajpiano> unfortunately for you but very fortunately me
[19:21:30] <ajpiano> i'm about to ship
[19:21:48] <ajpiano> a project after a month
[19:21:57] <ajpiano> and then go romance my new madden 12
[19:22:06] <edude03> Nice
[19:22:20] <edude03> Though that does sound unfortunate for me :P
[19:23:01] <edude03> It's OK though ajpiano thanks for your time :)
[19:24:42] <ajpiano> gluck :)
[19:40:53] <jita> I have implemented tooltip for a list, but the problem is, the tooltip gets stuck on clicking the item im playlist, here is the screen capture http://postimage.org/image/2qrifyig4/
[19:40:57] <jita> how do i resolve it ?
[20:42:45] <stuajc> i'm trying to solve a problem with jquery but i think i'm searching for a solution using inadequate terms or something. i have a post on the front page of my blog. about half the post is displayed. upon clicking 'continue reading,' a user is lead to that post's page. i want that post's page to load scrolled down to the point they were reading at. ideas?
[20:43:53] <ajpiano> you don't need javascript at all
[20:43:56] <ajpiano> for that
[20:45:38] <stuajc> go on?
[20:46:06] <ajpiano> <a href="full_post_url.html#whatever">
[20:46:19] <ajpiano> <a name='whatever">
[20:46:43] <ajpiano> that's how websites work
[20:47:19] <stuajc> ahhh right, sorry, to be clearer i want it automated for each post--wouldn't i have to manually add anchors into each blog post to be able to do that
[20:48:08] <ajpiano> oh boy
[20:49:08] <coldhead> :D
[20:54:08] <stuajc> hm
[20:54:14] <stuajc> wrong place for that question
[20:54:18] <stuajc> thanks anyway
[20:55:58] <jjjrmy> Hi, people. I have a question for you. Anyone around to answer.
[20:56:30] <Zackko> id like to build a query plugin that transforms a multiselect like this: http://loudev.com/ but i would like to implement a search bar for the left box so if your dealing with a large number of entries, you can do a quick AJAX-driven search on the fly and narrow results, problem is, after repopulating the box with the narrowed results, I'm not sure of the best way to hide the ones that have been already selected. any thoughts?
[20:57:58] <Zackko> and also any thoughts on how to make that AJAX-search as universal as possible would be cool too. id like to not have to write a custom ajax call/php handler for every single transformed <select>
[21:02:45] <jkline> why not just use that one zackko?
[21:03:25] <Zackko> i could, and i probably would, but i need ajax search/narrow functionality
[21:04:02] <jkline> also this Zackko http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[21:04:17] <jkline> so you need to populate the select via an ajax request just one time?
[21:04:26] <jkline> or you want to do an autocomplete that makes a request each time the user types?
[21:05:29] <jkline> I think probably the best thing is to treat it as two separate problems. Step one, populate your select box. Step two, enable an existing enhancer widtget
[21:06:53] <Zackko> well, it would be nice to make an ajax call but i suppose your right and for performance purposes I should just narrow afterward. my thoughts were if I was dealing with like thousands of results, I'm not sure id want to pull ALL ofthem on the first load, hence the ajax callâ¦any thoughts?
[21:07:13] <Zackko> and btw that plugin you showed me is very nice
[21:08:30] <jkline> Zackko: thanks, I had nothing to do with making that plugin :)
[21:08:51] <jkline> Zackko:  i still don't understand, do you envision making one ajax call per select, or multiple?
[21:09:44] <jkline> because the jQuery UI Autocomplete works pretty darn well for and can make ajax requests each time the user changes their entry. I think it does multi-select also
[21:09:49] <Zackko> an ajax call per onKeyup event for the search bar
[21:10:09] <jkline> Zackko: gotcha, multiple ajax. Yeah, try autocomplete
[21:10:29] <jkline> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple
[21:10:31] <Zackko> i just don't want to pull 1000 rows unless the user doesn't see what they need in the first say 100 results
[21:11:14] <jkline> Zackko: yeah, download only what you need. Makes sense.
[21:11:50] <jkline> http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#multiple-remote is actually closer to what you want
[21:16:40] <Zackko> it indeed does make ajax calls like i want, but I'm not entirely sure how that thing works. i don't see in firebug that its placing any hidden input elements or anything and thats kinda what you need it to do for it to behave like a <select> am i correct?
[21:17:04] <jkline> hmmm
[21:17:19] <Zackko> that first link you showed me is basically what I'm looking for...
[21:17:37] <Zackko> except instead of narrowing the results using just JS, id like to repopulate using ajax. got it?
[21:18:17] <jkline> yes, I got it. I don't know of any plugin that works exactly like you want. I think you can probably extend or modify one those however
[21:18:28] <jkline> for autocomplete it will work in a form no problem "The value will be inserted into the input element after the user selected something from the menu."
[21:18:52] <Zackko> yea I'm just not sure upon repopulation how to detect which ones have been already selected
[21:19:21] <jkline> check the current value of the element
[21:19:58] <Zackko> right, but it just like appends textual values via a comma, not separate selections using the whole <input name="someName[]" â¦ /> method
[21:20:03] <Zackko> it was nothing haha
[21:20:14] <Zackko> there was no value attr in firebug
[21:21:59] <jkline> $('select').val().split(',') ?
[21:22:09] <Zackko> i can actually see it in the DOM tab, but it allows user to randomly type in values. i need a forced set of selectable options like a multiselect allows for
[21:23:05] <Zackko> just picture that first link i sent you with a small search bar above the left box that repopulates the select-from box via ajax
[21:23:39] <Zackko> the autocomplete is perfect for like search boxesn stuff
[21:24:07] <Zackko> but this is for like say "choosing which privileges a user has" or something
[21:24:11] <Zackko> in an admin interface
[21:30:09] <jkline> on http://loudev.com/ the command $('ms-866').val() returns me an array of selected values
[21:33:54] <Zackko> mm good calâ¦i could just plant a Display: none on all matching items from the ajax call
[21:34:24] <jkline> yeah, or filter the list
[21:34:33] <jkline> >>> ['foo', 'bar', 'ca', 'ar', 'zot'].filter( function(a) { console.log('checking', a); return $.inArray( a, $('#ms-866').val() ) > 0 } )
[21:34:50] <jkline> there is probably a more efficient way to do that
[21:36:33] <Zackko> yea, I'm not a js pro so id hafa really think it out to come up with something really efficient, but that def would work
[21:36:52] <Zackko> now i just gotta figure out how the plugin works so i can integrate the ajax functionality
[21:37:09] <Zackko> weird that they didn't test in IE6 tho
[21:38:32] <Zackko> is it proper to add non-standard attributes to html elements via js?
[21:39:16] <SharkUW> yes, browsers don't give a damn.
[21:39:26] <Zackko> ok
[21:40:11] <Zackko> hey, i thought if you put display: none on a form element, it doesnt submit that element?
[21:40:35] <SharkUW> I wouldn't trust that...
[21:40:56] <Zackko> i could def be wrong, but i thought i tried it and it failed to submit it in the past
[21:41:55] <SharkUW> too many potential issues for all browsers handling that the same and that's certainly not going to work as intended with no JS
[21:43:25] <Zackko> well I'm not implying i want to keep something from submitting by putting Display: none on it, but this plugin hides that <select> that way and if that were the case, there would be no value for it in the $_POST array
[21:45:26] <SharkUW> probably simplest to look at the request from the browser instead what PHP is revealing to avoid any behaviors there in figuring it out.
[21:46:11] <Zackko> mk
[22:17:47] <Jarred> Does anyone know of any scripts to make rounded corners work in IE7/8?
[22:17:54] <Jarred> (With modernizr of course)
[22:19:51] <spoonman> =>jarred : PIE.js
[22:33:28] <ace_me> hi ! I am using a YII widget which creates a slider on a page with a php syntax like $this->widget('zii.widgets.jui.CJuiSlider'... and later in JS code I want to change the slider value ! How can I point back to the created slider please ? any ideea ?
[22:34:58] <SharkUW> that framework any good?
[22:35:38] <ace_me> is quite good I think...
[22:36:06] <ace_me> used to work more with symfony but lifes change everything SharkUW :)
[22:36:25] <SharkUW> http://www.yiiframework.com/doc/api/1.1/CJuiSlider looks like you can get the id
[22:39:13] <ace_me> I've tried to pass a option to it 'id'=>'firstslider', but seems was not working and later to get with Jquery like $('#firstslider...
[22:40:02] <ace_me> I am a person who can learn by example ! sometimes i feel difficult to get how things works without one
[22:40:17] <SharkUW> I mean I believe widget() returns the option with an id property if I'm reading that correctly.
[22:40:36] <SharkUW> returns the widget rather
[22:40:40] <SharkUW> object*
[22:42:01] <SharkUW> that make sense?
[22:42:08] <Jarred> How would I require a JS library through JS?
[22:42:17] <ace_me> yes but I need it's value in a jscode SharkUW
[22:42:45] <ace_me> that means maybe to initiate a <script area and define after that widget a var slidervalue = ?.value
[22:43:01] <ace_me> that means maybe to initiate a <script area and define after that widget a var slidervalue = previousslider.value
[22:43:12] <SharkUW> echo "<script>var importantID=".$theID."</script>";
[22:43:18] <supertrue> how would I select all divs with class .foo whose content (not including html tags) is exactly equal to 'bla' (not just contains bla but is equal to bla)?
[22:43:40] <SharkUW> jarred, I don't understand the question.
[22:44:18] <jkline> Zackko: set property "disabled" will prevent a form element from submitting. Display none does not effect that.
[22:45:05] <Zackko> YES
[22:45:07] <Jarred> SharkUW In Ruby you would do something like "require 'bagels' if out_of_pizza"
[22:45:09] <SharkUW> supertrue $(div.foo).each(function(){if(this.html()=="bar")dostuff();}); I think
[22:45:14] <Zackko> thats what I did haha..thanks
[22:45:23] <Jarred> Where require 'bagels' inserts another JS library
[22:45:24] <SharkUW> don't recall if html is innerHTML or not. I think it is
[22:45:52] <SharkUW> oh, so conditional include?
[22:46:36] <Jarred> Yes
[22:47:12] <SharkUW> it's not particularly clean but you can document.write some <script src="foo"></script> and continue async by polling for a variable to be set. Probably a better way but that'd work off the top of my head.
[22:47:38] <SharkUW> that is to say set bar=true if not including foo and set bar=true via foo if it is
[22:47:48] <supertrue> SharkUW: I think that .html() includes tags
[22:47:49] <SharkUW> and interval to continue with bar is true
[22:48:13] <SharkUW> oh, use innerHTML in that case. there's probably something in jquery for it but no point really. It's supported in everything.
[22:49:10] <supertrue> .text() does it
[22:49:20] <Jarred> SharkUW That doesn't help anything because I'm doing this to make the page load faster
[22:49:36] <Jarred> I want to include the stuff for IE interopability
[22:49:41] <Jarred> (PIE.js and Modernizr)
[22:49:44] <SharkUW> oh, lol
[22:49:48] <SharkUW> google "ie conditional"
[22:49:54] <Jarred> No
[22:49:56] <SharkUW> ?
[22:50:06] <Jarred> The only pages that should have to download Modernizr or PIE.js content is IE
[22:50:08] <Jarred> er
[22:50:09] <Jarred> browser
[22:50:13] <Jarred> If I just conditionally include it
[22:50:16] <Jarred> It'll still be downloaded
[22:50:27] <SharkUW> nope, not down-level hidden
[22:50:36] <SharkUW> it'll be a comment to any non-IE browser
[22:51:04] <SharkUW> <!--[if blah]
[22:58:26] <ace_me> SharkUW I did $slider = $this->widget('zii.widget... and later echo "<script>alert(".$slider::getId().");</script>"; but I see error in firebug
[22:59:05] <ace_me> I am wrong isn't it SharkUW ?
[22:59:28] <SharkUW> should be dot and not scope
[22:59:42] <RobW> anyone have a carfax/autocheck acct and can run reports? msg me
[23:00:37] <SharkUW> but that probably shouldn't give you a JS error. Is it spitting out a php error in there? That'd probably do it.
[23:01:20] <SharkUW> oh I see the js issue. You need quotes in your quotes dog.
[23:01:36] <SharkUW> one of these \"" and at the end should be one of these "\"
[23:02:07] <SharkUW> also the scope vs dot issue on the php end
[23:10:57] <ace_me> SharkUW http://pastebin.com/e7sgEYte
[23:12:24] <SharkUW> oh right, -> in php. lol my bad
[23:12:36] <ace_me> http://pastebin.com/e7sgEYte
[23:13:42] <SharkUW> i'm not sure what I'm looking at with 4 similar sets.
[23:14:00] <SharkUW> my question though is what is the html that is actually spit out for the script block
[23:14:34] <SharkUW> oh wait, just noticed it
[23:14:36] <SharkUW> 's the same link
[23:16:10] <SharkUW> what's it actually printing for <script..../script>?
[23:16:28] <ace_me> there I see yv0
[23:16:52] <SharkUW> does that element exist on the page as yv0?
[23:17:28] <ace_me> <script>var sliderId = 'yw0';</script>
[23:17:42] <ace_me> yes it exists
[23:17:57] <SharkUW> also you can't .value a jQuery object. You have to grab [0] or use the jQuery function for value or attr('value')
[23:18:04] <SharkUW> probably an issue there
[23:18:12] <ace_me> aha
[23:18:16] <SharkUW> [0].value I mean to say
[23:19:16] <SharkUW> This is fun. I should hang out here more often.
[23:20:08] <ace_me> I did console.log ($( "#"+sliderId )); and now I get attempoted to compileand go script on a cleared scope
[23:21:08] <SharkUW> I'm not sure what you mean with "attempted to compile and go"
[23:21:19] <ace_me> better now slider = $( "#"+sliderId ); console.log (slider[0]);
[23:21:32] <ace_me> and get a <div id="yw0" class="ui-slider ui-slider-horizontal ui-widget ui-widget-content ui-corner-all" style="height:10px;background:#C9E0ED">
[23:22:05] <SharkUW> cool
[23:22:09] <ace_me> which unfortunatelly is not the slider object
[23:22:13] <SharkUW> hmm
[23:22:15] <ace_me> I think
[23:22:34] <SharkUW> which element is that? looks like it's been assigned classes to style/script it?
[23:23:05] <SharkUW> might have children you need to grab based on that, but I'd guess it's not giving out a wrong yet valid id :P
[23:28:54] <ace_me> lot of childrens !
[23:29:00] <ace_me> thank you SharkUW
[23:29:11] <ace_me> still nedd to scroll them to see where value is
[23:29:14] <SharkUW> no problem
[23:29:49] <SharkUW> do the widgets not have any js hooks to grab the value?
[23:31:57] <ace_me> not sure SharkUW I am quite noob there
[23:32:15] <ace_me> anyhow seems i see no value or so for the slider !
[23:32:19] <SharkUW> they do
[23:33:00] <ace_me> I have defined a offset of 50 and a min and max
[23:33:16] <ace_me> so how to call that hooks SharkUW ?
[23:34:06] <SharkUW> http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#event-change
[23:35:54] <SharkUW> looks like it'll be firing off some custom events
[23:46:22] <ace_me> SharkUW here is the answer console.log (sliderId+' '+$( "#"+sliderId ).slider("value")); ;) thank you very much
[23:47:59] <SharkUW> cool
[23:56:13] <bakkot> This isn't the right place for this, but I don't know what the right place is, so hopefully someone here can direct me there:
[23:56:21] <bakkot> Both Chrome and Firefox are much, much slower running code which is entirely contained within an onclick than they are running code in a <script> tag. Compare:
[23:56:26] <bakkot> http://kevingibbons.org/jsexample_onclick.html
[23:56:31] <bakkot> http://kevingibbons.org/jsexample_script.html
[23:56:38] <zoggy> use jsperf
[23:57:58] <SharkUW> these days imo if that sort of a problem/limitation is reached then you're either doing it wrong or shouldn't be doing it with js anyways. lol
[23:58:42] <bakkot> zoggy, jsperf won't work here.
