[00:00:02] <nights> I'm apending input boxes through jquery and I would like to have the ID on each have index that count up
[00:01:07] <nights> I thought of making an async call to keep indexing, but would like to find a solution that is strictly clientside
[00:01:11] <nights> anyone know how?
[00:01:42] <Fernandos1> jrockjiggz: sorry, didn't see your message. colorbox is nicely evented I can only recommend it.
[00:04:09] <nights> nm i found solution online
[00:09:36] <ksylvest> Hey, just wondering if anyone has any good standards or guides for packaging up static assets with a jQuery plugin (i.e. CSS + images)
[00:09:54] <ksylvest> mainly techniques to avoid conflicting when users install and to allow flexibility when overriding.
[00:13:42] <href> hi
[00:13:54] <href> I wanna execute this line after 500 ms ->     Yamli.deyamlify("txtMyStream");
[00:14:02] <href> how can I achieve that with .delay()?
[00:14:41] <ksylvest> You can't use .delay() as it is primarily for dealing with jQuery effect queueing
[00:14:57] <href> How should I do it?
[00:15:00] <ksylvest> Instead you should use the jQuery setTimeout
[00:15:36] <href> could you please tell me how?

[00:31:00] <href> one more question
[00:32:03] <href> i have two divs. and a mouseover event (on div1) to show a absolute positionned div (div3) on mouseover the nested div (div2) inside (div1) div3 still shows...
[00:32:06] <href> How can I stop that?
[00:34:57] <coldhead> if ($(e.target).is('.div2')) return;
[00:35:28] <coldhead> provided you do .bind('mouseover', function (e) {...

[02:23:02] <pharvey> best syntax highlighter - does anybody use snippet (based on shjs)? Or is google-code-prettify the way to go... trying to replace chili, which is borked on FF7
[02:35:04] <Bjeaurn> goodmorning! I've got a weird error I can't much about on the web: TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (near '....autocomplete({...') - I'm trying to get the autocomplete() function from jqueryUI to work.
[02:35:35] <Bjeaurn> and the weird thing is, I've got it working very nicely on a different page. Am including both files (checked em both by adding a little "alert("Test");") and really have no clue what could be going wrong...
[02:43:59] <Bjeaurn> http://jsfiddle.net/dQTve/ that's the code to get it started, didn't add the includes there.
[03:06:30] <simon> can I make a selection query within a sub-structure of the DOM?
[03:07:37] <simon> I should probably just refer to the precise content.
[03:10:38] <simon> ah, I was looking for .find()
[03:12:16] <Bjeaurn> :)
[04:02:03] <SoulRaven> hi
[04:02:24] <SoulRaven> anyone try google maps and jquery ui dialog and ui tabs?
[04:12:03] <SoulRaven> anyone try google maps and jquery ui dialog and ui tabs?
[04:40:58] <biomass> I'm trying to get this animation to work but the div just doesn't seem to move - http://pastie.org/2744762 - any hints would be most welcome
[04:52:57] <Bjeaurn> biomass: did you try to debug your code?
[04:53:17] <Bjeaurn> by adding alert("Test"); within your $("#picstart").mouseenter(function(){ ?
[04:53:33] <Bjeaurn> to test if your code gets executed? So you can see if your .animate() is wrong, or that your mouseenter is not registering.

[05:04:50] <Tant102> Or is the "-,_" the jump? It could easily be angled somewhat up for a better jump.

[05:34:01] <Tobsn> https://50.16.242.188/
[05:34:11] <Tobsn> seems like the servers are up
[05:34:24] <Tobsn> nevermind
[05:34:26] <Tobsn> theyre down
[05:36:44] <Tobsn> uh thats funny... if domain != foursquare redirect to https://+host
[05:37:04] <Tobsn> someone at foursquare did not prepare for this hehe

[06:09:29] <Tobsn> should you have DVT?
[06:09:32] <Tobsn> DVB?
[06:09:34] <Tobsn> or whatever the name was

[06:11:35] <ahandy> Tobsn: thank you :D
[06:11:37] <Tobsn> seqastian, so you got dvbt?
[06:12:02] <seqastian> no i dont
[06:12:09] <seivan> Anyone know how to do the activity stream here on http://www.meetup.com/ - I got the socket connection down. But not the animation parts.
[06:12:12] <seivan> i am using slideDown and fadeIn but does not look as nice, especially the part where it pushes the last part "under"
[06:12:15] <seqastian> witing for the analog signal to be turned off
[06:12:18] <Tobsn> ha
[06:12:33] <Tobsn> seivan, look at the source
[06:12:38] <seivan> I did
[06:12:39] <Tobsn> fyi https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo <- this is awesome
[06:18:15] <seqastian> looks interesting
[06:18:34] <PrgmrBill> I don't understand why they use URIs like that
[06:18:42] <PrgmrBill> seems like a pretty limited permutation
[06:22:27] <Tobsn> i bet its a key in their weird ass database
[06:22:51] <Tobsn> by now im convinced they use the same huge database cluster for all their products
[06:22:57] <Tobsn> whatever they build = one large db cluster
[06:24:04] <Tobsn> hmm can i check if a number is a float even if its negative?
[06:25:30] <Tobsn> rather check if a latitude is a latitude

[06:38:00] <temp01> you can PM the bot

[06:38:32] <Tobsn> :)
[06:55:56] <Stuffness> is there any function that will replace the text of an element but will leave its child elements alone?
[06:56:44] <Stuffness> ex. if I have <span id="target">replace this text <span>protect this span</span></span>
[06:57:00] <PrgmrBill> you could use classes to narrow it down
[06:57:24] <PrgmrBill> e.g. $('#target').find('span.replaceme').text('sup')
[06:58:14] <Stuffness> Yep I could, but that would require additional elements
[06:58:31] <Stuffness> Just wondering if something like what I described exists.. I guess not
[06:58:44] <PrgmrBill> I was unaware of that requirement
[06:58:57] <Stuffness> I'm not sure if it's at all a common requirement
[06:59:00] <Stuffness> Probably not
[06:59:48] <Jayflux> Stuffness http://api.jquery.com/parent-selector/ maybe
[07:03:10] <pentarex1> hey guys
[07:03:22] <pentarex1> can anyone recommend me a proxy so I can execute ajax requests
[07:03:39] <pentarex1> without stubbling on same origin policy
[07:09:51] <Stuffness> Maybe it's 'cause I'm tired, but more likely because I'm a beginner at this, but the :parent thing isn't making sense to me.
[07:10:05] <Stuffness> In their example, it doesn't seem to be selecting the parent element.
[07:10:39] <Stuffness> http://jsfiddle.net/FdBNW/2/    here too, I get the same result by just using "span" instead of "span:parent"
[07:39:33] <hoffmanc> is there a nice plugin/method for making an editable list a la workflowy.com ?
[07:50:04] <hoffmanc> is there a nice plugin/method for making an editable list a la workflowy.com ?
[08:06:38] <ahandy> can you guys tell me why this code breaks? http://jsfiddle.net/w5dMr/
[08:11:04] <ahandy> anyone?
[08:11:25] <juha_> ?anyone
[08:11:26] <bot-t> Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[08:11:36] <ahandy> i did ask :p
[08:12:06] <juha_> finalPrice is not defined
[08:12:16] <juha_> you should use console to check for errors :P
[08:12:31] <ahandy> juha_: ...? i set var $finalPrice = '100.00';
[08:12:41] <juha_> and then you call finalPrice
[08:12:45] <juha_> not $finalPrice
[08:12:48] <ahandy> ohhh
[08:12:50] <ahandy> thanks juha_ :D
[08:13:08] <juha_> you should use console, will let you know errors faster
[08:13:11] <juha_> speeds up your life
[08:13:21] <ahandy> juha_: which console? (sorry still kinda new to jquery.. im more of a php developer)
[08:13:35] <juha_> what browser are you using?
[08:13:51] <ahandy> juha_: chromium
[08:13:58] <juha_> basically you'll see console from any modern browser by pressing F12
[08:14:05] <juha_> there will be lot's of interesting stuff
[08:14:12] <ahandy> juha_: found it! Thanks :D
[08:14:18] <juha_> and then a console tab, which will show you errors
[08:14:36] <juha_> and you can debug stuff easily with console.log("lol"); type of commands

[08:22:10] <Kwpolska> $('#sitetitle').html('Projects/'+friendlyName);
[08:24:56] <juha_> Kwpolska: you can also use text() if you don't plan to add any markup on it
[08:35:08] <Microtom> hello, when I append a button in my html, it doesn't become a jquery ui button, just a normal one. I assume all buttons are changed when the page load in the ready function, so it's why the ones I want to append later don't work. But how can I make them become jquery ui button when I append them?
[08:37:47] <Jayflux> Microtom sounds like you need to add a live or delegate handler to whichever function makes them buttons in the first place
[08:38:22] <Microtom> k I'll read about these
[08:38:28] <Microtom> sry I'm really newb
[08:47:22] <SoulRaven> help me with this, http://jsfiddle.net/3wSGX/
[08:47:41] <SoulRaven> on the first call data data are displayed on the ui dialog
[08:48:00] <SoulRaven> but the secound time when i call the dialog, return empty
[08:48:12] <SoulRaven> and $('#fetch') is empty
[08:49:07] <Kwpolska> Another stupid question: I have a bunch of links in a ul id="projectlistcontents".  I want to assign an onclick event on them, which will run a function with parameters a.title and a.id (with dashes replaced by slashes).
[08:49:20] <Kwpolska> How to do that?
[08:50:16] <SoulRaven> in the example above, i want to display a google map
[08:50:24] <dabear> Kwpolska: you have multiple elements with same id?
[08:50:40] <dabear> Kwpolska: can't you change that? no two elements shoudl have the same id..
[08:51:31] <Kwpolska> dabear: where did I say that?
[08:52:06] <dabear> right, I thought you did, but you had a wrapper ul instead iwth that id
[08:53:14] <dabear> Kwpolska: anyway, add an event listener to the anchors, and then do yourFunc(this.title, this.id) ?
[08:53:30] <Kwpolska> dabear: that's quite right.
[08:55:08] <Kwpolska> how to merge two jquery arrays?
[08:55:22] <Kwpolska> javascript*
[08:56:52] <puppen> jQuery.merge(); || var a=[]; var b=[]; a.concat(b);
[09:00:30] <Kwpolska> oh wait.  so $('something').children('a') doesn't return an array?  So what is it?
[09:00:53] <PrgmrBill> schrodinger's array. might be an array, might not
[09:02:44] <Whirl3d> Good Morning all, could someone point me to a tutorial for creating my own "draggable" script. It's really complicated and I would prefer to learn how to do it rather than rely on a plugin.
[09:07:27] <dabear> Whirl3d: simple, onmousedown on div, allow dragging, dissallow on mouseup. and then onmousemove if dragging is allowed, move the div based on where the mousepointer is. e.clientX and e.clientY tells you the coordinates
[09:08:38] <Flam> Whirl3d: it's basically binding mousedown/mousemove/mouseup
[09:08:45] <Flam> to something.
[09:09:16] <Whirl3d> dabear, flam, thanks for the replies. I understand the event coordination. I am having problems with applying limits and movement to the "draggable" item.
[09:09:55] * Whirl3d looking up e.clientX...
[09:12:38] <Flam> 	var tmp = (e.pageX-90/2);   		//console.log(e.pageX + "- "+ tmp);		if (tmp < 0 || tmp > lineWidth)    return;	
[09:13:05] <Flam> something like that
[09:13:30] <Whirl3d> Flam, what is the 90/2 for?
[09:14:40] <Whirl3d> I basically want to make an element draggable within it's parent only.
[09:14:42] <Flam> ignore that for now.  console.log(e.pageX); and play with it
[09:14:59] <Whirl3d> Flam, will do. Thanks.
[09:15:01] <Flam> drag it without limitations and find what values work then implement them
[09:15:17] <Kwpolska> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/496918/ -- what shall I do?
[09:15:47] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I was hoping there would be a good "draggable" tutorial somewhere. Looks like I'll have to figure it out the long way and make my own tutorial. Thanks for the help
[09:22:27] <Microtom> ok I got a question related to .live()
[09:23:23] <puppen> "hello, may i ask a question?"... What's the question?
[09:23:44] <Microtom> if I append my button and want it to become a jquery ui button, I could do something like $("#mybutton").live("hover", function{$(this).button();})
[09:24:04] <Microtom> but it would only become a jquery ui button when it's hovered over
[09:24:23] <Microtom> I was it to become a jquery-ui button wehn it it appended
[09:24:42] <Microtom> was=want
[09:25:25] <Microtom> so what can I put in the live() object instead of "hover"
[09:28:54] <dabear> Microtom: you cannot do that, but you can cheat it by using livequery
[09:29:00] <dabear> ?livequery @ Microtom
[09:29:01] <bot-t> Microtom, Live Query | jQuery Plugins - Live Query (formerly Behavior) utilizes the power of jQuery selectors by binding events or firing callbacks for matched elements auto-magically, even after the page has been loaded and the DOM upda... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/livequery
[09:29:20] <dabear> it can figure out when a new element is inserted
[09:29:28] <Microtom> k
[09:29:32] <dabear> only gotcha is that you have to insert the new element with jquery
[09:29:40] <dabear> or it won't work
[09:30:27] <Microtom> kk
[09:30:38] <Microtom> such as append I assume
[09:33:16] <Whirl3d> If I define a mousemove handler within a mousedown handler, the mousemove handler should continue until I unbind it, right? Currently, when I mouseup, the mousemove handler stops...
[09:34:02] <dabear> Whirl3d: don't do that
[09:34:17] <Whirl3d> dabear, sure, but why?
[09:34:20] <dabear> define all handlers first
[09:34:40] <dabear> because you will rebind the element fore every time the mousemove occurs
[09:35:05] <Whirl3d> I'm trying to get jsfiddle to work so I can post my code. brb
[09:35:16] <dabear> mousedown*
[09:35:54] <dabear> you will end up with multiple mousemove handlers, one extra for every time you click the element
[09:35:57] <dabear> which is bad
[09:38:39] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/VeRAL/1/
[09:39:11] <Whirl3d> dabear, thanks for your help. I had planned to unbind the mousemove handler on mouseup...but it appears that it automatically is unbound on mouseup...
[09:39:29] <Microtom> woot it works! so happy :P I simply did $(".button").livequery(function(){$(this).button();}); thanks a bunch dabear!
[09:44:01] <dabear> Whirl3d: it is certainly not removed on mouseup unless you do that unbinding your self
[09:48:38] <Whirl3d> That's what I figured. It must be a bug. You can see that the mousemove code generates a console.log that only fires if moused down (or over, oddly enough)..
[09:49:16] <Whirl3d> when it should fire continuously regardless.
[09:56:47] <Kwpolska> I have an object called list and a variable called url.  object = {'foo': 'bar'}.  url = 'foo'.  How to use them in order to get bar?

[10:06:04] <ryanneufeld> something that will show a countdown

[10:08:14] <ryanneufeld> Kwpolska: you need var in front of your projectList declaration
[10:08:31] <ryanneufeld> also
[10:08:38] <ryanneufeld> location.pathname
[10:08:48] <ryanneufeld> something is up with that
[10:09:18] <ryanneufeld> Kwpolska: open your JS console and type in location.pathname
[10:09:23] <ryanneufeld> and see what it contains
[10:09:30] <ryanneufeld> and you'll have your solution
[10:09:38] <ravenzz> Kwpolska location.pathname does not include the domain
[10:10:21] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: don't give him the answer!
[10:10:39] <ravenzz> Kwpolska also you should think in a non-js way

[10:17:06] <ryanneufeld> did you try what I suggested?
[10:17:06] <Kwpolska> ryanneufeld: I've been working on everything and the JS part of this is done.
[10:18:10] <ryanneufeld> Kwpolska: I'm sensing some broken english here, so the JS is the final part of your project you mean?
[10:18:28] <Kwpolska> ryanneufeld: not quite.

[10:22:41] <Kwpolska> (site menu, not run by anything JS)
[10:22:55] <ryanneufeld> RedOrigin: what you probably want to do is bind to the click event on the link, and use it's href with .load
[10:23:06] <ryanneufeld> What's broken?
[10:23:28] <RedOrigin> Yes! that sound totally right!

[10:26:16] <Kwpolska> ryanneufeld: just in case you do care: I had some problems with hilighting the active item.
[10:26:52] <ryanneufeld> That was abrupt
[10:27:07] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: o/
[10:27:24] <gnarf> ?
[10:28:55] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: hi
[10:29:00] <ryanneufeld> just saying hello
[10:29:03] <ryanneufeld> that's all
[10:29:43] <gnarf> oh - hi ;)
[10:33:25] <Whirl3d> is position() a read-only function? in other words, I can't use: $(item).position({top:40, left:40}) to change item's position relative to it's parent?
[10:33:41] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: use .css
[10:33:46] <ryanneufeld> for that
[10:34:04] <ryanneufeld> in fact, you can pretty much use it the exact same way
[10:34:07] <Whirl3d> Yeah, my code breaks when I use .css for that. UGG I hate css
[10:34:27] <ryanneufeld> $(item).css({'top':'40', 'left':'40'})
[10:34:32] <ryanneufeld> that should work just fine
[10:34:48] <ryanneufeld> chances are something is up w/ you css then
[10:35:18] <ryanneufeld> if you're having problems positioning, it could be that the parent container doesn't have a positioning context
[10:35:44] <ryanneufeld> so if item is positioned absoultely, you can put position relative on items parent
[10:36:04] <ryanneufeld> and item will be positioned absolutely within it's parent
[10:37:19] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: you get that?
[10:38:44] <Flam> if your markup/css is bad then it'll be hard to position properly.
[10:39:06] <Flam> if the parent element is block, set the inner element as absolute and then top/left/right/bottom should be fine
[10:39:19] <Flam> or relative actually
[10:39:31] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/VeRAL/27/
[10:39:35] <ryanneufeld> Flam: the parent needs to have a positioning context on it, or any top/bottom etc won't work
[10:39:35] <Whirl3d> so close...
[10:40:01] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: so many var.....
[10:40:18] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: why so many... that's what commas are for...
[10:40:44] <Flam> Whirl3d are you making a scrollbar?
[10:41:23] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: also have you looked into maybe using jquery-ui for this, you can limit the direction x or y of a draggable element with it
[10:41:51] <Flam> jquery ui is bloat and hard to work with imo (instant kick)
[10:42:22] <dross> lol
[10:42:33] <Whirl3d> unfortunately, I have looked into jquery UI and though I am sure it is brilliant, it's a bunch more shit to learn for a project that is WAY past due and I'm just nitpickiing do death
[10:42:35] <dross> you obviously haven't worked with bloated UIs
[10:42:56] <ryanneufeld> Flam: use extjs and then complain about jquery-ui
[10:42:59] <dross> though besides, there are better UI Javascript frameworks
[10:42:59] <ryanneufeld> :P
[10:43:01] <dross> like Dojo
[10:43:02] <Whirl3d> Plus, then I don't learn the basics
[10:43:20] <dross> xD extjs, what a joke
[10:43:21] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: okay, well I have a suggestion to help
[10:43:29] <dross> esp with the license drama
[10:43:33] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: set your scroll thumb to be positioned absolute
[10:43:39] <ryanneufeld> and then only change one of the positions
[10:44:07] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/VeRAL/29/
[10:44:07] <Whirl3d> I had it setup that way originally, but the CSS messed up then. With relative it's at least close
[10:44:09] <ryanneufeld> like that
[10:44:25] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: yeah, you were like 99% there dude
[10:45:47] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/VeRAL/31/
[10:45:56] <ryanneufeld> notice how I removed all the vas
[10:45:58] <ryanneufeld> *vars
[10:46:05] <ryanneufeld> and used commas
[10:46:11] <Whirl3d> ryanneufeld,I was just gonna ask about that. brb
[10:46:16] <ryanneufeld> k
[10:47:08] <Whirl3d> what else is different. If I change position:absolute, it breaks on my original script.
[10:48:03] <Whirl3d> my x position gets all whacky...
[10:48:44] <Whirl3d> ryanneufeld, thanks for taking the time to help with this. I really appreciate it.
[10:48:45] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[10:48:58] <thebignoise> does anyone know how to make the page not jump to the top after an ajax request? i did the preventDefault on the click but that didnt work
[10:49:16] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: notice I changed youre call to .css
[10:49:21] <ryanneufeld> I took out the left
[10:49:25] <ryanneufeld> as you don't need to set it
[10:50:01] <ryanneufeld> you only need to change the top, as you don't want it to move horizontally, only vertically
[10:50:17] <puppen> thebignoise: cant be sure, but've you tried returning 'false'..
[10:50:27] <thebignoise> yea
[10:50:33] <ryanneufeld> thebignoise: I usually do a return false , but If I could see your code I could tell you
[10:50:36] <ryanneufeld> ?p @ thebignoise
[10:50:37] <bot-t> thebignoise, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:51:11] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: you see what I'm saying?
[10:51:58] <thebignoise> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/f6Z2D/
[10:52:05] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: also, you're using the same variable name in two function scopes, this is dangerous as you are overwriting the reference to your original item, which might not be the best thing
[10:52:38] <Forbidd3n> I know there are many jquery File uploaders, but can't seem to find one that allows me to customize by placing a caption on the image prior to uploading. I am writing one myself that allows me to do this. Is the iframe method deprecated or is it still a good way to do it?
[10:52:51] <ryanneufeld> thebignoise: so you call tagSearch when you want to bind to .tag amirite?
[10:53:01] <Whirl3d> ryanneufeld, checking on that now. How do I adjust for the overlap when scrolled to the bottom. It appears that I need to compensate for margin-bottom, but not margin-top? Odd.
[10:53:19] <thebignoise> ryanneufeld: i think so im not sure i get what you mean?
[10:53:38] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: yeah, what you want to do is calc the heigh of the handle, and then figure out a max top value
[10:53:48] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: then you check for that value before setting top
[10:53:59] <ryanneufeld> Whirl3d: if it's higher, set it to the max
[10:54:13] <ryanneufeld> thebignoise: when does tagSearch get called?
[10:54:58] <thebignoise> $(document).ready
[10:55:02] <Forbidd3n> Anyone on the jQuery File upload question
[10:55:03] <Forbidd3n> ?
[10:55:12] <ryanneufeld> thebignoise: the reason it's scrolling to the top of the page is beacuse you're setting location.href to something with a fragment in it
[10:55:23] <ryanneufeld> Forbidd3n: uploadify
[10:55:26] <thebignoise> where at?
[10:55:41] <ryanneufeld> thebignoise: location.href = '/cq/tags/search/' + "#=" +
[10:55:59] <thebignoise> ryanneufeld: ah ok
[10:56:01] <ryanneufeld> thebignoise: that #= is gonna make the browser look forsomething with an id of "="
[10:56:05] <ryanneufeld> which doesn't exist
[10:56:12] <ryanneufeld> so it's gonna scroll to the top of the page
[10:56:18] <thebignoise> so i am going to have to do it differently
[10:56:21] <Forbidd3n> ryanneufeld: it appears to be too complex to simplify and add custom features to it
[10:56:35] <ryanneufeld> Forbidd3n: it's not bad once you get it setup
[10:56:50] <ryanneufeld> thebignoise: not sure why you're using a hash
[10:57:00] <Forbidd3n> ryanneufeld: I need to add custom fields with each image being uploaded
[10:57:04] <jita> what wrong with this function? It hides the datepicker calendar. http://dpaste.com/639824/. It is called as beforeShowDay: hightlight(date),
[10:57:07] <Forbidd3n> a caption for each image
[10:57:11] <ryanneufeld> Forbidd3n: postData is the field that you need
[10:57:25] <thebignoise> ryanneufeld: because there is a lot of clicks and i dont want to 'reload' the page every time
[10:57:53] <ryanneufeld> thebignoise: makes sense, my suggestion would be to use ajax
[10:58:01] <ryanneufeld> ?jquery.load() @ thebignoise
[10:58:03] <bot-t> thebignoise, .load() - Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/

[11:35:05] <rgr> (I have an issue where the return from an ajax call contains script elements and jquery is executing them before they are put into the dom)
[11:39:35] <Dave_Stein> rgr: if you are using .html to populate the dom, it will run as they are found
[11:39:46] <Dave_Stein> rgr: if you're doing that, make sure your scripts are placed at the bottom
[11:39:57] <rgr> these scripts are inside specific divs.
[11:40:09] <rgr> e.g a twitter embed
[11:40:20] <Dave_Stein> rgr: can you give a code sample on jsfiddle?
[11:41:23] <Dave_Stein> it sounds like you're not doin somethin right if you're bringing soemthing down that looks for elements that arent there and you have no control of the loading
[11:42:06] <rgr> not really but you can see what I mean here where in "edit mode" I edit that event containing the twitter embed and it saves vai ajax and returns the html to replace the twitetr element. The script itself it executed globally and the page just becomes a single embed until I "refresh" the page. If that makes any sense ;) http://shamrockirishbar.com/twitter
[11:42:14] <Forbidd3n> I know there are many jquery File uploaders, but can't seem to find one that allows me to customize by placing a caption on the image prior to uploading. I am writing one myself that allows me to do this. Is the iframe method deprecated or is it still a good way to do it?
[11:42:50] <rgr> inside the embed id is a twitter <script...> element which is returned.
[11:43:40] <rgr> when the ajax save returns the html i create a new element e.g newe=$(html) and then replace the #idXXX element.
[11:43:51] <Dave_Stein> Forbidd3n: iframe method always gave me more issues. A JS way will always be a file dialogue and that's it. You need to get the caption before / field next to upload button
[11:44:35] <Dave_Stein> rgr: unless there's any hooks to know that script is loaded you're not gonna have much luck
[11:44:45] <Dave_Stein> you can set an inteval that looks for the element to exist
[11:44:50] <Dave_Stein> and then clear interval when its found and run your stuff
[11:44:58] <rgr> I probably havent explained it properly.
[11:45:28] <rgr> its simply a case of replacing a DOM element with a new html chunk and that html chunk includes scripts which render embedded controls such as the twitter one.
[11:46:10] <Jaac> IM implementing google map directions on my site, and have been using an example to my likings form the web
[11:46:18] <Jaac> One part of the example, shows this code;
[11:46:19] <Dave_Stein> and when the twitter one runs, which of the elements does it look for that doesnt exist
[11:46:20] <Jaac> http://jsfiddle.net/7AM6y/
[11:46:57] <rgr> hmm looking further it seems it might be a twitter control only issue.
[11:46:58] <Jaac> Which includes some prototype.js, but i would love to make it jquery. COuld someone assist or point me in the right direction how to modify the code.
[11:47:04] <Peppr_> Question: if I was to loop the same live event ( exact same selector ) over and over, is .live appending to jQuery.event stack, or it is just overriding the previous $('selector').live function.
[11:47:22] <jita> why does not this gets executed, although i the values match when i print their value on console.log     if ($('#id_checkin').datepicker('getDate') == date) {       alert('yes');     }
[11:47:25] <jita> anybody please ?
[11:47:56] <Jaac> Ive seen it uses the observe function, which can be replaced with jquery's submit(), but i don't know if mroe code is prototype.
[11:48:09] <jita> the values match when i try to output it on cosole
[11:48:10] <Jaac> Any help is appreciated.
[11:48:21] <jita> but if condition does not catch it
[11:48:50] <Peppr_> Jaac: came in late to the chat group, what is it you are asking for help with.
[11:50:19] <Jaac> Hi Peppr_, im implementing directions into my site using the google maps api.
[11:50:34] <Jaac> Have been checking out an example on a dutch website (althoguh the code can be read in english)
[11:50:52] <Jaac> The thing is, one part of the code uses prototype, which i owuld love to change into jquery.
[11:51:00] <Jaac> But my knowledge on what is what is too little.
[11:51:13] <Jaac> This is the article; http://www.hackvalue.nl/nl/article/31/een%20google%20map%20met%20bedrijfslogo%20en%20routeplanner
[11:51:17] <Peppr_> Jaac: ok, you mentioned that is was in Prototype? and needed some help?
[11:51:29] <Jaac> This is the part of code im talking about; http://jsfiddle.net/7AM6y/
[11:51:52] <Jaac> The observe functions is definately prototype, and i can replace it with jquery's submit()
[11:52:05] <Jaac> But what about the rest of that peace of code.
[11:53:17] <Jaac> btw, im only implementing the javascript portion from the article inside the if (GBrowserIsCompatible()) statement
[11:54:25] <Peppr_> Jaac: the rest of the code simply takes the value from the form "Elm.routefrom.value" does a replace through regex, and appends the to: value to create the parameter that GDirections needs to work.
[11:55:27] <Peppr_> Jaac: what are you having trouble with, this should be easily ported since there internal code inside the observe function is not Prototype and should work if bound to the submit function.
[11:55:59] <Jaac> Hmm ok Peppr_, brb one sec..
[11:57:24] <Jaac> Peppr_: so the jquery part would only change like this; http://jsfiddle.net/7AM6y/1/
[11:59:03] <Jaac> What about the Event.element(e), does that become $(this).element(e) ?
[11:59:36] <Jaac> Im probably wrong, but im trying to understand. I have not much knowledge of javascript and prototype, althoguh have worked wiht jquery quite a bit.
[12:02:26] <Forbidd3n> Dave_Stein: you still there?
[12:02:39] <Dave_Stein> yeah i'm around, just working
[12:02:52] <Peppr_> Jaac: give me a sec please on a pm with someone else.
[12:02:58] <Forbidd3n> File Dialogue?
[12:02:58] <Jaac> For sure!
[12:03:08] <Dave_Stein> you know theu sual pick our files and upload thing
[12:03:13] <Dave_Stein> it'll never have another text field in it
[12:03:14] <Forbidd3n> You would have to select each file every time though, correct?
[12:03:22] <Dave_Stein> no?
[12:03:31] <Dave_Stein> explain your flow
[12:04:25] <Forbidd3n> I am wanting to add a caption, select file, click add and it adds it to the queue or add caption, select file and uploads automatically and adds to list below
[12:04:55] <Dave_Stein> you want to have user like upload 3 files, each one goes to a list so like when they're all done you have like a UL with 3 items
[12:04:58] <Dave_Stein> you can put the textfield there
[12:05:00] <Forbidd3n> with a delete options
[12:05:04] <Forbidd3n> option
[12:05:44] <abjorn> I could've installed 10 ubuntus in the time its taking me to install gentoo
[12:05:48] <abjorn> fuckin gentoo
[12:05:53] <Forbidd3n> Set Caption, Select File, Upload - It pushes it to a div where it is uploading the file with progress bar. And they can keep adding files to a max set amount
[12:05:55] <Dave_Stein> abjorn: haha my guys are hating centos
[12:06:08] <Dave_Stein> yeah that works too, just opposite direction
[12:06:11] <Dave_Stein> so what's the issue
[12:06:16] <abjorn> centos is fine
[12:06:18] <abjorn> for servers, anyways
[12:06:50] <Dave_Stein> not as good as ubuntu for installing shit so ive heard
[12:06:54] <Dave_Stein> apt get love crap ha
[12:07:27] <Forbidd3n> Dave_Stein: so what I was asking is - would the iframe idea work? I will write it myself to accommodate the custom options I am trying to do.
[12:07:37] <abjorn> it's the same shit
[12:07:46] <Forbidd3n> I think I will just have trouble with the progress bar
[12:07:54] <abjorn> from the user end, installing with apt-get and yum is basically the same
[12:08:01] <abjorn> just some package names are different
[12:08:41] <Dave_Stein> Forbidd3n you can do that the JS way, without a painful iframe
[12:09:06] <Forbidd3n> Dave, any examples you can push me to on the web?
[12:09:21] <Forbidd3n> so I can read over on what you are referring to?
[12:09:35] <Dave_Stein> the jsfileuploader demo
[12:10:11] <Peppr_> Jaac: here is a potential fix - hard to say without seeing the supporting html , but I think you get the picture.
[12:10:14] <Peppr_> http://jsfiddle.net/7AM6y/2/
[12:10:18] <Forbidd3n> Dave: link to it, please?
[12:10:23] <Dave_Stein> i gotta go, gotta pay attention to what im doin more, ill get ya link one sec
[12:10:27] <Forbidd3n> I googled and many ajax uploaders come up
[12:10:55] <Dave_Stein> http://github.com/valums/file-uploader
[12:13:04] <Jaac> Thanks Peppr_, Im going to try it out, can always give you the site through pm, if you don't mind.
[12:13:22] <Jaac> With my code, the retrun false; of the submit() will break, and do a page refresh
[12:13:38] <Peppr_> Question everyone: anyone have a good understanding of how .live is working in JQuery. I need to know if jQuery was smart enough to not override exact same code over and over again. i.e: $('#id').live("hover", function(){ alert('hovering') } ); $('#id').live("hover", function(){ alert('hovering') } ); would jquery know to ignore the next live bind since it is identical?? thoughts?
[12:14:25] <Peppr_> Jaac: sure give me a pm. I will see if I can help.
[12:20:22] <dabear> Peppr_: jquery does not ignore new event handlers
[12:20:32] <dabear> not bind .bind, not for .iive
[12:22:48] <Peppr_> dabear : so it is far to assume that .live just overwrites blindly? I would assume so for simplicities sake.
[12:24:10] <dabear> Peppr_: no overw
[12:24:17] <dabear> Peppr_: no overwriting
[12:24:30] <dabear> both handlers will be called
[12:27:33] <Peppr_> dabear: so in other words, in my example, once I hover over the anchor, I will fire 2 alerts?
[12:29:22] <Jaac> Thanks alot Peppr_ for your help, the directions from google's api get nicely inserted into the DOM!
[12:29:56] <Jaac> Couldn't have figured it out mysself :)
[12:31:50] <Peppr_> np, Jaac, we are glad we could help/
[12:33:06] <Peppr_> dabear : if that is true that would something I should bug JR about to put in the api doc on the jQuery site. That will more than likely stump a few coders along the way.
[12:36:02] <Peppr_> dabear: ouch. You were right...  http://jsfiddle.net/yQ8q2/
[12:38:31] <Peppr_> hmmm.... that forces the developers to be mindful of other live events for possible collisions. I guess that makes sense to a degree , but I feel that since the .live function uses selectors as a catalog it should be a bit more aware of duplications. Thoughts?
[12:54:52] <dabear> Peppr_: totally disagree
[12:55:26] <dabear> Peppr_: live and bind should not behave differently regardring multiple duplicate handlers
[12:59:44] <dabear> peper: you should also note that .live is just a wrapper to .bind . You can easily simulate event delegation (which is what .live does) with .bind
[13:00:06] <steve_web_cloud> Hi all, am I losing my mind? or is there no way to tell jQuery UI that for my "Tabs" I don't want it to even attempt to make an AJAX request?  I see requests go out for every tab click only to return 404's
[13:00:24] <dabear> ?demo @ steve_web_cloud
[13:00:24] <bot-t> steve_web_cloud, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:01:28] <steve_web_cloud> hmmm, guess I was hoping that there might be some known insight on this... I'm pretty sure I'd need to spend another hour just to extract a demo
[13:05:06] <Peppr_> dabear : I hear you, but live has a nice footprint in terms of performance instead of .bind thrashing elements. Mind you that you could argue that a strategically place .delegate statement on the parent element of children node could have the same effect, but I am fan of live and was just wondering.
[13:06:47] <dabear> live is actually worse than delegate in performance, because live requires a jquery object formed with a selector
[13:07:03] <BinaryKitten> ??
[13:07:19] <BinaryKitten> since when dabear?
[13:07:26] <dabear> which means that the dom is traversed once initially $("foo")
[13:08:06] <dabear> and then once more when the live handler is triggered
[13:08:47] <BinaryKitten> can you provide proof of this dabear
[13:09:27] <dabear> proof of what? you know that when you do $("foo bar baz"), the dom is searched
[13:10:14] <dabear> i.e. there will be results of 0 or more elements, which .live then ignores (as it used even delegation)
[13:12:04] <dabear> if you then do $("foo bar baz").live("click", function handler(){  })  the click is intercepted on the document, and then filtered against the initial selector
[13:13:17] <dogarrhea2> how to cancel drag on a child element whose parent was draggable()
[13:14:09] <wookiehangover> e.stopPropagation
[13:14:12] <wookiehangover> probably
[13:14:58] <BinaryKitten> want to know something funny dabear?
[13:15:09] <dabear> not really, no
[13:15:14] <BinaryKitten> delegate calls this.live
[13:15:26] <BinaryKitten> oh sorry,
[13:15:30] <dogarrhea2> wookiehangover: I am trying to do it the "jquery" way of binding some "drag" event
[13:15:39] <dogarrhea2> but somehwo the drag event never triggers..
[13:16:01] <wookiehangover> are you using jquery ui?
[13:16:57] <dogarrhea2> yes wookiehangover
[13:17:15] <dogarrhea2> maybe i can make the child element draggable and return false in the start function
[13:17:18] <dogarrhea2> seems like a hack though
[13:18:59] <dogarrhea2> ok that works
[13:19:54] <dabear> BinaryKitten: I might be wrong, but I think the livehandler sets initial search path to the this element, rather than document
[13:21:17] <dabear> anyway, the result is that its called only when triggered, not also when the jquery object is constructed
[13:22:55] <dabear> if that made any sense :p
[13:24:05] * BinaryKitten is reading the source
[13:25:48] <maltray> Hi, I wanna make a function to add messages (info, or error, whatever.) i already know how to do this, just not how to show it through css like the way i want it to be showed up, i want that the message box appear at the center, over the body (while the body animates to opacity: 0.4, or something like that ill think about it later), and like with margin-top:300px; is it possible to make it like
[13:25:48] <maltray> this?: #message { z-index:10; position: absolute; margin: 0 auto; margin-top:100px !important; } thing is, to do this i think i have to center it with jquery, any helps on that?
[13:26:42] <dabear> BinaryKitten: I'm pretty sure that the reasoning behind creating .delegate was to have an alternative to .live where you didn't have to run the same selector twice to both select ( initial jquery object, $(foo)) and filter(when the live handler is called on the document)
[13:27:37] <BinaryKitten> dabear no matter what, both have to do that initial dom search
[13:27:47] <Peppr_> dabear : hmm. I believe that .live was cleaned up after in 1.5 to not throw away and do the DOM search in the initial creation. I was under the impression for speed sake it was improved to keep a catalog of selectors and then validate events based upon .closest() thus firing .trigger() if the element had a bound live event. BinaryKitten, what that your impression as well?
[13:28:15] <dabear> Peppr_: .live does not do an initial dom search
[13:28:27] <ajpiano> BinaryKitten: dabear is right
[13:28:34] <steve_web_cloud> ok, back on my earlier question on how to get jQueryUI to **not** make an ajax call when clicking on other tabs I've made a fiddle that kind of explains my scenarios http://jsfiddle.net/7RUQ4/9/  I realize that after adding 2 tabs it all goes haywire... but with the console/firebug network tab open you can see that every tab click tries to call out to load a remote resource.... I just want to know
[13:28:34] <steve_web_cloud>  if there is a "noAJAX", "useLocal", or similar property/method that I can set/call that will tell jQueryUI that I have ZERO intention of doing anything with AJAX so please don't attempt to load anything.. ;-)
[13:28:37] <dabear> but when you do $("foo") <-- the dom is searched
[13:28:42] <dabear> .live comes after
[13:28:48] <ajpiano> the fact that it's called 'this.live' internally is immaterial
[13:28:48] <dabear> and uses this.selector to filter
[13:29:07] <BinaryKitten> ajpiano i know
[13:29:18] <dogarrhea2> is there a way to stop click propagation based on the color of what you clicked?
[13:29:18] * BinaryKitten was just having a small source joke
[13:29:19] <ajpiano> oh ok
[13:29:24] <ajpiano> ok
[13:29:27] <BinaryKitten> sorry
[13:29:39] <maltray> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/210717/using-jquery-to-center-a-div-on-the-screen
[13:29:40] <maltray> found it!
[13:30:42] <dabear> Peppr_: you are correct in assuming that live does validate events based on this.selector and closest(), but the fact is that you have to select an element before doing .live()
[13:42:36] <steve_web_cloud> has anyone built/used a "Tabs" plugin for jQuery that allows you to add tabs on they fly, using an "add tab" button/tab thingy that visually appears in their "tab set"? I find it fairly astonishing that this isn't commonly available...
[13:43:09] <steve_web_cloud> note: I'm not limited to jQueryUI... in fact due to issues, I may very well roll my own/use something else
[13:43:22] <simon> steve_web_cloud, that sounds useful. it's most likely part of larger graphical libraries that compile to HTMl5.
[13:44:03] <steve_web_cloud> maybe, but to me (personally) this would be a default option within tabs, if I supported the option to generate them on the fly
[13:49:08] <steve_web_cloud> crud... so much for getting this done by Monday....
[13:51:37] <dabear> steve_web_cloud: sorry, but RTFM ?
[13:51:42] <dabear> .tabs( "add" , url , label , [index] )
[13:52:29] <steve_web_cloud> yeah.... but the URL doesn't have to be remote
[13:52:56] <dabear> then use "#baz" for url
[13:53:07] <RedOrigin> hey how do I store an strings in an array with .data()?
[13:53:24] <steve_web_cloud> though the wording of the documentation on that could really, really be better phrased and/or provide an example
[13:53:45] <steve_web_cloud> I did try using #whatever for the url... doesn't help
[13:53:45] <dabear> agreed
[13:54:55] <RedOrigin> sorry, I meant "How do I store strings in an array with the .data()?"
[13:55:12] <dabear> steve_web_cloud: worked for me
[13:55:18] <dabear> $($0).tabs( "add" , "#test" , "label") worked from console
[13:55:56] <dabear> then do $("#test").append("<p>somecontents</p>")
[13:57:41] <steve_web_cloud> hmmm, ok, let me go back and test some stuff... its still messed up on my end, but I've got a pile more code than my sample
[14:01:55] <RedOrigin> nvrmind I think I figured it out.
[14:04:26] <eric_lewis> i'm trying to loop thru each element found with the class of block and work with the elements individually
[14:04:31] <eric_lewis> i'm using this right now
[14:04:32] <eric_lewis> $.each( $('.block'), function(block) { alert( block.html() ) });
[14:04:44] <eric_lewis> but the alert returns 0â€¦ what am i doing wrong in the syntax?
[14:04:59] <eric_lewis> also tried
[14:04:59] <eric_lewis> $('.block').each( function(block) { alert( block.html() ) });
[14:05:16] <ajpiano> eric_lewis: $(".block").each(function(i, el ) { $(this) // or $(el);  })
[14:05:22] <ajpiano> the first arg is the index in the loop
[14:05:24] <eric_lewis> mm!
[14:05:32] <eric_lewis> ah
[14:05:34] <eric_lewis> makes sense
[14:05:36] <eric_lewis> thanks!
[14:05:38] <ajpiano> and it's a dom element
[14:16:55] <Musician> anyone know good irc channel where i can got help form my html issue?
[14:18:14] <dabear> steve_web_cloud: here's how I did it
[14:18:15] <simon> Musician, #web?
[14:18:15] <dabear> http://www.screenr.com/aBGs
[14:19:53] <Musician> hmm, maybee ;D.  but maybe someone know why height: 100% is not working after float: right?
[14:20:46] <Forbidd3n> I know there are many jquery File uploaders, but can't seem to find one that allows me to customize by placing a caption on the image prior to uploading. I am writing one myself that allows me to do this. Is the iframe method deprecated or is it still a good way to do it?
[14:21:11] <steve_web_cloud> thanks @dabear - yeah adding it any which way shape or form is great, but to protect myself from future changes, I was intending to use the API's fully
[14:21:56] <steve_web_cloud> maybe I
[14:22:56] <steve_web_cloud> maybe I'm just tired.... I've been hacking at various aspects of this for a week, with nothing worthy to show for it.... had I known I would have had so much trouble, I would have wrote my own plugin and be done in 2 days.
[14:23:31] * steve_web_cloud disapointed with the abilities of jQueryUI thus far
[14:24:46] <Whirl3d> Jeesh, I hate asking for help in the #css channel. What a bunch o mean tards!
[14:25:15] <Whirl3d> Just wanted to thank the kind folks in this channel for being so genuinely helpful and not so mean
[14:25:36] <Hopsy> hey i have a question
[14:25:46] <pinogiu> salve
[14:25:47] <Hopsy> let's suppose i am using iframe
[14:26:15] <Hopsy> could the website i am fetching, see the referring/redirected website?
[14:27:18] <dabear> steve_web_cloud: what? that is the way to do it. so by your logic it is better to write it your self, than to rely on existing APIs because they can change? That just doesn't make sense
[14:29:06] <steve_web_cloud> what I mean is, I've been trying to get this tabs plugin (part of UI) to work for the better part of a week....  *if* I had just gone NIH, and wrote my own plugin that supported what I expected to be default functionality, I would be done in 2 days.
[14:29:46] <steve_web_cloud> I'm fine with API's changing, what I didn't want to do is some serious hacking outside of the jQueryUI API, such that later on if there are updates, it all falls apart
[14:31:31] <ajpiano> steve_web_cloud: not sure what you're having trouble with exactly
[14:32:05] <ajpiano> steve_web_cloud: the API for adding tabs is changing between 1.8 and 1.9
[14:32:09] <ajpiano> http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/03/tabs-api-redesign/
[14:32:20] <ajpiano> though both APIs will be supported
[14:32:20] <steve_web_cloud> ...I'm getting frustrated because (a) I'm surprised I can't find anyone else out there that has solved this... yet I see it as such a basic functionality desired by many. (b) attempting to get this to work in jQueryUI has led me around in circles, and I still have no workable solution
[14:32:32] <ajpiano> for what? adding a tab?
[14:34:23] <steve_web_cloud> yikes, looks like a big change.... damn... think I'm going to bail out of this ASAP based on those changes which seem to take the tabs widget even further in the direction that I'm not going
[14:35:13] <ajpiano> ok, yeah do what suits your development
[14:35:44] <steve_web_cloud> thanks for the help though guys... much appreciated...
[14:36:04] <rgr> whats the correct way to remove all script elements from a jquery element?
[14:38:08] <steve_web_cloud> guessing...   obj.find('script').remove();
[14:38:46] <steve_web_cloud> but I think that would only remove the nodes... any previously executed logic/defined functions/variables would still exist I believe
[14:42:03] <ryanneufeld> o/ ajpiano
[14:42:42] <ajpiano> heya ryanneufeld
[14:43:17] <ryanneufeld> gotta say, jquery ui, making me very happy right now
[14:44:07] <ajpiano> haha awesome
[14:44:39] <ryanneufeld> oh, and that lyrics share thing
[14:44:48] <ryanneufeld> got me big kudos from a high level Exec from CBS
[14:44:51] <ryanneufeld> who I work for now
[14:44:52] <ajpiano> OOh
[14:44:57] <ajpiano> that's awesome
[14:44:58] <ryanneufeld> cause the bought us
[14:45:02] <ajpiano> CBS owns a lyrics site now??
[14:45:06] <ryanneufeld> yes
[14:45:19] <ajpiano> interesting
[14:45:20] <ryanneufeld> http://cbsimg.com/our-products/
[14:45:25] <ajpiano> i always thought lyrics sites were not on the up and up
[14:45:33] <ryanneufeld> most aren't
[14:45:34] <ryanneufeld> we are
[14:45:53] <ajpiano> that's awesome
[14:46:05] <Hopsy> Can I use a live function for fireEvent http://blog.fgribreau.com/2010/08/jquery-fireevent-plugin-for-firing-real.html
[14:46:08] <ryanneufeld> I'm actually working on a chrome extension to show lyrics for music videos on youtube
[14:46:30] <ajpiano> that's fun, chrome extensions in general are pretty fun
[14:46:44] <ryanneufeld> yeah, they are fun, it's a different way of thinking for sure
[14:46:55] <ryanneufeld> everything is pub/sub
[14:47:11] <ravenzz> how do you synch the lyrics to the videos?
[14:47:18] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: I don't
[14:47:27] <ryanneufeld> I just show them in a widget beside the video
[14:47:50] <ravenzz> yep but how are they synchronized?
[14:47:59] <ryanneufeld> They aren't
[14:48:03] <ravenzz> lol
[14:48:25] <ryanneufeld> that would be karoke which we're not licensed for
[14:48:28] <Hopsy> fail!
[14:48:34] <ravenzz> I would do something similar, but without synchronization it is silly
[14:48:41] <ravenzz> ryanneufeld
[14:48:48] <ryanneufeld> go ahead
[14:48:57] <ryanneufeld> :)
[14:49:05] <ryanneufeld> if it's good, and you don't get sued
[14:49:09] <ryanneufeld> maybe we'll have a job for you
[14:49:29] <ravenzz> ahah
[14:49:35] <ryanneufeld> we're actually looking for some devs at the moment
[14:49:57] <ryanneufeld> but we're located in Vancouver, BC so not sure how many people on here are interested in that
[14:50:07] <ravenzz> http://musixmatch.com :o?
[14:50:42] <ryanneufeld> what about them?
[14:50:51] <dabear> ravenzz: it's not karaokee if you're not singing!
[14:51:09] <dabear> you can't prove I sing along on all songs I watch on youtube!
[14:51:36] <ryanneufeld> dabear: actually, according to gracenote, if the lyrics are synced to the song, it's kareoke
[14:51:41] <Hopsy> I dont get it :(
[14:51:50] <ravenzz> they deliver lyrics
[14:51:55] <Hopsy> why cant I bind fireEvent in live?
[14:52:06] <dabear> ryanneufeld: nah, the public doesn't agree
[14:52:17] <ravenzz> ryanneufeld oh so it is not possible to do karaoke?
[14:52:20] <ryanneufeld> dabear: the public won't sue us, gracenote will
[14:52:32] <dabear> why would gracenote care?
[14:52:49] <ryanneufeld> dabear: lyrics are copyrighted, you can't just share them
[14:52:54] <dabear> they sue because they don't want competition?
[14:52:56] <ryanneufeld> you need a license like music or video
[14:53:07] <ryanneufeld> we license our lyrics from gracenote
[14:53:16] <ryanneufeld> so we have terms that we need to follow
[14:53:30] <dabear> ryanneufeld: sure, but what is the difference between showing them, and syncing them with the video..
[14:53:34] <dabear> hm, ok
[14:53:57] <dabear> so what exactly does your company do?
[14:54:03] <Hopsy> ryanneufeld: is the eye of CBS not a part of reptilian illuminationcrap?
[14:54:13] <dabear> if you don't have any lyrics your self..
[14:54:15] <Hopsy> logo *
[14:54:16] <ryanneufeld> www.metrolyrics.com
[14:54:18] <ryanneufeld> we do
[14:54:21] <ravenzz> basically there should be a standard as the subtitles one
[14:54:24] <ravenzz> imo
[14:55:00] <ryanneufeld> Hopsy, I have no idea what you're talking about
[14:55:19] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: I don't know anything about subtitles
[14:55:33] <ryanneufeld> all I know is what I'm allowed and not allowed to do with the lyrics
[14:55:35] <Forbidd3n> how do you get a form to post the form to an iframe and not submit the form to another window at the same time?
[14:55:49] <ryanneufeld> and the fact that we are the largest legit site sharing them
[14:55:57] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: the one you links is purely an API
[14:56:02] <ravenzz> and license on lyrics are stupid...that make no sense to protect the lyric, why? :| I can write down one in minutes
[14:56:25] <ravenzz> ryanneufeld yep I didn't took a look at the developers page
[14:56:27] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: someone wrote them, shouldn't they get paid for it? We pay them
[14:56:34] <dabear> but can you write down several hundres lyrics in asensible amount of time your self?
[14:56:38] <ravenzz> I was thinking that they offer that for free
[14:56:51] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: no, it's $20,000 to start with
[14:56:55] <ravenzz> ryanneufeld yep you have to pay.
[14:57:03] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: we pay gracenote
[14:57:13] <ryanneufeld> different licenser
[14:57:17] <ravenzz> I saw it 2 minutes ago
[14:57:19] <ravenzz> k
[14:57:52] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: http://www.metrolyrics.com/rolling-in-the-deep-lyrics-adele.html
[14:57:53] <ryanneufeld> we can do that
[14:58:04] <ryanneufeld> and it costs you nothing
[14:58:06] <ryanneufeld> to look at them
[14:58:22] <ryanneufeld> however, we pay to be able to show them to you
[14:58:29] <ryanneufeld> any how
[14:58:29] <dabear> ryanneufeld: make a plugin to spotify instead. that's where I want to see lyrics
[14:58:35] <Forbidd3n> How do you get a form to post the form to an iframe and not submit the form to another window at the same time? I have the target in the form the same as the iframe name
[14:58:38] <dabear> not on freakin' youtube
[14:58:42] <ravenzz> oh yep I see
[14:58:43] <ryanneufeld> dabear: spotify isn't our problem
[14:58:48] <ryanneufeld> *partner not problem
[14:58:59] <ravenzz> ryanneufeld and.... how about those "autoscrollers" on tabs websites
[14:59:05] <ravenzz> are them synchronized?
[14:59:21] <ryanneufeld> not if they are legal
[14:59:38] <ryanneufeld> we had some before that just scrolled at a set speed
[15:00:34] <ryanneufeld> I'm not really in charge of the legal stuff, I just have some unfortunate rules I have to follow when dealing with them
[15:00:54] <ravenzz> but if you got a license you can synch them? or redestribuite them in order to be rewritten as subtitles?
[15:00:56] <ryanneufeld> Forbidd3n: you're still trying to do that ajax uploader eh?
[15:01:20] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: there is a license available for that yeah
[15:01:24] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: we just don't have it
[15:01:33] <ravenzz> i see
[15:01:38] <ryanneufeld> ravenzz: and there are some... creative... ways around it
[15:01:44] <ryanneufeld> that I'm going to be using in the chrome extension
[15:02:08] <ryanneufeld> It's stupid, and I can't tell you why (NDA) but I can only show five lines at at time
[15:02:17] <ryanneufeld> unless it's on our site
[15:02:31] <ryanneufeld> so I have to simulate it :p
[15:02:42] <ravenzz> egeh
[15:02:43] <ravenzz> eheh
[15:02:53] <Forbidd3n> ryanneufeld: I have to write a custom one since there isn't one out there with custom field options for each file upload
[15:03:02] <Forbidd3n> For example, a caption for the image
[15:03:10] <ryanneufeld> you know
[15:03:24] <ryanneufeld> what I've noticed a lot of sites do, is they do the uploads
[15:03:46] <ryanneufeld> and then show the images with an info form as they are uploaded
[15:03:52] <ryanneufeld> so you can save it
[15:04:05] <ryanneufeld> That's how flickr, and 500px do it
[15:04:24] <ryanneufeld> which is why I suggested the uploadify to you
[15:06:26] <Forbidd3n> ryanneufeld: that means the user has to do two different saves versus one
[15:06:31] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:06:32] <Forbidd3n> I have one that I am almost done with
[15:06:54] <Forbidd3n> they select the file, apply the caption and then click upload and it uploads it and then appends it to a div list
[15:07:23] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that's not bafd
[15:07:26] <ryanneufeld> *bad
[15:07:28] <ryanneufeld> nice UX
[15:07:47] <Forbidd3n> UX?
[15:07:54] <ryanneufeld> User eXperience
[15:08:15] <Forbidd3n> thanks, it is just a pita and ridiculous to have to reinvent the wheel
[15:08:46] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I think that's why no one really does it the way you're tryingto
[15:08:50] <ryanneufeld> it's "hard"
[15:09:21] <ryanneufeld> looking at uploadify, you can actually have it queue the files for you, but not upload them till you tell it to
[15:09:45] <ryanneufeld> then there is an onSelect method, which happens when you queue a file
[15:10:09] <ryanneufeld> you could use that to add a caption input for each of the images
[15:11:11] <ryanneufeld> then using the post data, and some clever JS, you can post the data with the images when you call uploadifyUpload()
[15:11:13] <ryanneufeld> oooh
[15:11:20] <ryanneufeld> I'm gonna totally do that!
[15:11:31] * ryanneufeld writes this shit down...
[15:18:33] <coldhead> PEOPLE OF EARTH
[15:18:38] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[15:18:43] <ryanneufeld> LOL
[15:18:56] <ryanneufeld> wb coldhead
[15:18:57] <eric_lewis> sorry i was asking about this earlier but i got confuzzed
[15:19:04] <coldhead> thanks ryry
[15:19:11] <eric_lewis> this is syntactically incorrect somehow:
[15:19:11] <eric_lewis> $.each( $(".block"),
[15:19:11] <eric_lewis>             function(i, el ) {
[15:19:11] <eric_lewis>                 el.html("new html");
[15:19:12] <eric_lewis>             }
[15:19:12] <eric_lewis>         );
[15:19:23] <coldhead> ?p @ eric_lewis
[15:19:23] <bot-t> eric_lewis, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:19:50] <coldhead> eric_lewis: i think you want $(el).html(...)
[15:20:48] <eric_lewis> i'm going to end up dealing with each .block element differently so i'm trying to put it in an each...
[15:21:07] <coldhead> right, each is the right approach then
[15:21:09] <eric_lewis> oh wait
[15:21:12] <eric_lewis> i see what you're saying
[15:21:32] <abjorn> sup coldhead
[15:21:34] <eric_lewis> ah :)
[15:22:49] <eric_lewis> wow that is kind of boggling my mind, you can put in dom element objects in the $() syntax
[15:23:45] <ryanneufeld> eric_lewis: it's magic
[15:24:58] <coldhead> eric_lewis: you can put pretty much ANYTHING in the $() and jQuery will work it out
[15:25:09] <eric_lewis> haha good to know
[15:25:11] <coldhead> you can even do this: $( $( $( el ) ) )
[15:25:16] <ryanneufeld> don't
[15:25:18] <coldhead> but don't ever do that
[15:25:18] <ryanneufeld> but you can
[15:25:34] <coldhead> jQuery is very considerate
[15:25:42] <abjorn> too considerate
[15:25:46] <coldhead> hi abjorn
[15:25:48] <ryanneufeld> I'm sure I about to ask a very "WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!" question
[15:25:49] <coldhead> happy sunday
[15:25:58] <abjorn> ya dawg
[15:26:14] <ryanneufeld> but is it possible to get the full file path of a file value from a file input?
[15:26:16] <abjorn> i've been spending such a large chunk of this weekend installing gentoo. why is it such a chore
[15:26:25] <ryanneufeld> abjorn: why?
[15:26:27] <abjorn> i finally did it but sooo not worth it
[15:26:37] <abjorn> just to see what all the fuss is about
[15:26:40] <ryanneufeld> abjorn: I ran it for 4 years
[15:26:45] <ryanneufeld> the fuss, isn't worth it
[15:27:02] <abjorn> that and the admin test at work to get promoted to a Linux Admin consists of installing gentoo
[15:27:08] <abjorn> even though we dont use gentoo, but its part of it
[15:27:17] <abjorn> at least now I know I *can*
[15:27:29] <ryanneufeld> it's fun, till you're in need of some feature that you didn't think of and then have to rebuild your entire toolchain
[15:27:37] <abjorn> rofl
[15:27:39] <abjorn> fuck that
[15:27:40] <ryanneufeld> no joke
[15:27:43] <ryanneufeld> it happens
[15:27:53] <abjorn> back to debian based distros for me
[15:27:56] <ryanneufeld> two tips, if there is a -bin version of something
[15:27:57] <ryanneufeld> use it
[15:28:05] <ryanneufeld> second, use ubuntu
[15:28:07] <ryanneufeld> lol
[15:28:10] <abjorn> lol
[15:28:14] <abjorn> I usually use mint, but same thing
[15:28:29] <abjorn> ubuntu with a fancier interface
[15:28:36] <ryanneufeld> gentoo "is for ricers" but when I ran it it was nice on my laptop
[15:28:56] <ryanneufeld> got me better battery life and such cause I actually understood what was going on
[15:28:58] <abjorn> yeah its on the admin test there so they know you know your shit
[15:28:59] <HektoR> Hello guys... is it possible to get html element by current scroll position ?
[15:29:00] <coldhead> interesting cultute you have there, abjorn
[15:29:05] <abjorn> cultute?
[15:29:13] <ryanneufeld> now I own a couple macs, and don't give a fuck
[15:29:14] <coldhead> CULTURE
[15:29:17] <ryanneufeld> it just fucking works
[15:29:21] <coldhead> don't toy with me, boy
[15:29:24] <abjorn> lololl
[15:29:29] <coldhead> abjoy*
[15:29:34] <ryanneufeld> HektoR: could you be more specific?
[15:30:05] <abjorn> ryanneufeld: I don't feel that dropping 1.8k is worth it, really. They look nice and I'd like to use them but not for that kind of cash.
[15:30:17] <ryanneufeld> mine was less than that
[15:30:33] <ryanneufeld> 13" mbp, ~1500
[15:30:36] <abjorn> plus im a game junkie, i gotta upgrade my hardware all the fuckin time...which ends up being more expensive in the long run, but my machine stays current
[15:30:45] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I don't use desktops
[15:30:52] <ryanneufeld> I'd never buy a mac desktop
[15:30:58] <abjorn> I used to use both until my laptop died
[15:31:03] <ryanneufeld> but for mobile, nothing i can find beats the battery life
[15:31:21] <ryanneufeld> and it's partially an image thing, the other part is I just like OSX
[15:31:29] <abjorn> for mobile I'd get a mac if it wasn't so much, I wouldn't want to spend more than 1k on a laptop
[15:31:37] <ryanneufeld> MBA
[15:31:42] <abjorn> fuck that
[15:31:48] <ryanneufeld> ?
[15:31:51] <abjorn> if i wanted a netboot I'd get an asus
[15:31:54] <abjorn> *netbook
[15:32:04] <ryanneufeld> yeah, they have some sexy ones coming out
[15:32:13] <abjorn> asus netbooks are pretty great
[15:32:16] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:32:31] <abjorn> don't really want a netbook though
[15:32:43] <abjorn> i had one for awhile, was lucky enough to get one of those free Cr-48's, but the screen broke
[15:32:48] <abjorn> and it's not worth replacing the screen
[15:32:50] <ryanneufeld> I have an actual question now, is it part of the JS security policy that you can't get the full source path of a file upload?
[15:33:06] <coldhead> i believe so, ryanneufeld
[15:33:06] <ryanneufeld> how'd you like the cr-48?
[15:33:09] <abjorn> yeah
[15:33:11] <coldhead> the client isn't supposed to care
[15:33:13] <abjorn> it was nice
[15:33:15] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: thx, that's why I thought
[15:33:46] <ryanneufeld> I had a cool idea, but I think the only way to do it is either two step, or java applet
[15:33:56] <abjorn> or magic
[15:34:02] <ryanneufeld> magic is too hard
[15:34:11] <ryanneufeld> and last time I tried I curse my neighbor
[15:34:19] <ryanneufeld> turned his wife into a goat
[15:34:26] <abjorn> not for ben_alman it isn't
[15:34:30] <ryanneufeld> unless I just saw something unfortunate...
[15:34:40] <abjorn> awww imsky isn't here to share in the meme
[15:34:49] <abjorn> the forced meme that only me, him, and coldhead know about
[15:35:17] <ryanneufeld> k
[15:35:27] <engaged> How come I can't put a span in an <option>? How do I change the text of <option>s then?
[15:35:29] <ryanneufeld> well, that's.. you know... cool and all
[15:35:37] <ryanneufeld> engaged: you can't
[15:35:40] <Duffleman> Howdy, How do I use jQuery to count every checked checkbox in a specific column in a table?
[15:35:45] <engaged> you can def change option text
[15:35:47] <engaged> ive seen it done
[15:35:49] <engaged> just cant figure out how
[15:35:53] <dabear> engaged: simple, you don't do that
[15:36:02] <ryanneufeld> engaged: it probably wasn't what you think it was
[15:36:04] <abjorn> why would you need a span in it to change th text?
[15:36:06] <engaged> i have a field for shipping
[15:36:08] <engaged> rush or standard
[15:36:13] <engaged> and it displays the amount
[15:36:17] <engaged> which varies based on quantity...
[15:36:21] <engaged> i need to update it
[15:36:42] <ryanneufeld> engaged: http://www.dfc-e.com/metiers/multimedia/opensource/jqtransform/
[15:36:44] <abjorn> $("option.whatever").text("blablabla")?
[15:36:56] <abjorn> idk
[15:37:01] <abjorn> you could just rebuild it
[15:37:07] <ryanneufeld> oh, you wanna change the contents of the option, not the styling of it?
[15:37:21] <engaged> yes
[15:37:22] <engaged> the contents
[15:37:27] <ryanneufeld> ah, then what abjorn said
[15:37:39] <abjorn> ?text
[15:37:40] <bot-t> .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[15:37:41] <ryanneufeld> $("option").text()
[15:37:41] <engaged> i tried, <option>123 <span id="test"></span></option> but i cant modify that id="test"
[15:37:51] <ryanneufeld> you can't put spans in options
[15:37:58] <abjorn> why do you need a span in there
[15:37:59] <engaged> can i put a div?
[15:38:02] <ryanneufeld> no
[15:38:02] <abjorn> no
[15:38:05] <ryanneufeld> only text
[15:38:07] <abjorn> you can't put anything but text
[15:38:12] <abjorn> and you don't *need* to put anything but text
[15:38:16] <ryanneufeld> well, you can put three things in there
[15:38:23] <ryanneufeld> text, nothing, and text
[15:38:25] <engaged> how can i choose which option - i have 2 of them
[15:38:26] <abjorn> lol
[15:38:43] <ryanneufeld> engaged: using a selector I would imagine
[15:38:48] <abjorn> <option class="option1">Something</option>
[15:38:55] <ryanneufeld> class is one way
[15:39:01] <abjorn> $("option.option1").text("NEW TEXT OMG");
[15:39:05] <engaged> thanks
[15:39:08] <engaged> i will try that
[15:39:09] <abjorn> np
[15:39:10] <ryanneufeld> if you know it's the second one all the time
[15:39:20] <Duffleman> Howdy, How do I use jQuery to count every checked checkbox in a specific column in a table?
[15:39:28] <ryanneufeld> you can do $("option").get(1).text()
[15:39:30] <dabear> stylign form elements is generally bad, as browsers dont support it (in the same way)
[15:39:38] <coldhead> $('table :checked').length
[15:39:46] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: ++
[15:39:59] <Duffleman> Would that not count every checkbox in the table? Rather than just the column
[15:40:02] <dabear> ?beer @ coldhead
[15:40:02] <bot-t> coldhead, ?good
[15:40:18] <ryanneufeld> Duffleman: no
[15:40:31] <ryanneufeld> ?:checked @ Duffleman
[15:40:31] <bot-t> Duffleman, :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[15:40:37] <Duffleman> How do I specify which column it counts then?
[15:40:56] <ryanneufeld> put class on all the check boxes in that column
[15:41:12] <ryanneufeld> then you can use $('col4 :checked').length
[15:41:14] <dabear> $('table tr:nth-child(2) :checked').length
[15:41:15] <ryanneufeld> for example
[15:41:20] <ryanneufeld> dabear: NO
[15:41:27] <ryanneufeld> don't use nth-child
[15:41:29] <ryanneufeld> so slow
[15:41:37] <dabear> your mom is slow, but I still use her
[15:41:54] <ryanneufeld> my mom has cancer, and is dying you fucking a-hole
[15:41:54] <Duffleman> loool
[15:42:02] <Duffleman> I'll try it out, thanks guys
[15:43:48] <coldhead> he only used your mom to make a tasteless joke
[15:44:01] <abjorn> how dare you use my mother to make a tasteless joke
[15:44:25] <coldhead> you have #jQuery's sympathy, ryanneufeld
[15:44:41] <coldhead> my mom is dying dabear, you may use her instead
[15:44:48] <coldhead> make her last moments happy ones
[15:45:01] <ryanneufeld> however brief
[15:45:56] <ryanneufeld> well, it's been fun, but I gotta go do a thing with some people IRL
[15:46:06] <dabear> coldhead: thx
[15:54:27] <Duffleman> Worked, thanks everyone: dabear + 1, coldhead + 1, ryanneufield + 1, abjorn + 1, bot-t + 1!
[15:54:39] <abjorn> lol
[15:55:06] <dabear> dualcore: I don't think a computer cares if you give it a one up or not
[15:55:33] <dualcore> what?

[15:55:39] <dabear> dualcore: not you
[15:55:40] <dabear> sry
[16:13:45] <ddoom_> I have a onclick event on a checkbox, and another statement that triggers the event on the checkbox. It seems when it triggers the 'checked' attr that returns from the onclick is the original, not what it should be after a click is triggered?
[16:14:05] <Forbidd3n> looking at line 340, how would I append another form field to this type of data string? - https://github.com/codler/jQuery-Ajax-Upload/blob/master/index.html
[16:15:12] <Axsuul> Anyone know what the best way would be to create an overlay div that I can use to click off and hide a menu?
[16:16:56] <dabear> ddoom_: try using the change event rather than the click event
[16:17:30] <dabear> and also use this.checked rather than $(this).attr("checked")
[16:18:28] <ddoom_> dabear: ok thanks
[16:21:05] <RedOrigin> I'm trying to figure out how to stare all div ids with a specified prefix into an array and then have index 0 be a click to load index 0 of another array into a specified div.
[16:21:22] <RedOrigin> I meant store
[16:23:34] <dabear> RedOrigin: break that up into somethinf I can understand plz.
[16:23:41] <RedOrigin> sorry about that
[16:24:17] <dabear> an event on the array element should load another arrays element into it self?
[16:25:11] <RedOrigin> no...
[16:25:25] <RedOrigin> I'm trying to reword my question.
[16:26:27] <coldhead> good luck
[16:26:32] <dabear> so you have a set of elements with prefixes, stores into a jquery object?
[16:26:38] <dabear> stored
[16:27:16] <Forbidd3n> if this example I have has in the ajax post, data: ':file' - how would I convert that to an array so I can pass more to data
[16:27:18] <dabear> clicking those divs, should load something from somewhere into where?
[16:27:27] <Forbidd3n> This is the plugin I am using - https://github.com/codler/jQuery-Ajax-Upload/blob/master/index.html
[16:27:46] <RedOrigin> I have a bunch of divs that have an id with a prefix of ft, and another bunch with a prefix of fv, I want to have jquery make it so that every time ft with index 0 is clicked it loads fv with index 0 into a div container
[16:29:26] <RedOrigin> and ft index 2 to load fv index 2 and so on for everyone.
[16:29:32] <Forbidd3n> anyone that can look, please?
[16:29:41] <js_node> hi,
[16:31:12] <RedOrigin> by the way thanks for the help.
[16:31:58] <dabear> var $fts = $("div[id^=fts]"), $fvs =4("div[id^=fvs]"); $fts.click( function(){   $fvs.eq(  $fts.index(this) ).appendTo("#container")  }  )
[16:32:15] <dabear> fix any errors your self :p
[16:32:29] <sk8ball> i'm trying to use the reveal modal popup plugin, and it shows the box for a second and then it closes immediately
[16:32:31] <RedOrigin> Awesome! Thanks dabear you're the best!
[16:32:36] <sk8ball> idea why that might happen?
[16:32:59] <js_node> i want to add colors to the texts http://webchat.freenode.net/
[16:33:15] <dabear> RedOrigin: now was that so hard to figure out your self?
[16:33:31] <RedOrigin> a little Q.Q
[16:34:19] <js_node> i want to add colors to the texts of every line, the first 10 characters
[16:34:32] <js_node> is that possible?
[16:36:09] <js_node> dabear: coloring texts for the first 10 charcters of every line, is tht possible, http://webchat.freenode.net/
[16:36:19] <js_node> http://jsfiddle.net/jxWWu/1/
[16:36:58] <dabear> js_node: it is possible. and no I have no idea how to do that
[16:37:16] <dabear> js_node: I buddy of mine knows how though
[16:37:35] <js_node> who is that buddy?
[16:38:05] <dabear> his name is G. Oogle
[16:38:13] <dabear> here's his web site: http://lmgtfy.com/
[16:38:37] <RedOrigin> bet he got made fun of a lot in school
[16:38:53] <RedOrigin> Oogle is kinda a weird name...
[16:40:02] <ylluminate> tried a couple of jquery css sprite based image hover/rollover effect tutorials and really wasn't pleased with the results.  wanted to get some votes on what may be the "best" tutorial in some of your opinions (had some compatibility issues with the ones I did)
[16:40:15] <js_node> dabear: http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/pseudoelement-firstletter
[16:40:28] <js_node> does this kind of support jquery has?
[16:40:33] <dabear> RedOrigin: yep, we punched him with bold letters all the time. but he just took it :/
[16:40:54] <RedOrigin> -.-
[16:41:30] <dabear> js_node: sigh, if YOU DONT KNOW how to do this, then either google it, don't do it, or use a premade solution
[16:41:34] <dabear> don't do it your self
[16:42:40] <dabear> there are many syntax hilighters out there. there are also plenty editors. and if you have styling issues, #css is the right place
[16:43:15] <RedOrigin> thanks again for the help I'm off to go learn my variables, right this time.

[17:00:42] <Forbidd3n> How do you get the multiple file names from an input type file in jquery
[17:02:03] <Forbidd3n> nv,
[17:02:05] <Forbidd3n> nvm
[17:21:31] <SkyFlyer> quick question.  I have two jQuery(document).ready() functions in my page, the first one initializes a variable the second one needs to use that variable but i get undefined?  how can I use the variable in the first ready inside the second one?
[17:26:53] <Forbidd3n> When I have target set on form and post to that iframe target it posts the form and not to the targeted iframe. Why would that be?
[17:29:06] <thebignoise> $('#drop').slideDown('slow');
[17:29:06] <thebignoise> $('#drop_content').empty();
[17:29:06] <thebignoise> alert('reached');
[17:29:29] <thebignoise> for some reason the slidedown works and i get the alert but the empty isnt working any ideas?
[17:35:52] <Forbidd3n> Anyone, please... How to submit a form to an iframe? I added target to the form which was the same as the iframe name and id, but redirects form after submit anyways
[17:44:36] <duubor> hey there. is there an easy way to implement static methods in a widget factory plugin?
[17:46:04] <duubor> or any plugin for that matter?
[17:51:39] <thebignoise> is it possible to pass a PHP array to a js function?
[17:53:06] <bcessa> hi, question, I'm trying to set a property to animate using a variable like .animate( var1: 500 ) and I keep getting the following error message "Expected an identifier but found '.' instead" any ideas on how to do it right? thnx
[17:54:36] <Forbidd3n> Anyone, please... How to submit a form to an iframe? I added target to the form which was the same as the iframe name and id, but redirects form after submit anyways
[17:56:11] <bcessa> Forbidd3n: why not use AJAX instead?
[17:58:56] <Forbidd3n> bcessa: I can't but you have to use an iframe to be able to post files to a php on the same page. Unless you have a different option. Not third party, I need custom options on it.
[18:00:37] <bcessa> maybe this can help http://forums.devshed.com/php-development-5/submit-form-to-iframe-in-same-page-510807.html
[18:01:59] <Forbidd3n> that was back in 2008, I am sure jquery has changed a lot since then and probably won't work without older version of jquery
[18:02:11] <duubor> hey there. is there an easy way to implement static methods in a widget factory plugin?
[18:02:34] <Forbidd3n> also, I am using an iframe just as they are
[18:03:13] <Forbidd3n> when I set the target of the form to the iframe name, it is posting to the url on th form, instead of the iframe. If I put the target on the form statically, then it works
[18:03:27] <Forbidd3n> only when I dynamically add the target to the form does it not work'
[18:06:19] <Forbidd3n> bcessa: ideas?
[18:06:40] <bcessa> did you read the link I send you?
[18:07:13] <bcessa> Forbidd3n: http://forums.devshed.com/php-development-5/submit-form-to-iframe-in-same-page-510807.html
[18:07:22] <Forbidd3n> yes, I did
[18:07:30] <Forbidd3n> way before you gave it to me
[18:07:31] <Forbidd3n> hehe
[18:08:25] <bcessa> no luck?
[18:08:28] <Forbidd3n> I am doing what that says, just setting the target dynamically not statically
[18:08:30] <Forbidd3n> no
[18:10:31] <Forbidd3n> bcessa: ideas?
[18:10:50] <bcessa> not really, sorry
[18:11:28] <bcessa> are u adding the target on the form to the iframe name as they suggest?
[18:12:00] <ussher_> Im having trouble locating the cause of jquery ui not changing some buttons.  The issue can be see on sales page for the skin i bought here http://maestro.n8flash.com/John_Guitar/  click on the icons under "Tracks".  Jquery ui will change the input button into an icon for only some of the tracks.  How can I understand why this is happening?
[18:12:01] <Forbidd3n> yes, dynamically
[18:13:14] <bcessa> ok, sorry man, can't think of something else
[18:18:25] <Forbidd3n> FormData doesn't work in all browsers, does it?
[18:26:17] <ryanseddon> no
[18:26:42] <ryanseddon> http://caniuse.com/#search=FormData
[18:28:48] <Forbidd3n> ryanseddon: any luck with my question on dynamically setting a form target to an iframe id
[18:29:06] <coldhead> such hard questions :(
[18:29:57] <Forbidd3n> coldhead: NO WAY. In The Flesh! You are the man...
[18:30:00] <ryanseddon> Forbidd3n: I haven't been following the conversation so i'm not even sure what you're talking ahout
[18:30:12] <Forbidd3n> Would you mind giving me a hand, p-l-e-a-s-e-e-e-e-e?
[18:31:05] <Forbidd3n> coldhead: I was looking for a plugin, but none that I can find allow me to post custom fields of the form as well as the file upload. For example a image caption.
[18:31:21] <Forbidd3n> So I am trying to create my own simple ajax file uploader with a hidden iframe
[18:31:33] <Forbidd3n> unless there is a better way
[18:31:47] <ryanseddon> have you looke http://www.plupload.com/
[18:32:11] <Forbidd3n> Yep, no custom fields to be posted
[18:32:20] <Forbidd3n> just files
[18:32:45] <Forbidd3n> coldhead: please say your still there, you always have the best solutions and help. :)
[18:33:15] <duubor> what's the conventional way to include a dependency in a jquery plugin?
[18:33:48] <coldhead> Forbidd3n: i don't think an iframe file uploader is as simple as you hope
[18:33:57] <coldhead> if it is simple for you then you know much more than i do
[18:34:15] <coldhead> i would use plupload or uploadify or blueimp's file uploader
[18:34:25] <coldhead> which let you send additional data with the file
[18:34:30] <coldhead> or files*
[18:34:33] <Forbidd3n> coldhead: it works in everything but FF, FF opens the post in a new window on submit even if a target it set
[18:34:36] <Forbidd3n> works in IE7+
[18:34:53] <coldhead> so you're almost there!
[18:34:54] <coldhead> good work!
[18:34:59] <Forbidd3n> except for FF
[18:35:07] <coldhead> yeah thats rough
[18:35:15] <coldhead> i know very little about iframes unfortunately
[18:35:18] <coldhead> i fear them
[18:35:29] <Forbidd3n> any other better idea without iframe
[18:35:36] <coldhead> the plugins
[18:35:38] <Forbidd3n> there is no other way to do it with ajax
[18:35:42] <Forbidd3n> they are using iframes as well
[18:36:28] <Forbidd3n> plupload.com, doesn't allow you to set a caption for images
[18:37:35] <coldhead> they are using iframes BUT they shield you from having to know about this crap
[18:37:38] <coldhead> which is why i like them
[18:38:08] <Forbidd3n> coldhead: I agree, but none have custom data fields to be posted with file
[18:38:13] <Forbidd3n> for example, image caption
[18:39:40] <abjorn> You would that that, if sorting 500,000 integers takes 1.8 seconds in something, sorting 1,000,000 integers would take 3.6 seconds...apparently not so
[18:40:32] <abjorn> well, probably because Go has a segmented stack that grows as needed, an 1mil just makes that grow waayyy too much
[18:40:35] <ProLoser|Mobile> hallo
[18:40:41] <ProLoser|Mobile> i'm having some weird behavior with this js http://jsfiddle.net/XWEKJ/
[18:40:56] <ProLoser|Mobile> see, when you click on a row, the checkbox should toggle, however links and inputs should NOT toggle the checkbox
[18:40:59] <ProLoser|Mobile> yet it's still doing so
[18:41:02] <ProLoser|Mobile> what-do?
[18:42:48] <ProLoser|Mobile> http://jsfiddle.net/XWEKJ/1/
[18:45:09] <Dantman> ProLoser|Mobile: You just delegated to the table rows... since the links are in the table rows the link clicks bubble up to it... if you don't want that to happen you should add another delgated event to the `tr a`s in there and use e.stopPropagation(); to stop the click event on the a's
[18:45:38] <ProLoser|Mobile> that would stop the effect, but it would not stop the other binder event
[18:45:51] <ProLoser|Mobile> plus, i want the links/inputs TO behave normally, just not the binder code
[18:45:58] <Dantman> huh?
[18:46:05] <ProLoser|Mobile> s/binder/binded
[18:46:09] <ProLoser|Mobile> fucking lion
[18:46:18] <ProLoser|Mobile> clicking on a link should behave normally
[18:46:27] <ProLoser|Mobile> it should NOT change the class of the row or check the box
[18:46:43] <Dantman> Then stop the bubbling of the event as I said
[18:46:43] <ProLoser|Mobile> it's a minor nuisance though
[18:46:51] <ProLoser|Mobile> e.preventDefault() does that?
[18:47:04] <Dantman> No, e.stopPropagation();
[18:47:28] <Dantman> e.preventDefault(); stops the native behaviour (ie: following the link)
[18:47:41] <ProLoser|Mobile> ahhhh
[18:47:42] <Dantman> e.stopPropagation() stops the event from bubbling to parent elements
[18:47:44] <ProLoser|Mobile> i didn't see that
[18:47:46] <ProLoser|Mobile> awesome
[18:47:54] <ProLoser|Mobile> like this? http://jsfiddle.net/XWEKJ/2/
[18:48:11] <ProLoser|Mobile> shweet
[18:48:13] <ProLoser|Mobile> danke
[18:50:26] <ProLoser|Mobile> worked beautifully
[18:50:41] <duubor> what's the conventional way to include a dependency in a jquery plugin?
[18:51:44] <ProLoser|Mobile> dependency?
[18:51:50] <ProLoser|Mobile> like another js lib or something?
[18:52:14] <ProLoser|Mobile> shouldn't you just assume the file is included and specify it's requirement in the docs?
[18:59:17] <duubor> proloser: is that the best way to do it?
[18:59:22] <duubor> yeah another lib that the plugin needs to use
[19:00:09] <duubor> i also just found $.getScript(). not sure if that would get cached the same way a <script> would?

[21:27:08] <dogarrhea2> so many bugs :(
[21:33:37] <Whirl3d> not a bug. you need to stop propogation

[22:47:07] <trumpetmic> Double_Rainbow: that sounds evil!
[22:47:29] <coldhead> Double_Rainbow: $('a').click(function () {return false; })
[22:47:51] <baheer> I am using this photo gallery, I need to replace the caption of image with Facebook Like plugin, which is place inside a span
[22:48:13] <baheer> and the image caption is place in <a href=#" title="Captio">
[22:48:21] <baheer> does any one can help me please?

[23:16:18] <SlexAxton> ?boom
[23:16:18] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[23:16:25] <coldhead> i kinda wanted to see where he was going with that
[23:16:40] <ryanseddon> aww I wanted to see the rest of the ascii picture
[23:17:09] <dytrivedi> baheer:  "then I drank some coffee and bill clinton screwed monica and it is coldhead's first day in jquery and gandhi wore a pyjama"
[23:17:23] <dytrivedi> baheer: understood?
[23:17:46] <baheer> No
[23:17:58] <dytrivedi> THAT IS HOW YOUR QUESTION IS
[23:18:19] <baheer> It means it is not clear
[23:18:35] <dytrivedi> and disjoint
[23:18:43] <baheer> how should you describe it,
[23:19:13] <baheer> Okay,
[23:19:15] <dytrivedi> how are you trying to use a gallery plugin to insert a facebook like button
[23:19:38] <dytrivedi> write some coads on your own
[23:19:50] <baheer> The question is something else, let me describe by details,
[23:21:32] <baheer> This gallery has a jQuery plugin that can display the image as lightbox, and the caption for each image is place inside of title attribute of <a> tag
[23:21:55] <baheer> I want to insert the Facebook Like button instead of this caption
[23:22:27] <baheer> although Facebook has giving me the code for this button in a <span> tag
