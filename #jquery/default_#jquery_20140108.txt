[00:24:46] <anli__> Is firebug having graphics artefacts or should I blame something else, for instance my graphics card drivers?
[00:25:03] <anli__> The window redrawal is really buggy
[00:25:28] <Cork> anli__: might be your gpu
[00:25:35] <Cork> depends on the artifacts
[00:25:36] <anli__> ah, ok
[00:26:04] <anli__> For instance, I get the desktop background as content of the window, must move the window around a bit, and if I am lucky, I get the intended contents
[00:26:32] <Cork> desktop background?
[00:26:37] <anli__> wallpaper
[00:26:54] <Cork> ah sorry read wrong
[00:26:57] <anli__> :)
[00:27:02] <Cork> in the firebug window?
[00:27:09] <anli__> yes
[00:27:18] <anli__> Seems like it does not receive repaint events when I should
[00:27:35] <Cork> (this should be taken in #firefox instead)
[00:27:54] <anli__> ok
[00:28:06] <anli__> Well, I know you are a firefox/firebug user, so :)
[00:28:28] <Cork> ya, but it is way off topic for #jquery
[00:28:41] <anli__> true true
[00:28:48] <Cork> and this will need to be researched to find the cause
[00:29:04] <anli__> yeah
[00:29:12] <anli__> Its totally annoying, moving the discussion to #firefox
[00:31:53] <fabioportieri> morning
[01:07:38] <fabioportieri> what are those tags?  {% and %}
[01:11:30] <Uhkis> asp?
[01:13:36] <Whirl3d> anybody know off-hand how to include foundation icons in jsfiddle.
[01:16:20] <seutje> Whirl3d: go to the raw link on github and replace raw.github.com with rawgithub.com
[01:19:02] <seutje> actually, don't even need to do that for images, the mime-type is correct anyway
[01:22:11] <Whirl3d> seutje, thanks for replying. Should I be using a different url and adding it as a resource? https://github.com/zurb/foundation-icons/blob/master/foundation_icons_general_enclosed/fonts/general_enclosed_foundicons.svg
[01:22:51] <seutje> Whirl3d: yeah, for SVG's you do need to change it to rawgithub.com
[01:23:17] <seutje> note that this service should only be used for quick demos and use-case examples for bug reports and the likes
[01:23:29] <seutje> like, don't use this as a CDN for production servers
[01:24:00] <seutje> Whirl3d: actually, the additional resources pane is only for JS/CSS
[01:24:21] <seutje> for SVGs you can just reference them as you normally would, but to the full URL (as rawgithub.com)
[01:25:57] <ghostlines> ahoy, I have a draggable and when I set revert to false the stop event doesn't seem to get triggered. It seems only to get triggered if revert is set to true. How can I work around this?
[01:26:15] <Whirl3d> It's turning out to be a real pain in the ass for something that is supposed to be so great. I give up.
[01:30:57] <Whirl3d> seutje, thanks for your help. What a terrible waste of 1.5 hrs just to put pretty pictures on buttons. Bah! Gnite
[01:31:10] <seutje> ghostlines: can't seem to reproduce: http://jsfiddle.net/YM9g2/
[01:37:02] <ghostlines> seutje: thx, I can't seem to reproduce it either. I'll do some more troubleshooting
[01:58:08] <hellothere> Hey yolo there http://jsfiddle.net/VMzNL/ got this thing there, what i need to do is make my on click function if it returns true once, to actually return true once and then disable the button do the die and val change
[01:58:11] <hellothere> any help ?:D
[01:58:17] <hellothere> love u smuuuush
[02:04:05] <Cork> hellothere: is this for a form?
[02:04:33] <Cork> also live isn't supported anymore
[02:04:33] <seutje> $.fn.die is removed, isn't it?
[02:04:44] <Cork> ya
[02:04:50] <Cork> it was removed the same time as live
[02:04:55] <hellothere> ye but i am using an older version of jquery
[02:05:10] <Cork> hellothere: what version?
[02:05:14] <seutje> yeah, if this is a form, you prolly wanna catch the submit event on the form, not the click on the button
[02:05:17] <hellothere> 1.4
[02:05:26] <seutje> whoa
[02:05:34] <Cork> ouch
[02:05:42] <hellothere> well we are modifying a CMS
[02:05:48] <hellothere> so u cant change the jquery version
[02:05:53] <seutje> did that even have live?
[02:05:57] <seutje> what CMS?
[02:05:59] <hellothere> unless u have the time to go through millions and billions of problems
[02:06:13] <hellothere> its a custom made thing for a big company
[02:06:15] <seutje> oh
[02:06:16] <Cork> ya, live was added in 1.3 if i remember correctly
[02:06:23] <hellothere> but when it was made it took like 2 years and 40 devs..
[02:06:47] <hellothere> think that the files in visual studio are like 80k scripting files..
[02:06:55] <hellothere> so ye i dont wanna touch the version of jquery ahhaa
[02:06:59] <seutje> :P
[02:07:00] <hellothere> u get my meaning :)
[02:07:21] <seutje> so... is this for a form?
[02:07:34] <hellothere> well id like some help on how to actually catch the submit event and not the click?
[02:07:34] <seutje> to like prevent duplicate submission or something?
[02:07:43] <hellothere> yes it is a post on a forum button
[02:07:52] <hellothere> let me post on fiddle
[02:07:55] <seutje> $('form').bind('submit', fn)
[02:07:56] <hellothere> the form
[02:08:09] <seutje> instead of $('form input.save').bind('click')
[02:08:26] <seutje> not sure if submit bubbles up properly for $.fn.live
[02:08:31] <seutje> or at least if it did in that version
[02:08:32] <Cork> hellothere: something like this should work http://jsfiddle.net/VMzNL/1/
[02:08:53] <seutje> We’re very proud to count some addtional events amongst those supported by live(). 1.4 introduces cross-browser support for change, submit, focusin, focusout, mouseenter, and mouseleave via the event delegation in .live().
[02:08:56] <Cork> though if you used submit on the form it should just work without doing anything fancy to the button
[02:09:08] <seutje> guess u can use live with submit without issues in 1.4
[02:09:16] <Cork> ya
[02:09:38] <hellothere> let me check, btw thx on this :) i rly love sometimes the help from community
[02:09:44] <hellothere> I myself aint that familiar with jquery
[02:09:48] <seutje> I was about to go all "prop!" on you, Cork, but then I realized... :P
[02:09:59] <Cork> :)
[02:10:06] <Cork> prop didn't exist back then
[02:10:28] <Cork> hellothere: http://jsfiddle.net/VMzNL/2/
[02:10:32] <Cork> this is hoe i would do it
[02:10:52] <Cork> hoe==how
[02:11:33] <hellothere> ye thing is i didnt wanna touch the form
[02:11:41] <hellothere> cause it actually has 90 lines of code in it
[02:11:47] <hellothere> and it hasnt been written by me...
[02:11:59] <Cork> well if you disable the submit button the submit event won't fire
[02:12:06] <Cork> on the form
[02:12:23] <Cork> so that should just work
[02:12:37] <hellothere> well i am gonna try the 1st fiddle u sended to see
[02:13:11] <seutje> Cork: u can still submit a form with disabled buttons, can't you? http://jsfiddle.net/k9p9m/
[02:13:25] <seutje> just hit enter in the textfield
[02:13:36] <Cork> doesn't work here
[02:13:58] <Cork> ugg
[02:14:00] <seutje> weird
[02:14:05] <Cork> but chrome doesn't block it >_<
[02:14:12] * Cork hits webkit
[02:14:24] <seutje> them chromesies...
[02:15:49] <hellothere> well the 1st fiddle u sended http://jsfiddle.net/VMzNL/1/
[02:15:51] <hellothere> doesnt work
[02:16:16] <Cork> what doesn't work?
[02:16:27] <hellothere> thing wit hthe form is that its like $('div.main').bind('input.submit', 'click', function (e)
[02:16:34] <hellothere> thats when the form starts its not with live
[02:17:06] <Cork> uh what?
[02:17:12] <Cork> bind('input.submit', 'click',) ?!?
[02:17:38] <Cork> that isn't a valid bind syntax
[02:17:49] <Cork> well actually it is, but a bit weird
[02:18:00] <Cork> it binds the input event with a submit namespace
[02:18:11] <Cork> and sends the string 'click' as data to the evevnt
[02:18:14] <Cork> *event
[02:18:21] <Cork> i doubt that is what you want to do
[02:20:07] <Cork> hellothere: http://jsfiddle.net/VMzNL/3/
[02:23:31] <hellothere> yep bare with me a second
[02:23:54] <hellothere> ill give u the actual code within the jquery i know its frustrating :D sorry cork for that, rly appreciate ur help
[02:26:19] <pacmac> good morning
[02:27:12] <pacmac> I'm looking for a function like slidedown, but I want to specify the exact point where it must stop sliding, not the time it must slide.. are there any function to do this?
[02:28:13] <hellothere> http://jsfiddle.net/T22Tj/ here u go cork sorry for the time it took i was just renaming some variables :)
[02:29:37] <Cork> pacmac: there isn't one
[02:29:43] <Cork> pacmac: you would have to use animate
[02:29:58] <Cork> or a plugin that uses animate :)
[02:30:54] <Cork> hellothere: as the html structure is missing the extra code doesn't really help
[02:31:36] <hellothere> thing is there isnt actually an html function i mean its short of created through asp
[02:31:51] <pacmac> cork, well, I think I didn't explained it good, sorry.. forget slidedown. I have a div container that has more divs into it, each div has a name and surname.. I have another div container, that has one div per each letter in the alphabet. I want that one I click in one letter, the other div containing the names and surnames, goes to the first div that the name begins with this letter
[02:32:01] <Cork> hellothere: there is, the server code generates html
[02:34:09] <hellothere> here u go i added what comes out from its html
[02:34:17] <hellothere> i mean what is generated
[02:45:40] <hellothere> the onclic of course should generate that massive jquery text ;D
[02:58:41] <vishal_> hey hi, how to stop execution of form submission on invalid input?
[03:08:25] <seutje> vispillo_: $('form').on('submit', function(e) { if (cond) { e.preventDefault(); } }); where cond reflects the validity
[03:09:07] <seutje> or delegate it higher if the form itself is a dynamically injected element: $(document).on('submit', 'form', fn)
[03:31:36] <kpl> Currently I have the following in my css file: #tablecontent>div {float:left;}   However I want the first div to be on its own line, which means I should not have float:left for all the divs like now. Using jQuery I guess I could limit which divs to set the style to, using "not"? Could I do that also directly for the css?
[03:35:09] <ravenzz> kpl #tablecontent > div + div { float: left; }
[03:39:41] <ThoMe> hiho
[03:39:50] <ThoMe> how i can select a element in a other frame?
[03:39:52] <ThoMe> i try with: $('#o').$('#menuWaehlenEmpfaenger').val('test');
[03:39:54] <ThoMe> but doesnt works
[03:40:00] <ThoMe> frame has the name/id: o
[03:40:30] <ravenzz> is the frame's domain the same as the parent one?
[03:40:56] <ThoMe> yes.
[03:42:06] <kpl> ravenzz: thanks
[03:42:44] <ravenzz> ThoMe $('#iframeid').contents().find('#menuWaehlenEmpfaenger').val('test')
[03:43:12] <ravenzz> $('#iframeid').contents() is the iframe's content document
[03:43:17] <ravenzz> kpl yw
[03:43:31] <ThoMe> ravenzz:
[03:43:40] <ThoMe> this: var frameOben = $('frame[name="o"]', top.document)[0].contentDocument; $(frameOben).contents().find('#menuWaehlenEmpfaenger').val('test'); works
[03:43:51] <ThoMe> but  $('#o').contents().find('#menuWaehlenEmpfaenger').val('test'); not
[03:43:55] <ThoMe> ravenzz: can you help? :-)
[03:44:15] <ravenzz> well #o is an id selector
[03:44:41] <ravenzz> try $('iframe[name="o"]').contents().find('#menuWaehlenEmpfaenger').val('test'); not
[03:45:14] <ravenzz> -not :)
[03:45:50] <ThoMe> hm. no. $('iframe[name="o"]').contents().find('#menuWaehlenEmpfaenger').val('test');  doesnt workx. but no error
[03:46:33] <ravenzz> try console.log($('iframe[name="o"]').length)
[03:46:54] <ravenzz> what do you get?
[03:47:14] <ThoMe> 0
[03:47:19] <ravenzz> there you go
[03:47:25] <ThoMe> not a iframe.
[03:47:27] <ThoMe> is a frame
[03:47:33] <ravenzz> oh well
[03:47:41] <ravenzz> frame[name="o"] th en
[03:47:46] <ThoMe> but var frameOben = $('frame[name="o"]', top.document)[0].contentDocument; $(frameOben).contents().find('#menuWaehlenEmpfaenger').val('08003301000');
[03:47:49] <ThoMe> thx :-)
[03:47:52] <ThoMe> works also
[03:48:25] <ravenzz> by the way the frame element is deprecated in hmtl5
[03:48:36] <ravenzz> html*
[03:49:01] <ThoMe> oh. ok :-)
[03:52:51] <Lope> this is not working. any ideas? $('.frmblah').attr('data-touched','1');
[03:53:25] <ravenzz> Lope console.log($('.frmblah').length)
[03:56:35] <Lope> ravenzz: thanks for the tip! ;)
[03:57:25] <Lope> how can I dump the contents of the collection?
[03:57:37] <Lope> like, see a list of all the ID's of those elements?
[04:00:03] <Lope> cool, figured it out with .each
[04:00:15] <ravenzz> $('.foo').map(function () { return this.id; });
[04:00:38] <Lope> yet setting the attribute is not working. any ideas?
[04:01:01] <Lope> the console.log showed me the 8 elements that were found, yet their attributes were not set.
[04:02:02] <Lope> oh it seems attr is read only?
[04:02:31] <lugzer> hello
[04:02:55] <seutje> Lope: can you reproduce it in an isolated fiddle or something? it should apply the attribute to the whole collection afaik
[04:04:20] <Lope> the help for attr() only says "gets" not "sets" http://api.jquery.com/category/attributes/
[04:04:29] <Lope> it seems prop() is needed to set an attribute.
[04:04:55] <Lope> hmm, prop is not working either.
[04:05:59] <xec> Lope: what are you really trying to do?
[04:06:29] <xec> Lope: is there some third party script readin the data attributes?
[04:06:33] <xec> reading*
[04:07:41] <lugzer> i have an input:text field acting as a jQ-UI datepicker, and i wanted to add another event when that input field is clicked (which shows the datepicker). seems that datepicker() doesn't have such event, and adding it independently doesn't seem to have a result. is it possible to do it?
[04:07:47] <xec> Lope: the native way to work with data-* attributes in javascript is using the dataset property: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement.dataset
[04:08:15] <xec> (note the horrible support in IE though)
[04:12:03] <lugzer> ok.. yet again, asking a question helped me solve it myself ;) too complicated to explain. thanks
[04:14:12] <xec> Lope: anyway, the syntax you used should work if what you really do want is to set the *html attribute* http://api.jquery.com/attr/#attr2
[04:18:29] <ThoMe> hiho
[04:18:43] <ThoMe> i have a inputfield and i would like on enter run a function.
[04:19:13] <ThoMe> but the input field has vales (firefox has saved example, history). when i select with the cursor key and press enter for select this
[04:19:40] <ThoMe> hm.
[04:20:16] <fabioportieri> what's the question?
[04:20:44] <ThoMe> fabioportieri: hm, my englisch.. hm
[04:23:19] <fabioportieri> ThoMe: $(input#id).keypress(function(e) {     if(e.which == 13) { //run your function here } });
[04:24:42] <grafi> row row row you boat
[04:25:43] <fabioportieri> $("input#id")
[04:26:36] <ThoMe> fabioportieri: yes. but when i have history entries in my input text field and select this with cursor and press enter
[04:26:58] <ThoMe> then doesnt works
[04:27:20] <ThoMe> hm. forget
[04:27:22] <ThoMe> sorry :-)
[04:27:39] <fabioportieri> no prob
[04:31:32] <ravenzz> anyone good at performances optimization?
[04:33:41] <grafi> performance optimization engineer extraordinare
[04:33:42] <grafi> oô
[04:33:54] <ravenzz> :)
[04:34:53] <fabioportieri> avoid sizzle...
[04:34:57] <ravenzz> ?
[04:35:03] <grafi> whaaaaat
[04:35:07] <fabioportieri> ahah
[04:35:32] <fabioportieri> .find is faster than using descendants in sizzle, for instance
[04:37:20] <Cork> uh
[04:37:28] <Cork> fabioportieri: that depends
[04:37:38] <Cork> sizzle doesn't normally have anything to do with that
[04:37:54] <ravenzz> I have a huge list of html elements that is animated (slideDown/Up) and it is quite slow
[04:37:55] <fabioportieri> what do you mean?
[04:37:55] <seutje> all the qSAs!
[04:38:34] <seutje> fabioportieri: it offloads .find to querySelectorAll, for the most part
[04:38:37] <ravenzz> graduateland.com/jobs the country one
[04:38:37] <Cork> fabioportieri: when you select descendants it's just handed over to document.querySelectorAll
[04:39:00] <fabioportieri> indeed find is faster
[04:39:14] <seutje> depends on the structure, rly
[04:39:19] <Cork> $('#target div span a') => document.querySelectorAll('#target div span a')
[04:39:31] <Cork> fabioportieri: and find is the same thing as $() in this context
[04:39:44] <fabioportieri> so when sizzle acts?
[04:39:46] <Lope> seutje: ok I will make a fiddle. xec: just want to set the data attribute on all elements with that class.
[04:39:57] <seutje> oh I thought he meant going all .children().children().children()
[04:40:02] <ravenzz> fabioportieri when you wanna do weird stuff or as polyfill
[04:40:14] <fabioportieri> ravenzz: weird stuff?
[04:40:25] <seutje> fabioportieri: non standard selectors for instance
[04:40:27] <Cork> fabioportieri: sizzle is acting on .not .filter and the like
[04:40:45] <Cork> fabioportieri: it loops the results returned from querySelectorAll and merges them
[04:40:48] <reuf> my page starts to load in IE9 and towards the end of loading left-side menu it stops and doesnt load the rest of the page - how can i find out what block loading of my page in ie9?
[04:40:52] <Cork> it also adds the support for :<function calls>
[04:41:02] <Cork> like :first and the like
[04:41:06] <Cork> :input
[04:41:09] <fabioportieri> ah yes
[04:41:36] <fabioportieri> that's bad for performance ^
[04:41:37] <Cork> it used to make a lot of compatibility for ie
[04:41:41] <xec> Lope: but to what end? :) why
[04:41:42] <Cork> but it isn't supporten anymore
[04:41:46] <Cork> fabioportieri: not really
[04:41:55] <Cork> it just loops and builds an array from the second array
[04:41:59] <fabioportieri> pseudoselectors and long chain of descendants
[04:42:06] <Cork> but yes the : calls are bad
[04:42:06] <xec> Lope: i expect you might be able to just use jquery's .data() method instead
[04:42:51] <ravenzz> my first idea is to remove each country's regions to reduce the dom elements
[04:44:05] <fabioportieri> this comes to my mind now http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/
[04:44:17] <ravenzz> infact I already tried that but I didn't get huge performances improvement
[04:48:28] <Lope> xec: I have a script I've written that pulls those values
[04:48:54] <Lope> http://jsfiddle.net/p2Lgd/1/ I've reproduced the code in a fiddle, but it works as expected. however .data() does not seem to work.
[04:49:20] <xec> if you write with .data() you have to read with it as well
[04:49:24] <seutje> Lope: .data doesn't change the attribute but stores a reference internally
[04:49:43] <seutje> it avoids unnecessary DOM manipulation
[04:49:46] <Lope> seutje: that explains why data() it can store any JS type.
[04:49:55] <Lope> seutje: so it's faster?
[04:49:59] <seutje> yes
[04:50:24] <Lope> seutje: how does jQuery tie the internal data value to the DOM element? what happens if you delete the DOM element?
[04:50:44] <seutje> Lope: it ditches the reference afaik
[04:51:25] <seutje> thing to keep in mind is that if there is no internal data object for that element, but there is a corresponding data attribute on the element, it'll grab that
[04:51:28] <Lope> what happens if your DOM element has no ID etc?
[04:51:43] <seutje> jQuery secretly assigns IDs to all elements irc
[04:51:45] <seutje> iirc
[04:52:01] <seutje> you can easily see this in IEs developer tools
[04:52:27] <Lope> using firebug, I don't see any IDs?
[04:52:47] <fabioportieri> he meant internal ids
[04:53:06] <Lope> but jQuery is just a library, it must access the DOM element using JS?
[04:53:12] <seutje> nosir, I believe them being exposed in IE is a workaround
[04:53:27] <Lope> unless firebug is designed to hide the jQuery created IDs
[04:54:56] <fabioportieri> Lope: jquery doesn't set ids on the dom, it set them internally as an hashmap
[04:55:04] <fabioportieri> i think from what seutje said
[04:55:13] <Lope> so how does it find the DOM elements?
[04:55:52] <fabioportieri> with a reference mechanism like an hashmap or something i think
[04:56:05] <Lope> for in this fiddle, there are no IDs so how do you reference the 3rd input for example? http://jsfiddle.net/p2Lgd/1/
[04:56:10] <Lope> without jQuery
[04:56:36] <fabioportieri> with css?
[04:56:43] <Lope> no with javascript
[04:56:50] <seutje> u can use any css selector
[04:56:53] <seutje> like nth-type
[04:57:03] <Lope> how?
[04:57:14] <Lope> with JAVASCRIPT
[04:57:18] <seutje> $('.foo:nth-type(1)')
[04:57:32] <seutje> errrm, 3 lol
[04:57:40] <seutje> nth-type is 1-indexed fyi
[04:57:56] <xec> 13:56 <Lope> without jQuery
[04:57:56] <xec> ;)
[04:58:10] <seutje> oh
[04:58:11] <xec> document.querySelector() ? :D
[04:58:12] <seutje> lol
[04:58:26] <seutje> document.querySelectorAll('.foo:nth-child(3)')
[04:58:29] <Lope> querySelector is not available in a lot of browsers, and it's very slow.
[04:58:34] <seutje> wait, did I write nth-type earlier?
[04:58:37] <xec> slow? who says
[04:58:40] <seutje> Lope: lol?
[04:58:42] <seutje> FINE
[04:58:56] <seutje> var foo = document.getElementsByClassName('foo')[2];
[05:00:10] <xec> Lope: you're in the wrong channel if you want non-jquery code ;)
[05:00:22] <seutje> and even IE8 does qSA
[05:00:34] <xec> yeah, and ie7 = dead
[05:00:48] <seutje> granted, it has quirks, but mainly related to not updating dynamic selectors
[05:01:26] <seutje> can't go wrong with getElementsByClassName, I suppose
[05:01:32] <fabioportieri> what's qSA ?
[05:01:41] <xec> querySelectorAll
[05:01:48] <fabioportieri> ahh thx
[05:02:08] <Lope> xec: science says it's slow http://jsperf.com/queryselectorall-vs-getelementsbytagname
[05:03:05] <xec> Lope: you're comparing two entirely different methods. getElementsByTagName is not able to select what you want...
[05:03:57] <Lope> xec, with a little function it can
[05:04:13] <xec> Lope: then you need to compare including that "function"
[05:04:43] <xec> of course if you're looking for all elements of a given tag name, of course getElementsByTagName will be a lot better
[05:04:59] <xec> - one of the "of course"
[05:07:16] <xec> Lope: besides, "slow" is a very relative term. 99% slower than really really really quick is still really quick, if you get my drift ;)
[05:19:37] <seutje> Lope: also: "I have a very complex page (ASP.NET, SharePoint 2010 SP1, Master Page is involved) that contains cascading filters, and I must iterate through 4000-5000 divs. By using querySelectorAll I am able to get runtimes of about ~20-30ms while the getElementByTagName is executing in 200-300ms."
[05:25:49] <seutje> Lope: another thing to note is that when using getElementsByTagName, you will usually have to loop over the results to do additional matching, and then your performance gain goes to poop: http://jsperf.com/queryselectorall-vs-getelementsbytagname/76
[05:26:47] <seutje> using getElementsByClassName and then matching the node type would be slightly more efficient, but the basic problem remains
[05:31:02] <Fraz> hi
[05:32:23] <Fraz> i'm trying to use getScript on a js file that defined an object and methods, but i can't seem to access the code in the file. any idea why?
[05:33:15] <Cork> Fraz: are you running the code that depends on it in the callback?
[05:33:30] <Fraz> oh, no
[05:33:37] <Cork> there you go :)
[05:33:42] <Fraz> ok thanks:)
[05:33:53] * xec hugs Cork
[05:33:55] <Cork> you'r trying to use the object before it's loaded
[05:34:03] * Cork snuggles
[05:35:17] <seutje> awwww
[05:46:41] <Lope> seute xec: interesting http://jsperf.com/queryselectorall-vs-tagname-and-classname
[05:49:35] <Whirl3d> Good morning folks, could someone explain why my tabindex isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/Hfv6K/7/
[05:52:55] <Whirl3d> doh! got it, thanks though.
[06:01:06] <seutje> Lope: now change the markup to actually reflect a realistic use case
[06:01:14] <seutje> BAM, results change entirely
[06:01:30] <seutje> rinse/repeat/give up on micro optimisations
[06:02:02] <Lope> yeah, chrome 30 is quite fast. I think the big difference was in older browsers.
[06:02:22] <Lope> Well, there is a huge gain there when the class does not exist, but it's an unlikely use case.
[06:03:39] <Lope> back to my original code, I'm finding that when I set data-touched with attr() and then read it afterwards using getAttribute() it reads back as expected. but not showing up in firebug.
[06:04:31] <Lope> hmm, problem must be elsewhere.
[06:06:08] <Lope> okay, problem solved :)
[06:06:26] <Lope> wasn't even a jQuery problem.
[06:07:02] <seutje> might be a firebug issue, shows up fine in chrome devtools
[06:07:14] <wa5ted> grafi: you up?
[06:08:46] <seutje> kinda funny ur perf testcase uses the "unperformant for-loop
[06:09:24] <seutje> I'ma just leave that can of worms right here, all opened and stuff :D
[06:14:33] <Fraz> how do you access a property of an instance from a method when using oop?
[06:15:23] <Cork> Fraz: instance.property
[06:15:25] <fabioportieri> Obj.getProperty()
[06:15:29] <Cork> if the value is actually on the object
[06:15:33] <Fraz> sd_slider.prototype.init_slider = function(){ // do something with the instance }
[06:15:36] <fabioportieri> sorry wrong chan
[06:16:00] <Cork> Fraz: var obj = new sd_slider(); obj.init_slider()
[06:17:12] <Fraz> yeh, im doing that. i set an id in sd slider(id) (this.id = id), but when i alert this.id in init_slider it's undefined
[06:17:12] <Whirl3d> I am trying to replace the placeholder functionality on input forms and can't get it to go away: http://jsfiddle.net/Hfv6K/22/   any idea what I am doing wrong>
[06:20:04] <Fraz> nm fixed it
[06:22:35] <Whirl3d> Even though I do $('input').data("placeholder",inp.attr("placeholder")).removeAttr("placeholder"); the placeholder attr remains
[06:23:27] <jomofcw> Hello !
[06:23:36] <jomofcw> Happy new year jQuery ^^.
[06:24:14] <jomofcw> PLease, is there an easy way (error free) to test if the data received from an AJAX request is JSOn or HTML ?
[06:25:41] <dogmatic69> jomofcw:  jQuery.parseJSON()
[06:26:11] <dogmatic69> stick it in a try / catch and you are good to go.
[06:28:38] <raj> shoky, cuz jqui 1.10 has jq 1.9 recommended for the cdn on the bottom http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10
[06:29:36] <jomofcw> dogmatic69 thanks !
[06:37:30] <seutje> Whirl3d: "paceholder" !== "placeholder"
[06:37:54] <seutje> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/Hfv6K/30/
[06:38:14] <wa5ted_> grafi: ?
[06:41:20] <Whirl3d> Seutje, thanks. I just reorganized things and it works. I really appreciate your help. What a foolish mistake.
[06:42:05] <seutje> Whirl3d: don't beat urself up, couple days ago, I was wondering why window.requestAnimationFame() wasn't working
[06:42:05] <jomofcw> Is it correct to write this : json_resultat.general.informations[0].id ?
[06:42:17] <seutje> sure
[06:42:18] <jomofcw> The question is about the "[0].id".
[06:42:23] <Cork> it is
[06:42:27] <seutje> although I wouldn't localize the variable name :P
[06:42:43] <jomofcw> xD
[06:42:46] <jomofcw> OK, thanks =).
[06:42:55] <Cork> ya none english variable names sucks
[06:43:31] <Cork> seen one that used japanese... that hurt...
[06:43:52] <seutje> had to review a PHP framework once, thing was entirely in spanish
[06:43:54] <jomofcw> So the error is on another thing :/.
[06:43:54] <jomofcw> I'm working with french team mate only :x.
[06:43:54] <jomofcw> Sorry :/.
[06:43:59] <seutje> my one weakness... how did they know?
[06:44:06] <fabioportieri> seutje: was it yii ?
[06:44:11] <seutje> I don't even remember
[06:44:20] <seutje> blocked it out to prevent traumas from onsetting
[06:44:28] <fabioportieri> cause i encountered a yii module all spanished
[06:45:15] <seutje> but do you speak it?
[06:45:47] <fabioportieri> not at all!
[06:46:23] <seutje> I should probably pick it up some time
[06:46:44] <fabioportieri> i speak italian fluently though
[06:49:07] <seutje> neat, I'd be quicker to pick up spanish though, seems more useful globally
[06:49:12] <Whirl3d> I get by with google translate. LOL
[06:49:47] <seutje> last time I went to CA, I noticed it's really useful to understand spanish around those parts
[06:50:14] <seutje> but I guess speaking italian is nice to go to NYC and call out the Guidos :D
[06:50:29] <fabioportieri> that's because italian is my first language ehe
[06:50:29] <Whirl3d> The way it's going in the US, it would be wise to learn Chinese...if not for now, soon.
[06:50:32] <fabioportieri> guidos ?
[06:50:40] <seutje> NYC wannabe italians
[06:51:02] <fabioportieri> ohh
[06:51:37] <fabioportieri> guido is an italian name too
[06:53:11] <Lope> <div><input><ul></ul></div> lets say I have $ul which is a jQuery reference to the ul. how do I get a reference to the input?
[06:53:56] <fabioportieri> the same way you did with ul
[06:54:10] <Lope> oh. its siblings().
[07:05:52] <seutje> fabioportieri: yeah, that's prolly where the derogative term came from
[07:18:49] <enzo> Hello
[07:20:15] <enzo> I need to make several ajax calls (but I don't know the number, it's an array of ajax calls), and wait for all to finish. I've tried var calls = [], calls.push(function () $.ajax(...)) several times, then $.when(calls).done(...), but it doesn't seem to work
[07:20:21] <enzo> any idea ?
[07:22:03] <Cork> enzo: $.when.apply(null, calls).done()
[07:22:15] <seutje> enzo: when expects a number of comma separated arguments, not an array, use apply
[07:22:19] <seutje> damnit Cork
[07:23:08] <seutje> enzo: also, happened to make this example for someone less than a week ago: https://gist.github.com/seutje/8237468
[07:23:21] <fabioportieri> another italian, or assassin creed fan
[07:23:49] <Cork> hmm anyone know of a way to find the smallest unit one can make without causing decimals?
[07:24:07] <enzo> ok thanks seutje, still doesn't work, I look deeper in my code
[07:24:14] <seutje> fabioportieri: you mean enzo? he's French, I think
[07:24:16] <Amnesia> question, <table class="form subform" id="myTable"> in conjuction of "$("#myTable").append('<tr>...</tr><tr>...</tr>');" should do the job right..?
[07:24:37] <seutje> enzo: calls.push(function () $.ajax(...)) -> calls.push($.ajax(...))
[07:24:52] * enzo is frenchy, has never played to assassin creed :)
[07:25:07] <seutje> Amnesia: needs a tbody?
[07:25:27] <seutje> or needs to check for one
[07:25:34] <Amnesia> seutje: well,I somehow want to add a row to the table
[07:25:46] <seutje> you don't wanna end up all <table><tbody></tbody><tr></tr></table>
[07:25:47] <Amnesia> seutje: the table already contains <tbody>....</tbody>
[07:25:57] <Amnesia> agreed
[07:25:59] <seutje> Amnesia: so append it to the tbody instead of the table?
[07:26:08] <enzo> thanks for correction seutje, now works like a charm
[07:26:10] <Amnesia> let me have a look how:)..
[07:26:52] <seutje> keep hearing rumours of charms working, but my rabbit's foot never does anything :(
[07:27:29] <Amnesia> seutje, <tbody id="myTable">  + "$("#myTable").append('<tr>...</tr><tr>...</tr>');" ?
[07:28:39] <NoiseEee> Amnesia: $(tbodyReference).append('<etc>')
[07:29:36] <Amnesia> so without the "'s around "myTable" and no pound sign right?
[07:30:06] <gho5tjr> Where is the documentation for the "input" event
[07:30:16] <seutje> `g html spec input
[07:30:18] <b-ot> seutje: Forms in HTML documents → http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html

[07:30:26] <gho5tjr> no
[07:30:32] <gho5tjr> Where is the documentation for the "input" event
[07:30:33] <seutje> oh event?
[07:30:37] <seutje> there's an input event?
[07:30:41] <gho5tjr> yes
[07:30:50] <seutje> u mean like keyPress or something?
[07:30:51] <gho5tjr> I've seen it mentioned on stackoverflow
[07:30:58] <gho5tjr> but I cannot find the documentation on it
[07:31:07] <gho5tjr> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17384218/jquery-input-event
[07:31:20] <seutje> sounds custom
[07:31:25] <gho5tjr> it's not
[07:31:28] <gho5tjr> stop wasting my time
[07:31:47] <seutje> oh snap, this shit is standard
[07:32:15] <seutje> cool attitude, my apologies for trying to be helpful, I will cease my attempts

[07:32:43] <gho5tjr> apparently yeah it's on mdn
[07:32:48] <gho5tjr> so it's a native event
[07:32:59] <Cork> ya
[07:33:00] <gho5tjr> trying to figure out browser compatibility...
[07:33:05] <gho5tjr> this table on mdn is useless
[07:33:15] <gho5tjr> why doesn't it include the versions
[07:33:36] <Cork> gho5tjr: cause it has been supported for ages
[07:33:43] <gho5tjr> that seems odd
[07:33:48] <gho5tjr> why am I just hearing about it
[07:33:54] <gho5tjr> and apparently others
[07:33:59] <Cork> cause it haven't been talked about much
[07:34:07] <gho5tjr> it seems pretty dope
[07:34:56] <gho5tjr> ome people are saying it only works well in modern browsers
[07:34:58] <gho5tjr> *some
[07:35:03] <gho5tjr> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6458840/on-input-change-event
[07:36:49] <fabioportieri> (i was joking)
[07:37:22] <Cork> gho5tjr: hmm, right forgot
[07:37:34] <Cork> gho5tjr: ie like always has poor support for it
[07:37:42] <Cork> was first implemented in ie9
[07:37:51] <gho5tjr> ah ok
[07:37:53] <Cork> all the other browsers has had it for a LONG time
[07:49:02] <jnardiello> hi all
[07:49:36] <jnardiello> is there a way for me to save all the children of a given div#id for later use?
[07:49:48] <jnardiello> what i mean is, i want to save a layout. Manipulate it a bit
[07:49:56] <jnardiello> and restore it if necessary
[07:49:57] <raj> jnardiello, $('div#id *')
[07:50:02] <jnardiello> no
[07:50:08] <gho5tjr> you save it in a variable
[07:50:10] <gho5tjr> e.g. cache it
[07:50:45] <jnardiello> i did that, but when i then do $("div#id").replaceWith(cachedLayout)
[07:50:54] <jnardiello> nothing changes
[07:50:58] <raj> but if you save it to a variable, and you change the elements, I believe the changes will be saved to that variable as well
[07:51:05] <jnardiello> exactly
[07:51:10] <raj> cuz its just pointers to elements
[07:51:14] <jnardiello> because it is a pointer to the DOM
[07:51:23] <jnardiello> the DOM changes => var reflect changes
[07:51:26] <gho5tjr> so append said html to a new element
[07:51:30] <gho5tjr> manipulate that element
[07:51:34] <raj> jnardiello, .clone()
[07:51:36] <raj> check it out
[07:51:36] <gho5tjr> copy over element's html if needed
[07:51:38] <gho5tjr> or clonse()
[07:51:53] <gho5tjr> *clone
[07:52:11] <jnardiello> ok thanks, i'll check it out
[07:53:15] <jnardiello> yay
[07:53:21] <jnardiello> raj, gho5tjr it works
[07:53:23] <jnardiello> thanks
[07:53:29] <jnardiello> i didn't think about that
[07:53:32] <raj> np
[07:55:07] <Fraz> http://kreaturamedia.com/layerslider-responsive-wordpress-slider-plugin/ how are transitions like these done? jquery animate, or?
[07:55:55] <seutje> looks like it
[07:56:00] <harris> Hi there... quick question on jQuery mobile 1.4 themes.... is there an easy way to globally change the default theme to the dark 'B' theme?
[07:56:00] <seutje> injecting inline styles like a madman
[07:57:17] <seutje> Fraz: actually, looks like the CSS values are just being set and the rest is being handled by css transitions
[07:57:49] <Fraz> seutje, it seems to work in older browsers too though
[07:58:05] <Fraz> although, with some less advanced effects
[07:58:06] <seutje> yeah, it's not doing everything via transtitions, it seems
[07:58:08] <Fraz> no 3d
[07:59:13] <Fraz> im building a slider designer with a ui and want to add options for transitions like on that page
[07:59:16] <seutje> Fraz: "Super smooth hardware accelerated CSS3 transitions with jQuery fallback"
[07:59:23] <Fraz> ah
[08:00:19] <Fraz> is the fallback simply just using jquery animate though?
[08:01:07] <fabioportieri> cool animations there
[08:02:43] <Fraz> would the ccs3 stuff be entireley css3, or also use jquery?
[08:03:11] <Fraz> i mean, would the slider itself be powered by jquery, and the transitions activated by it too?
[08:03:24] <Fraz> and css3 just handles the rendering?
[08:05:05] <gho5tjr> likely yes for adding the classes onclick
[08:05:14] <fabioportieri> uh?
[08:06:31] <DarkSector_> Okay so I am trying to make sure the supply_category is checked if all corresponding supplies are checked. How do I do that? This is what I have till now. v

[08:11:22] <bowenac> Does anyone see what I am trying to do with this                  $('<img src="'.text($(this).val()'"/>').appendTo('#selectedOptions'));
[08:12:14] <NoiseEee> bowenac:  don't see what you're trying to get at with 'text'
[08:12:37] <bowenac> I'm trying to append the value from a checkbox into an img src like this $('<img src=" "/>').appendTo('#selectedOptions').text($(this).val());
[08:12:46] <bowenac> but that appends it outside of the src
[08:14:11] <bowenac> here is a fiddle
[08:14:12] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/vhGtp/44/
[08:15:43] <TheMoonMaster> bowenac: http://jsfiddle.net/vhGtp/45/
[08:16:27] <NoiseEee> bowenac: i hope you chose jquery 1.4.3 by accident
[08:16:38] <NoiseEee> kind of no excuse to be writing code in 2014 using 1.4.3
[08:18:46] <Fraz> when using css3 transitions, can you call anotehr transition when one has finished?
[08:19:07] <bowenac> yea was from an example
[08:22:58] <bowenac> Thanks you TheMoonMaster now to figure out how to remove the image when unchecked haha
[08:23:34] <TheMoonMaster> bowenac: You could always use a data-attr or a class name derived from the checkbox.
[08:23:52] <bowenac> Yea was thinking the ID
[08:24:03] <bowenac> the values for the checkboxes are populated from a database
[08:24:56] <raj> is width:auto useless in a dialog?
[08:26:55] <hellothere> Hey yo's ive been trying to solve a prob that I have that when a submit button is pressed it actually does what it has to do and then it goes to the next argument which is disabling it
[08:32:56] <NoiseEee> hellothere: perhaps you need to cancel the event / jsfiddle
[08:33:58] <hellothere> http://jsfiddle.net/VMzNL/1/
[08:34:04] <hellothere> i got this but it wont work at all
[08:34:14] <hellothere> cause i am calling from a form
[08:38:22] <raj> hellothere, use .on() instead of .live()
[08:38:41] <raj> and .off() instead of .die()
[08:38:55] <hellothere> will that fix the problem?
[08:39:00] <hellothere> i am using 1.4 jquery version
[08:39:08] <hellothere> so i dunno if on and off will be in the version prolly now
[08:39:09] <hellothere> not*
[08:39:14] <raj> oh, I don't think on/off were there in 1.4
[08:39:31] <hellothere> yep and i dont think that would fix the problem as well
[08:39:45] <raj> you need to pass `event` to the callback function, and do event.preventDefault()
[08:39:51] <raj> as the first line
[08:40:12] <hellothere> hmm something like that?
[08:40:16] <hellothere> http://jsfiddle.net/VMzNL/3/
[08:41:23] <hellothere> http://jsfiddle.net/T22Tj/2/
[08:41:34] <hellothere> here is the raw code of my Jquery thing is as u see i am using a form
[08:41:49] <hellothere> and i used the event pre.default but no luck at all
[08:42:11] <raj> I think your /3/ looks right
[08:43:07] <hellothere> ye but look on the main on u just sended at the end thats pretty much my jquery, thing is as u see i am using a form where should i put the e.predefault?
[08:43:22] <hellothere> $('div.main').delegate('input.submit', 'click', function (e) { I had it in here
[08:43:25] <hellothere> but didnt work at all
[08:43:45] <hellothere> it actually shows the button as clickable but disabled from running its function
[08:50:29] <raj> hellothere, sorry, I'm not sure
[08:52:52] <hellothere> :(
[08:54:28] <hellothere> no thoughts at all?
[08:54:32] <hellothere> any opionions
[08:54:37] <hellothere> any maybes raj?
[08:55:24] <raj> you need to prevent default on the submit
[08:58:29] <hellothere> yes but how do i do that
[08:58:40] <hellothere> with the prevent default
[08:58:44] <hellothere> but where about should i put it?
[08:58:54] <raj> like you did in example /3/
[08:59:05] <raj> it can go anywhere
[08:59:24] <raj> or before the clickhandler I suppose
[08:59:30] <raj> not sure if that makes a difference
[08:59:37] <hellothere> hmm
[09:02:45] <hellothere> ye but example 3 is differnet it should be working but for some reason it doesnt work in my actual code
[09:11:04] <raj> hellothere, is it executing at lal?
[09:11:06] <raj> *all
[09:11:20] <raj> put a debugger statement in the submit callback function
[09:12:32] <hellothere> well it is executing
[09:12:38] <hellothere> when i pute the prevent default
[09:12:52] <hellothere> around the submit button
[09:13:31] <raj> "around" the submit button?
[09:13:33] <raj> what's that mean?
[09:14:51] <hellothere> http://jsfiddle.net/T22Tj/3/
[09:17:02] <raj> k
[09:18:05] <raj> you have to preventDefault on the form's 'submit' event
[09:21:24] <hellothere> doenst work :s
[09:21:44] <raj> cuz you don't have preventDefault on the form's submit' event
[09:22:09] <hellothere> something.masterForm.validate({
[09:22:14] <hellothere> this is the form submit right?
[09:23:09] <raj> I don't know what library you're using
[09:23:43] <raj> and also, there's no something.masterForm.validate() in the code you pasted
[09:24:40] <wa5ted> raj: hey
[09:24:55] <hellothere> http://jsfiddle.net/T22Tj/3/ there is right here :s
[09:24:57] <raj> hi
[09:25:24] <raj> hellothere, you should probably say the line number if I can't find it and the code is 160 lines
[09:25:36] <raj> just repasting the link isn't really constructive :)
[09:30:51] <hellothere> 53
[09:31:48] <raj> hellothere, that's a clickhandler
[09:31:57] <raj> you've just namedspaced it with a 'submit'
[09:32:09] <raj> oh sorry
[09:32:13] <raj> that's not namespacing with delegate
[09:32:20] <raj> ...that's just a class called submit on the input
[09:32:27] <duch_kazatel> hellothere - what version of jquery are you using?
[09:32:32] <raj> 1.4
[09:32:36] <duch_kazatel> ew.
[09:33:31] <bowenac> TheMoonMaster you still around
[09:33:33] <duch_kazatel> hellothere - 'submit' is an event, separate from click.
[09:33:34] <raj> duch_kazatel, where does $('div').dialog({'width':'auto'}) calculate the starting width? I'd like to analyze the code, but I can't seem to find it while stepping through
[09:33:47] <bowenac> Do you know how I would go about doing what I was talking about earlier
[09:33:57] <bowenac> I been messing with it for a while and not getting anywhere haha
[09:33:59] <TheMoonMaster> bowenac: The data/id thing?
[09:34:07] <bowenac> yea
[09:34:34] <TheMoonMaster> bowenac: Do the checkboxes have unique id's?
[09:34:42] <bowenac> yes
[09:34:55] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/vhGtp/50/
[09:35:15] <duch_kazatel> raj not terribly familiar with jqueryUI but something tells me that's applying a CSS style to your dialog box.
[09:35:31] <raj> duch_kazatel, it is
[09:35:38] <raj> but I wanna see the calculation
[09:35:40] <duch_kazatel> then jqui doesn't "calculate" anything.
[09:35:43] <duch_kazatel> that's in the browser.
[09:35:51] <duch_kazatel> what browser are you using?
[09:35:59] <raj> chrome
[09:36:12] <raj> it's an inline css style
[09:36:48] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/GwC6hGM.png - that's in the "elements" tab on chrome.
[09:36:51] <duch_kazatel> check that out.
[09:37:42] <raj> duch_kazatel, yes, I'm aware of that
[09:38:04] <raj> jq calculates a width for the dialog though
[09:38:12] <raj> and applies it to the element
[09:38:30] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.  no clue then?  if it's actually setting a numeric value for the width, not sure.
[09:38:39] <raj> it is
[09:38:49] <raj> I just can't seem to find where :T
[09:39:08] <duch_kazatel> probably somewhere deep in jqui - is "auto" a valid value for width?
[09:39:23] <duch_kazatel> i'd recommend passing a numeric value instead.
[09:39:42] <raj> duch_kazatel, officially it's not
[09:39:48] <raj> because it doesn't work cross-browser
[09:39:53] <raj> but unofficially it does work
[09:40:03] <raj> it's different than any other string being passed
[09:40:13] <duch_kazatel> eh, I'd avoid using it that way then, but your call ;)
[09:40:26] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/6bB65/ vs http://jsfiddle.net/6bB65/1/
[09:41:41] <duch_kazatel> did you look at the element styles on that?  i'm seeing width: auto; on the first one.
[09:42:46] <TheMoonMaster> bowenac: http://jsfiddle.net/vhGtp/51/ something like that can work
[09:42:54] <TheMoonMaster> Not the greatest solution, but it gets it done.
[09:43:17] <raj> duch_kazatel, meaning it's left to css to figure out?
[09:43:25] <duch_kazatel> raj yes
[09:43:43] <raj> I see
[09:44:16] <bowenac> awesome thats exactly what I wanted to do thanks a lot
[09:45:44] <raj> duch_kazatel, on my live site, width has a numeric value in element.style of chrome
[09:46:05] <duch_kazatel> did you check the fiddle?
[09:46:09] <duch_kazatel> and see what it's doing?
[09:47:21] <raj> i'm not sure why the fiddle show width:auto in element.style
[09:47:43] <duch_kazatel> there's obviously something different :)
[09:49:11] <TheMoonMaster> np
[09:49:29] <raj> oh, I'm mistaken, it's only numeric after a size adjustment
[09:49:40] <duch_kazatel> that makes more sence.
[09:49:53] <duch_kazatel> *sense
[10:23:54] <basiclaser> any ideas on Printing a web design portfolio
[10:24:51] <Asmoooh> with a printer maybe?
[10:24:54] <Asmoooh> or a plotter
[10:29:03] <shoky> raj: ya but they also say:  Download jQuery UI 1.10.3 (for jQuery 1.6+):
[10:34:35] <raj> oh, didn't catch that
[10:39:13] <igcewieling> basiclaser: google for wkhtmltopdf might be something useful
[10:45:00] <rina> is prop() a good method to use for checking whether an input is checked or not?
[10:45:19] <raj> shoky, does http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/16/jquery-1-8-box-sizing-width-csswidth-and-outerwidth/ mean border-box is fixed and that bug that you opened before has been closed?
[10:48:46] <shoky> raj nah the jqui bug is still there  http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8932
[10:49:23] <duch_kazatel> rina yes it is.
[10:51:13] <raj> wtf
[10:51:48] <shoky> raj  oh you said the bug that _i_ opened?
[10:52:18] <raj> ya, thought you had opened a bug
[10:52:30] <raj> no, that's not why I said "wtf"
[10:52:40] <raj> "wtf", why is this still open after over a year
[10:52:46] <shoky> heh
[10:53:20] <raj> seems like a straight forward "go through and change all height/width calculations just a tad"
[10:53:58] <shoky> dont remember the details but it wasn't that simple
[10:54:23] <shoky> or, that isn't so simple as it sounds ;p
[10:55:55] <shoky> it got "assigned" 5 weeks ago so maybe it's being worked on
[10:58:58] <BillCriswell> Ugh.

[11:01:48] <louism2wash> Hey guys, I am trying to grab all child elements of another element EXCEPT for any buttons that may be child elements.  How could I do this with JQuery?  Thanks.
[11:05:11] <shoky> louism2wash:  $('#elem').children().not('button')
[11:05:25] <louism2wash> shoky: thanks, I'll give that a shot
[11:05:30] <shoky> or  $('#elem > :not(button)')
[11:05:46] <grafi> shoky is not a button
[11:05:48] <grafi> :>
[11:05:50] <shoky> >:
[11:13:30] <michael_benin>  var content = $('head').children(':not(link,script)');
[11:13:41] <michael_benin> var content = $('head').children().not('link').not('script');

[11:15:47] <KWhat_Work> is anyone familiar with the iframe ajax file upload hackaround similar to http://ramui.com/articles/ajax-file-upload-using-iframe.html ?
[11:31:09] <Z_A_M> Does anyone have an idea why my function isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/yzfm9/12/ I'm trying to disable the "return" button when the focus is in a certain text box. So the form doesn't get submitted when the Serial Number text box has focus.
[11:34:08] <shoky> Z_A_M: $('myForm')  looks for <myForm> elements, you want $('#myForm')
[11:34:21] <Z_A_M> god damnit
[11:35:07] <shoky> but what you're doing with :focus doesnt look too great
[11:35:44] <Z_A_M> shoky: why do you say that? I've never used it before so I'm just playing around with it. Thanks for pointing out my noob mistake =/
[11:38:00] <shoky> Z_A_M: i'd do it like this http://jsfiddle.net/yzfm9/14/
[11:38:18] <shoky> 13 is enter key
[11:39:08] <Z_A_M> That's a lot cleaner.
[11:39:48] <Z_A_M> I assume .preventDefault() is the "submit" ?
[11:40:13] <shoky> yeah
[11:40:53] <Z_A_M> shoky: cool I did not know that. Thanks again!
[11:41:09] <shoky> np
[11:52:34] <jamesjohnson> Hi - having an issue with jquery-ui draggable stop event not being fired - would love any help or advice: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13041558/jqueryui-draggable-not-triggering-stop-event-when-object-is-in-iframe
[12:02:42] <BillCriswell> jamesjohnson: Interesting.
[12:04:54] <BillCriswell> It doesn't let you drag again after you release.
[12:06:38] <jamesjohnson> yeah - any ideas?
[12:06:53] <jamesjohnson> I think its because the mouseup event is being fired on the parent and not inside the iframe
[12:07:06] <jamesjohnson> on the iframeFix div that is created
[12:08:00] <jamesjohnson> but even when I tried to manually trigger a click event on a mouseup on the parent document- it doesn't correctly stop the draggable within the iframe
[12:10:13] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that's some iframe shit. I rarely venture there haha
[12:11:34] <NChief2> im using jquery-file-upload(https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload). If I add a file with $('form').fileupload('add', {fileInput $(this)});. is it possible to remove that add?
[12:28:52] <gdfg> selam
[12:31:27] <jphase> hi
[12:34:07] <BillCriswell> Ugh, touch and click events together are lame.
[12:34:30] <jphase> :[
[12:36:14] <raj> would it be crazy to unset the height/width on ui-dialog-content everytime there is a resize to avoid the box-sizing:border-box issue of jqui? http://68.46.138.78:8080/testdialog
[12:36:30] <zumba_addict> hi folks, is this a good way of disabling a button? $('.selector').attr('disabled',true');
[12:42:20] <masterkiller> is there any way to modify the number of decimals the parseFloat function outputs before it turns into: 1e-7
[12:49:05] <Rashad> Hello. Does anyone know of a jQuery plugin that lets you add an 'x' button to any element, which, when clicked, performs some custom code if necessary and then removes the element?
[12:50:01] <pachet> lol
[12:50:53] <JackBauer24> Rashad: it's like 10 minutes of work, you'll waste more time on looking for it
[12:51:19] <Rashad> But a plug in could have more features like animation.
[12:55:31] <scar> is there something out there that will hide and unhide iframes as they become too big for the space or when space oppens back up?
[12:56:08] <duch_kazatel> scar not sure what iframes have to do with that, but sure.  you could write code that does that.
[12:57:36] <scar> duch_kazatel, well iframes and other embed objects could be too big to fit on a smaller screen. im wondering what's the best method. i already do things on screen size change, but ive always wondered how to determine if any given iframe or something is too big, and to hide it
[12:59:51] <duch_kazatel> you could always check the width of the element against the width of, say, its parent and do a .hide(); for it.
[13:05:24] <BillCriswell> IE11's touch stuff is driving me nuts.
[13:05:59] <duch_kazatel> hah, because it says it supports it even if the device might now?
[13:06:03] <duch_kazatel> *not
[13:07:06] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: This issue is with using the touch screen. I have a draggable in a div with overflow scroll and it's just not happening.
[13:07:44] <BillCriswell> Well, at least with a swipe gesture. Can grab the scroll bar basically.
[13:07:55] <duch_kazatel> ah so the swipe isn't working then?
[13:08:18] <BillCriswell> Yeah, can only get one to work at a time lol.
[13:09:53] <BillCriswell> Of course Chrome works perfectly with the "touch punch" thing.
[13:10:39] <duch_kazatel> i think our mobile guys are using hammer.js
[13:12:16] <BillCriswell> Debugging IE with a touch screen is just asking for a first through a screen lol.
[13:12:44] <duch_kazatel> IE11's dev tools are so much better than the older ones.
[13:12:58] <BillCriswell> Yeah they are definitely nice.
[13:13:12] <duch_kazatel> i'm a windows guy myself so i really appreciated the changes.
[13:13:18] <BillCriswell> I think Safari's are looking the best, but i prefer Chrome's.
[13:13:54] <duch_kazatel> I mostly use firebug still.
[13:14:16] <BillCriswell> Yeah, familiar.
[13:14:31] <duch_kazatel> i use that with acebug and firerainbow.
[13:14:48] <duch_kazatel> just wish firefox and firebug would get the jsd.pause issue resolved finally.
[13:17:27] <guymandude> Anybody got any idea how to have my website connect to a Microsoft SQL Server 2012 database?
[13:17:55] <duch_kazatel> guymandude what's your backend?
[13:17:59] <guymandude> IIS
[13:18:13] <duch_kazatel> err, that's the server.  is the site ASP?
[13:18:19] <duch_kazatel> C#?
[13:18:44] <guymandude> just a sec
[13:19:42] <guymandude> I wrote it with Jquery and good ol html 5
[13:20:01] <duch_kazatel> you need a backend of some sort to connect it to a DB.
[13:20:09] <guymandude> got any ideas
[13:20:27] <duch_kazatel> if you're all ready using IIS and MSSQL, look at the .NET stack from microsoft.
[13:20:34] <guymandude> I tried php with no luck just not familiar
[13:20:45] <duch_kazatel> err, you'll have to learn something.
[13:20:52] <guymandude> right!
[13:20:56] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like you're looking for an out of the box solution.
[13:21:27] <duch_kazatel> PHP will work, the .NET stack will work, Django would work...
[13:21:51] <duch_kazatel> is this for a work project?
[13:22:08] <BillCriswell> Yay got it.
[13:22:42] <guymandude> ugh going crazy company is making me design software I have minimal programming experience, I'm the network admin
[13:23:00] <duch_kazatel> are there any programmers there?
[13:23:23] <voronika> companies like to challenge you to step out of your layer
[13:23:23] <BillCriswell> More importantly a User Interface guy?
[13:23:30] <BillCriswell> err... user interface person*
[13:23:34] <guymandude> nope just me I have a little VB experience and Java Script
[13:23:35] <duch_kazatel> voronika some do, sure.
[13:23:56] <duch_kazatel> guymandude you'll have to find a backend of some sort. there are tons out there.
[13:24:20] <duch_kazatel> voronika at my place, we'd never ask our IT guys to write code.
[13:24:25] <guymandude> duch which is easy learning curve
[13:24:34] <duch_kazatel> at least, not for our applications.
[13:24:41] <scar> duch_kazatel, do i use innerWidth ?
[13:24:43] <guymandude> we're a startup
[13:24:44] <scar> for the parent?
[13:24:54] <scar> i dont want the padding, etc of parent to be accounted for
[13:24:57] <scar> since it wont fit nayway there
[13:24:59] <voronika> duch_kazatel: they probably appreciate that.
[13:25:09] <duch_kazatel> and guymandude i'm partial to django, but it entirely depends on your companies' needs.
[13:25:24] <duch_kazatel> if you're a network guy writing code for a website, you might need to talk to folks and level with them.
[13:25:28] <duch_kazatel> scar no clue what you're talking about.
[13:25:48] <duch_kazatel> scar have a fiddle?
[13:26:01] <BillCriswell> scar: .width() wouldn't account for padding, .outerWidth() would.
[13:26:10] <Absolute0> can I combine a bunch of attr selectors into one? $("[for=a], [for=b], [for=c]") => $('[for="a,b,c"]')
[13:26:12] <guymandude> The software is just a web interface using information from a database
[13:26:38] <guymandude> I got the front end just banging my head on the backend
[13:27:06] <duch_kazatel> guymandude that's asking for all kinds of pain and problems, depending on what that database has.  you need somebody who knows what they're doing.
[13:27:41] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: Nope.
[13:27:53] <duch_kazatel> Absolute0 you'll need to look at filters for anything like that.
[13:28:05] <guymandude> That's what I said but they say they can't afford a database admin or programmer so they came to me sucks!
[13:28:25] <duch_kazatel> guymandude is this for a front-facing thing?
[13:29:41] <guymandude> yeah our employees use this to view and manipulate information on clients
[13:29:51] <Absolute0> quit
[13:30:11] <duch_kazatel> eeeehhhh.... i'd really suggest that they hire somebody to do that.
[13:30:22] <guymandude> we have one but I'm revamping it just need it to interact with the database
[13:30:27] <duch_kazatel> the cost of you spending your time on it will likely end up being greater
[13:30:40] <duch_kazatel> right - you need a backend.
[13:30:45] <guymandude> thanx
[13:30:51] <duch_kazatel> that's why you need a dev to do it.
[13:31:16] <guymandude> I'll see if I can get one of my programming buddies to do it
[13:31:50] <guymandude> I don't think it'll be a huge undertaking for a good programmer
[13:32:35] <duch_kazatel> yeah, shouldn't be.  but there are some considerations to make for things like that.
[13:32:47] <guymandude> thanx for your help duch
[13:33:01] <duch_kazatel> np man, good luck.  that situation sucks no matter what.
[13:33:26] <Magical1> can anyone tell me if jcarousel works if I move the js includes to the bottom of my html document rather than the head?
[13:33:59] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 did you try?
[13:34:03] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 it should.
[13:34:39] <Magical1> i have been trying will put my code in afiddle
[13:35:12] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 what's the issue you're having?
[13:35:35] <Magical1> I am not getting it to run
[13:35:48] <duch_kazatel> but you are when it's in the head?
[13:42:29] <OHNERO> I am having some trouble with the revolution slider
[13:42:41] <OHNERO> I have a button on this first slide but it is not responsive, does anyone know how to fix this?
[13:42:42] <OHNERO> http://mystore.com/
[13:45:57] <jphase> OHNERO: with CSS media queries?
[13:46:17] <OHNERO> I can do that but look at how the slider works, isn't that using jQuery to resize the text?
[13:46:44] <jphase> perhaps, I'm not sure how it does it, but that could also be done with CSS
[13:47:01] <OHNERO> hm well it's inline so I'm guessing it's done with jQuery
[13:47:08] <OHNERO> I have been trying to figure out how they do it but I'm not sure
[13:47:09] <jphase> ahh, good guess
[13:47:11] <jphase> hehe
[13:47:14] <OHNERO> ;)
[13:47:27] <jphase> and the button is generated by the slider?
[13:47:28] <OHNERO> I guess ill do it with media queries
[13:47:40] <OHNERO> It's in the HTML markup I added
[13:47:57] <OHNERO> each one is a specific "layer" that gets initialized at a certain time
[13:48:24] <jphase> hmm, I see, yeah the plugin probably doesn't account for certain elements. I'd just media query it up personally
[13:48:35] <OHNERO> yeah ill do that
[13:48:37] <OHNERO> Thanks for the help
[13:48:45] <jphase> not sure if that was much of a help, but sure! :D
[13:49:57] <OHNERO> Well you helped me reach my decision :)

[13:56:00] <Magical1> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/MrBalloonatic/c9tDU/ I have put it here ... can't work out what I have done wrong
[13:56:17] <shoky> Rashad: $(this)
[13:59:55] <Azrael_-> hi
[14:00:24] <Rashad> shoky: thanks
[14:00:28] <Magical1> I think I have configured it as in the docs
[14:02:16] <Azrael_-> i've got a form with 2 fields i validate them with jquery-validation and remote-functions. if i don't enter any field and directly try to submit the form, then the first submit is used for validating the fields with ajax-requests. only the second submit works as desired. how can i change this behaviour?
[14:08:28] <star_prone> hi
[14:09:45] <star_prone> is it possible to create an object that will contain all the options of a select element and then add them to the select already existing on the page?
[14:10:07] <star_prone> or do I have to add each option as soon as it is created
[14:17:09] <_cristian_> Hello. I have an image in my website, and the users can input the source URL of that image. Then I put that URL like this → $( '#my-image' ).prop( 'src', the_users_image_url );
[14:17:17] <_cristian_> Is there a way to get an XSS attack ?
[14:18:51] <duch_kazatel> _cristian_ is that getting saved to a backend?
[14:19:01] <duch_kazatel> and _cristian_ why are you doing that via .prop()?  why not .attr()?
[14:19:46] <_cristian_> duch_kazatel: It's in a chat application, and currently I'm not saving the messages, I send the message with socket and then they are deleted.
[14:19:53] <duch_kazatel> star_prone not sure what your question is asking. you can create that object no problem.  can you show a fiddle of what you're thinking?
[14:19:55] <_cristian_> And I will use .attr if this is needed.
[14:20:25] <duch_kazatel> _cristian_ .attr() is a little more sensible, but yes that sounds a little dangerous to me.
[14:20:31] <duch_kazatel> if that's getting consumed and shot to other users.
[14:20:47] <duch_kazatel> you should have some form of sanitization on those URLs to verify they're not malicious.
[14:21:58] <_cristian_> duch_kazatel: Can I sanitize that from javascript client ? Cause I'm using node.js as backend and I don't now some library to sanitize URLs
[14:22:03] <duch_kazatel> note that said sanitization should be done in a backend and not in your frontend javascript.
[14:22:15] <_cristian_> I see.
[14:22:31] <duch_kazatel> people can change the frontend javascript - anybody interested in exploiting vulnerabilities will know how to do that.
[14:22:54] <duch_kazatel> i'd suggest asking over in #Node.js for help on that - explain what you're doing and go from there.
[14:23:18] <_cristian_> Yes, I will do it, thanks duch_kazatel
[14:24:23] <duch_kazatel> _cristian_ note that you'll want to explain your use case over there to make sure you're clear.
[14:25:03] <Magical1> when I said it was  not running earlier I guess I should have said that the carousel is not moving, I had thought I had it set up to automatically scroll as in the api for jcarousel http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/docs/reference/api.html fiddle is here http://jsfiddle.net/MrBalloonatic/c9tDU/1/
[14:25:50] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 are you familiar with the console at all?
[14:26:19] <Magical1> console? like terminal that I am typing in??
[14:26:31] <duch_kazatel> console like in your web browser?
[14:26:34] <duch_kazatel> shows you javascript errors.
[14:26:54] <Magical1> oh,okay ... just started with javascript
[14:26:59] <Magical1> I'll have a look
[14:27:00] <duch_kazatel> what browser are you in?
[14:27:06] <Magical1> safari
[14:27:13] <duch_kazatel> oh :(
[14:27:27] <duch_kazatel> use chrome or firefox + firebug.  you'll have an easier time.
[14:27:45] <duch_kazatel> either way, you still have to init the carousel.  then you can call methods on it.
[14:28:09] <Magical1> whooops
[14:28:31] <duch_kazatel> so run $('.jcarousel').jcarousel(); first.  then you can do your $('.jcarousel').jcarousel('scroll', '+=2');
[14:30:02] <Magical1> thanks, so initializing instantiates the jcarousel?
[14:30:24] <duch_kazatel> i'm not sure that's how i'd phrase it, but sure.
[14:38:50] <Fresher> Hi, As a fresher of JavaScript and jQuery, I have a question that unsolved. Maybe some of you can help me.  The Question is Which Problems that does jQuery solved compare with JavaScript ?
[14:42:02] <Magical1> I believe that jQuery helps make things in Javascript more simple (once you work it out), it has lots of plugins and features to assist in navigating the DOM ...
[14:42:37] <Magical1> but I too am only a beginner at this
[14:48:29] <duch_kazatel> Fresher what exactly do you mean?
[14:48:34] <duch_kazatel> jQuery is javascript.
[14:48:54] <myosotis> the biggest benefit to using jQuery is that it makes many common tasks much simpler and cleaner
[14:49:42] <duch_kazatel> Fresher jquery has sizzle, which is a good spin on selecting elements in the dom (though querySelectorAll does many similar things), but it greatly simplifies lots of things and handles lots of cross-browser issues for you.
[14:49:44] <myosotis> something like "Find all the anchors that meet this criteria and open them in a new window" is much more concise written using jQuery than javascript alone, and will work on more browsers without worrying about their differences
[14:50:03] <duch_kazatel> it's all about abstraction.
[14:52:35] <Fresher> thank you all, I just sort out that : 1. cross-broswer compatibility, 2. Dom API 3. Simplicity 4. build-in effects . And your answers also very good . I try to make it clear. Thank you again!
[14:54:32] <Magical1> duch_kazatel: I have my jsfiddle open now in firefox it is saying cannot call methods on jcarousel  prior to initialization, does that mean that jsfiddle is trying to run my js in the fiddle before it loads the external resources?
[14:56:23] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 no.  it means you're not initializing it yourself first.
[14:57:05] <Magical1> http://jsfiddle.net/MrBalloonatic/c9tDU/3/
[15:02:44] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 - http://jsfiddle.net/c9tDU/4/
[15:02:50] <duch_kazatel> start there.
[15:05:50] <drager> I'm trying to make an element draggable and it works but the cursor "flows" to the left corner, I want to be able to have it everywhere (if that makes sense); https://dpaste.de/c6oi
[15:06:59] <duch_kazatel> drager "flows"?
[15:07:34] <drager> duch_kazatel: The cursor stays in the left corner if you do a mousedown on it
[15:07:41] <drager> i want it to stay where I pressed
[15:08:07] <duch_kazatel> can you setup a fiddle?
[15:08:18] <drager> duch_kazatel: One sec
[15:09:53] <Magical1> duch_kazatel: thanks, I had just seen that I was trying to do things in 2 different fuctions ... rather than initializing and follwing on with other instructions in the one function
[15:10:32] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 do you understand what that does?
[15:10:38] <duch_kazatel> and why you might use that function?
[15:11:07] <drager> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/u2tHD/
[15:11:24] <Magical1> the function triggers jquery when the document in loaded, so that the functionality required can occur?
[15:11:46] <duch_kazatel> that's one reason to use it.
[15:12:08] <duch_kazatel> and drager your problem looks like it might be on liunes 26 and 27.
[15:12:09] <duch_kazatel> *ines
[15:13:10] <Magical1> also having the body tag seems to have been redundant
[15:13:17] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 in jsfiddle, yes.
[15:13:32] <joclip> I'm wondering if someone can help me understand this code http://bpaste.net/show/9vG2kCsD16Gmqf8cjzNX/
[15:14:18] <duch_kazatel> joclip what aren't you understanding?
[15:14:23] <joclip> $(this).attr('data-delete-url')
[15:14:46] <duch_kazatel> it's getting the data-delete-url attribute of the clicked .appointment-delete-link
[15:14:48] <joclip> duch_kazatel: i don't understand where it's getting the attribute from
[15:14:58] <joclip> ahhhh
[15:15:10] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is going to be the clicked .appointment-delete-link
[15:17:01] <joclip> so when i click the link i'm seeing it is going to the wrong url in the console.  Do I understand you correctly that the url is taken from the link clicked?
[15:17:08] <drager> duch_kazatel: Yeah
[15:18:10] <duch_kazatel> joclip probably.
[15:19:43] <duch_kazatel> joclip you mean the URL for the ajax request?
[15:21:52] <joclip> duch_kazatel: I think there was a misprint in the book I'm reading and it missed the data-delete-url attribute on the <a>
[15:22:02] <joclip> no wonder it wasn't working.
[15:22:07] <joclip> but yes that's what i meant
[15:22:19] <duch_kazatel> joclip what book are you reading?
[15:23:34] <joclip> duch_kazatel: Instant Flask Web Development. In a section about interacting with the database and deleting a record by sending a HTTP DELETE request.
[15:24:15] <duch_kazatel> aaaah.  yeah the HTML should have an attr on the anchor.
[15:25:04] <duch_kazatel> or whatever has that class on it.
[15:26:23] <duch_kazatel> i assume that class is on a link.
[15:26:46] <joclip> yes
[15:28:16] <duch_kazatel> yeah, then that link should have an attr on it either in the HTML or set via some other javascript.
[15:30:29] <jnardiello> guys, i have a callback. When calling it from window.load it works find taking into consideration images. The very same callback from window.resize is giving me problems
[15:30:48] <jnardiello> and it works as if images were not loaded properly
[15:30:50] <jnardiello> any clue?
[15:30:59] <duch_kazatel> jnardiello can you share your code?
[15:31:15] <duch_kazatel> via a fiddle or otherwise?
[15:31:35] <jnardiello> well, it's quite difficult to setup a working fiddle but i'll paste there my code
[15:31:37] <jnardiello> hold on
[15:31:59] <duch_kazatel> just the body of the function may be helpful.
[15:32:24] <jnardiello> http://jsfiddle.net/6SvaL/
[15:32:51] <jnardiello> the function is the buildpage, with a submethod called "paginate"
[15:33:03] <jnardiello> which are called at the very bottom
[15:33:09] <duch_kazatel> why is $(window).resize(function () { inside of the load?
[15:33:13] <duch_kazatel> i'd move it.
[15:33:19] <jnardiello> black magic
[15:33:46] <jnardiello> mainly because some browsers (chrome) fires a resize event before loading
[15:33:54] <jnardiello> that is supposed to prevent that
[15:34:21] <jnardiello> (it works, i'm working on this damn thing from 12hrs)
[15:34:34] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/6SvaL/1/ just try moving it.
[15:35:01] <jnardiello> i tried, as i mentioned that causes problems
[15:35:17] <duch_kazatel> your workaround for chrome might be causing all your other problem s;)
[15:35:20] <duch_kazatel> *problems.
[15:35:48] <jnardiello> what about the images thing?
[15:35:50] <jnardiello> any clue?
[15:36:20] <jnardiello> any idea why buildpage would be applied to the new html without taking into account images?
[15:36:59] <duch_kazatel> that's doing a lot of calculations when calling a resize.
[15:37:15] <jnardiello> yeah, i know
[15:38:19] <duch_kazatel> so where is this selecting images?
[15:38:57] <jnardiello> it selecting elements
[15:39:02] <jnardiello> some of the elements are images
[15:39:05] <jnardiello> (not all of them)
[15:39:11] <duch_kazatel> $('.element') is on some images?
[15:39:15] <jnardiello> yeah
[15:39:16] <jnardiello> might be
[15:40:06] <jnardiello> as you could guess, i'm not super skilled on jquery, i'm mostly trying over and over
[15:40:37] <duch_kazatel> not sure - your code is kind of confusing and not structured very well.  lots of duplication.  without seeing things in action it's hard to know.
[15:40:49] <Magical1> duch_kazatel: should I worry about the warning "Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead." ?
[15:41:08] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 not for now.  i assume you're in chrome?
[15:41:23] <jnardiello> Magical1: we get that error as well, all the time
[15:41:33] <jnardiello> not sure where it is from
[15:41:42] <jnardiello> but never caused harm so far
[15:41:50] <Magical1> okay thanks
[15:41:58] <Magical1> firefox
[15:42:19] <duch_kazatel> oh yeah.  that's an issue with jQuery.  just a warning that's fixed in the fext version.
[15:42:21] <duch_kazatel> *next
[15:42:36] <jnardiello> duch_kazatel: jquery is so frustrating
[15:42:40] <duch_kazatel> not to me.
[15:42:51] <jnardiello> well, yeah, i guess it's just a personal point of view
[15:42:58] <duch_kazatel> in fact, a lot of your code problems are javascript problems, not jquery.
[15:43:12] <Magical1> I am guessing duch_kazatel is the jquery guru, and thanks for your help so far ...
[15:43:25] <jnardiello> can you make an example? how can i improve it in your opinion?
[15:43:28] <duch_kazatel> haha, i'm not a guru by any stretch.  i just know the docs.
[15:44:03] <duch_kazatel> jnardiello let me try to improve one part.
[15:44:12] <jnardiello> ok thanks
[15:45:07] <jnardiello> the whole thing is a sort of paginator that has to adapt elements in the view according to the height of the window
[15:45:12] <Magical1> well you can probably code circles around me, I have a picture of you guys in my mind pointing and sniggering at some of these questions I am asking ... but hey I am a n00b, I'll admit it, but at least I am trying to learn
[15:45:14] <jnardiello> it should also react on resize
[15:46:03] <jnardiello> Magical1: that is the kind of self-underconsideration you should really avoid
[15:46:18] <duch_kazatel> nah i'm not.  just learn the docs.
[15:46:24] <jnardiello> you'll always meet people knowing more
[15:46:34] <jnardiello> and you probably know more than others on specific topics
[15:46:38] <jnardiello> so... :)
[15:46:52] <Magical1> I know ... but no one seems to believe I can build my own site  ... they all say I should hire a pro ... but I want to try
[15:47:11] <Magical1> I believe I can
[15:47:18] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 what's your site for?
[15:47:27] <jnardiello> and as uncle bob always say:"there're no stupid questions, only stupid answers"
[15:47:30] <jnardiello> jeee
[15:47:30] <Magical1> I am a childrens entertainer
[15:48:03] <Magical1> want to make it in html then migrate it to wordpress
[15:48:39] <jnardiello> awesome, good luck
[15:48:43] <jnardiello> jeee
[15:48:43] <Magical1> given too much money to other developers in the past, did not get what I wanted, so i figured this time I'll do it myself
[15:48:46] <jnardiello> it'll be interesting
[15:49:15] <Magical1> well I was trying to use the Zurb foundation 5 framework
[15:49:21] <jnardiello> yeah, don't waste money on so called "pros". You can't probably afford real pros, will get the result you want with some work
[15:49:32] <jnardiello> and eventually become some sort of webdesigner on the way
[15:49:39] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 what sort of entertaining do you do?
[15:49:53] <Magical1> magic and balloon animals
[15:50:00] <Magical1> mostly balloon art
[15:50:04] <coldhead> erotic balloon animals?
[15:50:05] <duch_kazatel> okay. so why should i hire you to do that?
[15:50:16] <Magical1> not really my scene
[15:50:23] <duch_kazatel> jnardiello's logic dictates that I could do that myself.
[15:50:32] <duch_kazatel> so why hire somebody else to do it ;)
[15:50:48] <jnardiello> nah
[15:51:00] <Magical1> well, other than being the best in my country and the fact I can make anything out of balloons, people find me entertaining ...
[15:51:02] <duch_kazatel> build your site if you want to learn how to do it, but know that we "so-called professionals" have spent a lot of time learning how to do these thingsd.
[15:51:24] <duch_kazatel> just make sure you're building it yourself for the right reasons :)
[15:51:30] <jnardiello> oh come on, dear god. i'm not going down that way
[15:51:51] <duch_kazatel> jnardiello then what did you mean by what you said?
[15:52:19] <jnardiello> i meant that a good web designer or developer is expensive
[15:52:21] <jnardiello> very expensive
[15:52:25] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[15:52:36] <Magical1> oh I don't doubt it... and true profession;s are great I have worked with 3 design companies in the last 8 years on this site, and they all went belly up along with my files
[15:52:58] <jnardiello> either you have a budget
[15:53:07] <duch_kazatel> jnardiello i see what you're getting at.
[15:53:19] <jnardiello> or hiring some local cheap developer has a very high chance of just wasting money
[15:53:37] <Magical1> never hired cheap ...
[15:53:52] <duch_kazatel> oddly enough, sometimes the more expensive end per hour will save you money.
[15:53:53] <duch_kazatel> go figure.
[15:54:08] <Magical1> I couldn't agree more
[15:54:19] <jnardiello> That is, definetely, true
[15:54:28] <duch_kazatel> your particular problem is interesting, Magical1.  what country?
[15:54:35] <Magical1> Ireland
[15:54:48] <duch_kazatel> very cool.
[15:55:07] <Magical1> http://www.mrballoonatic.com/test/ <-- what I have so far
[15:56:04] <jnardiello> well-done
[15:56:13] <jnardiello> (imho)
[15:56:21] <Magical1> thanks
[15:56:45] <Magical1> I have been reading lots and playingg with wordpress and trying to work out what will go where
[15:56:59] <Magical1> like sidebars and stuff
[15:57:48] <Magical1> was going to do the footer social links using sprites when I work that out ... thought I could do sprites for the clients
[15:58:03] <Magical1> once I work out that
[15:58:14] <Magical1> sprite maps
[15:58:47] <duch_kazatel> so jnardiello this is what i came up with using very minimal effort on the 'paginate' func: http://jsfiddle.net/R896B/1/
[15:59:05] <duch_kazatel> keep getting pulled around.
[15:59:32] <duch_kazatel> and Magical1 I might suggest using social media widgets if you can.
[15:59:47] <duch_kazatel> otherwise your site looks pretty nice so far.
[16:00:30] <Magical1> I'll look into those when I have a chance ... any you would recommend in particular?
[16:01:03] <duch_kazatel> the ones from facebook, twitter, google+, etc.
[16:01:09] <duch_kazatel> or ShareThis.
[16:01:11] <jnardiello> duch_kazatel: thanks a lot
[16:01:15] <duch_kazatel> they have a solution.
[16:01:25] <Magical1> oaky and thanks
[16:01:26] <duch_kazatel> jnardiello basically I removed all your code duplication.
[16:01:47] <jnardiello> improvements you suggested, make a lot of sense and i'll surely do some refactoring following your suggestions
[16:02:19] <jnardiello> currently i code a lot cleaner :( On this particular task i'm so desperate that i'm just throwing down code until it works
[16:02:20] <duch_kazatel> i would start there - your code is very convoluted as it is right now, which is likely causing some headaches.  are you familiar with how to use a debugger?
[16:02:42] <jnardiello> debugger? What do you mean more specifically?
[16:02:52] <duch_kazatel> what browser are you using?
[16:02:52] <duch_kazatel> chrome?
[16:02:53] <jnardiello> i'm using phpstorm by jstorm and devtools
[16:02:57] <jnardiello> yeah
[16:03:18] <jnardiello> with the good old console.log to output stuff and see what is going on
[16:03:40] <duch_kazatel> you know how to use the "Sources" tab though?
[16:03:43] <duch_kazatel> not just the consolke?
[16:03:45] <duch_kazatel> *console
[16:04:04] <jnardiello> ehm
[16:04:04] <jnardiello> no
[16:04:11] <duch_kazatel> ever used any debugger for anything?
[16:04:29] <jnardiello> no
[16:05:09] <duch_kazatel> go read up on how to do that - it will change your life.  you can step through your code line by line, pause it, etc. and see what's actually going on.
[16:05:25] <Magical1> anyway, I am not getting the hang of this javascript right now, I am going to go read some more and try again.
[16:05:41] <jnardiello> ok duch_kazatel i'll definetely do it
[16:06:02] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 what was your problem again?
[16:06:40] <Magical1> I cannot get the autoscroll to work, I think I just need to work out how to use the plugin better
[16:06:54] <duch_kazatel> can you link to your fiddle again?
[16:07:09] <Magical1> http://fiddle.jshell.net/MrBalloonatic/c9tDU/7/
[16:08:25] <jnardiello> https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/javascript-debugging is this a good starting point?
[16:08:46] <Magical1> oh thanks
[16:09:20] <lukeg_> the way .data() works with objects is not consistent with how javascript works, example:
[16:09:50] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 you're missing some CSS>
[16:09:51] <lukeg_> $(document).data({'foo':'bar'}) $(document).data('foo') // bar $(document).data({'foo':undefined}) $(document).data('foo') // bar
[16:09:59] <duch_kazatel> Magical1  - .jcarousel ul {
[16:09:59] <duch_kazatel>     width: 20000em;
[16:09:59] <duch_kazatel>     position: relative;
[16:09:59] <duch_kazatel>     list-style: none;
[16:09:59] <lukeg_> vs. x = {foo:'bar'}; x['foo'] // bar x = {foo:undefined}; x['foo'] // undefined
[16:09:59] <duch_kazatel>     margin: 0;
[16:09:59] <duch_kazatel>     padding: 0;
[16:10:00] <duch_kazatel> }
[16:10:03] <duch_kazatel> woops my bad.
[16:10:26] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 go here -> http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/docs/reference/installation.html look at the section about "style the carousel"  look at the section for the jcarousel ul.
[16:10:52] <duch_kazatel> lukeg_ what's going on now?
[16:11:00] <Magical1> okay
[16:11:13] <lukeg_> undefined values are treated differently in .data() then is expected
[16:11:41] <lukeg_> setting an undefined value doesn't do anything if there's a non-undefined value in that location
[16:12:03] <lukeg_> which is different than how JS handles dictionaries
[16:12:29] <duch_kazatel> you mean objects.
[16:12:30] <lukeg_> here's example code with linebreaks:
[16:12:45] <lukeg_> $(document).data({'foo':'bar'})
[16:12:49] <lukeg_> $(document).data('foo') // bar
[16:12:53] <lukeg_> $(document).data({'foo':undefined})
[16:12:57] <lukeg_> $(document).data('foo') // bar
[16:13:32] <lukeg_> you would expect undefined in the last case
[16:14:45] <duch_kazatel> interesting, didn't know you could use curlies like that with data.
[16:16:09] <duch_kazatel> looks like that's why this exists: http://api.jquery.com/removedata/
[16:16:58] <duch_kazatel> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11558
[16:17:15] <duch_kazatel> there you go.  known bug.  very odd either way.
[16:17:48] <lukeg_> hmm
[16:18:24] <lukeg_> so it seems like only null should be used as a value to get 'proper' function
[16:19:13] <Magical1> duch_kazatel: you are a legend sir!
[16:19:22] <coldhead> duch_kazatel++
[16:19:31] <lukeg_> thanks duch_kazatel
[16:19:41] <duch_kazatel> lukeg_ no problem.
[16:19:52] <duch_kazatel> and Magical1 hah, nah.  i just poked the docs.
[16:20:01] <duch_kazatel> but thanks anyway.
[16:20:30] <lukeg_> perhaps the docs should be updated because this is misleading: "An object of key-value pairs of data to update."
[16:20:50] <duch_kazatel> lukeg_ if you look at the bug, it says basically the same thing - the docs are misleading.
[16:21:23] <Magical1> now I just need to work out how to make it an infinite loop, can't believe I missed the ul styling
[16:23:30] <duch_kazatel> Magical1 - http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/docs/reference/configuration.html
[16:23:40] <duch_kazatel> specifically, http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/docs/reference/configuration.html#wrap
[16:23:44] <duch_kazatel> in your init, set that wrap param.
[16:24:01] <Magical1> thnkas
[16:24:05] <Magical1> *thanks
[16:25:30] <Azrael_-> i've got a form with 2 fields i validate them with jquery-validation and remote-functions. if i don't enter any field and directly try to submit the form, then the first submit is used for validating the fields with ajax-requests. only the second submit works as desired. how can i change this behaviour?
[16:31:11] <duch_kazatel> Azrael_- got any code to share?
[17:03:36] <Magical1> duch_kazatel: thanks again that is now working perfectly, or as close to perfect as I can get http://fiddle.jshell.net/c9tDU/8/
[17:07:15] <Magical1> thanks again for all the help

[18:21:23] <fattest> does anyone know any sliding plugins that look something similar to this? http://goo.gl/qMZfDT just the slider...i need the mouse over effect...
[18:22:03] <lianzinho> my god
[18:22:07] <lianzinho> that music!
[18:22:11] <lianzinho> hahahaha
[18:22:24] <lianzinho> do you mean, the carousel effect?
[18:22:39] <lianzinho> oh, I see
[18:24:24] <duch_kazatel> fattest eeeeh... i'd avoid doing that if you could.
[18:25:02] <fattest> duch_kazatel: my friends and i like it....do you know any similar plugins
[18:25:24] <duch_kazatel> nope - that site was done in flash.  and that sort of UX kills userflow.
[18:25:40] <duch_kazatel> it's an awful lot of work when you could have done a simple gallery instead.
[18:28:24] <duch_kazatel> but meh - if you really need it, here are two plugins - manos.malihu.gr/jquery-thumbnail-scroller/ http://www.convergent-evolution.co.uk/resources/jquery-plugins/scrolling-carousel/
[18:28:35] <vinex08> hi guys, help? http://jsfiddle.net/aj7YN/1/   i want to have an arrow(or anything clickable to trigger the slidetoggle) just right beside the menu name.
[18:29:13] <duch_kazatel> vinex08 you have that all ready, don't you?
[18:29:24] <vinex08> i lost it :`(
[18:29:28] <lianzinho> vinex08: what's the problem?
[18:30:16] <duch_kazatel> all right - gotta head out folks.  enjoy.
[18:30:44] <vinex08> the li that has children will have an arrow or anything that is clickable , when clicked it will show its submenu
[18:38:01] <myndzi> why doesn't .map return an array?
[18:39:22] <lianzinho> vinex08: http://jsfiddle.net/halianlian/aj7YN/2/
[18:40:03] <lianzinho> you had to adjust the position of the :after, and add  position: relative to the element it relates to
[18:40:45] <lianzinho> but your :hover pseudoclasses are screwing up the position of  stuff, you'll have to clean that
[18:41:01] <jkingaround> anybody have a poster wall type plugin? i'm looking for something to diplay images in an endless wall if you will. and the overflow is moveable. any ideas? thanks
[18:41:06] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/halianlian/aj7YN/2/  <--- its the same as #1
[18:41:20] <vinex08> dont see any changes?
[18:41:51] <lianzinho> vinex08: http://jsfiddle.net/halianlian/aj7YN/3/
[18:44:29] <vinex08> so when i click the black box , the submenus should show right?
[18:44:39] <vinex08> the submenu of the parent li
[18:48:53] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/aj7YN/4/  <-- just a little bit more fixing...
[18:49:25] <vinex08> now i only want the submenus of that parent li to show. right now it shows all the submenus
[18:55:34] <shoky> vinex08: $(this).next().slideToggle()
[18:57:08] <vinex08> yeheyyyy!!!!
[18:57:58] <vinex08> thanks guys http://jsfiddle.net/aj7YN/6/
[19:02:37] <vinex08> just a little bit more:: http://jsfiddle.net/aj7YN/7/  <-- when clicked $this becomes red, then when clicked again i want it to go black again.
[19:05:25] <shoky> vinex08: http://jsfiddle.net/aj7YN/8/
[19:06:40] <vinex08> wowww.. ill just check what toggleClass do
[19:06:49] <shoky> toggles a class
[19:06:57] <shoky> notice i also added a line in the css
[19:08:02] <vinex08> .arrowbox.red { background: red }
[19:08:22] <vinex08> oh i see!! it's from the word itself,,, toggle haha
[19:08:52] <vinex08> now im going to try the 'MENU' will change it to CLOSE when clicked.
[19:09:18] <vinex08> in the future i'll change that into an image with open and close icons
[19:09:36] <vinex08> ofcousrse same with the black boxes
[19:09:57] <lianzinho> vinex08: why are you putting the MENU word inside the content of the :before ?
[19:11:30] <lianzinho> why don't you put it as a normal text inside the div? or using a <a> instead of a div ?
[19:12:19] <vinex08> i just copied this from a tutorial. anyway, i can do that
[19:14:13] <lianzinho> vinex08: much easier to manipulate… than you just change it with .text()
[19:14:20] <lianzinho> and then change it back
[19:15:45] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/aj7YN/9/ yehey!!!
[19:16:01] <vinex08> lianzinho: could you do that ? please?
[19:16:32] <vinex08> hmm
[19:16:51] <vinex08> anyway text would not be possible, because im gonna change that into open/close icons..
[19:17:42] <lianzinho> vinex08: use auxiliar classes then...
[19:17:53] <lianzinho> with different texts and different icons
[19:18:00] <lianzinho> and toggle them
[19:23:06] <vinex08> olrayti
[21:03:11] <lasha> I need some low level jQuery UI sortable() help
[21:03:58] <lasha> The way sortable() rearranges HTML as youre dragging, it removes my line breaks
[21:04:27] <lasha> and i'm sorting image elements are the text-align: justify
[21:04:43] <lasha> so when it takes away my linebreak/space, it fucks with my justification
[21:05:07] <lasha> how the F do I get it to KEEP my line break, or at least force one in there as dragging is happening?
[21:12:15] <duch_kazatel> goooooooooood evening folks.
[21:14:31] <duch_kazatel> anything interesting going on?
[21:43:48] <fattest> if i have <a name="hello" id="3"></a> is it possible to echo what name equals to with javascript?
[21:44:51] <duch_kazatel> fattest sure, but name isn't a valid HTML5 attribute.
[21:45:01] <fattest> duch_kazatel: what should i use
[21:45:06] <duch_kazatel> ID
[21:45:28] <duch_kazatel> can you define "echo"?
[21:45:35] <fattest> duch_kazatel: alert
[21:45:42] <fattest> duch_kazatel: or display
[21:45:48] <duch_kazatel> are you using jquery?
[21:45:53] <duch_kazatel> or just vanilla javascript?
[21:46:01] <fattest> duch_kazatel: yes i am
[21:46:01] <duch_kazatel> and do you have a fiddle?
[21:46:11] <fattest> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/2B3bN/4/
[21:46:18] <duch_kazatel> $('a').attr('name'); is the jquery version.
[21:46:31] <duch_kazatel> but that selector will match ALL a tags on the page.
[21:46:43] <fattest> ill have a look now
[21:46:57] <duch_kazatel> so window.alert($('a').attr('name'));, if name were a valid attribute.
[21:47:22] <duch_kazatel> which it isn't.
[21:48:05] <duch_kazatel> so use a different attribute.
[21:58:26] <fattest> duch_kazatel: are you still here?
[21:58:33] <duch_kazatel> yup
[21:59:07] <fattest> duch_kazatel: this is what im trying to do. http://jsfiddle.net/2B3bN/17/  i want it to echo the discription in the modal too
[21:59:45] <duch_kazatel> the dscription in the modal?
[21:59:57] <duch_kazatel> or the title of the <a> tage?
[21:59:58] <duch_kazatel> *tag
[22:00:10] <fattest> duch_kazatel: i got <a discription="image 1" >
[22:00:20] <fattest> duch_kazatel: i added my custom attribute
[22:00:29] <duch_kazatel> fattest you cannot define custom attributes.
[22:00:32] <duch_kazatel> that is not valid.
[22:00:42] <duch_kazatel> unless you prepend them with data-
[22:00:49] <fattest> duch_kazatel: what should i use instead of discription tag
[22:00:51] <duch_kazatel> so you can do data-description
[22:01:04] <duch_kazatel> but you cannot create your own attributes otherwise.
[22:01:34] <fattest> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/2B3bN/8/ it worked for tihs one
[22:01:53] <duch_kazatel> sure, that's still not valid HTML.
[22:01:58] <duch_kazatel> baby steps ;)
[22:02:11] <duch_kazatel> you want valid HTML no matter what.
[22:02:27] <fattest> oh ok
[22:02:39] <duch_kazatel> in your case, the description in the modal looks like it's based off the title attribute.
[22:02:41] <fattest> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/2B3bN/18/ i changed description to data-description
[22:03:00] <joro> morning
[22:03:01] <fattest> duch_kazatel: i want to display the title aswell by the way
[22:03:29] <duch_kazatel> you want to display title and data-description?
[22:04:00] <fattest> duch_kazatel: yes.
[22:04:10] <fattest> duch_kazatel: it already displays the title though
[22:04:37] <duch_kazatel> and btw, your markup is still invalid. data-description= "image 1" should be data-description="image 1".
[22:04:47] <duch_kazatel> why don't you read the docs for the plugin you're using?
[22:05:03] <duch_kazatel> or place the description text into the title attribute?
[22:05:24] <fattest> duch_kazatel: how do i do that ^
[22:06:23] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/2B3bN/20/
[22:06:24] <duch_kazatel> >.>
[22:07:10] <fattest> duch_kazatel: it doesn't work for any other slides though
[22:07:24] <duch_kazatel> sure - you have to change all of them...
[22:07:31] <duch_kazatel> i change the first one for you.
[22:07:35] <duch_kazatel> as an example.
[22:08:18] <fattest> duch_kazatel: so i can't echo a custom attribute (description) in the image?
[22:08:36] <duch_kazatel> i can look at the code for you again.
[22:08:37] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[22:08:42] <fattest> duch_kazatel: i mean in the modal? the documentation has nothing about what i need . it has apis and keyboard shortcuts
[22:09:14] <duch_kazatel> you could munge it, but the plugin is pretty self explanatory.  why can't you just change the HTML?
[22:09:52] <fattest> duch_kazatel: what do you mean change the html? the way it displays the title is from <h4 class="modal-title"></h4>
[22:10:15] <duch_kazatel> ... the html of the anchors on your end.
[22:10:18] <duch_kazatel> the way I did.
[22:10:33] <duch_kazatel> put all the text into the title attribute.
[22:11:14] <fattest> duch_kazatel: by text do you mean description?
[22:11:47] <fattest> duch_kazatel: put all the text into the title attribute. --> put all the descripition into the title attribute. ?
[22:12:04] <duch_kazatel> but all the text you want to display in the modal into the title attribute.
[22:12:20] <duch_kazatel> *put
[22:12:54] <fattest> duch_kazatel: i want to echo the discription under the image...the title should go above the image (like it does) and the description will have smaller font text because of the bigger length
[22:13:04] <fattest> duch_kazatel: by echo i mean display
[22:13:19] <duch_kazatel> link to documentation for the plugin.
[22:13:31] <duch_kazatel> because it sounds like that plugin is not what you want.
[22:13:50] <fattest> duch_kazatel: https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery/blob/master/README.md#carousel-setup
[22:16:14] <fattest> duch_kazatel: will it be possible to do it the non html way?
[22:16:43] <duch_kazatel> fattest pretty sure this plugin does not do what you want it to do.  i'm reading.
[22:17:22] <duch_kazatel> yeah fattest this doesn't support the particular feature you want it to.
[22:17:42] <fattest> duch_kazatel: awww
[22:18:03] <fattest> duch_kazatel: they have <h4 class="modal-title"></h4> to display the title. can't we make our own one too?
[22:18:42] <duch_kazatel> once you modify the plugin, you can't easily update it.
[22:19:35] <fattest> duch_kazatel: i got an idea! how do i display this $('a').attr('namew')
[22:19:48] <duch_kazatel> don't
[22:19:50] <duch_kazatel> that is invalid.
[22:19:53] <duch_kazatel> fix your code.
[22:20:00] <fattest> duch_kazatel: document.write($('a').attr('data-description')); ?
[22:20:02] <duch_kazatel> and don't munge a fix
[22:20:15] <fattest> duch_kazatela; data-description is valid right?
[22:20:24] <duch_kazatel> sure.  don't munge that fix.
[22:20:41] <duch_kazatel> and don't use a document.write for that lol
[22:20:52] <fattest> duch_kazatel: what should i use
[22:21:13] <duch_kazatel> nothing, because you're going to hack in a fix when what you need is a different plugin.
[22:21:17] <duch_kazatel> why are you so attached to this one?
[22:22:06] <fattest> duch_kazatel: i like how when you click on an image, it makes it bigger into a modal and then you can drag your mouse at the edges to display the next image
[22:23:12] <duch_kazatel> wait.  did you read the documents on that plugin?
[22:23:23] <fattest> duch_kazatel: most ofi t
[22:23:29] <fattest> duch_kazatel: most of it*
[22:23:34] <duch_kazatel> obvioisly not.
[22:23:45] <fattest> duch_kazatel: most*
[22:23:54] <duch_kazatel> dude.
[22:23:54] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery/blob/master/README.md#additional-gallery-elements
[22:23:55] <duch_kazatel> really?
[22:24:07] <duch_kazatel> "It is possible to add additional elements to the Gallery widget, e.g. a description label."
[22:24:18] <duch_kazatel> followed by literal step by step instructions
[22:24:19] <fattest> duch_kazatel: thats all the way at the bottom...i didn't read that much
[22:25:01] <duch_kazatel> dude had you even skimmed the titles you've would've seen it.
[22:28:25] <fattest> duch_kazatel: i still cant get it to work
[22:28:37] <fattest> duch_kazatel: can you put one in the jsfiddle?
[22:28:54] <duch_kazatel> show me what you have broseph
[22:30:09] <fattest> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/2B3bN/21/
[22:32:50] <fattest> duch_kazatel: does it work for you
[22:33:11] <duch_kazatel> fattest i'm fixing it and then i'll send it to you.
[22:33:56] <duch_kazatel> your html is all kinds of funky.
[22:35:19] <fattest> duch_kazatel: atleast its valid
[22:36:47] <duch_kazatel> i'm not sure that it is actually.
[22:47:53] <duch_kazatel> fattest DUDE
[22:48:00] <duch_kazatel> you 100% did not read the docs.
[22:48:18] <duch_kazatel> you were including 2 different modals.
[22:48:42] <fattest> duch_kazatel: how?
[22:48:56] <duch_kazatel> your html
[22:49:31] <fattest> duch_kazatel: no im not
[22:49:45] <fattest> duch_kazatel: i am only including one
[22:50:02] <duch_kazatel> <div class="modal fade"> - that entire div has nothing to do with the gallery you linked me.
[22:50:06] <duch_kazatel> that;s bootstap.
[22:50:55] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/2B3bN/23/
[22:51:01] <duch_kazatel> that gets you pointed in the right direction.
[22:51:14] <duch_kazatel> no idea what you thought you were doing.
[22:51:24] <fattest> duch_kazatel: https://github.com/blueimp/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery#documentation i copied it straight from the documentation
[22:51:46] <fattest> duch_kazatel: its correct
[22:52:06] <duch_kazatel> so you want to use bootstraps implementation.
[22:53:17] <fattest> duch_kazatel: indeed
[22:57:53] <Lope> I need to manage the rows and columns of a table with jQuery. is there any particularly good way to do it?
[23:01:36] <fattest> duch_kazatel: i've been trying to figure it out...i still can't get it to work
[23:04:57] <fattest> duch_kazatel: hows urs going
[23:13:19] <duch_kazatel> fattest http://jsfiddle.net/2B3bN/25/
[23:14:23] <duch_kazatel> and that's why i don't use bootstrap
[23:16:31] <duch_kazatel> fattest you're welcome.
[23:20:22] <fattest> duch_kazaten: thank you so so much
[23:20:30] <fattest> duch_kazaten: you are the greatest!!
[23:35:53] <fattest> are you still here?
[23:36:12] <Amirh> hi
[23:36:43] <Amirh> I need to make the content of a textarea invisible not the textarea itself. is this a way?
[23:37:18] <Uhkis> set the textarea disabled and use the same font color as the background?
[23:38:10] <Amirh> sounds working
[23:38:29] <Amirh> have to try it.
[23:39:08] <Uhkis> the actual content is still in the html  tho
[23:43:34] <fattest> Uhkis: are you any good with bootstrap
[23:53:57] <HelperW> Hi
[23:54:08] <HelperW> Is it possible to remove styling from a class/div/element?
[23:54:16] <HelperW> Not with removeClass but as in remove everything.
[23:54:35] <Cork> HelperW: you would have to set every value that exist on the element
[23:54:51] <Cork> there is a new css property on the way, but not supported yet
[23:54:53] <Cork> (unset)
[23:54:59] <Cork> all: unset;
[23:55:14] <Cork> ?mdn css all
[23:55:16] <b-ot> Cork: CSS reference - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference
[23:55:22] <Cork> hmm not documented yet...
[23:55:49] <HelperW> I guess I can't use that.
[23:56:06] <Cork> nope
[23:56:22] <Cork> the first solution is all that exists today
[23:56:25] <Cork> http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-cascade/#all-shorthand
[23:56:35] <Cork> http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-cascade/#valuedef-unset
[23:56:56] <Cork> well some browsers have it implemented
[23:57:03] <Cork> but it is quite a way from cross browser
