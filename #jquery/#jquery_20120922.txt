[00:08:30] <GoSox> can you use this syntax to add items in an array with an automatic index? $array[] = "string";
[00:10:05] <aro> sox lost!
[00:10:10] <aro> the gap narrows!
[00:10:12] <GoSox> thats all they EVERY do :(
[00:10:15] <GoSox> EVER*
[00:10:40] <aro> winning the central division is our only hopes of getting to the post season
[00:10:46] <GoSox> hopefully that Pats have a titletown kind of year and we forget about sox '12
[00:10:58] <GoSox> wrong sox foo!
[00:11:03] <aro> ooo
[00:11:05] <aro> u r red
[00:11:12] <aro> i didnt think anyone supported them :P
[00:11:18] <GoSox> this year, no one does
[00:11:22] <aro> LOL
[00:13:27] <ruby_on_tails> is an ajax request broken into multiple parts if there is large data ?
[00:21:10] <kristofers> I'm trying to add a class to a div when clicked on using .click() but i manage to add the class not remove it upon another click
[00:21:22] <aro> ruby_on_tails: i dont think so
[00:21:33] <ruby_on_tails> aro: hmm
[00:21:33] <aro> are your downloads broken into multiple parts when there is a lot of data?
[00:21:48] <aro> same concept
[00:21:53] <ruby_on_tails> aro: hmm ok
[00:22:09] <aro> its just another request to a server and retrieval of data, except its done behind the scenes
[00:24:12] <kristofers> http://jsfiddle.net/vLRXT/
[00:24:29] <aro> kristofers: hang on
[00:24:32] <aro> what r u trying to do?
[00:24:49] <kristofers> Add a class upon clicking on a link and if you click again it removes it
[00:24:55] <kristofers> using .click()
[00:25:05] <aro> what are you adding the class to?
[00:25:08] <kristofers> div
[00:25:20] <aro> well it seems you are adding it to the anchor that calls it
[00:25:26] <GoSox> javascript, PHP, seems like no matter where I am, working with cookies just sucks
[00:25:32] <aro> do you know what the scope of this means
[00:25:34] <kristofers> nevermind the anchor i sent i forgot to delete
[00:25:34] <aro> 'this'
[00:25:46] <aro> do you have an updated version
[00:25:48] <kristofers> let me send you correct
[00:26:20] <blindMoe> kristofers: http://jsfiddle.net/vLRXT/5/
[00:26:42] <SomeoneWeird> GoSox, thats why you don't use cookies :p
[00:27:03] <GoSox> if there was a better way to do what they do, i'd be all over it
[00:27:03] <kristofers> http://jsfiddle.net/vLRXT/7/
[00:27:05] <blindMoe> kristofers: I actually meant this one: http://jsfiddle.net/vLRXT/6/
[00:27:07] <kristofers> i think this is the right one
[00:27:35] <blindMoe> kristofers: what I pasted should show you what you need
[00:27:42] <kristofers> Yes thanks trying it out
[00:28:10] <kristofers> Thanks alot,
[00:28:12] <blindMoe> if you want the class applied to the div do $(this).parent().toggleClass('shown');
[00:28:20] <blindMoe> since the div is the parent element of the 'a'
[00:29:50] <kristofers> alright, thanks for the help
[00:32:34] <GoSox> i keep getting a console error in my jquery.js file
[00:32:42] <aro> what is it
[00:33:01] <GoSox> but i haven't edited it, something i'm doing in my own script must be causing it, it's been working fine for hours/days/months
[00:33:08] <GoSox> "3TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'c.replace(/\=\s*([^'"\]]*)\s*\]/g,"='$1']")')"
[00:33:36] <aro> did you look at what function it is part of?
[00:34:01] <GoSox> what function *what* is part of?
[00:34:09] <aro> the line error in question
[00:34:13] <aro> in jquery.js
[00:34:36] <GoSox> my jquery is minimized, the whole file is 4 lines. and the code above is complete jibberish to me
[00:34:56] <aro> replace your jquery.js with the unminimzied version
[00:34:59] <aro> see where the error is
[00:35:00] <aro> go from there
[00:35:56] <GoSox> ah
[00:36:04] <GoSox> my problem is that remove() doesn't take a callback function
[00:36:11] <aro> :)

[06:24:02] <zygote> i got a real newb question but its frustrating me so i'm seeking help. I'm trying to concat a variable and a string into a new variable that I want to pass as a selector. It just won't work.. something like this:
[06:24:15] <zygote> 			var primaryVideoId = this.id;
[06:24:15] <zygote> 			var primaryVideo = primaryVideoId + "-video";
[06:24:15] <zygote> 			if($("." + primaryVideo).is(":visible")){
[06:24:15] <zygote> 				alert('test');
[06:24:15] <zygote> 			}
[06:24:15] <zygote> 			
[06:29:17] <timing> zygote: you are selecting a class, is that what you want?
[06:29:19] <johnkpaul> zygote: an id needs to be prefixed by #
[06:29:22] <johnkpaul> not a .
[06:29:31] <johnkpaul> also, don't paste into the channel
[06:29:31] <timing> johnkpaul: I think he selects a class based on the id
[06:29:49] <johnkpaul> timing: oh,you're right
[06:29:55] <zygote> ya i want to select a class
[06:30:04] <zygote> the id name is just what derives the class name
[06:30:10] <zygote> when concacted
[06:30:49] <timing> if you console.log the result of the seletor, do you have the element then?
[06:31:34] <zygote> let me try
[06:33:12] <zygote> ok it appears like the this.id is returning undefined
[06:33:49] <zygote> oops let me test in the click fucntion so the 'this' will actually work
[06:34:13] <johnkpaul> zygote: or just pass in the actual id for your test in the console
[06:34:28] <zygote> same hting
[06:34:52] <johnkpaul> ?paste @zygote
[06:34:52] <bot-t> zygote, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:40:18] <zygote> http://jsfiddle.net/X38ng/1/
[06:41:08] <zygote> keep in mind i just started. got the first button working in the primitive way i wanted but started to 'this' to try and get all the buttons working but in a single function
[06:41:50] <JyZyXEL> ideas how to make this only append a single tr: var tr2 = d3.select('#blocks').selectAll().data(blocks).enter().append('tr');
[06:42:06] <JyZyXEL> now it appends a tr for all the block objects
[06:42:10] <JyZyXEL> i just want a single tr
[06:43:52] <zygote> ergh. i posted the html after hitting crt z. the "see-more" class does have the id="viral" in my version
[06:44:09] <JyZyXEL> is was thinking maybe i could reduce the number of objects in "blocks" to one
[06:44:13] <johnkpaul> zygote: this.id == window.id
[06:44:14] <johnkpaul> in your code
[06:44:27] <johnkpaul> it's not the id of ane lement
[06:44:43] <zygote> i trid doing this too $(this).attri("id")
[06:44:46] <zygote> to no avail
[06:44:59] <johnkpaul> zygote: this isn't an element, so that wouldnt work either
[06:45:04] <johnkpaul> looking through your HTML, I see no ids at all
[06:45:13] <johnkpaul> I am confused about what "this.id" is supposed to represent
[06:45:25] <zygote> ya pasted wrong html. the ids are definitely there. i can repaste the proper code. sorry for all the mistakes
[06:45:52] <zygote> what i'm trying to achieve... when someone clicks the "see-more" button i want to grab the id
[06:45:57] <zygote> of the button
[06:45:58] <johnkpaul> hm, ok, even if the ids are there, where you are runnig your code "this" is the window, not a dom element
[06:47:00] <zygote> ya the id's and stuff aren't the problem. i kinda get that i'm using this imporperly, just not sure exactly why
[06:47:11] <johnkpaul> zygote: if you post the real html, I can help you more, but I think that what you really want to do is find the parent "video" element, and then search inside that for it's descendents that match some class name
[06:47:49] <johnkpaul> inside the see more click handle, you can do something like $(this).parents('.video-container').find('.prmary-video').is(':visibile')
[06:48:05] <johnkpaul> I stress the something like, because that's not right at all
[06:50:47] <zygote> http://jsfiddle.net/X38ng/4/
[06:50:50] <zygote> thats should be a little better
[06:52:09] <zygote> johnkpaul, i'll try that out
[06:56:05] <zygote> johnkpaul, the trouble i'm having is i want the selectors to all be as generic as possible so I can minimize my function size and have it apply to all four buttons
[06:57:01] <zygote> so when it comes down to finding hte matching class, i'll run into the same problem im having now where im trying to put together the id of the element thats being selected with some generic string that together makes the specific selector
[06:57:03] <johnkpaul> zygote: your new fiddle still has n o ids
[06:57:09] <johnkpaul> zygote: why use an id then?
[06:57:22] <zygote>             <div id="viral" class="see-more">ONE MORE</div>
[06:57:25] <zygote> no?
[06:57:36] <johnkpaul> oh, that's the "primaryVideoId"?
[06:57:55] <johnkpaul> zygote: you want primaryVideoId to be set to "viral"
[06:57:57] <johnkpaul> ?
[06:59:09] <zygote> i want to be set to the id of each button... im going to add an ID to all the other buttons. the first button's id will be "viral", the second will be "crack", the third will be "animals", etc.
[06:59:37] <zygote> no point adding more ids and stuff until i can get the first one working htough
[06:59:41] <johnkpaul> oh, so it's the same as the id of the see more button
[06:59:41] <johnkpaul> I see
[07:00:05] <johnkpaul> zygote: http://jsfiddle.net/X38ng/5/
[07:00:31] <johnkpaul> try that, now the "this" keyword is bound to the dom element
[07:01:05] <zygote> oh you moved the variables into the click function
[07:01:07] <zygote> is that all?
[07:02:00] <johnkpaul> yes
[07:02:04] <johnkpaul> ^@z
[07:02:06] <johnkpaul> zygote:
[07:02:53] <zygote> makes sense. thanks a lot.
[07:03:26] <johnkpaul> zygote: no problem
[07:07:13] <zygote> my only issue is now i want the click function not uniquely bound to the selector "see-more". i want it bound to "see-more" + this.id
[07:08:17] <johnkpaul> zygote: but your code is looking up using that id, so who cares? it's generic, no?
[07:09:34] <zygote> want the button to the right to work too though and its class is "see-more-crack"
[07:10:12] <johnkpaul> zygote: so add class="see-more see-more-crack"
[07:10:40] <zygote> ya but when you click one, it'll be as if you're click both
[07:11:08] <johnkpaul> why? you're only adding the event to .see-more
[07:11:35] <zygote> ya but im trying to transition the function to work for each video block
[07:11:51] <zygote> i could write a unique click function for each
[07:12:02] <johnkpaul> hm, I don't think I understand zygote
[07:12:05] <zygote> but i thought it would be more concise to figure a way to stuff them into one function
[07:12:13] <johnkpaul> if all of these pieces of html have the same structure, youshould be able to write it generically
[07:12:51] <zygote> ya im sure there is a way. im just not figuring it out. let me write it the long way, and post it here so there is more clarity and you maybe you can give me an idea of how to reduce the four functions into one?
[07:13:19] <VictorBjelkholm> sounds like a good plan
[07:14:57] <johnkpaul> yup
[07:17:33] <sakro_> hello, i have setup a loading animation here on this site http://bmm.websiterocks.com/ in firefox it is ok but in IE it sticks and doesnt fade out ? any help?
[07:19:30] <VictorBjelkholm> sakro_, in Google Chrome also, FYI
[07:20:15] <sakro_> yes victor that too
[07:20:20] <VictorBjelkholm> I get error "Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Console> has no method 'clear' ". Are you sure that console.clear(); exists?
[07:20:53] <sakro_> this is for me?
[07:21:12] <VictorBjelkholm> sakro_, yes... Don't you use any debugger when writing JS?
[07:21:20] <zygote> http://jsfiddle.net/X38ng/7/
[07:21:21] <sakro_> umm i am new to jquery sir
[07:21:30] <zygote> ok thats working but has four function when im quite sure there should be one
[07:21:37] <VictorBjelkholm> sakro_, alright. But do you know Javascript?
[07:21:51] <sakro_> no i dont
[07:21:57] <sakro_> i can do little bit
[07:22:09] <sakro_> i made this seeing a tutorial
[07:24:09] <VictorBjelkholm> have you tried removing the console.clear()?
[07:25:11] <VictorBjelkholm> try learning some more basic Javascript before getting involved in jQuery, it will make everything easier for you in the future. Also check up Firebug or the Console in Chromium, good tools for web development
[07:27:25] <johnkpaul> ?lear
[07:27:27] <johnkpaul> ?learn
[07:27:27] <bot-t> johnkpaul, Michnowicz - http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/+/Michnowicz
[07:27:28] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)

[07:32:02] <ipalaus> anyone doing CSRF prevention with AJAX? I've a simple question: when you do a POST/PUT/DELETE via AJAX just attach the csrf token so I can check it on the backend, but, I need then to update with a new tokenâ€¦ no? What's the best way to do it? That the POST returns a data.token for example and update to a hidden input for example? thank you in advance!
[07:36:16] <zygote> johnkpaul, any ideas?
[07:50:00] <delac> how would I prevent context menu from popping up in a .dialog() ?
[07:53:31] <VictorBjelkholm> delac, http://pastie.org/4780474
[07:56:12] <delac> VictorBjelkholm: ah, thanks! bind works so much better than ".on()"
[07:57:23] * BinaryKitten laughs at that sentament
[07:57:31] <VictorBjelkholm> delac, http://stackoverflow.com/a/8065403/360186
[07:58:37] <BinaryKitten> also .bind actually just calls .on underneath
[07:59:00] <BinaryKitten> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.js  - search for bind: function
[07:59:17] <VictorBjelkholm> yeah, same with live and delegate also
[07:59:33] <VictorBjelkholm> so you will probably be better of with on()
[07:59:42] <delac> well why do they give different results then?
[07:59:52] <VictorBjelkholm> they shouldnt. Any examples?
[08:03:53] <delac> well, this is odd... I tried the on method again and now it works like the bind. But I'm sure I tried it already and at that point the "on" didn't work for the whole dialog but only for the list element inside of it. But now it does.
[08:05:53] <VictorBjelkholm> magic ;)
[08:05:57] <johnkpaul> sorry zygote, not around at the moment
[08:06:00] <johnkpaul> will be back later
[08:06:43] <delac> uh, maybe it was the "div" parameter. I thought I had tried it without it but maybe not then...
[08:10:28] <leotr> hi! i have 2 questions. First: i want to inject jQuery (using a bookmarklet). There is a possibility that site already contains jQuery (maybe old version) so i 1) move window.jQuery and window.$ to some variable 2) set them undefined 3) attach a script to page 4) wait until it loads by checking window.jQuery variable 5) load some other scripts 6) put jQuery to some internal variable 7) restore original jQuery and $. Is this a right way to do it?
[08:14:18] <VictorBjelkholm> check if jQuery or $ exists and are available. If not, init jQuery in no conflict mode. Shouldnt that work?
[08:14:56] <leotr> VictorBjelkholm, well there might be old version of jQuery
[08:15:01] <leotr> i need a new one
[08:15:21] <VictorBjelkholm> just init the new version with noconflict then?
[08:15:44] <leotr> VictorBjelkholm, but how can i be sure if it's loaded?
[08:16:16] <VictorBjelkholm> be sure that the new version is loaded?
[08:16:20] <leotr> yes
[08:17:22] <VictorBjelkholm> check if $ is defined
[08:18:07] <VictorBjelkholm> if you want to dubblecheck that $ is your newer version, check it with $().jquery;
[08:18:12] <pachet> leotr: jQuery.noConflict() will return a reference to whatever instance of jquery you call it on
[08:18:30] <pachet> leotr: so MySuperJqueryClone = jQuery.noConflict()
[08:19:37] <leotr> pachet: yes, it will. The problem is that i'm injecting jQuery library to a page
[08:19:56] <pachet> so?
[08:20:08] <pachet> just call it first
[08:20:24] <pachet> dont bother with all the icky tampering with the globals - leave that to the lib
[08:21:04] <leotr> pachet: page might already have jQuery (some older version) loaded and might use it (setInterval with calls to jQuery)
[08:21:30] <pachet> var alias = jQuery.noConflict(); /* load the second instance, do whatever */ $ = jQuery = alias; /*afterwards*/
[08:22:20] <VictorBjelkholm> but instead of writing $('element').fadeIn() or whatever, use var MyQuery = jQuery.noConflict(); MyQuery('element').fadeIn();
[08:24:38] <leotr> pachet, ah, ok...
[08:24:49] <leotr> thank you, VictorBjelkholm, pachet
[08:25:26] <leotr> second question: By some reason my Chrome 21 shows $.support.boxModel == false
[08:25:27] <VictorBjelkholm> nemas problemas
[08:26:00] <VictorBjelkholm> how do mean by shows?
[08:28:11] <leotr> i'm trying to write cross-browser bookmarklet which puts overlays over images on pages. IE in Quirks mode uses different box model, so i need to adjust position of overlays
[08:29:12] <leotr> so i use $.support.boxModel to find which box model is used
[08:30:27] <leotr> so $.support.boxModel == false for Chrome on some pages... strange...
[08:45:41] <op84> hi - whats the syntax to write a plugin which i can call like $.modal() and not $(element).modal()?
[08:49:13] <leotr> $.fn.modal = function()
[08:50:12] <op84> leotr: thanks
[08:50:51] <leotr> welcome
[09:04:34] <dogmatic69> hi all. I am looking for a good way to build plugin methods that do not act on some DOM element.
[09:04:46] <dogmatic69> any one have examples or know what that is called?
[09:06:24] <sviatovigt> hi
[09:06:55] <sviatovigt> does jquery or javascript itself closes tags?
[09:06:57] <sviatovigt> for example
[09:07:15] <sviatovigt> I try to add with append the div tag
[09:07:36] <sviatovigt> .append('<div class="list-column">')
[09:07:58] <sviatovigt> but the result is: <div class="list-column"></div>
[09:09:45] <dogmatic69> I am trying to do a wrapper for my code on $.ajax() so would like to have $.myAjax() for example.
[09:10:01] <dogmatic69> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring does not seem to mention this type of plugin style.
[09:14:10] <ajpiano> dogmatic69: do you have any specific questions about what you're trying to do?
[09:14:42] <ajpiano> it's pretty much as simple as var serviceWrapper = function() { return $.ajax(options); };
[09:14:43] <dogmatic69> ajpiano: how its done / best practice etc. That guide is good for $('something').myMethod()'s
[09:14:55] <ajpiano> right
[09:15:19] <ajpiano> well, a best practise for wrapping $.ajax in particular is to just make sure you return the $.ajax result from the function
[09:15:27] <ajpiano> then you can leverage the power of the deferred aspect of ajax
[09:15:51] <dogmatic69> Not so worried about $.ajax particularly. more the style of how its coded.
[09:16:40] <ajpiano> var serviceWrapper = function( specificOptions ) { var opts = $.extend( specificOptions, { dataType: "json"}); return $.ajax(optis); };   serviceWrapper({url: "/foo"}).then( function() { console.log(data); })
[09:17:22] <ajpiano> there isn't as much in the way of "style" that pertains to how you write functions that happen to wrap jQuery utility functions
[09:17:47] <ajpiano> $.fn.foo plugins have certain expectations that need to be met so that guide explains how it's done
[09:17:57] <dogmatic69> how is that going to be called? $.serviceWrapper?
[09:18:07] <ajpiano> no, just serviceWrapper()
[09:18:13] <ajpiano> if you put it on $, it would be $.serviceWrapper()
[09:18:18] <dogmatic69> I would like $.myPlugin.method(...);
[09:18:30] <ajpiano> why do you want to store it on window.jQuery ?
[09:18:41] <dogmatic69> consistency
[09:18:44] <ajpiano> is it a plugin for general distribution, or is it actually a piece of your application specifically
[09:18:56] <ajpiano> it's not "consistent" to store your entire application logic using jQuery as a container :)
[09:19:13] <dogmatic69> unless at some point $ is not jquery.
[09:19:23] <ajpiano> no that's not what i'm saying
[09:20:21] <dogmatic69> ajpiano: ok, so just var foo ... in the js file, not within some function scope etc.
[09:20:54] <ajpiano> well, no, i'm not advocating that either, it was just an example
[09:21:14] <ajpiano> realistically if it was my app, i'd have a top level object where various app specific things go
[09:21:20] <ajpiano> so i'd have like var APP = {};
[09:21:34] <dogmatic69> yes
[09:22:04] <ajpiano> and then APP.service = function(opts) {  opts.url = "http://www.remoteserver.com";  return $.ajax(opts);  };
[09:22:18] <dogmatic69> I was not going to make 100 different var's. just a single container with APP.foo() APP.bar()
[09:22:27] <ajpiano> APP.service({url: "/things"}).done(fn)
[09:22:28] <ajpiano> yep
[09:22:29] <dogmatic69> ok.
[09:22:58] <ajpiano> yeah, the point is sure, if something is really a "jQuery Plugin" meant for distribution to random folks, sure, store it in $, etc
[09:23:11] <ajpiano> but a lot of the time people actually are trying to write app logic but just shoving it in jQuery cause they haven't mae a better place for it
[09:23:13] <dogmatic69> what is .done() would that be APP.done?
[09:23:21] <ajpiano> no
[09:23:24] <ajpiano> it's the defered API of ajax
[09:23:37] <ajpiano> in the same way you can do $.ajax().done(fn) etc, etc
[09:23:45] <dogmatic69> fn is callback?
[09:23:50] <ajpiano> you can now do that with your service call to "late-bind" callbacks
[09:23:52] <ajpiano> it's a function ref, yah
[09:24:19] <dogmatic69> I was doing service(url, data, callback) {... sucsess: callback ...}
[09:24:27] <ajpiano> yes, that works too
[09:24:41] <dogmatic69> I think .done() is better though. will use that.
[09:24:43] <ajpiano> but as of jQuery 1.5 ajax implements $.Deferred, so to speak
[09:24:59] <dogmatic69> oh
[09:24:59] <ajpiano> then you can have as many success/fail callbacks as you want, and you don't have to directly pass them to $.ajax at the time of the call
[09:25:07] <dogmatic69> ah
[09:25:10] <ajpiano> so it's good for exactly this type of thing
[09:25:15] <dogmatic69> I have loads of callbacks
[09:25:18] <ajpiano> where you have svc requests you want to make in a unified way
[09:25:41] <dogmatic69> well mostly I am generating charts and each type has a different callback
[09:25:44] <ajpiano> and then let the parts of the app attach the specific clalbacks they need without having to aggregate together all the defaults like a remote url or the data type, etc
[09:26:58] <dogmatic69> ok. Im not the most skilled js coder about, but pretty good with other languages.
[09:27:30] <dogmatic69> I was thinking of doing something like $('foo').chart('pie'); $('foo').chart('line'); etc.
[09:27:51] <dogmatic69> that part I got down mostly off that plugin/Authoring page.
[09:28:38] <dogmatic69> chart() has a the methods for pie / line etc. and sets the url for the data and sends the request with callback to draw the chart.
[09:29:13] <dogmatic69> I just had calbacks = {pie: .., line: ...} and passing "callbacks[type]" along.
[09:29:31] <dogmatic69> would this $.Deferred work for this?
[09:34:26] <ajpiano> dogmatic69: ah
[09:34:31] <ajpiano> i see what you're getting at
[09:34:56] <ajpiano> you're actually looking for more something like the jquery ui widget factory
[09:35:21] <ajpiano> not that deferred won't be part of it, it probably will be useful
[09:35:26] <sviatovigt> does jquery or javascript itself closes tags?
[09:35:42] <sviatovigt> for example
[09:35:44] <ajpiano> dogmatic69: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory
[09:35:44] <sviatovigt> I try to add with append the div tag
[09:35:52] <sviatovigt> .append('<div class="list-column">')
[09:35:56] <sviatovigt> but the result is: <div class="list-column"></div>
[09:36:10] <ajpiano> sviatovigt: jQuery and JavaScript work in terms of elements, not strings of html
[09:36:11] <sviatovigt> does jquery or javascript itself closes tags?
[09:36:25] <ajpiano> when you pass a string like that to jQuery it constructs an actual html element
[09:36:35] <ajpiano> so you can't do DOM manipulation treating the DOM as a string
[09:37:11] <ajpiano> and do things like .append("<div>").append("<p>").append("Hi").append("</p>").append("</div>")
[09:37:16] <ajpiano> ^^ which is basiscally what you're trying to do
[09:37:33] <ajpiano> you have to build the entire html structure and insert it all at once to achieve the desired result
[09:43:01] <dogmatic69> ajpiano: thanks
[09:44:44] <ajpiano> dogmatic69: this documentation isn't technically availalbe yet but http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/
[09:44:50] <ajpiano> will probably be helpful even as it is :p
[09:51:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> !seen skione
[09:51:30] <pachet> ?seen ecky--ptang-zoob
[09:51:31] <bot-t> pachet, Couldn't find "seen ecky--ptang-zoob" in jQuery Docs.
[09:51:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> :o
[09:51:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?seen skione
[09:51:46] <bot-t> ecky--ptang-zoob, Couldn't find "seen skione" in jQuery Docs.
[09:51:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i'm not in the jquery docs? I'm insulted.
[09:52:11] <pachet> maybe next year
[09:52:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> *party hard*
[09:58:16] <dogmatic69> ajpiano: so basically I should build the little chart plugin like http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide9
[09:58:56] <dogmatic69> something like $.widget('dogmatic69.chart', {...
[09:59:05] <ajpiano> yeah, that would be a really long namespace
[09:59:16] <dogmatic69> sure, just an example though
[09:59:19] <ajpiano> you could even create a base "chart" widget and then make the types extend from it
[09:59:24] <dogmatic69> nice
[09:59:45] <ajpiano> $.widget("dog.lineChart", $.dog.chart, {})
[10:00:08] <dogmatic69> ok, and I would do $('.foo').lineChart(); ?
[10:00:16] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:00:36] <dogmatic69> or $('.foo').lineChart({.. options ..});
[10:00:45] <dogmatic69> ok, I think that would work best.
[10:01:06] <ajpiano> then you can define the parts for all the charts once, and then just define how they differ
[10:01:21] <dogmatic69> And inside I wouls still be using APP.myAjaxThingy() ?
[10:01:30] <ajpiano> instead of this monolithic thing that jumbles around and figures out what "type" it is etc etc
[10:01:35] <dogmatic69> yes
[10:01:49] <ajpiano> yep
[10:01:59] <dogmatic69> much closer to php and doing class Chart { ... class LineChart extends Chart { ...
[10:02:12] <ajpiano> you would probably not want to have calls directly to your app's service in the widget's code
[10:02:16] <ajpiano> only in the code that invokes it
[10:02:22] <ajpiano> dogmatic69: yep
[10:02:40] <dogmatic69> how would I do the ajax then?
[10:02:58] <dogmatic69> eg: ajax gets json and for the chart points
[10:03:04] <dogmatic69> oh
[10:03:14] <ajpiano> you still do it, but ideally your widget would only expose callbacks that allow that data source to be configured at the time you make a widget
[10:03:21] <dogmatic69> lineChart({data: APP.myAjax()})?
[10:03:27] <ajpiano> something like that, yeah
[10:03:35] <ajpiano> take a look at how the autocomplete plugin works
[10:03:35] <dogmatic69> would that not be blocking?
[10:03:42] <dogmatic69> in UI?
[10:03:45] <ajpiano> yep
[10:03:49] <dogmatic69> will do
[10:03:51] <dogmatic69> thanks
[10:04:00] * dogmatic69 is almost jQuery ninja now

[10:13:00] <aJacom> anyone's used masonry plugin ? Tips on how to ignore display:none; blocks ?
[10:19:15] <MichMich_> Whoot! My similar-sites algoritm is working! :D /me happy
[10:21:39] <firstclassfunc> can I have the code?
[10:22:46] <dogmatic69> ajpiano: when you are extending, is it possible to call the 'parent'? or you just do it like $.namespace.parent.method()
[10:22:50] <MichMich_> its serverside. and database dependend
[10:22:58] <ajpiano> in 1.9, you can
[10:23:00] <ajpiano> but not in 1.8
[10:23:05] <ajpiano> dogmatic69: 1.9 is coming out pretty soon though
[10:23:14] <ajpiano> and you can easily develop against it
[10:23:18] <dogmatic69> oh, ok
[10:23:22] <dogmatic69> its beta?
[10:23:26] <ajpiano> release candidtate
[10:23:37] <dogmatic69> thats fine.
[10:23:43] <dogmatic69> Ill check it out.
[10:23:51] <dogmatic69> how is the parent call in 1.9 then?
[10:23:52] <ajpiano> http://blog.jqueryui.com/2012/08/jquery-ui-1-9-rc/
[10:24:15] <ajpiano> this.super("method", args) iirc

[10:50:51] <timwis> Hey guys, does anyone know of a good jQuery plugin for table sorting + pagination that fetches data via ajax? Specifically, I need to control the ajax fetch logic.
[10:52:46] <dogmatic69> ajpiano: Final check. Is this the right direction then? http://jsfiddle.net/pgUQa/
[10:53:00] <dogmatic69> Ive not tried it out or anything, just the basic idea there.
[10:54:50] <ajpiano> basic idea seems ok but you will run into trouble
[10:55:00] <ajpiano> cause this.draw() doesn't return a function
[10:55:23] <ajpiano> so you probably want to not call it when you pass it to the super data method
[11:04:16] <GoHuyGo> Is this jQuery plugin only for images? http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/
[11:19:53] <bjensen> how can I check using jquery that a select box is selected or not?

[11:25:58] <timwis> Hey, is there an easy way to convert an array of objects to a regular object? it's one of those [{name: 'foo', value: 'bar'}] arrays, and I'd like to access it via data.foo
[11:27:25] <barraponto> data = data[0]
[11:27:28] <barraponto> timwis: ^^
[11:27:38] <barraponto> or just data[0].foo
[11:28:06] <timwis> barraponto: it's an array of multiple objects though, multiple key/val pairs
[11:28:27] <timwis> [{name: 'foo', value: 'bar'}, {name: 'batman', value: 'robin'}]
[11:33:12] <rmurphey> timwis: so how do you want to convert that to an object?
[11:33:45] <barraponto> rmurphey: i guess he wants to use the "name" property as dictionary key
[11:34:03] <timwis> rmurphey: I'd like to access a particular key in it, so right now all I can do is iterate the array and test if key == mykey. Instead, I'd like to access it via data.mykey (i.e. data.batman) like I would an object
[11:34:27] <rmurphey> timwis: then you'd just need to iterate over the array of objects and create the new object you want
[11:34:35] <rmurphey> $.map may be useful to you for this
[11:35:02] <barraponto> rmurphey: map would return an array. i guess he'll have to go with .reduce()
[11:35:37] <rmurphey> barraponto: good point :)
[11:35:53] <sunbeam> jQuery("</span>").addClass('remaining').appendTo("body.type-post");
[11:35:53] <sunbeam> any idea whats wrong with this?
[11:35:59] <rmurphey> except there isn't $.reduce()
[11:36:14] <sunbeam> body.type-post does exist
[11:36:42] <barraponto> rmurphey: because it's an array native method
[11:36:50] <barraponto> rmurphey: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce
[11:37:20] <rmurphey> i'm aware of .reduce() as an array method, but uncertain of it's support xbrowser
[11:37:25] <GoHuyGo> For SimpleModal, do I just select the container where when I click on it, I want a modal to load?
[11:37:40] <rmurphey> looks like it's not available in ie < 8
[11:37:44] <rmurphey> <= 8 rather
[11:37:53] <barraponto> rmurphey: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce#Compatibility
[11:38:03] <rmurphey> yes i'm there barraponto
[11:38:43] <barraponto> rmurphey: anyway, that's the easiest way to convert that array into an object. but I'm sure there must be other ways.
[11:39:15] <rmurphey> barraponto: yes, i erred in suggesting $.map, complete brain fart on my part, but there are plenty of ways to turn an array into an object
[11:39:26] <rmurphey> however i couldn't read timwis's mind as far as what object he wanted
[11:39:45] <barraponto> the objects in the data array have a "name" property
[11:39:46] <johnkpaul> barraponto: rmurphey chances are, you're using some utility library that will provide xbrowser reduce, either underscore, or the es5 shim in the worst case
[11:40:00] <barraponto> underscore++
[11:40:13] <rmurphey> now that i understand that he wants the name as a key, then, yes, he can either use reduce if xbrowser compatibility doesn't matter, use a library that provides reduce, or just write a stupid simple loop that does it
[11:40:17] <barraponto> _(data).reduce(magic)
[11:40:27] <timwis> no, map worked
[11:41:03] <barraponto> underscore is lots of joy crammed into 3kb.
[11:41:06] <timwis> rmurphey barraponto this works great http://codepad.org/XXNJQ062
[11:41:18] <rmurphey> timwis: no need to use map there
[11:41:21] <rmurphey> just use $.each
[11:41:29] <timwis> oh yeah, duh
[11:41:42] <rmurphey> which is what i should have said from the get-go
[11:41:43] <barraponto> timwis: you're not using .map, you're using .each
[12:03:31] <sunbeam> I want to use NobleCount to keep track of how much characters a user can type in tinymyce
[12:03:34] <sunbeam> however, which textarea field should i keep track of?
[12:10:18] <danheberden> sunbeam: i'm not sure on the exect api call, but tinymce has a method to get the dom element/text-area that you can then bind to. Keep in mind you'll have to deal with the markup characters as well.
[12:13:10] <sunbeam> danheberden: hmm this is in Wordpress
[12:13:32] <danheberden> i'm not sure that has any bearing sunbeam?
[12:13:41] <danheberden> it's still javascript and tinymce, ya?
[12:13:43] <danheberden> :D
[12:16:52] <sunbeam> ehm yea

[12:46:30] <GoHuyGo> still no pop up :(
[12:47:34] <Meiwes> you want when one clicks an image....
[12:48:14] <GoHuyGo> I changed it for this case
[12:48:21] <GoHuyGo> I guess I could substitute an image
[12:48:37] <Meiwes> explain what u want done,if u dont mind
[12:48:54] <GoHuyGo> basically, when I click on .photo_container
[12:49:02] <GoHuyGo> I want the text in #basic_modal to pop up in a modal
[12:52:57] <Meiwes> hang on
[12:53:59] <Meiwes> can  .photo_container be the class of a button or hyperlink?
[12:53:59] <victorbjelkholm> sure thing
[12:54:12] <GoHuyGo> does it have to?
[12:54:45] <Meiwes> nope,you just want the text?
[12:54:58] <GoHuyGo> I figure it doesn't matter
[12:55:03] <GoHuyGo> we can do button or hyperlink if it's easier for you
[12:55:08] <GoHuyGo> in my project
[12:55:10] <GoHuyGo> it's an image file
[12:55:12] <GoHuyGo> err
[12:55:13] <GoHuyGo> an image
[12:55:15] <GoHuyGo> when I click on an image
[12:55:20] <GoHuyGo> it basically loads up a modal
[12:55:27] <GoHuyGo> but I'm just trying to get the jquery script to work
[12:56:21] <Meiwes> thats easy

[13:03:58] <GoHuyGo> got to run
[13:03:59] <dogmatic69> I am trying to build a plugin using the UI widget factory and doing an ajax request using a callback as this.my_callback. in my_callback() function 'this' is 'window'
[13:04:01] <GoHuyGo> I'm playign with it
[13:04:07] <GoHuyGo> Meiwes: Thank you for your help so far
[13:04:11] <GoHuyGo> Adios
[13:04:17] <dogmatic69> why is 'this' not the object anymore?
[13:09:02] <Eviltwin> dogmatic69: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.proxy/
[13:11:11] <dogmatic69> Eviltwin: seems like what I need. Just not sure how to use that.
[13:39:34] <dogmatic69> How can I use $.proxy() so that _build() has 'this' is not 'window' http://jsfiddle.net/c7dg4/
[13:40:39] <dogmatic69> chain: _create() -> draw() -> data() -> ajax callback -> _build()
[13:41:08] <dogmatic69> I can pass 'this' around, but would prefer a cleaner solution
[13:45:43] <ddssc> dogmatic69, you should always pass 'this' around
[13:45:51] <ddssc> unless you wanna bogart it like a twat
[13:47:12] <dogmatic69> ddssc: really? I would have thought passing 'this' around is bad.
[13:47:22] <dogmatic69> why would they have the proxy stuff?
[13:47:41] <ddssc> dogmatic69 always pass 'this' and by 'this' I mean that. and by that I mean that shit.
[14:04:07] <jammsen> is there a event for jquery that i can check if the user views my page actually in a tab?
[14:04:13] <jarred> I have a div that has "Some text here" inside it. When the user highlights part of it, I want to wrap a div around that part. So, the div would look like, "<div><div class='highlighted'>some text</div> here</div>" I know how to get highlighted text, but what's a good way of adding an element inside of another element at a specific place? (Rather than appending it or prepending it)
[14:04:26] <jammsen> i dont want to slideUp and Down and crash the users browser
[14:05:59] <jammsen> Is there a event for jquery that i can check if the user views my page actually in a tab? I dont want to slideUp and Down massive times and the users does views that tab for hours and because of that crash the users browser. :(
[14:20:33] <Eviltwin> jammsen: Read about what the focus and blur events mean for the "window": http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/blurfocus.html
[14:36:14] <jammsen> Eviltwin: do i have to use jquery syntax on window or just the window object?
[14:36:26] <jammsen> i mean $(window).blur?
[14:38:25] <diegoviola> hi
[14:39:32] <diegoviola> i have an app that is firing background processes to do some processing work like downloading images and processing them later with imagemagick, this works grea, however, i'd like to notify the parent process that the background processes have completed, i could use jquery and polling with ajax, but i don't want to hit hte DB every X time
[14:39:52] <diegoviola> is there a way to use websockets and have the background processes send data to the browser directly?
[14:40:24] <diegoviola> i'm not at all familiar with websockets, sorry
[14:42:18] <diegoviola> i'd like to avoid going to the server and then db and then back and forth, i wish i could just establish a connection and send data from the background processes to my brwoser... since i don't need to keep state in a db for my notifications
[14:45:18] <Eviltwin> diegoviola: Then you're going to want to use a backend language with state
[14:45:25] <Eviltwin> PHP is designed to be stateless
[14:46:09] <diegoviola> i'm using ruby
[14:46:30] <diegoviola> i just want to know if websockets will allow me to open a connection in a browser so that i can send data from different processes
[14:47:50] <Eviltwin> Have you used AJAX before?
[14:48:05] <diegoviola> yes
[14:48:17] <diegoviola> very little though
[14:49:02] <Eviltwin> So the premise of a WebSocket is essentially a back-and-forth in AJAX
[14:49:09] <Eviltwin> Instead of a one time send then receive
[14:49:58] <diegoviola> but with ajax i need to be hitting my werbserver no? i want to send data to the browser from my background processes directly...
[14:50:49] <diegoviola> or from any process via sockets...
[15:10:30] <wingy> interesting .. jquery mobile is sending html to the browser not data
[15:10:38] <wingy> so it will work when js is disabled
[15:46:16] <zmbmartin> I have overflow hidden on body but scroll elements that go longer then the body. How do I detect scrollTop and scrollBottom of my element?
[15:56:25] <teear> moro

[16:32:49] <sunbeam> I've got a <th> that contains a <label for="something">
[16:32:58] <sunbeam> I want to access the th thats containing the label
[16:33:03] <sunbeam> i only know for="something"
[16:33:08] <sunbeam> how can i do this best in jquery
[16:33:33] <diegoviola> with websockets i could send data to the browser directly, in theory, right?
[16:33:44] <diegoviola> from any socket connection
[16:33:48] <diegoviola> or process
[16:35:57] <Eviltwin> sunbeam: $('label[for="something"]').closest("th")
[16:36:00] <Eviltwin> Probably
[16:36:05] <sunbeam> ok
[16:39:10] <teear> wtf
[16:39:31] <teear> i need to learn jquery, in css you cannot target the parent
[16:41:28] <ravenzz> ..
[16:53:29] <victorbjelkholm> teear, well, in Selectors Level 4 Spec, there is a way to target parent http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-selectors4-20110929/#subject
[16:55:30] <javalover> hi i'm using .load in order to pass variables to my php file.  I'm having trouble understanding how to pass my array
[16:56:15] <javalover> right now I have .load("myphp.php",{ 'choices[]': [mychoice1,mychoice2,mychoice3]}
[16:56:34] <javalover> the problem i'm having is that my array that I want to pass actually has things like myarray["picture"]
[16:56:47] <javalover> so how do I put that into the .load call?
[16:57:23] <javalover> essentially i'd like to do this var mychoices = [];  mychoices["picture"] = "http://www.mysite.com/jpeg.jpg";
[16:57:50] <javalover> .load("myfile.php",{ 'choices[]' : mychoices}
[16:59:05] <javalover> hmm idea hold on
[17:00:54] <javalover> yeah so still lost
[17:01:25] <javalover> I thought maybe how i'm passing it is wrong but that's not it...
[17:02:50] <javalover> like am I only able to pass to .load with arrays that consist of int?
[17:03:58] <javalover> cuz I did this var myarray = []; myarray[0] = "hello world"; .load("myfile.php",{"mytest":myarray}   and then I called echo $mytest[0]  prints: hello world;
[17:04:17] <javalover> I wanna do the same exact thing only on an array that has like myarray["hi"]
[17:05:39] <javalover> can't seem to work ...... ARGHHH!!!
[17:06:28] <arielserafini> javalover: what you want is an Object, not an Array
[17:07:34] <javalover> ok...
[17:07:40] <javalover> so how would I convert this into an object?
[17:07:52] <javalover> sorry i'm used to doing that in java...
[17:07:57] <javalover> i've never really done that in javascript
[17:08:00] <arielserafini> javalover: using myArray["something"] adds a property to the array
[17:08:04] <arielserafini> but not an index
[17:08:12] <javalover> oh...
[17:08:13] <arielserafini> if you test myArray.length it will return 0
[17:08:15] <javalover> where does it go then?
[17:08:17] <javalover> oh wow
[17:08:18] <arielserafini> it's weird like that
[17:08:27] <javalover> ok so real quick then
[17:08:31] <javalover> how can I make just a test object to pass
[17:08:39] <arielserafini> arrays only work with ints, like you said
[17:09:07] <javalover> im' okay with it i just create the object
[17:09:14] <javalover> least I understand now why it doesn't work
[17:09:21] <arielserafini> I *THINK* .load() accepts objects as well
[17:09:28] <javalover> it's okay I can test it
[17:09:33] <javalover> and last resort, I just convert my array into index
[17:09:46] <javalover> i'm okay with it...I just wanted to see if it was that I didn' tunderstand
[17:09:50] <javalover> now I know it just won't allow for it
[17:09:52] <arielserafini> you an use myObj = {}
[17:10:00] <arielserafini> and then use it exactly how you were using it before
[17:10:07] <javalover> da fuaq
[17:10:17] <arielserafini> myObj["something"]
[17:10:26] <javalover> lol stfu
[17:10:27] <javalover> no
[17:10:28] <javalover> no way
[17:10:29] <javalover> really!?
[17:10:32] <javalover> so [] not ok
[17:10:35] <javalover> {} ok?
[17:10:37] <arielserafini> yes
[17:10:40] <javalover> STFU!
[17:10:41] <arielserafini> [] = Array
[17:10:44] <arielserafini> {} = Object
[17:10:53] <javalover> oooooooooooooooooo mmmmmmmmmmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy GAWD
[17:10:55] <arielserafini> OR you can do myObj = {myProp: "value"  }
[17:11:14] <javalover> i'm turning green
[17:11:15] <javalover> lol
[17:11:24] <sunbeam> how can I find a <th><label> that's empty its tr?
[17:11:40] <javalover> ok hold on lemme test
[17:11:52] <javalover> thx for the info but wow that just blows my mind
[17:16:19] <xsamurai> Can someone take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/YNzHk/
[17:17:02] <xsamurai> I want to use id to match instead of name but id doesn't work
[17:19:18] <javalover> OMG IT OWRKED!
[17:19:19] <sunbeam> how can i check whether the content of ".something" is between 0 and 100 ?
[17:19:20] <javalover> WURKS
[17:19:25] <javalover> WORKEESOIUDOIUDOIDUDIODUDOIU HOLY WOWWWWWWWWWW
[17:19:33] <sunbeam> its a digit <span class="something">100</span>
[17:19:48] <danheberden> sunbeam: get the contents, make sure it's a number, check
[17:20:21] <beachandbytes> if(Number($('.something).text()') > 0 && Number(%('.something').text()) < 100)
[17:20:41] <danheberden> beachandbytes: why would you query the dom twice? :/
[17:21:07] <danheberden> var check = Number( $('.something').text() ); if ( check ...
[17:21:17] <beachandbytes> cuz faster to type on one line
[17:21:17] <danheberden> or parseInt( $('.something').text(), 10 );
[17:21:30] <sunbeam> sec
[17:21:36] <sunbeam> ill start with what beachandbytes said :p
[17:22:07] <beachandbytes> danheberden way is faster :)
[17:22:07] <danheberden> ?eval [ "if(Number($('.something).text()') > 0 && Number(%('.something').text()) < 100)".length, "var check = Number( $('.something').text() ); if ( check > 0 && check < 100 )".length ]
[17:22:15] <bot-t> danheberden: [78, 77]
[17:22:19] <zmbmartin> I am trying to use the scroll event but it triggers a number of times per scroll can I have it fire once per scroll?
[17:22:30] <danheberden> so my way has spacing and it's still 1 char smaller
[17:22:46] <danheberden> i'm being an ass to make sure y'all cache yo' shit!
[17:22:47] <danheberden> :D
[17:24:06] <sunbeam> maybe something better
[17:24:16] <sunbeam> would it be possible, to disable a user from inputting text in a textarea
[17:24:22] <sunbeam> if that value is not between 0 and 100?
[17:24:37] <danheberden> you control the DOM sir
[17:24:44] <sunbeam> or actually, is below 0
[17:24:46] <danheberden> setting .prop('readonly', true )
[17:24:52] <danheberden> is in your power
[17:24:53] <sunbeam> ok
[17:24:55] <danheberden> :D
[17:25:07] <sunbeam> its not .attribute?
[17:25:13] <sunbeam> .attr
[17:25:14] <sunbeam> i mean
[17:26:28] <danheberden> ?eval var ta = document.createElement('textarea'); ta.hasOwnProperty('readOnly');
[17:26:31] <bot-t> danheberden: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[17:26:36] <danheberden> bot-t :(
[17:26:46] <danheberden> sunbeam: it's an attribute when you specify it in your markup
[17:26:56] <danheberden> <textarea readonly="true"...
[17:27:06] <danheberden> but the representation of that fact? that's a property on the DOM node
[17:27:17] <danheberden> i'm pretty sure using .attr or .prop would work just fine
[17:27:34] <danheberden> because there are hooks in place for those that want .attr to work like .prop
[17:27:50] <danheberden> but you aren't working with the markup anymore, you're working with the actual element
[17:27:53] <danheberden> thus, its properties
[17:28:24] <sunbeam> ok
[17:28:37] <danheberden> ?eval var $ta = $( '<textarea readonly="true">' ); $ta.prop('readonly');
[17:28:40] <bot-t> danheberden: TypeError: div is undefined
[17:28:43] <danheberden> haha
[17:28:50] <danheberden> ok bot-t, i'll stop trying to make dom elements
[17:29:07] <danheberden> or does it need the closing tag, never made a textarea like that
[17:29:14] <danheberden> ?eval var $ta = $( '<textarea readonly="true"></textarea>' ); $ta.prop('readonly');
[17:29:17] <bot-t> danheberden: TypeError: div is undefined
[17:30:19] <sunbeam> if(Number(jQuery('.remaining').text() < 0)) { // something }
[17:30:23] <sunbeam> hmm
[17:30:32] <sunbeam> i guess i should use a live function right?
[17:30:44] <sunbeam> its a textarea counting down the characters typed
[17:33:33] <beachandbytes> $(.remaining).on("keydown", function () {  if($(this).text().length() > 100)  { $(this).text($(this).text().substring(0,100));}});
[17:33:55] <danheberden> all that $(this) makes me so sad :(
[17:34:32] <beachandbytes> lol set a local var if you want :)
[17:35:12] <danheberden> i strongly encourage you to do so even in your sample code to express points
[17:35:17] <danheberden> as there are those not too versed in JS here
[17:35:25] <danheberden> that will think using $(this).text() all over is a great idea
[17:35:33] <danheberden> and not understand that a) it will suck to maintain and b) it's slow
[17:35:40] <sunbeam> beachandbytes: .remaining isn't the textarea
[17:35:57] <danheberden> haha
[17:36:48] <beachandbytes> well what is .remaining?\
[17:38:06] <sunbeam> thats where i keep track of how much chars remainig
[17:40:18] <beachandbytes> $(.remaining).on("change",function () { var ta = $('textarea');if(ta.length > 100 || ta.length < 0){ ta.text(ta.text().substring(0,100)); }});
[17:40:26] <beachandbytes> iseems much less readable for irc
[17:48:11] <sunbeam> jQuery('.remaining').on("change",function () { }
[17:48:13] <sunbeam> doesn't work
[17:49:08] <sunbeam> jQuery('.remaining').on("change",function () { alert("test"); }
[17:56:37] <sunbeam> beachandbytes: any idea
[18:00:42] <zmbmartin> Can I reset $().one ?
[18:01:13] <zmbmartin> I want to attach a function to scroll but I only want it to fire once within a 2 second period?
[18:01:23] <danheberden> zmbmartin: i'd use throttle instead
[18:01:29] <danheberden> ?g throttle ben_alman
[18:01:30] <bot-t> danheberden, Ben Alman » jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[18:01:38] <danheberden> and set the ms to 2000
[18:02:02] <zmbmartin> danheberden: OK cool thanks I will check it out.
[18:04:13] <sunbeam> danheberden: it seems that it's not possible to use .on change on a textarea
[18:04:28] <sunbeam> jQuery('#description').prop("readonly", "false");
[18:04:40] <sunbeam> this will only be applied when I leave the textarea and am not focused anymore
[18:05:10] <danheberden> sunbeam: yeah, i think beachandbytes eluded to that with keydown
[18:05:48] <sunbeam> ahhh
[18:07:44] <sunbeam> but the issue is
[18:07:50] <sunbeam> jQuery('#description').prop("readonly", "false");
[18:07:52] <sunbeam> when i set this
[18:08:02] <sunbeam> it will not be possible anymore for the user to remove text
[18:08:43] <sunbeam> from the textarea
[18:11:36] <sunbeam> any ideas how i can fix that
[18:18:29] <shoky> sunbeam: what?
[18:30:43] <victorbjelkholm> how about .removeProp() ?
[18:40:44] <codeshah> hey guys, I have a css flyout menu, and want to detect when a menu pops up [div becomes visible] how do I do this?

[20:08:33] <GoHuyGo> I assumed it was
[20:09:13] <arielserafini> you assumed it was being fired or it was a rails thing?
[20:09:27] <GoHuyGo> if I copy that snippet and add it to my view directly
[20:09:48] <GoHuyGo> page loads fine, but modal only shows 1 image
[20:10:05] <GoHuyGo> so I'm trying to use jQuery to alter the modal when it is clicked
[20:10:17] <GoHuyGo> but rails can't find the object photo
[20:10:53] <GoHuyGo> I'm not sure if my jquery code is wrong
[20:11:00] <GoHuyGo> or if there's some error in rails
[20:11:29] <arielserafini> GoHuyGo: where are you seeing that error message?
[20:11:39] <arielserafini> undefined local variable (...) ?
[20:12:34] <GoHuyGo> arielserafini: on my view when I try to load the index page
[20:12:50] <arielserafini> so it's a rails error
[20:13:03] <GoHuyGo> k
[20:22:07] <SrPx> How to sum the width of every children of an object? total_width = 0; $('#my_object').children().each(function(){ total_width += $(this).width(); }); // is there something like that ?
[20:23:41] <ex-parrot> hey all.... what would cause $('#some-span').height() to return 0?
[20:23:52] <ex-parrot> does .height() only work on elements with a defined height?
[20:34:24] <Matt_P> how does one use the .submit() call back when you have no submit button? (just too fields ad pressing enter)
[20:34:33] <Matt_P> do i need to hook the enter key on each field ?
[20:34:59] <astropirate> key up event
[20:35:51] <Matt_P> when there is a <input type="submit" />, it works as desired
[20:36:02] <Matt_P> is the keyup the only workaround when you have no submit input ?
[20:37:01] <Matt_P> Depending on the browser, the Enter key may only cause a form submission if the form has exactly one text field, or only when there is a submit button present. The interface should not rely on a particular behavior for this key unless the issue is forced by observing the keypress event for presses of the Enter key.
[20:37:03] <Matt_P> ok
[20:37:07] <Matt_P> thanks asido
[20:37:11] <Matt_P> astropirate, *
[20:37:11] <Matt_P> lo
[20:52:23] <b1lly> Matt_P:  just use eventlistener and trigger $('form').submit()
[20:53:00] <Matt_P> $('.input').keypress(function(e) { ??
[21:19:11] <wingy> how do you check if a certain element is in the body and if yes, run a logic?
[21:19:43] <wingy> if ($('selector')) {...} ?
[21:21:12] <arielserafini> wingy: if ( $('selector').length )
[21:23:58] <wingy> arielserafini: thx
[21:38:31] <Matt_P> so how do you apply something to multiple elements?
[21:38:43] <Matt_P> #login_email is in <form id="loginform">
[21:38:54] <b1lly> wingy: what you did is fine
[21:38:55] <Matt_P> i just want to apply it to all inputs
[21:39:21] <Matt_P> $('$loginform input')
[21:39:21] <b1lly> $('input').
[21:39:22] <Matt_P> ?
[21:39:36] <b1lly> $('#loginform input')
[21:39:37] <Matt_P> i only want it on inputs in that specific form
[21:39:45] <Matt_P> thanks ill give it a try
[21:45:42] <harbhub> hey fellas
[21:45:49] <harbhub> have a question regarding ajax
[21:46:13] <harbhub> i'm making a POST request to a server, and I am receiving the request and printing the request headers
[21:46:30] <harbhub> how do i print the data that is sent?
[21:47:07] <systemfault> You mean the response from the server?
[21:47:17] <harbhub> not yet
[21:47:25] <harbhub> i want to get there soon
[21:47:32] <harbhub> but for now i passed data to the ajax using
[21:47:45] <systemfault> You should already know the content of the request since you're the one doing it
[21:47:55] <systemfault>  That's the part I don't get.
[21:48:21] <harbhub> $.ajax({url:'localhost:8888/posthere', method:'POST', data:{name: 'Mike', something: 'somevalue'})
[21:48:53] <harbhub> yeah i retrieve the content length it says
[21:48:59] <harbhub> but the actual data doesnt pop up
[21:49:07] <harbhub> am i missing additional settings?
[21:49:32] <systemfault> Well, AFAIK, there's no "method" param
[21:49:37] <harbhub> http://jsfiddle.net/harbhub/XdsLg/1/
[21:49:39] <systemfault> It's "type"
[21:49:44] <harbhub> yeah i meant type
[21:49:55] <harbhub> check my fiddle please, that is what i am doing
[21:50:04] <harbhub> next step will be to pass that var into the data i sent
[21:50:06] <harbhub> :)
[21:50:14] <harbhub> but first i need to actually receive data lol
[21:50:19] <tw2113> no success callback
[21:50:35] <harbhub> oh
[21:50:38] <harbhub> let me try that
[21:51:21] <systemfault> Also, IIRC, the default behavior of a <button> tag is to submit a form, you might not want that if you don't actually have a form
[21:51:39] <systemfault> <button type="button">Bleh</button> should do it
[21:51:48] <harbhub> http://jsfiddle.net/harbhub/XdsLg/2/
[21:52:26] <harbhub> i want to send the ajax on an event, so for now the click event lol
[21:52:35] <harbhub> remember this is literally my first time using ajax
[21:52:35] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/XdsLg/3/
[21:52:42] <systemfault> That's the new good way,.
[21:52:58] <harbhub> ok but
[21:53:04] <harbhub> i want to use the data on the serverside
[21:53:08] <harbhub> i'm running a node server
[21:53:19] <harbhub> so i imagine it sends the data as an object
[21:53:22] <systemfault> Then you should be able to get the post data from the server.
[21:53:26] <harbhub> then i can pick apart the object?
[21:53:39] <harbhub> ok i have the server listening for that request
[21:53:39] <Matt_P> forgot to actualy use myData
[21:53:40] <Matt_P> :P
[21:53:44] <harbhub> and logging the headers
[21:54:19] <systemfault> The default is to send the post data as urlencoded form data
[21:54:32] <systemfault> It won't be an object.
[21:54:53] <systemfault> Your node framework should be able to deal with urlencoded form data
[21:58:02] <harbhub> hmm
[21:58:10] <harbhub> so it is the serverside issue i suppose
[22:01:32] <mdunham918_> hey guys would it be possible to make an ajax call to a php script have that php script poll for new data and as it sees the new data have it echo out the data, but keep the connection open. I'd like my ajax request to see the response even though the connection is still active and pass that received data off to a processor.
[22:01:54] <mdunham918_> that way its long polling but without all the extra requests of killing the connection after each piece of data to send
[22:02:16] <mdunham918_> i've seen this done with standard XmlHttpRequest in the past but how would that be do able with jgXHR
[22:03:00] <mdunham918_> i thought I saw a deal once one $.ajax that let you access received data as it comes in but can't find it
[22:03:20] <Lucky--> php def not the framework to do it in
[22:03:41] <Lucky--> mdunham one thing that i've done is put poll a the success complete function
[22:43:15] <wingy> is there a way to "mark" an element so i know that i have done certain logic on it?
[22:44:23] <phiz> i don't know if it's a good idea or not you could add a data-attribute to it
[22:46:02] <phiz> i am trying to display a tooltip that is retrieved via ajax.  seems to not work until i hover over an element for the second time.
[22:47:22] <wingy> phiz: good idea
[22:47:30] <wingy> really straight forward
[22:48:28] <phiz> basically doing $(parent).on("mouseover", "tr", function(event) { $.ajax( ... ).done(function(response) { $("td").tooltip(...) })
[22:48:36] <phiz> any ideas or will something like that not work
[22:49:04] <blendedbychris> what function do i need to do to simply replace an element with another
[22:49:21] <blendedbychris> replaceWith() ?
[22:50:23] <callmekatootie> you mean all occurrences of that element?
[22:50:36] <callmekatootie> or do you happen to know the location of the element that you want to replace in the DOM?
[22:51:37] <arielserafini> ?tias
[22:51:37] <bot-t> Try It And See
[23:07:21] <phiz> anyone?
[23:11:38] <SrPx> How do I include multiple scripts and do something when they are loaded?
[23:23:04] <chovy> does $.post support             context: this,
[23:23:07] <chovy> param?
