[00:00:17] <Eviltwin> You want to append a selector?
[00:00:27] <bugsy[afk]> yep
[00:00:32] <Eviltwin> What does that mean?
[00:00:47] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: you should be prefixing your custom data attributes
[00:00:57] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: data-offset='30'
[00:01:34] <bugsy[afk]> i want to extract from 'data' some selector and append its content to my page in browser
[00:02:05] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: but for what?
[00:02:05] <Eviltwin> You do know what a selector is, right?
[00:02:05] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: thats line of code i showed you does exactly that
[00:02:46] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: i meant <button id='post' offset='30'>MOAR</button> should be <button id='post' data-offset='30'>MOAR</button>
[00:03:09] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: html has a reserved namespace for none standard attributes, and you should be using it
[00:03:34] <bugsy[afk]> Eviltwin: $( data ).find( '#cont' ); CONT is selector? (sorry for my english)
[00:04:10] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: hmm...
[00:05:17] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: if your using unprefiex attributes you might actually hit an attribute that a browser might use somewhere in the future
[00:05:41] <Cork> data-* is garateed to never do that
[00:05:48] <coldhead> that's pretty much how world war 1 started
[00:05:55] <coldhead> unprefixed attributes
[00:06:06] <Cork> heh
[00:06:10] <coldhead> data-archduke-ferndinand and everything would have been fine
[00:09:03] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: 'data-' not help :(
[00:09:35] <bugsy[afk]> i mean it`s not problem now
[00:10:14] * bugsy[afk] reading .ajax()
[00:21:06] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: exactly "$(parent).html($(data).find('#selector'))" it`s not working! becoz .find() returns object Window!
[00:22:04] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: ah right, you have the complete html in the response right?
[00:22:18] <Cork> that it including the doctype and everything?
[00:22:43] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: yeap!
[00:22:54] <bugsy[afk]> oh no!
[00:23:03] <Cork> ?
[00:23:04] <bugsy[afk]> not doctype
[00:23:11] <bugsy[afk]> only html
[00:23:22] <Cork> uh...
[00:23:30] <Cork> do you include header/body?
[00:23:36] <Cork> *head
[00:23:56] <bugsy[afk]> wait a second i`ll make screenshot
[00:24:21] <Cork> (a pb would have been nicer)
[00:25:33] <rabbi1> hey all, i am using jquery dynamic forms to create a clone, how can i get those data into form in asp.net ?
[00:30:11] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: http://i.imgur.com/ZX3vF.png look to 'data' in bottom-right window :)
[00:30:54] <Cork> ?p @ bugsy[afk]
[00:30:54] <bot-t> bugsy[afk], Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:31:53] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: what about 'php'-part?
[00:32:08] <Cork> use the generated html
[00:32:33] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: i mean what about POST?
[00:32:52] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: just leave it, and we'll simulate it
[00:33:05] <Cork> but include the response in a section somewhere
[00:33:15] <bugsy[afk]> okay...
[00:36:02] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/WqDbs/
[00:37:11] <Cork> bugsy[afk]:  the generated html response?
[00:38:51] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: it`s just example. html and html-response the same
[00:39:50] <rabbi1> i am using jquery dynamic forms to create a clone, how can i get those data into form in asp.net ?
[00:39:57] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: and your sending everything you have up in the html section?
[00:41:37] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: i sending only 'offset'-attr. i get whole html-response. i want some content from html-response to appent to my html
[00:41:52] <Cork> sigh
[00:41:59] <Cork> yes but i need to see the data you get back
[00:43:51] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: it`s totally identical to my html, but POSTed data included ('offset'). just look to my screenshot :)
[00:45:43] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: is both pages in quirks mode?
[00:45:46] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: imagine a blog-posts. 20 posts per page. on page bottom is <button offset='current-offset-value'>moar!!!</button>. by click on this button .load() next 20 posts
[00:46:09] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: quirks mode == missing doctype
[00:46:17] <bugsy[afk]> yep
[00:46:22] <Cork> ...
[00:46:24] <bugsy[afk]> no doctype here
[00:46:41] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: ok, then you should start by running your page through w3cs validator
[00:46:53] <Cork> and add a doctype to you pages
[00:46:58] <Cork> <!doctype html> should suffice
[00:47:05] <bugsy[afk]> okay...
[00:47:43] <haizum> im getting a re-execute loop when trying to use delegate like this:
[00:47:46] <haizum> $("#container").delegate(".attachment-portfoliosmall", "inview", function() {
[00:47:49] <haizum> any idea why?
[00:48:01] <haizum> page has 32 items on it and its executing the function 32 times on the entire set of elements
[00:48:16] <haizum> i want it to just execute when they're in view, and then stop
[00:48:35] <Cork> haizum: whats generating the "inview" event?
[00:49:35] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: well... still not working )))
[00:49:40] <haizum> Cork: i thought that *was* the event?
[00:49:55] <Cork> haizum: not a browser default or jquery event no
[00:50:12] <Cork> haizum: jquery-mobile?
[00:50:18] <haizum> no
[00:50:25] <Cork> then no source event
[00:50:31] <haizum> hm well i thought that's how you used it
[00:50:35] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: have you gone through the validator?
[00:50:40] <haizum> examples at https://github.com/protonet/jquery.inview/blob/master/README.textile
[00:50:47] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: i`ve just add <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
[00:50:58] <haizum> show using .live("inview", function() {
[00:51:12] <Cork> haizum: uhh. thats would be a yes to my first question
[00:51:23] <Cork> haizum: so your using a plugin to generate the event
[00:51:57] <haizum> Cork: ?
[00:52:35] <Cork> haizum: and that plugin generates events on every element thats is visible
[00:52:45] <Cork> it doesn't just trigger when it gets in view
[00:52:49] <crem> Is there a way to access contents() of an iframe which is not in DOM tree yet? $('<iframe>').contents() doesn't work.
[00:53:34] <haizum> Cork: what do you mean by "plugin"
[00:53:36] <Cork> crem: no
[00:53:44] <crem> What I want to do is to modify contents of iframe before showing to user. Other ideas are welcome too.
[00:53:55] <Cork> haizum: you need to add that jquery plugin to your page
[00:54:01] <Cork> haizum: as in; its not part of jquery
[00:54:07] <haizum> Cork: inview? i have.
[00:54:14] <mindis|wurk> you could just keep the iframe hidden until it is loaded and then you can modify it and show it
[00:54:49] <haizum> like i said, its working, but its running into a loop and triggering the function for the entire page x number of times, x being the number of elements in view
[00:54:50] <Cork> crem: iframes is async so they are quite tricky to work with
[00:54:52] <crem> mindis|wurk, bad thing that if I do that iframe starts to load images from wrong location before I fix links.
[00:55:13] <haizum> i want it to just trigger once for all the elements in view, then stop
[00:55:49] <haizum> i.e. if they've already been triggered, then don't trigger them again
[00:55:55] <haizum> no need to apply styles more than once
[00:56:10] <crem> I just want to add <base> tag so all relative links work. If I put contents to iframe and then add, images are not loaded.
[00:56:46] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: validation doesn`t matter in that case. i don`t think that .find() will returns what i want if i`ll pass validation. by the way what is to validate in than 5-rows-html-code?
[00:57:07] <crem> If I do $(myHtml) it strips all headers.
[00:57:16] <crem> I mean all contents of <head>
[00:57:20] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: validation really REALLY matters
[00:57:33] <Cork> cause else you don't know how the dom tree will look like
[00:58:02] <Cork> and you get all kinds of wierd errors (like the one your seeing)
[00:59:00] <bugsy[afk]> Cork: ok. i`ll try
[00:59:33] <Cork> bugsy[afk]: not saying that will fix it, but its not even worth trying until thats fixed
[01:03:21] <bugsy_> Cork: i`ve just install validator plugin to firebug
[01:03:29] <Cork> uh...
[01:03:32] <Cork> no
[01:03:39] <Cork> run your site through w3cs validator
[01:03:47] <Cork> ?g w3c validator
[01:03:48] <bot-t> Cork, The W3C Markup Validation Service - http://validator.w3.org/
[01:04:36] <bugsy_> Cork: my site is local )
[01:04:47] <Cork> so pb the generated html
[01:04:51] <Cork> uh sorry
[01:05:00] <Cork> copy paste it into validator.w3c.org
[01:05:02] <bugsy_> ok i`ll upload it somewhere to hosting
[01:05:08] <Cork> no need
[01:05:22] <Cork> http://validator.w3.org/#validate-by-input
[01:05:35] <bugsy_> oh! good
[01:05:49] <Cork> but it needs to be the generated html
[01:05:51] <Cork> not the php
[01:08:22] <bugsy_> Cork: validator shows only unknown attr 'offset'
[01:08:49] <bugsy_> but it`s not problem
[01:09:00] <Cork> well it is, but its up to you
[01:09:19] <bugsy_> jQuery can get this attr
[01:09:23] <bugsy_> it`s ok
[01:09:30] <Cork> btw you did paste a generated page right?
[01:09:37] <bugsy_> yep
[01:09:37] <Cork> and not the same as the one you used in fiddle?
[01:09:54] <Cork> (as thats completly pointless for validating)
[01:10:41] <bugsy_> in fiddle no doctype
[01:11:01] <Cork> uh... so you sent it with php code in it? -_-'
[01:11:08] * Cork gives up
[01:12:41] <bugsy_> i`ve validate html with doctype without php
[01:13:13] <bugsy_> Cork: don`t give up!
[01:13:14] <claudio> Do you know of any issue about JSONP and HTTP redirects?
[01:13:29] <Cork> claudio: shouldn't be
[01:13:49] <Cork> its just a normal <script src="target"> tag
[01:14:12] <Cork> as long as the redirect generates the expected javascript it should work fine
[01:14:35] <claudio> Cork, still... if you have, say, 10 JSONP request one after the other, some of them got the "jsonp342432435 is not a function"
[01:14:44] <ssj> umm can anyone tell how can i set content type wen using $.post
[01:15:11] <Cork> claudio: then that sounds like the server response isn't what it should be
[01:15:34] <Cork> ssj: don't think you can, you prob need to use $.ajax
[01:16:19] <ssj> okie :(
[01:16:25] <ssj> gotta rewrite it now >:O
[01:16:38] <Cork> its not that different
[01:17:02] * Cork actually finds little point in .get and .post
[01:17:30] <claudio> Cork, *seems* like jquery removes the callback "too soon", like it was fauled by the http 302 (it's not a jquery issue, I know)
[01:17:39] <bugsy_> Cork: btw without .find() script it`s working, but it appends ALL response html (but i need only one selector). it`s a problem with find()!!!
[01:17:44] * claudio really puzzled
[01:18:03] <Cork> claudio: 302 shouldn't trigger a load event
[01:18:06] <Cork> claudio: what browser?
[01:18:15] <claudio> Corey, Chrome and Firefox
[01:18:35] <claudio> I'm still investingating but I think I have the minumum case already
[01:18:56] <Larholm> bugsy_, paste the generated output and your find() code
[01:19:02] <claudio> sorry, Cork ^
[01:19:13] <Cork> claudio: can't say i've seen anything like that
[01:19:32] <bugsy_> Larholm: paste to what?
[01:19:39] <Cork> claudio: redirect should be follwed by the browser before it tells js that the loads complete
[01:19:48] <claudio> yeah, also the "many parallel JSONP on redirects" are not so common :)
[01:20:00] <claudio> Corey, indeed.
[01:20:02] <Larholm> bugsy_, try http://jsfiddle.net/ or http://pastebin.com/
[01:20:13] <claudio> Cork, stupid xchat
[01:20:21] <Cagelin> hi guys! can someone tell me the case-insensitive version of inArray ?
[01:20:29] <Cork> claudio: as long as the browser loses it self on what dom element your working on, that shouldn't matter
[01:21:00] <Cork> Cagelin: there isn't one
[01:21:10] <Cagelin> k thx
[01:21:45] <bugsy_> Larholm: http://i.imgur.com/ZX3vF.png look to bottom-right window. i was trying to $(data).find('#cont'), but find() returns 'object Window'
[01:22:03] <DarsVaeda> Hi, on a page I have editable field and I want to save them with the enter button instead of generating a new line and strg+enter for the new line, is there a best practice?
[01:22:34] <Flo0815> DarsVaeda: capture the key-events
[01:22:45] <hurry> hi, how can i take h1 in this example by jquery? http://pastebin.com/w3VP0Ti3 something like find .....
[01:22:50] <Larholm> bugsy_, maybe you just want http://api.jquery.com/load/
[01:23:00] <Larholm> bugsy_, your problem is that you're trying to parse an entire HTML document
[01:23:23] <Cork> hurry: take it?
[01:23:23] <bugsy_> Larholm: but load() not sending POST (it`s a bug)
[01:23:37] <Cork> bugsy_: no its not
[01:23:52] <bugsy_> Cork: but WHY?
[01:23:59] <hurry> because i have to change h1 with another selector after change dropDownMenu
[01:24:25] <Cork> hurry: you want to replace the text you mean?
[01:24:53] <Cork> bugsy_: its imposible to say until you actually produce enough or us to go through what happens
[01:24:57] <hurry> yes, now i replace, but i want "take" the selector in dinamicaly mode
[01:25:18] <Cork> hurry: i have no clue what you mean by take...
[01:25:31] <gnarf> Cagelin: jQuery.inArrayInsensitive = function( value, array ) { return jQuery.inArray( (value+"").toLowerCase(), jQuery.map( array, function( v ) { return (v + "").toLowerCase(); }) ); };
[01:26:06] <bugsy_> Larholm: i trying to parce HTML because it is in examples http://i.imgur.com/Z7Wre.png ( http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ )
[01:26:38] <hurry> Cork this is my entire script after dropDownMenu http://pastebin.com/FciQvfr9, now selettore is param, but i want that selettore is retrive in mode dinamically ( sorry for my english)
[01:27:05] <bugsy_> Cork: how can i explain "what happens" else?
[01:27:23] <gnarf> ?js jQuery.inArrayInsensitive = function( value, array ) { return jQuery.inArray( (value+"").toLowerCase(), jQuery.map( array, function( v ) { return (v + "").toLowerCase(); }) ); }; jQuery.inArrayInsensitive( "TEST", ["omg", "teSt"] )
[01:27:39] <Cork> bugsy_: whats needed is the html and the script used, not images, not php, and not fragments
[01:27:56] * gnarf frowns - no bot-t
[01:28:22] <Eviltwin> Wow, is bugsy_ still going?
[01:28:29] <bugsy_> Cork: it`s NOT fragment! it`s whole script for training
[01:28:49] <bugsy_> Eviltwin: what you mean?
[01:28:54] <gnarf> Eviltwin: that isn't the wow factor - Cork still trying is ;)
[01:29:12] <bugsy_> gnarf: that`s right
[01:29:50] <Trisox> bugsy_: add some console.log 's
[01:29:54] <Trisox> so you can test output..
[01:30:19] <Trisox> loging is knowing
[01:30:33] <bugsy_> Trisox: this thing i don`t leaned
[01:30:56] <bugsy_> Trisox: what i must do?
[01:33:07] <Trisox> console.log(content)? with firebug
[01:33:11] <alaing> Hi can someone help me build a url for my post request I'm using $.ajax() and here is my data: option http://pastebin.com/dwzF8WsE
[01:33:26] <Trisox> http://getfirebug.com/logging
[01:33:28] <Trisox> there
[01:34:04] <Trisox> http://michaelsync.net/2007/09/09/firebug-tutorial-logging-profiling-and-commandline-part-i
[01:34:17] <bugsy_> ok. thanx
[01:34:19] <alaing> Trisox: that last link is excellant
[01:35:05] <Cork> alaing: $.ajax('url', { data:data, type: 'get' }); should do that
[01:36:01] <alaing> Cork: I'm using POST not get and that data part is inside my $.ajax() call
[01:36:19] <Cork> uh.. you want get varialbes in your post call?
[01:36:58] <alaing> yes so its in that format
[01:37:13] <Cork> ?.params
[01:37:18] <Cork> gah
[01:37:29] <Cork> alaing: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[01:37:30] <alaing> can i use .params in data?
[01:37:36] <Cork> no
[01:37:39] <Cork> in the url
[01:37:49] <Cork> post uses post variables for data
[01:38:11] <Cork> if you want get variables you need to concat them to the url
[01:38:20] <Cork> (if you really need to do a post call)
[01:40:26] <alaing> I've used another $.ajax() call but i only had one p_arg_name and p_arg_name. note only one value p_arg_name not p_arg_names and it worked
[01:40:44] <alaing> now i need to pass in mulitp p_arg_name which the server needs as p_arg_names
[01:41:21] <Trisox> Cork you got patience like an angel
[01:41:26] <bugsy_> Trisox: ok. i`ve just logging my script. it`s ok. POST - sends. HTML response - returns. but .find() still returns objectWindow
[01:42:01] <Trisox> so what do you need to do?
[01:42:12] <bugsy_> well...
[01:43:22] <Cork> alaing: the standard is that key: array becomes key[]=&key[]=
[01:43:40] <Cork> alaing: (standard as in what the servers normally expect)
[01:43:49] <Cork> alaing: and thats what jquery generates
[01:45:57] <bugsy_> Trisox: by button click (jQuery) .post() an attribute to .php-script (itself) and .find() in html response content of some <div id="cont"> then append() to page this content.
[01:46:21] <alaing> Cork: Thats Exactly how I see the data in Firebug.
[01:46:45] <Cork> alaing: see what data?
[01:46:45] <alaing> Cork: I was looking at param and wondered if I should change the "traditional" setting
[01:47:05] <alaing> the POST request that is being set to the server
[01:48:04] <Cork> alaing: i don't follow, you seeing exactly what i explained or what?
[01:49:34] <alaing> i see p_arg_names[]=
[01:50:00] <Cork> alaing: if you need to remove the [] you need to generate the string your self
[01:50:25] <Cork> alaing: a better option would be to make your server accept the standard way of expressing arrays in params
[01:50:27] <alaing> I'm trying to get rid of ORACLE Application Express method of doing AJAX calls
[01:50:50] <alaing> I wish I could
[01:50:53] <Cork> oh, its you with the oracle junk server >_<
[01:51:05] <alaing> lol
[01:51:10] <alaing> yip thats me...
[01:51:16] <Cork> well then ya, you need to concat your params to geather your self
[01:51:28] <Cork> best is prob to generate your own little function
[01:51:43] <alaing> so get rid of data setting inside the $.ajax()?
[01:51:56] <alaing> Yes thats what I'm trying to do
[01:52:28] <alaing> I got it to work where p_arg_name is a single key/value pair
[01:52:52] <alaing> but so soon as there is more the server needs p_arg_names and p_arg_values
[01:53:28] <Cork> alaing: you could try someting like $.params(data).replace('[]=', '=')
[01:55:34] <bugsy_> Cork: one question
[01:56:02] <bugsy_> Cork: see that LAST example? http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[01:56:59] <bugsy_> Cork: see that block contains comment "Send the data using post and put the results in a div"?
[01:57:28] <alaing> Cork Sounds sensible, where should I place that line?
[01:57:44] <bugsy_> Cork: i do the same thing and .find() returns objectWindow
[01:58:05] <Cork> alaing: $.ajax('url/to/server/script?' + $.params(data).replace('[]=', '='))
[01:58:11] <Kingsy> ok guys, I really need some help.. I started off with an issue of some variables not appearing as I thought they would so I wanted to debug them so I tried console.log(someVar); nothing displayed in the console.. console.log("SOMETHING"); nothing displays.. alert("Something"); displays.. wtf ???
[01:58:27] <Cork> alaing: i'm not completly sure if $.params creates the ? character or not, you might need to add that your self
[01:58:39] <Cork> alaing
[01:58:43] <Cork> on other hand
[01:58:48] <alaing> Ok thanks I'll give that a go
[01:58:49] <Cork> that should work in data too :)
[01:58:49] <Eviltwin> bugsy_: That last example is basically doing what .load() does
[01:58:52] <Cork> even nicer :D
[01:59:02] <alaing> where in data?
[01:59:12] <Cork> alaing: $.ajax(url, { data: $.params(data).replace('[]=', '=') })
[01:59:18] <bugsy_> Eviltwin: yep, but with POST
[01:59:27] <Cork> alaing: if you give data a string jquery doesn't do anything with it
[01:59:48] <bugsy_> Eviltwin: .load() somehow not send POST-data
[01:59:53] <alaing> But I'm passing other values as well
[02:00:18] <Cork> alaing: you should do that with the entire object you gave to data before
[02:00:22] <durre> I make an ajax request which returns a list of products in JSON. now I want to render these products in my markup. I know of several ways of doing this but I wonder if there's a "best practice"?
[02:00:26] <alaing> actually I could build data outside of my $.ajax
[02:00:39] <alaing> and then as you say juat pass i nthe string
[02:00:42] <Cork> alaing: na you can do $.params({}).replace too
[02:01:05] <bugsy_> Eviltwin: at first time i`m of coz trying to use .load()
[02:01:06] <alaing> Oh ok that makes sense and more logical
[02:01:24] <alaing> do i need to true processData off?
[02:01:30] <alaing> true=turn
[02:01:52] <bugsy_> Eviltwin: http://api.jquery.com/load/ last example not working by the way
[02:06:44] <bugsy_> Eviltwin: shi... exactly it`s working
[02:09:55] <gnarf> bugsy_: console.log( $ )
[02:11:21] <bugsy_> gnarf: wait a sec. i think my problem is solved. now i trying to find an error in my first code
[02:18:29] <AdvoWork> Is there a way to set a field, like $('#field').val("test") but for that field that is within a certain span id?
[02:19:51] <quicksilver> yes of course.
[02:20:04] <quicksilver> $('#span_id input').val("test")
[02:20:12] <quicksilver> will work if ti's the only onput element inside #span_id
[02:21:26] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, theres loads within the span, can i specific a specifc one?
[02:21:30] <quicksilver> yes.
[02:21:40] <quicksilver> by any of the many, many ways that jquery selectors have
[02:21:58] <quicksilver> as you surely know, you can select things by class, by id, by position, by parent, by attribute....
[02:22:08] <granden> ah
[02:22:10] <granden> woops
[02:22:57] <granden> does jQuery have some class/functions like php's DateTime and DateInterval?
[02:23:06] <_ikke_> How comes when I print the val() of a checkbox in the change event of that checkbox, I always get 'on'
[02:23:34] <Cork> _ikke_ cause it shows the value of the checkbox
[02:23:45] <hurry> Cork i find something with children().get(0).tagName
[02:23:48] <Cork> _ikke_: you want prop('checked')
[02:23:58] <hurry> for my problem
[02:24:35] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, $('#test #a').val("testa"); seems to work, or is that just by luck its picking the correct #a ?
[02:24:39] <_ikke_> Cork: Ok
[02:24:54] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: are you telling me you have two inputs with the same ID in your document.
[02:24:58] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: ?
[02:25:13] <quicksilver> granden: not jquery, not. See the javascript docs. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[02:25:54] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, i've basically got a repeated section, so its a form, thats the same in some aspects but different, so i'm hide() ing one, and show() ing another
[02:26:07] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: answer my question.
[02:26:14] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: Do you have two inputs with the same ID?
[02:26:30] <blaza> any experiences about the boilerplate html5 template? anyone?
[02:26:31] <Cork> hurry: i still don't have a clue what your trying to do
[02:27:44] <granden> quicksilver: Is it possible to add 30 days to a Date-variable to get that date?
[02:27:54] <granden> and then check if it is a sunday or saturady.
[02:27:56] <_ikke_> AdvoWork: No two elements should have the same id
[02:28:12] <_ikke_> AdvoWork: under no circomstance
[02:28:27] <_ikke_> s/circomstance/circumstance
[02:36:25] <haizum> i'm trying to use .live('inview', function() { to set some styles, and it's working OK except that i only want them to be applied once. similar to the .one() function, where the handler is executed only once per element. possible?
[02:39:14] <ablomen> haizum, what version of jquery are you using?
[02:40:07] <Cagelin> haizum, I think you could use a combination of the .each() method and live
[02:40:26] <Cagelin> e.g.: $('.inview').each(function(e,el){ $(el).live(...) });
[02:41:02] <bugsy_> Cork, gnarf, Eviltwin: it was problem with a browser cache. btw my problem solved with .load() :)
[02:41:17] <bugsy_> thanx guyz
[02:41:22] <haizum> Cagelin: hmm i don't really follow
[02:41:28] <blaza> so the first() isn't what you are looking for?
[02:41:44] <ablomen> Cagelin, that defeats the whole purpose of live.. anyway haizum as of 1.7 you can use .one like .on, so you can do $(".parentEl").one("click", ".targetEl", function ( ) { });
[02:42:13] <Cagelin> ah good point ablomen, didn't think of it that way :x
[02:44:53] <ablomen> haizum, also, as of 1.7 you can forget about .bind, .live, .delegate etc and just use .on instead
[02:45:09] <haizum> wow im gonna upgrade from 1.4.4 then
[02:45:21] <haizum> i wish i knew that earlier, been trying to get this to work all day :/
[02:57:39] <haizum> ablomen: i just upgraded to jquery 1.7.2 and one isn't working like you said
[02:57:54] <haizum> that is, the one() function
[02:58:06] <ablomen> what do you have now?
[02:58:45] <haizum> same problem, elements on next page loaded by infinite scroll aren't being handled
[02:59:06] <ablomen> i mean code wise
[02:59:29] <haizum> same as before, except i replaced .live with .one
[02:59:33] <haizum> $(".attachment-portfoliosmall").one("inview",
[02:59:56] <haizum> shouldn't have to specify a selector
[03:00:10] <haizum> "If the selector is null or omitted, the event is always triggered when it reaches the selected element."
[03:00:57] <ablomen> haizum, yes but you want to delegate the events to a parent element, so it works like live instead of bind
[03:00:57] <haizum> works great on the elements on the first page
[03:01:00] <haizum> but not the next one
[03:02:10] <ablomen> $("body").one("inview", ".attachment-portfoliosmall", function ( ) { }) should work fine, as long as that custom event is actually triggered
[03:02:15] <Xotix> http://alokmenghrajani.github.com/tron/ :) u always should code like that ^^
[03:02:24] <haizum> on() doesn't even work
[03:03:57] <jaffipaffi> Hi, when performing a .post with function(data) parameter, and I alert that data, it just returns [object Document]
[03:03:59] <jaffipaffi> Is that correct?
[03:04:31] <Kapil> Issue with draggable & droppable. Not getting drop position. Any help pls. Code HTML-http://pastebin.com/vPW318J1  JS-http://pastebin.com/ZuCLc4ma  CSS-http://pastebin.com/6EaiwSEQ
[03:05:28] <haizum> ablomen: that only loads the very first image
[03:05:42] <haizum> going backwards now :)
[03:10:41] <ablomen> haizum, do you have your code online somewhere?
[03:10:47] <haizum> yup
[03:11:54] <haizum> http://pastebin.com/Jmb4skRx
[03:11:58] <haizum> that's the original code from my theme
[03:12:16] <haizum> im just changing the first line of code
[03:16:24] <Robbington> Hi, does any one know of a bug wioth ie8  and ie7 with append and prepend?
[03:17:12] <Robbington> my code works in all browser except those and it picks up the hover event that starts it, it just doesnt append anything
[03:20:58] <haizum> ablomen: any clue?
[03:21:55] <ablomen> haizum, i have no idea, you are using some kind of custom event, don't have enough info to go on with just those few lines
[03:22:32] <haizum> https://github.com/protonet/jquery.inview/blob/master/README.textile
[03:22:37] <haizum> there's the info for the inview plugin
[03:22:41] <haizum> it's pretty straightforward
[03:23:03] <haizum> the custom event is triggered when the elements are within the viewport
[03:23:19] <haizum> hence, "inview"
[03:24:08] <ablomen> yeah i get that, i just have no idea if it works with 1.7 and fully supports .on, and i don't have time to make a demo to try it
[03:24:28] <DarsVaeda> is there a list what jquery version is compatible with which jquery-ui version?
[03:30:58] <Robbington> Hi, does any one know of a bug wioth ie8  and ie7 with append and prepend?
[03:31:13] <Robbington>  my code works in all browser except those and it picks up the hover event that starts it, it just doesnt append anything

[03:51:51] <abc__> can you please make me understand how things are happening

[03:59:38] <bittyx-work> hi all. i have a function that does some animations on my page. is there an easy way to set up a callback that gets called exactly at the moment when the last animation stops?
[03:59:46] <bittyx-work> (stops == finishes)
[04:03:33] <Xotix> does someone know tincymce inhere?
[04:03:55] <xec> bittyx-work: sounds like you could use deferreds http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/02/merging-jquery-deferreds-and-animate
[04:05:13] <kap0w> Xotix: Only by hate of missing documentation and inconsitencies   :)
[04:05:38] <xec> ?anyone @ Xotix
[04:05:38] <bot-t> Xotix, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[04:06:01] <Kapil> Issue with draggable & droppable. Not getting drop position. Any help pls. Code HTML-http://pastebin.com/vPW318J1 JS-http://pastebin.com/ZuCLc4ma CSS-http://pastebin.com/6EaiwSEQ
[04:07:18] <quicksilver> bittyx-work: yes, that is issue because it is a basic feature of jQuery animations. They all take a callback parameter.
[04:07:25] <quicksilver> "that is easy" I mean.
[04:07:33] <bittyx-work> xec: i'll check that out, thanks.
[04:08:05] <bittyx-work> quicksilver: as i've said, i'm doing a bunch of animations at once - i want to run a function when *all of them* finish
[04:08:28] <quicksilver> bittyx-work: a bunch in parallel?
[04:08:39] <bittyx-work> quicksilver: yes.
[04:08:41] <quicksilver> I see :)
[04:08:47] <quicksilver> I thought you meant a chain of animations.
[04:09:03] <bittyx-work> nope :)
[04:09:29] <bittyx-work> sorry i wasn't clear in the first place, i realize that just now
[04:09:37] <quicksilver> the post xec gave does show you a way
[04:09:50] <quicksilver> basically set up a counter and increment it for each enimation and decrement it in their callbacks
[04:09:56] <quicksilver> the post just shows a "clever" way to do that with Deferre.d
[04:10:22] <Xotix> How can i get all available instances of tinyMCE?
[04:13:06] <mushin> var self = $(this), imgWidth, imgHeight;  self.css({width: "auto", height: "auto"}); imgWidth = this.width || $(e.target).width();imgHeight = this.height || $(e.target).height(); imgRatio = imgWidth / imgHeight; --- i need to subtract 390px from imgWidth. can someone please help me with this?
[04:13:37] <xec> mushin: what is "this" ?
[04:14:09] <mushin> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/qKmrP/3/
[04:14:54] <mushin> its a script called backstrectch. I need it to calculate the width as 390px less
[04:15:51] <xec> do you have the width?
[04:16:30] <mushin> imgWidth is taken from the current browser width
[04:16:59] <xec> mushin: ok, why don't you just do imgWidth = imgWidth - 390;
[04:17:27] <xec> or imgWidth -= 390;
[04:17:41] <mushin> cool ill give it a try :)
[04:18:20] <xec> after it's set ofcourse
[04:19:35] <mikkelb> I'm working on this app to neatly present some HTML page designs I did: http://home.no/reddvinylene/test2/ - http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/21/ - how do I wrap the loaded HTMLs inside an iframe so they will display correctly?
[04:19:39] <mikkelb> I tried $(this).load(url); => $(this).wrap(load(url)); to no avail..
[04:20:59] <bittyx-work> quicksilver: thanks for the tip,i figured out to do the same exact thing on my own, just thought there might be a "better" way than doing it manually - i assume that's what deferreds are for, but i haven't yet gotten around to learning about them :P
[04:27:57] <Misiur> mikkelb: I'm back
[04:30:10] <Misiur> $(this).append($('<iframe></iframe>').load(url));
[04:31:35] <claudio> Misiur, I'd be very surprised if that like worked
[04:31:50] <claudio> but hey, jQuery is allmighty! ;)
[04:33:16] <Misiur> claudio: http://jsfiddle.net/aTzka/ not what expected, but still
[04:35:43] <claudio> Misiur, $('#pancake').append($('<iframe></iframe>').attr("src", url)) might be a better way
[04:36:10] <claudio> Misiur, to load the content of the iframe you don't need any "ajax" thing. Just use the src attribute
[04:36:12] <Misiur> Yup, I hope he did it this way, that was raw draft.
[04:37:15] <mikkelb> hey!
[04:37:33] <mikkelb> sorry was outside eating in the sun
[04:37:45] <mikkelb> awesome move guys thank y'all so much!
[04:38:14] <mikkelb> xec: you exited pretty quickly yesterday i didnt get a chance to say good bye ;)
[04:38:58] <xec> good bye!
[04:39:02] <xec> er. hi!
[04:39:24] <mikkelb> hehe
[04:43:04] <mikkelb> Misiur, claudio, how am I doing? http://home.no/reddvinylene/test2/
[04:44:03] <Misiur> mikkelb: Looks good, just get rid of '$(document).ready(function() {' because you already have it wrapped
[04:44:56] <xec> Misiur: (function($){ != $(function(){
[04:45:07] <mikkelb> Misiur: somehow that breaks it though
[04:45:41] <mikkelb> ah, just a slip of the eye there i guess no worries mate
[04:45:44] <xec> mikkelb: you can do jQuery(function($){ /*stuff on ready */ });
[04:46:12] <mikkelb> xec: yeah that looks a lot better
[04:46:12] <Misiur> xec: Oh. Lack of sleep is the source of all these little demons
[04:46:15] <xec> rather than first an iife and then a docready
[04:47:02] <poppiez> hi, I want to transform the following to a nested <ul> list: http://pastie.org/private/yapqczyx5f8iy6fknee22g. can anyone point in me in the right direction? I need to do a recursive func
[04:47:40] <poppiez> but I'm not entirely sure on the best way to open/close the tags and avoid as much as code as possible
[04:49:10] <xec> poppiez: what have you tried so far?
[04:49:20] <mikkelb> At http://home.no/reddvinylene/test2/ - how do I move the explanatory text from #viewport li into #navigation #explanation?
[04:50:44] <Ahrengot> Hey guys. Consider the following fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Ahrengot/NFKY7/
[04:51:36] <Ahrengot> line 2. speed || 350 converts 0 to 350 because 0 is a falsy value, but i know there's a way to do this with a one-liner, i just forgot. Any help would be much appreciated :)
[04:52:20] <Misiur> Ahrengot: http://jsfiddle.net/NFKY7/1/
[04:52:28] <Misiur> you can check for int instead for undefined
[04:52:35] <Misiur> just swap returns then
[04:53:05] <poppiez> xec: I've tried a recursive function that goes through all the arrays but I'm not sure on how to build the HTML. something like this: http://pastie.org/private/ots16vaiysby9cg4uuukzw
[04:54:15] <Ahrengot> Awesome, thanks. I tried a ternary but my stupid brain came up with this "isNaN(speed) ? 350 : speed" which of course didn't work :D
[04:54:17] <Ahrengot> thanks.
[04:56:32] <poppiez> xec: this works: http://pastie.org/private/p5ojy4rxsozlptvznws6ow
[04:56:38] <poppiez> how do you like that solution?
[04:57:18] <xec> poppiez: looks good, at a glance
[04:57:19] <xec> ;D
[04:57:37] <poppiez> :(
[04:57:38] <poppiez> hehe
[04:58:09] <Misiur> Hm, overwriting html in local scope - interesting approach
[04:58:20] <xec> the two html vars looks confusing though
[04:59:06] <poppiez> Misiur: it won't be overwritten but I agree the naming is confusing. will change that
[05:03:44] <AbstractAce> how can i use jquery to load a new page
[05:03:47] <AbstractAce> like send the user to a new page
[05:03:49] <AbstractAce> like href does
[05:04:08] <poppiez> window.location.href = '/';
[05:04:11] <poppiez> nothing to do with jquery
[05:04:25] <AbstractAce> ok
[05:04:28] <AbstractAce> raw js?
[05:04:35] <EdwardIII> hey chaps i'm working on wrapping a span around the end of every word in every heading tag, but it's putting the first word at the end of the list currently for some reason: http://jsfiddle.net/QUUtW/2/
[05:04:36] <Kuba> hey
[05:04:38] <poppiez> AbstractAce: yes
[05:05:29] <Kuba> Can I do that?  var map = {"a": "b", "c": "d"}; $.each(map, function(v,k) { map[k] = "asd" + v})
[05:07:00] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/25/ (app to neatly present some HTML page designs I did) - does anybody know why the code to display "N of N pages" isn't working?
[05:07:25] <superdmp> I'm using fancyBox for a lightbox: http://fancybox.net
[05:07:52] <superdmp> one thing I don't like about it is that it uses the rel attribute on anchors to associate items with each other to make a gallery
[05:08:05] <superdmp> <a rel="group1" …… >
[05:08:27] <superdmp> I would like to use a custom data-fancybox-group attribute instead
[05:09:01] <superdmp> this is how it's used: http://fancybox.net/howto - is it likely to be easy to achieve that somehow?
[05:13:14] <Kuba> Ups, sorry, I meant var map = {"a": "b", "c": "d"}; $.each(map, function(k,v) { map[k] = "asd" + v}) is it safe to run this? is there a better way to do that? :)
[05:17:12] <imc> hello
[05:20:54] <jacof> HI. I need to do an ajax GET, and when its over, perform a series of other calls, in order. I want to use a deferred object but I'm having trouble understanding how should my code be structured. Isn't $.ajax itself already a deferred object?
[05:21:06] <gener1c> is there a way to change a binded .post request's success handler?
[05:21:18] <gener1c> without rewriting the whole shtick
[05:25:07] <Evelynn> Hey, i get table of fields from servlet trough ajax. then i try to apply datepicker to them, but it doesn't seem to work: part of my code is : $.get('servletAjax', { function(data) { $('input[id*="addPicker"]').each(function() { $(this).datepicker(); }); any info why?
[05:26:04] <Chris_____> Hey, is this the help channel for jquery?
[05:26:37] <EdwardIII> this solution seems to peel off words too: http://jsfiddle.net/QUUtW/3/
[05:26:38] <quicksilver> jacof: why not ust use the ajax command's callback?
[05:26:39] <quicksilver> Chris_____: yes.
[05:26:44] <sigurding> anyone here using sammy.js?
[05:27:03] <quicksilver> Evelynn: { function(data)  looks very odd.
[05:27:03] <Chris_____> Good, because I've been googling for about 2 hours on this one problem I have...
[05:27:10] <jacof> quicksilver basically because I'm also trying to learn about deferred objects
[05:27:13] <EdwardIII> is this to do with my misunderstanding of how jquery plugins work or what?
[05:27:41] <EdwardIII> my jqueryfoo is weak today
[05:28:31] <Chris_____> I'm trying to use jQuery.parseJSON, but it keeps giving me the error "unexpected character", but doesn't point to where it might be wrong... is there any way to find out, because the string I try to parse has about 1200 entries?
[05:28:54] <quicksilver> EdwardIII: your code is now almost correct.
[05:29:23] <quicksilver> EdwardIII: it's just you've written "wrapEnd" in a way which gets confused if it's called on more than one element.
[05:29:34] <EdwardIII> ah right, it is getting called on lots of elements
[05:29:40] <quicksilver> EdwardIII: it does everything based on the first element in the selector
[05:29:49] <quicksilver> (but applies it to both of them, which is why they end up the same()
[05:29:58] <gener1c> if i binded a post request to a submit is there a way to access the returned info upon invocation without using the success func?
[05:30:07] <quicksilver> EdwardIII: you probably want to wrap most of your code in this.each(...)
[05:30:12] <quicksilver> EdwardIII: so it runs separately on each.
[05:30:20] <Evelynn> quicksilver: isn't that standard way of making ajax get call? $.get('ajax/test.html', function(data) { });
[05:30:54] <quicksilver> Evelynn: sure, but that's not what you wrote.
[05:31:20] <EdwardIII> ahhh, i see
[05:31:23] <EdwardIII> thanks quicksilver - works now: http://jsfiddle.net/QUUtW/4/
[05:32:12] <VernonK> Chris____: Could be an issue with the formatting of your JSON file.  The JSON has to be well formed (no single quotes, properties must have double quotes, etc)
[05:32:22] <quicksilver> EdwardIII: good. Might as well use "this.each" rather than "$(this).each"
[05:32:30] <quicksilver> EdwardIII: this is already a jQuery object.
[05:33:01] <VernonK> Chris____: Have you ran the JSON file through JSONLint?  http://jsonlint.com/
[05:33:42] <EdwardIII> quicksilver: excellent, thanks again
[05:34:30] <quicksilver> EdwardIII: example of a flaw in the idea of splitting HTML on spaces : http://jsfiddle.net/QUUtW/5/
[05:34:39] <quicksilver> EdwardIII: it may be that you don't care, for your purposes, which is fine ;)
[05:35:52] <Evelynn> quicksilver: ok, let me re-phrase my question: i'm trying to apply datepicker input fields in table, that i get from servlet and then i add to page. inside get. success function, after html is set, i try to bind them: $('input[id*="addPicker"]').each(function() { $(this).datepicker(); } but it doesnt seem to work on them. this code works on page load
[05:36:26] <Chris_____> VernonK: Thanks mate, that helps a lot with the debugging, now I have something to go on
[05:36:54] <VernonK> Chris____: Great. Glad to help.
[05:37:10] <quicksilver> Evelynn: that will add the datepicker to every input whose id contains "addPicker"
[05:37:29] <EdwardIII> quicksilver: hrm, good point! i think it's ok for my own purposes for now, but it's good to know
[05:37:34] <quicksilver> Evelynn: like id="happyaddPicker" or id="addPickerPocker"
[05:37:47] <quicksilver> Evelynn: if that's what you want, that's fine, and your problem is somewhere else.
[05:37:56] <EdwardIII> back to that old addage, html is always more complicated than you think - don't try and parse it with regex
[05:38:01] <quicksilver> right.
[05:38:05] <quicksilver> also jQuery is shit with text nodes
[05:38:09] <quicksilver> (sorry jquery :P )
[05:38:22] <Evelynn> quicksilver: yes, all those input fields have this id, that i retriewe with ajax, but it doesnt seem to work
[05:38:46] <quicksilver> Evelynn: they all have the same id? They all have the exact id "addPicker" ?
[05:40:34] <Evelynn> quicksilver: no, their full id is "text<table_row>Picker"
[05:41:30] <quicksilver> Evelynn: hopefully text<table_row>addPicker ?
[05:41:42] <quicksilver> Evelynn: well then the code your showed is fine. Your problem must be somewhere else.
[05:42:00] <Evelynn> quicksilver: ye i'm just making names up for reference
[05:42:53] <Evelynn> quicksilver: on static page this works, if i get same this form axay, it seems it cannot bind them, like they don't exist
[05:42:59] <Evelynn> from*
[05:44:01] <quicksilver> Evelynn: maybe you're trying to do it before they're added to the dom?
[05:44:08] <quicksilver> maybe there were already things in the DOM with those IDs
[05:44:22] <quicksilver> if you know this works in a static page
[05:44:26] <gener1c> http://jsfiddle.net/5sNbh/ how do i do that?
[05:44:28] <quicksilver> there isn't much point showing me the code that works
[05:44:33] <quicksilver> since we can all agree that it works
[05:44:39] <quicksilver> you need to show the code that *doesn't* work.
[05:44:50] <Evelynn> yes that probably what dosn't work, i read somethig about .live(
[05:45:15] <gener1c> Evelynn: was that pointed at me?
[05:45:17] <quicksilver> .live isn't relevant to datepickers.
[05:45:23] <quicksilver> .live is relevant to event handlers
[05:45:37] <quicksilver> for datepickers you  need to set up the datepicker after the objects go into the DOM.
[05:47:27] <gener1c> i dont mind passing another callback even
[05:48:20] <brettster> hey guys
[05:48:25] <brettster> I really need some quick help
[05:48:28] <gener1c> hey
[05:48:40] <brettster> http://hhk.com.s142783.gridserver.com/index.php
[05:48:42] <gener1c> anyways how do i pass the data back
[05:48:53] <Evelynn> quicksilver: ok, on start (jsf) creates table with one row with input field in it. and if i run $('input[id*="addPicker"]').each(function() { $(this).datepicker(); }) code inside document ready it works. then we appy ajax call that changs that table with lets say 3 rows with inputs in them, and if i run same code on them, they do not get registered
[05:48:55] <brettster> for some reason - this is not working in IE 7, or 8
[05:49:16] <brettster> its the jcycle slider
[05:49:31] <Evelynn> gener1c: sorry not for you
[05:49:42] <quicksilver> Evelynn: well one possibility is that your ajax code is trying to re-use IDs which already exist.
[05:50:00] <quicksilver> Evelynn: another possibility is that the IDs in the ajax inserted elements are not what you think they are
[05:50:25] <Evelynn> quicksilver: yes that's probably the case, first wor on that gets retrieved should have same id than on "static" page
[05:50:44] <Evelynn> row*
[05:51:26] <quicksilver> Evelynn: well you can't do that.
[05:51:32] <quicksilver> Evelynn: IDs must be unique.
[05:51:37] <quicksilver> Evelynn: but why use ids for this at all?
[05:51:52] <quicksilver> Evelynn: why not just give everything which is to be made a datepicker, some class
[05:52:02] <quicksilver> class="addPicker" would have no such problem.
[05:52:20] <quicksilver> $('.addPicker').datepicker(); // job done
[05:54:13] <Evelynn> alright i'll try that, so what would $('input[id*="textZeljeniRokDobave"]') look like in this case?
[05:54:27] <VernonK> brettster: That console.log in there is going to kill you since IE7 or 8 don't support console natively
[05:54:57] <brettster> but that's not what's messing up jcycle
[05:56:28] <quicksilver> Evelynn: just $('.addPicker')
[05:59:00] <brettster> vernonK any ideas?
[05:59:31] <VernonK> brettster: That's strange because when I remove those two console.logs and map that scripts.js through Charles Proxy to my local version I pulled down (without them) the banner images cycle.
[05:59:34] <Evelynn> quicksilver: thanks, that worked :)
[06:00:02] <brettster> hmm
[06:00:05] <brettster> in ie 7, 8 ?
[06:00:07] <brettster> or ie 9?
[06:00:34] <VernonK> IE7 & 8
[06:00:52] <brettster> hmm
[06:01:01] <brettster> i just removed the console.log
[06:01:04] <brettster> and am testing in ie
[06:01:09] <brettster> and not seeing a difference.
[06:01:31] <VernonK> hmm
[06:01:57] <VernonK> I'll check again just to be sure I wasn't seeing something that wasn't actually there.
[06:03:00] <Chris_____> Wow, VernonK, now I even got that code to work... Thanks a bunch!
[06:03:17] <VernonK> Chris____: Nice!  Glad it helped.
[06:03:32] <quicksilver> jsonlint++
[06:04:01] <VernonK> brettster: Yeah, I'm looking in native IE7 and the cycle is working.  That is strange.
[06:05:00] <VernonK> brettster: Sorry, doesn't look like I'm going to be able to help.  Maybe someone else who can recreate can help you out.
[06:05:23] <brettster> awesome
[06:05:26] <brettster> was a refresh issuye
[06:05:30] <brettster> thank you vernonk
[06:05:56] <VernonK> brettster:  Haha... Hate those.  Have to love oldIE and it's wonderful caching.  ;)  Glad to help.
[06:07:52] <MacroMan> Hi. I have a function call that doean't work as expected. See here: http://pastebin.com/aGscMN6N
[06:08:27] <MacroMan> The function it calls works as expected, but my code I just pasted seems to call it twice and I don't understand why
[06:09:18] <VernonK> MacroMan: It's because you're calling it before you're binding to the click
[06:09:20] <rroelofs> MacroMan: you click event handler is incorrect.
[06:09:27] <timing> remove the ()
[06:09:31] <rroelofs> remove the parens() from the function call
[06:09:53] <rroelofs> I'm glad we have a consensus :-)
[06:09:55] <timing> it now puts the return value in the click() instead a reference to the function
[06:09:57] <MacroMan> Like this: .click(play1);
[06:10:02] <VernonK> Yep
[06:10:02] <timing> yes
[06:10:06] <VernonK> ;)
[06:10:10] <timing> I don't blame you btw
[06:10:11] <brettster> vernonK are you seeing the main nav a little too high up in ie7?
[06:10:14] <MacroMan> Thank you. I always get help here
[06:10:18] <timing> pretty weird if you ask me :-)
[06:10:23] <VernonK> brettster: Yeah, I did notice that.
[06:11:14] <VernonK> Thought maybe that was something you were still working with in the CSS
[06:14:32] <Adamantus> Hi
[06:14:48] <Adamantus>  On this page: http://www.autismworks.co.uk/ Can anyone see why console.log isn't working for general.js please?
[06:15:20] <Adamantus> It just says: $(function(){ console.log('test')' } but does not run.
[06:15:43] <Adamantus> *  console.log('test');
[06:16:32] <recentlydeceased> Howdy, I'm currently trying to decrement the ID of a bunch of divs with sequential IDs, based on the removal of one of those divs, shuffling those items that to to the right of the removed div, one to the left.  having trouble iterating over the elements, I can select the next() item,
[06:16:37] <recentlydeceased> any ideas?
[06:17:25] <MacroMan> recentlydeceased: use .each    http://api.jquery.com/each/
[06:18:01] <recentlydeceased> MacroMan, yeah, but how do I select only the divs I need?
[06:18:51] <MacroMan> recentlydeceased: Give all the divs that you want to select the same class and then do $('.className').each();
[06:19:02] <recentlydeceased> MacroMan, at the moment I can change the next div ID using $(this).parent().next("div").attr("id","divs-"+previousId)
[06:20:01] <recentlydeceased> MacroMan, cheers, I'll give it a whirl
[06:20:58] <DarsVaeda> hi, what templating engine is best used with jquery?
[06:21:30] <timing> I use the deprecated jquery.tmpl, still works sweet
[06:22:07] <DarsVaeda> saw that too but as it is discontinued...but maybe still better than resigs original templating thing you can find anywere
[06:22:09] <DarsVaeda> ?
[06:25:26] <fn> hi
[06:25:34] <Adamantus> Hi
[06:26:01] <crem> hi
[06:26:16] <MacroMan> DarsVaeda: Not sure if it works with jQuery,  but I use Smarty when I'm coding php.
[06:26:29] <fn> how is it possible to set a function to do something (left and right click) only one time (one left, one right, one left, one right) and not 2 times the same way?
[06:26:30] <DarsVaeda> yes I do too
[06:26:52] <DarsVaeda> a templating engine that could just take smarty templates would be awsome
[06:27:06] <Hooloovoo> Anyone know where i can see what's being worked on for the next major jquery release?
[06:27:48] <devkinetic> how do i debug an $.ajax function in firebug
[06:31:16] <XeruX> How can I check if a certain div (class='error') already exists inside another div, at the same level (don't check child elements for said div) ?
[06:34:44] <MacroMan> XeruX: if ($('.error').count!=0)
[06:40:12] <Poetro> MacroMan: r u sure about .count? it should be .length
[06:40:44] <MacroMan> Poetro: Err, yeah, I think your right
[06:40:55] <MacroMan> sorry. .length it is
[06:49:05] <poppiez> how do you trigger a click event on an "a" tag when the click handler is applied on its parent using .delegate?
[06:49:22] <poppiez> $('a:first').trigger('click'); doesn't trigger the handler
[06:49:44] <anli_> I am trying to read an int array posted by jquery in asp.net
[06:50:02] <anli_> Do I need to do this manually?
[06:57:45] <MacroMan> I've just written a function and it doesn't appear to do anything: http://pastebin.com/RN5wsEEa
[06:58:29] <MacroMan> I do actually do have 32 t variables
[06:58:58] <MacroMan> Nothing shows on the console
[06:59:01] <kap0w> your code makes my head hurt
[06:59:17] <MacroMan> Really? It's just a for loop
[06:59:47] <jovrtn> what is this? a for loop for ants?
[06:59:54] <jovrtn> *smash*
[07:00:33] <MacroMan> ants? Is this a joke I'm not understanding?
[07:00:41] <jovrtn> yeah
[07:00:49] <MacroMan> ah OK.
[07:00:51] <jovrtn> I'm not helping, I haven't slept
[07:03:12] <kap0w> MacroMan: are you sure that routine_clear gets invoked? and are you sure that you can pass variable names to clearTimeout like that?
[07:09:14] <bobbytek> how can I get the previous element by type, even if it is not directly to the left?
[07:09:29] <bobbytek> I tried prevUntil("select", "select")
[07:09:33] <bobbytek> that doesn't seem to work
[07:10:08] <bobbytek> prevUntil("select", "select").prev() ?
[07:10:15] <bobbytek> I  guess that's it
[07:10:42] <bobbytek> weird though
[07:13:07] <wycks> anyone know if there are plans for jquery ui's draggable to work on multiple elements at once
[07:13:25] <fn> how can I change the value of an <object><param value="..."> using jquery?
[07:13:27] <Chris_____> Crap... stuck in a circular loop in json >.< Thought I couldgo around it by making my own json encoder, but that one needs to go through all the child nodes, and the child nodes points to the parents and I'm stuck with the very thing I've been spending two days trying to get away from >.<
[07:14:55] <MacroMan> kap0w: yes, according to w3schools, that's how it's done: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_cleartimeout.asp
[07:15:27] <binarym> i have an URL that need a form and return a zipfile. I call it using jquery's .post(), i can see the HTTP server return correctly (HTTP 200) but my file isn't downloading
[07:15:57] <binarym> and when i try a callback for .post with function(data) { document.write(data) } it fucked up my webpage
[07:16:11] <binarym> is there a way to launch file downloading more elegant ?
[07:16:29] <MacroMan> Here is a more complete example of what I am doing: http://pastebin.com/nGtr53js
[07:18:04] <MacroMan> binarym: You need to set the headers correctly to force the browser to download the file. I would be tempted to do this from PHP rather that jquery. Here is a good article: http://www.vijayjoshi.org/2008/11/25/how-to-allow-users-to-download-files-in-php/
[07:18:39] <fALSO> Hi!
[07:18:51] <fALSO> A quick question
[07:18:54] <fALSO> $("input[name=acao_id]").click(function() {
[07:19:08] <fALSO> how can I make this work on a element that is added to the page via ajax ?
[07:20:16] <MacroMan> fALSO: Search the jquery api docs for .on
[07:20:21] <MacroMan> .on()
[07:20:51] <binarym> MacroMan: ok, thx. I'm using django, but i'll adapt :)
[07:21:02] <MacroMan> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:21:04] <MacroMan> np
[07:21:08] <fALSO> .on ?
[07:21:10] <binarym> MacroMan: i ever do that ...
[07:21:11] <fALSO> ok
[07:21:13] <binarym> :(
[07:21:31] <fALSO> that way it will work ?
[07:21:34] <fALSO> im going to try thanks
[07:21:35] <fALSO> :)
[07:22:14] <binarym> MacroMan: i think the problem is in my callback
[07:22:19] <binarym> what must i do in it ?
[07:22:29] <binarym> isn't document.write(data) a bit "rude" ?
[07:23:06] <MacroMan> binarym: Use .append() or .replaceWith()
[07:23:23] <binarym> ok, i'll try this :)
[07:23:25] <fALSO> macroman,  it still doesnt work
[07:23:35] <MagmaRules> Guys I'm trying to do a drag and drop interface where the dragged elements from a list can be dropped in order like the sortable in jqueryui. If i apply sortable to the original list i end up being able to sort those elements. I only wanted to be able to drag elements to before or after a list in a container (not move the original list).
[07:23:36] <fALSO> i used : $("input[name=acao_id]").on("click", function(event){
[07:23:57] <MagmaRules> is this possible?
[07:24:26] <MacroMan> fALSO: I had the same problem a while ago. It's quite fiddly. You need to declare the click event AFTER the ajax call. I usually put it in the callback function for the ajax
[07:25:05] <fALSO> hum
[07:25:09] <fALSO> nice idea
[07:25:23] <fALSO> ill report in a few minutes :)
[07:25:30] <sphinxxx> fALSO: use .on()
[07:25:40] <sphinxxx> ah
[07:25:45] <RodrigO23> iai pessoal
[07:25:53] <RodrigO23> tem alguem do brasil ai
[07:26:06] <fALSO> nice macroman it worked that way :-D
[07:26:29] <MacroMan> fALSO: Great. Ajax can be fiddly sometimes
[07:26:38] <fALSO> hehe the moar i know the better
[07:26:41] <fALSO> thanks for the hint :)
[07:26:45] <MacroMan> np
[07:26:49] <sphinxxx> fALSO: this is the right syntax:  $('#parent').on("click","#target", function(e){
[07:27:17] <fALSO> in that way it doesnt need tha the element be created before that code is interperted ?
[07:27:27] <sphinxxx> right
[07:27:37] <sphinxxx> just use that and everything will work, even stuff added after ajax calls
[07:27:46] <sphinxxx> no need to bind events in the ajax callback
[07:27:54] <fALSO> OK. im going to try it
[07:28:12] <MacroMan> sphinxxx: Nice, thanks for that hint. I've always bound the events in the ajax callback
[07:28:40] <sphinxxx> .on is new to 1.7 I think
[07:29:37] <mikkelb> At http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/hN6c5/25/ (app to neatly present some HTML page designs I did) - anybody know how to move the description from #viewport li into #navigation #explanation?
[07:29:45] <fALSO> yes im using 1.7.1
[07:30:56] <feyd> I'm getting that cryptic IE "'null' is null or not an object" error when making a .load() request. There's no way to paste the whole code base as it's making ajax request to a file on a local server, but I can post the offending function to look at and give you context: http://jsbin.com/usolox/3/edit - it will take some explaination though
[07:33:30] <phawk> Any problems with .css(propertyName, Value) in jQuery 1.7.1 ?
[07:37:14] <MagmaRules> Guys basically I'm trying to do something similar to Codiqa in the jquery mobile site: http://jquerymobile.com/ . You can drag from a widget list but only in the ui is it sortable. Anyone has a tip one how to make this bridge between drag and drop and sortable ?
[07:39:15] <Robbington> Hi I am simulatuing a click event with another click event. This works in all browsers except crome. Any ideas/
[07:39:17] <Robbington> ?
[07:39:33] <alaing> why is $.param returning undefined and undefined? http://pastebin.com/zJAhzuGP
[07:40:12] <Robbington> so $('.somediv').click(function(){ $(this).next('img').click();})
[07:42:47] <fn> alert($('#items div:first').attr(id)); <<< why does this not work?
[07:47:05] <feyd> fn: can you post your markup to jsbin.com or something so we can see it, I'm too lazy to recreate it
[07:48:36] <fn> no it works
[07:48:37] <fn> -.-
[07:48:50] <feyd> fn: then I'm a genius, you're welcome
[07:50:02] <jj3124> Hi all, I think this is a Jquery question...at the following site: http://westburybid.troikos.com/merchant-profiles/, when you click 'advantage tennis' you should have a window pop up that gives info on the business..however this does not happen in IE..any reason that would be involving jquery?
[07:50:29] <alaing> why is $.param returning undefined and undefined? http://pastebin.com/zJAhzuGP
[07:50:41] <feyd> jj3124: works for me
[07:51:09] <jj3124> hrmm, in internet explorer?
[07:51:26] <feyd> jj3124: you should seriously consider making those spans into links, or at least giving them a cursor:pointer in css so they look like theyre clickable
[07:51:29] <feyd> jj3124: and yes, in IE8
[07:52:05] <feyd> jj3124: and ie7
[07:52:10] <jj3124> feyd: I actually didn't write the code for that I'm limited in my web dev skills just helping out a friend
[07:52:26] <jj3124> Interesting..thanks. Must be a specific machine issue then. He may be using IE9, though I see no reason why it would revert back to it not working
[07:52:40] <jj3124> (after working in IE8 and 7 that is)
[07:53:06] <feyd> jj3124: I gotcha. Yea, can't see it happening in 9, I'm checking 6 as well if it will ever finish loading the page
[07:53:16] <alaing> try pressing ctrl+F5 jj3124
[07:53:28] <alaing> it maybe using a cached js file somewhere
[07:53:57] <feyd> jj3124: IE6 works, albeit really slow
[07:54:25] <jj3124> feyd: Thanks for all the different tests :) I'm at work and am restricted in what I can install on this machine and my bud is panicing :)
[07:54:26] <alaing> Works in IE9
[07:54:50] <feyd> jj3124: well assure him he's safe in the older versions of IE
[07:54:56] <jj3124> It works in IE9 too? Then it must be a user error..I'll try the ctrl+F5 trick with him :)
[07:55:03] <alaing> yes
[07:55:20] <alaing> its a fault between the chair and the keyboard
[07:55:32] <chrismou> Hi - we're using several autocompletes in a form, each using the "select" option to trigger an ajax call to grab the data for the next. I'm looking to set it up so that under certain cirumstances, the first box is pre-populated (ie, the label is displayed AND the hidden field is populated with the value), but *hopefully* in such a way that jquery sees the population as a selection, and so executes everything I have set in that autocompletes "select" option. Anyo
[07:55:48] <jj3124> alaing: :P I might save that one
[07:56:01] <chrismou> Or is it likely I'll just have to wait, populate the boxes myself, then just repeat the "select" code?
[07:56:03] <alaing> jj3124: yes see if the ctrl+f5 works especially if its something he has just added to his page
[07:56:56] <jj3124> alaing: Thanks..I am just relieved it is not something wrong with the code or anything because it's been a while since I've done anything beyond basic HTML/CSS
[07:57:34] <feyd> chrismou: jquery has callbacks for the ajax handlers, so you should execute the code in those to ensure it is running after the request succeeds
[07:58:19] <alaing> why is $.param returning undefined and undefined? http://pastebin.com/zJAhzuGP
[07:58:22] <chrismou> feyd: The problem is that ajax is called in the autocomplete "select" - so ideally, I'd like to trigger that using JS
[07:58:49] <chrismou> feyd: Ie, basically just simulate someone typing in a word and making a selection from the list
[07:59:28] <feyd> chrismou: trigger the autocomplete manually without user intervention?
[07:59:29] <Robbington> Anyone know about Crome and mimicing click events?
[07:59:57] <chrismou> feyd: That's what I'm aiming for
[08:00:06] <chrismou> feyd: If that's even possible  :P
[08:00:37] <feyd> chrismou: I know it's possible, but I don't know off hand how to simulate that...yet
[08:01:14] <feyd> chrismou: are you sure you don't want to just trigger the events associated with it, or would you rather actually trigger user key presses and such
[08:01:27] <chrismou> feyd: lol cheers. Good to know it's possible. If no-one here knows right now I'll ask again later!
[08:02:23] <feyd> chrismou: there's .keydown(), .keypress(), and .keyup() jquery events, so I would look into those if you dont want to just trigger the event tied with them
[08:05:25] <ravenzz> does clone() works on any kind of object or just jQuery objects (DOM elements)
[08:05:55] <ravenzz> ?
[08:06:00] <ajpiano> only DOM elements
[08:06:03] <jedimind> iirc its just dom elements
[08:06:07] <ajpiano> if you want to "clone" an object
[08:06:17] <ajpiano> you use var foo = $.extend({}, bar);
[08:06:19] <ravenzz> can I use $.map to create a deep copy?
[08:06:26] <ravenzz> k
[08:06:45] <ajpiano> i think you want $.extend(true, {}, bar) for a deep copy
[08:06:58] <ravenzz> i think so
[08:07:20] <alaing> why is $.param returning undefined and undefined? http://pastebin.com/zJAhzuGP
[08:07:27] <ravenzz> how can it be done in plain js? Does it require a huge function?
[08:08:50] <feyd> if I have something like this: http://jsbin.com/ewawuh/edit#javascript - is it bad to reuse the 'i' amd
[08:08:56] <feyd> 'i' and 'obj' variables?
[08:10:56] <alaing> anyone?
[08:11:27] <chrismou> feyd: Think I may be able to nail it with click(). I'll look into it. Thanks again.
[08:11:39] <feyd> alaing: can you setup your paste on a less-terrible paste bin? jsbin.com is prettier
[08:11:57] <alaing> sure can
[08:12:37] <feyd> chrismou: good luck. I still recommend just calling the method that gets called when a user clicks directly, it will perform better and be easier for you I think, but do what you need to do
[08:13:38] <alaing> feyd: http://jsfiddle.net/Cc9TY/
[08:13:39] <mikkelb> I got these two cases using jQuery Cycle - http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/2Ey2s/ (regular cycler) and http://jsfiddle.net/mikkelb/HTyr5/ (cycles when hovering, knows how to pause and resume)
[08:13:44] <mikkelb> But seeing as how plugins like these got way too much stuff one doesn't need, and reveal more and more annoyances the more you use it - how difficult would it be to convert my two cases to using pure jQuery?
[08:13:49] <alaing> why is $.param returning undefined and undefined? http://jsfiddle.net/Cc9TY/
[08:17:42] <feyd> alaing: I gave it a look. I'm pretty new to javascript, so most of this is over my head. The good news is I recognized the array functions and JSON
[08:20:38] <pifantastic> alaing: $.param takes an object as a parameter, not an array
[08:20:51] <pifantastic> alaing: actually nevermind
[08:21:35] <pifantastic> alaing: ah yes "If the object passed is in an Array, it must be an array of objects in the format returned by .serializeArray()"
[08:21:48] <feyd> if I have something like this: http://jsbin.com/ewawuh/edit#javascript - is it bad to reuse the 'i' and 'obj' variables like I'm doing?
[08:22:46] <pifantastic> feyd: not bad, per say, but this code can be organized in a more "Don't Repeat Yourself" way
[08:23:45] <feyd> pifantastic: of that I have no doubts at all, but I don't know a better way. do you have any example I could learn from or suggestions?
[08:24:38] <pifantastic> feyd: well look at the parts that repeat. This code is basically 2 parts. the first determines which object we're using to create the options HTML, and the second part just iterates over that object and creates the HTML
[08:24:48] <pifantastic> so you only really need 1 for loop
[08:25:10] <feyd> pifantastic: ooo I see what you're saying
[08:25:18] <feyd> pifantastic: awesome, thanks for the advice
[08:25:26] <pifantastic> np
[08:25:52] <alaing> pifantastic: how would I pass that through serialiseArray?
[08:26:58] <alaing> I'm just trying to produce something like &p_arg_names=G_SEARCH&p_arg_values=bla&p_arg_names=G_TYPE&p_arg_values=-1
[08:28:33] <pifantastic> alaing: it's not really a good idea to have multiple GET params with the same name
[08:28:50] <alaing> its part of a POST call
[08:29:06] <alaing> I know I'm using a really crappy server
[08:29:19] <alaing> ORACLE Application Express 3.0
[08:29:42] <alaing> they have their own "ajax" api whcih is rubbish
[08:30:00] <pifantastic> alaing: normally this would work: http://jsfiddle.net/ZQRdt/1/
[08:30:07] <Afflicto> How can I easily load a php file from a full-path directory? like "root/sys/config.php" instead of having to count backwards like "../../../" etc? I want it dynamic anyway :P
[08:30:11] <pifantastic> but since you are repeating the names, it de-dupes them
[08:30:13] <Afflicto> shit that was for php. sorry.
[08:30:15] <alaing> so I'm trying to re-engineer it to use jQuery Ajax
[08:30:54] <ajpiano> feyd: the key to DRYing it out is to like, only write the same logic once (obvs) and to get those budgetStyle etc etc out of the global scope... something like http://jsbin.com/ewawuh/2/edit
[08:30:58] <pifantastic> Afflicto: http://php.net/manual/en/function.realpath.php ?
[08:30:59] <alaing> pifantastic: that might just work
[08:31:18] <pifantastic> Afflicto: Be careful, if you are using user input to load a file, that can be very insecure!
[08:31:28] <alaing> I dont need it as an array I'm just after the url bit
[08:31:45] <alaing> pifantastic: let me try that quickly
[08:32:08] <feyd> ajpiano: I see, thanks for the example
[08:32:57] <sphinxxx> anything familiar with the Recaptcha object ?

[08:39:50] <monk12> hello all, Im using the Masked Input plugin, and also Jquery Validate plugin. is there anyway to turn off auto-validation for Jquery Validate? i think its looking at things like maxlength on the field and putting an error class on it if its not 10chars (only when i use Masked Input plugin though, doesnt give me any errors when i use Validate on the form by itself i beleive)
[08:40:02] <monk12> I just want jquery Validate to work off the Rules
[08:41:04] <monk12> Let me set up a JSFiddle to play with and hook it up here.
[08:41:33] <BaruchHashem> how do i add opacity:1 to this sript? http://pastie.org/3678748

[08:43:39] <monk12> Also may want to set the mozilla opacity css property, but I dont bother nowadays
[08:48:41] <feyd> I'm getting an 'null is null or not an object' error in IE when using the .load() jquery handler and passing a select value as a parameter. This works in every browser except IE, and I have no idea why

[08:57:10] <velocitykendal> Using UI Tabs with fx: height: 'toggle'
[08:57:10] <velocitykendal> How would I trigger a slide up (i.e. collapse tab) from a click event from other elements on the page?
[08:57:28] <mack____> hi! I think I found a regression between jQuery 1.7.1 and 1.7.2.
[08:57:40] <mack____> The simplest code that triggers it is:
[08:57:42] <mack____> $(function() {
[08:57:42] <mack____> 			console.log("result of data", $("<div/>").data("non_existent_key", undefined)  );
[08:57:42] <mack____> 		});
[08:57:50] <ericandrewlewis> i binded a function to document ready, but it's not firing. could anything be unbinding it?
[08:57:58] <mack____> it says result of data undefined in jQuery 1.7.1
[08:58:09] <mack____> and result of data [div] in jQuery 1.7.2
[08:58:13] <ericandrewlewis> basic stuff which should work - jQuery(document).ready( function(){ console.log("oh"); });
[08:58:29] <mack____> can someone check it to see if they can duplicate ?
[08:58:53] <feyd> velocitykendal: the UI tabs have a collapsible: true argument that lets you close them by clicking the tab itself, but you're looking to close the tab with a non-tab element somewhere else on the page, right?
[08:59:02] <BillCriswell> ericandrewlewis: Does the error log say anything?
[08:59:14] <velocitykendal> @feyd - correct
[08:59:22] <ericandrewlewis> the console shows a couple of unrelated errors BillCriswell
[08:59:44] <ericandrewlewis> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'fancybox', Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'datepicker', Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL
[09:00:04] <Robbington> Does any one know why $('img').trigger('click') doesnt work in crome, but fine in all the other browsers??
[09:00:25] <BillCriswell> That could be the reason why it's not working.
[09:00:34] <feyd> velocitykendal: this isn't specific to tabs, but it should carry over as they run on the same code base: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4681320/can-i-expand-collapse-content-of-jquery-ui-accordion-by-click-another-elements-t
[09:00:46] <velocitykendal> I have a 'close' link that has slidetoggle on the tabs container, but I somehow need to slide up the tab panels first
[09:00:58] <ericandrewlewis> BillCriswell: i wouldn't imagine so, but i'll try to take care of them first
[09:01:10] <feyd> velocitykendal: it looks like you pass the collapsible argument to true, then use the .activate method with false passed, and run that on whatever element you want to click to close the tabs
[09:02:04] <velocitykendal> will have a go
[09:02:05] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[09:02:11] <sphinxxx> so you can't change language on the fly when using the Recaptcha object?
[09:02:33] <asher^> hey guys, what libraries/technologies should i be looking at to get database-like functionality in the browser (sorting, searching records etc)?
[09:02:42] <velocitykendal> If I want this to happen before the slidetoggle actions on the parent container do I need this in a callback or something?
[09:03:24] <feyd> velocitykendal: that sounds like the best way to go about it. I'm sorry I dont have more info, I've never touched anything with jqUI before
[09:03:52] <velocitykendal> i.e. the click event on the 'close' link needs to do 2 things... firstly collapse tabs, then slide it's parent container up
[09:04:05] <feyd> I'm getting an 'null is null or not an object' error in IE when using the .load() jquery handler and passing a select value as a parameter. This works in every browser except IE, and I have no idea why. First person to help me gets a sweet pic of my man-boobs.
[09:04:13] <feyd> dont all volunteer at once now
[09:04:34] <ericandrewlewis> BillCriswell: you were right! another plugin was tapping into document ready and failing, so i guess it never got to executing mine
[09:04:35] <ericandrewlewis> thanks!
[09:04:37] <BillCriswell> feyd: Can we get a pastie?
[09:04:48] <Robbington> Surely some one knows?
[09:05:13] <feyd> BillCriswell: yes, but the whole code base relies on data retrieved through an ajax request, so it's not a pretty or functional paste, just 1 minute
[09:05:16] <BillCriswell> ericandrewlewis: You had a syntax error. You're overcomplicating it.
[09:05:24] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[09:05:35] <ericandrewlewis> huh?
[09:06:05] <BillCriswell> It's not a big deal, no worried. =(
[09:06:11] <BillCriswell> worries* =)
[09:06:18] <Robbington> Anyone?
[09:06:22] <blaza> do you guys follow some good source on twitter concerning jQuery dev?
[09:07:05] <devkinetic> im writing my first plugin and have everything working in console.log. I'm just trying to get my output onto the page, can anyone see what i'm doing wrong? append() is throwing an error. http://jsfiddle.net/QchXQ/
[09:07:17] <feyd> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/ewawuh/3/edit
[09:07:19] <velocitykendal> .activate doesn't seem to be a method available to UI Tabs http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#method-option
[09:07:31] <AdvoWork> I need to show a table that i've set to display:none but at the same time as adding it to another div, i've tried:  $('#order_line_detail_div'.append($('#cutter_table').show()); but no luck. Any ideas please?
[09:08:16] <feyd> BillCriswell: the error I get occurs just under the $.each() in paperPopulate(). This line: if (type.indexOf(term) !== -1) {
[09:09:17] <feyd> velocitykendal: if you created your own animation to collapse the tab using jquery, you can use the callback in the .animate() method to execute the next bit you need executed
[09:10:01] <velocitykendal> hmm
[09:10:06] <velocitykendal> seems logical
[09:10:23] <feyd> BillCriswell: so what happens is there are a few select elements. They populate on page load, and repopulate when a new item is selected in the 2 main ones, the problem is that IE does it all fine on page load, but when it's called on a select.change(), it breaks
[09:10:32] <velocitykendal> ...just gotta to work out how
[09:11:13] <feyd> velocitykendal: http://api.jquery.com/animate/ - they have plenty of examples and all the documentation here. Just try different things and know what CSS you'll want to animate

[09:20:50] <Robbington> trigger doesnt work in crome, there are no errors, the click event will log out, but it wont fire the click event on the image below the click
[09:20:51] <feyd> Robbington: put your code in jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net

[09:39:29] <improwizacja> feyd yes this is it
[09:39:42] <feyd> improwizacja: you need to pay me 1 billion dollars now
[09:39:45] <minna> sphinxxx: Thanks, i solved it :)
[09:40:03] <improwizacja> 1 bylon awgan dolar?
[09:40:06] <devkinetic> i'm using $.get to retrieve the html of a page and when i try to print it out it just shows as "[object XMLHttpRequest]" on my page
[09:40:12] <feyd> improwizacja: ok you're welcome bye
[09:40:22] <improwizacja> :D
[09:40:27] <improwizacja> thx alot ;D
[09:42:47] <johnkpaul> http://jsperf.com/native-browser-events-vs-jquery-trigger
[09:42:55] <johnkpaul> anyone mind trying that out?
[09:43:13] <feyd> Robbington: sorry, remind me again what you want the image to do on click
[09:44:50] <Robbington> the image has a click event already bound to it by a js plug in, I need to simulate that click
[09:45:09] <Robbington> $(img).click() and trigger('click') dont work in crome
[09:45:21] <Robbington> but are fine in all other browsers
[09:47:34] <Eviltwin> Robbington: Pretty sure it's well-documented that .click() and .trigger('click') will only trigger listeners bound with jQuery
[09:47:57] <Eviltwin> Because in most browsers it's impossible to generate a real event
[09:49:05] <deAtog> I think I found a bug in jQuery 1.7.2 $.isPlainObject() returns false for all objects that have a nodeType attribute. IE: $.isPlainObject({nodeType:'leaf'}) will return false
[09:51:26] <Eviltwin> deAtog: How do you propose to fix that?
[09:51:43] <feyd> BillCriswell: does that make sense? The function itself executes successfully when the page loads in IE, and that has never not worked, but when you call the function on a select .change(), it breaks, saying type has no value, which I'm assuming is because IE is executing it before the ajax requests completes or something
[09:52:15] <Robbington> So why does this work fine in IE, FF, Opera, safari and not Crome?
[09:52:19] <deAtog> Eviltwin: I was thinking maybe checking obj.nodeType && !obj.hasOwnProperty('nodeType')
[09:52:29] <foo> I am using accordion in jquery, and I am defining it like this: http://pastebin.com/2Ka8V1Kw - the problem, though, is that I have a ul inside of the accordion, and it's being treated like an accordion li, and not like a regular ul item. Any tips on how to get the ul bullet point list to be normal and not take on any jquery magic?
[09:52:51] <feyd> Robbington: that I don't know, I'm still working on a test though, I haven't forgotten about you
[09:53:10] <Eviltwin> deAtog: Can you either mention this in #jquery-dev to see what they think or just file a bug and mention your solution?
[09:53:46] <deAtog> Eviltwin: sure..
[09:54:26] <amin3d> In the name of Alah,Hi all,I want to simulate keypress is there any solution? my problem is to simulte pressing three keys ,by pressing three keys a dialog will popup , I have another button i want to by clicking on it that dialog will be shown
[09:54:37] <Eviltwin> ?js String({})
[09:54:40] <bot-t> Eviltwin: "[object Object]"
[09:54:43] <Eviltwin> ?js String(document.body)
[09:54:44] <bot-t> Eviltwin: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[09:54:48] <Eviltwin> Grr
[09:55:27] <Eviltwin> amin3d: Are the things expecting these keys listening for them using jQuery?
[09:55:46] <Eviltwin> deAtog: I'm wondering if that test might also be valuable
[09:56:05] <Eviltwin> At least here String(document.body) comes back as "[object HTMLBodyElement]"
[09:56:13] <Eviltwin> Instead of "[object Object]"
[09:56:16] <BillCriswell> feyd: I thought this would be quick but it's not. You seem to be right about the issue, though.
[09:56:21] <amin3d> Eviltwin:yes
[09:56:31] <feyd> BillCriswell: I apologize for taking up your time
[09:56:48] <BillCriswell> feyd: It's no problem at all. I just wish I could have helped quicker haha.
[09:57:03] <feyd> BillCriswell: i'll try throwing a delay on it, doubt it will work but who knows
[09:57:14] <Eviltwin> amin3d: There's an example of simulating a keypress here: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[09:57:37] <feyd> well robbington left right when I have an answer for him, how nice
[09:58:51] <feyd> if anyone was curious, chrome didn't mess anything up, it detects click events just like every browser: http://jsfiddle.net/H6C5y/1/
[09:59:52] <Eviltwin> Chrome detects click events?
[09:59:54] <Eviltwin> That's good to know.
[10:00:15] <powered> y
[10:00:19] <mikkelb> Eviltwin: whats up man?
[10:00:29] <feyd> Eviltwin: I know, shocking new discovery
[10:00:30] <mikkelb> you dont read your pms?
[10:00:42] <Eviltwin> mikkelb: I saw them but haven't had time to look at them.
[10:00:48] <Eviltwin> At the links in them
[10:00:53] <mikkelb> oh ok
[10:00:54] <feyd> Eviltwin: a fellow named robbington came in claiming chrome didn't detect them, but it works fine
[10:01:18] <Eviltwin> We also prefer to keep as much conversation as possible regarding jQuery in here
[10:01:28] <Eviltwin> So that everyone can contribute
[10:02:01] <mikkelb> i can understand that
[10:02:12] <mikkelb> but i assume you want your money first
[10:02:32] <mikkelb> they've been wired to paypal, should take a day or two to get there
[10:02:33] <Eviltwin> Actually I think I'd rather look at how much is involved first :P
[10:02:40] <rndmz> asd
[10:02:41] <rndmz> hello
[10:02:44] <rndmz> O:
[10:03:24] <mikkelb> absolutely
[10:03:29] <mikkelb> as for that menu, i decided to drop it
[10:03:44] <mikkelb> as cool as your code was, i think my idea for making it in the first place was rather weak
[10:03:54] <mikkelb> so i just went for a regular dropdown without all the switching this and that
[10:11:12] <Eviltwin> mikkelb: I don't have a chance to look at it right now but I might this evening.
[10:13:49] <mikkelb> Eviltwin: sounds good
[10:13:58] <mikkelb> Eviltwin: roughly how many hours is that till?
[10:14:20] <Eviltwin> Probably going to be at least 7 until I can devote real time to it
[10:14:31] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon everyone.
[10:14:37] <mikkelb> well its no rush
[10:14:56] <mikkelb> i just need to know whether it sounds ok to you
[10:15:00] <mikkelb> within 4 hours
[10:16:59] <Eviltwin> mikkelb: 1 sounds pretty easy for sure, and 2 looks like it should be easy as well
[10:17:07] <mikkelb> aaah nice nice
[10:17:12] <Eviltwin> I'd actually prefer to code first if that's okay
[10:17:15] <mikkelb> cool :)
[10:17:18] <mikkelb> really?
[10:17:24] <mikkelb> well the money is yours regardless
[10:17:27] <Eviltwin> But I won't be able to do that for 7 hours
[10:17:53] <mikkelb> sounds good man
[10:17:54] <Eviltwin> I sometimes get bored and don't like to already be committed to helping someone with their issue
[10:18:04] <Eviltwin> Which is why I prefer to work this like tips
[10:18:11] <mikkelb> oh i understand
[10:18:11] <Eviltwin> Rather than payment to help with an issue
[10:18:11] <mikkelb> hehe yeah
[10:18:17] <mikkelb> takes the stress away i reckon
[10:18:28] <mikkelb> but this payment is actually for your previous help with that menu
[10:18:35] <mikkelb> well part of it is
[10:18:50] <mikkelb> but sure np
[10:18:51] <Eviltwin> Well that makes me feel better :D
[10:19:38] <mikkelb> :)
[10:23:50] <minna> When did jquery get so big? :-(
[10:24:15] <gnarf> minna: http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size
[10:24:29] <Eviltwin> mikkelb: Two days gao
[10:24:31] <Eviltwin> Err
[10:24:36] <Eviltwin> minna: Two days ago
[10:25:06] <Eviltwin> gnarf: Although the current goal it to slim it down a bit, right?
[10:25:08] <minna> Uff :-(
[10:25:08] <johnkpaul> so big meanig 291 more bytes gzipped?
[10:26:20] <Eviltwin> gnarf: Huh, I wouldn't have expected minified to be so close to gzipped
[10:26:27] <gnarf> Eviltwin: we are actively trying to trim filesize - yes... however some of it will have to wait until certain things can be removed - others will be patched into a "back compat" plugin, etc
[10:27:00] <gnarf> Eviltwin / minna: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj5JJFjq9rZDdEhhbEwzYUwyTVpOY2tfdDk5SlNpLXc
[10:27:38] <minna> Hm, what old stuff will be removed?
[10:28:00] <gnarf> i gotta say - two of my suggestions are the biggest minuses :)
[10:28:12] <haizum> why haven't they made .on() work with dynamic content like .one() in jquery 1.7???
[10:28:28] <johnkpaul> haizum: they did
[10:28:34] <johnkpaul> you just need to give different parameters
[10:28:36] <gnarf> haizum: you'll need to explain that a bit more, not sure what you mean
[10:28:36] <johnkpaul> ?on
[10:28:37] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:28:38] <haizum> it would be easy to do i'm sure and save people from having to use $.data in order to preserve a true/false statement
[10:29:03] <gnarf> also minna - the largest increase in jQuery's file size was in 1.3 and 1.4
[10:29:24] <minna> I have gotten used to using .on on everything now, it's noticably faster.
[10:29:45] <Eviltwin> minna: It's a >100,000% speed increase over .bind
[10:29:52] <Eviltwin> Quite impressive
[10:29:59] <minna> Hm, but i currently use $.ajax for well, all ajax stuff... what should we use instead, if it's going to get removed?
[10:30:14] <minna> Eviltwin: Yes, i never used bind.
[10:30:15] <Eviltwin> minna: $.ajax isn't going to be removed
[10:30:24] <rue> Is that a decimal comma?
[10:30:32] <minna> Eviltwin: or at least i think i didnt, maybe some other bindings used it.
[10:30:35] <gnarf> minna: where did you infer that ajax was going away?
[10:30:54] <gnarf> just the .complete / .success / .error methods on jqXHR's
[10:31:02] <haizum> gnarf: i'm using infinite scroll to load content dynamically w/ ajax, and using .one() would be ideal in my situation, because i only want to handle each element once (i'm simply applying a style). however, it only works with elements on the first page. only .on() seems to work dynamically, so i'm forced to use $.data in order to preserve a piece of data holding whether or not the element has
[10:31:02] <haizum> been passed the change yet with a "true" statement
[10:31:05] <minna> Maybe i missunderstood the text? "Can we refactor to allow basic ajax functions without the need for $.ajax/Callbacks/Deferreds?  Basically expose the transports in some bare form.						"
[10:31:17] <Eviltwin> gnarf: Basically the $.ajax({success: ... }) syntax should still work
[10:31:21] <gnarf> its been deprecated in 1.7
[10:31:38] <minna> gnarf: So what to use instead of complete, success and error? Because i currently use them.
[10:32:05] <gnarf> Eviltwin/minna: $.ajax().done > success() ; .fail() > error() ; .always() > complete
[10:32:07] <Eviltwin> minna: see ?$.ajax
[10:32:08] <bot-t> minna, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:32:13] <ajpiano> minna: $.ajax({ complete: fn, success: fn, error: fn}) isn't going anywhere.
[10:32:19] <ajpiano> just the aliases on the returned jqxhr
[10:32:22] <haizum> i could save myself 10 lines of code by using .one()
[10:32:28] <haizum> also its just nicer
[10:32:33] <Eviltwin> It's in keeping with the actual deferred names
[10:32:46] <minna> ajpiano: Ah, ok :)
[10:32:58] <haizum> i find it hard to believe and frankly, careless that its not implemented into jquery
[10:33:03] <ploo> I'm trying to update a drop down and have it call the onchange code. I'm doing a $(select:[name=NAME]").val("2"); this works but doesn't call my onchange in the <select> How do I mimic a click in a drop down?
[10:33:28] <minna> haizum: .one?
[10:33:50] <haizum> minna: .one() not working with dynamically-loaded page content, yes.
[10:34:00] <gnarf> haizum: .one( events [, selector] [, data], handler(eventObject) )
[10:34:29] <ploo> .change() is my friend now :)
[10:34:30] <ploo> hehe
[10:34:31] <Eviltwin> minna: 1.8 is getting rid of selectors but you shouldn't be using those anyway.
[10:34:36] <gnarf> although i'm not sure that is "per element" more likely its "per container"
[10:34:39] <Eviltwin> It's much easier to just traverse the DOM
[10:34:39] <ajpiano> haizum: it's manifestly untrue that .one() "doesn't work" with dynamically loaded content
[10:35:03] <ajpiano> haizum: at best it's true that it doesn't have a built in delegation helper for dealing with "Future elements"
[10:35:05] <minna> Eviltwin: getting rid of selectors?!?
[10:35:13] <Eviltwin> :D
[10:35:39] <minna> You troll?
[10:36:04] <Eviltwin> No, I keep people on their toes, jQuery-wise
[10:36:04] <haizum> ajpiano: pardon my terminology then, however it remains that it doesn't function with my "future elements" in the fashion that .on() does, and the fact that they are designed to essentially do the same thing, albeit on a different level of elements, baffles me
[10:36:42] <minna> Eviltwin: Um, ok, i'm to tired to not take everything seriously.. :-/
[10:37:00] <ajpiano> haizum: if i've learned anything in several years of being heavily involved in jquery, it's that righteous indignation about corner cases in the API doesn't help :)
[10:37:01] <gnarf> minna: we will probably remove the "non-standard" selectors :file :input :etc
[10:37:10] <Eviltwin> haizum: For example $("<div>", { text: "Hello" }).one("click", function() { alert("Hello!") }).appendTo("body") works just fine
[10:37:45] <Eviltwin> That's a dynamically added element right there
[10:37:55] <haizum> perhaps in other cases such as that, yes, however in using infinite scroll + masonry here for some reason it refuses to *shrug*
[10:38:05] <minna> gnarf: Ah, i don't mind that, never use those.
[10:38:06] <Eviltwin> And .one even supports the delegate syntax
[10:38:18] <ajpiano> haizum: .one is an alias to .on
[10:38:21] <ajpiano> in jquery 1.7
[10:38:25] <ajpiano> it should work just fine
[10:38:34] <Eviltwin> gnarf: Those were only ever for laziness, I think
[10:38:42] <Eviltwin> gnarf: People who insisted on typing fewer chars
[10:38:45] <gnarf> Eviltwin: but its not quite what you think: http://jsfiddle.net/mLttg/
[10:38:58] <johnkpaul> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.one
[10:39:13] <johnkpaul> wow, is everything an alias to on in 1.7?
[10:39:13] <gnarf> .one's "selector" syntax makes it for the first click on any delegate, not each delegate
[10:39:20] <minna> Hm, im getting a very strange bug.
[10:39:30] <ajpiano> johnkpaul: yes
[10:39:38] <ajpiano> gnarf: hmm
[10:39:43] <Eviltwin> gnarf: Oh, yeah, well I actually hadn't even thought that far
[10:40:09] <ajpiano> it would be hard for us to write it in such a way that it could guess exactly what the user would want in every case
[10:40:11] <Eviltwin> I suppose what he really wants is a .on() where he sets data on the element
[10:40:32] <z3yo> Hi there
[10:40:32] <Eviltwin> And doesn't run his code if that data is present
[10:41:16] <haizum> i've gotten it to work by using selectors in the .delegate fashion, but it only loads the first image in the selection filter for some reason. go figure
[10:41:40] <haizum> by "load", i mean make it visible
[10:41:43] <kristofer91> Is there a way that when using jquery on website
[10:41:49] <haizum> by using a .fadein effect
[10:41:52] <kristofer91> that you dont actually see the loading of the li and effects ?
[10:42:07] <kristofer91> i mean i have an accordion and everything the page loads it's span across the whole website and is really ugly
[10:42:12] <kristofer91> everytime
[10:42:26] <z3yo> Just an easy question, I've an element, I want to get his html content AND itself (not just its content), I find nothing in the doc :s
[10:42:57] <ajpiano> ?g jquery outerhtml yelotofu @ z3yo
[10:42:58] <bot-t> z3yo, jQuery: outerHTML | Yelotofu - http://www.yelotofu.com/2008/08/jquery-outerhtml/
[10:43:54] <z3yo> Thx ajpiano, it is what I was looking for :)
[10:44:22] <jeremycook> Hey guys. Quick question.
[10:45:03] <jeremycook> I want to remove a set of dom nodes from the page but retain them in a variable so that they can be used as content for a lightbox. What would be the best way to do this?
[10:45:20] <gnarf> haizum: hey look, a plugin: http://jsfiddle.net/KRjB9/

[10:45:30] * gnarf feels a little like ben_alman now
[10:45:35] <ben_alman> wat
[10:46:05] <gnarf> ben_alman: writing plugins to solve shit ;)
[10:46:25] <ben_alman> i told dave that data should ALWAYS be an object so arbitrary other props could be added
[10:46:26] <jeremycook> johnkpaul: Thanks. I missed that one in the manual.
[10:46:35] <ben_alman> but he denied me
[10:46:51] <johnkpaul> no problem jeremycook, have fun
[10:47:02] <ben_alman> like elems.on(type, { eventdata: 'foo', once: true }, fn);
[10:47:03] <ben_alman> etc
[10:47:04] <ben_alman> oh well
[10:47:29] <Eviltwin> Damn it, gnarf. I was like half way there
[10:47:38] <gnarf> Eviltwin: first!
[10:47:40] <mattyh88> hey, what's wrong with this code please? It's telling me, unexpected token: https://gist.github.com/2218288
[10:47:41] <Eviltwin> But I was going to use .one because it unbinds
[10:47:51] <ben_alman> unbinding is smarter
[10:47:56] <Eviltwin> And was also going to use it to assign the guids
[10:48:24] <gnarf> Eviltwin: keep goin then
[10:48:42] <Zephr0> how do i remove a placeholder from a .sortable object, i have tried setting placeholder:false, in the options
[10:48:51] <Eviltwin> But I realize not you actually don't want to unbind
[10:49:34] <Eviltwin> Grr
[10:50:50] <gnarf> Eviltwin: yeah, the "delegated" aspect makes unbind not possible
[10:50:54] <gnarf> although holy shit
[10:50:56] <gnarf> i got a better one
[10:51:27] <gnarf> container.on("click", "li:not(.clickedon)", function() { $(this).addClass("clickedon"); });
[10:51:55] <Eviltwin> Well yeah but now there's an extra class there :P
[10:51:55] <johnkpaul> mattyh88: check your if line
[10:51:58] <gnarf> although the use of :not slows the selector matching down dramatically
[10:51:59] <johnkpaul> there aren't enough parentheasis
[10:52:08] <johnkpaul> parentheses
[10:52:13] <Eviltwin> But it's only matching on click
[10:52:27] <ben_alman> elem.on("click", function fn(e) { /* do stuff */ $(this).off(e.type, fn); });
[10:52:33] <Eviltwin> Not like mouseover
[10:52:40] <Eviltwin> ben_alman: Issue is elements added in the future
[10:52:40] <gnarf> ben_alman: with delegation?
[10:52:51] <ben_alman> elem.on("click", "li", function fn(e) { /* do stuff */ $(this).off(e.type, "li", fn); });
[10:52:58] <ben_alman> wait
[10:52:59] <ben_alman> oh
[10:53:01] <ben_alman> delegation
[10:53:08] <gnarf> ben_alman: :)
[10:53:10] <Eviltwin> We want each element to have the listener run once
[10:53:15] <ben_alman> yeah, you need per-element state
[10:53:17] <Eviltwin> Including elements added in the future
[10:53:19] <Eviltwin> Yup
[10:53:19] <gnarf> i think .data() is prolly best
[10:53:28] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[10:53:29] <gnarf> although the class might be useful too
[10:53:33] <ben_alman> or a class
[10:53:41] <ben_alman> class would make the selector easiest
[10:53:48] <ben_alman> i'd use the class to keep the code small
[10:53:52] <gnarf> it would be easiest if you could add a class to all the lis
[10:53:58] <ben_alman> container.on("click", "li:not(.clickedon)", function() { $(this).addClass("clickedon"); });
[10:54:00] <ben_alman> like that
[10:54:05] <mattyh88> johnkpaul, thx!
[10:54:09] <ben_alman> ok afk
[10:54:17] <johnkpaul> mattyh88: no problem
[10:54:23] <minna> .parent and closest i can search up the tree for selectors, are there any other ways of selecting an element up the tree?
[10:54:27] <gnarf> like elem.on("click", "li.fresh", function() { $(this).removeClass("fresh"); }) would be dramatcally faster selector engineing
[10:54:30] <johnkpaul> try getting a text editor with syntax highlighting mattyh88
[10:54:33] <johnkpaul> and you'll see it fairly quickly
[10:54:58] <mattyh88> yeh .. it's good editor .. syntax is set to php though :p
[10:54:58] <mattyh88> hehehe
[10:55:13] <Eviltwin> gnarf: This was insane: http://jsperf.com/crazy-selectors
[10:57:22] <Porpado> does anyone know why the doicument ready event might be working for a linked script but not another one embedded within script tags (using them both simultaneously)
[10:57:41] <Eviltwin> Porpado: A typo?
[10:59:17] <gnarf> Eviltwin: looks insane, although i think the main reason its expensive is the :not()'s
[10:59:22] <gnarf> ?attribute ends with selector
[10:59:23] <bot-t> gnarf, Attribute Ends With Selector [name$="value"] - Selects elements that have the specified attribute with a value ending exactly with a given string. http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[10:59:25] <gnarf> ?not selector
[10:59:25] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[11:00:03] <gnarf> nevermind
[11:00:19] <gnarf> those are both css spec - its slow cuz its a triple attribute selector prolly
[11:00:49] <gnarf> I'm really glad I made this category on the api site: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/jquery-selector-extensions/
[11:01:11] <minna> nvm
[11:01:19] <Sealee1> Hi all, have a real noob issue that I was hoping to get some help with - http://bit.ly/Hi4J6N - Can't manage to 'keep' the url i'd like to pass.. getting it from a jquery click function. Can anyone give me a hand? TIA
[11:01:33] <Zephr0> how do i remove a placeholder from a .sortable object, i have tried setting placeholder:false, in the options
[11:02:54] <mszola> Hey, I'm having a strange problem with jquery dialog
[11:03:18] <mszola> http://pastie.org/3679563
[11:03:36] <ajpiano> Sealee1: you could do soemthing like this: http://www.jspaste.com/?id=380
[11:03:53] <ajpiano> Sealee1: when you use var, it makes a local variable, so the dialog button callback doesn't know about the "url" variable
[11:03:54] <mszola> I show the html within the dialog window that shows up. apparently for some odd reason, when you click that h4, it invokes the close dialog function
[11:03:57] <ajpiano> but using a global "url" is fail city
[11:03:57] <mszola> any idea why?
[11:04:44] <Sealee1> youre the effing man
[11:05:20] <kedarm> Is there a jQuery API to get number of rows in a <tbody> or number of <li>'s in a <ul>?
[11:05:29] <Sealee1> knew someone could fart an answer out with little effort, and ya, i saw that url was undefined, wasnt sure how to get it available where i needed. your sample works great though, thanks again
[11:05:42] <Woet> kedarm: $("tbody tr").length()
[11:05:48] <Woet> kedarm: $("ul li").length()
[11:05:49] <Woet> etc
[11:05:50] <ajpiano> ?linaf @ Woet
[11:05:51] <bot-t> Woet, .length is not a function, it is a property. $("div").length, not $("div").length()
[11:05:58] <kedarm> Woet: Whoa! thanks!
[11:05:58] <Woet> ajpiano; oops, sorry
[11:06:04] <Woet> kedarm: remove the () from there
[11:06:21] <Woet> ajpiano: thanks for the hint that i've worked for too long and should go home :)
[11:06:32] <mszola> I'm having a strange problem with Jquery UI dialog.
[11:06:37] <mszola> http://pastie.org/3679563
[11:07:07] <mszola> if you click on the h4 as shown in the html section
[11:07:16] <mszola> it invokes the overlayclickclose function.
[11:07:21] <kedarm> ajpiano: thanks, tffm (too fast for me) :-)
[11:08:08] <mszola> does anyone have any idea why?
[11:08:20] <n00by> \join #rubyonrails
[11:08:26] <n00by> damn =)
[11:09:00] <mszola> nobody working with jquery ui dialog today?
[11:09:57] <Eviltwin> mszola: Gotta learn the art of patience
[11:10:25] <mszola> yeah, patience. How long will that take? ;)
[11:10:40] <Joker_> anyone around?
[11:10:52] <mszola> Anyway, not impatient for the answer but wanting to know if someone can look at it.
[11:10:59] <Joker_> i have a question regarding QUnit
[11:11:43] <AbstractAce> Sealee1, whos the effin man
[11:12:21] <Joker_> i've written some tests using QUnit to test some code i have
[11:12:37] <Joker_> and for some reason, right now, the first test in the list runs, followed by the last test, then the 2nd to last, 3rd to last, etc
[11:12:44] <Joker_> i want the tests to run in the order i wrote them in
[11:12:57] <Joker_> i already set reorder = false in the qunit file
[11:13:20] <Joker_> and i tried to clear sessionstorage but i don't think it worked
[11:13:22] <Joker_> any ideas?
[11:15:26] <tasuki> hi everyone, is this the place to ask about jquery-ui ?
[11:15:48] <Eviltwin> Technically yes
[11:16:06] <Joker_> if i'm in the wrong place, can someone please direct me to a place where i can ask about qunit?
[11:16:14] <tasuki> Eviltwin, splendid, thanks
[11:16:57] <g0rd0n_> i ahve a button set of 4 radio buttons, but when i do a $('input[name=radio]:checked').index() on them, i get: 0, 2, 4, 6 instead of the expected 0,1,2,3... any idea as to why?
[11:17:30] <devkinetic> anyone aware of a slider plugin that i can integrate with content i'm pulling with ajax?
[11:24:37] <Zephr0> how do i remove a placeholder from a .sortable object, i have tried setting placeholder:false, in the options
[11:26:05] <tasuki> what exactly is the relation between jQuery and jQuery-UI ?
[11:26:08] <tasuki> I have a problem with addClass not working as expected for jQuery UI 1.8 combined with jQuery 1.6+ ... see demo: http://tmp.tasuki.org/addclass-broken.html
[11:26:27] <ajpiano> jquery ui is a ui toolkit built on top of jquery
[11:27:10] <gnarf> :( poor MySQL server: http://bugs.jquery.com/
[11:28:29] <mszola> tasuki: what browser?
[11:28:50] <mszola> tasuki: working on fireflox
[11:30:10] <tasuki> mszola: oh, sorry, forgot to mention - I tested with chromium 17 and firefox 3.6, both under linux
[11:30:32] <mszola> why do you have clicked, 1000?
[11:30:51] <Eviltwin> jQuery UI supports transitioning to a class
[11:30:58] <Eviltwin> As an animation
[11:30:59] <mszola> thanks eviltwin.
[11:31:08] <mszola> I was looking at docs but didn't see it
[11:31:19] <Eviltwin> That's because it's specific to jQuery UI
[11:31:31] <tasuki> and sorry again, I wasn't explicit - the class gets added, but there's no transition when the element doesn't have the class attribute
[11:31:54] <tasuki> when the class attribute is there, even if empty, it all works fine
[11:32:15] <tasuki> (for any browser and jquery+jquery-ui combination)
[11:32:27] <mszola> I see it now. That's weird.
[11:33:00] <tasuki> I haven't tried to debug it much yet, it seems tricky :)
[11:33:26] <mszola> I have a bug in dialog and sadly no one is up to figure it out.
[11:33:38] <ajpiano> tasuki: you should make a version that has jquery 1.7.2 and jquery ui 1.8.18 and if the error persists, file it to http://bugs.jqueryui.com
[11:33:52] <tasuki> ajpiano, thanks, will do
[11:34:35] <gnarf> tasuki: i believe i fixed that bug in 1.8.17
[11:34:42] <fission6> .html() seems to only give me html for the first selected element, how do i get it for all
[11:35:04] <gnarf> tasuki: but if not - i KNOW i fixed it in master
[11:35:19] <feyd> does anyone have any problems with IE not loading values fast enough from a .load() handler?
[11:35:27] <tasuki> gnarf, keywords to look for in the commit message? :)
[11:35:31] <mszola> gnarf--have you worked with dialog?
[11:36:56] <gnarf> tasuki: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/e8ba367a58995b191706e5682eacba534cd25697 -- in 1.9
[11:36:58] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by gnarf37 (5m, 3w ago): Effects: fixing an animateClass issue when the class was empty
[11:37:30] <tasuki> gnarf, thanks a bunch both for your fix and for all the info!
[11:38:28] <gnarf> i don't think that was backported onto 1.8 stable
[11:39:20] <gnarf> but the same fix should apply on 1.8
[11:39:59] <gnarf> the issue is .attr( "class" ) doesn't return "" for no classes in 1.6+
[11:41:57] <ctk> anyone have a link to the article ben alman wrote about jquery plugin patterns? i can't find it
[11:42:21] <gnarf> tasuki: its not fixed in 1.8
[11:42:28] <gnarf> tasuki: did you file a bug?
[11:42:42] <gnarf> tasuki: if you would, and send me a link to the ticket, ill push a fix for the next release
[11:43:15] <haizum> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9895608/infinite-scroll-on-function-trouble
[11:43:20] <haizum> here's one for you guys... i'm stumped
[11:43:32] <tasuki> gnarf, when you fixed it in master, isn't it automatically going to be included in the next release?
[11:44:17] <haizum> gnarf: progress has been made, but check the link and you can see what's happening now :/
[11:52:12] <gnarf> tasuki: master = 1.9, not 1.8
[11:53:22] <gnarf> haizum: are you "re attaching" that $(document).on ?
[11:53:40] <gnarf> haizum: you should only need to bind that event once
[11:53:48] <gnarf> it should work even on the new ones
[11:54:36] <haizum> so put it inside its own .js and call it in the document header so its only executed once?
[11:54:55] <haizum> right now its embedded in a flow of js, not within its own function call
[11:55:01] <haizum> perhaps that's why?
[11:57:53] <haizum> not sure i'm following u
[12:02:12] <xenaxon> hi, how to preload an image?
[12:02:44] <evasivx> xenaxon, with css background and visibility:hidden; !
[12:02:45] <evasivx> :P
[12:03:42] <besimo> 		$.fn.preload = function() {
[12:03:42] <besimo> 		    this.each(function(){
[12:03:42] <besimo> 		        $('<img/>')[0].src = this;
[12:03:42] <besimo> 		    });
[12:03:42] <besimo> 		}
[12:05:43] <besimo> and calling it with e.g.

[12:08:42] <xenaxon> besimo: could there be any problems?
[12:10:47] <besimo> if they are large, then they are large :D
[12:12:38] <EdwardIII> ho hum
[12:13:19] <besimo> there shouldn't be any problems preloading large images
[12:13:21] <EdwardIII> for some reason, when i click on one of the type=submit buttons, it's getting executed 3 times: https://gist.github.com/2219347

[12:16:48] <haizum> gnarf: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9895608/infinite-scroll-on-function-trouble
[12:16:54] <haizum> gnarf: some dude solved it for me :)
[12:17:01] <haizum> woo
[12:17:54] <minna> some dudes are nice
[12:19:15] <haizum> indeed :)
[12:19:20] <haizum> i've been at this for two days now
[12:19:46] <haizum> i feel like a beer lol
[12:24:08] <tash> anyone used .load() much?
[12:25:10] <feyd> tash: I'm using it in something and having problems in IE because of it, hey will you help me with that great thanks
[12:27:05] <gyaresu> I'm completely failing to get a twitter javascript snippet to act on anything but the first of multiple Google Maps infoWindows.
[12:28:11] <gyaresu> Because infoWindows are getting added to the dom after clicking, what's a way I can bind something like $('.twitter-share-button').something('event', function { _do_snippet_ };
[12:28:15] <rroelofs> tash: what do you get when you past that url into your browser?
[12:28:26] <tash> feyd: I wish I could, I'm a newb :)
[12:28:33] <feyd> bah
[12:28:33] <Eviltwin> gyaresu: Take advantage of event delegation
[12:28:39] <Eviltwin> gyaresu: see ?.on
[12:28:41] <bot-t> gyaresu, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:28:45] <Eviltwin> Read the part about event delegation
[12:28:51] <ctk> anyone use bxSlider and try to add a new slide to the slider?
[12:28:56] <ctk> dynamically
[12:29:15] <gyaresu> Yeah, I've been reading about .on & .delegate but what's the 'event'?
[12:29:44] <Eviltwin> gyaresu: Things like clicking, mousing over, etc
[12:29:54] <Eviltwin> Look at the examples on the api.jquery.com page
[12:30:18] <gyaresu> Eviltwin: Yeah but that's not what's happening with a Google maps infoWindow
[12:30:45] <Eviltwin> Then you're going to have to refer to their examples
[12:31:35] <gyaresu> Eviltwin: Thanks, but it's been a few days now on this and the manual doesn't help. The only question on SO was one that I answered for a guy with a similar problem.
[12:31:52] <gyaresu> I'll post a link to my dev  code.
[12:33:33] <jholloman> Does anyone know of a good method to print an embeded pdf?
[12:35:29] <gyaresu> In case anyone's feeling in the mood to solve what might be a simple problem: http://oslogigs-dev.appspot.com/mobile
[12:36:16] <ctk> anyone have experience with bxSlider? I'm trying to dynamically add new divs to the slider, but can't get it to work
[12:36:48] <tash> rroelofs: I have managed to break something else so I don't know yet :)
[12:37:27] <gyaresu> The tweet button javascript will work on the first map infoWindow but not on any others. No matter whether I put the google.maps.event.addListener inside or outside the $.each or $.getJSON
[12:41:45] <feyd> is .find(':checkbox') equal to .find('input[type="checkbox"])
[12:42:41] <mr_pinc> Anyone familiar with the jParallax plugin?
[12:44:17] <Eviltwin> feyd: The latter is faster, I believe
[12:45:01] <feyd> Eviltwin: that's what I thought, but I see :checkbox a lot around stackoverflow, so it's confusing. It's shorter, so there's that
[12:45:49] <rroelofs> feyd: Usually programmer productivity outweighs micro-optimisation.  :checkbox is easier to type and remember
[12:46:11] <Eviltwin> feyd: It's also probably getting deprecated in jQuery 1.8
[12:46:29] <feyd> Eviltwin: probably for the best, css selectors are a lot more consistent
[12:55:21] <DukeDrake> how can I select every 'visible' row of a table?
[12:57:27] <feyd> ok I'm trying to get these checkboxes to act like a combo of radio buttons and checkboxes. When you click one, they all uncheck (have that working), but when you click a checked checkbox, it unchecks. I can't get the 2nd part of that working. Here's my example, which has them behaving like radio buttons. How can I get them to uncheck when clicking a checked one? http://jsfiddle.net/sAykv/
[13:02:22] <feyd> I already know how silly it is to make checkboxes work like radio buttons, but unfortunately, this is the lesser of the two evils
[13:03:00] <feyd> Better wording: I have checkboxes, I only allow 1 checked at a time. I also want to be able to uncheck the selected one without checking another one. How can I accomplish this? Here's an example: Better wording: I
[13:03:20] <feyd> thats a terrible example, heres a real one: http://jsfiddle.net/sAykv/ - ill stop talking now
[13:07:37] <rroelofs> feyd: do the actual boxes have different names or some way to identify them?
[13:07:59] <rroelofs> bsically you wante $(":checkbox:not(me)")
[13:09:53] <feyd> rroelofs: think of it like a radio button list that you can uncheck if you wanted
[13:10:09] <feyd> rroelofs: you can only have 1 active at any time, but you can also disable that one if you want and have none
[13:12:39] <feyd> rroelofs: I thought it would just be something like if(this is checked) uncheck, otherwise do what I had already
[13:12:48] <feyd> but that wouldn't work now matter how i tried it
[13:13:00] <Porpado> will an input element with display: none be submit?
[13:13:17] <Eviltwin> Porpado: Believe so, yes
[13:14:02] <eworbit> I'm having a hard time accessing the contents of a text input field
[13:14:09] <eworbit> $("div").find("input").each(function() {  alert(this.value);  });
[13:14:27] <eworbit> the alert box is alway empty, even when I type in the input fields
[13:14:48] <Eviltwin> First, see ?alert
[13:14:48] <bot-t> First, Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[13:14:55] <RandalSchwartz> maybe $(this).value()
[13:14:59] <feyd> eworbit: try $('div').find('input').each(function() { alert($(this).val() });
[13:15:05] <RandalSchwartz> .val() I mean
[13:15:08] <RandalSchwartz> yeah
[13:15:15] <eworbit> same result
[13:15:20] <eworbit> I tried both
[13:15:32] <feyd> throw it in a fiddle
[13:15:35] <RandalSchwartz> are you sure your input is in a div. :)
[13:15:56] <eworbit> yes, it's in the right context
[13:16:16] <eworbit> I can actually to this: $(this).replaceWith($("<p />").text(this.value));
[13:16:28] <feyd> eworbit: chances are theres something else we cant see interfering, if you put your markup and JS in a jsfiddle.net, we can check everything
[13:16:29] <eworbit> but the contents of the paragraph is empty
[13:16:33] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/R4pUJ/
[13:17:10] <eworbit> will do
[13:19:14] <eworbit> actually, I'm using jqueryUI draggable as well as a input watermark.
[13:19:24] <eworbit> so I can set up a good example
[13:19:27] <eworbit> can't
[13:19:48] <Eviltwin> eworbit: We're not asking you to rebuild your entire site in the fiddle
[13:20:00] <Eviltwin> We're asking you to show that exactly what you described as not working isn't working
[13:20:03] <Eviltwin> The specific issue
[13:20:05] <Eviltwin> Isolate it and reproduce
[13:20:39] <eworbit> right,  but I'll need to play around with fiddle.   Is that something you can see in real-time also?
[13:21:07] <Eviltwin> You can click "Run" and the code will be run in the "Result" box
[13:21:35] <haizum> hmm, i've got infinite scroll + masonry working great together now, except that i can't seem to remove the gap of about 50px that's showing between each page
[13:21:45] <kinginky> im having some problems with jquery + socket.io. .unload() doesnt fire (and actually now is firing on page load)
[13:21:47] <kinginky> http://pastebin.com/Qf5JdV7x
[13:22:06] <haizum> i've tried everything, removing margins, padding, etc. from the elements but it seems to be there because of either infinish scroll or masonry, not sure
[13:22:16] <haizum> infinish=infinite oops
[13:22:20] <rroelofs> feyd: the problem you are running into is that the checked state isn't set yet when the event handler is called
[13:22:34] <Eviltwin> kinginky: There's a difference between referring to a function and running a function
[13:22:42] <Eviltwin> You are doing the latter and want the former at line 47
[13:22:52] <kinginky> ah, i see
[13:22:54] <kinginky> let me try that
[13:24:17] <kinginky> Eviltwin: i fixed that, but it's still not firing on page close
[13:24:35] <Eviltwin> That's because the document doesn't have an unload event, the window does
[13:24:39] <eworbit> ah...... $(this).val() and this.value both work.    It is an issue with the watermark pluggin that is somehow causing an input value to be deleted.
[13:25:03] <velocitykendal> I'm trying to use the cookie plugin with UI Tabs...
[13:25:04] <Eviltwin> eworbit: This is why we make people isolate
[13:25:09] <feyd> rroelofs: is there any other method I can use that can handle what i'm trying to do?
[13:25:28] <velocitykendal> e.g. ( ".selector" ).tabs({ cookie: { expires: 1 }});
[13:25:40] <velocitykendal> but the cookie doesn't seem to be working
[13:25:50] <velocitykendal> can anyone think of a way I can test it?
[13:25:57] <kinginky> Eviltwin: same result with $(window).unload()
[13:26:07] <kinginky> same lack of result*
[13:26:09] <eworbit> eviltwin:  confusing since the form submission posts the variable just fine.   The watermark plugin must be injecting the value at the last moment.   thanks.
[13:26:42] <Eviltwin> kinginky: http://jsfiddle.net/Aw45E/
[13:27:24] <Eviltwin> eworbit: And that's exactly why we isolate. Just because the before and after are what you expect, doesn't mean the in between is
[13:27:25] <kinginky> i will paste this exact snippet in and run it
[13:31:16] <kinginky> eviltwin: it's working now, thank you.
[13:31:47] <fission6> how can i remove classes from a selection and all its descdants
[13:32:22] <Eviltwin> Do you mean how can you remove all elements with a particular class and all elements descending from those elements?
[13:34:17] <Eviltwin> fission6?
[13:35:52] <_helpPlz_> feyd: http://jsfiddle.net/sAykv/1/ would do?
[13:38:01] <feyd> _helpPlz_: ....yes...thats perfect. I love you.
[13:38:42] <devkinetic> if i do var obj = $(this); what would be the correct syntax for selecting the equivilent of:   obj.('.cal-items div'):last.remove ?
[13:39:12] <rroelofs> feyd: even simpler...box.parent().find(':checkbox:checked').not(this).prop('checked', false);
[13:39:34] <eworbit> it would be nice if jsfiddle.net had something like http://www.commandlinefu.com
[13:39:40] <Eviltwin> devkinetic: Instead of writing syntax, why don't you describe what you're looking for using terms like "children" and "descendents"
[13:39:56] <eworbit> that way you experts can slicken up some tight jquery for us newbies to see
[13:40:33] <feyd> rroelofs: also thank you, that is precisely what I needed as wel
[13:40:45] <rroelofs> sorry it took me so long
[13:41:12] <rroelofs> I was trying to do too much and it wasn't working
[13:41:19] <devkinetic> My plugins container element is defined like this:  var obj = $(this);
[13:41:49] <Eviltwin> Okay, from obj
[13:41:51] <feyd> rroelofs: not a problem, I appreciate your help
[13:41:54] <Eviltwin> Describe what you're trying to select
[13:41:57] <devkinetic> i would like to select the child div .cal-items and then remove the last div within it
[13:42:09] <Eviltwin> Child or descendant?
[13:42:13] <Eviltwin> Can it be a child of a child?
[13:42:21] <devkinetic> sorry, i forgot this client doesn't allow me to do line breaks
[13:44:14] <devkinetic> im not sure exactly the right terminology my html is like (div#container (child div.cal-items (slideshow divs))) and obj is equal to div#container
[13:44:50] <Eviltwin> Okay, so if I have <div><p><span></span></p></div>
[13:45:03] <Eviltwin> The p is a child of div but the span is not a child of div
[13:45:16] <Eviltwin> It is however a descendent
[13:45:38] <Eviltwin> Meaning it's somewhere inside that div
[13:46:28] <devkinetic> the div i would like to select is a decendent of obj and a child of .cal-items
[13:48:30] <devkinetic> i could easily do $('#container .cal-items div'), but im using obj = $(this) for #container and i know obj.('.cal-items div') is wrong

[13:51:16] <fission6> how can i remove classes from a selection and all its descdants
[13:52:22] <Eviltwin> fission6: Dude
[13:52:32] <Eviltwin> fission6: Asked you a followup
[13:52:34] <Eviltwin> You didn't answer
[13:52:49] <fission6> sorry
[13:52:54] <fission6> missed that got into the zone, my b
[13:53:00] <fission6> Eviltwin: what was the follow up, sorry
[13:53:12] <Eviltwin> Do you mean how can you remove all elements with a particular class and all elements descending from those elements?
[13:53:25] <Eviltwin> Or are you trying to actually unset those classes?
[13:54:01] <fission6> the later, i am selecting a <div> from ajax repsonse, and want to remove all formatting within that div and its children
[13:54:22] <Eviltwin> So all classes or specific classes?
[13:55:58] <Eviltwin> fission6: All classes or specific classes?
[13:56:19] <FunnyLookinHat> With jQueryUI's sortable - is there a way to add a class to the object that is being dragged active? I'm not seeing it as one of the options for .sortable()
[13:56:59] <Eviltwin> FunnyLookinHat: Maybe it's a draggable setting
[13:57:00] <ajpiano> FunnyLookinHat: you can just add it yourself using the callbacks
[13:57:13] <FunnyLookinHat> ajpiano, ah right - good call.
[13:57:51] <fission6> Eviltwin: let me think
[13:58:36] <c00kiemon5ter> hi all,
[13:59:05] <c00kiemon5ter> do you know of any widget-thing that would tell how many users are viewing the page atm ?
[13:59:49] <c00kiemon5ter> users/visitors
[14:00:10] <Eviltwin> c00kiemon5ter: Well it would definitely require some server-side logic
[14:00:24] <Eviltwin> I don't know if there are any free services for that
[14:01:08] <FunnyLookinHat> ajpiano, piece of cake with start and stop - thanks!

[14:27:11] <xp_prg2> anyone using the datatables jquery plugin?
[14:30:24] <BaruchHashem> can someone tell me why the style in this code wont execute: http://pastie.org/3680650
[14:30:37] <pajo> i have "fileChecker" checkbox inside a div and the div has this click function ( http://pastebin.com/0SraTKV0 ). everything works fine until i try to directly check the checkbox. the function then unchecks it again. How can i detet if the checkbox, inside the div, was clicked so i could terminate the function
[14:31:18] <oojacoboo> what's the best way to find if a child element is clicked within a parent with a click event attached?
[14:31:31] <oojacoboo> I'm going to do an if() return within the click event on the parent
[14:31:50] <oojacoboo> but I don't know what would be within the if, do I need to bind another event on that, or what?
[14:32:19] <someprimetime> you can
[14:32:27] <oojacoboo> well, I figured I could
[14:32:33] <oojacoboo> but I would rather not if there is a better way
[14:32:34] <someprimetime> $(child).click(yourFunction); inside your parent
[14:35:22] <ngharo> oojacoboo: events bubble.  <div id="foo"><div id="bar"></div></div> you have click() bound to foo, but click on bar.  foo's click handler still gets called
[14:35:47] <oojacoboo> ngharo: yes, I know
[14:36:12] <oojacoboo> so, the point is if bar is clicked within the event handler function for foo return
[14:36:19] <oojacoboo> prevent default as well
[14:36:24] <oojacoboo> then do my stuff
[14:36:30] <oojacoboo> but what is the IF ?
[14:37:13] <ravenzz> what does it means? bar is clicked within the event handler function for foo
[14:37:14] <ravenzz> ?
[14:37:28] <ravenzz> you trigger a click
[14:37:28] <ravenzz> ?
[14:37:52] <eworbit> anyone here for hire to finish up a jquery demonstration script?
[14:37:53] <oojacoboo> I'm sorry, can you please ask again in English?
[14:37:55] <ngharo> oojacoboo: you can prevent bar click from bubbling, see ?event.stopPropagation
[14:37:55] <bot-t> oojacoboo, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[14:37:58] <oojacoboo> I'm not following ravenzz
[14:37:59] <ngharo> does that help
[14:38:35] <ravenzz> oojacoboo sorry my english is no that good. I meant, are you trying to do this $(foo).click(function(){ $(bar).click() }); ?
[14:38:42] <oojacoboo> ravenzz: yes
[14:38:51] <oojacoboo> I mean, ngharo ^^
[14:39:35] <oojacoboo> ngharo: that still requires me to define each click event within the parent
[14:39:37] <ravenzz> k if you need both stopPropagation and preventDefault
[14:39:41] <ravenzz> return false
[14:39:54] <mikkelb> Eviltwin: u around?
[14:40:05] <mikkelb> Eviltwin: just wanted to make sure u got my mail
[14:40:51] <ngharo> oojacoboo: it does?  i dont really follow what you're trying to accomplish sorry
[14:41:45] <oojacoboo> ngharo: I was hoping for somethign like…   if the event exists on $(this).find("a") return
[14:42:24] <zelrik> hi
[14:42:46] <zelrik> Does .appendTo includes any string before a tag?
[14:43:25] <zelrik> like $("Foo<div id=...").appendTo("#Stuff")
[14:43:46] <zelrik> Foo is not appended
[14:43:49] <zelrik> in my code
[14:43:59] <rroelofs> I wouldn't expect it to
[14:44:04] <zelrik> :(
[14:44:05] <zelrik> whyyy
[14:44:17] <rroelofs> jQuery will try to make a selector out of  the string you pass in
[14:44:20] <zelrik> Such a cruel world
[14:44:23] <velocitykendal> Hi, can anyone help me debug the cookie plugin with UI Tabs?
[14:44:31] <ngharo> oojacoboo: exists as in "was triggered on" ?
[14:44:43] <ngharo> oojacoboo: http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/XRUAa/1/
[14:44:43] <zelrik> rroelofs: how to work around that issue?
[14:45:12] <rroelofs> zelrik: $("#Stuff").append("blah")
[14:45:13] <velocitykendal> $( ".selector" ).tabs({ cookie: { expires: 1 }});
[14:45:19] <velocitykendal> ...doesn't seem to work at all
[14:45:36] <zelrik> rroelofs: but isnt is the same...
[14:45:40] <zelrik> it*
[14:45:43] <rroelofs> nope
[14:45:55] <zelrik> ok I ll do that
[14:46:33] <rroelofs> zelrik: jQuery can take many kinds of arguments.  It guesses what you want by what you pass in.
[14:47:04] <rroelofs> zelrik: if first character is < it guesses you are making html
[14:48:14] <zelrik> oh
[14:48:19] <zelrik> finally a result that makes sense
[14:48:22] <zelrik> thanks rroelofs
[14:49:49] <wycks> is there a built in way to detect a key "hold" without using a timer
[15:05:44] <Jon47> wycks - events are fired for keydown and keyup
[15:06:07] <wycks> ya thanks that is what im doing
[15:06:18] <Jon47> but i think you'd need to use a timer to figure out whether the keyup followed it
[15:06:33] <wycks> oh bummer
[15:06:37] <jtomasrl> how can i make a DOM draggable inside an specific area?
[15:07:18] <oojacoboo> ?draggable

[15:07:23] <Jon47> what's wrong with timers
[15:07:29] <oojacoboo> jtomasrl: ^^
[15:08:00] <jtomasrl> i know how to make things draggable, but that works inside the whole window, i need it to be only inside a certain div

[15:15:39] <Jon47> wycks: actually you don't need a timer, just do soemthing like this: http://jsfiddle.net/EsGKB/
[15:18:07] <wycks> Jon47 ah perfect how does one add a specific key to the keydown, for example ive been using e.shiftKey
[15:19:08] <Jon47> wycks - jquery normalizes the keycode into a var, i forget the property though, something like e.keyCode or e.which, so then in the event handler you would check the event's keycode and if it matches what you're looking for you, then you run your script
[15:19:17] <gnarf> which
[15:20:16] <Jon47> and if you're using jquery ui you can compare it to the slightly more readable stuff in $.ui.keyCode
[15:21:44] <fission6> is there a clean way to wrap text currently selected with tags?
[15:21:51] <wycks> ya seems like there are several ways to do thhis
[15:26:18] <wycks> works with e.keyCode
[15:27:17] <ihdev> how do I run a js loop until a button is clicked?
[15:27:32] <Jon47> wycks: that may not be compatible with all browsers, see http://api.jquery.com/event.which/
[15:27:50] <wycks> was just about to ask that ^
[15:27:50] <quuxman> How do you give something a display of none by default, but with a more specific selector make the display what it should be, based on other CSS rules and default behaviorA?
[15:27:57] <Jon47> ihdev setInterval and clearInterval

[15:28:56] <ihdev> Jon47 ty
[15:29:07] <Jon47> np
[15:30:05] <quuxman> and yes, this is totally a CSS question, and not a jquery question
[15:33:45] <Lonestar99> good evening
[15:34:49] <ortix> hi guys, i'm going to troll my site on april 1st, and I need to replace EVERY string on the site with "pudi pudi pudi pudi"
[15:34:59] <ortix> how would i go about doing that?
[15:35:03] <Lonestar99> that is the best way most efficient -->  to remove "http://" || "https://"  from "http://www.fooboo.com ??
[15:35:07] <ortix> i can only search and match
[15:37:03] <Eviltwin> $("*").each(function(){if(!this.firstChild && this.textContent) this.textContent = "pudi pudi pudi pudi"; });
[15:37:51] <Eviltwin> Actually that won't quite work
[15:38:47] <Eviltwin> This will though: $("*").each(function(){ var $this = $(this); if($this.children().length == 0 && $this.text()) $this.text("pudi pudi pudi pudi"); });
[15:40:51] <ortix> Thanks Eviltwin ! :D
[15:43:34] <feyd> so I'm building a quote form and I'm doing a bunch of decimal value operations depending on form actions. I have an issue though, as many of the values turn to NaN when things re-calculate. I have my code in a working example here: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10868783/quote/index.html - can anyone see what's causing it? All my calculations are done in priceCalculate()
[15:43:49] <JavaLover> hi i'm curious, i have a hover function
[15:43:55] <Eviltwin> feyd: You're probably trying to divide by a string or something like that
[15:44:02] <JavaLover> but the hover shows a div that is outside the object i'm hovering
[15:44:21] <JavaLover> i want hovering to stay until i go outside of both the thing revealed & the initial div
[15:44:31] <feyd> Eviltwin: that sounds right, I was playing around with parseFloat, is that what I want to use? I don't want to convert to an Int, and in VB.NET I have CDec to convert to decimals, what can I do in JS?
[15:45:09] <Eviltwin> What I would suggest doing is something like function c(x) { if(isNaN(x)) throw "hit NaN"; return x; }
[15:45:20] <Eviltwin> And wrap some of your calculations / parses in c(...)
[15:45:27] <Eviltwin> To figure out where it's happening
[15:45:29] <Lonestar99> anyone know how to remove protocol using jquery?
[15:45:32] <Eviltwin> Then remove that once you stort it out
[15:46:38] <feyd> Eviltwin: I will do just that, thanks for the suggestion
[15:47:26] <JavaLover> so my question now?
[15:47:50] <JavaLover> I have a hover function basically it reveals a div outside the bounding box, i want that div to remain seen but I think somehow i'm coming off the initial bounding box
[15:47:58] <Eviltwin> JavaLover: I suggest you look at mousein and mouseout
[15:48:14] <Eviltwin> Or mouseenter and mouseleave
[15:48:27] <Eviltwin> They have slightly different behaviors
[15:51:50] <Zzaichik> That would be cool if hover could handle two functions, one for mousenter and one for mouseleave.
[15:52:25] <oojacoboo> Zzaichik: yea, but those are two different events
[15:52:34] <oojacoboo> why group them?
[15:53:41] <Zzaichik> well, if you could do something similar with .hover()
[15:53:50] <Zzaichik> you follow me?
[15:54:15] <oojacoboo> Zzaichik: http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/   like that?
[15:54:31] <oojacoboo> and this… http://api.jquery.com/mouseout/
[15:55:17] <gnarf> Zzaichik: hover( mouseenter, mouseleave ) is in the api....
[15:55:27] <gnarf> ?hover
[15:55:27] <bot-t> .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[15:55:40] <gnarf> if you only pass one it binds to both
[15:56:04] <Zzaichik> something like this; http://jsfiddle.net/ZzaichikK/Gf9Ct/
[15:56:19] <ortix> Eviltwin: I tried out the puddi script but it didn't work :(
[15:56:24] <ortix> the second one you sent me
[15:56:31] <gnarf> Zzaichik: $('element').hover(function() { $(this).toggleClass("over"); });
[15:56:46] <Zzaichik> what the.. I didn't think you could do that!
[15:56:51] <ortix> firebug tells me that $this.children is not a function
[15:56:54] <Zzaichik> Well I learned something today.
[15:57:15] <Zzaichik> My example is poor.
[15:57:31] <gnarf> the code you pasted works fine too tho
[15:58:00] <Lonestar99> answer -->  var surl = elem.showurl.replace(/^http:\/\//i, '');
[15:58:00] <Zzaichik> does it? I didn't think that would work.
[15:58:10] <gnarf> Zzaichik: yeah - it works
[15:58:20] <gnarf> ?hover @Zzaichik
[15:58:20] <bot-t> Zzaichik, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[15:58:47] <gnarf> if you only pass one handler, it binds to both enter and leave
[16:00:13] <Zzaichik> huh.. that's good to know
[16:00:16] <Zzaichik> lol
[16:01:53] <Zzaichik> I'll be damned. I totally thought that wouldn't work.
[16:03:12] <raj> Eviltwin, sorry about yesterday
[16:03:36] <raj> i ran away in the middle of your explanation
[16:10:37] <shoky> how's your friend?
[16:11:13] <imsky> awww tuesday
[16:11:13] <bot-t> (24 hours 40 mins ago) <abjorn> tell imsky he should teleport to austin and go out drinking with me
[16:11:26] <raj> shoky, he's okay, thanks for asking :)
[16:11:32] <shoky> good!
[16:11:41] <shoky> how's your appy
[16:11:50] <raj> exactly where I was yesterday
[16:11:56] <shoky> ;D
[16:12:08] <raj> cuz when I put that Dog/Cat code into production, the X doesn't work
[16:12:18] <raj> since it's being dynamically created
[16:12:34] <shoky> my code?
[16:12:41] <shoky> i mean for the X
[16:12:54] <raj> well, ur code works fine
[16:13:05] <raj> but basically, when the page is loaded, i look up what the previous sort selections were
[16:13:21] <raj> and try recreating the sort boxes as they looked before the page refresh
[16:13:23] <ortix> i guess eviltwin is gone or something so i'll state my question again if that's ok
[16:13:26] <shoky> ah
[16:13:36] <ortix> I'm trying to replace EVERY string on my site with "puddi puddi" as an april fools joke
[16:13:37] <raj> but in doing so, those dynamically created X's don't react
[16:13:42] <ortix> ideas?
[16:13:44] <raj> not sure how all the other stuff still works though
[16:14:04] <shoky> hmm i guess they need the .click event binded
[16:14:14] <raj> like selecting an option still causes the normal stuff to happen
[16:14:30] <raj> i dunno what's special about the X that it doesn't
[16:15:08] <shoky> in my code i wrote: $('.sort_form a').click( onX );
[16:15:12] <shoky> at startup
[16:15:21] <shoky> which binded the first X to the onX handler
[16:15:38] <shoky> so you'd need to do the same to the X's you dynamically put there
[16:16:30] <shoky> that's why i didn't just make an anonymous click handler, so you can bind to it at your pleasure
[16:17:18] <raj> oh, u know what, I changed that line to $(document).on('click', '.sort_form>a', onX); and it sorta works more
[16:17:25] <raj> like it actually removes the item
[16:17:29] <shoky> or you could just delegate the click handling to the container element which is a better solution, i guess
[16:17:37] <raj> but the ordinals all say NaN
[16:17:54] <shoky> ah you delegated ;p
[16:18:32] <shoky> mm i donno, could take a look if you want
[16:18:42] <raj> shoky, does that change $(this)?
[16:18:53] <shoky> inside onX ?
[16:18:56] <raj> yeah
[16:19:01] <shoky> hmm could be yeah
[16:19:14] <shoky> you'd need $(event.target) i think
[16:19:18] <shoky> instead of $(this)
[16:19:32] <shoky> not positive tho
[16:19:43] <raj> dunno, that didn't solve it
[16:20:00] <raj> it's funny, it makes every ordinal NaN after the removed box
[16:21:38] <raj> well, this is how I'm trying to recreate the sortboxes http://jsfiddle.net/UStcW/
[16:22:30] <raj> and that works fine
[16:23:52] <raj> console.log for $(event.target) is [<a>X</a>] btw
[16:23:57] <raj> seems right
[16:25:24] <dogarrhea2> are trailing commas in the data passed into an ajax call errornous?
[16:26:36] <raj> aah, shoky, I believe the issue is I didn't set the precedence data
[16:26:40] <raj> when I recreated the boxes
[16:27:06] <raj> so the precedence in `p = precedence + i` is undefined
[16:27:56] <ddoom> is it possible to set values in html (not js) that can be read using jquery's .data function?
[16:28:46] <raj> ddoom, yes, just make a data attribute
[16:28:55] <shoky> raj so it works ok?
[16:29:20] <shoky> that works?
[16:29:28] <shoky> i mean what you answered to ddoom
[16:30:05] <shoky> well i mean both.
[16:30:57] <raj> afaik it works
[16:31:18] <raj> <a data-test="hello">hi</a>
[16:31:29] <shoky> yeah but he asked if it can be read using .data()
[16:31:30] <raj> .data('test')
[16:31:32] <shoky> not .attr
[16:31:42] <raj> oh, maybe I misread the specs
[16:31:49] <shoky> mm lets see
[16:32:10] <ddoom> raj, shoky: I justed tested setting it using html and reading it using .data() and it works
[16:32:53] <shoky> cool, kinda
[16:33:03] <shoky> i think i'd rather have it not work though
[16:33:18] <raj> haha
[16:33:22] <raj> just for consistency
[16:33:32] <raj> since it doesn't actually set the data attribute
[16:33:46] <shoky> ?data
[16:33:46] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[16:33:58] <shoky> yah it's just supposed to be associated with a dom element
[16:34:20] <shoky> don't see why html attributes should have any affect on that
[16:34:25] <raj> i would just prefer that data actually set the data attribut
[16:34:26] <raj> e
[16:34:40] <shoky> well thats just .attr('data',...)
[16:34:46] <raj> ya
[16:34:48] <shoky> or maybe i donno what you mean
[16:38:25] <imsky> i'm a little teapot
[16:38:28] <imsky> short and stout
[16:38:39] <shoky> who's your daddy
[16:39:22] <imsky> lol
[16:39:53] <raj> shoky, got it all working now with the ordinals
[16:40:06] <shoky> ;)
[16:40:11] <raj> had forgotten about that precedence data
[16:40:19] <jtomasrl> whats wrong with this... i need to display the start position relative to a div but i get "undefined"
[16:40:20] <jtomasrl> https://gist.github.com/2221540
[16:40:26] <raj> btw, everytime X is clicked, my menu closes
[16:40:29] <raj> any idea why that might be?
[16:40:36] <raj> it .hides()
[16:40:42] <shoky> what menu?
[16:41:08] <shoky> and mm the onX code isn't too nice, it makes lotsa assumptions about the order of the elements
[16:41:16] <shoky> maybe that has smth to do with it donno
[16:41:28] <raj> http://jsfiddle.net/UStcW/1/
[16:41:57] <raj> it's somehow registering it as a clickoutside?
[16:41:59] <shoky> jtomasrl fiddle it
[16:42:23] <shoky> raj where's all the code?
[16:42:25] <dogarrhea2> jtomsrlfiddle?
[16:42:29] <dogarrhea2> what the hell is that
[16:42:34] <jtomasrl> fiddle?
[16:42:47] <dogarrhea2> oh
[16:42:54] <jtomasrl> oh i get it
[16:43:02] <dogarrhea2> i thought jtomasrl fiddle was a new jsfiddle like site lolol
[16:43:07] <raj> shoky, oh, I just pasted this portion to show you the only situation that should cause it to hide
[16:43:14] <shoky> oh
[16:43:30] <shoky> but i dont see any menu
[16:43:33] <raj> i'm just gonna put an alert in there and see if it's called when X is pressed
[16:43:38] <raj> .menu
[16:43:41] <shoky> ohh
[16:43:51] <shoky> nothing happens when i click on it
[16:44:03] <raj> clickoutside
[16:44:22] <shoky> huh
[16:44:26] <shoky> what's clickoutside
[16:44:35] <shoky> nothing happens no matter where i click ;p
[16:44:39] <raj> yes, it hits clickoutside
[16:44:52] <shoky> i am confused.
[16:44:59] <jtomasrl> http://jsfiddle.net/UStcW/1/
[16:45:06] <raj> jquery.ba-outside-events.min.js
[16:45:15] <shoky> jtomasrl you jus pasted raj's link..
[16:45:22] <raj> haha
[16:45:36] <jtomasrl> (:
[16:45:39] <raj> shoky, http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[16:45:43] <shoky> raj i am still confused. what is this  $('.sort_box').bind('clickoutside', function(e){
[16:45:55] <jtomasrl> sorry first time doing this
[16:46:13] <shoky> pasting? :p
[16:46:16] <raj> that way, it's easy to say bind clicking of anything else
[16:46:21] <jtomasrl> http://jsfiddle.net/3gzYS/
[16:46:57] <shoky> raj so you .menu is hiding instead of just .sort_form ?
[16:47:10] <raj> well, it shouldn't hide at all just cuz X is clicked
[16:47:18] <raj> since it's all within .menu and .sort_form
[16:47:48] <shoky> but you binded that clickoutside thing.. so why wouldn't it run?
[16:48:04] <b-lew> anyone know much about fancy box?
[16:48:09] <raj> cuz I haven't clicked outside .sort_box
[16:48:22] <shoky> oh i see
[16:48:23] <raj> .menu and .sort_form are within, just as the <a>X</a> is
[16:48:50] <shoky> well i donno much bout that clickoutside
[16:49:04] <shoky> i guess 'outside' has a specific meaning?
[16:49:24] <jtomasrl> can someone help me with this please: http://jsfiddle.net/3gzYS/4/
[16:49:48] <shoky> jtomasrl sure. what's the prob?
[16:50:14] <b-lew> anyone know much about fancy box? I'm trying to have a gallery with both images and videos
[16:50:19] <jtomasrl> shoky: i need to display the start position from the parent div or the startup div, but im getting undefined
[16:50:30] <Eviltwin> jtomasrl: Where'd you get this syntax from? $(this).position({ of: $("#startup") });
[16:50:45] <Eviltwin> ?position @ jtomasrl
[16:50:46] <bot-t> jtomasrl, .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[16:50:47] <jtomasrl> Eviltwin Jquery doc
[16:50:56] <Eviltwin> jtomasrl: You might also be interested in see ?offset
[16:50:57] <bot-t> jtomasrl, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[16:51:18] <Eviltwin> There is no syntax on the jQuery docs page that has { of: $("...") } in it
[16:51:38] <jtomasrl> im using this
[16:51:38] <jtomasrl> http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[16:52:15] <Eviltwin> Oh, this is jQuery UI stuff
[16:52:20] <Eviltwin> I'm not touching that
[16:53:01] <Eviltwin> Although I think my original concern still holes
[16:53:04] <Eviltwin> holds*
[16:53:10] <Eviltwin> I believe that's a setter, not a getter
[16:53:21] <Eviltwin> If you want to get the location of something, there's probably not going to be anything in the parens
[16:54:41] <jtomasrl> i need a position relative to something
[16:58:05] <shoky> jtomasrl first lets work with something that actually shows your problem: http://jsfiddle.net/3gzYS/5/
[16:58:50] <shoky> er containment doesn't need to be commented
[16:59:09] <b-lew> http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/HTML_NEW/index.html -> I'm trying to get both images and videos in a gallery if you click on portfolio then "BRIAN GUEHRING" you will see the gallery i'm trying to do that in...
[16:59:12] <shoky> well other than that yeah, what Eviltwin said
[17:00:30] <jtomasrl> shoky so how can i get the position relative to something, couse not everyone has the screen resolution i have so their position will be different
[17:00:53] <shoky> jtomasrl why not http://jsfiddle.net/3gzYS/6/
[17:01:35] <jtomasrl> shoky it works there but not when i add headers, menus, etc
[17:02:01] <jtomasrl> shoky and a main that depends on the user resolution using width in %
[17:03:14] <raj> Eviltwin, have you used clickoutside before?
[17:03:28] <shoky> if you want the position relative to its sibling , just calculate it..
[17:04:18] <shoky> raj can you fiddle up something that shows it happening?
[17:05:23] <raj> k, i'll try that
[17:06:59] <DrewAPicture_> Can somebody help with me with using a var has part of a selector?
[17:07:05] <shoky> ya
[17:07:29] <coldhead> should just be string concatenation, bro
[17:07:45] <coldhead> $('.' + classNameVar);
[17:07:47] <coldhead> or w/e
[17:07:50] <DrewAPicture_> coldhead: I've been messing with this for way too long.
[17:08:57] <DrewAPicture_> I've tranferred a php variable to a js var, then need to pinpoint a specific li id, e.g. ("#tabs li[id="+postid+"]")
[17:09:25] <DrewAPicture_> I have a very basic understanding of javascript really
[17:09:27] <tw2113> drew
[17:09:38] <DrewAPicture_> tw2113: Mike
[17:09:43] <shoky> then ask away..
[17:10:27] <coldhead> ("#tabs li#"+postid) should work
[17:10:32] <coldhead> but since IDs shoudl be unique
[17:10:42] <coldhead> $('#' + postid) should suffice
[17:10:44] <imsky> coldhead's about to commit suicide
[17:11:20] <DrewAPicture_> coldhead: I think that'll work. Thanks guys
[17:12:07] <shoky> [id=...] should work too though
[17:13:18] <DrewAPicture_> shoky: I tried [id="+postid+"] before and got nothing. li#+postid did the trick
[17:13:24] <jtomasrl> does position left return an integer?
[17:14:12] <raj> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/UStcW/6/
[17:14:47] <shoky> jtomasrl, # of pixels is usually an integer ;p
[17:15:09] <jtomasrl> shoky i can perform calculations with it, not + nor -
[17:15:16] <jtomasrl> shoky cant*
[17:15:19] <raj> dude, shoky, how are you new to jquery/js?
[17:15:21] <raj> amazing
[17:15:35] <shoky> wat??
[17:15:48] <shoky> jtomasrl sure you can
[17:16:11] <raj> cuz ur in here answering all sorts of questions, and I thought u said you've only recently picked up jquery and js
[17:16:19] <jtomasrl> shoky i get NaN
[17:16:19] <shoky> raj im not new to js, just had to get back into it in the past few weeks
[17:16:31] <raj> ah, gotcha
[17:16:32] <shoky> jtomasrl fiddle
[17:16:41] <shoky> well
[17:16:55] <shoky> i'm not new to programming or using differnet APIs
[17:17:32] <jtomasrl> shoky http://jsfiddle.net/3gzYS/7/
[17:17:35] <coldhead> shoky: [id=] should work but it gives jQuery a hernia
[17:20:00] <jtomasrl> shoky fixed
[17:20:46] <jtomasrl> a problem with parentheses
[17:21:10] <shoky> goody
[17:23:00] <shoky> raj, no idea ;SS
[17:23:10] <raj> shoot
[17:23:33] <shoky> shame, cause i was gonna say that i could use clickoutside in my work project :\
[17:24:03] <raj> i'm thinking it has something to do with binding the onX click to document
[17:24:47] <raj> actually, maybe not, cuz they do that in their example http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-outside-events/examples/clickoutside/
[17:25:34] <raj> prevent bubbling?
[17:26:26] <yuuki> hi... everyone
[17:26:48] <shadykhan> when using ajax load how can i specify in which div to load it in?
[17:27:08] <shadykhan> nvm im dumb got it
[17:27:09] <raj> shoky, yup, that did it
[17:27:18] <raj> e.stopPropagation()
[17:27:48] <yuuki> im having problem on the plugins that i found on google... my problem is on firefox it did work properly but on  google chrome it did not work properly
[17:29:22] <yuuki> and the error seems on this line  var top = (window_height - modal_height) / 2;         var left = (window_width - modal_width) / 2; firefox render this fine
[17:30:00] <yuuki> can anyone help me find a solution on my problem
[17:30:05] <theCole> yuuki: i am not a fan of under bars in js variable names
[17:30:15] <Renacor> $(document.parent).find('#sexy_iframe'); <— if I run this from an iframe, will it find an element with the id of sexy_iframe in the parent window?
[17:30:17] <theCole> yuuki: make a jsfiddle
[17:30:44] <theCole> Renacor: why don't you try it and see?
[17:30:55] <Renacor> theCole: it doesn't work
[17:30:59] <yuuki> theCole: thanks i did that already but on my pc i did not load properly
[17:31:20] <theCole> yuuki: use the console to look for javascript errors?
[17:31:31] <theCole> Renacor: then you have your answer =)
[17:31:50] <yuuki> theCole: on google i get same value on all my div but on firefox which is right is load each on diff value
[17:32:17] <yuuki> theCole: i did already check it but it did not show any error
[17:32:27] <JavaLover> ok so idk if anyone was here when I asked it
[17:32:30] <JavaLover> but i had a hover issue
[17:32:35] <theCole> yuuki: welcome to the world of x-browser
[17:32:39] <JavaLover> turns out, i had images in the way based on z-index
[17:32:42] <Renacor> how can I access an element in the parent window from within an iframe?
[17:32:46] <theCole> yuuki: i cannot really help you w/o an example
[17:32:49] <JavaLover> changed my z-index & now it works perfectly
[17:32:53] <JavaLover> oh man, what a crazy thing to fix, this is awesome now though
[17:32:56] <JavaLover> works like a charm
[17:32:57] <Renacor> or trigger an event in the parent window
[17:33:05] <yuuki> wait going to find way for you to see it
[17:33:46] <theCole> Renacor: not that I know of
[17:33:56] <theCole> you could use websockets
[17:35:43] <yuuki> theCole: here the link please see it on google and firefox thanks in advanceprodemosites.com/design/vintage/html/gallery_1.html
[17:36:05] <yuuki> theCole: here the link please see it on google and firefox thanks in advance prodemosites.com/design/vintage/html/gallery_1.html
[17:36:14] <yuuki> sorry for the repeat....
[17:37:18] <theCole> yuuki: is this your clothing line?
[17:37:23] <theCole> yuuki: or just a client
[17:37:51] <raj> shoky, can I pull the removal of selected options from each nextAll elements into a function...that way i can use it again when needed?
[17:37:51] <yuuki> that's my test server
[17:38:01] <yuuki> theCole: that's my test server
[17:38:13] <raj> (such as on page load, where I'm re-rendering the sortboxes from session)
[17:38:55] <raj> shoky, i'm actually not sure where in the code it does that
[17:40:11] <raj> oh, currSelect.find('option').each(function...
[17:46:59] <yuuki> theCole: let me know if you able to find the problem on the code i really need it  badly.... thank you sir theCole for your help.... :)
[17:48:13] <xinming_> How do we get the element name of $('#id-of-element') pleaese?
[17:48:48] <raj> $('#id-of-element').attr('name')
[17:52:55] <yuuki> xinming_:  how do you want the id of the element be get
[17:53:02] <yuuki> by click or hover
[17:53:45] <shoky> oops
[17:53:54] <yuuki> xinming_: you can try this $(this).attr('di');
[17:53:55] <shoky> raj i didnt get to read what u wrote :\
[17:54:20] <yuuki> xinming_: you can try this $(this).attr('id');
[17:54:50] <xinming_> yuuki: I don't mean the id, I mean the element name
[17:54:52] <xinming_> raj, Thanks.
[17:55:14] <raj> shoky, I wanted to abstract the portion of your code that assessed higher precedence selects so that options could be removed from lower precedence selects
[17:55:19] <raj> into a function
[17:55:24] <raj> cuz I need to reuse that portion
[17:55:29] <yuuki> xinming_:  like div, p, h1?
[17:55:56] <raj> yuuki, not the element type
[17:56:00] <raj> i think he wants the name attribute
[17:56:01] <shoky> hmm and how's that working out
[17:56:10] <yuuki> thanks raj
[17:56:13] <raj> shoky, it's not, I'm not sure what I need to cut out
[17:57:17] <shoky> hmm
[17:57:34] <raj> like, I'm not sure what portion I need to move into a function
[17:57:41] <raj> and replace with a function call
[17:58:04] <shoky> the joys of refactoring
[17:59:25] <yuuki> raj can you check what's wrong on my test server http://prodemosites.com/design/vintage/html/gallery_1.html it is working properly on firefox but on google it wont work like firefox can you help me
[18:03:17] <shoky> raj im not sure i understand what you wanna do
[18:03:30] <shoky> i mean, the part that 'assesses' higher precedence selects is just: $higher_precedence_elems = $this.prevAll('select'),
[18:03:43] <raj> i wanna abstract the portion of your code that removes used options (according to the values of higher precedence selects)
[18:06:08] <shadykhan> when using jquery load how can i make sure the page is fully loaded before displaying it?
[18:06:48] <yuuki> $(document).ready();
[18:07:18] <donCams> shadykhan: i think you need to monitor if all the images are loaded also
[18:08:24] <necros`> hi
[18:08:49] <shoky> raj and what's troubling you about doing that?
[18:09:38] <donCams> shadykhan: something like this? http://www.gayadesign.com/scripts/queryLoader/
[18:10:05] <raj> not sure from what line to what line I need to pull out
[18:10:19] <necros`> I'm searching for a way for inverting the order of years in jquery ui datepicker, can someone give me some help please?
[18:10:30] <raj> looks like it might just be the stuff in the else{}
[18:10:34] <raj> but not sure
[18:10:42] <shoky> well first define your new function and decide on what parameters it should have and what it does/returns
[18:11:10] <shoky> and for that you gotta figure out how you're gonna use that function
[18:11:38] <raj> I was hoping to just call the function and it would just do what it needed to do, without parameters
[18:11:51] <raj> cuz it's working on the same .sort_box as it currently is
[18:11:57] <raj> so nothing really needs to be different
[18:13:00] <raj> i just need to be able to call cleanupOptions() or whatever, when needed (as in, after loading the selects from session)
[18:13:28] <shoky> well it would have to know what the 'current' select box is
[18:14:51] <raj> oh, so it would need to be coded differently
[18:17:59] <raj> shoky, if I just used the first <select> for $(this) so that $lower_precedence_elems would be aggregated off that, would that do it?
[18:18:54] <shoky> not sure what ya mean
[18:23:35] <raj> shoky, I basically just want a cleanupOptions function that cleans up the options as the original function did, without all the extra stuff
[18:23:50] <raj> o that http://jsfiddle.net/hF9NP/ can work without a change the value of a select
[18:23:54] <raj> *so that
[18:26:13] <b-lew_>  http://2012.delineamultimedia.com/HTML_NEW/index.html -> If you click portfolio and then click on "BRIAN GUEHRING" the 3rd slide in should be the video but its blank... not for sure what to do to fix it. I'm using the fancy box gallery to have images and video
[18:29:27] <raj> shoky, sorry, this is more clear http://jsfiddle.net/hF9NP/2/
[18:29:50] <raj> i just want that function to remove the used up options from lower precedence elements
[18:30:10] <raj> I redefined $this as $("select[name='sortby_1']")
[18:30:24] <raj> but obv that didn't solve it :)
[18:30:28] <shoky> thats nasty ;p
[18:30:37] <shoky> sec
[18:31:39] <raj> nasty as in awesome, or nasty as in terrible?
[18:33:18] <shoky> well, $this shouldn't really ever point to anything but $(this) ;)
[18:33:21] <raj> i should probably paste the version that doesn't have syntax errors http://jsfiddle.net/hF9NP/5/
[18:33:24] <raj> :)
[18:33:45] <raj> oh crap
[18:33:47] <raj> it actually worked
[18:33:53] <raj> once I got rid of my errors
[18:34:03] <shoky> heh
[18:34:05] <raj> but yes, you're right, $this not being $(this) is nasty :)
[18:34:13] <b-lew_> Can I score some help?
[18:34:39] <haizum> anyone have any experience with infinite scroll? i'm using it with masonry and i can't get the ajax loader div to show up when scrolling to the next page for some reason
[18:34:53] <haizum> its setup exactly like the demo
[18:34:59] <haizum> but i see no loading animation
[18:35:22] <haizum> the div is set to display: none but i imagine thats only when its idle
[18:35:31] <shoky> b-lew_ what video?
[18:35:51] <raj> exactly
[18:35:52] <raj> :)
[18:36:39] <shoky> ;>
[18:37:04] <b-lew_> well its blank right now shaky
[18:37:11] <b-lew_> but I'm linking to a video
[18:37:24] <b-lew_> http://vimeo.com/24081323
[18:37:26] <shoky> then why is there a photo icon
[18:37:35] <b-lew_> in the source code it is in there
[18:37:50] <b-lew_> well i haven't photoshop'd one for this yet
[18:38:00] <b-lew_> just trying to get it to function right now
[18:38:24] <shoky> oh sry didnt realize you were asking about fancy box
[18:38:28] <shoky> which i have no clue about
[18:38:51] <b-lew_> really dang... I've tried googling the problem
[18:38:53] <b-lew_> no luck
[18:39:22] <b-lew_> I did this, http://groups.google.com/group/fancybox/browse_thread/thread/8c50659a082f9272
[18:39:25] <b-lew_> no luck
[18:39:32] <b-lew_> not for sure why

[18:42:34] <haizum> haha, got it. just had to style the sucker :P
[18:53:54] <wellchester> hello. what's the proper way to attach static methods to a plugin created with the widget factory?
[18:54:51] <wellchester> should i just attach something to $.myPluginName to be called without an element or is there more to it?
[18:55:14] <Eviltwin> wellchester: Why not just put them in a scope outside the $.widget(...)
[18:55:29] <Eviltwin> (function($) { /* static stuff here */ $.widget(...) })(jQuery);
[18:56:17] <wellchester> Eviltwin: i mean static methods for users of my plugin
[18:56:24] <wellchester> maybe global method is a better name
[18:59:32] <wellchester> so i have $( "#foo" ).myPlugin(...) but i also have some methods that relate to each plugin on the page
[18:59:46] <wellchester> all plugins on the page*
[19:02:22] <Eviltwin> So you put those where I showed you and you're fine
[19:02:39] <Eviltwin> To code inside the (function($) { ... })(jQuery) they act like global functions / variables
[19:02:48] <Eviltwin> But they're unreachable from the outside
[19:02:53] <Eviltwin> Almost like they don't even exist
[19:02:58] <wellchester> i want them to be reachable
[19:03:13] <Eviltwin> You want them to be reachable from global scope?
[19:03:26] <wellchester> well that's what i'm asking about, where to attach them
[19:03:41] <Eviltwin> So users of this plugin will use these methods directly?
[19:03:53] <wellchester> i have a set of methods that apply to every instance of my plugin currently on the page
[19:04:10] <wellchester> that are intended for the user of the plugin
[19:04:33] <Eviltwin> When I would probably put them at $.myPluginName
[19:04:42] <Eviltwin> Like $.myPluginName.resetAll() etc
[19:04:47] <wellchester> ah okay
[19:04:47] <jacof> Can you set up a loop using .pipe()? How ?
[19:04:52] <wellchester> thanks :)
[19:04:59] <Eviltwin> jacof: A loop?
[19:05:23] <wellchester> Eviltwin: should i attach them after the widget factory code? won't mess up any namespacing to before?
[19:05:32] <jacof> Eviltwin I need to download a set of N images, in order. Each time one download completes, It'll pipe() through to the next, but that implies it should be a loop
[19:06:39] <Eviltwin> Actually that implies it should be a chain :P
[19:06:56] <jacof> Eviltwin, but I don't know the value of N
[19:07:11] <Eviltwin> wellchester: Methods like addClass that get used like $("...").addClass(...) actually live at $.fn.addClass
[19:07:14] <Eviltwin> Not $.addClass
[19:07:31] <wellchester> okay great thanks a lot
[19:07:54] <eworbit> are there people out there for hire (via paypal) to help me complete a jquery project?
[19:08:03] <Eviltwin> jacof: I've done stuff like this before. If you can give a few more details, I can probably help you out
[19:08:51] <Eviltwin> Like if you don't know N, how do you know when you're done?
[19:09:34] <jacof> Eviltwin This is the scenario: 1.- Get JSON data from an API (an array of image urls). 2.- Parse the data. 3.- For each image, download from server.
[19:09:50] <Eviltwin> And you want to download them in serial, not in parallel?
[19:10:03] <jacof> Eviltwin But I need it to download the images in order. I can't use async:false in $.ajax because it'll freeze the browser.
[19:10:07] <jacof> Right
[19:10:22] <Eviltwin> You also should just never use async: false
[19:10:52] <jacof> Well, to be honest, they don't have to be downloaded in order, but when they are all done, I need to call even another function.
[19:11:05] <jacof> So I must definitely wait until they are all donwloaded.
[19:11:09] <Eviltwin> Right
[19:11:10] <jacof> *downloaded
[19:11:12] <Eviltwin> Take a look at $.when
[19:11:16] <Eviltwin> Might interest you
[19:11:29] <jacof> I sense this will interest me.
[19:11:48] <jacof> great :P
[19:12:26] <jacof> Hmm. Its a brain cracker to make these pipes though.
[19:12:28] <jacof> For me at least.
[19:12:43] <Eviltwin> If it can be done in parallel
[19:12:47] <Eviltwin> You won't need a pipe for this
[19:13:03] <jacof> but I'll need it to pass the ajax success into the JSON parser
[19:13:37] <Eviltwin> Sure but you won't need to do any piping for fetching the images
[19:14:20] <jacof> OK back to coding ty
[19:16:19] <eworbit> eviltwin: do you freelance?
[19:16:26] <shadykhan> is (this > img) valid?
[19:16:34] <jtomasrl> is this correct?
[19:16:34] <jtomasrl>       CurrentId = $(this).children(".id").text()
[19:16:35] <jtomasrl>       $("div#x_"+CurrentId+" input").val
[19:18:11] <jacof> Eviltwin, but this is a problem. If the number of images is unknown, then the number of $.ajax() calls to get them is also unknown, which means I don't have control of the variable names that'll hold the ajax responses. How can I structure the .when() then ?
[19:19:34] <danzik17> jacof:  give it an array.  $.when.apply( null, arrayOfDeferreds ).done( function() ..... )
[19:20:09] <Eviltwin> jacof: http://jsfiddle.net/GxfTv/
[19:22:02] <jacof> wow, thanks.
[19:25:37] <Eviltwin> jacof: Here it is as a chain: http://jsfiddle.net/GxfTv/2/
[19:28:22] <tash> to pass multiple parameters to .load, does this look right? $("#id").load( "url", "param1=blah, param2=blahblah" );  ?
[19:28:38] <jacof> Eviltwin that's just beautiful
[19:28:40] <Eviltwin> jacof: Here it is with the logic encapsulated into a "worker": http://jsfiddle.net/GxfTv/3/
[19:28:40] <tash> i want to pass param1 and param2 to url
[19:29:33] <Eviltwin> jacof: And here's the real magic
[19:29:42] <Eviltwin> jacof: Here's two workers working in parallel to fetch all of them: http://jsfiddle.net/GxfTv/4/
[19:29:58] <Eviltwin> Each worker only does one thing at a time but they're both fetching the next available URL
[19:30:13] <Eviltwin> tash: What you want is either $("#id").load( "url", "param1=blah&param2=blahblah" );
[19:30:28] <Eviltwin> Or $("#id").load( "url", { param1: "blah", param2: "blahblah" });
[19:31:05] <tash> Evinltwin: thanks, going to try it out now
[19:31:17] <jacof> Eviltwin You actually initialize the workers when you use $.when(worker("A"), worker("B")).done(function(), right ?
[19:31:23] <Eviltwin> Yes
[19:31:25] <tash> I actually just found something on stackoverflow saying about the same thing
[19:31:27] <Eviltwin> And you don't have to do it that way
[19:31:31] <Eviltwin> I just chose to for simplicity
[19:31:38] <Eviltwin> Those could go into variables if you wanted
[19:31:47] <Eviltwin> The worker could return an object with some controls to it or something
[19:31:55] <Eviltwin> Like a .start() method and .stop() method etc
[19:32:23] <Eviltwin> The point is that this would be a massive pain in the ass without Deferreds
[19:32:29] <Eviltwin> And is almost child's play with them
[19:32:40] <Eviltwin> Take it from me
[19:32:47] <Hilton> Looking for some assistance to simulate some CSS hover properties, but adding some transition effects. I have a series of div/spans (simulating a table without the annoying restrictions of the table); the important part is: .row span has white-space: nowrap, overflow: hidden, text-overflow: ellipses; and .row:hover span sets white-space: normal.
[19:33:00] <Eviltwin> I had to do something like this before I knew what Deferreds were (may have even been before they were conceptualized)
[19:33:04] <Hilton> Don't need it written for me, just point me in the right direction please! :)
[19:33:15] <Eviltwin> In the end I ended up writing something very similar to how Deferreds work
[19:33:28] <jacof> Eviltwin For me, its easy to read, but very difficult to write
[19:33:31] <shoky> Eviltwin: very cool fiddles
[19:33:39] <Eviltwin> jacof: Takes a little bit to get used to
[19:33:52] <Eviltwin> jacof: I'm definitely taking advantage of JavaScript's scoping here
[19:34:34] <jacof> Maybe its just the fact that the .done(next); thing is inside the next() function itself. Somehow I couldn't figure it out, haha
[19:34:38] <Hilton> err
[19:34:57] <Eviltwin> jacof: Deferred recursion
[19:35:01] <Hilton> How can I select the sub-children of $(this)? like all span elements below $(this)
[19:35:08] <Eviltwin> Hilton: see ?find
[19:35:09] <bot-t> Hilton, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[19:35:19] <jacof> Eviltwin that's what I was childishly calling a "loop" before, I guess.
[19:35:25] <Eviltwin> jacof: Ah, I see
[19:35:34] <shoky> heh
[19:35:38] <Eviltwin> I mean it is effectively a loop
[19:35:46] <RandalSchwartz> $(this).find('span')
[19:35:59] <Eviltwin> Some programming languages don't have things like while and for loops and use recursion instead
[19:36:15] <RandalSchwartz> recursion  or iteration>
[19:36:22] <jacof> Well but I was all over the place. I was thinking of doing it with pipes() and I just couldn't see it. So thank you very much.
[19:36:40] <RandalSchwartz> pipes!
[19:37:07] <jacof> -_-
[19:38:25] <Eviltwin> jacof: I think I know what you were trying for
[19:38:43] <Eviltwin> Piping one of these into the next or something like that
[19:38:54] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure it would have quite worked
[19:39:05] <jacof> Eviltwin, I reckon it would be something like replacing .done(next) with .pipe(function() { next(); }
[19:39:07] <Eviltwin> You still need a deferred that you can return right away
[19:39:18] <Eviltwin> jacof: You could do that but it wouldn't get you anything
[19:39:36] <jacof> Eviltwin right it would be useless
[19:48:51] <Hilton> rrr
[19:49:00] <Hilton> I can't even reproduce the CSS with jQuery, much less add animation.
[19:49:21] <Eviltwin> Hilton: Can you make an demo of what you have at jsfiddle.net?
[19:49:23] <Eviltwin> Just the basics
[19:49:30] <Eviltwin> Don't try to build a whole website in there
[19:49:45] <Hilton> heh
[19:51:26] <eworbit> is there any free lancer that would entertain helping me complete this?:  http://www.anglertrek.com/test.html
[19:52:24] <Eviltwin> eworbit: It's actually not too hard to do with connectWIth
[19:52:27] <Eviltwin> connectWith*
[19:52:49] <Eviltwin> You just give each item a child list that has the same class as all the others and as the top-level
[19:52:58] <Eviltwin> Then use connectWith on that class
[19:53:06] <Eviltwin> And you should be able to drag things freely inside of other things
[19:54:57] <Hilton> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/EwwfY/
[19:56:01] <Hilton> Eviltwin: The CSS works perfectly if you uncomment it; hover the element and white-space changes and the whole element displays with normal wrapping. I simply want to take that effect and add animation so it's not such a harsh change.
[19:56:52] <Eviltwin> Hilton: Wrong method: http://jsfiddle.net/EwwfY/1/
[19:58:17] <Hilton> Ah hah. Now how do I turn that into an animation without having predefined sizes?
[19:58:35] <pneftali> hi guys - i just downloaded jquery 1.7.2 .. it says the minified is 32kb but after downloading it, the actual size is 98kb....
[19:59:00] <eworbit> no, I don't want to drag items from one group to another.    I just need help determining why the bb.watermark plugin chunks the input value with I run the tidyuptheol() code clean-up function.
[19:59:30] <Eviltwin> Hilton: The only wat I know for sure that works is a little messy
[20:03:31] <Eviltwin> Hilton: Probably needs some work to get it to play nice: http://jsfiddle.net/EwwfY/2/
[20:03:42] <Eviltwin> But it's a step in the right direction
[20:04:27] <Hilton> Oh my
[20:06:02] <pneftali> what's the difference between the minified and packed versions ?
[20:06:19] <Eviltwin> Here: http://jsfiddle.net/EwwfY/4/
[20:06:34] <Eviltwin> pneftali: Minified and packed mean the same thing
[20:06:56] <Eviltwin> There are some well known tools that call themselves "minifier" or "packer" that might have different strengths and weaknesses
[20:07:00] <Eviltwin> But the idea is the same
[20:07:04] <Eviltwin> Generally
[20:07:06] <xinming> yuwang: I mean div, p, h1
[20:07:11] <pneftali> Eviltwin: "The minified versions, while having a larger file size than the packed versions..."
[20:07:26] <Eviltwin> Oh, in that case they're referring to packing where you don't change the variable names
[20:07:32] <pneftali> so i'm guessing the packed versions are the zipped once
[20:07:33] <Eviltwin> Or make code substitutions
[20:07:36] <xinming> raj: I don't mean the name attribute, I mean the "element" "name"
[20:08:10] <xinming> Anyone here tells me how do we get the element name for the result of $('#name_of_element') ?
[20:08:31] <Eviltwin> xinming: $('#name_of_element')[0].nodeName
[20:08:57] <xinming> Eviltwin: Thanks.
[20:20:21] <pneftali> in terms of perfomance, is faster to load jquery from cdn or have it loaded from your server ?
[20:20:21] <pneftali> is it*
[20:20:38] <Eviltwin> Probably CDN
[20:20:42] <Eviltwin> If it's a good CDN
[20:20:55] <Eviltwin> There's a small trade off
[20:20:59] <Eviltwin> It does mean another DNS lookup
[20:21:09] <Eviltwin> But those are *usually* pretty fast
[20:21:40] <Eviltwin> Because it's on another domain, it will be downloaded in parallel with other scripts from your domain
[20:21:51] <Eviltwin> Instead of serially
[20:21:54] <Eviltwin> So that will most likely pay off
[20:22:08] <Eviltwin> Plus if they've come from another site that uses the same CDN
[20:22:13] <Eviltwin> It will likely already be in their cache
[20:22:24] <Eviltwin> Avoiding the need to download it at all
[20:26:21] <raj> why use `this` instead of `elem` in .each(function(i, elem){...})?
[20:26:28] <raj> or vice versa
[20:26:49] <gf3> raj: which do you like better?
[20:26:51] <Eviltwin> If you nest another function inside the function(i, elem){...} "this" might refer to something else
[20:27:01] <raj> ok, understood
[20:27:02] <raj> thanks
[20:27:26] <Eviltwin> But using "this" means you can just do .each(function() { ... })
[20:27:41] <gf3> as they say, in the butt
[20:27:45] <gf3> what what
[20:30:41] <PriNet> droppin like flies in a porchlight...
[20:30:51] <gf3> how apt
[20:31:04] <Eviltwin> Like apt-get
[20:31:12] <gf3> but more sinister
[20:31:50] <pneftali> Eviltwin: cool, gotcha. but i'm looking at big companies using jquery, the ones listed on jquery.com, specifically netflix and nbc, they all have their own copy of jquery loaded from their servers and not from cdn. prolly for safer practice ?
[20:32:26] <Eviltwin> pneftali: Are you sure it's not from their own CDN?
[20:32:30] <gf3> pneftali: I'm sure both of those companies have their own CDN
[20:34:08] <pneftali> ohh. so they got their own cdn.. and not from the public ones like the ones hosted by google
[20:36:46] <Eviltwin> pneftali: Large companies generally either have their own CDN or at least set up their own DNS for a CDN that hosts all of their resources
[20:37:01] <Eviltwin> Rarely a public CDN but sometimes they don't own it themselves, they just pay for use
[20:39:35] <pneftali> i see... for my personal site i'd be better off using the ones from google..
[20:39:57] <Eviltwin> Yes
[20:41:21] <pneftali> Eviltwin: thanks for  your input. appreciate it :)
[20:41:27] <Eviltwin> No problem
[21:06:15] <abnormalex> anyone please like to recommend a form validate .js script?
[21:08:02] <Eviltwin> ?g jquery validate @ abnormalex
[21:08:03] <bot-t> abnormalex, bassistance.de  jQuery plugin: Validation - http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[21:08:36] <abnormalex> thanks. anything else maybe lighter? i think that requires jquery?
[21:16:35] <abnormalex> should a salt be re-created each time a user logs in?
[21:19:34] <Hilton> abnormalex: You realize you're in #jquery right?
[21:19:46] <Hilton> Of course that requires jquery.
[21:20:37] <abnormalex> yeah but i know there are a lot of geniouses
[21:20:48] <abnormalex> just wondering if anyone recommends a very simple lightweight validation script
[21:21:57] <deeprogram1> hi ? how to find target with name ?
[21:22:12] <deeprogram1> $([name=""]) ths?
[21:30:09] <Hilton> exactly.
[21:30:21] <Hilton> ish.
[21:31:30] <Hilton> $('[name=foo]').click(function(){ alert($(this).attr('name')); });
[21:43:02] <coldhead> AND WHAT TIME WILL YOU BE COMING IN
[21:45:04] <abjorn> wat
[21:45:05] <bot-t> (5 hours 33 mins ago) <imsky> tell abjorn i just teleported to chicago bro, shoulda been there
[21:45:21] <abjorn> bot-t: tell imsky fuk dat
[21:45:21] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[21:45:37] <coldhead> that imsky is such a hater
[21:45:42] <coldhead> remember that time he hated on that thing?
[21:45:43] <coldhead> lol
[21:54:22] <silverhand> Is it possible to define multiple mouse events in a single command? I don't want to have to repeat the selector if it's avoidable, to make it more maintainable in future.
[21:54:51] <Eviltwin> You mean a single .on / .bind / .delegate?
[21:55:17] <silverhand> Eviltwin: No, I want to define a mouesover and mouseout for a single div
[21:55:47] <Eviltwin> Okay...have you used jQuery before?
[21:55:47] <silverhand> Hmm, chaining them seems to work. Is there any reason why this is a bad idea?
[21:56:01] <silverhand> Eviltwin: I have, but my experience is patchy.
[21:56:24] <Eviltwin> Are you doing something like $("...").mouseover(...).mouseout(...) ?
[21:56:31] <silverhand> Eviltwin: Yes.
[21:56:38] <Eviltwin> Those bind event listeners
[21:56:46] <silverhand> Eviltwin: Exactly that.
[21:56:49] <Eviltwin> Things like .click, .mouseover, .mouseout
[21:57:08] <Eviltwin> In jQuery 1.7+ .click(...) just calls .on("click", ...)
[21:57:18] <Eviltwin> And .mouseover just calls .on("mouseover", ...)
[21:57:19] <Eviltwin> Etc
[21:57:44] <Eviltwin> .on itself accepts an "events-map" in one syntax
[21:58:03] <Eviltwin> So you can do $("...").on({ mouseover: ..., mouseout: ... });
[21:58:05] <Eviltwin> Or chain
[21:58:11] <Eviltwin> There's no problem with chaining
[21:58:30] <Eviltwin> It might be very marginally faster to do it with the object but nothing to really be concerned about
[21:58:39] <silverhand> Eviltwin: Thanks. I think chaining is a little more readable.
[21:59:07] <coldhead> chaining is the jQuery way
[21:59:16] <coldhead> the more the better
[21:59:17] <aqeel> hiroom
[21:59:23] <Eviltwin> coldhead: Shut up, it's your first day using jQuery
[21:59:31] <aqeel> ??
[21:59:38] <aqeel> why the fight?
[21:59:42] <silverhand> Eviltwin: haha, seriously?
[22:00:21] <silverhand> Chaining is more consistent with ruby, which is what I am coding the larger project in.
[22:00:21] <Eviltwin> No not really
[22:00:25] <Eviltwin> It's a running joke
[22:00:39] <coldhead> it's no joke, i've been chaining jQuery all day!
[22:00:45] <coldhead> works grea
[22:00:46] <coldhead> t
[22:00:48] <coldhead> thanks room
[22:00:55] <aqeel> well jquey have implemented this then what is the big deal?
[22:01:20] <coldhead> it's not that big  a deal, i was just proud of my modest accomplishment
[22:01:27] <coldhead> you are right aqeel, i should be ashamed
[22:01:28] <coldhead> i am sorry
[22:01:59] <aqeel> this can be found in documentation of jquery...
[22:02:20] <aqeel> chaining helps to reduce the clutter otherwise there is
[22:02:33] <silverhand> Eviltwin: So should I be using event listeners, or that alternative you suggested?
[22:02:59] <Eviltwin> silverhand: No matter what you're doing, you're using event listeners
[22:03:16] <silverhand> Eviltwin: Oh, good. That's what I thought. You confused me.
[22:03:30] <aqeel> well room any can test this on ie6, not emulation......
[22:03:35] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[22:03:42] <Eviltwin> What you're using is a shortcut for binding an event listener
[22:03:46] <aqeel> and compare it with in ie9?
[22:03:48] <Eviltwin> It still ends up getting bound the exact same way
[22:04:10] <Eviltwin> There are just some events that don't have a shorthand like that
[22:04:19] <silverhand> Eviltwin: Ah, I see.
[22:04:51] <RockPaperNode> is there an event that can check when a tag has a value?
[22:04:59] <aqeel> any please....tell me the result.....is it looking good or is it broken/
[22:04:59] <Eviltwin> No
[22:06:04] <aqeel> because locally using xpmode ie6....works fine....need the audience to test it
[22:06:12] <coldhead> aqeel: i don't know a living soul who still has ie6, i am sorry
[22:06:28] <coldhead> ie6 is older than my boyfriend
[22:06:50] <aqeel> well pie supports ie6,7,8...so getting it to support ie6,7,8....
[22:07:11] <aqeel> if 6 is good then 7, 8 will automatically be good
[22:07:13] <fzzbt> you pedo
[22:07:15] <coldhead> why don't you just assume it works until someone complains
[22:07:40] <tw2113> coldhead are you a n00b again?
[22:07:43] <aqeel> well 9 be best and latest browser....
[22:07:48] <tw2113> are you in jQuery groundhog day?
[22:08:12] <coldhead> this is the first day i can remember
[22:10:40] <aqeel> ok lunch time....be back in 1-2 hour
[22:10:45] <aqeel> bye room
[22:11:00] <coldhead> we'll miss you aqeel
[22:11:08] <coldhead> you are the joy in my heart
[22:11:24] <coldhead> bot-t: tell aqeel i will never ever forget you, fox sugar honey lover
[22:11:25] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[22:11:28] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[22:11:28] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[22:27:37] <RockPaperNode> how can i wait until a value is not undefined?
[22:28:08] <Cork> you would have to build a timer loop
[22:28:15] <hobs> coldhead did know, but he wants to show appreciation to his robutte brethern bot-t
[22:28:30] <hobs> thanks again robot friend
[22:39:26] <Lonestar99> does the following work if any div is clicked?   $("div").click(function(stt) { ....}
[22:39:42] <astropirate> Lonestar99, should
[22:39:44] <Cork> Lonestar99: if the divs existed when you run it yes
[22:39:55] <Cork> but not if they'r added afterwards
[22:40:08] <Cork> and its unessesarly slowing down your dom
[22:40:35] <astropirate> DOM is my favorite API
[22:40:44] <astropirate> right after  WinAPI
[22:40:48] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'div') is a better option (or if your using an olderversion of jquery use delegate)
[22:41:31] <progrock> do you have to do anythign special to get github to render markdown?... it seems to work when I preview my index.markdown, but when I visit my gh-pages site, it doesn;t process any of the markdown http://novus.github.com/nvd3/
[22:41:38] <Lonestar99> function needs to check to see if div clicked is a number or not...
[22:42:11] <Cork> Lonestar99: theres no difference to the callback
[22:42:38] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'div', function(event) { $(this).??? })
[22:43:52] <aqeel> hi room
[22:43:52] <bot-t> (32 mins 20 secs ago) <coldhead> tell aqeel i will never ever forget you, fox sugar honey lover
[22:44:02] <Lonestar99> k let me try your solution
[22:57:09] <auzigog> Question: I can't think of what to google for for this effect I'm looking for. It's the effect on certain blogs where you have the text headers to the side of the body text and when you scroll past each header, it pushes the old header up, then takes its place as a fixed element on the page as you scroll. Does that make sense? Where can I find something like that?
[22:59:16] <vl1234> gud morning every1\
[22:59:30] <Cork> auzigog: you talking about sticky headers?
[22:59:48] <auzigog> cork: yes! that sounds much more descriptive!
[22:59:51] <auzigog> haha
[23:00:01] <auzigog> ill go google for that. know of any good plugins?
[23:00:19] <Cork> ?g jquery sticky header
[23:00:20] <bot-t> Cork, Automatic Header stick to scroll with jQuery | ruturaj.net - http://www.ruturaj.net/automatic-header-stick-to-scroll-with-jquery/
[23:00:32] <auzigog> hehe. :)
[23:00:37] <auzigog> sweet. thanks
[23:18:52] <auzigog> cork: so i'm looking for "sticky section headers" similar to the demo at the bottom of this page: http://polarblau.github.com/stickySectionHeaders/ … but I want that effect with h2 elements in a long article on my page. do you know of any existing plugins like that? I can't find any after googling for a while.
[23:20:08] <Eviltwin> auzigog: I had the makings of something like that a while back but never finished it
[23:20:15] <Eviltwin> You might be able to adapt the code they have there
[23:21:05] <auzigog> yeah for sure. i guess i've seen this effect enough places that i expected it to be a plugin already. if it is a plugin, its certainly not called "sticky headers" or "sticky section headers" because i've exhausted those search terms. :)
[23:21:32] <auzigog> ill keep googling. and then try messing with existing plugins if i cant find anything
[23:21:40] <auzigog> this also looks promising: http://www.vertstudios.com/blog/jquery-sticky-scroller-position-fixed-plugin/
[23:21:50] <auzigog> and jquery waypoints might be abel to accomplish it: http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/#examples
[23:22:38] <auzigog> also bootstrap scroolspy might be something i can hook into to solve part of this.
[23:22:50] <D4> auzigog  The plugin you linked can handle that?
[23:23:01] <D4> headlineSelector: 'h2'
[23:23:19] <Lonestar99> i have a javascript slider what is the best jquery event  i should use when moving slider --> mousedown ??
[23:23:33] <Eviltwin> Probably mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup
[23:23:40] <Eviltwin> For clicking, dragging, and releasing
[23:24:33] <auzigog> D4: thats just the selector within a <li> … and i'm talking about sections of a page and <h2>  … ehre's the code: https://github.com/polarblau/stickySectionHeaders/blob/master/src/jquery.stickysectionheaders.js
[23:25:09] <D4> Then modify it to match your markup for an article?
[23:26:03] <Lonestar99> Eviltwin: yeah might have to use all three =(
[23:27:07] <Eviltwin> Lonestar99: I have no idea how you plan to make a slider without all three
[23:27:14] <coldhead> i miss that aqeel dude
[23:28:23] <auzigog> D4: Yeah, that's likely what I'll do
[23:28:31] <Lonestar99> Eviltwin:  it is already built and working, but need it to change sizes dynamically,so testing that out...
[23:28:58] <raj> can I do $(document).on('click', function(e){}) ... except for one particular div?
[23:29:06] <raj> without using clickoutside
[23:29:35] <Lonestar99> Eviltwin:  ok kinda works with mousedown...but glitchy
[23:29:49] <Eviltwin> Sliding implies clicking and dragging
[23:30:03] <Lonestar99> yeah
[23:30:16] <Cork> raj: you mean you want to check if the click is outside the named div?
[23:30:36] <raj> yes
[23:30:53] <Cork> raj: then you need to bind it on document
[23:31:05] <raj> cuz i'm gonna change some classes on document.click...but I don't wanna do so if that particular div is clicked
[23:31:16] <Cork> you could do something like $(document).one('click.my_special_div', function(e){})
[23:31:50] <Eviltwin> ?g outside events @ raj, Cork
[23:31:52] <bot-t> Eviltwin, FeileAfrica News - http://www.feileafrica.com/feileafrica_news.htm
[23:31:54] <Eviltwin> ...
[23:31:59] <Eviltwin> ?g jquery outside events @ raj, Cork
[23:32:09] <Eviltwin> Okay...
[23:32:10] <bot-t> Eviltwin, No results found for 'jquery outside events @ raj, Cork'.
[23:32:20] <Eviltwin> Strange
[23:32:20] <Eviltwin> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[23:34:10] <raj> yeah, i was trying not to use that
[23:34:14] <raj> but I guess I have no choice
[23:34:21] <Eviltwin> Why not
[23:34:27] <Eviltwin> It's like 1k and it does exactly what you want to do
[23:34:36] <Eviltwin> Copy/paste it into your <script> tag if you want
[23:35:47] <raj> yeah
[23:35:49] <raj> ok fine
[23:48:19] <auzigog> finally found what i was looking for: http://css-tricks.com/examples/PersistantHeaders/
[23:49:00] <astropirate> auzigog, http://cdn.head-fi.org/2/2c/2cda10c2_slow-clap.gif
[23:49:08] <auzigog> ;)
[23:49:30] * auzigog wins the googling badge for the day
[23:49:39] <coldhead> name the film and who he's applauding
[23:49:40] <astropirate> lol
[23:49:47] <astropirate> idk :(
[23:49:53] <coldhead> it's citizen kane
[23:49:58] <coldhead> and he's applauding his wife
[23:50:02] <coldhead> he paid for her show
[23:50:06] <coldhead> which everyone hated
[23:50:09] <astropirate> good movie?
[23:50:19] <coldhead> pretty excellent, yeah
[23:50:42] <astropirate> wonderful
[23:50:52] <astropirate> i might watch it on a dreadfully boring sunday afternoon
[23:51:00] <astropirate> xD
[23:51:34] <coldhead> that's probably the right time for it
[23:51:53] <astropirate> haha
[23:51:55] <coldhead> i guess it's mostly of interest to film students and potheads
[23:53:21] <astropirate> ohh lol then i wont' like it
[23:53:35] <coldhead> it might not be your favourite movie ever
[23:53:39] <coldhead> but it's Important
[23:53:48] <coldhead> and it explains a lot of simpsons references
[23:53:54] <coldhead> Rosebud &c.
[23:54:14] <Lonestar99> when using --> $(document).on('click', 'div', function(stt) {  $("#s0").val(stt); }  I get  [object][object]  how do i get the "id" of div being clicked?
[23:55:31] <astropirate> Lonestar99, $(document).on('click', 'div', function(stt) {  $("#s0").attr('id'); }
[23:56:49] <Lonestar99> astropirate:  what about -->  $("#s0").val(this.id); ??
[23:57:40] <Cork> Lonestar99: $(document).on('click', 'div', function(event) {  $(this).attr('id'); });
[23:58:03] <Lonestar99> k thanks
[23:58:07] <Cork> Lonestar99: but yes, this.id should work too
[23:58:22] <astropirate> what he said
[23:59:15] <Lonestar99> k thanks
