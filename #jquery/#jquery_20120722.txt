[00:27:49] <GoSox> <a>this text</a>
[00:28:43] <abjorn> $("a").text()

[00:28:49] <abjorn> .html()
[00:29:03] <GoSox> cool

[00:29:08] <abjorn> sorry for the slurring, im drunk as hell
[00:29:08] <GoSox> right
[00:29:11] <GoSox> hah
[00:29:11] <wookiehangover> .text() is probably what you're looking for
[00:29:19] <abjorn> ^
[00:29:35] <abjorn> since you usually wont have any child elments in an <a>
[00:29:36] <GoSox> i'm picking up this jquery heavy html5 site after building half of it 2 months ago
[00:29:40] <abjorn> though sometimes, depends on what you're doing

[00:32:15] <abjorn> idk, im getting more used the server administration thign
[00:32:16] <GoSox> i was on a roll, then suddenly found a deal on a $600 2009 Xserve
[00:32:31] <GoSox> and i had to take it, i needed a new server bad, my old one was a 2005 G5 xserve
[00:32:40] <abjorn> what kin of server
[00:32:42] <abjorn> limux or
[00:32:44] <abjorn> linux
[00:32:46] <GoSox> Mac OS X
[00:32:46] <abjorn> or windows
[00:32:48] <abjorn> OH GOD

[00:33:21] <GoSox> FYI i'm not running Lion
[00:33:31] <abjorn> either way
[00:33:32] <abjorn> lmfao
[00:33:45] <abjorn> linux server is the only way to go
[00:33:51] <abjorn> well, linux or bsd
[00:33:54] <GoSox> well, clearly it isn't
[00:33:55] <abjorn> preferrably linux
[00:34:01] <GoSox> www.whatsmyip.org
[00:34:02] <abjorn> osx is KIND OF bsd
[00:34:09] <abjorn> but
[00:34:11] <GoSox> ^ my server working well

[00:42:07] <abjorn> i been drunk tweeting gf3
[00:42:11] <abjorn> it hasn't turned out in my favor
[00:42:14] <tw2113> coldhead anyone who says that there are no good domains available is lying to you
[00:42:20] <abjorn> 6
[00:42:22] <abjorn> ^
[00:42:24] <tw2113> you just need to start registering the names of fictional characters
[00:42:44] <abjorn> best registered domain: http://tittiesnkitties.com
[00:43:09] <tw2113> and you typed that without typo
[00:43:16] <abjorn> lol
[00:43:20] <abjorn> i trieds very hard
[00:43:25] <coldhead> i enjoyed the gf3 exchange
[00:43:28] <abjorn> lol
[00:43:32] <coldhead> he holds his liqour better than you, abjorn
[00:43:33] <abjorn> me hating on osx
[00:43:33] <tw2113> pun intended with the "hard" part abjorn ?
[00:43:34] <abjorn> as usual
[00:43:39] <coldhead> that man can drink
[00:43:41] <abjorn> coldhead: he's drinking beer
[00:43:45] <abjorn> not whiskey
[00:43:53] <abjorn> beer = 3-7% alcohol
[00:43:53] <coldhead> no, i've drunk with him
[00:43:57] <coldhead> he can hold it
[00:43:58] <abjorn> whiskey = 40% alcohol
[00:44:16] <abjorn> lol maybe so
[00:44:20] <abjorn> i can hold it too
[00:44:22] <abjorn> pretty well
[00:44:31] <abjorn> because im a large person, and because of the family blood
[00:44:42] <abjorn> im 100 feet tall
[00:45:02] <coldhead> like drink for drink with him, and i was weeping and jabbering incoherently and he's flirting with bar keeps and flawlessly enunciating "i believe i shall have another of your fine ales please"
[00:45:10] <abjorn> i want to drink with you two
[00:45:11] <abjorn> come to austin
[00:45:12] <abjorn> so i can

[00:45:33] <abjorn> i tried
[00:45:40] <abjorn> but that stupid random draw
[00:45:59] <coldhead> it was tough on all of us
[00:46:08] <coldhead> you coulda still crashed the parties
[00:46:12] <guy> Is there a js plugin that would automatically check CSS if it is missing -moz of whatever else prefixes and add them? eg. if I wrote CSS code { border-radius: 5px; } and current browser does not support it, but supports -moz-border-radius, script would automatically add the rule
[00:46:13] <abjorn> i should've
[00:46:15] <abjorn> i really should've
[00:46:27] <tw2113> ?g prefixer
[00:46:27] <b-ot> tw2113, Nettuts+ Prefixr ‚Üí http://prefixr.com/

[00:47:00] <coldhead> sounds fun
[00:47:03] <abjorn> wny would i go there
[00:47:06] <coldhead> long old way away though

[00:47:10] <coldhead> toronto is very nice
[00:47:17] <coldhead> do you have a passport, abjorn ?
[00:47:20] <abjorn> no

[00:48:03] <muzone> all i get is full screen
[00:48:07] <abjorn> coldhead: we need more things in texas
[00:48:14] <coldhead> agreed
[00:48:16] <abjorn> theres lots of action going on in austin, its a shame
[00:48:20] <coldhead> like more ice ages
[00:48:24] <tw2113> however, i'd say "fuck the browsers that don't support non-prefixed border radii"
[00:48:25] <abjorn> rofl
[00:48:26] <abjorn> uyes
[00:48:27] <abjorn> god
[00:48:30] <tw2113> and just give them square corners
[00:48:32] <abjorn> it was 100 degrees in austin today
[00:48:38] <coldhead> death
[00:49:07] <abjorn> literally, i went to the grocery store to get some booze and checked the weather app cause i was like "holy shit its hot" and it was 100
[00:49:59] <abjorn> i rteally dont know what sgoing on in this anime im watching on netflix
[00:54:10] <abjorn> coldhead: this owuld be so much better if imsky was around right now
[00:54:44] <GoSox> its been 100+¬∞ everywhere lately
[00:54:53] <tw2113> it's like it's summer
[00:55:10] <GoSox> it's like it's a global-warming-enhanced summer
[00:55:15] <GoSox> and i gotta tell ya, it's great
[00:55:24] <BoMbMoNkEy> In Australia, its COLD!
[00:55:34] <GoSox> global warming is a terrible thing... except for the actual results of it :) which are awesome
[00:56:15] <tw2113> in australia it's winter
[00:56:22] <abjorn> record high's in texas
[00:56:23] <abjorn> this summer
[00:56:57] <BoMbMoNkEy> tw2113: Yup
[00:58:41] <abjorn> coldhead: lmfao gf3 is eating chicken mcnuggets and drinking wine
[00:58:58] <GoSox> i wish i had some chicken nuggets right now
[00:59:10] <abjorn> doesn't everybody?
[00:59:22] <GoSox> oh wait i do have a big grilled chicken breast in the fridge
[00:59:28] <abjorn> DO IT
[00:59:29] <coldhead> chickens don't wish that
[00:59:34] <abjorn> chicken is gods gift to the world
[00:59:36] <GoSox> grilled isn't as tasty as fried, but adding bacon makes up for the difference
[00:59:43] <abjorn> yes it does
[00:59:44] <abjorn> and thensome
[00:59:56] <abjorn> grilled chicken + bacon = oh god orgasm in my mouth
[01:00:05] <BoMbMoNkEy> GoSox: I have two big breasts here that I suck on.
[01:00:14] <abjorn> almost as good as a steak wrapped in steak
[01:00:16] <GoSox> mine are on vacation, hence me GETTING WORK DONE
[01:00:22] <abjorn> wrapped in bacon
[01:00:23] <abjorn> i mean
[01:02:13] <abjorn> although, steak wrapped in steak sounds AWESOME
[01:02:17] <AlecTaylor> hi
[01:02:22] <abjorn> HEY
[01:02:24] <abjorn> HOWS IT GOING
[01:02:26] <GoSox> chicken wrapped in steak wrapped in bacon
[01:02:27] <abjorn> WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU
[01:02:37] <abjorn> oh my god gosox i love you i must have that now
[01:02:41] <AlecTaylor> abjorn: Raging at implementing JSONRPC with javascript >.<
[01:02:52] <abjorn> >rpc
[01:02:53] <GoSox> abjorn: make it happen
[01:02:54] <abjorn> that's your problem
[01:02:57] <abjorn> rpc is so 200 6
[01:02:59] <AlecTaylor> ya
[01:03:07] <AlecTaylor> All the tutorials are crap
[01:03:11] <BoMbMoNkEy> whats the alternative to rpc?
[01:03:18] <abjorn> rest + json is the new meta
[01:03:50] <AlecTaylor> Nothing shows a simple HTML page with a bit of javascript calling a function (GET) and submitting a form (calling function... POST).
[01:04:08] <BoMbMoNkEy> json is just a string notation for describing data.
[01:04:12] <abjorn> google for ajax forms
[01:04:18] <abjorn> not that harr
[01:04:20] <abjorn> hard
[01:04:49] <AlecTaylor> abjorn: Fucking finally: http://yaws.hyber.org/json_intro.yaws
[01:05:25] <AlecTaylor> abjorn: Hold, hasn't been updated in 6 years
[01:05:32] <AlecTaylor> It's going to give me crappy security crap >.<
[01:05:43] <abjorn> all you have to od
[01:05:44] <abjorn> is
[01:05:48] <abjorn> serialize a form
[01:05:52] <abjorn> and send it to the server
[01:06:08] <abjorn> on the serverside detect whether it's ajax or not
[01:06:15] <abjorn> parse the form based on taht
[01:06:18] <abjorn> *that
[01:06:32] <BoMbMoNkEy> abjorn: why serialize a form?
[01:06:42] <abjorn> as opposed to what?
[01:06:49] <AlecTaylor> abjorn: gist?
[01:06:50] <abjorn> you want a fallback for nojs, don't you?>
[01:06:50] <BoMbMoNkEy> abjorn: you mean serialize the form data?
[01:06:57] <abjorn> im too durnk to gist
[01:07:05] <abjorn> yes i do mean that
[01:07:23] <tw2113> great, now i'm thirsty for beer, and horny
[01:07:30] <abjorn> lol
[01:07:31] <abjorn> what
[01:07:35] <tw2113> http://beerntitties.com/
[01:07:40] <abjorn> hahahaha
[01:07:42] <abjorn> oh that
[01:07:48] <abjorn> MY BAD
[01:07:50] <BoMbMoNkEy> tw2113: call one of your female clients so say "im horny! get over here now"...
[01:08:03] <abjorn> ^ BAD IDEA
[01:08:10] <abjorn> im drunk and i can recognize thats a bad idea
[01:08:12] <tw2113> i'm not drunk enough anyway
[01:08:15] <abjorn> now an ex, that's a different story
[01:08:18] <abjorn> brb texting an ex
[01:08:34] <BoMbMoNkEy> abjorn: if it works that would be awesome hey :D
[01:08:56] <abjorn> lol it wont
[01:09:01] <abjorn> my exes are stingy
[01:09:47] <tw2113> they'd make you pay the cab fare?
[01:10:00] <AlecTaylor> abjorn: O.O - Could this be?! - A recent JSONRPC client example? =- https://github.com/filonenko-mikhail/maxima-json-rpc/blob/master/examples/js-maxima-rpc-client.html
[01:10:15] <abjorn> seriously, json-rpc is a bad idea
[01:10:18] <abjorn> go with RESTful
[01:10:59] <AlecTaylor> abjorn: Why
[01:11:12] <BoMbMoNkEy> what is rest anyway :D
[01:11:39] <abjorn> it can be har dto track where errors are occurring and rpc has some bad security concerns
[01:11:42] <abjorn> imo anyways
[01:11:47] <abjorn> rest is the more modern approach
[01:12:06] <abjorn> if you want to learn REST theres all sorts of books and articles online about it
[01:12:41] <abjorn> the gneeral idea is using HTTP resoureces and URIs to transmit and transform data
[01:13:57] <abjorn> rpc is fine in non-web-based networking apis, but id take rest over rpc on a web app anyda
[01:14:00] <abjorn> anyday]
[01:14:11] <abjorn> much easier to manage the app and state imo
[01:20:18] <abjorn> bot-t: <3
[01:20:20] <bot-t> abjorn, Version 1.4.3 - All the aspects of the API that were added, or had a new signature added, in the corresponding version of jQuery. jQuery 1.4.3 Release Notes . http://api.jquery.com/category/version/1.4.3/
[01:20:26] * abjorn hugs bot-t
[01:20:26] * bot-t hugs abjorn back
[01:20:58] <abjorn> bot-t you're my only friend
[01:58:49] <Tomashe> hey gus
[01:58:58] <Tomashe> why $.post doesnt work on cross domain?
[01:59:06] <Tomashe> im trying to post to another domain :/
[01:59:11] <Tomashe> and its just not working properly
[04:20:12] <eni> So i need a couple of variables to send some AJAX requests. These variables are known from php (stuff like $_GET['lang']), but I will need the same info for the AJAX request. What is the best way to store this in the HTML? Through hidden inputs?
[04:57:19] <Hp__> I am using jquery UI/Effects/Slide to slide an image out left and slide in an image from right. but image slide out is working and image slide in from right is not. can some one look at my code
[05:00:31] <Hp__> it's a very simple piece of code
[05:00:41] <Hp__> what is the site where i would post the code
[05:01:39] <Hp__> probably 1 minute of hint would be good enough
[05:16:26] <exalt> hello
[05:34:22] <Parhs> hi dudes
[05:34:38] <Parhs> lightbox 2 isnt much customizable.. Which is a good alternative?
[05:34:45] <Parhs> I would use fancybox but it isnt free
[05:35:14] <Parhs> colorbox seems nice but i dont 100% like it
[05:50:40] <batmanbond3d> because you can't do cross domain posts
[06:06:18] <Resnik> good afternoon :)
[06:10:05] <Resnik> so, anyone willing to help me with minor script change? as i'm not a code monkey?
[06:11:10] <pachet> the implication being that we are code monkeys?
[06:11:17] <pachet> ?paste @ Resnik
[06:11:17] <bot-t> Resnik, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:14:32] <Resnik> well, the thing is, on my webpage if I hover over menu multiple times over menu, while dropdown menu is open, it reopens/closes it ... www.zoners.org and code (if I got the right one): http://fixee.org/paste/oowz7or/
[06:18:47] <voot545> attribute selectors case sensitive?
[06:19:51] <pachet> Resnik: replace all of the instances of this: '$(this).find("ul.sub-menu").eq(0).slideToggle(300);'
[06:20:24] <pachet> with this: '$(this).find('ul.sub-menu:nth-child(1)').stop().slideToggle(300);'
[06:20:40] <pachet> also your script is a wreck
[06:20:58] <Resnik> well, it came with the theme :s
[06:21:04] <Resnik> not much I can do about it sadly
[06:21:41] <pachet> aside from learning javascript, and taking your rightful place as the emperor's apprentice
[06:23:17] <Resnik> however, it looks like this is not it
[06:24:15] <Resnik> seems that http://fixee.org/paste/eg9uqvq/ thats the buggy one
[06:26:22] <Resnik> nm, clearing cache helped
[06:32:10] <Resnik> pachet: now it does not open submenu at all with that fix
[06:35:36] <pachet> Resnik: where is the script linked now?
[06:35:40] <pachet> i don't see it in your source
[06:40:24] <Resnik> pachet: its named jquery-workarounds_backup
[06:40:39] <Resnik> unless I miss-looked something
[06:44:34] <pachet> Resnik: try $('#categories ul li').eq(0).find('ul.sub-menu').eq(0).stop().slideToggle(300) instead
[06:44:57] <pachet> and damn whoever came up with the idea for hoverintent
[06:45:43] <pachet> Resnik: er, that should be $(this).find('ul.sub-menu').eq(0).stop().slideToggle(300)
[06:46:25] <ready> how can i catch the ESC key and do some action when ESC is pressed.. keyup / keydown only works for input - i need it on the whole page
[06:47:52] <Resnik> pachet: it only opens it for the first time now www.zoners.org
[06:48:03] <Resnik> :)
[06:49:05] <pachet> ready : http://jsfiddle.net/CvECe/
[06:49:49] <pachet> Resnik: see my last message
[06:51:24] <ready> thx pachet but it does not work
[06:51:33] <ready> maybe the mynamespace thing is wrong
[06:52:59] <Resnik> pachet: everything replaced with "$(this).find('ul.sub-menu').eq(0).stop().slideToggle(300)" but problem persists with not showing
[06:55:51] <pachet> ready: no, the mynamespace this is not wrong
[06:55:57] <pachet> try this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/7juct/
[06:56:01] <pachet> what browser are you using?
[06:56:23] <ready> i test with chrome
[06:56:32] <ready> ok i'll try. sec
[06:57:07] <ready> pachet: the code before or after $(document).ready(function(){....
[06:57:08] <pachet> Resnik: it's working fine for me. remember to clear your cache
[06:57:26] <ready> or inside of
[06:57:35] <Resnik> pachet: I'm using chrome
[06:58:32] <pachet> Resnik: i was asking ready
[06:59:08] <pachet> ready: well, if you have to use $(document).ready(, which i'm not convinced you do
[06:59:09] <Resnik> pachet: sry :)
[06:59:12] <pachet> you'd put it inside it
[06:59:50] <pachet> but you can just do $(function do_this_on_load(){ /* your dom-dependent stuff here */ });
[06:59:53] <pachet> same effect
[07:01:14] <Resnik> pachet: ok, now this works... but if i do it few times, it stops working, I mean it does not display whole dropdown menu 0.o
[07:02:15] <Resnik> looks like dev rly fked up this part of code :)
[07:03:16] <Resnik> it does work nice in IE tho
[07:03:41] <ready> ok pachet - i have put it inside of $(document).ready function.. and it does not work. and: your code stops the code execution.. the code after your code is not executed
[07:04:22] <pachet> ready: was it working for you in the fiddle i posted?
[07:06:16] <ready> pachet: it does not work at all
[07:06:57] <ready> same effects with firefox
[07:07:34] <ready> i have jquery 1.6.2
[07:08:07] <pachet> ready: i asked you if it was working *in the fiddle*
[07:08:22] <pachet> ready: the .on function i'm using was added in jquery 1.7
[07:10:33] <ready> ah okay.. sorry i down know what fiddle means
[07:10:40] <ready> *dont
[07:11:07] <ready> translation looks wrong
[07:11:22] <ready> ok i'll try newest jquery
[07:11:22] <pachet> jsfiddle.net
[07:11:38] <pachet> it lets you try out bits of code quickly - if you go to the link i posted and hit escape
[07:11:47] <pachet> you'll see the alert ( in chrome and firefox )
[07:12:01] <pachet> but that's only by virtue of my having specified jquery 1.7 in the fiddle settings
[07:12:11] <ready> i see
[07:12:12] <ready> sec
[07:13:34] <ready> pachet: it works in the fiddle ;)
[07:17:26] <ready> ok pachet, works now - thx alot :)

[07:51:00] <paul__> is there a delay with $.getJSON ?  I am trying to return the JSON but the var is always undefined when I read it outside of the function
[07:51:52] <shoky> paul__: read it inside the ajax callback
[07:53:09] <voot545> how do I simply add an element into a group of elements?
[07:53:29] <voot545> doh; add
[07:54:54] <wathek> is there a way to do an image vertical flip with jquery ?
[07:55:50] <paul__> ah cheers shoky.  guess I cant just treat it as an inline function then :(
[07:56:17] <shoky> paul__ that's the asynchronous nature of ajax.
[07:57:12] <shoky> you can return $.getJSON(...) from somewhere and then just keep adding callbacks with .done(function(data) { ... })  on the returned jqXHR
[08:18:44] <tkil> hi.  i'm trying to use jquery.svg, and i am having trouble manipulating actual drawing elements.  structural elements and defs can be given ids, which i can use to look things up, but it seems that drawables don't have ids. so how do i (say) delete a particular drawable?
[08:18:50] <DeltaHeavy> What's the best way to only accent numbers/decimals, while also executing a bunch of events every time a number/decimal has been added.
[08:19:03] <tkil> (and if there are better places to ask than here, please let me know, and i'll happily wander off.  am just now learning jq...)
[08:19:32] <tkil> DeltaHeavy -- watch for changes, use a regex, fire off events if regex matches?
[08:19:48] <tkil> DeltaHeavy -- ... or is that the easy part?  :)
[08:20:26] <DeltaHeavy> tkil: I can do that but it's then checking the input against other stuff at the same time. I find it doesn't register the final key and I want to avoid using a timeout.
[08:21:09] <tkil> DeltaHeavy -- "doesn't register final key" ... using keydown or keypress events?
[08:21:18] <DeltaHeavy> keypress
[08:28:24] <shoky> tkil: you can give them ids, e.g. svg.circle(100, 100, 50, { id: 'red', fill: 'red'});
[08:30:19] <paul__> cheers for the help Shoky :)  working on restructuring the JS now - this will save a lot of wasted time
[08:35:18] <tkil> fwiw, i was able to remove a drawable by using a two-level selector: svg.remove( $( "#myGroup image" ) ).  would still be nice to be able to set id / remove by id for a single drawable, but this gets me past where i was.
[08:35:36] <tkil> shoky -- huh.  i thought i tried that and it didn't work.  let me try that again.
[08:37:25] <tkil> shoky -- huh.  works fine now.  thanks!
[08:37:31] * tkil curses his heisenbugs.
[08:37:38] <shoky> ;P
[08:37:44] <M1k1> guys
[08:37:51] <M1k1> jquery 1.8 development status link :D?
[08:38:32] <tkil> shoky -- although, maybe you can help me with something else.  my float text in my svg drawing area is some sort of javascript function, and i can't get "toSVG()" to work because it seems to embed a huge amount of js / jquery stuff with it.  i think they might be related...
[08:38:38] <tkil> shoky -- ever seen this before?
[08:38:54] <shoky> M1k1 i think it's gonna be released this week (or next)
[08:39:29] <M1k1> shoky: i tested the fade in effect on 1.8b2 its still not work u not know?
[08:39:50] <tkil> huh.  and shift key makes the text box go away, so hard to get a screen shot...
[08:40:09] <shoky> M1k1: something that worked with 1.7.2?
[08:41:00] <M1k1> shoky: yes?
[08:41:37] <shoky> tkil: sorry didnt really understand the issue, and my only experience with it is helping a few people on irc ;p
[08:42:33] <M1k1> shoky: with 1.7.2 works fade in :D i just changed jquery to test but on 1.8b2 not work :X
[08:43:10] <shoky> M1k1: make a fiddle that shows it not working..
[08:43:25] <shoky> M1k1: here's a fiddle of it working http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/6bwdL/
[08:44:19] <M1k1> shoky: to me not work xD i have chomium hmm?
[08:44:39] <shoky> that fiddle doesn't fade-in the div when you click run ?
[08:44:48] <M1k1> yes
[08:45:02] <M1k1> only display content
[08:45:11] <M1k1> but not fade in..
[08:45:19] <shoky> works for me :S
[08:45:54] <M1k1> shoky: i think then have problem with browser or not know..
[08:46:46] <shoky> works for me on chrome/chrome canary/firefox/IE
[08:47:08] <M1k1> hmm then not understand xD
[08:48:43] <M1k1> shoky: if i set jquery 1.7.2 then not works too lol
[08:49:42] <shoky> M1k1: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/6bwdL/1/  this doesn't fade in/out repeatedly?
[08:49:45] <shoky> oh
[08:50:00] <shoky> then get a normal browser/OS ;P
[08:50:07] <shoky> or learn to use it :P
[08:50:13] <M1k1> not really not know what the problem xD
[08:50:23] <M1k1> ubuntu chomium :D
[08:50:58] <shoky> ;p
[08:52:59] <tkil> shoky -- here's the floating text i'm seeing: http://tkil.livejournal.com/pics/catalog/1403/5985
[08:53:55] <tkil> anyway.  currently just an inconvenience.
[08:55:28] <shoky> sry no idea

[09:33:19] <Kneferilis> Hello if you have <button>Hi</button> in your page, JQuery UI converts it into its own implementation of button?
[10:14:35] <fold> is it fair to say, "space" in jquery is similar to the "~", ">", "+" selectors?
[10:38:26] <Bheam> hey, is there a way to remove a tag, moving children up to join the new parent at the correct position? say i want to remove all '<span class="block">'
[10:38:40] <Bheam> but just the tags, not the content
[10:40:15] <Bheam> like $('SPAN.block').children.unwrap(); ?

[10:54:06] <gwinh_dev> hi all! I need help in a jquery animation.. here's a link: http://jsfiddle.net/D5xRa/1/embedded/result/ so basically, when hovering a slide, it will animate such that the hovered slide will increase in width and height while the other will have a decrease in width to exactly fit in the container. The script works well on mouseenter and mouseleave but when hovering a slide and instantly hovering
[10:54:06] <gwinh_dev> another slide without waiting for the previous to finish, the script breaks.
[10:56:58] * tw2113 makes gwinh_dev's divs dance around
[11:00:12] <exalt> which plugin works best to enable the backbutton with ajax, bbq ?
[11:11:41] <gwinh_dev> hi all!

[11:13:42] <Wolf_22> Anyone know how to get the variable type using jQuery 1.2? When I try to use $.type(), I get one of those "Function not Defined" messages in Firefox 13 and I need to use jQuery 1.2...
[11:19:31] <LekeFly> Anyone here i can hire for a few js questions? paypal..
[11:20:24] <systemfault> Benefit from the whole community if you ask on the channel..
[11:21:27] <Resnik> anyway to change this that it would only trigger on mouseover? : $(this).find("ul.sub-menu").eq(0).slideToggle(300);
[11:21:28] <LekeFly> Pretty stupid questions (very basic) i think and not all are jquery related. ^^
[11:22:12] <DarkSector> Is there a way when I drag a div having an image that the image and the div resize to a smaller size while dragging?
[11:24:02] <DarkSector> Maybe using jQuery UI, but I'd like the image to be resized too, within the div
[11:24:08] <DarkSector> Is it possible?
[11:24:53] <systemfault> DarkSector: It would probably be possible if you use a relative unit for the image or its frame
[11:24:58] <ajpiano> DarkSector: you can use a helper function and return a different element
[11:25:01] <ajpiano> to be used during dragging
[11:25:18] <DarkSector> systemfault: relative unit? Meaning?
[11:25:32] <Wolf_22> Anyone know how to get the current font-size of an element?
[11:25:48] <ajpiano> DarkSector: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#option-helper
[11:26:48] <DarkSector> ajpiano: checking it out
[11:27:35] <systemfault> DarkSector: If you use % for a "box" that contains the image and the image has max-width: 100%, your image will be "responsive"

[12:18:27] <Resnik> anyone who can help me with mouseover function?
[12:18:37] <johnkpaul> Resnik: what is the problem that you're having?
[12:19:54] <Resnik> johnkpaul: on my webpage, dropdown menu opens/closes multiple times, if I hover over it with my mouse, now i'd like to add mouseover function to "$(this).find("ul.sub-menu").eq(0).slideToggle(300);"  if it will fix the problem that is
[12:20:18] <johnkpaul> Resnik: look into .stop
[12:20:20] <johnkpaul> ?stop @ Resnik
[12:20:21] <bot-t> Resnik, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[12:21:30] <Resnik> johnkpaul: care to do an example on the line i pasted? :)
[12:21:49] <johnkpaul> Resnik: .eq(0).stop().slideToggle(300)
[12:24:42] <Einzig> Hi, I am trying to match a date like 01-01-2011  with var regex = /^\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4}$/; It doesn't match. I don't see what is wrong with the regex
[12:24:59] <Resnik> johnkpaul: does not work, now dropdown menu does not show at all
[12:25:05] <Einzig> using re.test($("#startdate").val() it seems to return false
[12:25:20] <johnkpaul> ?demo @ Resnik
[12:25:20] <bot-t> Resnik, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:26:45] <johnkpaul> Einzig: something is up with the val of the stardate element
[12:26:48] <johnkpaul> your regex is fine
[12:27:02] <johnkpaul> ?eval var regex = /^\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{4}$/;regex.test("01-01-2011");
[12:27:11] <bot-t> johnkpaul: true (Process Killed)
[12:27:20] <johnkpaul> ^ @ Einzig
[12:27:26] <Einzig> I use a datepicker
[12:27:36] <johnkpaul> so something else is wrong, not your regex
[12:27:41] <Einzig> ah
[12:27:55] <Einzig> !paste
[12:28:12] <johnkpaul> Einzig: this is #jquery not #javascript
[12:28:21] <johnkpaul> ?paste
[12:28:22] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:32:57] <Resnik> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/aaGAD/ www.zoners.org (using chrome browser)
[12:33:39] <johnkpaul> Resnik: can I have instructions on how to reproduce the issue?
[12:34:10] <Resnik> johnkpaul: just go over category menu with mouse fast multiple times
[12:34:20] <Einzig> http://pastebin.com/qYHGBzEz
[12:34:34] <Einzig> jsbin does not seem to work. strange
[12:34:48] <Einzig> ah wait
[12:34:50] <johnkpaul> Resnik: "the category menu"?
[12:34:58] <Einzig> forgot the #
[12:35:31] <johnkpaul> also, Resnik, I can't tel what the code is that does that
[12:35:35] <johnkpaul> your jsfiddle isn't functional
[12:35:57] <Resnik> johnkpaul: sec, so I restore it from previous change, atm not working at all :)
[12:36:23] <johnkpaul> Einzig: can you log the value to your console, before you test it with the regex?
[12:39:27] <Resnik> johnkpaul: ok, website back up and running, try now
[12:41:05] <johnkpaul> oh I see what's hapepning Resnik
[12:41:07] <johnkpaul> look into hoverIntent
[12:41:24] <johnkpaul> and throttling
[12:41:32] <johnkpaul> Resnik: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[12:41:37] <Resnik> sadly i'm not a code monkey :)
[12:44:24] <johnkpaul> Resnik: that usually is a good thing, as code monkey is usually derogatory
[12:44:29] <johnkpaul> so I don't know what you mean
[12:44:53] <Resnik> johnkpaul: It means I don't know how to include it, without breaking the whole thing :)
[12:45:24] <abletony84> Heya!
[12:45:32] <johnkpaul> Resnik: what do you mean include it?
[12:45:38] <abletony84> Anybody got a clue why HighCharts won't initialize on this one? http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/axX5k/
[12:45:46] <johnkpaul> Resnik: did you read that documentation?
[12:46:05] <Resnik> johnkpaul: working on that as we speak
[12:46:20] <johnkpaul> abletony84: that jsfiddle doesn't have highchrts included
[12:46:30] <abletony84> johnkpaul: sorry yeah
[12:48:07] <Goopyo> How do you get a div element out of a jquery object? I tried filter but for some reason it works on classes but not ids
[12:48:37] <Goopyo> $response = $(data); $response.filter('.class') works but $response.filter('#id') doesnt
[12:50:41] <Dreamer3> does query have a builtin for extend?
[12:50:50] <Dreamer3> yept
[12:51:14] <na3r> how to make somthing like this site http://eee.asus.com/eeepad/transformer-prime/features/?
[12:51:48] <na3r> when we scroll to element they transfer by effect
[12:54:05] <johnkpaul> ?get @ Goopyo
[12:54:06] <bot-t> Goopyo, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[12:54:12] <johnkpaul> ?extend @Dreamer3
[12:54:12] <bot-t> Dreamer3, jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[12:54:13] <Goopyo> got it used find
[12:54:25] <johnkpaul> Goopyo: find returns another jquery object
[12:55:03] <Goopyo> johnkpaul: thats fine if I want to replaceWith it?
[12:55:10] <johnkpaul> Goopyo: yes
[12:55:22] <Goopyo> to be clear like this:  $('#chat_app_box').replaceWith($response.find('#chat_app_box'));
[12:55:38] <Goopyo> johnkpaul: ^
[12:56:40] <johnkpaul> hm, Goopyo, tha'll probably work, but is confusing
[12:56:58] <Goopyo> better alternative?
[12:57:01] <Goopyo> get?
[12:57:04] <johnkpaul> try $('#chat').html($response.find('#chat').html())
[12:57:13] <Goopyo> ah
[12:57:39] <Goopyo> btw I've been using underscores everywhere in my html and jquery (used to it from python), theres nothing against that right?
[12:57:50] <Goopyo> its seems like hyphens are the more common syntax
[12:58:09] <johnkpaul> Goopyo: camelcase is much mor eprevelent
[12:58:17] <Resnik> johnkpaul: I hope i did it right: $(this).find("ul.sub-menu").eq(0).slideToggle($.throttle(1000,300)); :)
[12:58:29] <Goopyo> johnkpaul: gotcha, thanks
[12:58:31] <johnkpaul> the standard style for javascript is not underscores
[12:58:37] <johnkpaul> ?g idiomaticjs @ Goopyo
[12:58:38] <bot-t> Goopyo, rwldrn/idiomatic.js ∑ GitHub - https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js/
[12:58:47] <johnkpaul> ?tias @ Resnik
[12:58:48] <bot-t> Resnik, Try It And See
[12:59:09] <johnkpaul> Resnik: you need to throttle the mouseover hanler, not the milliseconds of slideToggle
[12:59:18] <Goopyo> hahahaha thats hillarious, shortcut for typing try it and see?
[12:59:38] <johnkpaul> Goopyo: :D yes, there are many
[13:01:15] <Resnik> still no luck for me :)
[13:03:55] <bluesm> So if I will use jQuery it will assure compatibility with IE 6 7 8 9 ?
[13:04:26] <Resnik> johnkpaul: what if i slow the whole hover function? $("#categories > ul > li ").hover(function () { ? :D
[13:04:51] <johnkpaul> bluesm: what do you mean?
[13:05:13] <johnkpaul> Resnik: did you change the code to throttle the mouseover handler, and not the slideToggle parameter?
[13:06:04] <bluesm> johnkpaul:  That I will not bother myself by searching how Microsoft create new event declarations standard ?
[13:06:21] <Resnik> johnkpaul: there is no reference to mouseover handler unless I'm missing it ? :s
[13:06:24] <johnkpaul> bluesm: yes, you do not have to use attachEvent
[13:06:45] <johnkpaul> Resnik: or hover handler? whatever event you are using to run your slideToggle code
[13:06:47] <bluesm> jquery Check the broser and then use appropriate JS function ?
[13:08:00] <johnkpaul> bluesm: not exactly, but you can think of it like that
[13:08:44] <bluesm> johnkpaul:  Ehh. I don¬¥t like this kind of answer :(
[13:08:59] <johnkpaul> bluesm: you want to understand jQuery you mean?
[13:09:03] <johnkpaul> you can read through it
[13:09:07] <johnkpaul> it does feature detection when it first loads
[13:09:09] <johnkpaul> and then it does http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=jQuery.event.add
[13:09:19] <bluesm> johnkpaul: Are you able to link me any source ?
[13:09:24] <johnkpaul> :) I just did bluesm
[13:10:07] <bluesm> Thanks!
[13:12:47] <bluesm> johnkpaul:  So it works in this way. Simply check not only for addEvent but for other function also. Of course not on every call event.add. It will be stupid :)
[13:17:46] <johnkpaul> bluesm: yes, that's right, all that logic is in there somewhere

[13:27:50] <SoleSoul> Hello! I'm new with jQuery. I have an accordion with a contenteditable ul in it. When I write stuff in the list, instead of word wrapping, the accordion becomes wider. How do I make the accordion's width stay the same and the li to word wrap? (still learning)
[13:29:09] <johnkpaul> SoleSoul: that's more of a CSS issue than jquery
[13:29:23] <SoleSoul> ok.
[13:29:44] <SoleSoul> I'll search. Thanks. (any keyword to start with?)
[13:29:45] <bluesm> Is there any compiler ~ I don
[13:29:47] <johnkpaul> you need to give the li a fixed width and word-wrap:break-word
[13:29:54] <johnkpaul> ^ @ SoleSoul
[13:30:15] <bluesm> don't know if I can name name it.
[13:30:47] <bluesm> But compiler which change JS code to jQuery funcitons ?
[13:31:17] <SoleSoul> johnkpaul: Thanks. I'm trying it.
[13:31:41] <Einzig> Is this supposed to work? Or is jquery not allowed there? <body onload="checkCookie();$("#jsdisabled").hide();">
[13:32:04] <SoleSoul> johnkpaul: Joy! it works. Thanks
[13:32:17] <johnkpaul> SoleSoul: great, no problem
[13:32:47] <johnkpaul> Einzig: it should work, but it's not a good practice
[13:32:55] <johnkpaul> ?g unobtrusive javascript @Einzig
[13:32:56] <bot-t> Einzig, Unobtrusive JavaScript - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript
[13:35:07] <Einzig> The trouble is: have to adjust someone else's website. I am progressing slowly enough as it is. Trying to make it work while ommitting js is a task too much now.
[13:35:30] <Einzig> stuck in about 4 different bugged scripts :/
[13:36:26] <AcademyIntl> Hi!  How would I go about setting the tex-tsize of a div in a ratio so the text always fits within a given width; or is there no easy way?
[13:37:27] <johnkpaul> AcademyIntl: you only care about a width restriction?
[13:37:30] <johnkpaul> then just use css
[13:37:44] <johnkpaul> the element will grow taller as necessary
[13:37:56] <AcademyIntl> johnkpaul: More like: long usersnames need to fit in chat without crapping out everything else or running over the text.
[13:38:26] <AcademyIntl> johnkpaul: Note: fake table using floated columns in row divs, so one longer name would look odd amongst the rest.
[13:38:56] <johnkpaul> AcademyIntl: display:table is probably your best option
[13:39:04] <johnkpaul> but you can write a lot of javascript to do it for you
[13:39:08] <AcademyIntl> johnkpaul: Doesn't work in .. a lot of browsers :/
[13:39:52] <johnkpaul> just ie6 and 7
[13:39:58] <johnkpaul> but depends on the job you're stuck with
[13:41:28] <AcademyIntl> johnkpaul: Currently I have .css('font-size', (120 - (msg.user.length * 4)) + '%') which seems to work for most names to fit in a 80px wide box.
[13:41:39] <AcademyIntl> johnkpaul: Just seems pretty.. non-elegent.
[13:41:58] <johnkpaul> AcademyIntl: suppirting IE6 and 7 is pretty.. non-elegant as well
[13:42:03] <johnkpaul> supporting*
[13:42:23] <johnkpaul> AcademyIntl: other than making that into a plugin, there's nothing you can do about the elegance
[13:42:30] <AcademyIntl> johnkpaul: YUP, but sadly I have to.  Guess I'll have to do this then.
[13:42:57] <AcademyIntl> johnkpaul: Now per CSS, is there a value for width: that acts as a "fill"?  (auto didn't work for some reason)
[13:43:12] <johnkpaul> 100%, but you should ask #css
[13:53:50] <bluesm> Hey.
[13:54:05] <AcademyIntl> More elegent way to do: http://jsbin.com/apipuf/edit ?
[13:54:06] <bluesm> But what about compatiblity of styles.
[13:54:19] <bluesm> If I will change them by jQuery...
[13:54:26] <bluesm> What about for example opacity ?
[13:54:27] <AcademyIntl> johnkpaul: (linkie)
[13:55:06] <johnkpaul> bluesm: depends on what property and which version of jquery
[13:55:09] <johnkpaul> in general, it's fine
[13:55:28] <bluesm> ok. The latest and opacity.
[13:55:33] <johnkpaul> AcademyIntl: to do what?
[13:55:38] <bluesm> And where I can search for that ?
[13:56:12] <AcademyIntl> johnkpaul: More elegent way to do: http://jsbin.com/apipuf/edit ?  (convert UTC timestamp to user-local timezone hh:mm:ss)
[13:56:18] <Meowth> Hey guys I'm trying to write a sort functoin that's not using ul or li tags.  What I currently have is http://pastebin.ca/2173789 but it doesn't seem to sort properly. I was wondering if anyone can lend me a hand to see where I'm failing
[13:57:23] <johnkpaul> bluesm: I don't actually know where the list is
[13:57:39] <johnkpaul> opacity is handled in jQuery 1.7 definitely, I'm pretty sure in older versions
[13:57:43] <johnkpaul> ?css @bluesm
[13:57:43] <bot-t> bluesm, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[13:57:47] <johnkpaul> that probably has more information
[13:58:02] <johnkpaul> if you read the source and search for jQuery.support.opacity, you'll see the code
[13:58:46] <johnkpaul> AcademyIntl: I don't know if there is a more elegant way to do that, but there are jquery plugins for it
[13:59:31] <johnkpaul> Meowth: jquery objects sort returns an array I believe
[13:59:46] <johnkpaul> so appendTo is an error
[14:01:31] <bluesm> Ok  Thank you, For your time :)
[14:03:27] <Meowth> johnkpaul, I ended up getting it to sort. but It only brought the header field and not the wrapper '.user'
[14:03:31] <Meowth> usr**
[14:05:48] <sunbeam> what would be the best, or top 3 jquery slider plugins? any ideas?
[14:06:11] <Meowth> johnkpaul, nvm I solved it using .parent() before the sort
[14:07:22] <johnkpaul> ah great, Meowth
[14:30:28] <theere> hey guys, i want to let users to select from a box to localize time, how do i keep a persistent box
[14:30:31] <theere> what should i look up??
[14:32:51] <AnonymousPrime> how do you mean persistent?
[14:48:53] <imsky> .
[15:00:03] <yassine> anyone of you guys using nivo slider plugin ?
[15:02:02] <nicholasschulz> is it really important to always keep <script> inside <head> ?
[15:03:42] <iheartjs> nicholasschulz: always? no, in fact it's better to avoid it when you can. Sometimes they belong up there though.
[15:04:55] <nicholasschulz> ok. i learned somewhere (don't remember where) that i should keep them inside the <head> tags at all cost‚Ä¶. not very practical
[15:05:06] <nicholasschulz> thanks iheartjs ! :-)
[15:39:37] <nessaja> Hey LindsayMac
[15:54:31] <wathek> is this type of selector wrong: div.zone[data-type='image']
[15:54:41] <sku11knight> hey guys, I'm kind of stumped on how to get this jquery script to work for dynamically generated css id's. here's the code http://pastebin.com/71NJNuhe
[15:56:10] <Cameron_> i have an ajax function that then assigns a click function to the processed html, how can i get the class of the clicked elemet?
[15:56:23] <Cameron_> i tried this.attr('class') but its going to the ajax as "this"
[15:58:22] <starsinmypockets> How do I get, for instance, th third <li element> using a jquery selector?
[15:59:11] <tw2113> ?nth-child @ starsinmypockets
[15:59:12] <bot-t> starsinmypockets, :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[15:59:27] <starsinmypockets> Ahh thanks
[15:59:39] <Cameron_> Uncaught TypeError: Object http://localhost/NavHawk/index.php/router# has no method 'attr'
[15:59:43] <Cameron_> thats what it says
[15:59:50] <Cameron_> in the console
[16:01:56] <martisj> morning
[16:03:43] <Cameron_> gargh
[16:03:45] <Cameron_> someone please help
[16:13:40] <veebers> Cameron_: I think you'll need $(this).attr('class')
[16:13:49] <Cameron_> yeah
[16:13:51] <Cameron_> you're right
[16:13:53] <Cameron_> thanks!!
[16:15:52] <veebers> Cameron_: np
[16:17:14] <veebers> Cameron_: for completeness: it's because attr() is a jquery method, 'this' (in this context) isn't a jquery object so we make it one by using $()
[16:17:47] <Cameron_> ah okay, never wouldve thought of that, it was just a stab in the dark hah

[18:25:10] <sku11knight> hi guys, i can't really figure out why this won't work past the first click. any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/sqhgh/4/
[18:35:04] <klocatelli> sku11knight, why would it? you're checking $hide to see whether you should hide or expand paccordian
[18:35:11] <klocatelli> but you assign $hide right there!
[18:35:30] <klocatelli> you need a variable outside the scope of the function, otherwise it gets destroyed every time
[18:36:12] <klocatelli> eg http://jsfiddle.net/GMtTq/
[18:36:28] <sku11knight> i'm an idiot. sorry.
[18:37:26] <sku11knight> works like a charm klocatelli. thank you again
[18:37:33] <sku11knight> or for the first time actually : P
[18:37:33] <klocatelli> no problem :)
[18:45:14] <djbpython> anyone use jquery mobile? having a tough time setting a background image for my pages
[18:45:41] <azbyin> hi all.. $("input[type=text]:last").focus()  does not work
[18:45:57] <azbyin> i.e. i don't see the text field coming into focus
[18:46:20] <azbyin> i have tried it in chrome and ff. will post fiddle now
[18:51:36] <HarryPitfall> there is channel to talk about some jQuery / jQuery.UI plugins?
[18:52:08] <HarryPitfall> currently, I want to share and get help about Flexigrid
[18:53:35] <tw2113> wouldn't that be here?
[18:58:42] <tyoc213> buttons isn't working on jqueryui dialog as spected....
[18:59:22] <tyoc213> even on the simple example, but I dont get errors
[19:01:13] <misc--> hi all, if I have the following html: <input type='checkbox' name='matches[Accounts][abc]'> and another... <input type='checkbox' name='matches[Contacts][def]'> ... etc - how can I loop over this array with foreach, without referencing "Accounts" or "Contacts"
[19:01:59] <misc--> I need to references "matches" only, because it's a hash and I won't know what's in this hash, but I need to iterate over 'matches', printing both the first element (Accounts/Contacts/etc) and then looping over each of them
[19:02:23] <coldhead> $('input[name^="matches"]').each(...)
[19:02:46] <azbyin> ah, my bad. it works in the fiddle because i didn;t have firebug open
[19:02:48] <coldhead> and then use a regex to extract the keys on $(this).attr('name')
[19:02:53] <misc--> I hope that makes sense? I know how to iterate over all checkboxes, but this doesn't give me the Accounts/Contacts part - it just gives me the values in the 2nd part of the array
[19:03:01] <misc--> oh
[19:03:18] <misc--> coldhead: ok I'll give that a shot, thanks
[19:03:26] <coldhead> if you get stuck do a working demo at jsfiddle and we'll help you get it working, misc--
[19:03:43] <azbyin> when i had firebug open and was trying to focus the textfield by typing $("input[type='text']:last").focus() it didn;t work because the firebug console was keeping focus
[19:03:53] <misc--> thanks! I had about 30 tabs open in firefox trying to research it but it seems it's not too common (I thought it would be)
[19:06:38] <coldhead> misc--: here's the docs for selecting via attributes http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[19:08:07] <azbyin> any of you guys done animated text input into a text field?
[19:08:23] <misc--> coldhead: ok thanks. The part I was having issues with was actually referencing the "matches" part only... once I had that then I think I could have looped over it. Anyway I'll try  your section but looks like somebody has overwritten my code so need to fix a couple things first before I try again
[19:08:45] <misc--> oops I mean I'll try your code (not section)
[19:09:29] <coldhead> good luck buddy
[19:09:43] <misc--> thanks =)
[19:21:20] <azbyin> is there a better way to add new text to the existing text in an input field than: $("#myfld").val($("#myfld").val() + " \o/")  ?
[19:22:49] <azbyin> because in plain js, i can simply do: myfld.value += " \o/";
[19:23:32] <misc--> coldhead: Thanks, that worked! Don't really like the idea of using a regexp to get the element names but it will definitely accomplish the same thing. Thanks again
[19:23:52] <coldhead> how else would you get them if not by regex?
[19:24:13] <coldhead> the format is regular, it's what regexes are meant for :)
[19:24:20] <LindsayMac> someone call my name?
[19:24:26] <tw2113> i moaned it
[19:24:44] <LindsayMac> lol tyoc213
[19:24:58] <azbyin> lol Lindrian
[19:25:04] <azbyin> oh my!
[19:25:49] <LindsayMac> tw2113:  gr
[19:26:03] * LindsayMac waiting for someone to say happy bday 
[19:26:27] <tw2113> herpy barfday
[19:26:41] <misc--> well, I thought you could do a foreach over matches like, $('input[name^="matches"]').each(function key) { key.each(function value) { print "key is " + key (refers to "Accounts") + " val is " + val (refers to first id of Accounts .... etc (incorrect syntax, but that's what I thought you could do)
[19:26:43] <coldhead> hey happy birthday, LindsayMac
[19:26:54] <LindsayMac> YAY! thanks coldhead
[19:27:15] <misc--> like how you can in other languages... if you have an assoc array you can just loop over that with foreach or something and get the key/val pair
[19:27:44] <coldhead> you can't do that here, misc--, because jQuery doesn't know that the attributes are hashes
[19:27:53] <coldhead> you need to extract them manually
[19:27:56] <misc--> the difference here though is that "key" refers to the name too... hmm, thinking about it, it probably makes sense with what it's doing
[19:28:00] <HarryPitfall> about the check boxes
[19:28:01] <misc--> yeah
[19:28:02] <tyoc213> LindsayMac: zup?
[19:28:07] <HarryPitfall> use a custom class
[19:28:09] <coldhead> and regular expressions are i'd do it
[19:28:18] <LindsayMac> tyoc213:  oops.. used the wrong username. SORRY
[19:28:20] <HarryPitfall> class="checkgroup"
[19:28:27] <HarryPitfall> $('.checkgroup')
[19:28:45] <misc--> ahhhh yes that's another way.. didn't think of that
[19:28:45] <HarryPitfall> and for the sensitive information, use the html5 data
[19:28:53] <HarryPitfall> data-fieldname="xxx"
[19:29:02] <HarryPitfall> and use .prop('data-fieldname')
[19:29:43] <HarryPitfall> <input type="checkbox" class="checkgroup" data-fieldname="accounts" ... />
[19:29:49] <tyoc213> LindsayMac: :P
[19:30:01] <HarryPitfall> the data-xxxx is permitted on html5 specs
[19:30:10] <misc--> I like that way
[19:30:38] <HarryPitfall> i remember that the next version of jquery will 'automatic' import data- attributes into the .data()
[19:30:53] <misc--> I was wondering about that, if you could just through in any field name in html to see if it works... apparently it does
[19:30:58] <HarryPitfall> so, in next version, a tag with data-xxx can be read using .data('xxx')
[19:31:08] <misc--> oh I see
[19:31:30] <HarryPitfall> you can use anythings as attribute
[19:31:36] <HarryPitfall> but isn't html compliant
[19:31:43] <HarryPitfall> well... xhtml compliant
[19:31:52] <misc--> but it is html5 complient?
[19:32:06] <HarryPitfall> attributes starting with "data-" will be
[19:32:10] <HarryPitfall> user attributes
[19:32:20] <misc--> ahh ok so they have to start with data-. OK then
[19:36:36] <HarryPitfall> just to inform
[19:36:47] <HarryPitfall> jQuery 1.4.3+ already do the data trick
[19:37:36] <HarryPitfall> if you have <div id="a" data-info="something">, you can just do $('#a').data('info')
[19:38:00] <HarryPitfall> the value is 'parsed' as json

[21:14:22] <Andweeeee> Hi everybody, I'm kind of new to jquery and I have a question but my googlefu must be pretty weak. how would one animate a change in class? I feel weird using jquery to set css values‚Ä¶
[21:15:52] <Andweeeee> like‚Ä¶say if i want to change the opacity of an element. normally I'd
[21:15:52] <Andweeeee> $('element').animate({opacity:0},'slow');
[21:16:22] <Whirl3d> you could use jqueryUI and $(element).addClass("hidden", 'slow');
[21:17:57] <Andweeeee> so you can do that with jqueryUI?! Can you do stuff like change colors slowly, perchance? I know you can't with just jquery...
[21:18:18] <Whirl3d> I believe so, yes.
[21:18:20] <Andweeeee> Whirl3d you my boy.
[21:18:30] <Andweeeee> Thank you, kind sir or madame.
[21:18:56] <Whirl3d> http://jqueryui.com/demos/animate/
[21:19:29] <Andweeeee> you rule.
[21:50:35] <Andweeeee> ok, related question. can more complex css properties be animated as they change? I'm trying to animate a change in box-shadow on a click event:
[21:50:35] <Andweeeee> $(function(){
[21:50:35] <Andweeeee>       $('div#albumArt').click(function()    {
[21:50:35] <Andweeeee>             $('#albumArt').toggleClass('workTypesSelected', 1000);
[21:50:35] <Andweeeee>             return false;
[21:50:35] <Andweeeee>       });
[21:50:35] <Andweeeee> css: .workTypesSelected {-webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 0px black;}
[21:50:36] <Andweeeee> what keeps happening is that the toggle works, but there's no easing‚Ä¶it's just a delayed toggle.
[21:57:42] <Andweeeee> I feel like there has to be a way to do that‚Ä¶since the width an height properties can also be changed incrementally, doesn't that mean that any property with a number value can be animated‚Äîas long as it's being animated to another number value?
[21:58:26] <Whirl3d> Andweeeee, please don't paste your code in the channel like that. It's best to go to jsfiddle.net, setup your code (with html, css, and js) and then share the url back here.
[21:58:45] <Andweeeee> oh, im sorry. ok i'll do that.
[21:59:07] <cheesypoof20> Maybe take a look at http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/shadow-animation/
[21:59:20] <Whirl3d> Make sure to select the appropriate framework on the left and then also make sure to click save/update
[22:00:54] <cheesypoof20> Anybody have a strategy/method that I can use to make the 'extra' options work in this: http://jsfiddle.net/Pr54Q/8/
[22:10:02] <Andweeeee> cheesypoof20 I'm by no means an expert, but it doesn't look like you're doing anything to add the attributes together
[22:11:35] <cheesypoof20> I know that, the last two selects are simply there so someone can visualize what I am trying to accomplish.
[22:12:18] <Andweeeee> oh ok. sorry, I'm trying to code it, but like previously stated, I'm no expert.
[22:14:17] <Whirl3d> cheespoof20, I just can't quite get the numbers to look pretty, but this is what you want:
[22:14:39] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Pr54Q/13/
[22:15:39] <cheesypoof20> I'm no expert either Andweeeee. :)
[22:15:51] <cheesypoof20> Thank you Whirl3d, I'll take a look.
[22:17:46] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Pr54Q/19/
[22:17:53] <Whirl3d> toFixed(2) does it
[22:17:53] <tw2113> jsbin.com is looking hot these days
[22:20:12] <Andweeeee> http://jsfiddle.net/sjjuz/4/
[22:22:11] <Whirl3d> to animate drop shadows, you'll need a plugin like http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/shadow-animation/ like cheesypoof20 mentioned
[22:23:01] <cheesypoof20> its unfortunate that css transitions can't animate box-shadow :\
[22:24:00] <cheesypoof20> Whirl3d, in: price+=parseFloat($(this).val(),2) what is the ",2" for?
[22:24:10] <tw2113> give them time
[22:25:26] <coldhead> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat
[22:25:40] <coldhead> apparently it's for nothing
[22:25:58] <coldhead> maybe someone imagines it's the number of decimal places
[22:27:40] <Andweeeee> oh man. my bad I've been working on the nuts and bolts problem and failing hard
[22:27:46] <Andweeeee> this is fun, though.
[22:27:52] <Whirl3d> hmmm, I thought for sure the 2 was the number of decimal places. Good to know. It *should* be the number of decimal places, though.
[22:30:10] <coldhead> javascript isn't great at number formating
[22:30:13] <coldhead> or text processing
[22:30:19] <coldhead> or anything else you might ever need it for >: |
[22:30:48] <Andweeeee> lol
[22:32:37] <cheesypoof20> Thanks Whirl3d, this should work just great.
[22:41:02] <Andweeeee> lol I dun goofed. http://jsfiddle.net/Pr54Q/21/
[22:41:23] <Andweeeee> err. http://jsfiddle.net/Pr54Q/22/
[22:41:39] <cheesypoof20> LOL
[22:42:55] <Andweeeee> hey man, i tried. i reallly. whew. i have no idea what is going on.
[22:43:12] <Andweeeee> this is way better than playing videogames.
[22:43:57] <amh345> i've got a bit of a conflict when replacing an image attr source.   i've got $('TABLE img').attr replace replacing src from a defined path.  but within the table i have a img with a class name that needs a different src than what's in TABLE img.
[22:44:33] <amh345> but what's happening is TABLE img is also replacing the source of the class.  is there a way to prevent the source from replacing that one img class?
[22:46:51] <krz> how does one color a specific text in a textarea?
[22:48:14] <cheesypoof20> It's very difficult to understand your explanation amh345. I'm sure someone could help you if you created an example: http://jsfiddle.net/
[22:48:26] <amh345> im setting a jsfiddle up now
[22:48:46] <coldhead> i am sniffing glue
[22:49:21] <amh345> cheesypoof20:   ok here it is. http://jsfiddle.net/Zfv2S/    if you check the src of the image_btn class you'll see what happens
[22:49:39] <amh345> it makes sense that would happen. i just need to figure out how to get around it
[22:50:19] <azbyin> amh345, why not do it in the opposite order?
[22:50:32] <azbyin> set the table img attr first and then set the class src ?
[22:50:33] <amh345> i tried that in my app and it didnt make a difference.
[22:50:44] <amh345> you mean like flip the js code?
[22:50:47] <azbyin> yeah
[22:51:00] <amh345> didnt make a diff unfortunately
[22:51:32] <amh345> it doesnt make a difference in the jsfiddle either.
[22:51:51] <amh345> if im upstanding correctly http://jsfiddle.net/Zfv2S/1/
[22:53:04] <cheesypoof20> is the markup always going to look like this, the .image_btn is always going to be in the second td?
[22:53:20] <azbyin> cheesypoof20, thats a bad assumption
[22:53:51] <cheesypoof20> no kidding, thats why I asked
[22:54:46] <amh345> cheesypoof20: it might not always be in that order
[22:54:56] <amh345> i mean, i cant see it changing. but you never know
[22:55:34] <amh345> actually. i goofed on the jsfiddle.
[22:55:56] <amh345> the <img> will always be inside a <p class="add_to_cart"> tag
[22:56:27] <amh345> but it could be nested, heavily.
[22:59:27] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[22:59:29] <cheesypoof20> http://jsfiddle.net/Zfv2S/2/
[23:00:05] <amh345> this is more the structure
[23:00:06] <amh345> http://jsfiddle.net/Zfv2S/3/
[23:00:25] <amh345> oh nice. thanks cheesypoof20. i will try that.
[23:00:49] <Andweeeee> coldhead providing the comedy relief. i appreciate that.
[23:01:04] <amh345> cheesypoof20: that worked. thank you
[23:01:11] <cheesypoof20> sure thing :)
[23:01:53] <amh345> .not method.  makes a lot of sense.
[23:20:08] <krz> i have a text area. that has a default text called "#awesome". it is colored #999. i need the default text to stay on the right side of the cursor whenever the user types. how should i go about this?
[23:21:22] <coldhead> you don't have that level of control over text in an input
[23:21:33] <coldhead> you'll have to put the text in a div positioned over the top
[23:21:54] <coldhead> and possibly catch any click events and pass them through to the input
[23:23:18] <Ou42> I found a webpage that demo'd all the ease functions for animate method, but couldn't find one that ping-ponged. is there one?
[23:23:58] <krz> coldhead: something like this: http://imagebin.org/221801
[23:24:14] <krz> the tricky part is how to color the #awesome text
[23:26:22] <coldhead> my point remains, you don't have that level of control over text in an input
[23:30:30] <cheesypoof20> I've never used the 'contenteditable' attribute before, but you may want to investigate this krz.
[23:36:59] <lng> hi! I have trouble of sending hex number with .ajax() - 'data: {Hash:Hash},'. the pages is reloaded and error couldn't be tracked...
[23:38:27] <lng> but why is it failing on string like that - 37ea4e722c82d465eb99b726ea831bed9dc4b2ef26ba6e45953e73080d2a7ffc ?
[23:39:41] <coldhead> can we see the code, lng?
[23:41:33] <lng> http://codepad.org/dpAQR9og
[23:41:36] <lng> coldhead: ^
[23:41:45] <lng> I think it's because of JSON
[23:46:11] <coldhead> lng: i don't think you need those quotes
[23:46:19] <coldhead> Hash: Hash should suffice
[23:48:25] <lng> coldhead: If no quotes, it is failing
[23:49:24] <Andweeeee> can someone please tell me why the hell this div is bouncing? Also,  why is it that when you click it the first time it does nothing?
[23:49:25] <Andweeeee> http://jsfiddle.net/sjjuz/8/
[23:51:12] <juha_> Andweeeee: add .stop(1,1) to the code
[23:53:36] <Andweeeee> wait, what? where?
[23:55:52] <krz> anyone know how things can be achieved? http://imagebin.org/221801
[23:56:36] <juha_> Andweeeee: $('div#albumArt').click(function()    { $(this).stop(1,1); /* rest of the code*/
[23:56:50] <juha_> might work, not sure
[23:57:31] <tw2113> krz [01:26am] <coldhead> my point remains, you don't have that level of control over text in an input
[23:57:36] <coldhead> failing how, lng
[23:58:22] <krz> tw2113: thats a very good point he made. so i need an alternative
[23:58:26] <krz> options people
[23:58:56] <tw2113> and i question why this is needed
[23:59:27] <krz> tw2113: because it is?
[23:59:35] <tw2113> no
[23:59:37] <krz> who gives a rats ass why it is needed
[23:59:42] <krz> its a requirement
[23:59:48] <tw2113> and i'm asking why
