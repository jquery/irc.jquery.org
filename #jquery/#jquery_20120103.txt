[00:22:37] <Cork> SrPx: looks like its changed somewhere quite reasently
[00:23:00] <Cork> SrPx: but ya, i can repro it in multible browsers here; but i know i didn't use to work like this...
[00:23:26] <SrPx> Cork: yea strange, so i dont see any difference on keypress and keydown now
[00:23:30] <SrPx> maybe its a bug
[00:25:22] <Cork> SrPx: nope, it was normalized in html5
[00:25:39] <SrPx> ?
[00:26:40] <Cork> SrPx: ie has always done it, other browser hasn
[00:26:43] <Cork> +'t
[00:27:05] <motaka2> how to get current time in miliseconds
[00:27:07] <motaka2> ?
[00:27:08] <Cork> the spec has changed to normalize the event model, so now all browser does

[00:32:35] <aro> is there a way to allow navigation to jqueryui tabs
[00:32:46] <gnarf> aro: what do you mean?
[00:33:00] <aro> well, like so you can bookmark a page with an open tab
[00:33:13] <gnarf> aro: yeah, one of the options i think, lemme check
[00:33:48] <aro> okay thanks.. i looked but i couldnt figur eout what one it was
[00:35:13] <motaka2> i want an input to send ajax requests after each several alphabet being typed not just one ? I mean i want to replace keyup
[00:35:34] <aro> motaka2: use debounce
[00:35:45] <gnarf> aro: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/default.html#tabs-3
[00:35:46] <motaka2> ok lemme search
[00:35:52] <gnarf> it just works if you have an ID on the <a>
[00:35:53] <gnarf> it seems
[00:35:56] <brodoser_> hey guys
[00:36:28] <aro> how come the page url doesnt change when you click other tabs?
[00:36:29] <motaka2> aro: is there not a simpler way ?
[00:36:44] <aro> motaka2: figure out an easier way and tell us
[00:37:10] <brodoser_> how would i use jquery to disable a submit/button until text is entered in another field?
[00:37:48] <motaka2> aro: jquery doesnt have a function ?
[00:37:51] <gnarf> aro: not really sure but you could probably hook the select event and do it
[00:38:16] <gnarf> motaka2: not really something that jQuery core needs, ben alman has a nice debounce/throttle
[00:38:24] <gnarf> ?g ben alman debounce throttle
[00:38:25] <bot-t> gnarf, Ben Alman » jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[00:38:43] <brodoser_> so i want to disable $('.add-group-btn') at first, but once someones enters text into $('.add-group-input') i want to enable the former, make sense?
[00:39:03] <brodoser_> <3 jquery
[00:40:19] <gnarf> brodoser_: var buttons = $('.add-group-btn').addClass('ui-state-disabled'); $('.add-group-input').keyup( function( event ) { buttons.toggleClass( 'ui-state-disabled', this.value.length > 0 ) });
[00:43:22] <brodoser_> gnarf: gdamn thanks man. i think that will def help
[00:43:26] <brodoser_> where you from?
[00:44:27] <gnarf> illinois
[00:45:24] <brodoser_> nice, kinda figured you were european since you gave a cogent answer at 12:45am pst..
[00:45:42] <brodoser_> thanks though, im in seattle
[00:48:03] <brodoser_> gnarf: i noticed you used the keyup function, wouldn't .blur()   be better in this situation?
[00:49:28] <gnarf> brodoser_: doesn't make a huge difference, keyup will enable the input immediately after they type, blur will wait until the input loses focus
[00:52:03] <brodoser_> gnarf: wow thanks, i wasn't aware of keyup, i'll probably start using this now
[00:53:09] <brodoser_> gnarf: where in IL you from?
[00:53:21] <gnarf> few hours from chicago
[00:53:56] <motaka2> aro: what do you think of this code?
[00:53:58] <motaka2> http://pastebin.com/kggqMmm4
[00:54:14] <brodoser_> nice i got some family out there, streamwood, napersville, bartlett etc
[00:55:17] <gnarf> motaka2: just use ben's debounce
[00:55:41] <motaka2> gnarf: whats the problem with that one?
[00:55:49] <gnarf> you got issues there - say someone types an "a" the suggest pops up, then they type 'bc' and nothing happens, then nothing happens
[00:56:11] <gnarf> the suggest never gets updated with abc
[00:56:39] <gnarf> if you use a "debounced" function, it behaves slightly different than that
[00:56:55] <gnarf> the trick with debounce is you set a timeout to execute a function x ms after the last event
[00:57:13] <gnarf> but like, ben has it all wrapped up in a tidy plugin

[01:20:59] <abhaya> hello
[01:21:50] <_|Nix|_> Hi! Is there a way of retrieving whether a widget has been created out of a given element? I see that the widget is stored under a .data() item named after the widget class, but the data item is just an object, no different from any other object that may or may not be set on this element via $.data ...
[01:22:10] <abhaya> thaha chaina malai
[01:22:54] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: um... you wanna know if ANY widget, or a particular one?
[01:23:06] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: any
[01:24:15] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: thats a lil complicated
[01:24:24] <gnarf> but all widgets have a "widgetName" property
[01:24:30] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: When I print out the data stored under the element like so: $.each($.data(elem), function(key, value) { console.log(value); })); google-chrome gives me $.widget.$.(anonymous function).(anonymous function) for the widget, and Object for everything else ...
[01:24:41] <gnarf> so you could check all the obects on .data() for a "widgetName" property
[01:25:03] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: That's true! I'd forgotten about that ... not bad ...
[01:25:23] <gnarf> they will also have a "widget" method
[01:25:53] <gnarf> so you could check that typeof data[eachKey].widget  === 'function'
[01:26:42] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Yeah, I guess if it fits the pattern, chances are it's a widget, eh?
[01:27:35] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: duck typing for the win
[01:27:50] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: :) LOL
[01:28:33] <udp> is it me or are the `pageX` and `pageY` properties missing from mouse events in 1.7.x?
[01:29:05] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: ... although I do wish I could figure out how Google chrome calculates that string $.widget.(anonymous function).(anonymous function) ... the $.widget portion would almost certainly be a dead givaway ...
[01:29:07] <gnarf> udp: pageX and pageY are long deprecated
[01:29:20] <gnarf> udp: if you want to look for them, they may still be on .originalEvent
[01:29:24] <gnarf> but we stopped copying them
[01:29:27] <gnarf> in 1.7
[01:29:30] <udp> ah - it's a plugin I'm using that's reading them
[01:30:12] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: OTOH, if I do figure it out, I might end up with some Chrome-specific code ...
[01:32:13] <talin_> hello and spello. i have a table with a bunch of text inputs in a form. i want to be able to click e.g. a "+" and then get an additional text input field
[01:32:17] <talin_> is that possible?
[01:32:19] <udp> gnarf: I can't see any other coordinates in the event - it's `dragstart`
[01:32:31] <talin_> i want to be able to click + and get new fields up until i have a total of e.g. 5
[01:32:39] <gnarf> udp: have you looked on originalEvent ?
[01:32:43] <talin_> but maybe the only way is to show/hide a div that gives me either just 1 or all 5?
[01:32:46] <udp> they are indeed in originalevent, but I'm reluctant to have it read that
[01:33:10] <gnarf> udp: dragstart probably isn't a "mouse event" in the 1.7 internals
[01:36:54] <ukim> <gnarf> solved. My mistake
[01:39:14] <gnarf> udp: there's nothing wrong with using originalEvent
[01:39:20] <gnarf> just know that its not "normalized"
[01:41:33] <gnarf> udp: i'm not really sure how
[01:41:43] <krambiorix> hi guys, in a jquery plugin i want to get an element on the html page: $('testdiv').innerHTML  -> but this is undefined... Howcome?
[01:42:53] <gnarf> but you might be able to do jQuery.event.fixHooks[ "dragstart" ] = jQuery.event.mouseHooks
[01:43:24] <gnarf> ukim: that should make dragstart copy the event stuff over
[01:43:40] <gnarf> and normalize pageX pageY
[01:44:45] <p3rsist> Hi guys. How can I know if the jquery selector has found the dom element? Does it return null or underfined?
[01:44:50] <p3rsist> if it hasnt found it?
[01:45:02] <gnarf> p3rsist: .length will be 0
[01:45:20] <p3rsist> AIght. Thanks gnarf
[01:48:13] <udp> gnarf: thanks, I think I'll just use originalEvent for now.  I wonder why dragStart isn't considered a mouse event any more?
[01:48:34] <gnarf> udp: jquery doesn't normalize dragstart
[01:50:29] <krambiorix> gnarf, in a jquery plugin i want to get an element on the html page: $('testdiv').innerHTML  -> but this is undefined... Howcome?
[01:50:50] <gnarf> ?html @krambiorix
[01:50:50] <bot-t> krambiorix, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[01:51:20] <udp> krambiorix: you probably also meant $('#testdiv') or $('.testdiv')
[01:52:13] <udp> krambiorix: so something like $('#testdiv').html() if the id is testdiv, or $('div.testdiv').html() if the class is testdiv
[01:52:44] <krambiorix> udp, thx, i forgot the # in my paste
[01:56:33] <krambiorix> gnarf, udp, actually i want to check if a hyperlink is being clicked, now i try: $('#testlink').bind('click', function(ev) { -> but this doesn't work even when the hyperlink with id testlink is being clicked
[01:57:05] <udp> krambiorix: make sure you bind it when the DOM is ready
[01:58:53] <udp> krambiorix: $(function () { /* DOM is ready */   $('#testlink').click (function () {   /* link clicked */   }) });
[01:59:22] <krambiorix> udp the dom is ready
[02:00:08] <udp> krambiorix: show me the page?
[02:02:58] <krambiorix> udp its more than 2000 lines
[02:03:37] <udp> then the problem is probably somewhere else than jquery's click event
[02:03:59] <udp> can't you isolate it in a new page?
[02:04:41] <krambiorix> udp , hmm, can i just paste the function?
[02:05:31] <udp> sure

[02:08:36] <krambiorix> udp: http://jsfiddle.net/kuHpu/
[02:09:13] <lrvick> anyoen know why jquery ui moves a dialog box from <body> way down into a child element? It is causing problems because it is putting the dialog box dom in a relative element, therefore making all the positioning be relative to that item
[02:09:45] <lrvick> http://new.lrvick.net/js/jQuery-EmbedPicasaGallery/demo.html
[02:10:05] <gnarf> lrvick: dialog uses its own css framework, it wraps whatever div you give it in the ui-dialog stuff
[02:10:58] <udp> krambiorix: you'll need some HTML in there if it's to do anything - you just used it as a pastebin :p  I'll have a look anyway
[02:11:43] <krambiorix> udp, all html is created by jquery ... The line is : $('#plakken').one('mouseup', function(ev) {
[02:11:45] <lrvick> gnarf: i know this, however my dialog element is located just under the <body> tag in the dom before i call $myel.dialog()
[02:11:57] <lrvick> gnarf: however for some reason it is _moving_ the element
[02:12:05] <lrvick> to a deep child in the page structure
[02:12:08] <lrvick> before rendering
[02:12:20] <gnarf> lrvick: it puts it inside of a div.ui-dialog
[02:12:30] <gnarf> lrvick: thats what its supposed to do
[02:12:51] <gnarf> div.ui-dialog, with a div.ui-titlebar, and a div.ui-dialog-content
[02:13:05] <udp> krambiorix: this code doesn't really say much out of context.  can you try to isolate the problem in something live I can debug for you?
[02:13:18] <lrvick> you misunderstand. it does not just put it in a container. it actually relocates my dialong element
[02:13:24] <lrvick> and draws it inside a child somewhere else
[02:13:32] <lrvick> at a different location in the dom tree
[02:13:42] <lrvick> which makes the css break
[02:13:46] <lrvick> since its trying to do absolute positning
[02:13:50] <lrvick> inside a reletive element
[02:14:00] <lrvick> instead of inside body where i put it
[02:14:28] <gnarf> lrvick: let ui-dialog handle the positioning
[02:14:38] <gnarf> you're putting your css on the wrong element if you're trying to position the dialog
[02:14:48] <lrvick> i am not using anything but stick css
[02:14:51] <lrvick> no custom css at all
[02:14:52] <lrvick> check the page
[02:14:56] <lrvick> stock*
[02:15:20] <lrvick> but due to the fact that the element is being drawn inside a child, its positining is relative to that child
[02:15:24] <lrvick> therefore way off
[02:15:39] <gnarf> lrvick: whatever you pass to .dialog, its wrapped in css
[02:15:57] <gnarf> like - thats what it does
[02:16:03] <lrvick> yes thats fine
[02:16:06] <Evil_Pigeon> the #gallery div looks to be positioned in the body. Where are you thinking it's positioned?
[02:16:14] <lrvick> if it left the element where i put it, and wrapped it in css there, iw doult be fine
[02:16:42] <gnarf> lrvick: dialog wraps the element in the ui-dialog and appends it to the bottom of the body
[02:16:45] <gnarf> thats what dialog does
[02:17:25] <lrvick> yes it puts it at the very bottom of the body, i was incorrect. it moves it from the top to the bottom
[02:17:34] <lrvick> for some reaosn hwoever the positioning is way off
[02:17:40] <lrvick> its relative to the content
[02:17:54] <lrvick> its behaving like a block element
[02:18:26] <lrvick> you cna view source on that demo and see im not using any custom css at all.
[02:19:18] <lrvick> yeah i can edit the top and left valeus in the dom in webkit inspector and _make_ it right
[02:19:24] <lrvick> they are just way off for some reason
[02:19:29] <lrvick> that seems to be the only real problem
[02:19:48] <krambiorix> udp, i can't make it into a working thing online...
[02:20:21] <krambiorix> udp, i can paste some other functions but i don't think that'll add a value
[02:21:24] <gnarf> lrvick: it seems only the first one in off in positioning
[02:21:56] <lrvick> naw the x and y are both way off on my end.
[02:22:01] <lrvick> top/left *
[02:22:24] <gnarf> hit escape, and open another one
[02:22:46] <lrvick> they all load in the exact same position
[02:23:07] <gnarf> lrvick: not for me
[02:23:09] <gnarf> lrvick: also
[02:23:19] <mindis|wurk> hi. anyone ever pass newlines from textarea content to server via getjson? they seem to disappear for me
[02:23:27] <gnarf> lrvick: might it have something to do with the fact that the <img> tag hasn't loaded a width/height yet?
[02:23:56] <lrvick> gnarf: http://dumpon.us/526/
[02:24:05] <xwurf> hi, i have a question. i want to set a cgridview-filter-field via jquery and immediately after i want to update the cgridview
[02:24:06] <lrvick> is how they all look on my end
[02:24:40] <gnarf> lrvick: browser?
[02:24:42] <gnarf> im using chrome
[02:24:47] <xwurf>   	$('input[name=myfield]').val("valuetofilter");                         $.fn.yiiGridView.update('mygridview');
[02:24:59] <lrvick> chrome 16
[02:25:12] <gnarf> lrvick: i'm pretty sure your problem is that the <img> you're appending doesn't have a width/height until after its displayed
[02:25:13] <xwurf> now, the value of the input field is set correctly but the update of the cgridview is done without the new value of the inputfield and after update the input field is empty
[02:25:30] <lrvick> gnarf: is there any way to avoid that?
[02:25:33] <gnarf> so like the "auto centering" is putting it in the middle of the page as an empty dialog
[02:25:46] <gnarf> lrvick: kind of
[02:25:49] <gnarf> ?imagesloaded
[02:25:49] <bot-t> imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[02:26:03] <xwurf> so, anyone know why gridview-update does not take the value of the line of code before?
[02:26:25] <xwurf> the both statements are executed on an "onClick"-event
[02:26:28] <gnarf> lrvick: after you create the <img> tag, wait for the "load" event before you pop the dialog
[02:27:21] <lrvick> how would i do that?
[02:27:54] <gnarf> lrvick: really? .bind("load", function( event ) { makeTheDialogHappen(); });
[02:27:55] <gnarf> ?
[02:28:01] <gnarf> https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded/blob/master/jquery.imagesloaded.js
[02:28:55] <lrvick> gnarf: http://pae.st/qbeV/raw
[02:29:16] <lrvick> is gnarf oh nice. ive never used load
[02:29:38] <gnarf> you want to bind to the load event before you set the src on the image
[02:29:41] <gnarf> so like
[02:30:47] <gnarf> $("<img>".bind("load", function() { if ( this.src === image.content.src ) $dialog.dialog(...); }).appendTo($dialog).attr("src", image.content.src);
[02:31:38] <gnarf> if you have strangeness with the load event not firing
[02:31:46] <gnarf> take a look at using that data-url src too
[02:32:07] <lrvick> wait not $("<img>").bind ?
[02:32:13] <lrvick> or was that a typo
[02:32:16] <gnarf> lrvick: just missed a )
[02:32:17] <gnarf> obviously
[02:33:14] <lrvick> woo!
[02:33:15] <lrvick> it works now!
[02:33:19] * lrvick hugs gnarf
[02:39:09] <JohnHo> nice bind

[02:41:14] <EdwardIII> if i include something from themeroller alone it doesn't have enough css to make the transitions work, and if i download the whole pack there are vast swathes of CSS i'll need to overwrite

[02:53:17] <gnarf> or is it window.parent
[02:53:19] * gnarf shrugs
[02:53:24] <gnarf> assuming same domain
[02:53:48] <gnarf> also - take a look at the ajaxForm plugin, it might handle the same thing and have some code for you
[02:53:50] <gnarf> ?ajaxForm
[02:53:52] <bot-t> ajaxForm plugin - Full AJAX form support, including file upload capabilities. The primary methods for managing your form are ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/form
[02:54:34] <Chetic> actually I'm making my own plugin for some university work
[02:54:57] <Chetic> I'd like it if I didn't have to do anything on the php side
[02:55:02] <gnarf> that doesn't mean you can't look at someone elses code ;)
[02:55:07] <gnarf> check the ajaxForm plugin
[02:55:13] <Chetic> haha right, good point
[02:56:30] <gnarf> fileUploadIframe seems to handle it
[02:56:32] <gnarf> its not easy
[02:56:35] <gnarf> and it does some other stuff
[02:56:41] <gnarf> but you should see how to get at the content window, etc
[02:56:59] <VictorCL> if I have this  $("#id").live("click"....    then  after some action I need to unbind it .. but I need a way to bind it again ..   how can do this ?
[02:57:14] <VictorCL> or diable temporarily the live("click" ..
[02:57:56] <gnarf> VictorCL: have a var that is something like "shouldRunHandler" then if ( !shouldRunHandler) return in the event
[02:58:00] <gnarf> then just toggle shouldRunHandler
[02:58:13] <VictorCL> ok
[03:01:07] <VictorCL> yeah good idea ,, didnt think of that :)
[03:11:13] <talin_> i am trying to make this work, without much luck: http://charlie.griefer.com/blog/2009/09/17/jquery-dynamically-adding-form-elements/
[03:11:19] <talin_> is there something in particular i have to be aware of?
[03:13:16] <talin_> i did put my <script> outside of <head>, is that okay?
[03:13:32] <talin_> my webpage inherits a header that is common, so a lot of files would get this javascript otherwise
[03:15:04] <mazzachre> I have made a new widget (a font selector) (some of you have already heard of my toils with it :D) Now I am down to a few select problems before the first release... I can't seem to make the cursor on my custom select list go into pointer mode, it stays in default... I have tried to apply various jqueryUI classes to the element on hover to make it change, the background changes and works fine, but I can't make the cursor change with it...
[03:15:09] <xec> talin_: you can put <script> tags wherever you like. bottom of the page is often the best place
[03:15:36] <mazzachre> I have prior solved this by adding a custom css, but I would rather like not to
[03:16:07] <talin_> xec: ah, great
[03:17:42] <mazzachre> Can someone help me with getting the cursor to pointer when hovering, without adding custom css file to the system?
[03:18:27] <mindis|wurk> well you could define it inline css too
[03:18:52] <xec> mazzachre: http://jsfiddle.net/LWFTp/
[03:19:35] <xec> like mindis|wurk suggests, this adds inline css via js
[03:20:11] <mazzachre> Ah, simple... :D
[03:20:13] <mazzachre> thx
[03:21:06] <xwurf> how can i ensure that $.fn.yiiGridView.update is called after another jquery-function has finished?
[03:21:51] <mehrdad_> hey guys
[03:22:02] <yan_nick> hey guys, how can i use bind instead of delegate here?
[03:22:03] <yan_nick> $(params.container).delegate(this.canvas.mode == 'svg' ? 'path' : 'shape', 'mouseover mouseout', function(e) {
[03:22:10] <mehrdad_> happy new year from me :)
[03:22:11] <xec> xwurf: what is this other jquery function you speak of?
[03:22:12] <mehrdad_> i have a strange problem with a jquery plugin
[03:22:29] <mehrdad_> when i load it some elements of the page disappear
[03:22:46] <mehrdad_> and when i unload it they return
[03:23:25] <xwurf> @xec: exactly before i call $.fn.yiiGridView.update i set a filter param
[03:23:38] <xec> mehrdad_: maybe some shared css class names? but anything will be wild guesses if you can't show us a live demonstration
[03:23:39] <mehrdad_> the strange part is that the plugin which is a georgian to solar calendar converter, has no css altering
[03:23:48] <mehrdad_> it is purely calculations
[03:23:55] <xwurf> @xex:              $('input[name=\"blabla\"]').val(\"bla\");
[03:24:34] <mehrdad_> xec, the generated css in the firebug are not different!
[03:24:45] <xwurf> @xec: but the problem is that the cgridview-update ignores the new input value
[03:24:50] <mehrdad_> only html tags are added which is obvious
[03:24:59] <xec> ?demo
[03:24:59] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[03:25:07] <xec> ^ goes for both of you ;)
[03:25:09] <mehrdad_> xec, how can it be so, i mean no css difference!
[03:25:21] <yan_nick> xec: can anybode tell me how to use bind instead of delegate here? $(params.container).delegate(this.canvas.mode == 'svg' ? 'path' : 'shape', 'mouseover mouseout', function(e) {
[03:26:07] <xec> yan_nick: why?
[03:26:55] <yan_nick> xec: because i have to fix a plugin for jquery 1.3 oO
[03:27:21] <xec> isn't it easier to update jquery?
[03:27:50] <xec> rather than downgrade a plugin...
[03:28:12] <yan_nick> xec: no, he has lot of modules which are incompatibble.
[03:28:24] <yan_nick> xec: i wanna save time now and fix the one line
[03:28:32] <yan_nick> that would be the only reason to update
[03:29:15] <mehrdad_> pity that i cant show a live demo, it is a local site and i am at work right now
[03:29:25] <mehrdad_> i mean it is in development
[03:31:12] <xec> mehrdad_: maybe you could reproduce the issue at jsfiddle.net ?
[03:31:43] <mehrdad_> the extended calendar plugin has no css stuff of its own and it relies on the jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.min.js library for css stuff
[03:32:18] <mehrdad_> it is a heavy site
[03:32:24] <mehrdad_> it is an erm site
[03:32:35] <mehrdad_> it is difficult to reproducei t :/
[03:32:40] <mehrdad_> it*
[03:33:07] <mehrdad_> oops, confused with ORM , ERP i meant
[03:34:37] <xec> sorry, but without being able to see the issue it is impossible to debug
[03:34:44] <blerghmann> this might not be the right channel, but can anyone give advice on the following situation: I have wave files in a database that I need to play through my MVC project, but I thought I would use javascript to start/stop the sound. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
[03:37:12] <xec> yan_nick: i can't give you a quick fix, maybe read the documentation, and maybe this helps: http://www.alfajango.com/blog/the-difference-between-jquerys-bind-live-and-delegate/ (havent read it myself, just looks promising)
[03:38:01] <mehrdad_> xec, , maybe u could look into the two jquery files and see if u can notice something? :) the problematic file is small
[03:38:27] <mehrdad_> but u r right
[03:38:39] <mehrdad_> maybe something else is messing it up
[03:41:12] <mehrdad_> but the thing is the mentioned jquery file doesn't seem to add or change any css stuff
[03:41:36] <mehrdad_> but since i have petty familiarity with jquery, i ask u to check it out plz
[03:41:51] <mehrdad_> and see if it has any css changes in it
[03:42:15] <mehrdad_> it is small file as i said, so it wouldn't take more than 3 mins of ur time
[03:42:26] <xec> mehrdad_: i cannot possibly know what an unknown file does to an unknown page. see http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/
[03:43:39] <mehrdad_> xec, i see it is difficult to diagnose it this way, i understand it
[03:44:16] <xec> i don't mean to be offensive, but what you are saying does not make any sense - if the script didnt have any effect on elements, then elements would not be effected
[03:45:32] <mehrdad_> the css in firebug shows no difference as far as i can see
[03:45:48] <xec> mehrdad_: feel free to post a url to the script in question though, if anyone has the time to look into it, maybe they will. personally i have better things to do ;)
[03:45:57] <mehrdad_> let me play with it and see what i can do
[03:46:23] <opalepatrick> Anyone have any pointers to tutorials re draggable & droppable for image to basket (not getting the one in the docs, yet)
[03:54:28] <mazzachre> http://randstoft.dk/fontselector/ What else to do about it?
[03:55:11] <mazzachre> I have a thought about widgetizing the selector implementation, that seems like a general purpose thing that could be done fairly easily.
[03:58:49] <eugenmayer> iam writing a plugin, were iam instatiating other objects and want to pass myself as reference, so they call methods of the plugin. Somehow, the "this" context seems not to have the methods available. I define them using this.methodname = function() â€¦ eventhough the defined properties are there. Any ideas?
[03:59:21] <talin_> i want a button that i can click multiple times, and each time, it will display a DIV that was formerly hidden
[03:59:25] <talin_> is that possible with jquery?
[03:59:45] <eugenmayer> oh holy..its the order of declaration..
[04:00:11] <yan_nick> xec: can i do this? http://pastebin.com/RvRfTNTH
[04:00:42] <muay-guy> how can I load jquerymobile with jquery depending on device width?
[04:02:06] <xec> ?tias @ yan_nick
[04:02:07] <bot-t> yan_nick, Try It And See
[04:02:48] <yan_nick> xec: my map is working now because the error message gone away but i think sth is not working now
[04:02:51] <xec> yan_nick: i don't know why you are wrapping type in $() though
[04:03:06] <yan_nick> xec: because it's the selector
[04:03:11] <xec> and?
[04:03:13] <yan_nick> ;(
[04:03:30] <yan_nick> xec: i tried it without $() ...
[04:03:48] <yan_nick> .find(type) should be enough
[04:07:54] <xwurf> hi, is there a way to encode special signs like %, [ etc... via jquery val() which returns the input of an input field?
[04:10:26] <rzec> can anyone tell me why qUnit would tell me a test failed but only give me the excepted and not the results or any explanation on what failed (generally I get a diff of the difference when comparing JSON object which is what I am doing here)?
[04:11:56] <mazzachre> muay-guy: If you don't want double loading, you have to have a device database and select it server side... I think the double load method is better though, make as much of the page generic as possible and fetch the scripts needed via jsonp
[04:15:56] <talin_> i am trying to display a hidden div, but with little success: http://jsfiddle.net/xbLqu/
[04:18:34] <udp> talin_: that div isn't hidden
[04:18:58] <udp> talin_: and the button doesn't exist
[04:20:42] <udp> talin_: http://jsfiddle.net/xbLqu/1/
[04:24:03] <talin_> udp: thank you. now the button is there, but it doesn't do anything
[04:24:14] <talin_> udp: maybe slidedown only works with <p> and not <div>?
[04:24:28] <udp> talin_: it works fine here (well, only the first time obviously)
[04:24:31] <udp> which browser are you using?
[04:24:35] <talin_> udp: chrome
[04:25:37] <udp> it slides down perfectly for me
[04:25:45] <udp> chrome and FF
[04:26:06] <udp> http://jsfiddle.net/xbLqu/1/ right?
[04:26:33] <xwurf> hi, https://gist.github.com/1554737
[04:26:41] <xwurf> no, the problem is if "varfromjavascript" containts a forbidden url-sign like "%", i get "malformed url".
[04:26:51] <xwurf> any chance to handle it globally so that the url is escaped before send to the server?
[04:27:00] <xwurf> no=now
[04:27:11] <talin_> udp: you added <button> and that the div is display: none; only right?
[04:27:24] <udp> well, I also selected jquery instead of mootools
[04:28:04] <talin_> udp: what?
[04:28:14] <udp> in jsfiddle, you had mootools selected
[04:28:41] <talin_> udp: ah. weird that it doesn't work in my bwoser then
[04:28:57] <udp> oh also
[04:29:01] <udp> remove the <script></script> tags
[04:29:54] <talin_> udp: without those, the code appears as text
[04:31:11] <udp> you don't need the <script></script> in jsfiddle
[04:32:01] <udp> you do in your own page obviously (but then in your own page you should also have this executing when the DOM is ready, not right away)
[04:32:18] <muay-guy> mmm and how can I detect the browser width the same way i do in css with media queries? is there a way to do this so for example, if I load the page on an iphone it doesn't load the pictures?
[04:32:54] <talin_> udp: hmm, ok
[04:34:50] <udp> talin_: http://paste.pocoo.org/raw/529288/
[04:52:31] <talin_> udp: hmm, it doesn't work here
[04:52:56] <donCams> i'm using $.ajax, how do i handle if it returns an error like 302error?
[04:52:59] <talin_> not with IE and not with chrome
[04:54:18] <aro> thats a redirect
[04:54:38] <ravenzz> donCams within the error callback
[04:54:38] <aro> @doncams
[04:54:43] <ravenzz> ^
[04:55:20] <ravenzz> it shouldn't be an error anyway
[04:55:20] <talin_> udp: i have my code inside a <td>, is that ok?
[04:55:30] <Vainoharhainen> What function sould i use to cancel a form submit? event.preventDefault(); is not working on IE.
[04:56:24] <fotoflo> hi all. I'm looking at http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/milk/
[04:56:33] <ravenzz> Vainoharhainen $('#thefoorm').submit(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); });
[04:56:40] <mazzachre> Vainoharhainen: Make the submit into a javascript function that returns false
[04:56:41] <donCams> hmmm, ravenzz, reference please
[04:56:42] <fotoflo> and i've got a quick question: why is the first line var validator = $("#signupform").validate({
[04:57:02] <fotoflo> why are they putting that in a var? i don't see a return
[04:57:05] <ravenzz> donCams http://stackoverflow.com/questions/199099/how-to-manage-a-redirect-request-after-a-jquery-ajax-call#answer-1534662
[04:57:07] <donCams> aro, how do i follow the redirect?
[04:57:15] <AdvoWork> if ive got this very simple set of code for an auto complete, http://jsfiddle.net/McLNW/ how would I add a success function in there, or so I can somehow check the data returned, so if data returned == "test" for example?
[04:58:25] <donCams> thanks
[05:00:52] <xwurf> hi, has anyone experience with the $.fn.yiiGridView.update method in jquery.yiigridview.js ?
[05:03:52] <is_null> hi all, what does jqueryui sortable() do exactly ? i'm doing it on a fieldset, and when i do it clicking on an input doesn't set the focus on it anymore - only clicking on the label sets the focus on the inputs ... i'm trying to reproduce the problem on a simple page but i seem to fail so any wild guess is appreciated
[05:04:19] <udp> talin_: show me the page if you want
[05:06:53] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Is there some reliable way of creating a unique value? I see that jQuery creates objects like jQuery23409852171 ... how does it do that?
[05:06:55] <mazzachre> Can I listen to an event when the value of an input field changes? I have tried to bind 'change' but the event is never called
[05:07:13] <airdem> hello guys. i need a web app for managing a restaurants menu. (adding/editing/removing items with 1-3 properties, groups, sortable, ...) is there already any jquery plugin for this kind of function?
[05:08:41] <airdem> i found some grid plugins but i was wondering if there are any better plugins suiting my needs. or maybe you could tell me some keywords to search for
[05:08:59] <talin_> udp: i am trying to do it with normal javascript now
[05:09:10] <fotoflo> anyone have experience with http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation#?
[05:09:13] <fotoflo>  ?
[05:09:17] <xwurf> @rawtaz: i think i got this globally to work (in javascript-file itself) whenever its the case i manually set the "url:" param: if (options.url!==undefined) { options.url = encodeURI(options.url); }
[05:09:23] <udp> talin_: you'll save yourself a lot of trouble to use jquery
[05:09:24] <Zauberfisch> airdem maybe http://datatables.net/
[05:09:46] <talin_> udp: well, i tried all day with jquery
[05:10:01] <udp> talin_: I just showed you exactly how to do it with jquery
[05:10:27] <talin_> udp: i don't think jquery works when you ude it isnide  a <td></td>
[05:10:49] <udp> why are you doing that?
[05:11:27] <talin_> udp: because i have a form that has <td>s
[05:11:33] * sadmicrowave awake
[05:11:56] <udp> the script should be wrapped in <script> tags in your <head>
[05:12:16] <talin_> udp: must it be in <head>? all my pages share the same head
[05:12:57] <udp> no, it doesn't have to be
[05:14:06] <sadmicrowave> hey, real quick, is there an irc command to display the last message with my nick in it?
[05:14:06] <bot-t> (116 hours ago) <kborchers> tell sadmicrowave hey got your message from a couple days ago. let me know if you needed anything or just saying hi
[05:14:12] <sadmicrowave> nevermind
[05:14:13] <sadmicrowave> lol
[05:14:36] <sadmicrowave> bot-t, tell kborchers nope I was just saying hey
[05:14:37] <bot-t> sadmicrowave, Okay.
[05:19:07] <XB23> hey guys
[05:19:12] <XB23> having an issue, trying to use closest
[05:19:32] <XB23>          $('.select_car').closest('.selected_text').html('');
[05:19:44] <XB23> trying to use that to clear a div with class selected_text
[05:20:31] <t1m_> hey guys
[05:20:54] <t1m_> i have got a problem. This line does not work and i dont know why: onClick='$("#messageShow").html("Zylus just finished your dungeon Starting Dungeon and took your Running Shoes-Orb. It might be a good idea to improve it!");'
[05:20:56] <rzec> how to I test equality of a json object?  when I created 2 different json objects exactly the same way with the same data and do equal() on them, it says the test failed and I assume that it because they are 2 different instances of an object with the same external data but some internal data is different.
[05:21:08] <rzec> this is with qunit
[05:21:54] <talin_> udp: now i am trying your solution again. maybe i should paste the code for you
[05:22:15] <udp> talin_: last time you did that, it worked in jsfiddle but not on your page
[05:23:12] <udp> t1m_: are you really setting onClick to a string?
[05:23:12] <talin_> udp: http://codepad.org/30Ql2c5D
[05:24:21] <t1m_> upd: seems so? what did i do wrong :)?
[05:24:42] <talin_> udp: shouldn't button have some id or something?
[05:24:51] <udp> talin_: yes it should, but it should still work
[05:25:00] <t1m_> udp: seems so? what did i do wrong :)?
[05:25:21] <udp> talin_: what's this templating system you're using?  is it generating HTML in the frontend or the backend?
[05:25:33] <talin_> udp: it's django's mako system
[05:26:22] <sadmicrowave> XB23, where is .select_car in relation to .selected_text?
[05:26:35] <udp> backend then (I was going to say - if you generated the button on the fly, it might be generated after the function would have been bound)
[05:26:44] <talin_> udp: even if i put alert() in my javascript stuff nothing happens
[05:26:57] <udp> talin_: can I see it in action somewhere?
[05:27:14] <talin_> udp: it's not on the internet :(
[05:27:55] <udp> oh wait a second
[05:28:01] <udp> you're using div.extra_products
[05:28:03] <udp> . selects a class
[05:28:04] <sadmicrowave> t1m_, are you getting an error or warning on click?
[05:28:06] <udp> whereas the div has an id
[05:28:21] <talin_> udp: i can do div class= then
[05:28:33] <talin_> udp: still nothing
[05:28:46] <t1m_> sadmicrowave: no, when i replace the command with an alert()-command it works finde
[05:29:28] <AdvoWork> if ive got this very simple set of code for an auto complete, http://jsfiddle.net/McLNW/ how would I add a success function in there, or so I can somehow check the data returned, so if data returned == "test" for example?
[05:29:48] <sadmicrowave> t1m_, have you included your jquery core ref link in your html head?
[05:29:56] <udp> talin_: well, I can't see anything wrong with the code if you've done that, so unless I can see it live ...
[05:30:25] <t1m_> sadmicrowave: i included jquery.js and jquery-ui.js
[05:31:18] <talin_> udp: hmm, now alert() inside the javascript shows up actually
[05:31:29] <sadmicrowave> t1m_, perhaps then #messageShow is not what you think it is
[05:31:31] <talin_> udp: so maybe it's the line: $("div.extra_products:hidden").slideDown ("slow") that is wrong
[05:31:56] <udp> talin_: if you have a div with the class extra_products and it's hidden, that'll select it
[05:32:05] <sadmicrowave> talin_, you have a space after .slideDown?
[05:32:08] <udp> note *class*, not id
[05:32:11] <t1m_> sadmicrowave: when i assign that command to a link, it works... just does not with the <tr> tag
[05:32:14] <udp> sadmicrowave: what's wrong with that?
[05:32:57] <sadmicrowave> nothing it just looks funny
[05:32:59] <talin_> udp: yes, i made <div class="extra_products"> now
[05:33:12] <talin_> sadmicrowave: yes, there is a space there. is that mandatory?
[05:33:19] <sadmicrowave> no
[05:33:46] <talin_> udp: are you sure it should say :hidden?
[05:34:21] <Dunstkreis> Hi Folks, 3 days ago BinaryKitten helped me realising that a ".class" selector is much faster than a "tag.class". Now i am wondering if someone knows about the speed of XPath selectors...
[05:34:24] <udp> talin_: doesn't matter
[05:35:01] <is_null> hi all, anybody wants to debug a hard bug in jquery-ui sortable which i cannot reproduce in a simple script ? i doubt so but i'm asking just in case :D
[05:35:06] <sadmicrowave> t1m_, so #messageShow is a <tr> or your click $(this) is a <tr>
[05:35:10] <sadmicrowave> ?
[05:35:42] <t1m_> sadmicrowave: #messageShow is a div, click $(this) is a tr
[05:35:53] <talin_> udp: i can see that the div isn't hidden when the page loads. style="display: none;" should hide it, no?
[05:36:01] <udp> talin_: yes, that should hide it
[05:36:05] <is_null> when i call $('fieldset').sortable(): it's not possible to focus on any input anymore :(
[05:36:29] <is_null> even after calling $('fieldset').sortable('destroy') which makes me tend to think that there is a bug in jqueryui
[05:36:42] <is_null> that it doesn't clean its handlers very well in destroy
[05:37:18] <Zogot> Anyone come across issues with Twitter bootstrap and Google Maps before?  I'm not getting all the google map view to load correctly.
[05:38:21] <mazzachre> is_null: 'destroy' does not always work... There are multiple examples where widgets do not clean up after themselves...
[05:38:46] <sadmicrowave> t1m_, perhaps your problem is somewhere else: http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/HuPHR/
[05:39:19] * fotoflo is getting fed up with jQuery Validate.  5 minutes from writing my own regular expressions 
[05:39:54] <t1m_> sadmicrowave: ill try it that way
[05:40:17] <fotoflo> should i be putting my rules in the class? or in the <input> tag itself? or passed as an object to .validate()?
[05:40:35] <fotoflo> it seems really inconsistant
[05:41:51] <fotoflo> when passing the rules as a variable to .validate() should i be passing the input name or the id?
[05:42:17] <is_null> mazzachre: really ? where can i learn more about that ?
[05:42:36] <is_null> 'destroy' does disable the draggable behaviour thought
[05:42:52] <sadmicrowave> t1m_, I also did it this way and it worked: http://jsfiddle.net/sadmicrowave/HuPHR/1/
[05:43:15] <sadmicrowave> t1m_, which again, leads me to believe there is something wrong elsewhere
[05:43:53] <t1m_> sadmicrowave: i got a few problems with using " and ' in my strings, because i echo it with php. it should work, but i am not quite sure, so i will do it again the other way and look if it works
[05:44:13] <mazzachre> is_null: Well, besides experimenting, read up on the dev board, there are some posts about it.
[05:44:24] <sadmicrowave> t1m_, post your actual code somewhere i.e. pastebin or something for me to look at
[05:44:47] <t1m_> sadmicrowave: already edited... will do, when i am finished, give me 10min :)
[05:44:52] <sadmicrowave> k
[05:45:25] <sadmicrowave> t1m_, sounds like you have not properly escaped your strings in php and that is causing the problem.
[05:45:33] <is_null> mazzachre: this issue affects firefox, but not chromium
[05:46:00] <t1m_> sadmicrowave: what i showed you was the generated html, but i also think, that could be the problem
[05:47:07] <sadmicrowave> t1m_, I think you are right
[05:47:29] <sadmicrowave> t1m_, like I said, show me your code when you are ready
[05:50:35] <talin_> udp: i am doing the same, but to the TRs instead of the DIV. now it actually blinks, like the DIVs are display for half a second before ti disappears
[05:54:58] <talin_> when i run this short and simple example, the TR is displayed for half a second every time i click my button. why doesn't it stay put? http://codepad.org/TDWHqIzd
[05:55:16] <talin_> i want to click and then display the TR
[05:56:24] * sadmicrowave is going to a meeting
[05:56:36] <talin_> sadmicrowave: good luck!
[05:57:46] <nFFF> talin_, why you not using shwo?
[05:57:52] <nFFF> show()
[05:58:34] <hubbl3> talin_: try using slideUp('slow') or slideToggle('slow')
[05:59:04] <Zogot> Slides and animations dont work correctly
[05:59:05] <Zogot> on tables
[05:59:56] <talin_> hubbl3: same result
[06:00:06] <talin_> nFFF: well, slide is cooler, but neither of the mwork
[06:00:14] <talin_> it just displays the TRs for like half a second
[06:00:35] <nFFF> tali, can you put it on jsfiddle?
[06:00:41] <talin_> nFFF: yep
[06:01:15] <Zogot> slides and animations dont work on tables correctly
[06:01:50] <talin_> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/CnQ6w/
[06:01:56] <Zogot> Table rows present particular obstacles to animation, since browsers use different values (table-row and block) for their visible display property. The .hide() and .show() methods, without animation, are always safe to use with table rows. As of jQuery version 1.1.3, .fadeIn() and .fadeOut() can be used as well.
[06:03:20] <talin_> show is the same. pops up for a second
[06:03:31] * talin_ bangs his head against the wall
[06:03:54] <hubbl3> talin_: I tried it in jsfiddle, Zogot is right. Table sucks at animation. I feel sorry for your head mann.
[06:04:17] <talin_> hubbl3: thank you. but show() shouldn't be animation?
[06:06:20] <molby> 1
[06:07:01] <udp> talin_: back
[06:07:07] <hubbl3> talin_: It isn't.
[06:07:35] <talin_> udp: hello sir. i manage to make the button display the TR for half a second now
[06:08:32] <udp> hmm this is odd
[06:09:21] <molby> what's odd?
[06:10:41] <udp> in jsfiddle, the table seems to disintegrate
[06:11:12] <udp> oh it's not in a <table> at all
[06:12:10] <udp> talin_: http://jsfiddle.net/CnQ6w/5/
[06:12:13] <talin_> udp: when i put the table tags in jsfiddle, it works. not in my browser though
[06:15:26] <udp> talin_: all you can do is try to show us the page (a version with the problem isolated would do)
[06:15:46] <udp> talin_: if it works in jsfiddle but not in your page, something else must be going wrong
[06:21:35] <Dunstkreis> Hi Folks, 3 days ago BinaryKitten / Kit-10 helped me realising that a ".class" selector is much faster than a "tag.class". Now i am wondering if someone knows about the speed of XPath selectors...
[06:21:59] <udp> probably also slower on browsers without getElementsByTagName
[06:22:08] <udp> *ByClassName
[06:22:25] <erichynds> jquery doesn't support xpath selectors
[06:22:34] <erichynds> (anymore)
[06:22:38] <Michael> good
[06:22:51] <Michael> xpath is slowww!
[06:26:09] <t1m_> did i do anything wrong with this JS code? http://pastebin.com/Weq8BL4F
[06:26:25] <JAAulde> Have any of you ever seen delegated events seemingly become undelegeated? It seems that after a certain UI of mine has been loaded in the browser for a long period of tim, the events which were delegated no longer get handled.
[06:26:36] <t1m_> (apart from that ' fail)
[06:26:37] <udp> t1m_: yes, you missed a ' at the end of the selector
[06:26:43] <udp> ha
[06:27:01] <udp> then no, you didn't
[06:27:45] <t1m_> udp: any idea why that method is not invoked when i click on a <tr> tag with class="clickable" ?
[06:27:49] <erichynds> JAAulde: are you removing the element that the events are delegated to?
[06:28:00] <fotoflo> i am STUCK on jquery validate() â€¦  http://jsfiddle.net/ayMvb/
[06:28:03] <JAAulde> erichynds: no, unfortunately
[06:28:20] <fotoflo> password and repeat password are not being validated
[06:28:44] <JAAulde> erichynds: in some of the interaction the widget element (parent to which things are delegated) does get detached and then re-appended
[06:28:50] <udp> t1m_: did the tr exist when the page loaded?
[06:28:54] <udp> or was it generated
[06:29:08] <fotoflo> if you enter 5 chars on password and 8 chars on repeat password, and nothing else you can submit the form
[06:29:10] <xec> t1m_: seems to work: http://jsfiddle.net/c9ehx/
[06:29:11] <erichynds> JAAulde: hmm.. that shouldn't blow away your events though
[06:29:13] <xrated> fotoflo, you seem to have the wrong ID specified
[06:29:32] <JAAulde> erichynds: agreed, and in general it doesn't.  it seems to be related to sitting for a long period of time without refresh
[06:29:43] <xrated> The ID you are feeding the validate method is inputPassword, the form's ID for the password confirm is inputPasswordConfirm
[06:29:50] <t1m_> udp: i am using the yii framework and the tr is generated in one of the template files... i will check on that
[06:29:59] <xrated> oh wait
[06:30:01] <xrated> I'm a dumbass
[06:30:02] <JAAulde> erichynds: which would point to a possible performance issue--and I def have some performance issues in this widget.  it's intense
[06:30:10] <udp> t1m_: if it's generated in the backend, it's fine
[06:30:26] <erichynds> JAAulde: bizarre. you could always bind() to the document and implement delegation yourself, which would at least allow you to see if your selectors are still being matched or not
[06:30:33] <t1m_> udp: should be, yeah
[06:31:32] <fotoflo> xrated: err. i think i am telling it that the item named passwordConfirm must match the time with ID inputPassword
[06:31:34] <JAAulde> erichynds: yeah, I'll have to give that a try. i am trying to get permission to have a temporary VPN cert issued for me to give to people in here to use in connecting to this system to help me trouble shoot some of it.
[06:31:41] <JAAulde> these performance issues I am facing in IE are KILLER
[06:31:43] <xrated> fotoflo, yeah, my mistake. Sorry.
[06:31:48] <Snooops> How was the nopaste url?
[06:32:01] <Snooops> ah got it
[06:32:19] <t1m_> udp: this is the corresponding php code: http://pastebin.com/evw6ZKGC
[06:32:53] <udp> any JS errors?  which jquery version?
[06:33:05] <fotoflo> xrated: my first question (this isn't clear anywhere in the documentation) is that my rules should be pointing to a NAME and equal to should be pointing to an ID? or both point to ID?
[06:33:59] <udp> t1m_: as a side note, you should really use CSS for hovers
[06:34:05] <t1m_> udp: jquery 1.6.2, no errors that i can see
[06:34:06] <xec> t1m_: this snippet has javascript code embedded in html which is a php string embedded in html
[06:34:33] <udp> t1m_: and separate your JS from the HTML, yes
[06:34:46] <xec> i'm dizzy :)
[06:35:04] <t1m_> udp: u removed the JS within the tags :)
[06:35:10] <t1m_> u = i^^
[06:35:14] <Snooops> hello, this: $("#hiddenIframe").contents().find("#iframeForm").submit(); isnt working for me. any workaround?
[06:35:44] <t1m_> still not working :(
[06:35:51] <udp> is the page online?
[06:36:11] <t1m_> yeah, wait a moment
[06:36:39] <Jonno_FTW> how can I get all the form name:value mappings out of a form?
[06:37:21] <Jonno_FTW> for use in $.ajax){data ?
[06:37:29] <t1m_> udp: i will send the needed user data via pm-query
[06:37:47] <xec> Jonno_FTW: maybe see ?serialize
[06:37:47] <bot-t> Jonno_FTW, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[06:38:14] <Jonno_FTW> ok,
[06:38:19] <fotoflo> is anyone here firmiliar with jquery validate? or do you guys all just write your own validation'?
[06:39:06] <Jonno_FTW> data: { $(this).serialize() }, ?
[06:39:35] <Snooops> how can i submit a form inside an iframe?
[06:39:49] <xec> oh sorry. no, not useful for ajax i suppose
[06:39:59] <Pilate> call the submit function on the form, if its on the same domain
[06:40:13] <xec> unless you make it part of the url perhaps
[06:42:24] <xec> Jonno_FTW: actually, i found this snippet in the docs; $.post("test.php", $("#testform").serialize());
[06:42:35] <Sonderblade> how can you count the number of checkboxes in a <table>, excluding those in the <tr> with class = "hdr"?
[06:44:18] <Jonno_FTW> xec: thanks
[06:44:53] <Jonno_FTW> xec: the .ajax docs has data: "name=John&location=Boston"
[06:44:56] <udp> Sonderblade: $('#mytable').find('tr:not(.hdr) input[type=checkbox]').length
[06:44:59] <Jonno_FTW> I just need my string like that
[06:45:08] <Jonno_FTW> from the form data
[06:45:19] <xec> yeah, serialize does that
[06:45:28] <Jonno_FTW> righ then
[06:46:01] <xec> just omit the { } you had in your example
[06:46:17] <Sonderblade> udp: perfect, thanks
[07:01:16] <Salah> Is there any ways to get URL parameters with jquery?
[07:03:00] <khmer_> Salah: no, but there are plenty of plugins
[07:03:02] <Kingsy> anyone know of a nice image slider that works in ie6? I am using nivo slider at the moment but that gives me errors in ie6
[07:03:11] <khmer_> Salah: in general, a function to take apart the query string should be easy to write
[07:07:12] <Kingsy> actually it doesnt work in ie7 either..
[07:10:31] <Kingsy> if someone could maybe take a look and help me trace the error? --> www.kingsy.co.uk/cooking4life <-- works in FF not in ie7
[07:11:25] <mathi> hi
[07:11:37] <mathi> how can I hide/show pieces of code like this: </tbody></table><table><tbody>
[07:11:39] <xec> my new year's resolution is to ignore anything IE related ;)
[07:12:04] <Michael> IE9 is a great step ahead. I just wish it supported more CSS3
[07:13:14] <dr0id> my new year's resolution is to somehow get Windows and IE9 installed someday.
[07:13:27] <xec> Michael: i remember when everyone was complaining how IE5.5 didnt support the current standards. MS promised to fix everything in IE6
[07:13:32] <mathi> anyone?
[07:13:43] <xec> mathi: i'm not sure what you mean
[07:13:59] <Kingsy> xec: haha nice!
[07:13:59] <xec> mathi: you want to toggle the display of a table?
[07:14:25] <mathi> xec, I need to be able to split a table in two and things like that
[07:15:03] <xec> mathi: hm, what have you got so far?
[07:15:21] <Nomikos> I think you'll need to create a second empty table and move rows/tbody elements as needed
[07:16:36] <xec> mathi: also, define "things like that" :)
[07:16:56] <Kingsy> anyone else fancy taking a look?
[07:17:34] <Kingsy> ohh  nm
[07:17:36] <Kingsy> forget that
[07:17:42] <Kingsy> i hope.. hehe
[07:17:51] <xec> fingers crossed :)
[07:18:36] <mathi> well, it's complicated to explain the details. PHP is generating structured data, there are two possible views. one table or two tables in two columns
[07:19:15] <mathi> and I want the user to be able to switch the view, without sending a request to the server to generate the table again
[07:20:02] <Kingsy> well I fixed the error but the slider still doesnt work in ie6
[07:20:05] <Kingsy> suprise supriose
[07:20:17] <Kingsy> so is anyone aware of a nice slider for ie6?
[07:20:44] <Michael> Just curious why you are supporting Ie6
[07:20:55] <anli_> How do I get rid of highlighted checkboxes?
[07:21:16] <Michael> We completely dropped IE6 support because it's too small of a fraction of visitors
[07:21:57] <Nomikos> Microsoft is actively discouraging its use. I'd charge the customer extra and have someone else do it.
[07:22:18] <Kingsy> yep its a pain..
[07:22:28] <khmer_> the only excuse is a corporate intranet
[07:22:50] <Michael> http://www.ie6countdown.com/
[07:23:05] <Kingsy> well its a website for schools.. they still use it..
[07:23:07] <Michael> khmer_: I'd drop the client :) So I wouldn't be much help to you
[07:23:07] <Kingsy> idiots
[07:23:21] <khmer_> schools i respect
[07:23:29] <khmer_> limited funds, supporting IE6 makes sense there
[07:23:57] <khmer_> i was only gonna be a hardliner if it was a client building a site for the general internet and demanding ie6 support to make them feel good and egalitarian
[07:24:02] <Pilate> how does that logic work khmer_?
[07:24:03] <Michael> How? IE7 is free
[07:24:03] <Nomikos> ehrm... the longer they wait to upgrade, the more it'll cost them
[07:24:07] <khmer_> but for a special purpose, IE6 support can just be necessary
[07:24:29] <khmer_> you guys have never worked with public school systems
[07:24:32] <Michael> khmer_: I would have it function in IE6 but not have to look pretty
[07:24:36] <Nomikos> Besides, they could just install a recent Firefox as an alternative browser
[07:24:38] <khmer_> yeah agreed
[07:24:39] <Michael> progressive enhancement++
[07:24:58] <Zauberfisch> khmer_ its not like FF or chrome would be that expensive :P
[07:25:17] <khmer_> wow, you guys have really never worked with public school systems
[07:25:23] <Oldskool> luckily not
[07:25:42] <Sonderblade> Michael: gratis, for no cost or available for free. Free it aint though
[07:25:44] <Pilate> anecdotally ive also never seen a public school still using ie6
[07:25:45] <Zauberfisch> luckily not (:
[07:25:58] <khmer_> Pilate: likewise, but i've seen some crazy shit
[07:26:03] <khmer_> Pilate: and some nonprofits still using IE6
[07:26:07] <khmer_> it's entirely plausible
[07:26:16] <Pilate> ... so how does it make sense to support ie6 in public schools if youve never seen ie6 in a public school?
[07:26:25] <Nomikos> yes, it's also stupid, IMO.
[07:26:40] <khmer_> yes, and traffic patterns are stupid IMO but i obey them
[07:26:42] <anli_> hehe
[07:26:43] <Nomikos> The fact that it happens doesn't make it good.
[07:26:45] <khmer_> because other people sometimes have needs i don't like
[07:26:46] <Michael> khmer_: Save yourself the headache and skip animations for IE6
[07:26:53] <khmer_> i'm not the one!
[07:26:56] <khmer_> it's this Kingsy guy
[07:27:01] <anli_> And stop using the <noframe>:s tag
[07:27:03] <khmer_> i haven't had to support IE6 in years
[07:27:11] <Michael> Kingsy: Save yourself the headache and skip animations in IE6
[07:27:12] <anli_> oh, its <noframes>
[07:27:13] <NoiseEee> i'm supporting ie6, wish i didnt have to
[07:27:14] <khmer_> i'm trying to express compassion and understanding
[07:27:23] <Michael> khmer_: You both start with 'k' :P
[07:27:23] <khmer_> i think i may have picked the wrong venue
[07:27:25] <NoiseEee> ontario government = ie6 until 2013
[07:27:29] <Michael> And I'm just getting back from vacay
[07:27:34] <Michael> sorry
[07:27:35] <khmer_> :)
[07:27:54] <anli_> And you dont have to think about web safe colors any longer :)
[07:28:19] <Nomikos> or 640 x 480
[07:28:21] <anli_> haha
[07:28:32] <anli_> I think there are a lot of 640x480 users actually
[07:28:35] <xec> not entirely true
[07:28:43] <anli_> Everyone with a bad seeing
[07:28:43] * Nomikos cringes and hides
[07:28:44] <xec> right, smaller mobile phones
[07:28:51] <anli_> true
[07:28:56] <anli_> Even if thats more like 480x640
[07:29:41] <Nomikos> I only develop for 36" screens on quad-core/8GB systems with Firefox 12
[07:29:46] <xec> :D
[07:29:47] <anli_> Actually, screen size is a big problem, especially when creating mobile apps
[07:30:08] <anli_> Haha
[07:30:22] <anli_> I only develop for right handed users with 36" screens on a friday
[07:30:36] <Nomikos> (and in 10 years, my remark will be funny for other reasons..)
[07:30:42] <anli_> :)
[07:31:01] <anli_> I think screens will be sizeless in the future
[07:31:06] <xec> "daddy, how did you survive with only four cores??"
[07:31:08] <anli_> Why not use walls
[07:31:22] <NoiseEee> you'll be designing for eye colour
[07:31:24] <Nomikos> implanted HUD, all the way
[07:31:25] <NoiseEee> in-eye screens
[07:31:26] <anli_> haha
[07:31:31] <anli_> yeah
[07:31:46] <anli_> And people will be able to read each others minds
[07:31:55] <xec> imagine when it crashes
[07:31:58] <xec> you go blind :P
[07:32:02] <anli_> Ah, wait, thats now, judging from early sci-fi movies
[07:32:07] <anli_> Haha
[07:32:09] <Nomikos> Oh, the possibilities for viri..
[07:32:17] <anli_> I see blue now, I use windows for eyes
[07:32:22] <xec> :D
[07:32:47] <Zauberfisch> there actually is already a prototype thing that is close to an in eye screen
[07:32:47] <anli_> linux users will be able to see if they configure it up first
[07:33:00] <_ikke_> I have $('input').live('keyup', function(e){console.log('foo'}), but the event never seems to be executed.
[07:33:12] <_ikke_> anyone a clue what can go wrong?
[07:33:27] <_ikke_> note that the input I test it on is dynamically generated.
[07:33:36] <Zauberfisch> like glasses, displaying the image right onto your eye with light
[07:33:40] <Nomikos> _ikke_: what version of jQuery? more recent ones they changed it I think
[07:33:46] <_ikke_> 1.6.4
[07:34:02] <anli_> Did you try to use just $('input).keyup(function(e.... etc
[07:34:09] <_ikke_> anli_: Yes
[07:34:23] <_ikke_> anli_: But at that time the input does not exist yet
[07:34:24] <Nomikos>  executed.
[07:34:35] <Nomikos> ehr, ignore that.
[07:34:40] <Nomikos> _ikke_: this looks off: {console.log('foo'})
[07:34:43] <anli_> I think you cannot use live on non-existing elements, wonder then if you use it on the document itself, dunno
[07:35:10] <_ikke_> Nomikos: Typo on writing the question
[07:35:12] <udp> anli_: of course you can use live on non-existing elements, that's the whole point
[07:35:13] <xec> _ikke_: works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/LcxRA/
[07:35:29] <anli_> udp: so it is not on their parent I use live?
[07:35:38] <anli_> Have not used it
[07:35:59] <udp> live just reads the selector used in the set
[07:36:11] * Nomikos suddenly realizes a bunch of sites where he included 'jquery 1' may have issues now
[07:36:12] <udp> it doesn't actually look at what's been selected
[07:36:13] <xec> live attaches to document root
[07:36:30] <anli_> So $('input) is actually evaluating not only to an array with inputs, but it also keeps the string 'input' so calls to .live can work?
[07:36:44] <anli_> oops, got one ' to few there
[07:36:46] <anli_> too
[07:37:03] <udp> anli_: yeah, and the selection is wasted (one of the reasons .live is deprecated)
[07:37:12] <xec> every time a keyup is fired, the live checks if the selector matches
[07:37:20] <_ikke_> hmm
[07:37:25] <anli_> I have never felt the urge to use .live, can that mean its meaningless?
[07:37:28] <_ikke_> well, is there a better solution for 1.6.4?
[07:37:33] <Nomikos> anli_: no :-p
[07:37:37] <anli_> :)
[07:37:42] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate
[07:37:46] <_ikke_> Ok
[07:37:49] <xec> anli_: not entirely, but delegates, and the more recent .on() are better
[07:37:50] <Eviltwin> Or .on if you're in 1.7+
[07:37:53] <anli_> ok
[07:38:06] <udp> or bind stuff after generating the elements if you can
[07:38:13] <xec> that works too
[07:38:21] <Nomikos> anli_: you don't work a lot with dynamic html?
[07:38:25] <xec> but the less bindings the better
[07:38:27] <anli_> Why would I want to create an event handler for elements I create in the future? Why not set event handlers on element creation?
[07:38:30] <Eviltwin> It works but it's actually slower than delegate for more than 3 elements
[07:38:38] <anli_> Nomikos: exclusively
[07:38:52] <xec> what Eviltwin said
[07:39:17] <Nomikos> anli_: creating an event handler once is easier than on creation everytime?
[07:39:39] <anli_> I dont see how thats easier, it makes a wood of event handlers you have to keep track on
[07:39:48] <_ikke_> anli_: Something about DRY?
[07:40:16] <anli_> I disagree, you dont have to repeat yourself to create elements and their event handlers at the same time
[07:40:19] <Eviltwin> Or take a look at this example: http://jsfiddle.net/8Vp8X/
[07:40:32] <_ikke_> anli_: Well, if all those event handlers basically do the same?
[07:40:49] <anli_> They are still the same function
[07:41:05] <anli_> The code will not be repeated
[07:41:06] <_ikke_> anli_: You are repeating the attachment of the event handler
[07:41:24] <anli_> No, its done in one place of the code
[07:42:14] <anli_> Does overuse of .live make a zillion of event handlers to affect the performance of creating elements with $('<foo>');
[07:42:20] <anli_> Should do
[07:42:44] <Eviltwin> .live doesn't make a zillion event handlers
[07:42:44] <anli_> oops, I meant $('<foo/>');, and lets assume foo is a valid tag name
[07:42:50] <udp> anli_: huh?  it only creates one event handler, and then determines if each event matches
[07:42:52] <anli_> One per call
[07:42:59] <AdvoWork> is anyone aware of a plugin/function that will enable me to sort of hide some text within a <td> ? ie if ive got a big description, i want to hide some of it based on char count or something?
[07:43:00] <anli_> I said overuse
[07:43:02] <udp> *element matches
[07:43:03] <Eviltwin> In fact .live will only produce one event handler
[07:43:30] <Eviltwin> anli_: You only should call .live once per "behavior"
[07:43:33] <anli_> yes
[07:43:38] <Eviltwin> Like look at my example
[07:43:43] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/8Vp8X/
[07:43:46] <anli_> And there are many "behaviours"
[07:44:00] <Eviltwin> Okay, let's recap real quick
[07:44:05] <_ikke_> AdvoWork: look at css overflow elipsis
[07:44:25] <Eviltwin> If you have more than three event listeners with the same behavior, use .delegate
[07:44:45] <Eviltwin> If you can
[07:44:48] <udp> Eviltwin: why three?
[07:44:49] <Eviltwin> And you can't always
[07:44:54] <anli_> udp: Good point
[07:45:04] <udp> not really, just curious where the figure comes from
[07:45:13] <Eviltwin> udp: Someone wrote a good article where they did a lot of performance tests with .live and .delegate
[07:45:17] <anli_> <3 is many
[07:45:46] <Eviltwin> And found that on the average page, the benefits of .live and .delegate outweighed the overhead when there were more than 3
[07:46:27] <anli_> When I want to create new elements, I often do that when I create a dialog, so I have a html string for that dialog and use $() to create an element structure, then I use div.find('.ok').click( for instance to set a click handler for a button with the class ok
[07:46:44] <_ikke_> IE drives me nuts
[07:46:50] <udp> Eviltwin: Interesting.  I wonder if it makes a difference when I have craploads of elements
[07:47:03] <udp> since then surely .closest would start to get slower
[07:47:14] <anli_> So I dont have to think a lot about the future, creating element handlers for non-existing elements
[07:47:26] <anli_> Which seems to be the wrong order to do things
[07:47:58] <udp> anli_: not if your elements are created on the fly
[07:48:02] <_ikke_> I still can't get any keyup event :-/
[07:48:11] <udp> besides, all your code is written for elements that don't exist yet :p
[07:48:11] <Nomikos> _ikke_: can you post a jsfiddle ?
[07:48:22] <anli_> They will be created "on the fly" using var div = $(the_html_string);
[07:48:32] <_ikke_> Nomikos: I'll try
[07:48:39] <anli_> Which I use to make shorter like var div = $(html);
[07:48:43] <_ikke_> Nomikos: But not sure if I can reproduce the same circumstances
[07:49:01] <Nomikos> _ikke_: then focus on what's different, that makes one case work and the other not
[07:49:40] <Eviltwin> udp: Wait, what?
[07:49:47] <Eviltwin> "closest" would start to get slower?
[07:49:55] <udp> maybe I misunderstand how live works?
[07:50:52] <Eviltwin> So you've likely heard that selectors can be slow
[07:51:03] <Nilson> ANyone care to help me figure out why my pager (1,2,3 links) are only clickable if I place it above the slideshow containter?
[07:51:05] <Eviltwin> Namely ones like $("[name^=foo]")
[07:51:08] <Nilson> http://xpressmr.downtimeconsulting.com/test
[07:51:12] <Nilson> Im stumped
[07:51:13] <udp> well yes, I don't do anything like that
[07:51:32] <Eviltwin> It's slow because it has to go to every element in the page and check if that matches
[07:51:34] <udp> but if I have deeply nested elements
[07:51:37] <udp> and lots of them
[07:51:56] <Eviltwin> However, if you do $(document).delegate("[name^=foo]","click",function(){...})
[07:52:01] <Eviltwin> It's actaully not slow at all
[07:52:08] <Eviltwin> Because what happens
[07:52:08] <Nomikos> Nilson: ?
[07:52:12] <udp> come to think of it, there wouldn't be many to check
[07:52:13] <Eviltwin> Is every time you click an element
[07:52:19] <udp> as it only has to look at the target element and parents
[07:52:22] <udp> hmm
[07:52:23] <Eviltwin> It just checks that one element to see if it matches
[07:52:30] <Eviltwin> And then up as it bubbles, yes
[07:52:33] <anli_> Eviltwin:: selection based on attribute value is not good anyway
[07:52:54] <Eviltwin> anli_: It's great that you've decided that but why do you think so?
[07:53:02] <Nilson> Nomikos, trying to learn the jquery cycle plugin... As you can see I've created a pager element (div#nav) but it seems that I can not even click on the elements inside it in its current position
[07:53:02] <udp> currently I'm post processing my templates and binding things properly
[07:53:09] <anli_> Eviltwin: Dont you think classes are better?
[07:53:19] <udp> which is why I'm interested
[07:53:26] <Eviltwin> anli_: I think classes are classes and attributes are attributes
[07:53:41] <anli_> Eviltwin: I also think that, but we talk about selection by using one or another
[07:53:55] <_ikke_> Nomikos: The thing I create in jsfiddle just works :-/
[07:54:11] <Eviltwin> anli_: W3C doesn't add selectors it thinks are a bad practice
[07:54:11] <_ikke_> http://jsfiddle.net/LcxRA/2/
[07:54:30] <udp> anli_: what if you want to select only checkboxes?
[07:54:44] <anli_> $(':checkbox')
[07:54:49] <Nilson> hmm looks like it is a zindex problem
[07:54:55] <Nilson> the slideshow is covering it up
[07:55:09] <Eviltwin> anli_: If you want to style all <A> tags that have an href, you don't want to have to add a class to each of those as well
[07:55:15] <Eviltwin> That'd be duplicating that information
[07:55:24] <Eviltwin> Instead you just want to do a[href] { ... }
[07:55:24] <udp> anli_: "Because :checkbox is a jQuery extension and not part of the CSS specification, queries using :checkbox cannot take advantage of the performance boost provided by the native DOM querySelectorAll() method. For better performance in modern browsers, use [type="checkbox"] instead."
[07:55:44] <anli_> I think some kind of duplication is sound actually, classes are very good on conveying a boolean state
[07:55:45] <udp> interesting, I'd never used the :checkbox selector before either
[07:56:02] <pl0sh> hey guys, how can I remove a some characters in a given string? i.e. I have 21453,32154 and I want to remove either the first before the , or the second - note: it could be more than 2 blocks of comma separated..
[07:56:08] <anli_> You can also use :text, :hidden, :radio
[07:56:09] <Nomikos> Nilson: I suck at CSS, sorry
[07:56:36] <anli_> Well, radio buttons is something I hate, I use checkboxes instead
[07:56:46] <anli_> With some code to make them exclusive
[07:56:56] * sadmicrowave is back
[07:56:57] <Eviltwin> anli_: You realize that pseudo selectors aren't any more efficient than attribute selectors, right?
[07:57:07] <Eviltwin> I don't know where you've come to decide that attribute selectors are bad
[07:57:17] <Eviltwin> They're part of modern browsers
[07:57:17] <udp> there's nothing wrong with a slow selector providing you're not running it through every element on the page
[07:57:25] <anli_> Should be, because I assume that :checkbox first seeks for elements that are <input>
[07:57:32] <anli_> And the DOM has a shortcut for that
[07:57:34] <udp> using it to narrow a small selection you already have is fine
[07:57:38] <ajpiano> anli_: it doesn't.
[07:57:38] <Eviltwin> :checkbox is slower than [type="checkbox"] in a modern browser
[07:57:54] <ajpiano> anli_: you should stop making assumptions about performance and best practises based on "what already feels good to you"
[07:58:05] <anli_> getElementsByTagName
[07:58:24] <Michael> pl0sh: replace(/\d{1,2},/, '') would remove 1 or 2 digits before the comma
[07:58:26] <anli_> Should I not make an assumption that that function is used by jquery?
[07:58:29] <khmer_> i don't like those pseudoclasses
[07:58:30] <khmer_> http://jsperf.com/jquery-pseudoclasses-vs-attribute-selectors
[07:58:43] <grosboulet> Hello
[07:58:52] <ajpiano> anli_: the :checkbox selector simply does not pre-filter for tagName first
[07:58:59] <anli_> I actually dont give a shit about performance until it hits, me, so :checkbox is fine
[07:59:11] <Eviltwin> anli_: Then stop telling other people what to do
[07:59:14] <anli_> ajpiano: ok, then it maybe does in upcoming versions of jquery?
[07:59:14] <ajpiano> ^^
[07:59:16] <khmer_> how much harder is [type=checkbox]
[07:59:17] <Eviltwin> Since other people do care
[07:59:19] <ajpiano> anli_: it never does
[07:59:36] <anli_> Eviltwin: Did I?
[07:59:41] <ajpiano> anli_: and the jquery team is much more disposed to getting rid of custom selectors like :checkbox than improving them
[08:00:05] <anli_> I did not tell people what do use, you told me what to NOT use
[08:00:05] <Eviltwin> "< anli_> Eviltwin:: selection based on attribute value is not good anyway"
[08:00:16] <Eviltwin> You told me it wasn't good
[08:00:19] <anli_> thats my opinion, people are still free to use them
[08:00:22] <Eviltwin> And that's simply not the case
[08:00:33] <Eviltwin> It's better performance-wise
[08:00:40] <Nomikos> pesky facts..
[08:00:50] <anli_> If you want to discuss this using a performance perspective, I am out, I only want to write good code
[08:01:03] <Eviltwin> So good code isn't code that performs well?
[08:01:07] <Eviltwin> If so, what is it?
[08:01:10] <anli_> Eviltwin: very seldom, it is
[08:01:28] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: good code is "code that i intuitively feel is correct", obviously.
[08:01:35] <anli_> Good code is code that looks pretty, and $(':checkbox'); is prettier than $('input[type=checkbox']);
[08:01:41] <snover> good code is com.enterprise.generators.code.AbstractFunctionGeneratorFactoryClassFunction
[08:01:47] <anli_> haha
[08:02:03] <anli_> snover: you can continue the education from now on ;)
[08:02:05] <udp> anli_: I disagree, the latter is prettier because it describes how you'd look for other attributes too
[08:02:27] <anli_> But when looking for the attribute type, you dont look for other attributes
[08:02:31] <Eviltwin> So $(":checkbox").live("click",function(){...}) is better than $(document).delegate(":checkbox","click",function(){...}), right?
[08:02:36] <Eviltwin> Because it looks prettier in the first?
[08:03:06] <anli_> Hm, its like comparing two piles of shit to me, sorry to say it
[08:03:17] <anli_> I dont want to hurt your feelings however
[08:03:18] <udp> ...
[08:03:27] <anli_> Dont care about what I think
[08:03:34] <anli_> You have the truth already
[08:03:38] <Eviltwin> I see, so anli_'s never written more than 20 characters of code before
[08:03:42] <snover> be nice.
[08:03:57] <anli_> I try to be nice, sorry then
[08:04:14] <anli_> Or maybe you talked about Eviltwin, snover? :)
[08:04:20] <snover> everybody.
[08:04:23] <anli_> true
[08:04:48] <anli_> Its counter productive to write something like "you have never written more than 20 characters of code before"
[08:04:49] <jbeach> Eviltwin, $(':checkbox') is very inefficient
[08:04:53] <jbeach> can you constrain it?
[08:04:53] <anli_> Its much like a sandbox argument
[08:05:06] <jbeach> $('#someelmenet').find(':checkbox')
[08:05:08] <anli_> $(':checkbox') is char effective
[08:05:21] <snover> please move on, this discussion is not worthwhile
[08:05:25] <Nomikos> ^
[08:05:27] <anli_> $('#someelement :checkbox); that is
[08:05:45] <snover> :checkbox goes against all best practices but if you want to use it thatâ€™s fine, please just stop going on about it :)
[08:05:54] <ajpiano> anli_: optimsiing for your own performance typing the characters is the wrong perf to optimise - and snover's right, let's move on
[08:06:26] <Eviltwin> Optimizing chars is fine if the code's only ever running once
[08:06:37] <ajpiano> or it has to fit in a tweet
[08:06:37] <Eviltwin> Which is why I'll use Perl instead of C when writing a one-off
[08:06:41] <anli_> I have never created slow javascript and I use :checkbox, when you have proved your point we can continue discuss this, but for now, I agree, its not worth discussing
[08:06:50] <khmer_> i...i posted a jsperf
[08:06:56] <khmer_> i'm not interested in character assassination
[08:06:58] <khmer_> at least not right now
[08:07:00] <khmer_> you'll know when i am
[08:07:03] <snover> boom.
[08:07:05] <anli_> haha
[08:07:08] <khmer_> but you asked for proof and i mean there it is!
[08:07:09] <NoiseEee> call me when we're talking world leader assassination
[08:07:13] <khmer_> http://jsperf.com/jquery-pseudoclasses-vs-attribute-selectors
[08:07:59] <anli_> What you need to prove is not only that computers will be able to measure the time difference, but also that a human being would be able to notice the difference
[08:08:14] <khmer_> oh so you want a usability study
[08:08:21] <anli_> hm, yeah!
[08:08:22] <khmer_> i'm happy to conduct one for you
[08:08:27] <udp> khmer_: wow, that's quite dramatic
[08:08:27] <khmer_> that'll be $50,000 please
[08:08:30] <anli_> haha
[08:08:35] <jbeach> khmer_ greate test, thx
[08:08:39] <anli_> usability is the keyword
[08:09:28] <anli_> I like how you created the test case that fast
[08:09:45] <snover> the goalposts here keep shifting, which would be good except that they keep shifting over the same conversation that should have ended already
[08:09:46] <khmer_> there's a site for people who don't think they can predict how well something will perform
[08:09:50] <khmer_> it's called jsperf
[08:10:14] <anli_> I never select on the whole document, so I have really short sub DOM:s
[08:10:20] <anli_> To search for elements
[08:10:28] <anli_> Which makes the difference less noticable for the user
[08:10:41] <anli_> However, thats not for doing the code faster, it only becomes better
[08:10:56] <snover> ajpiano: So how about those #JETS
[08:11:01] <ajpiano> :(
[08:11:14] <ajpiano> my heartsrings, you tug them
[08:11:37] <snover> All I know about the #JETS is whatever you tweet, my friend
[08:11:58] <ajpiano> well, the last thing i tweeted was "8 more minutes of mediocrity" :/
[08:12:08] <dr0id> I herd jquery sucks
[08:12:11] <dr0id> is that true ?
[08:12:17] <Michael> Aren't jets out?
[08:12:19] <_ikke_> troll alert
[08:12:24] <Nomikos> dr0id: watch it, or I'll invite #web in here
[08:12:24] <ajpiano> what's a jquery suck, and where do they live in the wild?
[08:12:25] <Michael> Got killed by Miamia right?
[08:12:36] <anli_> "troll alert" is trolling in itself, isnt it? ;)
[08:12:36] <dr0id> heh
[08:12:38] <ajpiano> Michael: got killed by themselves :/
[08:12:40] <Michael> I can't talk though. My Eagles went 8-8 too
[08:12:49] <Michael> ajpiano: I understand :/
[08:12:57] <snover> ajpiano: thatâ€™s illegal in most states, you should maybe contact the DA
[08:13:48] <ajpiano> on it
[08:13:57] <dr0id> do you play piano ajpiano ?
[08:14:09] <ajpiano> yes
[08:14:15] <dr0id> I play flute
[08:14:20] <ajpiano> skin?
[08:14:26] <dr0id> yeah
[08:14:27] <anli_> dr0id: jquery sucks when it comes to playing the flute
[08:15:11] <anli_> dr0id: when you want to create a dynamic web application, its king
[08:15:19] <snover> anli_: no it isnâ€™t
[08:15:29] <anli_> Isnt it?
[08:15:31] <snover> when you are trying to create a static web site with some animations and ajax and shit, it is
[08:15:36] <anli_> Haha
[08:15:45] <anli_> A static web site does not use ajax
[08:15:51] <jbeach> anli_ find() is better than a single, scoped selector
[08:15:51] <jbeach> http://jsperf.com/jquery-scope-or-find
[08:16:08] <dr0id> what do you use for dynamic web applications then ?
[08:16:15] <jbeach> *loves jsperf!*
[08:16:16] <anli_> jbeach: I use foo.find(selector) instead of $(selector, foo);
[08:16:17] <Nomikos> assembly. Because it has to be fast.
[08:16:26] <dr0id> good one :P
[08:16:35] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/CWme9/
[08:16:37] <anli_> But I assume the performance is the same
[08:16:48] <matjas> jbeach: :)
[08:17:01] <matjas> glad you like it
[08:17:02] <jbeach> anli_ ah, was just responding to your $('#someelment :checkbox') comment above
[08:17:06] <risky_s> hi
[08:17:07] <jbeach> I didn't know which was faster
[08:17:08] <anli_> div.find('#foo').find('.bar'); is longer to type than div.find('#foo bar');
[08:17:18] <risky_s> has anyone used the i_select plugin ?
[08:17:29] <Eviltwin> Are we seriously back to the typing thing again
[08:17:44] <anli_> jbeach: Ah, that one, well, I think the readability of the code actually is better when not using two finds
[08:18:06] <Nomikos> I think readability of code is very subjective..
[08:18:15] <jbeach> finds also use pushStack(), which is nice
[08:18:23] <jbeach> for chaining
[08:18:23] <khmer_> jquery is an amazing swiss army knife, which is not fantastic for building a house
[08:18:24] <xec> i usually find short selectors to be more readable
[08:18:24] <anli_> But maybe the precences of a sub search is a signal that you performs a search on a two big dom structure
[08:18:29] <anli_> oops
[08:18:29] <xrated> CamelCase is the best case
[08:18:29] <snover> I think you guys are having fun tilting at windmills
[08:18:31] <anli_> a too big
[08:18:32] * xrated runs away from the shit storm
[08:18:33] <anli_> not two
[08:18:43] <khmer_> i'm using ember now, which is crazy so far
[08:18:51] <Eviltwin> I think optimizing for characters is what you do when you don't know how to optimize
[08:18:58] <khmer_> but has the potential to be more robust than backbone
[08:19:29] <anli_> Eviltwin: I was a lot of a performance optimizer a long time ago, now I think thats wasteful and have not given me that much
[08:19:32] <snover> khmer_: dojo already is :)
[08:19:40] <anli_> I coded in asm instead of C, for instance
[08:19:51] <khmer_> snover: dojo's too opinionated for me, i dunno
[08:19:53] <Eviltwin> anli_: So...you've regressed?
[08:19:57] <khmer_> snover: we rejected it
[08:19:59] <anli_> no, improved, as you will
[08:20:01] <Eviltwin> To the point where you'll intentionally choose the slower path?
[08:20:09] <snover> khmer_: dojoâ€™s opinion is â€œitâ€™s just javascriptâ€, thatâ€™s not very opinionated
[08:20:12] <Michael> Can't write device drivers in pure C :P
[08:20:21] <anli_> yes, maybe I intentionally chose a slower path, if the difference is not noticeable
[08:20:33] <jbeach> khmer_ crazy good or crazy bad? (re:ember)
[08:20:37] <khmer_> snover: hmph.
[08:20:46] <khmer_> jbeach: crazy good i think!
[08:20:51] <udp> anli_: but the C compiler is probably better at optimising than you are
[08:20:51] <anli_> Or if the difference would be possible to optimize anyway with a good enough runtime environment, maybe that runtime environment is not in existence today
[08:21:05] <Eviltwin> anli_: Do you think a second is noticeable compared to 2 milliseconds?
[08:21:21] <anli_> udp: most asm coders think they are better to optimize than a C compiler, else the you have been C coders instead
[08:21:34] <sphinxxx> if you have a $.get  in your DOM ready, does that info that gets pulled (let's say from an xml file)  get indexed or seen by search engines?
[08:21:48] <anli_> Eviltwin: yes, I think that
[08:21:51] <khmer_> sphinxxx: no
[08:21:51] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: JavaScript isn't run by search engines
[08:22:07] <udp> sphinxxx: yes
[08:22:07] <Pilate> not true, google crawls ajax now
[08:22:21] <khmer_> whoa! i didn't know that
[08:22:21] <khmer_> awesome
[08:22:30] <khmer_> but only ajax run on ready or load?
[08:22:39] <sphinxxx> i would think so
[08:23:00] <NoiseEee> they also awesomely mangle get and post! (google crawls)
[08:23:01] <laughahol> i'm trying to create a (pretty much) stock jqmodal but it only comes out as a blank square on the side and darkens the page
[08:23:21] <NoiseEee> (  http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/11/get-post-and-safely-surfacing-more-of.html )
[08:23:24] <laughahol> <div id='select_hostfiles'><a href='#' id='select_hostfile_popup'>Select</a></div><div class='jqmWindow' id='gah'><p>blah</p><div><p>blah</p></div></div>
[08:23:44] <Eviltwin> I see Google's recommendations for making AJAX applications crawlable
[08:23:47] <laughahol>   $('#gah').jqm({trigger: '#select_hostfile_popup'});
[08:23:58] <Eviltwin> But it seems to be the same as making it work in `links`
[08:23:59] <laughahol> anyone know what to do?
[08:24:30] <anli_> Wow, what a big script google puts in the top instead of including it
[08:24:43] <anli_> two scripts actually
[08:24:59] <laughahol> anli_, prevents people from being able to exclude it
[08:25:09] <Eviltwin> anli_: You know that inlining means that only one request needs to happen before the page loads, right?
[08:25:10] <anli_> how would they do that?
[08:25:11] <mug> hi, when do people normally use jquery.tmpl?
[08:25:21] <anli_> Eviltwin: you know that 2 is more than 1, right?
[08:25:25] <anli_> hehe
[08:25:29] <Eviltwin> anli_: Take a look at this: http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/
[08:25:32] <anli_> Sorry for answering in that way
[08:25:54] <Eviltwin> Specifically this: http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/rules_intro.html
[08:26:02] <anli_> Isnt http 1.1 handling the multiple requests overhead?
[08:26:16] <anli_> I know that cached scripts are really fast
[08:26:24] <anli_> ...to load
[08:26:28] <udp> anli_: you mean pipelining?  not really
[08:26:33] <anli_> ok
[08:26:59] <anli_> I am still not convinced including that bunch of script together with html is good
[08:27:34] <Eviltwin> It decreases the number of round trips
[08:27:36] <anli_> hm
[08:27:48] <anli_> even if the script is cached by the browser?
[08:27:56] <Eviltwin> Depends on how its cached
[08:28:19] <Eviltwin> I recommend you read the pagespeed docs
[08:28:25] <Eviltwin> As they explain a lot of the reasons for the various techniques
[08:28:31] <Eviltwin> And also read this: http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html
[08:28:37] <anli_> You mean that there is some way of caching thats better than inlining js in html like google did?
[08:28:55] <snover> Eviltwin: reading researched article is boring, I would rather make up baseless claims instead and then change my position when you refute them
[08:29:19] <anli_> I thought the answer "Depends on how its cached" was correct
[08:29:22] <Eviltwin> anli_: It's better not to inline a script used by multiple pages
[08:29:31] <anli_> true
[08:29:32] <Eviltwin> anli_: Caching can work in one of two ways
[08:29:50] <Eviltwin> One form of caching checks with the server to see if the file has changed and if it hasn't it uses what was in the cache
[08:30:04] <anli_> I know about the If-Modified-Since header
[08:30:08] <Michael> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag
[08:30:09] <Eviltwin> As a result, not a lot of data has to go back and forth and as soon as  there is a change, the browser picks it up
[08:30:16] <anli_> Or if that was the correct name, I dont remember
[08:30:23] <Eviltwin> However, there's still a round-trip there
[08:30:35] <Eviltwin> It needs to wait for the time it takes to send the request to the server and for the response to come back
[08:30:39] <anli_> yes, but if the other way of caching is used, then its never good to put that bunch of js in html
[08:30:54] <Eviltwin> And it's that time that Google gets back by inlining
[08:31:06] <Eviltwin> If the other caching is used, you risk the cache getting stale
[08:31:19] <anli_> Not if you put a version number on js files
[08:31:19] <Eviltwin> The reason that inlining is probably the right solution here is two-fold
[08:31:32] <Eviltwin> 1) It seens relatively small
[08:31:50] <Eviltwin> 2) The page as a whole will get cached and the inlined code seems to only be on the index page
[08:31:55] <Peeter> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8715333/json-with-x26-in-values-breaks-phps-json-encode
[08:32:33] <Eviltwin> anli_: The problem is there's no right answer for every situation
[08:32:33] <anli_> Eviltwin: but the page as such can only be cached in way 1
[08:32:38] <anli_> true true
[08:32:52] <Chopps> hey guys is there any way to reload the content of a div?? the div only contains one php echo
[08:32:53] <Eviltwin> anli_: It's constantly a balance between reusing large scripts and inlining small scripts
[08:33:01] <Eviltwin> And deciding what makes a script large or small
[08:33:06] <Nomikos> Chopps: sure, ajax
[08:33:12] <anli_> It also hurt my eyes, but I understand that google needs to take performance seriously
[08:33:12] <Eviltwin> And also optimizing between first load and second, third, fourth load etc
[08:33:26] <Eviltwin> anli_: Ah, but that's where the real magic is
[08:33:35] <Eviltwin> anli_: Google doesn't write it all in line like that
[08:33:41] <Eviltwin> They write it separately
[08:33:44] <anli_> ok
[08:33:51] <Eviltwin> Then their pagespeed tool puts it together
[08:33:55] <anli_> aha
[08:33:59] <anli_> thats nice
[08:34:07] <Eviltwin> mod_pagespeed
[08:34:07] <anli_> Even if it seems complicated
[08:34:08] <Nomikos> Google loves inline: http://www.google.com/foo
[08:34:09] <anli_> ok
[08:34:10] <Eviltwin> It's an Apache plugin
[08:34:21] <anli_> shall read up on that
[08:34:23] <Kzim> hey
[08:34:39] <offskin> Am using Fancybox (inline content). Have a twitter and FB widget in the content. They work first time, but when the fancybox is closed and the content is moved back to its original location in the DOM, they break, i.e. dont show in subsequent fancy boxes. Anyone know how to fix?
[08:35:12] <Eviltwin> anli_: I tried it out in beta and it made my site perform a lot better
[08:35:13] <Kzim> i want fill a select that is in an ajaxed div. what is the best way ? can i access a previous stored list in the from the ajaxed div ?
[08:35:20] <anli_> aha
[08:35:31] <Eviltwin> anli_: But it was early and they still had a few bugs here and there so I stopped using it
[08:35:35] <Eviltwin> I should try it again
[08:35:38] <anli_> download performance is a separate thing however, but its worth taking into consideration
[08:35:43] <anli_> ok
[08:36:04] <Eviltwin> On those two docs I linked, they explain their reasoning for everything
[08:36:09] <Chopps> thanks nokimos, will give it a go, i though there was another easier way
[08:36:26] <Eviltwin> So I recommend reading those if you want to understand the choices that come in to play
[08:36:29] <Eviltwin> And which choice to make
[08:36:30] <anli_> ok
[08:36:35] <Nomikos> Chopps: it might depend on what you mean with "reload" ?
[08:37:13] <anli_> Wonder if it applies a lot to my way to creating webpages, not using <form> but only ajax
[08:37:18] <Chopps> i will explain the issue im having hehe, maybe u guys can give me a better solution
[08:38:58] <anli_> I like how nearly all content on google is made with script
[08:39:03] <Eviltwin> anli_: That applies for browsers that don't have JavaScript
[08:39:19] <anli_> Ah
[08:39:32] <anli_> If it only applies to such browsers, then why care about it?
[08:39:40] <Michael> It feels like mod_pagespeed should be a fail safe
[08:39:45] <anli_> ok
[08:40:26] <jeffsmykil> what is the preferred alternative to .next().next()?
[08:40:42] <Eviltwin> anli_: Using $.ajax instead of actual <form>s will break browsers without JavaScript
[08:40:50] <Woet> jeffsmykil: .nextUntil
[08:40:56] <anli_> But browsers without javascript, what is that? ;)
[08:41:19] <pl0sh> Michael: the problem is that, maybe in sometimes it would be before, and sometimes it will be after the comma
[08:41:31] <Eviltwin> A lot of mobile browers for dumb phones don't have JavaScript
[08:41:46] <Eviltwin> And some people used to turn JS off when people only used it to do annoying effects
[08:41:46] <anli_> Oh, but most mobile phone browsers does
[08:41:47] <Chopps> i have a tabbed layout, each tab contains a datagrid(jqgrid), but then i load the page, only the grid on the displayed tab will display correctly, the grids on the other tabs display like this http://gyazo.com/a1183a5c6db5ae5219432ce5e4daecd8.png so i want to reload the display div to make the grid appear as it should http://gyazo.com/e628f6b332b65458959e999f62794cc7.png
[08:42:07] <Eviltwin> Less of a worry now
[08:42:22] <anli_> Actually, I built a webpage without knowing about the quality of mobile browers, then a friend was testing to run it on his iphone, worked well
[08:42:23] <Michael> pl0sh: So what determines which?
[08:42:30] <Eviltwin> And AJAX forms are better when it makes sense to use them
[08:42:36] <Eviltwin> When there's still something more to do on the page after submitting the form
[08:42:38] <xrated> anli_, if you make your websites well they'll usually look decent on mobile
[08:42:45] <illourr> hi
[08:42:51] <Eviltwin> But I always like to make it work without JavaScript too just in case
[08:43:15] <anli_> xrated: My point is that the scripts, which almost build up the whole webpage was running flawlessly
[08:43:29] <jeffsmykil> Woet:  that seems to give me all of those class insteafd of just that one
[08:43:45] <pl0sh> Michael: I have two vars, the one with the comma separated values, and the one with the value I want to remove from that string
[08:43:51] <xrated> Oh, on modern smart phones yes. Things might go weird on dumb phones or even feature phones.
[08:43:55] <anli_> browsers without javascript falls into the same category as web safe colors to me, have a nice evening, time for me to go home
[08:44:21] <Woet> jeffsmykil: . nextAll().eq(1) for 2x .next
[08:44:22] <bobbobbins> im still having the same trouble as last night...i have a .load call that pulls in a div with a bunch of <select> menus on it, and im using .on('change') on them, but the on is being ignored...i thought .on was supposed to work even when new elements are added
[08:44:47] <Kingsy> so does no-one in here support ie6 anymore?
[08:44:48] <Michael> pl0sh: rubular.com is a fun site to experiment with regex
[08:45:10] <Michael> It's ruby but still easy enough to tweak for JS
[08:45:20] <pl0sh> alright, thanks
[08:45:22] <Michael> np
[08:45:24] <Chopps> Nomikos,  i have a tabbed layout, each tab contains a datagrid(jqgrid), but then i load the page, only the grid on the displayed tab will display correctly, the grids on the other tabs display like this http://gyazo.com/a1183a5c6db5ae5219432ce5e4daecd8.png so i want to reload the display div to make the grid appear as it should http://gyazo.com/e628f6b332b65458959e999f62794cc7.png
[08:45:42] <jeffsmykil> Woet: wouldn't that be slower than next().next()?
[08:46:00] <bobbobbins> without the .load call it works fine
[08:46:00] <Woet> jeffsmykil: not sure, it would seem like it is
[08:46:21] <jeffsmykil> thanks woet
[08:46:40] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: The reason there's no short way to get the nth sibling after me
[08:46:41] <Woet> jeffsmykil: i think .next().next() is fine
[08:46:50] <sadmicrowave> jeffsmykil, jspref it
[08:46:53] <Eviltwin> Is that generally it means you've structured something wrong
[08:47:20] <jeffsmykil> i see
[08:47:56] <bobbobbins> any help?
[08:47:59] <Eviltwin> Actually I wish .next worked differently
[08:48:11] <xrated> Eviltwin, why?
[08:48:17] <leo2007> Is there a way to download the jquery api doc for offline use?
[08:48:18] <Eviltwin> Where the selector meant it kept searching right until it found something that matched that selector
[08:48:33] <Nomikos> Chopps: hrm, never worked with datagrid; does it have a way to re-draw the table somehow?
[08:48:48] <Nomikos> Chopps: then you could trigger that on tab-change
[08:50:29] <Chopps> Nomikos i really have no idea, im using an php implementation of jqgrid (azgtech.wordpress.com/2010/08/01/jqgrid-php-datagrid/) but i will take a look at the js code and documentation
[08:50:44] <Nomikos> leo2007: try http://www.jqapi.com/
[08:51:00] <Nomikos> Chopps: good luck!
[08:52:34] <leo2007> Nomikos: thanks. What is AIR?
[08:52:59] <xrated> AIR is Adobe's cross-platform abortion
[08:53:07] <Nomikos> leo2007: uh.. *points at sky*
[08:53:11] <Nomikos> oh, right, that too
[08:54:42] <jita> I have an input field and a button, and i want onclick on that button so that it replaces the location, is there something like window.location.replace(http://foo/ + #input.value)?
[08:55:34] <Kit-10> window.location.href = 'http://foo/'+$(this).prev(':text');
[08:55:43] <Eviltwin> ?
[08:55:51] <Kit-10> if the button is next to the textfield
[08:55:52] <Michael> what if it's https?
[08:56:01] <Michael> (also href is not required)
[08:56:14] <Kit-10> helps to be precise
[08:56:20] <Eviltwin> I wonder if you could abuse the attr/prop feature of an <A> tag
[08:56:35] <Kit-10> and location is an object, location.href is a string
[08:56:54] <Michael> That doesn't change the fact that it isn't required.
[08:57:16] <Eviltwin> If I'm on http://www.example.com/foo/bar/xyz.html and I have an <a href="../www.html">, the attr is "../www.html" but the prop is http://www.example.com/foo/www.html
[08:58:57] <thirty6degrees> hi, anyone able to help with an issue with jQuery.serialize that's been bugging me all day?
[08:59:14] <xrated> fiddle it
[08:59:18] <jita> Kit-10, the button is next to the input field
[08:59:32] <thirty6degrees> i have - it works fine fiddled! :(
[08:59:42] <xrated> o.O
[08:59:55] <eugenmayer> is there a way wo make a case-insensitive compare with *= ?
[08:59:59] <xrated> Can we see the fiddle and you can describe your enviroment?
[09:00:36] <Eviltwin> eugenmayer: The attr selectors are pretty specific and somewhat limiting
[09:00:53] <Eviltwin> These are the ones that are available: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[09:01:12] <Eviltwin> And all but one of them is supported natively by modern browsers (and are therefore fast)
[09:01:19] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/bT5R4/ - anybody know why 1px of the entire right side of the zoomed image gets cut off?
[09:01:28] <troubleman> (jQuery Cloud Zoom)
[09:01:40] <eugenmayer> Eviltwin: iam there already .. there is no case switches
[09:02:00] <Michael> "Attribute values must be identifiers or strings. The case-sensitivity of attribute names and values in selectors depends on the document language."
[09:02:01] <Eviltwin> eugenmayer: If you want to do something else, you'll probably need to use a .filter and function
[09:02:04] <Michael> That's not really helpful
[09:02:18] <Eviltwin> eugenmayer: Which will be slow so try to make sure it's operating on as small a collection as possible
[09:03:45] <Eviltwin> eugenmayer: It can be pretty amazing how much faster the browser is at processing these selectors than using a JavaScript function
[09:03:49] <Eviltwin> Take this example: http://jsperf.com/crazy-selectors
[09:03:57] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/bT5R4/ - anybody know why 1px of the entire right side of the zoomed image gets cut off? (jQuery Cloud Zoom)
[09:04:37] <Eviltwin> Checking to see if an <A> tag's href contains /phpMyAdmin/ plus some extra character on the end
[09:04:47] <bobbobbins> basically nothing that is loaded in with my load call is being recognized with a .on() call
[09:04:54] <leo2007> when I open the downloaded api html files I can see a huge delay looks like it is still trying to connect to the web.
[09:05:03] <leo2007> My network is sucky.
[09:05:58] <jita> any idea why this isnt working ? <button type="submit" onclick="window.location.href = 'http://foo/?q='+$(this).prev(':text');"></button> ?
[09:06:32] <jita> <button type="submit" onclick="window.location.href = 'http://foo/?q='+$(this).prev(':text');"></button>?
[09:06:40] <jita> why this isnt working
[09:06:42] <jita> any idea ?
[09:07:00] <thirty6degrees> Fiddled: http://jsfiddle.net/WmQMv/
[09:07:08] <thirty6degrees> Error I get locally is: TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (near '...})...')
[09:07:35] <thirty6degrees> have got latest query (1.7.1) and been playing with it for most of the day, tried taking out various components (TinyMCE etc) but not sure what's going on :(
[09:07:53] <Kingsy> ok generic question then .. can someone tell me why this slider --> http://www.kingsy.co.uk/cooking4life/index.php <-- starts with a blank rather than the first image?
[09:07:54] <Eviltwin> thirty6degrees: Take a look at the left hand side of the fiddle
[09:07:57] <Eviltwin> Where it says "Choose Framework"
[09:08:22] <sadmicrowave> mootools baby
[09:08:28] <AdvoWork> if ive got <img src="whatever" class="test" id="1">  if im doing: $(".add").click(function(e) { }  how would I get the id of that?
[09:08:38] <jita> Kit-10, this isnt working <button type="submit" onclick="window.location.href = 'http://foo/?q='+$(this).prev(':text');"></button> any idea ?
[09:08:57] <udp> jita: stop spamming and make a jsfiddle
[09:09:14] <jita> udp, its just a single line
[09:09:22] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ jita
[09:09:22] <bot-t> jita, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[09:09:22] <Kingsy> lol nm
[09:09:30] <thirty6degrees> @eviltwin - totally didn't see that! thanks. but i'm loading in query manually as a resource anyway, and it works fine fiddled ;) issue i'm having exists locally, can't get the same thing to happen on jsfiddle
[09:09:32] <Eviltwin> jita: A jsFiddle lets us actually play with the code
[09:09:42] <Eviltwin> thirty6degrees: I think MooTools is overwriting the $ though
[09:09:50] <Eviltwin> thirty6degrees: Set it to No Library (Pure JS)
[09:09:53] <Eviltwin> And update
[09:09:57] <Eviltwin> And relink
[09:10:24] <jita> Eviltwin, is the syntax correct ?
[09:11:03] <thirty6degrees> http://jsfiddle.net/WmQMv/1/
[09:11:53] <AdvoWork> hmm, any idea why <img src="add-icon.png" class="add_product_to_po" id="74 " style="width:12px;"> and: $(".add_product_to_po").click(function(e) { alert(e);alert(e.id);	}); wouldnt do anything at all? no errors in firebug, but it wont alert anything
[09:12:28] <jedimind> fdoes add_product_to_po exist on page load ?
[09:12:33] <jedimind> or are you adding it to the dom later?
[09:13:28] <Eviltwin> jita: It's considered a bad practice to inline event handlers like that
[09:13:36] <m0dmd> sup jQuery crew
[09:13:53] <AdvoWork> jedimind, ahh good point, its added after that, by an ajax request loading it into datatables, is that why?
[09:14:06] <jedimind> yeah, AdvoWork
[09:14:09] <jedimind> try using .live instead
[09:14:14] <Eviltwin> No
[09:14:16] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live
[09:14:19] <AdvoWork> instead of .click?
[09:14:20] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate or .on
[09:14:24] <jedimind> oh right .live is dead now sorry
[09:14:31] <m0dmd> has anyone been able to update the data-text attr for tweet buttons via a custom input field?
[09:14:44] <AdvoWork> so $(".add_product_to_po").delegate(function(e ?
[09:14:46] <t4nkd> Can someone take a look here and tell me where I went wrong with variable scoping and possibly how to get at 'locations': https://gist.github.com/af5fdecb6ea17c93e4bc
[09:14:47] <jita> Eviltwin, can you tell me some resources where i can grasp the basics of jquery or client side scripting in general ?
[09:14:54] <thirty6degrees> @jedimind ironic, really :P
[09:15:02] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ jita
[09:15:02] <bot-t> jita, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[09:15:03] <jedimind> :)
[09:15:22] <jita> Eviltwin, thanks
[09:15:27] <m0dmd> got it..
[09:15:50] <jedimind> AdvoWork, $('element').on('click', function() { ... })
[09:15:51] <jita> Eviltwin, i have a book 'eloquent javascript', is it ok ?
[09:16:28] <Eviltwin> jita: Yeah, I've heard good things
[09:16:39] <Eviltwin> Just actually read it through :P
[09:16:48] <jita> ok thanks
[09:17:11] <jedimind> or better yet $('containing element').on('click', '.add_product_to_po', function() { ... })
[09:17:27] <thirty6degrees> @xrated http://cl.ly/012J1N3y453g36301o2k << this is the error'ing line in questionâ€¦ =/
[09:18:00] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: Here's an example of delegate in action: http://jsfiddle.net/8Vp8X/
[09:19:05] <Eviltwin> thirty6degrees: Why don't you pause and step through and make sure "this" is what you think it is there
[09:19:18] <AdvoWork> jedimind, i tried that, so: $(document).ready(function() {$('.add_product_to_po').on('click', function(e) {alert(e);alert(e.id);})   but when I do that, it stops my other code running for some reason, any suggestions?
[09:19:27] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, thanks, i'll take a look
[09:24:44] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, no errors with the code, but still when i try and click it, it won't alert. an example is: http://jsfiddle.net/8Vp8X/1/  if you click the green icon, nothing happens
[09:25:01] <jita> Eviltwin, should i start with javascript right ?
[09:25:39] <udp> AdvoWork: where are you using the "add" class?
[09:25:54] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/8Vp8X/2/
[09:26:01] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: He got it from my example
[09:26:14] <AdvoWork> udp, how do you mean?
[09:26:20] <Eviltwin> Err
[09:26:25] <Eviltwin> udp: He got it from my example
[09:26:26] <udp> you were using a class called "add" that wasn't present in the HTML
[09:26:28] <udp> ah
[09:26:42] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, hmm, why does yours work and mine not lol
[09:26:55] <hightekvagabond> because he is Eviltwin and you aren't
[09:26:56] <Eviltwin> 1) You had a syntax error
[09:27:21] <Eviltwin> 2) .delegate basically has two selectors involved
[09:27:39] <hazamonzo> Hey folks, I want to hover over an existing div and have a new div appear within the original div. Kinda like a tools popup. What might i google for this? Maybe there is already a sample or jquery UI function that will help me?
[09:27:44] <Eviltwin> The first is static and the second is dynamic
[09:27:54] <AdvoWork> ahh I see, thanks for the help!
[09:28:02] <Eviltwin> If you want it all to be dynamic
[09:28:08] <Eviltwin> You use $(document) as the first thing
[09:28:17] <Eviltwin> And put the whole selector in the second
[09:28:46] <troubleman> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[09:28:53] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/bT5R4/ - anybody know why 1px of the entire right side of the zoomed image gets cut off? (jQuery Cloud Zoom)
[09:28:58] <thirty6degrees> Thanks for your help guys, gonna spend some more time on it tonight and maybe see if sleep helps :P
[09:29:08] <Eviltwin> thirty6degrees: No, sory, it can't be done
[09:29:15] <Eviltwin> Err
[09:29:20] <Eviltwin> troubleman: No, sorry, it can't be done
[09:29:29] <thirty6degrees> lol
[09:29:32] <thirty6degrees> sleep can't be done?
[09:29:33] <thirty6degrees> damn
[09:29:45] <AdvoWork> Eviltwin, that makes sense, can i get the id from that same img element though? tried passing function(e) instead of just function() and using e.id but it returns undefined
[09:30:31] <Eviltwin> You know that the first argument is the event, not the element
[09:30:39] <troubleman> Eviltwin: cant be done??
[09:30:51] <troubleman> come on man
[09:30:56] <AdvoWork> oh really, doh, i took it from an online example, so ive probably miss interpreted it :/
[09:31:10] <Eviltwin> AdvoWork: "this" will be the element that was clicked
[09:31:38] <Eviltwin> Well
[09:31:43] <Eviltwin> It will be the element that was bound to
[09:31:56] <AdvoWork> thats fine, this.id works as i expected it to. Thanks again!
[09:31:57] <troubleman> Eviltwin: was u talking to me?
[09:33:10] <Eviltwin> troubleman: I saw your question and didn't respond originally as I don't do anything with Cloud Zoom
[09:33:27] <Eviltwin> And because no one else has
[09:33:39] <Eviltwin> I don't think they know how to fix it either
[09:34:36] <BrotherRodriguez> Question: I have a list of links that change dynamically. I bind click events to them when they're created. Is it best to remove the event when I remove the element from the page, or is this handled automatically?
[09:34:44] <troubleman> Eviltwin: stop misleading people
[09:34:46] <troubleman> twat
[09:34:49] <troubleman> eeeeeeeeeevil twat
[09:34:50] <Eviltwin> troubleman: I suggest you read through everything here: http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom-integration.htm
[09:35:00] <troubleman> man!
[09:35:04] <troubleman> i know how to integrate the damn thing
[09:35:08] <Eviltwin> Apparently not
[09:35:16] <Eviltwin> You keep trimming a pixel of
[09:35:17] <Eviltwin> f
[09:35:34] <Eviltwin> BrotherRodriguez: If you use .remove(), it's unbound automatically
[09:35:47] <troubleman> Eviltwin: its most likely a bug in cloud zoom
[09:35:50] <troubleman> so apparently yeah
[09:36:11] <BrotherRodriguez> thanks, I was using .remove()
[09:36:25] <Eviltwin> troubleman: Have you poked at adjustX?
[09:36:29] <BrotherRodriguez> I'm new to event handling and didn't want to create some sort of weird behavior
[09:36:46] <jeffsmykil> Does anyone know if IE thinks the text on input buttons is on a different element other than that of the button?
[09:36:48] <Eviltwin> BrotherRodriguez: jQuery took care of it for you
[09:37:08] <BrotherRodriguez> thanks jQuery!
[09:37:09] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: You mean <input type="button" value="Foo">?
[09:37:16] <Eviltwin> The "Foo" there?
[09:37:19] <troubleman> Eviltwin: yeah but id rather not hack it like that
[09:37:21] <jeffsmykil> yes Eviltwin
[09:37:22] <troubleman> nice observation though
[09:37:37] <Eviltwin> troubleman: How about you try it and see what happens
[09:37:50] <Michael> http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm
[09:37:53] <Michael> Why not leave a comment too?
[09:37:54] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: From JavaScript perspective, that shouldn't be considered a different node, no
[09:38:09] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: for some reason I think it is being treated as one
[09:38:18] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Do you have something to demonstrate this?
[09:38:27] <jeffsmykil> not that i can share
[09:38:38] <jeffsmykil> eviltwin what would be the selector for all children of input
[09:38:40] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Can you make a small jsFiddle or soemthing?
[09:38:41] <troubleman> Eviltwin: cool
[09:38:44] <Michael> jeffsmykil: Yes sometimes IE will interpret new lines as text nodes
[09:38:51] <troubleman> yeah that fixed it
[09:39:00] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: You can do .children() to get all child elements
[09:39:06] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Or .contents() to get all child nodes
[09:39:16] <Eviltwin> The distinction being that .contents() includes HTML comments and text nodes
[09:39:18] <Eviltwin> Etc
[09:39:19] <jeffsmykil> cant use that because it is in the function
[09:39:19] <troubleman> Eviltwin: but it pushes away the left side
[09:39:31] <Eviltwin> troubleman: Then sue the plugin makers
[09:39:42] <jeffsmykil> $("foo").onenter() {}
[09:39:46] <troubleman> twat
[09:39:47] <jeffsmykil> children of foo
[09:40:05] <Michael> troubleman: Would you please stop using that word?
[09:42:27] <Woet> Michael: but he's a paying customer, he can expect 24/7 enterprise jquery support with SLA's and he can curse at the supporters!
[09:42:58] <dnsdds> I have a jQuery function name in a variable; how can I call the function within a chain?
[09:43:43] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: something like .orange:nth-child(1)
[09:43:50] <Eviltwin> dnsdds: $("#foo").toggle().fadeOut(); can also be written as var a = "toggle"; $("#foo")[a]().fadeOut();
[09:44:13] <dnsdds> Eviltwin: Awesome, just what I was looking for, thanks!
[09:44:13] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: I'm not quite following
[09:44:29] <Eviltwin> dnsdds: More generically object.foo is the same as object['foo']
[09:45:09] <Michael> Woet: good point.
[09:45:36] <Woet> Michael: were you thinking this is an open source project, free of charge with community support?
[09:45:38] <Woet> how silly of you
[09:45:52] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/bT5R4/ - anybody know why 1px of the entire right side of the zoomed image gets cut off? (jQuery Cloud Zoom)
[09:45:53] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: I have a button.  When I mouse over the button the whole background goes black.  There is no padding on the button.  If I mous from the left or the right on to the text which is set in value="" the background does not go black
[09:46:05] <Michael> troubleman: The plugin's page has a comments box
[09:46:13] <Eviltwin> It amuses me when people come in here complaining about plugins
[09:46:20] <Michael> In the mean time of getting support here I think it would behoove you to fill that out
[09:46:27] <troubleman> Michael: true
[09:46:38] <troubleman> behoove?
[09:46:39] <troubleman> hehe
[09:46:49] <troubleman> what kinda word is that
[09:47:18] <Michael> A word used in diplomacy when biting ones' tongue.
[09:47:21] <Woet>  to be necessary, proper, or advantageous for
[09:47:59] <troubleman> interesting
[09:48:13] <Eviltwin> troubleman: I think you should switch over to #cloudzoom and wait for the support people there
[09:48:26] <troubleman> Eviltwin: nonsense there is no such channel
[09:48:40] <Michael> There is when you join it :D
[09:48:46] <troubleman> harr harr
[09:49:05] <troubleman> /join http://tuvaholm.blogg.no/
[09:49:08] <troubleman> err
[09:49:28] <Michael> Oh the accidental advertisement. I have to click on it
[09:49:57] <troubleman> no dont!!!
[09:50:02] <troubleman> shes only 17
[09:50:08] <Eviltwin> troubleman: Part of the problem may be that 550/315 = 1.746 and 840/480 = 1.75
[09:50:11] <Eviltwin> Just a guess
[09:50:31] <troubleman> Eviltwin: cool
[09:50:37] <troubleman> really cool
[09:50:50] <troubleman> yeah i was struggling to come up with nice round numbers for the dimensions while still keeping the ratio
[09:51:05] <Eviltwin> I would try something that's an exact ratio match
[09:51:08] <Eviltwin> And see if it's still there
[09:51:14] <Michael> why not floor/ceil?
[09:51:33] <Eviltwin> And if it isn't, report it as a bug in the comments
[09:53:00] <troubleman> thanks a lot Eviltwin
[09:53:26] <troubleman> damn
[09:53:36] <troubleman> wish there was a site that showed nice ratio matching sizes like that
[09:53:40] <troubleman> Michael: floor/ceil?
[09:54:15] <Michael> if ( (width/height) %1 !== 0) { val = Math.floor(val); }
[09:54:15] <Eviltwin> Floor rounds anything greater than or equal to 2.0 and strictly less than 3.0 to 2
[09:54:39] <Eviltwin> And ceil rounds anything strictly greater than 2.0 and less than or equal to 3.0 to 3
[09:55:15] <troubleman> nice but
[09:55:33] <Eviltwin> He's saying he thinks there's a rounding error inside cloud zoom
[09:55:38] <Eviltwin> (I think)
[09:55:58] <Eviltwin> Try it with nice ratios and see if there's still a problem
[09:56:28] <troubleman> yes indeed
[09:56:37] <troubleman> so far im using 60x90, 190x290, 315x480, 550x840
[09:56:46] <troubleman> nice and round
[09:57:06] <troubleman> i'd hate to break those curves if you know what i mean
[09:57:08] <Eviltwin> I would try something like 300x400 vs 600x800 if you can
[09:57:38] <Eviltwin> Nice 2:1 ratio on both axes
[09:57:44] <troubleman> hmmm
[09:58:30] <troubleman> so 50x100, 150x300, 250x500, 400x800?
[09:58:39] <Eviltwin> Try it
[09:58:39] <troubleman> i think that might be just a biiiit too much
[09:58:52] <troubleman> is there a way to ease down on the one side?
[09:59:01] <Eviltwin> Oh, I'm just saying for the purposes of seeing if the plugin still messes up
[09:59:11] <troubleman> oh like that
[09:59:15] <troubleman> sure okay 2 sec
[09:59:18] <Eviltwin> Either way you should report it as a problem in the comments
[09:59:26] <Eviltwin> But it's nice to be able to give them more information
[09:59:26] * troubleman is now playing: http://home.no/dwaynie/rhodes_ahead.mp3
[09:59:32] <troubleman> damnit sorry about that
[10:00:21] <hazamonzo> can anyone recommend a good and up to date jquery based caption library?
[10:00:35] <troubleman> unfortunately it doesn't seem to be that: http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/bT5R4/4/
[10:01:27] <qom2> clients.persturesson.com/dss/ â€“ I'd like to be able to resize the height of the images based on the browser size, ideas?
[10:01:34] <Eviltwin> troubleman: Bummer, you should report it as a bug then
[10:01:39] <sphinxxx> how do you catch the error event in a $.ajax call
[10:01:42] <troubleman> yup
[10:01:47] <sphinxxx> is there something built in, or do i have to use try, catch
[10:01:49] <troubleman> awaiting moderation
[10:01:55] <troubleman> thanks again though man
[10:02:04] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: You know how to catch success?
[10:02:25] <sphinxxx> yeah
[10:02:34] <Eviltwin> Instead of "success", "error"
[10:02:38] <qom2> http://clients.persturesson.com/dss/ sorry..
[10:02:42] <Eviltwin> ?$.ajax @ sphinxxx

[10:17:13] <jedimind> also i think we're off topic but we wont say anything until someone complains
[10:17:14] <jedimind> :)
[10:17:17] <abjorn> came from management
[10:20:28] <imsky> so you're staying at the gator then
[10:21:08] <shadykhan> i have a front-end developer interview next week any advice?
[10:21:35] <imsky> shadykhan: how to vertically center stuff without tables
[10:23:37] <abjorn> imsky: for now
[10:24:15] <imsky> word up baby
[10:25:45] <Eviltwin> shadykhan: When we were interviewing front-end people
[10:25:51] <Eviltwin> We brought them to an Amazon product page
[10:25:59] <Eviltwin> And asked them
[10:26:12] <Eviltwin> How to implement a number of things
[10:26:29] <Eviltwin> For example, when you scroll down, some content loads in just as you get to it
[10:26:35] <Eviltwin> Like the comments and whatnot
[10:27:00] <Eviltwin> And if you add something to your cart and immediately refresh, it doesn't get added twice
[10:27:21] <Eviltwin> And as you browse around the site, the cart keeps the things it had in it
[10:27:26] <Eviltwin> We asked them how to implement stuff like that
[10:27:30] <Eviltwin> How they would
[10:27:32] <shadykhan> ahhi see
[10:27:40] <Eviltwin> To get an idea of their problem solving
[10:27:52] <Eviltwin> I think our interviews were rather different from traditional ones though
[10:28:08] <shadykhan> well man i have to be prepared for anything
[10:28:18] <Eviltwin> We also tried to see if they would lie
[10:28:29] <shadykhan> the company im going for has some big clients
[10:28:44] <Eviltwin> "Are you familiar with the shard model of design?"
[10:28:54] <Eviltwin> Basically something we just made up
[10:29:01] <Michael> shadykhan: What big clients?
[10:29:03] <Eviltwin> To see if they said yes or not
[10:29:06] <shadykhan> for example
[10:29:11] <shadykhan> they did the whitehouse website
[10:29:13] <shadykhan> bears
[10:29:16] <Michael> Just curious if Disney is one of them :D
[10:29:16] <shadykhan> blackhawks
[10:29:49] <tfitts> Eviltwin: Do you work at amazson?
[10:29:56] <Eviltwin> tfitts: My boss used to
[10:30:06] <Eviltwin> Part of why we chose it
[10:30:10] <shadykhan> like i know i can do my job as a front end dev
[10:30:21] <Eviltwin> But we were just looking for something that works and asking them about the pieces that go into it
[10:30:25] <shadykhan> but im afraid from the interview
[10:30:31] <Eviltwin> Specific questions to get their minds working
[10:31:41] <shadykhan> i only had 2 job interviews for a front end job
[10:31:49] <shadykhan> one was just a simple interview the other was a code challenge
[10:32:13] <shadykhan> code challenge people said i didnt have enough team experience
[10:32:19] <shadykhan> so i didnt get it :/
[10:32:36] <Eviltwin> Did you have much of any team experience?
[10:32:57] <shadykhan> like 3 weeks worth when i got my first job at a startup
[10:33:06] <shadykhan> they had to let me go because thier client didnt pay and they had to let me go
[10:33:18] <Eviltwin> Teamwork is rather important
[10:33:29] <shadykhan> like im all for team work
[10:33:40] <shadykhan> i dont have experience at work for teamwork
[10:33:47] <Eviltwin> Did you do anything team-based in school?
[10:33:53] <shadykhan> out of work i play ball and football play games competitivly
[10:33:57] <Eviltwin> Sports? Debate? Theatre?
[10:33:58] <shadykhan> so i know how teams work
[10:34:04] <Eviltwin> Did you bring that up?
[10:34:13] <shadykhan> nah they didnt ask :/
[10:34:22] <shadykhan> this was a month ago
[10:34:25] <shadykhan> i mean i cant do anythinhg now
[10:34:39] <Eviltwin> If they ask about teamwork and you don't have programming teamwork experience, talk about other teamwork experience
[10:35:04] <shadykhan> for sure
[10:35:05] <Eviltwin> It really helps
[10:35:56] <shadykhan> evil can i send u the criteria of what they are looking for and what i should expect?
[10:36:01] <shadykhan> any advice would be awesome
[10:36:17] <Eviltwin> Well we aren't hiring currently and I'm not sure we have the criteria on paper
[10:36:29] <xrated> If I tell codesprint that I ran a small group of super heroes for a time, do you think that would help
[10:36:42] <shadykhan> well i mean the critera of the company im interviewing for
[10:36:50] <Eviltwin> Oh, I misread
[10:36:58] <Eviltwin> Sure, I can take a look
[10:37:11] <Eviltwin> Not sure I can give any more good advice though
[10:37:26] <shadykhan> i mean its worth a try
[10:38:37] <tfitts> xrated: is this WoW?
[10:39:02] <xrated> The soul sucking game
[10:39:07] * xrated is happy he doesn't play it anymore
[10:40:08] <tfitts> lol, I'd leave that bit out.  I heard that reasoning before from other Wow addicts.  It's a video game... hardly leadership experience.  But I see you know that now.
[10:40:58] <billwalton> how do i get to the event object on keydown when i bind the event object in the init function of a plugin?
[10:41:09] <billwalton> http://jsfiddle.net/fWzJh/
[10:41:32] <billwalton> event is undefined
[10:43:18] <xrated> tfitts, that game needs a warning on it
[10:43:28] <billwalton> all the examples i google up are outside a plugin
[10:43:38] <xrated> "In exchange for 15 USD and all your social relationships, you get to play this game"
[10:44:04] <billwalton> keydown fires the function, but event is undefined
[10:48:13] <sgrover> I need to convert a complex object to JSON.  Does jQuery have any facility for this?  Or do I just use the json2.js library?
[10:48:27] <sgrover> I'd prefer to not have to include another library if possible.
[10:48:34] <udp> depending on which browsers you're targeting, JSON.stringify
[10:48:54] <sgrover> udp: native browser support these days?
[10:49:04] <imsky> lol
[10:49:09] <Michael> ? toJSON
[10:49:10] <udp> probably not IE
[10:49:12] <bot-t> Michael, jQuery.parseJSON - Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[10:49:17] <Michael> hmm
[10:49:36] <udp> oh apparently IE 8 does
[10:49:39] <sgrover> Michael: I need the reverse
[10:49:39] <erichynds> IE8 has JSON.stringify
[10:49:41] <danzik17> sgrover: older versions of IE might not have it, but any newer browser will
[10:50:44] <Giverny> ajpiano witch is better
[10:51:28] <Eviltwin> If you're using jQuery and aren't including json2.js (and trust the JSON coming back), use jQuery.parseJSON
[10:51:29] <Michael> ajpiano: I want to know how bot-t crawls jquery.com :P
[10:51:35] <Michael> I want to add that to my bot
[10:51:39] <Eviltwin> Michael: How it crawls?
[10:51:49] <Michael> Yeah I don't think it has a REST api does it?
[10:51:54] <Michael> Is it using something like mechanize? etc
[10:52:00] <udp> Eviltwin: he wanted to convert an object to JSON, not JSON to an object
[10:52:06] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/<string>
[10:52:23] <Eviltwin> Or the search
[11:01:00] <photosbyme> hey all, some advice about using hover events on ipad
[11:01:28] <photosbyme> is it possible to write something that would give a silimar effect as hover?
[11:02:11] <Michael> that would be annoying
[11:02:49] <shesek> photosbyme, how do you define 'hover' on an iPad?
[11:03:04] <jedimind> yeah... how would that work exactly
[11:03:16] <shesek> hover is usually the mouse moving without being clicked. with the iPad its always "clicked" when its moved
[11:03:24] <shesek> so that's more like dragging an element
[11:04:28] <photosbyme> well the client wants the hover menu which it does here: www. bypinghe.com tried this  but nothing happens on the iphone: http://jsfiddle.net/BBLnE/
[11:04:39] <photosbyme> www.bypinghe.com\
[11:04:49] <billwalton> need help capturing the keydown event in a plugin
[11:05:00] <billwalton> http://jsfiddle.net/fWzJh/
[11:05:02] <jedimind> photosbyme, it would not be a hover event
[11:05:05] <jedimind> it would be a touch event
[11:05:10] <jedimind> or click event
[11:05:44] <photosbyme> well I would be quite happy if on the Ipad/Iphone the link was clicked and the menu appeared
[11:06:19] <JAAulde> I have a window with an element on which I've set some data via .data(). This window opens a popup interface which, at times, needs to look back at the opener and read the data from that same element it had been written to before. This does not work, though-while I can see it is the same element, asking for the ,data() from the popup returns undefined.
[11:06:54] <JAAulde> I assume this has to do with the unique identifier stuff which jQuery does from window to window, and how jQuery associates data to the ID
[11:07:14] <JAAulde> is there a way to get aorund this such that one window can ask for data from the element in another window?
[11:07:32] <photosbyme> yes I know, wanted to check if its actually working http://jsfiddle.net/BBLnE/
[11:07:57] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: I'm having an issue where if i declare a "class" in my dialog() function in IE 8 i get an error
[11:08:14] <NoiseEee> how are you declaring a 'class'
[11:08:31] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: class is a reserved word
[11:08:36] <jeffsmykil> in the documentation it sas to just do class: 'foo'
[11:08:38] <Eviltwin> So you can't do like "var class;"
[11:08:49] <NoiseEee> no, class is always in quotes.
[11:08:53] <Eviltwin> You may need to use "class": "foo"
[11:08:55] <NoiseEee> 'class':'fooo'
[11:09:39] <abjorn> imsky: #vidyadev is funny
[11:09:39] <abjorn> (1:09:14 PM) hexmasta: i hate my life
[11:09:39] <abjorn> (1:09:16 PM) hexmasta: why can't i be born as some starving kid in africa
[11:09:40] <jeffsmykil> ok
[11:09:41] <jeffsmykil> thankyou
[11:09:48] <imsky> lol
[11:10:13] <jeffsmykil> yup quotes worked
[11:10:14] <imsky> why does that bro hate his life
[11:10:18] <jeffsmykil> you guys are aweome
[11:10:33] <abjorn> #vidyadev with it's 50 people, 8 of which are not idle
[11:10:43] <photosbyme> ok it works, me getting using wrong class - long day
[11:11:22] <JAAulde> Simplified question: How do I get the data (via .data() ) from an element in window.opener ?
[11:11:37] <abjorn> btw imsky: http://www.osnews.com/story/25469/Richard_Stallman_Was_Right_All_Along
[11:11:42] <imsky> i saw
[11:11:50] <imsky> SOPA looks like it's gonna lose though
[11:11:57] <ajpiano> JAAulde: JAAulde window.opener.jQuery("#foo").data() ??
[11:12:52] <JAAulde> ajpiano: well, the only thing I have is a reference to the element. I tried using `window.opener.$( eleRef ).data( 'foo' )` but it still came back undefined
[11:12:56] <abjorn> I wouldn't be surprised if it goes either way, but after seeing the cory doctorow talk they mentioned in there im kinda not as worried about sopa anymore
[11:13:20] <ajpiano> JAAulde: :/ i donno really, that was just a guess
[11:13:31] <JAAulde> ajpiano: ok, I'll keep poking
[11:14:14] <JAAulde> Unfortunately this is all tied to a tinymce thing which is getting borked when the tinyMCE fullscreen popup window is involved.
[11:17:08] <diamonds> what sort of selector is this? '#jqLogin[rel]'
[11:17:24] <diamonds> does it select that ID if it has a rel attribute or what?
[11:17:29] <jedimind> correct
[11:17:30] <Michael> yes
[11:17:33] <diamonds> ok
[11:17:54] <diamonds> yeah well it's confusing because why is someone selecting by ID and further filtering...
[11:18:14] <jedimind> probably not for a good reason
[11:18:21] <diamonds> jedimindâ˜ƒ I think you are correct
[11:18:33] <jedimind> but there could be a case scenario where depending on a current state of something it gets a rel
[11:23:40] <nlweb> Having trouble with the autocomplete widget. Similar code worked in other project, cant figure out what I am missing / what is wrong. http://jsfiddle.net/TYPfw/ PHP file returns correct JSON
[11:26:47] <JAAulde> ajpiano: i guess something else is going wrong because window.opener.$ is working in a test context
[11:32:10] <abjorn> imsky: gimme sumthin good to watch on netflix, ive run dry :(
[11:32:38] <imsky> abjorn: boiler room
[11:34:26] <abjorn> well i was thinking more along the lines of a tv series
[11:35:12] <imsky> trailer park boys
[11:36:08] <abjorn> werd
[11:36:34] <abjorn> will be a nice change of pace from shitty animes
[11:36:55] <jeffsmykil> should event.target.className work in IE?
[11:37:40] <imsky> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533560%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
[11:38:49] <jeffsmykil> so just use object.classname?
[11:39:07] <Michael> ? ajax
[11:39:07] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[11:39:50] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: var el = $(event.target);  el.addClass('whateves');
[11:40:05] <jeffsmykil> not trying to add class
[11:40:12] <NoiseEee> so what exactly are you trying to do
[11:40:13] <jeffsmykil> using it for an if statement
[11:40:34] <jeffsmykil> so i need the class name of the event target
[11:40:55] <jeffsmykil> so 		if (event.target.className == "buttonLeftOrangeHover") {
[11:41:18] <NoiseEee> if(el.hasClass('buttonLeftOrangeHover')) { //something }
[11:41:42] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee: the code I have now works in Firefox and safari, but not IE
[11:41:49] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: thats why people use jquery.
[11:41:51] <NoiseEee> so use it.
[11:41:55] <NoiseEee> since you're in #jquery and all
[11:43:11] <jeffsmykil> ill try with hasClass
[11:43:12] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[11:43:13] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: <div class='peanutbutter chocolate'>Reeses</div>      pretty sure el.className there is "peanutbutter chocolate", not either or
[11:43:29] <NoiseEee> good luck
[11:46:06] <jeffsmykil> ill need it
[11:46:08] <jeffsmykil> this is ie
[11:49:09] <julesmiller> hey there. i'm new and not sure how exactly to get help with my problem. i need to make a jquery carousel stop scrolling through the thumbnails
[11:49:45] <hazamonzo> Hey folks. I want to add a caption like functionaility to blueprint css divs. I've seen a load of caption jquery libs that add captions to images but they don't work so well with blueprint divs. Is there another name for this kind of thing instead of caption? Something i can google?
[11:49:57] <pifantastic> julesmiller: the best thing to do is reproduce your problem on jsfiddle.net
[11:50:00] <elux> hey guys
[11:50:02] <pifantastic> and then we can help you tweak the code
[11:50:13] <julesmiller> perfect. i'll do that now! brb
[11:50:25] <elux> id like to do an ajax call where I can get back headers too..? any suggestions?
[11:50:33] <silverwind> Anyone knows a file upload plugin that doesn't suck? :(
[11:50:43] <elux> i guess $.getJSON() cant do this for me?
[11:52:23] <pifantastic> elux: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1557602/jquery-and-ajax-response-header
[11:53:34] <Michael> ? toggle
[11:53:34] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[11:55:24] <pifantastic> elux: http://jsfiddle.net/2zSNp/
[11:56:53] <julesmiller> ok i created a jsfiddle of my problem it's not advancing the carousel at all in the fiddle though. http://jsfiddle.net/julianmiller/TWFad/1/
[11:57:26] <y3di> how do you bind a click to dom elements that get dynamically created?
[11:57:48] <Mark-> Does anyone know if there is a way to still access the data in the toggle method. I noticed it was changed in 1.7: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9933
[11:58:11] <Brodingo> julesmiller check the console theres an error at line 368
[11:58:21] <NoiseEee> y3di: in general, the best way is to use event delegation.  have a common parent listen for clicks, and then query the event and see if it happened on an element you care about, and do the appropriate action.  takes away the need for adding/removing listeners on dynamically created/removed elements.
[11:58:24] <julesmiller> will do brodingo
[11:59:13] <y3di> heh, interesting method. hadn't thought of that, thanks NoiseEee
[11:59:33] <NoiseEee> np
[12:00:56] <julesmiller> hmm i'm unable to find the error
[12:01:26] <Brodingo> you misspelled animate
[12:01:39] <zCoder> Any experianced developers need a job? PM me :)
[12:01:54] <julesmiller> thanks!
[12:02:59] <basalt79> hi all, if i have a .find("member").each(function()  on a xml, and the function should add a value of the xml to a string defined outside the function the string will not be filled
[12:03:10] <julesmiller> updated and now the error is evident. notice how the carousel advances once it hits the 3rd thumbnail? I want it to stay exactly as it does on the first and second for all of them
[12:03:14] <basalt79> but the string will be append if i debug this code
[12:11:40] <jeffsmykil> anyone know how to clear the console in IE?
[12:11:56] <Brodingo> right click in it
[12:12:09] <jeffsmykil> ah thought there was a command
[12:12:10] <jeffsmykil> ty
[12:12:16] <Brodingo> maybe
[12:12:25] <jeffsmykil> this works
[12:12:26] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[12:12:38] <Pilate> there is console.clear()
[12:12:44] <jeffsmykil> ah
[12:13:36] <basalt79> why is a jquery find().each() ONLY called in debug modus, or if  I alert a message BEFORE the query ?
[12:14:44] <photosbyme> not quite there, i cannot remove the class after : http://jsfiddle.net/BBLnE/1/
[12:15:09] <obfuscatr> anyone know of a 'quick' way to do a bottom toolbar, with jquery (or just css..). needs to be cross browser compatible and simple CSS doesn't seem to work nice with IE.
[12:15:40] <jeffsmykil> obfuscatr: good luck with that
[12:15:41] <Eviltwin> You mean like position: fixed?
[12:15:44] <jeffsmykil> i did it once
[12:15:49] <jeffsmykil> pita
[12:15:54] <albertosh> Is there a way to find elements by an attribute????
[12:15:59] <Eviltwin> basalt79: Can you explain further
[12:16:04] <albertosh> sorry for the ??? :S
[12:16:06] <Eviltwin> albertosh: Many
[12:16:07] <jeffsmykil> especially with liquid layout
[12:16:27] <zCoder> Any front end pros that do freelance?'
[12:16:29] <Eviltwin> albertosh: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[12:16:42] <imsky> zCoder: sure do, what's up?
[12:16:44] <albertosh> Thanks Eviltwin!
[12:16:55] <basalt79> Eviltwin: define a variable contains all LI elements, than do a find().each() on xml object and add all elemnts to the li string var
[12:17:09] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: you are on fire today, are you not working?
[12:17:32] <obfuscatr> Eviltwin, yeah like position: fixed, but with IE support... :(
[12:17:59] <Eviltwin> Have you looked at http://tagsoup.com/cookbook/css/fixed/ ?
[12:18:42] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: I'm in and out as I'm waiting for stuff to load for work
[12:18:57] <Eviltwin> I call myself a "compulsive multitasker"
[12:19:09] <jeffsmykil> so your code is "compiling"
[12:19:42] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ basalt79
[12:19:43] <bot-t> basalt79, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[12:19:58] <jeffsmykil> they have been buying us all these toys for the break room here, but we are all afraid to use them
[12:20:05] <jeffsmykil> "It's a trap!"
[12:20:32] <obfuscatr> Eviltwin, you got me all excited then, unfortunately their fixed-bottom example doesn't work in IE9
[12:20:44] <Eviltwin> Compatability mode!
[12:21:09] <NoiseEee> does jquery have an equivalent to http://api.prototypejs.org/dom/Element/scrollTo/ or do i need to find offsets first?
[12:21:15] <jeffsmykil> why can't we all just agree on one broswer?
[12:21:24] <ajpiano> ?scrollTo @ NoiseEee
[12:21:26] <bot-t> NoiseEee, ScrollTo - Plugins - jQuery - With this plugin, you will easily scroll overflowed elements, and the screen itself. It gives you access to many different options to customize and various ways to specify where to scroll. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo
[12:21:44] <NoiseEee> thanks ajpiano
[12:22:58] <sphinxxx> jquery should have a page where you can bake in other plugins, and then download the minified script
[12:23:51] <jeffsmykil> and a pony
[12:23:57] <jeffsmykil> so i can play with it when i get bored at work
[12:24:58] <jeffsmykil> and a water slide
[12:30:23] <tfitts> jeffsmyki: one browser leaves us with internet explorer 5 due to no competition
[12:30:39] <basalt79> Eviltwin: sorry i found the problem, it was a timing problem from a ajax call
[12:32:00] <jeffsmykil> tfitts: before my webdev time
[12:32:09] <jeffsmykil> tfitts: but i vaguely remember the lawsuit
[12:32:37] <tfitts> I don't so much mean the specific version and lawsuit, just that when there is no competition, innovation tends to stop.
[12:37:13] <donCams> how do you get the id of the <html> tag of a page inside an <iframe>?
[12:38:39] <Eviltwin> $("iframe").contents().find("html")
[12:38:52] <imsky> oh jquery
[12:38:55] <donCams> Permission denied to access property 'ownerDocument
[12:39:05] <Eviltwin> I think you've violating SOP then
[12:39:11] <donCams> oh right
[12:39:23] <donCams> crap :( i guess i'll do some php sniffing :3
[12:45:48] <jeffsmykil> anyone having artifacting issues with border radius in IE 9?
[12:46:03] <techouse> umm, no
[12:46:07] <techouse> at least not me
[12:46:16] <jeffsmykil> i am with the modal dialog corners
[12:46:59] <panzi> I don't undestand how animation queues work. I thought you can use them to separate multiple animations of one element so you can stop only one, but it does not work for me
[12:47:40] <panzi> I tried to make a scrolling text in an div that can be resized. and when the div is big enough it stops scrolling: http://jsfiddle.net/g5HRF/
[12:47:45] <Eviltwin> panzi: Animation queues are used to prevent two separate animations on the same element from happening at once
[12:48:00] <panzi> but it does not do anything at all!
[12:48:32] <panzi> so how may I do what I want?
[12:48:38] <techouse> jeffsmykil: btw, ditch ie support
[12:48:46] <techouse> the sooner we do it the sooner ie10 will come
[12:48:47] <jeffsmykil> techouse:  can't
[12:49:10] <techouse> what do you mean can't :P then make a separate css for ie without border-radius
[12:49:16] <techouse> or use css3 pie
[12:49:59] <jeffsmykil> if you do client work for stallworth companies
[12:50:01] <jeffsmykil> IE is a must
[12:50:03] <techouse> but beware of those paths with PIE.htc :/ they have to be relative to the html file
[12:50:14] <jeffsmykil> techouse: https://skitch.com/jsmykil/gi2p8/windows-7-x64
[12:50:20] <jeffsmykil> thats what im talking about btw
[12:50:25] <techouse> well... then http://css3pie.com/
[12:50:47] <jeffsmykil> i have not used it
[12:50:48] <panzi> Eviltwin: so how do I control two independent animations on one and the same element?
[12:50:57] <techouse> jeffsmykil: never seen that
[12:51:10] <techouse> u sure your browser ain't doped?
[12:51:22] <techouse> or that some other js is interfering?
[12:51:34] <jeffsmykil> techouse: at least one other person is having the same issue
[12:51:35] <jeffsmykil> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7840631/ie9-rendering-elements-with-opacity-border-radius-or-cufon
[12:52:17] <techouse> jeffsmykil: as is said, force ie9 to use css3 pie
[12:53:01] <techouse> i managed ie7 to make border-radius with it
[12:53:04] <jeffsmykil> its white when im over the dialog
[12:53:08] <jeffsmykil> black when im not
[12:53:29] <techouse> you mean the corners?
[12:53:34] <Eviltwin> panzi: I believe "fx" is the only queue that conrols animations
[12:53:38] <jeffsmykil> that black dash
[12:53:44] <techouse> ah
[12:53:45] <techouse> hmm
[12:53:47] <jeffsmykil> techouse: that black dash
[12:54:24] <techouse> jeffsmykil: try and use css3 pie and then report back
[12:54:34] <techouse> it might fix it or it might not
[12:54:43] <techouse> if it doesn't well...screw it
[12:54:57] <jeffsmykil> id rather figure out why its happeneing
[12:55:06] <Eviltwin> panzi: Correction: "fx" is the only queue that automatically dequeues
[12:55:16] <Eviltwin> panzi: You need to add a .dequeue("resize") to the end to start the animations
[12:55:23] <techouse> why? lol :D go ask ms why it doesn't support any advanced css3 :P
[12:55:36] <techouse> they just don't give a flying f**k
[12:56:36] <techouse> jeffsmykil: worst case scenario you can use png images
[12:56:46] <jeffsmykil> huh its somewhat visible in Firefox
[12:56:58] <techouse> then it's some js collision
[12:57:03] <jeffsmykil> techouse: yeah the modal dialog structure would be a nightmare to use pngs on
[12:57:05] <techouse> disable one js library after the other
[12:57:21] <techouse> no s***t sherlock :D
[12:57:50] <jeffsmykil> I like my idea
[12:57:57] <jeffsmykil> ignore it and hope the client doesnt notice
[12:58:02] <techouse> lol :D
[12:58:06] <techouse> not a solution :D
[12:58:18] <jeffsmykil> i disagree
[12:58:31] <techouse> but you could do a nasty trick :D set the backgroud to the colour of your button
[12:58:37] <techouse> so even if it's transparent
[12:58:54] <techouse> it ain't visible
[13:03:24] <jeffsmykil> i need to change the text just in firefox lol
[13:03:31] <jeffsmykil> conditional firefox styles?
[13:05:29] <jeffsmykil> oh nice not a bug a "feature" you cant set linehight on buttons in FF

[13:09:47] <sphinxxx> how can i force the cursor to be at the very beginning of a textarea, when the textarea goes in focus
[13:11:30] <Eviltwin> sphinxxx: There are a number of Stack Overflows
[13:11:51] <Eviltwin> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/499126/jquery-set-cursor-position-in-text-area http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6960445/find-position-of-cursor-in-textarea http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3286595/update-textarea-value-but-keep-cursor-position
[13:19:42] <sphinxxx> eviltwin i've tried a couple of those and can't get it to move the cursor
[13:21:03] <matjas> domCams: check out $('iframe').contents()
[13:22:28] <sphinxxx> .contents() will only work if the iframe is from the same domain
[13:23:24] <Kzim> hi when i do that:  $("#results").append('<div class="sortable">'); i have that: <div class="sortable"></div> but i don't want close this div :( i don't understand
[13:24:40] <NoiseEee> Kzim: what are you trying to do?
[13:24:57] <NoiseEee> you're appending an element.... an element is an element, not a half-element ;)
[13:25:37] <Eviltwin> Kzim: JavaScript doesn't work in HTML
[13:25:45] <pifantastic> Kzim: you can either build up your string of HTML and add it all at once using $('#results').append(stringOfHtml) or you can use templates
[13:25:49] <Eviltwin> It works in elements
[13:25:53] <Eviltwin> Well, nodes
[13:25:54] <Eviltwin> Of a tree
[13:25:59] <NoiseEee> a tree of life
[13:26:08] <sphinxxx> and death
[13:27:20] <t4nkd> Hey jQ, is there a function that's a little more human-friendly than formatDate for converting a date object into 'mm-dd-yy 12-hour-local-time'
[13:27:44] <t4nkd> Particularly with the local time aspect
[13:29:40] <pifantastic> t4nkd: where are you geting "formatDate" from?
[13:29:45] <t4nkd> jquery ui
[13:30:06] <pifantastic> t4nkd: moment.js has a pretty nice API http://momentjs.com/
[13:30:15] <PhonicUK> I think I am a bit nuts
[13:30:38] <PhonicUK> I've been implementing things like where, orderBy, etc for Javascript arrays
[13:30:41] <PhonicUK> so I can do things like:
[13:30:47] <PhonicUK> data.where(function(e){return(e.Age > 14);}).orderBy('FirstName').first();
[13:31:08] <pifantastic> PhonicUK: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
[13:31:26] <t4nkd> Hrm, I was hoping something was baked in to a different part of jquery per chance, like, toString from a date object does some fancy stuff maybe
[13:31:43] <pifantastic> ?eval (new Date).toString()
[13:31:47] <xckpd7> can I ask an implementation question? I want to give form elements on a page the ability to pass key/value pairs when they are submitted... what would be the best format to tie this to a form? for instance if I wanted a form to automatically pass the key/value pair: "itemid": 246
[13:31:48] <bot-t> pifantastic: "Wed Jan 04 2012 03:01:42 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)"
[13:32:02] <pifantastic> that's about all you'll get out of core Javascript
[13:32:11] <Kzim> pifantastic: my probleme is i do need to interact with those div while they are displayed
[13:32:14] <t4nkd> drat, close but deff need to manipulate that timestamp
[13:32:46] <pifantastic> xckpd7: <input type="hidden" name="itemid" value="246" />
[13:32:51] <Kzim> pifantastic: i can't open a div make things in javascript then close it ?
[13:33:08] <pifantastic> ?xy @ Kzim
[13:33:09] <bot-t> Kzim, You're trying to do X, and you thought of solution Y. So you're asking about solution Y, without even mentioning X. The problem is, there might be a better solution, but we can't know that unless you describe what X is. http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=542341
[13:33:55] <pifantastic> t4nkd: the javascript Date API is abysmal, I wouldn't expect it to do much for you. that's why things like moment.js exist
[13:34:20] <t4nkd> Ah well, unlucky but, it is what it is I suppose
[13:34:27] <xckpd7> pifantastic: it has to be on the form. Also, assume I need to use the name / value attributes for other things... I basically want something like data-xtrainfo="itemid_246"
[13:35:03] <xckpd7> though that specifically would be weird because I would have to sniff to check if the value needs to be quoted... I'm just looking for something a little more elegant
[13:35:23] <pifantastic> xckpd7: what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[13:35:27] <xckpd7> so basically I can run a test to see if the data type exists, and if so, grab the values.... instead of poring over name / value attributes
[13:35:34] <Kzim> pifantastic: i want build multiple select in jquery wich are all in a div created in jquery too. but i also need to access those select in jquery to force the .val() of those select. but since i don't append the built divs to the HTML i can't act on the select. well looks like it (sorry for my poor english)
[13:36:16] <pifantastic> Kzim: just a sec
[13:36:41] <xckpd7> pifantastic: I'm trying to write a generic post script for different forms on our site... some of the forms just need to submit the data in the inputs... fairly easy... but some forms need to have extra data submitted with it. I want a generic way to tell the script "hey this form is special and requires a little bit more data you need to submit"
[13:37:22] <xckpd7> currently we have 3 different scripts handling different forms but it doesn't need to be that way... catch the end use case and consolidate them
[13:38:14] <BillCriswell> I'm using the form_validation library. The documentation is great but does it insert the data for you automatically or do I still have to do that?
[13:38:21] <private_meta> Can someone tell me how to use wildcards in jquery selectors in the name i search for? like searching for ids with the name "part1*part2" where * is any, like *[id*=part1*part2]'?
[13:38:31] <xckpd7> I figured adding a data-type it could sniff, along with the relevant information would work.... but it's awkward
[13:38:54] <NoiseEee> private_meta: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[13:39:13] <Eviltwin> private_meta: And more generically: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[13:39:21] <pifantastic> Kzim: http://jsfiddle.net/PkyfL/
[13:39:58] <pifantastic> xckpd7: why can't you just add the relevant info in hidden form fields?
[13:40:04] <pifantastic> that's what they're for
[13:40:17] <private_meta> NoiseEee, Eviltwin: Well, I need to have it exactly "part1" with random text inbetween, then part2, I didn't see that in the selector apis
[13:40:31] <Kzim> pifantastic: damn i think i have to recode many things thx
[13:40:34] <Eviltwin> private_meta: That's because there's no selector for that
[13:40:37] <Eviltwin> What are you trying to do?
[13:40:56] <Eviltwin> Specifically
[13:41:00] <Eviltwin> What's the setup
[13:41:00] <private_meta> I want to capture "selectAll*Id" where * is random text
[13:41:05] <Eviltwin> Why?
[13:41:10] <private_meta> Because I need them
[13:41:13] <NoiseEee> private_meta: offhand it sounds like you'd be better off putting your 'part1' and 'part2' as classes, and finding by those
[13:41:21] <NoiseEee> private_meta: you're cramming irrelevant thigns into the ID
[13:41:41] <pifantastic> private_meta: give them all a class
[13:41:47] <pifantastic> and just use that
[13:42:33] <xckpd7> pifantastic: even though I've been doing work with HTML / CSS a long time, I've never really gotten to do too much with forms. The hidden inputs will work perfectly, I just wasn't thinking. Thanks
[13:43:18] <private_meta> I don't know it that well, I have to edit a page someone else made, so I'm a bit of a noob there, how do I add classes? I'm not sure how to use that properly in JSF/Richfaces
[13:44:05] <dabear> ?addclass @ private_meta
[13:44:06] <bot-t> private_meta, .addClass(className): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[13:44:26] <pifantastic> private_meta: whatever is generating the elements with these random IDs should also give them a common class
[13:44:53] <private_meta> dabear: If I use that I STILL have to have a selector capturing them all
[13:45:05] <private_meta> pifantastic: Well, no idea how
[13:45:25] <Che-Anarc> If I define a class >  .thslide_list div { }     & already have parent <div class="thslide_list">  how I refer to div therein?
[13:45:59] <pifantastic> private_meta: I believe in you
[13:46:06] <andrew9183> are there better ways to write this: http://jsfiddle.net/NyuCP/ ?
[13:46:08] <private_meta> pifantastic: yeah, thanks, that won't help
[13:46:15] <andrew9183> i find i do this code alot, and just wondering if theres a more elegant minty fresh way
[13:46:43] <pifantastic> private_meta: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/190253/jquery-selector-regular-expressions
[13:46:50] <pifantastic> it's gonna be slow though :/
[13:47:22] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: Use a comma
[13:47:40] <pifantastic> andrew9183: you dont need the .each()
[13:48:15] <Eviltwin> That too
[13:48:17] <pifantastic> andrew9183: http://jsfiddle.net/2m8z9/1/
[13:48:45] <BillCriswell> I was wondering why no one was helping me with my codeigniter question in here! Haha
[13:48:51] <private_meta> pifantastic: if I have a <div class...> and in there I have a input of checkbox type, I guess the selector only selects the div type, not the input I want itself?
[13:49:03] <jedimind> are there any known issues with fadein/out  and IE8 ?
[13:49:16] <private_meta> IE8 is a crackpot of issues
[13:49:27] <jedimind> thanks for that very useful information
[13:49:32] <andrew9183> ah, you're right.  thanks pifantastic
[13:49:35] <pifantastic> private_meta: $('.class input[type="checkbox"]')
[13:49:55] <andrew9183> thanks Eviltwin :D
[13:50:29] <Eviltwin> This should work too: http://jsfiddle.net/2m8z9/2/
[13:51:16] <pifantastic> Eviltwin: in that case just use toggleClass
[13:51:19] <pifantastic> ?toggleClass
[13:51:20] <bot-t> .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[13:51:23] <private_meta> Yeah... well, I think I'd rather work around my issue by renaming my ids so I can find them with one selector search
[13:51:29] <private_meta> that seems to be easier than the rest
[13:51:39] <Eviltwin> pifantastic: I think you mean .toggle()
[13:51:45] <NoiseEee> private_meta: its still the wrong approach, but whatever
[13:51:48] <pifantastic> Eviltwin: err, yeah
[13:51:58] <pifantastic> private_meta: understandable, but yeah, wrong approach
[13:52:08] <private_meta> pifantastic: less work
[13:52:21] <pifantastic> and I hope you dont have a large number of elements
[13:52:23] <private_meta> pifantastic: If I made a new page I'd probably say "ok, let's make it right'
[13:52:27] <pifantastic> or else it  could be very slow
[13:52:32] <private_meta> pifantastic: define large
[13:52:36] <NoiseEee> less work, for now.  rendering future improvements/additions difficult / more work
[13:52:47] <NoiseEee> and as pifantastic mentions, slower to boot
[13:52:58] <pifantastic> yeah, avoid piling on more and more technical debt
[13:53:21] <zosky> hi yall. help binding json data to a template please... this is the example im followin (http://goo.gl/ZFqSy ). this is my JSON.data: http://goo.gl/d66El and my HTML: http://pastebin.com/450q49Cz  .., would anyone please get it to parse the data feed properly with just 1 field, then i can start 'theme-ing '
[13:53:23] <Kzim> pifantastic: can i ask you if this is the way to do it http://pastie.org/3121044
[13:54:02] <natrixnatrix89> Hello.. I just finished an open source jquery plugin. I've put it on gitgub.. but I was hoping maybe you guys might know some places I could post a link to it.. so that people that might find it useful could find it..
[13:54:02] <natrixnatrix89> You know.. since the jquery plugins site is currently down..
[13:54:12] <private_meta> pifantastic: how does the class make it faster exactly? because it prefilters?
[13:54:16] <natrixnatrix89> here's the link.. http://natrixnatrix89.github.com/promptu-menu/
[13:54:38] <pifantastic> Kzim: this is one way to do it. But I would highly suggest using a templating library
[13:54:43] <pifantastic> like handlebars.js
[13:54:54] <pifantastic> or even the jquery template plugin
[13:55:51] <pifantastic> private_meta: your approach is going to have to grab every element that has an ID, and then in javascript, filter out the ones that dont match. Using a class will be able to use the browser's built in (and very fast) querySelectorAll or getElementsByClassName
[13:56:22] <Kzim> pifantastic: arg i'll try to find about that what is the best ? dandlebars or jquery template ?
[13:56:33] <private_meta> pifantastic: ok
[13:56:50] <pifantastic> Kzim: I prefer http://handlebarsjs.com/
[13:57:31] <Kzim> pifantastic: i use django wich have {{}} this must be a problem no ?
[13:58:27] <pifantastic> Ahh, yeah, that's a sticky situation Kzim http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7229484/handlebars-js-in-django-templates
[13:58:36] <aaronmcadam> Kzim: you could try underscore templates instead
[13:58:56] <aaronmcadam> or else there should be a way to use erb style tags instead, like u can do with underscore
[13:59:03] <private_meta> pifantastic: so, it would be $('.class input[type="checkbox"][id*="selectAll"]) to get all checkboxes that have an id with selectAll in it? How do I specify the class name there?
[13:59:45] <Kzim> aaronmcadam: i'll check that ty
[13:59:48] <aaronmcadam> it's pretty yucky
[14:00:02] <aaronmcadam> what's wrong with adding a class to the checkboxes?
[14:00:18] <pifantastic> private_meta: $('.class input.class)
[14:00:20] <t4nkd> I'm using map to filter down to what will always be a single object, is there a painless function to reduce [{obj}] down to just {obj} after .map() ?
[14:00:29] <aaronmcadam> Kzim: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#template
[14:00:33] <hazamonzo> Folks, i have a <div id="something"></div> and i want to add a new child div to this existing div... so i end up with something that looks like <div id="something"><div id="newChildDiv"></div></div> Suggestions?
[14:00:41] <pifantastic> private_meta: or $('.class input.classinput[type="checkbox"]')
[14:00:42] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: .get(0) ?
[14:00:51] <t4nkd> nice, yep that'd be what I want I believe
[14:00:55] <pifantastic> t4nkd: []
[14:01:04] <pifantastic> err
[14:01:08] <t4nkd> :0?
[14:01:11] <private_meta> pifantastic: I still don't see where you speficy class names
[14:01:13] <pifantastic> $('wahtever').map()[0]
[14:01:19] <t4nkd> oh true enuff
[14:01:24] <pifantastic> private_meta: replace "class" with your actual class
[14:01:38] <Kzim> aaronmcadam: look nice thx a lot
[14:01:43] <aaronmcadam> no worreis
[14:01:48] <aaronmcadam> I use django btw too
[14:01:49] <private_meta> pifantastic: for both uses of 'class'?
[14:02:14] <aaronmcadam> I've not switched to using {{ }} as delimiters, I just use <% %>
[14:02:16] <pifantastic> hazamonzo: $('<div id="something"></div>').append('<div id="newChildDiv"></div>');

[14:14:58] <natrixnatrix89> yes. I know what happened
[14:15:09] <aaronmcadam> do your plugins have unit tests?
[14:15:12] <natrixnatrix89> a little failure with db query
[14:15:19] <natrixnatrix89> unit tests?
[14:15:23] <natrixnatrix89> what are those?

[14:21:38] <bot-t> Kzim, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[14:21:51] <private_meta> so, can someone tell me how to test jquery expressions on an existing page?
[14:21:59] <private_meta> I mean selectors
[14:22:18] <NoiseEee> private_meta: open up your console (ie: firebug) and go to work, so to speak
[14:22:57] <NoiseEee> just type $(<my selector>) and see if you get the results intended
[14:23:27] <aaronmcadam> or Firefinder
[14:23:34] <aaronmcadam> which I never actually use heh
[14:24:08] <private_meta> NoiseEee: ah, apparently I need to type jQuery(...)
[14:28:28] <private_meta> ok, noob territory, how do I access a specific result element if there is more than one?
[14:28:39] <jedimind> whats a result element?
[14:28:56] <pifantastic> private_meta: jquery objects are also arrays, so $('p')[3]
[14:29:12] <pifantastic> private_meta: there is also an each() function for iterating
[14:29:16] <pifantastic> ?each
[14:29:17] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[14:29:31] <private_meta> pifantastic: I know about each, but I want to have a single one for testing
[14:29:44] <private_meta> and the array access [] doesn't give me any of the elements
[14:30:09] <pifantastic> private_meta: make sure there are elements, you can do that with .length or size()
[14:30:36] <z0ned> anyone have any examples/tutorials for using jquery and json responses (not xml) with google maps api v3 (not v2) for a store locator?
[14:31:53] <private_meta> pifantastic: typing $(..) gives me two entries, typing $(..).size gives me nothing (just 'function()' in firebug console)
[14:33:19] <pifantastic> $('foo').size() or $('foo').length
[14:33:29] <private_meta> ah ok
[14:33:35] <pifantastic> and if it has two entries, $('foo')[0] and $('foo')[1]
[14:33:41] <private_meta> pifantastic: yes, getting "2" as size()
[14:34:02] <private_meta> pifantastic: somehow works now
[14:34:25] <pifantastic> The console is a great way to get familiar with jQuery
[14:38:41] <private_meta> pifantastic: each takes index and Element, so doesn't [] on jQuery also give me an Element?
[14:39:09] <private_meta> 'cause in a "each" I already use I use 'attr', just thought I can't use that on a [] from the jquery result
[14:39:14] <Eviltwin> each doesn't take an index and an element
[14:39:17] <Eviltwin> The callback does
[14:39:26] <Eviltwin> So that it has that information
[14:39:41] <Eviltwin> each takes a callback
[14:39:57] <private_meta> Eviltwin: ok. Still, what is the result of [] if not an element?
[14:40:12] <Eviltwin> What is the result of []?
[14:40:16] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure I understand
[14:40:20] <Eviltwin> [] the operator?
[14:40:36] <private_meta> yes
[14:40:37] <Eviltwin> Or [] the JSON notation for instantiating an empty array
[14:40:42] <pifantastic> private_meta: [] will return an Element
[14:40:42] <gnarf> private_meta: a jQuery object is an array of elements
[14:40:43] <private_meta> $(.....)[]
[14:40:51] <Eviltwin> It will be an element (or undefined)
[14:41:01] <Eviltwin> Assuming you're passing in an integer
[14:41:03] <private_meta> So, it's the same I get in the each callback interface at the name "Element"
[14:41:05] <gnarf> with the jQuery.fn prototype
[14:41:27] <private_meta> so, I should be able to call $('class')[0].attr('attrname')
[14:41:33] <gnarf> private_meta: nope
[14:41:36] <Eviltwin> You could do var a = $("label"); for(var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) { a[i]; }
[14:41:42] <gnarf> elements won't have jQuery prototypes
[14:41:43] <Eviltwin> Elements don't have .attr
[14:41:45] <private_meta> But I do it in the each function callback
[14:41:48] <Eviltwin> Elements are elements
[14:41:58] <gnarf> $("class").eq(0).attr('attrname') will work
[14:42:17] <Eviltwin> They have things like appendChild, parentNode, nextSibling, insertBefore etc
[14:42:18] <pifantastic> eq() returns a jquery object whereas [] returns the actual Dom Element
[14:42:26] <private_meta> ah ok
[14:42:32] <Eviltwin> jQuery collections have things like append, parent, next, and before
[14:42:34] <private_meta> thanks, what I wanted works with .eq
[14:42:39] <pifantastic> and each() will set the context of the callback, "this" equal to the current DOM element
[14:42:40] <Eviltwin> Yup
[14:43:00] <jbdemonte> while this works : http://jsfiddle.net/Pq6HC/22/ while this doesnt : http://jsfiddle.net/Pq6HC/21/ ?
[14:44:47] <pifantastic> jbdemonte: notice the way jQuery is being loaded
[14:45:07] <pifantastic> onLoad vs. no wrap (head)
[14:46:06] <jbdemonte> @pifantastic : GG :)
[14:48:50] <jbdemonte> In my code, when i animate top, left and transform, on IE, only transform works while on jsfiddle, this is only left and top : http://jsfiddle.net/Pq6HC/24/
[14:49:00] <jbdemonte> on firefox, all works fine :/
[14:49:12] <Kzim> aaronmcadam: tempalte work great but is thre something to be more sexy than all in one linelike this ? http://pastie.org/3121332
[14:51:04] <pifantastic> Kzim: you can put your template in a <script type="text/x-underscore-template> tag
[14:51:13] <pifantastic> and then load it with jQuery
[14:51:20] <pifantastic> as a string
[14:51:24] <pifantastic> using .html()
[14:53:18] <pifantastic> Kzim: likeso my-template
[14:53:21] <pifantastic> whoops
[14:53:26] <pifantastic> http://jsfiddle.net/rRKpx/
[14:53:49] <Kzim> pifantastic: very nice !
[14:53:51] <Kzim> thx a lot
[15:19:08] <talntid> Anyone for hire want to develop a jquery plugin for me? It's a menu system, where you wrap the menu items around a cylinder, and rotate them based on 2 buttons... then when the desired menu item is in front, you click it, and it will open the page. If so, PM me :)
[15:25:09] <someprimetime> is it possible to record how long someone has been pressing a specific key? like use time() bound to the keyDown method?
[15:25:19] <someprimetime> keydown*  rather
[15:36:43] <pifantastic> someprimetime: I suppose something like this works: http://jsfiddle.net/Cydet/1/ although I bet there is a library out there that handles this
[15:36:55] <sphinxxx> is it possible to place a span inside a textarea?
[15:37:09] <someprimetime> pifantastic: did you just make that?
[15:37:14] <someprimetime> thanks bud excellent example
[15:37:30] <pifantastic> sphinxxx: http://jsfiddle.net/tSaw3/
[15:41:09] <Giverny> ajpiano awesome article in smashing magazine thank u
[15:43:39] <zarf> tmmrrhw: thanks a million
[15:43:58] <zarf> no further questions for now
[15:58:31] <aghouseh> is there some sort of bug with addClass?
[15:59:04] <aghouseh> thats a vague question.. im trying to add a class explicitly to an object which i can console.log and it just does not take it
[15:59:15] <aghouseh> it takes the .attr() that im stringing it into, but nothing
[16:01:21] <tmmrrhw> zarf NP. Glad I got you into jQuery, it'll be worth it in the long run.
[16:14:29] <shadykhan> i have an interview next week for a front end dev position i asked the lady if i should bring anything she ignored it completly and told me the location of the place to meet up at
[16:14:51] <shadykhan> so should i bring anything?
[16:15:26] <Eviltwin> Just be ready for questions about your resume and ready to show any work that's public
[16:15:38] <Eviltwin> And for questions about your qualifications for the position
[16:15:53] <Eviltwin> i.e. go through each bulletpoint for the position
[16:16:11] <shadykhan> alright thx again evil
[16:20:33] <z0ned> for...in  vs $.each ... differences? benefits?
[16:23:32] <Dave_Stein> if i do $('.items:visible') and i have CSS that says .dontshow .items { display: none }, vs .items.hide { display: none } is sizzle going to figure out it's hidden in one/both cases, or is it going to check width/height
[16:23:44] <Dave_Stein> *is sizzle going to figure it out or is jquery going to check width/height
[16:23:46] <pifantastic> z0ned: go with whatever you feel makes sense.
[16:24:13] <Dave_Stein> or do both check width/height anyway?
[16:24:15] <pifantastic> z0ned: they are almost the same under the hood, one just lets you execute a callback for each element
[16:24:43] <pifantastic> ?tias Dave_Stein
[16:24:44] <bot-t> pifantastic, Couldn't find "tias Dave_Stein" in jQuery Docs.
[16:24:50] <pifantastic> ?tias @ Dave_Stein
[16:24:51] <bot-t> Dave_Stein, Try It And See
[16:25:25] <Dave_Stein> pifantastic: i cant try it and know what its doing internally without looking at code, which im about do do, but was curious if anyonw knew offhand
[16:26:31] <pifantastic> Dave_Stein: there are some notes at http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[16:27:09] <Dave_Stein> 		return ( width === 0 && height === 0 ) || (!jQuery.support.reliableHiddenOffsets && ((elem.style && elem.style.display) || jQuery.css( elem, "display" )) === "none");
[16:27:33] <pifantastic> yeah, looks like :visible isn't a part of Sizzle at all
[16:27:44] <Dave_Stein> pifantastic: that api tells me what i knew, but see that line is how it figures it out so now im gonna see how css figures display, which i believ needs to check width/height in some browsers
[16:27:52] <Dave_Stein> if its not explicitly set in the style attribute
[16:28:03] <Dave_Stein> im gonna go double check .css function which is where sizzle would come in
[16:32:12] <mightym> hey everybody, I'm new to js/jquery . i have a server returning me an url like /?loginerror when i post the wrong user data to a form. is there a way to catch this, stop the page reload and use it to alert via javascript the error?
[16:33:37] <Dave_Stein> pifantastic: it forks into two functions and looks at elem.style or elem.currentStyle and I get a bit lost at that point
[16:34:09] <admin_> hi!
[16:34:21] <admin_> does any one use this plugin?
[16:34:26] <pifantastic> ?submit @ mightym
[16:34:27] <bot-t1> mightym, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[16:34:36] <admin_> http://datatables.net/
[16:34:40] <admin_> ?
[16:37:57] <z0ned> != undefined  vs   !== undefined
[16:39:51] <mightym> pifantastic: yes is read about submit, but as far as i understood this is more for checking sty on submit, in my case as far as i understood i posted data to the server and its redirecting me to a new url with a get param., but id like to catch this before the redirect happens, and display the user an error message without page reload
[16:44:24] <aagii> hi guys

[17:29:32] <private_meta> OK, Internet Explorer 8, you are appalling
[17:30:04] <Vaerros> hm?
[17:31:04] <private_meta> using JSF/RichFaces with IE8 doesn't seem to allow onchange-script calls through input-tags (checkbox types)
[17:31:23] <private_meta> It takes me HOURS to get some functionality working properly
[17:31:28] <private_meta> on ever current browser
[17:31:37] <private_meta> but NOOOO the simplest stuff does not work on IE
[17:32:32] <carpii> welcome the my world
[17:32:37] <carpii> to
[17:32:59] <private_meta> This sucks so much
[17:43:21] <someprimetime> what's the method for the first down click of a mouse?
[17:43:40] <someprimetime> nm mousedown :o
[17:44:40] <someprimetime> how would i bind multiple methods to the same function? like for click(), keydown(), mousedown()?
[17:45:36] <pifantastic> ?on @ someprimetime
[17:45:36] <bot-t> someprimetime, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:45:54] <someprimetime> pifantastic: nice thanks
[17:46:20] <pifantastic> someprimetime: $('body').on('click mousedown mouseup yourmother', function() { ... });
[17:46:34] <someprimetime> ooh mousing up my mother? sounds interesting
[17:46:51] <someprimetime> that's a lovely sequence
[17:46:58] <someprimetime> and thanks, this is exactly what i need
[17:47:09] <someprimetime> i always thought on() was just the new way to bind events
[17:47:14] <someprimetime> but i guess it has more than one purpose
[17:48:19] <private_meta> ok, might it be possible that the checkbox type input in IE doesn't accept "onchange"?
[17:48:22] <private_meta> erm
[17:48:25] <private_meta> ok, might it be possible that the checkbox type input in IE8 doesn't accept "onchange"?
[17:48:31] <aljosa> any idea what can cause "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'toJSON' of undefined" with jquery-1.6.4.js, line1488?
[17:48:39] <someprimetime> shit on() is only compatible with 1.7?
[17:48:43] <someprimetime> :{
[17:49:48] <someprimetime> could upgrading from 1.5 -> 1.7 possibly break any current code?
[17:51:20] <carpii> yep, it could
[17:51:28] <someprimetime> scoping the change log right now, i guess it depends if we're using any plugins
[17:51:45] <carpii> regardless of what the theory is, I've always had some sort of breakage when upgrading jquery
[17:53:59] <oxez> Hello. If I have this markup: [[ <em id="a">Hi</em> some <em id="b">#text</em> <em id="c">is</em> <em id="d">#her</em> e <em id="e"> boom</em> ]]. What I'm trying to achieve is to add a special class to all the <em> elements that are direct siblings to the ones whose first character is '#' with no text separating them (as well as the <em> having # as first char). So in my case I would like to
[17:54:05] <oxez> get #b, #c and #d. Any pointers on how I would achieve that?
[17:57:12] <Eviltwin> So there can't be text between them?
[17:57:21] <xp_prg> hi all I have a slider with an id: price_slider, I want to get its current value, so far I am trying this in the firebug js console: console.log($("#price_slider"));
[17:57:23] <Eviltwin> 'Cause you showed spaces
[17:57:32] <xp_prg> it shows lots of things
[17:58:43] <yan_nick> hey guys, i've a string "5 participants" how can i get the number? note: can also be 14 or 1000
[18:00:04] <xp_prg> hmm... this kind of works: console.log($("#price_slider").slider('value'));
[18:00:10] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: Is it always digits followed by at least one space?
[18:00:20] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: yes
[18:00:35] <Eviltwin> yan_nick: parseInt(str.split(' ')[0])
[18:01:33] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: cool thx
[18:01:42] <oxez> Eviltwin: hm good point, I'll see if there are actual spaces
[18:02:30] <xp_prg> it doesn't show the current value though
[18:10:39] <xp_prg> figured it out
[18:13:46] <yan_nick> Eviltwin: and when my string looks like <div class="participant-count clearfix">5 participants &nbsp; <a href="â€¦">Who is coming?</a></div> ?
[18:15:08] <oxez> Eviltwin: Sorry, yeah there is no space between the <em> elements
[18:15:29] <yan_nick> i repeat my question: how can i get the "5" here? <div class="participant-count clearfix">5 participants &nbsp; <a href="â€¦">Who is coming?</a></div>
[18:16:34] <carpii> theres various ways, as always
[18:16:44] <carpii> but depends on all the edge cases you want to handle
[18:16:59] <wtfizzle> easiest way would probably be parseInt( $('.participant-count').html() )
[18:18:42] <yan_nick> carpii: wtfizzle but this doesn't work or?
[18:19:07] <carpii> no idea, you tell us :)
[18:19:26] <carpii> or rather tell us why it doesn't work, if it doesnt
[18:20:16] <wtfizzle> http://jsfiddle.net/YHSCZ/
[18:20:24] <wtfizzle> Just made a jsfiddle example where it alerts the number
[18:20:33] <wtfizzle> I used .text() instead of .html() in that example, but both work
[18:21:17] <wtfizzle> If there's some case where that doesn't work, feel free to update the jsfiddle and send a new link
[18:21:21] <yan_nick> wtfizzle: and how would you change the $count later?
[18:21:39] <wtfizzle> Change the selector?
[18:22:01] <yan_nick> wtfizzle: nono, the text
[18:22:15] <yan_nick> wtfizzle: because you get the .text() so the "who is coming" cannot be update
[18:22:17] <wtfizzle> Ah, as long as the number is the first thing in there, you should be fine
[18:22:38] <carpii> personally id just wrap it in a span and access it that way
[18:22:44] <wtfizzle> Yea, that'd be ideal
[18:22:53] <wtfizzle> Or add it as a data element so you don't have to parse a string at all
[18:22:55] <yan_nick> wtfizzle: yes but i think i cannot change that, i try it
[18:22:57] <yan_nick> but thanks!
[18:23:25] <wtfizzle> Like I said, this should work fine as long as the structure is a number followed by strings
[18:24:02] <wtfizzle> You could also use .replace( /\D/g, '' ) to remove all non-numbers
[18:25:34] <Eviltwin> But then "16 people with 25.7% success" becomes "16257"
[18:25:40] <wtfizzle> Yea, that's true
[18:25:45] <wtfizzle> Remove the /g if you want only the first number
[18:26:14] <wtfizzle> Assuming it's always going to be an intâ€¦ if you expect numbers over 1,000 to be comma-separated, you'll want to add handling for that as well
[18:26:36] <wtfizzle> It all depends on what you expect the structure to be
[18:27:00] <wtfizzle> Errrrr, scratch that about removing /g, you'd have to do a bit more, lol
[18:27:10] <wtfizzle> Forgot I was using replace to remove stuff rather than getting a list of matches
[18:28:06] <wtfizzle> parseInt would still work fine in that case, though
[18:33:00] <DofLeFou> What am I doing whong here http://jsfiddle.net/ZwzK5/

[18:39:46] <DofLeFou> http://jsfiddle.net/ZwzK5/ why is my on click action not firing
[18:43:20] <DofLeFou> viadikoff: i meant to type ul
[18:52:29] <Vaerros> DofLeFou: why are you using onclick?
[18:53:35] <carpii> DofLeFou, your fiddler paste still shows u1 though

[19:07:03] <dnsdds> I'm opening a new window (or tab, as it happens) and I don't want an URL but custom content; is there a jQuery way to get the html() contents of an element to be displayed on a page on their own?
[19:10:24] <carpii> why open it in a tab?
[19:21:39] <dnsdds> carpii: Why not?
[19:22:11] <dnsdds> I'm doing a "print the contents of this div" button
[19:22:50] <dnsdds> I thought the easiest way would be to open the div html() in a new window/tab and open up the browser's own print dialog
[19:22:54] <Fritz_> hello,using jquery, if i have this string "foo100", how do I pull out the 100 and cast it to an int?
[19:23:19] <Fritz_> newmie banging my head against the wall
[19:23:27] <Fritz_> :/
[19:25:17] <carpii> this isn't really a query question, its about javascript string manipulation
[19:25:21] <carpii> jquery question
[19:25:47] <carpii> dnsdds, I'm not saying you shouldn't, i was asking why.
[19:26:28] <carpii> you could probably use document.write to repopulate the tab as if its a new frame or something, i don't know
[19:26:29] <dnsdds> carpii: Eh sorry, programming IRC channels have made me cynical.
[19:26:32] <carpii> seems a bit of a sucky design tho
[19:26:42] <carpii> heh
[19:27:03] <carpii> esp as most browsers will now block it and require the user to click the toolbar warning thing
[19:27:47] <Chibby_> dnsdds: slice(start, [end]) Returns a substring of the string based on the "start" and "end" index arguments, NOT including the "end" index itself. "End" is optional, and if none is specified, the slice includes all characters from "start" to end of string.
[19:28:00] <Fritz_> carpii, so jquery doesnt have anything that does it eh?
[19:29:12] <Fritz_> hmm, i'll google around, thx for your time
[19:29:24] <Chibby_> sorry Fritz_ i was directing that last comment at you
[19:29:58] <Fritz_> chibby, ok i see it
[19:29:58] <Fritz_> thx
[19:30:17] <carpii> Fritz, query doesn't need anything that does it, since javascript does it perfectly :)
[19:30:27] <Fritz_> heh, gotcha
[19:30:30] <carpii> don't be afraid to mix javascript with query, query isn't designed to replace javascript
[19:30:31] <Fritz_> thx guys
[19:30:32] <dnsdds> Is there a way to mimick target="_blank" inside a click event, instead of window.open()?
[19:30:42] <carpii> query == query of course
[19:30:44] <carpii> jquery
[19:30:46] * carpii sighs
[19:31:40] <Fritz_> w
[19:31:40] <Fritz_> carpii good to knoe
[19:48:00] <xp_prg> how can I change a slider's value dynamically with jquery so it shows on the screen if you will?
[19:48:20] <xp_prg> I have this but it doesn't alter the slider proper on the screen: console.log($("#price_slider").slider('value'),39 );
[19:50:16] <ngharo> .slider('value', 39)
[19:52:27] <xp_prg> ngharo it doesn't update the slider graphically
[19:52:50] <xp_prg> I am trying this to cause it but it doesn't work either:  $("#price_slider").trigger("slide")
[19:57:07] <ngharo> xp_prg: http://jsfiddle.net/8YrDj/
[19:59:10] <xp_prg> ngharo you humble me, wow that was cool
[20:00:46] <xp_prg> this doesn't work: $("#price_slider").slider('value', '1');
[20:01:19] <xp_prg> ngharo could I send an event to it or something?
[20:01:35] <ngharo> are you initializing it first?
[20:08:39] <xp_prg> yes I think so, my apolagies, I didn't write this code, it is attached to a hidden field, I tried updating that with $("#minPrice").val('39'); but that doesn't change it either
[20:09:06] <xp_prg> I try this: $("#price_slider").slider("refresh")
[20:09:10] <xp_prg> still won't update
[20:09:47] <xp_prg> console.log($("#price_slider").slider('value')); prints 39 so I know it is setting it
[20:10:40] <ngharo> got a link?
[20:10:46] <xp_prg> can't :(
[20:11:39] <xp_prg> can I send an event to it or call its change method or something?
[20:12:29] <ngharo> the point is that you shouldn't have to
[20:12:40] <xp_prg> ya I agree, wish I knew what else to try
[20:13:16] <ngharo> rip just the slider parts and throw it on jsfiddle
[20:13:37] <xp_prg> I apolagize I don't even know how to find all the parts, the code is kind of scattered
[20:15:11] <xp_prg> shouldn't this work: $("#price_slider").trigger("slide")
[20:15:18] <xp_prg> that calls the slide event on it?
[20:20:04] <xp_prg> this didn't even work: $("#price_slider").trigger('slide',{ ui: $('.ui-slider-handle', s), value: 39 });
[20:20:05] <ngharo> the events are there to bind on them to do actions
[20:20:26] <ngharo> it wont do anything unless you have bound a handler to them
[20:20:33] <xp_prg> ngharo running out of ideas, anything you can think I could try?
[20:21:39] <ngharo> not really, if it doesnt work with .slider('value', x) then something else is screwing it up
[20:24:00] <ngharo> xp_prg: what does the initial call to .slider() look like
[20:25:39] <xp_prg> http://jsfiddle.net/8YrDj/
[20:26:29] <xp_prg> does that answer your question?
[20:27:21] <ngharo> no, thats my fiddle you bunghole! lol
[20:27:29] <ngharo> i think you forgot to hit "update"
[20:27:33] <xp_prg> oops ok
[20:27:57] <xp_prg> don't see update anywhere
[20:28:04] <xp_prg> I see run fork, etc..
[20:28:35] <ngharo> ummm ok.. fork it then
[20:28:37] <ngharo> paste link
[20:28:44] <xp_prg> http://jsfiddle.net/3wPqH/1/
[20:28:47] <xp_prg> ok ya I forked it
[20:37:06] <ngharo> oh.  you have multiple values.  use .slider( "values" , index , [value] )
[20:38:51] <kratsg> $('li').on() doesn't work on a structure like <div><ul><li>...</li></ul></div> while $('li').live() does. Any ideas why?
[20:38:54] <ngharo> xp_prg: http://jsfiddle.net/3wPqH/3/
[20:39:16] <xp_prg> yup that is working wow!
[20:39:25] <ngharo> kratsg: are those li elements inserted dynamically?
[20:39:34] <kratsg> Yes, they are.
[20:39:49] <ngharo> that's why
[20:39:55] <kratsg> Explain further.
[20:40:38] <xp_prg> ngharo why doesn't it update the slider when I update the hidden variable?
[20:41:44] <xp_prg> ngharo how did you know it was using multipe values etc... ?
[20:42:06] <ngharo> kratsg: specify a parent selector like $('#ascendingDiv').on('click', 'li', function() { ... } );
[20:42:26] <ngharo> kratsg: when you call $('li'), those elements probably don't exist yet and nothing gets bound
[20:42:42] <ngharo> xp_prg: because your fiddle showed so
[20:43:01] <kratsg> Oh right, because it's dynamically added and you need a scope. D'oh.
[20:43:39] <ngharo> live actually binds to document iirc, so that's why it'll work
[20:43:42] <ngharo> due to event bubbling
[20:44:14] <xp_prg> how do I get the value: $('#price_slider').slider('value');
[20:44:20] <xp_prg> do I have to give an index?
[20:44:53] <ngharo> .slider('values', index)
[20:44:54] <ngharo> i believe
[20:45:18] <xp_prg> yup that is right
[20:47:27] <dnsdds> I'm having trouble binding a scroll event to an element with .on() -- doesn't seem to fire at all; what could be the issue?
[20:49:05] <ngharo> console.log( ) it.  does it return your element?
[20:51:40] <bobdobbs> Which method should I use to insert an html element inside another element?
[20:52:03] <ngharo> ?append @ bobdobbs
[20:52:04] <bot-t> bobdobbs, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[20:52:10] <bobdobbs> thanks
[20:56:07] <xp_prg> thanks again ngharo!
[20:56:30] <ngharo> yep np
[20:58:28] <dfd> aaa
[20:58:29] <charrly3> Hello, I was just wondering if jQuery want build with a particular design pattern in mind, and if so, which would it be?
[20:58:41] <charrly3> was* built
[21:00:17] <ngharo> awesomesauce design pattern
[21:00:46] <charrly3> sweeeeet, i knew it.
[21:03:23] <voidvector> charrly3, look at the source here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src
[21:03:54] <voidvector> i would say it uses jquery plugin pattern
[21:07:40] <charrly3> voidvector, thanks, didn't think to check github. Makes a little more sense after seeing it divided up like that.

[22:55:14] <takkun1946> possible stupid question...
[22:55:25] <takkun1946> is it possible to get a div via it's role?
[22:55:57] <Cork> role?
[22:56:06] <takkun1946> example... <div role="main"></div>  .... $('div[role=main])
[22:56:11] <Cork> sure
[22:56:23] <Cork> $('div[role="main"]')
[22:56:35] <takkun1946> hmmm... maybe i forgot the quotes
[22:57:03] <Cork> the "" quotes isn't strictly needed
[22:57:15] <takkun1946> seems it doesn't work
[22:57:24] <takkun1946> wait
[22:57:30] <takkun1946> i might know why
[22:57:52] <Hierofant> you didn't close the quotes
[22:58:20] <takkun1946> no... (nor are the quotes required)
[22:58:29] <takkun1946> i'm just an id10t
[22:58:46] <takkun1946> refactored my js file to better naming and forgot to update my html
[22:58:51] <Cork> takkun1946: it is depending on what characters you have in your attribute value
[22:59:02] <takkun1946> my apologies for wasting your time
[22:59:06] <Cork> but in this specific case its not (though its good practise to always add them)
[22:59:11] <takkun1946> Cork: agreed and understood
[23:05:25] <bobbobbins> hey, can someone tell me whats wrong with this: $('#import_form select').each( function(i, item){ console.log(item.val()); });
[23:05:41] <bobbobbins> its just supposed to loop through my selects and return what is selected
[23:05:53] <kostodo> how can I make an action based on a url #anchor
[23:06:15] <kostodo> i.e. if someone types site.com/#foo then do {...}
[23:08:13] <takkun1946> bobbobbins: is select a class for $('#import_form select')
[23:08:44] <bobbobbins> select is a <select>
[23:09:09] <takkun1946> ic ic... and the # is the id of said select, right?
[23:09:49] <bobbobbins> # is the id of the form...it goes through all the <select>s in my form
[23:10:49] <takkun1946> should be $('#import_form > select').each(....); right??
[23:11:09] <takkun1946> since the select's are children of the form
[23:11:22] <bobbobbins> i dunno
[23:11:28] <bobbobbins> i figured out my problem though
[23:11:36] <bobbobbins> it needed to be $(item).val()
[23:11:38] <smplstk> bobbobbins: http://jsfiddle.net/gBv9k/1/
[23:12:10] <bobbobbins> smplstk: thanks, but that only works on one select
[23:12:35] <bobbobbins> i got it solved though
[23:13:01] <smplstk> bobbobbins: the same code will work on may: http://jsfiddle.net/gBv9k/2/
[23:13:18] <smplstk> *many*, rather
[23:13:48] <bobbobbins> ah, i see, thanks
[23:21:49] <takkun1946> bobbobbins: yes... i missed that issue as well
[23:22:02] <bobbobbins> that always trips me up
[23:22:33] <takkun1946> so answer this... is it preferred to $varname or $(varname)
[23:22:38] <takkun1946> both seem to work just nicely
[23:23:22] <takkun1946> or is it more of personal preference
[23:24:36] <bobbobbins> $varname didn't work in my case...i had to use $(varname)
[23:25:04] <bobbobbins> im sure someone else can explain why better than me
[23:27:02] <talin_> hello. i think i finally found out why my .slideDown("slow") doesn't work... someone here helped me troubleshoot it yesterday. it turns out that if you put a simple slideDown inside a <form>, it won't display whatever it was you were hiding. it just "blinks"
[23:27:21] <talin_> like it displays it for a second
[23:30:35] <takkun1946> i prefer to use $(varname) myself... for readability, i guess
[23:31:24] <bobbobbins> they have different meanings though
[23:34:21] <takkun1946> oic... this i did not know
[23:34:45] <bobbobbins> i think most of the time you'd want $(varname) anyway though
[23:39:36] <smplstk> it depends what varname is, if you're all like...
[23:39:48] <smplstk> var varname = $( '.somediv' );
[23:39:54] <smplstk> and then $(varname)
[23:40:02] <smplstk> dat ain't rite
[23:40:34] <smplstk> yo dawg
[23:40:50] <ThePendulum> Greetings. IÂ´m sorry if you guys disapprove of my question in this certain channel. However, could any of you tell me what would be the best way to navigate through pages without ever actually reloading the webpage?
[23:41:10] <ThePendulum> The content of each page should not be loaded until you are visiting it
[23:41:23] <takkun1946> $.ajax and push state maybe?
[23:42:07] <takkun1946> smplstk: so var $varname = $('.somediv');
[23:42:29] <takkun1946> in order to use just $varname later on?
[23:42:51] <smplstk> ya, caching is where it's at.
[23:43:34] <coldhead> ThePendulum: try asking google about AJAX navigation
[23:57:36] <ThePendulum> coldhead: May I thank you
