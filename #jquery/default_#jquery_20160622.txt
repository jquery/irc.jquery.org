[00:14:20] <the4ndy123> so for the love of me I cant seem to figure out how to do an "onClick" for an HTML toggle switch...i would use getElementById but the ID is used to tell the HTML/CSS if its checked or not
[00:14:39] <the4ndy123> all my google searches point to the .toggle() command which doesnt seem to be related

[00:50:25] <Robdgreat> Prabhat: please stop spamming. What makes you think this is a jquery problem?
[00:51:33] <Prabhat> I am Sorry for that .But think so.Please help me
[00:52:53] <Prabhat> Robdgreat: I have used domas js that convert the dom element to png but formating not maintained
[00:53:34] <Robdgreat> I don't know how to do what you want. Canvas comes to mind
[00:54:51] <Prabhat> Robdgreat: domas uses canvas but no formatting
[00:55:12] <Robdgreat> Sorry, I've never used domas at all
[00:55:47] <Prabhat> Thanks for replay.If there are other method then please tell me
[00:56:07] <Robdgreat> I don't know how to do what you're trying to do, sorry
[00:56:16] <Prabhat> ok thanks
[00:56:53] <rubycrab_> You could use canvas, or you could do it using something like ImageMagick
[00:57:30] <rubycrab_> but you're in the jquery channel, not Javascript channel. That's a better location for things like Canvas
[00:58:01] <Prabhat> rubycrab_: Does this support formatted html to image?
[00:58:22] <rubycrab_> what do you mean formatted html to image?
[00:58:32] <rubycrab_> specifically, "formatted html"?
[00:59:58] <Prabhat> Thanks for reply: I have an image on which i want to write text and put images on it.Then want to convert that to single image
[01:00:26] <Prabhat> And all this is done through jquery ajax
[01:01:10] <Prabhat> I can set text and images on image but cant convert them to a single image.
[01:01:20] <rubycrab_> The image aspect (which you're asking about) is done through canvas The results might be sent through jquery, but that's like asking on a car forum about what kind of food is best in your car
[01:01:36] <rubycrab_> search for "canvas2image". This is most likley what you're looking for
[01:01:56] <Prabhat> ok
[03:10:48] <FilliasFog> hey guys, im looking at my network tab and i see i have some request over nonssl connection within my ssl website , i search for that url in my code and its not there. what do i miss?
[03:11:19] <Cork> FilliasFog: do you load external libs?
[03:11:33] <Cork> they might request with hardcoded urls
[03:13:22] <FilliasFog> yes
[03:14:01] <FilliasFog> may i pm u with the url cuz i cant find it and im getting crazy
[03:14:13] <Cork> sure
[05:48:26] <viewty> Hi all, if I've got an array of objects, one of the values is updated_on which stores a string "YYYY-DD-MM HH-MM-SS", how can I sort the array by updated_on?
[05:52:44] <Cork> viewty: as you luckely can sort by that string just use Array.prototype.sort
[05:53:34] <Cork> viewty: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#Description
[05:53:46] <Cork> you need the function solution you find if you scroll down a little
[05:53:47] <viewty> Great thanks
[05:54:45] <Cork> viewty: function(a,b) { if(a.updated_at < b.updated_at) { return -1; } else if(if(a.updated_at > b.updated_at) { return 1; } else { return 0; } }
[05:54:48] <Cork> something like that
[06:12:15] <an-kit> hello
[06:12:33] <an-kit> can anyone help me to solve jquery form validation?
[06:39:19] <moldy> how would i remove all children of an element except the first one?
[06:41:11] <moldy> ah, .slice()
[07:11:07] <moldy> what should i use for table sorting? the tablesorter.com thing?
[07:11:37] <decx> depends how much functionality you want
[07:13:03] <moldy> decx: sort when user clicks on column header is all i need
[07:13:21] <decx> check out this old thing then http://jsfiddle.net/decx/cb5fpLzp/
[07:15:48] <moldy> decx: nice, thanks
[07:39:09] <Qantourisc> A json POST request (with the correct parameters) send a JSON.stringify({}) as ["{","}"] instead of a dict
[07:39:26] <Qantourisc> (works when the dictionary is not empty)
[07:39:37] <Cork> by dictionary you mean an object?
[07:39:45] <Cork> ah ya you did
[07:39:59] <Qantourisc> yes sorry, using more then 1 programming language sucks :D
[07:40:12] <decx> dict is just another name for a map
[07:40:16] <Cork> hash, object dictionary, assosiated array
[07:40:20] <Cork> i don't get what the problem is :D
[07:40:49] <Cork> Qantourisc: could you make a jsfiddle?
[07:40:57] <Cork> cause as far as i know it works fine
[07:41:03] <Qantourisc> Cork: $.json({gereric_stuff_required_for_json:..., data=JSON.stringify({}) == boom
[07:41:07] <Qantourisc> ok i'll try
[07:41:10] <Cork> actualyl scratch that let me make one
[07:41:38] <Qantourisc> Cork: you need to set quite a few paramters for json, :p
[07:41:52] <Cork> Qantourisc: not really
[07:42:03] <Qantourisc> Well 3 :p
[07:42:08] <Cork> ya
[07:44:14] <Cork> Qantourisc: https://jsfiddle.net/xvfkmm8v/
[07:44:16] <Cork> works fine
[07:47:56] <Qantourisc> Cork: indeed / me test with the lib wrapping this stuff
[07:56:14] <Qantourisc> Cork: how does one include a script on the fiddle, I seem to fail epically
[07:56:32] <Cork> Qantourisc: you can add it to external resources
[07:56:37] <Cork> or if the script in it self is of interest
[07:56:45] <Cork> just put it at the start of the javascript section
[08:09:04] <Qantourisc> Cork: finally found it, stray function with the same name :/
[08:09:41] <taplar> heh, an actual naming collision?
[08:11:16] <Qantourisc> taplar: well 2 function, named differently, but the code was not deleted, as such it was calling the wrong code (but that's longer to explain)
[08:12:01] <taplar> hokay
[09:51:45] <yottabyte> I have a function that may or may not return a jqXHR depending on some conditions. I want to add .done to it, but it's null sometimes, so the callback in .done doesn't get hit. what's the best approach for this sort of thing? I can add the .done in the actual function when and if the ajax call is made?
[09:52:31] <yottabyte> in my function if I have like var jqXhr = null; if (call) jqXhr = $.get(...); return jqXhr;
[09:53:48] <Cork> yottabyte: return a $.Deferred() when you don't return the jqxhr
[09:54:12] <Cork> yottabyte: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[09:54:39] <yottabyte> so should I do var jqXhr = $.Deferred();?
[09:54:49] <Cork> eh, no
[09:54:54] <Cork> well you can if you like
[09:54:57] <Cork> but it isn't a jqXhr
[09:55:04] <yottabyte> wow
[09:55:08] <Cork> but it is what jqxhr extends
[09:55:24] <Cork> (it adds the abort method and a few other)
[09:55:35] <yottabyte> so a jqxhr is a deferred, but not vice versa
[09:55:41] <Cork> yes
[09:58:50] <Cork> yottabyte: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L523
[09:58:57] <Cork> there you have the interesting parts
[09:59:09] <yottabyte> is this the right idea: https://jsfiddle.net/ecrzhfkp/
[09:59:09] <Cork> if you look up you see how it defines the deferred and jqXHR
[09:59:19] <Cork> yes
[09:59:33] <Cork> well except it shouldn't be a global
[09:59:38] <Cork> one min
[09:59:43] <yottabyte> k
[10:04:29] <raid3n`> hi
[10:04:38] <raid3n`> colorbox-load
[10:04:41] <raid3n`>  $('#canvas_france a').each(function(i){$(this).attr('class', 'colorbox-load init-colorbox-node-processed-processed')});
[10:05:20] <raid3n`> the class has been created with success but the jquery colorbox_node.js is not called
[10:06:51] <Cork> raid3n`: https://jsfiddle.net/ecrzhfkp/1/
[10:07:01] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[10:07:17] <Cork> yottabyte: https://jsfiddle.net/ecrzhfkp/1/
[10:07:37] <Cork> raid3n`: don't modify class with attr
[10:07:45] <Cork> use addClass/removeClass
[10:08:04] <raid3n`> Cork, u sure than addClass working ?
[10:08:16] <raid3n`> yesterday i've been use this function but not success
[10:08:23] <Cork> raid3n`: the point is you shouldn't hard replace class attributes
[10:08:34] <Cork> cause other libs might need classes on the element, and you will break those if you do that
[10:08:35] <raid3n`> its for svg map

[10:09:47] <taplar> thank the J man for ignore
[10:11:30] <arc_> some clients will automatically start sending stuff if you paste too much into the editbox
[10:11:47] <arc_> so if you intended to edit it, you're screwed
[10:12:11] <Cork> well some clients send when it sees an \n in the text
[10:12:14] <Cork> that is what happens
[10:12:28] <arc_> ya if it doesn't have a multiline editbox
[10:12:28] <Cork> some (like hexchat) doesn't
[10:12:38] <Cork> multi line doesn't matter
[10:12:53] <Cork> its about if it sends on line break or not
[10:12:54] <raid3n`> Cork, its not good
[10:12:56] <raid3n`>     $('#canvas_france a').each(function(i){$(this).addClass('colorbox-node')});
[10:13:12] <Cork> raid3n`: like i tried to say before you flooded the channel
[10:13:25] <Cork> you should never hard replace all the classes on an element
[10:13:37] <Cork> it means no other code can ever touch that element, and that is really really bad
[10:13:59] <Cork> adding a class on the element won't mean javascript plugins will detect the element
[10:14:02] <raid3n`> yeah
[10:14:12] <Cork> so just setting the class won't help you
[10:14:19] <Cork> you have to notify the plugin about the update
[10:14:59] <km4> hi Cork, whats up :> ?
[10:15:12] <raid3n`> hmm
[10:15:22] <Cork> km4: trying to get an csv import solution working :I
[10:15:45] <Cork> mostly works but ya... multiple situations so stamping out edge cases
[10:35:34] <km4> Cork: what you use for this import ?
[11:02:54] <jerit> I'm trying to clear my text inputs... using .val(""); and .removeAttr("value"); do nothing
[11:03:52] <RattyWork> jerit: You probably have a problem with your selector then.

[11:04:35] <jerit> <input class="mdl-textfield__input" type="text" id="store_number" /> ... $("#store_number").removeAttr('value');
[11:04:50] <robertmaxrees> use .val('');
[11:04:59] <robertmaxrees> removeAttr() won't necessarily do whgat you want.
[11:05:07] <robertmaxrees> you sure that's a unique ID?
[11:05:47] <taplar> woah, robby is in here early today

[11:35:21] <taplar> that doesn't make sense.  but -1 would be a not found
[11:35:43] <sillyslux> so it went away :(

[11:53:15] <sillyslux> that's like full age
[12:05:56] <spliffy> Hello
[12:08:52] <spliffy> The custom jquery-ui widget example (https://jqueryui.com/widget/) mentions that the first part of a widget name is the namespace. It doesn't say anything about the relevance of namespaces. If i understand it correctly the widget is instantiated by calling .colorize(). Where does the namespace come into play here?
[12:10:01] <duch_kazatel> where are you seeing a reference to namespaces.
[12:10:17] <duch_kazatel> ah.  in the source.
[12:10:20] <spliffy> duch_kazatel: in the first javascript comment.
[12:10:45] <spliffy> duch_kazatel: when you click on view source
[12:10:56] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/
[12:11:03] <duch_kazatel> "namespace: The location on the global jQuery object that the widget's prototype is stored on. For example a namespace of "ui" indicates that the widget's prototype is stored on $.ui. "
[12:12:58] <spliffy> duch_kazatel: thank you. A better question: Since namespaces are used so components with the same name can live in them, how would i instantiate a widget that is available in multiple namespaces? I'm just asking out of curiousity
[12:13:12] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:13:17] <robertmaxrees> a widget wouldn;t in in multiples.
[12:13:32] <robertmaxrees> the prototype for a widget would only exist in one.
[12:14:19] <spliffy> robertmaxrees: not the same widget. For example, you could have a widget custom.combobox and another.combobox, or not?
[12:14:42] <robertmaxrees> ah, you mean name collisions across namespaces?
[12:14:57] <spliffy> robertmaxrees: yes, isn't this the reason for using namespaces?
[12:15:04] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:15:12] <spliffy> i see
[12:15:21] <robertmaxrees> the namespace is where the prototype for the widget is stored.
[12:15:35] <robertmaxrees> i'd guess that the second insantiated widget would be the one you'd end up using.
[12:15:42] <robertmaxrees> err, second declared widget, rather.
[12:22:21] <rocky> what's a currently maintained popular hash plugin these days?
[12:23:03] <robertmaxrees> window.location.hash? :)
[12:23:13] <robertmaxrees> what do you need it to do for you?
[12:24:42] <rocky> basically i'm inside an admin section so SEO is no issue... but i want to dynamically update parts of the page depending on query args in the hash tag... probably responding to hash change events
[12:25:14] <robertmaxrees> you know you don't need a lib for that, right?
[12:25:35] <rocky> of course, but i've used em in the past and it seemed to make parsing and such easier
[12:26:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd use whatever you've used in the past then.  otherwise you're looking for a router.
[12:27:29] <rocky> i think last time i used jquery bbq but that hasn't been touched in half a dozen years :/
[12:27:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah most people are using routers or the history api.
[12:28:15] <rocky> ok... recently maintained router or history plugin? :)
[12:28:36] <rocky> routie seems fairly recently modified
[12:28:41] <robertmaxrees> no need for a plugin for the history api depending on what sort of browser support you're looking for.  even then you could roll your own pretty easily.
[12:28:59] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, there are tons of js routers out there.
[12:31:16] <rocky> routie looks nice but the url's it matches don't quite conform to the structure i'd like to use ...  basically i'd like to respond to a change of any query arg ie...  #!saerch=foo&filter1=boo  ... so if filter1 changes, invoke function foo_handler, etc
[12:32:53] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'd just roll my own solution in that case.
[12:33:03] <robertmaxrees> but that's me.  hopefully you find something!
[12:39:14] <aro> any reason that jquery would be sending no-cache headers? i set cache: true in ajax
[12:39:29] <robertmaxrees> what kind of request is it?
[12:39:32] <aro> get
[12:39:42] <robertmaxrees> can you share some code?
[12:40:23] <robertmaxrees> and fwiw, cache: true just appends _={timestamp}
[12:40:40] <aro> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/67335837e36ddc0841f27c3bf665fe9b
[12:40:43] <aro> yeah
[12:40:46] <aro> but why isnt it doing it
[12:41:06] <robertmaxrees> you mean why isn't it appending the querystring param?
[12:41:25] <aro> why isnt it appending the timestamp
[12:41:32] <aro> and why is it sending no-cache headers
[12:41:48] <aro> i want these to be cached
[12:41:52] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't touch the no-cache headers for the request last i checked though I could be wrong.
[12:41:59] <robertmaxrees> no idea why it's not appending the qsp.
[12:42:04] <aro> Cache-Control:no-cache
[12:42:06] <aro> its sending that header
[12:42:10] <aro> i need it to be cached
[12:42:10] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[12:42:11] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[12:42:25] <aro> Pragma:no-cache
[12:42:25] <robertmaxrees> wait you don't want the QSP.  that's all the cache option controls.
[12:42:31] <aro> right i realized that
[12:42:40] <aro> but i mean why is it sending Pragma:no-cache as a header
[12:43:17] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14541077/why-is-cache-control-attribute-sent-in-request-header-client-to-server
[12:43:20] <robertmaxrees> might not be a jquery issue.
[12:46:04] <wisdomwolf> Time for the stupid question of the day!  I'm trying to select the next sibling with a .panel class for an element.  So far I was able to get the current .panel element with $(this).parents('.panel'), but making the next leap is stumping me
[12:46:43] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to do it.  what have you tried?
[12:47:39] <wisdomwolf> Tried to use the next adjacent selector, but couldn't figure out how to properly format the selector to reference the parent of my current element and select the next element with .panel class
[12:48:08] <robertmaxrees> try this: search google for "jquery next sibling"
[12:48:26] <taplar> it's not a one step operation though, most likely
[12:48:30] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[12:48:41] <robertmaxrees> you want to break the operations up - go to the parent, then go to the next one.
[12:48:49] <robertmaxrees> though then I have to ask: why do you want to do that?
[12:49:17] <wisdomwolf> That's an excellent question!  There might be a better/easier way to do what I'm trying to accomplish.
[12:50:21] <wisdomwolf> I'm backwards because I don't want tabs to focus on the panel headings.  However, if the panel is collapsed tab skips over all the inputs inside the panel.  I'd like it to expand the panel and properly set focus on the first element.
[12:50:40] <robertmaxrees> so you want to use the tab key to switch between panels.
[12:50:56] <robertmaxrees> and then focus on a particular input in that panel?
[12:51:16] <wisdomwolf> when on the last element in panel A,  expand panel B and set focus on element 1 in panel B, yes
[12:51:34] <taplar> what about shift tab?
[12:51:39] <robertmaxrees> errr
[12:51:58] <robertmaxrees> you just need to set tabindex and then hide/show whichever panel has a currently active input
[12:51:59] <taplar> going to handle for that too?
[12:52:08] <robertmaxrees> might not even need to se the index.
[12:57:44] <wisdomwolf> Hmm, I wonder if I could set the focus on the next element in a collapsed panel and see if it expands.
[12:57:53] <robertmaxrees> you're overthinking it :)
[12:58:02] <wisdomwolf> That's typical
[12:58:10] <wisdomwolf> but tab index didn't work. :(
[12:58:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah, won't need it here.
[12:58:26] <wisdomwolf> still skips over the inputs in a panel that's collapsed
[12:58:34] <robertmaxrees> wait "skips over"?
[12:58:42] <robertmaxrees> can you show us what you have in a jsfiddle?
[12:59:16] <wisdomwolf> yeah, gimme a sec to throw a section on JSFiddle
[13:00:36] <taplar> probably has a display none on them
[13:00:52] <robertmaxrees> ah good poin.
[13:00:55] <robertmaxrees> *point
[13:01:34] <taplar> might could put a class on the last element in each panel and bind the tab handler to those
[13:01:38] <Gnjurac> hi

[13:02:48] <robertmaxrees> might read the blog post about it.
[13:02:51] <taplar> google has 3.0
[13:03:01] <taplar> it's listed in the versions
[13:03:05] <Gnjurac> where can i find link
[13:03:13] <taplar> you just change out the version number
[13:03:18] <taplar> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#jquery
[13:03:24] <taplar> it lists which ones they have
[13:04:16] <Gnjurac> oh so i shoud just edit snippet
[13:04:20] <Gnjurac> to 3.0.0
[13:04:22] <taplar> yup
[13:04:22] <Gnjurac> cut they have it
[13:04:25] <Gnjurac> ok ty
[13:04:32] <taplar> they're not going to put all those links there dude, ;)
[13:04:56] <Gnjurac> yep got it
[13:06:38] <robertmaxrees> read the migration guide btw.
[13:06:41] <robertmaxrees> some big changes.
[13:06:42] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know select2 v4 well? Trying to figure out how to set values when it's initialized. I'm not sure if it's removing all my 'selected' attributes from options or if Mithril just isn't doing it properly
[13:06:44] <robertmaxrees> also no more old IE support

[13:19:57] <taplar> ^ wisdomwolf for ideas
[13:26:14] <ertl> hello guys, I have something like this: console.log(foo); $("#mydiv").load("bar.php #tappa",function(){ $("#tappa").val(foo)}); console.log displays the var, so I know that it's set, but when I try to put it into the val() it tells me it's empty... any hint? thanks
[13:26:43] <robertmaxrees> put the console log in the function.
[13:26:45] <taplar> load is an asynchronous task
[13:27:00] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:28:19] <ertl> robertmaxrees: you're right, with the console.log in the function it says empty string
[13:28:45] <robertmaxrees> so something is changing the variable out from under you.
[13:31:11] <ertl> robertmaxrees: sorry, but I don't get it... I'm just reloading a div and the load() call is just after the working console.log call... what could be changing it?
[13:31:25] <robertmaxrees> except it's not.
[13:31:27] <taplar> wisdomwolf: https://jsfiddle.net/d4912n69/2/ forwards and backwards
[13:31:30] <robertmaxrees> that version of .lad() is async.
[13:31:34] <robertmaxrees> *load
[13:31:50] <robertmaxrees> so something else could be changing that var between when the call is made and after it finishes.
[13:32:10] <robertmaxrees> so you've got some code somewhere messing with you.
[13:32:59] <ertl> robertmaxrees: ok, got it now, thanks
[13:36:04] <wisdomwolf> taplar: thanks, I couldn't get either JSFiddle or CodePen to co-operate with Bootstrap Collapse to demonstrate
[13:36:54] <wisdomwolf> Might be a dumb question, but is there any significance to naming variables with '$' prefix or just a naming convention to indicate that the variable reference came from JQuery?
[13:37:03] <taplar> that's all it is
[13:37:05] <robertmaxrees> *jQuery
[13:37:09] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, just a naming convention'
[13:39:08] <antraxis> yo jquery'ers. Anyone know good cms with admin panel but with rest api and easy to implement "login with facebook" ?
[13:39:36] <robertmaxrees> wordpress?
[13:39:37] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:39:53] <taplar> some reason that statement hurts my brain
[13:40:13] <robertmaxrees> it's sort of asking for a lot of different things haha
[13:44:04] <Gnjurac> does jquerry have bool
[13:44:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:45:00] <Gnjurac> i want to do if i allredy showed soemthing not to it agian on click
[13:45:18] <Gnjurac> var beh = true?
[13:45:21] <taplar> boolean
[13:45:24] <PantsOfChocolate> yes?
[13:45:25] <taplar> js has booleans
[13:45:26] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:45:30] <robertmaxrees> i'm way lost.
[13:45:31] <Gnjurac> yep booleans
[13:45:34] <PantsOfChocolate> yes
[13:45:42] <PantsOfChocolate> booleans exist in javascript
[13:46:00] <Gnjurac> and i can use them with jquerry
[13:46:00] <robertmaxrees> none of this has to do with jquery having booleans
[13:46:11] <taplar> jquery is javascript
[13:46:21] <taplar> visa vi
[13:46:34] <taplar> viza?
[13:46:41] <PantsOfChocolate> i like the javascript questions i can answer
[13:46:51] <PantsOfChocolate> close
[13:46:54] <robertmaxrees> Gnjurac that has nothing to do with what you need to do.
[13:46:54] <PantsOfChocolate> its vis a vis

[13:47:04] <taplar> heh
[13:47:33] <monk12> hey all, this is a general question for web devs... thought I'd ask here... I'd like to spell check a wordpress site. all the Wordpress plugins are outdated or dont work...
[13:47:45] <Gnjurac> i want to add when i click button set Boolean DidIt = true and sent on click  if DidIt==true dont do it agian
[13:47:46] <monk12> Textarea spellcheck solutions (chrome plugins) wont work (the Wordpress site may use things like Accordions where the textarea actually doesn't have all 50 FAQ items in an FAQ page... I'd have to click each 50 things to get a textarea and spellcheck each one individually.
[13:47:48] <taplar> try ##web
[13:47:53] <monk12> darn k.
[13:48:09] <Gnjurac> robertmaxrees:  so why i dont need bool?
[13:48:13] <PantsOfChocolate> just add an attribute to the button
[13:48:19] <PantsOfChocolate> and check if that exists?
[13:48:40] <Gnjurac> so when i click 20 imes butons will hav 20 atributs?
[13:48:45] <Gnjurac> isent that same as bool
[13:48:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:48:52] <taplar> i'm lost
[13:48:59] <robertmaxrees> you're really confused about what you need to do.
[13:49:04] <PantsOfChocolate> i get it
[13:49:12] <robertmaxrees> you only want to show an element once, right?
[13:49:19] <Gnjurac> no
[13:49:21] <Gnjurac> w8
[13:49:23] <PantsOfChocolate> he just wants to click a button, and basically every other click on that button checks if it has been clicked before?
[13:49:34] <Gnjurac> i will write slow and nice
[13:49:46] <robertmaxrees> even better - make a jsfiddle :)
[13:49:47] <taplar> ooooooooooh yeeeeeeeaaaaaah
[13:51:22] <Uhkis> sounds like a job for one()
[13:51:28] <kevireilly> Sounds like two options are data attributes and classes
[13:51:41] <robertmaxrees> i tend to avoid using one() tbh.
[13:51:43] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[13:52:54] <taplar> vis-a-vis.  seriously, am i the only one that pronounces it visa vi?
[13:53:11] <robertmaxrees> that's basically how you should pronounce it.
[13:53:44] <taplar> so glad i didn't try to go into english
[13:54:24] <robertmaxrees> to learn about a french phrase?
[13:54:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:54:45] <Gnjurac> I have a button. and when i click  i want it to run some stuff. So my button atm  has  $game.fadeToggle();  and $iframeGame.attr("src" .... so when i click the button it opens game window(iframe) and changes its src= to link i want). Now when i allready load game if i click button again i want to fade out but not to try to change iframe src again. So i need to add a bool so when i click First time button it will set itselft to true and  i will add to onCl
[13:54:49] <taplar> though i might have missed my opportunity to be the successor to dr seuss
[13:55:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you don't need to set a boolean Gnjurac
[13:55:34] <robertmaxrees> first, use .prop() instead of .attr()
[13:55:46] <Gnjurac> ok
[13:56:01] <robertmaxrees> second, you can get the value of the src - if it's not already set, do your logic.  if it is, do your other logic.
[13:56:44] <Gnjurac> so you just told me istned bool compere if (src= what it is on click) dont do that part
[13:56:53] <PantsOfChocolate> yea i pronounce it visa vi to haha
[13:56:56] <Gnjurac> thats same like bool just whit none
[13:56:57] <Gnjurac> xD
[13:57:09] <taplar> all conditionals resolve to a boolean
[13:57:19] <taplar> resolve/evaluate
[13:57:23] <robertmaxrees> Gnjurac i mean you don't need to great a whole new state object just to whole a boolean.
[13:57:28] <robertmaxrees> *create
[13:57:39] <robertmaxrees> just check to see what's up with the iframe and call it a day instead.
[13:58:11] * taplar thinks Gnjurac is a C programmer originally?
[13:58:20] <Gnjurac> c# but close
[13:58:24] <taplar> :)
[13:58:26] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[13:58:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't do that in JS.
[13:59:09] <PantsOfChocolate> ugh slack is being dumb
[13:59:15] <PantsOfChocolate> whats slack written in?
[13:59:28] <taplar> making variables to hold state is a double edged sword.  you have to way how much work they are saving you vs having to keep them in sync with what they represent
[13:59:37] <Gnjurac> how to read prop or attribut
[14:00:08] <robertmaxrees> .prop()
[14:00:12] <robertmaxrees> as i already said.
[14:00:21] <robertmaxrees> $('iframe').prop('src')
[14:00:26] <robertmaxrees> that's the getter syntax.
[14:00:27] <Gnjurac> missed it i guess
[14:00:43] <kevireilly> Gnjurac: this was before your additional explanation, but still might be useful in the future https://jsfiddle.net/a77an1zm/
[14:00:58] <robertmaxrees> that's another way to do it.
[14:07:36] <Gnjurac> oh it looks complicated for my nonJs eyes
[14:07:44] <robertmaxrees> it's really not.
[14:07:49] <Gnjurac> is there an   ! in js
[14:07:54] <taplar> yep
[14:08:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, negation?
[14:08:16] <Gnjurac> can i do if  (!$iframeGame.prop('src')=="BlaBla")
[14:08:22] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:08:22] <taplar> !==
[14:08:25] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:08:30] <Gnjurac> oh
[14:08:32] <Gnjurac> ok
[14:08:34] <Gnjurac> got it
[14:08:35] <taplar> i mean, technically you could
[14:08:43] <taplar> but it wouldn't give you what you expected
[14:08:55] <robertmaxrees> !$iframeGame.prop('src') would negate whatever .prop('src') returns
[14:08:57] <taplar> cause boolean == string is bad
[14:09:14] <robertmaxrees> also: you don't ever want to use == or !=, always === or !==
[14:11:16] <taplar> Gnjurac: have you done any general intro to js tutorials?
[14:11:22] <Gnjurac> nah ahhaha
[14:11:28] <taplar> i'd highly recommend it
[14:11:31] <Gnjurac> i did long ago
[14:11:38] <Gnjurac> somting small
[14:11:47] <Gnjurac> is there a console log
[14:12:13] <taplar> console.log('weeeee')
[14:12:15] <Gnjurac> like console.Log(blabla) to show it on my
[14:12:17] <Gnjurac> yep that
[14:12:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:12:25] <Gnjurac> ty
[14:12:33] <robertmaxrees> there's also a full blown debugger in your browser.
[14:12:41] <Gnjurac> yep i know
[14:13:07] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 lots of good info w/r/t js and jquery debugging.  good refresher.
[14:14:55] <Gnjurac> am doing something wrong
[14:15:20] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle or something then.
[14:15:33] <Gnjurac> https://jsfiddle.net/6zkc8yu6/
[14:15:53] <Gnjurac> i copyed just code no html
[14:16:03] <Gnjurac> i added Denis and badword
[14:16:05] <Gnjurac> just to check
[14:16:14] <robertmaxrees> so are those logs firing?
[14:16:14] <Gnjurac> and when i click button bothe run alwies
[14:16:25] <Gnjurac> yep
[14:16:33] <Gnjurac> but allwies i get both den and pen
[14:16:46] <robertmaxrees> so what doesn't work?
[14:17:11] <Gnjurac> so  densis shoud run alwies right
[14:17:19] <robertmaxrees> *always, and sure.
[14:17:33] <Gnjurac> and pen shoud run only when  $iframeGame.prop('src')!="/home/me/WebSajt/WebGLversion/game.html"
[14:17:34] <robertmaxrees> so what doesn't work?
[14:17:42] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:17:43] <Gnjurac> they run both all time
[14:17:57] <Gnjurac> when i click on console log i get both den and pen
[14:18:00] <Gnjurac> evry click
[14:18:12] <robertmaxrees> how many elements have the iGame id?
[14:18:29] <Gnjurac> 2
[14:18:32] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[14:18:35] <robertmaxrees> can't repeat IDs.
[14:18:46] <robertmaxrees> IDs have to be unique on the page
[14:19:01] <robertmaxrees> and .prop() only works as a gett for the first one.
[14:19:23] <Gnjurac> nah i got you worng #Game is a div that contains 2 elements
[14:19:31] <robertmaxrees> #iGame
[14:19:36] <Gnjurac> i upload all code if you promis dont laught at me xD
[14:19:44] <robertmaxrees> i don't want it all.
[14:19:47] <robertmaxrees> add the html.

[14:21:22] <Gnjurac> you must laught how can i prosper if not flamed by masters
[14:21:36] <robertmaxrees> added jquery for you and removed the body tag since you don't need it: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p5eg8LL7/1/
[14:22:12] <robertmaxrees> also: please don't use that work in console logs.
[14:22:13] <robertmaxrees> thanks :)
[14:22:34] <Gnjurac> sorry i frogot to change
[14:22:53] <robertmaxrees> also: you're confused about how the source works.
[14:23:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p5eg8LL7/2/
[14:23:05] <robertmaxrees> see the problem?
[14:23:51] <Gnjurac> i dont see nay outptu here will devconosle show me
[14:24:02] <robertmaxrees> open your dev tools, yeah
[14:24:10] <robertmaxrees> the issue is the src isn't what you think it is.
[14:24:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p5eg8LL7/3/ this is much closer to what you want.
[14:25:36] <robertmaxrees> aaaaand with that, lunch.

[14:51:38] <lu_tze> question, if I'm manually setting window.location.hash on page load, how do I prevent it from jumping to the current #element, i.e. like event.preventDefault() when using click() events?
[14:52:17] <lu_tze> scrollToTop works as a hack, but it's not pretty.
[14:53:06] <taplar> not sure that you can prevent that.  that's sorta in the browsers domain at that point
[14:54:13] <taplar> why hash the url if you don't want to go to it?
[14:58:40] <lu_tze> it's a SPA so the content get's loaded from JSON. The nav links are just divs with role=button that changes the hash, which fires an hashchanged event that loads the desired content.
[15:00:51] <taplar> so the hash already exists when they click the associated link for it?
[15:03:03] <decx> a hash based spa? what is this the 18th century ^^
[15:03:15] <lu_tze> taplar: thanks for your input but found a solution.
[15:03:21] <taplar> hokay
[15:03:55] <lu_tze> decx: something like that :)
[15:06:52] <taplar> visiting a spa with some hash, sounds relaxing
[15:52:17] <relipse> can somsone help me, I tried adding 3 owl carousel plugins to my page and they show up totally messed up - https://www.handofhelp.com/resources/
[16:03:53] <kedgen> Hello, I'm having an issue where I can't seem to catch a custom event triggered using $.trigger(). The handler and triggered event are both on the same DOM element
[16:04:13] <kedgen> I read something about needing to potentially wrap the event handler in $(document).ready(), anyone have experience with this issue?
[16:05:03] <kedgen> http://pastebin.com/dSZw0ZvE
[16:05:42] <kedgen> the code exists in two different controllers, but these are the lines that control the event triggering and handling
[16:05:48] <taplar> what do you get if you put console.log($panel.length); first?
[16:06:27] <kedgen> Well I tried console.log($panel) before both the trigger and the handler and found that the element exists and is the same in both cases
[16:07:56] <taplar> so logging the element showed it in the object?
[16:08:15] <robertmaxrees> kedgen put the length on there.
[16:08:44] <kedgen> ok, I'll try it real quick
[16:08:46] <kedgen> brb
[16:10:15] <kedgen> length of the element is 1 right before both the triggering of the event and the adding of the event handler
[16:10:48] <taplar> should be fine then.  what is 'this' ?
[16:11:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you sure you're binding the right handler?
[16:12:29] <kedgen> it's a custom event called "panelPushed" and I can confirm that the event name is the same for trigger and on
[16:12:42] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i asked :)
[16:12:44] <robertmaxrees> the handler.
[16:12:44] <kedgen> checking value of `this` but should be two different controller objects
[16:12:51] <kedgen> oh, I think so but I will double check
[16:12:53] <taplar> console.log(this.panelPushed)
[16:13:02] <taplar> err, onPanelPushed
[16:13:50] <kedgen> checkin it out atm
[16:15:26] <kedgen> So this is a controller in the case of the .on and is the Window object where it's being triggered (however the area where it's triggered is not relying on `this`)
[16:15:41] <kedgen> and yes it is the correct handler, I console logged it and it's the very same
[16:16:30] <robertmaxrees> so the right handler is getting bound - you sure your handler is bound before you trigger it?
[16:17:00] <kedgen> robertmaxrees, no I suppose I haven't checked that... I think you may be on to something. Do you know of a way to check that?
[16:17:10] <robertmaxrees> console logs before each.
[16:18:00] <kedgen> Yes, it is attached before it's fired
[16:18:14] <kedgen> *before the event is fired
[16:18:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah then something funky is up.
[16:18:44] <robertmaxrees> what if you try a delegated listener instead?
[16:20:12] <kedgen> robertmaxrees, not sure if I'm familiar with that, can you point me to some documentation?
[16:20:27] <kedgen> like a jquery method?
[16:20:29] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[16:20:34] <kedgen> thanks
[16:20:37] <robertmaxrees> slightly different syntax for .on
[16:21:30] <kedgen> Ah, ok yeah I do know what that is I just didn't know the terminology :P That's a good idea, I will try that and report back
[16:24:34] <kedgen> do you happen to know what the syntax for $.trigger is when using delegated events? is it similar to on? ex: $(document).trigger("myEvent", "mySelector", myFunc);
[16:24:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:24:43] <robertmaxrees> exact same.
[16:24:48] <robertmaxrees> you still trigger on the element.
[16:24:52] <robertmaxrees> you only change the listener.
[16:25:02] <kedgen> ok so I can keep $panel.trigger
[16:25:16] <robertmaxrees> most events events bubble.
[16:25:19] <robertmaxrees> custom ones still should.
[16:25:21] <kedgen> ok, cool
[16:25:25] <kedgen> thank you, gonna try this
[16:27:32] <kedgen> robertmaxrees that worked! üèÜ Thank you!
[16:27:47] <robertmaxrees> that means the element was getting removed somewhere and readded after binding the listener.
[16:27:49] <robertmaxrees> that's my guess.
[16:27:59] <kedgen> Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me with this site
[16:28:38] <kedgen> I'm not the first to work on it and it's got a bit of a weird system going on wherein all kinds of dom events are there by default and then altered as opposed to being added when needed
[16:28:42] <kedgen> er
[16:28:46] <kedgen> dom elements not events
[16:29:05] <kedgen> so they are changing quite often
[16:29:10] <robertmaxrees> yeesh.
[16:29:15] <kedgen> Yeah...
[16:29:41] <kedgen> anyway, wasn't my idea and I'm not in a position to rehaul the whole thing
[16:29:49] <kedgen> so, working with what I got for the moment
[16:30:15] <kedgen> anyway, thank you for the help, much appreciated
[16:30:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:36:12] <Samy__> Hi I was parsing data from json which had var a=[{}] var b =[{},{},{}] but I get a syntax error.Cant variables be used in .json?
[16:36:37] <robertmaxrees> JSOn cannot contain variable declarations.
[16:36:54] <iDentity1337> Hello, i need some help. I was making some kind of registration, and due to the nature of select option, i had to use a for loop to generate the images and id's to <a> element. Now i gotta make an onClick event to get the id of that particular element and store it in GLOBAL variable so I can use it later.
[16:37:02] <Samy__> then what can be a solution to this declaration
[16:37:27] <robertmaxrees> Samy__ what does the data actually look like?
[16:37:40] <robertmaxrees> iDentity1337 make a fiddle.
[16:39:47] <iDentity1337> robertmaxrees, i will do it asap, afk few mins. i will quote you again
[16:39:57] <robertmaxrees> just put it out to the room.
[16:41:48] <Samy__> something like this  http://pastebin.com/C7jis8rm
[16:41:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah you can't do that.
[16:42:07] <robertmaxrees> you could do an object with those as properties.
[16:42:47] <Samy__> so basically { [ {} ] , [{}{}] } like this?
[16:42:54] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:42:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:43:12] <Samy__> an object with nested objects and arrays ;D
[16:43:15] <robertmaxrees> {a: [that doesn't really mean anything and is invalid.
[16:44:10] <Samy__> Not using the var and rest the same just putting everything in an object is that good?
[16:44:28] <robertmaxrees> also you need to quote all prop names.
[16:44:59] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, you can make those props on an object instead.
[16:46:34] <Samy__> basically { "a" : [ {keys} ] , "b" : [ { } , { } ] } something like this
[16:46:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:46:53] <Samy__> it looks correct i suppose :)
[16:47:05] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you can't just make an actual example (shrug)
[16:47:51] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, just do some actual JSON and you'll be fine./
[16:48:05] <Samy__> actual JSON ? :D
[16:48:14] <robertmaxrees> JSON is not the same as javascript.
[16:48:19] <robertmaxrees> some different rules.
[16:48:23] <Samy__> Also If I want to fetch a and b how can i do that
[16:48:35] <robertmaxrees> how are you getting the JSON in the first place?
[16:48:52] <Samy__> in the first place means here?
[16:48:59] <iDentity1337> Jesus i lost the file, i'll just write on pastebin what i'm trying to accomplish and what i currently have..
[16:49:08] <robertmaxrees> Samy__ huh?
[16:49:17] <robertmaxrees> Samy__ are you fetching this via ajax or something?
[16:49:25] <Samy__> no via .js
[16:49:29] <Samy__> using parse
[16:49:44] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[16:50:24] <Samy__> the json is 254 lines :D
[16:50:32] <robertmaxrees> i mean how are you calling the file?
[16:50:46] <robertmaxrees> becuase you just need to access the a and b props on the parsed object.
[16:51:18] <Samy__> let me show it
[16:53:07] <Samy__> http://pastebin.com/qd8RS26r
[16:53:29] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:53:36] <robertmaxrees> so where in here are you pulling in the JSON?
[16:53:45] <robertmaxrees> you're assuming i know much more about your codebase than i could.
[16:54:02] <iDentity1337> robertmaxrees, no worries, i'm an idiot.
[16:54:10] <robertmaxrees> iDentity1337 oh?  figure it out?
[16:54:13] <iDentity1337> yeah
[16:54:18] <robertmaxrees> what was the issue?
[16:54:18] <iDentity1337> i'll just add a class 'active' on click
[16:54:24] <iDentity1337> of that specific rank
[16:54:30] <iDentity1337> and on submit, get the id that has the class
[16:54:39] <Samy__> datasetfilename=".json"
[16:55:22] <robertmaxrees> Samy__ so I assume parser.parseFromUrl() is pulling in the file and parsing it into a js object?
[16:55:23] <sillyslux> parser.parseFromUrl(datasetUrl, validateDataset); i assume this fetches the json?
[16:55:28] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:55:33] <sillyslux> :/
[16:55:34] <sillyslux> sry
[16:55:40] <Samy__> yes
[16:55:45] <robertmaxrees> then dataset is your object.
[16:55:47] <robertmaxrees> dataset.a
[16:55:50] <robertmaxrees> dataset.b
[16:55:50] <robertmaxrees> etc
[16:56:00] <robertmaxrees> assuming that's how it returns the data.
[16:56:05] <robertmaxrees> that looks wrong though.
[16:56:14] <robertmaxrees> since parser.parseFromUrl is probably async
[16:57:16] <Samy__> :/
[16:57:20] <robertmaxrees> is it?
[16:58:12] <sillyslux> dataset is probably a "Promise" object when you do "var dataset = parser.parseFromUrl(datasetUrl, validateDataset);"
[16:58:28] <Samy__> I am a little confused about the fetching. Firstly I had all this in my .js where I could use variables and now I have shifted everything in .json
[16:58:30] <sillyslux> set a breakpoint on this line and see for yourself
[16:59:10] <robertmaxrees> can you show us what parseFromUrl looks like?
[17:00:46] <Samy__> means the .json?
[17:00:50] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:00:53] <robertmaxrees> the actual code.
[17:01:22] <Samy__> Its a project. What snippet can I show
[17:01:26] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:01:33] <robertmaxrees> so parser.parseFromUrl is a function.
[17:01:39] <robertmaxrees> what's the code from that function?
[17:01:47] <robertmaxrees> what does it return?
[17:01:50] <sillyslux> function parseFromUrl(){...} in var parser = {}
[17:02:04] <robertmaxrees> or parseFromUrl: function() {} or whatever
[17:02:47] <sillyslux> Samy__, confused... haha
[17:03:04] * sillyslux being silly
[17:05:24] <Samy__> parseFromUrl is inbuilt i suppose when you are parsing from a url i.e another file
[17:05:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:05:36] <robertmaxrees> "inbuilt" to...?
[17:05:58] <sillyslux> where do you get parser from?
[17:06:10] <sillyslux> is there a parser lib you include?
[17:06:24] <robertmaxrees> ^ links to docs or anything would be super helpful here.
[17:09:24] <Samy__> parser is just an id that i have used in the markup language to fetch it there
[17:10:17] <sillyslux> parser from parser.parseFromUrl(datasetUrl, validateDataset)
[17:10:22] <sillyslux> is just an id?!
[17:10:52] <Samy__> yes
[17:11:13] <sqram> https://jsfiddle.net/5rnxtc6o/  why does index work for bar, but not food? they have the exact same elements
[17:11:34] <sqram> $(this).siblings() returns the exact same elements a $(this).parent().children()
[17:11:44] <sillyslux> so you made up that parseFromUrl? "sounds fitting, javascript will know what to do?"
[17:12:11] <sillyslux> id of what?
[17:12:33] <Samy__> id of a component in QML to let it be used in .js
[17:15:09] <sillyslux> qml as in "QML (Qt Meta Language or Qt Modeling Language) is a user interface markup language. It is a JSON-like declarative language for designing user interfaceñcentric applications. Inline JavaScript code handles imperative aspects. It is part of Qt Quick, the UI creation kit developed by Nokia within the Qt framework."
[17:15:55] <Samy__> yes
[17:19:08] <sillyslux> i found "parser.parseFromUrl" being used here https://api.kde.org/extragear-api/edu-apidocs/gcompris/src/core/html/Wordlist_8qml_source.html
[17:19:14] <sillyslux> not very promising...
[17:19:19] <robertmaxrees> errr
[17:19:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:19:58] <sillyslux> lol?
[17:20:08] <robertmaxrees> just funny.
[17:20:14] <sillyslux> krkrkr...
[17:21:10] <Samy__> yes it had the id: parser thats what the same I am doing
[17:21:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:22:08] <Samy__> parser is just an id nothing more
[17:22:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:22:22] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't make any sense.
[17:22:24] <sillyslux> https://api.kde.org/extragear-api/edu-apidocs/gcompris/src/core/html/Wordlist_8qml_source.html
[17:22:31] <sillyslux> hey.. no
[17:22:39] <sillyslux> http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-javascript-topic.html
[17:22:54] <sillyslux> ^ seems to be close to the docs you need
[17:23:15] <sillyslux> are you sure you're in the right channel Samy__ ?
[17:24:06] <Samy__> The topic got dragged from one point to the other :D I just asked about fetching json variables :D
[17:24:16] <robertmaxrees> that's... not what you were asking at all hahaha
[17:24:18] <robertmaxrees> but alright.
[17:24:38] <Samy__> I meant fetching "a" and "b"
[17:24:44] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:24:58] <robertmaxrees> which depends on how you get the data in the first place.
[17:25:14] <robertmaxrees> but you just access those properties on whatever object that is.
[17:27:12] <Samy__> https://paste.kde.org/pzckas6nl
[17:27:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:27:49] <sillyslux> Samy__, have you been in #qt?
[17:28:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, none of this is even using jQuery.
[17:28:13] <Samy__> not yet
[17:28:26] <robertmaxrees> are you using qt?
[17:28:29] <robertmaxrees> or something like that?
[17:28:35] <Samy__> Yes
[17:28:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah, hit up one of those channels then.
[17:29:12] <Samy__> thanks :)
[17:29:29] <sillyslux> maybe even #kde
[18:13:11] <nux> hope this is a good spot to ask this - could someone help me change the value of Monthly for $9.99 here: http://jsfiddle.net/zyf7bs2a/70/
[18:13:23] <nux> this is a small chunk of a larger form
[18:16:44] <sillyslux> http://jsfiddle.net/zyf7bs2a/72/ there, i've changed it to 19.99 for you
[18:16:59] <sillyslux> but i want 30%
[18:17:48] <nux> if you want a discount on a vpn service id be happy to lol
[18:17:49] <nux> thanks
[18:18:08] <nux> er..with javascript
[18:18:20] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[18:18:46] <nux> previous ive been doing $('#payment_term_0').after('more html');
[18:18:54] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[18:18:56] <nux> but i am trying to replace the text
[18:18:57] <robertmaxrees> you want to change text.
[18:19:06] <nux> ya. sorry for not being more clear
[18:19:48] <nux> copying a form from one project to another and my previous way of doing it wont work here
[18:20:00] <robertmaxrees> you want .text()
[18:20:17] <sillyslux> http://jsfiddle.net/zyf7bs2a/73/
[18:20:30] <robertmaxrees> though that'll replace all contents.
[18:20:50] <nux> there it is! the .first()
[18:20:51] <nux> thank you
[18:21:04] <sillyslux> holD!!
[18:21:11] <sillyslux> robertmaxrees> though that'll replace all contents.
[18:21:11] <nux> hrmm
[18:21:11] <robertmaxrees> i might use .filter() instyead.
[18:21:13] <sillyslux> :(
[18:21:13] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[18:21:30] <nux> is there a way to do it without replacing the <input> tag there?
[18:21:48] <robertmaxrees> .html() and replace just the stuff you want.
[18:21:51] <nux> maybe i should just redo the html so i can just grab the label by id
[18:22:24] <sillyslux> hey... why is there no .second() ??
[18:22:41] <robertmaxrees> because then you need a .third() .fourth() .fifth()...
[18:22:41] <sillyslux> maybe i should try .2nd()?
[18:22:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:24:50] <nux> i can find the text in the inspector, but not sure how to change it
[18:25:11] <robertmaxrees> you have to get all the markup using .html() and then .replace() is.
[18:25:12] <robertmaxrees> *it
[18:25:32] <nux> if i console.log($('#payment_term_0')); i can find the text in labels[0].innerText
[18:25:41] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're messing with grabbing textnodes
[18:26:09] <nux> i think i just need to move the input so it's outside the label
[18:26:18] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[18:26:30] <nux> http://jsfiddle.net/zyf7bs2a/76/
[18:26:44] <nux> label1.whatToDoToChangeOnlyText()
[18:26:50] <robertmaxrees> i just told you.
[18:26:58] <robertmaxrees> grab the html with .html() then .replace() the thing you want.
[18:27:03] <nux> ok ty
[18:27:12] <nux> that makes sense. sorry was over in jsfiddle and didnt see that
[18:27:15] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[18:30:25] <sillyslux> http://jsfiddle.net/zyf7bs2a/77/
[19:30:12] <ertl> Hi, which is the proper way to do a replace where the search pattern is a regex made with a concatenation of a string and a variable? I'm trying to do something like this: str=str.replace(/string+variable,'newstring');
[19:30:42] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp
[19:30:51] <robertmaxrees> need to use the RegExp constructor to do that.
[19:31:23] <ertl> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[20:12:16] <B4daBing73> Hi
[20:13:00] <B4daBing73> Does anyone have experience building a hybrid app with jQuery Mobile for Android and iOS?
[20:49:25] <sqram> https://jsfiddle.net/5rnxtc6o/2/  why does foo return a negative index?
[20:56:15] <sillyslux> $(this).siblings('li') returns an array with all the other li's, not including the element itself
[20:57:30] <sqram> ah. thank you
[21:01:11] <sillyslux_> $(this).siblings('li') returns an array with all the other li's, not including the element itself
[21:04:29] <sillyslux_> sqram, https://jsfiddle.net/5rnxtc6o/3/
