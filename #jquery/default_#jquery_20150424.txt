[00:00:08] <Cork> it will give wrong info quite often
[00:00:19] <Cork> (and in some cases lock things up)
[00:01:58] <DragonPunch> hey cork
[00:02:05] <Cork> o/
[00:02:10] <DragonPunch> 					var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
[00:02:10] <DragonPunch> 					console.log(filesarr[0]);
[00:02:11] <DragonPunch> 					xhr.open("POST", "/magic", true);
[00:02:11] <DragonPunch> 					xhr.send(filesarr[0]);
[00:02:13] <DragonPunch> why wont that work
[00:02:20] <Cork> don't dump code in the channel
[00:02:25] <DragonPunch> what should i use
[00:02:30] <Cork> ?paste
[00:02:30] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:02:50] <DragonPunch> okay gotchya
[00:02:50] <Cork> anyway to answer the question

[00:02:58] <Cork> ?mdn formdata
[00:02:58] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[00:03:04] <DragonPunch> yeah i dont get it though
[00:03:05] <DragonPunch> what do i need
[00:03:11] <luaboy> Cork :why condole.log(key) prints '0' out? the keys have values
[00:03:27] <DragonPunch> filesarr[0] is a file object
[00:03:36] <DragonPunch> though my server when i print it out
[00:03:42] <Cork> DragonPunch: you can't send files with ajax
[00:03:42] <DragonPunch> is giving me a {} response
[00:03:44] <Cork> check the link
[00:04:02] <DragonPunch> you can?
[00:04:07] <DragonPunch> drag and drop upload.
[00:04:09] <DragonPunch> eveyrone does it.
[00:04:16] <Cork> check the link
[00:04:26] <DragonPunch> i have already
[00:04:33] <Cork> apparently you haven't
[00:04:43] <DragonPunch> i need to attach it to a form?
[00:04:46] <Cork> cause then you wouldn't try to send a file directly in .send
[00:04:49] <Cork> no
[00:05:04] <DragonPunch> ok let me see
[00:05:34] <Cork> specifically what you want is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData/append
[00:05:45] <Cork> it even have an example
[00:06:31] <DragonPunch> after the append
[00:06:33] <DragonPunch> how do you send
[00:06:45] <Cork> by sending the object?
[00:06:52] <DragonPunch> oh
[00:06:57] <DragonPunch> let me try
[00:07:03] <DragonPunch> i think my tutorial was bad
[00:08:15] <DragonPunch> do i have to provide a 3rd param
[00:08:30] <DragonPunch> formData.append('userpic', myFileInput.files[0], 'chris.jpg');
[00:08:56] <DragonPunch> if im doing a file
[00:09:41] <DragonPunch> lemme try
[00:10:35] <DragonPunch> aw sweet
[00:10:36] <DragonPunch> i tworked
[00:10:39] <DragonPunch> it worked

[00:28:14] <luaboy> mooncup:how do I create a table dynamiclly by the .getjson result
[00:28:37] <mooncup> you would have to loop through the json and build up the table
[00:29:01] <luaboy> is there s jsffidle?
[00:41:24] <santanam> hello :P
[00:42:22] <Xatenev> santanam: hello
[00:47:57] <no_gravity> Good Morning! Does jquery have a function to get parameters from the querystring?
[00:53:26] <Xatenev> no_gravity: no but u can use plain JS for that
[00:53:33] <no_gravity> sure
[00:53:50] <no_gravity> surprising it's not in jquery.
[00:54:28] <lilsammy__> fullcalendar is infuriating me
[00:54:54] <lilsammy__> logging the visible start end times to console gives this format... Fri May 01 2015 00:00:00 GMT+0100 (GMT Daylight Time)
[00:55:06] <lilsammy__> any time I try to use that it comes out as 1431212400
[00:55:18] <lilsammy__> no matter how I try and convert it before sending its not having it
[00:55:21] <dimi1947> I am trying to append to 2 divs the members of an array...first I hide the content found there and then try to use find,append and a for loop to do it but I cannot here the jsbin http://jsbin.com/qudaro/23/
[00:56:12] <dimi1947> all these are suppose to happen with the clicking of the submit button-submit function called
[00:57:02] <ilhami> :O
[00:57:07] <ilhami> relax guys.
[01:00:35] <Uhkis> damn jsbin is bad
[01:06:14] <dimi1947> Uhkis...are you referring to my jsbin?
[01:06:31] <Uhkis> dimi1947: jsbin itself
[01:07:14] <Uhkis> dimi1947: so what are you trying to put where?
[01:07:43] <Uhkis> dimi1947: those input values in to an array?
[01:08:25] <dimi1947> I am trying to put 2 members of an array at each respective div...these divs have the name of monday and tuesday
[01:09:07] <dimi1947> one member in one div and the other member to the other div IN PLACE OF THE INPUT BOXES...WHICH I TRY TO HIDE FIRST
[01:09:18] <lilsammy__> holy balls fullcalandar is so bad, says I can specify data vars in my ajax call, specify them and it completely ignores them so I spent 2 hours trying to format vars I can't seem to even change :@ this isn't frustrating at all
[01:09:43] <Uhkis> ?demo @ lilsammy__
[01:09:44] <b-ot> lilsammy__: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:09:48] <dimi1947> the array name is test
[01:09:56] <dimi1947> line 40
[01:10:21] <lilsammy__> doing it now
[01:11:06] <dimi1947> just want text in the place of input boxes...within these two divs
[01:11:42] <lilsammy__> uhkis making demo now, this is code though http://pastebin.com/i7FEVUmg 2 minutes for demo
[01:15:28] <Uhkis> dimi1947: http://jsfiddle.net/1qdzhhw9/3/ like this?
[01:16:46] <dimi1947> Uhkis: yes like this...thanks
[01:17:44] <dimi1947> the only thing that surpises me is what did you do with input boxes?
[01:18:29] <Uhkis> replaced them
[01:19:25] <dimi1947> yes...this happens without any specific code...that is what surprisez me
[01:20:33] <Uhkis> dimi1947: http://jsfiddle.net/1qdzhhw9/4/ no they're only hidden
[01:20:38] <Uhkis> now*
[01:22:04] <dimi1947> what do you think is better?replace or hide or it depends what I want to do with them>
[01:28:22] <lilsammy__> Uhkis still trying to get this demo working this is a bigger headache than my actual code
[01:31:02] <lilsammy__> Uhkis http://jsfiddle.net/xjo255uL/2/ but somthing odd is happening with jquery throwing an error it doesn't throw in my code
[01:34:47] <Uhkis> dimi1947: if you need to use them afterwards, better just hide
[01:48:08] <betz> I am trying to have the jQuery autocomplete widget to show different categories within their own UL instead of one UL. I need to float the categories next to each other... Anyone knows how this coud be done? https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#categories
[01:49:59] <luaboy> why $list.trigger not triger the event ?
[01:50:29] <Cork> luaboy: you need to share context for anyone to answer that
[01:51:12] <Uhkis> lilsammy__: that error is really weird, like that property is being executed as a function
[01:51:28] <Cork> betz: check the _render function
[01:51:57] <Cork> betz: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-_renderItem
[01:52:09] <luaboy> Cork:http://paste.ubuntu.com/10877138/
[01:52:09] <Cork> (and the other _render* functions)
[01:53:01] <luaboy> Cork:the function 'updateList ' is not called
[01:53:07] <lilsammy__> Yeah Uhkis I think its somthing to do with the version of fullcalendar I am using. I thought it was 2 but its 1.6 I will go see about updating now
[01:54:12] <Cork> luaboy: can't say much more then "it should work"
[01:54:45] <Cork> luaboy: btw you don't want to run that code in an each loop
[01:54:48] <luaboy> Cork:the code has no errors?
[01:55:07] <Cork> luaboy: its a dead code dump, i can't say for sure
[01:55:19] <Cork> i don't have built in dependency resolving -_-'
[01:55:34] <Cork> ?demo

[01:56:48] <Uhkis> syntax hilighting and no commented out code helps ;-)
[01:56:58] <Cork> not really
[01:57:35] <Cork> syntax highlighting helps when you're already familiar with the code and the data it works with
[01:57:36] <luaboy> Cork:that is only one element in each
[01:58:00] <Cork> luaboy: your adding an event listener to a single element for each loop
[01:58:07] <Cork> so yes there is a problem there
[01:58:27] <Uhkis> defining function in a loop is also kinda weird
[01:58:45] <Cork> that's fine as it is in a function
[01:58:51] <Cork> so you get a separate function for each loop
[02:00:10] <luaboy> Cork:does that lead it not work?
[02:01:04] <Cork> luaboy: it means that you will add the elements the revers of the number of elements you have
[02:01:20] <Cork> ex. if you have 5 elements, the first gets added 5 times, the second 4 times...
[02:01:29] <Cork> and i don't think you want that
[02:07:52] <luaboy> Cork:yes
[02:08:24] <luaboy> Cork:if I execute the code in $(document).ready ,does it work as expected?
[02:08:29] <Cork> to be honest i'm no sure why you go the event route at all
[02:08:48] <Cork> luaboy: depends on when you run the code
[02:09:00] <Cork> but ya, most likely
[02:09:30] <luaboy> Cork:I need to show the data from json when the page is loaded
[02:09:53] <Cork> that you can't do, as the ajax call happens on page load
[02:09:59] <Cork> it will always be a delay there
[02:10:24] <luaboy> Cork:why the event handler is not executed?
[02:10:40] <Cork> i can't tell without seeing the code in action
[02:10:46] <luaboy> Cork:I have moved the code out of the each
[02:11:07] <Cork> the selector might be wrong, or it might be something with how the html is structured
[02:11:12] <Cork> i don't have enough info to say
[02:13:08] <compact> hi. I'm using data tables and colorbox. when i open colorbox, its like datable runs again and adds rows etc
[02:48:28] <Arba> Hi
[02:49:04] <runtyrobot> mjello
[02:49:18] <Arba> I would like to change the background color of all td's in a table that contain a certain string
[02:49:29] <Arba> and for that I use the jquery filter method
[02:49:54] <Arba> But in the end only the last string is actually highlighted
[02:50:13] <Arba> so of all the searched strings only the one that came last in the loop is actually highlighted
[02:50:27] <Cork> Arba: you use a filter function or filter string?
[02:50:56] <Arba> Cork, may I send you a code snippet in PM? I'm worried to be kicked out of the room if I paste 4 lines of code in the lobby
[02:51:24] <wizbit> I have a flash audio player in a jquery tab, however, when i select another tab the audio stops playing, when i go back to the flash audio player tab, audio starts playing again. Is there a way to make a flash audio player continue playing when different tabs are selected?
[02:51:25] <Arba> I'm using a function
[02:52:33] <Cork> ?paste @  Arba
[02:52:33] <b-ot> Arba: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:52:44] <Arba> ok, I sec
[02:52:50] <Cork> i don't want the code in my pm anyway :)
[02:53:21] <Cork> wizbit: are you using ajax loaded tab content or something like that?
[02:53:45] <Cork> cause that is basically the only way jquery could be the cause
[02:54:01] <Cork> else it would have to be the browser or the flash player
[02:54:09] <Cork> (and not much jquery can do about it)
[02:54:40] <wizbit> Cork: im using jplayer in a jquery tab to play a radio stream
[02:54:58] <wizbit> im thinking flash wont work if the tab is hidden
[02:54:59] <Cork> that didn't answer my question...
[02:55:05] <wizbit> not ajax no
[02:55:11] <wizbit> its embedded in the tab html
[02:55:29] <Cork> ok, then it is either the browser, jplayer or flash stopping the sound
[02:55:38] <wizbit> yep
[02:55:51] <Cork> for example it could be that it stops playing if the player is inside a display: none
[02:56:01] <Cork> and ya... not much jquery can do about that
[02:56:02] <wizbit> its something to do with flash, because if the audio is played using html5 the audio doesnt stop playing
[02:57:14] <wizbit> i might need to put jplayer outside the tab then position it, then write some code what moves the player with left: -9999px when another tab is selected
[02:57:20] <wizbit> that might work, a bit lame though
[02:57:34] <Cork> or there might be an option for jplayer
[02:57:54] <wizbit> yep ill take a look, flash works in different wmodes, like window, opaque etc
[02:58:09] <Cork> it isn't about vmodes
[02:58:23] <Cork> vmodes is just about the background of the flash element
[02:58:38] <wizbit> if display: none stops flash, then visibility: hidden might work
[02:58:55] <Cork> except that won't work cause elements take space with visibility: hidden
[02:59:01] <wizbit> eek ok
[02:59:41] <wizbit> i cant think of any way around it apart from putting the flash player outside the tabs then position and remove in relevant tabs
[02:59:59] <Cork> ya
[03:00:16] <Cork> you could play with it and put it inside a normal element and see if display: none is the cause
[03:00:21] <wizbit> i dont want to use flash fallback but some browsers need it
[03:00:21] <Cork> it was just a guess on my part
[03:00:32] <wizbit> yep good idea
[03:00:50] <Cork> wizbit: you mean you need ie < 10 support?
[03:01:01] <Cork> cause that is the only browsers on the market that needs flash
[03:01:08] <Arba> weird, while trying to adapt my code to make it work in jsfiddle, I fixed the problem. Cool channel, thx for your help! ;)
[03:01:21] <Cork> the rest support at least one native codec
[03:01:46] <Cork> Arba: ya, that is common, and why one should always start by making one
[03:01:54] <Cork> its how i often fix bugs before asking too :)
[03:02:19] <Cork> (not jsfiddle as it normally isn't about js, but same logic)
[03:02:22] <wizbit> Cork: my stream is mp3, firefox doesnt support mp3 without flash
[03:02:33] <Uhkis> at least youtubes player goes haywire if display: none'd
[03:03:29] <wizbit> Cork: http://jplayer.org/latest/developer-guide/  'How to disable jPlayer with CSS or jQuery'
[03:03:33] <wizbit> interesting :)
[03:03:46] <Cork> wizbit: so use opus and mp3
[03:03:54] <Cork> provide an additional stream
[03:04:01] <Cork> that is the clean solution :)
[03:04:03] <wizbit> interesting, what is opus?
[03:04:14] <Cork> the best audio codec on the market :)
[03:04:19] <Cork> ?g opus codec
[03:04:20] <wizbit> ace will check it out
[03:04:20] <b-ot> Cork: Opus Codec → http://www.opus-codec.org/
[03:04:39] <Cork> and opus works just fine in firefox
[03:04:51] <wizbit> excellent
[03:04:55] <Cork> it has built in codec for it (as it isn't under a patent)
[03:05:19] <Cork> mp3 and 26x can't as the patent makes that impossible
[03:08:43] <wizbit> Cork: i will do some research, thanks for your help :)
[03:15:02] <PCatinean> $('span.oe_currency_value').val() this returns a list with only one element and I cannot extract the value with val() or [0].val()
[03:15:15] <PCatinean> it just shows an empty string for the list and error on [0].val()
[03:16:54] <Cork> PCatinean: uh, .val on a span??
[03:17:04] <PCatinean> ah, text then?
[03:17:06] <Cork> ah, sotrable?
[03:17:20] <PCatinean> what do you mean sortable?
[03:17:23] <Cork> well.. .val is for grabbing "values" from form elements
[03:17:35] <Cork> i think it might be hooked into jquery ui sortable
[03:17:37] <Cork> but not sure
[03:18:03] <Cork> anyway i'm just trying to figure out what you're doing
[03:18:16] <PCatinean> no I needed to use text you are right, how do I do such that if I do parseFloat(selector.text()) doesn't break the execution
[03:18:30] <PCatinean> I need to determine if the text of an element is 0
[03:18:50] <Cork> PCatinean: note that .text will give you the text in the element, and all its children
[03:19:01] <Cork> it isn't just the text directly in the span
[03:19:12] <PCatinean> okay
[03:19:35] <Cork> anyway, you want an array or what?
[03:20:08] <PCatinean> I just want the price that is in side that span, parse itand if it's 0 disable a button near it
[03:20:26] <Cork> uh
[03:20:34] <Cork> PCatinean: could you create a jsfiddle?
[03:20:47] <Cork> i suspect the selector is your problem (with the last comment you made)
[03:21:48] <ilhami> Hey :P
[03:21:56] <ilhami> how easy is it to send some data with a post request?
[03:22:39] <Cork> ilhami: $.post(url, $('#form').serialize())
[03:23:10] <ilhami> that was easy. :P
[03:23:26] <ilhami> although I use the $.ajax way :P
[03:24:00] <Cork> ilhami: $.post is just a wrapper around $.ajax
[03:24:05] <Cork> it is just as simple
[03:24:16] <ilhami> yeah. Also I need to hmac the data before sending it. :P
[03:24:41] <ilhami> sensitive data.
[03:31:16] <lilsammy__> ahahaha
[03:31:18] <lilsammy__> ilhami
[03:31:29] <ilhami> what? :S
[03:31:39] <lilsammy__> wtf you doing on freenode you not on in #C# on quakenet?
[03:31:56] <ilhami> Quakenet is not a good network :/
[03:32:07] <lilsammy__> Better than freenode
[03:32:28] <ilhami> too much hate on Quakenet as far as I have seen.
[03:33:10] <lilsammy> Just for you I think
[03:45:32] <mooncup> am I right in thinking I can pass a function that retursn an object into $.post rather than an object of my post data?
[03:46:20] <ilhami> and lilsammy .. dont tell them I am here.
[03:53:47] <wizbit> Cork: just solved the problem by placing <div id="jquery_jplayer_1" class="jp-jplayer"></div> outside the tabs, it doesnt effect the player at all :D
[03:54:49] <Cork> mooncup: yes you can, that is what .serialize() is after all :)
[03:54:56] <Cork> wizbit: nice
[03:55:11] <mooncup> cheers
[03:57:31] <Arcarc> How should I replace the second line here?
[03:57:31] <Arcarc> $('#form input[type=text]').focus(function() {
[03:57:31] <Arcarc> 		if ($(this).hasClass("errorClass")) {
[03:58:33] <Arcarc> Presumably I'm not doing it correctly as it never returns true
[03:58:56] <xec> does the input ever actually have the class "errorClass"?
[03:59:26] <Cork> ?paste @ Arcarc
[03:59:26] <b-ot> Arcarc: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:59:50] <Arcarc> Thought two lines was underkill
[04:00:10] <Cork> include a bit more about what happens
[04:00:21] <Cork> and what you want to do
[04:00:23] <Arcarc> Also, I just realized that I'm dumb
[04:00:48] <Arcarc> It doesn't actually have the class errorClass (thanks xec)
[04:01:06] <Uhkis> yeah, that would cause it to never return true :D
[04:01:09] <Cork> Arcarc: btw you prob want to use $('#form').on('focus', 'input[type=text]', function() { })
[04:01:29] <xec> :D
[04:02:03] <Cork> lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfC_jZq2JEE
[04:02:12] <Arcarc> Had '$errorClass = "style= ...' in the PHP, forgot to change it to '$errorClass = "class= ...'
[04:02:23] <Arcarc> Cork: Why is that better?
[04:02:41] <Cork> Arcarc: it bind one event handler that handles all the input instead of one for each input field
[04:04:30] <Arcarc> Interesting
[04:32:47] <caioketo> Hey there, I got a canvas inside a dialog (jqueryui) how can I get the correct mouse position inside the canvas?
[04:33:19] <Cork> caioketo: .offset() should work
[04:33:38] <caioketo> ok, i will give it a shot, thanks
[04:33:45] <Cork> though i know some browsers has bugs in canvas positioning
[04:40:20] <caioketo> Cork: What about the scroll inside the dialog? i got it working with the offset, but if I scroll the dialog down, it dont change the offset, is there any function/variable to get that?
[04:40:57] <Cork> caioketo: the offset should be calculated including with the scroll
[04:41:26] <Cork> offset() should give you the position relative to the top left of the viewport
[04:42:04] <caioketo> Cork: But im saying the top, if I scroll down, and move the mouse, it will get like the top of the canvas, and not the position its inside the canvas now
[04:42:30] <Cork> caioketo: uh, ya?
[04:42:40] <Cork> canvas is the position of the element, not the mouse
[04:42:50] <caioketo> Cork: I got a list of sprites inside the canvas, inside the dialog
[04:43:02] <Cork> if you want the mouse related to the page just check pageX/pageY on mousemove
[04:43:28] <Cork> and if you later want the position related to the canvas you need to subtract the offset values
[04:43:29] <caioketo> if I max the height of the dialog, and move the mouse, it gets the right sprite, if I minimize the canvas, and scroll down, it gets wrong
[04:43:34] <caioketo> im doing like this:
[04:43:39] <Cork> yes i know
[04:43:40] <caioketo> y = e.pageY;
[04:43:44] <Cork> and i just told you why
[04:43:45] <caioketo>  y -= $("#dialog").offset().top;
[04:45:29] <caioketo> but I need to add the scroll value, so I can get it right
[04:45:35] <caioketo> the dialog scroll not the page one
[04:46:16] <decx> get clientY instead
[04:46:56] <decx> either way dont do lookups and something like offset() every mousemove
[04:47:27] <blinky_> Hi all, I am trying to get a confirmation box working for sending emails, this is what I have but it does nothing, any ideas? - http://pastie.org/10111483
[04:47:35] <caioketo> how should I get the offset without calling offset()?
[04:47:50] <decx> you dont have to get offset on mousemove
[04:48:00] <decx> just do it once
[04:48:14] <decx> or whenever it realistically can change
[04:49:24] <caioketo> if I move the dialog along the window, is there any callbacks to change the offset?
[04:50:08] <decx> check events in the api docs of dialog
[04:50:20] <decx> dragStop for example
[04:51:07] <caioketo> i got it, thanks, but still didnt figure out how to get the dialog scroll value
[04:51:58] <decx> like you would any other scroll value of an element i guess
[04:52:12] <decx> scrollTop() or scrollY
[04:57:16] <caioketo> decx: thanks man, it worked, scrollTop().
[04:57:39] <caioketo> decx: just one last question, is there a function afterScroll? so I dont get scrollTop() everymousemove
[04:58:26] <decx> set it on scroll then
[04:58:47] <decx> so offset on dragStop, scrollTop on scroll and only mouse position on mousemove
[05:00:39] <caioketo> decx: Thanks man, very thanks, u saved me a lot of time ^_^
[05:00:39] <Cork> caioketo: no there isn't an afterScroll
[05:00:46] <Cork> only way to get that would be a setTimeout
[05:01:19] <caioketo> I got it working like this: dialogWindow.on("scroll", function (event, ui) {         dialogScroll = dialogWindow.scrollTop();     });
[05:01:56] <caioketo> after the scroll it calls my callback fine
[05:34:46] <jimmystewart> why does this work here:  http://jsfiddle.net/3J8vW/1/    -works perfectly....but then going to share full screen. to see the entirity of it, it does not work: https://jsfiddle.net/3J8vW/1/embedded/result/
[05:36:28] <dANO> hi
[05:36:52] <dANO> I would like to add a text field where the user will enter a number of hours and I'll show him the corresponding price. I would like the text fields can accommodate only numbers and no text, no number to decimal or negative number. How can I do that?
[05:39:11] <Cork> dANO: normally restricting the allowed input values gives a... less then optimal experience
[05:39:35] <Cork> it's normally better to show a "validation" error when the invalid value is entered
[05:40:02] <Cork> dANO: it is possible to do though, just bind an input event and remove the none allowed values (this will affect cursor position though)
[05:40:18] <ilhami> Cork, :-D were you the guy helping me one time?
[05:40:57] <dANO> Cork: you suggest , I hide the price if the input contains ( '-',',', '.' or letters ) ?
[05:40:58] <Cork> $('#input').on('input', function() { $(this).val($(this).val().replace(/[^0-9]/g, '')); });
[05:41:07] <jimmystewart> is this working for anyone: http://jsfiddle.net/3J8vW/1/
[05:41:34] <Cork> dANO: or replace it with a "entered <text> must be a number"
[05:41:37] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:41:42] <Cork> O_o
[05:41:49] <dANO> jimmystewart: yes
[05:41:55] <Cork> b-ot: are you high?
[05:41:55] <b-ot> Cork: without a doubt.
[05:41:58] <Cork> ok
[05:42:03] <jimmystewart> and is this working? : https://jsfiddle.net/3J8vW/1/embedded/result/
[05:42:26] <dANO> jimmystewart: no :D
[05:42:42] <jimmystewart> why would it not work, its just the full screen link from fiddle
[05:43:52] <Cork> jimmystewart: they have basically broken the none editor view of jsfiddle
[05:44:02] <Cork> use another online editor if you need that
[05:44:40] <jimmystewart> they basically broken the none editor view ? what does that mean
[05:44:58] <Cork> it means if you need to see the result without the editor wrapping, don't use jsfiddle
[05:45:07] <Cork> cause those views are broken now days
[05:45:18] <Cork> as in, they don't render what you expect
[05:46:38] <jimmystewart> why is Jsfiddle number 1 go to from everyone including this channel if it apparently doesnt work
[05:47:21] <Cork> jimmystewart: it is a good tool for helping with a snippet of code
[05:47:31] <Cork> it is also a good tool for helping cleaning up code
[05:47:43] <Cork> and historically very good for testing solutions
[05:47:46] <Cork> not so much now days
[06:02:11] <crillegustafsson> hi.. how to stop jquery to go below ZERO/NULL ?? ---> http://jsfiddle.net/cL7bm36p/
[06:03:06] <crillegustafsson> have tried add min="1" to input
[06:03:12] <crillegustafsson> but jquery override it
[06:03:36] <crillegustafsson> is there any jquery code to stop input go below 0 ?
[06:06:06] <Cork> crillegustafsson: http://jsfiddle.net/cL7bm36p/2/
[06:06:45] <decx> the actual attribute is min for input type number not min-value
[06:06:58] <ilhami> hey.
[06:07:03] <ilhami> Anyone who has experience with Lumen?
[06:08:22] <crillegustafsson> Cork.. it seems to work.. but it Can goes to -1
[06:08:27] <crillegustafsson> it should stop at 0
[06:08:32] <crillegustafsson> or 1
[06:09:11] <crillegustafsson> Cork fixed it =)
[06:09:13] <crillegustafsson> thx
[06:09:28] <decx> min-value is still not a valid attribute
[06:09:31] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/cL7bm36p/3/
[06:09:37] <Cork> ya
[06:10:44] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/cL7bm36p/4/
[06:11:01] <Cork> ^ fixed the id vs class problem too
[06:11:58] <crillegustafsson> thx =)
[06:12:55] <decx> the spinwheel on that type is so ugly
[06:13:25] <Cork> decx: the look is browser dependent
[06:13:35] <decx> i know and it never looks any good ^^
[06:14:02] <Cork> decx: in what browser?
[06:14:08] <Cork> the different browsers look quite different
[06:14:34] <decx> well i guess chrome now only shows it when you hover
[06:14:38] <decx> ff still looks terrible
[06:14:48] <decx> i dont know about mobile, could be good
[06:15:19] <Cork> heh i actually prefer ff's design there >_>
[06:15:33] <decx> it's too damn small
[06:15:38] <Cork> but ya, i pref firefox native feel a lot better
[06:15:41] <Cork> small?
[06:15:48] <decx> the up down buttons
[06:15:55] <Cork> time for a screenshot i think
[06:16:20] <Cork> cause they sure aren't small here
[06:16:52] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/4BSzhNS.png
[06:17:11] <Cork> ouch ya...
[06:17:26] <Cork> that doesn't look good, i agree
[06:17:31] <Cork> http://i.imgur.com/PDXAtDb.png
[06:18:30] <decx> my type custom type number http://i.imgur.com/anNPz7B.png
[06:19:06] <Cork> it loses the native input field look though, for good and bad...
[06:19:42] <Cork> (i'm not a fan if the "modern" everything should be extremely flat design though)
[06:20:21] <Kingsy> if I have a rel attribute that contains this --> useZoom: 'zoom1', smallImage: 'http://domain.com/media/import/images/x/image.jpg' <-- how would I get smallImage only?
[06:20:30] <Kingsy> so h"ttp://domain.com/media/import/images/x/image.jpg"
[06:20:42] <Kingsy> oops.. " in the wrong place but you get the idea.
[06:20:46] <Cork> Kingsy: you really, REALLY shouldn't use rel for that
[06:20:56] <Kingsy> Cork: yeah I know :(
[06:21:01] <Kingsy> It was a plugin that does it
[06:21:04] <Cork> use data-small="" and data-zoom=""
[06:21:09] <decx> probably some obscure lightbox implementation
[06:21:11] <Kingsy> we are looking to move away from it
[06:21:13] <Kingsy> yep
[06:21:20] <Cork> uh...
[06:21:27] <Cork> man so much junk out there >_>
[06:21:29] <Kingsy> but for right now.. I need to get a work around on this.
[06:21:39] <Cork> ok, you could do .split(', ') i guess
[06:21:40] <jimmystewart> I am trying to get this to work "http://responsiveslides.com/with-captions/themes.html"  i have uploaded that to www.603pc.com/slider/index                         .................I am having 2 issues with this. #1 it does not autofade...#2 the arrows to go to next slide do not show up. please help.
[06:21:51] <Kingsy> ah thats I good idea.
[06:22:03] <Cork> js> print("useZoom: 'zoom1', smallImage: 'http://domain.com/media/import/images/x/image.jpg'".split(', ')[1])
[06:22:08] <b-ot> Cork: smallImage: 'http://domain.com/media/import/images/x/image.jpg'
[06:22:21] <Cork> another option could be to make it a valid json
[06:22:40] <Kingsy> I cant really do that either.. :( not right now.
[06:22:55] <Cork> js> print(JSON.parse('{' + "useZoom: 'zoom1', smallImage: 'http://domain.com/media/import/images/x/image.jpg'" + '}').smallImage)
[06:22:58] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[06:23:03] <Cork> hmm
[06:23:11] <Cork> ah, shit it isn't even almost valid json :/
[06:23:16] <Kingsy> I know
[06:23:22] <Kingsy> its a nightmare
[06:23:26] <Cork> js> print(JSON.parse('{' + "useZoom: 'zoom1', smallImage: 'http://domain.com/media/import/images/x/image.jpg'".replace("'", '"') + '}').smallImage)
[06:23:30] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[06:23:35] <Cork> hmm
[06:23:39] <Cork> :P
[06:23:45] <Cork> so ya, split it is i guess
[06:24:03] <Kingsy> Cork: after a split, how would I get the path only?
[06:24:11] <Cork> split again
[06:24:13] <decx> another split ^^
[06:24:15] <Cork> or regex
[06:24:36] <Kingsy> what a nightmare
[06:24:38] <Kingsy> but thanks
[06:24:48] <decx> that's why data-* is great
[06:24:59] <decx> it'll eat all the things
[06:25:05] <Cork> js> print(/smallImage: '([^']+)'/.match("useZoom: 'zoom1', smallImage: 'http://domain.com/media/import/images/x/image.jpg'")[1])
[06:25:09] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[06:25:37] <Cork> oh
[06:25:43] <Cork> js> print(/smallImage: '([^']+)'/.exec("useZoom: 'zoom1', smallImage: 'http://domain.com/media/import/images/x/image.jpg'")[1])
[06:25:48] <b-ot> Cork: http://domain.com/media/import/images/x/image.jpg
[06:25:52] <Kingsy> ah cool
[06:25:54] <Cork> that is prob the cleanest solution
[06:28:41] <decx> i'll argue that the cleanest solution would be getting rid of the plugin that uses the rel tag ;)
[06:28:51] <decx> who knows what else is going on there hehe
[06:28:57] <Cork> ya
[06:29:25] <Cork> but ya, abusing rel became common back in the "everyone write html like if it was xhtml" days
[06:29:53] <decx> good thing we have datasets now
[06:29:57] <Cork> as none standard attribute was invalid xhtml
[06:30:08] <Cork> ya, it's a much better solution
[06:30:35] <Cork> i wish the web got a solution for the global scope pinioning though
[06:30:50] <decx> who in the what now
[06:31:01] <Cork> like <a ... onclick="download()">
[06:31:18] <decx> we nearly got rid of it
[06:31:21] <Cork> "oh, sorry you can't name you're function download anymore cause that is now an attribute, and you will run that instead"
[06:31:28] <decx> then ng-everything
[06:31:54] <decx> oh right
[06:32:07] <decx> hey the download attribute is pretty sweet though
[06:32:12] <Cork> ^ that is taken from a bugzilla.mozilla.org bug :)
[06:32:28] <Cork> sure, and if you don't use event attributes it doesn't even conflict
[06:32:53] <Cork> but it still scares the hell out of me that attribute, names and ids becomes names defined in the global scope
[06:33:38] <decx> i hope it happens for all the globals that retargeting people want me to use :p
[06:33:41] <Cork> $('body').append('<a id="helloWorld"></a>'); helloWorld == AElement#helloWorld
[06:35:45] <Cork> $('body').append('<a id="helloWorld"></a>'); helloWorld == AElement#helloWorl

[06:36:45] <Kartagis> is it possible to define a function in success block of an xhr?
[06:36:52] <Cork> sure
[06:37:05] <Cork> it will only exist for that specific callback though
[06:40:10] <Kartagis> heh, how can I stop jsfiddle from executing what I used to have?
[06:40:20] <Kartagis> but don't have now
[06:40:22] <Cork> you used to have?
[06:40:29] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[06:40:51] <Kartagis> I deleted lines, but it kept them in cache
[06:41:19] <Cork> shouldn't be a problem as long as it is inline in the editor

[06:56:45] <Kartagis> (I need to make an alias for 's/ü//')
[06:56:54] <Kartagis> what was the problem?
[06:57:37] <Cork> Kartagis: you repeatedly tried to use "content" but it was never created
[06:57:51] <Cork> Kartagis: additionally you never sent node into the addNode
[06:58:02] <Kartagis> oh, okay
[06:58:02] <Cork> so it couldn't work with them
[07:00:03] <cuppy> Weird ... is anyone getting odd $this = $(this) misassignments, or know about them? I keep pouring over my code, and I can't find what's wrong.

[07:00:39] <Cork> Kartagis: a bit cleaner solution http://jsfiddle.net/eu83gqkb/19/
[07:01:00] <Cork> cuppy: make sure you define the variable
[07:01:10] <Cork> except for that it should be a name like any other
[07:01:36] <cuppy> Cork, sometimes, you astound me.
[07:01:45] <Cork> ?
[07:03:16] <cuppy> Cork, sometimes, I swear you've RDP'ed in, poured over my code, and then came back with the exact answer I need. Did you image I had a function within a function, or did you get lucky?
[07:04:03] <Cork> cuppy: just a hunch
[07:04:14] <cuppy> Cork, smh. You're the best.
[07:12:10] <jimmystewart> any ideas why slider is static {should be auto fade transitioning to next slide} when browser media query at max width 1150px? www.603pc.com
[07:25:04] <dan_j> Hi, Is anyone aware of a jquery plugin that can highlight an input box with a red ! symbol?
[07:25:18] <Wyclef> hey, how can i add another class to the following?
[07:25:20] <Wyclef> $(".play-thumbnail").click(function() {
[07:25:34] <Wyclef> i want play-thumbnail and play-button to both perform the same function
[07:25:46] <jimmystewart> at media query 1150px. Why is this slider not fading and just static? www.603pc.com
[07:25:48] <Cork> dan_j: you would have to do that as either a separate element, or as a background image
[07:25:55] <Cork> you can't have text color in an input field
[07:26:13] <Cork> Wyclef: comma separate them
[07:26:35] <Wyclef> inside the quotes? i tried "class", "other class"
[07:26:46] <Cork> inside ya
[07:28:06] <dan_j> Cork: something like this but that gives me the flexibility to choose the field that contains incorrect data. Not just a validator that checks for empty fields. http://www.jqueryrain.com/?4pqOhlMa
[07:29:42] <Cork> dan_j: ah, have a look at jquery.validator
[07:30:14] <Wyclef> cork: how come play-button doesn't work when i click it but play-thumbnail does   http://pastebin.com/wZ0VqdvF
[07:30:51] <Cork> cause the selector doesn't match?
[07:30:58] <Cork> hard to say without the html
[07:32:56] <Wyclef> cork: http://pastebin.com/Sk0Aam2q   the iframe is wrapped in the fluid-width-video-wrapper div

[07:41:46] <User900> hi
[07:41:49] <User900> is not possible to get a value from a php script ejecuted by ajax(jquery)?
[07:46:01] <Wyclef> can you have an on click on an empty div that just has a background image in it ?
[07:48:04] <randomguy1> non-jquery question.  anyone in here a .htaccess guru?
[07:48:21] <dan_j> If I want to scroll up to an input box, how do I work out the position to scroll to?
[07:54:05] <Wyclef> is cork still here?
[07:54:13] <Wyclef> i made a jsfiddle
[07:54:17] <Wyclef> https://jsfiddle.net/8v5nu9z8/
[07:54:31] <Wyclef> the red square is what i am having trouble with
[07:54:31] <randomguy1> dan_j: look at offset()
[07:54:52] <Wyclef> how come when you click the red square it doesn't do the same as clicking the thumbnail (play-thumbnail)
[07:54:57] <Wyclef> i dont understand
[07:55:10] <decx> red square and that image, *chuckle*
[07:55:22] <Wyclef> omg, sorry that was not intended
[07:56:13] <Wyclef> anyhow, how come when i click the square (play-button) it doesn't hide everything and start the video like when i click the thumbnail (play-thumbnail)
[07:57:12] <decx> this closest div for the div is itself
[07:57:17] <decx> closest starts at the source
[07:57:34] <decx> add a class in the parent and target that with closest
[07:57:39] <decx> or use parent or whatever
[07:57:44] <Wyclef> decx: i don't understand
[07:58:03] <decx> $(this).closest('div') when you click the image is the parent div
[07:58:13] <decx> when you click the div square it is itself
[07:58:23] <decx> and as such cant find all the other stuff
[07:58:59] <Wyclef> how do you think best to fix that?
[07:59:24] <decx> class on the parent
[07:59:39] <killtheliterate> anyone ever seen a jquery XHR that is a 404 with no response text? there's no log on the server of a 404 response, so trying to sleuth if my problem is in JS or somewhere else
[07:59:56] <Wyclef> there will be multiple of these on a page
[08:00:02] <Wyclef> i can't put a class on the parent
[08:00:07] <Wyclef> or they will all be triggered
[08:00:09] <decx> nope
[08:00:17] <decx> closest from that point is just the parent
[08:00:22] <decx> with a class
[08:00:51] <Wyclef> sorry for not getting this quickly, i'm new at this
[08:01:07] <Wyclef> you sound like gandalf and i am reading this like some riddle
[08:01:47] <decx> a closest is never too far, it's just as far as it wants to
[08:01:54] <Wyclef> omg, what?
[08:02:12] <decx> hey you throw around references then don't complain when i butcher quotes
[08:02:14] <decx> ^^
[08:02:20] <Wyclef> so basically, the script is not finding play button
[08:02:47] <Wyclef> don't i just remove closest div? for the play button and just do find play button?

[08:04:04] <Wyclef> huh, weird
[08:04:09] <decx> consider using youtube embed api too
[08:04:21] <Wyclef> i figured it would play them all at same time with class on parent
[08:04:35] <randomguy1> only one parent with that class to each of the buttons
[08:04:35] <Wyclef> youtube embed api i don't think does what i'm trying to do
[08:04:50] <Wyclef> i see
[08:05:03] <Wyclef> BRILLIANT
[08:05:10] <Wyclef> thx guys. jsfiddle is cool
[08:05:50] <Wyclef> how rad is it that the guy is climbing on the tanks hahaha
[08:05:59] <Wyclef> can u imagine?
[08:06:28] <randomguy1> i prefer my streets tank free
[08:07:19] <Wyclef> how does jsfiddle work? are fiddles private? if i save fiddles does everyone see them?
[08:07:45] <decx> they are never private
[08:07:52] <randomguy1> public for the most part so long as you know the link
[08:07:55] <decx> but also not indexed
[08:08:02] <decx> unless you add a title to the root
[08:08:08] <decx> then they appear in your profile
[08:08:09] <Wyclef> but like paste bin you can set them to be private and removed after a set time. jsfiddle is permanent?
[08:08:20] <decx> with an account you can delete them
[08:08:43] <amikrop> Hi. I have a 2nd button in the form which is handled like $('form').attr('action', 'save.php'); $('form').trigger('submit', true); but in save.php $_POST is empty. Why?
[08:08:46] <Wyclef> is that paid account?
[08:08:50] <Wyclef> i love paste bin
[08:08:53] <decx> it's free https://jsfiddle.net/user/decx/fiddles/
[08:09:08] <Wyclef> Cool!
[08:09:16] <amikrop> I change the action of the form and I trigger submit with an extra parameter. But $_POST is empty
[08:09:30] <randomguy1> does your form have a method="POST" on it?
[08:09:39] <randomguy1> if i'm remembering my raw html
[08:09:44] <amikrop> randomguy1: ofc. $_POST is not empty on "normal" submit
[08:10:15] <Wyclef> thanks decx!
[08:10:31] <Wyclef> sometimes it takes another pair of eye bales
[08:10:34] <randomguy1> dunno if it makes a difference, but try $('form').submit()
[08:11:26] <amikrop> never mind, I was not selecting it properly
[08:15:13] <randomguy1> killtheliterate: i've returned 404's from php before without content.  i simply set the header.  no content required
[08:15:41] <randomguy1> killtheliterate: and since the php did it, wouldn't necessarily show up in logs unless i made it do so
[08:15:44] <killtheliterate> randomguy1 right on. presumably, you would have a log message on the server that a 404 occurred, right?
[08:16:16] <randomguy1> killtheliterate: not necessarily, you'd need to do something like error_log( 'blah' ) for it to show, provided you have that logging enabled.
[08:16:57] <randomguy1> as far as the server is concerned it resolved the request perfectly
[08:17:24] <killtheliterate> my scenario is such that the back-end is certain that they would have a log if a 404 occurred... it's as though the request is never reaching the server, but it's readyState is 4, so it's getting somewhere
[08:19:43] <randomguy1> killtheliterate: if you know which file it should be handled by, you could turn on the error logs temporarily with http://jsfiddle.net/gv13pjab/
[08:20:00] <randomguy1> killtheliterate: changing the log file to whatever
[08:21:21] <killtheliterate> it's a Play application via HAproxy... somewhere, something should log the 404 response, so it's making me think there's some weird intermittent  DNS issue
[08:21:50] <randomguy1> ah, dunno anything about those really. :(
[08:25:04] <killtheliterate> yea, makes me feel like i'm in the twilight zone
[08:28:05] <caioketo> How can I resize the dialog window via javascript?
[08:28:25] <randomguy1> but as far as your original question.  you could try duplicating the request in something like CRest or some whatever rest client to see if you still get the 404.  that would rule out the js
[08:28:55] <randomguy1> i think CRest is Chrome and just RESTful for firefox
[08:30:04] <randomguy1> caioketo: what do you mean "dialog window"?
[08:30:46] <caioketo> jquery ui dialog widget
[08:30:55] <caioketo> it opens in the w and h of the content?
[08:31:03] <caioketo> if I resize the content will it be resized?
[08:31:37] <decx> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-resizable
[08:32:11] <caioketo> thanks, got it working
[10:04:31] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[10:06:07] <Livecodingtv_Muh> HI all
[10:06:18] <Livecodingtv_Muh> how is it going ?
[10:07:24] <robertmaxrees> not too bad.  How are you, Livecodingtv_Muh
[10:08:24] <Livecodingtv_Muh> <robertmaxrees> am good :)
[10:21:47] <mathu> i'm looking at some code that uses the validation plugin. i have this line of code `$('#id').rules("add", {timesNotEqual: true, messages: {...}});` and i can't find docs on timesNotEqual
[10:22:37] <mathu> there are two time fields, and this is SUPPOSED to keep the end time from being before the start time
[10:22:41] <robertmaxrees> that's adding a timesNotEqual rule.
[10:22:50] <robertmaxrees> so you're not going to see any docs for it.
[10:23:22] <mathu> what actually happens is that the end time is accepted if it is <= 1.5 hours after the start time
[10:23:28] <mathu> robertmaxrees: why would that mean there aren't docs for it?
[10:23:44] <mathu> i see that it's adding a timesNotEqual rule. i want to know exactly what that entails, and how it works
[10:23:44] <robertmaxrees> because it's not apart of the core validation library.
[10:23:47] <mathu> ah
[10:23:49] <robertmaxrees> it's a custom added rule.
[10:23:57] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:24:08] <mathu> oh oh oh, i see it in another file
[10:24:12] <mathu> awesome. thank you robertmaxrees
[10:24:43] <robertmaxrees> deffo - i just got done working with jquery validate again so i know how confusing it can be.
[11:21:57] <ph88> is there any smarter jquery way to write this?    row = $($(e.target).parents('.exercise')[0]);
[11:22:16] <robertmaxrees> $(e.target).closest('.exercise')
[11:22:42] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, use .eq() when you want to grab something by index.
[11:30:00] <ph88> thanks
[11:31:24] <renlo> how do you iterate over a selection of jquery elements?
[11:31:42] <arthurvr> !api each @ renlo
[11:31:43] <b-ot> renlo: .each(): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.  http://api.jquery.com/each/
[11:31:52] <renlo> $('.some-class').each(function(el) { /* el is the index not the el */ })
[11:32:17] <arthurvr> renlo: check the api docs for the correct usage
[11:32:27] <arthurvr> use $(this) for the element
[11:32:41] <decx> the element is the second argument
[11:32:52] <arthurvr> if you prefer it as an argument, yup
[11:33:02] <renlo> ah
[11:33:09] <renlo> was about to use Array.prototype.foreach lol
[11:33:20] <decx> depending on what you do you dont even need each as most methods have one built in
[11:34:06] <arthurvr> renlo: what decx said. Was there a strong reason to use Array#forEach. It’s possible if you really want to
[11:34:31] <renlo> yea, Array.prototype.forEach.call( jquerySelection, function(el) { ... })
[11:34:47] <arthurvr> wel that would work
[11:34:49] <renlo> but $(this) works well enough
[11:34:56] <renlo> thanks guys
[11:34:56] <arthurvr> yup =)
[11:35:03] <arthurvr> you’re welcome :p
[11:36:04] <randomguy1> was that an intended pun?
[11:36:22] <renlo> no haha
[11:36:39] <arthurvr> lol
[11:36:46] <randomguy1> cause $(that) never works
[11:37:23] <arthurvr> haha
[11:40:18] <randomguy1> i was quite happy earlier.  i finally found out how to make .htaccess rewrite a url to a php file.  now i'm one step closer to a cleaner php rest router, >:) bwahahaha
[11:41:19] <randomguy1> but now i'm stuck trolling stackoverflow...
[11:43:54] <unnu> having some selector troubles . . . http://jsfiddle.net/kgz1zuj4/1/   how does one grab the text in the preceding label?
[11:44:55] <unnu> was trying to store it to var time
[11:54:06] <unnu> any takers?
[12:09:12] <randomguy1> unnu i don't believe .dateTime is a child element of your parent
[12:09:36] <cj> is there an easy way to shallow-compare two objects?
[12:09:59] <cj> I could make sure the key count matches and then iterate through the keys comparing values in both objects
[12:10:23] <cj> but I'm hoping there's a utility that does that for me
[12:10:26] <randomguy1> cj maybe convert them to strings and compate those?
[12:10:40] <cj> randomguy1: key order matters when doing that
[12:11:18] <cj> ie, { a: 1, b: 2 } != { b: 2, a: 1 }, though in my use case, they are equal
[12:11:46] <randomguy1> true
[12:12:11] <cj> I guess I'll do the Object.keys( ... ) approach
[12:12:39] <randomguy1> or foreach (var key in object) {}
[12:13:34] <notchris> Can :eq() accept ranges?
[12:14:27] <BillCriswell> notchris: You can do that with slice.
[12:14:40] <Sal> hi i have some event handling functions that have the event as argument
[12:14:47] <notchris> Hmmm
[12:14:50] <Sal> how can i call these functions directly?
[12:15:10] <Sal> should i creat an empty event and pass it when calling?
[12:15:16] <NoiseEee> what do you mean
[12:15:28] <NoiseEee> just call the function the handler refers to directly
[12:15:40] <randomguy1> Sal you could use trigger()
[12:16:28] <Sal> the function is function loadImage(e) { e.preventDefault; ... }
[12:16:48] <Sal> if i call it with out passign an event object, i get error on the first line
[12:16:57] <randomguy1> trigger will supply an event
[12:17:20] <NoiseEee> or check for e being undefined
[12:17:27] <Sal> but, doesn't trigger require an element that fires the event?
[12:17:29] <randomguy1> or something like loadImage($.Event())
[12:17:33] <NoiseEee> personally im not a fan of trigger()
[12:18:34] <Sal> randomguy1, what does that do? it passes an empty event object?
[12:21:08] <Sal> ok, got it thanks
[12:21:44] <randomguy1> Sal yeah, though it may require some input to the function for the event your creating
[12:21:56] <randomguy1> NoiseEee don't be hatin, ;)
[12:30:18] <rhizome> am i right that the difference between $('a.edit').on(click: myHandler) and $(document).on('click', 'a.edit', myHandler) is that the first one doesn't work if a.edit is supplied by ajax-loaded content, i.e. after page load?
[12:31:16] <randomguy1> true, it would not be bound to the new item from an ajax request by default
[12:31:27] <randomguy1> unless you used the delegate version
[12:31:49] <rhizome> cool. what's the delegate version? :)
[12:31:54] <randomguy1> that's the second version
[12:32:09] <rhizome> gotcha, thanks
[12:32:20] <randomguy1> however, consider binding closer to the elements rather than the high level document object
[12:33:07] <rhizome> would "closer" be "some element that *is* present on page load?
[12:33:35] <rhizome> a containing element, that is
[12:33:41] <randomguy1> closer as in the lowest level dom element that will encompase all those
[12:34:10] <randomguy1> such as if your event was on tds, you might want to bind on the table
[12:36:55] <rhizome> right. this is in a qtip2 tooltip that creates its own div on the event, so even 'body' would be closer than 'document'?
[12:37:10] <randomguy1> yep
[12:37:25] <randomguy1> though if that's the case it might not matter much
[12:38:04] <rhizome> right. this makes me wonder whether 'document' is only really useful for a subset of events
[12:38:14] <rhizome> if any, in my present case
[12:38:43] <rhizome> i guess that question is a vague "why *wouldn't* i do a global replace"
[12:39:17] <randomguy1> two reasons i can think of is 1 it has to evaluate wheither or not it needs to use that callback for every click event
[12:39:33] <randomguy1> which if you only need it for a subsection isn't necessary
[12:39:46] <randomguy1> and 2, if you want to cancel the bubbling of an event, by the time it reaches document, it's too late
[12:40:27] <randomguy1> others may correct me, or have other reasons
[12:40:37] <rhizome> in the delegated case, isn't document the endpoint of bubbling, or do i understand it wrong? i don't use it.
[12:40:48] <rhizome> a.edit being the starting point
[12:41:07] <randomguy1> yes and no
[12:41:22] <randomguy1> it's the end of the bubbling because nothing is above document (save for window I suppose)
[12:42:06] <randomguy1> bubbling does not end until it reaches the top or you cancel it
[12:42:44] <rhizome> yeah, my understanding is that document is the top, so i guess i understand that part
[12:42:55] <rhizome> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12824549/should-all-jquery-events-be-bound-to-document
[12:43:16] <rhizome> reading that it seems that the only things that should be bound to document are ones that are dynamically added?
[12:43:31] <randomguy1> anything you can't do otherwise, would be my advice
[12:43:40] <randomguy1> and if you can change it so you can do it other wise, all the better
[12:44:13] <rhizome> that makes sense, thanks.
[12:51:45] <guillaume-rb> hi i’ve got some difficulties with strong parameters. I have my params who look like this:
[12:51:52] <guillaume-rb> "tournament"=>{"name"=>"test", "phases"=>[{"third_place_match"=>"on"}]}
[12:52:09] <guillaume-rb> so i use this rule: params.require(:tournament).permit(:name, phases: [{:third_place_match}])
[12:52:33] <guillaume-rb> but a synthax error come with : syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end
[12:54:05] <guillaume-rb> someone could help me to understand why I have this error, I modifies in every sense but I have an error or he keep saying me parameters phases not permited? thanks
[12:55:02] <guillaume-rb> bad channel sry -_-
[13:04:02] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[13:04:23] <anternat> hi
[13:04:34] <robertmaxrees> why hello!
[13:10:59] <BillCriswell> oh herro
[13:17:09] <Livecodingtv_Muh> hey guys
[13:17:28] <robertmaxrees> are girls allowed, too?
[13:17:40] <Livecodingtv_Muh> hahha
[13:18:00] <Livecodingtv_Muh> yeah
[13:18:04] <robertmaxrees> sweet
[13:18:06] <Livecodingtv_Muh> you can sy ;)
[13:18:52] <Livecodingtv_Muh> <robertmaxrees>: are you a developer ?
[13:19:00] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[13:19:04] <Livecodingtv_Muh> sweet
[13:19:10] <Livecodingtv_Muh> i am a learner ;)
[13:19:15] <Livecodingtv_Muh> new in coding
[13:19:18] <robertmaxrees> a sr. front end developer, to be exact.
[13:19:31] <Livecodingtv_Muh> Great
[13:19:41] <Livecodingtv_Muh> i have developed many website in Wordpress
[13:19:48] <robertmaxrees> sorry to hear.
[13:19:55] <Livecodingtv_Muh> but learning through psd to complete site
[13:20:19] <Livecodingtv_Muh> i also worked in bootstrap and it is interesting
[13:21:16] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap is unique.
[13:21:31] <Livecodingtv_Muh> yeah easiest way to get responsive sites
[13:21:49] <robertmaxrees> eh, i wouldn't say "easiest".  it certainly is one of the simpler ways, though.
[13:22:04] <Livecodingtv_Muh> ah okk..
[13:22:24] <Livecodingtv_Muh> what is the basic step to learn website development ?
[13:22:35] <Livecodingtv_Muh> i mean from where to start ?
[13:23:04] <robertmaxrees> you need to know a few basics.  HTML, CSS, JS, some backend language, and basics of server management.
[13:23:11] <arthurvr> there’s no ‘right way’ I guess.
[13:23:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there's a set of skills you need to have, but there's not really a right order or anything.
[13:23:42] <arthurvr> wouldn’t say backend is a requirement but make sure you at least did a quick hello world lol
[13:23:58] <Livecodingtv_Muh> lol
[13:24:05] <arthurvr> yeah exactly all depends on what you’d like and what you’re planning to do
[13:24:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd argue knowing a backend inasmuch as a templating language at least is nice.
[13:24:31] <robertmaxrees> it only makes you a stronger developer.
[13:24:40] <arthurvr> once again, depends, but it’s a valuable skill for sure
[13:24:43] <Livecodingtv_Muh> yeah i think knowledge of backend is also necessory
[13:25:02] <Livecodingtv_Muh> is there any source where i can learn basics
[13:25:09] <arthurvr> plus hey hey you know javascript so you know a backend
[13:25:13] <Livecodingtv_Muh> i have worked on codeacademy
[13:25:15] <robertmaxrees> arthurvr pretty much :)
[13:25:26] <arthurvr> Livecodingtv_Muh: depends where you are right know ya know
[13:25:44] <arthurvr> I always suggest to just build stuff but some people don’t really like that
[13:26:03] <arthurvr> http://justbuildwebsites.com/
[13:26:17] <Livecodingtv_Muh> let me check
[13:28:01] <Livecodingtv_Muh> the main thing in learning "Enjoy the journey"
[13:28:28] <arthurvr> yeah the thing is that you should just think about what you’re going to build, start it, check what you need and go explore that stuff
[13:28:47] <Livecodingtv_Muh> :)
[13:30:44] <arthurvr> Livecodingtv_Muh: my general recommendation to people new in the scene is to just learn the basics, pick up some kind of framework and get started but you may totally not enjoy that road as well
[13:30:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't be afraid to experiment.
[13:31:52] <arthurvr> yup
[13:32:24] <arthurvr> go read existing source code and think about it is something I found valuable too
[13:32:33] <arthurvr> (of course make sure you pick up good code)
[13:32:51] <robertmaxrees> and be willing to be wrong.
[13:33:06] <arthurvr> yeah ^
[13:35:53] <Livecodingtv_Muh> yeah
[13:36:06] <moreirapontocom> The keyCode 13 is used for both ENTER keys?
[13:36:24] <Livecodingtv_Muh> some time it becomes hectic when you are strucked on 1 thing
[13:37:03] <arthurvr> Livecodingtv_Muh: then just come in here and ask us. Don’t be shy to ask is another important rule.
[13:37:10] <robertmaxrees> yesss
[13:37:25] <arthurvr> everybody needed to start somewhere
[13:37:38] <arthurvr> even the best programmers of this world ever started with a hello world
[13:38:17] <robertmaxrees> moreirapontocom i think so?
[13:38:32] <moreirapontocom> robertmaxrees: thank you
[13:38:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m1oq5cw5/ according to this, yes
[13:40:36] <Livecodingtv_Muh> thank you all :)
[13:40:45] <Livecodingtv_Muh> i will definatly ask you guys
[13:40:54] <arthurvr> you’re welomce
[13:40:56] <Livecodingtv_Muh> it is an awesome place to learn and share
[13:40:59] <robertmaxrees> s'what we do.
[13:41:03] <arthurvr> and I can’t spell
[13:41:08] <moreirapontocom> robertmaxrees: great fiddle! it's working fine here
[13:41:11] <robertmaxrees> plus arthurvr is a BEAST and super smart.
[13:41:37] <arthurvr> haha robertmaxrees
[13:41:43] <arthurvr> thanks bro :D
[13:41:48] <arthurvr> you too lol
[14:00:08] <lilalinux> Can I disable SOP?
[14:00:24] <NoiseEee> only if you control the destination server
[14:00:40] <lilalinux> Can I suppress the OPTIONS request?
[14:00:57] <lilalinux> I can do a PUT with curl, but not with jquery in the browser
[14:01:13] <lilalinux> because the browser does an OPTIONS reuquest
[14:01:44] <lilalinux> The problem: The server sends an Allow: header instead of Access-Control-Allow-Methods
[14:16:28] <fructose_> Hi. I'm trying to debug a page where clicking a link causes a logout via what appears to be an attached jQuery event. Is there a way to figure out where that event is being added? Stepping through the jquery in the debugger seems pretty fruitless.
[15:09:51] <targetron> When you bind to a class
[15:10:01] <targetron> And then you dynamically create a new element with that class
[15:10:06] <targetron> Does the new element get the binding?
[15:10:06] <robertTraining> not going to work.
[15:10:11] <robertTraining> nope.
[15:10:16] <targetron> What’s the correct way of doing it?
[15:10:23] <robertmaxrees> event delegation
[15:10:36] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[15:11:00] <robertmaxrees> instead of $('target').on('event', function() {});, it's now $('parent').on('event
[15:11:11] <robertmaxrees> *$('parent').on('event', 'target', function() {});
[15:13:14] <targetron> Oh hey, that actually works!
[15:13:15] <targetron> thanks!
[15:14:01] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[15:17:42] <targetron> how do I access the element that’s being changed ?
[15:17:56] <targetron> $('#mainContainer').on('input', '.gradeinput', function(e) {
[15:17:56] <targetron>         alert($(this).text());
[15:17:57] <targetron>     });
[15:18:01] <targetron> It just display something empty
[15:18:34] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste into the channel btw.
[15:18:54] <robertmaxrees> and $(this) is the element you changed.  alerting that doesn't make much sense.  do you want the value?
[15:19:30] <targetron> but I alerted the text() value
[15:19:33] <targetron> Yes I want the value
[15:19:36] <robertmaxrees> you want the .val()
[15:19:42] <targetron> o
[15:19:51] <targetron> awww yis thanks
[15:23:07] <Nasp> Use main for your container
[15:28:34] <targetron> Is there a way to select div whose id contains a string?
[15:28:38] <targetron> Or that starts with a string?
[15:28:52] <robertmaxrees> that's not a good use for an ID.
[15:28:56] <robertmaxrees> it's possible, but slow.
[15:29:07] <robertmaxrees> use a class instead if you cna.
[15:29:17] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't require a partial selector, I mean.
[15:29:45] <targetron> can I select by name?
[15:29:51] <targetron> name="hello"
[15:29:54] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty slow, too.
[15:30:03] <robertmaxrees> attribute selectors should be avoided when possible.
[15:30:22] <renlo> theres a way to select for names / whatever that start with something
[15:30:24] <renlo> ids too
[15:30:25] <renlo> pretty sure
[15:30:29] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:30:34] <robertmaxrees> it's possible.  i'm saying to avoid it.
[15:30:42] <robertmaxrees> if you have a bunch of elements that share an ID pattern of some kind, you should generally give them all a class to represent them if you need to select them.
[15:30:54] <renlo> el[id^=somestr]
[15:31:03] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* right, please avoid doing that.
[15:31:06] <renlo> el[id^="somestr"]
[15:31:09] <renlo> :)
[15:31:23] <robertmaxrees> those are called "attribute selectors" - you really want to avoid them.
[15:31:59] <Nasp> Data- is nice
[15:32:01] <renlo> its probably not *that* bad, depends on how you use them
[15:32:14] <robertmaxrees> data attributes are bad for selecting as well.
[15:32:25] <robertmaxrees> and sure, it's not the end of the world, but the path to hell and all that :)
[15:32:57] <renlo> http://benfrain.com/css-performance-revisited-selectors-bloat-expensive-styles/
[15:33:09] <robertmaxrees> that's great for CSS>
[15:33:14] <robertmaxrees> that's not applicable for jQuery selectors.
[15:33:20] <Nasp> robertmaxrees: why that
[15:33:41] <robertmaxrees> because they're meant for storing data. ID's and Classes are meant for selecting.
[15:34:04] <robertmaxrees> they're optimized for it - the browser (and sizzle, as a result) use particular APIs to keep those nice and fast.
[15:34:31] <Nasp> Data dash  are ment for selecting  as well
[15:34:36] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:34:43] <robertmaxrees> not with jquery at least.
[15:34:49] <Nasp> And if they are slow there is something wrong with the implementation
[15:34:51] <robertmaxrees> just because you CAN doesn't mean that's what they're there for.
[15:35:12] <Nasp> I prefer it over classes
[15:35:21] <renlo> thats slow
[15:35:23] <robertmaxrees> with css there's a minimal perfomance impact.
[15:35:32] <robertmaxrees> with javascript there is a real performance impact.
[15:37:05] <robertmaxrees> and while i generally agree with the sentiment of "don't prematurely optimize", this is one of those cases where somebody comes in well after the fact and has to re-write a whole bunch of stuff because they're have core performance problems surrounding selectors.
[15:37:16] <renlo> isnt all of it linear ( O(n) ) ?
[15:37:19] <renlo> regardless of anything
[15:37:39] <robertmaxrees> it depends on a lot of factors you can't control :)
[15:37:43] <renlo> like, isnt a selector a class just as slow as for some specific data attribute, or whatever
[15:37:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:38:29] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you're referring to.  in js, ID selectors, class selectors, then attribute selectors.  that's the rough order of speed.
[15:38:39] <renlo> I'm saying, document.querySelector('.foo') has to iterate through every node, does it not?
[15:39:23] <robertmaxrees> 1. browsers generally recognize you're doing a class lookup and use their optimized lookup for those.
[15:39:44] <renlo> where can I read up about that?
[15:39:46] <robertmaxrees> 2. that's not what jquery uses all the time.
[15:39:56] <renlo> my google queries aren't turning up with anything
[15:40:12] <robertmaxrees> i can direct you to the reading material about jquery selector performance.
[15:40:27] <renlo> hmm, more curious about vanilla JS
[15:40:30] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember what it was, but i've reead a few articles about javascript selector performance.
[15:41:12] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/15046461/923919
[15:41:21] <robertmaxrees> brb
[15:41:24] <renlo> in terms of jquery:
[15:41:25] <renlo> http://jsperf.com/id-vs-class-vs-tag-selectors/2
[15:41:34] <renlo> so yea, attribute selectors are horrible
[15:43:21] <Nasp> They are just nice  for js actions
[15:43:36] <Nasp> Data-action do something
[15:44:44] <robertmaxrees> that's a terrible idea imo.
[15:44:49] <robertmaxrees> that's like using inline onclick handlers.
[15:45:38] <Nasp>  That  test looks fine to me
[15:47:27] <renlo> which test?
[15:47:59] <Nasp> Just took a newer version
[15:48:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:48:45] <robertmaxrees> also: https://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/ is a good quick primer about selector performance in jquery for those who are interested.
[21:26:50] <iaj> Hi there :)
[21:27:18] <iaj> I''ve got a question, for speed issues of a website, its recommend to only have one docready specified on a page, is that correct? Or won't that matter much?
[21:28:11] <rcyr> It doesn't matter but in the best case... you wouldn't have any and all your JS files would be loaded just before the </body>
[21:29:38] <iaj> I don't need docready at all?
[21:30:14] <iaj> If I want to act on elements on a page like on 'h1'... I would need to wait until the h1 are actually there, no?
[21:30:47] <rcyr> iaj: Yes, of course.
[21:31:20] <rcyr> If your scripts are loaded just before the </body> at the end of the document, do you think your H1 is loaded when it gets there?
[21:31:57] <iaj> Well, it could be yeah :D
[21:32:01] <iaj> I got it now
[21:32:07] <iaj> Awesome thanks :D
[21:32:21] <iaj> For typo3 users that means page.includeJSFooter is the way to go here =)
[21:32:53] <rcyr> I never used that framework... when I use PHP, I pick Laravel
[21:33:13] <rcyr> Ah, Typo3 is a CMS
[21:33:17] <rcyr> nvm :)
[21:33:18] <iaj> there I can just do stuff like <script type<script type="text/javascript"> jQuery('h1').slideToggle(); </script>
[21:33:32] <iaj> omit the first <script type here :)
[21:33:37] <rcyr> Yeah... but you should use a file :)
[21:33:45] <iaj> How comes?
[21:34:09] <iaj> So best is to have a file jquery-actions.js and put that after the /body then
[21:34:17] <iaj> s/$/?
[21:34:32] <rcyr> iaj: It's just separation of concerns, it help maintainability if all the JS is in a .js file... and the html in a .html file(a html template file in your case)
[21:34:47] <rcyr> Not after, just before the </body>
[21:35:01] <beefkitten> iaj: also files allow browser caching, better performance
[21:35:58] <iaj> ahw.. ya makes sense... :)
[22:25:33] <gtwy> https://jsfiddle.net/gtwy/0fs2grqn/3/
[22:25:35] <gtwy> lol what am i doing wrong here
[22:25:50] <gtwy> its actually reloading the from even though im caling preventDefault();
[23:21:19] <Murilo> como conversamos aqui?
