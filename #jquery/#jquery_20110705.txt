[00:03:12] <lkeijser> hi, i have a table http://dpaste.com/563196/ (much longer, but you get the idea) and i want to use jquery to hide/fadeout one of the items (on one TR/line). Do i have to wrap a div around it or can i just do $("#order_id_NNN").fadeOut()  ?
[00:05:45] <BlankVerse> how to modif this to work inside a view function :-
[00:05:47] <BlankVerse> $('#content').tinymce().execCommand('mceInsertContent',false,window.Ebooks.models[0].chapters.models[2].get('content'));$
[00:06:07] <sm3k> hello guys. I'm facing a problem using jQuery (yea, I'm a noob). Could anyone here help me out?
[00:06:25] <BlankVerse> this doesnt work inside the function , but from console it works
[00:06:36] <BlankVerse> says tinymce undefiened
[00:06:41] <BlankVerse> scope problem?
[00:08:00] <sm3k> err not really
[00:08:27] <sm3k> I'm facing a very basic problem I've torn my hair out trying to solve
[00:08:52] <sm3k> I'm trying to use jquery in an asp .net application
[00:09:16] <sm3k> and chrome wont load the file for some reason
[00:09:39] <wkmanire> sm3k: Which framework of .Net are you using?
[00:09:41] <wkmanire> MVC or Forms?
[00:10:01] <sm3k> I'm using vs 2008
[00:10:07] <jomofcw> Morning !
[00:10:08] <sm3k> so I'm guessing 3.0?
[00:10:13] <wkmanire> sm3k: Thats the ID not the framework.
[00:10:24] <wkmanire> Are you setting up routes views and controllers or are you setting up webforms?
[00:10:35] <wkmanire> IDE*
[00:11:07] <sm3k> just' webforms
[00:11:15] <wkmanire> So you are using .Net forms.
[00:11:27] <wkmanire> Are you using a masterpage?
[00:11:29] <sm3k> yes asp .net with C# code behind
[00:11:46] <sm3k> yea there just one page
[00:11:56] * wkmanire facepalms.
[00:12:13] <sm3k> sorry I'm kinda new so pls bear with me :P
[00:12:35] <wkmanire> So no you aren't, pastebin the section where you include jQuery
[00:12:55] <sm3k> when i include jquery in an html file chrome has no problem loading jquery
[00:13:05] <sm3k> but it refuses to work in an aspx file
[00:13:20] <wkmanire> All browsers read javascript references the same.
[00:13:30] <wkmanire> Pastebin your whole ASPX page.
[00:14:02] <sm3k> I apologise but I dunno what that means
[00:14:40] <wkmanire> Open the page in visual studio
[00:14:49] <wkmanire> Choose the code view
[00:14:51] <wkmanire> not the design view
[00:14:55] <sm3k> done
[00:15:00] <wkmanire> Select all of the text
[00:15:03] <wkmanire> paste it into pastebin.
[00:15:31] <sm3k> where is pastebin?
[00:15:37] <wkmanire> http://www.pastebin.cmo
[00:15:39] <wkmanire> com*
[00:15:48] <sm3k> oh ok
[00:15:52] <sm3k> just gimme a sec
[00:15:55] <wkmanire> ok
[00:17:42] <shkiper> —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –µ—Å—Ç—å?
[00:18:33] <sm3k> http://pastebin.com/Pwmcm1Cv
[00:18:39] <sm3k> here it is
[00:18:54] <sm3k> but it's only the script tags that is causing the problem
[00:19:08] <sm3k> with the src attribute
[00:19:30] <sm3k> the rest are ok
[00:21:01] <wkmanire> sm3k: The problem is you are trying to use a local file path reference.
[00:21:09] <wkmanire> none of your script includes are ok.
[00:21:21] <wkmanire> those script tags are not being processed by the webserver.
[00:21:36] <wkmanire> they are just basic HTML and are getting pushed right out to the browser.
[00:21:45] <wkmanire> you need to use MapPath on them.
[00:21:52] <sm3k> hmm
[00:22:19] <sm3k> so how does it work?
[00:22:25] <wkmanire> src="<% MapPath("d:/sriram/Jqueryfiles.etc.etc") %>"
[00:22:27] <wkmanire> or some such.
[00:22:41] <wkmanire> It'd be better just to include jQuery in your solution
[00:22:47] <wkmanire> Or just use the jQuery CDN.
[00:22:56] <sm3k> as in within the script tags?
[00:23:01] <wkmanire> yes
[00:23:43] <sm3k> hmm wait lemme try out Map path first
[00:23:46] <sm3k> brb
[00:23:52] <wkmanire> sm3k: Before you do that
[00:23:55] <wkmanire> look it up in MSDN
[00:23:57] <wkmanire> understand what it does.
[00:24:06] <wkmanire> and where it is in the namespace heirarchy.
[00:24:20] <sm3k> sure
[00:24:28] * sm3k sets off to google
[00:24:29] <sm3k> brb
[00:27:33] <Hirmon> Hi
[00:28:35] <iameum> Hey mon
[00:33:01] <sm3k> hmm I'm getting a compilation error
[00:35:25] <sm3k> <script type="text/javascript" src="<%Server.MapPath("d:/sriram/jquery-1.6.1.min.js")%>" ></script> this is what the tag looks like now
[00:36:04] <sm3k> There was a similar method I tried earlier called ResolveUrl(path)
[00:36:14] <sm3k> but that too gave a compilation error
[00:36:17] <wkmanire> MapPath returns an absolute URL relative to a URL in your application.
[00:36:34] <wkmanire> ResolveURL returns an absolute virtual URL
[00:36:45] <wkmanire> using a tilde to denote the root path of your application.
[00:37:49] <wkmanire> So if my app was at c:\foo, and I had my javascript at c:\foo\javascript, Server.MapPath(ResolveURL("~/javascript")) would return c:\foo\javascript
[00:37:55] <wkmanire> I think you are working way to hard on this.
[00:37:55] <sm3k> hmm but what's the difference?
[00:38:07] <wkmanire> put jquery in your project in a directory called js.
[00:38:20] <wkmanire> Then just reference it with ResolveURL("~/js/jQuery.js")
[00:38:33] <wkmanire> of course correct the filename to use whatever version of jQuery you've downloaded.
[00:38:42] <wkmanire> too*
[00:39:15] <sm3k> in the same directory as my aspx file?
[00:39:18] <wkmanire> sure
[00:39:19] <wkmanire> you can do that
[00:40:12] <zhrance> good day everybody!
[00:40:25] <zhrance> I found a jquery IE9 bug :(
[00:40:41] <zhrance> although I blame IE9 but still...
[00:40:52] <sm3k> wkmanire: ok just a sec. I'm on it.
[00:41:24] <BlankVerse> if there are 2 scripts 1 and 2 and both have $(function()  , in which order is the code executed?
[00:41:38] <BlankVerse> in the other in which the script src is specified in htl?
[00:41:44] <zhrance> this page describes the IE9 bug perfecly http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/iewebdevelopment/thread/902aa3c2-51d1-4b29-9460-0bbddee14843
[00:43:06] <wkmanire> BlankVerse: In the order the files are included.
[00:43:19] <wkmanire> or more specifically, in the order which the $() functions are executed.
[00:43:41] <wkmanire> jQuery will will queue both functions to run, in the order they were queued, as soon as the DOM is deemed ready.
[00:44:54] <JKarsrud> sm3k: I hear something about .NET? I'm you man :D :P
[00:46:39] <sm3k> no luck. I'm still getting a compilation error when I use these methods
[00:47:21] <sm3k> JKarsund: thanks man Any help is welcome :)
[00:47:40] <wkmanire> JKarsrud: Thats good, because I'm out of beer.
[00:48:25] <sm3k> here's the tag now
[00:48:32] <sm3k> <script type="text/javascript" src="<%ResolveUrl("jquery-1.6.1.min.js")%>" ></script>
[00:48:37] <sm3k> what do you make of it?
[00:48:43] <cjflory> is there a trick to using "outerWidth()" to get the width of an element returned with ajax, and then appended to a page?
[00:48:51] <wkmanire> sm3k: Visual Studio is not a good web designer, its really just a good IDE. Unfortunately M$ really complicated things with .net Forms. To do something simple like include javascript in a dynamic page, you have to understand a 10 step code flow diagram.
[00:49:05] <wkmanire> so good luck.
[00:49:09] <wkmanire> and good night
[00:49:14] <JKarsrud> sm3k: is this mvc?
[00:49:27] <wkmanire> JKarsrud: He's using basic .Net Forms.
[00:49:27] <JKarsrud> or regular web forms?
[00:49:28] <sm3k> thanks wkmanire
[00:49:30] <JKarsrud> kk
[00:49:36] <sm3k> I really appreciate your help :)
[00:49:52] <wkmanire> he doesn't understand the difference between server URLs and Virtual URLS in relation to his project.
[00:50:09] <wkmanire> He wants to include jQuery in his page but he is using Server urls relative to drive D:
[00:50:35] <JKarsrud> sm3k: is the script in the same folder as your aspx-file?
[00:50:36] <sm3k> well as to dynamic page I have tried a method in C# called ClientScriptRegister()
[00:50:41] <sm3k> no luck there
[00:50:46] <sm3k> same old sstory
[00:50:49] <wkmanire> sm3k: Thats using a ScriptManager class
[00:50:55] <wkmanire> which was really designed for use with Atlas
[00:51:05] <wkmanire> Microsoft Ajax Library or whatever they called it.
[00:51:07] <JKarsrud> ugh, scriptmanager sucks
[00:51:15] <wkmanire> If you can dump Forms and go to MVC do it.
[00:51:22] <sm3k> Jkarsrud: it is now
[00:51:46] <JKarsrud> ok, then try: <% ResolveUrl("~/jquery-1.6.1.min.js") =>
[00:51:49] <JKarsrud> oop, %>
[00:51:53] <wkmanire> right
[00:52:04] <wkmanire> good night again, sm3k: I mean no offense to you
[00:52:32] <sm3k> no taken wkmanire
[00:52:35] <wkmanire> I've just been trying to whip together decent web projects with M$ Forms and MVC for about 3 years now and it just keeps getting more difficult the more I learn.
[00:52:39] <sm3k> good night and thanks again :)
[00:52:41] <wkmanire> Lets just say I'm bitter
[00:52:45] <sm3k> none taken*
[00:52:56] <zhrance> is someone familair with the IE9 Page length bug for the acccordion?
[00:53:06] <sm3k> lol you take care then :)
[00:54:46] <sm3k> JKarsrud: hmm still compilation error :-/
[00:54:55] <JKarsrud> Hmm, and it's at that line?
[00:54:57] <magcius> is there an easy way to make .attr() look in the parents?
[00:55:05] <JKarsrud> could you paste the whole aspx-file somewhere?
[00:55:05] <sm3k> yea
[00:55:44] <sm3k> escription: An error occurred during the compilation of a resource required to service this request. Please review the following specific error details and modify your source code appropriately.   Compiler Error Message: CS1002: ; expected
[00:55:54] <sm3k> I did for wkmanire already
[00:56:12] <JKarsrud> yeah, you're missing a ; behind the ResolveUrl() method
[00:56:14] <shkiper> how can I do that droppable plugin works with multipul droppable elements?
[00:56:15] <sm3k> here it is http://pastebin.com/Pwmcm1Cv
[00:56:25] <sm3k> oh
[00:57:37] <sm3k> k the code compiled now
[00:57:57] <sm3k> but have a look at this
[00:59:28] <sm3k> no wait it worked :D
[00:59:38] <JKarsrud> :)
[00:59:43] <JKarsrud> Good good
[00:59:44] <sm3k> thanks JKarsrud :D
[00:59:51] <JKarsrud> no problem dude
[01:00:15] <sm3k> finally I can get my work done. phew.
[01:00:20] <JKarsrud> hehe
[01:00:40] <sm3k> :)
[01:02:27] <sm3k> hey JKarsud, just one more thing :P
[01:02:45] <sm3k> the first line in my code has lit up for some reason
[01:03:03] <sm3k> <%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" CodeBehind="Default.aspx.cs" Inherits="Pjt1._Default" %>
[01:03:14] <sm3k> it says ; expected but the code compiles
[01:03:30] <sm3k> so you think there any reasons for worry?
[01:03:30] <JKarsrud> no ; expected there..
[01:03:47] <JKarsrud> nah
[01:03:55] <keirlav> can anyone recommend an email client with good support for html emails?
[01:04:10] <sm3k> kk thanks again man :)
[01:04:19] <zhrance> keirlav use mailchimp?
[01:04:31] <zhrance> 2000 users and 12.000 e-mails for free
[01:05:09] <keirlav> mailchimp is more for bulk email though from the use i've had previously, I was after something that I could just create an email in and whip it off to individuals without having to create campaigns etc
[01:05:56] <zhrance> ahhh ok
[01:06:16] <zhrance> don't now a good client for that...
[01:06:21] <keirlav> me neither :(
[01:06:45] <zhrance> keirlav are you familair with the jquery accordion?
[01:06:47] <keirlav> outlook is just so backward in its flexibility for html its saddening :P
[01:07:23] <zhrance> hehe
[01:07:29] <zhrance> outlook is kinda sad
[01:07:32] <keirlav> zhrance: to an extent, whats the problem your having?
[01:08:01] <zhrance> to be straight to the point: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/iewebdevelopment/thread/902aa3c2-51d1-4b29-9460-0bbddee14843
[01:08:05] <zhrance> got this bug exacly
[01:08:20] <zhrance> it's a common ie9 bug in the query accordion
[01:08:36] <zhrance> I don't have a clue how to fix it...
[01:10:04] <keirlav> is it the flicker before the script initialise and hides the accordion?
[01:10:30] <zhrance> no it's not, it's the scrollbar
[01:11:00] <zhrance> for some reason IE9 calculates the hide of the accordion when extended...
[01:11:32] <zhrance> hide = height
[01:11:33] <zhrance> sorry
[01:12:19] <keirlav> so your page doesnt have a scrollbar but in ie9 it does which is causing things to jump around when the page loads?
[01:12:29] <zhrance> yes exacly
[01:13:27] <aaronmcadam> ls -lsa
[01:15:32] <zhrance> any clue keirlav?
[01:26:25] <cjflory> zhrance:  could you try removing the height:100%; style from the html element, and see if that resolves the bug?
[01:27:15] <zhrance> cjflory yes it fixed the bug! :)
[01:27:17] <zhrance> cheers!
[01:27:26] <cjflory> cool!
[01:27:43] <mosez> somebody with comet knowledge here?
[01:28:39] <cjflory> I'm having trouble using "outerWidth()" on an image that was returned with ajax, and will be appended to the page
[01:29:45] <lkeijser> stupid question but if a variable var = '123' and my div id = 'id_123' , how can i format my selector?  $("id_" + var)  didn't work
[01:30:32] <cjflory> lkeijser: you would need $("#id_" + var)
[01:31:06] <truedeity> gradients -> http://jsfiddle.net/tdaEr/6/
[01:31:14] <lkeijser> cjflory: oh .. i meant with the '#' ,  so that's supposed to work?
[01:31:43] <cjflory> lkeijser: sure, i do it all the time...
[01:32:41] <keirlav> yes that method should work, is it not for you?
[01:32:42] <cjflory> lkeijser: you probably already know this, but you can't have your var named "var"
[01:32:46] <lkeijser> hm, then i must have done something wrong
[01:33:28] <keirlav> can you post a fiddle of it?
[01:35:55] <lkeijser> cjflory: i didn't know this, but the real variable isn't called var
[01:36:33] <lkeijser> still it doesn't work even if i call it by its real name $("id_123").hide()  so i must have done somethign else wrong ..
[01:36:51] <cjflory> lkeijser: yes, that's a good way to test it :)
[01:37:11] <cjflory> lkeijser: don't forget the # :D
[01:39:02] <lkeijser> lol
[01:39:19] <keirlav> heres an example of it working http://jsfiddle.net/b8P4z/
[01:41:15] <lkeijser> cjflory: if you could take a look at http://dpaste.com/563205/   i can hide the <input> by its id, but not the wrapping div
[01:41:18] <lind0r> hi. does someone have an example for an auto suggest script for jquery? i already did the ajax and css part. what's missing is the ability to select an option with keyup/keydown.
[01:41:22] <lkeijser> any idea why?
[01:41:29] <nielsb> hey all. I am trying to create an looping animation. Can someone have a look at my code?
[01:42:46] <keirlav> lkeijser can you post your code that selects the input pls?
[01:43:35] <cjflory> lkeijser: yes, that would help‚Ä¶to see your js
[01:44:04] <lkeijser> http://dpaste.com/563206/
[01:44:20] <cjflory> lkeijser: actually‚Ä¶i think the problem is because you're putting divs inside your <table> element
[01:44:23] <xec> lind0r: is this what youre after? http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete
[01:44:49] <cjflory> lkeijser: you should set those id values on the <tr> element, instead of a <div>
[01:44:55] <lkeijser> aha
[01:45:00] <lkeijser> let me try that
[01:47:12] <cjflory> lkeijser: another suggestion I would make, would be to use "slideUp()" on those <tr> elements, instead of "fadeOut()".  the animation might seem smoother‚Ä¶?
[01:49:27] <keirlav> am i not right in saying that input[name='order_id'] doesn't exist?
[01:49:48] <lkeijser> cjflory: thanks, works perfectly now :)
[01:50:03] <cjflory> lkeijser: cool!
[01:50:14] <nielsb> cjflory: would you mind taking a look at my code? :) I am trying to make something loop with animation
[01:50:54] <cjflory> nielsb: sure‚Ä¶where can I see it?
[01:50:56] <gym_jane> hi guys, i am doing something wrong here. all of the quotes appear vertically once in a while http://jsfiddle.net/mXQjt/
[01:50:57] <lkeijser> keirlav: you're right
[01:51:23] <lind0r> thankgs xec
[01:51:33] <lkeijser> it's funny that it still works then ...
[01:52:24] <lkeijser> keirlav: what would be a better way?
[01:53:46] <keirlav> what exactly is the effect your trying to achieve?
[01:55:25] <lkeijser> sorry, brb (kid calls)
[01:55:47] <keirlav> no worries
[01:56:48] <keirlav> my suggestion would be that if you are trying to hide specific input groups, i would iterate through each set, then hide its parent div
[01:57:26] <keirlav> something like $(input).each(function(){ $(this).parents('div .parent').slideUp(); });
[01:59:25] <aaronmcadam> _.each() :D

[02:12:58] <mark_scz> I'm playing around with jquery so i have something like <option value="1">something</option> in a select field. Is there anyway to drag out the current selections text? so there's .val that will get "1" and .text which will get ALL the text values...

[02:21:53] <rahmen> Hi! I have a form and want to access the data in the submit() function. So $('form').submit(function() { $(this).what? };
[02:24:17] <coldhead> it depends on what the form contains and what you want to do with it
[02:24:40] <coldhead> $('form').find(':input') will select most of the fields for you
[02:24:55] <rahmen> I know I can use $('.dateStart').val() to get the value of input with class dateStart. But I have an array also that is called "players".. so how do I get that?
[02:25:10] <aaronmcadam> or $('form').serializeArray() rahmen see ?serializeArray

[02:35:04] <coldhead> you can use those techniques with a bit of thought, safzouf
[02:35:16] <safzouf> okay thanks!
[02:35:17] <safzouf> I'll see
[02:35:38] <aaronmcadam> coldhead, i use that serializeData function to create a data structure for django forms so there's a one-to-one mapping
[02:36:10] <coldhead> Fandekasp[taff]: try googling for juqyer image lazy loading, that's the general name for the trick you want
[02:36:20] <coldhead> jquery* jesus christ i suck
[02:36:24] <Fandekasp[taff]> thx coldhead
[02:42:29] <aaronmcadam> anyone using jquery mobile at all?
[02:42:48] <aaronmcadam> and yes, I'm in the mobile channel too
[03:15:18] <coldhead> aaronmcadam: juha___ and wookiehangover are my goto guys for mobile
[03:18:10] <cjflory> can someone help me with a problem I'm having with outherWidth()?
[03:20:04] <Aamir> ?ask @cjflory
[03:20:05] <bot-t> cjflory, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:20:08] <Over|taf> hi all, i have a document with iframes, is there a way to check if a frame load by opening a new window and not inside my page ?
[03:21:09] <cjflory> i'm having trouble using outerWidth() to get the width of an image, that has been returned with ajax
[03:21:49] <Aamir> Over|taf: something to do with if ( parent.document..
[03:22:13] <Aamir> cjflory: what problem????
[03:22:53] <Aamir> Over|taf:  http://www.irt.org/script/frame.htm
[03:23:09] <cjflory> Aamir:  the width is always either 0, or it only gives me the margin/padding.  it doesn't give me the actual width of the image
[03:23:16] <Aamir> http://www.irt.org/script/54.htm
[03:25:05] <Over|taf> ty Aamir, but i need to place this code inside my iframe target html file
[03:25:10] <Over|taf> cannot do this :x
[03:25:19] <Aamir> cjflory:  alert( $('img').width() );
[03:25:23] <Aamir> opps
[03:25:28] <Aamir> http://jsfiddle.net/pPx5F/
[03:27:33] <cjflory> Aamir: Yes, that works fine‚Ä¶but not when I get the image html via ajax
[03:28:35] <cjflory> Aamir: my ajax returns some html, and I'm getting the <img> tag out of it, that I want.  I know it's getting it, because I can append it to the page.  but outerWidth() isn't returning the correct values
[03:29:36] <Aamir> cjflory:  http://jsfiddle.net/pPx5F/1/
[03:29:41] <Aamir> use .load
[03:31:05] <Skval> is there a way that is _built in_ in jquery to get the third class of an element? for instance if I have the following div: <div class="class1 class2 class3"> I want it to return class3.
[03:31:30] <Skval> the best thing I came up with is to get the list of classes and then use split
[03:31:36] <Aamir> Skval:  no. use  element.attr('class').split(' ')
[03:31:50] <Aamir> and [2] at the end
[03:32:33] <Kambfhase> why would you want to get the third class?
[03:33:31] <cjflory> Aamir: when I do that, width() return 0, and outerWidth(true) returns the padding + border + margin (but still not the width of the image)
[03:33:38] <Skval> Aamir, yeah that's what I was thinking.. it would have been nicer if there was a quicker way, thanks.
[03:34:21] <Skval> Kambfhase I have list of generic elements and I perform many operations on them.
[03:34:37] <Skval> The classes I have indicates properties of the elements
[03:34:52] <Skval> for instance: `redeemable` class indicates if the user can click the element or not.
[03:35:14] <Skval> gift class indicates that the generic element is a gift the user recieved.
[03:35:19] <Skval> etc..
[03:36:25] <misterm> Skval: wouldn't it just matter if the element has the class or not? where does order come in?
[03:36:35] <Kambfhase> Skval: why not check if the gift class exists on this element?
[03:37:36] <MoTiOnXml> when creating js objects, is the recommended approach to always quote the identifiers? i.e. { "x": value, "y": value }?
[03:38:04] <timing_> MoTiOnXml: nope
[03:38:06] <MoTiOnXml> i'm thinking that without being consistent, one could have collissions with reserved words
[03:38:09] <Kambfhase> MoTiOnXml: i recommend you to use qoute, when you do not know when you can leave them out
[03:38:12] <MoTiOnXml> i.e. class with jQuery
[03:38:24] <timing_> I never quote, unless it's class
[03:38:36] <timing_> or 'delete' or whatever :-)
[03:39:01] <MoTiOnXml> others? what do you say?
[03:40:08] <Skval> Kambfhase , misterm : I have like 6-7 different types of elements. There's another JS class which handles the operations, and decides where to send the request according to the type of the element. the alternative of a big switch statement in two different places dosen't look very attractive to me.
[03:40:09] <Kambfhase> use, qoutes, minifiers will remove them if they are unneccesary
[03:43:17] <misterm> Skval: but what's the significance of the order they appear in the class attribute? Why not just loop through the various classes and have a lookup table or something?
[03:45:52] <Skval> misterm: the order is not significant, but it's much more efficient if the classes has specific orders.
[03:45:59] <Skval> $(this).attr('class').split(' ')[2];
[03:46:01] <Skval> is better than
[03:46:08] <Skval> $(this).attr('class').split(' ')[2].each(...);
[03:46:14] <Skval> from performances POV
[03:46:25] <Skval> sorry, in the second line I meant
[03:46:34] <Skval> $(this).attr('class').split(' ').each(...);
[03:47:27] <misterm> Yea, but it seems brittle to me, I doubt the perf difference is significant
[03:47:38] <Kambfhase> $(this).attr('class').split(' ').each(...); << this wont work ;)
[03:48:09] <Aamir> jQuery.each( $element.attr('class').split(' '), function(){..})
[03:48:23] <Skval> thanks guys :)
[03:48:41] <Skval> misterm I guess you right, the performances difference is not very significant
[03:48:46] <Skval> but I save resources where I can
[03:49:06] <Skval> and in this case I don't see how ordering the classes can hurt my code's usibility
[03:49:37] <misterm> Skval: It seems brittle to me. What if the orders change somehow, or if you need to handle two types simultaneously
[03:50:17] <misterm> In terms of classes what should matter is if it has the class or not, the order of the classes in the class atrribute doesn't seem like a good place to store "information" imho, but by all means go with what works for you
[03:53:02] <Skval> misterm: I'm gon'a go with your solution, I guess it's better not to treat classes by their order.
[03:53:12] <Skval> but by their existance.
[03:53:14] <Skval> thanks.
[03:53:34] <Chib> anyone know of any 3d photo gallery type thingie plugins? (:
[03:53:39] <misterm> Skval: np, glad I could help
[03:54:25] <Freddi> i have a question
[03:54:59] <cjflory> Aamir:  here's exactly what I'm struggling with:  http://jsfiddle.net/cjflory/3JtrX/1/
[03:55:43] <Freddi> is it possible to use jQuery to change a display value base on what page you navigate to ? So that a subnavigation menu will be visible on certain pages ?
[03:56:23] <BlaDe> SCRIPT65535: Unexpected call to method or property access.  ------ jquery.1.6.1.min.js, line 17 character 28710
[03:56:28] <BlaDe> i get this in IE7 only - any ideas ?
[04:03:54] <cjflory> does anyone have any idea why I cannot get the width of an image loaded with ajax?  (see http://jsfiddle.net/cjflory/3JtrX/1/ for an example of what's happening)
[04:04:03] <Guest37812> Iam using an ajax request to get the html content of a specific page url. Is it possible to use jQuery to parse the result ? If I do $(result).find('body') return null :/
[04:04:37] <Freddi> BlaDe, stop developing for ie 7 :P Do you have a choice ?
[04:05:00] <BlaDe> Freddi nope :(
[04:05:17] <BlaDe> Freddi i went through a lot of pain to get everything else working on IE7, this is the last one heh
[04:05:26] <BlaDe> SCRIPT65535: Unexpected call to method or property access.  ---- jquery.1.6.2.min.js, line 17 character 29113
[04:05:29] <BlaDe> same error with 1.6.2
[04:05:34] <keirlav> whats the problem, i have the width returned as 160px?
[04:05:38] <Freddi> what is the end result is it not loading the jQuery lib ?
[04:05:50] <BlaDe> nope everything -seems- to be working nearly ok actually
[04:05:53] <cjflory> Guest37812: try using $(result).filter('body')
[04:06:04] <BlaDe> i have an autocomplete box and the popup doesn't close properly, and also when you hover over an element it should get bigger but it doesn't
[04:06:20] <BlaDe> Freddi would you like to see a live demo?
[04:06:52] <keirlav> cjflory: i am getting the width returned, whats the problem your having?
[04:07:31] <Freddi> BlaDe, sure but i'm not really a backedn developer, mostly front end so if it cant be debugged in firebug i'm not sure how much i can help
[04:08:07] <cjflory> keirlav: what widths are you getting?  the numbers i was getting was 0 first, and then 20 (which is the margin of that image, but not the width)
[04:08:10] <BlaDe> goto upload a file, you'll get a form show up - see the "To:" field? type "t" in the box
[04:08:14] <BlaDe> that's the area causing the error
[04:08:23] <keirlav> im getting 160 and 180
[04:08:28] <BlaDe> excuse the slow site, it's hosted in a vm on my laptop heh
[04:08:57] <Guest37812> thanks cjflory but it do not works too
[04:09:05] <Freddi> BlaDe, it also occurs to me taht i dont have IE7 on my laptopp either why did they take away compatability in IE9 ?
[04:09:12] <BlaDe> they didn't
[04:09:13] <Freddi> sec i'll use Adobe browser lab
[04:09:17] <BlaDe> i'm using ie9
[04:09:20] <Freddi> WHAT!?
[04:09:21] <BlaDe> press f12 set browser mode to ie7
[04:09:27] <Freddi> sec how retarded am i
[04:09:42] <cjflory> keirlav: that's really strange.  I'm getting 0 & 20.  what browser are you using?
[04:09:47] <keirlav> whats the link blade i'll give it a look
[04:09:48] <Guest37812> seems to works $('<div>').html(response).find("body").text() like that but it try to execute page js so I get ReferenceError: adSetAdURL is not defined
[04:10:04] <keirlav> cjflory: using FF and just tried in IE 9 both worked
[04:10:05] <MoTiOnXml> do i have to add "px" to e.g. css({ top: value })?
[04:10:08] <BlaDe> SCRIPT87: Invalid argument. - jquery.1.6.2.min.js, line 18 character 20327
[04:10:10] <BlaDe> the other error I get
[04:10:14] <MoTiOnXml> i mean, it works without but is it recommended?
[04:10:18] <keirlav> cjflory: what browser are you using?
[04:10:22] <cjflory> keirlav: i'm using chrome‚Ä¶lemme try ff
[04:10:22] <BlaDe> MoTiOnXml you should add it
[04:10:31] <MoTiOnXml> BlaDe: that is, be explicit?
[04:10:43] <BlaDe> MoTiOnXml you should add 'px', always
[04:10:49] <keirlav> cfjlory: is it when running locally you have hte problems?
[04:10:50] <MoTiOnXml> ok, thanks
[04:10:52] <BlaDe> it has become more relaxed recently, though
[04:10:54] <MoTiOnXml> BlaDe: reason? :)
[04:11:13] <cjflory> keirlav: FF is working fine, i get 160 & 180
[04:11:13] <keirlav> chrome has some extra sandboxing issues that i've experienced, especially when testing things locally
[04:11:28] <BlaDe> MoTiOnXml because so many people don't add it I guess
[04:11:45] <MoTiOnXml> BlaDe: so element.css({ "top": value.toString() + "px" }); ?
[04:11:45] <BlaDe> jquery has become more tollerant but it still can cause unexpected behaviour
[04:11:58] <cjflory> keirlav: but the example on jsfiddle isn't local‚Ä¶and i'm getting 0 & 20 there
[04:12:00] <BlaDe> MoTiOnXml intParse() might be better - but sure
[04:12:11] <MoTiOnXml> intParse?
[04:12:16] <BlaDe> it should be an int not a string
[04:12:27] <MoTiOnXml> ?!
[04:12:33] <BlaDe> nevermind, stick with that :-)
[04:12:35] <cjflory> keirlav: but, i'm glad to know it's just a chrome thing‚Ä¶maybe i can find someone else w/ this same problem now :)
[04:12:37] <Kambfhase> parseInt() you mean?
[04:12:42] <BlaDe> ah, yeah, t hat too :-)
[04:12:43] <MoTiOnXml> BlaDe: no, tell me
[04:13:00] <MoTiOnXml> i've got an int value and you want me to add the px to it, hence i convert to string to be explicit
[04:13:04] <aaronmcadam> don't need parseInt() unless the value could contain a string
[04:13:07] <BlaDe> too much .net for me it seems
[04:13:15] <MoTiOnXml> the value is not a string; it's a number
[04:13:23] <aaronmcadam> ?eval( typeof +'1');
[04:13:27] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, #1890 (XML Broken on IE 7 and Opera 9.23 with jquery version 1.2.1 ... - Opened 4 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1890
[04:13:31] <aaronmcadam> ah christ
[04:13:32] <MoTiOnXml> in .NET it's int.Parse or TryParse ;)
[04:13:37] <juha___> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrLx27Wo9t0 :D
[04:13:40] <BlaDe> yeah hence where I got intParse from
[04:14:16] <MoTiOnXml> is the .tostring() also required for completely compliance?
[04:14:25] <MoTiOnXml> i read js converts to string automatically where required
[04:14:43] <keirlav> havnt got chrome on this comp at work but have you tried changing the long tailed url in the post request to '../'
[04:14:45] <aaronmcadam> you don't need toString
[04:14:47] <Guest37812> http://pastebin.com/hM41wbM4 <- someone could help me how to parse the result ?
[04:15:03] <gym_jane> I can't speak in #php for some reason :/
[04:15:06] <aaronmcadam> why are you trying to get a string when you want a number
[04:15:21] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to specify px
[04:15:22] <dabear> Guest37812: .html
[04:15:24] <gym_jane> guys, is there any way of ensuring the contents of an iframe is only accessible through a certain page?
[04:15:27] <aaronmcadam> MoTiOnXml,
[04:15:30] <BlaDe> aaronmcadam you should specify px
[04:15:32] <aaronmcadam> MoTiOnXml, { top : 5 }
[04:15:34] <BlaDe> it's only in recent versions it isn't required
[04:15:34] <aaronmcadam> no
[04:15:38] <Guest37812> dabear: .html ?
[04:15:43] <aaronmcadam> its redudant
[04:15:45] <dabear> yea, not .text
[04:15:47] <keirlav> cjflory: have you tried changing the long tailed url in the post request to '../' in case it is a sandbox issue?
[04:15:52] <MoTiOnXml> does jquery add it itself?
[04:15:56] <keirlav> cjflory: havnt got chrome on this comp at work so can't test it myself
[04:16:01] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't need a px
[04:16:06] <Guest37812> I get "ReferenceError: adSetAdURL is not defined"
[04:16:08] <aaronmcadam> jquery removes the px itself
[04:16:20] <Kambfhase> Guest37812: do you own "http://techcrunch.com" or is you page on there?
[04:16:31] <MoTiOnXml> i'll revert to original

[04:16:48] <MoTiOnXml> jslint complaints with Type confusion: function and .css: object
[04:16:51] <cjflory> keirlav: do you mean the url i'm passing in as data?
[04:16:55] <Guest37812> an Iam trying to parse the result
[04:17:03] <cjflory> keirlav: or the url i'm posting to?
[04:17:32] <Guest37812> Kambfhase: no i do not own techrunch.com :) just trying to parse the result of an ajax request
[04:17:50] <keirlav> <img src="http://jsfiddle.net/img/logo.png" id="myimg" /> try changing to src="../img/logo.png" - just an idea, nto sure if it will work
[04:17:52] <Kambfhase> Guest37812: ever heard of the "Same Origin Policy"?
[04:18:20] <Kambfhase> that my be the problem here
[04:18:32] <Guest37812> it's not the problem
[04:18:38] <Guest37812> I have unactive this security
[04:18:44] <cjflory> keirlav: interesting‚Ä¶that works!

[04:51:16] <SoulRaven> hi
[04:51:31] <Kambfhase> MoTiOnXml: yes. (there can be exceptions but lets not deive too deep)
[04:51:48] <SoulRaven> is it posible to select 2 element from .load() ajax fetch?
[04:52:23] <SoulRaven> .load('/path #element1 #element2')
[04:52:34] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: i was told by jslint to fix it :)
[04:52:44] <MoTiOnXml> hmm, would be nice to find some jQuery jslint settings
[04:53:05] <MoTiOnXml> Kambfhase: i have this: document.location.href = "/" + (state.json.id || cms.state.pageID);

[04:53:27] <MoTiOnXml> don't know
[04:53:38] <BlaDe> Kambfhase I thought this would do the trick but it doesn't: http://pastie.org/private/yiwobceq9tiucrl6qcea4q

[04:54:11] <BlaDe> i'll try proxy

[05:01:58] <pr0ton> ignore ^_^
[05:03:50] <Heliodor> Isn't jquery taconite supposed to work in more browsers than only Chrome?
[05:04:53] <BlaDe> why is $(this).position()/offset evaluated before the timer is executed?
[05:05:20] <Kambfhase> ?p @ BlaDe
[05:05:20] <bot-t> BlaDe, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:05:48] <BlaDe> http://fixee.org/paste/yh2svr4/
[05:05:56] <BlaDe> doesn't indent well there at all... :-)
[05:06:08] <BlaDe> the console.log's of position/offset are the same before, and after the timer log - when they shouldn't be.
[05:06:21] <BlaDe> basically I don't want that popup to open if the mouse has moved off the element
[05:08:39] <Kambfhase> ?g hoverIntent @ BlaDe
[05:08:40] <bot-t> BlaDe, hoverIntent jQuery Plug-in - http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[05:08:44] <Kambfhase> may be that will help
[05:09:09] <BlaDe> i'm not sure I need a new plugin for this small bug
[05:09:19] <BlaDe> if offset/position were live it should work
[05:09:19] <mosez> how could i add and access event data?
[05:09:31] <mosez> .live( eventType, eventData, handler )
[05:10:01] <mosez> i found this on various events within the docs. but what have i got to write to add eventData? and how can i access it?
[05:11:11] <Kambfhase> I dont get it :/
[05:12:13] <BlaDe> Kambfhase: http://pastie.org/private/6uquqj7lluffo67miodrq <- indented better
[05:12:26] <BlaDe> the console.log output is the same before, and after the setTimeout() when it shouldn't be
[05:13:13] <Kambfhase> i dont see whe it you have changed in first place
[05:14:01] <BlaDe> sorry?
[05:15:10] <Kambfhase> i mean, why should the $(this).offset() change between the two logs?
[05:15:23] <BlaDe> ah yeah you're right.. e.clientX/Y I should be using
[05:15:52] <BlaDe> how can I stop it firing twice, as well?
[05:19:31] <mazzachre> Having a table with thead and tbody, in tbody, some rows with a button in one field, attaching a $('table').delegate('button', 'click', myFunction) and in myFunction doing $(this).parentsUntil('tbody').css("background", "red") I would expect the row background to turn red, but it don't the td containing the button turns red... Why does parentsUntil('tbody') not return the tr?
[05:22:19] <Kambfhase> mazzachre: try $(this).closest()
[05:22:57] <BlaDe> Kambfhase i have the same problem with e.clientX inside the setTimeout()
[05:23:59] <Kambfhase> well, yeah, its still the old mouse move event.
[05:25:37] <MoTiOnXml> got a weird scenario with .toggle()
[05:25:53] <MoTiOnXml> my impression is that it toggles "display", correct?
[05:27:43] <mazzachre> Kambfhase: What would that do? I want the tr selected (because I store an ID on that element I want to use for the function in question)
[05:28:07] <Kambfhase> ?toggle @ MoTiOnXml
[05:28:08] <bot-t> MoTiOnXml, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[05:28:36] <Kambfhase> mazzachre: .closest('tr') looks up the .pranets() until it finds a 'tr' and returns that
[05:28:44] <BlaDe> Kambfhase got it working like this: http://pastie.org/private/holpcakj0beb6d8juoq
[05:29:27] <mazzachre> Kambfhase: Ah ok, thx
[05:30:45] <Segaja> BlaDe: are you still working on your file-tree?
[05:31:01] <BlaDe> Segaja not right now that's finished :)
[05:32:51] <Segaja> BlaDe: i see. so you fixed your CSS issue and the toggle was correct right?
[05:33:03] <BlaDe> yep just added a margin-top:-21px iirc
[05:33:52] <MoTiOnXml> if i have a class that sets display:none; and then call .toggle() on the element, it doesn't work
[05:34:08] <JKarsrud> ?toggleClass
[05:34:09] <bot-t> .toggleClass(className): Add or remove a class from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[05:35:58] <Anticom> i've got a problem with the datepicker: it's getting rendered way to big (i've downloaded jq-ui with default theme). how can i make it smaller without having to rewrite the whole css?
[05:37:42] <MoTiOnXml> JKarsrud: thanks, but doesn't the toggle() do the same?
[05:37:53] <Segaja> i have a question: with e.preventDefault() i can interrupt an event. is there some way to do the opposite, continue an interrupted event?
[05:37:57] <MoTiOnXml> JKarsrud: or is that only if the display style has been set explicitly?
[05:38:36] <JKarsrud> toggle toggles functions to be run when you click an element or something, toggleClass only checks to see if a class is set on the element, and if not, sets it
[05:38:42] <JKarsrud> if it is set, it removes it
[05:38:45] <JKarsrud> ?toggle
[05:38:46] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[05:38:48] <JKarsrud> ?toggleClass
[05:38:48] <bot-t> .toggleClass(className): Add or remove a class from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[05:39:02] <MoTiOnXml> yes, but according to docs toggle() toggles visibility by default
[05:39:11] <MoTiOnXml> and i'm speculating it's not picking it up correctly from the class
[05:39:40] <JKarsrud> I guess not
[05:40:21] <MoTiOnXml> maybe it's got something to do with the naming of the class
[05:40:27] <MoTiOnXml> it's called "display-none"
[05:40:54] <MoTiOnXml> it used to work before i refactored the name from "hidden" or "none" to "display-none"
[05:41:13] <Segaja> so try changing it again and see if it works then
[05:41:19] <MoTiOnXml> let me try
[05:42:53] <MoTiOnXml> ah, there's some !important on the class
[05:43:28] <MoTiOnXml> i bet that's why
[05:50:46] <koskoz> hi
[05:51:12] <koskoz> does someone know a jquery plugin which display a dropdown like in this example: http://koskoz.info/dropdown.png ?

[05:55:59] <ericincoldohio> anyone familiar with the ui/dialog?  I have  bug I can't seem to fix
[05:57:46] <koskoz> ericincoldohio: go for it
[05:58:23] <ericincoldohio> It shows up fine in all the browsers, except the computed height of the top border is like 960px instead of about 30
[05:58:35] <koskoz> link?
[05:58:37] <ericincoldohio> so the whole modal takes up the height of the entire page
[05:58:59] <ericincoldohio> codes behind a server...back in a few...
[05:59:48] <ericincoldohio> what site has the cut/paste with jquery support?
[06:00:12] <ericincoldohio> like pastebin, but handles jquery
[06:02:19] <Freddi> how do i go about test if a varibale is equallt to a value specified within an array ?
[06:02:54] <skript> if($foo == bar[1]){ #winning }
[06:03:58] <Freddi> bar[1] being the arrray og a value with in that array ?
[06:05:09] <bjensen> if I trigger  my custom event..can I pass on values to it?
[06:05:29] <Kambfhase> yes, use the eventData param
[06:12:16] <bjensen> I have a $("body").delegate(".new_ingredient_link", "click", function(){  console.log("fdsfdsfs"); }); but its not triggered..full src is here: http://pastie.org/2167175
[06:12:53] <oxez_> hello. I have a parent <div> with a click event bound. I have multiple <a> elements inside that also have click events bound. My problme is that when I click an <a>, the function that is bound to <div> click event is called first, so using stopPropagation doesn't work for the <a>, is there a way to workaround that?
[06:14:02] <aaronmcadam> lads, any idea on how I might return the key from an obj literal in a $.each?
[06:14:09] <aaronmcadam> http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/E9Qn3/
[06:19:41] <enoj> hey, when I use jQuery.hotkeys (resigs on github) to bind 'keydown' on document with chars "Ctrl+f", it triggers when either of Ctrl or f key is pressed down, not only when both are at the same time .. what am I missing here?
[06:20:40] <markj> aaronmcadam when you use each on an object literal the callbacks arguments are key and value, not index
[06:20:53] <aaronmcadam> yea i got it dude thanks
[06:21:10] <markj> good stuff

[06:25:05] <BlaDe> can I search .children() for an option[value=...] ?
[06:25:13] <BlaDe> element.children("option[value=" + object.value + "]").hasClass("selected")) <--- isn't working properly
[06:25:14] <jY> yes
[06:28:15] <kborchers> BlaDe: you need single quotes around your object.value like element.children("option[value='" + object.value + "']").hasClass("selected"))
[06:29:43] <BlaDe> kborchers ah i'll try that!.... code/output is here .. just prepared it darn. http://pastie.org/2167228
[06:30:33] <BlaDe> yup that fixed it, just the quotes. thanks

[06:33:08] <Freddi> how do i check is a variable containing a URL is equal to a different varialbe containing the same URL ?
[06:37:05] <Kambfhase> if( var1 == var2){ /* w00t */ }
[06:38:51] <aaronmcadam>  if( var1 === var2) { ... }
[06:39:40] <aaronmcadam> ?eval 'url' === 'url'
[06:39:42] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: true
[06:39:51] <Rushing> i don't think he's saying the variables are the same, i think he's saying one of them contains another
[06:39:59] <aaronmcadam> maybe ahh
[06:40:11] <Rushing> so you'd do a regex or an indexOf
[06:40:17] <aaronmcadam> yeah i've got a gist
[06:40:39] <aaronmcadam> yeah indexOf would do
[06:40:41] <Rushing> if(var1.indexOf(var2) === 0) ... if you want to make sure var1 starts with var2
[06:40:53] <Rushing> or var1.indexOf(var2) > 0 if you just want to see if it's in there somewhere
[06:41:02] <aaronmcadam> or if it  contains, !== 1
[06:41:04] <aaronmcadam> or if it  contains, !== -1
[06:42:31] <bjensen> if I do a document.write("<a class="fdsfds">fds</a>", will jquery then look at it as if its part of the DOM?
[06:42:34] <oxez> if I have <div><a></a></div>, how can I make sure that when I click <a>, it's click event is fired BEFORE the div's?
[06:42:52] <seutje> doc.write is evil!
[06:42:52] <Rushing> bjensen, yes, bu ti wouldn't use document.write
[06:43:17] <bjensen> sure guys. I was just trying to make an example. My real problem is this: http://pastie.org/2167175
[06:43:24] <Rushing> do something like var $newguy = $("<a>...</a>").appendTo("body")
[06:44:03] <aaronmcadam> oxez, it would fire before what are u trying to do
[06:44:56] <seutje> oxez: u can't control that order, it's defined in the spec afaik

[06:45:09] <bot-t> oxez, Javascript - Event order - QuirksMode - http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_order.html
[06:45:17] <aaronmcadam> it's to do with the bubbling
[06:45:38] <seutje> u can capture and hijack it, but u can't change the order
[06:45:43] <aaronmcadam> you can try to manipulate it with see ?preventDefault and see ?stopPropagation
[06:45:43] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[06:45:43] <bot-t> event.stopPropagation(): This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[06:46:09] <oxez> Clicking on the div => creates a new <a> at the mouse coords, clicking on a <a> => show some info, but what happens now when I click <a> => create a new one, then show info
[06:46:27] <oxez> aaronmcadam: I tried that, but it's not doing anything since <a>'s click is fired after
[06:47:02] <Rushing> see if it already has the a
[06:47:52] <mazzachre> Kambfhase: thx, that works as expected... Is parentsUntil just strange? Or am I not understanding it correctly?
[06:48:07] <Kambfhase> never used it.
[06:48:48] <Kambfhase> ?event.stopPropagation @ oxez

[06:48:50] <bjensen> Im using the tokeninput plugin and when I try to add a new entry button, i cant attach to it:     noResultsText: "Ingen ingredienser fundet.<a href='#' class='new_ingredient_link'>create_new</a>". But I can change its behavior using stylesheets. Ive tried .delegate and #live and #bind..
[06:49:11] <oxez> Kambfhase: That would work if the children's event would be called FIRST, it's called LAST right now
[06:49:23] <Kambfhase> i doubt that
[06:53:36] <patrick91> Hi
[06:55:00] <patrick91> anyone that has some experience with jquery masonry plugin?
[06:55:14] <patrick91> I want to animate it on start
[06:55:17] <aaronmcadam> no, looks cool though
[06:55:18] <bjensen> I cant insert a link within a dropdown?
[07:02:09] <AGoat> Anyone have time for a dumb validate question?  http://pastie.org/2167354
[07:12:50] <kborchers> AGoat: if those are text fields, they will not evaluate to null. check for "". also, i think what you want is both of them to be != and use a || not &&
[07:16:02] <bjensen> how do I make a dropdown element respond to a click?
[07:18:40] <AGoat> kborchers: thanks! I'll give that a shot.
[07:19:52] <AGoat> It'll actually be (!= && ==) || (== && !=), but the null problem may be the key
[07:20:11] <AGoat> unless there's a better way to do that
[07:21:32] <kborchers> AGoat: you're right on that part. sorry i read it wrong and was doing at least one and forgot about the not both part
[07:22:18] <AGoat> Do you *have* to add class rules for a custom method?
[07:22:58] <salazr> hey, so i'm working on a widget and have a fairly silly question
[07:23:21] <kborchers> AGoat: it's been a while since i used that plugin but i don't think so. i think it uses your default class rules if you don't specify
[07:23:28] <salazr> how can i create my target div on a third party site that's right next to the iframe?
[07:23:32] <salazr> errr
[07:23:41] <salazr> script tag that i'm having users paste?
[07:24:15] <salazr> i guess i can look for the script tag matching my script url and create a div next to it?
[07:24:17] <t4nkd> What's the syntax for conditionals in functions?

[07:29:20] <BlaDe> i have a weird problem.: http://pastie.org/2167497 -- lines 4-6 seem to submit the form
[07:31:11] <adbe> BlaDe: try $('option:selected').each( instead
[07:31:13] <Boozeniges> BlaDe: you need to preventDefault in there, as you're not stopping the native functionality of clicking on a forms submit button from submitting the form
[07:31:33] <adbe> and that
[07:32:00] <BlaDe> the prevent default wouldn't trigger because those lines submit it
[07:32:51] <Boozeniges> BlaDe: not quite, the form would have submitted before the function even gets called as it currently stands
[07:32:57] <BlaDe> option:selected fixed it :)
[07:33:14] <Boozeniges> assuming that '.submit' in a submit button
[07:44:59] <salazr> fix for my issue was this: (where script = the script tag)    script.parentElement.innerHTML += '<div id="target">';
[07:48:39] <BlaDe> $('<input />').attr('name', 'recpemail').attr('id', 'recpemail').val(string).appendTo($('#start form'));

[08:06:37] <t4nkd> Doesn't seem to ever get to the nested function, is it a syntax problem or..?
[08:08:04] <bbttxu> t4nkd: does empty take a callback? doesn't seem to indicate it does in the docs
[08:08:29] <t4nkd> Oh, I see, I'm pretty unfamiliar with trying to make callbacks and the like
[08:09:12] <t4nkd> So, if the doc doesn't outline to the effect of .func({options},{callback}) so-to-speak, I can't nest functions innit
[08:09:51] <bbttxu> see http://api.jquery.com/animate/ which does take a callback argument
[08:09:54] <t4nkd> Is there a clever way to chain another function onto that so I can make it *like* a callback?
[08:10:55] <t4nkd> Okay I see, so [complete] is what stipulates nesting functions
[08:11:01] <t4nkd> ty for your help
[08:11:03] <bbttxu> callbacks are useful for asynchronous events, like animations which take time
[08:11:17] <revnoah> I'm trying to dispaly a progress dialog before posting data, and then hiding it after. However, when I call $.mobile.hidePageLoadingMsg () it cancels submitting my form. Any idea why?
[08:11:37] <bbttxu> in your case, empty is (near) instantaneous. i think you can just call them sequentially
[08:12:03] <BlaDe> $('<input />').attr('name', 'recpemail').attr('id', 'recpemail').val(string).appendTo($('#start form'));
[08:12:05] <BlaDe> "string" has content, but: Content-Disposition: form-data; name="recpemail"  ----- no data is sent, any ideas why?

[08:15:14] <BlaDe> is the same without that :<

[08:16:08] <Vorspire> BlaDe, try adding the input to the DOM, then applying the attributes etc
[08:16:20] <BlaDe> so appendTo then .attr() ?
[08:16:51] <adbe> chrisbovard: $(this).parent() instead

[08:20:51] <chrisbovard> adbe: is there where you use parents()?
[08:20:54] <adbe> chrisbovard: http://jsfiddle.net/qZCjb/7/
[08:21:39] <chrisbovard> adbe: wicked!!!! Thanks so much. I just learned something big.
[08:22:55] <kborchers> chrisbovard: you could also use .closest("li") instead of parent().parent()
[08:22:58] <adbe> chrisbovard: or $(this).closest('li') would do it
[08:23:00] <adbe> yea

[08:35:27] <SalmanPK> <@foo> message
[08:35:41] <ryanneufeld> savetheinternet: start by googling "lemon party"
[08:35:50] <savetheinternet> ok
[08:35:54] <systemfault> SalmanPK: If you care.. the difference is that frameworks use inversion of control and are often opinionated.

[08:37:35] <savetheinternet> nothing
[08:37:43] <adbe> interesting
[08:37:59] <nguyendh> good morning folks,
[08:38:11] <SalmanPK> systemfault: Yeah i do, Thanks :)
[08:45:40] <AGoat> With many thanks to kborchers earlier, are there any validate gurus around? Having an issue with a custom method.  http://pastie.org/2167770
[08:47:52] <lunks> How can I specify the content type I want with $.get()?
[08:48:37] <bbttxu> ?get
[08:48:38] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[08:48:49] <bbttxu> lunks: ^^^ see docs
[08:49:21] <harriswong> ?hash
[08:49:22] <bot-t> harriswong, hash | jQuery Plugins - This is route plugin for easy manipulate location.hash and history http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/hash
[08:49:47] <lunks> bbttxu: it's actually this one: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ but it just says dataType there as an optional parameter. I don't know /how/ to use it.
[08:51:18] <quicksilver> lunks: you generally don't need to use it
[08:51:29] <bbttxu> lunks, those are the same page. what code do you have now?
[08:51:50] <quicksilver> if the server is generating the right content-type header then jquery.get will choose the right way to interpret the data
[08:52:21] <quicksilver> bbttxu: http://api.jquery.com/get/ and http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/ are very different functions.
[08:52:44] <lunks> bbttxu quicksilver it's requesting */* and for a Rails app and it is trying to show it an html. I want it to request javascript only
[08:52:59] <adbe> lunks: see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ dataType Default: Intelligent Guess (xml, json, script, or html)
[08:53:44] <bbttxu> quicksilver: got tabs mixed up, thanks for the correction
[08:54:06] <quicksilver> lunks: jQuery.get has no way to set custom request headers
[08:54:38] <quicksilver> lunks: although....
[08:54:39] <lunks> oh, so is dataType what jQuery will do with it? Not the actual request header?
[08:54:43] <quicksilver> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:54:58] <quicksilver> lunks: it used to be. But recent jQuery says I might be wrong
[08:55:12] <quicksilver> lunks: anyhow, that page shows the 'accepts' parameter which AFAIK is what you want
[08:55:23] <quicksilver> but it also says it is determined by dataType by default which is interesting.
[08:55:53] <lunks> hmm there is accepts and dataType
[08:55:56] <quicksilver> lunks: anyhow, jQuery.get is just a lazy shortcut, the above link to ajax is the full function with better documnetation
[08:56:23] <lunks> quicksilver: yeah, I should probably be using it. accepts is the one I want, not dataType. Thank you. :)
[08:56:28] <lunks> Thank you all. :)
[08:56:44] <Vorspire> ?eval $.fn.jquery;
[08:56:45] <bot-t> Vorspire: "1.4.2"
[08:56:59] <t4nkd> Hey all, what's the syntax to say, All elements #foo removeClass('bar');
[08:57:15] <Vorspire> $("#foo").empty()
[08:57:18] <systemfault> All?
[08:57:22] <t4nkd> Because I seem to only get the first selector simply doing $('#foo').
[08:57:26] <Vorspire> $("#foo").empty()
[08:57:36] <japherwocky> t4nkd: usually # is an id, and expected to be unique
[08:57:41] <Vorspire> lol whoops
[08:57:45] <t4nkd> Touche
[08:57:49] <Raverix> t4nkd: "All elements #foo'
[08:57:55] <Raverix> There should only be one element #foo
[08:58:03] <t4nkd> Yeah thankyou this occoured to me
[08:58:03] <Raverix> You mean all children? descendents?
[08:58:10] <t4nkd> No I meant all elements #foo
[08:58:11] <t4nkd> :P
[08:58:24] <t4nkd> That was, dumb, thanks for pointing it out all
[08:59:09] <afink> do jquery posts always unfocus an active textbox?
[08:59:13] <Vorspire> t4nkd it's all part of the learning curve :P
[08:59:26] <afink> p.s. I mean jquery ajax posts
[08:59:42] <t4nkd> lol, yeah especially when I'm trying to use like 30 lines of HTML through partials for the entire site :P
[09:00:09] <Vorspire> afink, if it does, you could just return focus after request success
[09:00:16] <t4nkd> That makes me worry I've got other ID's in collections actually but, we'll burn that bridge later
[09:00:54] <Vorspire> temp02 ``
[09:02:01] <AGoat> Using groups:{} in validate, along with other rules:{}, do the rules have to contain a reference to the group? The group is linked to a custom Method.
[09:02:05] <t4nkd> ty again all :)
[09:02:35] <afink> Vorspire: ok, I'll give that a try, thank you.  Not sure if it will b/c the element I want to re-focus doesn't exist until after user interaction.
[09:03:17] <afink> also the jquery post doesn't have anything to do with this portion of the website, so I wonder if there is a different way
[09:03:41] <Vorspire> afink, I think JQ 1.6.2 has some new methods that can help with that.. something about deferring code, I've not actually looked into it yet but they might be what you need
[09:03:51] <afink> ok thanks
[09:08:53] <mattp_> can i use $.attr('id', 'xyz') to set #xyz as an id to a variable?
[09:09:09] <dvgsvc> anyone knows answer to this : http://forum.jquery.com/topic/multiple-item-selection
[09:10:53] <dgouldin> I have an odd question: how would I use jQuery to create a body tag? What I want is something like $('<body class="foo bar"></body>')
[09:11:05] <dabear> dgouldin: like that
[09:11:18] <la00> hello
[09:11:23] <dabear> hola
[09:11:33] <dgouldin> dabear: doesn't work, jQuery.clean wraps the html in a div, and the browser refuses to put <body> inside <div>
[09:12:10] <dabear> dgouldin: $([document.createElement("body")]) then
[09:12:20] <la00> hello...any idea why datepicker can have ->on the heading  Maio 111  instead of Maio 2011 ?
[09:12:38] <dgouldin> dabear: so how do I get from an html string to a fully qualified DOM element with all its attributes?
[09:12:41] <la00> I'm using a timepicker extension
[09:12:54] <orl> hello
[09:12:56] <la00> http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ <-this one
[09:13:14] <dabear> no idea
[09:13:25] <dabear> i have never ever needed to create body tags
[09:13:44] <dgouldin> dabear: yeah, I realize I'm off the beaten path here :/
[09:13:44] <orl> I've a jQuery script that doesn't run (or doesn't work at least) when loading the page, but a copy/paste into Firebug console + execution works. How can I track the problem?
[09:14:24] <dgouldin> dabear: the bigger picture of what I'm trying to do is request a document via ajax and update the existing document's body tag to match the newly-requested one
[09:14:29] <orl> it's a 1-line script: $('dt#tSocia15').mouseenter(function(){$('dd#dSocia15').css('visibility', 'visible');}); (dispatched on three lines in the original file, but)
[09:14:51] <dgouldin> and I found myself either writing an html parser or fooling jQuery into doing it for me somehow
[09:14:56] <bbttxu> orl: are you using document.ready()?
[09:15:04] <Vorspire> orl is it wrapped in the dom.ready handler function?
[09:16:14] <orl> bbttxu: yes I am
[09:16:28] <orl> Vorspire: I didn't understand your question, sorry
[09:17:24] <Vorspire> orl, my question was the same as bbttzu :P
[09:17:37] <orl> ah, OK
[09:17:58] <bbttxu> orl: does it come after you pull in jquery?
[09:18:05] <Vorspire> is it a script included with a <script src="myscript.js"> tag?
[09:18:12] <orl> Vorspire: yes
[09:18:18] <Vorspire> ahh
[09:18:25] <Vorspire> you'll need to use the plgin wrapper
[09:18:28] <Vorspire> plugin*
[09:18:54] <Vorspire> well, that's what I call it. You need to wrap the entire code in an "immediately-executed function"
[09:19:00] <ohcibi> is each() performed synchronously?
[09:19:14] <orl> Vorspire: could you explain me a bit more? I mean, I already have such scripts that are called that way, and they work without any problems (and use each)
[09:19:55] <orl> bbttxu: is your question equal to: "did you add a line invoking jQuery before"?
[09:19:56] <Vorspire> (function($){ /*All Your Code Are Belong Here*/ }(jQuery));
[09:20:35] <orl> Vorspire: OK, I'll try that, shall I do that for the whole scripts I use? or only once and for all?
[09:21:13] <orl> please note I don't have any error in the console, and that very same script works when I copy/paste it to Firebug execution utility
[09:21:32] <doncams> a little help here http://pastebin.com/dPjkSfuG, i'm trying to pass the value from an external json file to a var. still undefined
[09:21:35] <Vorspire> orl I would think it's best practise to do it to all included scripts that use jQuery, that way you don't have any conflictions with $ since it's assigned to jQuery by the wrapper function
[09:22:01] <Jesse_> Hey guys. I have a site that uses Jquery and was wondering if you all know how I can get listed at http://docs.jquery.com/Sites_Using_jQuery. They have closed off editing due to to much spam but Im sure there are some that have the privileges to edit the page? Any ideas?
[09:22:18] <orl> oh, but $ is assigned to jQuery, as $.each works for other functions. Actually, I had the problem at the beginning as I wrongly placed my script in the headers (too early)
[09:22:23] <orl> but now, don't have any error
[09:22:43] <orl> and, actually, if it works with Firebug execution utility, it means that $ is jQuery, isn't it?
[09:22:47] <bbttxu> orl: can you show your code? i had a time where i moved all my script tags to the bottom of the page, but had inline js from templates that depended on libraries that were inserted _after_ the code that used those libraries... that sort of thing
[09:22:50] <orl> this script is the last one I "load"
[09:22:59] <Vorspire> orl, it's a "just in case" factor :D
[09:23:05] <orl> Vorspire: OK.
[09:24:21] <delinquentme> So im interested in testing the load times of the jquery on my pages .. is there a good tool for this
[09:24:30] <afink> Vorspire: dialog works well for what I needed also
[09:24:55] <orl> bbttxu: it's based upon a spip CMS
[09:26:01] <Jesse_> Hey guys. I have a site that uses Jquery and was wondering if you all know how I can get listed at http://docs.jquery.com/Sites_Using_jQuery. They have closed off editing due to to much spam but Im sure there are some that have the privileges to edit the page? Any ideas?
[09:26:04] <guy> guys help
[09:26:05] <guy> http://anuary.com/dev/hp/music/index.html
[09:26:09] <guy> why this doesn't work in IE
[09:26:31] <Vorspire> orl, so this script is in the <head> and loaded via <script src> and executes the code immediately upon loading? (just to clarify) Your code is using the document.ready handler function, are you SURE the elements your script is supposed to operate on even exist at the time of code execution? It wouldn't create any error if the selectors simply return nothing.
[09:27:02] <orl> bbttxu, Vorspire: here is the skel: http://pastebin.com/vZ7dt3pf, here is the inc-head.html skel: http://pastebin.com/DkWNy04p
[09:27:25] <orl> Vorspire: I'm sure the elements exist
[09:28:12] <orl> and as I wait for the document to be ready, I suppose they're here when mouseenter is triggered at first time
[09:28:35] <orl> bbttxu, Vorspire: I can paste the generated code, if you prefer
[09:28:47] <Vorspire> orl, is it normal to use <script><script</script></script> ?
[09:29:18] <orl> Vorspire: I would suggest it is not, but if you're talking about that History.js thing with jon object, this code comes straight from the plugin
[09:29:45] <Vorspire> orl sorry I noted it wrong because of the indentation lol
[09:30:00] <abes> Question: how would one go about creating a slide effect as in next to the NEW LOW PRICE banner on here http://www.ikea.com/ca/en ? thanks in advance!
[09:30:11] <orl> Vorspire: yeah, emacs and spip aren't always so much friends!
[09:30:17] <Vorspire> hehe
[09:30:18] <AGoat> If anyone has an idea on this http://forum.jquery.com/topic/validate-problem-either-or-but-not-both  I'd love to hear it!!
[09:30:46] <orl> Vorspire: but actually, it gives error in the w3c validator, and it's not so cool!
[09:31:57] <Vorspire> orl, I don't have any experience with the systems you're using, so I can't really decipher the code properly to give you a decent answer and I don't want to give you false positive answers :P
[09:32:11] <Vorspire> Because I'm not certain how those systems behave
[09:32:12] <orl> Vorspire: OK, I'll paste the generated code, then
[09:33:31] <dgouldin> dabear: figured it out if you're interested: http://dpaste.com/563354/
[09:34:20] <orl> Vorspire: not so easy....
[09:34:29] <orl> (to paste, I mean)
[09:43:03] <Camer0n> why wont this work http://vermilionsite.com/facebook/facebook.html i am trying to follow this tutorial http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/jquery-plugin-autoresize/ it should auto resize but it isnt
[09:45:08] <guy> can anyone share with me their best PNG IE fix?
[09:45:42] <kborchers> Camer0n: I would bet it is because you need to initialize your autoResize on dom ready. wrap your autoResize call in $(function() { .... }); and it will probably work.
[09:46:11] <Camer0n> aroung the entire thing?
[09:46:18] <kborchers> yep
[09:46:35] <Camer0n> yes! thank you!!
[09:46:39] <kborchers> np
[09:46:59] <Camer0n> hmm
[09:47:08] <Camer0n> it works but its acting strangely
[09:47:26] <Camer0n> it moves the whole thing up :/
[09:47:57] <Camer0n> not anymore! :/
[09:48:31] <Camer0n> oh wait,,,
[09:48:52] <Camer0n> oh its when i paste it faster than the animation lol
[09:50:09] <abes> Question: how would one go about implementing the following behaviour? http://i.imgur.com/TY9uL.jpg
[09:53:14] <abes> Great suggestions everyone! I will take them into consideration. But just before I leave, anyone else? ;)
[09:53:55] <Jesse_> Hey guys. I have a site that uses Jquery and was wondering if you all know how I can get listed at http://docs.jquery.com/Sites_Using_jQuery. They have closed off editing due to to much spam but Im sure there are some that have the privileges to edit the page? Any ideas?
[09:54:12] <coachz> Is there a way in jQuery to return all the contents of  <table id="table0">   ?   basically the entire table.
[09:55:07] <abes> coachz: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1036545/efficient-way-to-find-a-string-between-two-other-strings-via-javascript
[09:55:17] <kborchers> ?cycle @ abes
[09:55:17] <bot-t> abes, Cycle Plugin | jQuery Plugins - Easy to use slideshow implementation. It supports pause-on-hover, auto-stop, auto-fit, before/after callbacks, click triggers and many, many transition effects including fade, shuffle, scroll, turn... http://plugins.jquery.com/project/cycle
[09:55:51] <coachz> abes, how does that get the entire content of a table ?
[09:55:53] <abes> kborchers: thanks, but I need just one function out of it... ok, enough with all this lazyness... im going to write it...
[09:56:12] <abes> coachz: it gets the content in between your <table id="table0"> and </table> :D
[09:56:21] <coachz> oooooh thanks
[09:56:27] <abes> np
[09:56:59] <abes> coachz: a bit different approach, but you can use this as a base for your own getTable() function ;)
[09:57:35] <coachz> i don't really understand how they get a table contents with that link though
[09:57:42] <abes> coachz: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5874670/find-string-between-two-strings-in-javascript-or-jquery
[09:57:50] <Jesse_> does anybody know how I can get my jquery site listed on http://docs.jquery.com/Sites_Using_jQuery??
[09:59:23] <g0bl1n> what is the best way to set content to table cells, knowing their fixed position ?
[10:00:08] <kborchers> coachz: just do $("#table0").html()
[10:00:20] <coachz> thanks, i think that's more direct
[10:00:45] <g0bl1n> like $('.tablerow').last()._now_to_pick_3rd_cell ?
[10:02:06] <JAAulde> Hi all.  We have some UI Drag and Drop stuff that was working until recently...first drag/drop is fine, but second completely crashes IE.
[10:02:19] <coachz> worked great thanks
[10:02:29] <JAAulde> Turns out we have a code patch in place because of this UI bug: http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4333
[10:02:46] <JAAulde> That code patch came from: http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4333#comment:10
[10:03:19] <JAAulde> The milestone for that bug changed to 1.8.13, so I assume it is corrected...could that correction be causing the crash when running with the patch?
[10:04:28] <g0bl1n> ok, an each()
[10:05:09] <Matt`> is there anyway to get the location of an iframe if the iframe is viewing a different domain?
[10:06:36] <abes> Matt`: no, ive been trying to do that for a long time, but its a security issue, so its not possible
[10:07:32] <Matt`> it's really not though :/
[10:07:38] <Matt`> we can see the src="" in the first place
[10:07:45] <kborchers> JAAulde: most likely your patch is the issue. i actually fixed that bug by no longer checking the mouseHandled property of the original event and moving that check inside of mouse. Depending on what your workaround did, it was most likely broken by the bug fix
[10:08:38] <Nicolas_Leonidas> yo
[10:08:42] <Nicolas_Leonidas> isn't this correct? $("div#browserCookies").append('cadcasd');
[10:09:59] <kborchers> Nicolas_Leonidas: technicaly, yes depending on what you are trying to do and what is actually happening. see ?demo
[10:09:59] <bot-t> Nicolas_Leonidas, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:10:15] <AGoat> kborchers... you're a UI guy? Just a curiosity I've already worked around. I created a textarea with rows/cols set, in a page that loads JQUI... it automatically made that textarea resizeable, which is fine, but it also seemed to put a limit on the number of cols. I fixed it with an inline style:width. What's up with that?
[10:10:30] <Nicolas_Leonidas> I'm trying to add cadcasd to a div, defined as 	<div id="browserCookies"></div>
[10:11:40] <kborchers> Nicolas_Leonidas: that should work as you describe it. without seeing it not work (i.e. in a demo), it is hard to tell you what is wrong
[10:11:58] <delinquentme> .children should be a faster selector than .find right?
[10:12:01] <JAAulde> kborchers: ok--you did the bug fix?  cool--glad you're here!  I am removing our patch and testing.  Thanks
[10:12:28] <kborchers> delinquentme: in most cases, yes. you can check your situation at jsperf.com
[10:12:38] <Nicolas_Leonidas> http://jsfiddle.net/jgdcb/
[10:12:48] <Nicolas_Leonidas> I'm trying to show all the cookies in client
[10:12:58] <Nicolas_Leonidas> I want them to be added under that div
[10:13:19] <delinquentme> kborchers, yeahhh im messing with it right now .. but i cant seem to get to the part where it tells me the ops/sec .. its suspended in "pending"
[10:13:23] <abes> Question: is there a way to implement SLIDE on div's background? I know I can use JS to change the background position, but I doubt it will create a smooth sliding effect?
[10:13:31] <Inumedia> I'm having a bit of a weird issue.  I have a <div> with width:100% and overflow:hidden, yet when do $("#div").html("blah blah blah") and the string is longer then the width of the box, it expands it.  I don't want it to expand.  Anyone mind helping? :P
[10:14:15] <Inumedia> Not sure if it's a CSS issue or a jQuery issue or just a JS issue in general, but I can't figure it out. :<
[10:14:54] <abes> Inumedia: margin: auto, text-wrap: normal
[10:15:35] <kborchers> Nicolas_Leonidas: you are trying to append before the dom is ready. wrap your append code in $(function() { ... }); and it should work better
[10:15:46] <sagdfg> i have a bunch of thumbnails i load on my web page, and i set the src to an animated gif (so it's like still loading) then i set the onload to a function, that takes the this argument so i can reference the img tag and an url and sets the new src to some other image, and with firefox it works as expected, but IE blocks the UI until all the images are loaded so no "loading" effect
[10:16:03] <Inumedia> abes: Still happening.
[10:16:06] <sagdfg> what i'm trying to do is what this site has http://community.wacom.com/
[10:16:06] <sagdfg>  it's loading an animated gif for the thumb, then changes the thumbs src
[10:16:29] <kborchers> AGoat: i'm not sure of anything in jQuery UI that automatically makes your textareas resizable. Chrome does it by default but that is not a UI thing. see ?demo
[10:16:29] <bot-t> AGoat, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:16:50] <delinquentme> http://jsperf.com/child-vrs-find  << could someone correct this so it runs :D  .. its hella simple :D
[10:16:58] <AGoat> working on that now :)
[10:17:21] <Nicolas_Leonidas> gods damn!
[10:17:25] <Nicolas_Leonidas> kbu r right
[10:17:35] <Nicolas_Leonidas> kborchers*
[10:19:50] <AGoat> huh... can't reproduce it on jsfiddle... must be either fixed now or I have something else going on
[10:20:40] <AGoat> actually it *does* automatically make them resizeable, just doesn't have the width limit problem I was having
[10:20:43] <Jesse_> hey im sorry but does anybody know how I can get my website listed on http://docs.jquery.com/Sites_Using_jQuery?
[10:21:22] <AGoat> kborchers:  http://jsfiddle.net/Q3Uej/  Automatic application of resize to textareas
[10:23:10] <Jesse_> ughhh... I guess nobody knows
[10:23:21] <kborchers> AGoat: are you testing in Chrome or FF? those add the resize handles to your text areas. jQuery UI does not. If you open that in IE, there is no resize
[10:23:27] <Krinkle> delinquentme: the perf was broken, fixed now
[10:23:32] <Krinkle> http://jsperf.com/child-vrs-find/3
[10:23:42] <AGoat> ah ha.. it's FF the
[10:23:44] <AGoat> then
[10:25:12] <delinquentme> Krinkle, thanks! http://jsperf.com/child-vrs-find/4  are these results what you'd expect .. .find > .child?
[10:25:18] <Krinkle> delinquentme: find is faster in this case because it simply get's all elements with classname in the given context (context = $("#removed-shard-7114"))
[10:25:32] <Krinkle> whereas .children is slower because it needs to check if it is a direct child or not.
[10:27:18] <AGoat> Anyone with a thing for JQ validate around?  http://forum.jquery.com/topic/validate-problem-either-or-but-not-both
[10:28:05] <acidjazz> can someone anyone please tell em why this code 100% does not work in IE9 http://dev.postoffice.isobarlabs.com/jst/ww.js
[10:28:42] <acidjazz> SCRIPT5007: Object expected  ww.js, line 104 character 5
[10:35:29] <kborchers> AGoat: meant to tell you ealrier, if you are looking to have your textareas resizable, jQuery UI will do it for you, just not without actually making them resizable. http://jqueryui.com/demos/resizable/#textarea
[10:39:11] <delinquentme> anyone here experienced with "Yslow" ?
[10:39:14] <savid> Has anyone gotten datepicker to work with dynamically added fields?
[10:39:39] <AGoat> kborchers: Yes, I have looked at the docs, but in the situation I didn't care whether they were resizable or not, was just surprised to have it happen automatically b/c I didn't know FF would do it. I *did* have a problem with not being able to make a textarea wider than ~20 cols, but I can't reproduce that on jsfiddle. Many thanks for all your help today.

[10:40:09] <PERECil> is there a way to force the containment of a jquery element into another? i'm using a jquery draggable but it can sometimes pop out from the user's screens, and i'd like to replace it
[10:40:46] <kborchers> PERECil: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#option-containment
[10:41:08] <kborchers> savid: sure, what issue are you having? see ?demo
[10:41:08] <bot-t> savid, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:41:29] <PERECil> kborchers: i already use containement
[10:41:42] <PERECil> but it doesn't work when the user resize the window, for example
[10:42:53] <kborchers> PERECil: do you have an example?
[10:46:36] <Swams> May I ask someone to take a look at this link and tell me why my Fancybox gallery doesn't function properly (hi-res images don't pop up in overlay) http://cosmoprofnorthamerica.com/news_press/PhotoGallery.aspx
[11:03:16] <Jesse_> Can somebody please help me. I'm trying to figure out how to get my site listed on http://docs.jquery.com/Sites_Using_jQuery? Any help would be greatly appreciated
[11:05:12] <JAAulde> kborchers[A]: i removed the afore mentioned monkey patch, and IE7 still crashes on DnD interaction. :'(  Debugging some more...
[11:05:38] <savid> This is what is not working:    http://jsfiddle.net/G5f2a/
[11:06:25] <Jesse_> Can somebody please help me. I'm trying to figure out how to get my site listed on http://docs.jquery.com/Sites_Using_jQuery? Any help would be greatly appreciated
[11:06:43] <savid> Jesse_,  don't double post.  Be patient and someone will answer you if they have an answer.
[11:06:57] <Jesse_> oh, sorry
[11:07:59] <PERECil> kborchers[A]
[11:08:22] <savid> Jesse_, my guess is if they wanted people to be able to add their sites on their they would have had instructions on how to do so.  But now since just about _everyone_ uses jquery, I'd be  suprised if they'd be adding sites to that list unless they were well-known.
[11:08:58] <savid> Jesse_,  oh, actually looks like that list is editable.   why not  just add it yourself?
[11:09:04] <Jesse_> I see, it use to be open but people were spamming the page big time so they closed it from free editing
[11:09:23] <Jesse_> yes, it looks editable but once you login and go to the edit page it says the page is locked from editing...
[11:09:39] <savid> Jesse_,  well there you go, that's the answer to your question :-)
[11:10:03] <Jesse_> well once I had someone in here that has some admin privileges and he was gonna add one of my sites
[11:10:03] <mario-goulart> Hi. I quite frequently have cases like I want to get a numeric id of elements of the same class.  Usually the elements ids are programatically generated by prefixing numeric values with a string. Example:
[11:10:03] <mario-goulart> <span class="foo" id="id-1"> <span class="foo" id="id-2"> <span class="foo" id="id-3">
[11:10:03] <mario-goulart> What I usually do when I want an action to be performed on a, say, clicked element is something like that:
[11:10:03] <mario-goulart> $('.foo').click(function () { alert($(this).attr('id').replace(/id-/, '')); });
[11:10:08] <mario-goulart> Is there another way to do that?  Of course I could bind events handlers to each element id, but that sounds even worse.
[11:10:26] <Jesse_> savid but we decided against it since my site was using outdate jquery
[11:11:18] <Jesse_> savid I though maybe someone would be in here that had some type of admin privileges
[11:11:33] <savid> kborchers[A],  when you get back see if you can take a look at this:  http://jsfiddle.net/G5f2a/ .
[11:11:43] <Jesse_> savid thanks for looking into it, i'll maybe try back again later
[11:11:56] <ajpiano> Jesse_, what site did you want listed
[11:12:12] <ajpiano> is this that magic jack site again
[11:12:17] <Jesse_> savid http://www.youreviewit.com
[11:12:58] <lacrymology> is there a way of doing "or" filters?
[11:13:10] <z1000> how do I choose only one generation down of children?

[11:13:17] <ajpiano> lacrymology .filter(".foo,.bar")
[11:13:26] <lacrymology> ajpiano: thanks
[11:14:13] <z1000> #header li>ul>li>a vs #header ul>li>a - how can I make them operate independtly ?
[11:14:37] <z1000> I have a main nav and then drop down... want to give each different functions... am I missing something?\
[11:17:14] <ajpiano> Jesse_ give me a 5 word descriptoin of the site
[11:17:16] <ajpiano> or fewer
[11:17:20] <lacrymology> var inputs = jQuery(form).find('input'); inputs.filter(':text,:password,:textarea,:hidden').attr("value","");  << that last one returns everything, any clues?
[11:17:58] <ajpiano> what type of inputs don't you want ??
[11:18:05] <ajpiano> oh radios and checkboxes i guess
[11:18:12] <lacrymology> ajpiano: checkboxes, radios, and "submit" =P
[11:18:18] <ajpiano> ah
[11:20:07] <lacrymology> if I remove :textarea and :hidden, it works..
[11:20:47] <ajpiano> there is no :textarea
[11:21:29] <mjsilva> hi mates, is there any simple way to get the value in pixels of the size of a string?
[11:21:56] <mjsilva> I'm trying to mimic the efect of double clicking in a column separator of excel
[11:22:24] <mjsilva> where it expands to the size of the biggest row
[11:22:40] <beefman> i get this error in a civicrm install: c.ui.dialog is undefined       where is it supposed to be defined?
[11:22:44] <mjsilva> I'm lost on which is the best way to make this work
[11:23:02] <ajpiano> Jesse_: ?
[11:23:07] <Jesse_> ajpiano User Reviews Of Products
[11:23:10] <lacrymology> ajpiano: there's no ':select' either, apparently.. how do I look up which selectors work?
[11:23:16] <beefman> it's in jquery-ui-1.8.5.custom.min.js
[11:23:18] <Jesse_> ajpiano sorry.. trying to think of a 5 words or less
[11:23:25] <ajpiano> lacrymology: why would you need pseudos for select and textarea, which are just elements
[11:23:27] <Jesse_> ajpiano, then someone came to the door
[11:24:13] <ajpiano> Jesse_, i am considering getting rid of that page outright, but for the time being, you are there http://docs.jquery.com/Sites_Using_jQuery#Y
[11:24:27] <ajpiano> lacrymology: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[11:24:49] <Jesse_> ajpiano cool, thanks alot, i appreciate it
[11:26:11] <Jesse_> ajpiano that page use to be packed with spam in the past
[11:26:20] <Jesse_> ajpiano its a good thing its locked from editing now
[11:26:30] <ajpiano> Jesse_, i know...i manually cleaned all the spam off one day when i was finishing up at my old job
[11:26:48] <ajpiano> clicked on every single link there
[11:27:19] <skript> anyone know how to check and see if an item have a bound event?
[11:27:38] <Jesse_> ajpiano thanks again, i appreciate being added to the list, everything helps
[11:28:38] <Putr> hey is there a list of the most awsome/most used/best jquery plugins? only now have i discovered jQuery tools and i dont whant to miss something more.
[11:28:42] <ajpiano> welx
[11:31:30] <ajpiano> putr there are a lot of different blog sites and lists - we are working on building a new official plugins site that will make it clearer which are good suites of tools and which are one off antiquated old stuff
[11:32:13] <Putr> ye that would be awsome. Cuz jquery is .. well awsome, and there are a lot of awsome plugins outthere. It's a shame it's hard to find them ATM
[11:32:24] <v_v_vishnevskiy> http://goo.gl/gQeE0
[11:34:00] <Guest90348> anyone answer a beginner jquery question please:  in a ajax callback function, what syntax to use a selector on the jqHXR.responseText ?
[11:34:29] <beefman> any ideas for why c.ui.dialog is undefined?
[11:34:35] <Guest90348> I want to see find the value of a particular <div> in the responseText
[11:34:37] <systemfault> Guest90348: You can't use selectors on text, create a node from it
[11:35:36] <ajpiano> Putr: i think this site is kind of overwhelming, but it's a decent resource for sure http://jquerylist.com/
[11:35:50] <systemfault> Guest90348: I haven't tried but I'd probably do: var node = $('<div />'); node.html(jqHXR.responseText); then use selectors on node
[11:36:11] <ajpiano> or just $(data) in the callback of the ajax

[11:45:18] <JAAulde> blasts and curses
[11:47:10] <lunks> How can I check if a form has a certain input with a 'something' id and return false if there isn't?
[11:47:30] <luckymatt> what do you mean a certain input?
[11:47:59] <lunks> luckymatt: check if a form has i.e. <input id="bla"> check if #bla is present on it
[11:48:09] <Cork[home]> lunks: $('input#something').length > 0
[11:48:35] <luckymatt> Cork[home]: that would tell you if that input exists in the DOM
[11:48:38] <lunks> I wanted something less hackish, isn't there a jQuery method that returns false?
[11:48:52] <Cork[home]> lunks: thats as unhacky as it get
[11:49:02] <Cork[home]> thats the jquery way of doing it
[11:49:23] <Putr> I love anyone and everyone who had anything to do with getting jQuery Tools Form Validation into exsistance. I used to writed dozens of lines of code. Now 1 line is all it takes
[11:49:39] <luckymatt> what about $('input').is('#something')
[11:49:54] <Cork[home]> luckymatt: thats a lot slower
[11:50:10] <luckymatt> Cork[home]: yup, but it's less hacky if lunks wants that...
[11:50:10] <skript> does anyone know how to check to see if an item has an event bound to it
[11:50:39] <Cork[home]> luckymatt: but finding all input fields and then selecting on the id... is just... nuts...
[11:51:03] <luckymatt> Cork[home]: true, what about $('input#something').is('input')?
[11:51:14] <lunks> luckymatt Cork[home] ideally, it would be $('#myForm').has('.niceInput')
[11:51:15] <savid> Vorspire, wut
[11:51:16] <bot-t> (6 mins 58 secs ago) <Vorspire> tell savid http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/2nS8n/
[11:51:17] <luckymatt> Cork[home]: that would only go through the ODOM once
[11:51:25] <Cork[home]> luckymatt: i would buy $('#something').is('input')?
[11:51:29] <beefman> anyone have any ideas about what might cause c.ui.dialog is undefined?
[11:51:41] <Cork[home]> luckymatt: thats about as fast as it gets
[11:51:46] <beefman> i mean where is it supposed to be defined?
[11:52:14] <luckymatt> lunks: well there you go, that's the least hacky solution we can come up with!
[11:52:22] <Cork[home]> luckymatt: but still slower then length ;)
[11:53:12] <lunks> luckymatt: thank you!
[11:54:28] <savid> Vorspire,  yeah, the thing I forgot to mention is that I don't want to have to change the code that adds the new fields, as that's part of  a  third-party lib, and is not specific to date fields.   If there was some event I could hook into when the fields were added, that'd help.
[11:55:20] <Vorspire> ahh, show me the code you don't want to change, savid
[11:55:27] <Vorspire> single it out
[11:56:28] <Putr> any recomendations for a jquery autocomplete plugin?
[11:56:34] <Putr> (if i can even ask that)

[12:03:50] <leotr> hi! i want to add close button to the right top corner of div, and tried the following code: .position({my: 'top right', at: 'top right', of: train}) (train is div element). But the button appears in top left. Am i doing something wrong?
[12:05:33] <jeffsmykil> Is there a good way to solve the flickering pop up problem that arrises when using mouseenter and mouseleave
[12:06:20] <ColonelKurtz> Host do i use NickServ to kick off somebody else that's using my nick?
[12:06:27] <ColonelKurtz> how do i use*
[12:06:34] <Zerxer> say /msg nickserv ghost name password
[12:06:38] <jeffsmykil> you could do /nickserv help
[12:07:05] <jeffsmykil> the problem that I am having is that the popup sometimes overlaps the link it's being spawned from
[12:07:11] <jeffsmykil> creating flickering
[12:07:24] <jeffsmykil> between being shown and not shown
[12:13:03] <jjb123> Hey everyone, I was hoping to get some help with a simple problem I'm having. http://pastebin.com/1mS3b3i2 Whenever I run this, the ajax call works perfectly but temp_domain never gets reassigned (if I print out temp_domain inside of .$get it works but if I do it in the same scope as the original it keeps the same value). Any help with this would be appreciated!
[12:14:48] <savid> Vorspire, http://jsfiddle.net/G5f2a/11/
[12:16:54] <savid> Vorspire,  If there's some event that's fired when nodes are added to the DOM, I could just plug into that.  Just not sure what that event would be.
[12:17:45] <Vorspire> savid, would it not be good enough to to detect the code that can't be changed and remove it from the events?
[12:20:45] <savid> Vorspire, not sure what you mean by "Detect the code".
[12:21:30] <savid> I mean, if there was a way to "detect" when that code is inserting nodes,  that would help.  I just don't know how.
[12:22:03] <Vorspire> well, simply unbind the click event for #newField button if the "code that cannot be changed" has been bound
[12:24:02] <savid> Oh, you're saying unbind and use .live()  or  something?
[12:25:06] <Hierofant> Hi all. OT question for commercial developers in the USA about pricing.  What's best #?
[12:25:39] <savid> Oh, you mean on the add button.  Yeah, I suppose I could do that.
[12:26:30] <Vorspire> savid; http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/G5f2a/12/
[12:27:06] <Vorspire> as long as the code I wrote executes afterwards, it will hotfix the bind
[12:27:15] <Vorspire> monkey patch right? :D
[12:28:36] <Putr> hey what would be the purose of  jQuery(function(){ ... });     ?
[12:29:00] <Vorspire> short-hand for document.ready
[12:34:55] <Putr> Vorspire: wow that... wow :)
[12:35:22] <Vorspire> Putr what? Oo
[12:35:54] <Putr> what a weird shorthand for codument.ready
[12:36:59] <Vorspire> actually it's easier to do $(function(){ });
[12:37:48] <Vorspire> but then you have to wrap it with an immediately executing function that halps it define $ as jQuery - common when writing plugins
[12:37:54] <Cradam> hi can anyone tell me why jquery isnt working in ie7?
[12:38:07] <systemfault> Cradam: It does, you have a problem :/
[12:38:19] <Cradam> http://www.bromsgroveprinting.com/ the slideshow doesnt work
[12:38:30] <Cradam> havent as yet tested ie8
[12:38:38] <Cradam> but will do tomorrow
[12:39:46] <Cradam> systemfault: my slideshow works in all the other browsers
[12:40:14] <systemfault> Cradam: AFAIK, jQuery doesn't bundle a slideshow plugin.
[12:40:23] <Cradam> no it is cycles
[12:40:49] <dan-work> How do I access iframes that are dynamically created, like Facebook dialogs?
[12:41:02] <systemfault> Cradam: Does cycles support IE7?
[12:41:04] <Cradam> i am planning on setting an if lteie7 hide the slideshow div
[12:41:11] <Cradam> systemfault: it doesnt say
[12:41:19] <Cradam> *lte ie7
[12:41:53] <systemfault> Cradam: 2 seconds, booting the VM :P
[12:44:49] <delinquentme> if i've got a CSS :hover class on an object .. and i call a .trigger('mouseenter') on that object .. the object should respond with the established CSS :hover state right?
[12:45:07] <systemfault> No
[12:45:12] <systemfault> They're unrelated.
[12:45:51] <systemfault> At least, AFAIK.
[12:46:50] <delinquentme> oh!
[12:47:06] <delinquentme> so theres no way to trigger a CSS hover class by using trigger?
[12:47:48] <Swams> May I ask someone to take a look at this link and tell me why my Fancybox gallery doesn't function properly (hi-res images don't pop up in overlay) http://cosmoprofnorthamerica.com/news_press/PhotoGallery.aspx
[12:47:52] <systemfault> Cradam: I found the problem
[12:47:56] <shesek> delinquentme, no. that's something the browser does, you have no way to control that
[12:48:00] <systemfault> Cradam: You made a small mistake.
[12:48:22] <systemfault> Cradam: You there?
[12:48:33] <delinquentme> shesek, the browser controls what the mouse over CSS state?
[12:48:36] <shesek> delinquentme, the best you can do is use both a regular CSS class and ':hover' in your selectors, something like '.foo:hover, .foo.hover { color: blue; }', than add that CSS class
[12:49:45] <delinquentme> gotya
[12:50:18] <Cradam> systemfault: back

[12:51:21] <MetaJake> I do not understand  that when I link to the jqueryui base stylesheet at googleapis.com it will not be over-rided by inline styling. But when I link to the same exact stylesheet from my own server, it can be over-rided by inline styling. Might anyone suggest why that might be?
[12:51:28] <systemfault> Cradam: look at the line where you declare effect: 'fade', there an extra , at the end
[12:51:51] <Cradam> ?
[12:52:35] <systemfault> Cradam: At the end of line 18, there's a colon that should not be there..
[12:52:55] <systemfault> Cradam: If you don't understand at this point.. I don't know what to tell you.
[12:52:56] <Cradam> ok loading ub filezilla on this shit connection
[12:53:40] <Cradam> so just remove the extra , and :?
[12:53:50] <systemfault> Just remove the extra ,
[12:53:55] <systemfault> It should work on IE7
[12:54:19] <systemfault> Not sure what's special.. that's the problem.

[12:55:54] <Cradam> :)
[12:56:30] <Cradam> i guess firefox auto corrects this error

[12:59:39] <Cradam> systemfault: i cant test on my clients comp because i installed IE8 on their this morning
[12:59:45] <Dykotomee> Or is there a more elegant way besides "method probing" or whatever it's called?
[13:00:08] <systemfault> Cradam: Liar, you can just press F12 et click on the IE7 mode
[13:00:16] <Jayflux> Dykotomee you could use your console
[13:00:19] * Cradam facepalms
[13:00:26] <Dykotomee> Umm, no.
[13:00:30] <systemfault> Cradam: But it works fine here :)
[13:00:31] <Dykotomee> I need to do this programmatically.
[13:00:37] <Cradam> :D
[13:00:48] <Cradam> systemfault: you wouldnt by any chance have ie6?
[13:00:59] <Dykotomee> I want to pass either a variable OR a $el.
[13:01:02] <systemfault> Cradam: I don't
[13:01:13] <systemfault> Cradam: We only support IE7 and later at work
[13:01:20] <Cradam> no problem my client doesnt care much about IE anyway
[13:01:46] <Cradam> thanks bye
[13:03:06] <dan-work> Anybody know what I am doing wrong here http://dpaste.com/563443/ ?
[13:04:25] <quackquack> Does anyone know where i can find a map of `event.which` for every key?
[13:06:17] <MetaJake> dan-work, i am not sure exactly, but maybe it is because there is no html content inside that iframe
[13:06:58] <dan-work> MetaJake, There is. So should work right?
[13:07:35] <systemfault> dan-work: You cannot access the content of an iframe that is not on your website afaik due to SOP
[13:08:05] <jjb123> I'm having some trouble with .remove(). Whenever I use it it only seems to be changing the display to none instead of actually removing the element. Any suggestions?
[13:10:28] <dan-work> systemfault, Is there any workaround to that? Because the html is right there in the div tag
[13:11:04] <systemfault> No workaround at all.
[13:11:13] <systemfault> And it's there for your own security.
[13:12:19] <dan-work> damn, too bad. thanks
[13:14:11] <Hierofant> ajpiano
[13:14:13] <Hierofant> you around?
[13:14:51] <ajpiano> wassup
[13:15:19] <Hierofant> need some help on something related to jq but not really, in our fair city... can I /msg?
[13:20:53] <jjb123> Is it possible to specify which elements to remove based on the value of the "value" attribute?
[13:23:39] <erichynds> yeah bro
[13:23:58] <erichynds> $('[value="foo"]').remove()
[13:35:20] <jeffsmykil> So I have a .change() function and in IE 7 it requires the checkbox to be completely toggled once before working
[13:35:28] <jeffsmykil> has anyone run into this problem before
[13:35:43] <Michael> Completely toggled?
[13:35:48] <Michael> How can it be not completely toggled?
[13:35:56] <jeffsmykil> on then off
[13:36:02] <jeffsmykil> and then on again
[13:36:05] <jeffsmykil> before it works
[13:36:52] <Michael> That's not normal
[13:37:08] <jeffsmykil> i tend not to ask questions about normal behavior
[13:37:56] <kborchers[A]> jeffsmykil: i would imagine it has to do with the way you are checking the "checked" status of the checkbox. see ?demo
[13:37:56] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:38:08] <jeffsmykil> heh
[13:38:11] <jeffsmykil> i think ifound my issue
[13:38:17] <jeffsmykil> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/208471/getting-jquery-to-recognise-change-in-ie
[13:38:55] <jeffsmykil> my issue is that IE is tremendously lame
[13:39:00] <ekkis> anyone around that has used jquery.cycle.js?
[13:42:15] <jonabbey> no
[13:42:34] <jonabbey> anyone used the jquery.window plugin?  i'm having issues with it in our app
[13:43:22] * ekkis shakes head
[13:43:49] <jeffsmykil> if i do that my brains rattle around
[13:44:09] <smplstk> ekkis: yes
[13:44:30] <ekkis> smplstk: I had an issue with it but I figured it out
[13:44:40] <smplstk> OK, glad to be of service!
[13:45:05] <jeffsmykil> you should get a rubber duck ekkis
[13:45:07] <ekkis> heh
[13:45:13] <smplstk> ekkis: FYI, pretty much everything you could ever do with that plugin is documented on malsups page
[13:45:56] <ekkis> this was my issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3686459/jquery-cycle-how-to-change-transition-effect-on-a-running-slideshow
[13:46:29] <ekkis> hei... does anyone know if there's an event issued when an item is added to a <ul>?
[13:46:50] <imsky> no
[13:46:58] <imsky> dom mutation is pretty difficult to grab cross-browser
[13:47:08] <ekkis> pity
[13:47:19] <smplstk> ekkis: so 'scrollHorz' fixed everything for ya?
[13:47:28] <ekkis> complicates matters
[13:47:35] <ekkis> smplstk: yes, that's what I needed
[13:48:12] <ekkis> I had been trying to change the effect whilst the plugin was running but it's not designed to do that
[13:48:29] <smplstk> nope.
[13:48:54] <smplstk> ekkis: here's some more info if you feel like reading: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/options.html
[13:48:58] <djQuery>  .seen geekbuntu
[13:49:04] <smplstk> oh, look at all those pretty options.
[13:49:06] <imsky> ekkis: fwiw, http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/
[13:49:23] <imsky> IE is the big pain in the ass for dom mutation, but everyone else can handle it
[13:49:32] <ekkis> smplstk: yes, well familiar with that page
[13:49:54] * ekkis reads imsky's link
[13:50:14] <jeffsmykil> can you pre-load images that are being called from a CSS file?
[13:50:21] <jeffsmykil> as background-images
[13:51:08] <djQuery> anyone wanna give me a hand testing this? http://jsbin.com/edifi3/edit
[13:51:52] <jeffsmykil> seems to work
[13:51:55] <jeffsmykil> in IE 9
[13:52:42] <jeffsmykil> and IE 7
[13:52:53] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: seems to work in IE 9 and IE 7
[13:53:34] <ekkis> imsky: the tables don't include IE 9
[13:53:41] <imsky> that's true
[13:53:47] <imsky> dominserted works in ie9
[13:54:02] <ekkis> I guess I'd have to test... I wonder how much one need worry about pre 9 IE browsers out there
[13:54:21] <imsky> considering they're roughly 30-50% of the market...
[13:54:57] <imsky> ekkis: here's a fiddle demonstration: http://jsfiddle.net/davidThomas/f6e2T/
[13:55:02] <imsky> just tested in ie6, no alert
[13:55:12] <imsky> chrome, firefox, and ie9 all alert, however
[13:55:36] <ekkis> awesome
[13:56:08] <ekkis> well... maybe I'll just issue a warning for the older IE users that they should upgrade or the site will just fail
[13:56:13] <imsky> lol
[13:56:26] <Zerxer> who cares about IE6
[13:56:28] <ekkis> the failure won't be catastrophic
[13:56:32] <ekkis> yeah really
[13:56:41] <Zerxer> http://www.ie6countdown.com/
[13:56:48] <ekkis> even 7 is really ancient
[13:57:15] <imsky> well be that as it may, ekkis: http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=43&qpcustom=Microsoft+Internet+Explorer+8.0&sample=34
[13:57:19] <systemfault> IE7 won't be a problem IMHO.
[13:57:31] <djQuery> Zerxer: http://saveie6.com
[13:57:35] <systemfault> Because IE7 == Vista and not a lot of companies upgraded to Vista.
[13:57:42] <jjb123> Hey everyone, I'm having a problem I was hoping to get some help with. I'm trying to use .remove() to remove an element on a page but all it does is set display: none instead of actually removing it. Any suggestions?
[13:58:03] <Zerxer> lol djQuery :(

[14:03:05] <hardddisk> });
[14:03:07] <hardddisk>   I would like to call this mathod after the page is loaded by clicking anther link how can I do that
[14:03:08] <hardddisk> hope you all do not consider me a spamer
[14:03:10] <ryanneufeld> that means I'm the center of the univers

[14:03:29] <hardddisk> ryanneufeld, sorry will do mediately

[14:03:35] <ekkis> 30% of the market
[14:03:41] <imsky> ekkis: it doesn't work on ie8
[14:04:42] <ekkis> so 30% failure rate for me
[14:04:50] <ekkis> I guess I'll live with it - heh
[14:05:01] <imsky> get some stats on your visitors first
[14:05:09] <juha___> ryanneufeld: my mind just shat bricks
[14:05:11] <hardddisk> here is my paste http://fixee.org/paste/jhu4yqk/
[14:05:23] <imsky> ie makes up only 10% of my visitors
[14:05:34] <skrewt> my ie users are redirected to google.com/chrome
[14:05:35] <hardddisk> my question still how to call the function that is jQuery with onclick atributed situated on a link
[14:05:39] <skrewt> so they make up 0% of my traffic
[14:05:52] <juha___> my ie users are hipsters
[14:05:54] <imsky> skrewt: i bet they enjoy that
[14:06:20] <skrewt> hardddisk, wrap your function in a javascript function call
[14:06:27] <skrewt> like function functionName() {
[14:06:36] <skrewt> and then call it like onClick="functionName();"
[14:06:45] <skrewt> i literally just wrote this same thing on a site 10 minutes afo
[14:06:50] <skrewt> ago*. project im working on
[14:07:01] <ekkis> imsky: mine will be corporate users so I'm guessing it will be much higher
[14:07:02] <skrewt> oh wait
[14:07:03] <hardddisk> skrewt, what do you mean wrap the entire code?
[14:07:06] <skrewt> i can fix it there
[14:07:07] <ekkis> corporate and American
[14:07:10] <skrewt> hardddisk, 1 sec :)
[14:07:18] <hardddisk> okay skrewt
[14:07:30] <imsky> ekkis: yep, i'd say about half for you
[14:07:34] <imsky> if not more
[14:07:47] <imsky> i see IT people using ie as well
[14:08:03] <ekkis> it's not really a matter of choice
[14:08:06] <skrewt> hardddisk, http://fixee.org/paste/jhu4yqk/#url=ipcjija
[14:08:17] <imsky> ekkis: in an environment with firefox available? ;)
[14:08:28] <ekkis> large organisation lock shit down and autocratically determine the browser you get to use for "support" reasons
[14:08:39] <ekkis> like they provide support to their users :)
[14:08:49] <ryanneufeld> juha___: "Silly hipster, those jeans are your sisters"
[14:08:49] <skrewt> hardddisk, im leaving work but its only a 2 minute drive. message my other nick, skroot, and ill help out when im home

[14:09:33] <ekkis> imsky: I've fought that war at every client for the last 10 years
[14:09:54] <imsky> ekkis: haven't had much trouble having cross-browser code
[14:10:08] <imsky> it's corner cases like dom mutation that really make it painful

[15:26:07] <ipwa> evan luck, thx, that's what I want to do, can you recommend any tutorial or doc pages where I can ready about swapping the source of an image?

[15:33:23] <enndigg> hi everyone, wondered if u could help me with one issue: I load content of a div with  $.get() method, everything is fine as long as request is authenticated,but once authentication cookie times out $.get() method loads my login page into the div, is there a way to follow that login page redirection (something like window.location.replace()) pelease?
[15:35:56] <evan_luck> ipwa: np, hope that one helps
[15:36:43] <evan_luck> enndigg: maybe check the status code of the $.get return for a redirect?
[15:36:57] <enndigg> like throuugh xhr ?
[15:37:28] <enndigg> is there a way to see what was the destination of the redirect ?
[15:40:00] <evan_luck> hmm not sure about checking the destination
[15:41:37] <evan_luck> enndigg: checkout http://stackoverflow.com/questions/199099/how-to-manage-a-redirect-request-after-a-jquery-ajax-call

[15:48:30] <g0bl1n> what's the opposite of removeAttrib() ?
[15:48:41] <jeffmess> Hi. Does anyone know of a plugin to move a div to the top of a bunch of divs/reorder the divs by date or something? Preferably with a smooth animation?
[15:49:07] <enndigg> u can set it with attr('title', yourValue) afaik
[15:50:23] <evan_luck> g0bl1n: enndigg is correct, you can just set it with .attr('title', yourValue)
[15:50:37] <g0bl1n> enndigg, evan_luck thanks ;)
[15:50:53] <evan_luck> np
[15:51:29] <evan_luck> g0bl1n: you can set any attribute with that method too, even non-standard stuff like .attr('are-we-awesome', 'yes we are') BTW

[16:02:39] <leotr> i want fields, labels, buttons look nice
[16:03:07] <leotr> there are themes in jquery ui
[16:03:17] <leotr> but i can't find how to apply it
[16:04:13] <styol> jsaxey: this is a guess so prolly wont work but maybe something like if ($('#elem:focus").length != 0) { }
[16:04:28] <jsaxey> styol, that might work...testing
[16:04:28] <jsaxey> thx
[16:05:01] <evan_luck> leotr: i think there's a dedicated channel for jQuery UI
[16:05:06] <evan_luck> *think*
[16:06:00] <leotr> ok
[16:06:02] <leotr> thx
[16:06:44] <jsaxey> styol, u rule. that worked. thx! is this a jQuery bug that .is(":focus") doesn't work?

[16:10:15] <Glutnix> should I ask jquery ui questions here, or in #jquery-ui ?
[16:18:14] <evan_luck> Glutnix: I assumed the jQuery UI channel was for UI but this looks like the place
[16:21:13] <zi> Any ideas how could I get the 'latest' jQuery out of google's library API?
[16:21:46] <BinaryKitten> zi yep
[16:21:55] <BinaryKitten> in the version number.. use 1
[16:22:22] <zi> Oh, neat. :]
[16:22:25] <zi> Thanks. <3
[16:31:39] <coreyo> I noticed that using the .show() with any type of animation adds/overrides a lot of style="" parameters that don't get cleared after the element is shown (most notably, the overflow parameter).  What is the best way to deal with this so that it does not override the overflow parameter set in the .css file?
[17:00:44] <Glutnix> With a ui draggable, it seems that hiding the draggable on create prevents its activate event from triggering... help!
[17:00:49] <Caraes_Naur_> is there a way to see if $.validate() has been called on a form?

[17:19:15] <Glutnix> Es0teric: is it that line 18 and 19 are split?
[17:19:43] <Es0teric> glutnix, yes they are split
[17:19:59] <Glutnix> shouldn't search_term be all on one line? ;)
[17:20:08] <Glutnix> is that your error?
[17:20:31] <SinnerNyx> Hello, JQ noob here. I've found an html select element using the $() selector. I have the index of the option that I want selected. How would I go about selecting that particular option?
[17:20:51] <Es0teric> glutnix, my error is that the page looks like theres no javascript enabled...
[17:21:08] <Es0teric> so i have a couple of things hidden via js, but they are showing right now
[17:22:43] <DofLeFou> I m trying to solve a little dillemme ... I have a grid table in which i can filter the row by column ... after the filtering the user can edit ... the edit happen on a Jquery modal dialog .... My issue .... when I do a submit on that the dialog, it reset my grid
[17:22:56] <Glutnix> Es0teric: what kind of errors you getting?
[17:23:00] <SinnerNyx> Es0teric: I missed the problem description, but whenever JS appears to not be working I immediately check if any JS errors come out
[17:23:24] <DofLeFou> is there a way a to submit a jqury dialog .... without having to reset the parent
[17:24:49] <Es0teric> sinnernyx, how do you check for any js errors/
[17:24:51] <Es0teric> ?
[17:24:58] <Glutnix> which browser you using Es0teric ?
[17:25:02] <SinnerNyx> Es0teric: depends on your browser
[17:25:08] <Es0teric> firefox, i have firebug installed
[17:25:17] <Glutnix> firebug should be giving you an error count
[17:25:41] <Glutnix> you have a comma after your if statement closing brace on line 25 of that pastie
[17:25:51] <SinnerNyx> I use Chrome and IE9. I don't actually know how to find errors in FireFox :S. sorrry, gl
[17:26:06] <SinnerNyx> I've found an html select element using the $() selector. I have the index of the option that I want selected. How would I go about selecting that particular option?
[17:26:22] <Glutnix> i think the comma and the dataType property are supposed to be outside the success function
[17:26:32] <Glutnix> ^-- those two for Es0teric
[17:26:53] <fourcolors> hey is there anything written in jquery that lets my contact form have text written inside of it and it disappears when you are clicking inside of the form but comes back when your not?
[17:27:14] <fourcolors> i don't know what thats called
[17:27:24] <Es0teric> glutnix, i erased the comma and still... nothing
[17:27:43] <Glutnix> Es0teric: try this: http://pastie.org/2169936
[17:28:27] <phrearch> hey
[17:28:28] <Glutnix> With a ui draggable, why does hiding the draggable on create prevents its activate event from triggering?
[17:28:46] <phrearch> how do i trigger a mouseout only when the mouse moves outside the outer element?
[17:29:01] <phrearch> now its triggered when hovering over child elements as well
[17:29:58] <Es0teric> glutnix, still nothing...
[17:30:12] <Glutnix> to find javascript bugs in chrome, View > Developer > Developer tools
[17:30:17] <phrearch> ah mouseleave fixes it
[17:30:18] <Glutnix> *errors
[17:30:58] <SinnerNyx> Glutnix: I mentioned chrome, but I think Es0teric is using firefox..
[17:31:12] <Glutnix> find javascript errors in firefox + firebug, enable the console tab
[17:31:15] <Es0teric> i am on a mac, PPC...
[17:31:31] <Es0teric> it doesnt support chrome... for chrome you need intel mac
[17:31:56] <Glutnix> find javascript errors in firefox + firebug, enable the console tab in firebug and an error count should appear in the footer
[17:32:01] <Glutnix> right, lunchtime in NZ
[17:32:05] <SinnerNyx> I've found an html select element using the $() selector. I have the index of the option that I want selected. How would I go about selecting that particular option?
[17:33:48] <SinnerNyx> $('#set-region') is a drop-down html element (select). How do I set the selected option to (for instance) 5? $('#set-region').options.selectedIndex=5; does not appear to work.
[17:40:09] <SinnerNyx> figured it out :D
[17:42:39] <kr> hello
[17:43:04] <kr> anybody?
[17:43:20] <jovrtn> hi
[17:45:11] <DofLeFou> Please help http://jsfiddle.net/NwuQR/
[17:45:38] <amites> Anyone have practice binding a button to an action from within a frame? I have a site where there is a thickbox pop-up with 2 buttons bound with .live() within the external html loaded (example at http://florida-insurance-lawyers) - however when the site is loaded in a frame the thickbox fires, though the bind to the buttons do not work without any error - pastebin at http://pastie.org/2169988
[17:45:38] <DofLeFou> i m trying to submit specific div on my page
[17:47:13] <jovrtn> DofLeFou: what does it mean to submit a div?
[17:47:49] <DofLeFou> jovtn: I have a div in my page
[17:48:31] <DofLeFou> what I m using to load into a dialog
[17:48:48] <amites> DofLeFou: is the bind for a specific event?
[17:49:57] <amites> DofLeFou: I'm thinking you may want to bind the div to an id and pull the values of the fields using jQuery
[17:50:11] <acidjazz> for the love of god can someone help me w/ this stupid ie9 bug thats been haunting me for days
[17:50:34] <DofLeFou> amites: http://jsfiddle.net/NwuQR/1/

[17:52:14] <kr> i need some jquery help. i want chek only parent not children. it's drag&drop function. it MUST work: if i drag parent-div, parent-div drags, children-div drags with him, but if  i drags children-div it and his parent not drags . it work: if i drag children-div it drags with his parent.
[17:53:11] <kr> how i can select only parent without children?
[17:54:28] <DofLeFou> amites: any idea what i m doing wrong there?
[17:54:49] <shesek> there's no reason that you would have to specifically handle that, if you're moving a DOM element around it'll move with his child nodes, no reason for it to effect the parents
[17:54:58] <shesek> (@kr ^)
[17:55:22] <shesek> what exactly are you using for the drag 'n drop functionality?
[17:55:32] <jovrtn> DofLeFou: what do you want to happen when someone clicks the 'okay' or 'submit' button on your dialog?
[17:56:51] <DofLeFou> submit .. i want it to do a save .. currently it is saving .. but the whole page refreshes
[17:57:32] <DofLeFou> seems like $('#comment form').submit(); is submitting the whole page
[17:57:45] <jovrtn> it would unless you have it submitting via ajax
[17:57:51] <jovrtn> which I don't see anywhere
[17:58:19] <DofLeFou> jovrtn: how would a rookie do that
[17:58:53] <jovrtn> there are plenty of guides out there on creating an ajax comment form
[17:59:04] <DofLeFou> ?
[17:59:22] <jovrtn> it's a little more involved than just telling you the functions you need
[17:59:52] <jovrtn> you'll need a server-side script to insert the comment into a database, etc
[18:00:13] <jovrtn> while using jquery's $.ajax to invoke that script on form submission
[18:00:59] <DofLeFou> i have that server side function that add the comment to the db
[18:01:47] <DofLeFou> i m actually dealing with a table grid
[18:02:22] <DofLeFou> and in that table each row have an image button
[18:02:47] <DofLeFou> that when click ... load that comment dialog
[18:03:31] <DofLeFou> it is different as you may thing I have a regular form and needs to add comments
[18:10:39] <abjorn> http://bitmagnet.org/ best site or best site?
[18:25:02] <Glutnix> Anyone know why with a ui draggable, why hiding the draggable on create prevents its activate event from triggering?
[18:58:39] <Qiller> hi, can i post hash in url using jquery ?
[19:06:46] <Qiller> jquery support is dead.
[19:06:52] <Qiller> bye zombies
[19:09:19] <comboy> MOOAR BRAINZZ
[19:16:16] <iszak> waited like 8 minutes ha
[19:16:34] <iszak> I guess expected real time support, for free, all the time, 24/7, including christmas.
[19:17:57] <Prometheus> jquery support?
[19:17:59] <Prometheus> wtf
[19:18:10] <Prometheus> maybe he didn't read the sign on the door
[19:18:15] <Prometheus> 9am-5pm
[19:18:18] <Prometheus> mon-sat
[19:18:31] <iszak> but in which time zone?
[19:19:45] <Prometheus> the one and only timezone that matters
[19:19:59] <Prometheus> (I'm not sure which one that is, but obviously not his)
[19:20:03] <iszak> UTC?
[19:20:14] <Prometheus> let's say it's UTC
[19:20:19] <Prometheus> for the sake of argument
[19:20:37] <iszak> no way, it's UTC + 8, the time zone China is on.
[19:23:47] <Prometheus> fuck china
[19:25:16] <systemfault> Yeah!
[19:25:24] <systemfault> Fuck china and their IE6
[19:25:26] <systemfault> :(
[19:35:04] <Glutnix> if it's not work hours in the US, this place seems to be full of lurkers
[19:44:42] <blueadept> is it a better strategy to just do everything in 1 shot for mozilla/gecko and worry about ie once everything has been completed? or try to work out the ie kinks en route?
[19:44:59] <blueadept> ie is fucking unbelievable
[19:45:16] <systemfault> Depends on what version you must support..
[19:45:22] <blueadept> they're purposely hurting innovation
[19:45:30] <systemfault> There are some things that you must know upfront.
[19:45:49] <blueadept> go on
[19:45:55] <blueadept> i mean i can do it
[19:46:02] <blueadept> but jez
[19:46:05] <systemfault> :/
[19:46:12] <systemfault> We all share that pain..
[19:46:19] <systemfault> Well, perhaps not all... but most of us
[19:46:19] <blueadept> IE MUST BE DESTROYED
[19:46:27] <systemfault> IE10 will be fine :P
[19:46:29] <blueadept> at all costs
[19:46:34] <systemfault> Even IE9 is fine
[19:46:41] <blueadept> ie9 is still buggy
[19:47:06] <blueadept> using tiptip here, with some so so jquery
[19:47:19] <blueadept> getting inconsistent results with ie9
[19:47:23] <systemfault> IE9 is damn standard IMHO
[19:47:24] <blueadept> not even consistent mind you
[19:47:49] <systemfault> Do you have an example :/
[19:48:01] <blueadept> meh can't really show
[19:48:03] <blueadept> but trust me
[19:48:13] <blueadept> safari/firefox/chrome are golden 1st run
[19:48:24] <blueadept> i go over to my ie9, and all hell breaks loose
[19:48:34] <systemfault> Since IE8, that's pretty much my experience to be honest..
[19:48:39] <systemfault> golden.
[19:49:28] <blueadept> i almost want to force all ie users to a special firefox download page
[19:49:31] <blueadept> and just accept the losses
[19:49:36] <blueadept> that's where i am right now
[19:49:57] <blueadept> i'm like google deciding to get out of china on this

[19:54:18] <Doonce> http://pduclothing.com/shop/full/make_dreams_not_war
[19:54:28] <Doonce> the buttonset is causing a horizontal scrollbar
[19:54:47] <Doonce> .ui-helper-hidden-accessible appears to be the culprit
[19:55:02] <Doonce> in safari
[19:57:05] <Doonce> might be css issue, but its jquery css so thought you could help
[19:59:20] <Doonce> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4623
[19:59:59] <Doonce> new version doesnt have left though..?
[20:00:36] <systemfault> The stupid radio button has a 100% width
[20:01:05] <Doonce> its in a section though
[20:01:10] <Doonce> so its 100% width of the section
[20:01:14] <systemfault> ...
[20:01:21] <systemfault> 100% width of the viewport.
[20:01:54] <Doonce> sh!t
[20:05:05] <Doonce> sorry aboot that
[20:05:14] <systemfault> It's cool
[20:13:04] <doncams> noob question. how do you get data from external json to be stored in a var? here's my code http://pastebin.com/a9AchZu6
[20:15:11] <ryanseddon> $.getScript
[20:16:14] <ryanseddon> or $.getJSON rather
[20:18:59] <doncams> ryanseddon, see pastebin
[20:19:13] <doncams> that doesn't work
[20:20:05] <ryanseddon> doncams: is it the same origin or are you calling from another domain?
[20:21:58] <doncams> same origin
[20:23:20] <ryanseddon> open up your dev tools in the browser and see if it's 404ing or something is going wrong with xhr call
[20:25:51] <doncams> no 404 error
[20:26:14] <doncams> it has the response
[20:28:03] <ryanseddon> I guess your myjson var isn't storing the returned data then
[20:28:33] <ryanseddon> if you try to access the json data within the callback does it work?
[20:29:13] <doncams> nope
[20:29:15] <doncams> wait
[20:42:49] <mnyon> Hi all, I had a quick question about IE and the submit() method. I know that the submit() event doesn't bubble up, so what's the best way to submit a (non-AJAX) form cross browser? Thanks
[20:48:28] <ryanseddon> Just trigger a submit event on the form element
[20:49:06] <EvanDonovan_work> how do i create a link inside an <iframe> that is being included inside a jquery ui dialog that would close the jquery ui dialog?
[20:50:07] <EvanDonovan> there is apparently the ability to have a X in the upper right hand corner of the dialog itself
[20:50:20] <EvanDonovan> so i am wondering if it is possible to have the iframe trigger the same action of closing the dialog
[20:50:43] <saddishwasher> EvanDonovan, there is some handler like this.parentWindow if I recall - left me try to find the syntax
[20:52:25] <EvanDonovan> thanks. from stackoverflow, i've found $('#terms').dialog('close'); but obviously that would only work from inside the parent.
[20:52:32] <EvanDonovan> i need somethiing that i can call from the child.
[20:52:33] <saddishwasher> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/726816/how-to-write-this-in-jquery-window-parent-document-getelementbyidparentprice
[20:52:36] <saddishwasher> I found that too
[20:53:01] <saddishwasher> that link will let you do things from the child
[20:54:06] <EvanDonovan> oh i see...the window.parent.document changes the context
[20:54:46] <saddishwasher> so yours would be $("#terms", window.parent.document).dialog("close");
[20:57:11] <DofLeFou> please help http://jsfiddle.net/NwuQR/3/
[20:57:20] <alexparker> i love jquery
[20:57:49] <alexparker> DofLeFou: Not sure what your question is
[20:58:07] <saddishwasher> agreed, what is the problem?
[20:58:29] <saddishwasher> ++alexparker for showing the love
[21:00:22] * alexparker twiddles thumbs
[21:00:37] <saddishwasher> DofLeFou, interesting placement of commas in your .dialog() function
[21:01:01] <alexparker> saddishwasher: probably so he can comment them out easily
[21:01:09] <alexparker> i've done that on occasion
[21:01:41] <djQuery> ok am I doing somethign wrong here or is the newest version tempaltes busted? http://jsbin.com/ucoquf/3/edit
[21:01:52] <djQuery> if I take out the child tempalte it works
[21:02:55] <saddishwasher> djQuery, sorry never used template before
[21:03:59] <djQuery> is this not the correct syntax for child templates? <tbody>${{tmpl(Columns) "#coltmpl"}}</tbody>
[21:05:52] <mnyon> ryanseddon: I've been doing that, but the challenge is that I need to make an AJAX call and have that returned before I submit the form. For some reason, this is not working as expected.
[21:06:19] <ryanseddon> djQuery: I don't think you need the $
[21:06:32] <ryanseddon> I did a project with nested templates and I just checked it and I have {{tmpl(extra) "#introTemplate"}}
[21:06:55] <djQuery> ryanseddon: thanks man
[21:07:36] <ryanseddon> mnyon: then do it in the success callback of the ajax call
[21:10:24] <djQuery> $('#myform').bind('myajaxcomplte', function(){ //do ajaxyyy submit here. });   $('myform').submit(function(){  code to check if form is valid;  $(this).trigger('myajaxcomplte');})});
[21:10:34] <djQuery> mnyon: ^
[21:10:59] <mnyon> djQuery: thanks, but this does not require AJAX, actually?
[21:21:19] <djQuery> anyone know how to grab a handle of the item while it is being dragged. I need to set a width on the cloned.
[21:21:19] <notjrbauer> does anyone know how to show the current visible item in jCaroselLite? :|
[21:21:46] <djQuery> if its visible isnt it allready shown?
[21:22:17] <notjrbauer> yeah but Im pretty new to jq and not sure how I would test that
[21:24:51] <djQuery> notjrbauer: see ?jqf
[21:24:51] <bot-t> notjrbauer, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[21:25:19] <djQuery> notjrbauer: most likely jCL is adding a specific css class to the specific item.
[21:25:30] <dssd_7> hey people...my jquery function contains some variables... how do i transfer them to my DB using php ?
[21:27:06] <dssd_7> http://pastebin.com/78siySyt        how do i save the variables label,width,height,...etc...in a DB ?
[21:27:26] <djQuery> dssd_7: errr see ?.ajax
[21:27:27] <bot-t> dssd_7, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[21:34:19] <djQuery> ques people are only going after easy questions tonight
[21:34:27] <robertor> hi guys! i was looking in jquery site for info about 1.4.2 and 1.6.2... there is compatibility between this 2 versions?
[21:34:52] <dssd_7> cant i just push the value into a hidden HTML form ?
[21:35:18] <robertor> ohhh i read that not :D
[21:49:56] <styol> dssd_7: depending on where or what you'd like to store the data on, you might setup for instance a server side php script to accept expected data to be saved into a mysql database in the expected format which you could indeed post back to the server with AJAX which will in a way replicate what an html form might do
[21:53:07] <martco> Please don't put JSON into a database cell
[22:16:11] <fourcolors> hey, how can I loop through every element in jquery in a form?
[22:16:21] <fourcolors> I need to loop through all of my text fiends in my form and disable them
[22:16:27] <fourcolors> but haven't been able to do that in jquery
[22:18:12] <martco> Set a specific class on the text fields
[22:18:27] <martco> And then loop through that c
[22:18:31] <martco> Class
[22:20:28] <martco> $('.foo').each(function ());
[22:22:40] <khmer> $('#theform input[type=text]').prop('disabled',true)
[22:31:06] <perverse> does anyone know if there is a flag to ascertain whether an item is being moved from a sorted list to a connected sorted list, or whether the item is moving within its own list?
[22:31:11] <perverse> (with jqueryui sortable)
[22:31:13] <perverse> ?
[22:34:02] <perverse> an event that is only triggered when an item is moving within its own list would be nice
[22:37:03] <smplstk> perverse, I'm sure you could write something to check with the given events
[22:37:29] <perverse> i can, it just seemed cleaner to ask if there was a more proper way
[22:37:56] <perverse> well can i... that's the quesiton i guess
[22:38:58] <perverse> yeah i think i can, lol
[22:39:04] <smplstk> you can use the stop event, and then check where the sortable is at that point.
[22:39:48] <perverse> that will trigger on both slots that are affected though, won't it?
[22:40:05] <perverse> i want to notify the user and revert at this point
[22:40:13] <perverse> basically that's all i want to do, pretty simple really
[22:40:55] <perverse> i've got a matrix of data in the script that gets checked against and should be a simple was this check successful? yes - allow sorting to occur. no - revert sort back to original state
[22:41:50] <perverse> and if the event is being triggers twice, the check will happen twice, the alert will happen twice, etc
[22:41:54] <perverse> but then
[22:42:06] <perverse> im still wrapping my head around the exactly event order and whatnot of this module
[22:42:14] <perverse> when and where the events trigger, etc
[22:51:34] <CuDi> homies

[22:51:46] <CuDi> am i missing something here: $('#mydiv').height($('#mydiv').contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight));
[22:59:20] <CuDi> had to resort to this which is sad. document.getElementById('CCPaymentiFrame').style.height = document.getElementById('CCPaymentiFrame').contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight+'px';
[23:00:00] <djQuery> perverse: it might be better to fire your event when the user drags to an invalid list to drop the item in. maybe change the color of the item.  over: function(e,ui){  do condition checking here. }, out: fucntion(e,ui){ undo invalid conditions }
[23:00:52] <sean`> ?contents @ CuDi

[23:03:03] <CuDi> but what was wrong with what i had im just curious
[23:06:40] <iszak> where is coldhead D:
[23:07:17] <djQuery> look around a little he is whering a striped shirt and hat
[23:07:27] <iszak> I've got a video for him
[23:08:24] <CuDi> lol
[23:08:57] <iszak> how is that funny?
[23:08:58] <iszak> HOW
[23:12:26] <aaairc> is there a way with toggle() to get it to swipe straight up and down... instead of the swipe emanating from the top left corner?
[23:12:48] <perverse> djQuery - can you elaborate on your suggestion?
[23:12:56] <perverse> actually wait
[23:12:59] <perverse> lemme think about it for a sec
[23:13:00] <perverse> lol
[23:14:09] <perverse> ok, i think i can abide that logic for my case, lets see if i can implement
[23:15:26] <perverse> actually no
[23:15:35] <perverse> im not sure if that's suitable
[23:15:56] <perverse> because if the conditions are met, then both of the sortables need to fire an ajax callback to update their states on the server side
[23:16:15] <perverse> but out and over are only going to fire on their respective sortables
[23:18:28] <perverse> the problem seems to be that i have this one set of logic that needs to be determined on a global basis, with all sortables taken into account... but each sortable needs to be smart enough to know that the move was successful on their own
[23:20:21] <perverse> i don't suppose there's anyone around anymore that has a clue what i'm on about? lol
[23:20:21] <thatryan> what was the plugin going around on twitter recently kind of like the Waypoints plugin?
[23:27:48] <aaairc> anyone in here familiar with isotope?
[23:31:21] <guest38549> I have 4 input elements on a page. I have a div with some text in it below those. The div is hidden at first. I'd like to show the div if any of the inputs receive focus and hide it if none of the inputs have focus. However, I don't want to hide and re-show the div when each element gains/loses focus. So, basically, when any of the inputs have focus show the div and maintain it being shown if any of the other inputs gain focus. I 
[23:31:24] <guest38549> Is this possible to do with jQuery?
[23:32:00] <gf3> guest38549: yes
[23:32:18] <SpaceghostC2C> I'm trying to work with this JSON to print out only the name content_file_name value and the id. http://pastie.org/2170951 I'm really lost right now.
[23:32:48] <guest38549> gf3: How might I achieve it?
[23:33:13] <CuDi> how do you set an event on callback of setting an iframe source
[23:33:37] <gf3> guest38549: var $myDiv = $( '#myDiv' ); $( '#page input' ).focus( function(){ $myDiv.show() } ).blur( function(){ $myDiv.hide() } )
[23:33:53] <ryanseddon> SpaceghostC2C: is that returned from a ajax call?
[23:34:03] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanseddon: Yes.
[23:34:29] <djQuery> guest38549: it will happen so fast they wont notice the hide show.
[23:35:13] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanseddon: I can get to the point where I have the object, but I don't know how to get to the elements inside it to use the content_file_name and id.
[23:36:38] <guest38549> Well, there is a problem with that like I said before. When I do it that way, the div is shown and hidden each time between each input focus/blur. I'm doing an animation to the div so it is noticeable. The div is faded in/out and has it's height expanded/collapsed. Sorry I didn't mention the animation before. Forgot to say that.

[23:41:12] <guest38549> gf3: djQuery: Thanks guys! I'll give it a try.
[23:48:25] <guest38549> gf3: djQuery: It seems to work just fine. Thanks again!
[23:50:49] <SpaceghostC2C> ryanseddon: Oh, that's rathe helpful. Thank you. I'm going to go fiddle and see if I can do what I'm trying to accomplish.
