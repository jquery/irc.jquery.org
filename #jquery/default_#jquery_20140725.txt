[00:42:09] <sammych> okay, what's the fastest templating engine?
[00:42:29] <sammych> I've seen the one here, but it's rather oudated http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote2/
[00:43:21] <sammych> should I just go with Underscore?
[00:44:01] <sammych> jquote2 templates can be imported as separate source js files
[01:16:58] <MACscr> If i have a site that uses jquery 1.11.0 and a third party script that i need to use on a single page uses 1.7.1, is there any way to use it just for that other script?
[01:26:28] <withoutaname> hello there
[01:27:40] <withoutaname> http://jsfiddle.net/8AFJx/ <- can someone explain to me why clicking on the text boxes don't work?
[01:32:11] <Uhkis> because <a> never ends
[01:38:12] <withoutaname> Uhkis: thanks, how would end the <a> tag while still tying it to the link on click
[01:41:18] <Uhkis> withoutaname: is there a reason for that really weird way to toggle that login div?
[01:41:54] <Uhkis> withoutaname: why not just make a display:none; div and then show() it on click?
[01:42:42] <withoutaname> thanks, that's a good idea
[01:47:21] <withoutaname> Uhkis: uh, actually, it's so people can remove the form if they want to
[01:48:14] <withoutaname> if it's set to display:none, the next time they click the link it won't be there
[01:48:27] <Uhkis> ?api toggle
[01:48:27] <b-ot> Uhkis: .toggle(): Display or hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[01:49:14] <Uhkis> withoutaname: use that for hide/show
[01:54:06] <Uhkis> withoutaname: http://jsfiddle.net/Q6WW4/
[01:57:42] <withoutaname> wow that's really concise
[02:17:27] <arisalexis> why this needs this.$('#actionButton').text("Get it!"); to work
[02:17:40] <arisalexis> and this needs [0] (this.$('#map-canvas')[0] to work
[02:18:02] <arisalexis> (second one is passed in a function that expects an htmlelement). i don't get the difference
[02:18:51] <decx> $() wraps something inside a jquery object
[02:19:24] <arisalexis> im using backbone and this refers to the view, it's important and i forgot
[02:19:26] <decx> [0] on that is the native element you would get with something like document.querySelector('.class')
[02:20:26] <arisalexis> the problem is that the first written like this$('#actionButton')[0].text('bla') produces error "string is not a function
[02:20:40] <arisalexis> but this is like running find and getting the first result right?
[02:20:50] <decx> yeah because the native version of #actionbutton doesnt have the text() method applied to it
[02:21:19] <decx> console.log($('#actionButton')) to see the content all the functions you can use
[02:21:42] <decx> inside the [0] is the native one with all the functions that can be used there
[02:22:20] <jumanji> anyone have experience with google chrome extension development?
[02:22:56] <arisalexis> ah ok now  i get it
[02:23:22] <arisalexis> im running a jquery function on a native object that's why
[02:23:29] <arisalexis> thank you
[02:36:10] <DinoRhino> Hi, how do I replace an XML node with an xml string?
[02:36:26] <DinoRhino> I've got
[02:36:26] <DinoRhino> var newNode = "<SomeNode>123</SomeNode>"
[02:37:09] <DinoRhino> $(xml).find("SomeNode")[0] contains the following: <SomeNode>abc</SomeNode>
[02:37:14] <DinoRhino> So my idea was to do this:
[02:37:41] <DinoRhino>  $($(xml).find("SomeNode")[0]).replaceWith(jQuery.parseXML(newFragment));
[02:38:22] <DinoRhino> but it doesn't seem to work. what am I doing wrong?
[02:39:27] <Uhkis> $('SomeNode').text('newtext') ?
[02:40:40] <DinoRhino> Looks like parseXML by default creates a document node around the xml element ..which then causes the following error when you try to insert it somewhere: HierarchyRequestError: Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': Nodes of type '#document' may not be inserted inside nodes of type '#document-fragment'
[02:41:00] <DinoRhino> thanks Uhkis
[02:44:53] <Hausas_> Why doesn't this work at all? $('<div class="schemaPath">' + binding + '</div>').insertBefore($(this).parent().parent()); $(this).parent().parent() returns proper div and binding is definitely not null
[02:46:09] <Uhkis> good god :D
[02:46:51] <Uhkis> ?api prepend
[02:46:51] <b-ot> Uhkis: .prepend(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[02:47:14] <Uhkis> ?api insertBefore
[02:47:15] <b-ot> Uhkis: .insertBefore(): Insert every element in the set of matched elements before the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertBefore/
[02:47:55] <Hausas_> I want to insert that <div class="schemaPath">' + binding + '</div> before .parent().parent() div
[02:48:06] <Hausas_> not at the beginning of it
[02:49:26] <Uhkis> could you make a fiddle of it?
[02:50:31] <Hausas_> Uhmm...
[02:53:05] <Hausas_> In jsfiddle it works
[02:53:11] <Hausas_> but not in my project
[02:53:13] <Hausas_> lol
[02:53:41] <Uhkis> check console for other js errors and double check the markup
[02:56:05] <Hausas_> hmm, there are no errors in console
[02:56:12] <Hausas_> that's what's strange
[02:57:18] <Uhkis> can you show the actual project?
[02:58:11] <Hausas_> The actual project is like millions lines of code
[02:58:43] <Uhkis> well we only need the one page
[02:58:48] <Hausas_> so maybe I'd better not to
[03:09:03] <tirengarfio> I'm loading a <form> from a server using ajax, but when I try to submit it, it is not actually submitted.. Here is the code: https://gist.github.com/Ziiweb/a1a33ecd52b97465c002 As you can guess I expect an alert('Form submited') after submit it.
[03:09:15] <opalepatrick> anything I can use with plesk 11+ to block incoming mail 'TO' addresses?

[03:58:47] <decx> delegate
[03:58:52] <decx> tirengarfio
[03:59:21] <tirengarfio> where exactly please? decx
[03:59:36] <decx> $("form").on('submit', function() {
[03:59:48] <decx> this looks for all form element that are on the page on load
[04:00:01] <decx> but as you load a new form in there it doesnt apply
[04:00:16] <decx> therefore you must delegate the event to an element that already exists on pageload
[04:00:31] <decx> so probably #movie-data
[04:00:51] <decx> now you can $('#movie-data').on('submit','form',fn
[04:06:49] <tirengarfio> decx, thanks! it is working
[04:07:22] <decx> delegate before you generate - preach it brother
[05:20:36] <ahandy> hi guys, i have a website where having a timer that is exactly the same on all computers accessing the website is a must, so it needs to have the same timer, and should not even be a fraction of a second off
[05:20:46] <ahandy> what do you guys suggest to maintain the sync between the timers
[05:22:23] <Vivekananda_y510> hi everyone
[05:40:09] <arisalexis> my bootstrap modal freezes everything. i saw some stack o. answers and they say move it to the body element which i did and it's not working. any ideas?
[06:00:32] <decx> ahandy what for like a countdown to a specific time or what?
[06:00:50] <ahandy> decx: it‚Äôs an auction side with a countdown to an expiry date for the product
[06:01:10] <decx> well just do a countdown then
[06:01:39] <arisalexis> my bootstrap modal freezes everything. i saw some stack o. answers and they say move it to the body element which i did and it's not working. any ideas?
[06:01:40] <decx> like google "js countdown to date" and the first stack will be it ^^
[06:03:12] <ahandy> decx: not accurate
[06:03:17] <ahandy> decx: tried the whole stack
[06:03:52] <decx> accurate enough
[06:04:09] <jinkel> I have two click event. One gets priority over the other. I want the other to have more priority. This is the one that gets priority: $('#menu ul li a').click
[06:04:09] <jinkel> this is the one that doesnt: $('.items').on('click',
[06:04:23] <jinkel> How do I give the one that doesn't have more priority priority?
[06:04:48] <weems|work> If I want a form‚Äôs input to be appended to a url and to redirect to that url on button click, what do I do?
[06:08:58] <ahandy> decx: not really, in my case, the millisecond matters
[06:10:15] <luvmyh0nda-[idle> is now away: [reason: Idle after 10h]±[pager: yes]±[Áß]
[06:10:47] <Uhkis> ahandy: how about making +1 minute if there's a single last minute bid? (limit the time of course)
[06:11:52] <sacho> ahandy, what do you mean "not accurate enough"?
[06:12:18] <ahandy> sacho: i mean from platform to platform there‚Äôs around .5s difference
[06:12:20] <ahandy> it‚Äôs not the same timer
[06:12:48] <sacho> well, don't rely on their own time, send a time to track from the server
[06:13:43] <ahandy> sacho: i‚Äôm doing that, but there‚Äôs still a time difference that I can‚Äôt track
[06:14:20] * sacho isn't really sure what you're talking about
[06:14:25] <jinkel> what does stopPropagation
[06:14:26] <jinkel> do
[06:14:27] <jinkel> ?
[06:14:35] <sacho> jinkel, have you asked google yet?
[06:15:01] <decx> ahandy i'd say do that <1min thing. what you are trying to do is sisyphus work at best
[06:15:52] <decx> there is performance.now() to get high res time if you are into self torture though
[06:16:12] <sacho> ahandy, as long as all your clients are ticking down the same time
[06:16:25] <sacho> then that's as accurate as you're going to get
[06:25:29] <jinkel> how do i make an element not be able to run its clicked event if it has a class of 'active'?
[06:25:57] <decx> let it run its click event but inside check for class and return if it hits
[06:26:04] <Hausas> What's that supposed to mean? Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [object HTMLDivElement] input
[06:26:16] <flam_> if($(this).hasClass('active')) return;
[06:27:27] <BinaryKitten> flam_ that would still allow natural clicks
[06:27:43] <flam_> what do you mean with natural clicks?
[06:28:00] <BinaryKitten> eg on a links.. the clicks would still trigger the default action
[06:28:35] <BinaryKitten> jinkel $(document).on('click', '.active', function(evt) { evt.preventDefault(); return false; });
[06:29:00] <jinkel> excellent thanks guys
[06:34:40] <decx> a separate event just to return false? franky i am disgusted BinaryKitten ;)
[06:34:52] <decx> ly*
[06:38:48] <BillCriswell> How dare you?
[06:39:48] <decx> *throws down the gauntlet*
[06:44:08] <jugg_> hey, i have a div that has no class, only a style attribute, is there a way to add to this div the style display:none ?
[06:45:30] <decx> you really don't want to have a selector dependent on the style attribute
[06:46:30] <weems|work> If I want a form‚Äôs input to be appended to a url and to redirect to that url on button click, what do I do?
[06:49:52] <BillCriswell> weems|work: window.location = '/some-url/' + $input.val(); for the most part.
[06:50:13] <weems|work> k
[06:58:00] <BillCriswell> "Lead Responsive Developer", ugh
[06:58:16] <drej> it just means he's heavy BillCriswell
[06:58:23] <drej> (cuz he's made of lead!)
[06:58:35] <BillCriswell> Damn English is stupid.
[06:58:44] <decx> but he's also responsive
[06:58:45] <drej> it sure is
[06:58:53] <decx> so lead with a landline
[06:59:27] <BillCriswell> I always liked Polish and polish.
[07:08:33] <MarkyC> is each() guaranteed to preserve the order the elements appear in the DOM?
[07:08:48] <sacho> yes
[07:08:58] <MarkyC> sacho: thank you
[07:09:25] <sacho> well, to be precise, each() has nothing to do with the order elements appear in the dom
[07:09:32] <sacho> since it iterates over jquery collections
[07:09:56] <sacho> but as long as you selected them in order..
[07:13:27] <MarkyC> sacho: I'm crudely checking a forms answers are correct ( https://gist.github.com/MarkyC/bb68a84c2b52d700b5b5 ). I don't care if users cheat. Is using each() here a good idea?
[07:13:53] <MarkyC> (it's a little tutorial intended to introduce the customer to our product)
[07:14:10] <sacho> that's a very vague question.
[07:14:53] <decx> if you want to gather informations from the dom to use afterwards then $.map() would be prefereable to $.each
[07:15:21] <MarkyC> decx: I'll look into that
[07:16:02] <MarkyC> sacho: Is there anything I can do to clear that up? I'm more of a Java/PHP (backend) guy than a web dev, admittedly
[07:43:32] <pnj> could someone suggest me something to work/try so that I can increase my coding skills? I'm not a beginner but not an super good either
[07:48:07] <decx> make a game
[08:08:47] <suy> pnj: grab some open source project that you happen to use. Add a feature or fix a bug (the latter is less exciting, but more valuable, and probably you'll learn more).
[08:17:43] <zagaza> hi guys, how can I do this in javascript? if a div with class "pew" is being loaded on the page, add class "mew" to another div?
[08:17:56] <zagaza> err jquery*
[08:18:02] <duch_kazatel> zagaza how is that div getting added to the page?
[08:18:24] <zagaza> by clicking on a link to load it
[08:18:34] <zagaza> or by typing in the adress
[08:18:38] <duch_kazatel> loaded via ajax?
[08:18:41] <zagaza> nah
[08:18:49] <duch_kazatel> basically, you need to add that logic to whatever adds the div.
[08:19:12] <zagaza> ah I see, thought if there is perhaps a way to make jquery recognize that a div with that class is being loaded
[08:19:26] <duch_kazatel> you can with javascript, but it's painfully slow.
[08:19:34] <zagaza> ah ok ok I'll avoid it then
[08:19:36] <decx> make a custom event and trigger that
[08:19:41] <duch_kazatel> ^^ or do that.
[08:19:47] <zagaza> that sounded hella advanced
[08:19:53] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[08:19:59] <duch_kazatel> and your'e from northern california ;)
[08:20:02] <duch_kazatel> *you're
[08:20:08] <zagaza> I'm from sweden :)
[08:20:25] <zagaza> and javascript is my weakest part :)
[08:20:29] <duch_kazatel> woah.  i haven't heard anybody outside of NorCal use the word "Hella" seriously before.
[08:20:42] <zagaza> guess I've been listening to too much westcoast rap lol
[08:20:44] <decx> i have an aunt named hella
[08:21:17] <zagaza> actually
[08:21:20] <decx> zagaza custom event is easy http://jsfiddle.net/decx/xQp9M/
[08:21:55] <zagaza> what Im trying to do here with js, should be much easier than it is, it's just tearing my brain because I used wordpress the "wrong" way
[08:22:06] <Uhkis> "hella" is finnish for "stove" :-D
[08:22:20] <BinaryKitten> zagaza at "wordpress the wrong way"
[08:23:07] <zagaza> yeah well, I added custom markup to a wordpress page, that are masonry "cards", which contain anchors to their corresponding posts
[08:23:37] <zagaza> that way, wp is not recognizing those posts as children of that menu item
[08:23:41] <BinaryKitten> zagaza if ($('.pew').length > 0) { $('other_div').addClass('mew'); }
[08:23:59] <duch_kazatel> BinaryKitten he wants to add the class when .pew gets added to the page.
[08:24:06] <zagaza> ^
[08:24:26] <BinaryKitten> ah urm don't?
[08:24:31] <BinaryKitten> lol
[08:24:37] <BinaryKitten> add the js to the html
[08:24:45] <duch_kazatel> if he emits an event when he adds the div, he can just fine.
[08:25:14] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel yeah, but easier to add the script to the html being loaded
[08:25:44] <duch_kazatel> i would argue that's a terrible ide.a
[08:26:30] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel this is wordpress
[08:26:48] <BinaryKitten> it's going to be a mess either way
[08:26:53] <duch_kazatel> sure - i use coldfusion at work.  that doesn't mean i should write bad javascript.
[08:27:05] <duch_kazatel> separations of concern and all that.
[08:27:20] <zagaza> there is probably a much better way using php but
[08:27:24] <BinaryKitten> not really possible if you're loading additional content in wordpress
[08:27:25] <zagaza> I cant get it to work
[08:27:51] <duch_kazatel> sure it's possible.  if he's using javascript to add content to the page, he can use plain ol' javascript to do the rest.
[08:27:55] <BinaryKitten> mostly if the content is being added in any way shape or form, trigger an event
[08:36:03] <stan_man_can> On our internal network our sites don‚Äôt use TLD‚Äôs, so instead of typing http://internalsite.com it‚Äôs just http://internalsite/. This seems to be breaking ajax requests though, I have a site at http://dir/subdir that‚Äôs calling ‚Äúajax.php‚Äù but when when thequest goes it says ‚ÄúPOST http://dir/subdir/ajax.php 500 (Internal Server Error)‚Äù ‚Äî I can browse to the file fine though
[08:38:53] <xMopxShell> hey, i'm having an issue where my hashchange listener isn't being called in firefox... http://pastebin.com/8YyBHbkS
[08:38:58] <xMopxShell> does anything look wrong there?
[08:41:41] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you using?
[08:41:56] <xMopxShell> duch_kazatel: 1.11.1
[08:42:08] <duch_kazatel> use .on() for all event binding instead or .bind(), then.
[08:42:19] <duch_kazatel> also, it looks like you're combining hashes and pushstates.,
[08:42:40] <duch_kazatel> also also, use .prop() instead of .attr()
[08:48:38] <xMopxShell> thanks, will do
[08:56:04] <pnj> http://jsfiddle.net/pnj4130/ADd97/
[08:56:28] <pnj> why does this entire <ul> appear to jump when just one <li> is moused over
[08:57:56] <BinaryKitten> pnj you're animating the left
[08:58:51] <pnj> BinaryKitten: I'm curious about the height part. though
[08:59:00] <BinaryKitten> it's box model
[08:59:05] <pnj> the whole line of <lii>'s drops down,..
[08:59:59] <decx> that's normal
[09:00:08] <pnj> i'm confused as to why the animation (opacity/etc) only effect the item hovered but the height effects all of the <li>'s
[09:00:15] <pnj> how would I fix that issue?
[09:00:33] <BinaryKitten> according to the Developer tools.
[09:00:38] <decx> solve it? use css for a css job
[09:00:48] <BinaryKitten> it's not affected any but the one that's being hovered
[09:01:20] <BinaryKitten> the issue is that they are displacing each other
[09:01:46] <BinaryKitten> if you add float:left to the li css they don't "jump"
[09:02:06] <BinaryKitten> ala: http://jsfiddle.net/ADd97/1/
[09:02:24] <pnj> oh, float left. very nice
[09:02:39] <pnj> thanks BinaryKitten
[09:02:45] <BinaryKitten> np.
[09:02:59] <BinaryKitten> when in doubt, inspect element and watch what's happening to the elements
[09:04:06] <decx> the displacement is still not neat enough
[09:04:14] <decx> i'd say scrap the js and use transform scale
[09:04:25] <decx> on :hover
[09:04:43] <pnj> decx: i'm trying to learn jquery though... :)
[09:05:02] <pnj> and i'm slow and dumb so... :)

[09:28:09] <duch_kazatel> still the right term :)
[09:28:19] <krambiorix> :D
[09:28:28] <BillCriswell> What would a calmlink be?
[09:28:40] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: or megalink
[09:28:45] <krambiorix> the problem isn't the animated gif, but when the browser is loading, it stops the animation....
[09:29:01] <decx> fiddle or it didnt happen
[09:29:07] <Uhkis> really weird problem
[09:29:10] <duch_kazatel> "when the browser is loading" - are you going to another page?
[09:29:23] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, eventually yes
[09:29:32] <Uhkis> oh, that explains it
[09:29:45] <duch_kazatel> that's your problem.
[09:29:52] <Uhkis> krambiorix: if it not ajax, browser stops rendering while getting the next page
[09:30:20] <krambiorix> Uhkis, any work arounds (not implementing ajax in every page)
[09:30:28] <duch_kazatel> not using the gif.
[09:32:02] <Uhkis> ^
[09:33:26] <Uhkis> krambiorix: it sounds like you're trying to override the browser itself, which is not possible
[09:39:04] <krambiorix> hmm
[09:41:28] <krambiorix> if i make the loader gif turn by javascript , would it work then?
[09:43:54] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:44:00] <duch_kazatel> because the browser stops everything basically.
[09:44:04] <decx> i'm going on a limb here and say it will work even less than the other one doesnt work
[09:44:06] <duch_kazatel> once you're going to a new page, you're done.
[09:44:11] <duch_kazatel> decx++
[09:45:38] <Uhkis> duch_kazatel: we dont have a karma bot, do we?
[09:46:07] <decx> it runs on karma and is there for not matter based
[09:46:08] <duch_kazatel> nope, but i do it anyway :)
[09:46:10] <decx> therefore*
[09:46:28] <Uhkis> had to check #drupal's bot :D
[09:46:37] <duch_kazatel> also i do it all the time because of the one we have at work.
[09:48:01] <zuiop> anyone needs some rep upvote on SO here?
[09:48:07] <duch_kazatel> lol
[09:48:10] <duch_kazatel> SO
[09:48:16] <kreeves> hey all. ive got a general js tooling question i hope you don‚Äôt mind me asking. does anyone know how to get firebug or chrome dev tools (or another tool?) to expose what javascript code is responsible for manipulating font-size of an <h4> as soon as a page loads?
[09:48:32] <decx> ima report u, my dad works for nintendo
[09:48:47] <BillCriswell> zuiop: Are you like... selling SO upvotes? haha
[09:48:52] <Uhkis> duch_kazatel: ah, so it's a habit :-)
[09:49:46] <duch_kazatel> kreeves not that i can think of.
[09:51:03] <uuzilla1> Simple qn: how to send data from php script to javascript and print it out on html page
[09:51:05] <kreeves> bummer. :[ something is setting the font-size because the ‚Äúelement.style‚Äù is being set which normally means the code is directly in mark-up (which is not the case) or some javascript is coming along and re-sizing it.
[09:51:33] <duch_kazatel> kreeves you can search for code that uses .css() or javascript that directly edits the node.
[09:51:36] <uuzilla1> for these kinda qn. which is the best channel
[09:51:48] <duch_kazatel> uuzilla1 you can't easily.
[09:51:56] <decx> either send it with your markup or get info with ajax
[09:51:58] <uuzilla1> I know but how
[09:52:38] <uuzilla1> I tried ajax but it is wrong doing
[09:52:46] <duch_kazatel> ajax will pull it for yopu.
[09:52:48] <uuzilla1> I am lost now
[09:53:02] <uuzilla1> But I want in layman terms
[09:53:04] <duch_kazatel> php needs to include that data on a page or other endpoint
[09:53:09] <uuzilla1> for my understanding
[09:53:22] <duch_kazatel> how much PHP experience do you have?
[09:53:25] <decx> you request a page, and that page has data
[09:53:29] <uuzilla1> I have done that but now stck at ajax code']
[09:53:31] <duch_kazatel> ^^ this basically
[09:53:36] <decx> or you write your data in the page you have and pull that
[09:53:49] <duch_kazatel> show us the ajax code you've got.
[09:54:15] <uuzilla1> sure thing.
[09:54:35] <uuzilla1> I will paste it here.
[09:54:36] <duch_kazatel> use fixee or jsfiddle.  avoid pastebin, blah blah blah.
[09:54:40] <duch_kazatel> do not paste in the channe;l
[09:54:55] <uuzilla1> if($_POST['page'] == '#pg1')
[09:54:55] <uuzilla1>   echo json_parse(json_encode($pg1));
[09:55:01] <duch_kazatel> you'
[09:55:52] <duch_kazatel> *you're pasting the php.  we want the javascript.
[09:56:16] <decx> you dont need us to test if your php endpoints returns the right data
[09:56:29] <decx> you know, just go there
[09:59:13] <uuzilla1> I have it asted in jsfiddle.net
[09:59:26] <uuzilla1> how will ya check it
[09:59:38] <duch_kazatel> save it and paste the link here.
[09:59:44] <uuzilla1> my id on jsfiddle is uzilla
[09:59:56] <duch_kazatel> save the fiddle and paste the URL in the channel.
[10:00:10] <uuzilla1> http://jsfiddle.net/uzilla/tKPwg/
[10:00:17] <uuzilla1> thanks dude
[10:00:22] <decx> no, just no
[10:00:24] <duch_kazatel> that is not javascript.
[10:00:43] <duch_kazatel> that's not what we asked for.
[10:01:29] <uuzilla1> I had this part in my php code
[10:01:35] <uuzilla1> So pasted it.
[10:02:04] <drej> BillCriswell i ahve yosemite on an imac, yeah, but not on my primary
[10:02:31] <BillCriswell> I did it on my primary. It's going well so far luckilyhaha
[10:03:18] <duch_kazatel> uuzilla1 that's not what we asked for.  we need your javascript.
[10:03:48] <uuzilla1> sure.. dude check it out now
[10:05:30] <drej> BillCriswell have you tried the ios8 integrations yet?
[10:06:08] <BillCriswell> I have not.
[10:06:26] <BillCriswell> You?
[10:07:10] <drej> BillCriswell yeah i played with it a bit yesterday
[10:07:26] <drej> nothing overly spectacular, seems more gimmicky than anything to me
[10:07:59] <PantsOfChoco> super gimmicky
[10:08:04] <PantsOfChoco> wait what are we talking about
[10:08:05] <BillCriswell> Yeah, all the features seem like they'll be great if they work well but if they don't completely annoying.
[10:09:11] <uuzilla1> No reply ; what should I consider for my answer
[10:10:23] <BillCriswell> Oh boy.
[10:13:21] <Uhkis> uuzilla1: you should learn the basics of php and javascript before trying to make anything fancy
[10:13:38] <duch_kazatel> uuzilla1 you have to save it and paste in a new link here for us to see it.
[10:13:50] <krambiorix> to get back to my loader question.. Would it work if i somehow cache the animated gif?
[10:13:56] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix nope.
[10:14:07] <duch_kazatel> nothing is going to change what you want
[10:14:15] <Uhkis> krambiorix: nope
[10:14:31] <uuzilla1> I know. I am a starter in terms of javascript
[10:14:38] <decx> you can preventdefault the link, put your loader and then set window location
[10:14:43] <decx> but that's just ridiculous
[10:14:49] <Uhkis> krambiorix: you either have to load the things by ajax or rely on the browsers loading animation
[10:14:50] <decx> but maybe you want to be ridiculous
[10:14:55] <decx> do you want to be ridiculous?
[10:15:04] <duch_kazatel> uuzilla1 save the fiddle and share the updated link.
[10:15:09] <uuzilla1> But in terms of PHP  I know a few years back like around 15 years'
[10:15:26] <uuzilla1> I will do it in a proper way again
[10:15:33] <uuzilla1> on jsfiddle.net
[10:15:42] <krambiorix> decx nope
[10:15:49] <uuzilla1> will post the link again
[10:15:55] <Uhkis> uuzilla1: no offense but no one with 15 years of php does things like you pasted.
[10:15:58] <krambiorix> Uhkis, can i use the browsers loading animation in the window ?
[10:16:19] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix nope.
[10:16:19] <Uhkis> krambiorix: no
[10:16:29] <uuzilla1> Well I was working on php but later I lost everything I learnt
[10:16:39] <krambiorix> hmmm
[10:16:46] <duch_kazatel> uuzilla1 i think you need to go back and learn some basics.
[10:16:53] <duch_kazatel> start with PHP or JavaScript.
[10:17:05] <uuzilla1> Yeah so I am here to learn from you guys
[10:17:12] <Uhkis> duch_kazatel: i said it already ;-)
[10:17:20] <krambiorix> when navigating to another page, does it also stop css ?
[10:17:27] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix basically it stops everything.
[10:17:31] <Uhkis> krambiorix: yes
[10:17:38] <krambiorix> pffff
[10:17:51] <Uhkis> uuzilla1: could you explain what are you trying to do
[10:18:07] <duch_kazatel> uuzilla1 we're not really a great resource for something like that.  we can answer jquery questions, but we're not really a good place to coach you like that.  you could always go to codeacademy or learn.jquery.com
[10:18:22] <krambiorix> then the only thing i can do is finding an non animated image that let's the user think that it's loading.... :D
[10:18:28] <krambiorix> anyone some ideas on that?
[10:18:44] <uuzilla1> Hi again, I am trying to get data from a database and post that data on html using javascript
[10:18:44] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix native browser behavior should be enough for that.
[10:19:00] <Uhkis> krambiorix: the only thing you can do is a) let it be b) ajax it
[10:19:10] <duch_kazatel> uuzilla1 you cannot get data from a database using javascript.  you can get it via php.  start there.
[10:19:32] <uuzilla1> I got the data from php as a array
[10:19:34] <Uhkis> uuzilla1: do you know how to get that data to an array? array being php array
[10:19:38] <kreeves> duch_kazatel: found my culprit http://fittextjs.com/  didn‚Äôt realize our designer we worked with for a bit threw that in there
[10:19:54] <duch_kazatel> uuzilla1 okay.  so you can hit a url and get that data to display?
[10:19:56] <uuzilla1> I want that array to be posted on web page using javascript
[10:20:11] <duch_kazatel> uuzilla1 with ajax?
[10:20:18] <krambiorix> how can i google this: a non animated image that gives the perspection that it's turning around but it doesn't ? :D
[10:20:28] <uuzilla1> sure
[10:20:44] <uuzilla1> I think it is the solution for my qn.
[10:21:17] <duch_kazatel> uuzilla1 okay, $.ajax('put/your/url/here.php').done(function(data){$('body').append(data)});
[10:21:21] <duch_kazatel> it will look something like that.
[10:21:34] <Uhkis> uuzilla1: you need to: print json_encode($your_array); to get the array to javascript
[10:23:29] <Uhkis> uuzilla1: like "$var = array(1,2,3,4); print '<script> javascripthere( ' . json_encode($var) . ')';"
[10:23:37] <uuzilla1> http://jsfiddle.net/uzilla/tKPwg/3/
[10:23:59] <uuzilla1> Now check out the link I have put what ever I had
[10:24:12] <uuzilla1> so you will understand what I want
[10:24:21] <duch_kazatel> wat
[10:24:21] <uuzilla1> that is my belief
[10:24:29] <Uhkis> uuzilla1: you put the php on css frame intentionally?
[10:24:44] <duch_kazatel> and links for the ico and stuff in the javascript panel?
[10:25:25] <uuzilla1> I did not find any place to fit in jsfiddle
[10:25:35] <uuzilla1> so intensionally did that
[10:25:35] <duch_kazatel> it's not relevant to your question.
[10:26:15] <uuzilla1> like what ?
[10:26:23] <duch_kazatel> what you want will end up looking something like this: http://fixee.org/paste/vvfxx4c/
[10:26:46] <duch_kazatel> instead of the ajax load stuff you've got now.
[10:27:01] <uuzilla1> I got kinda
[10:28:43] <Uhkis> uuzilla1: and this is what you want from the php side http://fixee.org/paste/qozs5g4/
[10:29:55] <Uhkis> (mainly the line 5)
[10:31:18] <uuzilla1> sure but the thing what I require is in a varible array
[10:31:26] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:31:47] <Uhkis> uuzilla1: just like in my example.
[10:31:48] <uuzilla1> I want that variable to be put in json
[10:32:08] <Uhkis> uuzilla1: check the line 5 of my example
[10:32:31] <uuzilla1> I am checking your examoke now sirry
[10:32:38] <uuzilla1> sorry
[10:33:12] <PantsOfChoco> ugh this day is going extremely slow
[10:33:35] <Uhkis> PantsOfChoco: it did, back when at work :D
[10:33:39] <duch_kazatel> mine is going slooooowwwww
[10:33:47] <PantsOfChoco> its only 1030!
[10:33:49] <PantsOfChoco> OH GOD
[10:35:35] <Uhkis> PantsOfChoco: no.. it's 20:35 :)
[10:35:41] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[10:36:26] <uuzilla1> What is in data now
[10:36:46] <duch_kazatel> uuzilla1 :( did you even try the code?
[10:36:55] <uuzilla1> and where should I incroprate the code you have given me
[10:37:12] <uuzilla1> nope
[10:38:06] <duch_kazatel> you need to go back and learn some basics, yo.
[10:39:30] <decx> still with this? good thing i noped outta there 30 minutes ago
[10:39:40] <duch_kazatel> yeah i'm about to give up.
[10:42:06] <Uhkis> decx: don't read up.
[10:45:09] <decx> i just did
[10:45:23] <decx> lululu i got some apples, lululu you got some too....
[10:50:36] <Uhkis> is there any way to boost canvas rendering on firefox?
[10:50:59] <decx> depends on what you're doing
[10:51:10] <Uhkis> http://uhkis.net/b2/
[10:51:14] <decx> caching stuff you redraw every frame in a shadow canvas helps
[10:51:24] <Uhkis> made that out of boredom yesterday
[10:51:45] <decx> seems ok to me
[10:51:45] <Uhkis> really laggy on firefox
[10:51:49] <decx> ff
[10:52:24] <duch_kazatel> the click is laggy yeah
[10:52:28] <decx> you need to make that hitzone bigger
[10:52:52] <Uhkis> haha
[10:53:10] <Uhkis> decx: that was the first feedback i ever got when i did that on android years ago :D
[10:53:35] <decx> it's also better to make an inverse collision check
[10:53:44] <decx> so you check if it's not touching
[10:54:15] <Uhkis> decx: did it out of boredom, it doesn't have any checks
[10:54:32] <decx> in the bounce function
[10:54:42] <decx> that's your collision check
[10:54:46] <Uhkis> yup
[10:54:53] <decx> you check if the cursor is inside
[10:55:00] <decx> but it's faster to check if it's not
[10:55:03] <Uhkis> it just inverts the currents movement
[10:55:19] <Uhkis> huh?
[10:56:13] <decx> an inverse check for 2 rectangles touching would be like: (a.y + a.s) < b.y || a.y > (b.y + b.h) || (a.x + a.s) < b.x || a.x > (b.x + b.w)
[10:56:40] <Uhkis> decx: that's faster? O_o
[10:56:42] <duch_kazatel> dammit there goes decx again with his math
[10:56:45] <decx> a bit
[10:56:58] <decx> probably because OR is faster than AND
[10:56:59] <Jattenalle> decx, a.s?
[10:57:00] <Uhkis> decx: weird
[10:57:08] <duch_kazatel> kind of like reverse array iteration: you wouldn't think it's faster, but it iz.
[10:57:10] <duch_kazatel> *is
[10:57:33] <decx> Jattenalle oh right s is size because a is a square in that snippet
[10:57:40] <Jattenalle> decx, ah
[10:57:44] <decx> from here http://jsfiddle.net/decx/rbpsv/16/
[10:58:19] <jinkel> Can someone tell me why this plugin I'm using called perfect scroll bar is not getting set to this class I specifiy to it but rather my page? http://jsfiddle.net/2FPyf/
[10:58:52] <Uhkis> decx: i think it's just ff (or one of my extensions)
[10:59:02] <Uhkis> decx: that was really really far from 60fps also
[10:59:25] <decx> some more collision detection http://jsfiddle.net/decx/9R3YP/
[11:00:32] <Uhkis> one would think simple animation like mine would have smooth fps
[11:00:39] <decx> it should
[11:00:54] <Uhkis> and it has on chrome
[11:03:16] <duch_kazatel> the animation is smooth on my machine.
[11:03:34] <Uhkis> must be an addon then
[11:04:01] <Uhkis> because it was semi-smooth (~45fps) on my work computer which is horrible
[11:06:33] <drej> Uhkis jankfree.org
[11:06:51] <drej> to understand how to optimize rendering performance in browsers
[11:07:51] <decx> maybe set you coordinates to full pixels or else you get subpixel antialiasing which can get quite expensive
[11:07:54] <Uhkis> drej: doesn't really help if the tools are for chrome
[11:08:09] * drej blinks
[11:08:16] <drej> the principles are the same.
[11:08:33] <drej> also why arent you using chrome devtools if youre a developer?
[11:08:39] <Uhkis> drej: but that 20min "game" already has 60fps on chrome
[11:11:32] <Uhkis> this is the original one from 4 years ago: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fi.tamk.bouncy
[11:24:39] <guzzlefry> Any way to have all links open in new tabs, even ones created dynamically?
[11:25:44] <duch_kazatel> target="_blank"
[11:25:54] <duch_kazatel> you can't guarantee if it's a new window or a new tab.
[11:28:23] <guzzlefry> duch_kazatel: right, but is there a way to have that apply to newly created links?
[11:28:44] <duch_kazatel> .prop('target', '_blank')
[11:29:21] <guzzlefry> I'm calling that in $(document).ready() already, but some links are loaded via ajax such as the dropdown menus.
[11:29:31] <guzzlefry> This might not be possible.
[11:32:20] <guzzlefry> oh I see what's going on. The links aren't actually loaded dynamically, but the menu links' click events are handled to load the content via ajax...
[11:36:11] <decx> Uhkis http://jsfiddle.net/decx/27Lez/ now the velocityX on the bounce depends on where you hit the ball ^^
[11:36:12] <duch_kazatel> welp.
[11:37:24] <Uhkis> decx: as i said many times, wrote that in an hour :P
[11:37:53] <decx> if i see canvas i have to play around you dont have to explain yourself
[11:37:55] <decx> ^^
[11:41:24] <duch_kazatel> decx is awesome like that
[11:42:00] <BillCriswell> I'm trying to math right now and I keep putting myself in loops.
[11:44:52] <decx> well as long as you dont put yourself in a m√∂bius strip all is ok
[11:44:57] <BillCriswell> Oh it's because I'm an idiot.
[11:45:10] <BillCriswell> decx: That joke was too intelligent for me.
[11:45:13] <BillCriswell> Assuming it was a joke.
[11:45:54] <decx> well you don't want to be an ouroboros
[11:46:02] <decx> that would make you a total zero
[11:46:12] <BillCriswell> I'm about to /part.
[11:46:29] <decx> wait wait... more loop puns are somewhere
[11:46:35] <decx> hidden
[11:46:38] <decx> 8 !
[11:47:06] <BillCriswell> The image for the ouroboros on wikipedia looks like a fox to me.
[11:47:54] <decx> a firefox eh
[11:47:56] <decx> huehuehue
[11:48:38] <duch_kazatel> lel
[12:53:03] <switches> Anyone think they can get this working without using position:absolute? http://jsfiddle.net/crocodile/TAkhM
[12:57:20] <systemfault> switches: That's a JS question‚Ä¶ but have you tried setting position: relative instead of absolute?
[12:58:37] <BillCriswell> So many people messing with scroll bars today.
[12:59:24] <switches> nice i think that was it thanks systemfault
[12:59:46] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: the price of mobile
[12:59:50] <switches> btw how was that a JS question?
[12:59:56] <switches> Isn't it written in jquery?
[13:01:14] <systemfault> switches: For a second I thought I was on #CSS
[13:01:19] <systemfault> switches: Sorry :)
[13:01:20] <drej> why in gods name are people stil trying to force scrolling interactions on people
[13:01:22] <drej> its 2014 ffs
[13:02:09] <drej> scrolling behaviour should always be left up to the device / browser
[13:02:20] <Uhkis> decx: not everyone can afford rehab ;D
[13:02:51] <switches> drej:  is that in reference to my question?
[13:02:56] <drej> yes
[13:03:18] <switches> meh
[13:03:29] <switches> i was gonna talk more but i got indifferent lol
[13:03:54] <drej> i can respect that
[13:03:59] <Uhkis> and mine was for drej, sorry decx
[13:04:33] <duch_kazatel> weeeee
[13:04:36] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: I doubt he was busy anyway.
[13:05:11] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: you're saying decx has no life apart from jquery?
[13:05:24] <BillCriswell> No, just that i doubt he was actually doing work.
[13:05:51] <BillCriswell> Well, work that he's getting paid for haha
[13:06:27] <Uhkis> well that's not atypical for this channel
[13:06:33] <BillCriswell> Truth.
[13:06:55] <drej> not atypical ?
[13:06:58] <drej> you mean, typical.
[13:07:23] <Uhkis> drej: nah, i meant not atypical because double negative is awesome
[13:07:46] <Uhkis> don't you agree BillCriswell
[13:08:07] <BillCriswell> I definite don't not agree.
[13:08:15] <drej> lol
[13:08:35] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: so you definitely don't disagree?
[13:08:41] <BillCriswell> ... both.
[13:09:40] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: are you absolutely not sure you disagree?
[13:09:50] <drej> i agree that both of you should shut the fuck up about it
[13:09:52] <drej> or dont
[13:09:53] <drej> not
[13:10:18] <drej> :)
[13:10:52] <BillCriswell> I like that plan.
[13:10:59] <BillCriswell> Fuck, 50 minutes left.
[13:11:36] <drej> i left work early
[13:11:39] <drej> at 3, i said "fuck it" and left
[13:11:44] <duch_kazatel> anybody here have a particular favorite js linting plugin for sublime text?
[13:11:53] <drej> duch_kazatel: grunt :)
[13:11:57] <drej> not sublime specific
[13:12:39] <Uhkis> vim ftw
[13:13:06] <BillCriswell> I've opened vim a few times accidentally. It was pretty scary.
[13:13:26] <Uhkis> how so?
[13:14:08] <drej> it called him names
[13:14:11] <drej> and threw things at him
[13:14:41] <tandroid> what's the difference between $(window).width() and window.screen.width?
[13:14:52] <BillCriswell> I just have no idea what I'm doing with it Uhkis.
[13:14:53] <duch_kazatel> vim is great.  only 15 keypresses and you can type a letter!
[13:15:12] <Uhkis> duch_kazatel: shush! :D
[13:15:23] <BillCriswell> Watching someone who really knows vim use it is pretty impressive though.
[13:15:44] <duch_kazatel> better than emacs where you have to use both hands and a foot to press a bunch of simultaneous keys.
[13:16:15] <Uhkis> duch_kazatel: and get carpal tunnel syndrome while at it
[13:16:51] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: basics arent that difficult, just press insert and you're on your way
[13:17:12] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: I dig my GUI.
[13:17:29] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[13:17:36] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: yeah, until you learn vim ;)
[13:17:49] <Nyoom> Anyone got a script that reloads all javascript of a page? (element.load(¬®file.php .className¬®) just loads content not the javascript files :/
[13:18:00] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: I haven't felt the need for a better editor.
[13:18:18] <BillCriswell> I just wrote something in Javascript... not realizing I should be doing it in Sass.
[13:18:22] <BillCriswell> s/not/now
[13:18:26] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: ..because you haven't vim ;)
[13:18:29] <duch_kazatel> Nyoom that's a... strange thing to want to do.
[13:18:51] <Nyoom> Yeah.
[13:18:59] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: If someone was to demonstrate something really useful it could do that I can't do I might consider investing the time, but it's not worth it as of now.
[13:19:12] <duch_kazatel> Nyoom why do you want to do that?
[13:19:16] <BillCriswell> Switching editors is a HUGE deal.
[13:19:22] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: :s/not/now/g ;-)
[13:19:38] <Nyoom> I'm reloading a class that contains a newsFeed. a js script fixes the current timestamp to 'blabla minutes ago' "$(".newsFeed").fadeOut('fast').load("index.php?recent-activity/ .newsFeed").fadeIn('fast');"
[13:19:43] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: yeah, it is, tried 3 guis, all horrible
[13:19:47] <BillCriswell> Only wanted to replace it one! Assuming that's a global modifier.
[13:19:49] <Nyoom> And with that line it doesn't do that.
[13:20:00] <duch_kazatel> Nyoom you need to setup a function that you can call that does that for you.
[13:20:01] <BillCriswell> replace it once*
[13:20:31] <BillCriswell> I love sassmeister.
[13:22:39] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: :% is for that
[13:23:00] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: I have no idea what's going on haha
[13:23:14] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: learn vim ;)
[13:23:24] <BillCriswell> Nevar.
[13:23:30] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: nao!
[13:24:02] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: i really love the :e http://path/to/file
[13:24:17] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/zefoziso/1/edit What would you call this pattern in the output?
[13:24:26] <BillCriswell> Does that just go to a file?
[13:25:06] <BillCriswell> I think "blocks" is a good enough name haha
[13:25:34] <Nyoom> duch_kazatel, would do if i knew what function does it
[13:25:48] <Uhkis> BillCriswell: mess? ;D
[13:25:58] <BillCriswell> Uhkis: It's a pretty extreme example.
[13:26:07] <BillCriswell> Er, maybe not.
[13:26:34] <decx> Mega Bloks
[13:26:44] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[13:26:56] <decx> sweet implementation
[13:26:58] <BillCriswell> Originally wrote it as js, thinking sass mixin now.
[13:27:04] <decx> mind if i snag that
[13:27:10] <BillCriswell> using nth-child
[13:27:12] <BillCriswell> decx: Nope.
[13:27:16] <decx> thx
[13:27:26] <BillCriswell> I feel like that simple math can be done a lot better.
[13:28:40] <BillCriswell> decx: I'm thinking a few different "patterns" to give it a random feeling.
[13:31:26] <BillCriswell> Oh crap it's vertically responsive.
[13:31:29] <BillCriswell> Niceee
[13:32:07] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/puremowu/1/edit?css,js,output weee
[13:44:50] <kolix> hey guys
[13:45:41] <kolix> if i have an html form element like this - <input type='text' name='keywords[]'> - how do i add to this object and .serialize() it so i can send it to server via post
[13:47:17] <BillCriswell> kolix: You would just serialize the sort it's in.
[13:47:45] <BillCriswell> $('form').serialize() would give you something like ?keywords[]=value assuming that's the only inpu tin there.
[13:48:32] <kolix> so '&keywords[]=value' is an acceptable php data string?
[13:49:34] <BillCriswell> kolix: It would be encoded I believe but yeah. Then $_GET['keywords'] in your PHP would be an array with one item.
[13:50:29] <BillCriswell> ?keywords[]=foo&keywords[]=bar&name=bill Would give you 2 elements in $keywords and a string for $name.
[13:50:43] <BillCriswell> Well, $_GET['name'] and $_GET['keywords']
[13:53:21] <kolix> ahh ok
[14:07:38] <vanags> viuviu
[14:08:01] <vanags> mi sa koding in da jiquery
[14:08:20] <vanags> in da club mi drinking und koding
[14:13:16] <shodan45> is there a way to use .data() with a function, similar to .attr()'s http://api.jquery.com/attr/#attr-attributeName-function ?
[14:15:38] <shodan45> I have several (old!) forms with many hundreds of fields each, and they all have onchange="..."
[14:22:08] <shodan45> my code: http://jsbin.com/dififuyi/1/edit?js
[14:23:00] <shodan45> I think it's working, but it seems weird to "rename" the html attribute like that
[14:26:33] <shodan45> I originally planned to save the existing onchange value via the element's data(), but it doesn't have a "call a function with 'this' set to the current element" variant
[14:27:41] <shodan45> or am I missing something?
[14:29:06] <AcidRain> wtf does NaN mean?
[14:29:18] <AcidRain> NO where in any of my code is the word NaN
[14:34:16] <thebope> Not a Number
[14:34:18] <Uhkis> AcidRain: not a number
[14:34:29] <AcidRain> thx
[14:39:41] <shodan45> actually, scratch that, it doesn't work
[14:41:19] <shodan45> anyone have ideas on dealing with onchange & .change(), without changing the html?
[14:43:31] <AcidRain> thank god for backups
[14:43:43] <AcidRain> i chopped that file beyond fixability
[14:50:45] <tw2113> version control helps there too AcidRain
[15:13:24] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsbin.com/xekufefi/1/edit?css,output weee
[15:43:08] <decx> BillCriswell wow nice port
[15:48:33] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, makes more sense in the CSS to me.
[16:11:34] <Bauer> if I am inside a $(form).submit function, and I have this object (the form) - how do I serialize it's data, without doing $("form").serialize()?
[16:11:53] <Bauer> in other words how do I use this, without selecting the element again?
[16:15:49] <duch_kazatel> cache the form.
[16:15:52] <duch_kazatel> $(this).serialize()
[16:15:56] <duch_kazatel> pick one.
[16:19:36] <jumanji> hi guys how can i turn N number of arrays into a single multidimensional array? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24965829/javascript-combine-array-of-arrays-into-an-array-of-single-multidimensional-arr
[16:22:56] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:23:20] <Bauer> thanks duch_kazatel
[16:23:31] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[16:26:59] <rubberduck> i have a quick question
[18:08:09] <uuzilla> HEllo, direct qn. I want to pull data from mysql using php and put that data on html using javascript .
[18:08:24] <uuzilla> I have done the basic of mysql and php
[18:08:43] <uuzilla> I have data in php array but I want to put the data using javascript
[18:08:46] <uuzilla> lost here
[18:10:01] <BillCriswell> uuzilla: in the php do echo json_encode($array); the do like $.get('file.php').done(function(phparray){ /* Loop through phparray, which will be the array from the php file */ });
[18:10:38] <uuzilla> thanks dude.
[18:11:37] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[18:32:29] <destre> hmm, no.
[18:37:48] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[18:41:48] <destre> Ok.
[18:43:42] <destre> ayecee: 241 is the decimal
[18:44:07] <BillCriswell> destre: Think you're typing in the wrong channel bud.
[18:44:45] <destre> Ok.
[18:45:20] <destre> guess my info was off.
[18:46:16] <destre> that should be the ascii value
[18:55:25] <paul_uk> hi all.  can anyone recommend a better for tokenized input?  this is buggy: https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2
[18:58:13] <paul_uk> oh i found selectize
[18:58:40] <Horacsio> Hi I‚Äôm using fullpage.js https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#callbacks and I need to callback an animation that‚Äôs preformed by a .js external file.
[18:59:47] <frank_o> paul_uk: yeah selectize rocks
[19:00:21] <Horacsio> I‚Äôm using the callback option like this: http://pastebin.com/PVgGiYUv
[19:00:36] <Horacsio> but I think I‚Äôm calling the js file wrongly
[19:00:45] <paul_uk> frank_o: it would be nice if these controls could populate themselves.  like im editing a page and i want to prepop the control.
[19:02:19] <paul_uk> oh i see there a token = a div, oh better than select2 then.  cool
[19:04:38] <Horacsio> hello?
[19:13:36] <frank_o> paul_uk: yup
[19:14:09] <paul_uk> frank_o: it looks much better than select2.  im rigging select2 right now and its not always working.  i‚Äôll definitely give this a shot.  thanks!
[19:16:16] <frank_o> Hey, can anyone tell why - when emulating a mobile device in Chrome - iScroll 5 stops scrolling after jquery-embedly has transformed my SoundCloud URLs into image links?
[19:16:19] <frank_o> It works fine if I disable touch gestures, or when I disable mobile emulation altogether. Could there be something in jquery-embedly (https://github.com/embedly/embedly-jquery) which overrides iScroll's touch events? I know that iframes are known to do that, but not plain image links.
[19:20:25] <frank_o> http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/w3pvW/ sorry
[19:25:38] <BillCriswell> decx: Can't write this blocks thing in a way that feels clean to use.
[19:31:06] <Regal> yep
[23:45:16] <se_busca_ayuda> i‚Äôm looking for a .js file called jquery.backgroundPosition.js. is it deprecated? where can i find it?
[23:49:56] <yash> I have 2 divs. one div has simple text and other div has a vertical menu in it
[23:50:27] <yash> I show the 2nd div (one having vertical menu) on 1st div hover
[23:50:58] <yash> and when I move my mouse out from div 2 (one having menu) I hide div2
[23:51:12] <yash> but for some reason when I go to my menu items it gets closed
[23:53:13] <Jattenalle> well, that was today's stupid bug out of the way i hope.. was using (this) when i should be using (element), couldnt for the life of me figure out why it didnt work... <3
