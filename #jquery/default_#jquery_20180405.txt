[00:01:49] <taplar> FlyingPersian have you tried console logging the data in the ajax callback?
[00:02:13] <taplar> ah they left
[05:26:41] <Duikb00t> hi,
[05:52:39] <Duikb00t> Why, is the name field not applying to my cloned fields? (It's generated correctly but not applied ( line 29,30,31 )
[05:52:41] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/jzadrz7g/
[05:54:19] <Woet> Duikb00t: please turn it into a minimal test case
[05:54:31] <Woet> Duikb00t: and probably because your selectors are wrong.
[05:55:37] <Cork> Duikb00t: you modify clone but insert $clone
[05:56:17] <Cork> so i suspect it is a variable name mixup
[05:56:59] <Cork> though they are created from different sources so not sure what is the correct there
[05:57:24] <Duikb00t> Ok double-checking.
[05:57:35] <Duikb00t> The console.log's are at least corrcet.
[05:57:47] <Cork> ya, but those are just the strings
[05:57:48] <Duikb00t> And should be applied to the classnames of the cloned fieldset.
[05:58:26] <Cork> not the elements and currently you create clone with .clone() and then modify the values, followed by gc:ing the elements
[05:58:55] <Cork> and appending and unmodified $clone
[05:59:57] <Duikb00t> aha FIXED
[06:00:05] <Duikb00t> indeed it was the bad naming in the append...
[06:00:09] <Duikb00t> My bad!
[06:00:39] <Cork> and paritlay by the sub optimal choice of having variables called <something and $<something>
[06:03:48] <Duikb00t> Yeah, I am removing 1 of them.
[06:04:33] <Duikb00t> Only... I have something wrong the indexing and the starting clone, let's update this tingy.
[06:06:08] <Duikb00t> Thereis somewhere somethign wrong with the location the clone gets applid to: https://jsfiddle.net/jzadrz7g/4/
[06:06:11] <Cork> Duikb00t: i would just do $('.fieldset__service').length instead of having the count
[06:06:13] <Duikb00t> The naming ( string ) is correct.
[06:06:16] <Cork> anyway gtg
[06:06:19] <Duikb00t> ok
[06:06:24] <Duikb00t> thanks
[06:56:26] <codecutter> how do i turn the time portion (24 hours format) to a 12 hour format https://pastebin.com/naswpqd4
[06:57:27] <codecutter> instead of 18:7:10, it will be 6:07:10
[06:57:36] <codecutter> instead of 18:7:10, it will be 6:7:10
[06:58:40] <Woet> codecutter: what have you tried so far?
[06:59:13] <codecutter> well, i'm not sure how to approach this to be honest
[06:59:58] <Woet> codecutter: its rather straight forward math
[07:00:53] <Cork> codecutter: uh... hour % 12 ?
[07:01:37] <Woet> Cork: that wont work for 12 itself, but yes
[07:02:57] <Cork> i extreamly rarely use 12 hour format so not fully sure what 12 is suppose to be 12?
[07:03:30] <Cork> if yes then it would just be hour % 12 || 12
[07:03:41] <codecutter> i also need AM/PM
[07:03:54] <Cork> and that would be a simple if case...
[07:04:39] <Woet> codecutter: i see lots of results for "javascript convert 24 hour time to 12 hour"
[07:16:16] <codecutter> How do i turn APR into Apr?
[07:16:28] <codecutter> all lowercase except first
[07:16:48] <codecutter> actual string is APR
[07:17:14] <Cork> codecutter: two options, with js or through css
[07:17:28] <codecutter> js
[07:18:13] <Cork> well, then you have basically said how
[07:18:14] <Woet> codecutter: i see lots of results for "javascript all lowercase except first"
[07:18:20] <codecutter> lol
[07:18:40] <Cork> make it lowcase and then upcase the first character
[07:19:28] <Cork> if you need to do this more then rarely you could have a look at inflection
[07:24:22] <codecutter> var month = (("APRIL".substring(0,3)).toLowerCase()).charAt(0).toUpperCase();
[07:24:29] <codecutter> i'm getting 'A'
[07:24:41] <codecutter> need  'Apr'
[07:25:20] <codecutter> Woet: google that!
[07:25:45] <Woet> codecutter: what am I googling? lots of working snippets for my query.
[08:15:27] <preference> hello, how do i use jquery to make the font size equal to the height of a <div>?
[08:15:43] <preference> so that the text never flows outside of the <div>?
[08:16:19] <Cork> you can't really use jquery for that
[08:16:37] <Cork> you can use it to find the element, but all the font calculations would have to be done by a plugin or own code
[08:16:50] <preference> damn
[08:17:06] <preference> thanks
[08:18:33] <Cork> preference: and font size calculation is something the web platform support very badly currently
[09:07:01] <MikeD_> usually the div shrink-wraps the content
[11:32:09] <FlyingPersian> hello. I am working on a website with a dropdown menu (thanks to ppl in ##php) that is populated based on a SQL DB. I am using getCity.php to choose certain cities based on the first choice (state). I'm intending to transfer back the data using json, but I'm failing at populating the city dropdown list
[11:32:15] <FlyingPersian> index.php: https://gist.github.com/FlyingPersian/6c936c377cc749286e6baaaeafd606fb
[11:32:20] <FlyingPersian> getCity.php: https://gist.github.com/FlyingPersian/0dd62aa16f65798033da5b2d8494c3dd
[11:32:25] <FlyingPersian> any ideas why?
[11:39:36] <FilipNortic> FlyingPersian: somethimes the $ symbol gets taken by php and you have to write jQuery instead
[11:42:31] <FlyingPersian> okay.
[11:42:35] <FlyingPersian> so I have a slight issue right now:
[11:42:42] <FlyingPersian> t does populate the second drop down, but there are two errors: first, it doesn't append the actual entry of the DB, but populates it with "object Object". second, it continuosly appends, meaning when I select state x, it appends "object Object", when I select it different state, it appends "object Object, object Object, etc."
[12:02:05] <FlyingPersian> FilipNortic: may I ask which $ you are referring to?
[12:39:52] <LooenyToones> howdy doo deee
[12:40:53] <LooenyToones> anyone here know about objects, gots some questions :)
[13:10:24] <pavonia> Why can't they just ask their questions *sigh*
[13:10:47] <FlyingPersian> I did, feel free to answer :P
[13:11:19] <pavonia> I joined to late to see your question
[13:12:09] <robertmaxrees> so confused right how hahahhaa
[13:16:53] <FlyingPersian> <FlyingPersian> hello. I am working on a website with a dropdown menu (thanks to ppl in ##php) that is populated based on a SQL DB. I am using getCity.php to choose certain cities based on the first choice (state). I'm intending to transfer back the data using json, but I'm failing at populating the city dropdown list
[13:16:53] <FlyingPersian> <FlyingPersian> index.php: https://gist.github.com/FlyingPersian/6c936c377cc749286e6baaaeafd606fb
[13:16:53] <FlyingPersian> <FlyingPersian> getCity.php: https://gist.github.com/FlyingPersian/0dd62aa16f65798033da5b2d8494c3dd
[13:16:53] <FlyingPersian> <FlyingPersian> any ideas why?
[13:17:01] <FlyingPersian> <FlyingPersian> t does populate the second drop down, but there are two errors: first, it doesn't append the actual entry of the DB, but populates it with "object Object". second, it continuosly appends, meaning when I select state x, it appends "object Object", when I select it different state, it appends "object Object, object Object, etc."
[13:19:30] <robertmaxrees> https://gist.github.com/FlyingPersian/0dd62aa16f65798033da5b2d8494c3dd if you want to return JSON, return valid JSON - don't wrap it in html tags.
[13:19:45] <robertmaxrees> also: $('city-list').append($('<option>').text(value).attr('value', value)); this won't work.
[13:20:01] <robertmaxrees> $('city-list') isn't selecting anything.  and value isn't defined anywhere.
[13:23:16] <robertmaxrees> FlyingPersian ^
[13:33:24] <AliG1000> I am having trouble traversing, can anyone help?:  https://jsfiddle.net/dgju7fzr/
[13:33:54] <FlyingPersian> oh yeah I forgot to remove the tags in the gist
[13:34:54] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 what are you trying to select?
[13:35:21] <FlyingPersian> I have no idea why the gists are wrong. this is what I have: <FlyingPersian> t does populate the second drop down, but there are two errors: first, it doesn't append the actual entry of the DB, but populates it with "object Object". second, it continuosly appends, meaning when I select state x, it appends "object Object", when I select it different state, it appends "object Object, object Object, etc."
[13:35:22] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 there's no .dummy_trip_planner_form
[13:35:24] <FlyingPersian> damn
[13:35:28] <FlyingPersian> $('#city-list').append($('<option>').text(value).attr('value', value));
[13:35:29] <FlyingPersian> this
[13:35:31] <FlyingPersian> my bad
[13:35:53] <FlyingPersian> how do I have to define value robertmaxrees ?
[13:36:01] <FlyingPersian> I tried val value = "" ;
[13:36:51] <AliG1000> oops - I edited names slightly. What I am trying to do is 1) click on the link 2) have that link text get entered into the input field
[13:37:37] <AliG1000> edited https://jsfiddle.net/dgju7fzr/2/
[13:37:42] <robertmaxrees> FlyingPersian what do you want the value to be?
[13:38:11] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 erm...
[13:38:31] <AliG1000> I am having difficulty traversing back up
[13:38:44] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 can I make one small html change that'll make this ridiculously easy?
[13:38:45] <FlyingPersian> robertmaxrees: my intention was for value to be city_name, with the id city_id
[13:39:01] <AliG1000> @robertmaxrees sure
[13:39:08] <FlyingPersian> so that in the end it displays city_name in the dropdown (actual city names then)
[13:39:22] <robertmaxrees> FlyingPersian so in your code, value is an undefined object.
[13:39:29] <robertmaxrees> so you need to define that before you can use it.
[13:39:55] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dgju7fzr/6/
[13:40:26] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 so now, you can just go up to trip_planner_form_container and then select your input.
[13:40:57] <FlyingPersian> how exactly do I define it then?
[13:40:58] <FlyingPersian> 0
[13:40:58] <FlyingPersian> :
[13:40:58] <FlyingPersian> {city_id: "3", city_name: "Osnabrück", state_id: "9"}
[13:40:58] <FlyingPersian> 1
[13:40:58] <FlyingPersian> :
[13:40:59] <FlyingPersian> {city_id: "5", city_name: "Hannover", state_id: "9"}
[13:41:06] <FlyingPersian> this is the output I get
[13:41:14] <FlyingPersian> sorry for spamming, I thought it's better formated
[13:41:22] <robertmaxrees> it's not heh
[13:41:33] <FlyingPersian> how I understand it index refers to 0 and 1, and value to the rest
[13:41:43] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle with that data and your code?
[13:41:48] <robertmaxrees> and the generated html?
[13:41:51] <robertmaxrees> so I can step you through it.
[13:42:06] <FlyingPersian> not sure how. I'm farely new to this
[13:42:21] <robertmaxrees> would you mind trying?
[13:42:25] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:42:35] <FlyingPersian> I don't mind trying
[13:42:35] <AliG1000> @robertmaxrees, I can't see where you have changed it. Plus, there will be more than one set of tabs and links on the final page, which is why I have used classes and gone back up the tree
[13:42:36] <robertmaxrees> doesn't necessarily need to function quiite yet.
[13:42:39] <FlyingPersian> I just don'<t know what you mean :D
[13:42:52] <robertmaxrees> FlyingPersian https://jsfiddle.net/
[13:42:55] <FlyingPersian> oh
[13:42:56] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 so back WAY up
[13:43:15] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 you're using IDs in your code - if you're going to repeat this block, you can't do that.
[13:43:23] <AliG1000> yup
[13:43:35] <robertmaxrees> second - I added a div around all your markup that holds the input and related aread.
[13:44:41] <AliG1000> OK, let me re-think it...
[13:44:51] <AliG1000> thank you, btw
[13:44:56] <robertmaxrees> re-think what?
[13:45:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dgju7fzr/7/ (shrug) AliG1000
[13:45:37] <FlyingPersian> robertmaxrees: how would that work though? it doesn't have access to the db
[13:45:57] <robertmaxrees> FlyingPersian that's fine if it's nonfunctional/.
[13:46:07] <robertmaxrees> i need to see what the rendered html looks like with the code.
[13:46:12] <robertmaxrees> even if the ajax call doesn't function.
[13:46:17] <robertmaxrees> gives us a place to start.
[13:46:18] <FlyingPersian> how do I put the other file in then?
[13:46:20] <FlyingPersian> getCity.php
[13:46:34] <FlyingPersian> https://jsfiddle.net/c13vxtcw/1/
[13:46:54] <robertmaxrees> FlyingPersian you don't - we don't need it quite yet.
[13:47:00] <FlyingPersian> okay
[13:47:03] <robertmaxrees> and i need the html that's rendered, not the php on the page.
[13:47:26] <robertmaxrees> specifically, I'
[13:47:33] <robertmaxrees> *I'm looking at the dropdown.
[13:47:46] <FlyingPersian> not sure what html you mean
[13:47:58] <robertmaxrees> the stuff from <?php foreach ($result as $rs) : ?>
[13:48:07] <robertmaxrees> your php is generating html.
[13:48:11] <robertmaxrees> i need that html, not the php
[13:48:13] <FlyingPersian> oh
[13:48:15] <FlyingPersian> okay
[13:48:23] <FlyingPersian> and how do I get the html? from the source code of the page?
[13:48:35] <robertmaxrees> or your dev tools inspector :)
[13:48:53] <robertmaxrees> a sample of the JSON would be helpful, too.
[13:49:36] <FlyingPersian> https://jsfiddle.net/c13vxtcw/1/
[13:49:38] <FlyingPersian> like this?
[13:49:58] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't look any different to me >.>
[13:50:11] <robertmaxrees> did you click "update" and grab the new link?
[13:50:23] <FlyingPersian> I did
[13:50:29] <FlyingPersian> wait a sec
[13:50:33] <robertmaxrees> ah - https://jsfiddle.net/c13vxtcw/3/
[13:50:41] <FlyingPersian> try again
[13:50:47] <FlyingPersian> [{"city_id":"3","city_name":"Osnabr\u00fcck","state_id":"9"},{"city_id":"5","city_name":"Hannover","state_id":"9"}]
[13:50:49] <robertmaxrees> heh, needed the new URL>
[13:51:20] <FlyingPersian> this is the output I get when I click http://localhost/test/review/getCity.php?state_id=9 in the debug tool
[13:51:29] <robertmaxrees> so now https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c13vxtcw/6/
[13:52:18] <robertmaxrees> so first things first - let's use a jquery event binding to make this a little easier to work with.
[13:52:44] <FlyingPersian> okay
[13:52:56] <FlyingPersian> the only thing I really need is the city_id and city_name
[13:53:03] <FlyingPersian> because based on this later I can choose a clinic
[13:53:23] <robertmaxrees> so now - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c13vxtcw/10/
[13:53:28] <robertmaxrees> this is your issue, right?
[13:53:47] <robertmaxrees> change state, city dropdown gets the object object.
[13:53:53] <FlyingPersian> yes
[13:54:05] <FlyingPersian> it needs to be city_name
[13:54:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c13vxtcw/11/
[13:54:08] <robertmaxrees> so check this out.
[13:54:23] <robertmaxrees> if you look at your console, what do you see?
[13:54:31] <robertmaxrees> when you change that state dropdown
[13:55:01] <FlyingPersian> on jsfiddle or on localhost?
[13:55:07] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.
[13:55:21] <robertmaxrees> (i added a console.log to the latest fiddle)
[13:55:42] <FlyingPersian> do I need to use my browsers console or does the site have a console?
[13:55:52] <robertmaxrees> your browser's console
[13:56:41] <FlyingPersian> honestly there is no error
[13:56:52] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:56:54] <FlyingPersian> it just shows the stuff on line 70
[13:56:55] <FlyingPersian> 79
[13:56:59] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:57:05] <robertmaxrees> so what does this tell you?
[13:57:56] <FlyingPersian> what value is?
[13:58:01] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:58:17] <robertmaxrees> so if value is the entire object, and you need particular properties off that object, what do you do?
[13:58:31] <FlyingPersian> usually I'd do something like value[1] or something
[13:58:36] <FlyingPersian> not sure what the appropriate code is
[13:58:43] <robertmaxrees> not an array index.
[13:58:51] <robertmaxrees> if value is { city_id: "3", city_name: "Osnabrück", state_id: "9" }
[13:58:59] <robertmaxrees> how do you get city_name from it?
[13:59:18] <FlyingPersian> tbh I don't know
[13:59:25] <FlyingPersian> I tried playing around with this a little
[13:59:31] <robertmaxrees> can you show me what you tried?
[13:59:33] <FlyingPersian> and didn't find anything online
[13:59:37] <FlyingPersian> just value[1] and stuff
[13:59:41] <FlyingPersian> using indicies
[13:59:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so that's an object, not an array.
[14:00:00] <FlyingPersian> let me google how I can get specific parts of an object
[14:00:03] <robertmaxrees> so you'd do value.propertyname
[14:00:29] <FlyingPersian> getElementById
[14:00:30] <FlyingPersian> ?
[14:00:39] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:00:44] <robertmaxrees> value.propertyname
[14:00:46] <robertmaxrees> literally this.
[14:00:46] <FlyingPersian> oh
[14:00:48] <FlyingPersian> :D
[14:00:49] <FlyingPersian> okay
[14:00:55] <FlyingPersian> so value.city_name ?
[14:00:56] <robertmaxrees> where city_name is an example property name.
[14:01:01] <robertmaxrees> give it a shot and see what happens :)
[14:01:26] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:01:27] <FlyingPersian> damn
[14:01:32] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:01:32] <FlyingPersian> it works
[14:01:33] <FlyingPersian> :D
[14:01:35] <robertmaxrees> rad
[14:01:47] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:01:58] <FlyingPersian> okay
[14:01:59] <FlyingPersian> thanks!
[14:07:44] <FlyingPersian> now I also need it to select the right attribute, so that I have <option value="city_id">city_name</option>
[14:07:52] <FlyingPersian> I assume I need to change the attribute setting for that
[14:12:11] <robertmaxrees> "select the right attribute"?
[14:12:48] <FlyingPersian> naw ignore that
[14:12:52] <FlyingPersian> I was just bumbling :D
[14:12:59] <FlyingPersian> $('#city-list').append($('<option = "value.city_id>"')
[14:13:02] <FlyingPersian> I tried this, but it doesn't work
[14:13:22] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[14:13:36] <FlyingPersian> <option value="city_id">city_name</option>
[14:14:36] <FlyingPersian> it chooses cities based on the state_id
[14:14:37] <robertmaxrees> $('#city-list').append($('<option>').text(value.city_name).attr('value', value));
[14:14:40] <robertmaxrees> this is close.
[14:14:57] <FlyingPersian> I tried value.city_id in the end
[14:15:01] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[14:15:04] <FlyingPersian> hang on
[14:15:26] <FlyingPersian> https://jsfiddle.net/c13vxtcw/18/
[14:15:48] <FlyingPersian> oh snap
[14:15:55] <FlyingPersian> I need to add the new code first, hang on
[14:17:48] <FlyingPersian> https://jsfiddle.net/c13vxtcw/20/ <-- I've added the onChange here for the clinics
[14:18:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:18:07] <robertmaxrees> no onChange
[14:18:17] <robertmaxrees> $('#state-list').on('change', function() {
[14:18:29] <FlyingPersian> the problem is that http://localhost/test/review/getKlinik.php?city_id=%5Bobject%20Object%5D is empty
[14:18:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm also not seeing a function for getKlinik
[14:18:46] <FlyingPersian> yeah I'm adding it now
[14:18:53] <FlyingPersian> but I don't have any data
[14:18:57] <FlyingPersian> cuz it doesn't return anything
[14:19:00] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:19:06] <robertmaxrees> so then what are you trying to do?
[14:19:11] <FlyingPersian> okay let me back up
[14:19:20] <FlyingPersian> the last dropdown needs the city_id
[14:19:54] <FlyingPersian> which should be in <option value="city_id"> because once I choose an option, it knows the respective city_id, right?
[14:20:05] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:20:19] <FlyingPersian> so I need to tell it to append the <options> including the city_id
[14:20:27] <FlyingPersian> right now it appends object object
[14:20:38] <FlyingPersian> $('#city-list').append($('<option>').text(value.city_name).attr('value', value));
[14:20:49] <FlyingPersian> so I need to add something here for it for it to append the city_id
[14:21:07] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:21:13] <robertmaxrees> it'
[14:21:18] <robertmaxrees> *it's the same issue as before.
[14:21:36] <robertmaxrees> you do the same thing in .attr('value', value) that you did for that text.
[14:21:46] <FlyingPersian> yes
[14:21:47] <FlyingPersian> I did
[14:22:00] <FlyingPersian> I tried both 'value.city_id' and 'value', value.city_id
[14:22:05] <FlyingPersian> when I do the first, I get http://localhost/test/review/getKlinik.php?city_id=Osnabr%C3%BCck
[14:22:09] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[14:22:19] <FlyingPersian> hang on
[14:23:45] <FlyingPersian> https://jsfiddle.net/c13vxtcw/23/ <-- this is somewhat what it needs to look like
[14:23:48] <FlyingPersian> I need to change the var data though
[14:23:59] <robertmaxrees> so where's the issue?
[14:24:23] <robertmaxrees> and kill the onchange attributes.
[14:24:30] <FlyingPersian> in the HTML?
[14:24:32] <robertmaxrees> yes
[14:24:34] <FlyingPersian> okay
[14:24:36] <robertmaxrees> they'll cause issues.
[14:24:49] <robertmaxrees> $('#klinik-list').append($('<option>').text(value.klinik_name).attr('value', value)); you basically do the exact same thing here.
[14:24:59] <robertmaxrees> just that the value in that .attr() call needs the right property name.
[14:25:40] <FlyingPersian> https://jsfiddle.net/c13vxtcw/28/
[14:25:55] <FlyingPersian> I did that though
[14:26:00] <robertmaxrees> with what data?
[14:26:08] <FlyingPersian> well I did it on my local machine
[14:26:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:26:14] <FlyingPersian> I don't know what the data looks like
[14:26:23] <robertmaxrees> then you need to figure that part out.
[14:26:24] <FlyingPersian> it should be similar to the one in cities
[14:26:33] <FlyingPersian> just with different content
[14:26:34] <robertmaxrees> but with different property names, right?
[14:26:38] <FlyingPersian> yes
[14:26:49] <robertmaxrees> so what's the property name you want to use for the value attribute?
[14:27:21] <FlyingPersian> locally I did this: $('#klinik-list').append($('<option>').text(value.city_name).attr('value', value.city_id));
[14:27:34] <FlyingPersian> which gives me this: http://localhost/test/review/getKlinik.php?city_id=Osnabr%C3%BCck
[14:27:36] <robertmaxrees> right, when selecting from state-list
[14:27:41] <robertmaxrees> are you asking about city-list?
[14:27:50] <robertmaxrees> i'm super lost right now heh.
[14:27:50] <FlyingPersian> instead of saying Osnabrück, it should say the ID (e.g. 2)
[14:27:58] <FlyingPersian> no
[14:28:02] <FlyingPersian> when selecting the city
[14:28:18] <robertmaxrees> right, so you select a city - what's the issue?
[14:28:23] <FlyingPersian> so
[14:28:32] <FlyingPersian> I select a state --> it gives me the appropriate cities
[14:28:33] <robertmaxrees> $('#klinik-list').append($('<option>').text(value.klinik_name).attr('value', value)); - the "value" here doesn't have a property name set.
[14:28:38] <robertmaxrees> so you need to set thqat.
[14:28:49] <FlyingPersian> attr('value', value.city_id)); <-- like this?
[14:29:05] <robertmaxrees> is city_id coming back with the da3ta from that ajax call?
[14:29:09] <FlyingPersian> no
[14:29:12] <FlyingPersian> the city_name is coming back
[14:29:17] <FlyingPersian> http://localhost/test/review/getKlinik.php?city_id=Osnabr%C3%BCck
[14:29:19] <FlyingPersian> this is coming back
[14:29:24] <FlyingPersian> it should be http://localhost/test/review/getKlinik.php?city_id=4 or something
[14:29:40] <robertmaxrees> so you want the city ID from the dropdown itself?
[14:29:44] <FlyingPersian> no
[14:29:49] <FlyingPersian> I want the city_name in the dropdown
[14:29:57] <robertmaxrees> $(this).val();
[14:30:02] <robertmaxrees> actually.
[14:30:04] <FlyingPersian> but it option needs to have the city_id as well
[14:30:10] <FlyingPersian> *the
[14:30:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c13vxtcw/29/
[14:30:19] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[14:30:37] <robertmaxrees> err, that'll get you the IOD/.
[14:30:39] <robertmaxrees> *id
[14:30:51] <robertmaxrees> I gotta jet tho - late for a meeting.  i'll be back in a few hours.
[14:31:01] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)  checkout learn.jquery.com for some good tutorials btw.
[14:31:03] <FlyingPersian> okay
[14:31:09] <FlyingPersian> I'll try to be here then, thanks
[16:17:58] <Azrael_-> hi
[16:18:03] <Azrael_-> i try to follow this example: http://plnkr.co/edit/NePR0BQf3VmKtuMmhVR7?p=preview but i always get this js-error: "$ is not defined". can you give me a hint why and how i can solve this?
[16:27:52] <robertmaxrees> what a day
[16:29:28] <hassoon> robertmaxrees: how was it
[16:29:40] <robertmaxrees> it's still going.
[16:29:51] <robertmaxrees> only halfway through.
[16:30:08] <hassoon> i understand it's noon there
[16:30:14] <robertmaxrees> 1:30, but yeah
[16:30:19] * hassoon guesses robertmaxrees is in the west coast
[16:30:26] <robertmaxrees> yep :) norcal
[16:30:48] <hassoon> there you are
[16:31:12] <hassoon> you're coding something or what
[16:31:18] * hassoon guess it's an office
[16:31:26] <hassoon> guesses *
[16:31:34] <robertmaxrees> i mean, yeah.
[16:31:38] <robertmaxrees> most people in this room do that ;)
[16:31:44] <robertmaxrees> well, quite a few at least.
[18:22:58] <mdbm> hi
[18:23:08] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[18:24:37] <mdbm> I don't understand the brackets syntax in this code after closest('.form-group') => $('input[name=amount]').closest('.form-group')[is_shown ? 'addClass' : 'removeClass']('has-error');
[18:25:05] <mdbm> .closest) doesn't reutrn an array, how do these brackets work?
[18:25:08] <robertmaxrees> ah, easy :)
[18:25:22] <robertmaxrees> although that's a funny way to do it.
[18:25:35] <taplar> lol
[18:25:47] <taplar> someone trying to be fancy
[18:25:47] <robertmaxrees> okay so - you know about accessing properties using square brackets, yeah?
[18:25:55] <mdbm> yes
[18:26:03] <robertmaxrees> rad!
[18:26:04] <mdbm> but here it's a function... that's why I don't get it
[18:26:14] <robertmaxrees> functions are still objects :)(
[18:26:17] <robertmaxrees> * :)
[18:26:34] <robertmaxrees> addClass and removeClass are both properties on the jquery object.  so they use the same rules for accessing them.
[18:26:49] <mdbm> ah right i see
[18:26:56] <mdbm> thank you
[18:27:23] <taplar> i'd personally refactor that to make it more readable
[18:27:27] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[18:27:44] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/toggleclass/#toggleClass-className-state
[18:28:11] <robertmaxrees> $('input[name=amount]').closest('.form-group').toggleClass('has-error', is_shown);
[18:29:38] <mdbm> thank you:) easier to read indeed
[18:30:27] <robertmaxrees> o7
[18:45:18] <FlyingPersian|af> hi robertmaxrees
[18:49:40] <robertmaxrees> yo
[18:52:17] <taplar> fk you guys being that luvy duvy i'm going to ask you get your own room
[18:53:00] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[18:53:02] <robertmaxrees> this guy
[18:53:18] * taplar shrugs
[18:56:25] <FlyingPersian|af> I got it to work. I don't know why, but before adding city_id didn't work
[18:56:30] <FlyingPersian|af> but know it works fine
[18:56:33] <FlyingPersian|af> thanks a lot!
[18:57:03] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[19:04:08] <hassoon> what does being luvy duvy mean ?
[19:08:05] <FlyingPersian|af> some sentimental crap :P
[19:09:55] <ginseng> if i have a dom element #myElement and call a function that replaces it with an identical copy with .html, i'm noticing that functions that modify #myElement no longer work? In my case, I'm trying to focus() the element but it stops working after being replaced even though the element's ID is identical.
[19:10:21] <ginseng> what can i do to "refresh" this reference?
[19:42:20] <LooneyToons> << bangs head on desk
[19:44:51] <FlyingPersian> https://gist.github.com/FlyingPersian/77524e87bcd070dd45578f535bbf5856 <-- how can I make the function getCity reset the dropdown menus when selecting a different state?
[19:45:36] <FlyingPersian> when I add $('#city-list').empty(); it removes the "Select City" and breaks the third dropdown in terms of not making it being populated
[19:46:03] <FlyingPersian> the way the code now is I can select a state, then it lists respective cities, and when selecting a city it lists respective clinics
[19:46:32] <FlyingPersian> but as soon as I change a state or city it just further appends the cities or clinics, so the previously listed cities and clinics remain
