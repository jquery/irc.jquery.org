[00:02:29] <coldhead> that's a very normal question, antoon
[00:02:32] <coldhead> people do that all the time
[00:02:39] <coldhead> the secret is to use "event delegation"
[00:02:41] <coldhead> ?on
[00:02:42] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:02:47] <coldhead> as documented ^^
[00:03:19] <antoon> Interesting
[00:05:15] <antoon> The unawesome part is that it doesn't work as planned, coldhead :/
[00:07:47] <coldhead> you should have planned better then
[00:07:52] <coldhead> expect the unexpected!
[00:08:07] <antoon> Jesus man
[00:08:54] <antoon> It feels like sinceI retrieve the div using ajax, jquery doesn't know of it
[00:09:19] <coldhead> that's right
[00:09:45] <coldhead> but what you do is you say "hey jquery, this div i'm putting new ajax content in? if anyone clicks a "whatever" inside that div, here's what i want you to do"
[00:10:07] <coldhead> you delegate the event handler to the parent which is already in the page, and then it doesn't matter that its contents may be ajax loaded
[00:10:51] <antoon> Interesting
[00:11:11] <tw2113> $('.parent').on('click','.child_element_reloaded',function(e){ });
[00:11:43] <coldhead> beautifully put, tw2113
[00:11:58] * tw2113 copy/pasta'd from his own delegate useage
[00:12:33] <antoon> That actually makes sense.
[00:12:40] <antoon> Quick, to the workbench!
[00:12:48] <coldhead> you're darn tooting it makes sense
[00:12:53] <tw2113> i have a beautiful osx terminal :)
[00:13:07] <dblosevn> I have a beatuifl osx vm :-)
[00:13:16] <coldhead> i have a dot matrix printer
[00:13:26] <tw2113> http://d.pr/i/MOca
[00:13:34] <dblosevn> I have 7280x1080 resolution :-)
[00:13:55] <tw2113> look at all those colors
[00:14:00] <dblosevn> nice lol
[00:14:09] <tw2113> it's like my bash shits skittles
[00:14:13] <coldhead> it's like a bunch of LSD in my mouth and everyone's throwing up
[00:18:26] <aaas> so I understand that the best practice (recommendation?) is camelCase for js... is this applied to all vars? or is there a object/string distiction (objects get the camelCase, strings not)?
[00:18:59] <Cork> aaas: the normal case is always camel
[00:19:16] <tw2113> i'm not great with js coding standards
[00:19:22] <tw2113> but i also don't write enough js to memorize
[00:19:32] <aaas> Cork so strings should be cc too?
[00:19:44] <Cork> aaas: what do you mean by strings?
[00:20:14] <tw2113> i do recall that class constructors start with a capital
[00:20:30] <aaas> Cork so if i have someVar which is an object, but i have another var that is otherVar which is a string, would that be otherVar or othervar for the string?
[00:20:40] <Cork> firstly, it's conventions not hard standards
[00:20:48] <aaas> ok
[00:21:25] <Cork> you shouldn't have the same name for different things
[00:21:37] <Cork> and javascript is soft-typed
[00:21:41] <antoon> Thanks coldhead and tw2113. I do believe Jesus solved this
[00:21:44] <Cork> so you don't have a "string variable"
[00:21:50] <Cork> just a variable
[00:21:52] <tw2113> don't they flay you for not getting camelcase right?
[00:22:23] <Cork> aaas: a convention that do exist though is that in see camel case becomes -
[00:22:45] <Cork> so somethingsName becomes somethings-name
[00:22:50] <tw2113> coldhead is kind of saintlike
[00:22:52] <aaas> ok
[00:22:54] <aaas> thanks
[00:23:07] <Cork> and for prefixes you get ex -moz-value becomes MozValue
[00:23:33] <Cork> i kinda like that convention my self, so i follow it quite strictly
[00:23:51] <tw2113> anywho, my productive hours are over, and i am in the mood for some reading
[00:23:52] <tw2113> night all
[00:23:54] <Cork> but like all conventions, use them if they work for you, it doesn't really matter
[00:28:16] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:29:39] <dblosevn> my turn lol http://d.pr/i/XA3e Finally got my workstation maxed out :-) the eyefinity is nice too @ 7280x1080

[00:34:37] <ripthejacker> hi everyone
[00:35:25] <ripthejacker> I'm trying to learn jquery mobile and I can't find a solution to this problem.
[00:35:52] <ripthejacker> I am using the pageshow even to resize the divs to match the screen size.
[00:36:28] <ripthejacker> this works if I'm using the changepage event. But it doesn't work for the first page that's loaded
[00:39:16] <motaka2> is it better to append script to header or use getScript ?
[00:39:50] <Cork> motaka2: there is three ways to get scripts to the page
[00:40:08] <motaka2> Cork: Which one is better ?
[00:40:28] <Cork> but one thing that saves quite a bit is to concut the files into as far files as possible
[00:40:36] <Cork> cause that way you save http requests
[00:40:43] <Cork> and that costs quite a bit of time
[00:41:10] <Cork> secondly 1. add the scripts that needs to be loaded BEFORE the page parses (ex. jquery) to the head
[00:41:34] <Cork> 2. add scripts that can wait to load until after the page has rendered at the end of the body
[00:41:55] <Cork> scripts in the head blocks rendering of the page until they are loaded and parsed
[00:42:19] <Cork> 3. is to fetch scripts through js, but you should only do that for scripts you can't load statically
[00:42:30] <Cork> cause it normally cost more then it saves you
[00:42:56] <Cork> (there are a few resource management scripts, that might be of interest, but not from load speed standpoint)
[00:43:14] <Cork> more of a offloading script management from the server to the client
[00:43:29] <Cork> personally i find that to be a quite bad idea
[00:43:52] <motaka2> Cork: Cause I load my pages in ajax, I dont know which action requires which string till it is called , so I have to call them dinamically
[00:44:12] <motaka2> Cork: So my question is I should use append or getScript ?
[00:44:33] <Cork> i would prob use getscript and include the html in the script response
[00:45:02] <Cork> i find that cleaner then adding a script tag in an html response
[00:47:27] <motaka2> Cork: What about css, what's the best way to include css files ?
[00:47:43] <Cork> in the head
[00:48:01] <Cork> you want css files loaded as soon as possible to avoid extra reflows
[00:48:13] <Cork> and you should avoid loading extra dynamically
[00:48:21] <Cork> just add classes in the first one
[00:48:35] <ChristW1> Is there a way to see if an element is not visible (as in: scrolled off-view in a partially hidden HTML element) using jQuery? .is(":visible") does not work, since it is only hidden by a overflow: hidden parent...

[00:50:08] <kiuma> hello, I have a problem with fancybox. I have elements defined with <a class="gallery" rel="detail-gallery" title="craps.jpg" href="http...bigimageLnk.jpg"><img src="http...smallimageLnk.jpg"></a>
[00:50:12] <ripthejacker> need help with jquery mobile
[00:50:30] <ripthejacker> pageshow event is not fired on the first page load
[00:50:39] <ChristW1> Cork: Does this also work for elements hidden by their parents?
[00:50:56] <ripthejacker> but if I navigate to same page from different page , pageshow works fine.
[00:51:09] <Cork> ChristW1: you would have to test that you're self
[00:51:25] <kiuma> I call $('.gallery').fancybox({...}); but if I click on an image link no fancy box appears and the image is opened
[00:51:33] <kiuma> pleas help
[00:51:44] <motaka2> Cork: so when I dont know for a request which css I need the best way is to use:  $("head").append('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
[00:51:51] <motaka2> ?
[00:52:11] <Cork> motaka2: no, you should load the css files you need statically; like i said
[00:52:32] <Cork> as there isn't any unload features for css, you will have to scope them anyway
[00:52:33] <ChristW1> Cork: Will test, thanks for the pointer!
[00:52:49] <motaka2> Cork: I cant do that. I told you since I am in ajax mode I dont know what css file is needed per request
[00:53:05] <Cork> no, i don't get what that has to do with anything
[00:53:12] <dblosevn> I hate it when my browser jumps into AJAX mode ...
[00:53:16] <Cork> just add all the sites css into one file
[00:53:27] <Cork> have a set of classes for the different features, and use the classes
[00:53:33] <Cork> loading css files won't work
[00:53:43] <Cork> as they will constantly conflict
[00:54:25] <Cork> motaka2: the css you load won't be restricted to the html you loaded through an ajax call
[00:54:30] <Cork> it will affect the entire page
[00:55:02] <Cork> and the specification rank system will pick what rules will apply
[00:55:08] <Cork> it will be quite horrible
[00:55:08] <dblosevn> Ya Id namespace the css with an id on the parent re ... #product ul { ... } #category ul { ... } and make the outerwrapper of the ajax content have that id
[00:55:22] <Cork> eh...
[00:55:25] <Cork> preferably not
[00:55:30] <Cork> as most of the time you don't need to
[00:55:39] <Cork> but ya, that is one way to do it
[00:55:50] <dblosevn> for the things that are different from page to page
[00:55:57] <dblosevn> the common elements just use classes
[00:55:59] <aaas> i have an click function animation, but i want to wait for the animation completes before allowing another click, what is the best way to acomplish this.  delay() would allow a stack up in the queue (which i dont want), i could use a bool and find out where the object is to see if it the animation has completed, but is there a better way
[00:56:12] <Cork> you're better of writeing class rules for the specific situations instead of for pages
[00:56:21] <fabioportieri> aaas: use the animation callback
[00:56:23] <Cork> it makes much more sense when managing the site
[00:56:39] <aaas> fabioportieri what in particular?
[00:56:41] <fabioportieri> to rebind the click
[00:57:03] <fabioportieri> aaas: i would unbind the click as soon as the animation starts and rebind it in the callback when it's finishd
[00:57:06] <dblosevn> re: for a block layout that will only be used on the product page ever
[00:57:16] <aaas> fabioportieri ok thanks ill look into it
[00:57:18] <Cork> aaas: if($(this).is(':animate')) { return; }
[00:57:28] <Cork> the callback won't help you block the click event
[00:57:45] <Cork> ?:animate

[00:57:52] <aaas> Cork thanks
[00:57:54] <Cork> opps :x
[00:57:59] <Cork> its :animated not :animate
[01:10:41] <kiuma> is there an alternative to fancybox ?
[01:11:12] <kiuma> I've no console errors. but I continue to have fb not working
[01:11:41] <kiuma> as if $(.gallery).fancybox(); has nevever been called
[01:13:36] <fabioportieri> paste code
[01:21:56] <motaka2> I believe my pages must load in ajax mode but I think it seems they dont - is there anything wrong?  http://codepaste.net/ujj3wm
[01:22:33] <bogdaniel> i'm trying to add new fields to an input but each time a new field is added it goes bellow the submit button any ideeas what i can do to stop this thing?
[01:24:27] <kiuma> fabioportieri, http://pastebin.com/CTDb2mYr then I call from firebug $('.gallery').fancybox();
[01:24:45] <kiuma> no errors, no warnings, no fancybox :(
[01:25:35] <motaka2> kiuma: Do u whats wrong with mine ?
[01:26:24] <fabioportieri> kiuma: i don't see the js, try to put yout call inside a document.ready
[01:27:16] <andkore>     $.post("index.php", etc <-- how does that work? $.post. I thought $ had to select something
[01:27:57] <fabioportieri> andkore: is a shortcut for $.ajax
[01:28:13] <andkore> fabioportieri: right, but how does that work?
[01:28:18] <kiuma> fabioportieri, ok
[01:28:58] <fabioportieri> andkore: by calling the jquery method post...
[01:29:16] <kiuma> motaka2, are you sure you can $("head").append('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="' + data.cssPaths[cssCounter] + '"></link>'); ?
[01:29:24] <fabioportieri> $ is the object, .post is the method
[01:29:41] <kiuma> I think it will be ignored
[01:29:52] <motaka2> kiuma: yes, whats wrong with it ?
[01:30:10] <kiuma> simply you can't do that
[01:30:13] <andkore> fabioportieri: is it a class? if it's an object then doesn't it have to be instantiated?
[01:30:22] <andkore> I'll do some googling, don't mind me
[01:31:35] <motaka2> no kiuma it is working, it shows me the pages, I just think it is not ajax
[01:32:02] <ohcibi> a friend from amsterdam of mine wrote "AJAX!!!" on his facebook page yesterday.. i replied "HTML".. he liked
[01:32:08] <kiuma> it shows you the link but the css is not parsed
[01:32:40] <motaka2> kiuma: I see the styles
[01:33:09] <kiuma> but your browser' render engine doesn't
[01:33:39] <motaka2> kiuma: What should I do ?
[01:35:06] <kiuma> motaka2, http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/loadjavascriptcss.shtml
[01:37:06] <kiuma> fabioportieri, http://pastebin.com/CXkBarN6
[01:37:39] <motaka2> kiuma: I am using the same method
[01:37:49] <lemonsparrow> I have a java map and I want to pass this key value data set to javascript.. can I convert the map into java and pass it? if so how to convert it the map into json ?
[01:38:09] <kiuma> motaka2, .append(string ) is not the same methood !
[01:38:18] <kiuma> *method
[01:38:23] <motaka2> what instead then ?
[01:38:45] <kiuma> lemonsparrow, yes, use json.org
[01:39:31] <kiuma> motaka2, plain js would be document.createElement("link") ... as in the example
[01:40:21] <kiuma> in jq I think it should be $('<link>', {....}).appendTo(headElement);
[01:41:57] <motaka2> kiuma: so why my app finds and renders the css
[01:43:31] <kiuma> motaka2, you should manage the document as a document and not as a plain text. then you can do whatever you prefer :)
[01:44:19] <motaka2> kiuma: lemme check
[01:46:43] <motaka2> kiuma: $('<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="' + data.cssPaths[cssCounter] + '"></link>').appendTo("head");  is the same for me and it seems that the whole page refreshes
[01:48:11] <kiuma> nooooo
[01:48:23] <freannrak> I'm trying to do some client-side form verification upon Submit by preventing the default action, but I'm not sure how I can resume the default event upon successful validation. http://dpaste.de/Yw8Ho/
[01:48:32] <kiuma> first there is no </link> !˘
[01:48:56] <kiuma> then what do you exactly want to do ?
[01:49:00] <motaka2> kiuma: When I comment the lines about css and js loading , I can see XHR request in firebug but when I uncomment them it seems the whole page is refreshing
[01:49:30] <kiuma> we are going nowhere ! what do you want to do ?
[01:51:05] <motaka2> kiuma: I am using an MVC system for some of my links I want to get the html for those links and not the whole layout, calling each action of a controller  will need some js and css files, I want first to load thos js and css files and then put the returning HTML in #main
[01:52:12] <ludwigz> freannrak: maybe using onsubmit=false and then submiting the form as you do in your function?
[01:53:16] <motaka2> kiuma: When I comment the lines regarding css and js files in that js file, I can load returning html using XHR request but when I uncomment those lines , it seems the whole page is loading
[01:54:31] <kiuma> motaka2, you'll have a lot of problems. first of all multiple definitions of the same css. Anyway after you have loaded and replaced your css
[01:54:55] <motaka2> kiuma: So what should I do ?
[01:56:02] <kiuma> try $('<link>', {rel:'stylesheet', ...}).appendTo(previouslyExtractedHeadElement);
[02:05:50] <motaka2> kiuma: this is not my problem
[02:14:42] <lejocelyn> in which, with the $.ajax() method, neither the success and the error events are activated ?
[02:15:04] <lejocelyn> is there a third way?
[02:18:02] <motaka2> What is the diffrence between append and appento ?
[02:19:21] <lejocelyn> ('<p>text to appento</p>').appendto("div");
[02:19:45] <lejocelyn> ("div").append("<p>text to be appened</p>");
[02:19:51] <lejocelyn> is it clear ?
[02:19:54] <lejocelyn> motaka2: ?
[02:20:13] <motaka2> lejocelyn: I know, no other difference ?
[02:20:27] <motaka2> Why have they invented this ?
[02:20:42] <lejocelyn> conveniance ?
[02:24:14] <motaka2> lejocelyn, I am becoming mad
[02:25:00] <lejocelyn> motaka2: don't tell me, I've some strange behaviours I really don't understand with $()/
[02:25:29] <lejocelyn> with $("[name='email']").val();
[02:26:01] <lejocelyn> in one context, it doesn't work the way I'd like it to and I really don't understand why
[02:26:12] <lejocelyn> why [name='birth_year'].val(); works everywhere
[02:26:14] <lejocelyn> :D
[02:26:27] <lejocelyn> s/why/while/ ;
[02:31:21] <lejocelyn> for an $.ajax function, if dataType is 'json', can you do that : success: function(data, textStatus, jqXHR) {if(!data.email){echo "yes";}} //  the json looks like [{"email":"jocelyn.aznar@ecopas.fr"}]
[02:31:29] <lejocelyn> ?
[02:32:12] <Abbas|> anyone came across 'videoplayer is too small' error on youtube embeds in smaller divs?
[02:40:04] <JohnBo> Hey im making an if-statement, just wondering if this is legit code: $("img[data-hires]").attr('data-hires').length > 0 ?
[02:40:27] <JohnBo> I only want the function to function (hah) when the attribute hires has a value
[02:40:54] <Cork> yes it is
[02:41:33] <JohnBo> Then why is it not working? :( The hires attribute is empty still it runs the function after the if statement
[02:42:26] <Cork> what is $("img[data-hires]").length ?
[02:44:47] <JohnBo> An attribute in an img-tag, I managed to solve this backend tho, thanks anyways :)
[02:45:04] <Cork> no...
[02:45:13] <Cork> i meant what is the response from that call?
[02:45:33] <Cork> attr will return the first element
[02:45:42] <Cork> *'s attribute value
[02:46:21] <Cork> (why o, why is ' placed next to the enter key >_<)
[02:50:26] <Aamir> :D

[02:51:09] <lejocelyn> I'm not sure to understand properly, when you have the success event in an $.ajax(), the arguments of the anonymous function called, can you call them as you want ? how do you know their numbers ?
[02:51:34] <lolmaus> Cork, thank you ^__^
[02:51:47] <Cork> lejocelyn: yes, just like any other functions
[02:51:49] <lejocelyn> when I read http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/, I can see success : Function( PlainObject data, String textStatus, jqXHR jqXHR )
[02:52:30] <lejocelyn> if I give one argument, it will always be data
[02:52:37] <lejocelyn> two, data and textStatus
[02:52:46] <lejocelyn> three jqXHR
[02:52:46] <Cork> lejocelyn: you can name the arguments, just like any other functions
[02:54:11] <lejocelyn> can I name them data, textStatus and jqXHR ?
[02:54:25] <Cork> you can name them a, b, c if you like
[02:54:35] <Cork> or x,y,z
[02:54:37] <Cork> or what ever
[02:54:53] <Cork> it's argument declaration, it's up to you
[02:54:53] <lejocelyn> the question is about name collision
[02:54:59] <Cork> there is none
[02:55:03] <lejocelyn> ok
[02:55:07] <Cork> it's two different name scopes
[02:56:19] <lejocelyn> so that's not the reason why success's function isn't called :(
[02:56:37] <Cork> add an error callback and check what it tells you
[02:56:45] <lejocelyn> nothing
[02:56:51] <lejocelyn> it tells me nothing
[02:56:56] <Cork> it's not called either?
[02:57:02] <lejocelyn> it's not being called
[02:57:11] <Cork> ?p @ lejocelyn

[02:59:50] <lejocelyn> Cork: I can't make something workable : http://jsfiddle.net/KVWPa/
[03:01:13] <Cork> have you checked that the ajax call is actually made?
[03:01:23] <lejocelyn> yes, it works well
[03:01:45] <Cork> have you tried replacing the $.ajax call with a minimalistic one?
[03:01:58] <lejocelyn> [{"email":"jocar@something.fr"}]
[03:02:10] <lejocelyn> not yet
[03:02:41] <Cork> $.ajax({ url:'', dataType:'json' }).done(function() { console.log("i'm done"); }).fail(function() { console.log("i fail"); });
[03:03:23] <Cork> might as well add an .always(function() { console.log("i'm always around"); }); too

[03:07:06] <lejocelyn> Cork: strange, the get request is sent
[03:07:13] <lejocelyn> but nothing in the console
[03:07:17] <lolmaus> Cork, you're awesome
[03:07:29] <Cork> lejocelyn: what does the browser console say?
[03:07:41] <Cork> specially the net tab
[03:09:14] <lejocelyn> The API for logging (console.log, console.info, console.warn, console.error) was disabled by a script on that page.
[03:09:24] <lejocelyn> (it's a translatation)
[03:09:26] <lejocelyn> :(
[03:09:50] <lejocelyn> could firebug disables console.logging
[03:09:52] <lejocelyn> ?
[03:10:05] <Cork> no, but features in a page might
[03:10:12] <Cork> try reloading the page that normally fixes it
[03:10:24] <Cork> though that said, you want to check the request, not the log
[03:11:24] <lejocelyn> but I didn't disable console.log, might be a firefox extension
[03:11:54] <lejocelyn> I reloaded the page and it didn't fix it
[03:12:19] <Cork> do you have a link?
[03:12:37] <lejocelyn> not yet :(
[03:14:02] <Gorkyman_HQ> hey guys, whats the preferred way for extending some core function?
[03:14:15] <lejocelyn> it's like the  email = $("[name='email']").val(); that doesn't work, I have no clue why
[03:14:41] <darkmutt> hi everybody;p
[03:14:51] <Cork> Gorkyman_HQ: $.fn.newFeature = function() {};
[03:15:54] <lejocelyn> Cork: according to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2787180/jquery-ajax-success-callback-function-not-executed, it's probably a mal formed json
[03:16:16] <Cork> lejocelyn: no error would be called if that was the case
[03:27:38] <duderion> hi guys, could you tell me how to read out the mouseposition while pressing the left button and moving around ?
[03:34:41] <roj> hi
[03:35:01] <roj> hmmm
[03:35:35] <roj> what is that? can someone tell plz?
[03:36:30] <mac_nibblet> How do i listen to any change to a input value ?
[03:36:38] <mac_nibblet> .change() only fires when focus is lost
[03:40:12] <Cork> mac_nibblet: keydown, keypress and keyup
[03:40:24] <Cork> and in modern browsers input
[03:44:16] <lemonsparrow> I want to use a js object for my jquery autocomplete function.. I would like to load strings in display but when I submit the form.. the corresponding ID should be passed.. how to do it ?
[03:44:44] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you would have to have two fields
[03:44:54] <Cork> one that is the autocomplete, and one that is hidden
[03:45:26] <lemonsparrow> Cork: any other way I can implement this without using hidden fields ?
[03:45:50] <mbor> is it possible to make $.when() sequential so that the second param only fires when the first param has resolved
[03:45:57] <Cork> well you could have it autocomplete and when they make an option you add the id in the field
[03:46:13] <Cork> but then the user would have to remove the id to make a new search
[03:46:36] <Cork> mbor: $.when isn't triggering anything
[03:46:41] <Cork> it listens for results
[03:47:00] <Cork> you have to make the source sequential if you want it
[03:47:12] <Cork> suspect in this case it's ajax calls
[03:47:33] <mbor> Cork: it's ajax calls, yes
[03:48:03] <Cork> mbor: so you would have to chain the calls, so you make the call second call from the first ones done callback
[03:48:19] <mbor> Cork: right, ok, that's what I wanted to avoid. oh well :P
[03:48:33] <Cork> there is no other way
[03:48:50] <mbor> Cork: fair enough :) thx for quick response
[03:48:52] <Cork> $.when just gets a list of references for callbacks from the already triggered ajax call
[03:49:18] <Cork> it has no control over them (sure it could abort them, but you don't know the order they will fire)
[03:50:08] <mbor> Cork: I see, I actually thought it was sequentiel to begin with
[03:50:46] <Cork> well the request is
[03:50:51] <Cork> but the response isn't
[03:50:58] <Cork> as it depends on network latency
[03:51:05] <mbor> ok
[03:51:09] <mbor> thx again
[03:59:55] <lemonsparrow> Cork: this is my code... https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5531827 line 4 was first string array so it was easy now it is object kinda key-value pair so now I am kinda lost how to get it working
[04:00:29] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I want the values to be loaded in autocomplete but on selection the ids should be passed... and I want to do it without using hidden field
[04:01:04] <Cork> $('#revisedPub').val(time.value);
[04:01:17] <Cork> to that in the select event
[04:01:33] <lemonsparrow> Cork: could u pls update my code ?
[04:01:42] <lemonsparrow> Cork: that will be easy for me to understand.. thanks
[04:01:46] <Cork> uh, it's a code dump
[04:01:50] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-select'
[04:01:54] <Cork> *http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-select
[04:02:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: i got it.. but what does  $('#revisedPub').val(time.value); mean ?
[04:03:10] <Cork> when a user selects an option in the autocomplete dropdown
[04:03:27] <Cork> you in select replaces the display value with the id in the #revisedPub input field
[04:03:55] <Cork> ex { text: "display value", value: 10 }
[04:04:05] <Cork> the input field will show 10 after the autocomplete closes
[04:04:09] <lemonsparrow> Cork: instead of that can I pass the id to server without having to show it to user ?
[04:04:20] <newtothis> hi i'm new to this :) i was wondering, if i could pass to $("#something a").click(?) somehow either the content of the href or their id somehow? or must i write this line for every link separately?
[04:04:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork: from background.. call some on submit method ?
[04:04:22] <Cork> you can do an ajax call
[04:04:29] <Cork> no you can't
[04:04:36] <Cork> that is what the input fields are for
[04:05:12] <lemonsparrow> Cork: what is time in time.value ?
[04:05:25] <Cork> time?
[04:05:30] <Cork> item not time
[04:05:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: isnt it pub_list ?
[04:05:38] <Cork> and it's in the ui.item.value
[04:05:48] <Cork> it depends on how you format your list
[04:05:56] <Cork> it's not predefined
[04:06:09] <Cork> newtothis: click will give you a this variable
[04:06:21] <Cork> it will contain the reference to the link element
[04:06:30] <newtothis> Cork, oh I see, thanks! :)
[04:06:33] <Cork> newtothis: also you most likely want to use delegate there
[04:06:57] <Cork> $('#something').on('click', 'a', function() { $(this).attr('href') })
[04:07:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: could u pls update my code https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/5531827 that will help me understand it better
[04:07:12] <Cork> its a pb, no i can't
[04:07:18] <Cork> ?p
[04:07:19] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:07:50] <newtothis> Cork, is it purely for style or some other reason?
[04:07:54] <lemonsparrow> Cork: pb ?
[04:08:17] <Cork> newtothis: the second solution binds one event listener on the #something element, and listens for bubbling events
[04:08:30] <newtothis> Cork, I see, thank you! :)
[04:08:39] <Cork> newtothis: $('#something a') loops over all the a's in the #something element and binds one listener for each one of them
[04:09:05] <Cork> you want to reduce the number of event listeners when you can, and this sounds like a really good example of when it fitts well
[04:09:30] <Cork> lemonsparrow: it's a dead PasteBin dump
[04:09:36] <newtothis> Cork, I see, thanks!
[04:17:26] <lemonsparrow> Cork: how to fetch the key corresponding to a particular value from a javascript object... si there an api for it ?
[04:17:57] <Cork> you mean get a list of all the keys?
[04:20:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork: no
[04:20:38] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I have {1 : a, 2: b} so I want to get 2 by passing b
[04:20:50] <Cork> obj[1]
[04:21:01] <Cork> or obj.1 if it was a value
[04:21:13] <Cork> wasn't a value i mean
[04:21:38] <Cork> ?eval var a = { 1: 'a', b:10 }; a[1]
[04:21:42] <bot-t> Cork: "a"
[04:21:43] <Cork> ?eval var a = { 1: 'a', b:10 }; a.1
[04:21:44] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[04:21:53] <Cork> ?eval var a = { 1: 'a', b:10 }; a['b']
[04:21:54] <bot-t> Cork: 10
[04:21:56] <Cork> ?eval var a = { 1: 'a', b:10 }; a.b
[04:21:57] <bot-t> Cork: 10
[04:28:15] <xec_> Cork: i think he meant the other way around, how to get the key name from value
[04:28:45] <Cork> hmm
[04:28:48] <Cork> ah
[04:29:12] <Cork> then no not really
[04:29:28] <Cork> you would have to loop the object to find the value and then use the key you used to find the value
[04:29:30] <xec_> you'd have to loop through and compare i guess
[04:30:27] <Trical> can I put this "onclick=foo()" ina a href ?
[04:30:35] <xec_> god no
[04:30:39] * xec_ shudders
[04:30:53] <Cork> Trical: no you can't
[04:31:20] <Trical> but I can if I put data role button
[04:31:20] <xec_> well, you can, but it's not likely to do what you want ;D
[04:31:28] * Cork wish the inline event attribute could just have been flagged with a warning everytime enyone used them...
[04:31:34] <Trical> <a data-role="button" onclick="loginUser();">
[04:31:39] <Trical> this works
[04:31:53] <Cork> an attribute called onclick and value in href isn't the same thing...
[04:32:14] <Trical> kkkk
[04:32:16] <seutje> for the love of the global scope!
[04:32:27] * xec_ sits back with some popcorn
[04:32:39] <seutje> I like to call the global scope Narnia
[04:32:50] <Trical> can I just add a link to nothing and but the onlcick as attribute
[04:33:13] <Cork> Trical: if you don't need a link, don't use a link
[04:33:18] <xec_> Trical: if it is a link to nothing, what makes it a link?
[04:33:41] <Cork> <span class="link" tabindex="0" onclick="clicke-click"></span>
[04:33:53] <Cork> and then style it in your css file
[04:33:53] <Trical> Cork, xec_ http://i.imgur.com/Xc04ZWk.png
[04:34:04] <Cork> <span class="link" tabindex="0" onclick="clicke-click"></span> <--
[04:34:09] <Cork> --> <span class="link" tabindex="0" onclick="clicke-click"></span> <--
[04:34:23] <xec_> konfucious say: if nothing to point to, use not anchor pointer
[04:34:25] <Cork> don't abuse the link tag, there is no need for it
[04:34:50] <xec_> konfucious say: if button want, button make
[04:34:54] <seutje> stairwells to nowhere
[04:35:40] <xec_> konfucious say: if not part of content, not make part of html, generate with js!
[04:35:58] <Cork> eh...
[04:36:07] <Cork> i don't really agree there
[04:36:21] <Cork> if things can be in the html, there is no need to make it depend on js
[04:36:23] <seutje> confucius say: MY NAME ISN'T KONFUCIOUS!!!
[04:36:49] <Trical> i'm going to hell
[04:36:51] <seutje> if there's no no-js fallback, there's no need for it to be there onload
[04:37:17] <seutje> if there is, it's probably a link
[04:37:30] <quietschie> hi
[04:38:46] <Trical> the reason for not making it a button is because then it doesn't style right, I guess I should just fix that then..
[04:38:47] <quietschie> i read about delegate()...is this a way to register an event with an element, that will be created some time by another js function?
[04:39:21] <newtothis> ah this might sound kinda odd but can i add arbitrary attributes to <a href ...> and just ask for them with .attr() ?
[04:39:26] <xec_> Trical: it really depends on the context, but if it isn't a link, don't use an <a>
[04:39:54] <Cork> quietschie: that is what delegate is for, among other things
[04:39:58] <quietschie> newtothis: yes, you can
[04:40:00] <xec_> seutje: konfucious not know how to spell name
[04:40:13] <Cork> quietschie: bind it on an existing element, and then use the delegate selector to select the target
[04:40:18] <seutje> xec_: at least not the transliterated version :P
[04:40:30] <newtothis> quietschie but would it be considered a good practice or a terrible idea? :)
[04:41:15] <xec_> newtothis: bad idea
[04:41:20] <quietschie> newtothis: depends on the context of your work, i guess
[04:41:29] <xec_> newtothis: use html5 data-* attributes for arbitrary data
[04:41:51] <newtothis> xec_, quierschie, thanks guys :)
[04:42:37] <quietschie> Cork: so i need a existing element, could also be document?
[04:42:48] <Cork> yes
[04:43:19] <quietschie> ok, thanks, i'll report if i could do it right
[04:43:20] <introom> hi. guys. I am sending a nested json object via ajax
[04:43:35] <introom> how could I decode it as a nested dict on the server side?
[04:43:57] <Cork> introom: are you sending json or a javascript object?
[04:55:32] <untaken> what is the best way to seperate checkboxes? I want to use jQuery(':checkbox').change( function () {   ...  but only on certain checkboxes, how would I achieve this? How do I diffientate them?
[04:55:57] <Cork> untaken: group them through classes
[04:56:04] <untaken> ok thanks
[04:56:22] <untaken> Cork: then how would I access them then, changing that code above>?
[04:56:40] <Cork> $('.group:checked')
[04:57:15] <Cork> remeber though :checked and change most likely doesn't make sense
[04:57:30] <untaken> what do you mean?
[04:57:40] <Cork> as you will bind change listners only to checkboxes that is checked when the code runs
[04:57:49] <motaka2> Cork: Hello in this page when the use clicks on edit apeared infront of "heads" it is supposed to load the next page ajax, but after a while it seems it loads the whole page, can anyone tell me why ? http://fa.noondreams.com/Ezr/Deps
[04:57:50] <Cork> oh, wait sorry
[04:58:00] <Cork> i read wrong its :checkbox not :checked :)
[04:58:13] <Cork> untaken: so scratch that comment
[04:58:56] <untaken> ok :) thanks
[05:02:36] <untaken> Cork: how would I use this then with a class find('input:checkbox')   would it be like this find('input.group:checkbox')
[05:02:45] <untaken> is that syntax correct?
[05:02:57] <Cork> yes
[05:03:04] <untaken> fantastic, cheers ;)
[05:03:07] <Cork> though the input part isn't needed
[05:03:22] <Cork> it's built into :checkbox, no need to check for it twice
[05:03:25] <quietschie> is there a straight-forward way to determine an element by it's absolute location?
[05:03:40] <Cork> no
[05:03:44] <xec_> and if the group class is only used for the checkboxes, all you need is ".group"
[05:03:55] <quietschie> thanks
[05:05:33] <Qdest> How can I get the css top value in decimals? I've tried parseIn($('.div').css('top'), 10); and parseFloat and whenever it's 0 it's NaN. How would I get 0?
[05:06:27] <seutje> motaka2: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of null Ezr.js:17

[05:07:48] <Cork> Qdest: try parseFloat
[05:07:57] <Qdest> also gave me NaN
[05:08:05] <Lucaszz> Hi!
[05:08:40] <Lucaszz> Are any possibilities to create/set global variable by "name" (name is string)
[05:08:41] <Lucaszz> ?
[05:09:21] <Cork> window['name'] = 1;
[05:09:28] <Cork> window.name = 1;
[05:09:29] <motaka2> seutje: how can I prevent this ?
[05:09:30] <Cork> :)
[05:10:25] <seutje> motaka2: have the server serve an empty array instead or check its type first
[05:11:34] <motaka2> seutje: the second is this right?  if (typeof data.cssPaths !== "null")
[05:12:24] <seutje> nope

[05:12:51] <Qdest> Cork ¬ª Perhaps it would be easier if I could show you what I'm getting this? -- http://jsfiddle.net/dzcqf/ :: what I am trying to do is the same thing that happens when you hit "up" when you're at the top, but at the bottom. Right now it allows to scroll "more" than it should be possible.
[05:12:51] <motka2> I wanna rule the Inter-net!
[05:13:42] <Cork> Qdest: sorry gtg
[05:13:52] <Qdest> All right, thanks tho!
[05:14:04] <Qdest> seutje ¬ª wanna give it a go? :)
[05:14:46] <Qdest> Come on Steve, help me out :D
[05:14:55] <motka> how can I help?
[05:15:16] <Qdest> You can help me figure out my logic on this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/dzcqf/
[05:15:29] <seutje> Qdest: WAT?!
[05:15:43] <Qdest> "up" works as intended, "down" doesn't. First problem is that it allows to 'scroll' too far. Second problem is how I'd get such an animation I have for top when at "top"!
[05:15:46] <motka> I am looking for a person with this name: Johannes Hiemer
[05:15:49] <motka> he here?
[05:16:32] * Qdest pokes at gru Steve
[05:17:04] <motka> Steve is dead
[05:17:17] <seutje> o.O
[05:17:26] <seutje> u talkin' to me?
[05:17:27] <motka> I mean the original steve
[05:17:30] <Qdest> seutje ¬ª yes actually I am :D
[05:17:36] <motka> all other steve's are just copies
[05:17:41] <motka> :P
[05:18:01] <seutje> steve doesn't own an "are"
[05:18:12] <seutje> god I wish u could collapse fiddle's left sidebar
[05:18:27] <motka> yes you can
[05:18:39] <motka> use DOM
[05:18:50] <seutje> how? besides adding display none to it and remove the margin from the content?
[05:19:10] <lolmaus> I'm making my first steps in JS and jQuery. I've succesfully solved my task (creating tabs) but i'm not sure whether my code is any close to being optimal. Could you please review and suggest any improvements? http://jsbin.com/ivinej/4/edit
[05:19:27] <motka> well... screw it around, play it down... you'll get to do it completely!
[05:19:47] <motka> lolmaus I will do a review
[05:20:29] <seutje> Qdest: any particular reason ur using floats for px values?
[05:20:43] <lolmaus> motka, yay, thank you! Should i repost to some place with comments? Gist.github.com maybe?
[05:20:49] <motka> lolmaus - WoW!
[05:20:59] <motka> all this code just to control tabs?
[05:21:12] <Qdest> seutje ¬ª as you can see from all my debug clutter, I've been experimenting with position().top, offset().top and css('top') - only css gives me the correct value that I'd like to limit the scroll "down" to somehow.
[05:21:32] <seutje> so... no?
[05:21:35] <Qdest> no
[05:21:36] <Qdest> :D
[05:21:56] <Lucaszz> I just want to set global variable. Global variable should be setted by varable's name with is string. What im doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/Zx3CijgA
[05:22:22] <seutje> Qdest: what does stopPos represent?
[05:22:39] <motka> it stops Position xD
[05:22:43] <seutje> visibleHeight - totalHeight... isn't that inherently negative ?
[05:22:51] <motka> stops the fabric of spacetime
[05:23:49] <Qdest> seutje ¬ª they're attempts at finding something to limit the top position
[05:24:44] <Lucaszz> Cork: Any ideas?
[05:24:57] <Qdest> It's probably really easy it's just that I've fiddled so much with it my logic is.. well, it isn't really logic
[05:25:03] <Qdest> +al
[05:29:05] <Qdest> seutje ¬ª I think I was in the line of thinking "stopPos" may not be lower than "topPos"
[05:30:01] <Qdest> put I got stuck because topPos at 0 is NaN and so the "check" fails
[05:35:17] <seutje> Qdest:
[05:35:18] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/dzcqf/1/
[05:35:35] <seutje> changed the NaN issue to fallback to 0
[05:35:49] <seutje> changed the condition for down to if (scroller.hasClass('down') && (totalHeight - visibleHeight + topPos) > 0)
[05:36:00] <seutje> well, only changed the second part, obviously
[05:37:17] <Qdest> seutje ¬ª amazing. thank you! I didn't know you could just add "or" 0 to the var definition like that. Thanks a lot, again!
[05:37:43] <seutje> Qdest: yeah, OR and AND work kinda funky with assignments in JS
[05:38:07] <seutje> basically, && means the last, || means the first
[05:38:57] <seutje> yeah, that was a shitty explanation :/
[05:41:27] <lx-berlin_> Does anyone know if there is a way to make the movement of jquerui draggable more smoothly ? If you move the element slowly, it looks ok. But if you make fast mouse movements, it looks really uneven.
[05:41:56] <seutje> Qdest: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#Logical_operators
[05:44:21] <seutje> Qdest: u gotta know ur truthy/falsy values though
[05:46:29] <Qdest> Oh thanks seutje really appreciate it! Now it kinda works as I want it to! http://jsfiddle.net/dzcqf/2/
[05:47:19] <seutje> Qdest: I'd also change ur floats to integers btw
[05:47:36] <Qdest> parseInt(.., 10)?
[05:47:38] <seutje> no need for sub-pixel accuracy  :P
[05:47:40] <seutje> yesh
[05:47:50] <Lucaszz> please help me :(
[05:49:02] <seutje> Lucaszz: window['$.jqPlotChart.functionsList'] = 5; => window.$.jqPlotChart.functionsList = 5; OR window['$'].jqPlotChart.functionsList = 5;
[05:49:19] <seutje> OR window['$']['jqPlotChart']['functionsList'] = 5;
[05:49:44] <seutje> Lucaszz: basically, '$.jqPlotChart.functionsList' isn't a single key to a value
[05:50:16] <seutje> $ is an object that has a property called jqPlotChart, which in term has a property called functionsList
[05:50:47] <shwaiil> hey
[05:52:17] <Lucaszz> seutje: TypeError: window.$ is undefined
[05:52:31] <seutje> Lucaszz: use window.jQuery
[05:52:39] <seutje> $ is probably being fed to ur IIFE
[05:52:40] <shwaiil> Q: I want to set a timeout to a arr, such as var timeout["idTimeoutHere"]; How to use the #id of a element to name a arr key ? for example, something like var timeout["id" + $('element').attr('id') ] unfortunately doesnt work for me. Any tips ? or advice? thanks
[05:53:10] <seutje> Qdest: btw, you've probably seen it used like var foo = foo || {};
[05:53:26] <seutje> bascially means, if there's already a foo object, reference that, otherwise, make a fresh one
[05:53:57] <seutje> shwaiil: not entirely sure where ur getting at?
[05:54:17] <seutje> does it have anything to do with timeouts, or is that just an unfortunate name of the array?
[05:54:49] <shwaiil> seutje: tks for looking. just the name. the timeout is just to contextualise what im trying to achieve
[05:54:57] <seutje> also, u can't address specific array values with the var keyword
[05:55:04] <shwaiil> I need to key it, so I can kill the exact time out
[05:55:27] <seutje> var timeout = []; timeout[element.id] = 'foo'; should work, but you should probably be using an Object then
[05:55:27] <shwaiil> seutje: correct, sorry, just a typo for the "var" in the example
[05:55:50] <seutje> arrays are meant for numeric keys, things get confusing if u use arbitrary keys
[05:56:37] <Lucaszz> seutje: Thank you
[05:56:43] <shwaiil> seutje: so, var timeout = {}; timeout[el.id] = setTimout() ?
[05:56:53] <DarkArtist69> how can make a div background change when a radio button in another div is selected. I didnt think I could do it in just css. any ideas?
[05:56:55] <Lucaszz> I have one question also. Why it doesnt work with function names?
[05:57:23] <seutje> js> var el = document.createElement('div'), myObj = {}; el.id = 'lollercakes'; myObj[el.id] = 'lolapi'; print(myObj['lollercakes']);
[05:57:26] <b-ot> seutje: No output.
[05:57:31] <seutje> :(
[05:57:53] <shwaiil> seutje: worked fine, thanks for the tips!
[05:58:25] <seutje> yeah, works fine in a DOM where I actually have a document object :P
[05:59:19] <seutje> DarkArtist69: unfortunately, selecting a parent based on its children isn't possible in pure CSS right now
[05:59:47] <Trical> what is like the correct way to fill shit onload?
[05:59:58] <DarkArtist69> right, that is why I was asking here:) thought there may be a way with jquery. ..
[06:00:06] <PREFIX|> there is a way with jquery/javascript
[06:01:11] <fabioportieri> DarkArtist69: of course there is
[06:01:49] <newtothis> say, is theresomething like gensym for unique html id generation? or should i just run my own?
[06:01:56] <DarkArtist69> how :) or is there a link you can give me to check out things like it?
[06:02:34] <fabioportieri> if $('#yourCheck').is(':checked') { }
[06:02:38] <Fedzcek> jQuery v2.0 used with jQuery migrate plugin works in IE < 9?
[06:02:59] <Fedzcek> or i should use jquery v1.9?
[06:03:14] <DarkArtist69> cool, i will try that. thank you fabioportieri !!
[06:03:30] <PREFIX|> if $('#radioButton').is('checked') { $('divName').css({ background: "#AABBCC"}) }
[06:03:38] <PREFIX|> oh ":checked"
[06:04:28] <DarkArtist69> thank you as well :)
[06:04:46] <fabioportieri> noprob
[06:06:58] <_mak> any one have used the fineUploader? I've a question about it...
[06:07:55] <Fedzcek> does somebody know about my jquery v2.0 question?
[06:13:31] <Trical> $('#profile_info').append(response.name); -->this would work if profile_info was an id of something, how would I do this with a class?
[06:13:54] <fabioportieri> Trical: .profile_info
[06:17:42] <seutje> Fedzcek: doubt it
[06:18:53] <seutje> Fedzcek: jQuery migrate is for pin-pointing usage of deprecated/removed functionality or for converting to new API models
[06:19:43] <Fedzcek> so is better use something like jquery 1.8.3?
[06:20:41] <jo__> 'morning #jQuery.
[06:20:50] <Fedzcek> 'morning
[06:20:55] <seutje> Fedzcek: why not 1.9?
[06:22:06] <Germanaz0> hello folks. I'm getting a problem, I'm trying to resize an iframe, but the css detects that I'm accesing from a mobile device, and use the @media portrait code, I would love to avoid the media css with query, is that possible ?
[06:22:23] <Germanaz0> how to alter the media rules into jquery
[06:22:37] <Fedzcek> I didn't have opportunity to test it with old IEs
[06:22:40] <Fedzcek> works?
[06:23:52] <jo__> @Germanaz0 I think we had a similar problem a while back.  Let me ask our graphics designer what he did.
[06:24:04] <Germanaz0> thnx jo__ :D
[06:24:33] <seutje> Fedzcek: "jQuery 1.9 runs on Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 (‚ÄúoldIE‚Äù), just like previous versions. Consider it a cleaner, slimmer, modern-API upgrade from jQuery 1.8."
[06:24:40] <seutje> anything else I can quote straight from the docs?
[06:25:05] <Moult> i'm a bit spoilt for choice for lightbox scripts. could someone recomend me one to include a video insside?

[06:28:05] <seutje> interprets it as part of the query :(
[06:28:09] <Germanaz0> :s
[06:28:17] <Germanaz0> is there any way ?
[06:28:24] <Germanaz0> to change the sizes
[06:28:56] <Qdest> Germanaz0 ¬ª Take a look at the link provided by b-ot through seutje
[06:28:59] <Germanaz0> the other solution is to load another css, but is hard
[06:31:39] <Fedzcek> seutje: Ho perso quelle linee dal docs, ok grazie
[06:31:59] <Fedzcek> seutje: i've missed those lines from the docs, ok thanks
[06:32:02] <seutje> uhm... sure, I guess

[06:32:54] <Fedzcek> yes
[06:32:59] <Fedzcek> eheh
[06:33:19] <seutje> oh, mi scsi
[06:33:27] <Fedzcek> np
[06:34:07] <seutje> I always confuse portuguese, spanish and italian
[06:34:27] <seutje> it's all portitanish to me
[06:35:16] <jo__> Portalianish.
[06:35:37] <jo__> A portmanteau, oddly.
[06:36:02] <Fedzcek> ahaha
[06:36:14] <Germanaz0> :D
[06:36:31] <Germanaz0> seutje, it is easy to recognize those languages
[06:37:03] <Fedzcek> you're not alone don't worry

[06:37:50] <jo__> I can't tell the difference between Islandic, Norse, Finish, and most Nordic or Swedish languages.
[06:37:51] <introom> Hi. I set an element with .css("width", "20%")  now I wanna get the percentage value (20%). but it keeps giving me a px based value
[06:38:02] <introom> how can I get around this?
[06:38:25] <jo__> Does % need to be escaped?  I saw this problem once.
[06:39:42] <jo__> nvm
[06:40:51] <hufg> anyone know a kickass carousel that works with tablets, has swipe, is fast enough, works on orientation changes?
[06:41:09] <hufg> can't grind through hundreds of carousel plugins, already gone through two
[06:41:13] <Fedzcek> bxslider
[06:41:37] <Fedzcek> maybe with some well configured callbacks
[06:42:32] <seutje> introom: get .css('width') instead of width()?
[06:43:39] <introom> seutje:  I use $(item).siblings(":last").find(".meter").css("width")  and it returns px
[06:44:52] <introom> seutje: I set the child's width as 100%. Then I get the parent's width (px based) and the child's width(px based). but the value of child's width / parent's widht is 98%, not 100% .
[06:45:34] <Qdest> No idea, but did you try outerWidth?
[06:45:36] <hufg> Fedzcek: thanks
[06:46:45] <Fedzcek> ;)
[06:47:37] <ThiefMaster`> hi, is there a way to access a jquery ui widget's _off method from outside? i need to unbind the default click handler of a tab
[06:52:42] <seutje> introom: border/margin?
[06:53:04] <introom> seutje: yep. I guess it's because of these
[06:53:24] <introom> seutje: does jquery set the css attribute directly on the inline style tag?
[06:53:40] <seutje> introom: .css() uses the style attribute, yes
[06:53:44] <motka> I am the best jQuery developer in the inner Solar System!
[06:53:53] <introom> motka: haha
[06:54:32] <motka> yet, we do not know what creatures walk on Europa
[06:54:51] <bluepnume> Is there any way I can block an iframe from setting cookies, using javascript?
[06:55:10] <introom> seutje: $(selector)[0].style.width saved my life because I set percentage on that value
[06:55:33] <seutje> that was gonna be my "when all else fails"
[06:58:37] <Fedzcek> is $(selector)[0] faster than $(selector).get(0)?
[06:59:48] <motka> men walked on the moon?
[07:00:36] <pachet> Fedzcek: yes but if that's where you're optimizing i'd say it's 9 to 1 you have other things you should be considering
[07:01:23] <Fedzcek> I was just curious
[07:06:51] <motka> ima li srba ovdje?

[08:25:34] <Andrew_R> Trical: it's cleaner to put them in the HTML and update them with JS rather than put all your HTML code in the JS.
[08:26:57] <Andrew_R> it's not always possible though, for example if the HTML is dynamic and could be different (you could do hidden divs and show only the one you want though)

[09:31:46] <kzurawel> vsgill: what is the issue? you are hard-coding the box size....
[09:31:53] <hazardous> is there any simple table sorting/pagination thing? i'm on jq2.0
[09:31:58] <hazardous> datatables is a bit too overkill for my use case
[09:32:11] <vsgill> yes at first is the fixed size
[09:32:21] <vsgill> but now want to have different sizes div
[09:33:43] <kzurawel> you'll need to make your calculations a little more complicated. Get the current scrollTop when the user scrolls, and then calculate what box that puts the user inside of (add up the heights of each box one by one until you find it)
[09:34:05] <kzurawel> Will your divs change height as the user does stuff, or are they fixed?
[09:34:36] <vsgill> i can get the position of the divs on page load
[09:35:04] <kzurawel> Ok. If the heights never change, then probably best to put the height of each div into an array so you don't need to re-calculate them all the time
[09:35:19] <vsgill> i might need to incase the user add a new section
[09:36:03] <kzurawel> That's fine, as long as the existing sections don't change. That way you can just use a for loop to go through the array and compare the user's scroll position to the heights in the array (really the top of each section)
[09:36:39] <vsgill> right, i think i got what you mean, let me get back to coding and see if it works
[09:36:41] <kzurawel> vsgill: I don't have time right now to put up a fiddle or anything but hopefully that gives you an idea of where to start  :)
[09:36:43] <vsgill> thanks
[09:37:02] <vsgill> yes sometime you just need to talk to someone to get a bit of a push
[09:37:03] <vsgill> cheers
[09:52:37] <JonoB> Hi, I am getting an error "Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object Object] is not a function" as described in http://pastebin.com/H0AayWMd
[09:52:54] <JonoB> missing something obvious here, but can't spot it
[10:05:57] <BillCriswell> I keep typing 4 = instead of just 3.
[10:06:06] <BillCriswell> Pain in the ass. haha
[10:12:08] <jo__> Oh hey.  Is 2.0 out of beta now?
[10:12:52] <tw2113> yes
[10:17:07] <jo__> Sweet.
[10:20:17] <WillMarshall> Hey! I've got an issue in Jquery on this page: http://www.pyramind.com/training/
[10:20:19] <wilkinsmc> ur mom is out of beta
[10:20:21] <wilkinsmc> which is why i played her
[10:20:38] <WillMarshall> I'm getting a method call on nil, which is blocking execution of most of the JS plugins. Issue arose after a Wordpress update
[10:21:04] <WillMarshall> What I can't figure out is how to trace that exception back and work out what actually *called* JQuery
[10:21:46] <mehwork> if you need to do a lot of javascript/css customization, and loading of external files, is jQuery Mobile not a good choice?
[10:42:20] <lukejt> is there any obvious reason why "$('#newAccForm')[0].reset();" works (at resetting a form) from a .press() calback, but is ignored in a .keydown() callback?
[10:43:18] <NoiseEee> lukejt: no, other than that by the time you've keyed-up, its obvioulsy not empty/reset any more
[10:43:26] <NoiseEee> ie: the new letter is there
[10:47:40] <lukejt> NoiseEee: I'm pressing the [esc] key so it doesn't add anything to the focused input. Thanks anyway though
[10:53:54] <AusME> I'm very new to JS and I'm not even entirely certain what vocabulary to use in Google to do what I'm asking, so forgive the simple question, but how do I *start* or activate this JQuery function?
[10:53:54] <AusME> $.soap({...
[10:56:39] <Orginator> has anyone in here maybe used JqTree ? I am creating a tree, then sometime later it needs to be recreated.. how can I completly destory/remove the current ont?
[10:59:24] <ctienrsg> how can get the selected value in an option with jquery?
[10:59:56] <sacho> in an option?
[11:00:07] <sacho> $().val() for the select.
[11:00:46] <ctienrsg> sacho: second, I try
[11:01:03] <Raydiation> hi ive got a .list-title:hover style in my css but $('.list-title').trigger('hover') doesnt show it
[11:01:11] <Raydiation> when i hover over it normally it works though
[11:02:21] <motka> propaganda
[11:02:35] <kzurawel> Raydiation: 'hover' isn't an event; it's a shortcut to mouseover / mouseout
[11:02:49] <kzurawel> what does your hover do?
[11:03:02] <sacho> Raydiation, you probably want to trigger mouseenter.
[11:03:42] <Raydiation> doesnt it work because i use the chrome console?
[11:04:07] <sacho> huh?
[11:04:24] <Raydiation> that it does not show
[11:04:35] <Raydiation> when i force :hover on the element in the tools it works
[11:04:45] <Raydiation> but executing the script doesnt
[11:04:55] <sacho> Because .trigger('hover') doesn't force a hover.
[11:05:02] <sacho> <kzurawel> Raydiation: 'hover' isn't an event; it's a shortcut to mouseover / mouseout
[11:05:27] <Raydiation> sacho: doesnt work either
[11:05:35] <Raydiation> mouseenter, mouseover, neither works
[11:05:37] <sacho> please provide a test case.
[11:06:07] <NoiseEee> why bother triggering 'hover'?  why not just .addClass('sameThingAsHoverDoes') ?
[11:06:17] <NoiseEee> trigger() is for lame-os
[11:06:55] <wilkinsmc> haha
[11:07:55] <Raydiation> here you go http://jsfiddle.net/vgPBD/
[11:08:16] <Raydiation> NoiseEee: acceptance tests
[11:09:09] <Raydiation> with cucumber + capybara
[11:09:13] <Raydiation> + selenium
[11:09:49] <Raydiation> ah, damn no jquery sec
[11:10:11] <Raydiation> http://jsfiddle.net/vgPBD/1/
[11:10:46] <NoiseEee> Raydiation: compare with http://jsfiddle.net/vgPBD/2/
[11:12:04] <Raydiation> NoiseEee: weird
[11:12:22] <Raydiation> so it triggers mouseover and immediately mouseout?
[11:12:34] <NoiseEee> well not really; events firing really doesn't have anything to do with CSS (afaik)
[11:12:53] <NoiseEee> its calling the function i defined as the 'mouseover' function
[11:12:59] <Phoenixz> I am checking a jquery mobile site I did, one page does not want to scroll to the bottom. it scrolls the header of the page just out of view and then stops, while there is some 40% of the page left. Is this a known problem?
[11:13:06] <sacho> Raydiation, you're probably going to have to add a class to add/remove to simulate the hover, then
[11:13:12] <NoiseEee> ^^
[11:13:45] <Raydiation> dman
[11:13:54] <Raydiation> just when i though jquery was useful :D
[11:16:28] <sacho> jquery is limited to what javascript can do.
[11:17:45] <ctienrsg> sacho: doesnt work so far, but the bug is me. here is a fiddle, maybe someone tell me how i get the value: http://jsfiddle.net/q5Teq/
[11:18:36] <sacho> ctienrsg, what's the id of the select?
[11:19:08] <ctienrsg> sacho: here is updated version, sorry :/
[11:19:16] <ctienrsg> http://jsfiddle.net/q5Teq/1/
[11:20:56] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/q5Teq/2/
[11:21:08] <sacho> don't forget to load jquery, and actually display the value somehow.
[11:22:36] <ctienrsg> thanks, sacho. Sorry for the very noobish question, but I realized that codeschool and tryjquery tutorials don't help me as much as i once thought‚Ä¶
[11:24:36] <scrupul0us> can any recommend a lamens guide to drag and drop? i would like to present my user with a library of say 4 shapes, and I'd like them to be able to drag and drop them into a grid layout... theres a some additional functionality id like to add but if I can see some working examples I'm confident I can probably push through most if it... thank you
[11:25:33] <PREFIX|> http://www.elated.com/articles/drag-and-drop-with-jquery-your-essential-guide/
[11:25:46] <PREFIX|> took me a whole 3 seconds to google
[11:26:05] <PREFIX|> http://www.ericbieller.com/2010/06/24/how-to-create-a-simple-drag-and-drop-with-jquery/
[11:26:09] <PREFIX|> http://viralpatel.net/blogs/implement-drag-and-drop-example-jquery-javascript-html/
[11:26:41] <scrupul0us> i appreciate the assistance... most of what i found (perhaps by searching too granularly) was more of the backend than workable frontend examples
[11:28:30] <scrupul0us> that first link, with the number cards game is perfect, its essentially the layout/format im going for... thank you again, i appreciate your time
[11:28:47] <lukejt> so it seems that if you reset a form with .reset(), any focused input is left alone. has anyone else encountered that?
[11:31:10] <PREFIX|> no problem =)
[11:33:31] <scrupul0us> and the second link has easy to understand step-by-step to make it understandable... =)

[11:49:41] <ricomoss> I'm new to jquery.  I've created a modal window that will post (with an onclick event) and I need to force the modal window closed after the post.  Can anyone tell me how I would do this?
[11:53:18] <ricomoss> It seems I was doing it correctly ($.modal.close()) but our project is using some other stuff someone built out so I needed to make a special call due to the type of modal I was using.
[12:04:09] <diverdude> Hey, can anybody playback this video=? http://jsfiddle.net/pJkeu/
[12:05:08] <vladikoff> diverdude, yes works in Chrome Beta
[12:06:02] <NoiseEee> and regular chrome, and opera and FF.

[12:14:27] <mike_papa> Hey guys. I need a hand with selector. I have a <tr> element with multiple <td>s. One of <td> contains <input type="button">. Now I need a selector for whole <tr> excluding <input> and for <input> to perform different action.
[12:15:59] <madprops> I want to implement a tab bar like firefox's where the tabs move left to right instead of shrinking. is there a solution for this already?
[12:25:56] <BillCriswell> mike_papa: Need to run that by me again.
[12:26:57] <BillCriswell> madprops: overflow scroll?
[12:28:49] <madprops> yeah I'm looking into it
[12:29:57] <mike_papa> BillCriswell: I do have table row with 4 table cells. One cell has a button. Now I want .click on button do a different thing then .click on rest of the row. So I need selector that will get whole row but input element, and other selector that will get only input. $("tr").click() runs on whatever I click in the row including button. I need to exclude it somehow.
[12:31:15] <BillCriswell> so you want to click on a button in a <tr> and not have it button up to the <tr>?
[12:31:45] <BillCriswell> not have it bubble up*
[12:32:35] <NoiseEee> mike_papa: $('tr').on('click',function(e) { var element = $(e.target);  if(element.hasClass('somethingICareAbout')) { //do something } else { //do something else} });
[12:32:55] <NoiseEee> mike_papa: in other words, you don't cancel the bubble - you inspect the element clicked, and decide whether or not to do anything about it.
[12:33:53] <BillCriswell> Glad you could decipher that. I was struggling a bit.
[12:34:18] <NoiseEee> beauty teamwork
[12:34:26] <nicetry> Wierd question - is there an api for using the jquery docs http://api.jquery.com ?
[12:35:21] <BillCriswell> Javascript Five!
[12:36:14] <mike_papa> Here is quick fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/54HEp/ - I need button to do only button action, not both row and button.
[12:36:31] <sacho> nicetry, I don't think so, but I think bots are using the html structure to scrape name/description/return value/params
[12:36:33] <mike_papa> NoiseEee: will your answer do the thing?
[12:36:33] <NoiseEee> mike_papa: please read why I typed.
[12:36:46] <nicetry> sacho: Interesting.
[12:36:51] <vladikoff> nicetry, this might help you https://github.com/jqapi/jqapi#generate-the-documentation
[12:37:45] <BillCriswell> mike_papa: I'd definitely read NoiseEee's suggestion, but for what you're trying to do here you want this: http://jsfiddle.net/54HEp/1/
[12:38:02] <nicetry> sacho and vladikoff - interesting.   I was jsut thinking about how cool it would be to write a simple little firebug consol equivalent to the unix 'man' for things like jquery or javascript in general.
[12:38:41] <mike_papa> BillCriswell: stopPropagation - something new for me. Thanks.
[12:38:55] <nicetry> right in the consol just write man width()
[12:39:08] <nicetry> and get back the relevant info from http://api.jquery.com/width/
[12:39:11] <NoiseEee> mike_papa: or http://jsfiddle.net/54HEp/2/
[12:39:42] <mike_papa> NoiseEee: and that looks even better :)
[12:39:45] <mike_papa> Thanks guys.
[12:40:10] <NoiseEee> np good lucjk
[12:40:13] <NoiseEee> er luck
[12:40:22] <BillCriswell> You could even do $('tr').on('click', 'button.edit', function(){ /* You clicked the edit button */ });
[12:40:24] <sacho> nicetry, I agree.
[12:41:02] <nicetry> that link vladikoff just sent looks promising, might be to difficult to riff off of that
[12:41:39] <nicetry> Am I too lazy when I've decided I don't want to have to reach over to my mouse and navigate to http://api.jquery.com/ to look something up?
[12:42:26] <BillCriswell> nicetry: Command + Tab to Chrome, Command + L to focus Omnibar Thingie, Type, Hit Enter =)
[12:42:37] <nicetry> BillCriswell: HA!
[12:43:26] <nicetry> BillCriswell: I still just want just the last two things you wrote there
[12:43:32] <nicetry> type + hit enter
[12:44:40] <BillCriswell> Just learned in the terminal I can type: open http://www.google.com
[12:44:47] <BillCriswell> Didn't expect that to work.
[12:45:09] <nicetry> I did the same thing with "replace"
[12:45:26] <nicetry> <3 unix
[12:46:21] <BillCriswell> I don't understand that sorcery. One day.
[12:48:05] <nicetry> BillCriswell:  tail -f /var/log/mylog.log | replace '/my/really/long/path/that/is/always/there/in/the/log/entry/'  ''
[12:48:49] <BillCriswell> that doesn't seem very fun to type.
[12:48:49] <nicetry> so simple, and so much better now that each log fits on its own line without wrapping around
[12:49:03] <nicetry> you only have to type it once, if you use an alias
[12:49:30] <nicetry> alias tailr="tail -f /var/log/mylog.log | replace '/my/really/long/path/that/is/always/there/in/the/log/entry/'  ''
[12:50:11] <BillCriswell> Doesn't seem like it's for me haha
[12:50:46] <BillCriswell> maybe one day if i ever get the urge to learn it
[13:02:24] <bowenac> Im having an issue with animate on hover in chrome and ie where the animate only works once. In firefox it works fine.
[13:02:41] <bowenac> I made a jsfiddle using the same code the site is if anyone would like to take a look...
[13:03:24] <bowenac> seems to work fine in the jsfiddle though, but on the wordpress site its not working correctly in chrome or ie, I have to reload the page or any page then the menu animate will work again but only once.

[13:09:55] <raj> hola shoky
[13:10:45] <raj> ok, one sec
[13:11:22] <BillCriswell> shoky: Where's the naked Indian?
[13:12:22] <BillCriswell> Now I need to watch it.
[13:12:24] * shoky points at raj
[13:12:56] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[13:13:32] <raj> i've got undies on

[13:16:38] <alibama> hey folks - I'm trying to get http://pastebin.com/TrN3zKbD to work on each image, however my script works on the first and then repeats on the rest‚Ä¶ anyone mind lending me a hand using "each" correctly
[13:17:07] <alibama> basically i'm trying to print the image title attribute above the image
[13:17:22] <alibama> it works fine on the first one, however subsequent images break
[13:17:58] <alibama> http://exhibits.hsl.virginia.edu/lewisclark/natives/
[13:18:36] <alibama> although anyone looking at this may notice the irony of lewis and clark meeting with the indians vs meeting them (with guns...)
[13:19:31] <madprops> is there a way to calculate a div's overflow-x when overflow-x is hidden?
[13:19:33] <BillCriswell> You'd have to $.each through them or maybe use before() with an anonymous function.
[13:19:37] <BillCriswell> alibama: ^
[13:20:24] <alibama> BillCriswell: thank you - so where would i put the anonymous function?
[13:20:42] <alibama> would it be before  $j('.size-full').before(title);
[13:21:04] <alibama> ie .each(function(){ $j('.size-full').before(title); }
[13:21:30] <alibama> i've been guessing around for an hour or so‚Ä¶
[13:21:35] <BillCriswell> alibama: Don't need the each really: http://jsbin.com/umixof/1/edit
[13:22:27] <alibama> BillCriswell Thank you :)
[13:22:37] <BillCriswell> alibama: No problem!
[13:23:13] <aaas> newbie ?: im trying to understand this simple code: http://jsfiddle.net/CzkBu/60/    I undertand that el and ev in the first line are element and event arguments, but where do they come from? can someone just explain this a little bit
[13:25:39] <BillCriswell> aaas: They come from jQuery ( if I'm understanding your question right ).
[13:25:45] <shoky> aaas: that's pretty weird code
[13:26:50] <jo__> God I hate UI development.
[13:27:21] <BillCriswell> aaas: el is actually the event object, ev is undefined ( in the bind part of it )
[13:27:48] <jo__> Why can't the world just use the commend line?  :P
[13:27:50] <aaas> so it looks like they are necessary, it's just nievely i would think, 'ok ill add arguments to pass if I need to use them' but i guess since i need to grab the event there's no way to do except for this way
[13:28:02] <aaas> sorry the question probably sounds stupid...just not used to this jquery stuff
[13:28:02] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/CzkBu/62/ @ aaas
[13:28:35] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/CzkBu/63/ sorry aaas, didnt realize you were using 1.6.x
[13:28:53] <GaryOak_> jo__: You should be glad you are using jquery, and not something like Java Swing
[13:29:34] <jo__> We're using jQuery on our main site.  I'm doing our mobile app now.  It's...
[13:30:11] <aaas> NoiseEee so what im trying to do is get only one click and block all others until animation completes, will your code do that
[13:30:14] <kba> I'm having a hard time navigating the DOM tree with jQuery. For instance, I'm trying to find a specific children of an element, and so far I'm doing console.log($(this).closest('.tab-pane').children());
[13:30:28] <kba> But I'm having a hard time understanding where I am or, well, what the exact children are here.
[13:30:39] <NoiseEee> aaas: nope
[13:30:43] <kba> How do you guys usually orientate yourself about your whereabouts in the source code?
[13:30:50] <BillCriswell> kba: .closest('.tab-pane') would go to the closest parent .tab-pane
[13:30:58] <jo__> kba: You can specify children with $(".foo > .blah")
[13:31:13] <BillCriswell> .children() would return all immediate children of that, not grand children or anything.
[13:31:25] <kba> In the .closest clause?
[13:31:34] <shoky> no
[13:31:35] <jo__> No.
[13:31:37] <kba> Yes, yes, I get that. I just can't get it to work.
[13:31:42] <aaas> NoiseEee so this is the one before i modified to try and understand things: http://jsfiddle.net/oceog/CzkBu/
[13:31:56] <jo__> If you select the parent $("#parentIdentifier").children(), that should get the children as a list.
[13:32:12] <kba> jo__: Is there a neat way to present that list in the console easily?
[13:32:12] <aaas> youll nottice that it does what i want...i just need to do this with chained animations which is why im trying to understand it
[13:32:22] <jo__> kba: what browser are you using?
[13:32:24] <kba> jo__: Chrome
[13:32:40] <jo__> Firefox and Chrome should dump an object [<blah blah>  <blah blah> <blah blah>]
[13:32:48] <kba> That's... actually what I thought.
[13:32:54] <kba> Then I just don't understand what's going on here.
[13:32:56] <NoiseEee> aaas: my code does the same thing as that, but cleaner.
[13:33:00] <jo__> If you can't use that, consider assigning it to an object.
[13:33:07] <jo__> var foo = (the selector above);
[13:33:13] <jo__> Then iterate through foo with square brackets.
[13:33:18] <NoiseEee> aaas: how does your example do what you want? I can animate both at once
[13:33:22] <jo__> foo[0] = <some object descriptor>
[13:33:30] <jo__> Easier to check the objects one-by-one.
[13:33:36] <aaas> NoiseEee yes but keep clicking it over and over, the annimations dont stack
[13:33:41] <jo__> That will give a nice format and output on a per-object basis.
[13:33:53] <NoiseEee> aaas: nor does mine?  what is your issue exactly?
[13:34:06] <kba> jo__: Could you have a look at these few lines: http://paste.debian.net/2754/. I feel like I've tried a lot to remove the 'hidden' class of the 2nd div when I'm in the context of the button .copyScheduleButton.
[13:34:29] <kba> When I from that context do $(this).closest('.tab-pane').children(), I don't get a list as I would have hoped
[13:34:45] <aaas> NoiseEee so what im trying to do is get only one click and block all others until animation completes, so your code *WILL* do that?
[13:34:55] <shoky> kba: what ARE you getting?
[13:35:01] <NoiseEee> aaas: i give up, does it?!?!?!  did you try it?!?!!??!?!
[13:35:11] <jo__> Which element are you trying to select?
[13:35:14] <BillCriswell> kba: That would return . addMovie and .copySchedule and .container-fluid, the immediate children.
[13:35:25] <aaas> NoiseEee your code has ***1*** animation, there is no queuing with 1
[13:35:33] <aaas> which is why i resent the bigger code
[13:35:38] <kba> BillCriswell: It doesn't. Or I don't know how to access it.
[13:36:23] <kba> what I get in the console is http://paste.debian.net/2756/
[13:36:23] <BillCriswell> Not sure how to access what? Those elements?
[13:36:53] <kba> I'd think I could just do $(this).closest('.tab-pane').children('.addMvoie').removeClass('hidden')
[13:36:59] <kba> but that does nothing.
[13:37:06] <shoky> kba:  might wanna try  console.log( $(this).closest('.tab-pane').children().get() )
[13:37:32] <shoky> (or .length)
[13:37:33] <kba> shoky: Returns [].
[13:37:38] <shoky> ah
[13:38:09] <BillCriswell> kba: HTML valid?
[13:38:16] <kba> But it's clearly there, the elements are clearly there. It's not some DOM elemnets I'm generating, they're right there in the code
[13:38:22] <NoiseEee> aaas: the code you provided has a lot of useless stuff in it.  i was just cleaning it. http://jsfiddle.net/CzkBu/64/
[13:38:32] <shoky> kba: break it down.  first step: console.log( this )
[13:38:33] <NoiseEee> aaas: maybe your next fiddle should include some chained animations?
[13:39:23] <BillCriswell> kba: Also, type for addMvoie there... never sure if it's actually in the code like that or not haha
[13:39:33] <aaas> NoiseEee ok i modified your code with my longer code which has the repeating animations http://jsfiddle.net/oceog/CzkBu/  it does work thanks...yes i will look into the channing thanks
[13:39:46] <aaas> oops: http://jsfiddle.net/CzkBu/65/
[13:39:56] <s3b`> Hey I have an object that has a jquery element in it, and onDrag I want to update the object's variables: http://hastebin.com/fesojorafu.js
[13:41:28] <BillCriswell> kba: http://jsbin.com/usawix/1/edit
[13:41:31] <jo__> kba: I don't know if it will interfere with your selectors, but one of the inputs is not closed.
[13:41:53] <kba> BillCriswell: Not fixed a few minor errors, now it's valid HTML5. Same output as before.
[13:42:04] <BillCriswell> This is returning 1. It must be something else going on in your code.
[13:42:21] <jo__> It's making the div mismatch.
[13:42:42] <jo__> movieDuration doesn't have a closed tag, so it's matching with the div on the indentation-level below.
[13:43:48] <kba> jo__: What? movieDuration is an input. It's self-closing and the self-closing backslach is optional in HTML5
[13:43:59] <BillCriswell> kba: See the link I sent?
[13:44:14] <kba> BillCriswell: Yes, I see it
[13:44:35] <BillCriswell> Ok cool, it's retuning 1 like it should. I think there's something else going on in your code.
[13:44:53] <kba> Yeah
[13:45:11] <shoky> kba: break it down.... console.log( this, $(this).closest('.tab-pane').get() )
[13:45:23] <kba> Oh...
[13:45:43] <kba> Stupid me. Stupid. Mystery solved.
[13:45:53] <kba> I'm calling $(this).closest('.copySchedule').remove(); on the line above.
[13:46:00] <kba> I'll just move that... down here.
[13:46:48] <kba> Aaaand it works.
[13:47:06] <kba> Thanks for the helhelp. Well, at least I got my code cleaned up a bit and now it validates.
[13:47:13] <shoky> great job
[13:49:10] <BillCriswell> kba: Good times.
[13:49:47] <BillCriswell> I've been trying to put a link on a site for the past 2 hours.
[13:49:57] <BillCriswell> Just so boring I can't stand to do it.
[13:50:02] <BillCriswell> I'm a terrible employee.
[13:50:03] <kba> ;-)
[13:50:52] <BillCriswell> Switched recently from TextMate to sublime text... loving this shit.
[13:52:17] <sacho> It's very sublime.
[13:52:26] <kba> hell yeah
[13:52:57] <kba> Crazy awesome. select something, cmd+d and mass-edit is so awesome.
[13:53:16] <kba> same with cmd+l and alt+cmd+vertical mouse select
[13:53:34] <BillCriswell> mass edit == find and replace?
[13:54:04] <abes> Question: how can one disable vertical scroll/swipe past given element? I have a DIV that is an overlay with some information and I want the page not to scroll past its end - then, when I hide the overlay the page should be back "to normal". Doable?
[13:55:07] <awc737> is this valid array/object/whatever it is? http://paste.laravel.com/qMj
[13:55:07] <GaryOak_> BillCriswell: It's more dynamic than that
[13:55:39] <kba> BillCriswell: Sort of, yes. But like you edit many lines at one. It's not just a find/replace
[13:55:56] <kba> BillCriswell: well, just try out cmd+d if you don't already use it.
[13:56:05] <jo__> awc737: Looks valid.
[13:56:07] <GaryOak_> BillCriswell: think multiple cursors
[13:56:14] <awc737> thanks jo__
[13:56:18] <awc737> is it an object of arrays?
[13:56:35] <jo__> It's an object.
[13:56:40] <jo__> An object full of objects.
[13:56:40] <kba> BillCriswell: it's actually the feature being demonstrated on the front page of http://www.sublimetext.com/
[13:56:45] <elgringoguapo> can someone give me a hint on what library... or perhaps something close to this library that will give me this effect:  http://www.kdweb.co.uk/blog/drupal-module-views-hook-sequence
[13:56:52] <awc737> thanks jo
[13:56:55] <jo__> Caveat: linkUrl must be defined.
[13:57:00] <jo__> If it's not, then you'll get an error
[13:57:20] <sacho> abes, one way would be to stop all scrolling methods.
[13:57:27] <sacho> abes, another would be to temporarily remove your scrollbars.
[13:57:34] <jo__> Also, awc737, if you're making JSON out of that, you'll need to use double quotes.
[13:57:59] <jo__> And, again, make sure linkUrl is defined.
[13:58:40] <BillCriswell> kba: Ah, a more... visual search and replace.
[13:59:58] <kba> BillCriswell: it allows for much more than just search replace. E.g. if you want to move an attr for instance, say you select 5 objects with 5 different classes, you can just select the 5 different classes all at once and make them 5 different IDs aswell.
[14:00:18] <kba> BillCriswell: It allows you to have an individual "pastebin" for each cursor/line
[14:00:57] <kba> also, if you select 5 lines with a,b,c,d,e, each letter on each line, and you make a cmd+d select on 5 items and you paste, a will go in the first selection, b in the second and so forth
[14:02:37] <BillCriswell> Not following that one? Always search and replaced when I needed to do something similar.
[14:02:46] <BillCriswell> At least I think haha
[14:03:59] <kba> BillCriswell: http://paste.debian.net/2760/ Copy that into a new document.
[14:04:08] <kba> BillCriswell: Now select the 5 first lines and copy them into your pastebin.
[14:04:31] <kba> BillCriswell: Now, select the first X. Press cmd until all 5 X's are selected. Now paste.
[14:05:17] <BillCriswell> I get you now.
[14:06:31] <kba> BillCriswell: Now, you can select class, cmd+d until you selected all 5. Then press right arrow twice, and copy the letter. Now you got a,b,c,d,e, in your pastebin on 5 lines again. So now you can go back, cmd+a alt+right a+right and write id=" then paste and then "
[14:06:47] <kba> That's the brilliant part of it.
[14:08:01] <BillCriswell> Yeah that is cool, luckily I don't have to do that too often though.
[14:08:22] <kba> Question: I use $('.removeMovieIcon').click(function (e) ..., but suddenly that isn't fired on some new elements I just created that match '.removeMovieIcon'.
[14:08:34] <kba> I thought I should just use: $('.removeMovieIcon').on('click',function (e) { ..., but no dice.
[14:08:43] <kba> BillCriswell: Oh well, I use that a lot. :)
[14:08:46] <BillCriswell> kba: Would need to use event delegation.
[14:09:11] <BillCriswell> $('.someContainerThatDoesntAlter').on('click', '.removeMovieIcon', function(e){ });
[14:09:29] <kba> so the container could just be like... my body?
[14:09:39] <BillCriswell> kba: You can use your body all you want.
[14:09:45] <kba> but it'll be slow I guess
[14:09:56] <kba> oh, wait, I get it. Herp derp.
[14:10:36] <BillCriswell> kba: It doesn't HAVE to be body, but if you're manipulating a bunch of <li>s the <ul> probably isn't changing so you can do $('ul').on('click', 'li', foo);
[14:11:19] <kba> Hm, $('.removeMovieIcon').on('click','body', function (e) { does nothing.
[14:11:23] <kba> That just breaks it.
[14:11:25] <BillCriswell> Wrong way.
[14:11:45] <kba> How so? The parameter order is right according to http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[14:11:46] <BillCriswell> $('.parent').on('click', '.child', foo);
[14:12:01] <kba> oh...
[14:12:03] <kba> Right
[14:12:32] <BillCriswell> I'm not seeing the way you provided as being right according to this either. =p
[14:12:41] <BillCriswell> Plus, you should be looking at .on
[14:12:53] <kba> ;-)
[14:12:59] <kba> It's the same example.
[14:13:01] <PREFIX|> wait
[14:13:08] <kba> But now I got: $('body').on('click','.removeMovieIcon', function (e) {
[14:13:25] <PREFIX|> that just sends .removeMovieIcon as a data parameter to mouse event doesn it?
[14:13:26] <kba> BillCriswell: It works on my old elements (again now), but still not on the new ones.
[14:13:45] <kba> PREFIX|: eh, no, not according to doc
[14:13:52] <BillCriswell> kba: Sure it's not something else in your code?
[14:14:05] <kba> It tend to be, don't it :(
[14:14:09] <BillCriswell> PREFIX|: If that parameter was an object it would I believe.
[14:14:30] <PREFIX|> ah ok
[14:14:37] <PREFIX|> because that's what it did for me with an obj
[14:14:46] <PREFIX|> my fault for using .on and fucking around without reading documentation
[14:14:53] <PREFIX|> knowing I can use a selector there is even better =D
[14:15:14] <kba> BillCriswell: oh, nvm, it works now. I must have... Uhm... Forgotten to cmd+s or some shit. Thanks again. God, I'm useles.
[14:15:28] <BillCriswell> kba: haha, happens.
[14:15:52] <BillCriswell> PREFIX|: Beats checking the event.target in the code.
[14:16:09] <PREFIX|> ye
[14:16:13] <PREFIX|> i had some issues with that last night
[14:16:28] <PREFIX|> I set mouseenter on a DIV, and target would show subdivs, that fucked me over
[14:16:35] <PREFIX|> it does not make sense that currentTarget is the source
[14:16:44] <PREFIX|> or maybe it does for everyone else, but for me that  makes no sense
[14:17:01] <sacho> PREFIX|, but it's not.
[14:17:03] <BillCriswell> People have put way more thought into it than me so I'm sure it's for a good reason haha
[14:17:38] <sacho> PREFIX|, currentTarget is the element on which the current handler was applied.
[14:17:45] <PREFIX|> that's what I said
[14:17:47] <PREFIX|> source
[14:17:49] <PREFIX|> or what I meant
[14:17:59] <sacho> The source is event.target :)
[14:18:15] <PREFIX|> hmm
[14:18:25] <PREFIX|> are you saying a .on mouseenter will trigger on all descendants?
[14:18:49] <BillCriswell> PREFIX|: Absolutely.
[14:18:51] <sacho> If you leave out the selector, yes.
[14:18:54] <sacho> That's how bubbling works.
[14:19:43] <PREFIX|> that explains a lot of my headache
[14:20:01] <BillCriswell> I saw $('div').on('submit', foo) with a form inside it. I didn't expect the div to fire a submit event, but it does.
[14:20:16] <BillCriswell> when the form inside of it was submitted.
[14:21:36] <PREFIX|> what is the selector for only the element the handler is applied? just use :first?
[14:21:56] <kzurawel> PREFIX|: inside your handler, use $(this)
[14:23:09] <PREFIX|> im confused
[14:23:13] <abes> sacho: the problem is, on iphone the overlay div extends past the screen, so I need to be able to scroll till the end of that div - I tried preventing default for touchmove, which works great on Android with a bigger screen but on iPhone it just cuts off the overlay and I can't see the rest of it.
[14:23:55] <sacho> abes, so prevent it conditionally :)
[14:24:28] <sacho> you can get how much you have scrolled so far
[14:24:39] <abes> sacho: that's what I am trying to achieve - I want to detect when the bottom of the screen and the end of the div "align" the further scroll is disabled
[14:24:40] <sacho> and I assume you can somehow determine the offset of this div
[14:25:45] <sacho> abes, window.innerHeight, div.offset, scroll?
[14:25:47] <nFFF> Any animation experts here?
[14:26:02] <nFFF> IS it possible to create animations without flash http://www.loropiana.com/flash.html#/lang:en like that
[14:26:16] <PREFIX|> Im doing jQueryObj.on('mouseenter', showInfo) and then in showInfo(event) using event.currentTarget since jQueryObj is a "div" with several child divs, guess that's not the prettiest way to do it
[14:27:10] <BillCriswell> PREFIX|: You can access this in there
[14:28:44] <PREFIX|> indeed
[14:29:01] <PREFIX|> ty!
[14:29:06] <BillCriswell> Welcome
[14:41:56] <rindolf> Hi all.
[14:42:11] <lukejt> hi
[14:42:28] <vladikoff> hello
[14:44:52] <lukejt> quit
[14:44:57] <lukejt> oops
[14:45:07] <rindolf> vladikoff: what's up?
[14:53:15] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of a plugin that show percentage of form completed with meter bar?
[14:54:29] <Pasq89> anyone with bootstrap experience?
[14:54:46] <s5fs> Forbidd3n: jquery ui progressbar?
[14:55:03] <Pasq89> i face a weird issue!
[14:55:22] <s5fs> Pasq89: state your issue, someone may have seen it before
[14:55:47] <Forbidd3n> s5fs: it doesn't show % does it, let me check thanks
[14:56:00] <w00tner> hello
[14:56:47] <Pasq89> i have a collapsable layout. when the screen becames small enough(like a smartphone), the div collapses, but a horizontal bar appears with a little whitespace on the right-most of the page.
[14:56:54] <Forbidd3n> s5fs: basically looking for form completion progress
[14:56:57] <s5fs> Forbidd3n: I believe you have to specify the percentage to "fill up" the bar, it doesn't show "X% Complete"
[14:56:59] <w00tner> i have an ul with 20 li with the id=lugar .. i want to run a function when clicked the <a> tag inside the list...im trying: $('#lugar a').on('click', alert("hola");)   no success
[14:57:12] <Pasq89> i try inspecting elements on chrome... but nothing seems to be that white space... even body doesnt include it!
[14:58:21] <Andrew_R> w00tner: do all your li's have the same id?
[14:59:01] <w00tner> yes
[14:59:02] <w00tner> wrong?
[14:59:16] <w00tner> i have a div called #places also where the ul is nested
[14:59:16] <Andrew_R> that's not valid, all id's on a page have to be unique
[14:59:21] <w00tner> thanks
[14:59:24] <w00tner> got it
[15:00:05] <s5fs> Forbidd3n: in the past I've just counted up the # of form fields, then onblur would re-calculate how many were filled in and then update the progressbar accordingly.
[15:02:46] <Pasq89> anybody read my story?
[15:03:03] <Forbidd3n> s5fs: ok that is what I will do, thanks
[15:03:08] <w00tner> this i my unordered list: http://pastie.org/7815489#12
[15:03:20] <w00tner> part of it
[15:03:35] <Forbidd3n> I can't seem to find in the docs how to validate with jquery validation plugin radio buttons or checkboxes
[15:03:38] <w00tner> so is ul id=lugares im trying: $("#places a").on("click", clickLugar);
[15:03:50] <w00tner> nothign happens not even error
[15:03:54] <s5fs> Pasq89: I did, but I don't have anything to add, sorry.
[15:08:55] <fdv> Hi, folks. I've been making a widget (using jquery ui's widget factory), and I've had to expose quite a few more methods than I'd really like to unit test it. a couple of approaches that might help would be either to make the methods in question "private" (by prepending '-' to them), or by extracting the same methods into one or more helper objects. Prepending '_', however, doesn't work, as then I'm prevented from calling them, and creating a helper ...
[15:09:01] <fdv> ... object would clutter the global name space. Does anybody have any ideas / tips?
[15:09:10] <w00tner> hey how can i get the <a href="#" title="San Carlos" data-latlng="15.0002,-14.1511" value="0">
[15:09:15] <w00tner> data-latlng  field??
[15:09:24] <w00tner> $(this). ???
[15:09:41] <fdv> .data('latlng')?
[15:09:42] <Pasq89> thanks s5fs ... i think i found out where it comes from..
[15:10:16] <Pasq89> the page loads okay, then ajax staff get into page, and vertical scroll appears. That vertical scroll, adds somehow that space! :/
[15:14:28] <Pasq89> s5fs: do you have a good memory?
[15:15:29] <PREFIX|> if you have div FOO and inside that you have div BAR. Am I right to say $('#FOO').children(":first") is not the same in functionality/object as $('#BAR') ?
[15:22:02] <lasha> hi guys
[15:22:06] <s5fs> hi
[15:22:13] <s5fs> Pasq89: haha, sure, I guess I have a good memory :)
[15:22:15] <JosephSilber> PREFIX|, but $('#BAR') is *so mush* more efficient
[15:22:18] <lasha> so, i'm a developer ‚Äì frontend.
[15:22:27] <lasha> i'm thinking about changing careers.
[15:22:36] <lasha> i don't really wanna do computers anymore.
[15:22:45] <lasha> suggestions?
[15:22:53] <s5fs> lasha: sure
[15:22:57] <sacho> yeah, they're terrible and never tip.
[15:23:15] <Pasq89> s5fs: okay! :) tell the next guy who faces my problem on isotope, not to override body's padding!  just leave it to bootstrap css!
[15:23:22] <PREFIX|> thing is JosephSilber, I need to grab the first child element of a DIV i have a handler on and treat it like if it was a $(this) or rather $('childelementid')
[15:23:25] <s5fs> lasha: aside from computers, the only other thing I'd like to be is a timber framer.
[15:23:34] <s5fs> Pasq89: haha, will do!
[15:23:50] <s5fs> Pasq89: glad you got it working, nice job!
[15:24:05] <JosephSilber> PREFIX|, just use the handler: $handler.find('#BAR');
[15:26:43] <PREFIX|> JosephSilber.... can't do that when I don't know the ID of the sub div as the handler is on 10 divs that each has a subdiv with diff ids
[15:26:50] <PREFIX|> guess ill move my handler or some shit
[15:27:12] <JosephSilber> PREFIX|, You can definitely use children
[15:27:27] <JosephSilber> PREFIX|, $handler.children(':first-child')
[15:28:09] <JosephSilber> PREFIX|, :first-child is more efficient than :first, since it's a native CSS selector (though they don't really do the same thing)
[15:28:10] <Pasq89> thx s5fs ! btw asking in irc helps me think better of the problem/solution
[15:28:31] <PREFIX|> but will the object be similar to if i did $('#childid') ?
[15:28:38] <PREFIX|> same functionality etc?
[15:29:24] <s5fs> Pasq89: understood, sometimes explaining the issue helps clarify my thinking about problems too. :)
[15:34:13] <w00tner> im trying to set a marker in a map getting the data-latlng= from the element in the dom
[15:34:13] <w00tner> so
[15:34:17] <w00tner> var coordsUser = $(this).data('latlng');	    var marker = L.marker([coordsUser.lat, coordsUser.lng]);
[15:34:29] <w00tner> is this the correct way to separate both values?
[15:34:58] <w00tner> from: <a href="#" title="San Carlos" data-latlng="15.0002,-14.1511" id="1">
[15:35:58] <acconrad> w00tner why don't you just do data-lat and data-lng
[15:36:06] <acconrad> or is that how it has to be laid out
[15:36:26] <acconrad> otherwise you'll have to do something like this
[15:37:03] <acconrad> var market = L.market([$(this).attr('data-latlng').split(',')[0], $(this).attr('data-latlng').split(',')[1]]);
[15:38:10] <acconrad> ideally you'd do it more like this => var latlng = $(this).attr('data-latlng').split(','); var marker = L.market([latlng[0], latlng[1]]);
[15:38:20] <w00tner> data-latlng is being used by other functions so im working with it
[15:38:26] <w00tner> oh nice
[15:38:30] <w00tner> thanks!
[15:39:22] <acconrad> Is anyone aware of the best practice for upgrading from jquery-datalink? I know it was "superseded" by jsviews but that still seems to be over a year old. Any advice on what you would do now if you're just trying to upgrade?
[15:42:49] <Pavlov> has anyone settled on a good way to pass a parameter to a page with jquery mobile?
[15:51:16] <weggie> I have a quick ? about jQuery and select dropdowns if anyone has a min..
[15:51:43] <TheWarden> Hi, I have the following code https://gist.github.com/thewarden/f403efdbb4174bf719b1. For some reason instead of doing what I have coded their when the button is clicked it submits the form. How can I fix this? I put an alter() within that .click function and it is indeed getting into that fuction just oddly submitting the form.
[15:51:54] <TheWarden> when I click on the clear button or #btnClear button.
[15:53:52] <acconrad> TheWarden: is that button inside of a form tag? what is the context if this button
[15:54:14] <acconrad> when in doubt use ON instead of CLICK and start your function with preventDefault()
[15:54:17] <acconrad> so...
[15:54:49] <acconrad> $('#btnClear').on('click', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); ‚Ä¶rest of code‚Ä¶ });
[15:54:52] <TheWarden> acconrad: yes it is within a form tag. the button is just suppose to clear the selected table rows of a given table that/s the first line, reset two form fields values to empty and then disable the clear button and remove button.
[15:55:22] <acconrad> TheWarden: yeah you need to use event.preventDefault() because likely your button is of type="submit" which will by default submit your form
[15:55:44] <acconrad> TheWarden: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[15:55:58] <acconrad> weggie: what's up?
[15:56:07] <TheWarden> acconrad: well this is the html for the button, <button id="btnClear">Clear</button>
[15:56:19] <acconrad> it should be
[15:56:31] <acconrad> <button id="btnClear" type="button">Clear</button>
[15:57:34] <weggie> @acconrad: Trying to get source together but I have a link to the ? I asked on StackOverflow. It has most of the info on  there.\
[15:57:43] <weggie> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16405483/coldfusion-populate-form-with-dropdown-selection-using-ajax-part-2
[15:57:52] <TheWarden> acconrad: ohh okay, well it appears just adding the type="button" attribute that solved the problem. should I still do the event.preventDefault()?
[15:58:07] <acconrad> probably don't need to if it now owrks
[15:58:21] <TheWarden> acconrad: okay, great. Thanks so much.
[15:58:35] <weggie> The idea is that I have an ajax form returning some values that I am filling in a form with the returned values..
[15:58:51] <weggie> I want to have the dropdowns to be set
[15:59:00] <weggie> can't seen to figure it out
[15:59:20] <weggie> I tried $('#PosTitle').find('option:eq(PosVar)').prop('selected', true);
[15:59:23] <unstable> What is a good way to have a bunch of the same small graphic (a taco) bouncing around on the screen. I'm using phone gap.. so this would be jquery mobile. I wanted to use a shake event, so when shaking is occuring.. these tacos are bouncing around. I'm not sure which function/library is best to use.
[16:00:01] <weggie> where PosVal is a number. I would like to find the value where posVal = the value of the option and have that set as selected.
[16:02:56] <acconrad> weggie: okay I just posted in the stack overflow post
[16:03:39] <acconrad> I'm not a cold fusion expert by any stretch, but it looks like you have not properly encoded your Coldfusion statement into a JSON-ified string so that your AJAX request gets your data in the appropriate format
[16:04:12] <acconrad> I linked to the encode documentation so you can see an example of how to turn your raw Coldfusion data into a JSON string that jQuery can interpret
[16:05:55] <weggie> @acconrad Thanks for posting. I am getting the values back to the browser but I can't seem to get the select box to get set to one of the values that are returned.
[16:08:20] <poseidon> Hello.  I have some text that I want to make it so when you hover over it, a pop-up appears.
[16:08:23] <acconrad> weggie: well you also haven't shown the full context of your dropdown
[16:08:37] <poseidon> Any suggestions on where to look for documentation on jquery relavent to this?
[16:08:44] <acconrad> poseidon: http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/
[16:08:54] <poseidon> acconrad: perfect.  thanks!
[16:09:10] <weggie> @acconrad: I'll grab some raw html and post it up on a fiddle really quick. Thanks
[16:35:47] <wilkinsmc> is it racist to tell a customer, when they ask me whether I can break a hundred, that, "yes, I get plenty of mexicans that come in here"
[16:35:49] <wilkinsmc> ?
[16:36:01] <wilkinsmc> they were offended
[16:36:18] <wilkinsmc> but i basically have to deal with 100s 99% of the time when the customer is mexican
[16:36:49] <nsanden> mexicans or hispanics
[16:37:06] <wilkinsmc> both i guess
[16:37:18] <wilkinsmc> it's because they get paid under the table
[16:37:24] <wilkinsmc> but it's not a knock or anything, it's just the way it is
[16:38:31] <snover> I am pretty sure if you asked yoisthisracist.com you would get a better response
[16:40:12] <wilkinsmc> lol
[16:40:16] <wilkinsmc> good idea for a site, actually
[16:40:23] <snover> it would also be way less fucking off-topic
[16:40:25] <snover> there
[16:40:26] <wilkinsmc> imgur for borderline racist stuff
[16:40:31] <mehwork> if you need to do a lot of javascript/css customization, and loading of external files, is jQuery Mobile not a good choice?
[16:54:22] <shoelessone> So I have what may be a stupid-ish question: I'm trying to load jQuery or Zepto conditionally, depending on the browser, using a snippet from Foundation (Zurb), but the problem is that my javascript script requires jQuery to run
[16:55:03] <shoelessone> https://gist.github.com/develpr/66153ca35a6bc32f31c0
[16:55:16] <snover> shoelessone: yes, using zepto is a stupid idea
[16:55:18] <shoelessone> I'm wondering what the normal strategy is for handling this
[16:55:51] <shoelessone> snover: sorry, i wasn't clear, what I meant is that my application specific javascript require jquery OR zepto to run
[16:56:15] <wilkinsmc> shoe: why not just use $.browser
[16:56:18] <snover> i suspect your application code requires jquery, because zepto isn‚Äôt an api-compatible replacement for jquery
[16:56:33] <shoelessone> snover: well, even if I removed zepto, the issue is the same.
[16:56:47] <shoelessone> i.e. the problem is with document.write(
[16:57:04] <shoelessone> I think, because that is loading jQuery the library after
[16:57:53] <shoelessone> So this gives me the same problem: https://gist.github.com/develpr/d2aaaf3028b6d6975afd
[16:58:20] <shoelessone> Zepto really has nothing to do with the issue I don't think, and it's not so much an issue as much as it's a "i don't know the proper way to do this" type of situation!
[16:58:45] <snover> well if the issue is with zurb code, then you should ask‚Ä¶zurb.
[16:59:10] <vladikoff> bot-t: tell zurb, fix it
[16:59:10] <bot-t> vladikoff, Okay.
[17:00:43] <shoelessone> Well, I don't really think it has anything to do with zurb or zeptos, it's more a general javascript question I think
[17:01:05] <shoelessone> I know some other libraries/tools/frameowkrs/whatever use the document.write "method" for including javascript conditionally
[17:01:35] <vladikoff> shoelessone, did you read this http://zurb.com/article/1180/how-to-use-foundation-4-s-faster-better-a ?
[17:03:04] <vladikoff> shoelessone, 'the problem is that my javascript script requires jQuery to run' if your code requires jquery to run why use that snippet?
[17:03:23] <shoelessone> vladikoff: that was an incorrect statement I really regret making!
[17:03:29] <shoelessone> I mispoke
[17:03:36] <vladikoff> shoelessone, no worries
[17:03:41] <shoelessone> what I meant to say was, "my javascript requires zepto OR jquery to run"
[17:04:07] <vladikoff> shoelessone, yeah so you get an error with document.write ?
[17:05:00] <shoelessone> No, I get an error because even though I include my javascript via <script...> AFTER the document.write "includes" the jQuery/Zepto library, I think the browser goes straight to my javascript before it actually loads the jquery/zepto libary
[17:05:03] <shoelessone> if that makes sense
[17:06:06] <shoelessone> normally the browser would load and parse the <script src="jquery.js"></script> first, then load my <script src="myapp.js"></script>, and that would be perfect
[17:06:56] <shoelessone> but I THINK, because it's using document.write it's writing that and then going to my <script src="myapp.js"></script> before it actually processes the jquery/zepto include
[17:07:09] <shoelessone> again, I think this is probably something very easy to solve, I just don't know how people normally handle it
[17:11:21] <PREFIX|> since this is driving me crazy. onmouseover, how would I set the CSS of the next sibling to $(this) (adjacent div so to speak)
[17:25:55] <chieftaco> I'm looking for a senior member of the jQuery team.. if any of you guys are around could you /msg me please? Thanks!
[17:27:36] * chieftaco remembers it's been a good minute since he's been on IRC..
[17:31:56] <coldhead> SURRENDER REND IT IT'S YOURS
[17:32:29] <tw2113> stop raising cain coldhead
[17:33:07] <tw2113> cain raising is a 2nd day perk, not 1st
[17:33:29] <vladikoff> chieftaco, coldhead is your man
[17:33:39] <chieftaco> thanks!
[17:34:07] <coldhead> vladikoff: it is my first day using jQuery. you dunt.
[17:35:11] <s5fs> chieftaco: I'm not senior, but what's on your mind?
[17:36:33] <chieftaco> i'm getting ready to release a product, and wanted to 1) make sure you guys are okay with it, and 2) offer you guys the product free for life since it uses jQuery and jQuery UI..
[17:36:36] * tw2113 drinks his coffee
[17:36:57] <pootietang> sup peeps!
[17:36:58] <s5fs> chieftaco: what's the license?
[17:37:17] <chieftaco> licensed..
[17:37:31] <andkore> lol
[17:37:31] <chieftaco> (but cheap)..
[17:38:04] <andkore> chieftaco: is your project a modification of jquery, or merely a project that uses the API?
[17:38:16] <chieftaco> just trying to feed my son and get back some of the years i've been working on this
[17:38:24] <chieftaco> not a modification, an engine..
[17:38:29] <chieftaco> www.webappsassin.com
[17:38:45] <chieftaco> (sorry for the link, but there's more than one of you asking..)
[17:39:20] <Forbidd3n> any way to toggle show and hide based on value?
[17:39:22] <andkore> yeah, a project like that isn't really affected by open source licenses
[17:39:27] <Forbidd3n> besides if/else
[17:39:41] <andkore> because you're just using the API, not modifying the jquery code
[17:39:50] <andkore> so you can release it under any license you want (IANAL)
[17:39:56] <s5fs> Forbidd3n: for boolean values, I like to do "myvar = !myvar"
[17:40:35] <Forbidd3n> s5fs: how would you put that in a toggle show hide
[17:40:46] <chieftaco> i know, i just want to make sure you guys don't get upset, and also see if you wanted me to do any type of special delivery, like retrieving from jquery.com or something.
[17:41:04] <andkore> don't hotlink to jquery's copy
[17:41:07] <andkore> use google's jquery cdn
[17:41:21] <chieftaco> done. thanks!
[17:41:40] <andkore> I'm not a jquery dev. I'm just giving you advice...
[17:42:00] <mashlol> Forbidd3n: http://api.jquery.com/toggle/#toggle-showOrHide
[17:42:02] <s5fs> chieftaco: I suggest asking #jquery-dev if they have any interest in your product. I'm still new.
[17:43:12] <chieftaco> s5fs: i'm sure you know someone if noone who answered is a dev, and I'd really hate to ask again in a public channel, because I'm really not trying to put the product out there just yet..
[17:43:15] <andkore>  $.post("index.php", ... <-- what's happening in that code? what is '$'? I know it's an alias for jQuery, but what is it? it can't be a function because it doesn't have parens
[17:43:46] <mashlol> It's an object andkore
[17:44:01] <andkore> but I haven't instantiated it?
[17:45:11] <s5fs> chieftaco: I'm just a lowly volunteer, not sure how I can help you. My personal, non-official advice is to keep hacking on your product until you're ready to go public. At that point, shop it around again and see if anyone is interested.
[17:45:22] <mashlol> var a = function(printVar){console.log(printVar);}; a.printNothing = function(){};
[17:45:51] <mashlol> you can then do a("test"); and also a.printNothing();
[17:45:54] <chieftaco> It's ready, just waiting on lawyer paperwork..
[17:45:57] <andkore> hm ok
[17:46:08] <s5fs> chieftaco: If you're worried about licensing or legality, I suggest you contact a lawyer familiar with your country's laws etc. Haha, perfect!
[17:47:54] <chieftaco> thanks everyone for you help.. i'm out for now.
[17:48:01] <s5fs> chieftaco: take care and good luck!

[19:30:18] <magixx321> I'm trying to get the value from a function which uses getJSON and returns the value in the call back, yet I am getting undefined upon return, any ideas why?
[19:30:36] <magixx321> if i log the value before returning it it is correct
[19:31:47] <JosephSilber> magixx321, you can't return anything from an asyncrounous callback
[19:31:57] <magixx321> :(
[19:32:04] <JosephSilber> Whatever you want to do with that data has to happen within the callback
[19:32:33] <coldhead> well said
[19:32:34] <magixx321> how do i save the variable retrieved then? am i forced to use syncrhronous function type?
[19:32:37] <js_doode> nevermind pathing error :P
[19:32:55] <coldhead> magixx321: you are forced to do all your work with that variable within the callback
[19:33:11] <coldhead> you don't try to save it
[19:33:20] <coldhead> you say "when i get this value, here are the things to do with it"
[19:33:30] <tw2113> could you not define a function ahead of time and pass the data into that, one that you setup outside the getJSON method
[19:33:31] <hugo_moss> coldhead: i solved my problem yesterday
[19:33:43] <hugo_moss> i just thought you would like to know
[19:33:43] <coldhead> way to be, hugo_moss
[19:33:51] <hugo_moss> r u proud
[19:34:07] <coldhead> you will never understand how proud
[19:34:14] <coldhead> it is as though my entire life were leading to this moment
[19:34:20] <coldhead> which in a very real and important way it was
[19:34:23] <magixx321> if i do all the functions within the callback then there will be redundant code dupolication
[19:35:07] <hugo_moss> thank u coldhead
[19:35:09] <hugo_moss> thank u
[19:35:20] <coldhead> there doesn't have to be, magixx321
[19:35:24] <coldhead> you can use functions
[19:35:25] <tw2113> define the function outside the callback
[19:35:29] <coldhead> and call them where you need them
[19:35:29] <tw2113> invoke it inside it
[19:37:06] <magixx321> that changes the 'functions' of my functions, if for example all i want to do is for a function to retrieve the id of some data from a database, should i not be using getJSON?
[19:37:25] <hugo_moss> coldhead: do you want me to share with you the solution, as it may help someone in the future
[19:37:38] <hugo_moss> and increase your knowledge
[19:38:35] <coldhead> sure, let's do that
[19:38:43] <hugo_moss> ok
[19:38:49] <hugo_moss> #1
[19:39:05] <hugo_moss> jquery and prototype may be used together
[19:39:15] <coldhead> magixx321: it sounds like you want to do more than just get an ID. it sounds like you want to get the ID and DO STUFF WITH IT
[19:39:53] <hugo_moss> all kidding aside
[19:40:13] <hugo_moss> it was just that bootstrap was making an event with the name "show" and "hide" and "toggle"
[19:40:16] <hugo_moss> and triggering that event
[19:40:20] <hugo_moss> when the event was triggered
[19:40:25] <hugo_moss> it would use prototypes version
[19:40:37] <hugo_moss> because prototype was loaded and has the same exact names
[19:40:46] <hugo_moss> but what i dont understand
[19:40:47] <magixx321> yea i want to get the id, then depending on what 'view' mode mode the user is in different things may be need to be done with that id
[19:40:48] <coldhead> man that must have been hell to debug
[19:41:11] <hugo_moss> pls dont be sarcastic coldhead
[19:41:39] <coldhead> magixx321: so that's usually expressed as $.getJSON('someurl', function (data) { handleIDChange(data.id); })
[19:41:43] <coldhead> or words to that effect
[19:41:52] <magixx321> yea
[19:42:00] <hugo_moss> i would have found it in one minute if i remembered that i was using prototype
[19:42:13] <hugo_moss> but what i dont understand is, why does it call prototypes method?
[19:42:23] <hugo_moss> i still dont understand
[19:42:28] <hugo_moss> prototype is using the alias $
[19:42:37] <hugo_moss> but when i call it, i use $jq191
[19:42:44] <hugo_moss> using a jquery no conflict variable
[19:42:53] <magixx321> but if i do all the changes in the callback, that function is nolonger a function to get an id, its a function for doing something with the id
[19:43:21] <coldhead> two functions, magixx321
[19:43:30] <coldhead> one to get the ID and do something with it, and one to do something with it
[19:43:50] <b1lly1> BALLS
[19:43:51] <coldhead> fetchIDAndUpdate() which calls updateWithID()
[19:43:54] <coldhead> or such like
[19:44:42] <magixx321> and there is the redundancy
[19:45:01] <tw2113> what redundancy? invoking functions?
[19:45:17] <coldhead> between redundancy and vapourware i'd take redundancy and get on with my life
[19:45:58] <Forbidd3n> how would I select all inputs where name !=
[19:46:07] <hugo_moss> what are we talking about here
[19:46:12] <hugo_moss> whats the topic
[19:46:16] <Forbidd3n> $('input[name!="name"]')...
[19:46:22] <tw2113> jQuery, hugo_moss
[19:46:32] <hugo_moss> wait, this isnt prototype
[19:46:37] <coldhead> hugo_moss: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love Asychronous Callback Methodology
[19:46:37] <hugo_moss> o snap
[19:47:20] <hugo_moss> whats the problem with that methodology
[19:47:26] <hugo_moss> or what he thinks is wrong with it
[19:48:06] <Forbidd3n> anyone?
[19:48:24] <hugo_moss> hold on forbidd
[19:48:34] <hugo_moss> let me look it up
[19:48:52] <Forbidd3n> I found it I think
[19:49:06] <Forbidd3n> hugo_moss: I gave an example, just checking if the syntax is correct
[19:49:16] <JosephSilber> http://callbackhell.com/
[19:49:44] <magixx321> here is the example: i want have multiple functions (a,b,c,d) where i  may need this id, they all need it for different purposes and do different things with the id,  depending on user settings not all of abcd may need to be used, currently i want to just call whatever i need of abcd depending on what a user does, this gets ugly if I just do it all in one callback
[19:49:45] <hugo_moss> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-not-equal-selector/
[19:50:01] <hugo_moss> <script>$('input[name!="newsletter"]').next().append('<b>; not newsletter</b>');</script>
[19:50:11] <hugo_moss> yea thats jquerys example
[19:50:13] <hugo_moss> so it should work
[19:51:47] <coldhead> magixx321: if you can be bothered getting your head around it you might like to look at using deferreds
[19:51:55] <hugo_moss> nice link JosephSilber
[19:51:58] <hugo_moss> bookmarked
[19:52:16] <coldhead> where you can make your code "wait" for someting (like an ID via AJAX) and it will run straight away if the deferred is already completed
[19:52:42] <adavia> Anybody knows how can i make 2 autocompletes dependable each other?
[19:52:47] <JosephSilber> hugo_moss, I don't think what you're trying to do should be as complicated as you think it is. If you post some code (maybe a fiddle) I'll try to help you
[19:54:04] <hugo_moss> i think you mean Forbidd3n
[19:54:08] <hugo_moss> joseph
[19:54:25] <hugo_moss> did it work forbidd3n
[19:54:52] <hugo_moss> adavia: what do you mean depend on each other?
[19:56:07] <adavia> hugo_moss:  lets say i have a text field where i populate brand of cars, if i select one then i want to populate the car models in other autocomplete field
[19:56:33] <coldhead> adavia: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/854075/jquery-autocomplete-chained-requests
[19:56:33] <nesoi> can I have $(document).bind('pagechange', function(event)  in multiple different js files which are all included in the same index.html, and use them for different pages? or will that not work or will there be overhead or strange bugs?
[19:56:51] <coldhead> nesoi: whatever you do, there will ALWAYS be strange bugs
[19:57:00] <nesoi> I mean as a result of doing that !
[19:57:38] <nesoi> ie: is there overhead or are there problems having two or more of those statements in the same file?
[19:57:58] <mashlol> you should use .on() now
[19:58:02] <mashlol> but it should be fine
[19:59:23] <nesoi> so just substitute .on for .bind
[19:59:54] <nesoi> is this the most efficient way to do something on pagechange to a particular page?

[20:09:49] <hugo_moss> coldhead whats your background on javascript and interests in programming
[20:10:15] <hugo_moss> how long have you been programming/using javascript
[20:10:26] <coldhead> i've been terrible at JS since before 9/11
[20:10:45] <coldhead> it seems to be getting worse
[20:10:49] <snover> twss
[20:10:51] <hugo_moss> how before
[20:10:59] <hugo_moss> how long exactly
[20:11:01] <coldhead> but mostly i work in photoshop
[20:11:05] <snover> twss
[20:11:06] <coldhead> save for web and devices
[20:11:20] <hugo_moss> are u being serious
[20:11:23] <hugo_moss> or sarcastic
[20:11:28] <hugo_moss> this is irc
[20:11:30] <hugo_moss> i cant tell
[20:11:33] <coldhead> i don't know how long exactly, i'd have to search my diary for "dear diary, tday i wrote my first javascript"
[20:11:41] <hugo_moss> ok sarcasm
[20:11:47] <coldhead> anyway it doesn't matter, everything changed on 9/11
[20:11:59] <coldhead> there was pre-9/11 JS and JS after 9/11
[20:12:24] <hugo_moss> what frameworks do you use
[20:12:27] <coldhead> things aren't always sarcastic or not sarcastic, hugo_moss
[20:12:28] <hugo_moss> or have experience in
[20:12:31] <coldhead> there's a rich spectrum
[20:12:42] <coldhead> mostly photoshop, a little bit of jquery
[20:12:44] <coldhead> that's about it
[20:13:04] <hugo_moss> what do you do for a living
[20:13:12] <coldhead> save for web, mostly
[20:13:12] <hugo_moss> are you a web designer
[20:13:16] <coldhead> god no
[20:13:21] <hugo_moss> a web developer
[20:13:25] <hugo_moss> a front end developer
[20:13:27] <hugo_moss> php developer
[20:13:30] <coldhead> junior front end developer
[20:13:32] <hugo_moss> programmer
[20:13:38] <hugo_moss> ok
[20:13:40] <coldhead> brackets photoshop save for web brackets
[20:14:01] <hugo_moss> what do you save your images in
[20:14:03] <hugo_moss> what format
[20:14:19] <coldhead> png mostly
[20:14:24] <hugo_moss> you like using png or jpg
[20:14:27] <coldhead> sometimes jpgs
[20:14:30] <hugo_moss> yea im a png guy too
[20:14:37] <coldhead> i like about 85% compression on my jpgs
[20:14:45] <hugo_moss> 85 that was a good year
[20:14:55] <coldhead> yeah good year in music
[20:15:36] <hugo_moss> do you use png just for the alpha transparency
[20:16:49] <magixx321> i'm now trying to load an image an image with getJSON and then set the location of where the image is loaded to the correct properties dependiong on the image, yet something is out of sync and the properties are not correctly seen because the image apparently has not loaded, what am I doin wrong? http://pastebin.com/bWReiwjF
[20:17:59] <hugo_moss> let me see
[20:22:18] <hugo_moss> magixx321: is the JSON output in the correct format?
[20:22:45] <magixx321> yes
[20:22:59] <magixx321> the image loads fine
[20:23:20] <magixx321> but when i click it the first time it will output 0
[20:23:28] <magixx321> then the correct width
[20:24:08] <magixx321> then depending on luck it may be 0 or the correct width
[20:24:24] <hugo_moss> do you have a jsfiddle
[20:24:37] <magixx321> iyes
[20:24:38] <magixx321> well
[20:24:42] <magixx321> its a website
[20:24:53] <magixx321> and getting json is not possible within it as far as i know
[20:25:00] <magixx321> since i am using a local server
[20:25:22] <Forbidd3n> if I do $('input') does that include hidden inputs or just visible ones?
[20:26:02] <mashlol> all inputs
[20:26:13] <hugo_moss> magixx can you paste me the json data you get
[20:26:16] <mashlol> $('input:visible') for visible ones iirc
[20:26:37] <hugo_moss> the json output from getjson
[20:26:50] <hugo_moss> the output from the php url
[20:28:09] <magixx321> {"id":"100","page":"100","bookcode":"100jzbg","file":"100 jazz & blues greats_Page_100_Image_0001.png"}
[20:28:16] <tw2113> ping SlexAxton non jQuery Q for you
[20:28:26] <magixx321> i dont see how that will help
[20:30:28] <hugo_moss> ok so basically you're trying to make an image on click to show another image, and you want it to use the width and height of the new image?
[20:31:00] <magixx321> yea
[20:31:12] <magixx321> but since tabs have a display:none when hidden
[20:31:32] <magixx321> i need to chnage that, make it invisisble, get info the set it to original state
[20:32:15] <hugo_moss> why are you not sending the image width/height as json?
[20:32:25] <hugo_moss> what is the imageId?
[20:32:57] <magixx321> imageid is the id in the database
[20:33:02] <hugo_moss> ok
[20:33:14] <magixx321> the image width is determinned by max-height in css
[20:33:18] <magixx321> so it cannot be sent
[20:33:27] <Forbidd3n> any way to count a radio group as one input instead of separate entities?
[20:34:18] <hugo_moss> ok magix
[20:34:22] <hugo_moss> i think i have a solution
[20:34:35] <hugo_moss> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1643858/image-native-width-in-jquery
[20:34:57] <hugo_moss> var newimage = new Image();
[20:34:58] <hugo_moss> newimage.src = 'retouche-hr' + newlinkimage + '-a.jpg'; // path to image
[20:34:58] <hugo_moss> var width = newimage.width;
[20:35:03] <b1lly1> whats the problem you have?
[20:35:43] <magixx321> that does not help
[20:35:53] <b1lly1> magixx321: explain what your doing?
[20:35:58] <hugo_moss> why not?
[20:36:05] <hugo_moss> it loads the image into an image object and javascript
[20:36:08] <b1lly1> Forbidd3n: don't they count as one input?
[20:36:12] <hugo_moss> and it reads the images native width and height
[20:36:14] <b1lly1> just give them the same name?
[20:36:38] <hugo_moss> that images native width and height,
[20:36:47] <Forbidd3n> any way to count a radio group as one input instead of separate entities?
[20:36:55] <magixx321> since i have css that uses max-height for an image, so getting the original image width or height is kinda useless
[20:37:06] <b1lly1> Forbidd3n: you need to clarify
[20:37:07] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[20:37:20] <b1lly1> magixx321: what are you trying to accomplish
[20:37:34] <hugo_moss> what width and height is it you're trying to get
[20:37:53] <Forbidd3n> b1lly1: I have three radio buttons for example name="myRadios" and if I do .length on input I get 3, I need the count to be 1
[20:38:01] <Forbidd3n> since they are grouped as one entity
[20:38:07] <Forbidd3n> even though they are separate inputs
[20:38:17] <b1lly1> uh
[20:38:18] <magixx321> height is dynamically set
[20:38:28] <b1lly1> select them by name
[20:38:40] <hugo_moss> oh ok
[20:38:42] <tw2113> just select them all then isolate the first one
[20:38:45] <hugo_moss> the height is dynamically set
[20:38:47] <Forbidd3n> b1lly1: I need to do it for all groups
[20:38:56] <hugo_moss> what about the width?
[20:38:57] <Forbidd3n> without specifying each name group
[20:39:05] <hugo_moss> so what are you doing? you're scaling the image?
[20:39:07] <b1lly1> Forbidd3n: is there a wrapper around each group?
[20:39:25] <magixx321> the image is scaled with max-height in css
[20:39:28] <hugo_moss> isnt that distorting the image quality?
[20:39:29] <magixx321> i need its width
[20:39:37] <Forbidd3n> yeah, but it is the same wrapper for inputs text fields as well
[20:39:58] <b1lly1> can you propose the full problem
[20:40:12] <Forbidd3n> that is what I am trying to do
[20:40:19] <b1lly1> for what reason
[20:40:21] <Forbidd3n> get grouped radios to count as one input
[20:40:27] <b1lly1> but why
[20:40:27] <magixx321> image is loaded in place where display: none so it cannot be easily gotten
[20:40:34] <Forbidd3n> for a complete % of all fields
[20:40:42] <b1lly1> oh
[20:40:43] <Forbidd3n> for the percent complete meter
[20:40:50] <b1lly1> so
[20:40:55] <b1lly1> what you want to do is
[20:42:06] <magixx321> basically i need this http://pastebin.com/bWReiwjF to run in order
[20:42:12] <magixx321> but it is not doing so
[20:43:20] <Forbidd3n> b1lly1: I thought about looping the inputs and storeing each name in array
[20:43:24] <Forbidd3n> check array prior to counting
[20:43:25] <b1lly1> the total options = $('input[type="radio"]:checked').length / $('wrapper').length
[20:43:27] <Forbidd3n> work?
[20:43:40] <Forbidd3n> b1lly1 : no radio is checked by default
[20:43:53] <b1lly1> so then they should be 100% complete by default
[20:43:58] <b1lly1> lol
[20:44:13] <Forbidd3n> no it would be 0% by default
[20:44:14] <RobW> any javascript guru's available for hire? it's for javascript/frontend to work on an existing custom framework
[20:44:38] <b1lly1> Forbidd3n: if they are all selected by default, then the user can just click submit without changing anything?>
[20:45:15] <Forbidd3n> correct, that is why none are selected so they have to select one
[20:45:26] <hugo_moss> ok magixx321,
[20:45:35] <b1lly1> Forbidd3n: so my solution would be fine
[20:46:05] <Forbidd3n> b1lly1: there is no default radio checked for each group
[20:46:09] <hugo_moss> you have an image, what is the width set to when you set a max-height?
[20:46:16] <Forbidd3n> they have to select one for each group
[20:46:18] <hugo_moss> like an example
[20:46:19] <b1lly1> which is why it would return 0 checked out of / total wrappers
[20:46:24] <b1lly1> and thus be 0%
[20:46:38] <b1lly1> you have 1 wrapper per group
[20:46:39] <Forbidd3n> let me try what you have thanks
[20:46:49] <b1lly1> so the wrapper gives you the total number of "options" right?
[20:46:57] <b1lly1> and then you want to know the total number of selected
[20:47:05] <b1lly1> which you could use :checked
[20:47:24] <Forbidd3n> yeah, but I wasn't passing wrapper as an argument to my percentComplete function
[20:47:51] <Forbidd3n> this counts input text fields as well
[20:48:10] <b1lly1> $('input[type="radio"]:checked')
[20:48:13] <b1lly1> should only count radio
[20:48:23] <b1lly1> IF you want to
[20:48:30] <b1lly1> you can give all your radio buttons a class
[20:48:33] <Forbidd3n> right, but I need to count all inputs and one of each radio group
[20:48:38] <b1lly1> and do .radio:checked
[20:48:52] <b1lly1> so then
[20:49:01] <b1lly1> you just figured out how many radio buttons were
[20:49:06] <b1lly1> now figure out the others...
[20:49:10] <mashlol> you could also nest the radios inside a container
[20:49:11] <Forbidd3n> if I pass the wrapper
[20:49:18] <mashlol> $(".container > input[type=radio]")
[20:49:29] <Forbidd3n> but wrapper only applies to radio not textfields
[20:49:38] <b1lly1> use arithmetic dude
[20:50:18] <b1lly1> you could give every option a wrapper, or a class
[20:50:40] <b1lly1> and use that as your (total number of questions)
[20:51:05] <b1lly1> then you have your total number of :checked (radio)  +  [figure out total number of other stuff here]
[20:53:27] <hugo_moss> magixx321: ok, what you want is just the width. the height is some max-height that is set, this only restricts it to some max-height, and so you do not care about this value
[20:53:38] <hugo_moss> so you need to send the width as json in css
[20:53:55] <hugo_moss> from css
[20:54:01] <magixx321> yea
[20:54:05] <hugo_moss> thats the only way
[20:54:28] <magixx321> no
[20:54:45] <hugo_moss> well
[20:54:47] <magixx321> the code i posted should be able to run sequentially
[20:54:49] <b1lly1> brb sec
[20:55:36] <b1lly> back
[20:55:56] <magixx321> if the image original is 500x500, max-height is 250, then the css code will make the image width be 250
[20:56:11] <b1lly> magixx321: so return the CSS value
[20:56:11] <magixx321> i dont care about the original image size
[20:56:33] <hugo_moss> you dont even need to set the width do you?
[20:56:41] <hugo_moss> just set width: auto
[20:56:45] <magixx321> the image itself does not have a width value
[20:57:00] <magixx321> the area in which the image is located has display:none
[20:57:11] <b1lly> magixx321: WTB JSFIDDLE
[20:57:12] <magixx321> this results in 0 being returned
[20:57:13] <b1lly> now
[20:57:20] <b1lly> your making this way more complicated
[20:57:22] <b1lly> then it needs to be
[20:57:25] <hugo_moss> yea this is not complicated
[20:57:26] <b1lly> make a test case
[20:57:29] <hugo_moss> just post a jsfiddle
[20:57:39] <hugo_moss> cause i dont get what you want
[20:57:57] <magixx321> please explain how i am gonna use getjson from jsfiddle
[20:58:03] <b1lly> your not
[20:58:06] <b1lly> but
[20:58:11] <coldhead> tw2113: http://i.imgur.com/73jobJO.jpg
[20:58:12] <b1lly> you can take a json sample
[20:58:20] <b1lly> and post it into the javascript box
[20:58:24] <hugo_moss> he can
[20:58:25] <b1lly> and make a test case
[20:58:32] <hugo_moss> he can use the url he has if its a live server
[20:58:42] <magixx321> i've posted paste bin
[20:58:47] <hugo_moss> jsfiddle.net
[20:58:49] <b1lly> use jsfiddle.net
[20:58:56] <hugo_moss> create a sample json
[20:59:03] <hugo_moss> and use the sample
[21:00:21] <magixx321> http://jsfiddle.net/qCCHk/
[21:00:40] <magixx321> in stuff i load an image
[21:00:48] <magixx321> i then call setDisplaySize
[21:00:51] <hugo_moss> ok use the html
[21:00:55] <hugo_moss> create the html elements
[21:01:06] <hugo_moss> and use the css dialog box
[21:01:19] <leehong1> hi there...I am new to JQuery....but I would like to learn how to click a button on a web page using jquery..thanks
[21:01:28] <b1lly> CLICK a button?
[21:01:32] <b1lly> or listen for a click?
[21:01:51] <b1lly> $('selector').trigger('click');
[21:01:59] <SlexAxton> sup tw2113
[21:02:12] <magixx321> the stuff in setDisplaySize runs in such a way that it returns the width either correctly or in correctly
[21:02:28] <leehong1> I am using a programme called AHK.. to click button on webpage
[21:02:49] <b1lly> ::golfclap::
[21:04:04] <leehong1> @billy....I went thru the youtube tuts....It is all about setting up a webpage
[21:04:41] <b1lly> coldhead: is it just me
[21:05:13] <hugo_moss> have patience billy
[21:05:28] <magixx321> http://jsfiddle.net/VUNmx/
[21:05:30] <b1lly> yeah
[21:05:32] <hugo_moss> i dont have any left
[21:05:35] <magixx321> it is useless
[21:05:35] <b1lly> haha
[21:05:41] <hugo_moss> so you need to have patience for both of us
[21:05:44] <magixx321> i've identified the problem
[21:06:21] <magixx321> posting code which has nothing to do with the way images are loaded will not help fix it
[21:07:07] <b1lly> i'm glad you figured that one out
[21:07:13] <b1lly> :D
[21:07:20] <magixx321> i have not fixed my problem
[21:07:34] <b1lly> I was being sarcastic about your second statement
[21:07:55] <b1lly> what WOULD help us, is to see a sample JSON
[21:07:57] <b1lly> response
[21:08:00] <b1lly> from your ajax call
[21:08:07] <b1lly> in this test case
[21:08:12] <magixx321> (11:28:01 PM) magixx321: {"id":"100","page":"100","bookcode":"100jzbg","file":"100 jazz & blues greats_Page_100_Image_0001.png"}
[21:08:22] <hugo_moss> ok put that sample in there
[21:08:33] <hugo_moss> use it
[21:08:39] <hugo_moss> use that as the sample for the json
[21:09:31] <tw2113> how comfortable is your github hoodie? I'm curious if the $55 price is worth it SlexAxton
[21:09:50] <SlexAxton> i mean no hoodie is _worth_ $55
[21:09:56] <SlexAxton> but it's pretty comfortable
[21:10:10] <SlexAxton> how'd you know I have one, have we met and I didn't know?
[21:10:13] <b1lly> so magixx321: your json returns a "file" name right?
[21:10:22] <tw2113> some video on twitter tonight
[21:10:29] <tw2113> i noticed you wearing it
[21:10:29] <coldhead> comfort comfort comfort
[21:10:33] <coldhead> are we so vain
[21:10:34] <b1lly> and you want to use that file, and determine it's width?
[21:10:36] <magixx321> yes
[21:10:39] <b1lly> but the css set's it's max width
[21:10:47] <magixx321> i dont userstand why you care about what the json is
[21:10:48] <b1lly> so it's width could NOT be the actual image width?
[21:10:52] <magixx321> it is irrelevant
[21:10:58] <magixx321> yes
[21:11:10] <b1lly> ok
[21:11:12] <magixx321> css sets max-height
[21:11:19] <magixx321> then the image has some wifth
[21:11:24] <magixx321> what idk
[21:11:24] <b1lly> so
[21:11:26] <b1lly> why not
[21:11:27] <b1lly> just do
[21:11:38] <b1lly> why not just GET THE REAL image width
[21:11:43] <SlexAxton> ah that vid, yea
[21:11:43] <tw2113> whatever this is for SlexAxton http://vimeo.com/43972294
[21:11:45] <b1lly> and IF its GREATER THEN MAX_WIDTH
[21:11:49] <b1lly> then return max-width
[21:11:50] <SlexAxton> that was for work
[21:11:54] <b1lly> else return image width
[21:12:05] <magixx321> image has max-height
[21:12:19] <b1lly> image has max-height and max-width
[21:12:21] <b1lly> ok
[21:12:22] <magixx321> i need its width when its being limited by max height
[21:12:22] <b1lly> so
[21:12:26] <tw2113> i'm thinking i'll put it on my wishlist and go for a coffee mug first
[21:12:29] <b1lly> why not add it to the page
[21:12:34] <b1lly> sec
[21:12:36] <b1lly> let me show you
[21:12:47] <magixx321> i am adding it to the page
[21:12:57] <magixx321> in a place that has display: none style
[21:13:08] <hugo_moss> ok
[21:13:12] <hugo_moss> finally
[21:13:13] <magixx321> so then i need to change this while hifinh it
[21:13:13] <hugo_moss> i see
[21:13:22] <hugo_moss> this is ajax
[21:13:23] <magixx321> *hiding
[21:13:28] <hugo_moss> so the calls are asynchronous
[21:13:40] <hugo_moss> that means they arent guaranteed to run in order
[21:13:46] <magixx321> i know that
[21:13:46] <b1lly> can you not use $('img').width() ?
[21:13:50] <magixx321> no
[21:13:54] <b1lly> why
[21:13:54] <magixx321> well
[21:14:05] <magixx321> after i set i unhide it
[21:14:14] <magixx321> i can get its width
[21:14:19] <magixx321> but as i said before
[21:14:29] <magixx321> function setDisplaySize(){
[21:14:35] <magixx321> is not returning the correct width
[21:15:20] <magixx321> it's either returning 0 or the correct width, depending on if the image is loaded  and visisble or not
[21:15:34] <b1lly> magix
[21:15:59] <b1lly> $('img').load(function() { alert($(this).width()); })
[21:16:07] <b1lly> will wait for the image to be loaded
[21:16:16] <b1lly> and then return its width
[21:20:24] <ProLoser> how can i do offset() without jquery?
[21:20:52] <b1lly> so
[21:20:59] <b1lly> without jquery at all?
[21:21:14] <b1lly> you're familiar with getElementById, class, tagname, etc>
[21:21:38] <magixx321> if i add that within setDisplaySize it now always returns 0 as its width
[21:23:20] <ProLoser> i can select the DOM element
[21:23:25] <ProLoser> i just need to retrieve the offset
[21:23:33] <ProLoser> i'm using angular, and want to remove the jquery dependency
[21:23:38] <ProLoser> unfortunately offset is not part of the api
[21:23:59] <b1lly> var el = document.getElementById('myid');
[21:24:03] <b1lly> el.offsetTop;
[21:24:06] <b1lly> el.offsetLeft;
[21:24:35] <b1lly> should work fine
[21:24:56] <b1lly> offsetLeft, offsetTop are all properties of the DOM object
[21:25:05] <b1lly> so is scrollLeft and scrollTop
[21:25:11] <JosephSilber> angular.element('#id').offsetTop
[21:25:36] <JosephSilber> angular.element('#id')[0].offsetTop
[21:25:49] <b1lly> or just do it with regular javascript
[21:27:04] <b1lly> magixx321: your doing something wrong
[21:33:23] <magixx321> yes, conents in setDisplaySize are not running sequentially and I do not know why or how to get them to do so
[21:36:18] <lenswipee> Howdy folks!
[21:43:12] <Forbidd3n> b1lly: can you help me with how I would get all visible elements for this - var fields = $(this).find(':text, textarea, select');
[21:44:45] <Forbidd3n> or anyone else
[21:46:17] <coldhead> magixx321: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/wrangle-async-tasks-with-jquery-promises/
[21:47:03] <wad3g> I could use some assistance with jQuery/AJAX if anyone's available to chat
[21:47:51] <Cork> ?ask
[21:47:51] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

[21:48:01] <Forbidd3n> I tried this, but no luck - $(this).find('input[type!="radio"]:visible, textarea:visible, select:visible')
[21:48:18] <Cork> != isn't a valid selector
[21:48:43] <Cork> $(this).find('input:visible, textarea:visible, select:visible').not('[type="radio"]')
[21:49:32] <Forbidd3n> so this is wrong as well then? -- var radios = $(this).find('input[type="radio"]:visible').not('.not-percent');
[21:49:44] <magixx321> http://jsbin.com/efejop/1/edit
[21:49:59] <Cork> Forbidd3n: no that would be valid
[21:50:00] <magixx321> is a fully working example
[21:50:12] <wad3g> I need to grab a cookie, assuming by using $.cookie.get('name'), then do a GET request to send server-side
[21:50:18] <magixx321> width is somethimes returned correctly and sometimes not
[21:58:38] <Forbidd3n> does .is(":empty") work if a select doesn't have a selected value?
[21:58:53] <coldhead> ?:empty
[21:58:54] <bot-t> :empty: Select all elements that have no children (including text nodes). http://api.jquery.com/empty-selector/
[21:58:58] <coldhead> nope
[22:00:36] <Forbidd3n> coldhead: if(!$(this).val()) would be true if textarea, text field and select are empty correct?
[22:01:01] <Cork> ?eval !""
[22:01:03] <bot-t> Cork: true
[22:01:24] <magixx321> ?eval 1/0
[22:01:25] <bot-t> magixx321: Infinity
[22:01:36] <magixx321> :(
[22:01:51] <coldhead> ?eval 'gypsies'.split('').join('-')
[22:01:52] <bot-t> coldhead: "g-y-p-s-i-e-s"
[22:02:16] <`teh1> anyone know of any circumstances where $('#element') works and shows all the correct children but $('element existingChild') returns nothing selected?
[22:02:17] <coldhead> bye Kevin
[22:02:29] <`teh1> oops #element*
[22:02:53] <Cork> ?p @ `teh1
[22:02:53] <bot-t> `teh1, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:02:54] <`teh1> the content of #element is being created just before im trying to select it using a jquery plugin
[22:03:23] <`teh1> Cork:  i just pasted the only code im doing (after a plugin creates the contents of the element)
[22:03:38] <coldhead> `teh1: does it work when you run that selector at the consoel?
[22:03:50] <`teh1> literally i am just console.log()ing $('#element') and $('#element tr')
[22:03:55] <Cork> `teh1: how the plugin creates the elements matters too
[22:04:01] <`teh1> append()
[22:04:10] <Cork> and no timer or ajax call?
[22:04:14] <`teh1> nope
[22:04:28] <`teh1> read up @ what i said
[22:04:53] <Cork> only thing i can guess at without seeing the code is that the generated html is invalid
[22:05:00] <Cork> so it isn't added as a child to #element
[22:05:04] <`teh1> i execute both those one after the other and the first one selects the element, but the second doesnt find the child that going through the hierarchy of the #element in the console shows is clearly there
[22:05:16] <`teh1> the html is also visible in the browser
[22:05:27] <`teh1> ok let me make it more clear
[22:05:41] <Cork> `teh1: we can sit here and guess all day
[22:05:45] <`teh1> 1.) the expected table that is generated by a plugin is visible in the browser
[22:05:48] <Cork> what's needed is the code
[22:06:12] <`teh1> 2.) i call console.log($('#element'));, which selects the table's container
[22:06:22] <Forbidd3n> Cork: how would I check if input and/or select are empty when I am looping through $('input, select').each(function(){...});
[22:06:24] <Cork> the code, not a point list
[22:06:25] <`teh1> 3.) gonig through the children in the console reveals that they exist
[22:06:33] <`teh1> there is no code dude -_-
[22:06:33] <coldhead> when i imagine it how you say, `teh1, it works perfectly
[22:06:55] <coldhead> i don't like the font in my imagination's console
[22:06:59] <coldhead> but that's not your problem
[22:07:13] <Cork> Forbidd3n: $('input, select').filter(function() { return !$(this).val(); }).each(function(){...});
[22:07:18] <`teh1> 4.) calling console.log($('#element tr')); selects nothing, according to the console
[22:07:21] <`teh1> simple as that
[22:07:44] <`teh1> 2 lines of code on an elements contents which were generated by a proven working plugin
[22:07:55] <coldhead> console.log(jQuery('#element tr')); ?
[22:08:24] <`teh1> $ is remapped already. it is not complaining that it isnt either
[22:10:02] <`teh1> Cork:  this is the code: https://gist.github.com/teh1ghool/9d6c8abc20d92fc064ce
[22:10:02] <`teh1> :P
[22:10:19] <rbs> i'm getting insane with something, I have 		$('#refresh').click(function() {alert('click');} when I call id from a button it works, but from href it fails
[22:10:34] <rbs> I have <button class="btn" id="refresh">Refresh</button> and <a id="refresh" href="#">Refresh</a>
[22:11:00] <rbs> I already tried to add return false; to the end of the function or event.preventDefault(); on begin, and got the same behavior
[22:11:05] <coldhead> you aren't reusing IDs are you rbs?
[22:11:13] <rbs> yes
[22:11:17] <coldhead> don't do that
[22:11:19] <coldhead> use class instead
[22:11:20] <rbs> nice
[22:11:22] <coldhead> IDs must be unique
[22:11:28] <rbs> my first lesson :D
[22:11:34] <coldhead> it's a good one
[22:11:38] <`teh1> it's a CSS one
[22:11:40] <coldhead> let's always treasure this moment
[22:11:43] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[22:11:43] <rbs> that was my first 2 hours in jQuery sorry for the basic question
[22:11:54] <coldhead> rbs: it's my first day too! <33
[22:13:57] <`teh1> O_O
[22:14:09] <`teh1> $('#element *') doesnt work either, unsurprisingly
[22:15:43] <coldhead> that is QUITE surprising
[22:15:56] <coldhead> what about $('#element').children()
[22:16:15] <Cork> try $('[id="element"]').length
[22:16:34] <`teh1> length=0 coldhead
[22:16:37] <coldhead> who'se a clever cork
[22:17:41] <`teh1> Cork:  same results as using #
[22:17:53] <`teh1> #element works but #element anychildelement doesnt
[22:17:58] <Cork> `teh1: what's the number?
[22:18:01] <Cork>  $('[id="element"]').length <--
[22:18:03] <`teh1> 0
[22:18:05] <`teh1> no
[22:18:07] <`teh1> that is 2
[22:18:12] <Cork> that explains it
[22:18:16] <Cork> you have invalid html
[22:18:18] <`teh1> table and div
[22:18:20] <`teh1> oh
[22:18:21] <`teh1> hang on
[22:18:27] <Cork> you have two elements with the same id
[22:18:36] <`teh1> sorry
[22:18:38] <`teh1> length=1
[22:18:44] <`teh1> i assumed something incorrectly
[22:19:05] <coldhead> story of my life
[22:19:05] <`teh1> i was thinking children
[22:19:07] <Cork> sigh, i'm tired of this guessing game; can you make a demo in jsfiddle?
[22:19:15] <coldhead> he told me it was loaded, why didn't i believe him
[22:19:29] <`teh1> heh
[22:21:53] <`teh1> Cork:  heh same results with jsfiddle‚Ä¶ maybe the plugin is b0rked, but i dont see how
[22:21:55] <`teh1> sec posting
[22:22:28] <`teh1> http://jsfiddle.net/tfGyV/
[22:23:28] <Cork> the plugin is using animate
[22:23:40] <`teh1> omg -_-
[22:23:40] <Cork> that means you get async code flow
[22:23:43] <`teh1> yeh
[22:23:50] <`teh1> i literally realized that at the same time as you
[22:23:50] <`teh1> lol
[22:24:10] <Cork> i did ask about it among the first things i did...
[22:24:20] <`teh1> yep and i forgot that it was animating
[22:24:30] * `teh1 slaps self with a giant frozen salmon
[22:24:46] <Cork> next time post the code direct, it saves us all time
[22:27:44] <NoOova> how jquery works with events?
[22:28:31] <Cork> NoOova: mostly just through the native dom event calls
[22:28:47] <NoOova> it has some publisher-subscribers part that manipulates with JqueryEvents internally in jquery?
[22:28:49] <Cork> it has a compatibility layer ontop, and a feature to allow it to fake events
[22:29:04] <Cork> eh, not really
[22:29:46] <Cork> it has a custom array that is uses to convert events, but jquery can't generate an event the browser doesn't support (except through things like timers)
[22:29:47] <coldhead> wow that would be hella gombligating
[22:29:51] <NoOova> if i do: $('#element').trigger('nonstandartevent') what jquery do?
[22:30:18] <NoOova> create  fake event in compability layer and manimulate with it?
[22:30:21] <Cork> NoOova: it checks it's list of event handlers bound through jquery
[22:30:23] <Cork> and calls them
[22:30:45] <NoOova> ok. but what with bubbling of non-standard events?
[22:30:58] <NoOova> are thay bubbled?
[22:31:00] <Cork> a for loop (kinda)
[22:31:05] <Cork> they might
[22:31:14] <Cork> there is an argument you set to trigger
[22:31:21] <NoOova> it is not fast, as i think?
[22:31:24] <coldhead> NoOova: http://jsfiddle.net/xFZ69/
[22:31:28] <coldhead> play with that
[22:31:35] <Cork> NoOova: why wouldn't it be fast?
[22:31:40] <Cork> it's just looping over an array
[22:32:52] <NoOova> As of jQuery 1.3, .trigger()ed events bubble up the DOM tree;
[22:32:58] <NoOova> ok. bug thanx =)
[22:33:02] <NoOova> big*
[22:33:37] <aaas> is there a problem if I include jquery and jquery mobile on the same site (at the same time)?
[22:33:40] <lenswipee> coldhead: These days do you get a ban when you waste an op's time?
[22:34:17] <coldhead> #jQuery needs more bands
[22:34:20] <coldhead> bans*
[22:34:27] <coldhead> just to keep people on their toes
[22:34:49] <lenswipee> coldhead: Sounds reasonable.
[22:35:15] <coldhead> i can't abide people wasting Cork's time
[22:35:26] <coldhead> if he wasn't around PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME WOULD HAVE TO HELP
[22:35:32] <coldhead> ALL THESE STUPID LITTLE PROBLEMS
[22:35:36] <Cork> O_o
[22:35:38] <coldhead> GOD I WISH EVERYONE WOULD FUCK OFF
[22:35:42] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[22:35:47] <coldhead> that was for ##php
[22:36:06] <Cork> why would you be talking about me on php
[22:36:09] <Cork> :P
[22:36:29] <coldhead> because i'm in love with you, you idiot
[22:36:34] <coldhead> there, i said it
[22:36:46] <coldhead> oops that was supposed to be a PM
[22:37:05] <lenswipee> coldhead: So you don't like the PHP language and the ##PHP
[22:37:05] <Cork> lol
[22:37:32] <coldhead> i love the language
[22:37:38] <coldhead> it's a paradigm of virtue
[22:37:45] <Cork> NoOova: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L286
[22:37:49] <coldhead> clean, simple, efficient, homogenic
[22:39:06] <lenswipee> coldhead: The sarcasm is strong with you.
[22:39:38] <NoOova> Cork: i must see it first, before ask you about events =)
[22:39:39] <coldhead> i don't do sarcasm, i am perfectly sincere
[22:39:43] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[22:39:47] <coldhead> oh wait
[22:40:53] <lenswipee> coldhead: Your words are like a warm breeze over my face, so lovely.
[22:42:35] <coldhead> ew, face grease
[22:57:15] <coldhead> in love with the hook upon which everyone hangs
[22:58:39] <lenswipee> coldhead: You are very poetic.
[22:59:02] <coldhead> i just have a lot of feelings
[22:59:31] <coldhead> this is me: http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbd530nmXl1qmary5o1_500.gif
[23:00:20] <lenswipee> coldhead: lol
[23:01:43] <yedi> is there a way to see if a dom element contains another dom element?
[23:01:55] <yedi> i was using $.contains, but that's not working correctly
[23:01:56] <relipse> is this good syntax: $('#divBugNotes').append('<div id="bugNote_'+ bugnote.id +'" class="bugNote"></div>');
[23:02:14] <Cork> yedi: $('outer-element').find('inner-element').length
[23:02:17] <relipse> because it doesnt seem to be working
[23:02:37] <yedi> can i use a jquery obj as a selector
[23:02:42] <Cork> yes
[23:02:49] <yedi> so $('ele').find($jqobj)
[23:02:51] <yedi> col
[23:02:55] <yedi> cool*, thanks
[23:03:01] <Cork> also you might be able to use has
[23:03:02] <coldhead> relipse: it's nice to use a template engine for things like that
[23:03:04] <Cork> ?.has
[23:03:04] <bot-t> .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[23:03:17] <relipse> coldhead: umm
[23:03:19] <coldhead> relipse: http://www.headspring.com/tim/an-underscore-templates-primer/ or similar
[23:03:23] <Cork> depending on what you need
[23:03:27] <coldhead> avoid having html in your JS
[23:03:55] <lenswipee> relipse: That error are you getting? It looks like you will get parse errors.
[23:04:45] <relipse> i'm not getting parse errors its just not appending any html
[23:04:55] <relipse> coldhead: template engine seems like overkill for this
[23:05:04] <coldhead> fine
[23:05:06] <coldhead> be like that
[23:05:09] <coldhead> i don't care
[23:05:13] * coldhead storms off
[23:06:23] <lenswipee> relipse: explain the last '+'?
[23:06:33] <relipse> $('#divBugNotes').append('<div id="bugNote_'+ bugnote.id +'" class="bugNote"></div>');
[23:06:46] <relipse> what are you talking about?
[23:07:29] <lenswipee> relipse: Nothing. I'm new to jQuery, so I got confused, so sorry,
[23:09:29] <relipse> why isn't this code working: https://pastee.org/jye56
[23:10:02] <coldhead> relipse: http://jsfiddle.net/p37xX/
[23:10:12] <Cork> ?.append @ relipse
[23:10:13] <bot-t> relipse, .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[23:12:00] <Cork> relipse: also i would use $('#divBugNotes').append($('<div/>').attr('id', bugnote.id).addClass('bugNote').html(bugnote.memo));
[23:12:16] <relipse> yeah its not working on my page
[23:12:27] <relipse> cork: oh cool yeah i wanted to do that
[23:13:53] <relipse> hmm its not working,
[23:14:11] <Cork> then something outside it is broken
[23:14:16] <relipse> oh i found it
[23:14:24] <relipse> the old <div id="#myid" problem
[23:14:33] <relipse> thanks
[23:15:36] <coldhead> relipse: http://jsfiddle.net/p37xX/1/
[23:15:46] <coldhead> that's how i'd do it if i wasn't afraid of templating
[23:15:52] <coldhead> er, if i was*
[23:16:15] <relipse> thats cool
[23:16:22] <relipse> what about cork's idea
[23:16:29] <relipse> .attr('id',....
[23:16:43] <coldhead> yeah that's for lovers
[23:16:47] <Cork> relipse: those two are basically the same thing
[23:16:59] <Cork> coldhead: choosed to use the short form for it though
[23:17:13] <coldhead> oops i forgot the important bit
[23:17:15] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/p37xX/2/
[23:17:17] <Cork> (i'm not a fan of that format, but thats all)
[23:17:20] <coldhead> append() instead of html()
[23:17:39] <coldhead> Cork's way is slower :P
[23:17:43] <Cork> coldhead: you could compress all that into a short line
[23:17:49] <Cork> coldhead: not really
[23:17:56] <coldhead> at the expense of readability!
[23:17:58] <Cork> both run the same functions
[23:18:25] <Cork> with the exception of addClass
[23:18:33] <coldhead> i bet if i overwrote $.fn.attr() mine would still work
[23:18:37] <coldhead> based on 0 research
[23:18:41] <coldhead> and a vague hope
[23:19:53] <albino> Is it possible with JS or jquery to detect that the script itself was loaded via a 302 redirect?  In other words <script src="foo.js"></script> foo.js would be an http 302 redirect to another js file
[23:20:28] <Cork> coldhead: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L115
[23:20:58] <coldhead> yes well cork, YOU CAN PROVE ANYTHING WITH FACTS
[23:21:05] <Cork> ^^'
[23:21:21] <coldhead> well proven though
[23:21:48] <coldhead> i don't think so, albino
[23:21:49] <Cork> man the jquery repo is hard to search in cause of the extrem file splits
[23:21:50] <coldhead> not after the fact
[23:22:13] <coldhead> Cork: isn't there an unminified single file version in there somewher?
[23:22:21] <coldhead> or maybe that's only when you build it
[23:22:23] <Cork> not in the repo no
[23:22:29] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery
[23:22:33] <Cork> as you run make to generate the final jquery lib
[23:22:42] <Cork> and then minify it after that
[23:23:40] <coldhead> i am not going to be doing that any time soon
[23:24:02] <Cork> the build dependencies is extream
[23:24:20] <Cork> it depends on node.js among other things
[23:24:30] <coldhead> and a million npm packages
[23:25:02] <Cork> i've actually built it from source once, and... it wasn't fun...
[23:27:26] <coldhead> well, different strokes for different folks, right?
[23:27:39] <coldhead> people like weird stuff
[23:27:52] <coldhead> i like pregnant women in striped dresses and butterflies
[23:28:02] <relipse> are you homosexual?
[23:28:08] <Cork> O_o
[23:28:13] <coldhead> >: |
[23:34:58] <coldhead> that poor old nag
[23:35:32] <sacho_> actual build depedencies or just that the build tools need node.js
[23:35:54] <Cork> sacho_: it's not just node.js
[23:36:20] <Cork> it pulls in submodules that depends on a long list of packages (forgotten many of there names)
[23:36:28] <Cork> and the tests depend on quint
[23:36:47] <sacho_> yeah, that's all normal for big js projects
[23:36:50] <Cork> i have a vage memory that it also needed java; but don't quote me on that
[23:37:28] <sacho_> There's no default build tools package, so you need to fetch them all yourself
[23:40:54] <coldhead> no one ever really needs to build it themselves anyway
[23:41:08] <Error404NotFound> How would i get an element if i have path of that element stored inside a string? Say i have elementPath="$('#list-viewPortletView').parent().find('.summary') "; eval?
[23:41:49] <Cork> ya, though you shouldn't be doing that to begin with
[23:41:55] <Cork> send a function instead
[23:42:40] <Cork> var elementPath = function(target) { return $(target).parent().find('summary'); }; var matches = elementPath.call(target);
[23:42:49] <Cork> opps
[23:42:57] <Cork> var elementPath = function() { return $(this).parent().find('summary'); }; var matches = elementPath.call(target);
[23:43:02] <coldhead> voodoo
[23:44:00] <Error404NotFound> Cork: ok, i have to admit thats cool. I know its possible but i was going with my own lame version :P
[23:44:28] <vladikoff> can anyone see this guy's nick?, it's returning 404 for me...
[23:44:33] <Cork> Error404NotFound: eval is evil, it's not just cause it rims
[23:44:59] <Cork> Error404NotFound: you get all kind of horrible problems from it, so it's better to do it in a static way
[23:45:07] <le_gars> Hello! A question about chaining. How would you do it with something like this? $dialog = $("#" + id); $dialog.find("h4").text(title) $dialog.find("p").text(body) $dialog.show();
[23:45:42] <Cork> le_gars: i would do it exactly as you did it
[23:45:46] <Error404NotFound> Cork: ya, i, myself, have to close my right eye when i am writing eval.
[23:46:20] <Cork> le_gars: but if you REALLY want to chain it you can do end()
[23:46:42] <Cork> Error404NotFound: csp helps :)
[23:46:49] <le_gars> Really but would it not be better like loosing the $dialog var and just join with .
[23:46:54] <Cork> script-src: 'self'
[23:47:01] <Cork> then you CAN'T use eval :D
[23:47:21] <le_gars> end()?
[23:47:29] <le_gars> never heard of
[23:47:33] <Cork> le_gars: the functions return self, so you are basically still using $dialog
[23:47:39] <coldhead> lol flod
[23:47:42] <Cork> so no, it's no performance gain what so ever
[23:47:44] <Cork> ?.end
[23:47:44] <bot-t> .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[23:48:22] <le_gars> ok cool thanks!
[23:48:25] <Cork> and i think .end() makes the code harder to read
[23:48:38] <le_gars> ok good point.
[23:49:23] <le_gars> but for every find I do without joining with the . arent I returning a jquery object?
[23:49:33] <Cork> yes
[23:49:41] <Cork> but so is .end() too
[23:50:01] <Qdest> Hey Cork! If I create a var footer = document.createElement("footer"); how come I cant do footer.addClass('myClass'); ?
[23:50:05] <Cork> it's all just variables, not much difference there
[23:50:24] <Cork> Qdest: $(footer).addClass()
[23:50:39] <Cork> you're working on dom not jquery if you use document.createElement
[23:50:54] <Cork> you could also do $('<footer/>').addClass('myClass');
[23:50:59] <Qdest> oh, ofc. Thanks!
[23:51:01] <Cork> and have it all in one go
[23:51:16] <Qdest> Have it all in one go?
[23:51:31] <Cork> create the footer element and set the class
[23:51:41] <Cork> var footer = $('<footer/>').addClass('myClass');
[23:51:45] <Qdest> So, basically if I am to append if after .fan, I'd do $('<footer/>').addClass('myClass').append('.fan'); ?
[23:51:47] <le_gars> Ok, thank you Cork:
[23:52:05] <Cork> Qdest: yes that would work
[23:52:16] <Cork> except the append content
[23:52:48] <Cork> Qdest: append needs to be either a dom element (or wrapped) or an html string
[23:52:59] <Cork> it can't be a selector
[23:53:19] <Qdest> so append($('.fan')) o.O
[23:53:25] <Cork> yes
[23:53:32] <Cork> or you can use wrap
[23:53:34] <Cork> ?.wrap
[23:53:35] <bot-t> .wrap(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[23:54:01] <Qdest> well, I want this footer to be a sibling of .fan
[23:54:24] <Cork> oh, then you don't want append
[23:54:26] <Cork> you want after
[23:54:33] <Cork> or even insertAfter
[23:54:43] <Cork> ?insertAfter
[23:54:43] <bot-t> .insertAfter(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[23:54:58] <marandi> hi guys , i use this code to change input text border line , but it wont work , help please ($('input[type="text"]').css("border" , "solid 1px #00ff00");)
[23:55:14] <Qdest> Thanks a lot Cork for clarifying!
[23:55:29] <Cork> marandi: why arn't you just using a class?
[23:55:57] <Cork> css belongs in the css file, not in the js file
[23:55:57] <marandi> Cork: i tried that too , $('input[type="text"]').addClass("usernameDone");
[23:56:19] <Cork> what is $('input[type="text"]').length ?
[23:56:39] <Error404NotFound> Cork: from earlier: wouldn't would have to set elementPath.call to that function?
[23:57:17] <marandi> Cork: 15
[23:57:48] <Cork> marandi: and if you inspect the dom after running the code is the class on the elements?
[23:58:07] <Qdest> Cork, if I want to add things to the new <footer>-element created and insertedAfter .fan; how would I create a <ul> and then in that <ul> create li*X ? What I mean is, how can I select the newly created footer and append (sorry, I meant insert) in it?
[23:58:12] <marandi> Cork: let me check
[23:58:47] <unstable> I just switched from zepto to jqm because I want to use some bounce animation. I'm just adding the document on page init stuff.. though I can't get a simple alert to occur on page init. https://github.com/JohnTheodore/taco_maps/blob/master/index.html
[23:59:06] <Cork> ?eval function test(callback) { return callback.call(2); } }; test(function() { return this * 2; }); @ Error404NotFound
[23:59:09] <bot-t> Error404NotFound: SyntaxError: syntax error
[23:59:12] <Cork> bah
[23:59:21] <Cork> ?eval function test(callback) { return callback.call(2); }; test(function() { return this * 2; }); @ Error404NotFound
[23:59:21] <bot-t> Error404NotFound: 4
[23:59:37] <Cork> Error404NotFound: that is somewhat how it would look
[23:59:38] <marandi> Cork: nah , in some inputes i have validate class , but my class didnt add !
