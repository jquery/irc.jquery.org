[02:10:20] <Ritzton> Hello
[02:11:25] <Ritzton> I am using Jquery Mobile, I have set up automatic back button on my app with "$.mobile.page.prototype.options.addBackBtn = true;" but it doesnt work when I post a form, any issues please ?
[02:12:44] <thinkerweb> Ritzton, there is a much easier way
[02:13:16] <thinkerweb> Ritzton, data-rel="back", I guess you already know that eh
[02:14:09] <Ritzton> ?
[02:14:35] <thinkerweb> Ritzton, yeah, that's the way you do it
[02:14:47] <Ritzton> the problem is after posting the form, the back button doesnt link at al
[02:15:49] <thinkerweb> Ritzton, yeah, AJAX, so you should probably link to the file instead.  The form gets posted via ajax, so the page doesn't move ahead I guess, not sure
[02:17:26] <Ritzton> no, it isnt a ajax post, it is a normal post
[02:17:54] <Ritzton> maybe an ajax post will sold my problem as the page will not change
[02:18:45] <thinkerweb> Ritzton, no, what I mean is, jquery mobile posts forms via ajax automatically, if you want, you can disable that using data-ajax="false", but ajax is a good idea on mobile cause of slow data
[02:21:52] <thinkerweb> I made a link to a file and specified "dialog", and I expect the link to be an autoenhanced button, and the dialog link page to be autoenhanced into a dialog page, and it DOES work on my local server, but on the internet it doesn't.  Also, if I copy the site to my phone, it works if I load it via url file:///... but not if I navigate to the page and click it and it opens it in a viewer.  The link isn't autoenhanced always, sometimes I j
[02:21:52] <thinkerweb> ust see a regular link and linked to a regular page instead of dialog page
[02:22:12] <Gavilan2> shoky: Thanks!
[02:22:29] <Gavilan2> Hey! When I get a dblclick, I also get a click. any way to prevent that?
[02:24:37] <Ritzton> thinkerweb ? How disabling ajax will help me ? I would like to know how to deal with the back button for self-submitting Forms
[02:26:04] <thinkerweb> Ritzton, when you self submit the form, it gets submitted via ajax, thats all I know, I think the history gets updated so back button should work a far as I know, but if you disable ajax, it will definitely work
[02:28:54] <Ritzton> ?
[02:29:19] <Ritzton> I dont understand your sentence, you are saying the back button should work in both case ?
[02:31:23] <thinkerweb> Ritzton, yep
[02:31:38] <thinkerweb> Ritzton, do you know that everything happens by ajax automatically?
[02:33:06] <Ritzton> yeah but when I disable ajax for the forms, after form submitting, there is no back button at all
[02:33:33] <Ritzton> and when I dont disable ajax, the back button is there but the user has to press twice the back button to be back
[02:34:08] <thinkerweb> http://localhost/mobi-pg-slides/jquery.mobile-1.2.0/demos/docs/pages/page-navmodel.html
[02:34:29] <thinkerweb> docs/pages/page-navmodel.html
[02:36:01] <thinkerweb> Ritzton, I think most applications fail if users click back button for form submitting. I recall seeing "do not use browsers back button" on many web form apps
[02:37:57] <Ritzton> yeah but what you be interesting is if I could link the back button to a page, I mean if I write the address of the page to link
[02:42:44] <Ritzton> I am kind of lost, I dont know what to do to deal with this back button...

[07:13:54] <NeedSomeHelp> hello, how can i loop through all "messages" in this json ? http://jsfiddle.net/NmdXy/
[07:14:58] <johnkpaul> NeedSomeHelp: messages isn't an array
[07:15:00] <johnkpaul> there's only one
[07:15:39] <NeedSomeHelp> yes in this case theres only one, in other cases there may be multiple.
[07:15:58] <NeedSomeHelp> Still it should be able to loop through them even if its only 1 item
[07:16:11] <johnkpaul> NeedSomeHelp: then it should be an array
[07:16:12] <johnkpaul> not an object
[07:16:23] <johnkpaul> {"messages":[]} not {"messages":{}}
[07:16:42] <johnkpaul> {"messages":[{"name":"wahtever"}, {"name":"whateverelse}]}
[07:17:45] <NeedSomeHelp> hmm.. okay. Will try to change the json output then
[07:18:31] <johnkpaul> NeedSomeHelp: once that's an array, you can use $.each(response.messages, function(index, message){//message.name})
[07:29:29] <daveace> when you use json to grab a query from php
[07:29:44] <daveace> is there a way i can put it all in a hash?
[07:29:57] <daveace> infact nm
[07:38:13] <NeedSomeHelp> johnkpaul: http://jsfiddle.net/NmdXy/1/
[07:39:19] <johnkpaul> NeedSomeHelp: that seems to work fine for me http://jsfiddle.net/NmdXy/2/
[07:41:39] <StephenS> Jel neko svira harmoniku ili slusa narodne pesme??
[07:53:05] <NeedSomeHelp> johnkpaul: yes your example works fine. I just discovered that the PHP which generates the JSON, actually writes it as "[\"The name field is required.\",\"The info field is required.\"]". So perhaps it has to do with the added backslashes?
[07:54:54] <NeedSomeHelp> no, it doesnt seem so
[07:55:51] <NeedSomeHelp> But it works when hard coding the json, not when using var response = $.parseJSON(xhr.responseText); for some reason
[08:07:57] <NeedSomeHelp> Hello can anybody explain this? I am trying to loop through a json string. Compare code 1 and 2: http://jsfiddle.net/NmdXy/4/

[08:30:06] <ryanneufeld> daveace: how is that not a PHP question?
[08:30:24] <daveace> because it's nothing to do with getting a query
[08:30:33] <daveace> i have got the query
[08:30:36] <ryanneufeld> daveace: then why did you say that?
[08:30:37] <daveace> i have got it into jquery
[08:30:42] <daveace> because that's what im returning
[08:30:48] <ryanneufeld> ?jsisjs @NeedSomeHelp
[08:30:49] <bot-t> NeedSomeHelp, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[08:30:54] <daveace> using json, i've got the array
[08:31:07] <daveace> of all my data from my mysql data base from php into jquery
[08:31:58] <NeedSomeHelp> ryanneufeld: what was that reply for? didnt see any relevance to my question
[08:32:00] <daveace> what's the bet they say ask in jquery
[08:32:09] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: see ?ajax101
[08:32:10] <bot-t> NeedSomeHelp, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[08:33:05] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: looking at your code, it seems that you're not understanding how ajax works.
[08:33:44] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: also, if you're using jquery to fetch json, you get an object as your result data
[08:33:56] <NeedSomeHelp> ryanneufeld: please explain what I have missed. So much more useful than sending me plenty of ajax tutorials
[08:33:58] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: so you can just access it like a regular object.
[08:34:38] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: reading the tutorials is a start. If you don't understand the concepts, you're going to get frustrated
[08:35:43] <ryanneufeld> daveace: so then you have used json_encode on your PHP result set
[08:35:48] <NeedSomeHelp> ryanneufeld: do you see why the first code works fine while the second does not? Notice that response variable contains exactly the same in both codes.
[08:36:14] <daveace> yes, and i've got it via ajax in my and print the value to a div
[08:36:42] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: yes, I do, it's because you're doing it wrong.  You have to use a callback to process data from an XHR
[08:36:46] <daveace> is there anyway of putting it into a hash of a hash then i can just go through the hash
[08:36:56] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: read the tutorials, none of them do it the way you are.
[08:37:07] <daveace>  {"ID":"1", "type":something} {"ID":"2", "type":somethingelse}  << that's an example of the result it puts in the div
[08:37:33] <ryanneufeld> daveace: okay, javascript has for ( key in thing )
[08:37:40] <ryanneufeld> which is similar to php's foreach
[08:38:17] <daveace> the problem is though, my ids are labelled in order.. but they arent 1 2 3 but like 1 5 6 8 9
[08:38:35] <ryanneufeld> and?
[08:38:49] <ryanneufeld> for in will do that

[08:39:17] <ryanneufeld> daveace: checkout the example that illustrates the hasOwnProperty
[08:39:56] <ryanneufeld> daveace: also, when I'm debugging stuff, I usually do a console.log(data)
[08:40:06] <ryanneufeld> where data is the object

[09:29:38] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: you don't need to use parseJSON
[09:29:49] <ryanneufeld> you can use dataType: 'json'
[09:30:01] <ryanneufeld> in your ajax call, and then the data will be an object

[09:36:06] <ryanneufeld> ah
[09:38:09] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: it looks like you're trying to use the ajax error handler to display some errors for the user
[09:38:20] <ryanneufeld> if so, that's not what that callback is for
[09:38:30] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, i don't understand
[09:38:44] <ryanneufeld> the error callback is for when there is an error (non http 200) response from the server

[09:40:26] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: well, text() is not a method of string
[09:41:33] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, is there any alternative
[09:41:55] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: why are you doing it that way?
[09:42:11] <ryanneufeld> is that just a sample you wrote to illustrate your problem?
[09:42:20] <ryanneufeld> are you using jquery at all?
[09:42:59] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: I think you should start here: http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/
[09:43:13] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, i used that because : anch.innerHTML gave me underfined
[09:43:27] <NeedSomeHelp> ryanneufeld: I tried to add dataType: 'json', and remove $.parseJSON, but it will wont loop through the items in response
[09:43:48] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: are you using the ajax error callback to handle form validation errors?
[09:43:58] <NeedSomeHelp> yes
[09:44:03] <ryanneufeld> stop it
[09:44:09] <ryanneufeld> that is not what that is for

[09:47:54] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: the error handler that you're using, is for errors in ajax request. So if your server responds with something that your js doesn't know how to handle, or a non 200 http status code

[09:49:20] <ryanneufeld> where does anch come from?
[09:49:35] <NeedSomeHelp> ryanneufeld: okay, so I should send both form validation ok and form validation error back to ajax success callback function?
[09:50:10] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, changed it to something simple... Why does that matter?
[09:50:16] <Krambiorix> you're missing my point
[09:50:19] <NeedSomeHelp> ryanneufeld, I tried your code, but there was no diff in result.
[09:50:52] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: what did the console say?
[09:51:03] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: what does console.log(typeof anch.subject) say?
[09:51:52] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: also, you're the one missing the point here. There are several datatypes in javascript. If i don't know what anch is, or what created it. I can't help you.
[09:52:23] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, string
[09:52:30] <Krambiorix> ok i understand
[09:52:36] <ryanneufeld> you get it now?
[09:52:41] <Krambiorix> yes
[09:52:47] <Krambiorix> can i make an object of it?
[09:52:52] <ryanneufeld> it already is
[09:53:08] <ryanneufeld> strings are objects
[09:53:10] <Krambiorix> yes , but a string
[09:53:18] <Krambiorix> an anchor object i mean
[09:53:19] <ryanneufeld> what do you want it to be?
[09:53:35] <ryanneufeld> yes, I imagine you could
[09:53:56] <ryanneufeld> if you wanted to do it with jquery: $(anch.subject) would do it
[09:53:58] <NeedSomeHelp> ryanneufeld: error message at the bottom here: http://jsfiddle.net/NmdXy/9/. The 500 error is thrown by the form validator.
[09:54:28] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: The server responded with a 500 error
[09:55:04] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: so check your server code that is at site_url+'item/add'
[09:55:21] <Krambiorix> ryanneufeld, thank you, that works
[09:55:30] <ryanneufeld> Krambiorix: np
[09:56:10] <NeedSomeHelp> ryanneufeld: I have thrown a 500 error on purpose when the form validation fails. The server output from that is simply: "[\"The name field is required.\",\"The info field is required.\"]"
[09:57:17] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: that's not valid json
[09:57:21] <ryanneufeld> not even close
[09:57:37] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: are you using PHP on the back end?
[09:57:42] <NeedSomeHelp> yes
[09:57:54] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: json_encode(array/object/thing)
[09:58:00] <ryanneufeld> will return valid json
[09:58:06] <ryanneufeld> also, don't use 500 for that
[09:58:11] <NeedSomeHelp> already using json_encode
[09:58:18] <ryanneufeld> 500 server error means there is something wrong with your server
[09:58:24] <ryanneufeld> which is not the case
[09:58:30] <ryanneufeld> your server is working fine
[09:58:42] <NeedSomeHelp> okay, so I should also add form validation error to ajax success callback function?
[09:59:17] <ryanneufeld> here is an example of how we handle that http://www.metrolyrics.com/api/v1/search/lyrics/find/welcome%20to%20the%20jungle/
[09:59:43] <ryanneufeld> http://www.metrolyrics.com/api/v1/search/lyrics/find/welcome%20to%20the%20jungle/format/php
[09:59:50] <ryanneufeld> that's the array that get's json encoded
[09:59:53] <NeedSomeHelp> yep
[10:00:12] <ryanneufeld> what does your array look like before you json encode it?
[10:02:27] <NeedSomeHelp> array(0=>'The name field is required.', 1=>'The info field is required.')
[10:03:34] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: oh, okay, so that would just come out as a normal array then
[10:03:38] <ryanneufeld> that makes sense
[10:04:31] <ryanneufeld> you shouldn't have to use parseJSON either way
[10:04:47] <ryanneufeld> also, you can help jquery get it right by setting your headers in php
[10:06:04] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: header('Content-type: application/json');
[10:07:44] <NeedSomeHelp> ok, let me fix this. Back in a few minutes.
[10:17:36] <NeedSomeHelp> With the following JSON, how do I check if it contains errors? {"attributes":{"category_id":"1","_":"1361124985736"},"errors":{"messages":{"name":["The name field is required."],"info":["The info field is required."]},"format":":message"}}
[10:17:45] <NeedSomeHelp> I tried if(data.hasOwnProperty('errors'))
[10:18:05] <ryanneufeld> data.errors
[10:18:11] <ryanneufeld> if( data.errors )
[10:18:49] <ryanneufeld> looks like each of your messages is an array though
[10:18:55] <ryanneufeld> is that intended?
[10:19:35] <NeedSomeHelp> alert(data.errors): undefined
[10:20:20] <guy> does jquery have any optimisations that could be the cause for the behaviour, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14924322/how-to-translate-element-position-from-x1-to-x2-using-transitions
[10:20:26] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: console.log(data)
[10:20:35] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: that will tell you what your data looks like
[10:20:36] <NeedSomeHelp> yes probably. I use Laravel php framework
[10:21:23] <NeedSomeHelp> that outputs the json
[10:21:42] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: do a console.log(data)
[10:21:53] <ryanneufeld> in chrome that will give you the object
[10:22:09] <ryanneufeld> and you can expand it and see it's structure
[10:22:18] <ryanneufeld> then you can use that to find what you need in it.
[10:22:27] <NeedSomeHelp> yes, it gives: {"attributes":{"category_id":"1","_":"1361125331444"},"errors":{"messages":{"name":["The name field is required."],"info":["The info field is required."]},"format":":message"}}
[10:23:02] <NeedSomeHelp> I need to check if the errors key exists in it (which it does in this case)
[10:23:25] <ryanneufeld> what browser?
[10:24:26] <NeedSomeHelp> chrome
[10:24:30] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: http://cl.ly/image/233C0s050O2U
[10:24:45] <ryanneufeld> and your datatype is set to 'json' ?
[10:25:13] <scroat> moin.
[10:25:23] <scroat> how can I get the current css "cursor" property?
[10:25:35] <ryanneufeld> ?css @ scroat
[10:25:36] <bot-t> scroat, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[10:25:52] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: http://cl.ly/image/343f1L2r2a3n
[10:25:54] <scroat> I thought .css() sets it.
[10:26:02] <NeedSomeHelp> ryanneufeld: yes, still set to 'json'
[10:26:03] <scroat> is it overloaded by the number of parameters ?
[10:26:27] <ryanneufeld> scroat: many of the functions of the jquery object are getters and setters
[10:26:38] <scroat> yup.
[10:26:46] <scroat> didn't know css() was overloaded.
[10:26:47] <ryanneufeld> scroat: reading the docs can help remove the confustion
[10:28:54] <discorpia> scroat: basically all getters are overloaded with a set-method by adding an extra argument, .text(),.html(),.val(),.css(),.attr(),.data() etc

[10:34:02] <techgig> how to join java channel??
[10:34:13] <ryanneufeld>  /join
[10:34:36] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: don't use alerts
[10:34:41] <techgig> itz saying like u must be invited..
[10:34:46] <gusti> .java
[10:35:21] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: alerts are blocking. So they can cause you false results when testing. Use console.log instead
[10:36:05] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: your code says "If there are errors, do  the successful thing. But if it all went okay, then tell them they have an error"
[10:36:17] <techgig> anyone know Java here?
[10:36:27] <ryanneufeld> techgig: try ##java
[10:36:35] <ryanneufeld> This channel is for jquery
[10:36:45] <techgig> I have tried tht too

[10:38:18] <ryanneufeld> if you have an interest in learning jquery you're welcome to hang out
[10:44:45] <NeedSomeHelp> ryanneufeld: data.errors=undefined, always
[10:45:44] <NeedSomeHelp> http://jsfiddle.net/NmdXy/12/
[10:46:09] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/NmdXy/11/
[10:46:11] <ryanneufeld> do it that way
[10:47:23] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: other wise you'll have to do if( typeof data.errors !== 'undefined' )
[10:47:31] <ryanneufeld> but the way I suggested is better
[10:49:49] <NeedSomeHelp> i think form validation ok and error are mixed up in your paste
[10:51:41] <NeedSomeHelp> data.errors is always false
[10:55:59] <NeedSomeHelp> wait
[11:11:41] <ryanneufeld> NeedSomeHelp: no, i'm pretty certain I got it right :)
[11:18:59] <Lucky--> they should rename windows, to microsoft window as of windows8
[11:19:19] <hXm> they should stop codding.
[11:20:31] <Lucky--> hXm: nah, thats #php
[11:20:41] <hXm> ah
[11:20:44] <Lucky--> hell that aint even coding, more like 'scripting'
[11:20:58] <ryanneufeld> Lucky--: really?
[11:21:05] <ryanneufeld> cause php has objects, and classes
[11:21:10] <Lucky--> yes, php is a runtime interpreted language
[11:21:12] <ryanneufeld> and interfaces
[11:21:16] <ryanneufeld> so is javascript
[11:21:18] <Lucky--> so does javascript
[11:21:27] <Lucky--> see but javascript is a scripting language
[11:21:35] <ryanneufeld> ?g define: programming
[11:21:35] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: Computer programming - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming
[11:21:36] <hXm> they scripting if you take as copy&paste from krugle.org as invent code.
[11:21:36] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, No results found for 'define: programming'.
[11:21:54] <Lucky--> and makes no false representations to be anything other then what it is
[11:22:11] <ryanneufeld> "Provide (a computer or other machine) with coded instructions for the automatic performance of a particular task."
[11:22:19] <ryanneufeld> That is what programming is
[11:22:34] <ryanneufeld> so a script, or a compiled application is the same thing
[11:22:50] <Lucky--> not at all
[11:23:02] <Lucky--> they are both different forms of programming
[11:23:08] <ryanneufeld> and java?
[11:23:15] <Lucky--> a joke
[11:23:29] <Lucky--> security flaws anyone?
[11:23:37] <hXm> me
[11:23:44] <ryanneufeld> Lucky--: that's a BS answer
[11:23:46] <hXm> and once i got scared reading securityfocus
[11:23:54] <Lucky--> bugtraq ftw
[11:24:07] <Lucky--> portability doesnt mean throw a ginormous vm in front of your app
[11:24:07] <ryanneufeld> Lucky--: what would you consider java?
[11:24:13] <ryanneufeld> it has a VM
[11:24:13] <Lucky--> its a programming language
[11:24:22] <simonwebsite> Bonjour à tous! J'ai un soucis en jquery. Y'a-t-il des gens succeptible de pouvoir m'aider svp ?
[11:24:24] <ryanneufeld> and it's compiled at run time
[11:24:37] <ryanneufeld> simonwebsite: English in her please
[11:24:39] <ryanneufeld> *here
[11:24:43] <ryanneufeld> whoops :S
[11:24:58] <simonwebsite> Are you french in room ?
[11:25:18] <ryanneufeld> Lucky--: by your own definition java would be scripting since it's run-time interpreted
[11:25:36] <ryanneufeld> but yet you contradict yourself by calling it a programming language
[11:26:04] <ryanneufeld> Also, since Facebook released hiphop, php can be compiled into binaries
[11:26:15] <ryanneufeld> so does that then change your defninition?
[11:26:19] <Lucky--> no, it gets compiled to c++ which then gets compiled into bytecode
[11:26:31] <Lucky--> meaning its no longer php
[11:26:57] <ryanneufeld> and you haven't addressed my question about java?
[11:28:12] <Pal-JQ> Hi friends.... i need yours help.....i have a thought about ------ consider i have one div and divided into 10 row 10 cols and i putted some dots randomly . Now using animation or anything i wanna find which row having highest dots......Can any one help me please
[11:28:37] <ryanneufeld> simonwebsite: J'ai utilisé Google Translate pour cela. Cette chambre est principalement anglophone.
[11:28:41] <Pal-JQ> bassically wanna scan the div
[11:28:48] <ryanneufeld> Lucky--: ?
[11:29:49] <Pal-JQ> Is this my question is correct and any possible way to achieve my problem
[11:29:52] <ryanneufeld> Pal-JQ: you'd have to iterate over them
[11:30:18] <ryanneufeld> Pal-JQ: see ?$.each
[11:30:20] <bot-t> Pal-JQ, .each() | jQuery API Documentation - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[11:34:18] <Pal-JQ> each() is good idea... because 100 times want to iterate ....is there no performance issue??????
[11:35:00] <ryanneufeld> Pal-JQ: there is no other way to do it
[11:35:04] <ryanneufeld> you have to iterate
[11:36:59] <Pal-JQ> i had a idea about animation.....like scanning the div using animation.........but i am not sure how well to achieve or it's possible also
[11:37:00] <Pal-JQ> ????
[11:37:27] <Pal-JQ> just thinking thinking .............
[11:37:29] <ryanneufeld> Pal-JQ: animation is for animating things. making them move, or transform in some way
[11:37:59] <ryanneufeld> it would not be appropriate to use those
[11:38:08] <Pal-JQ> Ok fine
[11:38:39] <djQuery> how can I put a callback in one of my functions ?    function doWork(table, data, callback){  callback('it worked') });
[11:38:56] <djQuery> ??
[11:39:04] <shoky> like that
[11:39:10] <shoky> unless you mean something else by 'put'
[11:40:44] <djQuery> shoky, nope    so just calling it is    var data={}, table = 'test'; doWork(table, data, function(r){do something here});   right?
[11:41:24] <shoky> yup
[11:43:48] <Robr3rd> Using $.ajax(), is it possible to refresh a <div> on success? I know it is common practice to simply set the <div>'s inner html to the response text, but in my case it would be much more maintainable if I could merely refresh *just* the <div> on the page.
[11:45:13] <shoky> Robr3rd: there's no such thing as refreshing a div, other than setting its html..or styling it
[11:45:15] <ryanneufeld> Robr3rd: I don't see the difference between the two thing syours asking
[11:45:43] <ryanneufeld> Robr3rd: replacing the innerHTML would be 'refreshing' it
[11:45:52] <shoky> "refresh" applies to webpages, not DOM elements
[11:46:11] <Xtrivity> Hey guys. If I have a one page site www.thegamewhat.com where all of the links <a href=""> are all just links to execute JS, google has issues indexing the site due to no sitemap. It says it errors out because the links dont go anywhere. What's the easeist way to solve this problem?
[11:48:19] <Robr3rd> The situation is that this <div> is dynamically filled by a server-side script. The current solution is to submit the div, then in the processing file repeat a bunch of code that gets run on page load anyway just to have it returned without a full page refresh. I would rather not have duplicate code if at all possible when the <div> is already programmed to sort itself out onpageload
[11:49:19] <Robr3rd> If something like that isn't possible though (and I haven't heard of it either, thus why I'm asking here), then that's fine. It was just a question that Google couldn't answer. ;)
[11:49:54] <shoky> Robr3rd: sounds like your problem is the server code.. why do you need to run code that already ran on page load, if you .. dont need it
[11:50:52] <Robr3rd> shoky: Because it involves database-driven if/else statements that decide how to display certain things in the div.
[11:51:36] <shoky> either its needed or it isnt.. if it is, then i dont understand the prob
[11:52:21] <shoky> maybe i misread you, nevermind
[11:53:54] <carl_> Does anyone know the best way of passing data from a jquery function to my angular scope (in the same page)
[11:57:18] <discorpia> carl_: mayeb a globally defined object to use as namespace/registry
[11:57:19] <raj> how can I figure out what's causing zoom:1 too show up on my body?
[11:58:25] <shoky> maybe it's a birthmark
[11:59:02] <shoky> or.. stop drinking so much
[11:59:43] <grafi> brilliant
[12:01:08] <carl_> discorpia, would there be anyway to call an jquery function through angular?\
[12:07:13] <Tcalp> hey guys, looking to setup a basic div/content rotator for testimonial excerpts in a sidebar window ... I don't want to use some bulky slider script .. any suggestions ?
[12:09:03] <happyface> Tcalp, if you don't want bulk sometimes the best thing is to write it yourself
[12:10:33] <Tcalp> heh, just found this
[12:10:34] <Tcalp> http://www.rmcwill.com/2011/08/simple-jquery-text-rotator/
[12:10:43] <Tcalp> sounds like it will likely do the trick
[12:11:30] <NeedSomeHelp> How do I count the number of messages in this object (which is 2 in this case)? http://jsfiddle.net/J4CUy/
[12:12:12] <raj> does jquery 1.9 add zoom:1 to the body?
[12:12:18] <raj> cuz that's what it's doing
[12:14:29] <raj> yes it does
[12:14:30] <raj> but why
[12:32:46] <shoky> raj: its cause of some old IE issue
[12:44:17] <raj> shoky, but it's applied to all browsers anyway?
[12:44:40] <raj> isn't that messy?
[13:10:06] <carl_> What is the easiest way to pass some data from a jquery function to my angular scope?
[13:11:55] <shoky> raj: yeap ;]
[13:37:46] <NeedSomeHelp> Hello. With this code, is it possible to add more variables to data? http://jsfiddle.net/2t6EQ/
[13:37:59] <sekyms> If I'm passing an array to jQuery with PHP should I be encoding each string in the array with jsonencode or the array after I'm done making it?
[13:38:46] <muffinrecon> if I were you I'd probably encode it before you make it
[13:39:02] <sekyms> so each string...
[13:39:08] <muffinrecon> sekyms what type of data?
[13:39:12] <muffinrecon> data for the db?
[13:39:15] <sekyms> yeah
[13:39:18] <sekyms> mysqql
[13:39:22] <muffinrecon> def encode it
[13:39:27] <muffinrecon> and set up some type of validation
[13:39:28] <sekyms> people enter "'" and it breaks
[13:39:35] <sekyms> encode it client side?
[13:39:39] <sekyms> on the way to the db?
[13:39:43] <muffinrecon> client
[13:40:01] <muffinrecon> and that won't stop the other sql injections btw
[13:40:21] <muffinrecon> also do like a php serverside check too
[13:40:29] <muffinrecon> incase they manage to get past the first client side one
[13:40:34] <sekyms> to make sure theres no funny business going on?
[13:40:38] <muffinrecon> yeah
[13:41:09] <Bankzilla> Anybody know how to get the date picker bootstrap to fire off something else other than the little calendar button? I chucked the same class onto a button but now all the styles are being applied to it also
[13:41:15] <muffinrecon> is it like a login system?
[13:41:45] <sekyms> muffinrecon: nah this i just a comment system I'm use fucking around with this as a joke as a weight loss site for work
[13:41:58] <sekyms> really to learn php
[13:42:10] <muffinrecon> mhmm
[13:42:16] <muffinrecon> well
[13:42:17] <muffinrecon> make sure
[13:42:30] <muffinrecon> the user for that system only has a couple of priviledges
[13:42:42] <muffinrecon> prob just read/write
[13:42:54] <sekyms> the db user?
[13:42:57] <muffinrecon> yeah
[13:42:59] <muffinrecon> for the comment system
[13:43:15] <muffinrecon> that's incase they manage to bypass all the validation
[13:43:26] <muffinrecon> and usel msqli
[13:43:33] <muffinrecon> much better than mysql
[13:43:50] <sekyms> is that microsoft sql?
[13:43:58] <muffinrecon> no its like an improved mysql
[13:44:13] <sekyms> interesting
[13:44:16] <muffinrecon> they have predefined gets/posts
[13:44:25] <muffinrecon> so it lowers the sql injection
[13:44:26] <muffinrecon> like
[13:44:29] <sekyms> I've been meaning to try couchdb
[13:44:31] <muffinrecon> a typicall call to the server with mysql
[13:44:34] <muffinrecon> is
[13:44:57] <muffinrecon> SELECT * FROM table WHERE comment = _POST['blah']
[13:44:59] <muffinrecon> instead
[13:45:12] <muffinrecon> you'll use SELECT * FROM table WHERE comment = ?
[13:45:23] <muffinrecon> then define the comment = ? in a later variable
[13:45:50] <muffinrecon> so after you escape/validate the information, then you bind it to an action and send it over to the db
[13:45:57] <sekyms> so I encoded the part I was having issues with &#39; in my database
[13:46:02] <sekyms> an d it doesn't break anymore
[13:46:17] <sekyms> but now it puts &#39; in the markup
[13:46:19] <gotwig> Guys have you checked out filepicker.io??
[13:46:21] <gotwig> its a dream!
[13:46:24] <muffinrecon> wait
[13:46:30] <muffinrecon> you're encoding the comment text?
[13:46:33] <gotwig> dblosevn, hey
[13:47:00] <sekyms> muffinrecon: the site was breaking because of an apostrophe in someones comment
[13:47:22] <muffinrecon> oh
[13:47:23] <muffinrecon> mhmm
[13:47:35] <muffinrecon> what's the schema for the table?
[13:47:42] <sekyms> as a temp fix I went into my database and changed it to &#39;
[13:48:03] <sekyms> it works now but the html is being output as &#39; instead of the charachter
[13:48:07] <muffinrecon> yeah i know
[13:48:17] <muffinrecon> you could probably escape the quote
[13:48:30] <sekyms> yeah I tried that with the PHP but was having a lot of issues
[13:49:35] <muffinrecon> http://php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.php
[13:49:50] <guy> Why do I get a syntax error here? $($('script[data-name="table"]').html()); where script is https://gist.github.com/gajus/4e3694a7b269d729232f
[13:49:51] <muffinrecon> try that?
[13:50:02] <sekyms> deprecated
[13:50:12] <sekyms> guy two query?
[13:50:17] <sekyms> $($
[13:50:21] <guy> well, yes.
[13:50:51] <guy> $('script[data-name="table"]').html() returns HTML as plain text, then $() should convert it to jQuery object.
[13:51:08] <muffinrecon> mhmm
[13:51:20] <muffinrecon> idk why it doesnt work tbh
[13:51:22] <muffinrecon> but
[13:51:44] <guy> can people who are talking with me include my name please.
[13:51:58] <muffinrecon> quick question
[13:52:10] <muffinrecon> when you escaped the quotes, it came out in the html?
[13:52:37] <sekyms> muffinrecon: when I escaped the quotes i ran into other issues
[13:52:44] <sekyms> i need to start from scratch on the encoding
[13:53:00] <dblosevn> thought i saw irc flashin
[13:53:16] <dblosevn> what up gotwig
[13:53:26] <gotwig> dblosevn, do you know filepicker.io?
[13:53:41] <dblosevn> never used it
[13:54:32] <muffinrecon> meh
[13:54:41] <muffinrecon> strip the qoutes then hehe
[13:54:49] <muffinrecon> no one will notice the errors
[14:01:40] <Wolfed> I have a resource-wise question. I have a page with quiet a few ajax calls and then events on some buttons for the returned data and so on. I am using $.live(event to handle those. Is that ok to do?
[14:01:48] <veQue> i'm formulating some ideas for a problem. there's a company website that allows a company to place orders for specific parts. and this company has special pricing reductions based on the company's history.
[14:02:06] <Wolfed> Since simply going $.event() doesnt trigger for elements loaded after the page load
[14:02:48] <veQue> where should i go ?
[14:02:56] <niels__> in a modal when a link is clicked i load in some data through ajax, in that newly loaded data there is a form, i want to be able to do an ajax post on that. how would i go about that? i can't even seem to get a an on click alert() working on a simple href inside the newly loaded data.
[14:03:41] <Wolfed> niels__, I guess that applies to what I just asked. I have to use $(selector).live('click', function() {}); in order to get events to work on the newly loaded content
[14:04:00] <Wolfed> I am not sure if using/abusing live is a good idea though, but kinda gets the job done.
[14:04:18] <niels__> since its deprecated i didn't even try it out :(
[14:04:25] <Wolfed> Oh lol.
[14:04:32] <Wolfed> I am still using 1.7.2 so works just fine :P
[14:04:39] <Wolfed> There was an alternative to .live iirc
[14:04:46] <grafi> .on
[14:04:47] <grafi> ;)
[14:04:51] <Wolfed> There you go :P
[14:04:56] <niels__> im using .on, but can't get it to work
[14:05:10] <grafi> make a fiddle then?
[14:05:20] <grafi> surely someone can help

[14:33:58] <dblosevn> ill get right on it :-)
[14:34:01] <gotwig> how can I replace content with a variable?
[14:34:37] <dblosevn> '*[data-content-id="'+yourvar+'"]').attr('src') works
[14:34:47] <gotwig> old school concatanating ;P
[14:34:47] <gotwig> meeh
[14:35:03] <dblosevn> although thats not the best way to be selecting nodes :-)
[14:35:38] <gotwig> it works
[14:35:39] <gotwig> muhaha
[14:36:27] <gotwig> well it doesnt xD
[14:37:49] <gotwig> dblosevn, wanna take a look at my log?
[14:37:53] <gotwig> ehh, i mean code
[14:38:09] <dblosevn> hmm think im good with not looking at your log
[14:38:25] <gotwig> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1673938/
[14:38:31] <dblosevn> prolly a twig anywways ;-)
[14:38:40] <gotwig> go twig
[14:38:45] <gotwig> thats what I'm saying..
[14:39:01] * gotwig does not know what it really means
[14:39:26] <gotwig> dblosevn, when I made it in the developer tools in chrome, it worked
[14:39:27] <dblosevn> lmao nice
[14:39:50] <dblosevn> code looks clean, almost looks like i wrote it
[14:39:56] <gotwig> haha
[14:40:06] <gotwig> can't be
[14:40:10] <gotwig> I did that 100% on my own
[14:40:12] <gotwig> like all of my work
[14:40:13] <gotwig> =)
[14:40:33] <dblosevn> oh then remove the serializeParams and the data lines etc lmao
[14:40:34] * gotwig is a f****king lieyer...
[14:40:52] <gotwig> dblosevn, so whats up
[14:40:58] <gotwig> dblosevn, id definitly gets the id ;P
[14:41:05] <dblosevn> hmm
[14:41:08] <dblosevn> oh its broke
[14:41:14] <gotwig> dblosevn, do I need to make that thing available to the instance or what? It just gets called in the parameters
[14:41:16] <dblosevn> i thought you were showing my code off to me lmao
[14:41:34] <gotwig> I just get undefined for id
[14:41:35] <dblosevn> what thing available
[14:41:41] <gotwig> id variable
[14:42:29] <gotwig> it works in gridster.remove ..
[14:42:57] <gotwig> btw, please only do a sql injection next month :D
[14:43:16] <acriax> Using jquery, how would I read a .json-file residing next to my script.js? Is that possible? With the filepaths and all I mean.
[14:44:08] <gotwig> acriax, You mean like acessing your own creadted JSON file from script.js?
[14:44:13] <gotwig> *created
[14:44:17] <acriax> exactly
[14:44:24] <gotwig> acriax, it is possible
[14:44:31] <shoky> acriax:  $.get or $.getJSON or $.ajax  would all work
[14:44:53] <acriax> Ah, sweet, I'm looking at those right now. Is there any in particular which is recommended?
[14:45:08] <gotwig> .ajax I guess...
[14:45:17] <acriax> I know the file will always be there
[14:45:20] <shoky> acriax:  $.ajax is most flexible,  $.getJSON is most specific to what you want so might be a bit more compact to write.. up to you
[14:45:20] <gotwig> dblosevn, blub.
[14:45:43] <acriax> Alright, thanks
[14:45:48] <gotwig> dblosevn, do you got no id?
[14:45:53] <gotwig> *idea xD
[14:46:47] <dblosevn> i really dont have an id, got to get a new one gotta use my passport for everything
[14:47:10] <dblosevn> that code isnt enough for me to determine the problem
[14:47:20] <gotwig> brilliant
[14:47:21] <gotwig> I've got it
[14:47:37] <gotwig> dblosevn, I just removed the extra "
[14:47:39] <gotwig> stuff
[14:47:59] <gotwig> dblosevn, take a look of my new feature: http://bbm3h11bgo.bplaced.net/project/project.php
[14:48:17] * gotwig 's English does down the rain
[14:48:44] <gotwig> dblosevn, make a new image and then click on it, load content, remove it.
[14:49:10] <gotwig> I guess I am going to get an A+ for my work in school, muhaha
[14:51:31] <gotwig> dblosevn, are you proud?
[14:52:06] <gotwig> what ever, good night...
[14:52:28] <dblosevn> um... a.remove_action does not have a data-content-id
[14:52:44] <dblosevn> it does however have a data-id
[14:53:35] <dblosevn> you could do var id =$(this).prev().data('content-id');
[14:54:13] <dblosevn> but it seems content-id and id are the same value so you could also do var id = $(this).data('id')
[14:54:57] <dblosevn> since when did they start teaching jquery in school?
[15:02:00] <JBlitzen> Where can I find documentation on exactly what the event and ui parameters in jquery-ui callbacks expose?
[15:07:56] <Sabrina-> Hi, I m trying to use jquery for clone a paragraph in a form but when i m push the button I m redirecting to the submit page.. any idea?
[15:24:14] <acriax> Sabrina-: is this what you're looking for? http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[15:24:44] <czytacz> is there a way to make a clicked element keep css hover effect?
[15:27:27] <acriax> czytacz: give it a class, like "active", and in the css, change 'element:hover' to 'element:hover, .active'
[15:28:53] <czytacz> acriax: right, that's simpler than what I was trying to do right now. Thanks
[15:37:31] <Sabrina-> acriax thank you very much for the hind, that was it.. :D :*
[15:37:56] <acriax> oh np *blushes* xP
[16:03:08] <JBlitzen> Okay
[16:03:12] <JBlitzen> I've got a serious problem
[16:03:20] <JBlitzen> I'm using jquery and jquery ui
[16:03:31] <JBlitzen> I have two droppable divs
[16:03:38] <JBlitzen> One is on top of the other and smaller, like a toolbar
[16:03:44] <JBlitzen> I have draggable divs on the toolbar
[16:04:02] <JBlitzen> When I drag one to the main area, I detach it and append it to the main area
[16:04:17] <JBlitzen> At this point, in IE 9, it stops triggering drop events no matter where I drag it
[16:04:22] <JBlitzen> In Firefox it works fine
[16:04:30] <JBlitzen> Any idea wtf is going on?
[16:04:37] <JBlitzen> Or how to even diagnose it?
[16:10:25] <JBlitzen> Is jsfiddle down or what, what am I missing
[16:10:56] <coldhead> seems to be struggling
[16:15:35] <JBlitzen> http://jsfiddle.net/8YHM4/18/
[16:15:39] <JBlitzen> Why is that not dragging
[16:16:03] <JBlitzen> (nod, cold)
[16:18:23] <JBlitzen> Ah, hadn't checked the jquery ui box
[16:18:24] <JBlitzen> k
[16:18:33] <coldhead> great work everyone
[16:22:32] <JBlitzen> Haha
[16:23:59] <JBlitzen> Whoa
[16:24:03] <JBlitzen> I set up a test case
[16:24:05] <JBlitzen> http://jsfiddle.net/8YHM4/31/
[16:24:08] <JBlitzen> And there it works
[16:24:14] <JBlitzen> So whytf does it not work in my real code
[16:24:18] <JBlitzen> Hmm
[16:29:49] <grafi> Found yourself a heisenbug ^^
[16:30:34] <JBlitzen> lol
[16:30:35] <JBlitzen> nod
[16:30:43] <JBlitzen> Oh well, at least it works in that test case
[16:30:57] <JBlitzen> Now I'm building the test case back up to match the full version to see where it goes wrong
[16:32:40] <coldhead> keep us posted
[16:32:55] * coldhead rubs vegetable oil into his boobs
[16:32:57] <JBlitzen> Snippy
[16:33:14] <coldhead> i'm results oriented
[16:35:38] <grafi> oô
[16:39:15] <thinkerweb> I have a jquery mobile site copied over to my android phone. I can view it two way, using browser url with file:///sdcard... or I can use my file manager and clicking index.html.  Also, I can load on two webserver, apache on my home lan desktop or on my internet hosting webserver.  My site has button which I expect to get autoenhanced.  When I view my site on my home lan webserver or locally on my android phone using file:///... everyth
[16:39:15] <thinkerweb> ing works fine, my buttons are auto-enhanced as I'd expect, but when I load my site from my webserver, or by browsing to the directory on my phone, the buttons are not auto-enhanced
[16:43:23] <coldhead> what happens when you load it in a desktop browser
[16:43:25] <coldhead> like chrome
[16:43:31] <coldhead> are you seeing any 404s in the network tab?
[17:08:19] <coder7Of9> i would like avoid text becoming selected when a user clicks a span shoudl i use .unselectable and user-select or just one
[17:09:57] <nafg_> What does .unselectable do?
[17:12:37] <coder7Of9> makes an item text unselecteable
[17:13:59] <dblosevn> hey dont rememebr who reccomended me a uploader plugin the other day but it looked awqesome and i lost my book mark
[17:17:49] <nafg_> coder7Of9: How does it work?
[17:21:20] <nafg_> coder7Of9: Are you talking about a css class or a jquery method, and is it built in or a plugin?
[17:24:13] <coldhead> dblosevn: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[17:24:42] <dblosevn> that would help me so much if i could remember what week it was lol
[17:24:47] <dblosevn> much less the day
[17:25:20] <Sabrina-> if i want to show some text after a user make selection what do you recommend me to do? I tried the focus event but i couldn't get it to work
[17:25:34] <Sabrina-> -in a form-
[17:25:37] <dblosevn> google doesnt index it either
[17:26:01] <coldhead> i fought hard to make sure google doesn't index it
[17:26:14] <coldhead> dblosevn: you can wget the last few months of logs and grep locally
[17:26:18] <coldhead> if you're really bored
[17:26:28] <dblosevn> lol
[17:26:42] <coldhead> coder7Of9: this seems a decent way http://stackoverflow.com/questions/924916/is-there-a-way-to-make-a-div-unselectable/5581996#5581996
[17:28:36] <tdignan> that sounds like a killer course
[17:30:39] <coder7Of9> thanks coldhead
[17:38:19] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's take a short break
[17:40:13] <dblosevn> ya lol http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/%23jquery_20130206.log.html qq-uploader
[17:40:26] <GetCodeMonkey> I have a site I am working on. The site needs to check an API for 30 listings on the main page and the update them every 30 seconds or so
[17:40:51] <GetCodeMonkey> on a shared solution I keep running into a random internal error 500, while on a dedicated box I have no issues.
[17:40:58] <GetCodeMonkey> Could it be a resource issue
[17:41:01] <coldhead> dblosevn: <3
[17:41:25] <coldhead> it sure sounds like a possibility, GetCodeMonkey
[17:41:28] <coldhead> that's a lot of calls
[17:41:46] <GetCodeMonkey> I know. unfortunatly they have 30 items to track
[17:41:53] <GetCodeMonkey> The API only returns one result per request
[17:42:06] <coldhead> terrible API :(
[17:42:08] <GetCodeMonkey> so I have to make a new request for each item, I can't grab a Json and parse it or anything
[17:42:19] <coldhead> can you distribute them better?
[17:42:30] <coldhead> make a call every 2 seconds instead of 30 every 30?
[17:43:05] <GetCodeMonkey> I can try that I just need to find a way too set it up to do that
[17:43:15] <GetCodeMonkey> it is a Word Press plugin and each call is generated by a short code
[17:43:34] <coldhead> you are in a very specific kind of hell there
[17:43:45] <GetCodeMonkey> Yes, yes I am
[17:46:16] <recurse> GetCodeMonkey:
[17:46:20] <recurse> boo
[17:47:13] <recurse> anyone familiar with html2canvas?
[17:47:42] <recurse> seems i can get html2canvas to work on jsfiddle and jsbin, but when used on my end, the images generate as white blocks and nothing else.
[17:48:14] <recurse> for example
[17:48:16] <recurse> http://jsbin.com/atijon/22/edit
[17:48:17] <recurse> works
[17:48:33] <recurse> when using same code on my end, it generates these blank images
[17:49:19] <coldhead> is your end "file:///" ?
[17:49:40] <recurse> sorry?
[17:49:53] <recurse> are you referring to me coldhead ?
[17:50:11] <recurse> there are no file:// references on my end, no
[17:50:36] <coldhead> i was guessing it might be some kind of security issue with loading via file:///
[17:50:41] <coldhead> i don't have any other ideas
[17:50:43] <coldhead> i'm sorry
[17:50:50] <recurse> =/
[17:52:06] <tw2113> mmmm girl scouts baked into thin mints
[17:53:21] <tw2113> the mint comes from the beret
[17:55:06] <coldhead> you monster
[17:55:31] <tw2113> i know
[18:18:04] <lenswipee> when do you use var?
[18:18:29] <lenswipee> var $foo = jQuery...
[18:18:43] <lenswipee> or $foo = jQuery...
[18:18:50] <lenswipee> what are the rules?
[18:18:54] <lenswipee> thanks in advance
[18:19:21] <recurse> lenswipee: when you want to shorten a definition its useful. usually something like var ThVarName = jQuery(..........
[18:19:36] <recurse> then you can use it like alert(theVarName);
[18:20:08] <tw2113> isn't the var keyword meant to help with scope?
[18:20:14] <coldhead> lenswipee: the only real rule is to use var AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE
[18:21:08] <lenswipee> coldhead: so basically don't do $foo = jQuery(...
[18:21:33] <coldhead> never ever do that, no
[18:21:37] <coldhead> unless you really need to
[18:21:51] <coldhead> and when that happens you need to write a 500 word comment explaining why you are doing that
[18:21:56] <coldhead> and apologising
[18:22:03] <recurse> haha
[18:22:38] <lenswipee> coldhead: you seem pretty cluey. can you go into more detail. both seem to work.
[18:22:59] <coldhead> sure, whenever you create a variable WITHOUT var it goes into the global scope
[18:23:07] <recurse> lenswipee: also if you dont use the term 'var' you're implicitly putting that variable in the global namespace. With 'var' the variable is local to the function
[18:23:07] <coldhead> meaning it's visible in EVERY PART OF YORU PROGRAM
[18:23:15] <coldhead> and EVERYONE ELSE'S PROGRAMS
[18:23:24] <tw2113> just because it "works" doesn't mean you SHOULD do it
[18:23:34] <coldhead> when you prefix with var it means "this var is only visible within the current function"
[18:23:38] <coldhead> which is generally what you want
[18:23:44] <recurse> i just said dat!
[18:23:47] <recurse> =)~
[18:24:05] <coldhead> you didn't capslock as emphatically
[18:24:15] <recurse> haha, fair enough
[18:24:16] <lenswipee> coldhead: excellent explanation.
[18:24:29] <recurse> what am i chop liver?
[18:24:35] <recurse> ;)
[18:24:44] <coldhead> lenswipee: it's a shame you have to use it, JS /should/ do local scoping by default
[18:24:55] <coldhead> instead of just OH I ASSUME EVERYTHING SHOULD BE GLOBAL, CAN DO
[18:25:03] <tw2113> yes recurse
[18:25:35] <lenswipee> coldhead: No language is without fault.
[18:25:53] <coldhead> some languages have more and more terrible faults though
[18:26:03] <tw2113> people still blame crap on a lot of what came in early php
[18:26:07] <coldhead> i still bought brendan eich a beer
[18:26:09] <coldhead> we're tight
[18:26:24] <coldhead> i still blame recent PHP, tw2113
[18:26:33] <coldhead> create_function returned a string until very recently
[18:26:35] <tw2113> is Eich your homeboy?
[18:26:38] <coldhead> that gives me nightmares
[18:26:52] <coldhead> not my homeboy but i have a grudging respect
[18:26:53] <recurse> hey im a PHP guy!

[18:27:14] <coldhead> you phucking php people are making me sick
[18:27:20] <lenswipee> Theres a guy called TML in ##PHP
[18:27:44] <coldhead> i see
[18:27:48] <recurse> yea i dont know about those weirdos in #PHP, but over at phpfreaks we're a cool pack of fellows who know their shit
[18:28:10] <lenswipee> where is phpfeaks?

[18:28:54] <recurse> anyway yea
[18:28:56] <lenswipee> what channel you go on once your there?
[18:29:04] <recurse> whats your beef with php coldhead ?
[18:29:14] <recurse> #help lenswipee
[18:29:19] <tw2113> it doesn't have a J in it
[18:29:26] <recurse> haha
[18:30:01] <coldhead> PHP is a great language for getting things done if you have no interest in programming
[18:30:04] <lenswipee> tw2113: you still suck at WordPress?
[18:30:15] <tw2113> i never sucked at WP
[18:30:21] <recurse> Wordpress is garbage
[18:30:25] <recurse> full of holes
[18:30:40] <tw2113> coldhead must REALLY hate WP
[18:30:47] <recurse> very vulnerable system if you're not up to date and all your plugins are secure
[18:30:51] <tw2113> it's apparently full of holes, and is made with PHP
[18:30:57] <coldhead> all software is full of holes but some software isn't written in languages that make me want to nail my scrotum to coffee tables
[18:31:05] <recurse> coldhead, php can run circles around any other language on the web
[18:31:20] <coldhead> there is no emoticon for how hard i am rolling my eyes right now
[18:31:27] <recurse> its also free and doesnt require winblowz
[18:31:34] <coldhead> i am rolling them so hard it's changing my blood pressure
[18:31:40] <recurse> unlike .Crap
[18:31:44] <lenswipee> windows8 does not blow
[18:32:08] <recurse> well you're talking to linux guy, so all windows sucks to high heaven if you ask me
[18:32:18] <recurse> anything microblows
[18:32:20] <coldhead> no i'm being a total jerk, i don't really hate PHP that much. you people keep building awesome stuff in PHP (like facebook lol) and we'll keep the homefires burning for more interesting languages when you get bored
[18:32:56] <lenswipee> linux will die soon unless it joins the tablet + pc era
[18:33:14] <coldhead> linux that powers every android device?
[18:33:20] <recurse> i guarantee i can show you far more breathtaking stuff done with PHP then you can even imagine being done in an alternative language like .ASPX etc
[18:33:22] <coldhead> that seems to be working out okay
[18:33:33] <recurse> the internet runs on linux lenswipee
[18:33:48] <recurse> and yes, Droid is in fact nix based
[18:34:01] <Wolfed> I might be a few years off, but wasnt there a Galleria plugin for jQuery made by monc.se?
[18:34:04] <lenswipee> You win, I lose.
[18:34:54] <lenswipee> Didn't know Android was based on Linux.
[18:34:54] <lenswipee> And that Internet runs on Linux.
[18:34:59] <coldhead> it's not about winning and losing, it's just about being kind to people who've made terrible life choices
[18:35:10] <recurse> lol
[18:35:14] <coldhead> we can all be brothers and to a lesser extent sisters
[18:35:19] <coldhead> everything's going to be okay
[18:35:30] <coldhead> how about that crazy russian meteorite huh
[18:36:06] <recurse> omg how about the lighting striking St. Peters Basilica the evening the pope retired?!
[18:36:23] <recurse> you guys atheists or ?
[18:36:35] <lenswipee> We are Atheists
[18:36:36] <coldhead> today in the "contact us" spam: I CAN'T GET REGISTERED FOR SOME REASON. I ALSO CAN'T GET THE SITE TO WORK AT ALL FOR EVEN MAJOR BRAND NAMES. AND I KEEP GETTING AN ERROR MESSAGE ABOUT MERGING MY EMAILS WHICH I HAVE DONE MULTIPLE TIMES...
[18:36:54] <coldhead> cruise control for cool
[18:37:10] <Gavilan2> Does anyone know any good css3/gpu accelerated carousel or slider or horizontal scrollbar for iPhone? I have a long horizontal list of things, and I need to scroll them with smooth scroll (the scrolling that continues after you release the touch with some acceleration), that works extremelly smoothly with images in iPhone.... any suggestions?
[18:38:52] <recurse> Gavilan2: http://www.kendoui.com/mobile.aspx
[18:39:11] <recurse> but run their demo's from your phone before you commit
[18:40:15] <recurse> all these librarys claim great interaction, but you;; realize if youre using js to interact with your phones native touch, youll get interception from the native touch control. better to make sure these library are invoking the particular phone OS's native calls when interacting with the touchscreen
[18:40:34] <recurse> especially swipe
[18:43:32] <Gavilan2> recurse: where is the carousel?
[18:44:07] <recurse> its a framework. you'd prob have to whip up your own if they have nothing off the shelf
[18:46:25] <recurse> this will also be of great use dev'ing iphone specific stuff - http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/AudioandVideoTagBasics/AudioandVideoTagBasics.html
[18:46:57] <recurse> maybe not page specifically, but you'll get the point ... its their docs
[18:48:35] <Wolfed> does .on work exactly the same way as .live?
[18:49:27] <Wolfed> I mean I was using an old version of jquery which I just decided to upgrade, site was working perfectly fine with .live but since it was deprecated I replaced all instances of .live with .on, and now its broken. lol
[18:50:02] <Gavilan2> ok, thanks
[18:52:49] <Wolfed> Oh I think I figured it out.
[19:08:24] <Afflicto> I have this object {"data":34,"message":null} how come when I do object.data or object['data'] I get undefined? :S
[19:15:00] <tw2113> i got it working with this
[19:15:08] <tw2113> var myobj = {"data":34,"message":null}
[19:15:26] <tw2113> myobj.data //34
[19:15:33] <tw2113> at least in firefox console
[19:15:44] <Foxhoundz> myobj['data'] looks more cleaner
[19:15:54] * Foxhoundz crawls back into his cave
[19:16:13] <tw2113> that gave undefined error
[19:18:16] <rgr> and it certainly isnt cleaner. Its plain wrong.
[19:18:45] <Foxhoundz> rgr: wrong?
[19:18:45] <tw2113> and extra characters
[19:19:03] <tw2113> 1 dot > 2 square brackets
[19:21:00] <tw2113> isn't it a case of all arrays are objects, but not all objects are arrays?
[19:25:53] <Foxhoundz> Using the bracket notation allows you to access properties with weird characters
[19:25:57] <Foxhoundz> i.e. foo = {"#%%":"2523"}
[19:26:12] <Foxhoundz> so instead of switching back and forth
[19:26:16] <Foxhoundz> I use brackets whenever I can
[19:26:44] <Foxhoundz> I have yet to find a reason why I shouldn't
[19:26:57] <Foxhoundz> and two extra brackets isn't convincing enough
[19:30:44] <shoky> $(document)['ready'](function() { $('a')['on']('click',function(e) { e['preventDefault'](); $('#foo')['append'](bar); }) })
[19:33:34] <coldhead> inconsistency is a good way to keep alzheimer's at bay
[19:36:37] <Foxhoundz> shoky: yes, yes! That's the way to do it, my friend!
[19:36:54] * Foxhoundz twiddles thumbs
[19:40:40] <dblosevn> hmm Foxhoundz will never write a line of code for me lmao
[19:44:08] <dblosevn> I use bracket notation usually only when i need to access an object member that could be a variable eg for (key in object) obj[key] id never do document[location] and is never make my keys use special chars i  use the same rules in my object/array keys as the rules for creating variables
[20:01:58] <ansikt> Hey, I heard from one of my co-workers there was going to be some sort of jQuery meetup near the twin cities sometime soon...how would I go about finding that out?
[20:01:59] <Foxhoundz> That was sarcasm :|
[20:02:19] <ansikt> I found the groups.jquery or whatever site, but the jQuery MN group seemed kinda dormant.
[20:02:25] <ansikt> meetup.jquery?
[20:03:19] <Foxhoundz> yes
[20:03:24] <Foxhoundz> google tells me yes
[20:03:26] <Foxhoundz> so yes
[20:03:33] <Foxhoundz> http://meetups.jquery.com/
[20:04:54] <ansikt> In any case, I didn't see the information I wanted at that site.  Is it possible there's some other sort of event involving jQuery in my area, or is my coworker just simply mistaken?
[20:05:32] <tw2113> i don't mean to be a dick, but there's no guarantee that anyone in here would know about it
[20:05:47] <tw2113> kind of depends on the organizers to get the word out
[20:06:26] <ansikt> I figured as much, i just wondered if there was any other central vein of information I might tap, other than meetups.jquery?
[20:06:27] <jeremy-> is this valid markup: $("#main .form input").attr("placeholder", $(this).closest('label span').text());
[20:06:36] <tw2113> meetup.com?
[20:07:10] <jeremy-> Or do i need to use some sort of for
[20:08:02] <coldhead> that meetup site is retired, i thought
[20:08:13] <ansikt> jeremy:  If I remember correctly, attr doesn't do implicit iteration.  So yeah, you prolly need a for or a .each().
[20:08:42] <jeremy-> i see thanks, havnt really used one but I was kinda figuring (this) wasnt working
[20:08:48] <jeremy-> I can probably work it out now, thanks
[20:08:52] <ansikt> coldhead:  meetup.com or meetups.jquery.com?
[20:09:19] <tw2113> check both?
[20:09:38] <coldhead> the latter
[20:10:19] <ansikt> jeremy:  Try attr("style","background-color:#F00;") or something equally obnoxious, and you'll notice it's only working for the first one.
[20:10:39] <coldhead> "Hosting our own meetup network was an interesting experiment, but the site gets almost no usage and is cumbersome for us to continue to manage, so we will be shutting it down. We recommend organizers use other, more established platforms such as meetup.com."
[20:10:58] <jeremy-> This is the second time ive done this, but after already googling for a few mins, i come here
[20:11:10] <jeremy-> and as soon as i paste the question i realise that jquery has 'for's and it would let me declare 'this'
[20:11:12] <jeremy-> :D
[20:11:31] <jeremy-> Just re-written it now assuming it will work
[20:13:44] <ashitvora1> Hi friends, I'm working on an app where I'm upgrading jQuery from version 1.6 to 1.9. In the current app I've bound events like jQuery(some_selector).bind("enforce.policy", callback); And it is triggered by jQuery(some_selector)enforcePolicy(); This used to work in 1.6 but doesnt work in 1.9
[20:14:55] <ashitvora1> I looks like when I use bind method, anything before period (.) is considered as event and after that as selector. ie. enforce is considered as event and policy as a selector. is it true?
[20:15:30] <xboi209> is $(".class") faster than $("div.class")?
[20:15:37] <xboi209> annd why
[20:16:35] <ansikt> xboi209:  Yes.  It has to make extra comparisons (is this div of this class?  Does this div have this class?).  You're asking the computer to do more stuff, and that's always more expensive
[20:16:42] <ansikt> ACTUALLY, check this out
[20:17:38] <ansikt> xboi209: https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rendering
[20:18:07] <ansikt> Granted, that's for native css interpretors, and not Sizzle, but I don't see why the same concepts shouldn't apply.
[20:20:15] <dcherman> ansikt: xboi209: $( ".class" ) is faster primarily because Sizzle will use getElementsByClassName versus querySelectorAll.
[20:20:45] <xboi209> oOo
[20:20:58] <xboi209> I've been specifying div a lot
[20:22:28] <tw2113> use IDs, even better
[20:22:33] <coldhead> premature optimisation is the root of all evil
[20:22:59] <jeremy-> If i have the structure <label><span>value</span></label><input> and i am looping each input, how can i select the closest span text on each
[20:23:15] <jeremy-> I thought it would be $(this).closest('label span').text()
[20:23:22] <jeremy-> or substitute closest with prev
[20:24:04] <b1lly> $(this).find
[20:24:18] <b1lly> closest climbs up the dom
[20:24:26] <jeremy-> thanks
[20:24:57] <b1lly> oh wait
[20:26:21] <b1lly> .prev(
[20:26:56] <xboi209> hmm
[20:27:11] <xboi209> i have a lot of $("a[href='url']") stuff
[20:27:20] <xboi209> would removing the a element help?
[20:27:32] <xboi209> or cache it?
[20:27:48] <tw2113> not really anything unique to cache there
[20:28:10] <tw2113> unless you specify a distinct url
[20:30:22] <coldhead> it's better to have readable selectors than fast selectors
[20:30:38] <coldhead> you can speed them up later once you find bottlenecks people care about
[20:30:59] <coldhead> but no one will care because they never visit sites other than facebook anyway
[20:41:21] <fat> I want to use JTICKER but i want the divs to randomly show, not in order. How do i do this http://jsfiddle.net/Q6E2c/52/
[20:44:55] <ashitvora1> I'm working on a project where I'm upgrading jQuery from 1.6 to 1.9 . One thing I'm not sure of is… triggering custom events. In 1.6 triggering custom events like jQuery(some_selector).customeEvent() works fine but not in 1.9. Any link where I can read more about this change in  jQuery?
[20:48:14] <coldhead> ashitvora1: does it work with 1.8 ?
[20:54:33] <Foxhoundz> Does anyone do wordpress theme development with jQuery?
[20:55:16] <ashitvora1> @coldhead not tried with 1.8
[20:55:27] <ryanneufeld> Foxhoundz: nope, no one ever.
[20:55:29] <ashitvora1> we didnt upgrade since 1.6
[20:55:40] <ashitvora1> and now we are forced to do it. So moving to 1.9
[20:55:44] <coldhead> 1.9 is a very different jquery
[20:55:47] <ashitvora1> many things have changed in between.
[20:55:55] <coldhead> 1.8 is the happier medium
[20:56:01] <coldhead> and it's still "current"
[20:56:07] <ashitvora1> yea I know but we have no other option. I wish we had regularly upgraded
[20:56:10] <coldhead> 1.9 is 1.8 for people who want MAXOMUM PAIN
[20:56:27] <ryanneufeld> make sure you test with the migrate plugin
[20:56:29] <coldhead> try 1.8, then you can use the migrate plugin to help walk you to 1.9
[20:56:31] <ryanneufeld> just to be sure
[20:56:36] <coldhead> if you really need 1.9
[20:56:42] <ryanneufeld> cause it will shout at you if you do something wrong

[21:12:36] <Back2Basics> Any resouces you would recomend on dynamically adding tags to form info like delicious.com?  (how to manage/handle it on the back end as well)
[21:14:29] <b1lly> tags to form info?
[21:14:47] <goddard> so anyone know how to speed up my situation
[21:14:51] <goddard> this is so freakin slow
[21:14:55] <b1lly> speed what
[21:15:11] <goddard> you notice the slow down when you try and run this function on several thousand elements
[21:15:13] <goddard> http://pastebin.com/gHw97Ejd
[21:15:29] <goddard> you click the button and it takes like 8 or 9 seconds to finish
[21:15:50] <goddard> my test amount is 1089 elements
[21:16:20] <b1lly> can you
[21:16:26] <b1lly> jsfiddle
[21:16:28] <b1lly> a basic sample
[21:16:48] <b1lly> or elaborate the functionality
[21:16:54] <b1lly> what your trying to accomplish
[21:17:41] <goddard> the functionality is in this link http://pastebin.com/gHw97Ejd
[21:17:52] <goddard> it loops over a set of elements that can be nested
[21:17:59] <goddard> but the total number of elements is only 1089
[21:18:15] <b1lly> you want to walk the dom?
[21:18:28] <goddard> when you click the bottom the second bit of code is considerably slower then the first bit
[21:19:20] <tw2113> just go with the first one then?
[21:19:41] <tw2113> loops tend to be slower
[21:20:16] <goddard> tw2113, i would but the issue is i also need to do some logic to determine if i need to change some text on an element inside the <h3> tag
[21:20:26] <goddard> that is why i made that second bit
[21:20:35] <goddard> but didn't realize it would slow down so much
[21:22:08] <b1lly> goddard: are you trying to iterate through a collection of h3s?
[21:22:33] <goddard> yeah pretty much and they are nested
[21:22:50] <b1lly> by nested
[21:22:58] <b1lly> you mean <h3><h3></h3></h3>
[21:24:48] <goddard> well no.it is kind of a accordion i made, but it allows multiple elements to be open and multiple "accordions" can be inside other elements up to 12 levels deep
[21:25:15] <goddard> so<h3><div><h3><div> blah blah
[21:25:50] <b1lly> so what are you trying to do
[21:26:10] <b1lly> trigger 12 accordion animations at once?
[21:26:50] <goddard> i have a button that expands all elements at once and collapses all at once
[21:27:08] <b1lly> right, so you click
[21:27:22] <b1lly> and then if the element has children, it triggers an animation on all of them (upto 12)
[21:27:54] <goddard> yep
[21:28:02] <goddard> so it is hard on the client
[21:28:09] <b1lly> yes
[21:28:25] <b1lly> 12 animations at once will be a heavy load on the browser no matter which way you slice it
[21:28:49] <goddard> damn seriously
[21:28:52] <b1lly> although you can probably chain them one at a time
[21:29:02] <goddard> they make 3d games and it cane handle this?
[21:29:21] <b1lly> 3d games leverage webGL, your animations do not
[21:30:46] <goddard> haha
[21:30:51] <goddard> ya i guess thats true
[21:31:08] <goddard> what is this chaining your talking about billy?
[21:31:38] <b1lly> waiting for one to finish and fire the next
[21:32:30] <goddard> here is my current complete logic http://pastebin.com/179jfdsc
[21:32:33] <b1lly> use callbacks or build an animation que
[21:32:54] <goddard> I'm just learning more complex javascript/jquery programming
[21:34:05] <b1lly> oh, your not using animations, your using .hide()
[21:34:57] <goddard> is that bad?
[21:35:01] <b1lly> no
[21:35:03] <coldhead> you're* you're*
[21:35:33] <goddard> oh
[21:35:54] <b1lly> so
[21:36:01] <b1lly> im wondering if you try $('#review-accordion h3').each(function() { // do stuff });
[21:36:41] <b1lly> and just do $(this).hide();
[21:36:58] <goddard> let me give it a shot and see if it makes a difference
[21:39:21] <goddard> it doesn't help any that I can tell
[21:39:46] <b1lly> or you can do var $h3 = $('#review-accordion').find('h3');                 $h3.each(function() { // do stuff });
[21:40:42] <goddard> ok one sec
[21:43:08] <coldhead> goddard: you probably need to use something like this, with the callback that runs when each animation is gombleted http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[21:43:30] <b1lly> coldhead: hes not using animation
[21:43:54] <coldhead> then i have ventured all and lost
[21:44:15] <b1lly> hah, he's just triggering an outrageous amount of .find()'s
[21:44:22] <b1lly> within an iteration
[21:45:05] <b1lly> how you doing coldhead?
[21:46:06] <coldhead> not so bad
[21:46:12] <coldhead> need to get some sleep sometime
[21:46:16] <coldhead> maybe later this week
[21:46:22] <coldhead> really looking forward to that
[21:47:00] <b1lly> hah
[21:47:02] <b1lly> i hear you
[21:47:07] <b1lly> you should try and work that into your schedule a bit more
[21:47:32] <goddard> if i was some uber query pimp how would i do this?
[21:47:43] <goddard> you keep bringing up animations
[21:47:48] <goddard> is that perform better?
[21:47:58] <b1lly> it would perform way worse
[21:49:33] <coldhead> the really good jquery pimps would simplify the requirements so they only needed to show or hide a single element
[21:49:48] <coldhead> then they'd file an invoice for 5 figures and go to a strip club
[21:50:02] <coldhead> or minigolf
[21:52:14] <b1lly> goddard: put together a JSFIDDLE
[21:52:18] <b1lly> please
[21:52:51] <goddard> fuck
[21:52:55] <goddard> opps
[21:53:00] <goddard> i mean damn i need that job
[21:58:43] <b1lly>  goddard: jsfiddle up?
[21:59:08] <goddard> nah sorry man ill make one soon gotta eat real fast
[21:59:45] <b1lly> ok well I wont be here to ehlp
[22:00:21] <coldhead> quitter
[22:00:35] <b1lly> hahha
[22:00:44] <b1lly> going to bed soon
[22:01:10] <coldhead> so jealous
[22:11:30] <b1lly> aight
[22:11:33] <b1lly> later
[22:34:02] <jtr> is there a way in jquery to enable html encoding for all data ?
[22:34:10] <thinkerweb> how do you ake a these sliders that loop, just a while()
[22:38:01] <monk3y> jtr: how are you pushing data back and forth?  Full-page submits, or $.ajax calls?
[22:38:39] <jtr> both
[22:41:19] <jtr> i can manually encode the values by doing a jQuery('<div />').text(value).html()
[22:41:57] <djQuery> so what irc to ask about indexedDB stuff
[22:46:14] <coldhead> djQuery: maybe these guys https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC
[22:54:14] <GetCodeMonkey> Coldhead thanks for your input earlier
[22:54:27] <GetCodeMonkey> I went back to the API developer and was able to get a full Json return of all items
[22:58:32] <scroat> is there a way to print the contents of the root of what url() would be?
[22:58:55] <prefix> hey, how do I fade in an iframe on hover?
[22:58:58] <scroat> if I pass "/img/foo.png" in my html, would there be an img under / for jquery?
[22:59:43] <Cork> scroat: an url that starts with / is an absolute path yes
[23:00:14] <Cork> without the / its a relative one, and will load relative to the file its written in
[23:00:53] * Cork glares at bot-t 
[23:02:28] <scroat> so why doesn't the following work? $("body").css("cursor", "url(/img/refresh_spinner.gif)");
[23:02:58] <scroat> <img src="/img/refresh_spinner.gif" />   this worked
[23:03:07] <Cork> it should work
[23:03:11] <scroat> nope.
[23:03:32] <scroat> $("body").css("cursor", "progress");  // works, but not for setting url()
[23:04:35] <prefix> how can iframes be accessed using jquery?
[23:06:17] <Cork> scroat: i'm not sure you can use a gif as cursor
[23:06:26] <Cork> i THINK it has to be a cur file
[23:07:03] <Cork> hmm no gif should be valid
[23:09:36] <Cork> prefix: doesn't look like you can set the cursor for body
[23:15:35] <Cork> prefix: opps sorry wrong nick
[23:15:46] <Cork> scroat: ^ that was for you
[23:15:49] <Cork> and http://jsfiddle.net/3jbHd/
[23:16:09] <Cork> prefix: yes, the iframe element can, the content of the iframe is another matter
[23:16:59] <prefix> Cork can I hide an iframe?
[23:17:07] <Cork> prefix: hide yes
[23:17:20] <Cork> $('iframe').hide()
[23:17:38] <Cork> if you can fade it is another matter
[23:18:22] <prefix> why is that?
[23:19:40] <Cork> prefix: http://jsfiddle.net/VMEek/
[23:19:58] <Cork> prefix: wasn't sure if it had the same limitations as object/embed
[23:20:00] <Cork> but it didn't
[23:20:04] <prefix> ok
[23:20:06] <prefix> yeah got it
[23:25:53] <faat> I have a website with some jquery elements http://localhost/site/. I have a virtual tab which doesn't work unless i put its code just below <head>, but if i do that, my floating bar doesn't work (everything else works). How do i fix this http://pastebin.com/JrjDMS60
[23:27:19] <Cork> faat: you prob have something else on your site that uses $
[23:27:38] <Cork> try noConflict see ?.noconflict
[23:27:50] <Cork> BAH...
[23:28:10] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[23:30:43] <faat> cork: i have this       $(document).ready(function() { for my js ticker
[23:30:57] <Cork> jQuery(document)
[23:31:06] <Cork> (if you use noConflict)
[23:31:08] <faat> oh
[23:31:18] <Cork> btw jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[23:31:44] <faat> i have this instead:   $(document).ready(function() {
[23:31:59] <Cork> if you run noConflict $ won't be jquery
[23:32:11] <Cork> so you need to run jQuery(document).ready(function($) { IF you do that
[23:32:18] <faat> should i change it to jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[23:33:57] <faat> cork: my virtual tabs (the one that isn't working ) has this :    window.onload=function(){        $(function() {.
[23:34:02] <monk3y> And remember: $(document).ready(function()) fires relatively earlier in IE.*, meaning before some/all the elements are attached to the DOM, so if you're relying on binding/listening to any element events ($("#submit-btn").on("click"..)) .. then it won't attach.
[23:34:56] <Cork> monk3y: no, thats the opposite older ie triggers ready when onload fires
[23:35:26] <Cork> if you have problems with ready its most of the time cause you use it outside of head
[23:35:58] <monk3y> I'm not sure what you meant ("that's the opposite"), but what's the effect when you call document.ready outside of head?
[23:36:29] <Cork> monk3y: it fires in a way you can't predict
[23:36:42] <monk3y> k
[23:37:44] <monk3y> Well I also had the n00bie mistake of trying to log to the console in IE before it was open.  That bug took me 3 weeks to find; 'cause I couldn't reproduce (every time I tested I had the console open), and I couldn't visit the users.
[23:38:02] <monk3y> So document.ready might not have been a factor after-all.
[23:38:50] <Cork> heh, ya ie and console.log sucks
[23:40:29] <monk3y> Yeah man.  It frustrated me no-end.  I had debugging everywhere, was ajax-submitting-emailing events and debugging info every second line of the site.
[23:40:57] <tw2113> IE has real debugging tools?
[23:43:01] <Cork> uh.. no
[23:43:34] <Cork> monk3y: that said, you shouldn't have console.log laying around in the page unless you currently need it
[23:43:41] <Cork> it will slow down the page quite a bit
[23:44:29] <monk3y> Yeah I know it.  Just need it at the moment.  I'm following Google's M.O. of releasing sites to the public but calling them 'beta'.
[23:45:08] <monk3y> And the clients truncated some of my testing time, and failed to do the testing they said they would .. so unfortunately I've got to have the site spitting stuff out (to the console) in live.
