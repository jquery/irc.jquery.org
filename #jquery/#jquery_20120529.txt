[00:07:36] <ryanaz> Apparently most people have switched from XML to JSON..  I guess I'm super late to this party..
[00:07:50] <ryanaz> any reason to not just focus on JSON and ditch my XML ?
[00:08:37] <tw2113> mmm json
[00:09:39] <ryanaz> what's the big difference between json and jsonp
[00:10:12] <tw2113> http://web.onassar.com/blog/2009/07/25/jsonp-vs-json-amazing-for-apis/
[00:11:46] <tw2113> http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/
[00:12:10] <ravenzz> do someone know a good library for js errors logging?
[00:12:37] <Cork> ravenzz: you mean send it back to the server?
[00:13:59] <ravenzz> yep
[00:15:02] <ravenzz> window.onerror ?
[00:17:03] <cayuse> hey guys i've done some pretty extensive research on this subject, and I can't quite crack it  I'm trying to use datatables, but i want the various columns to have onclick-like functionality and cause other jquery actions to take place.. currently i'm filling the table with a 'javascript array' but i could do ajax sorce too.. should i just bulid full-on links in the original source? i think this would suck hard core using javas
[00:26:44] <ryanaz> Cork:  Converting to JSON, how do I retrieve the data from this object?  status: Array[1] 0: "success" length: 1
[00:27:08] <Cork> is that really json?
[00:27:18] <Xotix> hi, i'm having a little problem in ie8. http://tinyw.in/ariC if you upload a pic and then type something at width: (breite) it should calculate the height. In ie, this doesn't work very well, why? in ie8 you need to click the input twice to get it staring
[00:27:57] <Cork> ryanaz: it should be {"status": { "success": <value> }}
[00:29:52] <ryanaz> Cork: got it
[00:31:13] <ryanaz> Cork:  {"status":"success"}
[00:31:30] <ryanaz> Cork:  that looks better
[00:31:33] <Cork> data['status'] then
[00:31:38] <Cork> or data.status
[00:33:21] <ryanaz>               var status = $(json).data.status;
[00:36:49] <somebuddy> hey, I was wondering if anyone has heard of this problem before?  JQuery cycle seems to be hardcoded to 5 slides for me..
[00:37:09] <somebuddy> if i have less than that it displays blank slides, and if more than 5 it drops some of them
[00:39:10] <ryanaz> cork:  like yousaid                var status = json.status;
[00:39:55] <Cork> ryanaz: yes, if you tell jquery its json, and the server sends the correct mimetype it should work
[00:40:17] <ryanaz> yup, working good..
[00:40:55] <ryanaz> is json.status and $(json).status the same ?
[00:41:56] <tw2113> i wouldn't think so
[00:42:09] <tw2113> i assume json is the variable holding the response
[00:45:22] <ryanaz> Cork tw2113: thanks for the help
[00:45:46] <ryanaz> i'm falling asleep at the keyboard... time to go to bed
[00:46:51] <hooloovoo> nooooo
[00:46:53] <hooloovoo> nonono
[00:47:02] <hooloovoo> no sleep
[00:52:09] <tga> in jquery mobile you can changePage by ID, right?
[01:06:20] <rioch> In document ready I've attached a handler for when a select box changes. However, it is only called once. Any idea why that might be?
[01:06:36] <hooloovoo> yup
[01:07:13] <rioch> hooloovoo: Can you tell me?
[01:07:14] <hooloovoo> it's likely that you're replacing the handler with another element so the attached event dissapears
[01:07:56] <rioch> Yes, I replace all the combo boxes. How do I reattach the handler?
[01:12:26] <rioch> hooloovoo: no worries, I got it. Thanks for the help :)
[01:12:30] <Nece228> hello
[01:12:42] <hooloovoo> rioch: np =)
[01:12:43] <Nece228> so i have json output in html which is hidden using css
[01:12:54] <Nece228> how to actually extract only what i want with jquery?
[01:13:08] <Nece228> in the same document
[01:15:56] <g[r]eek> Hi fellas. I've got the current row in a variable. I'd like to test if it's predecessor is the first row in the table. I'm trying to do it with row.prev().is(...) but I'm not sure about the selector (or whether I'm on the right track at all). Any tips? Thanks
[01:16:04] <g[r]eek> *its
[01:18:06] * tga wonders why mobileinit doesn't fire in a jquery mobile app
[01:18:08] <hooloovoo> g[r]eek: hmmm... try row.prev().is(":first")
[01:18:10] <hooloovoo> maybe?
[01:18:20] <tga> it's $(document).on('mobileinit', â€¦), right?
[01:18:28] <g[r]eek> hooloovoo, just tried that to no avail I'm afraid
[01:18:32] <hooloovoo> oh also you can get the index of a element in a matched result list
[01:18:33] <hooloovoo> a sec
[01:18:59] <g[r]eek> hooloovoo, that would be ideal :)
[01:19:24] <hooloovoo> g[r]eek: try $("tr").index(row.prev());
[01:19:27] <hooloovoo> or something like that
[01:20:33] <Eshu> HI
[01:22:46] <alfik> hey i want to make an image load fade in background how i can check in jquery if this is loaded ? Image3= new Image(140,35) Image3.src = "src/logo.png"
[01:23:44] <g[r]eek> hooloovoo, thanks I'll try that. Any idea why this doesn't work... I give the first row a class of 'header' and then I say if(row.prev().not('tr.header')) but this doesn't do it
[01:24:10] <g[r]eek> using not instead of is due to the condition, but you get the idea ;)
[01:25:23] <hooloovoo> g[r]eek: that would give you the previous row unless it's tr.header i think
[01:25:24] <hishi> Hello, does any1 here have any experience with the accordion menu.js made by Marco van Hylckama Vlieg? I cant understand why it wont collapse my navigation on the left @ www.backinstallation.se/index.php?id=49
[01:31:12] <alfik> hey guys i have this but it dont works <script type="text/javascript"> $(window).load(function() {     $("body").fadeIn("slow"); }); </script>
[01:31:39] <g[r]eek> hooloovoo, I think I know what the problem is... .not() doesn't return a boolean (I'm still stuck in a basic javascript frame of mind I guess...) so for example, this won't work as expected: if(row.prev().not('tr.header')) {...}
[01:35:17] <g[r]eek> hooloovoo, so this works for example: if(row.prev().index() > 0)
[01:35:39] <g[r]eek> but I'd rather use a class selector along the lines of if(row.prev().not('.header'))
[01:36:45] <hooloovoo> g[r]eek: oh right
[01:36:51] <hooloovoo> instead of .not use .hasClass
[01:36:54] <hooloovoo> that works
[01:36:59] <hooloovoo> but i'd use index
[01:37:19] <Sm0ke0ut> Hello :). Is it possible to do something like this: jQuery(document, 'input[name="zipcode"]').bind('keyup ready', function() { ? or perhaps link it to the same "function"
[01:37:47] <sacho> g[r]eek, .not().length
[01:39:10] <Sm0ke0ut> nevermind. seems to work already, just worked with the wrong data
[01:39:14] <sacho> Sm0ke0ut, what is that supposed to do
[01:40:01] <g[r]eek> hooloovoo, ok great thanks for the assistance
[01:40:16] <sacho> that's not really a valid call to jquery()
[01:41:11] <g[r]eek> sacho, please help me understand why? Or was that not meant for me?
[01:42:16] <g[r]eek> hooloovoo, random question, but how would I achieve the opposite of hasClass(), ie: hasClassNot() ? :)
[01:42:37] <hooloovoo> !el.hasClass()
[01:42:43] <g[r]eek> oh right
[01:42:46] <g[r]eek> hah, thanks
[01:42:46] <rabbi1> what will be the link for validate.js in google CDN
[01:42:50] <hooloovoo> np =P
[01:43:35] <g[r]eek> Cool it's working, cheers thanks again :)
[01:45:36] <alfik> omg.
[01:46:16] <alfik> can anyone help me how to fade in my background witch is in body {background:blablabla...} ?
[01:51:25] <Back2Basics> alfik: could be complex if you have a photo as a background.   is there an alpha on text values?
[01:51:58] <alfik> Back2Basics alpha ?  sry what do you mean .. :/
[01:53:12] <Back2Basics> alfik:  in a png file there is an alpha value with the Red, Green, Blue  making (RGBA)
[01:53:14] <Trisox> i think he means opacity
[01:53:34] <Trisox> ah ;)
[01:53:57] <sacho> modifying the opacity of the whole body wouldn't just touch the background
[01:53:58] <Trisox> rgba
[01:54:02] <alfik> Back2Basics its a big bg look http://fresharea.net
[01:54:09] <Trisox> rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)
[01:54:32] <alfik> back2basics the background should fade in on load becuase its big and load slow
[01:58:34] <Back2Basics> alfik: put the background in the style tags at the bottom of the page.  next have a for statement with a delay
[01:59:36] <alfik> Back2Basics okey sux the body what is when i want fade in a <img> tag ?  when its loaded ?
[02:00:34] <Back2Basics> alfik: do you want to fade in the body background image or an image on the page?
[02:01:28] <alfik> Back2Basics i want the body background but i see there are troubles and a bit complicated so i want to try first an <img>
[02:01:38] <javalover> omg idk if anyone was here when I asked my question
[02:01:47] <javalover> but I finally got it working like 9 hours later lol
[02:02:16] <Back2Basics> I asked a question 2 weeks ago.  I still haven't figured out the answer.
[02:02:17] <javalover> what I ended up doing was the reverse of what I asked & instead of converting my function into a jquery one, I converted my jquery object into a javascript dom.
[02:02:32] <sacho> congrats
[02:02:36] <javalover> what's the question Back2basics? i'm up for helping now that the coding gods have served me well.
[02:02:59] <javalover> oh man can anything be more epic than watching ninja warrior & coding? I think not.
[02:03:29] <Back2Basics> javalover: I'll put it back up in a bit.  but it's validation and sending of data in json format.
[02:04:53] <alfik> Back2Basics cant i do it someting like this ?
[02:04:58] <alfik> $('body').css({backgroundImage :
[02:05:07] <javalover> Basics do you have to send the data in json?
[02:05:32] <javalover> Earlier I was sending everything in ajax but I just decided to send it via php instead.
[02:05:35] <Back2Basics> javalover: I can do it with normal post.
[02:05:39] <sacho> alfik, you could, but what good will that do for you?
[02:05:46] <globe_tmp> hi guys
[02:06:40] <javalover> so why are you sending through json? i'm confused...
[02:06:46] <javalover> I thought json was for recieving data...
[02:06:47] <alfik> sacho im trying to make a fadein body{background} when its loaded... can you help me ?
[02:07:13] <javalover> not saying it can't be done just trying to understand what we're doing first
[02:10:19] <Back2Basics> javalover: it's more the higherarchical nature of json.  Loops are easier.  I don't have to parse the elements to build a structure.
[02:10:38] <Back2Basics> javalover: the structure will already be there.
[02:10:42] <alfik> ....
[02:13:15] <Back2Basics> alfik: .fadeTo('slow', 0.5, function() )
[02:13:18] <globe_tmp> plz i got  a json object like this http://pastie.org/3987617  plz how to the remove the elemetn with entity_id = 16 for exemple
[02:13:40] <alfik> Back2Basics and then ?

[02:19:12] <sacho> globe_tmp, delete data[16]
[02:19:24] <sacho> or well, "16" in your case
[02:20:06] <sacho> what makes you think they're not loaded in that order
[02:20:26] <globe_tmp> sacho: thanks
[02:20:49] <lampe2> sacho, cause the init functions gets a google map and the initmapsfunctions is doing something with this map and this dont work
[02:21:04] <alfik> lol ... this is support
[02:21:17] <sacho> well as long as this don't work.
[02:21:40] <lampe2> this works randomly...
[02:24:33] <alfik> why this $("body").hide().fadeIn("slow"); dont work ?
[02:25:57] <alfik> hmmmmm
[02:26:04] <Cork> alfik: body and window is special, you shouldn't try hiding them
[02:26:14] <Cork> it will work is some browsers, but not all
[02:26:26] <alfik> Cork okey and what will work on all ?
[02:26:39] <Cork> add an extra element around your content
[02:26:54] <Cork> <div id="content"></div> is fairly common
[02:27:19] <Back2Basics> alfik: http://jsfiddle.net/AvG5G/
[02:27:55] <Back2Basics> oops alfik http://jsfiddle.net/AvG5G/2/
[02:28:48] <alfik> Back2Basics but i want fade in ...
[02:29:26] <alfik> Cork its just why this works .. http://jsfiddle.net/AvG5G/1/
[02:29:43] <javalover> oh man that was scary looking, Brent Steffenson on the half pipe 14 feet off the ground..he missed 2 times   3 times would have been disqualification.
[02:29:55] <javalover> ANd on the third try he nails it & moves on to almost shattering the fastest time lol.
[02:30:02] <Cork> alfik: like i said, it works in some browsers
[02:30:19] <alfik> idk its all not working im missing if domcument ready or wtf ?
[02:30:30] <alfik> and my jquery is loaded i checked it with if ...
[02:30:53] <Cork> you check document ready in an if statement??
[02:31:19] <D4> I've got a element which has a height set, 170px with overflow: hidden; mouseenter() I animate the height to 345px. Can I somehow animate to the height it "wants" to be, like.. when I remove height: 170px; -- thing is in IE the higher value height doesn't cut it.. I was thinking like .outerHeight() if that would get the height the element "wants" to be..
[02:31:36] <alfik> Cork idk look this is my complete code $("img").hide().fadeIn("slow"); for all img ...
[02:31:39] <Back2Basics> http://jsfiddle.net/AvG5G/3/
[02:31:49] <alfik> cork so its not working cuz im missing the document ready?
[02:32:06] <Cork> can only guess what your doing
[02:32:17] <Cork> you need to provide some code
[02:32:45] <alfik> Cork what do you mean ...
[02:33:09] <Cork> alfik: either copy your relevant code to a jsfiddle or a link
[02:33:22] <alfik> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/AvG5G/4/
[02:33:55] <alfik> http://jsfiddle.net/AvG5G/5/
[02:34:13] <alfik> updated so thats how i have it in notepad.
[02:34:24] <alfik> ofc the img is src="....."
[02:34:41] <Cork> alfik: are you running this in a ajax response html?
[02:34:54] <Cork> *in an ajax response html?
[02:35:01] <alfik> Cork idk how i can it?
[02:35:13] <alfik> how i can check it *
[02:35:23] <Cork> alfik: sigh i mean where are those script tags positioned?
[02:35:56] <Cork> your not giving the context
[02:35:57] <alfik> Cork in <head> </head>
[02:36:00] <Cork> ok
[02:36:10] <Cork> then you need to wrap the line in document ready
[02:36:15] <Cork> else it won't find any img tags at all
[02:36:29] <D4> I was looking for $('elem')[0].scrollHeight;
[02:37:42] <joelbirch> D4 try animating max-height instead
[02:38:01] <alfik> Cork okey its working ... and now i want to load just my css. background img  can you help me pls ? :/
[02:38:10] <alfik> Cork when its loaded display it fade in .
[02:38:28] <Cork> uh...
[02:38:35] <Cork> you can't really delay load css files
[02:38:54] <Cork> it will halt the rendering of the page until they'r loaded
[02:38:55] <alfik> Cork that means i need use ajax ?
[02:39:06] <Cork> no it means you can't do it
[02:39:30] <Cork> you can delay the application of it by demanding a class or similar
[02:40:08] <Cork> alfik: and why would you want to delay the loading of the css file??
[02:40:27] <Cork> and especially make the styling depend on js...
[02:41:08] <alfik> Cork its so .. my body background:url ....         is very big and good quality so i want to do a system where it will after loaded fade in or idk .. how its done usually .. ?
[02:41:31] <Cork> don't set the background in your css
[02:41:43] <Cork> have a background color or something
[02:41:50] <Cork> and then set the background image from js
[02:42:36] <alfik> Cork can you please help me with code how it will looks .. ? its just this what i need from jquery im usually doing php :/
[02:43:27] <Cork> $('body').load(function() { $('body').css('background-image', 'url(url)'); });
[02:43:59] <alfik> Cork this goes in document ready ?
[02:46:31] <Nece228> how can i open another html file with jquery?
[02:46:41] <Cork> alfik: not needed, it binds on load
[02:46:51] <NodeX> ?load @ Nece228
[02:46:51] <caniuse> Nece228: .load(): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[02:46:52] <Cork> alfik: but ya, you can put it in ready if you like
[02:47:02] <NodeX> ?.load @ Nece228
[02:47:16] <Nece228> ok thanks :D
[02:47:23] <alfik> cork okey i have it like this $('body').css('background', 'url(src/bg-body.png) no-repeat center top fixed');
[02:47:32] <NodeX> $("#foo").load("Path/to/your.file.html");
[02:47:36] <Cork> alfik: no
[02:47:41] <NodeX> where #foo is an element
[02:47:45] <tga> in jquery mobile what's a good place in the page lifecycle to load some page divs and show one?
[02:47:47] <Cork> well ya you can if you like
[02:48:00] <tga> it looks like at mobileinit there is no page and at document.ready you can't call changePage
[02:48:01] <Cork> alfik: but i would just set the image and leave the rest
[02:48:17] <Cork> alfik: move as little as possible into js
[02:48:30] <alfik> cork okey and now how to load it <body onload="load">
[02:48:33] <Cork> it'll make the site easier to handle later
[02:48:42] <Cork> alfik: just put it in the head
[02:48:53] <Cork> along side dom ready
[02:50:41] <alfik> Cork it dont works ... look this is how i have it http://pastebin.com/GB3pqrk3
[02:50:42] <Blindie> anyone german here?
[02:51:01] <Blindie> because, my english is bad ;)
[02:51:03] <Cork> uh...
[02:51:04] <Cork> ya
[02:51:10] <Cork> alfik: your running load twice
[02:51:16] <Cork> opps sorry read wrong
[02:51:47] <Cork> alfik: try wrap it in dom ready (though i'm quite sure it should work
[02:52:40] <alfik> Cork dont works :/
[02:52:58] <Cork> then its something else failing
[02:53:18] <Cork> ex. make sure the url is correct
[02:53:30] <Cork> (it should be relative to the html file, not the css file
[02:53:42] <Cork> (or better yet use absolute paths)
[02:54:09] <Blindie> so, my problem is: i have an menu with 4 buttons, under button 1 is a image, when the mouse is over button 2  the image is sliding und menu 2 when the mouse is over menu3 the image is sliding to menu 3.
[02:54:25] <Blindie> are there any plugin that helps me to do that?
[02:54:48] <Blindie> i hope you can understand me :D
[02:54:57] <Nece228> NodeX: hmm, isnt load used to do something when the page is fully loaded?
[02:55:17] <Cork> Blindie: sounds a bit specific, so my guess is no; but google around a bit
[02:56:07] <Blindie> i searching, but i only found tutorials for slideUp, slideDown etc. but not for slideTo ore so ;)
[02:57:30] <tga> any idea whether loadPage and changePage in jqmobile are async?
[02:57:53] <alfik> Cork idk :/ i tryed http://localhost/src/bg-body.png but still dont load the img
[02:58:07] <tga> yeah, totally async, they're doing ajax
[03:05:02] <Trisox> ?weather apeldoorn

[03:10:57] <Haprog> alfik: how should we know what you need?
[03:11:20] <alfik> Haprog idk normal usage .. of jquery functions etc...
[03:11:30] <joelbirch> $('.horarios .title td:first').text()
[03:11:32] <Haprog> well is it for normal production or development use, lol.
[03:12:08] <Haprog> production version is just minified. development is a larger file but easier to read if you need to know what it does internally.
[03:12:13] <mindis|wurk> if you don't know the difference, take production
[03:13:02] <joelbirch> left that there for twiq
[03:13:22] <twiq> joelbirch, can you tell me a good tutorial on jquery selectors? it's because I need to grab all the information on that table and put it in JSON
[03:13:54] <mindis|wurk> try learning css selectors first and you're almost done
[03:13:59] <joelbirch> not really - google it. There will be plenty
[03:16:45] <twiq> thanks :)

[03:30:24] <fraxture> hey all, i have a general question regarding a problem that i keep encountering when i use jquery to modify styles: how do you prevent a brief flash of document content before that content is styled by jquery?

[03:54:06] <AlecTaylor> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10797637/recommended-way-to-write-javascript-calling-remote-services
[03:59:12] <g[r]eek> Hey fellas. I'm trying to register an event when a hidden input field's value is changed. $("input.my-hidden-field").change(...) isn't firing. Any tips?
[04:00:00] <Cork> g[r]eek: are you replacing the hidden field?
[04:00:07] <Cork> or is it part of the page when it loads?
[04:00:11] <Cork> oh, wait
[04:00:26] <Cork> g[r]eek: you mean you try to get it triggered when its changed by code?
[04:00:28] <g[r]eek> Cork: it's part of the page when it loads, but even if it wasn't, I'd have instead used .on("change", "...") etc
[04:00:41] <g[r]eek> Cork: yeah
[04:00:48] <g[r]eek> another event changes its value :)
[04:00:56] <Cork> one, sec need to make sure before i say anything
[04:00:58] <rethus> what have i to return from my php-script, to get success on jquery.ajax() ?
[04:01:00] <g[r]eek> but that event is in another piece of code that I can't edit
[04:01:43] <g[r]eek> rethus it doesn't matter what you return
[04:01:55] <AlecTaylor> What's the recommended way to write JavaScript calling remote services? - http://stackoverflow.com/q/10797637
[04:01:58] <g[r]eek> rethus if the ajax query succeeds then it succeeds, regardless of what you return
[04:02:37] <Cork> g[r]eek: change is only triggered by user
[04:02:48] <g[r]eek> Cork: aw crap :(
[04:02:54] <Cork> g[r]eek: it doesn't trigger on script changes
[04:02:54] <g[r]eek> Cork: ok thansk
[04:03:09] <g[r]eek> Which begs the question, any idea how I could work around this?
[04:06:09] <Cork> have a function that you use to set the value
[04:06:25] <Cork> and set the hidden field through it, then you can get notified from the function when it change the value
[04:07:03] <g[r]eek> Cork, yeah unfortunately the input field's setter is in a separate piece of code which I can't edit
[04:07:12] <g[r]eek> Else I'd have just extended that function :)
[04:07:32] <Cork> and the function is in a private scope?
[04:07:42] <Cork> or is that function accessable?
[04:07:46] <g[r]eek> Cork, it seems a redesign is in order. Rather get it out of the way :)
[04:07:52] <Chel> question: what is better to use with jquery: <a class="b" href="javascript:functionName()"> or (function() { $('a.b').on('click', function() {functionName();}); }
[04:07:55] <Cork> :)
[04:07:59] <rethus> i got this error in console...: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token E . but i can't find the error-line, cause he point to jquery-1.7.1.min.js:2 and this line is realy long
[04:08:02] <g[r]eek> Cork, thanks anyway ;)
[04:08:06] <Cork> Chel: the second one
[04:08:14] <rethus> any idea, how i could figure out, where the error is
[04:08:14] <Cork> any day of the week
[04:08:28] <Chel> Cork: why ?
[04:08:40] <Cork> rethus: load a none minified jquery file
[04:08:53] <Cork> Chel: cause you shouldn't use inline event handlers
[04:09:11] <Cork> and defenitly not the even older javascript: refixed hrefs
[04:09:21] <tga> when I do $('#loginPage').on('pageinit') how is it possible that $('#loginPage') doesn't exist in the DOM?
[04:09:36] <Cork> tga: the page haven't loaded completly yet?
[04:09:45] <Cork> try waiting for dom ready
[04:09:46] <tga> well yeah, but this is in the handler
[04:09:51] <Chel> Cork: and what to write in href attribute with the second variant ?
[04:10:00] <tga> nah, this is jqmobile, events are differnet
[04:10:03] <tga> different even
[04:10:15] <Cork> Chel: the url for the server none js equiv
[04:10:20] <tga> Cork: my point was that this is an event on an element, and then in the handler I can't find the same element that called me
[04:10:23] <tga> doesn't make sense
[04:10:46] <Cork> Chel: and if you don't plan to have one, use spans instead <span tabindex="0" class="link">click me</span>
[04:11:05] <Cork> tga: you have a link?
[04:12:10] <tga> Cork: ugh nm
[04:12:24] <tga> $('#foo').get() is not the same as $('#foo')[0]
[04:12:35] <Cork> well get(0) is
[04:13:37] <tga> .get( [index] )
[04:13:45] <tga> don't square brackets mean optional?
[04:13:52] <rethus> Cork: k
[04:14:12] <Haprog> tga: usually yes
[04:14:54] <tga> yeah, all fixed now, weird
[04:15:26] <shokshok> it's optional
[04:17:03] <shoky> as the docs say, Without a parameter, .get() returns all of the elements
[04:20:14] <Vainoharhainen> Hmm, why is it not possible to use delay here jQuery(this).addClass("not_valid").delay(2000).removeClass("not_valid");
[04:20:15] <shoky> Vainoharhainen: .delay() is only for stuff that's on the fx queue like animation
[04:20:21] <Vainoharhainen> shoky: okey, do you know if jQ lib have any other function ?
[04:20:33] <shoky> you can use setTimeout..
[04:20:43] <Vainoharhainen> Yeh but i want to chain :P
[04:20:47] <Blindie> who is my personal validator :D
[04:21:00] <shoky> jq doesn't have a chainable setTimeout ;P
[04:21:21] <Vainoharhainen> shoky: :'<
[04:21:42] <shoky> ;<
[04:21:43] <Blindie> :p
[04:22:25] <Blindie> is there any funktion like slide to position xx?
[04:22:59] <Blindie> xx is a position form another div
[04:23:07] <shoky> you can animate position however you like
[04:23:15] <rethus> Cork: ok, now i got a error on line
[04:23:15] <rethus> return window.JSON.parse( data );
[04:23:48] <rethus> but why the message tells Unexpected token E ?
[04:23:49] <Cork> ok, so your json isn't valid json
[04:26:52] <Blindie> shoky, du you have an exampel with it? like slide to x-position of from div with mouseover?
[04:26:53] <shoky> Blindie: the docs have examples..
[04:26:54] <Blindie> head --> table "baaam" ;)
[04:26:54] <shoky> ?
[04:27:02] <Blindie> I know, but i ask :(
[04:27:58] <shoky> uh
[04:27:59] <shoky> $('#myDiv').animate({'left',200}, "slow")
[04:28:07] <shoky> oops
[04:28:21] <shoky> $('#myDiv').animate({ left:200 }, "slow")
[04:28:36] <Blindie> that slid it from left  to right?
[04:28:43] <rethus> how can i catch an error, if something in my ajax.php-script went wrong... so that i could display it in frontend?
[04:28:48] <shoky> from wherever it is now, to 200
[04:28:56] <Blindie> okay :D thanks
[04:29:26] <Blindie> can I gat a x position with this.element?
[04:29:41] <shoky> Blindie: $(element).position().left
[04:30:07] <Blindie> okay, very thanks ;)
[04:30:08] <shoky> hh
[04:30:10] <rethus> Cork: normaly json_enccode() in php should return valid json... even if i send a string as parameter?!
[04:30:21] <keirlav87> can anyone please help me figure out why an ajax call is firing the error function even though the call is successful and the response from the server is as expected?
[04:30:31] <Cork> rethus: yes
[04:30:40] <shoky> rethus: you can check exactly what it's returning in your network tab in your devtools
[04:30:59] <Cork> rethus: but try grabbing the generated output and run it through jsonlint
[04:31:01] <Cork> ?g jsonlint
[04:31:01] <caniuse> Cork: JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://jsonlint.com/
[04:31:48] <rethus> i got my fault
[04:31:48] <lampe2> is there a way to get the current position of the user with a synchrone function?
[04:31:48] <rethus> i have done echo json_encode, instead return
[04:31:48] <rethus> (blush)
[04:32:11] <shoky> return doesnt sound right.. ?
[04:32:32] <rethus> but if i do echo, i only goit a string back
[04:32:45] <shoky> that's what you wanna get, no..?
[04:32:50] <shoky> a JSON string
[04:33:35] <rethus> strange, now i changed back to echo, it works without error
[04:33:43] <shoky> ;P
[04:33:43] <rethus> time for a coffee
[04:33:54] <shoky> time to get ready for work, buhhhhhhhh
[04:33:54] <rethus> thanx shoky
[04:37:11] <Martz_> Hello all! I have a big problem. My JQ functions dont work on content that have 'been loaded in' (f.e. using the .html() function) i've made a small example from what i mean here: http://jsfiddle.net/Nf5r6/1/ could anyone explain me what i can do so functions DO work on content that got placed in the html from the .html() function?
[04:39:41] <mindis|wurk> Martz_ basic jquery: the elements didn't exist when the events were created. use .on()
[04:44:21] <jeffsmykil> Does anyone know of a windows screenshot tool that will take a picture of just the page in a browser and not the broser ui?
[04:45:50] <Martz_> thanks mindis, gonna see what the on() does and if i can get it to work
[04:52:08] <Martz_> i cant get it to work mindis|wurk  :(

[05:08:46] <sacho> you can't call play on the jquery object
[05:08:51] <sacho> it's a method of the dom element
[05:09:06] <poppiez> I'm looking to create a function that can go to the start of a time period. so let's say I select a week, it should take monday to now, a month, May 1 to now, a year, 2012 to now, etc. can anyone point me in the right direction?
[05:09:41] <rosieres> sacho: therefore, what can i do ... I just want to delay that play();  shall I use pure JS ?
[05:10:16] <twiq> is this correct?
[05:10:16] <twiq> switch( $(this).text() ){
[05:10:17] <twiq> 							case 'Data':

[05:10:47] <Martz_> mindis|wurk: thanks for your trouble, but it just doesnt work: have this now:http://jsfiddle.net/KhNRR/
[05:11:12] <sacho> rosieres, $('#blahblah').get(0).Play(), or you could just select the element with document.getElementById(..).Play() yeah
[05:13:36] <mindis|wurk> Martz_ well i can't really help with something as specific as that without seeing the actual page and how it works
[05:13:43] <Blindie> hmmm, this does not work
[05:13:44] <Blindie> http://jsfiddle.net/8ewmD/
[05:13:52] <rosieres> sacho the get(0) doesnt´ work "Error calling method on NPObject" http://jsfiddle.net/nmnNL/4/
[05:14:13] <Blindie> it do nothing
[05:14:29] <sacho> there's no error and the video is playing.
[05:14:49] <mindis|wurk> Martz_ but i recommend you check your selectors are working and #contentmedia exists on document load
[05:14:57] <rosieres> sacho ?? funny
[05:16:48] <sacho> more blurry than funny
[05:16:55] <Blindie> can anyone halp me with this?
[05:16:57] <Blindie> http://jsfiddle.net/8ewmD/
[05:17:19] <sacho> Blindie, that jsfiddle has at least two typos
[05:17:43] <Martz_> @ mindis|wurk  is it a problem that the class is attatched to a image?
[05:17:49] <Martz_> the selectors are correct
[05:18:18] <wb> I have a json from the server, and I want to generate a few divs to hold the data. What is the jquery method I am looking for?

[05:18:30] <Blindie> lol elart = alert :D
[05:18:48] <mindis|wurk> Martz_ if the selector finds something it doesn't matter what element type it is
[05:19:30] <wb> do i just do something like; $('#container'').append("<div>" + json.field + "</div>")
[05:20:04] <Blindie> sacho, it do nothing :(
[05:20:42] <mindis|wurk> Blindie http://jsfiddle.net/8ewmD/3/
[05:20:55] <mindis|wurk> you didn't even have the right framework selected
[05:21:07] <sacho> it "do nothing" because some of us don't like alerts, I changed it to a console.log(). Look in your console.

[05:22:40] <Martz_> mindis|wurk: http://jsfiddle.net/KhNRR/1/ i have no clue what iam doing wrong
[05:22:59] <Blindie> you mean the firebug console?

[05:26:17] <silverwind> jquery doesn't do anything about dates.
[05:28:00] <Martz_> mindis|wurk: no :(
[05:29:04] <mindis|wurk> can't really help further without seeing the document itself
[05:31:02] <shoky> Martz_:  what's this supposed to do: $(this, ".fotoThumbnail")
[05:31:12] <shoky> seems wrong to me
[05:31:23] <shoky> maybe the other way around is what you meant ?
[05:31:37] <shoky> though i don't know why you'd need another selection
[05:31:42] <mindis|wurk> i thought it looked very strange but if it doesn't work without it...
[05:32:44] <shoky> $(this).attr('src')  should be enough
[05:33:17] <sacho> it does the same as $(this)
[05:36:13] <shoky> true
[05:37:01] <Martz_> shoky: the $(this, ".fotoThumbnail") = to select the img src from the image that just got clicked
[05:37:18] <shoky> Martz_: that doesn't make sense
[05:37:23] <shoky> Martz_: use $(this)
[05:37:34] <shoky> anyway that's not the cause of your error, but it's still wrong
[05:38:55] <Martz_> ok, thanks :)
[05:40:55] <shoky> wb: or you could do something like $('<div/>', {text: json.field}).appendTo('#container')

[05:43:00] <twiq> shoky, tyvm
[05:43:22] <rethus> in firebug is see on networktab that echo comes as result, but i didn't got it as result for "success" of ajax.
[05:43:39] <shoky> what is the result?
[05:43:52] <shoky> in the network tab
[05:44:05] <NodeX> rethus : try json_encode(array('test'));
[05:44:45] <rethus> i check for (is_array) before.... and thats works... give it back in network-tab on firebug.
[05:45:01] <shoky> why are you ignoring what we say though
[05:45:12] <rethus> but my console.log("success") inside of success: (ajax-body) will not fired
[05:45:32] <rethus> shoky:  one moment i post it
[05:45:38] <NodeX> json_encode() encodes an array() so it probably wasn't retrurning valid json
[05:47:21] <rethus> ["Entferne Filter mit der ID 2"]
[05:47:33] <antnash> Hey guys. Is it possible, in jquery ui dialog, to give a button an ID, so that I can change the text easily later?
[05:47:49] <shoky> rethus that's not a valid JSON object
[05:48:12] <rethus> and console returns "null" (which is result of http://paste.kde.org/489170/
[05:48:33] <shoky> that is not valid JSON, rethus
[05:48:59] <rethus> k, i do json_encode(array($data)), if it's only a string
[05:49:13] <noregret> what graphing tool do you ppl recommend ? like e.g. pie charts and others ?
[05:49:20] <Martz_> anyone knows if the on() function doesnt work in jquery mobile or something?
[05:49:33] <shoky> Martz_: it works.. afaik
[05:51:29] <Martz_> i cant seem to use the on function in my jquery mobile project
[05:51:38] <Martz_> ohwell, time for some hardcoding then i guess
[05:52:06] <Martz_> is the on() function a new 1? iam using jquery 1.6
[05:52:11] <shoky> yeah it's 1.7
[05:52:20] <Martz_> aaaaaaaaaaaah
[05:52:25] <shoky> in 1.6 use either .bind or .delegate
[05:53:08] <silverwind> Just upgrade to 1.7 :P
[05:53:32] <shoky> rethus:  something liek this should work:  echo json_encode( array('a' => 1, 'b' => 2) );
[05:53:51] <shoky> php is so yucky
[05:53:58] <rethus> shoky: k, how can i handle this: if $data is an array, do the json_encode-stuff, if not, return a falue, that trigger ajax to throw error: ?
[05:54:07] <shoky> rethus: i donno php
[05:54:39] <rethus> is not a php-question... is a question... how can i trigger ajax to throw an error out of my server-script
[05:54:58] <shoky> return an error HTTP code
[05:55:06] <NodeX> have your server script throw the error
[05:55:46] <rethus> i try to handle... if process was successfully (maybe writing in the database), than use success:, else thwor error: in ajax
[05:55:51] <Martz_> shoky: could you care to help me with the bind/deligate? http://jsfiddle.net/KhNRR/2/
[05:56:42] <NodeX> Martz_ : is your content loaded via ajax ?
[05:56:44] <shoky> Martz_: http://jsfiddle.net/KhNRR/3/
[05:57:15] <shoky> and you're still using $(this, ".fotoThumbnail")  :(
[05:57:40] <NodeX> rethus : your serverside communication is agnostic to jquery
[05:58:01] <NodeX> rethus : if you want it to do different things then have your server-side echo out different things
[05:58:44] <rethus> k, thanks NodeX
[05:59:47] <Martz_> NodeX: no, i use the html() jquery function to change the content
[06:00:39] <Martz_> @ shoky thanks for the help, but still doenst work
[06:00:54] <Martz_> and i cant switch to 1.7.2, my whole mobile website does nothing then

[06:04:35] <sviatovigt> if I load 2 javascripts in a page, how can I make the functions and variables from one available into the other?
[06:07:55] <hari_> hi
[06:08:15] <dizzyone> sviatovigt, just load it before the other
[06:09:18] <hari_> http://jsfiddle.net/AFffL/3/  is great for having bootstrap popover visible but in firefox I'm not able to copy the contents of it. can someone please help?
[06:12:37] <rethus> shoky: this is a valid json-return-value?
[06:12:38] <rethus> {"success":"1","filter_id":"2","msg":"Der Filter wurde gel\u00f6scht."}
[06:13:01] <rethus> http://paste.kde.org/489170/ but this even returns null
[06:13:26] <rethus> http://paste.kde.org/489194/
[06:14:03] <rethus> request.done returns an object, with needed values. why doesn't success: doe?
[06:16:16] <shoky> i think that's valid ya
[06:16:48] <shoky> what do you mean  request.done is ok but  sucess:done isnt?
[06:16:49] <rethus> but i wonder why console.log(json); output "null"
[06:16:57] <shoky> you said it returns an object no?
[06:17:26] <shoky> rethus: the success callback and the done callback  are exactly the same
[06:17:38] <shoky> so just use one of them or the other
[06:19:02] <rethus> ah, if i remove the line         var json = $.parseJSON(data);
[06:19:02] <rethus> i got some output
[06:19:23] <shoky> ah
[06:19:28] <shoky> you specified dataType: json
[06:19:33] <shoky> so you don't need to parseJSON
[06:19:35] <shoky> it already did that for you
[06:19:54] <rethus> k, good to know
[06:19:59] <shoky> read the docs of every setting you use ;)
[06:20:09] <rethus> but done and success returns not exactly the same
[06:20:13] <shoky> they should be
[06:20:29] <rethus> success: also has XHR finished loading... message,,, .done doesn't have it
[06:20:43] <rethus> i only know, cause i output both for testing
[06:20:49] <shoky> that's not from the success, that's just chrome telling you
[06:20:59] <rethus> ok.
[06:21:06] <shoky> they are exactly the same.
[06:21:19] <shoky> success might be removed sometime
[06:21:24] <shoky> just use done ;P
[06:22:40] <rethus> k, thanks
[06:24:53] <shoky> np
[06:25:48] <rethus> i use jquery-ui for dialog. whats the best way to do this: i open a dialoge, press "delte filter", send it with ajax to my index.php, (till here all work is done).
[06:25:49] <rethus> Now if succeed, i want to show message "filter successfully removed" in the same dialoge, AND replace the buttons "remove filter" and "Cancel" by "OK"
[06:26:20] <seb_> is it possible to add the value from my checkbox with a $('#form').submit()?
[06:26:57] <jquerynab> I have three elements with the same class next to each other and I need to find out which of them the user is hovering on. I need the number of the element (1, 2 or 3). Is there any "simple" way to do this?
[06:27:03] <rabbi1> Why do i get this error on IE 8 on using jQuery Tabs ... http://paste.ubuntu.com/1013048/ how can i solve this ?
[06:27:37] <shoky> jquerynab you can try .index()
[06:28:06] <jquerynab> shoky: Thank you, I will try that.
[06:28:32] <shoky> rethus: the best way is just to do it..
[06:28:51] <rethus> is it neccesary to change buttons of jquery-ui dialoge inside of buttons: declaration
[06:30:28] <shoky> no
[06:30:37] <shoky> you can use the 'buttons' option
[06:30:45] <shoky> whenever you wanna change the buttons
[06:31:03] <mythgarr> With jQuery, how can I find a target div, and wrap that div within another div? For instance, if the original html is <div id="foo"></div>, I want the result to be <div id="bar"><div id="foo"></div></div>
[06:31:29] <rethus> wow, thats works... i change the "buttons" inside of the buttons-secction ...cool
[06:31:43] <rabbi1> IE8 throws me a "Object doesn't support this property or method" error on using jQuery tabs .... any suggestion please
[06:31:51] <shoky> mythgarr: .wrap(...)
[06:32:03] <Haprog> mythgarr: $('#foo').wrap('<div id="bar"/>');
[06:32:04] <mythgarr> Thanks shoky
[06:32:38] <poppiez> I'm looking to create a function that can go to the start of a time period. so let's say I select a week, it should take monday to now, a month, May 1 to now, a year, 2012 to now, etc. can anyone point me in the right direction?
[06:32:51] <shoky> rabbi1: and what does that line do ?
[06:33:23] <rabbi1> shoky: nothing at all. doesn't load the tab .....
[06:33:37] <shoky> rabbi1: i mean, gimme the code..........
[06:33:45] <rabbi1> o ok, 2 sec
[06:34:18] <rethus> shoky: your right, need buttons- option. thanks
[06:35:06] <rabbi1> shoky: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1013060/  the error is on the Horizontal tab menu .... line 26
[06:35:33] <shoky> poppiez:  var d = new Date();  d.setDate(1)  <-- sets it to May 1 ......    or:  d.setMonth(0)  sets to january 2012..........
[06:36:50] <shoky> rabbi1: it works in other browsers?
[06:37:06] <rabbi1> shoky: yeah, no problem on FF
[06:37:28] <shoky> checked IE9?
[06:39:32] <rabbi1> shoky: nope, we don have W7 in here ... :(
[06:40:45] <shoky> how're you including jqueryui?
[06:41:17] <rabbi1> shoky: locally
[06:41:36] <shoky> just a <script> tag that sits before this one?
[06:42:06] <shoky> i donno, try to make a jsfiddle of the problem :\
[06:43:22] <sviatovigt> dizzyone: it is not working that way
[06:43:46] <shoky> sviatovigt: then pastebin it
[06:43:55] <rethus> i have this both functions...  http://paste.kde.org/489236/
[06:43:55] <rethus> if i reset the buttons to "OK" with option buttons, the dialog has only the button "OK" after reopen for another filter.
[06:44:25] <sviatovigt> shoky: I can do that but I don't know if it is necessarily
[06:44:25] <rethus> can i reinit the dialog like in the first function automaticly, or have i to use also buttons-option
[06:44:35] <sviatovigt> my question was:
[06:44:36] <sviatovigt> if I load 2 javascripts in a page, how can I make the functions and variables from one available into the other?
[06:44:37] <shoky> rethus: then change the buttons every time the dialog is re-opened
[06:44:55] <shoky> it is neccessary.
[06:45:39] <evlh> shoky, you're neccessary
[06:45:50] <shoky> am i :\
[06:45:57] <evlh> you sure are :o]
[06:46:04] <shoky> ;] thnx
[06:47:01] <rabbi1> shoky: thanks a lot. but i am afraid i can't do it, as it's a huge asp.net application :( ... nothing confidential, but how can i jsfiddle, lot of dependency....
[06:47:14] <rethus> shoky: k, works well. thanks
[06:47:42] <shoky> rabbi1: then i dont know how to help further ;p
[06:48:06] <shoky> rabbi1: you could try to isolate the issue and make a minimal fiddle that demonstrates it
[06:48:16] <shoky> no reason to include your whole app
[06:48:52] <evlh> OUT OF MY MIND.
[06:48:54] * evlh dances
[06:49:08] * shoky throws evlh a dime
[06:49:22] <rabbi1> shoky: hmm, will try it out... all includes comes from header controller... anyway, will try my best. ..
[06:49:22] <sviatovigt> paste
[06:49:25] <sviatovigt> !paste
[06:49:29] <Jeff_D> Is there a jQuery equivalent to the DOM Selection and/or Range objects?
[06:49:32] <shoky> http://www.pastebin.com
[06:49:51] <evlh> shoky, can i pastebin this jquery and see if you can simplify my functions at all?
[06:49:52] <evlh> ;>
[06:50:06] <sviatovigt> thanks
[06:50:12] <shoky> evlh i'll know more after you paste ;p
[06:50:41] <evlh> http://pastebin.com/Hz02QfEu
[06:50:42] <evlh> ^^
[06:50:56] <evlh> it's just so... many... repeated functions
[06:51:08] <shoky> Jeff_D: i'm not 100% sure but i don't think so. there are probably jq plugins though
[06:51:22] <shoky> ouch
[06:51:25] <evlh> lol
[06:51:30] <evlh> don't judge me!
[06:51:36] <evlh> it works, and that was my goal.
[06:51:41] <shoky> ;> let's see...
[06:52:27] <Jeff_D> shoky: Thanks. I've been using Rangy ( http://code.google.com/p/rangy/ ) and doing all the jQuery-DOM-jQuery back-and-forth is a major source of bugs. A plugin that would let me keep my head on straight in _one_ universe would be a Very Helpful Thing.
[06:52:45] <evlh> it'd be tough to jsfiddle this page, but if it's the only way to see what I'm doing, let me know
[06:53:03] <shoky> evlh: why not put a common class on all of those elements?
[06:53:11] <sviatovigt> shoky: http://pastebin.com/4pqQfduw
[06:53:38] <evlh> and just have the common class house the e.preventDefault(); $(".AppPgDiv").fadeOut(350); ?
[06:53:45] <shoky> sec
[06:54:37] <evlh> because the fadein that's tied to each click is different for each element
[06:54:48] <evlh> but the fadeout is the same
[06:55:08] <evlh> (the top, pre catsel's)
[07:00:01] * evlh pokes a now non-moving shoky.
[07:00:09] <evlh> did I ... did I break you with my bad jQuery?
[07:00:24] <shoky> na
[07:00:34] <shoky> you could try smth like: http://pastebin.com/FJKQHGBu
[07:00:36] <evlh> okay good, was worried you self combusted.
[07:00:56] <shoky> that way you have full control over the id still, if you need it..l
[07:01:08] <evlh> Hm :o
[07:01:28] * evlh high fives shoky
[07:01:30] <shoky> best would be if those clicked elements have some id or data attributes or smth that you could just use for figuring the other id in the handler
[07:01:45] <shoky> then you could do all of those handlers in about 2-3 lines of code
[07:02:09] <shoky> ah the 'this' there that i put isnt too right
[07:02:18] <shoky> you can put 'null' instead
[07:02:47] <shoky> oops i did it wrong
[07:02:48] <brygo> does anyone know how to easily do jQuery(this li).length?   trying to pass a string doesn't seem to work
[07:03:33] <shoky> brygo: 'this li' ?
[07:03:44] <_trev> $("li").length
[07:03:46] <brygo> right, it's expecting something like '#id li'
[07:03:58] <shoky> what do you want to get..
[07:04:02] <_trev> $("li#someid").length
[07:04:09] <brygo> this's number of li's
[07:04:29] <_trev> with that id...which would be 1 or zero
[07:04:34] <_trev> or should be.
[07:04:38] <NoiseEee> brygo: what is 'this' ?
[07:04:38] <ircjsbot> NoiseEee, you have one new message, from gf3 (10 hours and 3 minutes ago). Tell me if you want to read it (â€œreadâ€).
[07:04:48] <shoky> evlh: more like http://pastebin.com/bntexwB7
[07:05:01] <brygo> 'this' is the ul
[07:05:17] <NoiseEee> read
[07:05:21] <evlh> thanks shoky. I'm trying this one now
[07:05:30] <evlh> NoiseEee, having three gf's is just ...
[07:05:32] <evlh> AWESOME BRO
[07:05:37] <_trev> $("ul li").length
[07:05:51] <_trev> or $("ul").find( "li").length
[07:05:56] <NoiseEee> brygo: this.children('li').length
[07:06:06] <brygo> ahhh
[07:06:13] * evlh slaps ircjsbot around a bit with a large trout
[07:06:17] <brygo> thx gonna, try
[07:06:24] <evlh> why, comma
[07:06:31] <brygo> no idea
[07:06:32] <_trev> or children.. :P
[07:06:32] <NoiseEee> _trev's would work but would also give you li's that might be children of children
[07:06:33] <evlh> lol
[07:06:36] <brygo> I think I just missed
[07:09:04] <brygo> hells yeah, thanks noiseeeee !
[07:09:09] <_trev> or $("ul > li") for first set of lis
[07:09:28] <brygo> yeah trev I was trying to do something like that at first
[07:09:32] <brygo> but I was just doing it wrong
[07:10:12] <johnkpaul> _trev: hey, good morning
[07:10:19] <johnkpaul> nice to see you in here
[07:12:00] <evlh> shoky, that worked great though
[07:12:54] <evlh> the bottom half of the code i sent though, should i create a common class on the cat sels?
[07:14:25] <twiq> what's the diference between $(foo) and $(.foo) ?
[07:15:00] <CyberMaN> I am changing the src of an img tag but the image doesn't show.. if I change it back to the original image, it still doesn't show
[07:15:13] <_trev> Without the quotes on either would fail if a variable foo is not declared for the former and just fail on the latter.
[07:15:19] <CyberMaN> $("#myImage").attr("src", "myImage2.png");
[07:15:37] <CyberMaN> any ideas?
[07:15:50] <twiq> _trev,  my bad. I was meaning $('foo') and $('.foo')
[07:16:12] <johnkpaul> twiq: the first is selecting all elements with tag name of foo and the second is a clss name
[07:16:16] <johnkpaul> jquery uses css selectors
[07:16:21] <johnkpaul> ?g selectutorial @ twiq
[07:16:22] <caniuse> twiq: Selectutorial: CSS selectors - http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/
[07:16:22] <sviatovigt> shoky: any ideas?
[07:16:40] <twiq> thank you very much guys
[07:17:04] * evlh hums like gizmo
[07:17:32] <johnkpaul> ?demo @ CyberMaN
[07:17:51] <CyberMaN> does that mean "show some code"?
[07:17:53] <evlh> bot be broken.
[07:18:00] <evlh> CyberMaN, www.jsfiddle.net
[07:18:04] <CyberMaN> gotcha
[07:20:36] <CyberMaN> http://jsfiddle.net/kR66w/1/
[07:20:53] <CyberMaN> I transferred it as best I could, but it appears that the form event does not fire now..
[07:20:53] <CyberMaN> hmm
[07:20:59] <CyberMaN> in jsfiddle, I mean
[07:21:07] <CyberMaN> Sorry, new to javascript/jQuery
[07:21:29] <evlh> CyberMaN, http://jsfiddle.net/d7HvM/
[07:21:38] <evlh> er
[07:21:38] <evlh> wait
[07:21:40] <evlh> you made one
[07:21:41] <evlh> one sec.
[07:22:02] <CyberMaN> img# ??
[07:22:03] <CyberMaN> o.O
[07:22:26] <evlh> you don't need to do that, that's just me being anal
[07:22:30] <CyberMaN> oh
[07:22:33] <evlh> one sec.
[07:22:36] <CyberMaN> 'cause I was about to perform a huge facepalm
[07:23:40] <johnkpaul> CyberMaN: all of these images are in the same directory as your html file?
[07:23:49] <johnkpaul> "directory", URL path
[07:24:36] <CyberMaN> yeah
[07:24:45] <evlh> stupid question, also CyberMaN. But the code looks fine. Try adding a / in front of the image filenames, so ("src", "/tick32x32.png");, etc
[07:24:55] <CyberMaN> tried that too :/
[07:25:03] <evlh> Oh good, well see. It was a stupid question ;P
[07:25:12] <_trev> CyberMaN, does the console say image not found when you swap the source?
[07:25:21] <CyberMaN> define "console"
[07:25:25] <_trev> firebug?
[07:25:30] <koden> I have two radio buttons, on change I need to save the previous selected value and ask the user are they sure, if no then go back to previous value, if yes then do stuff
[07:25:31] <CyberMaN> chrome

[07:25:34] <evlh> Ah chrome
[07:25:35] <evlh> ;/
[07:25:35] <CyberMaN> k sec
[07:25:40] <_trev> chrome > all!
[07:25:41] <CyberMaN> i'll fire up firefox
[07:25:42] <_trev> :P
[07:25:42] * evlh ew faces at chrome
[07:25:45] <_trev> chrome works fine
[07:25:46] <evlh> Firefox is my hero.
[07:25:56] <evlh> well, Shoky is my hero. Firefox is my browser.
[07:25:57] <CyberMaN> tell that to the 2GB of memory it likes to use for 6 tabs
[07:25:58] <_trev> Checkout the network tab
[07:26:02] <CyberMaN> REGULAR tabs
[07:26:02] <_trev> haha
[07:26:17] <CyberMaN> mem leak paradiso is the codename for the project
[07:26:17] <evlh> Oh chrome creates new processes for each tab, don't go there
[07:26:19] <CyberMaN> :-P
[07:26:26] <CyberMaN> that's the best thing EVER
[07:26:29] <evlh> HOW?
[07:26:30] <evlh> lol
[07:26:31] <_trev> Agreed
[07:26:35] <CyberMaN> what do you mean how?
[07:26:36] <evlh> it uses just as much memory in total
[07:26:39] <CyberMaN> perfect isolation, management
[07:26:41] <CyberMaN> nope
[07:26:41] <bot-t> (109 hours ago) <mikesherov> Tell _trev nice meeting you at jQNYC tonight! Looking forward to seeing you contribute!
[07:26:53] * evlh still ew faces at chrome
[07:26:56] <CyberMaN> hehe
[07:26:56] <Hornet> [15:26] <evlh> it uses just as much memory in total
[07:26:58] <Hornet> LOL?
[07:27:03] <johnkpaul> chrome://memory-redirect/
[07:27:26] <Hornet> I can have 200 tabs in FF open for the memory 20 in chrome uses
[07:27:41] <CyberMaN> you mean that the other way around right
[07:27:41] <CyberMaN> ?
[07:27:44] <Hornet> no
[07:27:48] <_trev> And if one of those dies, all of them die!
[07:27:58] <Hornet> same for chrome ime
[07:28:04] <CyberMaN> wait I got confused
[07:28:08] <shoky> chrome's latest dev update has been crashing a lot :((
[07:28:09] <evlh> maybe I'm just confused
[07:28:14] <evlh> or bias
[07:28:17] <CyberMaN> firebug!
[07:28:17] <Hornet> get a decent session manager and FF is fine
[07:28:18] <evlh> I'm just bias
[07:28:20] <evlh> >_>
[07:28:23] <_trev> I prefer mosaic actually.
[07:28:28] <shoky> lynx plz
[07:28:31] <evlh> Lol
[07:28:32] <Haprog> telnet ftw
[07:28:35] <Hornet> wget tbh
[07:28:38] <CyberMaN> firefox ain't fine but ok
[07:28:42] * evlh hero-hats shoky for text base browsing
[07:28:43] <_trev> haha like stallman
[07:28:43] <shoky> +++ATH0
[07:28:54] <mattfredwill> Really? What are you running on, I love firefox's panorama but FF chokes my laptop with 20+ tabs so I have to stick with chrome : (
[07:29:18] <evlh> I've never had an issue with firefox, and I have tons of extensions
[07:29:18] <Hornet> then you have some bloating extensions installed
[07:29:18] <evlh> Idk
[07:29:18] <_trev> CyberMaN, anyway, check the network tab or resources tab to see if your image is 404
[07:29:29] <evlh> Maybe I'm just lucky, or have a stupid good computer
[07:29:30] <evlh> lol
[07:29:36] <Hornet> both I think
[07:29:43] <Hornet> the chrome devs must have Crays
[07:29:54] <CyberMaN> _trev; shouldn't, but I'm on it
[07:30:33] <evlh> CyberMaN, because if an image is 404'ing, chrome/firefox don't by default show you a red x in place of the image like IE does
[07:30:33] <evlh> lol
[07:30:37] <mattfredwill> No addons, I use it just fine on my main (arch linux) but it's a monster compared to chrome on my mbp, bums me out : (
[07:30:47] <evlh> I didn't know how to say that without sounding dumb but it sounded dumb
[07:30:49] <evlh> haha
[07:31:25] <evlh> if chrome let you move toolbars around, and regained the file, edit, menu at the top of the window like every other windows app, I'd probably use it
[07:31:42] <evlh> but in all fairness, I've been using firefox for years, I'm so stuck in my ways
[07:31:59] <evlh> you can't even move the tabs under the address bar on chrome, not even an option.
[07:32:00] <evlh> <_<
[07:32:02] <_trev> webinspector is superior to firebug though :P
[07:32:14] <CyberMaN> _trev; GET tick32x32.png 200 OK
[07:32:38] <CyberMaN> As for the browsers thing, it'd be best if chrome and firefox united
[07:32:47] <evlh> oh my god that would browsergasm
[07:32:55] <CyberMaN> keeping the low level shit of chrome
[07:33:00] <CyberMaN> and the higher level stuff of firefox
[07:33:01] <rethus> if dataType: json, can i access on "success: function(data) only by data['ajax_result'] ?
[07:33:07] <mattfredwill> I'm the opposite, heh. I'd hide all the toolbars in firefox and stick to panorama if I could.
[07:33:16] <evlh> loll
[07:33:38] <evlh> it's all preference tbh, but chrome doesn't give you the ability to choose
[07:33:41] <evlh> :|
[07:33:58] <CyberMaN> anyway the image is GET'd right
[07:34:10] <CyberMaN> wai not show
[07:34:44] <evlh> CyberMaN, i don't know chrome web dev tools all that well, but in firefox if you cntrl+shift+j , refresh your page, are you getting any items in your warning tab?
[07:34:59] <evlh> I'm wondering if the code is hitting a breaking point
[07:36:27] <sviatovigt> if I load 2 javascripts in a page, how can I make the functions and variables from one available into the other?
[07:36:32] <evlh> i do love how stupid visual studio has a great way of just hording my memory.
[07:36:36] <CyberMaN> something about getAttributeNodeNS() being deprecated, use of attributes' nodeName is deprecated, so is nodeValue
[07:37:03] <CyberMaN> i also don't call any of that stuff
[07:37:30] <evlh> meh. sounds irrelivant to the issue, so i'd rule out the code
[07:37:42] <evlh> Hmm.
[07:37:45] <twiq> inside $('.horarios .ponto table tr').each(function(){ how do I reposition the $(this) ?
[07:38:26] <_trev> twiq, $(this) inside the each represents the currently iterated tr
[07:38:27] <koden> I need to get the previous radio buttons value on change
[07:38:29] <koden> how do I do that
[07:38:33] <evlh> CyberMaN, can you hard link the image urls in the jsfiddle?
[07:38:50] <evlh> actually, do you have a live example anywhere?
[07:38:59] <evlh> or could you upload it anywhere?
[07:39:15] <CyberMaN> I can upload you the index file
[07:39:23] <evlh> and associated images and js?
[07:39:25] <CyberMaN> the post.php just echoes whatever its passed in it anyway
[07:39:32] <CyberMaN> sure
[07:39:37] <CyberMaN> the js is just the latest jquery
[07:39:41] <CyberMaN> downloaded it a couple of hours ago
[07:39:51] <CyberMaN> but I'll rar it all
[07:39:54] <CyberMaN> and up it for ya
[07:39:56] <evlh> ^^
[07:41:09] <evlh> oh wow, how come I've never looked into jQuery Lint before?
[07:41:18] <evlh> That is bloody useful
[07:41:29] <twiq> _trev, so $(this) is on the tr, then I have 4 tds wich then goes each one for a diferent stack.. how can I get each one?
[07:41:35] <CyberMaN> evlh; http://dl.dropbox.com/u/72822890/web.rar
[07:42:59] <evlh> one sec, looking now
[07:43:13] <CyberMaN> mhmm
[07:43:34] <twiq> so can I do stack_one = $(this).children("td:1").text() ?
[07:43:45] <antnash> Does anyone know of a reason that  $.ajax({type: 'POST',data: data.substring(base64StartIndex)});  would work, but $.ajax({type: 'POST',data: {'filedata':data.substring(base64StartIndex)}});  not?
[07:44:50] <antnash> I just wanna be able to access the data via $_POST['filedata'] in php
[07:47:18] <evlh> CyberMaN, you have it calling spinner.gif, but the image you sent was spinner32x32.gif
[07:47:21] <evlh> first thing I saw
[07:48:16] <twiq> thanks
[07:48:58] <CyberMaN> evlh; sorry, that was 'cause I took it from a local copy
[07:49:03] <CyberMaN> on the webserver it's spinner.gif
[07:49:05] <evlh> ahh. no it's fine ;P
[07:49:13] <evlh> just figured I'd check
[07:49:17] <CyberMaN> ^^
[07:49:52] <evlh> you're gunna slap yourself tho
[07:49:53] <evlh> :/
[07:50:16] <evlh> Why do you have it emptying the image from the div?
[07:50:17] <evlh> lol
[07:51:25] <sviatovigt> can someone please help me with this:
[07:51:29] <sviatovigt> if I load 2 javascripts in a page, how can I make the functions and variables from one available into the other?
[07:51:31] <evlh> sviatovigt, one sec.
[07:51:40] <CyberMaN> you're shitting me
[07:51:42] <sviatovigt> ok
[07:51:45] <sviatovigt> thanks
[07:51:45] <evlh> CyberMaN lol
[07:51:45] <CyberMaN> mother of GOD
[07:51:47] <evlh> LOL
[07:51:53] <evlh> don't worry dude, it happens to everyone :S
[07:51:58] <_trev> sviatovigt, global variable :P window.foo = "foo" in script 1 is now available in script 2
[07:52:09] <CyberMaN> the latter was to avoid placing text more than once
[07:52:13] <evlh> ^
[07:52:16] <CyberMaN> I have been at this for about 3 hours
[07:52:35] <shoky> sviatovigt: you declared editInfo() inside the .ready(...) handler
[07:52:50] * CyberMaN yells
[07:53:05] <evlh> oh it's fine, i was doing some ajax shit on friday and was stumped for almost the entire day, the ajax was perfect, and it was alerting the ajax call so the data it was requesting was fine
[07:53:08] <sviatovigt> _trev: thanks
[07:53:17] <rethus> how can i prevent for a not existing array_key in js? in php i can check with isset($arr['key']
[07:53:22] <shoky> sviatovigt: i can't believe you just asked your question again without linking to the pastebin you already did..
[07:53:22] <sviatovigt> shoky: where should I declare it?
[07:53:23] <evlh> 4:30 rolls around, I see a </div> sitting in the wrong place.
[07:53:25] <evlh> removed, worked fine
[07:53:27] <evlh> lol
[07:53:37] <shoky> sviatovigt: globally, if you want access to it in the other script..
[07:53:38] <CyberMaN> wow
[07:53:43] <evlh> Loooool.
[07:53:49] <CyberMaN> btw, how would I add the image dynamically?
[07:53:58] <CyberMaN> the div's contents need to change, apparently
[07:54:03] <CyberMaN> I want to swap images + text
[07:54:04] <evlh> that'd be shoky's dpt. He's a wizard at this shit
[07:54:12] <shoky> o?
[07:54:23] <evlh> jquery in general, you sir are a wizard.
[07:54:41] * evlh gives you a monocle.
[07:54:52] <sviatovigt> shoky: globally I suppose is outside ready(), right?
[07:54:54] <shoky> lol
[07:55:00] <shoky> sviatovigt: yep
[07:55:01] <CyberMaN> div contains an image that needs to change, and a text that also needs to change.. I am thinking it needs to empty() and things added manually?
[07:55:25] <shoky> sviatovigt: or do like _trev said: window.myfunction = function...
[07:55:25] <sviatovigt> this is the same with the variables I declare?
[07:55:39] <evlh> so why not have a paragraph tag with a class, that contains the text?
[07:55:53] <shoky> yes. variables & functions are scoped within the function you declared them. basic javascript
[07:56:00] <evlh> that way, you can empty the paragraph element, without emptying the div entirely
[07:56:00] <evlh> lol
[07:56:13] <_trev> Declare your non dom stuff outside .ready
[07:56:17] <CyberMaN> ah, just add it as a paragraph
[07:56:21] <CyberMaN> good thought
[07:56:28] <_trev> non immediate DOM rather
[07:56:35] <sviatovigt> shoky/_trev: thank you
[07:56:53] <antnash> Can anyone tell me why I get an empty POST for the first $.ajax in here http://jsfiddle.net/nashant/fDKt7/1/ ?
[07:56:54] <shoky> sviatovigt: this would have been impossible to find without the pastebin. do it first next time
[07:56:58] <antnash> The second works fine
[07:56:59] <sviatovigt> could you please also tell me what should I look for in the documentation to learn more about it?
[07:57:15] <sviatovigt> shoky: ok, I will
[07:57:18] <shoky> sviatovigt: read about scope in javascript
[07:57:23] <sviatovigt> thanks
[07:57:30] <shoky> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope
[07:57:44] <evlh> oOo. Firefox beta update.
[07:57:49] * evlh gets excited
[07:57:58] <evlh> 13!!!
[07:58:02] * evlh starts shouting
[07:58:05] <antnash> But I get   data=>//blank//   when I want  'data'=>postedData
[07:58:27] <antnash> sorry, I get   postedData=>//blank//
[08:00:18] <sviatovigt> http://pastebin.com/ybqJkVCt
[08:00:42] <sviatovigt> the slideUp() function will affect a tr element
[08:00:57] <sviatovigt> the problem is that the element just dissapears
[08:01:04] <sviatovigt> instead of sliding up
[08:01:28] <shoky> eh sliding table rows is tricky as i recall
[08:01:36] <sviatovigt> this function has limitations regarding the elements on which it can be used on?
[08:01:48] <shoky> fucken hell chrome crashed again
[08:01:54] <shoky> total crash
[08:02:02] <sviatovigt> so there is no problem with my code...
[08:02:05] <nisseni> http://jsfiddle.net/zr6XY/1/ - I can't get it to work, I want the class to change when the input is changed
[08:02:18] <Hornet> ah, chrome's wonderful page/process isolation
[08:02:38] <Hornet> don't try to slide table rows
[08:02:41] <shoky> sviatovigt: animations are not supported on table rows
[08:02:44] <Hornet> just use divs or divs within the rows
[08:02:56] <shoky> Hornet: it's never happened before, it's only with the latest dev update
[08:03:10] <Hornet> lucky you then I suppose
[08:03:35] <shoky> and even single tabs crashing were very rare so far
[08:03:44] <sviatovigt> nisseni
[08:03:54] <sviatovigt> what are you trying to do?
[08:04:13] <sviatovigt> is not english and I can't understand what your problem is
[08:04:21] <shoky> sviatovigt: but you can just put your td contents in a div and animate it
[08:04:28] <nisseni> as I said, the class should change to success if the value is under 3200 and error if it's over...
[08:05:19] <CyberMaN> evlh; I am using, as you saw, the post method to make an async ajax request to another page
[08:05:31] <CyberMaN> Can I set its timeout manually like I could do with an ajax request?
[08:05:57] <shoky> nisseni: $('langd') is wrong
[08:06:16] <antnash> I really hope someone out there knows why my post is failing. I'm pulling my hair out here
[08:06:16] <shoky> nisseni: that looks for a tag <langd>
[08:06:23] <CyberMaN> nvm, will check ajaxSetup()
[08:07:26] <nisseni> shoky: ah, yes, thanks
[08:08:15] <toddWork> i'd like to extend the .show() method to removeClass(
[08:08:22] <toddWork> 'hidden') when executed.
[08:08:30] <shoky> nisseni: http://jsfiddle.net/zr6XY/3/
[08:09:21] <nisseni> shoky: thanks, but what I'm really trying to achieve is an "each" - will have a look at that now
[08:09:51] <shoky> go for it
[08:09:53] <toddWork> how do i extend a core function like show() to addClass like that?
[08:10:49] <ec8or_> any idea why this columnWidth function would break the gutterWidth in masonry? http://pastebin.com/GcADSkdV
[08:11:19] <rethus> i have this ajax-request encapsulate in a function : http://paste.kde.org/489362/
[08:11:36] <shoky> toddWork: i wouldn't do that. just make your own...  $.fn.myShow = function() { return this.show(arguments).removeClass('hidden'); }
[08:11:47] <toddWork> shoky: ok, good idea. thanks.
[08:11:48] <rethus> how can i return "data" of option "success" as return-value of my sendAjaxRequest-Function
[08:11:58] <xmaddness> toddWork: http://jsfiddle.net/MN72F/ something like that
[08:12:33] <xmaddness> erm rename the apply to originalShowMethod
[08:12:45] <toddWork> right.
[08:13:07] <xmaddness> I used this to override the jQuery trigger moethod to log all triggers to console for debugging
[08:13:39] <xmaddness> but could probably be used for overriding just about anything to add methods before the call
[08:14:23] <toddWork> xmaddness: thank you.
[08:14:32] <xmaddness> np
[08:14:47] <evlh> i need to win the lottery
[08:15:11] <xmaddness> you and me both man
[08:15:24] <nisseni> shoky: not working when I'm trying to apply it to the code :S
[08:15:38] <nisseni> shoky: not even .change() with a simple alert in it is working
[08:15:45] <shoky> nisseni: boohoo
[08:16:22] <nisseni> shoky: I have a virtual keyboard attached to it, that's what's screwing things up
[08:17:00] <shoky> i can steal a keyboard from work for you if you need one
[08:17:18] <shoky> god knows i love stealing small shit from work
[08:17:32] <evlh> lol
[08:17:39] <evlh> haha
[08:19:22] <shoky> damn i might've had some potential future employers here
[08:19:33] <shoky> so. disregard....
[08:23:14] <antnash> Right, I *think* my problem is that I'm setting request headers as file stuff. I really need to be able to pass other data, not just the file, through the post. Can anyone offer any assistance? http://jsfiddle.net/nashant/fDKt7/3/
[08:23:14] <Trudko> guys does jquery have some method which returns number of bytes  of string in UTF-8?
[08:23:37] <shoky> nah
[08:27:22] <shoky> Trudko: but your fiddle works fine, no?
[08:28:19] <Trudko> shoky: yes but I dont understand it  :/
[08:28:23] <shoky> oh
[08:28:30] <shoky> which part
[08:29:20] <Trudko> shoky:  whole part :D i mean problem sis I dont really get UTF 8 but  encodeURIComponent returns UTF representation of each character right?
[08:29:53] <johnkpaul> antnash: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XMLHttpRequest/FormData
[08:29:59] <johnkpaul> I think that's what you're looking for
[08:30:25] <shoky> Trudko: it returns a representation of the bytes in the encoding, yeah
[08:30:53] <Trudko> and then I  look for  combination of either letter number or letter number so I can get combo like this "%E6", "%A0", "%AA", "%E5 but why do I take length of this multiple it by 2 and substract that from length of string -   return s.length - 2 * (m ? m.length : 0);
[08:31:49] <antnash> johnkpaul: I think that's exactly what I'm after, cheers!
[08:31:58] <johnkpaul> no problem antnash
[08:33:02] <Trudko> shoky .
[08:33:06] <shoky> Trudko:  lets say s="%AB"  , so s.length = 3.   the match.length == 1
[08:33:21] <Trudko> shoky: ok yes...
[08:33:34] <shoky> each %XX character in s takes 3 bytes
[08:33:55] <shoky> so for each of the matches of %XX, we substract 2
[08:34:04] <shoky> so it will only count 1 byte for each of them, not 3
[08:34:06] <Trudko> it takes 3 byes because thit is how UTF encodes charcters
[08:34:10] <shoky> no
[08:34:13] <Trudko> ops
[08:34:16] <shoky> because %XX is 3 characters.
[08:34:30] <Trudko> ou ofc
[08:35:12] <shoky> lets say  s="hehe %AB"
[08:35:36] <shoky> so bytecount of original string is: 6
[08:35:59] <shoky> s.length == 8
[08:36:13] <shoky> there is only one match, so we only subtract 2 * 1 == 2
[08:36:17] <shoky> and we get the 6.
[08:36:50] <shoky> if s="hehe %AB%CD"  then same thing. s.length == 11   there are 2 matches so we subtract 2*2 == 4  and we get 7  which is the byte count.
[08:36:53] <shoky> of the original string
[08:37:05] <shoky> etc
[08:37:32] <Trudko> shoky  for hehe %AB we get 8 http://jsfiddle.net/Z3GBe/5/
[08:37:47] <shoky> no i didnt say the original string had %AB
[08:37:49] <nisseni> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/zr6XY/4/ - the error validation is working, but it's making all rows green when I focusout on the first one
[08:37:57] <Trudko> sorry then
[08:37:58] <shoky> s = encodeURIComponent(...) had the %AB, obviously
[08:38:53] <shoky> Trudko: look at http://jsfiddle.net/Z3GBe/6/
[08:39:07] <shoky> s == "hehe%F0%9D%8C%86"
[08:39:13] <Trudko> shoky: so does eac of encoded character take 1 byte?
[08:39:34] <shoky> no. in this case   %F0%9D%8C%86  <-- those 4 bytes stand for 1 character
[08:39:36] <nebmo> hi, the field names on the form keep changing on http://cpaq2034444.rr.nu/WebBooker_ELAL_Cash/Home.mvc/Login I've been told to pre-populate the fields. How do I go about this?
[08:39:53] <Trudko> shoky ou ok
[08:40:01] <nisseni> shoky: fixed it, thanks tho :)
[08:40:21] <nebmo> (baring in mind, it is hosted somewhere else and just a frame on my website)
[08:40:51] <johnkpaul> nebmo: if it's in an iframe, you can't do anything
[08:40:56] <johnkpaul> ?sop @ nebmo
[08:40:56] <bot-t> nebmo, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[08:41:17] <johnkpaul> more precisely, if it is in an iframe from a different origin, you can't do anything, nebmo
[08:41:43] <nebmo> johnkpaul: would an ajax/jquery include make any difference?
[08:42:50] <johnkpaul> no, not unless you have control over that other domain
[08:43:27] <andr0id1> hi guys, does anyone knows how to help me with jquery autocomplete remote jsonp datasource? i am getting response from the server, but it gives me a lot of results like: undefined undefined
[08:44:16] <Trudko> shoky:  ok is much clearer but why is problem that %AB takes three bytes and we only want one?
[08:44:34] <johnkpaul> andr0id1: the response has undefined?
[08:44:41] <andr0id1> yes
[08:45:08] <shoky> Trudko:  the length of %AB is 3 (because its 3 chars..)  but it only represents ONE byte
[08:45:42] <johnkpaul> andr0id1: that sounds like it's a problem with your backend, not jquery
[08:45:58] <andr0id1> let me paste the code in pastebin
[08:46:49] <andr0id1> http://pastebin.com/ayFnKsRD
[08:47:35] <Trudko> shoky: ok so we encode the string to utf8 which js represents as %AB(AB is either number or char) and each occurance of this 3 chars is actually only one byte
[08:47:35] <johnkpaul> andr0id1: that's not using jsonp
[08:48:01] <evlh> Heyo, shoky.
[08:48:03] <johnkpaul> add dataType:'jsonp' to your ajax options
[08:48:14] <andr0id1> oh sorry my mistake then...anyway, that gives me a lot of undefined fields
[08:48:19] <evlh> I'm trying to do similar to what you did for the first half of my jquery, to the second half and it's not working at all.
[08:48:27] <Trudko> shoky and last question  how do we know that it does represent only one byte ? (%AB)
[08:48:54] <evlh> Shoky, you need to multiple yourself.
[08:49:03] <shoky> Trudko:  because.. AB is the hex representation of one byte
[08:49:33] <johnkpaul> andr0id1: what gives you undefined fields? if you console.log(data) from line 3, it's undefined?
[08:49:35] <johnkpaul> line 38*
[08:49:42] <shoky> evlh: hmm wanna show what you did so far?
[08:49:57] <evlh> http://pastebin.com/0ZZ2K3Pa that's the jquery in question
[08:50:30] <Trudko> ok great! Thats all! bb i am going to read something about UTF 8 now 1
[08:50:38] <Trudko> so I dont ask such a stupid questions
[08:51:27] <nanovirus> hey folks, got a weird thing happening... I have a two column page, in the right col I have a postcode search.  When I click the search button a set of results are appended to the 'results' div.  It works fine when there are no results, but when there are results, all the elements that were on the right suddenly jump to the bottom of the left col
[08:51:30] <nanovirus> any ideas?
[08:51:31] <andr0id1> i dont get any errors in the console
[08:51:40] <johnkpaul> andr0id1: that's not what I was asking
[08:51:53] <johnkpaul> when you say "that gives you undefined fields" what is "that"?
[08:52:55] <Haprog> nanovirus: you seem to have a problem with your CSS
[08:52:57] <andr0id1> well, when you start typing, after the second character starts to search by calling the script. now, after the second char i get a list with a lots of undefined undefined: fields
[08:53:06] <ignotus> hi, how can I query if a jQuery element is part of the DOM or not (because of .remove() etc)?
[08:53:48] <nanovirus> Haprog, I'm guessing it's something simple that I'm just goofing up
[08:54:01] <johnkpaul> ?jquery.contains @ ignotus
[08:54:01] <bot-t> ignotus, jQuery.contains(container, contained): Check to see if a DOM element is within another DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[08:54:25] <ignotus> johnkpaul: superb, thakns!
[08:54:27] <johnkpaul> andr0id1: when you debug the data that is returned, what does that object contain
[08:54:27] <ignotus> thanks*
[08:54:29] <nanovirus> it's strange that the empty results selector is appended fine, but the populated one isn't
[08:54:32] <johnkpaul> ignotus: no problem
[08:55:10] <evlh> shoky, you get that link?
[08:55:48] <andr0id1> johnkpaul, i am using firebug...where to see that?
[08:56:08] <johnkpaul> andr0id1: have you ever used the javascript debugger in firebug?
[08:56:20] <shoky> evlh: sec
[08:56:33] * evlh prefers firefox's built in error console
[08:56:36] <evlh> u_o
[08:56:38] <andr0id1> yeah
[08:56:38] <evlh> thanks shoky
[08:56:54] <johnkpaul> andr0id1: then but a breakpoint in the success callback
[08:56:56] <johnkpaul> and see what data is
[08:57:46] <shoky> evlh: http://pastebin.com/tG4ddVtD
[08:58:50] <andr0id1> under the error i get the hash needed for the search, but somehow i cant get to the result
[08:58:52] <kbni-air> greetings
[08:59:12] <evlh> See, I need to learn how to jquery like you
[08:59:23] <evlh> that is incredible. I'm trying it out now
[08:59:39] <shoky> ;p
[09:00:00] <kbni-air> I am working on something using jQuery .appendTo to add HTML for each new item off a live websocket feed to a div
[09:00:02] <johnkpaul> andr0id1: I thought you said there was no error in the console
[09:00:27] <andr0id1> well, i chrome i didnt see it, but it showed in firebug
[09:00:42] <kbni-air> this works fine, but in mobile browsers, the HTML doesn't "work right" - the links for example don't work right, in most browsers it tries to go GET /http://somesite.com/ instead of requesting / from somesite.com
[09:01:18] <evlh> Strange, CRMPos doesn't show the cat. everything else works fine
[09:01:19] <evlh> One sec
[09:01:31] <shoky> ah there's CRMPOS somewhere
[09:02:02] <evlh> got it
[09:02:21] <evlh> Just renamed it to CRMPos, instead of CRMPOS
[09:02:22] <evlh> lol
[09:02:32] <evlh> Works perfect.
[09:02:39] <evlh> Thank you very much :)
[09:02:47] <shoky> np ;]
[09:04:33] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @ andr0id1
[09:04:33] <bot-t> andr0id1, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[09:05:49] <evlh> Oops, shoky. One thing
[09:06:21] <evlh> It's strange, but I get this behavior on click in IE, scrolls to top
[09:06:26] <meowsus> So when I run a function like $(window).resize(function(){ console.log( $(window).width() ) }); It slows my page down greatly. Is there a better way to run a function each time a browser window is resized, or more specifically, dragged?
[09:06:30] <evlh> Any way to avoid it from scrolling to the top?
[09:06:44] <evlh> It wasn't scrolling to top when they were separated
[09:06:45] <evlh> lol
[09:06:48] <andr0id1> jsfiddle is wonderful...but i found out that i wasnt supplied with the necessary scripts in order to finish the project
[09:06:49] <andr0id1> damn
[09:07:02] <b_> I am trying to use jquery autocomplete: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/remote.html but jquery does not show the completion even with proper response. The only thing diff from demo is that I have not included the css
[09:07:06] <andr0id1> they said the plaform is complete
[09:07:10] <b_> are they necessary for jquery to work?
[09:07:13] <johnkpaul> meowsus: yes, don't run code on the resize handler direclty
[09:07:29] <johnkpaul> have your resize handler set some boolean that you can check on a minimum inerval
[09:07:30] <meowsus> johnkpaul, so in an external function then.
[09:08:22] <johnkpaul> meowsus: something like $(window).resize(function(){window.resized = true;});setInterval(function(){if(window.reized){//what yopu want here, and switch resized to false}}, 1000);
[09:08:57] <johnkpaul> andr0id1: what do you mean? you can add external scripts to jsfiddle
[09:09:04] <johnkpaul> b_: yes, you need the css
[09:09:06] <meowsus> Ah, that makes sense.
[09:09:11] <meowsus> Thanks johnkpaul
[09:09:14] <johnkpaul> meowsus: no problem
[09:09:39] <b_> johnkpaul: thanks
[09:09:46] <johnkpaul> no problem, have fun
[09:10:00] <b_> (:
[09:10:03] <evlh> shoky, I think I figured out what's causing it to scroll to top, but I don't know how to solve it
[09:10:04] <evlh> lol
[09:10:13] <andr0id1> well, in the error i got, it says : no such file exists: read_api_key.php , and therefore thats why i get the error. i checked, i dont have that script anywhere on the server
[09:10:28] <johnkpaul> andr0id1: but you're using jsonp
[09:10:32] <johnkpaul> so it's a different server
[09:10:33] <evlh> It's a stupid functionality flaw, that my boss is going to point out I'm sure
[09:10:36] <johnkpaul> ?g what is jsonp @ andr0id1
[09:10:37] <bot-t> andr0id1, What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/
[09:11:38] <andr0id1> i red that, but the problem is: a script is missing
[09:11:47] <andr0id1> it doesnt exist on the server
[09:12:08] <johnkpaul> ah, then that's not a jquery problem, ask whoevver runs this jsonp service
[09:12:44] <evlh> that's why i always localize my javascripts
[09:12:44] <evlh> lol
[09:13:18] <evlh> but, anyways.
[09:15:00] <twiq> when using .send from restify it embbeds the content string into html.. how can I make it not doing it?
[09:17:15] * evlh isn't familiar with restify, sorry
[09:17:44] <kbni-air> what is the best way to have a basic template to add to the page? simply adding HTML does not work out terribly well, as it is causing funky issues on some platforms
[09:22:16] <evlh> ?demo kbni-air
[09:22:22] <evlh> stupid bot.
[09:22:38] <evlh> Nobody knows what you're trying to do exactly, can you http://jsfiddle.net it?
[09:25:26] <evlh> shoky, you there?
[09:25:46] <kbni-air> evlh: it's already up at http://re.jit.su/
[09:26:43] <kbni-air> basically I have stored $('#items').html() in a string, emptied #items and appended modified versions of that HTML to #items with appendTo
[09:26:55] <diverdude> If i have a jquery-node stored in variable A, and another in B, is there some way i can do something like B.append('<li><span>some text</span>'+A+'<span></span></li'); ? I mean, append A inside B at specific point.
[09:26:55] <kbni-air> this is fine in desktop browsers, but on mobile browsers it's causing some issues
[09:27:31] <kbni-air> diverdude: http://api.jquery.com/after/
[09:27:42] <evlh> One sec. Looking now kbni-air
[09:27:49] <kbni-air> thanks very much evlh
[09:28:05] <kbni-air> I only noticed the weirdness on mobile browsers (android 'internet', firefox, dolphin)
[09:28:19] <diverdude> kbni-air: hmm after?? but i need to insert in the middle
[09:28:19] <kbni-air> it displayed okay, but when I clicked on the links they didn't work correctly
[09:28:53] <kbni-air> diverdude: $('li span:first').after(A)
[09:28:54] <kbni-air> right?
[09:29:04] <kbni-air> (I am a jQuery newb too, that may not work, but I think it will)
[09:29:26] <diverdude> ehhm i think that looks quite strange
[09:29:50] <kbni-air> well you really want to insert stuff after whatever is in the middle of the li already, right?
[09:30:37] <evlh> kbni-air, what's happening exactly on mobile browsers? looks fine on my iphone.
[09:30:57] <kbni-air> evlh: when I click on one of the links, it tries to GET /http://fullurl/asdasd
[09:31:04] <kbni-air> instead of opening a connection to fullurl and GET /asdasd
[09:31:15] <kbni-air> on mozilla, it actually tries to GET /{url}
[09:31:31] <kbni-air> do the links work in safari mobile?
[09:32:57] <evlh> they do, just tried 5 different links..
[09:33:03] <kbni-air> hmmm
[09:33:12] <kbni-air> so this must be an android webkit limitation?
[09:33:23] <evlh> the jquery you wrote is right, that's why I'm stumped.
[09:33:24] <evlh> lol
[09:33:28] <kbni-air> yup
[09:33:31] <kbni-air> everything works nicely
[09:33:49] <kbni-air> i thought I had done everything pretty nicely too I might add, heh.
[09:34:18] <kbni-air> evlh: is there a way I can get a ('div.item:first').html(), but including the <div blah></div>?
[09:35:27] <evlh> Ah, wait.
[09:35:33] <kbni-air> wait!?
[09:35:39] <evlh> Firefox doesn't like your links.
[09:35:42] <kbni-air> you noticed it too?
[09:35:44] <kbni-air> !!
[09:35:53] <kbni-air> I'm blaming wbekit mobile on this one
[09:35:57] <evlh> it's so stupid. Safari worked just fine, but firefox noped.
[09:36:05] <kbni-air> wait, safari is webkit too
[09:36:14] <evlh> yeah, so it's not a webkit issue
[09:36:21] <kbni-air> but apple's fancy webkit.. isn't it?
[09:36:35] <evlh> yes, but webkit is webkit. I'm looking at your jquery again
[09:36:43] <evlh> but infirefox, I'm getting the actual outputted links as {url}
[09:36:46] <kbni-air> waht did firefox do with the link?
[09:36:49] <kbni-air> aaah yeah
[09:36:54] <kbni-air> but the display is just fine, right? lol
[09:36:58] <evlh> and {subreddit}
[09:37:02] <evlh> oh yeah, display is perfect
[09:37:14] <kbni-air> thought it was a rather clever solution I had there
[09:37:18] <kbni-air> there's always a catch... lol
[09:38:01] <evlh> Lol. Your socket.io js is erroring out on page load.
[09:38:18] <kbni-air> oh really?
[09:38:26] <kbni-air> on what platform?
[09:38:32] <evlh> Not sure if it's causing any breaking points, but your connection is getting interrupted while the page is loading
[09:38:36] <kbni-air> I have only really tested in chrome if I am perfectly honest
[09:39:09] <kbni-air> socket io is like the last thing that is done... hmm
[09:39:27] <evlh> Firefox 13, so gecko
[09:39:35] <kbni-air> evlh: is that mobile?
[09:39:42] <evlh> nope
[09:39:59] <kbni-air> ooooh crap
[09:40:02] <kbni-air> the links in firefox are bad too
[09:40:07] <kbni-air> like, firefox desktop
[09:40:13] <kbni-air> I had only tested chrome on the desktop
[09:40:19] <evlh> It's truly strange, on my PC, the links in firefox are outputting wrong, but on my iPhone, links are fine
[09:40:19] <evlh> lol
[09:40:29] <kbni-air> if you try chrome it will work fine too
[09:40:33] <evlh> Hm
[09:40:45] <kbni-air> I think it might be because it doesn't actually have it's own dom nodes or something?
[09:40:57] <kbni-air> so it's just using the original hyperlink that was at that location?
[09:41:00] <kbni-air> (does that make sense?)
[09:41:59] <evlh> Hmm.
[09:42:17] <kbni-air> this is good actually, it means I may be able to resolve this issue by testing with firefox on desktop instead of just mobile browsers
[09:42:20] <kbni-air> huzzah
[09:43:12] <evlh> So on the droid, links break, but on Chrome, they don't... but on the iPhone, links are fine, but in firefox, they're fine
[09:43:46] <kbni-air> i think I need a proper way to accomplish my templating
[09:44:15] <evlh> repeat that last line, my IRC auto /cleared lol
[09:44:29] <kbni-air> i think I need a proper way to accomplish my templating
[09:44:43] <kbni-air> simply chucking html in there is obviously not healthy
[09:45:00] <evlh> it's all experimental though, it isn't bad
[09:45:17] <kbni-air> sure, but i would like this to work in firefox/chrome
[09:49:02] <evlh> lol.  the only thing that's striking me as odd is that connection being interrupted on page load error that I'm seeing on firefox
[09:49:45] <evlh> The connection was interrupted while the page was loading. Source File: http://re.jit.su/socket.io/socket.io.js Line: 2322 ^^
[09:50:21] <dapingwing> hey , how do you convert a table on a remote webpage and send it to mysql DB ?
[09:50:22] <kbni-air> ..and the link thing :P
[09:51:01] <evlh> well, I'm wondering if it's causing a breakpoint, which is stopping jquery from modifying the links
[09:51:18] <kbni-air> it doesn't occur for me locally
[09:52:06] <kbni-air> hm
[09:52:09] <kbni-air> actually yes it does
[09:52:38] <kbni-air> oh
[09:52:41] <kbni-air> that is from refreshing evlh
[09:52:52] <evlh> also -- I'm afriad of being on the page while at work because it's not https, and the sockets are requesting nsfw links.
[09:52:53] <evlh> lol
[09:53:10] <kbni-air> evlh: the nsfw links should be filtered in the default config
[09:53:27] <kbni-air> evlh: and also the nsfw links are transported hopefully over websockets
[09:53:32] <evlh> just saw two items for /r/cityporn figured that was ... eek.
[09:53:33] <kbni-air> but yeah I guess that's a super valid concern :/
[09:53:44] <kbni-air> nah, cityporn is just pictures of beautiful cities
[09:53:46] <evlh> oh
[09:53:57] <evlh> see I'm stupid, just saw a word and immediately thought 'uh oh'
[09:53:58] <evlh> lol
[09:54:18] <kbni-air> heh, understandable.
[09:54:19] <evlh> One sec though, i'm still looking at the jquery to see if there's a better way to do it
[09:54:26] <kbni-air> thanks
[09:54:34] <kbni-air> i've actually gone and broke it completely on my end in the mean time
[09:54:36] <kbni-air> I'm awesome like that
[09:55:28] <harald__> hey, I'm strugeling with some basic form stuff - how can I make .submit() listen get into the context of the correct <form> when there are many?
[09:55:31] <harald__> http://pastebin.com/7RQnYz76
[09:55:51] <dapingwing> hey , how do you convert a table on a remote webpage and send it to mysql DB ?
[09:56:35] <kbni-air> harald__: give your forms names or ids
[09:57:00] <kbni-air> then you can do $('form#someID').submit(..) or $('form[name="someName"]').submit(..)
[09:57:57] <harald__> kbni-air: okay, but wouldn't that force me to hard code the ID into the JavaScript? (have one JS function per form?)
[09:58:16] <Jagan_> hi..
[09:58:51] <kbni-air> well yeah
[09:58:57] <kbni-air> how else do you want it to know what context you are in?
[09:59:23] <kbni-air> do you plan on using if-than-else in a single function to do different things?
[09:59:27] <harald__> isn't it possible to pass it along as a parameter or something?
[10:00:23] <Jagan_> I want to use recaptcha signup? I don have any website to get public key from google. is there any other way to get recaptcha?
[10:00:38] <dapingwing> look for another captcha provider
[10:00:43] <dapingwing> there are loads out there
[10:01:03] <kbni-air> harald__: oh, check out this (and this.id) in your function
[10:01:06] <harald__> kbni-air: there will be hundreds of <form>'s - so I don't want separate JS functions for each...
[10:03:12] <kbni-air> evlh: I think it's because at some point when the HTML is added, it is escaped
[10:03:26] <harald__> kbni-air: yeah, let me work on that
[10:03:35] <harald__> thx for now
[10:03:48] <kbni-air> (going by firebug, the html source of the page is being escaped if they are in hrefs <a href="http://ww.reddit.com/r/%7Bsubreddit%7D">r/funny</a>
[10:06:30] <kbni-air> evlh: aha! $('div.item:first')[0].outerHTML
[10:06:42] <evlh> oh strange is that crap.
[10:06:53] <kbni-air> in chrome that returns the html verbatm, in firefox the {}s are escaped
[10:07:24] <evlh> How*
[10:07:24] <evlh> lol
[10:07:39] <evlh> I was looking at firefox with a puzzled face for 10 minutes
[10:08:22] <dapingwing> hey , how do you convert a table on a remote webpage and send it to mysql DB ?
[10:08:28] <kbni-air> that is super weird
[10:08:46] <evlh> the {}'s are escaping when they're inside of an a href only though? Because {title} is working, {date_posted} is working
[10:09:06] <kbni-air> well
[10:09:14] <kbni-air> I'd imagine any special characters inside a href would work
[10:09:33] <kbni-air> I'd imagine any special characters inside a href would be escaped
[10:09:47] <evlh> You should try and see if having it output {url} as a span (<span>{url}</span>) would actually display the URL
[10:14:44] <evlh> Firefox and Droid Mobile might ignore special characters inside an href
[10:15:44] <evlh> Ah, try something like..
[10:15:55] <evlh> <a href={url}>{title}</a> posted to
[10:16:16] <evlh> Instead of having it inside quotes, just to see if firefox handles it differently
[10:16:41] <kbni-air> hang on evlh.. my firefox is having a meltdown
[10:17:47] <kbni-air> evlh: no... it's only if it's in quotes
[10:18:30] <kbni-air> and only if it's a href tag
[10:18:57] <kbni-air> I added a <span data-url="{url}" href="{url}">{url}</span> and only the href= one was buggered
[10:19:01] <rethus> i have an inpuit-field, and set the value of it with $('#filterName').val("test 1234");
[10:19:24] <rethus> the input insn't change.. but if i do $('#filterName').val(); , i got test 123
[10:19:47] <rethus> why the value-changes are not visible for the input-field?
[10:20:44] <evlh> You could just add an onClick="window.open('{url}');" on the a tag
[10:21:09] <evlh> and remove the href altogether. Most browsers will handle window.open just fine.
[10:21:47] <evlh> Won't validate as proper HTML, but neither does Google. And as long as it functions, that's all that matters.
[10:22:38] <evlh> (and doing the same to both the subreddit, and the title a tags.)
[10:24:31] <CyberMaN> why would serialize() have any problem with the form being inside a table?
[10:24:54] <johnkpaul> CyberMaN: it should not, what is the problem you're having
[10:28:07] <kbni-air> evlh: I just added add = add.replaceAll('%7B'+prop+'%7D', thing[prop]);
[10:28:24] <kbni-air> I will use $('div.item a').click() to handle the links on mobile platforms though
[10:29:07] <kbni-air> what a truly bizare problem
[10:29:08] <kbni-air> lol
[10:29:56] <kbni-air> evlh: also interesting to note is that javascript: links do not get touched
[10:30:16] <kbni-air> so the href="javascript:func({id})" is a-ok, but href="{id}" is not
[10:30:16] <kbni-air> lol
[10:31:43] <CyberMaN> ok scratch that last
[10:31:47] <CyberMaN> if alert(data) prints 1
[10:31:59] <CyberMaN> why would data == "1" return false?
[10:32:25] <BillCriswell> CyberMaN: Sure you aren't doing === ?
[10:32:32] <BillCriswell> Be careful of "1" vs 1
[10:32:44] <CyberMaN> it's a return from another page
[10:32:50] <CyberMaN> I thought i'd be "1" defacto
[10:32:55] <CyberMaN> it'd*
[10:33:29] <BillCriswell> data == "1" should not be returning false. There's something else going wrong.
[10:33:38] <CyberMaN> nope, that was it
[10:33:39] <CyberMaN> 1 worked
[10:33:41] <CyberMaN> "1" didn't
[10:33:49] <CyberMaN> thanks for the idea
[10:34:22] <BillCriswell> data == "1" will work with "1" or 1 though.
[10:37:00] <kbni-air> evlh: well, I've pushedd my changes to http://re.jit.su - since you can browse at work maybe you can set yourself up some filters and give it a go? :P
[10:37:33] <evlh> Worked!
[10:37:49] <evlh> what'd you do differently
[10:38:14] <kbni-air> evlh: I just added add = add.replaceAll('%7B'+prop+'%7D', thing[prop]);
[10:38:25] <evlh> Aha.
[10:38:34] <evlh> See, I was going to take the easy route out
[10:38:39] <evlh> sorry for being lazy

[10:40:20] <kbni-air> much appreciated! :)
[10:40:53] <Azra-el> i have div id=myid > div > div > div.myclass   ... how can i select the last id ?
[10:42:25] <johnkpaul> Azra-el: the last id?
[10:42:30] <BillCriswell> Azra-el: You want myid?
[10:42:33] <Azra-el> the last div sorry
[10:43:00] <johnkpaul> Azra-el: are there other .myclass divs inside #myid?
[10:43:15] <BillCriswell> Azra-el: $('.myclass').closest('div[id]'); maybe?
[10:43:26] <Azra-el> no ... would $('#myid > .myclass') work ? and no .. there's only one myclass div
[10:43:43] <BillCriswell> $('.myclass').closest('div[id]').attr('id') I mean... Think that's what you want.
[10:44:33] <johnkpaul> Azra-el: if there is only one, just select .myclass
[10:44:42] <johnkpaul> $(.myclass')
[10:44:54] <BillCriswell> Yeah don't think I'm following the problem. =)
[10:45:01] <johnkpaul> why do you need to ensure that it is under #myid if there's only one?
[10:45:11] <johnkpaul> BillCriswell: :) but that's definitely a solution for a problem we don't know
[10:45:25] <BillCriswell> I'm full of those!
[10:45:46] <Azra-el> ok.. let me rephrase.. im so tired so i might be just acting like an idiot .. div1(has id=myid) > div2 > div3(has class=myclass) .. there are more then one myclass div in the whole document but i need to react to an event on mydiv . and select THE div with .myclass that it contains .. not others
[10:46:09] <Azra-el> maybe i made myself clear now .. sorry .. and i was thinking if $('.myclass > #myid') would work
[10:46:24] <johnkpaul> Azra-el: so inside the event handler, $(this).find(".myclass")
[10:46:26] <BillCriswell> I'm actually more confused.
[10:46:53] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @ Azra-el
[10:47:41] <Azra-el> http://i.imgur.com/zMA5Y.png
[10:47:45] <Azra-el> maybe this makes more sense?
[10:48:08] <johnkpaul> hm, not really
[10:48:48] <Azra-el> http://i.imgur.com/cCcR7.png
[10:49:25] <johnkpaul> Azra-el: what do you mean "select this"
[10:49:27] <johnkpaul> how do you select a div?
[10:49:40] <BillCriswell> https://gist.github.com/4d77faad3c9cc02efbc6 Azra-el: Maybe?
[10:52:51] <BillCriswell> Wait... it would trigger than click anyway. Do you want to stop the bubbling or something?
[10:53:41] <digs> So, I have the jquery ui datepicker implemented on my site however it 2 times larger than the example on http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#min-max
[10:53:57] <digs> What do I need to set or do for the size?
[10:55:25] <Azra-el> sorry.... i was jsfidleing :) http://jsfiddle.net/Re6rN/1/
[10:55:49] <BillCriswell> Oh duh.
[10:56:15] <BillCriswell> You want the event target.
[10:56:38] <johnkpaul> digs: are you using the jquery ui's css file unchanged?
[10:57:10] <Azra-el> BillCriswell  i want to click on a top level div and then modify or whatever the html content of the category_qty child of only that particular div
[10:57:31] <BillCriswell> Azra-el: You want to do like... $('.parent').on('click', function(e){ var $target = $(e.target); });
[10:57:34] <Azra-el> its not really binded on click but i can inffer from that
[10:58:25] <BillCriswell> Azra-el: http://api.jquery.com/event.target/
[10:59:26] <Azra-el> nope thats not it ... i think i might need some sleep since i cant even explain myself.. just silly :(
[10:59:44] <digs> johnkpaul yes.
[11:00:06] <BillCriswell> Yeah. If I go to sleep unable to figure something out I usually get it within 3 minutes in the morninig.
[11:00:18] <BillCriswell> Sleep does some awesome stuff.
[11:01:34] <Azra-el> BillCriswell .. last try ... after that ill just sleep =))
[11:01:34] <Azra-el> http://jsfiddle.net/Re6rN/2/
[11:01:36] <johnkpaul> digs: then I don't know
[11:01:45] <digs> okay

[11:05:23] <Tobsn> any devs from poland here who are looking for a fulltime job in krakow? :)
[11:05:31] <shoky> or shall i say http://jqfiddle.net
[11:05:45] <snover> no you shallnâ€™t
[11:05:49] <shoky> ;<
[11:06:22] <johnkpaul> jqfiddle.net! wow that's so much better than my bookmarklet
[11:06:28] <johnkpaul> chrome extension rather
[11:06:29] <shoky> ;>
[11:08:47] <Azra-el> BillCriswell this is what i actually needed it for :) http://jsfiddle.net/Re6rN/4/ maybe its naive but its the best idea i got :)
[11:09:21] <zoite> How can I use jquery-expander on newly created elements? I tried adding it to .live() and it still didn't work
[11:09:56] <BillCriswell> Azra-el: http://jsfiddle.net/Re6rN/5/
[11:10:30] <shoky> zoite: what do you mean you added it to .live() ?
[11:11:06] <BillCriswell> Azra-el: So you really just need http://jsfiddle.net/Re6rN/6/
[11:11:11] <zoite> http://jsfiddle.net/xbENM/ - You can see it live on http://events.fliptune.org
[11:11:27] <zoite> I can't get the [read more] link to show up on new elements after I click the 'More' button
[11:12:14] <shoky> you'd need to call .expander on those new elements after they're added, i suppose
[11:12:25] <shoky> don't see what .live() has to do with ti
[11:12:26] <shoky> it
[11:12:59] <johnkpaul> zoite: live only works with native browser events, not jquery plugins. .click() is handled very differently than .expandor()
[11:12:59] <zoite> I tried adding it after the .append($data) in $('#more_button').live('click'
[11:13:04] <alfik> dasda
[11:13:27] <zoite> hm, ok. So how could I call it on the new elements?
[11:13:45] <shoky> wait, after the .append($data) it should work
[11:14:18] <shoky> something like:  $('dl').append(data).find('dd').expander(.....)
[11:14:21] <shoky> $data
[11:14:40] <shoky> hmm that would also call it again for the old dd's though
[11:14:49] <shoky> anyway you get the gist
[11:16:12] <shoky> i guess:  $(data).appendTo('dl').find('dd').expander(....)
[11:18:27] <shoky> heh wtf is 'widow'
[11:18:30] <zoite> I tried both of those and they don't appear to be working  unfortunately
[11:18:36] <Azra-el> thanks again BillCriswell
[11:18:44] <shoky> zoite: can you show it..
[11:18:51] <BillCriswell> Azra-el: No problem
[11:18:57] <shoky> "it doesnt work" doesnt help
[11:19:10] <zoite> yes, it's on http://events.fliptune.org
[11:19:21] <gdoron> Hi all.
[11:19:36] <shoky> zoite: you appended twice..
[11:19:53] <shoky> zoite: do only:  $(data).appendTo('dl').find('dd').expander(....)
[11:20:00] <shoky> zoite: also you didn't give it any options this time ?
[11:20:03] <shoky> gdoron: shalom
[11:20:15] <zoite> Without options it should still work, it will just use default values
[11:20:20] <zoite> I've updated it
[11:20:35] <gdoron> ×”×›×œ ×˜×•×‘ ×©×•×§×™?
[11:20:59] <shoky> zoite: and it works
[11:21:09] <zoite> hm?
[11:21:13] <shoky> gdoron: yup
[11:21:22] <alfik> guys how i can make this slower ? $('#login-box').hide().fadeIn('slow');         its too fast :/
[11:21:23] <shoky> zoite: default values, remember...
[11:21:58] <shoky> zoite: either that or the data you're appending is not long enough anyway..
[11:22:17] <alfik> ?
[11:22:27] <shoky> alfik: instead of 'slow' you can put a number of milliseconds
[11:23:14] <zoite> I've updated it with the options but still don't see a read more link
[11:23:31] <shoky> zoite: why would you?
[11:23:36] <shoky> the text is short
[11:23:53] <zoite> Some are, but some are much longer
[11:24:02] <shoky> but they show with  '...'
[11:24:17] <shoky> are you sure that you're appending the full text?
[11:24:18] <gdoron_> I got disconnected from so unknown reason
[11:24:39] <zoite> oh my ....
[11:24:42] <alfik> shoky btw when i use it its loading site while its fadein .. how i can make it like ajax that it no show loading page ?
[11:24:46] <gdoron_> How do I write for a particular user?
[11:24:52] <zoite> I forgot I shortened it in my php script. How embarrassing
[11:24:57] <gdoron_> Bold and read stuff?
[11:24:58] <shoky> gdoron_: what do u mean?
[11:25:05] <shoky> for a user ?
[11:25:05] <gdoron_> This!
[11:25:10] <shoky> what user?
[11:25:28] <gdoron_> Lets you.
[11:25:30] <shoky> javascript/jquery has no notion of users
[11:25:30] <gdoron_> how do you address me personally?
[11:25:39] <shoky> i say: hi doron, ma nishma
[11:25:40] <shoky> for example.
[11:25:42] <gdoron_> *let's say
[11:25:50] <shoky> you are asking illogical questions
[11:25:59] <gdoron_> :)
[11:26:00] <zoite> Thank you for your help, shoky. It's working flawlessly now :)
[11:26:05] <shoky> np zoite ;]
[11:26:07] <gdoron_> And the red text thing?
[11:26:19] <shoky> gdoron_: you can change text color with CSS
[11:27:30] <digs> shoky or johnkpaul -- http://jsfiddle.net/NTX8X/
[11:27:37] <digs> Sorry I didn't see your request until now.

[11:29:09] <gf3> I have only been on IRC for fifteen years
[11:29:12] <gdoron_> Ohhh,
[11:29:21] <codacoder> actually, make that since '95... 17 yrs!
[11:29:28] <shoky> do BBSs count :\
[11:29:30] <johnkpaul> digs: they have changed css
[11:29:37] <codacoder> funny gf3
[11:29:38] <gdoron_> I don't have any client - chrome...
[11:29:40] <johnkpaul> digs: http://jqueryui.com/demos/demos.css
[11:29:42] <gf3> shoky: No, sorry, BBS' do not count as IRC
[11:29:47] <codacoder> using trillian here

[11:30:24] <codacoder> cuz?
[11:30:36] <gdoron_> Anyway, I thought you might be interested reading the conclusion of out chat that other day.
[11:30:37] <gdoron_> http://stackoverflow.com/q/10753306/601179
[11:30:43] <shoky> gdoron_ if you're on the webchat thingy then i dont think you can change colrs
[11:30:44] <Log1x> >trillian
[11:30:44] <Log1x> >2012
[11:30:45] <gf3> There aren't any proper IRC clients for windows, codacoder
[11:30:58] <codacoder> define proper
[11:31:01] <Log1x> yeah please define proper
[11:31:11] <gf3> codacoder: Unless of course you go all CYGWIN and run weechat or something
[11:31:16] <digs> johnkpaul, so that is the 'current' ui css ?
[11:31:28] <digs> for the demos.
[11:31:29] <gdoron_> My text is dark as the night... :(
[11:31:32] <alfik> guys how i can slide from up to down someting ?
[11:31:38] <johnkpaul> digs: what do you mean "current"?
[11:32:05] <digs> I realize that was an error... that link you gave me is what css?
[11:32:27] <codacoder> gf3: how about ubuntu clients?
[11:32:34] <johnkpaul> the extra css in that demo that is not in the css distrubution with jquery ui, digs
[11:32:49] <digs> ahhhh thanks johnkpaul
[11:32:52] <digs> :)
[11:32:55] <gf3> codacoder: Well in that case you have the wealth of rock-solid CLI clients available to you
[11:33:03] <gdoron_> $('').slideDown();
[11:33:04] <gf3> codacoder: But still a lack of nice GUI clients
[11:33:05] <NoiseEee> gdoron_: whatever irc client you are using (or extension, etc) im sure is configurable
[11:33:17] <gf3> NoiseEee: Unlikely
[11:33:21] <digs> beautiful.
[11:33:22] <gf3> UNHEARD OF
[11:33:25] <johnkpaul> digs: no problem
[11:33:30] <gdoron_> I'm using chrome... webchat.
[11:33:41] <gdoron_> shoky, are you with me?
[11:33:43] <shoky> mIRC has served me well through the ages
[11:33:50] <shoky> gdoron_: regarding?
[11:34:23] <alfik> when i use SlideDown why it comes from the left up ? why i can just do from up to down .. ?
[11:34:32] <codacoder> all: I stopped "getting religion" over software and platforms a loooong time ago
[11:34:33] <gdoron_> If you got comments about how I summed the conversion that other day, please comment at Stack overflow.

[11:35:08] <gf3> codacoder: I don't consider myself a Mac fanboi, but for whatever reason no one has made anything that can touch the likes of Textual or Linkinus

[11:35:11] <gf3> codacoder: http://conceitedsoftware.com/products/linkinus
[11:35:16] <shoky> gdoron_: as far as im concerned the issue was concluded as soon as ajpiano had his say. i couldnt care less what SO has to say about it ;)
[11:35:33] <codacoder> gf3: thanks
[11:35:45] <codacoder> going back to lurk status ;)
[11:36:01] <gdoron_> :), Don't you want to spread the knowledge? no one reads the IRC chat logs you know...
[11:36:16] <shoky> it's not an important issue..
[11:36:27] <gdoron_> O.K. ×¨×•×ª ×¡×•×£
[11:36:41] <shoky> it's maybe the least important issue ever asked about ;P
[11:36:48] <shoky> and you're still dwelling on it :P
[11:37:03] <gdoron_> gotta go anyway, Thinking about some other unimportant issue...

[11:38:42] <shoky> bye habub
[11:39:07] <shoky> weird israelis..
[11:45:37] <alfik> how i can use .one with document ready ?
[11:51:50] <alfik> guys can anyone help me please ? http://fresharea.net/ look at the left top img the triangle .. why it slide down from left up to rightdown ? why it just can,t slide from up to down ..
[11:53:26] <codacoder> alfik: it's not sliding at all AFAICT.  You're animating height/width UIMM
[11:53:57] <alfik> codacoder aha so there is no way . ?
[11:54:16] <codacoder> sure- try negative top (same as it's height)
[11:54:30] <antnash> Hey. Would there be a quick way of passing all values of the selects matching $('#dialogdiv select') to an array, rather than using .each(function() { array.push(); }) ?
[11:54:40] <alfik> codecoder how i can do it .. that width stay 200px but height will be changed ?
[11:55:35] <codacoder> alfik: no - dont chsange the height or width.  If you know the height, make the top coord that same number and make it negative
[11:55:48] <codacoder> then slide it down
[11:56:32] <alfik> codacoder :( sry i dont understand you now .. ye my header is 120px height .
[11:56:45] <codacoder> alfik: understand that it's OFF SCREEN at the start.  Off screen by the same amount as its height.  See?
[11:57:10] <codacoder> alfik: so make it psition:fixed
[11:57:53] <alfik> codacoder i can do it in jquery becuase what is when some lame guys has set off the javascript at browser.
[11:58:25] <sanova> hi
[11:58:32] <codacoder> alfik: sorry - I couln't parse that :/
[11:58:42] <antnash> codacoder: That would happen if you .slide(), wouldn't it? the image is scaling up with the size of the container, no?
[11:59:10] <alfik> codacoder np ... i tryed position fixed at my img and its still load like it was loading .
[11:59:22] <alfik> codacoder i mean sliding * no loading.
[11:59:45] <codacoder> antnash: If I understood him correctly, he wants it to slide, not "expand" from top left to bottom right
[11:59:46] <sanova> is possible refresh datatable after adding or updating data into table without reload page ?
[12:00:10] <sanova> to refresh*
[12:01:28] <codacoder> sanova: define datatable (there are so many out there)
[12:01:40] <antnash> codacoder: Yeah, so use CSS3 animation, rather than just javascript. Set the initial location as off screen, then add a ready class when the DOM os loaded, which slides it on screen
[12:02:06] <codacoder> antnash: yep
[12:02:44] <antnash> codacoder: Don't suppose you know about my question, do you?
[12:02:53] <antnash> Would there be a quick way of passing all values of the selects matching $('#dialogdiv select') to an array, rather than using .each(function() { array.push(); }) ?
[12:02:57] <codacoder> sorry - musta missed it
[12:03:14] <codacoder> sec...
[12:04:14] <alfik> codacoder k works now $('#main-logo').hide().slideDown(3000);     how i can make here a delay and a css width:187px ?
[12:06:09] <sanova> codacoder: $('#table').datatable({...."sAjaxSource": '../file.asp' ...}) . is there some function to reload data calling again ajax request
[12:06:10] <sanova> ?
[12:06:21] <DukeDrake> hi
[12:06:56] <DukeDrake> how can I select elements with a certain value="" ?
[12:07:37] <codacoder> antnash: was hoping there was something like the opposite of .serializeArray for a select - cant' find it tho
[12:08:10] <NoiseEee> DukeDrake: $('[value=""]')
[12:08:17] <antnash> codacoder: So it's just gotta be push to array then? It's not a big deal, there's never really gonna be more than 10 or so
[12:08:36] <DukeDrake> NoiseEee: hm!! ah, get it =)
[12:08:37] <DukeDrake> thanx
[12:08:41] <alfik> codacoder ?
[12:08:51] <TylerWhitney> I have a div with text that is populated from a place I have no control of. I want to use jquery to replace only a certain phrase in that div. I was looking at .replaceWith but I think thats wrong, does anybody have any suggestions?
[12:08:56] <_ramok> hi
[12:09:23] <DukeDrake> NoiseEee: mh ... and now only elements with a certain value which have the attribute 'checked' ? =)
[12:09:49] <codacoder> sanova:that's the datatables plugin from datatables.net right?
[12:09:56] <_ramok> with this regexp /^(.+&host=)([\w\.]+)(&.*)?$/  i'm not able to identify "-" in a string, so something like host=my-server.com would not be recognized. what do i need to add so that  ibhost-my-server.com is recognized?
[12:10:59] <DukeDrake> filter(":checked"). ?
[12:11:03] <codacoder> antnash: sorry got distracted.  Yess it sounds as tho that's the only way.  Seems dumb to doesn't it?
[12:11:19] <alfik> why this dont work fu ck .css("width":"187px","position":"fixed")
[12:11:28] <antnash> codacoder: Yeah, it seems like such a natural thing to want to do.
[12:12:00] <NoiseEee> _ramok: basic regex.  a dash needs to be the first or last item in your selector.  [-\w\.]+
[12:12:05] <DukeDrake> ok, works ^^
[12:12:24] <codacoder> antnash: or select.stringify or whatever
[12:12:38] <codacoder> there must be something we're missing...
[12:12:50] <_ramok> NoiseEee: but would then ibhost=www.myserver.com work too?
[12:13:09] <NoiseEee> _ramok: test!
[12:13:28] <whateverb> Why can't I get current week's monday(first day of the current week) and sunday(last day of the current week) here: http://jsfiddle.net/H2uzj/
[12:18:27] <codacoder> antnash: whatabout $.makeArray with a suitable filter?
[12:19:16] <antnash> codacoder: I'll have a look at it, ta. Just realised that I need to do some more processing on them though.
[12:19:44] <codacoder> k
[12:20:04] <codacoder> is anyone here sh!thot with deferreds/when etc?
[12:20:23] <evlh> what is shithot
[12:20:54] <codacoder> shithot - definition:  anyine who is better than me :)
[12:21:10] <Azra-el> ummm i have some nested divs ... but i am adding the click event only to the outer container div... but when i do console.log(event.this) i get one of the inner divs ... what gives
[12:21:28] <NoiseEee> Azra-el: google "event bubbling"
[12:24:09] <Azra-el> NoiseEee . .shall i mention that i actually want to get the id of the outer div .. and i get in return the inner div?
[12:26:15] <shoky> codacoder: just ask
[12:27:11] <codacoder> shoky: sec...
[12:27:12] <NoiseEee> Azra-el: you need to understand how event bubbling works.  what you describe is perfectly normal.
[12:27:31] <Azra-el> ill make a jsfiddle to understand it better
[12:28:35] <alfik> lol help me
[12:28:41] <alfik> why this is only doing 2 divs http://jsfiddle.net/PgPtX/
[12:29:11] <shoky> alfik: .css( {width:'187px', position: 'fixed'} )
[12:29:16] <andr0id1> guys, i have several objects that i need to iterate through in a ajax call so i can get the matching ones and do the autocomplete. so far, i have this:  success: function( data ) { response( [ { value: '1', label:'1'}, { value: '2', label: '2'} ]); } . how to go through all of the objects? i really dont have any idea...
[12:29:42] <alfik> shoky ty this i have fixed but look my jsfiddle
[12:29:45] <shoky> alfik: check your code............
[12:30:06] <_ramok> should console.log even work with ajax calls?
[12:30:10] <shoky> hmm i wonder why #3 is not fading in HMMM
[12:30:11] <species> alfik: ill give you a clue: what comes after #2?
[12:30:26] <shoky> _ramok: it has nothing to do with ajax calls. it should work anytime
[12:30:26] <kollapse> Hello. Doesn't jQuery support UTF-8 selectors ? I can use $('#some_id') but using $('#some%20id%20ÄƒÃ®ÅŸÅ£') always returns null (!!)
[12:30:38] <nzlad> apologies upfront as I am still coming to grips with JQuery (in Yii), but I am looking for some assistance to complete a modal dialog confirmation event http://pastebin.com/Et6ZPwEV much appreciated
[12:30:39] <alfik> species there are missing some {} etc ?
[12:30:41] <species> shit I forgot to put too much sugar in my tea
[12:30:48] <philcrissman> alfik: read your code again. :)
[12:30:56] <species> alfik: look closer at the number, or you'll continue to feel dumber
[12:31:12] <species> i could give it away, but you'll learn nothing that way
[12:32:08] <alfik> ahahahaha lol
[12:32:12] <alfik> #2 -> #3
[12:32:16] <alfik> fu cking pc
[12:32:19] <Azra-el> NoiseEee .. ok so here it is http://jsfiddle.net/rXa8n/1/
[12:32:20] <andr0id1> can anyone help me with my problem?
[12:32:38] <shoky> right, blame the pc
[12:32:41] <philcrissman> alfik: the pc did it!
[12:33:37] <andr0id1> anyone?
[12:33:39] <shoky> andr0id1: donno what you're doing in that success handler, but maybe you're looking for $.each ?
[12:33:40] <BillCriswell> Azra-el: You can just use $(this) inside. $(this) is .outercontainer...
[12:34:12] <codacoder> shoky: I'm looking at the very last example in this blog post: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[12:34:20] <species> alfik: you solved it yourself, by changing it to #3, in future dont copy and paste, no need to thank me
[12:34:24] <andr0id1> shoky, let me send a pastebin
[12:35:03] <alfik> btw guys your eyes are not burned up by pc ? cuz my every day ... :/ wtf ?
[12:35:04] <codacoder> shoky: and in the comments someone called Jusitn (not a typo) asked a question and poster did this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/MU3Rq/
[12:35:14] <tw2113> burned up by pc?
[12:35:24] <andr0id1> shoky, http://pastebin.com/tUe2qxdp
[12:35:37] <andr0id1> its the autocomplete jquery
[12:35:42] <codacoder> shoky: I want to do something similar but... well, different ;)
[12:36:05] <species> can I stop using rhyming couplets now
[12:36:52] <codacoder> my "returns" are script elements that are injected and via doc.ready call a fixed outer-window function (four of them)
[12:37:20] <codacoder> so Q is... how to make them somehow complete the promise?
[12:37:48] <shoky> didnt understand that last line ;p
[12:37:49] <codacoder> if you can understand that garbled trash I'll be amazed ;)
[12:37:55] <codacoder> LOL
[12:38:02] <andr0id1> shoky, any idea on my pastebin?
[12:38:12] <shoky> andr0id1 sry i dont really know autocomplete
[12:38:29] <shoky> so i donno what that response(...) is.. response is a callback?
[12:38:42] <codacoder> shoky: you understand the idea of injected scipt elements, right?
[12:38:45] <andr0id1> no, my problem is how to iterate through the objects
[12:38:53] <shoky> codacoder: i think so
[12:39:10] <codacoder> each has a doc.ready handler...
[12:39:11] <shoky> but didnt understand the fixed outer-window function..
[12:39:15] <BillCriswell> codacoder: You switch over to 2?
[12:39:17] <shoky> they do?
[12:39:23] <codacoder> each calls something in the outer window...
[12:39:28] <codacoder> that's fine... that works
[12:39:57] <codacoder> how do I get them to complete a promise?
[12:40:05] <Azra-el> BillCriswell ... thats what i did .. but in my live code it didnt work
[12:40:13] <codacoder> so that the original when is satisfied?
[12:40:39] <shoky> what original when?
[12:41:00] <Azra-el> BillCriswell.. and now it works.. wow... wtf
[12:41:23] <codacoder> shoky: the injection code is wrapped in $.when
[12:41:49] <shoky> but do the injections themselves return promises?
[12:41:49] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/rXa8n/2/
[12:41:58] <BillCriswell> Azra-el: Happens. Probably a silly error.
[12:42:02] <codacoder> shoky
[12:42:08] <codacoder> oops ;)
[12:42:13] <shoky> heh
[12:42:25] <codacoder> shoky: THAT is the problem <- how to do exactly that
[12:42:32] <shoky> how are you injecting?
[12:42:55] <codacoder> modifying the doc in in iframe
[12:43:05] <shoky> you'd need to create a new $.Deferred() for each of them
[12:43:21] <codacoder> once browser has parsed the scripts, the jQ doc.ready runs
[12:43:23] <shoky> to be .resolve()'d in their doc.ready that you mentioned
[12:43:36] <codacoder> ouch
[12:43:44] <shoky> just like that fiddle does
[12:43:45] <codacoder> cross frame deferred?
[12:43:57] <codacoder> sounds scary
[12:43:58] <shoky> oh its cross frame.......
[12:44:00] <alfik> guys how i can make that this will run only once at the beginning ? http://jsfiddle.net/ugtBe/       cuz its nerf when it doing every time ...
[12:44:02] <codacoder> RIGHT
[12:44:03] <shoky> now i understand the outer-window...
[12:44:10] <codacoder> sorry
[12:44:16] <codacoder> shoulda made that clearer
[12:44:25] <codacoder> so...
[12:44:26] <shoky> mmm
[12:44:44] <shoky> same deal though i guess
[12:44:46] <codacoder> the injected scripts call the outer window to announce they're ready...
[12:44:51] <Azra-el> BillCriswell ... the lords of js work in misterious ways i guess
[12:44:52] <codacoder> one at a time...
[12:44:54] <shoky> ah
[12:45:06] <codacoder> when all are ready somehow complete the promise (is the problem)
[12:45:19] <shoky> so in the outer window create the seperate deferreds
[12:45:28] <codacoder> yep
[12:45:39] <shoky> and when each one announces they're ready, resolve it's deferred
[12:45:47] <shoky> its
[12:45:54] <codacoder> put the deferreds where tho?
[12:46:15] <codacoder> not hanging of global/window (that is known to kill small children)
[12:46:19] <shoky> in that outer window? dont really know your page(s) structure
[12:46:47] <shoky> the other frames don't need to access the deferreds
[12:46:54] <codacoder> no I realize that- you're brave maaan
[12:47:13] <shoky> i kill women too
[12:47:21] <codacoder> structure: outer -> inner (window -> iframe)
[12:47:28] <codacoder> not plural
[12:47:40] <codacoder> 4 scripts go into 1 iframe
[12:47:47] <shoky> o
[12:48:08] <shoky> and each of them calls a function on the outer one when its ready..?
[12:48:23] <kollapse> I have elements with IDs that contain the '%' character, yet I can't use that in jQuery selectors because all I get in return is null. How do I make the jQuery selectors work with '%' ?
[12:48:29] <alfik> guys how i can make that this will run only once at the beginning ? http://jsfiddle.net/ugtBe/       cuz its nerf when it doing every time ...
[12:48:51] <codacoder> shoky: yep - at present i  push them to an array and watch its length
[12:49:00] <shoky> codacoder: if you want to avoid globals then use a function scope
[12:49:12] <Lurzino> hello everyone!!! :-)))))
[12:49:15] <codacoder> struck me that a promise solution would be sweeter
[12:50:19] <shoky> well ideally you'd have maybe  afunction injectScript(...)  that creates a deferred, sets up for it to be resolved sometime, and returns its promise
[12:50:43] <DukeDrake> hm
[12:50:48] <codacoder> yep - that much is clear.. .it's the end game that's foxing me
[12:51:35] <codacoder> it's not the usual ajax kinda problem... it's a server call, yes, to get the scripts for the sript elements...
[12:51:43] <kollapse> Any help with my problem ? It's unbelievable this still happens in 2012
[12:52:13] <codacoder> it's a a case of waiting for the browser to finish parsing them and running that doc.ready handler
[12:52:40] <codacoder> hence the "announce ready" thing
[12:52:54] <Lurzino> I have a page where I have a button with id="#mybutton"... I am going to call $.get('./check_realtime', function(data) {...});.... someone could give me a direction about how I can change #mybutton state inside the function(data) depending the data variable?
[12:53:05] <codacoder> shoky: gonna try what you said
[12:53:13] <DukeDrake> I selected some elements and would like to filter the set down  , and select all elements whose parent() ... is ':visible' . What's the right syntax?
[12:53:39] <RandalSchwartz> is there a way to select items that contain a given text?
[12:53:40] <shoky> codacoder: cool. im here ;p
[12:53:54] <RandalSchwartz> I'm looking for <td>BOOKING_ID</td>
[12:53:55] <RandalSchwartz> literally that
[12:53:57] <shoky> chomp
[12:53:58] <shoky> er
[12:53:59] <codacoder> shoky: see you in a week or two ;)
[12:54:06] <shoky> RandalSchwartz:  :contains(..) selector
[12:54:11] <RandalSchwartz> aha
[12:54:24] <shoky> codacoder: :P
[12:55:01] <shoky> so.. $('td:contains(BOOKING_ID)') i guess
[12:55:19] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, thanks
[12:55:44] <Lurzino> I have a page where I have a button with id="#mybutton"... I am going to call $.get('./check_realtime', function(data) {...});.... someone could give me a direction about how I can change #mybutton state inside the function(data) depending the data variable?....
[12:55:48] * evlh bows at the jquery wizard
[12:56:03] * shoky curtsies
[12:57:49] <DukeDrake> Lurzino: well ... how about if(data == "foo") $('#mybutton').addClass('bar')
[12:59:01] <Lurzino> DukeDrake ah so I can call $("#mybutton") inside the function callback?
[12:59:22] <shoky> jquery's aaaaaaalways there for you
[12:59:32] <DukeDrake> Lurzino: sure
[12:59:45] <Lurzino> ah ok DukeDrake thanks :)
[12:59:51] <DukeDrake> ^^
[13:00:20] <RandalSchwartz> ok - next problem.  I find that <td>, how do I know what count it is of all tds that are in this tr
[13:00:29] <RandalSchwartz> I need the column number, in other words
[13:00:32] <RandalSchwartz> ignore colspan :)
[13:01:49] <DukeDrake> I got links in a table. Some rows are hidden. I selected all links like var mylinks = $('#mytable a') and would now like to filter those so I only have the links in rows which are visible ?
[13:02:34] <DukeDrake> mylinks.filter( ... ) ?
[13:02:53] <NoiseEee> DukeDrake: $('#mytable a:visible') iirc
[13:03:16] <DukeDrake> NoiseEee: oh .... that'd be cool =D
[13:03:57] <juseppe> guys how i can make run this only once?  http://pastebin.com/5JKCnpVu ?
[13:04:12] <shoky> RandalSchwartz:  you can use the .index() method for that  (one of its variants should help you)
[13:04:20] <NoiseEee> juseppe: http://api.jquery.com/one/
[13:05:09] <juseppe> NoiseEee okey but how to place it .. ?  i had seen this allready but i have no clue of how to add it to my code .. :/
[13:06:27] <shoky> juseppe: unless its in a function that you're calling twice, it'll only be run once..
[13:06:33] <NoiseEee> juseppe: the code you pasted... what makes you think its going to be run more than once?
[13:07:27] <juseppe> NoiseEee what ? i want that it loads only at beginning then stop with it cuz it nerf when its all time ... fade ..
[13:07:58] <shoky> wat
[13:08:34] <juseppe> shoky simple i need that it will be runed only once at begin of a browser like when you close browser and again start it will do another time
[13:08:36] <NoiseEee> juseppe: i see your "what?" and counter you with a "what?"
[13:08:56] <shoky> :S
[13:09:02] <juseppe> :D
[13:09:05] <juseppe> :(
[13:09:17] <shoky> if you don't call it more than once, it wont run more than once
[13:09:23] <NoiseEee> juseppe: your code *does* that.  runs once.
[13:09:25] <shoky> simple, as u say
[13:09:41] <juseppe> Noise so i need remove the document ready and it will be only once runed ?
[13:09:53] <NoiseEee> juseppe: what makes you think its being run more than once?!
[13:09:58] <juseppe> i mean only once per browser cache or idk how to write it. .
[13:10:04] <juseppe> when they close the browser it will be removed
[13:10:14] <NoiseEee> juseppe: set a cookie to track that its been run
[13:10:18] <juseppe> and when they again run browser it will be runed again only once .. then it will no more run .. :/
[13:10:46] <NoiseEee> juseppe: are you saying "run one time ever?"   ie: runs one time, and on every subsequent visit to the page its not run?
[13:12:14] <juseppe> NoiseEee no i mean only 1 time per session like this .... when they close browser and again start it will run again but then when they refresh page it will be no loaded
[13:12:59] <juseppe> NoiseEee undertood me ? :/
[13:14:26] <shoky> cookie plz
[13:14:52] <juseppe> shoky :D
[13:15:13] <NoiseEee> juseppe: yes, a cookie that lasts the duration of the browser session.
[13:15:41] <shoky> man that's a big cookie
[13:17:25] <juseppe> NoiseEee look cookie but dont works why ? :/ http://pastebin.com/HmQ1YL67
[13:17:47] <shoky> codacoder: check out http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine//gg723713.aspx
[13:17:51] <juseppe> shoky http://pastebin.com/HmQ1YL67     little cookie :D
[13:18:15] <shoky> ;P
[13:18:35] <shoky> juseppe: there's no $.cookie ..
[13:18:50] <juseppe> shoky hm.
[13:18:52] <shoky> unless you use a plugin
[13:19:37] <evlh> shoky, would I use .stop to avoid my fadein/fadeouts from being queued?
[13:19:48] <evlh> Or would that only apply to animation?
[13:20:04] <juseppe> shoky so i need a plugin to use cookies ?
[13:20:13] <shoky> juseppe: for example https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[13:20:26] <shoky> juseppe: or you can use non-jquery way of setting cookie
[13:20:50] <shoky> evlh: .stop doesnt stop things from being queued
[13:21:12] <evlh> can you prevent fadein/fadeout queues?
[13:21:20] <shoky> yea sec
[13:21:22] <Jon47> you can do anything
[13:21:24] <evlh> lol
[13:22:02] <juseppe> shoky so can you help me with the non jquery or its long ?
[13:22:05] <shoky> well, with .animate() you can set queue:false
[13:22:22] <evlh> yeah, i knew that one.
[13:23:31] <shoky> so just use animate ;P
[13:24:33] <evlh> :/
[13:24:34] <juseppe> shoky k i downloaded the plugin and using the jquery ty
[13:24:56] <shoky> kul
[13:26:37] <evlh> Hmph.
[13:28:11] <antnash> Hey guys. What's wrong with this? $('#dialogdiv').delay(1000).dialog('close');
[13:28:16] <shoky> evlh: if you are repeatedly calling .fadeOut() or something in response to an event
[13:28:48] <shoky> evlh: then you could do .stop().fadeOut()
[13:29:12] <shoky> or even .stop(true,true).fadeOut()
[13:30:36] <shoky> also see http://css-tricks.com/examples/jQueryStop/
[13:30:37] <antnash> Got it
[13:31:01] <shoky> yea antnash, delay() is only for animations/queued stuff
[13:31:29] <antnash> shoky: Yeah, I put it in the queue
[13:31:40] <shoky> ah
[13:31:56] <shoky> you could also just setTimeout
[13:32:55] <antnash> I'll look into setTimeout. I'm loving jquery.
[13:33:28] <antnash> Only been playing around with it for about a month.
[13:33:51] <antnash> It rocks! Got my multiple upload working, posting nicely to my php mvc
[13:47:50] <mythgarr> I have a question about jQuery UI widget development - I want to build something that simplifies adding a marker (or markers) to a progressbar (http://tinkerbin.com/QPepdDn8)
[13:48:29] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i try $('#'+id).fadeOut('slow'); but the div doesn't fade out and the div has that id
[13:48:48] <mythgarr> What would be the right way to handle passing data into the widget? ie: in the example, how would I pass in 454 & 78%?
[13:49:17] <mythgarr> Krambiorix: did you miss a single quote or is that a copy/paste error?
[13:49:46] <mythgarr> Err - nm
[13:49:46] <mythgarr> sorry
[13:50:38] <Krambiorix> mythgarr, no prob
[13:51:08] <Krambiorix> mythgarr, the id is fileslide4fc536aebd1f1*4face985a45252.16433672
[13:52:43] <mythgarr> Krambiorix - seems to work (http://tinkerbin.com/fUWTgUpu)
[13:53:34] <mythgarr> Although... That * and . may be causing you problems
[13:53:36] <Krambiorix> mythgarr, but not with this id: fileslide4fc536aebd1f1*4face985a45252.16433672
[13:53:57] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: don't thikn * is allowed in an ID
[13:54:08] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: plus it seems like you're really cramming data into an ID
[13:54:46] <NoiseEee> Krambiorix: <element class='fileSlide' data-slideid='4fc536' data-somethingelse='45252.16433672' >
[13:54:49] <Lyfesaver> has anyone heard of a script that will show the websites server CPU meter in html?
[13:54:58] <Lyfesaver> been looking for a way to do this
[13:54:59] <Krambiorix> NoiseEee, mythgarr this works : $('#'+id.replace(/([.])/g,"\\.").replace(/([*])/g,"\\*")).fadeOut('slow');
[13:55:09] <Lyfesaver> but cant seem to find one
[13:55:30] <blendedbychris> is there a way to select any type of form input?
[13:55:41] <fission6> can someone recommend a plugin that carasousels through div content
[13:56:09] <blendedbychris> fission6: i've had some luck with this one https://github.com/Wilto/Dynamic-Carousel
[13:56:45] <fission6> thanks blendedbychris
[13:56:49] <mythgarr> Krambiorix - Good to know that it's possible, but I would still argue that it's probably not a good idea to use those symbols as part of an id :P
[13:57:19] <Krambiorix> mythgarr, what could be a problem? :-)
[13:57:24] <mythgarr> Is this the correct channel to ask about jQuery UI, or is there somewhere else for it?
[13:57:28] <blendedbychris> i guess "if" it has a name attribute
[13:57:29] <blendedbychris> ?\
[13:57:34] <fission6> blendedbychris: where is the documentation
[13:58:56] <blendedbychris> fission6: that's it reallyâ€¦ i know it's a major turn off but the other solution I use is a giant mess of crap (anythingSlider)
[13:59:31] <blendedbychris> an :input
[13:59:31] <blendedbychris> :)
[14:06:07] <mythgarr> Is anybody familiar with jQuery UI widget development?
[14:10:53] <mythgarr> In the absence of that, how can I select something relative to a known element? For instance, I have an element returned by $('#someId'), how can I select the first dl child?
[14:14:15] <NoiseEee> el.children('dl').first()
[14:15:19] <mythgarr> NoiseEee - thanks!
[14:16:12] <aghouseh> anyone ever run into a problem with the chosen() select plugin where chrome reports TypeError: Object [object HTMLDivElement] has no method 'each' and firefox TypeError: this.each is not a function

[14:18:31] <Gsingh> hi what does __proto__ mean in the context of a jquery object?
[14:18:53] <Maco__> huh?
[14:20:05] <sacho_> __proto__ is not a jquery-specific construct
[14:20:25] <Gsingh> I was inspecting an item in jquery object in chrome and came across it
[14:20:38] <Maco__> how i can check if this has finished to procedure my next code ? $("body").queryLoader();
[14:20:48] <snover> Gsingh: thatâ€™s a non-standard property. pretend it does not exist.
[14:20:56] <Gsingh> i see
[14:21:44] <Gsingh> snover: So I have a jQuery object with only __proto__ in it that mean it is empty? how can I check this?
[14:22:20] <Maco__> anyone can help me ?
[14:24:10] <chasem> I have a situation where I need to use onbeforeunload to trigger a cookie clear. I have some code like this: http://pastebin.com/fDj0cA9B to set up a variable on any click or submit button entry. I've also blocked F5 with a keypress and keydown. BUT, is there any way to block a BACK button? This is hurting! Thanks for your help!
[14:25:55] <Gsingh> snover: nevermind i think i found my answer $.isEmptyObject
[14:27:05] <Maco__> hello ?
[14:32:32] <Maco__> can anyone help me ?
[14:32:56] <Maco__> how i can check when this is loaded ? $("body").queryLoader();  do the next script ...
[14:33:45] <Maco__> come on guys .. i want to go sleep .
[14:34:48] <RandalSchwartz> queryLoader?
[14:36:22] <Maco__> RandalSchwartz its my loader what loads all page and images
[14:36:44] <Maco__> RandalSchwartz and now in my index i want check if $("body").queryLoader(); is loaded .. then do tthe next codes.
[14:37:01] <Back2Basics> Maco__: instead of a ";" at the end put a comma and pop up an alert.
[14:37:26] <RandalSchwartz> I think you have to have callbacks for all the loads.
[14:37:29] <antnash> Anyone had any experience with the xhr upload progress event?
[14:37:30] <RandalSchwartz> I'm not sure if that's even possible.
[14:37:46] <RandalSchwartz> why not just add something to "document ready"
[14:37:52] <RandalSchwartz> I think that's when all callbacks are loaded
[14:38:16] <Maco__> sec guys i upload my file
[14:39:18] <Maco__> http://pastebin.com/yXpRK32b problem is at line 4 it loads all is fine but the fade in fade outs are going with the line 4 i need when line 4 has finished do the paradise .. like i have it in comment .
[14:39:49] <Maco__> back2basics, RandalSchwartz is that possible ?
[14:41:10] * RandalSchwartz looks at pastebin
[14:41:27] <RandalSchwartz> ahh - you want a callback *after* the animation
[14:41:32] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, that's possible.
[14:41:40] <RandalSchwartz> dunno syntax offhand
[14:41:41] <Maco__> back2basics, RandalSchwartz here is the file i load at line 4 http://pastebin.com/tta7t1eN
[14:42:02] <RandalSchwartz> look up animation callbacks though
[14:42:07] <RandalSchwartz> then trigger your next step from that
[14:42:12] <Maco__> RandalSchwartz please can you find it for me ? :/ im trying to do it for about an hour and im really tired off :( ....
[14:42:28] <RandalSchwartz> I'm paying $0.25/mionute for this very bad network connection
[14:42:32] <RandalSchwartz> so no, I won't do your work for you
[14:42:58] <RandalSchwartz> try http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery animation callback
[14:43:00] <Back2Basics> Maco__: I've been working on a problem for 2 weeks and yes I'll pay to have it done at this point.
[14:43:40] <RandalSchwartz> ... complete: A function to call once the animation is complete.
[14:44:26] <RandalSchwartz> and .fadeIn also has the same thing
[14:44:29] <RandalSchwartz> there... go read
[14:44:37] <RandalSchwartz> ... callbackA function to call once the animation is complete.
[14:49:37] <RandalSchwartz> maco__ got it yet?
[15:14:28] <raj> shoky, where you at yo?
[15:14:35] <shoky> good timing
[15:14:39] <shoky> yo ;P
[15:14:41] <raj> thas what she said
[15:14:50] <raj> so...question....
[15:14:51] <shoky> sups
[15:15:19] <raj> i have a little voting link (for number of stars), and i want to write Thank You after the user has voted
[15:15:29] <raj> should I do it in the ajax callback, or right away? to make it seem speedier
[15:15:44] <raj> and then just give an error popup if there's an issue
[15:16:16] <shoky> mmm there's no "proper" way.. it's about how you want your UI to function
[15:16:37] <shoky> i'd do it right away. (and if there's something i wanna update in the ajax callback i can still do that)
[15:16:53] <raj> i wanna give the appearance of "Wow, this site is fast!", but I don't wanna do something that's bad practice (if this is bad practice)
[15:17:26] <shoky> nah writing the thank you before it actually submits is fine
[15:17:43] <raj> ok, so immediately say "Thank You!", and if there's an error, show some sort of notification and remove the selected star and the Thank You
[15:18:12] <shoky> if that's how you want it :P (sounds fine)
[15:18:29] <raj> ok, thanks :)
[15:18:32] <shoky> ;]
[15:18:40] <blendedbychris> can i do a selector based on data attribute?
[15:18:51] <shoky> blendedbychris: same as any other attribute
[15:18:58] <blendedbychris> even if it's dynamically seT?
[15:19:03] <raj> btw, what kinda bs at the end of that episode? how were they getting their asses beat, and then all of a sudden they just win
[15:19:04] <shoky> yea
[15:19:16] <raj> no inbtwn story, or visuals
[15:19:19] <raj> just "we won"
[15:19:27] <shoky> raj yea it was pretty lame :\ this whole season is .. feh
[15:19:30] <raj> and if midgit dies, I'm not watching the show anymore
[15:19:33] <shoky> ^^
[15:19:53] <shoky> at least there was lots of killing ;(
[15:20:06] <raj> meh
[15:20:11] <raj> i'm not impressed by the action
[15:20:13] <shoky> but it was dumb... the whole episode just focused on that.. nothing happens this season :(
[15:20:13] <raj> i prefer the story
[15:20:23] <shoky> and they have only 1 more ep
[15:20:32] <raj> not even half as many naked main characters
[15:20:34] <shoky> for like 100 stories to finish
[15:20:37] <shoky> heh
[15:20:53] <raj> yeah, she's still bitching about her freaking dragons
[15:21:05] <raj> wah wah wahmbulance
[15:21:18] <shoky> snow in the north, bitch with her dragons, burnt pseudo-bodies in winterfell blah blah
[15:21:41] <shoky> the king in the north......
[15:21:41] <raj> yeah, seriously, no closure on anything
[15:21:54] <raj> and hardly developed in the past 3 episodes
[15:22:09] <shoky> ;[
[15:22:17] <tw2113> how the heck did GoT become the current topic of convo
[15:22:18] <shoky> the second book must be boring as hell
[15:22:36] <shoky> it's always the topic
[15:23:13] <blendedbychris> shoky:  what would it look likeâ€¦ i tried $('.child_line_item[childId="0"]') â€¦ the attribute is set by data-child-id="0" or data('childId', 0)
[15:24:39] <blendedbychris> oh :childId maybe
[15:24:54] <blendedbychris> there we go :)
[15:25:49] <shoky> [data-child-id="0"] ?
[15:26:04] <donnaR> does get works for cross-domain pictures requests?
[15:26:21] <shoky> get?
[15:26:24] <blendedbychris> :childId works
[15:26:30] <shoky> what's :childId ..
[15:26:40] <blendedbychris> data-child-id
[15:26:46] <donnaR> http get requests
[15:26:48] <blendedbychris> jquery seems to turn things into camelcase
[15:27:04] <blendedbychris> so data-child-id is data('childId')
[15:27:24] <shoky> ok but what's :childId  <-- what kinda selector is that?
[15:27:37] <blendedbychris> data selector I presume
[15:27:40] <shoky> huh/
[15:27:46] <raj> it was blended by chris
[15:27:53] <shoky> l0l
[15:28:11] <blendedbychris> i'm confused
[15:28:15] <shoky> what do you mean data selector.. how are you using it?
[15:28:46] <blendedbychris> it's a line item id so i can relate some fieldsets
[15:29:04] <shoky> how are you using the selector :childId  ??
[15:29:16] <blendedbychris> $child_line_item = $('.child_line_item[:childId="' + $child.data('childId') + '"]');
[15:29:24] <shoky> wtf.
[15:29:31] <shoky> oh
[15:29:43] <blendedbychris> child is literallyâ€¦. a human child if that helpsh eh
[15:29:51] <shoky> that doesn't give you an error?
[15:29:56] <blendedbychris> no
[15:30:04] <shoky> huh......
[15:30:08] <shoky> i'm confused too
[15:30:31] <blendedbychris> mind you i don't think it works hehâ€¦ still playing with it
[15:30:53] <shoky> sure you're not getting an error in the console?
[15:31:11] <blendedbychris> yes but tb it's returning the same id
[15:31:14] <shoky> cause im getting stuff like: Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [:childId='heh']
[15:31:27] <shoky> which makes sense.
[15:31:32] <blendedbychris> :childId is set using data() or data- first
[15:31:38] <blendedbychris> fucking emoticons
[15:31:39] <shoky> where did you hear about that?
[15:32:01] <blendedbychris> eh stackoverflow i tried
[15:32:02] <blendedbychris> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2891452/jquery-data-selector
[15:32:42] <blendedbychris> looks hypothetical now that i read it hah
[15:32:58] <shoky> yes..
[15:33:10] <shoky> there is no such thing afaik..
[15:33:27] <blendedbychris> okay so data-child-id it is
[15:34:05] <blendedbychris> only issue there is elements set with .data() don't select properly
[15:35:04] <shoky> you should use classes & ids for stuff you're gonna want to select
[15:36:15] <blendedbychris> nay
[15:36:30] <shoky> kay
[15:37:06] <sayd> i'm using a deferred object, and passing an array to .resolveWith for the second argument seems to only get the first elemetn of that array in the .done promise
[15:37:50] <shoky> wat
[15:38:41] <shoky> got some code to show?
[15:38:55] <blendedbychris> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/a-better-data-selector-for-jquery/ << bam
[15:39:13] <blindMoe> anyone know if it is possible to group guides / rules in photoshop?
[15:39:14] <sayd> shoky: https://gist.github.com/1c3580beecc0475e3f81
[15:39:27] <blindMoe> blah wrong channel :)
[15:40:33] <sayd> shoky: basically line 11 chomps the array into one element in the invocation of 16-17
[15:40:56] <shoky> sayd: what exactly is html?
[15:41:21] <shoky> [<el></el>,<el></el>] is neither valid javascript nor html
[15:41:29] <sayd> thats an example
[15:41:34] <sayd> its a jquery array of nodes
[15:41:38] <shoky> but be more precise with your example
[15:41:40] <shoky> ok
[15:42:01] <shoky> so why are you passing an array to .html ?
[15:42:59] <sayd> shoky: hrmm maybe i need to .toString() it>
[15:43:00] <sayd> ?
[15:43:07] <shoky> and why would you call an array of DOM nodes 'html'
[15:43:22] <sayd> thats prob my prob
[15:43:38] <shoky> you should .append() for example
[15:43:55] <shoky> .html wants an HTML string. no reason to encode HTML here
[15:44:15] <riku^> anyone here have experience with box2d & canvas?
[15:44:15] <shoky> $(this).empty().append( arrayOfDomNodes )
[15:47:18] <sayd> shoky: same thing. i'm not receiving an array in the .done invocation. cleaned up the example https://gist.github.com/1c3580beecc0475e3f81
[15:48:03] <shoky> sayd: what do you get when you console.log(arrayOfDomNodes)
[15:49:01] <sayd> shoky: just the first element of the array i pass into resolveWith
[15:49:27] <shoky> ahhh
[15:49:34] <shoky> cause resolveWith takes an array
[15:49:38] <shoky> so
[15:49:47] <sayd> but nodes is an array
[15:49:52] <sayd> line 11
[15:49:54] <shoky> exactly
[15:50:16] <shoky> its taking each array element and putting it as a seperate argument to your done callback
[15:50:19] <shoky> so,
[15:50:43] <shoky> ummm so just:  deferred.resolveWith(this, [nodes]) should do the trick
[15:50:46] <shoky> i think..
[15:51:20] <shoky> and i'm guessing you'd also need deferred.rejectWith(this, [status])
[15:51:34] <shoky> because status is not an array
[15:51:42] <sayd> mmk will try
[15:52:27] <sayd> so basically the function passed to .done is receiving nodes[0], nodes[1], ...
[15:52:28] <sayd> ?
[15:52:33] <shoky> right now, yeah
[15:53:31] <sayd> that clears it up, thanks

[16:24:09] <bung> kinda hard to find good search words for this, anyone know any resource explaining why people use _/ for _/img/ _/js/ vs say includes/ or inc/
[16:24:24] <bung> is it seriously folder naming optimization? lol
[16:26:02] <jakemask> is .on() able to do scroll events? the api says .scroll or .bind('scroll'), and i can't find anything about doing .on('scroll'
[16:31:08] <shoky> jakemask it can
[16:32:02] <jakemask> alright, and does it matter if I add an event to an object before or after i push it to the DOM?
[16:32:40] <shoky> yes. you can't bind an event on an element that isn't in the DOM
[16:33:04] <shoky> but you can delegate the event handling to a container element that IS in the DOM, if you need to
[16:33:15] <shoky> with .on
[16:34:20] <jakemask> alright. So I have an object i built previously, I append it into another object (that is already in the DOM), and then i use .on to handle the scroll event
[16:35:26] <shoky> should work
[16:36:12] <jakemask> blargh
[16:36:49] <shoky> well. actually you can bind the event before its in the DOM i guess
[16:37:07] <shoky> but after it exists ;p
[16:37:38] <jakemask> I think my issues are elsewhere in my code.
[16:37:43] <shoky> ;[
[16:38:18] <shoky> bung: whacha mean?
[16:40:19] <shoky> oh i see
[16:45:05] <devOlsen> afternoon all
[16:46:28] <jakemask> @shoky - thanks for your help, i got it figured out. it wasn't actually on the DOM yet because of some AJAX stuff on another layer I wasn't thinking about.
[16:47:53] <tw2113> oh that shoky he's so halpful
[16:53:15] <jfisk87> hey all
[16:53:59] <jfisk87> how could i setup a custom eventlistener? I have a method that updates a variable, and i want this object to listen for when it would fire
[16:55:57] <guilhermekfe> will normal jquery work on mobile browsers?
[17:01:55] <digs> I really like this datepicker from UI, however, it doesn't give me enough control over which dates are selectable or not. I know I can choose a selectable date range... which is a great start... but I need more control such as holidays or the ability to 'blackout' all thursday and fridays.
[17:02:06] <digs> What is my best approach to accomplish this?
[17:03:03] <digs> is it to just dig my heels into the datepicker js code and hack away?
[17:03:14] <digs> hack == extend
[17:03:34] <jfisk87> ah i found the trigger() command
[17:03:40] <jfisk87> is there a version of self in javascript?
[17:13:16] <shoky> whacha mean?
[17:19:57] <shoky> raj: Mortchek meant:  if (arr.indexOf('small') >= 0 && arr.indexOf('medium') >= 0 && arr.indexOf('large') >= 0)
[17:20:31] <raj> i love you bro
[17:20:48] <shoky> ;P
[17:22:16] <digs> shoky, sorry to prod... but any ideas on my question?
[17:22:31] <digs> Or to rephrase, what would you do?
[17:22:55] <shoky> mmm sorry i havent used datepicker myself.. dont really know my way around it
[17:28:39] <shoky> digs: have you tried the 'beforeShowDay' event ?
[17:29:00] <shoky> it takes a CSS class
[17:29:26] <shoky> and it allows you to enable/disable selection for specific dates
[17:41:40] * shoky slaps digs around a bit with a wakeboard
[17:44:26] <shoky> digs: http://jsfiddle.net/tW93H/
[17:50:19] <g0bl1n> I need to apply some css changes when a page is loaded. Can the event be tied to an object, like an image ? When the image is rendered, then run a method...
[18:05:56] <g0bl1n> all good   $("#diagram").ready(function () { console.log("image ready"); });
[18:08:40] <g0bl1n> * not ready() but load()
[18:12:25] <digs> shoky, yes... but that doesn't do what I want.
[18:13:11] <loladiro> I have a web app that issues a request (using jquery) to a lighttpd-based SCGI server. Now, I can see the request in firebug and both request and reponse look fine. This problem only occurs with servers that are running windows. Has anybody ever experienced something similar?
[18:13:20] <digs> I need to be able to do X number of blackouts based on all sorts of different information... unless you are saying I can add them as many as I like...
[18:13:23] <digs> let me see something...
[18:15:49] <digs> shoky, something like this... http://jsfiddle.net/tW93H/4/
[18:15:57] <digs> but that obviously doesn't work.
[18:16:13] <digs> and I may want to have 15 different parameters.
[18:16:55] <digs> I know that the datepicker has the min max option... but that is not nearly enough.
[18:53:03] <raj> shoky, can jquery/js morph an image into another image?
[18:53:14] <raj> (not fade)
[18:53:20] <raj> but like mold
[18:54:24] <rodd> what's the best approach for a plugin that clones content into a new element (like a popover plugin) - To insert new elements on user actions (such as a click or hover a specific element) - or create a single element and update its content?
[18:55:06] <raj> rodd, just select and change html
[18:55:09] <raj> or append
[18:55:16] <rodd> or create, show and remove
[18:55:28] <raj> sure
[18:55:31] <Vinny> i'd say use the clone method
[19:03:41] <rodd> $( '.element', $context ) is the same of $context.find( '.element' ), correct?
[19:04:57] <Vinny> @rodd i believe the first one will be faster
[19:05:21] <shoky> not faster
[19:05:44] <rodd> isnt the second one faster?
[19:07:12] <shoky> the second one is a teeny tiny bit faster
[19:07:17] <shoky> but.. they're the same.
[19:07:21] <Vinny> http://jsperf.com/jquery-deep-selector-vs-simple-selector-find/3
[19:08:05] <shoky> yep
[19:09:08] <digs> shoky, did you see my response?
[19:10:18] <shoky> digs: donno what you're doing in that fiddle.. did you read how to use the beforeShowDay event ?
[19:11:07] <shoky> digs: but as you saw in my example, you can change the css and enable/disable each date by itself..
[19:11:56] <joelbirch> Vinny I'm late to the conversation, but that jsperf is interesting
[19:12:52] <digs> shoky, what I am trying to do is this: make that example you have disable all weekends, thrusdays and fridays and also disable the day 8.
[19:12:58] <joelbirch> Vinny I thought jQuery would use querySelectorAll behind the scenes if available, but then why wouldn't some of the other cases be faster?
[19:13:42] <digs> so the only valid selectable dates are 1,2,7,9,14,15,16,21,22,23,28,29,30
[19:13:57] <digs> As an example of what I will need to be able to do.
[19:14:30] <digs> but obviously I can't choose those days. I need to choose the actual day of the week... disable thusday, friday, saturday sunday... and also be able to disable specific days.
[19:14:52] <digs> like 7/4/2012 for example.
[19:18:12] <shoky> you can do all that..
[19:19:31] <digs> Well that would be wonderful.
[19:22:06] <Vinny> joelbirch: sorry i was afk, but as far as some of the deep searching (IE6+7) I found the find methods to be too much overhead
[19:23:29] <monstordh> speaking of datesâ€¦ can someone tell me how to grab with the parts of a date?
[19:23:55] <joelbirch> Vinny it seems to me that the difference is not in the find methods, but in the first part of those selectors
[19:24:12] <Vinny> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp
[19:25:02] <shoky> digs: http://jsfiddle.net/ztYAG/1/
[19:27:33] <digs> shoky, you are awesome... so I just need to figure out how to know what days are what.
[19:27:35] <shoky> digs: and now it'll work for any month: http://jsfiddle.net/ztYAG/2/

[19:34:33] <monstordh> Vinny: Sorry - I just now saw the jsref_date_obj_date link you posted. That's great. However, I first need to be able to grab it from a date field. Any suggestions?
[19:35:05] <Vinny> monstordh: what are you trying to get from a date field?
[19:35:35] <monstordh> right now it's in the form of dd/mm/yyyy. i need to grab each of the parts
[19:37:12] <Vinny> monstordh: could grab the value form the input and do a split("/") ?
[19:37:48] <scathen^C> hey. I am trying to use .replaceWith() but am having no luck. In firebug a watch on my object shows: jQuery(<TextNode textContent="http://www.youtube.com/...vw4ROXPU&feature=g-vrec">. Then I run replaceWith(code) where code is "<iframe width="640" hei...lowfullscreen></iframe>" <- but it seems as though the replacewith does nothing???
[19:38:21] <monstordh> i'm sure. it's just new territory. should i look up split() in the api?
[19:39:51] <Vinny> monstordh: http://jsfiddle.net/5UL9m/
[19:40:02] <Vinny> don't write like that >.<
[19:40:50] <tw2113_as_well> get what i said monstordh ?
[19:41:35] <monstordh> sorry, guys. dealing with a fussy baby as well
[19:41:44] <monstordh> tw2113_as_well: i didn't see your comment. let me scroll up
[19:41:56] <tw2113_as_well> need to find a way to explode the date at the /'s
[19:42:02] <tw2113_as_well> i know php has a way
[19:42:25] <Vinny> monstordh:  $("#baby").appendTo("#mom") ? "Done" : "Sorry bout that" ;
[19:42:56] <digs> really thanks again shoky, you helped me so much.
[19:43:13] <jaypitidi> http://jsfiddle.net/EfKrx/ :Why isn't my show() animation working at all here?
[19:44:25] * tw2113_once beats the crap out of nickserv
[19:44:38] <monstordh> Vinny: LOL!!
[19:45:23] <tw2113> ?split monstordh
[19:45:29] <tw2113> ?split
[19:45:50] <tw2113> no bot?
[19:45:59] <monstordh> tw2113: I think split will work
[19:46:22] <jaypitidi> show() is working but the effects I passed to it is not
[19:46:35] <tw2113> should put the parts into an array for you monstordh
[19:51:44] <otherj> guys, does jquery have something like ruby's debug so i can see everything available in an object?
[19:51:54] <digs> jaypitidi what is not working?
[19:52:09] <digs> It seems to work for me, I mean I get the menu.
[19:52:21] <otherj> i'm trying to figure out how to loop through some json stuff but i need to see what i'm working with
[19:52:23] <digs> when I mouseover I get a 3 item drop down.
[19:52:30] <jaypitidi> well when you hover over the menu the height changes, but the drop down menu is supposed to slideDown
[19:52:41] <digs> it slides down for me.
[19:52:45] <digs> Try to run it again.
[19:52:56] <digs> using chrome on windows 7 here.
[19:53:06] <digs> 19.0.x
[19:53:25] <jaypitidi> I'm using chrome on osx
[19:53:31] <digs> I do get a console error though on your show.
[19:53:38] <digs> it works as expected thoguh.
[19:53:40] <jaypitidi> and it drops down, but there is supposed to be an animation, I mean
[19:54:18] <jaypitidi> not just show() but show('slide',{direction: "down"})
[19:54:19] <digs> ahhh you mean it doesn't "slide" down.
[19:55:55] <digs> gah. they are kicking me out of my office... closing up... I won't be on later either.
[19:56:10] <digs> sorry man... I was just checking into it... however... the console error...
[19:56:15] <digs> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[19:56:29] <digs> and above that... Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[19:56:48] <digs> I think you have it wrapped incorrectly or somethign.
[19:56:50] <digs> gtg
[19:56:50] <jaypitidi> thats jsfiddle
[19:56:52] <scathen^C> hey all, any ideas why both alerts in the code show the same thing? alert(content.html());
[19:56:52] <scathen^C>             content.replaceWith("test");
[19:56:52] <scathen^C>             alert(content.html());
[19:57:25] <scathen^C> any ideas why the second alert wouldn't be test?
[20:03:05] <scathen^C> is anyone able to help me with this? https://gist.github.com/2833475 It's only 3 lines...
[20:09:40] <Vinny> scathen^C: does that replaceWith() block execution?
[20:11:27] <scathen^C> vinny: yes it does, i realise now that replacewith doesn't actually effect content
[20:15:20] <hello_kitty> is there a syntax like the following for creating a text input?  $('<input/>', { type : 'text', val : '324' } );
[20:15:25] <rodd> uh
[20:15:29] <rodd> any idea what this might be?
[20:15:30] <rodd> cache[id] is undefined
[20:15:31] <rodd> cache[ id ].toJSON = jQuery.noop;
[20:15:44] <rodd> jquery-1.7.1.js (line 1691)
[20:17:22] <hello_kitty> or maybe is there another syntax for creating a text input from variables that doesnt involve string concatenation?
[20:19:35] <hello_kitty> ah i found it, and it can be set via type:'text' without an .attr
[20:21:01] <otherj> anyone know javascript templates? (blueimp, uses jquery) i'm trying to loop based on a json var
[20:22:32] <roler> If I have a < input type="checkbox name="foo" value="bar" abc="123"> --- how can I grab abc, a custom attribute?
[20:25:10] <rodd> I'm getting something weird with .data
[20:25:24] <rodd> This works just fine: $( '.fetchPreviousPosts' ).data( 'writtenbefore', writtenBefore );
[20:25:34] <rodd> however this: $.data( '.fetchPreviousPosts', 'writtenbefore', writtenBefore );
[20:25:50] <rodd> gives me the following error: cache[id] is undefined -> jquery-1.7.1.js (line 1691)
[20:26:16] <rodd> writtenBefore is valid
[21:22:25] <jandarii> can i use event delegation for resize events?
[21:27:47] <snover> resize is a window event so it would be kind of hard to delegate since there is no higher object to which it can bubble
[21:38:19] <Cork> snover: you have the jquery-ui fake resize events
[21:38:43] <Cork> on all resizable widgets
[21:38:59] <Cork> not sure if it bubbles or not in later versions
[21:41:29] <snover> Cork: does that actually trigger a *dom* event?
[21:41:42] <Cork> it triggers a jquery event
[21:41:47] <Cork> not a dom event
[21:42:04] <Cork> as in it uses $().trigger('resize')
[21:42:25] <ColKurtz> So I made a little favelet to invite all your friends to a Facebook eventâ€¦I load jQuery just to make it easier to deal with the elements that FB loads via AJAXâ€¦and because they generate a different ID for different elements each time. Anybody see any possible improvements I could make? http://pastie.org/3993128
[21:42:55] <ColKurtz> performance improvements, I mean
[21:43:24] <jandarii> what's the point of the namespace in a jquery widget?
[21:44:14] <ColKurtz> are you talking to me jandarii ?
[21:45:16] <Cork> jandarii: to prevent name collision
[21:49:09] <jandarii> ColKurtz: only if you have the answer :)
[21:49:18] <ColKurtz> lol
[21:49:23] <ColKurtz> what Cork said
[21:50:49] <jandarii> ooh, so if $.fn.plugin exists it will be attached to $.fn.namespace.plugin?
[21:51:00] <Cork> no
[21:52:12] <Cork> but $.fn.john.myPlugin doens't collide with $.fn.doe.myPlugin
[21:54:49] <jandarii> but one of them is still accessible by $( "#foo" ).myPlugin(), right?
[21:57:10] <Cork> my memory is failing me a bit, but i think there is limitations there
[21:57:24] <Cork> but yes they will be accessable through $()
[21:57:34] <jandarii> but which?!
[21:57:52] <Cork> if i remember correctly its the last one declared
[21:58:17] <Cork> was a while since i wrote my last ui plugin
[22:00:11] <jandarii> ah okay, makes sense
[22:00:55] <jandarii> do people generally use their name / company / development moniker as the namespace?
[22:01:07] <Cork> its up to them
[22:01:22] <Cork> the only restriction is the use of ui.
[22:01:32] <jandarii> fair enough
[22:01:43] <hope> hello im having trouble using bootstrap typeahead can someone help me please
[22:01:53] <jandarii> thanks for the help :)
[22:01:58] <Cork> np
[22:03:24] <joelbirch> hope just show your problem and see if anyone answers
[22:03:46] <Cork> ?ask @ hope
[22:03:57] <Cork> oh... lovely the bot is down again
[22:04:26] <hope> this is my problem i use typeahead bootstrap and it is working in the first time but in the second time it wont can you please help me
[22:04:27] <tw2113> Amercia! fuck yeah!
[22:04:49] <joelbirch> with that amount of info, no-one can help you, hope
[22:05:21] <Cork> hope: are you replacing any elements between the two times?
[22:05:46] <hope> no
[22:06:04] <Cork> then you need to provide a demo or a live link
[22:07:22] <MBehtemam> hi , what means (this)   in  $(":input",this).each(function(index,element){});
[22:07:53] <Cork> MBehtemam: $(":input",this) is a short hand for $(this).find(":input")
[22:08:20] <MBehtemam> Cork: thanks
[22:08:24] <Cork> np
[22:09:01] <tw2113> not too much shorter
[22:09:11] <tw2113> eh, disregard
[22:09:12] <Cork> but more confusing
[22:09:18] <Cork> i agree
[22:09:29] <tw2113> saves on a .find()
[22:09:36] <tw2113> but yes, a bit confusing
[22:10:27] <tw2113> how sad...only 1 friend of mine on facebook likes jquery
[22:11:52] <mindis|wurk> heh, didn't know about :input before. i just usually used normal css selectors
[22:12:10] <Cork> mindis|wurk: most of the time its faster
[22:12:19] <Cork> (normal css selectors)
[22:12:19] <tw2113> i need more webdev friends on facebook
[22:12:49] <Cork> mindis|wurk: :input means a function is called for each element found by the selector on the left of it
[22:14:43] <Lucky--> jquery, my ui framework, and my code together is a 538kb js file. #wow.
[22:15:28] <Haprog> Lucky--: all minified?
[22:15:33] <Lucky--> yes!
[22:15:34] <Lucky--> well
[22:15:36] <Lucky--> 80%
[22:15:36] <Lucky--> of it
[22:15:49] * tw2113 puts Lucky--'s js file on the subway diet
[22:17:22] <Lucky--> https://dtzuojp79nhw2.cloudfront.net/js/payday.js
[22:17:32] <Lucky--> have fun reading that pos
[22:19:30] <tw2113> sublime text minifyer times out on it
[22:20:15] <Lucky--> ROFL
[22:20:27] <Lucky--> then again I did replace all of my php with jquery
[22:20:34] <tw2113> ran it through an online one, 488.2kb
[22:20:37] <Lucky--> suck it php
[22:20:59] <Lucky--> which one
[22:21:05] <tw2113> http://jscompress.com/
[22:21:34] <Lucky--> it actually crashed visual studio
[22:21:36] <Lucky--> on me
[22:21:38] <Lucky--> due to resharper
[22:22:55] <tw2113> http://jsminify.net/ on high got it down to 88kb
[22:22:59] <tw2113> er 85
[22:23:16] <Lucky--> no shit?
[22:23:24] <tw2113> try it yourself
[22:23:33] <tw2113>  Compression : 602.4% ( 611113 -> 87000 = 524113 bytes less )
[22:24:21] <Lucky--> i wonder if it'll still work :-)
[22:24:32] <tw2113> try it
[22:24:34] <tw2113> and see
[22:24:45] <Lucky--> doing it in notepad++
[22:24:49] <Lucky--> vs wouldnt handle it :-)
[22:24:53] <mindis|wurk> i hope you're not doing a site completely in js
[22:25:05] <Lucky--> mindis|wurk: web services abck end
[22:25:23] <hope> hello there im having trouble with my typeahead bootstrap because i can use it only once. and i need to refresh the page to make it work again. can you please give me an advice ?
[22:25:27] <Lucky--> mindis|wurk: plus its better then php imo.
[22:25:34] <Lucky--> I still have yet to see a linux kernel written in php.
[22:25:46] <Lucky--> jslinux
[22:25:59] <mindis|wurk> just because you can do something doesn't mean you should :P
[22:26:54] <Haprog> Lucky--: There seems to be a JS parser for PHP though. So you could run jslinux on it ;P
[22:27:05] <hope> hello there im having trouble with my typeahead bootstrap because i can use it only once. and i need to refresh the page to make it work again. can you please give me an advice ?
[22:27:24] <Haprog> and btw jslinux is basically a PC emulator not linux kernel rewritten for JS
[22:27:45] <Lucky--> lol haprog
[22:27:48] <joelbirch> hope set up a demo page
[22:29:20] <Lucky--> jsminify destroyed it
[22:29:21] <Lucky--> lol
[22:33:00] <scathen^C> can anyone tell me why my replaceWith call inside an ajax success fails, but works fine if called before the ajax function?
[22:34:07] <ryanaz> why don't you call the replace with after the ajax?
[22:34:31] <Cork> scathen^C: your missing the context
[22:35:01] <Cork> scathen^C: 1. what are you doing with the data from your ajax call, 2. what changes are you doing to your dom
[22:35:27] <ryanaz>  $.ajax({ url: "/api/auth.cgi", cache: false, dataType: "json", type: "POST", data: { email: email.val(), password: password.val() }, context: document.body }).success(function(json) { var status = json.status; if (status == "success") { document.location.href="https://beta.stratfuel.com/site.cgi"; } else { updateTips("Error: Invalid Username or Password"); } });
[22:35:44] <ryanaz> scathen^C: I'm doing this for one of my ajax calls, seems to be pretty cool..
[22:37:12] <scathen^C> ok
[22:43:24] <scathen^C> cork: im using ajax/json to retrieve oembed data for a url so that i can use replaceWith to change the url to the embed code. everything works, except for the replaceWith() call (which does nothing). If i test replaceWith just before the ajax call with some dummy data the replacement is successful. I just tried context: document.body, but now it doesn't even return success
[22:50:45] <Cork> scathen^C: you need to provide code and html
[22:51:16] <Cork> just explaining in general terms doens't let you see where it fails
[23:08:05] <scathen^C> cork: lol embedly was blcoking my ip......just another question: is there a way i can detect json fails? if i use error: it doesn't trigger
[23:12:45] <hope> good day. i have a problem with my bootstrap modal.it seems that some scripts that i made cannot be included in the DOM when i used bootstrap modal.
[23:12:52] <hope> please help me
[23:16:07] <joelbirch> post some code (pastebin), make a demo and link to it. Ask specific questions.
[23:40:33] <daleharvey> how do I stop jquery sending If-None-Match headers
[23:49:14] <sacho_> huh?
[23:49:19] <sacho_> in what case is it sending those headers?
[23:50:08] <daleharvey> well the browser (firefox) was sending if-none-match on my ajax requests, I wondered if I could disable it from ajax
[23:50:28] <daleharvey> but worked around it
