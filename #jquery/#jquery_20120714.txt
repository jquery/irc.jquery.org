[00:12:42] <whomp> shoky, my dilemma is that i want to move an image from off the page, where the image can't see it, into the exact center of the page
[00:13:08] <whomp> so i want to go from something like margin-left:-20px to margin: 0 auto
[00:22:15] <shoky> whomp: so figure out what the coordinates are
[00:23:09] <pneftali> hi guys - how can I stop/pause the slow iteration when there's a hover event on the children divs ? http://jsfiddle.net/U7cDV/
[00:24:06] <risto> hello there, can i get some help with a small jquery problem? :>
[00:24:17] <shoky> whomp: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Agjzn/
[00:25:46] <tw2113> only once you actually state your issue risto
[00:26:13] <risto> sorry. here it comes: http://jsfiddle.net/7NLvc/2/
[00:26:44] <risto> so, if i add a static class to #foo the click() wont trigger
[00:26:50] <risto> as i intent
[00:27:14] <risto> but i a add a class using addClas or attr('class','bar') it triggers the click() function
[00:27:20] <risto> am i missing something?
[00:28:44] <shoky> risto: that selector runs only once
[00:29:03] <shoky> and binds the click event for the selected elements
[00:29:08] <risto> okay i see
[00:29:13] <shoky> you probably want to use event delegation
[00:29:18] <risto> so i gotta rerun it when i add a new class?
[00:29:48] <whomp> shoky, won't that stop working when i have to resize it? in which case, i would need an onResize handler
[00:30:01] <whomp> whereas i just want to do this with a simple animate call
[00:30:04] <shoky> risto: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/7NLvc/3/
[00:30:49] <risto> greatastic ! thanks shoky
[00:32:19] <shoky> whomp: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Agjzn/1/
[00:32:49] <whomp> nice, that's perfectly centered?
[00:32:53] <shoky> nah ;P
[00:33:04] <whomp> hehe i was afraid
[00:33:32] <xenaxon> hi, are divs allowed in li elements?
[00:33:44] <whomp> do you know of any way to do this with a simple animate call? or should i just suck it up and add an onresize handler?
[00:34:39] <shoky> whomp: that's what i'd do. there might be a simpler way, and i'm sure there are plugins that help too
[00:38:31] <whomp> ok thanks :)
[00:54:18] <byte_muse> would anyone be interested in giving me feedback on a site I just put up?
[01:44:33] <RichieEvan> anyone know why javascript is invite only?
[01:44:49] <_helpPlz_> hey something wrong with jquery download? 404 not found?
[01:45:45] <NodeX> RichieEvan : prolly spam
[01:47:43] <Cork> _helpPlz_: wfm
[01:49:10] <_helpPlz_> Cork, oh sorry i see now. i enabled jquery.com in noscript and it worked.
[01:52:39] <Cork> RichieEvan: have you tried ##javascript
[01:53:00] <RichieEvan> I haven't is it the same?
[01:53:04] <RichieEvan> #javascript is my fav
[01:53:13] <Cork> # is redirected to ##
[01:53:40] <Cork> but some clients apparently can't handle taht
[01:53:44] <Cork> *that
[01:53:46] <RichieEvan> You need to identify with network services to join the room "##javascript" on "irc.freenode.net".
[01:53:47] <RichieEvan> Server Details:
[01:53:47] <RichieEvan> Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services
[01:54:02] * Cork checks the log
[01:54:53] <Cork> your nick needs to be registered
[01:54:57] <Cork> and its not
[01:55:09] <RichieEvan> o crap
[01:55:13] <RichieEvan> that's right I changed it
[01:55:18] <RichieEvan> <---dumb
[02:51:12] <bjensen12> .on("change") is the same as .change?
[02:51:23] <diverdude> bjensen12: no
[02:51:36] <bjensen12> which is the best performance wise?
[02:51:52] <diverdude> same performance
[02:52:01] <bjensen12> i have a select I need to trigger an event on value change
[02:52:14] <diverdude> use .change
[02:52:20] <bjensen12> why though?
[02:54:35] <diverdude> on is for future added elements
[02:54:42] <diverdude> current and future
[02:55:01] <diverdude> if you have only a single element to which the event can occur, just use .change
[02:55:48] <bjensen12> diverdude:
[02:55:51] <bjensen12> diverdude:  ok thanks
[02:56:06] <diverdude> yw

[03:07:19] <asher^> can anyone recommend a good plugin that does a loading spinner for ajax requests?
[03:08:31] <b0bi> hi, I am trying the following: $('.nav-list > li > a').addClass("active");  and the class does not change, I tried: $('.nav-list > li > a').remove(); and it works, any idea why?
[03:09:45] <NodeX> console.log($('.nav-list > li > a'));
[03:10:18] <b0bi> im trying that now, 10x

[03:17:57] <coldhead> youaaaaareavisitorrrinsideyourbodddy
[03:32:52] <pandu101> Can someone give some advice on how to debug jquery in chrome web tools? Trying to see what my script is doing in the console but cant figure out how to get it going?
[03:33:21] <asher^> http://fixingthesejquery.com
[03:33:38] <asher^> thats by ajpiano
[03:34:24] <pandu101> asher: thanks. I reviewed that but I need more instructions on getting the console to show what my jquery is doing. Those slides dont provide that detail.
[03:34:59] <asher^> can you give an example? maybe make a jsfiddle for it
[03:36:12] <pandu101> Hmmm... well I got a form that does whois check for domain name.
[03:36:36] <pandu101> The form is working fine... except there is a "searching" image that does not go away after the results are shown.
[03:36:47] <pandu101> I wanna use a debugger to see whats going on.
[03:37:02] <pandu101> This way I can also learn to debug jquery...
[03:40:57] <pandu101> here is a screenshot of the "in progress wheel" thats not going away (look to the right) --> http://i.imgur.com/Y802b.png
[03:42:12] <NodeX> pandu101 : what's the problem
[03:43:43] <pandu101> NodeX: I have an image that loads right before an ajax query. And it does not go away even though I issue a remove command in the ajax callback function.
[03:44:06] <pandu101> So I'd like to debug it but dont know how in google chrome.
[03:44:34] <pandu101> So am looking for help on how to load my jquery into chrome.
[03:45:09] <NodeX> pass
[03:45:22] <NodeX> I use firefox to debug because firebug is easier to use inside it
[03:45:23] <pandu101> well - thanks for listening though. :)
[03:45:39] <pandu101> oh ok.
[03:46:31] <pandu101> Lemme google around some more. already did many searches on this... but what the hell maybe page 7 has something..
[03:47:14] <NodeX> dude, save the hassle and install firebug for firefox
[03:47:38] <coldhead> pandu101: this quick tutorial will show you how to chrome OR firebug http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[03:47:50] <coldhead> and it's a thing of beauty and a joy forever
[03:48:13] <pandu101> coldhead: I reviewed the presentation but it did not have the steps. R u sure?
[03:49:16] <pandu101> reviewing it one more time. Maybe i missed it.
[03:49:39] <coldhead> what step do you need?
[03:49:49] <coldhead> load a page that include jQuery and voila, you have jQuery
[03:49:51] <coldhead> case closed
[03:50:07] <pandu101> Yup, thats what I do, but my console does not show it.
[03:50:12] <pandu101> See this image --> http://i.imgur.com/Y802b.png
[03:50:24] <pandu101> my console just shows the ajax requests.
[03:50:53] <coldhead> what about the other tabs?
[03:50:55] <coldhead> network?
[03:50:59] <coldhead> scripts?
[03:51:29] <coldhead> this is a really magnificently dull screenshot, kudos
[03:51:43] <pandu101> LOL. thanks.
[03:52:27] <pandu101> The scripts tab does not show anything. Thats because there is no syntax error. Something else is going on (wish I knew what the heck this 'thing' is)
[03:52:54] <coldhead> try adding the `debugger;` statement to your code, just where you are trying to remove the image
[03:53:10] <coldhead> that will pause the debugger at that point and you can see what's going on
[03:53:27] <pandu101> ok
[03:57:51] <pandu101> hhmmm, adding debugger does something, but not what I expected. Its showing me code that I did not write. ha ha... this is so f'ing funny!
[03:58:15] <pandu101> Actually its not funny.
[03:59:04] <caddoo> I want to add a property to anchors/buttons that will peform a delete so I can an add an onClick event to ask for confirmation
[03:59:09] <caddoo> what html property would you recommend
[04:01:39] <coldhead> $('a,:input').filter(':contains(elete)').click(function () { return confirm('Are you sure?!'); });
[04:02:44] <caddoo> coldhead: 'contains' what does that search
[04:02:53] <caddoo> the html of the element?
[04:04:07] <NodeX> ?contains
[04:04:30] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[04:04:48] <NodeX> sorry
[04:04:49] <NodeX> http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[04:05:07] <caddoo> right
[04:05:36] <caddoo> thanks 75% to coldhead and 25% to NodeX
[04:07:06] <coldhead> great job everybody, take 5
[04:07:22] <fdv> Hi. I have registered a change handler for a form, and when the user changes a value, I add a div to the document showing a message. The problem is that, since the change event doesn't happen until the input field is left, if the user clicks on a button after modifying a text input field, the button event doesn't occur. does anybody know why?
[04:08:45] <fdv> the button event is registered through the .click() function
[04:10:02] <caddoo> NodeX is there a way to ensure that one on click event is always first
[04:10:16] <caddoo> so my delete confirmation should always be first
[04:10:32] <NodeX> can you pastebin your code?
[04:10:38] <NodeX> fdv : try on();
[04:12:09] <caddoo> NodeX: im just testing atm but : http://pastesite.com/39738
[04:12:33] <caddoo> o ignore the return false
[04:12:53] <NodeX> what do you need to happen cadoo >
[04:12:59] <NodeX> > * ?
[04:13:03] <caddoo> i want any other onclick events not to fire
[04:13:08] <caddoo> because I delete via AJAX
[04:13:20] <NodeX> any in the whole site?
[04:13:23] <caddoo> yes
[04:13:31] <caddoo> um no sorry
[04:13:34] <caddoo> on that element
[04:14:24] <caddoo> lets say I have attached a click handler on 'a#my-link' that makes a XHR request to delete something, I want a click handler added to it that can stop this XHR request
[04:17:12] <caddoo> Well it looks like its first come first served with JS, so I just need to make sure my delete click handler comes first
[04:18:10] <libin> how do i call an external json file in html - this is my javascript code that i have written http://pastebin.com/uMWupnv2
[04:18:45] <caddoo> libin: I don't think you can with javascript
[04:19:08] <caddoo> o wait you are using jsonp
[04:19:14] <libin> yes
[04:20:55] <fdv> NodeX: thanks, not sure if that will help, though, as the change event is registered on the form as a whole, while then click is registered on a button
[04:21:04] <fdv> s,then click,the click,
[04:22:02] <fdv> I might need a better understanding of .on(), though, can read up a bit
[04:23:17] <libin> caddoo: Do you suggest any chnages for me?
[04:23:26] <caddoo> libin: i'm looking at it now
[04:23:38] <libin> caddoo: ohh thanks
[04:27:06] <NodeX> sorry, got distracted
[04:27:24] <NodeX> caddoo : look at event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation()
[04:27:31] <caddoo> thank you
[04:27:38] <caddoo> libin: does that api support jsonp
[04:28:16] <caddoo> libin: infact it returns XML not JSON
[04:28:24] <NodeX> preventDefault() stops the default action (i/e folloiwing a link or submitting  form) .. propogation stops the handler propogating to the next bind
[04:28:29] <libin> thats wat i thought actually
[04:28:29] <b-ot> So.. you jQuery guys creating pure JS functions for further reuse in $? I am really concern about future of the web.
[04:28:39] <caddoo> thanks NodeX
[04:28:40] <libin> but if u look into the header type of the document its json
[04:29:01] <caddoo> I see application/xml when I navigate to it libin
[04:29:23] <libin> the document structure is xml.. that i agree
[04:29:53] <libin> but if u goto inspect element and goto network tab and check the header tab of the contacts.js file
[04:29:56] <libin> its json
[04:30:14] <caddoo> sorry what is contacts.js?
[04:30:23] <libin> and internet explorer its showing as pure json too.. i believe u r using chrome
[04:30:45] <libin> thats the name of the json file
[04:31:28] <caddoo> libin: http://imgur.com/bqPmh
[04:39:47] <caddoo> libin: am I missing something or is the server actually returning XML
[04:40:49] <libin> i am checking couple of things.. i am bit confused here.. when you try the url alone it shows as a xml file as you shown
[04:41:19] <libin> caddoo: but when u call it within an web page it shows json
[04:42:43] <caddoo> it returns a 200 status
[04:42:49] <caddoo> but is highlighted as an error in firebug
[04:43:53] <codepython7771> Can anyone tell me why the boxes are not of equal heights in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/7/ ?
[04:44:09] <libin> caddoo: try this http://pastebin.com/wbSQFvM8
[04:44:23] <caddoo> i added ?callback=? to the url and it removed the error
[04:44:35] <caddoo> haha yes what you have as well
[04:45:57] <libin> i tried the callback as well. but i does not give the content
[04:46:27] <libin> caddoo : so u getting the same now, json?
[04:46:34] <caddoo> yes
[04:46:57] <caddoo> where are the API docs
[04:47:08] <caddoo> make sure it supports JSONP before looking at anything else
[04:47:32] <libin> hmm.. i dont understand the question properly
[04:47:47] <libin> but the its hosted in windows azure and i am using web api
[04:48:10] <caddoo> is http://mobileappapi.azurewebsites.net/ yours?
[04:48:19] <libin> yes
[04:48:42] <libin> its a virtual domain from windows azure
[04:48:51] <libin> cloud
[04:53:27] <caddoo> im stumped libin sorry
[04:53:55] <libin> i think i am getting somweher
[04:54:07] <libin> what u said earlier might be right
[04:54:19] <caddoo> about it supported JSONP?
[04:54:32] <libin> jsonp is not supported out of box.. u got do a few workaounds
[04:54:37] <libin> yes
[04:54:39] <caddoo> right
[04:54:56] <libin> thanks anyways
[04:55:11] <libin> not sure if thats the error.. but will give it a try
[04:57:30] <caddoo> NodeX: I think i have misunderstood, tried this but both still run :S http://jsfiddle.net/24cFH/
[04:57:34] <libin> caddoo : infact u r right http://www.matlus.com/jsonpmediatypeformatter-web-api-jsonp/
[05:00:30] <cusco> Web Apps
[05:00:43] <cusco> oops
[05:06:35] <nFFF> caddoo urdoinitwrong
[05:06:45] <caddoo> seems that way
[05:06:51] <nFFF> stopPropogation stops the event from bubbling up the DOM tree
[05:06:59] <nFFF> not for duplicae events on same element
[05:07:23] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/24cFH/1/
[05:13:01] <caddoo> thanks nFFF
[05:35:22] <codepython7771> Can anyone tell me why the boxes are not of equal heights in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/7/ ?
[05:41:28] <Woet> codepython7771: where is your code calling equalHeights?
[05:41:42] <Woet> you defined the function, you didn't call it
[05:43:40] <nFFF> You copyrighted that code, lol :D
[05:45:47] <codepython7771> Woet: oops!
[05:46:00] <dabear> codepython7771: there are paddings defined
[05:46:27] <dabear> so if you call equalheights() on the two divs, their heights will both be 328 px
[05:46:46] <dabear> but the rightmost div will have a padding of 16px on top and bottom
[05:47:09] <dabear> so the rightmost div will be 32px taller
[05:55:27] <codepython7771> dabear: can you show me how to do this correctly please?
[05:55:41] <dabear> do what correctly?
[05:56:04] <codepython7771> The two boxes with equal heights and correct padding?
[05:56:20] <dabear> remove the padding on the box to the right
[05:56:44] <codepython7771> dabear: but then the text looks ugly in the box?
[05:57:45] <dabear> then add padding on the left box instead?
[05:58:06] <codepython7771> can you show me please?
[05:58:09] <dabear> or set the height of the left box to +32
[05:58:29] <dabear> we are here to help, not to do it for you
[06:00:16] <dabear> or find an implementation of the equalHeights() function that considers paddings and margins as well
[06:03:07] <codepython7771> dabear: do you know of such a function? any pointers on the web for that?
[06:03:26] <jarr0dsz> hi jquery experts. im trying to reload the contents of a div and it works great
[06:03:35] <dabear> nope, googleit?
[06:03:46] <jarr0dsz> http://pastie.org/private/t95dzi5cd0vgyn4hvplxw only problem it is to "slow" it has some small delay is it possible to increase the speed of a replacement of div contents?
[06:03:46] <dabear> jarr0dsz: so what'ws the problem?
[06:04:16] <jarr0dsz> actually im replacing the full contents of my page with another layout and contens i would like to know it I can change faster, like preload the contents then switch it?
[06:05:04] <jarr0dsz> also main page layout is white the changed layout is black, so you see it "Builds" the page it takes about 1 second for it to be completely changed to the new layout hard to explain
[06:05:28] <dabear> jarr0dsz: use .get(url, callback), add the contents to an in memory div, then remove contents from body and replace with the in memory div
[06:05:43] <dabear> jarr0dsz: you sohuld never replace the whole page contents though
[06:05:58] <jarr0dsz> dabear: i thought so it was just a quick test if something like that could work ;) and it did ;p
[06:06:20] <jarr0dsz> .get(url,callback) and store it in a hidden "memory" div ?
[06:06:22] <dabear> yeah, but as you noticed, it doesn't perform too well
[06:06:41] <jarr0dsz> no indeed.. dabear i have to note the problem is a -little- bit more difficult but your idea could work still
[06:06:42] <dabear> yep, a div you assign to a variable
[06:07:03] <jarr0dsz> a background process in my webapp reloads the page, by sending data stream over websockets, then the jquery part is called
[06:07:13] <jarr0dsz> but that should not be a problem
[06:07:20] <dabear> ok, you could use backbone.js
[06:07:42] <jarr0dsz> i think it would pre-load the contents in the hidden div than replace the whole page contents with it
[06:09:08] <jarr0dsz> would like to keep it as simple as possible at first dabear im not that good in jquery could you maybe give some more info on the proposed method you gave?
[06:09:29] <jarr0dsz> like assign content to a hidden div
[06:09:45] <dabear> i didn't say a hidden div
[06:09:50] <jarr0dsz> i wonder if that woudent give any problems in the html and jquery plugins.. since you would get divs and classes in there that plugins might trigger
[06:10:00] <dabear> i said a div you assign to a variable
[06:10:08] <dabear> and then add to the body
[06:10:11] <jarr0dsz> an in memory div?
[06:10:24] <jarr0dsz> ah like that just store the whole page contents in a var? thats possible?
[06:10:38] <dabear> rule 1) you do not ever include js in what you .load()
[06:10:39] <cusco> if I am to take the class 'current' from a <li> and place it on another <li>, do I need to use .each() to remove from all ?
[06:10:57] <dabear> jarr0dsz: yep
[06:11:13] <jarr0dsz> dabear: how would that look codewise in jquery? sounds very interesting
[06:11:28] <dabear> cusco: yes, or just .prev or .prevAll()
[06:11:37] <asher^> what syntax do i need to use in jquery to create a document fragment?
[06:11:37] <jarr0dsz> i could hook a special layout in webapp to remove all the js stuff I already have that implemented :)
[06:11:52] <codepython7771> dabear: what am i doing wrong in calling the function: http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/8/ ?
[06:11:54] <dabear> $.get(url, function(data){  var $page = $(data);  })
[06:12:45] <dabear> codepython7771: you have no idea whatsoever how jquery works. solving this problem for you does not teach you anything. you shoul rather begin with the basic tutorials
[06:12:47] <codepython7771> I tried both "#" and "." for selecting
[06:13:17] <codepython7771> dabear: I am trying to understand the basics, while solving this problem. And indeed this is my first jquery example.
[06:13:18] <jarr0dsz> dabear: thx ok so its inside @page then use  $('#layout').load($page); ?
[06:13:53] <dabear> jarr0dsz: whaat? @page? what is that?
[06:13:53] <pachet> codepython7771: do you understand what # and . mean?
[06:14:07] <jarr0dsz> dabear: sorry @page the page var
[06:14:13] <jarr0dsz> sorry $ arghh
[06:14:25] <jarr0dsz> different programming languates im used to @ goes automatic
[06:14:44] <dabear> just $("#layout").append($page)
[06:14:54] <cusco> dabear: can't I just use $(".class").removeClass()
[06:14:56] <cusco> ?
[06:14:57] <dabear> or .empty().append($page)
[06:15:35] <dabear> cusco: yep you could do that, but that might (potentially) match several other elements that is not a sibling to the current li
[06:15:48] <jarr0dsz> dabear: okay .empty would clear the contents first right.. i try thx alot dabear!
[06:16:01] <codepython7771> Can anyone tell me please how do i call the equalheights() function in this example correctly -- > http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/9/
[06:17:20] <cusco> dabear: thats ok, I will get a specific classname
[06:17:35] <dabear> jarr0dsz: but if you do this on .click for example, the request to fetch the page would still take an equal amount of time. so you would still experience a "delay" there
[06:17:45] <dabear> jarr0dsz: unless you do some preloading etc
[06:18:09] <jarr0dsz> dabear: im only using it on reload this action not triggered bu user intervention
[06:19:22] <jarr0dsz> dabear: only does not work yet i get error in firebug did i miss someting ?http://pastie.org/private/t8zmdmzij3iqtf5veu4gca
[06:19:24] <dabear> jarr0dsz: also, serverside, you can check if a request comes from an ajax call and by doign that NOT including any unneccessary text, such as scripts, and the entire <head></head
[06:19:50] <nFFF> codepython7771 seriously
[06:19:52] <jarr0dsz> $page is not defined, yes im using layouts for that its a ruby on rails app im working on, i have a layout without head and js
[06:19:57] <nFFF> uncopyright your code
[06:20:01] <nFFF> and go read some docs
[06:20:08] <codepython7771> Thats what i am doing
[06:20:08] <nFFF> your doing it totally wrong
[06:20:09] <dabear> jarr0dsz: callbacks are there for a reason
[06:20:14] <dabear> they are called later
[06:20:21] <codepython7771> And its not my code, or else i wud know how to call it
[06:20:22] <nFFF> perhaps this plugin is not the best task for you right now
[06:20:43] <codepython7771> nFFF: I want to make the left/right boxes of equal height
[06:20:48] <nFFF> I know
[06:20:56] <jarr0dsz> ahd so i place the get method after the load ? i switch th e2 lines you mean
[06:21:03] <dabear> jarr0dsz: nope
[06:21:05] <codepython7771> nFFF: how do i even call the function correctly on the outerbox?
[06:21:15] <dabear> you do the appending inside the callback
[06:21:28] <nFFF> That function is called on an object, not passed an object
[06:21:39] <nFFF> $('.foo').equalHeights()
[06:21:46] <jarr0dsz> hmm that goes beyoung my jquery skills i dont understand
[06:21:47] <nFFF> but Im assuming you have to pass multiple selectors to it
[06:21:53] <codepython7771> nFFF: I tried Â Â  $("div#outerbox").equalHeights; -- didnt work
[06:21:54] <jarr0dsz> appending inside the callback
[06:22:15] <nFFF> codepython7771 you are new to jquery right?
[06:22:21] <nFFF> how about javascript?
[06:22:26] <dabear> function(data){  var $page = $(data);  ....append($page)}
[06:22:32] <codepython7771> yes. Here is what i tried: $(document).ready(function() {Â  $("div#outerbox").equalHeights(); });
[06:22:50] <jarr0dsz> dabear: you mean this http://pastie.org/private/vzajcm6v38vca8sznzblg ?
[06:23:03] <nFFF> codepython7771, its time to do some learning first
[06:23:07] <dabear> codepython7771: you would need to select the divs inside the container div
[06:23:12] <nFFF> go read jquery docs,practise some exmaples
[06:23:51] <dabear> jarr0dsz: yep
[06:23:57] <jarr0dsz> dabear: i think this is ok now thx alot, it goes a lot faster indeed
[06:24:19] <jarr0dsz> dabear: could you make it even more faster? im not sure have to test it but i go from white layout to black layout and you can see still some lagg
[06:24:20] <codepython7771> nFFF: please feel free to point me to pages that you think i should read.
[06:24:27] <codepython7771> dabear: thanks
[06:24:31] <nFFF> ?jquery @ codepython7771
[06:24:31] <jarr0dsz> dabear: although its much better than before
[06:24:33] <bot-t> codepython7771, jquery: A string containing the jQuery version number. http://api.jquery.com/jquery/
[06:24:49] <nFFF> that whole site :D
[06:25:09] <dabear> jarr0dsz: $page.hide().appendTo("body").show()
[06:25:49] <dabear> appendTo("#layout") sry
[06:26:53] <jarr0dsz> dabear: if im doing     $page.hide().appendTo("#layout").show() then the "old" content is left on the screen. i tried adding empty() in but that does not work
[06:27:10] <jarr0dsz> i do need the old content to be wiped out completly else i get one bigg mess ;p
[06:29:30] <jarr0dsz> this seem to work http://pastie.org/private/sdewzefgfs4nlusbrikyw
[06:29:37] <jarr0dsz> not sure if thats the best way to code it in jquery
[06:29:48] <jarr0dsz> but thx i keep that for now unless someone has some suggestions :)
[06:30:05] <nFFF> ?replacewith @ jarr0dsz
[06:30:06] <bot-t> jarr0dsz, .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[06:31:05] <jarr0dsz> so then     $page.hide().replaceWith("#layout").show()
[06:31:13] <jarr0dsz> ah no thats wrong ;p
[06:31:18] <dabear> nFFF: nope, that would just switch the contents with new contents
[06:31:28] <dabear> he wants a more "fluid" experience
[06:31:38] <dabear> or something if I didn't completely misunderstand
[06:32:14] <nFFF> $('#layout').replaceWith($data)
[06:33:13] <codepython7771> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/10/ -- At last i could call it ! now need to fix the padding/margin problem
[06:33:44] <nFFF> :) gl
[06:33:47] <jarr0dsz> ok tried both i dont see a speed difference, wich one would be faster then a) $page.hide().appendTo("#layout").show() or b)     $('#layout').replaceWith($page) ?
[06:33:59] <dabear> same speed
[06:34:00] <nFFF> who gives a fuck about speed
[06:34:06] <nFFF> which is easiest to read?
[06:38:30] <codepython7771> Is 1em always equal to 16 pixels?
[06:38:42] <nlogax> No
[06:39:47] <nlogax> 1em is the current point size. In <p>Hello <span>em</span></p>, "em" would be twice as big if you use p span { font-size: 2em }
[06:40:18] <nlogax> I think 16px is the default font size in most browser stylesheets
[06:40:37] <codepython7771> nlogax: how can i fix this: http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/11/
[06:41:34] <codepython7771> the padding is making the boxes non-equal height. One way to fix this is to add exact number of pixels to the left box. But isnt that going to be a problem?
[06:44:01] <nlogax> codepython7771: Dunno what the ideal solution is, but you can: add a wrapper element, try outerHeight(), use same padding on all elements that should be equal.. or do it in CSS
[06:44:18] <pandu101> hey all. The foll command is not working, but Im not getting any errors either: --> $('img[src="ajax-loader.gif"]').remove();
[06:44:49] <codepython7771> nlogax: i tried using a padding on all elements in the CSS. but then the boxes touch each other. how can i fix that?
[06:45:51] <nlogax> pandu101: If $('img[src="ajax-loader.gif"]') returns an empty set, it is not an error to call such methods. It will remove all 0 of them :) Check in your debugger what it returns, maybe you want [src$="ajax-loader.gif"] to check if it ends with that, or some such?
[06:46:52] <nlogax> codepython7771: Fiddle width that max-width: 70% maybe?
[06:47:43] <pandu101> nlogax: I cant seem to get the debugger to work in chrome. thanks for the tip though.
[06:48:22] <pandu101> wait, I can call an alert on that.
[06:49:10] <codepython7771> nlogax: http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/12/
[06:49:47] <codepython7771> still cant get it right
[06:54:00] <nlogax> codepython7771: Looks like they are the same height, but on the logo you have the shadow and stuff on the inner <img> element
[06:55:11] <codepython7771> nlogax: if i remove it, things dont change
[06:56:56] <pandu101> nlogax: ran alert($('img[src="ajax-loader.gif"]')) and I get [object object]. So it does not seem to be finding images. or does it?
[06:57:14] <codepython7771> nlogax: if i remove both padding:1em on logo+desc, the height becomes equal
[06:57:21] <nlogax> pandu101: It always returns an object, try $('img[src="ajax-loader.gif"]').length
[06:57:59] <pandu101> oh - ok. got it. Thx.
[06:59:03] <nlogax> codepython7771: This gets equal height for me http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/14/
[06:59:10] <pandu101> well that answers it. it finds 0 elements, so it cant remove it.
[06:59:11] <codepython7771> nlogax: http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/15/
[06:59:16] <nlogax> But there's some CSS oddity going on :)
[06:59:53] <codepython7771> nlogax: http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/14/ -- anything i can clean in this solution?
[06:59:56] <nlogax> codepython7771: That too is equal here
[07:00:29] <nlogax> codepython7771: But I just noticed something, you aren't waiting for the image to load before getting the height.
[07:00:47] <nlogax> codepython7771: So you might get different results depending on if the image is cached or not
[07:01:12] <codepython7771> oops
[07:01:21] <codepython7771> how do i fix that?
[07:03:15] <nlogax> You can use $(window).load(fn) to wait for images and stuff to load, it will of course be slower
[07:03:36] <crivera> is it possible to do any client side validation of the credit card security code? Other than just checking that it's 3 digits (4 for amex)
[07:06:11] <pandu101> nlogax: Thanks for the great tip! I was able to fix the issue! Feel Great!
[07:06:18] <nlogax> pandu101: Yay!
[07:07:29] <codepython7771> nlogax: http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/16/ -- what am i doing wrong?
[07:07:59] <codepython7771> nlogax: document ready works, but window load doesnt for some reason ?
[07:08:54] <nlogax> codepython7771: Hmm, I thnk it's jsfiddle's "onLoad" option, try changing that to "no wrap (head)"
[07:09:16] <nlogax> I guess it always ran your code on load anyway, even when you used read()
[07:09:18] <nlogax> +y
[07:12:07] <codepython7771> nlogax: http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/17/ is this what you meant?
[07:13:05] <nlogax> codepython7771: Yes
[07:13:10] <codepython7771> nlogax: it doesnt really work! If you scale the rendering window, you'll see the problem. The boxes change height
[07:13:27] <codepython7771> nlogax: i guess we should hook it into any resize somehow?
[07:13:33] <nlogax> codepython7771: Ohhh, yeah. But it's correct the first time, right? Yeah exactly
[07:14:18] <codepython7771> nlogax: http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/18/
[07:14:33] <codepython7771> nlogax: something is wrong still.
[07:15:03] <codepython7771> on resizing the boxes dont keep equal height
[07:17:21] <codepython7771> nlogax: any thoughts?
[07:17:51] <nlogax> codepython7771: Are you using the webkit inspector, or firebug or something similar? If you inspect the .logo element, you will see that it has a height set, which is the same as on #desc. But when the width of .logo changes, the width of the image changes and the height changes proportionally. So .logo and #desc are still the same height, but the img sticks out of .logo
[07:19:06] <codepython7771> nlogax: any ideas how to fix that?
[07:24:23] <Whirl3d_> Morning all. Is there any trick to knowing whether you have loaded content (via load or ajax) already or should I just keep a list of content loaded urls?
[07:24:42] <codepython7771> nlogax: i see different heights inside firfox inspector
[07:25:23] <codepython7771> nlogax: this is the html i was using: http://bpaste.net/show/5DWOmOfUgeQqNadELRD1/
[07:26:20] <nlogax> codepython7771: Are you looking at the outer div? Noticed now that you have the .logo class on the <img>, too
[07:27:37] <defaultro> hey folks, do you think I will benefit from this training if I am basic javascript foundation or will it be too advance for me? http://training.bocoup.com/comprehensive-jquery/
[07:27:51] <codepython7771> nlogax: in my case both of them have 334 px height, but the text box is around 130px height
[07:30:25] <defaultro> hey folks, I lost all my bookmarks. Can somone please provide me a really good link to jquery tutorial? Something that can give me a solid foundation
[07:31:17] <codepython7771> nlogax: perhaps the outerbox does not update when things are resized?
[07:31:32] <codepython7771> nah -- i've no clue
[07:32:46] <codepython7771> nlogax: it works on onload() but not on resize() -- http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/19/ -- tells me that this has something to do with outerbox?
[07:34:23] <codepython7771> dabear: http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/19/ -- any ideas how to fix this on resize?
[07:37:54] <defaultro> anyone please
[07:39:38] <pandu101> Trying to incorporate the fadein effect. So changed from: $("#res").append(result); -- to --> $("#res").fadein('slow', result);  But its not working and there is no error.
[07:40:43] <Whirl3d_> Who gave you the idea that fadein took two parameters and one of them was the content you wanted to append to the elementyou are fading in?
[07:41:38] <pandu101> whirl3d: good point. I quickly looked at the syntax and just started trying stuff.
[07:41:58] <Whirl3d_> Right, but you will learn a lot more by actually reading the shit.
[07:42:04] <pandu101> lol
[07:42:29] <Whirl3d_> fadein takes a time ('or speed') parameter and a couple of other options. You hide the element, append the content, then fadein
[07:42:52] <pandu101> ahhhh. that makes sense.
[07:42:57] <Whirl3d_> defaultro, what os are you using?
[07:43:06] <pandu101> k, lemme try it. thanks.

[07:48:54] <Whirl3d_> I see. Wieird that fiddle doesn't fire resize on the iframe content
[07:49:09] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: change the width of the frame?
[07:49:34] <codepython7771> + the height of the right box is a little bigger than the left even onload
[07:49:48] <Whirl3d_> didn't affect it. But changing the overall browser did. I think you need to keep the value for maxheight out of the function
[07:50:13] <Whirl3d_> when you assign var maxHeight=0; that happens each time...so each element is going to set maxheight to 0 and then to it's height
[07:50:34] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/2JRbe/20/
[07:50:36] <Whirl3d_> maybe?
[07:50:48] <Whirl3d_> nope
[07:50:56] <defaultro> what does document mean from the code -> $(document).ready(function(){
[07:51:10] <defaultro> is it the document object?
[07:51:30] <Whirl3d_> also, no need to wrap this in $(this) inside your plugin
[07:51:58] <codepython7771> k
[07:52:31] <Whirl3d_> plus your code only works if they are progressively heighted...
[07:52:33] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: your onload() seems to work.
[07:52:49] <pachet> defaultro: yes
[07:52:55] <defaultro> k
[07:53:04] <Whirl3d_> if the first one is the tallest, you are set. If the second one is the tallest, the first one never gets resized.
[07:53:16] <Whirl3d_> so you should first map the maxheight value then apply it.
[07:53:36] <codepython7771> two passes then?
[07:53:42] <defaultro> pachet, I am thinking of attending the 3 day comprehensive jquery training by Bocoup. I have basic javascript knowledge. Do you think I'll be fine?
[07:54:29] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: I thought the maxheight is calculated over all elements and then applied to a particular one?
[07:54:38] <pachet> defaultro: ask ben_alman, he teaches the course
[07:54:48] <pachet> defaultro: he can give you a rundown on just how in-depth they'll be going
[07:55:13] <defaultro> how do I reach him?
[07:55:38] <defaultro> oh, he is here :D
[07:55:41] <pachet> just pm him, that's his nick on freenode
[07:55:42] <pachet> yeah
[07:55:45] <defaultro> :D
[07:57:23] <pandu101> Whirl3d: Got that fadeIn effect working. Thanks for the tip man!
[07:57:49] <Whirl3d_> np.
[07:58:39] <defaultro> pachet, what times are he usually here? Does he chat here too?
[07:59:06] <Whirl3d_> codepython7771, I think, there's a better way to handle this.
[07:59:46] <Whirl3d_> since you have the divs inside another div, why not make them autoexpand to take up the full height of the surrounding div (minus margin);
[08:00:34] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: Can you please do a jsfiddle with your suggestion. I am new to these things, and need to even pick up the basics.
[08:07:10] <pachet> defaultro: he's probably afk, and no he doesn't chat much
[08:10:26] <defaultro> k. I emailed him too
[08:10:48] <defaultro> i really need this training so I can support our application :(
[08:11:00] <defaultro> i am reading this now. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:How_jQuery_Works
[08:11:22] <defaultro> i was told our contractors will be gone in early 2013. I really need to become an expert in jquery
[08:13:24] <Stephen> defaultro: How well are you versed in Javascript?
[08:13:33] <defaultro> i have basic understanding
[08:13:42] <defaultro> i usually pull codes from internet
[08:13:49] <defaultro> then I disect them
[08:14:09] <Whirl3d_> codepython7771, this is definitely a css issue.
[08:14:15] <Stephen> What kind of project do you use jquery in?
[08:14:17] <Whirl3d_> I hate css and really suck at it.
[08:14:18] <defaultro> maybe Stephen, I am more than basic
[08:14:53] <Whirl3d_> I'd suggest asking the folks at CSS (like I just did). They might have a better answer for you.
[08:15:29] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: can you please fix my heights function?
[08:15:30] <Whirl3d_> one thing for sure, don't make your logo image holding div the same class as you logo image.
[08:15:34] <Whirl3d_> no
[08:15:59] <Whirl3d_> There is something else going on with your code that makes it not work.
[08:16:17] <Whirl3d_> When I wrote the code to fix the heights, they would report the same height and still be off.
[08:16:25] <Whirl3d_> that's the evil doings of css
[08:16:49] <codepython7771> can you paste that code?
[08:16:55] <Whirl3d_> Maybe try innerHeight or come up with a better function to determine height?
[08:17:26] <Whirl3d_> Look through the log and you'll see the last fiddle I pasted. It shows clearly that both divs are reporting the same height even though one is shorter than the other
[08:18:35] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/2JRbe/25/
[08:20:20] <defaultro> what is fn from this code ->  $.fn.equalHeights = function() {
[08:20:26] <defaultro> where is it coming from?
[08:21:18] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: thx
[08:22:40] <Stephen> defaultro: $.fm is just a convenient namespace for custom functions
[08:22:44] <Stephen> It's nothing special
[08:22:59] <Whirl3d_> $.fn=$.prototype
[08:25:04] <Whirl3d_> codepython7771, I'd use a gd table
[08:25:05] <pachet> basically it allows you to add methods to the jquery object, as Whirl3d_ said
[08:25:35] <pachet> so if you do $.fn.pokemonBattle = function(){--> then you can call that on any object returned from $
[08:25:56] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: whats a gd table?
[08:26:12] <Whirl3d_> short for gosh darn table.
[08:26:29] <codepython7771> lol k
[08:27:20] <defaultro> so fn is just a string and doesn't have to exist first?
[08:27:25] <Whirl3d_> 50 lines of code including extending the jquery fn object just to get something that a table will do in 3 lines
[08:27:38] <Whirl3d_> really, This table-bashing bullshit is out of hand.
[08:28:04] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: I'll try the 3 liner then
[08:28:33] <defaultro> so $.fn.equalHeights from the code $.fn.equalHeights = function() { mean, you are assigning fn.equalstring as function?
[08:28:43] <Stephen> yup
[08:28:51] <defaultro> k
[08:29:15] <Stephen> Whirl3d_: Tables are there if you need 'em. Anyone who hates on it, fuck 'em
[08:29:18] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: so just make a table with two cells and load the image centered in the left cell? I've not used tables for a long time...
[08:29:30] <defaultro> what about this one -> $(document).ready(function(){
[08:29:51] <Stephen> defaultro: Anything inside that function will be run once the page finishes rendering
[08:30:09] <Stephen> Or, rather, when jquery finishes loading
[08:30:23] <defaultro> i mean, how is it different from the first code I posted  earlier?
[08:30:44] <defaultro> i see though, there is no equal sign
[08:31:00] <pachet> .ready() is a function that you're calling
[08:31:09] <Stephen> Ok, so $.fn.methodName is just a way of assigning a method to a global namespace
[08:31:28] <Stephen> $(document).ready(function(){ is used to run code on page ready.
[08:31:30] <defaultro> so ready is the function,
[08:31:51] <pachet> javascript -> first class functions
[08:32:05] <pachet> so you'll see a lot of functions take other functions as their arguments
[08:32:06] <defaultro> ok. what happens if we remove parenthese from document? what is it enclosed?
[08:32:21] <Stephen> Not sure if you've spent any time in .Net, but $(document).ready() ( shorthand $(function(){ }) ) is basically PageLoad
[08:32:30] <defaultro> no, i did not
[08:32:32] <pachet> defaultro: that's another function
[08:32:56] <Stephen> so $() is a jquery element or object wrapper
[08:33:02] <defaultro> k
[08:33:08] <pachet> no, that's misleading
[08:33:10] <pachet> $() is a function
[08:33:20] <Stephen> $("body") gets you the body element, but the object returned is a jquery object, not just the element
[08:33:21] <pachet> it RETURNS what Stephen said
[08:33:34] <defaultro> these are the things I need to learn
[08:33:44] <defaultro> is that covered in "Getting started"?
[08:33:46] <Stephen> so $(document) gets you the current document, in jquery format
[08:34:19] <Stephen> defaultro: Are you familiar with document.getElementById, or document.querySelector ?
[08:34:28] <defaultro> the former, I know
[08:34:31] <defaultro> i used it in javascript
[08:34:36] <Stephen> $() is basically that
[08:34:38] <Whirl3d_> css sucks so bad. I wish there was a different standard. An alternative that didn't suck the fucking life out of me every day
[08:34:40] <Stephen> it can do a lot more
[08:35:10] <Stephen> ?!
[08:35:13] <Stephen> Bah
[08:35:17] <Stephen> Don't listen to that
[08:35:29] <Stephen> jquery uses css selectors in order to locate elements
[08:35:47] <defaultro> oh
[08:36:02] <Stephen> Suggestion: Installl Mozilla Firefox, then add the Firebug Extension
[08:36:06] <defaultro> how can $() be equal to document.getElementById?
[08:36:08] <Stephen> This will get you a javascript console
[08:36:13] <defaultro> i am still lost
[08:36:15] <Stephen> Just start throwing commands at it
[08:36:25] <pachet> defaultro: its not
[08:36:30] <Stephen> Seriously, get firefox and firebug
[08:36:48] <defaultro> i am using firefox and firebug for debugging
[08:37:01] <defaultro> but not the advance debugging
[08:37:07] <pachet> defaultro: when you call $('#foo'), you're telling jquery you want the element with id 'foo', but enclosed in an object wrapper that allows you to call jquery methods on it
[08:37:20] <Stephen> Cool, then open http://www.jquery.com
[08:37:23] <Stephen> Open the console
[08:37:28] <defaultro> k
[08:37:33] <defaultro> got it pachet
[08:37:35] <pachet> if you just did document.getElementById('foo').height(50), you'd get an error, obviously
[08:37:35] <Stephen> and start throwing these commands at it
[08:37:39] <defaultro> Stephen, I will open it now
[08:38:00] <defaultro> ok, console enabled
[08:38:06] <pachet> the whole point of jquery is to add some useful utility functions that allow you to manipulate the dom without worrying about cross-browser issues and other complications
[08:38:19] <defaultro> dom is also what I want to learn
[08:38:36] <defaultro> i see the variables under DOM tab in firebug but I dont understand it
[08:38:47] <pachet> i'd recommend getting a solid foundational understanding of DOM and dom manip in regular JS parlance before tackling jquery
[08:39:01] <pachet> otherwise you won't really know what you're gaining from abstraction
[08:39:10] <defaultro> that means, I sshould not take the 3 day comprehensive training
[08:39:22] <Stephen> Hmm
[08:39:26] <pachet> depends on when it is and how much you can learn before then
[08:39:30] <pachet> :[
[08:39:34] <defaultro> that's true
[08:39:39] <Stephen> You need a solid foundation of Javascript for a jquery class to be any help
[08:39:47] <defaultro> we can tell now from my knowledge, I am not ready for it
[08:39:55] <defaultro> :(
[08:40:13] <Stephen> defaultro: Use this:
[08:40:13] <Stephen> http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0
[08:40:16] <defaultro> k
[08:40:31] <Stephen> Once you've finished that, come back to jquery classes
[08:40:45] <defaultro> very cool!!!
[08:40:58] <defaultro> that's javascript?
[08:42:05] <defaultro> do you think guys if I do this everyday which I have been already doing for 2 weeks, I'll be better in 3 months?
[08:42:14] <Stephen> Yeha
[08:42:16] <defaultro> k
[08:42:25] <Stephen> Javascript isn't extremely difficult to pick up
[08:42:35] <defaultro> yup, I understand it
[08:42:40] <defaultro> i've written some
[08:42:49] <defaultro> but the DOM part
[08:43:29] <defaultro> i've also used other people's code then I reuse them such as ajax call to php
[08:44:21] <defaultro> this is nice tutorial Stephen :)
[08:44:36] <defaultro> somewhat similar to Ruby that I saw back in 2009
[08:52:59] <thomaslindstr_m_> Hi, I have an input field inside a parent div that is hidden by .hide(), and a $("input").focus. When the parent div is .show(), the input field gives no response to the focus function. What is the problem?
[08:56:41] <pachet> you're calling .focus() after .show(), right?
[08:57:26] <thomaslindstr_m_> Well, no, does that make any difference? The input is already in the HTML.
[08:57:41] <thomaslindstr_m_> I can try calling the focus() after show()
[09:01:01] <thomaslindstr_m_> Ahh, thanks, pachet. It worked!
[09:01:59] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: http://jsfiddle.net/2JRbe/54/ -- trying the table solution
[09:10:21] <bharath> I am new to jquery development , can anyone suggest some good first bug to work on?
[09:11:16] <pachet> the bugs will come on their own
[09:12:06] <pachet> bharath: do you know javascript?
[09:12:17] <bharath> pachet: yeah
[09:15:13] <bharath> pachet: I am familiar with javascript
[09:16:56] <iheartjs> bharath: might be a question for #jquery-dev
[09:17:47] <pachet> doubtful
[09:18:00] <pachet> bharath: there's lots of good 'intro to jquery' tutorials floating around out there
[09:18:19] <pachet> or you can try converting your old scripts to leverage jquery
[09:18:34] <iheartjs> pachet: I think what they mean is they want to contribute to jquery
[09:18:43] <iheartjs> pachet: at least that's how I understood the question
[09:18:46] <pachet> oh
[09:19:09] <bharath> pachet: iheartjs is correct
[09:20:20] <pachet> then i apologize
[09:20:51] <pachet> iheartjs's initial suggestion is a good one - hang out a bit in #jquery-dev and catch wind of current priorities
[09:21:03] <pachet> or also http://forum.jquery.com/developing-jquery-core
[09:28:49] <defaultro> i noticed in javascript, the leftmost is the object that we want to work on followed by the function
[09:29:05] <defaultro> most likely oop
[09:30:29] <pachet> not exactly sure what that means
[09:30:33] <pachet> but im guessing you mean property access
[09:30:37] <pachet> foo.bar()
[09:30:53] <pachet> in which case, its not by virtue of bar being a function that its placed there
[09:31:02] <pachet> rather by virtue of being a property assigned to the object foo
[09:31:51] <defaultro> yea
[09:31:59] <defaultro> "pachet:.length
[09:32:11] <defaultro> "pachet".length
[09:32:50] <defaultro> that code in js, how is that written in jquery?
[09:33:12] <iheartjs> defaultro: exactly the same
[09:33:23] <defaultro> k
[09:33:29] <iheartjs> defaultro: jquery is javascript
[09:33:54] <iheartjs> defaultro: it's a library to help with DOM manipulations, AJAX requests, etc
[09:34:03] <defaultro> k
[09:34:08] <iheartjs> defaultro: if you want to check the length of a jQuery object though, note it's .length()
[09:34:18] <defaultro> ah
[09:35:13] <iheartjs> actually I may be thinking of size(), length is a property iirc
[09:35:44] <pachet> that's correct
[09:35:49] <pachet> .size(), .length
[09:40:36] <defaultro> http://pastebin.com/wtak0bVr - here is one snippet that our contractor wrote that I don't understand. Is it advance coding?
[09:42:24] <Stephen> defaultro: The code you posted there is most likely used to make an html list act as a dropdown
[09:42:58] <defaultro> k
[09:43:00] <sunbeam> hi, does anyone know how I can get all wall posts from a certain facebook page (page can be viewed without logging in) with a certain ID?
[09:43:13] <defaultro> the code looks very greek to me :) I don't get it
[09:43:53] <defaultro> looks like the one enclosed in single codes are selectors
[09:43:56] <Stephen> sunbeam: /j #facebook-dev
[09:43:57] <defaultro> single quotes
[09:44:07] <Whirl3d_> it simply takes the current active menu element and slides its content up. Then slides down the new acctive content
[09:44:22] <sunbeam> Stephen: nobody in channel
[09:44:25] <Stephen> single and double quotes are the same thing, don't let that throw you
[09:44:26] <defaultro> Stephen, can you say it's advance programming?
[09:44:39] <defaultro> the way he wrote it?
[09:44:54] <Stephen> He wrote it the right way
[09:45:01] <defaultro> k
[09:45:16] <Stephen> I wouldn't say it's highly advanced, this is pretty standard stuff for jquery
[09:45:28] <defaultro> ok. I wish I'll understand it in near future
[09:45:40] <Whirl3d_> that's why you pay a contractor
[09:45:45] <Stephen> basically he's got some resultSet
[09:45:59] <Stephen> He finds the selected item in that result set
[09:46:02] <defaultro> Whirl3d_, but I am willing to become an expert on it
[09:46:11] <Whirl3d_> at whose expense?
[09:46:15] <defaultro> beome the local expert
[09:46:16] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: any comments on how to fix this -- http://jsfiddle.net/4cHSY/15/ ?
[09:46:20] <defaultro> Whirl3d_, company
[09:46:24] <Stephen> lol, Whirl3d_, play nice
[09:46:54] <defaultro> i know i can do it but it will take time
[09:47:19] <Stephen> defaultro: What don't you understand about the code he has written there?
[09:47:38] <Whirl3d_> I guess what I am trying to get at is that it is unreasonable to expect the generous folks in here to _teach_ you jquery and javascript.
[09:47:57] <Whirl3d_> codepython7771, what's the issue?
[09:47:57] <defaultro> unfortunately, about 95% of it. I am shocked with the syntax
[09:48:14] <Stephen> Ok, so do you understand Fluent coding yet?]
[09:48:25] <defaultro> Whirl3d_, that's why I am working myself to become better at jquery
[09:48:29] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: It doesnt even look close to -- http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/2JRbe/20/ ?
[09:48:35] <defaultro> yes, I've done programming
[09:48:59] <defaultro> i write the php side of our app and some jquery I find from web :)
[09:49:12] <defaultro> but those code like his, scares me
[09:49:24] <defaultro> but would love to do it too
[09:49:51] <defaultro> I don't know if it's a problem. THe app is so huge, written by different programmers for 4 years
[09:50:02] <defaultro> i just came in 3 months ago
[09:50:14] <Whirl3d_> codepython, I think I would approach this from a strong arm perspective: That is to say that you can build the divs to be the exact height you want every time you refresh or load the screen. Give me a minute to play with it some more and I'll see what I can do.
[09:50:33] <Stephen> Ok, so that code takes a result set, finds a single item from that set, checks to see if that item is already active. If not, it sets all items to inactive, then sets the 1 item to active. Animations are used the entire time,  and he's labeling the elements as active/not active using css classes
[09:50:51] <defaultro> got it
[09:51:12] <defaultro> need to find the html part of it
[09:51:36] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: thanks 4 all the help!
[09:51:45] <defaultro> I don't know what hasClass is. How can I get information about the functions he used?
[09:51:50] <Whirl3d_> codepython7771, what about this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/4cHSY/19/
[09:51:58] <Whirl3d_> You just didn't have the box shadow css added
[09:52:04] <defaultro> removeClass, I read it this morning from getting started with jquery
[09:52:14] <Stephen> As for the syntax, just keep http://api.jquery.com/browser/ open
[09:52:25] <Stephen> Easy way to look up any function
[09:52:27] <defaultro> k
[09:52:29] <defaultro> oh
[09:52:30] <Whirl3d_> and just to be clear, you are going to need to make your logo have a transparent background if you want the white to look right
[09:52:33] <Stephen> If it ain't there, then is custom
[09:52:39] <defaultro> checking the site
[09:52:59] <Stephen> documentation = your friend
[09:53:02] <defaultro> yup
[09:53:27] <defaultro> how come, there is an install now link?
[09:53:31] <codepython7771> Whirl3d_: still looks very different: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/4cHSY/19/show/ vs http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/2JRbe/20/show/
[09:54:01] <defaultro> :( failing to install on my laptop
[09:54:10] <Stephen> defaultro: You can get the API Reference as an Adobe AIR app
[09:54:17] <defaultro> k
[09:54:29] <Stephen> Here, use this instead
[09:54:29] <Stephen> http://api.jquery.com/
[09:54:37] <defaultro> is Adobe AIR the same as Adobe acrobat?
[09:54:40] <defaultro> k
[09:54:51] <Stephen> No, nevermind, don't use the adobe air version
[09:54:55] <defaultro> k
[09:55:01] <Stephen> http://api.jquery.com/ Is the HTML version

[09:56:58] <codepython7771> sunbeam: you can not - unless its public
[09:57:03] <codepython7771> even then its pain
[09:58:02] <sunbeam> codepython7771: the facebook page is public
[10:00:01] <codepython7771> sunbeam: then use python to get the data and use jquery/css/html to display it?
[10:00:42] <sunbeam> its a php site
[10:00:52] <sunbeam> there should be a facebook api
[10:02:35] <tw2113> have fun getting fb data out :D

[10:04:38] <defaultro> I am confused about console.log("Hamburgers".substring(3,10)). Why not 3,9 to get burgers

[10:09:02] <ntry> Hi there. I am looking for a jquery plugin that allows me to create sliders. Not Image-Slider, more like the jquery-ui slider, but i dont want to configure and load the big jquery ui for only one slider
[10:09:22] <ntry> when i google jquery and slider, i only find diashows
[10:09:46] <Whirl3d_> http://7.mshcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/wavelogo.png
[10:16:42] <barraponto> is there a timer plugin I can use to do something every X seconds?
[10:17:59] <shoky> barraponto: setTimeout/setInterval ?
[10:19:48] <barraponto> shoky: setTimeOut helps me do something once
[10:19:56] <shoky> barraponto: then call it again
[10:20:03] <ntry> setInterval
[10:20:19] <barraponto> setInterval, indeed. thanks shoky and ntry
[10:20:34] <barraponto> is there a caveat?
[10:21:02] <ntry> no, works fine
[10:21:25] <ntry> clearInterval helps to kill it again, if you want so
[10:22:51] <ntry> Does anyone know a lighter slider plugin, than the jquery-UI Slider?
[10:23:31] <barraponto> ntry: I don't think roundabout is lighter, but I liked that it loops.
[10:24:15] <shoky> they are totally different types of "sliders"
[10:24:28] <shoky> i think
[10:24:57] <ntry> i mean this http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[10:26:27] <ntry> but i dont want to install the big jquery ui
[10:27:35] <shoky> ntry you don't need the full library
[10:27:50] <shoky> just core/widget/mouse/slider
[10:28:26] <ntry> well yes, that sound like alot for only one slider
[10:29:47] <ntry> any idea for another plugin or what i could google instead of "slider" ?
[10:32:11] <shoky> found this.. http://refreshless.com/nouislider/
[10:34:16] <barraponto> ntry: I guess there was some kind input widget for that in HTML5
[10:35:25] <barraponto> ntry: if there is you can check for support with modernizr and avoid loading the jqui+mouse+slider
[10:37:30] <ntry> hm i will google that, thank you
[10:37:33] <ntry> and thanks shoky
[10:42:30] <ajustrun> hey guys, if i have an if statement inside doc ready, does that only test it once when the page loads?
[10:42:34] <ajustrun> or does it test it continously
[10:42:52] <ajustrun> is that a stupid question?
[10:45:13] <abuayyoub> Hello, I was wondering if someone would be willing to help me. I am trying to install a wordpress plugin that I bought that uses Jqurey and it's not working i was wondering if anyone would be able to help me out a little. here is the website www.boukay.com/stream-3 and this is what its supposed to look like... www.http://bit.ly/N6n4Ju
[10:47:39] <ThrushAAX> abuayyoub: your include for jquery is wrong
[10:48:16] <dardevelin> hi everyone
[10:48:18] <abuayyoub> ThrushAAX: really? I see that it is calling information from my website, that should be twitter, facebook, pinterest feeds
[10:48:24] <abuayyoub> Hello dardevelin
[10:48:34] <dardevelin> abuayyoub, :)
[10:48:48] <abuayyoub> ThrushAAX:  how can i fix it? can you help me? I haven
[10:48:56] <abuayyoub> havent spept stressing over this
[10:48:57] <ThrushAAX> actually, that's not it
[10:49:14] <ThrushAAX> though you have a weird line of src="http://www.jqueryc.com/jquery.js
[10:50:37] <abuayyoub> ThrushAAX:  sad to say im completely clueless about Jquery/Javascript I just started learning CSS and HTML a few weeks ago.
[10:51:15] <abuayyoub> ThrushAAX: what do you suggest? The company I bought this from wants to charge me to fix it. I think they sold it to me broken lol
[10:52:03] <tash> for some reason my dialog closes immediately after opening
[10:52:23] <ThrushAAX> it looks like the infinite scroll thing is causing an error
[10:52:27] <ThrushAAX> try removing that plugin
[10:53:21] <abuayyoub> ThrushAAX:  I think thats a pivotal part of my template. www.boukay.com you can see how it  is just one giant page of content.
[10:53:58] <ThrushAAX> infinite scroll is for multiple pages of content... and then instead of having to click to the next page it just loads it at the bottom of the current page
[10:55:16] <abuayyoub> ThrushAAX:  yea, thats how the main part of the website works. I add content and it just stacks ontop of the older content. you just scroll forever instead of having multiple pages. if I removed that I think it will break my entire website.
[10:56:06] <Misiur> Hi. Let's say I have two .on hooked on one element. How can I cancel the second one from the first one? ( http://jsfiddle.net/V9tMK/ - I don't want the second text appended)
[10:56:50] <Misiur> *not with off
[10:56:56] <ThrushAAX> abuayyoub: ugh, I just dug into infinitescroll, that's not causing any problems I think
[10:57:08] <ThrushAAX> its actually not running at all... just showing a debug line
[10:57:11] <abuayyoub> ThrushAAX: do you think its just incompatible with my current theme?
[10:57:11] <abuayyoub> oh ok
[10:57:17] <ThrushAAX> what exactly is the issues you are having though?
[10:58:56] <abuayyoub> ThrushAAX:  Well, it should look like this.. http://bit.ly/N6n4Ju and this is what it looks like on my website. http://boukay.com/stream-3/ Also, the content is wrong. That content there is supposed to be a twitter, facebook and pinterest feed, instead its content from my website, tags, links etc. Its pretty strange
[10:59:20] <abuayyoub> This is why I thought that my main template and the plugin were both trying to call the same Jquery file
[10:59:28] <barraponto> how do I check if my function got an expected optional argument?
[10:59:40] <ThrushAAX> looks like a themeing and configuration problem then
[10:59:50] <abuayyoub> because for some reason its taking my content and putting it into the plugin
[10:59:59] <Misiur> barraponto: You can check the magic arguments variable
[11:01:08] <ajustrun> hey guys, does using .scroll slow down the page at all?
[11:01:18] <abuayyoub> ThrushAAX:  what do you suggest? I really like this plugin as you can see it will fit well with my template design the whole grid thing. I've been looking around and I cant find anything similar.
[11:01:36] <ThrushAAX> abuayyoub: um, actually, I don't see where you are even running and loading the dcSocialStream
[11:01:51] <ThrushAAX> <meta property="og:description" content="jQuery(document) ...
[11:01:58] <ThrushAAX> that doesn't look right
[11:02:25] <abuayyoub> ThrushAAX: you think I should jsut delete the plugin and try to re-up it?
[11:02:32] <ThrushAAX> probably
[11:02:36] <ThrushAAX> looks like its completely wrong
[11:02:38] <abuayyoub> ok ill try that now.
[11:03:00] <ThrushAAX> also, you might have to manually do things to your theme to make it work
[11:03:14] <barraponto> Misiur: how?
[11:05:10] <Misiur> barraponto: http://jsfiddle.net/GTnLQ/
[11:05:40] <Misiur> oh wait
[11:05:44] <Misiur> optional argument
[11:06:39] <Misiur> barraponto: http://jsfiddle.net/GTnLQ/1/
[11:06:54] <quantegy> anyone got a good resource online for learning how to stylistically customize JQ mobile?
[11:08:46] <barraponto> Misiur: thanks a lot!
[11:09:07] <Misiur> np
[11:11:07] <ajustrun> hey guys, is there a way to put a delay in before centerImages here? http://pastie.org/4256591
[11:11:35] <tash> can someone tell me why my dialog ( http://pastebin.com/fKeTYhG1 ) closes immediately when I click on my button that launches it? ( http://pastebin.com/SbhVALip )
[11:11:47] <tash> it opens for a sec, then closes right away
[11:12:56] <Misiur> ajustrun: setTimeout('centerImages', 500)
[11:13:47] <ajustrun> thanks Misiur!
[11:14:26] <ajustrun> why doesnt it need to be centerImages()
[11:14:28] <ajustrun> ?
[11:15:27] <ajustrun> Misiur: that isnt calling centerImages()
[11:15:49] <ajustrun> ah it did need the () :-D
[11:16:22] <Misiur> ajustrun: My fault, use setTimeout(Foo,Â 1000);
[11:16:29] <Misiur> without quotes it doesn't call eval internally
[11:16:48] <ajustrun> oh i see
[11:16:51] <Misiur> if you need parameters setTimeout(function() { centerImages(something); }, 500);
[11:20:32] <sunbeam> hi, does anyone know how I can get all wall posts from a certain facebook page (page can be viewed without logging in) with a certain ID?
[11:22:54] <Misiur> sunbeam: Graph api
[11:25:33] <sunbeam> Misiur: you ever used this?
[11:25:36] <sunbeam> I cannot find good documents about it
[11:26:58] <Misiur> sunbeam: using this api https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/
[11:27:02] <Misiur> s/api/sdk
[11:27:24] <Misiur> Facebook is clearly pain in the ass when it comes to apis
[11:28:16] <tash> I didn't include my html before. Here is my whole file.  my form at the bottom is what I'm opening with the dialog.  I can't figure out why it opens then automatically closes when I click on the "open-dialog" button ... I need it to stay open http://pastebin.com/8Am6uJ8m
[11:30:09] <sunbeam> Misiur: if i only have an id, and the facebook page is public, its enough?
[11:30:10] <quantegy> ugh FB SDK = 'awful mess';
[11:30:16] <quantegy> too much control
[11:31:19] <Misiur> tash: 1. You are missing at least one </td>
[11:31:30] <quantegy> there's nothing like throwing off the design of a site by throwing big blue FB iframe in there
[11:32:05] <Misiur> sunbeam: I did not track recent changes in their access tokens, you must check dev center
[11:32:24] <quantegy> and I know of no way to just plop a customized stream in there without having to login yourself in each time
[11:32:37] <abuayyoub> member:ThrushAAX: well, I uninstalled it, I also uninstalled a bunch of other plugins and pages that I had cluttering my space up.  that seemed to help a little, it's still not working but it seems to be on the right track.
[11:33:08] <abuayyoub> ThrushAAX: well, I uninstalled it, I also uninstalled a bunch of other plugins and pages that I had cluttering my space up.  that seemed to help a little, it's still not working but it seems to be on the right track.
[11:33:18] <abuayyoub> www.boukay.com/stream
[11:33:41] <abuayyoub> This is the "stream" not the wall, I assume they will both work when I figure out what the problem is.
[11:34:02] <Misiur> tash: You must add event.preventDefault + event.stopPropagation on the all buttons
[11:35:16] <tw2113> abuayyoub i still wanna know how this is happening with your site: </head></div><body class="page page-id-938 page-template-default">
[11:35:42] <abuayyoub> tw2113: hey there man how you doin?
[11:35:53] <abuayyoub> tw2113: It's still doing it?
[11:36:07] <tw2113> yup
[11:36:17] <abuayyoub> tw2113: what does it mean?
[11:36:34] <tash> Misiur: ok
[11:37:14] <tw2113> something's messed up and putting <div> tags outside of the body, and firebug is showing style/script/meta tags inside the body tag as well
[11:37:15] <abuayyoub> tw2113: I deleted the plugin and re-uploaded it I also deleted alot of extra pages and disabled plugins. It seems to be ALMOST working now
[11:37:23] <tash> Misiur: are you talking about the buttons in the itemDialog?
[11:37:29] <tash> Add and Ok
[11:37:51] <tash> ore remove and edit
[11:37:53] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  is it someting I can just delete?
[11:38:07] <tw2113> dunno, i can't see your header.php file
[11:39:18] <Misiur> tash: #open-dialog to be exact, but others too if you don't want to submit form on click
[11:39:49] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  http://pastebin.com/yYRq23dD <~ Header.php
[11:40:06] <Misiur> I might be missing something, so it'd be best if you use jsfiddle with whole code
[11:41:55] <tw2113> very odd, not sure what's causing that still
[11:42:00] <abuayyoub> damn
[11:42:07] <tw2113> at least parts of it
[11:42:13] <tw2113> line 24-26 is obvious
[11:42:34] <abuayyoub> should I delete it?
[11:42:43] <tw2113> that stray closing div tag? yes
[11:42:48] <tw2113> it's doing nothing for you
[11:43:23] <abuayyoub> You know thats not the first time its happend having a stray <div> tag
[11:43:24] <tash> Misiur: thanks
[11:43:26] <abuayyoub> deleted
[11:43:43] <abuayyoub> there was another instance where it was messing up the alignment of my entire website
[11:43:46] <abuayyoub> a stray tag
[11:45:12] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  Well, I deleted lines 24-26 but it didnt seem to make any difference to the page.
[11:46:19] <tw2113> i hope you just deleted the div tag and left the </head> and <body> tag intact
[11:46:39] <tw2113> also you must be cached or something, i can't get that part cleared
[11:46:46] <tw2113> next question is why is all this below the body tag http://pastebin.com/cq99cW3V
[11:46:50] <Misiur> abuayyoub: Can you upload somewhere parsed HTML ?
[11:47:13] <Misiur> or is it http://boukay.com/stream/
[11:47:14] <Misiur> ?
[11:47:29] <abuayyoub> Misiur: I'm not sure what that is exactly.
[11:47:57] <fdv> I've got this issue with clicked() not being triggered if changed() adds to the DOM if both should be triggered by a button click. Can anybody see why? http://jsfiddle.net/eUJuf/4/
[11:48:33] <abuayyoub> tw2113: dark.css is a color scheme for my theme.
[11:48:41] <Misiur> let me read whole story
[11:48:44] <tw2113> i'm not worried about what it is
[11:48:49] <tw2113> i'm worried why it's put where it's put
[11:49:56] <abuayyoub> tw2113: i honestly have no idea why it's there.
[11:50:50] <tw2113> neither do i, which is puzzling
[11:51:38] <Misiur> fdv: http://jsfiddle.net/eUJuf/5/ - if you run change only on text field it runs
[11:54:00] <Misiur> fdv: http://jsfiddle.net/eUJuf/7/ alternative version without adding id to input
[11:54:04] <fdv> Misiur: yes, it seems to do so, but not in chrome. Thanks, though
[11:54:38] <Misiur> I'm running it in chrome :o
[11:54:43] <fdv> hm
[11:54:49] <fdv> windows?
[11:54:50] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  this friggin plugin is gonna be the death of me.  I don't suppose you know of something similar, so I can ditch this and move on?
[11:55:00] <Misiur> win 7 x64
[11:55:17] <fdv> ok, I'll check my virtual win instance
[11:55:45] <tw2113> isn't this the 2nd time you'd try that?
[11:57:46] <fdv> Misiur: weird, I only get the changed event if the checkbox is checked, also chrome on win7/64bit
[11:58:06] <abuayyoub> tw2113: well i didnt give up on it yet because I cant find anything similar
[12:00:16] <tw2113> i have to wonder if things would start working a bit more once you get your end result markup in order
[12:00:24] <Misiur> fdv: As in it appends 'changed' text, or as in shows blue box?
[12:01:52] <fdv> Misiur: I need the click() event to also be triggered, which one might assume when clicking on the button
[12:02:34] <abuayyoub> tw2113: what do you mean "end result markup"?
[12:02:45] <fdv> Misiur: when the blue box is *not* shown, the changed event is triggered, followed by the click event
[12:03:04] <tw2113> what you see when you hit view-source
[12:03:20] <fdv> Misiur: when the blu box is added, only the changed event is triggered, not the click event
[12:03:43] <fdv> that seems rather odd to me, but I guess there's a reason
[12:04:05] <fdv> the QA guys certainly didn't like it :p
[12:04:13] <abuayyoub> tw2113: is there something wonrg with it?
[12:04:14] <tw2113> abuayyoub http://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fboukay.com%2Fstream%2F
[12:04:17] <tw2113> yes
[12:04:31] <tw2113> you have meta tags and style tags and link tags inside the body tag when they should be inside the head tag
[12:06:09] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  26 errors, damn
[12:06:27] <tw2113> view-source shows them correctly it seems
[12:06:31] <tw2113> firebug shows them wrong
[12:06:47] <tw2113> i still see that stray div tag so something is hardcore cached on my end
[12:07:18] <abuayyoub> really? I deleted it...
[12:07:22] <tw2113> i know you said you did
[12:07:27] <tw2113> see: cached
[12:07:40] <tw2113> do you have any caching plugins goin on?
[12:07:51] <abuayyoub> ah, I do yes.
[12:07:55] <Misiur> fdv: Indeed quite interesting case. Let me run some more tests
[12:08:42] <fdv> Misiur: thanks, appreciate that
[12:08:59] <abuayyoub> tw2113: WP Super Cache  - Very fast caching plugin for WordPress. Want me to disable it?
[12:09:11] <tw2113> just dump your cache if anything
[12:09:17] <tw2113> i've heard of it
[12:09:22] * tw2113 does a lot of WP
[12:10:18] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  ok, it should be emptied.
[12:10:58] <tw2113> yay! only 25 errors now
[12:11:03] <abuayyoub> hahaha
[12:11:08] <abuayyoub> well thats a relief
[12:11:31] <abuayyoub> this is just for the "stream" page or for the entire website?
[12:12:11] <tw2113> so far, just the stream page
[12:12:15] <tw2113> i'll let you check the rest
[12:12:19] <abuayyoub> lol ok
[12:12:30] <tw2113> ReferenceError: zintro is not defined <----------firebug error related to social stream or whatever
[12:12:33] <Misiur> fdv: This is some kind of sorcery. If you switch before to after it works
[12:12:46] <Misiur> http://jsfiddle.net/eUJuf/9/
[12:13:14] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  yea, I have no idea what the hell that is. Google dosent even know what it is.
[12:13:29] <Misiur> It's either a) webkit bug b) jQuery bug c) intended behavior, but I don't know where to looks for documentation
[12:13:30] <tw2113> talk to the plugin authors
[12:13:55] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  I did they want to charge me 150 bucks an hour
[12:14:13] <tw2113> then i'd dump this right away, personally
[12:14:13] <abuayyoub> 12 dollars for the plugin 150 bucks an hour to fix it because they sold it to me broken
[12:14:16] <abuayyoub> lol
[12:14:44] <abuayyoub> yea,  i just wish I could find another like it
[12:15:05] <abuayyoub> it would work very nicely with my website I think
[12:15:12] <abuayyoub> because of the whole grid motief
[12:15:13] <abuayyoub> lol
[12:15:16] <tw2113> i'm not even sure what it does
[12:15:41] <abuayyoub> basically, it takes all your social network streams and turns it into a grid wall.
[12:16:01] <abuayyoub> tw2113: http://bit.ly/N6n4Ju
[12:16:09] <abuayyoub> thats what it looks like, or is supposed to look like
[12:16:35] <tw2113> eh, that out of order markup in firebug is going to bother me until it's gone
[12:16:42] <fdv> Misiur: the plot thickens.. :)
[12:16:45] <tw2113> and i have to wonder if parts of this are defined in that
[12:16:51] <tw2113> and thus everything gets fucked up because of order
[12:17:22] <Misiur> fdv: I'll try with not minified jQuery version
[12:17:39] <Misiur> tw2113: Do you have uncompressed version of this jquery.social.stream.js?
[12:17:47] <tw2113> nope
[12:18:23] <tw2113> what's jquery?
[12:19:30] <Misiur> my mind is full of walking dinosaurs right now
[12:19:36] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  Login: Mike Password : MikeRocksIt ( Mike is the guy who wants to charge me 150 bucks an hour to fix it, I made a login for him. )
[12:20:02] <abuayyoub> dont know if that will help at all
[12:21:05] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  Ever been to Egypt? If you somehow manage to fix this for me ill write your name and all hails to you on the great Pyramid of Giza when I go next week. lol
[12:38:34] <Misiur> fdv: Ok, so after running profiler some conclusions. 1) when you run only click event it simply runs. 2) when you run changed event and click the click event is called indirectly 3) when you run changed, then you run before which changes DOM structure and then you run click event - the click event is somehow removed from the stack
[12:38:48] <Misiur> why and how - I don't have time for this today
[12:39:38] <Misiur> anyway hotfix is creating the div in html and later just showing it
[12:40:15] <Misiur> Looks like but in jQuery indirect event stacking.
[12:40:26] <fdv> Misiur: so it seems to be a jquery issue, then
[12:40:36] <fdv> thanks a lot for checking it out
[12:41:00] <fdv> guess I'll have to resort to hidden divs, then
[12:53:05] <fdv> Misiur: actually, hidden divs doesn't seem to help: http://jsfiddle.net/eUJuf/11/
[12:53:26] <fdv> (fyi, in case you look more into it later)
[12:54:24] <Misiur> This is magical, and this might be webkit bug, not jq. It's like it need the clicked element to stay in the same position to trigger the event
[12:55:45] <alexidoia> hi
[12:57:52] <alexidoia> I'd like to use $('#mydiv').css('min-height',$('myimg').height()+'px') to set the div at the height of my image, that work good, but not the first time I load the page, I think this might be due to the fact that the script is executed before the img has the time to load (quite big img), how can I delay my script ?
[13:00:14] <fdv> Misiur: is the event stack available in the callbacks?
[13:00:49] <fdv> Misiur: same thing in firefox as well, so I don't think webkit alone is to blame
[13:07:12] <shoky> alexidoia: $('img#myimg').load( function() { $('#mydiv').css('min-height', $(this).height()+'px') });
[13:07:30] <alexidoia> that simple, thanks !
[13:09:09] <shoky> alexidoia: but it's better if you know the height in advance..
[13:09:32] <alexidoia> yeah...
[13:11:17] <shoky> wait, you ran your stuff in DOM ready handler, yea?
[13:11:43] <shoky> if not, that'd be the first thing to try ;P
[14:12:50] <Whirl3d> shoky! Whats up?
[14:29:33] <dispy> Hi
[14:29:57] <csantovsky> hallo
[14:30:10] <dispy> how can I pass additional data to the UI::AutoComplete request? I could of course overwrite the handler and write an entirely new request, but I actually only need to pass some (static) additional data
[14:33:26] <csantovsky> there are the label and value fields
[14:33:57] <csantovsky> you could make the value an object with all the required data: value={field1: 'one', field2: 'two',...}
[14:35:47] <dispy> I mean in the request to the server, not the answer
[14:35:57] <dispy> googling brought up only an extra handler
[14:37:43] <csantovsky> dispy: are you talking about how the source method talks to the server? I'm not sure this is inside of the scope of the autocomplete plugin
[14:38:38] <dispy> @csantovsky: the plugin just appends ?term=bla t0 the source. I'd be enought to add &param=blubb for me
[14:38:59] <dispy> or does it automatically discover source?firstparam=[...] and uses & instead?
[14:40:19] <abletony84> I'm trying to get one of those neat "Attach a file" thingies that Gmail has: http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/uPuY4/ - but what do I have to do next?
[14:40:37] <csantovsky> you could try, but as I've never used this plugin this way I cannot tell you if that would work
[14:41:07] <dispy> k thanks
[14:43:54] <fdv> Misiur: I think I have it now, it seems rather mundane. afaics, what happens is that the browser registers a mouse down event, and given that the focus is in the input field, it triggers the change event on the form. Now, the change event modifies the document, and actually moves the button down a few pixels. after the change event, I guess the browser starts looking at where the click was made, and, lo and behold, there's no button in that position ...
[14:44:00] <fdv> ... (anymore). That's why .after() works, and it also works if the button is made sufficiently high that and one clicks sufficiently low on it to ensure that the click will hit the button in its new position
[14:45:04] <fdv> Misiur: (see http://jsfiddle.net/eUJuf/12/)
[14:45:09] <TomvB> I'm having trouble with accessing data from a json array. How would I go about getting the value from the first 'loop_id' when I use .getJSON to import this data: {"1":{"loop_id":"217","filename":"WIN WIN - Not Too Late.swf","gif":"tumblr_lmwen16d2C1qgbvzco1_500.gif","bg":"square_bg.png"},"2":{"loop_id".... etc
[14:45:14] <TomvB> I guess I'm thinking too much in php terms or something
[14:46:16] <fdv> obj["1"]?
[14:46:46] <bwq> object.1.loop_id
[14:47:17] <TomvB> that's what I was thinking yeah, but it's giving me a 'undefined' error
[14:47:28] <dabear_> obj["1"].loop_id
[14:47:31] <fdv> wow, can you actually use integers as variables?
[14:47:38] <dabear_> fdv: nope
[14:47:46] <fdv> that seems rather, hard for the parsers, yes
[14:47:56] <TomvB> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'loop_id' of undefined
[14:48:12] <TomvB> waaaaaaaaaait
[14:48:37] <TomvB> oops, was using ["0"], but there is no 0 :)
[14:48:43] <TomvB> that worked, thanks guys :)
[14:48:52] <TomvB> data["1"].loop_id that is
[14:48:55] <bwq> yeah sorry
[14:49:05] <bwq> it's var['1'].loop_id
[14:49:10] <bwq> yup
[14:49:32] <bwq> it's better to just put those in an array though :)
[14:49:41] <bwq> like, have result : [
[14:49:42] <Misiur> fdv: So looks like click event is handled by coordinates or something. Good to know
[14:49:44] <bwq> in front of it
[14:49:51] <bwq> then you can use var.results etc.
[14:50:07] <fdv> Misiur: well, it took enough hours of my limited time in this place ;)
[14:50:15] <fdv> Misiur: thanks again for helping out
[14:50:42] <Misiur> It's almost always some little quirk which consume lots and lots of hours.
[14:50:51] <fdv> indeed
[14:51:16] <Misiur> Do you plan on reporting bug to jquery?
[14:51:29] <fdv> well, it's not really a jquery bug, is it?
[14:51:56] <fdv> it'd be nice if it was possible to ensure that the click event is handled first
[14:52:15] <fdv> but that's not easily possible as it stands today, is it?
[14:52:45] <TomvB> bwq, I was searching for a way of doing that, but I couldn't really find good info
[14:53:04] <Misiur> Fx uses spidermonkey js engine, chrome uses webkit - it's either their shared bug, or it's jquery lib handling bug. I don't know anything about setting events order, sorry
[14:53:10] <TomvB> first time working with arrays in jquery
[14:54:06] <fdv> TomvB: well, you're not, are you? :)
[14:54:21] <fdv> (working with arrays, that is)
[14:54:29] <TomvB> good point :)
[14:54:32] <Misiur> js> var a = [{"loop_id":"217"},{"loop_id":"218"}]; return a[0].loop_id;
[14:54:41] <Misiur> oh, it doesn't work in #jquery
[14:55:17] <fdv> Misiur: so you'd consider it a bug?
[14:55:17] <dispy> @csantovsky: he recognises that. nice ^
[14:55:41] <dabear_> ?jseval var a = [{"loop_id":"217"},{"loop_id":"218"}]; return a[0].loop_id
[14:55:47] <bot-t> dabear_: SyntaxError: return not in function
[14:55:55] <dabear_> ?jseval var a = [{"loop_id":"217"},{"loop_id":"218"}];  a[0].loop_id
[14:55:57] <bot-t> dabear_: "217"
[14:55:59] <csantovsky> great! thanks for sharing this info, dispy
[14:56:19] <Misiur> dabear_: Good to know about this
[14:56:34] <Misiur> fdv: I think it's a bug, but don't know which piece of software
[14:57:12] <Misiur> I'll try with JS without libraries tommorow
[14:59:35] <fdv> Misiur: it'd be interesting to hear how that turns out :)
[15:00:44] <bwq> TomvB: use an associative array
[15:01:16] <bwq> what i do is return an associative array that looks like this: result['results'] = results_array
[15:01:18] <bwq> then i jsonify that
[15:01:32] <bwq> and i get all my results in a "results" wrapper
[15:01:34] <TomvB> hm, ok, I guess I have to build that within a $.getJSON('/json',function(data){ $.getJSON('/json',function(data){ construct?
[15:01:45] <TomvB> or is there a simple way of converthing/saving it?
[15:02:02] <bwq> no
[15:02:06] <bwq> you do that on the server-side
[15:02:13] <bwq> since it's the json you return to the browser
[15:02:46] <bwq> that way i can just use it like this:
[15:02:52] <bwq> data.results[0].link
[15:02:53] <bwq> etc.
[15:03:24] <bwq> it's not that different from your json, but i like having that parent element there
[15:03:46] <TomvB> http://next.loopbox.net/json
[15:04:02] <TomvB> thats the array i'm using and the json it produces
[15:04:21] <bwq> yup
[15:04:46] <TomvB> is that a correct way of using it?
[15:05:59] <bwq> sure, it's not a bad way by all means
[15:06:10] <TomvB> k, nice
[15:06:11] <bwq> but i just prefer having a root element
[15:06:17] <TomvB> ah, ok
[15:06:21] <bwq> so it would look like this
[15:06:39] <bwq> {"results" : ["1":{"loop_id":"217","filename":"WIN WIN - Not Too Late.swf","gif":"tumblr_lmwen16d2C1qgbvzco1_500.gif","bg":"square_bg.png"},"2":{"loop_id":"221","filename":"Niki and The Dove - Gentle Roar (Mylo Remix).swf","gif":"tumblr_m2sa58N0j31qzw1qyo1_500.gif","bg":"0f5ee0e85c85e606128954f4b817647b.png"}, ...}
[15:07:50] <Whirl3d> not sure if quotes are requiredfor the attribute names
[15:08:22] <bwq> double quotes are required yes
[15:08:25] <bwq> for proper json
[15:08:45] <TomvB> thats just php json_encode() output
[15:09:07] <TomvB> data[1].loop_id does work though
[15:09:12] <TomvB> data.1.loop_id doesnt
[15:09:13] <Whirl3d> Weird, my server returns an object that doesn't have the quotes around the attribute names, just the values
[15:09:31] <bwq> TomvB: http://pastebin.com/j5hwU4MM
[15:09:35] <bwq> yeah, the .1 was a typo of mine
[15:09:41] <bwq> since i'm used to using data.results :)
[15:09:41] <dabear_> Whirl3d: that would break json parsers :)
[15:09:56] <bwq> indeed, it would
[15:10:41] <TomvB> ok, so right now I got var data within that .getJSON function. How would I go about saving that into a array I can use to get data from it later on?
[15:11:03] <bwq> it's already an array
[15:11:06] <bwq> var data;
[15:11:10] <bwq> data = data;
[15:11:26] <bwq> var data somewhere outside the function, where other functions have access to it
[15:11:29] <bwq> preferably with a better name :p
[15:11:30] <TomvB> Ah good, I was getting confused :)
[15:11:37] <bwq> then when the ajax is finished, you update it
[15:11:55] <bwq> var loopResults = data;
[15:11:57] <bwq> like that
[15:12:17] <bwq> and then it's just loopResults['1'] etc.
[15:12:27] <fdv> Misiur: I do sort of feel that it makes sense that the fact that focus is lost from the input field is handled before one looks at where the focus should be next
[15:13:09] <TomvB> http://pastebin.com/g1bLVQCM
[15:13:13] <TomvB> this doesnt seem to work
[15:13:30] <bwq> what does it log?
[15:13:32] <Whirl3d> according to json.org, the use of quotes appears to be optional unless enclosing a string...still checking though
[15:13:47] <TomvB> Uncaught ReferenceError: loopResults is not defined
[15:14:00] <bwq> yes
[15:14:06] <bwq> define the var loopResults outside the functino
[15:14:08] <bwq> function*
[15:14:23] <bwq> and then within the function, you just use "loopResults = loops;"
[15:14:51] <bwq> Whirl3d: most parsers expect the double quotes
[15:15:08] <bwq> and proper json libs add them as well
[15:16:24] <TomvB> I don't think I understand
[15:17:52] <mpwd> Anybody have a good reference for manipulating external SVGs in <object> tags?
[15:18:41] <mpwd> I'm trying to dynamically attach a <link> to a CSS file to an external SVG but having no luck
[15:18:59] <mpwd> arm, *in an external...
[15:19:53] <Misiur> fdv: http://jsfiddle.net/9B8PE/ - not too nice code, but well. The blur is happening before click event, and the result is the same.
[15:20:31] <bwq> TomvB: you see your $.getJSON function, right?
[15:20:38] <TomvB> yeah
[15:20:42] <bwq> place "var loopResults;" right above that
[15:20:54] <bwq> then within the $.getJSON function, you add
[15:20:58] <bwq> "loopResults = loops;"
[15:22:08] <TomvB> that's what I was trying, but it still gives me an undifined error when I try to console.log(LoopResults)
[15:22:17] <TomvB> isnt that because the getJSON call is asynchronous?
[15:22:41] <bwq> nope
[15:22:51] <bwq> what's your full code?
[15:22:52] <TomvB> weird
[15:23:00] <bwq> why do you use LoopResults?
[15:23:05] <bwq> thought you called it loopResults :p
[15:23:31] <TomvB> http://pastebin.com/2mTvZsCi
[15:24:06] <bwq> what's the error?
[15:24:21] <TomvB> undefined
[15:24:35] <bwq> try to log it within the function
[15:24:41] <bwq> you're right about the async
[15:24:45] <bwq> that's probably it
[15:25:16] <TomvB> I'm thinking about thist putting my main function within that $.getJSON thing
[15:25:19] <TomvB> *just
[15:25:40] <fdv> Misiur: nice one.
[15:25:41] <bwq> you're supposed to call it within there yeah
[15:25:50] <bwq> don't have to put the entire function in there though
[15:25:57] <bwq> just call it and pass it the callback data
[15:30:52] <Misiur> fdv: I think you explained it right - it's expected behaviour due to events priority (blur (input) -> change -> focus (button, which have moved) -> click)
[15:35:14] <fdv> Misiur: I'm guessing as much. I have a seriously ugly hack to get around it that may very well have unforeseen implications.. I'm using a timer to postpone creating / showing the div, so that the mouse down event occurs over the button. Feels like I really need to wash my hands with bleach afterwards, though
[15:39:11] <Guddu> Could someone help me with my web screen? The page is http://ec2-23-21-191-23.compute-1.aem from dropdown.mazonaws.com/EMS/receiving/ To login please use admin/admin When you enter the page, type paco in the search box and select any it
[15:39:19] <Guddu> em from the dropdown.
[15:39:47] <Guddu> Now when i do a delete of this row, the JS code is not kicking in for some reason. Even though I have sepcified correct Selectors
[15:40:45] <Misiur> fdv: The click event is called only when the when the mouse is released and pointer is on button. Check this simple fix: http://jsfiddle.net/eUJuf/14/
[15:40:55] <fdv> Misiur: an interesting explanation from #webkit: click event, as currently spec'ed, requires that the element for which mousedown and moseup match.
[15:41:06] <fdv> Misiur: right
[15:41:40] <fdv> exactly
[15:41:59] <b0bi> Hi, I have a small problem with addClass() - http://pastebin.com/bcu5yh6W , I am adding a class to an anchor tag, and it seems to do nothing, console log is inside.
[15:42:33] <Misiur> Dammit, those painkillers are impairing me - I haven't thought of that solution even though it was so simple
[15:42:44] <fdv> Misiur: thanks again, I certainly learned something today :)
[15:42:58] <Misiur> Me too :D
[15:43:18] <b0bi> any help with my problem will be appreciated :)
[15:43:19] <Misiur> b0bi: How are you adding click handler to element?
[15:43:26] <Misiur> With .on .click .live or .delegate ?
[15:43:26] <fdv> Misiur: well, don't know what they're for, but I guess too much pain can be impairing, too :)
[15:43:29] <b0bi> .delegate
[15:44:53] <b0bi> the full function is here: http://pastebin.com/AHQdkWjn
[15:45:36] <Misiur> b0bi: use $(e.target) instead of $(this)
[15:45:41] <Misiur> it shall point to a
[15:46:58] <b0bi> doesn't work :(
[15:47:02] <b0bi> still same console output
[15:47:24] <b0bi> it looks like the console is showing the right element, weird isn't it?
[15:47:28] <shoky> b0bi: how come you're adding the class and removing it right away?
[15:47:54] <b0bi> shoky: after the ajax call is completed, i remove the disabled state
[15:48:01] <shoky> that's not after it's completed
[15:48:09] <shoky> that's straight away
[15:48:22] <shoky> if you want it after it's completed, it needs to be in the callback
[15:48:43] <b0bi> shoot, you're right.
[15:48:45] <Misiur> Ah, I'm blind too. shoky is right
[15:49:18] <b0bi> and now it is working!, but still, the console output should be synced to its current state in the code, is it not?
[15:49:46] <shoky> it's up to the browser, really
[15:50:16] <dispy> If I have a selection and iterate over this selection, adding an event listener to each element, what's the "best practice" to add those event-handlers to elements I add later on?
[15:50:21] <Guddu> Could someone please guide?
[15:50:33] <b0bi> dispy: .delegate
[15:50:50] <b0bi> shoky: thanks for the help.
[15:52:27] <Misiur> Well, as of 1.7 use .on
[15:52:48] <Misiur> everything gets bubbled to document anyways
[15:53:54] <shoky> dispy: read about event delegation in the docs for .on()
[15:54:07] <dispy> yea, found it. Thanks guys
[15:58:59] <osada> hi, have an issue with storing data in DOM with .data call
[15:59:58] <osada> when i try to add a script tag to the html with $('#id).data() call id does not work, however if i try html5 style 'data-type' attributes it works
[16:00:13] <osada> any ideas as to why this is ?
[16:01:01] <Guddu> Could someone please guide?
[16:03:35] <Misiur> Guddu: Can't get on site. Could you cut out only problematic part and paste on jsfiddle?
[16:03:57] <Misiur> osada: Any errors in console? Jsfiddle please
[16:04:07] <Guddu> Thanks Misiur The Link is http://ec2-23-21-191-23.compute-1.amazonaws.com/EMS/receiving I just realised that paste was messed up.
[16:05:00] <Guddu> Misiur, Please use admin/admin to login
[16:05:50] <dispy> if a parameter in JS isn't given, it's "undefined" so I can compare it to undefined?
[16:06:08] <Misiur> dispy: typeof variable === 'undefined'
[16:07:04] <Misiur> Guddu: 1. javascript:void(0) is absolutely aweful
[16:07:27] <Misiur> in which js file the code resides?
[16:07:42] <Guddu> Misiur, I wrote that just to give it a href...SO that it becomes a link when i take mouse over it.
[16:08:43] <Misiur> ok, so change your line: "$('a.delete_item').on('click', function(event){" to "$('document').on('click', 'a.delete_item', function(event){"
[16:08:52] <Misiur> if you want to know why - read the api on .on
[16:09:02] <Misiur> err, my fault
[16:09:10] <Misiur> "$(document).on('click', 'a.delete_item', function(event){"
[16:09:15] <Misiur> no quotes around document
[16:09:20] <Guddu> Thanks Misiur Checking
[16:10:03] <dispy> http://pastebin.com/sFXqDp8S << does this look good ?
[16:10:18] <dispy> somehow, the event handler isn't called any more since I switched to on() :X
[16:10:44] <Misiur> dispy: Is the element added on runtime?
[16:11:09] <dispy> yes, but it already exists when I add the handler
[16:11:18] <Hackwar> hi folks, I'm using jQuery UI Dialog and when I'm opening a dialog box, it removes the selected text from the source and when I then close that dialog, I can't reopen it. How can I make the dialog to only copy the code and not move it?
[16:11:54] <Misiur> dispy: Hm, try with adding event to document anyway.
[16:11:55] <Guddu> Thanks Misiur It works fine now. Does that mean that I used a wrong Syntax? Could you please guide me to the documentation?
[16:12:10] <dispy> to... document?
[16:12:58] <Misiur> Guddu & dispy: http://api.jquery.com/on/ Guddu: Syntax was okay, but if element is added in the runtime, you must use live, or the second usage of .on
[16:13:04] <dispy> ohoh my fault sorry
[16:13:09] <Misiur> the delegated event part
[16:14:02] <Misiur> I had hard time switching through live => bind => delegate => on, so I understand your problems
[16:14:16] <Misiur> I hope this won't change anytime soon
[16:14:50] <dispy> Misiur: no, it works fine this way. Why would I have to use the second usage?
[16:15:53] <Misiur> By second usage I meant assigning to document (sorry if you can't understand everything I say, but I'm drugged and english isn't my primary language)
[16:15:57] <Guddu> Misiur, Thanks. U r awesome. This was exactly my problem. i am not getting to understand JQuery better
[16:16:39] <Misiur> Guddu: Don't worry, you are welcome here and if I'll be around I can help
[16:16:48] <Guddu> * Not Getting = *NOW getting
[16:17:04] <dispy> hm yes that's clear. I can only query on DOM if the element has already been assigned. Thanks for this caveat anyway
[16:17:48] <Guddu> I am now changing remainder of my code to use document element to access dynamically added elements. :)
[16:19:04] <Misiur> The api explains it quite nice (and I recommend reading through it). Basically if you wait for event on document element, it'll be always present
[16:19:22] <Misiur> you simply compare the source of event to second parameter
[16:21:13] <ordinaryman09> anybody use jqmobi ?
[16:21:57] <Guddu> Is there a way to handle the TAB Key such that pressing tab always takes the control on a particular Input Field? :)
[16:22:39] <Misiur> Guddu: Check out html attribute called tabindex
[16:22:50] <Guddu> Thanks Misiur
[16:27:48] <dispy> hm data() does not work properly for me, whereas attr() does :X
[16:29:26] <Misiur> dispy: http://jsfiddle.net/X7MZX/
[16:30:50] <dispy> Misiur: http://jsfiddle.net/RupXj/ << as you can see, both attributes change simultaneously
[16:31:01] <dispy> as firebug shows, they don#t behave as they're supposed to do
[16:31:38] <dispy> if I replace the data() with an attr-call (prefixing "data-", it works fine
[16:32:17] <dispy> is it the case that jquery does not necessarily store the information in the HTMl-attributes themselves?
[16:33:11] <Misiur> http://jsfiddle.net/RupXj/1/ try that, if doesn't work provide me with html and those variables too
[16:42:58] <alexidoia> I use $('img.directors').load(function()) to be able to get the height of my image, but there is more than one image with it be triggered when all images are loaded ?
[16:44:21] <Misiur> alexidoia: Nope, it'll trigger on each one separately
[16:44:32] <alexidoia> ah cool thanks
[16:44:56] <Misiur> $(window).load on the other hand is triggered only once
[16:51:09] <Jesdisciple> Does anyone know of a plugin for mathematical operations on colors? For example, I would expect #FFFFFF - #CCFF33 = ##3300CC
[16:52:21] <Misiur> Jesdisciple: If you know how hex numbers work it isn't hard to do it
[16:52:47] <Jesdisciple> I know RGB but would certainly prefer a library >.>
[16:53:13] <Foxhoundz> You memorized all thre 0-255 color combinations?
[16:53:13] <Misiur> Jesdisciple: do you know that you have always 6 char hex?
[16:53:24] <Foxhoundz> three*
[16:53:50] <Jesdisciple> Mishur, yes, and that 3 chars expands to siz
[16:53:55] <Jesdisciple> six*
[16:54:16] <Jesdisciple> Fox, three? there are a lot more than three...
[16:54:45] <teear> hello
[16:54:52] <Jesdisciple> hiya
[16:55:59] <teear> hiyoho
[16:56:27] <iheartjs> Jesdisciple: should be pretty simple with parseInt(num, 16) and .toString(16)
[16:56:55] <iheartjs> Jesdisciple: just have to take care of adding/removing the initial "#"
[16:58:02] <Jesdisciple> alright, thanks... if it gets as long as I expect I'll try to save someone else the trouble afterward
[16:59:06] <teear> Hello, i'm from germany
[16:59:38] <teear> I'd like a little help with my code, i do not speak so good englisch but have a problem with my code
[17:00:04] <teear> There's a nipple in my code and it will nÃ¶t compile
[17:00:49] <wwwsevolod> hard man nipple?
[17:00:53] <teear> Glad you're all on the same page, I thought that I would have gone insane, but I just need a new nipple
[17:01:41] <teear> Here in Deutschland we call it nÃ¤nni
[17:02:48] <dispy> jquery stores it's data()-values in $.cache instead of the regular elements
[17:02:48] <dispy>  so I can't use the attr-selectors [] in the regular jquery selectors ;Ds
[17:03:27] <teear> Compile it without the nipple
[17:08:11] <Misiur> Jesdisciple: http://jsfiddle.net/6GxUt/ I can't sleep
[17:08:19] <Misiur> don't know how about negative numbers
[17:08:27] <Jesdisciple> heh, thanks
[17:09:11] <Misiur> feel free to extend it and upload to github
[17:30:12] <tw2113> abuayyoub i see you got it working a bit
[17:31:10] <abuayyoub> tw2113: yea! but im still having some problems.
[17:32:20] <tw2113> #wordpress-dev is the wrong room to ask for that though :P
[17:33:06] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  that was an accident lol  I just checked my website for errors on that W3 website ... http://bit.ly/LhRUZR I see it fixed the HTML errors but the problem is I don't know what file to edit? I went through like 90 files and have no idea where this is located? Where are pages stored in Wordpress?
[17:33:43] <tw2113> well look at line numbers, hit view-source to see what is on that line, then look for those
[17:34:04] <tw2113> up to line 68 will be in your header.php
[17:34:58] <tw2113> somewhere right below your H1 tag with "Stream" in it, there's a script block with <pre> tags around it
[17:35:13] <tw2113> chances are you don't need the pre tag at all
[17:36:10] <tw2113> your copyright 2012 Gun.ly paragraph tag has an extra </a> in it. not sure where exactly that'd be
[17:36:41] <tw2113> and then right before the closing </body> you have a stray </div>
[17:36:49] <tw2113> so that'd be footer.php
[17:36:52] <abuayyoub> not sure, footer maybe? I got hundreads of php and css files i searched most of them but I cant find any of this code thats there.
[17:37:10] <abuayyoub> Why dosen't it tell you which files its in. ?
[17:37:23] <tw2113> because it can't tell you which individual files it's in
[17:37:31] <tw2113> because it can just see the full picture
[17:38:05] <abuayyoub> ok
[17:38:15] <tw2113> think of it this way
[17:38:21] <tw2113> you can see the individual puzzle pieces
[17:38:28] <tw2113> the validator can just see the picture on the box
[17:38:42] <abuayyoub> Hey, do you know CSS at all? All my text seems to be doubled,, did you notice that?
[17:38:44] <abuayyoub> ahhhhh Ok
[17:38:48] <abuayyoub> thats a good way to think of it haha
[17:38:57] <abuayyoub> I understand now
[17:42:45] <tw2113> where is <div id="footer"> defined?
[17:42:48] <tw2113> do you know
[17:43:50] <tw2113> nevermind
[17:44:29] <Misiur> abuayyoub: I suggest you using html5 doctype, or xhtml 1.1 strict
[17:44:38] <Misiur> first one is modern, second one is demanding
[17:45:57] <tw2113> i think whatever is providing the FolioGrid Pro markup has an error in it
[17:47:59] <tw2113> eh, thought i had the right spot
[17:48:37] <abuayyoub> i guess im just gonna have to go through each one of these errors 1 by one
[17:48:52] <tw2113> i wouldn't stress the meta ones much
[17:48:58] <tw2113> i already fixed 1
[17:49:10] <abuayyoub> oh cool.
[17:49:32] <abuayyoub> like I went thgough about 40 different php pages and css files looking for this string <meta property="og:site_name" content="gun.ly"> but i couldnt find it anywhere
[17:49:47] <abuayyoub> where it's missing a"
[17:50:03] <Misiur> abuayyoub: Go into wp-content/themes/_your theme name_ and tell what files do you see
[17:50:16] <abuayyoub> ok
[17:50:39] <tw2113> abuayyoub the meta tags are invalid in everything but the html5 doctype
[17:52:06] <abuayyoub> this is what I got in my theme /FolioGridPro folder
[17:52:08] <abuayyoub> http://imgur.com/3l5n3
[17:54:59] <Misiur> Meta tags are coming from wp_head() function, so plugins are loading them. Change your doctype to html5 and give us link to validator
[17:55:31] <tw2113> i'm on a couple things
[17:56:17] <Misiur> og:* metas are facebook related FYI
[17:56:29] <tw2113> oh open graph
[17:56:59] <Misiur> yup, it's used for providing links info and stuff
[17:57:22] <Misiur> I can't think straight anymore, and it's 3AM. It was fun today - goodnight everyone
[17:57:54] <abuayyoub> Misiur:  goodnight, you must be on my side of the planet :D 3AM here too been at this for 19 hours so far today lol
[17:59:23] <tw2113> abuayyoub go revalidate
[17:59:48] <abuayyoub> oh man thats awesome!
[17:59:51] <abuayyoub> how did you do it?
[18:00:03] <abuayyoub> So I can know for next time
[18:00:05] <tw2113> i fixed the issues
[18:00:22] <tw2113> changed that long tired doctype to just <!doctype html>
[18:00:30] <tw2113> that got rid of all the meta tag ones
[18:00:37] <tw2113> deleted the stray </div> tag in the footer
[18:00:52] <tw2113> deleted the <pre> tag that was wrapping the shortcode for the plugin on the stream page editor
[18:01:06] <tw2113> and added a blank <a> tag in front of the copyright spot on page.php
[18:01:18] <tw2113> which i determined to be the right one, thanks to a plugin named "show template"
[18:01:31] <tw2113> i'll leave that installed for you for further debugging of other things
[18:01:44] <abuayyoub> amazing, so it looks like it's functioning properly the plugin. Think there is just some kinda CSS problem now because it dosent look right.
[18:01:49] <tw2113> all it does is leave an html comment in your wp_footer() output with the template name used
[18:01:49] <abuayyoub> oh nice
[18:01:59] <abuayyoub> man your amazing
[18:03:50] <tw2113> dark.css, line 15
[18:04:01] <tw2113> applies a text-shadow to all of the text
[18:04:15] <tw2113> body {
[18:04:15] <tw2113>     text-shadow: 0 2px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0);
[18:04:15] <tw2113> }
[18:04:48] <tw2113> same with line 6 for body a {}
[18:04:55] <tw2113> what sort of fuckery is that
[18:06:08] <abuayyoub> i want to delete this shadow
[18:06:14] <abuayyoub> it messes with quite a few things
[18:06:22] <tw2113> dark.css in the first 20 lines
[18:07:19] <tash> when i click on my "open-dialog" button it opens the form at the bottom via the itemDialog.  Anyone happen to know why when my modal form opens up, the "start" datepicker seems to automatically b selected? ( it shows the calendar of the datepicker as if I had clicked in it ). http://pastebin.com/huBJbgDX
[18:07:57] <jonkersjoe> I'm thinking of using contenteditable, but I haven't really noticed this on many sites, instead normally a textbox is used. If you do use it, or had used it has there been any issues ?
[18:08:46] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  ok I deleted text-shadow: 0 2px 0 rgb(0, 0, 0);
[18:08:58] <abuayyoub> in dark.css did you say its in a nother place too>
[18:09:53] <tw2113> read through the first 20 lines of that file
[18:10:02] <tw2113> and look for moments of "text-shadow"
[18:12:33] <abuayyoub> yea i deleted it. it looks good now
[18:12:45] <abuayyoub> there is still an outline
[18:12:52] <abuayyoub> but the double shading thing is gone
[18:13:01] <tw2113> dump your cache
[18:16:23] <abuayyoub> humm dumped, i still see a black line around the icons, do you see it or is it just me?
[18:16:30] <tw2113> abuayyoub thoughts: turn caching off until you're done developing the site :P
[18:16:42] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  thats a very good idea
[18:16:44] <RonWhoCares> Hi Everyone
[18:16:46] <abuayyoub> i will do it now
[18:16:48] <abuayyoub> howdy Ron
[18:16:55] <tw2113> .singlepost img {
[18:16:55] <tw2113>     border: 1px solid rgb(68, 68, 68);
[18:16:55] <tw2113> }
[18:17:06] <tw2113> Ron...who cares?
[18:17:13] <tw2113> oops you hadn't asked your question yet
[18:17:32] <Whirl3d> no, no no, that's Ron, who cares....
[18:17:47] <tw2113> abuayyoub you really need to get yourself familiar with firebug/chrome inspector
[18:17:48] <Whirl3d> you know as opposed to Ron who doesn't care...
[18:17:54] <tw2113> or if you're an oddball, Opera Dragonfly
[18:18:06] <RonWhoCares> I am needing help understanding why a JQuery script isn't running
[18:18:07] <tw2113> Whirl3d who care's a lot? </faithnomore>
[18:18:15] <tw2113> because it's broked
[18:18:16] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  yea im just learning about it. I have dedicated firefox specifically to my development
[18:18:17] <tw2113> next!
[18:18:26] <tw2113> really abuayyoub ?
[18:18:33] <abuayyoub> man coda2 for mac is awesome
[18:18:38] <tw2113> i've dedicated firefox to my everyday browser including webdev
[18:18:53] <tw2113> sublime text is better
[18:18:53] <abuayyoub> I use chrome for broswing and stuff
[18:18:56] <Whirl3d> RonWhoCares, get to the point, my man. Say it. What is the problem.
[18:19:01] <rodd> sublime is nice
[18:19:21] <rodd> but I also like netbeans, too bad it's heavy
[18:19:22] <abuayyoub> .singlepost img {
[18:19:22] <abuayyoub>     border: 1px solid rgb(68, 68, 68);:
[18:19:23] <abuayyoub> }
[18:19:25] <abuayyoub> where is this?
[18:19:26] <rodd> and needed for some java projects
[18:19:28] <tw2113> isn't it heresy in here to say you use chrome for your regular browsing, and firefox for your webdev?
[18:19:39] <abuayyoub> lol maybe lol
[18:19:41] <tw2113> abuayyoub line 61
[18:19:56] <abuayyoub> im a noob what can I say :D you guys dont like Chrome?
[18:20:07] <tw2113> i'm saying most jizz over chrome in here these days
[18:20:15] <tw2113> and say firefox is old and bloated
[18:20:19] <rodd> true
[18:20:56] <tw2113> i may be a bit blunt today :D
[18:21:19] <RonWhoCares> I can't figure out why a script isn't activated when the <select> option is switched.    http://jsfiddle.net/NLpw6/
[18:21:20] <Whirl3d> tw2113, you have always been blunted to me, dear...
[18:21:23] <rodd> just got jellybean on my nexus, whoa
[18:21:28] <abuayyoub> i dont think firefox is old or blated it used to be a few versions ago
[18:21:30] <Whirl3d> oh, wait,,,I mean...lool
[18:21:33] <jdeisenberg> I have a <div id="#dialog"> which I open with jquery ui dialog. When I then use jQuery to modify its contents on the fly, it doesn't seem to update properly.
[18:21:48] <tw2113> i stick to firefox aurora
[18:21:55] <RonWhoCares> The only thing I can come up with is that this <select> is part of a form that is displayed as the result of a menu option <select>    Am I correct?
[18:21:57] <tw2113> so i'm like 12 weeks ahead
[18:22:21] <abuayyoub> I found .singlepost img { border:1px solid #444; } in dark.css should I delete it? tw2113
[18:22:29] <Whirl3d> RonWhoCares, you might want to consider setting your handler to handle the change not the click event
[18:22:50] <tw2113> do you want borders on images in other singlepost views?
[18:23:02] <RonWhoCares> Whirl3d: What would this look like?
[18:23:10] <abuayyoub> no, i i dont think i need them do you?
[18:23:10] <tw2113> abuayyoub i'd put .page-id-938 in front of it
[18:23:24] <tw2113> wait wait
[18:23:28] <abuayyoub> ok
[18:23:30] <Whirl3d> change the word click to chage and just see if anything is different
[18:23:37] <tw2113> right AFTER that declaration
[18:23:51] <jdeisenberg> ah. found part of problem; I can't spell "assessment" consistently.
[18:23:52] <tw2113> .page-id-938 .singlepost img { border: none; }
[18:24:18] <abuayyoub> ok
[18:24:38] <tw2113> that way images inside a div that has a class of singlepost ONLY on this page
[18:24:40] <tw2113> don't get a border
[18:24:52] <tw2113> yay body classes
[18:25:40] <abuayyoub> ok so, it should look like this then... .singlepost img .page-id-938 .singlepost img { border: none; }
[18:25:46] <Whirl3d> RonWhoCares, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/NLpw6/1/  all I did was change the 2 words out and it now can't reach the server (meaning it works). yw
[18:25:47] <tw2113> no
[18:25:47] <abuayyoub> wait, thats not right
[18:26:29] <abuayyoub> ok im in dark.css right now line 61 says .singlepost img { border:1px solid #444; }
[18:26:37] <tw2113> .singlepost img { border: 1px solid rgb(68, 68, 68); } .page-id-938 .singlepost img { border: 1px solid rgb(68, 68, 68); }
[18:26:41] <abuayyoub> i should change it to
[18:26:55] <abuayyoub> gotya
[18:26:58] <tw2113> i changed my mind and told you to add a new selector for just on this page
[18:27:07] <tw2113> crap, messed up my paste
[18:27:14] <tw2113> .singlepost img { border: 1px solid rgb(68, 68, 68); } .page-id-938 .singlepost img { border: none; }
[18:28:28] <abuayyoub> woooot wooot wooot it's gone !
[18:28:34] <abuayyoub> www.boukay.com/stream
[18:28:37] <abuayyoub> yea baby oh man
[18:28:40] <abuayyoub> how sweet it is
[18:29:11] <RonWhoCares> Whirl3d: I don't see that error Whirl3d
[18:29:20] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  i would like to extend you my most humble thanks I would be honored to kiss your feet if I ever were to meet you
[18:29:21] <RonWhoCares> Whirl3d: I don't see that error Whirl3d  (Not reaching the server)
[18:29:22] <abuayyoub> haha
[18:29:48] <Whirl3d> did you look in the console?
[18:34:52] <abuayyoub> tw2113: one last thing :D if you dont mind. How do I make my page empty? Right now it has some formating and stuff from my template which i think is stoping the site to expand like it should. Any idea how I can just keep the header and remove everything else including Discuqus? because if you look at it it looks beautiful but it seems limited to 3 cols and they are very small
[18:35:09] <abuayyoub> it's like it still making space for the sidebar even though i disabled it
[18:36:44] <tw2113> *shrug* i'd have to look at it all a lot closer
[18:37:33] <RonWhoCares> Whirl3d: Yes
[18:38:32] <RonWhoCares> Whirl3d: This <select> is displayed as part of a form based on an initial <select>   Does the lack of id=account_source  not being on the website when the webpage was first loaded have any effect on this?
[18:41:41] <teear> I am funky
[18:44:32] <LoneStar99> would there be any reason to using yui and jquery in the same project?
[18:45:06] <hacfi> LoneStar99, I did it once because YUI's drag'n'drop is amazing
[18:45:29] <hacfi> but nowadays I'd settle for one
[18:45:41] <hacfi> YUI if you know it already, jQuery if you don't
[18:48:09] <LoneStar99> hacfi, so the drag and drop in YUI is better than Jqueries?
[18:48:30] <hacfi> used to be
[18:49:05] <hacfi> haven't tried it recently but if you want it to work on iOS maybe you need a small extra file
[18:49:12] <hacfi> wait...I have it somewhere
[18:50:04] <LoneStar99> ok, cool just asking cuss was reading a write up on on YUI
[18:50:15] <hacfi> check out http://touchpunch.furf.com/, https://github.com/furf/jquery-ui-touch-punch/ and http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-for-ipad-and-iphone/
[18:50:59] <LoneStar99> If i wanted to write an iOS app could I do it mostly with jquery? or would i need to know alot of ObjC?
[18:51:04] <hacfi> YUI is great but takes a long time to learn im comparison to jQuery and support is worse because the release cycle is so long
[18:51:28] <hacfi> oh...I'm the wrong guy to talk to...no experience
[18:51:59] <hacfi> I have to do one soon but I'll focus on HTML5, CSS & JS..so little to no ObjC
[18:52:01] <LoneStar99> hacfi:  yeah, have used prototype, enyo, and jquery and so far i like jquery and prototype, but will stick with jquery for now
[18:52:09] <hacfi> you should look for an iOS channel
[18:53:02] <LoneStar99> i will when the time comes, still building up the web service, then down the line will release iOS app
[18:53:06] <hacfi> stick with jQuery then..I spent 1-1.5 yrs on YUI only to realize that it's so much harder and ppl want you to write everything in jQuery
[18:53:24] <LoneStar99> yeah
[18:53:33] <LoneStar99> lots of support of jquery
[18:54:19] <hacfi> my YUI app started crashing on IE..I spent a day or two trying to find the reason
[18:54:47] <LoneStar99> interesting read --> http://uoid.me/yui1
[18:55:40] <hacfi> turns out the most recent YUI version had a bug with the window resize event..there was a fix available in the forum but they need two or three months to release the next version containing the fix
[18:55:56] <hacfi> wasn't too happy about that
[18:56:04] <hacfi> you couldn't use their cdn version
[18:56:57] <hacfi> jQuery would release a hotfix within a few days
[18:57:07] <hacfi> well.if it's that severe
[18:59:58] <LoneStar99> ok, right on
[19:03:00] <Jesdisciple> ah! long after I'd given up, a related search found this: http://matthewbj.github.com/Colors/
[19:03:30] <Jesdisciple> it can't do all the possible math, but it does complementary colors which was the important part
[19:03:43] <hacfi> Jesdisciple, thanks for the link...looks great!
[19:13:35] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  you still here man? Check it out it looks great ah? www.boukay.com/stream
[19:20:18] <LoneStar99> Jesdisciple: what is that used for? like suggesting colors for themes?
[19:21:08] <Jesdisciple> in my case, I have user-provided colors for a very basic DOM-based game I'm messing with
[19:21:15] <Jesdisciple> and I need to make sure they show up
[19:21:17] <LoneStar99> oh ok
[19:21:21] <Jesdisciple> no white on white or anything
[19:21:25] <LoneStar99> right on
[19:23:40] <LoneStar99> oh ok, so to prevent 'white on white" black on black or to close of colors
[19:24:58] <LoneStar99> kewl
[19:29:07] <LoneStar99> learned about sprites today one image with all the icons, is sweet
[19:36:37] <Foxhoundz> LoneStar99: It's a bother to maintain unless you absolutely need that kind of an optimization
[19:38:00] <tw2113> ahhh the novice webdevs
[19:38:48] <tw2113> so young...so corruptable
[19:38:59] <Foxhoundz> tw2113:  Do explain
[19:39:18] <tw2113> troll by teaching all the bad practices
[19:39:27] <tw2113> aka i'm just kidding
[19:39:50] <tw2113> the novice part came from LoneStar99 mentioning just finding out about sprites
[19:44:49] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  hey hows it goin man?  you back?  check it out www.boukay.com/stream it looks pretty pimp ah?
[19:45:30] <tw2113> yes, I did a good job making that webpage
[19:45:36] <tw2113> and it looks like one too
[19:45:40] <abuayyoub> Should be 4 coloums not sure why it wont scale but other than that I think we got it man. Thank you again.
[19:45:45] <abuayyoub> haha yes, you did a fantastic job
[19:45:56] <tw2113> tweak your csses
[19:46:15] <tw2113> check which files are being used to render the page, edit that template as needed
[19:46:22] <abuayyoub> ok
[19:47:07] <abuayyoub> man, you really helped me out alot I couldn't have done it. What was your hourly rate again? hehe
[19:47:41] <tw2113> $40
[19:47:58] <LoneStar99> Foxhoundz: to late icons already converted to one sprite...
[19:49:44] <abuayyoub> Is this what you do for a living you a web designer?
[19:49:50] <abuayyoub> I like it but its just so much to learn
[19:50:03] <tw2113> web developer, yes
[19:50:18] <tw2113> if you're afraid of how much there is to learn, you're definitely in the wrong field
[19:50:27] <abuayyoub> CSS, PHP, HTML, JAVA Script, i need a dozen years to learn it all
[19:50:30] <tw2113> given that there is always more to learn and it's constantly in flux and moving
[19:50:54] <abuayyoub> well, i didnt even know HTML till about 2 months ago
[19:51:12] <tw2113> but quite frankly, if you think about it, it's a career field that is in demand
[19:51:33] <bwq> abuayyoub: so how did you fix it?
[19:51:52] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  fixed it
[19:52:00] <tw2113> as i've mentioned to others, small businesses may not be able to hire new workers in-house
[19:52:05] <bwq> i mean, how did he fix it :p
[19:52:10] <abuayyoub> bwq:  tw2113  fixed it  hes a gangster
[19:52:13] <tw2113> but if it means more business to what they have, they'll find budget for a website
[19:52:13] <abuayyoub> haha
[19:52:31] <tw2113> bwq you mean his validation errors?
[19:52:50] <bwq> validation errors got in the way of that javascript zintro error?
[19:52:57] <abuayyoub> i had a whole bunch of errors also i had some template files that were messed up. it was a whole bunch of messed up
[19:53:11] <abuayyoub> oh, the Zintro error you know what that was
[19:53:11] <abuayyoub> haha
[19:53:11] <tw2113> i left for a bit and when i came back, his scripts/styles were loading in the right place finally
[19:53:36] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  yea what I did is I called the guy and he sent me another file
[19:53:46] <abuayyoub> i erased everything and re-uploaded
[19:53:48] <abuayyoub> and it worked
[19:53:49] <tw2113> then all that was left at that point was an old doctype, a stray </div> tag, some extra <pre> tabs that weren't doing anything
[19:53:56] <bwq> lol
[19:54:01] <abuayyoub> i think he sent me a botched version on accident kinda an anti piracy thing
[19:54:02] <bwq> i told you the error was in the script itself
[19:54:03] <abuayyoub> not sure
[19:54:06] <tw2113> and for the extra </a> tag?
[19:54:13] <abuayyoub> i think they jacked up the script for pirates
[19:54:16] <tw2113> i just went to the start of that output and put a <a> tag
[19:54:21] <abuayyoub> and somehow i got it messed up
[19:54:26] <abuayyoub> anyhow the new one worked
[19:55:09] <tw2113> in his view source, he now has <a>&copy; 2012 Gun-whatve</a>
[19:55:16] <tw2113> whatev*
[19:55:27] <bwq> hahaha
[19:55:31] <bwq> and you charged $40 for that?
[19:55:36] <tw2113> i wish
[19:55:39] <bwq> :D
[19:55:49] <abuayyoub> this is strange there are options to choose the number of columns in the shortcode, I set it to 4 but its still stuck on 3... do you guys see 3 or 4 columns? www.boukay.com/stream
[19:55:51] * tw2113 haz bills, but i have other income for that too
[19:56:06] <bwq> i see 4
[19:56:09] <bwq> refresh with ctrl+R
[19:56:14] <tw2113> same
[19:56:58] <abuayyoub> [dc_social_wall id="1278" cols="4" max="limit" limit="50" order="random"]
[19:57:04] <abuayyoub> you see 4?
[19:57:07] <tw2113> yup
[19:57:12] <abuayyoub> ok let me check in a different browser
[19:57:20] <tw2113> ctrl+shift+r is your friend
[19:57:21] <tw2113> hard refresh
[19:58:26] <abuayyoub> i tried in a new browser still getting 3. Think it could be my screen size?... i wouldnt think so
[19:58:38] <tw2113> i'm at 1024x768
[19:59:24] <abuayyoub> ok in chromium i get 4 but in firefox and chrome i get 3 also get 3 in Seamonkey
[19:59:25] <abuayyoub> strange
[19:59:32] <abuayyoub> man it looks great im so happy
[19:59:57] <tw2113> caching is a bitch
[20:00:05] <abuayyoub> yea i shut it off
[20:00:10] <abuayyoub> im gonna dump it again
[20:00:24] <abuayyoub> how often should I dump it when the site is up? or just leave it?
[20:00:40] <tw2113> once you're done tweaking it all the time, the purpose is to just leave it
[20:00:46] <tw2113> it'll update itself as needed
[20:00:57] <abuayyoub> BTW if you guys ever need a sick deal on a gun ill get you the best prices in the world
[20:00:58] <abuayyoub> :D
[20:00:59] <tw2113> but that's when changes are a bit slower
[20:01:11] <abuayyoub> tw2113:  ok cool
[20:02:21] <abuayyoub> that is if you like guns haha
[20:02:26] <abuayyoub> lots of people dont
[20:03:59] <tw2113> use the chance while we still have the 2nd amendment
[20:04:07] <phonebook_> youll need those guns for the coming apocalypse
[20:04:23] <tw2113> phonebook_ the government elected officials aren't that fast
[20:04:37] <tw2113> they're all old and out of touch, well, most of them
[20:05:04] <phonebook_> i dont think the second ammendment has ever been incorporated into the 14th ammendment - so the state can still legislate it - i think
[20:05:51] <tw2113> anyways, before i steer too far off topic, i'm going to shower
[20:06:27] <abuayyoub> man this is so wierd i dumped the cashe, hard refresh and in firefox im still getting 3 cols.
[20:06:39] <abuayyoub> its just me though ah?
[20:06:42] <phonebook_> i think what i am trying to say is they can still make guns illegal at the state level
[20:06:43] <abuayyoub> you guys using firefox?
[20:06:52] <phonebook_> ff is worst browser
[20:07:18] <phonebook_> safari ftw
[20:07:33] <abuayyoub> phonebook_:  yea, california, DC, Jersey, New York all have pretty much tried as hard as they can to ban guns
[20:07:41] <abuayyoub> oh yea lemme check safari
[20:08:36] <abuayyoub> beautiful in SAfari
[20:09:07] <phonebook_> nm apparantly it has - in 2010 the supreme court said having a gun for protection is a fundamental right and incorporated it into the 14th ammendment
[20:09:37] <phonebook_> safari is my favorite, easy to clear cache and databases, disable cache, is webkit/has webkit inspector, rarely crashes isnt creepy like chrome
[20:09:37] <abuayyoub> this whole UN treaty thing is gonna cause a whole lot of problems if it passes
[20:09:52] <abuayyoub> yea, i ahve had quite a few problems with Chrome
[20:10:14] <abuayyoub> i use it 95% of the time but some websites it just dosen't like
[20:16:40] <tash> sorry that this is a repost ... when I click on my button "open-dialog" I'm opening the <div> at the bottom of the page as a dialog form...for some reason my "start" datepicker acts like it was clicked or selected immediately when the form opens ( it shows the calendar instead of just looking like a plain text box ).  Any tips? http://pastebin.com/huBJbgDX
[20:21:59] <phonebook_> im looking at your code but not sure if ill be able to give an answer
[20:22:28] <phonebook_> i see youre using jquery ui - no chance you could be persuaded to put it in jsfiddle?
[20:26:28] <tash> phonebook
[20:26:32] <tash> yeah, prolly could
[20:27:01] <phonebook_> maybe you can specify the state of the datepicker int he options for it?
[20:30:30] <tash> maybe, but in some other code I have it doesn't happen
[20:30:36] <tash> I'm going to go look at it and see what's up
[21:07:53] <teear> hiya
[21:10:57] <MACscr> Ok, so $('.datepicker').datepick(); only seems to work if i only have a single class assigned to the <input> im trying to assign it to. Is that a plugin issue or am i missing something jquery related?
[21:12:34] <MACscr> nvm, it must be conflicting with another class.
[21:12:55] <teear> yeer not a fairy, yee must be j-fairy
[21:14:04] <Rickard> hello does anyone have experience with jquery ui because when I make an element draggable it seems to create this weird trailing effect when I drag it
[21:14:13] <teear> yeer dick is so queery it cannot handle j-fairy
[21:14:39] <MACscr> Seems when i have "required datepicker small hasDatepick", it doesnt work. Found out it was "hasDatepick" that was causing the problem. No idea why it was even there. =P
[21:15:16] <teear> Fuck my arse
[21:16:27] <Rickard> I'm going to make another version of the webpage and see if I can show you an example
[21:16:28] <teear> "I would, but this class won't let me to"
[21:16:41] <teear> haha
[21:18:12] <MACscr> teear: you drunk again?
[21:19:00] <teear> Mainly
[21:19:03] <Rickard> I just tested something and it seems that it only trails over elements embedded in flash
[21:19:10] <Rickard> I mean
[21:19:13] <Rickard> flash objects
[21:19:16] <Rickard> does that make sense?
[21:19:17] <nardev> hello, i want to have universal selector for all fields that heeds to be with auto complete, so i made backend to function properly, i have this now: http://paste.debian.net/179135/  but the problem is that $(this).attr('id')   returns "undefined" instead of id of input that is being used
[21:19:41] <njbair> I'm trying to use an ajax HEAD request to check whether a file exists on my server. I'm using the success and error callbacks, but a 404 causes chrome to error out and abort the whole script. Is this supposed to happen?
[21:19:42] <MACscr> Rickard: yes it does. Flash sucks ass
[21:19:54] <MACscr> why the heck are you using it?
[21:19:56] <teear> If I flash objects in the weekends I usually end up being captured by teh police
[21:20:26] <teear> Rickard, I flash objects often
[21:21:03] <Rickard> MACscr: my client wants to stream video games and it requires an embedded flash livestream he also wants draggable elements on the same page and they must be able to be dragged over the objects
[21:21:35] <MACscr> it doesnt have to be flash for it to be live video
[21:21:42] <nardev> Rickard, change a client :)
[21:21:49] <teear> Sometimes I flash only my backside not the frontside so the chance of being captured by the police drops by 50%
[21:21:49] <nardev> before it's too late
[21:22:05] <MACscr> flash is very close to being EOLed. its foolish to use it for new projects
[21:22:31] <MACscr> adobe itself is starting to limit its support
[21:22:36] <MACscr> for flash
[21:22:45] <nardev> would anyone be able to look in my issue pls :$
[21:23:22] <teear> I like flashing
[21:24:02] <MACscr> nardev: give us a jsfiddle example if you can
[21:24:35] <nardev> MACscr, i'll try
[21:24:42] <teear> Poker in the backend, liquer in the frontend
[21:25:30] <nardev> MACscr,  the system actually requires some logins.. :( not possible :(   however, IMHO i can explain it easily...
[21:25:30] <MACscr> teear: im just going to put you on ignore if you keep it up. All your doing now is adding static to the channel
[21:27:11] <teear> Static is hiss like something that is in yeear ears, but i can tell you that my volvo is a like a reindeer in teh wind, it blows your cocksucking jqueryman away
[21:27:38] <nardev> i have three <input...text class="autocomplete" id="one" >  <input...text class="autocomplete" id="two" >  <input...text class="autocomplete" id="three" >   and i want to have only one selector for  ('.autocomplete') and use it like this: http://paste.debian.net/179135/  the problem is that "$(this).attr('id')" doesn't return id of item that is called, it just returns "undefined"
[21:28:24] <teear> You must be doing something wrong
[21:28:29] <shoky> nardev: what makes you think that 'this' points to the element you want ?
[21:28:50] <nardev> shoky, :( i'm not very experienced with JS :(
[21:29:14] <teear> That's Jquery not JS
[21:29:31] <nardev> teear, ok, anyway, i just want to
[21:30:03] <teear> Learn to code
[21:30:04] <nardev> get id of an element that starts "autocompl.."
[21:30:07] <Rickard> nardev: maybe you can try event.target.id
[21:30:09] <shoky> nardev: ok, read about it. anyway, you want: $(".autocomplete").each(function() { $(this).autocomplete({ source: "..." + this.id, ...}) })
[21:30:26] <LoneStar99> what do you all recommend  for executing a function after sleeping 2 seconds?
[21:30:37] <shoky> LoneStar99: setTimeout
[21:30:42] <teear> Sleep more
[21:31:24] <teear> Why are you all so retarted
[21:31:32] <shoky> so much funner that way
[21:31:48] <phonebook_> $.each(".autocomplete", function() { $(this).css("border", "50px solid Red" });
[21:32:00] <LoneStar99> shoky ok thanks
[21:32:05] <nardev> shoky, there is really no other way but to create/initialize function for every ".autocomplete" :$
[21:32:10] <shoky> phonebook_: $(".autocomplete").each(function() {...})
[21:32:10] <LoneStar99> 200 is 2 seconds right?
[21:32:18] <nardev> thank you shoky
[21:32:21] <nardev> very much
[21:32:26] <LoneStar99> or is it 2000
[21:32:30] <phonebook_> or console.log($(this).attr("id"));
[21:32:32] <shoky> nardev: what do you think that your original try did inside? it did .each
[21:33:09] <shoky> LoneStar99: 1 millisecond = 1/1000 second
[21:34:55] <LoneStar99> k
[21:35:12] <teear> Yeer ass is farting rainbows
[21:35:16] <nardev> :( shoky i was thinking that it was just the meter of source :( actually it was stupid idea :( it needs to return data to different input fields.. there must be separate "instances" thank you
[21:36:09] <shoky> nardev: ok dont be sad
[21:36:28] <shoky> after all, teear's ass is farting rainbows
[21:36:38] <shoky> oh or was it ours
[21:38:40] <teear> :D
[21:40:18] <nardev> shoky, it works great, thank you.. OMG this jQuery worth wining Oscar :) it's pure movie magics :D
[21:40:54] <shoky> loll
[21:41:31] <coldhead> beautifully said, nardev
[21:42:06] <teear> better than farting rainbows
[21:42:09] <mekwall> resig is spielberg himself!
[21:43:16] <teear> It's like lesbian rainbows giving blowjobs to one another
[21:44:10] <teear> And if they need some movie magic, they'll buy a condom
[21:44:45] <shoky> try harder teear
[21:45:05] <teear> okay
[21:46:09] <teear> I need to be more specific
[21:46:23] <LoneStar99> on click how do I scroll to element <div id="foo">scroll here</div> ??
[21:47:06] <teear> You must a have a link to it somewhere: <a href="#foo">Link</a>
[21:47:33] <nardev> :) reason i said that is that i could make autocomplete with ajax for any field that i need in just 3-4 lines.. not actually coding, i would rather call it combining some lines of text properly.... this irc chan was also useful to me many times.. worth same as jquery it self :)
[21:47:55] <LoneStar99> teear i read somewhere that with html5 it works with element ids is that right?
[21:48:17] <shoky> LoneStar99 don't listen to anything he says (if you wanna learn)
[21:48:26] <shoky> he's a trolltard
[21:48:30] <teear> It's a friiking id
[21:48:32] <shoky> a really lousy one
[21:48:46] <LoneStar99> lol
[21:49:19] <teear> Any id works as a link target
[21:49:31] <shoky> LoneStar99 you can try scrollTo plugin
[21:49:42] <teear> It does not have to by an a element with a name atribute
[21:49:51] <LoneStar99> oh ok
[21:49:56] <LoneStar99> let me look into that
[21:50:11] <teear> I'm using scrollTo on one of my sites
[21:50:22] <teear> Smoothscroll is other plugin
[21:50:44] <teear> If you want it to slide like a smooth operator :D
[21:51:38] <mekwall> this is like jQuery: http://gifs.gifbin.com/102011/1317664598_kid_vs_water_hose.gif
[21:51:42] <shoky> k so he's not rly trolling now and actually said some true shit
[21:51:52] <LoneStar99> lol
[21:51:53] <LoneStar99> cool
[21:52:10] <teear> shoky you're so drunk you cannot even spell givemevodka
[21:52:27] <shoky> ew vodk
[21:52:28] <shoky> a
[21:52:34] <shoky> ew alcohol
[21:53:17] <teear> :D
[21:55:46] <phonebook_> test
[21:55:52] <phonebook_> test success
[21:56:00] <teear> this is not facebook
[21:56:23] <teear> this is sparta
[22:01:01] <teear> Mustanaamio
[22:07:25] <LoneStar99> thanks guys  $('#foo').scrollTo(); works perfectly
[22:09:23] <tw2113> so you're using the default parameters for it?
[22:09:45] <Chat4706> Hi ya
[22:11:00] <bencahill> Hey guys, I'm using Galleriffic with jQuery Zoom so on click-hold you have a 100% view of the image. The only problem is that if I go through a bunch of images fast, the HTTP requests for the large images start stacking up, causing a delay when I do want to view the 100% view (because it has to wait for all of the images to finish loading). Any ideas what I should do to alleviate this?
[22:11:53] <bencahill> Hmm, I've got an idea: load the image on mouse move...that could work.
[22:12:03] <bencahill> (because just going through pics I'm using the keyboard)
[22:24:05] <pandu101> Hi All. When I shift-tab to toggle thru the apps open, I noticed that when I reach the browser, it fires off an ajax request. The ajax request is only supposed to fire off on keyup. How can I stop this? Thanks
[22:36:44] <abletony84> hey
[22:36:52] <abletony84> im trying to integrate the ultra-awesome Select2 http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/#tags - http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/btM97/ - but how come the options list wont drop down? is it jsfiddle's fault or something?
[22:37:57] <Hopeless> heyho
[22:38:40] <coldhead> pandu101: when you are shift-tabbing you ARE submitting a keypress
[22:39:13] <coldhead> so either don't use shift-tab OR check in your event handler for the specific keys you are interested in and only fire the AJAX when you see one of them
[22:39:23] <Hopeless> for what can i use the .text()-function for? i'm german and don't get it .. =/
[22:40:18] <coldhead> Hopeless: it lets you get/set the text of an element: $('<p>this stuff <em>here</em></p>').text() === 'this stuff here'
[22:40:50] <Hopeless> ohh, it filters the html-parts :D thy :)
[22:42:15] <Hopeless> does it have a private chat here? :)
[22:44:50] <jonkersjoe> I seem to have performance issue with one of my functions that is creating dom objects. Is there a way  to determine which part of the function is taking the time ? I've tried look at the time it is taken from the start of the function to the end of the function, and there's about a 1 second delay (due to the second delay the lag is visible).
[22:46:02] <LukeNukem> Hey jquery buds
[22:46:14] <coldhead> ?nopm @ Hopeless
[22:46:14] <bot-t> Hopeless, Please keep all questions and code in the channel so everyone has a chance to help and benefit. Only privately message someone if he/she specifically requests it, e.g. for cyber.
[22:46:19] <Hopeless> hey Luke :)
[22:46:30] <coldhead> lukey <3
[22:47:13] <Hopeless> okay .. then here .. seems like you're good at javascript and jquery - do you work on custom scripts? for money? @coldhead
[22:48:01] <coldhead> i'm much too busy, Hopeless :) but if you put a brief together you're welcome to link to it here for someone like LukeNukem to contract for you
[22:48:14] <abletony84> LukeNukem: whats up lil' nigga
[22:48:23] <LukeNukem> yo abletony84, it goin good.
[22:48:29] <LukeNukem> Hi Hopeless
[22:48:45] <Hopeless> Hey LukeNukem ^^
[22:48:49] <LukeNukem> coldhead, hows it goin?
[22:49:26] <coldhead> sunday afternoon is rapidly expiring :(
[22:49:34] <LukeNukem> its morning here
[22:49:57] <LukeNukem> but sunday nonetheless
[22:50:59] <Hopeless> @coldhead: a brief? a description of my needed solution?
[22:51:39] <LukeNukem> Hopeless, he means a working example of whatever the issue you are facing on jsfiddle
[22:52:35] <coldhead> either that or a description of the work you need someone to do with the links and designs or whatever else is appropriate
[22:52:43] <samzhao_> hi everyone, I need some help. I'm creating a portfolio thing where when you hover on an image, an semi-transparent overlay appears on top of it with some contents. I'm using delegate to do this, but 'this' keyword doesn's seem to be working
[22:53:03] <Hopeless> that's the problem .. for THIS problem i have no solution neither a working example :D I wanted to ask how much it would cost me to let someone else script this ..
[22:53:15] <LukeNukem> Hopeless, what do you need done?
[22:53:41] <LukeNukem> also one thing to remember is to use simple code as much as it is possible, it helps debugging and gets the job done quicker :)
[22:55:14] <samzhao_> here's the basic code structure i'm doing: http://jsfiddle.net/TcYHZ/
[22:55:31] <shoky> samzhao_: you put 'this' as a string..
[22:56:17] <Hopeless> LukeNukem: I've got a php script which creates tables .. Every table has some td's with different values, like price, name of product or amount of something. Now I need a js-function which recognizes the values of some form inputs and compare all these values with every td .. if one td doesn't fit the filter the whole containing table shall be hidden
[22:56:29] <samzhao_> darn it!
[22:56:34] <samzhao_> shoky: got it...thanks
[22:57:57] <Hopeless> LukeNukem: In short - You've got a product overview and can specify the delivered items within a form ..
[22:58:27] <samzhao_> shoky: another problem, when i set delegate
[22:58:51] <shoky> samzhao_: wat
[22:58:51] <b-ot> whats happening is this thing happened i guess
[22:59:24] <Hopeless> and he left .. requested work to extreme ._.
[22:59:27] <Hopeless> bye dudes!
[22:59:45] <shoky> btw samzhao_, do .appendTo(this)  not .appendTo($(this))
[23:00:17] <samzhao_> shoky: im actually getting the parent of all the items, which is #shot, but when my mouseenter more than one items, both of the items remain covered with the overlay
[23:00:58] <shoky> hm?
[23:01:07] <samzhao_> um...how can i show you this..
[23:01:33] <samzhao_> well i mean it makes sense, because i $('#shots').deleagate('.item', 'mouseenter'......
[23:01:35] <shoky> with a working fiddle
[23:01:40] <samzhao_> ok
[23:01:44] <samzhao_> hold on
[23:02:35] <samzhao_> http://jsfiddle.net/TcYHZ/
[23:02:46] <shoky> that's the same one
[23:03:02] <samzhao_> http://jsfiddle.net/TcYHZ/1/
[23:03:16] <shoky> that's not a working fiddle ;P
[23:03:43] <samzhao_> how come? how come it doesnt work in the fiddle..
[23:03:54] <shoky> you didn't choose jquery
[23:04:22] <samzhao_> (facepalm..) thanks
[23:04:29] <samzhao_> http://jsfiddle.net/TcYHZ/2/
[23:05:25] <shoky> you want a new overlay for each item?
[23:05:43] <shoky> you're appending a new overlay on each mouseenter
[23:05:48] <samzhao_> well, I just dont want to hard code .overlay in the html
[23:05:58] <samzhao_> ya, that's the problem, and i don't actually want that
[23:06:12] <shoky> you had it fine before, donno why you cahnged it
[23:07:13] <shoky> it's a css issue
[23:07:21] <shoky> you need .item { position:relative }
[23:07:23] <samzhao_> well i have no idea, i just change from having a variable outside of the function which is var overlay = $('<div class="overlay"></div>') to putting it inside of the function
[23:07:29] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TcYHZ/3/
[23:08:43] <shoky> a bit clearer with the explicit .detach()   http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TcYHZ/4/
[23:09:50] <samzhao_> what does that do?
[23:10:18] <MimiEA_sleeping> I wrote a little plugin and would like some feedbacks and critics... let me know what you guys think :  http://c9.io/mimieam/jquery_training/workspace/test.html
[23:10:20] <shoky> .detach()?  it detaches the element from its current position in the DOM
[23:10:27] <shoky> and then you append it elsewhere
[23:10:59] <samzhao_> it's certainly working in the fiddle, but somehow doesn't work on my site..
[23:11:39] <samzhao_> should i set #shots to have position: absolute?
[23:11:55] <samzhao_> i dont thin kso..
[23:12:48] <shoky> samzhao_: dont think that'd matter
[23:13:10] <samzhao_> and by using detach the fading effect doesn't really apply anymore
[23:13:15] <shoky> the .item { position:relative } was needed in order to make the item div's be considired "positioned"
[23:13:40] <shoky> so that the position:absolute in the .overaly class would make the position relative to the positioned .item divs
[23:13:49] <shoky> the fading effect does apply
[23:14:00] <samzhao_> I understand that, and that's what i did in the beginning, but then it's not working so i tried absolute
[23:14:01] <shoky> but you're doing .stop() on mouseenter
[23:14:10] <shoky> so it stops right away when you move to a different item
[23:15:01] <samzhao_> i thought you need to use stop() so that someone dont mess around with it by moving their mouse around the image quickly
[23:15:28] <shoky> yep
[23:15:55] <samzhao_> or do i only need it in mouseleave?
[23:17:55] <shoky> you need it if you want to stop the animation
[23:19:19] <samzhao_> but that also stops it when you move over to other images...
[23:19:50] <shoky> you need to think about what exactly the effect is you want and what is needed for it
[23:20:30] <shoky> maybe you want 2 overlay elements, so you can have one fade out while the other is fading in, for example
[23:20:35] <samzhao_> im copying this theme
[23:20:35] <samzhao_> http://incorporatedtheme.tumblr.com/
[23:22:44] <shoky> well then you got some work to do ;p
[23:23:44] <samzhao_> i actually only need the hover effects for now
[23:23:45] <abletony84> im trying to integrate the ultra-awesome Select2 http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/#tags - http://home.no/dwaynie/select2/ - anybody know why it won't display though? im using the same code as in http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/btM97/
[23:23:50] <LoneStar99> anyone have experience with adding search providers to ie9?
[23:26:21] <shoky> abletony84: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/btM97/3/
[23:27:40] <abletony84> shoky: yup, but why wont it display at http://home.no/dwaynie/select2/ when its the same code as yours?
[23:28:35] <abletony84> i took out style="width:300px" from the html though
[23:29:31] <shoky> why
[23:29:31] <b-ot> shoky, david_mark back?
[23:29:51] <shoky> abletony84 the select2 is there but it has width 0
[23:31:09] <LukeNukem> did Hopeless get his solution coldhead
[23:31:24] <abletony84> shoky: cool
[23:31:28] <abletony84> had no idea that was it
[23:31:31] <abletony84> thanks
[23:31:34] <shoky> you even mentioned it yourself ;)
[23:31:39] <shoky> so you had SOME idea ;)
[23:32:51] <coldhead> no LukeNukem, he gave up in despair when your connection pinged out
[23:33:17] <abletony84> shoky: well, yeah ok maybe
[23:33:54] <LukeNukem> god darn India with its stupid power cuts
[23:33:57] <LukeNukem> what was the issue coldhead
[23:34:27] <coldhead> we didn't get that far, he wants to pay someone to do something for him
[23:34:32] <coldhead> i don't think he's a coder
[23:34:40] <coldhead> i had no idea you were in india, LukeNukem
[23:34:45] * coldhead takes notes
[23:34:47] <LukeNukem> now you do ^_^
[23:35:02] <coldhead> we're all on the same page now
[23:35:24] <LukeNukem> man my weed dealer got busted now im really pissed.
[23:35:28] <LukeNukem> is weed legal where you come from?
[23:36:04] <coldhead> no
[23:36:09] <coldhead> it's not viciously policed
[23:36:15] <coldhead> but it's still 'gainst the law
[23:36:28] <LukeNukem> >:{ why is the govt making a plant illegal
[23:36:48] <coldhead> especially in india, you guys invented buddhism and yoga
[23:36:57] <LukeNukem> we did? ohb we did
[23:36:59] <coldhead> its a violation of human rights, i tell you!
[23:38:06] <LukeNukem> inventing buddhism?
[23:40:33] <ragas> ?
[23:55:32] <coldhead> prohibiting a plant on the continent where buddhism was invented/discovered is my complaint
[23:58:26] <systemfault> Less plantsâ€¦ more samosas
