[00:00:02] <kasi> hey any one suggest me to enable vertical scrollbar in ui-subgrid in jquery....pls
[00:00:31] <zoobamafu> Cork, got a tip for me?
[00:01:52] <Cork> zoobamafu: not a generic one, just make sure your waiting for all the events and callbacks from network loads to be sure you don't get race
[00:07:09] <Eartz> good morning
[00:11:59] <beancurd> hooome timmmeee
[00:12:01] <beancurd>  :H
[00:12:03] <beancurd> :
[00:12:05] <beancurd> :D
[00:12:31] <coldhead> maybe for you, pal
[00:12:50] <bastetmilo> Hi. I have  simple jQuery script for login form displaying on hover. And when I try to click on autosugestion my form dissapear. Well I know it is normal behavior, but is there a way to change it? I know I could change hover for click, but I want to "repair" that for hover now. Is it possible?
[00:17:40] <Hereisanotherlie> bastetmilo: you don't want the form to disappear when they click off of it?
[00:17:41] <Mazi> Hi jQuery experts, I have a question on the general workflow when using $(document).ready(function()): Say there is a HTML page which has a "next" button at the bottom. this page also includes an iFrame. I generally want to hide the button until a certain action at the iframe enables it. is it possible to have a jquery $(document).ready(function()) before the iframe is included to disable the button and then also include a $(doc
[00:17:41] <Mazi> ument).ready(function()) statement at the end of the iFrame to enable the button?
[00:18:34] <Mazi> ...so that the second jquery code enables the previously disabled button? would that work because the code added last is executed a little later?
[00:20:09] <Eartz> in your iframe you can do something like parent.$('#mybutton').show();
[00:20:09] <_ikke_> Mazi: afaik, iframes from different domains can't 'communicate'
[00:20:31] <Eartz> but it implies the iframe is from the same domain
[00:20:38] <Eartz> ak _ikke_ said
[00:20:51] <Eartz> *as
[00:21:25] <Mazi> Eartz, so this would work if the iframe source is located in a folder within the folder the main HTML file is placed in?
[00:22:48] <Eartz> It's not exactly about the folder it's about the domain name. Say your main page is 'mysite.com/index.html', if your iframe is 'mysite.com/test.html' it will work
[00:23:00] <Eartz> if your iframe is 'othersite.com/test.html' it won't
[00:23:28] <Mazi> Eartz, thanks for the help
[00:23:41] <Eartz> you're welcome
[00:23:48] <Flo0815> hey. can somebody give me a hint how to load data in a table via ajax when the user scrolls down the list and reaches the end? like in google image search?
[00:23:48] <Mazi> _ikke_: thanks to you as well, will try this out
[00:25:29] <Hereisanotherlie> Flo0815: are you talking about infinite scroll?
[00:29:16] <bastetmilo> Hereisanotherlie: I dont want form to disapear when I hover cursor on autosuggestion.
[00:30:02] <Eartz> Flo0815 : you can use the scroll event and the scrollTop and scrollHeight attributes of your element, that's what I would do. Don't know if there's something better to do this though
[00:31:03] <Flo0815> Eartz: I'm trying to use the scroll event, but nothing happens...?
[00:31:20] <Flo0815> $('#myelement').live('scroll', function...
[00:31:54] <Flo0815> Hereisanotherlie: yes i do
[00:32:21] <Eartz> live is deprecated (if your using jQuery 1.7+), use .on instead. Do you have a jsfiddle or something ?
[00:32:41] <Flo0815> jep sec.
[00:33:20] <raj> Cork, still around?
[00:33:27] <Cork> yup
[00:33:34] <raj> nice :)
[00:35:11] <coldhead> are you going to be sending flowers to your special #jQuery saviours, raj ?
[00:35:18] <coldhead> that would be a very nice gesture
[00:35:36] <Flo0815> .on is not a function?! wtf
[00:35:50] <coldhead> you are using an older jQuery?
[00:35:56] <Flo0815> 1.7.1
[00:36:05] <coldhead> o_O
[00:36:23] <Flo0815> ui and jquery tools also
[00:36:29] <Cork> Flo0815: console.log($.fn.jquery)
[00:36:31] <Flo0815> maybe this is a problem?
[00:36:41] <Cork> sorry
[00:36:44] <Cork> Flo0815: console.log($.fn.jQuery)
[00:36:53] <Hereisanotherlie> is there any reason to use $(document).ready(function() over $(function() besides readability?
[00:37:14] <Flo0815> Cork: 1.6.4 ...?!
[00:37:17] <Cork> Hereisanotherlie: no, and readability, depends on who you ask
[00:37:19] <Flo0815> aeh?
[00:37:30] <Cork> Flo0815: so you have multible versions of jquery loaded?
[00:37:38] <Flo0815> not that i know
[00:37:41] <coldhead> Hereisanotherlie: just use the longer form and no one has to get hurt
[00:37:46] <Flo0815> but maybe the tools include jquery
[00:37:56] <raj> Cork, I'm having an issue with a widget ( https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/blob/master/js/jquery.fileupload.js ) line 818 and plugin ( http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drop/demo/selection the file is jquery.event.drop-2.0.js), apparently 'drop' is causing an issue one way or another
[00:38:23] <raj> coldhead, dudes usually don't want flowers :)
[00:38:54] <raj> and yes, Cork is definitely a #jquery savior of mine :)
[00:39:07] <Cork> raj: uh your sure about line 818?
[00:39:18] <raj> .bind('drop.' + ns, {fileupload: this}, this._onDrop)
[00:39:23] <Cork> uh...
[00:39:30] <raj> when I look at it raw, it's 753
[00:39:40] <coldhead> everyone likes flowers, let's end the stereotype
[00:39:41] <Cork> its 806 in github
[00:39:43] <coldhead> plant genitals
[00:39:47] <coldhead> WHO WOULD REFUSE
[00:39:47] <Flo0815> Cork: it was jq tools. it included jquery 1.6.4
[00:39:59] <coldhead> lol jQ tools
[00:40:03] <raj> something's wrong iwth my github line numbers, i just realized
[00:40:05] <coldhead> the missing framework
[00:40:09] <raj> it's all off
[00:40:19] <Flo0815> but still no scroll event is captuers
[00:40:21] <Flo0815> captuered
[00:40:26] <raj> https://raw.github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/3de48c611ef52ece9c9b185e9e8e6fe2ba45ec76/js/jquery.fileupload.js
[00:40:30] <raj> that has no linenumbers though
[00:40:54] <raj> oh, source
[00:41:02] <raj> yes, 806
[00:41:15] <Cork> raj view-source:https://raw.github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/3de48c611ef52ece9c9b185e9e8e6fe2ba45ec76/js/jquery.fileupload.js
[00:41:41] <raj> it's 806
[00:41:53] <Cork> raj: but what fails at that line?
[00:41:56] <raj> so 806 then runs line 773
[00:42:16] <raj> which gives me an error with .dataTransfer can't happen on null or whatever
[00:42:28] <raj> can't read property 'dataTransfer' of null
[00:42:39] <Cork> raj: _onDrop is a widget default handler
[00:42:47] <Cork> its from the mouse widget
[00:43:08] <raj> but .bind('drop.' ...) i think is causing the issue on line 806
[00:44:00] <Cork> raj: if i'm to contribute anything to this, i need to see live code
[00:44:16] <Cork> i've never used any of those plugins, so...
[00:44:34] <raj> crap
[00:45:00] <raj> that's gonna take a really long time to put together
[00:45:57] <Cork> raj: from what the code looks like that should work, but its just dead code, so can't really tell what order things happen
[00:46:29] <Flo0815> how can i detect which element is scrolled?
[00:46:33] <Cork> and its a plugin with over 1k lines, so its not something you just skimms and understands
[00:46:51] <Cork> Flo0815: by listning to the scroll event on that element
[00:46:51] <raj> fileupload was fine actually
[00:47:03] <raj> only once I added jquery.event.drop.min.js did this happen
[00:47:20] <raj> (which is from the draggable selection plugin)
[00:47:21] <Flo0815> Cork: but i'm not quite sure which element is scrolled
[00:47:38] <Flo0815> it's a div, containing a form, containing multiple divs and tables
[00:48:10] <Flo0815> so i need like a: if something is scrolled, gimme the name of the scrolled thing-function
[00:53:20] <Eartz> inside your callback you can use $(this), which is the jQuery objet of the element that triggered the event
[00:53:42] <Cork> Flo0815: scroll doesn't propagate, so you need to find on the scrolling element
[00:53:43] <juha-> $("#jquery").append("Hello");
[00:54:42] <Flo0815> Cork: i tried it on nearly every element...nothing happens
[00:54:44] <Cork> Flo0815: you could use a $('*') but thats about as nasty as it can be
[00:54:54] <Flo0815> a simple console.log('test');
[00:55:25] <Flo0815> still nothing with $('*')
[00:55:52] <Cork> Flo0815: http://jsfiddle.net/XrM96/
[00:56:27] <Flo0815> i'm preparing a fiddle with my stuff
[00:56:29] <Flo0815> sec
[01:06:45] <Flo0815> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/t5GCw/1/
[01:07:18] <Cork> Flo0815: live doens't bind on the element
[01:07:23] <Cork> it binds on document
[01:07:29] <Cork> and as i said scroll doesn't propigate
[01:07:37] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/t5GCw/2/
[01:07:53] <Flo0815> oha
[01:08:03] <Eviltwin> This is why .live is deprecated
[01:08:14] <Cork> on with a selector is the same
[01:08:21] <Cork> its no difference what so ever
[01:08:29] <Eviltwin> No, there's a very important difference
[01:08:30] <Cork> Flo0815: http://jsfiddle.net/t5GCw/3/
[01:08:53] <Eviltwin> .on with a selector doesn't look like you're doing a .bind on that selector
[01:09:05] <Cork> true
[01:09:12] <Cork> live was a mistake from the start
[01:09:26] <Cork> delegate should have been the one used
[01:10:05] <Cork> and that actually makes live more costly as it always has to do a dom search, that it doens't use
[01:10:06] <Flo0815> i'm going mad....
[01:10:11] <Flo0815> it doesn't wrok
[01:10:13] <Flo0815> *work
[01:10:18] <Flo0815> wtf is the difference
[01:10:25] <Flo0815> between fiddle an my stuff
[01:10:31] <Cork> Flo0815: you need to use the selector after the element has been added
[01:10:35] <raj> Cork, I guess I'll try implementing the selection box at a later time...cuz replicating that issue would take quite some time
[01:10:38] <raj> thanks for looking though
[01:10:54] <Cork> np
[01:11:05] <Flo0815> Cork: the selector after the element was added...? wht u meand
[01:11:11] <PavelloZ> cant you use .on('scroll', 'selector') ?:)
[01:11:16] <Cork> no
[01:11:23] <Cork> scroll doens't propagate
[01:12:17] <Cork> Flo0815: live binds another element (the document) and checks the event.target when the event propagates up to the bound element
[01:12:27] <raj> if I do $.get(), shouldn't the url have the get parameters?
[01:12:37] <Cork> Flo0815: thats how you can bind and listen for an element that doesn't exist yet
[01:12:45] <Eviltwin> raj: That's a very vague question
[01:13:09] <Cork> Flo0815: but as scroll doens't notify the parent, you need to bind the element directly, so it has to exist when you run the bind/on call
[01:13:24] <Flo0815> ah ok
[01:13:27] <Flo0815> hm
[01:13:49] <Flo0815> so i should put this in the callback of my element-create-function
[01:13:50] <Cork> oh... nice :/
[01:13:50] <Flo0815> part
[01:14:04] <Cork> jquery ui slider doesn't work at all on mobils -_-
[01:14:15] <Cork> Flo0815: yes
[01:14:17] <PavelloZ> yea, i had problem with it...
[01:14:35] <PavelloZ> you have to fix it by using something to support touch
[01:14:51] <Cork> actually i think i'm going to build my own instead
[01:15:11] <Cork> i'm not using jquery ui for this site, and if it doesn't work... might as well build it from scratch
[01:15:54] <raj> Eviltwin, if I do a GET with a form (non-js), it puts the parameters in the url, such as mywebsite.com/?abc=123&xyz=345
[01:16:06] <raj> however, with $.get, that doesn't happen
[01:16:12] <Flo0815> Cork: no difference. The element is there from the beginning, i just load the content of the table via ajax. I put the binding in the callback of the ajax-tablefill-function, but nithing happens
[01:19:44] <Eviltwin> raj: How are you using it?
[01:19:53] <Eviltwin> Show a pastebin or jsFiddle
[01:20:49] <nights``> is there a table with browsers versions and jquery support yes/no ?
[01:21:15] <nights``> like for IE <6.0 = NO
[01:21:45] <Flo0815> Cork: thx for ur help. found the mistake
[01:21:53] <Cork> ah
[01:22:07] <Flo0815> and i don't want to talk about it....
[01:22:08] <Flo0815> -.-
[01:22:12] <Cork> XD
[01:22:18] <Cork> no need
[01:22:24] <Flo0815> but thx anyway
[01:22:28] <Cork> np
[01:34:18] <poppiez> anyone with google maps experience? I am to draw a lot of polygons on a map. polygons can be contained in each other, intersect, overlap etc. I need a way to structure them. the best bet is probably to alter the visual experience depending on the zoom level. any thoughts?
[01:35:03] <Eviltwin> Sounds like a #javascript question
[01:35:10] <poppiez> Eviltwin: alright, thx :)
[01:35:17] <nights``> is there a table with browsers versions and jquery support yes/no ?
[01:35:18] <nights``> like for IE <6.0 = NO
[01:35:19] <PavelloZ> sounds like google-maps-api question :D
[01:35:55] <Eviltwin> nights``: Mouseover "Cross-browser" here: http://jquery.com/
[01:36:03] <nights``> ok thanks
[01:36:05] <nights``> let me have a look
[01:36:22] <nights``> ah
[01:36:36] <nights``> opera and chrome all versions then?
[01:36:37] <nights``> sounds weird
[01:36:46] <Eviltwin> nights``: Or this: http://docs.jquery.com/Browser_Compatibility
[01:37:01] <nights``> cool
[01:37:02] <nights``> thanks
[01:37:05] <nights``> very useful
[01:51:02] <branr> Hi, is there a way i can scroll so that a div ends up in the middle of the screen?
[01:51:25] <Eviltwin> Yes
[01:51:45] <branr> Oh goody! How would i go about that?
[01:52:05] <Eviltwin> You would use $("#mydiv").offset().top to figure out where the top of it is
[01:52:23] <Eviltwin> Combine that with $("#mydiv").height() to figure out where the middle of it is
[01:52:40] <Eviltwin> You would use $(window).height() to figure out how tall the window is
[01:53:08] <Eviltwin> Combine that with $(window).animate({scrollTop: ...}) to make it scroll there
[01:56:04] <branr> Thanks,  i'm a total noob at this
[01:56:15] <branr> So would typing this work?
[01:56:16] <branr> $("#resized").offset().top + $(window).height()/2 - $("#resized").height()
[01:56:30] <branr> (inside the animate thing of course)
[01:56:49] <Eviltwin> I think those signs might be flipped for the heights
[01:56:52] <Eviltwin> But I could be wrong about that
[01:57:05] <Eviltwin> Something to try
[02:00:13] <ChrisTheSorcerer> For visibility, I would put it into variables... var heightDev = $(window).height()/2; var heightRes = $("#resized").height(); var offsetTop = $("#resized").offset().top; Then you could just write offsetTop + (heightDev - heightRes) or something like that... if I haven't misunderstood the syntax completely...
[02:00:30] <raj> Eviltwin, i was getting an error serverside
[02:00:36] <raj> hence the url wasn't changing
[02:02:04] <raj> can I do {name:'raj', mylist:['1a','2b','3z']} for the $.get() query parameters?
[02:02:15] <Cork> yes
[02:02:16] <Eviltwin> Yeah, that should be fine
[02:02:21] <raj> cool
[02:02:31] <raj> time to make major changes to my code
[02:02:37] <raj> i've been posting out of habit
[02:02:42] <raj> now i'm switching it all to gets
[02:02:52] <Eviltwin> Well there's a reason there's more than one HTTP method
[02:03:02] <Eviltwin> They mean different things
[02:03:46] <raj> yeah, i was being lazy before and it's now bit me in the tuchis
[02:04:10] <Eviltwin> Also be aware that XSS is possible with GET
[02:05:39] <raj> so I need to add a token to my query parameters?
[02:06:13] <Cork> Eviltwin: how would get be more suseptive to xss then post the same ajax call (unless your talking about ssl cryptated trafic)
[02:08:11] <Eviltwin> I guess what I'm referring to is where you either embed an <IMG> or <SCRIPT> into an unrelated site or get the the victim to open a link sent in chat or email
[02:08:35] <Cork> that doens't really have anything to do with ajax get
[02:08:54] <Eviltwin> No this was a question of the server METHOD choice
[02:08:58] <Cork> ajax appending unfiltered user added content can be adde through post or get no difference there
[02:09:30] <smftre> Hello, I'm having an odd issue here, I am looping through returned JSON data, and if I view it by doing: (firebug) console.log(theDataItem) it shows, but if I do alert(theDataItem) it doesnt!?!? anyone experienced this?
[02:09:31] <Cork> well there still no difference
[02:09:59] <Eviltwin> I guess I was really referring to a potential CSRF issue
[02:10:00] <Cork> the only difference between get and post is the string first in the http header, and where the parameters are positioned
[02:10:01] <Eviltwin> I misspoke
[02:10:26] <Eviltwin> It's 4am here
[02:10:41] <raj> so should i be using a token, either way?
[02:11:03] <Cork> raj: you should verify that the other party uses what you've given them, yes
[02:11:19] <Eviltwin> You should read this and see what works for you: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting#Reducing_the_threat
[02:11:21] <Cork> raj: tocken is one way to do that
[02:11:32] <Eviltwin> This: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery#Prevention
[02:11:49] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[02:12:06] <Eviltwin> It's much too late
[02:12:44] <Cork> smftre: you can't alert an array or object
[02:13:15] <Cork> smftre: you might have an array or similar around the string your trying to use
[02:13:20] <raj> so I do $.get with some js generated hash
[02:13:29] <Larholm> smftre, JSON.stringify(theDataItem)
[02:13:32] <Cork> smftre: or if its an object/array your trying to show use JSON.stringify
[02:13:34] <Eviltwin> ?alert
[02:13:34] <bot-t> Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[02:13:36] <raj> and then serverside, I just make sure I return it?
[02:13:42] <Eviltwin> Isn't really ideal for debugging anyway
[02:14:04] <Cork> raj: no you should use a server generated key
[02:14:08] <Eviltwin> raj: Really what you want is to get a token from the server (randomly generated there)
[02:14:14] <Eviltwin> And use that key in subsequent requests
[02:14:21] <Eviltwin> Otherwise it could be forged by an attacker
[02:14:26] <raj> hmm
[02:14:49] <Eviltwin> The point is that valid clients need a secret
[02:14:55] <Eviltwin> That invalid clients can't possibly have
[02:15:05] <Eviltwin> And you want to be immune to replay attacks
[02:15:27] <Eviltwin> So hashing the query alone is out
[02:15:49] <raj> so I generate a key on the server, and put it in the url. and then subsequent requests from the client must contain that key
[02:16:13] <Eviltwin> Yes
[02:16:20] <Larholm> raj, most server frameworks have built-in CSRF protection that you can sue
[02:16:48] <Larholm> asp.net, rails, tornado, etc
[02:17:18] <MacroMan> I'm thinking on making a web app to produce jQuery animation in a WSYIWYG window. Before I embarked on planning for this I want to know if this already exists somewhere as I don't want to re-invent the wheel.
[02:17:26] <MacroMan> I did some searching, but found nothing
[02:17:34] <osa1> what's the idiomatic way to add new attributes and methods to jquery dom objects?
[02:17:42] <Eviltwin> MacroMan: Doesn't sound familiar
[02:18:11] <Eviltwin> osa1: You add to "jQuery.fn" or "jQuery"
[02:18:13] <Cork> osa1: you mean new functions to jquery?
[02:18:26] <MacroMan> Eviltwin: thanks., I'll carry on with some searching for now, then I'll start researching
[02:18:29] <Eviltwin> Depending on what you're trying ot add
[02:18:39] <Eviltwin> osa1: See http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[02:18:51] <osa1> Cork: no, I have some DOM objects and I want to associate them with some other objects and functions
[02:19:12] <osa1> Eviltwin: hmm, I'm not writing a jquery plugin though..
[02:19:18] <Cork> osa1: a class or a data- prefixed attribute would be the way then
[02:19:54] <Eviltwin> osa1: Perhaps you should see ?data
[02:19:54] <bot-t> osa1, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[02:20:05] <osa1> Cork: the point is, it would be easier if I could get this extra data with $(id) selector
[02:20:40] <Cork> osa1: $(id).data('reference')
[02:20:51] <osa1> data is great
[02:20:53] <osa1> thanks all
[02:20:53] <Cork> or what ever
[02:20:59] * Eviltwin wins
[02:21:09] <Hypah> is there a way to delete a height property after setting it? for instance, after setting div.height(100), can I change my mind and somehow reset it to use whatever its natural height may be?
[02:21:20] <Eviltwin> .height("")
[02:21:27] <Hypah> thanks
[02:21:35] <Larholm> osa1, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2891452/jquery-data-selector and http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/dataSelector
[02:23:34] <raj> if that's the case though, a user will always be at www.mysite.com/39aw32somehashkey3289u3rj
[02:23:48] <Eviltwin> Wait, wait, wait
[02:23:52] <Eviltwin> You were talking about AJAX
[02:24:22] <Cork> ya, it should defenitly not be in the site url
[02:24:40] <Cork> that would surcomvent the hole purpos of the tocken
[02:25:21] <smftre> Cork, thanks, tried that, but didnt change anything
[02:25:34] <raj> Cork, i'd save it to session then?
[02:25:57] <Cork> raj: if you have a form put it in a hidden field
[02:26:06] <Cork> else echo it in a js variable or similar
[02:26:23] <Cork> then grab it from there and use it in the ajax call
[02:26:31] <smftre> Cork: e.g. http://pastebin.com/hAYX7fY4, that works well, but not so well in my js file... wtf
[02:27:11] <Cork> smftre: could you copy what your get in your json response?
[02:27:34] <Cork> (replace sensetive informaiton, but perserv the structure and types)
[02:28:14] <Cork> smftre: and it needs to be what the server outputs not what your use in php or what you expect :)
[02:28:23] <Cork> *you use
[02:28:25] <smftre> Cork: if I copy that "var data = ....." then it works, but if I get that data var from the ajax return it doesnt.... eventhough in firebug I can see that value..
[02:28:37] <raj> Cork, how would I put it in a js variable without doing an extra $.post to the server requesting it?
[02:28:50] <Cork> smftre: what your using for the ajax call?
[02:29:06] <Cork> raj: when you render the page
[02:29:11] <smftre> Cork: I'm using $.ajax and the "Response" is -> [{"vname":"Kingston Hospital","vcode":"KT2"}] which is expected
[02:29:26] <smftre> but doesnt work unless I pop that in a static var
[02:29:45] <raj> oh ok, so i'll just use a <script> for that, and not with my .js files
[02:30:12] <Cork> exactly
[02:30:29] <Cork> raj: it should be uniq per page load
[02:31:09] <raj> k
[02:31:31] <raj> thanks :)
[02:31:44] <Cork> smftre: your sure your getting json and not a string?
[02:32:06] <Cork> that is, your sure jquery actually parses the json string for you?
[02:32:08] <smftre> Cork: No! :P my php echo's json_encode() is all
[02:32:25] <Cork> smftre: your setting the correct mimetype?
[02:32:29] <smftre> Cork:  and I grab it using function(data)
[02:32:37] <smftre> Cork: Let me check
[02:33:09] <Cork> "application/json"
[02:33:44] <smftre> Cork: I changed the PHP json headers and boom, works now! thank you for pointing me in the right direction! ;)
[02:33:54] <smftre> overlooked it..
[02:34:08] <chris_> guys quick question ...
[02:34:43] <chris_> where can I find a jquery ninja to come do some consultancy work for a couple of weeks ...
[02:34:49] <chris_> no jobs board on jquery.com
[02:37:11] <MacroMan> chris_: You might get someone reply on here, but if not, you can try the #freelance irc channel
[02:37:27] <ChrisTheSorcerer> chris_: There are often local or national programming boards, google for your region and jquery and one of the results on the first page is usually a forum from your region.
[02:39:10] <chris_> @ChrisTheSorcerer thanks!
[02:40:01] <ChrisTheSorcerer> No probs, mate
[02:40:57] <raj> Cork, does this only have to be done for authenticated users?
[02:43:53] <Cork> raj: not really, it needs to be done for anything getting sent to the server where you feel the data sent need to be verified to come from your page
[02:44:15] <Cork> raj: though that means you need to use it when you change data server side
[02:44:23] <Cork> and then you should be using $.post anyway
[02:44:38] <Eviltwin> I would do it for any action that's essentially read-only
[02:44:42] <Eviltwin> Right
[02:44:51] <Eviltwin> Err
[02:45:00] <Cork> * not read-only :)
[02:45:21] <Eviltwin> Remember what I was saying about it being 4am
[02:45:24] <Eviltwin> It's almost 5 now
[02:45:34] <Cork> Eviltwin: so go sleep
[02:45:43] <Eviltwin> I will be very shortly now
[02:53:32] <davidw> http://jsfiddle.net/ApBgw/2/ - I'm looking to drain the swamp a bit here.  First of all, IE9 doesn't work with the 'IE' code
[02:53:49] <davidw> I tried simply doing .width() and .height() but those don't work like setAttribute do
[02:57:38] <Twilo> hello, why does the command "jQuery('div#main table.ItemDetailContainer td[colspan=2]').attr('colspan', 3);)" is not working in ie 8?
[03:01:17] <Cork> Twilo: have you tried making a testcase ex. in jsfiddle?
[03:02:51] <Twilo> Cork: no - i never heard from jsfiddle
[03:03:48] <Woet> ?Demo @ Twilo
[03:03:49] <bot-t> Twilo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:03:55] <Twilo> i must use jquery 1.3.2 :-(
[03:04:32] <Twilo> ok, i'll try this
[03:15:47] <Flo0815> i try to use $.extend for a config of an ajax request. in dConfig are my default values, in customConfig the current values which should be used. so if it's like this: $.extend(true, dconfig, customConfig); will the defaultValues be overwritten if they are specified in customConfig, and if not the defaultValues are used?
[03:22:10] <Twilo> hm... it works on a minimal testcase :-(
[03:22:46] <Twilo> http://jsfiddle.net/xdUy2/3/
[03:24:47] <Larholm> Twilo, consider using THEAD and TBODY
[03:25:40] <Twilo> Larholm: the original html code is not mine
[03:26:03] <Larholm> ah, ie8
[03:26:04] <Twilo> Larholm: i cannot correct the html
[03:26:15] <Larholm> td[colspan="2"]
[03:26:26] <Larholm> what about it doesn't work in ie8?
[03:27:52] <Twilo> ie8 does not expand the colspan to 3
[03:30:14] <Larholm> check if you have a width set on those TD elements
[03:30:26] <Larholm> if you do, don't set it and let it expand by use of colspan, or set width to 100%
[03:31:01] <Larholm> btw, this is not a jQuery question, but IE8-specific as you mention. The problem is with the rendering, and that could be many things depending on your html and styles. E.g., are you running in strict mode?
[03:32:31] <Larholm> my guess is you have conflicting css
[03:32:57] <Twilo> i don't understand that
[03:32:59] <Twilo> http://jsfiddle.net/xdUy2/4/
[03:33:02] <Twilo> it works :(
[03:35:07] <Twilo> Larholm: here is the original html: http://paste.debian.net/161748/; why does the testcase works? hm...
[03:36:13] <Twilo> and here is the javascript: http://paste.debian.net/161750/
[03:36:14] <Trisox> prob [colspan="2"] is not reconized by IE
[03:36:20] <Trisox> the css selector
[03:36:35] <Twilo> i also try this with colspan="2"
[03:37:15] <Trisox> ah should work according to http://jhop.me/ie8-bugs
[03:37:33] <Trisox> Attribute selector (which matches the attribute, ‘colspan’ for TD and TH elements) matches every TD and TH element :P hmm
[03:37:53] <Trisox> its a bug..
[03:38:35] <quicksilver> easy enough to work around this particular bug in jQuery, at least.
[03:38:55] <quicksilver> jQuery colspan=2 selector will work and you can use that to apply/remove styles or classes or something.
[03:38:56] <Trisox> yea use attr
[03:38:56] <voidsheep> Is there any way to see if the data was successfully saved here: http://jsfiddle.net/Voidsheep/ar9nU/1/
[03:39:00] <iaj> Hey there.. is there some easy way to attach a class to my document.forms['vidform'].elements['uid1880']  ?
[03:39:01] <Trisox> check for true.. apply
[03:39:43] <Trisox> quicksilver: no its a css selector
[03:39:49] <Trisox> use attr to check for it
[03:40:46] <Twilo> how can i fix my problem?
[03:42:04] <Twilo> i'm not a jquery expert, that is my first contact with jquery :)
[03:42:17] <quicksilver> Trisox: I know it's a CSS selector.
[03:42:45] <quicksilver> Trisox: I'm saying that IE8 has a bug with certain CSS selectors, but jQuery will still be able to do them, so at least this bug is easy enough to workaround in jQuery.
[03:43:07] <fRAiLtY-> in jQuery, can I get it to alter a div above where the code is in the html page? So for instance, div1 is on line 5, jquery starts on line 50 and div2 starts on line 60.  I've got it editing div2 but not div1
[03:45:09] <Xotix> I have a contenteditable div and i want to clean up all incoming paste, how can i do that?
[03:47:23] <iaj> hey hmm... is there something wrong about that one, since the form is being submited but it should not :(   http://paste.pocoo.org/show/574919
[03:47:43] <lampe2> hey is there a way to get the x,y pixel from a picture with a click on that place with jquery?
[03:47:57] <quicksilver> iaj: that's not jQuery.
[03:48:28] <surial> Is an empty jquery object falsy?
[03:48:33] <quicksilver> no.
[03:48:46] <surial> so, if ($("#whatever").size() == 0)?
[03:48:49] <quicksilver> it's an object, all objects are true in javascript as far as I know.
[03:49:03] <surial> Well, jquery does a lot of magic, but I had trouble myself seeing as to how they'd manage that :)
[03:49:08] <quicksilver> yes.
[03:49:14] <surial> I can't find an isEmpty() method anywhere. size() == 0 it is then.
[03:49:31] <surial> Comes up not very often, what with .each() and such.
[03:49:36] <surial> I guess it's not all that needed.
[03:50:01] <lampe2> okay i got it :)
[03:50:21] <iaj> quicksilver: oh.. hmmm that might be mwjhy :D
[03:50:30] <iaj> can I make this stuff easier with jQuery
[03:50:36] <PavelloZ> u can use .length instead of size, i think :)
[03:50:40] <fRAiLtY-> This code works: http://pastie.org/3713788 but I just wondered is there a more compact/efficient way of doing it? A few of the bits I've done in the past you guys have corrected and made much more compact etc, I just wondered if this is possible here?
[03:51:09] <surial> quicksilver: Thanks :)
[03:53:23] <Twilo> argh... that also doesn't work: jQuery('div#main table.ItemDetailContainer td').each(function(index) {if (jQuery(this).attr("colspan") == "2") {jQuery(this).attr("colspan", "3");}});
[03:53:52] <Twilo> why? :-(
[03:54:53] <xec_> );}}); .. ouch
[03:55:08] <xec_> Twilo: did you make a demo of this earlier?
[03:55:55] <Twilo> yes a short demo - the demo work... but why? :-( http://jsfiddle.net/xdUy2/4/
[03:56:37] <xec_> Twilo: well, if the demo works, but not on your site, there is something on your site that makes a difference
[03:57:11] <Twilo> but what - i don't know
[03:57:15] <quicksilver> IE will probably be upset by that extra }, if that is indeed copy-pasted from your code.
[03:57:33] <quicksilver> why would you not just do:
[03:58:01] <quicksilver> $('div#main table.ItemDetailContainer td[colspan=2]').attr('colspan',3); ?
[03:58:06] <quicksilver> much easier to type and read.
[03:58:16] <xec_> quicksilver: that is basically his original code
[03:59:44] <fRAiLtY-> in jQuery, can I get it to alter a div above where the code is in the html page? So for instance, div1 is on line 5, jquery starts on line 50 and div2 starts on line 60.  I've got it editing div2 but not div1
[04:00:11] <quicksilver> xec_: OK, but why the change? The discussion I read was about IE8 having a bug in its CSS engine. That won't affect jquery's own selectors.
[04:01:00] <xec_> quicksilver: apparently he got some "help" from a confused person :P
[04:11:53] <comboy> I want to handle click event for all elemnts with say .foo class on the page, but these elements keep being added/removed on the page, and I always want to handle event for all of them
[04:12:17] <comboy> is there any way that avoids binding cilck after each new .foo element is added?
[04:12:43] <comboy> currently I just put onclick= with function call to avoid that, but maybe there is some more elegant solution for this problem?
[04:13:16] <quicksilver> comboy: read the docs for jquery 'on'
[04:13:29] <quicksilver> ?on @ comboy
[04:13:30] <bot-t> comboy, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:14:22] <Cork> comboy: you want the delegate section on that page
[04:14:25] <comboy> yeah, I mean sorry for deprecatied naming, but still, .on will only attach this event for selected set of elements, won't it?
[04:14:35] <Cork> no
[04:14:36] <comboy> ah
[04:14:42] <Cork> it has multible suntaxes
[04:15:01] <comboy> ok ok, I'm reading
[04:15:21] <comboy> thanks a lot quicksilver & Cork
[04:15:29] <comboy> I thought i'll be stuckt with this onclick
[04:17:09] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Ok, I've been trying to make a "save as"-script in PHP for the better part of the last 5 hours... I get some probs with the headers and the end file turns up 1kb larger than the start file. I was thinking of redoing it a bit and then call for it with AJAX instead, but are there any comparison tools that I can use to ensure that the file is an exact duplicate of the original?
[04:17:19] <Cork> suntaxes==syntaxes
[04:17:23] <ChrisTheSorcerer> the "file" here is a PNG
[04:19:20] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: where do you have the original file?
[04:19:27] <Cork> is it generated in a canvas or something?
[04:20:21] <ChrisTheSorcerer> it was originally, but later saved to the server in root/bin. The script I'm running to save it is in root/ext/php, so the searchpath is "../../bin/original.png"
[04:21:17] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: well you could load the data and use binaryarray to compare the two i guess
[04:21:23] <ChrisTheSorcerer> It does find the image, and it does replicate it, but for some reason it's like 1kb larger and corrupted, and the only thing I can think of is a header issue. That's why I need to compare it, and I think I remember some function like that in JQuery, but I can't find it right now
[04:21:55] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: not for raw img data no
[04:22:31] <ChrisTheSorcerer> aww, chucks... then I need to find another way to compare the images to see what it adds to the new file...
[04:23:01] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: if its a header problem, just check the top of the file with a text editor
[04:23:24] <Cork> if it is readable, then you know
[04:25:15] <nights``> hmm
[04:25:28] <nights``> anyone knows if jquery UI tabs is traversable by googlebot and other spiders?
[04:25:31] <nights``> (white hat spiders!)
[04:25:46] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Yup, sure enough. There's a %. before png in the new file, that isn't there in the old one
[04:26:25] <Cork> nights``: depends how you include the content
[04:26:47] <nights``> wdym?
[04:27:03] <Cork> nights``: if its ajax based, then no its not
[04:27:13] <nights``> ah
[04:27:20] <nights``> cus the bot has to post?
[04:27:22] <nights``> and it wont?
[04:27:33] <Cork> if you have a static structure you extend with js, then yes its completly traversable
[04:27:41] <nights``> hmm
[04:27:44] <Cork> nights``: the bot has to use js, and it won't
[04:27:49] <nights``> thats quite clever, maybe thats how i should do it
[04:27:58] <nights``> but then it would be so slow to load
[04:27:59] <nights``> geez
[04:28:07] <Cork> nights``: not really
[04:28:09] <nights``> google uses a fair part of JS now
[04:28:18] <nights``> cork: theres a lot of pics on each tab
[04:28:25] <Cork> ah
[04:28:32] <nights``> i really dont want to load everything
[04:28:33] <fRAiLtY-> This code works: http://pastie.org/3713788 but I just wondered is there a more compact/efficient way of doing it? A few of the bits I've done in the past you guys have corrected and made much more compact etc, I just wondered if this is possible here?
[04:28:39] <nights``> and if i display it only for google
[04:28:43] <Cork> nights``: well you could always cheat, and create a separate page generated for the bots
[04:28:43] <nights``> i will be banned for cloaking
[04:28:50] <nights``> thats called cloaking
[04:28:53] <Cork> ya
[04:28:56] <nights``> and will get you in trouble
[04:29:03] <nights``> unless your intent is good (which it is)
[04:29:05] <nights``> but better
[04:29:18] <nights``> discriminiate based on js / no-js
[04:29:32] <nights``> problem is i dont want people to be able to see the page at all if they are IE6 etc
[04:29:53] <Cork> nights``: uh... you shouldn't do that
[04:29:54] <nights``> but to not be judged as a cloaker i need to open it up to these scum
[04:29:59] <nights``> why not?
[04:30:03] <nights``> thats what google recommends
[04:30:04] <Cork> nights``: either don't add any work to support it
[04:30:17] <nights``> why not? i need those pages indexed by google
[04:30:23] <Cork> but if it "just works" don't make it break intentionally
[04:30:49] <Cork> nights``: i meant the not work in ie6 part
[04:31:05] <nights``> it doesnt really work
[04:31:12] <nights``> the page is designed for jquery only
[04:31:21] <nights``> but i can display parts of it with alternative code
[04:31:23] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Fixed the header issue, no need for jQuery today >.< (Darnit, I want to use it for everything :( )
[04:31:28] <Cork> nights``: so its built the wrong way from the start
[04:31:29] <nights``> but im not going to reprogram the entire site just for IE6
[04:31:35] <nights``> maybe it is
[04:31:41] <nights``> but now i need to indexed :)
[04:31:44] <nights``> i need it
[04:31:46] <nights``> even
[04:32:01] <Cork> nights``: you should build the page so it works with js off
[04:32:07] <Cork> then you don't ever get this problem
[04:32:11] <nights``> right
[04:32:16] <nights``> but its too much work to do that now
[04:32:28] <nights``> its not a hack here and there
[04:32:33] <nights``> but its a redesign of everything
[04:32:35] <Cork> nights``: just support a full page reload when they switch
[04:32:47] <Cork> thats all you need for it to work
[04:33:07] <nights``> hm i have loads of content displayed through jquery async requests
[04:33:28] <nights``> i know what to display, but its all displayed through js
[04:33:28] <ChrisTheSorcerer> nights: The easy way out would be a disclaimer, that's what I usually have on my pages... "If you can read this, your browser sucks. Download a proper browser!" kinda thing
[04:33:30] <Cork> well then you have a page that can't work without js, and your screwd anyway
[04:33:44] <nights``> ChrisTheSorcerer: yes, I had exactly that
[04:33:49] <nights``> but google wouldnt like that they can see the page
[04:33:54] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: a bit doesn't really care about a disclamer :)
[04:33:54] <nights``> but other no-js users get the fuck you page
[04:34:09] <Cork> bit==bot
[04:34:11] <nights``> i have to either show it to ALL no-js users or to non
[04:34:29] <nights``> or i will be branded as a cloaker (equal to high treason in googlebots world)
[04:34:39] <Cork> nights``: or you can have a script server side that let them change page
[04:34:50] <Cork> that would solve all problems
[04:34:51] <nights``> cork: what do you mean?
[04:35:05] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Yeah, people would see the cashed page... and that's not cloaking, it's proper design. You, as a developer, can't help that Google's bots aren't sophisticated enough
[04:35:24] <Cork> like i said, load the content render the page server side and let the none js users do a full page reload each time they switch
[04:35:37] <Cork> nights``: then add ajax ontop of that
[04:35:41] <Cork> and your done
[04:35:42] <nights``> chris: by cached page, you mean that your-browser-is-too-old page?
[04:35:43] <ChrisTheSorcerer> So unless you work for Google specifically, it doesn't really matter what they see or not
[04:36:07] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I mean that page you get when you hover over a link on the google search page, and the text below that link
[04:36:10] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: unless you care about the score
[04:36:14] <nights``> cork: yeah, but im using lots of jquery components which are not easily replaced
[04:36:37] <nights``> anyway, i guess i will start with this page
[04:37:06] <nights``> i will probably display a "your browser is too old" and the content
[04:37:12] <nights``> hopefully google will ignore the too old part
[04:38:12] <nights``> hmm
[04:38:18] <nights``> maybe time to implement IE6 support
[04:38:25] <nights``> everyone in this fkn country uses IE6
[04:38:30] <nights``> (japan)
[04:39:09] <ChrisTheSorcerer> IE6 is still the worlds most used browser
[04:39:22] <nights``> yeah
[04:39:30] <nights``> but i give them the finger right now
[04:39:45] <nights``> if they cant change their browser then i dont expect they will be able to checkout an order on my page either
[04:39:55] <nights``> probably their is a covariance atleast
[04:39:57] <nights``> there
[04:40:11] <ChrisTheSorcerer> that's why I'm surprised that MS haven't sent out any patch for it, because there's SOOO many people that can't/refuses to upgrade. Patch IE6 to work with jQuery, JS and HTML5, and a LOT of developer inconvenience would be gone
[04:40:18] <nights``> hmm
[04:40:33] <nights``> ChrisTheSorcerer: i read that last month there was a force upgrade
[04:40:40] <nights``> from IE6 to IE8
[04:40:43] <ChrisTheSorcerer> then again, I don't think Google could brand you for not supporting IE6, when they  dropped support for it almost a year ago
[04:41:02] <nights``> google doesnt support IE6??
[04:41:07] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Nope
[04:41:10] <nights``> wow
[04:41:14] <nights``> i have to see it
[04:41:24] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Many things works with it, but they don't have any official support for it any more
[04:41:36] <nights``> interesting
[04:41:43] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Facebook did the same... same with Youtube
[04:41:51] <nights``> yeah know about facebook and twitter
[04:41:55] <ChrisTheSorcerer> All the major players are dropping it now
[04:41:58] <nights``> thats why i decided not to care about IE6
[04:42:04] <nights``> but i really need this page indexed
[04:42:26] <nights``> so i will reimplement it for non-js practically for GoogleBot
[04:42:29] <nights``> not for IE6 users
[04:42:36] <nights``> cus they deserve nothing else than the finger
[04:44:09] <ChrisTheSorcerer> <script type="text/javascript"><!-- Code put here will be ignored by unsupported browsers --> but code put here will be read by all </script>  <-----seems like the simplest sollution, and I do believe Google would accept it
[04:44:28] <nights``> just use
[04:44:30] <nights``> <noscript>
[04:44:31] <nights``> i think
[04:44:43] <nights``> but the trouble is google do tyhink they suipport JS now
[04:44:49] <nights``> http://www.seroundtable.com/googlebot-javascript-css-14930.html
[04:44:53] <nights``> have a look at this statement from google
[04:45:48] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Well, you aren't hiding anything from the bots if you do like that, you're just hiding it from unsupported browsers
[04:45:56] <nights``> yeah
[04:45:58] <ChrisTheSorcerer> the bot can still see everything it could before
[04:46:16] <nights``> but that would mean i need to duplicate a lot of content
[04:46:23] <nights``> this is a lot of information to duplicate
[04:46:25] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Why?
[04:46:33] <nights``> probably i will just redesign the pages i want to be indexed
[04:46:42] <nights``> to allow no-js (googlebot exclusives)
[04:46:53] <nights``> and careless that actual no-js user cant use it
[04:47:49] <Cork> nights``: you know your breaking several of the fundamental design rules for the web right?
[04:48:23] <VernonK> You could always just build regular flat files and then add JS on top to Ajax in and retrieve just the content section.  That way your site is accessible to everybody.
[04:48:25] <Cork> you should never build a public site that way
[04:48:27] <nights``> cork: what is different for mine page vs like facebook?
[04:48:31] <nights``> *my
[04:48:33] <ChrisTheSorcerer> well, I wouldn't go through that much problem, they index almost any page that comes out anyway, and the score isn't everything, you can get top ratings with low scores too (as one of my websites does, it brings about 75 000 visitors per month and have a really low score due to some unfortunate words that the Virtual World community shares with the porn industry >.<)
[04:48:46] <Cork> nights``: facebook needs to have a logint
[04:48:49] <Cork> *login
[04:49:00] <nights``> no
[04:49:01] <nights``> they dont
[04:49:07] <Cork> nights``: when your in a login based enviroment its a different thing
[04:49:11] <Cork> yes you do
[04:49:11] <nights``> no
[04:49:36] <ChrisTheSorcerer> You can display facebook content without login, they even have an open API for displaying it without being on Facebook at all
[04:49:40] <nights``> https://www.facebook.com/maishoku
[04:49:46] <nights``> this works well without login
[04:49:54] <nights``> and its well indexed by google
[04:49:58] <nights``> without login
[04:50:14] <Cork> nights``: and it works well without js too
[04:50:17] <Cork> https://www.facebook.com/maishoku?_fb_noscript=1
[04:50:22] <nights``> so again, what is different between my page's strategy and the major players?
[04:50:26] <nights``> no it doesnt "work well"
[04:50:34] <nights``> let me show you the response from IE6
[04:50:57] <Cork> nights``: i don't care about ie6
[04:51:03] <Cork> none js doens't mean ie6
[04:51:27] <nights``> ok it took one page reload to mess up my IE6 session.
[04:51:28] <nights``> ok
[04:51:34] <nights``> so what do you mean?
[04:51:35] <Cork> it means ppl that has the sence to not run every peas of crap js on the web
[04:51:50] <nights``> you mean it displays for google?
[04:52:00] <Cork> yes
[04:52:06] <Cork> and if you turn js off
[04:52:06] <nights``> [20:47] <Cork> nights``: you know your breaking several of the fundamental design rules for the web right?
[04:52:11] <nights``> explain this statement
[04:52:14] <Cork> or if you (like me) use noscript
[04:52:17] <nights``> and how im different from facebook
[04:52:29] <Cork> its not, cause they don't
[04:52:33] <nights``> sorry for being harsh, but i simply dont understand.
[04:52:39] <Cork> they redurect you to a no js page
[04:52:50] <Cork> and there you can still access the content
[04:52:53] <nights``> hm no they dont? :S
[04:52:56] <nights``> ah
[04:52:57] <nights``> ok
[04:52:59] <Cork> THATS the point
[04:53:02] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I think what Cork means is that it was a bad choice of words to compare IE6 users to no-js-users ;)
[04:53:11] <nights``> Cork: but it still doesnt work for IE6?
[04:53:17] <nights``> that you said yourself
[04:53:27] <Cork> nights``: i don't git a rats ass about ie6
[04:53:30] <nights``> so thats exactly what im intending, a page that works for GoogleBot
[04:53:36] <nights``> or whats the difference?
[04:53:58] <nights``> Chris: ah, yeah....
[04:54:15] <Cork> nights``: if you build a page that doens't demand user login to access it, it should be posible to navigate it and access it without js
[04:54:18] <nights``> Cork: i think what you want to say is that a page should be browsable without JS?
[04:54:25] <Cork> yes
[04:54:26] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Nights, what Cork is trying to say is that a publically viewable page should be able to run without use of javascript.
[04:54:44] <nights``> but IE6 is a non-js browser and it doesnt work, so why is it that you dont give a rats ass about IE6?
[04:54:52] <VernonK> Yep... it's part of what's called "progressive enhancement".
[04:54:59] <Cork> uh ie6 supports js -_-
[04:55:06] <VernonK> IE6 numbers are so low at this point, it's not worth continuing support.
[04:55:17] <Cork> ie6 and non js has nothing to do with each other
[04:55:22] <nights``> VernonK: not in japan unf :( those idiots still use ie6
[04:55:22] <Trisox> indeed
[04:55:29] <Trisox> what Cork said
[04:55:31] <VernonK> IE7 numbers are falling too as Microsoft has added IE8 to Automatic Updates.
[04:55:35] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Thou I've always had problems with that premiss... Why use JS at all, if there's ways around it? If you can achieve the same thing without JS, and you HAVE to have the no-js version, why even bother with JS at all?
[04:55:38] <VernonK> True about Japan
[04:56:01] <nights``> VernonK: yeah, i read about those Automatic Updates, supposed to have happen mid last month, but was there actually a change? i havnt see any
[04:56:12] <Trisox> ie7 > ie8 whats the diference .... i mean ie8 > ie9 you can see the diverence there
[04:56:20] <nights``> <IE7 should be force upgraded to IE8
[04:56:20] <VernonK> Yeah because it screwed me in one of my VMs that I have set up for testing IE7
[04:56:23] <Trisox> just make it work ;-)
[04:56:30] <nights``> my page support IE7 and IE8
[04:56:34] <Cork> Trisox: ie8 is actually usable, while ie7 is slow like nothing else
[04:56:39] <Trisox> part of the job
[04:56:50] <Cork> (though i'm not saying ie8 is fast)
[04:57:11] <Trisox> Cork: true to that but still there both slow
[04:57:14] <nights``> cork: either you support a page fully without JS , not just render , but full interactivity... no?
[04:57:34] <nights``> like the links on facebook will make the viewing break down
[04:57:47] <Cork> nights``: you should be able to read all valid content
[04:57:53] <Trisox> yup
[04:58:08] <Cork> if you need to "switch view" it should do a full page reload
[04:58:15] <Trisox> just use links.. if js use event.preventDe...
[04:58:16] <nights``> Cork: well, its useless for me. i only make money when people checkout
[04:58:20] <Trisox> and use your ajax stuff
[04:58:27] <nights``> the only reason i would support viewing is for things to get indexed
[04:58:49] <Cork> nights``: and you most likly lose some costumers cause if the way you construct it
[04:58:51] <Trisox> most users use js
[04:58:51] <nights``> i dont have dev power to do both a simple and an advanced version (which is the only thing real users are interested in)
[04:58:58] <nights``> cork: well, i have to choose
[04:59:04] <Cork> no you don't
[04:59:04] <nights``> its difficult to maintain both versions.
[04:59:16] <Trisox> wy?
[04:59:23] <Cork> it doens't take almost no extra work to support them both if you do it right
[04:59:26] <Cork> uh..
[04:59:28] <nights``> why are you so quick to respond, you have no idea what type of service im offering.
[04:59:30] <Cork> *it takes almost no
[04:59:35] <Trisox> :D
[04:59:55] <Trisox> does take some work Cork for sure
[05:00:01] <nights``> thanks!
[05:00:04] <nights``> it does in fact
[05:00:10] <nights``> thats why google , facebook, twitter etc dont care
[05:00:10] <Cork> Trisox: i said almost
[05:00:14] <Trisox> if you make an SPA its hard ;)
[05:00:25] <nights``> otherwise they could branch off a IE6 version and have people work full-time on that
[05:00:27] <Trisox> Single Page  App
[05:00:40] <nights``> actually, they should be able to afford that so i think its says a lot that they are not doing that
[05:00:44] <Guest89008> you guys have a spammer: cinndy
[05:00:49] <Trisox> mostly its ie7 up
[05:00:50] <overbythere> IE6.. http://imgur.com/gallery/yMkRc
[05:00:52] <Cork> nights``: ... learn what things are if you are to argu about it
[05:00:53] <nights``> we are 2 developers....wait, one just quit, so 1...
[05:00:54] <nights``> ;)
[05:01:30] <nights``> Cork: yeah i know what things are. well, if you are to say IE6 is JS support, let me revise that to no jquery support.
[05:01:48] <Flo0815> hey. if i create an object like var obj = {key: val, key2: val2); is it possible to define a function instead of a value which calculates a value and saves it in the object?
[05:01:52] <Cork> nights``: and then your back at the start
[05:01:53] <nights``> im already going a long way to render IE8 pages with CSS Pie etc
[05:02:24] <Trisox> wy ?
[05:02:25] <nights``> VernonK: do you know if those force upgrade campains were successful?
[05:02:34] <jeffsmykil> How come I can set a hover event for a unchecked check-box but not a checked check-box
[05:03:02] <Flo0815> someone can help me?
[05:03:06] <Flo0815> hello
[05:03:11] <VernonK> nights: We've seen some changes here where I work with our user base and I got the forced update (along with a couple of guys on the team) within my Windows XP VM.
[05:03:26] <nights``> VernonK: interesting, was there really no option but to upgrade?
[05:03:28] <Flo0815> Cork?
[05:03:53] <VernonK> jeffsmkil: Just bind to the hover event and before firing anything check to see if the box is checked.
[05:04:01] <Cork> Flo0815: sure
[05:04:04] <rns> anyone know how I can turn this into a generic function where I just pass in parameter values instead of repeating this code block everytime? http://dpaste.com/725631/
[05:04:20] <VernonK> nights: Nope... Automatic updates installed and IE7 wouldn't even open.  Restart after update and there's IE8 ready to use.
[05:04:20] <jeffsmykil> VernonK: there is a dynamic amount of checkboxes
[05:04:35] <Flo0815> Cork: just like key: (function(){do sth.; }); ?
[05:04:36] <Cork> ?eval var obj = { v: (function() { return 10.10; })() }; obj
[05:04:38] <bot-t> Cork: {"v": 10.1}
[05:04:54] <Cork> bla...
[05:05:01] <Cork> ment to do 10+10 ;P
[05:05:04] <Flo0815> ^^
[05:05:18] <Flo0815> but i need to use eval?
[05:05:20] <nights``> VernonK: ok, but you were forced to press update? or some timer etc?
[05:05:27] <Cork> Flo0815: no, but you need the () at the end
[05:05:39] <Cork> (function() { })()
[05:05:48] <VernonK> nights: Nope, it's being included within automatic updates now so it's a seamless process for anybody that has that turned on.
[05:05:53] <Flo0815> ok
[05:06:01] <nights``> VernonK: does that mean there is no IE6 users anymore, except for those who didnt restart their computer for half a month? :) probably not...
[05:06:28] <Cork> and those that stay at win98 and things like that
[05:06:48] <VernonK> nights:  Haha... I wish.  Not a lot of folks are supporting IE6 anymore.  We try to basically make sure they can see the content.  In newer projects we're going to take a sort of 'print view' approach with IE6.
[05:07:06] <nights``> print view, hmm nice. is there any such tools?
[05:07:56] <Flo0815> Cork: thank you, again!
[05:07:58] <VernonK> nights: Well if you're source order is good, you can simply serve a stylesheet that you may reserve for print to IE6 with a conditional comment.  Don't know of any tools off the top of my head though.
[05:08:01] <Cork> np
[05:08:10] <nights``> VernonK: so how can people avoid getting updated? i dont get it. organizations with intentionally blocked updates etc?
[05:08:45] <nights``> VernonK: ok cool. well, yeah i might be able to extract code that loads up views etc. but its mixed with jquery here and there...
[05:08:49] <VernonK> nights:  Yep... Anybody that has automatic updates turned off won't get it.  Thing with organizations is the rollout may be slower but it should still be included in most cases as they push those updates out to corporate machines.
[05:09:42] <nights``> VernonK: well, when microsofts recommends an organization to get rid of the old stuff can they really afford to not follow those recommendations? most of the microsoft stuff is hackable without recommendations to upgrade :)
[05:10:22] <nights``> http://www.ie6nomore.com/
[05:10:25] <nights``> i like this
[05:10:28] <VernonK> nights:  Yep.  Not sure how spread it is but our IE7 traffic has fallen to below 10% right now.  Once it hits 5% or below we can start talking about scaling back support.
[05:10:39] <nights``> VernonK: nice.
[05:10:48] <nights``> what about IE6?
[05:10:57] <nights``> VernonK: fallen to 10% from where?
[05:11:47] <VernonK> nights:  Our IE6 traffic is right around 2-3%.  Very small base.  IE7 was in the high teens so it's been a nice trend.
[05:12:08] <nights``> VernonK: thats nice.
[05:12:16] <VernonK> nights:  Like the IE6 no more.  You've seen the countdown right? http://www.ie6countdown.com/
[05:12:20] <VernonK> nights: indeed
[05:12:56] <nights``> why sweden isnt on?
[05:13:02] <nights``> lol japan tops the list
[05:13:13] <nights``> ok, nevermind. china is good too ;)
[05:13:42] <VernonK> nights:  Yep... I wish I could find an article that I read recently about Japan slowly coming out of the IE6/7 dominance.
[05:14:06] <nights``> VernonK: Wow, that would be gold. A lot of our users are still IE6 unf :(
[05:14:17] <nights``> Got one organziation with 2k users to upgrade to IE8 :)
[05:14:22] <nights``> 2k employees even
[05:14:35] <VernonK> nights:  Yeah, that's no fun.  Nice! (about the IE8)
[05:16:13] <nights``> VernonK: yeah, its a feat im very proud of. might be able to get rid of another 15k employee IE6 user base soon. im sending yaritori with their windows admin right now.
[05:16:34] <nights``> its a large TV company btw
[05:16:57] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Sweden is far ahead when it comes to not use IE at all... And those who does uses IE8 or higher, due to it being standard on W7
[05:17:11] <VernonK> awesome!
[05:17:15] <nights``> yeah, I noticed. <1% since last may.
[05:17:18] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Sweden is big on using new tech, so we upgrade at least once every second year
[05:17:39] <nights``> Chris: ah, you are a fellow swede.
[05:17:45] <ChrisTheSorcerer> As soon as a new OS hits the market, every swedish computer is delivered with that one ;)
[05:17:53] <ChrisTheSorcerer> yup yup
[05:18:18] <ChrisTheSorcerer> GBG here ;)
[05:18:25] <nights``> good.
[05:18:30] <nights``> ;)
[05:18:40] <nights``> im stationed outside of the no-IE6 empire right now
[05:18:46] <nights``> but i would be proud to move back.
[05:20:07] <jeffsmykil> i dont understandf why mouseover works for unchecked checkboxes but not for checked ones
[05:21:07] <jeffsmykil> same with click
[05:22:27] <chaoflow> I'm in a contenteditable div, I click a button. How do I prevent the button from receiving focus, i.e. how do I keep my cursor at it's position in the contenteditable?
[05:22:31] <Xotix> How can i take the content of a div, put it intoanother temporary div and get .text() again? Somehow, i can wrap it into div with Jquery, doing this whole thing in one statement.
[05:23:24] <chaoflow> Xotix: $('<div/>').html($origdiv.html()).text()
[05:23:30] <Cork> Xotix: why do you need to get it into another div to do .text() ?
[05:23:53] <Xotix> Ah  now i know what i've thought wrong. Cork, to clean it up.
[05:24:24] <Cork> Xotix: and you can't do that by doing org_div.text() ?
[05:25:26] <Cork> Xotix: something like $orgdiv.clone() should give you a new div with the same content
[05:25:47] <Cork> with much less dom work then .html does
[05:26:04] <Xotix> Cork thanks, i don't know for sure yet, I'm experimenting but it looked like it doesn't. Maybe with a little break it'll.
[05:27:12] <VictorCL> hi
[05:27:25] <VictorCL> what's the difference of this   (function(){})(jQuery);   with this  $(function(){ });
[05:27:56] <Cork> VictorCL: the first is a none complet scope and the second is a dom event callback
[05:28:16] <Cork> (function($){})(jQuery); encures you that $ is jQuery inside that function
[05:29:01] <Cork> it doesn't way for any events or anything, it executes immediately
[05:29:02] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: you have a second>
[05:29:04] <nights``> http://www.ie6countdown.com/ displays well with IE6
[05:29:05] <nights``> :)
[05:29:12] <nights``> almost better if it breaks
[05:29:14] <nights``> so people get it
[05:29:26] <Cork> VictorCL: the second is a short hand for $(document).ready(function() {});
[05:30:26] <VictorCL> ok cool , thankz Cork  , I guess I use the first on when I have more than 1 javascript framework like mootools or other
[05:30:54] <Cork> VictorCL: you should _always_ use it if your writing a plugin
[05:31:02] <Cork> but ya, for normal code its rarly needed
[05:31:12] <VictorCL> in the latter , if I set a variable  ,, it will not be visible from the outside?
[05:31:28] <Cork> all js functions does that
[05:32:00] <VernonK> VictorCL: The latter is just a shortcut to $(document).ready(function() {}); whereas the first is used for the purpose of creating a closure.
[05:32:03] <VernonK> Cork:  Would you agree?
[05:32:21] <Cork> the first is a bit more then that
[05:32:23] <Cork> but ya bascially
[05:32:42] <Cork> the first makes a safe harbur for jquery code
[05:33:05] <VictorCL> I have to read more about closures
[05:33:08] <Cork> actually the second one can do it too
[05:33:19] <Cork> jQuery(function($) {});
[05:33:31] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: if you get a chance I was wondering why this: http://pastebin.com/9m7wNVSS only works with checkboxes that are un-checked
[05:33:34] <VernonK> Yeah, that's true.
[05:33:37] <Cork> would do the same except it waits for the load event
[05:34:34] <Cork> ?p @ jeffsmykil
[05:34:34] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[05:34:58] <Cork> or to specify it a bit better
[05:35:03] <Cork> ?demo @ jeffsmykil
[05:35:03] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:35:14] <jeffsmykil> it's a snippet, and kind of self explanitory
[05:35:32] <shabble> so, many optimisation guides suggest putting all scripts (inc jquery) at the end of the body tag to let everythign else load first, but then $() isn't defined early enough.
[05:35:34] <Cork> dead code is rarly self explainatory
[05:35:52] <jeffsmykil> Did you look at it and read the question?
[05:36:01] <shabble> is there some sort of shim or workaround? It seems like an obvious problem but I can't find anything in the docs/searching
[05:36:08] <VictorCL> thanks Cronoh
[05:36:09] <VictorCL> I mean
[05:36:13] <VictorCL> Cork
[05:36:20] <Cork> jeffsmykil: else i wouldn't have asked for a demo
[05:36:24] <shabble> say, define $() to queue all calls until juqery is loaded or soething.
[05:37:27] <Cork> shabble: if you put it at the bottom, scripts still need to load after jquery
[05:39:28] <shabble> Cork: external scripst are fine, but this app has a bunch of inline <script> chunks that'll be a pain to move
[05:39:50] <quicksilver> yes, you must put jQ before any inline <script> that uses it
[05:39:56] <quicksilver> that is fairly obvious I think :)
[05:39:59] <Cork> shabble: then you need to load jquery before the browser gets to them
[05:40:09] <quicksilver> you could consider using mod_pagespeed or somethign similar
[05:40:16] <Xotix> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/nK4eJ/ this was what I was trying to do. Now i need to not save the whole content like i do at the moment (oldContent) but get the text before my cursor and after my cursor.  And then put it together again. Any good, guide, instruction on that?
[05:40:16] <Cork> shabble: in other words, you can't have jquery in body
[05:40:18] <quicksilver> which munges your pages so you don't have to.
[05:41:04] <Cork> Xotix: ok, so your filtering out html?
[05:41:09] <shabble> Cork: ok. So a temporary $() (which is the only jquery entry point they use afaict) function that defers to jquery when loaded wouldn't work?
[05:41:16] <shabble> I just wondered if it was a solved problem
[05:41:29] <shabble> I'll just leave it in the header/early body otherwise
[05:41:36] <Cork> shabble: the scripts that depends on jquery needs it loaded when they run :)
[05:41:44] <Xotix> Cork yes, contenteditable div's create a lot of nasty spans with not wanted formatting. :)
[05:42:08] <shabble> quicksilver: hmm, pagespeed looks interesting, thanks.
[05:42:26] <Xotix> Maybe it's event better, saving the cursors position, put the old text back again. and restore the cursor and then paste it there.
[05:42:29] <Cork> Xotix: i think we've talked about this before
[05:42:42] <Cork> Xotix: you would have to create selections
[05:43:03] <Cork> Xotix: if thats not enough, no you can't
[05:43:11] <Xotix> Cork, yes. But i never got it solved.
[05:44:16] <Xotix> saving the cursors position shouldn't be very hard, right? So i can restore oldContent, restore my cursor and use my existing code for pasting.
[05:45:12] <Cork> Xotix: moving the cursor and fiddeling with the users copy buffer is intentionally really hard
[05:45:49] <Cork> Xotix: cause its historically been used for many intrusions into the user privacy
[05:46:08] <Cork> (reading users passwords, replace the content with adds ...)
[05:46:23] <Cork> moving the curstor and harras the user
[05:46:37] <Cork> it was quite a big problem late 90's
[05:47:04] <Innocentus> hi
[05:47:27] <Innocentus> Does image preloading with JQuery works with all common browsers and also IE6?
[05:47:38] <Cork> Innocentus: yes
[05:48:00] <Cork> Innocentus: at least if your doing it in the correct way
[05:48:07] <Cork> Innocentus: your using a plugin or something?
[05:48:49] <Xotix> Cork, I'm not accessing the user's clipboard
[05:49:16] <mlechner> hi, anybody knows a slideahow plugin making it possible to run a slideshow within a jquery.ui.dialog window?
[05:52:25] <arphen> i'm trying to install jquery ui mlechner
[05:52:34] <arphen> where do i put which files
[05:52:45] <arphen> it's all incredibly confusing since there are no installation instructions
[05:52:53] <alice_> I have added a youtube play icon on image. Now image is fade out. I don't want to show the fade image. Will you please help me ?  thanks alot. here is jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Gf7Tp/
[05:52:57] <lenswipe> hey guys
[05:54:28] <alice_> I just want to show the original image with icon.
[05:54:33] <Innocentus> Cork: I would like to use a plugin
[05:54:41] <shabble> Cork: aha, http://samsaffron.com/archive/2012/02/17/stop-paying-your-jquery-tax (near bottom of article) is basically what i was thinking
[05:54:53] <shabble> but as it/you mention, making sur everything else is loaded as well is going to be tricky
[05:55:03] <Innocentus> Cork: And I also would like to check if it is loaded - f.ex. by plugin property isDownloaded?
[05:55:46] <ss23> Hi, it looks like the .change attribute is only fired when an element has focus (according to http://api.jquery.com/change/, but I've found similiar results). is there an alternative for when a value is updated regardless of how it was done? In my case, I'm updating it via jQuery itself (input.val(foo))
[05:55:47] <Cork> Innocentus: thats done by listning for events
[05:56:00] <Cork> Innocentus: from when you preload the image(s)
[05:57:00] <Innocentus> Cork: What event exactly? I heard that load event is not reliable enough :/
[05:57:54] <Cork> Innocentus: var images = 0; var i = new Image(); i.onload = function() { images++; }; i.src = url;
[05:58:23] <Innocentus> Cork: and JQuery doesn't provide facilities of its own?
[05:58:39] <Cork> Innocentus: there are surely a plugin for it
[05:58:47] <Cork> Innocentus: but no its not build in
[05:59:05] <Innocentus> Cork: I would like to know which one would be the best / most solid?
[05:59:05] <Xotix> if i do console.log(x); and thsi gives me some obj why do i get undefined when typing x withi nthe console? or window.x?
[05:59:07] <Cork> Innocentus: though as you can see its farly easy to do with plain js, so not really a need
[05:59:27] <quicksilver> Xotix: presumably x is a local variable of the place you have "console.log" then?
[06:00:00] <Xotix> quicksilver, the var is rangy and there is no other rangy. http://jsfiddle.net/nK4eJ/1/
[06:00:50] <xec_> Xotix: you have selected "onLoad" in the left hand menu
[06:01:09] <xec_> Xotix: meaning the js will be wrapped in a function
[06:01:20] <Cork> Innocentus: haven't really used any of them so can't give any sugestions
[06:01:34] <Cork> Innocentus: give them a try and see :)
[06:01:41] <Xotix> xec_ so?
[06:01:58] <Innocentus> Cork: The only reason for a plugin would it be to check if an element has been downloaded - something like element.isDownloaded
[06:02:03] <xec_> Xotix: when is rangy defined?
[06:02:14] <Xotix> rangy core.js window.rangy=function()  so when i type window.rangy into my console. shouldn't i get its object?
[06:02:17] <Innocentus> Cork: the loaded-event handler has to assign this boolean to element - but a plugin would be better?
[06:02:19] <Xotix> check out resources
[06:02:46] <Cork> Innocentus: not an element
[06:02:49] <xec_> oh i see. try the built in firebug lite console http://jsfiddle.net/nK4eJ/3/
[06:03:03] <Cork> Innocentus: it would take a list of urls to preload, and you could ex. get an event when they'r all loaded
[06:03:09] <Innocentus> Cork: sounds nice
[06:03:22] <xec_> Xotix: or http://jsfiddle.net/nK4eJ/2/show/ without a frame
[06:03:37] <Xotix> xec_ ah ok thanks
[06:03:46] <Xotix> :)
[06:05:54] <DarsVaeda> anyone using jTemplates? how do I handle null values?
[06:06:28] <ss23> Hi, it looks like the .change attribute is only fired when an element has focus (according to http://api.jquery.com/change/, but I've found similiar results). is there an alternative for when a value is updated regardless of how it was done? In my case, I'm updating it via jQuery itself (input.val(foo))
[06:07:16] <quicksilver> xec_: sorry, where is that built-in firebug lite of which you speak?
[06:07:20] <mlechner> arphen, just open a page using jquery and jquery ui and have a look at the source
[06:07:34] <quicksilver> xec_: I've often wondered how to get access to the right javascript contexts in jsfiddles and never worked it out ;)
[06:07:38] <xec_> quicksilver: there's a checkbox if you select jQuery edge
[06:08:35] <quicksilver> xec_: oh. Why only with edge?
[06:08:44] <xec_> no idea
[06:09:10] <quicksilver> xec_: very handy, thank you.
[06:09:16] <xec_> yw :)
[06:18:27] <midori-rus> Hello. how to add a class to the fourtheighth twelfth etc. elements ? its possible?
[06:19:19] <dabear> ?eq @ midori-rus
[06:19:20] <bot-t> midori-rus, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[06:19:50] <MacroMan> I'm capturing right click to show a custom context menu, but e.preventDefault(); isn't suppressing the original menu: http://pastebin.com/wviJg1u7
[06:20:09] <rroelofs> midori-rus: otherwise nth-child
[06:21:35] <dabear> MacroMan: use the contextmenu event instead
[06:21:48] <MacroMan> There's a contextmenu event?
[06:22:06] <dabear> there is
[06:22:29] <dabear> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.oncontextmenu
[06:22:34] <MacroMan> Why can't I find it in the jquery docs?
[06:22:43] <MacroMan> ah ok. Tnaks
[06:23:07] <dabear> MacroMan: is isn't a jquery specific event
[06:23:11] <nFFF> Why jquerystyle.com down, anyone know? any similiar sites?
[06:23:41] <dabear> gotta do $(...).bind("contextmenu", ...)
[06:24:13] <MacroMan> dabear: Works great. Thanks
[06:30:44] <Xotix> Cork i got it http://jsfiddle.net/nK4eJ/5/ it blinks, but i don't care.
[06:31:20] <Xotix> Is there a site which shows in a table which event is supported by which browser and get's triggered by x?
[06:33:41] <fhil> Recommend any lightweight async with jQuery? There is https://github.com/caolan/async, RxJS (etc) or jQuery.deferred?
[06:34:36] <fhil> Not for async loading but SVG/paint event queue.
[06:34:40] <Entroacceptor> ha :)
[06:34:56] <quicksilver> Xotix: http://quirksmode.org/dom/events/
[06:35:04] <quicksilver> Xotix: depending what you wanted exactly.
[06:35:09] <quicksilver> it's a useful site anyway.
[06:35:10] <Xotix> quicksilver: thanks
[06:35:21] <Entroacceptor> I'm using the validator, and I have a field which validation depends on the status of another field
[06:35:40] <Entroacceptor> how would I do that the smart way?
[06:40:48] <fRAiLtY-> http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/8/ Hi guys, trying to get the row/col to highlight on select, so when a6 is selected it selects the row up to a6, then when the size is selected it works down and does the col too, I've got stuck though :x see here for an example, http://www.solopress.com/flyers/flyer-printing.html select a size and quantity to see what I mean
[06:40:48] <fRAiLtY-> ]
[06:45:41] <VictorCL> fRAiLtY-,  what are you stuck in?
[06:45:56] <fRAiLtY-> VictorCL: How to actually make it highlight, the syntax etx
[06:46:14] <fRAiLtY-> and the logic of telling it to do "up to" A6 for example
[06:48:13] <Xotix> http://jsfiddle.net/nK4eJ/5/ this works in chrome, firefox. In Safari 5.1 it doesn't. Basically, I'm emptying the div and save its old value. then only the paste remains in the div. after that, I'm putting them back together. But in Safari, it somehow breaks after getting the old content. Why? And idea?
[06:48:42] <bobbytek> Is there something I can use as a poor man's YFT?
[06:49:00] <bobbytek> I don't want to have to include the color plugin on my page
[06:49:19] <bobbytek> But I would like something like it, perhaps an opacity fade or something for a form element
[06:49:39] <dabear> fRAiLtY-: $(this).prevAll().andSelf().css("background", "red") selects all previous columns in that row
[06:49:52] <Germanaz0> hi all
[06:50:08] <dabear> Germanaz0: hi
[06:50:21] <Germanaz0> everything ok ?
[06:50:28] <dabear> nah
[06:50:45] <dabear> should it be?
[06:51:06] <fRAiLtY-> dabear: Thanks, how do I integrate that, http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/11/
[06:51:22] <dabear> lol
[06:51:24] <dabear> nah
[06:51:30] <dabear> im not doing it for you
[06:52:54] <dabear> and if you're doing it in the change handler, you gotta select the first element and not $(this)
[06:53:21] <fRAiLtY-> So get the first option in the drop-down?
[06:59:35] <midori-rus> rroelofs thx, its works for me
[06:59:45] <nights``> cork: This website is dedicated to watching Internet Explorer 6 usage drop to less than 1% worldwide, so more websites can choose to drop support for Internet Explorer 6, saving hours of work for web developers.
[07:00:14] <nights``> i would like to underline the last "saving hours of work for web developers." there.
[07:16:38] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I think it might be time for web developers to stand up, and demand that browser developers make the BROWSERS more user friendly instead. Something as easy as "activate javascript" becomes a hassle, and therefore the industry puts that on the thousands of web developers instead of the few hundreds of browser developers
[07:17:11] <ChrisTheSorcerer> and the benefits of upgrading the browser becomes nullified when the web developer is forced to support older browsers
[07:23:27] <marcogmonteiro> what am I doing wring here: http://pastebin.com/r3GeQzAf
[07:23:42] <marcogmonteiro> I'm getting this error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[07:24:31] <ChrisTheSorcerer> What is the expected result?
[07:25:03] <dabear> marcogmonteiro: give us the js code, without the embedded php
[07:25:35] <marcogmonteiro> the embed php is just do define the url and that is correct...
[07:27:37] <ChrisTheSorcerer> try this: http://pastebin.com/x6MjhUUU
[07:30:12] <Xotix> Does IE not allow formatting in an contenteExitable div?
[07:30:54] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I believe the latest one does, but IE8 and earlier doesn't.
[07:32:15] <Xotix> IE9 does support it? Why, who the heck needs it. (From the paste). Should be an option. But thanks!
[07:34:00] <asher^^> is there any jquery ui (or similar) code for a combination of text input+dropdown?
[07:34:26] <mlechner> hi, anybody knows a slideahow plugin making it possible to run a slideshow within a jquery.ui.dialog window?
[07:35:36] <mr_kamus> hola
[07:37:52] <zatan> hi can anyone hlpe me with a href link BROWSER , http://jsfiddle.net/NDVdf/ ?
[07:38:04] <zatan> its should be opening google, but its not
[07:39:06] <ChrisTheSorcerer> What are you trying to do wiht this? I'm getting a "load file" dialog when I click the text box...
[07:40:07] <zatan> ChrisTheSorcerer, I want to open popup window when you press "browse"
[07:41:44] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Well, right now you're pointing the href to void(0), so you are basically telling the link to go to a black hole in the code....
[07:44:06] <ChrisTheSorcerer> and you are using the same quotation marks over and over... onclick="window.open("google.co.uk")"> will be read as "onclick=" and "window.open(" and "google.co.uk" and ")" separately.
[07:44:43] <ChrisTheSorcerer> google.co.uk will be read as outside the onclick, a function you want to call on from outside the onclick-function
[07:47:10] <ChrisTheSorcerer> zatan, this is basically what you have written there: http://jsfiddle.net/NDVdf/8/
[07:48:21] <mik__> Hi, can't return private variable with $.extend funtion... pls help.. http://jsfiddle.net/mikaroid/wKeQY/8/
[07:50:38] <zatan> ChrisTheSorcerer, thank $(this).after("<a href='#' onclick='window.open('google.co.uk')'> sololo </a>");   I am doing something wrong with this line
[07:51:07] <supermanjnk> What is best practice for binding events to links that were loaded VIA ajax. should I do it in the complete function, or on the page that is being loaded via ajax?
[07:53:29] <ChrisTheSorcerer> zatan: $(this).after means you're appending the following string to the document. Since you don't have any dynamic content, but static html-code, you might as well write it out directly on the page. I'm not sure what you're trying to do, but what you do right now is to write out a link to Google after the text box
[07:53:59] <mik__> Hi, can't return private variable with $.extend funtion... pls help.. http://jsfiddle.net/mikaroid/wKeQY/8/
[07:54:23] <zatan> ChrisTheSorcerer, all fine $(this).after("<a href='#' onclick=window.open('google.co.uk','width=300','height=100')> sololo </a>");   it was some issues with   '"'"' opostrophes
[07:56:27] <davidw> when I click the 'magnify web page' thing in the bottom right of IE8, any ideas what events it might generate?
[07:57:12] <timing> I think none, but it might fire a window.resize ?
[08:00:10] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I dont' think it actually resizes, I only think it magnifies, like when you hold ctrl and scroll with the mouse wheel
[08:00:48] <ChrisTheSorcerer> it decreases the number of pixels per inch, instead of increases number of pixels and keep the ratio
[08:01:33] <kevindougans> can anyone help me figure out a bug in ie9 i'm having? I'm on a mac and using parallels to run ie9 and its a pain in the neck. http://test.cafemamboibiza.com/en on the right hand side beside the paris hilton video theres a 360 tour that works fine in chrome, firefox etc but not i.e. 9 and i've installed some developer bar and its telling me theres a bug in the query file but i've redownloaded the query and still no joy
[08:01:44] <davidw> I've got this weird thing where it won't display an image in a canvas, then I click that and the image shows up
[08:02:18] <ChrisTheSorcerer> davidw: Do you have an image.onload-event triggering the image rendering?
[08:05:05] <ChrisTheSorcerer> davidw: Something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/536mp/
[08:11:58] <davidw> ChrisTheSorcerer, that page doesn't load with IE8 due to the lack of excanvas.js.....
[08:17:11] <ChrisTheSorcerer> >.< yeah, IE8 sucks big time. Hardly any support for HTML5 at all. If you're gonna have support for IE8, you might want to use something else.
[08:18:23] <davidw> well, it's just a canvas with a zoomable image.... the crazy thing is this:
[08:19:19] <davidw> http://jsfiddle.net/8bYBq/
[08:19:45] <davidw> the -'ed out lines make the f'er work in IE8, but switching to Jquery makes it fail
[08:20:03] <davidw> whereas of course everything else, IE9 included, works fine with the jquery
[08:20:10] <EugenA> i'm trying to integrage jquery file upload project in drupal 7. I'm getting these errors: http://picpaste.de/pics/debug-XhzzUOZV.1333380000.png
[08:21:23] <EugenA> i'm tried to replace $ with jQuery, but still many errors
[08:24:03] <quicksilver> davidw: well there are some odd things about both parts of your code.
[08:24:28] <quicksilver> davidw: "document.getElementById(this.id);" is just "this"
[08:24:37] <davidw> quicksilver, it's inherited
[08:24:40] <quicksilver> davidw: $('#' + this.id) is just "$(this)"
[08:24:43] <davidw> err, I mean the code is
[08:24:55] <quicksilver> but jquery works fine in IE8, for sure.
[08:25:29] <quicksilver> the two important differences are the "px" and the use of "style.height" instead of attr('height')
[08:25:42] <quicksilver> I don't know which one is actually making the difference without testing.
[08:26:52] <shoky> those 2 things aren't necessarily 'this'..
[08:27:39] <quicksilver> true enough, maybe 'this' isn't a DOM object
[08:27:44] <shoky> aye
[08:27:52] <quicksilver> in which case, a little more context is required to understand that code.
[08:28:02] <shoky> context is always good ;)
[08:35:34] <hlveheart> hey duders. how would one set a var on a specific input radio that doesn't have a class or id assigned to it?
[08:35:34] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/XmbnE/4/
[08:35:43] <hlveheart> i don't know how else to word that
[08:37:19] <VictorCL> hlveheart,  they all have the same name
[08:37:27] <VictorCL> how will you distinguish them=
[08:38:06] <hlveheart> that's what I'm trying to do, set different variables to each
[08:38:47] <VictorCL> change their name
[08:38:57] <NoiseEee> hlveheart: well, each one is a radio input that's a child of the form, right?
[08:39:02] <NoiseEee> hlveheart: <hint>
[08:39:26] <hlveheart> The actual code is in ASPX, pretend name isn't even there.
[08:39:45] <asterisk-Tester> Hello, is there a way to use bulk special characters in .match() regular expressions with jquery ? var expCount = $('#myStr').val().match(/\{/g); //this works ok but : var expCount = $('#myStr').val().match(/^[\{\}]/g);  doesnt work
[08:40:15] <VictorCL> you can do $("form.list").find("input").eq(2)
[08:40:32] <asterisk-Tester> I dont want to pass it ranges like : var lnhRegex = /([A-Za-z0-9-]+)/gm; jsut specific special char
[08:40:47] <hlveheart> Hmm
[08:41:13] <NoiseEee> hlveheart: http://jsfiddle.net/XmbnE/5/
[08:45:54] <shoky> asterisk-Tester,  /^[\{\}]/g   seems fine
[08:46:00] <shoky> what are you trying to match
[08:46:35] <asterisk-Tester> i want to look for { and } in a string, it doesnt work currently...
[08:46:48] <shoky> it looks for them only at the beginning of the string
[08:46:51] <shoky> because of the ^
[08:46:57] <asterisk-Tester> Ah ?
[08:47:06] <shoky> why did you add the ^ ?
[08:48:13] <asterisk-Tester> I currently have this in my code and it works on all user characters not just the first one : $('#user').val().match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9\s]+$/)
[08:48:26] <shoky> so?
[08:48:34] <shoky> that's because of the +
[08:48:53] <shoky> copy-pasting without understanding is evil
[08:48:56] <lenswipe> hey gusy
[08:48:57] <lenswipe> guys*
[08:49:03] <shoky> hy
[08:50:03] <shoky> asterisk-Tester just remove the ^ ...
[08:50:31] <asterisk-Tester> shoky: thx it seems to be working.... what does the + do at the end ?
[08:50:51] <shoky> matches one or more occurences of the previous character
[08:50:54] <Phrogz> asterisk-Tester: + in a regex means "one or more of the previous"
[08:51:27] <shoky> or character-set
[08:51:36] <Phrogz>  /foo+/   matches  "foooooo" but not "fo";   /(foo)+/  matches "foofoofoofoo"
[08:52:28] <asterisk-Tester> Thx for the clarification
[08:55:08] <kevindougans> i hate internet explorer with a passion
[08:55:56] <shoky> 9 is almost okay
[08:56:00] <shoky> haven't tried 10
[08:57:48] <Eviltwin> I'm not sure I'm ready to call of them almost okay

[09:03:35] <DukeDrake> ok
[09:03:43] <Eviltwin> After the data is first loaded, it doesn't update the attributes afterward
[09:03:45] <Eviltwin> Or read from them
[09:03:54] <DukeDrake> huh?
[09:03:55] <Eviltwin> The DOM is not designed for active storage of data
[09:03:59] <Eviltwin> see ?data
[09:04:00] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[09:04:03] <Eviltwin> It's explained on that page
[09:04:08] <DukeDrake> ok
[09:04:57] <Eviltwin> $("<div>").attr("value", "foo").data("value") yields "foo"
[09:05:18] <kevindougans> whats the best debugging firebug like tool for IE??? I'm on a mac and use parallels and can't get firebug lite working and i've got some major query problems
[09:05:21] <Eviltwin> Err
[09:05:46] <Eviltwin> $("<div>").attr("data-value", "foo").data("value") yields "foo"
[09:06:08] <Eviltwin> But $("<div>").data("value", "foo").attr("data-value") yields undefined
[09:06:25] <Fusselkroete> hi all
[09:06:32] <Eviltwin> And $("<div>").data("value", "bar").attr("data-value", "bar").data("value") yields "bar"
[09:07:03] <Eviltwin> It loads the data-* attributes into .data's internal storage the first time you call .data on the element
[09:07:10] <Eviltwin> And from then on it uses the internal storage
[09:07:42] <Phrogz> Fusselkroete: Hi! http://jsfiddle.net/2LBsq/1/ :)
[09:07:53] <Fusselkroete> if i update the attribut selected from the <option> element with selected=selected than JQuery wont update selectedIndex from parent element <select>. What i can do? i tryed to set it with attr manualy but didnt worked :/
[09:08:03] <Fusselkroete> thx
[09:08:21] <Fusselkroete> i tryed with prop too btw :/
[09:08:32] <Phrogz> Fusselkroete: That test page works for me. Not for you
[09:08:33] <Phrogz> ?
[09:08:34] <Fusselkroete> smthing else must be wrong :/
[09:08:45] <Fusselkroete> it works perfectly
[09:08:51] <Phrogz> Also, I suspect that your most recent statement about selectedIndex "not being updated" is not true.
[09:09:36] * Phrogz makes another test case.
[09:11:56] <Phrogz> Fusselkroete: http://jsfiddle.net/2LBsq/3/
[09:13:00] <Fusselkroete> hmmm
[09:13:12] <Fusselkroete> your way works
[09:13:34] <Fusselkroete> but not in my code.. i use variables for selector
[09:13:37] <Fusselkroete> maybe there is the problem
[09:13:44] <Phrogz> Make a pared-down test case and show us :)
[09:15:21] <Fusselkroete> ok thanks to you :>
[09:15:25] <Fusselkroete> ur my hero of the day
[09:15:35] <Fusselkroete> but it seems it becomes overwritten by something else :)
[09:16:08] <Fusselkroete> <Fusselkroete> ok thanks to you :>
[09:16:13] <Fusselkroete> <Fusselkroete> ur my hero of the day
[09:16:18] <Fusselkroete> <Fusselkroete> but it seems it becomes overwritten by something else :)
[09:16:40] <Eviltwin> Why did you just repeat that?
[09:17:03] <Phrogz_> I suppose because I went LD and then rejoined?
[09:18:08] <bambams> docs.jquery.com is apparently down. >_>
[09:19:47] <Fusselkroete> ur hyperactive?
[09:27:07] <mo0nykit> What CSS property does jQuery manipulate when doing a slideUp or slideDown? I'm trying to duplicate the effect using d3js transitions.
[09:27:10] <DukeDrake> Eviltwin: hah! Thanx! =D
[09:27:23] <VictorCL> why is chrome console not showing ajax calls U.u ?
[09:27:30] <VictorCL> anyone has this issue?
[09:28:15] <Eviltwin> VictorCL: Either you're looking in the wrong place or they're not actually happening
[09:28:32] <Eviltwin> Or yu weren't running the Developer Tools when they were made so it didn't record them
[09:28:35] <VictorCL> yes , on firebug I can see them
[09:30:16] <andrew9183> you should click Net
[09:30:30] <Jayflux> Whats the point of $.callbacks in a real-world scenario?
[09:31:59] <pixelhandler1> Jayflux $.Callbacks is used under the hood for $.Deferred, $.ajax returns a (deferred) promise object so $.Callbacks is very useful for managing async behaviors in addition to ajax calls.
[09:32:02] <timing> I rather use $.nickelback
[09:32:15] <NoiseEee> pretty sure that takes your browser back to 1998
[09:33:04] <Jayflux> $.nickelback('you remind me', TRUE);
[09:36:18] <Fusselkroete> <Phrogz> Make a pared-down test case and show us :)
[09:36:19] <Fusselkroete> ?
[09:38:28] <Phrogz> Fusselkroete: You do not know what that sentence means?
[09:39:30] <Fusselkroete> yup
[09:39:31] <Phrogz> Delete irrelevant HTML, CSS, and JS. Keep "paring down" your code as long as the problem exists. If you can delete some HTML, CSS, or JS without removing your bug, you still have work to do.
[09:39:53] <Fusselkroete> aye
[09:40:09] <Phrogz> If you delete some irrelevant-seeming code and the problem goes away, think about how it could be related, and put it back in, and find something else to delete.
[09:40:41] <Phrogz> If you never have an "ah-HA!" moment where you realize what you're doing wrong, at the end you will have a very simple bit of code you can show us, and we can give you the ahHA!
[09:41:42] <Fusselkroete> too much code ;)
[09:41:53] <Fusselkroete> i will do that soon but first some small tests :o
[09:46:27] <supermanjnk> how would I do the following: $(window).bind('applyLinks', function() {
[09:46:29] <supermanjnk> but using on instead
[09:48:32] <DukeDrake> hm
[09:48:41] <subdesign> hi
[09:49:12] <DukeDrake> is it possible to use the "Attribute Contains Selector" (*=) case insensitive?
[09:49:44] <subdesign> ppl i have an ajax-php cart, and when I want to delete one product from the cart with ajax, first page reloads, and with second click product is deleted trough ajax
[09:50:15] <subdesign> I use e.preventDefault() beginning of the function
[09:50:23] <lduros> trying to use .delay() with animate(). here is what I have: elem.stop().delay(2000).animate({}); -- for some reason it doesn't seem to wait the delay
[09:50:29] <lduros> before doing the animation
[09:50:58] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jqueryui: We're still looking for proposals for the SF jQuery Conference in June. Built something awesome with UI? Talk about it: http://t.co/m87HGQ0l ★ http://bit.ly/HffcQK
[09:52:39] <Fusselkroete> Phrogz it seems that its because the object is visiblity:hidden... and it only do what it should after second accessing
[09:53:01] <Fusselkroete> even if i directly access it over name selector
[09:57:12] <Fusselkroete> or display none
[09:59:34] <subdesign> guyz if I use preventDefault for an achor, why the php part runs , and why only runs ajax at second click ?
[10:00:47] <brownthomas> So Im trying to print a page at a particular URL by loading it into an off-screen iframe and invoking print() when the iframe fires the load event. http://pastie.org/3715513. Does that code look broken, because in Chrome its printing a blank page and in Safari it prints a blank page, then when you cancel that it prints the correct page!
[10:08:21] <NoiseEee> subdesign: pastebin.
[10:08:30] <subdesign> ok
[10:10:04] <subdesign> NoiseEee, http://hastebin.com/koyoqusiha.coffee
[10:10:34] <subdesign> i just implemented livequery but the same...
[10:11:03] <NoiseEee> subdesign: preventDefault() only stops the event.  your code continues to run.
[10:11:23] <subdesign> http://hastebin.com/sokofiwabe.coffee
[10:11:28] <subdesign> hm
[10:11:33] <djQuery> subdesign see ?.on
[10:11:34] <bot-t> djQuery, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:12:20] <subdesign> so you suggest to try .on ?
[10:12:23] <NoiseEee> subdesign: also, having URLS that delete from your DB just based on an ID is a great way to let people delete things willy nilly
[10:12:31] <NoiseEee> subdesign: i have no idea what your goal is
[10:13:01] <subdesign> It deletes only from the cart, and this md5 code is one-time code
[10:13:16] <djQuery> subdesign, I believe that livequery had some performance issues and not sure if it is still being developed
[10:13:24] <NoiseEee> why were you using preventDefault() in the first place, for what purpose?
[10:13:42] <subdesign> djQuery : yes i know i just tried but i'll delete soon
[10:13:48] <djQuery> subdesign, las comit was 2 years ago
[10:14:12] <subdesign> NoiseEee, my goal is to delete a product from the user's cart with ajax
[10:14:18] <subdesign> it works but
[10:14:20] <blendedbychris> is $('[name="visitor_type"]').val() the proper way to get the value of a radio
[10:14:22] <blendedbychris> ?
[10:14:23] <subdesign> only for the second click
[10:14:52] <NoiseEee> subdesign: preventDefault() belongs nowhere in your code, assuming you aren't using a <a> tag to delete something (which is terrible semantics)
[10:14:58] <djQuery> blendedbychris, got code
[10:15:19] <NoiseEee> blendedbychris: yes, .val() is the proper way to get the value of a form element
[10:16:00] <subdesign> ok NoiseEee , what you suggest?
[10:16:23] <NoiseEee> use <button>s for actions
[10:16:34] <blendedbychris> djQuery: http://app.fellowshipchurch.com/html/contact-us/prayer
[10:16:34] <subdesign> ok!
[10:16:47] <blendedbychris> $('[name="visitor_type"]').val() doesn't work for some reason
[10:17:18] <shoky> anybody know knockoutjs and can help me figure out why this behaves differently under IE8 than on IE9/chrome?   http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/7CGB6/
[10:17:34] <NoiseEee> subdesign: as far as why its only working on the second click, try http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[10:17:43] <danzik17> Are the getData/setData events still marked for removal/deprecation?  Can't find docs on them anywhere on the site
[10:17:53] <djQuery> blendedbychris, what is the length of  $('[name="visitor_type"]')
[10:18:04] <blendedbychris> djinni: 3
[10:18:16] <djQuery>   $('[name="visitor_type"]:selected')
[10:18:30] <djQuery> ?selected@blendedbychris
[10:18:31] <bot-t> blendedbychris, :selected: Selects all elements that are selected. http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[10:18:31] <blendedbychris> it returns the 3
[10:20:58] <csurap> are there any cross browser testing tools for sites on "localhost" ?
[10:21:51] <blendedbychris> djQuery: well… that doesn't return anything :(
[10:21:58] <blendedbychris> should it be :checked maybe?
[10:22:04] <patrickgamer> csurap: you mean like unit testing? if so check out http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit
[10:22:31] <blendedbychris> djQuery: can you take a look at that link?
[10:25:50] <subdesign> NoiseEee, THX mate, with button works
[10:25:59] <NoiseEee> np subdesign good luck
[10:26:07] <subdesign> and changed preventDefault to return false
[10:26:54] <subdesign> again, thx , bye
[10:27:11] <dmsuperman> Is there perhaps a plugin that might use the selector engine in order to _create_ elements? so $('div.herp span#derp') would be the same as $('<div class="herp"><span id="derp"></span></div>')
[10:27:12] <djQuery> return false would be worse
[10:27:53] <djQuery> you mean like a coffee script for jquery
[10:28:25] <djQuery> dmsuperman, ^^^
[10:28:37] <dmsuperman> Well I mean pretty much what I said :P
[10:28:41] <dmsuperman> if that is what I said then yes?
[10:28:42] <djQuery> there are plenty of template plugins out there
[10:28:55] <dmsuperman> I want to use the exact jquery selector syntax
[10:28:56] <djQuery> not that I know of
[10:29:01] <dmsuperman> to plug and play between the two
[10:29:03] <dmsuperman> with the same selector
[10:29:40] <nFFF> dmsuperman, you could write your own :>
[10:30:05] <dmsuperman> I could. Or I could see if somebody has already written one and save myself lots of time
[10:30:12] <dmsuperman> Hence my joining teh channel and asking if one already exists :)
[10:30:18] <djQuery> dmsuperman, or just suck it up and use anyone of the hundreds of template engines out there my favorite is see ?knockout.js
[10:30:19] <bot-t> dmsuperman, UI/API/1.8/Progressbar - The progress bar is designed to simply display the current % complete for a process. The bar is coded to be flexibly sized through CSS and will scale to fit inside it's parent container by default. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Progressbar
[10:30:35] <dmsuperman> djQuery: that doesn't help me. I want to use the same selectors for _both_ selection and creation
[10:30:41] <dmsuperman> this is for a large project and it'll save lots of dev time
[10:30:44] <djQuery> dmsuperman, http://knockoutjs.com/
[10:31:03] <dmsuperman> this is not at all what I'm asking for
[10:31:14] <dmsuperman> all I want to do is create DOM elements using jquery syntax :-/
[10:31:19] <djQuery> dmsuperman, sorry man got nothin for you
[10:31:27] <dmsuperman> thanks
[10:31:45] <djQuery> how is it supposed to know the difference between when you are selecting and when you are createing?
[10:32:02] <Eviltwin> Just put the HTML in there, dude
[10:33:22] <nFFF> You could probably write a function that does it using regex quite easily
[10:33:41] <dmsuperman> djQuery: Having another method name would be fine I don't care
[10:33:57] <dmsuperman> I just want to use the same syntax for both, it's for dialogs recieving configurations
[10:34:04] <dmsuperman> the library should create the elements if they don't exist
[10:34:08] <dmsuperman> and then reselect them once they do
[10:34:15] <Eviltwin> nFFF: So how does $(".foo .bar") differ from $(".foo > .bar")?
[10:34:23] <Eviltwin> In the construction syntax he's looking for
[10:34:43] <dmsuperman> and we have hundreds of dialogs edited by people with varying degrees of technical knowledge but most of them at least get jquery
[10:34:49] <dmsuperman> selectors anyway
[10:34:49] <Eviltwin> dmsuperman: How about you just build it once and wlays refer to it that way
[10:34:50] <nFFF> Ok it would get considerably harder if you start using more speciifc selectors :>
[10:35:10] <Eviltwin> dmsuperman: But not HTML?
[10:35:13] <djQuery> [{selector: 'div.herp span#derp', createor: <div class="herp"><span id="derp"></span></div>', name: 'derp'}]
[10:35:24] <dmsuperman> Eviltwin: It's more about them not being able to keep several things in sync
[10:35:32] <dmsuperman> they can't really manage too well, we get lots of errors
[10:35:43] <dmsuperman> so to simplify we're making everything have only a single copy, a single template
[10:35:46] <dmsuperman> a single form structure
[10:35:48] <dmsuperman> single data structure
[10:35:55] <dmsuperman> I have a valid reason for doing this
[10:35:59] <dmsuperman> I'm sure it will help us
[10:35:59] <Eviltwin> All I can say is that trying to blur the lines between selecting existing elements and creating new ones is a bad idea
[10:36:22] <dmsuperman> Eviltwin: that's the point, they shouldn't have to care or even know that it's being used to create
[10:36:47] <Eviltwin> And I'm telling you it's a bad idea
[10:36:47] <nFFF> But his point is dmsuperman, is that as selectors become complex, how to do you translate it to html code
[10:36:50] <nFFF> thats the hard part
[10:36:59] <dmsuperman> Eviltwin: Based on your experience doing it?
[10:37:10] <dmsuperman> Or your hunches
[10:37:38] <Eviltwin> Selectors are designed for selecting an element or multiple elements based on some information about the element or its ancestry
[10:37:42] <dmsuperman> nFFF: I understand, I was figuring maybe such a system might just fail silently for things which don't translate. Sounds more and more like I'll be building the system
[10:37:50] <dmsuperman> Eviltwin: quite so
[10:38:09] <Eviltwin> Selectors specifically don't require you to specify the full path to the element
[10:38:42] <jahrichie> Hey guys.  Using a carousel  at the bottom of this page  http://chyeaa.com/charlie-bravo/mgmt/  -- I need to add a class to the images that navigate the carousel, when their slide is active.  Failing at all the tricks I tried so far, any help would be very appreciated.
[10:38:45] <Eviltwin> So how would a selector like ".a .b .c" be turned into HTML and how would that be different than ".a > .b > .c"?
[10:38:46] <djQuery> did something happen to :selected in the newest patch?
[10:38:47] <dmsuperman> I'm aware. these aren't complex selectors they're using
[10:39:08] <dmsuperman> I may just lazy parse them myself and guess at the jquery implementation if nothing
[10:39:44] <dmsuperman> Eviltwin: they would be the same in that case.
[10:39:54] <ajpiano> dmsuperman there is a plugin that does that already
[10:40:07] <ajpiano> ?g james padolsey jquery satisfy plugin
[10:40:08] <dmsuperman> ajpiano: perfect that's exactly what I was asking here for, what's it called?
[10:40:08] <bot-t> ajpiano, Satisfy that selector!  James Padolsey - http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/satisfy-that-selector/
[10:40:24] <dmsuperman> perfect!
[10:40:25] <ajpiano> i dont know just how well it works, but it def existss
[10:40:28] <dmsuperman> exactly what I was hoping for
[10:40:34] <dmsuperman> I'll play with it and see
[10:40:38] <dmsuperman> I suspect it'll be fine for our uses
[10:41:32] <djQuery> blendedbychris, see ?checked
[10:41:32] <bot-t> blendedbychris, :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[10:49:21] <djQuery> blendedbychris, http://jsbin.com/ayicak/edit#javascript,html,live
[10:51:54] <djQuery> blendedbychris, or if you want it faster http://jsbin.com/ayicak/2/edit
[10:53:27] <djQuery> jahrichie, which carosel are you using. does it have an on change even?
[10:54:32] <jahrichie> djQuery:  thanks for anything in advance, http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/stepcarousel.htm is the carousel -- I don;t think it has what I want built in, because i;m using images and not the provided stuff
[10:56:18] <djQuery> jahrichie, looks like it has an onslide event that you could attach to
[10:58:00] <djQuery> jahrichie, search for onslide # the page you linked to
[11:04:59] <kavelot2> any ideas why css({'MsTransform': 'rotate(1rad)'}) is not working on IE9?
[11:05:03] <kavelot2> I tried 'msTransform' too
[11:05:27] <Haraldson> if in string, you should be using '-ms-transform'?
[11:05:35] <Haraldson> if not string, probably msTransform?
[11:05:49] <kavelot2> hm, 'MozTransform' and 'WebkitTransform' works
[11:05:51] <kavelot2> but gona try
[11:06:17] <ezio> $("a", "<a href='mailto:a@b.com'>a@b.com</a>").innerHtml() ... anyone know why this returns nothing?
[11:07:05] <djQuery> ezio, escape the @ sign"?
[11:07:11] <djQuery> ?selectors
[11:07:12] <bot-t> Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 13, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[11:07:22] <kavelot> didn't work
[11:07:32] <ezio> djQuery, actually it's a variable with that content ... i just put it in text for expression
[11:07:32] <kavelot> worst thing is that I this IE debug bar seems useless
[11:07:39] <djQuery> ezio, if you wish to use any of the meta-characters ( such as !"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\
[11:07:42] <Validatorian> CSS 13?! How long have I been sleeping?
[11:07:48] <ezio> $("a", "<a href='mailto:ab.com'>ab.com</a>").innerHtml() ... anyone know why this returns nothing?
[11:08:36] <djQuery> ezio, still that will resolve to a string. and cause the issue
[11:08:59] <Eviltwin> $("<a href='mailto:ab.com'>ab.com</a>").find("a")
[11:09:19] <Eviltwin> Actually that won't work either
[11:09:29] <Eviltwin> Because .find doesn't incldue the elements in the collection
[11:09:39] <djQuery> filter
[11:09:42] <Eviltwin> And  $("<a href='mailto:ab.com'>ab.com</a>") produces a collection with one element, the "A"
[11:09:46] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[11:09:58] <Eviltwin> Or just $("<a href='mailto:ab.com'>ab.com</a>")
[11:11:50] <andrew9183> hi evil !

[11:28:30] <djQuery> http://www.evotech.net/blog/2007/06/introduction-to-firebug/#fb_js
[11:30:27] <krong> what does that mean
[11:30:36] <krong> supersized is not a function
[11:33:07] <krong> ????
[11:33:28] <djQuery> just do $.supersized() and see if you still get the error. if so it means that your scipt is not included correctly or not in the right order
[11:33:40] <djQuery> jquery needs to be before supersized prob
[11:36:56] <krong> but jqeury is before supersized
[11:37:25] <djQuery> do you get an error if you just do $.suppersized();
[11:38:00] <Phrogz> suppersized? Someone's hungry!
[11:38:48] <krong> djquery: do it where
[11:39:04] <djQuery> in console or on ur page either
[11:40:39] <krong> i think it is conflicting with another jqeury
[11:41:30] <djQuery> krong, switch to chrome | right click anywhere on the page  | choose inspect element | click on the Console button | next to the > type $.fn.suppersize
[11:41:37] <djQuery> notice that its undefined
[11:42:37] <djQuery> its prob becase you might have editid the script and added jQuery.noConflict(); to the start of the script
[11:42:47] <djQuery> thats not the way to do noConflict
[11:42:59] <djQuery> ?noconflict@krong
[11:42:59] <bot-t> krong, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[11:43:50] <krong> i removed it
[11:43:57] <krong> but still nothing change
[11:46:42] <NoiseEee> conflicting with another jquery?
[11:48:03] <NoiseEee> also, invalid html won't help krong
[11:48:16] <krong> ?
[11:48:16] <NoiseEee> you have a bunch of noise being printed to screen before your document body starts
[11:49:05] <krong> ?
[11:49:14] <objNoob> Hello. I'm trying to create a plugin for jQuery-- there is a timerIdleCheck setTimeout check that i want to call the this.showTimeoutWarning memember
[11:49:20] <objNoob> http://pastebin.com/S7RY7fN5
[11:49:26] <objNoob> I get a function not defined
[11:49:37] <monk12> if i have a long question here that i just typed. do I hit enter and let IRC split up the message into 2. or should i type two messages (split at different setences)? wasnt sure proper etiquette.
[11:49:45] <NoiseEee> also krong, look at your error console.
[11:49:46] <objNoob> i tried calling it with this. prepended to the function name
[11:49:52] <NoiseEee> krong: Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function
[11:50:27] <krong> noise: i am using an ajax page loader as well, when i disable that this slider works fine
[11:50:51] <djQuery> krong, cool you got it fixed
[11:51:08] <krong> lol it isnt fixed
[11:51:26] <NoiseEee> krong: because $ isn't defined when you're ajax page loading code starts.
[11:51:28] <djQuery> is the loader loading a version of jquery AFTER you did had the supersize script
[11:51:29] <NoiseEee> put it in the onready
[11:51:58] <jahrichie> djQuery: am i close ? http://pastebin.com/mHc1xpxG
[11:52:40] <monk12> maybe i can shorten... in a non-ajax app i can do $('.dob-hidden').each(...fillMM_DD_YYYY_DROPDOWNS();...); how would i do this in an ajax app (where .dob-hidden comes through ajax content)? a short setInterval to 'watch' for it?, check if that content has one of my special fields that needs extra treatment?
[11:52:56] <djQuery> jahrichie, probably want to do $('.highlight').removeClass('highlight'); first
[11:53:27] <krong> whats the best way to solve this
[11:53:32] <djQuery> jahrichie, otherwise I need the original link again
[11:53:54] <djQuery> krong, start from scratch and add each script one at a time
[11:54:08] <djQuery> once it breaks look at what the script does
[11:54:18] <jahrichie> djQuery:  http://chyeaa.com/charlie-bravo/mgmt/
[11:56:01] <thomedy> i have 2 js files both with seperate functionalities my question is this should i combine this files because of xlr requests and what not or can i keep them seperate like you would a class/object
[11:56:22] <djQuery> jahrichie, give me something to search on where is the slide initialized?
[11:56:39] <doc|work> hey, has anyone managed to get animation for backgroundPosition to work? I'm having some trouble with it: 			backgroundPosition: (leftpos - $(window).width())+'px '+pbgo.top+ 'px'
[11:56:46] <jahrichie> http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/stepcarousel.htm
[11:57:02] <jahrichie> djQuery: that was the original link I showed u (I thnk)
[11:57:26] <krong> ?
[11:58:06] <jahrichie> djQuery: I'm basically just adding an opacity class to the which ever slide is current present
[11:58:12] <djQuery> I mean where on your page
[11:58:30] <djQuery> there are a lot of script tags on there
[11:58:59] <jahrichie> djQuery:  Yeah sorry, that's one messy sandbox!
[11:59:11] <jahrichie> djQuery:  prob better off just looking at the http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/stepcarousel.htm
[11:59:14] <jahrichie> that's on;y the slider
[11:59:30] <jahrichie> djQuery: thanks in advance you've def sent me down the right track!
[11:59:55] <djQuery> no thats a completly blank document
[12:01:33] <djQuery> jahrichie, ^^^^^
[12:05:10] <raj> I have an array, and I'm doing JSON.stringify on it. however, I'd like to instead have '+' signs instead of commas
[12:05:15] <raj> is there a way to do this in 1 shot?
[12:05:19] <raj> or elegantly
[12:05:39] <jahrichie> djQuery:  sorry man Had a call, stupid calls.  Where were we!
[12:06:50] <raj> also, the strings in the array may have commas
[12:06:55] <raj> so I don't want to touch those
[12:07:49] <mlechner> may be anybody arrived who can tell me a slideshow plugin that is abel to run a slideshow within a jquery ui dialog window?
[12:08:46] <raj> mlechner, why can't most of them?
[12:08:55] <raj> jquery-ui dialogs just display divs
[12:12:00] <jahrichie> djQuery:  I know i'm close, just only a few months into the query
[12:12:19] <djQuery> jahrichie, REALY i just started today
[12:12:26] <jahrichie> hahaha
[12:12:33] <jahrichie> djQuery: respect!
[12:12:44] <mlechner> raj, but divs within a dialog seem to be moved out if initilalized by a slideshow plugins
[12:13:13] <raj> what do you mean moved out?
[12:13:58] <blendedbychris> djQuery: hey just came back from lunch
[12:14:25] <djQuery> raj, mlechner, it maybe the way that the dialog is hidden to sart with?    anything that is in the div  that is going to be dialoged stays in the dialog, HOWEVER the dialog is revmoved from its parent and attached to the body element
[12:14:26] <mlechner> raj, out of the div container of the dialog.
[12:15:04] <blendedbychris> djQuery: i read your message about checked but it still doesn't seem to work
[12:15:29] <djQuery> <div id="dialogme" title="Cool slideshow"><ul id="slideshowme"></ul></div>
[12:15:33] <mlechner> djQuery, and if a slideshow behaves the same (removing the elements from parent and attaching it to the body element) ...
[12:16:18] <djQuery> mlechner, then you have a problem
[12:16:22] <mlechner> djQuery, raj, may be I have to prepare a minimalistic example at jsfiddle
[12:16:52] <jahrichie> djQuery: what link were you asking about earlier, sorry again!
[12:16:57] <mlechner> djQuery, that'S the reason why I try to find a slideshow plugin behaving differently
[12:17:08] <djQuery> this is the best slider I have seen http://www.kyrielles.net/sliderkit/sliderkit_en.html
[12:17:39] <djQuery> doesnt appear to move the items around too much
[12:18:08] <blendedbychris> I specifically am using the code referenced in the .val() documentation for http://app.fellowshipchurch.com/html/contact-us/prayer and I can't get the radio boxes to give a value… $('input:radio[name=visitor_type]:checked').val();
[12:18:52] <mlechner> djQuery, I'll try it out and will come back (tomorrow) with a jsfiddle example. N8
[12:18:53] <djQuery> blendedbychris, search upwards for my name I sent you a link to a jsbin that had it workin
[12:19:11] <supermanjnk> anyone here familiar with jquery ui tabs?
[12:19:40] <blendedbychris> djQuery: doesn't seem to work http://jsbin.com/ayicak/2/edit
[12:19:43] <blendedbychris> the link
[12:21:10] <djQuery> works for me. If I change checked radio it put it in the <div id="v">
[12:21:23] <djQuery> I might have changed the values on you though
[12:23:06] <blendedbychris> uh what?
[12:23:57] <djQuery> blendedbychris, this easier to understand? http://jsbin.com/ayicak/3/edit
[12:24:15] <blendedbychris> that link flat out doesn't work heh
[12:24:28] <blendedbychris> different paste bin for me? :(
[12:24:53] <Beast> Hi guys, do you know why i'm getting this error in ie7? error: document.body.appendChild(d);
[12:25:45] <djQuery> blendedbychris, http://jsfiddle.net/u5xfR/
[12:26:33] <djQuery> beast: are you using jquery to do it or typeing that exact code?
[12:27:23] <djQuery> beast, try this$('body').append('<b>YEAH</b>')
[12:27:48] <Beast> i am using jquery it actually says document.body is null or not an object
[12:28:40] <djQuery> beast, version?  console.log($.fn);
[12:29:37] <djQuery> beast, rather console.log(jQuery.fn.jquery;)
[12:30:24] <Beast> ok i'll try it
[12:39:46] <monk12> Anyone when they are debugging in Firebug have their jquery effects not work? I see the slideDown effect ... but its not actually sllding down when i debug in Firebug (just seems to repeated call jQuery.fx.tick() function. Seems to not call the complete/success function when i am debugging.
[12:40:18] <Eviltwin> Maybe you broke something
[12:40:23] <monk12> by "i see the slideDown effect",  i mean i see the debugger go past it in the code.
[12:40:40] <monk12> think ive had that experience before. I'll try to replicate in jsfiddle
[12:44:22] <Aquaguy> Hey there
[12:44:28] <yottabit> i have a set of photos being displayed on a page, and i need a form below the photos so users can type in a couple of words describing those photos, is there something like this already built that i can use?...
[12:45:10] <shoky> <form><input /></form>
[12:45:37] <yottabit> huh.
[12:45:45] <yottabit> now to save the user's input..
[12:45:55] <shoky> you didn't say anything about that
[12:46:09] <Aquaguy> I've made a jquery plugin to work with multilanguage forms and I'm using a third party validation plugin. Both plugins perform some actions when the form is submited, is there any way to force tha validate plugin to execute after my plugin has finished doing its thing?
[12:47:06] <djQuery> Aquaguy, think they run in the order that they are bound
[12:47:22] <Aquaguy> djQuery, ok, great. Thank you
[12:49:05] <brettster> hey guys - i'm using the jquery.cookie plugin
[12:49:06] <brettster> http://pastie.org/3716441
[12:49:08] <brettster> thats my code
[12:49:15] <brettster> basically it's a browser detect for chrome
[12:49:20] <brettster> if chrome - display pop up
[12:49:31] <brettster> but the client needs the pop up to display only once
[12:49:40] <brettster> i have little to no experience setting cookies with js
[12:49:48] <brettster> so could you please tell me what i'm doing wrong
[12:50:37] <djQuery> check to see if the cookie is set if not set the cookie and do the popup
[12:50:52] <Eviltwin> brettster: Are you aware that jQuery already uses $.browser?
[12:50:53] <djQuery> brettster, sorry no experience with the cookie plugin
[12:51:05] <djQuery> Eviltwin, that that was depreciated

[12:53:56] <brettster> is it possibly my if statements
[12:53:59] <monk12> Eviltwin, so if i set a breakpoint in jsfiddle's code: http://jsfiddle.net/armyofda12mnkeys/7uztL/  at the $('#latest')... line and the console.log line... it replicates my problem.
[12:54:34] <monk12> so if i hit continue, it should get to the complete/success function... but it doesnt. the box stays mostly hidden.
[12:55:18] <monk12> not sure why Firebug debugging would stop a jquery effect from completing.
[12:56:40] <Eviltwin> Worked perfectly fine for me here
[12:57:46] <monk12> Eviltwin, so when you debug those lines it works fine? when page loads works fine for me... until i add debugging.
[12:58:14] <Eviltwin> It works fine for me either way
[12:58:20] <Eviltwin> Not sure what you're doing
[12:58:21] <monk12> maybe i have a bad plugin or something conflicting with Firebug hehe.
[12:58:33] <Eviltwin> This is no laughing matter
[12:59:13] <andrew9183> HAHAHAHA
[13:01:16] <erbium> hey does anyone know why switchclass might not be working in IE?
[13:01:20] <monk12> Eviltwin, http://i.imgur.com/P3cDB.jpg does your breakpoints look like that?
[13:02:12] <monk12> u can see the slideDown effect didn't work for me after i click Continue on line 30 (never makes it into 31)
[13:02:41] <justinhjohnson> erbium, perhaps it's working but your styles aren't cascading properly?
[13:03:35] <jahrichie> djQuery:  Believe it or not, still haven't gotten it to work, lol.
[13:04:51] <monk12> oh i see how i can replicate... Continue (/F8/play button) works fine... if i click Step Over (so it gets to line 32). then click Continue... then it fails heh.
[13:07:02] <Dr4g> Is it acceptable to register a "window.onunload" callback within the <script> tag on the <body> or must it be registered in the <head>
[13:07:21] <Dr4g> There are some conditionals here that are verified mid-way through <body> content.
[13:07:54] <Eviltwin> It's acceptable to register the unload event anywhere you want
[13:08:01] <Eviltwin> Just preferable not after unload
[13:08:38] <Dr4g> Eviltwin: thanks. I got your first message but didn't understand the latter.
[13:09:00] <Eviltwin> It was a joke
[13:09:03] <brettster> got it
[13:09:06] <brettster> thanks anyways guys
[13:09:08] <Dr4g> Eviltwin: oh :D
[13:09:24] <Dr4g> I'll register my event handler just before the </body> tag. :-)
[13:11:09] <Dr4g> Eviltwin: onunload vs onbeforeunload
[13:11:13] <Dr4g> differences ?
[13:11:51] <CharlieM751> anyone know of a clever way to clear focus without calling blur()? I have functions tied to onblur that I don't want to fire at the point I want to clear the focus
[13:12:20] <monk12> heh, Im guessing you can't debug jquery very well with effects. putting debug points before and after the slideDown (on lines 30/36 in jsfiddles code), and hitting continue doesnt work: http://jsfiddle.net/armyofda12mnkeys/7uztL/2/
[13:12:38] <Eviltwin> Dr4g: Google is your friend
[13:12:49] <Dr4g> CharlieM751: once you focus on something else, the element that was previously focuses gets blur() called by the browser.
[13:13:01] <Dr4g> You should add additional logic to your blur() function calls.
[13:18:51] <erbium> justinhjohnson : you still there? what can you tell me about how my styles may not be cascaindg properly?
[13:19:50] <justinhjohnson> erbium: can you first confirm whether or not the HTML element has the correct class name after your code runs?
[13:20:01] <justinhjohnson> using something like firebug lite or the IE dev tools
[13:20:34] <erbium> it does not
[13:20:38] <erbium> it doesn't change it
[13:20:45] <erbium> and if i put an alert after the switchClass
[13:20:47] <erbium> it doesn't go off
[13:20:49] <erbium> it works fine in chrome
[13:20:50] <erbium> but not IE9
[13:21:03] <justinhjohnson> can you setup a jsfiddle for me? i'll take a look
[13:21:20] <erbium> uhhh ok let me try
[13:22:06] <justinhjohnson> or just a gist with the JS code
[13:22:08] <justinhjohnson> :)
[13:22:20] <erbium> there are too many dependencies
[13:22:26] <erbium> to make a jsfiddle
[13:22:34] <erbium> but i can do a gist i believe
[13:22:38] <erbium> of just the function
[13:22:48] <geoffw8_> Good day sirs, anyone here used jQuery BBQ much?
[13:23:09] <geoffw8_> *sirs and sirs'ettes
[13:23:18] <jahrichie> Need some help adding  a onslide() event  handler  to the slider at the bottom of this page
[13:23:21] <jahrichie> http://chyeaa.com/charlie-bravo/mgmt/
[13:23:24] <Dr4g> geoffw8_: I have used it yes. If you have a specific problem ask away.
[13:23:27] <justinhjohnson> erbium: sounds good, do that please :)
[13:23:30] <monk12> geoffw8_, I've looked at it. but be better just to ask your question.
[13:23:36] <geoffw8_> k
[13:23:43] <geoffw8_> woops, meant to say "ok"
[13:23:45] <jahrichie> any pointers? I'd like a class to be added to the nav images when that respected slide is active
[13:23:49] <geoffw8_> thanks guys, question is essentially here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9982757/jquery-bbq-plugin-confusion
[13:24:20] <erbium> https://gist.github.com/2286970 justinhjohnson
[13:24:32] <geoffw8_> I don't mean to push you guys off to SO, however, my problem in a gist is although I have some of the plugin working, I seem to be unable to get it working fully, across all of my pages. It is as though it only wants to work one layer deep
[13:25:37] <geoffw8_> I wondered if anything was immediately obvious from that implementation as to why that might be the case? I would have thought that each and every a href should be picked up
[13:25:39] <monk12> look at url when click Kebabs and Steak: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-advanced/  do you want '2 layers' like that.
[13:25:44] <geoffw8_> I mean, why would some work, but not others, thats the strange thing
[13:25:48] <geoffw8_> monk12: let me see
[13:25:56] <justinhjohnson> erbium: are both switchClass's failing, or just the one on line 17?
[13:26:29] <monk12> Their setup are more complex though in their 'advanced' example. Might want to read the code on that page and copy to your app.
[13:26:41] <geoffw8_> monk12: not really as such. Imagine my site is structure like Facebook, navigation across the top, with a menu on the left. It currently works for the top menu, but not the second
[13:26:49] <erbium> both
[13:27:08] <monk12> well that page is 2 menu's.
[13:27:23] <monk12> geoffw8_,  seems like exactly what you want.
[13:27:30] <geoffw8_> monk12: maybe you are right. Maybe my top page works as is, but then the second layer works with fragments
[13:27:34] <geoffw8_> ok, I'll give that a go
[13:27:36] <monk12> geoffw8_,  (except location of the menus)
[13:27:40] <geoffw8_> thanking you muchly!
[13:27:42] <monk12> but thats all css and not related.
[13:27:46] <geoffw8_> heh, I wish it was the menu's, mmm
[13:27:51] <monk12> k maybe i'll answer and get some SO points hehe.
[13:27:54] <erbium> the original background is a gradient background (works in IE using svg)
[13:28:02] <geoffw8_> thanks, will give it a try
[13:28:10] <monk12> k
[13:28:10] <erbium> the nullbackground is just a transparent background
[13:28:10] <geoffw8_> monk12: feel free, I'll be watching the thread
[13:28:20] <erbium> the text of the buttoms are written in SVG by raphaeljs
[13:38:25] <LakWork> any jquery mobile people here? #jquerymobile is where questions go to die
[13:38:33] <LakWork> are there any techniques i can use to ensure that the content of my page always pushes the footer to the bottom of the screen without fixing it? I dont want fixed footer functionality, just the ability to make sure the page always fills the window- even if it is just a bunch of whitespace
[13:38:40] <LakWork> (jquery mobile)
[13:40:04] <Lobosque> in chrome, $(document).ready() fires before images are loaded. how do I wait to get images loaded? because I'm doing calculations using their height.
[13:40:44] <tomster2300> hey guys, i have what may even be a basic javascript question.  I'm trying to find all instances of a string and then output those strings
[13:41:21] <tomster2300> all i have so far is $('*:contains("my string")');
[13:41:29] <tomster2300> and then i dont know what else to do
[13:42:33] <tomster2300> i tried putting that into a variable and then tried to alert or console.log that and i just get a null value
[13:45:07] <danzik17> Lobosque: use $( window ).load
[13:50:18] <Mapper99> I am trying to populate a select based on values in a text file - http://pastebin.com/vx16pVPN   I can't seem to get the select to populate. Any idea why not?
[13:50:22] <Lobosque> danzik17 thanks
[13:57:21] <nFFF> Mapper99, where is it failing?
[13:58:24] <dethkrieg> Question, when you use $.parseJSON, the number 2.0 will get converted to 2 and lose precision, how do you prevent this?
[13:58:52] <dethkrieg> ex: {"grade" : 2.0} becomes Object {this=2}
[13:59:21] <dethkrieg> er, Object {grade=2}
[14:04:12] <spyvsspy> I have some jquery
[14:04:14] <spyvsspy> https://gist.github.com/2287184
[14:04:31] <spyvsspy> it does not run on page load, but if I evaluate it in the console, it works as expected
[14:04:33] <nFFF> dethkrieg, have you tried passing the 2.0 as a string?
[14:04:40] <nFFF> and then parseInt later
[14:04:41] <spyvsspy> anyone help w/ that?  its a rails 3.1 app
[14:05:20] <spyvsspy> ( I just updated it with the coffee file)
[14:05:38] <dethkrieg> nFFF, okay, I'll try that, thanks
[14:06:01] <Mapper99> <nFFF> no data is being populated in the list
[14:06:10] <Mapper99> <nFFF>the ajax call is good
[14:06:48] <nFFF> Mapper99, whats the ajax call returning?
[14:07:20] <Validatorian> what would the proper syntax be for a selector that only allows elements with a single child? $('.container').not(function () { $(this).children().size() > 1 }) doesn't work...
[14:07:58] <paul_irish> .filter(function(){  this children size == 1 })
[14:08:11] <nFFF> dethkrieg, http://jsfiddle.net/7jKX3/
[14:08:18] <Validatorian> thank you paul
[14:08:45] <raj> if I wanted mysite.com/?titles='To Kill a Mockingbird, Volume II','Little Women, the Busty Edition','Hello World!'&sortby='Author','Release Date'  ...what should mygetdata look like, if I didn't encode the commas, using $.get('/receiver', mygetdata, mycallback())
[14:09:13] <Mapper99> <nFFF> a great big list of stuff...not sure if it is one string or an array
[14:09:24] <nFFF> Mapper99 log it to console?
[14:09:29] <Eviltwin> raj: With spaces in your URL like that?
[14:09:39] <doc|work> raj: urlencode it first
[14:09:41] <raj> yeah
[14:09:54] <raj> well, I don't mind + for spaces
[14:10:04] <doc|work> why be lazy about it?
[14:11:19] <nFFF> Anyone know whats happened to jquerystyle.com?
[14:11:28] <nFFF> or any similiar sites that exist?
[14:11:50] <Mapper99> <nFFF> console list - http://f.imgtmp.com/RYp78.jpg
[14:11:58] <raj`> crap, sorry, I got disconnected
[14:12:33] <raj> sorry about that
[14:12:35] <doc|work> raj: why be lazy about it? Just do it right
[14:12:43] <raj> it's not about being lazy
[14:12:48] <raj> it's about the presentation to the user
[14:13:19] <doc|work> then you don't want to have ?title=FoobarStuff anyway
[14:13:21] <raj> I was saying, I don't mind + for spaces, but urlencode will make commas in the strings have %2b or whatever, which is what I didn't want
[14:13:24] <nFFF> Mapper99, looks like a comma delited string
[14:13:31] <doc|work> you want /title/To_Kill_A_MockingBird
[14:13:32] <doc|work> or whatever
[14:13:44] <raj> oh yes
[14:13:47] <raj> that's a good idea
[14:13:57] <lenswipe> hey gusy
[14:13:58] <lenswipe> guys*
[14:14:02] <doc|work> you again!
[14:14:05] <Mapper99> <nFFF>I don't think so...the text file is just like a column of text
[14:14:05] * doc|work attacks!
[14:14:06] <lenswipe> yep XD
[14:14:13] <Mapper99> <nFFF>no commas
[14:14:14] <lenswipe> doc|work, ooohhh babay
[14:14:15] <lenswipe> harder
[14:14:16] <lenswipe> mmmn
[14:14:17] <doc|work> raj: that's a modrewrite thing
[14:14:18] <doc|work> :o
[14:14:20] <lenswipe> XD
[14:14:23] <raj> doc|work, and I can leave the commas intact?
[14:14:42] <lenswipe> if i have a list of textboxes and i want to see if a textbox with a particular value already exists how do i do that?
[14:14:54] <raj> doc|work, I was just gonna do it with js
[14:14:59] <raj> you think I should do it with the server?
[14:15:14] <nFFF> Mapper99, add this in the success callback: console.log(typeof(msg))
[14:15:20] <doc|work> raj: yep, some server side frameworks have it built in
[14:15:37] <raj> gotcha
[14:15:41] <nFFF> wait dont think that is correct javascript
[14:16:04] <raj> doc|work, so how should my getdataobject look for sending to the server?
[14:16:05] <lenswipe> anyone?
[14:16:07] <nFFF>  console.log(typeof msg)
[14:17:13] <Validatorian> strange -- .filter(function () { console.log($(this).children().size()) }) spits out a bunch of '1's and a '2' (that I'm trying to not catch) but .filter(function () { $(this).children().size() === 1 }) isn't matching anything. http://jsfiddle.net/AFDna/
[14:17:46] <Mapper99> <nFFF> Yes, there appears to be a carriage return after each item in the text file
[14:18:15] <doc|work> raj: do string replacement on it if you want underscores in place of spaces
[14:18:25] <doc|work> then you could urlencode the rest
[14:19:03] <raj> doc|work, I'm trying not to encode the commas though
[14:19:04] <nFFF> Validatorian, your last console.log is jsut checking the length of the jquery obj, which is 0
[14:19:26] <doc|work> raj: I've never had to deal with that. Sorry :/
[14:19:35] <raj> doc|work, are you suggesting sending JSON?
[14:19:47] <raj> cuz I'm not sure how else to send the data
[14:19:51] <nFFF> Validatorian, http://jsfiddle.net/AFDna/3/
[14:20:02] <doc|work> raj: wait, is this url ever going to be seen by a user?
[14:20:05] <jrockjiggz> i'm routinely editing my code, saving my work, going to the browser, refreshing.. repeat.. this is very tedious and i want to know if anyone knows a better way?
[14:20:17] <VernonK> jrockjiggz:  On a Mac?
[14:20:20] <raj> doc|work, yes
[14:20:22] <jrockjiggz> pc
[14:20:29] <nFFF> Mapper99, having comma seperated is good, you can then slice it into an array easily
[14:20:30] <jrockjiggz> or mac..
[14:20:48] <VernonK> LiveReload is what you're looking for.  (or CodeKit)
[14:20:55] <Validatorian> ah, thanks nFFF
[14:21:29] <VernonK> No refreshing… save your work it's auto in the page in your browser.  I know LiveReload has a beta out for Windows.  The Mac client is awesome though.
[14:21:42] <doc|work> raj: then how would json work?
[14:22:52] <nFFF> Validatorian, when using filter with a function, always return either true or false
[14:23:03] <Validatorian> right, silly mistake
[14:23:39] <jrockjiggz> VernonK: thats cool.. I will use that... but still, i edit my code and have to switch browser... is there a way to see live your changes.. not to mention going into inspector and then finding the el and finding the style and playing with it, only to go back to code, reproduce the values, save, check.. still not happy :(
[14:24:37] <nFFF> jrockjiggz, for small code jsfiddle is pretty cool to test things in :D
[14:24:42] <jrockjiggz> every refresh gotta reload the inspect, find the el.. find the style, fight to change the value.... theres gotta be a better way
[14:24:47] <VernonK> jrockjiggz: Yeah, that's the best I know.  I do know there are a couple IDE/Editor plug-ins that tie into Firebug (and maybe Chrome Tools) that pull your edits into your actual file.
[14:24:50] <jrockjiggz> jsfiddle is great :)
[14:25:33] <jrockjiggz> even a plugin for chrome that lets you drag the values to adjust.. the double-clicking and typing is not the best
[14:25:41] <VernonK> jrockjiggz:  With LiveReload though you won't have to do that.  The updates basically just get injected in.  That's awesome for when you have to take a few steps to get to where you're debugging.
[14:25:50] <paul_irish> jrockjiggz: file a feature request bro
[14:26:00] <paul_irish> bugs.webkit.org
[14:26:44] <jrockjiggz> ok, i edit blind with code.. i feel a wysiwyg might be the better way to go...
[14:26:48] <jrockjiggz> any preferences?
[14:27:14] <jrockjiggz> code is more control.. but man it takes a while to get it right
[14:27:24] <VernonK> jrockjiggz: Sorry, can't help you there.  Sublime Edit 2 and straight code is what I love.
[14:27:32] <VernonK> Dang… Sublime Text 2
[14:27:34] <VernonK> Dummy
[14:27:40] <VernonK> Me… not you.
[14:28:02] <raj> doc|work, so I'm okay with not sending json
[14:28:50] <VernonK> jrockjiggz:  You can't really trust the WYSIWYG all the time.  Need to check it out in several browsers still.
[14:29:17] <jrockjiggz> VernonK paul_irish nFFF: thanks..
[14:29:42] <raj> doc|work, I just don't see why sending JSON would encode the { } and [ ] and colons of JSON, yet if I send a JS object, it somehow doesn't need to encode those?
[14:30:06] <jrockjiggz> it would be so nice to have chrome built into the editor where everychange manipulates the dom live..
[14:31:17] <nFFF> raj, Im confused as in your ajax request the user will never see the requestred url unless they open up console
[14:31:22] <nFFF> so why do you care how its encoded?
[14:31:47] <raj> it's a GET request, so won't they see it in their url once they get a response?
[14:31:50] <doc|work> raj: json needs to be url encoded if it's in the url
[14:32:07] <doc|work> raj: not if you're doing it as an ajax call
[14:32:07] <dilvie> raj: why do you not want to encode the commas? I think you probably should. =)
[14:32:09] <raj> i don't want JSON with it's weird { } and : and stuff in the url
[14:32:27] <doc|work> raj: if it's just an ajax call it will never be seen by the user
[14:32:40] <doc|work> raj: I recommend trying it :)
[14:32:42] <nFFF> I dont understand raj :<
[14:32:48] <nFFF> your confusing me
[14:32:51] <raj> how would I control what the query parameters look like in the response?
[14:32:54] <doc|work> I'm not sure raj understands either :)
[14:32:56] <nFFF> your making an ajax request right?
[14:33:02] <raj> nFFF, yes
[14:33:10] <raj> GET request
[14:33:10] <dilvie> json: if you pass the JSON object I showed you into $.get(), it won't send the json, it will convert it into a normal parameterized query string.
[14:33:11] <nFFF> so how will the user see anything apart from logging console
[14:33:25] <VernonK> They won't
[14:33:29] <dilvie> raj:^^
[14:33:30] <nFFF> exactly
[14:33:31] <dilvie> sorry.
[14:33:43] <raj> so what will the response look like nFFF ?
[14:33:46] <raj> in the url
[14:33:49] <doc|work> raj: they won't see it
[14:33:55] <VernonK> It's an Ajax request… The URL won't change.
[14:33:56] <nFFF> your missing the point of ajax
[14:34:00] <doc|work> raj: ajax runs in the background as far as the current page is concerned
[14:34:06] <doc|work> raj: just try it and see
[14:34:18] <nFFF> the only way they will know is if they tunr on log xmlhttprequests in console
[14:35:09] <VernonK> Sounds like you're thinking of a GET request in terms of PHP or something where it appends a query string to the end of the URL.  That's not how Ajax works.
[14:35:44] <raj> so it'll magically look like www.mysite.com/?titles='To Kill a Mockingbird, Volume II','Little Women, the Busty Edition','Hello World!'&sortby='Author','Release Date' once the response happens?
[14:36:08] <raj> oh, yes, that's my confusion then VernonK
[14:36:09] <nFFF> raj, the url doesn't change
[14:36:16] <raj> oh, damn
[14:36:19] <raj> how can I make it change?
[14:36:23] <VernonK> Yep… Thought so.  ;)
[14:36:48] <VernonK> Why do you need the URL to change?
[14:36:48] <nFFF> by throwing an <a href> link on the DOM and letting them click the page :D
[14:37:03] <nFFF> or window.href.location for javascript iirc
[14:37:13] <raj> VernonK, so the page can be bookmarked, and shared
[14:37:28] <VernonK> Well, take a look at BBQ to manage page state.
[14:37:59] <VernonK> https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-bbq
[14:39:04] <VernonK> That will get you where you want.  You can manage state with a hash (or HTML5 pushState) and do the Ajax request for JSON to update the UI with new data.  You then have two bookmarkable (yeah, it's a word) pages.
[14:39:09] <raj> basically, for each checkbox that is checked next to the corresponding book title, I want to send that data the server to retrieve some db info
[14:39:36] <raj> but I also want that when that checkbox happens, to add a query parameter to the url
[14:40:06] <VernonK> Yeah, so you can wait for your submit (or update on the fly) the hash using BBQ and then fire off a request to update the UI.
[14:40:10] <nFFF> ok so you send an ajax request and use jquery-bbq :>
[14:40:18] <VernonK> Yep. ;)
[14:41:35] <nFFF> on an off topic tangent, do you know of anby plugins/libraries that allow for jsfiddle type url saving
[14:43:47] <Zzaichik> anby plugins is my favorite
[14:43:51] <dilvie> Vernonk, raj: the ajax request has its own URL, independent of the current document URL. Get requests do create query strings. jQuery handles the JSON object to query-string translation for you behind the scenes. If you look on your network console, you'll see the query string.
[14:43:55] <Zzaichik> ;)
[14:44:31] <VernonK> Yes, you're right but they don't update the visible URL which was (I believe) Raj's main concern.
[14:44:53] <raj> right
[14:45:06] <VernonK> No jsfiddle type url saving plug-ins off the top of my head but that would be awesome.  I think you should add it to paul_irish lazy web requests.  ;)
[14:45:12] <raj> so i might as well send JSON since I'm used to working with it
[14:45:18] <VernonK> raj: Yep
[14:45:32] <raj> it's still safe for me not to encode the commas
[14:45:55] <VernonK> In this case, as an Ajax request jQuery will manage all that behind the scenes for you.
[14:46:32] <VernonK> You'll just work with the returned data and update the URL using a library like BBQ so that you can have "state" and allow users to bookmark URL's
[14:48:29] <raj> VernonK, why do I need BBQ to do that?
[14:49:11] <VernonK> BBQ helps to add the "onhashchange" event that is supported across all browsers (along with some other useful things).
[14:49:35] <VernonK> That will give you the ability to manage "state"… or to update the URL so you can have a page that can be bookmarked.
[14:50:45] <VernonK> Or I should say "hashchange"  event  (shame on me… I always complain at work about the use of the word "on"… ha)
[14:51:10] <VernonK> I also meant "isn't" supported across all browsers
[14:51:27] <raj> it isn't supported?
[14:52:41] <raj> does this mean it adds # anchors?
[14:53:38] <raj> brb
[14:55:28] <VernonK> Yes it adds hash tags  that's how it manages state.
[14:55:56] <nFFF> VernonK, do you think jsfiddle actually creates folders on their server that match their unique url keys?
[14:56:31] <VernonK> nFFF:  I doubt that.  I'm sure it's some sort of Routing being done that match up the characters for where they are stored.
[14:56:40] <VernonK> Just uses them as a key.
[14:57:16] <nFFF> so all the data is stored in a database, with the url key?
[14:58:39] <nFFF> nvmd found it
[14:58:45] <nFFF> via PHP
[15:00:41] <VernonK> Ahh… I was looking for that.
[15:01:12] <nFFF> It just generaes a random hash key, and then inserts the key and matching page data into the db
[15:01:17] <nFFF> doesnt seem too complex
[15:01:38] <pifantastic> don't forget that it saves multuple versions of each fiddle
[15:02:14] <nFFF> Yea, I don't actually need that feature :>
[15:02:16] <VernonK> Versioning wouldn't be that hard once you had your main key.  Then it's just running a diff I assume
[15:02:39] <pifantastic> nah
[15:02:46] <pifantastic> I bet it saves the entire version seperately
[15:03:13] <VernonK> You think?  Sounds like wasted space, but I guess with all the pieces that can make up a fiddle that might be right.
[15:04:56] <nFFF> It's SQL, structure is generated with Django's ORM. Pasties and versions use separate tables. Currently code is saved in the same table due to my bad design. It's going to change in the near future.
[15:05:01] <nFFF> ^^ from the creator
[15:17:30] <VernonK> Ha… Nice info.
[15:24:10] <brunodbo> hi - I have a iframe in a div that I want to make resizable(), and am running into http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/3176 (I think). is there a good way to do this 2 years later?
[15:30:52] <djQuery> how can I set window.location.hash?
[15:31:34] <djQuery> Tying this but it doesnt seem to be workin http://jsbin.com/oyuvuv/3/edit
[15:32:49] <blindMoe> djQuery: ever heard of jquery BBQ?
[15:33:05] <djQuery> blindMoe, hopin not to have to use that
[15:33:20] <blindMoe> djQuery: You could look to see what methods it uses
[15:33:57] <lenswipe> hey guys
[15:34:07] <lenswipe> anyone know of a version of append() that works in IE?
[15:35:32] <djQuery> lenswipe, dont know of a version that doesnt
[15:35:39] <djQuery> ?code
[15:35:42] <bot-t> djQuery, jQuery CDN - provided by (mt) Media Temple - http://code.jquery.com/
[15:35:43] <lenswipe> djQuery, sure
[15:36:02] <lenswipe> djQuery, http://95.146.94.240/prismvc/dashboard/add
[15:36:05] <lenswipe> username is "scott"
[15:36:08] <lenswipe> password is "scott"
[15:38:38] <dilvie> raj: "I was saying, I don't mind + for spaces, but urlencode will make commas in the strings have %2b or whatever, which is what I didn't want" -- users don't see the ajax get urls. Those get fetched behind the scenes and data gets loaded into the currently displayed page.
[15:38:54] <dilvie> So it shouldn't matter if your ajax get request has funky characters in it.
[15:39:32] <djQuery> blindMoe, just window.location.hash = value works my example wasnt working because of the way that jsbin runs the output in an iframe
[15:39:47] <blindMoe> ahh yeah that would do it
[15:55:32] <raj> oh no, vernonk left
[15:55:37] <raj> anyone use bbq?
[16:00:13] <Andrew131> My draggable is moving underneath my droppable.  The draggable is a li in a ul.  Anyone have this happen before?
[16:00:34] <raj> Andrew131, z-index perhaps?
[16:02:20] <Andrew131> I didn't mess with them if thats what your asking
[16:02:37] <raj> i'm saying, maybe you should :)
[16:02:50] <Andrew131> oh lol
[16:02:52] <raj> cuz otherwise it's just a guess which one is the one in front, no?
[16:03:00] <raj> i think the one made last is top
[16:03:30] <Andrew131> Well its like once its outside its bulleted list it under everything which doesnt make sense to me.  I could mess with the z-index though
[16:03:51] <Andrew131> It seems like moving a li from one ul to another wouldn't involve it though
[16:04:07] <raj> i've never actually used what you're referring to, I just thought I'd throw z-index out there
[16:04:15] <Andrew131> haha
[16:04:19] <Andrew131> =D
[16:05:39] <blindMoe> Andrew131: that is one of the bugs I haved listed as TO-FIX on one of my sites
[16:05:52] <Andrew131> So it is a bug =D
[16:06:11] <tktiddle> how can i search this for sum elements?  like $(this).$('.some-class')
[16:06:48] <Andrew131> tktiddle, find
[16:06:55] <tktiddle> thansk!!
[16:07:14] <Andrew131> np
[16:07:23] <Andrew131> you might look at children too depending on what your doing
[16:07:42] <raj> i was wondering what he was adding up
[16:07:45] <Andrew131> blindMoe, what do you think about messing with zindex like raj said
[16:07:52] <Andrew131> lol
[16:07:53] <blindMoe> Andrew131: heheI just checked my site and it is working properly now
[16:07:58] <blindMoe> maybe I fixed it and forgot :)
[16:08:35] <Andrew131> or what  version of jquery/jquery ui are you using?  Perhaps they fixed it
[16:12:02] <lenswipe> djQuery, i found the problem
[16:16:44] <bakers> What's the RIGHT way to find the selected option in a select?
[16:17:00] <raj> bakers, .val()
[16:17:02] <bakers> $("select > option").is(":selected") ???
[16:17:20] <raj> or $('select :selected')
[16:17:48] <jnettik> anyone know of a starting point for a slide effect that slides to the center of the screen vertically
[16:32:02] <Andrew131> raj thanks setting the z-index fixes it
[16:32:09] <Andrew131> seems wierd for it not to work like that from the start
[16:33:58] <raj> yeah, you'd think a plugin would take care of that
[16:34:08] <Andrew131> Well it has the option
[16:34:19] <Andrew131> just disabled by defauly
[16:36:31] <djQuery> lenswipe, cool what was it
[16:37:01] <lenswipe> djQuery, my own version of mod_deflate i had going on in codeigniter broke AJAX in IE
[16:37:04] <lenswipe> stupid ie
[16:37:10] <lenswipe> f**k you microsoft
[16:37:33] <djQuery> http://saveie6.com
[16:37:41] <lenswipe> please no
[16:37:46] <djQuery> take a look at the download wizard
[16:39:12] <Andrew131> lol
[16:39:39] <Andrew131> It's true... you could install pretty much anything you wanted with IE6
[16:39:40] <djQuery> they have been getting better
[16:40:01] <djQuery> Andrew131, wether you wanted it installed or not
[16:40:06] <abjorn> hmmm im tempted to watch ancient aliens on netflix just for giorgio
[16:40:10] <Andrew131> *wink*
[16:40:29] <lenswipe> djQuery, i think i would rather chop off my own dick than replace google chrome with IE6
[16:41:08] <Andrew131> lenswipe, your one dedicated man
[16:41:17] <djQuery> sadly I have been having to use FF instead of chrome do to some bugs in canary
[16:41:22] <lenswipe> Andrew131, not really i just hate IE with a passion
[16:41:37] <lenswipe> Internet Explorer should die of gonorrhea and rot in hell
[16:41:55] <djQuery> i spent 10 years supporting a call tracking software that would only run in IE
[16:42:00] <Andrew131> So then the chopping would be purely a preventive measure
[16:43:05] <djQuery> it was such spagetti code that finaly when enough customers said it HAD to work in FF, they just bought out another product and discontinued the ie only prod
[16:44:34] <b0x> try supporting a 10pin bowling centre system from 86 running on p1's
[16:51:29] <djQuery> b0x, cant be any worse than walking a blind guy through setting up his hp scanner in safe mode using the scussi connector
[17:00:05] <djQuery> to set checked do I use attr or prop?
[17:00:12] <djQuery> allways get that confused
[17:01:02] <shoky> prop
[17:03:25] <LakWork> $('.content').on('change', '.searchregion-wrp input[type=radio]', function (ev) {  }
[17:03:57] <LakWork> provided i have two input[type=radio] returned by that selector, the change event should fire for both of them any time one of them is clicked, right?
[17:04:05] <LakWork> (they both have the same name)
[17:04:40] <shoky> why for both?
[17:05:01] <djQuery> hmmm it would fire twice
[17:05:28] <shoky> oh, change event
[17:06:41] <lenswipe> can someone help?
[17:06:58] <lenswipe> im trying to find all textboxes with a certain value
[17:07:01] <lenswipe> how do i do that?
[17:07:02] <RazLaptop> Is there a way to force a helper clone to the top? My div is sliding under other CSS div's
[17:07:39] <LakWork> i thought so djQuery. something's weird
[17:08:22] <nights``> hi
[17:08:26] <nights``> im using jquery ui tabs
[17:08:39] <djQuery> LakWork, see ?demo
[17:08:40] <bot-t> LakWork, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:08:52] <nights``> and then ajaxStart and ajaxStop to display a loading div
[17:09:03] <nights``> however, the second time you click a tab, the content is already loaded
[17:09:04] <djQuery> nights``, yeah for you
[17:09:12] <nights``> but ajaxStep doesnt disappear
[17:09:13] <raj> are $.map and .each(...myarray.push(somestuff)) trustworthy to keep order in building an array in an exact/consistent order?
[17:09:26] <nights``> anyone know how to solve this?
[17:09:34] <djQuery> raj, give it a try
[17:09:47] <raj> djQuery, yes, it works...but i wanna know that it works for all browsers
[17:09:51] <Eviltwin> raj: Yes
[17:09:57] <Eviltwin> It's not asynchronous or anythign like that
[17:10:16] <djQuery> raj, well thats a different story
[17:10:21] <raj> where does synchrony come into play?
[17:10:31] <raj> djQuery, that's "trustworthy"
[17:10:34] <djQuery> there is always see ?bugs
[17:10:35] <bot-t> Just because you think it's a bug, doesn't mean it's a bug. Most of the time you're doing it wrong#softwaredevelopment
[17:11:15] <djQuery> that used to be a link to the bug db
[17:12:04] <lenswipe> anyone around that can help?
[17:12:05] <raj> i just wanted to make sure I didn't need to check against the `name` of the element, since that contains the absolute index of the element
[17:12:15] <raj> (sort criteria)
[17:12:22] <shoky> lenswipe, how about: ?$('input???????????????????????[type="text"]').filter('[value="bla"]')
[17:12:24] <shoky> er
[17:12:35] <raj> hey there shoky :)
[17:12:35] <Eviltwin> raj: I guess I'm not quite sure what you're concerned about
[17:12:44] <shoky> lets see: ?$('input???????????????????????[type="text"]').filter('[value="bla"]')
[17:12:46] <shoky> wtf :\
[17:12:46] <lenswipe> shoky, thank you
[17:13:00] <shoky> it shows question marks here
[17:13:07] <raj> Eviltwin, i wanted to make sure that the first select will ALWAYS be the before the next select within a particular div
[17:13:25] <Eviltwin> Um
[17:13:27] <raj> when collecting the values of the selects using .map() and .each()
[17:13:29] <Eviltwin> This sounds particular to your usecase
[17:13:54] <Eviltwin> They both iterate over the collections you give them in order
[17:14:01] <Eviltwin> If that's what you're asking
[17:14:17] <raj> $.map($('.mydiv>select :selected'), function(elem){return $(elem).val()})
[17:14:20] <lenswipe> shoky, yeah i have that too, but i know what you mean :)
[17:14:24] <raj> ok, cool
[17:14:31] <shoky> better now ;)   $('input[type="text"]').filter('[value="bla"]')
[17:14:35] <Eviltwin> Um... see ?map
[17:14:36] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[17:14:47] <Eviltwin> Instead of ?$.map
[17:15:11] <raj> Eviltwin, what's wrong with $.map?
[17:15:41] <Eviltwin> You end up with disgusting looking code like what you posted
[17:15:56] <Eviltwin> $('.mydiv>select :selected').map(function(elem){return $(elem).val()})
[17:16:00] <Eviltwin> Is what I was advocating
[17:16:09] <shoky> $.map is good for working on non-DOM data
[17:16:09] <lenswipe> shoky, if($('input[type="text"]').filter('[value="' + $('#typedemail').val() + '"]')){} is always true for some reason >:{
[17:16:29] <Eviltwin> I still prefer to use .map with .get for that, it feels more readable to me
[17:16:35] <Eviltwin> But I guess it's personal choice
[17:17:30] <shoky> lenswipe it's not true, it's a jquery object
[17:17:51] <shoky> check its length
[17:17:52] <lenswipe> shoky, yeah .length is always greater than 0 as well
[17:17:57] <shoky> o
[17:18:05] <shoky> fiddle me this
[17:18:08] <shoky> fiddle me that
[17:18:39] <shoky> hey raj ;)
[17:18:51] <shoky> rajy.
[17:19:11] <nights``> ok problem solved
[17:19:21] <lenswipe> shoky, if($('input[type="text"]').filter('[value="' + $('#typedemail').val() + '"]').length > 0){
[17:19:24] <lenswipe> that is always true
[17:19:43] <Eviltwin> I always advise against concatenating strings into selectors
[17:20:05] <Eviltwin> Without proper escaping
[17:20:19] <lenswipe> Eviltwin, how do i do that?
[17:20:58] <Eviltwin> You do var typedemail = $("#typedemail").val() then if($('input[type="text"]').filter(function(){ return $(this).val() == typedemail; }).length > 0{ ... } instead
[17:21:17] <RazLaptop> How do you push a helper clone to the top of div stack?
[17:22:07] <shoky> lenswipe, yes you said it's always true
[17:22:09] <shoky> then i said
[17:22:11] <shoky> fiddle me this
[17:22:25] <Eviltwin> I think a paren got eaten in there
[17:22:41] <lenswipe> thats what she said :p
[17:23:26] <shoky> o.o
[17:25:23] <lenswipe> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/ruPS8/1/
[17:25:45] <lenswipe> oddly, the opposite happens there - that if is always false for some reason on jsfiddle
[17:26:24] <shoky> huh.
[17:28:39] <Eviltwin> lenswipe: http://jsfiddle.net/ruPS8/2/
[17:29:29] <lenswipe> Eviltwin, ?
[17:29:43] <rich_> hello guys. i have a small problem with chrome and the height of an loaded iframe. i use the $iframe.load ... and within this line "	this.style.height = this.contentWindow.document.body.offsetHeight + 'px';"  , it works perfect in firefox. I click on a button, an iframe is loadet with its proper size. Within this iframe i click on something its content changed and the iframe size too. Not so in chrome. Here it always stays on the size of
[17:29:43] <rich_> the first loadet content. Can some help me out with this problem? would be very nice.
[17:30:13] <Eviltwin> lenswipe: Add the same email twice
[17:30:38] <lenswipe> thx
[17:31:43] <lenswipe> just wondering
[17:32:01] <lenswipe> is it possible for textboxes to submitt an array in the way that checkboxes can?
[17:32:05] <lenswipe> using name[]
[17:32:51] <Eviltwin> Pretty sure any form element can
[17:33:50] <lenswipe> great :)
[17:36:36] <rich_> nobody can help me?
[17:40:51] <Eviltwin> rich_: Doesn't sound like a jQuery problem to me
[17:40:52] <Eviltwin> See #javascript
[17:41:39] <rich_> ok thx. no idea anyway?
[17:43:51] <Eviltwin> Nope
[17:45:15] <rich_> ok. stupid question but how do i get into the #javascript channel? :D
[17:46:22] <Andrew131>  type /join #javascript
[17:46:46] <ansdev1> lol
[17:47:32] <raj> ##javascript
[17:47:35] <Eviltwin> Then switch back here and type /part
[17:48:02] <rich_> how to join i would know but ....Channel to enter is by invitation only
[17:48:21] <raj> it's not
[17:48:41] <raj> /join ##javascript
[17:48:59] <Andrew131> I got in just fine
[17:49:20] <ansdev1> same
[17:53:45] <fhil> Any lightweight async lib? Possibly smaller than async.js?
[18:03:13] <raj> why are all plugin pages "currently under development"
[18:03:24] <Andrew131> haha
[18:03:28] <Andrew131> Indeed
[18:03:36] <raj> and the links at the bottom almost never work
[18:06:12] <raj> any thoughts on http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/ vs. http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/query-object ?
[18:06:48] <raj> surprisingly I see no comparisons online
[18:09:21] <Eviltwin> I'm sure the cowboy prefer would say his is better
[18:15:58] <raj> Eviltwin, yeah, well, either way, I just was wondering an advantage of one over the other...or even a disadvantage
[18:40:03] <eggsby> Hi #jQuery, does anyone have any experience testing events (.on, .trigger, etc) w/ qunit? Is it mostly the same as testing anything else?
[18:42:50] <Eviltwin> eggsby: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/test
[18:43:03] <Eviltwin> eggsby: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/event.js
[18:43:15] <jrockjiggz> i'm trying to preload an image by treating it as an obj: var formLoadingImg = $('<img/>').src = DESIGN_PATH + "/images/ajax-loader.gif";   now can i simply $('#img').replace(formLoadingImg); ? i can't get it to work
[18:43:16] <Eviltwin> jQuery's Unit Tests are QUnit
[18:44:45] <eggsby> Thanks Eviltwin, i'll look through the event tests
[18:46:18] <lenswipe> dont suppose anyone knows how to fix an element vertically?
[18:46:58] <Eviltwin> lenswipe: What do you mean by that?
[18:47:16] <lenswipe> Eviltwin, my app is a timeline based app right?
[18:47:36] <lenswipe> the timeline along the top should be scrollable to the left and right but when they scroll down it should stick to the top of the viewport
[18:47:59] <Eviltwin> So... position: fixed ?
[18:48:13] <lenswipe> sort of
[18:48:28] <lenswipe> except fixed means it sticks in that position and cant be moved
[18:48:42] <lenswipe> it to stick to the top of the browser window but be scrollable horizontally
[18:49:36] <lenswipe> Eviltwin, see what im driving at?
[18:49:38] <Eviltwin> Well I'm pretty sure you're going to have to do the scrolling manually if you want it on one axis
[18:49:48] <Eviltwin> So it's a question of which axis do you want to be manual
[18:49:59] <lenswipe> ?
[18:50:18] <Eviltwin> Here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2049845/css-fixed-position-on-x-axis-but-not-y
[18:50:21] <lenswipe> can i show you?
[18:50:40] <Eviltwin> N
[18:50:41] <Eviltwin> o
[18:50:45] <lenswipe> :(
[18:58:45] <jrockjiggz> hey i'm trying to use a generated EL like a variable.. but it keeps disappearing when self-referencing itself... anyone know why? demo: http://jsfiddle.net/9uvue/
[18:59:14] <jrockjiggz> I made the el with an ID.. after if i $('#idName') its not found
[18:59:34] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/9uvue/1/
[18:59:53] <jrockjiggz> You are quick :D
[19:00:01] <Eviltwin> That's why they pay me the big bucks
[19:00:02] <jrockjiggz> thanks!
[19:01:15] <jrockjiggz> really, that was a huge help
[19:01:19] <jrockjiggz> brb
[19:01:26] <eggsby> Eviltwin: is there any reason why that is necessary?
[19:01:34] <eggsby> re: the .clone()
[19:01:55] <jrockjiggz> works perfectly
[19:03:20] <Eviltwin> eggsby: Otherwise he is basically doing generatedEl.replaceWith(generatedEl);
[19:03:37] <Eviltwin> Which amounts to basically generatedEl.insertAfter(generatedEl) followed by generatedEl.remove()
[19:03:49] <eggsby> makes sense
[19:17:16] <imsky> mmmmonday
[19:33:51] <jrockjiggz> is there better way to have a validate function return more than one kind of false return?
[19:34:39] <jrockjiggz> if(str is fail){ return false1; }else if(str < 2){ return false2; }
[19:35:03] <objNoob> yeah return an error message'
[19:35:41] <jrockjiggz> i wanted this function to be used in code.. i guess its ok to use enum status 1,2,3
[19:36:03] <objNoob> You can use an array of reasons
[19:36:17] <jrockjiggz> good idea, thx
[19:38:48] <abjorn> yo imsky
[19:39:07] <imsky> sup abjorn
[19:41:31] <abjorn> nm, learnin me sum backbone
[19:41:39] <gaius65> Is there a way directly do this in the selector $('#someid').children()
[19:41:40] <imsky> bet you are bet you are
[19:41:44] <abjorn> lol
[19:41:51] <abjorn> need to learn it for work
[19:41:55] <imsky> pshh
[19:42:00] <imsky> you wage slave
[19:42:02] <abjorn> lol
[19:42:23] <imsky> man
[19:42:29] <imsky> i got access to acm's digital library
[19:42:33] <abjorn> :o
[19:42:35] <imsky> i've been downloading research like crazy
[19:42:35] <abjorn> no idea what that is
[19:42:47] <imsky> ok it's research papers
[19:42:51] <abjorn> oh, neat
[19:42:53] <imsky> just imagine arxiv, except it's more broad
[19:42:59] <abjorn> dym
[19:43:01] <imsky> acm = association for computing machinery i think
[19:43:09] <imsky> they run siggraph and everything else
[19:43:14] <abjorn> nice
[19:43:20] <abjorn> what kinda research you downloadin?
[19:43:35] <imsky> mostly comp graphics, but then i got brave and started reading about recommendation algorithms
[19:43:47] <imsky> what a godsend, srsly
[19:43:55] <imsky> i feel like i've found water in a desert
[19:44:05] <imsky> these private research silos is where all the good shit is hiding
[19:45:27] <abjorn> :p
[19:45:34] <abjorn> did it cost you a mint to get access or something?
[19:45:42] <imsky> nope, had it all along
[19:45:44] <imsky> just didn't use it
[19:46:05] <imsky> here's a sample paper: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2124338
[19:46:36] <imsky> you can find it online elsewhere actually, but the vast majority of the papers on there are just like jstor or springer etc
[19:46:36] <abjorn> werd
[19:46:37] <abjorn> man
[19:46:41] <abjorn> that's compsci-tastic
[19:46:48] <imsky> yeah no, this is just our area, web shit
[19:46:50] <imsky> they have everything
[19:47:01] <imsky> networking, experimental comp sci stuff, operating systems, human computer interaction
[19:47:14] <imsky> http://dl.acm.org/pubs.cfm?CFID=75589962&CFTOKEN=25688411
[19:47:16] <abjorn> but
[19:47:23] <abjorn> can they teach a computer to love
[19:47:25] <imsky> ^ that's just their journals. their magazines number in the hundreds
[19:47:31] <imsky> yeah i'm pretty sure they have
[19:47:34] <abjorn> lol
[19:48:23] <imsky> you know when you want to look up a jquery problem and you google it, and you hunt and peck to get the right solution
[19:48:38] <imsky> here you just enter the search terms and someone's already worked on the problem for you, in 1985
[19:48:42] <abjorn> wtf, pandora decided that I should have an Eagles station even though I don't really like the Eagles
[19:48:48] <abjorn> it just
[19:48:49] <abjorn> made one
[19:48:53] <abjorn> for no reason
[19:48:53] <imsky> is pandora still flash?
[19:48:56] <imsky> can't remember
[19:48:56] <abjorn> nope
[19:49:00] <abjorn> backbone based now
[19:49:06] <imsky> oh good, job security
[19:49:11] <abjorn> :D
[19:49:26] <imsky> top downloaded article in acm: Scheduling Algorithms for Multiprogramming in a Hard-Real-Time Environment - 1973
[19:49:29] <imsky> 19..7.....3
[19:49:39] <abjorn> lol someone worked out a jquery problem in 1985, before the advent of javascript?
[19:49:56] <imsky> these are mostly theoretical, with broad applications
[19:50:03] <imsky> the good shit
[19:50:11] <imsky> jquery is an api, like visual foxpro or whatever
[19:50:25] <imsky> i wonder what it's gonna be like in 5 years
[19:50:32] <imsky> will we even need jquery, except for legacy browsers
[19:50:39] <abjorn> hey imsky wanna try this with me? https://bitbucket.org/spooning/
[19:50:49] <imsky> i saw it, i lold, april fools etc etc
[19:50:53] <abjorn> a
[19:50:54] <abjorn> ya
[19:51:11] <abjorn> pair programming, made interesting
[19:51:21] <imsky> lol ye
[19:51:29] <abjorn> I mean, it can't work any WORSE than pair programming
[19:51:55] <imsky> i love working solo. pair programming is like cattle farming to me
[19:52:00] <imsky> done to beasts of burden
[19:52:42] <imsky> i got referred to this company to apply for a job (lol) so i went to their site
[19:52:47] <imsky> open plan office, lots of pair programming
[19:52:53] <imsky> didn't even bother to check what tech they use
[19:53:10] <NivenHuH> hey all..  http://jsfiddle.net/AZqq3/  i can't seem to figure out why .submit() isn't sending a put request
[19:54:19] <imsky> http://amundsen.com/examples/put-delete-forms/
[19:54:35] <imsky> i.e. browsers don't support put
[19:54:37] <abjorn> ^ put/delete not supported
[19:54:46] <abjorn> make an ajax request manually
[19:54:54] <imsky> herpity derpity
[19:56:28] <abjorn> imsky: Yeah, I think pair programming is silly. I mean, talking to your coworkers about a problem and everything is great, but it's still more productive for both programming to be working individually when not discussing an issue.
[19:57:00] <NivenHuH> weird.. why the hell was this ever working
[19:57:05] <NivenHuH> lol
[19:57:20] <abjorn> because you were high on opium
[19:57:25] <imsky> abjorn: these things are usually just religion anyway
[19:57:27] <NivenHuH> hah it's not my code

[19:58:23] <abjorn> imsky: We're all "agile" here but pair programming is a "what? what's that? why would I do that?" round these parts
[19:58:34] <abjorn> I wouldn't be surprised
[19:58:39] <abjorn> I'm not voting against that
[19:58:40] <imsky> i put $50 on 2 years
[19:58:41] <abjorn> I ain't no sucka
[19:58:57] <imsky> lol it does warm my heart that bootstrap is 2x node
[19:59:08] <abjorn> ?
[19:59:14] <imsky> 2x watchers
[19:59:22] <imsky> bootstrap: 25k, node: 13k
[20:00:01] <imsky> hey how about a countdown until github is rewritten in node AND using bootstrap?
[20:00:03] <abjorn> oh, nice
[20:00:06] <abjorn> lol
[20:00:07] <abjorn> oh lawd
[20:00:16] <abjorn> float black nav bars everywhere
[20:00:22] <imsky> mmm
[20:00:32] <abjorn> oh, sorry, they'll be multicolored by that point
[20:00:36] <imsky> jquery's the only non-corporate project i think
[20:00:37] <abjorn> you know, the odd red or green
[20:00:38] <imsky> in the top 5
[20:00:59] <imsky> bootstrap: tw, node: joyent, rails: 37signals, and html5bp: paul irish's mafia cousins
[20:01:13] <abjorn> mafia cousins? lol
[20:01:25] <imsky> how can people use bp so much
[20:02:17] <abjorn> *shrug* I mean, I use it, but a very...stripped version of it.
[20:02:39] <abjorn> imsky let's spoon

[20:03:10] <imsky> man i wonder how much of github is just macshit
[20:03:23] <abjorn> all of it
[20:03:26] <imsky> just san francisco going wild with macbooks
[20:03:43] <imsky> i dunno like i remember old school hackers
[20:03:55] <imsky> they're all into customization and screwing the man over
[20:04:04] <imsky> but i see photos of these new hacker conferences
[20:04:10] <imsky> a vast sea of gray macbooks
[20:04:15] <imsky> maybe with a sticker or something
[20:04:29] <imsky> kinda depressing to look at
[20:04:38] <abjorn> that is
[20:04:40] <abjorn> very disappointing
[20:04:50] <abjorn> especially considering how easy macbooks are to hack
[20:04:57] <abjorn> and not in the cool way
[20:04:59] <abjorn> in the bad way
[20:05:35] <imsky> lol i dunno, it is freaking freebsd
[20:05:45] <abjorn> only part of it :)
[20:06:10] <abjorn> if it was a single kernel with just freebsd yeah it'd be a different story
[20:07:11] <imsky> http://www.flickr.com/photos/blank22763/6208280969/in/pool-1281998@N21/
[20:07:14] <imsky> my soul weeps
[20:07:35] <abjorn> iphones and macbooks errywhere
[20:07:39] <imsky> windows has like 92% market share
[20:07:52] <abjorn> I remember that first node conf, they posted the 360 view of the audience and all
[20:07:55] <abjorn> and it was just
[20:07:57] <imsky> the future of the web is on blurry text shiny screen pieces of shit
[20:07:58] <abjorn> a sea of macbooks
[20:07:58] <abjorn> and like
[20:08:01] <abjorn> one dell
[20:08:07] <abjorn> the one lonely dell
[20:08:09] <imsky> lol
[20:08:27] <imsky> how can people use em in sunlight
[20:08:31] <abjorn> poor guy must've had a hard time running node back then, before it played well with windows
[20:08:34] <imsky> it just turns into a mirror
[20:09:18] <imsky> lol i love the futility of this one
[20:09:20] <imsky> http://www.flickr.com/photos/blank22763/6208313607/in/pool-1281998@N21/
[20:09:34] <abjorn> the futility?
[20:09:34] <imsky> hello i see you have a slightly larger macbook, did you notice the swords and stickers on mine?
[20:09:41] <abjorn> lol
[20:09:49] <imsky> i'm an individual dammit!
[20:09:50] <abjorn> who's that on the right, i forget
[20:09:53] <abjorn> oh i see
[20:09:55] <abjorn> chris williams
[20:09:58] <imsky> oh shit that's brendan eich
[20:10:04] <imsky> i didn't even check the caption
[20:10:04] <abjorn> LOL did you just notice that?
[20:10:08] <abjorn> psh
[20:10:12] <abjorn> i knew without seeing the caption
[20:10:15] <abjorn> that makes me cooler, right?
[20:10:18] <imsky> nope
[20:10:20] <imsky> makes you creepy
[20:10:20] <abjorn> o
[20:10:33] <abjorn> nah, i just seen a couple videos with him before
[20:10:34] <imsky> ok ok hold on
[20:10:46] <imsky> i know ejohn is a macbook user too
[20:10:53] <abjorn> yeah
[20:10:53] <imsky> but i forgive him his sins
[20:10:57] <abjorn> lol
[20:11:32] <abjorn> I forgive ryah for being a macfag, because I can tell deep down inside he yearns for true *nix
[20:12:06] <imsky> you ever read the unix haters handbook
[20:12:31] <imsky> lol it just hit me
[20:13:00] <imsky> osx is multiuser by design...so why don't they all just set up a powerful mac pro and use some shitty android tablets as thin clients
[20:13:05] <imsky> instead of lugging around $2000 laptops
[20:13:14] <imsky> macfags fail at unix itself
[20:13:24] <abjorn> hahaha
[20:13:36] <abjorn> MULTIUSER, HOW DOES IT WORK?
[20:13:37] <imsky> they'd get their precious graphics too
[20:13:40] <imsky> yeah seriously
[20:13:45] <abjorn> fuckin magic
[20:13:47] <pifantastic> imsky: let's avoid the f word please.
[20:13:55] <abjorn> no
[20:13:56] <imsky> ...
[20:14:02] <imsky> let's learn to read please
[20:14:21] <abjorn> all of my what
[20:14:23] <pifantastic> ahem, the fa* word
[20:14:31] <imsky> ...
[20:14:38] <abjorn> lol
[20:14:47] <imsky> holy shit what has the internet become
[20:15:09] <abjorn> but macfag is totally a different thing
[20:16:14] <abjorn> imsky i cannot concentrate on this backbone fundamentals bullshit, WHY IS LEARNING SO BOORIIINNGG
[20:16:20] <imsky> it's pretty easy brah
[20:16:28] <imsky> i guess i found it easy because i already built backbone
[20:16:29] <abjorn> but learning is borriiinngg

[20:17:07] <abjorn> my gaming rig
[20:17:23] <imsky> lol
[20:17:28] <abjorn> and I'm going to run windows and play video games and be like "HAHAHAHAHA YOU GUYS CAN'T DO THIS CAN YOU?"
[20:17:44] <imsky> "check it out, i can open it and stop the fan while it's running"
[20:17:53] <abjorn> I can't do that
[20:17:56] <imsky> psh
[20:18:00] <abjorn> well, i mean
[20:18:00] <imsky> i'll teach you
[20:18:00] <abjorn> i could

[20:25:23] <FelipeS>  might get it to work.
[20:25:28] <imsky> oh gotcha
[20:27:27] <NivenHuH> just a random factoid… apparently older versions of safari supported method=put on forms for ajax, but newer versions do not
[20:27:39] <Eviltwin> That is not true
[20:27:56] <Eviltwin> For AJAX it supports any method
[20:28:10] <imsky> holy crap
[20:28:14] <NivenHuH> i'm comparing between safari 5.2 (does not work)  and 5.1.3 (does work)
[20:28:16] <imsky> you read this channel at all times?
[20:28:38] <Eviltwin> NivenHuH: http://ci.azich.org/tests/methods/
[20:29:13] <Eviltwin> imsky: Intermittently
[20:29:48] <imsky> i'm being watched
[20:29:50] <NivenHuH> Eviltwin well, clearly that test suite is making up stuff :P
[20:32:13] <NivenHuH> Eviltwin oh i see.. using the ajax call works okay, but submitting from a form with a PUT does not.  i think my statement was slightly off
[20:32:49] <Eviltwin> Um, you said AJAX
[20:34:06] <NivenHuH> right.. in my circumstance i'm using the rails jquery driver which still uses the native form submit element but does it in an ajax request..  so i just said ajax.. but i guess technically it's the form still doing the submit
[20:34:41] <imsky> the rails jquery driver
[20:34:57] <imsky> does that sound like what i think it sounds like
[20:35:06] <Eviltwin> NivenHuH: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/165779/are-the-put-delete-head-etc-methods-available-in-most-web-browsers
[20:35:56] <Eviltwin> Look at the first answer
[20:36:51] <NivenHuH> right.. i think it'll be better for me to convert this old code over to just relying on .ajax instead of the ujs helpers that rails has
[20:37:17] <NivenHuH> it appears that it worked on older safari because put/delete were supported once upon a time in the html5 spec, but was removed (and is now removed in safari 5.2)
[20:58:01] <infid> i there a difference between on('keypress', f) and .keypress(cb)?
[20:58:43] <imsky> uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yes
[21:08:18] <Eviltwin> imsky: Enlighten the man
[21:08:30] <imsky> what time is it
[21:08:43] <Eviltwin> 11pm here
[21:08:47] <NivenHuH> beer-o-clock
[21:08:52] <imsky> i think that guy left
[21:08:54] <Eviltwin> whiskey-o-clock here
[21:09:05] <Eviltwin> He didn't quit or part
[21:09:06] <infid> nope i'm here
[21:09:10] <Eviltwin> SEE?
[21:09:16] <imsky> oh you are
[21:09:26] <infid> i figured since he typed a long 'uhhhh...' he was still thinking
[21:09:30] <imsky> well .keypress is basically .bind("keypress")
[21:09:35] <imsky> and .on is .on
[21:09:41] <imsky> so look em up in api
[21:09:53] <infid> ok
[21:10:00] <Eviltwin> But .bind is basically a limited syntax of .on
[21:10:03] <infid> so .on is the preferred way in 1.7
[21:10:30] <Eviltwin> And actually .keypress calls .on directly, not .bind
[21:10:37] <Eviltwin> Just using it's bind-style syntax
[21:11:03] <imsky> pshh eviltwin
[21:11:08] <imsky> you read the source again
[21:11:31] <imsky> and yet the api
[21:11:33] <imsky> "This method is a shortcut for .bind("keypress", handler) in the first two variations, and .trigger("keypress") in the third."
[21:11:44] <imsky> WHOM DO I TRUST
[21:11:57] <Eviltwin> Me, obviously
[21:12:04] <imsky> no stupid
[21:12:06] <imsky> i trust the source
[21:13:08] <imsky> this.on( name, null, data, fn ) :
[21:13:13] <imsky> well shuck my corn
[21:13:16] <imsky> the docs is wrong
[21:13:24] <Eviltwin> Why would it not call .on directly?
[21:13:39] <imsky> who are you asking
[21:13:42] <imsky> are you asking god?
[21:14:29] <Eviltwin> No, silly, I'm not asking myself.
[21:14:51] <imsky> yeah nerds with god complexes are totally uncommon
[21:15:02] <imsky> i'm surprised you made it
[21:15:06] <NivenHuH> i thought everything went through .on now
[21:15:07] <NivenHuH> ?
[21:18:13] <pifantastic> NivenHuH: right
[21:18:42] <gerriprice> is there a way to load scripts from another server?
[21:19:15] <pifantastic> gerriprice: <script src="other.server.com/script.js"></script>
[21:19:39] <gerriprice> $.getScript doesn't inject a script tag then right?
[21:19:49] <gerriprice> $.getScript() that is
[21:20:38] <unCork> gerriprice: you can load scripts from another server with $.getScript
[21:20:57] <unCork> unless you have a csp rule that prevents you
[21:22:42] <rabbi1> i am using 2 datepicker in a single page, but only one works not the other... any suggestions ?
[21:23:12] <simtsit> i want to add jquery.kwicks but it's a bit complicate.
[21:23:54] <gerriprice> uncork: a csp rule on the browser or the other server?
[21:30:32] <Cork> gerriprice: csp set by the server for the site
[21:37:02] <someprimetime> http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ in that plugin, is it possible to not show the search input box?
[21:37:12] <someprimetime> i just want a styled select menu bascially
[21:37:17] <someprimetime> basically*
[22:01:25] <nsanden> hi guys, i dont remember where but ive seen websites with a menu of plain links and a more link at the end (since they couldnt fit all the links in it). the more link would open a sort of submenu. any tips on how to do that or what id search for
[22:02:21] <nsanden> i guess it would just be a dropdown menu with only 1 dropdown?
[22:08:03] <Cork> nsanden: not sure what your asking actually
[22:08:26] <Cork> nsanden: sounds like a farly simple list structure
[22:11:06] <nsanden> i could see having sublist hidden till you click 'more'
[22:11:21] <nsanden> but presentation sounds tricky
[22:41:32] <westg> is there any reference guide to conceptual examples for doing something like a realtime feed and live event binding in jQuery?
[22:42:18] <indspenceable> not that i know of, but perhaps it exists
[22:43:21] <indspenceable> live event bindings = adding new elements to page and binding events to them?
[22:43:28] <westg> yeah
[22:43:44] <indspenceable> just use the delegate version of on()
[22:43:46] <westg> I know the basic conecept but I was wondering where I could see some really well commented examples
[22:44:03] <westg> that's it?
[22:44:05] <Eviltwin> westg: Usually if you search for some combination of two generic and distinct concepts like that
[22:44:14] <Eviltwin> You're going to have a hard time finding examples
[22:44:21] <Eviltwin> If possible, look for the pieces you need first
[22:44:30] <Eviltwin> Or get specific and small enough for us to actually build you examples
[22:46:45] <indspenceable> yeah. or, give it a shot, and ask about the specific things that go wrong / you can't figure out
[22:46:48] <indspenceable> :)
[22:48:21] <westg> My plan is to build a custom feed for each client that has access to many 'documents' from a document oriented database. these documents are created when one user registered to the same 'interest' creates a post and then that is sent over socket.io (websocket -> flash socket -> xhr etc.) which is then emitted to all clients with the same 'interest' feed. This data is then immediately added to
[22:48:21] <westg> the database with a timestamp. I understand how the transport between clients will work. I basically am at the point to where I can get the data to a cleint but since I haven't done a lot of client-side javascript I'm not sure how the new posts will get added to the client's view
[22:48:33] <westg> I'm working with node.js btw, if that makes a difference
[22:49:19] <westg> jQuery seems really awesome for making stuff like this easier to do but I just want to be sure I understand how to achieve what I'm thinking about in my head
[22:49:31] <westg> on the client side
[22:49:32] <indspenceable> ok, cool. how do you think you would do it?
[22:49:50] <westg> append a div on top of the feed
[22:49:58] <westg> with the new post
[22:50:06] <indspenceable> right.
[22:50:10] <westg> but that's about as much detail as I'm aware of
[22:50:15] <indspenceable> ok
[22:50:17] <westg> is there anything else that I should know?
[22:50:22] <westg> something that I'm missing?
[22:50:26] <indspenceable> jquery == magic
[22:50:42] <indspenceable> so the way that on() works is you can call something along the lines of
[22:50:43] <westg> it feels like I'm oversimplifying it haha
[22:51:12] <indspenceable> $('.container').on('click', 'div', function() { … })
[22:51:35] <indspenceable> what that means is on a click, on any div inside .container, do that function
[22:52:30] <indspenceable> div, in this case, is actually a selector. so you might do something like:
[22:53:24] <indspenceable> $('.all-posts').on('click', '.post', function() { socket.emit('like', {post: $(this).attr('post_id')})})
[22:53:35] <indspenceable> just to guess some functionality
[22:54:08] <indspenceable> do you follow that?
[22:54:13] <westg> yes, that makes sense
[22:54:19] <indspenceable> cool
[22:54:20] <westg> it's very clean
[22:54:22] <westg> awesome
[22:54:27] <indspenceable> so what's cool about it
[22:54:33] <indspenceable> is since you bind the event to the container
[22:54:44] <indspenceable> it works for all .post within the container now, and any that get added later.
[22:55:34] <westg> ok so suppose someone adds a comment to an existing post that is within the other client's view (say latest 10 posts)
[22:55:45] <westg> how do I update that old comment?
[22:55:54] <westg> since it has already been appended
[22:55:57] <indspenceable> right
[22:56:33] <Cork> westg: you need to either have a pulling solution, where you request the server for updates
[22:56:39] <indspenceable> in the callback for that message, you'll want to find the post their talking about, and presumably, append some content to that
[22:56:49] <Cork> westg: or use websocket
[22:56:59] <f0rkn1ght> is json fast loading ?
[22:57:00] <f0rkn1ght> unlike ajax ?
[22:57:03] <westg> via the post_id right attr right
[22:57:15] <indspenceable> yeah, that's how i would do it
[22:57:16] <westg> I just need a way to reference the existing post
[22:57:18] <Cork> f0rkn1ght: json is a data format, its used over ajax most of the time
[22:57:19] <westg> awesome
[22:57:31] <westg> jQuery is sweet
[22:57:37] <westg> makes life so much easier
[22:57:38] <indspenceable> <div postid="1923">blah blah blah</div>
[22:57:54] <f0rkn1ght> ah Cork wel it takes a min for reg ajax requests to load will it speed it up any ?
[22:57:55] <Cork> indspenceable, westg: use the data- namespace though
[22:58:19] <westg> data namespace?
[22:58:21] <Cork> f0rkn1ght: whats regular ajax?
[22:58:31] <Cork> westg: data-* is reserved since html5
[22:58:43] <indspenceable> oo. that's good to know.
[22:58:49] <Cork> westg: if you add arbitary data to the element it should be that prefix
[22:58:57] <Cork> so data-postid
[22:59:03] <westg> ah
[22:59:05] <westg> I see
[22:59:16] <indspenceable> yep. do that
[22:59:18] <Cork> and jquery have a special function to access it too
[22:59:20] <Cork> ?.data
[22:59:21] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[22:59:41] <Cork> it doesn't set data to it though, but it reads it
[23:00:20] <westg> I was actually thinking about sticking the databases objectid (unique to each document) into that field. would that be a security issue?
[23:00:42] <Cork> westg: ajax is just the use of javascript generated updates of the page, you can even use an iframe to grab new data and it would still be called ajax
[23:01:22] <Cork> westg: if you mean a row index, no its quite common
[23:01:23] <indspenceable> i don't see why, as long as you confirm owernship on the backend
[23:02:11] <westg> basically the unique identifier of that post in the database would be set as the data-post_id on the client's page
[23:02:26] <indspenceable> that's fine.
[23:02:41] <westg> yeah I'm guessing it would be useless to the client anyway
[23:02:46] <indspenceable> yep
[23:03:03] <indspenceable> it's the default routing scheme for rails, if it was a big security issue that probably wouldn't be the case =p
[23:04:13] <westg> client-side validation is basically only to help guide the good guys right (eg people not injecting POST data)?
[23:04:24] <westg> is that the idea of server-side and client-side validation?
[23:05:03] <indspenceable> the idea is never trust the client, full stop.
[23:05:12] <westg> true that
[23:05:22] <tw2113> clients have cooties

[23:12:14] <westg> well, thanks alot indspenceable. i appreciate your help and will be back tomorrow. Goodnight everyone!
[23:29:04] <pr0ton> does anybody know of a jquery autocomplete plugin that lets me define the rendering of an element?
[23:29:18] <pr0ton> like let me dictate what it's html content should look like, instead of imposing something?
[23:29:29] <pr0ton> there is a jquery hack to override _renderItem
[23:29:44] <pr0ton> but i was curious if any plugin supports that out of the box
[23:35:38] <raj> I have a JSON formatted object, how can I make query parameters out of it? I've got bbq included, but not sure how to go from JSON to query params
[23:36:23] <jrockjiggz> is it possible to return an array like:    return array('message','id');  im getting array not defined
[23:37:05] <westg> you can't refer to an array like that I think
[23:37:50] <Cork> jrockjiggz: return ['message', 'id'];
[23:38:16] <Cork> raj: your using it for ajax or what?
[23:38:44] <raj> well, first I'd like to set window.location.href
[23:39:09] <Cork> ok so you want to append the params to the current url?
[23:39:17] <innociv> http://pastebin.com/58TUyVBw Why would I be getting an SOP error when i'm adhearing to SOP rules?  They are both http, same domain, same port.
[23:39:23] <raj> Cork, yep
[23:39:29] <Cork> ?.params @ raj
[23:39:31] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".params" in jQuery Docs.
[23:39:35] <raj> jQuery.param.querystring(window.location.href, 'a=3&newValue=100');
[23:39:37] <Cork> ?.param @ raj
[23:39:37] <bot-t> raj, jQuery.param(obj): Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[23:39:58] <raj> oh, for rizzle?
[23:40:22] <raj> and then just use bbq to update it?
[23:40:33] <Cork> raj: never used bbq
[23:40:47] <raj> Cork, have you used jquery-query-plugin?
[23:41:15] <Cork> no
[23:41:28] <raj> this one actually http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/query-object
[23:41:29] <raj> oh ok
[23:41:41] <Cork> never seen the need to
[23:42:05] <raj> gotcha
[23:42:25] <raj> i'm going GET heavy, so it's coming in handy
[23:42:29] <raj> or it should, I think :)
[23:42:44] <jovrtn> i went GET heavy on your mom
[23:43:02] <Cork> raj: why do you need to parse the current pages url to go get heavy?
[23:43:48] <raj> well, the get parameters change with changes in selection boxes
[23:44:19] <Cork> so you reload the entire page each time you change a selectbox??
[23:44:27] <raj> so although it doesn't change the URL using ajax, I want to simulate how it would be without js
[23:44:30] <Xotix> Can anyone help me on that? http://tinyw.in/wkaX It's about a paste event in safari
[23:44:47] <raj> Cork, doing window.locatoin.href doesn't reload the page, right?
[23:44:54] <Cork> it does
[23:44:58] <raj> oh crap
[23:45:08] <Cork> any modifications to window.location reloads the page
[23:45:12] <raj> shit
[23:45:22] <Cork> ?mdc pushState @ raj
[23:45:23] <bot-t> raj, Manipulating the browser history - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[23:45:28] <raj> so I can't add query parameters to the URL?
[23:45:33] <Xotix> Cork, isn't there a way which doesn't reload the page? I thoug hi'veread this somewhere
[23:45:35] <Cork> no
[23:45:44] <Cork> raj: you can push updates to the history though
[23:45:54] <raj> i'm not concerned about the history
[23:45:59] <Cork> Xotix: i just linked to it
[23:46:05] <raj> i'm trying to make sure users can bookmark the page as it is
[23:46:13] <Cork> raj: it modifyes the displayed url too
[23:46:43] <Cork> but its window.history.pushState/replaceState not location
[23:46:47] <Cork> see the link above
[23:46:51] <Cork> (no ie support though)
[23:46:56] <raj> damnit
[23:47:01] <raj> damnitdamnitdamnit
[23:47:14] <Cork> if you need it support you need to use hashes
[23:47:15] <raj> i just spent a lot of time trying to change all my posts to gets
[23:47:33] <raj> so that a user can revisit the page as it is, and share the page
[23:48:29] <Cork> raj: thats why twitter has the domain/#/url structure of its urls
[23:48:51] <raj> i don't use twitter, I'm not sure what you mean
[23:49:10] <Cork> they put the path behind a hash mark
[23:49:29] <Cork> www.example.com/#/this/is/the/full/url
[23:49:38] <raj> i see
[23:49:43] <Cork> then js grabs the hash
[23:49:55] <Cork> and requests the real page
[23:49:56] <raj> looks like I'm gonna have to do that
[23:50:08] <raj> thanks for that Cork
[23:50:09] <Cork> you could do it as a fallback for ie
[23:50:16] <Cork> and use pushState for the rest
[23:50:41] <raj> you don't think I should just keep it consistent with the hash for all browsers?
[23:51:00] <Cork> you would have to demand js for that to work
[23:51:09] <raj> oh
[23:51:15] <Cork> and no i don't think thats good
[23:51:22] <Cork> raj: have a look at https://github.com/balupton/history.js
[23:52:31] <neersighted> Can someone please look over a bit of jQuery I wrote (first try at it :D), and see if I did it right?
[23:52:58] <neersighted> https://github.com/ClouDev/cloudev.github.com/blob/master/index.html
[23:53:42] <coldhead> that looks very nice, neersighted
[23:53:44] <coldhead> good job
[23:53:50] <neersighted> Thanks
[23:54:16] <neersighted> seems to work good enough, just thought I might see if it could be improved
[23:54:45] <coldhead> it reads like you've been writing jQuery for years
[23:55:31] <coldhead> some people would condense lines 35 and 36 and not bother with the var but that's hardly worth mentioning
[23:56:48] <raj> Cork, thank you, this looks extremely useful
[23:57:46] <neersighted> thank's :D
[23:58:13] <Eartz> good morning
[23:58:50] <neersighted> Do jQuery selectors work just like CSS selectors?
[23:59:15] <coldhead> exactly, neersighted
[23:59:17] <coldhead> that's the point
[23:59:24] <coldhead> css and a few extras
[23:59:25] <justicefries> ::D
[23:59:54] <coldhead> well intuited
