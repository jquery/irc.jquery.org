[00:41:24] <cattleFraud> relipse: is that even a jquery issue? can't find any double click handler in the code
[00:42:35] <cattleFraud> relipse: let me guess, you want the textfield to replace the text, right?
[00:47:54] <AQEEL> hi channel
[00:48:44] <cattleFraud> hey
[00:54:23] <AngryAsian> http://jsfiddle.net/sunchips/KTHan/2/
[00:55:08] <AngryAsian> if I replace data[i].parent with findParent(data,data[i].parent)
[00:55:26] <AngryAsian> the page explodes
[00:55:27] <AngryAsian> any thoughts?
[00:59:09] <cattleFraud> explodes?
[01:00:15] <AngryAsian> try it
[01:01:09] <cattleFraud> ok
[01:01:55] <cattleFraud> I see now
[01:02:08] <cattleFraud> looks like a circular reference
[01:02:16] <cattleFraud> and memory leak
[01:03:06] <AngryAsian> I dont see it. It's clearly not an infinite loop.
[01:03:13] <AngryAsian> so memory leak? if so how?
[01:06:22] <cattleFraud> wait, isn't "parent" a reserved word??
[01:06:35] <AngryAsian> is it? Let me check.
[01:07:42] <AngryAsian> http://www.javascripter.net/faq/reserved.htm says it isn't but it should be. I guess let me try avoiding using that variable name
[01:08:01] <cattleFraud> ok sure
[01:10:43] <cattleFraud> it is an infinite loop. I ran it again.. and...
[01:11:20] <AngryAsian> data.length = 3. it will run at most 9 times (realistically at most 6) times
[01:11:28] <cattleFraud> ff asked me if I wanted to stop the script, so i did, the table had like 800 new rows
[01:11:46] <cattleFraud> ok, maybe not 800
[01:12:00] <AngryAsian> oh really? Interesting.
[01:12:27] <AngryAsian> data[i].parent I haven't changed I changed the parent variable in the findParent function
[01:12:32] <cattleFraud> http://jsfiddle.net/whLPh/
[01:12:33] <AngryAsian> let me change that as well
[01:13:03] <cattleFraud> yeah, that's what I just did
[01:13:53] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/PQVQt/12/  cloning without values doesn't work. any help ?
[01:16:58] <rabbi1> adding .val(''); will only trigger the 'clone it'  for first time...
[01:17:10] <angryasian_> I'm back, It broke my webchat as well
[01:19:39] <cattleFraud> angryasian: yeah, still trying to fix this
[01:21:35] <cattleFraud> angryasian: fixed it. You forgot for(var i=0
[01:21:52] <cattleFraud> angryasian_: you had for(i=0
[01:21:55] <cattleFraud> :)
[01:22:26] <angryasian_> are you kidding me?
[01:22:31] <cattleFraud> nope
[01:22:31] <angryasian_> THAT was the problem?
[01:24:13] <angryasian_> remembering for loop syntax across python, java, javascript, php... >_<  Thanks cattleFraud!
[01:24:24] <cattleFraud> np
[01:26:10] <cattleFraud> rabbil: ok, looking into this
[01:30:28] <cattleFraud> rabbi1:  I fixed it: http://jsfiddle.net/PQVQt/16/
[01:30:59] <cattleFraud> rabbi1: You had a <div> tag in there that was making your parent call all whack
[01:31:36] <rabbi1> cattleFraud: what was fixed ? have no idea
[01:32:08] <rabbi1> input value is still cloned with the input field
[01:32:25] <molavy> hi
[01:32:38] <cattleFraud> you said it only worked the first time, I thought thats' what the problem was..
[01:32:53] <molavy> i want using mvc library with jquery,
[01:33:04] <molavy> which one you prefer?
[01:33:16] <molavy> is backbone.js good choice?
[01:34:03] <cattleFraud> rabbi1:  so what are you trying to achieve then?
[01:35:01] <rabbi1> cattleFraud: sorry, my  mistake... actually jsfiddle is just a mockup. in live project i don have the first time, second time problem... :) i need that prevent default. ok all aside... i just want to make the field value empty before clone... i guess i could do it with $cloned.find(input: type="text").val(''); ... but is there any other easy way to achieve it, or should i do the above mentioned way only ?
[01:39:18] <cattleFraud> rabbi1: I would have done it differently, but you'll be fine
[01:39:18] <rabbi1> cattleFraud: http://jsfiddle.net/PQVQt/21/ this is what is to be achieved... but say nobody has idea what type of input fields are to be cloned... .that's it
[01:40:52] <rabbi1> but here i have mentioned input type, but i like to skip that and empty the value for what ever the input type is... if not, i have to find each and every type of input fields and then mention it...
[01:43:31] <cattleFraud> rabbi1: well you could place them in a div, and then (assuming they're all inputs) and use the * selector ?
[01:43:58] <cattleFraud> I don't know, it looks like maybe you rushed this all
[01:44:41] <rabbi1> any idea why this  var $cloned = $('.contacts').first().clone().val(''); doesn't work ?
[01:46:20] <cattleFraud> because you're doing 2 separate things
[01:47:08] <rabbi1> $cloned = $cloned.val(''); ?
[01:47:27] <cattleFraud> var $cloned=$(".contacts").first().clone(); var cval=$cloned.val(); (see if that works)
[01:49:38] <rabbi1> cattleFraud: nope /...
[01:49:46] <cattleFraud> damn
[01:51:33] <cattleFraud> how about $('.contacts').first("input:text").clone();
[01:52:32] <rabbi1> cattleFraud: oops, that will again only clone input type text
[01:52:52] <rabbi1> here, i have all input types..
[01:53:24] <Lucky--> http://css2less.cc/ uh yes thx to whoever made this.
[01:53:49] <rabbi1> and more over it's html5. i have type = email, num, phone etc
[01:53:56] <cattleFraud> $('.contacts").first("*").clone();
[01:54:30] <cattleFraud> just a wild guess man
[01:54:58] <pandu101> hey guys - Im looking for a plugin that can help me write numbers in the indian number format. Eg 1,000,000 is written as 10,00,000.
[01:55:06] <rabbi1> nope, that's not the way,, not working
[01:56:13] <cattleFraud> rabbi1: this is annoying me, let me try something out
[01:56:25] <rabbi1> :) relax, no issues
[02:05:24] <cattleFraud> rabbi1: ok, try this   $(".contacts input").first().clone();
[02:06:05] <rabbi1> that's again only for input right ?anyway will try
[02:06:26] <cattleFraud> well that should cover all of them besides select and textarea
[02:07:07] <rabbi1> hmm, that's the prob, that doesn't suit my requirement. tried it....
[02:07:16] <cattleFraud> I'm sure some jQuery guru has a very simple and concise way to do that
[02:07:24] <rabbi1> i am giving it a try with an empty().. checking it out
[02:12:17] <cattleFraud> rabbi1: $(".container *").first().clone().val();
[02:15:03] <cattleFraud> rabbi1:  i meant $(".contacts *").first().clone().val('');
[02:15:16] <rabbi1> cattleFraud: got that, cheking it out
[02:16:24] <rabbi1> cattleFraud: guess we are close, http://jsfiddle.net/PQVQt/24/
[02:19:35] <cattleFraud> it works with textareas http://jsfiddle.net/jUcbZ/1/
[02:20:29] <cattleFraud> good luck rabbi1  I gotta go to bed
[02:20:43] <rabbi1> yeah, thanx good ngith
[02:20:46] <rabbi1> *night
[02:33:14] <cattleFraud> rabbi1: http://jsfiddle.net/jUcbZ/9/
[02:34:32] <rabbi1> cattleFraud: great!
[02:34:33] <rabbi1> :)
[02:35:01] <cattleFraud> that would've bugged the crap out of me all night. :p
[02:35:47] <raj> if I .click() a hidden element, does it unhide the element or parent element?
[02:36:21] <rabbi1> cattleFraud: yeah, but it's working for textarea, not for input
[02:36:28] <rabbi1> u also got the same problem ?
[02:37:04] <rabbi1> time for you to sleep... carry on take some rest
[02:38:18] <cattleFraud> rabbi1:  yeah, it doesn't clear out the text for input type='text' ...
[02:39:49] <cattleFraud> rabbi1: now it works. http://jsfiddle.net/jUcbZ/14/
[02:41:10] <rabbi1> cattleFraud: yeah, good .... crazy, will have understand this .. thanks a lot ! have a good sleep then
[02:41:23] <cattleFraud> allrighty
[03:00:24] <Azrael_-> hi
[03:00:31] <Azrael_-> i want to understand how jquery constructs this parameter when performing an ajax-request: callback=jQuery17207581623412708908_1356776909371   can you give me a hint?
[03:02:45] <raj> that's so wack, .click() unhides elements
[03:06:02] <raj> actually it's bubbling up
[03:06:08] <raj> my bad jquery
[03:07:29] <raj> I want a parent element clickable, but not to be triggered when its child element is clicked
[03:07:32] <raj> how can i do that?
[03:09:24] <angryasian_> on the click event of the child. do event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropogation
[03:11:01] <raj> yeah, i was trying to approach that ass backwards
[03:11:02] <raj> thank you
[03:11:43] <angryasian_> no problem.
[03:12:59] <trinadh> raj: or do a return false;
[03:14:22] <raj> angryasian_, why ev.preventDefault()?
[03:24:44] <trinadh> raj: preventDefault() is not really required in your case. stopPropagation() is enough.
[03:30:56] <apple1004> Hi All.
[03:33:25] <BinaryKitten> raj you could also check the event target
[03:33:44] <BinaryKitten> if (event.target !== this) { return; } in the parent event
[03:34:19] <BinaryKitten> (if you don't have the child already having it's own click event for other reasons)
[03:40:37] <MaddinXx> hi everyone. I'm having some trouble with jQuery and a plugin in IE8 - according to width/height calculation (BackStretch). I know it's best to ask the dev itself - I've done that already... the website is: http://fronty.ch/ as you can see in modern browsers there are 3 boxes on the main page (each filled with a bg image by the plugin)
[03:41:36] <MaddinXx> however in IE8 it doesn't initialize by default (window has to be resized) (but that's probably really something by the plugin) - but it also doesn't fill the blocks (e.g. not set correct width/height)
[03:42:47] <MaddinXx> anyone has an idea what should be checked if jquery's width/height doesn't work correct? e.g. min-/max-width and other CSS properties=
[03:44:54] <raj> thanks BinaryKitten
[03:56:17] <AQEEL> hi everyone
[03:56:35] <sheilablackrose> hello
[03:58:03] <Schrostfutz> hi, is there a way to wait until the callback of getJSON finished?
[04:01:25] <gvo> If you need to do something at that point, include it at the end of the success: callback.
[04:07:43] <Schrostfutz> gvo: im retrieving data from a server and need to wait until the data is there
[04:09:06] <gvo> That's what the success callback is for.
[04:09:44] <gvo> The data has been transferred and then the callback is executed.
[04:13:45] <Schrostfutz> ah, okay, thanks
[04:19:44] <raj> how can I tell if the end of a string contains 'xyz' ?
[04:19:51] <raj> as in, the last 3 characters
[04:21:25] <Schrostfutz> if("xyz" == string.slice(string.length -3, string.length)) fooBar();
[04:22:13] <raj> string.length - 1 for the upper limit, no?
[04:22:29] <raj> it doesn't include it?
[04:22:41] <Schrostfutz> no, the slice doesnt include the last one
[04:22:46] <raj> aah, ok
[04:22:48] <raj> thank you very much
[04:22:54] <Schrostfutz> no problem
[04:24:35] <Schrostfutz> can i apply jquery selectors to selfbuilt objects? something like that newElem('foo').append(bar);
[04:24:45] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/nehpC/1/  This works for me only on JS Fiddle.... the first() method doesn't seem to work. any suggestion ?
[04:25:22] <rabbi1> I am unable to delete the value of fields after cloning
[04:42:30] <raj> why does $(window).resize() run twice on resize?
[04:43:07] <raj> are there two windows?
[04:43:12] <raj> in one
[04:46:26] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/nehpC/2/ even this isn't working :(
[04:54:30] <rodr1go> Hi, I have an ajax request which return some data, I simply get this data and append to a table, however in the appended data I have a link wich has  and id to call another ajax, my problem is because this data was appended it is not available outsite the ajax function? I do not want to repeat the same function inside the ajax just to make it work :/
[05:06:12] <antar> Hi
[05:06:46] <antar> help please
[05:10:45] <jammanbo> Given a jQuery.Event, could someone tell me how to trigger an exact copy of it? The event in question isImmediatePropagationStopped, so I believe I need to effectively clone the event in order to get handlers to run.
[05:11:50] <jammanbo> $.event.trigger(event.type, event.data, event.target, false) is my current best guess, but its quite a confusing object.
[05:31:06] <Schrostfutz> how can i iterate over the array which contains b and c?: var test = {"a" : ["b", "c"]};
[05:31:42] <jammanbo> i in test.a?
[05:32:11] <raj> how can I just run $(window).resize(function(ev){runme()}) once for a resize?
[05:32:15] <raj> online it says to use timeout
[05:32:18] <raj> but I'm not sure how to implement that
[05:33:14] <jammanbo> raj: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4298612/jquery-how-to-call-resize-event-only-once-its-finished-resizing
[05:36:05] <raj> jammanbo, still not sure how to mix those together
[05:36:43] <jammanbo> raj: the second answer is complete . . .
[05:37:47] <raj> that's pretty thick
[05:37:57] <raj> why is the first one 2 lines?
[05:38:20] <jammanbo> because it is incomplete
[05:38:27] <jammanbo> it is just the essence of the solution
[05:39:17] <rabbi1> $('.contacts').first().css('border', 'solid 1px red');   --> This gives border for the class having name: contacts....... $('.contacts *').first().css('border', 'solid 1px red');  --> This selects the first element with in  the class name: contacts..... how can i select all element within class name: contacts and that class should be the first element.... ?
[05:39:27] <jammanbo> underscore/lodash has debounce and similar functions if you want to hide the "thickness" at the expense of further "thickness"
[05:40:54] <jammanbo> rabbi1:  http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/. $('.contacts:first *')
[05:41:49] <rabbi1> jammanbo: i read in the 'first() ' section that :first is 10 times slower than first() method....
[05:41:50] <jammanbo> but you could always just add a class to contacts.first and use css to add borders to children
[05:41:57] <jammanbo> prolly
[05:42:36] <rabbi1> I need to add a border for all the elements in .contacts except the first one....
[05:45:19] <jammanbo> I'd still probably apply a class ("selected"?) to the relevant .contact, and use plain old css to add the styling to the children. A class on the first child of .contact would be used to make it's styling different from its siblings, but I'm no speed freak so I don't know about the consequences.
[05:45:28] <rabbi1> jammanbo: $('.contacts').first().css('border', 'solid 1px red');  and $('.contacts:first').css('border', 'solid 1px red');  both are same
[05:46:12] <jammanbo> yes, but they are not what you want are they? (unless you toggle a class like I suggested)
[05:46:57] <rabbi1> ok, now i need to add border for all elements within .contact... how can i do it?
[05:47:25] <jammanbo> out
[05:48:24] <rabbi1> that would be like this: $('.contacts *').css('border', 'solid 1px red');  ... again here i have .contacts more than 1, so i need to add to the first .contact element only
[05:50:31] <rabbi1> for now, say i ignore the first child of .contacts.....
[05:53:01] <rabbi1> jammanbo: that's perfect... :first did the trick...... both are totally different depending on the usage ... :) cool
[05:54:01] <rindolf> Hi all.
[05:55:13] <Schrostfutz> hi rindolf
[05:55:33] <rindolf> Schrostfutz: hi.
[05:55:36] <rindolf> Schrostfutz: what's up?
[06:00:03] <MaddinXx> Hi there. Can someone tell me why this code (line 8) selects all <a> rather than only those with href=""? http://jsfiddle.net/uzGvL/
[06:01:36] <MaddinXx> ouh I guess I should do it with each() rather than in global scope
[06:01:38] <rindolf> MaddinXx: why do you have <a>s without href?
[06:01:48] <rindolf> MaddinXx: for <a name> you should use the id attribute.
[06:02:16] <MaddinXx> rindolf: for subnavigations. where the "parent" li only has functionality in opening it's subnav
[06:02:25] <MaddinXx> e.g. the parent <a>
[06:02:32] <MaddinXx> see HTML code in JSFiddle
[06:02:33] <rindolf> MaddinXx:  if ( $anchor.attr('href') == "#" ) ==> this matches exactly.
[06:02:42] <rindolf> MaddinXx: maybe you want substring or a regular expression.
[06:03:10] <rindolf> MaddinXx: I don't see any HTML code there.
[06:03:19] <MaddinXx> http://jsfiddle.net/uzGvL/1/
[06:04:19] <dns-away> MaddinXx, what tryting to do.
[06:05:33] <MaddinXx> dns-away: on this site: http://fronty.ch/ the navigation to the left. the points "Designer, Collection and Stores" have sublinks. For "Designer" and "Stores" clicking on the link should only toggle the sublinks, for "Designer" it should follow the link
[06:07:03] <MaddinXx> rindolf: dns-away: stupid me - already got it. I needed to call the part to replace the href="" within a each() loop
[06:07:12] <MaddinXx> otherwise it replaced all if it only found one...
[06:11:25] <MaddinXx> thank you two for helping.
[06:15:37] <rindolf> MaddinXx: you'er welcome.

[07:24:37] <sopparus> hello
[07:25:05] <sopparus> anyone know of a javascript that makes it possible to have something like android contact list? to list stuff with a-z on the right
[07:25:24] <sopparus> with html, not an app
[07:34:07] <C10ne> Hi all, I have a question that's probably trivial to experienced developers, but I can't find the way to fix it.
[07:38:38] <Ortund> I'm working on a simple captcha type thing to (hopefully) keep bots from spamming me. Not a big deal if this isn't the best that could be done though
[07:39:03] <Ortund> problem is it keeps coming back saying that the captcha answer is wrong -> http://pastebin.com/vfXdg7nC
[07:39:45] <shoky> Ortund:  .val()  to get it,  .val(newValue)  to set it
[07:39:48] <shoky> ?val @ Ortund
[07:39:49] <bot-t> Ortund, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[07:40:45] <Ortund> shoky got it, but that's not my problem
[07:41:00] <shoky> Ortund: your code shows that problem
[07:41:10] <shoky> if ($("#contact-captcha").val != "green") {
[07:41:47] <Ortund> oh, cos I left off the () ?
[07:41:50] <shoky> doh.
[07:42:14] <shoky> it's a function
[07:42:27] <sonotos> sopparus: http://cordova.apache.org/
[07:42:27] <Ortund> must've been in a rush when I coded that
[07:42:57] <shoky> Ortund: the next line has the same problem
[07:43:06] <shoky> Ortund: well, similar
[07:44:07] <Ortund> yes I see... thanks shoky :)
[07:44:13] <Schrostfutz> hi, i have 2 elements on a website. one contains a loading gif and the other a list. while the list is being loaded, i want to only show the loading image and after its done only show the list. how can i do that? the list is being filled via a callback.
[07:46:25] <Ortund> Schrostfutz I only know how to do that with asp.net using the UpdateProgress control
[07:47:57] <angryasian> Schrostfutz that'll involve some css to make it pretty. I usually just do it by starting off with a gif to begin with. And I remove it in the the $.ajax "success" function.
[07:48:36] <Schrostfutz> i tried to do it with gif.hide(); list.show(); but that didnt work.
[07:48:44] <Schrostfutz> do i really have to remove it?
[07:49:46] <C10ne> I'm loading js files via ajax (I don't control the function that loads the script), and the html before the js, how do I execute some function after the html is displayed?
[07:50:11] <angryasian> If you use the same thing in multiple places you could detach() it I guess. .hide() would work too. I am assuming you are doing $("#loadingGif").hide() or something and your javascript code is correct
[08:07:35] <rodr1go> can anyone help me with this matter? http://pastebin.com/CbXe5Dsq
[08:10:16] <rodr1go> I know I could put the click function inside the success, however I would like to use for other things and to repeat that function wouldn't be good
[08:10:21] <Ortund> shoky, to set a border style in jquery, why doesn't this work? -> $('#contact-captcha').css("border", "5px solid #eee");	
[08:15:50] <shoky> Ortund: seems to work fine http://jsfiddle.net/Jc7nt/
[08:17:53] <rodr1go> no one? lol 769 people and not a soul to help me out :(
[08:19:18] <Ortund> shoky heh weird, doesn't seem to want to work in my page
[08:20:33] <Ortund> http://pastebin.com/etq4G52K
[08:21:32] <innociv_> Okay so, why would the indexedDB.open("DB", 9); never callback an onsuccess or onerror?  That's what it's doing on chrome with just a very basic example.
[08:22:41] <Ortund> lol nm shoky I figured it out
[08:39:56] <Schrostfutz> hi, why does this script only work if i comment the second javascript line? http://jsfiddle.net/wTDpU/1/
[08:42:30] <rgb247> I appending to DOM a text input. With onclick event, I call a function where I need to find the input which I've appended, but it cannot be found. Why?
[08:58:34] <angryasian> test doesn't have a function called find
[08:58:51] <angryasian> You have a syntax error. $(test).find('div') would work though.
[08:59:23] <angryasian> not syntax. runtime.
[09:20:14] <tolborg> argh.. recently I saw a website, where the top right corner was 'broken' and revealed a bit of the html source. You could then pull the top layer and see more of the code. Has anyone seen similar effect?
[09:31:25] <jrajav> tolborg: That's how all websites work, the code just sits underneath the top layer. Didn't you know?

[10:09:52] <Schrostfutz> is there a way to prevent the website from scrolling?
[10:10:12] <raj> wouldn't this http://stackoverflow.com/a/5497333/997624 include the underscore?
[10:10:20] <raj> why is there pos+1?
[10:10:26] <raj> i would think it would be just pos
[10:10:30] <Schrostfutz> or to center a div in the center of the page no matter wether the user scrolls
[10:10:33] <jrajav> Schrostfutz: body { overflow: hidden }
[10:11:02] <jrajav> Schrostfutz: That's probably a much better solution, and the answer to that one is position: fixed
[10:13:49] <jrajav> raj: No, because substring goes up to, but not including the second index when given two indices, and it starts from the index when only given one
[10:13:58] <jrajav> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substring
[10:14:21] <jrajav> 'abc'.substring(0,1) --> 'a'
[10:14:25] <raj> jrajav, up to an not including would be mean `pos` itself should be enough
[10:14:29] <jrajav> 'abc'.substring(1) --> 'bc'
[10:14:42] <jrajav> raj: No, then the second substring would include _
[10:15:01] <raj> i meant for the first substring
[10:15:02] <jrajav> raj: Read what I said again
[10:15:11] <jrajav> raj: The second one is a single-index substring call
[10:15:17] <jrajav> The first one is a two-index substring call
[10:15:48] <raj> yes, I'm referring to the two-index substring call
[10:15:51] <shoky> i think raj is right
[10:15:53] <raj> why wouldn't it just be `pos`
[10:16:00] <raj> woohoo
[10:16:44] <shoky> and a simple test shows him to be
[10:17:02] <jrajav> Hmm. Yeah, guess I missed that
[10:17:03] <jrajav> My bad
[10:17:08] <jrajav> I was only looking at the second one
[10:20:50] <Schrostfutz> what could be the reason, that show() and hide() doesnt work on a <img> element?
[10:22:15] <shoky> many many possible reasons
[10:22:40] <shoky> especially as "doesnt work" could mean "doesnt make me a cup of coffee"
[10:23:16] <Schrostfutz> i try to hide a <img> element but it is still visible. when i hide other elements at the same place and time in the code they vanish.

[10:32:10] <r00723r0> Schrostfutz: what's the issue?
[10:32:59] <Schrostfutz> the picture is still visible, but it shouldnt be
[10:33:28] <r00723r0> Schrostfutz: your selector '.throbber img' is wrong.
[10:33:36] <r00723r0> just do test.hide().
[10:33:43] <Burian> Is there anything special about using a $.post() command in a .change()?  In another part of my code, I have the $.post() command working inside of a .on(), however it fails inside of the .change().

[10:35:33] <Schrostfutz> r00723r0: yeah that works. but in my code there is many other stuff around the <img> element.
[10:37:38] <Burian> r00723r0: I am able to capture the values that I want from the .change(), and for debugging purposes I print them out before the $.post() command
[10:38:00] <Schrostfutz> here is a better example: http://jsfiddle.net/nxvYH/2/
[10:38:26] <Chris_CC> Hi guys .. my jquery to populate a select/option drop down menu doesn't seem to be working for IOS / Mac .. any help ... www.driveaddiction.com   if you sign up iwth any name/email/password .. it's int he next be when selecting a location .. here's the jquery/html http://pastebin.com/1tevnQTR
[10:39:02] <r00723r0> Burian: then there is no reason $.post shouldn't work within .change.
[10:39:13] <r00723r0> Burian: Unless .change invokes a form submission or navigation of any other kind.
[10:39:57] <Chris_CC> r00723r0: hmm thanks i did the car selectiona  differnt way and that seems to work so may try revert it to that
[10:41:53] <Burian> r00723r0: I am at a loss why it would not be working.  The .change does not invoke a form submission or navigation.  Simply captures the change of a html dropdown.  Once it reaches the $.post code, it does not execute any code, such as alert() afterwards
[10:42:22] <r00723r0> Burian: can you see in your network inspector if the request is sent?
[10:43:03] <r00723r0> Hopefully you already know that $.post is actually happening by putting a console.log after it.
[10:43:27] <Burian> r00723r0: When you say network inspector, are you referring to a program like WireShark?
[10:43:43] <r00723r0> I am referring to your browser typically.
[10:43:47] <r00723r0> But WireShark will do.
[10:44:26] <Chris_CC> r00723r0: i don;t have those tools :( it seems to be this $(document).on('click', '.location', function(){ is not firing when you click "done" in IOS / MAc ... bt if you then click it again it works
[10:44:47] <r00723r0> Chris_CC: pardon?
[10:44:52] <r00723r0> I was talking to Burian.
[10:45:00] <r00723r0> Chris_CC: make a working example on JSbin.
[10:45:00] <Chris_CC> oh haha
[10:45:38] <Burian> r00723r0: I was not aware of using console.log.  Do you mean simply wrapping the $.post() as console.log($.post())?
[10:45:58] <systemfault> Definitely not..
[10:46:16] <systemfault> Who cares about the promise object $.post returns
[10:46:28] <systemfault> You care about the handlers you attach to it.
[10:46:36] <r00723r0> Burian: oh no no.
[10:46:41] <r00723r0> Well, you can.
[10:46:51] <r00723r0> But I would just put a console.log directly after the $.post.
[10:46:59] <r00723r0> To make sure you're actually getting to that line of code.
[10:47:07] <Burian> ok
[10:50:00] <Burian> r00723r0: The console helped me figure out my problem.  Thanks for all of the help
[10:51:46] <systemfault> The console is your best friend :)
[10:51:54] <systemfault> The second one being the debugger
[10:52:06] <r00723r0> I never use the debugger.
[10:54:12] <systemfault> r00723r0: I only use it for more complex debugging, when you need to understand what's happening at every step
[10:59:13] <shoky> Schrostfutz your selector is still wrong
[11:02:04] <sekyms> Can I get qa quick eye on this? http://pastebin.com/ZnP235Nq  not sure why that last show_info_text is getting called three times
[11:04:12] <r00723r0> sekyms: make a JSbin.
[11:05:05] <sekyms> eyah i ca do that
[11:05:17] <sekyms> i was hoping it would be something stupid you could see right away
[11:07:59] <Schrostfutz> shoelessone: why is it wrong? i use another approach now but i would like to see my mistake
[11:09:58] <shoky> Schrostfutz:  '.throbber img'  means an <img> element that is a descendant of another element with class 'throbber'
[11:10:31] <raj> with this code, no_ellipsis_text and shorter_text are the same length--> http://paste.ofcode.org/3hrsq9aSEDjbEMg6ukGwFz
[11:11:02] <shoky> raj: so?
[11:11:06] <raj> why?
[11:11:16] <shoky> raj:
[11:11:18] <raj> no_ellipsis_text.length shouldn't be included, no?
[11:11:24] <raj> up to but not including
[11:11:29] <shoky> ?eval "12345".substring(0, 5)
[11:11:32] <bot-t> shoky: "12345"
[11:11:37] <raj> omg
[11:11:40] <raj> cuz it's an index
[11:11:41] <raj> of course
[11:11:42] <shoky> ;p
[11:11:43] <raj> gawd
[11:17:54] <Schrostfutz> shoky: ah! thanks
[11:19:53] <Schrostfutz> is there a way of overlapping two divs?
[11:20:01] <raj> position:absolute
[11:20:33] <raj> then make sure that the top,bottom,left,and right properties match
[11:21:57] <Schrostfutz> raj: can i use that if i want to overlap a specific element?
[11:22:24] <raj> position:Absolute on even just 1 element will allow it to be moved wherever
[11:22:29] <raj> overlapping any element
[11:23:49] <Schrostfutz> okay, thanks
[11:33:45] <Schrostfutz> does setTimeout block the execution?
[11:35:14] <motka> setTimeout(function() { alert('second'); }, 2000); alert('first');
[11:35:30] <Schrostfutz> okay, ty
[11:35:45] <motka> by that example, it does not! if you try that code, first you will get ('first'), after 2 secs. you will get "second" :)
[11:48:38] <finspin> any ideas why toggle is not delayed at all in this code? http://dpaste.com/855665/
[11:54:20] <shoky> finspin: .delay() only delays queued stuff like animations
[11:55:16] <vladikoff> finspin, use .fadeToggle()
[11:56:24] <saltcod> Can anyone point me in the right direction wrt to re-creating the effect here: http://www.fearthegrizzly.com/
[11:56:38] <saltcod> I want to fade out a background image as I scroll down the page
[11:57:10] <finspin> shoky: oh, didn't know that, thanks
[11:57:51] <Hapzzz> hi, i currently use ajax to replace the content of div.content (main page content, withotu the header and footer)
[11:58:05] <Hapzzz> but this creates a mess when going between pages and then clicking the browser's "back" button
[11:58:25] <Hapzzz> i've seen github.com "sliding" new pages in, and changing the address in the location bar
[11:58:27] <finspin> vladikoff: thanks for the pointer but i think fadeToggle() is not what i really want. with delay() i wanted to delay showing and hiding the button in case of accidental hovers.
[11:58:31] <Hapzzz> is that ajax? how do they do that?
[11:59:01] <derPepo> Hapzzz: its a little bit complicated and many fragments to develop the solution :(
[11:59:15] <derPepo> but. yepp its ajax ;-)
[11:59:43] <vladikoff> finspin, well in your example, you just replace .toggle with .fadeToggle to get the effect. also look into http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[12:00:16] <Hapzzz> derPepo umm it looks like a couple of lines only - https://github.com/blog/760-the-tree-slider
[12:00:18] <Hapzzz> am i missing something?
[12:00:47] <shoky> finspin: you can do .delay(5000).queue(function(next){ $(this).toggle(); next(); })
[12:00:49] <derPepo> jepp a couple of lines but it will not work in IE
[12:01:05] <Hapzzz> oh, i only care for firefox tbh
[12:01:09] <Hapzzz> why won't it work in ie though?
[12:01:44] <derPepo> pushstate "only" change your location.href witout a request
[12:02:17] <Hapzzz> derPepo this should solve my issue i think
[12:02:23] <derPepo> ok
[12:02:26] <vladikoff> Hapzzz, http://caniuse.com/#feat=history
[12:02:39] <finspin> vladikoff: just tried that but fadeToggle() animates the show/hide effect. i don't want to animate it, just delay it.
[12:03:16] <vladikoff> Hapzzz, http://backbonejs.org/#History-start
[12:03:52] <vladikoff> Hapzzz, that's how backbone does it with a fallback to hash changes
[12:04:06] <Hapzzz> right.
[12:04:07] <Hapzzz> thanks.
[12:04:51] <vladikoff> finspin, do you want to just hide the link?
[12:06:19] <finspin> shoky: that works, thanks!
[12:07:56] <finspin> vladikoff: no, im showing/hiding a button on hover. since there are many hover targets next to each other i want to put some delay on this effect since there might be many accidental hovers. so delaying is the first step but i just realized it's not ideal solution.
[12:08:27] <SteveC> So, trying to write a function to fill a div with a repeating image (because css background opacity support is so crap).  What I've got is: http://pastebin.com/S9KeyG1G - the problem is that it's ignoring the "overflow: hidden" and wrapping images to the next line.
[12:11:28] <finspin> vladikoff: what im actually trying to do is this: show the button on hover but only if the user stays on the hover object for at least 0.5 seconds. so delay is not the right approach. i will probably make a jsfiddle demo :)
[12:13:35] <Cronoh> finspin to a set timeout on a function
[12:14:07] <Cronoh> when it executes, check again that you are still hovering
[12:14:11] <Cronoh> ezpz
[12:15:27] <finspin> Cronoh: ok, will look into this approach, thanks
[12:24:55] <hero> How do I get current slide number in jquery cycle on click of a button?
[12:27:00] <finspin> vladikoff: found out i've been reinventing the wheel. hoverIntent plugin is what i want http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html :)
[12:30:06] <vladikoff> finspin, hoverIntent is a really old plugin, be careful
[12:31:17] <finspin> vladikoff: yes, i noticed that, just testing it. are you aware of any issues with it?

[13:13:37] <shoky> aaairc: weird.. no idea ;P
[13:14:18] <aaairc> anyone else... new question is why does this http://jsfiddle.net/kEgzr/1/ work in Safari and Firefox but not Chrome on Mac
[13:14:22] <aaairc> ?
[13:15:54] <shoky> aaairc: log the error

[13:16:50] <shoky> aaairc: and look at your console. don't use alerts for debugging
[13:18:57] <shoky> aaairc: it works fine for me  on OSX chrome too
[13:19:14] <aaairc> shoky: hmmm weird.
[13:19:35] <shoky> log the error..
[13:19:41] <shoky> instead of wondering about it
[13:19:50] <shoky> check your devtools network tab

[14:20:31] <Schrostfutz> so if i have a object that looks like this: o = { foo :  [123, 234, 345], bar: true} i could call the function like this: getJSON('http://graph.facebook.com/', { ids: o.foo }, function(data)?

[14:54:23] <Innocentus> hi
[14:54:25] <tripflex> so if i understand this correctly, .load is a shortcut for ajax, correct?
[14:54:28] <Innocentus> I got an A-element
[14:54:34] <tripflex> and ajax is async
[14:54:37] <Innocentus> now I want to extract the css of :hover for this A-element
[14:54:41] <Innocentus> is this possible with JQuery?
[14:54:59] <monk3y> Innocentus: you want to 'extract' the 'css'?
[14:55:04] <monk3y> You mean you want to see the rules?
[14:55:07] <tripflex> Innocentus, yo uwant to change it or extract it
[14:55:12] <monk3y> Or you want to apply them to another element?
[14:57:06] <Innocentus> monk3y: yes, the rule o it
[14:57:16] <Innocentus> monk3y: background-image
[14:57:32] <monk3y> So; you want to extract just the one property?
[15:00:51] <Innocentus> monk3y: yes, background-image-url
[15:00:52] <monk3y> tripflex: all I could do was read up the jQuery API docs for .load and .ajax, and they're similar, and load could be used as a kind-of shortcut for ajax, I guess.
[15:01:12] <monk3y> So have you Googled for "jquery get background image property"?
[15:01:37] <monk3y> I don't mean to be curt, just seems like a pretty simple thing could save us both time to solve.
[15:01:53] <tripflex> :P
[15:01:56] <monk3y> It's here, btw.
[15:01:56] <monk3y> http://webdevel.blogspot.ca/2009/07/jquery-quick-tip-extract-css-background.html
[15:14:17] <monk3y> Innocentus: did that help/work?
[15:14:26] <tripflex> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14086747/using-jquery-ajax-with-php-to-display-current-progress
[15:14:38] <tripflex> my question is too large to post directly in here :D
[15:14:57] <shoky> tripflex .load is not just a shortcut for ajax..
[15:15:50] <tripflex> but is load Async?
[15:16:09] <shoky> tripflex: your problem is the 's' counter ?
[15:16:14] <shoky> tripflex yes it's async
[15:16:33] <shoky> tripflex: so by the time the callback is called, the loop is already long over
[15:16:49] <tripflex> ok yeah wihch would be the function appending right?
[15:16:58] <shoky> yes
[15:17:11] <tripflex> do you have any suggestions on how i hsould go about this?
[15:17:17] <monk3y> shoky: would I be right in thinking he needs to use deferred or promises to wait to request the next 'step' once the first step has returned (.ajax:success)?
[15:17:34] <monk3y> s/first/previous/
[15:17:43] <shoky> tripflex: you can do this:  for (var s=0; s<2; s++) { (function(s) { $(..).append('bla' + s); })(s) }
[15:18:00] <shoky> tripflex: that way each loop iteration has its own local function scope
[15:18:07] <shoky> so the 's' is preserved
[15:18:16] <shoky> you can also use $.each
[15:18:40] <tripflex> but i thought each was used to loop through results?
[15:18:46] <tripflex> like when you pull divs from dom or something
[15:19:15] <shoky> that's $(...).each
[15:19:17] <tripflex> sorry i'm still learning and between php and jquery it's got me confused :P
[15:19:19] <shoky> not $.each
[15:19:25] <tripflex> ahh
[15:19:27] <shoky> but, you can just use the example i showed you
[15:19:33] <shoky> with an inner function scope
[15:20:11] <shoky> oops
[15:20:30] <shoky> i forgot the .load  ;p
[15:21:13] <tripflex> i would just nest the append inside the load right?
[15:21:58] <shoky> yeah
[15:22:39] <shoky> for (var s=0; s<2; s++) { (function(s) {  $().load(.., function() { $().append('bla'+s) }) }(s) }
[15:23:14] <shoky> monk3y: that's true too :0
[15:23:25] <shoky> tripflex: monk3y has a point
[15:23:44] <shoky> tripflex: you're just loading both steps right away.. without waiting for the first to complete or something
[15:23:58] <tripflex> yeah that's originally why i was attmepting to nest it
[15:24:08] <monk3y> Wow .. serious?  Heh, I just typed a few keywords I've read on here over the past few weeks (deferred, promise), and hoped for the best . . .
[15:24:23] <tripflex> so i originally tried
[15:24:46] <shoky> heh well the imporant but was about waiting for the next step
[15:24:55] <shoky> deferreds/promises are a convenient way to do so
[15:24:57] <tripflex> success: function
[15:25:40] <tripflex> http://jsfiddle.net/tJNHr/
[15:25:47] <tripflex> so that's originally what i was trying to use
[15:25:53] <tripflex> ah forgot one part just a sec
[15:26:04] <monk3y> Yeah.  tripflex: I can see why you were thinking procedurally/nesting each call .. but if I'm right, I think you can use a combination of the loop and nesting .. per-se.  Go through the loop, and for each call, attach a promise to call the next request, using the step-counter.
[15:27:33] <tripflex> http://jsfiddle.net/tJNHr/2/
[15:27:46] <tripflex> so that was my original thought afte talking to a couple poeple in here yesterday
[15:27:55] <tripflex> but i soon learned i can't use the same thought process i would for PHP
[15:28:00] <tripflex> in for loops
[15:28:26] <sopparus> anyone know of a javascript that makes it possible to have something like android contact list? to list stuff with a-z on the right
[15:28:34] <sopparus> with html, not an app
[15:29:19] <tripflex> so shoky or monk3y do you think i should use that same process from the jsfiddle and just modify it to run correctly?
[15:29:35] <shoky> tripflex here's one way to go.. http://jsfiddle.net/rsrFW/1/
[15:31:03] <tripflex> ah i see
[15:31:08] <tripflex> so you're putting it into it's own function
[15:31:13] <tripflex> and then calling it based upon the step
[15:32:12] <tripflex> being async though will that cause any problems?
[15:32:16] <tripflex> using that method
[15:32:35] <tripflex> ah nevermind
[15:32:41] <tripflex> you have it inside the callback
[15:32:45] <monk3y> The complete function won't fire until it's back.
[15:32:48] <monk3y> Yeah.
[15:33:06] <monk3y> So the UI will do whatever/anything else it's doing, until that callback gets fired.
[15:33:40] <monk3y> Now; you may want to consider what would happen if anything in any of the steps (on the server/PHP) side fails, and progress doesn't .. progress.  If you have an error, you should handle it.
[15:33:55] <tripflex> yeah that was going to be my next step
[15:33:57] <monk3y> So in this case if the server comes back with a 200, it's cool, but a 500 would still respond and fire the callback.
[15:34:03] <tripflex> want to at least get it working correctly first :)
[15:34:07] <monk3y> Hence why .ajax might be a little more flexible for you.
[15:34:15] <tripflex> yeah so probably anything over 400 i would throw error with
[15:34:31] <tripflex> yeah that's what i got from talkign to people in here yesterday
[15:34:51] <tripflex> so lemme try and combine that one with the ajax one i have
[15:34:55] <tripflex> and see what you guys think
[15:37:46] <shoky> tripflex: don't listen to the SO guy saying to use $.post :P
[15:39:00] <tripflex> how does this look
[15:39:01] <tripflex> http://jsfiddle.net/tJNHr/2/
[15:39:05] <tripflex> haha okay i wont :)
[15:39:46] <monk3y> Who's the SO guy?  Who said .post?
[15:39:50] * monk3y squints judgementally
[15:40:41] <lucenut> Hey guys. I'm using $.ajax({ url: url, success: voters_success }); to submit a form asynchronously. But I need to pass an id to the voters_success function.
[15:40:49] <shoky> tripflex jsfiddle is really slow now, and you posted the same link from before :P
[15:41:21] * monk3y joins the dots
[15:41:25] <monk3y> tripflex: you broke jsFiddle.
[15:41:26] <tripflex> http://www.hastebin.com/fusekokuti.vhdl
[15:41:30] <tripflex> lol
[15:41:48] <tripflex> oopsies
[15:41:49] <tripflex> haha
[15:42:03] <shoky> looks fine
[15:42:16] <monk3y> Looks alright.  But; when does it terminate?
[15:42:16] <shoky> tho , different behaviour from the .load version
[15:43:02] <monk3y> It's probably best to make the data: json, and send back a package of 'return-val' (success/error), and the status message/percentage.
[15:43:04] <tripflex> um, when, s > numSteps ?
[15:43:14] <monk3y> Heh sorry, overlooked that.
[15:43:34] <tripflex> no please any critisism or suggestions are greatly appreciated
[15:43:34] <monk3y> I'm . . ..I'm uh . .. colour-blind, specifically and only to the colour-scheme you pasted it into.
[15:43:35] <monk3y> Etc.
[15:43:40] <shoky> you mean dataType: 'json'  ;p
[15:43:52] <monk3y> And . .
[15:43:53] <monk3y> Uh. . .
[15:44:04] <tripflex> haha yeah i use hastebin to post directly from linux cli
[15:44:05] <monk3y> I'm dyslexic .. intermittently.
[15:44:07] <tripflex> just used to using it
[15:44:39] <shoky> i like the id your paste god..
[15:44:42] <shoky> got
[15:44:46] <shoky> fusekokuti
[15:44:58] <monk3y> Heheh, sounds like a Japanese chick I dated once.
[15:45:03] <tripflex> haha
[15:45:04] <shoky> ;]
[15:45:29] <monk3y> hahah
[15:45:31] <shoky> hm seems they all get such names
[15:45:33] <shoky> ;]
[15:45:36] <monk3y>  . . ....  it's . . .it's REALLY YOU?!!??!
[15:45:36] <imsky> oh lawdy
[15:45:44] <monk3y> fusekokuti: ASL?
[15:45:50] <imsky> is this #jquery
[15:45:55] <tripflex> so monk3y you were saying to use json, i briefly looked at it using php to send the json data but how would i process that in that ajax?
[15:46:12] <tripflex> 12/m/GA
[15:46:14] <tripflex> :P
[15:46:32] <tripflex> haha is it bad i remember what ASL means?
[15:46:40] <imsky> no it means you're not really 12
[15:46:42] <tripflex> i'm 27 and remmber that from the AOL days
[15:46:46] <monk3y> Well in the success function, you'd introspect the json to see firstly whether it was successful (data.returnVal), and then display the contents however you want (data.content).
[15:47:11] <fusekokuti> introspect?
[15:47:16] <monk3y> But it may be over-complicating it for what you need.  As long as your returned HTML data displays new progress, or failure/error/interruption, etc.
[15:47:22] <tripflex> ah i see jsfiddle is using nginx
[15:47:30] <monk3y> fusekokuti: you used to love it when I used esoteric words like that.
[15:47:54] <tripflex> yeah i was just going to return from the php file either an error or the progress message
[15:47:56] <tripflex> so either
[15:48:02] <monk3y> Ok that's cool.
[15:48:05] <tripflex> download file blah.php completed...
[15:48:08] <tripflex> or
[15:48:13] <tripflex> CURL Error: blah blah
[15:48:21] <tripflex> well that's how i have it now at least
[15:48:23] <tripflex> plain text
[15:48:45] <monk3y> I guess if you have anything else that needs to react from the result of the progress update on your client-side, it's cleanest to use json so you can check some values.  But if it's *just* displaying progress, then HTML's fine.
[15:49:01] <monk3y> Heh if you're fine displaying "CURL error" to your users, then you're sweet.
[15:49:58] <imsky> i curl weights
[15:50:04] <imsky> is that what you guys are talking about
[15:50:18] <monk3y> Uh.
[15:50:20] <monk3y> Yeah.
[15:50:42] <monk3y> s/#jquery/#gymJunkies
[15:51:05] <shoky> curling is fun
[15:51:08] <imsky> nice joke bro i didn't know curl was a clientside javascript library
[15:51:18] <imsky> such a smart monkey
[15:51:21] <shoky> sweeping the ice and all
[15:51:29] <tripflex> hah no using php and jquery together
[15:51:39] <tripflex> which makes for lots of fun being one is client side and one server side
[15:51:39] <tripflex> bleh
[15:51:45] <imsky> yeah i never had any problems
[15:52:05] <tripflex> it's just a different method of doing things
[15:52:16] <imsky> just use a wrapper library broooo
[15:52:19] <tripflex> so i've been having problems because i'm writing the jquery code like iw ould php
[15:52:23] <tripflex> or at least trying to
[15:52:23] <tripflex> haha
[15:52:32] <imsky> https://github.com/shuber/curl
[15:52:44] <imsky> https://github.com/stil/curl-easy
[15:53:08] <tripflex> i know php that's easy
[15:53:19] <imsky> yeah man doing set_opt a lot of times is easy
[15:53:23] <imsky> i hear you
[15:53:32] <tripflex> that's why i wrote my own function to do it :)
[15:53:38] <imsky> oh you did
[15:53:42] <imsky> did you know someone else did that before you
[15:54:02] <tripflex> so who stuck a stick up your ass?
[15:54:14] <tripflex> of course, but i needed mine to specifically match the settings on my server
[15:54:18] <imsky> lol i like how you reject my advice and it turns out you poorly reimplemented a wrapper anyway
[15:54:24] <shoky> imsky is the stick up #jquery's ass
[15:54:27] <relipse> is there a way to see all event attached to a button, like getevents(button, 'onclick')
[15:54:42] <imsky> shoky is the stick up freenode's ass
[15:54:43] <imsky> relipse: yes
[15:55:13] <tripflex> oh no i appreciate it i've already starred the curl wrapper for later use in other projects :)
[15:55:27] <imsky> "who stuck a stick up your ass" == "i appreciate it"
[15:56:38] <tripflex> shoky & monk3y i appreciate the help i'm going to go ahead nad play around with some code and see what i can come up with
[15:56:44] <tripflex> thanks for looking into it for me and helping out
[15:56:50] <monk3y> np trip
[15:56:59] <tripflex> imsky, of course because anybody can search github for a curl wrapper
[15:57:08] <tripflex> i'm not in the jquery channel to ask about php
[15:57:27] <tripflex> but like i said, i appreciate you giving me the link so i don't have to later :)
[15:58:17] <zg> anyone know how to modify chrome omnibox data
[15:58:40] <monk3y> You wanna delete history?
[15:58:42] <monk3y> (heh)
[15:58:47] <zg> chrome://omnibox
[16:01:58] <tripflex> AWESOME
[16:01:59] <tripflex> it works
[16:02:05] <tripflex> hells yes
[16:02:14] <clothead> great job everyone, let's all take five
[16:02:26] <PrgmrBill> ^5
[16:02:33] <tripflex> yeah for sure, first round is on me :)
[16:09:06] <Innocentus> monk3y|afk: yes
[16:09:27] <vrlogrs> hey guys ..
[16:10:10] <vrlogrs> im trying to use .animate() to enlarge and shrink some text in a <h2> tag
[16:10:45] <tripflex> do you just want to change the css settings or are you trying to use animate
[16:10:57] <vrlogrs> i would like to animate it ..
[16:11:06] <vrlogrs> im trying to use it to draw attention to the text
[16:11:23] <vrlogrs> so, it will enlarge, change color, and then return to its original size and colour
[16:20:00] <tripflex> under .ajax would it be better to use statusCode: then specify something for each code or should that be handled under error:
[16:20:17] <RonWhoCares> I am designing a form for users to submit their selections.  I am wondering if there is a way to display an image when a product has been selected.  Each product has it's own number.  ( an auto_increment field from mySQL )  I am wondering if this would help to facilitate this?  The form is at https://www.theverseoftheday.info/ebay-wallet-card-selection/
[16:20:51] <RonWhoCares> When I say " been selected " I mean is included in their order
[16:20:56] <Iszak> tripflex well there's different types of errors, so you could have an error and have specific error cases.
[16:21:18] <tripflex> yeah true
[16:21:21] <tripflex> good point
[16:24:22] <clothead> hey Iszak
[16:24:31] <clothead> nice to see you are still alive
[16:24:43] <Iszak> I am, in old blighty.
[16:25:00] <Iszak> clothead what's with the name change?
[16:25:38] <coldhead> lovely old blighty
[16:25:43] <coldhead> that winter wonderland
[16:25:47] <coldhead> how i envy you
[16:26:08] <Iszak> coldhead why would you do that?
[16:26:46] <coldhead> i don't know, social conditioning?
[16:27:21] <Iszak> If anything, you should hate me for being a traitor.
[16:27:42] <coldhead> on the contrary, i think you're a better person for it
[16:28:05] <coldhead> you make the rest of us look like convict scum
[16:28:15] <coldhead> meanwhile you're having high tea with the queen
[16:28:21] <Iszak> oh man.. you don't know how much shit I get for that. They say criminals go back to the scene of the crime.
[16:28:30] <coldhead> hahahahaha
[16:29:11] <Iszak> But yeah, get a lot of flak for that and to think, we sent all the crims to tas.
[16:29:56] <coldhead> at least they let you back in
[16:30:28] <Iszak> yeah, true. You still at MF?
[16:30:40] <Iszak> or was that your company.. I can't remember.
[16:30:51] <coldhead> i'm with some other other company now
[16:30:56] <coldhead> it's not very interesting
[16:31:08] <Iszak> other other? You should do what oksushi does and start your own company.
[16:31:20] <C10ne> I'm loading js files via ajax (I don't control the function that loads the script), and the html before the js, how do I execute some function after the html is displayed?
[16:31:53] <Iszak> C10ne with great difficulties, you could do it before with dom mutation events (not cross browser) and now they're changing the spec (or already have)
[16:32:03] <Iszak> C10ne so you better hope to your AJAX god that they have events/callbacks.
[16:32:06] <ravenzz> ?loadScript @ C10ne
[16:32:08] <bot-t> C10ne, jQuery.getScript() - Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[16:32:13] <ravenzz> whatever
[16:32:18] <zg> is there a way to call a function after .on
[16:32:23] <zg> has finished processing, for any event
[16:32:33] <zg> sort of like a post processing phase
[16:32:41] <Iszak> C10ne what ravenzz  should work.
[16:32:46] <zg> $('.input').on({ ... }) <- after this, I want to call another function
[16:32:51] <ravenzz> C10ne you can define a callback which will be executed when your script is loaded
[16:33:18] <ravenzz> or just create a new script element define your onload event handler and the script src
[16:33:31] <vladikoff> woa it's Iszak!
[16:33:55] <ravenzz> then*
[16:34:04] <Iszak> vladikoff did I miss anything?
[16:34:09] <ravenzz> +some mistakes
[16:34:43] <C10ne> I know about getscript and callbacks, but that part is handled by the framework, so I'm trying not to tweak it (I'm using SilverStripe)
[16:35:44] <ravenzz> sorry I don't even know what SilverStripe is
[16:35:57] <vrlogrs> does this look right : http://jsfiddle.net/888C8/3/
[16:38:16] <C10ne> Never mind what it is, just to say, I don't affect the way it loads scripts or the callbacks, I'm sure it uses getScript, but the scripts are loaded in the same ajax call as the page, so the DOM isn't displayed when the script executes
[16:38:43] <ravenzz> vrlogrs http://jsfiddle.net/888C8/4/
[16:38:51] <C10ne> I can use .live() or .on for events, but the problem is loading the plugins
[16:39:07] <vrlogrs> awesome -- thanks ravenzz
[16:39:55] <tripflex> so it looks like using .ajax and error: does not work cross domain
[16:40:04] <tripflex> so does that mean i need to do my own error handling?
[16:40:37] <ravenzz> uh?
[16:40:49] <ravenzz> ?doesn't work
[16:40:49] <tripflex> ah in comes json
[16:40:49] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[16:40:50] <tripflex> hah
[16:41:07] <tripflex> jquery specifically says
[16:41:08] <tripflex> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[16:41:23] <tripflex> the errorThrown handler is not called for cross-domain
[16:42:29] <tripflex> looks like i need to use jsonp to handle it
[16:42:51] <ravenzz> ah wait
[16:43:01] <Iszak> coldhead you at work now?
[16:43:07] <ravenzz> do you want to handler cross domain (exceptions) errors?
[16:43:18] <tripflex> yes
[16:43:20] <ravenzz> those are exceptions not errors
[16:43:29] <tripflex> hmm
[16:43:40] <tripflex> well
[16:43:45] <ravenzz> ?g exceptions mdn
[16:43:46] <bot-t> ravenzz, Error - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error
[16:44:00] <tripflex> i think it's the way i'm doing the processing
[16:44:20] <tripflex> because actually the .ajax is getting the local php file
[16:44:21] <ravenzz> basically you need to wrap anything in a try catch block
[16:44:30] <tripflex> which then contacts a remote server for data
[16:44:36] <tripflex> that looks like my issue
[16:44:43] <ravenzz> actually you would define it as a function you call within the try block
[16:44:55] <tripflex> forgot about a step in the process :)
[16:45:07] <ravenzz> oor check the url against the current domain
[16:45:07] <tripflex> so ajax is going to get a 200 response because it's calling the local file
[16:45:18] <ravenzz> and return before to make the ajax req
[16:45:49] <ravenzz> ok then
[16:45:52] <ravenzz> ?demo @ tripflex
[16:45:53] <bot-t> tripflex, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[16:46:09] <tripflex> yeah sorry guys i'm thinking out loud
[16:46:09] <tripflex> heh
[16:46:19] <tripflex> just a sec
[16:46:39] <ravenzz> I drunk half liter of wine, just saying
[16:47:26] <tripflex> yeah the error handling wont be done through jquery as jquery is just calling the php file to do the processing
[16:47:51] <vrlogrs> i dont understand why this wont work :S http://jsfiddle.net/888C8/6/
[16:47:57] <tripflex> so i'm thinking, maybe setup the php file to do the error handling, then pass the data to ajax/jquery and use ajax/jquery to look for a specific variable or something
[16:48:34] <tripflex> vrlogrs, it does work?
[16:48:46] <tripflex> so looks like json would be best for this
[16:48:55] <tripflex> because then i could pass the json to ajax
[16:49:07] <vrlogrs> tripflex: its not working
[16:49:19] <vrlogrs> colour is not changing, and it doesnt resize after the initial resize
[16:50:04] <shoky> ?g jquery color @ vrlogrs
[16:50:05] <bot-t> vrlogrs, jquery/jquery-color · GitHub - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/
[16:50:24] <Iszak> vrlogrs because .css('fontSize') returns +px so you're doing 14pxpx
[16:50:43] <Iszak> change fontSize: origsize + "px" to fontSize: origsize in the complete callback
[16:51:22] <tripflex> oh sorry just quickly looked at it
[16:51:49] <vrlogrs> any ideas why ?
[16:51:59] <tripflex> yeah Iszak is right
[16:52:02] <Iszak> vrlogrs also use that plugin shoky suggested to animate colours. If you're going to expand to multiple elements I would suggest using data to store the original size/colour per element instead of a local variable.
[16:52:15] <vrlogrs> got it
[16:52:25] <vrlogrs> only the colour is the problem now: http://jsfiddle.net/888C8/7/
[16:53:10] <shoky> vrlogrs: http://jsfiddle.net/888C8/8/
[16:53:21] <vrlogrs> awesome shoky
[16:53:48] <vrlogrs> i would prefer not to have to include more files though :S
[16:54:19] <Iszak> vrlogrs well unfortunately jquery doesn't know how to animate colours AFAIK.
[16:54:24] <shoky> then concatenate them into your own js..
[16:55:05] <Iszak> yeah you should be concating that shit, but i would use a 3rd party library because it's maintained.
[16:55:20] <vrlogrs> hmm
[16:55:38] <vrlogrs> what abould font-weight? can jquery animate that?
[16:55:53] <zg> coldhead:
[16:55:57] <shoky> i doubt it
[16:57:51] <vrlogrs> hmm
[16:58:01] <Iszak> yeah I agree, I doubt it.
[16:58:13] <vrlogrs> do u guys know of any fancy text animations that draw attention to it
[16:58:16] <Iszak> plus some browsers don't even render numeric based font-weights correctly.
[16:58:17] <vrlogrs> other than size of course
[16:58:30] <Iszak> vrlogrs I heard marquee was good at the turn of the century.
[16:58:45] <shoky> i <3 that marquee still works
[16:58:53] <Iszak> or blink even.
[16:58:55] <shoky> at least in chrome
[16:58:56] <vrlogrs> marquee? o.O
[16:59:02] <shoky> <marquee>
[16:59:05] <Iszak> throw some hot pink it
[16:59:29] <tripflex> i'm in love with sublime text 2
[16:59:30] <chilversc> if blink doesn't work, I'm sure I saw a polyfil for it somewhere :)
[16:59:36] <tripflex> i can't believe i used any other ide's
[17:02:17] <vrlogrs> alright, i guess ill play around with it
[17:02:18] <vrlogrs> thanks guys
[17:11:09] <coldhead> Iszak: i'm on holiday
[17:11:30] <coldhead> tripflex: did you pay for sublime text?
[17:11:47] <tripflex> yes
[17:11:51] <tripflex> you don't have to
[17:11:55] <tripflex> but i did to support the developer
[17:12:52] <Iszak> coldhead lucky for some.
[17:13:09] <coldhead> i deserve it
[17:21:58] <tripflex> so i'm looking at using json inside the dataType in .ajax to handle errors
[17:22:18] <tripflex> i'm going to have PHP parse the json and send it to the .ajax call
[17:22:43] <tripflex> does this sound possible?
[17:22:54] <tripflex> monk3y|afk, no more afk :)
[17:23:27] <tripflex> api.jquery says malformed json is rejected iwth parse error
[17:23:45] <tripflex> but does that parse error specify anything or is it just that a parse error
[17:25:39] <tripflex> i'm just trying to "pass" the error from php to the .ajax call
[17:25:53] <tw2113> coldhead, no holiday pay until you're past the 2nd day
[17:32:15] <razic> heyâ€¦ how are you guys using `grunt watch` to build and lint files while working on them locally.
[17:32:37] <razic> it will run the task suite once, but after that it won't run it anymore
[17:33:49] <razic> am i doing something wrong? i followed the readme
[17:45:50] <rmurphey> razic: you may want to try #grunt
[17:46:00] <razic> I did.
[17:46:03] <razic> They gave me the solution.
[17:46:17] <razic> Turns out it 's only a problem for editors with Safewrites like VIM
[17:50:14] <claudioprv> any brasilian here?
[17:55:05] <coldhead> we are all brazilians
[18:00:40] <zg> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh696634.aspx
[18:00:55] <zg> why does MSDN have an article on console commands, yet Internet Explorer doesn't support console commands? lol
[18:02:23] <zg> how do I get the individual character of a text element
[18:02:41] <zg> i'm doing .contents().each()
[18:02:57] <zg> if(this.nodeType === 3) input_data.before_cursor += $(this).text();
[18:03:07] <zg> but that's not returning the individual character, it's returning the entire text node's contents
[18:03:22] <zg> this when I type "asdf", it puts in aasasdasdf
[18:05:05] <zg> nvm, figured out what I was doing wrong
[18:08:35] <coldhead> great work zg
[18:08:46] <zg> ???
[18:09:22] <coldhead> i am happy for you, good luck
[18:10:42] <tripflex> so .width() is returning the PX value, is there a way to obtain the percentage?
[18:13:52] <tw2113> you could probably grab the parent dom's width as well, and then do the math
[18:14:01] <tripflex> yeah that's what iwas afraid of
[18:14:08] <tripflex> i was hoping there was an easier way :)
[18:15:13] <zg> coldhead: sarcasm much? :(
[18:15:20] <tripflex> http://jsfiddle.net/strikernl/y3P3A/
[18:15:21] <tripflex> haha bleh
[18:15:48] <tripflex> so yeah i either need to calc it myself or go back to 1.5 haha
[18:17:27] <monk3y> Oh wait .. tripflex is here ..
[18:17:34] <tw2113> tripflex, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/744319/get-css-rules-percentage-value-in-jquery
[18:17:36] <tripflex> hah
[18:17:49] <monk3y> Okaaaay, you got meeee.
[18:17:52] <zg> coldhead: http://term.qt.io/
[18:17:59] <zg> type something, left + right arrows :D
[18:18:05] <zg> direction pad works :)
[18:18:20] <zg> tw2113: ^
[18:18:21] <tripflex> i was going to just use the parent width
[18:18:35] <tripflex> multiply current px width by 100
[18:18:41] <tripflex> and divide by parent width
[18:18:54] <tw2113> the link shows a lot of the same idea
[18:19:07] <zg> tw2113: ?
[18:19:12] <zg> oh
[18:19:51] <tripflex> what does the parsefloat do for it though
[18:20:02] <zg> 33.333333333333333 -> 33
[18:20:02] <monk3y> tripflex: did you get an answer to your musings about json/errors before?
[18:20:04] <zg> iirc
[18:20:09] <tw2113> i imagine parse float numerals
[18:20:22] <zg> The parseFloat() function parses a string and returns a floating point number.
[18:20:22] <zg> This function determines if the first character in the specified string is a number. If it is, it parses the string until it reaches the end of the number, and returns the number as a number, not as a string.
[18:20:25] <tripflex> yeah looks like it just checks if first character is a number
[18:20:25] <coldhead> i like the font zg
[18:20:29] <zg> coldhead: thanks :)
[18:20:33] <tripflex> :)
[18:20:33] <zg> ubuntu mono
[18:20:43] <tripflex> monk3y, nah i decided to go a different route
[18:20:57] <tripflex> i'm passing the http error code from the curl function to the php file
[18:21:15] <tripflex> now i just need to figure out what to do with that when sending it to the ajax
[18:21:21] <tripflex> figured id just write something to check for 200
[18:22:14] <monk3y> Ok so lemme get this straight; you're calling .ajax, which calls the PHP, which calls CURL - then if/when CURL returns an error, you bubble that back into the PHP, then back to the .ajax call (and into success: or error:, depending on the result)?
[18:22:19] <tripflex> i dont see why you would need to check with parsefloat though?
[18:22:31] <tripflex> monk3y, you got it
[18:22:35] <zg> is there a way to tell if you've already reached an element in $(selector).contents().each() without setting a boolean
[18:23:03] <tripflex> because all php is returning to ajax is the response
[18:23:15] <tw2113> tripflex, do you want to deal with a bunch of percent decimal precision?
[18:23:19] <tripflex> so i decided to just use the response as the "status" message to append to the user on screen
[18:23:35] <zg> basically, can this be shortened: http://pastie.org/5595761
[18:23:38] <tripflex> yeah i guess your right
[18:24:12] <zg> I was thinking about trying to split $('.input') contents by the cursor element, though I don
[18:24:16] <zg> I don't know if that's possible
[18:24:25] <zg> $('.input').split($('.cursor')) ? :P
[18:26:25] <monk3y> tripflex: I think where we got to before I left was that you only needed to display the progress message.  You didn't need to react differently for success/errors, etc.
[18:26:54] <tripflex> well i just don't want to keep going if there is an error
[18:27:02] <tripflex> but for now i'm not too worried about it, i can figure that out later
[18:27:18] <tripflex> tw2113, that actually doesn't work
[18:27:27] <monk3y> Ah.  So that's where your s < n is going to keep marching-on, error-or-not.
[18:27:30] <tripflex> since i'm using fluid setup
[18:27:34] <tripflex> the parent is a percentage as well
[18:27:49] <tripflex> so i'm going to use the offsetparent().width
[18:27:53] <tripflex> give it a try
[18:27:57] <tw2113> i googled
[18:28:10] <zg> heh: $('.input').html().split('<span class="cursor">'+$('.cursor').html()+'</span>')
[18:28:18] <zg> clever me
[18:28:24] <zg> SUCK IT COLDHEAD
[18:29:49] <tapmodo> oyyy
[18:29:55] <snover> iâ€™ve made that same request many times zg, it doesnâ€™t work out very well
[18:30:12] * monk3y shudders
[18:30:16] <zg> snover: whats wrong with your text
[18:30:19] <snover> so many teeth
[18:30:24] <monk3y> I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT!
[18:30:33] <zg> LEARN TO UTF-8 BITCVH
[18:30:34] <monk3y> The teeth thing!  But I thought it was too far!
[18:30:34] <monk3y> heheh
[18:30:43] <zg> heheh
[18:31:03] <snover> it is utf-8
[18:31:11] <tripflex> monk3y, yes that's correct ... figured i would just have something check with an if statement for 200 or something
[18:31:13] <tripflex> not sure yet
[18:31:36] <tripflex> but i guess that could have been done with json too :P
[18:31:43] <monk3y> Can I see another paste of your latest code?
[18:31:44] <tripflex> having httpstatus as one
[18:31:45] <zg> snover: give me an example
[18:31:47] <zg> of what would break it
[18:31:53] <zg> snover: http://term.qt.io, open console
[18:31:55] <tripflex> yeah sure gimme a minute let me get this width one done
[18:31:56] <snover> zg: i donâ€™t know what you are talking about
[18:32:13] <zg> you said
[18:32:17] <snover> i was just responding to your comment to coldhead
[18:32:18] <zg> <snover> iâ€™ve made that same request many times zg, it doesnâ€™t work out very well
[18:32:22] <zg> oh
[18:32:26] <zg> hahaha
[18:32:43] <snover> iâ€™m sure your html serialising wizardry is perfect and will never ever break horribly
[18:33:23] <monk3y> 'cause I'm thinking it could be just as simple as "if (s < n || data == 'DONE_ERROR') .."
[18:33:47] <snover> i might suggest that you look at the dom 2 traversal specification though
[18:33:47] <monk3y> s/==/!=/;
[18:34:17] <tripflex> yeah me too
[18:37:00] <monk3y> Oh man my 'if' stmt was just ridonculous.  You know what I mean.
[18:37:12] <tripflex> monk3y, i think something like in_str would be best
[18:37:26] <tripflex> need to google it to see what jquery would be
[18:37:46] <monk3y> You mean checking data for in_str 'error' or something like that?
[18:38:12] <tripflex> ah well actually
[18:38:26] <tripflex> i could use a jquery selector for a div that shows the error
[18:38:33] <tripflex> and then have a specific div that colors it red or something
[18:38:36] <tripflex> maybe
[18:38:37] <tripflex> hm
[18:38:52] <zg> tripflex: what're you trying to do
[18:39:06] <tripflex> well that's what i'm determining now haha
[18:39:25] <tripflex> i have a php file being called that i have an http error code i can send to ajax
[18:39:34] <tripflex> just trying to figure out how i would want to do it
[18:40:01] <tripflex> whether it be using a js if statement or who knows
[18:40:03] <tripflex> many options :)
[18:40:05] <monk3y> tripflex: like I said, and to make this simple; if you're *just* displaying a string of status, then just return dataType: text and push that into the div.
[18:40:16] <zg> how do I convert .html() ("&nbsp;") to .text() (" ")
[18:40:24] <monk3y> But, if you really want to check-for and react cleanly to errors .. start thinkin' about putting it in JSON.
[18:40:49] <tripflex> yeah but my concern is once there's an error i don't want it to call the function again
[18:41:08] <tripflex> right now it's basically using ajax as a proxy so to speak
[18:41:20] <tripflex> to display output taken from the php file on the screen
[18:42:00] <tripflex> monk3y, what i meant by that is, that's how i have it setup right now
[18:42:49] <tripflex> i just need to figure out how to make the ajax call react to the data returned and prevent it from calling the function again
[18:42:58] <monk3y> Yeah I know - that's why you need to have the PHP file send back an error, then check for that in the ajax success: function.
[18:43:08] <tripflex> yea
[18:43:12] <tripflex> so looks like
[18:43:36] <tripflex> if (str.match("Error:"))
[18:43:45] <tripflex> haha
[18:44:06] <tripflex> str.search str.indexof or str.match
[18:44:10] <monk3y> As we said: dataType: json, then in the PHP: echo { 'status': 'ERROR', 'progress': '75' }
[18:44:29] <monk3y> You *could* .. but string-introspection is a code-smell.
[18:44:33] <monk3y> Don't do it unless you have to.
[18:44:44] <tripflex> haha okay json it is then
[18:44:50] <monk3y> Putting everything in a JSON structure is just cleaner, and means you can add other status codes along the way.
[18:45:03] <tripflex> yeah plus makes it easier to add on to later
[18:45:26] <monk3y> Excellent.  I'm glad you've changed your mind.  I have to declare now that I'm on commission from the JSON Company (TM).
[18:45:42] <monk3y> Every time someone sends a new request with a JSON payload, I get cash.
[18:45:43] <tripflex> :P nah i was reading up on it earlier when you were gone
[18:46:11] <tripflex> i wanted to use json after you mentioned it but figured at least for now it's "semi-working" haha
[18:47:07] <monk3y> Heh sure, but I'm on a project right now where a lot of the parts are 'semi-working', but extending them is a nightmare.  So I'm cleaning up where I can.
[18:47:33] <tripflex> yeah exactly the reason i came in here to ask from people like you to make sure i was at least on the right path
[18:47:37] <tripflex> here's what i've got now
[18:47:38] <tripflex> http://jsfiddle.net/qp7tr/
[18:48:06] <tripflex> oops forgot to remvoe the width testing i was doing
[18:48:07] <tripflex> http://jsfiddle.net/qp7tr/1/
[18:49:04] <tripflex> so now i just need to convert it to json
[18:51:18] <monk3y> Yeah looks cool.  The part I'm still funky about is that, for .ajax's error: to fire, your response has to have a HTTP error-code in it.
[18:51:43] <tripflex> oh that's not even really needed
[18:51:58] <monk3y> Well .. that's the only way error: is going to get fired.
[18:52:02] <tripflex> i just kept it because i wrote it then realized ajax wasnt doing the error handling
[18:52:35] <monk3y> Yeah ok.  Ajax will do the error-handling if the web-page/server have issues etc, and return anything but HTTP 200 in the headers, right?
[18:52:38] <tripflex> yeah but ajax is calling the upgrade.php file which should always work if your able to call it
[18:52:57] <tripflex> the upgrade.php file is connceting to my server to get the update file
[18:52:57] <monk3y> Well it'll always work if it's processed, rendered and served back fully, sure.
[18:53:08] <tripflex> if there's an error upgrade.php will push that to ajax through the data response
[18:53:26] <tripflex> before i thought about that i wrote that error: section
[18:53:38] <monk3y> But yeah I think we're still on the same track; your PHP is containing any "business logic" errors and sending that back into the .ajax's 'success' function.
[18:53:50] <tripflex> yup you got it
[18:53:55] <tripflex> ahha got me confused mysefl at first
[18:53:59] <tripflex> reason that error: is in there
[18:54:51] <monk3y> Well yeah, my original thinking was handling any issues from the web-page/server aswell though.  'cause your page is going to have to display *something* if any infrastructure goes wrong.
[18:55:07] <tripflex> ;)
[18:55:10] <monk3y> (it's improbable, but just making sure you handle the case, etc)
[18:55:18] <tripflex> yessir
[18:55:35] <tripflex> i can always change it later on
[18:55:40] <tripflex> i just need to get hte basic function working
[18:56:02] <tripflex> so the user can update the plugin directly from the browser
[18:56:23] <tripflex> i'm creating a plugin for a hosting billing software that will allow users to automatically install addon modules from github
[18:56:38] <tripflex> first step is to allow them to upgrade my plugin directly from the install
[18:56:44] <tripflex> from the web browser that is
[18:57:15] <tripflex> i think this will make it a lot easier to get people on board to help working on these open source projects
[18:59:29] <monk3y> Sounds fair.
[18:59:44] <tripflex> now i just need to figure out how to parse the jason inside the ajax callback
[18:59:49] <tripflex> jaja
[18:59:50] <tripflex> jason
[19:00:44] <danheberden> tripflex: if returning json, set `dataType: true` in your config object for the ajax request
[19:00:49] <danheberden> oops
[19:00:53] <danheberden> `dataType: 'json'`
[19:01:06] <danheberden> that will clue jQuery in to run the result through JSON.parse()
[19:02:04] <tripflex> yeah i meant referencing the vlaues
[19:02:07] <tripflex> so i hsould be able to do
[19:02:17] <tripflex> data.httpstatus
[19:02:22] <tripflex> and that shoudl give me
[19:02:40] <tripflex> 200 out of "httpstatus":"200"
[19:03:25] <danheberden> correct
[19:03:32] <danheberden> assuming your data is parsed successfully/properly
[19:03:40] <danheberden> thus, assuming you're returning proper json :)
[19:03:51] <tripflex> yeah well i'm going to just use php to encode it
[19:03:56] <tripflex> so it "should" be correct
[19:03:56] <tripflex> hah
[19:04:03] <tripflex> can you use html inside a jason variable?
[19:04:05] <tripflex> BLAH
[19:04:09] <tripflex> i keep typing jason
[19:04:23] <vladikoff> JasonDScott___?
[19:04:34] <tripflex> ah i see then you can use .each to loop through?
[19:05:27] <danheberden> tripflex: you can pass any string in JSON
[19:05:40] <tripflex> ok great, thanks
[19:10:55] <monk3y> tripflex: why will you need to iterate through the HTML in your response?  Are you pulling pieces out and doing things with them?
[19:11:14] <tripflex> yeah i was thinking about just using jquery to add what i need though
[19:11:22] <tripflex> just need to format the way it looks on screen
[19:11:26] <_cb> If I use http://ajax.googleapis.com/... on a page with an ssl then IE (windows seven) has the security warning. Any option other than doing https://ajax.googleapis.com/
[19:11:33] <tripflex> haven't gotten to that point yet though
[19:11:40] <tripflex> changing everything to json right now
[19:11:44] <monk3y> I thought you were just going to do something like; { 'httpstatus': 'xxx', 'htmlMessage': '<div><span>75%</span></div>' }
[19:11:59] <tripflex> yes in theory
[19:12:02] <tripflex> but there's many ways to do it
[19:12:12] <tripflex> that's the easier
[19:12:18] <tripflex> but wasn't sure if i wanted to pass html through json
[19:12:43] <monk3y> Yeah 'course.  Essentially I'd prefer you just return this; { 'httpstatus': 'xxx', 'progress': '75' }
[19:12:55] <monk3y> .. then display it how you like on the client-side.
[19:13:52] <monk3y> So within the success function; $('#targetDiv').html('<div><span>' + data.progress + '%</span></div>');
[19:15:47] <tripflex> you got it
[19:15:51] <tripflex> oh man that was easy
[19:15:53] <tripflex> haha
[19:16:02] <tripflex> json_encode(myphparray)
[19:16:35] <vladikoff> _cb, maybe something like this will help you https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/v4.0.2/index.html#L27 (line 27)
[19:16:37] <tripflex> man i spent like 20 minutes looking though google and "json .ajax"
[19:16:38] <tripflex> haha
[19:17:24] <tripflex> _cb, that's a very open statement
[19:17:28] <monk3y> Really?  oOOOOooh heh sorry dude, I've been writing stuff like that all night.  Thought you knew it was that.
[19:17:31] <tripflex> depending on what the browser has in it for trusted sites
[19:17:49] <tripflex> it will still warn about insecure content though
[19:18:09] <tripflex> if you're trying to include something in a secure page you should make sure it's secure content
[19:18:14] <tripflex> otherwise the browser will bitch
[19:18:40] <tripflex> haha no worries monk3y i'm just glad it was that easy
[19:26:06] <tomasm-> hi, I'm trying to insert content from a json call into the page..... since the response may be plain text or may be html, I always wrap it with <div> and then insert into the dom and then strip the container, since I do things like fading in, etc. problem is sometimes i get snippets of html, such as parts of an html table.... like "<tr><td>one</td><td>two</td></tr>" .... which I've seen does not wrap nicely around <div></div> . it takes the in
[19:26:06] <tomasm-> side text and strips the td
[19:26:11] <_cb> If I load  query via <script src="https//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js" .. then IE on windows 7 complains of insecure content on any page that has https. Looks like if I do <script src="//ajax.googlea then WIndows 7 is happy. Is that the way to get around the IE warnings?
[19:26:18] <tomasm-> any idea why?
[19:26:29] <_cb> Sorry it should be If I load  query via <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js" .. then IE on windows 7 complains of insecure content on any page that has https. Looks like if I do <script src="//ajax.googlea then WIndows 7 is happy. Is that the way to get around the IE warnings?
[19:27:09] <vladikoff> _cb, just use // ???
[19:27:27] <vladikoff> _cb, what else do you need?
[19:28:14] <_cb> vladikoff that is what I tried and seems to work but have not done extensive testing. Seems a bit retarded that using http://ajax... would give you security warning and //ajax... would not. It's the same site!
[19:29:16] <_zoggy_> sounds like http vs https
[19:29:31] <_zoggy_> // uses the same protocol as page
[19:29:51] <_zoggy_> so you are changing protocols more than likely. mix match of insecure and secure
[19:30:03] <vladikoff> _cb, you can read more about this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/550038/is-it-valid-to-replace-http-with-in-a-script-src-http
[19:30:05] <_cb> Ahh so in effect doing //ajax is the same thing as doing https://ajax
[19:30:17] <_zoggy_> yes and no
[19:31:57] <tomasm-> anyone know of a way to detect between properly wrapped html (that $() will interpret properly) versus ill-formatted content (such as "ignored<div>kept</div>" or "invalid text"), that won't get interpretted properly by $(...) ? I'm trying to insert content into the DOM but sometimes it's text (without a container) and sometimes html
[19:32:06] <tw2113> is it just me, or are there an unusual amount of people stuck on version 1.4?
[19:32:19] <danzik17> tomasm-: they're stripped because they're not valid children of a div.  are you using jquery 1.8+?
[19:32:24] <_cb> Isn't <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script> a common way to load jquery? And if it is how do you get around the winows 7 mix match of insecure and secure warning on an https page?
[19:32:52] <snover> _cb: replace http:// with //
[19:33:02] <_cb> Ok, confirmed. Thanks!
[19:33:05] <snover> and get rid of the type attribute, it is not necessary
[19:33:10] <tw2113> and if you can, move yourself up to 1.8
[19:33:31] <tripflex> if(!data.httpstatus == 200) return: false;
[19:33:38] <tripflex> will that exit from a function?
[19:33:45] <_cb> Thanks for all the suggestions!
[19:33:52] <snover> tripflex: no
[19:34:31] <_cb> tw2113 is that 1.8.0 or simply 1.8?
[19:34:49] <tripflex> how would i do that then?
[19:35:10] <tw2113> just 1.8 would do
[19:35:27] <tw2113> i just tested and http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8/jquery.min.js gives you 1.8.3
[19:35:39] <tw2113> so google is smart enough to handle the urls
[19:35:50] <tomasm-> danzik17, 1.8.2 .... i just need to find a way to be able to contain both table rows and plain text via $( ) ... problem is the plain text gets stripped because there is no valid html container... hence the div's (which dont work for tr's). i get arbitrary content in a string, sometimes it's just plain text and sometimes it's html
[19:36:02] <_cb> tw2113   a lot of online tutorial, the ones I read at least, have 1.4.. in their examples. Thanks for the help.
[19:36:13] <tripflex> monk3y, you there?
[19:36:13] <tw2113> they must be old tutorials then
[19:36:22] * monk3y bes here
[19:36:31] <tripflex> if(!data.httpstatus == 200) return: false;
[19:36:35] <tripflex> how would i make that correct
[19:36:43] <tripflex> to exit the function
[19:36:47] <monk3y> Ah.
[19:36:54] <tripflex> so it doesn't execute loadStep
[19:36:55] <danzik17> tomasm-: don't pass it to $() directly - explicitly use $.parseHTML, so do $( $.parseHTML(data) )
[19:37:07] <monk3y> You're trying to get out of the bit before you load the next step eh .. I typed this before in the buffer..
[19:37:11] <tw2113> 1.4.* were all in 2010
[19:37:40] <monk3y> tripflex: "if (s < n && data.httpstatus != 200) { loadStep(s+1); }
[19:37:46] <tripflex> ahh
[19:37:48] <tripflex> haha durr
[19:38:14] <monk3y> (although my if stmt from before was broken)
[19:38:31] <monk3y> *however*
[19:38:40] <tomasm-> danzik17, why cant i find that in the docs?
[19:39:03] <monk3y> If you *are* going to check for errors and display/react accordingly .. you'd really need to make the if a little smarter.
[19:39:16] <tripflex> if(s < numSteps && data.httpstatus == 200) loadStep(s + 1);
[19:39:18] <tripflex> :)
[19:39:20] <tripflex> thanks man!!!
[19:39:20] <danzik17> tomasm-: because they haven't written docs for it yet.
[19:39:30] <tripflex> yeah but for now this is fine
[19:39:36] <tomasm-> danzik17, but that will do both jobs?
[19:39:37] <tripflex> does basic check for 200
[19:40:04] <tripflex> so when it gets a response other than 200 it won't call the function again
[19:40:07] <danzik17> tomasm-: both jobs?  it will parse what you provide it as HTML
[19:40:08] <monk3y> tripflex: approach it this way instead; if (data.httpstatus != 200) { [display error] } elseif (s < numSteps) { etc }
[19:40:32] <tripflex> 			$('#upgradestatus').append(data.statusmsg);
[19:40:33] <tripflex> 			if(s < numSteps && data.httpstatus == 200) loadStep(s + 1);
[19:40:34] <tripflex> :)
[19:40:35] <monk3y> That way you're reacting to an error - and stopping the loop - or you're continuing the loop, until it's done.
[19:40:47] <tomasm-> danzik17, yeah i mean whether i give it a string or an html fragment, so $() doesnt ignore plain strings.... i will try it out
[19:41:04] <tripflex> it appends the statusmsg first then checks for the step number and correct http code to continue
[19:41:10] <tripflex> i see what you're saying though
[19:41:23] <danzik17> tomasm-: it'll work.  if it's passed a plain string, you'll be returned a text node.
[19:41:30] <tripflex> because remember the php file is just acting as a proxy for the http code
[19:41:31] <tomasm-> good
[19:41:33] <tripflex> just pushing it through
[19:41:46] <tomasm-> danzik17, thanks
[19:41:49] <tripflex> so i'll set the statusmsg in the php file if there's an error
[19:42:04] <tripflex> i mean ill set the error msg in the statusmsg if there is one
[19:49:26] <monk3y> tripflex: yeah I remember the proxy deal, that's cool.  I'm just thinkin' about whatever comes back from the server-side to the ajax success(data) function.
[19:49:33] <monk3y> That's all we need to concentrate on.
[19:49:49] <monk3y> But do you have control over what the PHP file is 'proxying'?
[19:50:03] <tripflex> yes complete control
[19:50:16] <monk3y> Can you change the output from the original source, or are you just wrapping/decorating it with the PHP then sending that JSON package back.
[19:50:21] <monk3y> Ok.
[19:50:31] <monk3y> So you can add a another property to the JSON as httpstatusMessage?
[19:50:45] <monk3y> So there'll be a httpstatus, httpstatusmessage, and payload?
[19:52:23] <tripflex> well here's what i'm doing
[19:52:31] <tripflex> i'm using curl to get the file from my server
[19:52:43] <tripflex> taking that data and writing it to a new file
[19:53:04] <tripflex> i then send whatever i want as an output to ajax
[19:53:24] <tripflex> so for right now i've got it sending the json with httpstatus and statusmsg
[19:53:42] <tripflex> but the actual data that i'm using CURL for is processed in the backend of php
[19:53:49] <tripflex> so ajax never even sees it
[19:54:08] <tripflex> oh man i love it when things work correctly
[19:54:09] <tripflex> :D
[19:54:45] <tripflex> so right now i've got this code in the php file that ajax is calling
[19:55:18] <tripflex> echo getafileJson('http://website.com/file.php');
[19:55:51] <tripflex> which calls that function that encodes the json with the httpcode from that page and the data received from the page as the statusmsg
[19:55:54] <tripflex> if i do
[19:55:58] <recognosco> i have this line: "getDevices().done(function(result){" and i get this error: "Cannot call method 'done' of undefined". i do have the function and it's doing that needs to do. any idea on what might be going on?
[19:56:02] <tripflex> echo getafileJson('http://website.com/file.php', "My Message");
[19:56:18] <tripflex> it displays My Message instead of the output from file.php
[19:56:24] <tripflex> so now the sky is the limit!
[19:56:28] <tripflex> :D :D :D
[19:57:02] <vladikoff> more like tripflex is the limit
[19:57:05] <tripflex> it's quite confusing even for me because there's 3 different layers
[19:57:19] <tripflex> i agree
[19:57:27] <tripflex> call of duty is one too
[19:58:13] <tripflex> monk3y, i do wnat to say i appreciate all your help man you don't know how much time you have saved me
[20:00:23] <monk3y> No sweat dude.  I'm no pro at this, but it's good to know I'm helping a little.
[20:00:52] <tripflex> we were all noobs once :)
[20:00:57] <monk3y> But bide your time, sooner or later I'll give you a line of code that, if not picked up by shoky et al immediately, could be a sublte bug you won't find for weeks.
[20:01:07] <monk3y> s/sublte/subtle/
[20:01:10] <tripflex> so if you have any server questions you send them my way because i am a pro at that
[20:01:11] <tripflex> haha
[20:01:20] <monk3y> oOOOooh .. server questions ehhhh.
[20:01:30] <tw2113> it's like you start to learn something the more you use it
[20:01:45] <tripflex> yeah i own a hosting company and we're a govt contractor
[20:01:46] <monk3y> How does mod-rewrite work? (heheh)
[20:02:01] <tripflex> so we have a public and govt division
[20:02:15] <tripflex> govt it mainly networking and construction
[20:02:30] <tripflex> public is just that websites, vps, colo, etc
[20:02:38] <tripflex> haha it works with apache
[20:02:39] <tripflex> :P
[20:02:53] <recognosco> do i have return anything from a function to use done()?
[20:03:01] <recognosco> have to*
[20:03:43] <monk3y> recognosco: from your code snippet I think it means getDevices() isn't returning an object, because you're calling .done on whatever it returns.
[20:03:59] <monk3y> (and it's saying that you're calling .done on Undefined .. so it's not returning anything)
[20:04:34] <monk3y> tw2113: yeah man I'm trying to shore-up what I know by helping others .. and then learning if (when) I'm corrected :)
[20:04:54] <tw2113> do what i do, state that you're happy to be wrong
[20:05:12] <monk3y> Oh heavens no.  If I did that, my girlfriend would win *every* day.
[20:05:23] <monk3y> We. Can't. Have. That.
[20:05:30] <tw2113> who said to a woman
[20:05:31] <tw2113> i meant in here
[20:05:41] <monk3y> heheh k
[20:05:47] <monk3y> I thought you were giving me life advice.
[20:05:58] <monk3y> I guess this isn't #fridgeMagnet.
[20:06:18] <tw2113> if she ever asks, claim we're #watercooler
[20:06:19] * monk3y guzzles more red wine and attempts to be funny
[20:06:22] <monk3y> Heheh
[20:08:47] <tripflex> haha mine is #biblestudy
[20:09:00] <tripflex> but she's working ,hence the reason i can get shit done
[20:09:01] <tripflex> haha
[20:09:17] <recognosco> monk3y: i don't understand what you mean exactly. i am new to js, so please excuse my ignorance. this  my code: http://jsfiddle.net/74Gmy/
[20:11:47] <tw2113> ahh, the reason why we get 50 libraries that accomplish the same goal: "There are many other wonderful libraries that do similar things, but none of them worked exactly how I wanted them to work or met all the goals above."
[20:12:41] <monk3y> tw2113: I had a similar conversation in #cakephp last night, wrt PHP libraries/frameworks.
[20:12:42] <monk3y> Sigh.
[20:13:23] <monk3y> Why couldn't programming frameworks be more like fashion; everyone just follows a majority, blindly, and only a select few try to innovate.
[20:13:48] <tw2113> at least both industries steal from each other freely
[20:13:55] <monk3y> If only we had more models :(
[20:14:02] <monk3y> And I *don't* mean the DB kind :/
[20:14:05] <tw2113> we do, it's called porn
[20:14:13] <monk3y> True.  True.
[20:14:16] * monk3y alt-tabs
[20:14:18] * monk3y alt-tabs back
[20:14:21] <monk3y> True.
[20:16:38] <monk3y> recognosco: I'm not familiar with the jQuery couch db plugin.  What object do you think you're returning from $.couch.db(blah).view()?
[20:17:02] <monk3y> 'cause you're trying to call .done() on whatever 'that' returns.
[20:17:55] <monk3y> But in the anonymous function that you pass to .view(), you seem to be eventually either calling 'displayDevices()', or 'console.log()'.
[20:18:05] <monk3y> Neither of these make me confident that you're actually returning something.
[20:18:21] <monk3y> .. and then you're calling .done() on something I don't think you're returning.  Etc.
[20:19:40] <recognosco> monk3y: it basically does an ajax call inside and returns the result in an array i think
[20:20:08] <recognosco> var view = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(data)); << data is what i get returned
[20:22:01] <recognosco> moneal_,
[20:22:22] <recognosco> monk3y: yeah, it returns he data of ajax call.
[20:22:36] <Eviltwin> Ugh, that JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...)) trick is so inefficient
[20:23:05] <recognosco> Eviltwin: i am new to js. sorry about that.
[20:24:12] <monk3y> recognosco: ok, as much as I can Google about .couch.db().view(), I don't think setting view = anything will make it return that.
[20:24:27] <monk3y> And .ajax doesn't 'return' anything, as far as I can see from the jQuery page, and as much as I've used it.
[20:24:31] <danheberden> Eviltwin: is that to take malformed json and make it an obj?
[20:24:39] <danheberden> that makes my skin crawl
[20:24:53] <monk3y> You just assign functions and it executes them, and you modify your DOM to reflect/update/display data.
[20:25:10] <danheberden> monk3y: it returns a jqXHR
[20:25:14] <danheberden> as does all the ajax methods
[20:25:19] <danheberden> which has a built-in promise
[20:25:29] <danheberden> or, rather, the promise methods are integrated into it
[20:25:48] <monk3y> In success it does, right?  The function you attach to success has the XHQR as a parameter .. right?
[20:26:07] <monk3y> But have a look at recognosco's pasted code .. he's trying to return whatever ajax 'does'.
[20:26:54] <monk3y> Whereas what I think he needs to do (this is for you, recognosco), is to put the #devices_table modification call into displayDevices().
[20:26:58] <danheberden> monk3y: no, the return value
[20:27:01] <recognosco> *feels like he has committed a crime :/
[20:27:11] <monk3y> recognosco: it's cool man, we're just trying to work it out.
[20:27:19] <danheberden> `var request = $.ajax( opts ); // request is a jqXHR.
[20:27:31] <monk3y> danheberden: as I said, I couldn't see that it explicitly returned anything from the jQuery API page, but if I overlooked my apologies.
[20:27:32] <danheberden> `request.then( function(data) { /* do something with data */ });
[20:27:42] <monk3y> Ok cool.
[20:27:44] <danheberden> monk3y: no apology needed - just adding the info if you didn't see it
[20:27:51] <danheberden> it's a wayward beast, $.ajx
[20:27:56] <danheberden> *$.ajax
[20:28:09] <danheberden> well, just complex - but that's to be expected
[20:28:26] <recognosco> oh. hmmm. right after displaying - i can make it a datatable there! indd
[20:28:40] <recognosco> indeed
[20:28:49] <recognosco> so it stays in the scope
[20:29:06] <monk3y> danheberden: yeah I hadn't seen anyone consume/use the return val from .ajax before .. until I just paged-down to the examples on the jQuery page.
[20:29:30] <monk3y> Everyone else/every other use has been in-place; ie. tag an anonymous function onto success and "do stuff there".
[20:29:35] <danheberden> monk3y: it helps so much - like, if you do anything re: app architecture
[20:29:41] * monk3y updates his knowledge of stuff
[20:29:54] <danheberden> backbone-boilerplate and backbone-layoutmanager use them
[20:30:02] <monk3y> Use the XHQR return val?
[20:30:03] <recognosco> moneal_,
[20:30:08] <monk3y> heheh @ moneal_.
[20:30:12] <danheberden> monk3y: yeah, but it's the promise that's awesome
[20:30:18] <danheberden> cuz in one area of your
[20:30:24] <danheberden> better yet:

[20:30:36] <recognosco> monk3y: i tried using the error code on error from ajax call yesterday
[20:30:58] <recognosco> monk3y: i am new js
[20:31:29] <monk3y> recognosco: I hear ya man (/girl?), totally understood.  It seems you're learning along with me ;)(
[20:31:45] <monk3y> Waaaaait.
[20:31:48] <recognosco> man is just fine
[20:31:54] <monk3y> danheberden: that's you in the vid?  You're famous 'n' stuff?
[20:35:12] <Eviltwin> danheberden: The JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...)) thing is poor man's deep copy
[20:35:18] <Eviltwin> For non-cyclic structures
[20:36:04] <recognosco> Eviltwin: what would be a better way to do that
[20:36:50] <monk3y> Don't you just set dataType: json, then you can access all the properties/members by data.blah?
[20:38:14] <danheberden> Eviltwin: oh! lol
[20:38:33] <danheberden> monk3y: ha, hardly
[20:40:11] <danzik17> recognosco: lodash has a good implementation of deep/shallow clone: https://github.com/bestiejs/lodash/blob/master/lodash.js#L1024-L1092
[20:40:36] <Eviltwin> jQuery has $.extend({}, ...) and $.extend(true, {}, ...)
[20:41:15] <Eviltwin> They're not super optimized though
[20:41:25] <recognosco> hmmm
[20:41:48] <recognosco> i have to learn this extend magic of jquery
[20:42:18] <monk3y> Then Google like a madman.
[20:42:28] <Eviltwin> Or browse api.jquery.com
[20:43:03] <monk3y> Heheh, why send him straight to the comfortable warmth of the source of truth, instead of sending him into the wild??

[20:46:14] <tw2113> or just out there

[21:12:06] <aaairc> i want to use Isotope (http://isotope.metafizzy.co/demos/sorting.html) to sort my elements... but then i want a way to automatically select the next element after the currently selected element in accordance to whatever sort Isotope has applied.
[21:13:11] <aaairc> does anyone know if this is possible? the problem is that isotope reorders the elements without actually affecting the order of where the elements appear in the DOM, so I can't just use jQuery to get the next element as I normally would.
[21:35:05] <vladikoff> aaairc, no easy way AFAIK, maybe have your own sort as well, then you will know the order and can get the item with JS

[22:01:26] <rabbi1> zg: how many span's u got in a span ?
[22:01:35] <zg> just 1
[22:01:43] <zg> I need to get only the contents of input
[22:01:51] <zg> but remove all the cursor's
[22:01:55] <zg> but don't remove the cursor contents
[22:02:04] <zg> so <span class="input">pw<span class="cursor">d</span></span>
[22:02:10] <zg> would, with something, return pwd
[22:03:03] <rabbi1> .removeClass('cursor'); should do
[22:03:50] <zg> I need to remove the span tags but leave the innerHTMNL
[22:03:58] <zg> s/innerHTMNL/innerHTML/
[22:05:21] <raj> if I do `$('#selector').data('myarray', [1,2,3]); myvar = $('#selector').data('myarray')`, if I modify myarray, why doesn't it automatically change $('#selector')'s data property?

[23:12:21] <sheilablackrose> hi guys i have this code  <a class="btn-add-dialog solid hasuploader"  id="<%: browsefilesId %>">
[23:12:21] <sheilablackrose> 				Upload File
[23:12:21] <sheilablackrose> 			</a> it works in chrome n firefox but not in ie.
[23:12:28] <sheilablackrose> can anyone helpp with this
[23:13:30] <voidpirate> Does it show up?
[23:13:36] <voidpirate> Can you send link to the site?
[23:13:37] <sheilablackrose> yup
[23:13:43] <sheilablackrose> just nothing happens when i click
[23:14:36] <rabbi1> what is the content of 'browsefilesId' in ie source file ?
[23:14:38] <voidpirate> O.o
[23:15:33] <sheilablackrose> it gets a unique id
[23:15:33] <ryanneufeld> sheilablackrose: are you using the form type?
[23:15:40] <sheilablackrose> yeah
[23:15:45] <ryanneufeld> sheilablackrose: have you googled how to make an upload form?
[23:15:57] <sheilablackrose> yup
[23:16:05] <sheilablackrose> it runs fine in othe rbroser
[23:16:08] <sheilablackrose> browsers
[23:16:53] <ryanneufeld> well sheilablackrose, you know the ropes here, you've been around long enough
[23:17:03] <sheilablackrose> js fiddle huh
[23:17:07] <sheilablackrose> ok will try to recreate it
[23:17:25] <ryanneufeld> sheilablackrose: pasting small snippets of code is completely useless
[23:17:32] <sheilablackrose> yeah i thought
[23:17:33] <sheilablackrose> so
[23:17:45] <sheilablackrose> i was actually hoping to get lucky n might have been a small issue with the syntax
[23:17:46] <ryanneufeld> so...?
[23:17:59] <sheilablackrose> ill try recreate it n come back later
[23:18:01] <ryanneufeld> looks like you're using ASP?
[23:18:06] <sheilablackrose> yeah i am
[23:18:17] <sheilablackrose> everything is dynamic so its always hard to recreate it :)
[23:18:19] <voidpirate> Why don't you just use a simple input form?
[23:18:20] <ryanneufeld> Perhaps an ASP support channel would be a good place to check?
[23:18:27] <sheilablackrose> will do my best n come back later
[23:18:36] <sheilablackrose> the channles dead
[23:18:37] <sheilablackrose> :p
[23:18:46] <sheilablackrose> ok guys ill b back later
[23:18:47] <voidpirate> ASP is dying :)
[23:18:47] <ryanneufeld> since your problem has nothing to do with jquery, asking in here isn't really appropriate
[23:18:50] <sheilablackrose> you all have a pleasant sunday
[23:18:54] <coldhead> THIS IS WHY CHANNELS GO DEAD SHEILABLACKROSE
[23:19:02] <voidpirate> n00b
[23:19:03] <coldhead> BECAUSE YOU GO AWAY
[23:19:15] <sheilablackrose> hahaha
[23:19:25] <voidpirate> don't leave us!
[23:19:31] <sheilablackrose> wait are you saying teh channel turns dead because im here or because i left
[23:19:37] <ryanneufeld> yes
[23:20:29] <coldhead> when you find a dead ASP channel you're duty bound to stay there talking until you bring it back to life
[23:20:34] <coldhead> or are duly banned
[23:20:47] <sheilablackrose> hahaha ok
[23:20:49] <voidpirate> bring back the asp!
[23:20:53] <sheilablackrose> but today im going to have a beer
[23:21:09] <sheilablackrose> n plan my new year eve
[23:21:30] <voidpirate> ASP is more important
[23:21:45] <sheilablackrose> voidpirate im sure the channel will b there when i get back
[23:21:52] <sheilablackrose> :)
[23:22:04] <sheilablackrose> ok guys take care n have fun
