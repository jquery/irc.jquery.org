[00:02:47] <iYuri> Spadeski, it seems like your code is a bit messy
[00:03:23] <coldhead> all code is messy
[00:03:36] <Spadeski> iYuri yeah its a plugin i got
[00:04:02] <coldhead> ?beauty

[00:26:53] <libryder> hello
[00:27:22] <Kambfhase> ?hi @ libryder
[00:27:23] <bot-t> Hey libryder
[00:27:26] <libryder> i have a pretty cool method to remove classes that match "____"
[00:27:35] <libryder> omg i made a whale on accident
[00:28:22] <libryder> $('selector')[0].className = $('selector')[0].className.replace(/\bvalidate\[.*\]/g, '');
[00:28:52] <libryder> that is what i am using to manually remove validationEngine classes from all inputs on the page
[00:29:00] <Kambfhase> http://www.woosk.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/whale.jpg
[00:29:32] <libryder> lol
[00:30:30] <Kambfhase> so, what was your question again?
[00:31:18] <libryder> oh, well i struggled on how to sytematically remove a class that matched some regex on the entire page, and i wanted to share my solution
[00:31:24] <libryder> i'll surely blog about it
[00:32:54] <libryder> in my provided example, it was a part of $('#form').find('input').each(function() {
[00:32:56] <Kambfhase> you might want to make your .* non-greedy. and maybe use .attr('class',functio(i, old){ })
[00:34:09] <libryder> Kambfhase: i'm interested in improving my regex, let me gist the entire fuction
[00:34:32] <libryder> it's super short
[00:35:02] <libryder> https://gist.github.com/feec4a539903b685f540
[00:37:18] <Kambfhase> https://gist.github.com/781374695c8c6481240f
[00:37:28] <Kambfhase> I#d write it like that.
[00:38:19] <libryder> i don't have to iterate through the imputs?
[00:40:08] <Kambfhase> not if you use .attr() in combination with a function
[00:41:28] <libryder> it's simpler, but more sophisticated
[00:42:59] <Kambfhase> it's simpler, and more sophisticated
[00:43:03] <Kambfhase> I#d write it like that.
[00:43:46] <libryder> so the function passed into the value field is made available two values - the first (i) being the iteration and the second (old) being the matched element?
[00:44:10] <Kambfhase> i is the index and old is the old value of .attr('class')
[00:44:35] <Kambfhase> what ever you return will be the new value of the Elements .attr('class')
[00:45:12] <libryder> Kambfhase: thank you so much :D it's much cleaner
[00:45:19] <Kambfhase> :)
[00:45:46] <Kambfhase> btw, please test it first.
[00:45:52] <libryder> hahah definitely
[00:45:54] <Kambfhase> no guarantees
[00:46:23] <libryder> i'm still slightly confused by the hidden .each iterator
[00:51:38] <tPl0ch> Hello, I have the following problem. I have bound a change event to an input field, and the callback works correctly. But when I click on a ui-slider-handle, the change event on the input field won't trigger. Is this a common problem with jquery 1.4.2?
[01:30:59] <jac0bz1> Hi!
[01:31:20] <jac0bz1> http://jsbin.com/uwabiw/8/edit  <- Can anyone tell my why the callback is runned before the other (see console)
[01:35:55] <jac0bz1> nobody online?
[01:36:05] <azorai> yup
[01:36:20] <jac0bz1> :)
[01:36:32] <jac0bz1> Know anything about callbacks? :)
[01:36:45] <azorai> yes, what's ur problem?
[01:36:56] <jac0bz1> http://jsbin.com/uwabiw/8/edit  <-Callback is runned first :/ (Look at the console)
[01:39:15] <azorai> That's because you're calling onComplete when you pass it. Instead of `ctest('callback test',mCallback.onComplete('I\'m done!'));` you should be doing `ctest('callback test',mCallback.onComplete);`... and then passing "im done" within the ctest function
[01:39:25] <aaronmcadam> ah
[01:39:38] <aaronmcadam> no
[01:39:47] <aaronmcadam> you should pass it in an anonymous function
[01:40:08] <aaronmcadam> jac0bz1: function () { mCallback.onComplete('I\'m done!'); }
[01:40:22] <aaronmcadam> that's how u do it azorai
[01:40:29] <aaronmcadam> if u want to pass a custom param
[01:40:35] <azorai> It makes no difference... It depends where you want to specify the 'im done' message.
[01:40:48] <aaronmcadam> yea I meant that
[01:40:49] <azorai> But yes, if you want to specify it there, then an anony function works best.
[01:40:52] <azorai> :)
[01:40:53] <azorai> cool
[01:41:19] <aaronmcadam> i would like it if there was a sort of apply function for that instance
[01:41:28] <jac0bz1> tnx :D
[01:42:16] <azorai> You could hack a currying impl to make it cooler..
[01:42:28] <aaronmcadam> go on
[01:42:30] <aaronmcadam> :p
[01:43:24] <aaronmcadam> fiddle me azorai, fiddle meeee
[01:44:00] <azorai> I'm not sure if 'curry' is the correct term. Something like this: `function curry(fn, arg){ return function(){return fn.call(this,arg);}}` and then `curry(callbacks.onComplete, 'im done') ;. ... something like that.
[01:44:15] <aaronmcadam> ah
[01:44:36] <azorai> curry returns fn which can be called later. I'm sure there are better implementations does elsewhere
[01:44:38] <aaronmcadam> you might wanna pass the "this" too
[01:44:48] <azorai> yeh I guess
[01:48:01] <quicksilver> curry is totally the wrong word.
[01:48:09] <aaronmcadam> not exactly
[01:48:14] <quicksilver> defer, maybe. (although confusing with the other use of defer)
[01:48:22] <aaronmcadam> your still taking a function and picking certain params
[01:48:41] <azorai> Is this what partial application is?
[01:48:48] <azorai> sorry, confused with terminology.
[01:48:56] <quicksilver> yes.
[01:48:59] <aaronmcadam> bingoooooooo
[01:49:04] <quicksilver> partial application is when you supply only some parameters.
[01:49:26] <quicksilver> currying is when you turn a 2-parameter function into a 1-parameter function which returns a function (which expects the remaining parameter)
[01:50:00] <azorai> My bad... either way, even Resig gets confused between the two. See his post on partial application where he says it's the same as currying.
[01:50:12] <aaronmcadam> that's what i was told too
[01:50:44] <quicksilver> yes, resig is wrong.
[01:50:51] <aaronmcadam> In mathematics and computer science, currying is the technique of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments (or an n-tuple of arguments) in such a way that it can be called as a chain of functions each with a single argument (partial application).
[01:50:56] <azorai> Blasphemy :]
[01:51:16] <quicksilver> aaronmcadam: that's all correct up until the final parenthesis
[01:51:22] <quicksilver> which is slightly confusing
[01:51:24] <aaronmcadam> wiki is wrong
[01:51:26] <aaronmcadam> :D
[01:51:35] <azorai> hmm... so, according to that, it seems that currying is the technique that you use to gain partial application.
[01:51:39] <azorai> Damn...
[01:51:40] <quicksilver> (partial application is what we call it when we only supply some of those arguments)
[01:51:46] <aaronmcadam> yes
[01:51:48] <quicksilver> yes, currying makes partial application easier/more natural
[01:52:04] <azorai> ahh
[01:52:04] <quicksilver> although it rather restricts which argument you supply first
[01:52:19] <aaronmcadam> yea
[01:59:48] <safzouf> HI
[01:59:54] <safzouf> what does this selector means? :
[02:00:05] <WalterTamboer> Hello. Where can I find the jQuery changelog?
[02:00:24] <safzouf> $('.class1', container) ;
[02:00:26] <safzouf> for exampel
[02:00:40] <safzouf> why adding ",container" ?
[02:00:52] <safzouf> how this is useful?
[02:00:57] <aaronmcadam> safzouf: it gives it context
[02:01:08] <safzouf> how?
[02:01:12] <safzouf> ah
[02:01:14] <safzouf> you mean it is an Id?
[02:01:21] <aaronmcadam> it's the same as $( container).find( '.class' )
[02:01:47] <safzouf> what must be the nature of container
[02:01:49] <WalterTamboer> safzouf: $('.class1', container) ; means that you will be searching for all elements with the class "class1" within container.
[02:02:04] <WalterTamboer> container can be anything
[02:02:06] <aaronmcadam> safzouf: yeah, internally it just calls find anyway
[02:02:14] <safzouf> emmm
[02:02:25] <WalterTamboer> Where can I find the jQuery changelog?
[02:02:27] <safzouf> so same as: $(#container .class1)
[02:02:32] <safzouf> right?
[02:02:33] <milligan> Quick question. I have a php script that performs some actions. It echoes the string "SUCCESS" or something else if it fails. Can I, in a javascript, do: $.get('http://path/to/script', function(data) { if(data != "SUCCESS") {.. ?
[02:02:40] <aaronmcadam> WalterTamboer: in the blog posts
[02:03:09] <blackspotwiggins> WalterTamboer, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commits/master
[02:03:11] <safzouf> why using this transcription of contex?
[02:03:12] <blackspotwiggins> as well
[02:03:22] <aaronmcadam> milligan: you should return json, use json_encode
[02:03:23] <WalterTamboer> aaronmcadam: Thanks. I was searching like crazy...
[02:04:12] <WalterTamboer> safzouf: If the variable container equals "$('#container')" than it is the same yes. If the variable contains something else... well you catch the drift.
[02:04:17] <blackspotwiggins> WalterTamboer, fyi jquery changelog in google, the first result is blog :)
[02:04:18] <milligan> aaronmcadam, got a sample I could look at ?
[02:04:42] <safzouf> yes
[02:04:51] <safzouf> it can be DOM object
[02:04:52] <WalterTamboer> It's like aaronmcadam said. $(selector, context) is the same as  $(context).find(selector);
[02:04:53] <safzouf> div
[02:04:55] <safzouf> body
[02:04:59] <aaronmcadam> milligan: right here: in php, json_encode( Array( 'status' => 'success' ) )
[02:05:11] <safzouf> so using this context
[02:05:17] <safzouf> will abstract the nature of the contex
[02:05:19] <safzouf> right?
[02:05:24] <aaronmcadam> milligan: then in ur js, u can do if ( data.status === success ) ...
[02:05:26] <aaronmcadam> or else
[02:05:35] <WalterTamboer> blackspotwiggins: I saw that but I couldn't believe that a respectable framework like jQuery didn't have a dedicated page for changes. Now I know that it doesn't have one... ;)
[02:06:09] <WalterTamboer> We're using jQuery 1.6.2 in a product and now we are deciding if we need to upgrade... So I need to read through some blog posts to see if anything breaks our product... okay...
[02:06:32] <aaronmcadam> you should definately upgrade
[02:06:38] <aaronmcadam> 1.7 is nearly ready
[02:06:44] <aaronmcadam> test ur app with the rc
[02:07:01] <milligan> aaronmcadam, would this be valid as well, json_encode( Array( 'status' => 'FAILED', 'reason' => 'Didnt get expected prompt' ) ); ?
[02:07:11] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[02:07:36] <aaronmcadam> then you could do if ( data.status === 'FAILED' ) { console.log( data.reason ); }
[02:07:41] <blackspotwiggins> WalterTamboer, i think jquery versioning is usually semantic, so 1.6.2 -> 1.6.4 should be safe
[02:07:41] <milligan> yep
[02:07:46] <blackspotwiggins> there have been exceptions tho
[02:07:48] <milligan> alright, I'll give it a whack and see what happens
[02:07:51] <aaronmcadam> k
[02:07:57] <molavy> how can i check if response is json or not
[02:07:58] <molavy> ?
[02:08:23] <aaronmcadam> molavy: are u returning different data types?
[02:08:35] <molavy> parsejson throw exception if data is not json
[02:08:36] <molavy> yes
[02:08:42] <aaronmcadam> of course it does
[02:08:47] <aaronmcadam> it only accepts valid json
[02:08:47] <molavy> may html or may json
[02:08:52] <milligan> aaronmcadam, how come I need to use three = ? (data.status === success) .. and how would I write not equals ?
[02:09:09] <aaronmcadam> milligan: === is exactly equal, == uses type coercion
[02:09:36] <milligan> ah
[02:09:48] <aaronmcadam> milligan: for proper comparisons, especially strings, always use ===
[02:09:51] <molavy> any idea?
[02:10:07] <milligan> I want to use ' ' on the status though? So it's (if(data.status === 'success') .. ?
[02:10:19] <aaronmcadam> yep
[02:10:36] <aaronmcadam> what's the problem
[02:10:36] <milligan> And !== is the same as not equals ?
[02:10:50] <aaronmcadam> yes
[02:10:54] <milligan> cheers mate
[02:11:01] <aaronmcadam> ?eval 1 == true
[02:11:04] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: true
[02:11:05] <aaronmcadam> see
[02:11:10] <aaronmcadam> ?eval 1 === true
[02:11:11] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: false
[02:11:22] <aaronmcadam> milligan: ^^
[02:12:21] <molavy> no idea?
[02:12:37] <aaronmcadam> molavy: if parseJSON fails, then ur kno it's not json
[02:12:51] <aaronmcadam> could either try/catch it
[02:13:06] <aaronmcadam> or if ( !$.parseJSON( data ) ) ...
[02:15:54] <milligan> aaronmcadam, I need to echo the json_encode'ed value, right ?
[02:16:01] <aaronmcadam> yurp
[02:16:20] <aaronmcadam> print_r the encode first to check it
[02:22:57] <milligan> aaronmcadam, alert(data.status) return undefined .. but opening the page directly returns {"status":"FAILED","reason":"Could not connect!"}
[02:24:20] <aaronmcadam> don't use alert, use console.log and firebug
[02:24:31] <aaronmcadam> or chrome web inspector's console
[02:24:52] <aaronmcadam> jsfiddle your code. set data to that json
[02:29:22] <milligan> aaronmcadam, do I have to tell the script that the data it will return is JSON in any way ?
[02:31:20] <aaronmcadam> oh haha
[02:31:28] <aaronmcadam> milligan: jsfiddle the code ur trying
[02:31:36] <aaronmcadam> milligan: are u using getJSON
[02:31:51] <aaronmcadam> or $.ajax with a dataType: 'json'?
[02:32:02] <milligan> ahhh.. I was using .get .. >.>
[02:32:42] <aaronmcadam> milligan: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[02:32:50] <aaronmcadam> u can pass dataType as the last params milligan
[02:33:15] <milligan> .getJSON would be just as easy ? :)
[02:33:18] <aaronmcadam> yup
[02:38:01] <milligan> The page can't return any html when returning json ?

[04:07:48] <ThePeach> hi all
[04:08:40] <ThePeach> sorry for the completely unrelated question, I'm looking for a front-end developer full time in London, do you have any suggestions where to place the job advert?
[04:14:17] <Zxurian> if I want to use separate ajaxStart / ajaxStop events depending on user action, should I rather be using the $.ajax{beforeSend} option>
[04:14:19] <Zxurian> ?
[04:15:00] <aaronmcadam> milligan: nope
[04:15:35] <aaronmcadam> Zxurian: probably
[04:15:52] <aaronmcadam> those ajax methods set options globally
[04:15:58] <Zxurian> thats what I thought
[04:16:24] <Zxurian> the docs say it's more geared to special headers, but there's no reason I can't use it for that purpose, unless i'm missing something
[04:16:41] <aaronmcadam> what exactly are u trying to do
[04:17:10] <Zxurian> I have two ajax forms on a single page, and I have different loader graphics for both of them
[04:17:29] <Zxurian> I don't want both of them firing when one form is sent
[04:17:39] <aaronmcadam> right
[04:17:45] <aaronmcadam> use beforeSend to show the loader
[04:17:52] <aaronmcadam> and in ur success callback, hide the loader
[04:17:59] <blackspotwiggins> why is binding to ajaxstart a worse solution?
[04:18:10] <Zxurian> yea, actually using complete instead of success, so it'll fire regardless of success or error
[04:18:17] <aaronmcadam> yes
[04:18:26] <Zxurian> black: .ajaxstart() is a global call, which means anythign registered it will fire for any ajax call, not just specific ones
[04:18:30] <aaronmcadam> Zxurian: because beforeSend is what u want
[04:18:41] <aaronmcadam> it's not actually related to the ajax request
[04:18:47] <blackspotwiggins> well bind one action to one form, another to second form?
[04:18:52] <aaronmcadam> so it's best to use the method you're given
[04:18:59] <aaronmcadam> yes
[04:19:36] <aaronmcadam> or use .ajaxComplete()
[04:19:36] <Zxurian> yes, using beforesend / complete for it, just checking to make sure those functions wouldn't do anythign special that I didn't know about
[04:20:32] <aaronmcadam> yeah, the opposite of what u were using before
[04:21:00] <aaronmcadam> i.e. using methods do something special when you weren't
[04:21:10] <Zxurian> yup
[04:21:29] <aaronmcadam> would make it confusing to read later
[04:21:36] <Booster2ooo> Hello
[04:25:04] <Booster2ooo> Could anybody help me to dev a proper silder plugin ? http://pastebin.com/ZmShKYs1
[04:25:42] <Booster2ooo> I coded the "old crappy one", but it's quite messy and I wanted to recode it as a jquery plugin with events instead of timers
[04:26:04] <Booster2ooo> But I must admit I'm a big noob and I don't know what to do next on the plugin code :'(
[04:26:56] <aaronmcadam> why don't u just use one that's gonna be infinitely better
[04:27:01] <aaronmcadam> anything slider is decent
[04:28:19] <aaronmcadam> haha yeah
[04:28:25] <aaronmcadam> use a plugin off the shelf
[04:29:05] <Booster2ooo> aaronmcadam > because using an existing one won't help me learn how to code one ;)
[04:29:31] <aaronmcadam> Booster2ooo: https://github.com/ProLoser/AnythingSlider
[04:29:33] <Zxurian> never reinvent the wheel if you don't have to. better to take an existing wheel apart then try and invent a new one.
[04:29:34] <Booster2ooo> and I want something special, not the same sliders you see on all websites
[04:29:51] <aaronmcadam> customise this one then
[04:30:22] <aaronmcadam> and there's only so many ways to slide a bloody image lol
[04:30:35] <eugenmayer> are there any "select a bunch of Users" UI elements know / tips?
[04:30:46] <aaronmcadam> tho nivo is quite cool http://nivo.dev7studios.com/
[04:31:20] <Booster2ooo> It is
[04:32:44] <Booster2ooo> but I need a 2 levels slider with a specific way of sliding 2nd level images (not really sure this one is "understandable" ^^)
[04:32:55] <aaronmcadam> nope
[04:33:18] <aaronmcadam> do u mean thumbnails showing underneath the slider?
[04:33:54] <Booster2ooo> In fact it's sliding in a 2 level array. It's an array of array of images
[04:34:01] <aaronmcadam> Booster2ooo: like this? http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/pager3.html
[04:34:22] <aaronmcadam> right
[04:34:23] <Booster2ooo> No, wait a sec, gonna upload a poc
[04:34:36] <aaronmcadam> kk
[04:36:05] <Booster2ooo> aaronmcadam > http://78.129.251.120/slider/slider.html
[04:36:27] <Booster2ooo> You see, the images slides, and the it swith an go to the next "tab"
[04:36:53] <aaronmcadam> wtf
[04:37:20] <Booster2ooo> it switches and goes to the next tab*
[04:37:23] <aaronmcadam> ah i think I can *sort of* understand
[04:37:36] <Booster2ooo> like, in the 1st tab, there are 5 imgs
[04:37:41] <deebo> is there some way to add a global .fail() on all jq.when calls?
[04:37:49] <aaronmcadam> there is?
[04:37:51] <Booster2ooo> when the 5 images are done sliding,it goes to the next "tab"
[04:38:26] <Booster2ooo> and it slides the 3 images of this tab, then go to the next tab (or the first one if it's the last one)
[04:38:55] <aaronmcadam> deebo doesn't look like it
[04:39:05] <aaronmcadam> I guess you could hack it a bit
[04:39:11] <deebo> hmpf,. guess ill wrap it then so i can add a global one
[04:39:20] <aaronmcadam> maybe $.Deferred.prototype.fail = yourfunc?
[04:39:23] <aaronmcadam> something similar?
[04:39:39] <aaronmcadam> deebo: I refactored a function to call my ajax yeah
[04:39:46] <aaronmcadam> deebo: probably easiest to do it that way
[04:39:53] <deebo> nah, ill just return $.when(arguments).fail(...), let the user add .done()
[04:40:00] <aaronmcadam> yes
[04:40:21] <aaronmcadam> i can paste u my func if u want
[04:40:26] <deebo> sure
[04:41:46] <aaronmcadam> deebo: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/wVkdC/
[04:43:03] <aaronmcadam> deebo: any use?
[04:43:30] <deebo> sure, except i dont use $.ajax directly
[04:43:48] <aaronmcadam> ah just whack a when in there?
[04:44:18] <aaronmcadam> why not deebo?
[04:44:22] <deebo> already have utility functions that return $.ajax so i can just $.when(getajax('url'), getajax('url2')).done(function(url, url2) { });
[04:44:31] <aaronmcadam> ah good good
[04:44:59] <aaronmcadam> deebo, except, that when will call the function, not pass it
[04:45:23] <aaronmcadam> you'll need to do: $.when( function() { getajax('url') } ....
[04:45:30] <deebo> guess i can just directly return $.when and pass it all the arguments the function gets, just like var defer = function() { return $.when(arguments).fail(.. default fail handler ..); }
[04:46:16] <deebo> aaronmcadam: aaronmcadam getajax() returns $.ajax which is a deferred object (jqxhr)
[04:46:25] <aaronmcadam> ah right cool
[04:46:30] <aaronmcadam> the promise
[04:50:28] <ll_> hey i got some problem i got a json var in my js file and after processing it i wanne store it into a file can somebody give me a clue how to do it ?
[05:04:23] <aaronmcadam> ll_ you want to save the json to a file?
[05:04:42] <aaronmcadam> lampe2: ^^
[05:05:09] <lampe2> aaronmcadam,  yes
[05:05:19] <aaronmcadam> lampe2 have u heard of couchdb or mongodb?
[05:05:35] <aaronmcadam> lampe2: json dbs
[05:05:35] <lampe2> aaronmcadam, i wanne save it to a txt or .json file
[05:05:41] <lampe2> not to a db
[05:05:44] <aaronmcadam> lampe2: you're gonna have to pass that back to the server
[05:05:51] <paul_uk> hey all, window.open is being blocked because it's 2/3 levels away from the onclick event.  Is there anyway to fool the window.open that it's next to the onclick event ?
[05:05:55] <aaronmcadam> lampe2: unless you're using node?
[05:06:19] <aaronmcadam> paul_uk: window.open seems to trigger popup blocking whatever happens
[05:06:23] <lampe2> aaronmcadam, simple jquery
[05:06:30] <blackspotwiggins> lampe2, it's gonna be hard on the clientside, if you want to store it on server, post it
[05:06:33] <blackspotwiggins> and let server handle it
[05:06:35] <aaronmcadam> lampe2: you're gonna have to pass it back to ur server
[05:06:52] <lampe2> the client is the server
[05:06:57] <aaronmcadam> hahah what
[05:07:04] <NodeX> aaronmcadam : I wouldnt exactly call MongoDB a json db lol
[05:07:11] <blackspotwiggins> WAR IS PEACE
[05:07:15] <blackspotwiggins> FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
[05:07:15] <aaronmcadam> it's simpler to explain it that way
[05:07:19] <lampe2> aaronmcadam, everything is on one pc
[05:07:21] <blackspotwiggins> IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
[05:07:30] <aaronmcadam> u still have a server?
[05:07:34] <aaronmcadam> on your localhost
[05:07:38] <paul_uk> aaronmcadam, nope, it's working fine for me when the popup function is in the click callback
[05:07:43] <lampe2> aaronmcadam, localhost
[05:07:49] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[05:07:57] <aaronmcadam> php?
[05:08:07] <aaronmcadam> a server doesn't need to be on another machine u know
[05:09:31] <aaronmcadam> unless u wanna start messing with the File API but can that read dirs?
[05:09:32] <lampe2> http://pastie.org/2761648 i got this var and now i wanne save this var to a txt file in josn format
[05:09:46] <aaronmcadam> yeah lampe2 so what, you're gonna have to use a server side language
[05:10:24] <lampe2> aaronmcadam, so php
[05:10:28] <aaronmcadam> lampe2: right
[05:10:48] <blackspotwiggins> that is sooo not a #jquery topic tho
[05:11:11] <aaronmcadam> i never really care about whether it's a #jquery topic :D
[05:11:24] <NodeX> heh
[05:12:14] <aaronmcadam> but yeah I'd rather not have to remember the shit code involved with file handling with php
[05:12:43] <Xotix> hi, http://tinyurl.com/3zhqh8m if you go there, it should show 231 if you reload 248 if you reload with without cache (ctrl shift r on windows i think) it is again 231 and then again 248, why?
[05:14:13] <seutje> shows 228 on load for me
[05:14:16] <aaronmcadam> wtf are u alerting?
[05:14:34] <Xotix> $('#editor table:first thead').outerHeight();
[05:14:39] <seutje> refresh -> 230, refresh again -> 228 again
[05:15:13] <Xotix> the js fiel is a bit a mess cause im trying out stuff. sry about that, it's at the end.
[05:16:12] <seutje> aw man, I'ma avert my eyes, this just hurts, sry
[05:16:21] <aaronmcadam> lol
[05:16:23] <aaronmcadam> sure does
[05:18:17] <JohnnyDavidson> If there was a percentage that something happened, would I do it like this? if(Math.random() * 100 < percentage); ?
[05:18:43] <aaronmcadam> do u mean probability?
[05:18:49] <JohnnyDavidson> yeah
[05:18:53] <aaronmcadam> jesus lol
[05:19:00] <JohnnyDavidson> Or is there a better way?
[05:19:01] <aaronmcadam> that's computer science right there :D
[05:19:41] <aaronmcadam> a random number turned into a percentage is probability? who'da thunk it
[05:19:49] <blackspotwiggins> random will never generate 1 tho
[05:19:55] <aaronmcadam> a pseudorandom number that is
[05:20:24] <aaronmcadam> is that from the spec?
[05:20:26] <blackspotwiggins> yea
[05:20:28] <blackspotwiggins> [0,1)
[05:21:23] <aaronmcadam> ah, it always returns floats
[05:21:26] <JohnnyDavidson> So what should I do then? Should I do *100+1?
[05:21:45] <aaronmcadam> and divided by 1 to get the percentage surely
[05:21:55] <blackspotwiggins> it depends on what you want to do
[05:21:58] <aaronmcadam> but what you're doing is not probability
[05:22:07] <aaronmcadam> there's no determining variables there
[05:22:14] <JohnnyDavidson> What do you mean?
[05:22:16] <seutje> just ceil?
[05:22:28] <JohnnyDavidson> say percentage = 20;
[05:22:35] <JohnnyDavidson> or probability
[05:22:36] <blackspotwiggins> just use 0.2
[05:22:44] <blackspotwiggins> it's better to never go to %
[05:22:44] <aaronmcadam> seutje: that will always return 1
[05:22:54] <aaronmcadam> ?eval Math.ceil( Math.random() )
[05:22:55] <seutje> aaronmcadam: nah, I mean *100 and then ceil
[05:22:55] <JohnnyDavidson> That's true, but I want my code to be more readable
[05:22:56] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: 1
[05:23:07] <JohnnyDavidson> As in letting people adjust the percentages
[05:23:15] <seutje> ?Eval Math.ceil(Math.Random()*100)
[05:23:17] <bot-t> seutje: TypeError: Math.Random is not a function
[05:23:18] <seutje> argh
[05:23:23] <seutje> ?Eval Math.ceil(Math.random()*100)
[05:23:25] <bot-t> seutje: 24
[05:23:26] <seutje> damned azerty
[05:23:35] <blackspotwiggins> JohnnyDavidson, that does not prevent you from using 0.2 behind the scenes
[05:23:46] <blackspotwiggins> your call tho, it's easier if you dont have convert back and forth
[05:23:54] <aaronmcadam> yea seutje cool
[05:23:55] <JohnnyDavidson> seutje that only works with whole numbers though
[05:24:00] <JohnnyDavidson> If it was 21.5234 or something
[05:24:08] <JohnnyDavidson> It would be equivilent to 22
[05:24:30] <aaronmcadam> random returns a float what's ur point?
[05:24:43] <JohnnyDavidson> he did Math.ceil
[05:24:47] <aaronmcadam> what are these percentages for?
[05:24:49] <JohnnyDavidson> which returns an int
[05:24:52] <aaronmcadam> yes
[05:25:35] <aaronmcadam> so just drop the ceil then
[05:25:44] <JohnnyDavidson> Then I would do +1
[05:25:53] <aaronmcadam> ?eval Math.random() * 100
[05:25:56] <seutje> wait, u want percentages as floats?
[05:26:06] <JohnnyDavidson> Why not?
[05:26:32] <aaronmcadam> or 25.678%
[05:26:35] <aaronmcadam> ?
[05:26:38] <seutje> how far?
[05:26:47] <seutje> like 16.666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666667%?
[05:26:53] <aaronmcadam> hahah yeah
[05:26:57] <aaronmcadam> what about 33.33333%
[05:26:59] <BREND> Hi all!,
[05:27:42] <JohnnyDavidson> Well it's going to be evaluated thousands of times
[05:30:30] <Xotix> why is the value from the demo i posted different? i just want the height of a theadâ€¦can't be that hard
[05:31:33] <seutje> ?Eval (function() { var i = 0; while (i!=100) { var rand = Math.random()*100; i =  Math.floor(rand) == 99 ? Math.round(rand) : rand; } return i; })();
[05:31:33] <bot-t1> seutje: 100
[05:31:57] <seutje> that's not right
[05:32:17] <seutje> 99.5 and up will never be returned as a float that way :/
[05:33:21] <seanh> Hey, I'm trying to understand some code. I've got $('.my-button').click(myFunction); then in myFunction there is a parameter e. I'm trying to figure out what this object e is, where it comes from, if there is any documentation
[05:33:35] <seutje> seanh: event
[05:33:56] <seutje> ?click @ seanh
[05:33:57] <bot-t1> seanh, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[05:34:15] <seutje> well, on the page it doesn't just say handler, but handler(eventObject)
[05:34:25] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, the probability of random generating any specific value is 0, so it's no biggie if you get 0.99999999999 instead of 1
[05:34:51] <seanh> I found click but it didn't point me to event
[05:34:59] <seutje> seanh: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/ more info on event objects
[05:35:19] <seanh> I'm looking at this now http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[05:35:28] <seanh> Yeah, thanks seutje
[05:35:33] <seutje> after or before I linked u? :P
[05:35:45] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: I know, I wouldn't give 2 shits myself
[05:36:23] <seutje> was just trying to solve his issue with my uneducated brain :(
[05:37:29] <m8> Hi, how i can select an element with class="foo bar" ?
[05:37:44] <m8> i've tried element[class=foo bar] but nothing
[05:38:01] <Xotix> $('.class')?
[05:38:05] <m8> (i've to do a multiple attribute selection)
[05:38:10] <m8> Xenc, look at the double class
[05:38:24] <seutje> $('.foo.bar')
[05:38:34] <seutje> "it's just css, mate"Â©
[05:38:34] <m8> input[type=text].foo.bar ?
[05:38:43] <seutje> perhaps
[05:39:02] <m8> input[type=text][otherattr=X][class=foo bar]?
[05:39:04] <seutje> I'd prolly use input.foo.bar[type=text] though
[05:39:14] <m8> it's a complex query
[05:39:18] <seutje> dude, if there's a space in it, use quotes
[05:39:46] <m8> seutje, it works thanks
[05:41:25] <seutje> lol, was typing out an example fiddle with one hand whilst on the phone
[05:41:28] <lampe2> is there a way to write a file on the client pc?
[05:41:50] <beasty> why does seutje sounds dutch?
[05:42:39] <seutje> ?Translate seut from dutch

[05:43:36] <seutje> lampe2: not sure how to do it without activeX shizzle
[05:43:38] <beasty> so u're from antwerp ? :p
[05:44:03] <seutje> the Google is strong in this one
[05:45:01] <beasty> neu shit
[05:46:25] <Xotix> http://tinyurl.com/3zhqh8m why is the value changing when refreshing?
[05:46:27] <iateadonut> how would i find the width of .class2 and apply it to .class1?
[05:46:50] <iateadonut> to apply a width to class1: $('.class1').css('width','1054');
[05:47:30] <iateadonut> so, to get class2's width, something like, $('.class1').css('width',$('.class2').width); ?
[05:47:37] <beasty> +()

[05:48:38] <s3d_matt> In query - .ajax, how do you get the class and id of the selector which has been pressed / clicked?
[05:49:35] <beasty> $(this).attr('id') or .attr('class')
[05:49:53] <beasty> within the request
[05:49:56] <blackspotwiggins> if you are in a event handler
[05:50:00] <blackspotwiggins> this in a request is .. not
[05:50:01] <s3d_matt> beasty: thanks
[05:50:10] <s3d_matt> one other thing. Would do i use that within this:
[05:50:28] <s3d_matt> (from a form function) data: $('".$selector."').serialize(),
[05:52:44] <aaronmcadam> this.id or this.className
[05:52:57] <aaronmcadam> don't user attr() unless u actually need to
[05:53:42] <raar>  hi, i'm after adding some shadows to my div - does jquery support this natively or can someone recommend a plugin that supports jquery 1.4.x?
[05:54:03] <blackspotwiggins> raar, css3 box shadows
[05:54:12] <blackspotwiggins> not everything in webdev is a jquery plugin

[07:12:13] <consumerism> if i use $.each on an array with one element, is it significantly slower than simply running the code in the callback function?

[07:20:57] <milligan> aaronmcadam, this .getJSON is working perfectly in firefox, chrome, etc .. but failing in i.e9 .. it never gets executed. What could be the prob you reckon ?

[07:23:03] <ibike365> hello everyone
[07:23:27] <aaronmcadam> milligan: have u tried just "index2.php" as the url?
[07:23:39] <aaronmcadam> or '/index2.php'
[07:23:41] <milligan> hmm .. lemme give it a go
[07:23:57] <ibike365> is there a way to fire the change event on a checkbox when you are programatically settings the checked attribute true/false?
[07:24:14] <aaronmcadam> ?trigger @ ibike365
[07:24:14] <bot-t> ibike365, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[07:24:15] <milligan> aaronmcadam, /index2 or ./index2 ?
[07:24:22] <aaronmcadam> no, just /
[07:25:30] <aaronmcadam> milligan, ur logic is a bit weird
[07:25:54] <aaronmcadam> data.status !== 'success' would catch 'redirect' too
[07:26:03] <milligan> Yep
[07:26:10] <milligan> But redirect is caught up front, so that's fine
[07:26:11] <aaronmcadam> pass status as 'fail' or something
[07:26:12] <ibike365> how could i forget about trigger() ugh
[07:26:20] <aaronmcadam> then you know
[07:26:24] <aaronmcadam> in 2 separate ifs
[07:26:27] <aaronmcadam> mayb
[07:26:41] <milligan> Agreed aaronmcadam .. I'll look into changing it as soon as I get this IE f**** to work
[07:26:53] <aaronmcadam> it could be the logic that ie is falling over who knows
[07:27:16] <milligan> Nah. The JSON isn't getting executed at all
[07:27:23] <milligan> index2.php is never loaded.
[07:27:39] <aaronmcadam> what does happen
[07:28:00] <milligan> the index.html that has the script in it loads, and the images on there.. and the jquery.js gets loaded, then nothing
[07:28:01] <aaronmcadam> console.log something above your if statements
[07:28:21] <milligan> From the paste, everything up till $.getJSON gets run..
[07:28:23] <aaronmcadam> how are u triggering your code milligan
[07:28:24] <maZtah> is it possible to slide these menu items one by one from left to right? http://jsfiddle.net/rwrhW/

[07:29:39] <milligan> aaronmcadam, I need to type window.setTimeout .. ?
[07:30:11] <aaronmcadam> window just namespaces the call
[07:30:16] <milligan> no, that's not right, because the method gets run
[07:30:24] <aaronmcadam> yes it is,
[07:30:26] <aaronmcadam> lol
[07:30:37] <aaronmcadam> setTimeout is a function on the window object
[07:31:00] <milligan> IE9 requires window. is prepended?
[07:31:22] <aaronmcadam> does it require?
[07:31:38] <aaronmcadam> you should be using window anyway

[07:35:42] <milligan> looks like it worked aaronmcadam :D
[07:36:05] <cuongnda> hi all, is this posible to bind click function to children element when parent element is already bind to another function?
[07:37:01] <emilkarl> Why isn't the container sliding? It just toggles on/off...
[07:37:01] <emilkarl> http://pastie.org/2762234
[07:38:02] <cuongnda> eg. I have a big div tag, contains numbers of buttons, Is this posible to bind function to buttons + div (when click on other area) as well?
[07:39:04] <maZtah> http://jsfiddle.net/rwrhW/1/
[07:39:08] <maZtah> I want all <li>'s to start from the left, then drop 'Home' in place, slide further to the right, drop 'Another page' in place, slide further to the right, drop 'Third' and the finish with 'Contact', is this possible anyways?
[07:40:07] <maela> hi everybody
[07:40:16] <jklmnop> cuongnda: .delgate()
[07:41:18] <maela> is there anyway to do an slideUp() without making element height = 0? I wnat to have a div with a minimun height and just slide up and down, between [min heignt - max height]
[07:42:27] <jklmnop> maela: .slideUp has a callback argument. use that to set the element's min-height
[07:44:38] <Xotix> which event gets triggered if you do a successfully resorting with sortable?
[07:46:19] <jklmnop> Xotix: sortupdate?
[07:47:06] <japherwocky> is it possible to load jquery via an eval() of the src?
[07:47:49] <maela> jklmnop: isn't this callback called when animation is finished?
[07:47:58] <Xotix> jklmnop: http://jsfiddle.net/vsUTP/1/ if you turn on firebug console. shouldnt i get "change" on every change in the list?
[07:48:28] <maela> jklmnop: I don't want the div to go to 0 height and then reset for example 100px. won't be nice to the eye :/. am I missing something?
[07:48:59] <xec> Xotix: http://jsfiddle.net/vsUTP/3/
[07:49:05] <yan_nick> what's going on here? why i have so many confirms???
[07:49:06] <yan_nick> http://jsfiddle.net/X7Q6n/3/
[07:49:20] <jklmnop> maela: you may have to write your own animation sequence
[07:49:35] <Xotix> xec a yeah..ups thanks
[07:50:05] <rabbi1> guys, help with datatables ...!!!
[07:50:09] <rabbi1> running out of time ...
[07:50:20] <maela> jklmnop: using animate?
[07:50:20] <jklmnop> Xotix: wrap your update callback with an anon function wrapper
[07:50:22] <karstenk1977_> hello
[07:50:28] <jklmnop> maela: yes
[07:50:54] <karstenk1977_> How can I ask, if my selected element is in the same container as a other special?
[07:51:35] <xec> define "a other special"
[07:52:05] <karstenk1977_> is the div active in same selector as el
[07:52:09] <poseid> hmm.... trying out blur() sample code in jsbin ..
[07:52:10] <poseid> http://jsbin.com/ededaw
[07:52:34] <maela> jklmnop: ok. Thanks. This is what I'm trying now. The problem is that how could I know the height that will show all the text my div contains? I start with a div of 100px and then I want to resize to full size (animation is working right now :))
[07:52:39] <poseid> thinking it is failing ...
[07:52:55] <aaronmcadam> don't use blur
[07:53:00] <aaronmcadam> use focusin/focusout
[07:54:34] <maZtah> anyone can help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/rwrhW/1/
[07:54:36] <jklmnop> maela: hmm, not sure. want to make a fiddle to show me what you're doing?
[07:55:18] <hooloovo1> maZtah: can be done! don't have time to help right now tho.
[07:55:27] <hooloovo1> maZtah: you can use the animate function to do it.
[07:55:37] <zivester> I have a form with a bunch of inputs... i use .submit() on the form to capture "enters"  on one of the form inputs, i have a .change() event bound... whats the best way to prevent the form from submitting from within the .change() event?
[07:55:44] <yan_nick> maZtah: for() loop
[07:55:52] <karstenk1977_> or how can i ask for if two elements have the same parent element?
[07:55:58] <maZtah> hmm hooloovo1, good to hear
[07:56:04] <zivester> "enters".
[07:56:20] <poseid> aaronmcadam: thanks i see :  http://jsbin.com/inufub
[07:56:22] <hooloovo1> maZtah: i'd prolly use the li's index and decide based on that how far from the left to "drop" it
[07:56:25] <maela> jklmnop: sorry mate I'm deving on local right now, can't show you the page, but I can upload the code its simple
[07:56:50] <padolsey> karstenk1977_: I assume you mean same direct parent, since all elements have a common ancestor. So for equal direct parents. Use `if ($(el1).parent() === $(el2).parent()) {...}`
[07:56:51] <jklmnop> maela: you can use jsfiddle.com to make a simplified example
[07:57:06] <jklmnop> maela: jsfiddle.net, rather
[07:57:14] <karstenk1977_> thanks
[07:57:20] <maZtah> hooloovo1: but i need to put them all to the left first, how would you do thaT?
[07:57:47] <hooloovo1> maZtah: with css =)
[07:58:09] <maZtah> well, then the menu won't work for users who disabled js
[07:58:42] <hooloovo1> maZtah: in that case you can do the same thing with jquerys .css function. just set the css that puts it to the left with that.
[07:58:47] <jklmnop> maZtah: you should design your menu for sans-js firstâ€¦ then you wouldn't be in this pickle
[07:59:04] <maZtah> jklmnop: i've done that already
[07:59:33] <hooloovo1> another solution is to require JS, that's not so much to ask these days.
[07:59:42] <rabbi1> guys, using DataTable, getting this error while editing a row... "Notice: Undefined index: sEcho". Any suggestions ?
[07:59:51] <padolsey> hooloovo1: Yes, it is... especially for something as rudimentary as a menu.
[08:00:29] <luite> rabbi1: that looks like a php message
[08:00:29] <hooloovo1> padolsey: it depends on what kind of site it is on i suppose.
[08:00:46] <karstenk1977_> could it be right PADOLSEY?   state2 = el.up('.option').next('.toppings').parent() === $('.toppings.active').parent() ? 0 : 1;
[08:01:01] <rabbi1> luite: yeah it is, but its from DataTable, inside server_processing.php
[08:01:22] <rabbi1> luite: php channel won't help on frameworks :(\
[08:01:51] <padolsey> hooloovo1: True, but most of the time, the only reason for abandoning progressive enhancement seems to be developer laziness. It's not really that hard. With this menu animation case, it wouldn't be hard to add a `js` class to the <html> element and then style via CSS using that as the root selector...
[08:02:43] <luite> rabbi1: hm ok. you could disable those notices by modifying the error_reporting level
[08:03:10] <hooloovo1> padolsey: That's true. I often make sites that so heavy dependant on JS that it doesn't make any sense to make just the menu degrade to html tho.
[08:03:16] <rabbi1> luite: ufff, newbie, how could i do that?
[08:03:55] <aaronmcadam> rabbi1: php_ini
[08:05:09] <rabbi1> aaronmcadam: yeah, but, which one to disable, for this instance ?
[08:05:28] <aaronmcadam> rabbi1: i don't know what msg ur being given
[08:05:39] <luite> rabbi1: you can call error_reporting(E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE); before anything else in your script
[08:05:41] <aaronmcadam> can't read your monitor brooo
[08:07:22] <rabbi1> aaronmcadam: hope that helps, kindly ignore the language
[08:07:46] <aaronmcadam> what language
[08:08:41] <maZtah> why doesn't this change the margin-right to 20px of the <li>'s?
[08:08:42] <maZtah> http://jsfiddle.net/rwrhW/2/
[08:09:06] <rabbi1> luite: its that "sEcho" indexing problem
[08:09:20] <rabbi1> aaronmcadam: did you check your PM
[08:09:35] <aaronmcadam> rabbi1: no pms
[08:09:42] <rabbi1> aaronmcadam: kool

[08:10:49] <rethus> k, in which way can i handle data, which returned from this php-script... with parseJSON?

[08:37:38] <rabbi1> is there any article in the world of JSON, Table Grid explained step-by-step ?
[08:37:55] <jklmnop> skramy: what server side language are you using? if php, you can use curl

[08:38:48] <tPl0ch> Hi, I have a problem that a change event bound to a input type text field is not triggered when clicking on a ui-slider handle. Anybody knows why this might happen?
[08:39:25] <gnarf> http://jquery.org/team/
[08:39:28] <gnarf> @ircdearia
[08:40:48] <ravenzz> uh gnarf are you from the a-team too?
[08:41:03] <gnarf> I'm not on the board
[08:41:08] <ravenzz> you are
[08:41:10] <skramy> the other domain is not mine
[08:41:16] <skramy> and im trying to do this all w/o server side code
[08:41:28] <gnarf> skramy: see ?sop
[08:41:29] <bot-t> skramy, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[08:41:40] <ravenzz> skramy so who is the target?
[08:41:57] <skramy> an API that blocks YQL unknowingly (robots.txt)
[08:42:21] <ravenzz> can't you access that directly?

[08:45:03] <ravenzz> events != fund raising
[08:45:22] <gnarf> ravenzz: well actually for jQuery we make a decent chunk of the $$$ we have from events
[08:45:41] <gnarf> its prolly the biggest fundraiser, also prolly the biggest expense :)
[08:46:09] <tPl0ch> gnarf, that's why you need someone good at it to make profit > expense ;)

[09:04:30] <Whirl3d> good morning, is it necessary to check if an element has a class before adding it or can you just add it, knowing it will only be added once?
[09:05:11] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.6.2&fn=addClass
[09:05:25] <Whirl3d> if (!$(sel).hasClass("someclass")) {$(sel).addClass("someclass");}
[09:05:30] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: if (!elem.className && classNames.length === 1) {...
[09:05:32] <aaronmcadam> uhuh
[09:06:06] <Whirl3d> that's better than $("sel").addClass("someclass")
[09:06:12] <rabbi1> aaronmcadam: can you push me from the hilltop ? ;)
[09:06:46] <AaronDCampbell> Is there a method built in for saving state of elements (like cookies)?
[09:08:57] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: addClass already checks if the class exists
[09:09:03] <aaronmcadam> did u actually read the source
[09:09:09] <Whirl3d> aaronmcadam, thanks for the link. I was just gonna ask about it.
[09:09:42] <Whirl3d> so, it's okay to just use $(sel).addClass since checking for it in advance is redundant.
[09:09:53] <aaronmcadam> yes
[09:09:59] <Whirl3d> what about multiple classes?
[09:10:20] <Whirl3d> $(sel).addClass("classone classtwo");
[09:10:37] * Whirl3d using your tool to check for multiple classes.
[09:11:16] <Whirl3d> aha, so it checks for multiple classes as well! Excellent
[09:11:24] <aaronmcadam> lol
[09:11:41] <aaronmcadam> yeah, so check for the implementation before u try to add checks :D
[09:12:12] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: like people checking for an element with a select when $( '#..') fails silently
[09:12:28] <Whirl3d> Funny, I thought the source would be too difficult to understand, so I don't even look at it. LOL
[09:12:53] <Whirl3d> aaronmcadam, thanks for your help and for the advice.
[09:12:55] <aaronmcadam> the source viewer is awesome
[09:12:59] <Whirl3d> amen
[09:14:53] <Whirl3d> one more simple one: if I have a series of inputs inside a div and I want to check if the newly focused input is within the same div as the one I am blurring....what's the best way to check for that?
[09:16:11] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d: fiddle that please

[09:45:51] <devc> But when I access the Object, I need to use PageMap['character01'] because 'character01' is coming dynamically from a variable.
[09:46:14] <devc> so I couldn't use, for example PageMap.currentChar
[09:46:37] <Whirl3d> PageMap[currentChar] doesn't work?
[09:47:04] <devc> It does for some objects but sometimes the key comes back empty, even though it exists in the Objecty.
[09:47:34] <Whirl3d> then it sounds like the script returning the empty key is bad
[09:48:04] <bapi_> how can i set the value of a input box?
[09:48:15] <Whirl3d> $("input").val(someval);
[09:48:16] <asher^> hi all, i have what is probably a trivial query.. I have a string stored in a variable and would like to select the div whose id is the string stored in the variable. what is the correct syntax for that?
[09:48:30] <Whirl3d> $("#"+str);
[09:48:40] <bapi_> thanks
[09:48:58] <asher^> ty
[09:49:06] <devc> Whirl3d: I've looked at what it's trying to access with console.log('PageMap['+variable+']'); and it looks to be looking for the right key.
[09:49:24] <asher^> perfect, thanks so much Whirl3d
[09:50:10] <Whirl3d> devc, this is a perfect opportunity to let jsfiddle help. Wanna post a fiddle so we can see what's happening?
[09:50:23] <Whirl3d> asher, np
[09:50:28] <devc> I have an working URL, is that easier?
[09:50:36] <Whirl3d> sure, sometimes. LOL
[09:50:36] <devc> Or should I move it into a JSFiddle?
[09:50:57] <Whirl3d> how bout the url and if it's too involved, you can separate the problem into a fiddle.
[09:50:57] <devc> No preloader so bare with the loading ;) http://clients.jpgninja.com/kidzsmart.com/book02/
[09:51:06] <devc> I think it will be too involved.
[09:51:14] <asher^> does jquery usually play nice with ie6?
[09:51:29] <devc> But let's try. So if you look at line 196 of script.js you'll see what I'm trying to output.
[09:51:39] <Whirl3d> asher, does anything?
[09:52:01] <asher^> lol
[09:52:19] <asher^> im relying on it to turn pages
[09:52:19] <Hopsy> I can't find the three characteristics of the riedel lobe (in the liver) :(
[09:52:41] <Hopsy> oepz, wrong channel
[09:53:12] <Whirl3d> devc, I'm getting an error in chrome on 196. you too?
[09:53:16] <devc> Yep.
[09:53:22] <devc> that should be outputting 'false'
[09:53:31] <devc> but it can't find the key in PageMap
[09:53:57] <Whirl3d> so, comment out 196 and make sure console logs the correct info before it
[09:54:26] <devc> Done.
[09:54:27] <Whirl3d> what is objectID
[09:54:37] <Whirl3d> is it a string? or an object?
[09:54:50] <devc> in this case object Id is a variable stored in each of the instantiated objects
[09:55:08] <Whirl3d> that holds an object or a string?
[09:55:32] <Whirl3d> I would think that objectID would be a string, making objectID.container moot
[09:56:13] <poseid> c u later
[09:56:15] <detrate> can anyone recommend a plugin that helps me manipulate cgi parameters in a URL?

[09:56:36] <pifantastic> detrate: ^
[09:56:39] <tharkun> Good evening, i am using cascade (http://plugins.jquery.com/project/cascade) , and i am trying to use AJAX. Where can i find the documentation of this particular pluggin?
[09:57:01] <detrate> awesome, thanks
[09:57:38] <devc> Should be a string. I can double check now... brb. The reason for containerId is that we're accounting for two types of objects.. Characters (which are <span>'s with images inside them... and Environment objects which are <img>'s
[09:57:42] <pifantastic> tharkun: check the source here: http://dev.chayachronicles.com/jquery/cascade/index.html
[09:58:37] <Whirl3d> devc, if objectID is a string, then it is not going to make sense to type objectID.containerObj. Perhaps you meant containerObj.objectID
[09:59:00] <Whirl3d> but then containerObj would have to be a regular object with the property objectID.
[09:59:12] <tharkun> pifantastic: thanks i allready downloaded it, printed it but I am finding stuff totally unexpected. A bit frustrating for a javascript noob
[10:00:33] <devc> Sorry... objectId is an ID passed in of either "Character" or "Environment" objects, instantiated like var devc = new Character();
[10:00:42] <devc> in that case objectId = 'devc';
[10:01:35] <devc> so when I $(objectId.containerObj); it's returning the jQuery object of the character 'devc'.
[10:06:12] <devc> When I output objectId.containerObj ... console outputs HTML in both cases, but in Character object cases it outputs the [<span><img/></span>] and in Environment object cases it's just the <img/>
[10:06:36] <devc> I dunno console's syntax very well, just started using it a couple weeks ago. Does that mean one's an Array?
[10:06:47] <Whirl3d> but pageMap[somehtml] doesn't make sense
[10:07:14] <Whirl3d> you want to use the ID of the object, not it's contents
[10:08:28] <Whirl3d> are you assigning id attributes to container objects?
[10:08:44] <devc> right. I'm trying to look at PageMap[ $(objectId.containerObj).attr('id'); ]
[10:09:24] <wrongle> hey everyone, i have a bunch of ui components that are much easier to just roll bundled/minified with .css() included. is there a "fast" method for converting a stylesheet to jquery syntax?
[10:09:34] <Whirl3d> use  avariable for clarity: var pageID=$(objectID.containerObj).attr('id'); console.log(pageID);
[10:10:01] <devc> okay. hold on.
[10:10:04] <Whirl3d> if (pageID is undefined), then your character or environment classes may not be defining the element's id property correctly
[10:12:08] <devc> Okay. As we go I'm working locally so if oyu want something FTP'd just say so and I'll update it. So I made the var and the ID's coming back properly.
[10:13:09] <devc> well.. IT's coming back with a string that looks identical to the id of the object I'm trying to access, which is also correct in terms of what key of PageMap I'm trying to access.
[10:13:54] <batfastad> Hi everyone. Been working on a jquery drop-down menu... http://www.bigbikeeurope.com/menutest.html It's based on the approach taken here... http://www.noupe.com/tutorial/drop-down-menu-jquery-css.html   Obviously uses plenty of CSS3 effects which aren't fully supported at the moment, but it looks ok without. Just wondering whether that approach for a drop-down menu is any good... or would I better off sticking with superfish or another jquery p
[10:15:04] <Whirl3d> devc, what is the function of pagemap? what are you using it for?
[10:18:06] <devc> Keeping track of all objects on the page.
[10:18:38] <Whirl3d> Why do you need to do that?
[10:18:44] <devc> This is for a book so I animate in.... and when the user goes to the next page of the book, I animate out all the objects, and animate in all the new objects.
[10:19:17] <Whirl3d> assign the objects a pageClass and select all the objects on a page at once using $(".page1") for example
[10:19:58] <Whirl3d> then animate them using $(".page1").each(function () {$(this).animate({opacity:0, left:-300},2000,"easeOutBack", function () {$(this).hide();});});
[10:20:09] <devc> I could do that but I need to remember which build-in effect I used and reverse that
[10:20:24] <devc> So if I slide in the animations, I need to slide them back out to their original x,y coordinates.
[10:20:39] <Morkel> What is a good lib for line charts?
[10:20:42] <asher^> devc is one page visible at a time?
[10:20:48] <devc> asher^: yep.
[10:20:54] <Whirl3d> I would use the data object for each element
[10:21:01] <asher^> i just built this 5 mins ago
[10:21:05] <asher^> slides between pages
[10:21:36] <asher^> one slides off the screen and the next slides on, kind of like swiping on an iphone/ipad
[10:21:47] <asher^> is that what youre after?
[10:21:58] <Whirl3d> $("element").data({origPos:$(this).pos(), effect:"slideOutFast"})
[10:22:04] <asher^> mine are controlled by button clicks though
[10:22:48] <devc> also, if they get clicked I want to run a callback function but the actual HTML elements are sitting behind the "frame" (wooden surroundings) so when I click, I'm actually clicking an image, then calculating if the click is within the xy and x+width, y+height coordinates for each object... then returning the callback for each of the objects.
[10:23:19] <Whirl3d> is the fame clickable?
[10:23:44] <Whirl3d> *frame
[10:24:15] <asher^> that sounds very complicated
[10:24:41] <devc> Whirl3d:  right now it's not... I commented out the listener.
[10:25:29] <devc> .data could do the same thing I'm doing.. and then $('.page1
[10:25:46] <devc> oops... $('.page1').children(); should work
[10:25:50] <Whirl3d> So, you want the characters on the page to mosey in from all different directions, have their own click reactions and then mosey out before changing pages...data is your solution, imy
[10:25:54] <Whirl3d> *imo
[10:26:40] <devc> Yeah, sounds like it's a better option than I'm working towards :) I haven't heard of or used it before
[10:26:40] <Whirl3d> $(".page1").find(".characters").each(function () {var hideAnim=$(this).data("hide"), hideAnim();});
[10:26:48] <devc> but it's the same thing I'm doing, I think.
[10:27:20] <devc> Beautiful. Thanks... I'll be back in half an hour with that updated and let you know if it's working ;)
[10:27:33] <Whirl3d> good luck

[10:27:39] <monohymn> hi, I got something really simple I need help on... my javascript is extremely rusty...
[10:27:55] <Whirl3d> jquery is the rust preventative you need, my friend
[10:28:08] <monohymn> :D
[10:28:25] <asher^> i did something really simple for mine. on page load i set a variable, pageNum, to 1 and displayed the first page. whenever i click the 'next' button it uses the UI hide/slide, increments pageNum, and uses show/slide for the next page. the opposite for going back
[10:28:48] <karstenk1977_> hello
[10:28:58] <devc> asher^:  ;) The page switching isn't hard. I have that working -- what I'm trying to do's a bit more involved.
[10:29:09] <Whirl3d> asher, but before he can slide the pages, the elements of the page have to return to their "home" positions
[10:29:19] <monohymn> anyway, I was wondering if there was a simpler way to write the javascript for this: http://jsfiddle.net/monohymn/TRJ6y/6/
[10:29:34] <Whirl3d> which involves a bunch of custom animations, some scoot, some slide, some wiggle, etc.
[10:29:51] <Whirl3d> presumably, depending on the chracter ...
[10:29:54] <Whirl3d> lol
[10:29:54] <devc> Whirl3d:  you got it dead on the money. Thanks for the help let me go try and implement this.
[10:29:59] <asher^> hmm ok
[10:30:19] <devc> asher^: I appreciate the helpful intentions though. It's really great to see people reaching out to help.
[10:30:30] <Whirl3d> monohymn, checking now..
[10:30:38] <devc> Whirl3d: likewise, thanks for taking the time to walk through that logistically with me.
[10:31:10] * Whirl3d instigates group hug
[10:31:27] <asher^> hehe
[10:31:31] <Whirl3d> so, monohym, what is the problem?
[10:31:32] <devc> lol ... Will you marry me? Wait... you ARE a female model, I'm assuming?
[10:31:39] <zivester> I'm writing a variable into an html attribute, whats the correct javascript function to encode the double quotes correctly?
[10:31:41] <karstenk1977_> how can i select an element which hastnÂ´t the specific class? or how can i negate  jQuery().hasClass() ????
[10:32:19] <Whirl3d> zivester, sounds like a non-jquery question to me?
[10:32:44] * zivester goes to #web
[10:33:12] <Whirl3d> karstenk1977_, $("something").not(".someclass");
[10:33:19] <monohymn> Whirl3d: I was wondering if there was a simpler way to code that, with an array and a for loop perhaps? It just seems redundant to use the same code over and over...
[10:33:31] <asher^> jquery is quite fun. i wish front end dev didnt drive me nuts all the time
[10:33:45] <Whirl3d> ?.each  @ monohym
[10:33:45] <bot-t> monohym, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[10:33:57] <Whirl3d> but you don't even need each for that.
[10:34:01] <karstenk1977_> thanks whirl
[10:34:25] <Whirl3d> $(".item").click(showMenu); should work
[10:34:26] <monohymn> okay...
[10:35:06] <Whirl3d> then showMenu=function () {$(this).find("ul").slideToggle("medium");}
[10:35:50] <Whirl3d> monohym, that would say that all .item elements when clicked would slide toggle their children UL elements

[10:41:19] <SkyFlyer> i'm trying an .each loop...  How to I display the index if it's not a 0,1,2,3 but looks like this:   "eng"=>"english","spa"=>"spanish"  .. I need to display the "english" part... similar to key=>value but I need the key?  how to do I get that in the each ?
[10:42:04] <Whirl3d> skyFLyer, you are using .each on a jquery collection, right?
[10:42:19] <ajpiano> SkyFlyer: the first argument is the key, when you use $.each( object , function( key, value ) {});
[10:42:24] <ajpiano> when it's an array, it's the index
[10:42:52] <SkyFlyer> ahh. got it.  yeah. that's correct! thanks
[10:44:35] <karstenk1977_> perhaps someone knew the congruent .not(Class)  forprototype?
[10:46:29] <monohymn> Whirl3d: thanks for the help! I realized the actual menu I was making was a bit more complicated than my example, but it still works. That is slick!

[10:47:42] <monohymn> :D geez, you didn't have to do that!
[10:47:48] <SkyFlyer> is there a way to check if your on the last item in the array?  for the each?
[10:48:27] <Whirl3d> SkyFlyer, $("this").is(":last") ? maybe
[10:49:00] <Whirl3d> *$(this). lol
[10:49:06] <catcher> Hey y'all, can someone please take a look at this selector? Can't seem to get at the node I just appended:   http://jsfiddle.net/G4udt/
[10:50:14] <Whirl3d> $(this).parent().find(".tipText")
[10:50:28] <catcher> Whirl3d, feel like I tried that, but shall try again
[10:51:16] <cafaro> Which is faster; $(foo, bar), or $(bar).find(foo)?
[10:51:19] <catcher> Whirl3d, no error, but no effect
[10:51:29] <ajpiano> cafaro: the latter, marginally
[10:51:39] <cafaro> thought so, thanks :)
[10:51:40] <Whirl3d> $(this).closest(".tipText") assumes that .tipText is an ancestor of $(this). because you are appending it to the parent of $(this), it's a sibling....you might try $(this).sibling(".tipText")
[10:53:00] <catcher> hmm, sibling is not a function, I'm stuck in 1.3.2 - perhaps that was introduced later?
[10:53:15] <ajpiano> it's not sibling, it's siblings()
[10:53:19] <catcher> oh, siblings :)
[10:53:29] <Whirl3d> sorry, typo. thanks ajpiano
[10:55:15] <catcher> Still no go. Hrm.
[10:55:23] <catcher> (no error, no selection)
[10:55:36] <Whirl3d> catcher, is your fadeTo correctly formatted?
[10:56:44] <catcher> Whirl3d, Yes, the fadeTo is all good, which fades my image plus my new text with specified opacity. But then I want the text to be at full opacity rather than the % the image is at.
[10:57:18] <Whirl3d> can you put it in the callback for fadeTo()?
[10:57:50] <Whirl3d> $(this).fadeto(1,1000,function () {$(this).find(".tipText").css("opacity",1)});
[10:58:49] <Whirl3d> ... actually, assign $(this).parent().find(".tipText") to a variable and use it in the callback:
[10:59:03] <catcher> Whirl3d, ah, that's worth a shot..
[10:59:20] <Whirl3d> $("this).fadeTo(1,1000,function () {tip.css("opacity",1)});

[11:15:14] <mightym> well thanks anyway for your help, have a nice evening
[11:15:42] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, i have a series of validation functions that I store in an input element's data object and I need to cycle through them to collect the errors. I thought map would do it, but I need map for an array, not a jquery object...any ideas?
[11:16:10] <ajpiano> $.map( array, function( val, index) { }) ?
[11:17:03] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[11:17:12] <ProLoser|Work> i'm having some problems with deferred and promise
[11:18:17] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: Why don't you explain the problem
[11:19:38] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, i have an array of functions to apply to a single value, would i use $.map(functions, function(val) {return (this(val))?}).get().join()...doesn't seem right
[11:19:38] <ProLoser|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/z4gGB/
[11:19:57] <ProLoser|Work> okay so the thing is i'm working with a special factory that handles lots of deferred events
[11:20:16] <ProLoser|Work> the PROBLEM is that it seems that occasionally, if the page loads slowly, it fails
[11:20:36] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: first you don't need the .get() when you're mapping a regular array
[11:20:36] <guy> how do I detect if item is dragged on another item? is there different method rather than coordinates?
[11:20:53] <ProLoser|Work> jv.Factory.resource() can be called multiple times, from multiple places, at multiple nesting levels, however since it's supposed to be returning references to the originally created deferred i figured this was okay
[11:20:57] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: i probably wouldn't use map for that
[11:21:00] <ProLoser|Work> can anyone take a look at my code?
[11:21:47] <ProLoser|Work> here's a question, i am already storing all my deferreds so that if i call the same resource more than once, i simply pass a reference to the original deferred, should i also be doing this for promise objects?
[11:22:01] <ProLoser|Work> or is it acceptable/necessary to create multiple promise objects each time i try to run a deferred?
[11:22:23] <ProLoser|Work> perhaps i should instead of storing deferreds be storing promise objects?
[11:22:27] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: deferreds can only be resolved once
[11:22:31] <ajpiano> same as promises
[11:22:40] <ProLoser|Work> promises can be resolved?
[11:22:42] <ajpiano> so you can't reuse the old one if you issue a new request, you need a new dfd and promise
[11:22:50] <ajpiano> no
[11:23:00] <ProLoser|Work> okay i don't want to resolve more than 1 time
[11:23:01] <ProLoser|Work> that's my point
[11:23:07] <ProLoser|Work> i want to prevent any and all redundancy
[11:23:18] <ajpiano> right, so you need to create a new deferred and return its promise for every request
[11:23:36] <HeN> hey, is it possible to handle 302 statuscode (redirect) with $.ajax ?
[11:23:37] <ProLoser|Work> i'm trying to memo-ize the deferreds
[11:23:51] <ProLoser|Work> ajpiano: a new deferred?
[11:24:04] <ProLoser|Work> but that would fire the request multiple times
[11:24:06] <ProLoser|Work> i don't want that
[11:24:15] <ProLoser|Work> i'm trying to have any resource load a maximum of one times
[11:24:24] <ajpiano> oh
[11:24:25] <erichynds> HeN: nope
[11:24:34] <ProLoser|Work> if a deferred was already started, i don't want subsequent requests to make a new one, i want them to wait for the first one to finish
[11:24:54] <ProLoser|Work> i am storing deferreds in the private deferreds variable
[11:25:00] <HeN> erichynds: is there anything else I can do?
[11:25:01] <ProLoser|Work> but i'm creating new promise objects each time the request is hit
[11:25:06] <ProLoser|Work> should i be storing the promises instead?
[11:25:08] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: there' is a deferred isResolved methods etc
[11:25:09] <ProLoser|Work> or is this not causing problems?
[11:25:27] <ProLoser|Work> i'm aware
[11:25:27] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: i hate to say this but there comes a point in a man's API when he has to take responsibility for it :/
[11:25:28] <erichynds> HeN: dunno what you're doing. the XHR will follow redirects like any other request
[11:25:37] <ProLoser|Work> but if it's not resolved, i still need it to get executed when it DOES get resolved
[11:25:53] <ProLoser|Work> ajpiano: i don't follow youâ€¦ my api seems fine
[11:25:56] <ajpiano> it's hard to build an intricate thing like this and then expect someone else to be able to look at it for a minute and figure out the problems in the impl
[11:26:02] <ajpiano> yeah, but it's yours
[11:26:04] <ajpiano> you gotta debug it
[11:26:09] <ProLoser|Work> i'm trying
[11:26:13] <ProLoser|Work> i just asked a simple question
[11:26:21] <ProLoser|Work> is creating multiple promise objects off one deferred a problem?
[11:26:23] <HeN> erichynds: cross-domain ajax, I need the html
[11:26:37] <ProLoser|Work> or should i be storing them all and work with 1 promise for each deferred?
[11:26:40] <erichynds> HeN: so what's the problem?
[11:26:43] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: it's not creating multiple promise objects
[11:26:46] <HeN> I'm getting an error
[11:26:53] <ProLoser|Work> return deferred.promise()
[11:26:58] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: the first time you call .promise() it creates the promise, the second... and subsequent times... it returns the existing promise
[11:27:00] <ajpiano> iirc
[11:27:03] <erichynds> HeN: are you aware of the SOP and are you working around it?
[11:27:16] <ProLoser|Work> ah, so as long as i call promise() on the same deferred, it's caching them?
[11:27:23] <ajpiano> yeah
[11:27:29] <ProLoser|Work> okay good
[11:27:54] <HeN> erichynds: what is SOP?
[11:27:57] <ProLoser|Work> is there any problems from calling .when() within .when()?
[11:28:00] <erichynds> ?sop @ HeN
[11:28:01] <bot-t> HeN, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[11:28:11] <ProLoser|Work> like if both whens have 1 item refer to the same event?
[11:28:12] <ajpiano> ProLoser|Work: not that i know of
[11:28:35] <erichynds> HeN: like are you doing cross domain ajax using a proxy, CORS, etc. or are you just expecting $.ajax("google.com") to work?
[11:29:20] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: I think you can all $.when on an array of deferreds
[11:29:32] <Eviltwin> So I don't think you need the .apply
[11:29:39] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: you can't, and you do need the apply
[11:29:46] <Eviltwin> Really?
[11:29:48] <Eviltwin> Won't it eat an object?
[11:29:50] <ajpiano> really
[11:29:59] <erichynds> Eviltwin: that'll treat the array itself as an observable obj
[11:30:05] <erichynds> rather than the promises within
[11:30:06] <ajpiano> its dietary preferences aside, it won't take an array of deferreds
[11:30:23] <ajpiano> it'll take it but do what erichynds sez
[11:30:23] <Eviltwin> That's annoying
[11:30:46] <ProLoser|Work> so my concern is at the top, passing foo() to .when() then inside the callback passing foo() and bar() to a nested when()
[11:30:48] <Eviltwin> Now what about him using .done(deferreds['includes'].resolve)
[11:31:07] <Eviltwin> Is that fact that he's losing the context there a problem?
[11:31:11] <Eviltwin> I don't remember
[11:31:19] <ProLoser|Work> that shouldn't be a problem right? the nested when() will see the foo() is already resolved and simply wait for bar() to resolve
[11:31:27] <ProLoser|Work> or am i being confusing lol
[11:31:36] <MaC_> hey, anyone have time to create a quick function for me? I'll pay for it via paypal
[11:31:57] <ProLoser|Work> when(foo) { when(foo, bar) { // yay } }
[11:32:32] <ProLoser|Work> i'm assuming that ^ is safe since the nested item is simply working with 1 already resolved promise and an unresolved promise
[11:33:08] <Eviltwin> Kinda silly but yeah, it should be fine
[11:33:42] <ProLoser|Work> i know it's silly, but my teammates are morons and the code is riddled with nesting and dependencies
[11:33:55] <ProLoser|Work> so this is my solution to sort ofâ€¦ sort all that out in an elegant manner
[11:34:29] <Eviltwin> I'm not really sure how "when(foo) { when(foo, bar) { // yay } }" sorts anything out better than when(foo) { when(bar) { // yay } }
[11:34:51] <ProLoser|Work> this way 'modules' or bundles of code can list out their own specific dependencies regardless of how or when the module was called or what dependencies were issued before it
[11:35:02] <ProLoser|Work> it's an attempt at modularity with room for nesting
[11:35:30] <ProLoser|Work> because it's like [MODULE A] when(foo) { MODULE B() }
[11:35:39] <ProLoser|Work> [MODULE B] when (foo, bar)
[11:35:51] <ProLoser|Work> *[MODULE B ]
[11:36:28] <ProLoser|Work> iunno, I felt it was a good solution :/
[11:36:47] <ProLoser|Work> they didn't want to organize their code into something more structured like backbone or spine
[11:39:03] <Pessimism> when I can write `var $this = $(this); var my_id = this.id;`, can I also use `this.text;` to store the text()?
[11:40:08] <erichynds> this.id yes, this.text no
[11:40:22] <bakers> If I wrap a jquery object in another jquery query does that break anything? var foo = $(":first"); var bar = $(foo);
[11:40:31] <MaC_> var $cat = jQuery('.galleria-image-inline').width(); if($cat < 450){ jQuery('img.galleria-image-inline').css('margin-left', '150px');}
[11:40:47] <MaC_> that only works on the first element, any help on making it apply to all elements on a document?
[11:40:50] <ProLoser|Work> bakers: that's like dividing by 0
[11:42:07] <bakers> ProLoser|Work: If I do it, I get back the same jquery object. just making sure that's normal
[11:42:18] <ProLoser|Work> i'm joking iunno
[11:42:20] <Pessimism> erichynds: id is just a shorthand, then? I guess `this.text();` would be the way to go, then.
[11:42:26] <erichynds> MaC_: look through the collection
[11:42:40] <jklmnop> bakers: you can pass jq a jq object. it should be the same unless you add to the stack
[11:42:43] <erichynds> Pessimism: yap, $(this).text() though.
[11:42:50] <MaC_> erichynds: ?
[11:42:57] <erichynds> MaC_: loop, sorry
[11:43:19] <Pessimism> erichynds: I meant after `var $this = $(this);`
[11:43:27] <bakers> I want to write a function that takes a selector. With that I can make the function argument either a selector, or a jquery object
[11:43:36] <MaC_> erichynds: I'm not sure the query syntax
[11:44:19] <ajpiano> bakers: function( foo ) { foo = foo.jquery ? foo : $(foo); } or something like that
[11:45:18] <webadpro> Hey all
[11:45:27] <webadpro> Anyone has used jeditable in the past?
[11:45:31] <webadpro> Is there any better ones?
[11:45:47] <bakers> ajpiano: I was just gonna do function foobar(selector) { var myobj = $(selector); }
[11:46:06] <bakers> ajpiano: If selector is already a jquery object no harm no foul
[11:46:16] <jklmnop> bakers: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#cloning-jquery-objects
[11:46:39] <ajpiano> bakers: so then why even bother asking :p
[11:47:03] <jklmnop> bakers: that's what happens when you pass a jq object to jq
[11:47:05] <bakers> ajpiano: I'm asking which is a better method...
[11:47:18] <bakers> ajpiano: Your method just saves that one last call to jquery constructor?
[11:47:19] <webadpro> anyone in here has used any type of inline editing?
[11:47:55] <ajpiano> bakers: if, as jklmnop just pointed out, you don't want to actually create a new jquery object if it's already a jquery object... then you might want to use mine
[11:48:17] <bakers> ajpiano: Ok that makes sense
[11:48:36] <bakers> Cool
[11:48:50] <MaC_> Anyone have an idae how I run a function on all elements that match the selector?
[11:49:02] <khmer_> ajpiano: but doesn't the constructor just return itself if it can tell there's already a jquery object?
[11:49:06] <jklmnop> MaC_ .each
[11:49:32] <mjmc> What do people use for full page blocking these days? BlockUI looks cool but was wondering if there was something newer / better. Thanks!
[11:49:42] <bakers> mjmc: I use blockUI
[11:50:04] <mjmc> bakers: thx
[11:50:21] <ajpiano> alright #jquery it's been fun as always, i'm gonna do some work
[11:50:41] <jklmnop> mjmc: my guess is if you block everything, you don't have to account for people clicking behind the modal you're showing. that may cause unwanted errors
[11:52:07] <HeN> erichynds: seems like I'm getting the right address only when I set the dataType to 'jsonp'
[11:52:12] <MaC_> will the each function collect all matches or do I have to collect them in to an object or array?
[11:52:31] <erichynds> HeN: yup.
[11:52:42] <HeN> but then I get a syntax error
[11:53:38] <jklmnop> MaC_: $(selector).each(function(i, el){ //do something here. el is a dom obj, i is the index in the collection});
[11:54:23] <MaC_> jklmnop: thanks
[11:54:48] <jklmnop> MaC_: np
[11:55:52] <HeN> erichynds: parse error :|
[11:56:20] <Sil4nc4_> hi, if i use toggle to hide and show somehting  i can only make it show, the second i click it, it does nothing? any idea?
[11:57:11] <bakers> Sil4nc4_: I don't understand what your asking
[11:58:25] <Pessimism> Me neither
[11:58:33] <Sil4nc4_> nv bakers, i used toggle the wrong way to show and hide some divs while clicking on a link
[11:58:45] <Pessimism> kk :)
[12:05:36] <tomasm-> hi, is there a jquery plugin that makes it easy to transpose images on top of each other in a layered fashion, with coordinate offsets, etc? something as simple as $('#container').loadImage(src, x,y, w,h)
[12:12:21] <`WarpKat> tomasm-, this might give you an idea or two - http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable
[12:12:28] <Dave_Stein> ?trigger @ thegreatsecond
[12:12:28] <bot-t> thegreatsecond, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[12:12:49] <tomasm-> `WarpKat, nothing draggable, just multiple layers.... probably will code something myself.
[12:13:32] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: when you wanna chat about that branch?
[12:13:51] <`WarpKat> it would most likely be z-index of the image and then modifying the coordinates
[12:14:27] <Tobsn> is there a way to select in reverse?
[12:14:35] <Tobsn> instead of traversing downwards, find first element upwards?
[12:14:55] <Tobsn> $('.class',this).reversefind() ;)
[12:14:57] <`WarpKat> tomasm-, i do the same kind of thing you're talking about, but with PHP's gd functions.  i place little dots on a map... :)
[12:15:10] <asher^> is there a simple way to use jquery to submit a form with ajax without me having to specify each input?
[12:16:20] <Tobsn> asher^, from.serialize()
[12:16:36] <asher^> thanks ill look that up
[12:16:37] <Tobsn> data:$('#form').serialize()
[12:16:41] <tomasm-> `WarpKat, yeah do the thing with GD right now, just that the page has a form where they can change options/customization of the image, and i think using ajax and layering parts to the image would be faster than having php/gd re-render the whole thing
[12:17:17] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: sometime later tonight
[12:17:30] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: just came on to make fun of coworker with bot cause he doesn't go on IRC and was asking me silly API questions
[12:17:32] <Dave_Stein> rtm!
[12:17:49] <aglemann> hey, there's .serialize() to convert a form to a querystring, and .serializeArray to convert a form to an array of name=value pairs.. but if there a way to just convert a form to a plain old object?
[12:17:54] <asher^> tyvm Tobsn
[12:18:00] <Tobsn> ;)
[12:18:17] <ShaunR> What do you guys do for modal/blocking and displaying forms for user input and dialogs.  I've used jquery-ui but i'm not all that happy with it, it's great for dialogs but not for much else.  Looking at using blockui maybe
[12:18:56] <tomasm-> ShaunR, there's also simple modal, i think
[12:18:58] <Tobsn> aglemann, serialize()
[12:19:14] * gnarf frowns, feelings hurt
[12:19:17] <Tobsn> var f = $('#form').serialize(); f.inputname;
[12:19:18] <Hopsy> hey jquery people can you help me?
[12:19:24] <gnarf> ?ask @Hopsy
[12:19:25] <bot-t> Hopsy, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:19:39] <Hopsy> someone asked this in the medicine channel
[12:19:40] <Hopsy> [21:17:30] <bluesdoc> professor Hopsy, what are some striking anatomical difference between an ape brain and a human brain?
[12:19:47] <tomasm-> ShaunR, there's also qtip, which i use for smaller contextual tooltips/info boxes
[12:19:49] <chovy> Does anyone know how to inspect data-foo attributes in Firebug?
[12:19:51] <Hopsy> [21:17:38] <bluesdoc> differences*
[12:19:51] <gnarf> off topic :)
[12:19:56] <Hopsy> ow :(
[12:19:56] <Hopsy> okay
[12:20:01] <bsod2> quite offoptic
[12:20:10] <gnarf> ?slap Hopsy
[12:20:10] * bot-t slaps Hopsy around a bit with a large trout
[12:20:13] <bsod2> hehe
[12:20:18] <tomasm-> Hopsy, depends on the person
[12:20:20] <Hopsy> whhyyy
[12:20:28] <Hopsy> ok, wait I will tell that lol
[12:20:53] <bsod2> the answer to the question is obviously that we have bigger frontal lobes but ok
[12:21:01] <gnarf> chovy: what do you mean?
[12:21:12] <tomasm-> Hopsy, for example, an ape probably wouldn't ask questions in such an off-topic way
[12:21:25] <aglemann> Tobsn: var f = $('irc://asimov.freenode.net/#form').serialize(); // "inputname=community%2Finclude%2Fproduct"
[12:21:29] <Tekhne> hi, i'm having problems in a legacy app using jquery 1.3.2. when i call .toggle() on an element from within the "success" callback of a $.post() call, that element doesn't always show in IE7 if it was previously hidden. is this a known bug with jquery or maybe IE7?
[12:21:30] <chovy> gnarf: i'm using $("div").data('foo', 'Foo'); i want to see that value in Firebug.
[12:21:44] <gnarf> ?serializeArray
[12:21:45] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[12:21:46] <aglemann> Tobsn: serialize returns a querystring, not an object
[12:21:52] <Tobsn> hmm
[12:21:54] <stalecache> Google may be getting a lot of IE8 users to upgrade very soon ;)... currently they're breaking websites where... User is on IE8, user is logged into Gmail, Google +1 widget exists
[12:21:59] <Tobsn> i thought it returns an object
[12:22:05] <Hopsy> Tekhne: that means everyone here is an ape except me?
[12:22:06] <gnarf> chovy: thats not a data-* attr anymore
[12:22:11] <gnarf> thats jQuery data cache
[12:22:12] <Hopsy> I am an alien
[12:22:14] <chovy> gnarf: what do you mean?
[12:22:18] <Tobsn> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1184624/serialize-form-to-json-with-jquery
[12:22:21] <Tobsn> use google
[12:22:33] <gnarf> chovy: .data() is not data attrs, it will get initial values from the attributes
[12:22:43] <gnarf> but thats it
[12:22:45] <gnarf> anyway
[12:22:47] <chovy> gnarf: http://api.jquery.com/data/
[12:22:49] <gnarf> ?g firequery
[12:22:50] <bot-t> gnarf, FireQuery is a Firebug extension for jQuery development - http://firequery.binaryage.com/
[12:22:55] <chovy> i don't think so.
[12:23:08] <asher^> im looking to do one of those effects where the page gets darkened/blurred and a popup like div appears in the foreground. does anyone know what function i should be looking for?
[12:23:27] <`WarpKat> you mean a dialog?
[12:23:28] <Tobsn> erm how do i prepend but skip the first child?
[12:23:34] <`WarpKat> asher^, a dialog box?
[12:23:34] <aglemann> tks Tobsn .. that's what i was thinking i'd need to do.. just wasn't sure if there was an existing way
[12:23:58] <gnarf> chovy: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/d5f144a7bba98212d6fe9e257f722b62baf651f0 i do think so
[12:23:58] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery by timmywil (1m, 6d ago): Landing pull request 500. 1.7 - "public data" stored as a key on "internal data" - Fixes #8921.More Details: - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/500 - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8921
[12:24:01] <gnarf> and i helped write it
[12:24:03] <gnarf> so like
[12:24:10] <gnarf> trust me
[12:24:12] <asher^> not a dialog like an alert(), more like when you are submitting a form and waiting for it to process, i want the regular page to go dark and a white div with the  progress appear in the foreground
[12:24:18] <gnarf> .data() only gets initial values from the data-* attribute
[12:24:22] <`WarpKat> ahh
[12:24:33] <gnarf> if you use it as a setter it DOES NOT set the data-* attribute
[12:24:37] <gnarf> it uses the jQuery data cache
[12:24:44] <gnarf> and firequery lets you look at that i believe
[12:24:47] <gnarf> in chrome console
[12:24:55] <gnarf> if you have an element inspected you can $($0).data()
[12:25:13] <gnarf> i personally use chrome
[12:25:28] <gnarf> so im not positive if there is something like $0 in firebug, or if that even works
[12:26:44] <chovy> why would you change .data() to not be data attributes?
[12:26:55] <Tobsn> if i have a ul/li and i want to insert another li after the first li - anyone an idea?
[12:27:31] <gnarf> Tobsn: depends on what you already have for the ul / li
[12:27:33] <gnarf> but like
[12:27:40] <gnarf> newLi.after( firstLi )
[12:27:43] <DukeDrake> hm .. the "isLocal" option with ajax sounds kind of awesome ... yet I don't really understand yet what it's for?
[12:27:46] <gnarf> ?after
[12:27:47] <bot-t> .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[12:27:55] <gnarf> oops
[12:27:56] <Tobsn> <ul><li></li>HERE<li></li><li></li></ul>
[12:28:11] <Tobsn> hmm yeah after might do it
[12:28:11] <gnarf> firstLi.after( newcontent )
[12:28:17] <gnarf> ?insertAfter
[12:28:17] <bot-t> .insertAfter(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements after the target. http://api.jquery.com/insertAfter/
[12:28:20] <Tobsn> but how do i select the first li?
[12:28:35] <gnarf> ul.find("li").first() ?
[12:28:44] <Tobsn> hmm
[12:28:45] <Tobsn> k
[12:28:49] <Tobsn> or :first-child?
[12:28:51] <devc> $('ul li:first') ?
[12:28:59] <gnarf> ul.find("li:nth-child(0)")
[12:29:08] <gnarf> ?nth-child
[12:29:08] <bot-t> :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[12:29:18] <gnarf> ?first selector
[12:29:19] <bot-t> gnarf, :first Selector - http://api.jquery.com/first-selector/
[12:29:32] <Tobsn> ah okay
[12:29:35] <Tobsn> first().after() worked
[12:29:38] <Tobsn> thanks :)
[12:29:43] <Tobsn> now it looks fucking odd
[12:29:55] <Tobsn> _('ul.uiList li',(_(tthis).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent())).first().after('<li
[12:29:56] <DukeDrake> anyone got me a hint on what to use ajax isLocal for?
[12:30:04] <Tobsn> i wish there was a referse find()
[12:30:07] <gnarf> Tobsn: woahhhhhhh .parent()
[12:30:10] <gnarf> ?closest @Tobsn
[12:30:10] <Tobsn> yeah...
[12:30:10] <bot-t> Tobsn, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[12:30:12] <mapper99> I am using a tab slide out on the left of my page,  Now, I need the div beside the tab to move/resize if the tab is opened or closed.  Is there any way to do this?
[12:30:17] <Tobsn> OH!
[12:30:19] <Tobsn> fuck yeah.
[12:30:20] <Tobsn> thanks
[12:31:02] <chovy> gnarf: if .data no longer supports html5 data attributes, how should we set data attributes then?
[12:31:04] <jklmnop> Tobsn: if you need all parents until a certain point ?parentsUntil
[12:31:17] <gnarf> chovy: wow man
[12:31:25] <gnarf> chovy: it never supported setting data-* attributes
[12:31:26] <gnarf> ever
[12:31:36] <jklmnop> ?parentsUntil @Tobsn
[12:31:36] <bot-t> Tobsn, .parentsUntil([selector], [filter]): Get the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/parentsUntil/
[12:31:39] <gnarf> why do you need to set the data-* attributes?
[12:31:42] <Tobsn> $(tthis).closest('ul.uiList li').first().after('<li - that doesnt work
[12:31:57] <gnarf> jQuery has an internal data cache which can store more than just strings
[12:32:04] <chovy> As of jQuery 1.4.3 HTML 5 data- attributes will be automatically pulled in to jQuery's data object.
[12:32:21] <jklmnop> Tobsn: tthis? typo?
[12:32:28] <gnarf> chovy: correct - .data() gets its initial value from a data- attribute on the node
[12:32:30] <Tobsn> nah its within a ajax
[12:32:38] <mapper99> Here is the code for my slider- http://jsfiddle.net/3CEUh/
[12:32:39] <chovy> so you're saying it reads data attributes, but doesn't write them back out, and instead uses some internal data object w/in jQuery
[12:32:39] <Tobsn> var tthis = _(this);
[12:32:40] <Tobsn> ah
[12:32:48] <gnarf> chovy: correct
[12:32:51] <chovy> ok
[12:32:58] <gnarf> chovy: .data() returns that object
[12:33:00] <Whirl3d> anybody got a better plugin than jcaret for determining the position of the cursor inside an input element? (example pos:0 would be at the beginning and pos:3 would be three characters in..not x,y coord)
[12:33:16] <gnarf> chovy: and i think firequery lets you see it in the inspector
[12:33:18] <chovy> i can still set/get them the same way, it's just not a data attribute.
[12:33:29] <gnarf> chovy: correct, its on the jQuery data cache
[12:34:05] <chovy> gnarf: thanks.
[12:34:08] <akavlie> Is it possible to find out what events are active for a given selector?
[12:34:11] <chovy> didn't know about firequery. checking it now.
[12:34:14] <akavlie> or plugins?
[12:34:54] <gnarf> chovy: no problem, glad you finially listened ;)
[12:35:12] <Tobsn> yeah closest() runs too far
[12:35:19] <Tobsn> its selecting a parent way ahead
[12:35:36] <Tobsn> what i need is to go up 4-5 levels and then select downwards
[12:35:56] <chovy> gnarf: I didn't know it was read only.
[12:36:08] <chovy> thanks for clearing it up.
[12:36:31] <mapper99> Here is the updated code for my slider- http://jsfiddle.net/3CEUh/1/  Is there a resize method I can use to do this?
[12:36:56] <sgrover> help?  IE8 specific problem.  Doing  lsd = $('<div id="mydiv"></div>');  fails.  Complains that object doesn't support the property or method...
[12:37:43] <chovy> Tobsn: $("foo").parents("bar").find(".something_in_bar");
[12:38:30] <Tobsn> hmm
[12:39:00] <Tobsn> im trying _('ul.uiList li', tthis.parentsUntil('form')).first().after()
[12:39:02] <Tobsn> gonna see if that works
[12:39:49] <Tobsn> meh, of course it doesnt
[12:40:36] <Tobsn> chovy, yours works, thanks :)
[12:43:35] <chovy> Tobsn: np :)
[12:46:30] <sgrover> k, even more fun.  I replaced my code with  lsd = document.createElement('div');  and IE8 still complains the object doesn't support the property/method...   So it seems IE8 is reporting the wrong line (no surprise!)
[12:47:13] <mapper99> I am using a tab slide out on the left of my page.  All my content gets covered up when the tab slides out.  How can I get the content to move over?  http://jsfiddle.net/3CEUh/1/
[12:48:03] <stalecache> sgrover, are you logged into gmail while testing in IE8?
[12:48:12] <sgrover> nope.
[12:48:39] <sgrover> odd though - I just proved it IS that particular line...  (dumping values before and after the line - don't see the ones after...)
[12:49:01] <stalecache> ha, ok... well currently the google plus widget AND being logged into gmail/google is causing some javascript weirdnesss
[12:49:24] <stalecache> ... IE 8 only
[12:54:57] <jklmnop> sgrover: i just tried both $('<div id="test"></div>') and $('<div id="test" />') in IE8 and i got no error
[12:55:42] <sgrover> lsd was being used in a loop and wasn't previously defined.  Added a var lsd; to the top of the function and got past that particular error.  I hate IE!!!
[12:55:48] <jeffsmykil> anyone know if there is a channel dedicated to canvas?
[12:56:07] <sgrover> jeffsmykil: #html5 is the best I've found
[12:56:15] <jeffsmykil> thanks sgrover
[12:56:16] <snover> sgrover: you hate IE because you had a coding error and it forced you to fix it?
[12:56:37] <jeffsmykil> i hate anyone anything that tells me i have a coding error
[12:57:08] <sgrover> snover: no, I hate IE because it demands wasted time "fixing" code that works perfectly fine in every other browser.
[12:57:43] <sgrover> But point taken - my error in the code caused this particular instance....
[12:57:57] <snover> code that is dumping shit into global because you are not careful with your variable declarations is not really working perfectly fine :)
[12:58:20] <mightym> hey guys, newbee question â€¦ i add a element on click to the dom. afterwards i have to add a on click event on that element. how should i do this?  it seems that adding the click event on the element after it was created in the first click function isn't working ...
[12:58:31] <ryanneufeld> snover++
[12:58:45] <jklmnop> sgrover: you really should declare your vars. http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html#variable%20declarations
[12:59:08] <sgrover> jklmnop: yes.  I know... but thanks.
[12:59:37] <sgrover> I normally do - this one was missed.
[12:59:40] <ryanneufeld> sgrover: sounds like IE forced you to write better code? (I just got here)
[13:00:47] <sgrover> ryanneufeld: in this one case, yes.  I've had to devolve code in other instances though....  (like not using "key" as a variable name cuz IE8 demands it be a reserved word...)
[13:01:46] <jklmnop> sgrover: just make it a string if you REALLY need to use it (e.g.: { 'key' : 'value' } )
[13:02:20] <sgrover> jklmnop: that doesn't work when you are doing for(key in myObject) ....
[13:03:48] <sgrover> anyone else seeing a large performance difference between IE8 and a more modern browser?  I'm talking seconds differences in processing times...
[13:04:12] <sgrover> (enough seconds that it is noticeable and the customer is complaining...)
[13:04:15] <ryanneufeld> sgrover: I don't see it here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ttyab5c8.aspx
[13:04:28] <gnarf> sgrover: jsperf.com
[13:04:45] <sgrover> gnarf: thanks.
[13:04:59] <zoned> anyone in here know anything about css frameworks? i've tried posing this question in #css.. but it's full of trolls: i've never used a css framework (though i've been doing some extensive reading on blueprint and 960). just looking for some expert opionions, pros/cons, etc. read a bunch of blog posts, i don't really think i've been persuaded one side or the other, and i'd love to hear some specifics/expert opionions from rea
[13:04:59] <zoned> l developers.
[13:05:09] <sgrover> ryanneufeld: dunno what to say.  Changing my for/in loops to use "p" instead of "key" solved the problem...
[13:05:23] <jklmnop> sgrover why not just use k?
[13:05:24] <raygerrard> iv used blueprint extensively and would recommend
[13:05:25] <jklmnop> haha
[13:05:37] <bytecraft> http://jsfiddle.net/wTxYw/4/ - how can I set a timer to the slide - in ?
[13:05:42] <bytecraft> can someone provide me some documentation as well
[13:05:50] <sgrover> Hmm... maybe I didn't properly set the scope of "key" and it was getting confused...
[13:05:56] <sgrover> jklmnop: that's just semantics.
[13:06:44] <ryanneufeld> sgrover: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0779sbks(v=VS.94).aspx
[13:06:54] <jklmnop> sgrover: it's just funny that you're mad you couldn't use "key" so you choose "p" over "k". the important thing is that you solved your problem and saved some chars while you're at it
[13:07:12] <ryanneufeld> jklmnop: but his assumption of why is false
[13:07:41] <zoned> raygerrard, can you tell me why?
[13:07:46] <gnarf> var prop in obj
[13:08:40] <sgrover> ryanneufeld: yes.  Just proved that - key is being used elsewhere.  wasn't scoped via var.
[13:08:59] <ryanneufeld> oh, wait, so it wasn't IE again?
[13:09:13] <bytecraft> How do you set a function to activate after an alloted amount of time, instead of say a click
[13:09:13] <ryanneufeld> That's two for two since I started paying attention :P
[13:09:22] <sgrover> btw, thanks all for the patience.  I admit I perhaps vented at IE unjustly in this case.
[13:09:44] <sgrover> bytecraft: setTimeout()
[13:09:58] <bytecraft> window.setInterval(yourfunction, 10000); ?
[13:10:01] <jklmnop> sgrover: it's not easy to side with IEâ€¦ :)

[13:29:55] <mapper99> <ryanneufeld>  The slider works great, but the div does not resize.  It just gets pushed to the left - http://jsfiddle.net/3CEUh/7/
[13:30:02] <w_paul> i know how to call it, but the context is wrong
[13:30:21] <w_paul> so i guess i need to bind it to $(this) somehow?

[13:33:38] <ryanneufeld> ?eval 6/2*(1+2) @Aamir
[13:33:38] <bot-t> Aamir: 9
[13:33:42] <mapper99> <ryanneufeld> of course!  I missed that.  One goofy thing though is that I now get a horizontal scrollbar when the div resizes.
[13:33:55] <ryanneufeld> that could be your margin
[13:34:07] <Aamir> ryanneufeld:  http://gyazo.com/5f9846d454e7964089c5602fcd1f11d2
[13:34:40] <xp_prg> google is not being very helpful, does anyone use any other search engines?
[13:34:56] <ryanneufeld> mapper99: yeah, t's cause the width isn't taking into account the margin you have on it

[13:38:50] <xp_prg> jqp but what if you just did: var r = stringvar.match(/^hi$/);
[13:39:03] <xp_prg> can you just do if(r) { to know if there was a match?
[13:39:35] <xp_prg> it appears that is true :>
[13:40:13] <jqp> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match suggests using the 'test' method in your case, i think
[13:40:28] <mapper99> <ryanneufeld> Thanks for your help.  I have one more question - Once I override CSS using jquery, how do I get jquery to respect the original css again.  If I resize my page after the tab has shifted out, I get horizontal scrollbars again and the div does not honor the width 100% css
[13:40:50] <ryanneufeld> mapper99: you have to either store the previous value
[13:41:13] <xp_prg> hmm.. ok thanks
[13:41:23] <ryanneufeld> mapper99: or apply it with a css calss
[13:41:32] <ryanneufeld> mapper99: and do addClass/removeClass

[14:26:21] <jklmnop> USvER: but what do you mean by "it blocks." describe how it's blocking. is it that the page freezes or that they're in the way visually?
[14:26:49] <USvER> jklmnop page freez for seconds
[14:27:01] <USvER> not exeptible
[14:27:03] <jklmnop> USvER: you're making 100 buttons. i think i found your problem
[14:27:09] <gnarf> heh
[14:27:33] <USvER> jklmnop i tryed to make load by 10 still not exaprible
[14:27:46] <xp_prg> I have jQuery UI 1.8, will the smoothness them from jQuery 1.8.16 work with it?
[14:28:38] <USvER> jklmnop: When i load by 10 i have page freeze for 10 times which is even more annoying
[14:29:35] <xp_prg> hello?
[14:29:37] <jklmnop> USvER basically you're making a lot of buttons in one shot. it's going to take a while to create them all.
[14:29:38] <USvER> jklmnop i guess if i will load by 1 item i will get all 100 freezes of page
[14:30:10] <USvER> jklmnop i don't want my page to lagg like hell
[14:30:21] <jklmnop> USvER: don't install your plugin
[14:30:33] <USvER> jklmnop not funny
[14:30:37] <gnarf> yeah, it was
[14:30:48] <jklmnop> USvER: unfortunately that's your problem.
[14:31:00] <USvER> jklmnop nope it's not
[14:31:06] <jklmnop> USvER: okay
[14:32:02] <xp_prg> how do I get the themes for just jquery 1.8?
[14:32:09] <USvER> ok so why you even talk when you talking shit?
[14:32:40] <ajpiano> xp_prg: ??
[14:32:52] <ajpiano> jquery ui... 1.8 ?
[14:32:58] <xp_prg> well I am using jquery ui 1.8 ya
[14:33:10] <ajpiano> right....
[14:33:24] <xp_prg> I want to get the smoothness them for it cuz I am afraid the 1.8.16 theme would not work with it
[14:33:25] <jklmnop> USvER: i tried to help. you refuse to accept my recommendation. others have agreed with me. what else can i do? you seem absolutely sure that isn't the problem.
[14:33:26] <ajpiano> what do you want...your theme comes with your development bundle
[14:34:05] <USvER> jklmnop your recomendation was to not write plugin at all, ofc it's not exaptible
[14:34:11] <xp_prg> I don't think I have it and I didn't set this up before, can I get it independently somehow?
[14:34:44] <ajpiano> xp_prg: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.16/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css
[14:34:54] <jklmnop> USvER: i said don't install it if it's causing your page to lagâ€¦ because you're making 100 buttons
[14:35:02] <USvER> jklmnop and when .buttonset() blocks my UI even on small amount of buttons then it's definately not problem of my plugin
[14:35:05] <xp_prg> ajpiano but that is for 1.8.16, I only have 1.8
[14:35:27] <USvER> jklmnop i said that loading by 10 freezes 10 times
[14:35:39] <ajpiano> xp_prg: maybe don't use buttonset?
[14:35:40] <USvER> jklmnop so even 10 is a problem
[14:35:50] <jklmnop> USvER: okay. then i'm stumped. and you should submit a ticket to the UI ticket tracker if you're sure that it's a UI problem
[14:36:07] <ajpiano> whoopos
[14:36:12] <ajpiano> USvER: so maybe don't use buttonset?
[14:36:20] <ajpiano> if you have so much to enhance
[14:36:32] <ajpiano> creating tons of proxy elements is gonna be a dog for perf no matter how you slice it
[14:36:55] <ajpiano> xp_prg: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.0/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css
[14:36:56] <USvER> jklmnop I asked help on #jquery ? Or i missed?
[14:37:13] <xp_prg> thanks ajpiano, I heart you
[14:37:37] <ajpiano> xp_prg: all the theme links for every version are linked on the release blog post and on the cdn
[14:37:53] <ajpiano> xp_prg: also why would you just stay with 1.8 instead of upgrading somewhere along the line
[14:38:27] <jklmnop> @USvER i did try to help. i gave you advice and you don't seem to understand that making 100 buttons with buttonset will cause lag. either have less buttons or don't use buttonset. that's what it comes down to.
[14:38:51] <xp_prg> hmm... ok, good to know, my other dumb question is how do I know what was packaged in a jquery-ui-1.8.min.js
[14:39:09] <xp_prg> ajpiano, I don't want to break existing implementations
[14:39:14] <NewtonianB> I have some jquery that adds and delete data on the page but after it does that the scroll bar moves, how can I prevent the scroll bar from moving?
[14:39:40] <ajpiano> xp_prg: 1.8.x is just stability and bug fix releases on top of 1.8
[14:40:08] <xp_prg> so it won't break anything?
[14:40:13] <ajpiano> it shouldn't
[14:40:25] <USvER> jklmnop it's like when dude comes to shrink and say that he want to die... and doctor say: "either go fuck yoursef or suicide"
[14:41:21] <ajpiano> USvER: if you have hundreds of radio buttons
[14:41:28] <ajpiano> surely you understand that creating hundreds and hundred of elements
[14:41:31] <ajpiano> to replace them
[14:41:36] <ajpiano> is going to be an expensive thing
[14:41:48] <ajpiano> regardless of whether you're using the UI button or anything else that themes native controls
[14:42:14] <jklmnop> USvER: how does that make you feel?
[14:42:18] <ajpiano> so you should drop the attitude and think about how you might want to approach the problem given those constraints
[14:42:30] <ajpiano> i'm gonna shower!
[14:42:42] <USvER> jklmnop When there is nead in 100 buttons... than there is nead...
[14:43:19] <jklmnop> USvER: then you will take a performance hit. it's as simple as that. it's give and take.
[14:43:43] <ajpiano> USvER: i had a similar situation once with a custom ui widget where it was replacing a multiselect
[14:43:48] <ajpiano> it worked fine with small elments
[14:43:54] <ajpiano> but i had this multiselect with like 3000 options
[14:44:07] <USvER> jklmnop i think it can be done more efficient
[14:44:10] <ajpiano> i ended up giving up the solution that created proxy elements
[14:44:21] <ajpiano> it because it sucks for perf
[14:44:22] <USvER> jklmnop and i thin there is a solution for UI block!
[14:44:31] <ajpiano> USvER: are you listening to the words that i am saying
[14:44:43] <USvER> y
[14:45:17] <ajpiano> can you see why it might be better to just leave the native controls? what is so bad about them?
[14:45:20] <USvER> but 100 it's not 3000
[14:45:23] <jklmnop> ajpiano: i think you should probably just get that shower
[14:45:29] <ajpiano> jklmnop: yeah i think you're right
[14:45:33] <USvER> 10 is not 3000
[14:45:38] <ajpiano> USvER: good luck in this and all future endeavours
[14:45:53] <USvER> oh ty
[14:45:58] <jklmnop> USvER: i don't think we have the solution you're looking for. if you figure it out, please share it. but i'm done here too
[14:45:59] <USvER> you both was so nice
[14:46:50] <USvER> have a good day
[14:47:00] <jklmnop> USvER: you too. good luck
[14:47:03] <johnywp> hey all
[14:47:11] <johnywp> do you see any problems with this code? http://jsfiddle.net/ssPkH/2/
[14:48:42] <NewtonianB> I have some jquery that adds and delete data on the page but after it does that the scroll bar moves, how can I prevent the scroll bar from moving?
[14:52:06] <jklmnop> johnywp: are you referring to the });//]]> ?
[14:53:21] <jklmnop> @johnywp if so, remove the script tags for the js in jsfiddle
[14:55:58] <ryanneufeld> johnywp: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/ssPkH/4/
[15:06:14] <johnywp> sorry for the delay - i didn't notice that anyone replied.
[15:06:54] <johnywp> jklmnop: no - I am reffering to the fact that the script doesn't seem to submit the data.
[15:07:15] <johnywp> ryanneufeld: i cannot, for the life of me, figure out what you changed :P any tips?
[15:08:31] <jklmnop> johnywp: he removed the script tags (as i suggested). we didn't know what you wanted us to look for because you didn't tell us
[15:08:53] <johnywp> ohhh sorry :P
[15:08:58] <johnywp> basically
[15:09:20] <johnywp> what I am trying to do is get the form to pass the inputs to the page (which is also where the proccessing happens)
[15:09:32] <ryanneufeld> johnywp: I took out the script tags
[15:09:38] <johnywp> and while loading, I want it to display the loading gif
[15:09:41] <ryanneufeld> as jklmnop pointed out
[15:09:46] <jklmnop> johnywp any reason you're not using .serialize()?
[15:09:47] <johnywp> yeap :P
[15:10:02] <johnywp> no particular reason - just that I am not very familiar with it
[15:10:36] <jklmnop> if you $(form).serialize() it will turn it into  one=1&two=2 etc
[15:10:54] <johnywp> basically, in the same page as the form
[15:11:09] <LakWork> why does google default to jqueryui.it for all jqueryui searches...
[15:11:10] <LakWork> wtf
[15:11:11] <johnywp> i have a php proccess which outputs a result based on the inputs
[15:11:27] <johnywp> the process has to use the inputs to request the output from an API
[15:11:30] <johnywp> and that takes too long
[15:11:42] <johnywp> so I want to display a loading gif during the loading time
[15:11:58] <jklmnop> well, you can show the loading with beforeSend
[15:11:59] <johnywp> am i approaching it the right way? cause nothing seems to happen
[15:12:34] <johnywp> would i still keep action="" in the form?
[15:13:46] <jklmnop> yeah, but you don't have to fill it out
[15:13:56] <johnywp> ok
[15:14:20] <johnywp> in that case, everytime the form gets submitted, the page will reload and it will not render until the output is generated
[15:14:28] <johnywp> is there any way to stop that?
[15:14:47] <johnywp> as in - have it reload only when the output is ready to be rendered?
[15:15:26] <jklmnop> johnywp: http://jsfiddle.net/ssPkH/8/
[15:15:31] <jklmnop> i dunno, something like that
[15:15:51] <johnywp> hmmm
[15:15:52] <andrew12> is there a way to completely remove a css property?
[15:16:00] <jklmnop> johnywp so you don't want to reload the page, preventDefault on the event
[15:16:25] <jklmnop> johnywp: use beforeSend to get the image to show up after submit (it doesn't happen because you're not actually calling anything here)
[15:16:38] <jklmnop> johnywp and put whatever you want to have happen in your complete
[15:16:50] <johnywp> and then if I use $example = $_POST['tax'] in the process php, in order to use that value in the code, would serialize work?
[15:17:32] <jklmnop> johnywp: if your form is a POST formâ€¦ yes. they get send over just like GET varsâ€¦ just not through the url
[15:18:25] <jklmnop> johnywp send the ajax with type: 'post' as another part of the config
[15:18:33] <johnywp> ok
[15:18:52] <jklmnop> johnywp i believe jq defaults ajax to getâ€¦ not 100% on that.
[15:18:52] <Tobsn> hmm why does .post() turn into GET when i set type "json" ?
[15:18:55] <johnywp> the problem of course is that I would NEED the page to reload in order for the php to get the values
[15:19:18] <gnarf> Tobsn: is it cross domain?
[15:19:22] <Tobsn> yep
[15:19:26] <gnarf> cuz you can't cross domain ajax
[15:19:30] <johnywp> i just want it to show the loading gif WHILE the process is doing its thing
[15:19:30] <Tobsn> GET is working
[15:19:32] <Tobsn> post not?
[15:19:33] <johnywp> does that make sense?
[15:19:37] <gnarf> ?sop
[15:19:37] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[15:19:43] <jklmnop> johnywp not necessarily. just check to see if those values are there before you send headersâ€¦ and echo whatever you want to echo and die
[15:19:45] <gnarf> Tobsn: its trying to use ?jsonp
[15:19:45] <bot-t> Tobsn, JSONP, Quickly Â« plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[15:19:53] <Tobsn> yeah but why wouldnt that support POST?
[15:20:10] <gnarf> you can't JSONP with POST
[15:20:13] <gnarf> it just doesn't work
[15:20:19] <Tobsn> well you can
[15:20:25] <Tobsn> but obviously it isnt supported
[15:20:28] <johnywp> i have an IF statement at the beginning of the process that checks if an input is blank
[15:20:38] <Tobsn> hmm that sucks
[15:20:41] <johnywp> if it is, it display some text - if it's not it begins processing
[15:20:57] <johnywp> as it is - nothing happens if I just input the values without clicking on submit
[15:21:01] <Tobsn> thanks for the info, already thought its like that but thanks for validating :)
[15:21:03] <jklmnop> johnywp: you can use if(!empty($_POST))
[15:21:07] <Tobsn> (btw. you cant find anything about it online)
[15:21:14] <johnywp> and if I click on submit the page reloads and takes a long while
[15:21:18] <gnarf> Tobsn: no, you really can't... the technique involves creating a <script> tag with a src pointing at the resource for jsonp --- you can't turn that into a POST
[15:21:39] <johnywp> i don't mind the page reloading - i just don't want the visitors to see a half loaded page while the proccess php is working
[15:22:08] <jklmnop> johnywp preventDefault inside of your submit binding should stop the page from reloading
[15:22:15] <johnywp> ok
[15:22:44] <jklmnop> johnywp: or you can return falseâ€¦ if you want. it really doesn't matter
[15:22:46] <danzik17> Tobsn: if you own/control both domains (meaning you can host stuff on them), you can use window.postMessage and iframes to accomplish cross domain posts, but beyond that you're SOL
[15:22:48] <johnywp> like that? j123('#dealsearcherForm').bind( 'submit', function() { .preventDefault
[15:23:48] <jklmnop> johnywp yeah, just make sure that you pass something into that submit callbackâ€¦ like e or event. so you can access it inside the anon callback blockâ€¦ you know, exactly like i did it in the fiddle i sent you
[15:23:58] <Tobsn> gnarf, you can turn that into a POST, the request uri can accept a callback param along with POST data - so you post data to bla.php?callback=? which would work and in reverse the output send to to jquery would be a solid return too
[15:24:27] <Tobsn> i mean i understand that POST is probably prohibitated from XHR crossdomain, it makes sense in the concept of post but technically it would be possible
[15:24:39] <gnarf> Tobsn: you can't make a <script> tag into a POST... you can't use XHR because of same origin policy
[15:24:41] <Tobsn> because i can do jsonp locally
[15:24:54] <kyledr> posting by $.post ("/my/page", { token: pub.token, data: pub.data, imageDto: { name: pub.title } }, function (response) { // do things }); always gives my webmethod an empty imageDto. any clues why?
[15:25:03] <Tobsn> how does the script tag look with a get?
[15:25:25] <gnarf> <script src="http://blah.com/whatever?something=value
[15:25:35] <Tobsn> and where is that in the request?
[15:25:43] <gnarf> in what request?
[15:25:46] <Tobsn> GET
[15:25:54] <johnywp> jklmnop: i am still not getting it :(
[15:26:02] <gnarf> Tobsn: it is a <script> element
[15:26:06] <Tobsn> its not
[15:26:06] <gnarf> that has its src set
[15:26:08] <Tobsn> its a function
[15:26:17] * gnarf sighs
[15:26:18] <Tobsn> jquery_98ue9fhwefhp9whef({data});
[15:26:19] <Tobsn> thats returned
[15:26:22] <Tobsn> and executed
[15:26:30] <Tobsn> no reason that wouldnt work with POST
[15:26:38] <johnywp> but preventdefault doesn't seem to prevent the reloading
[15:26:41] <gnarf> Tobsn: yes, there is
[15:26:49] <gnarf> you can't actually send the request as a POST to a different domain
[15:26:56] <Tobsn> ooooh
[15:26:58] <Tobsn> i get it
[15:27:05] <tolland> hey
[15:27:14] <gnarf> Tobsn: good, cuz i was getting REALLY tired of arguing it with you
[15:27:17] <Tobsn> with jsonp it generates a script tag with the GET as source
[15:27:27] <Tobsn> and after executes the callback function
[15:27:30] <Tobsn> ;)
[15:27:31] <tolland> is there something similar to vaadin that uses jquery? ( i mean with support for EMF and java?)
[15:27:36] <Tobsn> forgot about that part
[15:27:37] <Tobsn> sorry
[15:27:38] * gnarf nods, thats how jsonp gets "around" the same origin policy
[15:28:19] <Tobsn> hmm. well, get it is...
[15:28:49] <gnarf> if you intend to support jsonp, it MUST be a GET
[15:29:03] <gnarf> or noone will be able to use it except your own domain :)
[15:29:43] <Tobsn> yeah... kind sucks, its a lot of data
[15:29:49] <Tobsn> but i guess i can split it
[15:30:07] <xp_prg> how do I hide a div just when I define it like <div id="mydiv">blah</div> ?  do I add the property style="display:none" ?
[15:30:16] <Tobsn> just gonna set a url length of 800 and if the length is over it moves the other stuff to another request
[15:30:18] <Tobsn> that would work
[15:32:46] <Synycyl> I've got dynamically generated code via PHP that I want jquery to work with.  I want a div to toggle another div inside of the same container, but these divs do not have names or ids.  The classes could be used in a number of these (news page articles that I want to collapse using .toggle())
[15:33:14] <Synycyl> can it be done without ids or names?
[15:34:37] <kyledr> what's the proper way to post a JSON object to a webserver with $.post? I've tried $.post("/url/blah", { image: { name: "name" } }, ...)
[15:36:37] <khmer_> kyledr: when you pass a literal object in like that, $.post attempts to turn it into a post dictionary, type application/x-form-www-urlencoded
[15:36:56] <khmer_> kyledr: stringify your json and send it as a string, and $.post will send it unmolested
[15:37:18] <khmer_> kyledr: you can hand-build that json, or use JSON.stringify()
[15:37:30] <khmer_> if you do the latter and you support IE<8, use the json2.js polyfill
[15:38:31] <chovy> is <div id="MATH-100"> a valid id? I'm not sure it's working in IE9
[15:39:41] <khmer_> that's valid
[15:39:53] <kyledr> khmer_: maybe i need to set the content type to application/json?
[15:40:06] <khmer_> kyledr: oh, definitely also that
[15:41:19] <bbrandon> chovy: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_standard_id.asp
[15:42:42] <kyledr> khmer_: so basically i shouldn't be using $.post but rather $.ajax
[15:43:36] <chovy> $("img").load(function(){ // do something once loaded }); does not appear to work in Opera and IE.
[15:47:27] <frewsxcv> thoughts? http://pastie.org/2764600 about wrapping my js files in anonymous functions
[15:48:22] <chovy> This doesn't work in ie9? item.data('isbn', isbn);
[15:51:55] <aghouseh> if a jquery plugin says it supports the 'default' events, is there a way to trigger an event after it has run/loaded?
[15:53:49] <ryanneufeld> ?p @chovy
[15:53:50] <bot-t> chovy, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:56:01] <SkyFlyer> question.  when trying to do a jsonp and adding  callback=? to the end. my object is now wrapped in  ?({}) like that?  how to I get that data out?
[16:01:33] <chovy> ryanneufeld: of course my fiddle example works :)
[16:01:50] <ryanneufeld> chovy: the you probably need to check the scope of your variables
[16:02:02] <ryanneufeld> chances are you didn't var item anywhere
[16:02:19] <chovy> it works in ff, saf, and chr.
[16:02:43] <ryanneufeld> lets see your fiddle
[16:03:26] <chovy> http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/rzVan/1/
[16:04:00] <WillMarshall> Can I customize the helper used on Draggable when I'm using helper: "clone" ?
[16:04:16] <chovy> i'm thinking the 'item' hasn't been created yet before item.data() is called in the real code.
[16:04:52] <ryanneufeld> chovy: the example you posted works yes, but lets see all your code
[16:05:09] <chovy> SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'data'
[16:06:12] <ryanneufeld> chovy: If you can't show all the code you have, so we have context in what you're working with, we can't help you.
[16:06:19] <ryanneufeld> posting an error message doesn't help
[16:06:43] <chovy> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/rzVan/2/
[16:06:51] <chovy> i added the code in a comment.
[16:07:47] <ryanneufeld> you're on your own dude
[16:08:25] <ryanneufeld> snippets of code with no context aren't useful in debugging
[16:08:26] <chovy> ryanneufeld: ok, let me paste the entire function.

[16:11:29] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/rzVan/4/
[16:11:31] <ryanneufeld> look at that
[16:11:37] <ryanneufeld> I found your problem
[16:11:43] <ryanneufeld> and all you had to do was show me your code
[16:12:08] <chovy> sorry :_)
[16:12:11] <chovy> and thank you.
[16:12:12] <ryanneufeld> chovy: the syntax highlghting is helpful as well
[16:12:18] <ryanneufeld> use it
[16:12:31] <chovy> that was it.
[16:12:32] <ryanneufeld> don't rely on it, but if the colors change, look and see why
[16:12:36] <ryanneufeld> the comma
[16:12:43] <chovy> vim doesn't make a distinction.
[16:12:45] <ryanneufeld> yeah, like I said, you didn't var item ;)
[16:12:52] <ryanneufeld> don't use vim
[16:13:31] <ryanneufeld> use textmate if you're on OSX
[16:13:48] <ryanneufeld> if you're on linux, I'd suggest kate
[16:14:02] <coldhead> that editor is for girls
[16:14:08] <tharkun> ryanneufeld: what cli editor do you suggest for linux?
[16:14:11] <chovy> lol
[16:14:15] <ryanneufeld> tharkun: I don't
[16:14:22] <chovy> what do men use?
[16:14:34] <coldhead> emacs
[16:14:37] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: go use emacs
[16:14:38] <ryanneufeld> lol
[16:14:45] <ryanneufeld> emacs is a great OS
[16:14:50] <ryanneufeld> it just needs a decent text editor
[16:14:57] <tharkun> lol
[16:14:58] <coldhead> you are in my emacs right now, ryanneufeld
[16:15:12] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: I'm in ur emacs, doin stuff
[16:15:14] <ch3mical> Are we back on the emacs discussion again?
[16:15:17] <ryanneufeld> no
[16:15:20] <ch3mical> ;p
[16:15:27] <ryanneufeld> just the not using CLI ediors
[16:15:28] <bbrandon> i love gvim!
[16:15:34] <ch3mical> gvim bleh
[16:15:44] <chovy> emacs is for sadomasicists.
[16:15:51] <ryanneufeld> I use ZendStudio
[16:15:53] <tharkun> Well a lightweight gui editor?
[16:15:53] * ryanneufeld ducks
[16:15:58] <ryanneufeld> tharkun: kate
[16:16:07] <ryanneufeld> tharkun: has konsole built in
[16:16:13] <chovy> I always thought Netscape Gold was the best.
[16:16:15] <tharkun> ryanneufeld: kate has kde as a dependency, not exactly light
[16:16:19] <chovy> untijl i learned vi
[16:16:22] <ryanneufeld> tharkun: gedit
[16:16:36] <ryanneufeld> tharkun: I don't know I was a KDE user
[16:16:39] <ryanneufeld> I'm on osx now
[16:16:42] <ch3mical> Just use Geany if you want something lightweigh
[16:16:42] <tharkun> ryanneufeld: gedit has gnome as a dependency, ...
[16:16:43] <ch3mical> t
[16:16:51] <ch3mical> I think it comes with Ubuntu these days
[16:17:01] <coldhead> emacs is for people who enjoy lisp
[16:17:12] <ch3mical> coldhead: I code with a lisp
[16:17:16] <coldhead> kate is for people who enjoy being a woman named kate
[16:17:17] <ryanneufeld> tharkun: scite is good
[16:17:29] <ryanneufeld> thought I haven't used in a while
[16:17:44] <coldhead> on the commmand line, ed is the standard editor
[16:18:01] <coldhead> for everything else, there's mastercard
[16:18:05] <tharkun> I am a long time vi user, but since javascript is a must these days, and syntax highlight is allways a nice feature ...
[16:18:34] <coldhead> javascript in vim with gf3's setup is nirvana
[16:18:55] <gf3> NO NO U
[16:19:30] <coldhead> http://github.com/gf3/dotfiles/tree/master/.vim/
[16:19:53] <coldhead> with those dotfiles i went from loading files instantly to loading them in around 10 seconds
[16:20:00] <coldhead> giving me valuable thinking time
[16:20:11] <gf3> coldhead: yeah, that sucks
[16:20:38] <ch3mical> I say use sed/awk
[16:20:45] <ch3mical> :D
[16:21:27] <chovy> coldhead: gf3's?
[16:21:45] <coldhead> yuh, ^^ that guy
[16:21:59] <chovy> heh
[16:22:15] <chovy> he doesn't have javascript.vim file.
[16:22:39] <coldhead> oh, maybe he doesn't use javascript
[16:22:42] <chovy> I found this: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1491, but it really only colors 'this' green. Didn't catch the ; error I had.

[16:35:55] <linux_dr1> anyone know a good SOAP plugin? I'm using one that has been abandoned, and don't want to start taking up maintenance for it... a bug or two that I don't think can be worked around without modifying the plugin code.
[16:36:35] <linux_dr1> (the code of this particular plugin... not the jquery plugin code.)

[16:38:33] <patrick99e99> howdy jquery friends...  I was just trying to refine a list of jQuery elements by removing the first one, and found that .shift() does not work on jQuery objects...  What is the best way to do $('.my_class')[1..-1]  ?
[16:38:34] <linux_dr1> based on the same source... the original author did a slightly newer one. jqSOAPClient.beta.js .... He isn't maintinging either anymore.
[16:38:37] <patrick99e99> so I get everything but the first..

[16:43:15] <PhonicUK> hey all, for some reason $("#mySpan").html("hello<br/>world"); is showing <br/> as text - am I missing something?
[16:44:02] <coldhead> try wrapping it all in a span
[16:44:08] <coldhead> or similar
[16:44:22] <coldhead> you're trying to insert bare text and jQuery wants html from you
[16:44:36] <PhonicUK> righto
[16:44:59] <PhonicUK> hmm, i'm gonna end up with lots of nested spans
[16:45:01] <PhonicUK> meh, no matter
[16:45:25] <macheleon> Drupal doesn't seem to mind
[16:45:39] <PhonicUK> unluess there's a better way to put line breaks in text?
[16:45:53] <eddiemonge> PhonicUK: try it with <br> for fun
[16:46:21] <PhonicUK> no dice
[16:46:35] <PhonicUK> also <span>hello<br/>world</span> doesn't work either
[16:46:43] <PhonicUK> the spans don't show, but the break does
[16:47:01] <linux_dr> Just looking at the jquery ajax code and wondering if I found a "protect them from their own stupidity" bug...  according to w3c XMLHttpRequest, setting an ajax header that matches the following pattern should be ignored, but some browsers produce an error:  /^(accept-(charset|encoding)|content-length|(content-)?transfer-encoding|cookie2?|date|expect|host|keep-alive|referer|te|trailer|upgrade|user-agent|via)$/i
[16:47:11] <eddiemonge> PhonicUK: works fine for me: http://jsfiddle.net/UPKjf/
[16:47:29] <PhonicUK> hmm
[16:47:37] <PhonicUK> maybe it doesn't like that I'm grabbing the data from an array?
[16:47:48] <WillMarshall> Hey! I'm using a droppable connected to a sortable: the droppable contains elements that look rather different from the sortable
[16:48:12] <WillMarshall> How might I hook into the Sortable() and cause it to render a custom element when it receives a drop event, rather than blindly insert the dragged element?
[16:48:24] <KostasDi> hey! With JQunit, is there a way to implement @before tests?
[16:48:33] <eddiemonge> PhonicUK: i think you need to show the code that is failing
[16:48:48] <WillMarshall> Basically I want to drop my custom helper, rather than the original Droppable
[16:48:51] <PhonicUK> 1 sec...
[16:49:10] <PhonicUK> ah wait my bad
[16:49:23] <PhonicUK> i was moving stuff around in the wrong place
[16:49:33] <linux_dr> Just wondering if jquery should check against that pattern to provide consistent cross-browser results... (I realize it's a quite heavy-handed fix)
[16:50:03] <KostasDi> ** i meant QUnit
[16:54:58] <chovy> Am I doing something stupid here? the load() event never fires in IE: http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/fYptY/
[16:59:06] <xp_prg> so if I have var s = $('body').html() that doesn't actually return a string right, how do I get it to give me a string?
[17:00:40] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: it returns a string
[17:01:07] <eddiemonge> typeof $('body').html() === "string"
[17:01:30] <eddiemonge> chovy: where is that block at? is it in a doc ready block?
[17:01:34] <eddiemonge> or at the end of the page?
[17:01:52] <cantonic> hey guys. firebug tells me that there is a syntax error in http://pastebin.com/KhsCfVtQ
[17:01:54] <cantonic> can you find it?
[17:02:11] <chovy> eddiemonge: it's in jquery ready()
[17:02:32] <xp_prg> well shouldn't I be able to run a regex test on it then?  ex:  var s = 'wow';s.test(/^wow$/);
[17:02:32] <eddiemonge> chovy: it is? that function wrapper isnt a .ready()
[17:02:49] <chovy> $(function(){ //include my block here }):
[17:02:50] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: you should be able to yes
[17:03:12] <xp_prg> I get s.test is not a function
[17:03:23] <xp_prg> I want to find out if a .match has worked or not
[17:03:26] <eddiemonge> cantonic: can you spot it? http://jsfiddle.net/ASTPn/
[17:03:27] <xp_prg> I was told to use .test
[17:03:39] <eddiemonge> ?mdc test
[17:03:40] <bot-t> eddiemonge, test - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Executes the search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string. Returns true or false . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test
[17:04:56] <chovy> eddiemonge: $(function(){ //include my block here }):
[17:06:16] <eddiemonge> xp_prg: it helps to have the right syntax when using something
[17:07:00] <eddiemonge> chovy: what is .cover .thumb? how do you know the callback isnt firing?
[17:08:08] <thetrav> ok, so $("input#myInput).click(function() { do stuff }) is how I add a click handler, but how do I refer to the element that is being clicked?
[17:08:09] <chovy> because the log doesn't show up for one. I put an alert() in there too and nothing happens in IE.
[17:08:17] <thetrav> do I just add a prameter to the click handler?
[17:08:31] <chovy> .cover .thumb is an img tag.
[17:08:32] <eddiemonge> thetrav: this
[17:08:38] <thetrav> oh?
[17:08:46] <thetrav> that seems quite convenient
[17:08:55] <thetrav> so the handler is somehow stitched onto the html element?
[17:08:56] <thetrav> neato
[17:09:23] <eddiemonge> thetrav: and you should be using $('#myInput') as it will select faster
[17:10:15] <eddiemonge> chovy: .thumb is in the dom right? can you do $('.cover .thumb').hide(); or something similiar in the same spot to make sure the element is getting targetted
[17:10:34] <cantonic> eddiemonge: sorryâ€¦ what do i have to do on the site you showed me?
[17:10:34] <cantonic> 
[17:10:51] <thetrav> eddiemonge: really? findById is quicker than narrowing it down by tag name? aright, thanks for the tip!
[17:11:26] <eddiemonge> cantonic: hit jslint and itll show you some bad stuff but if you look at the code you should be able to figure it out pretty easily
[17:11:56] <eddiemonge> thetrav: it reads right to left so it finds the id first anyway
[17:12:07] <cantonic> eddiemonge: well, everything is generated by rails so i assume there cannot be a syntax error â€¦. :(
[17:12:26] <cantonic> damn, i have too few knowledge in javascript...
[17:12:27] <eddiemonge> cantonic: that doesnt mean anything. rails sucks
[17:12:30] <thetrav> is it possible to do a select by name?
[17:12:40] <eddiemonge> ?selectors @ thetrav
[17:12:41] <bot-t> thetrav, Docs: Selectors - Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document. http://api.jquery.com/category/Selectors/
[17:12:54] <thetrav> ta
[17:12:54] <chovy> eddiemonge: .thumb is an image tag that is statically added in the markup. I'm thinking maybe the image is already loaded by the time it gets to this code, so it never fires.
[17:13:09] <cantonic> eddiemonge: hope this is what you mean: http://jsfiddle.net/ASTPn/
[17:13:57] <eddiemonge> cantonic: this should make it easier to spot the error http://jsfiddle.net/ASTPn/1/
[17:14:09] <xp_prg> eddiemonge, I don't get it, I have a regular expression it matches when I do match, but when I try ith with new RegExp it says it doesn't match
[17:14:12] <eddiemonge> hint: its not in line 1, 3 or 4
[17:14:17] <chovy> eddiemonge: $(".cover .thumb").hide() hides them as expected.
[17:14:21] <xp_prg> very confused
[17:14:42] <eddiemonge> ? eval /^wow$/.test('wow') @ xp_prg
[17:14:43] <bot-t> xp_prg: true
[17:14:55] <eddiemonge> ? eval /^wow$/.test('wowsa') @ xp_prg
[17:14:55] <bot-t> xp_prg: false
[17:15:08] <xp_prg> hmm... ok, can I put the regex in a string though?
[17:15:22] <xp_prg> s = '/^wow$/';
[17:15:54] <eddiemonge> chovy: if you have alert('worked') as the only thing in the callback, does it get fired?
[17:16:03] <chovy> kno
[17:16:04] <chovy> no
[17:16:17] <chovy> i think the images are already loaded in IE.
[17:16:25] <eddiemonge> ? eval var reg = /^wow$/; reg.test('wow') @ xp_prg
[17:16:26] <bot-t> xp_prg: true
[17:16:29] <patrick99e99> so..  $(".foo:gt(1)") will give me [1..-1] of foo..  but what if I already have var x = $(".foo") .. is there a way to add :gt(1) to x ?
[17:16:36] <chovy> I just changed the code a bit with that assumption and it works.
[17:17:06] <chovy> instead of $(".cover .thumb").load(fn); I'm doing $.each($(".cover .thumb"), function(i, x){ });
[17:17:11] <xp_prg> hmm... ok, wow you make it look so easy thanks, you remind of an ice skater making it look easy
[17:17:15] <eddiemonge> chovy: yeah: "In general, it is not necessary to wait for all images to be fully loaded. If code can be executed earlier, it is usually best to place it in a handler sent to the .ready() method."
[17:17:39] <eddiemonge> you could also do $(".cover .thumb").each( function () {} );
[17:17:41] <bapi_> ehm, how can I pass a redirect after a succesfull ajax jquery? I want the user to be redirected to a file
[17:17:46] <cantonic> eddiemonge: i got it :) thank you very much for your patience
[17:17:54] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: still at work, I'll ping you again when im about to leave which is a 20min heads up
[17:17:56] <bapi_> I tried passing <meta http-equiv='refresh'.... but it didn't work

[17:18:10] <chovy> eddiemonge: yeah. .ready() fires before images are loaded, but I need to resize a container for an overlay effect I'm doing on all images.
[17:18:31] <eddiemonge> hmm.http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/jquery_plugin_for_requesting_ajax_like_file_downloads/ @ bapi_
[17:18:35] <chovy> eddiemonge: and resizing it based on the size of the image, which you can't calculate until it is loaded.
[17:19:22] <thebignoise> can .replace take a param to ignore case
[17:19:25] <thebignoise> ?
[17:19:36] <eddiemonge> chovy: instead of the .load, try doing .width() and alert the results of that in the same spot
[17:19:47] <chovy> eddiemonge: i fixed it.

[17:20:12] <eddiemonge> thebignoise: actually, thats a regex question and the answer is yes

[17:20:51] <WillMarshall> Anyone?
[17:21:03] <thebignoise> ah ok thank you

[17:23:02] <WillMarshall> eddiemonge: I'm trying to work out how to custom clone elements when dragging from a Draggable into a Sortable

[17:27:12] <chovy> is there an isLoaded check I can do on images?
[17:29:36] <eddiemonge> Shambat: success: yourfunction
[17:29:52] <Shambat> eddiemonge: ok thanks
[17:34:00] <Shambat> eddiemonge: it doesnt seem to be running, I placed an alert in there, but it wont fire
[17:41:04] <linux_dr> well... I'm not sure jquery should be fixing it, but I did submit a bug report: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10592
[17:42:52] <paul__> anybody here have experience writing plugins?
[17:43:30] <linux_dr> I don't have much... what's your problem? (much more likely to find a solution by sharing that.)
[17:44:03] <paul__> I want to create a plugin that accepts an options object
[17:44:19] <paul__> and i want one of those properties of that object to be a callback
[17:44:29] <paul__> but i dont know how to implement the callback correctly
[17:44:33] <paul__> so that the context is right
[17:44:41] <ProLoser|Work> { callback: function() {} };
[17:44:44] <ProLoser|Work> callback();
[17:44:58] <paul__> ok but inside callback, this refers to window
[17:45:02] <ProLoser|Work> the context will be that which you call the callback in (aka: the plugin)
[17:45:05] <paul__> instead of the jq object?
[17:45:19] <paul__> ok, i must be doing something wrong
[17:45:21] <linux_dr> You don't know how to call the callback? or specify the callback function?
[17:45:22] <ProLoser|Work> no, don't think so, but if you're not sure, don't rely on this and pass arguments to the callback
[17:45:38] <ProLoser|Work> if you MUST use this, you can use apply() or call()
[17:45:41] <paul__> just seems ugly to have to pass this to my callback
[17:45:42] <ProLoser|Work> i don't remember which
[17:45:58] <paul__> i'll have to look at apply and call
[17:46:01] <paul__> i was trying bind
[17:46:05] <ProLoser|Work> it's not jquery
[17:46:07] <ProLoser|Work> it's javascript
[17:46:12] <paul__> ooh
[17:46:21] <ProLoser|Work> Function.apply()
[17:46:28] <ProLoser|Work> lets you explicitly set the scope
[17:46:29] <linux_dr> ProLoser|Work: thanks... Yes was just going to mention call and apply
[17:46:43] <paul__> ok ill check it out
[17:48:07] <linux_dr> If memory call lets you specify an array of function arguments, apply requires you to provide each argument in turn... both let you set the scope.
[17:48:30] <paul__> yeah thats what it looks like
[17:48:54] <linux_dr> paul__: I get them mixed up now and then... but the intent is the same.
[17:57:36] <linux_dr> Hmm... speaking of plugin questions... How would I replace a plugin function with my own version?
[18:00:31] <linux_dr> I tried something like the following, but it didn't work:
[18:00:33] <linux_dr> $.fooPluginFunction = (function() { var originalFooPluginFunction = $.fooPluginFunction; return (function(funcInput) { return baz(originalFooPluginFunction(baz(funcInput))); }); })();
[18:01:06] <paul__> maybe what i want to do isn't normal
[18:01:30] <linux_dr> normal???
[18:01:33] <paul__> but i remember being irritated once that a plugin i was using (uploadify maybe?) had callbacks that had no way to reference $(this)
[18:01:43] <linux_dr> passing a callback? that's pretty typical.
[18:02:09] <paul__> uploadify had a callback like, beforeupload, but when you declare beforeupload you have no way to reference the uploadify object - you have to use unique IDs
[18:02:39] <linux_dr> paul__: this is always defined... $(this) only makes sense if this is something sizzle knows how to deal with.
[18:03:03] <paul__> lemme put an example in pastie
[18:03:05] <paul__> probably easier
[18:03:26] <bfred> do you know any good alternatives to FancyBox? it's getting old
[18:06:59] <paul__> linux_dr if you are still here: http://pastie.org/2765204
[18:07:39] <paul__> or ProLoser|Work of course
[18:10:43] <ProLoser|Work> nope i'm heading home
[18:10:44] <ProLoser|Work> toodles
[18:10:45] <linux_dr> paul__ having some trouble reading it, but have you tried putting the function definitions in ()s?
[18:10:57] <linux_dr> ProLoser: g'night
[18:11:13] <paul__> nope
[18:11:26] <paul__> pretty sure that's invalid?
[18:11:48] <linux_dr> a function is just like any other object..
[18:12:11] <paul__> maybe i misunderstand what you mean?
[18:12:28] <paul__> the function definition in my settings object?
[18:12:31] <paul__> wrap that in ()?
[18:12:45] <paul__> Sodamodo: beforeINject: (function...
[18:12:49] <linux_dr> Yeh....
[18:12:58] <linux_dr> I'm a bit confused what this is trying to do...
[18:13:26] <paul__> you target a ul
[18:13:30] <paul__> and it takes the last LI
[18:13:33] <paul__> and moves it to the top
[18:13:36] <paul__> waits
[18:13:37] <paul__> then repeats
[18:14:35] <paul__> and i want to be able to fire a custom function before and after the dom is modified
[18:16:41] <linux_dr> what is $this???
[18:17:02] <paul__> its a temp variable so that the context is not lost inside of setTimeout
[18:17:28] <paul__> it's set on line 11
[18:17:43] <linux_dr> Oh... didn't see where it was defined... bad name.. :(
[18:17:49] <paul__> :)
[18:18:01] <paul__> I thought it was a good name!
[18:18:03] <linux_dr> personally I think $ was a bad name too... but it's for a good reason.
[18:18:51] <paul__> up until line 19 its just a cookie cutter plugin
[18:18:58] <linux_dr> give me a minute.
[18:19:08] <paul__> it gets a little wonky because of settimeout and the recursion
[18:19:53] <Eviltwin> What is this?
[18:21:22] <linux_dr> so you need something like:  settings.beforeInject.call($this,moveThis);
[18:21:46] <linux_dr> paul__ that look ok?
[18:22:18] <paul__> yeah, i tried that first
[18:22:27] <Eviltwin> Why aren't you doing setTimeout(...this.each(...)...) instead of this.each(...setTimeout(...)...) ?
[18:22:27] <paul__> and nothing happens, i'm trying to figure out why
[18:22:59] <paul__> EvileTwin that is a good question
[18:23:07] <patrick99e99> if I have something like <li><a href="foo.com">blah</a></li> ...  can I do $('li').click(fn(e) { e.stopPropagation(); } ) .. and have it make it so that clicking on either the <a> or the <li> (say it has a lot of padding) from going to foo.com?
[18:23:08] <linux_dr> are you sure $this and moveThis are getting the correct value?
[18:23:16] <paul__> yes they are
[18:23:20] <paul__> it works
[18:23:30] <paul__> the elements rotate in a continuous loop
[18:23:37] <linux_dr> also, I suggest putting the beforeInject and afterInject default values in ()s
[18:23:43] <Eviltwin> patrick99e99: Assuming you mean .click(function(e){... yes
[18:24:06] <patrick99e99> Eviltwin: yeah..  hmm ok.. it doesn't seem to be working.. ill investigate
[18:24:18] <Eviltwin> Oh
[18:24:23] <Eviltwin> You actually want e.preventDefault()
[18:24:24] <linux_dr> paul__: also odd that you never detach the last child elements
[18:24:26] <Eviltwin> I lied
[18:24:41] <paul__> no need to detach them?
[18:24:46] <paul__> you are moving it...
[18:24:54] <paul__> or i should say, it is moving it
[18:24:59] <linux_dr> need to? not sure... that's what I'd do..
[18:25:20] <paul__> if you console.log($this.length) it never changes
[18:25:52] <linux_dr> how many ULs are you manipulating?
[18:25:58] <paul__> right now just one
[18:26:07] <paul__> but in theory it would work for all that are selected
[18:26:20] <patrick99e99> Eviltwin: aha
[18:26:26] <linux_dr> I have to look up the details on each, but it might break beyond that.
[18:27:21] <linux_dr> also, any chance the issue is you are getting a jQuery object instead of a dom element? that can often trip you up.
[18:27:24] <paul__> i basically just copied this: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[18:27:57] <paul__> no, i dont think so. i followed those instructions closely, (#2 context)
[18:28:25] <Eviltwin> .each gives dom elements
[18:28:30] <paul__> right
[18:29:03] <linux_dr> did you put a breakpoint in either of your default callbacks?
[18:29:15] <Eviltwin> So what's the problem?
[18:29:20] <Eviltwin> Not being able to run those functions?
[18:30:00] <Whirl3d> How do I determine the position of the cursor within a text input field or textarea element?
[18:30:01] <paul__> Eviltwin: right, i want to fire settings.beforeInject on line 21
[18:30:33] <paul__> and i want the context for it to be the jq object or element (doesnt' matter) that the plugin is bound to
[18:31:44] <paul__> hang on i think i found something
[18:32:24] <paul__> settings.beforeInject.call($this,moveThis);
[18:32:31] <paul__> works
[18:32:40] <paul__> and im afraid to tell you why it didn't work before ;)
[18:32:50] <linux_dr> try us?
[18:32:55] <paul__> lol
[18:33:07] <Eviltwin> I would suggest this: http://pastie.org/2765303
[18:33:18] <paul__> i had overridden my default function which had the debug code in it on the html page where i was applying the function :(
[18:33:36] <paul__> i console.log(settings.beforeInject) and then smacked my forehead
[18:33:38] <linux_dr> paul__: that will do it.
[18:33:42] <paul__> lol
[18:34:49] <paul__> man, this is great
[18:35:04] <paul__> thanks so much for the help, call and apply are what i've always been looking for
[18:38:12] <paul__> next question is: is there an reason not to calling my plugin recursively
[18:38:15] <paul__> ?
[18:38:37] <Eviltwin> It's pretty wasteful
[18:38:44] <Eviltwin> http://pastie.org/2765303
[18:38:53] <linux_dr> was gonna mention that... you're not REALLY doing a deeply nested recursive call, because you're just scheduling a timer.
[18:39:16] <paul__> so in that case i have to figure out how to make an init method
[18:39:20] <paul__> and an update method
[18:40:01] <paul__> Eviltwin, does your code break chainability?
[18:40:23] <paul__> because it doesn't return..
[18:40:53] <Eviltwin> http://pastie.org/2765303
[18:40:54] <Eviltwin> Now it does
[18:41:12] <Eviltwin> Honestly...of all things to nitpick about
[18:41:21] <paul__> i'm not nitpicking
[18:41:26] <paul__> i just dont want my first plugin to be wrong
[18:41:51] <paul__> ive used a lot of plugins and you can tell the ones that are well written and the ones that aren't
[18:42:15] <Eviltwin> Well there are legitimate reasons to have a plugin that doesn't chain
[18:42:29] <linux_dr> paul What do you mean it doesn't return?
[18:42:43] <xp_prg> hi all, how do I add a div that is hidden to the body?
[18:42:46] <paul__> if it returns an intrinsic value
[18:42:50] <paul__> like height()
[18:42:51] <Eviltwin> linux_dr: The original thing I pasted didn't return this
[18:42:56] <paul__> then yeah...
[18:43:06] <Eviltwin> paul__: Other reasons too
[18:43:11] <Eviltwin> Can you think of any?
[18:43:17] <paul__> not off hand?
[18:43:32] <Eviltwin> Lets say you wanted to be able to start and stop the carousel
[18:43:37] <Eviltwin> Wanted that functionality
[18:43:40] <linux_dr> oh... yes.. I wasn't sure WHAT it returned, but yes.. just was saying you *DO* return (as in flow of control)
[18:44:59] <xp_prg> hello?
[18:45:07] <paul__> then you would call $("UL").carousel('stop');
[18:45:27] <Eviltwin> That is one approach
[18:45:31] <paul__> per the Plugin Methods sample in  http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[18:45:37] <Eviltwin> Yes
[18:45:40] <Whirl3d> how do I deteremine the "i-beam" cursor position within a text input element or textarea element?
[18:45:41] <paul__> i know what you mean
[18:45:43] <Eviltwin> There are several solutions to this problem
[18:45:50] <paul__> you could return the plugin object, and call stop();
[18:45:59] <Eviltwin> One is you have .carousel() and .carouselStop() and .carouselStart() etc
[18:46:09] <Eviltwin> One is to have .carousel() and .carousel("stop") and .carousel("start")
[18:46:14] <paul__> yeah but thats specifically stated as being a nono
[18:46:20] <Eviltwin> One is you have .carousel() return an object that has .start() and .stop()
[18:46:29] <paul__> yup yup
[18:46:38] <paul__> so it's all just preference then?
[18:46:53] <Eviltwin> All of those work and all of those have different benefits and disadvantages
[18:47:38] <paul__> to be honest, the authoring document is the first time i've seen the .carousel("stop") way
[18:48:02] <Eviltwin> Then I guess you've never used jQuery UI
[18:48:16] <paul__> i have maybe once
[18:48:22] <paul__> just to embed a calendar widget
[18:49:15] <Eviltwin> IT's tge waya
[18:49:18] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[18:49:21] <Eviltwin> It's the way all jQuery UI widgets work
[18:49:26] <paul__> gotcha
[18:49:29] <Eviltwin> Really beautiful scheme
[18:49:35] <Eviltwin> Takes care of a lot of the mess for you
[18:49:35] <paul__> but?
[18:49:49] <Eviltwin> There's a little bit of overhead
[18:50:02] <Eviltwin> And everything needs to be done through .myWidgetName("action goes here",...)
[18:50:07] <Eviltwin> From the outside
[18:50:19] <Eviltwin> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138135/Widget%20factory
[18:50:36] <Eviltwin> But consider your .carousel plugin
[18:50:41] <paul__> yeah, it's a bit wonky
[18:50:46] <Eviltwin> If you call .carousel() then call .carousel("stop") later
[18:50:57] <Eviltwin> Those are different function calls
[18:51:08] <Eviltwin> That don't share the same settings object etc.
[18:51:17] <paul__> they can though right?
[18:51:22] <paul__> you make your init use data()...
[18:51:23] <Eviltwin> Not directly
[18:51:38] <Eviltwin> You actually need to fake it
[18:51:55] <Eviltwin> And depending on how you do that, it can be kind of messy
[18:52:06] <Eviltwin> The UI widget factory takes care of all of that stuff for you
[18:52:23] <Eviltwin> You're basically just desigining an object like any other
[18:52:35] <Eviltwin> With methods, instance variables
[18:52:40] <Eviltwin> etc
[18:52:48] <Eviltwin> And different functions
[18:53:02] <Eviltwin> Special methods like _create, _destroy, _setOption etc.
[18:53:09] <paul__> yeah i see that
[18:53:17] <Eviltwin> So it helps keep things a lot cleaner
[18:53:22] <paul__> so i might be farther ahead to make my plugin from the factory
[18:53:51] <Eviltwin> Your plugin will be easier to make more feature rich if you use the widget factory
[18:54:52] <paul__> long story short, the before and after methods will allow me to apply class names to my elements, which will cause them to animate in instead of just appearing if used in webkit/gecko
[18:54:53] <Eviltwin> And it will be chainable
[18:55:07] <paul__> so im just happy i got that far :)
[18:55:20] <paul__> but the factory will definitely take some investigation
[18:56:06] <Eviltwin> I don't think it's out yet, but the widget factory is going to be getting more powerful with the ability to extend existing widgets
[18:56:28] <Eviltwin> Being able to add to the existing functionality, replace it, or just use the existing functionality
[18:57:20] <paul__> it should be nice, i hate how all the plugins are different
[18:57:23] <paul__> have to learn each one
[18:58:32] <Eviltwin> THis is one way of standardizing them
[18:58:59] <Whirl3d> Jeesh, you two. When's the wedding?
[18:59:30] <Eviltwin> ?
[19:00:24] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: you around?
[19:00:46] <brigdaddy> what's the proper way to deal with dependencies when developing a jquery plugin? append a script tag to <head>? make the user include them? minify into one file?
[19:01:29] <Eviltwin> brigdaddy: Depends on the dependency but frequently the last
[19:01:52] <Eviltwin> jQuery includes the Sizzle selector engine
[19:02:06] <Eviltwin> Because selectors are at the root of its functionality
[19:02:48] <brigdaddy> at the moment i've only got one extra js file to worry about
[19:02:59] <paul__> alright im out, thanks again for the help
[19:03:25] <Eviltwin> Not a question of the number of files but more how much code, how long it takes to run, and if it can be safely run multiple times wihtout A) causing problems or B) wasting a bunch of time
[19:03:37] <Eviltwin> For example the json2.js library
[19:03:52] <brigdaddy> multiple times meaning if its included more than once?
[19:03:53] <Eviltwin> Not a lot of code
[19:04:04] <brigdaddy> it's
[19:04:10] <Eviltwin> But if the JSON functions already exist, it does like nothing
[19:04:18] <Eviltwin> Just checks to see that they exist and then exists
[19:04:38] <Eviltwin> So if the user is already using that library in their code
[19:04:43] <Eviltwin> And you're using it too in yours
[19:04:48] <Eviltwin> Make sure that's not going to be a problem
[19:05:05] <devaholic> https://github.com/tblobaum/nodeQuery
[19:05:18] <Eviltwin> Like how jQuery plugins are designed to not rely on $ being jQuery
[19:05:44] <brigdaddy> okay sounds good. what about including jquery? or ui.widget.js that i use?
[19:06:03] <brigdaddy> i guess ui.widget.js counts as a dependency too
[19:06:05] <Eviltwin> If it's a jQuery plugin
[19:06:08] <Eviltwin> Don't include jQuery
[19:06:11] <Eviltwin> jQuery is juge
[19:06:12] <Eviltwin> huge*
[19:06:37] <devaholic> nodequery is a jquery plugin, but its a lot more than that
[19:10:18] <brigdaddy> okay so i could just pack my plugin code, the widget code, and my dependency into one file and require the user to include jquery themselves?
[19:11:12] <devaholic> why wouldnt they already have jquery on their site
[19:14:53] <brigdaddy> maybe they aren't using it anywhere else?
[19:16:00] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: heading home now... maybe you will return.
[19:29:52] <domino14> i have a div that pops up, and i want to hide it on 'blur'. there's a link inside the div. when i click on it, and go to a new page, and then go back to the old page, shouldn't blur get activated?
[19:30:41] <Whirl3d> fld.find(".init.required").filter("['defaultValue']");  will that give me all the elements of class init and required that have the defaultValue attribute defined?
[19:31:49] <Whirl3d> ?$.blur()
[19:31:50] <bot-t> Whirl3d, .blur() - Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[19:33:21] <Whirl3d> domino14, maybe try .focusin .focusout
[19:33:26] <Whirl3d> ?.focusin
[19:33:26] <bot-t> .focusin(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focusin" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/focusin/
[19:34:35] <Whirl3d> olly olly oxen free?
[19:37:16] <Dave_Stein> gnarf: im alive
[19:37:27] * Whirl3d deafened by the uncharacteristic silence of the #jquery channel, hides head in dismay
[19:37:28] <gnarf> Dave_Stein: ui-dev?
[19:37:34] <Dave_Stein> sure thing
[19:38:15] <Dave_Stein> im there :)
[19:44:37] <kvnn> If I have element.click(alert("HI")), how can I make another element.click() prevent the first binding from firing?
[19:44:52] <Whirl3d> e.preventDefault();
[19:45:14] <Whirl3d> ?.stopPropogation
[19:45:15] <bot-t> Whirl3d, event.stopPropagation() - This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[19:45:47] <kvnn> stopPropogation is not the answer correct? let me try preventDefault
[19:45:52] <gf3> kickban kvnn
[19:45:54] <gf3> OOPS
[19:46:02] <gf3> I said OOPS
[19:46:07] <gf3> *wink
[19:46:10] <snover> SOUPS
[19:46:11] <gf3> OOOOPPPS
[19:47:50] <kvnn> neither work
[19:48:06] <kvnn> afaik stopPropogation is so that a container element doesn't recieve the event
[19:48:16] <kvnn> and preventDefault is for stopping an href from firing
[19:48:20] <kvnn> possibly an onclick
[19:48:54] <CannedCorn> hey guys i'm trying to get this effect that fades in/out text in posts on a blog as you scroll over them
[19:49:05] <CannedCorn> in firefox when i scroll down on my mac it fades them in and out
[19:49:10] <kvnn> ?.fadeIn
[19:49:14] <bot-t> .fadeIn([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements by fading them to opaque. http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[19:49:14] <CannedCorn> but in chrome it like locks the mouse position
[19:49:20] <CannedCorn> yeah i got it working
[19:49:36] <CannedCorn> but it locks the post my mouse is on as faded in on chrome+safari
[19:49:53] <CannedCorn> and doesn't fade out/in new posts as i'm scolling
[19:49:57] <CannedCorn> it like locks the mouse position
[19:52:13] <kvnn> create a jsfiddle and someone can help
[19:52:49] <kvnn> Whirl3d : are you sure that stopProp and preventDefault should work in my case? I don't believe they would (and I've tested)
[19:58:12] <kvnn> If I have element.click(alert("HI")), how can I make another element.click() prevent the first binding from firing?

[20:29:29] <amirite> i have json in an iframe or window, how do I get its raw source with jquery?
[20:29:43] <amirite> browsers seem to artifically wrap head and body and html elements around it
[20:30:08] <ryanneufeld> amirite: why is it in an iframe? Can you get it another way?
[20:30:32] <amirite> because it starts with a redirect to facebook
[20:30:32] <johny_> i am using .ajax to post some form inputs. the url is /page/ and I am then loading a php template which processes the $_POST data. for some reason, the php template that I am loading doesn't seem to get the $_POST data EVEN though the server is making the request.. any ideas?
[20:30:36] <amirite> and facebook returns to my app w
[20:30:41] <johny_> my code is http://pastebin.com/0TMiMxga
[20:30:51] <ryanneufeld> amirite: you can do that with ajax can't you?
[20:31:37] <amirite> no because it will do stuff server-side twice if i do
[20:33:35] <ryanneufeld> amirite: there is a way
[20:34:41] <ryanneufeld> amirite: var theIframe = document.getElementById("iframes-id"); doc = theIframe.contentDocument
[20:34:52] <ryanneufeld> then you can use doc to find the body tag
[20:35:11] <johny_> ryanneufeld - would you share your geniusness with me? :)
[20:35:17] <amirite> right
[20:35:19] <amirite> the problem is
[20:35:25] <amirite> that browsers are wrapping crap around it
[20:35:39] <amirite> like <html><head></head><body><pre>the real json</pre></body></html>
[20:35:41] <ryanneufeld> amirite: read what I typed

[20:39:29] <fuho> google i feel lucky? :)
[20:39:44] <ryanneufeld> fuho: google knows everything
[20:40:02] <ryanneufeld> johny_: use firebug and inspect the XHR
[20:40:33] <fuho> You should rewrite the bot to do http://lmgtfy.com/?q=inertial+scroll+jquery&l=1
[20:41:26] <johny_> hmm
[20:41:55] <fuho> ryanneufeld: But thank, will read.
[20:42:11] <jokepan> is the width() value for an element without an explicit width arbitrary?
[20:42:22] <johny_> i see GET page-searcher and then POST
[20:42:25] <devaholic> anyone interested in this https://github.com/tblobaum/nodeQuery ?
[20:42:26] <ryanneufeld> johny_: no
[20:42:34] <johny_> oh
[20:42:49] <ryanneufeld> jokepan: no
[20:42:52] <ryanneufeld> is what I meant
[20:42:55] <jokepan> i have a <div>hello</div> that is 1264 pixels wide. is there anyway to get the true witdth of the content?
[20:43:00] <johny_> ryanneufeld: am i looking at the wrong thing?
[20:43:02] <ryanneufeld> no
[20:43:03] <ryanneufeld> you are
[20:43:07] <ryanneufeld> looking at the right thing
[20:43:08] <ryanneufeld> sorry
[20:43:11] <johny_> ok :)
[20:43:12] <ryanneufeld> sleepy
[20:43:18] <johny_> and it's doing what it should, right?
[20:43:26] <ryanneufeld> I can't see your console
[20:43:27] <ryanneufeld> so I don't know
[20:44:25] <ryanneufeld> if you're expecting it to be doing a post, and it's doing a GET, then you might want to investigate that
[20:44:38] <johny_> nope... it is doing a post
[20:44:51] <johny_> and then I am loading the process php
[20:45:00] <johny_> so, should the process php automatically get the values?
[20:45:31] <Ganjaboi> can anyone help me give me some hits about how to make something simuler to this http://www.valuta.se/currency/showrealtime.aspx
[20:45:47] <johny_> like... if I use post to pass the input ['name'] and then in the process.php i use $name = &_POST['name'], would $name take the input's value?
[20:46:18] <jokepan> ryanneufeld: should $("<div>hello</div>").width() be returning 1264?
[20:46:40] <ryanneufeld> jokepan: maybe?
[20:46:41] <Ganjaboi> refreshing data, if changed highlight it with animation, what functions will make this?
[20:47:12] <ryanneufeld> jokepan: if you have a width set on it with css
[20:47:14] <ryanneufeld> then maybe
[20:47:23] <ryanneufeld> but it depends on a lot of things
[20:48:55] <jokepan> no it's just blank
[20:49:00] <devaholic> Ganjaboi: documentcloud.github.com/backbone/
[20:49:09] <jokepan> only a background color
[20:50:51] <ryanneufeld> jokepan: what's just blank?
[20:50:55] <ryanneufeld> the div?
[20:51:16] <ryanneufeld> ?eval $("<div>hello</div>").width()
[20:51:17] <bot-t> ryanneufeld: TypeError: div is undefined
[20:51:17] <jokepan> i meant no other css
[20:51:51] <ryanneufeld> jokepan: $("<div>hello</div>").width() ==0
[20:53:19] <jokepan> uh oh
[20:54:32] <ryanneufeld> well how could it have any width
[20:54:36] <ryanneufeld> it hasn't been rendered
[20:56:51] <Ganjaboi> devaholic uhm jquery should be able to do this should't it? :S
[20:57:43] <coldhead> jQuery is more about marketing than it is about being useful
[20:57:50] <coldhead> let me send you some mousepads
[20:58:07] <jokepan> ryanneufeld: sorry it's in the dom that was just to make it clearer
[20:58:13] <jokepan> which didn't
[20:58:24] <jokepan> i have <div>hello</div> in my dom
[20:58:54] <ryanneufeld> ?console
[20:58:54] <bot-t> Firebug and the Command Line - http://getfirebug.com/commandline
[20:59:09] <ryanneufeld> ?console @jokepan
[20:59:09] <bot-t> jokepan, Firebug and the Command Line - http://getfirebug.com/commandline
[20:59:12] <ryanneufeld> use it
[20:59:25] <ryanneufeld> console.log the result of the width command
[20:59:26] <ryanneufeld> try it
[20:59:30] <ryanneufeld> you might like it
[20:59:38] <jokepan> i am, it's 1264
[21:01:32] <ryanneufeld> okay
[21:01:41] <ryanneufeld> what's your question then?
[21:02:01] <jokepan> why 1264?
[21:02:11] <ryanneufeld> how should I know?
[21:02:20] <ryanneufeld> what does your CSS say?>
[21:02:31] <ryanneufeld> does it change if you resize the window and run it again?
[21:04:04] <jokepan> yes
[21:04:41] <jokepan> is there any way to get the width of just the hello, or is it out of my control since there's no explicit width set?
[21:07:51] <ngharo> div is a block device
[21:07:56] <ngharo> wrap your text in a span
[21:08:02] <ngharo> or some inline element
[21:08:10] <ngharo> block element*
[21:08:17] <ngharo> been hacking the loonix far too long
[21:08:33] <amh345> is there any reason why my div isnt moving right when i click my href? http://jsfiddle.net/mWW6T/1/
[21:09:03] <jokepan> ah okay thanks a lot that
[21:09:56] <ngharo> amh345: same to you bro.
[21:10:09] <ngharo> amh345: set position to absolute
[21:11:02] <jokepan> ngharo: getting the same thing if i put the text in a <p>
[21:11:19] <amh345> ngharo: hey, that worked. thanks
[21:11:49] <ngharo> jokepan: p is a block element also
[21:11:59] <jokepan> oh :) thanks! i need to read up
[21:12:02] <ngharo> right click and inspect your element
[21:12:15] <ngharo> it should draw a box around the element
[21:12:28] <ngharo> and show you width and crap
[21:12:47] <ngharo> use span for your needs
[21:12:55] <jokepan> perfect thank you so much

[21:42:21] <amirite> is there a way to bind to window close? unload and beforeunload are triggered on link clicks
[21:44:34] <Spadeski>  /join ##php
[21:49:09] <Taggnostr> is $('#foo').ready(function () { $(this).replaceWith(that); }); the right way to replace #foo when it's completely loaded?
[21:49:27] <Taggnostr> #foo is a span with display:none
[21:49:55] <coldhead> #occupycoldhead
[21:55:26] <Mage2> Is there per chance something builtin to jQuery to convert js to json.. or should i be looking externally/plugins
[21:55:33] <abjorn> #occupybeer
[21:55:36] <Mage2> i noticed jquery can parse json but.
[21:56:46] <gmansilla> I have 2 forms with different id's, on of them is inside a query ui dialog, I have a $('#div1).ajaxStart() call, but when I send div2 via ajax I don't know why the first ajaxStart call is triggered, Am I missing somthing?
[21:57:03] <gmansilla> div 2 is in the query ui dialog
[21:57:21] <ngharo> Mage2: some browser have native JSON.stringify()
[21:57:32] <Mage2> right, some do
[21:57:35] <ngharo> but json2.js iirc has cross browser support
[21:57:45] <Mage2> cool, i will check that out
[21:59:09] <Mage2> oh neat it's supported in any browser i care about at the moment
[21:59:14] <Mage2> natively
[21:59:18] <Mage2> groovy :)
[22:01:57] <ryanseddon> ya json2.js is only really for ie7 and down
[22:12:59] <Whirl3d> how do I determine cursor position in a text input element or textarea element?
[22:14:29] <Whirl3d> how do you determine the next element in a tab order from the current focused element?
[22:17:25] <Taggnostr> there's something wrong here, if I use $('#someid').load(...) the function doesn't get called, if I use .ready() it gets called but I'm not sure what $(this) is, because if I try to print its .text() or the text of all its .parents() I don't get anything
[22:19:23] <Taggnostr> ".ready() Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded." <- does this mean the DOM of the whole page?
[22:21:20] <coldhead> yes
[22:21:32] <Taggnostr> ok, so I need something else
[22:22:21] <Taggnostr> I want to replace an element with a given id as soon as possible, without waiting for the whole page to load, what element should I use?
[22:22:27] <coldhead> it sounds like you are doing something complicated
[22:22:33] <Taggnostr> s/element/event/
[22:23:05] <coldhead> i would try polling for the element
[22:23:12] <coldhead> every few milliseconds
[22:23:28] <coldhead> but DOM ready happens pretty quickly
[22:23:32] <coldhead> unless the page is huge
[22:23:37] <coldhead> it doesn't wait for images and such
[22:23:44] <Taggnostr> so there's no way to do it automatically when the element is parsed/rendered or something similar?
[22:23:48] <coldhead> its much cleaner if you can do that
[22:23:58] <coldhead> i don't believe so
[22:24:14] <coldhead> not in jQuery anyway
[22:24:34] <Taggnostr> uhm, I was pretty sure there was a way to do it, but maybe it was in plain js and probably not supported by some browser
[22:24:35] <amh345> im feeling like im on crazypills.  http://jsfiddle.net/wkGMS/    when i click 'proceed' there is some sort of a 3rd 'frame' happening and i cant find what's causing it.
[22:25:09] <Whirl3dOrd3r> are there static variables defined common keycodes like key.TAB or something
[22:25:24] <Taggnostr> coldhead, if there's no easy way to do it I'll just leave it with the .ready()
[22:26:48] <coldhead> there isn't in jquery, Whirl3dOrd3r, but i'm sure you could find such a thing to plugin
[22:27:32] <Whirl3dOrd3r> coldhead, thx. Any suggestions for finding the cursor position in a text input element or textarea element?
[22:28:12] <coldhead> no idea, Whirl3dOrd3r
[22:28:22] <coldhead> i believe it's a hard problem
[22:28:29] <coldhead> browsers differ
[22:29:00] <coldhead> Whirl3dOrd3r: http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/caret
[22:29:00] * Whirl3dOrd3r smacks head...nobody cares about custom input functions for a simple contact sheet.
[22:29:20] <Whirl3dOrd3r> coldhead, thx. I'll check it out
[22:31:25] <amh345> any input on this? http://jsfiddle.net/wkGMS/    clicking proceed shows a 3rd empty div.  or somthing.
[22:35:58] <ryanneufeld> ?hi5 @coldhead
[22:35:59] <bot-t> coldhead, âµ
[22:36:03] <coldhead> may i just remind you http://i.imgur.com/X4LOM.gif
[22:36:22] <ryanneufeld> best gif evar
[22:41:37] <coldhead> it really is, it's exactly how i feel about everything
[22:41:51] <coldhead> like looking in a mirror
[22:48:10] <Cork> amh345: cause your creating three steps
[22:48:27] <amh345> Cork, that's what im trying to find. this extra step.
[22:48:55] <amh345> oh shit.  if else if else?
[22:49:07] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/wkGMS/2/
[22:49:48] <Cork> you code would work if you had three elements
[22:50:24] <Cork> amh345: a better option would prob be to make your code not depend on the number of elements
[22:50:59] <amh345> Cork, thanks, it works now.   i was trying to write it myself but it was not working out so well.  so i grabbed something from stackover f
[22:51:52] <amirite> foo
[22:57:11] <iqbalkhan> excuse me guys
[22:57:17] <iqbalkhan> i used jqGrid

[22:59:34] <iqbalkhan> anyone can help?
[23:04:42] <asher^> hi guys, im using .post to submit some ajax data. im wondering what kind of output i should use on the back end to trigger .error() in jquery?
[23:05:11] <Deele> asher^, what error you would like?
[23:05:19] <Deele> most convinient data type is jSON
[23:05:29] <Deele> it is like associative array
[23:06:05] <Deele> so, you can just add some error: 1 inside jSON, and client side would trigger on it
[23:06:19] <Deele> otherwise, you can just return 0 or error in plaintext
[23:06:27] <asher^> ok, thats cool
[23:06:30] <Deele> but it is less "foolproof"
[23:07:06] <Deele> you will need on serverside, create some assoc array, and then use jSON parser, to generate jSON string
[23:07:14] <Deele> then, pass it as response
[23:07:32] <asher^> essentially {"error": 1} would work?
[23:07:50] <Deele> it should
[23:07:56] <asher^> cool
[23:08:02] <Deele> all now depends on your client side javascript
[23:08:40] <asher^> im using .error() on a $.post
[23:08:49] <asher^> any regular output is considered success?
[23:09:08] <Deele> yes
[23:09:18] <asher^> sweet, ty
[23:09:38] <Deele> so, your .error wont do any good
[23:09:53] <Deele> you need to parse return value inside .success
[23:10:25] <asher^> ah, so the json above wont trigger .error?
[23:10:25] <Deele> .error is only for communication or data parsing errors
[23:10:36] <Deele> no, sorry if that was what you need
[23:10:49] <Deele> you can just trigger any .error inside .success statement
[23:11:53] <asher^> i know .error is triggered if i submit to a non-existant file, can i just return some error header to achieve the same?
[23:16:48] <Deele> asher^, sure
[23:23:54] <johnywp> hey all
[23:24:04] <johnywp> and a special hi to coldhead :)
[23:24:18] <coldhead> right back at you, giant prawn
[23:25:20] <johnywp> I have this code http://pastebin.com/HXJBCC3C through which I am sending some data from a form to the page that i am on without reloading
[23:26:08] <johnywp> once complete, I load a php script which is supposed to take the form data and do stuff with it
[23:26:41] <johnywp> it wasn't working, so I tried <?php var_dump($_POST); ?> to see what data goes through to the php script and nothing does
[23:26:43] <johnywp> any ideas?
[23:31:59] <walid> hi guys!
[23:32:16] <walid> i'm trying waypoint, but i get an error loading it...
[23:32:30] <walid> Ucaught TypeError: Object function (E,F){return new o.fn.init(E,F)} has no method 'isWindow' moijonnais.com/sites/default/files/resources/logo.png
[23:34:48] <Axsuul> hmm why doesn't .data() return a string and instead returns an object
[23:35:04] <Axsuul> isnt .data() like .attr() except for HTML5 data attributes?
[23:36:01] <Axsuul> nmt hey arent
[23:37:07] <Cork> Axsuul: .data returns what ever you put in it, it doesn't have to be a string
[23:37:29] <Cork> it can even be a reference to another dom element
[23:39:20] <walid> i'm not too good at js debugging..
[23:39:34] <Axsuul> thanks
[23:40:29] <Cork> walid: do you have a link?
[23:40:39] <walid> Cork
[23:40:44] <walid> moijconnais.com
[23:40:53] <johnywp> anyone?
[23:40:56] <walid> (you have to remove the top layer to see the content
[23:42:35] <johnywp> I have this code http://pastebin.com/HXJBCC3C through which I am sending some data from a form to the page that i am on without reloading. once complete, I load a php script which is supposed to take the form data and do stuff with it. It wasn't working, so I tried <?php var_dump($_POST); ?> to see what data goes through to the php script and nothing does... any idea how to pass the $_POST data
[23:42:35] <johnywp> to the script?
[23:43:00] <walid> Cork: any idea?
[23:43:21] <Cork> walid: something is overwriting your $ it looks like
[23:43:47] <walid> var $miniCatalog = $('#block-views-records-block_2'); 	$miniCatalog.waypoint(function(){ 		$(this).slideToggle(); 	});
[23:44:36] <Cork> walid: ah!
[23:44:41] <walid> i'll try to print the object
[23:44:48] <Cork> your using the default jquery for drupal
[23:44:50] <Cork> and its too old
[23:44:56] <Cork> you need 1.4+
[23:44:59] <Cork> drupal has 1.3.2
[23:45:01] <walid> right.
[23:45:29] <Cork> actually you need 1.4.3+
[23:46:26] <walid> Cork: you're familiar with drupal?
[23:46:45] <walid> cause i couldn't install the jQueryUpdate module
[23:48:02] <Cork> walid: i used it quite extensivly up to 6.x
[23:49:00] <walid> Cork: cause the module said to put all jquery UI script in sites/all/libraries/jquery.ui/ui/*.js
[23:50:55] <walid> so i installed an old version, the one documented in the module's readme
[23:53:37] <Cork> walid: the problem isn't with jquery.ui
[23:53:43] <Cork> its jquery core thats too old
[23:53:58] <walid> i get that.
[23:54:23] <walid> i'm sorry, i spent a couple of hours trying to install jqueryUpdate
[23:55:06] <walid> but it won't take the 1.6 library
[23:55:24] <Cork> walid: 1.4.3 should be enough
[23:55:36] <Cork> not going past 1.5 should be simpler
[23:55:36] <asher^> hey guys, having a few issues with form submissions using jquery. some of my values (empty ones) are being posted as '', while some are not being posted at all. does anyone know how i can make sure all are posted?
[23:55:50] <walid> Cork: also i include both 1.3 and 1.6
[23:56:00] <walid> Cork: don't know if that's bad
[23:56:05] <Cork> walid: it is
[23:56:12] <walid> lol
[23:56:13] <walid> ok
[23:57:54] <walid> Cork: do you know how to get rid of the old one?
[23:59:35] <walid> Cork: i get so many errors of include with drupal
